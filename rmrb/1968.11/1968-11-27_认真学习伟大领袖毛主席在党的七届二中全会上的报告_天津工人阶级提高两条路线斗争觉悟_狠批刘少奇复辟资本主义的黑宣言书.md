The working class of Tianjin and revolutionary masses from all fronts are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and his latest instructions. They are taking the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's 1949 "Tianjin Speech" as a black target, conducting a thorough and extensive revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly purging Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, greatly raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They are determined to further implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi quickly went to Tianjin and to some large private enterprises at that time, such as the Dongya Wool and Hemp Textile Mill and Yongli Alkali Factory, and threw himself into the arms of the reactionary big capitalists, becoming thick as thieves. He openly advocated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," shouting that capitalists "deserve credit for exploitation," beautifying the bourgeoisie, and ruthlessly suppressing the working class. Under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin, with Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as their weapon, concentrated on criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech" of that year, launching a magnificent new wave of revolutionary criticism. From factories to suburban people's communes, from military barracks to schools, from offices to shops, more than 160,000 people participated in tens of thousands of classes studying Mao Zedong Thought. Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary criticism columns sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The broad revolutionary masses used a large number of historical facts of the struggle between the two lines to denounce Liu Shaoqi's heinous counter-revolutionary crimes, criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies, and purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi. The revolutionary masses indignantly pointed out that Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech" is a thorough and complete black program to betray proletarian dictatorship, a black manifesto for the conspiracy to restore capitalism.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Tianjin Third Textile Mill (formerly Dongya Wool and Hemp Textile Mill) used their personal experiences and a large number of ironclad facts to criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary "exploitation deserves credit" fallacy. The workers said that the big bloodsucker Song Qinyi, who was flatteringly praised by Liu Shaoqi as "civilized" and "progressive" in 1937, made a pure profit of 172 million yuan, while the workers' wages for the entire year were only 11 million yuan; when Song Qinyi first built the Dongya Wool and Hemp Textile Mill, he had only 2.3 million yuan in capital, but by 1948, it had reached 15 billion yuan. The increase in Song Qinyi's capital was a book of exploitation, a piece of iron evidence that workers fed the capitalists and that capitalists became rich by squeezing the blood and sweat of workers. The entire factory's revolutionary workers, with Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as their weapons, set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in more than 100 workshops, conducting a thorough reckoning with Liu Shaoqi's "exploitation deserves credit" fallacy.

In the Hongwei Chemical Factory (formerly the Modern Chemical Factory), which was once praised by Liu Shaoqi as a "red capitalist" model and controlled by Wang Guangying for many years, the workers used vivid, blood-stained facts to expose the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangying colluding to suppress the working class. Wang Guangying, a reactionary capitalist who has always engaged in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property, under the patronage of the number one capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, successively usurped 36 positions, including the Standing Committee of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce and the National People's Congress representative. The reactionary capitalist Wang Guangying gathered a group of ghosts and snakes to control power in the factory, even placing a capitalist as the "union chairman." Old workers angrily denounced that the big scab Liu Shaoqi and the reactionary capitalist Wang Guangying were wearing the same pair of pants. Wang Guangying, for the sake of making huge profits, forced workers to produce flammable and explosive nitrocellulose without any safety equipment, resulting in the "nitrocellulose explosion incident" that shocked the nation in 1954, causing 13 workers to be injured. Afterwards, Wang Guangying was shielded and protected by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. The executioner Wang Guangying has been at large for more than a decade until this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, his crimes were settled. The workers said, Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "exploitation deserves credit" is a smokescreen to cover the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat, a black program that attempts to let the capitalists ride on the heads of the workers again. Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, is a servant of the capitalists and an enemy of the working class. Currently, the workers of this factory are deeply engaged in the work of cleaning up the class ranks in conjunction with the revolutionary criticism, digging out and criticizing a handful of class enemies such as traitors, reactionary capitalists, and counter-revolutionaries planted by the reactionary capitalist Wang Guangying.

In the Tianjin Alkali Factory, the revolutionary workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed and criticized Liu Shaoqi's crimes of relying on capitalists and crazily pushing the bourgeois reactionary line in the early days of liberation. In 1949, the reactionary capitalists of the predecessor of the Tianjin Alkali Factory, Yongli Alkali Factory, forced workers to reduce wages and dismiss workers without reason. At that time, the workers stood up to fight against the capitalists, surrounding the capitalists' offices and dormitories. Just as the workers were winning victory after victory, Liu Shaoqi suddenly came to Yongli Alkali Factory in May 1949, shook hands and chatted with the reactionary capitalists, took photos together, and blatantly incited the capitalists, saying: "You have three powers, namely, the power to control finances, the power to manage administration, and the power to use personnel. For the needs of production, the employers should have the freedom to hire or fire workers." Liu Shaoqi gave the power to the capitalists, and the capitalists said with murderous intent: "Even if we burn a pot of caustic soda, we will make the bones of these poor fellows soft." In this way, the capitalists dismissed 83 workers in a row. The workers appealed to the people's court, but under Liu Shaoqi's shielding and protection, the capitalists won the "lawsuit." The workers of the Tianjin Alkali Factory only realized during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that this was the trick played by the big scab Liu Shaoqi. The workers said, even if the Haihe River were dried up, it would not be enough to write about the hatred of the working class towards Liu Shaoqi, nor would it be enough to denounce Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly talked about, repeatedly talked about. It is not enough to talk to a few people, it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, the working class of Tianjin and the broad revolutionary masses have re-studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studied the important editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, reviewed the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, especially the history of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, which has further aroused their boundless love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and their deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The broad revolutionary masses are determined to combine the revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech" with a deeper development of the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further comprehensively implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, launch a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    认真学习伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告
    天津工人阶级提高两条路线斗争觉悟  狠批刘少奇复辟资本主义的黑宣言书
    革命群众决心结合对刘少奇《天津讲话》的大批判，更加深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，掀起斗、批、改的新高潮
    新华社天津二十六日电　天津市工人阶级和各条战线上的广大革命群众，认真学习伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告和毛主席的最新指示，把党内头号走资派刘少奇一九四九年的《天津讲话》作为黑靶子，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，极大地提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们决心进一步贯彻落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，认真搞好斗、批、改，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在党的七届二中全会以后不久就跑到天津，跑到当时的东亚毛麻纺织厂、永利碱厂等一些大的私营企业，一头扎在反动的大资本家怀里，同他们打得火热，公开鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，叫嚷资本家“剥削有功”，美化资产阶级，疯狂镇压工人阶级。天津市广大革命群众在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，集中对刘少奇当年的《天津讲话》展开了大批判，掀起了波澜壮阔的革命大批判新高潮。从工厂到郊区人民公社，从部队营房到学校，从机关到商店，全部办起了有一百六十多万人参加的几万个毛泽东思想学习班。成千上万的革命大批判专栏，象雨后春笋般地涌现出来。广大革命群众用大量的两条路线斗争的历史事实，愤怒声讨刘少奇的反革命滔天罪行，批判刘少奇的反动谬论，肃清刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义毒素。革命群众愤慨地指出，刘少奇的《天津讲话》，是一个地地道道的背叛无产阶级专政的黑纲领，是阴谋复辟资本主义的黑宣言书。
    天津第三毛纺织厂（原东亚毛麻纺织厂）的广大革命职工，用自己的亲身经历和大量铁的事实，批判了刘少奇的反动透顶的“剥削有功”谬论。工人们说，当年被刘少奇肉麻地吹捧为“文明”“进步”的大吸血鬼宋棐卿，一九三七年获得纯利一亿七千二百多万元，而这一年全年的工人的工资只有一千一百多万元；宋棐卿刚建东亚毛麻纺织厂时只有资本二十三万元，到一九四八年就达到一百五十亿元。宋棐卿资本的增加，就是残酷压榨工人的一本剥削账，就是工人养活资本家、资本家靠榨取工人血汗发财致富的铁证。全厂革命职工以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和八届扩大的十二中全会公报为武器，在一百多个班组到处摆下了革命大批判的战场，对刘少奇的“剥削有功”谬论展开了彻底的大清算。
    在曾经被刘少奇吹捧为“红色资本家”标杆的王光英把持多年的红卫化工厂（原近代化工厂），工人们用活生生、血淋淋的事实，控诉了刘少奇和王光英串通一气，镇压工人阶级的滔天罪行。王光英这个一贯行贿、偷税、盗窃国家资财的反动资本家，在党内头号走资派刘少奇的扶植下，先后窃取了全国工商联常委、全国人民代表大会代表等三十六个职位。反动资本家王光英在工厂里网罗一批牛鬼蛇神掌握大权，就连“工会主席”也安插了一个资本家。老工人们愤怒地控诉说，大工贼刘少奇和反动资本家王光英穿的是一条连裆裤。王光英为了牟取暴利，竟在没有任何安全设备的情况下强行叫工人生产易燃爆炸品硝化棉，一九五四年发生了震惊全国的“硝化棉爆炸事件”，造成十三名工人死伤。事后，王光英竟被叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇包庇袒护下来。刽子手王光英十几年来一直逍遥法外，直到这次无产阶级文化大革命中才清算了他的罪行。工人们说，刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“剥削有功”就是掩护资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的烟幕弹，就是妄想让资本家重新骑在工人头上的黑纲领。刘少奇这个大坏蛋，是资本家的奴才，是工人阶级的死敌。目前，这个厂的广大工人正结合革命大批判深入开展清理阶级队伍的工作，深挖狠批被反动资本家王光英安插下来的叛徒、反动资本家、反革命分子等一小撮阶级敌人。
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会的报告中教导我们：“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”，而大工贼刘少奇却在《天津讲话》中明目张胆地主张依靠资产阶级。天津碱厂的革命工人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，揭发、批判了刘少奇解放初期在这个厂依靠资本家、疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。一九四九年，天津碱厂的前身永利碱厂的反动资本家强迫工人减薪，无理解雇工人。当时，工人们奋起同资本家作斗争，包围了资本家的办公室和宿舍。正在工人们取得节节胜利的时刻，刘少奇在一九四九年五月突然来到永利碱厂，同反动资本家握手言欢，合影留念，并且明目张胆地鼓动资本家说：“你们有三权，即财政支配权，行政管理权，人员使用权。”“为了生产上的需要，资方得有雇用或解雇工人的自由。”刘少奇把权给了资本家，资本家就杀气腾腾地说：“豁出一锅烧碱，把这帮穷小子的骨头都烧酥它。”就这样，资本家一连解雇了八十三名工人。工人们上告到人民法院，但在刘少奇的包庇袒护下，资本家竟打赢了“官司”。天津碱厂的工人在无产阶级文化大革命中才明白了这是大工贼刘少奇搞的鬼。工人们说，掏干了海河水，也写不完工人阶级对刘少奇的仇和恨，也控诉不完刘少奇的滔天罪恶。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”天津工人阶级和广大革命群众在各级革命委员会的领导下，重新学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，学习了毛主席的最新指示，学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论，回顾了党内两条路线斗争的历史，特别是两年多来无产阶级文化大革命斗争的历史，更激发了对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱，对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的无比仇恨，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大革命群众决心结合对刘少奇《天津讲话》的革命大批判，更加深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
