	50 million revolutionary people of Henan have responded to the great battle call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In cities and countryside, battlefields are set up everywhere to severely criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 14th: The 50 million revolutionary people of Henan Province have launched a wave of learning, propagating, and implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They have responded to the great battle call issued by the plenary session, continuing to expose, criticize, accuse, and settle accounts with the traitor, internal spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi, thus powerfully promoting the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Henan Province regarded the learning, propagating, and implementing of the various battle tasks proposed in the communiqué as the top political priority. With the most enthusiastic revolutionary spirit and the fastest speed, they used various forms to spread the communiqué among the broad revolutionary masses. Various places held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with learning the communiqué as the center. Revolutionary committees at all levels organized large propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, schools, and streets to propagate the communiqué. The revolutionary committee of Lingbao County rushed to print 100,000 copies of the communiqué overnight and sent them to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolutionary committee of Xiangcheng County organized a propaganda army of more than 30,000 people to spread the communiqué throughout the entire county's 3,800-plus production teams in one day.

	The broad revolutionary masses set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere in factories, mines, steel furnaces, fields, ditches, and water conservancy projects. They used the communiqué as a weapon to expose, criticize, accuse, and settle accounts with the traitor, internal spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Henan who had madly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in Mianchi County and the Zhugou area of Xuchang County severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's traitor philosophy and class capitulationism, settling accounts with the heinous crimes of this old counter-revolutionary. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Qiliqing Commune in Xinxiang County said, "In 1958, during the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, our great leader Chairman Mao came to our commune for an inspection. He chatted warmly with our commune members and walked several miles in the scorching sun to the fields to see the cotton, issuing the great call of 'People's Communes are good.' Chairman Mao truly has a heart-to-heart connection with us poor and lower-middle peasants. This Liu Shaoqi, when he came to Xinxiang for a year, didn't even get off the train. Those who went to see him had to wash their hands and disinfect themselves first. In his eyes, there were no poor and lower-middle peasants. He is a genuine agent of the Kuomintang reactionaries." The broad revolutionary workers of Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 3 severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as 'production first,' saying, "We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and defend the proletarian mountains and rivers from changing color." The broad masses of workers and peasants, the more they expose and criticize, the more they hate Liu Shaoqi and the more they love Chairman Mao. They said, "The decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever is fully supported by us revolutionary people!"

	The high tide of revolutionary criticism is powerfully promoting the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the province. Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'the working class must lead everything' has greatly inspired the political enthusiasm of the working class in Henan. Propaganda teams composed of a large number of outstanding industrial workers, in cooperation with the People's Liberation Army, have occupied various fields of the superstructure, leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in an all-around way according to Chairman Mao's teachings, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　河南五千万人民响应全会的伟大战斗号召
　　城乡处处摆战场　狠批叛徒刘少奇
    据新华社郑州十四日电  河南省五千万革命人民对党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报掀起了学习、宣传、落实的热潮。他们响应全会发出的伟大战斗号召，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇继续展开大揭发、大批判、大控诉、大清算，有力地推动着斗、批、改的深入发展。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表以后，河南省各级革命委员会把学习、宣传、落实全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，当作最大的政治，以最饱满的革命热情，最快的速度，通过各种形式，把公报传到广大革命群众中去。各地普遍举办了以学习全会公报为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，各级革命委员会组织大批宣传队，深入工厂、农村、学校、街道宣传公报。灵宝县革委会把全会公报连夜赶印十万份，送到每户贫下中农家里。项城县革委会组织了三万多人的宣传大军，一天之内跑遍全县三千八百多个生产队进行宣传。
    广大革命群众在工厂、矿山、炼钢炉旁，在田间、地头、水利工地，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，以全会公报为武器，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在河南代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行展开了大揭发、大批判、大控诉、大清算。渑池县和确山县竹沟地区的广大贫下中农，狠批刘少奇的叛徒哲学和阶级投降主义，清算刘少奇这个老反革命的滔天罪行。新乡县七里营公社的贫下中农说，一九五八年，在大跃进的高潮中，我们伟大领袖毛主席来到俺公社视察，他老人家同咱社员亲切地拉家常，又冒着大热天步行好几里路到地里看棉花，并且发出“人民公社好”的伟大号召，毛主席真是和俺贫下中农心连心。刘少奇这个坏家伙，有一年来到新乡，连火车也不下，去见的人，还得先洗手消毒，在他眼里根本没有咱贫下中农，他是地地道道的国民党反动派的代理人。郑州国棉三厂广大革命职工狠批刘少奇的“生产第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，他们说，我们就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，保卫无产阶级的江山永不变色。广大工农群众，越揭越批对刘少奇越恨，对毛主席越亲。他们说，党的八届扩大的十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，我们革命人民一千个拥护，一万个赞成！
    革命大批判的高潮，正有力地推动着全省范围的斗、批、改深入发展。毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，极大地鼓舞了河南工人阶级的政治热情，由大批优秀的产业工人组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，在人民解放军的配合下，占领上层建筑的各个领域，领导广大革命群众，遵照毛主席的教导，全面地进行斗、批、改，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
