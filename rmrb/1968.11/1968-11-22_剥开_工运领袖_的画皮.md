Retired workers and employees of Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill who participated in the "May 30th" struggle are outraged, denouncing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi for betraying the fundamental interests of the working class and sabotaging the "May 30th" movement.

The old workers, though aged, have fiery hearts and high spirits. Their speeches are like heavy artillery shells bombarding Liu Shaoqi, like sharp daggers layer by layer peeling off Liu Shaoqi's disguise, revealing his true nature as a traitor, spy, and labor traitor.

The 70-year-old worker Zhou Gaosheng was the first to stand up and say: "Although I have retired, I will not let Liu Shaoqi, this labor traitor, off the hook. I will use ironclad historical facts to thoroughly criticize and denounce him! The scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has always claimed to be the 'leader of the labor movement.' Pfft! It's like a hanged man putting on makeup, shameless! I participated in the 'May 30th' movement. At that time, under the leadership of the Party, we workers fought against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and engaged in resolute struggles with heavily armed class enemies. Many of our class brothers sacrificed their lives for the revolution. Comrade Gu Zhenghong was killed by Japanese imperialism. We workers did not retreat in the face of counter-revolutionary violence; we fought resolutely and maintained a strike for over three months. However, Liu Shaoqi, who had usurped the leadership of the Shanghai General Labor Union, was already trembling with fear, kneeling before imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and betraying us workers. Later, he even used the excuse of 'illness' to sneak away to Changsha. We workers fought bravely against the enemy, risking our lives, while he, to save his own skin, left without a trace. Is there such a 'leader of the labor movement' in the world! Liu Shaoqi has always been our class enemy, a thorough and through counter-revolutionary!"

As Zhou Gaosheng's words fell, the retired worker Huang Guisheng stood up abruptly. He had experienced the "May 30th" struggle and was wounded during the Shanghai workers' three armed uprisings. He angrily said: "During the 'May 30th' movement, we established unions to organize workers and fight against imperialism. Imperialism and domestic reactionaries were very afraid and did everything they could to sabotage the unions. Liu Shaoqi, who was the leader of the Shanghai General Labor Union on the surface, secretly acted as a running dog for imperialism and domestic reactionaries, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities to dismantle the unions. It was this traitor, spy, and labor traitor Liu Shaoqi who told us workers to abandon the condition of 'recognizing the union' for resuming work, saying that this demand was 'too harsh.' He used his authority to remove this condition. After resuming work, we workers, regardless of whether the enemy recognized it or not, continued to establish unions in various factories. It is clear that Liu Shaoqi is a thorough and through labor traitor. Down with the labor traitor Liu Shaoqi!"

Zhou Gaosheng stood up again, furious, and said: During the continuous strike of over a hundred days, our workers' lives were extremely difficult, often unable to even lift the pot lid. But Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, secretly schemed and did not distribute the several million yuan donated by patriotic compatriots to support the striking workers, but respectfully handed it over to the big comprador Yu Qiaozhong to 'manage.' Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, wanted to use this treacherous method to force us workers to surrender. Look at this guy, isn't he evil?!

The old worker Lu Sibao stood up with tears in her eyes, denouncing and criticizing. She said: Why did the blood of our workers flow on Nanjing Road and inside Suzhou Creek in those days? Why were our class brothers arrested and killed? This was the result of imperialist persecution and Liu Shaoqi's betrayal! During the strike, Liu Shaoqi, this labor traitor, even used the excuse of distributing living expenses to workers to provide the imperialists and domestic reactionaries with a list of striking workers. Because of his betrayal, many workers were expelled and arrested. Liu Shaoqi, this heinous criminal, has truly harmed us workers enough. After liberation, the labor traitor Liu Shaoqi plotted to seize the Party, the government, and the military, attempting to restore capitalism and make us workers suffer again. This is a pipe dream! We must thoroughly criticize and settle accounts with the traitorous crimes of Liu Shaoqi, one by one!

Suddenly, the venue erupted with a chorus of angry slogans:

"Down with the labor traitor Liu Shaoqi!"
"Thoroughly settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi's treacherous crimes of betraying the Party and the nation!"

The old worker Xu Ajing was very angry and said: Liu Shaoqi is clearly a labor traitor, but he still wants to pretend to be a 'saint,' hypocritically 'caring' for us workers, saying, "Since the strike, workers have suffered greatly," so "before we resume work, we must put forward some demands, asking them to give us some subsidies or other conditions." Nonsense! We fought against imperialism and the big bourgeoisie at that time to struggle for the political rights of the working class and for the liberation of the entire nation. Comrade Gu Zhenghong said before his martyrdom: "We must unite the 400 million compatriots to carry out the revolutionary struggle." This was the common will of millions of revolutionary martyrs and workers who fought bravely at that time, but the labor traitor Liu Shaoqi used all kinds of tricks to change our political struggle into a struggle for "some subsidies," leading us down the wrong path of economism, fundamentally sabotaging the "May 30th" anti-imperialist movement.

The old worker Lu Sanjie could not suppress her anger and said: Liu Shaoqi betrayed the workers and sabotaged the "May 30th" movement, and deserves to die a thousand times! Liu Shaoqi not only secretly betrayed us workers but also publicly slandered, saying that the enemy shot and injured workers because we workers did not "maintain order," and told us workers not to "use force against" the imperialists and domestic reactionaries who used counter-revolutionary armed forces to suppress the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent act of one class overthrowing another." But Liu Shaoqi wanted us to maintain "order." Maintain what "order"? It is clear that he wanted us workers to submit to the brutal oppression of imperialism, to be cattle and horses, not to resist, not to struggle. We did not maintain his "order" and rose up to struggle, and he was scared to death and hated it to death. Imperialism used guns and cannons to suppress us workers, so why can't we use force to counter them? At that time, Gu Zhenghong took a shuttle rod to fight against the enemy. Liu Shaoqi was so afraid of using force to counter, isn't this the true face of a labor traitor!

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao led the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country to expose Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and labor traitor, and expel him from the Party forever, which is great!

The deep class hatred, like a blazing fire, burns in the heart of every worker. They said furiously: Liu Shaoqi, this labor traitor, is our class enemy who we will never reconcile with. His heinous crimes must be settled one by one, and we will not stand down until we thoroughly criticize and denounce him!

    剥开“工运领袖”的画皮
    上海国棉二厂革委会政宣组
    上海国棉二厂曾参加“五卅”斗争的退休老工人和职工群众，群情激愤，控诉和批判刘少奇出卖工人阶级的根本利益，破坏“五卅”运动的滔天罪行。
    老工人人老心红斗志昂，他们的发言象一颗颗重磅炮弹猛轰刘少奇，象一把把锋利的匕首层层剥开刘少奇的画皮，还其大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的本来面目。
    七十多岁的老工人周高升第一个站起来说：“我虽然已经退休了，但我决不放过刘少奇这个大工贼，要用铁一样的历史事实把他彻底批倒批臭！大坏蛋刘少奇一直标榜自己是‘工人运动的领袖’。呸！真是吊死鬼搽粉，死不要脸！我参加过‘五卅’运动。那时候，我们工人在党的领导下，大造帝国主义、国内反动派的反，同武装到牙齿的阶级敌人进行坚决斗争，不少阶级兄弟为革命献出了生命。顾正红烈士就是被日本帝国主义杀害的。我们工人在反革命暴力面前，毫不退缩，坚决斗争，大罢工坚持三个多月。但是，当时窃据了上海总工会领导职务的大工贼刘少奇，早已吓得双脚索索抖，跪倒在帝国主义、国内反动派的脚下，出卖了我们工人。后来，他竟借口养‘病’偷偷地溜到长沙去了。我们工人拚死地同敌人作英勇斗争，他却为了保住一条狗命，拍拍屁股逃之夭夭，天下有这样的‘工人运动领袖’吗！刘少奇从来就是我们工人阶级的死对头，是个道道地地的老反革命！”
    周高升的话音刚落，退休老工人黄桂升霍地站起来。他曾经经历过“五卅”斗争，在上海工人三次武装起义时还光荣地负过伤。他愤怒地说：“在‘五卅’运动的时候，我们办工会，是为着把我们工人组织起来，向帝国主义进行斗争。帝国主义、国内反动派十分害怕，千方百计破坏工会。刘少奇表面上是上海总工会的负责人，暗地里却充当了帝国主义、国内反动派的走狗，干着瓦解工会的反革命勾当。就是这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，要我们工人放弃‘承认工会’的复工条件，说这种要求‘厉害了’。他利用职权把这一个条件去掉了。复工以后，我们工人不管敌人承认不承认，各厂还是照样办工会。很清楚，刘少奇是个十十足足的大工贼。打倒大工贼刘少奇！”
    周高升再一次站起来怒不可遏地说：当时在连续一百多天的大罢工期间，我们工人的生活非常艰苦，时常连锅盖也揭不开。但刘少奇这个大坏蛋，却暗中捣鬼，把爱国同胞支援罢工工人的几百万元钱，不发给我们工人，却恭恭敬敬地交给大买办虞洽卿去“保管”。刘少奇这个大坏蛋是想用这种阴险手段，迫使我们工人屈服。你看这个家伙恶不恶？！
    老工人鲁四宝含着眼泪站起来控诉和批判。她说：当年南京路上，苏州河内，为什么流着我们工人的血水？我们的阶级兄弟为什么被抓进牢房，惨遭杀害？这都是帝国主义的迫害和大工贼刘少奇叛卖的结果！我们工人在罢工时，刘少奇这个大工贼竟借口为了做好工人生活费的发放工作，向帝国主义和国内反动派开了罢工工人的黑名单。由于他的出卖，大批工人被开除、逮捕。刘少奇这个十恶不赦的家伙把我们工人真是害得够苦了。解放以后，大工贼刘少奇阴谋篡党、篡政、篡军，大搞资本主义复辟，妄想要我们工人再吃二遍苦。这是白日做梦！我们一定要把大工贼刘少奇的叛党叛国罪行，件件桩桩，彻底批判，彻底清算！
    顿时，会场上响起一片愤怒的口号声：
  “打倒大工贼刘少奇！”“彻底清算刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行！”
    老工人徐阿炳非常气愤地说：刘少奇明明是个大工贼，但他还要贼骨头装“圣人”，假惺惺地“关心”我们工人，他说“罢工以来，工人是痛苦极了”，“所以我们在开工以前，必须向他们提出一点要求，叫他们发给我们一点补助费或者其他条件”。放他的狗屁！我们当年造帝国主义的反，造大资产阶级的反，是为了争取工人阶级的政治权利，是为了全国同胞的翻身求解放。顾正红烈士临牺牲时说了这么一句话：“要团结四万万同胞，进行革命斗争”。这是千万个革命先烈和当时英勇战斗的工人的共同意志，而大工贼刘少奇却耍尽阴谋，要把我们的政治斗争改变为争取“一点补助费”的斗争，引到经济主义的邪路上去，从根本上破坏“五卅”反帝运动。
    老工人鲁三妹抑制不住内心的愤怒，她说：刘少奇出卖工人，破坏“五卅”运动，罪该万死！刘少奇不但暗中出卖我们工人，还公开诬蔑说，敌人所以开枪打死打伤工人是因为我们工人未能将“秩序办好”，并且要我们工人对于用反革命武装镇压革命人民的帝国主义和国内反动派“不能用武力对付”。毛主席教导我们说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”而刘少奇却要我们守“秩序”。守什么“秩序”？很清楚，他就是要我们工人听任帝国主义的残酷压迫，做牛当马，不反抗，不斗争。我们不守他的“秩序”，起来斗争了，他就怕得要死，恨得要命。帝国主义用枪炮镇压我们工人，我们为什么不能用武力对付？当时，顾正红就是拿了一根打梭棒同敌人作斗争。刘少奇这样害怕用武力对付，不是道道地地的大工贼嘴脸又是什么！在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导全国亿万革命人民，把刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼揪出来，把他永远开除出党，就是好！
    阶级的深仇大恨，象一团烈火，在每个工人的心头燃烧。他们怒不可遏地说：刘少奇这个大工贼是我们工人阶级不共戴天的仇敌，他的滔天罪行要一笔一笔地彻底清算，不把他彻底批倒批臭，我们决不收兵！
