Chinese Ambassador to Albania Li Tingcan held a reception on the evening of the 22nd at the embassy to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Albania.

Albanian government officials Nesti Nasi, Kicho Ngela, and other officials from the Albanian People's Army and related departments were invited to attend the reception.

Li Tingcan, the acting ambassador, and Albanian Foreign Minister Nasi both spoke at the reception.

Li Tingcan, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania over the past 19 years. He said that the fraternal Albanian people warmly welcomed and highly praised the victory of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was a great encouragement and strong support for the Chinese people.

Li Tingcan said that under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have held high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, insisted on the dictatorship of the proletariat, followed Hoxha's teaching of "building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun," and achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Albanian Party of Labor's revolutionary movement to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism has achieved one great victory after another, with profound socialist revolutionary significance.

Li Tingcan said that under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor headed by its great leader Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have always held high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, with a lofty proletarian internationalist spirit, firmly supporting the struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world, fully playing the role of a strong shock brigade of the international proletariat and the revolutionary people of the world, and winning the high praise and boundless admiration of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Nasi, in his speech, said that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong and the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Enver Hoxha, our two peoples have been united as steel, advancing together on the glorious road of socialism and revolution. The fraternal Sino-Albanian friendship has been tempered and consolidated in the struggle for the cause of socialism, for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and against American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.

Nasi enthusiastically praised and highly valued the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He pointed out that this victory was confirmed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This plenary session announced the complete bankruptcy of the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi and condemned the "February Countercurrent" of 1967. He said that the Albanian people, the Albanian Party of Labor, and the Albanian government sincerely congratulate the glorious Communist Party of China and the heroic Chinese people on this great historical victory and wish them new and even greater achievements in the Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

He said that the magnificent victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a fatal blow to the counter-revolutionary alliance of the Soviet-American imperialists aimed at People's China, and a very heavy blow to the great conspiracy of these two imperialist powers to harm the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries. It is a great victory for all Marxist-Leninist revolutionary forces and a great encouragement to all the peoples of the world who are fighting against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionist clique for freedom and national independence.

Nasi said that under the leadership of Mao Zedong and Hoxha, the two parties are waging an unyielding, consistent, and uncompromising struggle against the contemporary reactionary forces of American imperialism and the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique, which has decisive significance for the fate of Marxism-Leninism, the revolutionary cause, and socialism, and for the fate of the peoples of the world.

He said that we feel very fortunate and proud that our two countries, peoples, and parties, with their steel-like friendship and unity, are at the forefront of this struggle, making their own historical contributions to the great revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world. In a telegram dated September 17, Mao Zedong Chairman and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai solemnly declared: "If the American imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." This is a great encouragement to the Albanian people and their party in this struggle.

    李庭荃临时代办说阿人民是国际无产阶级和世界革命人民的坚强突击队
    纳赛外长热烈赞扬和高度评价中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃，二十二日晚在使馆举行招待会，热烈庆祝中阿建立外交关系十九周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府有关部门负责人奈斯蒂·纳赛、基乔·恩杰拉以及阿尔巴尼亚人民军和其他有关方面负责人应邀出席了招待会。
    李庭荃临时代办和阿尔巴尼亚外交部长纳赛先后在招待会上讲了话。
    李庭荃在讲话中热烈赞扬十九年来中阿两党、两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结的巩固和发展。他说，兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢呼和高度评价中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的胜利，这是对中国人民的巨大鼓舞和有力支持。
    李庭荃说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，高举马克思列宁主义红旗，坚持无产阶级专政，遵照霍查同志“一手拿镐，一手拿枪建设社会主义”的教导，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟而开展的具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    李庭荃说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以其伟大领袖霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，一贯高举反帝反修的革命大旗，以崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，一贯坚决支持世界各国人民的斗争，充分发挥了国际无产阶级和世界革命人民的坚强突击队的作用，赢得了中国人民和全世界人民的高度赞扬和无限钦佩。
    纳赛在讲话中说，在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，我们两国人民钢铁般地团结在一起，在社会主义和革命的光荣道路上永远迈进。兄弟般的阿中友谊在为社会主义事业、为马克思列宁主义的胜利，在反对美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义斗争的烈火中得到了锤炼和巩固。
    纳赛热烈赞扬和高度评价中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。他指出，这一胜利得到了中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的确认。这次全会宣告了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部的彻底破产，谴责了一九六七年的“二月逆流”。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府衷心祝贺光荣的中国共产党和英雄的中国人民所取得的这一伟大的历史性的胜利，祝愿他们在由伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中取得新的更加巨大的成就。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的宏伟胜利，是对矛头指向人民中国的苏美反革命联盟的致命的打击，是对这两个帝国主义大国危害各国人民自由和独立的大阴谋的一个非常沉重的打击。它是一切马克思列宁主义的革命力量以及正在为反对以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义、为争取自由和民族独立而斗争的全世界各国人民的伟大胜利和对他们的巨大鼓舞。
    纳赛说，在毛泽东同志和霍查同志领导下，我们两党正在进行的反对当代的反动势力美帝和勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团的不屈不挠的、始终如一的和毫不妥协的斗争，对马克思列宁主义、革命事业和社会主义的命运，对全世界人民的命运具有决定性的意义。
    他说，我们感到十分幸运和自豪的是，有着钢铁般友谊和团结的我们两国、两国人民和两党站在这一斗争的第一线，在各国人民的伟大的革命事业中作出自己的历史性贡献。毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来同志九月十七日在给霍查同志和谢胡同志的电报中庄严声明：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”这是对阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的党在这场斗争中的十分巨大的鼓舞。
