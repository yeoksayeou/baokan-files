The medical and propaganda team of the 3016 unit of the People's Liberation Army, stationed at the Liaoyuan City School for the Deaf-Mute, has relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to break through the "forbidden zone" of the deaf-mute. This is a scene of the propaganda team's soldiers and deaf-mute students happily viewing the album "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts."
