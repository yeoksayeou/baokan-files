The East is red, the sun is rising, good news is spreading with the wind for thousands of miles, and the masses sing joyfully, shaking the clouds. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by our great leader Chairman Mao, has been published. We rejoice and sing with all our hearts. We celebrate the brilliant victory of the Cultural Revolution and sing the praises of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China founded by Chairman Mao. We wish our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by Chairman Mao, records the magnificent chapter of the first great proletarian cultural revolution in human history!

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by Chairman Mao, illuminates our course to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

The plenary session communiqué, from a political standpoint, has pronounced the death sentence on the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices!

The communiqué expresses the wishes of hundreds of millions of people and speaks the words in our hearts. We most enthusiastically support the communiqué and all its resolutions, and resolutely support the expulsion of Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and the revocation of all his positions inside and outside the Party, thoroughly exposing his heinous crimes.

Resolutely overthrow the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi!

We will most resolutely carry out the communiqué, most enthusiastically propagate the communiqué, and most bravely defend the spirit of the communiqué.

The communiqué points out, “Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao’s important instructions in various periods of the Cultural Revolution, and Vice Chairman Lin’s many speeches are all correct.” Looking back on the victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our region over the past two years, each one shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. With Chairman Mao’s leadership, we have clear minds, steady steps, and the courage to sweep away demons. We have finally smashed the bourgeois headquarters, represented by Liu Shaoqi, that attempted to usurp the Party, the government, and the military, and we have exposed this big villain and his agents in Guangxi, such as He Ximing and Xie Wangang, seizing back the power they had usurped. In the extremely complex and sharp class struggle, at every critical moment when the two lines were engaged in a life-and-death struggle, Chairman Mao gave us timely and extremely wise instructions, guiding us through the storms and preventing us from losing our way or deviating, and shattering the class enemy’s various plots of sabotage. We will never forget that when a handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies within the Party, together with the ghosts and snakes in society, were frantically sabotaging the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on his inspection of North China, Central China, East China, and other places came to us. The working class took the lead, overcoming various interferences, and achieved the revolutionary great alliance, pushing the Cultural Revolution in our region forward like a surging tide. When the class enemy incited the masses to fight each other, attempting to confuse the class lines and shift the direction of the struggle, spreading wave after wave of evil winds, our great leader Chairman Mao personally approved the “Decision of the Central Committee on the Guangxi Question” and two other important documents, pointing out the direction for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi, giving the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people boundless strength, and once again repelling the class enemy’s rampant attacks, further developing the excellent situation in Guangxi.

Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, all our brilliant victories are due to our great leader Chairman Mao! The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi vividly proves Chairman Mao’s great teaching: This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism. The struggle over the past two years has been a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership. Now, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in our region have been knocked down by us, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has never been as consolidated as it is today.

“The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous.” The communiqué of great historical significance conveys the battle cry of our great leader Chairman Mao, giving us a glorious and arduous historical mission. The working class and the broad revolutionary masses are determined to complete all the tasks set forth in the communiqué. We will definitely further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions. We will definitely fully implement Chairman Mao’s latest series of instructions, following each one. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The working class must lead everything.” Following Chairman Mao’s teaching, the working class, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, strides forward onto the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure. We are determined to occupy all positions in the superstructure with Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the proletarian educational revolution, and fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will continue to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the country, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promoted, and eliminate their counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology in all domains.

Our region is on the front line of aiding Vietnam and resisting America. We will further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao’s great policy of “grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war,” continue to do a good job of supporting the military and loving the people, and support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against America to the end. We will always maintain a hundredfold vigilance. No matter whether the enemy comes from the sky, the ground, or the sea, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate it.

    紧跟毛主席从胜利走向胜利
    广西壮族自治区革委会常委、南宁化工厂工人　蒋运英
    东方红，太阳升，喜讯随风传万里，万众欢歌震云天。伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。我们纵情欢呼，放声歌唱。欢呼文化大革命的辉煌胜利，歌唱毛主席缔造的伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席亲自主持的十二中全会公报，记载了人类历史上第一次文化大革命的壮丽篇章！
    毛主席亲自主持的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报，照亮了我们夺取文化大革命全面胜利的航程！
    全会公报，从政治上宣判了党内头号走资派、叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙的死刑！
    公报表达了亿万人民的心愿，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。我们最热烈地拥护公报和各项决议，坚决拥护把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，彻底清算他的滔天罪行。
    坚决打倒党内头号走资派、叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！
    我们最坚决地执行公报，最热情地宣传公报，最勇敢地捍卫公报精神。
    公报指出，“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署，毛主席在文化大革命中各个时期的一系列重要指示，林副主席的多次讲话，都是正确的。”回顾我区两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的每一胜利，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。有了毛主席的领导，我们心明眼亮脚跟稳，横扫妖魔胆气豪，终于摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级司令部，并把这个大坏蛋及其在广西的代理人贺希明、谢王岗之流揪了出来，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力。在极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级斗争中，在两条路线进行生死搏斗的每一个关键时刻，毛主席都及时地给了我们无比英明的指示，使我们在险风恶浪中不迷航，不转向，粉碎了阶级敌人的各种破坏阴谋。我们永远记得，当党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，疯狂地破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合的时候，传来了伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南、华东等地的一系列最新指示，我们工人阶级一马当先，排除各种干扰，带头实现了革命的大联合，推动了我区文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。当阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众，妄图混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争大方向，刮起阵阵妖风的时候，伟大领袖毛主席亲自批示了“中央关于广西问题的决定”等三个重要文件，指出了广西无产阶级文化大革命前进的方向，给无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民群众以无穷无尽的力量，又一次击溃了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，进一步发展了广西的大好形势。
    千胜利，万胜利，我们的一切辉煌胜利，都归功于伟大领袖毛主席！广西无产阶级文化大革命的实践，无比生动地证明了毛主席的伟大教导：这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。两年多来的斗争，就是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争。现在，党内头号走资派刘少奇及其在我区的代理人，已被我们打翻在地，无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。
    “中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”具有伟大历史意义的公报，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号令，给我们提出了艰巨光荣的历史使命。我们工人阶级和广大革命群众，决心完成公报中提出的一切任务。我们一定进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，我们一定全面落实，条条照办。毛主席教导我们说：“工人阶级必须领导一切”。遵照毛主席的这一教导，我们工人阶级满怀革命豪情，昂首阔步地登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台。我们决心用毛泽东思想占领上层建筑领域的一切阵地，搞好无产阶级教育革命，打好斗、批、改这一仗。我们要继续高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底清算工人阶级的死对头刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行，彻底批判他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线，并肃清他在各个领域的反革命修正主义思想。
    我区地处援越抗美前哨，我们要进一步全面贯彻毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，继续做好拥军爱民的工作，支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。时刻保持百倍警惕，无论敌人从天上钻进来，从地下冒出来，从海里爬上来，都坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭掉。
