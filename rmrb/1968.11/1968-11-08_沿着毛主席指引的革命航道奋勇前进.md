The soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army have decided to fully implement the various battle orders proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, firmly grasp their rifles, and forever be good soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, the soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, while studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, were filled with deep proletarian emotions, praising the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao, and determined to study the communiqué well and earnestly implement the various great battle tasks proposed in it. They said: Following Chairman Mao is happiness, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions is victory. We must march forward bravely along the revolutionary course charted by the great helmsman Chairman Mao.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the sentries of this company have day and night guarded the great capital of our motherland, making significant contributions to the defense of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the night the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the soldiers were overwhelmed with joy and happiness. They reviewed the two years of struggle, deeply feeling that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is the latest battle order issued by Chairman Mao to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seriously studying the communiqué and fully implementing it is the best and most practical action for revolutionary soldiers to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. The entire company of soldiers quickly launched a wave of studying and implementing the communiqué.

During the process of studying and implementing the communiqué, the entire company of soldiers, filled with the joy of victory, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao, praised the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and praised the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through study, they further tempered their hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They combined their personal experiences over the past two years, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions conveyed in the plenary session communiqué: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." They also invited representatives of the capital's industrial workers who made outstanding contributions during the Cultural Revolution to the company to share the capital's working class's battle journey of moving from victory to victory under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They also held reminiscence and reflection activities, where soldiers from the old society who had deep bitterness and hatred spoke about their happiness under Chairman Mao's wise leadership. Through these series of study activities, everyone further felt how necessary and timely this political revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is, and how profound the significance of Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is. The soldiers became more excited the more they studied, and their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao grew deeper. They solemnly swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: Dear Chairman Mao, we will forever use your brilliant thoughts to guide all our actions. We are determined to fully implement the various battle orders proposed in the plenary session communiqué, follow your great strategic deployment, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

To quickly implement the plenary session communiqué in the actions of every soldier, this company set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In recent days, in the old soldiers' study class, party members' study class, and the military-civilian study class held with neighborhood residents, the soldiers reviewed the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao in leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, re-examined Chairman Mao's latest instructions in various periods, used the plenary session communiqué as a mirror, linked and compared themselves, found gaps, fought against selfishness, and further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and further raised their awareness of defending and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Soldiers participating in the military-civilian study class also brought back to the company the good experiences of the neighborhood revolutionary masses in studying and implementing the plenary session communiqué, promoting the in-depth development of the company's study activities.

The soldiers of this company also used the plenary session communiqué as a weapon to launch a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign, pushing the criticism of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi to a new high. When criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the soldiers pointed out sharply that the reactionary essence of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is to negate the dictatorship of the proletariat and to make revolutionary soldiers put down their rifles. We will not agree to this a thousand times, a million times. In the party members' study class with the participation of the masses, the soldiers angrily criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, severely criticized the "theory of joining the party to become an official" and the "theory of peace within the party," and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. The revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign further strengthened the soldiers' resolute determination to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, unanimously expressing their determination to firmly grasp their rifles and forever be good soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

    沿着毛主席指引的革命航道奋勇前进
    北京卫戍区某部三连指战员决心全面落实十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗号令，紧握手中枪，永远做无限忠于毛主席的好战士
    据新华社六日讯　人民解放军北京卫戍区某部三连指战员，在学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的热潮中，满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，决心学好公报，认真贯彻执行公报提出的各项伟大战斗任务。他们说：紧跟毛主席就是幸福，落实毛主席的指示就是胜利，我们一定要沿着伟大统帅毛主席指引的革命航道奋勇前进。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，这个连的警卫战士日夜守卫在伟大祖国的首都，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大贡献。在党的八届十二中全会公报发表的当天晚上，指战员们心似潮涌，沉浸在无比欢乐、无限幸福之中。他们回顾两年来的斗争实践，深深体会到，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，是毛主席为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而发出的最新战斗号令。在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，认真学习公报，全面落实公报，是革命战士无限忠于毛主席的最好、最实际的行动。全连指战员迅速掀起了学习、贯彻公报的热潮。
    在学习、贯彻公报的过程中，全连指战员满怀胜利的喜悦，热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，赞颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力，赞颂毛主席革命路线的无比正确，通过学习，进一步锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。他们结合两年来的亲身感受，反复学习全会公报传达的毛主席的最新指示：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”并且邀请在文化大革命中作出卓越贡献的首都产业工人代表，来连队介绍首都工人阶级在毛主席革命路线的光辉指引下从胜利走向胜利的战斗历程。他们还开展了忆苦思甜活动，由旧社会苦大仇深的战士忆苦思甜，畅谈在毛主席英明领导下的幸福。通过这一系列的学习活动，大家更加体会到毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场政治大革命是多么必要，多么及时，毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大学说具有多么深远的意义。指战员们越学越兴奋，越学对毛主席的无产阶级感情越深。他们在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：敬爱的毛主席，我们永远用您的光辉思想指导我们的一切，我们决心全面落实全会公报提出的各项战斗号令，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    为了使全会公报迅速落实到每个战士的行动中，这个连办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。连日来，在老战士学习班、党员学习班，以及同街道居民一起举办的军民学习班里，指战员们回顾伟大领袖毛主席领导无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署，重温毛主席在各个时期发出的最新指示，以全会公报为镜子，联系对照自己，找差距，斗私心，进一步加深了对毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的理解，进一步提高了捍卫和执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性。参加军民学习班的指战员，还把街道革命群众学习、贯彻全会公报的好经验带回连队，促进连队学习活动的深入开展。
    这个连的指战员还以全会公报为武器展开了革命大批判，把对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的大批判推向了新高潮。在批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”时，指战员们一针见血地指出，“阶级斗争熄灭论”的反动实质，就是否定无产阶级专政，就是要我们革命战士放下手中枪，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。在有群众参加的党员学习班里，指战员们愤怒地批判了刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线，狠批“入党做官论”、“党内和平论”，大立毛主席的无产阶级建党路线。革命大批判进一步增强了指战员们保卫无产阶级专政的坚强决心，一致表示要紧握手中枪，永远做无限忠于毛主席的好战士。
