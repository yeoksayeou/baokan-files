The leader of the Beijing Radio and Television Institute's Capital Workers and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Comrade Wang Pan Dong, was an ordinary worker before the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, he was elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee of a certain unit in Beijing. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that "the working class must lead everything," he led a group of outstanding workers to enter the Beijing Radio and Television Institute.

Wang Pan Dong's status has changed, his duties have increased, but the essence of the working class has not changed.

Arming the Mind with Mao Zedong Thought

After taking on the role of team leader, Wang Pan Dong repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." He firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, cautious, modest, and unhurried attitude, and continue to maintain a spirit of hard work and self-reliance." He worked even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In addition to insisting on daily study and half-day study sessions, he carried the Little Red Book with him everywhere, studying with revolutionary teachers and students wherever he went, and engaging in self-criticism and the struggle against revisionism. No matter how busy his work was, before doing anything, he would open Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide his actions. No matter how tired he was, every night before going to sleep, he would use Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror to reflect on himself and summarize his day's work. If it aligned with Mao Zedong Thought, he would continue; if it did not, he would resolutely correct it. One night, a comrade who lived with him woke up and saw him still studying Chairman Mao's works. The comrade said, "Old Wang, you always go to bed late and get up early. Rest a bit." He replied, "We 'rough guys' rely on what to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure? We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If we don't study Mao Zedong Thought well, we can't complete the great tasks Chairman Mao has given us!" He then continued studying. His cultural level was very low, and he found it difficult to write, but he insisted on writing his thoughts and reflections on studying Chairman Mao's works. For words he didn't know how to write, he used symbols to replace them, like the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Gu Atiao. His writing might not be good, and his articles might not be long, but each one was filled with his limitless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Every time Chairman Mao issued a new directive, he studied it with the greatest effort, propagated it with the greatest enthusiasm, and implemented it with the fastest speed. On the night of October 15, the radio broadcasted Chairman Mao's latest directive on "expelling the old and taking in the new." He immediately organized all the propaganda team members and the entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to listen, hold nighttime parades, discuss, and implement the directive. Wang Pan Dong's noble qualities of acting swiftly and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives had a significant impact on the entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. Now, every revolutionary comrade can ensure that the latest directives are propagated without delay, studied without relaxation, and implemented without hesitation, turning Chairman Mao's every new directive into their actual actions. Revolutionary teachers and students said, "The school changes in a thousand ways, in ten thousand ways, but the greatest change is that Chairman Mao's latest directives are quickly implemented."

Not Detaching from Labor

Wang Pan Dong's status has changed, his duties have increased, but he still loves labor like an ordinary worker. He often told the workers' propaganda team members, "Some people become revisionists by detaching themselves from labor and the masses. We are all workers, laborers, and we must never forget labor after entering the school."

Wang Pan Dong practiced what he preached. When he first entered the school, due to the prolonged "internal warfare" and armed struggles between the two factions, public sanitation was neglected, and the men's and women's toilets in the teaching building were piled high with feces. After discovering this, he rolled up his sleeves, rolled up his pants, and picked up a broom to start cleaning. Inspired by him, revolutionary teachers and students also joined in, and the entire teaching building was cleaned spotless.

After Chairman Mao's latest directive on "broad cadres going down to labor, this is a great opportunity for cadres to learn anew, except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches" was issued, he, with boundless proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great teachings. No matter how busy or tired he was, he always found ways to participate in labor. In addition to insisting on participating in regular labor, he also used his Sundays to find work. On a Sunday morning, despite the rain and wind, Wang Pan Dong led the workers' propaganda team members to bravely clean up garbage and maintain environmental sanitation. The students were deeply moved and also came to work with the workers' propaganda team members. A student said, "The teachers' actions are silent commands. In the future, we will sincerely accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers and thoroughly change our old thoughts."

Heart to Heart with the Masses

Wang Pan Dong firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must not have a moment of detachment from the masses. As long as we do not detach from the masses, we will definitely be victorious." He was humble, cautious, modest, and unhurried, maintaining close contact with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. To frequently hear the voices and opinions of the masses, after entering the school, he did not live in the office building but deliberately chose a room on the first floor of the teaching building, near the staircase, which was the noisiest and most frequented by teachers and students. In the room where he lived, it was always full of teachers and students, some coming to report situations, others coming to have heart-to-heart talks. Some propaganda team members saw that he did not rest at noon every day and went to bed very late every night, so they suggested he move to a quieter office building. He firmly rejected this, saying meaningfully, "I live here close to the masses. If I move to the office building, I will be far from the masses."

Wang Pan Dong often went deep into the dormitories to have heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary teachers and students and often held various types of heart-to-heart meetings and discussions to solicit the opinions of the masses. Once, he heard a student report that a propaganda team member's work was not thorough, and he immediately convened a meeting with all the propaganda team members, leading everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. He first conducted a self-criticism and mobilized everyone to check their work and summarize their experiences. From then on, the workers' propaganda team members and the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff implemented the "five together" approach. During the "five together" process, they widely carried out heart-to-heart activities, timely grasped active thoughts, and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. They repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, turning Chairman Mao's latest directives into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

A Spirit of Hard Work and Self-Reliance

Wang Pan Dong's status has changed, his duties have increased, and he has received honors, but he did not have a special attitude. This year, during the National Day celebrations, he was selected as a representative to attend the ceremony and stayed in Zhongnanhai. The Party trusted him, and the masses supported him, with more and more praise.

In this situation, Wang Pan Dong always reminded himself of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because of victory, the emotions of arrogance, self-congratulation, stagnation, and reluctance to progress, and the desire for enjoyment and reluctance to live a hard life may grow within the Party." Wang Pan Dong recalled the bitter life of his ancestors who worked for landlords for three generations and his own life of begging with his mother. He said, "Everything I have is given to me by Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Wang Pan Dong. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, a Communist Party member has done a little work for the people, and there is nothing to be proud of. All victories belong to Chairman Mao, belong to the Party, and belong to the people."

In his life, he was frugal and simple in his clothing, food, housing, and transportation, strictly demanding of himself in every aspect. For a period, his throat was inflamed, and he could not eat hard food. Comrades suggested he make some noodles to eat, but he firmly rejected it, saying, "In the past, the capitalist roaders pretended to be sick, overreacted to minor illnesses, ate special meals, and created special conditions, seriously detaching themselves from the masses. We must remember this historical lesson, share the hardships and joys with the masses, and be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets." The school had many people, and he always went to buy food last, letting others go first. He was not in good health, but he never ate good food and often educated the propaganda team members to maintain a frugal and simple lifestyle, setting a good example of hard work and self-reliance for the revolutionary teachers and students. Wang Pan Dong always maintained the essence of the working class, appearing everywhere as an ordinary worker. The masses affectionately called him "our Teacher Wang."

    永葆工人阶级的本色
    ——记北京无线电工业学校首都工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队指挥部负责人王畔东
    首都工人、解放军驻北京无线电工业学校毛泽东思想宣传队指挥部负责人王畔东同志，文化大革命前，是一个普通的工人，文化大革命中，他被选为北京某单位革命委员会委员。伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示发表后，他又率领一批优秀的工人进驻了北京无线电工业学校。
    王畔东同志的地位变了，职务多了，但工人阶级的本色没有变。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑
    王畔东同志担任指挥部负责人以后，反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这篇光辉著作，他牢记毛主席“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，更加努力活学活用毛主席著作。他除了坚持天天读和半日制学习雷打不动外，红色宝书随身带，走到那里，就和那里的革命师生一起学习，一起斗私批修。不论工作有多忙，每做一件事情之前，他都翻开毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动；不论工作有多累，每天晚上睡觉之前，他都要用毛泽东思想当镜子，照照自己，总结一天的工作。符合毛泽东思想的就坚持下去，不符合毛泽东思想的就坚决克服。一天晚上，和他同住的一位同志一觉醒来，见他还在那里孜孜不倦地学习毛主席著作，便关心地说：“老王，你每天晚上都睡得很晚，明天还要早起，快休息吧。”他回答说：“咱们这些‘大老粗’靠什么领导上层建筑的斗、批、改，靠什么对知识分子进行再教育？靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠毛主席的一系列最新指示，靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。不好好学习毛泽东思想，就不能完成毛主席交给我们的伟大任务啊！”他说完又继续学习。他的文化水平很低，写东西十分困难，但仍坚持写学习毛主席著作的心得体会。不会写的字，就象学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃那样用符号来代替。他写的字虽然不好，文章虽然不长，但每篇文章都浸透了他对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。
    毛主席的每条最新指示发表后，他都用最大的努力去学习，最大的热情去宣传，最快的速度去贯彻。十月十五日夜，广播里传来了伟大领袖毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的最新指示，他立即组织全体宣传队员和全校广大革命师生员工收听，连夜游行庆祝，座谈讨论，宣传落实。王畔东同志对最新指示闻风而动，坚决贯彻执行的高贵品质，对全校广大革命师生员工的影响很大。现在每一个革命同志都能做到宣传最新指示不过夜，学习最新指示不放松，贯彻最新指示不迟疑，使毛主席的每一项最新指示都能迅速地变成自己的实际行动。革命师生说：“电校千变化，万变化，最大的变化是毛主席的最新指示能迅速地得到落实。”
    不脱离劳动
    王畔东同志的地位变了，职务多了，但他仍和一个普通工人一样热爱劳动。他经常对工人宣传队的同志说：“有些人变修，就是由脱离劳动、脱离群众开始的。我们都是工人，是劳动人民，千万不能进了学校忘了劳动。”
    王畔东同志说到做到。刚进学校时，由于两派长期打“内战”，搞武斗，公共卫生无人管，教学楼男女厕所里的大便纸堆成堆。王畔东同志发现以后，二话不说，卷卷袖子，挽挽裤腿，拿起一把笤帚就去打扫。在他的带动下，革命师生也去了，把整个教学楼打扫得干干净净。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的最新指示发表后，他怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，坚决执行毛主席的这一伟大教导。不管工作多忙、多累，他都想方设法挤时间参加劳动。除了坚持参加正常的劳动外，他还用星期日的时间找活干。一个星期日的早晨，天下着雨，刮着风，王畔东同志还带领工人宣传队的同志冒雨迎风紧张地清除垃圾，打扫环境卫生。同学们很受感动，也赶来和工人宣传队的同志一起干。有个同学说：“老师傅的行动是无声的命令，今后我们一定诚诚恳恳接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想。”
    和群众心连心
    王畔东同志牢记伟大领袖毛主席“我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利”的教导，谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁，和广大革命师生员工保持密切的联系。为了能够经常地听到群众的呼声、群众的意见，进校后他不住办公楼，特意找了教学楼一楼靠近楼梯的一间最不安静、师生出入频繁的房子住下。在他住的那间房子里总是师生满堂，有的找他反映情况，有的找他谈心。有的宣传队员看他每天中午都得不到休息，每天晚上又睡得很晚，就建议他搬到比较安静的办公楼去住，他坚决拒绝了，意味深长地说：“我住在这里离群众很近，搬到办公楼去住，离群众就远了。”
    王畔东同志还经常深入到宿舍，找革命师生促膝谈心，经常召开各种类型的谈心会、座谈会，征求群众的意见。有一次，他听到一个学生反映一个宣传队员工作不深入，马上召集了全体宣传队员开会，带领大家学习毛主席关于群众路线方面的教导。他首先自我检查，并发动大家检查工作，总结经验。从此，工人宣传队的同志和广大革命师生员工实行了“五同”。在“五同”过程中，广泛地开展谈心活动，及时地抓住活思想，做深入细致的思想政治工作，反复地宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示迅速变为广大革命师生员工的自觉行动，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    艰苦奋斗的作风
    王畔东同志的地位变了，职务多了，荣誉也有了，但他一点也不特殊化。今年国庆，他被推选为观礼代表，住进了中南海。党信任他，群众拥护他，赞扬声越来越多。
    在这种情况下，王畔东同志时时以毛主席的“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长”的教导警惕自己。王畔东同志回忆了旧社会祖辈三代给地主扛活，自己同母亲沿门乞讨的痛苦生活。他说：“我的一切都是毛主席给的，没有毛主席，就没有我王畔东。在毛主席领导下，一个共产党员为人民做了一点工作，没有什么值得骄傲的地方。一切胜利归功于毛主席，归功于党，归功于人民。”
    在生活上他艰苦朴素，衣、食、住、行处处严格要求自己。有一段时间，他嗓子发炎，不能吃硬食，同志们建议他做点面条吃吃，他坚决拒绝，说：“过去走资派无病呻吟，小病大养，吃小灶，搞特殊，严重脱离群众。我们一定要牢记这个历史教训，要同群众同甘共苦，警惕糖衣炮弹的袭击。”学校人多要排队买饭，他每次去得最晚，把方便让给别人。他身体不好，但从来不吃好菜，还经常教育宣传队的同志要保持艰苦朴素的生活作风，给革命师生作出艰苦奋斗的好榜样。王畔东同志时时保持工人阶级本色，处处以普通工人的身份出现，群众都亲切地称他“我们的王师傅”。
