At the invitation of General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a friendly delegation from the Pakistani armed forces arrived in Beijing today for a friendly visit. The delegation was warmly welcomed at the airport.

The delegation, led by General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Army, arrived in Beijing by special plane. The Pakistani guests were greeted warmly at the airport.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included: General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and responsible officials from the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff Department, the General Logistics Department, various military branches, and related departments, such as Xiao Jingguang, Li Tianyou, Zhang Xianyue, Wu Ruilin, Tan Jieshu, Han Nianlong, Xiang Qian, Ding Xilin, and others, as well as more than a thousand soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing militia, and Red Guards.

Today, the Chinese and Pakistani flags flew high in the sky above the capital airport. The welcoming crowd held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and President Ayub Khan of Pakistan, beating drums and gongs to warmly welcome the guests from the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan. When the guests, accompanied by General Huang Yongsheng and others, walked around the field to meet the welcoming crowd, the crowd shouted slogans such as "Warmly welcome the Pakistani armed forces friendly delegation!" "Firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression!" "Firmly support the Kashmiri people's struggle for national self-determination!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan!" "Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!" "Down with imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!"

Pakistan's Ambassador to China, Sultan M. Khan, and military attachés from some countries also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

Zhang Zhongru, Political Commissar of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, who went to Shanghai to welcome the delegation, and Pakistani military attachés Haidar Colonel and Kayyum Colonel, arrived in Beijing by the same plane.

The Pakistani armed forces friendly delegation arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They were warmly welcomed and seen off by responsible officials of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Shanghai and members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, as well as more than a thousand soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and Shanghai Red Guards.

General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Army, and the Pakistani armed forces friendly delegation he led.

At the banquet filled with the friendly atmosphere between the peoples and armies of China and Pakistan, General Huang Yongsheng and General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan both spoke.

General Huang Yongsheng said in his speech: China and Pakistan are friendly neighboring countries. In recent years, our friendly cooperative relations have been continuously developing. The friendly exchanges between our two armies have become more frequent. We believe that this visit by the delegation will certainly make new contributions to strengthening the friendship between our two peoples and our two armies.

General Huang Yongsheng praised the Pakistani people for their glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. He said: In recent years, under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, the Pakistani people have been tirelessly fighting to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression. The Pakistani people and armed forces have bravely resisted the armed attacks of the Indian reactionaries. The Pakistani people, united as one, have repeatedly foiled the external subversion and the evil plots to split East and West Pakistan. We sincerely wish the Pakistani people and armed forces new and greater victories in their just struggle to maintain national independence and defend state sovereignty.

General Huang Yongsheng pointed out: The most ferocious aggressors of the contemporary world, the U.S. imperialists and the heads of modern revisionism, are colluding to try to redivide the world. They are in cahoots, providing large quantities of weapons and "aid" to support the Indian reactionaries in repeatedly invading the territories of China and Pakistan, threatening the security of our two countries. They have done all sorts of evil and shameful deeds. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the future, the world must be a world of the people, and each country must be managed by its own people, and it cannot be a world where imperialism and its running dogs run wild again." The dirty political deals and barefaced acts of aggression by the U.S. imperialists and the heads of modern revisionism will certainly provoke even more intense resistance from the people of the world, accelerating their doom. Their days are numbered.

General Huang Yongsheng said: At present, the situation of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are closely watching with heightened vigilance the aggressive crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices around our country. If the enemy dares to impose war on us, we will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to annihilate them completely and thoroughly.

General Huang Yongsheng reiterated in his speech: The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Pakistani people's just struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression, and firmly support the Kashmiri people's just struggle for national self-determination!

General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan then spoke. He said on behalf of the delegation members and in his personal capacity, he expressed heartfelt thanks for the warm and friendly welcome we received in Shanghai and Beijing. Our visit and your enthusiasm once again embody the strong friendly relations between our two countries and the continuous development of cooperation between our two armed forces.

General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan spoke about Pakistan's efforts under the leadership of President Ayub Khan to focus on national economic development and be ready at any time to defend Pakistan's independence and territorial integrity.

General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan warmly praised the indomitable fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said as a military man, he admired the indomitable spirit shown by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in completing the epic Long March and subsequent struggles. In his speech, he thanked the Chinese people for their consistent and firm support for the Kashmiri people's just struggle for self-determination and for the aid provided to Pakistan.

He said in discussing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: We in Pakistan closely follow the glorious achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. We admire with great respect the all-round progress you have made in a short span of nineteen years, relying on self-reliance. We are very interested in the progress and achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. We wish you greater achievements in the future.

Pakistan's Ambassador to China, Sultan M. Khan, and military attachés Haidar Colonel and Kayyum Colonel, and embassy officials were also invited to attend the banquet.

Those attending the banquet included: responsible officials from the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff Department, the General Logistics Department, various military branches, and related departments, such as Xiao Jingguang, Li Tianyou, Zhang Xianyue, Wu Ruilin, Tan Jieshu, Han Nianlong, Xiang Qian, and others, as well as representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing.

Invited to attend the banquet were also military attachés from various countries' embassies in China.

Before the banquet, General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff, met with General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan and the entire delegation of the Pakistani armed forces friendly delegation, and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them.

    新华社八日讯　由巴基斯坦陆军总司令叶海亚·汗上将率领的巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国武装部队友好代表团，应中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜的邀请，前来我国进行友好访问，今天乘专机到达北京。巴基斯坦客人在机场上受到了热烈的欢迎。
    到机场欢迎的有：中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，国防部、总参谋部、总后勤部、各军种、兵种和有关方面负责人萧劲光、李天佑、张贤约、吴瑞林、谭家述、韩念龙、向前、丁西林等，以及人民解放军指战员、首都民兵和红卫兵小将一千多人。
    今天，中国国旗和巴基斯坦国旗在首都机场上空高高飘扬。欢迎的人们高举我们的伟大领袖毛主席画像，高举巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗的画像，敲锣打鼓热烈欢迎来自友好邻邦巴基斯坦的客人。当客人们在黄永胜总参谋长等陪同下，绕场一周同欢迎群众见面的时候，欢迎队伍中响起一阵阵“热烈欢迎巴基斯坦武装部队友好代表团！”“坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、反对外来侵略的斗争！”“坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决权利的斗争！”“中、巴两国人民的友谊万岁！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”等口号声。巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗，以及一些国家驻我国武官也到机场迎接。
    专程前往上海迎接的我国防部外事局政委张中如，巴基斯坦驻中国大使馆武官海达上校和卡尤姆上校，同机到达北京。
    巴基斯坦武装部队友好代表团，是昨天到达上海的。他们在抵离上海时受到了中国人民解放军驻上海部队负责人和上海市革命委员会成员，以及人民解放军指战员、上海红卫兵小将一千人的热烈迎送。
    新华社八日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎巴基斯坦陆军总司令叶海亚·汗上将和他率领的巴基斯坦武装部队友好代表团。
    在充满中巴两国人民和两国军队之间友好气氛的宴会上，黄永胜总参谋长和叶海亚·汗上将先后讲了话。
    黄永胜在讲话中说，中巴两国是友好邻邦。近几年来，我们两国的友好合作关系不断发展。我们两国军队之间的友好来往也日渐频繁。我们相信，代表团的这次访问必将为加强我们两国人民和两国军队之间的友谊作出新的贡献。
    黄永胜赞扬巴基斯坦人民具有反帝反殖的光荣传统。他说，近几年来，在阿尤布·汗总统领导下，巴基斯坦人民为维护民族独立，抵抗外来侵略进行了不懈的斗争。巴基斯坦人民和武装部队，英勇抗击了印度反动派的武装进攻。巴基斯坦人民团结一致，不断挫败了外来的颠覆和阴谋分裂东、西巴基斯坦的罪恶活动。我们衷心祝愿巴基斯坦人民和武装部队在维护民族独立、捍卫国家主权的正义斗争中，取得新的、更大的胜利。
    黄永胜指出，当代最凶恶的侵略者，美帝国主义和现代修正主义头子，正在加紧勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界。他们狼狈为奸，用大量武器装备和“经援”支持印度反动派一再侵犯中国和巴基斯坦的领土，威胁我们两国的安全。他们做尽了坏事、丑事。我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“今后的世界必须是人民的世界，世界各国必须由各国人民自己管理自己，而决不能再是帝国主义及其走狗横行霸道的世界了。”美帝国主义和现代修正主义头子的肮脏的政治交易和赤裸裸的侵略罪行，必然要激起全世界人民更激烈的反抗，加速他们的灭亡。他们被埋葬的日子不远了。
    黄永胜说，当前我国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，正以百倍的警惕，密切注视着美帝国主义及其帮凶在我国周围进行的侵略罪行。如果敌人胆敢把战争强加到我们头上，我们就一定遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之。
    黄永胜在讲话中重申，中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立反对外来侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决权利的正义斗争！
    叶海亚·汗上将接着讲话。他说，我代表代表团的成员并以我个人的名义，为我们在上海和北京所受到的热烈友好的欢迎，表示衷心的感谢。我们的这次访问和你们表现的热诚，又一次体现了我们两国之间的牢固的友好关系和我们两国武装部队之间的合作不断发展。
    叶海亚·汗在讲话中谈到了巴基斯坦人民在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，致力于国家的经济发展，并随时准备为保卫巴基斯坦的独立和领土完整进行自卫。
    叶海亚·汗上将热情赞扬中国人民解放军英勇不屈的战斗精神。他说，我作为一个军人，对中国人民解放军能够完成史诗般的长征和随后的胜利斗争所具有的不屈不挠的精神，表示钦佩。他在讲话中感谢中国人民一贯坚决支持查谟和克什米尔人民为争取自决权利的正义斗争，感谢中国人民对巴基斯坦提供的援助。
    他在谈到中国的无产阶级文化大革命时说，我们在巴基斯坦密切地注视着中国人民在他们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，所取得的辉煌成就。我们以非常敬佩的心情看到了你们在短短十九年的时间里，依靠自力更生所取得的全面进展。我们很感兴趣地注视着中国无产阶级文化大革命的进展和成就，这些胜利和成就是在毛泽东主席的英明领导下所取得的。我们祝你们今后取得更大的成就。
