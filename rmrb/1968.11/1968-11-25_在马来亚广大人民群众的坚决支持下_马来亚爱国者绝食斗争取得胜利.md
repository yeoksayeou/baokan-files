With the resolute support of the broad masses of the people of Malaya, the hunger strike of Malayan patriots has achieved victory.

New China News Agency, Singapore: According to the Malayan newspaper "Frontline News" published in Singapore, political prisoners who have been illegally detained for a long time in Singapore prisons by the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew have, with the resolute support of the broad masses of the people of Malaya, persisted in a hunger strike for more than thirty days and have achieved initial victory.

The political prisoners detained in Singapore prisons, in order to protest against the brutal persecution by the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, the running dogs of American imperialism, carried out a heroic hunger strike from October 3 to November 6, finally forcing the reactionary authorities to accept some of the political prisoners' legitimate demands.

During this period, the broad masses of the people of Malaya (including Singapore) have consistently and resolutely supported the heroic struggle of the political prisoners against persecution. The people of Singapore have held demonstrations on many occasions, distributed leaflets, and posted slogans, powerfully exposing the fascist nature of the reactionary regime.

    在马来亚广大人民群众的坚决支持下
    马来亚爱国者绝食斗争取得胜利
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：据新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》报道，被拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团长期非法关禁在新加坡监狱的政治犯，在马来亚广大人民群众的坚决支持下，坚持了三十多天的绝食斗争，已取得初步胜利。
    被关禁在新加坡监狱的政治犯为了抗议美帝国主义走狗拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团对他们的残暴迫害，从十月三日至十一月六日进行了英勇的绝食斗争，终于迫使反动当局接受政治犯提出的一些正当要求。
    在此期间，马来亚（包括新加坡）广大人民群众一直坚决支持政治犯的英勇的反迫害斗争。新加坡群众曾多次举行示威，散发传单和张贴标语，有力地揭露了反动集团的法西斯面目。
