Forestry workers and poor peasants in Shuizui Village of Puxiang Commune, Fujian Province, have united to manage primary schools, and the enthusiasm for mass-run schools has reached an unprecedented level.

In the past year, they have thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, changed the past phenomenon of schools being detached from proletarian politics, production labor, and the masses, and significantly increased the number of children of forestry workers and poor peasants enrolled in school. The cause of education has flourished.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: In March of last year, the forestry workers, poor peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students of Shuizui Village (including the Jiu Longshan Logging Site and the Liankeng and Xiekeng Production Brigades) in Puxiang Commune, Shunchang County, Fujian Province, formed an educational revolution leadership group composed of forestry workers, poor peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must be revolutionized" to manage all ten primary schools in the village, implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and bringing about profound changes in primary school education in the village.

In the past year, the enthusiasm for mass-run schools has reached an unprecedented level, and the cause of education in Shuizui Village has flourished. The enrollment rate of school-age children has reached over 95%, an increase of more than eight times compared to the past. Among the students in school, the proportion of children from forestry workers and poor peasants has increased from less than half before the management to over 90% now. In terms of school locations, it has been ensured that primary school students do not leave their production teams, and junior high school students do not leave their brigades.

For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shunchang County have vigorously promoted the revisionist educational line, excluding the vast majority of workers and poor peasants' children from school. For those workers and peasants' children who are in school, they use grades, exams, retention, and expulsion as barriers to suppress and exclude them. Even the graduates also suffer from the serious harm of the revisionist line. The broad masses of forestry workers and poor peasants are extremely angry about the revisionist educational line. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not continue" and, with the strong support of the PLA's leftist personnel, seized the school battlefield. The practice of the past year has proven that it is good for forestry workers and poor peasants to jointly manage schools. Their approach is as follows:

1. **Firmly grasp class struggle and continuously consolidate the leadership of workers and poor peasants over schools.** In the early days of managing schools, a small handful of class enemies in Shuizui Village used various treacherous means to sabotage, attempting to maintain the old educational system and allow bourgeois intellectuals to continue to dominate schools. Faced with the arrogant provocations of class enemies, the Shuizui Village educational revolution leadership group organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and educational revolution and carried out in-depth criticism of the revisionist educational line. Through firmly grasping class struggle and revolutionary criticism, they repelled the provocations of class enemies, further strengthened the unity of workers and peasants, and became more determined and confident in managing schools well. They said, "Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must unite and jointly manage schools well, thoroughly smashing the revisionist nursery."

2. **Insist on the path of political school building and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all school work.** In the past, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and other class enemies did everything they could to sabotage and obstruct the revolutionary teachers and students' study, practice, and application of Mao Zedong Thought, causing school education to severely deviate from proletarian politics. After forestry workers and poor peasants took over the management of schools, they widely carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They insisted on placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, made the study of Chairman Mao's works the most important course, and universally established systems such as morning reports, evening summaries, daily readings, and experience-sharing meetings. They also organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The school also adopted the method of "inviting in and going out," inviting forestry workers and poor peasants to the school to share their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, telling family and village histories, and conducting class education for teachers and students. At the same time, they organized teachers and students to regularly go to work areas and production brigades to study Chairman Mao's works with forestry workers and poor peasants and to hold criticism and self-criticism meetings together. Revolutionary teachers and students also organized more than ten Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate Mao Zedong Thought in work areas and production brigades, promptly conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses of forestry workers and poor peasants. The masses praised, "Now the students trained by the school are truly good. With such successors, we are at ease."

3. **Focus on learning, with a focus on other skills, cultivating laborers who are both literate and skilled, both workers and farmers.** The Shuizui Village primary school educational revolution leadership group, following Chairman Mao's great instruction that "students should also focus on learning, with a focus on other skills, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing bourgeois ideology," fully mobilized the masses to criticize the past phenomenon of schools closing their doors to teaching, deviating from proletarian politics, production labor, and the masses, and strengthened labor education for students. With the help of forestry workers and poor peasants, all primary schools in the village organized students to go to brigades for labor based on the local agricultural seasons and the brigades' need for labor, participating in collective production labor for about one-third of the year. In addition, each primary school also reclaimed some wasteland as a base for school production labor and scientific experiments. The school often invited old farmers, forestry technicians, and health workers to teach agricultural, forestry, and health knowledge. They also organized carpentry groups, bamboo craft groups, and barber groups to cultivate students' labor consciousness.

4. **Help revolutionary teachers walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, promoting the thought revolutionization of the teaching staff.** Chairman Mao taught, "The key issue in educational reform is the issue of teachers." The forestry workers and poor peasants of Shuizui Village fully realized that only by building a teaching staff that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao can they cultivate reliable successors for the cause of the proletarian revolution. Therefore, after taking over the management of schools, they regarded strengthening the thought revolutionization of the teaching staff as an important task. On the one hand, they combined the work of purging class elements in the logging site and production brigades to clean out some bad elements who had infiltrated the teaching staff. On the other hand, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation" to help teachers walk out of the school gates, go to work areas and production brigades to be "students" of forestry workers and poor peasants, and receive re-education from workers and peasants to thoroughly transform their old thoughts. In the past, some teachers were deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line and had long been detached from the workers and peasants. Now, through contact with the workers and peasants, their thoughts and feelings have undergone great changes, truly realizing that forestry workers and poor peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, have the highest class consciousness, and the firmest stance, and are their best teachers. Revolutionary teachers deeply felt, "We walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, the more we walk, the more we feel close to Chairman Mao; the more we walk, the closer our hearts are to the workers and peasants." The broad masses of forestry workers and poor peasants also said, "Teachers were strangers to us in the past, but now they are our close friends."

　　埔上公社水尾片的林业工人和贫下中农联合起来管理小学
　　群众办学的积极性空前高涨
　　一年多来，狠批了刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，改变了过去学校脱离无产阶级政治、脱离生产劳动、脱离群众的现象，林业工人、贫下中农子女入学人数大量增加，教育事业蓬勃发展
    新华社福州电　福建省顺昌县埔上公社水尾片（包括九龙山伐木场和连坑、谢坑两个生产大队）的林业工人和贫下中农，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“教育要革命”的教导，于去年三月成立了由林业工人、贫下中农和革命师生代表组成的教育革命领导小组，管理全片十所小学，贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，使全片小学教育发生了深刻的变化。
    一年多来，群众办学的积极性空前高涨，水尾片的教育事业蓬勃发展。学龄儿童的入学率达到百分之九十五以上，比过去增加八倍多。在校学生中，林业工人、贫下中农的子女，已从管理前的不到一半增加到现在的百分之九十以上。在学校的布点上做到了读初小不出生产队，读高小不出大队。
    长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在顺昌县的代理人，竭力推行修正主义教育路线，把广大工人、贫下中农子女排斥在校门之外。对在校的工农子女，则用分数、考试、留级、退学等重重关卡，加以打击、排斥。就是毕业出来的学生，也受到修正主义路线的严重毒害。广大林业工人、贫下中农对修正主义教育路线非常愤怒。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们遵循毛主席“教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的教导，在解放军支左人员的大力支持下，占领了学校阵地。一年多来的实践证明，林业工人、贫下中农联合起来管理学校就是好。他们的做法是：
    一、狠抓阶级斗争，不断巩固工人、贫下中农对学校的领导。水尾片林业工人、贫下中农管理学校初期，一小撮阶级敌人采用种种阴险手段进行破坏，企图维护旧的教育制度，让资产阶级知识分子继续统治学校。面对阶级敌人的猖狂挑衅，水尾片教育革命领导小组组织大家学习毛主席有关阶级斗争和教育革命的教导，并深入开展对修正主义教育路线的革命大批判。通过狠抓阶级斗争和革命大批判，打退了阶级敌人的挑衅，进一步加强了工农团结，更加坚定了广大林业工人、贫下中农管好学校的决心和信心。他们说：“毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气。我们一定要联合起来，共同管好学校，彻底砸烂培育修正主义的苗圃。”
    二、坚持走政治建校道路，用毛泽东思想统帅学校一切工作。过去，党内一小撮走资派等阶级敌人，千方百计地破坏和阻挠学校革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，使学校教育严重脱离无产阶级政治。水尾片林业工人、贫下中农管理学校以后，广泛开展了无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，坚持把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，把学习毛主席著作列为最主要的课程，并普遍建立早请示、晚汇报、天天读、讲用会等制度，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。学校还采取“请进来，走出去”的办法，请林业工人、贫下中农到学校介绍活学活用毛泽东思想的经验体会，讲家史、村史，向师生进行阶级教育，同时组织师生定期到工区和生产队，和林业工人、贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起开斗私批修讲用会。革命师生还组织了十多支毛泽东思想宣传队，到工区、生产队宣传毛泽东思想，把毛主席最新指示及时传送给广大林业工人、贫下中农。群众称赞说：“现在学校培养的学生真是好，有这样的接班人，我们放心。”
    三、以学为主，兼学别样，培养亦文亦武、亦工亦农的劳动者。水尾片小学教育革命领导小组遵照毛主席“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的伟大指示，充分发动群众，批判过去学校关门教学，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产劳动，脱离群众的“三脱离”现象，加强对学生的劳动教育。在林业工人、贫下中农的帮助下，全片各小学根据当地农事季节和生产队需要劳力情况，组织学生下队劳动，一年约有三分之一的时间参加集体生产劳动。此外，各小学都开垦了一部分荒地作为学校从事生产劳动和科学实验的基地。学校经常请老农、林业技术员、卫生员等来讲授农业、林业和卫生知识。他们还组织了木工组、竹器组、理发组，培养学生的劳动观念。
    四、帮助革命教师走与工农相结合的道路，促进教师队伍的思想革命化。毛主席教导说：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”水尾片的林业工人、贫下中农充分认识到，只有建设一支无限忠于毛主席的教师队伍，才能培养出无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。因此，他们管理学校后，把加强教师队伍革命化建设作为一项重要的工作来抓。他们一方面结合伐木场、生产队清理阶级队伍工作，清洗了一些混入教师队伍的坏人，另一方面，他们遵照毛主席“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，帮助教师走出校门，到工区、生产队去做林业工人、贫下中农的“学员”，接受工农的再教育，彻底改造旧思想。过去，有些教师受修正主义教育路线的毒害较深，长期脱离工农群众。现在他们通过和工农群众的接触，思想感情发生了很大变化，真正体会到了林业工人、贫下中农对毛主席最忠诚，阶级觉悟最高，立场最坚定，是自己最好的老师。广大革命教师深有感触地说：“我们走毛主席指引的与工农群众相结合的道路，越走，越觉得毛主席亲；越走，心与工农群众越贴得紧。”广大林业工人、贫下中农也说：“老师过去和我们是陌生人，现在是我们的贴心人。”
