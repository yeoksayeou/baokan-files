The workers' propaganda team at the Weibei Coal Mine Anti-Imperialist Mine Medical Office organizes medical staff to work in the mines and provide medical care in the tunnels.

Under the re-education of the working class, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines of the medical staff have been greatly enhanced, further promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts, and establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an on the 11th, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Weibei Coal Mine Anti-Imperialist Mine Medical Office, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "re-educating intellectuals under the correct leadership, by workers, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly change their old ideas," led the medical staff to go down to the mines in batches, working while providing medical care in the tunnels. This has played a very good role in re-educating the medical staff by workers, peasants, and soldiers, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts, and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the medical office.

The Anti-Imperialist Mine Medical Office has more than 30 medical staff, most of whom are graduates of universities and secondary technical colleges. Due to the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, many of them have lived in high-rise buildings for a long time, alienating themselves from the masses and labor, and have become spoiled. They do not care about the sufferings of the broad masses of laboring people. Although this medical office is set up for miners, it has long served only a few people. When workers and poor and lower-middle peasants come to the medical office for treatment, they not only do not receive the proper treatment but are also subjected to harassment.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at this medical office decided to first solve the problem of "for whom the medical office opens its doors." They organized medical staff from various departments to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Chairman Mao's series of instructions on medical and health work, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. This made the medical staff realize that the question of serving whom is a question of stance, a question of worldview, and whether or not to go deep into the grassroots level to serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is a major issue of whether or not to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and whether or not to be loyal to Chairman Mao. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team led the medical staff to go down to the mines in batches to work and provide medical care in the tunnels, and established this as a system to be carried out persistently.

Two months of practice have proven that in this process, the medical staff's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been greatly enhanced. There was a doctor who, due to being deeply poisoned by the revisionist line, used to see miners coming to the medical office for treatment, and she saw them with faces full of coal dust and bodies full of oil mud, and she did not want to approach them, let alone treat them seriously. The workers' propaganda team then took her down to the mine to work with the miners and to carry out revolutionary criticism together. At the same time, they told her about the tragic fate of countless miners in the old society who died in front of hospitals because they had no money to treat their illnesses, which gave this doctor a great education.

Now, under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the medical staff of this medical office closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They organized medical teams to go out to the miners and poor and lower-middle peasants, regardless of wind and rain, muddy roads, and actively went to their doors to provide medical treatment. The medical office also set up a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda station, where the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants come to the office for treatment, and the medical staff study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them. To facilitate workers and poor and lower-middle peasants coming to the medical office for treatment, the medical office streamlined its organization, reformed many unreasonable regulations, and canceled the registration procedure. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants coming to the medical office for treatment can be seen immediately, which is deeply welcomed by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants.

　　驻渭北煤矿反帝矿医务所工人宣传队组织医护人员
　　一面下井参加劳动　一面在巷道巡回医疗
    在工人阶级的再教育下，大大提高了医护人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步促进了思想革命化，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想
    据新华社西安十一日电　进驻渭北煤矿反帝矿医务所的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于对知识分子“要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的教导，带领医护人员，分期分批下矿井，一面参加劳动，一面在巷道巡回医疗，对医护人员接受工农兵的再教育，促进思想革命化，认真搞好医务所的斗、批、改，起了很好的作用。
    反帝矿医务所有三十多名医护人员，绝大部分是大学和中等技术专科学校毕业的学生。由于受叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的毒害，他们之中许多人长期住在高楼大厦，脱离群众，脱离劳动，染得一身娇气，对广大劳动人民的疾苦漠不关心。这个医务所虽是为矿工开设的，但长期以来只是为少数人服务，工人和贫下中农病了来医务所看病，不但得不到应有的治疗，还受到刁难。
    进驻这个医务所的工人毛泽东思想宣传队针对这种情况，决定首先解决医务所“为谁开门”的问题。他们组织各科室的医护人员，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的一系列指示，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，使医护人员认识到，为谁服务的问题，是个立场问题，是个世界观的问题，愿不愿意深入基层，为广大工农兵服务，是坚持不坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对毛主席忠不忠的大问题。在提高思想认识的基础上，工人毛泽东思想宣传队带领医护人员分期分批下矿井参加劳动，在巷道巡回医疗，并把这作为一项制度，坚持下去。
    两个月的实践证明，在这样做的过程中，大大提高了医护人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。有一个医生，由于受修正主义路线的毒害较深，过去矿工来医务所看病，她看到他们满脸的煤灰，满身的油泥，不愿意接近他们，更不认真给他们治病。工人宣传队便带她下矿井同矿工一块劳动，一块开展革命大批判，同时给她讲述旧社会千千万万个矿工因无钱治病而死在医院门前的悲惨遭遇，使这位医生受到了很大的教育。
    现在，这个医务所的医护人员在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。他们组织了一批一批的巡回医疗队，不管风吹雨打，道路泥泞，自动地找上门去，为矿工和贫下中农看病。医务所里还办起了毛泽东思想宣传站，广大工人和贫下中农来所里看病，医护人员和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示。为方便工人、贫下中农看病，医务所精简了机构，改革了许多不合理的规章制度，取消了挂号手续，工人和贫下中农来医务所看病，随到随看，深受工人和贫下中农的欢迎。
