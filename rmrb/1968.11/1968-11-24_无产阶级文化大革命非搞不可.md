The Communist Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee's communiqué conveyed the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and extremely timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Our practical work in "three-in-one" and "two-military" has proven that Chairman Mao's teachings are extremely wise, extremely correct, and extremely great.

During our military training work in several universities in Shanghai, we witnessed how the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in the educational sector had long been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, viciously sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat, and madly attempting to restore capitalism. As some revolutionary teachers and students have exposed, "They walked the capitalist road, held the power of the bourgeoisie, and the educational content was reactionary, revisionist, and anti-communist, aiming to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie, ultimately to overthrow the proletarian state!" They stuffed traitors, spies, remnants of the Kuomintang, and reactionary academic "authorities" into key positions in the educational sector, seizing control of the schools' teaching, personnel, research, and party affairs. Using the power they had usurped, they engaged in activities to restore capitalism. For example, in a certain engineering university in Shanghai, under the guidance of Comrade Gao Qingxi, a good student of Chairman Mao, a worker class was established in 1958 to cultivate technical personnel for the working class. However, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the university, following the orders of their master Liu Shaoqi, expelled over sixty worker-student graduates in just three years, almost destroying the worker class. In terms of educational content, they vehemently opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, peddling reactionary, revisionist, and anti-communist goods. Rather than saying they promoted "intellectual education first," it would be more accurate to say they implemented a policy of "dumbing down the people," allowing those reactionary academic "authorities" to deceive the students. They did not teach students how to serve socialism or how to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, but rather how to dominate workers and peasants after graduation and how to "manage people." Even more despicable was that the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the educational sector were terrified of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, vehemently opposing and fiercely resisting it. A capitalist-roader in a certain university in Shanghai not only opposed the broad revolutionary teachers and students from studying Chairman Mao's quotations but also arrogantly directed his henchmen to compile his own "collection of speeches," which was severely criticized by the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

These shocking facts show that the class enemy is "still alive but not dead in heart." They are always dreaming of sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism through their agents within the Party, which is an unchanging law of class struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, with his utmost wisdom and timeliness, exposed the tricks of the class enemy and issued the battle cry of "Bombard the Headquarters" to the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country, personally initiating and leading this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the wise leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, thoroughly destroying this bourgeois headquarters and pulling down the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi. This uprooted the root cause of capitalist restoration in our country, ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

Many revolutionary teachers and students have deeply felt that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be carried out! If it were not for Chairman Mao initiating and leading this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a timely manner, our school would have become a tool for capitalist restoration, and we would unknowingly have become successors of the bourgeoisie."

    无产阶级文化大革命非搞不可
    东海舰队驻上海地区军训团
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”我们“三支”“两军”的工作实践证明，毛主席的这一教导，无比英明，无比正确，无比伟大。
    我们在对上海几所大学进行军训工作的过程中，亲眼看到了党内头号走资派刘少奇和他在教育界的代理人，长期以来推行反革命修正主义教育路线，疯狂破坏无产阶级专政，大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。正如有的革命师生所揭发的那样：“他们走的是资本主义的路，掌的是资产阶级的权，教育的内容是资、修、反，培养的目标是接资产阶级的班，最终目的是颠覆无产阶级的江山！”他们把叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽、反动学术“权威”，塞进教育界的各个要害部门，篡夺了学校的教学、人事、科研、党务大权。他们利用篡夺去的权力，大搞复辟资本主义的勾当。例如：上海某工科大学，在毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志倡导下，于一九五八年成立了工人班，培养工人阶级自己的科技人员。可是，这个大学的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，秉承其主子刘少奇的意旨，仅仅三年的时间，就把六十多名工人出身的大学生排挤出校门，几乎把工人班搞垮。在教育内容上，他们极力反对突出无产阶级政治，大肆贩卖资、修、反的黑货。与其说是搞“智育第一”，倒不如说是搞“愚民政策”，听任那些反动学术“权威”蒙骗学生。他们不是教育学生如何为社会主义服务，如何与工农兵相结合，而是教他们出校后如何凌驾于工农之上，如何“管人”。更可恨的是，盘踞在教育界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就象蝙蝠见到阳光那样恐惧，极力反对，拚命抵制。上海某大学的一个走资派，不仅反对广大革命师生学习毛主席语录，还狂妄地指使其爪牙编印他自己的“言论集”，受到广大革命师生的严肃批判。
    这些触目惊心的事实，说明阶级敌人是“人还在，心不死”。他们时刻都在梦想通过他们在党内的代理人破坏无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，破坏社会主义。这是不依人们的意志为转移的阶级斗争的规律。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，最英明、最及时地识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，向全国亿万革命人民，发出了《炮打司令部》的战斗号召，亲自发动和领导了这场无产阶级文化大革命。全国广大的工农兵群众和革命知识分子，在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，向以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部展开了猛烈进攻，彻底摧毁了这个资产阶级司令部，把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇拉下了马。这就挖掉了我国复辟资本主义的总根子，保证了无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
    许多革命师生深有体会地说：“无产阶级文化大革命非搞不可！要不是毛主席他老人家及时发动和领导了这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，我们学校就会变成复辟资本主义的工具，我们就会不自觉地变成资产阶级的接班人。”
