Guangzhou Department Store Establishes New Business Ideology and Style

Guangzhou Department Store's revolutionary committee, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly," has mobilized its revolutionary staff to deeply criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist business line pushed by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They have established a socialist business ideology and style that serves the proletarian politics, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the industrial and agricultural production. The store has undergone a remarkable transformation and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Now, upon entering this department store located in the heart of Guangzhou, one is greeted by a vibrant and revolutionary atmosphere. In every display window, one can see the radiant image of Chairman Mao, his latest directives, and great teachings. The radio broadcasts the voices from the headquarters of the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, as well as important domestic and international news. Each counter is stocked with a variety of daily necessities needed by the laboring people. The salespersons warmly welcome the workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses who come to shop, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and serve the workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses with a spirit of dedication. This spirit has been highly praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The new changes in Guangzhou Department Store are the result of the revolutionary committee's efforts to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. For over a decade, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents have pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist lines of "profit first," "business first," and "bonus first" in the business sector. The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has been intense. In late September this year, after the revolutionary committee was established, with the help of the higher revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the store followed Chairman Mao's directive to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly." They quickly organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and mobilized the revolutionary staff to carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation.

With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the revolutionary staff launched a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist business line, thoroughly sweeping away Liu Shaoqi's revisionist ideology. This significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

At the same time, the revolutionary committee organized the revolutionary staff to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other brilliant works, conducting class education by comparing the old and new societies. The revolutionary staff used Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to examine their work, contrasting their experiences of standing at the counter in the old and new societies. Through study and comparison, the revolutionary staff developed a deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, an even greater love for Chairman Mao, and an unshakable faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionary staff members, after clarifying the socialist business direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and establishing the thought of standing at the counter for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, put forward suggestions and measures, actively doing a good job of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Every evening, the revolutionary staff use Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessly serving others" and "wholeheartedly serving the people" to examine their work of the day, considering it an actual action of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been a powerful driving force for Guangzhou Department Store to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To achieve the battle tasks proposed by the plenary session of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," the revolutionary committee has taken action with a spirit of "seizing the day." They have mobilized revolutionary staff to deeply understand the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for goods, organize supplies according to their requirements, and improve service attitudes and quality. At the same time, the committee members have held meetings with workers, peasants, and laboring people in factories, schools, and neighborhoods to solicit their opinions on the store's management and service work, inviting them to participate in the store's management and supervision. To better transform their thoughts, establish deep class feelings with the working people, familiarize themselves with the production of goods, and improve the quality of service to the working people, the store has also sent some staff to work in some factories.

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The revolutionary staff of Guangzhou Department Store actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, and their spiritual outlook has undergone a remarkable transformation. Their service work for the workers, peasants, and laboring people is constantly improving. "Urgent needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers are our urgent needs, and their thoughts are our thoughts," has become the action slogan of many revolutionary staff members. The daily necessities department of this store previously did not sell cloth straps for carrying bags. However, when the staff discovered that many young students going to the countryside and demoted cadres urgently needed these straps, the purchasing staff went to great lengths to procure them. The knitted goods department, due to limited warehouse space, previously purchased only a few hundred quilts and mosquito nets at a time. Now, seeing the urgent need of young students going to the countryside and demoted cadres, the purchasing staff broke the rules and purchased over a thousand quilts at once. When the warehouse could not accommodate them, the staff cleared out their own office space to store them.

Not long ago, a young student came to the store to buy a quilted jacket to take to the countryside. More than ten days later, when he learned that the place the state had assigned him to go to had warm weather and did not need the quilted jacket, he decided to transfer it to a classmate who needed it and buy some more suitable items. However, his classmate found the quilted jacket did not fit, so he had to return to the store to exchange it. Originally, he thought that since the quilted jacket had been bought for more than ten days, if the store did not exchange it, it would also be reasonable. However, to his surprise, when he explained his difficulties, the salesperson and the cashier discussed and immediately agreed to exchange it. When he received another quilted jacket of the right size, he happily said, "Thank you, your spirit of serving the people is worth learning from!"

    为无产阶级政治服务　为工农兵服务　为工农业生产服务
    广州百货商店树立崭新的经营思想和经营作风
    广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，狠批了刘少奇的反革命修正主义商业路线，精神面貌发生很大变化，服务质量不断提高，受到广大工农兵和革命群众的热烈称赞
    新华社广州二十一日电　广州百货商店革命委员会在伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示指引下，发动广大革命职工深入批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义商业路线，树立为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务、为工农业生产服务的社会主义经营思想和经营作风，使商店面貌焕然一新，受到广大工农兵的欢迎。
    现在，走进这个位于广州市中心的百货商店，到处都可以看到令人振奋的革命的繁荣景象。在商店的各个橱窗里，都可以瞻仰到伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象，可以看到毛主席的最新指示和伟大教导。广播里随时播送来自以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音和国内外的重大消息。各个柜台里陈列着琳琅满目的、劳动人民需用的日用商品。售货员象亲人一样热情地接待前来选购商品的工农兵和革命群众。售货员们积极宣传毛泽东思想，热情为工农兵和革命群众服务的精神，受到了广大工农兵和革命群众的热烈称赞。
    广州百货商店的新变化，是商店广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起斗、批、改高潮以后出现的。十多年来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人在商业战线推行“利润挂帅”、“业务挂帅”、“奖金第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，商店里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直十分激烈。今年九月下旬，商店革命委员会成立后，在上级革委会和人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的指示，迅速举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发动广大革命职工深入开展了革命大批判。广大革命职工
    以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义商业路线，肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义的思想，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    在这同时，商店革委会组织广大革命职工反复学习毛主席的“老三篇”等光辉著作，开展了新旧社会回忆对比的阶级教育。广大革命职工用毛主席的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导对照检查自己的工作，以新旧社会站柜台的两种不同遭遇进行忆苦思甜。通过学习和回忆对比，广大革命职工对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇更加仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想更加无限信仰。许多革命职工在明确了为工农兵服务的社会主义经营方向，树立了为工农兵站柜台的思想以后，都纷纷提建议，订措施，积极做好为工农兵服务的工作。广大革命职工每天晚上都以毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”、“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，来对照检查自己一天的工作，以做好为工农兵服务的工作，作为忠于伟大领袖毛主席、忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的实际行动。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，是促进广州百货商店更好地为工农兵服务的强大动力。商店革委会为了实现全会提出的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的战斗任务，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神行动起来。他们一方面发动革命职工深入了解工农兵对商品的需要，根据工农兵的要求组织货源，努力改进服务态度，提高服务质量；同时，革委会的委员分别到工厂、学校、街道召开工农兵和劳动人民的座谈会，征求他们对商店经营管理和服务工作的意见，邀请他们参加商店的管理和监督工作。为了使职工们更好地改造思想，和工农劳动群众建立深厚的阶级感情，熟悉商品生产情况，提高为工农劳动群众服务的质量，商店还抽调部分职工到一些工厂去参加劳动。
    “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”广州百货商店广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，精神面貌焕然一新，为工农兵和劳动群众的服务工作不断改进。“急工农兵所急，想工农兵所想”，已经成为许多革命职工的行动口号。这个商店的日用品部，过去不经营打背包用的布带。可是，当职工们发现许多上山下乡的青年学生和下放干部迫切需要这种布带时，采购员就千方百计去进货。针织品部由于仓库容量有限，过去每次最多采购几百床棉被、蚊帐等床上用品。现在，见到上山下乡的青年学生和下放干部迫切需要，采购员就打破常规，一次采购了一千多床棉被回来。仓库放不下，职工们就腾出自己办公的地方来储放。
    不久前，一位青年学生来店里买了一件棉衣，准备上山下乡穿。十多天后，当他知道国家分配他去的地方天气暖和，用不上这件棉衣时，他决定把它转让给一个需用棉衣的同学，另买一些合用的东西。可是，他的同学穿上这件棉衣不合身，他只好跑到商店去要求另换一件。原来他想，棉衣已买了十多天了，如果商店不退换也是合理的。但是，出乎他的意料，当他一摆出自己的困难，售货员和会计出纳人员商量了一下，立即答应给他退换。当他拿到另一件合尺码的棉衣时，他高兴得连声说：“谢谢你们，你们为人民服务的精神，值得我好好学习！”
