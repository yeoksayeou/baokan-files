Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen fighting on the frontline of the Fujian coastal defense at Huangqi Peninsula's four brigades have broken through the numerous obstacles of the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. In 1965, they established a "Yan'an-style" private fishery middle school. Over the past three years, this new type of school has cultivated a batch of literate laborers who are both literate and skilled, who can both fish and farm, and who have socialist consciousness. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen enthusiastically welcome graduates from this school, praising them as "new-type fishermen of the Mao Zedong era."

Born Amidst the Storms of Class Struggle

Huangqi Peninsula is separated from the U.S.-backed Chiang Kai-shek forces on Mazu Island by just a narrow stretch of water, making it a frontline post for anti-enemy struggles. Before liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen here had lived a miserable life of "the sea as their bed and waves as their quilt, a fishing net half covering their bodies." They had no right to go to school. After liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen stood up and became masters of their own fate, enjoying a happy socialist life. A primary school was established on the peninsula, and their children, for the first time, entered school. With the development of cultural education and the need to cultivate scientific talents for fishery production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen urgently demanded the establishment of a middle school on the peninsula. However, due to the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his local agents, the middle school was established in Lianjiang County, more than 120 miles away from the peninsula. The children of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen were still kept out of school. According to investigations by the Haijian, Haining, Haijing, and Haifeng brigades, since liberation, out of three university graduates, not one was a child of a poor peasant, and out of four high school students, only one was a son of a poor peasant. The vast majority of children of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen could not leave their hometowns to attend middle school after graduating from primary school. Even those who managed to attend middle school were held back by examinations, retention policies, and age restrictions, causing them to drop out midway.

In 1965, during the fervent socialist education movement in the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen in the Haijian, Haining, Haijing, and Haifeng brigades of Huangqi Peninsula, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and established a fishery middle school, taking hold of the educational power.

The walking capitalists within the former Lianjiang County Committee and a handful of class enemies in society were terrified and enraged by this revolutionary action. They spread rumors and slanders everywhere, trying every means to sabotage the school, saying things like, "Private, private, it will eventually disband." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies openly jumped out to cause trouble, shouting, "Private schools must be disbanded immediately!" "Educational power cannot be in the hands of the peasants!" They attempted to smash and disperse this private fishery middle school. Facing the rampant sabotage activities of the class enemies, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support," and became even more determined to run the school. They formed a management committee consisting of representatives from poor and lower-middle peasants, fishermen, technicians, brigade cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students, firmly holding the educational power in their own hands. When the class enemies instigated some uninformed cadres to take back the school's kelp production base, the poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen firmly refused, declaring, "The fishery middle school is one we established ourselves, and the kelp fields are ours! If the school needs more, we will allocate another piece!"

Over the past three years, this fishery middle school, established and directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen, has grown and strengthened amidst the storms of class struggle.

Promoting Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Learning Style

The Huangqi Fishery Middle School Management Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the most important problem for a school is to select the principal and teachers and to determine the educational policy," selected revolutionary young intellectuals with good class backgrounds, good thoughts, and practical experience in production to serve as full-time teachers. They invited old poor peasants, fishermen, technicians, PLA soldiers, and revolutionary cadres with rich experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment to serve as part-time teachers. They determined that this school would use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, with class struggle education as the main course, using fishing boats, breeding grounds, and fields as classrooms, combining theory with practice, and cultivating literate laborers who are both literate and skilled and who have socialist consciousness.

On the first day of school, the school management committee distributed a copy of the revolutionary classic "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Volume B)" to each revolutionary teacher and student, with the first reading being "In Memory of Norman Bethune"; the first class was a class struggle education course, inviting old fishermen to tell the revolutionary teachers and students about the history of fishermen's blood and tears and the arduous and tortuous struggle to establish this school; the first task was to build the school buildings themselves.

The school management committee also, based on the needs of developing agriculture and fishery production and coastal defense anti-enemy struggles, and in consultation with the opinions of the four brigades' poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen, set up four courses: political courses centered on studying Mao Zedong Thought, military courses, technical courses, and labor courses. The courses were arranged according to the characteristics of agricultural and fishery production seasons and the needs of anti-enemy struggles. More learning during slack periods, less learning during busy periods, and all teachers and students participating in productive labor during peak busy seasons, learning while working. Classrooms were spread across fishing boats, sea areas, breeding grounds, fields, and shooting ranges.

When studying political courses, teachers and students would take Mao Zedong's works with them, go among the masses, go into the storms of class struggle, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and engage in anti-enemy struggles.

When studying military courses, teachers and students would directly participate in coastal defense anti-enemy struggles. They organized themselves into classes, platoons, and companies, formed core classes and core platoons, invited PLA soldiers to teach military knowledge, and conducted combat training. School teachers and students all learned a set of skills to fight the enemy. During the day, they could quickly gather and engage in battle when encountering enemy situations; at night, they would return to their brigades and stand guard, patrol, and defend the coast with the militia. Now, the students of the fishery middle school have become a core force in coastal defense anti-enemy struggles.

Technical courses are taught according to the principle of learning and using simultaneously. The course content mainly includes basic knowledge of machinery, fishing, kelp breeding, agricultural technology, and financial accounting. During classes, they would go to practice, learning while practicing.

The revolutionary teachers and students of this school insisted on self-reliance and thrift in running the school. When the school buildings collapsed, they rebuilt them themselves; when the boats leaked, they repaired them themselves; they wove and mended their own fishing nets, made their own desks and chairs, and cut their own hair. Because this school has a good revolutionary learning style, the students it cultivates not only have theoretical knowledge but also can participate in productive labor and have a good style of hard work, thrift, and close ties with the masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen are very satisfied with such a school and praise it as a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Becoming New-Type Farmers and Fishermen

In July of this year, the first batch of 52 students from Huangqi Fishery Middle School graduated. Before graduation, they held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticizing the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist black goods of "studying to become officials" and "seeking fame and profit." They all expressed their determination to Chairman Mao and voluntarily requested to return to the production teams to participate in collective production labor. They said, "We are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen cultivated by Chairman Mao. Our aspiration is to become new-type farmers and fishermen."

This batch of graduates from poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen, after graduation, except for one who joined the People's Navy, all returned to the production brigades. Some became engine operators, some became kelp breeders, some became offshore fishing team members, and some participated in agricultural production labor. They all became the backbone of agricultural and fishery production in the brigades. Among them, six graduates were selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants as active learners and promoters of Mao Zedong Thought in the brigades and communes. The vast majority of graduates became study group leaders of Mao Zedong's works in the production teams.

The students cultivated by the fishery middle school are completely different from those cultivated by old schools. Local poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen, comparing the graduates of the two types of schools, deeply felt, "Students who go to the county to study have two airs: arrogance and pampering. Students from the fishery middle school also have two airs: revolutionary spirit and labor spirit. Having such a school as the fishery middle school to cultivate successors for us, we are at ease!"

　　一所“抗大”式的民办渔业中学
    在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想的光辉照耀下，战斗在福建海防最前线黄岐半岛上四个大队的广大贫下中农和渔民，冲破大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的重重阻挠，于一九六五年创办了一所“抗大”式的民办渔业中学。三年来，这所新型的学校培养出了一批能文能武，亦渔亦农，有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，广大贫下中农和渔民非常欢迎从这个学校毕业的学生，赞扬他们是“毛泽东时代的新型渔民”。
    在阶级斗争的风浪中诞生
    黄岐半岛，与美蒋盘踞的马祖列岛只有一水之隔，是对敌斗争的前哨阵地。解放前，这里的广大贫下中农和渔民世世代代过着“大海为铺浪作被，一片渔网半遮身”的苦难生活，根本没有上学读书的权力。解放后，广大贫下中农、渔民翻身当了主人，过上了社会主义的幸福生活，半岛上办起了一所小学，他们的子女破天荒地进了学校。随着文化教育事业的发展和培养渔业生产科学人才的需要，广大贫下中农、渔民迫切要求在半岛上办一所中学。但是，由于大叛徒刘少奇及其在当地的代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义教育路线，把中学办在离半岛一百二十多里远的连江县城里，广大贫下中农和渔民的子女仍然被拒于学校大门之外。据海建、海新、海英、海丰四个大队的调查，解放以来，三个大学毕业生中，没有一个是贫下中农的子女，上高中的四个学生中只有一个是贫农的儿子。绝大多数贫下中农、渔民的子女小学毕业后不能远离家乡去上中学；就是一部分上了中学的，也被考试、留级、年龄等道道关卡卡住，弄得中途停学。
    一九六五年，黄岐半岛上海建、海新、海英、海丰四个大队的贫下中农和渔民，在轰轰烈烈的农村社会主义教育运动中，遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大教导，发扬自力更生的精神，办起了一所渔业中学，掌握了学校的教育大权。
      旧连江县委内的走资派和社会上的一小撮阶级敌人对这一革命行动，怕得要命，恨得要死。他们到处煽阴风，点鬼火，千方百计想搞垮这所中学，胡说什么：“民办民办，迟早要散。”无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人又公然跳出来进行破坏，叫嚷什么“民办学校必须立即解散”“教育大权不能由泥腿子来掌”，企图把这所民办渔业中学冲垮、压散。面对阶级敌人的猖狂破坏活动，广大贫下中农、渔民牢记毛主席“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”的伟大教导，更加坚定了办学的信心，组成了一个有贫下中农、渔民、技术员代表、大队干部和革命师生代表参加的管理委员会，把教育大权牢牢地掌握在自己手里。阶级敌人挑动一些不明真象的干部要收回学校的海带生产基地，贫下中农、渔民坚决不让，斩钉截铁地说：“渔业中学是我们自己办的，海带地是我们自己的！如果学校需要，我们还要再划给一片！”
    三年来，这所由贫下中农、渔民亲自创办，直接管理的渔民中学，就这样，在阶级斗争的风浪里不断成长壮大。
　　发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风
    黄岐渔业中学管理委员会遵照毛主席关于一个学校“最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针”的伟大教导，挑选了成份好，思想好，经过劳动锻炼，有生产实践经验的革命知识青年担任专职教师，邀请有阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动丰富经验的老贫农、渔民、技术员、解放军指战员和革命干部担任兼职教师。他们确定这所学校以毛主席著作为基本教材，以阶级斗争教育为主课，以渔船、养殖场、田间为课堂，理论联系实际，培养能文能武，有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    学校开学的第一天，校管理委员会就发给每个革命师生一册革命宝书《毛泽东著作选读（乙种本）》，念的第一篇是《为人民服务》；上的第一课是阶级教育课，请老渔民向革命师生讲述渔民血泪史和创办这所中学的艰难曲折的战斗历程；做的第一件事是自己动手修建校舍。
    学校管理委员会还根据发展农、渔业生产和海防对敌斗争的需要，和四个大队贫下中农、渔民的意见，设置了以学习毛泽东思想为主的政治课、军事课、技术课、劳动课等四门功课。课程按照农、渔业生产季节特点和对敌斗争的需要进行适当安排。闲时多学，忙时少学，大忙季节全部师生参加生产劳动，边劳动，边学习。课堂遍及渔船、海区、养殖场、田头、靶场。
    学习政治课，师生们就带着毛主席著作，到群众中去，到阶级斗争大风大浪中去，和贫下中农、渔民一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起斗私批修，一起开展对敌斗争。
    学军事课，师生们就直接参加海防对敌斗争。他们按照民兵组织形式，编成班、排、连，成立基干班、基干排，请驻军指战员讲军事知识，进行作战训练。学校师生都学会了一套杀敌本领，白天遇到敌情，能迅速集中，迎接战斗；夜间，他们回到本大队，和民兵一起站岗放哨、巡逻，保卫海防。现在，渔业中学的学生已成为一支海防对敌斗争的骨干力量。
    技术课是按照学用一致的原则进行教学的。教材内容主要是轮机、捕捞、海带养殖、农业技术、财务会计等基本知识。上课时，到实践中去边实践，边学习。
    这所学校革命师生坚持自力更生，勤俭办学，校舍塌了自己盖，船漏了自己修，渔网自己织，破了自己补，缺少桌椅自己造，头发自己理。由于这所学校革命学风好，培养出来的学生既有理论知识，又能参加生产劳动，又有艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的好作风，贫下中农、渔民十分满意这样的学校，赞扬它是毛泽东思想的大学校。
    做一个新型的农民和渔民
    今年七月，黄岐渔业中学第一批五十二名学生毕业了，毕业前夕，举办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，狠批大叛徒刘少奇的
  “读书做官”、“为名为利”的反革命修正主义黑货，个个向毛主席表示决心，自觉地要求回到生产队参加集体生产劳动。他们说：“我们是毛主席培养出来的贫下中农和渔民儿女，我们的志愿就是做一个新型的农民和渔民。”
    这批贫下中农、渔民的儿女毕业后，除一人参加人民海军外，其他全部回到生产大队，有的当轮机员、有的当海带养殖员、有的当外海捕捞队员、有的参加农业生产劳动，他们都成为大队里农、渔业生产的骨干力量。其中有六名毕业生被贫下中农选为大队、公社活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。绝大多数毕业生都成为生产队学习毛主席著作的辅导员。
      从渔业中学培养出来的学生，同旧学校培养出来的学生完全两样。当地贫下中农、渔民对比了两种学校毕业的学生，深有感触地说：“到县上读书的学生有二气：骄气和娇气；渔中学生也有二气：革命朝气和劳动力气。有渔中这样的学校为我们培养接班人，我们就放心了！”
