At the revolutionary criticism meeting held at Hebei Primary School in Majia Bridge Commune, Tong County, Beijing, old peasant Gong Deming held a "withdrawal notice" in one hand and a "Five Good Soldier" certificate from a PLA soldier in the other, vehemently denouncing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi.

Gong Deming is now the head of the school's revolutionary education leadership group. In the old society, his family had been working as slaves for landlords for generations, with no one ever having the chance to go to school. After liberation, Grandpa Gong sent his son, Gong Hua, to this school. Gong Hua loved labor from a young age and always helped with community work after school. Because his grades were "low," the school forced him to write a "withdrawal notice" and expelled him.

Later, Gong Hua joined the army. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, he remembered the instructions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's books diligently, and memorized every word of the "Three Articles." Soon, he was proudly admitted into the Communist Party of China and was named a Five Good Soldier every year. Whenever Grandpa Gong received a letter from Gong Hua, he felt that the school's system of "grading first" was a revisionist black commodity that specifically harmed the poor and lower-middle peasants. He had gone to the school several times to voice his opinions, but since the power was in their hands, the school paid no attention to him.

After Grandpa Gong took over the school, he was determined to smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi to pieces and open the gates wide for the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating more successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. After discussing with everyone, he invited all the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who had been expelled or forced to drop out of school in the past, or who had not been able to enroll for other reasons, to come to school and study in the appropriate classes on a voluntary basis. However, some teachers wanted to set exam questions to "test" them and "rank them by scores." Grandpa Gong immediately saw that this was the old "grading first" counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line rearing its head again. He thought: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without destruction, there can be no construction." If we do not smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line cannot occupy the school's position, the school gates cannot be opened wide for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and the enrollment work cannot be done well. This is why Grandpa Gong participated in the criticism meeting with the "withdrawal notice" and the "Five Good Soldier" certificate.

Through this lively revolutionary criticism meeting, all the revolutionary teachers and students in the school received a profound education on the two-line struggle. The teachers stood up one after another to eliminate the past revisionist poison of "recognizing scores but not people, recognizing people but not class," and canceled the plan to rank students by exam scores. The day after the criticism meeting, the school gates were adorned with red flags. Revolutionary teachers and students, carrying a large portrait of Chairman Mao, drumming and cheering, warmly welcomed the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enroll. The school presented a brand-new revolutionary scene.

### 为贫下中农子女大开校门

    为贫下中农子女大开校门
    在北京市通县马桥公社河北小学的革命大批判的会场上，老贫农贡得明一手抓着一张“退学单”，一手拿着解放军战士的“五好战士证书”，厉声痛斥叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线。
    贡得明现在是学校教育革命领导小组负责人。在旧社会，他家祖祖辈辈给地主当牛做马，没有一个念书的，解放后，贡大爷把孩子贡华送到这所学校。贡华从小就爱劳动，放学后，总是忙着给社里干活。因为他的功课“分数低”，学校就逼着他写了这张“退学单”，硬是把他挤出了校门。
    后来贡华参军了，在解放军这所毛泽东思想的大学校里，他牢记贫下中农的嘱咐，下功夫读毛主席的书，把“老三篇”字字句句记心间，不久，他光荣地加入了中国共产党，年年被评为五好战士。每当贡大爷接到贡华的来信，就觉得学校“分数挂帅”的制度，是专坑害贫下中农的修正主义黑货。他曾到学校提过几次意见，可是权在人家手里，学校没人理会他。
    贡大爷进驻学校后，决心要把叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线砸个稀巴烂，为贫下中农敞开大门，为无产阶级革命事业培养更多的接班人。他和大家商量后，把过去被学校排挤和强迫退学的或因其他原因没有入学的贫下中农子女都请到学校来，按自愿的原则插班学习。可是有些教师却要出题目“考一考”，“按分数高低”编级。贡大爷一眼就看出这又是过去那套“分数挂帅”的反革命修正主义教育路线在作怪。他想：毛主席教导我们，“不破不立”，不砸烂叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线就不能占领学校阵地，校门就不能向贫下中农的孩子敞开，招生工作也就搞不好。这就是贡大爷带着“退学单”和“五好战士证书”参加批判大会的由来。
    通过这次生动的革命大批判，全校革命师生受到了一次深刻的两条路线斗争教育。教师们纷纷起来清除过去“认分不认人，认人不认阶级”的修正主义流毒，取消了考试分级的打算。批判大会后的第二天，学校门前红旗招展，革命师生抬着巨幅毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎贫下中农子女入学。学校出现一片崭新的革命气象。　张雨生
