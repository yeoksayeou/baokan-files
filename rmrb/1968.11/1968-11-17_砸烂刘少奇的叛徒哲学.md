Title: Smash Liu Shaoqi's Traitor Philosophy

Traitor, internal enemy, and running dog of the bourgeoisie Liu Shaoqi fervently advocates traitor philosophy, concocting "legitimate" theoretical grounds for the despicable traitors. He blathers on about how "a good commander in battle, while shouting 'only victory, no retreat,' actually has a plan in mind: if defeated, just run away." He also says that "some people become traitors" simply because of "a moment's thought." What a filthy soul, what a despicable face!

Revolutionary integrity is, for a revolutionary, more precious than life by a hundred, a thousand times. In the face of life-and-death struggles between two classes, a true proletarian revolutionary always remembers the proletarian revolutionary cause and maintains the revolutionary will and integrity of the proletariat. Looking back at the history of the Chinese revolution, countless Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, whether on the battlefield shrouded in smoke or in the enemy's gloomy prison; whether facing the brutal torture of murderous bandits or the endless enticements of executioners, they always maintained a firm revolutionary integrity, willing to sacrifice their lives for the proletarian revolutionary cause, regarding death as a return home. They are "great in life, glorious in death." They "die for the people's interests" and are "heavier than Mount Tai." In the face of such towering heroes, Liu Shaoqi the traitor and his followers are not even worth a pile of dog shit.

"To have sacrifices is to have great aspirations, daring to make the sun and moon shine anew." "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies." Revolutionary fighters are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, daring to trample all seemingly powerful enemies underfoot, and never yielding to the enemy. Take the Battle of Triangle Hill as an example. On the eve of our army's all-out counteroffensive, we entered the trenches for battle. The American wolves, who are as cruel as jackals, bombarded the hilltop with thousands of heavy shells every day, sealing off the entrances and cutting off our supply lines, thinking they could starve us to death or thirst us to death. The American wolves also launched a reactionary political offensive, demanding that we surrender our weapons. However, in the face of heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this is nothing but the whimpering of flies. We are an invincible revolutionary army, we only advance, never retreat! We stood before Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: to defend Chairman Mao, to defend our country and the Korean people, we would rather die than lose an inch of the battlefield! The soldiers were all steel and iron heroes. After fourteen days and nights, the Triangle Hill battlefield remained unshaken, and the enemy, except for leaving behind corpses, did not get a drop of oil. The victory of the Battle of Triangle Hill dealt a heavy blow to Liu Shaoqi's traitor philosophy.

What kind of vine bears what kind of fruit, traitors talk about traitor experiences. Throughout history, both at home and abroad, traitors have always had their own "traitor philosophy," and Liu Shaoqi is no exception. He advocates that "some people become traitors" simply because of "a moment's thought." What a casual remark! We ask Liu Shaoqi, you, trembling and fearful, crawled out of the doghole opened by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang, bowed and scraped before the enemy, wept and repented for your "mistakes," is this really "a moment's thought"? No, it is absolutely not "a moment's thought," but a complete exposure of your extremely despicable and shameful soul! Traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices are counter-revolutionaries oozing stench from every pore!

Liu Shaoqi advocates traitor philosophy with extremely malicious intentions. For a long time, he has pursued a thoroughly counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line. Under the protection of this line, those traitors worse than pigs and dogs have all risen to prominence, some even usurping key positions, planting a bourgeois headquarters within the proletarian dictatorship. They conspire to seize power from the proletariat, replacing it with bourgeois dictatorship. If their plot succeeds, then "it is inevitable that a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration will occur, the Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the entire China will change color." Think about it, comrades, what a dangerous scenario!

Ants trying to shake a tree are delusional, a beautiful dream of yellow millet is just a dream. After more than two years of repeated and fierce class struggles, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his pack of wolves have finally been exposed one by one. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, smash and expose Liu Shaoqi the great traitor and the traitor philosophy he peddles, eliminate the poison, and ensure he never rises again!

　　砸烂刘少奇的叛徒哲学
　　上甘岭特等功臣、某团副政委　赵毛臣
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇狂热地鼓吹叛徒哲学，为无耻的叛徒炮制“合法”的理论根据。他胡说什么：“一个好的指挥官在作战时，口里讲的是只准打胜仗，不准后退，其实心里有个打算，万一打败了，还不是开溜。”还说什么“有些人当了叛徒”，只不过是“一念之差”。这是多么肮脏的灵魂，多么卑鄙的嘴脸！
    革命的气节，对于一个革命者来说，比生命还宝贵百倍、千倍。在两个阶级的生死搏斗面前，作为一个真正的无产阶级革命战士，每时每刻念念不忘的是无产阶级革命事业，是永远保持无产阶级的革命意志和革命气节。翻一翻中国革命的历史，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无数共产党员和革命志士，无论在硝烟弥漫的战场，还是在敌人阴森的监狱里；无论是杀人强盗的严刑拷打，还是刽子手们的百般利诱，他们始终保持着坚定的革命气节，愿为无产阶级革命事业抛头颅、洒热血，视死如归。他们“生的伟大，死的光荣”。他们“为人民利益而死”“比泰山还重”。在顶天立地的英雄面前，叛徒刘少奇和他的徒子徒孙们，连一堆臭狗屎都不如。
      “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”。革命战士无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，敢于把一切貌似强大的敌人踩在脚下，而决不被敌人所屈服。就拿我亲身经历的上甘岭战役来说吧，在我军全面大反攻前夕，我们进入坑道作战。豺狼成性的美国强盗每天用几千发重磅炮弹轰炸山头，封锁洞口，切断我军运输，以为这下子可以困死、饿死、渴死我们。美国强盗还采取反动的政治攻势，要我们交枪投降。然而，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄战士面前，这不过是苍蝇的抽泣。我们是战无不胜的革命军队，我们只有前进，决不后退！我们站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：为了保卫毛主席、保卫祖国和朝鲜人民，头可断、血可流，阵地一寸不能丢！战士们人人是钢铸铁打的英雄汉。整整十四昼夜过去了，上甘岭阵地岿然不动，敌人除了撂下尸体，半点油水也没捞到。上甘岭战役的胜利，给叛徒刘少奇的叛徒哲学一个有力的打击。
    什么藤结什么瓜，叛徒讲的叛徒经。古今中外的叛徒们，都有一套“叛徒哲学”，刘少奇当然也不例外。他鼓吹什么“有些人当了叛徒”，只不过是“一念之差”。好一个“一念之差”，说得何等轻松！我们要问刘少奇，你战战兢兢地从日本帝国主义和国民党开的狗洞里爬出来，卑躬屈膝地拜倒在敌人的脚下，痛哭流涕地忏悔自己的“过错”，这难道是“一念之差”？不，根本不是什么“一念之差”，而是你十分卑鄙、十分无耻的灵魂的大暴露！叛徒刘少奇及其同伙，是每个毛孔都散发出臭气的反革命！
    刘少奇鼓吹叛徒哲学，是有极其恶毒的用心的。长期以来，他推行一条地地道道的反革命修正主义组织路线。在这条路线的庇护下，那些猪狗不如的叛徒们，一个个飞黄腾达，有些甚至窃踞要职，在无产阶级专政内部，埋下了一个资产阶级司令部。他们阴谋向无产阶级夺权，以资产阶级专政替代它。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，那么“就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。请同志们想一想，这是一种多么危险的情景啊！”
    蚍蜉撼树不自量，黄粱美梦一场空。经过两年多反复激烈的阶级大搏斗，终于把大叛徒刘少奇及其狐群狗党一个个揪了出来，我们要发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，把大叛徒刘少奇和他所贩卖的叛徒哲学批倒、批臭，肃清流毒，叫他永世不得翻身！
