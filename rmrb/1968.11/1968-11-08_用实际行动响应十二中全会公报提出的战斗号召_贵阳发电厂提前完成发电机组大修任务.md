Inspired by the great encouragement from the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers of the Guizhou Power Plant, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, swiftly implemented the great call from the communiqué to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness, to build our socialist industry, socialist agriculture, and all socialist undertakings even more excellently." They completed the major overhaul of a 25,000-kilowatt generator unit, which was originally planned to take half a month, in just seven days. This provides more electricity for industrial and agricultural production.

The overhaul of this generator unit began on October 28. On the night of November 1, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee reached the Guizhou Power Plant. The construction site immediately buzzed with excitement. The workers decided to complete the overhaul of the generator unit ahead of schedule to respond to the battle call of the communiqué with practical actions.

On the joyous day of the communiqué's release, the construction site was filled with a hot and tense atmosphere of battle. The workers participating in the overhaul studied the communiqué earnestly and discussed the victories achieved one after another in the factory's struggle, criticism, and reform under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They linked this to the unprecedented good situation in Guizhou where many factories and mines had completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets. They deeply felt the correctness of the communiqué's pointing out that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great driving force for our socialist production." The more they talked about the good situation, the more enthusiastic they became. Everyone thought about how some factories and mines would be temporarily affected by the reduction in power supply due to the overhaul of the generator unit. They decided to race against time to complete the overhaul of the generator unit as soon as possible to achieve new victories for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The communiqué is a mobilization order, mobilizing all the workers participating in the overhaul. They one by one expressed their determination to Chairman Mao. The workers, with sky-high enthusiasm, voluntarily took on heavy tasks, broke through technical difficulties, and greatly promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Many work teams completed in one day what usually took three days.

The communiqué gave the workers of the Guizhou Power Plant great strength to boldly reform unreasonable regulations and systems. The workers held several criticism meetings on the construction site, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts running the factory," and thoroughly breaking the old rules and bad habits that shackled the workers. The wisdom and creativity of the worker masses, long suppressed by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, were liberated. Many production and technical difficulties were solved by the workers holding "Zhuge Liang" meetings on the spot, pooling their wisdom and strength. The workers dared to think and dare to do, realizing many technological innovations, greatly improving work efficiency, shortening the overhaul time of the generator unit. After the test run, the quality of this overhaul is completely qualified.

A standing committee member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and worker of the Guizhou Power Plant, Luo Xikang, also returned to the factory to participate in the labor of the generator unit overhaul project. He was originally a boiler operator of this factory. This year, during the National Day, he went to Beijing to participate in the celebration and saw the great leader Chairman Mao. After returning to Guizhou, he decided to follow the example of Chen Yonggui, the party secretary of the Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi, to "be both an official and a common person," and returned to the factory to participate in the labor. During the labor, he conveyed to the workers the situation of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, sharing with the workers this greatest happiness, greatly encouraging the workers.

    用实际行动响应十二中全会公报提出的战斗号召
    贵阳发电厂提前完成发电机组大修任务
    新华社贵阳七日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，贵阳发电厂的革命工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席最深厚的无产阶级感情，雷厉风行地落实全会公报中提出的“我们必须抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，把我国的社会主义工业、社会主义农业和一切社会主义事业建设得更加出色”的伟大号召，只用七天时间，就提前完成了计划半个月完成的一台二万五千瓩发电机组的大修任务，为工农业生产提供更多的电力。
    这台发电机组的大修工作是十月二十八日开始的。十一月一日夜晚，党的八届十二中全会公报传到了贵阳发电厂，工地上立即沸腾起来，工人们决心提前完成发电机组的大修任务，用实际行动来响应公报的战斗号召。
    在公报发表的大喜日子里，工地上充满了热烈而紧张的战斗气氛。参加检修的工人们认真学习公报，畅谈在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，工厂斗、批、改取得的一个接一个的胜利。他们联系贵阳地区许多厂矿提前超额完成全年生产任务的空前大好形势，深刻地体会到公报所指出的“无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力”的英明和正确。工人们越摆大好形势，心里越热呼呼，大家想到因为发电机组大修，有些厂矿的生产因电力供应减少而要暂时受到一些影响时，决心争分夺秒，争取早日完成发电机组的大修任务，为无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
    公报是动员令，把参加检修的工人都动员起来了。他们一个个向毛主席表决心。工人们以冲天的干劲，自觉地挑重担，破技术难关，共产主义协作精神大发扬，许多班组一天完成了平时需要三天完成的工作量。
    公报给了贵阳发电厂的工人们大胆改革不合理规章制度的巨大力量。工人们在施工现场召开了多次批判会，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，大破束缚工人手脚的陈规陋习。工人群众长期被叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线压抑的聪明才智得到了解放，许多生产和技术上的难关，都由工人在现场开“诸葛亮”会，群策群力，很快得到了解决。工人们敢想、敢干，实现了许多技术革新项目，大大提高了工效，缩短了发电机组的大修时间，经过试车，这次检修质量完全合格。
    贵州省革委会常委、贵阳发电厂工人罗锡康，也回厂参加了发电机组大修工程的劳动。他原来是这个厂的司炉，今年国庆到北京参加观礼，见到了伟大领袖毛主席，回到贵阳后，他决心以山西大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志为榜样，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，回厂参加劳动。在劳动中，他向工人们传达了见到伟大领袖毛主席的情况，同工人们分享这一最大幸福，使工人们受到了巨大的鼓舞。
