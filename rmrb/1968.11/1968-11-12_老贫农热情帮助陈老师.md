One day, in Dongfeng Commune, Qianjin Brigade, Nanhai County, Guangdong, some teachers from the school were organized to write slogans and produce wall newspapers. The poor peasant, Fan Jiu Gao, saw that Teacher Chen looked unhappy, muttering to himself, "I only receive a salary for teaching, and I haven't received any other allowances." He was dissatisfied with the brigade's assignment of propaganda work to him. This matter stayed on Fan Jiu Gao's mind. He wanted to tell the brigade leaders to do some ideological work with Teacher Chen to raise his awareness of "serving the people." But when he thought about Chairman Mao's teachings on "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," he went to the school to talk with Teacher Chen and, linking it to reality, studied the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Fan Jiu Gao's sincere help deeply moved Teacher Chen, who decided to establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people and do a good job in teaching.

Not long after, the brigade decided to establish a junior high school class attached to the primary school and assigned Teacher Chen to be a middle school teacher. Teacher Chen was worried about the heavy workload and had some reservations. Fan Jiu Gao learned about this and took Chairman Mao's little red book with him to see Teacher Chen again. After reading the quote "The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do" word by word, he said earnestly, "Teacher Chen, assigning you to teach middle school is a sign that we poor peasants trust you. You must remember Chairman Mao's words and be ready to take on heavy responsibilities!" Teacher Chen felt both ashamed and excited, saying, "Uncle Fan, your help is like a timely rain. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and take on this heavy responsibility." From then on, Teacher Chen's work enthusiasm grew stronger, and during labor, he always took on the heaviest and hardest tasks.

Although Teacher Chen worked happily and was praised by everyone, Uncle Fan discovered new problems. Once, taking advantage of Teacher Chen being alone in the room repairing tables and chairs, he mobilized the brigade's commune members, militia, and older students to come to the school. With many hands, they repaired and made more than a hundred tables and chairs in half a day. Teacher Chen was so happy that he didn't know how to thank Uncle Fan. Fan Jiu Gao took out the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sat down with Teacher Chen, seriously studying the part where Chairman Mao says, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, one fails to get even the most elementary knowledge." He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to follow the mass line. This is crucial. As the saying goes, 'With united hearts, mountains can be moved,' and a lone warrior cannot achieve much!"

The poor peasant Fan Jiu Gao talked with Teacher Chen three times, and each time deeply touched his soul. Teacher Chen said, "The poor peasants love Chairman Mao the most. Uncle Fan's three talks with me are worth more than reading ten years of books."

　　老贫农热情帮助陈老师
    有一天，广东南海县东风公社前进大队组织学校的一些老师写标语，办墙报，老贫农范巨高看见陈老师满脸不高兴，嘴巴嘟嘟嚷嚷叨咕：“我只领教学一份薪金，可没有领其它补贴。”对大队派他搞宣传工作不满意。这件事，范大叔一直挂在心上，他本想告诉大队领导，去给陈老师做做思想工作，提高提高“为人民服务”的认识。但一想到毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的教导，他就来到学校找陈老师谈心，并联系实际学习《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作。范大叔的热心帮助，使陈老师很受感动，他决心树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，搞好教学工作。
    不久，大队决定小学要办附设初中班，调陈老师担任中学教师。陈老师怕任务重，思想有顾虑。范大叔了解到这一情况，就带上毛主席的宝书，又去找陈老师。他一字一句地念完“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的语录后，语重意深地说：“陈老师，叫你去教中学，这是咱贫下中农信得过你，你可要记住毛主席他老人家的话，要勇挑重担子啊！”陈老师又惭愧又激动地说：“范大叔，你对我的帮助真是及时雨，我一定遵照毛主席的指示办事，挑起这副重担子。”从此，陈老师的工作干劲越来越大，劳动时，总是抢做重活累活。
    陈老师虽然干得很欢，受到大伙一片赞誉声，可是范大叔又发现了新问题。有一次，他趁着陈老师呆在房间里，独自修理桌椅、板凳的机会，动员了队里的社员、民兵和年龄大的学生来到学校，人多力量大，半天工夫便修好、做好百多张桌和凳。陈老师高兴得不知如何感谢范大叔。范巨高又拿出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，拉着陈老师坐了下来，认真地学习“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识”这一段毛主席语录，并说道：“毛主席教导我们要走群众路线，这一条可是紧要。俗话说：‘人心齐，泰山移’，单枪匹马难成气候啊！”
    老贫农范巨高三次找陈老师谈话，每一次都深深地触动他的灵魂。陈老师说：“贫下中农对毛主席最热爱，范大叔三次找我谈话，胜读十几年书。”　　　　粤兵
