At half past eight in the evening on November 1, the radio broadcast a thrilling piece of news: the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had been issued. Instantly, the Baotou Mining Bureau's Dazhaizi Mine area was filled with jubilation. The revolutionary committee immediately formed a team to spread the joyous news to every worker in the underground operations. At that time, the coal miners working underground, following Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production," were engaged in intense labor. Upon hearing that the great leader Chairman Mao had personally presided over the successful conclusion of the Party's Twelfth Plenum and the issuance of the plenum's communiqué, everyone spontaneously raised their arms and cheered: "Long live the great Chinese Communist Party! Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The workers then turned their backs to the coal sea and faced the coal face, setting up a battlefield to denounce the traitor Liu Shaoqi. Old worker Qiao Lishui angrily said: "The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, long ago betrayed the interests of the working class and became a disgraceful traitor to the working class! During the Cultural Revolution, we exposed his counter-revolutionary face, and now he has been permanently expelled from the Party. This is a great cause for rejoicing, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" Worker Gao Chengxi followed with a speech: "Liu Shaoqi is a faithful running dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries buried within our Party. For many years, this fellow has committed countless crimes, ten thousand evils, and we must deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminating all the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" The workers all eagerly took turns to speak, each word ringing with force, like daggers piercing the black heart of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi!

The joyous team left. The comrades in the first mining area began a new battle. The coal miners, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, are determined to respond to the great call of the communiqué with actual actions of increased production!

At midnight, the office of the revolutionary committee was brightly lit, and the committee members were still seriously studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and researching measures for its implementation. Suddenly, the telephone rang urgently. The head of the revolutionary committee picked up the receiver and heard the other party excitedly say: "We report to Chairman Mao with joy! Joy! Our mine today produced 953 tons, exceeding the plan by 27%!" The comrades participating in the study responded with boundless enthusiasm: "Let us closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, respond to the great calls of the communiqué, and advance victoriously!"

    以新的生产成绩向毛主席报喜
    十一月一日晚八点半，广播里传来激动人心的喜讯：党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。顿时，包头矿务局大磁矿区一片欢腾。矿革委会为了把这一特大喜讯迅速传给井下作业的每个工人，立即组成了报喜队赶到了作业现场。当时，在井下作业的采煤工人，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，正在紧张劳动。一听说伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的党的十二中全会胜利闭幕了，全会公报发表了，大家情不自禁地振臂欢呼：“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    接着工人们背靠煤海，面对掌子面摆开了声讨工贼刘少奇的战场。老工人乔利水愤怒地说：“党内头号走资派刘少奇，很早以前就出卖了工人阶级的利益，成了工人阶级的可耻叛徒！文化大革命中我们揭露了他的反革命面貌，这次把他永远开除出党，真是大快人心的好事，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！”工人高成喜接着发言说：“刘少奇是埋在我们党内的帝修反的忠实走狗，多年以来，这个家伙罪恶累累，十恶不赦，我们要深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清工贼刘少奇的一切反革命修正主义流毒！”工人们个个争相发言，句句铿锵有力，象一把把匕首直刺大叛徒刘少奇的黑心窝！
    报喜队走了。一采区的同志们开始了新的战斗。无限忠于毛主席的煤矿工人决心用加紧生产的实际行动响应公报的伟大号召！
    午夜，矿革委会办公室里灯火通明，委员们还在认真学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，研究贯彻落实的措施。突然，电话铃急促地响了。革委会主任拿起听筒，只听对方激动地说：“我们向毛主席报喜！报喜！我矿今天日产量九百五十三吨，超额完成计划百分之二十七！”参加学习的同志们豪情满怀地回答：“让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，响应公报的各项伟大号召，乘胜前进！”忠东文
