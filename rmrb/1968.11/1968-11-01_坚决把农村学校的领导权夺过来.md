Chairman Mao's latest directive on "in rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" has been met with great joy by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao is closest to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are closest to Chairman Mao. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, our brigade immediately sent representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the primary school, organize students and teachers to resume classes and make revolution, and lead the school in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

However, a handful of class enemies are terrified and enraged by the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools. They hide in dark corners, spread rumors, and shoot poisoned arrows, using every possible means to disrupt and sabotage the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, strongly opposing the education revolution. They shamelessly shout: "The poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is actually interfering with the Cultural Revolution in schools, driving away all intellectuals, and persecuting them all." Some maliciously slander: "The poor and lower-middle peasants can manage their own hoes, and if they can manage production, that's good enough. 'Roughnecks' can't hold the pen, and the poor and lower-middle peasants can't teach students!"

Put away your tricks! Today, rural schools belong to us, the poor and lower-middle peasants! We not only want to "interfere" with the Cultural Revolution in rural schools but also want to seize all educational power from the bourgeois intellectuals and manage the schools ourselves. We deeply understand: if the poor and lower-middle peasants only hold the hoe but not the pen, they cannot truly achieve liberation.

Chairman Mao said: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are the most reliable allies of the working class and the main force of the rural education revolution. We must brandish the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, take up the iron broom, and drive away all the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who have infiltrated the schools, and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat over them. We will unite and educate revolutionary teachers and students, and together, we will completely abolish the old educational system! With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we are clear-sighted, brave, and resolute. We dare to poke the "wasp's nest," chew on "hard bones," and tackle "old difficulties." We not only want to manage the heavens, the earth, and the hoes well but also want to manage the schools and the pens well! And we will definitely manage them well.

In recent times, the series of investigative reports published in the newspapers about the poor and lower-middle peasants managing rural schools have fully demonstrated the great power of the poor and lower-middle peasants in seizing cultural power, effectively refuting the class enemies who conspire to sabotage the rural education revolution.

The poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is a great education revolution. Since it is a revolution, there will inevitably be resistance. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," use the spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought to blow open the lid of class struggle, and follow Chairman Mao's educational line to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural schools. We will complete the great historical mission entrusted to us by the great leader Chairman Mao and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front in rural areas!

    坚决把农村学校的领导权夺过来
    毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示发表后，广大贫下中农个个欢欣鼓舞。毛主席和贫下中农最亲，贫下中农跟毛主席最紧。我们队在人民解放军的大力支持下，立即派出贫下中农代表管理小学，组织学生、教师复课闹革命，领导学校的斗、批、改，受到了广大革命师生的热烈欢迎。
    但是，一小撮阶级敌人对贫下中农管理学校怕得要死，恨得要命。他们躲在阴暗的角落里，煽阴风，点鬼火，造谣言，放暗箭，千方百计干扰和破坏伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，极力反对教育革命。他们无耻地叫嚷：“贫下中农管理学校，实际上是要来干涉学校的文化大革命，是要把知识分子统统赶走，统统整掉。”有的恶毒污蔑说：“贫下中农能管好自己的锄头柄，搞好生产就算好了，‘大老粗’掌不了笔杆，贫下中农教不了学生！”
    还是收起你那一套吧！今日农村学校的天下是我们贫下中农的天下！我们不但要“干涉”农村学校的文化大革命，还要把农村教育大权从资产阶级知识分子手里统统夺过来，由我们贫下中农来管理学校。我们深深懂得：贫下中农只掌握锄头柄，不掌握笔杆子，就不能真正得到翻身。
    毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”我们贫下中农是工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，是农村教育革命的主力军。我们就是要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，拿起铁扫帚，把混进学校的一小撮国民党反动派残渣余孽统统赶走，并且对他们实行无产阶级专政，团结和教育革命师生，共同努力，把旧的教育制度统统废除！我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引，心明眼亮，胆壮志坚，我们敢捅“马蜂窝”，能啃“硬骨头”，能攻“老大难”。我们不但要管天管地管好锄把子，也要管好学校管好笔杆子！而且一定能管好。
    最近以来，报上连续发表的关于贫下中农管理农村学校的一系列调查报告，充分显示了贫下中农掌握文权的巨大力量，有力地回击了阴谋破坏农村教育革命的阶级敌人。
    贫下中农管理学校，这是一场伟大的教育革命。既然是革命，必然有反抗。我们决心遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用毛泽东思想精神原子弹，炸开阶级斗争的盖子，沿着毛主席的教育路线，认真搞好农村学校的斗、批、改，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的伟大历史使命，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高飘扬在农村教育阵地！
