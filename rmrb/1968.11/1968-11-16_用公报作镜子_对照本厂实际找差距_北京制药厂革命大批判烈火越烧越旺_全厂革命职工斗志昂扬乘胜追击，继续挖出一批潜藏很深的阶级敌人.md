The Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has used the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as a weapon to fully mobilize the masses and carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism. This has significantly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among revolutionary workers, strongly promoting the deepening of the struggle against the enemy and exposing a batch of deeply hidden class enemies.

This factory was a "model" factory for the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee to carry out capitalist restoration. The counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and his agent in Beijing, Peng Zhen, have deeply poisoned this factory, making the class struggle extremely complex. In the previous phase of the struggle against the enemy, the broad revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, conducted a thorough exposure, denunciation, and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi, Peng Zhen, and their agents in the factory. They exposed a batch of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries.

Just as they were summarizing the previous phase of work and preparing to advance further, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued. The Revolutionary Committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately organized the broad revolutionary workers to launch a wave of intensive study and extensive propaganda. Everyone used the communiqué as a mirror to compare with the work of revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks within the factory, identifying significant gaps. Everyone felt that in the previous phase, the mobilization of the masses was not deep enough, and the lid of class struggle had not been completely lifted. Some people had an insufficient understanding of the complexity of the struggle against hidden class enemies. The main reason for these problems was that the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" had not been completely eradicated. The broad revolutionary workers expressed their determination to respond to the call to arms of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly cleanse the class ranks, and to resolutely expose all the counter-revolutionaries hiding among the workers.

Under the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad revolutionary workers were more widely mobilized. Everyone spoke out and wrote articles, and the entire factory quickly launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as weapons to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." The revolutionary criticism further aroused the revolutionary workers' hatred towards the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi and the handful of class enemies in the factory, and strengthened their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Many old workers engaged in face-to-face struggles with class enemies, immediately exposing the reactionary remarks spread by a handful of class enemies to cover themselves up, such as "cleansing the class ranks is just a passing breeze" and "the pharmaceutical factory only has factional struggles, not class struggles." Because the criticism was closely linked to the actual class struggle in the factory, Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" was criticized to the point of being unbearable. The Pill Coating Workshop, with over 90% female workers, had always emphasized "sisterly harmony." After the revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness and awareness of class struggle among the female workers were raised. Even those who had previously paid little attention to class struggle actively participated in the criticism and engaged in face-to-face struggles with the enemy.

On the basis of deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and raising the masses' awareness of the enemy situation, the Revolutionary Committee and the Propaganda Team led the broad masses to launch a fierce attack on a handful of hidden class enemies. Various workshops launched the "three major" activities: exposing unusual phenomena, problems, events, and remarks in the workshop and team movements; tracing the causes and roots of the "four unusuals"; and investigating clues to clarify the targets of attack. The more they exposed, the clearer their eyes became, and the higher their fighting spirit soared. The Tablet Workshop had previously not paid attention to some people's activities of traveling and sightseeing. After launching the "three major" activities, they discovered that these people were engaged in counter-revolutionary connections. After tracing the roots, they exposed a counter-revolutionary clique, lifting the lid of class struggle in this workshop, and solving the long-standing "difficult" problem of the movement not being able to deepen. After a few days of intense struggle, the entire factory exposed another batch of deeply hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

At present, under the radiant guidance of the communiqué of the plenary session, the broad revolutionary workers of the entire factory are carrying forward the spirit of thorough revolution, advancing with victory, and are determined to fully implement and carry out the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, striving for double victories in revolution and production.

　　用公报作镜子　对照本厂实际找差距
　　北京制药厂革命大批判烈火越烧越旺
　　全厂革命职工斗志昂扬乘胜追击，继续挖出一批潜藏很深的阶级敌人
    本报讯　北京制药厂革委会，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为武器，充分发动群众，深入展开革命大批判，大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了对敌斗争的深入发展，挖出了一批埋藏很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。
    这个厂是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团搞资本主义复辟的一个“样板”厂，刘少奇和他在北京市的代理人彭真等的反革命修正主义思想在这个厂流毒很深，阶级斗争极为复杂。在前一段对敌斗争中，广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，以班、组为单位，对刘少奇、彭真和他们在本厂的代理人的反革命修正主义思想进行了大揭发、大控诉、大批判，挖出了一批叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和反革命分子。
    正当他们总结前一段工作，准备乘胜前进的时候，党的八届十二中全会公报发表了。革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队当夜组织广大革命职工迅速掀起一个大学习，大宣传的热潮。大家以公报为镜子，对照厂内大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，狠找差距。大家认为，前一阶段发动群众不够深入，阶级斗争盖子还没有完全揭开；有的人对同暗藏的阶级敌人作斗争的复杂性认识不足。所以存在这些问题，主要是刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的流毒还没有完全肃清。广大革命职工表示：坚决响应党的八届十二中全会的战斗号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，认真搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，坚决把混在职工群众中的一小撮反革命分子统统挖出来。
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，广大革命职工更广泛地发动起来了，人人口诛笔伐，全厂迅速掀起革命大批判的新高潮。他们以毛主席的最新指示、党的八届十二中全会公报为武器，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。革命大批判进一步激发了革命职工对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和厂里一小撮阶级敌人的仇恨，增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。许多老工人同阶级敌人展开了面对面的斗争，当场揭发了一小撮阶级敌人为了掩护自己所散布的“清理阶级队伍是一阵风”、“制药厂只有宗派斗争，没有阶级斗争”等反动言论。由于大批判紧密联系本厂阶级斗争的实际，把刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”批得臭不可闻。胶丸车间百分之九十以上是女同志，一向以“姐妹和气”为重。经过革命大批判，提高了女工们的阶级和阶级斗争观念，一些平时不大关心阶级斗争的女工，也积极参加大批判，和敌人展开面对面的斗争。
    在深入开展革命大批判，提高群众敌情观念的基础上，革委会和宣传队率领广大群众，向一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻。各车间纷纷开展了“三大”活动：大摆本车间、班组运动中的怪现象，怪问题，怪事，怪言论；大追“四怪”的原因和根源；大查线索，明确打击重点。大家越摆眼睛越亮，越摆斗志越高。片剂车间原来对有的人游山玩水没有引起注意，开展“三大”活动后，发现他们是在搞反革命串连，经过追根寻底，结果挖出了一个反革命小集团，揭开了这个车间的阶级斗争盖子，解决了过去运动深入不下去的“老大难”问题。经过短短几天的激烈战斗，全厂又挖出了一批潜藏很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。
    目前，全厂广大革命职工在全会公报的光辉照耀下，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，决心全面贯彻、落实公报提出的各项战斗任务，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。　国库　永春　瀛洲
