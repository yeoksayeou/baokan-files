The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Mali, Liu He Lin, recently hosted a reception to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mali and the fourth anniversary of the signing of the China-Mali Friendship Treaty. Over a hundred Mali guests attended the reception, including members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Assembly Yakuba M'Gha, Minister of Justice and Labor Madera Keita, Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Bakary Diallo, Director of the Presidential Office Tijani Guisse, and other high-ranking officials, representatives from various sectors of Bamako, and Mali friends who had visited China.

The reception was held in a friendly and warm atmosphere. Yakuba M'Gha, at the reception, wished for further development of Mali-China friendship and for the strengthening of the anti-imperialist struggle.

During the reception, a Chinese color documentary film "Piano Accompaniment to 'The Red Lantern'" was screened, which was warmly received by the Mali friends. They applauded enthusiastically during the screening. Many friends congratulated the Chinese revolutionary artists for their great success in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the field of Peking opera piano accompaniment. A Mali friend said: Chairman Mao's instruction of "ancient for the present, foreign for the Chinese" is absolutely correct. The piano accompaniment and Peking opera singing are well coordinated. This great success is due to the great thought of Chairman Mao.
