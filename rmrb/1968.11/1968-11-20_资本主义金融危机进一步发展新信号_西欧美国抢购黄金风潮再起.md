In recent days, the franc, pound, and dollar have all seen significant devaluations. Over the past half year, not only have the pound and dollar been weak and sluggish, but the franc has also fallen into peril, reflecting the severe ailments of the capitalist monetary system.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: Amidst the worsening fiscal and economic conditions in major capitalist countries, a new wave of selling paper currency and buying gold has swept through the financial centers of Western Europe and the United States. This is a further development of the most severe financial crisis in forty years that erupted in the capitalist world this past spring. It has dealt a new and heavy blow to the already precarious capitalist world monetary system.

This new wave, which has engulfed the major financial centers of the West, began a week ago with the selling of the franc, quickly spreading to the already weak pound and dollar. In the financial markets of Western Europe and the United States, merchants have been dumping francs, pounds, and dollars, and rushing to buy gold and the relatively stable West German mark. The price of gold has risen to over $40 per ounce (the official price is $35); the franc's exchange rate has fallen below the officially set minimum; the pound's exchange rate has dropped to its lowest point since devaluation; and the dollar's price has been continuously falling. It is reported that over the past week, at least $10 billion worth of francs, pounds, and dollars have been sold in the German foreign exchange market (with francs accounting for about half). On the 15th alone, $2 billion worth of francs flowed out of France, exchanged for gold or West German marks in the financial markets of Western Europe.

Rumors about the imminent devaluation of the franc and other speculations have spread rapidly in the financial centers, intensifying the selling and buying frenzy, which reached its peak on the 15th. Banks in West Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium had to limit the amount of francs they accepted; some airports and hotels in Western Europe temporarily refused to accept franc payments. This frenzy is far from over.

It is not coincidental that, just eight months after the gold-buying frenzy in the capitalist world this past spring, the currency system of the West has once again been strongly impacted. This fact fundamentally reflects the deepening of the overall political and economic crisis of capitalism. Despite the efforts of American imperialism and its Western European allies to struggle and prop up the situation, they have not been able to change the fundamentally deteriorating condition of the Western world's currency system. Over the past half year, not only have the pound and dollar remained weak, but another major currency of the capitalist world—the franc—has also fallen into peril, triggering the current new wave of gold buying. All of this indicates that the capitalist world's currency system is already in a state of severe deterioration, on the brink of collapse.

　　资本主义金融危机进一步发展新信号
　　西欧美国抢购黄金风潮再起
    连日来法郎、英镑、美元大跌价。半年多来不仅英镑美元虚弱不振，法郎也陷入险境，反映资本主义货币体系已病入膏肓
    新华社十九日讯　在各主要资本主义国家的财政经济不断恶化的情况下，最近在西欧和美国的各金融中心，再一次刮起了一股抛售纸币，抢购黄金的风潮。这是今年春天爆发的资本主义世界四十年来最严重的金融危机的进一步发展。它给了处境岌岌可危的资本主义世界货币体系以新的沉重打击。
    席卷西方各主要金融中心的这场新的风潮是在一周前由抛售法郎开始的，接着很快就波及原来地位就十分虚弱的英镑和美元。在西欧和美国的金融市场上，商人纷纷抛出法郎、英镑和美元，抢购黄金以及相对来说地位比较稳定的西德马克。黄金价格涨到了每盎司四十美元以上（官价是三十五美元）；法郎牌价跌到了官方规定的最低水平以下；英镑牌价降到了贬值以来的最低点；美元价格也不断下跌。据透露，一周来，在西德的外汇市场上抛售的法郎、英镑和美元就至少价值十亿美元左右（其中法郎约占一半）；仅仅十五日一天，就有价值两亿美元的法郎流出法国，在西欧各金融市场上换成黄金或西德马克。
    有关法郎即将贬值和其他的种种估计在各金融中心迅速流传，这使得这股抛风和抢风越刮越猛，在十五日达到了高潮。西德、瑞士和比利时等国的银行不得不限制收进法郎的数量；一些西欧的机场和旅馆一度拒绝接受法郎付款。目前这一风潮还远远没有过去。
    在今年春天资本主义世界的抢购黄金风潮之后，相隔不过八个月，西方世界的货币体系再次受到强烈的冲击决不是偶然的，这个事实从根本上反映了资本主义政治经济总危机的进一步加深。尽管美帝国主义一直在纠集它的西欧娄罗竭力进行挣扎，支撑危局，但是未能改变西方世界货币体系百孔千疮的根本状况。半年多来，不仅英镑和美元继续处于虚弱地位，而且又有另一种资本主义世界的主要货币——法郎陷入了险境，并因此触发了当前新的抢购黄金浪潮。这一切表明，资本主义世界货币体系已经到了病入膏肓，濒于崩溃的地步。
