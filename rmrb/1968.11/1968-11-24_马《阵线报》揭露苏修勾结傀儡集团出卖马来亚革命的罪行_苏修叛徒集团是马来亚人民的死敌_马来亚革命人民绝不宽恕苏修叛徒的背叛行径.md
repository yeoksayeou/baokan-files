The Malayan "Frontline News" recently published an article exposing the treacherous nature of the Soviet revisionist clique in colluding with the American and British imperialists' lackey, the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet regime, to betray the revolutionary struggle of the Malayan people.

The article states that the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, taught us: "Whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." The article says that on November 7, the Soviet revisionist ambassador to "Malaysia," Kuznetsov, shamelessly went to the "Malaysian Radio Station" to deliver a speech, claiming that he was "grateful" for the "assistance and goodwill" provided by "Malaysia" to the Soviet embassy in Malaysia. He blatantly declared that "the Soviet Union and 'Malaysia' have opened new institutions to promote mutual beneficial trade, economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation, and to foster mutual understanding, trust, and friendly relations between the two governments and peoples." And so on, once again whitewashing the neo-colonialist nature of "Malaysia."

The article points out: "Everyone knows that Rahman and Razak are the vanguards of anti-communism and anti-people in Southeast Asia. Today, they actually allow a so-called 'socialist country' to use their radio station to commemorate the October Socialist Revolution. Isn't this a clear exposure of the counter-revolutionary ugly face of the Soviet revisionist clique? Doesn't this clearly show that the Soviet revisionist clique and the Rahman puppet regime have a common language and are getting along very well? Isn't this clear evidence of the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the international proletarian revolution and sabotage of the Malayan people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle?"

The article says: "Since the Soviet revisionist leadership betrayed the October Revolution, betrayed the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, betrayed the Soviet revolutionary people and the world revolutionary movement, and degenerated into modern revisionists, they have been colluding with the Rahman puppet regime. This year, they even established diplomatic relations with 'Malaysia' and invited the leaders of the Rahman regime, including Razak, to Moscow to further discuss the Soviet revisionist clique's political, economic, and military infiltration of Malaya. They openly and directly provide military aid (including weapons, various war materials, and military personnel training) to the Rahman puppet regime, vigorously helping the Rahman puppet regime suppress the revolutionary armed struggles of the Malayan and North Borneo peoples. This fully exposes the fact that the Soviet revisionist clique stands completely on the counter-revolutionary side."

The article points out that the facts are clear: Kuznetsov's radio speech once again exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitors to the Malayan people, further illustrating that the Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with the Rahman puppet regime, is intensifying the sabotage of the Malayan people's revolutionary struggle. The Soviet revisionist clique has become the mortal enemy of the Malayan people.

The article concludes by emphasizing that the Malayan revolutionary people will not allow the Soviet revisionist clique's evil behavior to continue, and will not forgive their shameless betrayal. We must take practical actions to give a powerful blow to the Soviet revisionist clique.

    马《阵线报》揭露苏修勾结傀儡集团出卖马来亚革命的罪行
    苏修叛徒集团是马来亚人民的死敌
    马来亚革命人民绝不宽恕苏修叛徒的背叛行径
    新华社二十三日讯　在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近发表文章，揭露苏修叛徒集团勾结美英帝国主义的走狗“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团，出卖马来亚人民革命斗争的叛徒嘴脸。
    文章说，世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席教导我们：“什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”文章说，十一月七日，苏修驻“马来西亚大使”库兹涅佐夫竟然跑到“马来西亚广播电台”发表谈话，无耻地说什么“对‘马来西亚’给苏联驻马大使馆的协助与良善的态度”“表示感激”，公然叫嚷什么“苏联和‘马来西亚’已经开辟新的机构以促进双方互惠的贸易、经济、科学与文化合作，并促进两国政府与人民之间的相互了解、信赖与友善关系。”如此等等，再一次为“马来西亚”的新殖民主义性质涂脂抹粉。
    文章指出：“谁都知道，拉赫曼与拉扎克是东南亚反共反人民的急先锋。今天，他们竟然允许一个所谓‘社会主义国家’，利用他们的电台纪念十月社会主义革命，这不是再清楚不过地戳穿了苏修集团的反革命丑恶面目吗？这不正好说明苏修叛徒集团与拉赫曼傀儡集团有了共同的语言，而又搞得火热吗？这不是苏修叛徒集团背叛国际无产阶级革命，破坏马来亚人民反帝反封建革命斗争的明显罪证吗？”
    文章说：“自从苏修领导集团背叛了十月革命，背叛了无产阶级革命与无产阶级专政，背叛苏联革命人民和世界革命运动，堕落成为现代修正主义者以后，就一直和拉赫曼傀儡政权勾勾搭搭。今年，竟然与‘马来西亚’建立外交关系，并邀请拉赫曼政权的头目拉扎克前往莫斯科，进一步商讨苏修叛徒集团对马来亚进行政治、经济和军事的渗透，公开地、直接地对拉赫曼傀儡政权提供军事援助（其中包括提供军火、各种战争物资和训练军事人员）、极力帮助拉赫曼傀儡政权镇压马来亚与北加里曼丹人民的革命武装斗争。这充分暴露了苏修集团完全站在反革命方面。”
    文章指出，事实昭然若揭，库兹涅佐夫的广播谈话，再一次将苏修叛徒的丑恶嘴脸赤裸裸地暴露在马来亚人民面前，进一步说明了苏修叛徒集团伙同拉赫曼傀儡集团加紧破坏马来亚人民的革命斗争。苏修叛徒集团已经成为马来亚人民的死敌。
    文章最后强调说，马来亚革命人民绝不容许苏修叛徒集团破坏马来亚革命的罪恶行为继续下去，绝不会宽恕他们这样无耻的背叛行径。我们必须以实际的行动给予苏修叛徒集团以有力的打击。
