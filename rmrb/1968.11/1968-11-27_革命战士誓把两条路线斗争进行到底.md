In the midst of the nationwide fervor of deeply studying and earnestly implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the epoch-making Marxist-Leninist document—the great leader Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"—has been reissued.

On the evening of the 24th, we listened to the broadcast with excited hearts. The entire company immediately held a celebration meeting. Everyone repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

In March 1949, our company was honored to undertake the security task for the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee. After the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee ended, our company was again honored to undertake the security task for the great leader Chairman Mao. We followed Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to Beijing and were awarded a red banner by the military leadership, which read, "The most glorious defense of Chairman Mao." For nineteen years, our company has been stationed in Beijing. Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee has always guided our direction.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: The lessons of history are worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses. Long-term revolutionary struggle has made us deeply understand that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of our Party and our army, and the lifeblood of revolutionary soldiers. We can die, we can shed blood, but we cannot abandon Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our company has repeatedly and seriously studied this brilliant work by Chairman Mao. We discuss Chairman Mao's revolutionary line year after year, month after month, and day after day, constantly improving the awareness of the entire company in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing vigorously promoted the bourgeois military line and fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fought selflessly, fearlessly, bravely, and resolutely against them. We unconditionally implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian military line of first and foremost building the army politically, thoroughly smashing their anti-party and anti-military conspiracies.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee. Chairman Mao taught us: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." The counter-revolutionary Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices are the enemies without guns who have infiltrated our Party.

The reissuing of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the report to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee is a battle order from the proletarian headquarters to the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel nationwide to carry out the struggle between the two lines to the end. We revolutionary soldiers will carry out and implement this order without exception. We will definitely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," earnestly study the history of the struggle between the two lines, and grasp the education on the struggle between the two lines. We will constantly improve our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We will definitely closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose the crimes of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices of betraying the Party and the country, closely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and carry out the struggle between the two lines to the end!

    革命战士誓把两条路线斗争进行到底
    人民解放军北京卫戍区某部一连
    在全国亿万军民深入学习和认真落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的热潮中，具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义文献——伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》重新发表了。
    二十四日晚上，我们怀着激动的心情收听了广播，全连指战员立即举行庆祝会，大家一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    一九四九年三月，我们连光荣地担负了党的七届二中全会的警卫任务。七届二中全会结束以后，我们连又光荣地担负了警卫伟大领袖毛主席的任务，跟随毛主席、党中央到了北京，荣获部队领导机关授予的“保卫毛主席最光荣”的鲜红锦旗。十九年来，我们连一直守卫在北京。毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，永远指引着我们前进的方向。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。长期的革命斗争实践使我们深深懂得：毛主席的革命路线，是我党我军的生命线，是革命战士的命根子。头可断，血可流，毛主席的革命路线不能丢。为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我们连反复地认真地学习了毛主席的这篇光辉著作，对于毛主席的革命路线，我们年年讲、月月讲、天天讲，不断提高全连指战员捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。在刘少奇以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿竭力推行资产阶级军事路线，疯狂反对毛主席的革命路线时，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，最无私、最无畏、最勇敢、最坚定地同他们展开了坚决的斗争，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席首先和着重从政治上建军的无产阶级建军路线，彻底粉碎了他们的反党篡军阴谋。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们认真学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告。毛主席教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”反革命分子刘少奇及其同伙，就是钻进我们党内的不拿枪的敌人。
    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的发表和《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的重新发表，是无产阶级司令部向全国亿万军民发出的把两条路线斗争进行到底的战斗号令。我们革命战士一千个执行，一万个照办。我们一定遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，狠抓两条路线斗争教育，不断提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。我们一定要紧密团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续深入地开展革命大批判，彻底清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，把两条路线斗争进行到底！　（据新华社）
