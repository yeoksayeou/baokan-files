The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhangjiakou Medical College has helped medical staff to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, eradicate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the medical and health sector, and establish the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. The entire hospital has quickly taken on a new look of enthusiastically serving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhangjiakou Medical College is responsible for the medical work of thirteen counties. However, for a long time, a handful of stubborn reactionaries have colluded with traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, seizing control of the hospital's leadership, promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's "authoritative management of schools" and "experts running hospitals," and establishing a set of unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the medical staff and prevent them from serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the hospital exposed a handful of reactionaries and class enemies, and reformed some unreasonable rules and regulations. However, due to the deep influence of bourgeois ideology and the strong old habits, the hospital's struggle, criticism, and reform are far behind the requirements of the situation.

After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the hospital, they saw some strange phenomena: some people could talk a good game theoretically, but their actual work was another matter, and their attitude towards patients was not good. Because of the lack of beds, some patients who came from far away to seek treatment had to stay in hotels for a long time before they could be admitted to the hospital, and some who were admitted had to stay in the corridors, while doctors and nurses were working in the rooms. The workers of the propaganda team and the PLA soldiers were very saddened by this, and many of them said excitedly, "We would rather sleep on the floor or in the open air than let our poor and lower-middle peasant brothers suffer." They immediately moved out of the building and moved the poor and lower-middle peasant patients into the rooms.

They set an example in action and then conducted meticulous ideological and political work among the medical staff. With the help of the PLA comrades stationed in the hospital, the workers' propaganda team organized the medical staff of various departments to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively study and apply the "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's great directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." In the study classes, many old workers recalled the bitter history of being exploited and oppressed by landlords and capitalists in the old society, expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and discussed their experiences in promoting ideological revolutionization, fighting the revolution, and promoting production under the nurturing of Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles," together with the medical staff to criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and educate the medical staff to establish the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and selflessly dedicating themselves to the people. Many medical staff members deeply felt that they had read the "Old Three Articles" many times and could recite them as well as others, but they were far from applying them, just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Some people have read some Marxist books and think they have knowledge, but they have not really read them, and they have not taken root in their minds, and they cannot apply them. Their class feelings are still old."

Under the inspiration and education of the workers' propaganda team and the PLA soldiers, the broad revolutionary masses of the hospital fought against selfishness and revisionism, and revitalized their revolutionary spirit. The medical staff of the External Medicine Department first vacated the office and duty room as wards, and worked in the corridors themselves. In a few days, the entire hospital increased sixty-five beds, and also set up some simple beds. The medical staff also improved their service attitude, carefully treated and cared for the patients; the hospital's catering staff, according to the severity of the patients' conditions and living habits, reformed the previous "foreign menu," and lowered the charging standards.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has not been in the hospital for long, but the hospital's appearance has changed significantly. Many patients, after seeing this, excitedly said: The workers' propaganda team entered the hospital according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and we are very happy. Without the leadership of the working class and the participation of the PLA, the old-fashioned hospital in the city cannot change its appearance! Many medical staff members also said: The workers' propaganda team has high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and set a good example for us to thoroughly change our world outlook. The living facts make us deeply feel that the working class must not only lead the hospital but also be able to lead the hospital well.

　　张家口医学专科学校第一附属医院在工人宣传队和解放军同志帮助下
　　出现热情为贫下中农服务的新风尚
    据新华社石家庄电　进驻张家口市医学专科学校第一附属医院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助医护人员活学活用毛主席著作，肃清党内头号走资派刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想在医疗卫生战线上的流毒，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，使全院迅速出现了热情为广大贫下中农服务的新面貌。
    张家口医学专科学校第一附属医院担负着十三个县的医疗工作。但是长期以来，一小撮顽固不化的走资派勾结叛徒、特务、国民党反动派的残渣余孽，把持着医院的领导大权，推行大叛徒刘少奇的
  “权威治校”、“专家办院”等反革命修正主义路线，建立一整套不合理的规章制度，束缚医护人员的手脚，不为贫下中农服务。在无产阶级文化大革命中，医院的革命群众揪出了一小撮走资派和叛徒、特务等阶级敌人，改革了一些不合理的规章制度，但是由于资产阶级思想的影响相当深，旧的习惯势力相当大，医院的斗、批、改远远落后于形势的要求。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻医院以后，看到了一些怪现象：某些人理论讲得呱呱叫，实际工作却是另一套，对病人的态度不大好。因为床位不够，有些病人远道来治病要住在旅馆里等上很长时间才能住院，有的住院了，却只能住在走廊上，而医生、护士却在屋子里办公。工人宣传队的工人们和解放军指战员对此非常痛心，许多人激动地说：“我们宁肯自己睡在地板上，睡在露天里，也不能让贫下中农兄弟受委屈。”他们立刻从楼房搬出来，把贫下中农病人从楼道搬进去。
    他们在行动上做出了榜样，接着对医护人员进行细致的思想政治工作。在驻医院解放军同志的帮助下，工人宣传队组织各科室的医护人员分别办起了毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席
  “把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示。在学习班里，许多老工人回忆了在旧社会受尽地主、资本家剥削压迫的苦难家史，倾诉了无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席、无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想、无限热爱毛主席无产阶级革命路线的心情，畅谈自己在毛主席的“老三篇”的哺育下，促进思想革命化，狠抓革命，猛促生产的体会，和医护人员一起批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，教育医护人员树立全心全意为人民服务、毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神。许多医护人员深有感慨地说：“老三篇”我们读过多少遍，背起来不比别人差，但是用起来却差得多，正如毛主席所指出的那样：“有些人读了一些马克思主义的书，自以为有学问了，但是并没有读进去，并没有在头脑里生根，不会应用，阶级感情还是旧的。”
    在工人宣传队和解放军指战员言传身带的启发教育下，医院广大革命群众狠狠地斗私批修，振奋起革命精神。外一科的医护人员首先腾出了办公室和值班室作为病房，自己在楼道里工作。几天时间，全院就增加了六十五张病床，另外还增设了一些简易病床。医护人员又改进了服务态度，精心治疗和护理病人；医院的炊事人员根据病人的病情轻重和生活习惯，改革过去的“洋食谱”，降低了收费标准。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻医院时间不长，医院的面貌就发生了明显的变化。许多病人看了激动地说：工人宣传队遵照毛主席的教导进驻医院，我们高兴极了。没有工人阶级的领导，没有解放军参加，城市老爷医院改变不了面貌！许多医护人员也说：工人宣传队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，为我们彻底改造世界观树立了好榜样。活生生的事实使我们深深体会到，工人阶级不但必须领导医院，而且能够领导好医院。
