The Indonesian fascist regime has engaged in a massive sellout. In the first nine months of this year, the total investment by foreign monopolistic capital in Indonesia has risen sharply. It is revealed that from January to May, the total foreign investment amounted to $150 million, which surged to $400 million by September. The number of investment projects increased from 36 in the first five months to 84, covering industries such as manufacturing, mining, forestry, fisheries, transportation, pharmaceuticals, and plantations. The main projects are aimed at plundering Indonesia's natural resources.

In mid-October, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime signed agreements with 16 foreign oil monopolies, selling off the country's resources. One of the contracts sold the oil resources in an area of 100,000 square kilometers in the northern part of West Kalimantan, including the Natuna Islands and the Anambas Islands, to the United States. Another agreement sold the oil resources in a 100,000 square kilometer coastal area of West Irian to Italy.

According to the contracts signed with the Indonesian fascist military regime, the amount of oil plundered by American oil monopolies from Indonesia has increased unprecedentedly. Just the amount of oil shipped by the American Standard Oil Company from Indonesia increased from 15,000 barrels in 1952 to 401,000 barrels in the first half of this year, an increase of nearly 27 times.

According to the Indonesian newspaper *Independence*, the Indonesian fascist military regime, in its desperate attempt to seek aid, has accumulated a massive foreign debt. By the end of this year, the total foreign debt will reach $420 million. If the foreign debts to be borrowed in the coming years are included, by 1973, Indonesia's foreign debt will exceed $700 million.

    印尼法西斯政权大卖国
    今年头九个月，外国垄断资本在印尼的投资总额直线上升。据透露，从一月到五月，外国投资总额为一亿五千万美元，到九月就突增到四亿美元。投资的项目由头五个月的三十六项猛增到八十四项，范围包括工业、矿业、林业、渔业、交通、制药和种植园等，其中主要的工程是用来掠夺印尼自然资源的。
    今年十月中，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权又同十六家外国石油垄断公司签订了卖国协定。其中一个合同把西加里曼丹北部纳土纳群岛和阿南巴斯群岛附近十万平方公里地区内的石油资源卖给了美国。另一个协定把西伊里安沿海十万平方公里地区内的石油资源卖给了意大利。
    根据同印尼法西斯军人政权签订的合同，美国石油垄断资本家从印尼掠夺的石油空前增加。仅美国德士古石油垄断公司从印尼运出的石油就由一九五二年的一万五千桶猛增到今年上半年的四十万一千桶，增加近二十七倍。
    据印尼《独立报》透露，印尼法西斯军人政权卖国求援，欠下累累外债。到今年年底，外债总额达四十二亿美元。如果加上今后几年再借的外债，到一九七三年印尼欠的外债将在七十亿美元以上。
