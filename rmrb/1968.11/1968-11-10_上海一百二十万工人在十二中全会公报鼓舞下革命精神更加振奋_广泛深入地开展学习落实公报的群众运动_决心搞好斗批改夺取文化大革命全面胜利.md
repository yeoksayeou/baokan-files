Shanghai's 1.2 million industrial workers, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, have further invigorated their revolutionary spirit. A widespread and in-depth mass movement to study and implement the communiqué has been launched. They are determined to carry out the "Three-in-One" struggle, seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 9 — The industrial workers of Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, are studying, propagating, resolutely implementing, and comprehensively implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee with the spirit of "seizing the day." Under the inspiration of the plenary session communiqué, a mass movement to carry out the "Three-in-One" struggle and welcome the Ninth National Congress of the Party has been launched in the city.

The working class of Shanghai has made great achievements in the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao. They joyfully and excitedly celebrate the success of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. After the communiqué of the 12th Plenum was issued, the working class of the entire city immediately placed the study and implementation of the plenary session communiqué at the forefront of all work. In the process of study, they reviewed the extremely complex and sharp struggles they had with the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pixin and Cao Qiqiu, and deeply understood the profound correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's recent pointing out that "this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has exposed the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, destroyed the bourgeois headquarters headed by Liu Shaoqi, tempered the broad revolutionary masses, and achieved unprecedented popularization of the great thought of Mao Zedong among the 700 million people. The achievements are truly the greatest. The working class of Shanghai discusses the great victories already achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their revolutionary spirit is more invigorated. They are determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao bravely forward, comprehensively implement the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

This time, the working class of Shanghai's study and implementation of the plenary session communiqué is not only swift and decisive but also solid and practical. From the day the communiqué was issued, many industrial bureaus, companies, factories, and workshops quickly organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes held in the metallurgy, machinery, textiles, light industry, and handicraft industries, the heads of the revolutionary committees of various factories and the heads of revolutionary mass organizations linked the progress of their factories' "Three-in-One" struggle with the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, summarized experiences, found gaps, and revised plans. Some members of the revolutionary committees of bureaus and factories also went down to the workshops and teams to organize study classes with the workers. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various units, people enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The study classes became the best classrooms for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers of many factories, such as Shanggang No. 1 Factory, Shanggang No. 3 Factory, Dongfanghong Shipyard, Shanggang No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Tool Factory, and China Clock Factory, studied and acted simultaneously, putting forward new and higher combat requirements for themselves with the spirit of "seizing the day." After revising the previous plans, the revolutionary and production of the entire Shanghai Tool Factory presented a new revolutionary scene in just a few days.

The decision of the 12th Plenum of the Party to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoke all his Party and non-Party positions, as well as the plenary session's serious criticism of the "February Countercurrent" in 1967 and the spring wind of reversing the "February Countercurrent," has received the most resolute support from the working class of Shanghai. In the past few days, the broad revolutionary workers of the city, with deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, have launched an even more powerful revolutionary criticism. Factories, docks, stations, trains, and ships are all battlefields for denouncing Liu Shaoqi. Workers respond to the call of the plenary session, verbally and in writing, fiercely exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "Six Articles" and other counter-revolutionary fallacies, determined to further cleanse the reactionary revisionist thought of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, from every field and corner. In the Minhang Industrial Zone of Shanghai, Liu Shaoqi had poisoned the area three times before the Cultural Revolution. After the communiqué was issued, the workers of Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory in this area immediately held denunciation meetings, using a large number of ironclad facts to angrily settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi's treasonous and counter-revolutionary crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. The workers of Shanggang No. 3 Factory, Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, and Factory 7029 said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Never forget class struggle.' We will criticize Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' counter-revolutionary crimes year after year, month after month, and day after day, and we will criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi until he is stinking and can never rise again."

The vigorous mass movement to study and implement the communiqué has promoted a high tide of the "Three-in-One" struggle throughout the city. After studying the communiqué, many factories are taking steps to establish "Mass Management Committees" based on teams and are determined to further carry out the work of cleaning up class ranks, streamlining organizations, and reforming unreasonable rules and regulations. Some factories have also selected outstanding workers and Communist Party members who firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to strengthen the leadership cadre, to consolidate, develop, and perfect the newly born revolutionary committees, so that they can better assume the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. On the basis of criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of managing enterprises, many factories are breaking old rules and regulations and breaking the frameworks set by reactionary technical "authorities" and "experts," fully unleashing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the worker masses. Now, the broad revolutionary workers are in a high fighting posture, grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to create even more outstanding achievements to welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    上海一百二十万工人在十二中全会公报鼓舞下革命精神更加振奋
    广泛深入地开展学习落实公报的群众运动
    决心搞好斗批改夺取文化大革命全面胜利
    新华社上海九日电　我国最大工业城市上海的一百二十万产业工人，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，认真学习、热情宣传、坚决贯彻、全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务。在全会公报的鼓舞下，一个搞好斗、批、改，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的群众运动，已在全市蓬勃展开。
    上海市的工人阶级在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，建立了丰功伟绩。他们怀着胜利的喜悦和无比激动的心情，最热烈地欢庆党的八届十二中全会的成功。十二中全会公报发表以后，全市工人阶级立即把学习、贯彻全会公报放在一切工作的首位。他们在学习过程中，回顾了两年来和叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流进行的极其复杂、极其尖锐的斗争，更加深刻地体会到伟大领袖毛主席最近指出的“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”这一教导的无比英明正确。由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，挖出了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙，摧毁了以刘少奇为首的资产阶级司令部，锻炼了广大革命群众，伟大的毛泽东思想在七亿人民中得到空前的大普及，成绩真是最大最大最大的。上海工人阶级畅谈无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大胜利，革命精神更加振奋，决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，全面落实公报提出的各项战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    上海工人阶级这次学习、落实全会公报的活动，不仅雷厉风行，而且扎扎实实。从公报发表的当天起，许多工业局、公司、工厂和车间，就迅速举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在冶金、机电、纺织、轻工、手工等行业所举办的学习班上，各厂革委会负责人和革命群众组织负责人联系本厂斗、批、改的进展情况，逐条、逐段地对照公报提出的各项战斗任务，总结经验，找出差距，修订规划。有些局、厂革委会成员还下到车间、班组，和工人一起办学习班。在各单位举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，人们热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，热情赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，学习班成了活学活用毛泽东思想最好的课堂。上钢一厂、上钢三厂、东方红造船厂、国棉十七厂、上海工具厂、中国钟厂等许多工厂的革命职工，边学习、边行动，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神给自己提出了更新更高的战斗要求。上海工具厂的革命职工修订了过去的规划后，短短几天全厂革命和生产就出现了一派崭新的革命景象。
    党的十二中全会关于把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的决定，以及全会对一九六七年“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案邪风的严肃批判，得到了上海工人阶级的最坚决的拥护。这几天来，全市广大革命职工怀着对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的无比仇恨，展开了声势更加浩大的革命大批判。工厂、码头、车站、列车、轮船到处是声讨刘少奇的战场。工人们响应全会号召，口诛笔伐，狠揭猛批刘少奇的“六论”等反革命谬论，决心进一步从各个领域、各个角落肃清党内头号走资派刘少奇的反革命修正主义的思想。在上海闵行工业区，文化大革命以前刘少奇曾三次到这里放毒。公报发表以后，这个地区的上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂的工人马上召开声讨大会，以大量铁的事实，愤怒清算刘少奇叛党叛国、大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。上钢三厂、上海柴油机厂、七○二九厂等工厂的工人说，毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，我们对刘少奇及其同伙的反革命罪行，就是要年年批、月月批、天天批，一定要把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇批得臭不可闻，叫他永世不得翻身。
    轰轰烈烈的学习、落实公报的群众运动，推动了全市的斗、批、改高潮。许多工厂学习公报后，都在着手建立以班组为基础的“群众管理委员会”，并且决心进一步搞好清理阶级队伍、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度等项工作。有些工厂还选拔了坚决执行毛主席革命路线的优秀工人和共产党员充实领导班子，以巩固、发展和完善新生的革命委员会，使它更好地担负起无产阶级专政的职能。在批判刘少奇的修正主义办企业路线基础上，不少工厂都在大破旧的规章制度，大破反动技术“权威”“专家”所设置的条条框框，工人群众的革命积极性得到了最充分的发挥。现在，广大革命职工正在以高昂的战斗姿态，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心创造出更加优异的成绩，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开。
