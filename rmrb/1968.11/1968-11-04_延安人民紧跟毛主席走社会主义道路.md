The joyous news of the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an on the evening of November 3. The people of Yan'an were overjoyed and excited. From the foothills of Fenghuang Mountain to inside and outside the Yan'an Garden, everywhere was a scene of jubilation. People were extremely excited, saying: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The people of Yan'an have a thousand words and ten thousand songs to express our gratitude, but we can never fully express your kindness. The heavens and the earth are not as great as your kindness, and parents are not as dear as you.

The old Red Army soldiers of the "August 1st" Elderly Home in Yan'an were overjoyed when the communiqué was published. They recalled the journey of following the great leader Chairman Mao from victory to victory. They said with great emotion: Thinking of the past and looking at today, every step forward on the revolutionary journey is due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership. Every victory is the crystallization of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Following Chairman Mao is the direction, following Chairman Mao is victory! Zhang Dequ, an old Red Army soldier who started the revolution with Chairman Mao at the age of ten, was extremely moved. He said, "We are in the elderly home, but our hearts are in Beijing. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. Even though we are old and weak, we will always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and never forget the word 'revolution.' As long as we have a breath, we will strive to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Red Army, defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and create new achievements for the people."

At the former residence of the great leader Chairman Mao—the Zao Garden, the poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen of the Zao Garden Production Brigade studied and discussed the communiqué carefully, time and time again. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!" echoed through the rainy night in Zao Garden. They enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and greatness, and strongly condemned the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scab Siao Chieh.

The old village head Yang Chengfu and the old Red Guard member Lei Zhifu, who lived in Zao Garden when Chairman Mao resided there, braved the rain and snow on the evening of November 3, carrying lanterns, climbing mountains and hills, visiting every household to report the joyous news of the publication of the communiqué to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The entire brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the communiqué and firmly supported the resolution unanimously passed by the plenary session to expel Siao Chieh from the Party forever, revoke all his Party and non-Party positions, and continue to investigate the crimes of Siao Chieh and his accomplices of betraying the Party and the nation. That night, they held a big struggle session at the place where the big villain Siao Chieh had lived, angrily denouncing his counter-revolutionary crimes. Old village head Yang Chengfu said, "The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the big villain Siao Chieh from the Party forever is truly a great relief! The wish of us poor and lower-middle peasants has finally been realized." Speaking with deep emotion, Yang Chengfu said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Every Communist Party member and revolutionary must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, always maintain the vigorous spirit of fighting against class enemies, follow Chairman Mao, and dedicate our lives to the revolution. Old Red Guard member and leader of the Zao Garden Production Brigade Lei Zhifu said, "Expelling the traitor, spy, and scab Siao Chieh from the Party forever is a great blessing for us poor and lower-middle peasants and the people of the whole nation. This is another great happiness that the great savior of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has brought to the people. We, the people of Yan'an nurtured by Chairman Mao, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. We will resolutely respond to the great call of the plenary session, continue to deeply carry out the great criticism, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will unswervingly follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path and turn the Zao Garden Production Brigade into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.
