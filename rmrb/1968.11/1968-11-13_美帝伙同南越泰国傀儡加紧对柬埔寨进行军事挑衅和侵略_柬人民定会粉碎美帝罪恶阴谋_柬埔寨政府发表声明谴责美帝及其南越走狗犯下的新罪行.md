The U.S. imperialists, in collusion with the South Vietnamese and Thai puppets, are intensifying military provocations and aggression against Cambodia. The Cambodian people will certainly smash the U.S. imperialists' evil plots. The Cambodian government has issued a statement condemning the new crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese lackeys.

	BEIJING, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued a statement on November 9, strongly condemning the new barbaric acts of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese lackeys on November 6 against the Cambodian people.

	On November 6, three helicopters of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese lackeys invaded the airspace of Cambodia's Takeo Province, savagely attacking a Cambodian village with rockets and machine guns, injuring 21 Cambodian residents, one of whom died from severe injuries. On the same day, 10 helicopters of the United States and its South Vietnamese lackeys invaded the airspace of Cambodia's Kampong Cham Province, chasing and attacking a milk truck on the road with rockets. Two Cambodian passengers on the truck were killed, and three others were seriously injured. In one day, U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese lackeys twice blatantly violated Cambodian airspace, killing and injuring 26 Cambodian residents. This is another extremely barbaric act of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese lackeys against the Cambodian people, and another piece of ironclad evidence of U.S. imperialism's persistent aggression policy against Cambodia.

	In its relentless expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with its South Vietnamese and Thai puppets, has been continuously conducting armed provocations and aggression against Cambodia. Their aircraft and warships frequently violate Cambodian airspace and territorial waters, killing Cambodian residents; their troops frequently shell and strafe Cambodian territory and villages, and even openly invade Cambodian territory, wantonly killing and kidnapping residents, committing heinous crimes. According to statistics from relevant Cambodian authorities, in the first half of this year alone, U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese and Thai lackeys conducted more than 100 acts of aggression against Cambodia from the air, sea, and land. Since the second half of this year, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have intensified such acts of aggression. On June 29, aircraft of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese lackeys invaded the airspace of Cambodia's Kampong Speu Province for strafing, killing and injuring 18 Cambodian residents. On July 17, U.S. imperialism openly dispatched landing craft to invade Cambodian territorial waters. From July 1 to 19, aircraft of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys invaded Cambodia 32 times, and so on.

	The acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have seriously violated Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, threatened Cambodia's security, and caused the Cambodian people to suffer heavy losses in life and property. U.S. imperialism hypocritically claims to "maintain Cambodia's peace and neutrality," but in reality, it is intensifying its acts of aggression against Cambodia. These facts once again powerfully demonstrate that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Cambodian people, the people of Indochina, and the people of the world. The Royal Government of Cambodia and its people have given due retribution to the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The U.S. landing craft that invaded Cambodian territorial waters on July 17 was immediately captured by the Cambodian Navy. On September 16, the Thai puppet troops were repulsed when they attacked Cambodian positions, with four killed and five wounded.

	The Cambodian people's struggle to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity has won the praise and support of the Chinese people, the people of Indochina, and the peace-loving people of the world. The intensified military provocations and aggression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Cambodia will only backfire. The heroic Cambodian people will certainly smash all the plots of aggression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and achieve even greater victories.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian News Agency reported on November 2 that the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted two notes of protest to the Thai puppet regime on October 31.

	The report said that one note strongly protested the multiple armed invasions by Thai troops into Cambodian territory in Odor Meanchey Province and Battambang Province on September 23, 28, and October 3 and 16. These invasions injured two Cambodian residents. The other note strongly protested the three instances in October where armed Thai fishing boats violated Cambodian territorial waters in Koh Kong Province. Among them, four armed fishing boats were seized by Cambodian patrol boats.

　　美帝伙同南越泰国傀儡加紧对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅和侵略
　　柬人民定会粉碎美帝罪恶阴谋
　　柬埔寨政府发表声明谴责美帝及其南越走狗犯下的新罪行
    新华社金边十二日电  本社记者报道，柬埔寨王国政府十一月九日发表一项声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其南越走狗十一月六日对柬埔寨人民犯下的新的野蛮侵略罪行。
    十一月六日，美帝国主义及其南越走狗的三架直升飞机侵入柬埔寨柴桢省领空，野蛮地用火箭袭击和用机枪扫射柬埔寨村庄，打伤柬埔寨居民二十一人，其中一人已因伤重死亡。同一天，美国及其南越走狗的十架直升飞机，还侵入柬埔寨桔井省上空，在公路上追击并用火箭袭击一辆载运乳品的卡车，车上两名柬埔寨乘客被打死，其他三人受重伤。在一天内，美帝国主义及其南越走狗两次明目张胆地侵犯柬埔寨领空，打死打伤柬埔寨居民二十六人，这是美帝国主义及其南越走狗对柬埔寨人民犯下的又一次极其野蛮的侵略罪行，这是美帝国主义对柬埔寨坚持其侵略政策的又一铁证。
    美帝国主义在不断扩大侵略越南的战争中，伙同它的南越和泰国傀儡，不断对柬埔寨进行武装挑衅和侵略。它们的飞机、军舰经常不断地侵犯柬埔寨领空和领水，杀害柬埔寨居民；它们的军队经常炮轰和扫射柬埔寨领土和村庄，甚至公然侵入柬埔寨境内，肆无忌惮地杀害和绑架居民，犯下了累累罪行。据柬埔寨有关方面统计，仅在今年上半年，美帝国主义及其南越和泰国走狗就从空中、海上和地面对柬埔寨进行了一百多次侵略。今年下半年以来，美帝国主义及其走狗更加紧了这种侵略活动。六月二十九日，美帝国主义及其南越走狗的飞机侵入柬埔寨波萝勉省上空进行扫射，打死打伤柬埔寨居民十八人。七月十七日，美帝国主义公然派遣登陆艇侵入柬埔寨领水。从七月一日到十九日，美帝国主义及其走狗的飞机对柬埔寨的入侵达三十二次之多，等等。
    美帝国主义及其走狗的这些侵略行动，严重地破坏了柬埔寨的主权和领土完整，威胁着柬埔寨的安全，使柬埔寨人民在生命和财产上蒙受了重大损失。美帝国主义口头上虚伪地声称什么“维护柬埔寨的和平与中立”，而实际上却加紧对柬埔寨的侵略行动。这些事实又一次有力地说明，美帝国主义是柬埔寨人民、印度支那人民和全世界人民共同的最凶恶的敌人。柬埔寨王国政府和人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的野蛮侵略，给予了应有的回击。今年七月十七日入侵柬埔寨领水的美国登陆艇，当场被柬埔寨海军俘获。九月十六日，泰国傀儡军队袭击柬埔寨阵地时，遭到柬埔寨方面的反击，被打死四人，打伤五人。
    柬埔寨人民为保卫主权和领土完整而进行的斗争，得到了中国人民、印度支那人民和全世界爱好和平人民的赞扬和支持。美帝国主义及其走狗加紧对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅和侵略，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。英勇的柬埔寨人民一定会粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的各种侵略阴谋，取得更大的胜利。
    据新华社金边电　据柬埔寨新闻社二日报道，柬埔寨外交部十月三十一日向泰国傀儡集团提交两份抗议照会。
    报道说，一份照会强烈抗议泰国军队在九月二十三日、二十八日和十月三日、十六日对奥多棉藏省和马德望省的柬埔寨领土的多次武装侵略。这些侵略使两个柬埔寨居民受伤。另一份照会强烈抗议武装的泰国渔船十月份三次侵犯戈公省的柬埔寨领海。其中有四艘武装渔船已被柬埔寨巡逻艇扣押。
