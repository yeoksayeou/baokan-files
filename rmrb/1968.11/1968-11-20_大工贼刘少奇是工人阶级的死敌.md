Under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee made the historic decision to expel the traitor, spy, and worker traitor Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and to revoke all his Party and state positions. This is a stern judgment of history, a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

For decades, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi has pretended to be a "labor leader," deceiving and swindling everywhere, committing countless evil deeds. He betrayed the leadership of the working class, advocating the "theory of class cooperation" and the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," castrating the revolutionary soul of the labor movement, and using economism to corrupt and disintegrate the ranks of the working class. At critical moments of the revolution, he ruthlessly suppressed the labor movement, attempting to abolish the proletarian revolution and overthrow the proletarian dictatorship. The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi is the sworn enemy of the working class. He is of the same ilk as the old and new worker traitors Bernstein, Kautsky, Khrushchev, Thorez, and Togliatti in the world.

Betraying the Leadership of the Working Class

The question of state power is the fundamental question of the revolution. The revolution relies on which class and is led by which class, determining the path to take and the type of state to establish. On this fundamental question, there has always been a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution." The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is the most resolute and thorough in revolution. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class has a high level of class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. They love Chairman Mao the most, are the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and are the most resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed."

The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi has always opposed relying on the working class, denied the leading role of the working class, and betrayed the leadership of the working class. In the early stages of the democratic revolution, he put forward the "theory of the immaturity of the working class," slandering workers as having "no public morality," being "guild-like" and "hooligan-like," and claiming that such an "immature proletariat" could not seize power. This is even more extreme than the right-opportunist Chen Duxiu's claim that the working class is "immature" in both "quantity" and "quality"! On the one hand, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi does not take the working class seriously at all, and on the other hand, he praises the bourgeoisie in every way, attempting to hand over the leadership of the proletariat, including military power, political power, and the leadership of mass movements, to the bourgeoisie, implementing the most thorough class capitulationism. Liu Shaoqi praised the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek as a "leader," describing the Kuomintang, which represents the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, as a "banner," and shouting that the Chinese revolution should be carried out "under this banner." He beautified the yellow unions of the Kuomintang, shouting that the yellow unions should become the "leading organs of mass movements." This is utterly absurd! Revolutionary practice has proven that since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its great leader Chairman Mao, has emerged as an independent political force on the historical stage, shouldering the responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution, fighting bravely and sacrificing themselves, and winning great victories in the people's revolution. The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi's slander of the working class, beautification and praise of the bourgeoisie, and betrayal of the leadership of the working class are all aimed at making the revolutionary labor movement a subordinate of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, maintaining the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

On the eve of national liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee that after the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide, the fundamental contradiction within the country is "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao sharply criticized the right-opportunist theory of relying on the bourgeoisie, emphasizing that "we must rely wholeheartedly on the working class." However, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi immediately put forward the "theory of the unreliability of the working class." He slandered the working class as a "broken chair," saying that "a chair is originally reliable, but if it has a defect, it becomes unreliable." But for the bourgeoisie, he praised them in every way. He repeatedly advocated that the Chinese bourgeoisie is still in its "youth," praising capitalists and reactionary "authorities" as understanding technology and having "management capabilities that surpass our Communist Party members," advocating handing over the leadership of factories and enterprises to capitalists and reactionary "authorities." He even knelt down before the capitalists, begging them to exploit workers, saying in a low voice, "Exploit a little, and I will have food to eat, and my wife and children will be able to live." This is utterly despicable! He relied on the bourgeoisie to develop capitalism and opposed socialism. He also openly opposed the working class leading the state power, inciting rightists to attack the Party, advocating the bourgeoisie's "bicameral system" and "open opposition," preparing public opinion for the bourgeoisie to take power. In the field of ideology and culture, he vigorously denied the leadership of the working class, stuffing traitors, spies, capitalist roaders, and reactionary academic "authorities" into important positions in these fields, attempting to make the fields of ideology and culture the frontline positions for restoring capitalism. In short, in the fields of economy, politics, and ideology, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi wanted to hand over the leadership to the bourgeoisie, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and make New China fall back into the dark abyss of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism.

"The working class must lead everything." The socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country must be carried out under the leadership of the working class. Denying the leading position of the working class is to oppose the proletarian dictatorship. In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese working class responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, taking the stage of political struggle in the superstructure, including various cultural fields, to achieve the proletarian dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in all fields of the superstructure. This is a great feat of the 1960s. The glorious achievements of the Chinese working class in various revolutionary periods eloquently prove that the working class must lead everything and can indeed lead everything, declaring the complete bankruptcy of the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi's so-called "theory of the immaturity of the working class" and "theory of the unreliability of the working class"!

Corrupting and Disintegrating the Ranks of the Working Class

All old and new worker traitors have used so-called "economic struggles" to oppose political struggles, using economism to oppose proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. For over forty years, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi has persistently pushed counter-revolutionary economism in the labor movement, corrupting and disintegrating the ranks of the workers, and betraying the fundamental interests of the working class.

In the period of the democratic revolution, this great traitor, in order to maintain the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, vigorously advocated that "the policy of the labor movement should be to engage in various economic struggles... The development of economic struggles is the development of the Chinese labor movement." He also said that "economic struggles can achieve victory, and the Chinese labor movement can take a smooth path." It is clear that the program he proposed for the labor movement is a counter-revolutionary economist program against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The "path" he wanted to open was completely opposite to Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the path of revisionism. His evil purpose of trying to put the labor movement on a "purely economic" track was to attempt to cancel the political struggle of the working class, oppose the labor movement to support the revolutionary war, and oppose the armed seizure of power.

Lenin once pointed out: "The loyal supporters of the bourgeoisie and the loyal supporters of the government serving the bourgeoisie have even tried more than once to organize purely economic unions to lure workers away from 'politics' and away from socialism." Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, is the loyal dog of the bourgeoisie that Lenin criticized. Whenever the revolutionary war developed victoriously and the political struggle of the working class flourished, this great traitor would jump out and shout loudly about "economic demands being the goal of the masses," that unions are "economic organizations," and that they should "faithfully fight for the economic demands of the masses" and not "fight for political tasks." These howls fully exposed his counter-revolutionary stance and the ugly face of a worker traitor. His advocated "economic struggles" were completely aimed at corrupting and disintegrating the working class, leading the labor movement astray.

To cover up the reactionary nature of his "economic struggles," Liu Shaoqi also shamelessly defended himself. He said that "economic struggles are also political struggles." His so-called "political struggles" were, in essence, begging for a few economic improvements and leftovers within the scope allowed by the Kuomintang's "Factory Law" and "Union Law." This would not touch a single hair of the Chiang family regime, would not change the status of the working class being ruled and enslaved, and would not solve any "economic problems."

After national liberation, this number one worker traitor still stubbornly pushed counter-revolutionary economism. He advocated that "production movements are labor movements" and promoted "fighting for the immediate living conditions of workers." Under the banner of "production and construction," he established "production unions" in large numbers, and under the banner of "caring for" the living conditions of workers, he established "welfare unions" in large numbers, promoting material incentives. It is clear that this set of goods is a rehash of his reactionary program of "the policy of the labor movement should be to engage in various economic struggles" in the new historical conditions, a betrayal of Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the proletarian dictatorship. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exists the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration." The most important task of the labor movement under the proletarian dictatorship is to firmly grasp class struggle, continuously consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, prevent capitalist restoration, and carry the socialist revolution to the end. Only in this way can we carry out socialist construction, support the world revolution, and prepare the conditions for the transition to communism. Abandoning the proletarian dictatorship and separating from the socialist revolution to develop production will never be able to establish a socialist economy and can only lead to capitalist restoration. The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi's frantic advocacy of "production movements are labor movements" aimed to eliminate class struggle, cancel the socialist revolution, cancel the proletarian dictatorship, and restore capitalism.

In socialist China under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the development of the national economy is not achieved through material incentives, but through proletarian politics as the commander, with the socialist revolution as the driving force, that is, "grasp revolution and promote production." The "fight for the immediate living conditions of workers" advocated by the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi, as well as the various bonus systems he implemented, are sugar-coated bullets aimed at the working class, aiming to corrupt and disintegrate the ranks of the working class and thus destroy the revolutionary labor movement. How poisonous his intentions are!

The counter-revolutionary economism that the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi has stubbornly pushed for over forty years is a thoroughgoing revisionist product. In the period of the democratic revolution, it was a tool serving the maintenance of reactionary rule; in the period of the socialist revolution, it was a tool for peaceful evolution and the restoration of capitalism.

Strangling and Suppressing the Revolutionary Labor Movement

The bourgeoisie has always used the two counter-revolutionary methods of economic bribery and military suppression to destroy the revolutionary labor movement and maintain their reactionary rule. The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi is a dog raised by the bourgeoisie. He not only used economism to corrupt and disintegrate the ranks of the working class but also, as early as the period of the democratic revolution, sold himself to imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and colluded with them to ruthlessly suppress the revolutionary labor movement, becoming a butcher with blood on both hands.

As early as 1921, Chairman Mao personally ignited the blazing revolutionary flames in Anyuan, and the miners' strike achieved brilliant victory. However, when the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi arrived in Anyuan, he signed an agreement with the capitalists ordering workers "not to disturb or threaten by gathering in crowds," and "not to go on strike at will," suppressing the revolutionary struggle of the workers and completely betraying the workers' most basic right to strike. He also personally went down the mine to "restore order" for the capitalists, personally punished workers who "did not follow the mine rules," and personally expelled workers who were considered "too radical." This great traitor thus openly helped the capitalists carry out a counterattack, seizing the victory fruits of the great strike from the hands of the workers.

During the first civil war when the Chinese working class bravely fought against the feudal warlords and imperialism, the working class in Guangdong, Hunan, Wuhan, and other places established workers' armed picket teams, "organized courts and prisons, inspected ships and trains," and "commanded local police," reclaiming foreign concessions and fiercely attacking the foundations of reactionary rule. All revolutionary people cheered for this, but the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi felt "no way out" and "wanted to die in despair." He followed the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, frantically cursing the labor movement as "excessive," the workers as "'leftist' and confused," and "unreasonable." In Wuhan, he was so frightened by the brave struggle of the workers' picket teams that he hurriedly, as the secretary of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, carried out "thought control" on the workers' picket teams, ordering workers "not to take action," fully revealing the opportunist face of this old traitor "rebelling on his knees." But when the Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a counter-revolutionary coup at a critical moment of the revolution, he became a traitor, providing "labor movement intelligence" to the Kuomintang reactionaries, plotting and strategizing, ordering the dissolution of the workers' picket teams, handing over thousands of guns, and even tying up the wooden sticks of the children's teams neatly and handing them over to the Kuomintang. He even shamelessly personally went to the Kuomintang Central Workers' Department to make a treacherous report titled "The Significance and Process of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Voluntarily Dissolving the Workers' Picket Teams." Half a month later, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a brutal massacre of the unarmed working class and revolutionary people. The great traitor and great spy Liu Shaoqi is truly a heinous criminal deserving of death!

After national liberation, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi used the Party and state power he usurped to frantically oppose the working class. He stood completely on the side of the bourgeoisie, running around for the capitalists, advocating that "capitalists should fight against workers." In factories and enterprises, he consistently opposed Chairman Mao's great teachings on carrying out mass movements, slandering mass movements as "rising in a frenzy," and suppressing mass movements in every way; he advocated "scientific management" and implemented "control, restriction, pressure, and punishment" on workers, promoting the establishment of capitalist discipline. Look, this great traitor who dreams of restoring capitalism hates the working class so much and uses such poisonous methods to deal with workers! Especially when the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution arrived, the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi sensed that his end was near and quickly put forward the bourgeois reactionary line of suppressing revolutionary masses, confusing right and wrong, implementing white terror, "surrounding and annihilating" the revolutionary faction, attempting to extinguish the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited by Chairman Mao, and fully revealing his butcher-like face.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeois dictatorship." The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi's crimes of suppressing the labor movement before and after liberation fully prove that he is the number one spy of the Chiang family regime within the working class, a loyal slave of the Kuomintang reactionaries!

Castrating the Revolutionary Soul of the Labor Movement

Lenin pointed out early on: "Without a revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." "Only revolutionary Marxism can become the banner of the workers' movement." In contemporary times, the only correct theory guiding the revolutionary labor movement is Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought reflects the fundamental interests and demands of the working class and the broad laboring people, is the guiding ideology for all the work of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole country, and is the soul of the revolutionary labor movement.

The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi has always fervently advocated "spontaneity." He shouted that the labor movement "must and mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses," repeatedly emphasizing that "the daily economic demands of workers should be used as the slogan to mobilize workers," and opposing "adding political slogans to the economic demands of the masses." The counter-revolutionary essence of these fallacies is to oppose the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought over the revolutionary labor movement, castrating the revolutionary soul of the labor movement.

The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices frantically opposed using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the labor movement, desperately destroying the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They slandered the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," "dogmatism," "utilitarianism," and "formalism," claiming that workers have low culture and cannot study, that production is busy and there is no time to study, using every means to obstruct the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. The great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi's destruction of the mass movement of workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was aimed at opposing the infusion of Mao Zedong Thought into the working class, aimed at infusing bourgeois ideology into the working class, and aimed at using the bourgeois worldview to guide the labor movement, attempting to lead the labor movement onto the path of opportunism.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is not spontaneously produced by the laboring people." "It is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, to change the spiritual face of the laboring people, and to turn spiritual strength into tremendous material strength." The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works advocated by Comrade Lin Biao is the fundamental way for the working class to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought. The fundamental task of the labor movement is to infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the working masses, to arm the workers' minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to build the workers' ranks into an industrial army that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship and the fundamental guarantee for our country to remain red for thousands of generations.

For decades, Liu Shaoqi has stood on the reactionary position of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, adapting to the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, betraying the fundamental interests of the working class, committing heinous crimes, and owing a blood debt. He is a loyal dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the enemy of the working class.

"Plum blossoms rejoice in the snow, freezing flies to death is nothing unusual." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has sentenced the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi to death politically, declaring the complete bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist labor line. We resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist labor line of the great worker traitor Liu Shaoqi, and let the great red flag of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high in the labor movement!

　　大工贼刘少奇是工人阶级的死敌
　　中华全国总工会　工向东
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲自主持下，具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十二中全会作出了把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的英明决定。这是历史的严峻的判决，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    几十年来，大工贼刘少奇冒充“工运领袖”，到处招摇撞骗，干尽了罪恶勾当。他出卖工人阶级领导权，鼓吹“阶级合作论”和“阶级斗争熄灭论”，阉割工人运动的革命灵魂，用经济主义腐蚀瓦解工人阶级队伍。在革命紧要关头，他残酷镇压工人运动，妄图取消无产阶级革命，颠覆无产阶级专政。大工贼刘少奇是工人阶级不共戴天的死敌。他同世界上的新老工贼伯恩斯坦、考茨基、赫鲁晓夫、多列士、陶里亚蒂之流，是一丘之貉。
　　出卖工人阶级领导权
    政权问题是革命的根本问题。革命依靠那个阶级、由那个阶级领导，决定着走什么道路和建立一个什么样的国家。在这个根本问题上，一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量”。工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的坚定性和彻底性。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，工人阶级具有高度的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们最热爱毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想，最坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线。“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”
    大工贼刘少奇一贯反对依靠工人阶级，否定工人阶级的领导作用，出卖工人阶级的领导权。在民主革命初期，他抛出了一个工人阶级“幼稚论”，诬蔑工人“素无公德”，有“行会性”、“流氓性”，胡说“这样幼稚的无产阶级”不能夺取政权。这和右倾机会主义分子陈独秀鼓吹的工人阶级在“数量上”和“质量上”都“很幼稚”的谬论比较起来，真是有过之而无不及！大工贼刘少奇一方面根本不把工人阶级放在眼里，另一方面却百般地颂扬资产阶级，妄图把无产阶级的领导权包括军权、政权和群众运动的领导权，一概让给资产阶级，实行最彻底的阶级投降主义。刘少奇大肆吹捧人民公敌蒋介石是“领袖”，把代表大地主大资产阶级利益的国民党说成是“旗帜”，叫嚷中国革命要在“这面旗帜下进行”。他美化国民党黄色工会，叫嚷使黄色工会成为“群众运动的领导机关”。真是荒谬透顶！革命的实践证明：从“五四”运动以后，中国工人阶级在中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛主席英明领导之下，作为独立的政治力量登上历史舞台，担负着领导中国革命的重任，前仆后继，英勇牺牲，赢得了人民革命的伟大胜利。大工贼刘少奇如此诬蔑工人阶级，美化颂扬资产阶级，出卖工人阶级的领导权，就是为了使革命工人运动变成大地主大资产阶级的附庸，维护帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治。
    在全国解放前夕，伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上英明地指出：中国革命在全国胜利以后，国内的基本矛盾，就是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。毛主席尖锐地批判了要依靠资产阶级的右倾机会主义谬论，强调指出：“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。可是，大工贼刘少奇却迫不及待地抛出了一个工人阶级“不可依靠论”。他诬蔑工人阶级是“破椅子”，胡说“椅子本来是可以依靠的，有了毛病，不可靠了”。但对于资产阶级，他却百般颂扬。他一再鼓吹中国资产阶级还处在“年青时代”，吹捧资本家和反动技术“权威”“懂得技术”，“管理能力超过我们的共产党员”，要把工厂企业的领导权交给资本家和反动技术“权威”。他甚至跪倒在资本家脚下，请求他们剥削工人，低声下气地说：“剥削一下，我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去”。这真是卑鄙无耻到了极点！他就是这样依靠资产阶级发展资本主义，反对社会主义。他还明目张胆地反对工人阶级领导国家政权，鼓动右派分子向党进攻，鼓吹什么资产阶级的“两院制”和“公开的反对派”，为资产阶级上台作舆论准备。在思想文化领域中，他更是竭力否定工人阶级的领导，把叛徒、特务、走资派和反动学术“权威”，塞到这些领域的重要岗位，妄图使思想、文化领域变成复辟资本主义的前沿阵地。总之，在经济、政治、思想各个领域中，大工贼刘少奇都要把领导权拱手送给资产阶级，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，使新中国重新坠入半封建、半殖民地的黑暗深渊。
    “工人阶级必须领导一切”。我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，都必须在工人阶级领导下进行。否定工人阶级的领导地位，就是反对无产阶级专政。在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性胜利的凯歌声中，中国工人阶级响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域对资产阶级的全面专政。这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大创举。中国工人阶级在各个革命时期所建立的不朽的功勋，雄辩地证明了工人阶级必须领导一切，而且也能够领导一切，宣告了大工贼刘少奇的所谓工人阶级“幼稚论”和“不可依靠论”的彻底破产！
　　腐蚀瓦解工人阶级队伍
    一切新老工贼没有一个不用所谓“经济斗争”反对政治斗争，用经济主义反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。大工贼刘少奇四十多年来一贯在工人运动中顽固推行反革命经济主义，腐蚀瓦解工人队伍，出卖工人阶级的根本利益。
    在民主革命时期，这个大工贼为了维护帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，竭力鼓吹“职工运动之方针，应做各种经济斗争，……经济斗争之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展。”还说什么“经济斗争能够得到胜利，中国职工运动即可取得一条顺利进行的道路。”很清楚，他为工人运动提出的这个纲领是一个反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命经济主义纲领。他所要开辟的“道路”，是同毛泽东思想完全相反的道路，也就是修正主义的道路。他竭力要把工人运动纳入“纯经济”轨道的罪恶目的，就是妄图取消工人阶级的政治斗争，反对工人运动配合革命战争，反对武装夺取政权。
    列宁曾经指出：“资产阶级的忠实拥护者和为资产阶级服务的政府的忠实拥护者，甚至不止一次地试图组织纯经济性的工会来引诱工人离开‘政治’，离开社会主义。”刘少奇这个大工贼就是列宁所痛斥的资产阶级忠实走狗。每当革命战争胜利发展，工人阶级的政治斗争蓬勃兴起的关键时刻，这个大工贼就跳出来大嚷大叫地鼓吹什么“经济要求，是群众的目的”，工会是“经济组织”，要“忠实为达到群众的经济要求而进行斗争”，不可“一味为政治任务而斗争”。这一阵阵嚎叫，把他的反革命立场、工贼的丑恶嘴脸暴露得一清二楚。他所鼓吹的“经济斗争”，完全是为了腐蚀瓦解工人阶级，将工人运动引入歧途。
    刘少奇这个大工贼为了掩盖他的“经济斗争”的反动本质，还无耻地进行狡辩。他胡说什么“经济斗争同时就是政治斗争”。他的所谓“政治斗争”，说穿了，就是在国民党反动派的“工厂法”、“工会法”所许可的范围内，乞求一点经济改良，讨一点残羹剩饭而已。这根本不会触动蒋家王朝的一根毫毛，根本不可能改变工人阶级被统治、被奴役的地位，也根本解决不了什么“经济问题”。
    在全国胜利以后，这个头号工贼仍然顽固地推行反革命经济主义。他鼓吹什么“生产运动就是工人运动”，宣扬什么“为工人切身生活而斗争”。他打着“生产建设”的幌子，大办“生产工会”，打着“关心”工人生活的幌子，大办“福利工会”，大搞物质刺激。很明显，他这一套货色就是他在民主革命时期鼓吹的那个“职工运动之方针，应做各种经济斗争”的反动纲领在新的历史条件下的翻版，是对毛主席无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论的背叛。
    伟大领袖毛主席英明指出：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”无产阶级专政条件下的工人运动的头等重要大事，就是牢牢抓住阶级斗争，不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底。只有这样，才能进行社会主义建设，支援世界革命，并为过渡到共产主义准备条件。放弃无产阶级专政，脱离社会主义革命来发展生产，绝不可能建立社会主义经济，只能导致资本主义复辟。大工贼刘少奇拚命鼓吹“生产运动就是工人运动”，其罪恶目的就是妄图抹杀阶级斗争，取消社会主义革命，取消无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下的社会主义中国，发展国民经济，绝不是靠物质刺激，而是以无产阶级政治为统帅，以社会主义革命为动力，即“抓革命，促生产”。大工贼刘少奇所提出的“为工人切身生活而斗争”，以及他所推行的名目繁多的奖金制度，都是射向工人阶级的糖衣炮弹，都是阴谋腐蚀瓦解工人阶级队伍，从而断送革命的工人运动。其用心何其毒也！
    大工贼刘少奇四十多年来顽固推行的反革命经济主义，是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。在民主革命时期，它是为维护反动统治服务的工具；在社会主义革命时期，它是和平演变，复辟资本主义的工具。
　　扼杀镇压工人革命运动
    资产阶级一贯采用经济收买和武力镇压的反革命两手，破坏工人革命运动，维护他们的反动统治。大工贼刘少奇是资产阶级豢养的走狗，他不仅用经济主义腐蚀瓦解工人阶级队伍，而且早在民主革命时期已卖身投靠了帝国主义、国民党反动派，并同他们串通一气，对工人革命运动进行残酷的镇压，是一个双手沾满了工人阶级鲜血的刽子手。
    早在一九二一年，毛主席在安源亲手点燃了熊熊革命烈火，路矿工人罢工取得辉煌胜利。可是，刘少奇这个大工贼一到安源，就和资本家签订了勒令工人
  “不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟”，“不能动辄罢工”的所谓
  “协议书”，镇压工人革命斗争，连工人阶级最起码的罢工权利也被他出卖得一干二净。他还亲自下井替资本家“整顿纪律”，亲自为资本家惩罚“不守矿规”的工人，亲自下毒手开除所谓“冒进”的工人领袖。这个大工贼就是这样公开地替资本家大搞反攻倒算，从工人手中夺走大罢工的胜利果实。
    在中国工人阶级向着封建军阀和帝国主义英勇斗争的第一次国内革命战争时期，广东、湖南、武汉等地的工人阶级，建立工人武装纠察队，“组织法庭监狱，检查轮船、火车”，“指挥当地警察”，收回外国租界，猛烈地冲击着反动统治的根基。广大革命人民对此无不拍手称快，而大工贼刘少奇竟然感到“无路可走”，
  “苦闷欲死”。他紧跟在大地主、大资产阶级屁股后面，气急败坏地大骂工人运动“过火”，工人“‘左’倾得糊涂”，“岂有此理”。在武汉，他被工人纠察队的英勇斗争吓得胆战心惊，慌忙以湖北省总工会秘书长的身份，对工人纠察队实行“思想控制”，限令工人“绝不能动手”，活现出这个老工贼“跪着造反”的机会主义嘴脸。而当国民党反动派实行反革命政变的革命危急关头，他竟充当内奸，向国民党反动派提供“工运情报”，出谋献策，下令解散工人纠察队，交出几千支枪，连童子团的木棍也捆得整整齐齐交给了国民党。他甚至还恬不知耻地亲自跑到国民党中央工人部，去做什么《湖北全省总工会自动解散工人纠察队之意义和经过》的叛卖报告。半个月后，国民党反动派便向手无寸铁的工人阶级和革命人民，发动了灭绝人性的大屠杀。大工贼、大内奸刘少奇真是十恶不赦，死有余辜！
    全国解放以后，大工贼刘少奇利用他所窃取的党政大权，疯狂反对工人阶级。他完全站在资产阶级立场上，为资本家奔走呼号，要“资本家向工人斗争”。他在工矿企业中，一贯反对毛主席关于大搞群众运动的伟大教导，诬蔑群众运动是什么“一哄而起”，百般扼杀群众运动；他打着所谓“科学管理”的招牌，对工人实行“管、卡、压、罚”，鼓吹建立资本主义的纪律。请看，这个一心梦想复辟资本主义的大工贼，对工人阶级是多么仇恨，对付工人的手段又是多么毒辣！特别是当无产阶级文化大革命的风暴来临时，大工贼刘少奇预感到他的末日已到，便急忙抛出镇压革命群众的资产阶级反动路线，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，实行白色恐怖，“围剿”革命派，妄图扑灭毛主席亲手燃起的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，彻底露出了他凶神恶煞般的刽子手面目。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”大工贼刘少奇解放前后镇压工人运动的累累罪行，充分说明了他是蒋家王朝派在工人阶级内部的头号奸细，是一个十足的国民党反动派的忠实奴才！
　　阉割工人运动的革命灵魂
    列宁早就指出：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”“只有革命马克思主义的理论，才能成为工人阶级运动的旗帜”。在当代，指导工人革命运动的唯一正确的理论就是毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想反映了工人阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益和要求，是我们全党全军全国一切工作的指导思想，是工人革命运动的灵魂。
    大工贼刘少奇一贯狂热地鼓吹“自发论”。他叫喊什么工人运动“必须而且主要是依靠群众的自发运动”，一再强调“以工人的日常经济要求作为动员工人的口号”，反对“在群众的经济要求上加上政治口号”。这些谬论的反革命实质，就是反对毛泽东思想对工人革命运动的领导，阉割工人运动的革命灵魂。
    大工贼刘少奇及其同伙疯狂反对用毛泽东思想指导工人运动，拚命破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们诬蔑活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动是“简单化”、“庸俗化”，是“教条主义”、“实用主义”、“形式主义”，胡说什么工人文化低学不懂，生产忙学不了，千方百计地阻挠毛泽东思想的广泛传播。大工贼刘少奇破坏工人活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，就是为了反对向工人阶级灌输毛泽东思想，就是为了向工人阶级灌输资产阶级思想，就是要用资产阶级世界观指导工人运动，妄图把工人运动引向机会主义的歧途。
    林彪同志指出：“毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的”，“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”林彪同志倡导的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是工人阶级学习、掌握毛泽东思想的根本途径。工人运动的根本任务，就是向工人群众灌输毛泽东思想，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装工人的头脑，把工人队伍建设成为永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的产业大军。这是巩固和加强无产阶级专政的根本保证，是我们国家千秋万代永不变色的根本保证。
    几十年来，刘少奇一直站在地主阶级、资产阶级的反动立场上，适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的需要，叛卖工人阶级的根本利益，犯下了滔天罪行，欠下了累累血债。他是帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，是工人阶级的死敌。
      “梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，从政治上宣判了大工贼刘少奇的死刑，宣告了反革命修正主义工运路线的彻底破产。我们坚决响应党的八届十二中全会的伟大号召，继续深入地展开革命大批判，彻底肃清大工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义工运路线的流毒，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗在工人运动阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
