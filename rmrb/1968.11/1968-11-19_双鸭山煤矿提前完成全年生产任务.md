The revolutionary workers of the Daqingshan Mining District in Heilongjiang Province, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have seen a surging wave of revolutionary criticism and denunciation throughout the mine, with frequent reports of production victories. The entire mine has completed its annual production task 48 days ahead of schedule.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Daqingshan Mining District has always regarded revolutionary criticism and denunciation as the driving force for all work. Recently, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, they have used Chairman Mao's latest directives as sharp weapons to launch a fierce criticism and denunciation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They have dragged the capitalist-roaders within the mine to the pithead and down into the pits, using a wealth of facts to denounce their master Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of the backwardness of the masses," "production first," "money as the commander," and "material incentives," and other revisionist black goods, causing a fundamental change throughout the mining district.

In the course of revolutionary criticism and denunciation, the revolutionary workers have smashed all unreasonable rules and regulations, greatly promoting the development of productive forces.

    双鸭山煤矿提前完成全年生产任务
    黑龙江省双鸭山矿区广大革命职工，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，全矿的革命大批判高潮一浪高过一浪，生产捷报频传，全矿提前四十八天胜利完成全年生产任务。
    双鸭山矿区革委会始终把革命大批判作为推动一切工作的动力。最近，他们在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为锐利武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义路线。他们把矿上的走资派揪到井口，带到井下，用大量事实狠批了他们的黑主子刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“群众落后论”、“生产第一”、“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，使整个矿区发生了翻天覆地变化。
    在革命大批判中，革命职工摧毁了一切不合理的规章制度，大大促进了生产力的发展。
