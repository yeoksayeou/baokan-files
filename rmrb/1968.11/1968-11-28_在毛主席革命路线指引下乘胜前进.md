	In Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we advance victoriously. Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Instructor of the Red Flag Militia Company of Hejiazhuang, Nian Jichong.

	"Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." Chairman Mao's extremely important directive points out to us an extremely important combat task. This is to seriously study the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, deeply understand Chairman Mao's theory on the continuation of the proletarian dictatorship's revolution, firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, consciously criticize the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly settle his accounts for betraying the Party and the country, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee is our guide for completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. It is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for preventing and opposing revisionism, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, building socialism, and opposing both "left" and right opportunism. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we must repeatedly and unremittingly explain Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the broad revolutionary masses, arming the revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's theories on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. This is the fundamental guarantee for preventing capitalist restoration, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, and building socialism. The 19-year struggle history of Hejiazhuang Brigade and the Red Flag Militia Company of Hejiazhuang in Cuicheng Commune of Lixian fully proves this. As early as the initial period of liberation, Hejiazhuang had a sharp struggle over the issue of power. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen organized peasant associations, wielding spears and long lances, launched a thunderous struggle against landlords and tyrants to reduce rent, destroying the foundation of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule; while Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Northwest and Gansu vigorously promoted "peaceful land reform," portraying Kuomintang's Central Bureau spies and tyrant landlords as "benevolent people" and "enlightened landlords," enabling them to escape the people's punishment. After the land reform, they conspired to organize counter-revolutionary rebellions and at the same time used sugar-coated bullets to corrupt cadres. The complex and sharp class struggle educated the poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen of Hejiazhuang. We reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably fight to the death with us, and we must not underestimate these enemies." Recognizing that the class enemies' outward appearance is benevolent while their hearts are full of malice, we resolutely launched a fierce attack on the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	In 1955, under Chairman Mao's great call, the tide of agricultural cooperation swept the country. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hejiazhuang had unprecedented socialist enthusiasm, leaping from mutual aid teams to high-level cooperatives. However, the great traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi, together with his agents in various regions, frantically sabotaged the cooperatives, claiming that cooperatives "walk in a line, work in a crowd," shouting "oppose rash advancement," and sharpening their knives to chop down the cooperatives. The landlords and rich peasants, seeing Liu Shaoqi as their black backer, were temporarily arrogant. Just as they were complacent, the great leader Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and his personally edited and annotated "Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside" were published, giving the poor and lower-middle peasants a compass and the militiamen a thousand-catty club. Chairman Mao taught: "The agricultural cooperation movement, from the very beginning, has been a serious struggle of ideas and politics. Every cooperative must go through such a struggle to be established." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places. Liu Shaoqi and his clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party failed in their conspiracy to oppose agricultural cooperation.

	From 1960 to 1962, when the national economy encountered temporary difficulties, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi came out again to undermine the socialist foundation and dismantle the socialist stage. They invented names and vigorously promoted "private plots," "reclaimed land," and "livestock to households" and other "three selfs and one contract" black goods, attempting to disintegrate the collective economy and restore capitalism. Just at this moment of dark clouds, the poor and lower-middle peasants who were loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line stood up and counterattacked the enemy. Old poor peasant Nian Tianran said: "I have suffered enough in the old society, individual farming is definitely not Chairman Mao's policy! Whoever advocates individual farming, I will go to Beijing with my cane to report to Chairman Mao." Just as the two lines were fiercely struggling in the countryside, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle." The poor and lower-middle peasants were full of vigor and fighting spirit, resolutely counterattacking all ghosts and snakes, thoroughly shattering Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' dream of restoring capitalism. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, after 19 years of class struggle, especially after the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have achieved decisive victories. However, we must remember Chairman Mao's warning in his report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must not think that the counter-revolutionary forces have submitted to us and have become revolutionaries, and that their counter-revolutionary thoughts and counter-revolutionary intentions no longer exist. It is not like this." The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin require us to clearly see that the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines will continue for a long time. We must fan the flames of the great revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, thoroughly settle their accounts for betraying the Party and the country, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, "continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant and impetuous," "continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," and together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, advance victoriously and forever advance under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    在毛主席革命路线指引下乘胜前进
    甘肃省革委会副主任、何家庄红旗民兵连指导员　年继荣
    “历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席这个极其重要的指示，给我们指出了一个十分重要的战斗任务。这就是认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，深刻理解毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，牢牢地掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自觉地批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，彻底清算其叛党叛国的滔天罪行，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席在七届二中全会的报告，是我们完成斗、批、改任务的指南，是防修反修，巩固无产阶级专政，建设社会主义，反对“左”右倾机会主义最强大、最锐利的思想武器。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经常地、反复地、坚持不懈地向广大革命群众讲解毛主席的革命路线，用毛主席关于阶级斗争、路线斗争的学说武装革命群众，这是防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，建设社会主义的根本保证。我们礼县崔城公社何家庄大队和何家庄红旗民兵连十九年的斗争历史充分证明了这一点。远在解放初期，何家庄就围绕着政权问题，展开了一场尖锐的斗争。广大贫下中农和民兵在毛主席革命路线的指引下，组织农会，手持梭标长矛，向地主恶霸展开轰轰烈烈的反霸减租斗争，摧毁了国民党反动派的统治基础；而刘少奇及其在西北、甘肃的代理人却极力推行“和平土改”，把国民党的中统特务、恶霸地主说成是什么“善人”、“开明地主”，使他们逃避了人民的惩罚。土改以后，他们阴谋组织反革命暴乱，同时用糖衣炮弹腐蚀干部。复杂尖锐的阶级斗争，教育了何家庄的贫下中农和民兵。我们重温毛主席的教导：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”认清了阶级敌人明里摆的是佛心，暗里揣的是刀子，于是，我们坚决地向地富反坏右分子发起了猛烈进攻，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    一九五五年，在毛主席的伟大号召下，农业合作化的高潮遍及全国。何家庄的贫下中农社会主义热情空前高涨，从互助组一跃办起了高级社。可是，刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼却伙同他在各地区的代理人疯狂破坏合作社，胡说什么合作社“走路一条龙，干活一窝蜂”，叫喊什么“反冒进”，磨刀霍霍要砍掉合作社。地富分子见有刘少奇这个黑后台为他们撑腰，猖狂一时。正在他们得意忘形的时候，伟大领袖毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》的报告和他老人家亲自选编并加了按语的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》发表了，贫下中农心里有了方向盘，民兵胸中有了千钧棒。毛主席教导说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。每一个合作社，不经过这样的一场斗争，就不能创立。”广大贫下中农用战无不胜的毛泽东思想同刘少奇及其在各地的代理人，进行了针锋相对的斗争。刘少奇同他的一伙党内走资派反对农业合作化的阴谋没有得逞。
    一九六○年到一九六二年，国民经济遇到暂时困难的时候，大叛徒刘少奇又出来大挖社会主义墙脚，大拆社会主义的台。他们巧立名目，大搞“自留地”“开荒地”“牲畜分到户”等“三自一包”的黑货，妄图瓦解集体经济，复辟资本主义。就在这乌云滚滚的时刻，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的贫下中农，挺身而出，反击敌人。老贫农年天随说：“旧社会的苦，我受够了，单干绝不是毛主席的政策！谁要提单干，我就拄着拐杖到北京去向毛主席他老人家告状。”正在农村两条路线激烈搏斗的时候，毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。贫下中农意气风发，斗志昂扬，坚决向一切牛鬼蛇神进行反攻，彻底打碎了刘少奇及其同伙复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。广大革命群众在毛主席革命路线的指引下，经过十九年的阶级斗争，特别是经过文化大革命的激烈的阶级大搏斗，我们已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是，我们要牢记毛主席在七届二中全会报告中告诫我们的：“决不可以认为反革命力量顺从我们了，他们就成了革命党了，他们的反革命思想和反革命企图就不存在了。决不是这样。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部要求我们清醒地看到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还将长期继续下去。我们必须把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，彻底批判刘少奇及其同伙的反革命修正主义思想，彻底清算他们的叛党叛国的滔天罪行，认真搞好斗、批、改。我们一定要学好用好毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的一系列最新指示，“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”，“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，同广大贫下中农和革命群众一道，在毛主席革命路线的光辉指引下，乘胜前进，永远前进！
