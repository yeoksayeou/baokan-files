Tianjin's working class, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, resolutely implements the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué. A new high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform has been swiftly launched, with each workshop and team as the battlefield. They are vigorously criticizing the heinous crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, and are doing a good job of streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office staff to the production front.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 7 - Tianjin's working class, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, is resolutely implementing the great tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party. A new high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform has been launched, determined to achieve even more brilliant results and welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Since the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenum was issued, Tianjin's factories and enterprises have held more than 13,000 classes to study and implement the communiqué. Workers in these classes use the method of "study, discuss, sing praises, and compare" to repeatedly study the plenum communiqué, review the two-year battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sing praises to Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, and summarize the struggle, criticism, and reform in their factories. Workers excitedly say: The more we study, the closer we feel to the great leader Chairman Mao, the deeper our feelings for Mao Zedong Thought, and the more we hate the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi.

Tianjin's working class, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, is fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, achieving remarkable results in struggle, criticism, and reform. Now, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenum, they are fully playing the leading role of the working class, pushing the struggle, criticism, and reform into a new high tide. Workers in various factories and enterprises are vigorously criticizing the traitorous crimes of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi. Workers in many factories, such as the Tianjin Hemp Textile Mill, also criticized Liu Shaoqi's infamous "Tianjin Speech" and his praise of the reactionary capitalist Song Qinyi, fully exposing his ugly face as a traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader. Workers excitedly say: The Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoke all his Party and non-Party positions. This is truly great, excellent! It greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. We support it a thousand times, ten thousand times!

While carrying out the revolutionary criticism, many factories organized worker investigation teams to enter the offices, working with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel to streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office staff to the production front, and help the factory revolutionary committees formulate revolutionary and production plans, highlighting proletarian politics and the leading role of the working class. Currently, 80% of the factories and enterprises in the city have drastically streamlined their organizations, transferring 70% of the office staff to the production front to participate in labor and receive re-education from the working class.

The revolutionary committees of various factories and enterprises in Tianjin are seriously implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on "expelling the old and taking in the new." Many factories have formulated plans for rectifying and building the Party, taking rectification and building the Party as the key point of struggle, criticism, and reform. On the day the communiqué was issued, the Party branch of the second team of Tianjin Automobile Factory Three was established and immediately held a Party branch meeting to study the communiqué. At the Party branch meeting, all Party members, using Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the Party as a weapon, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, further purging the poison of Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of joining the Party to become an official," and other six black theories. They formulated measures for the revolutionization of the Party branch and are determined to do a good job in rectifying and building the Party according to the requirements of the communiqué.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various fields of the superstructure have, in recent days, led the revolutionary masses to fully engage in the activities of studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenum, making the various units of the superstructure present a vibrant revolutionary scene. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Nankai University led the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students to set up more than 500 Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the communiqué. Revolutionary teachers and students, in various types of study and implementation classes of the communiqué they organized, enthusiastically sang praises to the brilliant leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Teachers and students also launched a revolutionary criticism, severely exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi.

Under the inspiration of the communiqué, Tianjin's working class has also achieved new results in production. The Tianjin Coal Mine Equipment Factory, Tianjin Hemp Textile Mill, and Tianjin Small Electric Motor Factory have all completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule and have now formulated new measures to make production even better. The workers in the rest of the factories and enterprises are deeply carrying out the activities of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other. They have expressed their determination to fight for more than 50 days to overfulfill this year's production plan and report good news to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    天津工人阶级以高昂的革命热情
    坚决落实公报提出的战斗任务
    迅速掀起了斗、批、改新高潮，各工厂企业以车间、班组为战场，狠批叛徒刘少奇的滔天罪行，做好精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等工作
    新华社天津七日电　天津市工人阶级以高昂的革命热情，坚决贯彻执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报提出的各项伟大任务，掀起了斗、批、改新高潮，决心创造出更加辉煌的成绩，迎接中国共产党第九次全国代表大会的召开。
    从党的八届十二中全会公报发表以来，天津市各工厂企业已经举办了一万三千多个以学习和贯彻执行公报为内容的毛泽东思想学习班。广大工人在学习班上，采用“一学二议三歌颂四对照”的方法，反复学习全会公报，回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，歌颂毛主席的英明领导，对照总结工厂里的斗、批、改。广大工人激动地说：越学，对伟大领袖毛主席越亲，对毛泽东思想的感情越深，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇越恨。
    天津市工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使斗、批、改取得了显著的成绩。现在，他们又在八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，推动斗、批、改进入一个新的高潮。各工厂企业的工人，纷纷以车间、班组为战场，人人口诛笔伐，狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇叛党、叛国的滔天罪行。天津麻纺织厂等许多工厂的工人，还批判了刘少奇的臭名昭著的“天津讲话”和他吹捧反动资本家宋棐卿的罪行，充分揭露了他的叛徒、内奸、工贼的丑恶嘴脸。工人们兴奋地说：党的八届扩大的十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，真是好得很，好极了！它大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    在开展革命大批判的同时，许多工厂组织工人调查组进驻科室，同革命干部、革命的技术人员一起，做好精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等项工作，帮助工厂革委会制定革命和生产规划，突出了无产阶级政治，突出了工人阶级的领导作用。目前，全市已有百分之八十的工厂企业大刀阔斧地精简了机构，下放了百分之七十的科室人员到生产第一线参加劳动，接受工人阶级的再教育。
    天津市各工厂企业的革委会认真落实伟大领袖毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的最新指示，有许多工厂制定了整党建党的规划，把整党建党作为斗、批、改的重点来抓。全会公报发表的当天，正在整党建党的天津人民汽车三厂二连成立了党支部，连夜召开党支部大会，学习全会公报。在党支部大会上，全体党员以毛主席的无产阶级建党路线为武器，狠批了刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线，进一步肃清刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”“入党做官论”等黑“六论”的流毒。他们订出了党支部革命化的措施，决心按照全会公报的要求搞好整党建党工作。
    进驻上层建筑各个领域的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，近几天领导革命群众，全力投入学习、宣传、落实八届十二中全会公报的活动，使上层建筑各单位出现了一片朝气蓬勃的革命景象。驻南开大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，领导革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生，办起了五百多个学习公报的毛泽东思想学习班。革命师生们在他们举办的各种类型的学习、落实全会公报的讲用会上，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，歌颂无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。师生们还展开了革命大批判，狠揭狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命罪行。
    在全会公报的鼓舞下，天津市工人阶级在生产上也取得了新的成就。天津煤矿设备厂、天津麻纺织厂、天津小型电机厂等工厂已经提前完成今年全年生产计划，现在又制订了新措施，决心把生产搞得好上加好。其余的工厂企业的工人正在深入开展比学赶帮活动，他们表示决心奋战五十多天，超额完成今年的生产计划，向伟大领袖毛主席报喜。
