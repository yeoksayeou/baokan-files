Friends from Tanzania, Mali, and Congo (Brazzaville) warmly celebrate the publication of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC.

The brilliant thought of Mao Zedong takes root in socialist China.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' plot to restore capitalism in China is thoroughly defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: Friends from Tanzania, Mali, and Congo (Brazzaville) warmly celebrate the publication of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Enlarged Central Committee of the CPC.

A Tanzanian youth told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "The plenary session, personally chaired by Chairman Mao, reviewed the two-year victorious course of the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world. China has become unprecedentedly strong in the cultural revolution. We African people are genuinely happy about the victory of the Chinese people."

He expressed support for the decision of the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, and emphasized, "This is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique."

The Tanzanian youth also read to the reporter this passage from the communiqué: "The plenary session believes, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, that the world revolution has entered a great new era. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of all countries in the world are developing vigorously." He said, "This analysis is a great encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of the world. The communiqué calls on all peoples oppressed by U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys to form a broad united front against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, which points out a path to victory for the revolutionary peoples of the world."

Another Tanzanian friend said, "Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the great proletarian cultural revolution in China has achieved great victories. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world."

He said, China has always adhered to the policy of proletarian internationalism. "China's aid has always been sincere and selfless. Liu Shaoqi has always opposed China's support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Expelling him from the party is a good thing for the world revolutionary struggle."

An African worker in Tanzania said, "Expelling Liu Shaoqi from the party is completely correct. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people will follow the socialist path. However, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices want to follow the capitalist path, pushing China back to a colonial state. When I think of the suffering we endured under colonial rule, I hate Liu Shaoqi even more."

A Malian worker said, the decision of the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, "is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, because Liu Shaoqi is an enemy hidden within the CPC, wearing the party's cloak but engaging in activities to sabotage the revolution. If he were to occupy the leadership position, he would cause the revolutionary ship to capsize."

He said, "The decision that intellectuals must undergo re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers is very correct. Intellectuals must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite with workers and peasants, and undergo re-education by workers and peasants."

A Malian friend said, expelling Liu Shaoqi from the party forever is a great victory for the Chinese people. This means that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can discover and defeat the hidden enemy Liu Shaoqi, who wears a revolutionary cloak. We are confident that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will continue to victoriously carry out the socialist revolution and eliminate the path of capitalist restoration.

Another Malian friend said, "Liu Shaoqi is a typical Khrushchev-like figure. Just as people say in Bambara, a rat bites a person's foot at night, and the person does not feel it immediately, but feels the pain the next day. Liu Shaoqi is a rat that sabotages the revolution. Therefore, I say, expelling Liu Shaoqi from the party is a great victory for the Chinese people."

A Congolese (Brazzaville) friend, Albert, said in his speech that the publication of the communiqué of the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC is a great encouragement to all revolutionary peoples in the world. We warmly celebrate the great achievements of the Chinese people in the cultural revolution under the wise leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao. We warmly hail the decision to expel Liu Shaoqi from the CPC forever.

Albert emphasized that the 12th Plenary Session shows that Chairman Mao's invincible great thought is an extremely powerful ideological weapon for us to oppose imperialists, colonialists, and reactionaries.

A Congolese (Brazzaville) friend named Gabriel Miyazis said, the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC is a historic session. It announces to the world the thorough defeat of the plot by Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices to restore capitalism in China.

He went on to say, the CPC and the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Another Congolese (Brazzaville) friend, Kongbo, said, Liu Shaoqi, who has been boasting for many years as an "old revolutionary," has been thrown into the garbage heap of history. This is a great victory for all revolutionaries in the world. The revolutionary peoples of the world warmly hail the decision of the 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC.

Kongbo finally said, the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought will forever take root in socialist China, and Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

　　坦桑尼亚、马里、刚果（布）朋友热烈欢呼中共八届十二中全会公报发表
　　光辉的毛泽东思想扎根于社会主义中国
　　叛徒刘少奇及其同伙企图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产
    新华社十日讯　坦桑尼亚、马里和刚果（布）朋友热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表。
    一位坦桑尼亚青年对新华社记者说：“由毛主席亲自主持的这次全会回顾了震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命两年来的胜利历程。中国在文化大革命中变得空前强大了。我们非洲人民对中国人民的胜利衷心地感到高兴。”
    他表示支持中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会把刘少奇永远开除出党的决议，并且强调指出：“这是对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的修正主义的一个沉重打击。”
    这位坦桑尼亚青年还向记者念了公报中的这段话：“全会认为，正如毛泽东同志所说，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。全世界各国人民的革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。”他说：“这个分析是对世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。公报号召一切被美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和他们的走狗所压迫的人民结成一个反对美帝和苏修的广泛的统一战线，这给世界革命人民指出了一条走向胜利的道路。”
    另一位坦桑尼亚朋友说：“由于毛主席的正确领导，中国的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利。这是对非洲、亚洲和世界其他地方的革命人民的巨大鼓舞。”
    他说：中国一贯奉行无产阶级国际主义的政策。“中国的援助始终是真诚的、无私的。刘少奇一贯反对中国支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争。把他开除出党，对世界革命斗争来说，是一件很好的事情。”
    一位在坦桑尼亚的非洲工人说：“把刘少奇清洗出党是完全正确的。在毛主席领导下的中国工人阶级和广大人民群众要走社会主义道路。但是，刘少奇及其同伙却要走资本主义道路，即把中国推回到殖民地状态。当我想起我们过去在殖民统治下所受的痛苦时，我就更加痛恨刘少奇。”
    一位马里工人说：中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会作出的关于把刘少奇永远开除出党的决议，“是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，因为刘少奇是一个埋藏在中国共产党内部的敌人，他披着党的外衣，却干着破坏革命的勾当。如果让他占据领导岗位，他就会使革命的航船覆没。”
    他说：“关于知识分子必须接受工农兵再教育的决定是非常正确的。”“知识分子必须遵循毛主席的教导，同工农打成一片，接受工农的再教育。”
    一位马里朋友说：把刘少奇永远开除出党，是中国人民的一个伟大胜利。这就是说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，能够发现和战胜披着革命外衣的工贼刘少奇这个十分隐蔽的敌人。我们深信，在毛主席英明领导下的中国人民，必将继续胜利地进行社会主义革命和杜绝资本主义复辟的道路。
    另一位马里朋友说：“刘少奇是一个地地道道的赫鲁晓夫式的人物。真象人们用邦巴拉语所说的那样，老鼠在夜里咬人的脚，人是不会马上感觉到的，但到了第二天才感到很疼痛。刘少奇是破坏革命的老鼠。因此我说，把刘少奇清除出党是中国人民的一个伟大胜利。”
    刚果（布）朋友阿尔培尔发表谈话说，中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，对全世界的一切革命人民是一个极大的鼓舞。我们热烈庆贺中国人民在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的英明领导下，在文化大革命中取得的伟大成就。我们热烈欢呼把刘少奇永远开除出中国共产党。
    阿尔培尔强调说，十二中全会表明，毛主席的战无不胜的伟大思想，是我们用以反对帝国主义者、殖民主义者和反动派的极其强大的思想武器。
    一位名叫加布里尔·米亚齐斯的刚果（布）朋友说，中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会是一次具有历史意义的会议。它向全世界宣告了刘少奇及其同伙企图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋的彻底破产。
    他接着说，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党和中国人民，摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    另一位刚果（布）朋友孔博说，多年来自吹是“老革命”的刘少奇，已经被扔进了历史的垃圾堆。这是全世界一切革命者的伟大胜利。世界革命人民最热烈地欢呼中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的决议。
    孔博最后说，光辉的毛泽东思想将永远扎根于社会主义的中国，毛泽东思想永远照亮着世界革命人民的心。
