We have studied Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and reviewed the journey we have taken on the socialist path over the past nineteen years. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, feel particularly close to it and are even more determined to walk the socialist path.

Before liberation, Tianhua was a notorious poor mountain village. The officials extorted money, the landlords oppressed the people, and disasters were frequent. After liberation, we resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize together" and were among the first to establish a mutual aid team consisting of nine poor and lower-middle peasant households. At that time, landlords and rich peasants sneered, "Let's see what these nine poor devils can do." Counter-revolutionaries also said behind our backs, "Just wait and see! They won't last a year." We gave these bastards a fierce rebuttal. We said, "The socialist path guided by Chairman Mao, we have decided to walk. Anyone who dares to oppose us, we will fight to the end." At that time, our mutual aid team had only one small cow and two broken water wheels. We firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of self-reliance and hard struggle. When there were not enough oxen, we used people to pull the plows; when the tools were broken, we repaired them ourselves, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient oxen and tools. That year, there was a severe drought, and for over forty days, not a drop of rain fell. The crops of individual farmers mostly withered, but our mutual aid team, because of the many people, had insufficient water wheels, so we mobilized the team members to carry water to irrigate the fields, fighting against the drought day and night. As a result, our yield per mu was seventy percent higher than that of individual farmers, achieving a good harvest in the first year after the establishment of the mutual aid team, fully demonstrating the superiority of collectivization. From then on, our mutual aid team continued to expand, quickly growing from nine households to forty-five households, establishing a primary cooperative, then upgrading to a higher-level cooperative, and establishing a people's commune. We have always been at the forefront. We have made great strides on the socialist path, completely changing the backward face of Tianhua.

However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great swindler Liu Shaoqi never forgot about capitalism and opposed our walking the socialist path, doing everything he could to lead us down the capitalist road to death. In April 1961, he came to our Tianhua Brigade for his so-called "field visit," which was a rehearsal for his restoration of capitalism. To peddle his black goods of restoring capitalism, he also sent a work team to our production brigade for a trial point.

As soon as the work team entered our production brigade, they, following Liu Shaoqi's instructions, loudly praised the "three autonomies and one contract" as having "endless benefits," being able to "mobilize the enthusiasm of the members," making everyone have "oil" and "prospects." We were so angry that we almost burst. We sat silently at their member meeting. As soon as they left, we held another meeting. The members said, "This time, what they are doing is exactly the opposite of Chairman Mao's call. Chairman Mao calls on us to organize together and walk the socialist path, but they want to undermine the foundation of socialism. Chairman Mao said, 'Only socialism can save China,' but they say individual farming has 'enthusiasm,' 'oil,' and 'prospects.' The more we talked, the angrier we became, and we decided to fight them head-on.

At the subsequent meetings held by the work team, we angrily questioned them: After liberation, we followed Chairman Mao to walk the socialist path, turning a poor mountain village into a granary. Why don't you let us walk the socialist path? As for mobilizing enthusiasm, we first ask what kind of enthusiasm to mobilize? We have no capitalist enthusiasm, no matter how you mobilize it, it's in vain. We have socialist enthusiasm throughout our bodies. This is how we have walked for over a decade. As for saying that individual farming has "endless benefits" and "prospects," our ancestors in the old society were all individual farmers. For how many years have we struggled? In the end, what we struggled for was still the bitter life of "fleeing and begging for food in other places"! We have had enough of the bitterness of individual farming. After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the poor have stood up, and we have taken the road of collectivization, and we will never be poor again. Whoever opposes us walking the socialist path, we will not agree a thousand times. The poor and lower-middle peasants of our production brigade united as one, with indignation in our hearts, and drove away the work team sent by Liu Shaoqi.

We deeply understand that the socialist path guided by Chairman Mao is the only bright, liberating, and happy path. This path we have decided to walk. We must carry out the struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside to the end and forever follow the socialist path pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao.

    社会主义道路我们走定了
    天华大队贫农社员  常义全
    学习毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，看看十九年来在社会主义道路上走过的历程，我们贫下中农感到格外亲切，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    解放前的天华，是一个有名的穷山窝，官府勒索、地主压迫，灾难重重。解放后，我们坚决响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，最早办起了由九户贫下中农组成的互助组。当时，地主、富农在一旁讽刺说：“看这九个穷鬼能搞出什么屁名堂。”反革命分子也在背后说：“等着看热闹吧！不到一年，他们就要垮了。”我们对这些家伙的恶言冷语给了狠狠的回击。我们说：“毛主席指引的社会主义大道，我们走定了，谁敢反对，我们就和他拚到底。”当时，我们互助组只有一头小牛、两架破水车，我们牢记毛主席自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导，牛不够，我们就用人拉犁；农具坏了，我们就动手修好，克服了耕牛、农具不足的困难。这年天大旱，四十多天没有下一滴雨，单干户的禾苗大多都干死了，而我们互助组由于人多，水车不够用，就发动组员挑水灌田，日夜抗旱，结果亩产比单干户高百分之七十，获得了成立互助组后第一年的好收成，充分显示了集体化的优越性。从此，我们互助组不断扩大，很快由九户发展到四十五户，成立了初级合作社，以后升高级社，办人民公社，我们始终跑在最前面。我们在社会主义道路上阔步前进，彻底改变了天华的落后面貌。
    可是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇却念念不忘资本主义，反对我们走社会主义道路，千方百计把我们往资本主义死路上引。一九六一年四月，他到我们天华大队的所谓“蹲点”，就是他复辟资本主义的一次演习。为了推销他那一套复辟资本主义的黑货，他还派工作队到我们生产队试点。
    工作队一进我们生产队，就秉承刘少奇的旨意，大肆吹嘘“三自一包”“好处无穷”，可以“调动社员的积极性”，使大家“有油水”、“有奔头”。我们一听，肺都要气炸了。我们按着一肚子火，在他们主持的社员会上一言不发。等他们一走，我们又开起会来。社员们说：这次他们来搞的名堂，怎么尽是和毛主席的号召相反的。毛主席号召我们组织起来，走社会主义道路，可他们却要挖社会主义墙脚。毛主席说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。而他们却说单干“有积极性”、“有油水”、“有奔头”。大家越说越气愤，决心和他们展开针锋相对的斗争。
    在以后工作队召开的会上，我们气愤地质问他们：解放后，我们跟毛主席走社会主义道路，使穷山窝变成了米粮仓，你们为什么不让我们走社会主义道路？要说调动积极性，我们首先要问是调动什么积极性？资本主义积极性，我们一点没有，随你们怎么调动也是白费劲。社会主义积极性，我们浑身都是。十多年来，我们就是这样走过来的。要说单干“好处无穷”、“有奔头”，我们祖祖辈辈在旧社会都是单干的，奔了多少年，到头奔来的还不是“逃荒讨米走他乡”的苦难生活！单干的苦头我们尝够了。解放后，在毛主席领导下，穷人翻了身，走上了集体化的道路，才永远不受穷了。谁要反对我们走社会主义道路，我们一千个不答应。我们生产队的贫下中农团结一致，怀着满腔怒火，硬是把刘少奇派来的工作组给轰走了。
    我们深深懂得：毛主席指引的社会主义道路，是一条唯一的光明的路，解放的路，翻身的路，幸福的路。这条路我们走定了。我们一定要把农村两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，永远沿着伟大领袖毛主席指出的社会主义道路前进。
