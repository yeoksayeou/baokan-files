	Establishing a Revolutionary Teacher Corps
	By transferring public primary schools to the management of production brigades, the greatest benefit is that the poor and lower-middle peasants gain the power to manage the schools, allowing teachers to truly educate students according to the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This also promotes the ideological revolutionization of the teachers themselves.

	In the past, although public primary schools were located in rural areas, who the teachers were and what ideology they used to educate students, not only did the poor and lower-middle peasant masses not have a say, but even the brigade party branches and cadres had no control. For example, previously, there was a rich peasant element who had infiltrated the teaching corps in our area. He repeatedly harmed students, and the masses drove him out of one school, only for the capitalist roaders to place him in another. That school drove him out, and he was placed in yet another school. In the end, he remained a teacher in a public school, and no one could do anything about it. Because of this, although public primary schools were in the villages, the poor and lower-middle peasants had no way to manage them.

	Since our great leader Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive on the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhangling Commune immediately took control of rural education. They took over the original twelve public primary schools and eight private primary schools and also established thirty-eight new primary schools. Now there are a total of fifty-eight schools, with students increasing by more than sixty percent compared to the past, and the entire commune has basically achieved universal primary education.

	After the schools were managed by the production brigades' poor and lower-middle peasants, each brigade first cleaned up the teaching corps, supervising landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had infiltrated the teaching corps to engage in labor. From among the activists who study Chairman Mao's works, excellent work-point recorders, storemen, pump operators, and returned educated youth who had undergone a relatively long period of labor training, a batch of new teachers were selected. Additionally, eighty-two old poor peasants, brigade cadres, and demobilized soldiers were hired as part-time teachers. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants generally feel, "This is truly our own revolutionary teaching corps."

	This revolutionary teaching corps is dedicated to educating the poor and lower-middle peasants. Those poor and lower-middle peasant children who had to herd cattle, cut pig fodder, or take care of younger siblings, and were previously excluded from school, now have teachers who have set up morning, evening, half-day, rain-day, and flexible classes for them, allowing them all to attend school. In Fenghuang Brigade's Fourth Production Team, there are four children of poor peasants who had always wanted to study but had to stay home to take care of younger siblings and could not attend school. After the poor peasant's daughter Wang Chuanxiang became a teacher, she, with deep class feelings, organized a few elderly women to help take care of the younger siblings for half a day each day. These four children of poor peasants happily attended the half-day classes. Wang Run'e's family of eight has a heavy burden, and the brigade arranged for her to herd cattle. Wang Chuanxiang specially opened a flexible class for her, and this twelve-year-old poor peasant girl was able to study.

	These schools are managed by the brigades, and the brigade cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants manage them very seriously. They strictly demand political standards from the teachers, firmly support them in their work, and warmly care for them in their lives. Over the past few months, the entire commune, with brigades as the unit, has organized teachers to spend half a day each week studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and exchanging new teaching experiences. The brigade poor peasant association chairmen and the leaders of the educational revolution leadership groups personally conduct class education and ideological work for the teachers in their own brigades. In a recent period, a handful of class enemies maliciously attacked, saying, "Now the teachers are not up to standard, they have lost all tradition," "Barefoot into the classroom, fame rings out, but they can't teach well, blind people come out of the classroom." The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support their own teachers and immediately counterattacked the class enemies. They said, "The class enemies oppose our teachers, which is opposing the poor and lower-middle peasants taking control of cultural power." They exposed the class enemies, thoroughly criticized and condemned them, completely smashed the class enemies' attacks, and rapidly grew the revolutionary teaching corps amidst the waves of class struggle.

　　建立一支革命化的教师队伍
    把公办小学下放到大队来办，最大的好处是使贫下中农有了管理学校的实权，可以使学校教师真正按照贫下中农的要求办学，同时又可以促进教师本身的思想革命化。
    过去公办小学虽然办在农村，可是教师是些什么人，他们用什么思想去教育学生，莫说贫下中农群众，就是大队党支部和队干部也管不着。如以前我们这里有个混进教师队伍的富农分子，屡屡残害学生，群众把他从这个学校赶出去，走资派又把他安插在那个学校；那个学校把他赶出去，又把他安插在另外一个学校，到头来还是一个公办学校的教师，谁也奈何不得他。正因为是这样，所以公办小学虽说是在村里，可是村上的贫下中农对它没办法管理。
    自从我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了关于贫下中农管理学校的英明指示，我们张岭公社的贫下中农立即掌握了农村教育大权，把原有十二所公办小学和八所民办小学统统管了起来，同时又新办了三十八所小学。现在共有学校五十八所，学生比过去增加了百分之六十以上，全社基本上普及了小学教育。
    学校归生产大队贫下中农来办以后，各队首先清理了教师队伍，对混到教师队伍里来的地、富、反、坏、右分子监督劳动。从学习毛主席著作积极分子、优秀的记工员、保管员、抽水机手和经过较长时期劳动锻炼的回乡知识青年中选拔了一批新教师。还聘请了八十二名老贫农、队干部、复员军人担任兼职教师。现在贫下中农普遍反映：“这才是我们自己的革命教师队伍。”
    这支革命的教师队伍，一心一意为贫下中农办学。那些要放牛、打猪草、带弟妹的贫下中农子女，过去一直被排斥在学校门外，现在教师为他们开办了早班、晚班、半日班、雨天班、随到随教的机动班，使他们都进了学校。凤凰大队四生产队有四个贫农的孩子，过去很想读书，可是要在家里带弟弟妹妹，上不了学。贫农的女儿王川香当上教师后，怀着深厚的阶级感情，组织几个老婆婆每天帮他们带半天弟妹，这四个贫农的子女就高高兴兴地进了半日班学习。王润娥一家八口，负担比较重，队里照顾她放牛，王川香就专门给她开了个随到随教班，这个十二岁的贫农女孩子也能念书了。
    这些学校由大队来办，队干部和广大贫下中农管得可认真了。对教师在政治上严格要求，工作上坚决支持，生活上热情关怀。几个月来，全社以大队为单位，每周都组织教师用半天时间学习毛主席的最新指示，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，交流新的教学经验。大队贫协主任、教育革命领导小组负责人还亲自对本队小学教师进行阶级教育，做思想政治工作。前个时期，一小撮阶级敌人恶毒攻击说：“现在教师不象样，把传统丢光了”，“赤脚板进学堂，名声响当当，书又教不好，瞎子出学堂。”贫下中农坚决支持自己的教师，立即向阶级敌人进行反击。他们说：“阶级敌人反对我们的教师，就是反对贫下中农掌握文权。”他们把阶级敌人揪出来，批倒批臭，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的进攻，使革命教师队伍迎着阶级斗争的风浪迅速成长起来。
