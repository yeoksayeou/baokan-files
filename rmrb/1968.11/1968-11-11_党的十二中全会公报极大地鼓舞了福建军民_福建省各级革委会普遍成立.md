The public report of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee greatly inspires the military and civilians of Fujian. Revolutionary committees have been established at all levels in Fujian Province.

Except for Jinmen County, all special districts, cities, and counties in the province, as well as the vast majority of industrial enterprises and rural people's communes, have established revolutionary committees. Twenty thousand military personnel and civilians gathered in Fuzhou to celebrate, determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao and advance bravely to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 10th: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and inspired by the public report of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, revolutionary committees have been established in all nine special districts, cities, and sixty-six counties in Fujian Province, except for Jinmen County. Revolutionary committees have also been established in the vast majority of industrial enterprises and rural people's communes in the province.

On November 9th, in the heroic city of Fuzhou on the coastal defense line, twenty thousand military personnel and civilians from Fujian Province and Fuzhou City held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of revolutionary committees in the entire province, except for Jinmen County. This meeting was a celebration of victory and also a mobilization meeting to further implement the battle tasks proposed by the plenum and to launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the province. The revolutionary masses carried giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, held copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted slogans such as "Firmly implement the great battle call of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee!" "Overthrow the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" "We are ready at any time to liberate Jinmen and Mazu! Ready at any time to liberate Taiwan!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They surged into the venue in an endless stream. Leaders from the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Fuzhou City Revolutionary Committee, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou attended the meeting and delivered speeches. The leader of the provincial revolutionary committee read the "Decision of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee on Deeply Propagating and Firmly Implementing the Public Report of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee," calling on the military and civilians throughout the province to further fully implement the various battle tasks proposed by the plenum.

After the public report of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was published, a magnificent wave of learning, propagating, and implementing the plenum report swept across the province. The revolutionary masses in Qingliu, Ninghua, Gutian, Datian, Huian, Minqing, and Jianyang counties, who were in the process of establishing revolutionary committees, quickly set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes focusing on studying the plenum report after its publication. They held continuous revolutionary criticism meetings to denounce the heinous crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, and strongly promote the early realization of the three-in-one combination. Through learning and criticism, the revolutionary masses greatly enhanced their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, unanimously recognizing that the prolonged "internal war" between the two factions was caused by the cunning schemes and poisonous arrows of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, such as Liu Shaoqi, who incited the masses to fight against each other. The revolutionary masses, with deep hatred, settled accounts with Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes. They were determined to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight the enemy together. Inspired by the plenum report, these seven counties established revolutionary committees within a few days.

The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary masses in Fujian Province, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Fujian, achieving one victory after another. In August this year, the provincial revolutionary committee was established. In the face of the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Fujian, a small handful of class enemies went to great lengths to sabotage revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and to hinder the deep development of struggle, criticism, and transformation. In this fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the revolutionary masses throughout the province, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee and with the support of the People's Liberation Army, firmly executed the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, launching a fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies. They deeply criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" and smashed the cunning plots of the class enemies, making revolutionary committees emerge one after another.

Under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's instruction that the working class must lead everything, factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the province selected a large number of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went in batches to large, medium, and small schools and other units that had not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. Under the leadership of the working class, these units further achieved and consolidated revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

"The people have no army, and the people have nothing." The three services of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian frontline units firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses. They fought shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses throughout the province, striking hard at the sabotage activities of a small handful of class enemies, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and making great contributions to the people.

Currently, the broad military and civilian population of Fujian Province are deeply studying and propagating the public report of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, earnestly implementing the various battle tasks proposed by the plenum, determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao and advance bravely to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　党的十二中全会公报极大地鼓舞了福建军民
　　福建省各级革委会普遍成立
    全省除金门县外，所有的专区、市、县，绝大多数工矿企业和农村人民公社都成立了革委会。二十万军民在福州集会庆祝，决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社福州十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，福建省除金门县以外，九个专区、市，六十六个县全部成立了革命委员会。全省绝大多数的工矿企业和农村人民公社也成立了革命委员会。
    十一月九日，在海防前线的英雄城市——福州，福建省和福州市二十万军民隆重举行集会，热烈欢呼全省除金门县以外全部成立革命委员会。这次大会是一次欢庆胜利的大会，也是进一步落实全会提出的战斗任务，在全省掀起斗、批、改高潮的动员大会。广大革命群众抬着伟大领袖毛主席巨幅画像，手拿红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼着“坚决贯彻党的十二中全会的伟大战斗号召！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“我们要随时准备解放金门、马祖！随时准备解放台湾！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号，浩浩荡荡地涌向会场。福建省、福州市革命委员会和人民解放军驻福州部队负责人出席了大会，并讲了话。省革委会负责人在会上宣读了《福建省革命委员会关于深入宣传、坚决贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的决定》，号召全省军民进一步全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务。
    党的十二中全会公报发表的喜讯传到福建以后，一个波澜壮阔的学习、宣传、贯彻全会公报的革命热潮，立即在全省迅速兴起。正在酝酿建立革命委员会的清流、宁化、古田、大田、惠安、闽清、建阳七个县的革命群众，在全会公报发表以后，迅速办起了以学习全会公报为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，连续举行革命大批判大会，声讨党内头号走资派刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，大力促进革命三结合的早日实现。广大革命群众通过学习和批判，大大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，一致认识到过去两派群众长期打“内战”，是刘少奇等党内一小撮走资派耍阴谋，放毒箭，挑动群众斗群众造成的。革命群众怀着刻骨仇恨，清算了刘少奇的反革命罪行。他们决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，团结起来，共同对敌。在全会公报的鼓舞下，这七个县在几天时间内，就全部成立了革命委员会。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。福建省工人、贫下中农和广大革命群众，在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对刘少奇及其在福建的代理人进行了英勇顽强的斗争，取得一个又一个胜利，于今年八月份成立了省革命委员会。在福建无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好的形势下，一小撮阶级敌人千方百计地破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，破坏斗、批、改的深入开展。在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，全省广大革命群众，在省革委会的领导下，在人民解放军的支持下，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，深刻地批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，使各级革命委员会联翩出现。
    在毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大指示指引下，全省各厂矿企业选派大批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，分批开进大、中、小学校和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。在工人阶级领导下，这些单位进一步实现和巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军福建前线部队三军指战员，坚决执行毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，同全省广大革命群众并肩战斗，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，加强了无产阶级专政，为人民立下了巨大的功勋。
    目前，福建全省广大军民正深入学习、宣传党的十二中全会公报，认真落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
