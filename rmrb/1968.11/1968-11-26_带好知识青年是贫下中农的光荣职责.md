Inspired by Chairman Mao's great call to "all those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should be glad to go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where there is much that can be done," batch after batch of revolutionary young intellectuals, brimming with revolutionary enthusiasm, have gone to the countryside to settle down and receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically welcome and firmly support this revolutionary action.

Chairman Mao teaches us: In the entire process of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the transformation of intellectuals is a major issue. The re-education of young intellectuals is a necessity for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a necessity for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a necessity for preventing capitalist restoration and ensuring that the socialist iron rice bowl remains unchanged for generations to come. The Party and Chairman Mao have placed the heavy responsibility of re-educating young intellectuals on the shoulders of the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the greatest trust placed in the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must not shirk this responsibility. Educating the new recruits on the agricultural front and cultivating them into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is a glorious task and sacred duty of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

To educate young intellectuals well, the primary task is to help them study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, cultivating in them an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To educate young intellectuals well, we must help them forge and transform themselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Through class education, we must raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, helping them to completely change their old ideas, to love what the poor and lower-middle peasants love, and to hate what the poor and lower-middle peasants hate, truly uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants in thought and emotion.

To educate young intellectuals well, we must help them carry out thorough criticism and repudiation of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," and responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, we must guide them to link the criticism with the actual class struggle and their own ideological reality, carrying out a criticism of the revisionist educational line, eliminating the poisonous influence of the revisionist educational line, and raising their political and ideological awareness.

Young intellectuals must bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching: "If you want the masses to understand you and to unite with you, you must make up your mind to undergo long and even painful struggles." They must be prepared to endure long and painful struggles, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and respectfully learn from them. Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong and in the vast expanse of the new socialist countryside, they will temper and grow.

    带好知识青年是贫下中农的光荣职责
    在毛主席的“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”伟大号召的鼓舞下，一批又一批革命知识青年满怀革命豪情，到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育。他们这种革命行动，贫下中农热烈欢迎，坚决支持。
    毛主席教导我们：在整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，对知识分子的改造是一个极大的问题。对知识青年的再教育，这是在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的需要，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的需要，是防止资本主义复辟、保证社会主义铁打江山千秋万代永不变色的需要。党和毛主席把对知识青年再教育的重担放在工人阶级和贫下中农的肩上，这是对工人阶级和贫下中农的最大信任。我们决不能嫌“麻烦”，当负担。带好农业战线上这支新兵，把他们培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，这是贫下中农的光荣任务，神圣职责。
    带好知识青年，首要的是帮助知识青年活学活用毛泽东思想，培养他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级感情。
    带好知识青年，就是要帮助知识青年在无产阶级文化大革命中，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中努力锻炼、改造自己，通过进行阶级教育，提高他们的阶级斗争、路线斗争觉悟，使他们彻底改变旧思想，爱贫下中农所爱，恨贫下中农所恨，真正在思想感情上，和贫下中农打成一片。
    带好知识青年，就是要帮助他们搞好革命大批判，彻底批臭刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。要遵照毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，响应党的八届十二中全会提出的伟大号召，引导他们联系阶级斗争的实际，联系自己思想的实际，开展对修正主义教育路线的批判，肃清修正主义教育路线的流毒，提高他们的政治思想觉悟。
    知识青年要牢记毛主席“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”的教导，做好经受长期痛苦磨练的思想准备，老老实实地拜贫下中农为师，恭恭敬敬地向贫下中农学习，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，在广阔的社会主义新农村的天地里锻炼、成长。
