Inspired by the great battle call of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, members of the revolutionary committee of Shanghai China Clock Factory and revolutionary workers throughout the factory, filled with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, are working with the spirit of "seizing the day" to swiftly implement the various battle tasks proposed by the plenum. A new high tide of seizing the revolution, promoting production, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging throughout the factory.

In the days before the communiqué was issued, the factory's revolutionary committee was mobilizing all revolutionary workers to, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories and on the whole party building, compare the factory's actual situation, conduct a review, find gaps, propose measures, and draft a plan for the struggle, criticism, and transformation for the rest of the year. One evening, the joyous news of the issuance of the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee arrived, and the revolutionary workers throughout the factory were full of vigor and enthusiasm, immediately launching a mass movement to study the communiqué. The more they studied, the clearer their minds became, and the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm grew. Everyone unanimously agreed that the central committee plenary session, personally presided over by the great leader Chairman Mao, was a meeting of great historical significance. The communiqué has already stipulated the various battle tasks that must be completed to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well. The comprehensive implementation of these tasks is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the basis of studying the communiqué, the factory revolutionary committee mobilized all revolutionary workers to, in accordance with the factory's actual situation, compare with the various tasks proposed in the communiqué, propose measures for implementation item by item, and further revised the plan for the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory.

Now, the factory is focusing on party building and rectification to launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory. The factory has held a party building and rectification study class with over 130 participants, and each workshop has also conducted extensive and in-depth criticism of the revisionist party-building line in classes. They use a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders within the factory as live materials to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the "theory of tamed tools," the "theory of entering the party to become an official," the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," the "theory of the fusion of public and private interests," and the "theory of party peace." The broad revolutionary workers are determined, in accordance with the requirements of the communiqué, to further mobilize the masses, seize the time, and seriously do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and dig out all the handful of counter-revolutionaries hidden among the masses.

This factory is one of the advanced units in the city for streamlining organizations. Originally, the factory had nine departments and one office, with over 120 full-time departmental personnel. After two rounds of streamlining, the factory revolutionary committee has only two groups: the political work group and the administrative group, with only 33 full-time personnel. Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's series of instructions on streamlining organizations, transferring departmental personnel, and sending cadres to labor, they fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line and decided to carry out a third round of streamlining, reducing the number of full-time personnel to 23.

Inspired by the communiqué, the factory's production has also taken on a new look. On the day after the communiqué was issued, the parts group, wooden case group, and assembly group all created the highest daily output since the factory was established, with some production groups doubling their output. A mass technical revolution movement is rising. Revolutionary workers are determined to complete this year's state production plan ahead of schedule by one and a half months.

    上海中国钟厂革命职工坚决响应党的十二中全会的伟大号召
    以只争朝夕的精神掀起斗批改新高潮
    本报讯　在党的八届十二中全会的伟大战斗号召鼓舞下，上海中国钟厂革命委员会成员和广大革命职工，怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，雷厉风行，迅速落实全会提出的各项战斗任务。现在一个狠抓革命、猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新高潮正在全厂蓬勃兴起。
  在公报发表的前几天，这个厂的革命委员会正在发动全厂革命职工，根据伟大领袖毛主席关于工厂斗、批、改的几个阶段和整党建党的一系列最新指示，对照本厂的实际情况，进行检查总结，找差距、提措施，拟订年内全厂斗、批、改的计划。一日晚上，党的八届十二中全会公报发表的喜讯传来，全厂革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，立即掀起了群众性大学公报的热潮，他们越学心里越亮堂，越学革命劲头越大。大家一致认为，伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的这次中央全会是一次具有极其伟大历史意义的会议，公报已经规定了搞好斗、批、改必须完成的各项战斗任务，这些任务的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。在大学习的基础上，工厂革命委员会又发动全厂革命职工，根据本厂实际情况，对照公报提出的各项任务，逐条提出落实的措施，进一步修订了全厂斗、批、改的计划。
    现在，这个厂正以整党建党为中心，掀起全厂斗、批、改的新高潮。全厂举办了有一百三十多人参加的整党建党学习班，各车间也都以班组为单位，广泛深入地开展了对修正主义建党路线的革命大批判，他们以本厂的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派为活材料，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”、“入党做官论”、“群众落后论”、“公私溶化论”、“党内和平论”等反动谬论。广大革命职工决心根据公报的要求，进一步发动群众，抓紧时间，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把混在群众中的一小撮反革命分子统统挖出来。
    这个工厂是全市精简机构的先进单位之一。原来全厂设有九科一室，脱产的科室人员一百二十多人，经过两次精简，厂革委会下只设政工组、办事组两个组，脱产人员只有三十三人。最近他们学习了毛主席关于精简机构、下放科室人员、干部下放劳动的一系列指示后，狠批了刘少奇反革命修正主义的企业管理路线，决定进行第三次精简，脱产人员减少到二十三人。
    在公报的鼓舞下，这个工厂的生产也出现了崭新的面貌。在公报发表的第二天，零件组、木壳组、装配组，日产量都创造了建厂以来最高纪录，有的生产小组产量翻了一番。一个群众性的技术革命的运动正在兴起。革命职工决心提前一个半月超额完成今年国家生产计划。
