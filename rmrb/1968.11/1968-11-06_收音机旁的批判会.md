On November 1, the special bulletin of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was broadcast over the radio. The soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on duty on Train No. 22 gathered around the radio, listening and discussing. Everyone unanimously agreed that the communiqué spoke to the hearts of the soldiers, fully reflecting the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and politically pronouncing the death sentence on the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. It is truly wonderful!

After listening to the broadcast, Platoon Leader Chen Huaibao decided to hold a criticism meeting to pursue and attack the fallen dog Liu Shaoqi, who had long spread the poison of revisionism.

The newly enlisted soldier Ou Anqing angrily said: In the past, I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "theory of joining the party to become an official." I thought that it was hard work in the army, striving to join the party, and in the future, I would "have a way out." Under the guidance of this wrong thinking, I worked sometimes enthusiastically and sometimes half-heartedly, and my mood was sometimes high and sometimes low. Later, with the help of comrades and leaders, I studied Chairman Mao's great teaching that "we Communists are not to become officials, but to make revolution," and only then did I get out of the quagmire of bourgeois ideology. Liu Shaoqi's black methods are extremely vicious. We revolutionary soldiers must not fall for his tricks.

As Ou Anqing's words fell, the old soldier Jiang Zhengfu continued: This great traitor Liu Shaoqi, out of the reactionary class nature, vigorously advocated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." His evil purpose is to attempt to disarm us ideologically and turn us into politically "confused" people. Because my class consciousness is not high, I was poisoned by him, and the string of class struggle in my mind is not tight. I wrongly thought that the class struggle now is almost done, so I was not content with my service. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "we must never forget class struggle," I solved this "old difficult problem." Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is opium that corrupts people's souls. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize it deeply and thoroughly.

The criticism meeting became more and more lively. Comrades spoke one after another, criticizing Liu Shaoqi to the point where he had no face left and was stinking. The new soldier Zhao Chunjie, who usually did not speak much, also stood up and angrily said: "The extremely wicked Liu Shaoqi advocates the 'theory of reading books to become an official' and the 'theory of merging public and private interests.' In the past, I was poisoned by him and thought that my cultural level was high, and I would definitely have an 'advantage' in the army. When I was assigned to the artillery platoon, I felt 'cheated' and was listless all day. Later, after studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' I realized that for the revolution, everything is the same, and only then did I correct my attitude and became active in my work. Look! Liu Shaoqi's methods of harming people are so despicable! We will not rest until we thoroughly criticize and expose him and eliminate his poison!"

The criticism meeting raised the comrades' awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and swore: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, with practical actions, repel Liu Shaoqi and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    收音机旁的批判会
    十一月一日，从收音机里传来了中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报的特大喜讯，在二十二次列车上值勤的解放军某部一班战士围聚在收音机旁，一边收听一边讨论，大家一致认为，公报字字句句说到了战士的心坎上，它充分反映了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，它从政治上宣判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的死刑。真是好得很！
    听完了广播后，班长陈怀保针对刘少奇长期散布的修正主义流毒，决定展开一个批判会，穷追猛打落水狗刘少奇。
    刚入伍的新战士欧安青愤怒地说：过去我受了刘少奇所散布的“入党做官论”的毒害，认为到部队辛苦一点，争取入党，将来“吃得开”。在这种错误思想的指导下，工作时冷时热，情绪时高时低。后来在领导同志和战友们的帮助下，我学习了毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的伟大教导，才从资产阶级思想的泥坑里拔出来。刘少奇的黑手段真是毒辣透顶，我们革命战士决不能上他的当。
    欧安青的话音刚落，老战士蒋正甫接着说：刘少奇这个大工贼，出于反动阶级本性，大力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”。他的罪恶目的就是妄图使我们从思想上解除武装，变成政治上的“糊涂虫”。由于我阶级觉悟不高，受了他的毒害，头脑里阶级斗争的弦拉得不紧，错误地认为现在的阶级斗争搞得差不多了，因此，不安心服役。学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，才把这个“老大难”的问题解决了。刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”是腐蚀人们灵魂的鸦片烟。我们要用毛泽东思想把它批深批透。
    批判会越开越热烈，同志们你一言，我一语，把刘少奇批得体无完肤，臭不可闻。坐在一边的新战士赵纯洁本来是话不多的，也站了起来，愤怒地说：“罪大恶极的刘少奇鼓吹什么‘读书做官论’、‘公私溶化论’。以前，我就是在他的毒害下，才认为自己文化水平高，到部队一定能占‘便宜’。分配我下炮班就感到‘吃亏’了，整天委靡不振。后来学习了《为人民服务》，才使我认识到为革命干什么都一样，才端正了态度，工作也积极了。看！刘少奇害人的手法是多么卑鄙啊！不彻底把他批倒批臭，肃清其流毒，绝不罢休！”
    批判会使同志们提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们站在毛主席像前宣誓：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以实际行动来回击刘少奇，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
