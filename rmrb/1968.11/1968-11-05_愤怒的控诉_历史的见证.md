Some members of the workers' union and workers' militia from Wuhan during the Great Revolution listened repeatedly to the broadcast of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee. They were extremely excited and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They said that the plenary session decided to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, uprooting this major disaster hidden within the party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This wise decision makes us feel both relieved and vindicated; our wishes have been fulfilled!

On this joyous day when the people of the entire nation enthusiastically welcome the publication of the plenary session's communiqué, these members of the workers' union and workers' militia from the Great Revolution era, as historical witnesses and based on their personal experiences, angrily accused and criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi for his heinous crimes of betraying the working class and the revolution in Wuhan more than 40 years ago. The 68-year-old retired worker and former member of the workers' militia, Zhong Hangshan, said that the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has always been on the side of the capitalists, representing the interests of the capitalists and the reactionary Kuomintang.

In 1927, the workers of the Wuhan region, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, organized the workers' militia to fight against imperialism. With hoes and sticks, we reclaimed the concessions of Japan, Germany, Britain, France, and other imperialist countries in Hankou. Those arrogant invaders were terrified by the revolutionary actions of the Chinese working class and fled in disarray, some with their tails between their legs, others hiding in warships on the Yangtze River. The guns of the concession police were also seized by us workers.

Just as we were continuously achieving victories and holding our heads high, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, under the guise of a "labor leader," emerged, forcing our workers' militia to disband and surrender our weapons to the reactionary Kuomintang. Half a month later, the reactionary Kuomintang ruthlessly carried out a brutal massacre of the unarmed working class and revolutionary people. The vigorous workers' movement in the Wuhan region was thus betrayed by the great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi! After the retired worker and former deputy squad leader of the workers' militia, Zhou Heliang, angrily accused the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi of betraying the workers' movement, he looked deeply at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and said emotionally, "Chairman Mao is the great savior of all the people of China. It is Chairman Mao who led the people of the entire nation to achieve revolutionary victory, and we have today!"

After studying the communiqué of the plenary session, the old union members and workers' militia members unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely carry out the great calls issued by the plenary session, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    愤怒的控诉　历史的见证
    武汉地区一些大革命时期的工会会员和工人纠察队员，从广播中一遍又一遍地收听了党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报。他们无比兴奋地热烈欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说，全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，拔掉了埋藏在党内的这个大祸害。这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利。这个英明决定使我们解气又解恨，我们的心愿实现了！
    在全国革命人民热烈欢呼全会公报发表的大喜日子里，这些大革命时期的工会会员和工人纠察队员们，以历史见证人的身份和亲身经历，纷纷愤怒控诉和批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇四十多年前在武汉出卖工人阶级，背叛革命的滔天罪行。六十八岁的退休老工人、当年的工人纠察队员钟恒山说，刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，从来就是和资本家一个鼻孔出气，他代表的是资本家和国民党反动派的利益。
    一九二七年，我们武汉地区的工人，在中国共产党的领导下，组织起工人纠察队，同帝国主义作斗争，凭着扁担、木棍收回了日、德、英、法等帝国主义国家在汉口的租界。那些平日作威作福的侵略者被中国工人阶级的革命行动吓得屁滚尿流，有的夹着尾巴逃跑了，有的龟缩在长江上的军舰里。租界巡捕的枪也被我们工人缴了。
    正当我们不断取得胜利、扬眉吐气的时候，刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼打着“工运领袖”的招牌跳了出来，强迫我们工人纠察队解散，向国民党反动派交枪。半月以后，国民党反动派就肆无忌惮地对手无寸铁的工人阶级和革命人民实行灭绝人性的大屠杀，武汉地区轰轰烈烈的工人运动就这样被大工贼刘少奇出卖了！退休老工人、当年工人纠察队分队的一位副队长周何亮愤怒控诉了工贼刘少奇出卖工人运动的滔天罪行以后，无限深情地望着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，激动地说：“毛主席是全中国人民的大救星。是毛主席领导全国人民取得了革命的胜利，我们才有了今天！”
    老工会会员和工人纠察队员们学习了全会公报后，一致表示，坚决执行全会发出的各项伟大号召，永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
