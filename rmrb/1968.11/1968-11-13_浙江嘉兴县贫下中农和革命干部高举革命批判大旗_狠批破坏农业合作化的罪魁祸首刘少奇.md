The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang, have firmly responded to the great battle call of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, continuing to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. They severely criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for betraying the Party and the country. This has pushed the county's revolutionary criticism to a new high. The poor and lower-middle peasants especially severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crime of slashing agricultural cooperatives in 1955 and crazily sabotaging the cooperativization movement. Through revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in the entire county have further heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further deeply carry out the mass movement of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," and continuously consolidate and develop the collective economy of the people's communes. They will turn the people's communes into bright red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Jiaxing County on the Hangjiahu Plain has a glorious history of revolutionary struggle. In 1921, our great leader Chairman Mao went to South Lake in Jiaxing and successfully concluded the First National Congress of the Party. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaxing County, with their deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, firmly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize." After land reform, they quickly launched the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the spring of 1955, the entire county established more than two thousand agricultural cooperatives. Just as the agricultural cooperativization movement was flourishing, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, issued a black directive to slash the cooperatives. One-third of the agricultural cooperatives in Jiaxing County were slashed, and the agricultural cooperativization movement was seriously disrupted. This crime of Liu Shaoqi was severely criticized by our great leader Chairman Mao at that time. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaxing County launched a revolutionary criticism against Liu Shaoqi, the chief culprit of slashing the cooperatives in 1955. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the entire county launched a new high tide of criticizing Liu Shaoqi for slashing the cooperatives.

The Workers' Congress, Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, and Revolutionary Representatives' Congress of Jiaxing County jointly held a mass meeting of ten thousand people to thoroughly settle accounts with the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. Representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants at the meeting angrily exposed: In 1955, Liu Shaoqi sent his agents to Jiaxing to collude with a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old county committee. They carried out the "experience of slashing cooperatives," set up "models of slashing cooperatives," held "training classes for slashing cooperatives," and created counter-revolutionary public opinion such as "cooperatives were established too early, too many, and too fast." More than one-third of the more than two thousand cooperatives in the entire county were slashed, forcing 35% of the poor and lower-middle peasants to withdraw from the cooperatives and go it alone. This greatly dampened the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the road of cooperativization and caused great damage to the agricultural cooperativization movement in the entire county. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses participating in the mass meeting of ten thousand people, through the great criticism, further aroused their deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi. Shouts of "Resolutely overthrow the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi!" and "Resolutely support expelling Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever!" echoed over South Lake.

In recent days, the vast rural people's communes in various places of Jiaxing County have also held revolutionary criticism while studying and publicizing the communiqué, with production brigades as units. Dongzha Commune's production brigades have generally seen a mass criticism fever. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the seven production brigades of Dongfeng Brigade exposed: Under Liu Shaoqi's black directive to slash the cooperatives, most of the thirteen cooperatives that had already been established here were forcibly slashed, and the number of cooperative households decreased from more than three hundred to more than sixty. They angrily criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crime of strangling the agricultural cooperativization movement. A member of the brigade revolutionary committee and the former chairman of Qili Store Cooperative, Zhang Defu, said, "Our primary cooperative originally had twenty-two households. Under the poisonous influence of the black wind of slashing cooperatives, half of the cooperative members were forcibly withdrawn, and the remaining eleven poor and lower-middle peasants decided to establish the cooperative. As a result, the collective spring grain yield was twice as high as that of the withdrawn individual households. After completing the state procurement task, each household sold more than a thousand jin of surplus grain on average, while the individual households could not even complete the state-procured task." Zhang Defu said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the cooperative is doing very well. But the big villain Liu Shaoqi picked up an axe and slashed our cooperative, trying to make us go back and suffer again. He angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy. We must criticize him down and stink him up, so that he can never rise again." The poor and lower-middle peasants of the various production brigades of Jianxin Brigade in Dongzha Commune also refuted Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "without industrialization, agricultural collectivization is fundamentally impossible" with ironclad facts. The deputy director of the brigade revolutionary committee, Wang Zhonggen, said: "Our brigade was the first to establish a collective farm in the entire county, but the black work team sent by Liu Shaoqi scared the poor and lower-middle peasants by saying: 'You want to establish a farm, do you have agricultural machinery? Is it like the Soviet collective farm?' They forcibly slashed our farm with the excuse of no mechanization. However, we remember Chairman Mao's teaching of collectivization first and mechanization later and established the cooperative again. Now, we have more and more large and medium-sized agricultural machinery such as water pumps, cement boats, electric plows, and electric threshers, which proves that Chairman Mao's instructions are extremely wise and correct. Liu Shaoqi opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and does not allow us to take the road of collectivization. His evil purpose is to attempt to restore capitalism." The decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoke all his positions within and outside the Party reflects the common wish of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Many production brigades in the rural areas of Jiaxing County also, in conjunction with the current autumn harvest distribution work, severely expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents for sabotaging the cooperativization movement and undermining the foundation of the collective economy. The poor and lower-middle peasants of many production brigades in Nanhu, Fengqiao, and Shuangqiao Communes, after criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crime of crazily sabotaging the collective economy, left more public accumulation in the distribution and left more collective reserve grain after completing the state procurement task, thus consolidating and strengthening the collective economy. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaxing County expressed that they would definitely respond to the call of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, resolutely purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of Liu Shaoqi, further carry out the mass movement of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," and turn the people's communes into bright red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　浙江嘉兴县贫下中农和革命干部高举革命批判大旗
　　狠批破坏农业合作化的罪魁祸首刘少奇
    新华社杭州十二日电　浙江省嘉兴县广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决响应党的八届十二中全会公报的伟大战斗号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党、叛国的罪行，把全县的革命大批判推向了一个新的高潮。广大贫下中农特别狠批了刘少奇一九五五年大砍农业合作社、疯狂破坏合作化运动的滔天罪行。全县贫下中农和革命群众通过革命大批判，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步深入开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，不断巩固和发展人民公社集体经济，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    杭嘉湖平原上的嘉兴县，有着光荣的革命斗争历史。一九二一年，我们伟大领袖毛主席到嘉兴南湖，胜利开完了党的第一次全国代表大会。嘉兴县广大贫下中农怀着对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，坚决响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，在土地改革以后迅速开展了农业互助合作运动。一九五五年春，全县办起了两千多个农业合作社。正当农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的时候，党内头号走资派刘少奇却下了个大砍合作社的黑指示，嘉兴县的农业合作社被砍掉了三分之一，农业合作化运动受到严重破坏。刘少奇的这一罪行，当时就受到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的严厉批判。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，嘉兴县的广大贫下中农就对一九五五年大砍合作社的罪魁祸首刘少奇展开了革命大批判。八届十二中全会公报发表以后，全县各地又掀起了批判刘少奇大砍合作社的新高潮。
    嘉兴县工代会、贫代会、红代会联合召开了彻底清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇罪行的万人大会。贫下中农代表在大会上愤怒揭发：一九五五年，刘少奇通过他的代理人派工作组到嘉兴，和旧县委内一小撮走资派勾结起来，大搞“砍社经验”，大树“砍社样板”，大办“砍社训练班”，大造“合作社搞早了，搞多了，搞快了”等反革命舆论，全县两千多个合作社被砍掉三分之一以上，强使百分之三十五的贫下中农退社单干，极大地打击了贫下中农走合作化道路的积极性，使全县的农业合作化运动遭受到极大的破坏。参加万人大会的贫下中农和革命群众通过大批判，更加激发起对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，“坚决打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“坚决拥护把刘少奇永远开除出党！”的怒吼声响彻南湖上空。
    嘉兴县各地农村的广大人民公社，连日来也纷纷以生产队为单位，在学习、宣传公报的同时，深入开展革命大批判。东栅公社各生产队普遍出现了群众性的大批判热潮。东风大队七个生产队的贫下中农揭发：在刘少奇大砍合作社的黑指示下，这里已经办起来的十三个合作社绝大部分都被强制砍掉，入社户数由三百多户减少到六十多户。他们愤怒批判了刘少奇扼杀农业合作化运动的这一滔天罪行。大队革委会成员、原七里店合作社社长张德富说，我所在的初级社，原来共有二十二户，在砍社黑风的毒害下，有一半社员被强迫退社，剩下的十一户贫下中农下定决心办社，结果集体种的春粮比退出单干的产量高出一倍，完成国家征购任务后每户平均多卖一千多斤余粮，而单干户连国家规定的征购任务都完不成。张德富说：我们贫下中农听毛主席的话，合作社办得蛮好，而大坏蛋刘少奇拿起斧头，砍我们合作社，想让我们走回头路，受二遍苦。他愤怒地说，刘少奇是我们贫下中农的死对头，我们一定要把他批倒批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。东栅公社建新大队各生产队的贫下中农还用铁的事实驳斥刘少奇所谓“不实现工业化，农业根本不可能实现集体化”的反动谬论。大队革委会副主任王忠根说：我们大队在全县最早办起了集体农庄，可是刘少奇派来的那个黑工作组，却吓唬贫下中农说：你们要办农庄，有没有农业机械？象不象苏联的农庄？他们硬是用没有机械化的罪名，把我们的农庄砍掉了。但是我们记住毛主席先集体化、后机械化的教导，又办起了合作社。现在，我们抽水机、水泥船、电犁、电动脱粒机等大中型农业机械越来越多，事实证明毛主席的指示无比英明正确。刘少奇对抗毛主席的革命路线，不准我们走集体化道路，他的罪恶目的，就是妄想复辟资本主义。党的八届十二中全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消他在党内外的一切职务，这反映了我们贫下中农的共同心愿。
    嘉兴县农村许多生产队还结合当前秋收分配工作，狠揭狠批刘少奇和他的代理人破坏合作化运动，大挖集体经济墙脚的罪行，用实际行动发展壮大集体经济。南湖、凤乔、双桥等公社许多生产队的贫下中农，批判了刘少奇疯狂破坏集体经济的罪行后，在分配中多留公共积累，在完成国家征购任务后多留集体贮备粮，使集体经济得到巩固壮大。嘉兴县的广大贫下中农表示，一定要响应党的八届十二中全会公报的号召，坚决肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义流毒，进一步开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
