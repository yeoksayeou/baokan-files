In Mao Zedong Thought study classes!

	Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly,
	Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism transforms people,
	Illuminating hearts brightly,
	New people, new deeds, new chapters.

	On the morning of August 31, the entire cadre and community members of Changfu Village, Fengjiazhuang Commune, Guangzong County, Hebei Province, held up the Red Book and red flags, with drums and gongs resounding and songs echoing, one community member leading a black donkey adorned with a large red flower at the front, everyone following behind. The community members walked and talked, "Yes! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and give the donkey to the brother brigade."

	The story is as follows: On the morning of October 10 last year, the eighth brigade of Changfu Village sent a horse-drawn carriage to Quzhou County to buy cabbages. On the way back, they suddenly discovered a small donkey following the carriage. No matter how many times they drove it away, it would not leave and followed them all the way home.

	This August, during the Mao Zedong Thought study class, community member Pan Xiu Ren raised the issue of the donkey, immediately sparking a debate. Some said, "The donkey followed the carriage, it's not like we stole it. When it first came, it was still small, and we've raised it for about ten months, can we just give it away?" Others said, "Currently, it's the busy season for the three autumn harvests, and our brigade doesn't have many draft animals, let's talk about it after the autumn." However, the majority of poor and lower-middle-class community members advocated: the donkey is not ours, it should be returned to its original owner. Poor peasant community member Li Shanwen said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: completely selfless and dedicated to others. We found a donkey and hid it for our own use, isn't this completely self-serving and not dedicated to others? What's the difference between this and the traitor Liu Shaoqi's selfishness?" Poor peasant community member Pan Chengzhi said, "This path of 'selfishness' cannot be taken! In my opinion, if we don't return the donkey to the brother brigade, it's disloyal to Chairman Mao."

	Then, everyone recalled the situation after the earthquake in 1966. At that time, all over the country, people sent grain and vegetables over thousands of miles to support us, especially the class brothers from the Tibet region, who traveled thousands of miles over mountains and rivers to send a large number of fine horses. This is such deep proletarian feelings! Through the discussion, everyone realized: whether to return the donkey or not is a big issue of whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao and whether to walk the socialist path. Immediately, the deputy brigade leader was sent to Quzhou County to make contact and post a notice to claim the donkey.

	After a few days, two community representatives from Yuezhuang Brigade, Huoqiao Commune, Quzhou County, brought the red book and a letter of thanks to Changfu Village. The representative of the original owner, Wang Xuezeng, said excitedly at the meeting, "Now we are not here to take the donkey, but to learn the true experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The donkey was small when it came and could not be used, you have taken care of it for about ten months, we cannot let the brother brigade raise it for free, we must leave enough feed money." The brigade cadres and community members all said, "We want Mao Zedong Thought, we want the communist style, we want the socialist path, we will not take a single cent, we are all one family, no need for formalities." Thus, in the song "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao," everyone led the donkey and sent the representatives of the original owner out of the village.

### “我们要的是共产主义风格！”

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    “我们要的是共产主义风格！”
    毛泽东思想闪金光，斗私批修人变样，
    照得人心亮堂堂，新人新事新篇章。
    八月三十一日上午，河北省广宗县冯家寨公社常阜村大队全体干部和社员，手捧宝书高举红旗，锣鼓喧天歌声阵阵，一个社员牵着一头戴着大红花的黑油油的毛驴走在前面，大家簇拥在后面。社员们一面走一面说：“对！我们就得听毛主席的话，把驴送给兄弟队。”
    事情是这样的：去年十月初的一天拂晓，常阜村大队第八队派马车到曲周县购买白菜，在回来的公路上，突然发现一头小毛驴跟在车后。几次轰撵它老是不走，就这样一直跟到家。
    今年八月份，在毛泽东思想学习班上，社员潘修仁提出了驴的问题，当即引起了一场辩论。有的说：“驴是跟车来的，又不是咱偷来的，刚来的时候还小，喂养了十来个月，能白给他们？”也有的说：“当前三秋大忙季节，咱队里牲口又不多，秋后再说吧！”但大多数贫下中农社员主张：驴不是自己的，应当送给原主。贫农社员李善文说：“毛主席教导我们：毫不利己专门利人。咱们拾了一头驴，暗藏下自己使用，这不成了专门利己、毫不利人了吗？这跟叛徒刘少奇的利己主义有啥区别！”贫农社员潘成志说：“这条‘私’字路可走不得！叫我说，不把驴送给兄弟队，就是对毛主席他老人家不忠。”
    接着，大家又回忆了一九六六年地震后的情况，那时全国各地都千里粮食万里菜地支援我们，特别是西藏地区的阶级兄弟，不远几千里跋山涉水送来了大批好马，这是多么深厚的无产阶级感情啊！通过讨论，大家认识到：这驴送还是不送，是关系到忠不忠于毛主席，走不走社会主义道路的大问题。当即选派副队长去曲周县联系，并张贴广告招领。
    几天之后，曲周县霍桥公社岳庄大队两位社员代表，携带红彤彤的宝书和感谢信来到了常阜村。失主代表王学增在会上激动地说：“现在我们不是来领驴，而是向你们取活学活用毛泽东思想的真经来了。驴来的时候还小，不能使用，你们操劳了十来个月，不能让兄弟队白给养大，一定要留足饲养费。”大队干部社员都说：“我们要毛泽东思想，要共产主义风格，要社会主义道路，钱是分文不留，一家人不说两家话。”就这样在“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的歌声中，大家牵着毛驴一直把失主代表送出村外。　（广常宣　广革政）
