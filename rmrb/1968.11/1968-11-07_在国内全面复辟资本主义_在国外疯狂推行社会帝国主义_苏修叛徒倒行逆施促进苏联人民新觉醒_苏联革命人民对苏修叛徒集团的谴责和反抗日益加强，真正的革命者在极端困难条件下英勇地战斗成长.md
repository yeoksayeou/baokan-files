The Soviet revisionist clique is intensifying its crimes of completely restoring capitalism at home and fiercely pursuing social imperialism abroad, which is further awakening the Soviet revolutionary people. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk recently took the opportunity of the 51st anniversary of the October Revolution to boast about their so-called "achievements," attempting to portray themselves as the "heirs" of the October Revolution. However, these clumsy tactics cannot conceal their traitorous and exploitative faces. The Soviet revolutionary people's condemnation and resistance against the Soviet revisionist clique are growing stronger, significantly shaking the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to become mature and ensure victory. The counter-revolutionary crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist clique serve as a profound negative lesson for the Soviet people, greatly promoting the development of the struggle of the Soviet revolutionary people against the Soviet revisionist clique. The "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union has recently published a series of articles and distributed leaflets, calling on the Soviet proletariat and laboring people to overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and restore proletarian dictatorship, demonstrating the heroic spirit and determination of the Soviet proletariat to carry out a proletarian revolution.

In the past year, the Soviet revisionist clique has taken a series of measures in the Soviet Union to further intensify the complete restoration of capitalism. They have further accelerated the so-called "economic reforms" in various sectors of the Soviet national economy, carrying out a comprehensive capitalist reorganization of the Soviet national economy, further intensifying the exploitation and oppression of the Soviet people from all aspects. At the same time, they have also intensified political and ideological control over the Soviet people, using every means to maintain their increasingly unstable reactionary rule.

Soviet workers and the broad masses of laboring people have exposed and denounced these crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique with a large number of facts. A worker pointed out that the so-called "economic reform" of the Soviet revisionist clique gives many privileges to the heads of enterprises, while placing the laboring people in a completely powerless and enslaved position. He said this "reform" is "not socialism, but capitalism." As the "new system" is further implemented, many factories, mines, and enterprises in the Soviet Union have laid off a large number of workers. This has caused the Soviet laboring people to lose their livelihood. A worker angrily said, "A factory suddenly lays off hundreds of people," "How will the laid-off workers continue to live? How will the lives of other workers be guaranteed in the future?" A young worker said, "In the Soviet Union, there is indeed a high-income class, and it is very obvious." A combine harvester driver angrily denounced the Brezhnev, Kosygin traitor clique, saying they "are on two different paths with the people, the people move forward, and they retreat." These workers and agricultural laborers' denunciations of the Soviet revisionist clique's crimes of completely restoring capitalism reflect the anger in the hearts of the Soviet revolutionary people.

In the past year, the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union have been politically oppressed and economically exploited more cruelly, and other realities of class struggle have made more workers, peasants, and ordinary laborers realize the true nature of the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule. They pointed out that in the current Soviet Union, the state power "is in the hands of the enemies of the people," "proletarian dictatorship, the power of the laboring class, no longer exists." A Soviet employee pointed out bluntly that in the Soviet Union now there is no socialist power, but "it is a fascist dictatorship."

Many people pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique represents the interests of the bourgeois privileged class, and under their reactionary rule, the Soviet laboring people have no democracy and freedom. A Soviet female worker angrily said, "Our leaders and ordinary people are two classes." A Soviet trade union worker pointed out, "Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang are fake Leninists, genuine new-type bourgeoisie, they have betrayed Leninism." An old Soviet worker complained that now in the Soviet Union, "workers have no right to speak. Workers expressing legitimate dissatisfaction with the leadership will be discriminated against, suppressed, and harassed by the leadership, making them unable to stay in the factory, even being dismissed." A carpenter revealed that someone was imprisoned just for saying "Stalin is a Marxist-Leninist."

On the eve of the 51st anniversary of the October Revolution, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk shamelessly claimed that they are "firmly advancing along the path of the October Revolution," saying that the Soviet people regard the policies of the Soviet revisionist clique as "their own policies," and so on. In the face of the Soviet revolutionary people's angry denunciations and exposures, how much are these wild talks worth? Isn't it very clear!

In the past year, the Soviet revisionist clique has been ruthlessly implementing an anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary line internationally, committing many new heinous crimes. They collude with and compete against U.S. imperialism, attempting to redivide the world. Not long ago, with the tacit approval and support of U.S. imperialism, they openly sent troops to carry out a fascist occupation of Czechoslovakia. At the same time, they have been making arrogant military threats against the socialist Albania and the peoples of the Balkan countries. Towards the Chinese people, who have achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revisionists are even more terrified and enraged. Recently, they have intensified armed provocations against China, collaborating with U.S. imperialism to intensify the anti-China encirclement, massively deploying troops along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders, and continuously creating border tensions. In this way, the bandit face of Soviet social imperialism has been unprecedentedly exposed to the peoples of the world and the Soviet people.

Among the great Soviet revolutionary people who have been educated for a long time by Lenin and Stalin, more and more people are now realizing the reactionary nature of Soviet social imperialism. They strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists' recent armed occupation of Czechoslovakia. Soviet people angrily wrote slogans on the streets such as "Hands off Czechoslovakia!" and "Occupying troops get out of Czechoslovakia!" expressing their extreme indignation at the Soviet revisionists' fascist actions. Among the Soviet troops occupying Czechoslovakia, many soldiers refused to serve the Soviet revisionist clique to suppress the Czechoslovakian people! Some people angrily deserted the Soviet army, and some openly refused to carry out orders. Some Soviet revolutionary people pointed out deeply, "The leadership of the Soviet Union is now colluding with U.S. imperialism. It openly occupies Czechoslovakia, which is no different from the actions of U.S. imperialism."

The Soviet revisionists' frenzied anti-China actions have aroused even stronger opposition among the Soviet revolutionary people. Many ordinary Soviet workers, peasants, and soldiers have expressed their feelings of fraternal friendship with the Chinese people when they come into contact with Chinese comrades. They are very indignant about Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk's attempt to threaten China with military force. In Moscow, a disabled soldier publicly questioned a Soviet revisionist who was inciting anti-China sentiments: "Why are you against China? 'America is our enemy, China is our friend.'" These words made the revisionist stammer and look embarrassed. A Soviet worker said, "We Soviet people love the Chinese people the most. The current Soviet government does not represent the Soviet people, let Brezhnev and Kosygin go to hell!" A Soviet officer said, "The great friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China is unbreakable," "Honest Soviet soldiers will definitely stand with the Chinese people."

The broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union, who are suffering double hardships, have been closely watching the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They have a deeper understanding of the bitter lessons of the Soviet proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people regaining power after losing it. An old sailor sighed deeply, "After the proletariat seizes power, it must carry out such a cultural revolution to consolidate the power and prevent the emergence of a new bourgeoisie and new exploiters." Another Soviet person pointed out profoundly, "Revisionism is the root cause of all the disasters of the Soviet people today."

Now, the Soviet revolutionary people are becoming more and more awakened. Despite the brutal persecution and suppression by the Soviet revisionist traitors, they are continuously strengthening their struggle against the Soviet revisionist rule. A Soviet worker said, "The Soviet Union must carry out a second revolution. We must rebel against the Brezhnev, Kosygin clique and reestablish a Soviet Socialist Republic under proletarian dictatorship." An unemployed old worker, filled with hatred towards the Soviet revisionist clique, said, "We must rise up, fight, and let the red star over the Kremlin shine again."

The true revolutionaries in the Soviet Union are bravely fighting and growing under extremely difficult conditions. Their various forms of struggle, like sharp swords, directly strike at the heart of the Soviet revisionist clique, powerfully exposing the traitors' and running dogs' heinous crimes of completely restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union and colluding with U.S. imperialism to attempt to redivide the world. Recently, the "Stalin Group" issued a call to arms in a leaflet to the Soviet proletariat and laboring people: "Fight against all privileges! Fight against the exploitation of the ruling clique—the new bourgeoisie 'employer' clique! Overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeois degenerationist clique! Join the battle to restore Soviet proletarian dictatorship!" These calls have greatly boosted the fighting will of the Soviet revolutionary people, encouraging them to bravely fight to overthrow the new tsars of the Kremlin.

Great leader Chairman Mao taught, "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union is now usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the people, the broad masses of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The Soviet working class and the broad masses of laboring people, who have the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and seize the power back into their own hands. The great banner of Lenin and Stalin will surely fly again in the sky of the homeland of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union!

    在国内全面复辟资本主义　在国外疯狂推行社会帝国主义
    苏修叛徒倒行逆施促进苏联人民新觉醒
    苏联革命人民对苏修叛徒集团的谴责和反抗日益加强，真正的革命者在极端困难条件下英勇地战斗成长
    新华社六日讯　本社记者报道：苏修叛徒集团变本加厉地在国内全面复辟资本主义、在国外疯狂推行社会帝国主义的滔天罪行，正在促进苏联革命人民的进一步觉醒。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流最近趁着十月革命五十一周年的机会，大肆吹嘘他们的所谓“成就”，妄图把自己打扮成十月革命事业的“继承者”。但是，这些拙劣手法掩饰不了他们的叛徒、工贼的丑恶嘴脸，苏联革命人民对苏修集团的谴责和反抗日益加强，有力地动摇着苏修叛徒集团的反动统治。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。苏修叛徒集团干的种种反革命罪行，对苏联人民是极为深刻的反面教育，大大促进了苏联革命人民对苏修叛徒集团的斗争的发展。苏联“斯大林小组”最近几个月发表一系列文章和散发的传单，号召苏联无产阶级和劳动人民起来推翻苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政，表现了苏联无产阶级的英雄气概和进行无产阶级革命的决心。
    最近一年来，苏修叛徒集团在苏联国内又采取了一系列措施，变本加厉地全面复辟资本主义。他们在苏联国民经济各部门进一步加紧推行所谓“经济改革”，对苏联国民经济进行全面的资本主义大改组，从各个方面进一步加紧对苏联人民的剥削和压榨。同时，他们在政治上和在思想文化领域内也加紧了对苏联人民的压迫和控制，千方百计地维持他们越来越不稳定的反动统治。
    苏联工人阶级和广大劳动人民用大量事实揭露和控诉了苏修集团的这些罪行。一位工人指出，苏修叛徒集团的所谓“经济改革”，给企业头目以许多特权，而把劳动人民置于完全无权和被奴役的地位。他说这种“改革”“不是社会主义，而是资本主义”。随着“新体制”的进一步推行，苏联许多厂矿企业大量解雇工人。这使苏联劳动人民失去了生活保障。一位工人气愤地说：“一个工厂一下子解雇几百人”，“被解雇的工人怎样继续生活下去？别的工人的生活今后又怎样保障？”一位青年工人说：“在苏联确实有高薪阶层，而且非常明显。”一位联合收割机手愤怒地谴责勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团说，他们“同人民走的是两条道路，人民往前走，他们往后退”。这些工人和农业劳动者对苏修集团全面复辟资本主义的罪行的谴责，反映了苏联革命人民心中的怒火。
    一年来，苏联广大劳动人民政治上倍受压迫、经济上遭受越来越残酷的剥削的情况，以及其他种种阶级斗争的现实，使更多的工人、农民和其他普通劳动者认清了苏修反动统治的实质。他们指出，在目前的苏联，国家政权“掌握在人民的敌人手里”，“无产阶级专政，劳动阶级的政权，已经不存在了”。一位苏联职员一针见血地指出，在苏联现在已经没有社会主义政权，而“是法西斯专政”。
    许多人指出，苏修叛徒集团是代表资产阶级特权阶层的利益的，在他们的反动统治下，苏联劳动人民没有民主和自由。一位苏联女工愤愤地说：“我们这里的领导人和普通人是两个阶级”。一位苏联工会工作者指出：“勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一伙是假列宁主义者，真正的新型资产阶级，他们背叛了列宁主义”。一位苏联老工人控诉说，现在苏联“工人根本没有权利讲话。工人对领导表示正当的不满，就会遭到领导歧视、压制和刁难，使他在工厂呆不下去，甚至被开除。”一位木工揭露说，有人因为说“斯大林是马列主义者”就被关进监狱。
    在十月革命五十一周年前夕，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流厚颜无耻地标榜他们“坚定地沿着十月革命的道路前进”，说什么苏联人民把苏修集团的政策看作“是自己的政策”，等等。在苏联革命人民愤怒的谴责和揭露面前，他们的这一派胡说八道，究竟还值几文钱，这不是十分清楚的么！
    苏修叛徒集团最近一年来，在国际上穷凶极恶地执行反华、反共、反人民、反革命路线，犯下了许多新的滔天罪行。他们同美帝国主义互相勾结又互相争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界。不久前，他们在美帝的默契和支持下，公然出兵对捷克斯洛伐克实行法西斯占领。同时，他们对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，以及巴尔干各国人民进行蛮横的武力威胁。对已经在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了决定性胜利的中国人民，苏修更是怕得要死，恨得要命。最近以来，他们加紧对中国进行武装挑衅，配合美帝大搞反华包围圈，在中苏中蒙边境大量驻扎军队，不断制造边境紧张局势。这样，就把苏修社会帝国主义的强盗面目，空前地暴露在世界人民和苏联人民的面前。
    在受过列宁、斯大林长期教育的伟大苏联革命人民中，现在越来越多的人认清了苏修社会帝国主义的反动本质。他们对苏修最近武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克表示强烈的谴责。苏联人民愤怒地在街头刷出了“不许干涉捷克斯洛伐克！”“占领军滚出捷克斯洛伐克！”等标语，对苏修的法西斯行径表示了无比的愤慨。侵占捷克斯洛伐克的苏军中，有不少士兵拒绝为苏修叛徒集团镇压捷克斯洛伐克人民效劳！有的人愤怒地脱离了苏军，有的人公开拒绝执行命令。一些苏联革命人民深刻地指出：“苏联的领导现在同美帝国主义搞在一起。它公开侵占捷克斯洛伐克，这同美帝国主义的行径没有什么两样”。
    苏修叛徒疯狂反华，在苏联革命人民中引起了更加强烈的反对。许多普通的苏联工人、农民和军人在同中国同志接触中表达了苏联人民对中国人民兄弟友谊的感情。他们对勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流妄图用武力威胁中国表示十分愤慨。在莫斯科，一位残废军人当众质问一个煽动反华情绪的苏联修正主义分子：你们为什么反对中国？“美国才是我们的敌人，中国是我们的朋友”。这几句话问得那个修正主义分子张口结舌，狼狈不堪。一位苏联工人说：“我们苏联人民最热爱中国人民。现在的苏联政府不能代表苏联人民，让勃列日涅夫和柯西金见鬼去吧！”一位苏联军官说：“伟大的苏中两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的”，“正直的苏联军人一定会同中国人民站在一起”。
    正在遭受二遍苦的苏联广大劳动人民，一直在密切注视着中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们热情欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。他们对苏联无产阶级和广大劳动人民在取得政权后又重新丧失政权的惨痛教训，有了越来越深刻的体会。一位老海员无限感慨地说，“在无产阶级取得政权以后，一定要进行这样一场文化大革命，才能巩固政权，才能防止产生新的资产阶级和新的剥削者。”另一位苏联人深刻地指出：“修正主义是今天苏联人民一切灾难的根本原因。”
    现在，苏联革命人民正日益觉醒，他们不顾苏修叛徒们的残酷迫害和镇压，正在不断加强反对苏修统治的斗争。一位苏联工人说：“苏联一定要进行第二次革命，我们一定要造勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团的反，重新建立一个无产阶级专政的苏维埃社会主义共和国。”一位失业老工人怀着对苏修集团的无比愤恨说：“我们要翻身，要战斗，要让克里姆林宫上空的红星重放光芒。”
    苏联真正的革命者正在极端困难的条件下英勇地战斗、成长。他们开展的各种形式的斗争，象一把把利剑，直刺苏修集团的心脏，有力地揭露了这些叛徒、工贼在苏联全面复辟资本主义和在国际上勾结美帝妄图重新瓜分世界的滔天罪行。最近“斯大林小组”在一张传单中向苏联无产阶级和劳动人民发出了响亮的战斗号召：“为反对一切特权而斗争！为反对统治集团——新的资产阶级‘雇主’集团的剥削而斗争！”“打倒资产阶级蜕化分子集团的专政！投身到重建苏联无产阶级专政的战斗中去！”这些号召大大振奋了苏联革命人民的战斗意志，鼓舞他们为打倒克里姆林宫的新沙皇而英勇战斗。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联工人阶级和广大劳动人民，必将彻底推翻苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，把政权重新夺回到自己的手中。列宁、斯大林的伟大旗帜一定会在十月革命的故乡苏联的上空重新飘扬！
