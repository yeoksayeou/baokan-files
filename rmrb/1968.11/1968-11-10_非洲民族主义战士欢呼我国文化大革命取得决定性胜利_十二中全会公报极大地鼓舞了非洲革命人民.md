The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has greatly encouraged African nationalist fighters who are steadfastly fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Recently, various nationalist organizations and freedom fighters in some African countries have issued statements or spoken out, enthusiastically hailing the great historical significance of this plenary session and the great, decisive victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao.

On November 8, the Public Affairs Secretary of the Zimbabwe African National Union, Mukono, issued a statement in Dar es Salaam: "It was Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people in waging armed struggle, defeating Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, these reactionary forces did not surrender easily; they have always tried to stage a comeback through their agents who have infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party and government to seize key positions. Chairman Mao launched the Cultural Revolution, mobilizing the broad masses of workers and peasants to expose and criticize the running dogs of capitalism and imperialism, and to root them out."

The statement said: "During the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao often issued directives to the people. Under the leadership and guidance of Chairman Mao, workers and peasants can strike hard at revisionism wherever it appears. Now that the Chinese proletariat has won the victory, we, the Zimbabwe African National Union, pay tribute to them."

The statement emphasized: "The great victory of the Cultural Revolution proves that as long as the people grasp the great thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong and act according to the great thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, they can overcome all difficulties and smash all kinds of reactionaries and imperialists."

The statement said: "Because of this great victory, China will certainly provide greater assistance to the fighting forces in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and will forever be the vanguard and a powerful base for the revolutionary people of the whole world."

The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Wish Chairman Mao Zedong eternal life!"

On November 7, the Acting Chairman of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), Leballo, issued a statement in Dar es Salaam, hailing the expulsion of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Communist Party of China. The statement said that it was precisely because of the correct Mao Zedong Thought that the Cultural Revolution in China achieved decisive victories, consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevented capitalist restoration, and ensured socialist construction.

The statement called out: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the thoughts of Chairman Mao!" "Down with all traitors and running dogs of imperialism and modern revisionism!"

A Congolese (Kinshasa) freedom fighter, Bidia, said: "The convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a major event of world significance. All revolutionaries in the world, especially the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, are enthusiastically hailing it."

Bidia said: "We warmly welcome the decision to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever."

He added: "Under the leadership and guidance of the great leader, the contemporary great Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China has become the undisputed vanguard of the world revolution. The Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct party."

Another Congolese (Kinshasa) freedom fighter, Zashari, said: "All true revolutionaries in the world are very happy about the great victory of the Twelfth Plenary Session. This session is a historic event of great significance. The victorious conclusion of this session has brought the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the history of world revolution into a new stage, that is, the stage of comprehensive victory."

Zashari stressed: "In the Cultural Revolution, the masses exposed the evil plots and tricks of the traitor Liu Shaoqi. This is a great victory of the thoughts of the contemporary great Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao."

He pointed out: "This session is a fatal blow to the Soviet modern revisionists that they cannot withstand."

Zashari said that the Congolese (Kinshasa) freedom fighters regard this brilliant victory as their own victory, as the victory of the people of all countries in the world in their struggle.

Finally, these two Congolese (Kinshasa) freedom fighters called out: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

A Cameroonian freedom fighter named Tati said: "The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is an important document of historical significance."

He said: "The important resolutions made by this session, especially the resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, to remove all his positions within and outside the Party, and to continue to settle accounts with the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, is a blow to the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique. This opens up a broad prospect for the Chinese people to achieve even greater victories on their forward march."

Tati said: "The session has made a correct assessment of the international situation. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The people of all countries in the world, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will be more resolute than ever to fight against the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique."

    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟公共事务书记穆科诺八日在达累斯萨拉姆发表新闻公报说：“是毛主席领导中国人民展开武装斗争，战胜了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。但是这些反动势力并没有轻易投降，他们一直企图通过钻进中国共产党和政府内窃踞要职的他们的代理人卷土重来。毛主席发动中国广大工农群众参加文化大革命，来揭露和批判资本主义和帝国主义的忠实走狗，并把他们揪了出来。”
    公报说：在文化大革命过程中，“毛主席经常向人民发出指示。在毛主席的领导和指引下，工人和农民能够狠狠地打击在任何地方出现的修正主义。现在中国无产阶级取得了胜利，我们津巴布韦非洲民族联盟向他们致敬”。
    公报着重指出：“无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利证明，人民只要掌握了毛泽东主席的伟大思想，照毛泽东主席的伟大思想办事，就一定能克服一切困难，并粉碎形形色色的反动派和帝国主义者。”
    公报说：“由于这一伟大胜利，中国必将给予非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲的战斗力量更大的援助，并将永远是全世界革命人民的先锋和强大的基地。”
    新闻公报最后高呼：“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会代理主席勒巴洛七日在达累斯萨拉姆发表新闻公报欢呼把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出中国共产党。公报说，正是由于有正确的毛泽东思想，中国的无产阶级文化大革命才取得了决定性胜利，巩固了无产阶级专政，防止了资本主义复辟和保证了社会主义建设。
    公报高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛主席的思想万岁！”“打倒一切叛徒以及帝国主义和现代修正主义的走狗！”
    刚果（金）自由战士比迪亚发表谈话说：“中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的召开，是一件具有世界重大意义的大事。世界上所有的革命者，特别是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民，都为之热烈欢呼。”
    比迪亚说：“我们热烈欢迎把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党。”
    他接着说：“在伟大领袖、当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的领导和教导下，中国共产党已成为世界革命的无可置疑的先锋队。中国共产党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。”
    另一名刚果（金）自由战士扎沙里说：“世界上一切真正的革命者，对十二中全会的伟大胜利，都感到十分高兴。这次会议是极其重大的历史事件。这次全会的胜利闭幕，使世界革命史上空前的无产阶级文化大革命进入到一个崭新的阶段，即全面胜利的阶段。”
    扎沙里强调指出：“在无产阶级文化大革命中，人民群众揭露了内奸刘少奇的恶毒的阴谋诡计。这是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的思想的一个伟大胜利。”
    他指出：“这次会议对于苏联现代修正主义者来说，是一个无法招架的致命打击。”
    扎沙里说，刚果（金）自由战士把这一辉煌胜利看作是自己的胜利，看作是斗争中的世界各国人民的胜利。
    最后，这两位刚果（金）自由战士高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    一位名叫塔蒂的喀麦隆自由战士说：“中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报，是具有历史意义的重要文献。”
    他说：“这次全会作出的重要决议，特别是关于把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙的罪行的决议，是对以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者的一个打击。这为中国人民在前进的道路上取得更伟大的胜利开辟了广阔的前景。”
    塔蒂说：“全会对国际形势作了正确的估计。正如毛主席所指出的，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的全世界各国人民，将比以往任何时候都更加坚决地同以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修集团为首的现代修正主义者展开斗争。”
