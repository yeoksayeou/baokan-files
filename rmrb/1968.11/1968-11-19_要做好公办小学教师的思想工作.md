To implement the revolutionary proposal by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu to "transfer all public primary schools to the production brigades for management," the key lies in raising the ideological awareness of public primary school teachers. The People's Liberation Army's personnel stationed in rural areas to support leftist elements should not only propagate this revolutionary proposal but also do a good job in the ideological work among public primary school teachers. This is because transferring primary schools from public management to collective management and changing teachers from receiving salaries to earning work points is an unprecedented new thing. It is a thorough break with the revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, deeply touching the souls of every public primary school teacher, and will inevitably lead to a sharp struggle between two ideologies and two paths.

Public primary school teachers, having been poisoned by the revisionist educational line, will find it difficult to quickly break free from the "private" mindset. They do not yet fully understand the significance of the issues raised by this revolutionary proposal. The personnel supporting leftist elements must persist in arming the minds of public primary school teachers with Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can they raise their awareness and consciously use the "public" mindset to overcome the "private" mindset, following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment.

Therefore, we suggest that the personnel supporting leftist elements in various places should do meticulous ideological work for primary school teachers, helping them raise their awareness, correct their attitudes, overcome selfishness, and establish public-mindedness. They should gladly return to their production brigades to become collectively managed teachers.

　　要做好公办小学教师的思想工作
    要实现侯振民、王庆余两位同志关于“所有公办小学下放到大队来办”的革命建议，关键在于提高公办小学教师的思想觉悟。人民解放军驻农村支左人员除了应宣传这一革命建议外，更要作好公办小学教员的思想工作。因为，把小学由公办改为民办，让教员由拿工资改为记工分，这是前所未有的新事物，是与刘少奇修正主义教育路线彻底决裂的大革命，深刻地触及每个公办小学教师的灵魂，必然要出现一场尖锐的两种思想、两条道路的斗争。公办小学教师由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，一时还不容易迅速跳出“私”字的小圈子，对这一革命建议所提出的问题的意义还认识不足，支左人员只有坚持用毛泽东思想武装公办小学教师的头脑，才能使他们提高认识，自觉地用“公”字打倒“私”字，跟上毛主席的战略部署。
    所以，我们建议各地支左人员，应该给小学教师作艰苦细致的思想工作，帮助他们提高认识，端正态度，破私立公，愉快地回到本大队当民办教师去。
