Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and denunciation of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi has surged in Hunan. This tide is magnificent and powerful. Revolutionary masses and local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army throughout the province, from cities to the countryside, have set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism everywhere. They are denouncing Liu Shaoqi with both their mouths and pens, thoroughly settling the accounts of his heinous crimes of betraying the party and the country, and fiercely criticizing his counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They are determined to thoroughly purge his counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Various levels of revolutionary committees have played a strong leading role in carrying out the revolutionary criticism. Leaders of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and responsible comrades of the local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army have gone deep into various regions, joining the masses in denouncing Liu Shaoqi and taking the lead in criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. At a mass meeting held in Changsha on the 12th to denounce Liu Shaoqi, attended by more than 200,000 people, Li Yuan, the head of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, systematically criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the revolution and attempting to restore capitalism.

In Guangfu Commune, Tianhua Production Brigade of Changsha County, where Liu Shaoqi had once "stayed," in Huaminglou of Ningxiang County, where Liu Shaoqi's landlord family lived, and in some units where Liu Shaoqi had once come to Hunan to spread poison, the broad revolutionary masses there are filled with indignation and burning with rage, denouncing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes based on their personal experiences. Revolutionary committees at the provincial, municipal, and county levels have held several meetings in Huaminglou to denounce, expose, and criticize Liu Shaoqi. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Huaminglou are full of fighting spirit, fiercely denouncing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi. They excitedly said: The Party Central Committee's decision to expel this old counter-revolutionary Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever is too wise, we support it a thousand times, ten thousand times! In recent days, the masses here have been denouncing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in unison. His crimes and evidence fully prove that Liu Shaoqi is a faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, and the representative of the bourgeoisie and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said, we must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end!

In Tianhua Production Brigade, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants who have suffered from Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism, as well as revolutionary cadres who insisted on the socialist road and were labeled as a "counter-revolutionary clique" by Liu Shaoqi, are filled with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi. They are exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of using the name of "staying" to carry out the restoration of capitalism. During Liu Shaoqi's stay in this brigade, the collective enterprises established during the Great Leap Forward were all abolished, collective forests were distributed to individual households, and the original party branch secretary Peng Meixiu, who insisted on the socialist road, was persecuted to death. The blood-and-tear accusations of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade aroused great indignation among the masses. For days, the roar of "Down with Liu Shaoqi" echoed through the mountains of Tianhua.

In Xiangjiang Machinery Factory and Changjiang Smelting Plant in Zhuzhou City, the broad revolutionary workers at the denunciation meetings fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's evil activities of spreading poison in the factory in the spring of 1957. The workers, with a large number of vivid facts showing their love for Chairman Mao and socialism, refuted Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of "the masses are backward" and "the workers' ideal is to have more money and a higher position." The workers angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi is a big bastard with a mouth full of maggots! We, the working class, have the lofty ideal of realizing communism and the great ambition to lead everything with Mao Zedong Thought. Let Liu Shaoqi and his ilk go to hell!"

The military and people of Hunan, in the revolutionary criticism, unanimously denounced Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of consistently opposing the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and attempting to usurp the Party, the government, and the army. In Shaoshan, where the red sun rises, and in many places in Changsha such as Qinghuatan and the First Normal School, where Chairman Mao carried out revolutionary activities, the broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses are denouncing Liu Shaoqi. They said, Liu Shaoqi, this old counter-revolutionary, has always opposed and defamed the great Mao Zedong Thought. Under the planning of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan, some of the memorial sites of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities were demolished, some were long neglected, and some were even filled with Liu Shaoqi's private and black goods to oppose Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary masses said, "We must build the memorial sites of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities with the fastest speed, the greatest enthusiasm, and the best quality, so as to better spread the great Mao Zedong Thought. The more Liu Shaoqi fears Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must learn it. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, this running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, and make him never be able to turn over a new leaf!"

    据新华社长沙十七日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，一个狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判新高潮，已在湖南兴起。这个高潮波澜壮阔，声势浩大，全省广大革命群众和人民解放军当地驻军指战员，从城市到农村，到处都摆下了革命大批判的战场，人人口诛笔伐，彻底清算刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，决心全面肃清他的反革命修正主义思想，搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    各级革命委员会在开展革命大批判中充分发挥了坚强的领导作用。省革命委员会领导成员和人民解放军湖南驻军负责人等都分头深入各地区，同广大群众一起声讨刘少奇，带头批判反革命修正主义路线。十二日在长沙市举行的二十多万人愤怒声讨刘少奇的大会上，省革委会主任黎原同志系统地批判了刘少奇叛变革命和妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    在刘少奇曾经“蹲点”的长沙县广福公社天华大队，在刘少奇地主家庭所在地的宁乡县花明楼，以及刘少奇过去窜来湖南放过毒的一些单位，那里的广大革命群众对刘少奇更是满怀义愤，怒火如焚，纷纷以亲身经历控诉、批判刘少奇的反革命罪行。省、地、县各级革命委员会在花明楼举行了多次声讨、揭发、批判刘少奇的大会，花明楼的广大贫下中农斗志昂扬，狠揭猛批刘少奇。他们激动地说：党中央决定把刘少奇这个老反革命永远开除出党，太英明了，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！连日来这里万众声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，一桩桩罪行，一件件罪证，充分说明刘少奇是帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，是钻入党内的资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的总代表。广大贫下中农说，我们一定要彻底批倒批臭刘少奇，紧跟毛主席革命到底！
    在天华大队，身受刘少奇复辟资本主义之害的广大贫下中农，以及坚持走社会主义道路、被刘少奇打成“反革命集团”的革命干部，怀着对刘少奇的深仇大恨，大揭大批刘少奇在这里以“蹲点”为名，大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。党内头号走资派刘少奇在这个大队“蹲点”期间，把大跃进中创办起来的集体企业全部砍掉，集体山林下放到户，还把坚持走社会主义道路的原党总支书记彭梅秀迫害致死。这个大队贫下中农的血泪控诉，激起广大群众的无比愤怒，天华山山上山下，连日来“打倒刘少奇”的怒吼声震天动地。
    在株洲市湘江机器厂和长江冶炼厂，广大革命职工在声讨会上愤怒批判了刘少奇在一九五七年春窜来厂里放毒的罪恶活动。广大工人用工人阶级最热爱毛主席、最热爱社会主义的大量生动事实，痛斥了刘少奇在这里散布的“群众落后论”、“工人的理想就是钱多地位高”等谬论。工人们气愤地说：“刘少奇这个大坏蛋真是满嘴生蛆！我们工人阶级有实现共产主义的崇高理想，有靠毛泽东思想领导一切的雄心壮志，让刘少奇之流见鬼去吧！”
    湖南省军民在革命大批判中，一致愤怒地声讨了刘少奇一贯反对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想，妄图篡党篡政篡军的滔天罪行。在红太阳升起的地方韶山，在长沙市清水塘、第一师范等许多毛主席革命活动纪念地，广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和革命群众，纷纷狠批刘少奇。他们说，刘少奇这个老反革命一贯反对和诋毁伟大的毛泽东思想。在刘少奇及其在湖南代理人的策划下，毛主席革命活动纪念地有的被拆除，有的长年失修，有的竟被刘少奇塞进自己的私货、黑货，来同毛主席相对抗。广大革命群众说：“我们一定要以最快的速度、最大的热情、最好的质量，建设好毛主席革命活动纪念地，以便更好地传播伟大的毛泽东思想。刘少奇越怕毛泽东思想，我们越要学，我们一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把刘少奇这只帝、修、反的走狗彻底批臭，叫他永世不得翻身！”
