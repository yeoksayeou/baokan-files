	Washington, November 17, Xinhua News Agency: According to a report by the U.S. News Agency, on November 13, State Department spokesman Robert J. McCloskey, authorized by Acting Secretary of State Katzenbach, released a statement to the press. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	In recent days, several points have been raised regarding the arrangements for representatives to participate in the new Paris conference and the military actions taken by the United States and the other side. These points are mainly raised by the North Vietnamese representatives in some statements and speeches. It is important to clarify the situation.

	First, regarding the arrangements for representatives, our proposal to the North Vietnamese representatives is for a meeting between the two sides to discuss the peaceful settlement of Vietnam. On our side, it will be the Republic of Vietnam (Note: the South Vietnamese puppet regime) and the United States. When we made this proposal, we said that the North Vietnamese could include anyone they wish on their side. On the North Vietnamese side, they said that representatives of the National Liberation Front would participate in the meeting. It is understood that both sides will organize themselves according to their choices. However, we have made it clear from the beginning that we consider this arrangement to be bilateral, and we continue to do so. I am detailing this because it refutes the North Vietnamese claim that we have agreed to hold a four-party or four-sided conference.

	As the President has made very clear and as we have said on many occasions, the attendance of the National Liberation Front does not in any way imply recognition of this front. We do not consider the National Liberation Front to be an independent entity; the fact is clear that it is an organization controlled by Hanoi. The National Liberation Front will participate in the meeting as chosen by Hanoi.

	Second, I will now discuss the issue of reconnaissance activities over North Vietnam. As the Department of Defense has clearly stated, we are continuing reconnaissance activities as needed. What I want to add is the diplomatic context, especially regarding some statements made by North Vietnamese representatives, which suggest that continuing such activities is a violation of the understandings reached before the bombing halt.

	The facts are simple. The activities we have agreed to stop are all bombing and shelling and "all other actions involving the use of force." The reason we have repeatedly used this exact wording, which contrasts with the wording proposed by the North Vietnamese, is that reconnaissance is not an action involving the use of force. The North Vietnamese accepted this wording and used this wording in their statements to the press regarding the actions taken by the United States after the bombing halt.

	Third, finally, I will discuss the remarks made by Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford yesterday regarding military actions in or near the demilitarized zone and the indiscriminate attacks on major cities in the South.

	Regarding the major cities in the South, we and they know what is required, and we are indeed paying very close attention to the situation.

	Regarding the demilitarized zone, I want to emphasize that we take very seriously the verified incidents that have occurred since November 9: North Vietnamese forces have fired from positions within the demilitarized zone at allied forces south of the demilitarized zone. Our representatives in Paris have strongly drawn the attention of the North Vietnamese to this situation. As the President and Secretary Clifford have made clear, our position is that if the demilitarized zone is abused, serious negotiations will not be possible.

　　美国国务院十一月十三日的声明
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国新闻处报道，美国国务院发言人巴奇十一月十三日在代理国务卿卡曾巴赫的授权下，向报界散发了一项声明。声明全文如下：
    最近几天，就参加新的巴黎会议的代表安排以及美国和对方采取的军事行动提出了几点。这几点主要是北越代表们在一些声明和讲话中提出的。现在把事情明白摆出来是重要的。
    一、首先，关于代表安排，我们向北越代表提出的建议是由两方举行会议讨论越南的和平解决。在我们一方将是越南共和国
  （编者按：即南越傀儡集团）和美国。我们在提出这个建议时说，北越人可以把他们希望包括的任何人包括在他们一方。在北越人方面，他们说，民族解放阵线的代表将参加会议。据谅解，双方将按照它们的选择自行组织。但是，我们从一开头就清楚表明，我们认为这种安排是两方性的，而且我们现在继续这样认为。我之所以详细说明这一点，是因为这反驳了北越正在提出的关于我们已同意举行四方或四方面会议的说法。
    正如总统所非常清楚地表明和我们在许多场合所说的，民族解放阵线的出席绝不牵涉到以任何方式承认这个阵线。我们并不认为民族解放阵线是一个独立的实体；事实很清楚，它是一个由河内控制的组织。民族解放阵线将作为河内所选择者参加会议。
    二、现在我谈谈在北越上空的侦察活动问题。正如国防部早已清楚表明的那样，我们正在根据需要继续侦察活动。我所要补充的是关于外交背景的情况，特别是关于北越代表们发表的一些声明，这些声明暗示，继续进行这种活动是违反停炸前达成的谅解的。
    事实是简单的。我们答应停止的活动是一切轰炸和轰击和“所有其他涉及使用武力的行动”。之所以向北越人一再使用这一同北越人所提出的字眼形成对照的确切的措词，只是因为侦察并不是一个涉及使用武力的行动。北越人接受了这个措词，并在停炸后他们就美国所采取的行动向报界发表的声明中使用了这个措词。
    三、最后我谈谈国防部长克利福德昨天就非军事区或非军事区附近的军事行动和对南方主要城市进行的不分青红皂白的袭击发表的谈话。
    对于南方主要城市，我们和他们都知道要求的是什么，我们的确正在非常密切地注意局势。
    关于非军事区，我希望强调指出我们严重看待自从十一月九日以来发生的经过核实的这样一些事情：北越部队从非军事区内的据点向非军事区以南的盟国部队开火。我们在巴黎的代表们已经强烈地提请北越人注意这种情况。正如总统和克利福德部长所清楚表明的，我们的态度是，如果滥用非军事区，就不可能进行认真的会谈。
