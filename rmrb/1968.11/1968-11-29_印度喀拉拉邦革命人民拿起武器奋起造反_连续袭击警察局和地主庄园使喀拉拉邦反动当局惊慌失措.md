The revolutionary people of Kerala State in India have recently taken up arms and launched a series of attacks on reactionary police stations and landlord estates, causing the reactionary authorities in Kerala to panic.

According to reports, in the early hours of the 24th, over 300 revolutionary masses in Pulparai, Kalikot County, Kerala State, bravely attacked a reactionary police radio station. Armed with knives, spears, homemade guns, explosives, and other weapons, the masses quickly surrounded the radio station, killing and injuring six reactionary police officers and policemen on the spot. They then withdrew voluntarily.

Prior to this, in the early hours of the 22nd, about 400 revolutionary masses in Kerala State bravely attacked the police station in Trichur. They cut the telephone lines of the police station, smashed a police car, and threw homemade hand grenades at the sentry posts. Before withdrawing voluntarily, the revolutionary masses distributed revolutionary propaganda materials.

On the 25th, approximately 200 revolutionary peasants in the Kuttnad region, armed with knives and homemade guns, bravely attacked a large landlord's estate. They angrily destroyed the landlord's lair and seized the grains and other resources that the landlord had plundered from the peasants. The landlord's son and his henchmen fled in a panic.

The reactionary government of Kerala was terrified by the revolutionary actions of the people and on the 25th, immediately ordered all police stations in the state to be on alert day and night. The order stipulated that ministers of the state government must have armed police escorts when they go out.

The Kerala State government is a black model of the "parliamentary road" advocated by the revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India and the Danji traitor clique. These revisionists shout about "seeking benefits for the people," but in reality, they, like the Indian reactionaries, oppose and suppress the people, fearing that the people will rise up in revolution, especially fearing that the people will launch armed revolutionary struggles. On the 25th, the Kerala State Committee Secretary of the Danji traitor clique, Kumaran, in Trichur, maliciously slandered and attacked the recent revolutionary actions of the people in this state. He absurdly claimed that the attacks by the revolutionary people of India on the Trichur and Pulparai police stations were "unreasonable" and that such actions would only "weaken democracy." This fully exposed the ugly appearance of these traitors, who are frantically desperate as their "parliamentary road" dream suffers a heavy blow.

    印度喀拉拉邦革命人民拿起武器奋起造反
    连续袭击警察局和地主庄园使喀拉拉邦反动当局惊慌失措
    丹吉叛徒集团大肆污蔑和攻击人民群众的革命行动充分暴露其丑恶嘴脸
    新华社二十七日讯新德里消息：印度喀拉拉邦革命人民最近拿起武器，连续袭击反动的警察局和地主庄园，使喀拉拉邦反动当局惊慌失措。
    据报道，二十四日凌晨，在喀拉拉邦卡利卡特县内的普尔帕里地方，革命群众三百多人英勇地袭击了一个反动警察当局的无线电台。群众拿着匕首、长矛、土制枪枝、炸药和其它武器，迅速包围了电台，当场打死打伤反动警官和警察六人。然后，这些群众主动撤退。
    在此以前，二十二日凌晨，喀拉拉邦革命群众约四百多人，还英勇袭击了特利切里的警察局。他们切断了警察局的电话线，砸毁了一辆警车，向岗哨投掷了土制手榴弹。革命群众在主动撤离前散发了革命宣传品。
    二十五日，这个邦的大约二百名革命农民使用匕首和土制枪枝，英勇袭击了库塔纳德地区的一家大地主的庄园，他们愤怒地捣毁了这个大地主的巢穴，没收了大地主从农民手中掠夺的粮食和其它物资。这个大地主的儿子和他的狗腿子慌忙逃跑。
    喀拉拉邦反动政府被人民群众的革命行动吓破了胆，二十五日急忙下令全邦各警察局昼夜戒备。命令规定，邦政府的部长们外出活动时，要有武装警察保镖。
    喀拉拉邦政府是印共修正主义分子和丹吉叛徒集团推行“议会道路”的黑样板。这些修正主义分子嘴里叫喊什么“为人民谋利益”，实际上他们和印度反动派一样，敌视和压迫人民，害怕人民起来革命，特别是害怕人民开展革命武装斗争。二十五日，丹吉叛徒集团的喀拉拉邦委员会书记库马兰在特利丘尔大肆污蔑和攻击这个邦的人民群众最近采取的革命行动。他胡说什么印度革命人民对特利切里和普尔帕里警察局的袭击是“没有道理的”，这种行动只会“削弱民主”。这充分暴露了这些叛徒的“议会道路”迷梦遭到沉重打击而气急败坏的丑态。
