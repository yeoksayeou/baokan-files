	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is Completely Necessary and Extremely Timely
	Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory Revolutionary Committee

	Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and extremely timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is the most profound and penetrating summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, expressing the sentiments of our working class. The struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory fully proves this point.

	In the past, Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, under the control of the counter-revolutionary clique of Peng Zhen and his agents within the factory, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. They openly defied Chairman Mao's series of directives on medical and health work. They did not develop or produce medicines urgently needed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for the prevention and treatment of common and frequently occurring diseases. They did not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers but instead focused on producing so-called high-level, cutting-edge products with high output value and high profits to serve the bourgeoisie.

	The capitalist roaders in our factory also peddled Liu Shaoqi's black goods of "profits first," claiming that "the main business does not make money, but the sideline does." They did not care about the people's needs and produced a large number of off-plan products, squeezing out the commonly used medicines that the people urgently needed. From 1958 to 1960, they produced seven high-output, high-profit products with a total output value of 160 million yuan, accounting for 32.6% of the factory's total output value during this period. These products were all medicines for treating rare diseases. For the medicines urgently needed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, they used the excuse of low output value, troublesome production, and no profit to be made, refusing to produce them and disregarding the health of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We proletarian revolutionaries, holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," have exposed those capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the Party, seized back the power they usurped, and criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in medical and health work. We firmly follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside" and produce a large number of medicines needed in the countryside. For example, products such as "Baby Peace" and "Eye Drops," which are highly welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, currently have a daily output nearly three times higher than before the Cultural Revolution, and the cost has been significantly reduced. To provide convenience for "barefoot doctors," we have also changed some large-packaged medicines into small packages and changed liquid and powder preparations into tablets. To better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, we have organized a survey team consisting mainly of outstanding old workers, with revolutionary cadres and technical personnel participating, to go deep into the countryside to widely solicit the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, "barefoot doctors," and commune health stations. We have preliminarily understood the characteristics of commonly used medicines in rural areas and the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants on some medicines, providing a basis for improving medicine production. At the same time, we have also collected many folk and secret prescriptions, analyzed and studied them, and developed four new medicines.

	"The question of for whom is a fundamental question," and it is also the focal point of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in the industrial sector. The living class struggle in our factory fully proves: this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and extremely timely. It is precisely because Chairman Mao timely initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that our country can be guaranteed to remain red for thousands of years. It is precisely because we have seized back the leadership power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party that we can, according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, turn the pharmaceutical factory into a genuine socialist enterprise and better serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。
    完全必要　非常及时
    北京制药厂革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”毛主席的光辉指示，是对无产阶级文化大革命最深刻、最精辟的总结，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。北京制药厂两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就充分证明了这一点。
    过去，北京制药厂在彭真反革命集团及其在制药厂的代理人的把持下，大力推行叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，公开对抗毛主席关于医药卫生工作的一系列指示。他们不试制、不生产为防治广大工农兵常见病、多发病所急需的药品，不为工农兵服务，而大搞高产值、高利润的所谓高级、尖端产品，为资产阶级老爷服务。
    我厂走资派还大肆贩卖刘少奇“利润挂帅”的黑货，胡说什么：“正业不赚钱，副业赚钱。”他们根本不管人民需要不需要，大量生产计划外的产品，挤掉了人民急需的常用药物生产。从一九五八年到一九六○年两年间，就生产了七种高产值、高利润产品，产值达一亿六千万元，占这期间全厂总产值的百分之三十二点六。这些产品都是专治不常见疾病的药物。而对广大工农兵所急需的药物，却借口产值低，生产麻烦，无利可图，拒不生产，置工农兵身体健康于不顾。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。我们无产阶级革命派高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，把那些混进党内的走资派揪了出来，夺回了被他们篡夺的大权，批判了刘少奇和他的代理人在医疗卫生工作中推行的反革命修正主义路线。我们坚决遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，大量生产农村需要的药品。如广大贫下中农特别欢迎的“小儿安”、“眼药水”等产品，目前日产量比文化大革命前提高了近三倍，成本也大大降低。为了给“赤脚医生”提供方便条件，我们还把一些大包装药品，改为小包装，把水剂、粉剂改成片剂。为了更好地为贫下中农服务，我们还组织了以优秀老工人为主，有革命干部和技术人员参加的三结合调查组，深入农村广泛征求贫下中农和“赤脚医生”以及公社卫生院的意见，初步了解到农村常用药物的特点和贫下中农对一些药品的意见，为改进药品生产提供了依据，同时还收集了许多民间偏方、秘方，经过分析研究，制成了四种药品。
    “为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题”，也是工业企业部门两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点。我厂活生生的阶级斗争现实充分证明：这次无产阶级文化大革命是完全必要的，是非常及时的。正是由于毛主席及时发动和领导了这场无产阶级文化大革命，才保证了我们国家千秋万代永不变色。正是由于我们把党内一小撮走资派窃踞的领导权夺了回来，才能按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把制药厂办成真正的社会主义企业，更好地为广大工农兵服务。
