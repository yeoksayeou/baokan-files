To Be a Lifetime Revolutionary "Ox"

Flame of the Chemical Factory Canteen Worker Zhou Xiu Rong

Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, has nothing but "official" in his mind. He shamelessly advocated: "In the past, one could become an official by passing the imperial examination. Now, by joining the Communist Party, one can also become an official." These clear words vividly depict Liu Shaoqi's ugly face as a political speculator and expose his filthy soul of bourgeois individualism.

Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "join the party to become an official" theory is a great insult to the honorable title of a Communist Party member and a great insult to the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party. We join the party entirely for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, to liberate all mankind, and ultimately to realize the boundlessly magnificent communism.

In the smoky years of war, I joined the great Chinese Communist Party with a heart dedicated to defending Chairman Mao. Although I was young at the time, having Chairman Mao in my heart made me fearless of mountains of knives and seas of fire. The revolutionary work needed me to serve as a secret courier for the party, so I risked my life time and again to quickly transmit the party's important instructions. In my mind, there was only one thought: to defend Chairman Mao, even if it meant dying, I would do so willingly. After the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao led us in the great land reform movement. I followed Chairman Mao closely, taking the lead in fighting landlords and distributing land. The class enemies saw me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They cunningly said to me: "Xiu Rong, you are really a foolish girl. You won't get any official position, so why bother to be so serious?" When I heard such nonsense, I was so angry that my lungs almost burst. I immediately retorted to these bad guys: "You are the enemies of the people, and we must fight you to the end! You want me not to fight against you, that's just wishful thinking!" The class enemies were so frightened by my rebuke that they fled in terror, tails between their legs. From 1958 to now, I have been cooking for ten years. Comrades ask me what I think, and I firmly declare: "As long as the revolution needs it, as long as defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line needs it, I am willing to be a canteen worker for life."

For more than twenty years since I joined the party, I have always followed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "Communist Party members are not to seek official positions but to revolutionize." I have been advancing on the path of thought revolutionization. This year, during the National Day, I represented the million revolutionary workers of the Dalian Chemical Factory to come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration and saw our great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness and the greatest glory of my life. I keep the red book close to my heart, looking up at the great leader Chairman Mao, with tears of loyalty: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your brilliant thoughts that have nurtured my growth. I will definitely follow your words, be a lifetime revolutionary "old yellow cow," pull the revolutionary cart for life, and strive for communism all my life.

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's "join the party to become an official" theory is a bloodless soft knife. He attempts to use the "join the party to become an official" theory to induce us to peacefully evolve, gradually slide towards the road of seeking fame and profit, and prepare conditions for his restoration of capitalism. This is a very reactionary and evil conspiracy. We must ride the strong east wind of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee to criticize and expose the reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory!

### 当一辈子革命的“牛”

　　当一辈子革命的“牛”
　　大连化工厂炊事员  周秀荣
    刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，满脑袋都是“官”字。他毫不知耻地鼓吹说：“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官”。这几句清清楚楚的道白，就活画出刘少奇政治投机商的丑恶嘴脸，也暴露了他的资产阶级利己主义的肮脏灵魂。
    刘少奇鼓吹的“入党做官论”，是对共产党员这个光荣称号的极大污辱，也是对伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的极大的污辱。我们加入党，完全是为了中国革命和世界革命，是为了解放全人类，最终实现无限壮丽的共产主义。
    在硝烟弥漫的战争岁月里，我怀着誓死保卫毛主席的一颗红心，光荣地加入了伟大的中国共产党。当时，我的年纪虽然很轻，但因我心中有了毛主席，就刀山敢上，火海敢闯。革命工作需要我担任党的秘密交通员，我就一次又一次地冒着生命危险，迅速传递党的重要的指示。在我的头脑里，只有一个念头：为了保卫毛主席，就是死了也心甘。在全国解放以后，毛主席又领导我们进行伟大的土地改革运动。我紧跟毛主席，带头斗地主、分田地。阶级敌人把我看成眼中钉、肉中刺。他们狡猾地对我说：“秀荣，你真是个傻丫头，你又混不到一官半职，何苦来那样认真呢？”我听到这种混账话，肺都要气炸了，当即反驳这帮坏家伙说：“你们是人民的仇敌，我们就是要把你们这些坏蛋斗倒斗臭！你们要我不和你们作斗争，那是痴心妄想！”阶级敌人被我训斥得心惊肉跳，灰溜溜地夹着尾巴逃跑了。从一九五八年到现在，我做了十年饭。同志们问我有啥想法，我坚定地表示：“只要是革命需要，只要是捍卫毛主席的革命路线需要，我情愿做一辈子炊事员。”
    我入党二十多年来，一直遵循毛主席“共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的伟大教导，在思想革命化的大道上不断前进。今年国庆节，我代表大连化工厂万名革命职工，来到北京参加国庆观礼，见到了我们工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席。这是我一生中最大最大的幸福，最大最大的光荣。我把红色宝书贴在心，仰望着伟大领袖毛主席，热泪盈眶表忠心：毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的光辉思想哺育我不断成长，我一定听您老人家的话，做一辈子革命的“老黄牛”，拉一辈子革命的车，为实现共产主义奋斗终生。
    大叛徒刘少奇的“入党做官论”，是杀人不见血的软刀子。他妄图用“入党做官论”诱使我们和平演变，逐步滑向追名求利的修正主义道路，为他复辟资本主义准备条件。这是一个十分反动的罪恶阴谋，我们一定要乘党的十二中全会公报的强劲东风，把反动的“入党做官论”批倒批臭！
