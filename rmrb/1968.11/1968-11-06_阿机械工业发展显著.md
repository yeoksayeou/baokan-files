Albania's mechanical industry has seen significant development in recent years.

Several machine manufacturing enterprises, such as the tractor parts factory, nail and screw manufacturing factory, and several machine factories, have been built in recent years. In Korçë, a factory for precision instruments and machine tools is under construction. In other cities, existing machine factories are being expanded and new machine factories are being built.

Due to the continuous increase in new mechanical factories and their production, the output of the mechanical industry has greatly increased. The production volume of the mechanical industry in 1967 exceeded pre-war levels by approximately seventy-seven times. This year, the mechanical industry has seen even greater development, with the production volume for this year being twice that of 1965.

In addition to producing industrial machinery and various equipment, the newly built mechanical industry also produces daily consumer goods and various labor tools needed by the people.

    阿机械工业发展显著
    新华社地拉那四日电  据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚的机械工业在最近几年中有了显著的发展。
    一些机器制造企业如拖拉机配件厂、制钉和螺丝钉制造厂以及好几个机械厂是最近几年建成的。在科尔察，正在兴建量具和工作母机厂。在另外一些城市正在扩建现有机械厂和兴建一些新的机械工厂。
    由于新的机械工厂的不断增加并投入生产，机械工业的生产量大大增加。一九六七年的机械工业生产量超过了战前约七十七倍。今年的机械工业生产取得了更大的发展，今年机械工业的生产量相当于一九六五年的年产量两倍。
    新建的机械工业除生产发展工业用的工艺机械、各种装备以外，还生产了人民需要的日常消费品和各种劳动工具。
