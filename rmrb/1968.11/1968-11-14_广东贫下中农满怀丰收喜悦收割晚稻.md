Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Guangdong Province have overcome natural disasters and various difficulties, achieving another bumper harvest of late rice this year.

Currently, from the northern mountains of Guangdong to the foothills of the Five Finger Mountains, from the Chaozhou and Shantou plains to the fields of western Guangdong, a prosperous scene of bumper harvests is presented everywhere. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, filled with revolutionary spirit and the joy of harvest, are busy reaping the late rice. This year, the late rice in most parts of the province has increased to varying degrees. The counties in the Pearl River Delta, known as the "rice bowl of Guangdong," have achieved significant increases in production on the basis of consecutive years of increased production.

This year, during the late rice transplanting season, the lower reaches of the West River, North River, and the Pearl River Delta experienced waterlogging, seriously affecting the timely completion of transplanting work in low-lying areas; in August and September, some areas in northern Guangdong experienced severe drought; when the rice seedlings were about to head and flower, the coastal areas of Chaozhou and Shantou were hit by a strong typhoon; during the later stage of field management, pest and disease outbreaks occurred throughout the province. In addition, due to the sabotage by class enemies, the supply of production materials such as fertilizers and pesticides encountered some difficulties. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They displayed a high degree of revolutionary spirit, actively launching fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, severely striking the sabotage activities of class enemies; at the same time, they engaged in a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, finally overcoming one difficulty after another, achieving victories in both revolution and production, and winning a bumper harvest of late rice.

    广东贫下中农满怀丰收喜悦收割晚稻
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，广东省广大贫下中农和革命干部战胜了自然灾害和种种困难，今年全省晚稻又获得丰收。
    目前，从粤北山区到五指山麓，从潮汕平原到粤西田野，到处呈现一派欣欣向荣的丰收景象。广大贫下中农和革命干部满怀革命豪情和丰收的喜悦，正挥镰加紧收割晚稻。今年全省绝大部分地区的晚稻都获得不同程度的增产，素有“广东粮仓”之称的珠江三角洲各县，在连年增产的基础上，今年又有较大幅度的增产。
    今年正当晚稻插秧季节，西江、北江下游和珠江三角洲一带，渍水内涝，严重影响低洼地区插秧工作的按时进行；八九月间，粤北有些地区出现严重干旱；禾苗将要抽穗扬花时，潮汕平原等沿海地区受到强台风的侵袭；转入后期田间管理时，全省各地普遍发生病虫害。此外，由于阶级敌人的破坏，化肥、农药等生产资料的供应曾遇到了一些困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和革命干部，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们发扬高度的革命精神，一面主动向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，狠狠地打击阶级敌人的破坏活动；一面同各种自然灾害展开顽强搏斗，终于战胜了一个又一个困难，夺得了革命、生产双胜利，赢得了晚稻丰收。
