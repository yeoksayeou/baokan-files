In September, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the working class must lead everything," created a miracle that left right-wing conservatives astonished. In twenty days, they produced 350 cargo three-wheeled motorcycles, equivalent to the highest production in the factory's history, which was achieved in seven months in 1966.

The Great Transformation in Production Under the Leadership of the Working Class

The appearance of this miracle was not accidental. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised the political awareness of all the workers in the factory to an unprecedented level, fundamentally changing their spiritual outlook. They say: "Mao Zedong Thought rules in our minds, and we can take charge in the factory." The working class taking charge has brought about a series of revolutionary changes in production, which inevitably leads to a great leap in production.

Firstly, they have thrown off the set of revisionist management systems of control, inspection, and suppression. With a heartfelt loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the workers approach production with a sense of responsibility as masters of the state. The situation has changed dramatically. The workers rejected the production team's plan to produce 80 units per month and decided to produce 350 units with all their might, offering the best results as a tribute to Chairman Mao. To fulfill the tribute plan, the entire factory was united in spirit and effort. They proactively delivered materials, sought work, and created production conditions for the next shift, with everyone eager to contribute more to the battle of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Young worker Liu Zhiyi, who used to work by the piece under the influence of material incentives and always complained of being tired, now places his stopwatch next to the machine, not only counting minutes but also seconds. He reduced the auxiliary time from 15 seconds to 5 seconds, and still finding it too slow, he discovered a trick to reduce it to 2 seconds.

Secondly, they do not blindly follow technical "authorities," shattering the constraints that hinder workers' enthusiasm. The workers directly took control of technical leadership, demonstrating their wisdom and creativity in production. In the past, workers were tightly bound; even a slight change in the processing method required six levels of approval. Now that the workers are in charge, as long as a few relevant people agree that it is reasonable and beneficial, they will experiment and reform. Thus, the more effort they put in, the more methods they find. Four veteran workers, without any drawings or data, displayed a revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, creating a new process of low-pressure hard mold casting for the crankcase, solving a long-standing problem that two casting engineers had not been able to resolve. A urgently needed production die-casting machine, which the reactionary technical "authority" could not operate and did not allow workers to operate, claiming it would explode if operated incorrectly, had been idle in the workshop for eight years. Now, such ghost stories no longer frighten the workers. Through bold experiments, they finally mastered the operating techniques. Such examples can be found in every workshop and every team. In September, the entire factory implemented 90 technical innovations, with the highest efficiency increase reaching 42 times.

Thirdly, they broke down the artificial boundaries between workshops and teams, achieving great communist cooperation. In the past, according to the revisionist post-responsibility system, the tool workshop only made tools and gauges, and the machine repair workshop only repaired equipment. In the battle to complete the tribute plan, they saw that the machining workshop had a large workload, so they carried Mao Zedong's portrait high, beating drums and gongs to take on tasks and seize work. They said: "'Three Articles,' 'completely' and 'thoroughly' for the people, is our highest post-responsibility system." They "seized" 35% of the workload, and their own workshop's tasks were also completed well. When a large number of parts and components were transferred to the assembly team, there were only eight days left until the end of the month. If the assembly team only assembled according to the past pace, it might take three months, and they would only be able to complete it by the end of the year. After learning about this situation, all the workshops organized assault teams to go and help, even the cooks joined the battle. Thus, the assembly was completed in three days, with all the quality meeting the standards. The entire factory's workers attacked key points, helped with difficulties, coordinated closely, and cooperated comprehensively, greatly promoting the communist spirit.

Not only within the factory, but also between factories, it was the same. The cooperating units said: The working class is one family, your tribute plan is also our tribute plan, and if there are difficulties, we will find ways to solve them. Some of them put down their own work first and did the cooperative tasks, doing them as they arrived. Some revolutionary committee directors went deep into the teams to personally arrange cooperative tasks. Some changed from one shift to three shifts for cooperative tasks, improving the production of cargo boxes from 50 per month to completing 350 in ten days.

Breaking and Establishing, Criticizing and Reforming in the Struggle

How to reform unreasonable regulations and further promote the development of productive forces? This is a pressing issue that the motorcycle factory must address. This factory of about 900 people had more than 3,000 regulations and nearly 900,000 words in the past. Many regulations were overturned by the masses during the Cultural Revolution, but there were still many unreasonable regulations that hindered the development of production. Especially the management personnel in production, technology, finance, and supply, who were reduced from 93 to 14, felt that there were too many procedures and too few people. The workers also said that wearing new shoes but walking old paths would not work.

In this situation, some people advocated organizing a few people to draft new regulations and establish new systems. The supporting army and the factory revolutionary committee believed that this method would not work and that it was necessary to organize production leaps, fully expose contradictions, and in the struggle practice, break down the old and establish the new, criticize and reform.

After the leap plan to pay tribute to Chairman Mao was set, the workers first felt that old designs and old processes were obstacles and stumbling blocks to the production leap. A worker posted a big-character poster titled "Take Action, Criticize Old Designs and Old Processes." At the same time, an old worker had already cut off four "appendixes" in the design in his actual work. The supporting army and the factory revolutionary committee immediately held an on-site meeting, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management" and "crawling," firmly supporting the workers' revolutionary rebellious spirit. Thus, a mass movement to reform unreasonable regulations, break down old designs and old processes, and promote production efficiency by leaps and bounds, was vigorously launched. In less than 20 days, more than 40 design reforms and more than 200 process improvements were realized, and production efficiency increased by multiples.

The masses were mobilized, and the production situation was changing rapidly. What was a pile of raw materials in the morning became a batch of products in the afternoon. Telephones, reports, cooperation meetings, and dispatch meetings had long lost their effectiveness, and revisionist management methods were subjected to fierce attacks. The 20 types of reports in the tool workshop were retained by the masses with only one type. The inter-workshop cooperation tasks were unknown to the production team, but the parts had already been installed on the car. Faced with this situation, all members of the supporting army and the revolutionary committee office wore work clothes, jumped out of the administrative circle, and achieved political work on the front line, organizational command on the front line, problem-solving on the front line, and all services on the front line. The comrades in the production team, after going to the front line, did not grasp which machine had a high load or which process had many problems, as in the past, but grasped active thoughts and studied Chairman Mao's works with the masses, breaking through key points. The three offices of the revolutionary committee, except for leaving one person to handle daily affairs, all went down, and the work was done better than before. The comrades in the production team said: Only by going to the masses to achieve ideological transformation and using politics to command production can we truly simplify and streamline.

Revolution is a Powerful Motive Force for Production

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is to liberate productive forces, revolution is to promote the development of productive forces." The changes in the motorcycle factory fully prove that Chairman Mao's wise judgment is absolutely correct.

This motorcycle manufacturing plant, formed by the merger of five handicraft cooperatives, had made little progress in production and construction under the control of the capitalist roaders for seven or eight years before the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in this factory was very intense. Until early January of this year, the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions were still very serious, and production was once paralyzed.

The supporting army believed that this was the result of the instigation and sabotage by the capitalist roaders and the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. To promote production, it was necessary to grasp the revolution, grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and grasp the political and ideological work of the masses. Therefore, they concentrated for more than 20 days, with half a day of study and half a day of production for the entire factory, to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes, they spoke highly of Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness, spoke highly of Chairman Mao's leadership in the Chinese revolution, spoke highly of the profound significance of this great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, carried out mass reminiscence and sweetness activities, severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the factory who tried to restore capitalism, and fundamentally aroused the masses' class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, fundamentally raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Starting from January this year, they have always grasped the fundamentals without wavering, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and taken solid steps to quickly achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination, carrying out a series of tasks such as cleaning up class ranks and simplifying and streamlining, guiding the workers to take the road of political construction of the factory. The deeper the revolution goes, the higher the production rises.

In September, production was very tense. However, they did not relax the revolution, did not relax the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and did not relax the great criticism of the revolution, but carried it out more vigorously.

The battle in September was a great exercise, first tempering the red hearts of all the workers in the factory to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Through this battle, the thoughts of all the workers in the factory were greatly liberated, and they more firmly believed in the great power of Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and more clearly saw the new situation of industrial production that would emerge after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are now full of confidence, preparing in terms of ideology, organization, and material, to welcome a greater production leap, and to offer the best results to the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

　　毛泽东思想武装的工人能够创造奇迹
　　从北京摩托车制造厂的生产飞跃看工业生产新形势
　　（调查报告）
    九月间，北京市摩托车制造厂革命职工，在伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示的指引下，创造了使右倾保守主义者目瞪口呆的奇迹，二十天生产了三百五十部货运三轮摩托车，相当于建厂以来产量最高的一九六六年七个月的产量。
    工人阶级当家作主在生产上的巨大变化
    这个奇迹的出现，绝不是偶然的。无产阶级文化大革命使全厂职工政治觉悟空前提高，精神面貌发生了根本性的变化，他们说：“毛泽东思想在我们头脑里当家，我们就能在工厂作主。”工人阶级当家作主，在生产上发生了一系列革命变化，必然要引起生产大飞跃。
    首先是摔掉了管、卡、扣、压那一套修正主义的管理制度，工人同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，以国家主人翁的高度责任感来搞生产，形势就大不一样了。工人们否决了生产组提出的月产八十部的计划，决心鼓足最大的干劲生产三百五十部，用最好的成绩向毛主席献礼。为了完成献礼计划，全厂一个心眼一股劲。他们主动送材料，主动找活干，主动为下一班创造生产条件，人人都要在这场抓革命、促生产的战斗中向毛主席多敬献一分红心。青年工人刘志义，原来在“物质刺激”的影响下，约着分量干活，还总喊累。现在，他把马蹄表摆在机床旁，不仅算分，而且算秒，把辅助时间由十五秒减少到五秒还嫌慢，又找到个窍门减少到两秒。
    其次是不迷信技术“权威”，砸碎了束缚工人积极性的条条框框，工人同志直接掌握了技术领导权，在生产中处处显示出工人群众的智慧和创造力。过去工人被捆得死死的，改动一下加工方法就要经过六道签字画押手续，有劲也使不出来。现在工人当家作主，只要几个有关的人一合计，认为有理、有利，就试验，就改革，这样，越干劲头越大，办法越多。四个老工人在一无图纸、二无资料的情况下，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，创造出曲轴箱低压硬模浇铸的新工艺，解决了两个铸造工程师一直没有解决的“老大难”问题。一台生产上急需的压铸机，反动技术“权威”自己不会开，又不许工人开，说什么开不好要爆炸，在车间一直躺了八年。现在，那套鬼话再也吓不住工人了，经过大胆试验，他们终于掌握了操作技术。这样的例子哪个车间、哪个班组都有。九月份，全厂实现了各种技术革新九十项，提高效率最高的达到四十二倍。
    第三是打破了车间之间、班组之间人为的界限，出现了共产主义大协作。过去，按照修正主义的岗位责任制，工具车间只管做工卡量具，机修车间只管设备维修。在完成献礼计划的战斗中，他们看到加工车间任务量大，就高举毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓地去要任务，抢活干。他们说：“‘老三篇’，‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民，就是我们最高的岗位责任制。”他们“抢走”了百分之三十五的任务量，本车间的任务也完成得很好。当大批零件、部件转到装配组时，离月底只八天了，如果只靠装配组按过去进度组装，恐怕要三个月，到年底才能完成。各车间知道这个情况后，都组织突击队前去帮助，连炊事员也投入了战斗，这样，三天就组装完成了，质量全部合格。全厂职工见关键就攻，见困难就帮，紧密配合，全面协作，共产主义风格大大发扬。
    不仅厂内如此，厂与厂之间也是这样。协作单位的同志说：工人阶级是一家，你们的献礼计划也就是我们的献礼计划，有困难我们想办法。他们有的把自己的活卸下来，先干协作任务，随到随干。有的革命委员会主任深入班组，亲自安排协作任务。有的改一班为三班，为协作任务搞技术革新，由月产五十部货箱提高到十天完成三百五十部。
    在斗争实践中大破大立、大批大改
    如何改革不合理的规章制度，进一步推动生产力的发展？这是摩托车厂迫切需要解决的问题。这个九百来人的工厂，过去各种规章制度就有三千多条，九十多万字。很多规章制度在文化大革命中被群众冲掉了，但还有不少不合理的规章制度仍然束缚着生产的发展。特别是生产、技术、财务、供销等管理人员，由过去九十三人减为十四人，感到人少手续多，忙不过来。工人同志也说，穿新鞋走老路，不改不行。
    在这种情况下，有人主张应当组织几个人，起草新规章，建立新制度。支左解放军和厂革命委员会认为这种办法行不通，必须通过组织生产跃进，充分暴露矛盾，在斗争实践中大破大立，大批大改。
    当向毛主席献礼的跃进计划定下来后，工人同志首先感到旧设计、旧工艺是生产跃进的拦路虎、绊脚石。一个工人同志贴出一张题为《行动起来，大造旧设计、旧工艺的反》的大字报。同时，有个老工人已经在实际工作中割掉了四个设计上的“盲肠”。支左解放军和厂革命委员会立刻召开现场会，狠批刘少奇“专家治厂”“爬行主义”的反革命修正主义路线，坚决支持工人同志的革命造反精神。于是，一个改革不合理的规章制度，大破旧设计、旧工艺的群众运动，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。不到二十天就实现了设计上的改革四十多项，工艺上的改进二百多项，生产效率成倍地提高。
    群众发动起来了，生产形势在急剧地变化，上午还是成堆的原料，下午就变成成批的产品。电话，表报，协作会，调度会早已失去了作用，修正主义的管理方法受到了猛烈的冲击。工具车间的二十一种报表，群众只保留了一种。跨车间的协作任务，生产组还不知道，零件早已装在车上了。面对这种情况，支左解放军和革委会办事机构的全体成员都穿上了工作服，从事务圈子里跳出来，做到政治工作到第一线、组织指挥到第一线、解决问题到第一线、一切服务到第一线。生产组的同志到第一线后，不是象过去那样抓哪个机床负荷大，哪道工序问题多，而是抓活思想，和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，突破关键。革委会三个办事组，除各留一人主持日常事务外，全部下去，工作反而比过去干得又多又好。生产组的同志说：只有到群众中去实现思想革命化，用政治统帅生产，才是最实际最彻底的精兵简政。
    革命是生产的强大推动力
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展”。摩托车厂的变化充分证明了毛主席的英明论断无比正确。
    这个由五个手工业合作社合并而成的摩托车制造厂，文化大革命以前，在走资派的控制下，七、八年来在生产建设上一直进展不大。在文化大革命中，这个厂两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分激烈。直到今年一月初，两派群众对立情绪还十分严重，生产一度处于瘫痪状态。
    驻厂支左解放军认为，这是走资派的挑动和破坏，是刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的流毒造成的。要把生产促上去，必须狠抓革命，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，狠抓群众的政治思想工作。因此，集中二十多天时间，全厂半天学习，半天生产，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班上，大讲毛主席的英明伟大，大讲毛主席领导中国革命的伟大实践，大讲毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义，大搞群众性的忆苦思甜活动，大批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在本厂的代理人复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，从根本上激发广大群众忠于毛主席的阶级感情，从根本上提高广大群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    从今年一月份开始，他们始终狠抓根本不转向，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，一步一个脚印，迅速地实现了革命大联合和三结合，进行了清理阶级队伍和精兵简政等一系列的工作，引导职工走政治建厂的道路。革命深入一步，生产也就上升一层。
    九月份，生产是很紧张的。但是，他们没有放松革命，没有放松活学活用毛主席著作，没有放松革命的大批判，而是开展得更加活跃了。
    九月份的战斗，是一次大练兵，首先是锤炼了全厂职工忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心。通过这场战斗，全厂职工思想大为解放，更加坚信毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的巨大威力，更加看清了经过无产阶级文化大革命，工业生产将要出现的飞跃发展的新形势。他们正满怀信心地从思想上、组织上、物质上进行准备，迎接更大的生产跃进高潮，用最优异的成绩向党的第九次全国代表大会献礼。
