One night, in the depths of the night, a torrential downpour began, with raindrops pounding against the windows like popping beans. Livestock keeper Jiao Huai-rong was awakened by the rain and suddenly thought: The pigsty is cold and damp, will the newly born piglets freeze to death? At that moment, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in his ears: "Comrade White's selfless dedication and spirit of putting others before oneself are manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." He could no longer lie still, jumped out of bed, put on his clothes, grabbed a bundle of dry firewood, and headed towards the pigsty.

As soon as he opened the door, a gust of wind and rain rushed towards him, causing him to take a step back. He quickly looked up and saw a glowing red banner with Chairman Mao's words: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them." Chairman Mao's teachings were a great inspiration and motivation for him. Jiao Huai-rong felt his face burning with shame, thinking: Just now, taking a step back shows that my thoughts are not firm. If on the battlefield, taking a step back would mean losing ground; if in the struggle between the two lines, taking a step back would mean deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. No matter how great the wind and rain, even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, we revolutionary soldiers must only bravely advance and never retreat half a step. With this in mind, he pulled open the door and rushed into the wind and rain.

Not far from the door, a figure flashed by. Upon closer inspection, it was the cook, Lei Hai-lin, also carrying a bundle of dry firewood. Jiao Huai-rong understood and quickly said, "Comrade Lei, you've been working on the stove until midnight, go back and rest, I'll go alone!" Through the wind and rain, the cook's warm voice came, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our responsibility is to the people.' You've been busy all day, and you've also stood guard for half the night, you go back and rest, I'll go." The two pushed each other, neither willing to go back and rest, and finally walked towards the pigsty together.

Unexpectedly, the pigsty already had a pile of red fire burning, the firelight illuminating a smiling face. He was holding a piglet by the fire, warming them one by one. This pile of red fire warmed the hearts of Jiao Huai-rong and the cook. The two simultaneously called out softly, "Supply officer..."

In the vast night rain, three piles of red fire burned brightly in the pen, growing more and more intense. This red fire reflected the revolutionary soldiers' great sense of public duty; it tempered three hearts that were red-hot with loyalty to Chairman Mao.

　　三堆红火
    一天深夜，下起了瓢泼大雨，雨点象炒豆一样敲打着窗户。饲养员焦怀荣被雨声惊醒，猛然想起：猪圈里又冷又潮，新生下来的小猪会不会被冻死？这时，毛主席的教导在他的耳边响起：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”他再也躺不住了，跳下床来，披上衣服，抱上一捆干柴就向猪圈走去。
    刚一出门，一阵大风卷着雨点向他扑来，他不由得后退了一步。猛抬头，看到一条红光闪闪的毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的教导，对他是巨大的激励和鞭策，焦怀荣不由得感到脸上火辣辣地，心想：自己刚才后退一步，说明自己思想上还不过硬。如果在战场上，后退一步就会丧失阵地；如果在两条路线斗争中，后退一步就会背离毛主席的革命路线。我们革命战士不管遇到多大风雨，就是天塌地裂，也只有勇敢前进，决不能后退半步。想到这里，他猛地拉开门冲进风雨中。
    出门不远，前面闪过一个身影，仔细一看，原来是炊事班长雷海林，怀里也抱着一捆干柴。焦怀荣明白了，连忙说：“班长，你晚上改灶改到十二点钟，回去睡吧，我一个人去！”风雨中传来班长亲切的声音：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们的责任，是向人民负责。’你白天忙一天了，前半夜还站了一班岗，你回去休息，还是我去吧！”两个人互相推让着，谁也不肯回去休息，终于一起向猪圈走去。
    没想到，猪圈里早已燃起了一堆红火，火光映红了一个人的笑脸，他正抱着小猪守在火堆旁，给小猪轮流取暖。这一堆红火，烧暖了焦怀荣和班长的心窝，俩人不约而同地轻声喊出：“司务长……”
    茫茫夜雨中，圈棚里燃起了三堆红火，越烧越旺。这红火反映了革命战士心中高大的“公”字；锤炼着三颗忠于毛主席的火热的红心。
