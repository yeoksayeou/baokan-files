A heroic unit of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region is active on the Tibetan plateau, closely linked with the Tibetan serfs who have risen up. They enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the great situation of the Cultural Revolution to the Tibetan serfs, treat their illnesses, and rescue them from disasters, earning deep love from the broad Tibetan people.

	Bringing Chairman Mao's Voice to Every Tent

	Since the Cultural Revolution, this unit has sent out countless Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, crossing snow-capped mountains and rushing through rapid streams, entering villages and pastoral areas to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the Tibetans.

	Among them, one propaganda team consisted of ten soldiers, including motorcyclists, drivers, cooks, medics, telephone operators, radio operators, and barbers. One day, they held high portraits of Chairman Mao, carried red flags, and used horses to carry musical instruments, luggage, tents, and food, climbing over one mountain after another, and arrived at Xiecun Valley in the Himalayas. This place has nine herder households, totaling fifty-four people, living in six points several dozen kilometers apart, with the most having three households and the least having only one. The propaganda team performed dances such as "Herder Receives the Treasure Book" and "Red Guards on the Grassland Meet Chairman Mao" at each residential point. The Tibetan herders applauded and cheered enthusiastically during the soldiers' performance. After the performance, the soldiers took out their shaving tools to give the herders haircuts and propagated the great situation of the Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them, distributing portraits of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao badges, and Tibetan versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The herders excitedly said, "Thank you, Golden Flowers (soldiers) for bringing Chairman Mao's voice to our tents!"

	Because the herders' residential points are highly dispersed, each performance had no more than eight or nine spectators. The propaganda team ran from one point to another, active for several days, almost covering every tent. Finally, they learned that there was a woman named Zongba who had not seen the performance due to illness. The propaganda team then sent out seven people, crossing two mountains and walking half a day, to find Zongba's tent. Her husband and son had both gone to herd, leaving only her in the tent.

	"Zongba, Chairman Mao has sent us! We heard you are ill, so we came to see you especially," the propaganda team members said enthusiastically as they opened the tent door. The medic immediately examined her.

	Zongba was deeply moved and quickly got up to pour each person a bowl of butter tea. The propaganda team members explained the significance of the Cultural Revolution, the current great situation, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to her, then gave her family three Chairman Mao badges and a Tibetan version of the "Three Constantly Read Articles." She held them to her chest and raised them above her head, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

	The propaganda team then performed in the tent for her. Although there was only one spectator, the soldiers performed very seriously. Zongba kept saying, "Yagu du (good)!" "Yagu xishaduo (very good)!"

	Medical Personnel Who Serve the People Completely and Thoroughly

	The medical personnel of this unit, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, with deep proletarian feelings, treat the illnesses of the Tibetan people.

	Once, Gacun's Chamujiaoma suddenly fainted. Military doctor Li Huanzhang immediately rushed to the village with two medics and found that Chamujiaoma's throat was blocked by phlegm, making it difficult for her to breathe, and her life was in danger. Li Huanzhang thought that to save the patient, he must first suck out the phlegm from her throat. But he didn't bring a suction device. What to do? At this moment, Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessness" and "putting others first" echoed in his ears, and the heroic images of Wang Jie and Liu Yingjun, who fear neither hardship nor death and sacrifice themselves for others, flashed before his eyes. He resolutely took off the tube of the stethoscope, put one end in the patient's mouth and the other end in his own mouth, and sucked hard. But the tube was too small to suck out the thick phlegm. He then threw away the tube and sucked mouth-to-mouth with the patient, finally sucking out the phlegm. Chamujiaoma was saved. The onlookers were moved to tears by Li Huanzhang's sublime spirit and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

	When the Lives and Property of the Tibetans Are Threatened

	One night, the military club was brightly lit, and the soldiers were celebrating the victory of the Cultural Revolution. Suddenly, an urgent whistle sounded, and the performance immediately stopped. The soldiers rushed out of the club to assemble urgently. An officer said to everyone, "Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the only purpose of this army.' Just now, the irrigation canal near the station was washed away by a mountain torrent, and the Tibetans' crops and houses were flooded, the situation is very urgent. We will immediately set out and use the actual actions of flood control and rescue to defend the victory achievements of the Cultural Revolution."

	The soldiers, carrying shovels and sacks, boarded trucks, and rushed to Caigongtang Village in the rain. In the dark night, they saw that Caigongtang Village was flooded everywhere. After the various small teams divided their tasks, they immediately joined the battle. The Tibetans standing in the deep water saw the marching soldiers and excitedly shouted, "Chairman Mao has sent the Golden Flowers!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

	The soldiers bravely fought against the flood. The entire flood control section was filled with singing and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations. They worked with the Tibetans in waist-deep water, using branches and stones to block the breaches, and threw sack after sack filled with stones and soil at the breaches. They fought like this until dawn before they blocked the breaches. At the same time, another small team also dredged a drainage channel.

	After dawn, the soldiers built another levee behind the levee, then filled the space between the two levees with soil and stones, connecting the two levees into a large levee twelve meters long, eight meters wide, and about three meters high. The flood receded, and the Tibetans' houses and crops were saved. The Tibetans expressed their gratitude to the Golden Flowers in countless words; they sang countless songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛主席派来的“金珠玛米”和藏胞心连心
    人民解放军西藏军区的一支英雄部队，活跃在西藏高原上，和藏族翻身农牧民亲如鱼水。他们满腔热情地向藏族翻身农牧民宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，为藏胞治疗疾病，抢险救灾，受到了广大藏族同胞的深深爱戴。
    把毛主席的声音传遍每个帐篷
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，这支部队派出了无数支毛泽东思想宣传队，翻过一座座雪山，趟过一条条急流，深入农村和牧区，热情地向藏胞宣传毛泽东思想。
    其中有一支宣传队是由摩托员、汽车司机、炊事员、卫生员、电话员、报务员、理发员等十个战士组成的。一天，他们高擎着毛主席像，扛着红旗，用马驮着乐器、行李、帐篷和食品，爬过一座又一座的高山，来到了喜马拉雅山区的谢村沟。这个地方有九户牧民，共五十四人，分居在相距几十公里的六个点里，每个点最多的三户，最少的只有一户。宣传队到各个居民点给牧民们演出了舞蹈《牧民喜得宝书》《草原上的红卫兵见到了毛主席》等节目。藏族牧民在战士们演出过程中不时发出一阵阵热烈的掌声和欢呼声。演出结束后，战士们就拿出随身带来的理发工具为牧民们理发，又向牧民们宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势和毛主席的最新指示，赠送毛主席像、毛主席像章和藏文版的《毛主席语录》。牧民们兴奋地说：“谢谢金珠玛米（解放军）把毛主席的声音送到我们帐篷里来了！”
    由于牧民居住点高度分散，每次的观众最多不过八九个人。宣传队从这个点跑到那个点，活动了好几天，几乎所有的帐篷都跑遍了。最后，打听到还有一个叫宗巴的妇女因病没看到演出。宣传队便派出七个人，翻过两座大山，走了大半天，找到了宗巴的帐篷。她的丈夫和儿子都放牧去了，帐篷里只有她一个人。
    “宗巴，毛主席派我们来了！听说你病了，我们特意来看看你。”宣传队的同志一拉开帐篷门，便热情洋溢地说。一起来的卫生员马上给她看了病。
    宗巴感动万分，连忙爬起来，给每人倒了一碗酥油茶。宣传队的同志把无产阶级文化大革命的意义、当前的大好形势以及毛主席的一系列最新指示，向她作了讲解，然后送给她家三枚毛主席像章和一本藏文版的“老三篇”。她双手接过来贴在胸口，举过头顶，高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    宣传队又在帐篷里为她演出。虽然只有一个观众，战士们还是演得十分认真。宗巴连连说：“雅古堵（好啊）！雅古稀渣多（好得很啊）！”
    完全彻底为人民服务的医务人员
    这支部队的医务人员遵照毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，为藏胞们诊治疾病。
    一次，嘎村查木角阿妈突然昏倒在地。军医李焕章知道后，马上和两名卫生员跑到村里，发现查木角阿妈咽喉里的痰堵住气管，呼吸很困难，生命十分危险。李焕章想，要使病人脱险，首先要抽吸出她咽喉里的痰。可是没有带吸痰器，怎么办？这时，毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”“关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导响在他的耳旁，王杰、刘英俊一不怕苦，二不怕死，舍己为人的英雄形象闪现在他的眼前。他毅然取下听诊器的皮管，一头放在病人口里，一头含在自己口里，使劲地吸起来。可是皮管口太小，吸不出浓痰来。他就扔掉皮管，同病人嘴对嘴使劲地吸，终于把痰吸了出来。查木角阿妈脱险了。在场的群众为李焕章这种崇高的精神感动得流下了热泪，不约而同地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    当藏胞的生命财产受到威胁的时候
    一天晚上，军人俱乐部里灯光辉煌，战士们正在欢庆无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。忽然，响起了急促的哨音，演出立即停止了。战士们纷纷跑到俱乐部外面去紧急集合。一位干部对大家说：“我们伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：‘紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。’刚才，驻地附近的蔡公堂水渠被山洪冲垮了，藏胞的庄稼和房屋都被淹了，情况很紧急。我们立即出发，用抗洪抢险的实际行动来保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。”
    战士们带着铁锨、麻袋，乘着汽车，冒雨来到了蔡公堂村。黑夜里，只见蔡公堂村到处是水。各个小分队作了分工后，立即投入战斗。站在大水中的藏胞看见浩浩荡荡的解放军开来了，激动得连声高呼：“毛主席派来了金珠玛米！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    战士们英勇地同洪水搏斗着。整个抗洪地段，歌声、背诵毛主席语录声响成一片。他们和藏胞一起，在齐腰深的水流里，奋力用树枝、石头堵塞决口，还把一个个装满石头和泥土的麻袋接连往决口处抛。就这样，一直战斗到天亮，才把决口堵住。在这同时，另一个小分队也把一个排水渠道疏通了。
    天亮后，战士们在堤的后面又筑起了一道堤，然后在两堤之间用土和石头填平，把两道堤连成了一道长十二米、宽八米、高约三米的大堤。洪水退却了，藏胞的房屋、庄稼得救了。藏胞们千言万语，感谢金珠玛米；千歌万曲，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席！
