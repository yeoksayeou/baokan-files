Before enlisting in the army, I was an elementary school teacher. The school I worked at was originally a private school, but later it was converted into a public school. During the few years I worked as a private school teacher, I taught in my own village and received work points from the production brigade. I lived at home, ate the same food as the poor and lower-middle peasants, and wore the same coarse cloth clothes. During the day, I taught at school, and in the evenings, besides office work, I would return to the production brigade to study Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, help the members prepare performances, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. After school, I also made time to work in the fields. On weekends and holidays, I would lead the students to work in the fields with the poor and lower-middle peasants all day. Since I lived, ate, studied, and sweated with the poor and lower-middle peasants, our hearts were close. They said, "Xianzhong is both a teacher and a brigade member, and also a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. He is truly a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We can trust him with our children."

I had been a private school teacher for less than three and a half years when the county education bureau changed my status to a public school teacher. I went from earning work points to receiving a state salary, from eating brigade rations to eating state rations, and from living at home to moving into the school. The environment changed, the conditions changed, and my thoughts gradually changed as well. I was no longer as eager to work as before. On weekends and holidays, instead of working in the fields, I would either play at school or visit relatives. In the evenings, instead of returning to the brigade to study with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I would either check homework or play chess at school. I started wearing cloth uniforms instead of coarse cloth clothes, the calluses on my hands began to fade, and I rarely smelled of sweat. My thoughts and feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants gradually faded. In this way, an invisible gap formed between me and the poor and lower-middle peasants. When they saw me, they were no longer as friendly and warm as before. Some even angrily said, "Since Xianzhong became a public school teacher, he has become lazy, unwilling to move, always looking up, and only thinking about making money. He is no longer on the same path as us poor and lower-middle peasants."

From this, I deeply felt that whether to support or oppose converting public elementary schools into brigade-run schools is a major issue for a rural elementary school teacher. It is about whether one is willing to accept the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants and whether one is willing to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. My previous experiences as both a private and a public school teacher fully illustrate the significant differences between the two. Elementary school teachers can only become teachers welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants if they accept the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learn from them, maintain close ties with the people, avoid special treatment in their lives, and frequently participate in production labor. Only then can they fundamentally change their bourgeois worldview and cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    当民办教师和公办教师的不同感受
    入伍前，我是一个小学教师。我所在的小学，原来是民办，后来改为公办。我当民办教师的那几年，在本村教学，队里记工分。住在家里，和贫下中农吃一样的饭，穿一样的粗布衣。白天在学校里教学，晚上除了办公外，就回到生产队里和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，帮助社员排演节目，宣传毛泽东思想。放学后，我也抓紧时间下地干活。一到星期天和假期，就领着学生整天和贫下中农一起下地劳动。由于我和贫下中农住在一起，吃在一起，学习在一起，汗流在一起，心也贴在一起，贫下中农都拿我当作自己人。他们说：“献忠这孩子既是教员，又是社员，还是毛泽东思想宣传员，真是咱贫下中农的好后代。把孩子交给他，咱们也放心。”
    我当了不到三年半民办教师，县文教局就把我从民办教师改为公办教师，我就从挣工分变成拿国家工资，从吃队里的粮变成吃国库粮，住的地方也从家里搬到学校里。环境变了，条件变了，我的思想也慢慢地变了。劳动也不象以前那样经常、积极了。星期天和假期不是在学校里玩耍，就是走亲访友。晚上在学校里看看作业，下下象棋，很少再回到队里和贫下中农一起学习。粗布衣服也开始换成了料子制服，手上的茧子开始退了，身上也很少闻到汗臭味了，头脑中贫下中农的思想感情也渐渐地淡薄了。就这样，我和贫下中农之间无形中产生了一条鸿沟。贫下中农见了我，也不象以前那样和和气气亲亲热热了，甚至生气地说：“献忠这孩子自从民办转成公办后，游手好闲，不爱动弹，眼睛向上，光想挣钱，和咱贫下中农走的不是一条路了。”
    由此我深深感到：赞成不赞成将公办小学改为大队办的意见，对一个农村小学教师来说，是愿不愿意接受贫下中农领导和愿不愿意走与工农相结合的道路的大问题。我以前走过的民办和公办教师两种不同的道路，就完全说明了两者有很大区别。小学教师只有在贫下中农的领导下，虚心向贫下中农学习，密切联系群众，生活上不特殊化，经常参加生产劳动，才能成为广大贫下中农所欢迎的教师，才能从根本上改变自己的资产阶级世界观，才能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
