In the village of Tianwei in Longshan Production Brigade of Laozhuang People's Commune, Guzhen County, Anhui Province, every morning, dozens of young cowherds can be seen carrying red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and singing "The East Is Red" as they lead their cows out of the village. A young man with the appearance of a farmer, carrying a small blackboard, walks among the cowherds. Upon reaching the pasture, the young man sets up the small blackboard on the grass and begins to teach the cowherds the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" word by word. In the evening, the young man and the cowherds return to the village, singing revolutionary songs and leading their well-fed cows back.

This is a new type of school established by the poor and lower-middle peasants of six production teams in Tianwei Village—the Shepherd School. The young man is named Tian Liba, and he is the teacher of this school.

This Shepherd School has no fixed classrooms, no decent desks or teaching aids, and no formal teaching system like regular schools. However, under the direct management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, this school has solved the problem of education for over a hundred children of poor and lower-middle peasants who herd cows for the production teams. Forty students have already graduated from this school. These graduates are now working for the production teams, some keeping accounts and recording work points, while others have been selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants as active promoters of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. The poor and lower-middle peasants love this school dearly and affectionately call it "Our Shepherd School."

Tianwei Village is a rice-growing area with many draft animals. The cows of the production teams are all herded by the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1964, the village established a primary school for agricultural and reading, and most of the school-age children of poor and lower-middle peasants were able to attend. However, the education of over fifty children who herded cows for the production teams remained unresolved. That autumn, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this village held a special meeting to discuss this issue. At the meeting, they recounted the bitterness of illiteracy in the old society and proposed to establish their own school. Tianwei Production Team leader Tian Bingyin said, "We have suffered enough from illiteracy in the old society! We must not let our children become illiterate just because they herd cows. This is a matter of our children seizing power and taking over the reins. We must ensure that they both herd cows and study!" After full discussion, everyone unanimously decided to establish a mobile school that follows the cowherds for teaching. They selected Tian Liba, a poor peasant's son who had attended two years of middle school, to be the teacher, and elected Women's Brigade leader and brigade party branch secretary Tian Xianglan to be the principal. They also decided that the brigade leaders of the six production teams, six representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, and Tian Xianglan and Tian Liba would form the school management committee. Thus, the Shepherd School was established in November 1964.

The Shepherd School was established, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed, but the class enemies were terrified and hated it. They maliciously cursed the school, and the district's capitalist roaders did not even recognize it as a school. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly believed that their Shepherd School was in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. They remained steadfast and bravely fought against the class enemies, resolutely continuing to run the Shepherd School. To strengthen teacher Tian Liba's resolve and confidence in running the school, they studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" with him, encouraging Tian Liba to stand firm, resolutely resist the class enemies' attacks, and not be blown over by their malicious words. They overcame various difficulties, wholeheartedly cultivating the next generation for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

With the red sun rising in their hearts, they fear no difficulties. Under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Tian Liba became even more dedicated to teaching. To make it convenient for the students to both herd cows and study, he divided the cowherds into six study groups based on their production teams, allocated the pastures, and taught at six different locations every day. During teaching, except for the students who took turns watching the cows, the rest of the cowherds listened attentively to the lessons. During busy farming seasons when cows needed to be used and herded separately, Tian Liba walked twenty miles a day, visiting ten or more teaching points to ensure that the cowherds' studies were not interrupted. On rainy days, Tian Liba organized the children to use raincoats and straw raincoats to set up small shelters, continuing the lessons under the shelter. He also led the students to participate in collective production labor, engaging in work-study to reduce the economic burden on the students' families.

The poor and lower-middle peasants saw all this and were delighted, becoming more proactive in helping the Shepherd School. When the school lacked notebooks, they made them from old account books and sent them over; during the winter and spring seasons when outdoor herding was not needed, they vacated rooms, set up mud desks, and used them as classrooms for the school.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, the Shepherd School was run even better. This school used "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as its basic textbooks, focusing on class struggle, actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously carrying out the "Three Loyalty" activities. They conducted revolutionary criticism on the pastures and held meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Each teaching point on the pastures presented a vibrant revolutionary scene.

Chairman Mao's great teaching on "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—poor and lower-middle peasants" reached Tianwei Village, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely excited and inspired. They said excitedly, "Chairman Mao's words have touched our hearts! We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, firmly grasp the educational power in our hands, and run the Shepherd School even better!"

　　“我们的牧童学校”
    在安徽省枞阳县老庄公社龙山大队田圩村，每天一清早，可以看到几十个放牛娃，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱着《东方红》，赶着牛儿走出村庄。有个农民模样的青年，背着小黑板，走在放牛娃的中间。到了牧场，青年就在草地上撑起小黑板，向围坐在身旁的放牛娃一字一句地教起《毛主席语录》来。傍晚，那位青年又和放牛娃一起，兴高采烈地唱着革命歌曲，赶着一条条吃得腰满肚圆的牛儿走回村庄。
    这就是田圩村六个生产队贫下中农创办的一所新型学校——牧童学校。那个青年叫田立保，是这所学校的教师。
    这所牧童学校没有固定的校舍，没有象样的课桌和教具，没有所谓正规学校的那套教学制度。但是，在贫下中农的直接管理下，这所学校解决了为生产队放牛的一百多名贫下中农子女的上学问题，并且已经有四十名学生在这所学校里先后毕业。这些毕业生现在有的在给生产队记账、记工，有的还被贫下中农选为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。贫下中农非常热爱这所学校，亲切地称它为“我们的牧童学校”。
    田圩村是水稻区，耕牛多，生产队的牛都由贫下中农子女来放牧。一九六四年，村里办起了耕读小学，大部分贫下中农的学龄儿童都能上学了，可是，五十多名给生产队放牛的儿童的上学问题还没法解决。这一年秋后，这个村的贫下中农专门开会研究了这个问题。在会上，他们诉了旧社会没有文化的苦，提出要自己办学。田圩生产队队长田炳银说：“旧社会没有文化的苦我们吃够了！我们决不能让孩子们因为放牛就当文盲，这是关系到我们的子女掌权接班的大事，一定得让他们又放牛又念书！”大家经过充分讨论，一致决定办一所跟着放牛娃流动教学的牧童学校，并且挑选上过两年中学的贫农儿子田立保当教师，推举妇女大队长、大队团支部书记田香兰当校长。大家还决定由六个生产队的队长、六名贫下中农代表和田香兰、田立保组成学校管理委员会。就这样，牧童学校在一九六四年十一月份办起来了。
    牧童学校办起来了，贫下中农喜气洋洋，阶级敌人却怕得要命，恨得要死，他们恶毒地咒骂这所学校，区里走资派也压根儿不把它当个学校看待。贫下中农坚信自己办的牧童学校符合毛主席的教导，他们毫不动摇，勇敢地同阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，坚持把牧童学校办下去。为了坚定教师田立保办学的决心和信心，他们还和他一起学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，鼓励田立保站稳脚跟，坚决顶住阶级敌人的进攻，千万别让那些恶言冷语吹倒，克服各种困难，一心一意为贫下中农培养下一代。
    心中升起红太阳，千难万险无阻挡。田立保在贫下中农的教育下，更加热心教学。为了使学生放牧、学习两方便，他把放牛娃按生产队编为六个学习组，划分了牧区，每天跑六个地点巡回教学。教学时，除了轮流照看牛的学生外，其余的牧童都安心听课。农忙时牛要分散使用和放牧，田立保就一天走一二十里路，跑十几个教学点，保证放牛娃学习不中断。下雨天，田立保组织孩子用斗笠、蓑衣搭成小棚，就在棚里照常教学。他还领着学生参加集体生产劳动，搞勤工俭学，减轻学生家长的经济负担。
    这些，贫下中农都看在眼里，喜在心里，越来越积极主动地帮助牧童学校。学校缺少本子，他们就用旧账本订本子送去；冬春季节不需要野外放牧，他们就腾出房子，搭了泥课桌，给学校当教室。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，牧童学校办得更好了。这个学校以《毛主席语录》和毛主席的一系列最新指示为基本教材，以阶级斗争为主课，活学活用毛泽东思想，大力开展“三忠于”活动，在放牧场上进行革命大批判，举行活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会。各个牧场的教学点都出现了一派朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的伟大教导传到田圩村，贫下中农无比欢欣鼓舞。他们激动地说，毛主席的话说到我们心坎里去了！我们一定不辜负毛主席的期望，坚决把教育大权牢牢掌握在我们手里，把牧童学校办得更好！
