The people's war led by our great leader Chairman Mao is the longest, most complex, and richest in experience of any proletarian-led armed struggle in the world today. Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is a highly systematic and comprehensive summary of the experience of China's revolutionary armed struggle, a brilliant and great development of Marxism-Leninism, and a powerful ideological weapon for all oppressed peoples and nations to wage armed struggle and achieve thorough liberation.

The revolutionary model operas cultivated by our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing vividly and prominently propagate Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war, vividly and vividly displaying the glorious scenes of people's war in various revolutionary periods in our country.

The Red Detachment of Women galloping across Hainan Island, the Eighth Route Army soldiers active on the North China Plain, the New Fourth Army fighters battling by Lake Yangcheng, the pursuit teams of the PLA speeding through the forests and snowfields, and the spearhead platoon of the Volunteer Army charging into the lairs of the Americans and the Li... The bugles blare, the iron horses gallop, the war drums roar, and the red flags flutter. We recall the fiery days of the Second Revolutionary Civil War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we are brought into the tumultuous battlefields of the War of Liberation and the Korean War.

The revolutionary model operas, shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, are a magnificent canvas of the surging people's war, a magnificent song of the people's war echoing through the clouds, and an epic of the brilliant people's war.

The Revolutionary Army

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords by the force of the gun," "the whole world can only be transformed by the gun." This is the highest and most profound summary made by our great leader Chairman Mao based on the experience of class struggle in human society, especially the experience of the people's war in China, using the most colloquial and vivid language. It is a universal truth applicable everywhere.

The revolutionary model operas such as "The Red Detachment of Women," "Sha Jianhu," "The White-Haired Girl," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" fully embody Mao's brilliant thoughts on seizing political power through the gun and solving problems through war. Liberating the coconut grove, overthrowing Nan Badi, retaking Sha Jianhu, marching south of the Yangtze River, strategically taking Tiger Mountain, and consolidating Mudanjiang... all were achieved through the use of guns. The revolutionary people, relying on the gun, have overthrown one enemy after another; relying on the gun, they have liberated vast rural and urban areas from the Northeast to Jiangnan, from North China to Hainan; relying on the gun, they have seized power and established proletarian political power.

From Khrushchev in the Soviet Union to Liu Shaoqi in China, all traitors of the people's war have viciously slandered and opposed the revolutionary people's war. They use literature and art to vilify revolutionary wars, propagate the horror of war, and attempt to disarm the revolutionary people spiritually, urging oppressed nations and peoples to lay down their guns and submit to the slaughter by the fully armed American imperialism and its running dogs. Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing stands up and fights back. In the revolutionary model operas, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "emphasize the role of armed struggle and stress the use of armed revolution to eliminate armed counter-revolutionaries," she uses the strongest revolutionary voice to passionately sing the praises of the revolutionary people's war, playing the victory march of the revolutionary gun, drowning out the counter-revolutionary clamor of the traitors of the people's war, and sounding the war drums of the era to smash the old world through armed struggle!

"Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people." The main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution is war, and the main organizational form is the army under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. This army is fundamentally different from all old armies; it is a new type of people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary model operas, with unbounded proletarian revolutionary passion, sing the praises of such a new type of people's army. With Hong Changqing, Guo Jian'guang, Yang Zirong, and Yang Weicai as representatives, the people's army is a force that serves the people wholeheartedly. They "want to smash the thousand-year-old iron chains and open the fountain of happiness for a thousand generations," they "carry the hopes of the people and want to plant the red flag all over the country," they think of "how many people in the world suffer, class hatred, national enmity, and the American imperialists who do not share the same sky." When they enter the dragon's den, they "possess an unyielding spirit, they want to overcome all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy"; when they fight in the enemy's rear, "no matter how difficult and hard the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight"; when they fight to the death, "they are determined, fearless of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory"; on the battlefield shrouded in smoke, they not only have the courage to overcome all enemies but also the ability to control the entire war's changes and developments.

Comrade Lin Biao teaches us: "What is the best weapon? It is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. What is the greatest combat effectiveness? The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." The revolutionary model operas prominently reflect a fundamental principle in Mao's people's war thought: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." They deeply reveal that the people's army can be invincible and unstoppable, relying on proletarian politics, relying on the revolutionary consciousness and bravery of the proletariat, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," the pursuit team of the PLA, with high proletarian consciousness and fearless bravery, faces the Tiger Mountain, which is fortified with clear fortresses and hidden tunnels, and the bandit leader Zuo Daotai, who relies on this terrain that can attack, defend, and escape. They unanimously proposed the plan of "strategic capture." It is precisely because Yang Zirong has the spirit of "willing to shed hot blood to write the spring and autumn annals" that he dares to enter the tiger's den alone; he can seize the opportunity at the critical moment to send out decisive military intelligence; he can, in the face of the sudden arrival of Luan Ping at the Tiger Hall, remain calm and wise, and with great courage, overwhelm the enemy. This bravery and fearlessness, and revolutionary wisdom, come from his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people. "Facing the severe cold and turning ice and snow into sunshine in my heart," Yang Zirong has the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, so he is both wise and courageous, able to overcome a nest of extremely stubborn enemies in the "forest of swords and thorns." Similarly, in "Sha Jianhu," the eighteen wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army, and in "The Battle of the White Tiger Regiment," the spearhead platoon of the Volunteer Army, because they are all soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, everyone has the spirit of bravery and fearlessness, so they can "not be blown down by an 8,000-mile storm or blown down by 9,000 thunderbolts," they can be "all courage and high morale," they can "drive away tigers and wolves and become stronger in battle."

Yang Zirong, Guo Jian'guang, Yang Weicai, and a series of heroic figures shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought are the true representatives of those proletarian hard bones who "can fight without fear of hardship or death, can charge forward when ordered to charge, can hold the line when ordered to defend. One person can be equal to several, several dozen, several hundred people, and any human miracle can be created." They collectively represent the essence of the people's army and fully reflect the great role of the people's army in the people's war.

While describing such a new type of people's army and creating such soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary model operas also vividly reflect Mao's strategies and tactics for people's war. Entering Tiger Mountain and "strategically capturing" it, launching a "surprise attack" on the White Tiger Regiment, are the best examples. In "The Battle of the White Tiger Regiment," a spearhead platoon of our Volunteer Army disguised as the enemy, captured a "tongue," obtained the password, and with lightning speed, directly penetrated the enemy's heart, smashing the "White Tiger Regiment" command to smithereens, and cooperating with our main forces, defeating the enemy thoroughly, making them fall like flowers and leaves, disoriented. Such strategies and tactics of people's war can only be fully utilized by those armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The seemingly powerful, well-armed iron tiger, in the face of such strategies and tactics of people's war, is completely transformed into a genuine paper tiger. In "The Battle of the White Tiger Regiment," the modern landmines and other things that the American imperialists rely on become, under the feet of revolutionary soldiers with the spirit of bravery and fearlessness, useless pieces of scrap metal in an instant. From the heroic figure of Yang Weicai, standing tall and firm like Mount Tai, we see the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought and the complete bankruptcy of "weapon worship" and the "philosophy of survival"!

The revolutionary model operas most vividly, most vividly, and most profoundly show this truth: soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, guns led by Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible and unmatched.

The Revolutionary Masses

With passionate and surging brushstrokes, the revolutionary model operas depict the great role of the laboring masses under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in the people's war.

From the Mudanjiang in the white mountains and black waters to the Five-Finger Mountain at the end of the earth, from the banks of the Yangtze River to the villages under the Five-Tiger Mountain, across the country for tens of thousands of miles, mountains and plains are ablaze with the high hatred of the laboring people against imperialism and domestic class enemies. The unyielding Sha Nainai, the brave and strong Li Yongqi, the lively Xia Changbao, the successive generations of the people of Hainan... under the enemy's fire, they charge with the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the PLA, bravely fighting the enemy; in the face of the enemy's butcher's knife, they are unyielding and fearless of death; in the rear, they are self-reliant and enthusiastic in supporting the front; in the mountains and villages, they form a net to annihilate the enemy. The revolutionary model operas' depiction of the masses fully demonstrates our great leader Chairman Mao's fundamental thought on the people's war theory: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can the war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can the war be waged."

Daring to mobilize and lead the masses to wage revolutionary war against imperialism and its running dogs is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized, organized, and armed the masses in the course of the Chinese revolution, leading the people of the whole country to wage a protracted and arduous revolutionary war, and composing an epic of the people's war. Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, in her outstanding artistic practice of revolutionary model operas, not only vividly depicts the magnificent scenes of the people's war but also deeply and vividly reveals the class nature of the people's war.

Through the vivid and specific depictions in the revolutionary model operas, we can see that in the old society, the oppressed and exploited laboring masses harbor immense revolutionary power. Under the Five-Finger Mountain, there are countless Wu Qinghuas who do not endure the oppression and trampling of the reactionary forces; along the banks of the Yangtze River, there are countless Sha Nainais, Qilongs, and Wang Fugens who harbor deep hatred for the Japanese bandits, traitors, and Kuomintang bandits; on the North China plains, there are countless Xi'er and Yang Bailaos who fight to the death with the feudal landlords; in the deep mountains and old forests of Northeast China, there are countless Li Yongqis and Xia Changbaos who are ready at any time to annihilate the bandits raised by the Kuomintang. In deep suffering, they "ride the storm, carry thunder and lightning," and "transform into a storm, transform into thunder, and shake the heavens." Through the profound depiction of many scenes of mass struggle, the revolutionary model operas fully demonstrate the deep and solid mass foundation of the revolutionary war.

What is the driving force for mobilizing the masses to wage revolutionary war? The revolutionary model operas vividly answer this question: it is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Once Mao Zedong Thought is combined with the broad laboring masses, it will form a powerful force for revolutionary war.

In "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," the hunter Chang and Xia Changbao are tormented by Zuo Daotai to the point of family destruction for three generations. They have endured eight years of blood and tears, "waiting for the stars and the moon, only waiting for the sun to rise in the mountains." At this moment, the PLA, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, arrives. The PLA, represented by Yang Zirong, awakens the class consciousness of the masses, tells the masses the principles of revolution, and tells the masses that "all oppressed people in the world have a book of blood and tears," and that laboring people must take up arms and follow the savior Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to unite and revolt. They bring Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, making Chang the hunter and Xia Changbao not only know that the PLA is their army but also understand that they themselves are the masters who smash the old world and create a "beautiful day that lasts for a thousand years." Xia Changbao, who has been forced to be a mute child for eight years, opens her mouth in front of her relatives: she tells her experiences, pours out her bitterness, and decides to follow the PLA to "grow wings, hold a gun, fly to the mountains, and kill all the wolves!" Similarly, when Mao Zedong Thought spreads to the suffering Jiajiugou, Li Yongqi, driven to desperation, utters a resounding oath representing the voice of the broad laboring masses: "From now on, I will follow the Communist Party to drive away the tigers and wolves, whether it is walking in water or walking through fire, I will be willing to die!" In "The Red Detachment of Women," the Red Army brings Mao Zedong Thought to the foot of the Five-Finger Mountain, and Wu Qinghua, who has suffered countless hardships and is unyielding, strides forward and joins the ranks of the Red Army, launching a tumultuous revolutionary struggle with the Red Army, making countless Wu Qinghuas see the light; in "The White-Haired Girl," the Eighth Route Army brings Mao Zedong Thought to Yanggezhuang, saving Xi'er, who has been struggling with hardship for several years, and Xi'er also shoulders the red banner to join the Eighth Route Army. The class hatred of the laboring people in Yanggezhuang, "forming a vast sea of waves," immediately turns into a great revolutionary force. The revolutionary model operas vividly and prominently tell people: Mao Zedong Thought not only saves countless laboring people but also guides the broad laboring people from naive class hatred to the great revolutionary struggle to liberate all mankind. The great victory scenes of the people's war, such as "meeting at the banquet of a hundred chickens," "annihilating," "repaying a thousand years of hatred," and "attacking the coconut grove," not only show that the laboring people armed with Mao Zedong Thought powerfully cooperate with the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the PLA, leveling Tiger Mountain, taking the coconut grove, overthrowing Huang Shiren, and annihilating the Japanese bandits and traitors, but also demonstrate the magnificent revolutionary atmosphere: the awakened laboring people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, will surely be able to smash the old world to pieces. These revolutionary model operas, with profound artistic power, prove: once the oppressed and exploited laboring people are combined with Mao Zedong Thought, they will launch a revolutionary mass war and create a new world where "red flags are planted everywhere" and "light shines on the world."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the people." The revolutionary model operas, with vivid and convincing artistic images, powerfully prove: no matter how large or small the battlefield, no matter how large or small the villages and towns, as long as the broad laboring masses are fully mobilized, they can put any strong and ferocious enemy into a net of heaven and earth. The small Sha Jianhu, after being "swept" by the Japanese bandits for three days, was again invaded by the "loyal and righteous army" colluding with the "Japanese, Kuomintang, and Wang" bandits. This bandit force, after entering the village, was arrogant and invincible. However, the people of Sha Jianhu are the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They are fearless of heaven and earth, and they fight wit, courage, strategy, and tactics with the enemy, fully demonstrating the fighting power of the masses. This makes Hu Chuanhui and Diao Deyi become deaf and blind, falling into a maze. Sha Jianhu has no New Fourth Army, and they do not know where the wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army are hidden. They are suspicious of everything, restless, and until they are annihilated by the people in cooperation with the New Fourth Army by the banks of Lake Yangcheng, they still do not know the directions.

Through these vivid descriptions, the revolutionary model operas fully demonstrate the great power of the people's war and eloquently explain that every victory in the revolutionary war is achieved by relying on the broad masses; in the face of the iron wall of tens of millions of laboring people who have stood up, those who were once arrogant, such as the Japanese bandits, traitors, Kuomintang, Zuo Daotai, Nan Badi, Huang Shiren, and the once arrogant American imperialism, are all like wild cows rushing into a fire, and they will all be burned to a crisp by the revolutionary fire of the laboring people!

The Revolutionary Base Areas

The revolutionary model operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Sha Jianhu," and "The Red Lantern" reflect, from various different aspects and to different degrees, Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on surrounding the cities from the countryside, establishing rural base areas, and finally seizing the cities.

Chairman Mao, based on the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, pointed out the importance of establishing rural revolutionary base areas: "Because the powerful imperialists and their reactionary allies in China have long occupied the central cities of China, if the revolutionary forces do not want to compromise with the imperialists and their running dogs but want to persist in the struggle, if the revolutionary forces want to prepare to accumulate and temper their strength and avoid decisive battles with powerful enemies when their strength is not sufficient, then they must turn the backward countryside into an advanced and solid base area, a great revolutionary stronghold in military, political, economic, and cultural terms, to counter the vicious enemies who use cities to attack rural areas, and to gradually achieve complete victory in the revolutionary struggle."

"The pursuit team shoulders the heavy burden for the people, and the support line is as firm as iron." The pursuit team led by Xiao Jianbo and Yang Zirong is carrying out the great strategic task of "establishing a solid base area in Northeast China." At that time, the situation on the Northeast battlefield was that the enemy was strong and we were weak, the enemy was numerous and we were few, and our army was facing the Kuomintang in front and bandits behind. If the bandits were not eliminated, a solid revolutionary base area could not be established. Zuo Daotai in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a bandit who has been entrenched in the forests and snowfields. The scene "mobilizing the masses" vividly depicts the scene of our army's pursuit team establishing a revolutionary base area in Jiajiugou. After the pursuit team entered Jiajiugou, they fully mobilized the masses, organized the militia, built railways... "The army and the people are heart to heart, and the joyous scene fills the village. The snow falls, and people laugh, sharing clothes and food to celebrate liberation." The four lines of singing by Li Yongqi's mother truly depict the new appearance of Jiajiugou, the newly established revolutionary base area. The pursuit team's entry into Jiajiugou was "to level Tiger Mountain." Jiajiugou becoming a revolutionary base area created the premise for strategically taking Tiger Mountain; leveling Tiger Mountain, in turn, consolidated the base area of Jiajiugou.

In those days, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, brilliantly implemented Chairman Mao's great strategic decision, turning countless Jiajiugous into one revolutionary base area after another, and liberated all of Northeast China in nearly three years. The entire Northeast, as a revolutionary base area, made a great contribution to the liberation of the whole country.

In "Sha Jianhu," the New Fourth Army, led by Guo Jian'guang, with eighteen wounded soldiers, retreated to Sha Jianhu. After the "sweep" led by the Japanese bandits, the bandits wearing Kuomintang insignia and eating Japanese rations, led by Hu Chuanhui, occupied Sha Jianhu. They used every means to search for the wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army. However, the eighteen wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army, led by Guo Jian'guang, with the support and assistance of the local party, and under the cover of thousands of people who genuinely support the revolution, successfully held out in the reed marsh, just a water away from the enemy, where the sound of chickens and dogs can be heard. Later, they directly charged into Sha Jianhu, capturing the Japanese bandit Kurosawa and the bandits Hu Chuanhui and Diao Deyi alive. In the process of the eighteen wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army turning from passive to active, Sha Jianhu, which temporarily became an enemy-occupied area, showed its great power. From this ups and downs of the plot, one deeply understands this truth: "What is the base area of guerrilla warfare? It is the strategic base for guerrilla warfare to carry out its strategic tasks, achieve the purpose of preserving and developing itself, and annihilating and driving away the enemy."

In "The Red Lantern," the towering hero and outstanding representative of the working class, Li Yuhe, as an underground worker of our party, "holds a red lantern and looks around," waiting for "people from North Manchuria to come to Longtan," always working for the North Mountain guerrilla forces to open the way. Until the moment before his martyrdom, he still remembered to instruct Tie Mei to "settle the account and have no worries." The Japanese bandit Yama, threatening and tempting Li Yuhe, torturing him severely, wanted the code. The enemy's self-incriminating confession revealed the enemy's inner anxiety: "... If this code falls into the hands of a guerrilla force with several thousand people, it would be like a tiger growing wings!" The fatal threat to the enemy is the North Mountain guerrilla forces. "The Red Lantern" explains the relationship between armed struggle and urban work, reflecting the importance of revolutionary base areas from the side.

The revolutionary base areas are the rear of the revolutionary war, the base of surrounding the cities from the countryside, and they play an important role in the people's war.

The revolutionary model operas cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing passionately sing the praises of the revolutionary army, the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary base areas, successfully reflecting the brilliant facts of the people's war in China under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This success sets a brilliant example for the arts to express Chairman Mao's thoughts on the people's war and opens up a broad road for revolutionary war literature.

Long live the victory of the people's war!

　　人民战争的宏伟画卷
　　——赞革命样板戏
　　海军直属机关　红文　学青
    我们伟大统帅毛主席所领导的中国革命武装斗争，是当今世界上无产阶级领导的时间最长久、斗争最复杂、经验最丰富的人民战争。毛主席关于人民战争的理论，是中国革命武装斗争经验的高度的系统的总结和概括，是马克思列宁主义的天才的伟大的发展，是一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族进行武装斗争，求得彻底解放的强大的思想武器。
    敬爱的江青同志亲手培育的革命样板戏，鲜明地、突出地宣传了毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想，形象地、生动地展现了我国各个革命时期的人民战争的辉煌图景。
    驰骋于海南岛的红色娘子军连，活跃在华北平原的八路军子弟兵，战斗在阳澄湖畔的新四军指战员，飞驰在林海雪原的解放军追剿队，直插入美李巢穴的志愿军尖刀班……，军号嘹亮，铁骑飞奔，战鼓隆隆，红旗飘飘，让我们回忆起如火如荼的第二次国内革命战争和抗日战争，把我们带进了轰轰烈烈的解放战争和抗美援朝的战场。
    闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命样板戏，是人民战争波澜壮阔的绚丽画卷，是人民战争响彻云霄的壮丽颂歌，是人民战争光辉灿烂的宏伟史诗。
    革命的军队
    “枪杆子里面出政权”，“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主”，“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席根据人类社会阶级斗争的经验，特别是中国人民战争的经验，用最通俗、最鲜明的语言所作的最高度、最精辟的概括，它是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
    《红色娘子军》、《沙家浜》、《白毛女》、《智取威虎山》等革命样板戏，以深刻丰富的革命内容，真实动人的艺术形象，充分地体现了毛主席这一用枪杆子夺取政权，用战争解决问题的光辉思想。解放椰林寨、打倒南霸天，收复沙家浜、进军大江南，智取威虎山、巩固牡丹江……都是靠的枪杆子。革命的人民，正是依靠枪杆子，把万恶的阶级敌人和民族敌人，一个个打翻在地；正是依靠枪杆子，从东北到江南，从华北到海南，解放了广大的农村和城市；正是依靠枪杆子，夺得了印把子，建立了无产阶级的政权。
    从苏联的赫鲁晓夫到中国的赫鲁晓夫刘少奇，一切人民战争的叛徒们，无不恶毒地诋毁和反对革命的人民战争。他们利用文学艺术来丑化革命战争，宣扬战争的恐怖，妄图解除革命人民的精神武装，要被压迫民族和被压迫人民放下枪杆子，在全副武装的美帝国主义及其走狗面前听任宰割。我们敬爱的江青同志挺身而出，针锋相对，在革命样板戏中，遵照毛主席“突出武装斗争的作用，强调武装的革命消灭武装的反革命”的指示，用震撼世界的革命最强音，热情地歌颂了革命的人民战争，奏出了革命枪杆子的胜利进行曲，淹没了人民战争叛徒们的反革命叫嚣，擂响了用武装斗争彻底粉碎旧世界的时代战鼓！
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”中国革命主要的斗争形式是战争，主要的组织形式是在中国共产党绝对领导下的军队。这支军队根本区别于一切旧军队，而是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的新型的人民军队。
    革命样板戏以奔放的无产阶级的革命豪情，歌颂了这样一支新型的人民军队。以洪常青、郭建光、杨子荣、杨伟才为代表的人民子弟兵，是一支全心全意为人民服务的军队。他们“一心要砸碎千年铁锁链，为人民开出万代幸福泉”，他们“肩负着人民的希望，要把红旗插遍祖国四方”，他们心想着“全世界有多少人民受苦难，阶级仇，民族恨与美帝不共戴天。”他们在深入龙潭虎穴的时候，“具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”；他们在敌后坚持斗争的日子里，“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”；他们在出生入死的战斗中，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”；他们在硝烟弥漫的战场上，不但有压倒一切敌人的勇气，而且有驾驭整个战争变化发展的能力。
    林副主席教导我们：“什么是最好的武器？不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。什么是最大的战斗力？最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”革命样板戏突出地体现了毛主席人民战争思想中一个根本的原理，即“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”；深刻地揭示了人民的军队所以能够战无不胜，攻无不克，靠的是无产阶级政治，靠的是无产阶级的革命觉悟和勇敢精神，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    《智取威虎山》中有着高度的无产阶级觉悟和勇敢不怕死的精神的解放军追剿队，面对着明碉堡暗地道处处设防、层层屏障的威虎山，面对着仗着这个能攻能守又能溜的地形的顽匪头子座山雕，不约而同地提出了“智取”的计划。杨子荣正是有着“甘洒热血写春秋”的献身精神，才敢于单枪匹马深入虎穴；才能在关键时刻将计就计，送出了有决定意义的军事情报；才能在栾平突然来到威虎厅的情况下，沉着机智，以大无畏的英雄气概压倒敌人。他这种勇敢不怕死的精神和革命的智慧，来自对毛主席、对党、对人民的无限忠诚。“抗严寒化冰雪我胸有朝阳”，杨子荣心中有着最红最红的红太阳毛主席，有着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，他就智勇双全，能在“刀丛剑树”的匪窟之中，战胜一窝凶顽透顶的敌人。同样，《沙家浜》中的十八个新四军伤病员，《奇袭白虎团》中的志愿军尖刀班，正因为他们个个是毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，人人都有勇敢不怕死的精神，所以他们就能“八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰”，他们就能“浑身是胆斗志昂”，“驱虎豹杀豺狼愈战愈强。”
    杨子荣、郭建光、杨伟才等一系列闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的英雄形象，就是那种“打起仗来不怕苦，不怕死，要冲就冲得上，要守就守得住。一个人顶几个人、几十个人、几百个人用，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来”的无产阶级硬骨头的真实典型。他们集中表现了人民军队的本质，充分体现了人民军队在人民战争中的伟大作用。
    革命样板戏在描写这样一支新型的人民军队，塑造这样一些用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士形象的同时，也生动地体现了毛主席人民战争的战略战术。入威虎山而“智取”，对白虎团作“奇袭”，就是最好的例证。在《奇袭白虎团》中，我志愿军一个尖刀班巧扮敌军，抓“舌头”，套口令，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，直插敌人心脏，把“白虎团”指挥机关砸了个稀巴烂，并配合我大军把敌人打得落花流水，晕头转向。这种人民战争的战略战术，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人才能充分运用。貌似强大、武装到牙齿的铁老虎，在这种人民战争的战略战术面前，就彻底转化为地地道道的纸老虎。《奇袭白虎团》中美帝国主义所依靠的那些现代化地雷之类的东西，在有着勇敢不怕死精神的革命战士脚下，转眼就变成了一块一块无用的废铁。我们从杨伟才高如泰山挺然矗立的英雄形象中，看到了毛泽东思想的无比威力，看到了“唯武器论”和“活命哲学”的彻底破产！
    革命样板戏最生动、最形象、最深刻地显示了这样一个真理：毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，毛泽东思想统帅的枪杆子，战无不胜，所向无敌。
    革命的群众
    革命样板戏以豪情激宕的笔墨，描写了毛主席、共产党领导下的劳动群众在人民战争中的伟大作用。
    从白山黑水的牡丹江，到天涯海角的五指山，从长江侧畔的阳澄湖，到五台山下的农村，纵横国土几万里，漫山遍野燃烧着劳动人民对帝国主义和国内阶级敌人的高度的仇恨烈火。傲如青松的沙奶奶，英勇刚强的李勇奇，生龙活虎的小常宝，前赴后继的海南人民……，在敌人的炮火下，同红军、八路军、新四军、解放军一道冲锋陷阵，奋勇杀敌；在敌人的屠刀前，威武不屈，视死如归；在后方，自力更生，踊跃支前；在山川村镇密布罗网，歼灭敌人。革命样板戏对劳动群众的这种描写，充分地展示了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于人民战争理论的根本思想：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    敢不敢放手发动群众、领导群众对帝国主义及其走狗进行革命战争，是区别马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的分水岭。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席和以毛泽东思想为指针的中国共产党，在中国革命的历程中，发动群众、组织群众、武装群众，领导全国人民群众进行了艰苦卓绝的革命战争，谱写了人民战争的光辉史诗。我们敬爱的江青同志在革命样板戏的卓越艺术实践中，不仅气势磅礴地描绘出了人民战争的雄伟图景，而且为人们深刻地、形象地揭示出人民战争的鲜明的阶级性。
    透过革命样板戏生动具体的描写，我们可以看到，旧社会里受压迫受剥削的劳动群众中蕴藏着巨大的革命力量。在五指山下，有千千万万个吴清华不甘忍受反动势力的欺凌、践踏；在长江两岸，有千千万万个沙奶奶、七龙、王福根对日本强盗、汉奸、国民党匪帮怀着深仇大恨；在华北原野，有千千万万个喜儿、杨白劳同封建恶霸地主进行生死的搏斗；在东北的深山老林，有千千万万个李勇奇、小常宝随时准备把国民党所豢养的土匪消灭干净……。他们在深重的苦难里“乘狂风，挟雷电”，“化作风暴、化作霹雳震九霄”。革命样板戏通过许多群众斗争场面的深刻描写，充分地展现了革命战争的深厚、坚实的群众基础。
    动员群众进行革命战争的动力是什么呢？革命样板戏形象地回答了这个问题：是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想一经和广大劳动群众相结合，就会形成强大的革命战争的力量。
  《智取威虎山》里的常猎户和小常宝，被座山雕迫害得祖孙三代家破人亡。他们饮忍了八年的血泪仇恨，“盼星星盼月亮，只盼着深山出太阳”。就在这样的时刻，由毛泽东思想武装起来的解放军来到了。以杨子荣为代表的解放军启发群众的阶级觉悟，给群众讲述革命的道理，告诉群众“普天下被压迫的人民都有一本血泪账”，劳动群众要翻身做主人就要拿起武器跟着救星毛主席、共产党齐心合力闹革命。他们把毛泽东思想送到了群众中间，使常猎户、小常宝不仅知道解放军是自己的队伍，而且懂得了自己就是打烂旧世界、创造“美好的日子万年长”的主人。被迫装了八年哑童的小常宝在亲人面前开口了：她讲遭遇，吐苦水，决心跟随解放军“生翅膀、持猎枪、飞上山岗、杀尽豺狼！”同样，当毛泽东思想传播到苦难的夹皮沟之后，被逼得铤而走险的李勇奇说出了代表广大劳动群众心声的响亮誓言：“从此我跟定共产党把虎狼撵，不管是水里走，火里钻，粉身碎骨也心甘！”《红色娘子军》中的工农红军把毛泽东思想送到了五指山下，受尽磨难、坚强不屈的吴清华便挺胸阔步地走进红军的行列，同红军一起掀起轰轰烈烈的革命斗争，使千万个吴清华见到了阳光；《白毛女》中的八路军把毛泽东思想送到杨各庄，救出了同苦难搏斗了几年的喜儿，喜儿也扛起红缨枪参加了八路军，杨各庄劳动群众的“汇成波浪滔天的江海”的阶级仇恨，立即变成了巨大的革命力量。革命样板戏鲜明地、突出地告诉人们：毛泽东思想不但拯救了千千万万的劳动群众，而且把广大劳动群众由朴素的阶级仇恨引导到解放全人类的伟大革命斗争中去。“会师百鸡宴”、“聚歼”、“千年的仇要报”、“攻打椰林寨”等人民战争的伟大胜利场面，不仅表现出用毛泽东思想武装起来的劳动群众，有力地配合红军、八路军、新四军、解放军，削平了威虎山、拿下了椰林寨、打倒了黄世仁、聚歼了日寇和汉奸，而且展示出了气势磅礴的革命意境：觉醒了的劳动群众在毛主席、共产党的领导下，必定能够把整个旧世界打个落花流水。这些革命样板戏，以深厚的艺术力量证明：受压迫受剥削的劳动群众一旦同毛泽东思想相结合，就会爆发革命的群众战争，打出一个“红旗插遍”、“光照人间”的新世界来。
    毛主席教导我们：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”革命样板戏以生动感人的艺术形象，富有说服力地证明：战场无论大小，村镇无论大小，只要广大劳动群众充分发动起来，就能把任何强大、凶恶的敌人置于天罗地网之中。小小的沙家浜，经过了日寇三天“扫荡”之后，又闯进了“日、蒋、汪”相勾结的“忠义救国军”，这支土匪部队进村后，凶焰万丈，不可一世。但是，沙家浜的群众是毛泽东思想武装起来的群众。他们天不怕、地不怕，他们和敌人斗智、斗勇、斗计、斗谋，充分发挥了群众的战斗威力。这就使胡传葵、刁德一变得耳聋、眼瞎，陷入了迷魂阵。沙家浜有没有新四军他们搞不清，新四军的伤病员隐蔽在什么地方他们更搞不清。他们草木皆兵，神魂不定，直到被群众配合新四军把他们消灭在阳澄湖畔，他们还没有分清东南西北。
    革命样板戏通过这些绘声绘色的描写，充分显示了人民战争的巨大威力，雄辩地说明，革命战争的每一个胜利，都是紧紧依靠了广大群众才取得的；在数万万站起来的劳动群众的铜墙铁壁面前，那些外强中干的日寇、汉奸、蒋介石、座山雕、南霸天、黄世仁……，以及嚣张一时的美帝国主义，统统不过是闯入火阵的野牛，它们终将被劳动群众的革命烈火烧得皮焦肉烂！
      革命的根据地
    《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《红灯记》等革命样板戏，从各个不同的侧面，在不同的程度上体现了毛主席的以农村包围城市，建立农村根据地，最后夺取城市的光辉思想。
    毛主席根据中国革命的特点，在指出建立农村革命根据地的重要性时说：“因为强大的帝国主义及其在中国的反动同盟军，总是长期地占据着中国的中心城市，如果革命的队伍不愿意和帝国主义及其走狗妥协，而要坚持地奋斗下去，如果革命的队伍要准备积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，并避免在力量不够的时候和强大的敌人作决定胜负的战斗，那就必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”
    “追剿队为人民肩负重担，支前线安后方志如铁坚。”以少剑波、杨子荣为首的追剿队，就是执行着具有伟大战略意义的“建立巩固的东北根据地”的战斗任务。当时，东北战场上的形势是敌强我弱，敌众我寡，我军前面是国民党，背后是土匪。如果不清除土匪，就不能建立巩固的革命根据地。《智取威虎山》中的座山雕就是盘踞在林海雪原的惯匪。“发动群众”这场戏，生动地描绘了我军追剿队在夹皮沟建立革命根据地的情景。追剿队进入夹皮沟以后，就放手发动群众，组织民兵，修筑铁路……。“军民一家心连心，欢腾景象满山村。瑞雪纷飞人欢笑，分衣分粮庆翻身。”李勇奇母亲的这四句唱词，真实地勾画了夹皮沟这个新建的革命根据地的新面貌。追剿队进驻夹皮沟，“为的是扫平威虎山”。夹皮沟成为革命根据地，就为智取威虎山创造了前提；扫平威虎山，又反转来巩固了夹皮沟这个根据地。
    当年，我们敬爱的林副统帅，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，出色地实现了毛主席的伟大战略决策，把无数个夹皮沟建立成一片又一片的革命根据地，仅用将近三年的时间就解放了全东北。整个东北作为革命根据地，又为全国解放做出了巨大的贡献。
    《沙家浜》中以郭建光为首的新四军十八名伤病员，负伤转移来到沙家浜。在以日寇为先导的扫荡之后，戴着国民党帽徽，吃着日寇粮饷的胡传葵匪帮又进占了沙家浜。他们千方百计地搜捕新四军的伤病员。但以郭建光为首的十八名新四军伤病员，在地方党的支持协助下，在千百个“真心实意地拥护革命的群众”的掩护下，就在与敌一水之隔、鸡犬之声相闻的芦苇荡中，胜利地坚持下来。后来，又飞兵直插沙家浜，生俘日寇黑田，活捉胡传葵、刁德一。在新四军十八名伤病员由被动转为主动的过程中，沙家浜这个暂时成为敌占区的根据地，显示了它的强大威力。从这个起伏跌宕的剧情发展中，令人深思地领悟到这样一个真理：“游击战争的根据地是什么呢？它是游击战争赖以执行自己的战略任务，达到保存和发展自己、消灭和驱逐敌人之目的的战略基地。”
    《红灯记》中顶天立地的英雄、工人阶级的优秀代表李玉和，作为我党的地下工作者，“手提红灯四下看”，等待着“北满派人到龙潭”，时刻都在为北山游击队开辟道路。直到牺牲前夕，他仍念念不忘嘱咐铁梅“还清账目我无挂牵”。日寇鸠山对李玉和威胁利诱，严刑拷打，要的是密电码。敌人色厉内荏的自白，供出了敌人的内心忧患：“……如果这份密电码落到拥有几千人的游击队手里，那就如同老虎长了翅膀”！对敌人致命的威胁是北山游击队。《红灯记》阐明了武装斗争和城市工作两者之间的主从关系，从侧面反映了革命根据地的重要性。
    革命的根据地，是进行革命战争的后方，是农村包围城市的基地，它在人民战争中有着重要的地位。
    江青同志亲手培育的革命样板戏，热情洋溢地歌颂了革命的军队、革命的群众和革命的根据地，成功地反映了在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下的中国人民战争的光辉史实。这个成功，为文艺表现毛主席的人民战争思想树立了光辉的典范，为革命战争文学开拓出广阔的道路。
    人民战争胜利万岁！
