This issue can be discussed.

The cadres of the Revolutionary Committee of Dongzaolin Brigade, Weishanzhuang People's Commune, Daxing County, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and primary school teachers have enthusiastically discussed the editorial note of November 14 in the People's Daily and the suggestions made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu.

Everyone agrees that the suggestions are very good, representing the inner aspirations of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary primary school teachers, and are the necessary path to implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools." They express their resolute support.

However, a few people think that if teachers are given work points, it may lead to a lack of enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause. The main reason is: commune members can collect firewood after work, but teachers have to correct homework, prepare lessons, and do ideological work for students after class. Household chores also need attention. Now, with a salary, they can buy whatever they need with money, but if they get work points, they will have to wait for distribution. This may cause teachers to be unwilling to focus on teaching. Therefore, in order to make teachers work well, in addition to work points, some appropriate allowances can be given.

How should this issue be understood and correctly resolved? We hope it can be discussed by everyone.

### 这个问题可以讨论

　　这个问题可以讨论
    大兴县卫善庄公社东枣林大队革委会负责人、贫下中农代表、小学教师热烈讨论了十一月十四日《人民日报》编者按和侯振民、王庆余两同志的建议。
    大家都认为这个建议好得很，代表了贫下中农、革命小学教师的内心愿望，是落实毛主席“贫下中农管理学校”指示的必由之路，表示坚决支持。
    但有少数人认为，教师记工分，就会产生对革命事业心不强的现象。主要理由是：社员下工可以拾柴禾，老师下课却要改作业，备课，做学生的思想工作，家务事不管也不行。现在拿工资，要什么就用钱买，以后记工分就只等分配了，这很可能引起教师不安心教学。因此，为了使教师很好地工作，除了记工分外，可以适当地给一些补助。
    这个问题，应当怎样认识，正确解决，希望引起大家讨论。
