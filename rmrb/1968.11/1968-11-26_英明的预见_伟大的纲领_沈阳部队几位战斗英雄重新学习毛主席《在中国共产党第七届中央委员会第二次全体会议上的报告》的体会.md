Heroes of the People's Liberation Army of China's Shenyang Military Region, including national war heroes Zhao Xingyuan, Zha Shunyi, Mao Guo, and Chang Enju, studied the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party while simultaneously revisiting Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. In the past, they had heard the spirit of this important report during the intense battles; later, they had the honor of directly listening to Chairman Mao's great teachings at the National Conference of War Heroes in 1950. Now, after nineteen years of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, especially after two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have revisited this brilliant historical document and found it particularly meaningful. They unanimously agreed that this brilliant document has great historical and contemporary significance. Studying this document is of great importance for implementing the tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, deeply understanding the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, further grasping Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminating the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roadier Liu Shaoqi, raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

**Be Vigilant Against "Enemies Without Guns"**

National war hero and brigade commander Zhao Xingyuan said:

On the eve of our nationwide victory, Chairman Mao used Marxism-Leninism to scientifically and deeply analyze the classes, class contradictions, and class struggles after the victory, pointing out that the fundamental contradiction would be between the working class and the bourgeoisie. He especially warned us: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." The facts of class struggle over the past nineteen years have fully proven Chairman Mao's wise foresight.

During the war years, we mainly fought against enemies with guns, and our awareness of the enemy was strong, and our revolutionary vigilance was high. After the victory, our vigilance against "enemies without guns" was not as high as against those with guns, and our awareness of the enemy was weaker than during the war. Why did this happen? I have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind, especially during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have deeply examined my soul, discovering that deep within my thoughts there was a "fixed fate" idea, mistakenly believing that individuals have a "fixed fate," and so does the revolution. With this viewpoint, it is inevitable to lack class struggle awareness, not seeing the class enemies, first of all, not seeing the "enemies" in one's own mind, and even less seeing the class enemies hiding within our ranks who "wave the red flag to oppose the red flag." Therefore, when Chairman Mao issued the warning to "especially be vigilant against revisionism in the central leadership," I did not understand it.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have received profound education, realizing that the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is to overthrow the "enemies without guns." These "enemies without guns" are not just those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed; the main ones are those who have usurped important leadership positions in the Party and the state and are agents of the bourgeoisie. Liu Shaoqi is their representative. In the history of our Party, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by Liu Shaoqi have fought sharply at every important moment and on every major issue. Those with the "fixed fate" idea can never recognize or distinguish the new situation and characteristics of the struggle between the two classes and two lines under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Not only that, but they may also be poisoned by these "enemies without guns" without knowing it, so that their heads are cut off without knowing how it happened!

I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. In the past, under the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, we defeated the enemies with guns using the gun barrel; in the future, I will definitely follow the instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao, learn to fight against the "enemies without guns." The "enemies without guns" are not as easy to expose as those with guns, but I firmly believe that as long as we grasp the political telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought, all "enemies without guns," no matter how cunning they are or how cleverly they disguise themselves, will not escape destruction.

**Firmly Defend the Life of the Proletariat**

National war hero and deputy regiment commander Mao Guo said:

In his important report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the issue of "establishing the government" and "maintaining the government," and clearly pointed out: "The state power of the People's Republic led by the working class must be strengthened, not weakened, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings ultimately remind us: seizing power is not easy, and maintaining power is even harder.

"The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." The facts of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines over the past nineteen years fully illustrate: the road after the revolution is long in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, great in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and arduous in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The nineteen years after national victory were nineteen years of struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries without guns; they were nineteen years of the people and soldiers of the nation defending the proletarian government and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our "support-left" Shulan Coal Mine has long been controlled by a small clique of capitalist-roaders who followed the instructions of their black master Liu Shaoqi, recruiting traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and usurping the leadership of the mine. Under their control, they promoted "money as the commander" and "material incentives," almost pushing a socialist enterprise established after national victory into the capitalist quagmire. Just at this time, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the broad revolutionary workers rose up to rebel against the small clique of capitalist-roaders in the mine, seizing their power and establishing a revolutionary committee of three-in-one composition, completely changing the face of the entire mine. The revolutionary workers excitedly said: "If we don't carry out the Cultural Revolution, the Party and the country will perish. Fortunately, Chairman Mao initiated this Cultural Revolution in time, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preserving our proletarian mountains and rivers!"

The workers' heartfelt words speak to the great significance of consolidating the proletarian government. The government is the survival right and life of the proletariat. With the government, the proletariat has everything; without the government, the proletariat loses everything.

I am a military representative in the revolutionary three-in-one committee. The military's position in the state power is extremely important and is a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's dispatch of military representatives to participate in the revolutionary three-in-one committee is a great strategic measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and a wise decision to defend the survival rights and life of the proletariat. I am determined to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions with my actions, firmly complete the glorious tasks assigned by Chairman Mao, and in the revolutionary three-in-one power organ, take the lead in carrying out the thought revolutionization, playing the role of the pillar of the People's Liberation Army, and together with the revolutionary cadre representatives and revolutionary mass representatives, firmly grasp power for the proletariat and use power for the proletariat.

**Implement the Dictatorship of the Proletariat in the Superstructure**

National war hero and deputy political commissar of the political department Chang Enju said:

Great leader Chairman Mao instructed us in the report to the Seventh Central Committee's Second Plenary Session: "We must learn to fight against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in cities in political, economic, and cultural struggles." In the past, my understanding of the "cultural struggle" pointed out by Chairman Mao was insufficient. I always thought: Chairman Mao liberated me from the sea of suffering and gave me the gun barrel. I only need to hold the gun in my hand, follow Chairman Mao to make a revolution, and go wherever Chairman Mao points. As for the cultural struggle, that is the business of those who wield the pen, and we soldiers do not need to worry about that. Looking back now, we workers, peasants, and soldiers only grasp the gun barrel, the hammer handle, and the hoe handle, but do not grasp the pen, which is indeed a big problem.

Since national victory, a small clique of capitalist-roaders led by Liu Shaoqi, in order to restore capitalism, have vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of literature and education, turning our schools, stages, newspapers, and magazines into breeding grounds for revisionism, attempting to seize power by first seizing people and seizing people by first seizing their souls. The facts of class struggle have made me deeply realize that Chairman Mao wants us to learn to carry out cultural struggles, which is to launch an attack on the class enemies in the superstructure and seize the cultural power from the bourgeoisie, implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including all cultural fields.

Without seizing the cultural power, it is difficult to defend the political power, and the root of suffering cannot be eliminated. Today, the working class armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, following the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, has taken the stage of political struggle in various fields of the superstructure in a grand manner, implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure. This is an unprecedented earth-shaking event in the history of the world. We revolutionary soldiers vow to be the strong backbone of the working class, firmly support the working class leading everything, and firmly support the working class implementing comprehensive proletarian dictatorship in all fields of the superstructure. We must grasp the pen while holding the gun, firmly defend the cultural power of the proletariat, and play our due role in the cultural struggle.

**Thoroughly Smash the Attack of Sugar-Coated Bullets**

National war hero, active learner, and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, and deputy political commissar of the rear service department of the Shenyang Military Region Zha Shunyi said:

Great leader Chairman Mao warned us as early as nineteen years ago that after the national victory, the situation of class struggle has undergone new changes, and we must especially be vigilant against the attack of sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. Over the past decade, there have been such people in the revolutionary ranks who were once revolutionary but have become agents of the bourgeoisie within our Party under the attack of sugar-coated bullets. The enemy's sugar bullets are often more harmful than steel bullets. When steel bullets cannot maintain the enemy's reactionary rule, they use sugar bullets to corrupt the weak-willed in our ranks.

"Comrades must continue to maintain the style of being humble, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient, and must continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." This is the great call for continuing the revolution issued by the great leader Chairman Mao on the eve of national victory to the entire Party and the army. The practice over the past decade, especially the practice of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, has made me deeply realize that to continue the revolution after the national victory and follow Chairman Mao, one must first consciously overthrow oneself, being both a force for the revolution and an object of the revolution.

Since the victory, due to the needs of the situation's development, the Party and the people have given me higher positions, more honors, and better living conditions, and my age has also increased. I have noticed that: higher positions can easily produce "official" airs; more honors can easily produce "arrogant" airs; better living conditions can easily produce "spoiled" airs; and older age can easily produce "twilight" airs. In such a situation, if one does not consciously transform one's thoughts and grasp the thought revolutionization, it is easy to be defeated in the face of sugar bullets.

I come from a poor peasant family, and in the old society, I often went hungry. It was Chairman Mao who led us to rise up and gain liberation. After joining the revolution, I always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and, during the war years, shared weal and woe with the masses, maintaining the character of the working people. After national liberation, it was again Chairman Mao's teachings that showed me the direction. Chairman Mao said: "There may be such communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns, and they are not unworthy of the title of heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Chairman Mao's wise instructions have been my guide for action over the past decade. It is Chairman Mao's teachings that have always urged me to "eliminate bad habits and maintain good habits," striving to achieve: higher positions, fighting against "official" airs, the character of the working people does not change; more honors, fighting against "arrogant" airs, the style of being humble and prudent does not change; better living conditions, fighting against "spoiled" airs, the tradition of being frugal and simple does not change; older age, fighting against "twilight" airs, the vigorous revolutionary spirit does not change.

Nineteen years ago, Chairman Mao's warning about preventing the attack of sugar-coated bullets is the deepest concern and greatest care for every revolutionary, pointing out the fundamental way to prevent revisionism and prevent changes after the victory of the revolution. It still has particularly great contemporary significance today. The class enemies under the dictatorship of the proletariat mainly use sugar-coated bullets to attack, carrying out peaceful evolution, and restoring capitalism. We must continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, constantly smash the attack of sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, constantly carry out thought reform, and forever preserve the revolutionary youth!

    英明的预见　伟大的纲领
    ——沈阳部队几位战斗英雄重新学习毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的体会
    中国人民解放军沈阳部队全国战斗英雄赵兴元、郅顺义、毛国、常恩举等，在学习党的八届十二中全会公报的同时，重新学习了毛主席的《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这篇划时代的马克思列宁主义文献。当年，他们曾在紧张的战斗中，听到这一重要报告精神的传达；后来，他们又在一九五○年全国战斗英雄代表会议上，直接聆听过毛主席的伟大教导。现在，经过十九年来阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实践，特别是经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，重新学习毛主席的这一光辉历史文献，感到特别亲切。他们一致认为：这篇光辉文献具有伟大的历史意义和现实意义。学习这篇文献，对于贯彻执行党的第八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项任务，深刻理解党内两条路线斗争的历史，进一步领会毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，都具有极其重要的意义。
    警惕“不拿枪的敌人”
    全国战斗英雄、某师师长赵兴元说：
    在夺取全国胜利的前夕，毛主席就用马克思列宁主义的阶级分析，科学地、深刻地分析了全国胜利后的阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争，指出国内的基本矛盾将是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，并且特别告诫我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”十九年来阶级斗争的事实，完全证明了毛主席这一英明的预见。
    回想在战争年代，我们主要是和拿枪的敌人战斗，敌情观念很强，革命警惕性很高。胜利以后，自己对“不拿枪的敌人”的警惕性，就不如对拿枪的敌人警惕性那样高，敌情观念也比战争时期淡薄了。为什么会出现这种现象呢？我曾带着这个问题反复学习了毛主席著作，特别是在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，狠触了自己的灵魂，发现思想深处存在着一种“定局论”，错误地认为，个人“定局”了，革命也“定局”了。用这种观点看形势，必然缺乏阶级斗争观念，看不到阶级敌人，首先是看不到自己头脑里的“敌人”，更看不清隐藏在我们队伍内部的“打着红旗反红旗”的阶级敌人。所以，当毛主席发出“特别是要警惕在中央出修正主义”的警告时，自己就很不理解。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我受到了深刻的教育，认识到：无产阶级专政条件下的革命，就是要革“不拿枪的敌人”的命。而这些“不拿枪的敌人”，不单是那些没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右，最主要的还是那些篡夺了党和国家重要领导岗位的资产阶级代理人。刘少奇就是他们的总代表。在我们党的历史上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在每一个重要时刻，在每一个重大问题上，都进行了尖锐的斗争。对于无产阶级专政条件下两个阶级、两条路线斗争的新形势、新特点，有“定局论”思想的人是怎么也认不清、分不明的，不仅如此，还有可能在这伙“不拿枪的敌人”面前，中毒不知毒，以致脑袋掉了，还不知道怎么掉的！
    我是解放军的一名战士。过去，在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，用枪杆子打败了拿枪的敌人；今后，我一定遵照伟大统帅毛主席的指示，学会同“不拿枪的敌人”作斗争。“不拿枪的敌人”不象拿枪的敌人那样容易识破，但我坚信：只要掌握了毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜和显微镜，一切“不拿枪的敌人”，不管他们多么狡猾，伪装得多么巧妙，都逃脱不了覆灭的下场。
    坚决捍卫无产阶级的生命权
    全国战斗英雄、某团副团长毛国说：
    毛主席在七届二中全会上作的这篇重要报告中，多次地反复地提到“建立政权”、“维持政权”的问题，并且明确地指出：“工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。”毛主席的教导，归根结底是告诫我们：夺权不易，保权更不易。
    “中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”十九年来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，充分说明：革命以后的路程，长就长在巩固无产阶级专政上，伟大就伟大在巩固无产阶级专政上，艰苦也就艰苦在巩固无产阶级专政上。全国胜利后的十九年，就是同不拿枪的国民党反动派作斗争的十九年；是全国军民在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，捍卫无产阶级政权、巩固无产阶级专政的十九年。
    我们“支左”的舒兰煤矿，长期以来，一小撮走资派秉承其黑主子刘少奇的旨意，招降纳叛，结党营私，网罗了一批特务、叛徒、反革命分子，篡夺了矿里的领导权。在他们的控制下，大搞“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”，使一个在全国胜利以后才兴办起来的社会主义企业，几乎滑进了资本主义的泥坑。就在这时候，毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，广大革命职工起来造了矿里一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权，建立了三结合的革命委员会，全矿面貌焕然一新。广大革命职工激动地说：“再不搞文化大革命，就要亡党、亡国。多亏毛主席他老人家非常及时地发动了这场文化大革命，巩固了无产阶级专政，保住了咱们无产阶级的江山！”
    矿工们的肺腑之言，说出了巩固无产阶级政权的重大意义。政权，就是无产阶级的生存权、生命权。无产阶级有了政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切。
    我是革命三结合革委会中的军队代表。军队在国家政权中占的地位极其重要，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。毛主席派军队代表参加革命三结合，是巩固无产阶级专政的伟大战略措施，是保卫无产阶级生存权、生命权的英明决策。我决心以无限忠于毛主席的实际行动，坚决完成毛主席交给的光荣任务，在革命三结合的权力机构中带头搞好思想革命化，发挥人民解放军的柱石作用，和革命干部代表、革命群众代表一起，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。
    在上层建筑领域实行无产阶级专政
    全国战斗英雄、某团政治处副主任常恩举说：
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会报告中指示我们：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争”。过去，我对毛主席在这里指出的“文化斗争”认识是不足的。我总想：毛主席把我从苦海里解放出来，又把枪杆子交给我，我只要握紧手中枪，紧跟毛主席闹革命，毛主席指向那里我就打到那里。至于文化斗争，那是耍笔杆子的事，咱当兵的不用操那份心。现在看来，我们工农兵光抓枪杆子，光抓锤把子、锄把子，不抓笔杆子，确实是个大问题。
    全国胜利以来，以刘少奇为代表的一小撮走资派，为了复辟资本主义，拚命推行反革命修正主义的文艺路线和教育路线，把我们的学校、舞台、书报刊物变成培养修正主义的温床，妄想夺权先夺人，夺人先夺魂。阶级斗争的事实，使我深刻地认识到，毛主席要我们学会进行文化斗争，就是要我们在上层建筑领域里向阶级敌人发动进攻，从资产阶级手中夺回文权，在上层建筑包括一切文化领域中实行无产阶级专政。
    文权不夺，政权难保，苦根子也挖不掉。今天，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的命令，浩浩荡荡地登上了上层建筑各个领域斗批改的政治舞台，在上层建筑领域实行无产阶级专政。这是古今中外从来没有过的翻天覆地的大事。我们革命战士誓作工人阶级的坚强后盾，坚决拥护工人阶级领导一切，坚决支持工人阶级对一切上层建筑领域实行全面的无产阶级专政。我们要在握紧枪杆子的同时，抓紧笔杆子，坚决捍卫无产阶级的文权，在文化斗争中发挥应有的作用。
    彻底粉碎糖衣炮弹的攻击
    全国战斗英雄、沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某师后勤部副政委郅顺义说：
    伟大领袖毛主席早在十九年前就及时地警告我们，在夺取全国胜利以后，阶级斗争形势起了新的变化，特别要警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻。十几年来，在革命队伍里，已经有这样一些人，过去还是革命的，但在资产阶级糖弹的攻击下，却变成了资产阶级在我们党内的代理人。敌人的糖弹往往比钢弹还厉害，钢弹不能保住敌人的反动统治时，他们就用糖弹来腐蚀我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。
    “务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”这是伟大领袖毛主席在夺取全国胜利前夕，向全党全军发出的继续革命的伟大号召。十几年来的实践，特别是两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我深深体会到：要想在夺取全国胜利以后，紧跟毛主席继续干革命，首先必须自觉地革自己的命，既当革命的一份力量，又当革命的对象。
    胜利以来，由于形势发展的需要，党和人民给我的职位越来越高，荣誉越来越多，生活越来越好，自己的年龄也越来越大。我觉察到：职位高了，容易产生“官”气；荣誉多了，容易产生“骄”气；生活好了，容易产生“娇”气；年龄大了，容易产生“暮”气。在这种情况下，如果不自觉地改造思想，狠抓思想革命化，就容易在糖弹面前打败仗。
    我出身于贫农家庭，在旧社会，吃了这顿没那顿。是毛主席领导我们翻身得了解放。参加革命后，我牢记毛主席的教导，在战争年月里，和群众一起同甘共苦，保持劳动人民的本色。在全国解放以后，又是毛主席的教导给我指明了方向。毛主席说：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”毛主席这一英明的指示，成了我十几年来的行动指南。是毛主席的教导经常鞭策自己“去掉不良作风，保持优良作风”，努力做到职位高了，狠斗“官”气，劳动人民的本色不变；荣誉多了，狠斗“骄”气，谦虚谨慎的作风不变；生活好了，狠斗“娇”气，艰苦朴素的传统不变；年龄大了，狠斗“暮”气，旺盛的革命干劲不变。
    十九年前，毛主席关于预防糖衣炮弹攻击的警告，是对每个革命者最深切的关怀，最大的爱护，指出了革命胜利后反修、防变的根本途径。在今天仍然具有特别伟大的现实意义。无产阶级专政下的阶级敌人，主要是采取糖衣炮弹的攻击，实行和平演变，复辟资本主义。我们在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命，就要不断粉碎资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，不断进行思想改造，永葆革命的青春！　沈新
