November 1st evening was an unforgettable, thrilling night without sleep. The sound of drums and firecrackers shook the night sky over the Beijing Knitting Factory, and the loudspeakers repeatedly broadcast the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The factory-wide celebration meeting had just ended, and the parade teams from each brigade marched out onto the streets with high spirits.

It was already midnight when the parade returned, and representatives from each brigade gathered in the conference room of the office building to discuss the great significance of the communiqué.

Old worker Zhang Meiyu and Chen Dong, who had suffered the most in the old society, were the most excited that night. Zhang Meiyu, who had started working as a child laborer at the age of seven, recalled her own bloody history as soon as she heard the communiqué. She could not suppress her anger towards Liu Shaoqi, the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader. She remembered that when she first came from Shanghai to the Beijing Knitting Factory, Liu Shaoqi's agent did not allow her to study Chairman Mao's works. She thought: I am a Communist Party member, how can I do my job without studying Mao Zedong Thought? But Liu Shaoqi's agent told her nonsense: "You work in the nursery, as long as you keep the place clean every day, that's the biggest politics!" When she tried to educate the next generation with her own painful history, she was accused of "showing off." She thought: Chairman Mao teaches us "never forget class struggle," why do some people not let me conduct class education for the next generation? Through this Cultural Revolution, she finally realized that the root of the problem lay with Liu Shaoqi, the counter-revolutionary revisionist. Zhang Meiyu heard that Liu Shaoqi, the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader, was permanently expelled from the Party and stripped of all his positions inside and outside the Party. She was so moved that she cried and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Chen Dong, a 58-year-old old cook, started crying as soon as he opened his mouth. This new Party member who had just joined during the Cultural Revolution, this old worker who had suffered in the old society for half his life, was thrilled to hear that Liu Shaoqi, the big bad guy, was permanently expelled from the Party and stripped of all his positions inside and outside the Party. He repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao a thousand times!"

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is absolutely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Chen Dong felt deeply about Chairman Mao's great teaching because, like Zhang Meiyu, he understood from his own experience that whether the leadership of the Party and the country is in the hands of Marxists or revisionists is a matter of life and death for the hundreds of millions of laboring people. Chen Dong's hometown is Jing County, Hebei. He was born without a single room or a piece of land, and he had suffered all kinds of hardships. At the age of fifteen, he became a hired hand for a rich peasant. He said: Liu Shaoqi's words were the same as the rich peasant's. When he was a hired hand, the rich peasant said: "You poor people rely on us rich people to live. If you want to work for me, I will feed you." Later, he could no longer bear it and walked thousands of miles to Beijing on foot, only to become a slave for the capitalist, working to death but still unable to support his family. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who saved him from the sea of suffering. After liberation, he devoted himself to the revolution under Chairman Mao's leadership and had applied to join the Communist Party long ago, but Liu Shaoqi's agent in the knitting factory would not allow him to join.

Chen Dong said excitedly, Chairman Mao is truly more loving than a father, more loving than a mother. Without Chairman Mao, there would be nothing for the working class. He is determined to strive to complete the great mission given to the working class by Chairman Mao to lead everything, and to always put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work.

Zhang Meiyu and Chen Dong's speeches expressed the common voice of the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory.

The workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, were greatly inspired after hearing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the radio. They organized study and discussion throughout the night, enthusiastically welcomed the issuance of the communiqué, and decided to resolutely overthrow the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi.

### 敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！

    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    十一月一日晚上，是一个难忘的激动人心的不眠之夜。锣鼓声和爆竹声震荡着北京针织总厂的夜空，扩音器里一遍又一遍地传送着党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报。
    全厂的庆祝大会刚刚结束，各个连队的游行队伍便斗志昂扬地走上了街头。　
    游行回来已经是深夜十二点了，各个连队的代表们又来到办公楼的会议室畅谈公报的伟大意义。
    老工人张美娣和陈栋，在旧社会受苦最深，这天晚上他们也最激动。从七岁就开始当童工的张美娣，一听到公报就回忆起了自己血泪斑斑的历史，抑制不住对刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼的满腔怒火。她回忆起自己刚从上海到北京针织总厂，刘少奇的代理人就不准她学习毛主席著作。她想：自己是一个共产党员，不学习毛泽东思想怎么能做好工作？可是刘少奇的代理人却对她胡说什么：“你在托儿所工作，每天把卫生打扫好了就是最大的政治！”当她用自己的苦难历史教育下一代时，却被诬为是“出风头”。她想：毛主席教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，为什么偏偏有人不让我向下一代进行阶级教育呢？通过这次文化大革命，她才知道了总根子就在刘少奇这个反革命修正主义分子身上。张美娣听到把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，她激动得含着热泪一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”
    五十八岁的老炊事员陈栋，还没开口就激动得流下了眼泪。这个在文化大革命中刚刚入党的新党员，这个在旧社会的苦水里泡了多半辈子的老工人，听到把刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，兴奋得一遍遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”陈栋对毛主席这一伟大教导感触最深，因为他和张美娣一样，他从自己的亲身经历中，深深体会到党和国家的领导权掌握在马克思主义者或修正主义者手里，是使亿万劳动人民得到一切或失去一切的大问题。陈栋的家乡是河北景县，他生下来就房无一间，地无一垄，吃尽了人间辛苦，刚刚十五岁就给富农当了雇工。他说：刘少奇的话和富农说的一模一样，我当雇工时，富农就说：“你们穷人是靠我们有钱的人来养活的，你情愿给我干活，我情愿管你吃饭。”后来他实在熬不下去，千里迢迢徒步来到北京，又给资本家当牛马，拚死拚活地干活，还是养不活一家，是伟大领袖毛主席把他从苦海里救了出来。解放后，他一心一意跟着毛主席干革命，老早就申请加入共产党，可是刘少奇在针织总厂的代理人就是不准他入党。
    陈栋非常激动地说，毛主席他老人家真是比爹亲，比娘亲。没有毛主席也就没有工人阶级的一切。他决心努力完成毛主席他老人家赋予工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大使命，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。
    张美娣和陈栋的发言，表达了北京针织总厂广大革命职工的共同心声。
