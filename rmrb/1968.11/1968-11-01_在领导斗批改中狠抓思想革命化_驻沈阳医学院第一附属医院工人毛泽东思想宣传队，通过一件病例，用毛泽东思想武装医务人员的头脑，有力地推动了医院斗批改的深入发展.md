The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College, through a case of a patient, armed the medical staff with Mao Zedong Thought, and powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the hospital's struggle, criticism, and reform.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp ideological education as the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles," has emphasized proletarian politics and focused on the ideological revolutionization of people, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and reform in this hospital.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great directive that the working class must lead everything, a propaganda team composed of workers and PLA soldiers entered the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College. After the propaganda team entered the hospital and conducted investigations, they discovered the following incident: Recently, Jin Yuting, deputy chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Poor Peasants' Representative Assembly and a model worker, was admitted to the hospital with advanced nephritis and uremia. After admission, he was labeled as having an "incurable disease" according to the framework of bourgeois reactionary "experts" and was left untreated, causing his condition to worsen and going three days and nights without a drop of water. In this situation, Jin Yuting still tightly held the Chairman Mao badge on his chest and repeatedly murmured, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I have not completed the task given to me by you, old man." Seeing this scene, the team members were moved to tears. However, some doctors remained very indifferent, saying, "Even if we are moved, there is nothing we can do."

Is there really nothing that can be done? Why are the doctors so indifferent to the poor and lower-middle peasants? The propaganda team, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "look at things from their essence and regard their phenomena only as guides to entering the door, and once inside the door, grasp their essence," seriously analyzed this incident and believed that the problem lies in the fact that some medical and nursing staff have long been corrupted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line promoted by China's Khrushchev, and their ideology is not revolutionized.

To promote the ideological revolutionization of medical and nursing staff and drive the struggle, criticism, and reform in the hospital, the workers' propaganda team led the medical and nursing staff to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions on medical and health work, vigorously carry out the "three loyalties" activity of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. Through revolutionary criticism, the medical and nursing staff further recognized the reactionary essence of the revisionist medical and health line. Medical and nursing staff throughout the hospital unanimously demanded the immediate formation of a rescue team to treat the good representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Jin Yuting. Under the leadership of the workers' propaganda team, a rescue team composed of doctors, nurses, and medical workers, after more than twenty days and nights of careful treatment, finally rescued Comrade Jin Yuting. This is a powerful criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line and a profound education for the medical and nursing staff on the struggle between the two lines.

The workers' propaganda team drew further experience from this incident in leading the struggle, criticism, and reform. They realized that in leading the hospital's struggle, criticism, and reform, it is necessary to arm the medical and nursing staff with Mao Zedong Thought and focus on the ideological revolutionization of people.

Based on this understanding, the workers' propaganda team, in leading the struggle, criticism, and reform, consciously implemented the leadership of proletarian politics, armed the broad medical and nursing staff with Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted their change in worldview. Now, the struggle, criticism, and reform in this hospital have taken on a new look. After the medical and nursing staff established the idea of "everything for the workers, peasants, and soldiers," they quickly smashed the old rules that had been in place for many years and established new systems such as day and night registration and comprehensive outpatient services. For some patients who came from distant rural areas and could not return on the same day, they also set up reception rooms and simple beds, provided free accommodation, and convenienced the masses. The broad masses praised this change, saying, "Now, when we come to this hospital for treatment, the registration and treatment time is fast, there is reception at night, we are pleased to see the new look of the hospital, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are warmed in their hearts."

    在领导斗批改中狠抓思想革命化
    驻沈阳医学院第一附属医院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，通过一件病例，用毛泽东思想武装医务人员的头脑，有力地推动了医院斗批改的深入发展
    据新华社沈阳电　驻沈阳医学院第一附属医院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓人的思想革命化，有力地推动这所医院斗、批、改的深入发展。
    在毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大指示的指引下，一支有解放军战士参加的工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进了沈阳医学院第一附属医院。工人宣传队进院后，在调查研究中发现这样一件事：辽宁省贫代会副主任、劳动模范金玉廷前不久患肾炎晚期尿毒症进了这个医院。入院后，被按照资产阶级反动技术“权威”规定的框框宣布为“不治之症”，推到一边不管，致使患者病情恶化，三天三夜滴水不进。在这种情况下，金玉廷仍然紧紧抚摸着胸前的毛主席像章，不住地叨念：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我没有完成您老人家交给的任务。”见到这种情景，宣传队的同志感动得热泪盈眶。但是个别医生却十分冷淡，说什么“感动也没办法”。
    真的没有办法吗？医生为什么对贫下中农这样冷淡？宣传队遵照毛主席“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质”的教导，对这件事作了认真的分析，认为问题在于一些医护人员长期受中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的腐蚀，思想不革命化。
    为了促进医护人员的思想革命化，带动医院的斗、批、改的深入进行，工人宣传队领导医护人员大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、深刻领会毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的指示，大力开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线。通过革命大批判，医护人员对修正主义医疗卫生路线的反动实质有了进一步认识。全院医护人员纷纷要求立即组成抢救小组，为贫下中农的好代表金玉廷治病。在工人宣传队的领导下，一个由医生、护士、卫生员参加的抢救小组经过二十多个日日夜夜的精心治疗，终于把金玉廷同志抢救过来了。这是对反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的有力批判，对医护人员是一次深刻的两条路线斗争的教育。
    工人宣传队从这件事情中，进一步总结了领导斗、批、改的经验。他们体会到，在领导医院斗、批、改中，必须用毛泽东思想武装医护人员的头脑，狠抓人的思想革命化。
    在这个认识的基础上，工人宣传队在领导斗、批、改中，更加自觉地实行无产阶级政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想武装广大医护人员的头脑，促进他们世界观的转变。现在，这个医院的斗、批、改出现了一片崭新气象。医护人员确立了“一切为着工农兵”的思想后，很快就砸碎了多少年来的旧规程，建立昼夜挂号，综合门诊的新制度。有些从农村远道来的患者，当天不能返回，他们还设了接待室和简易病床，免费接待，方便了群众。广大群众赞扬这种变化说：“现在到这个医院治病，挂号诊治时间快，夜间来诊有接待，喜看医院新面貌，贫下中农暖胸怀。”
