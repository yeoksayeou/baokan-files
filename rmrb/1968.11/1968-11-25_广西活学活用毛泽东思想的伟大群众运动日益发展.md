Since the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the focus has been on the fundamentals, with the entire region, both urban and rural, setting up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Over 23 million people have participated in these studies. After the publication of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee's communiqué, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire region has reached a new high. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely disseminated, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people. The spiritual face of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups has undergone a fundamental change, powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform, as well as various production and construction tasks.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanning on the 24th, since the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the focus has been on the fundamentals, placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been extensively set up and conducted well, leading to new developments in the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the region. The spiritual face of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups has undergone a fundamental change, powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform, as well as various production and construction tasks.

Since March this year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has established revolutionary committees from the bottom up. By August, when the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established, all prefectures, cities, and counties in the region had achieved a complete red status. Under the guidance of the resolution passed at the first plenary meeting of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee on "Promoting the Great Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought to a New Stage," various levels of revolutionary committees have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "setting up study classes is a good method" and extensively set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. From cities to the most remote mountains and islands, from government agencies, schools, rural communes to inns and fishing boats, study classes can be found everywhere, and everywhere is a classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating private and revisionist thoughts. According to incomplete statistics, since the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, over 660,000 study classes of various types have been held throughout the region, with over 23 million people participating in the studies. In the Nanning, Qinzhou, and Baise prefectures, over 255,000 revolutionary households have set up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with everyone from children to the elderly reading Chairman Mao's books and reporting to Chairman Mao every day. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely disseminated, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people. After the publication of the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups throughout the region have pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. Various places have extensively held specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement the calls of the plenary session. In just 20 days, over 240,000 specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held throughout the region, with over 7 million people participating in the studies.

In the study classes and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups have promoted the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, as advocated by Chairman Mao, and have applied what they have learned from Mao Zedong Thought. They use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie, criticize revisionism, criticize the old world, and transform the old world; they use Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate private thoughts and establish public thoughts, transform their worldviews, and change the entire social spiritual face. Currently, under Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform," the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups throughout the region are using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Guangxi, He Ximin, and Xie Wangang, who have promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. With the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, work such as rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, sending cadres to labor, and the cultural revolution of the proletariat is also vigorously underway. The cause of socialist construction has also presented a new and inspiring leap. The production of coal, light industry, chemical industry, handicrafts, and other products throughout the region has been increasing month by month. Based on the early rice harvest, the late rice is also expected to have a good harvest. "Learning from Dazhai, walking the Dazhai path, and creating Dazhai achievements" has become the common battle cry of the poor and lower-middle peasants of all ethnic groups throughout the region. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups are determined to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely complete the various battle tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, and welcome the convening of the Party's Ninth National Congress.

    广西活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动日益发展
    自治区革命委员会成立后，狠抓根本，全区城乡大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，二千三百多万人次参加了学习。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，全区活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新的高潮。全区毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的革命路线空前深入人心。各族革命人民的精神面貌发生了根本变化，有力地推动了斗批改和各项生产建设
    据新华社南宁二十四日电　广西壮族自治区革命委员会成立以来，狠抓根本，把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，大办办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使全区活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动有了新的发展，各族革命人民的精神面貌发生了根本变化，有力地推动了斗、批、改和各项生产建设工作。
    广西壮族自治区自今年三月以来，自下而上地普遍建立了各级革命委员会。到今年八月广西壮族自治区革命委员会成立时，全区各专区、市、县全部实现了一片红。在自治区革委会第一次全体委员扩大会议通过的《关于把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向更新阶段的决议》的推动下，各级革委会遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法”的伟大教导，普遍大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。全区从城市到最偏远的山村、海岛，从机关、学校、农村人民公社到旅店、渔船，到处都有学习班，到处都是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，斗私批修的战场。据不完全统计，自治区革委会成立以来，全区就举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六十六万多期，有二千三百多万人次参加了学习。南宁、钦州、百色三个专区还有二十五万五千多户革命群众，办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，从几岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，人人读毛主席的书，天天向毛主席请示、汇报。全区毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的革命路线空前深入人心。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，全区各族革命群众把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新的高潮。各地纷纷举办落实全会公报号召的各种专题毛泽东思想学习班。二十天内，全区就举办各种专题毛泽东思想学习班二十四万多期，有七百多万人次参加了学习。
    各族广大革命群众在学习班里，在活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，对毛泽东思想学了就用。他们用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级，批判修正主义，批判旧世界、改造旧世界；用毛泽东思想破私立公，改造世界观，改变整个社会精神面貌。当前，全区各族广大革命群众遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示，正以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在广西的代理人贺希明、谢王岗之流所推行的反革命修正主义路线。随着革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作的深入发展，整党、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、干部下放劳动和无产阶级教育革命等项工作，也正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开。社会主义建设事业也出现了令人鼓舞的新的跃进局面。全区煤炭工业、轻工业、化学工业、手工业等产品产量都直线上升，情况一个月比一个月好。农业在早稻丰收的基础上，晚稻又将获得好收成。“学大寨人，走大寨路，创大寨业绩”，已成为全区各族贫下中农的共同战斗口号。各族革命人民决心更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想为武器，坚决完成党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开。
