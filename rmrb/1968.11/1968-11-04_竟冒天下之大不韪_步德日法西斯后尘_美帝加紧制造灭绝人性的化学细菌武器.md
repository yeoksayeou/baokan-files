The desperate U.S. imperialists are increasing their budget, expanding their facilities, and speeding up the production of inhuman chemical and biological weapons in a vain attempt to use these weapons in their dying struggle.

According to a recent report by the American *New York Times Magazine*, as the U.S. imperialists suffer continuous defeats in their aggression against Vietnam, their budget for chemical and biological warfare is increasing: in the fiscal year of 1962, nearly $100 million was allocated for this purpose, and in the following three years, this amount increased to nearly $300 million per year. In the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, over $70 million was spent solely on the purchase of defoliants.

The report revealed that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are rapidly expanding their research on chemical and biological weapons. The Army alone has established five highly secret chemical and biological warfare bases, employing over 13,000 personnel.

Since this year, Western news agencies have repeatedly disclosed that the U.S. imperialists are conducting large-scale tests of chemical and biological weapons in the form of artillery shells, landmines, missiles, or aerial spraying in tropical areas such as the Panama Canal Zone, Arctic regions like Greenland, and within the United States itself.

The U.S. imperialists are openly defying the world's condemnation and following in the footsteps of German and Japanese fascists by conducting large-scale tests of bacteriological and chemical warfare. This will not save them from their doom but will instead provoke even greater indignation from the revolutionary people of the world, thereby hastening their own downfall.

    竟冒天下之大不韪　步德日法西斯后尘
    美帝加紧制造灭绝人性的化学细菌武器
    据新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：穷途末路的美帝国主义正在增加经费、扩充设备、加紧制造灭绝人性的化学和细菌武器，妄图借助这些武器来进行垂死挣扎。
    据美国《纽约时报杂志》不久前报道，随着侵越战争的不断惨败，美帝国主义用于化学和生物战的经费正在不断增加：一九六二年财政年度的预算中，这方面的经费将近一亿美元，在以后的三年中增加到每年将近三亿美元。而在今年七月一日开始的本财政年度内，仅用于购置落叶剂的经费就高达七千多万美元。
    报道透露，美国的陆、海、空军都在迅速扩大化学和生物武器的研究工作。单是陆军就设立了五个“高度保密”的化学和生物战基地，雇用一万三千多名工作人员。
    今年以来，西方通讯社曾多次透露，美帝国主义正在热带的巴拿马运河区，寒带的格陵兰和美国国内，大规模试验炮弹、地雷、导弹形式的或飞机喷撒的化学和细菌武器。
    美帝国主义公然冒天下之大不韪，步德、日法西斯后尘，大规模进行细菌战和化学战的试验，这不仅挽救不了它灭亡的命运，相反，只能激起全世界革命人民更大的愤慨，从而加速它末日的到来。
