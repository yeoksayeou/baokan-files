As we are earnestly studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our red sun in our hearts, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee has been republished. The Central News Agency and the two newspapers have also issued an important editorial, conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, heard this great news and jumped for joy. Inside and outside Shaoshan, there was a wave of excitement, and everyone enthusiastically shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao's report and his latest instructions are our guiding light, our ideological weapon for continuing the revolution. We—the poor and lower-middle peasants of Chairman Mao's hometown—have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, made great strides on the revolutionary path and achieved new victories. Reflecting on the glorious history of our Party's struggle, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, deeply feel that the history of our Party is the history of the struggle between two lines, the history of the continuous victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the reactionary bourgeois line of Liu Shaoqi and others.

Over the decades, Chairman Mao has led the people of the entire nation to defeat domestic and foreign class enemies, smashing various opportunist lines of "left" and "right" deviations, achieving one great victory after another. In the difficult years when the people of our country were oppressed by the three great mountains, it was the great leader Mao Zedong who raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, personally initiated and led the peasant revolutionary movement in the Shaoshan area, and personally established the first party branch in China's rural areas—the Shaoshan branch of the Communist Party of China. The entire Mao family, for the liberation of the oppressed people, had six family members who sacrificed their precious lives. In the fierce land reform, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants stood up, gaining political rights. However, Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur, stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, falsely claiming that "exploitation is beneficial" and that "capitalists are too few," shielding evil landlords and protecting rich peasants, and sabotaging land reform. It was the great leader Mao Zedong who timely exposed Liu's plot, leading us to victory and making the land reform movement achieve great success. Chairman Mao's brilliant comments on the materials of the Qingfeng Township Agricultural Cooperative pointed the way forward for the people of the entire nation, giving us boundless strength, and the agricultural cooperatives were quickly established. In 1956, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Shaoshan area, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, joined the agricultural cooperativization movement, bringing about a socialist upsurge in the countryside. In 1958, the people of Shaoshan raised high the three red banners, established people's communes, and accelerated socialist revolution and socialist construction. Liu Shaoqi, this great scoundrel, was again terrified and enraged, and carried out savage persecution against the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, labeling the Shaoshan party branch, which insisted on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely followed the socialist path, as a "fortress branch," and fifty-six out of the fifty-eight party members were labeled with "white flags." In 1961, our country encountered temporary economic difficulties due to three consecutive years of natural disasters. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "seeing achievements and light in times of difficulty," raised high the three red banners, fought against nature, fought against the earth, and fought against revisionism, determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. At this time, Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, again infiltrated Shaoshan, savagely sabotaged the construction of Shaoshan, opposed the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and successively sent his agents to Shaoshan to carry out individual farming trials, savagely promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and pushing "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms." We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely followed Chairman Mao and fought against them head-on, making their plots unsuccessful.

In 1963, when we poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan were advancing victoriously along the path guided by the ten conditions personally formulated by Chairman Mao for the socialist education movement in rural areas, Liu Shaoqi hurriedly returned to Hunan, peddling his black goods "Peach Garden Experience," and carried out a "left" in form but right in essence, sabotaging the socialist education movement in Shaoshan. However, the children of Chairman Mao's hometown always listen to Chairman Mao's words, do not pay attention to his tricks, and resisted his counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieved great victory.

The thunderous roar of spring thunder. The blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, has exposed the counter-revolutionary face of Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur, and his counter-revolutionary plots have been thoroughly foiled. His bourgeois headquarters have been completely smashed by the revolutionary people who hold high the Mao Zedong Thought, and Liu Shaoqi is completely finished. We have removed the stumbling block on the path of progress, uprooted the representative of the capitalist restoration forces, and exposed the backstage boss of the ghosts and monsters. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, from the bottom of our hearts, thank Chairman Mao for his good leadership and praise Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for life, follow Chairman Mao's path for life, and revolutionize with Chairman Mao for life.

    走毛主席的路就是胜利
    湖南韶山贫下中农代表　毛再遂
    正当我们认真学习党的八届十二中全会公报的时候，我们心中的红太阳、我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告重新发表了。中央两报一刊还为此发表了重要社论，传达了毛主席他老人家的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”我们韶山的贫下中农听了这个大喜讯，喜得跳了起来。韶山冲里冲外，一片欢腾，大家一个劲地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席的报告和最新指示，是我们的指路明灯，是我们继续进行革命的思想武器。我们——毛主席家乡的贫下中农，过去在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在革命的道路上大步前进，不断地取得新胜利。回想党的光荣斗争历史，我们韶山的贫下中农深深体会到：我们党的历史就是两条路线斗争的历史，就是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线不断地战胜刘少奇等的资产阶级反动路线的历史。
    几十年来，毛主席他老人家率领全国人民战胜了国内外的阶级敌人，粉碎了各种“左”右倾机会主义路线，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在我国人民深受三座大山压迫的艰苦年月里，是伟大领袖毛主席，高举马列主义的革命大旗，亲自发动和领导了韶山地区的农民革命运动，亲手缔造了我国农村最早的党支部——中共韶山支部。毛主席全家为了被压迫人民的翻身解放，先后有六位亲人献出了宝贵的生命。在轰轰烈烈的土地改革中，广大贫下中农得到了翻身，得到了政治权利。可是，刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼，站在资产阶级的反动立场上，胡说“剥削有功”、资本家“太少”，包庇恶霸地主，保护富农，破坏土地改革。是伟大领袖毛主席，及时识破了刘贼的阴谋，带领我们胜利前进，使土改运动取得了伟大的胜利。毛主席亲自为清风乡农业合作社的材料写下的光辉按语，为全国人民指明了前进的道路，给了我们无穷的力量，农业合作社很快就建立起来。一九五六年，韶山地区的贫下中农在毛主席的英明领导下，投入了农业合作化运动，使农村出现了社会主义高潮。一九五八年，韶山人民高举三面红旗，成立了人民公社，加速了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。刘少奇这个大坏蛋，又怕得要死，恨得要命，对韶山的贫下中农进行了疯狂的迫害，把坚持毛主席革命路线，坚定不移地走社会主义道路的韶山党支部打成“碉堡支部”，党支部的五十八名党员中有五十六人被插上了“白旗”。一九六一年，我国遇到了由于连续三年自然灾害造成的暂时的经济困难，我们遵照毛主席“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明”的教导，高举三面红旗，与天斗，与地斗，与修正主义斗，决心排除万难，去争取胜利。就在这个时候，刘少奇这个大叛徒又流窜到韶山，疯狂破坏韶山建设，反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，并先后两次派他的代理人到韶山搞单干试点，疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞“三自一包”、“四大自由”。我们贫下中农坚决跟毛主席走，与他们作了针锋相对的斗争，使他们的阴谋没有得逞。
    一九六三年，当我们韶山贫下中农正沿着毛主席亲自主持制订的农村社会主义教育运动的前十条指引的道路胜利前进的时候，刘少奇又急急忙忙地窜回湖南，贩卖他的黑货“桃园经验”，大搞形“左”实右，破坏韶山的社会主义教育运动。可是毛主席家乡的儿女永远听毛主席的话，不理他那一套，抵制了他的反革命修正主义路线，毛主席的革命路线取得了伟大的胜利。
    春雷一声震天响。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，使刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的反革命嘴脸现了原形，他的反革命阴谋彻底破产了，他的资产阶级司令部被掌握毛泽东思想的革命人民彻底摧垮了，刘少奇彻底完蛋了。我们搬掉了前进道路上的绊脚石，挖出了资本主义复辟势力的总代表，揪出了牛鬼蛇神的总后台，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。我们韶山贫下中农从心眼里感谢毛主席的好领导，歌颂毛主席的革命路线好。我们决心读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子毛主席的路，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
