The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the personnel of the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, armed with the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, continue to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism. Using the communiqué as a mirror, they summarize experiences, identify gaps, and formulate measures to further improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They are striving to accomplish the great combat tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenum of the Party.

The revolutionary workers and the personnel of the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, who are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are studying the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee with the spirit of "seizing the day." They are resolutely implementing the great combat tasks proposed by the plenum. They are using the communiqué as the center, launching a campaign of extensive study and publicity; using the communiqué as a textbook, discussing the great victories of the Cultural Revolution; using the communiqué as a weapon, continuing to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism; using the communiqué as a mirror, summarizing experiences, identifying gaps, and formulating measures to further improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They are determined to, through the study of the communiqué, be even more loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts to a new level, and to raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to a new level.

On the evening of the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed in the factory studied it repeatedly throughout the night. Everyone unanimously recognized that the central committee plenary session, which was presided over by the great leader Chairman Mao, was a meeting of great historical significance. The communiqué is a summary of the experience of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years, a beacon for carrying out the great struggle, criticism, and transformation, and a guarantee for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. It is a new combat mobilization order issued by the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to the revolutionary people of the whole country. Rapidly and comprehensively implementing the great combat tasks proposed by the plenum is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and to resolutely respond to the combat call of the proletarian headquarters. On the basis of raising awareness, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory immediately launched a campaign to study, publicize, and implement the communiqué of the plenum.

1. Using the communiqué as the center, launch a campaign of study and publicity. After the publication of the communiqué, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory held all-night mass meetings, parades, posted slogans, and performed artistic programs. Everyone listened to the broadcast again and again, discussed and debated repeatedly, and organized propaganda teams to stations, streets, and residential areas for publicity. In the study, the broad revolutionary workers generally achieved the following "close combinations": studying the communiqué and closely combining it with the study and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions; closely combining it with the new situation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines; closely combining it with the current tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory; closely combining it with promoting revolution, production, work, and preparedness for war; and closely combining it with promoting one's own ideological transformation.

2. Using the communiqué as a textbook, discuss the great victories of the Cultural Revolution. In the study and discussion, the broad revolutionary workers believed that the current situation of the Cultural Revolution is extremely good, with the most important sign being the unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, the unprecedented improvement of the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the people of the whole country, and the unprecedented consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. Revolutionary workers also combined the actual situation of the factory, discussing how, with the help of the comrades from the 8341st Unit sent by Chairman Mao, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and thus achieved the great situation of "people change their ideas, the factory changes its appearance, and revolution and production make great leaps." Through study and discussion, everyone had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching that "this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is completely necessary and extremely timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism," which is extremely wise and correct.

3. Using the communiqué as a weapon, continue to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory resolutely support the decision of this plenum to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party and to revoke all his positions inside and outside the Party. The broad workers and revolutionary cadres, with great indignation, held criticism meetings, wrote big-character posters, and denounced the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices of betraying the Party and the country. The broad revolutionary workers resolutely declared that they would continue to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary revisionist ideology of Liu Shaoqi and his like, the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

4. Using the communiqué as a mirror, summarize experiences, identify gaps, and formulate measures to further improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the study, everyone reviewed the two-year-plus battle course of the Cultural Revolution in the factory, and had a deeper understanding that closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, would be invincible. The members of the revolutionary committee of the factory and the broad revolutionary workers, taking workshops and teams as units, checked the work of the factory item by item against the tasks proposed in the communiqué. They found the weak links in their work and formulated improvement measures. Some units immediately organized investigation teams composed of old workers to investigate and study the reform of workshop regulations. Some units formulated measures to implement the great combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation more targeted.

At present, the revolutionary workers and the personnel stationed in the factory are continuing to study the communiqué of the plenum earnestly, with unbounded loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep proletarian feelings. They are publicizing the communiqué of the plenum with high revolutionary consciousness and implementing the great combat tasks proposed by the plenum with firm revolutionary will. They said proudly, "We must strive for glory for Chairman Mao, strive for glory, and strive for more glory! In the Cultural Revolution, we must achieve merits for the people, achieve merits, and achieve more merits!"

    新华社五日讯　紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的北京针织总厂广大革命职工和人民解放军八三四一部队驻厂支左人员，正在以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，认真学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报，坚决贯彻执行全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务。他们以公报为中心，掀起大学习大宣传的热潮；以公报为教材，畅谈文化大革命的伟大胜利；以公报为武器，继续深入开展革命大批判；以公报为镜子，总结经验，找出差距，订出进一步搞好斗、批、改的措施。他们决心通过对公报的学习，更加忠于伟大领袖毛主席，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提高到新高度，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提高到新高度。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的当天晚上，北京针织总厂革命委员会和八三四一部队驻厂支左人员通宵进行了反复学习。大家一致认识到，伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的这次中央全会，是一次有伟大历史意义的会议。全会公报是两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的经验总结，是搞好伟大的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部向全国革命人民发出的新的战斗动员令。迅速地、全面地落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是坚决响应无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。在提高认识的基础上，全厂革命职工立即掀起了一个学习、宣传、执行全会公报的热潮。
    一，以公报为中心，掀起学习和宣传的热潮。公报发表后，全厂革命职工通宵达旦地举行群众大会，庆祝游行，张贴标语，演出文艺节目。大家一遍又一遍地收听广播，一次又一次地座谈讨论，还组织宣传队到车站、街道和家属区宣传。在学习中，广大革命职工普遍做到了以下几个“紧密结合”；学习公报同活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示紧密结合；同当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的新形势紧密结合；同本厂当前斗、批、改的任务紧密结合；同抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备紧密结合；同促进自己的思想革命化紧密结合。
    二，以公报为教材，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。在学习和讨论中，广大革命职工认为，当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，最重要的标志是毛泽东思想空前大普及，全国人民两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，我国无产阶级专政空前巩固。革命职工还结合本厂实际，畅谈了他们在毛主席派来的亲人——八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，从而取得“人换思想厂换貌，革命、生产大飞跃”的大好形势。通过学习和讨论，大家更加深刻地认识到，毛主席的“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”这一教导，无比英明，无比正确。
    三，以公报为武器，继续深入开展革命大批判。全厂革命职工坚决拥护这次全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的决议。广大工人和革命干部，怀着无比强烈的革命义愤，纷纷召开批判会，写大字报，声讨刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。广大革命职工坚决表示，一定要继续深入展开革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。
    四，以公报为镜子，总结经验，找出差距，订出进一步搞好斗、批、改的措施。在学习中，大家回顾了两年多来本厂文化大革命的战斗历程，更加深刻地体会到，紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，条条落实毛主席的最新指示，就能无往而不胜。厂革委会成员和广大革命职工以车间、班组为单位，对照公报中提出的各项任务，逐条认真地检查了本厂的各项工作。他们狠找工作中的薄弱环节，订出了改进的措施。有的单位立即组织了由老工人组成的调查组，对进一步改革车间的规章制度进行调查研究。有的单位订出了落实公报提出的伟大战斗任务的措施，使斗、批、改有了更明确的目标。
    目前，这个厂的广大革命职工和支左人员，正怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情继续认真地学习全会公报，以高度的革命自觉热情宣传全会公报，以坚强的革命毅力坚决执行全会提出的伟大战斗任务。他们豪迈地说：“我们一定要为毛主席争光，争光，再争光！在文化大革命中为人民立功，立功，再立功！”
