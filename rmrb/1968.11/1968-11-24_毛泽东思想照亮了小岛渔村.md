Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out in a brilliant manner: “This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is absolutely necessary and extremely timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism.” Studying Chairman Mao’s brilliant directive has made me increasingly deeply understand the great practical significance and profound historical significance of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tells us: If it were not for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this proletarian political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and digging out the traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders like Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places, the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country would not be consolidated. Our country would change color, capitalism would be restored in our country, and we would suffer twice the hardships and twice the miseries.

The place where I participated in supporting the Left is the Caoyushi Production Team in the southern part of Haiyang Island, Liaoning Province. This small fishing village, located hundreds of miles from the mainland and home to twenty-nine households, is both a coastal defense outpost and a frontline of class struggle. Imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries often send spies here, attempting to infiltrate and use this place as a springboard for their aggression and subversion. Meanwhile, the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, through his agents here, vigorously promoted the revisionist goods of “self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency” and “four freedoms,” attempting to restore capitalism. Due to the collaboration and collusion of imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and Liu Shaoqi, for a period, the poor and lower-middle peasants in this small fishing village could not see Chairman Mao’s portrait, hear Chairman Mao’s teachings, or read Chairman Mao’s books. Capitalist spontaneous forces rose, and polarization became increasingly severe.

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao overthrew the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, and this small island also exposed a handful of bad elements. The masses’ consciousness greatly increased. Chairman Mao’s latest directives illuminated this small fishing village far from the mainland. Now, in this small fishing village, every household hangs Chairman Mao’s portrait, every household raises the red sun, Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread, and study classes are held in every home. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, using Chairman Mao’s latest directives as weapons and using the counterrevolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by Liu Shaoqi as targets, combined with the reality of class struggle in their village, deeply launched a revolutionary criticism. Everyone realized: Liu Shaoqi’s “self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency” is “poison coated with sugar, sweet to the mouth, but deadly to the intestines.” Under the guidance of Chairman Mao’s latest directive that “the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes,” this production team carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, exposing the bad elements mixed among the revolutionary masses, and further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the small island fishing village have a deep understanding of the great significance of this Cultural Revolution. They sing, “The thunder of the Cultural Revolution roars, people and land are new and in red attire; the poor and lower-middle peasants are united, firmly holding the helm to defend the coast; our red hearts forever turn to Chairman Mao, never forgetting the teachings of the great leader!”

    毛泽东思想照亮了小岛渔村
    海军某部安业民生前所在连五好战士　许忠杰
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近英明地指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”学习毛主席的这一光辉指示，使我越来越深刻地认识到这次无产阶级文化大革命伟大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践告诉我们：如果不是毛主席亲自发动和领导这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，把埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他在各地的代理人挖出来，我国的无产阶级专政就不能巩固，我们的国家就要改变颜色，资本主义就会在我国复辟，我们就要受二遍苦，遭二茬罪。
    我参加支左的地方是辽宁省海洋岛南部的错渔石生产队。这个离祖国大陆几百里，居住着二十九户人家的小渔村，既是海防前哨，也是阶级斗争的前哨。帝国主义和国民党反动派，经常派遣特务到这里，企图潜伏下来，使这个地方成为他们进行侵略和颠覆的跳板。而大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，则通过他在这个地方的代理人竭力推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义黑货，企图复辟资本主义。由于帝国主义、国民党反动派和刘少奇内外配合，相互勾结，在一个时期内，这个小渔村的贫下中农，看不见毛主席他老人家的像，听不到毛主席他老人家的教导，读不到毛主席他老人家的书；资本主义自发势力抬头，两极分化日趋严重。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，打倒了大叛徒刘少奇，这个小岛也揪出了埋藏的一小撮坏人，群众觉悟大大提高。毛主席的一系列最新指示，把远离祖国大陆的小岛渔村照得通亮。现在，这个小渔村里，家家挂起了毛主席像，户户升起红太阳，毛泽东思想大普及，学习班办到了炕头上。广大贫下中农，以毛主席最新指示为武器，以刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义谬论作靶子，结合本村阶级斗争的现实，深入展开了革命大批判。大家认识到：刘少奇的“三自一包”是“毒药蘸了糖，甜了嘴，断了肠。”在毛主席“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”的最新指示指引下，这个生产队进行了清理阶级队伍的工作，把混在革命群众中的坏人揪了出来，使无产阶级专政进一步得到巩固。
    小岛渔村的贫下中农，对这场文化大革命的伟大意义有很深的体会，人人称赞文化大革命搞得对，搞得好，搞得及时！他们编歌唱道：“文化大革命春雷响，人新地新换红装；贫下中农一条心，握紧印把守海防；红心永向毛主席，伟大领袖的教导永不忘！”
