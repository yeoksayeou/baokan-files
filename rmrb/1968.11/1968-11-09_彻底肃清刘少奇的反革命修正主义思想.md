The expanded 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party announced the expulsion of Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist roader, from the Party permanently, stripping him of all his Party and government positions, and continuing to settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for their crimes of betraying the Party and the country. It also aims to eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the like, the biggest group of capitalist roaders within the Party. This completely expresses our feelings. We, the working class, support it a thousand times, ten thousand times!

Our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin understand our feelings as workers the best, reflect our demands as workers the best, and represent our interests as workers the best. We have long hated this old counter-revolutionary, Liu Shaoqi!

It was this guy who repeatedly betrayed the Party, betrayed the working class, and begged the Kuomintang reactionaries for mercy. He is a butcher with blood on his hands.

It was this guy who advocated selling out the country, recognizing the enemy as his father, willingly becoming a slave of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and openly publishing articles in newspapers to thank American imperialism for its so-called "help" to China.

It was this guy who fiercely opposed Chairman Mao, opposed the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. He collaborated with all the reactionaries in the world to sing anti-China songs, desperately peddling revisionist goods, and winning the favor of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

This guy is a loyal running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, with countless crimes!

Under the cover of the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," a small group of remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries infiltrated our working class ranks, implementing a set of counter-revolutionary enterprise management lines of control, restriction, deduction, and punishment in the factories. They promoted material incentives and money worship, trying to make us workers sleep in the money pit, abandoning the struggle against them. In our factory, there are more than twenty kinds of bonuses alone. The result is that the overproduction bonus is often not completed, the safety bonus often has accidents, the full-attendance bonus often has people not coming to work, and the new product trial production bonus does not produce new products. Now there are no bonuses, which is due to the fact that the proletarian revolutionaries have taken power, insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, with high attendance rates, fewer accidents, and production rising month by month. New products are continuously successfully tested. Isn't this the most powerful blow to Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices?

In the old society, we workers were exploited and oppressed, working like cattle and horses, eating like pigs and dogs. Today, we have become the masters of the state. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. However, the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi wants to restore capitalism, wants us to hand over power, and wants us to suffer twice the hardship and twice the bitterness. If we do not thoroughly criticize and denounce this guy, we will not be able to resolve our deep-seated hatred.

The plenary session calls on all Party members and the people of the whole country to continue to deeply develop the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, thoroughly eliminating the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the like, the biggest group of capitalist roaders within the Party. This is the fundamental measure to thoroughly defeat Liu Shaoqi, permanently defeat Liu Shaoqi, and ensure that we do not change our nature, the Party does not change its color, and the country does not change its color. We firmly respond!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class enemy will definitely look for opportunities to show themselves. They are not willing to accept the fate of national destruction and communism." Although Liu Shaoqi has been overthrown, the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts he spread have not been thoroughly eliminated, and they still stink like a vat of rotten pulp. If we do not carry out the revolutionary criticism and denunciation to the end, Liu Shaoqi's corpse will still crawl out of the coffin; even if he does not crawl out, he will still borrow a corpse to return to life, and there will be another Zhang Shaoqi, Li Shaoqi, just like Liu Shaoqi and his agents, acting as running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, trying to make us suffer again. We, the working class, will not allow it! All our class brothers and sisters will not allow it! We will hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for their crimes of betraying the Party and the country, thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the like, the biggest group of capitalist roaders within the Party, and thoroughly defeat Liu Shaoqi!

To hit the target, you must hit the heart. We must repeatedly and deeply criticize Liu Shaoqi's betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat and his attempt to restore capitalism. To uproot a tree, you must uproot its roots. We must closely combine the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism. Once selfishness is thoroughly driven away, Liu Shaoqi will never be able to revive.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: The working class must lead everything. To ensure the leading position of the working class, we must thoroughly criticize and denounce Liu Shaoqi, this sworn enemy of the working class. Liu Shaoqi, listen: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the working class, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to expose you, and politically sentenced you to death. This is not just for a day or two, nor is it for ten or eight years. We will use the weapon of revolutionary criticism and denunciation to sentence you to never be able to rise again for thousands of generations!

Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi!

### 彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想

    彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会宣布把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，完全说出了我们的心里话，我们工人阶级一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部最了解我们工人阶级的心情，最能反映我们工人阶级的要求，最能代表我们工人阶级的利益。我们早就恨透了刘少奇这个老反革命！
    就是这个家伙，多次变节自首，出卖党、出卖工人阶级，向国民党反动派乞求饶恕他的狗命。他是一个双手沾满了革命人民鲜血的刽子手。
    就是这个家伙，大肆宣扬卖国主义，认贼作父，心甘情愿地去当帝国主义和国民党反动派的奴才，公开在报纸上发表文章，感谢美帝国主义对中国的所谓“帮助”。
    就是这个家伙，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对以毛主席为首的党中央，反对无产阶级专政。他配合世界上一切反动派进行反华大合唱，拚命地贩卖修正主义黑货，讨得了帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的喜欢。
    这个家伙是帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，罪恶累累！
    在叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”这个大黑伞的遮盖下，一小撮国民党反动派的残渣余孽混入了我们工人阶级队伍内部，在工厂里实行一整套管、卡、扣、罚的反革命企业管理路线，大搞物质刺激、金钱挂帅，妄图让我们工人钻在钱眼子里睡大觉，放弃对他们的斗争。在我们厂，光奖金就有二十多种。结果是发超产奖经常完不成任务，发安全奖经常出事故，发全勤奖经常有人不上班，发新产品试制奖不出新产品。现在啥奖也没有，就是由于我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，出勤率高，事故少，生产月月上升，新产品不断试制成功。这不是对刘少奇及其同伙的最有力的打击吗？
    在旧社会，我们工人阶级受剥削，受压迫，出的牛马力，吃的猪狗食。今天，我们成了国家的主人。我们要永远紧跟毛主席干革命。但是，刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，却要复辟资本主义，要我们交权，要我们吃二遍苦、受二茬罪。不把这个家伙批倒批臭，解不了我们心头之恨。
    全会号召全党同志和全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想。这是彻底打倒刘少奇，永远打倒刘少奇，保证我们人不变质，党不变修，国不变色的根本措施。我们坚决响应！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。”刘少奇虽然被打倒了，但他所散布的那一套反革命修正主义思想，还没有彻底肃清，还象一缸烂纸浆一样散发着臭气。如果我们不把革命大批判进行到底，刘少奇这具死尸还会从棺材里爬起来；就是他不爬起来，他还会借尸还魂，再出张少奇、李少奇，象刘少奇及其代理人一样充当帝、修、反的走狗，妄图让我们再受二茬罪。我们工人阶级决不答应！我们所有的阶级兄弟姊妹都不答应！我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判的旗帜，继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想，彻底打倒刘少奇！
    打靶要打心。必须抓住刘少奇背叛无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的要害问题，反复地批，深刻地批。刨树要刨根。必须把斗私和批修密切结合起来。私是修根，“私”字彻底赶跑了，刘少奇就再也复活不了了。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：工人阶级必须领导一切。要保证工人阶级的领导地位，就必须把刘少奇这个工人阶级的死对头彻底批倒、批臭。刘少奇你听着：我们工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署把你揪出来了，政治上判了你的死刑，可不是只判你一朝一夕，也不是十年八年，我们要用革命大批判的武器判你千年万代不得翻身！
    打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！
