The people of Albania are welcoming their great national day—the 24th anniversary of National Liberation (November 29) and the 56th anniversary of Independence (November 28)—with high revolutionary enthusiasm and brilliant production achievements. On the eve of the festival, reports of construction victories are pouring in from every corner of the Eagle Country like snowflakes.

This year, Albania's national industrial production value is expected to reach 101% of the plan, an increase of 17% over 1967.

Tirana, which accounts for more than 20% of the national industrial production value, has several dozen factories and enterprises that have either completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule or exceeded the production plan for the first eleven months. In Tirana, 39 factories and enterprises have already reached the production level of 1970, the last year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Following the initiative of a production team in the First Spinning Factory of the Stalin Textile Combine, which proposed "marching ahead of time and achieving the 1970 production target in 1968," the entire factory now has 1,400 workers who have reached the 1970 production level. In the wool mill of the combine, 200 workers are already executing the 1971 production tasks.

To strongly support agricultural production, the workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory, under the slogan of strengthening class education, producing high-quality products, and increasing varieties, have already implemented the 1970 plan to expand varieties and have doubled the factory's production since the beginning of the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1966.

The workers of the electrical pole factory of the Tirana Joseph Pashko Building Materials Combine have guaranteed to complete the entire production task of the Fourth Five-Year Plan by the 24th anniversary of National Liberation, thus strongly supporting the country's basic construction and rural electrification work. The Tirana Brick and Tile Factory reduced its production cost by 9% in the first nine months of this year compared to the original plan.

The workers of the Elbasan District have produced products worth 10 million leks (Albanian currency) above the plan in the first ten months of this year, proposed more than 1,800 rationalization suggestions, built 37 new workshops and production lines, and produced 84 new products.

The workers of the Fier District have produced products worth 10.41 million leks above the plan in the first ten months of this year, proposed more than 1,900 rationalization suggestions, and built many new production lines and machinery.

The workers of the largest hydroelectric power station in the country, the Vau i Dejës Hydroelectric Power Station, are working hard to welcome the festival. Many production teams are completing the production quota by 50% more each day. While accelerating construction, they also pay attention to saving resources. In the first nine months of this year, they saved the country 4 million leks worth of explosives, building materials, and other resources.

The workers of the Djega Copper Mine in Kukës District and the Bulqizë Chromium Mine in Peshkopi District are fighting bravely against storms and severe cold in the high mountains, completing the production plan for the first eleven months ahead of schedule.

The Sapot Woodworking Factory in Librazhd District completed this year's annual plan two months ahead of schedule.

Agricultural workers are also presenting outstanding production achievements to the festival. Despite unfavorable climate conditions for agricultural production this year, the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members and state farm workers have displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm and labor fervor, taken various measures, overcome many difficulties, and still achieved a good harvest. The unit area yield of grain crops in many regions across the country has been correspondingly increased.

It is estimated that this year's grain production will increase by 65% over the last year of the previous five-year plan—1965. Agricultural cooperatives across the country have completed the grain delivery plan 65 days ahead of schedule. In the first ten months of this year, the amount of grain purchased by the state has increased by more than 29% compared to the same period last year.

The peasants are also welcoming the festival with the achievements of exceeding the land reclamation plan by 22% and continuing large-scale water conservancy projects.

    今年全国工业生产总值将比一九六七年增长百分之十七
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民正以高涨的革命热情和辉煌的生产成就迎接自己的伟大节日——祖国解放二十四周年（十一月二十九日）和独立五十六周年（十一月二十八日）。节日前夕，生产建设的捷报象雪片一样从山鹰之国的各个角落纷纷传来。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚全国工业生产总值预计将完成百分之一百零一，比一九六七年增长百分之十七。
    占全国工业生产总产值百分之二十以上的地拉那市已有几十家工厂企业提前完成了今年的生产计划或超额完成前十一个月的生产计划。地拉那市还有三十九个工厂企业已经达到了一九七○年——第四个五年计划最后一年的生产水平。在斯大林纺织联合工厂第一纺纱厂一个生产队提出的“走在时间的前面，在一九六八年就达到一九七○年的生产指标”的倡议的带动下，现在全厂已有一千四百名工人达到了一九七○年的生产水平，而在联合工厂的毛纺厂里，已有二百名工人在执行一九七一年的生产任务了。
    为了大力支援农业生产，地拉那拖拉机配件厂的职工在加强阶级教育、努力生产优质产品和增加品种的口号下，已经实现了一九七○年扩大品种的计划，并从一九六六年第四个五年计划开始以来已经使全厂的生产扩大了一倍。
    地拉那约瑟夫·帕希科建筑材料联合工厂的电线杆厂的工人保证到祖国解放二十四周年的节日时，就完成第四个五年计划的全部生产任务，以大力支援国家的基本建设和农村的电气化工作。地拉那砖瓦厂今年头九个月的生产成本比原计划降低了百分之九。
    爱尔巴桑区全区职工在今年头十个月内超计划生产了价值一千万列克（阿币名）的产品，提出了一千八百多项合理化建议，新建了三十七个车间和作业线，生产了八十四种新产品。
    发罗拉区职工今年头十个月来超计划生产价值一千零四十一万列克的产品，提出一千九百多项合理化建议，新建了许多新的作业线和制成一些新的机器设备。
    正在建设中的全国最大的水电站沃德耶水电站全体职工正在辛勤劳动，迎接节日，不少生产队每天超额百分之五十完成生产定额。他们在加速建设的同时，还注意节约，今年头九个月，他们为国家节约了价值四百万列克的炸药、建筑材料等物资。
    库克斯区杰吉安铜矿和佩什科比区布尔奇泽铬矿的工人在野外高山，同暴风雨和严寒展开英勇的搏斗，提前完成了头十一个月的生产计划。
    利布拉什德区萨波特锯木厂提前两个月完成今年全年计划。
    农业劳动者也以出色的生产成就向节日献礼。尽管今年的气候条件对农业生产不利，但广大农业生产合作社社员和国营农场工人发扬高度革命干劲和劳动热情，采取了各种措施，克服了许多困难，仍然夺得了粮食生产的好收成。全国许多地区粮食作物的单位面积产量都得到了相应的提高。
    预计今年的谷物产量将比上一个五年计划最后一年——一九六五年增长百分之六十五。全国农业合作社提前六十五天完成了粮食交售计划。在今年头十个月中，国家收购的粮食数量比去年同期增加了百分之二十九以上。
    农民们还以超额完成开垦荒地计划百分之二十二和继续进行大规模兴修水利的成绩迎接节日。
