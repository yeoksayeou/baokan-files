The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xielou Commune in Lingshi County, Anhui Province, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, launched a magnificent educational revolution during this year's Spring Festival, seizing the educational power from the bourgeois intellectuals. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao has given us poor and lower-middle peasants support. We poor and lower-middle peasants must make Chairman Mao proud and must manage the schools well.

How should the poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools? In our view, they should focus on managing four key areas.

Firstly, the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage the schools by holding onto the "power." They must ensure that the educational power remains firmly in their hands for generations to come. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power." Revolution is about seizing power. During the land reform, we poor and lower-middle peasants established schools, and they flourished. Later, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents seized the power. These scoundrels followed the bourgeois line, strangling us poor and lower-middle peasants with their rules about scores, tuition fees, and age limits, keeping our children out of schools or forcing them out. They, however, pampered the children of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In Daxie Brigade, out of 14 high school and junior high school graduates, only two were from poor and lower-middle peasant families. A landlord's son once said to his father, "The poor and lower-middle peasants took away our five major assets, but they can't take away the knowledge in our stomachs." We poor and lower-middle peasants were so angry we could burst! We must learn from this lesson. This time, Chairman Mao has called on us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools, and we must never forget this "power."

Secondly, the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage the schools by being "loyal" to the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our savior, the brightest red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools means implementing Chairman Mao's educational revolution line, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Whatever aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, we support; whatever goes against it, we oppose. In the old schools, a handful of bad elements would poison the students as soon as they started teaching, telling them to "listen to the teachers at school and parents at home," but not to listen to Chairman Mao; they taught them to "be polite and tolerant to others," but didn't specify which class they should be polite to. Or they taught nonsense like "cat jumping, dog barking," and the books were full of flowers, birds, mansions, parks, and roads. This isn't about teaching methods; it's class struggle! Why don't they teach the children to love the great leader Chairman Mao? Why don't they teach the children to learn Mao Zedong Thought? Because if the children master Mao Zedong Thought, they can't carry out capitalist restoration! So, we poor and lower-middle peasants must ensure that the schools become red classrooms of Mao Zedong Thought, making sure that what we teach, discuss, and use is Mao Zedong Thought. This way, our descendants will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Thirdly, the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage the schools by ensuring the revolutionization of teachers. Chairman Mao said, "The key to educational reform is the teachers." This is absolutely true! If teachers are full of selfishness, how can they produce good students? For the original teachers, if they are traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, or counter-revolutionaries, they must all be expelled. This is a crucial check. Most teachers were educated in the bourgeois way, detached from proletarian politics, production practice, and the worker-peasant masses, with old-fashioned thinking. They must be re-educated. As long as they are willing to revolutionize, we poor and lower-middle peasants will unite with them and re-educate them. After our commune's poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the schools, we organized them to step out of the school gates, learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought with us poor and lower-middle peasants, hold lectures and struggle sessions together, and participate in labor together. If any of them refuse our re-education, we cannot let them teach, and they have no right to educate our poor and lower-middle peasants' children. This is not enough; we must also select some poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to be teachers. Our commune carefully selected over a hundred people to form nine lecture teams to regularly teach the students. What do they teach? They teach about Chairman Mao's greatness, their experiences in learning Mao Zedong Thought, class struggle, and production knowledge. A poor peasant from Dongbei Loulou Brigade, Zhang Zhao Fa's mother, brought her begging basket and ladle from the old society to the classroom, recounting the blood and tears of the old society to the students, who were all moved to tears, repeatedly shouting, "Down with the landlord class!" When Zhang's mother talked about today's happy life, the students again shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" This is something the old teachers could never do.

Fourthly, the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage the schools by cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. What is the purpose of running schools? It is to cultivate "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers." We poor and lower-middle peasants do not need officials who lord over us, nor do we want revisionist seeds. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we not only need the correct line and policy but also need to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." The old schools did not talk about this; they kept talking about "standardization" and "educational quality," which is sheer nonsense. They kept the students in schools, made them sit at desks, and buried them in books, thinking only about "reading to become officials," "academics first," and "grades first," with no thought of "revolution." In the past, some of our poor and lower-middle peasants' children, after graduating from junior high school, returned home, finding everything unsatisfactory, unable to get along with us poor and lower-middle peasants, and unwilling to sit with us. A production team couldn't find a suitable accountant, so they asked a junior high school graduate from the old school, "Will you be the accountant?" He said, "I won't do it. Being an accountant in the countryside is not as good as being a temporary worker in the city!" We poor and lower-middle peasants were truly heartbroken. This is not our good young man! The revisionist educational system is a disaster. The schools managed by us poor and lower-middle peasants have become revolutionary furnaces; the people they cultivate are all in one heart with us poor and lower-middle peasants, saying what we say, doing what we do, able to farm with a hoe, criticize the bourgeoisie with a pen, and defend socialism with a gun, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying the proletarian revolutionary cause to the end.

    贫下中农管理学校要管好四件大事
    安徽省灵璧县谢楼公社贫农社员　贫下中农管理学校领导小组副组长　李志银
    我们谢楼公社贫下中农，怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，今年春节开展了轰轰烈烈的教育革命，从资产阶级知识分子手中夺回了教育大权。毛主席最近指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席他老人家给俺贫下中农撑了腰，俺贫下中农一定要为毛主席争气，一定要管理好学校。
    贫下中农怎样管理学校？照我们看，要管好四件大事。
    贫下中农管理学校，首先要管在“权”字上，要世世代代把教育大权牢牢掌握在自己手里。毛主席教导我们：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”革命就是夺权。土改那时候，俺贫下中农办起了学校，办得轰轰烈烈。后来大叛徒刘少奇和他的代理人，把权夺去了。这些家伙搞资产阶级那一套，卡我们贫下中农的脖子，用什么分数关、学费关、年龄关，把俺们贫下中农的子弟挡在校门外，或者硬赶出学校门；对地、富、反、坏、右的子女却是百般照顾。大谢大队共有高、初中毕业生十四人，贫下中农子女只有两人。有个地主分子对他的儿子说：“贫下中农把我家的五大财产分了，书念到肚子里他们总分不掉。”我们贫下中农听了，肺都气炸了！这个教训我们贫下中农一定要吸取。这回毛主席叫俺贫下中农管理学校，我们千万不要忘记这个“权”字。
    贫下中农管理学校，要管在对伟大领袖毛主席的“忠”字上。毛主席是俺贫下中农的救命恩人，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是俺们的命根子。俺贫下中农管理学校，就是要贯彻毛主席的教育革命路线，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，符合毛泽东思想的我们就干，违反毛泽东思想的我们就反对。旧学校那一小撮坏家伙，一上课就放毒，光教学生“在校听老师的话，在家听父母的话”，就是不让学生听毛主席的话；光教“对人有礼貌，互相忍让”，而不讲是对那个阶级的人。要么，就教些什么猫儿跳、狗儿叫呀，书上印的尽是些花呀，鸟呀，大洋楼呀，大公园呀，大马路呀。这哪是什么教书方法问题？这就是阶级斗争！他们为啥不教育孩子热爱伟大领袖毛主席？为啥不教育孩子学习毛泽东思想？因为孩子们掌握了毛泽东思想，他们就没法子搞资本主义复辟啦！所以俺贫下中农要想不受二遍苦，就得把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大课堂，要做到学的是毛泽东思想，讲的是毛泽东思想，用的是毛泽东思想，使俺们贫下中农的子子孙孙，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    贫下中农管理学校，要管在教师的革命化上。毛主席说：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”真是千真万确！教师满脑子“私”字，咋能带出好学生？对原来的教师，如果是混进来的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命分子，就统统清扫出去。这个关一定要把好。大多数教师从前受的是资产阶级教育，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产实践，脱离工农群众，思想还是旧的，必须对他们进行再教育。只要他们愿意革命，俺贫下中农就团结他们，对他们进行再教育。俺公社贫下中农管理学校后，就组织他们跨出学校门，同贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起开讲用会，一起斗私批修，一起参加劳动。如果他们当中，有的不接受俺们贫下中农的再教育，俺们就不能要他当老师，他也没有资格教育俺贫下中农的孩子。光做这些事还不行，还要选些贫下中农、革命干部来当老师。俺公社挑了又挑，选了又选，挑选一百多人组成九个讲师团，定时给学生讲课。讲什么？讲毛主席伟大，讲学习毛泽东思想的体会，讲阶级斗争，讲生产知识。东北娄大队贫农社员张召法的母亲，把在旧社会要饭的篮子和瓢带到课堂上，向学生控诉旧社会的血泪仇，学生都感动得流了泪，不断高呼：“打倒地主阶级！”张老大娘讲到今天幸福生活的时候，学生们又不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”这是过去的教师根本办不到的。
    贫下中农管理学校，要管在培养无产阶级革命事业接班人上。办学校是干什么的？就是要培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。我们贫下中农不需要骑在我们头上的官老爷，不希罕修正主义的苗子。毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”旧学校就不谈这个，口口声声谈啥“正规化”、“教育质量”，简直是瞎胡扯。他们把学生圈在学校里，按在课桌上，拉进书本中，整天想的是“读书做官”，“智育第一”，“分数挂帅”，心里哪里还有“革命”两个字？过去，我们有的贫下中农的子女初中毕业回到家里，这也看不惯，那也不如意，和贫下中农拉不到一块，坐不到一起。有个生产队找不到一个合适的会计，就问从旧学校出来的中学生：“你当会计吧！”他说：“我不干，在农村当会计还不如到城里干个合同工好！”俺贫下中农看了真痛心，这哪是俺贫下中农的好后生！修正主义教育制度就是祸害人。俺贫下中农管理的学校，一所所学校都成为革命的大熔炉；培养的人，个个都和俺们贫下中农一个心眼，说的是俺们要说的话，干的是俺们要干的事，拿起锄头会种地，拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级，拿起枪杆能保卫社会主义，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级革命事业干到底。
