New China News Agency, November 22: Tokyo - The leader of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement in Chiba Prefecture, Tamura Ichisaku, recently published an article in the "Shakai Shinpo" newspaper. In it, he pointed out that the Miyamoto revisionist group in the Japanese Communist Party has taken reactionary actions in Sanrizuka, directing their attacks at the farmers' organization "Anti-Airport Alliance," which is engaged in anti-American struggles. This has played a very sinister and destructive role.

Tamura wrote that during the October elections for the mayor and council members of Narita City in Chiba Prefecture, the Miyamoto group maliciously slandered and defamed the Sanrizuka farmers' anti-American struggle, fully exposing their reactionary nature.

Tamura wrote that in the struggle of the Japanese people against the reactionary U.S.-Japan forces to build the "New Tokyo International Airport," the Miyamoto group advocated gathering a force that "everyone would happily join," and then using the construction of a "Peace Tower" to "stop" the construction of the "international airport." This group demanded that the farmers of Iwamurayama Village raise funds and send labor during the busy farming season to build the Peace Tower, draining the farmers' strength. The Miyamoto group also attempted to spread the illusion among the farmers that victory could be achieved without struggle, thereby weakening the farmers' fighting spirit. Tamura pointed out that this is consistent with the Miyamoto group's advocacy for establishing a "democratic government" through parliament and then using a "notice" to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Tamura pointed out that these actions by the Miyamoto group have committed heinous crimes against the farmers of Iwamurayama Village. They have used methods to weaken the farmers' fighting spirit, aiding the ruling class.

Tamura finally wrote that the Sanrizuka farmers, in order to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and prevent the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport," are fighting selflessly. No matter how the enemy suppresses them, they will continue this struggle until the final victory.

    日本三里塚农民运动领导人谴责宫本集团的叛卖行径
    宫本集团破坏农民反美斗争犯下滔天罪行
    新华社二十二日讯  东京消息：日本千叶县三里塚农民运动领导人户村一作最近在《社会新报》上发表文章指出，日共宫本修正主义集团在三里塚的言行是反动的，它把矛头指向正在进行反美斗争的农民组织“反对同盟”，起着非常阴险的破坏作用。
    户村写道，宫本集团在今年十月间举行的千叶县成田市市长和议员的竞选中，大肆诽谤和诬蔑三里塚农民的反美斗争，充分暴露了它的反动嘴脸。
    户村写道，宫本集团在日本人民反对美日反动派修建“新东京国际机场”的斗争中，鼓吹要集结一支“谁都愉快地愿意参加”的力量，然后用修建和平塔的办法“阻止”修建“国际机场”。这个集团要求岩山村的农民在农忙季节为它募款、派工去修建和平塔，消耗农民的力量。宫本集团还企图通过修建和平塔以便在农民中散布不需要斗争就可以取胜的幻想，涣散农民的斗志。户村指出，这同宫本集团主张通过议会建立“民主政府”，然后用一纸“通知”来废除日美“安全条约”，是一个道理。
    户村指出，宫本集团的这些行径，对岩山村的农民犯下了滔天罪行。它用涣散农民斗志的手法，帮助了统治阶级。
    户村最后写道，三里塚农民为了粉碎日美“安全条约”，阻止修建“新东京国际机场”，正在奋不顾身地进行斗争。不管敌人怎样镇压，他们都要把这场斗争进行到最后胜利。
