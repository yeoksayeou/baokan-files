In the Albanian film *Wide Horizons*, the hero Uran, after rushing from his home to the port and injuring his leg while rescuing a floating crane, firmly replies to the captain and comrades who urge him to rest in the cabin: "I can endure it, don't mind me!"

"Don't mind me!" What a resounding and powerful declaration! What a sublime spiritual realm!

Throughout the film, Uran's spirit of "don't mind me" shines brightly. When Azem unfortunately falls into the sea and is in grave danger, it is the spirit of "don't mind me" that drives Uran to jump into the icy sea to rescue his comrade; when the floating crane encounters problems while pulling the concrete pier, it is the spirit of "don't mind me" that inspires Uran to dive into the cold sea without hesitation and hook the steel cable to the bottom of the concrete pier; when the crane pulley is damaged, it is again the spirit of "don't mind me" that prompts Uran to get up in the middle of the night, brave the biting cold, and climb the crane to repair it; when a storm approaches, it is still the spirit of "don't mind me" that leads Uran to forgo his rest time, rush to the port to rescue the floating crane, and ultimately sacrifice his life gloriously.

"Don't mind me!" This is the embodiment of the proletarian worldview of selflessness. Uran, this great communist warrior, has every cell of his body permeated with the spirit of "public"; every nerve of his is directed by the spirit of "public"; every action of his is guided by the spirit of "public." He is selfless, dedicated to the public cause, and lives for the public cause.

Uran's spirit of "don't mind me" is the result of being nurtured by the great Marxist-Leninist thought. Uran became a selfless and fearless hero of "don't mind me" precisely because he always remembered Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings and armed himself with Marxist-Leninist ideology.

We must learn from Uran's spirit of "don't mind me!"

    赞“别管我”
    南京部队某部　红天兵
    阿尔巴尼亚故事片《广阔的地平线》中的英雄乌拉恩，当他从家里赶来港口，因为抢救浮吊腿部负伤后，船长和同志们都劝他回船舱里休息，他斩钉截铁地回答：“我能坚持，别管我！”
    “别管我！”这是多么铿锵有力的豪言壮语，这是多么崇高的精神境界！
    影片从头到尾，都闪耀着乌拉恩“别管我”的思想光辉。当阿兹姆不幸落海，生命垂危的紧要关头，是“别管我”的精神，使乌拉恩毅然跳进刺骨的海水里抢救同志；当浮吊拔水泥桥桩发生问题时，是“别管我”的精神，激励乌拉恩毫不犹豫地潜入冰冷的海水中，把钢缆挂在水泥桥桩的下部；当吊车滑轮损坏时，又是“别管我”的精神，指使乌拉恩半夜起床，冒着凛冽的寒风，爬上吊杆进行检修；当暴风雨来临时，还是“别管我”的精神，使乌拉恩主动放弃休息时间，赶到港口抢救浮吊，并光荣地献出了自己的生命。
    “别管我！”这是工人阶级一心为公的世界观的表现。乌拉恩，这个伟大的共产主义战士，他的每一个细胞，都被“公”字所渗透；他的每一根神经，都受“公”字所指挥；他的每一个行动，都是沿着“公”字的轨道办事的。他一心为公，一切为公，一生为公。
    乌拉恩的“别管我”精神，是伟大的马克思列宁主义思想哺育的结果。乌拉恩之所以能成为“别管我”的无私无畏的英雄，就是因为他时刻牢记着霍查同志的教导，用马克思列宁主义武装了自己的头脑。
    我们要学习乌拉恩的“别管我”精神！
