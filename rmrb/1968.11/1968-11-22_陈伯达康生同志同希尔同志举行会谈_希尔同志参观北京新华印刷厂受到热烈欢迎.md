	Chen Boda and Kang Sheng, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, held talks with E.F. Hill, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), in Beijing today.

	The talks were held in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere.

	E.F. Hill, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), visited and toured the Beijing New China Printing Factory this morning, accompanied by Wu De, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

	More than 1,200 revolutionary workers of the New China Printing Factory held high the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and shouted slogans such as "Workers of the world, unite!" to warmly welcome Comrade Hill.

	Comrade Hill listened to the introduction by the responsible members of the factory revolutionary committee about the revolutionary workers of the entire factory studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, closely following the great strategic deployments of our great leader Chairman Mao, seizing the revolution and promoting production, and firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly striking a small handful of class enemies. He also toured the flat printing, intaglio printing, letterpress printing, rotary printing, and binding workshops where the revolutionary classics and portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao are printed.

	The Revolutionary Committee of the New China Printing Factory held a revolutionary workers' meeting in the rotary printing workshop to welcome Comrade Hill.

	Wang Lianzhang, Deputy Chairman of the factory revolutionary committee, on behalf of all the revolutionary workers of the factory, warmly welcomed Comrade Hill, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), who is high-holding the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. He said, our factory's revolutionary workers resolutely support and implement the communiqué and resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of our Party, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, seize the revolution and promote production with the highest political enthusiasm, the greatest revolutionary spirit, and the highest quality, print well the red classics and brilliant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and support with practical actions the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

	Comrade Hill spoke in the midst of warm applause. He said, the historically significant resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have reviewed the truly world-shaking experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These experiences are of great significance to China; they are also of great significance to the working class and oppressed peoples of the whole world. The imperialists led by American imperialism, the revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique, and all other reactionaries have placed great hopes on Liu Shaoqi and his band of miserable scoundrels. Exposing Liu Shaoqi and passing a resolution to expel him from the Party permanently and remove all his posts is a smashing blow to them, a great contribution to the world revolutionary movement.

	Comrade Hill said, the experiences you have gained in the storm of the cultural revolution have made you and the working people of the world together spiritually invigorated and obtained new strength. It has brought a new and higher stage of Marxism-Leninism, namely Mao Zedong Thought, to millions of people, thus generating material force. This revolution, which has been successfully carried out under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, has greatly strengthened the power of China and also greatly strengthened the power of the world revolutionary movement.

	Comrade Hill stressed, all these great victories have been achieved under the leadership of your great, glorious, and correct Party, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought and under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao. Strictly adhering to Chairman Mao's thoughts and guidance is the guarantee of your victory, the guarantee of our victory, and the guarantee of the victory of the world socialist revolution.

	Finally, Comrade Hill shouted, "Long live proletarian internationalism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    陈伯达康生同志同希尔同志举行会谈
    希尔同志参观北京新华印刷厂受到热烈欢迎
    希尔同志在参观时讲话说，中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的具有历史意义的决议，检阅了无产阶级文化大革命的真正地震撼世界的经验。这些经验对中国具有重大意义；对全世界的工人阶级和被压迫人民也具有重大的意义
    新华社二十一日讯　中共中央政治局常委陈伯达、康生同志，同澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席爱·弗·希尔同志，今天在北京举行会谈。
    会谈在极其亲切、友好的气氛中进行。
    新华社二十一日讯　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席爱·弗·希尔同志，今天上午由北京市革命委员会副主任吴德同志陪同，参观访问了北京新华印刷厂。
    新华印刷厂一千二百多名革命职工，高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高呼“全世界无产者联合起来”等口号，热烈欢迎希尔同志。
    希尔同志听取了工厂革命委员会负责成员介绍全厂革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，抓革命、促生产的情况，和稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的情况，参观了印制伟大领袖毛主席的革命宝书的平印、凹印、铅印、轮转、装订等车间。
    新华印刷厂革命委员会在轮转车间举行革命职工大会，欢迎希尔同志。
    工厂革委会副主任王连章同志代表全厂革命职工，热烈欢迎高举马克思列宁主义和反帝反修斗争旗帜的澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔同志。他说，我厂全体革命职工坚决拥护和执行我们党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报和决议，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以最高的政治热情，最大的革命干劲，最高的质量，印好我们伟大领袖毛主席的红宝书和光辉像片，以实际行动支持世界各国人民反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命斗争。
    希尔同志在热烈的掌声中发表讲话。他说，中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的具有历史意义的决议，检阅了无产阶级文化大革命的真正地震撼世界的经验。这些经验对中国具有重大意义；对全世界的工人阶级和被压迫人民也具有重大的意义。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者、以苏修集团为首的修正主义者和其他一切反动派，都把很大的希望寄托在刘少奇和他的一帮可悲的坏蛋们身上。把刘少奇揭露出来，并且通过决议把他永远开除出党和撤消他的一切职务，这是对他们的一次粉碎性的打击，这是对世界革命运动的一个重大贡献。
    希尔同志说，你们在文化革命风暴中取得的经验，使你们也使同你们一起的全世界劳动人民精神振奋，并且得到了新的力量。它把一个崭新的更高的阶段中的马克思列宁主义，即毛泽东思想，带给千百万人民，从而产生出物质力量。这场在无产阶级专政条件下胜利进行的革命，极大地增强了中国的力量，也极大地增强了世界革命运动的力量。
    希尔同志强调说，所有这一切伟大的胜利，都是在你们伟大的、光荣的、正确的党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的鼓舞和在毛主席的亲自指引下取得的。严格遵循毛主席的思想和指导，这是你们取得胜利的保证，是我们取得胜利的保证，是世界社会主义革命取得胜利的保证。
    最后，希尔同志高呼：“无产阶级国际主义万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
