The plenary session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally chaired by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, is a meeting of great historical significance. We firmly support all the resolutions made at this plenary session.

Over the past two years, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of our country, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have, through fierce and repeated class struggles, broken through numerous obstacles and finally smashed the bourgeois headquarters, represented by Liu Shaoqi, that attempted to usurp the Party, the government, and the army. They have exposed his agents in various places and achieved a great, decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The publication of the plenary session's communiqué declares the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi's gang's attempt to restore capitalism in China.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and should not seek fame like Xiang Yu." While celebrating our victory, we must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, carry the revolution through to the end. The plenary session's communiqué is the compass for us to carry the revolution through to the end. We must study it seriously, understand it deeply, and implement it resolutely.

The revolution will continue to deepen, and the focus of class struggle remains the issue of power. Many of our Party members and cadres have joined the new revolutionary government, which is the trust of the Party and the working people in us. How to wield power and use it well? This is a very serious question before us, which must be answered with practical actions.

To wield power and use it well, the most fundamental thing is to let Mao Zedong Thought guide one's soul and direct one's actions. One must master Mao Zedong Thought, internalize it, and put it into practice. One must use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to constantly criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideas, constantly cleanse one's soul of non-proletarian thoughts, and constantly transform one's worldview. Without destroying the old, one cannot establish the new. Without overcoming bourgeois ideas in one's mind, one cannot establish Mao Zedong Thought. A proletarian party must "expel the old to take in the new" to remain vigorous; a revolutionary cadre can only master Mao Zedong Thought by constantly and consciously "expelling the old to take in the new" in one's thoughts, can only wield power with party spirit, and can only remain revolutionary. A genuine proletarian revolutionary leadership must, in the class struggle, constantly "expel the old to take in the new" in one's thoughts, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and wield and use power with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental principle.

To wield power and use it well, one must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and maintain close ties with the masses. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, and the revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao the most. Believing in the masses or despising them, maintaining ties with the masses or alienating them, protecting the masses or suppressing them, serving the people or treating the masses as slaves—this is the dividing line between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, and the dividing line between revolution and counterrevolution or non-revolution. Our Party cadres, whether old or new, must be highly vigilant against the revisionist fallacies spread by Liu Shaoqi and must be vigilant against the infiltration of bourgeois ideas. We must deeply understand and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses," walk the path of uniting with the workers and peasants, sincerely accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, consciously place ourselves under the strict supervision of the revolutionary masses, be good representatives of the people, and be genuine servants of the people.

In summary, the fundamental principle for cadres to achieve revolutionization is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought from above and the revolutionary masses from below. Let us advance boldly on the great road guided by the plenary session's communiqué.

    在全会公报的指引下阔步前进
    甘肃省革命委员会副主任　朱培屏
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的八届扩大的十二中全会，是具有伟大历史意义的会议。我们坚决拥护这次全会所作出的一切决议。
    两年多来，我国亿万革命人民在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，经过激烈、反复的阶级较量，冲破了重重障碍，终于摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级司令部，揪出了他在各地的代理人，取得了无产阶级文化大革命伟大的、决定性的胜利。全会公报的发表，宣告了刘少奇一伙妄图在中国复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦彻底破产。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。在欢庆胜利的同时，我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，将革命进行到底。全会公报，就是我们将革命进行到底的指针，我们一定认真学习，深刻领会，坚决执行。
    革命将继续深入发展，阶级斗争的中心仍然是政权问题。我们许多党员、干部参加了新的革命政权，这是党和劳动人民对我们的信任。如何掌好权，用好权？这是摆在我们面前的极其严肃的问题，必须以实际行动来回答。
    要掌好权，用好权，最根本的一条，就是用毛泽东思想统帅自己的灵魂，指挥自己的行动。要把毛泽东思想学到手，融化在血液中，落实到行动上。必须以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，不断地斗私批修，不断地清除自己灵魂深处的非无产阶级思想，不断地改造世界观。不破不立，不克服头脑中的资产阶级思想，就立不起毛泽东思想。一个无产阶级的党必须“吐故纳新”，才能朝气蓬勃；一个革命干部也只有不断地自觉地在思想上“吐故纳新”，才能把毛泽东思想学到手，才能用党性掌好权，才能永葆革命青春。一个真正的无产阶级的革命的领导班子，在阶级斗争中，不断地在思想上“吐故纳新”，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，用毛泽东思想掌好权，用好权，这是根本的根本。
    要掌好权，用好权，就必须相信群众，依靠群众，密切联系群众。毛主席最相信群众，革命群众最听毛主席的话。相信群众还是鄙视群众，联系群众还是脱离群众，保护群众还是压制群众，为人民服务还是把群众当奴隶，这是无产阶级世界观与资产阶级世界观的分界线，是革命与不革命或反革命的分界线。我们党的干部，不论是老干部还是新干部，都必须十分警惕刘少奇所散布的修正主义谬论，都必须警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀。我们干革命，要深刻理解、坚决执行毛主席关于“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众”的伟大教导，走与工农群众相结合的道路，诚心诚意地接受工农兵的再教育，自觉地把自己置于革命群众的严格监督之下，当好人民的代表，作一个名副其实的人民的勤务员。
    总之，干部实现革命化的根本的根本，就是上靠毛泽东思想，下靠革命群众。让我们在全会公报指引的大道上，阔步前进。
