The revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, inspired by the plenum communiqué, are acting swiftly and decisively, taking measures and acting quickly to launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and making production even more outstanding.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad revolutionary workers, revolutionary family members, and PLA support-left personnel stationed in the Beijing New China Printing Factory are pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire factory to a new high tide with unprecedented revolutionary fighting spirit, and making various production tasks even more outstanding. A revolutionary mass movement to resolutely implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is surging forward in the entire factory.

In the days since the communiqué was issued, the more than three thousand revolutionary workers, several thousand family members, and PLA support-left personnel stationed in the Beijing New China Printing Factory have been immersed in an atmosphere of unprecedented joy. They enthusiastically applauded the plenum's wise decision to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his Party and non-Party positions, and to continue to settle accounts with his and his accomplices' crimes of betraying the Party and the country. The revolutionary workers, family members, and PLA support-left personnel enthusiastically responded to the various combat calls issued by the plenum. On the evening the communiqué was issued, members of the revolutionary committee of the factory and revolutionary workers from various workshops immediately conducted all-night study and discussion, and formulated specific measures for implementation. The revolutionary workers of the rotary press workshop immediately held a criticism meeting against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and the capitalist-roaders within the factory. The workers at the criticism meeting angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, who, in order to achieve his evil goals of usurping the Party, the government, and the military, did everything he could to oppose the printing of Chairman Mao's works and portraits.

In recent days, inspired by the communiqué, a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation has swept through the entire factory, including the family areas.

The workers said: "The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is our guiding light. We will create the most outstanding achievements in revolution and production and dedicate them to the Ninth Party Congress." Currently, the factory is earnestly implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy, a vigorous vanguard organization." After studying the communiqué, the workers, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the factory, will better implement Chairman Mao's teaching of "discarding the old and taking in the new" and do a good job in party rectification and party building. In recent days, criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on party building has become the central content of the revolutionary criticism throughout the factory. In recent days, regardless of what work is carried out or what new tasks are accepted, every class, every workshop in the entire factory must combine the study of the communiqué with a deep criticism of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The more the workers study the communiqué, the clearer their minds become, and the more they carry out revolutionary criticism, the more energetic they become. Revolutionary criticism, riding on the momentum of the communiqué's issuance, is unfolding with unprecedented breadth and depth throughout the factory. The factory's family areas are also more vibrant these days. A seventy-six-year-old old woman spoke at a revolutionary criticism meeting in the family area, saying: "Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, wanted to turn our Communist Party into a revisionist party and restore capitalism, making us, who have suffered in the old society, suffer again. Now that the Party has expelled him, I am truly indescribably happy!"

The revolutionary high tide is driving the production high tide. Inspired by the communiqué, all the revolutionary workers in the factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," are striving to print more, faster, and better copies of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and portraits. In recent days, production has seen a new leap. They work day and night, combining hard work with smart work, and are vigorously carrying out technological innovations and technological revolutions. The binding workshop successfully trial-produced an automatic binding machine on the night the communiqué was broadcast, replacing the previous manual operations and greatly improving work efficiency. The letterpress workshop's flatbed press has never been used to print Chairman Mao's works. Inspired by the plenum communiqué, the workers broke the old rules and regulations, making the flatbed press print high-quality copies of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books for the first time and creating a new record for flatbed press production.

    坚决执行党的十二中全会提出的战斗任务
    北京新华印刷厂革命职工，在全会公报的鼓舞下，雷厉风行，制订措施，迅速行动，掀起斗批改新高潮，生产搞得更加出色
    新华社五日讯　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，北京新华印刷厂的广大革命工人、革命家属和解放军驻厂支左人员，正以无比高昂的革命斗志，把全厂的斗、批、改推向一个新的高潮，把各项生产搞得更加出色。一个坚决贯彻执行八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务的革命群众运动，正在全厂蓬勃兴起。
    在公报发表后的这些日子里，北京新华印刷厂的三千多名革命职工、几千名家属和驻厂解放军支左人员，一直沉浸在无比欢乐的气氛中。他们热烈欢呼全会英明地决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党、撤消其党内外一切职务，并继续清算他和他的同伙叛党叛国的罪行。革命职工、家属和解放军支左人员热烈响应全会发出的各项战斗号召。公报发表的当晚，厂革命委员会成员和各车间的革命职工，立即通宵达旦地进行学习、讨论，并且订出了贯彻执行的具体措施。轮转车间的革命工人立即举行了对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇以及本厂的走资派的批判大会。工人们在批判会上愤怒控诉了叛徒刘少奇为了达到其篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶目的，千方百计地反对印制毛主席著作和毛主席画像的滔天罪行。
    连日来，在公报的鼓舞下，全厂包括家属区在内，到处掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    工人同志们说：“八届十二中全会公报是我们的指路明灯。我们要在革命和生产上创造出最优异的成绩，向党的‘九大’献礼。”目前，这个厂正在认真落实伟大领袖毛主席“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的指示。工人们学习公报之后，决心在厂革委会领导下，更好地执行毛主席“吐故纳新”的教导，搞好整党建党工作。这几天批判叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义的建党路线，成了全厂革命大批判的中心内容。全厂各个班组、车间，这几天不论开展什么工作、接受什么新任务，都要结合学习公报，对叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线展开深入的大批判。工人们越学公报心越明，越开展革命大批判劲越足。革命的大批判，乘着公报发表的浩荡东风，正以空前的广度和深度在全厂展开。工厂的家属区，这几天也更加朝气蓬勃。一个七十六岁的老大娘，在家属区举行的革命大批判会上登台发言，她说：“刘少奇这个叛徒妄想把我们的共产党变成修正主义的党，复辟资本主义，叫我们旧社会过来的受苦人再受二遍苦，现在党把他清除出去，我心里真是说不出有多么痛快！”
    革命的高潮推动着生产的高潮。在公报的鼓舞下，全厂广大革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，为了把毛主席的革命宝书和毛主席画像印得更多、更快、更好，这几天生产上也出现了新的飞跃。他们不分白天黑夜，苦干加巧干，大搞技术革新和技术革命。装订车间在公报广播的当晚，就试制成功了自动包本机，代替了过去的手工操作，大大提高了工作效率。铅印车间的平台机从来没有用来印毛主席著作，工人们在全会公报的鼓舞下，破除旧的清规戒律，使平台机第一次印出了质量好的毛主席的革命宝书，并且创造了平台机产量的最高纪录。
