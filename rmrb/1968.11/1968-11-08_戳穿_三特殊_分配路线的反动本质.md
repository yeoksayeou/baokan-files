In 1964, Liu Shaoqi, along with his black henchmen such as An Ziwen, concocted a counter-revolutionary revisionist distribution work line of the "three specials"—"selecting special talents, providing special training, and using them for special purposes."

The so-called "special talents" refer to those who are supposedly "clear-headed," have a "high level of education," possess "professional abilities," "work capabilities," and "technical skills," and are "young" university graduates. In this context, the fundamental principles of the proletariat, Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serving the people, and closely connecting with the masses are all completely discarded. It is clear that these "talents" are the cream of the crop from the old education system, walking the path of being "red and expert," and are the seeds of revisionism.

The so-called "special training" refers to conducting three to four months of short-term training, then going to the countryside to engage in "four cleanups" for a year or two, allowing those in charge of managing intellectual work to manage the education of these "special talents." Look, neither learning Mao Zedong Thought nor participating in long-term mass struggles and learning from the workers and peasants—such "training" is actually poisoning! Their so-called going to the countryside to engage in "four cleanups" is merely to add a layer of "gold" and gain political capital for climbing up. Under the guise of "special training," this group of traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders divide and control, layer by layer, using words and actions to corrupt the youth, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities of surrender and betrayal, forming factions, and private dealings.

The so-called "special purposes" refer to "serving in high-level leadership positions," that is, acting as "high-level successors." The big traitor An Ziwen once admitted, "Successorship and official succession are one and the same." This statement exposed their wolfish ambitions! They want to place Liu Shaoqi's favored people in various leadership positions from the central to the local levels, seizing leadership from the proletarian headquarters.

By utilizing the graduation distribution work, they select a group of bourgeois intellectuals, give them a dose of revisionist training, create a bourgeois privileged class, seize the party and the government, and achieve counter-revolutionary restoration. This is the counter-revolutionary essence of the "three specials" distribution work line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and An Ziwen and their ilk.

Today, the "three specials" distribution work line has not been thoroughly criticized and repudiated. A small handful of class enemies are using this gap in our thinking to sneak in and spread sugar-coated bullets, attempting to pull us over to their side.

We are not some "special talents"; we are Chairman Mao's loyal Red Guards, ordinary proletarian revolutionaries! We do not want any "special training"; we want to integrate with the workers and peasants and grow through the three great revolutionary movements on the front lines! We have no "special purposes"; we want to follow Chairman Mao and dedicate our lives to the revolution! We do not want "special" treatment; we want revolution. We will resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao of "integrating with the workers and peasants" and march forward!

### 戳穿“三特殊”分配路线的反动本质

    戳穿“三特殊”分配路线的反动本质
    华东师范大学红卫兵　萧任武
    一九六四年，刘少奇伙同其黑干将安子文之流，炮制了一条“三个特殊”——“挑选特殊的人才，进行特殊的培养，用于特殊的用途”的反革命修正主义分配工作路线。
    所谓“特殊人才”，就是所谓“头脑清醒”、“文化程度高”，有“业务能力”、“工作能力”、“技术水平”，“年轻”的大学毕业生。在这里，无产阶级政治，毛泽东思想，全心全意为人民服务，紧密联系群众，这些最根本的东西全都被剜掉了。很清楚，这种“人才”就是旧教育制度下培养出来的走白专道路的“尖子”，是修正主义的苗子。
    所谓“特殊培养”，就是说的搞三、四个月的短期训练，再下乡去搞一年半载“四清”，让所谓“熟悉知识分子工作的负责干部”去管理教育这些“特殊人才”。请看，既不要学习毛泽东思想，又不要参加长期的群众斗争，向工农群众学习，这样的“培养”实际上就是毒害！他所谓的下乡搞“四清”，那只是为了镀一层“金”，捞取向上爬的政治资本。在“特殊培养”的幌子下，由他们这伙叛徒、特务、走资派分兵把口，层层控制，言教身传，腐蚀青年，大搞其招降纳叛、结党营私的反革命勾当。
    所谓“特殊用途”，就是说的“担任高级领导机关的领导工作”，即所谓充当“高级接班人”。大叛徒安子文就不打自招地说过：“接班和接官是一致的。”一句话暴露了他们的狼子野心！他就是要把刘少奇的意中人安插在从中央到地方的各级领导岗位，从无产阶级司令部手里篡夺领导权。
    利用毕业分配工作，物色一批资产阶级知识分子，进行一番修正主义的培养，弄出一个资产阶级特权阶层，篡党篡政，实现反革命复辟，这就是刘少奇、安子文之流推行“三个特殊”的分配工作路线的反革命实质。
    今天，“三个特殊”的分配工作路线还没有批倒批臭。一小撮阶级敌人正利用我们思想上的这个缺口，乘机施放糖衣炮弹，妄想把我们拉过去。
    我们不是什么“特殊人才”，我们是毛主席的忠实的红卫兵，普通的无产阶级革命战士！我们不要什么“特殊培养”，我们要同工农群众相结合，在三大革命运动的火线上锻炼成长！我们没有什么“特殊用途”，我们要紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命！我们不要“特殊”，而要革命。我们坚决沿着毛主席指引的“同工农群众结合”的道路，阔步前进！
