Following Chairman Mao's great instructions, the Guangshan County Revolutionary Committee firmly relies on, mobilizes, and organizes poor and lower-middle peasants to seize back the power of rural education from the bourgeois intellectuals. They implement the direct management of schools by poor and lower-middle peasants, rapidly developing the rural education revolution and presenting a lively revolutionary scene everywhere.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangshan County have fully taken over the rural primary and secondary schools, smashed the old education system, old teaching guidelines, and methods. Originally, this county had 315 public primary schools, 153 private primary schools, and 8 secondary schools. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, starting from the convenience of managing schools according to Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, have established 331 new private primary schools throughout the county, including a batch of seven-year continuous schools (primary schools with attached junior high school classes). This has achieved the goal of "going to primary school without leaving the production brigade and entering junior high school without leaving the commune." These new-type schools, personally established and directly managed by poor and lower-middle peasants, are advancing along the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the communes and production brigades in Guangshan County have successively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying and deeply understanding the spirit of the plenary session. They compare their work with the great task of completing the proletarian education revolution proposed by the plenary session, find gaps, formulate measures, and are determined to promote the further development of the rural education revolution.

In January of this year, after the establishment of the Guangshan County Revolutionary Committee, the county revolutionary committee and relevant personnel seriously studied Chairman Mao's proletarian education revolution thoughts. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they decided to have the revolutionary committee members lead the working personnel to form study groups and investigation groups, go to the masses, listen to the masses' opinions, learn from the masses, and pay attention to discovering and cultivating typical examples of rural education revolution, establishing models for rural education revolution, and using these typical examples and models to promote the rural education revolution throughout the county.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangshan County have long hated the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line promoted by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and hated the bourgeois intellectuals who controlled the schools. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the old education system and are determined to establish schools that conform to Chairman Mao's proletarian education line. In this revolution, Hongqi Commune took the lead. The poor and lower-middle peasants of this commune thoroughly smashed Liu Shaoqi's revisionist education line and thoroughly established Chairman Mao's proletarian education line. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of commune- and brigade-run schools, "where conditions permit, it should be allowed to be established," starting from the convenience of managing schools according to Mao Zedong Thought. They decided to take over all the schools within the commune from the bourgeois intellectuals. They used Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as a guideline to quickly establish a two-year junior high school, a seven-year continuous school, and thirteen five-year continuous primary schools managed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

The personnel investigating and researching at the lower levels of the revolutionary committee believed that the achievements of the education revolution in Hongqi Commune are the fruits of Chairman Mao's proletarian education revolution thoughts; their practices completely meet the requirements of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, the county revolutionary committee decided to organize representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students from various communes and production brigades in the district to hold an on-site meeting in Hongqi Commune, promote the experience of Hongqi Commune, mobilize poor and lower-middle peasants to seize back the power of rural education from the bourgeois intellectuals, and change public schools into brigade-run schools for the convenience of poor and lower-middle peasants to manage. The holding of the on-site meeting promoted the rural education revolution, and a "learn from Hongqi, catch up with Hongqi" mass school-running activity quickly swept across the rural areas of the entire county. The mountainous area of Suogu, which had no middle school for more than a decade after liberation, used to require students to travel over a hundred miles of mountains and valleys to attend middle school in other places, and few children of poor and lower-middle peasants went to school. After learning from the experience of Hongqi Commune, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this area used Chairman Mao's education revolution thoughts as a weapon to expose, accuse, and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line promoted by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They adopted the method of "commune-run seven-year primary schools with attached junior high school classes, brigade-run primary schools" to quickly establish a batch of schools, opening the door of convenience for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to go to school.

　　遵照毛主席的伟大教导  坚定不移地依靠贫下中农管理学校
　　谷城县农村教育革命迅猛发展
　　全县实现了“上小学不出本大队，进中学不出本公社”
    据新华社武汉十四日电　湖北省谷城县革命委员会坚定不移地依靠、发动、组织贫下中农从资产阶级知识分子手里夺回农村教育大权，实行由贫下中农直接办学，使全县农村教育革命迅猛发展，到处呈现一派生气勃勃的大好革命景象。
    目前，谷城县广大贫下中农已经全面接管了农村的中、小学，砸烂了旧的教育制度、旧的教学方针和方法。原来这个县的农村有三百一十五所公办小学，一百五十三所民办小学，八所中学。广大贫下中农从便于自己按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线管理学校出发，全县又由公社、生产大队新办起了三百三十一所民办小学，其中包括一批七年一贯制即小学附设初中班的学校，实现了“上小学不出本大队，进中学不出本公社”。这批由贫下中农亲手创办、直接管理的新型学校，正沿着毛主席的“五·七”指示指引的光辉道路阔步前进。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，谷城县的社、队纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、深刻领会公报精神，对照全会提出的必须完成无产阶级教育革命的伟大任务，查找自己工作中的差距，制订措施，决心推动农村教育革命进一步发展。
    今年元月，谷城县革命委员会成立后，县革命委员会和有关人员认真学习了毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想，遵照毛主席的教导，决定由革委会成员带领工作人员，组成学习组、调查组，到群众中去，听取群众意见，向群众学习，并注意发现、培养农村教育革命的典型，树立农村教育革命的样板，用这些典型、样板来推动全县农村的教育革命。
    谷城县的广大贫下中农早就恨透了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，恨透了统治学校的资产阶级知识分子。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批旧的教育制度，决心创办符合毛主席无产阶级教育路线的学校。在这场革命中，红旗公社走在了前面。这个公社的贫下中农，大破刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，他们遵照毛主席“关于社办、队办学校问题，有条件的应该允许办”的教导，从便于自己按照毛泽东思想管理学校出发，决定把全公社范围内的学校都从资产阶级知识分子手中接管过来。他们以毛主席的“五·七”指示为指针，迅速地办起了由贫下中农管理的一所二年制初中、一所七年一贯制的学校和十三所五年一贯制的小学。
    县革委会在下面调查研究的人员，认为红旗公社教育革命的成就，是毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想的硕果；他们的做法，完全符合广大贫下中农的要求。于是县革委会决定以区为单位，组织各公社、生产大队的贫下中农代表、革命干部和革命师生，到红旗公社举行现场会，推广红旗公社的经验，发动贫下中农从资产阶级知识分子手里夺回农村教育大权，并把公办学校改为队办，以便贫下中农管理。现场会议的召开，推动了农村教育革命，一个“学红旗，赶红旗”的群众办学活动，迅速在全县农村掀起。解放后十几年来没有一所中学的大山区粟谷区，过去学生到外地念中学得翻山越岭跑一百多里路，贫下中农子女很少入学。学习红旗公社的经验后，这个区的贫下中农以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线进行了大揭露、大控诉、大批判。他们采取“公社办七年制小学附设初中班，生产大队办小学”的办法，迅速地办起了一批学校，为贫下中农子女入学开了方便之门。
