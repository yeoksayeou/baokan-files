We are technical personnel supporting the construction of Albania. During our stay in Albania, we worked and labored alongside the Albanian people and were deeply moved by their industrious and brave qualities. In the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and their running dogs, the Albanian people have shown great heroism; in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, they have shown a spirit of defying difficulties and pressing forward. We worked in this heroic country for a year or two and forged a deep friendship with the Albanian people. Now, as we recall this beautiful memory, we still feel deeply moved.

The Albanian people are full of enthusiasm and vitality. The broad masses of workers and peasants are full of spirit and vigor. In Elbasan, we saw about a dozen workers who were both porters and bricklayers, busy working all day. Year after year, they built a tall five-story building. Such a small number of people achieving such outstanding results is truly remarkable.

In addition to working hard at their posts to build production, the Albanian people actively participate in voluntary labor. Now, voluntary labor has become an indispensable part of Albanian life. Lenin once praised voluntary labor as a "great innovation," as the "beginning of a more difficult, more important, more profound, and more decisive transformation than the overthrow of the bourgeoisie." The Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha attach great importance to voluntary labor. The Party and the government not only mobilize the people to support socialist construction through voluntary labor but, more importantly, regard it as an important measure to cultivate people's communist spirit and promote ideological revolutionization.

In the early spring of 1967, on a Sunday, almost the entire city of Elbasan was mobilized. Shops stopped business, and cars stopped running. Local troops, workers, students, government officials, and residents formed a tree-planting army, led by local Party, government, and military leaders, carrying red flags, playing military music, singing revolutionary songs, and marching towards the hills outside the city in a grand procession.

Winter is the rainy season in Albania. Last winter, it rained for more than twenty days. On the construction site where we participated, the rainwater mixed with the soil, making it seem like a marsh of dark brown color. To speed up the construction progress and overcome the transportation difficulties during the rainy season, the first secretary of the Elbasan District Committee personally led the voluntary labor force to the site.

The Albanian comrades have an infinite love for Comrade Enver Hoxha and our great leader Chairman Mao. After they arrived at the construction site, they first visited our living quarters. Seeing the quotations about the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples by Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha hanging on our walls, the first secretary led the way in reading them aloud. At this moment, we were deeply moved by the revolutionary sentiments of the Albanian comrades and read aloud with them:

"Please believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together."

"Its people, party, and government will always march forward with the great people of China and the Communist Party of China on the common revolutionary road, standing shoulder to shoulder with them in times of peace and in storms, advancing together in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and for the victory of revolution and socialism."

Thus, on this construction site, a scene of joint labor by the peoples of China and Albania appeared. The Albanian comrades, regardless of the mud, chased each other, carrying one heavy iron piece after another. Their boots sank in the mud, but they did not care; they braved the cold, barefoot in the deep mud, coming and going. Our Xiaoyu and the Albanian comrade Betri formed a "red pair" during labor. They worked together to insert steel wire ropes. This was a heavy task, and the efficiency was initially low. But after studying, they found a way, cooperated closely, and the efficiency improved rapidly, receiving everyone's praise.

Not only adults, but also middle and primary school students participate in voluntary labor. A group of young girls and boys, because of their young age, were arranged to clean the site. As soon as they arrived, they rushed to work, touching whatever they could. While working, they sang Chinese revolutionary songs. The clear voices still carried a bit of childishness, making one feel very affectionate. The Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha have cultivated a generation of young people who love labor from an early age, ensuring that they can become ordinary laborers when they grow up.

Shared life and shared labor have closely united us with the Albanian comrades. We still clearly remember that when we completed the construction project and were about to return home, the Albanian comrades heard the news and rushed over. They reluctantly held our hands, tears in their eyes, bidding us farewell.

We have been back home for some time now. However, whenever we recall our unforgettable experiences in Albania, many passionate and vigorous images appear in our minds. This is a great nation of heroic people. We still often think of them. We believe that the Albanian comrades will also remember us. Although we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. The peoples of China and Albania will forever fight side by side. Our revolutionary friendship will last forever, like the evergreen trees.

    中阿两国人民的革命友谊万古长青
    尤卫东　钟向阳
    我们是支援阿尔巴尼亚建设的技术人员。我们在阿尔巴尼亚生活的日子里，和阿尔巴尼亚人民一起工作和劳动，深为他们勤劳、勇敢的优秀品质所感动。阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗的斗争中，表现了大无畏的英雄气概；而在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，同样表现了蔑视困难、一往无前的革命精神。我们在这个英雄的国度工作了一两年，同阿尔巴尼亚人民结下了深厚的友谊。现在我们重温这段美好的记忆，仍然感到无比的激动。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民热情饱满，生气勃勃。广大的工人农民，意气风发，干劲十足。在爱尔巴桑，我们看见十来个工人，他们既是搬运工，又是泥瓦工，整天忙碌着干活。经年累月，竟盖成了一座高大的五层楼。这么少的人干出了这样出色的成绩，这是多么了不起啊。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民除了在自己的工作岗位上努力进行生产建设外，还积极参加义务劳动。现在，义务劳动已经成为阿尔巴尼亚人民生活中不可分离的部分。列宁当年称赞义务劳动是“伟大的创举”，是“比推翻资产阶级更困难、更重大、更深刻、更有决定意义的变革的开端”。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志十分重视义务劳动。党和政府不仅动员人民以义务劳动来支援社会主义建设，更重要的是把它作为培养人们共产主义精神、促进思想革命化的重要措施之一。
    一九六七年初春的一个星期天，爱尔巴桑几乎全城出动。商店停止营业，汽车停止运行。当地的驻军、工人、学生、机关干部和街道居民组成一支植树大军，由当地的党政军首长率领，高举红旗，奏着军乐，高唱革命歌曲，浩浩荡荡地开赴郊外的山岗。
    冬天是阿尔巴尼亚的雨季。去年冬天，一连下了二十多天雨，在我们参加的工程建设工地上，雨水和泥土混在一起，仿佛一片酱色的沼泽地。为了加速工程施工进度，克服雨季现场运输的困难，爱尔巴桑区委第一书记亲自率领义务劳动大军来到工地。
    阿尔巴尼亚同志无限热爱恩维尔·霍查同志，无限热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席。他们来到工地以后，首先参观我们的驻地，看见我们墙上悬挂着的毛主席和霍查同志关于中阿人民友谊的语录，第一书记同志便带头高声朗读。这时候，我们深为阿尔巴尼亚同志的革命情谊所激动，也跟他们一起高声朗读：
    “请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    “我国人民、我们党和政府同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党在共同的革命道路上前进，无论在和平的日子里，还是在暴风雨的时刻，都将永远同他们肩并肩地站在一起，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、争取革命和社会主义胜利的斗争中共同前进。”
    于是，在这个建设工地上，出现了中阿两国人民共同劳动的热烈场面。阿尔巴尼亚同志不顾泥泞，你追我赶，运送着一根又一根粗大的铁件。靴子陷在泥里也不顾，他们冒着严寒，光着双脚在深深的泥浆里往来穿梭。我们的小于和阿尔巴尼亚的贝特里同志在劳动中结成“一对红”，他们一块儿插钢丝绳头。这是一桩重活，开头效率较低。但他们经过钻研，找到了窍门，通力合作，效率迅速提高，受到大家的表扬。
    不仅成年人，中小学的学生也参加义务劳动。一群小姑娘和小男孩因为年纪小，便安排他们清理场地。他们一来便抢着干活，摸着什么干什么。一边干，一边唱着中国的革命歌曲。清脆的歌声还带着几分稚气，十分叫人疼爱。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志培养的少年一代，从小就热爱劳动，这保证他们长大以后能够当一个普通的劳动者。
    共同的生活、共同的劳动，把我们和阿尔巴尼亚同志紧密地团结在一起。我们还清楚地记得，当我们结束工程建设，即将启程回国的时候，阿尔巴尼亚的同志闻讯赶来。他们依依不舍地拉着我们的手，噙着热泪和我们告别。
    我们回国已经有好些日子了。但是，每当我们回忆起在阿尔巴尼亚那段难忘的经历，脑海里便涌现出许多热情澎湃、朝气蓬勃的形象。这是一个伟大国家的英雄的人民。我们现在仍然不时想念着他们。我们相信，阿尔巴尼亚的同志也一定会惦记着我们的。我们虽然远隔千山万水，但是我们的心是连在一起的。中阿两国人民将永远并肩战斗，我们之间的革命友谊，将和那些常青树一样地万古长青。
