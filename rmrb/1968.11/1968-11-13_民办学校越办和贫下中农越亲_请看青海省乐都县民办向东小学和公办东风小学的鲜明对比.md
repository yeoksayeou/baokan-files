Private schools become more popular and close to poor and lower-middle peasants: A comparison of Xiangdong Primary School and Dongfeng Primary School in Hainan County, Qinghai Province

Xiangdong Primary School is a private school in Xiangdong Production Brigade, Dongfeng People's Commune, Hainan County, Qinghai Province. It currently has 87 students and 4 teachers, of whom three are selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants from the brigade members to participate in the production team's distribution. Dongfeng Primary School is a public school in Dongfeng People's Commune, with 209 students and 9 staff members. Practice has proven that the more private schools are run, the closer they become to the poor and lower-middle peasants, while the more public schools are run, the farther they become from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

I. Two Directions of Education

Since its establishment, Xiangdong Primary School has been managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1964, the brigade leader also served as the school principal. The establishment of this school went through a sharp struggle. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the provincial and county party used the pretext of "exercising business leadership over private schools" to sabotage them in every possible way. They did not allow private school students to participate in political activities or in the collective labor of the production team, and they launched a "red five-point" campaign to try to steer private schools onto the revisionist educational path. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiangdong Brigade resisted this trend, saying, "Our children cannot be separated from labor, and we must participate in the class struggle of the production team. We are a private school and cannot follow your rules." To solve the problem of poor and lower-middle peasant children attending high school nearby, in 1964, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiangdong Brigade proposed to expand Xiangdong Primary School into a complete primary school. This again met with obstruction from a small clique of capitalist roaders within the former county people's committee education bureau, who said, "Xiangdong Primary School is not regular, and the brigade does not have the conditions to run a high school," and "this will lower the quality of teaching," suppressing the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants for running schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiangdong Brigade fought back against them, saying, "We run schools through self-reliance, so why can't we run them?" The party secretary and brigade leader of Xiangdong Brigade personally went to the county education bureau more than ten times for this matter. After several rounds of struggle, under the pressure of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the county education bureau finally had to acknowledge this complete primary school.

The public Dongfeng Primary School is completely different from the private Xiangdong Primary School. This school does not allow students to engage in class struggle or participate in the collective labor of the production team. It stipulates that stopping classes for one day requires approval from the school district, and stopping classes for three days requires approval from the county education bureau. In short, it wants students to be separated from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to study in isolation, and to follow the path of intellectuals divorced from physical labor. As a result, the more the school is run, the farther it is from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Sending our children to such a school, we really don't feel at ease."

For whom does the school open its doors? The two schools are completely different. Xiangdong Primary School's educational power is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the school considers the poor and lower-middle peasants in everything: First, there is no age limit for enrollment. Second, poor and lower-middle peasant children are allowed to bring their younger siblings to school, and the school makes proper arrangements for them. Third, poor and lower-middle peasant students from difficult families are exempt from tuition fees, and those who cannot pay temporarily can defer payment. Fourth, the school regularly reports its work to the brigade and solicits the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants on running the school. Fifth, the school strengthens the extracurricular guidance of poor and lower-middle peasant students so that they are not affected by too much household labor. These practical measures are deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, who say, "This is the kind of school that serves us poor and lower-middle peasants." The situation at Dongfeng Primary School is the opposite. They emphasize that "the school must be regular" and "the level must be uniform." Poor and lower-middle peasant children who are over the school age are not allowed to enroll, those who cannot pay tuition fees are not allowed to enroll, those who miss classes frequently due to household labor are required to drop out, and students who have poor grades or are "naughty and mischievous" are not allowed to advance. Various rules and regulations keep most poor and lower-middle peasant children out of the school gates. The vast majority of students who are held back or drop out are also poor and lower-middle peasant children. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflect that such a school spends the money of the poor and lower-middle peasants but does not do things for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

II. Two Goals of Cultivation

Xiangdong Primary School is directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants in teaching, and the school treats Chairman Mao's works as the main course. The poor and lower-middle peasants often give students lectures on village history and family history, and conduct production labor classes, carrying out class education and labor education for the students. The school's teachers and students participate with the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade in the Four Cleanups, the purification of class ranks, revolutionary criticism, and the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, greatly enhancing the teachers' and students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Eleven- and twelve-year-old students understand that landlords appear to be honest but actually hate us for dividing their houses and farming their land. Many students realize that we can study in school today because Chairman Mao has brought us happiness, and we must study hard to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants when we grow up. The students of this school are concerned about the collective from a young age and actively participate in the educational revolution in the school, organizing voluntary labor enthusiastically; when they return to the brigade, they do everything from mending fences to sweeping the yard. The students of Xiangdong Primary School also actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household.

Dongfeng Primary School is different. This school has long promoted "intellectual education first," "grades first," and "advancement first." Many students have been poisoned by the "study to become an official" theory of the number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, with their study goals permeated by the word "self." Some students are "grades first" in school and "work points first" in the production team. A student in Dongfeng Brigade, when recording work points during labor, said, "I study because my father supports me, not because you support me." The poor and lower-middle peasants say: Dongfeng Primary School cultivates students who are "big" (arrogant), "high" (eyes high, hands high), "three don't knows" (don't know the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society; don't know class struggle and class oppression; don't know how to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants), "four separations" (separated from politics, separated from labor, separated from reality, separated from the poor and lower-middle peasants), lazy, and ignorant of the five grains. They are afraid of hard work, afraid of dirty work, and their attitudes have changed. If such a school continues, our children will become revisionists, and the country will change color.

III. Two Methods of Running Schools

Xiangdong Private Primary School relies on the masses and follows the path of "self-reliance and thrift in running schools." The school uses local materials and makes do with what is available, running the school according to the actual situation. The production team repairs the school's buildings and makes desks, and also mobilizes the students to repair desks, teaching aids, and walls, with the school's expenses being very low. For example, from 1965 to 1967, the total expenditure was 2,279 yuan, averaging 7 yuan per student per year, of which the state's public assistance fee was 2.4 yuan per person per year, and the production team actually bore 4.6 yuan per student per year. The public Dongfeng Primary School almost relies entirely on the state. According to statistics from 1965 to 1967, the school spent a total of 19,916 yuan, averaging 27 yuan per student per year, which is four times the cost of private schools.

Xiangdong Primary School, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become better and better. Especially after Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—poor and lower-middle peasants" were issued, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiangdong Brigade and the revolutionary teachers and students of Xiangdong Primary School, after thorough discussion and preparation, established the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee, further strengthening the management of this school. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: "Chairman Mao trusts and cares for us poor and lower-middle peasants so much, we must manage Xiangdong Primary School better and run it better."

　　民办学校越办和贫下中农越亲
　　请看青海省乐都县民办向东小学和公办东风小学的鲜明对比
    向东小学是青海省乐都县东风公社向东大队的民办学校，现有学生八十七名，教师四名，其中除一名民办公助教员外，其余三名都是由本队贫下中农从社员中推选的，参加生产队分配。东风小学是东风公社的公办学校，现有学生二百零九名，教职员工共九人。实践证明：民办学校越办和贫下中农越亲，公办学校越办离贫下中农越远。
    一、两种办学方向
    向东小学创办以来就由贫下中农管理，一九六四年大队长兼任该校校长。办这所学校是经过一场尖锐斗争的。省、县党内一小撮走资派借口“对民办学校实行业务领导”，曾千方百计进行破坏。他们不准民办学校的学生参加政治活动和参加生产队的集体劳动，大搞什么“红五分”运动，企图把民办学校拉上修正主义教育路线的邪路。向东大队贫下中农顶住了这股歪风，他们气愤地说：“我们贫下中农的孩子不能脱离劳动，生产队的阶级斗争就是要参加。我们是民办学校，不能按你们那一套来。”为了解决贫下中农子女就近念高小的问题，一九六四年向东大队的贫下中农，纷纷提出要把向东初小扩建成为完全小学，这事又遭到旧县人委文教科党内一小撮走资派的阻拦，他们说什么：“向东小学不正规，大队办高小条件不具备”，“这样会降低教学质量”等，压制贫下中农的办学积极性。向东大队贫下中农同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争，贫下中农说：“我们自力更生办学，为什么不让我们办？”向东大队党支部书记和大队长为这事曾亲自到县文教科跑了十多趟。经过三番五次的斗争，在贫下中农的压力下，最后县文教科才不得不承认这所完全小学。
    公办的东风小学与民办的向东小学完全两样。这所学校不让学生接触阶级斗争，不让学生参加生产队的集体劳动，规定停课一天要由学区批准，停课三天要由县文教科批准。总之，要学生脱离贫下中农，关门读书，走白专道路。结果，学校越办离贫下中农越远。贫下中农说：“把我们的子女送进这样的学校，我们实在不放心。”
    学校为谁开门？两所学校也截然不同。向东小学的教育大权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里，学校处处为贫下中农着想：一、入学不受年龄限制。二、允许贫下中农子女带娃娃（弟弟妹妹）上学，学校进行妥善安排。三、家庭困难的贫下中农学生免交学费，暂时交不起的可以缓交。四、学校定期向大队汇报工作，征求贫下中农对办学的意见。五、加强对贫下中农学生的校外辅导，使他们不至于因家务劳动过多而影响学习。这些切实可行的办法都深受贫下中农的欢迎，他们说：“这样的学校才是为我们贫下中农服务的。”东风小学的情况则完全相反。他们强调“学校要正规”，“程度要统一”。贫下中农子女超过学龄不让上学，交不起学费不让上学，因家务劳动缺课多的学生要退学，分数不好、“调皮捣蛋”的学生不能升学。种种清规戒律，把大部分贫下中农子女关在学校门外。留级、退学的学生绝大部分也都是贫下中农子女。贫下中农反映，这样的学校花贫下中农的钱，不为贫下中农办事。
    二、两种培养目标
    向东小学由贫下中农直接参加教学管理，学校把毛主席著作作为主课来学。由贫下中农经常给学生讲村史、家史，上生产劳动课，对学生进行阶级教育和劳动教育。学校师生同本队贫下中农一起参加四清运动、清理阶级队伍、革命大批判、办毛泽东思想学习班等，大大提高了师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。十一、二岁的小学生懂得：地主表面上老实，实际看见我们分了他的房，种了他的地，他恨在心里，并不老实。许多学生认识到：我们今天能够在学校里念书，这是毛主席给我们带来的幸福，我们要好好学习，长大了为贫下中农服务。这个学校的学生从小关心集体，在学校积极参加教育革命，自动组织义务劳动，生龙活虎；回到队里垫圈、扫院，样样都干。向东小学的学生还积极宣传毛泽东思想，使毛主席的最新指示及时传达，家喻户晓。
    东风小学则不是这样。这所学校长期推行“智育第一”“分数挂帅”“升学第一”，不少学生受了党内头号走资派刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒害，学习目的贯穿一个“私”字。有的学生在学校里是“分数挂帅”，回到生产队是“工分挂帅”。东风大队有个学生，劳动时社员请他给记工分，他说：我念书是我阿大（父亲）供的，又不是你们供的。贫下中农说：东风小学培养出来的学生是“一大”（架子大）、“二高”（眼高、手高）、“三不知”（不知旧社会的苦、新社会的甜；不知阶级斗争和阶级压迫；不知怎样为贫下中农服务）、“四脱离”（脱离政治、脱离劳动、脱离实际、脱离贫下中农），四体不勤，五谷不分。干活怕累，垫圈怕脏，架子大了，说话的腔调变了。这样的学校办下去，我们的子女就会变修，国家就要变颜色。
    三、两种办学方法
    向东民办小学依靠群众，走“自力更生，勤俭办学”的道路，学校就地取材，因陋就简，按照实际情况办学。生产队给学校修缮房屋，制作课桌，也发动学生自己动手修课桌、教具、围墙等，学校的费用很小。例如一九六五年至一九六七年三年内，总共开支二千二百七十九元，平均每个学生每年开支七元，其中除国家公助费用每人每年二元四角外，生产队实际负担每个学生每年四元六角。公办的东风小学，几乎一切都要依赖国家，据一九六五年至一九六七年三年的统计，该校总共开支一万九千九百一十六元，平均每年每个学生国家要负担二十七元，为民办学校费用的四倍。
    向东小学经过无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼，越办越好了。特别是毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示发表以后，向东大队的贫下中农和向东小学的革命师生经过充分酝酿讨论，成立了贫下中农管理学校委员会，进一步加强了对这所学校的管理。贫下中农兴奋地说：“毛主席他老人家对我们贫下中农这样信任，这样关心，我们一定要把向东小学管得更好，办得更好。”　本报通讯员　本报记者
