The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party speaks the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The plenary session decided to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time, resolved to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, and affirmed the great victory of crushing the "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind of rehabilitating the "February Countercurrent." These wise resolutions and decisions, I support them a thousand times, ten thousand times.

At this happy moment, I recall the course of following Chairman Mao in making revolution. Every time at the crucial moment of the revolution, it is Chairman Mao who steered us firmly and pointed out the direction, leading the revolution to victory. Every victory we have achieved shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Indeed, following Chairman Mao means victory, following Chairman Mao means everything!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries struggle to the death with the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have fully proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's this thesis. The focus of struggle in every stage of the Cultural Revolution has been centered on the issue of power. The running dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in various places, after usurping part of the leadership, implemented a complete bourgeois dictatorship. They were so audacious as to openly oppose the great leader Chairman Mao, to carry out capitalist restoration, and to attempt to make us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, suffer double calamities.

In the old society, because the power was not in our hands, my family was forced to be the cow and horse of the landlords for four generations. Now, I can participate in the leadership work of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all because of Chairman Mao's leadership and the power being in the hands of us revolutionary masses!

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Our power is given by whom? It is given by the working class, by the poor and lower-middle peasants, by the broad laboring masses who make up more than 90% of the population. We represent the proletariat, represent the people, overthrow the enemies of the people, and the people support us. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." Chairman Mao's warm instruction points out the fundamental direction for the construction of the revolutionary committees. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use well the power given by Chairman Mao and the five thousand seven hundred million revolutionary people of the whole province.

From a commune peasant to a member of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, from holding a hoe to holding a seal, my position has changed, my post has changed. No matter how much it changes, my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "being an official and also a common people" and "being humble, prudent, guarding against arrogance and impatience, and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly," to keep close contact with the masses, to insist on participating in collective production labor, to keep the calluses on my hands thick forever, and to forever preserve the original color of the laboring people. I will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, loyally carry out and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and together with the revolutionary masses of the whole province, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    公报说出俺贫下中农心里话
    山东省革委会常委、全国农业劳动模范　张富贵
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，字字句句都说出了俺贫下中农的心里话。全会决定在适当的时候召开党的第九次全国代表大会，决议把刘少奇永远开除出党，还肯定了击溃“二月逆流”和为“二月逆流”翻案邪风的伟大胜利。这些英明的决议和决定，我一千个一万个拥护。
    在这幸福的时刻里，我回想起紧跟毛主席闹革命的战斗历程。每当革命的紧要关头都是毛主席给我们掌稳了舵，指明了航向，把革命引向胜利。我们所取得的每一个胜利都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。真是紧跟毛主席就是胜利，紧跟毛主席就有一切！
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”两年多的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，完全证明了毛主席这一论断的英明、正确。文化大革命每个阶段的斗争焦点，一直是围绕在政权这个问题上进行的。帝修反的走狗刘少奇和他在各地的代理人，篡夺了一部分领导权后，实行的完全是资产阶级专政。他们胆大包天，竟敢公开对抗伟大领袖毛主席，大搞资本主义复辟，妄图使我们广大贫下中农重遭二茬罪。
    在旧社会，因为政权不在我们手里，我家就被迫给地主当了四辈子牛马。如今，我能够参加省革命委员会的领导工作，就是因为有毛主席的领导，政权掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手里！
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席又教导我们：“我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”毛主席这一亲切教导为我们指出了革命委员会建设的根本方向。我们一定用毛泽东思想把毛主席和全省五千七百万革命人民给的权力掌好，用好。
    从公社农民到省革命委员会常委，从握锄把子到掌印把子，地位变了，职务变了。千变万变，我忠于毛主席的红心永远不变。我一定遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”和“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的教导，密切联系群众，坚持参加集体生产劳动，让手上的茧子永远厚厚的，永葆艰苦朴素的劳动人民本色。我一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，忠实贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和全省革命群众一起把文化大革命进行到底！
