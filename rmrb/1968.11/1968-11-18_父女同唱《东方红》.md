Father and Daughter Sing "The East Is Red"

Old miner Wang Yuhai deeply loves the great leader Chairman Mao. Every great call made by Chairman Mao, he responds to enthusiastically. However, if you ask him to say something, that would be difficult, and no one has ever heard him sing. Wang Yuhai has only one daughter, Wang Yajin, who unfortunately is a mute. Therefore, Wang's home is always quiet, with no sound.

Recently, the melodious tune of "The East Is Red" has been frequently heard from Wang Yuhai's home. The voices are high and low, sharp and rough, though the pitch is not very accurate, it is filled with the working class's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

This is Wang Yuhai's "mute daughter" Wang Yajin teaching her father to sing "The East Is Red."

Wang Yajin is a student at the Deaf-Mute School in Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province. She loves Chairman Mao deeply. However, due to her deaf-muteness, she cannot hear Chairman Mao's great voice and cannot shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" For this, she has shed countless tears in pain.

In March this year, the medical and propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army's 3016 Unit, which promotes Mao Zedong Thought, came to the deaf-mute school. They acupuncture-treated the deaf-mute students and promoted Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to Chairman Mao, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to open the "forbidden zone" of deaf-mutes, enabling the deaf-mute students to shout out the words they had long wanted to shout but could not: "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sing the song they had long wanted to sing but could not: "The East Is Red."

Wang Yuhai heard his daughter, who had been mute for seventeen years, clearly singing, "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong." The bitterness of the old society and the happiness of the new society surged into his heart, and tears streamed down his face.

Wang Yuhai's hometown is in Shandong. In 1938, his entire family was forced by the landlord to the point of death and destruction, leaving only him to escape to the Liaoyuan coal mine to sell his labor to the capitalist. Little did he know that escaping from the tiger's den only led him into the wolf's den, nearly being thrown into the human furnace by the capitalist. Fortunately, Chairman Mao commanded the liberation army to liberate Northeast China, saving him from the jaws of the tiger. After liberation, he got married at the age of forty and had a daughter. Unexpectedly, Yajin became mute at the age of three. Today, it is the People's Liberation Army, personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao, that has enabled these mute children to speak....

Wang Yuhai became more and more excited. He pulled his daughter in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "Yajin, you can sing today that Chairman Mao is our great savior. You should also know how Chairman Mao has saved us! For many years, I wanted to tell you about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, but you couldn't hear it. Today, Chairman Mao has given you good ears and a good mouth. Father should say a few more words!" Then, Wang Yuhai poured out all the words he had been holding back for many years. Finally, he pointed to Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "Child, Chairman Mao is our great savior. We must forever sing 'The East Is Red'! From today on, you will teach me, and Father will also learn to sing 'The East Is Red'." Wang Yajin knew that her father, due to the hardships he endured in the old society, would gasp for breath even when speaking a few words, let alone singing. So she asked her father, "Can you sing with your illness?" Wang Yuhai firmly said, "If you mute children can sing, why can't I? Singing 'The East Is Red' makes my heart feel good."

In this way, Wang Yajin taught her father to sing "The East Is Red" every day after school. This retired worker, who even finds it difficult to speak, has learned to sing "The East Is Red." From then on, Wang Yuhai's home is filled with the song "The East Is Red" every day.

　　父女同唱《东方红》
    老矿工王玉海对伟大领袖毛主席从心眼里热爱。毛主席的每一个伟大号召，他都积极响应。但是，要叫他说个啥，那可就难了，更没人听他唱过歌。王玉海只有一个独生女儿王雅琴，偏偏又是个哑巴。因此，王大爷的家里，成天静悄悄的，没有什么声音。
    最近，从王玉海家里不断传出嘹亮的《东方红》的歌声。声音一高一低，一尖一粗，音调虽然不够准确，却充满了工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情。
    这是王玉海的“哑姑娘”王雅琴在教爸爸唱《东方红》。
    王雅琴是吉林省辽源市聋哑学校的学生。她对毛主席无限热爱。但是，因为聋哑，使她有耳朵听不到毛主席的伟大声音，有嘴巴喊不出“毛主席万岁！”为这，她不知痛苦地流过多少眼泪。
    今年三月，解放军三○一六部队毛泽东思想医疗宣传队来到聋哑学校，给聋哑同学扎针治病，宣传毛泽东思想。无限忠于毛主席的中国人民解放军，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想打开了聋哑“禁区”，使聋哑同学喊出了多年想喊而喊不出的“毛主席万岁！”唱出了昼夜想唱而唱不出的《东方红》。
    王玉海听着聋哑了十七年的女儿清楚地高唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。”旧社会的辛酸和新社会的幸福，一齐涌上了他的心头，眼泪刷刷地往下掉。
    王玉海老家在山东，一九三八年，他全家被地主逼得死的死，亡的亡，剩下他一个人逃到辽源煤矿又被迫给资本家卖苦力。谁知逃出虎穴又入狼窝，差一点被资本家投进炼人炉。幸亏毛主席指挥解放军解放了东北，才把他从虎口里救了出来。解放后，他四十多岁才结婚，生了个女儿。没想到雅琴三岁得病成了哑巴。今天，又是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军，使这些哑巴孩子说了话。……
    王玉海越想越激动。他把女儿拉到毛主席像前说：“雅琴呀，你今天会唱毛主席是咱的大救星，你还要知道毛主席是怎样搭救的咱呀！多少年来，我想给你说说旧社会的苦，新社会的甜，你就是听不到。今天，毛主席又给了你一双好耳朵，一张好嘴巴，爹可该多说几句哩！”接着，王玉海把多少年来压在心底的话一齐兜了出来。最后，他指着毛主席像说：“孩子，毛主席是咱的大救星，咱就是要永远高唱《东方红》啊！从今天起，你要教我，爹也要学唱《东方红》。”王雅琴知道爸爸由于在旧社会受的劳累，说句话都气喘得厉害，要唱歌就更困难了。就问爸爸：“你有病能唱吗？”王玉海坚定地说：“你们哑巴孩子都能唱，我咋不能唱？唱着《东方红》我心里舒服。”
    就这样，王雅琴每天放学回家都教父亲唱《东方红》。这位连说话都很困难的老退休工人，硬是学会了唱《东方红》。从这以后，王玉海家里，天天不断《东方红》的歌声。
