The recent storm of dumping paper currency and rushing to buy gold in the capitalist world has intensified, severely impacting major capitalist countries already mired in financial crisis. The foreign exchange, gold, and stock markets in Western Europe and the United States have fallen into chaos. The capitalist world currency system, which was already severely hit and on the brink of collapse during the crisis in the spring, is once again teetering on the edge of collapse.

Since the wave of dumping paper currency and buying gold in Western Europe and the United States reached a new peak on the 15th, the financial giants of various major Western countries hastily gathered in Basel, Switzerland, for a two-day secret meeting on the 16th. They announced that they would jointly take measures to deal with the current crisis. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou also gave a televised speech on the 18th, claiming that other Western countries would provide France with "unreserved support" while again guaranteeing that the franc would not be devalued. However, none of this had the effect of calming nerves or stabilizing the market. Instead, the frenzy of dumping the franc, pound, and dollar, and buying gold and the West German mark continued to escalate, reaching a frenzied level on the 19th. Due to the intensity of the selling, the Bank of France and the Bank of England had to painfully sell large amounts of foreign exchange to buy back the franc and pound to prevent their exchange rates from falling too sharply. The United Press International reported on the 19th, "The financial crisis in the Western world is rapidly becoming uncontrollable."

Faced with this situation, the German and French governments both ordered the foreign exchange market to close for three days starting on the 20th; France also announced the suspension of stock and gold trading. Major financial centers in Western Europe, except for Zurich, as well as some foreign exchange markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, also announced closures ranging from one to three days starting on the 20th. However, even with the suspension of foreign exchange trading, the frenzied selling and buying could not be stopped. On the 20th, gold prices rose across the board. In London, gold prices briefly soared to $42 per ounce (the official price was $35 per ounce). Additionally, merchants rushed to buy large quantities of platinum, silver, and other precious metals, as well as important commodities and securities, causing turmoil in the commodity and stock markets.

This rapidly developing crisis storm has left the major capitalist countries led by the U.S. in a state of panic. The financial giants of these countries held another emergency meeting in Bonn on the 20th to discuss countermeasures. However, it was revealed that there were deep-seated contradictions and heated arguments among them. Some Western "financial experts" anxiously admitted that the current situation is even more precarious than it was in the spring. This is because, in addition to the dollar and pound, the franc is also under severe pressure from the crisis storm; any one of these three major currencies in the capitalist world failing to hold out could trigger a chain reaction.

    西方抛售纸币抢购黄金风潮越刮越猛
    摇摇欲坠的资本主义世界货币体系再次濒临崩溃边缘
    新华社二十一日讯　最近爆发的资本主义世界抛售纸币、抢购黄金的新风暴连日来越刮越猛，有力地冲击着深陷在金融危机中的各主要资本主义国家，使西欧和美国的外汇、黄金和股票市场陷入了一片混乱。早在今年春季的危机风暴中就已经遭到沉重打击、摇摇欲坠的资本主义世界货币体系，如今再一次濒临崩溃的边缘。
    自从西欧和美国各金融中心抛售纸币、抢购黄金的风潮在十五日达到新的高峰以后，西方各主要国家的金融巨头慌忙在十六日聚集到瑞士巴塞尔举行了两天秘密会议，并且放出空气，说它们将共同采取措施来应付当前的危机风暴；法国总理德姆维尔也在十八日发表电视讲话，一面扬言其他西方国家保证给予法国“无保留的支持”，一面再次保证法郎不会贬值。但是这一切都没有能够起到安定人心、稳定市场的作用。相反，抛售法郎、英镑和美元，抢购黄金和西德马克的狂热仍然有增无已，在十九日达到了疯狂的程度。由于抛风过于猛烈，法兰西银行和英格兰银行这一天都不得不忍痛抛出大笔外汇来买进法郎和英镑，以免它们的比价下跌得太大。合众国际社在十九日的报道中惊呼，“西方世界的金融危机正在迅速地变得无法控制”。
    面对着这种局势，西德和法国官方分别在二十日下令外汇市场停业三天；法国同时还宣布暂停股票和黄金交易。西欧除苏黎世以外的重要金融中心以及非洲、中东和东南亚的一些外汇市场也都纷纷宣布从二十日起分别停业一至三天。但是，外汇交易虽然暂停，却仍然未能制止疯狂的抛风和抢风。就在二十日这一天，各地金价普遍上涨。在伦敦，金价一度涨到了每盎斯四十二美元的高峰（官价是三十五美元一盎斯），此外，商人还大批抢购白金、白银等贵重金属及其他重要商品和有价证券，引起了商品市场和股票市场的混乱。
    这场迅速发展的危机风暴使以美帝为首的西方各主要资本主义国家惊慌不安。这些国家的金融巨头二十日再一次聚集到波恩举行紧急会议，商讨对策。但是，据透露，会上彼此间矛盾重重，吵得不可开交。一些西方“金融专家”忧心忡忡地承认，目前的局势甚至比今年春天还要险恶。因为现在除美元、英镑外，又加上了法郎一共是三种资本主义世界的主要货币正在同时受到危机风暴的猛烈冲击；它们之中的任何一个抵挡不住的话都可能引起连锁反应。
