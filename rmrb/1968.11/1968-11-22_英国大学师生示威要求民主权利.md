Hundreds of British arts students and teachers marched in London on November 20th to the Department of Education and Science of the Wilson government to protest against the dismissal of some teachers in arts colleges and to demand democratic rights for teachers and students to manage schools.

The marchers set off from the Royal Academy of Arts. Among the participants were some lecturers who had been dismissed by the administration of Guilford College of Arts. It is reported that since this summer, the college has dismissed 33 part-time teachers and 7 full-time teachers.

Many protesters condemned the deteriorating educational situation and demanded the reinstatement of all dismissed teachers and staff, and demanded that teachers and students have representatives to participate in school management.

On the same day, about 1,000 students from four colleges in Liverpool marched through the city center, demanding that students have representatives to participate in school management.

On the 19th, about 300 students at the University of Dijon occupied part of the campus to protest the lack of facilities.

    英国大学师生示威要求民主权利
    新华社伦敦二十一日电　好几百名英国文科学生和教师二十日在这里举行示威游行，前往威尔逊政府的教育和科学部，抗议一些文科院校解雇教职员，要求教职员和学生有管理学校的民主权利。
    示威队伍从皇家文学院出发。参加示威游行的有一些是被吉尔福德文学院院方无理解雇的讲师。据报道，自从今年夏天以来，这个学院已经有三十三名兼任教师和七名专职教师被解雇。
    许多示威者谴责教育状况进一步恶化，并且要求让失去工作的全体教职员复职，要求教职员和学生有代表参加管理学校。
    同一天，在利物浦也有四个学院的约一千名学生列队游行，穿过市中心，要求学生有派代表参加管理学校的权利。
    十九日，狄戎大学的大约三百名学生占领了一部分校园，抗议学校缺乏设备。
