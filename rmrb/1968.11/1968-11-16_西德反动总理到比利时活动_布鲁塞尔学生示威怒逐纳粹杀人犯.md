West German Reactionary Chancellor Visits Belgium
Brussels Students Protest Against Nazi Murderer

	BRUSSELS, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Youths in Brussels staged another protest on November 14, denouncing the visit of West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger to Belgium and opposing West German militarism.

About 100 students from the University of Brussels held a rally on the main road to the airport, protesting against his visit to Belgium, forcing this head of West German militarism to sneak to the airport under heavy police protection. Earlier, some protesters had tried to break into the hotel where Kiesinger was staying, shouting, "Kiesinger is a murderer!" despite police suppression.

	On November 13, more than 100 youths in Brussels held a similar protest.
