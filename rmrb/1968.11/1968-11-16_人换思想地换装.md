	Changing Minds, Changing Lands
	In the village of Xifangshen Brigade, Niutoupu Commune, Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province, lies a village along the banks of the Liao River. In the old society, this place was a poor area where "highlands grew tall grasses and lowlands were filled with frog croaks." After liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, firmly took the road of collectivization. They responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," relying on their own efforts and striving hard, determined to dig out all the wild grass, bury the graves deeply, achieve field leveling, and completely change the backward appearance.

	The tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution exposed the class struggle in Xifangshen Brigade. A handful of class enemies fiercely opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sabotaged the field leveling.

	One day, 63-year-old Grandpa Jiang was working when he heard a bad element inciting, "This time everything has to be turned over and looked at, field leveling is digging graves and exhuming corpses, it's unheard of." Grandpa Jiang got so angry upon hearing this that he immediately retorted.

	That night, Grandpa Jiang used Chairman Mao's teaching, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution," to analyze a series of events in the production team. He realized that the class enemies' sabotage of field leveling was a resistance to the poor and lower-middle peasants following Chairman Mao's Dazhai path. Thus, Grandpa Jiang convened a family meeting late at night to criticize. At the meeting, Grandpa Jiang recalled how he was forced to work for the landlord for 38 years in the old society and suffered greatly. He angrily criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and exposed the crimes of a handful of class enemies in sabotaging the Cultural Revolution and opposing field leveling. His speech aroused the family's intense hatred towards Liu Shaoqi and his gang. The next day, Grandpa Jiang reported to the brigade cadres. Under the leadership of the brigade cadres, the whole family mobilized, visiting households east and west, rallying the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

	The class enemies' counterattack was repulsed, and a new battle to change heaven and earth began amidst the tumultuous revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy. Grandpa Jiang was the first to participate in the battle to reclaim the yellow earth pits. Everyone saw that he was old and advised him, "Carrying soil is too tiring, you should go select bean seeds!" He said, "Chairman Mao has long said, 'Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to bear it.' Although I am old, in building a new socialist countryside, I should also contribute more effort to express my loyalty to Chairman Mao!"

	Grandpa Jiang was not only a pioneer in changing heaven and earth and attacking the enemy but also a vanguard in changing customs, breaking old ideas, and old habits. The fourth team dug an irrigation ditch that had to pass through his ancestral graves. Upon hearing this, he moved the graves without a word. Soon, the ditch changed course and had to be dug again through his newly moved graves. He moved the graves again. A few months later, the brigade planned to build a road, and it happened to pass through his newly relocated graves. He prepared to move the graves again. This time, his 81-year-old mother found out and angrily said, "One grave, you move it east and west, even the dead are moved by you." Grandpa Jiang smiled and said to his old mother, "In the past, we believed in gods and ghosts, and our ancestors were poor. Now we believe in socialism and are extremely happy. As long as socialism needs it, moving it twice or three times is nothing. This is all because I lack thorough revolutionary spirit. If I had buried it deeply at the beginning, there would be no problem at all!" The next morning, he called his son up early and buried the grave deeply. Grandpa Jiang's revolutionary actions deeply educated everyone, and all the graves in the village were deeply buried, expanding the cultivated land by more than 200 mu.

　　人换思想地换装
    辽宁省辽中县牛心坨公社西房身大队，是一个紧靠辽河岸边的村庄。在旧社会，这里是“高地长茅草，洼地蛤蟆叫”的穷地方。解放后，广大贫下中农在党和毛主席的英明领导下，坚定地走集体化道路，并且响应毛主席提出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，决心挖尽茅草荒，深葬坟墓，实现方田化，彻底改变落后面貌。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了西房身大队阶级斗争的盖子。一小撮阶级敌人疯狂反对无产阶级文化大革命，破坏方田化。
    一天，六十三岁的姜大爷正在干活，听到一个坏分子煽动说：“这回什么都得翻过来看，搞方田化是掘墓扒坟，伤天害理。”姜大爷一听就气坏了，立刻给他顶了回去。
    晚上，姜大爷用毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，分析了生产队发生的一系列事情，认识到阶级敌人破坏方田化，就是反对贫下中农跟毛主席走大寨的道路。于是，姜大爷召集全家深夜开了个批判会。会上，姜大爷回忆了他在旧社会被迫给地主扛活三十八年受的苦，愤怒地批判了大叛徒刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，揭露了一小撮阶级敌人破坏文化大革命，反对搞方田化的罪行。他的发言激起了全家人对刘少奇及其一伙的无比仇恨。第二天，姜大爷向大队干部作了汇报，在大队干部领导下，全家人都出动，走东家，串西家，发动群众向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。
    阶级敌人的反扑被打退了，一场新的改天换地的战斗，在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判和对敌斗争中开始了。姜大爷第一个参加了大战黄土坑的战斗。大家见他年纪大，劝他说：“挑土太累，你选豆种去吧！”他却说：毛主席早就讲了：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”我的年纪虽然大了，在建设社会主义新农村中，也要多出一把力气，表示我忠于毛主席的一点心意！
    姜大爷不仅是改天换地、进攻敌人的闯将，还是移风易俗，大破旧思想、旧习惯的先锋。四队挖一条排水渠，要通过他家坟地，他听说后，二话没说，就把坟移走了。不久，水渠改道，又要挖到他刚移的新坟地，他又把坟移走了。没过几个月，大队计划修一条道，赶巧又要通过他新挪的坟地。他又准备移坟。这次，被他八十一岁的老母亲知道了，生气地说：“一个坟，你东搬西搬，死的都让你给搬活了。”姜大爷笑着对老母亲说：“过去咱信神信鬼祖辈穷，现在咱信社会主义，无比幸福。只要社会主义需要，移两次三次算个啥。这都怪我没有彻底革命精神，当初要是深葬，不就什么事也没有啦！”第二天一早，他就把儿子叫起来，进行了深葬。姜大爷的革命行动，深刻地教育了大家，全村的坟墓都进行了深葬，扩大耕地面积二百多亩。
