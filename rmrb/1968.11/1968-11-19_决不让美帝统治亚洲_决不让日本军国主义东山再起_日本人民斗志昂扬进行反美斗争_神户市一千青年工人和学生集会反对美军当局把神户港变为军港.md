	Never Allow the U.S. Empire to Rule Asia; Never Allow Japanese Militarism to Rise Again
	Japanese People's Fighting Spirit Soars as They Wage Anti-U.S. Struggle
	One Thousand Young Workers and Students in Kobe Hold Rally Opposing U.S. Military's Plan to Turn Kobe Port into a Military Port

	BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, 400 workers and students in Kitakyushu, Japan, held a rally in Fukuoka City on Nov. 16, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	A young speaker at the rally said: Recently, a U.S. military plane from the Patto base crashed again in the fields of Fukuoka Prefecture, committing the crime of destroying the property of the Japanese people. It is our most urgent and important task to wage a persistent and resolute struggle against the U.S. military bases in Japan. He exposed that the U.S. imperialism, driven to a dead end by the anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of Asian countries, is increasingly colluding with the Japanese reactionaries, plotting to use Asians to fight Asians. The Japanese pro-U.S. monopolistic capitalists, in cahoots with the U.S. imperialists, are attempting to realize their ambition of re-invading Asia. The Japanese people will never allow the U.S. empire to rule Asia and will never allow Japanese militarists to rise again. Amidst enthusiastic applause, the young speaker loudly read Chairman Mao's quotation about revolutionary youth having to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. He called on Japanese revolutionary youth and students to unite with the workers and peasants and wage a just patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism.

	The leader of the farmers' struggle against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, Mr. Tomura Ichisaku, also spoke at the rally. He said: The struggle of the farmers in Sanrizuka has already united with the struggle against the Patto U.S. military base in Kitakyushu. The anti-U.S. struggles that have erupted in various parts of Japan are gradually uniting. He also emphasized that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are currently becoming more brutal in suppressing the struggles of the Japanese people. However, this will only arouse the Japanese people to wage more intense revolutionary struggles. Although there will be many difficulties and hardships on our struggle path, our struggle has a bright future. The Japanese people will surely defeat the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	A representative of Tokyo University students, who have been persistently struggling against the reactionary and corrupt educational system, also spoke at the rally. The audience enthusiastically applauded in support of the students' struggle.

	According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, about 1,000 young workers and students in Kobe, Japan, held a rally in the Kobe City Hall Square on Nov. 15, opposing the U.S. military's plan to turn Kobe Port into a military port.

	At the rally, representatives of young workers and students unanimously condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in Japan and called on the people to persist in the struggle, smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and expel the U.S. military bases in Japan.

	One young speaker emphasized: "We must learn and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war in our struggle, mobilize the broad masses of the Japanese people, and carry our anti-U.S. struggle to the final victory; and closely link it with the national liberation struggles of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

    一位青年在会上讲话说：从板付基地起飞的美军飞机最近再次坠毁在福冈县的田园里，犯下了毁坏日本人民财产的罪行。进行持久的和坚决的反对驻日美军基地的斗争，是我们的最迫切和最重要的任务。他揭露说，被亚洲各国人民的反美斗争逼得走投无路的美帝国主义，越来越加紧同日本反动派勾结，阴谋用亚洲人来打亚洲人。而日本的亲美垄断资本同美帝狼狈为奸，企图实现其重新侵略亚洲的野心。日本人民决不让美帝统治亚洲，决不让日本军国主义分子东山再起。这位青年在热烈的掌声中高声朗读了毛主席关于革命青年必须实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块的语录。并且号召日本的革命青年和学生同工农群众团结起来，进行反美爱国正义斗争。

    一直在不屈不挠地进行着反对反动腐朽教育制度的斗争的东京日本大学学生代表也在会上发言。人们以热烈的掌声表示支持学生们的斗争。
