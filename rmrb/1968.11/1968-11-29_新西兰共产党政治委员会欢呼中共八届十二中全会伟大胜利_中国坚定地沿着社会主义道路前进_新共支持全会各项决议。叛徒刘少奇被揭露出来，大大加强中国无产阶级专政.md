The Political Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand issued a statement in the November 27 issue of the "Voice of the People" weekly, warmly hailing the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great victory of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The statement said: "On the international stage, there is a fierce struggle between two great forces. One force represents the working people and oppressed people of the world. The other force represents the exploiters and oppressors."

The statement said: "Revolutionary China, under the leadership of the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao Zedong, stands at the forefront of the struggle of all exploited classes and oppressed nations. The alliance of exploiters and traitors to socialism is headed by the leaders of imperialism and the leaders of the Soviet revisionists.

"The struggle between these two completely opposed forces is taking place in every country in the world, including New Zealand. Every victory achieved by the revolutionary socialist forces and the forces of national liberation is a victory for the working class and the oppressed people of New Zealand over the enemies of the people."

The statement emphasized: "For this reason, the Political Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand hails the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which enables China to continue to advance firmly along the revolutionary socialist road, opposing all attempts to restore capitalism from within and without."

The statement pointed out that the plot of the number one revisionist in China, Liu Shaoqi, to restore capitalism has been thoroughly smashed by the Chinese revolutionary workers and peasants under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China. This is a victory for the working people of all countries.

The statement said that during the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people exposed Liu Shaoqi as a traitor to socialism and the working people. The exposure of Liu Shaoqi has greatly strengthened and consolidated the proletarian dictatorship in China.

The statement said that the Political Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand supports the decision of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and other decisions.

After emphasizing the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China for preventing the restoration of capitalism, the statement pointed out that the ideology of the broad masses of the Chinese people is firmly based on the Marxist-Leninist thought developed by Chairman Mao Zedong to a new stage. This ideology will defeat capitalist ideology and revisionist ideology.

The statement concluded by saying that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that socialism is invincible.

    新西兰共产党政治委员会欢呼中共八届十二中全会伟大胜利
    中国坚定地沿着社会主义道路前进
    新共支持全会各项决议。叛徒刘少奇被揭露出来，大大加强中国无产阶级专政
    新华社惠灵顿二十七日电　新西兰共产党政治委员会二十七日在《人民之声》周报上发表一项声明，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的伟大胜利。
    声明说：“在国际舞台上，两大势力之间正在进行着剧烈的搏斗。其中一种势力代表着世界劳动人民和被压迫人民。另一种势力代表着剥削者和压迫者。”
    声明说：“革命的中国，在当代的列宁——毛泽东主席的领导下，站在一切被剥削阶级和被剥削民族斗争的前列。而剥削者同社会主义的叛徒的联盟则是由帝国主义的头子们和苏修的头子们带头的。
    “这两种完全对立的势力之间的斗争，正在世界各国进行着，其中包括新西兰。革命的社会主义力量和民族解放力量所取得的每一个胜利，都是新西兰工人阶级和被剥削人民对人民的敌人的胜利。”
    声明强调说：“正因为如此，新西兰共产党政治委员会欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，它使中国继续坚定地沿着革命的社会主义道路前进，反对从内部和外部使中国复辟资本主义的种种企图。”
    声明指出，中国头号修正主义分子刘少奇复辟资本主义的阴谋，已被毛泽东主席和中国共产党英明领导下的中国革命工人、农民彻底粉碎了。这是各国劳动人民的胜利。
    声明说，中国人民在文化大革命中揭露出刘少奇早就是社会主义和劳动人民的叛徒。刘少奇的被揭露大大地加强和巩固了中国的无产阶级专政。
    声明说，新西兰共产党政治委员会支持中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会关于永远开除刘少奇出党的决定和其他决定。
    声明在强调了中国无产阶级文化大革命对于防止资本主义复辟的伟大意义后指出，中国广大人民群众的思想是牢固地建立在由毛泽东主席发展到新阶段的马克思列宁主义思想的基础上的。这种思想将战胜资本主义思想，战胜修正主义思想。
    声明最后说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命表明，社会主义是不可战胜的。
