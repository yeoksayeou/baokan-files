The pro-American Sato reactionary government is conspiring to enact a new law to restrict the normal activities of Chinese visitors in Japan. This is a new step by Sato Eisaku in following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, in hostility towards China, and in disrupting friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

According to a report in the Asahi Shimbun on the 18th, the Japanese Ministry of Justice will submit a new "Law on Control of Immigration and Emigration" to the next session of the Diet.

According to the report, the Sato government can use this law to arbitrarily "issue warnings to, and even expel, Chinese visitors." The Asahi Shimbun also revealed that if the Diet passes this law, "Chinese delegations coming to Japan for economic or cultural exchanges, if they criticize the Japanese government's policies at a welcome reception or lecture, this alone would constitute a violation of the Law on Control of Immigration and Emigration. Furthermore, meetings held by Japanese individuals related to this delegation, or their freedom of speech, may also be restricted." This means that once this new reactionary law is enacted, the Sato government will be able to more brazenly fabricate excuses to restrict and disrupt the normal activities of Chinese visitors, and to carry out fascist suppression against the broad masses of the Japanese people engaged in Sino-Japanese friendly activities.

For many years, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have made disrupting friendly exchanges and civilian trade between the Chinese and Japanese peoples an important part of their hostile policy towards China. Since Sato Eisaku came to power, he has intensified his anti-China stance, committing a series of reactionary acts and crimes. He has gone to Southeast Asia to collude with the U.S. imperialists' lackeys and puppets in anti-revolutionary conspiracies against socialist China; he has gone to China's sacred territory of Taiwan Province to conspire with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, who have been spat upon by the Chinese people; he has gone to Washington twice to conspire with his American masters to create "two Chinas" and further intensify anti-China activities; he has played the role of a jumping jack in the anti-China "holy alliance" concocted by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. It is clear that the so-called new scheme to restrict the activities of Chinese visitors prepared by the Japanese Ministry of Justice for the next session of the Diet is a new step taken by the Sato government in its path of enmity towards the Chinese people and disruption of friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

The Sato government's further intensified anti-China actions have aroused strong indignation among the broad masses of the Japanese people and the Sino-Japanese friendly trade circles. They are taking action to oppose this reactionary new law. The Sato reactionary government's intensified anti-China actions will not enable it to escape its internal and external predicaments; on the contrary, they will only hasten its downfall.

    阴谋制定新法案限制中国访日人员在日本的正常活动
    佐藤反动政府追随美帝苏修加紧反华
    激起了日本广大人民和日中友好贸易界的强烈愤慨
    新华社二十二日讯  东京消息：亲美的佐藤反动政府正在阴谋制定新法案，限制中国访日人员在日本的正常活动。这是佐藤荣作追随美帝、苏修，敌视中国，破坏中日人民友好往来的新步骤。
    据《朝日新闻》十八日透露，日本法务省将向下一届国会提出新的“出入国管理法案”。
    据报道，佐藤政府根据这个法案可以对中国访日人员任意“提出警告，一直到勒令离境和驱逐出境”。《朝日新闻》还透露，如果国会通过了这一法案，那么，“由中国来日本进行经济或文化交流的代表团，只要在欢迎酒会或讲演会上批评一下日本政府的政策，仅这一点，就构成违反出入国管理法。不仅如此，同这个代表团有关的日本人本身所举行的集会或他们的言论自由，也有可能受到制约”。这就是说，这项新的反动法案一经成立，佐藤政府就可以更加肆无忌惮地制造借口，限制和破坏中国访日人员的正常活动，并且对从事日中友好活动的日本广大人民进行法西斯镇压。
    多年来，美日反动派一直把破坏中日人民友好往来和中日民间贸易作为它们敌视中国政策的一个重要组成部分。佐藤荣作上台后，更是变本加厉地反华，干出了一系列反动勾当，犯下了滔天罪行。他曾到东南亚，同美帝的仆从和傀儡进行反对社会主义中国的反革命串连；他跑到中国的神圣领土台湾省去活动，同早已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石匪帮紧密勾结；他两次到华盛顿，同其美国主子密谋制造“两个中国”和进一步加紧反华活动；他扮演着美帝、苏修拼凑的反华“神圣同盟”中的跳梁小丑的角色。很明显，日本法务省准备向下届国会提出的限制中国访日人员活动的所谓新方案，是佐藤政府在与中国人民为敌、破坏中日人民友好往来的道路上迈出的新步伐。
    佐藤政府进一步反华的恶劣行径，激起了日本广大人民和日中友好贸易界的强烈愤慨。他们正在行动起来，反对这一反动的新法案。佐藤反动政府加紧反华，绝不能使它摆脱内外交困的窘境，相反，只能加速它的垮台。
