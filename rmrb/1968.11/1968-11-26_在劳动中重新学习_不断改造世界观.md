The Shantou City Environmental Sanitation Management Office's cadre, who were sent down to the grassroots, have integrated with the worker masses, and their spiritual outlook has undergone significant changes. The cadre sent down to Yulin Commune in Henan Province's Yanjin County have received re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants and have made progress in their ideological revolutionization.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 25th. Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, the Shantou City Environmental Sanitation Management Office Revolutionary Committee has earnestly grasped and timely resolved the various active thoughts of the cadre sent down to the grassroots, making them consciously accept the re-education of the working class in labor, continuously transform their worldview, and undergo significant changes in their spiritual outlook.

In early April this year, after the establishment of the Shantou City Environmental Sanitation Management Office Revolutionary Committee, 80% of the office's cadre were sent down to the grassroots to participate in labor. Most of these cadre performed well after being sent down to the grassroots, fearing neither dirt nor hard work, and integrating with the worker masses. Their ideological revolutionization has made significant progress. However, some cadre developed some active thoughts, such as feeling that the work of carrying manure buckets and pushing garbage carts is both dirty and smelly, and not as respectable as participating in other types of labor. Some old cadre of worker origin, who have returned to being sanitation workers, feared that others would think they were sent here to do this work because they had made mistakes, which was too shameful. The leftist cadres and the Revolutionary Committee analyzed these active thoughts and believed that it was necessary to correct these comrades' fundamental attitudes towards labor. They focused on this issue, mobilizing the cadre sent down to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and guiding them to recall the bitter history of the old society, think about today's happy life, and reflect on their own ideological changes after becoming cadre. They discussed the great significance of cadre being sent down to labor. In this way, the discussion meeting turned into a meeting of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and a meeting of criticizing bourgeois ideology, deeply touching the soul of each person. Some old cadre of sanitation worker origin talked about how, after becoming cadre, they had gradually drifted away from the masses and labor due to long-term detachment, and their feelings and thoughts had changed: what they once thought was fragrant, they now thought was smelly; what they once thought was glorious, they now felt was lowly, unknowingly slipping into the quagmire of revisionism. They said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre being sent down to labor are great measures to ensure that the broad cadre always keep their hearts connected with the masses, always maintain the character of ordinary laborers, and ensure that the proletarian heaven will never change color. We must carry out these instructions without any compromise. With their heightened awareness, their attitudes towards labor also changed. Those who previously had incorrect understandings of participating in labor now voluntarily request to go to their schools and offices to dig manure and clean garbage, going to the dirtiest and smelliest places to work, knocking off the "official" air in labor, and tempering their hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and wholeheartedly serve the people.

After the cadre had been sent down to labor for a period, the leftist cadres and the management office Revolutionary Committee mobilized them to use Chairman Mao's teachings on "We Communists are not seeking office but seeking revolution. We must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment be separated from the masses" as a weapon to further criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist cadre line. This ensured that after the cadre had made initial achievements in being sent down to labor and received praise from the masses, they continued to maintain a clear mind, overcome the thought of "having been tempered enough," recognize the long-term and arduous nature of ideological transformation, and heighten everyone's awareness of taking root at the grassroots, transforming their thoughts, and forever being ordinary laborers. Through these efforts, many cadre actively requested the leadership to allow them to stay at the grassroots as ordinary workers for life. Some even actively educated their family members to frequently participate in labor at the Environmental Sanitation Management Office, learning anew and accepting the re-education of the working class together with them in labor.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 25th. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadre of Yulin Commune in Henan Province's Yanjin County, with their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, have insisted on using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the cadre sent down, actively helping them learn anew in labor and make progress in their ideological revolutionization, achieving remarkable results.

In September this year, 124 cadre were sent down to Yulin Commune from the prefecture, county, and commune. They were housed in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants in 40 production brigades. As soon as these cadre arrived in the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadre, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "Never forget class struggle" and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions of "Not understanding what class is, not understanding what exploitation is, is not understanding revolution," promptly gave them class education and education on the two-line struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadre first took the cadre sent down to visit their village's class struggle exhibition hall. In the exhibition hall, old poor peasants pointed to the sticks used for begging in the past and the ragged clothes worn by several generations, angrily denouncing the evils of the old society; grassroots cadre pointed to the landlord's accounts of changing the sky and the murder weapons buried until today, bitterly criticizing the evil activities of the class enemies attempting to change the sky. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants also actively invited the cadre sent down to participate in their village's revolutionary criticism meetings against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and struggle meetings against a handful of class enemies, letting the cadre sent down temper a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao on the front line of class struggle. An original vice minister of the prefectural committee, after being sent down to labor, visited the class struggle exhibition hall and saw many materials about the poor and lower-middle peasants bravely fighting against the Japanese invaders, traitors, and landlords. He deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants had the highest class struggle and two-line struggle awareness. In the past, he had fought against the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang bandits, and landlords with the poor and lower-middle peasants, but now the poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle against the class enemies was more vigorous, while he had been sitting in the office for a long time, poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, and his revolutionary will had declined. From then on, he earnestly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, actively participated in the criticism meetings and struggle meetings organized by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and used his personal experiences to bitterly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. Under the help and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he made significant progress.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadre of this commune also used Chairman Mao's great teachings of "The broad cadre being sent down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, they should all do this. Cadre in office should also be sent down in batches to labor" and "Cadre, through participating in collective productive labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism" to help the cadre sent down deeply understand that cadre being sent down to labor is Chairman Mao's care and concern for the broad cadre, an important way for cadre to achieve ideological revolutionization, and thus more consciously transform their thoughts in labor. A female cadre sent down to Anle Brigade, after entering the village, generally worked diligently, but sometimes was afraid of getting dirty. Poor peasant Li Grandma took the initiative to study Chairman Mao's teachings with her, recall bitterness and think of sweetness together, and fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism together, giving her a profound education and making her realize that there was indeed a gap between her thoughts and feelings and those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Afterwards, she worked more actively and diligently, getting up early and going to bed late every day to carry baskets and pick manure, and also helping the livestock keeper to clean the manure and sweep the manure pits in her spare time, insisting on transforming herself in labor and taking a step forward on the road of ideological revolutionization.

In the process of being sent down to labor, some cadre could not put down their airs and had not shaken off the old style of "only being a commander, not a fighter." The poor and lower-middle peasants, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "being both an 'official' and an 'ordinary person,'" used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's revisionist black goods of wanting cadre to be officials and lords, and at the same time earnestly passing on the frugal style to the cadre sent down. An original vice secretary of the Yulin Commune Party Committee was a cadre of local worker and peasant origin. Due to the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist cadre line, he gradually developed the bad style of "being an official and a lord." This time, after being sent down to Chaoyang Brigade, he still could not put down his airs in labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants' association chairman of Chaoyang Brigade, who had been the peasant association chairman with him, had a heart-to-heart talk with him and together reviewed the teachings of Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" that they often studied when they were peasant association chairmen. The teachings of Chairman Mao and the severe criticism of the old comrade made this cadre realize his mistakes. Xue Xue Ran then gave him a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a hoe, encouraging him to always act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, never to leave the masses, never to leave labor, and never to forget his roots. This cadre later underwent significant changes.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadre of Yulin Commune, according to each cadre's strengths, assigned them appropriate work tasks, letting them be study guides for Chairman Mao's works, wall newspaper propagandists, newspaper correspondents, agricultural technicians, and art propaganda team guides, playing a role in the three great revolutionary movements. Every night, the cadre sent down and the poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's works together, jointly wrote revolutionary criticism articles, and rehearsed art programs, making the countryside bustling with activity. Those who had experience in rural work also studied with the grassroots cadre. In this way, the cadre sent down not only promoted their own ideological revolutionization but also made contributions to rural work.

    在劳动中重新学习　不断改造世界观
    汕头市环境卫生管理处下放干部同工人群众打成一片，精神面貌发生很大变化下放到河南省延津县于林公社的干部，接受贫下中农再教育，搞好思想革命化
    据新华社广州二十五日电　广东省汕头市环境卫生管理处革命委员会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，认真掌握并及时解决下放干部的各种活思想，使他们在劳动中自觉地接受工人阶级的再教育，不断改造自己的世界观，精神面貌发生了很大变化。
    今年四月初，汕头市环境卫生管理处革委会成立以后，抽出占全处百分之八十的干部下放到基层参加劳动。这些干部下放到基层后，绝大部分表现很好，在劳动中不怕脏不怕累，同工人群众打成一片，思想革命化有显著进步。也有些干部产生了些活思想，例如感到挑粪桶、推垃圾车的活又脏又臭，不如参加别的劳动体面；有的工人出身的老干部重新当上清洁工，怕别人以为自己是犯了错误才来干这种活的，太不光采。解放军支左人员和革委会分析了这些活思想，认为必须端正这些同志对待劳动的根本态度。他们就抓住这个问题，发动下放干部反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》，并引导大家忆旧社会的苦难史，思今天的幸福生活甜，想自己当了干部以后的思想变化，讨论干部下放劳动的重大意义。这样，讨论会变成了忆苦思甜会，变成了对资产阶级思想的批判会，深刻地触及了每个人的灵魂。有些清粪工人出身的老干部谈到，自己在当了干部以后，由于长期脱离群众，脱离劳动，思想感情起了变化：过去认为是香的，现在却认为是臭的；过去认为是光荣的，现在却感到是低贱的，不知不觉地往修正主义的泥坑里滑。他们说，毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示，是使广大干部永远和群众心连心，永远保持普通劳动者的本色，保证无产阶级江山永不变色的伟大措施，我们一定要不折不扣地执行。认识提高了，对待劳动的态度也变了。原来对参加劳动有不正确认识的同志，现在主动要求到自己学习和工作的学校、机关里去掏大粪，清垃圾，到最脏最臭的地方去干活，在劳动中打掉“官”气，磨练无限忠于毛主席、全心全意为人民服务的红心。
    支左人员和管理处革委会在干部下放劳动一段时间后，又发动下放干部以毛主席关于“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众”的教导为武器，进一步狠批刘少奇推行的修正主义干部路线，使下放干部在下放劳动取得初步成绩以后，在得到群众赞扬的情况下，继续保持清醒的头脑，克服锻炼得“差不多了”的思想，认识到思想改造的长期性和艰苦性，提高大家对扎根基层，改造思想，永当普通劳动者的自觉性。经过这些工作，许多下放干部积极要求领导让他们留在基层当一辈子普通工人，有的还积极教育自己的家属经常到环境卫生管理处参加劳动，和自己一起在劳动中重新学习，接受工人阶级的再教育。
    据新华社郑州二十五日电　河南省延津县于林公社广大贫下中农和基层干部，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情和强烈的革命责任感，坚持用战无不胜的毛泽东思想教育下放干部，积极帮助他们在劳动中重新学习，搞好思想革命化，取得了显著的效果。
    今年九月，陆续从专区、县、公社下放到于林公社一百二十四名干部。他们分住在四十个大队的贫下中农家里。这些干部一来到农村，贫下中农和基层干部就遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导和林副主席“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的指示，及时对他们进行阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育。贫下中农和基层干部首先把下放干部带到本村阶级斗争展览馆参观。在展览馆里，老贫农手指着过去逃荒要饭的棍子和穿了几代的破烂衣服，愤怒控诉了旧社会的罪恶；基层干部指着地主的变天账和埋藏到今天的杀人凶器，痛斥阶级敌人妄图变天的罪恶活动。广大贫下中农还主动找下放干部参加本村对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判会和对一小撮阶级敌人的斗争会，让下放干部在阶级斗争的第一线炼就一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心。原地委机关的一个副部长下放劳动后，参观了阶级斗争展览馆，看到展出的贫下中农同日本侵略军、汉奸、地主英勇斗争的许多材料，深深感到贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟最高，过去自己曾和贫下中农一道打日本侵略军、打蒋匪、斗地主，现在贫下中农那股敢于和阶级敌人斗争的革命精神越来越旺盛，而自己长期坐机关，受到刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的毒害，革命意志却衰退了。从此，他认真向贫下中农学习，积极参加贫下中农召开的批判会、斗争会，用自己的亲身经历，痛斥刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论。在贫下中农的帮助教育下，他有了不少进步。
    这个公社的广大贫下中农和基层干部，还用毛主席“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”和“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义”的伟大教导，来帮助下放干部深刻认识到，干部下放劳动，是毛主席对广大干部的爱护和关怀，是干部实现思想革命化的重要途径，从而更加自觉地在劳动中改造思想。下放到安乐庄大队的一个女干部，入村后劳动一般踏实，但有时干活怕脏。贫农李大娘就主动和她一起学习毛主席的教导，一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修，使她受到了深刻的教育，认识到自己同贫下中农的思想感情确实有一段距离。以后，她劳动更加积极踏实，天天起早搭晚背筐拾粪，还抽空帮助饲养员出圈粪，扫粪坑，坚持在劳动中改造自己，在思想革命化的道路上迈出了一步。
    在下放劳动的过程中，有的干部放不下架子，没有摆脱掉“光当指挥员，不当战斗员”的旧作风。贫下中农就遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇要干部做官当老爷的反革命修正主义黑货，同时认真把艰苦朴素的作风传给下放干部。原于林公社党委的一名副书记，是本乡工农出身的干部。由于受刘少奇修正主义干部路线的毒害，逐渐养成了“做官当老爷”的坏作风，这次下放到朝阳大队，劳动还是放不下架子。过去和他一块当农会主席的朝阳大队贫协主任刘学让就和他谈心，一起重温他们在当农会主席时常学的毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。毛主席的教导，老战友的严厉批评，使这个干部认识了自己的错误。刘学让又送给他《毛主席语录》和一把锄头，鼓励他永远照毛主席的指示办事，永不脱离群众，永不脱离劳动，永不忘本。这个干部后来有了很大转变。
    于林公社广大贫下中农和基层干部根据每个下放干部的特长，给他们分配适当的工作任务，让他们当毛主席著作学习辅导员，墙报宣传员，党报通讯员，农业技术员，文艺宣传队辅导员，在三大革命运动中发挥作用。每到夜晚，下放干部和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，共同写革命大批判文章，排练文艺节目，把农村搞得热气腾腾。有农村工作经验的同志还和基层干部一起研究工作。这样，使下放干部既促进了自己的思想革命化，又对农村工作作出了贡献。
