Wide areas of the country have created advanced experiences in solving the problem of potato degeneration.

The vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary scientific workers in our country have adhered to the policy of self-reliance, and have cultivated many new varieties. This has created the conditions for achieving complete local seed preservation of potatoes throughout the country, changing the previous situation of northern seed and southern adjustment.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 22nd, the vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary scientific workers in our country have adhered to the policy of self-reliance, solved the problem of potato degeneration, and created the conditions for achieving complete local seed preservation of potatoes throughout the country, changing the previous situation of northern seed and southern adjustment.

Solving the problem of potato degeneration and achieving local seed preservation is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "Prepare for War, Prepare for Famine, Serve the People" and further developing potato production. Potatoes originally grow in high-cold regions and have the characteristic of liking cold and fearing heat. In the past, except for the potatoes planted in the Northeast and the northern part of Inner Mongolia, which did not degenerate and could be locally preserved, the potatoes planted in the central and southern regions of our country all had serious degeneration problems and could not be locally preserved. Therefore, every year, more than twenty provinces and cities had to go to the distant Northeast to obtain seeds, causing a great waste of national manpower and material resources. Solving the problem of potato degeneration and achieving local seed preservation can not only reduce the national transportation burden but also timely select excellent varieties suitable for local conditions, expand the area of potato planting, and develop potato production.

The problem of preventing potato degeneration has been studied by many countries for more than a hundred years without solution; the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roaders Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the scientific and technological field, as well as some bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," have tried all kinds of "foreign" methods without success. However, in many places in our country, farmers with practical experience have solved this problem of great significance as early as several decades ago. The "Jieshou Red Skin" variety of potatoes planted by farmers in Jieshou County, Anhui, has not degenerated for nearly forty years due to the adoption of double-cropping, seed selection, and careful cultivation methods. The "Fushan Red Skin" variety of potatoes in the Yantai area of Shandong has been maintained for more than forty years without degeneration by adopting the same methods.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and his crawling philosophy, and severely criticized the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" for their theories of "potato degeneration cannot be solved" and "local seed preservation is not economical." They pushed the scientific experiments to prevent potato degeneration forward. The vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants in Fengzhen County, Ulanqab League, southern Inner Mongolia, on the basis of previous scientific experiments, carried out new varieties of sexual hybridization and sexual reproduction cultivation of potatoes, all of which have significant effects of disease resistance, degeneration resistance, and increased production. Moreover, the hybrid seedlings have great potential for increased production generation after generation. The relevant departments of Zhengzhou City, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If they are denied, then the revolution is denied," respected the pioneering spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants, formed a scientific experimental team with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, continued some scientific experiments that had already begun in some communes and production brigades, created a set of effective measures to control the degeneration of local potatoes, and cultivated some new varieties of potatoes suitable for double-cropping in Zhengzhou. This not only completely changed the previous situation of going to other places to introduce seeds every year but also sent out seeds to support other regions. The revolutionary scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, following Chairman Mao's teaching that intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants, walked out of the laboratory, went deep into the fields, and learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They summarized the rich experiences of preventing potato degeneration and achieving local seed preservation created by the vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants in our country.

In order to promote the advanced experience of preventing potato degeneration and achieving local seed preservation, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently held a national on-site exchange meeting on the experience of local seed preservation of potatoes in Yantai, Shandong.

    落实毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，促进生产发展
    全国各地创造了解决马铃薯退化问题的先进经验
    广大贫下中农和革命科学工作者坚持自力更生方针，培育出很多新品种，为在全国范围内做到马铃薯全部就地留种，改变过去北种南调状况创造了条件
    据新华社济南二十二日电　我国广大贫下中农和革命的科学工作者，坚持自力更生的方针，解决了马铃薯退化问题，为在全国范围内做到马铃薯全部就地留种，改变过去北种南调的状况创造了条件。
    解决马铃薯退化问题，做到就地留种，对于落实毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，进一步发展马铃薯生产，意义很大。马铃薯原生长在高寒地区，具有喜凉怕热的特性。过去我国除东北和内蒙古北部地区种植的马铃薯不退化，能够就地留种以外，在中部和南部地区种植的马铃薯都存在着严重退化现象，不能就地留种，因此，每年都有二十几个省市，要到遥远的东北调种，造成国家人力和物力的极大浪费。解决马铃薯退化问题，做到就地留种，不仅可以减轻国家运输负担，还可以适时选用适合当地条件的优良品种，扩大马铃薯种植面积，发展马铃薯生产。
    防止马铃薯退化的问题，许多国家搞了一百多年都没有解决；跟在帝、修、反屁股后面爬行的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他在科学技术界的代理人以及一些资产阶级反动学术“权威”，用尽了“洋”办法，也没有解决。而我国好多地方有实践经验的农民，早在几十年前就解决了这个具有重大意义的问题。安徽界首县农民种植的“界首红皮”品种，由于采用了二季栽培和棵选、个选以及精心栽培的办法，这个品种的马铃薯不退化已有近四十年的历史。山东烟台地区采用了同样的办法，使一种名为“福山红皮”的马铃薯，保持四十多年不退化。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线和他的爬行哲学，狠批资产阶级反动学术“权威”的“马铃薯退化无法解决”论和“就地留种不合算”论，把防止马铃薯退化的科学实验又向前推进了一步。地处内蒙古南部的乌兰察布盟丰镇县广大贫下中农，在以前进行科学实验的基础上，对马铃薯实行有性杂交和有性繁殖培育的新品种，均具有抗病、抗退化、增产的显著效果，而且杂交的实生苗，代代都有很大的增产潜力。郑州市有关部门遵循毛主席“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命”的教导，尊重贫下中农的首创精神，组成了一支以贫下中农为主体的科学实验队伍，继续进行一些社、队贫下中农早已开始的科学试验，创造了一整套控制当地马铃薯退化的有效措施，培育了一些适宜郑州双季栽培的马铃薯新品种，不仅彻底改变了过去年年到外地引种的状况，而且还调出种子支援了别的地区。中国科学院遗传研究所的革命科学工作者按照毛主席的知识分子必须同工农相结合的教导，走出实验大楼，深入田间地头，拜贫下中农为师，走与工农相结合的道路，重点总结了我国广大贫下中农创造的丰富的防止马铃薯退化，实行就地留种的经验。
    为了推广防止马铃薯退化，实行就地留种的先进经验，最近农业部和中国科学院在山东烟台市召开了全国马铃薯就地留种经验交流现场会。
