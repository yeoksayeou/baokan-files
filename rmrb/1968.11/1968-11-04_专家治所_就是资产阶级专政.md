The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the scientific research system, standing on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, frantically advocate the "one-man management" system and "expert rule," vigorously promoting the idea of "especially relying on managers, engineers, and technicians." This is essentially to allow a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and bourgeois "authorities" to monopolize the power over production and technology, to usurp the workers' power, and to restore capitalism. The capitalist-roaders in our institute, following the orders of their black masters, put together a reactionary clique mainly composed of traitors, spies, capitalist-roaders, reactionary capitalists, and reactionary academic "authorities," seizing control over the entire institute's administration, technical research, and publishing. The working class, the true masters of scientific research, were deprived of their right to participate in scientific research. The entire institute became a reactionary "independent kingdom" that was impervious to any influence.

These elements ruthlessly excluded and suppressed the workers. In 1960, under the direct instructions of Comrade Ke Qingshi, several technicians were promoted from among the workers. However, soon after, the capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" slandered the worker technicians as "stupid" and "having no future," driving them out one by one. They also used revisionist methods to lure many young technicians down the path of "detachment from politics, detachment from the masses, and detachment from production practice."

This gang of elements dared to resist and refuse to accept projects assigned by the proletarian headquarters. They refused to take on any projects that did not exist abroad or that did not bring fame and profit, pursuing "liberalization" instead. Over the past decade, they followed the path of Western bourgeoisie, copied Western bourgeois books, and squandered a large amount of state funds, causing immense losses. For example, a capitalist-roader and a reactionary academic "authority" in our institute, in an attempt to make a name for themselves, shut themselves away with a few engineers and technicians to build a "vacuum steel belt test furnace." After five years, due to poor design and impracticality, it became a "dead furnace."

In the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres in our steel research institute, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and launched a fierce attack on a small clique of class enemies through thorough revolutionary criticism. We fully utilized the form of "on-site criticism meetings," dragging the capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" to the site for criticism. We used the achievements of scientific research and trials to refute and criticize their fallacies of "expert rule" and "technology first," as well as their "crawling philosophy" and "slave philosophy." The "vacuum steel belt test furnace" that the capitalist-roader and reactionary academic "authority" failed to complete in five years was revived by us in just over a month. After the trial succeeded, we dragged them to the furnace for criticism. These two elements were stunned into silence by the ironclad facts and had to admit their guilt.

Through the in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, not only was the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the workers in scientific research greatly aroused, but it also promoted revolutionary technicians to resolutely take the path of combining with the workers. Our institute's revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the working class is the leading class," organized "three-in-one" small groups consisting of workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technicians for high, precise, and cutting-edge projects in scientific research and trials. With workers as the mainstay, we fully played the leading role of the working class, which is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to the proletarian revolutionary cause. This made the scientific research and trial work fast, tight, and good, producing results and creating miracles. In one workshop, several workers with an average educational level of primary school, who sought no fame or gain and worked only for Chairman Mao, successfully melted two high-grade products under difficult conditions and without proper equipment. They broke through the artificial barriers created by reactionary academic "authorities" in scientific research and experiments over many years, between ferrous and non-ferrous metals, through multiple trials and equipment improvements. The workers in the steelmaking workshop also successfully melted four high-grade products on ordinary electric furnaces in a short time, products that had never been mentioned in foreign textbooks and that reactionary academic "authorities" had never dared to imagine. The daily output also increased significantly. Especially under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions such as "the working class must lead everything," they only took a short time to surpass the path that Western bourgeoisie had taken for decades, successfully experimenting with a new steelmaking method, melting an alloy that is difficult to melt in alloys, and taking a victorious step forward on the road of industrial revolution.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line of "expert rule" has widespread poisonous influence and deep harm, especially in the minds of some people, particularly intellectuals, where it has formed a habitual force. Although "expert rule" has been severely criticized, class enemies are still making frantic comebacks, and its influence has yet to be thoroughly eliminated. All the revolutionary staff in our institute are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further eliminate the poisonous influence of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line of "expert rule," and to resolutely take the path of cultivating technicians from among the workers as exemplified by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. With the workshop as the base and workers as the mainstay, we will do a good job in the revolutionization of science and technology, and achieve new victories in revolution and scientific research and trials.

    “专家治所”就是资产阶级专政
    上海钢铁研究所　红钢兵
    叛徒刘少奇及其在科研系统的代理人，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，拚命鼓吹“一长制”和“专家治所”，大肆宣扬“要特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”。这实质上就是要由党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级“权威”垄断生产、技术大权，专工人阶级的政，复辟资本主义。我所走资派秉承其黑主子的旨意，拼凑了一个主要由叛徒、特务、走资派、反动资本家和反动学术“权威”组成的黑班子，统揽了全所行政、技术研究和出版的大权。科学研究的主人工人阶级被剥夺了参加科学研究的权利。整个所变成了水泼不进、针插不进的反动的“独立王国”。
    这些家伙，对工人施行残酷的排斥、打击。一九六○年，在柯庆施同志的直接指示下，曾经从工人中提拔了十几个技术员，可是没多久，走资派和反动学术“权威”就污蔑工人技术员“脑袋笨”、“没有培养前途”，把他们一个一个地排挤掉。他们还用修正主义的方法，诱骗不少年青的技术人员走上“脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离生产实践”的邪路。
    这帮家伙，对无产阶级司令部下达的项目，竟胆敢顽抗不接，凡外国没有的项目，凡没有名利的项目，他们统统不接，大搞“自由化”。十几年来，他们走外国资产阶级的路，抄外国资产阶级的书，挥霍了国家大量经费，造成极大损失。例如，我所一个走资派和一个反动学术“权威”为了一鸣惊人，撇开广大革命群众，找了几个工程师和技术人员关起门来造了一个“真空钢带试验炉”，用了五年时间，由于设计不切合实际，无法使用，成了一个“死炉子”。
    在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们钢研所广大工人同志和无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真地学习了毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻。我们充分利用了“现场批判会”的形式，把走资派、反动学术“权威”拉到现场进行批判，用科研、试制的成果驳斥和批判他们的“专家治所”、“技术第一”等等谬论和“爬行哲学”、“洋奴哲学”。那个走资派和反动学术“权威”五年没有搞成功的“真空钢带试验炉”，我们只用了一个多月的时间，就把它起死回生。试验成功后，把他们拉到炉前批判，这两个家伙被铁的事实驳得瞠目结舌，不得不低头认罪。
    由于开展了深入持久的革命大批判，不仅大大焕发出工人们在科学研究方面的积极性、主动性和创造性，而且促进了革命的技术人员坚决走与工人相结合的道路。我们钢研所的革命委员会，遵照毛主席“工人阶级是领导阶级”的教导，对科研、试制中高、精、尖的项目，组织了工人、革命干部和革命技术人员的“三结合”小组，以工人同志为主体，充分发挥了对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线、对无产阶级革命事业最忠的工人阶级的领导作用，这就使科研、试制工作抓得快，抓得紧，抓得好，出成果，创奇迹。一车间十几个平均文化程度只有小学水平的工人同志，他们不为名，不为利，一心只为毛主席争气。为了突击一项重要的工程，在条件设备差又无工艺的情况下，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，走我国自己发展科学技术的道路，打破了多年来资产阶级反动学术“权威”在科研、试验上人为地制造的黑色金属和有色金属的“界限”，经过多次试验和改进设备，熔炼成功两种高级的产品。炼钢车间的工人同志也在不长的时间内，在普通的电炉上，就试验熔炼出“洋本本”上从来没有过的，反动学术“权威”从来不敢想的四种高级产品，日产量也大幅度增长。尤其是在毛主席的“工人阶级必须领导一切”等一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，他们只用了很短的时间，就超过了外国资产阶级几十年所走的路程，试验成功一种新的炼钢方法，炼出了合金中很难熔炼的合金钢，在工业大革命的道路上向前迈出了胜利的一步。
    叛徒刘少奇的“专家治所”反动路线，流毒很广，贻害很深，在一些人特别是在知识分子的头脑中，已经形成一股习惯力量。现在，“专家治所”虽然遭到了严厉的批判，但是阶级敌人还要猖狂反扑，它的影响还待彻底肃清。我们全所广大革命职工，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步肃清叛徒刘少奇的“专家治所”反动路线的流毒，坚决走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，以车间为基点，以工人为主体，搞好科技工作革命化，夺取革命和科研、试制的新胜利。
