The farce of the U.S. presidential "election" staged by the American monopoly capitalist class this year has been strongly opposed by the broad masses of the American people from the very beginning. The people of various American cities have held large-scale demonstrations and marches, denouncing the "election" fraud and protesting against the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of American imperialism. This is unprecedented in American history and fully shows that the American people are rapidly awakening.

As early as this August, the Democratic and Republican parties, which are tools of the American monopoly capitalist class, held their "national conventions" in Chicago and Miami respectively to select presidential candidates. Electricians in Chicago and Miami went on strike, causing the two parties' "conventions" to encounter numerous difficulties even before they began.

On August 7, when the Republican Party's "convention" was being held in Miami, the broad black masses of Miami launched a fierce struggle against the Republican Party's "convention."

At the end of August, when the Democratic Party held its "convention" in Chicago, despite the fact that the reactionary ruling authorities in the United States had erected high barbed wire fences around the "convention" and deployed thousands of troops and "national guardsmen" from all over the country as bodyguards, almost turning Chicago into a military camp, the broad masses of Chicago still held anti-Democratic Party "convention" demonstrations and marches for several consecutive days. On August 28, more than 12,000 demonstrators charged the Democratic Party "convention," and many people, despite the tear gas fired by the fascist police, rushed into the headquarters of the Democratic Party "convention."

The presidential candidates of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the newly established Independent Party, Nixon, Humphrey, and Wallace, encountered opposition from the people wherever they went during their "campaign" activities across the country. Demonstrators in various places pointed out that the U.S. presidential "election" is a complete fraud played by the monopoly capitalist class to deceive the American people, and all U.S. presidential candidates are servants of the monopoly capitalist class and are of the same ilk.

On November 5, when the farce of the U.S. presidential "election" officially began, tens of thousands of young students in more than a dozen major cities across the United States took to the streets again, holding large-scale demonstrations and marches, burning the American flag and many ballots, expressing their protest against the undemocratic "election" system and opposition to the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the ruling clique.

The strong resistance and opposition of the American people to the presidential "election" farce staged by the American ruling clique is a new phenomenon in the United States. The emergence of this new phenomenon shows that the deception and suppression of the American monopoly capitalist class against its own people are becoming less and less effective, and the American people are in a new state of awakening.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "In the United States, there is another class of people who are truly powerful, and that is the American people." As the awareness of the American people continues to rise, their power will be further demonstrated, and the days of the American reactionaries will be increasingly difficult.

    美国广大人民反对和抵制总统“选举”丑剧
    各地示威群众指出所有美国总统候选人都是一丘之貉
    据新华社八日讯　美国垄断资产阶级今年上演的总统“选举”丑剧，从一开始就遭到美国广大人民群众的强烈反对。美国各城市的人民群众连续举行声势浩大的示威游行，谴责“选举”骗局，抗议美帝国主义反动的对内对外政策。这是美国历史上从未有过的，充分说明美国人民正在迅速觉醒。
    早在今年八月，美国垄断资产阶级的御用工具民主党和共和党分别在芝加哥和迈阿密召开“全国代表大会”，物色总统候选人时，芝加哥和迈阿密的电气安装工人就连续举行罢工，使这两个党的“代表大会”还未开场就碰到了重重困难。
    八月七日，当共和党的“代表大会”正在迈阿密召开时，迈阿密的广大黑人群众掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的抗议共和党“代表大会”的斗争。
    八月底，当民主党在芝加哥召开“代表大会”时，尽管美国反动统治当局在“代表大会”周围筑起高高的铁丝网，又从全国各地调了数千名军队和“国民警卫队”来做保镖，几乎把芝加哥变成了一个军营。但是芝加哥的广大群众仍一连几天举行反对民主党“代表大会”的示威游行。八月二十八日，一万二千多名示威群众向民主党“代表大会”进行了冲击，许多群众冒着法西斯警察施放的催泪瓦斯，冲进了民主党“代表大会”的总部。
    共和党、民主党和新成立的独立党的总统候选人尼克松、汉弗莱和沃利斯在全国举行“竞选”活动时，到处遭到人民群众的反对。各地的示威群众还明确指出，美国总统“选举”完全是垄断资产阶级玩弄的欺骗美国人民的大骗局，所有美国总统候选人都是垄断资产阶级的奴仆，都是一丘之貉。
    十一月五日，美国总统“选举”丑剧正式开演的时候，美国全国十几个大城市的成千上万的青年学生，再次走上街头，举行大规模的示威游行，焚毁美国星条旗和许多选票，表示抗议不民主的“选举”制度和反对统治集团反动的国内外政策。
    美国人民对美国统治集团策划的总统“选举”丑剧进行这样强烈的抵制和反对，这在美国是一个新的事物。这个新事物的出现说明美国垄断资产阶级对本国人民的欺骗和镇压都越来越不灵了，美国人民正处于新的觉醒之中。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“在美国，另有一类人是真正有力量的，这就是美国人民。”随着美国人民觉悟程度的不断提高，他们的力量将进一步显示出来，美国反动派的日子越来越不好过了。
