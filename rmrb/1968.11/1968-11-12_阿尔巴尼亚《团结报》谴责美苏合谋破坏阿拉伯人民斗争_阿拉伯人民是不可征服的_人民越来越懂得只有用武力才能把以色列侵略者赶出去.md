Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Denounces U.S.-Soviet Conspiracy to Sabotage Arab People's Struggle

The Arab People Are Indomitable
The People Increasingly Understand That Only Force Can Drive Out the Israeli Aggressors

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 10th: The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper published a commentary on the 10th, exposing and condemning the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to sabotage the Arab people's just struggle against Israeli aggression, forcing Arab countries to accept their planned so-called "peaceful resolution" of the Middle East issue.

	The commentary said, in order to solve the Middle East issue on the basis of serving the common interests of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are busily negotiating in the United Nations. The Israeli aggressors, at the instigation of their masters, continue to brutally suppress the liberation movements of the Arab people in the occupied territories and threaten Arab countries with military provocations to accept the so-called "peaceful resolution" methods planned by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	The commentary pointed out that despite the imperialists and their tool, the Israeli aggressors, making every effort, and the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique's despicable betrayal, the Arab people have not been conquered. They will never allow their fate to be treated as a commodity in the U.S.-Soviet bargaining market, will never allow their brothers to be under the rule and brutal terrorist suppression of the Israeli aggressors, and will absolutely not allow the Israeli rulers to occupy Palestine, making the Palestinian people forever separated from their homeland. The commentary continued, the more the Israeli aggressors intensify their terrorist suppression of the Arab people in the occupied territories and provoke Arab countries, the more the Arab patriots will strengthen their struggle against the detestable occupiers, and the more the people of Arab countries will understand that only force can drive the Israeli aggressors out of the lands they occupy.

　　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》谴责美苏合谋破坏阿拉伯人民斗争
　　阿拉伯人民是不可征服的
　　人民越来越懂得只有用武力才能把以色列侵略者赶出去
    新华社地拉那十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十日发表短评，揭露和谴责美苏合谋破坏阿拉伯人民反对以色列侵略的正义斗争，迫使阿拉伯国家接受他们策划的所谓“和平解决”中东问题的阴谋。
    短评说，为了在适合美帝和苏修共同主宰世界的利益的基础上解决中东问题，苏美正在联合国紧张地进行交易。以色列侵略者在其主子的唆使下继续野蛮镇压被其占领的地区的阿拉伯人民的解放运动，并以军事挑衅威胁阿拉伯国家，要他们接受美苏策划的所谓“和平解决”办法。
    短评指出，尽管帝国主义者及其工具以色列侵略者进行百般的努力，以及苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团进行卑鄙的叛卖，但是，阿拉伯人民没有被征服。他们现在和将来都永远不允许把他们的命运当作苏美交易所的商品，永远不允许他们的兄弟处于以色列侵略者的统治和野蛮的恐怖的镇压下，绝不允许以色列统治者霸占巴勒斯坦，使巴勒斯坦人民永远远离自己的家园。短评接着说，以色列侵略者越是加紧对其占领区的阿拉伯人民的恐怖镇压和对阿拉伯国家的挑衅，阿拉伯爱国者就越会加强反对可恶的占领者的斗争，阿拉伯国家的人民就越加懂得，只有用武力才能把以色列侵略者从其所占领的土地上赶出去。
