The Water Source Commune in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, relied closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants during the process of streamlining and reducing redundancy. They conducted a thorough revolutionary criticism, eliminating the influence of old ideas and practices of the exploiting classes, establishing a new revolutionary style, and winning the hearts of the masses.

Breaking Down Small Circles, Joining Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Revolution

After the establishment of the Water Source Commune Revolutionary Committee, two rounds of institutional reforms were conducted. After much effort, the number of staff was reduced from thirty-seven to twenty-eight. Although some institutions were merged, the commune still had a large number of institutions. On one hand, the institutions remained cumbersome; on the other hand, those who remained in the commune or were reassigned had difficulties accepting the changes. Some people thought, "Streamlining is the business of higher-level organizations. Basic-level units should be strengthened. The commune is at the grassroots level, and cadres are busy all day. We should add more people, not reduce them." Others said, "Having more cadres in the commune is okay, as long as we change our work style!" In reality, they wanted to maintain the status quo. The poor and lower-middle peasants commented, "The commune has smashed the old signs, changed the names of the offices, but the cadres have not changed their ways. We must carry out a thorough revolution."

Why were the first two rounds of streamlining not thorough? The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the commune revolutionary committee, with this question in mind, studied together the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining and reducing redundancy." Through study, everyone deeply understood that "streamlining and reducing redundancy" is a major measure to build a revolutionary leadership that is closely connected with the masses. It is inevitable that there will be resistance from the old ideas, habits, and forces of the exploiting classes. In this sharp struggle, only by relying on the main force of the cultural revolution in the countryside—the poor and lower-middle peasants—can we truly carry out streamlining and reducing redundancy. Therefore, they carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They adopted the methods of going out and inviting in, relying closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, to carry out the third round of streamlining.

Together with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Criticizing the Revisionist Line of Political Power Construction

After the study class carefully studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and reduce redundancy, and organize a revolutionary leadership that is closely connected with the masses," they brought the question of "Should the commune be streamlined or not?" to various types of production teams. They held study classes and conducted research and discussions with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the cadre staff in the study class angrily exposed the many obstacles that the old institutions placed in the way of cadres' close connection with the masses: (1) Too many meetings, reports, and documents tied up the cadres' hands, preventing them from spending more time with the masses. Statistics showed that some commune cadres spent over 150 days in a year attending meetings at the commune and higher levels. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The old institutions lock the cadres in the office, busy with paperwork, cutting off their connection with the masses." (2) Too many levels of bureaucracy. In 1964, the Xianfeng Brigade wanted to open up new land to expand the cultivated area. They went to the commune multiple times to discuss it, meeting with the secretary, the commune leader, the party secretary, and others, taking over a month to resolve the issue. The poor and lower-middle peasants were dissatisfied, saying, "We can't find the cadres down here, and when we go up, we have to go through so many levels. This isn't a service-oriented institution for the poor and lower-middle peasants!" (3) Some cadres developed bureaucratic tendencies, seriously alienating themselves from the masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflected, "We work in the fields every day, but some cadres, dressed neatly, walk on the dikes and main roads. They come down to listen to reports and go up to make reports, full of officialdom." (4) Some cadres issued orders from above, dictating even the timing of sowing and transplanting, and sending work teams to supervise the implementation. The poor and lower-middle peasants were dissatisfied with this approach, saying, "The old institutions control everything, and if this continues, they will manage more and more, becoming further and further from the masses."

The poor and lower-middle peasants also exposed and denounced the harm and corruption that the revisionist line of political power construction had on the cadres. Of the original thirty-seven cadres in the commune, thirty-four were outstanding individuals selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, after coming to the commune, some changed their status, thoughts, and attitudes, becoming less involved in labor. Some began to rank themselves, compete for positions, compare benefits, and compare clothing. A few even degenerated and turned against the revolution.

The more the poor and lower-middle peasants spoke, the clearer they saw the reactionary nature of the revisionist line of political power construction; the more they spoke, the more they hated Liu Shaoqi. The study class also conducted an in-depth criticism of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "the more people, the bigger the institution, the more complex the organization should be," further educating the commune cadres. They said, "The revisionist line of political power construction is truly a poisoned arrow aimed at our hearts. If we do not thoroughly eliminate its poison, it will cause cadres to degenerate and the political power to change color." Those who originally emphasized that the commune is a grassroots level and should not be streamlined, but should add more people to strengthen political power construction, also realized: whether the power of the proletariat is strengthened or weakened, the most fundamental sign is to see how the connection with the masses is, not the number of people.

The masses are the best teachers, and revolutionary criticism is the most practical and vivid classroom. Following this, the commune cadres discussed the staffing of the commune office with the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the end, everyone agreed to change the three departments and one office into two departments (Political Work Department and Administrative Department), reducing the staff from twenty-eight to thirteen.

Learning from the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Going to Where the Masses Need You

The streamlining plan was determined, but where would the streamlined personnel go? Some comrades had new thoughts. Some wanted to go to the commune's direct-affiliated units to be cadres, fearing to go to the production brigades to be commune members. Others said, "Going down to the production brigades is the right direction, but I want to go back to my own home." There were also comrades who saw themselves as being streamlined as if they had been punished, feeling ashamed to see relatives and the masses. In the study class, the poor and lower-middle peasants helped those with ideological issues resolve their problems. Over sixty-year-old poor peasant Zhu Baoshen said, "Liu Shaoqi wants to use the 'selfish' ideas in our heads to push the revisionist line of political power construction. We must fight against our selfish thoughts to eliminate the poison of revisionism."

With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the cadre staff realized that whether to be an official or to revolutionize is a major issue in the struggle between the two lines of political power construction. If one does not fight against selfish thoughts, one can only be an "official" and not a common person, losing direction and joining the wrong side. They all expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining and reducing redundancy," going to the most difficult and needed places.

Honestly Accepting the Help and Supervision of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Establishing a New Revolutionary Style

After the streamlining of the commune revolutionary committee, the staff of the new institution were mostly more closely connected with the masses and worked actively. However, a few comrades had a sense of difficulty, thinking, "Pulling out a radish leaves a hole, and with fewer people, it's hard to complete the tasks."

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the revolutionary committee organized all the staff of the institution to repeatedly discuss: with the new institution having fewer people and more tasks, what should be done? At the same time, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The current situation and habits often bind people's minds tightly, even revolutionaries cannot avoid this sometimes." Everyone realized: the establishment of the new institution is only a guarantee for establishing a new revolutionary style that is closely connected with the masses, but to truly establish this new style, one must actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously promote ideological revolutionization, and must rely closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and persistently struggle against the old ideas and styles of the exploiting classes. Therefore, as soon as the new institution was established, they continued to hold study classes with the participation of the poor and lower-middle peasants, listening to their opinions, and summarizing the experiences and lessons of past work. In this way, they further realized: with fewer people and more tasks in the new institution, one must do the following: grasp the fundamentals among the myriad of tasks, first of all, grasp the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought; go deep into reality, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and solve most of the problems in the production brigades and in their infancy; cultivate models and promote overall progress.

Due to the active support and enthusiastic help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, in less than a month, the thoughts and styles of the commune cadres changed greatly. Usually, except for leaving two people on duty at home, the other comrades all carried their luggage, held the Little Red Book, and went to the front lines of class struggle and production struggle. Where it was difficult, they went there to fight with the masses, being the students of the masses; where the difficulties were greatest, they went there to help the masses solve problems.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing the changes in the thoughts and styles of the commune cadres, excitedly said, "The commune has a new look, the cadres come to our village to work, visiting and laboring, truly connecting with our hearts."

### 依靠贫下中农精简公社机构　辽宁省营口县水源公社实行精兵简政的经验

　　依靠贫下中农精简公社机构
　　辽宁省营口县水源公社实行精兵简政的经验
    辽宁省营口县水源公社，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，在精兵简政的过程中，紧紧依靠贫下中农，深入开展群众性的革命大批判，清除了剥削阶级旧观念、旧作风的影响，树立了崭新的革命作风，深受群众欢迎。
    打破小圈子，和贫下中农一起闹革命
    水源公社革委会成立后曾进行过两次机构改革。费了很大周折，工作人员才由三十七名减少到二十八名，虽然合并了一些机构，但是在公社革委会下还设有三组（政工组、生产组、教改组）一室（综合办公室）。这样精简的结果，一方面机构仍然庞大，另一方面留在公社机关或者被精简下放的人员思想不通。有的人认为：“精简是县以上机关的事，基层单位应该充实、加强。公社是基层，干部一天忙得团团转，只应该增人，不应该精简。”还有的说：“公社的干部多一点没关系，注意转变作风就行啦！”实际上，心里想的还是维持原状。贫下中农反映说：“公社砸了旧牌匾，机关换了新名称，就是干部没有新作风，必须彻底革命。”
    为什么前两次精简搞得不彻底？解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和公社革委会带着这个问题，一起学习毛主席关于“精兵简政”教导的伟大意义。经过学习，大家深深认识到：“精兵简政”是建设密切联系群众的革命化领导班子的重大措施，必然会遇到剥削阶级的旧观念、旧习惯、旧势力的抵抗。在这场尖锐的斗争中，只有紧紧依靠农村中文化革命的主力军——贫下中农，才能真正把精兵简政进行到底。于是，他们发扬彻底革命精神，和贫下中农一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，采取走出去、请进来的办法，紧紧依靠贫下中农，进行第三次精简。
    和贫下中农一起，狠批修正主义政权建设路线
    学习班在认真学习了毛主席关于“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示之后，带着“公社到底需要不需要精简？”这个问题，到各种不同类型生产队去，和广大贫下中农一起，办学习班，进行研究和讨论。
    广大贫下中农和机关干部在学习班上，愤怒揭发了旧机构阻碍干部密切联系群众的重重障碍：（一）会议、表报、文件多，烦琐的事务捆住了干部的手脚，使他们没有更多时间到群众中去。据统计，有的公社干部，一年在公社和上面开会的时间就达一百五十多天。贫下中农说：“旧机构把干部锁在屋子里忙事务，割断了和群众的联系。”（二）办事层次多。一九六四年，先锋大队要开荒扩大耕地面积，多次到公社商量，找了秘书、社长、书记等五人，费时一个多月也没解决。贫下中农不满地说：“咱们在下面找不到干部，到上面又要经过这么些关卡，这那象为贫下中农服务的机构？”（三）一些干部滋长了官僚主义作风，严重地脱离群众。贫下中农反映说：“咱天天在水田里劳动，可是一些干部，穿得干干净净，尽站在坝埂上走干道。下来就听汇报，上去就作报告，满身是官气。”（四）一些干部坐在上面发号施令，连每年什么时候播种，怎么插秧，都要社员按照他们关着门作出的计划去做，甚至还派出工作组去监督群众执行。贫下中农对这种做法很反感，他们说：“旧机构处处管着群众，这样下去，就会越管离群众越远。”
    贫下中农还揭发和控诉了修正主义政权建设路线对干部的毒害和腐蚀。原公社三十七名干部中，就有三十四名是贫下中农选送的优秀分子。但到公社以后，有的地位变了，思想也变了，架子大了，劳动少了。有的开始排名次，争地位，比待遇，比吃穿。个别人还发展到蜕化变质，走向了革命的反面。
    贫下中农越摆，对修正主义政权建设路线的反动本质看得越清；越摆，对刘少奇越恨。学习班还针对刘少奇散布的“人多了，机构大了，组织就要复杂点”的反动谬论，展开了深入的批判，进一步教育了公社干部。他们说：“修正主义政权建设路线，真是射向我们心脏的一支毒箭，不彻底肃清它的流毒，就会使干部变质，政权变色。”原来强调公社是基层，不应该精简，只有增人才是加强政权建设的同志也认识到：无产阶级的权力机构是加强了，还是削弱了，最根本的标志是看同群众的联系怎样，而不是看人数多少。
    群众是最好的先生，革命大批判是最实际、最生动的课堂。接着公社干部又同贫下中农一起讨论了公社机关的编制。最后，大家一致的意见：把三组一室改为两个组（政工组、办事组），办事人员由二十八人精简到十三人。
    向贫下中农学习，到群众最需要的地方去
    精简的方案确定了，精简下来的人员到那里去呢？有些同志又产生了活思想。有的同志想到公社直属部门当干部，怕到生产队当社员。也有的说：“下到生产队是方向，我要回自己家去。”还有的同志把自己被精简下来看作是受了处分似的，认为见到亲友、群众不光采。在学习班里，贫下中农再次帮助有思想问题的干部解决思想疙瘩。六十多岁的老贫农祝宝申说：“刘少奇想利用我们头脑里资产阶级的‘私’字，推行政权建设的修正主义路线，我们就要狠斗私心，才能肃清修正主义流毒。”
    机关干部在贫下中农的帮助下认识到，干部是要做官，还是要革命，这是关系到在政权建设两条路线的斗争中，站在那一边的大问题。如果不狠斗私心，只能当“官”不能当老百姓，就会迷失方向，站错队。他们都表示要坚决执行毛主席“精兵简政”的指示，到最艰苦、最需要的地方去。
    老老实实地接受贫下中农的帮助、监督，树立革命新作风
    公社革命委员会精简以后，新机构的办事人员，大多数更加密切联系群众，积极工作。但是也有少数同志，存在着“拔个萝卜空个坑，人员少了任务难完成”的畏难情绪。
    解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会，就组织机关全体办事人员，反复讨论：新机构人少事多要求高，到底怎么办？同时学习了毛主席的教导：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”大家认识到：新机构的建立，还只是为树立一个革命化的联系群众的新作风提供了组织保证，而要真正把新作风树立起来，还必须活学活用毛泽东思想，不断促进思想革命化，必须紧紧依靠贫下中农，同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风作坚持不懈的斗争。因此，新机构一成立起来，他们就继续举办有贫下中农参加的学习班，听取贫下中农的意见，总结过去工作的经验教训。这样，进一步认识到：新机构人少事多，必须做到：千头万绪抓根本，首先抓好活学活用毛泽东思想；深入实际，依靠贫下中农，把大量的问题解决在生产队，解决在萌芽状态；培养典型，推动全面。
    由于贫下中农的积极支持，热情帮助，不到一个月的时间，公社干部的思想作风就起了很大的变化。平时，他们除了留两个人在家里值班以外，其他同志都身背行李，怀揣宝书，走上阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线，那里艰苦，他们就到那里和群众同战斗，做群众的小学生；那里困难最大，他们就到那里帮助群众去解决问题。
    广大贫下中农见到公社干部思想作风的变化，兴奋地说：“公社面貌一片新，干部办事到咱村，又是走访又劳动，真是和咱心连心。”
