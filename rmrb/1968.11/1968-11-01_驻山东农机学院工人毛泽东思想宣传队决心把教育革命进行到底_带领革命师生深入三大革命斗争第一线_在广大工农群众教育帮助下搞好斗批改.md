The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Shandong Agricultural Machinery Institute, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "We advocate that intellectuals go among the people, go to the factories, go to the countryside" and "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," recently led the revolutionary teachers and students to the front lines of the three great revolutionary struggles. They accepted re-education from the broad masses of workers and peasants and, together with them, carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They blazed a new trail for the school to achieve the proletarian educational revolution, further consolidating and developing the great achievements of the working class leading the educational revolution.

To the Three Great Revolutionary Practices for Educational Revolution

After the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the school, they propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, launched a revolutionary criticism, purged the class ranks, and achieved significant results in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. However, as the movement deepened, new contradictions emerged. Some teachers and students lacked confidence in carrying out the educational revolution and were not enthusiastic about participating in the revolutionary criticism. Although the majority of teachers and students were eager to reform teaching, they found no direction and had no way to apply their energy.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Correct ideas can only come from social practice, from the three kinds of practice—production, class struggle, and scientific experiment." The Worker Propaganda Team studied Chairman Mao's teachings, carefully examined the school's situation, and believed that before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party of this institute had vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, which separated from proletarian politics, the masses of workers and peasants, and productive labor, deeply poisoning the teachers and students. To deepen the educational revolution, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, place the revolutionary teachers and students in the three great revolutionary practices, contact workers and peasants, contact reality, change old ideas, and explore new paths for the educational revolution. At that time, it was the busy season for the autumn harvest, requiring urgent harvesting, plowing, and sowing. This school is a technical university directly serving agriculture. Therefore, the Worker Propaganda Team decided to lead the revolutionary teachers and students out of the school gates, combining support for the autumn harvest with the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They divided the revolutionary teachers and students into two groups: one went to the practice factory, and the other went to the countryside on tractors. Those who went to the countryside were organized by tractor units, with one or two members of the Worker Propaganda Team responsible for political leadership in each unit.

Combining Practice with the Study of Chairman Mao's Works, Accepting Re-education from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Students from old schools, most or the majority of them, can combine with workers and peasants. Some of them have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership and receive re-education from workers and peasants to thoroughly change their old ideas." The Worker Propaganda Team led the revolutionary teachers and students to the front lines of production, placing the emphasis on highlighting proletarian politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Every time they arrived at a new village, the Propaganda Team's first task was to organize the revolutionary teachers and students to visit the poor, conduct social investigations, understand the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, and learn from the masses about the practical experience of class struggle and production struggle. After entering the village, they organized the revolutionary teachers and students to insist on eating, living, studying, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, recalling bitterness and sweetness together, and jointly carrying out revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary teachers and students, regardless of how heavy their tasks were, how busy their work was, or how tired their bodies were, insisted on a strict political life system, reading Chairman Mao's books every day, holding struggle-against-self and criticism-of-revisionism meetings every day, and at all times and in all places propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses, turning the tractor team into a production team, a study team, and a propaganda team. Before leaving the village, they held a meeting to solicit opinions and accept the political, ideological, and technical evaluations from the poor and lower-middle peasants, obtaining a "graduation certificate."

The teachers and students of the "Stalin No. 100" tractor unit, before leaving the school, thought only about learning some technology and paid little attention to how the land was plowed. After arriving in the countryside, they were influenced by the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants and their thoughts changed. Many teachers and students said: "The closer we are to workers and peasants, the closer we are to Chairman Mao; the farther we are from workers and peasants, the faster we will undergo peaceful evolution." Once, they drove to a village and saw groups of commune members busily deep plowing the land. An old peasant said: "Planting wheat a day earlier is better than fertilizing it once, and producing an extra pound of grain is a contribution to Chairman Mao. We must strive for a bumper harvest this year no matter what!" The first day's experiences in this village had a great impact on the teachers and students. They said: "Workers and peasants think of Chairman Mao and the country; we think of ourselves and technology." That day, the Worker Propaganda Team members led them to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," inspiring them to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants with the spirit of "completely," "thoroughly," and "seeking perfection." The teachers and students put politics in command, abandoned the purely technical viewpoint, and during plowing, they always considered the needs of the masses. When encountering difficult-to-plow land, they plowed it twice or even three times until the poor and lower-middle peasants were satisfied. When the tractor broke down, they repaired it as quickly as possible to save time and plow more land. The masses praised them, saying: "Chairman Mao's Red Guards are truly good!"

In more than a month of participating in the three great revolutionary practices, the teachers and students underwent significant changes in their spiritual outlook. Some classes summarized the several advantages of this practice: where there were the most teachers, the largest classrooms, the richest content, the most thorough exposure of selfishness, the most intense struggle, and the fastest correction. Going to the three great revolutionary practices is a good way for intellectuals to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers and a good method to thoroughly change old ideas.

Learning from Workers and Peasants, Carrying Out the Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

For a long time, a handful of capitalist roaders in Shandong Agricultural Machinery Institute vigorously promoted the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, setting up courses and teaching plans not based on actual needs, leading teaching completely away from reality and serving agricultural production. After arriving at the front lines of the three great revolutionary struggles, the Worker Propaganda Team mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students to expose a handful of capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" in the fields and farmlands, together with the masses of workers and peasants, and carry out revolutionary criticism combined with reality.

This institute had a reactionary academic "authority" who was once praised by the capitalist roaders as the "jewel of agricultural machinery" nationwide. As a result, he could not start a tractor in the field, could not disassemble parts in the machine shed, and could not even perform a simple plowing action. For deep plowing, the reactionary academic "authority" said that one must first observe the terrain, draw a rough sketch, use higher mathematics, and solve many "X + Y" equations to determine the plowing path before inserting the plow. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Deep plowing is not difficult; look where the land is low and insert the plow there!" One sentence solved the problem that the reactionary academic "authority" could not solve in dozens of hours. Installing the tractor track plate according to the method of the reactionary academic "authority" was impossible, but the worker teacher took a hammer and tapped it twice, and the track plate was installed. A teacher sighed: "In the past, we believed in the reactionary academic 'authority,' blindly followed the dogma, and read a basket of books, which was not as good as two hammer blows from the worker teacher." The Worker Propaganda Team organized the teachers and students to use these living materials to criticize and denounce the revisionist educational line, overthrowing the class enemies and deeply educating themselves. Many teachers and students said: "We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and forever learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers."

"Without destruction, there can be no construction.... Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Through revolutionary criticism, the old frameworks and foreign dogmas were broken, greatly promoting the reform of teaching. In the past, the capitalist roaders kept the students in the classroom all day, from theory to theory, from material to material. Some students graduated after four years but still could not drive a tractor. Now, the classroom is moved to the machine shed and fields, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, combining actual teaching with practice, and implementing Chairman Mao's advocacy of the mass line teaching principle of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers." In just two days, everyone learned to drive and could work independently, and in seven days, they could eliminate general faults. In the past, brand-new tractors were dismantled one by one and repaired in the classroom, but the students still could not learn. This time, the students personally repaired the broken tractors and quickly learned. They repaired thirteen tractors in twenty days. The students said: "In the past, we learned empty and mysterious theories, which were invisible and intangible; now we learn practical skills, which can be used immediately. We learned in a month what we could not learn in several years."

    驻山东农机学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队决心把教育革命进行到底
    带领革命师生深入三大革命斗争第一线
    在广大工农群众教育帮助下搞好斗批改
    本报讯　驻山东农机学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席关于“我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去”、“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，最近把广大革命师生带到三大革命斗争实践中去，接受工农兵的再教育，同广大工农群众一起进行斗、批、改，为学校实现无产阶级教育革命闯出了一条新路子，进一步巩固和发展了工人阶级领导教育革命的伟大成果。
    到三大革命实践中去进行教育革命
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进学校以后，宣传落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，斗、批、改取得了很大成果。但是随着运动的深入发展，新的矛盾不断出现。有些师生对搞好教育革命缺乏信心，参加革命大批判不积极了。大多数师生虽然迫切要求改革教学，又觉得找不到头绪，有劲使不上。
    毛主席教导我们：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”工人宣传队学习了毛主席的教导，认真研究了学校的情况，认为文化大革命前，这个学院的党内一小撮走资派，极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产劳动的反革命修正主义教育路线，对师生毒害很深。要把教育革命深入一步，必须遵循毛主席的教导，把广大革命师生放到三大革命斗争实践中去，接触工农，接触实际，改变旧思想，摸索教育革命的新路子。当时正值三秋大忙季节，需要抢收、抢耕、抢种。这个学校又是直接为农业服务的工科大学。于是，工人宣传队决定把广大革命师生带出校门，结合支援三秋搞好斗、批、改。他们把革命师生分成两路，一路到实习工厂，一路开上拖拉机到农村。到农村去的，以机车为单位编组，每组都有工人宣传队一两名同志负责政治领导。
    结合实际活学活用毛主席著作，接受工农兵的再教育
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。”工人宣传队领导革命师生到了生产第一线，把突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，接受工农兵的再教育放在首位。
    每到一个新的村庄，宣传队第一件事就是组织革命师生访贫问苦，进行社会调查，了解文化大革命的大好形势，向群众学习阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践经验。进村后，他们组织革命师生坚持同贫下中农同吃，同住，同学习，同劳动，一起忆苦思甜，一起开展革命大批判。革命师生不论任务多重，工作多紧，身体多累，都坚持严格的政治生活制度，天天读毛主席的书，天天开斗私批修讲用会，时时处处向革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，把机耕队变成了既是生产队，又是学习队，又是宣传队。出村前，他们召开座谈会，征求意见，接受贫下中农的政治、思想、技术鉴定，取得“毕业证书”。
    “斯大林一百号”机组的师生，出校前，心里想的是学点技术，地耕得如何很少考虑。他们到了农村，受到贫下中农革命精神的熏染，思想起了变化。许多师生说：离工农兵越近，跟毛主席越紧；离工农兵越远，“和平演变”得越快。有一次，他们开车到一个村庄，看到成群结队的社员正在紧张地深翻土地。一位贫农老大爷说：“早种一天麦，胜追一遍肥，多打一斤粮，就是向毛主席多献一份忠心，拚上老命也得夺来今年大丰产啊！”进这个村第一天的所见所闻，就使师生们受到很大的震动。他们说：“工人、农民一心想着毛主席，想着国家；我们想的是个人，是技术。”当天，工人宣传队的同志领导他们学习了“老三篇”，启发他们拿出“完全”“彻底”、“精益求精”的精神，好好地为贫下中农服务。师生们政治挂了帅，丢开了单纯技术观点，机耕时处处为群众着想，遇到难耕的地，一遍不行耕两遍，两遍不行耕三遍，直到贫下中农满意。拖拉机出了毛病，他们就分秒必争地赶快修好，争取时间多耕地。群众赞扬他们说：“毛主席的红卫兵真是好！”
    在三大革命斗争实践的一个多月，师生们精神面貌发生了很大的变化。有的班级总结了这次实践的几大好处：那里教员最多，课堂最大，内容最丰富，“私”字暴露得最彻底，斗得最狠，改正得最快。到三大革命斗争实践中去，是知识分子接受工农兵再教育的一种好形式，是彻底改变旧思想的好办法。
    拜工农兵为师，搞好斗批改
    长期以来，山东农机学院一小撮走资派极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，课程设置、教学计划都不是根据实际需要确定，把教学引向完全脱离实际、脱离为农业生产服务的轨道。开到三大革命斗争第一线以后，工人宣传队发动广大革命师生，把一小撮走资派和反动学术“权威”揪到田间、地头，同工农兵群众一起，结合实际开展革命大批判。
　　这个学院有一个反动学术“权威”，曾被走资派吹捧为全国的“农机明珠”。结果，他在田间发动不起拖拉机，到机库拆卸不下零件，甚至连个简单的打犁动作都不会。机耕打墒，反动学术“权威”说，必须先观测地形，绘制草图，用高等数学，来许多“X＋Y”求出墒道，然后才能插犁。贫下中农说：“打墒没难处，你看那里地洼就从那里插犁！”一句话解决了反动学术“权威”几十个小时解决不了的问题。安装拖拉机链轨板，按反动学术“权威”讲的方法，怎么也装不好，工人师傅拿起铁锤来叮当两下子，就把链轨板给装好了。有个教师感慨地说：“过去我们迷信反动学术‘权威’，死啃教条，读书一大筐还不如工人师傅两锤子。”工人宣传队组织师生运用这些活材料，批判和声讨修正主义教育路线，批倒了阶级敌人，也深刻地教育了自己。许多师生说：“我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示办事，永远拜工农兵为师。”
    “不破不立。……破字当头，立也就在其中了。”通过革命大批判，破了旧框框，洋教条，大大促进了教学改革。过去教学，走资派整天把学生关在教室里，从理论到理论，从材料到材料，有人上了四年大学，还不会开拖拉机。现在，把课堂搬到机库、田间，以毛泽东思想作指针，结合实际教学，贯彻执行毛主席提倡的“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”群众路线的教学原则，仅仅两天时间，大家就学会了驾驶，并能独立工作，七天就能排除一般性故障。过去把崭新的拖拉机，一个个拆散，在课堂上讲怎样修复，讲来讲去学生还是不会。这次让学生亲自修理坏了的拖拉机，很快就学会了。他们二十几天就修复了十三台拖拉机。学生们说：“过去学的是空才玄学，看不见，摸不着；现在学的是真才实学，学了就能用，一个月学了几年学不到的东西。”
