The news of the communiqué from the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the village of Tong in Shuanglong Commune, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province. Immediately, the entire village was in an uproar, with joyous drumbeats and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoing everywhere. At that moment, a crisp sound of firecrackers filled the air above the village, adding to the festive atmosphere of the day.

This round of firecrackers was set off by Tong Dajie, a 62-year-old old party member, old poor peasant, and old military dependent from Tong Village. Today, the firecrackers she personally set off had a special significance. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which decided to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chih from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party, expressed her innermost feelings. Listening to the crisp and clear sound of the firecrackers, Old Lady Tong recalled an incident from over a decade ago when she had bought firecrackers but couldn't set them off:

In March 1955, Old Lady Tong enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize together" and, along with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village, initiated the merging of the three agricultural cooperatives in the village into one advanced cooperative. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the three small cooperatives unanimously supported this initiative. The advanced cooperative was about to be established, and this was a great joyous event! Old Lady Tong specially bought some firecrackers, planning to let the cooperative members have a good time on the day the advanced cooperative was established. Little did she know that at that moment, a strange wind blew from some dark corner, saying things like "the cooperative was established too early," "it was a mess," "the conditions were not ripe," and that it should "quickly dismount." Some even said that this was the "instruction" of some "big figure" from "above," which had to be followed. In this strange wind, the advanced cooperative in Tong Village was not established, and the small cooperatives were disbanded. Seeing the young sapling of the agricultural cooperative, which was about to grow, being chopped down by this "big figure," Old Lady Tong was extremely heartbroken! She held the firecrackers she had just bought and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, weeping uncontrollably. She thought: This "big figure" wants the cooperative to "dismount," does he want us poor and lower-middle peasants to return to the old society?

Thinking of the old society, Old Lady Tong couldn't suppress the anger in her heart. What kind of days were those! Poor people had three paths: jumping into the river, hanging themselves, or going to jail. In front of Old Lady Tong's door, it was often the case that "the landlord leaves, the running dogs come, demanding rent and debts, making the whole family cry." Old Lady Tong gave birth to seven children, but four of them died of hunger and illness. Her husband couldn't bear the hardships of those days and also fell ill and passed away. In that dark old society, Old Lady Tong, like all the poor people in the village, had tasted the bitterness of gall and shed countless tears of sorrow.

The East is red, the sun rises, Chairman Mao led the poor and lower-middle peasants to overthrow the landlords, distribute the land, and the poor and lower-middle peasants finally stood up. Chairman Mao also called on the poor and lower-middle peasants to "organize together" and take the road of agricultural collectivization. Since the mutual aid teams and cooperatives were organized in Tong Village, Old Lady Tong and all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village had a life like sesame seeds blooming and growing day by day, and their days became more and more prosperous. Old Lady Tong was deeply grateful to Chairman Mao from the bottom of her heart. But now, a "big figure" came out, deliberately going against Chairman Mao, wanting the cooperatives to "quickly dismount," trying to make us poor and lower-middle peasants return to the old society, suffer twice the bitterness, and endure twice the hardships. Old Lady Tong was determined that this "big figure" was definitely not a good person! She made a firm resolution in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to follow you. The poor and lower-middle peasants establishing advanced cooperatives is your call, we will follow your words and do it, absolutely no one can stop us, we will definitely follow the path of agricultural collectivization that you have pointed out for us, all the way to communism! Old Lady Tong and the poor and lower-middle peasants, facing the strange wind, reorganized the disbanded small cooperatives and actively prepared to establish the advanced cooperative....

During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Old Lady Tong finally learned that the "big figure" who chopped down the cooperatives back then was the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chih.

Thinking of this past event, Old Lady Tong was filled with anger and indignation. She set off the firecrackers and, taking three steps at a time, rushed to the celebration venue. She jumped onto the stage and led everyone in shouting slogans: "Down with Siu Ming-chih!" "Resolutely down with Siu Ming-chih!" Then she recounted this past event to everyone, using ironclad facts to denounce Siu Ming-chih's heinous crimes. Finally, she said: "Chairman Mao's words hit the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants: 'This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism.' If it weren't for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Siu Ming-chih's plot to restore capitalism would have succeeded, and we poor and lower-middle peasants would really have to return to the old society. The decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chih from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party, we poor and lower-middle peasants support it a thousand times, we endorse it ten thousand times! Back then, Siu Ming-chih, this big villain, chopped down the cooperatives, and I bought firecrackers but couldn't set them off; today, Chairman Mao leads us to eliminate this big disaster, we want to set off more firecrackers to celebrate this great joyous event!"

As Old Lady Tong's words fell, the venue was filled with thunderous firecracker sounds.

These firecrackers symbolize the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! They symbolize the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

These firecrackers express the boundless love of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Tong Village for the great leader Chairman Mao.

These firecrackers show the firm resolve of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Tong Village to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

With the joyous sound of firecrackers, Old Lady Tong led everyone in shouting again and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席革命路线的胜利凯歌
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报传到了浙江金华县双龙公社童村大队，顿时，全村沸腾起来了，欢乐的鼓声，“毛主席万岁”的口号声，响成一片。就在这时，村庄上空传来了一阵清脆的爆竹声，为这大喜的日子增添了欢乐的气氛。
    这一阵爆竹，是童村大队六十二岁的老党员、老贫农、老军属童秋菊老大娘放的。今天她亲手放出的爆竹声有特殊的意义。党的八届十二中全会公报关于把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务的决定，说出了她的心里话。听着响亮清脆的爆竹声，童老大娘想起了十几年前她买来了爆竹却没能放的一段往事：
    一九五五年三月，童大娘积极响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，和村里的贫下中农一起，倡议把全村三个农业生产合作社并成一个高级社，三个小社的贫下中农一致赞成这个倡议。高级社就要成立了，这是一件大喜事啊！童大娘特地买了些爆竹，准备在大社成立的那天，让社员们好好热闹热闹。那知道就在这时，不知从哪个阴沟洞里刮来了一阵妖风，说什么：“合作社办早了”、“办糟了”、“条件不成熟”，要“赶快下马”。有人还说，这是“上面”一个什么“大人物”的“指示”，非执行不可。就在这阵妖风中，童村的大社没办成，小社也散了。眼看着农业生产合作社这棵就要成材的幼苗被这个什么“大人物”一斧头砍去了，童大娘是多么痛心啊！她捧着那些刚买来的爆竹，站在毛主席像前，不住地流泪。她想：这个“大人物”要合作社“下马”，难道要我们贫下中农再回到旧社会去！？
    一想起旧社会，童大娘就按捺不住心头的怒火。那是什么样的日子啊！穷人面前三条路：投河、上吊、坐监牢。童大娘家门口，经常是“地主前脚走，狗腿后脚到，又逼租，又逼债，逼得全家哭嚎啕”。童大娘生了七个儿女，就有四个被活活饿死、病死。丈夫经不起苦日子的煎熬，也一病不起，离开了人世。在那暗无天日的旧社会里，童大娘和全村所有的穷人一样，尝够了黄连苦，流干了辛酸泪。
    东方红，太阳升，毛主席领导贫下中农打倒了地主，分来了田地，贫下中农从此翻了身。毛主席还号召贫下中农“组织起来”，走农业集体化的道路。自从童村组织了互助组，成立了合作社，童大娘和全村贫下中农的生活就象芝麻开花节节高，日子越过越兴旺。童大娘打心底里感谢毛主席。可是现在，出来了一个什么“大人物”，硬是要和毛主席唱对台戏，要合作社“赶快下马”，想叫我们贫下中农回到旧社会去，重吃二遍苦，重受二茬罪。童大娘断定了这个“大人物”决不是个好种！她在毛主席像前立下了坚定的决心：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们贫下中农跟您老人家走是跟定了。贫下中农办大社，是您老人家的号召，我们照您的话去做，绝对没有错，谁也阻挡不住，我们一定要沿着您给我们指出的农业集体化的大道走到底，一直走到共产主义！童大娘和贫下中农顶着妖风，把散了的小社重新组织起来，并积极筹备办大社。……
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，童老大娘才知道当年那个大砍合作社的“大人物”，就是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。
    想起这段往事，童老大娘满腔怒火，气愤难捺。她放过了爆竹，三步并作两步来到了庆祝会场，跳上讲台就领着大伙呼开了口号：“打倒刘少奇！”“坚决打倒刘少奇！”接着她向大家追述了这段往事，用铁的事实控诉了刘少奇的滔天罪行。最后她说：“毛主席的话说到我们贫下中农的心坎上了：‘这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。’要不是毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导这场无产阶级文化大革命，让刘少奇这条恶狗复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，我们贫下中农可真要回到旧社会去了。党的八届十二中全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消他在党内外的一切职务，我们贫下中农一千个赞成，一万个拥护！当年刘少奇这个大坏蛋大砍合作社，俺买了爆竹没法放；今天毛主席领导我们清除了这个大祸害，我们要多放几响爆竹来庆祝这个大喜事！”
    童老大娘的话音刚落，会场上响起了震天的爆竹声。
    这声声爆竹，象征着毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！象征着毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
    这声声爆竹，表达了童村大队广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    这声声爆竹，显示了童村大队广大贫下中农紧跟着毛主席革命到底的坚强决心。
    随着这欢乐的爆竹声，童老大娘领着大伙一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”　（六二九八部队　永向东）
