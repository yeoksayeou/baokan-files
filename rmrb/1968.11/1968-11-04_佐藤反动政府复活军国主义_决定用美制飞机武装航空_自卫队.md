Tokyo, November 3 (Xinhua) - The Japanese Sato reactionary government, in order to further arm the Japanese Air "Self-Defense Force" this reactionary military force, has decided to use the latest American-made F4 "Phantom" fighter-bombers as the main fighter aircraft for the Japanese Air "Self-Defense Force" in the future. This decision was made after "Defense Agency" Director-General Masuda Kabutsuichi discussed it with Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato.

Masuda Kabutsuichi said at a press conference on November 1 that the "Defense Agency" will order 48 F4 "Phantom" fighter-bombers in 1971 and will order more than 100 by 1976 to equip five squadrons.

It is reported that the Sato government has also decided to have Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Aircraft Company produce the F4 "Phantom" fighter-bombers.

This fact once again shows that the Sato reactionary government, despite the firm opposition of the Japanese people, is determined to stubbornly slide down the road of reviving Japanese militarism. However, its evil deeds will not end well.

    佐藤反动政府复活军国主义
    决定用美制飞机武装航空“自卫队”
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本佐藤反动政府为了进一步武装日本航空“自卫队”这支反动军队，已于一日决定用美国制造的最新式的F4“鬼怪式”战斗轰炸机，作为日本航空“自卫队”今后使用的主力战斗机。这一决定是由日本“防卫厅”长官增田甲子七同日本首相佐藤荣作商谈后作出的。
    增田甲子七一日在记者招待会上扬言，“防卫厅”将在一九七一年订购F4“鬼怪式”战斗轰炸机四十八架，并且要在一九七六年以前订购一百数十架，装备五个飞行队。
    据报道，佐藤政府还决定由三菱重工业公司和川崎航空机公司生产F4“鬼怪式”战斗轰炸机。
    这一事实再次表明，佐藤反动政府不顾日本人民的坚决反对，决心顽固地沿着复活日本军国主义的道路滑下去。但是，它的这种罪恶行径，决没有好下场。
