Albanian agricultural workers are hurriedly carrying out autumn sowing to strive for an even greater wheat harvest next year.

BEIJING, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural workers in Durres, Saranda, and Shkodra regions of Albania have responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour to increase grain production. By harnessing human factors and selecting and promoting advanced agricultural techniques, they have achieved good results in rice production this year.

In Albania, large-scale rice cultivation began only in recent years. A few years ago, only five regions in the country planted rice. Now, ten regions across the country cultivate this grain, with a significant expansion in planting area. The yield per unit area has also been increasing year by year. In 1960, the national average yield of rice was 15.5 metric tons per hectare (approximately 206 jin per mu), while in 1967, it reached an average of 28 metric tons per hectare (approximately 373 jin per mu).

Despite adverse weather conditions affecting rice sowing and growth this year, the broad masses of agricultural workers have shown revolutionary enthusiasm and taken timely and effective measures, resulting in a good harvest.

The Yurg National Farm in Saranda, the southernmost region of Albania, achieved an average yield of 50 metric tons per hectare (approximately 666 jin per mu) this year, setting a new record for the farm's rice production.

The famous rice-producing region of Durres is expected to achieve an average yield of 52 metric tons per hectare (approximately 693 jin per mu) this year, with some agricultural cooperatives reaching 70 to 80 metric tons per hectare (approximately 933 to 1,066 jin per mu).

The Berat region, which has only recently started large-scale rice cultivation, is expected to exceed the original plan by 6 metric tons per hectare (approximately 80 jin per mu) this year.

BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Albanian agricultural workers are actively responding to the Party's call and are hurriedly carrying out autumn sowing to lay a solid foundation for next year's agricultural harvest.

Under the inspiration of the battle cry of "self-sufficiency in grain" proposed by the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the broad masses of members of agricultural cooperatives and workers of state farms, based on the rich experience of this year's grain harvest, are hurriedly sowing wheat to strive for an even greater wheat harvest next year.

Soon after the summer harvest this year, the broad masses of agricultural workers began deep plowing to prepare for sowing wheat. Many agricultural workers and technical personnel also exchanged experiences in wheat cultivation. This year, 85% of the national wheat sowing area will use high-yielding and drought-resistant varieties.

Since the beginning of October, most regions of the country have received several autumn rains, and agricultural workers in various places have seized the favorable agricultural time to accelerate wheat sowing.

To strive for increased wheat production next year, the masses are actively building irrigation and drainage canals, accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer.

Currently, wheat sowing work across the country is about to be completed. Regions that have not completed wheat sowing are now mobilizing all sowing machines, draft animals, and manpower to work day and night to complete the sowing.

To implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania on developing draft animals and dairy cows, and to ensure greater development of animal husbandry next year, the broad masses of agricultural workers are sowing alfalfa and other fodder crops while sowing wheat. It is estimated that the sowing area of fodder crops this year will be 18% larger than last year.

In the midst of the hot production campaign, Albanian women have played an important role. They actively participate in various agricultural labors and strive to achieve abundant grain production. This is a picture of women in Mirdita opening up wasteland.

　　阿尔巴尼亚水稻获良好收成
    阿农业劳动者正在加紧进行秋种，争取明年小麦更大丰收
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚都拉斯、萨兰达、斯库台等区的农业劳动者，响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会关于增加粮食生产的战斗号召，发挥人的因素，选用和推广先进的农艺经验，今年在水稻生产方面获得了良好的收成。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，大面积种植水稻还是近几年才开始的。几年以前，阿尔巴尼亚全国仅五个区种植水稻。现在，全国已有十个区种植这种粮食作物，种植面积有了显著的扩大。水稻的单位面积产量也在逐年提高。一九六○年全国水稻平均每公顷收获十五点五公担（即相当于每亩约二百零六斤），而一九六七年已经达到平均每公顷收获二十八公担（相当于每亩约三百七十三斤）。
    今年以来，尽管不良气候曾给水稻的播种和生长带来了一定的影响，但是由于广大农业劳动者发扬革命干劲，及时地采取了各种有效措施，水稻的生产仍然获得了良好的收成。
    位于阿尔巴尼亚最南部的萨兰达区的于尔格国营农场，今年获得了平均每公顷五十公担（相当于每亩约六百六十六斤）的好收成，创造了这个农场历年来水稻产量的最高纪录。
    著名的水稻产地都拉斯区，预计今年水稻的产量平均每公顷可达五十二公担（相当于每亩约六百九十三斤），有些农业合作社可达到每公顷七十公担到八十公担（相当于每亩约九百三十三斤到一千零六十六斤）。
    近年来才开始广泛种植水稻的培拉特区，今年平均每公顷水稻产量预计可超过原计划六公担（相当于每亩超过原计划八十斤）。
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚农业劳动者积极响应劳动党的号召，正在加紧进行秋种，为明年的农业丰收打下坚实的基础。
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业合作社社员和国营农场工人在劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志提出的关于“粮食自给”的战斗口号鼓舞下，在取得今年粮食丰收的丰富经验的基础上，正在加紧播种小麦，争取明年小麦更大的丰收。
    早在今年夏收以后，广大农业劳动者就开犁深耕，准备播种小麦。许多农业劳动者和科学技术干部还交流了小麦种植经验。今年，全国计划百分之八十五的小麦播种面积采用产量高和抗旱抗涝能力强的优良品种。
    从十月上旬开始，全国大部分地区陆续下了几场秋雨，各地农业劳动者便抓紧有利农时，加速播种小麦。
    各地群众为了争取明年小麦增产，还积极修建排灌渠道，加紧积肥、运肥和施肥。
    现在，全国小麦播种工作即将结束，没有完成小麦播种工作的地区，目前正在动员所有的播种机、耕牛和人力日夜进行抢种。
    为了贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央关于发展耕牛和奶牛的决议，保证明年畜牧业有更大的发展，广大农业劳动者在播种小麦的同时，还加紧播种苜蓿等饲料作物。预计今年饲料作物播种面积将比去年扩大百分之十八。（附图片）
    在火热的生产高潮中，阿尔巴尼亚的妇女起了重要作用。她们积极参加各种农业劳动，为夺取粮食丰产而努力奋斗。这是米尔迪塔妇女在开垦荒地。
