"Down with Liu Shaoqi!" "Thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of building the party!" The kitchen brigade's "Daily Criticism" battle has begun again!

Communist Party member and veteran kitchen brigade leader Meng Guangchen led the entire brigade in studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "Serve the people wholeheartedly." He then said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's spread of the 'theory of entering the party to become an official,' smashing it to smithereens."

As soon as the old brigade leader finished speaking, new soldier Du Chongqing immediately opened fire. He indignantly criticized, "Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of entering the party to become an official' is poison coated with sugar. He wants us to sweetly fall into his trap. I will use my fire shovel to expose the black bottom of the 'theory of entering the party to become an official.' I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and serve the people wholeheartedly..."

Little Du is a new soldier who enlisted in March. After joining the army, under the cultivation and education of the party branch, he quickly joined the Communist Party of China.

Just then, a comrade from his former factory sent him a letter saying that the factory had established a revolutionary committee, and a comrade who had rebelled at the same time as him had become the head of the revolutionary committee. If Little Du had not enlisted in the army, the position of the head would definitely have been his, and he might have become a standing committee member of the municipal revolutionary committee. Yes! Little Du thought, but now I am just a kitchen soldier. "We Communists are not here to become officials, but to make revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings suddenly rang in his ears. Little Du immediately realized that an instant of selfish thoughts was the residue of Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of entering the party to become an official' at work. He then reported this to the brigade leader. The brigade leader enthusiastically studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with him, jointly criticized Liu Shaoqi, and reminisced about past hardships and sweetness. In the old society, Little Du's parents were forced to work for the capitalist, dying tragically and leaving Little Du, an orphan, with no one to rely on. It was Chairman Mao who saved him from the pit of fire, giving him the happiness of today. The old brigade leader said to him, "We must not forget our roots! We are revolutionaries, not to become officials and lords, but for the cause of communism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you rebelled against the capitalist roaders in the factory to defend Chairman Mao. Today, you are cooking in the army, also defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Through daily study of Chairman Mao's teachings and daily purging of Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of entering the party to become an official,' Little Du's heart became redder and redder. He endured hardships and, in response to Chairman Mao's call to 'save on coal and make revolution,' made dozens of stove improvements, reducing coal consumption by 40% compared to before. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, he advanced in great strides.

Little Du, with his personal experience, angrily exposed the crimes of the 'theory of entering the party to become an official,' giving Liu Shaoqi a resounding slap in the face!

The criticism meeting became more and more lively, with the entire brigade eagerly speaking out and joining the battle.

As the time drew near, old brigade leader Meng Guangchen finally said, "Today's criticism meeting was a success! The essence of Liu Shaoqi's spread of the 'theory of entering the party to become an official' is to attempt to turn our party members into revisionists, becoming his tools for restoring capitalism. We revolutionary soldiers must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, using actual actions to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of entering the party to become an official.' We will not stand down until the residue is purged!"

In the song "The Great Sea Needs a Helmsman," the "Daily Criticism" ended, and the comrades, holding the Little Red Book, went to the stove, wielding their iron shovels, and the stove fire burned even redder and brighter...

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

　　心红火旺
    “打倒刘少奇！”“彻底批判修正主义建党路线！”炊事班“天天批”的战斗又打响了！
    共产党员、老炊事班长孟广臣首先带领全班学习毛主席的教导：“全心全意地为人民服务”。接着说：“我们要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，彻底批判刘少奇所散布的‘入党做官论’，把它砸个稀巴烂。”
    老班长的话音刚落，新战士杜崇庆抢先开火。他无比愤慨地批道：“刘少奇鼓吹的‘入党做官论’，是糖拌的砒霜。他妄图要我们甜滋滋地上当。我要用烧火铲，把‘入党做官论’的黑底戳穿。坚决遵照毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务。……”
    小杜是今年三月份入伍的新战士。入伍后，在党支部的培养教育下，很快加入了中国共产党。
    正在这时，原先所在厂的同志给他来了信，说厂里成立了革委会，和他同时造反的一位同志当上了革委会主任。要是小杜不参军，主任的位子一定是小杜的，市革委会的常委也可能当上。是啊！小杜想，可是现在我当了个炊事兵。“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。毛主席的教导顿时在耳边响起。小杜立刻觉察到，一瞬间的私心杂念是刘少奇“入党做官论”的流毒在作怪。于是他向班长汇报了这事。班长热情地同他一起学习“老三篇”，一起狠批刘少奇，一起忆苦思甜。在万恶的旧社会，小杜的父母被迫给资本家做工，悲惨死去，抛下小杜这个孤儿，无依无靠。是毛主席把他从火坑里救出来，才有幸福的今天。老班长对他说：“咱可不能忘了本啊！我们干革命，不是为了做官当老爷，而是为了共产主义事业。无产阶级文化大革命中，你在厂里造走资派的反，是为了保卫毛主席。今天，你在部队烧火，也是捍卫毛主席的革命路线。”通过天天学习毛主席的教导，天天肃清刘少奇“入党做官论”的流毒，小杜的心越炼越红。他吃苦耐劳，为了响应毛主席“节约闹革命”的伟大号召，进行几十次改灶，使耗煤量比原来降低了百分之四十。他在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下大踏步前进。
    小杜以自己的切身体会，愤怒揭露“入党做官论”的罪恶，给了刘少奇一记响亮的耳光！
    批判会越开越热烈，全班争着发言，一齐上阵。
    眼看时间将到，老班长孟广臣最后说：“今天的批判会开得好！刘少奇所散布的‘入党做官论’的要害就是妄图把我们党员变成修正主义分子，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。我们革命战士要永远忠于毛主席，以实际行动狠批刘少奇的‘入党做官论’。不把流毒肃清，我们决不收兵！”
    在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中，“天天批”结束了，同志们手捧宝书，来到炉前，舞动铁铲，炉火烧得更红更旺……
