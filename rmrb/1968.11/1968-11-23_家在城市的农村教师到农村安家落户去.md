Rural Teachers from Urban Families Relocate to the Countryside

Public primary schools have been transferred to the management of production brigades, and teachers' salaries have been converted to work points. This helps in the ideological transformation of teachers. However, we have noticed a practical problem that needs to be addressed. Our neighbor, who originally taught in Hangzhou, was transferred to a public primary school in the countryside due to work needs. His wife and children are still in the city, and he bears a significant portion of the family's monthly living expenses. The cost of living in the city is different from that in the countryside. Converting salaries to work points will cause his family to face real difficulties in meeting their monthly living expenses. We believe that this special situation cannot be resolved solely through state subsidies. We believe that there are many teachers in similar situations to our neighbor. These teacher comrades can bring their families to the countryside to settle down. The countryside is a vast expanse. Some family members who have nothing to do in the city can participate in some production labor in the countryside, according to specific circumstances. This not only contributes to the creation of social wealth but also increases family income, which is a win-win situation.

    家在城市的农村教师到农村安家落户去
    公办小学下放到大队办，教师工资改为记工分，这有助于教师的思想革命化。但是，我们看到有一个实际问题需要解决。我们家有个邻居，原来在杭州市教书，因工作需要调到农村的一个公办小学教书，爱人和孩子仍在市内，每月的家庭生活靠他负担一大部分。城市的支出和农村不同，把工资改成记工分，他家的每月生活就要发生实际困难。我们认为这种特殊情况，光靠国家补助不是办法。我们认为：和我邻居有类似情况的教师是不少的，这些教师同志，可以把家属带到农村去安家落户。农村是一个广阔的天地，有些家属住在城市里没有事干，而到了农村，就可以根据具体情况参加一些生产劳动，既可为社会生产财富，又可以增加家庭收入，是一件一举两得的事情。　吴为民　傅钱生
