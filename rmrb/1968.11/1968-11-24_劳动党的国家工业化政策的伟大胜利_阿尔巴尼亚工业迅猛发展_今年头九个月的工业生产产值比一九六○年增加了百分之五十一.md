The People's Republic of Albania's industry is developing rapidly. In the first nine months of this year, industrial production value increased by 51 percent compared to 1960. This is a great victory for the economic policy of industrialization implemented by the Labor Party of Albania. It is a victory achieved through resolute struggle against the hostile actions of imperialists and revisionists who obstruct Albania's socialist construction.

During the third and the first three years of the fourth five-year plan, Albanian workers discovered and exploited several new mineral deposits. They also built oil refineries and ore processing plants. The establishment of these new factories and mines not only expanded existing industrial sectors but also created new heavy industries such as copper smelting, iron smelting, chemical industry, and mechanical industry, ushering Albania into a new stage of heavy industry development. Compared to 1960, this year's oil extraction is expected to increase by more than 51 percent, refined oil by 1.2 times, copper by 4.3 times, electricity production by 2.5 times, and coal production by more than 73 percent.

Meanwhile, to better meet the growing needs of the people for consumer goods, light industry and food industry have also made significant progress. Compared to 1960, this year's expected growth is as follows: cotton and wool textiles by 57 percent, shoes by 2.5 times, food by about one time, and canned fish by 70 percent.

With the establishment of new industrial sectors, national industry has begun to provide black metals, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, caustic soda and soda ash, refined copper, copper wire, brass, and fiberboard, among other products. These products have significantly changed the quality of the industrial structure, strengthening the role of the leading sectors of the national economy.

To accelerate socialist construction, Albania is currently building new factories and mines, such as the Vodje hydroelectric power station, glass factory, light bulb factory, machinery factory, and new mines for increased coal and copper production.

In recent years, Albania has established new industrial sectors and built dozens of large enterprises. Today, Albania can fully utilize its own resources, process large quantities of crude oil, copper, iron, and agricultural raw materials, produce a large number of machines and technical equipment, and build joint ventures, factories, hydroelectric power stations, and railways.

The rapid development of Albania's industry is a brilliant achievement of the Albanian people's self-reliance policy.

Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and the revolutionary movement he initiated, Albania's industrial production is flourishing more than ever.

Albanian workers are celebrating these achievements in industry, welcoming the 56th anniversary of national independence (November 28) and the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation (November 29).

	According to a report from the Albanian News Agency, to implement the resolution of the Labor Party of Albania to achieve rural electrification nationwide by November 8, 1971, the 30th anniversary of the party's founding, Albania is building three new factories to produce power poles.

	These three new factories are being built in Tirana, Shkodër, and Gjirokastër. Currently, the construction of these factories is progressing rapidly.

	In addition to producing power poles, these factories will also produce materials needed for building bridges and other structures.

	At present, efforts are being made to train cadres to manage these new factories. These cadres will receive professional training at the existing power pole factory in Tirana.

    劳动党的国家工业化政策的伟大胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚工业迅猛发展
    今年头九个月的工业生产产值比一九六○年增加了百分之五十一
    据新华社地拉那二十三日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的工业迅猛发展。今年头九个月工业生产的产值比一九六○年增加了百分之五十一。这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在国家工业化方面所执行的经济政策的伟大胜利，是通过同帝国主义者和修正主义者阻挠阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设的敌对行动进行坚决斗争而取得的胜利。
    在第三个五年计划期间和第四个五年计划的前三年中，阿尔巴尼亚劳动者发现了一些新矿藏并进行开采，同时他们还建成了一些石油炼油厂和加工矿石的工厂。由于这些新的厂矿的建成，不仅使原有的工业部门扩大了，而且还建立了新的重工业部门：炼铜工业、炼铁工业、化学工业、机械工业等等，使阿尔巴尼亚进入了重工业发展的新阶段。同一九六○年相比，今年开采的石油将增加百分之五十一以上，精炼的石油将增加一点二倍，泡铜将增加四点三倍，电力生产将增加二点五倍，煤产量将增加百分之七十三以上。
    与此同时，为了不断地更好地满足人民在消费品方面日益增长的需要，轻工业和食品工业也有了重大的发展。
    同一九六○年相比，今年预计的增长情况如下：棉、毛纺织品百分之五十七，鞋两倍半，食品约一倍，鱼罐头百分之七十。
    由于建立了一些新的工业部门，国家工业已经开始提供黑色金属、氮肥和磷肥、烧碱和纯碱、精炼铜、铜丝、黄铜、纤维板等等。这些产品使工业结构在质量上发生了很大的变化，加强了全国经济的主导部门的作用。
    为了加速社会主义建设，现在阿尔巴尼亚还在建设新的厂矿，如沃德耶水力发电站、玻璃工厂、电灯泡厂、机械工厂，以及一些增产煤和铜的新的厂矿等。
    这几年来，阿尔巴尼亚建立了一些新的工业部门，新建了几十个大型企业。阿尔巴尼亚今天已经能够充分利用本国的资源；能够大量加工原油、铜、铁和农业原料；能够生产大量机器、技术设备；能够修建联合企业、工厂、水电站和铁路。
    阿尔巴尼亚工业的迅速发展是阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持自力更生政策取得的辉煌成果。
    在阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志亲自发动的革命化运动的带动下，阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产正在出现更加欣欣向荣的景象。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人正以工业方面的这些成就，迎接宣布民族独立五十六周年（十一月二十八日），迎接阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年（十一月二十九日）。
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，为实现阿尔巴尼亚劳动党关于在一九七一年十一月八日建党三十周年之际实现全国农村电气化的决议，阿尔巴尼亚正在建设三个生产电线杆的新工厂。
    这三个新工厂建设在地拉那、斯库台和吉诺卡斯特，现在，建厂工程进展很快。
    这些工厂除了生产电线杆之外，还将生产建筑桥梁等所需要的材料。
    目前，正在筹备培训管理这些新工厂的干部。这些干部将在地拉那现有的电线杆工厂中进行专业训练。
