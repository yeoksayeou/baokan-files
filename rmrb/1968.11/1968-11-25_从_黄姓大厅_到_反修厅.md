The slogans "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" "Never forget class struggle!" "Never forget the Communist Party when you rise up, never forget Chairman Mao when you are happy!" echoed through the "Anti-Revisionism Hall" of the Jianbei Production Brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants were holding a live criticism meeting here.

Originally, this venue was a clan temple called the "Hall of the Yellow Clan." In the Jianbei Production Brigade, the majority of people are surnamed Yellow. Before liberation, the landlord class used feudal clan ideology to carry out feudal rule, and the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was their "court" for oppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants. After liberation, under the protection of Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle," this hall remained unchanged. A small handful of class enemies used the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" to continue spreading feudal clan ideology, splitting the unity of the poor and lower-middle peasants, inciting clan fights, and allowing them to long occupy the leadership of the brigade and carry out capitalist restoration activities. In 1962, when Liu Shaoqi advocated the fallacies of "agriculture should retreat enough" and "the smaller the scale, the better," a small handful of class enemies used clan relationships to peddle Liu Shaoqi's black goods, dismantle the collective economy, and undermine the foundations of socialism. A rich peasant element from the original Ninth Production Team even shouted, "Can we Yellows be managed by the small Yellows? The big Yellows have no one who can be the team leader?" Thus, one team was split into two.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a group of Red Guards seized the "Hall of the Yellow Clan," smashing the ancestral tablets, plaques, and other items inside to smithereens. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants have dragged several impostors who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and instigated fights, as well as counter-revolutionary rich peasants and murderers, to the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" to denounce their crimes and criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle."

Poor peasant Huang Jiajiu's father, Huang Maocai, with a heart full of anger, denounced, "Before liberation, the landlords directed fights here and also extorted money from us. We were so poor that we had no food to eat, let alone money! When Jiajiu's mother said she had no money, they tied her up here and beat her to death..."

Jiajiu suddenly stood up, pointing at a scoundrel's nose, angrily saying, "The murderer is him! This bastard beat my mother to death with a stick. Over the years, this troublemaker, under the cover of Liu Shaoqi's theory of the 'extinction of class struggle' and the protection of a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, became an accountant, and was even called an 'active element.' They used their authority to adopt the treacherous methods of 'dividing, eating, and using everything up' to sabotage our collective economy. Can we say that class struggle has been extinguished? We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Never forget class struggle!'"

Jiajiu's younger brother stood up to criticize;
Jiajiu's wife stood up to criticize;
One after another, the poor and lower-middle peasants stood up to criticize.

They fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, denouncing the landlords' and rich peasants' bloody crimes of oppressing and exploiting the poor and lower-middle peasants. They pointed out deeply, "Liu Shaoqi spread the theory of the 'extinction of class struggle' to shield a bunch of turtles and crabs, aiming to restore capitalism. If we do not overthrow this reactionary fallacy and expose these ghosts and monsters, allowing their plots to succeed, we will have to go back on our path, suffer twice, and become slaves again."

The revolutionary criticism became more and more profound, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle," fundamentally shaking the feudal clan ideology that had bound the peasants for thousands of years, making the poor and lower-middle peasants see more clearly the reactionary essence of the class enemies who obliterate class and class struggle, using "clan kinship" to replace "class kinship." They repeatedly recalled and compared, using a large number of bloody facts to denounce the evil deeds of the "Hall of the Yellow Clan":

The "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was a "killing ground" and "hell," where landlords tortured and killed the poor and lower-middle peasants;
The "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was a "rent collection office," where landlords extorted rent and debts from the poor and lower-middle peasants, forcing them to sell their wives and children;
The "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was a "gambling den," where landlords and rich peasants lived in luxury, and Daoists performed rituals and engaged in feudal superstitions;
The "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was a "fight command center," where the landlord class instigated fights, with the literary bureau (external liaison) and military bureau (arsenal) located here.

Poor peasant Yuan Tuicai and others pointed out sharply: Before liberation, the landlord class ruled arbitrarily in the "Hall of the Yellow Clan." After liberation, the class enemies, relying on Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle," used "clan kinship" to replace "class kinship," using the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" to do evil deeds, stirring up conflicts among class brothers, and attempting to ride on our heads again. We will not allow it! The river is deep, the sea is deep, but class friendship is deeper. We must turn "clan kinship" into "class kinship." The poor and lower-middle peasants unite and firmly suppress a small handful of class enemies.

"Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the hall!" A suggestion from a poor and lower-middle peasant reflected everyone's urgent wish.

From then on, the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" was completely transformed: A large plaque with red background and gold characters was hung at the entrance: "Anti-Revisionism Hall." Inside, portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao were hung everywhere. The "Hall of the Yellow Clan" became the "Anti-Revisionism Hall," where the poor and lower-middle peasants criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents; the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" became the "Propaganda Hall," where the poor and lower-middle peasants sang praises to Chairman Mao, sang praises to Mao Zedong Thought, and sang praises to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" became the "Self-Criticism Hall," where the poor and lower-middle peasants fiercely fought against selfishness, promoted the revolutionization of thought, and completely, thoroughly served the people; the "Hall of the Yellow Clan" became the "Loyalty Hall," where the poor and lower-middle peasants recalled bitterness and sweetness, conducted class education, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and pledged loyalty to Chairman Mao.

### 从“黄姓大厅”到“反修厅”

    从“黄姓大厅”到“反修厅”
    “打倒刘少奇！”“千万不要忘记阶级斗争！”“翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席！”的口号声响彻建陂大队的“反修厅”。贫下中农正在这里举行现场批判会。
    这个会场原来是一个祠堂，叫做“黄姓大厅”。建陂大队姓黄的占多数。解放前，地主阶级利用封建宗族思想，实行封建统治，“黄姓大厅”就是他们向贫下中农专政的“法庭”。解放后，在刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的保护下，这个大厅原封未动。一小撮阶级敌人利用“黄姓大厅”继续散布封建宗族思想，分裂贫下中农的团结，挑动宗族械斗，使他们能够长期窃据大队的领导权，进行资本主义复辟活动。一九六二年，刘少奇宣扬什么“农业要退够”“规模越小越好”的谬论，一小撮阶级敌人就利用宗族关系，贩卖刘少奇的黑货，拆集体经济的台，挖社会主义墙脚。原第九生产队的一个富农分子就叫嚷什么“我们大黄还能受小黄管，大黄没有人能当队长？”这样，一个队拆成两个。
    无产阶级文化大革命初期，一批红卫兵小将占领了“黄姓大厅”，把里面的神位、匾额等统统砸个稀烂。现在，贫下中农又把几个混进革命队伍、策动械斗的伪保长、反动富农、杀人凶手拉到“黄姓大厅”，控诉他们的罪行，批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    贫农黄价九的父亲黄茂财带着满腔的怒火，控诉说：“解放前，地主在这里指挥械斗，还向我们兜钱。我们穷得饭都没有吃，哪来钱！价九娘说声没有，他们就把价九娘绑在这里拷打，把她活活打死。……”
    价九猛地一下站起来，指着一个家伙的鼻子，愤怒地说：“杀人凶手就是他！就是这个坏家伙一扁担把我娘打死。这些年来，这个文打官司武打架的家伙，在刘少奇的‘阶级斗争熄灭论’掩护下，在党内一小撮走资派的包庇下，混进了革命队伍，当了会计，还是个什么‘积极分子’。他们利用职权，采取‘分光、吃光、用光’的阴险手段，破坏我们的集体经济。这能说阶级斗争熄灭了吗？我们要牢记毛主席的教导：‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’！”
    价九的弟弟站出来批判；
    价九的媳妇站出来批判；
    一个个贫下中农站出来批判。
    他们满怀阶级仇恨狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论，控诉地主、富农压迫剥削贫下中农的血腥罪行。他们深刻指出：“刘少奇散布‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，就是为了包庇一些乌龟王八，复辟资本主义。如果不批倒这个反动谬论，不把这些牛鬼蛇神揪出来，让他们的阴谋得逞，我们就要走回头路，吃二遍苦，重新做牛马。”
    革命的大批判越来越深入，批判刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”，从根本上动摇了千百年来束缚农民的封建宗族思想，使贫下中农更加看清了阶级敌人抹煞阶级和阶级斗争，利用“宗族亲”代替“阶级亲”的反动实质。他们一次又一次地回忆对比，以大量血淋淋的事实控诉了“黄姓大厅”的罪恶：
    “黄姓大厅”是“杀人场”“阎王殿”，地主吊打、杀害贫下中农在大厅；
    “黄姓大厅”是“收租院”，地主向贫下中农逼租逼债在大厅，贫下中农卖妻卖儿在大厅；
    “黄姓大厅”是“聚赌场”，地主、富农花天酒地生活在大厅，道士打醮搞封建迷信活动在大厅；
    “黄姓大厅”是“械斗指挥所”，地主阶级搞械斗，文局（对外联络）武局（武器库）在大厅。
    贫农袁推财等一针见血地指出：解放前，地主阶级在“黄姓大厅”作威作福。解放后，阶级敌人仗着刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，用“宗族亲”代替“阶级亲”，利用“黄姓大厅”干坏事，挑动我们阶级兄弟之间闹矛盾，妄想再骑在我们头上，我们决不答应！河深海深不如阶级友爱深，我们要把“宗族亲”变成“阶级亲”。贫下中农团结起来，坚决镇压一小撮阶级敌人。
    “让毛泽东思想占领大厅！”一个贫下中农的提议，反映了大家的迫切愿望。
    从此，“黄姓大厅”面目焕然一新：门口挂上了红底金字的大匾：“反修厅”，里面挂满了毛主席像和毛主席语录。“黄姓大厅”变成了“反修厅”，贫下中农在这里批判刘少奇及其代理人；“黄姓大厅”变成了“宣传厅”，贫下中农在这里大歌大颂毛主席，大歌大颂毛泽东思想，大歌大颂毛主席的革命路线；“黄姓大厅”变成了“斗私厅”，贫下中农在这里狠斗私字，促进思想革命化，完全彻底为人民；“黄姓大厅”变成了“献忠厅”，贫下中农在这里忆苦思甜，进行阶级教育，落实毛主席的最新指示，向毛主席献忠心。
