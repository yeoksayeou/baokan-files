	Recently, you have moved the public-run primary schools to the production brigades to manage, and changed the teachers' salaries from state-funded to work points recorded by the brigade. This is a completely revolutionary action, and we revolutionary soldiers wholeheartedly support it.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi has been brazenly opposing our great leader Chairman Mao, stubbornly pushing the thoroughly reactionary bourgeois education line. Do you remember? Before I enlisted, I worked in a school that was controlled by capitalist-roaders who loyally carried out the revisionist education line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. The school had become a tool for Liu Shaoqi to restore capitalism. The capitalist-roaders in the school formulated a system of "early morning reading" and "evening review" in the school, making it a "school rule." Anyone who violated it would be criticized, punished, and even expelled. Students were tied to the school from morning to night for "closed-door studying," causing them to be alienated from the poor and lower-middle peasants and from productive labor, gradually losing the poor and lower-middle peasants' love for labor. A student in Class 1, Grade 6, originally a hardworking and thrifty poor peasant's child, became a nearsighted, hunched-back student who did not want to participate in labor and cared about clothing after entering school.

	To change the old face of the school, we led the students to actively participate in class struggle and productive labor outside the school. However, the capitalist-roaders in the school labeled us as "showing off" and "violating school rules." Some comrades were even demoted. Once, a grass stack near the school caught fire. Upon hearing the news, I immediately led a class of students to fight the fire, missing two hours of classes. Upon returning, the capitalist-roaders saw us covered in dust, with black and white patches on our faces, and scolded us: "Look at your appearance, you are simply not doing your job properly!"

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has brought about earth-shaking changes in the educational front. Now, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, you have moved the public-run primary schools to the brigades to manage. This is a concrete action to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian education line and be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. You must always run schools according to the will of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    要永远按照贫下中农的心意办学凤英：
    最近，你们把公办小学下放到生产大队去办，并把教师由国家发工资改为大队记工分。这完全是革命的行动，我们革命战士一千个拥护，一万个支持。
    毛主席教导我们说：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”可是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇猖狂地和我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，一直顽固地推行反动透顶的资产阶级教育路线。你还记得吗？入伍前我曾工作过的那个学校，由于走资派掌握学校大权，忠实地执行大叛徒刘少奇那条修正主义教育路线，使学校完全变成了刘少奇复辟资本主义的工具。学校走资派为了把学生培养成为资产阶级接班人，制定了一个到学校“早读”和“晚复习”的制度，并作为“校规”，谁违犯就要挨批评，受处分，甚至开除学籍。学生从早到晚被拴在学校里“闭门读书”，使学生脱离了贫下中农，脱离了生产劳动，逐渐地失去了贫下中农爱劳动的本色。六年级一班有个学生，原是一个勤劳俭朴的贫农孩子。可是，入学后，却成了一个近视眼、驼背，不愿参加劳动，讲究穿戴的学生。
    为了改变旧学校的这种面貌，我们领着学生积极参加校外阶级斗争、生产劳动，可是学校走资派却给我们扣上“出风头”、“违犯校规”等帽子，有的同志还被降了级。有一次，学校附近一个生产队的草垛失火了。我闻讯后，立即带领一个班学生去参加灭火的战斗，误了两个小时的课程。回来后，走资派看到我们弄得满身灰尘，脸上黑一块白一块的，就训斥起来：“看你们这个鬼样子，简直是不务正业！”
    毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使教育阵地起了翻天覆地的变化。现在，你们在贫下中农的帮助下，把公办小学下放到大队去办，这是执行毛主席无产阶级教育路线、忠于伟大领袖毛主席的具体行动，你要永远按照贫下中农的心意办学。
