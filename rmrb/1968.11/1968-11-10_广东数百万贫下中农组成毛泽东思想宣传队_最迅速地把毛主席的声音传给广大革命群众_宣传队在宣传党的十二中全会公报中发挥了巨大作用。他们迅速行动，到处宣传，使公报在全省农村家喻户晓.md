Millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangdong have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to swiftly convey Chairman Mao's voice to the revolutionary masses. These teams have played a significant role in propagating the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. They acted swiftly, spreading the word everywhere, making the communiqué known to every household in the rural areas of the province.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong Province's network of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, composed of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, has played a crucial role in propagating and implementing the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. This has been warmly praised by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary groups.

On the evening of the publication of the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the entire rural area of Guangdong, from Hainan Island to the Chaozhou-Shantou Plain, from the Pearl River Delta to the foothills of the Nanling Mountains, saw eight prefectures and administrative regions mobilize tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of poor and lower-middle peasants. These propaganda teams swiftly launched propaganda activities. Some carried torches, while others walked under the moonlight, delivering the communiqué to every corner, even the most remote and inaccessible production teams and villages. In Huicheng Prefecture, within 24 hours of the publication of the communiqué, over 500,000 poor and lower-middle peasants in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, with hearts full of excitement, swiftly took action and spread the word everywhere, making the communiqué known to every household in this prefecture of four million people. Some elderly poor peasants in Xinguang Production Brigade of Tanhu Commune in Huicheng County listened to the propaganda team's explanation of the communiqué on the evening of November 1 and were deeply moved. They said to the propaganda team, "In the past, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents blocked Chairman Mao's voice from reaching us poor and lower-middle peasants. They deserve to die a thousand deaths! Tonight, you have traveled more than ten miles without rest, quickly bringing Chairman Mao's voice to us. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and our greatest happiness."

Due to the extensive and in-depth propaganda activities of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has become widely known in the rural areas of Guangdong. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary groups, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum with unprecedented scale. They have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation. The revolutionary criticism in the rural areas of Guangdong is in full swing. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Xinhui County have set up more than 4,700 revolutionary criticism columns. Currently, the rural areas of Guangdong are about to enter the late rice harvest season. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to make the late rice harvest and sell surplus grain a concrete action to implement the communiqué.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" regarding the popularization of political propaganda: "Simple slogans, pictures, and speeches make the peasants feel as if they have all attended a political school, with very broad and quick effects." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a massive movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has swept through the rural areas of Guangdong. In this movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's instructions on popularizing political propaganda, have universally organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, forming a network of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda in the rural areas of the province. They have swiftly and extensively spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every corner, playing a significant role in uniting the revolutionary masses, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong. Since the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in Guangdong Province, this large propaganda force, with the support and help of the revolutionary committees at various levels, has been further consolidated and developed politically and organizationally. Currently, the number of poor and lower-middle peasants participating in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the rural areas of the province has reached several million.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangdong are organized at all levels from county to commune, brigade, and production team. In the rural areas of Guangdong, from county to commune to brigade, there are generally radio and telephone communication equipment, but the production teams lack these equipment. To make Chairman Mao's latest instructions meet the revolutionary masses as swiftly as possible, the most important thing is still to rely on the propaganda teams at the brigade and production team levels. Therefore, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of poor and lower-middle peasants are most numerous at these two levels. Taking Huicheng Prefecture as an example, each brigade has about 15 to 20 people, and each production team has about 5 to 10 people. These propaganda teams at the two levels are generally led by brigade and production team cadres, militia cadres, and representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants association.

Currently, the experience of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of Guangdong is being continuously improved and developed. Many places, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, combined with local conditions, are summarizing the experience of organizing propaganda teams.

    广东数百万贫下中农组成毛泽东思想宣传队
    最迅速地把毛主席的声音传给广大革命群众
    宣传队在宣传党的十二中全会公报中发挥了巨大作用。他们迅速行动，到处宣传，使公报在全省农村家喻户晓
    据新华社广州九日电　广东省农村由数百万贫下中农组成的毛泽东思想宣传队构成的宣传网，在宣传贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报中，发挥了巨大的作用，受到了广大贫下中农和革命群众的热烈赞扬。
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的当天晚上，广东全省农村从海南岛到潮汕平原，从珠江三角洲到南岭山麓，八个专区、行政区都出动了十几万到几十万由贫下中农组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，迅速展开宣传活动。这些宣传大军，有的举着火把，有的踏着月色赶路，把公报送到各个地方，送到最偏僻、交通最不方便的生产队和村庄。惠阳专区从公报发表当晚到第二天，五十多万人的贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队，怀着无比激动的心情，迅速行动，到处宣传，使全会公报在这个有四百万人口的专区，一天之内做到了家喻户晓。这个专区惠阳县潼湖公社新光大队新溪生产队的一些老贫农，在十一月一日晚听了宣传队对公报的宣传，十分感动地对宣传队说：“过去，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人对我们贫下中农封锁毛主席的声音，真是罪该万死！今晚你们不辞劳苦，星夜赶了十多里路，很快就把毛主席的声音传给我们，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是我们贫下中农的最大幸福。”
    由于贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队连日来广泛深入地展开宣传活动，党的八届十二中全会公报已在广东农村家喻户晓。广大贫下中农和革命群众怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，正以实际行动全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，他们以前所未有的规模，兴起了革命大批判和斗、批、改的新高潮。全省农村革命大批判正在如火如荼地展开，新会县的贫下中农人人口诛笔伐叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，全县新办起了四千七百多个革命大批判专栏。目前，广东农村即将进入晚稻收获季节，广大贫下中农决心把搞好晚稻收获、多卖余粮作为落实公报的一项具体行动。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中谈到普及政治宣传时指出：“很简单的一些标语、图画和讲演，使得农民如同每个都进过一下子政治学校一样，收效非常之广而速。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，广东农村掀起了规模空前的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。在这一运动中，广大贫下中农遵照毛主席关于普及政治宣传的教导，普遍地组织起毛泽东思想宣传队，在全省农村形成了毛泽东思想宣传网。他们把毛主席一系列最新指示，最迅速、最广泛、最深入地传播到每个角落，对团结广大革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取广东省无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的胜利，起了巨大作用。自从广东省各级革命委员会普遍建立以后，这支人数众多的宣传队伍，在各级革委会的支持、帮助下，从政治上、组织上得到了进一步的巩固和发展，目前，全省农村参加毛泽东思想宣传队的贫下中农已达数百万人。
    广东省贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队，从县、公社到大队、生产队各级都有。在广东农村，从县、公社到大队，一般都有广播和电话通讯设备，但是生产队还缺乏这些设备，要使毛主席的最新指示最迅速地同广大革命群众见面，最重要的还是依靠大队和生产队的宣传队。因此，贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队人数最多的是大队和生产队这两级。以惠阳专区为例，每个大队大约有十五至二十人，每个生产队大约有五至十人。这两级宣传队一般都由大队和生产队干部、民兵干部和贫协代表担任领导。
    目前，广东农村贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队的经验正在不断完善和发展，许多地方以毛泽东思想为指针，结合本地的具体情况，正在总结宣传队的办队经验。
