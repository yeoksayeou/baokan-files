Inspired by the spirit of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people's hospital of Qiongzhong County established a free medical service station for the poor and middle peasants of the Li and Miao ethnic groups at the foot of the Wuzhishan Mountain on November 6. This station is a bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, a classroom for studying the communiqué, and a battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

In the previous stage, the revolutionary staff of the Qiongzhong County People's Hospital, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, formed several medical teams to go to the Li and Miao villages to treat the peasants. During the treatment, some peasants said to them, "There are many herbs on Wuzhishan Mountain. If you can pick some herbs to treat our diseases, it will not only save Western medicine but also save us money." Everyone thought that the suggestion made by the poor and middle peasants was very good. At this time, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was issued. While studying the communiqué, they linked it with the achievements made by the hospital in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praising the great victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and at the same time, they found the gaps and proposed improvement measures. At this time, someone suggested, "Can we mobilize the revolutionary staff to go up the mountain to pick herbs and set up a medical service station at the foot of Wuzhishan Mountain, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the communiqué, and to provide free medical treatment for the poor and middle peasants of the Li and Miao ethnic groups?"

The revolutionary staff of the entire hospital immediately took action. They braved the wind and rain, climbed mountains and crossed rivers to go deep into the old forests to pick herbs. The rain soaked their clothes, but they said, "This rain cannot dampen our hearts burning with service to the poor and middle peasants." The mountain leeches bit their legs until they bled, but they said, "We don't mind the pain, it's for the poor and middle peasants to suffer less." Some herbs were buried more than a meter deep in the ground and were difficult to dig out. They said, "To treat the diseases of the poor and middle peasants, even if it's deeper, we must dig out the herbs!" Some herbs were difficult to find, but they said, "To implement the battle calls of the communiqué, even if we have to trample all over Wuzhishan Mountain, we must find the herbs." In this way, after four days of hard work, they finally picked enough herbs and established a medical service station at the foot of Wuzhishan Mountain.

Every time the poor and middle peasants of the Li and Miao ethnic groups came to the service station to see a doctor, the medical staff and the peasants first together wished Chairman Mao a long life! Together they studied the communiqué and criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist medical and health line. The peasants took the packets of herbs, moved to tears, raised the red books, and in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, repeatedly shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The establishment of this medical service station quickly spread throughout the Li and Miao villages at the foot of Wuzhishan Mountain. Now, the medical staff of various communes and farms are also actively going up the mountain to pick herbs, preparing to establish more medical service stations.

    五指山下的一个中医服务站
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，琼中县人民医院于十一月六日在五指山下设立了一个为黎、苗族贫下中农免费治疗的中医服务站。这个站是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，是学习公报的课堂，又是革命大批判的战场。
    海南岛琼中县人民医院的革命职工，前一个阶段在解放军支左人员的帮助下组成了若干个医疗队，到黎村苗寨去给贫下中农治病。在治疗过程中，有的贫下中农对他们说：“五指山上草药多，你们如果能采些草药给我们治病，既能节省西药，又给我们省了钱。”大家听了觉得贫下中农提的这条意见很好。这时，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。大家在学习公报时，一面联系本院在文化大革命中取得的成果，大颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，一面联系公报提出的各项战斗号召，大找差距，同时提出改进措施。这时有人建议，是不是可以发动广大革命职工上山采药，在五指山下设一个中医服务站，一面宣传毛泽东思想，宣传公报，一面为黎、苗族贫下中农免费治病。
    全院革命职工立即行动起来了。他们顶风冒雨，爬山涉水到深山老林里去采药。大雨淋湿了衣服，他们说：“这淋不湿我们为贫下中农服务的火热的心。”山蚂蝗咬得腿上直流血，他们说：“我们受点痛没什么，为的是让贫下中农少受些痛苦。”有些草药埋在一米多深的地下，很难挖。他们说：“为了给贫下中农治病，就是再深也要把药挖出来！”有些草药很难找，他们说：“为了落实公报的战斗号召，就是踏遍五指山也要把药找到。”就这样，他们经过四天的奋战，终于采到了足够的草药，在五指山下设立了一个中医服务站。
    每当黎、苗族贫下中农来到服务站看病时，医护人员和贫下中农首先一起敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！一起学习公报，一起批判刘少奇的修正主义医疗卫生路线。贫下中农接过一包包的草药，激动得热泪盈眶，举起红彤彤的宝书，在毛主席像前，不断地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这个中医服务站的诞生，很快就传遍了五指山下的黎村苗寨。现在各公社、农场的医护人员也正在积极上山采草药，准备建立更多的中医服务站。　杨发光　琼忠东
