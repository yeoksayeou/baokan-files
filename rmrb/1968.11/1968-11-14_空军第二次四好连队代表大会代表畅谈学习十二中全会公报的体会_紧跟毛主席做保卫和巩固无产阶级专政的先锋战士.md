Representatives attending the Second Conference of the Air Force's Four Good Units in Beijing have been holding study sessions centered on the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, filled with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. Through their studies, they have significantly heightened their awareness of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship and resolved to closely follow the great commander Chairman Mao, dedicating their lives to being the vanguard warriors in defending and consolidating proletarian dictatorship. They said, before the revolution's victory, seizing power was the fundamental issue; after the revolution's victory, consolidating and strengthening the proletarian state power is also the fundamental issue. We must fully implement all the great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, further strengthen the construction of our troops, and do an even better job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives, linking the "three supports, two militaries" and preparedness work with their practical experiences, repeatedly studied the communiqué's transmission of Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is absolutely necessary and very timely for consolidating proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." They further understood that "the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power." The representative from a certain unit of the Air Force supporting the left in Tianjin's Hongqiao District, the representative from the "Steel Eighth Company" supporting the left in Wuhan, the representative from the 7350th Unit supporting the left in Hangzhou, and the representative from the "Three Victories in Three Battles" unit supporting the left in Guangxi, all shared their personal experiences and enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao for personally initiating and leading this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has brought immense happiness to hundreds of millions of people. At the same time, they vehemently criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. The more they praised, the more they felt Chairman Mao's brilliance and greatness; the more they criticized, the more they hated the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi. The representative from the unit where Lyu Xiangbi, who was previously in a certain unit in Liaocheng, Shandong, executed the task of supporting the left, recalled that before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents stuffed a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries into key positions, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the working people. He deeply felt that if one thought that seizing power meant everything was settled, our proletarian dictatorship state would still peacefully evolve into bourgeois dictatorship.

The representatives deeply understood that state power is the right to life, the right to existence. With state power, one has everything; without it, one loses everything. If one only has the idea of seizing power but lacks the idea of continuously consolidating and developing proletarian dictatorship, then one lacks the awareness of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, lacks the awareness of the two-line struggle, and is not a thorough proletarian revolutionary warrior.

The representatives said that raising the awareness of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is indeed very important for every comrade. We must deeply study and seriously understand Chairman Mao's great theory on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, firmly remember the importance of seizing state power and the danger of losing it, firmly remember our great responsibility of defending the proletarian state power, and take Li Wenzhong as an example, forever being the vanguard warriors of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship.

At the study session, everyone unanimously agreed that in the socialist historical period filled with class struggle, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating proletarian dictatorship and ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

Chen Erxun, the platoon leader of a certain anti-aircraft artillery platoon supporting the left in Lanzhou County, said, "Our platoon is dispersed in the rural areas of Lanzhou with a population of 400,000. Some squads, on average, have one soldier responsible for supporting the left in one unit. The work is arduous, and the situation is complex. Together with the revolutionary masses of Lanzhou, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we smashed the frenzied counterattack of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Lanzhou area and achieved a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. An official within the former county committee who had made serious mistakes sighed deeply and said to the soldiers of this platoon: 'In terms of seniority, my party membership is longer than your age; in terms of ideology, you are much higher, higher because you are loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and have mastered Mao Zedong Thought.'"

Everyone unanimously agreed that no matter how complex the situation, how arduous the tasks, or how intense the class struggle, whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought has the right to speak; whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought has the initiative; whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought has the leadership. Proletarian state power is the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. Everyone resolutely declared that they would take Vice Chairman Lin Biao as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and truly achieve that whoever supports Mao Zedong Thought is our friend, and whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "From the viewpoint of Marxism on the state, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to keep it must have a strong army." He also said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The representatives deeply felt from their personal experiences that the essence of state power is mainly military power. Whoever holds the military power holds the state power. The proletariat not only relies on the gun to seize power but also relies on the gun to hold and defend power. They said while fiercely criticizing the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the internal dictatorship function of the army disappearing," that under proletarian dictatorship, the role of the people's army is not smaller or less important but greater and more important. We not only bear the responsibility of defending national defense and preventing imperialist aggression externally but also bear the responsibility of consolidating proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism internally.

In discussing how to implement the plenary session's proposal of "continuously strengthening the great People's Liberation Army of China," the representatives emphasized that the tasks proposed by the plenary session are the fundamental tasks of our army's construction and are also the guiding light for creating four-good units. Currently, we must use the communiqué as a weapon to vigorously strengthen the construction of the grassroots level of the troops and strive to create more four-good units. They said, we must further consolidate national defense, continue to do a good job in supporting the military and loving the people. We must definitely liberate Taiwan. Regarding the wolf-like nature of the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, we must be a hundred times more vigilant. If any enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them.

　　空军第二次四好连队代表大会代表畅谈学习十二中全会公报的体会
　　紧跟毛主席做保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的先锋战士
　　决心全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，加强部队建设，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社十三日讯　正在北京出席人民解放军空军第二次四好连队代表大会的代表们，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，连日来举行以学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习会。代表们通过学习，极大地提高了无产阶级专政下继续革命的自觉性，决心紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，一辈子做保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的先锋战士。他们说，革命胜利前，夺取政权是革命的根本问题；革命胜利后，巩固和加强无产阶级政权也是革命的根本问题。我们一定要全面落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，进一步加强部队建设，把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    代表们联系“三支”“两军”和战备等工作的实践，反复学习了全会公报传达的毛主席的最新指示：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”进一步体会到，“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”在天津红桥区支左的空军某部代表，在武汉支左的某部“钢八连”代表，在杭州支左的七三五○部队代表，以及在广西支左的“三战三捷”部队的代表，都以自己的切身体会，热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命给亿万人民带来的巨大幸福，同时狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命罪行。他们越颂越感到毛主席英明伟大，越批对党内头号走资派刘少奇越恨。在山东聊城地区某单位执行支左任务的吕祥璧生前所在连的代表，回顾无产阶级文化大革命前，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人把一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子塞进重要岗位，对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政的严酷事实，深有感触地说，如果认为夺取了政权就万事大吉了，我们无产阶级专政的国家就仍然会和平演变为资产阶级专政。
    代表们深深体会到，政权就是生命权，就是生存权。有了政权，就有了一切；丧失了政权，就丧失了一切。如果只有夺取政权的思想，而没有不断巩固、发展无产阶级专政的思想，就是没有无产阶级专政下继续革命的觉悟，就是没有两条路线斗争的觉悟，就不是一个彻底的无产阶级革命战士。
    代表们说，提高无产阶级专政下继续革命的觉悟对每一个同志来说实在太重要了。我们一定要深入学习、认真领会毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大学说，牢牢记住掌握政权的重要性和丧失政权的危险性，牢牢记住自己保卫无产阶级政权的重大责任，以李文忠同志为榜样，永远做无产阶级专政下继续革命的先锋战士。
    学习会上大家一致认为，在充满阶级斗争的社会主义历史时期，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是巩固无产阶级专政，使无产阶级铁打江山永不变色的根本保证。
    在兰考县支左的某部高机连连长陈二勋说，我们连分散在四十万人口的兰考农村，有的班平均一个战士就要担负一个单位的支左任务，工作艰巨，情况复杂。我们和兰考的无产阶级革命派一起，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，粉碎了兰考地区党内一小撮走资派的猖狂反扑，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。旧县委内一个犯有严重错误的干部，感慨万分地对这个连的战士说：“论资格，我的党龄比你们的年龄还要长；论思想，你们比我高得多，高就高在你们忠于毛主席的革命路线，掌握了毛泽东思想。”
    大家一致认为，不论情况多么复杂，任务多么艰巨，阶级斗争多么激烈，谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就有发言权；谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就有主动权；谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就有领导权。无产阶级政权，就是毛泽东思想的领导权。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，有了毛泽东思想就有了一切。大家坚决表示，要以林彪副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，真正做到谁拥护毛泽东思想就和谁亲，谁反对毛泽东思想就和谁拚。
    毛主席教导我们：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”又说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”代表们从亲身经历中深深体会到，政权的实质，主要就是军权，军权掌握在谁的手里，谁就掌握了政权。无产阶级不仅要靠枪杆子打江山，而且要靠枪杆子坐江山、保江山。他们在狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇的“军队对内专政职能消失论”时说，在无产阶级专政下，人民军队的作用，不是小了、不重要了，而是更大了、更重要了。我们既担负着保卫国防，防止帝国主义侵略的对外职能，又担负着巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义的对内职能。
    在讨论如何贯彻执行全会提出的“必须不断加强伟大的中国人民解放军”时，代表们强调指出，全会所提出的各项任务，是我军建设的根本任务，也是创造四好连队的指路明灯。当前我们要以全会公报为武器，大力加强部队的基层建设，努力创造更多的四好连队。他们说，我们要进一步巩固国防，继续做好拥军爱民工作。一定要解放台湾。对于豺狼成性的美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团，我们一定要百倍警惕。任何敌人胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之。
