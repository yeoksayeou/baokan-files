Iraqi newspaper supports "Fatah" statement on persisting in armed struggle
People's war is the path to victory for the Palestinian people

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad
	Iraq's "Al-Nur" newspaper published a commentary on the 20th supporting the recent statement by the spokesperson of "Fatah" (Palestine National Liberation Movement) on persisting in armed struggle. The commentary said that the path of people's war will surely lead the Palestinian people to victory.

	The Iraqi newspaper published on the 19th the statement of the "Fatah" spokesperson, which said, "Fatah" rejects all so-called "peaceful solutions" to the Palestinian issue. For the Palestinian people, the so-called "peaceful solutions" only mean surrender. The statement said, "The only way to liberate the occupied land is the path of armed struggle." "The way to liberate Palestine is through the barrel of a gun."

	In commenting on this statement, "Al-Nur" said: "At a time when imperialists, Zionists, and their agents in and outside the United Nations are dreaming of forcing the Arabs to surrender, at a time when notorious figures are trying to save the mission of Yarin (the United Nations' 'special envoy' peddling the 'political solution' to the Middle East issue) from inevitable failure, in order to further lull the Arabs and give Israel enough time to rearm and prepare for new acts of aggression, the unyielding Palestinian people have declared that they reject all so-called 'peaceful solutions' and insist on fighting, because this is the only necessary and effective way to achieve victory and eliminate the Zionist occupation of Arab lands."

	The commentary said: "The statement of the 'Fatah' spokesperson clearly shows that the Palestinian people have embarked on the path that will surely lead them to victory, that is, the path of people's liberation war."

	The newspaper called for full support for the just armed struggle of the Palestinian people to recover the lands seized by Zionism and imperialism.

    伊拉克报纸支持“法塔赫”关于坚持武装斗争声明
    人民战争是巴勒斯坦人民胜利的道路
    新华社巴格达电　伊拉克《光明报》二十日发表评论，支持“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）发言人最近发表的关于坚持武装斗争的声明。评论说，走人民战争的道路定将引导巴勒斯坦人民获得胜利。
    伊拉克报纸在十九日刊登的“法塔赫”发言人的声明说，“法塔赫”拒绝一切关于巴勒斯坦问题的所谓的“和平解决”办法，对巴勒斯坦人民来说，所谓的“和平解决”办法只意味着投降。声明说，“解放被占领的土地的唯一道路是武装斗争的道路。”“枪杆子里面才出解放巴勒斯坦的办法。”
    《光明报》在评论这一声明时说：“正当帝国主义者、犹太复国主义者及其在联合国内外的代理人幻想强迫阿拉伯人接受投降的时候，正当臭名昭著的人士一心要使雅林（编者按：兜售“政治解决”中东问题骗局的联合国“特使”）的使命免于必然失败、以期进一步麻痹阿拉伯人，从而使以色列获得足够时间重新武装起来，为采取新的侵略行动作准备的时候，不屈不挠的巴勒斯坦人民表示，他们拒绝一切所谓的‘和平解决’办法，坚持战斗，因为这是取得胜利和消除犹太复国主义对阿拉伯国土占领状态的唯一必要而有效的办法。”
    评论说：“‘法塔赫’发言人的这一声明清楚地表明，巴勒斯坦人民已经走上了必将使他们取得胜利的道路，即人民解放战争的道路。”
    这家报纸要求全力支持巴勒斯坦人民为收复被犹太复国主义和帝国主义强占的土地而开展的正义武装斗争。
