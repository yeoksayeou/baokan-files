The representatives participating in the Liaoning Province Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Study and Application of Mao Zedong Thought Seminar firmly support the decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. They also respond to the call of the Plenum to deeply criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Northeast region. Below are summaries of speeches made by some representatives at a criticism meeting.

	Smash Liu Shaoqi's Counter-Revolutionary Revisionist Party-Building Line to Pieces!
	Xu Chunling, an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in Liaoning Province and Deputy Director of the Jin County Revolutionary Committee:
	The Eighth Plenum unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. We poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed to hear this news.
	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat." However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, driven by his reactionary class nature, openly declared many years ago in the Northeast: "Even if there are ten thousand rich peasant Party members in the Northeast, we are not afraid." Later, his agents in the Northeast, following his instructions, went to Jin County to "stay and work," and purged seven out of sixteen Party members in a brigade, most of whom were old poor peasants and old activists. Meanwhile, some embezzlers and speculators were pulled into the Party by these bad elements. They even personally introduced a rich peasant's daughter, who had not been reformed, into the Party, shamelessly saying, "You dare not be her Party introduction, but I will."

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." Liu Shaoqi vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, preparing to usurp the Party. He intended to change our proletarian Party into a fascist party of the bourgeoisie. If the Party is revised, the country will change. Liu Shaoqi's goal of usurping the Party is to restore capitalism in China. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow their plots to succeed.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly carry out the great combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum, following Chairman Mao's instructions that "the Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies, and should be a vigorous vanguard organization." We also follow Chairman Mao's instructions on "renewal" to do a good job in party rectification and building.

	Eliminate the Poison Spread by Liu Shaoqi of "Using Economic Measures to Handle Economic Matters" and Forever Follow the Path of Emphasizing Proletarian Politics
	Liu Shengtian, an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in Liaoning Province and Deputy Director of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Director of the Panjin Reclamation Area Revolutionary Committee:
	Hearing the news that the Eighth Plenum has expelled the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoked all his positions within and outside the Party, the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in our reclamation area are overjoyed, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Many old poor peasants say, "This has finally avenged our deep grudge!"

	Our reclamation area has suffered greatly from the harm done by Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy. In 1963, he and his henchman Tan Zhenlin, in order to realize their wolfish ambition of restoring capitalism, made our reclamation area a "test field" for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the national agricultural reclamation system. Based on the black experiences of Tan Zhenlin here, Liu Shaoqi issued five black directives, advocating the use of "economic measures to handle economic matters" and promoting "material incentives." Agricultural reclamation systems across the country flocked to Panjin to learn from their "experiences," causing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods to spread throughout the country.

	A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Panjin reclamation area, following Liu Shaoqi's black instructions, completely adopted the methods of capitalists to treat workers, destroying the socialist economy. Take the Ping'an Farm as an example. Although the land is fertile and the water conditions are good, due to the harm caused by Liu Shaoqi, the lowest rice yield in local history once occurred.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Following this great teaching of Chairman Mao, we have deeply exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "using economic measures to handle economic matters" created by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Under the guidance of the Plenum's public report, we have discussed and passed a plan to establish the farm based on the principle of "political leadership." We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from Dazhai, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and turn the Panjin reclamation area into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Smash Liu Shaoqi's Tricks to Restore Capitalism
	Zhang Xiang and Ma Cheng, members of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee:
	The Eighth Plenum has pronounced the complete downfall of Liu Shaoqi, removing a great harm for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We fully support this and are determined to thoroughly settle accounts with his counter-revolutionary heinous crimes with the spirit of beating a fallen enemy.

	As soon as the Northeast was liberated, the traitor Liu Shaoqi rushed here to spread poison, madly shouting: "In a few years, the households with three horses, one plow, and one cart should account for eighty percent," truly a dog's mouth cannot spit out jade.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand that in the countryside, households with three horses, one plow, and one cart are not our poor brothers, but landlords and rich peasants. The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi advocates the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" households, intending to develop rich peasant economics in the countryside, allowing capitalism to occupy the countryside, and pushing us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the evil old society, suffering twice and enduring double hardships. This is purely in collusion with the landlords and rich peasants, walking the same black path.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Only socialism can save China." "Without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and consolidated socialism." Chairman Mao's teachings express our wishes and demands as poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods to the point of stench, like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat it. We also remain highly vigilant against the destructive activities of the exploiting class and their agents, ready at any time to repel the black winds and evil waves stirred up by Liu Shaoqi's disciples and followers, and steadfastly walk the socialist road.

	Thoroughly Settle Accounts with Liu Shaoqi's Counter-Revolutionary Crimes
	Liu Yurui, a member of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee and leader of the Xiaoguang Brigade of Xiaoguang Commune in Jin County:
	The Eighth Plenum has expelled Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, from the Party forever and revoked all his positions within and outside the Party. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoguang Brigade, are extremely elated and firmly support this.

	We will never forget the brilliant commentary written by our great leader Chairman Mao for the Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative: "The cooperative led by Liu Yurui is similar to the cooperative of Wang Guanzhan in Hebei Province. Both are poor and looked down upon by others, but through hard struggle, they finally overcame difficulties. There are many such examples in every province, which should be widely publicized to encourage everyone."

	Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Northeast feared and hated our firm adherence to Mao Zedong Thought in running the cooperative, using various poisonous tricks to strike at us poor and lower-middle peasants, which was extremely vicious.

	During the socialist education movement, Liu Shaoqi concocted a set of "ten items" to protect capitalist forces in the countryside, directing the struggle against us poor and lower-middle peasants. Liu Shaoqi's agents in the Northeast, following his devilish ways, came to our brigade to conduct a "socialist education pilot." As soon as they arrived, they sat down in the home of a rich peasant who had always ridiculed us poor and lower-middle peasants, plotting to strike at us. They cursed our brigade cadres of poor and lower-middle peasant origin as "rotten wood that cannot be carved into a peg," and forced us to "yield" to the rich peasant, appointing a middle peasant with serious capitalist thoughts and behaviors as the brigade leader. Soon, all the poor and lower-middle peasant cadres of our brigade were demoted, and then I was labeled as "unreliable" and removed.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought have sharp eyes. They said, striking at the poor and lower-middle peasants is striking at the revolution. We all took action, vowing to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, and fought tenaciously against Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Soon, all Party members re-elected me as the brigade Party branch secretary. We poor and lower-middle peasants stood up again, firmly holding the reins, following Chairman Mao's teachings, and steadfastly walking the bright socialist road.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly respond to the call of the Eighth Plenum to thoroughly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the country, to thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, making him never be able to rise again.

　　彻底清算刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行
　　——参加辽宁省贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会的部分代表在批判会上的发言摘要
    新华社沈阳十二日电　参加辽宁省贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会的代表们，坚决拥护党的八届扩大的十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的决议，并响应全会的战斗号召，深入地批判了刘少奇及其在东北地区代理人的反革命罪行。下边是一部分代表在一次批判会上的发言摘要。
    把刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线砸个稀巴烂！
    辽宁省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、金县革委会副主任徐春玲：
    党的十二中全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。我们贫下中农听到这个喜讯，心里乐开了花。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成”。可是刘少奇这个大叛徒出于他反动的阶级本性，多年前就在东北地区公然叫嚣：“在东北有一万名富农党员也不怕”。以后，他在东北地区的代理人，按照他的意旨，跑到金县“蹲点”，把有个大队的十六名党员清洗了七名，其中多数是老贫农、老积极分子。而有的贪污分子、投机倒把分子却被这些坏蛋拉入党内。他们还亲自给一个没有改造好的富农女儿当入党介绍人，竟恬不知耻地说：“你们不敢当她的入党介绍人，我当。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”刘少奇大肆推行反革命修正主义建党路线，就是为他篡党作准备，他妄想把我们无产阶级的政党篡改为资产阶级的法西斯党。党修国就变。刘少奇篡党的目的，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。我们贫下中农决不允许他们的阴谋得逞。
    我们贫下中农坚决执行党的十二中全会提出的伟大战斗任务，遵照毛主席关于“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的指示，遵照毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的指示，认真做好整党建党工作。
    肃清刘少奇散布的“用经济办法去抓经济”的毒素，永远走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    辽宁省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、辽宁省革委会副主任兼盘锦垦区革委会主任刘盛田：
    听到党的十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的喜讯，我们盘锦垦区广大农工和贫下中农高兴得一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多老贫农说：“这下可解了我们的心头大恨！”
    我们垦区受刘少奇这个大坏蛋的坑害极深。他和他的黑干将谭震林为了实现其复辟资本主义的狼子野心，一九六三年就把盘锦垦区作为他们在全国农垦系统推行反革命修正主义路线的一块“试验田”。刘少奇根据谭震林在这里搞出的黑经验，抛出了五条黑批示，鼓吹以“经济办法去抓经济”，大搞“物质刺激”。全国农垦系统纷纷到盘锦来取“经”，以致刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货流毒全国。
    盘锦垦区党内一小撮走资派按照刘少奇的黑旨意，完全采用资本家的一套办法对待工人，破坏社会主义经济。就拿平安农场来说，这里土地肥沃，水利条件也好，就因为受了刘少奇的毒害，曾出现过当地历史上最低的水稻产量。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，我们对刘少奇及其代理人炮制的“用经济办法去抓经济”等反革命修正主义黑货，进行了深刻的揭发和批判。我们在全会公报的指引下，一鼓作气，讨论通过了按“政治建场”原则拟定的办场方案。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向大寨学习，向解放军学习，把盘锦垦区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    粉碎刘少奇复辟资本主义的鬼花招
    辽宁省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、辽宁省革委会常委张祥、委员马成：
    党的十二中全会宣判了刘少奇的彻底垮台，为我们贫下中农除了一大害。我们一千个赞成，一万个拥护，并决心以痛打落水狗的精神，彻底清算他的反革命滔天罪行。
    东北刚一解放，大叛徒刘少奇就急急忙忙跑来大放其毒，疯狂地叫嚷：“三马一犁一车的农户，在数年后应发展到百分之八十”，真是狗嘴里吐不出象牙来。
    我们贫下中农深深地懂得，在农村拥有三马一犁一车的农户决不是我们穷哥们，而是地主、富农。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹发展“三马一犁一车”的农户，就是要在农村发展富农经济，让资本主义占领农村阵地，把我们贫下中农重新推进万恶的旧社会，受二遍苦、遭二茬罪，这纯粹是和地主、富农安的一个心眼，走的一条黑道。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”毛主席的教导，说出了我们贫下中农的愿望和要求。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义黑货批得臭不可闻，象过街老鼠，人人喊打。我们还对剥削阶级及其代理人的破坏活动保持着高度的警惕，随时准备打退刘少奇的徒子徒孙刮起的黑风，掀起的恶浪，坚定不移地走社会主义阳关大道。
    彻底清算刘少奇的反革命罪行
    辽宁省革委会常委、锦县晓光公社晓光大队领导班子负责人刘玉如：
    党的十二中全会把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，我们晓光大队贫下中农无比振奋，坚决拥护。
    我们永远不能忘记伟大领袖毛主席给晓光农业生产合作社写的那篇金光闪闪的按语：“刘玉如领导的这个合作社，同河北省的王国藩合作社相似，都是因为穷，被人看不起，经过刻苦奋斗，终于战胜了困难的。各省都有许多这样的例子，应当广为传播，鼓励大家。”
    刘少奇和他在东北地区的代理人对我们坚决按照毛泽东思想办社，怕得要死，恨得要命，施出种种毒招，打击我们贫下中农，真是恶毒透顶。
    社会主义教育运动中，刘少奇炮制出一个“后十条”，千方百计地包庇农村资本主义势力，把斗争矛头指向我们贫下中农。刘少奇在东北地区的代理人，本着刘少奇的鬼道，到我们大队搞“社教试点”。他们一来，一屁股就坐在一贯讥笑我们贫下中农的一个漏划富农那里，心里想着打击我们贫下中农的鬼主意。他们骂我们贫下中农出身的大队干部是“朽木砍不出好楔子”，还叫我们贫下中农向漏划富农“让贤”，硬把一个有严重资本主义思想行为的中农安排作大队长。不久，晓光大队的贫下中农骨干，就被统统罢了官，然后给我下了一个“靠不住”的结论，把我也撤下来。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农眼睛是雪亮的。他们说，打击贫下中农，就是打击革命。我们大伙坚决行动起来，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同刘少奇和他的代理人进行了顽强的斗争。不久，全体党员又把我选作大队党支部书记，我们贫下中农又站起来了，紧紧掌握着印把子，按照毛主席的教导，坚定地走社会主义光明大道。
    我们贫下中农坚决响应党的十二中全会的战斗号召，彻底清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行，把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼批倒批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。
