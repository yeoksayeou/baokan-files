Upon arriving at the vast Gannan grasslands, impoverished herdsmen told us, “He Jianfu is a good ‘gakhang’ (teacher) sent by Chairman Mao.”

He Jianfu, the son of a poor peasant, is a teacher at Ma'ai Primary School in Keza Commune, Luqu County, Gansu. For five years, he has followed Chairman Mao’s great teachings and resolutely taken the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Wherever the herdsmen graze, he follows to teach, to propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to receive re-education from the impoverished herdsmen.

Self-Consciously Receiving Re-Education from the Impoverished Herdsmen

In the autumn of 1959, He Jianfu graduated from a normal school. He left the city and came to the Gannan grasslands to teach.

Keza Commune is a purely pastoral area, a relatively harsh place. At that time, Ma'ai Primary School had forty-one Tibetan students and one Tibetan teacher. Apart from a yak-hair tent, the school had nothing. In the autumn, with frequent rains, the tent was often soaked. In winter, with strong winds and heavy snow, the tent was often collapsed by the snow, and the temperature dropped to minus thirty degrees, making it impossible to sleep. Difficulties stood in front of He Jianfu like a roadblock. Should he overcome the difficulties and take root among the impoverished herdsmen, or should he yield to the difficulties and become a shameful deserter? He Jianfu’s soul was in fierce struggle.

The impoverished herdsmen warmly cared for He Jianfu, studied Chairman Mao’s works with him, discussed the past and future of the grasslands, and together recalled hardships and sweetness. The elders encouraged him, saying, “Ma'ai Primary School is the first school in the history of Keza Commune. The impoverished herdsmen are so eager to learn! You must work with us to build a good school!” These words deeply educated He Jianfu. He thought: My family has been begging for three generations, and no one has gone to school. After liberation, it was Chairman Mao and the Party that sent me to school; today, they have entrusted me with the glorious task of cultivating the next generation. I must strive for Chairman Mao and turn Ma'ai Primary School into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

With a red sun in his heart, no difficulty can stop him. In the spring of 1960, he rode a horse more than 170 li to Gaohai to buy Chairman Mao’s works. From then on, he insisted on studying, especially focusing on studying “Three Constantly Read Articles,” “On the Chongqing Negotiations,” and “The Direction of the Youth Movement” and other brilliant works with questions in mind. Whenever the snow collapsed the tent and continuous rain soaked his clothes and bedding, he would recite Chairman Mao’s great teachings: “What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We are working and struggling to solve difficulties.” It was Chairman Mao’s teachings that filled him with revolutionary optimism, encouraging him to overcome difficulties, set up the tent again, and continue working and studying. He used “Three Constantly Read Articles” to measure all his actions. On windy and snowy days, the wind mixed with snowflakes blew into the tent through the cracks, and he used his body to block the wind, letting the students suffer less from the cold. During his spare time, he visited the poor, sought opinions on running the school, and participated in collective production labor.

Wholeheartedly Serving the Impoverished Herdsmen

Chairman Mao taught us: “Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people.” After studying this passage, He Jianfu wrote the following oath: “The duty of a teacher is to cultivate successors of the communist cause with Mao Zedong Thought. For a revolutionary, serving the people cannot be limited to what one should do, and one should take the initiative to do whatever is beneficial to the Party and the people.” He said this and did it.

Huagang Commune has more than thirty students, and they have to walk more than twenty li to and from school every day. In the summer, when the Tong River floods rise, parents are not at ease and sometimes do not let the students go to school. After studying Chairman Mao’s brilliant work “Care for the People’s Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods,” he decided to take on the arduous task of sending students home. He walks more than twenty li to and from school every day to send students, from 1964 to the present, regardless of wind, snow, ice, sun, and rain, without interruption. When encountering bad weather such as heavy rain, heavy snow, or icy roads, he always sends the students to the vicinity of the tent before returning. On the way, he puts his raincoat and sheepskin coat on the students, willingly enduring the rain and cold himself. Some students cannot walk, and he carries them back. The students saw that the teacher was really tired and asked him not to send them anymore, but he insisted on sending them. Every day when he returns, the tea is often cold and the food is often cold. Some comrades advised him not to send students every day, but He Jianfu said, “We must be responsible for the students’ safety and cannot be interrupted for a single day.” The commune’s cadres saw that he was very tired and wanted to assign someone to send the students, but he said, “You are very busy with production, and I can run a bit more.”

For the boarding students, He Jianfu also took care of them in every detail. When the students’ clothes were dirty, he helped wash them; when the boarding students ran out of tsampa, he temporarily could not send it, and he gave his tsampa to the students to eat, trying to make the children of impoverished herdsmen study with peace of mind. Daer, a student from an impoverished herdsman family, had only a mother and son. The mother went blind and could not work, making life relatively difficult, and she requested to drop out and return home. He Jianfu sent his clothes and shoes to Daer to wear, bought notebooks and pens for Daer, and helped him persist in studying until he graduated from primary school. Daer’s mother said gratefully, “You are truly a good ‘gakhang’ sent by Chairman Mao.”

Running the School Amidst Class Struggles

Ma'ai Primary School grew and developed in the midst of class struggles. In the autumn of 1959, when He Jianfu first stepped onto the grasslands, some reactionary lamas, with the support of capitalist roaders, spread rumors everywhere saying, “The Han teacher comes to teach with evil intentions,” maliciously inciting ethnic unity and attempting to prevent Tibetan children from receiving Mao Zedong Thought education. These reactionary lamas also set up a tent opposite the Ma'ai Primary School tent, using various despicable means to try to lure the students away and sabotage the school. He Jianfu was filled with rage and, with the support of the impoverished herdsmen, engaged in a head-on struggle. When the reactionary lamas chanted sutras, He Jianfu led the students to sing “The East Is Red” and shout “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Long live the Communist Party of China!” He went among the people, armed them with Mao Zedong Thought, raised their awareness, and exposed the reactionary lamas’ deceitful lies.

The reactionary lamas and capitalist roaders saw that He Jianfu was fighting resolutely and hated him to death, attempting to assassinate him. The broad masses of impoverished herdsmen knew this and were worried about He Jianfu’s safety, doing everything they could to protect him. One night, the class enemy attempted to assassinate He Jianfu, and the impoverished herdsman Namuji risked his life to move him from the school to his own tent in the dead of night.

In 1962, during a period of temporary difficulties in our country’s economic life, the class enemy used “ghosts and gods” to spread rumors and disrupt students’ studies. Some deceived masses, using the excuse of family difficulties, let their children drop out of school. He Jianfu saw these situations and was so anxious that he could not eat or sleep. He went among the people to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and conduct class education. He told the impoverished herdsmen, “Our great savior is Chairman Mao. Following Chairman Mao’s words is victory and will bring light.”

In the past, due to the influence of Liu Shaoqi’s counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, running the school was divorced from proletarian politics, divorced from the herdsmen masses, and divorced from production practice. The impoverished herdsmen said, “Sweet water through alkaline land, even a good child is taught wrong.” He Jianfu and revolutionary teachers and students listened to the opinions of the impoverished herdsmen, insisted on using Chairman Mao’s works and “Quotations from Chairman Mao” as the main courses, invited impoverished herdsmen to the podium, and gave classes on class struggle. The impoverished herdsmen happily said, “Running the school according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, we are at ease.”

　　藏族牧民欢迎的好教师
　　——记甘南草原学习毛主席著作积极分子、玛艾小学教员何建福的模范事迹
    来到辽阔的甘南草原，贫苦牧民对我们说：“何建福是毛主席派来的好‘格干’（老师）。”
    贫农儿子何建福是甘肃碌曲县科才公社玛艾小学教员。五年来，他遵照毛主席的伟大教导，坚定地走和工农相结合的道路。牧民放牧到那里，他就跟到那里办学，跟到那里宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，跟到那里接受贫苦牧民的再教育。
    自觉地接受贫苦牧民的再教育
    一九五九年秋天，何建福初师毕业了。他离开城市，来到甘南草原教学。
    科才公社是纯牧区，是个比较艰苦的地方。玛艾小学当时共有四十一名藏族学生和一名藏族教师，全校除了一顶牛毛帐篷外，什么也没有。秋季雨多，帐篷里常常被雨水浸湿。冬天风急雪大，帐篷常常被雪压塌，气温降到零下三十多度，冻得睡不着觉。困难就象拦路虎，摆在何建福的面前。是战胜困难，在贫苦牧民中扎根；还是向困难低头，当可耻的逃兵？何建福灵魂深处激烈地斗争着。
    贫苦牧民热情地关怀何建福，和他一起学习毛主席著作，谈草原的过去和将来，共同忆苦思甜。老人鼓励他说：“玛艾小学是科才公社有史以来第一所学校，贫苦牧民多么渴望学习啊！你要和我们一起把学校办好啊！”这些话，深深地教育了何建福。他想：我家三代都是讨饭的，没有一个上学的。解放后，是毛主席和党把自己送进了学校；今天，又把培养下一代的光荣任务交给自己，我一定要为毛主席争气，把玛艾小学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    心中有个红太阳，天大的困难无阻挡。一九六○年春天，他怀着渴求毛泽东思想的迫切心情，骑马到一百七十多里以外的尕海去买毛主席著作。从那时起，他坚持学习，特别注重带着问题学习“老三篇”、《关于重庆谈判》和《青年运动的方向》等光辉著作。每当大雪压塌了帐篷和大雨连绵浸透了衣服、被褥，他就背诵毛主席的伟大教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”正是毛主席的教导，使他充满革命乐观主义的精神，鼓励他战胜困难，把帐篷再撑起来，继续工作和学习。他用“老三篇”衡量自己的一切行动。在大风大雪的日子里，狂风夹着雪片从帐篷的缝隙直往里钻，他用自己的身体挡住风口，让学生少受点冷。课余时间，他访贫问苦，征求办学意见，参加集体生产劳动。
    全心全意地为贫苦牧民服务
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”何建福学习这段话后，写下了这样的誓言：“教师的职责是用毛泽东思想培养共产主义事业的接班人。对一个革命者来说，为人民服务不能局限在自己该做的事的圈子里，只要对党对人民有利的事都应当抢着做。”他这样说也这样做了。
    花格公社有三十多个学生，每天上学来回要走二十多里路。夏天，洮河洪水上涨，家长们不放心，有时不让学生到校。何建福学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作后，决心担负起送学生回家的艰巨任务。他每天来回走二十多里送学生，从一九六四年到现在，不管风雪冰冻，日晒雨淋，从不间断。碰到大雨大雪或冰雪封路的坏天气，他一直把学生送到帐圈附近才回去。在路上，他把自己的雨衣、毡衣披在学生身上，自己甘愿挨雨淋，受寒冻。有的小学生走不动，他就背着送回去。学生们见老师实在辛苦劳累，请求他不要再送了，但他还是坚持要送。每天回来时，常常是茶冷饭凉。有的同志劝他不一定要每天都送学生，何建福说：“我们要为学生的安全负责，一天也不能间断。”社里的干部见他很辛苦，要派专人送学生，他却说：“你们生产很忙，我多跑点路没什么。”
    对住校的学生，何建福也是无微不至地关心他们。学生的衣服脏了，他帮助洗；住校学生糌粑吃完了，一时送不来，他把自己的糌粑分给学生吃，尽量使贫苦牧民的孩子安心上学。贫苦牧民出身的学生达绕，只有母子两人。母亲眼睛瞎了，不能劳动，生活比较困难，要求退学回家。何建福就把自己的衣服、鞋送给达绕穿，还给达绕买本子和笔，帮助他坚持学习到高小毕业。达绕的母亲感激地说：“你真是毛主席他老人家派来的好‘格干’。”
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中办学
    玛艾小学是在阶级斗争中成长和发展起来的。一九五九年秋天，当何建福刚刚踏进草原时，一些反动喇嘛在走资派的支持下到处造谣说：“汉家老师来教学存心不善”，恶毒挑拨民族团结，妄图阻止藏民子女接受毛泽东思想的教育。这些反动喇嘛还在玛艾小学帐篷对面搭起帐篷，用各种卑劣手段，妄图把学生拉走，搞垮学校。何建福满腔怒火，在贫苦牧民的支持下，进行了针锋相对的斗争。当反动喇嘛念“经”的时候，何建福就带领学生大唱《东方红》，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”他深入群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众，提高群众觉悟，戳穿反动喇嘛骗人的鬼话。
    反动喇嘛和走资派看到何建福斗争坚决，恨得要命，便企图暗杀他。广大贫苦牧民知道后，都为何建福的安全担心，千方百计地保护他。一天晚上，阶级敌人企图暗杀何建福，贫苦牧民那木九冒着生命危险，在深夜里把他从学校转移到自己的帐篷里。
    一九六二年，在我国经济生活遇到暂时困难时期，阶级敌人用“神鬼”制造谣言，破坏学生学习。有些受蒙蔽的群众，借口家里困难，让子女退学。何建福看到这些情况，急得吃不下饭，睡不着觉。他就到群众中去宣传毛泽东思想，进行阶级教育。他对贫苦牧民们说：“我们的大救星是毛主席。听毛主席的话，就是胜利，就能得到光明。”
    过去，由于刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的影响，办学脱离了无产阶级政治，脱离了牧民群众，脱离了生产实践。贫苦牧民说：“甜水过碱滩，好孩子也教坏了。”何建福和革命师生，听取了贫苦牧民的意见，坚持以毛主席著作、《毛主席语录》为主课，请贫苦牧民登上讲台，大讲阶级斗争课。贫苦牧民高兴地说：“按照毛主席的指示办学，我们放心了。”　本报通讯员
