The people of Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan have recently expressed their views, stating that the issuance of the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) marks the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China in the realms of politics, ideology, and organization.

The chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Kuroya Shoichiro, pointed out that the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC has great historical significance. It points out a brilliant future for all peoples of the world.

Kuroya said, the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shattered the illusions of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Miyamoto, the Japanese comprador monopoly capitalists, and the reactionaries of various countries who had hoped to restore capitalism in China. This is the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary peoples of the world and Japan.

Kuroya emphasized that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China proves that the CPC, with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader, is a great, glorious, and correct party. Kuroya excitedly said, the great CPC, after experiencing the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has decided to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time. We heartily cheer for this.

Kuroya emphasized that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China proves that Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has extremely profound and epoch-making significance. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding ideology for the Chinese people but also for the Japanese people and all peoples of the world. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, and strive for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

The secretary of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Women's Democratic Federation, Itakura Sumiko, said that the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC has made us clearly recognize the current characteristics of the world situation, thereby enhancing our fighting spirit.

Itakura warmly applauded the CPC's decision to expel Liu Shaoqi, the agent of imperialism and revisionism and the enemy of the people, from the Party forever. Itakura said, practical struggles have proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot achieve victory in our struggles.

Itakura said, regardless of how the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionists obstruct and sabotage the liberation struggle of the Japanese people, the hearts of the Japanese people will always be with the world's revolutionary bastion—China, with the great leader Chairman Mao. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stride forward on the path of the Japanese people's struggle for liberation.

The "Gear Seat" theater troupe in Japan issued a written statement pointing out that the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC declares the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, expels the most dangerous enemy within the Party, the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, from the Party forever, and thus shatters the evil conspiracy of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to restore capitalism in China. It opens up the broad road for humanity to march towards communism. This is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the international communist movement.

The written statement said, the communiqué is a great call to arms. It greatly encourages the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world and the Japanese people. The statement concludes with a salute: Long live the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!
