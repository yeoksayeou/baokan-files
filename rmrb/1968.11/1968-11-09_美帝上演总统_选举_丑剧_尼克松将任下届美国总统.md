The U.S. empire staged a presidential "election" farce. Nixon will become the next U.S. president.

	According to a report by a U.S. bourgeois news agency on the 6th, the Democratic Party, which has been in power for eight consecutive years, has been ousted, and the Republican Party has taken over, with Nixon set to become the next U.S. president. Nixon was "elected" under the banner of supposedly "reducing our commitments in areas where we have overextended ourselves around the world" and "placing greater emphasis on priority areas" such as Europe. This is a desperate attempt by the U.S. monopoly capitalist group to "change horses" in the face of extreme difficulties and chaos, and it is a prominent manifestation of the deepening crisis and impending doom of U.S. imperialism.

	In recent years, the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries around the world have flourished, dealing heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The U.S.'s policy of aggression and war has met with setbacks everywhere, greatly exacerbating its own political and economic crises and accelerating the disintegration of the entire imperialist system. U.S. imperialism's policy of external aggression and expansion and internal fascist rule is accelerating the awakening of the American people. This year, African Americans launched an unprecedented wave of violent struggles; the struggles of the broad masses of workers and progressive students are surging higher and higher. At the same time, after the largest financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years this year, the position of the dollar has been shaky, inflation has become more serious, and industrial production has become increasingly sluggish. Faced with these difficulties, even the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson had to admit that the U.S. is experiencing a "dangerous and extraordinary period."

	The U.S. empire's predicament of being in a bind both internally and externally, with no way out, has intensified the development of contradictions within the U.S. ruling class. Various U.S. monopoly capitalist groups engaged in backstabbing and deceit during the elections, even resorting to violent means to deal with their opponents. Democratic Senator and former U.S. President John F. Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, was assassinated; within the Democratic Party, the Johnson, Humphrey, and McCarthy factions fought fiercely at the Democratic National Convention, even coming to blows. All of this is a clear sign of the U.S. ruling class being in a state of chaos and turmoil amid the crisis. No wonder Western news agencies reported: "This election is the most chaotic in U.S. history."

	It is precisely under these circumstances, where difficulties cannot be shaken off and the competition is extremely fierce, that the U.S. monopoly capitalist group, helplessly, brought forward another of its tools—the Republican Party—to take the stage, in a vain attempt to continue its desperate struggle.

	The history of the bourgeois dictatorship of U.S. imperialism shows that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are two of a kind. Their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary nature is exactly the same. No matter whom the U.S. monopoly capitalist group sends to the White House, it cannot escape the crisis facing the U.S. empire, nor can it save the U.S. empire from its inevitable doom.

    美帝上演总统“选举”丑剧
    尼克松将任下届美国总统
    新华社八日讯　据美国资产阶级通讯社六日报道的选举结果，连续执政八年的民主党宣告下台，共和党上台执政，尼克松将任下届美国总统。尼克松是在打着所谓“我们必须在世界各地那些我们摊的面过大的地区削减我们承担的义务”以及“把较大的侧重点放在优先的地区”即欧洲等地区的招牌下“当选”的，这是美国垄断资本集团在极端困难和混乱的情况下被迫在急流中“换马”，是美帝国主义危机重重、穷途末路的一个突出表现。
    近年来，世界各国人民的革命运动蓬勃发展，沉重地打击着美帝国主义和它的帮凶苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团；美国的侵略政策和战争政策到处碰壁，极大地加剧了它本身的政治和经济危机，促使整个帝国主义加速分崩离析。美帝国主义对外侵略扩张、对内强化法西斯统治的政策正在加速美国人民群众的觉醒。美国黑人在今年掀起了一场规模空前的暴力斗争浪潮；广大工人和进步学生的斗争也一浪高过一浪。与此同时，经过今年资本主义世界四十年来最大的一次金融危机之后，美元地位一直处在风雨飘摇中，通货膨胀现象越来越严重，工业生产越来越不景气。面临着这种种困难，甚至美帝头子约翰逊也不得不承认，美国正经历着“充满危险的非常时期”。
    美帝国主义的这种内外交困、走投无路的窘境加剧了美国统治集团内部矛盾的发展。美国各垄断资本集团在竞选中勾心斗角、尔虞我诈，甚至不惜使用暴力手段来对付自己的对手。民主党参议员、美国前总统约翰·肯尼迪的弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪遭到暗杀；民主党内约翰逊、汉弗莱派和麦卡锡派在民主党代表大会上吵得不可开交、甚至大打出手。这一切都是美国统治集团在危机中矛盾激化、乱作一团的显著标志。难怪西方通讯社在报道中说：“这次选举是美国有史以来最紊乱的一次选举”。
    正是在这种困难无法摆脱、角逐非常激烈的情况下，美国垄断资本集团，无可奈何地抬出了它的另一个御用工具——共和党上台，妄图继续进行垂死的挣扎。
    美帝国主义的资产阶级专政的历史表明，民主党和共和党都是一丘之貉，它们反共、反人民、反革命的本性是完全一样的。美国垄断资本集团无论把谁送进白宫，都无法摆脱美帝面临的危机，都无法挽救美帝彻底失败的命运。
