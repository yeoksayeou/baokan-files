The splendor of the bulletin illuminates the coal sea. Under the inspiration of the bulletin of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, the revolutionary and production situation at the Daming No. 1 Mine of the Tieling Coal Mining Bureau is excellent.

The bulletin of the 12th Plenary Session, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, was issued. The PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Daming No. 1 Mine of the Tieling Coal Mining Bureau in Liaoning, along with revolutionary workers, immediately launched a campaign to seriously study the bulletin, enthusiastically propagate the bulletin, and resolutely implement the bulletin. They are determined to complete the various combat tasks proposed in the bulletin with their actual actions, thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and achieve victory in both revolution and production!

"Revolutionary committees are good," good because they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, timely study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions. After the bulletin was issued, the revolutionary committee immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the members of the revolutionary committee to seriously study the bulletin and research the implementation of the various combat tasks proposed in the bulletin.

The bulletin of the 12th Plenary Session of the Party is the mobilization order for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The entire mine is filled with the moving scene of seriously studying the bulletin. The PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine and the revolutionary miners study the bulletin seriously during work intervals underground, drawing boundless strength from the bulletin.

The resolution of the 12th Plenary Session of the Party expels the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revokes all his positions within and outside the Party, which is in accordance with the wishes of the revolutionary masses. The PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine and the revolutionary miners, with strong class hatred, fiercely denounce Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes, determined to denounce and expose him thoroughly, making him infamous forever and never allowing him to rise again.

The revolutionary committee and the broad masses of revolutionary miners, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform," are determined to reform all unreasonable regulations and systems. This is the deputy director of the revolutionary committee and military representative Liu Juntian, who went deep into the mine to study the reform of the coal mine system with the workers.

Under the inspiration of the bulletin, the broad masses of revolutionary miners at the Daming No. 1 Mine, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting vigorously in the coal sea. The coal production has achieved a new leap, and the production indicators are constantly being updated.
