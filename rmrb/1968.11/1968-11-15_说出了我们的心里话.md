We heard from the radio about the suggestion from teachers Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu of Maji Primary School in Maji Commune, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province, regarding the management of public primary schools by production brigades, as well as the important editorial note from the People's Daily. Our hearts are filled with excitement, and we shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! We wish Chairman Mao a long life! A life of ten thousand years!

The letter from Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu represents the wishes of us rural primary school teachers and speaks our hearts' desire. Our school is located in Caopu Production Brigade and is originally a part of the brigade. It should be managed by the brigade and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade. However, under the revisionist educational line promoted by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents, rural primary schools were arbitrarily divided into public and private classes, and teachers were divided into public and private teachers. A handful of capitalist roaders even proposed that "those with money can attend public schools, those without money can attend private schools, and those who cannot pay tuition fees should get out." The capitalist roaders within the school politically discriminated against private class teachers, not providing them with Chairman Mao's works or allowing them to read study documents. Even more vilely, schools like ours, located in rural areas, were not allowed to be managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade. When the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade came to the school to discuss issues, the capitalist roaders within the school would refuse the leadership and supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying, "We are public schools, with the education bureau above and the central school below, we don't need you to manage."

All of this, we have seen with our own eyes and remembered in our hearts.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." We are so excited that we couldn't sleep for several nights. Now, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu suggest that all public primary schools should be transferred to the production brigades to be managed, directly by the poor and lower-middle peasants and under the leadership of the brigade. This suggestion is of great importance.

Our great leader Chairman Mao is the closest to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we are the most loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. We will, with practical actions, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on the education revolution. We will honestly accept the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, under the leadership of the brigade party branch, earnestly carry out our own ideological revolutionization. We will wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, resolutely build new-type schools according to the needs of the proletariat, cultivate good successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and turn the brigade's private schools into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　说出了我们的心里话
    我们从广播里听到了山东省嘉祥县马集公社马集小学革命教师侯振民、王庆余同志关于公办小学由大队来办的建议和《人民日报》的重要编者按，心情十分激动，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    侯振民、王庆余同志的信，代表了我们农村小学教师的心愿，说出了我们的心里话。我们小学设在曹堡大队里，本来是大队的一部分，应该由大队来管理，应该为大队里的贫下中农服务；但是，过去在大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人所推行的一套修正主义教育路线下，却把农村小学硬分成什么公办班，民办班，把教师分成公办教师和民办教师，一小撮走资派还提出什么“有钱念公办，没钱念民办，交不起学费就滚蛋。”校内走资派在政治上极力歧视教民办班的教师，不给民办教师发毛主席著作，不让看学习文件。更恶毒的是，象我们这样的小学设在农村，却不让大队的贫下中农过问，大队贫下中农来学校商量问题，校内的走资派便借口“我们是公办的，上有文教局，下有中心校，用不着你们管”来拒绝贫下中农的领导和监督。所有这些，我们都看在眼里，记在心里。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”我们兴奋得一连好几夜睡不着。如今，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，侯振民和王庆余同志建议所有公办小学一律下放到生产大队来办，直接由贫下中农管理，受大队领导，这一建议太重要了。
    伟大领袖毛主席对贫下中农最亲，我们对伟大领袖毛主席最忠。我们要以实际行动，坚决落实毛主席关于教育革命的伟大指示，老老实实接受贫下中农的领导，在大队党支部的领导下，认真搞好自身思想革命化。我们一定要全心全意为贫下中农服务好，坚决按照无产阶级的需要建设新型的学校，培养好无产阶级革命事业的接班人，把大队的民办学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
