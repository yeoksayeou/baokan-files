In India, there are annual famines, and every year tens of thousands of people starve to death.

In the United States, food production is in surplus every year, yet more than a million people are starving.

India is a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism weigh heavily on the Indian people. The broad masses of laborers are subjected to ruthless exploitation, and famine and starvation are inevitable.

The United States is a so-called "advanced" capitalist country, yet millions of people are going hungry. This is also inevitable, a necessary result of the evil rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie.

The great Lenin once said: "The wealth of capitalist society is growing at an incredible rate, while the working masses are becoming increasingly impoverished." The path of capitalist development is a path that leads the broad masses of laborers to starvation. Under the capitalist system, capitalists own the means of production, and their production is aimed at pursuing the maximum profit, which cannot possibly be used to meet the needs of the laboring people. They would rather let the grain rot in the warehouses than let the laboring people eat their fill. Capitalists, in order to ensure the acquisition of cheap labor, and to use the "whip of hunger" to drive the laboring people to create more surplus value, always keep the broad masses in a state of unemployment and hunger. Therefore, the more capitalist production develops, the more acute the polarization of society becomes, with enormous wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few exploiters, while the laboring people who create this wealth become increasingly impoverished. This is an absolute law of capitalism. In the United States, where a handful of billionaires rule and which is called the most "prosperous" country, millions of laboring people are struggling on the brink of starvation, leading extremely miserable and impoverished lives. This is determined by this law of capitalism.

The bourgeoisie wields the "whip of hunger," inflicting deep suffering on the laboring people, and at the same time, it awakens them to rise up and resist and struggle. Today, the ranks of the gravediggers that the American monopoly bourgeoisie has prepared for itself are expanding, and their doom is approaching ever closer.

### 美国人民为什么挨饿？

    美国人民为什么挨饿？
    在印度，年年闹粮荒，每年有成千成万的人饿死。
    在美国，粮食生产年年“过剩”，也有一千多万人在挨饿。
    印度是一个半封建、半殖民地国家，帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山压在印度人民头上，广大劳动人民受着残酷的剥削，闹饥荒，饿死人，这是必然的。
    美国是一个所谓“先进”的资本主义国家，却也是千百万人饿肚皮。这也是必然的，是美国垄断资产阶级罪恶统治的必然结果。
    伟大的列宁说过：“资本主义社会的财富以难于置信的速度增长着，而工人群众却日益贫困。”资本主义的发展道路，就是使广大劳动人民挨饿的道路。在资本主义制度下，资本家占有生产资料，他们的生产是为了追求最大限度的利润，决不可能用来满足劳动人民的需要。他们宁愿把粮食堆在仓库里发霉，也不肯让劳动人民吃饱。资本家为了保证获得廉价的劳动力，为了用“饥饿的鞭子”驱使劳动人民创造更多的剩余价值，总是使广大群众处于失业和饥饿状态。因此，资本主义的生产越发展，社会的两极分化就越尖锐，巨大的财富越来越集中在少数剥削者手中，而创造这些财富的劳动人民则日益贫困化，这是资本主义的绝对规律。在一小撮亿万富翁统治的、号称最“富足”的美国，千百万劳苦大众挣扎在饥饿线上，过着极悲惨的贫困生活，正是这个资本主义的规律所决定的。
    资产阶级挥舞着“饥饿的鞭子”，给劳动人民造成深重的苦难，同时也就促使他们日益觉醒，起来反抗和斗争。今天，美国垄断资产阶级给自己准备的掘墓人的队伍正在越来越扩大，他们的末日也就越来越临近了。
