South Yemen Protests British Aircraft Violation of Airspace

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Aden, the South Yemeni government on October 26 handed a note to the British government strongly protesting the provocative actions of two British military aircraft that violated the airspace of the People's Republic of South Yemen.

This note was handed over by the acting secretary-general of the South Yemeni Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rashad Shabib, to the acting charge d'affaires of the British Embassy in South Yemen. The note stated that two British military aircraft flew over the towns of Hawf and Qadi'b in the sixth province of eastern South Yemen on October 20 and 22.

The note said that the British government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of its provocation against an independent sovereign state. The South Yemeni Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already submitted two notes of protest to the British government in March and May of this year regarding similar incidents.

    南也门抗议英国飞机侵犯领空
    据新华社亚丁电　南也门政府十月二十六日交给英国政府一份照会，强烈抗议两架英国军用飞机侵犯南也门人民共和国领空的挑衅行径。
    这份照会是由南也门外交部代理常务秘书拉沙德·沙比交给英国驻南也门大使馆临时代办的。照会说，两架英国军用飞机在十月二十日和二十二日飞越南也门东部第六省的豪夫镇和加迪卜镇。
    照会说，英国政府必须对它对一个独立的主权国家的挑衅所产生的全部后果承担责任。南也门外交部已经在今年三月和五月就类似事件向英国政府提出过两次抗议照会。
