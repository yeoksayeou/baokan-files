Our medical team was established in 1965. Over the past three years, we have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's series of instructions on medical work, using the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles. Despite being stationed in dispersed locations with harsh environments and limited equipment, we have focused on serving the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the units and the workers and peasants in the local area, achieving certain successes.

In the process of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we have deeply felt that due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, there were many rules and regulations in our medical team that did not meet the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, seriously hindering us from better serving them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we have started from the actual situation of the army, relied on the masses, and carried out extensive reforms in the work of the medical team. Our principle is: whatever the workers, peasants, and soldiers do not need, we break; whatever they need, we establish.

A small medical team establishes a surgical room

Construction units often encounter external injuries, but according to past regulations, the medical team only handled transfers, not treatments. This not only increased the pain of the injured but also resulted in some avoidable disabilities and deaths. In 1965, when we first established the team, a soldier from a sister unit suffered a severe external injury that required immediate rescue. However, due to the lack of surgical equipment at the time, we missed the opportunity to save him. Another soldier had a work-related fracture, and because we lacked surgical equipment, he had to be transferred to another hospital. During the transfer, the injury caused the soldier great pain. Seeing these incidents, we were deeply moved. We believed that the regulation of the medical team "only handling transfers, not treatments" was an unreasonable rule that did not care about the soldiers' suffering and should be firmly broken.

When we proposed establishing a surgical room, we encountered opposition from some individuals who said, "Since there are regulations from higher authorities, handling transfers is enough. Why bother?" The comrades in our medical team said: To reduce the suffering of our class brothers, we will take on this trouble. Thus, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we strive for victory," we took the initiative to build the surgical room ourselves. We lacked a surgical table, so we used two tables placed together; we lacked anesthetic drugs, so we made them ourselves; we lacked surgical instruments, so we made them ourselves, and for those we couldn't make, we sought help from relevant units. There were few people in the team who could perform surgeries, so we trained ourselves, learning from experienced comrades and practicing while working. In this way, relying on our red hearts dedicated to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we overcame various difficulties and finally established the surgical room.

Our surgical room, despite its poor conditions and simple equipment, solved many problems for the unit. Now, most surgical treatments for work-related injuries are done without transferring to other hospitals, greatly reducing the pain of our class brothers and ensuring timely treatment for those who need surgery. A soldier from the Fourth Company, Xiao Jingwu, had his right calf tendon blown off. If he had been transferred for surgery, the delay in treatment might have caused tissue necrosis and disability. With the surgical room, we completed the surgery in less than half an hour, and he recovered and returned to duty in twenty days. Currently, we not only solve the problem of rescuing common external injuries but also some comrades can perform surgeries like appendectomy, hernia repair, and varicose vein ligation. Over the past two years, our modest surgical room has performed hundreds of minor and major surgeries for injured and sick soldiers who would have otherwise needed to be transferred, with no complications, earning praise from the unit's cadres and soldiers.

The establishment of the surgical room was a revolution in our small medical team. Now, we can better serve the soldiers and the local workers and peasants, and our hearts are closer to the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Mobilizing the masses to overcome pneumoconiosis

In construction units, preventing pneumoconiosis is a major issue for ensuring the soldiers' health. However, due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by Liu Shaoqi, some people have neglected this matter, saying it is the responsibility of the labor department, not the medical department. Should we manage it or not? We believe: As long as it benefits the workers, peasants, and soldiers and meets their needs, we must manage it. We cannot stand by and watch pneumoconiosis harm the lives of our class brothers. We are determined to mobilize the masses to fight against pneumoconiosis.

To do a good job in preventing pneumoconiosis, we conducted multiple investigations and studies, proposing methods such as watering the eyes, using wet slag, and reducing dust concentration. When this proposal was initially implemented, many companies did not follow through. We then went deep into the companies, working and listening to the soldiers' feedback. We found that some soldiers were concerned about affecting the project's progress and were reluctant to water the eyes. Facing this situation, we selected Chairman Mao's relevant quotations, printed dust prevention knowledge materials, wrote quick-talk poems, drew lantern slides, and organized propaganda teams to go deep into the construction sites, actively carrying out propaganda activities, emphasizing the importance of preventing pneumoconiosis and related knowledge. To reduce the fatigue of carrying water up the mountain, we also worked with relevant departments to research and create equipment that uses compressed air to replace high-pressure water tanks. Through these efforts, all construction points in the unit implemented the method of watering the eyes, reducing the dust concentration in the tunnel air from the national standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.2 to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter.

With the reduction in dust concentration, should we be satisfied with the status quo, or should we continue to advance? Following Chairman Mao's teaching that serving the people should be "complete" and "thorough," we further studied methods to prevent dust from entering the respiratory tract, aiming to completely eliminate pneumoconiosis. Preventing dust from entering the respiratory tract is key to wearing suitable masks. Initially, we bought a type of dust mask, but the soldiers did not want to wear it. Why? We wore the mask and worked with the soldiers, personally experiencing that this mask was hard and had few holes, making it difficult to breathe while working. Later, we bought two more types of masks, but they were also unsuitable. However, we did not give up. Following Chairman Mao's teaching, we decided to create the most suitable mask ourselves. Thus, we worked and studied with the soldiers, conducting more than ten experiments, finally making a suitable protective mask. To ensure that all soldiers in the unit could quickly wear this mask, we mobilized all team members and convalescents to take on the task of making the masks, ensuring a timely supply. Over the past three years, we have made more than 12,000 dust masks for the unit. After multiple strict inspections, no cases of pneumoconiosis were found in the unit. This serious enemy threatening the soldiers' health was finally defeated by us.

Cultivating "local" doctors in practice

In our work practice, we deeply felt that the past regulation that medical assistants could not become doctors without medical school training was wrong and must be broken. Our unit's troops are scattered, and doctors are needed everywhere. What should we do? Should we rely on medical schools for training, or should we cultivate doctors through practice? Our branch believes: Medical schools are one way to cultivate doctors, but they are not the main way. The main way is to cultivate "local" doctors through work practice. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's business. Often, it is not about learning first and then doing, but about doing and then learning. Doing is learning." In the past, the revisionist line pushed by Liu Shaoqi emphasized "standardization," "systematic training," and "graduates from regular schools," limiting the cultivation of doctors through practice and opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As a result, the main channel for cultivating doctors was blocked, leading to a strange phenomenon: On one hand, there was a shortage of doctors, and on the other hand, many politically and ideologically sound medical assistants with practical experience could not be cultivated and promoted, failing to play a greater role. To better implement Chairman Mao's instructions and ensure the unit's current health and combat readiness, we opened our own training classes, cultivating many doctors from medical assistants with practical experience.

In the training classes, we followed the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on class education and the two-line struggle, emphasizing the establishment of the thought of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We followed Chairman Mao's teaching of combining theory with practice, adopting methods of training based on actual needs, using work to train, and learning while working. Since construction units have many external injuries, we first learned techniques such as hemostasis, bandaging, and fixation; in summer, we first learned to prevent and treat intestinal infectious diseases, and in winter, we learned to treat respiratory infections. At the same time, we adopted the method of learning while treating, conducting learning in the treatment process. In surgical operations, we were both bold and strict in following scientific principles. In the training, we inherited the glorious tradition of our army, "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers." Regardless of whether they were doctors or medical assistants, whoever was good at something taught it, mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm for mutual teaching and learning. Through on-the-job training, 31 comrades in our unit's medical assistants can now perform common minor and medium surgeries under the guidance of doctors, 17 medical assistants can use 70 to over 100 types of drugs, and 8 medical assistants have already taken on the work of doctors (assistants). Now, our unit basically ensures that common minor surgeries do not leave the camp, and common medium surgeries do not leave the unit. Last year, the political instructor of the Third Company, Liu Shizhong, suffered from acute appendicitis, and medical assistant Xu Jinyuan performed the surgery, resulting in primary healing, and he was discharged after seven days. Liu Shizhong praised, "These 'local' doctors are amazing!"

Establishing a revolutionary medical and nursing cooperation system

In the process of breaking for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and establishing for them, we also broke down the bourgeois medical and nursing boundaries and established a revolutionary medical and nursing cooperation system. In the past, medical and nursing personnel had clear divisions, creating an artificial line between doctors and medical assistants, increasing the distance between mental and physical labor, and destroying the glorious tradition of our army's officers and soldiers being one. In the early days of establishing the team, due to the clear division of medical and nursing work, some abnormal phenomena appeared: Doctors only treated patients, wrote prescriptions, and gave medical orders; medical assistants only took care of patients, maintained cleanliness and hygiene, and followed medical orders. Some medical assistants said, "The doctor's mouth, the medical assistant's legs." The relationship between doctors and medical assistants was not close enough and not well-coordinated. Our branch believed: The clearer the bourgeois medical and nursing boundaries, the farther the distance between comrades, which is not conducive to the thought revolutionization of doctors, the revolutionization of work style, and greatly hinders the development of our army's glorious tradition of officers and soldiers being one. Especially in situations with few personnel and heavy workloads, it also affected the development of work.

How to change this situation? The branch mobilized everyone to discuss. In the discussion, everyone believed: We must break down this bourgeois medical and nursing boundary and establish a new system of revolutionary medical and nursing cooperation. Only in this way can we promote the thought revolutionization and work style revolutionization of people and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Thus, we took "breaking down the bourgeois medical and nursing boundary" as the topic and carried out a revolutionary criticism and repudiation throughout the team, severely criticizing the revisionist medical and health line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi. On the basis of raising awareness and unifying understanding, we also gradually explored some methods: First, doctors participate in nursing work, and medical assistants learn to participate in treatment work; second, doctors and medical assistants from the unit's medical team and camp and company doctors and medical assistants rotate according to the situation; third, cadres, doctors, and medical assistants seriously implement the "five together" (study together, criticize and repudiate together, eat together, live together, and work together), especially emphasizing that leading cadres and doctors participate in physical labor training. Over the past three years, we have personally carried various drugs and equipment; the bedding and surgical dressings of injured and sick soldiers are washed by ourselves; the team leader builds pigpens, doctors plant vegetables, cook, and clean sputum cups; even the cotton swabs used for applying medicine are made by everyone.

The establishment of the medical and nursing cooperation system greatly promoted the thought revolutionization and work style revolutionization of our medical team, further strengthened the officer-soldier relationship, and carried forward the glorious tradition of our army's officers and soldiers being one. Doctors said, "Medical and nursing cooperation makes us doctors get rid of our airs, strengthen our labor viewpoint, avoid alienation from the masses, and is very beneficial for our thought reform." Medical assistants said, "Doctors work with us and labor together, making them more approachable."

We feel: The process of breaking down bourgeois and revisionist rules and regulations is the process of raising our awareness of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The more we break, the closer we get to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only by thoroughly eliminating the influence and poison of the revisionist line can we better follow Chairman Mao's instructions and advance on the path of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    工农兵不需要的就破　工农兵需要的就立
    北京部队　某团卫生队党支部
    我们卫生队是一九六五年建立的。三年来，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于卫生工作的一系列指示，以“老三篇”为座右铭，在驻地分散、环境艰苦、设备简陋的情况下，面向连队，深入基层，努力为部队广大干部战士服务，为驻地的工农群众服务，取得了一定的成绩。
    在为工农兵服务的过程中，我们深深感到：在医疗卫生战线上，由于大叛徒刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义路线的影响，在我们这个团卫生队里，过去也有不少不符合工农兵需要的条条、框框，严重地阻碍着我们更好地为工农兵服务。毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”按照毛主席的指示，我们从部队的实际出发，依靠广大群众，大破大立，对卫生队的工作进行了不少改革。我们的原则是：凡是工农兵不需要的就破，凡是工农兵需要的就立。
    小卫生队建立了外科手术室
    施工部队容易出外伤，可是，按照过去的规定，对于外伤，团卫生队只管转送，不管治疗。这样，不但给伤员增加了痛苦，还造成了一些可以避免的残废和死亡现象。一九六五年，我们初建队时，兄弟部队的一位战士发生严重外伤，急需抢救，但是由于当时我们没有外科手术设备，结果失去了抢救机会。还有一个战士工伤骨折，也是因为我们没有外科手术设备，只好转院。在转送途中，给伤员带来很大痛苦。对这些事，我们看在眼里，痛在心上。我们认为，团卫生队“只管转院，不管治疗”的规定，是一种不关心战士疾苦的不合理的规章制度，应当坚决打破。
    当我们提出建立外科手术室的建议时，遇到个别人的反对，说：“既然上级有规定，管好转院就行了，何必自找麻烦呢？”我们卫生队的同志说：为了减轻阶级兄弟的痛苦，我们就是要找这个麻烦。于是，我们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，自己动手筹建外科手术室。没有手术台，我们就用两张桌子对起来；没有麻醉药品，我们就自己配制；没有手术器械，我们就自己制造，一时不能自己制造的，就向有关单位求援。队里能做外科手术的人不多，我们就自己设法培训，在工作实践中以老带新，干中学，学中干。就是这样，我们靠着全心全意为工农兵服务的红心，克服了种种困难，终于建立起了外科手术室。
    我们这个手术室，尽管条件差、设备简陋，却给部队解决了很大问题。现在，因工负伤的手术，我们很少转院治疗，这就大大减轻了阶级兄弟的痛苦，使需要动手术的同志能够得到及时的治疗。四连战士肖靖武的小腿右后方跟腱被炸断，如果转院进行手术，可能因为抢救不及时，引起组织坏死，造成残废。有了外科手术室，我们用了不到半小时，做完了手术，二十天后就痊愈归队。目前，我们不仅解决了一般常见外伤的抢救问题，而且部分同志能作阑尾、疝气、大隐静脉曲张切除等外科手术。两年多来，我们这个简陋的外科手术室，为四百多个过去需要转院治疗的伤病员进行了中、小手术，没有一例发生问题，受到部队干部战士的好评。
    外科手术室的建立，在我们这个小小的卫生队，也是一次革命。现在，我们能够更好地为战士、为驻地工农群众服务，我们的心和工农兵贴得更紧了。
    发动群众战胜矽肺病
    在施工部队，预防矽肺病是保证战士身体健康的大问题。可是，长期以来，由于刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义路线的影响，有个别人，却把这样一件和干部战士生命攸关的大事，推出不管，说什么：这是劳动部门的事，不是卫生部门的事。一不给钱，二不过问。管还是不管？我们认为：只要是对工农兵有利，为工农兵需要的事，我们都要管。我们决不能眼看着矽肺病危害阶级兄弟的生命而不管不问。我们决心发动广大群众，向矽肺病开战。
    为了做好预防矽肺病工作，我们进行了多次调查研究，提出打水眼，装湿渣，降低粉尘浓度的建议。这一建议开始实行时，许多连队没有落实。我们就深入连队，边劳动，边了解战士反映。发现有些战士担心影响工程进度，不愿打水眼。针对这种情况，我们就选择毛主席有关语录，编印防尘知识材料，写快板、画幻灯，组织宣传队深入施工现场，积极开展宣传活动，大讲预防矽肺病的重大意义和有关常识。为了减轻往山上抬水的疲劳，我们还和有关部门一起，研究创制了空压机顶水代替高压水箱的设备。经过一系列努力，全团各个作业点普遍实行了打水眼的方法，使坑道内空气的粉尘浓度，由国家规定的每立方米二毫克，降低到每立方米一点二至一点五毫克。
    粉尘浓度降低了，是满足现状，还是继续前进呢？我们遵照毛主席为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”的教导，进一步研究防止粉尘进入呼吸道的办法，以彻底消灭矽肺病。防止粉尘进入呼吸道，关键问题是戴适用的口罩。开始，我们买了一种防尘口罩，发到连队后，战士们都不愿戴。为什么呢？我们就戴着口罩和战士一起劳动，亲身体验，发现这种口罩壳硬，孔少，戴着它劳动呼吸困难。后来，又买了两种口罩，也不适用。但是我们没有灰心，我们遵照毛主席的教导，下决心自己创制最适用的口罩。于是，我们就和战士一起劳动，一起研究，经过十多次试验，终于制作了一种适用的防护口罩。为了让全团战士很快戴上这种口罩，我们就发动全队同志和休养人员，主动地承担了制作任务，及时保证了口罩的供应。三年来，我们为部队制作防尘口罩一万二千多个。经过多次严格检查，全团没有发现一名矽肺病患者。矽肺病这个严重威胁战士健康的敌人，终于被我们战胜了。
    在实践中培养“土”医生
    我们在工作实践中深深感到：过去所谓卫生员不经医校培养不能当医生的规定，本身就是错误的，非把它破掉不可。我们团的部队驻地很分散，到处都需要医生。怎么办？是靠医校培养？还是靠从实践中锻炼培养医生？我们支部认为：医校是培养医生的一个途径，但它不是主要的途径。主要的途径是靠在工作实践中培养“土”医生。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”过去，刘少奇推行的修正主义路线，强调什么“正规化”、“系统化”、“科班出身”，限制从实践中培养医生，和毛主席的革命路线相对抗。结果，培养医生的主要渠道被堵塞了，因而出现了一种奇怪现象：一方面缺少医生，另一方面又使大量的政治思想好、又有实践经验的卫生员，不能得到培养、提高，发挥更大的作用。为了更好地贯彻毛主席的指示，保障部队当前健康和战备的需要，我们自己开办了训练班，从有实践经验的卫生员中培养了不少医生。
    在训练班里，我们以毛泽东思想为指针，狠抓阶级教育和两条路线教育，强调树立全心全意为工农兵服务的思想。我们遵照毛主席理论联系实际的教导，采用从实际需要出发，以工代训，以老带新，干中学、学中干的方法进行训练。施工部队外伤多，我们就先学止血、包扎、固定等技术；夏天就先学防治肠道传染病，冬天就学医治呼吸道感染病。同时还采取见病讲病，一面治疗，一面学习的方法，在治疗中进行学习。在手术操作中，既大胆放手，又严格按照科学办事。在训练中，我们继承了我军“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的光荣传统，不管是医生或卫生员，谁擅长什么，谁就教什么，调动了大家互教互学的积极性。通过在职训练，我团卫生员中已有三十一个同志，在医生指导下，能做外科常见的中、小型手术，有十七个卫生员能用七十到一百余种药，有八名卫生员已经担任了医生（医助）的工作。现在我们团基本上做到了常见的外科小手术不出营，常见的外科中型手术不出团。去年，三连指导员刘士端患急性阑尾炎，卫生员许进元同志给他做了手术，一期愈合，七天出院。刘士端同志赞扬说：“咱们这些‘土’医生真了不起！”
    建立革命的医护合作制度
    在我们为工农兵而破、为工农兵而立的过程中，我们还打破了资产阶级的医护界线，建立了革命的医护合作的制度。过去，医护人员截然分工，在医生和卫生员之间造成一条人为的界线，加大了脑力劳动和体力劳动的距离，破坏了我军官兵一致的光荣传统。
    建队初期，由于医护截然分工，也出现了一些不正常的现象：医生只管看病，开处方，写医嘱；卫生员只管护理，搞清洁卫生，按医嘱办事。有的卫生员说：“医生的嘴，卫生员的腿。”医生和卫生员之间的关系不够密切，不够协调。我们支部认为：这种资产阶级的医护界线分得越清，同志之间距离越远，既不利于医生的思想革命化，又不利于工作作风的革命化，对发扬我军官兵一致的光荣传统也妨碍很大。特别是在人员少，工作繁重的情况下，更影响了工作的开展。
    怎样改变这种状况呢？支部发动大家进行讨论。在讨论中，大家认为：必须打破这种资产阶级的医护界线，建立起革命的医护合作的新制度。只有这样，才能促进人的思想革命化和工作作风的革命化，更好地为工农兵服务。于是，我们以打破资产阶级医护界线为题，在全队开展了一次革命大批判，狠批大叛徒刘少奇推行的修正主义医疗卫生路线。在提高思想，统一认识的基础上，我们还逐步摸索了一些办法：一是医生参加护理工作，卫生员学习参加治疗工作；二是团卫生队的医生、卫生员和营、连的医生、卫生员，根据情况不定期的轮换；三是干部、医生和卫生员认真实行“五同”，同学习、同斗私批修、同吃、同住、同劳动，特别强调领导干部和医生参加体力劳动锻炼。三年来，我们领取各种药品、器材，都是自己搬运；伤病员的被褥和手术敷料，都是自己动手拆洗；队长动手垒猪圈，医生种菜、做饭、刷痰盂，什么都干；就连上药用的棉花棒，也是大家动手加工制作的。
    医护合作制度的建立，大大促进了我们卫生队的思想革命化和工作作风的革命化，进一步密切了官兵关系，发扬了我军官兵一致的光荣传统。医生说：“医护合作，使我们医生丢掉了臭架子，增强了劳动观点，避免了脱离群众，对我们改造思想大有好处。”卫生员说：“医生和我们同样工作，一起劳动，觉得他们更亲切了。”
    我们体会到：破除资产阶级、修正主义的条条框框的过程，就是提高我们为工农兵服务的自觉性的过程。破得越狠，离工农兵越近。只有彻底肃清修正主义路线的影响和流毒，才能更好地沿着毛主席指示的全心全意为工农兵服务的道路前进。（附图片）
