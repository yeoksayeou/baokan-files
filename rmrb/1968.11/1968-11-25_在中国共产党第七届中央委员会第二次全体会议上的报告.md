Title: Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

After the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin Campaigns, the main forces of the Nationalist Party have been annihilated. The Nationalist Party's combat troops now total only about one million, scattered across a vast area from Xinjiang to Taiwan and along a lengthy front. The methods to deal with these remaining one million Nationalist troops are limited to the Tianjin, Beijing, and Suifen methods. Using combat to resolve the issue, as we did in Tianjin, remains our primary focus and preparation. The entire command and fighting forces of the People's Liberation Army must not relax their combat will. Any thought of relaxing combat will or underestimating the enemy is wrong. The possibility of resolving issues in the Beijing manner has increased, which means forcing the enemy to surrender and quickly and thoroughly reorganize their forces according to the People's Liberation Army's system through peaceful means. This method is less effective in swiftly eliminating revolutionary remnants and purging revolutionary political influence compared to resolving issues through war. However, this method is inevitable after the main enemy forces have been annihilated and is beneficial to our army and the people, as it can avoid casualties and destruction. Therefore, all field army leaders should pay attention to and learn this method of struggle. This is a form of struggle, a non-bloody form of struggle, but it is not a struggle that can be resolved without effort. The Suifen method involves intentionally preserving a portion of the Nationalist forces, leaving them largely intact or making only minor adjustments, which means temporarily compromising with this portion of the forces to politically align them with us or keep them neutral. This allows us to concentrate our efforts on resolving the main part of the Nationalist remnants first, and then reorganize this portion of the forces according to the People's Liberation Army's system after a certain period (such as a few months, half a year, or one year). This is another form of struggle. This form of struggle will retain more revolutionary remnants and revolutionary political influence compared to the Beijing method, and the retention period will be longer. However, these revolutionary remnants and revolutionary political influence will ultimately be purged, which is undeniable. We must not think that revolutionary forces have surrendered to us, so their revolutionary thoughts and revolutionary intentions no longer exist. This is not the case. Many of them will be reformed, some will be eliminated, and some determined counter-revolutionaries will be suppressed.

The People's Liberation Army will forever be a fighting force. Even after national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialism exists internationally, our army will remain a fighting force. There must be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point. The People's Liberation Army is also a work force, especially in the southern regions where problems are resolved in the Beijing or Suifen manner. As combat gradually decreases, the role of the work force increases. There is a possibility that in the not-too-distant future, the entire People's Liberation Army will be transformed into a work force. We must be prepared for this. The current 53,000 cadres preparing to march south are insufficient for the extremely vast new regions we will soon occupy. We must prepare to transform the 2.1 million field army into a work force. In this way, there will be enough cadres, and work in vast regions can be expanded. We must regard the 2.1 million field army as a massive cadre school.

From 1927 to now, our work focus has been in the countryside, gathering strength in the countryside to surround the cities and then taking the cities. The period for adopting this work method has now ended. From now on, it is the period of moving from cities to the countryside and leading the countryside from the cities. The Party's work focus has shifted from the countryside to the cities. In the southern regions, the People's Liberation Army will first occupy the cities and then the countryside. Cities and the countryside must be considered together, and city work and countryside work, workers and peasants, industry and agriculture must be closely linked. We must not abandon the countryside and focus solely on the cities; if we think this way, it is completely wrong. However, the Party and the army's work focus must be on the cities, and we must make great efforts to learn how to manage and build cities. We must learn to fight against imperialists, the Nationalist Party, and the bourgeoisie in cities politically, economically, and culturally, and to fight against imperialists diplomatically. We must learn to fight openly with them and also learn to fight covertly. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight with these people and achieve victory in the fight, we will not be able to maintain power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail. After the armed enemies have been eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise these issues and recognize them in this way now, we will make a grave mistake.

In urban struggles, who do we rely on? Some confused comrades think it is not the working class but the poor masses. Some even more confused comrades think it is the bourgeoisie. In terms of developing industry, some confused comrades think it is not mainly to help state-owned enterprises develop but to help private enterprises develop; or conversely, they think that focusing on state-owned enterprises is enough, and private enterprises are insignificant. We must criticize these confused thoughts. We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite other laboring masses, win over intellectuals, and win over as many nationalist bourgeoisie and their representatives as possible to stand on our side or remain neutral. This will enable us to firmly fight against imperialists, the Nationalist Party, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and gradually defeat these enemies. At the same time, we will begin our construction work and gradually learn to manage cities and restore and develop urban production. Regarding the restoration and development of production, we must determine: first, state-owned industrial production; second, private industrial production; third, handicraft production. From the day we take over the cities, our eyes must be on the restoration and development of the city's production. We must avoid blindly grabbing at things and forgetting the central task, resulting in occupying a city for several months without the production and construction work on track, and even many industries in a state of stagnation, causing worker unemployment and lowered living standards, and dissatisfaction with the Communist Party. This situation is completely unacceptable. For this reason, our comrades must make great efforts to learn production technology and production management methods, and learn commercial work, banking work, and other work closely related to production. Only by restoring and developing urban production and turning consumption cities into production cities can the people's regime be consolidated. Other work in the cities, such as Party organization work, government work, trade union work, other mass organizations, cultural and educational work, rectification work, news agencies, newspapers, radio, and television work, all revolve around the central task of production and construction and serve this central task. If we are ignorant of production work, cannot quickly learn production work, and cannot restore and develop production as quickly as possible to achieve real results, first improve the living conditions of workers, and then improve the living conditions of the general public, we will not be able to maintain power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail.

The situation in the south and north is different, so the Party's work tasks must also differ. The south is currently under the rule of the Nationalist Party. Here, the Party and the People's Liberation Army's tasks are to eliminate the Nationalist Party's reactionary armed forces in cities and the countryside, establish Party organizations, establish political power, mobilize the masses, establish trade unions, peasant associations, and other mass organizations, establish people's armed forces, eliminate Nationalist remnants, and restore and develop production. In the countryside, the first step is to gradually launch the campaign to eliminate bandits and oppose local tyrants, the ruling class of landlords, and complete the preparatory work for rent reduction and interest reduction. This will enable the People's Liberation Army to achieve the task of rent reduction and interest reduction in that region approximately one or two years after arriving, creating the prerequisite for land distribution; at the same time, we must pay attention to maintaining the current level of agricultural production and prevent it from declining. In the north, except for a few newly liberated areas, the situation is completely different. Here, the Nationalist Party's rule has been overthrown, and people's rule has been established, and the land issue has been fundamentally resolved. The Party's central task here is to mobilize all forces to restore and develop production, which is the focus of all work. At the same time, we must restore and develop cultural and educational undertakings, eliminate residual reactionary forces, consolidate the entire north, and support the People's Liberation Army.

We have already carried out extensive economic construction work, and the Party's economic policies have been implemented in actual work and achieved remarkable results. However, there are many confused thoughts within the Party regarding why we should adopt such economic policies and not other policies, and on theoretical and principled issues. How should we answer this question? We believe it should be answered as follows. Before the War of Resistance, the proportion of industry and agriculture in China's national economy, on a national scale, was approximately 10% for modern industry and 90% for agriculture and handicrafts. This is the result of imperialist and feudal oppression of China, the economic manifestation of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of old China, and the basic starting point for all issues during the period of the Chinese revolution and after the revolution's victory for a considerable period. From this point, a series of strategic, tactical, and policy issues for our Party have arisen. Further clear recognition and resolution of these issues are an important task for our Party at present. That is to say:

First, China already has approximately 10% modern industry, which is progressive and different from ancient times. Because of this, China has new classes and new parties—the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the proletarian party and the bourgeois party. The proletariat and its party, due to being oppressed by multiple enemies, have been tempered and have the qualifications to lead the Chinese people's revolution. Anyone who ignores or underestimates this will commit the error of right opportunism.

Second, China still has approximately 90% of the dispersed and individual agricultural and handicraft economy, which is backward and not much different from ancient times. We still have approximately 90% of our economic life stuck in ancient times. Ancient times had feudal land ownership, which we have abolished or are about to abolish, and in this respect, we have or are about to distinguish ourselves from ancient times, gaining or about to gain the possibility of gradually developing our agriculture and handicrafts towards modernization. However, today and in the next considerable period, our agriculture and handicrafts, in their basic form, are still and will be dispersed and individual, that is, similar to ancient times. Anyone who ignores or underestimates this will commit the error of "left" opportunism.

Third, although the output value of China's modern industry is still only about 10% of the national economic total, it is highly concentrated, and the largest and most important capital is in the hands of imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Seizing these capitals and placing them under the ownership of the People's Republic led by the proletariat enables the People's Republic to control the economic lifeline of the country, making the state-owned economy the leading component of the entire national economy. This part of the economy is a socialist economy, not a capitalist economy. Anyone who ignores or underestimates this will commit the error of right opportunism.

Fourth, China's private capitalist industry ranks second in modern industry and is an irresistible force. The Chinese national bourgeoisie and their representatives, due to being oppressed or restricted by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, often adopt a participating or neutral stance in the people's democratic revolution struggle. Due to these and due to China's economy still being in a backward state, after the revolution's victory for a considerable period, it is still necessary to make the most of the initiative of urban and rural private capitalism for the development of the national economy. In this period, all capitalist components that are not harmful but beneficial to the national economy should be allowed to exist and develop. This is not only unavoidable but also economically necessary. However, the existence and development of Chinese capitalism are not unrestricted as in capitalist countries. It will be restricted from several aspects—activity scope, tax policy, market price, and labor conditions. We must, according to the specific circumstances of each place, industry, and period, adopt a flexible and appropriate restrictive policy towards capitalism. Sun Yat-sen's slogan of "regulating capital" must still be used and is applicable. However, for the benefit of the entire national economy and the current and future interests of the working class and laboring people, we must not restrict private capitalist economy too much or too rigidly, allowing them to have room to exist and develop within the economic policy and economic plan of the People's Republic. Restricting private capitalism will inevitably face resistance from the bourgeoisie in various degrees and forms, especially the large enterprise owners, the big capitalists. Restriction and anti-restriction will be the main form of class struggle within the new democratic state. If we think we do not need to restrict capitalism now and abandon the slogan of "regulating capital," this is completely wrong and is the viewpoint of right opportunism. However, conversely, if we think we should restrict private capital too much or too rigidly, or even think we can quickly eliminate private capital, this is also completely wrong and is the viewpoint of "left" opportunism or adventurism.

Fifth, the dispersed and individual agricultural and handicraft economy, accounting for 90% of the national economic total output, can and must be cautiously, gradually, and actively guided towards modernization and collectivization. The viewpoint of letting things take their course is wrong. We must organize production, consumption, and credit cooperatives and the leading organs of cooperatives at the central, provincial, municipal, county, and district levels. These cooperatives are collective economic organizations of the laboring masses based on private ownership under the leadership of the proletarian state power. The cultural backwardness of the Chinese people and the lack of cooperative traditions may cause us to encounter difficulties; however, we can organize, must organize, and must promote and develop. Without state-owned economy and without cooperative economy, we cannot lead the individual economy of the laboring masses to gradually move towards collectivization, cannot move from the new democratic society to the future socialist society, and cannot consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the state power. Anyone who ignores or underestimates this will also make a grave mistake. State-owned economy is socialist, cooperative economy is semi-socialist, and adding private capitalism, individual economy, and state-capitalist economy, which is a combination of state and private, these are the main economic components of the People's Republic, and these constitute the new democratic economic form.

Sixth, the recovery and development of the national economy of the People's Republic is impossible without a foreign trade control policy. From the elimination of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Nationalist Party's rule within China's borders (this is the concentrated expression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism), the problem of establishing an independent and complete industrial system has not been solved. Only when the economy has achieved extensive development, transforming China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, can this problem be finally solved. To achieve this goal, foreign trade control is impossible. After the Chinese revolution achieves national victory and solves the land problem, China still has two basic contradictions. The first is domestic, that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The second is international, that is, the contradiction between China and imperialist countries. Because of this, the state power led by the working class in the People's Republic, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, is not to be weakened but must be strengthened. The internal regulation of capital and external control of trade are the two basic policies of this state in economic struggle. Anyone who ignores or underestimates this will make a grave mistake.

Seventh, China's economic heritage is backward, but the Chinese people are brave and industrious. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the assistance of the working class of all countries in the world, mainly the assistance of the Soviet Union, will make the speed of China's economic construction not slow but relatively fast. The prosperity of China can be calculated day by day. The pessimistic view of China's economic revival has no basis.

Old China was a semi-colonial country controlled by imperialism. The thorough anti-imperialist nature of the Chinese people's democratic revolution has made imperialists extremely hostile to this revolution and have done their utmost to help the Nationalist Party. This has further aroused the deep hatred of the Chinese people towards imperialists and made imperialists lose their last bit of prestige among the Chinese people. At the same time, the entire imperialist system has been greatly weakened after World War II, and the strength of the anti-imperialist front led by the Soviet Union has grown unprecedentedly. All these circumstances allow us to adopt and should adopt the policy of gradually and thoroughly destroying imperialist control in China. Imperialist control is manifested in politics, economics, and culture. In every city and place where the Nationalist Party's army has been annihilated and the Nationalist Party government has been overthrown, imperialist political control has also been overthrown, and their economic and cultural control has also been overthrown. However, imperialist direct economic and cultural enterprises still exist, and foreign diplomats and journalists recognized by the Nationalist Party still exist. We must properly resolve these issues separately, in order of priority. We do not recognize the legitimacy of any foreign diplomatic agencies and diplomats from the Nationalist Party era, do not recognize the continued existence of all treasonous treaties from the Nationalist Party era, abolish all imperialist propaganda agencies in China, immediately control foreign trade, and reform the customs system. These are the steps we must first take when entering major cities. After doing these, the Chinese people will stand up in front of imperialism. The remaining imperialist economic and cultural enterprises can be allowed to temporarily exist, and we will supervise and control them, awaiting resolution after our national victory. Ordinary foreigners should be protected in their legal interests and not harmed. Regarding the issue of imperialist recognition of our country, we should not rush to resolve it now and should not rush to resolve it even after national victory for a certain period. We are willing to establish diplomatic relations with all countries on the basis of equality, but imperialists who have always been hostile to the Chinese people cannot quickly treat us with equality. As long as they do not change their hostile attitude, we will not give imperialist countries a legal position in China for even one day. Regarding doing business with foreigners, there is no problem; if there is business, we must do it, and we have already started doing it. Several capitalist countries' merchants are competing with each other. We must first do business with socialist countries and people's democratic countries as much as possible, while also doing business with capitalist countries.

All conditions for convening the Political Consultative Conference and establishing a coalition government have matured. All democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-partisan democrats stand on our side. The bourgeoisie in Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin are establishing relations with us. North-South communication and postal services have begun. The Nationalist Party, which is in disarray, has already detached itself from all the masses. We are preparing to negotiate with the reactionary government in Nanjing. The driving force in the negotiations on the side of the Nanjing reactionary government is the Guangxi warlords, the Nationalist Party's peace faction, and the Shanghai bourgeoisie. Their goal is to have a share in the coalition government, preserve as many troops as possible, preserve the interests of the Shanghai and southern bourgeoisie, and strive to make the revolution take on a mild color. This faction acknowledges the eight points as the basis for negotiations but hopes to bargain and reduce their losses. Those who intend to sabotage these negotiations are Chiang Kai-shek and his diehards. Chiang Kai-shek still has 60 divisions in the Jiangnan area and is still preparing for war. Our policy is not to reject negotiations, demanding that the other side fully acknowledges the eight points and not allowing bargaining. The exchange condition is not to fight the Guangxi faction and other Nationalist peace factions; do not reorganize their troops for about a year; allow some personnel from the Nanjing government to join the Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government; allow certain interests of the Shanghai and southern bourgeoisie to be protected. This negotiation is comprehensive, and if successful, it will reduce many obstacles for our southward advance and occupation of major southern cities, which is very beneficial. If unsuccessful, then conduct local negotiations after the advance. The negotiation time is planned for late March. We hope to occupy Nanjing in April or May, then convene the Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, establish the coalition government, and set Beijing as the capital. Since we allow negotiations, we must prepare for many troubles after the negotiations are successful and have a clear mind to deal with the other side's policy of using Sun Wukong to enter the Iron Fan Princess's belly to cause trouble. As long as we are mentally prepared, we can defeat any Sun Wukong causing trouble. Whether it is comprehensive peace negotiations or local peace negotiations, we should prepare in this way. We should not fear trouble or seek tranquility and not accept these negotiations, nor should we accept these negotiations blindly. Our principles must be firm, and we must also have all the necessary and permissible flexibility to achieve these principles.

The proletarian-led people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance requires our Party to seriously unite all workers, all peasants, and a broad range of revolutionary intellectuals. These are the leading and basic forces of this dictatorship. Without this unity, this dictatorship cannot be consolidated. At the same time, it also requires our Party to unite as many urban petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie representatives as possible, their intellectuals, and political factions that can cooperate with us. This will isolate counter-revolutionary forces during the revolutionary period, thoroughly defeat domestic counter-revolutionary forces and imperialist forces; after the revolution's victory, quickly restore and develop production, deal with foreign imperialism, and steadily transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, building China into a great socialist country. Because of this, our Party's policy of long-term cooperation with non-Party democrats must be established in the Party's thoughts and work. We must regard the majority of non-Party democrats as our own cadres, sincerely and frankly consult and resolve those issues that must be consulted and resolved with them, give them work to do, ensure they have positions and power in their work, and make them achieve results in their work. Starting from uniting them, we must seriously and appropriately criticize or struggle with their errors and shortcomings to achieve the goal of uniting them. Adopting an indulgent attitude towards their errors or shortcomings is wrong. Adopting a closed-door or perfunctory attitude towards them is also wrong. Every major city and medium-sized city, every strategic region, and every province should cultivate a group of authoritative non-Party democrats who can cooperate with us. The incorrect attitude towards non-Party democrats fostered by the closed-doorism of the land revolution war period within our Party has not been completely overcome during the anti-Japanese war period and has re-emerged during the land reform high tide in various base areas in 1947. This attitude will only isolate our Party, make the people's democratic dictatorship unstable, and give the enemy allies. Now, the first Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of our Party is about to be held, the coalition government is about to be established, the revolution is about to achieve national victory, and the entire Party must have a serious review and correct understanding of this issue, must oppose the right opportunism of indulgence and the "left" opportunism or perfunctoryism of closed doors, and adopt a completely correct attitude.

We will soon achieve national victory. This victory will break through the imperialist eastern front and has great international significance. Seizing this victory will not take much time or effort; consolidating this victory will take a long time and require great effort. The bourgeoisie doubts our construction capabilities. Imperialists estimate that we will eventually have to beg them to survive. Because of the victory, arrogance, pride, stagnation, and unwillingness to progress may grow within the Party. Because of the victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to praise us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, which has been proven. The bourgeoisie's praise may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be such communists who have not been conquered by armed enemies, who are not ashamed to be called heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation. Seizing national victory is only the first step of a long march of ten thousand miles. If this step is worth being proud of, it is relatively insignificant, and what is more worth being proud of is still ahead. In several decades, looking back at the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, people will feel that it was only a short prologue of a long play. The play must start with the prologue, but the prologue is not the climax. China's revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain the attitude of hard struggle. We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism from Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad habits and maintain good habits. We can learn things we did not know before. We not only excel at destroying an old world, but we will also excel at building a new world. The Chinese people can not only survive without begging from imperialists but will also live better than imperialist countries. The second plenary session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held from March 5 to March 13, 1949, in Xibaipo Village, Ping Mountain County, Hebei Province. Attending were 34 central committee members and 19 alternate central committee members. This meeting was held on the eve of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution nationwide and was a very important meeting. Comrade Mao Zedong's report at this meeting proposed the various policies to promote the rapid achievement of national victory and organize this victory; explained that after national victory, the Party's work focus must shift from the countryside to the cities; and stipulated the basic policies the Party should adopt in politics, economics, and diplomacy after national victory, as well as the general tasks and main paths for transforming China from an agricultural country into an industrial country and from a new democratic society into a socialist society. In this report, Comrade Mao Zedong particularly analyzed the situation of various economic components in China at that time and the correct policies the Party must adopt, pointing out the path for China to achieve socialist transformation, criticizing various "left" and right deviations on this issue, and affirming that China's economic development will have a relatively high speed. Comrade Mao Zedong estimated the new situation of domestic and international class struggle after the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution and timely warned that the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie would become the main danger to the proletariat. All these make this document have great significance for a long historical period. Comrade Mao Zedong's report and his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" written in June of the same year constitute the policy basis for the "Common Program" adopted by the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which played the role of a provisional constitution after the founding of New China. The second plenary session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's report, adopted the corresponding resolutions. After this meeting, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China moved from Xibaipo Village, Ping Mountain County, Hebei Province, to Beijing.

    在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告
    （一九四九年三月五日）
    毛泽东
    一
    辽沈、淮海、平津三战役以后，国民党军队的主力已被消灭。国民党的作战部队仅仅剩下一百多万人，分布在新疆到台湾的广大的地区内和漫长的战线上。今后解决这一百多万国民党军队的方式，不外天津、北平、绥远三种。用战斗去解决敌人，例如解决天津的敌人那样，仍然是我们首先必须注意和必须准备的。人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。按照北平方式解决问题的可能性是增加了，这就是迫使敌军用和平方法，迅速地彻底地按照人民解放军的制度改编为人民解放军。用这种方法解决问题，对于反革命遗迹的迅速扫除和反革命政治影响的迅速肃清，比较用战争方法解决问题是要差一些的。但是，这种方法是在敌军主力被消灭以后必然地要出现的，是不可避免的；同时也是于我军于人民有利的，即是可以避免伤亡和破坏。因此，各野战军领导同志都应注意和学会这样一种斗争方式。这是一种斗争方式，是一种不流血的斗争方式，并不是不用斗争可以解决问题的。绥远方式，是有意地保存一部分国民党军队，让它原封不动，或者大体上不动，就是说向这一部分军队作暂时的让步，以利于争取这部分军队在政治上站在我们方面，或者保持中立，以便我们集中力量首先解决国民党残余力量中的主要部分，在一个相当的时间之后（例如在几个月，半年，或者一年之后），再去按照人民解放军制度将这部分军队改编为人民解放军。这是又一种斗争方式。这种斗争方式对于反革命遗迹和反革命的政治影响，较之北平方式将要保留得较多些，保留的时间也将较长些。但是这种反革命遗迹和反革命政治影响，归根到底要被肃清，这是毫无疑问的。决不可以认为反革命力量顺从我们了，他们就成了革命党了，他们的反革命思想和反革命企图就不存在了。决不是这样。他们中的许多人将被改造，他们中的一部分人将被淘汰，某些坚决反革命分子将受到镇压。
    二
    人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。人民解放军又是一个工作队，特别是在南方各地用北平方式或者绥远方式解决问题的时候是这样。随着战斗的逐步地减少，工作队的作用就增加了。有一种可能的情况，即在不要很久的时间之内，将要使人民解放军全部地转化为工作队，这种情况我们必须估计到。现在准备随军南下的五万三千个干部，对于不久将要被我们占领的极其广大的新地区来说，是很不够用的，我们必须准备把二百一十万野战军全部地化为工作队。这样，干部就够用了，广大地区的工作就可以展开了。我们必须把二百一十万野战军看成一个巨大的干部学校。
    三
    从一九二七年到现在，我们的工作重点是在乡村，在乡村聚集力量，用乡村包围城市，然后取得城市。采取这样一种工作方式的时期现在已经完结。从现在起，开始了由城市到乡村并由城市领导乡村的时期。党的工作重心由乡村移到了城市。在南方各地，人民解放军将是先占城市，后占乡村。城乡必须兼顾，必须使城市工作和乡村工作，使工人和农民，使工业和农业，紧密地联系起来。决不可以丢掉乡村，仅顾城市，如果这样想，那是完全错误的。但是党和军队的工作重心必须放在城市，必须用极大的努力去学会管理城市和建设城市。必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。既要学会同他们作公开的斗争，又要学会同他们作荫蔽的斗争。如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。
    四
    在城市斗争中，我们依靠谁呢？有些糊涂的同志认为不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠贫民群众。有些更糊涂的同志认为是依靠资产阶级。在发展工业的方向上，有些糊涂的同志认为主要地不是帮助国营企业的发展，而是帮助私营企业的发展；或者反过来，认为只要注意国营企业就够了，私营企业是无足轻重的了。我们必须批判这些糊涂思想。我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够同我们合作的民族资产阶级分子及其代表人物站在我们方面，或者使他们保持中立，以便向帝国主义者、国民党、官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争，一步一步地去战胜这些敌人。同时即开始着手我们的建设事业，一步一步地学会管理城市，恢复和发展城市中的生产事业。关于恢复和发展生产的问题，必须确定：第一是国营工业的生产，第二是私营工业的生产，第三是手工业生产。从我们接管城市的第一天起，我们的眼睛就要向着这个城市的生产事业的恢复和发展。务须避免盲目地乱抓乱碰，把中心任务忘记了，以至于占领一个城市好几个月，生产建设的工作还没有上轨道，甚至许多工业陷于停顿状态，引起工人失业，工人生活降低，不满意共产党。这种状态是完全不能容许的。为了这一点，我们的同志必须用极大的努力去学习生产的技术和管理生产的方法，必须去学习同生产有密切联系的商业工作、银行工作和其他工作。只有将城市的生产恢复起来和发展起来了，将消费的城市变成生产的城市了，人民政权才能巩固起来。城市中其他的工作，例如党的组织工作，政权机关的工作，工会的工作，其他各种民众团体的工作，文化教育方面的工作，肃反工作，通讯社报纸广播电台的工作，都是围绕着生产建设这一个中心工作并为这个中心工作服务的。如果我们在生产工作上无知，不能很快地学会生产工作，不能使生产事业尽可能迅速地恢复和发展，获得确实的成绩，首先使工人生活有所改善，并使一般人民的生活有所改善，那我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会要失败。

    南方和北方的情况是不同的，党的工作任务也就必须有所区别。南方现时还是被国民党统治的区域。在这里，党和人民解放军的任务是在城市和乡村中消灭国民党的反动武装力量，建立党的组织，建立政权，发动民众，建立工会、农会和其他民众团体，建立人民武装力量，肃清国民党残余势力，恢复和发展生产事业。在乡村中，则是首先有步骤地展开清剿土匪和反对恶霸即地主阶级当权派的斗争，完成减租减息的准备工作，以便在人民解放军到达那个地区大约一年或者两年以后，就能实现减租减息的任务，造成分配土地的先决条件；同时必须注意尽可能地维持农业生产的现有水平不使降低。北方则除少数新解放区以外，是完全另外一种情况。在这里，已经推翻了国民党的统治，建立了人民的统治，并且根本上解决了土地问题。党在这里的中心任务，是动员一切力量恢复和发展生产事业，这是一切工作的重点所在。同时必须恢复和发展文化教育事业，肃清残余的反动力量，巩固整个北方，支援人民解放军。

    我们已经进行了广泛的经济建设工作，党的经济政策已经在实际工作中实施，并且收到了显著的成效。但是，在为什么应当采取这样的经济政策而不应当采取别样的经济政策这个问题上，在理论和原则性的问题上，党内是存在着许多糊涂思想的。这个问题应当怎样来回答呢？我们认为应当这样地来回答。中国的工业和农业在国民经济中的比重，就全国范围来说，在抗日战争以前，大约是现代性的工业占百分之十左右，农业和手工业占百分之九十左右。这是帝国主义制度和封建制度压迫中国的结果，这是旧中国半殖民地和半封建社会性质在经济上的表现，这也是在中国革命的时期内和在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内一切问题的基本出发点。从这一点出发，产生了我党一系列的战略上、策略上和政策上的问题。对于这些问题的进一步的明确的认识和解决，是我党当前的重要任务。这就是说：
    第一，中国已经有大约百分之十左右的现代性的工业经济，这是进步的，这是和古代不同的。由于这一点，中国已经有了新的阶级和新的政党——无产阶级和资产阶级，无产阶级政党和资产阶级政党。无产阶级及其政党，由于受到几重敌人的压迫，得到了锻炼，具有了领导中国人民革命的资格。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁就要犯右倾机会主义的错误。
    第二，中国还有大约百分之九十左右的分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济，这是落后的，这是和古代没有多大区别的，我们还有百分之九十左右的经济生活停留在古代。古代有封建的土地所有制，现在被我们废除了，或者即将被废除，在这点上，我们已经或者即将区别于古代，取得了或者即将取得使我们的农业和手工业逐步地向着现代化发展的可能性。但是，在今天，在今后一个相当长的时期内，我们的农业和手工业，就其基本形态说来，还是和还将是分散的和个体的，即是说，同古代近似的。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁就要犯“左”倾机会主义的错误。
    第三，中国的现代性工业的产值虽然还只占国民经济总产值的百分之十左右，但是它却极为集中，最大的和最主要的资本是集中在帝国主义者及其走狗中国官僚资产阶级的手里。没收这些资本归无产阶级领导的人民共和国所有，就使人民共和国掌握了国家的经济命脉，使国营经济成为整个国民经济的领导成份。这一部分经济，是社会主义性质的经济，不是资本主义性质的经济。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁就要犯右倾机会主义的错误。
    第四，中国的私人资本主义工业，占了现代性工业中的第二位，它是一个不可忽视的力量。中国的民族资产阶级及其代表人物，由于受了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫或限制，在人民民主革命斗争中常常采取参加或者保持中立的立场。由于这些，并由于中国经济现在还处在落后状态，在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内，还需要尽可能地利用城乡私人资本主义的积极性，以利于国民经济的向前发展。在这个时期内，一切不是于国民经济有害而是于国民经济有利的城乡资本主义成份，都应当容许其存在和发展。这不但是不可避免的，而且是经济上必要的。但是中国资本主义的存在和发展，不是如同资本主义国家那样不受限制任其泛滥的。它将从几个方面被限制——在活动范围方面，在税收政策方面，在市场价格方面，在劳动条件方面。我们要从各方面，按照各地、各业和各个时期的具体情况，对于资本主义采取恰如其分的有伸缩性的限制政策。孙中山的节制资本的口号，我们依然必须用和用得着。但是为了整个国民经济的利益，为了工人阶级和劳动人民现在和将来的利益，决不可以对私人资本主义经济限制得太大太死，必须容许它们在人民共和国的经济政策和经济计划的轨道内有存在和发展的余地。对于私人资本主义采取限制政策，是必然要受到资产阶级在各种程度和各种方式上的反抗的，特别是私人企业中的大企业主，即大资本家。限制和反限制，将是新民主主义国家内部阶级斗争的主要形式。如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃“节制资本”的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。但是反过来，如果认为应当对私人资本限制得太大太死，或者认为简直可以很快地消灭私人资本，这也是完全错误的，这就是“左”倾机会主义或冒险主义的观点。
    第五，占国民经济总产值百分之九十的分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济，是可能和必须谨慎地、逐步地而又积极地引导它们向着现代化和集体化的方向发展的，任其自流的观点是错误的。必须组织生产的、消费的和信用的合作社，和中央、省、市、县、区的合作社的领导机关。这种合作社是以私有制为基础的在无产阶级领导的国家政权管理之下的劳动人民群众的集体经济组织。中国人民的文化落后和没有合作社传统，可能使得我们遇到困难；但是可以组织，必须组织，必须推广和发展。单有国营经济而没有合作社经济，我们就不可能领导劳动人民的个体经济逐步地走向集体化，就不可能由新民主主义社会发展到将来的社会主义社会，就不可能巩固无产阶级在国家政权中的领导权。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁也就要犯绝大的错误。国营经济是社会主义性质的，合作社经济是半社会主义性质的，加上私人资本主义，加上个体经济，加上国家和私人合作的国家资本主义经济，这些就是人民共和国的几种主要的经济成份，这些就构成新民主主义的经济形态。
    第六，人民共和国的国民经济的恢复和发展，没有对外贸易的统制政策是不可能的。从中国境内肃清了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党的统治（这是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三者的集中表现），还没有解决建立独立的完整的工业体系问题，只有待经济上获得了广大的发展，由落后的农业国变成了先进的工业国，才算最后地解决了这个问题。而欲达此目的，没有对外贸易的统制是不可能的。中国革命在全国胜利，并且解决了土地问题以后，中国还存在着两种基本的矛盾。第一种是国内的，即工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。第二种是国外的，即中国和帝国主义国家的矛盾。因为这样，工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。对内的节制资本和对外的统制贸易，是这个国家在经济斗争中的两个基本政策。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁就将要犯绝大的错误。
    第七，中国的经济遗产是落后的，但是中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民革命的胜利和人民共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导，加上世界各国工人阶级的援助，其中主要地是苏联的援助，中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。对于中国经济复兴的悲观论点，没有任何的根据。

    旧中国是一个被帝国主义所控制的半殖民地国家。中国人民民主革命的彻底的反帝国主义的性质，使得帝国主义者极为仇视这个革命，竭尽全力地帮助国民党。这就更加激起了中国人民对于帝国主义者的深刻的愤怒，并使帝国主义者丧失了自己在中国人民中的最后一点威信。同时，整个帝国主义制度在第二次世界大战以后是大大地削弱了，以苏联为首的世界反帝国主义阵线的力量是空前地增长了。所有这些情形，使得我们可以采取和应当采取有步骤地彻底地摧毁帝国主义在中国的控制权的方针。帝国主义者的这种控制权，表现在政治、经济和文化等方面。在国民党军队被消灭、国民党政府被打倒的每一个城市和每一个地方，帝国主义者在政治上的控制权即随之被打倒，他们在经济上和文化上的控制权也被打倒。但帝国主义者直接经营的经济事业和文化事业依然存在，被国民党承认的外交人员和新闻记者依然存在。对于这些，我们必须分别先后缓急，给以正当的解决。不承认国民党时代的任何外国外交机关和外交人员的合法地位，不承认国民党时代的一切卖国条约的继续存在，取消一切帝国主义在中国开办的宣传机关，立即统制对外贸易，改革海关制度，这些都是我们进入大城市的时候所必须首先采取的步骤。在做了这些以后，中国人民就在帝国主义面前站立起来了。剩下的帝国主义的经济事业和文化事业，可以让它们暂时存在，由我们加以监督和管制，以待我们在全国胜利以后再去解决。对于普通外侨，则保护其合法的利益，不加侵犯。关于帝国主义对我国的承认问题，不但现在不应急于去解决，而且就是在全国胜利以后的一个相当时期内也不必急于去解决。我们是愿意按照平等原则同一切国家建立外交关系的，但是从来敌视中国人民的帝国主义，决不能很快地就以平等的态度对待我们，只要一天它们不改变敌视的态度，我们就一天不给帝国主义国家在中国以合法的地位。关于同外国人做生意，那是没有问题的，有生意就得做，并且现在已经开始做，几个资本主义国家的商人正在互相竞争。我们必须尽可能地首先同社会主义国家和人民民主国家做生意，同时也要同资本主义国家做生意。

    召集政治协商会议和成立民主联合政府的一切条件，均已成熟。一切民主党派、人民团体和无党派民主人士都站在我们方面。上海和长江流域的资产阶级，正在同我们拉关系。南北通航通邮业已开始。陷于四分五裂的国民党，已经脱离了一切群众。我们正在准备和南京反动政府进行谈判。南京反动政府方面在这个谈判中的推动力量是桂系军阀，国民党主和派和上海资产阶级。他们的目的是使联合政府中有他们一份，尽可能地保存较多的军队，保存上海和南方资产阶级的利益，力求使革命带上温和的色彩。这一派人承认以我们的八条为谈判基础，但是希望讨价还价，使他们的损失不要太大。企图破坏这一谈判的是蒋介石及其死党。蒋介石还有六十个师位于江南一带，他们仍在准备作战。我们的方针是不拒绝谈判，要求对方完全承认八条，不许讨价还价。其交换条件是不打桂系和其他国民党主和派；一年左右也不去改编他们的军队；南京政府中的一部分人员允许其加入政治协商会议和联合政府；对上海和南方资产阶级的某些利益允许给以保护。这个谈判是全面性的，如能成功，对于我们向南方进军和占领南方各大城市将要减少许多阻碍，是有很大利益的。不能成功，则待进军以后各个地进行地方性的谈判。谈判的时间拟在三月下旬。我们希望四月或五月占领南京，然后在北平召集政治协商会议，成立联合政府，并定都北平。我们既然允许谈判，就要准备在谈判成功以后许多麻烦事情的到来，就要准备一副清醒的头脑去对付对方采用孙行者钻进铁扇公主肚子里兴妖作怪的政策。只要我们精神上有了充分的准备，我们就可以战胜任何兴妖作怪的孙行者。不论是全面的和平谈判，或者局部的和平谈判，我们都应当这样去准备。我们不应当怕麻烦、图清静而不去接受这些谈判，我们也不应当糊里糊涂地去接受这些谈判。我们的原则性必须是坚定的，我们也要有为了实现原则性的一切许可的和必需的灵活性。

    无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，要求我们党去认真地团结全体工人阶级、全体农民阶级和广大的革命知识分子，这些是这个专政的领导力量和基础力量。没有这种团结，这个专政就不能巩固。同时也要求我们党去团结尽可能多的能够同我们合作的城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的代表人物，它们的知识分子和政治派别，以便在革命时期使反革命势力陷于孤立，彻底地打倒国内的反革命势力和帝国主义势力；在革命胜利以后，迅速地恢复和发展生产，对付国外的帝国主义，使中国稳步地由农业国转变为工业国，把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。因为这样，我党同党外民主人士长期合作的政策，必须在全党思想上和工作上确定下来。我们必须把党外大多数民主人士看成和自己的干部一样，同他们诚恳地坦白地商量和解决那些必须商量和解决的问题，给他们工作做，使他们在工作岗位上有职有权，使他们在工作上做出成绩来。从团结他们出发，对他们的错误和缺点进行认真的和适当的批评或斗争，达到团结他们的目的。对他们的错误或缺点采取迁就态度，是不对的。对他们采取关门态度或敷衍态度，也是不对的。每一个大城市和每一个中等城市，每一个战略性区域和每一个省，都应当培养一批能够同我们合作的有威信的党外民主人士。我们党内由土地革命战争时期的关门主义作风所养成的对待党外民主人士的不正确态度，在抗日时期并没有完全克服，在一九四七年各根据地土地改革高潮时期又曾出现过。这种态度只会使我党陷于孤立，使人民民主专政不能巩固，使敌人获得同盟者。现在中国第一次在我党领导之下的政治协商会议即将召开，民主联合政府即将成立，革命即将在全国胜利，全党对于这个问题必须有认真的检讨和正确的认识，必须反对右的迁就主义和“左”的关门主义或敷衍主义两种倾向，而采取完全正确的态度。十
    我们很快就要在全国胜利了。这个胜利将冲破帝国主义的东方战线，具有伟大的国际意义。夺取这个胜利，已经是不要很久的时间和不要花费很大的气力了；巩固这个胜利，则是需要很久的时间和要花费很大的气力的事情。资产阶级怀疑我们的建设能力。帝国主义者估计我们终久会要向他们讨乞才能活下去。因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。如果这一步也值得骄傲，那是比较渺小的，更值得骄傲的还在后头。在过了几十年之后来看中国人民民主革命的胜利，就会使人们感觉那好象只是一出长剧的一个短小的序幕。剧是必须从序幕开始的，但序幕还不是高潮。中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。中国人民不但可以不要向帝国主义者讨乞也能活下去，而且还将活得比帝国主义国家要好些。中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议，一九四九年三月五日至十三日举行于河北省平山县西柏坡村。出席的有中央委员三十四人，候补中央委员十九人。这次会议是在中国人民革命全国胜利的前夜召开的，是一次极其重要的会议。毛泽东同志在这次会议上所作的报告，提出了促进革命迅速取得全国胜利和组织这个胜利的各项方针；说明了在全国胜利的局面下，党的工作重心必须由乡村移到城市；规定了党在全国胜利以后，在政治、经济、外交方面应当采取的基本政策，以及使中国由农业国转变为工业国、由新民主主义社会转变为社会主义社会的总的任务和主要途径。毛泽东同志在这个报告里，特别着重地分析了当时中国经济各种成份的状况和党所必须采取的正确政策，指出中国实现社会主义改造的必由之路，批判了在这个问题上的各种“左”右偏向，并且确认中国的经济发展将有较高的速度。毛泽东同志估计了中国人民民主革命胜利以后的国内外阶级斗争的新形势，及时地警告资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”将成为对于无产阶级的主要危险。所有这些，都使这个文件在很长的历史时期中具有伟大意义。毛泽东同志的这个报告，和他在同年六月所写的《论人民民主专政》一文，构成了为中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所通过的、在新中国成立以后曾经起了临时宪法作用的《共同纲领》的政策基础。党的第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议，根据毛泽东同志的报告，通过了相应的决议。在这次会议以后，中共中央就由河北省平山县西柏坡迁往北平。
