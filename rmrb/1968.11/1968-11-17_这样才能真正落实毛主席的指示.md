The *People's Daily* published the suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu to move public primary schools down to the production brigade level to run them. This is excellent! We revolutionary soldiers wholeheartedly approve of it!

Moving all public primary schools down to the production brigade level to run them is a reliable guarantee for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. It is a strategic measure to thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line promoted by Liu Shaoqi, and it is completely in line with the direction of socialist development.

Before I enlisted, I taught for a period at a public primary school in Dingxing Production Brigade, Xiancheng People's Commune, Xian County, Shanxi Province. Due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, our small school, which had only two teachers and over ninety students, implemented a full set of bourgeois "standardized" educational policies. Students did not engage in class struggle and did not participate in brigade production labor. Stopping classes for one day required approval from the school district, and stopping classes for three days required approval from the county education bureau. Poor and lower-middle-class peasant children who exceeded the school age were not allowed to attend school, those who could not pay tuition were not allowed to attend school, and students who missed too many classes due to household chores were forced to drop out. Those with poor grades were not allowed to advance. In our eyes as teachers, as long as the grades were good, regardless of the class background, we liked them and were happy to see them. Some students were poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory, acting like "bookworms" in school and "little masters" at home. Some students were "grade-oriented" in school and "work-point-oriented" in the production team. At that time, various rules and regulations kept most of the poor and lower-middle-class peasant children out of school. Most of the students who were held back or dropped out were from poor and lower-middle-class peasant families.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about tremendous changes across the country, in both urban and rural areas.

This February, when I returned home to visit my family, I saw with my own eyes that the school was now managed by the poor and lower-middle-class peasants. All the students who had previously dropped out were back in school, and the number of students had increased from over ninety in 1963 to one hundred and fifty-two. Even the youngest students understood the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society. The students formed propaganda teams of "Little Red Guards" to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle-class peasants. The poor and lower-middle-class peasants happily said, "Such a people's school, with power in the hands of us poor and lower-middle-class peasants and the doors open to us, is truly excellent!"

Practice has proven that people's schools are the most in line with the wishes of the poor and lower-middle-class peasants. Moving all public primary schools down to the production brigade level to run them is the only way to truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "poor and lower-middle-class peasants managing schools." It is the only way to truly implement the great principle that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." It is the only way to cultivate the successors of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and to forever safeguard the socialist state.

　　这样才能真正落实毛主席的指示
    《人民日报》发表的侯振民、王庆余两位同志关于把公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，好得很！我们革命战士打心眼里赞成！
    所有公办小学下放到大队来办，是贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的一个可靠保证，是彻底粉碎刘少奇推行的修正主义教育路线的一个战略措施，是完全符合社会主义发展方向的。
    入伍前，我在山西省襄汾县汾城公社定兴大队当过一段公办小学教员。由于受了大叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线的影响，在我们那所仅有两个教员、九十多名学生的小学校里，执行了一整套资产阶级“正规化”的教育路线，学生不接触阶级斗争，不参加大队生产劳动。规定停课一天要由学区批准，停课三天要由县文教科批准；贫下中农子女超过学龄不让上学，交不起学费不准上学，因家务劳动缺课多的学生要退学，分数不好的不能升学。在我们教师眼里，只要分数好，不管是哪个阶级出身的，就喜欢，就爱见。有的学生受刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒害，在学校里是“书呆子”，回到家里是“小少爷”；有的学生在学校里是“分数挂帅”，回到生产队是“工分挂帅”。那时，种种清规戒律，把大部分贫下中农子女关在学校门外，留级、退学的学生也绝大多数都是贫下中农子女。
    无产阶级文化大革命，在全国城乡引起了巨大变化。
    今年二月，我回家探亲，亲眼看到学校大权已由贫下中农掌管。原来失学的学生全都复了学，学生由一九六三年的九十多名增加到一百五十二名。很小的学生都懂得了旧社会的苦，新社会的甜。学生们还组成一支支“红小兵宣传队”，向贫下中农热情宣传毛泽东思想。贫下中农高兴地说：“这样的民办学校，权由咱贫下中农掌，门为咱贫下中农开，真是好极啦！”
    实践证明，民办学校是最符合贫下中农愿望的。所有公办小学下放到大队来办，才能真正落实毛主席关于“贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，才能真正贯彻“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针，才能培养出无产阶级所需要的革命事业接班人，永保社会主义江山不变色。
