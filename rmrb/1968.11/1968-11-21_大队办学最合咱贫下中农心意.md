We read through the letter from comrades Hóu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú, as well as the editorial note from the People's Daily, and our hearts were filled with excitement. This letter speaks for all of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We would like to share our thoughts in connection with the situation of our brigade's elementary school.

Since 1961, our brigade has followed Chairman Mao's great directive on "the issue of commune-run and brigade-run schools: those with conditions should be allowed to run them," overcoming numerous difficulties to establish a people-run elementary school. This has solved the problem of poor and lower-middle peasants' children attending school. Over the past seven or eight years, all children of school age in our brigade have been enrolled in school, and the youth have basically eliminated illiteracy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. He attempted to cultivate students into revisionist sprouts and heirs of the bourgeoisie. However, we poor and lower-middle peasants remember Chairman Mao's great teachings on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We promptly saw through Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary tricks and stood firm against this evil wind. We resolutely followed Chairman Mao's directives, treating class struggle as a main course. The school's curriculum and all activities are organized around the red line of class struggle. These students, under the influence and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, honor labor and are selfless, maintaining the character of the working people. Teachers and students, according to the needs of the production team, often work together in the fields; after school, students carry manure baskets to collect manure for the collective, raise pigs, and plant vegetables. Poor and lower-middle peasants happily say: "This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership. Such students have a future and are in line with the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants."

From eight years of running the school, we deeply feel that to run a good brigade-run elementary school and cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, we must have the poor and lower-middle peasants take charge of the educational revolution. In teaching, we should use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbook, with class struggle as the guiding principle, and let students grow and be tempered in the three great revolutionary movements.

### 大队办学最合咱贫下中农心意

    大队办学最合咱贫下中农心意
    我们一口气读完了侯振民、王庆余两位同志的来信和《人民日报》编者按，心情十分激动。这封信说出了咱们贫下中农的心里话。我们想结合咱大队办小学的情况，谈谈自己的意见。
    我们大队从一九六一年起，就遵照毛主席“关于社办、队办学校问题，有条件的应该允许办”的伟大指示，克服重重困难，办起了一所民办小学，解决了贫下中农子女入学问题。七八年来，我们大队七周岁以上的学龄儿童都入了学，青年人基本上扫除了文盲。
    毛主席教导我们说：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”。可是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，却与毛主席大唱反调，疯狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，推行了一条反革命修正主义教育路线。妄图把学生培养成修正主义的苗苗，成为资产阶级的接班人。但是我们贫下中农牢记毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大教导，及时识破了刘少奇的反革命阴谋诡计，顶住了这股妖风。我们坚定地按照毛主席的指示办事，把阶级斗争当成一门主课。学校的课程和一切活动安排，都用阶级斗争这条红线贯穿起来。这些学生在贫下中农的影响和教育下，以劳动为荣，一心为公，保持了劳动人民本色。师生根据生产队的需要，经常一起下地劳动；学生放学回家，就背着粪筐为集体拾粪，养猪，种菜。贫下中农高兴地说：“这都是毛主席领导得好。这样的学生就有出息，就合咱贫下中农的心意。”
    我们从八年办学的实践中，深深体会到，要办好大队民办小学，培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人，就必须由贫下中农掌握教育革命大权，在教学中以毛主席著作为基本课，以阶级斗争为纲，让学生在三大革命中锻炼成长。
