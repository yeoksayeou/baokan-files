There is no struggle within the Party, and the Party would lose its vitality. This is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In class society, class struggle will not cease, and neither will intra-party struggle. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long since pointed out: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If the Party has no contradictions and no struggle to resolve them, the Party's vitality would cease." The Chinese Communist Party, personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, has grown and strengthened from the day of its birth by constantly struggling against "left" and "right" opportunist lines. Without struggle, our Party cannot develop, cannot advance.

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, Chinese Khrushchev, has for decades been vigorously advocating the "Theory of Intra-Party Peace," attempting to abolish active ideological struggle within the Party, strangle the revolutionary spirit of our Party, and bury the life of our Party. How vicious his intentions are!

The "Theory of Intra-Party Peace" is merely a smokescreen. To ask, is there really peace within the Party? The facts are just the opposite. Chinese Khrushchev and his agents have never stopped attacking the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, nor have they stopped their conspiracies to restore capitalism. They recruit traitors, form cliques, and bring traitors, spies, capitalists, and monsters and freaks into the Party, gradually expanding their influence and bit by bit usurping the Party's leadership. Isn't this a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads within the Party? Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the "Theory of Intra-Party Peace" itself is a wanton attack on the Party, aiming to make our Party abandon proletarian dictatorship, make Party members abandon intra-party struggle, and in the long run, turn the Party into a "party of the whole people," a revisionist party. It is extremely malicious.

If we abandon intra-party struggle, the traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party will be able to carry out their activities to restore capitalism without restraint. How dangerous that would be!

Chairman Mao teaches us: Communist Party members "must have vitality, must have a firm revolutionary will," and "at all times and in all places, uphold correct principles and engage in tireless struggle against all incorrect thoughts and actions." However, Chinese Khrushchev's "Theory of Intra-Party Peace" advocates a principle-less peace, attempting to let bourgeois ideology spread freely, attempting to corrupt the Party's organization, and disarm Party members ideologically. If Communist Party members fall for the poison of the "Theory of Intra-Party Peace," they will become politically numb and lifeless, with waning fighting spirit; they will maintain a harmonious attitude towards bourgeois ideology and bad people and deeds; they will remain indifferent to the evil activities of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and restore capitalism. If all Communist Party members become like this, what fighting capacity will the Party have!

In summary, Chinese Khrushchev's "Theory of Intra-Party Peace" aims to strangle the proletarian revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members, to strangle the life of the Party. We must not be fooled by Chinese Khrushchev. Every Communist Party member must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and actively carry out ideological struggle and struggle between the two lines within the Party. Only in this way can our Party become a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy.

    批臭“党内和平论”
    某部卫生科政委　王春生
    党内没有斗争，党就没有生命，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基本原理。在阶级社会里，阶级斗争不会停止，党内斗争也不会停止。伟大领袖毛主席早就英明地指出：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”由伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造的中国共产党，从诞生的那天起，就是在和“左”的、右的机会主义路线的不断斗争中成长壮大起来的。离开斗争，我们的党就不能发展，就不能前进。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，几十年来，极力鼓吹“党内和平论”，妄图取消党内积极的思想斗争，扼杀我们党的革命性，葬送我们党的生命。用心多么狠毒！
    “党内和平论”，只是一个烟幕弹。试问，党内真的太平无事吗？事实正相反。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，一天也没有停止过对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的进攻，一刻也没有停止过阴谋复辟资本主义的活动。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，把叛徒、特务、资本家、牛鬼蛇神拉进党内，在我们党内一步一步地扩大势力，一点一点地篡夺党的领导权。这不是党内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争吗？中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“党内和平论”，本身就是对党的猖狂进攻，目的就是妄图使我们的党放弃无产阶级专政，使党员放弃党内斗争，久而久之，使党变成“全民党”、修正主义的党，真是恶毒透顶。
    如果我们放弃党内斗争，混进党内的叛徒、特务和死不悔改的走资派就能肆无忌惮地进行复辟资本主义的活动，那是多么危险的情景啊！
    毛主席教导我们：共产党员“一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志”，“无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争”。可是中国赫鲁晓夫的“党内和平论”，却宣扬无原则的和平，妄图让资产阶级思想自由泛滥，妄图腐蚀党的组织，解除共产党员思想上的武装。共产党员如果中了“党内和平论”的毒，就会在政治上麻木不仁，死气沉沉，斗志衰退；就会对资产阶级思想，对坏人坏事，保持一团和气；就会对党内一小撮走资派反对毛泽东思想、复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，行若无事。如果共产党员都成了这样的人，党还有什么战斗力！
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫的“党内和平论”就是要扼杀共产党员的无产阶级革命精神，就是要扼杀党的生命。我们千万不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，我们每一个共产党员都要牢记毛主席的教导，积极开展党内的思想斗争、两条路线的斗争。这样，我们的党才能成为能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。
