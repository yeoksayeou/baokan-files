The Japanese "Mao Zedong Thought Study Society" issued a statement on the 2nd, warmly hailing the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The statement said: "The communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is not only of great historical significance to the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, but also to the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world, including Japan. This is another brilliant and great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We, with boundless enthusiasm and infinite respect, hail the publication of the communiqué, and we sincerely shout: 'Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!' 'Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong!'"

The statement said, the plenary session communiqué is a mobilization order for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "It is a great support and a tremendous encouragement to the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world."

The statement pointed out: "To permanently expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party and to remove all his positions within and outside the Party, and to thoroughly expose his crimes, means to uproot another source of modern revisionism in the international communist movement. This is another great contribution of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the international communist movement. This has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Union."

The statement said: The revolutionary people of Japan should "take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, further strengthen the revolutionary criticism of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon, and thoroughly overthrow them."

The statement warmly hails the Communist Party of China, after the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has prepared sufficient conditions in terms of ideology, politics, and organization for convening the Ninth National Congress.

The statement pointed out: Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "the People's Republic of China will become an even more invincible revolutionary base for the revolutionary people of the world. This will surely make world history advance in great strides."

The statement said: The communiqué clearly points out that the world revolution has entered a great new era, and the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries in the world are developing vigorously. Looking back at the past two years, the revolutionary movement in Japan has been developing day by day. Imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique have fallen into unprecedented difficulties and isolation. The running dogs of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism—the reactionaries of various countries, as well as their running dogs in Japan—the traitorous and reactionary government of Sato and the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuemon—are all facing bankruptcy. The revolutionary people of the world, no matter what difficulties and twists and turns they encounter, will surely achieve new victories.

The statement said: As pointed out in the communiqué, it is necessary to form a broad united front throughout the world to thoroughly smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to dominate the world. In Japan, it is necessary to raise higher the banners of anti-U.S., anti-revisionism, and patriotism, to unite more closely with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, as well as with the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world, and to advance bravely under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    日本“毛泽东思想研究会”欢呼中共八届十二中全会公报发表
    公报具有不可估量的历史意义
    号召日本革命人民以毛泽东思想作武器进一步批判宫本集团
    新华社九日讯　东京消息：日本“毛泽东思想研究会”二日发表声明，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表。
    声明说：“中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的公报，不仅对中国共产党和中国人民，而且对包括日本在内的世界各国的真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，都是一个具有不可估量的历史意义的重要文献。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一个光辉的伟大胜利。我们怀着无比的热情和无限的尊敬，欢呼公报的发表，并且衷心高呼：‘战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！’‘伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！’”
    声明说，全会公报是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员令。“它对全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民是一个巨大的支援和极大鼓舞。”
    声明指出：“永远开除刘少奇出党，并撤消他在党内外的一切职务，彻底地清算他的罪行，意味着铲除了在国际共产主义运动中又一个现代修正主义的根子。这是毛主席和毛泽东思想对国际共产主义运动的又一伟大贡献。这沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联现代修正主义为首的现代修正主义。”
    声明说：日本革命人民要“以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步加强对日共宫本修正主义集团的革命大批判，彻底地打倒他们”。
    声明热烈欢呼中国共产党经过无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，在思想上、政治上、组织上为召开第九次全国代表大会准备了充分的条件。
    声明指出：通过无产阶级文化大革命，“中华人民共和国将成为全世界革命人民的更加坚不可摧的革命根据地。这必将使世界历史更加大踏步地向前发展。”
    声明说：公报明确地指出，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代，全世界各国人民的革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。回顾过去两年，日本革命运动日益发展，以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义已经陷于空前困难和孤立的境地，美帝和苏修的走狗——各国反动派，以及它们在日本的走狗佐藤卖国反动政府和日共宫本修正主义集团都日益陷入破产，世界革命人民不管遇到什么样的困难和曲折都必将取得新的胜利。
    声明说：正如公报所指出的那样，必须在全世界结成一个广泛的统一战线，彻底粉碎美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义妄图霸占世界的阴谋。在日本，则必须更高地举起反美、反修和爱国的旗帜，同中国共产党和中国人民以及全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民更紧密地团结起来，在毛泽东思想指引下奋勇前进。
