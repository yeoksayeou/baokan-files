The great leader Chairman Mao proposed as early as the eve of national liberation that "we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi has always maliciously denigrated, attacked, and slandered our working class. A small clique of capitalist roaders in our factory, following the instructions of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, also slandered the workers, saying: "People are like this, if you don't keep an eye on them, they'll climb up the pole like monkeys." "Give the workers some bonuses to have some money to spend, and production will go up." They implemented "expert management" in the factory, practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the working class; at the same time, they promoted "technology first" and "material incentives," attempting to lead the working class astray, with extremely malicious intentions.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in our factory, relying on a few reactionary technical "authorities," formulated a set of so-called production and technical management systems to control, restrict, and suppress us workers. We workers, in order to improve production efficiency while ensuring quality, carried out innovations to improve processes and combine operations. As a result, not only did we not receive any support, but we were even labeled as violating technical discipline. What was even more infuriating was that the tools and cutters designed by the technical "authorities" were not practical, while the tools and cutters we innovated ourselves processed products quickly and well. However, these reactionaries insisted that workers were not allowed to use them. Therefore, workers had to secretly use their own cutters while working and, to pass inspections, would put the cutters designed by the technical "authorities" on the cutter holders as a show, truly making them "model cutters"! The small clique of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" also, under the guise of ensuring safety, promoted the so-called "dedicated machine operation," stipulating that workers could only operate one type of machine, those operating lathes could not touch milling machines, and even within the lathe worker category, there were distinctions between large, medium, and small lathes. This is how they oppressed us workers, tightly binding our hands and feet.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in our factory. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres in our factory, armed with Chairman Mao's "Anshan Constitution" as a sharp ideological weapon, held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashed the revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, and thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of the small clique of capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" within the party, abolishing all regulations and systems that obstructed the development of productive forces. The new revolutionary committee, with revolution commanding production and Mao Zedong Thought guiding production, emphasized proletarian politics, and launched mass movements. The workers said: "In the past, the capitalist roaders tried to corrupt us with money, but we don't want money or bonuses, what we want is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." "In the past, the capitalist roaders did not believe in us workers, but today we will launch a technological revolution and technological innovation to make Chairman Mao proud." The revolutionary tide surged throughout the factory, production was booming, and reports of technological revolutions and innovations were frequent. In the past, the reactionary technical "authorities" took more than a year to design an installation machine that could not move its feet or straighten its arms. We, the working class, kicked out the "authorities," took matters into our own hands, and successfully designed and manufactured an internationally unique, easy-to-operate, and precise installation machine. Similarly, explosion forming, ion cutting machines, large trimming machines, synthetic diamonds, and so on, were all achievements made by the working class under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought after kicking out the "authorities." The facts have proven: the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has the highest wisdom and can create miracles unparalleled in human history; it has the greatest courage and can forge ahead on paths that no one has ever trodden. The working class must lead everything and will definitely be able to lead everything!

    工人阶级有无限创造力
    洪都机械厂工人　盛国辉
    伟大领袖毛主席早在全国解放前夕就提出：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。而叛徒刘少奇却一贯肆意贬低、攻击、污蔑我们工人阶级。我厂一小撮走资派秉承叛徒刘少奇的旨意，也污蔑工人说：“人这玩意儿，你不管着点，就象猴子要顺着杆子往上爬。”“搞点奖金给工人弄点钱花花，生产才能上得去。”他们在工厂里一面推行“专家治厂”，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政；一面又推行“技术第一”、“物质刺激”，企图把工人阶级引向歧途，用心十分险恶。
    叛徒刘少奇及其在我厂的代理人，依靠少数反动技术“权威”制订一整套所谓的生产技术管理制度，来管、卡、压我们工人。我们工人为了提高生产率，在保证质量的前提下，进行改进工艺合并加工工序的革新，结果不但得不到半点支持，反而扣上违反工艺纪律的罪名。更加令人气愤的是，技术“权威”设计出来的工具和刀具不好用，而我们自己革新搞的工具和刀具，加工产品又快又好，但他们这些反动家伙却硬卡着工人不准使用。于是，工人只好在干活时暗中用自己的刀具，为了应付检查就把技术“权威”设计的刀具装在刀架上做个样子，使它真成了名副其实的“样板刀”！一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”还以保证安全为名，推行所谓包机制，规定工人只能死死地操作一种床子，干车床的不能摸铣床，就是一个车工工种，还分大车、中车、小车。他们就是这样的狠整我们工人，紧紧地束缚着工人的手脚。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命敲响了叛徒刘少奇及其在我厂的代理人的丧钟。我厂广大无产阶级革命派以毛主席的“鞍钢宪法”为锐利的思想武器，高举革命批判大旗，大破了叛徒刘少奇的修正主义办企业路线，大造了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的反，破除了各种阻碍生产力发展的规章制度。新生的革命委员会，用革命统帅生产，用毛泽东思想指挥生产，突出无产阶级政治，大搞群众运动。工人们说：“过去走资派用金钱腐蚀我们，我们不要钱不要奖，我们要的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”“过去走资派不相信我们工人，我们今天要大闹技术革命、技术革新，为毛主席争气。”全厂革命洪流滚滚，生产热气腾腾，技术革命、技术革新捷报频传。过去反动技术“权威”用了一年多的时间，设计了一台脚不能动臂不能直的安装机，我们工人阶级踢开“权威”，自己动手，设计制造成功了一台在国际上独创的、操作灵便、精度准确的安装机。又如爆炸成型、电离子切割机、大型切边机、人造金刚石等等，也都是踢开“权威”，由我们工人阶级在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下取得成功的。事实证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级有着最高的智慧，能创造人间未有的奇迹；有着最大的勇气，能闯出前人未走过的道路。工人阶级必须领导一切，也一定能够领导一切！
