Chairman Mao has said: “Our country has over 30 million minority people, who make up only 6% of the total population, but they live in vast areas, covering about 50% to 60% of the total land area of the country.” “Helping all the minority nationalities to develop and progress is in the interest of the whole country. The development and progress of all the minority nationalities are full of hope.”

We believe that the revolutionary suggestions made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu are excellent measures for rapidly popularizing rural education in minority areas and for carrying out an educational revolution in these areas. The main advantages are as follows:

1. The poor and lower-middle peasants, herdsmen, and hunters among the minority nationalities, who have never had the power of the written word, can rapidly and firmly grasp this power. For example, the vast majority of Yi slaves in Liangshan had no right to live before the democratic reform; after the democratic reform, they still had no say in the running of schools. In some areas, quite a few production brigades found it difficult to find even a scorekeeper, and some brigades even used wooden tablets, bamboo slips, beans, or knots to record work points. If primary schools are run by the production brigades, this situation will certainly change.

2. The broad masses of minority laborers have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and an intense hatred for Liu Shaoqi. Once the power of education is in their hands, it will be possible to carry out the educational revolution in the countryside most rapidly and thoroughly, to implement Chairman Mao’s proletarian educational line forever, and to thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of Liu Shaoqi’s counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

3. It will be possible to popularize rural education in minority areas most rapidly. The minority areas are vast and their foundations are weak. It is impossible to popularize rural education rapidly by relying on state-run schools, and it is impossible to meet the rapid development of revolution and production in the minority areas. For example, in the Hani areas of Yunnan, some communes and production brigades have so few state-run primary schools that children often have to walk 40 to 50 li to go to school, and the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants naturally cannot go to school. In such areas, it is urgent to popularize education.

4. It will be possible to ensure that rural education truly and effectively serves the three great revolutionary movements in the locality. The specific conditions in the various minority areas, such as agricultural, pastoral, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral, and hunting areas, are different. If only one set of textbooks and one teaching arrangement are used for state-run schools, they will certainly be divorced from reality.

5. It will be beneficial for teachers to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to carry out a thorough ideological revolution, and to strengthen national unity. Most of the primary school teachers in the minority areas come from other places or counties. Under the influence of Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist educational line, many teachers often regard themselves as “state cadres” and pay no heed to the production brigades or communes. If the teachers are also commune members, these problems will be solved.

6. It will be beneficial to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and to thoroughly smash Liu Shaoqi’s counter-revolutionary economism in minority education.

7. “To thoroughly solve the national question and completely isolate the national reactionaries, it is impossible without a large number of communist cadres from the minority nationalities.” Running schools by the production brigades will help to train a large number of cadres from the minority nationalities rapidly and efficiently.

8. Most importantly, it will be possible to popularize the Chinese language rapidly and widely, to enable the minority people to read Chairman Mao’s works directly in Chinese, to remove the language barrier, and thus to greatly speed up the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in the minority areas.

In short, there are many advantages in having primary schools run by the production brigades instead of by the state. This measure is not only necessary but also feasible in the minority areas. Although in the course of its implementation, various specific problems may arise because of the “special circumstances” in the minority areas, it will in no way hinder it from being a measure of a guiding nature for carrying out an educational revolution in the minority areas. In the future, we will contribute our efforts to the implementation of this measure in the minority areas.

    少数民族地区普及农村教育的极好措施
    毛主席说：“我国少数民族有三千多万人，虽然只占全国总人口的百分之六，但是居住地区广大，约占全国总面积的百分之五十至六十。”“帮助各少数民族，让各少数民族得到发展和进步，是整个国家的利益。各少数民族的发展和进步都是有希望的。”
    我们认为，侯振民、王庆余二同志的革命建议，是迅速普及少数民族地区农村教育，完成少数民族地区教育革命的极好措施。主要好处是：
    一、从来不曾掌握文权的少数民族贫下中农、贫苦牧民、猎民等广大劳动群众，可以迅速地牢固地掌握文权。如凉山彝族广大奴隶，民主改革前，连生存权也没有；民主改革后，也无权过问办学的事。在若干地区有相当一部分生产队，连找个记分员都很困难，个别生产队甚至用木牌、竹签、大豆或结绳等来记工分。若小学由大队来办，这种现象必将得到改变。
    二、广大少数民族劳动群众，对毛主席无限热爱，对刘少奇无比仇恨。教育大权一经掌握在他们手里，就能保证最迅速最彻底地完成农村教育革命，永远贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒。
    三、能最迅速地在少数民族地区普及农村教育。少数民族地区面积大、底子薄，靠公办是不能迅速普及农村教育的，是不能适应少数民族地区革命、生产的飞速发展的。如云南哈尼族地区，有些社队由于公办小学太少，上小学往往都需走四、五十里路，广大贫下中农子女当然就上不了学。象这样的地区，普及教育显然是刻不容缓的。
    四、能保证农村教育真正地、切实地为当地的三大革命运动服务。各民族地区，如农区、牧区、半农半牧区、猎区等，具体情况各不相同，如果只采用公办的一种教材、一套教学安排，势必脱离实际。
    五、有利于教师接受贫下中农的再教育，搞好思想革命化，有利于加强民族团结。民族地区的小学教师，绝大部分是由外地、外乡去的，在刘少奇修正主义教育路线的毒害下，不少教师常以“国家干部”自居，全然不听大队、公社的，如果教员也作为社员，这些问题就迎刃而解了。
    六、有利于发扬自力更生的革命精神，彻底粉碎刘少奇的对少数民族教育所谓“包下来”的反革命经济主义。
    七、“要彻底解决民族问题，完全孤立民族反动派，没有大批少数民族出身的共产主义干部是不可能的。”大队办学有利于事半功倍地迅速造就一大批从少数民族出身的干部。
    八、最重要的是，可以迅速地、广泛地普及汉语文，为少数民族人民直接阅读汉文版毛主席著作，扫清语言文字障碍，从而大大加速毛泽东思想在民族地区的广泛传播。
    总而言之，公办小学改由大队来办好处甚多。这一措施，在少数民族地区不仅是必要的，而且也是切实可行的，尽管在实行过程中还将因少数民族地区的种种“特殊情况”而碰到这样或那样的具体问题，但无论如何，也不妨碍它是少数民族地区进行教育革命的一项带方向性的措施。我们今后将以实际行动，为在少数民族地区实行这项措施而做出自己的贡献。
