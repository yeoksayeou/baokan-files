The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Throughout the transitional period, there exist class contradictions, there exists the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there exists the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism."

However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi openly defies Chairman Mao's wise instructions and advocates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," claiming that "class struggle has basically ended." This is extremely reactionary!

Take our Panqian Brigade in Beishan Commune, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, for example. Before liberation, poor and lower-middle peasants lived like cattle and horses. Who doesn't have a book of blood and tears, who doesn't have a history of blood and tears? Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came, and the poor and lower-middle peasants held their heads high and became masters. For such a tremendous change, the class enemies will never be willing to accept it. "A toad's skin is peeled off but its eyes don't close, a turtle's belly is cut open but its heart doesn't die." They try to restore the old order every moment and even dream of taking back the "heaven" they have lost.

Liu Shaoqi desperately advocates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" with the intention of making us forget about class struggle, not see the class enemies, and let the class enemies brazenly attack us, seize our power, and restore capitalism. Liu Shaoqi's intentions are so malicious! In fact, the class enemies' activities to restore the old order, besides openly attacking us, are also using this "theory of the extinction of class struggle" as a cover to carry out "peaceful evolution." They pretend to be "obedient" on the surface but secretly fan the flames and stir up trouble, destroying the unity among the poor and lower-middle peasants and the collective economy. The great proletarian cultural revolution has stripped off the class enemies' disguises, and it turns out that they are all wolves in sheep's clothing.

The facts of the class enemies' desperate struggles have given a resounding slap in the face to the advocates of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," Liu Shaoqi. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, smash all the plots of the class enemies to restore capitalism, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    批臭“阶级斗争熄灭论”
    浙江金华县北山公社盘前大队　章讨饭　陈锡奎　田兴华
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。”
    但是，大叛徒刘少奇公然对抗毛主席的英明指示，宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，说什么“阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”。真是反动透顶！
    就拿我们盘前大队来说，解放前，贫下中农过的是牛马不如的生活，谁家没有一本血泪账，谁家没有一部血泪史？毛主席、共产党来了，贫下中农扬眉吐气，成了主人。对于这样一个翻天覆地的变化，阶级敌人是死也不会甘心的。“癞蛤蟆剥皮眼不闭，甲鱼剖肚心不死”，他们每时每刻企图复辟，连做梦也想夺回已经失去的“天堂”。
    刘少奇拚命鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，目的就是要我们忘掉阶级斗争，看不见阶级敌人，让阶级敌人猖狂地向我们进攻，夺我们的权，复辟资本主义。刘少奇用心多么恶毒！事实上，阶级敌人的复辟活动，除了明火执仗地向我们进攻以外，就是利用这个“阶级斗争熄灭论”作掩护，大搞“和平演变”。他们表面上装得“老实”，暗地里却在煽阴风、点鬼火，破坏贫下中农内部的团结，破坏集体经济。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命剥下了阶级敌人的伪装，原来他们都是披着羊皮的狼。
    阶级敌人垂死挣扎的事实，给“阶级斗争熄灭论”的鼓吹者刘少奇一记响亮的耳光。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘阶级斗争，粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的一切阴谋活动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
