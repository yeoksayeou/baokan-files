Workers in various Latin American countries have been continuously launching strike struggles to resist the oppression and exploitation by foreign and domestic monopolistic capital.

In Chile, hundreds of workers and employees of the American-owned Utah Construction Company staged a strike on November 7 to protest the company's brutal exploitation of workers and to demand wage increases and labor safety protections.

Workers at the American-owned Pfizer Pharmaceutical Company also went on strike on November 1 to protest the company's failure to guarantee workers' minimum wages.

In Ecuador, workers at the "Italian United Company" in the country's largest city, Guayaquil, recently launched a strike struggle to fight for their rights. This foreign company is contracted to build a large bridge over the Guayas River and employs a large number of Ecuadorian workers.

In Peru, workers at a textile factory in the city of Huancayo went on a hunger strike to protest the factory owner's long-term withholding of wages and the attempt to refuse payment by declaring "bankruptcy." The workers' families also joined the struggle. Their fight received support from workers in other parts of Peru.

In Colombia, workers at the "Aníbal" Construction Company in the Narino province have been on strike since early October to protest the company's use of extended working hours to intensify their exploitation. The workers have been on strike for more than twenty days. During the strike, they also set up barricades and detained the company's representatives.

Guayaquil, Ecuador: In recent days, the broad masses of young students, workers, and other patriotic people in Ecuador have been continuously holding class boycotts, strikes, and demonstrations to oppose the repression of the people's movement by the pro-American reactionary government and the brutal plundering by American imperialism.

On October 29, thousands of students in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, took to the streets to demonstrate against the dictatorial rule and repression of the student movement by the city's pro-American reactionary mayor, Asad Bucaram.

During the demonstration, the students used stones and homemade incendiary bombs as weapons to engage in fierce struggles with the reactionary police and military who came to suppress them. A police patrol car was hit by an incendiary bomb, injuring three police officers.

The broad masses of young students' anti-dictatorship demonstrations paralyzed the activities of banks, shops, and government agencies in the central area of Guayaquil. Faced with the people's struggle, the Ecuadorian authorities were in a state of panic and declared that the military would take over the city.

At the same time, the educational authorities announced that all middle and primary schools in Guayaquil would be suspended indefinitely to prevent the development of the student movement.

Earlier, workers at the American-owned "National Brewery" in Guayaquil went on a five-day strike in mid-October to demand wage increases. At the beginning of the strike, the workers detained three company representatives, including an American.

In the province of Manabí, a worker strike and merchant shutdown lasting half a month broke out in early October to protest the government's policies that harm public interests.

During this half-month-long strike struggle, all activities in the province of Manabí came to a halt, and traffic was disrupted. In solidarity with the workers of the "Venus" factory in Ambato, the capital of the province of Tungurahua, a general strike was held in mid-October.
