Editor's Note: Today, we publish the suggestion by comrades Hóu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú to transfer the management of public primary schools to production brigades. We invite opinions from poor and lower-middle peasants, rural teachers, and revolutionary masses nationwide to discuss this issue. We warmly welcome revolutionary comrades to continue providing typical experiences and revolutionary initiatives for the urban and rural proletarian education revolution and various fronts of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The newspaper will select and publish the key points.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not continue." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students across the country, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have launched a magnificent education revolution. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools have reached a new high tide. In rural areas, poor and lower-middle peasants have taken over the management of schools, and peasants' enthusiasm for running schools is high, which greatly accelerates the universalization of primary education in rural areas.

Our country is a socialist country, and primary schools should be part of the production brigade. The production brigade has the conditions to lead politically, economically, and in terms of teachers. We suggest that all public primary schools be managed by production brigades. The state will no longer invest or will invest less in primary education funds, and teachers will no longer receive salaries from the state but will be credited with work points by the production brigade. We believe this aligns with the direction of socialist development because the production brigade level should not only handle agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries but also have party, government, and cultural affairs. This also meets the demands of the broad masses of the people, and we believe primary school teachers will welcome this.

The benefits are:

1. It fundamentally changes the revisionist educational line where the county education bureau leads the central school, the central school leads the complete primary school, and the complete primary school leads various primary schools, making primary schools work directly under the leadership of the production brigade party branch.

2. It is beneficial for the re-education of intellectuals. In the past, there was a gap between teachers and commune members, always incompatible, due to the presence of bourgeois ideology among petty intellectuals, who looked down on poor and lower-middle peasants and could not serve them well. Poor and lower-middle peasants were also unwilling to approach them. If primary schools are managed by the production brigade, teachers in the brigade are both teachers and commune members, propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and fighters against selfishness and revisionism. They can also participate in labor and connect with the masses, which is beneficial for the transformation of intellectuals and can also help the brigade's work.

3. It truly implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Since the educational power is returned to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the school becomes their own school, making primary education work not separate from politics, production labor, and the three great revolutionary movements. Teaching work can be closely integrated with production labor, practice, and the masses, cultivating successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

4. Teachers return to work in their own production brigades, and some expelled landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists can return to their own production brigades for supervised labor reform. The children of landlords and rich peasants returning to teach in their own production brigades can also be supervised by the masses.

5. It can reduce the state's burden. Currently, most primary schools are run by the state, and primary school teachers are a large team. Our Maji Community is a small community with only about 21,000 people, with fourteen public primary schools, including five complete primary schools, with a total of fifty-one teaching and administrative staff. The state has to bear a salary of over 20,000 yuan, construction costs of over 3,000 yuan, and commercial grain of 19,584 jin annually. If the production brigade runs the schools, the state can reduce the burden of 23,000 yuan and 19,584 jin of grain, using this money and grain to support industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction.

Due to the reform of the system, involving the living and transfer issues of teachers, we believe the following solutions are better:

1. Salary issue: The state will no longer issue salaries, but instead, work points will be credited. To not lower the original living standard of teachers, appropriate subsidies will be given based on different situations in various regions, the living burden of teachers, the high and low of original salaries, and the quality of work.

2. Teacher adjustment issue: Currently, most public primary school teachers do not work in their own production brigades, and they need to return to work in their own production brigades; otherwise, their families' lives will be difficult to manage. If household registrations are transferred, there are also some practical difficulties. In our Maji Community, out of fifty-one teaching and administrative staff, thirty-five are from the same county, including twenty-five from the same community, and sixteen are from other counties. Our community also has teachers working in other communities and counties. If we adjust them among each other, it will be almost balanced. Culturally backward production brigades with no teachers are extremely rare, and such production brigades can also be adjusted within the community.

3. Primary schools implementing a seven-year continuous system (some also call it primary school with attached junior high school classes) can retain some teachers to teach grades six and seven. The state will bear the salaries and rations because most students in grades six and seven come from several production brigades, making it difficult to bear the burden.

Our suggestion may contain errors, and even if the opinion is correct, there are many practical problems that need to be well studied.

Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

### 建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办

专栏：革命群众来信

　　建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办
　　编者按：今天我们将侯振民、王庆余两位同志关于将公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，在报上发表，公开征求意见，展开讨论，请贫下中农、农村教师和全国广大革命群众都来发表意见。我们热烈欢迎革命的同志们对城、乡无产阶级教育革命和各条战线的斗、批、改继续提供典型经验和提出各种革命倡议，本报将择要予以发表。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”全国广大工人、农民和革命师生遵照毛主席这一最新指示，开展了一场轰轰烈烈的教育革命。学校中的斗、批、改已形成了一个新的高潮。在农村贫下中农管理了学校，农民办学的热情很高，这就大大加速了农村小学的普及教育。
    我们的国家是社会主义国家，小学应是大队的一部分，大队在政治领导、经济、师资等条件上完全能够自己办小学。我们建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办，国家不再投资或少投资小学教育经费，教师国家不再发工资，改为大队记工分。这样做，我们认为是符合社会主义发展方向的，因为大队这一级不但要搞农、林、牧、副、渔，也应有党、政、文等，也符合广大人民群众的要求，这样做我们小学教师也是欢迎的。
    它的好处是：
    1、从根本上改变了那种县文教局领导中心校，中心校领导高完小，高完小领导各小学的修正主义教育路线，使小学直接在大队党支部的领导下进行工作。
    2、有利于对知识分子的再教育。过去教员与社员之间有一条沟，总是格格不入的，这就是小知识分子存有资产阶级思想的缘故，轻视贫下中农，不能很好地为贫下中农服务，贫下中农也就不愿意接近他们。如果小学由大队来办，教师在队里是教员，又是社员，是毛泽东思想的宣传员，又是斗私、批修的战斗员，也能经常参加劳动，联系群众，既有利于知识分子的改造，对大队工作也能起到些帮助作用。
    3、真正落实了毛主席的最新指示：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”由于教育权夺回到贫下中农手中，学校是自己的学校，就能使小学教育工作不脱离政治，不脱离生产劳动，不脱离三大革命运动。教学工作就能与生产劳动、实际、群众紧密地结合起来了，培养出来的接班人，才是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    4、教师都回本大队工作，一些被清出的地、富、反、坏、右分子就可回本大队监督劳动改造。地富子女回本大队教学，也便于受到群众的监督。
    5、可以减轻国家负担。现在大部分小学还是国家办的，小学教师是一支庞大的队伍，我们马集公社是一个仅有两万一千多人口的小公社，有十四处公办小学，其中五处高完小，共有教职员五十一人，每年国家要负担工资二万多元，修建费三千多元，吃商品粮一万九千五百八十四斤。如果大队办，国家就可减轻二万三千元和一万九千五百八十四斤粮食的负担，用这些钱粮支援工、农业生产，支援国防建设。
    由于体制的改革，涉及到教师的生活、调动问题，我们认为这样解决较好：
    1、工资问题：国家不发工资，改为记工分。为了不降低教师的原生活水平，根据各地区不同情况和教师的生活负担、原工资的高低、工作好坏，给予适当补助。
    2、教师调整问题：现在绝大部分公办小学教师不在本大队工作，需要调回本大队工作，不然家属生活没法办，如果迁移户口，也有些实际困难。我们马集公社五十一名教职员中，家在本县的教师就有三十五名，其中本公社里的二十五名，十六名是外县教师。我社也有在外社外县工作的。这样互相递补一下就差不多了。文化落后连教师也没有的大队是极少数，这样的大队也可在社内调济。
    3、实行小学七年一贯制的学校（也有的叫小学附设初中班）也可留下一部分教师教六、七年级，工资、口粮国家负担，因上六、七年级的学生多数牵扯几个大队，不好负担。
    我们这个建议，很可能是错误的东西，即使这个意见正确，也有很多实际问题，需要很好的研究。
    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
