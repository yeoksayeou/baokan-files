	Teachers must thoroughly change their old ideas. Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu suggest that public primary schools be transferred to the management of production brigades. This is not just a matter of reforming the leadership system of rural public primary schools; it is a matter of the struggle between two lines on the educational front. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to smash the superstructure that does not correspond to the socialist economic base. In rural areas, only by transferring public primary schools to the management of production brigades can we thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line.

	An important link in the struggle, criticism, and reform on the cultural and educational front is to clean up the bad elements that have infiltrated the cultural and educational front and to have intellectuals receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. In rural areas, only by transferring public primary schools to the management of production brigades can we better clean up the bad elements that have infiltrated the educational front and supervise their reform.

	For more than a decade, the struggle between the two lines on the educational front in rural areas has been very sharp. The number one capitalist-roader, traitor, spy, and scab in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, in order to restore capitalism, openly opposed the great directive of Chairman Mao Zedong that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." He stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, making rural primary education not only unable to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants but also making students, instead of engaging in productive labor, regard studying as a means to "climb up" and escape from productive labor. Some who climbed up became "refined and distinguished"; those who did not climb up blamed heaven and earth and did not want to farm. Under the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, teachers became "special figures" above ordinary laborers, making some teachers, although living in rural areas, have no common language and no common feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line still has not been completely eradicated from the minds of some teachers. Some primary school teachers still carry the burden of "public" schools and are bound by the framework of "public" schools. Although they are only a few steps away from the production brigades, they cannot go down. Some teachers also say they want to carry out educational revolution, but as soon as they start teaching, they revert to the old ways. For this reason, I think the revolutionary suggestion of comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu is very good. We must carry out a criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, so that all teachers who are willing to revolutionize can undergo a thorough transformation in their thinking. Only then can they respectfully accept the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strictly follow the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and become revolutionary teachers who are warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    教师必须彻底改变旧思想
    侯振民、王庆余两同志建议把公办小学下放到大队来办，这不仅仅是一个农村公办小学的领导体制的改革问题，而且是一个教育战线上两条路线斗争的问题。无产阶级文化大革命，要打碎不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。在农村，只有把公办小学下放到大队来办，才能彻底砸烂修正主义教育路线。文教战线的斗、批、改很重要的一环，就是要清理钻进文教战线的坏人，就是要知识分子接受工农兵的再教育。在农村，只有把公办小学下放到大队来办，才能更好地清理钻进教育战线的坏人，监督他们改造。
    十几年来，农村教育战线两条路线的斗争非常尖锐。党内头号走资派、叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，为了复辟资本主义，公然对抗伟大领袖毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针，顽固推行反革命修正主义教育路线，使农村小学教育不仅不能为贫下中农服务，培养学生不仅脱离生产劳动，反而引导学生把读书作为脱离生产劳动“向上爬”的桥梁。有的人爬上去，就“洋里洋气，出人头地”；有的人没上去，就怨天怨地，不想种地。在叛徒刘少奇的这条修正主义教育路线的毒害下，教师也就成了高于普通劳动者的“特殊人物”，使得有些教师虽然身在农村，但是和贫下中农没有共同语言，没有共同的思想感情。现在叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，在有些教师的头脑里也还没有完全肃清。有些小学教师，仍然背着“公办”学校的包袱，套着“公办”的框框，离大队只有几步远，就是下不去，有些教师口里也说要搞教育革命，但一上课就复旧。正因为这样，我认为侯振民、王庆余两同志的革命建议很好，必须开展对刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的批判，使一切愿意革命的教师在思想上来一个彻底转变，才能恭恭敬敬地接受贫下中农的领导，才能不折不扣地按照贫下中农的要求去培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，才能使自己成为一个受贫下中农热烈欢迎的革命教师。　　　　　　红楚天
