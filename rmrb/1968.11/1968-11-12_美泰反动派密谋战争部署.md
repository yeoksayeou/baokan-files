U.S. imperialism has recently instructed its puppet regime in Thailand to accelerate military deployments to serve its policies of aggression and war. According to reports from Thai newspapers, Deputy Prime Minister Pote Sarasin and Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman were recently summoned to the United States. They held a series of talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy, and former U.S. commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland on the so-called "situation in Southeast Asia and Vietnam."

According to the Thai war criminal "commander" Chaloem Prawat who was recently recalled from Saigon to Bangkok, U.S. commander in Vietnam Creighton Abrams had requested the Thanom regime to further increase its troops in Vietnam. Thanom, the puppet regime's prime minister, recently boasted that Thailand has formulated a plan to reorganize its three military services and decided to allocate 500 million baht annually to improve the "combat effectiveness" of the armed forces.
