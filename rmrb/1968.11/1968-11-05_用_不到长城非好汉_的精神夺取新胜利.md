The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great and decisive victories. In the new revolutionary situation, Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, pointing out the direction for our continued advance to victory.

Reviewing the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in the Ningxia region, it is fully proven: "This great proletarian cultural revolution is completely necessary and extremely timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." The agents of Liu Shaoqi in Ningxia, such as Yang Jingren and Ma Yuhuai, carried out all sorts of evil deeds to implement their black master's intention of restoring capitalism. They were extremely afraid of and hostile to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, using every means to resist and sabotage the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. In the fields of politics, economy, and culture, they crazily promoted Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to drag the broad masses of laboring people back into the dark old society. They recruited traitors, formed cliques, and ruthlessly suppressed revolutionary masses, creating horrifying political frame-up cases. Their crimes are numerous and cannot be fully listed. If we do not overthrow them, Ningxia will change color, and we will suffer twice. At this critical juncture, our beloved Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great proletarian cultural revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses of Ningxia and the broad revolutionary masses seized power from the handful of capitalist roaders like Yang and Ma, removing them from their positions. However, this group of cunning and vicious class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, used both rightist and ultra-leftist (in form leftist but actually rightist) counter-revolutionary tactics, repeatedly launching fierce counterattacks. During the "February Countercurrent," they engaged in counter-seizure of power. After the support troops entered Ningxia, they again stirred up the evil wind of rehabilitating the "February Countercurrent," directing their attacks at the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and the People's Liberation Army. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Autonomous Region, they gathered traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and ghosts and monsters, forming black cliques, stirring up trouble, and attempting to overthrow the new revolutionary government and seize back their lost "paradise." In the sharp, complex, and intense struggle of subversion and anti-subversion, restoration and anti-restoration, the working class of Ningxia stood up, leading the revolutionary masses of the entire region to fight against the class enemies head-on, smashing their fierce counterattacks, and defending the great achievements of the great proletarian cultural revolution in Ningxia.

Through more than two years of the great proletarian cultural revolution, we have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is extremely wise and correct. Closely following Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and closely following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we are invincible. We must firmly hold power for the proletariat and use it well, carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a true hero," and strive to complete all the combat tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenum and seize the comprehensive victory of the cultural revolution!

    用“不到长城非好汉”的精神夺取新胜利
    由我们的伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。在新的革命形势下，毛主席又亲自主持召开了党的八届扩大的十二中全会，给我们指出了继续前进的胜利方向。
    回顾宁夏地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，充分证明：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”刘少奇在宁夏的代理人杨静仁、马玉槐等一小撮走资派，为了贯彻其黑主子的复辟资本主义意图，干尽了坏事。他们极端害怕和仇视战无不胜的毛泽东思想，千方百计抵制和破坏毛泽东思想的大普及、大传播；他们在政治、经济、文化等各个领域里疯狂推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，妄图把广大劳动人民拉回到黑暗的旧社会；他们招降纳叛，结党营私，疯狂地镇压革命群众，制造了骇人听闻的政治陷害案。他们的罪恶累累，罄竹难书。不把他们打倒，宁夏就要变颜色，我们就要吃二遍苦。在这重要关头，敬爱的毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，宁夏无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一举夺了杨、马等一小撮走资派的权，罢了他们的官。但是，这伙阴险、毒辣的阶级敌人，不甘心失败，他们交替使用右的和极“左”即形“左”实右的反革命两手，不断发起疯狂反扑。“二月逆流”中，他们大搞反夺权，支左部队进驻宁夏后，他们又大煽为“二月逆流”翻案的妖风，矛头直指以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部和人民解放军。自治区革命委员会成立后，他们又网罗叛徒、特务、反革命分子和牛鬼蛇神，拼凑黑班子，兴风作浪，妄图颠覆新生的革命政权，夺回他们失去的“天堂”。在尖锐、复杂、激烈的颠覆和反颠覆、复辟和反复辟的阶级搏斗中，宁夏工人阶级挺身而出，带领全区广大革命群众，同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了他们的猖狂反扑，捍卫了宁夏无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    通过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，我们更加深刻地体会到，毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，无比英明，无比正确。紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，就无往而不胜。我们一定要为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，发扬“不到长城非好汉”的彻底革命精神，为全面完成十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
