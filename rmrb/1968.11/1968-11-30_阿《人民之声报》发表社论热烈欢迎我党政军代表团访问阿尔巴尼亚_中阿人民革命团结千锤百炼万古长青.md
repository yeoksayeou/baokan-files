The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on November 28 titled "To Our Dear Friends from Great People's China, We Extend Warm Revolutionary Greetings." The editorial warmly welcomes the visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to Albania.

The editorial states that in these joyous and happy days, amidst the festive atmosphere of November 28 and 29, the representatives of the fraternal Chinese people have come among us. The visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation is a major event in the friendly relations and comprehensive brotherly ties between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, between our two parties, governments, and armies.

The editorial says that the recent visit of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Beqir Balluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, and Minister of Defense, to the People's Republic of China, and the visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, to our country, are further evidence of the strengthening of the fighting friendship and comprehensive brotherly cooperation between our two peoples. This friendship and unity have been tempered and strengthened in the storms of revolutionary struggle. This friendship and unity will last forever. This friendship and unity are based on the invincible Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and their creators are our two glorious parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial says that our fighting friendship, our revolutionary unity, is a great driving force and source of inspiration for our two peoples, but imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are terrified of it. The friendship and comprehensive cooperation between our two peoples are a shining example of genuine internationalist relations, embodying the lofty principles of Leninism of equality and brotherly unity.

The editorial says that as the closest comrades-in-arms, comrades, and true brothers of the Chinese people, the Albanian people are immensely happy about the brilliant victories achieved by People's China in the construction of socialism and in the various fronts of the socialist revolution. We sincerely congratulate the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and the decisive victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The editorial says that over the past two years, the essence of the fierce struggle between the two lines in China has been the question of power, the question of who holds the leadership of the Party and the state—whether it is in the hands of Marxists or in the hands of revisionists. In this fierce class struggle, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses composed of Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals have supported Mao Zedong Thought and, through unyielding struggle, have defended Mao Zedong Thought. They have exposed and thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, the mad and dangerous enemy of the Party and the people of China, and the faithful servant of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction. This marks the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism over revisionism and capitalism. This is not only a victory of historic significance for China's destiny but also a victory of historic significance for the revolutionary and socialist cause of the whole world. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the dreams of the enemies of socialism to repeat in China the tragedy of the betrayal of the Party and state leadership by the Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union completely collapse.

The editorial says that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the brilliant achievements in revolution and production, have made the People's Republic of China even stronger and have kept it forever red. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, great China today is a strong bastion of socialism, a strong base for world revolution, the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and a fighter standing at the forefront of the struggle against the hegemonic plans of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "Especially in the present situation, the existence of a powerful, revolutionary People's Republic of China, the indomitable great Communist Party of China, which is faithful to Marxism-Leninism, and its outstanding leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great fortune for the people of the world, for the freedom of the world, for world peace, for Marxism-Leninism, and for the future of socialism."

The editorial says that the Albanian people are genuinely delighted by the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people and by the bright prospects opened up for People's China by the historic resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Our people are proud to have more than 700 million Chinese people as such loyal friends.

The editorial concludes by saying that the friendship and revolutionary unity between our two peoples, parties, governments, and armies are becoming stronger day by day. The visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to our country will make new and important contributions to further tempering the fighting brotherly friendship between our two peoples.

The Albanian "Unity" and "Warrior" newspapers also published editorials on November 28, warmly welcoming the visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to Albania.

    阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈欢迎我党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚
    中阿人民革命团结千锤百炼万古长青
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十八日发表题为《向来自伟大的人民中国的亲爱的朋友致以热烈的革命敬礼》的社论，热烈欢迎中国党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚。
    社论说，在这欢乐和愉快的日子里，在十一月二十八日和二十九日伟大节日的气氛中，兄弟的中国人民的代表来到了我们中间。中国党政军代表团的这次访问，是阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间，我们两党、两国政府和两国军队之间的友好关系和全面的兄弟联系方面的一件重大的事。
    社论说，由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团最近访问中华人民共和国和由中国共产党中央委员、中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团这次访问我国，是我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊和全面的兄弟合作不断加强的又一明证，是我们的革命团结的又一表现。我们两国人民的这种友谊和团结是在革命斗争的大风大浪中得到了加强，经受了锤炼的。这种友谊和团结将万古长青。这种友谊和团结是建立在无往而不胜的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础之上的，它的缔造者是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首和以毛泽东同志为首的我们两个光荣的党。
    社论说，我们的战斗友谊，我们的革命团结，对我们两国人民来说，是巨大的动力和鼓舞的源泉，但帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派却对此怕得要死。我们两国人民之间的友谊和全面合作是真正的国际主义的真诚关系的光辉榜样，这种友谊和合作体现了列宁主义的平等和兄弟团结的崇高原则。
    社论说，作为兄弟的中国人民的最亲密的战友、同志和真正的兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，为人民中国在社会主义建设和社会主义革命各条战线上所取得的辉煌胜利感到无比的高兴，衷心祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的具有历史意义的决定性胜利，衷心祝贺毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想取得的决定性胜利。社论说，两年来，在中国进行的两条道路的激烈斗争的实质是政权问题，是党和国家的领导权掌握在谁的手中的问题——是掌握在马克思主义者手中，还是掌握在修正主义者手中的问题。在这场激烈的阶级搏斗中，由中国工人、农民、战士和革命知识分子组成的亿万革命群众，拥护毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，并通过坚持不懈的斗争，捍卫了毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想。他们揭露并彻底粉碎了以中国党的和人民的疯狂而危险的敌人、帝修反的忠实奴仆刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部。这标志着无产阶级专政和社会主义战胜了修正主义和资本主义。这不仅是对中国命运具有历史意义的胜利，而且是对全世界革命和社会主义事业具有历史意义的胜利。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使社会主义的敌人梦想在中国重演在苏联发生的赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团篡夺党和国家领导权的悲剧的阴谋彻底破灭了。
    社论说，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，革命和生产方面的辉煌成就，已经使得中华人民共和国比以前更加强大了，并使她永远保持鲜红的颜色。毛泽东同志领导的伟大中国，今天是社会主义的强大堡垒，是世界革命的强大基地，是马克思列宁主义的旗手，是站在反对美帝国主义和苏联修正主义主宰世界的称霸计划的斗争前列的战士。恩维尔·霍查同志曾经说过：“特别是在当前的形势下，有强大的、革命的中华人民共和国，战斗的、忠实于马克思列宁主义的不屈不挠的伟大的中国共产党及其卓越的领袖毛泽东同志，这是世界人民及其自由、世界和平、马克思列宁主义和社会主义的前途的巨大幸运。”
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民取得的辉煌的胜利，对中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的历史性决议展现在人民中国面前的光辉前景感到由衷的喜悦。我国人民为有七亿多中国人民这样的忠实朋友而感到自豪。
    社论最后说，我们两国人民、两党、两国政府和两国军队之间的友谊和革命团结正在日益加强。中国党政军代表团访问我国，将为进一步锤炼两国人民的这种战斗的兄弟友谊作出新的重要的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》和《战士报》也在二十八日分别发表社论，热烈欢迎中国党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚。
