The Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation was invited by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, and the Albanian government, to participate in the celebrations of the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation and to conduct a friendly visit.

Not long ago, when the whole country was red with revolutionary fervor and the working class took the stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the time when the people of our country were filled with victorious enthusiasm and celebrated the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense, visited China. Now, at a time when Albania's revolutionary movement is achieving one victory after another, when the people of the whole country are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm to welcome the 24th anniversary of the country's liberation, the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation has arrived in Albania, the great socialist beacon of Europe.

At 3:15 PM, the special plane carrying the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, loaded with the deep friendship and goodwill of the Chinese people towards the Albanian comrades, slowly descended onto the Tirana airport. When Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation stepped out of the plane, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and waved to the welcoming crowd, the entire scene immediately erupted in thunderous applause and roaring slogans. Comrades Shehu, Kaba, and Balluku stepped forward to shake hands and embrace Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation warmly. A group of young pioneers presented flowers to the Chinese guests.

The orchestra played the national anthems of the two countries.

They also walked among the crowd, taking photos with them to commemorate the moment.

Later, Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation, accompanied by Comrade Shehu and others, boarded the car and headed to the city of Tirana, receiving a warm welcome from tens of thousands of people along the way.

Along the way to the city, wherever the delegation went, there was a scene of celebration. In the suburbs, large numbers of workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers of the people's army, government officials, and students spontaneously gathered to welcome the delegation. The workers of the Vora Brick and Tile Factory also blew their horns to pay tribute to the Chinese guests.

In the city, people lined the sidewalks and stood on the balconies of buildings, waving the national flags of the two countries, colorful ribbons, and flowers, enthusiastically welcoming the Chinese comrades, and continuously shouting slogans such as "Enver-Mao," "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship." In the central square of Skanderbeg, the welcoming scene reached its climax.
