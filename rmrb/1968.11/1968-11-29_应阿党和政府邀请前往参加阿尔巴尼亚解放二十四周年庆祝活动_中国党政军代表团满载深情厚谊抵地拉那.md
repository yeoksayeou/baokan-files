New China News Agency, Tirana, November 27: The Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, arrived in Tirana by special plane on the afternoon of November 27. The heroic people of the Albanian capital, with boundless revolutionary fervor, gave the warmest and most enthusiastic welcome to the Chinese comrades sent by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically cheering the new developments in the revolutionary friendship between the two parties, two peoples, two governments, and two armies of Albania and China in their common struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and in their common cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation was invited by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, and the Albanian government, to participate in the celebrations of the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation and to conduct a friendly visit.

Diplomatic envoys from several countries to Albania also came to the airport to welcome the delegation.

Not long ago, when the whole country was red with revolutionary fervor and the working class took the stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the time when the people of our country were filled with victorious enthusiasm and celebrated the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense, visited China. Now, at a time when Albania's revolutionary movement is achieving one victory after another, when the people of the whole country are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm to welcome the 24th anniversary of the country's liberation, the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation has arrived in Albania, the great socialist beacon of Europe. This fully embodies the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two peoples, two governments, and two armies of Albania and China in their common struggle, mutual support, mutual encouragement, and mutual learning.

Today, the working people, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers and officers of the people's army, and other people of the Albanian capital, who are advancing bravely in socialist revolution and socialist construction, are filled with joy and excitement. They held up giant portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and the national flags of the two countries. They waved red flags, colorful banners, and flowers from all directions, surging towards the Tirana airport and the main streets of the city to welcome the Chinese comrades.

The airport building in Tirana was adorned with giant portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. Below the portraits, a red banner read: "Long Live Albanian-Chinese Friendship." The national flags of the two countries fluttered in the wind, surrounded by countless red flags.

At 3:15 PM, the special plane carrying the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, loaded with the deep friendship and goodwill of the Chinese people towards the Albanian comrades, slowly descended onto the Tirana airport. When Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation stepped out of the plane, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and waved to the welcoming crowd, the entire scene immediately erupted in thunderous applause and roaring slogans. Comrades Shehu, Kaba, and Balluku stepped forward to shake hands and embrace Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation warmly. A group of young pioneers presented flowers to the Chinese guests.

The orchestra played the national anthems of the two countries. Comrade Huang Yongsheng, accompanied by Comrades Shehu and Balluku, reviewed the Albanian People's Army honor guard and circled the field to greet the welcoming crowd enthusiastically. They also walked among the crowd, taking photos with them to commemorate the moment.

Later, Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation, accompanied by Comrade Shehu and others, boarded the car and headed to the city of Tirana, receiving a warm welcome from tens of thousands of people along the way.

Today, the city of Tirana was adorned with festive decorations. The Cultural Palace in the city center was adorned with giant portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman Mao Zedong. The main buildings were flying the national flags of the two countries. Banners written in Albanian and Chinese were hung along the streets, reading: "Welcome, dear guests!" "Long live the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between Albania and China!" "The people of all countries will win, socialism will win, imperialism and revisionism will be defeated!" "Carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end!"

Along the way to the city, wherever the delegation went, there was a scene of celebration. In the suburbs, large numbers of workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers of the people's army, government officials, and students spontaneously gathered to welcome the delegation. The workers of the Vora Brick and Tile Factory also blew their horns to pay tribute to the Chinese guests.

In the city, people lined the sidewalks and stood on the balconies of buildings, waving the national flags of the two countries, colorful ribbons, and flowers, enthusiastically welcoming the Chinese comrades, and continuously shouting slogans such as "Enver-Mao," "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship." In the central square of Skanderbeg, the welcoming scene reached its climax. A group of Albanian young women in national costumes presented flowers to Comrade Huang Yongsheng and other members of the delegation. A group of performing artists played folk music, enthusiastically cheering the revolutionary friendship between Albania and China. Students of the Tirana Music School sang the folk song "Great Albanian-Chinese Friendship."

The entire city of Tirana was filled with boundless joy.
