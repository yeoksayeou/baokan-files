The Red Light Primary School in Jianbing Brigade, Sanchang People's Commune, Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, was established in 1951. In 1958, two junior high school classes were added, making a total of 430 teachers and students. Over the past decade, this school was controlled by bourgeois intellectuals who vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They peddled the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism and did everything they could to exclude the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from attending school, practicing dictatorship over the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After the Cultural Revolution, initiated by Mao Zedong, blazed across the country in 1966, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianbing Brigade responded to Chairman Mao's call to "revolutionize education." They seized control of the Red Light Primary School from the bourgeois intellectuals and directly managed the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants recognized that the school platform is a crucial battleground for the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over the next generation. This battleground must be occupied by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They formed an Educational Revolution Committee, which, while re-educating revolutionary teachers to promote their ideological revolution, dispatched representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants with experience in the three great revolutionary movements to form a lecture team. They stepped onto the school platform with heads held high, firmly grasping this important battleground in their own hands.

The poor and lower-middle peasants seizing control of educational power is a fierce class struggle. A small group of class enemies saw the poor and lower-middle peasants ascending the platform and spread rumors, saying, "'Mud-legged' people teaching, they will make the children wild and corrupt them." They attempted to drive the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team out of the school. "How easy is it for an ant to shake a tree?" The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately exposed the class enemies' plot and struggled against a particularly vicious, unrepentant rich peasant. Lecture team member Jiao Guangshou pointed at this person and exposed him, saying, "You ruling class have controlled the schools for thousands of years. In today's socialist society under proletarian dictatorship, do you still want to control our schools? That's a daydream! We must kick you out of the schools and, following Chairman Mao's instructions, forge a new path for the educational revolution." The poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team also faced obstruction from old habits and forces. Some conservative-minded individuals looked down on and disapproved of the poor and lower-middle peasants teaching. They had a "three counts and three does not count" mentality: only the original teachers teaching on the platform counted as teaching; students studying in the classroom counted as teaching; learning from old textbooks counted as teaching. In response to these old habits and forces, the poor and lower-middle peasants organized a special critique, exposing the past education system's detachment from proletarian politics, workers and peasants, and reality. They denounced the crimes of the bourgeois educational line, making everyone realize that the "three detachments" were the black goods of revisionism promoted by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, aimed at cultivating talent for capitalist restoration. Now that the poor and lower-middle peasants have ascended the school platform, revolutionary teachers and students participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, placing Chairman Mao's works as the main course. This aligns with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and fundamentally ensures that our descendants will not produce revisionists. Many commune members said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao."

In the struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team continued to develop and grow. It has increased from the original eleven members to twenty-two. The lecture team is led by the Educational Revolution Committee of the poor and lower-middle peasants in a unified manner. They set up seven courses: Chairman Mao's works, class struggle, military and political training, production labor, agricultural machinery, revolutionary arts, and cultural knowledge. Each course has a preparation group that teaches according to the students' level. Activists in studying Mao Zedong Thought share their experiences in applying Chairman Mao's works; demobilized soldiers teach the PLA's four firsts, three-eight work style, and three major disciplines and eight points for attention, and are responsible for military training; poor and lower-middle peasants who suffered greatly in the old society teach village and family histories; "local technicians" teach agricultural production knowledge; agricultural machinery workers teach agricultural machinery technology; semi-farmer, semi-medical health workers teach treatment methods for common local diseases; veterinarians teach livestock management and disease prevention. The members of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team do not leave their jobs; they teach according to the scheduled course timetable. When determining teaching materials and preparing lessons, they first seek the opinions of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, pooling wisdom to make the teaching content highlight Mao Zedong Thought and closely connect with reality.

Facts have proven that the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team ascending the school platform and occupying the educational battleground in rural schools is excellent. Compared to the past teaching by bourgeois intellectuals, it demonstrates unparalleled superiority.

First, the members of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team have unlimited love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They deeply feel from their struggle practice that following Chairman Mao is victory. Therefore, after ascending the school platform, they vigorously promote the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the past, this school had no quotations from Chairman Mao, no courses on Chairman Mao's works, and only instilled the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into the students. After the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team ascended the platform, this situation was completely changed. They made studying Chairman Mao's works the main course, insisting on the system of reporting in the morning and summing up in the evening; they also organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes and active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought lectures attended by poor and lower-middle peasants. "Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good student of Chairman Mao" has become the action guideline for every student. The students' spiritual appearance has been completely renewed.

Second, every member of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team has a bloody and tearful family history. They best understand what class is and what class exploitation and oppression are. They have unlimited love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and intense hatred for the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. In the past, when bourgeois intellectuals controlled the school, they advocated "knowledge, interest, and science," obscuring class struggle and promoting class reconciliation. The poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team often teaches students about family history, village history, and class struggle history; they take students to martyrs' graves to teach revolutionary struggle history, hold class struggle exhibits, and organize students to visit the poor and ask about hardships. They also take students out of the school to join the poor and lower-middle peasants in carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Through intense class education and revolutionary criticism and struggle, the proletarian consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students have significantly improved. Many students wrote in their diaries, "Never forget class bitterness, remember blood debts, follow Chairman Mao, and always revolutionize."

Third, the members of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team are the most experienced warriors. They can best combine theory with practice, making their lectures lively and interesting. Students understand, remember, and can apply what they learn. Some teachers originally thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures would lower the quality of teaching. Now they realize that they taught dead books, while the poor and lower-middle peasants teach living knowledge. They are determined to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, transform their worldview, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, contribute to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. One teacher used to teach agricultural machinery, lecturing from books to books, explaining what a "water pump" and a "cylinder" are, without even seeing them himself. After teaching for two years, not a single student could operate the machinery. Lecture team member Wang Junyi took the students to the machinery room, explaining both theoretical knowledge and demonstrating practical operations. The students quickly mastered the operational process. Now, the brigade's processing factory's production is managed by twenty-four students taking turns. The poor and lower-middle peasants are very happy to see their children being able to operate machinery, saying, "In the past, we learned a lot of useless things. Today, we learn something useful. We welcome such a school."

Fourth, the members of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team brought their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, selfless dedication, and good style of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments into the school, setting an example for the broad teachers and students. The lecture team members, with mud on their bodies, rolled with the students, blending their thoughts and feelings. The students told them everything, and the teachers and students were harmonious. A student from a poor peasant family, Wang Junsheng, was considered an uneducable student under the revisionist educational line. Lecture team member Ding Chongkuan actively approached him, had many heart-to-heart talks with him, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and labored together, quickly transforming him into an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire brigade. This student said, "Bourgeois intellectuals led me astray, and the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team guided me onto the right path." The best style of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team members is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with lightning speed. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going down to labor were issued, the lecture team organized teachers and students to study them overnight and printed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to be sent to the poor and lower-middle peasants' homes with drums and gongs. The entire day's courses were about studying this latest instruction, organizing revolutionary teachers and students to discuss and plan actions, and rehearsing artistic performances to propagate and perform in the fields and courtyards.

Fifth, after the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team ascended the school platform, they cleaned up the class ranks among the teachers and reorganized the existing teacher team. In the entire school, one-third of the teachers were sent down to labor for tempering; one-third listened to the poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures, helping with knowledge courses and compiling local teaching materials; and one-third, under the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lecture team, taught cultural knowledge courses. Over the past two years, this school has insisted on the system of teachers regularly participating in collective production labor. When teachers had ideological problems, the lecture team members would have heart-to-heart talks with them, helping them actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, pointing out their shortcomings, and indicating the direction of their efforts. Because of this, the teachers' spiritual appearance has also changed significantly, advancing a step on the road of integrating with the workers and peasants.

　　贫下中农登上学校讲台显示无比优越性
　　——江苏省东台县三仓公社尖兵大队贫下中农讲课团登上学校讲台的调查
    江苏省东台县三仓公社尖兵大队的红光小学，是在一九五一年建立的，一九五八年又增设了两个初中班，共有师生四百三十人。十几年来，这个学校被资产阶级知识分子所控制，他们竭力推行刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼的反革命修正主义教育路线，大肆贩卖封、资、修黑货，竭力排斥贫下中农子女入学，对贫下中农实行专政。
    一九六六年，无产阶级文化大革命熊熊烈火点燃以后，尖兵大队的贫下中农响应毛主席发出的“教育要革命”的伟大战斗号召，从资产阶级知识分子手中夺回了学校领导大权，直接管理了红光小学。贫下中农认识到学校讲台是资产阶级和无产阶级争夺下一代的重要阵地。这个阵地，必须由贫下中农来占领。贫下中农组成了教育革命委员会，在对学校中的革命教师进行再教育，促进他们思想革命化的同时，派出有三大革命运动实践经验的贫下中农代表，组成讲课团，昂首阔步走上学校讲台，把这个重要阵地牢牢地掌握在自己的手里。
    贫下中农掌握教育大权，这是一场激烈的阶级斗争。一小撮阶级敌人看到贫下中农走上讲台，便造谣说：“‘泥腿子’当教师，把孩子教野了，教坏了。”他们妄图把贫下中农讲课团轰出学校。“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。用毛泽东思想武装的贫下中农立即识破阶级敌人的阴谋，揪斗了一个跳得最凶、没有改造好的富农分子。贫下中农讲课团成员焦广寿指着这个家伙揭露道：“你们剥削阶级统治学校几千年了，在今天无产阶级专政的社会主义社会里，你们还想控制我们的学校吗？这是白日做梦！我们就是要把你们从学校里踢出去，就是要按照毛主席指示，闯出一条教育革命的新路来。”贫下中农讲课团走上讲台，也遇到了旧习惯势力的阻挠。一些思想比较保守的人对贫下中农上课瞧不起，看不惯。他们心目中有“三算三不算”：原来的教师上讲台才算上课，贫下中农上讲台不算上课；学生在教室里念书才算上课，参加阶级斗争、田间劳动不算上课；学生学老书本才算上课，学毛主席语录、报刊社论、文章就不算上课。针对这一些旧习惯势力，贫下中农组织了专题批判，大摆了过去学校教育脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农、脱离实际的危害，控诉了资产阶级教育路线的罪恶，使大家认识到“三脱离”是叛徒刘少奇搞的修正主义的黑货，是为资本主义复辟培养人材的。现在贫下中农走上学校讲台，革命师生参加阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，把毛主席著作列为主课，是符合毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的，是从根本上保证我们的后代不出修正主义的。许多社员说：“毛主席为我们指明的革命大道，我们贫下中农是走定了。”
    在斗争中，贫下中农讲课团得到了不断发展和壮大。现在，已由原来的十一人增加到二十二人。贫下中农讲课团由贫下中农教育革命委员会实行一元化领导。他们设置了七门课程：毛主席著作、阶级斗争、军政训练、生产劳动、农业机械、革命文艺、文化知识。各门课程分别组成备课小组，根据学生的程度来讲授。学习毛泽东思想积极分子讲自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会，介绍贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想的好人好事；复员军人讲解放军的四个第一、三八作风、三大纪律八项注意，并负责军训；在旧社会苦大仇深的贫下中农讲村史、家史；“土技术员”讲农业生产知识；农业机械工讲农业机械技术；半农半医卫生员讲本地常见疾病的治疗方法；兽医讲牲畜管理和畜病防治。贫下中农讲课团的成员都不脱产，他们按照排好的课程表到校讲课。他们在确定教材和备课时，首先征求广大贫下中农的意见，集思广益，使教学内容突出毛泽东思想，紧密联系实际。
    事实证明，贫下中农讲课团登上学校讲台，占领农村学校的教育阵地就是好得很，同过去资产阶级知识分子教学对比，显示了无比的优越性。
    一，贫下中农讲课团的成员，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚，他们从斗争实践中深深体会到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。因此，他们登上学校讲台以后，大抓无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。过去，这所学校没有一条毛主席语录，没有一堂毛主席著作课，向学生灌输的尽是封、资、修的毒素。贫下中农讲课团登上学校讲台后，完全改变了这种情况。他们把学习毛主席著作列为最主要的课程，坚持早请示，晚汇报的制度；还组织有贫下中农参加的毛泽东思想学习班和活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生”已成为每个学生的行动准则。学生的精神面貌焕然一新。
    二，贫下中农讲课团的每一个成员，都有一部血泪斑斑的家史。他们最懂得什么是阶级，什么是阶级剥削和压迫。他们无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，切齿痛恨叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。过去资产阶级知识分子统治学校的时候，提倡什么“知识性、趣味性、科学性”，抹煞阶级斗争，宣扬阶级调和。贫下中农讲课团经常对学生讲家史、村史、阶级斗争史；把学生带到烈士墓前讲革命斗争史，举办阶级斗争实物展览会，组织学生访贫问苦。他们还把学生带出学校和贫下中农一起开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。贫下中农通过狠抓阶级教育，开展革命大批判，革命师生的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。很多学生在自己日记本上写下了“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，紧跟毛主席，永远干革命”的誓言。
    三，贫下中农讲课团的成员，都是最有实践经验的战士，他们讲课最能把理论和实际相结合，讲得生动活泼，学生听得懂，记得牢，用得上。有些教师原来认为贫下中农讲课会降低教学质量，现在也认识到自己教的是死书，贫下中农教的才是活知识，决心拜贫下中农为师，向贫下中农学习，改造自己的世界观，和贫下中农一起，为培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人作出贡献。有一个教师过去教农业机械，从书本讲到书本，什么叫“水泵”，什么叫“汽缸”，连他自己都没有看过。教了二年，没有一个学生会开机器。贫下中农讲课团成员王均义，把学生带到机器房，既讲理论知识，又作实际操作示范，学生很快掌握了技术操作过程。现在大队加工厂的生产，已由二十四个学生轮流包干。贫下中农看到自己子女能开机器非常高兴，他们说：“过去学了一大堆，一点儿没有用，今天学一样用一样，这样的学校我们最欢迎。”
    四，贫下中农讲课团的成员，把无限忠于毛主席的好思想，一心为公的好品质，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的好作风，带进了学校，为广大师生树立了学习榜样。讲课团的成员带着一身泥巴，和学生滚在一处，思想感情交融在一起，学生有什么话都对他们讲，师生之间融洽无间。有个贫农家庭出身的学生王均生，在修正主义教育路线统治下，被认为是一个不可教育的学生。讲课团成员丁崇宽主动接近他，多次找他谈心，同他一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，使他很快转变过来，成了全大队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。这个学生说：“资产阶级知识分子把我带上了邪路，贫下中农讲课团把我引上了正道。”贫下中农讲课团成员的最好作风，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示。毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示一发表，讲课团连夜组织师生学习，并把毛主席的最新指示刻印出来，敲锣打鼓送到贫下中农家里。第二天整个课程就是学习这条最新指示，组织革命师生讨论，订出了行动规划，并赶排文艺节目，深入田头、场头宣传演出。
    五，贫下中农讲课团登上学校讲台后，在教师中清理阶级队伍的基础上，对原有教师队伍进行了整顿。全校教师，三分之一下放劳动锻炼；三分之一听贫下中农讲课，帮助做知识课辅导和整理乡土教材；还有三分之一在贫下中农讲课团的领导下讲文化知识课。两年来，这个学校坚持了教师定期参加集体生产劳动的制度。教师有什么思想问题，讲课团成员就找他们谈心，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，指出他们身上的缺点，给他们指出努力方向。由于这样，教师的精神面貌也发生了很大变化，在与工农群众相结合的道路上前进了一步。
