Two million Japanese students jointly launch a massive demonstration

Student struggles deliver a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, completely foiling the conspiracy of the Gombun faction

	BEIJING, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) - According to the Oriental News Agency, 20,000 Japanese university students gathered at the campus of Tokyo University on November 22 to launch a massive struggle against the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the decadent bourgeois educational system. This struggle dealt a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and completely foiled the conspiracy of the Gombun revisionist faction to sabotage the student struggle, greatly boosting the anti-U.S. spirit of the Japanese people.

	This struggle was jointly initiated by students from Tokyo University and Nihon University. Students from other universities in Tokyo and regions such as Kyushu, Kansai, and Hokkaido also sent representatives to Tokyo University to join the struggle. This action marked the beginning of the unification of student struggles that had been scattered across various regions since this spring, pushing the Japanese student movement to a new high.

	Early in the morning of November 22, the campus of Tokyo University resonated with the majestic melody of "The Internationale." Thousands of students, wearing helmets and carrying sticks, marched through the campus, chanting slogans such as "Smash the bourgeois educational system," "Occupy and blockade the various departments of Tokyo University," and "Smash the revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party led by Gombun." At 10 a.m., the demonstrators charged towards the Tokyo University library building, which was occupied by the school authorities and the henchmen of the Gombun faction. They quickly seized the building. The Gombun faction's plan to hold a so-called "anti-violence rally" in front of this building was completely foiled by the students' revolutionary action. Subsequently, the patriotic students hung red flags at the school gate and completely took control of the university.

	Meanwhile, 5,000 students from Nihon University, who had been on strike for more than 160 days, first held a rally in their own campus to thoroughly expose and condemn the crimes committed by Koda Jujirou, the chairman of the board of trustees of Nihon University, who colluded with the pro-U.S. Prime Minister Sato Eisaku to rule the university. Then, they joined students from Chuo University, Meiji University, and many other universities to form a procession of several thousand people. They bravely broke through the obstruction of a large number of armed police and marched into Tokyo University, where they were warmly welcomed by the students in the campus.

	Red flags were flying on the roof of the Yasuda Auditorium of Tokyo University. The 20,000 university students, full of fighting spirit, held a mass rally in the square in front of the auditorium. Among the many red flags waving in the wind, several had the words "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." Student representatives from Tokyo University, Nihon University, and many other universities took the stage one after another to express their determination to carry on the struggle to oppose the reactionary and decadent bourgeois educational system, smash the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," and dismantle U.S. military bases. They unanimously pointed out that the current era is a great new era of world revolution, and the Japanese people should launch a great struggle worthy of this new era. To defeat imperialism and reactionaries around the world, it is necessary to thoroughly smash revisionism.

	The Japanese Communist Party, which has degenerated into a lackey of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, was unwilling to accept its defeat. It secretly sent a group of lackeys into the campus, shouting slogans such as "Let us unite on the basis of opposing violence" and "Negotiate with the school authorities to solve the problem," in an attempt to collude with the reactionary school authorities to sabotage the student struggle. However, in the face of the students' magnificent struggle, their conspiracy failed, and they had to flee in disarray.

	The rally continued until late into the night. The entire campus was filled with a revolutionary fighting atmosphere.

    爱国学生团结战斗把学生运动推向新高潮
    两万日本学生联合展开声势浩大示威
    学生斗争给美日反动派以有力打击，使宫本集团破坏阴谋彻底破产
    新华社二十三日讯  据东方通讯社报道：两万名日本大学生二十二日聚集在东京大学校园内，展开声势浩大的斗争，反对美日反动派的反动统治和腐朽的资产阶级教育制度。这次斗争给了美日反动派以有力的打击，使宫本修正主义集团企图破坏学生斗争的阴谋彻底破产，大大地鼓舞了日本人民的反美斗志。
    这次斗争是由东京大学和日本大学的学生联合发起的，东京的其他大学和九州、关西、北海道等地区的大学也都派代表到东京大学会师。这一行动，使今春以来在各地分散进行的学生斗争开始走向联合，把日本学生运动推向新的高潮。
    二十二日清晨，东京大学校园内响起了雄壮的《国际歌》歌声。几千名头戴帽盔、手拿棍棒的学生在校园内游行，高呼“粉碎资产阶级教育制度”、“占领和封锁东京大学的各部门”、“粉碎日共宫本修正主义集团”等口号。十点钟，示威学生向被大学当局和宫本集团的爪牙占据的东京大学图书馆大楼冲击，并且很快地占领了这所大楼。宫本集团原定在这所大楼前召开所谓“反对暴力大会”的卑鄙阴谋由于学生的这一革命行动而遭到彻底破产。随后，爱国学生在学校大门前挂起了红旗，并完全控制了这所大学。
    与此同时，已经坚持罢课一百六十多天的日本大学学生五千人，首先在他们自己的校园里举行集会，彻底揭露和谴责同亲美首相佐藤荣作勾结起来统治日本大学的学校董事长古田重二良犯下的罪行。然后，他们同中央大学、明治大学等许多大学的学生汇合起来，组成一支数千人的游行队伍，冲破大批武装警察的阻拦，勇敢地开进东京大学，在暴风雨般的掌声中同东京大学校园内的学生胜利会师。
    东京大学的安田讲堂的屋顶上飘扬着红旗。两万名大学生斗志昂扬地在讲堂前面的广场上举行群众大会。在迎风招展的许多红旗中，有几面红旗上写着“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”。东京大学、日本大学等许多大学的学生代表相继发表讲话，表示决心把反对反动腐朽的资产阶级教育制度、粉碎日美“安全条约”和拆除美军基地的斗争进行到底。他们一致强调指出，现在是处于伟大的世界革命新时代，日本人民应当展开同这个新时代相称的伟大斗争。而为了战胜帝国主义和各国反动派，就必须彻底粉碎修正主义。
    已经堕落成为美日反动派的走狗的日共宫本修正主义集团，不甘心于他们的失败，又偷偷摸摸地向校内派出一批娄罗，叫喊什么“让我们在反对暴力的基础上团结起来”，“同大学当局举行谈判来解决问题”，阴谋勾结反动的大学当局破坏学生斗争。但是，在日本大学生的轰轰烈烈的斗争面前，他们的阴谋没有得逞，并且不得不狼狈溜走了。
    大会一直开到深夜。整个校园内充满了革命的战斗气氛。
