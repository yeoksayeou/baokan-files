The suggestion to transfer public primary schools to the brigade level is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, aligns with the direction of socialist education, and meets the urgent needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Similarly, this suggestion also represents the demands of revolutionary teachers and students.

Based on my personal experience, I feel that transferring public primary schools to the brigade level has significant meaning. Rural education is an important battlefield for the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to compete for successors. I am one who has been deeply poisoned by revisionist education. When I was in primary school, the teacher was a landlord. In the teaching process, he fiercely promoted Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "studying to become an official," leading us down the "intellectual first" white specialist path. This landlord also took me as a key cultivation object, praising how "intelligent" I was and how promising my future was, and so on. He made me cram books and did not allow me to participate in labor. My father is an old poor peasant and a Communist Party member. At that time, he responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to take the collective path and set up the first mutual aid team in our village. The mutual aid team of a few poor peasants had few hands and many difficulties, so my father asked me to work for the mutual aid team. However, I was led astray by bourgeois education and did not want to participate in labor. Moreover, I had the idea of being "superior to others," demanding food and clothing from my family, becoming lazy and greedy.

Because the school implemented the revisionist educational system, the poor and lower-middle peasants had no right to intervene. My father often vented his anger, saying, "This book, we won't read it anymore!" Later, my father told me about the bitter history of our ancestors being oppressed by the landlord class, and about his own painful experiences of working for the landlord at the age of ten, going hungry in winter, wearing rags, and working barefoot in the ice and snow for the landlord. But once in school, the teacher would instill the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist black goods of "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior" into me, corrupting my soul. I remember once I picked up a pair of "pliers" from the production team. I thought: if I hand it in, I will definitely be praised and rewarded. With such a selfish idea, I handed it in, but I received neither praise nor reward, which made me very dissatisfied. Now I realize that this was completely due to the poisoning of bourgeois ideology and the result of bourgeois intellectuals controlling the school.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals controlling our schools can no longer continue." The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has swept the great traitor, great internal traitor, and great swindler Liu Shaoqi into the dustbin of history. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by Liu Shaoqi, the good son and grandson of the landlord class, and shout loudly for the poor and lower-middle peasants to occupy the battlefield of rural education, seizing back all the cultural power that has been in the hands of the bourgeoisie.

### 建议代表了革命师生的要求

　　建议代表了革命师生的要求
    我认为将公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，是符合毛泽东思想的，是符合社会主义教育事业发展方向的，是符合贫下中农迫切愿望的。同样，这个建议也代表了革命师生的要求。
    根据我亲身的经历，感到公办小学下放到大队来办，有重大意义。农村教育是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺接班人的重要阵地。我就是受修正主义教育毒害很深的一个。我上小学的时候，教师是一个地主分子。他在教学过程中，疯狂地推行刘少奇的“读书做官论”等反革命修正主义谬论，让我们走“智育第一”的白专道路。这个地主分子还把我当做重点培养对象，宣扬我如何如何“聪明”，多么有前途，等等。他教我死啃书本，不许我参加劳动。我父亲是一个老贫农、共产党员，那时，他响应伟大领袖毛主席走集体化道路的伟大号召，在我村办起第一个互助组。几户贫农的互助组人手少、困难很多，我父亲就叫我给互助组干活。但是，我被资产阶级教育引上了邪路，就是不愿参加劳动。而且，还因为我有“高人一等”的思想，向家里要吃，要穿，变得又懒又馋。
    因为学校贯彻的是修正主义教育体制，贫下中农无权过问。我父亲经常大发脾气说：“这书，咱不念了！”后来我父亲给我讲我家祖祖辈辈受地主阶级欺压的惨痛历史，讲他十几岁就给地主扛活，冬天食不饱肚，衣不遮体，光着脚在冰天雪地里为地主干活的痛苦经历。可是一到学校，教师又向我灌输“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的封、资、修黑货，来腐蚀我的灵魂。我记得有一次，我拾到生产队的一把“老虎钳”，我想：如果把它交公，一定会得到表扬和奖励。我带着这样的名利思想把它交公后，一没受表扬，二没有奖励，对此我很不满意。现在我认识到，这完全是受了资产阶级思想的毒害，完全是资产阶级知识分子统治学校的结果。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇扫进了历史的垃圾堆。我们必须继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底砸烂地主阶级的孝子贤孙刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，为贫下中农占领农村教育阵地大喊大叫，把掌握在资产阶级手中的文权统统夺回来。
