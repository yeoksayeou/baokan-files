The Indian reactionary government, under the direction of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is hastening to create "two Chinas"

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note of protest to the Indian Embassy in China on November 12, strongly condemning the Indian reactionary government's actions, under the direction of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to hasten the creation of "two Chinas" and its wanton anti-China crimes.

The note pointed out that recently, the Indian government openly allowed a delegation led by Tao Yong from the Chiang Kai-shek clique to India to participate in activities commemorating the 100th anniversary of Gandhi's birth. Indian officials also received and hosted this delegation from the Chiang clique. The Chinese Embassy in India had, on September 30, lodged a serious protest with the Indian government over its following of the U.S. in openly creating "two Chinas." However, the Indian government not only did not immediately stop these actions hostile to the Chinese people but instead intensified them. On October 3, the Indian government's Minister of Information and Broadcasting, K.K. Shah, met with the delegation from the Chiang clique and accepted a gift. On October 10, members of the Chiang clique held a reception in Delhi, attended by the mayor of Delhi, several members of the Indian National Congress, and others. The Indian national anthem and the anthem of the Chiang clique were played at the event. The Indian government also allowed the Chiang clique member Tao Yong to deliver a speech in Delhi, viciously attacking the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

The note said that this is another serious incident of the Indian reactionary government, under the direction of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, hastening to create "two Chinas" and wantonly engaging in anti-China activities. It is a serious provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people express great indignation over this and strongly protest to the Indian government.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note concluded by saying that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a political corpse long since rejected by the Chinese people. The Indian government insists on aligning with this corpse and serving the U.S. imperialist plot to create "two Chinas," persisting in being an enemy of the Chinese people, and will not end up well.

　　印度反动政府在美帝、苏修指使下加紧制造“两个中国”
　　我外交部向印驻华使馆提出强烈抗议
　　印度政府和蒋匪帮加紧勾结坚持与中国人民为敌决不会有好下场
    新华社十二日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十二日照会印度驻华大使馆，强烈抗议印度反动政府在美帝、苏修指使下，加紧制造“两个中国”，猖狂反华的罪行。
    照会指出，最近印度政府公然允许蒋介石匪帮派出一个以陶镕为首的“代表团”到印度参加纪念甘地诞辰一百周年活动，印度官员还接见和宴请了这个蒋匪帮“代表团”。对印度政府追随美帝，公开制造“两个中国”，中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源曾于九月三十日向印度政府提出严正抗议。但是，印度政府不但不立即停止这种敌视中国人民的行为，反而变本加厉一意孤行。十月三日印度政府宣传与广播部长Ｋ·Ｋ·沙阿会见了蒋匪帮“代表团”并接受了赠礼。十月十日蒋匪帮分子在德里举行了招待会，印度德里市长、国大党议员等多人出席捧场，会上奏了印度国歌和蒋匪帮歌。印度政府还让蒋匪分子陶镕在德里公开发表讲话，恶毒攻击中国文化大革命。
    照会说，这是印度反动政府在美帝、苏修指使下，加紧制造“两个中国”，猖狂反华的又一严重事件，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并向印度政府提出强烈抗议。
    我外交部的照会最后说，蒋介石匪帮是早已被中国人民唾弃的政治僵尸，印度政府硬要与这具僵尸为伍，为美帝制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋效劳，坚持与中国人民为敌，是决不会有什么好下场的。
