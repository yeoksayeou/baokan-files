The Revolutionary Committee of the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory in Wuhan, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, has taken the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as a great driving force. It has vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle at the squad level, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." This has further raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses, pushing the factory's work of cleaning up the class ranks to develop in depth.

After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory quickly launched a campaign to study, publicize, implement, and carry out the communiqué. The factory revolutionary committee and the stationed PLA agreed that to quickly turn the spirit of the communiqué into a great force to promote the revolution and production, it is necessary to respond to the call of the communiqué: "Continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and sweep away the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other major capitalist-roaders within the Party." Use revolutionary criticism and struggle to promote all work, and make the ongoing work of cleaning up the class ranks continuously develop in depth.

Members of the factory revolutionary committee and the stationed PLA all went deep into the squads, working and studying the communiqué with the workers, researching the new trends, new problems, and new characteristics of class struggle within the factory, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle. They targeted the active thoughts of some squads that believed "our squad has no bad people, just focus on production," and together with the revolutionary masses, used the method of "three remembrances, three reflections, and three criticisms" to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." That is: remember the bitterness of the old society, think of the sweetness of the new society, and criticize Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism; remember the history of class struggle in the factory over the past sixty years, think of the various sabotage activities of a small handful of class enemies in the factory, and criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle"; remember Chairman Mao's leadership in the heroic struggle of the working class, think of the position and role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and criticize Liu Shaoqi's ugly face of betraying the revolution, selling out the workers' movement, and surrendering to the enemy in Wuhan in 1927. The revolutionary masses used this method to open up the battlefield of revolutionary criticism and struggle, and continuously held meetings to struggle against class enemies. In the revolutionary criticism and struggle, many old workers reviewed the history of class struggle in the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, severely exposed and criticized the factory's capitalist-roaders following Liu Shaoqi, surrendering and recruiting traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and attempting to restore capitalism. Through criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the class struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses was greatly enhanced, and their consciousness of class struggle and two-line struggle was raised. Now, the revolutionary masses are full of fighting spirit, and after work, they still get together to gather materials and investigate enemy situations. Everyone does investigations and research. Old workers Li Sichuan and Zhou Ke'an of the power car workshop tube group, in order to help other squads gather materials and investigate enemy situations, often worked tirelessly, and even at midnight, they went to various residential areas to visit and connect, contributing to the work of cleaning up the class ranks. Under the great encouragement of the communiqué, the revolutionary masses, taking the squad as a unit, pressed on with their victories and dug out another batch of deeply hidden bad elements.

With the arrival of the high tide of criticism and struggle, a small handful of class enemies faced imminent doom, and they spread rumors and desperately resisted. A bourgeois reactionary "technical authority" said: "You can criticize me, but I still have my technology." His words ignited the indignation of the revolutionary masses. Various squads immediately launched a campaign to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of "experts managing the factory." The workers said, Liu Shaoqi, the running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing the factory." Under the protection of this line, these bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" controlled the technical power in the factory and practiced bourgeois dictatorship over us workers. The world was won under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and the factory was built by us. We are the natural masters of the factory, and we have the ability to manage the factory and lead everything. They set aside the reactionary "technical authorities" and launched a mass technical innovation and technological revolution movement. On the third day after the communiqué was issued, they successfully opened a new assembly line for vehicles, continuously raising production targets. With great indignation, the masses dragged the reactionary "technical authorities" to the scene for on-site criticism, smashing the plot of a small handful of class enemies to sabotage the work of cleaning up the class ranks, greatly boosting the morale of the working class, and greatly dampening the arrogance of a small handful of class enemies.

Due to the various squads carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and other revisionist fallacies, the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses was mobilized. The entire factory's revolution was carried out vigorously, and the work of cleaning up the class ranks continuously developed in depth. The struggle, criticism, and transformation movement presented a new high tide.

　　狠批叛徒刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”等反革命修正主义谬论
　　江岸车辆厂清理阶级队伍工作向纵深发展
    新华社武汉十九日电　武汉市江岸车辆厂革命委员会在驻厂人民解放军的帮助下，以党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为巨大动力，狠抓班组的革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，进一步提高了广大群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了工厂清理阶级队伍的工作不断向纵深发展。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，江岸车辆厂迅速掀起了学习、宣传、贯彻、落实公报的热潮。厂革委会和驻厂解放军一致认为，要使公报的精神迅速变成推动革命和生产的巨大力量，必须响应公报的号召：“继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。”以革命大批判推动各项工作，使当前正在进行的清理阶级队伍的工作不断向纵深发展。
    厂革委会委员和驻厂解放军都深入到班组中去，和工人一块参加劳动，一块学习公报、贯彻公报，一块研究厂内阶级斗争的新动向、新问题、新特点，一块开展革命大批判。他们针对有的班组认为“我们班组没有坏人，搞好生产就行了”的活思想，和广大革命职工一起采用“三忆、三想、三批判”的方法，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。即：忆旧社会的苦，想新社会的甜，批判刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行；忆建厂六十年来的阶级斗争史，想厂里一小撮阶级敌人的种种破坏活动，批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；忆毛主席领导工人阶级英勇斗争史，想工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中的地位和作用，批判刘少奇一九二七年在武汉叛变革命、出卖工人运动、投降敌人的丑恶嘴脸。广大革命职工采取这种办法，摆开了革命大批判的战场，连续召开了揪斗阶级敌人的大会。在革命大批判中，许多老工人回顾了江岸车辆厂的阶级斗争史，狠揭猛批厂里走资派跟着刘少奇的屁股转，招降纳叛、重用叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。通过批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大大增强了广大革命职工的阶级斗争观念，提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。现在，广大革命职工斗志昂扬，下班后还在一块碰材料，摸敌情，人人做调查研究。动力车间管子小组老工人李四川、周克安等，为了帮助别的班组调查材料，摸清敌情，经常废寝忘食，深更半夜还到各个家属区走访串连，为清理阶级队伍的工作贡献力量。广大革命职工在公报的巨大鼓舞下，以班组为单位，乘胜追击，又挖出一批隐藏得很深的坏人。
    随着大批判高潮的到来，一小撮阶级敌人面临灭顶之灾，他们散布谣言，拚命顽抗。一个资产阶级反动技术“权威”说：“你们批我可以，但我还有技术。”他的话激起了广大革命职工胸中的万丈怒火。各班组立即掀起了狠批刘少奇“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义谬论的热潮。广大工人说，帝、修、反的走狗刘少奇，极力推行“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线。在这条路线的保护下，这些资产阶级反动技术“权威”控制了厂里的技术大权，对我们工人实行资产阶级专政。天下是毛主席领导我们打下来的，工厂是我们修建的，我们是工厂的当然主人，我们有能力管好工厂，有能力领导一切。他们抛开反动技术“权威”，开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，在公报发表的第三天，就成功地开辟了一条新的总装车辆的流水线，使生产指标不断上升。广大职工怀着无比愤怒的心情，把反动技术“权威”揪到现场，进行现场批判，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏清理阶级队伍工作的阴谋，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的威风。
    由于各班组开展了对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”等修正主义谬论的大批判，调动了广大革命职工的积极性，全厂革命搞得轰轰烈烈，清理阶级队伍工作不断向纵深发展，斗、批、改运动出现了新高潮。
