The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly boosted the morale of the broad revolutionary masses and greatly dispelled the arrogance of class enemies. Upon hearing that the plenary session unanimously decided to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his Party and state positions, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade were overjoyed. Everyone, young and old, rushed to tell each other, and all unanimously expressed their firm support for the wise decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The vast majority of the poor and lower-middle peasants in our production brigade came from all over the country to beg for food in the old society, and every family had a "book of sufferings." It was our great leader Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering and enabled us to live the happy life we have today. We have boundless love, loyalty, admiration, and respect for Chairman Mao. Indeed, the heavens and the earth are not as great as Chairman Mao's grace. Parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. However, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi is more vicious than a wolf and more poisonous than a scorpion. In the old society, the sky belonged to the landlords, and the land belonged to the landlords. We poor and lower-middle peasants had no shelter above and no place to stand below. We were forced to work to death for those landlords who drank human blood and ate human flesh, but in the end, we still had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. Many people worked themselves sick, but had no money to see a doctor. Yet, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi advocated "exploitation has merit" and vigorously promoted the black goods of "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms," attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside and make us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. We will not agree to this, not even a thousand times, not even ten thousand times.

To educate our children to never forget the bitterness of class struggle and to remember the blood debt, many poor and lower-middle peasants with deep grievances have used their own bitter family histories in the old society to denounce the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi. The revolutionary criticism has been carried out vigorously.

Last month, when I conveyed to the poor and lower-middle peasants my participation in the National Day celebration and saw our great leader Chairman Mao, who is in very good health and cares deeply about us poor and lower-middle peasants, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were so excited that they shouted in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times! However, a small handful of class enemies were trying to plead for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in secret. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were so angry that they almost burst their lungs and immediately dragged out this small handful of class enemies for criticism and struggle. The practice of class struggle tells us that although the big villain Liu Shaoqi has been exposed, the exploiting class and their agents are not willing to accept their doom and are still waiting for an opportunity to sabotage. We must stay alert and smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemies.

    大灭了阶级敌人的威风
    陕西省革命委员会副主任
    户县沧游公社双永大队党支部书记  王凤琴
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，大长了广大革命群众的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。我们队里的贫下中农，一听到全会一致通过决议：把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，真是高兴万分，不论大人小孩纷纷奔走相告，大家
  一致表示，坚决拥护党的八届扩大的十二中全会的英明决议。
    我们生产大队绝大多数贫下中农，都是在旧社会从山南海北逃荒要饭来的，家家都有一本“苦情账”。是伟大领袖毛主席把我们从苦海里救了出来，过上了今天的幸福生活。我们对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限崇拜，无限敬仰，真是天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。可是，刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼比豺狼还恶，比蝎子还毒。旧社会，天是地主的天，地是地主的地，我们贫下中农上无片瓦遮身，下无半分立足之地，成年累月被迫给那些喝人血吃人肉的地主没死没活地干，到头来还是吃没吃，穿没穿，许多人累了一身病，也没钱医治。可是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇却说什么“剥削有功”，大肆推销“三自一包”“四大自由”等黑货，妄图在农村复辟资本主义，使我们贫下中农受二遍苦。我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    为了教育我们的子女永远不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，许多苦大仇深的老贫农都用自己在旧社会的苦难家史，对刘少奇的滔天罪行进行了愤怒的控诉，革命大批判开展得轰轰烈烈。
    上个月，当我向贫下中农传达我参加今年国庆观礼见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席，他老人家身体非常非常健康，非常关心我们贫下中农的时候，广大贫下中农都激动得连声高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！可是，一小撮阶级敌人却在背地里妄图为刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼鸣冤叫屈。广大贫下中农肺都要气炸了，立即把这一小撮阶级敌人揪了出来，进行了批判斗争。阶级斗争的实践告诉我们，刘少奇这个大坏蛋虽然被揪了出来，但是剥削阶级及其代理人，决不甘心于他们的灭亡，还在伺机进行破坏，我们必须提高警惕，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。
