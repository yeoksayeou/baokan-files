One afternoon, Zhang Lishan, a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers stationed at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, returned from a meeting and saw a student sitting there with a worried look, as if he had a lot on his mind. Old Zhang stopped to talk to him. Before he could even squat down, the student didn't say a word, patted his buttocks, and left.

Zhang Lishan thought to himself as he walked, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force.' Educating the younger generation to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao is a sacred duty that the working class cannot shirk. I must help this student untie his knot of thoughts with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao." He decided to find this student again to talk.

What was this student's name? Which department was he from? He didn't know. What should he do? Chairman Mao said, "If you can't solve a problem, then investigate the current situation and history of that problem! Once you have thoroughly investigated it, you will have a way to solve it." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, after multiple investigations, Old Zhang finally learned that this student was from the Geography Department. During the Cultural Revolution, he had done some wrong things and said some wrong words. As the struggle, criticism, and transformation deepened, he feared criticism and carried a heavy burden of thoughts.

Old Zhang took the initiative to visit the student's dormitory. After going three times, before Old Zhang could even open his mouth, the student would avoid him from afar. On the fourth visit, although he didn't run away, after saying a few words, he excused himself with some business and left. Facing this situation, Old Zhang did not lose heart. He recalled Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Thought reform is a long-term, patient, and detailed job. You can't expect to change someone's consciousness, formed over decades of life, with just a few classes or meetings." He decided to persist and continue his work.

How to open his mind and help him put down his burden of thoughts? Old Zhang recalled an incident: In their factory, there was a young worker who was said to have severe bourgeois factionalism and was "a person who would never turn around." However, after pairing up with the stationed PLA soldier, Comrade Guo, in a "pair of loyals," under Comrade Guo's patient help, he quickly overcame his bourgeois factionalism and became a revolutionary fighter in the struggle against the enemy. Comrade Guo, when sharing his experience in ideological work, said: "To uproot a tree, you must dig out its roots. To help people, you must help their hearts. To help people's hearts, you must use one key to open one lock, and solve active thoughts with targeted measures." Old Zhang was determined to learn this experience from the PLA comrades.

On his seventh visit to the student, Old Zhang first studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him, repeatedly explaining that the fundamental purpose of the workers' propaganda team entering the school was to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, help with the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Cultural Revolution in the school to the end. Because the work was done on his knot of thoughts, it dispelled his concerns, and the student's attitude changed significantly. He further actively exposed his active thoughts. Under Old Zhang's help, he quickly raised his awareness, correctly recognized his mistakes, put down his burden of thoughts, and actively participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation revolutionary movement. He excitedly said: "The working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most concerned about us Red Guards. In the future, I will definitely take the working class as an example and accept the working class's re-education well."

　　帮人要帮心
    一天下午，驻广州中山大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队的张立山同志开会回来，看见一位同学愁眉苦脸地坐在那里，好象有一肚子心事。老张停下脚步，想和他谈谈。刚蹲下去，这位同学一句话没说，拍了拍屁股，就走了。
    张立山同志边走边想，毛主席教导我们：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”教育青年一代无限忠于毛主席，这是我们工人阶级义不容辞的神圣职责。我要怀着对毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，帮助这位同学解开思想疙瘩。他决心再找这位同学谈心。
    这位同学叫什么名字？是哪个系的？都不知道。怎么办呢？毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”遵照毛主席的教导，经过多次调查，老张终于了解到这位同学是地理系的学生。文化大革命中，他做过一些错事，说过一些错话，斗、批、改深入开展以后，他怕受批评，背上了思想包袱。
    老张主动上门，找到这个同学的宿舍。连续去三次，还没等老张开口，他就远远避开了。第四次他虽然没有跑掉，话没说两句，就借口有事，又走了。面对这种情况，老张没有泄气，他想起了毛主席的伟大教导：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”于是，他决心坚持下去，不断地工作。
    怎样打开他的心窍，帮助他放下思想包袱？老张想起了这样一件事：他们工厂有一位年青工人，大家都说他资产阶级派性比较严重，是“永远也转不过弯来的人”。可是，他和驻厂解放军郭班长结成
  “一对忠”以后，在郭班长的耐心帮助下，很快就克服了资产阶级派性，成了对敌斗争的革命闯将。郭班长在介绍做思想工作的经验时说：“刨树要挖根，帮人要帮心。要做到帮人帮心，必须用一把钥匙开一把锁，有的放矢地解决活思想。”老张下决心，一定要把解放军同志的经验学到手。老张第七次找到这位同学，首先同他一起学习了毛主席的最新指示，反复说明工人宣传队进校的根本目的是落实毛主席的伟大战略部署，宣传毛泽东思想，帮助搞好斗、批、改，把学校的文化大革命进行到底。因为工作做到了他的思想疙瘩上，解除了他的顾虑，这位同学的态度有了很大转变，进一步主动暴露了自己的活思想。在老张同志的帮助下，很快提高了觉悟，正确认识了自己的错误，放下了思想包袱，积极参加到学校的斗、批、改的革命运动中去。他激动地说：“工人阶级对毛主席最忠，对我们红卫兵小将最关心。今后我一定以工人阶级为榜样，很好地接受工人阶级的再教育。”
