Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, has been vigorously carrying out revolutionary criticism and has launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. Revolution has driven production, and since the beginning of this year, coal production in this mine has been rising month by month and quarter by quarter. After exceeding the state plan in the third quarter, the mine also completed its production task for October two days ahead of schedule.

Since the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels in Huainan Coal Mine, broad revolutionary workers, in conjunction with the problems existing in the mine's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They have realized that to turn the mine into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly sweep away the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, it is necessary to focus on revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary committees at all levels have mobilized the masses to quickly launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism. In the underground tunnels, workshops, teams, offices, and staff residential areas, revolutionary criticism battles have been set up everywhere. Revolutionary criticism has promoted the development of the work of cleaning up class ranks, exposing a number of deeply hidden class enemies.

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Huainan Coal Mine have also combined revolutionary criticism with the reform of unreasonable regulations and systems. During the revolutionary criticism, broad revolutionary workers have broken through various unreasonable regulations and systems and immediately put forward a series of proposals for thorough reform. The revolutionary workers of Dongfeng Mine have carried forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, boldly reforming some production regulations and systems. This has greatly improved labor efficiency, making coal production in the entire mine rise step by step.

At present, the broad revolutionary workers of Huainan Coal Mine, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are continuing to focus on revolutionary criticism, promoting the further development of production.

　　淮南煤矿提前完成十月份生产任务
    安徽淮南煤矿广大工人在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，狠抓革命大批判，掀起了波澜壮阔的斗、批、改高潮。革命推动了生产，今年以来这个矿的煤炭生产月月上升，季季上升。在第三季度超额完成国家计划之后，十月份又提前两天完成了生产任务。
    淮南煤矿各级革命委员会普遍建立以后，广大革命职工结合本矿文化大革命中和生产中存在的问题，反复学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，认识到要把矿井办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，彻底肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的影响，必须狠抓革命大批判。各级革委会深入发动群众，很快掀起了一个革命大批判的高潮。在井下巷道、车间班组、机关科室以及职工住宅区，到处摆开了大批判的战场。革命大批判推动了清理阶级队伍工作的开展，挖出了一批隐藏很深的阶级敌人。
    淮南煤矿各级革命委员会还把革命大批判和改革不合理的规章制度结合起来。在革命大批判中，广大革命职工大破各种不合理的规章制度，并且立即提出了一系列彻底改革的倡议。东风矿广大革命职工，发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，大胆地对生产上的一些规章制度进行了改革。这样，大大提高了劳动效率，使全矿煤炭生产节节上升。
    目前，淮南煤矿广大革命职工，在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，正继续狠抓革命大批判，推动生产进一步发展。
