Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "A writer or artist of talent must go among the people, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and must go to the very heart of the struggle." Chairman Mao's great directive has pointed out the fundamental path for the ideological transformation of literary and artistic workers.

However, our enemy, the poor and lower-middle peasants, the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi, openly sings a different tune. He fiercely opposes the integration of literary and artistic workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and opposes the ideological transformation of literary and artistic workers. He constantly advocates that literary and artistic workers going to the countryside can "specially arrange a few cars, set up beds and stoves on them, and live in those cars..." If we follow Liu Shaoqi's black words and let literary and artistic workers go to the countryside in cars to "experience life," eating and sleeping in a car that is isolated from workers, peasants, and soldiers, then they would not experience even a bit of the life of poor and lower-middle peasants, nor would they feel even a bit of the sentiments of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Liu Shaoqi, through his agents in the literary and artistic circles like Zhou Yang, promoted a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. He also led the advocacy of the fallacy of "reforming on the car." Therefore, some literary and artistic workers were deeply poisoned. A few years ago, some actors came to our countryside, often traveling by car, eating in restaurants, sleeping in rooms, and evaluating performances by ticket sales. When they spoke, they acted superior. On stage, they acted softly, and when they held a hoe, they did not look like a peasant; when they held a hammer, they did not look like a worker; when they held a gun, they did not look like a soldier. During the day, they only rested, sitting together and chatting, never meeting with us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and felt both angry and sad. Some poor and lower-middle peasants said: "These people have not been among us poor and lower-middle peasants for a long time, they only know how to sing and dance. They truly eat white rice, but do they know that we poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society had wild vegetables for a meal? They wear clothes that are green and blue, warm and comfortable, but do they know that we poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society wore patched clothes, a single garment for the whole winter?"

There were a few so-called "famous actors" who came to the countryside and arrived at our village. As soon as they saw an old poor peasant carrying manure, they covered their noses with a white handkerchief. When they went to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, they stood far away from the door and did not enter; when they went to the fields, they pretended to work a little and that was it. Some even did not know how to hold a hoe. They did not have the sentiments of poor and lower-middle peasants, so how could they perform well for poor and lower-middle peasants? According to the actors trained by Liu Shaoqi from "the car," they could only be actors who do not engage in physical labor. They are not ordinary laborers serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, but "superior people" who stand above us workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, poor and lower-middle peasants reflected: "Such actors have nothing to talk about with us poor and lower-middle peasants, how can they perform poor and lower-middle peasants well?"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Students from old schools, most or the majority, can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some people have made inventions and creations, but they need to be under the correct line leadership, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers."

However, the old fox Liu Shaoqi, in order to realize his ambition to usurp the party, usurp the government, and usurp the military, has long advocated the fallacy of "reforming on the car," attempting to cultivate literary and artistic workers into bourgeois spiritual aristocrats who are detached from workers, peasants, and soldiers, detached from labor, and detached from reality, to serve him in restoring capitalism.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has politically sentenced the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi to death. We poor and lower-middle peasants must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly purge all the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism. Let Liu Shaoqi's fallacy of "reforming on the car" go to hell!

    如此“下乡”法
    ——斥刘少奇的一个谬论
    上海市川沙县顾路公社　顾农文
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。毛主席的这一伟大指示，给文艺工作者的思想改造指出了根本途径。
    可是，我们贫下中农的死敌，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，却明目张胆地唱反调。他疯狂地反对文艺工作者和工农兵相结合，反对文艺工作者的思想改造，他一个劲地鼓吹什么文艺家下乡去可以“专门搞几部汽车，那上面架起铺来，架起灶来，就住在那个汽车上……”如果按照刘少奇的黑话去做，让文艺工作者坐着汽车下乡去“体验生活”，连吃饭、睡觉也躲在那辆与工农兵隔绝的汽车里，那就根本体验不到半点贫下中农的生活，感受不到半点贫下中农的感情。
    刘少奇通过他在文艺界的代理人周扬之流，推行了一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，他还带头鼓吹“在汽车上”“改造”的谬论，因此，有些文艺工作者中毒很深。前几年，有些演员到我们农村来，往往是出进乘车子，吃饭上馆子，睡觉论房子，演出效果讲票子，讲起话来摆架子。台上演戏，甩起手来软绵绵，拿起锄头不象农民，拿起榔头不象工人，拿起枪杆不象解放军。白天他们只管休息，坐在一起谈笑风生，根本不与我们贫下中农照面。我们贫下中农看了又气愤，又痛心。有些贫下中农讲：“这些人长期不到我伲贫下中农中来，只晓得唱唱跳跳。他们真是吃着雪花白米饭，哪晓得我伲贫下中农在旧社会里红花野菜当一餐？他们是衣裳穿得三青四绿，暖烘烘，哪晓得我伲贫下中农在旧社会里穿的是补钉打补钉，一件单衫过一冬？”
    曾经有几个所谓“名演员”下乡，来到我们村头，一见挑粪的老贫农走过，就用白绢头蒙住鼻子。到贫下中农家，远远地站在门口，不进去；到田头，装装样子稍微动一下就算劳动。有的甚至连锄头也不知怎样拿。他们根本没有贫下中农的感情，怎么能为贫下中农演好戏？按照刘少奇从“汽车上”培养出来的演员，只能是一些四体不勤的演员。他们根本不是为工农兵服务的普通劳动者，而是高踞于我们工农兵头上的“上等人”。因此贫下中农反映说：“这样的演员跟我伲贫下中农无话可谈，他们演贫下中农怎么可能演得象呢？”
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”
    可是，刘少奇这只老狐狸，为了实现其篡党、篡政、篡军的野心，长期以来，极力鼓吹“在汽车上”“改造”的谬论，企图把文艺工作者培养成为脱离工农兵，脱离劳动，脱离实际的资产阶级的精神贵族，为他复辟资本主义效劳。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报，在政治上宣判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的死刑。我们贫下中农，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义的一切流毒。让刘少奇鼓吹的坐“汽车”下乡“改造”的谬论见鬼去吧！
