    The story of a cook on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at the Tanggula Mountain station is widely circulated: Station Commander Lyu Chuanshuang cured the headache of the new soldier Jiao Yibing.

    Jiao Yibing, a high school graduate, originally named Jiao Luvua. He had always dreamed of becoming a glorious soldier of the People's Liberation Army, so he changed his name to "Yibing." When he put on his new green military uniform and realized his dream of becoming a soldier, he was overjoyed. He thought, "To protect Chairman Mao, stand by a big gun, or hold a submachine gun, guard and stand watch for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line... hey, how exciting!" However, he was later assigned to the Tanggula Mountain station on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an altitude of over 5,000 meters, to be a cook. Jiao Yibing's mind was racing: A high school student, a high school student, traveled thousands of miles, became a cook—no future! The air on Tanggula Mountain is thin, and everyone who first arrives experiences some degree of high-altitude sickness. Jiao Yibing was constantly thinking about problems, so his headache was worse than others.

    Commander Lyu is a keen and perceptive person. He noticed every move Jiao Yibing made and kept it in his heart. He decided to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to untie the knots in Jiao Yibing's mind.

    Commander Lyu sat down with Jiao Yibing and repeatedly studied the Quotations from Chairman Mao and the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Chairman Mao taught us, "Our army is a people's army. It fights for the people's interests and serves the people wholeheartedly." Comparing this with Chairman Mao's teachings, he explained in detail to Jiao Yibing the shining images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the old fool moving mountains, introduced the heroic deeds of border guards protecting Chairman Mao and the country's borders, and also shared his own and the old comrades' experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and serving the passing personnel wholeheartedly. He said, "We join the army to protect Chairman Mao and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This station is our battlefield for protecting Chairman Mao. All our work is a concrete action to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao tells us to serve the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly.' Whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao depends on whether we can be red at the station and serve the passing personnel wholeheartedly."

    Commander Lyu's words struck Jiao Yibing's heart. After a brief pause, Commander Lyu said meaningfully, "Some people, although they are also 'revolutionaries,' do not understand the true meaning of revolution. They are happy when revolutionary work suits their wishes, and unhappy when it does not. Such people have actually been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the fusion of public and private interests.'" Jiao Yibing could no longer hold back. He stood up excitedly and said, "Previously, my headache was because I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi and fell for his tricks. From now on, I will definitely study and apply Mao Zedong Thought earnestly, thoroughly reform my worldview, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a cook on Tanggula Mountain for the rest of my life."

    Once the mind is clear, everything becomes clear. Below Tanggula Mountain, the ice and snow in the river had just melted, and the weather was still cold. To improve the lives of passing personnel, the station leadership decided to mobilize everyone to go fishing in the river. Commander Lyu and Jiao Yibing braved the cold wind and walked along the rugged mountain path to the riverbank. Commander Lyu took off his cotton pants and jumped into the icy water. Jiao Yibing also jumped in without hesitation. He did not mind the pain of stones pricking his feet or the cold of the river water, and he kept reciting the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely, fearlessly, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He persisted in the fight.

    Now, Jiao Yibing is completely different from when he first arrived at the station. He decided to put down the airs of an intellectual, humbly learn from the old comrades at the station. In the harsh battles on the snowy plateau, he tempered his boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the People's Liberation Army, he cultivated himself into a true proletarian revolutionary soldier. In addition to completing his duties as a cook, he went wherever there was work and did whatever work was difficult. He said, "As long as the revolution needs me, I will work on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for the rest of my life."

　　高原上的炊事兵
    在青藏高原的唐古拉山兵站，传颂着这样一个故事：站长吕传銮把新战士焦一兵的头痛病治好了。
    焦一兵，高中文化程度，原名焦鲁娃。他从小就想当一名光荣的解放军战士，因此改名叫“一兵”。当他穿上了崭新的绿军装，实现了当一名解放军战士的愿望的时候，高兴极了。他想：“为了保卫毛主席，守在一门大炮旁，或者端上一挺冲锋枪，为毛主席的革命路线放哨、站岗……嘿，多带劲！”可是后来，他被分配到了青藏高原拔海五千多米的唐古拉山兵站，当了一名炊事员。焦一兵脑子直打转转：中学生，中学生，走了几千里，当个炊事兵——没出息！唐古拉山空气稀薄，人们初到这里，都有或轻或重的高山反应。焦一兵脑子里一直在想问题，所以他头痛比别人更重。
    吕站长是一个眼明心细的人，焦一兵的一举一动，都看在眼里，记在心里。他决心用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，解开焦一兵思想上的疙瘩。
    吕站长和焦一兵坐在一起，反复学习毛主席语录和“老三篇”。毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”对照着毛主席的教导，他给焦一兵详细讲解了张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象，介绍了边防战士保卫毛主席、保卫祖国边防的英雄事迹，还介绍了自己和站上的老同志活学活用毛泽东思想、全心全意为过往人员服务的体会。他说：“我们当兵，是为了保卫毛主席，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这兵站就是我们保卫毛主席的战场，各项工作都是我们捍卫毛主席革命路线的具体行动。毛主席叫我们‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务，我们对毛主席忠不忠，就看我们能不能红在兵站，能不能全心全意地为过往人员服务。”
    吕站长的话，句句都敲打在焦一兵的心上。稍停了停，吕站长又意味深长地说：“有的人，虽然也在‘革命’，但不懂得革命的真正含义，革命工作合他的心愿，就高兴，不合他的心愿，就不高兴。这种人，实际上就是中了刘少奇‘公私溶化论’的毒。”焦一兵听了，再也憋不住了，他站起来激动地说：“以前我所以头痛，就是因为中了刘少奇的毒，上了他的当。今后，我一定要好好地活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底改造世界观，听毛主席的话，在唐古拉山当一辈子炊事兵。”
    思想通了，一通百通。唐古拉山下的河沟里，冰雪刚刚消溶，天气依然寒冷。为了给过往人员改善生活，兵站领导决定发动大家下河捕鱼。吕站长和焦一兵迎着寒风，踏着崎岖的山路来到河边。吕站长脱掉棉裤跳进带有冰碴的水里。焦一兵也毫不犹豫地跟着跳了下去。他不顾石块扎脚痛，也不怕河水刺骨寒，默诵着伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一直坚持战斗。
    现在，焦一兵和刚到兵站的时候完全不同了。他决心放下知识分子的架子，虚心向兵站的老同志学习。在风雪高原的艰苦战斗中，锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心。在解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校里，把自己培养成真正的无产阶级革命战士。他除了完成炊事兵的本职工作外，那里有活到那里干，什么活艰苦干什么活。他说：“只要革命需要，我就在青藏高原干一辈子。”
