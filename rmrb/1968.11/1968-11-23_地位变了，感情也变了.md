	Status Changed, Feelings Changed

	The shift from a salary system to a work point system has transformed teachers from cadres into commune members. As our status changes, our thoughts and feelings will gradually shift as well. In teaching labor, having poor and lower-middle peasants evaluate our work points is akin to having them assess us.

	In the past, teachers spent long periods in the office, detached from labor and from the masses, unable to breathe in the fresh air of the masses' struggles, and with a significant distance from the masses' thoughts and feelings. For instance, in our school, which was previously publicly funded, teachers received state salaries. They were physically in the countryside but mentally not, rarely participating in production labor and showing little concern for agricultural production. Whether the crops suffered a disaster or not, they received their salaries and rations at the end of the month. This created a disconnect between teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants. This year, the school was transitioned to community management (i.e., brigade management), with brigade leaders taking on the role of revolutionary committee chairmen in the school. The school's work is now part of the brigade's agenda. Under the brigade's leadership, we no longer operate independently from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This has changed our feelings. We now understand that the grain we eat is earned through the sweat of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and our teaching authority comes from them. Everything we do must consider the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	As our thoughts and feelings change, we become more concerned with the production brigade's work. Before the frost this year, the brigade had a shortage of labor, and there was much farm work to be done. Seeing that the buckwheat and turnips were about to be affected by the frost, many teachers took the initiative to lead students and poor and lower-middle peasants to harvest the buckwheat and turnips, preventing the frost damage. Afterwards, poor peasant Old Cui said, "We like teachers like this."

    地位变了，感情也变了
    由工资制变成了工分制，教师就由干部变成了社员，地位变了，思想感情也就会逐渐发生变化。在教学劳动中，由贫下中农给评定工分，对我们教师来说，就是由贫下中农给我们作鉴定。
    过去教师长期呆在办公室，脱离劳动，脱离群众，呼吸不到群众斗争的新鲜空气，同群众的思想感情距离很大。比如我们学校，过去是公办，教师拿国家工资，他们身在农村，心不在农村，平时不参加生产劳动，不关心农业生产，不管它遭灾不遭灾，反正到月头就领工资、分口粮，这样一来，与贫下中农的感情就贴不到一块。今年，学校改为民办（即大队办），大队的负责人担任了学校里的革委会主任，学校的工作纳入了大队的议事日程。我们在大队的领导下，做什么事都不脱离贫下中农，这样，我们的感情就不一样了。我们明白了吃的粮食，都是贫下中农用汗珠换来的，我们的教育权力是贫下中农给的，我们做什么事都要想到贫下中农。
    思想感情变了，对生产队的生产也就关心起来了。今年上冻以前，队里劳力少，地里农活多，眼看着荞麦、蔓菁就要受冻了，许多老师都自觉地带领学生和贫下中农一起把荞麦、蔓菁收了回来，避免了冻灾。事后，贫农老崔四说，我们就喜欢这样的老师。
