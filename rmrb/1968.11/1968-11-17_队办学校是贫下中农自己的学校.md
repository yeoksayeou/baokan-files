	Editorial Comrades:

	The suggestions made by revolutionary teachers Shǒu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú from Shandong Province are completely in line with the direction of the rural educational revolution. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support this.

	Public primary schools being transferred to the production brigades to run allows us poor and lower-middle peasants to better grasp the power of education and run the schools according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Schools run by the production brigades are different from those run by the public. Schools run by the production brigades, we poor and lower-middle peasants always feel are our own schools, and we are willing to send our children to these schools. Everyone cares about every aspect of these schools and tries every means to run them well.

	Our Hongjin Brigade has a primary school. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants took over this school, renamed it the "May 7th" School, and added a junior middle school class. Now this school offers courses on studying Chairman Mao's works, class education, and collective labor, and has reformed the content of courses like language, arithmetic, and drawing. Winter vacation has been changed to a busy farming season vacation, and the length of the vacation is determined according to the grade level. We poor and lower-middle peasants happily say: "Such a school, the students it educates are to our liking, and are successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." This year when school started, many poor and lower-middle peasants beat drums and gongs to send their children to school. Now the number of students has increased from over eighty to over three hundred. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Mass-run schools are good, running them in the brigades is good, and poor and lower-middle peasants managing them is good."

　　队办学校是贫下中农自己的学校
　　编辑同志：
    山东省侯振民、王庆余两位革命教师的建议，完全符合农村教育革命的方向。我伲贫下中农坚决支持。
    公办小学下放到大队来办，我伲贫下中农可以更好地掌握教育大权，按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线来办学。大队办的学校和公办的学校就是不一样。大队办的学校，我伲贫下中农总感到是自己的学校，愿意把自己的子女送到学校去。大家对这种学校处处关心，事事关心，想方设法要把学校办好。
    我伲洪泾大队有一所小学，文化大革命中我伲贫下中农把这所学校管了起来，改名为“五·七”学校，还增添了初中班。现在这所学校开设了学习毛主席著作课、阶级教育课、集体劳动课，改革了语文、算术、图画等课程的内容，寒假改为农忙假，还根据年级高低来确定假期的长短。我伲贫下中农高兴地说：“这样的学校，教出来的学生最称我伲的心，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”今年开学，许多贫下中农都敲锣打鼓把自己的孩子送到学校上学。现在学生已从八十多人增加到了三百多人。广大贫下中农说：“民办学校好，办到大队好，贫下中农管理好。”
