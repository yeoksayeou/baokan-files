The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shangzhuzi Production Brigade have a habit of gathering every evening to listen to the radio.

One evening, as landlord Li Grandma and her entire family were sitting on the kang, intently listening to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and newspaper editorials, suddenly, there was a "click" and the radio went silent. Li Grandma quickly called her grandson Aijun to check what was wrong. Aijun took down the radio and inspected it; the speaker and the radio wire were both fine. Suddenly, Li Grandma seemed to have discovered the "secret" behind the radio going silent. She pulled Aijun, who was fiddling with the radio, close and whispered a few words in his ear. Aijun then grabbed a flashlight and rushed out the door.

It turned out that the radio wire leading to Li Grandma's house was connected to the radio wire of a rich peasant's house in the western courtyard. It was this rich peasant who had cut the radio wire. Little Aijun rushed into the rich peasant's house and shone the flashlight, only to see the villain hurriedly hiding the radio wire under the kang. Aijun, enraged, snatched the wire from him. The rich peasant rushed out, trying to grab the cut wire back from Aijun. The two struggled, alerting the masses in the eastern and western courtyards and the platoon leader of the supporting soldiers, Huo Wenbin. The platoon leader thought: This is a living teaching material for class education. He suggested holding an immediate criticism and struggle meeting.

At the meeting, Li Grandma angrily said: The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has always advocated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," attempting to make us relax our vigilance against class enemies so they can carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Today, it is even clearer that landlords and rich peasants are like onions under the eaves—dried leaves but the heart is alive. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Tell the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, you attempt to disarm the poor and lower-middle peasants ideologically. This is a pipe dream; we will not fall for it. As soon as the words were spoken, Brigade Leader Guo Yushan suddenly pushed his way to the front from the crowd, pointing his pipe at the rich peasant's head and saying: "You, this remnant of the Kuomintang, were a traitor before liberation, and have never been honest since liberation. During the initial phase of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you even disguised yourself as a revolutionary to 'rebel,' hoping to change the situation. Today, we poor and lower-middle peasants will not let you off." The meeting was filled with indignation, with everyone eager to speak, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and fighting against the rich peasant, making him admit his crimes.

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

　　抓住活材料狠斗狠批
    上丈子生产队的贫下中农有个习惯，每天晚上都要坐在炕头上听广播。
    一天晚上，房东李大娘正和全家围坐在炕上，聚精会神地听毛主席的最新指示和报纸社论。突然，“咯”的一声喇叭不响了。李大娘赶忙叫孙儿爱军看看是怎么回事，爱军取下喇叭检查，扬声器和广播线全是好的。忽然，李大娘好象发现了喇叭不响的“秘密”，把正在摆弄喇叭的爱军拉到跟前耳语了几句，只见爱军拿起手电就跑出门去了。
    原来通向李大娘家的广播线路与西院的富农分子家的广播线连接在一起，是这个富农分子把广播线给截断了。小爱军跑到富农分子屋里按亮手电一看，只见这个坏家伙正在慌慌张张地往炕席下藏广播线呢。小爱军气得上前一把夺过广播线，富农分子慌忙追了出去，企图从爱军手中夺回被截断的广播线，两人争夺起来，惊动了东西两院的群众和支农的解放军排长虢文彬同志。排长心想：这是向群众进行阶级教育的活教材，提议立即召开一个批判斗争大会。
    会上，李大娘气愤地说：叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇一贯鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，企图让我们放松对阶级敌人的警惕，以便他们进行反革命复辟活动。今天看得更清楚了，地主、富农分子都是屋檐底下的洋葱，根焦叶黄心不死。毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”告诉叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，你妄图解除我们贫下中农的思想武装，这是白日作梦，我们决不上你的当。话音刚落，生产队长郭玉山忽地从人群中挤到前面，用旱烟管指着富农分子的脑袋说：“你这个国民党残渣余孽，解放前当汉奸，解放后一贯不老实，无产阶级文化大革命初期又伪装革命起来‘造反’，妄想变天。今天，我们贫下中农绝不放过你们。”大会上，群情激愤，个个争先发言，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，狠斗富农分子，斗得他不得不低头认罪。
