We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, listened to the bulletin of the Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party on the radio. We are all filled with immense excitement and warmly celebrate the success of this meeting. Every word of the bulletin, personally presided over and approved by our great leader Chairman Mao, resonates deeply in our hearts. We wholeheartedly support it and fully agree with it.

This plenary session of great historical significance decided to convene the 9th National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time, which is the greatest joy for the entire Party and the people of the nation. The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the conditions for holding the 9th National Congress have been fully prepared in terms of ideology, politics, and organization. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, are determined to welcome the victorious convening of the 9th National Congress of the Party with our unwavering loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao and our practical actions in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The plenary session unanimously resolved to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Liu Shaoqi, the faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, has done nothing but evil since he infiltrated the Party and the revolutionary ranks over the decades. The crimes he committed against the Party and the people are innumerable and unforgivable. Dazhai Brigade is a red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao. In the old society, landlords and rich peasants treated the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai like cattle. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from misery. It was Chairman Mao who led us to walk the socialist path, to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, and to transform a poor and backward Dazhai into a new socialist Dazhai. It was Chairman Mao who issued the great call to "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture." However, Liu Shaoqi, this hidden scoundrel within the Party, has always been on a different path from us poor and lower-middle peasants. He has always been close to all reactionaries at home and abroad, harboring deep hatred for Mao Zedong Thought, socialism, and us poor and lower-middle peasants. He has repeatedly tried in every possible way to cut down the red flag of Dazhai. In 1964, he took the opportunity of the socialist education movement in the countryside to instruct his agents in Shanxi to send work teams, fabricate charges, distort facts, and attempt to frame Chen Yonggui, who has always studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, with the malicious intent to destroy Dazhai Brigade. They maliciously said, "The flagpole of the red flag of Dazhai has worms." The Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, foiled their conspiracy.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has exposed the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by Liu Shaoqi. The facts have fully proven that Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices are the biggest pests and the most vicious enemies under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The unanimous resolution of this plenary session to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever is a joyous event that delights the hearts of the people. This action greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses and the people of the world, and it greatly dampens the spirits of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries at home and abroad.

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, resolutely respond to the call of the Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, earnestly carry out each directive of Chairman Mao, and continue to deeply engage in revolutionary criticism and struggle. We will thoroughly purge the long-standing poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by Liu Shaoqi, and clean it out completely. Under the leadership of the working class, we will be the most reliable allies of the working class and earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform. We will more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise our political awareness in the struggle, and resolutely and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, Promote Work, and Promote Preparedness for War." We will produce more grain and industrial raw materials to support the liberation of Taiwan. We will be ready at any time. As soon as our great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will be ready with people and grain. We are determined, together with the people of the entire nation, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会号召
    以实际行动迎接党的九次代表大会的召开
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队全体贫下中农
    我们大寨的全体贫下中农，从广播里听到党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，都怀着万分激动的心情，热烈欢呼这次会议的成功。伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持通过的公报，一字一句都说到我们心坎里，我们一千个拥护，一万个赞成。
    这次具有伟大历史意义的全会决定：在适当的时候召开党的第九次全国代表大会，这是全党和全国人民的最大喜事。伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导的。经过两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，已经从思想上、政治上、组织上为召开第九次代表大会准备了充分的条件。我们大寨全体贫下中农，决心以对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，以紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的实际行动，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的胜利召开。
    全会一致通过决议，把埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇和他的同伙叛党叛国的罪行。这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利。刘少奇这个帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，钻进党和革命队伍以来的几十年里，干尽了坏事，对党和人民犯下的滔天罪行是说不尽，数不清的。我们大寨大队是毛主席亲手树起来的一面红旗。在旧社会，地主、富农把大寨的贫下中农当做牛马，是毛主席把我们从苦水里救出来；是毛主席领导我们走社会主义道路、发扬自力更生的精神，把一个穷大寨、旧大寨变成社会主义的新大寨；是毛主席发出了“农业学大寨”的伟大号召。但是，刘少奇这个埋藏在党内的大坏蛋，从来就是和我们贫下中农走着两股道。他对国内外一切反动派亲，对毛泽东思想、对社会主义、对我们贫下中农刻骨仇恨。他一回又一回千方百计地要砍掉大寨这面红旗。一九六四年，他借农村搞社会主义教育运动的机会，指使他在山西的代理人派出工作队，捏造罪名，颠倒黑白，妄想陷害一贯活学活用毛主席著作的陈永贵同志，处心积虑要把大寨大队搞垮。他们胡说什么“大寨这面红旗的旗杆上生了虫虫”。大寨党支部和贫下中农一起，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，粉碎了他们的这个阴谋。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命，把刘少奇等党内最大一小撮走资派揪了出来。事实完全证明：刘少奇和他的同伙，是最大的害人虫，是无产阶级专政条件下最凶恶的敌人。这次全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，这是大快人心的大喜事，是我们贫下中农的一致要求。这样做，大长了全国革命群众和世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派的威风。
    我们大寨全体贫下中农坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的号召，认真执行毛主席的每一项指示，继续深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派长期以来在各个方面散布的反革命修正主义流毒，把它清扫得一干二净。我们决心在工人阶级领导下，做好工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，认真搞好斗、批、改。我们要更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。坚决彻底执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，多打粮食，多产工业原料，支援解放我国领土台湾。随时作好准备，只要伟大领袖毛主席一声令下，要人有人，要粮有粮。我们决心同全国人民一道，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
