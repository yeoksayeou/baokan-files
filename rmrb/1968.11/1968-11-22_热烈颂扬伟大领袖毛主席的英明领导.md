The revolutionary people of various ethnic groups in Yunnan are studying the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party in depth and resolutely implementing it. They are warmly praising the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are vehemently denouncing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's treasonous crimes of betraying the Party and the country. A new upsurge of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism has swept across the province.

In the past ten days or so, the 23 million people of various ethnic groups in Yunnan have, while studying the communiqué of the plenary session, linked the country's revolutionary struggles over the past few decades with the struggles of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They have gained a deeper understanding that the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao is unparalleled in its wisdom and correctness.

From the banks of the Jinsha River to the dense forests of Xishuangbanna, the Han, Tibetan, Yi, Bai, Naxi, Lisu, Hani, Wa, Lahu, Blang, Dai, and other ethnic groups have, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, used different languages to repeatedly shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses of the Zhaotong, Lijiang, Chuxiong, Honghe, Dali, and Xishuangbanna prefectures and autonomous regions have, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held to study and implement the communiqué of the plenary session, enthusiastically discussed the great, decisive victories of the Cultural Revolution and warmly praised the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. They said, in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution, at every critical juncture, Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction of victory for us. The history of the Chinese revolution and the history of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years have told us a truth: following Chairman Mao is victory.

In the process of studying the communiqué of the plenary session, the revolutionary people of the entire province have become more attached to Chairman Mao and more loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. They have decided to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to unify their thoughts, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, to complete the great tasks proposed in the communiqué, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. At present, a new upsurge of the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has swept across the entire province.

The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants are using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution, production, and all their actions. The 327 households of laboring people in the Erduoluo Township of Bijie County all engage in the "three loyalties" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line every day, and each family insists on studying Chairman Mao's works. In the entire township of 1,819 people, 1,089 can recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune" from memory, 684 can recite the "Three Articles," and 329 can recite 30 to 120 quotations from Chairman Mao. The most remote community in this township, the ancient bottom of the second community, has 22 households, and each family has set up a family study class, often using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism. The Wa people in the Xishuangbanna region were once slandered by Liu Shaoqi's agent in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan, Zhao Jianmin, and others as people who "do not know how to eat, do not know how to dress, and have no culture." Yan Hongyan, Zhao Jianmin, and a handful of capitalist roaders fiercely opposed the Wa people in this region from studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Wa nationality in this region, even the elderly, can recite dozens of quotations from Chairman Mao, and the young people can recite the "Three Articles" from memory. They are pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage. They say, "The more a handful of capitalist roaders oppose us from studying Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study. The words of the elders can be discarded, but the words of Chairman Mao cannot be discarded! 'We will read Chairman Mao's books for life and listen to Chairman Mao's words for life.'"

The revolutionary people of various ethnic groups in Yunnan resolutely support the decision of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions inside and outside the Party. In the new upsurge of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the entire province, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the number one capitalist roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, have launched a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary masses are using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," and the reactionary revisionist black goods of "backwardness of the border areas" and "special characteristics of the border areas." At the current provincial, prefectural, and county-level cadre meetings, the deputy director of the Yunnan Revolutionary Committee and the famous female hero of the nation, Xu Xuehui, the national militia hero of the Zhuang nationality, Wang Dan, and the national combat hero and current member of the West County Revolutionary Committee, Tu Xun, pointed out unanimously that the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle issue." Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, and his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan, Zhao Jianmin, and others, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's instructions on national struggles and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is an attempt to restore capitalism and betray the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist thoughts, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导
    云南各族革命人民认真学习党的十二中全会公报，越学对毛主席越亲，越学对毛泽东思想越忠。全省掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想和革命大批判的新高潮。广大革命群众决心为完成公报提出的各项伟大战斗任务而努力奋斗
    新华社昆明电　云南省各族革命人民深入学习和坚决贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，颂扬毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇叛党叛国的反革命罪行，在全省掀起了波澜壮阔的活学活用毛泽东思想和革命大批判的新高潮。
    最近十多天来，云南两千三百万各族革命人民，在学习全会公报时，联系我国几十年来的革命斗争实践，联系两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，更加深刻地体会到，我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导无比英明、无比正确。
    从金沙江畔到西双版纳密林，汉、藏、怒、白、纳西、傈僳、哈尼、佤、拉祜、布朗、傣族等各族革命人民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，用不同的语言，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”思茅、丽江、楚雄、红河、大理和西双版纳等专区、自治州的革委会和各族革命群众，在为学习和落实全会公报开办的毛泽东思想学习班里，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命伟大的、决定性的胜利，热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。他们说，两年多来的文化大革命，在每一个紧要关头，毛主席都为我们指明了胜利的航向。中国革命的历史，两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命的历史，都告诉我们一个真理：紧跟毛主席就是胜利。
    全省革命人民在学习全会公报的过程中，越学对毛主席越亲，越学对毛泽东思想越忠。他们决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，完成公报提出的各项伟大任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。目前，全省掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动新高潮。
    广大工人和贫下中农，用毛泽东思想指导革命，指导生产，指导自己的一切。碧江县俄夺罗乡的三百二十七户劳动人民，每天都开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，家家都坚持学习毛主席著作。全乡一千八百一十九人，有一千零八十九人能熟背《为人民服务》，六百八十四人能熟背“老三篇”，三百二十九人能背三十条到一百二十条毛主席语录。这个乡最偏僻的自古底二社，二十二户人家，家家都开办了家庭学习班，经常用毛泽东思想斗私批修。西盟山佤族地区的佤族人民，曾经被刘少奇在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流污蔑为“不会吃饭、不会穿衣、没有文化”的人，阎红彦、赵健民等一小撮走资派疯狂反对这里的佤族人民学习毛主席著作。现在这个地区的佤族贫下中农，老年人都能背几十条毛主席语录，青年人都能熟背“老三篇”，他们正把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新阶段。他们说：“一小撮走资派越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们越要学。阿爹阿妈的话丢得，毛主席的话丢不得！”“我们要一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话。”
    云南各族革命人民坚决拥护党的八届十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党和撤消其党内外一切职务的决定。全省革命人民在活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动新高潮中，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对党内头号走资派刘少奇的深仇大恨，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。广大革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批刘少奇推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“群众落后论”和“边疆落后”、“边疆特殊”等反革命修正主义黑货。在目前正在召开的省、专、县三级干部会议上，云南省革委会副主任、全国著名的女英雄徐学惠，全国民兵英雄七林汪丹（壮族），全国战斗英雄、现任西畴县革委会常委的涂勋等同志一致指出，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”刘少奇这个大坏蛋及其在云南的代理人疯狂地反对毛主席关于民族斗争的指示，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是妄图复辟资本主义，就是叛卖无产阶级革命事业。我们一定要把刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想批深批透，批倒批臭，搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
