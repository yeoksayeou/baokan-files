Tianjin Hongqiao District Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class must lead everything," organized a 10,000-strong Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team composed mainly of workers with a sense of urgency to widely and deeply promote and implement the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

Under the impetus of the propaganda team, more than 5,600 Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been set up in all factories, shops, schools, offices, and neighborhoods in the district to implement the great battle tasks proposed by the plenum. A total of 239,000 people have participated in the study. Thus, the spirit of the communiqué quickly penetrated the hearts of the people, became the conscious actions of the revolutionary masses, and became a powerful driving force for the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in the district quickly took on a new look.

On the evening of the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the Hongqiao District Revolutionary Committee and the military support liaison station held an emergency meeting to study the communiqué, deeply understand it, and discuss and formulate measures to implement the great battle tasks proposed by the plenum. The leaders of the revolutionary committees at all levels took the lead in lecturing on the communiqué and quickly organized a propaganda team of more than 15,000 people, composed mainly of workers, including soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, and neighborhood residents, to go deep into the grassroots and enthusiastically promote the communiqué. They used various forms of promotion, lively and vivid, to ensure that every street had a propaganda station and every place had a propagandist. Fixed-point and mobile propaganda were combined, and a mass movement to study and promote the communiqué, enthusiastically praise the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically praise the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was quickly launched throughout the district. The revolutionary workers of Dongfeng Garment Factory set up ten propaganda stations for the communiqué on the main streets near the factory. Many female workers moved their bedding to the factory to enthusiastically promote the communiqué. The district had more than a thousand propaganda squads, active every day on the front line of promoting the communiqué.

Under the promotion of the propaganda team, all units in the district, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the content of implementing the great battle tasks proposed by the plenum. The broad revolutionary masses were organized into the study classes as widely as possible. The revolutionary masses and cadres expressed their determination to carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, to study the communiqué well, to further raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and to achieve new victories in the struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many units used the study classes as the battlefield, linked the class struggle in their units, used the handful of class enemies they had exposed as living examples, and fiercely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the merits of exploitation." The more they criticized, the more they loved Chairman Mao, and the more they hated Liu Shaoqi. After criticizing Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "bonus as the mainstay," "material incentive," and "expert management," the workers of Lianhua Sewing Factory were full of vigor.

Through the extensive promotion and study of the communiqué and the launch of revolutionary criticism, the spirit of the communiqué penetrated the hearts of the people. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it produces tremendous material force and powerfully promotes the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the district. The work of cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying and building the party, reforming unreasonable regulations, and grasping the revolution and promoting production has all taken on a new look. Some units, through the promotion of the communiqué, further mobilized the masses to expose hidden class enemies, making the revolutionary and production situation in the factory completely new. The Yongge Plastic Factory had previously made slow progress in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Through the study of the communiqué, the workers, with a sense of responsibility as masters, wrote four investigation reports, which played a good role in promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory. The situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production in the district was hot and lively, and reports of creating new production records came one after another.

    天津红桥区革委会组织以工人为主体的毛泽东思想宣传队
    深入基层单位宣传党的十二中全会公报
    在宣传队推动下，全区大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实全会提出的战斗任务，有力地推动了斗批改
    新华社天津八日电　天津市红桥区革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的教导，以“只争朝夕”的精神组织起以工人为主体的万人毛泽东思想宣传队，在全区广泛深入地宣传、贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报。
    在宣传队的推动下，全区各工厂、商店、学校、机关和街道已经办起五千六百多个落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的毛泽东思想学习班，有二十三万九千多人参加学习。这样，公报的精神迅速深入人心，变为广大革命群众的自觉行动，成为推动斗、批、改的强大动力，使全区的斗、批、改很快出现了新局面。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表的当晚，红桥区革委会和驻军支左联络站连夜召开紧急会议，认真学习，深刻领会，讨论并制定了落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的措施。各级革命委员会负责人层层带头宣讲公报，并在全区迅速组织了一支以工人为主体，有解放军指战员、革命领导干部、红卫兵小将、革命教师、街道居民参加的一万五千多人的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层热情宣传公报。他们宣传的形式多样，生动活泼，做到了每街都有宣传站，到处都有宣传员，定点宣传和流动宣传相结合，在全区范围内迅速掀起了一个学习和宣传公报，热烈赞颂伟大领袖毛主席，热烈赞颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线伟大胜利的群众运动。东风服装厂革命职工在工厂附近的主要街头，建立了十个公报宣传站。许多女工为了热情宣传公报，把铺盖搬到了厂里，全区有上千个宣传小分队，天天活跃在宣传公报的第一线上。
    在宣传队的促进下，全区各单位遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，大办以落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务为内容的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，最广泛地把广大革命群众组织到学习班里来。广大革命群众和革命干部表示，一定要发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，好好学习公报，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中立新功。很多单位以学习班为战场，联系本单位的阶级斗争实际，以揪出的一小撮阶级敌人作为活生生的事例，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功论”，大家越批对毛主席越亲，越批对刘少奇越恨。联华缝纫厂在批判了刘少奇推行的“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货以后，工人们干劲倍增。
    通过对公报的大宣传、大学习和开展革命大批判，公报的精神深入人心。毛泽东思想一旦为广大群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量，有力地推动了全区的斗、批、改。清理阶级队伍、整党建党、改革不合理的规章制度和抓革命、促生产等各项工作，都出现了新的局面。有的单位通过宣传公报，群众进一步行动起来，揪出了暗藏的阶级敌人，使厂里的革命、生产面貌焕然一新。永革塑料厂过去斗、批、改进展不快，通过学习公报，工人们以主人翁的责任感写出了四份调查报告，对推动本厂斗、批、改起了很好的作用。全区抓革命促生产的形势热气腾腾，创造生产新纪录的捷报一个个传来。
