Edition: 6

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to develop capitalism in China and oppose the socialist revolution, vigorously promoted the "technical center" theory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he absurdly claimed: "Technical work is the most promising. In the future, after the enemy is defeated and there is no more war, technical work will be the center. ... At that time, technical work will take the leading position, ... and at that time, technical work will determine everything." After liberation, he obscured the classes and class struggle in socialist society, advocating that as long as we do well in "technical innovation and technical revolution," we can enter communism.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's set of ideas is not some new invention but merely a collection of old, discarded goods from the old revisionists like Bernstein and Kautsky. The old revisionists argued that in economically backward and underdeveloped conditions, the proletariat could not and should not carry out a socialist revolution. This fallacy has long been refuted by Lenin and Stalin. The traitor Liu Shaoqi inherited the legacy of the old revisionists, fundamentally denying the advanced ideas of the proletariat, the proletarian dictatorship, and the socialist system's role in promoting the development of productive forces. He fundamentally denied that class struggle is the driving force of social development and that the people are the creators of world history. Under the banner of the "technical center" theory, he opposed the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, opposed the proletarian political line, opposed science and technology serving proletarian politics, obstructed and sabotaged the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, denied the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work, and implemented bourgeois dictatorship in the field of science and technology. The traitor Liu Shaoqi attempted to make us forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, focus only on technology, and not engage in revolution, leading China's scientific and technological work down the capitalist path to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on science and technology and expose the reactionary nature of the "technical center" theory.

Promoting the "Technical Center" Theory is to Restore Capitalism

Marx and Engels pointed out: "The history of all hitherto existing society (i.e., the history of written history) is the history of class struggles." Class struggle "is the direct driving force of history."

Our great leader Chairman Mao, using the principles of Marxism-Leninism, summarized the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship, comprehensively and systematically analyzed the classes and class struggle in socialist society, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The socialist society is a relatively long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." The development of socialist society forward is still through the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, through the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. This is the direct driving force for the development of socialist society forward.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously denied that class struggle is the driving force for the development of socialist society. He absurdly claimed: "The main task of our people and the Party is to rapidly develop the productive forces." He also spread poison: "In the future, everything will require specialized knowledge and specialized technology. ... Each person should just learn one or two technologies." This is a pure "theory of the extinction of class struggle." In this historical stage of socialism, class struggle objectively exists. If the proletariat loses vigilance and does not actively launch an offensive against the bourgeoisie, carrying the class struggle to final victory, then the bourgeoisie will certainly launch an offensive against the proletariat, attempting to seize back their "paradise" that they have already lost. Therefore, the traitor Liu Shaoqi only talks about "developing productive forces" and "learning science and technology," never mentioning that the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism are the driving forces for the development of socialist society. This is a cunning tactic of the bourgeoisie's offensive against the proletariat.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi has never been a revolutionary of the proletariat but has always been an agent of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the bourgeoisie.

On the eve of the victory of the Chinese revolution, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, in a state of panic, desperately defended the capitalist system and vigorously praised the technical knowledge and management level of bureaucratic capitalists. Under the pretext of "taking technical work as the center," he fiercely opposed the state's takeover of bureaucratic capitalist factories, absurdly claiming that "after the takeover, it is not as good as the capitalists' management." Not only that, he even wanted to sell out New China to the imperialist bandits. He shamelessly shouted: "In the future, even if imperialism opens mines and factories in China, it can be allowed under the condition of mutual benefit." Isn't this the tone of a Kuomintang traitor? Isn't this fully exposing his face as a loyal running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries?

Is it true that after the state took over the bureaucratic capitalist factories, they were not managed as well as by the capitalists? The industry of New China has grown from small to large, and one after another, New China's scientific and technological achievements have caught up with and surpassed the world's advanced levels. The magnificent socialist construction cause is advancing with unparalleled giant steps. These facts have completely shattered the traitor Liu Shaoqi's shameless lies.

After the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the traitor Liu Shaoqi again raised the tattered banner of the "technical center" theory to engage in sabotage and disruption. He absurdly claimed that the era of "technical revolution as the central task" has arrived, and "through technical innovation and technical revolution," we will "enter communism." According to this reactionary "theory," in the socialist stage, there no longer exist the two classes and two roads of struggle, and there is no longer a need for proletarian dictatorship. As long as we do well in "technical innovation and technical revolution," we will "enter communism." This is a lie of cosmic proportions.

Lenin pointed out: "The development towards communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot go through any other path, because no one else and no other path can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist class."

Chairman Mao taught us: "In socialist society, there still exist classes and class struggle, and there is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. It is not enough to have a socialist revolution on the economic front (in the ownership of the means of production) and it is not solid. There must also be a thorough socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front."

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, fearing to touch even a hair of the bourgeoisie, shamelessly distorted Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He told the capitalists: "Revolutionizing the bourgeoisie is Marx's conclusion. But in China, we can build socialism without revolutionizing you." "This is called peaceful transformation." At a meeting on the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial enterprises, the traitor Liu Shaoqi also absurdly claimed: "Some (capitalists) are very capable, there are clever and efficient people, there are also those who understand technology, and even their management capabilities surpass our Communist Party members, our comrades. If they are persuaded ... to manage the factory, if they manage it well, then why not?" In his view, only the bourgeoisie has technology, has ability, and can manage our factories and our country. The traitor Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "peaceful transformation" is to "peacefully transform" the proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and to "peacefully transform" socialism into capitalism. Therefore, the "technical center" theory advocated by the traitor Liu Shaoqi is his reactionary "theory" for restoring capitalism, and the traitor Liu Shaoqi himself is an unrepentant traitor to Marxism-Leninism and a sworn enemy of the proletarian dictatorship!

Science and Technology Work Must Be Led by Proletarian Politics

Chairman Mao has always taught us: "Politics is the commander, it is the soul." "Only through politics can the needs of the class and the masses be concentratedly expressed." China's scientific and technological work must be led by proletarian politics and must serve proletarian politics and socialist construction. If we relax ideological and political work, scientific and technological work will definitely go astray. Therefore, arming the minds of scientific and technological workers with Mao Zedong Thought, transforming the bourgeois worldview, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and building a proletarian scientific and technological team is a top priority to ensure that China's scientific and technological cause develops in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, vigorously distorted the relationship between politics and technology as commander and commanded, fiercely opposed the leadership of proletarian politics over scientific and technological work, and vigorously promoted the rightist slogan of "technology first," which is actually bourgeois politics first.

First, he said: "For genuine technical issues, political leadership alone is not enough, advanced technology is also needed." This is the tone of opportunism. Opportunists either pay lip service to emphasizing proletarian politics or equate technology with politics, but in reality, they oppose emphasizing proletarian politics. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Politics is the most fundamental thing. If political work and ideological work are not done well, then all other work is out of the question." Only by studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought can we promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, make scientific and technological work develop in the correct direction, and give full play to its greatest strength.

Second, he said: "To cultivate experts, intellectuals can be prevented from joining the Party and participating in political activities." This is the so-called "expert but not red" theory of the bourgeois rightists. Natural sciences and technology themselves are not class-based, but who controls science and technology and for whom they serve are strongly class-based. The traitor Liu Shaoqi seduced scientific and technological workers to not ask about politics and to focus on their work, which is to oppose scientific and technological work serving proletarian politics and to lead scientific and technological work down the capitalist path.

Third, he said: "Political study and professional training cannot be done together, they must be separated." "At present, the main focus is on learning culture and technology, and politics will be learned in the future." This is the so-called "expert first, red later" theory of the bourgeois rightists. Politics is the commander of all work and also the commander of scientific and technological work. Politics always belongs to a certain class. It is either proletarian politics in command or bourgeois politics in command. The so-called "learning politics in the future" is actually to let bourgeois politics take command. It can be seen how sinister the traitor Liu Shaoqi's intentions are!

The traitor Liu Shaoqi used the black goods of the "technical center" theory to vigorously corrupt and poison the minds of scientific and technological workers. He vigorously peddled a whole set of revisionist junk, such as business first, technology supreme, material incentives, and personal gain. However, despite all the changes, the core remains his whole set of bourgeois philistine philosophy. This "great person" summarized it with "refined" language, calling it "as long as you master a specialty, you will have everything in the future." This is his "great personal ideal" that he often preaches to people. He even shamelessly and bluntly said: "For personal fame and gain, ... everyone has this ideal, isn't it better to have more money?"

This is indeed a wonderful confession of the bourgeois philistine! "For personal fame and gain" is the core of the bourgeois worldview. The bourgeoisie always uses slogans such as "master mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and you will be fearless anywhere in the world," "technology is an iron rice bowl," etc., to lure intellectuals to serve them. Guided by such ugly thoughts, organizing their scientific and technological teams, this team can only serve bourgeois politics, making China's scientific and technological cause return to the old path of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China. The traitor Liu Shaoqi used these baits to poison and corrupt scientific and technological workers, making people detach from proletarian politics, deviate from the socialist direction, "comfortably" undergo peaceful evolution, become tools of the bourgeoisie, and allow him to brazenly engage in usurpation of the Party and the country, and the evil activities of restoring capitalism. It is truly cunning to the extreme!

The Soviet revisionist leadership has always regarded the scientific and technological community as an important stronghold for their restoration of capitalism. They vigorously promoted material incentives, personal gain, cultivated a privileged class, and raised spiritual aristocrats, making the first socialist state in the world, founded by Lenin, "peacefully evolve" into a state of bourgeois dictatorship. This is a serious historical lesson. The traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously induced people to treat scientific and technological knowledge as private property, waiting to be sold, as political capital for pursuing personal fame and gain. His evil purpose is to make our country repeat the fate of the Soviet revisionists' "satellite in the sky, red flag on the ground"!

Scientific and Technological Personnel Must Combine with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to combine with the workers and peasants." Recently, he also taught: "Students trained in old schools, most or the majority can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some people even have inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcome by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts illuminate the path forward for China's scientific and technological personnel. The broad masses of workers and peasants have the most steadfast stance, the clearest hatred and love, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. However, including scientific and technological personnel among the intellectuals, before they combine with workers and peasants, they "often have subjective and individualistic tendencies, their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." Therefore, scientific and technological personnel must go out of the laboratory and office, go among the broad masses of workers and peasants, put down their airs, humbly learn from workers and peasants, accept re-education from workers and peasants, blend in with them, thoroughly transform their bourgeois worldview, and wholeheartedly serve workers and peasants. This is the necessary path for the revolutionization of the thoughts of scientific and technological personnel.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, this bourgeois lord, has never looked down on the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, even slandering them as "unreliable" and "backward" "mob." In his view, only those bourgeois "authorities" with technology and "specialized knowledge" and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists can be relied upon. Therefore, he vigorously resisted the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, fiercely opposed the ideological reform of intellectuals, and vigorously promoted the idea of "cultivating oneself in seclusion," "two ears not hearing the affairs outside the window, one heart only reading the classics," so that one day he could "master a technology" and "achieve fame and fortune," riding on the heads of the working people and acting arrogantly.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's "technical center" theory is a reactionary fallacy that despises workers and peasants and opposes the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants.

Combining with workers and peasants is not only necessary for the ideological reform of scientific and technological personnel but also necessary for scientific and technological personnel to have inventions and creations in their work.

The working class and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The broad masses of working people, through long-term revolutionary struggles, have accumulated rich experience, possess boundless wisdom and creativity. They are also our best teachers in science and technology.

However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi elevated bourgeois experts and technical personnel to the heavens, absurdly claiming: "Our country's progress" depends on "the efforts of scientists, especially the old scientists taking the lead"; the socialist construction of the country "especially depends on managers, engineers, and technicians."

Do these bourgeois scientific and technological personnel really have such a great role in socialist construction? No. The countless facts exposed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have shattered the traitor Liu Shaoqi's lie. Bourgeois technical "authorities" are not only reactionary in political and ideological terms but also often "silver-plated guns" and "embroidered pillows stuffed with straw" in technology. Some people who claim to be experts and "authorities" in a certain field do not even understand the basic knowledge and basic operations of their field, and they are even more useless in science and technology. Such things, haven't we seen enough of them? In contrast, over the past nineteen years, the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants have made a large number of inventions and creations in science and technology, once again proving the truth of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish."

Chairman Mao taught us: "In a certain sense, the wisest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." "Many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes a bit more." We scientific and technological personnel should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, respectfully and sincerely learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, combine with them, summarize practical experience, and make China's scientific and technological cause quickly catch up with and surpass the international advanced level, making great contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's "technical center" theory is a reactionary fallacy that advocates for scientific and technological work to detach from proletarian politics, detach from the masses of workers and peasants, and detach from production practice. It is a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy that opposes China's scientific and technological cause advancing under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought along the socialist path. We must thoroughly criticize and expose it.

The Working Class Must Firmly Grasp the Leadership of Science and Technology

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work." Therefore, whether the leadership of scientific and technological work is firmly in the hands of the working class is a key issue related to whether China's scientific and technological work can advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao also taught us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Comrade Lin Biao instructed that our cadre policy must be to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and have revolutionary enthusiasm as the standard. Resolutely oppose the purely military viewpoint and the purely technical viewpoint; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes emphasizing politics, no matter how great their ability, must be resolutely removed from office.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi hysterically shouted: "Recruit a batch of engineers into the Party ... should break down barriers and let more experts join the leading collective. On the one hand, outsiders become insiders, and on the other hand, insiders become Communist Party members." This is sheer madness!

In a class society, engineers and experts belong to different classes. The proletariat has proletarian engineers and experts, and the bourgeoisie has bourgeois engineers and experts. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached importance to the unity, education, and reform of intellectuals and has paid attention to recruiting those who meet the conditions of Party membership from among them into the Party. At the same time, Chairman Mao has always emphasized that intellectuals joining the Party must solve the fundamental problem of worldview. In 1957, Chairman Mao also clearly pointed out: "Most of our intellectuals now come from the old society and are from non-laboring people's families. Some people, even if they come from the families of workers and peasants, received bourgeois education before liberation, and their worldview is basically bourgeois. They still belong to the bourgeois intellectuals." Comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with the traitor Liu Shaoqi's fallacies, the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist face is fully exposed.

Under the instructions and support of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi openly shouted: "Even if developing Party members among high-level intellectuals brings in some bad things, it doesn't matter." The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the scientific and technological community also vigorously promoted the idea of "good at business is good at politics, can join the Party." They vigorously recruited bourgeois intellectuals, even pulling bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" into the Party and placing them in important leadership positions. Therefore, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, without asking about political tendencies and without distinguishing class boundaries, generally proposed to "recruit a batch of engineers into the Party" and to "let more experts join the leading collective." These "engineers" and "experts," this "leading collective," are definitely not proletarian but can only be bourgeois.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to usurp the Party's leadership, adopted extremely cunning counter-revolutionary tactics. On the one hand, he used the excuse of "outsiders becoming insiders" to shout that revolutionary cadres should no longer engage in politics and "must pay attention to studying business, learning science and technology," vigorously attempting to make revolutionary cadres degenerate and change. On the other hand, he denounced revolutionary cadres as a "guerrilla unit," absurdly claiming that "the unit must be changed." He used the excuse of "insiders becoming Communist Party members" to dream of using engineers and college graduates who are detached from workers and peasants to "replace those who do not understand technology" and to use high-level bourgeois intellectuals to manage the Party Central Committee's organizational department. The word "replace" and the word "topple" fully expose the wolfish ambitions of this biggest capitalist roader within the Party. Exposing his tricks, he wanted to use the counter-revolutionary revisionist banner of the "technical center" theory to cover up using bourgeois experts and reactionary academic "authorities" to "replace" proletarian revolutionary cadres and using bourgeois dictatorship to "replace" proletarian dictatorship. It is truly laughable!

Now, the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories. Except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, and the situation is excellent. To respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we must further deepen the criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist ideological poison spread by the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in the field of science and technology, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and for turning the Academy into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

    戳穿大叛徒刘少奇“技术中心”论的反动本质
    中国科学院革命委员会
    叛徒刘少奇为了在中国发展资本主义，反对社会主义革命，就大肆宣扬“技术中心”论。他在抗日战争时期就胡说什么：“技术工作是最有前途的，将来把敌人消灭掉，不打仗了，就要以技术工作为中心。……那时技术工作就要占首要地位，……到那时技术工作就要决定一切。”解放后，他抹煞社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争，鼓吹只要搞好“技术革新、技术革命”，就可以进入共产主义。
    叛徒刘少奇兜售的这一套并不是什么新鲜货色，只不过是从伯恩斯坦、考茨基等老修正主义者那里拾来的“生产力论”的破烂货。老修正主义者叫嚷在经济落后、生产力不发达的情况下，无产阶级就不可能也不应该进行社会主义革命。这个谬论早已被列宁和斯大林所粉碎。叛徒刘少奇继承了老修正主义者的衣钵，根本否认无产阶级的先进思想、无产阶级专政、社会主义制度对发展生产力的促进作用，根本否认阶级斗争是社会发展的动力，根本否认人民群众是世界历史的创造者。他打着“技术中心”论的旗号，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，反对无产阶级政治挂帅，反对科学技术为无产阶级政治服务，阻挠和破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，否认党对科学技术工作的领导，在科学技术领域实行资产阶级专政。叛徒刘少奇妄图使我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，只抓技术，不搞革命，把我国科学技术工作引上资本主义的邪路，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义科技路线，戳穿“技术中心”论的反动本质。
    宣扬“技术中心”论就是要复辟资本主义
    马克思、恩格斯指出：“到目前为止的一切社会的历史（确切地说，这是指有文字记载的历史。……）都是阶级斗争的历史。”阶级斗争“是历史的直接动力”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，运用马克思列宁主义原理，总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，全面地、系统地分析了社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席指出：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”社会主义社会向前发展，仍然是通过无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争，通过社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。这是社会主义社会向前发展的直接动力。
    叛徒刘少奇极力否认阶级斗争是社会主义社会发展的动力。他胡说：“我国人民和党的主要任务，就是尽快地发展生产力”。他还大肆放毒：“今后搞什么都要专门知识，专门技术。……每个人要学好一两门技术就行”。这是地地道道的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，阶级斗争是客观存在。如果无产阶级丧失警惕性，不主动地向资产阶级发动进攻，把阶级斗争进行到最后胜利，那末，资产阶级就一定会向无产阶级发动进攻，妄图夺回他们已经失去的“天堂”。因此，叛徒刘少奇只谈“发展生产力”，只谈“学习科学和技术”，绝口不谈无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争是社会主义社会向前发展的动力，这是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一种狡猾的手段。
    叛徒刘少奇从来就不是无产阶级革命家，而是帝国主义、国民党反动派和资产阶级的代理人。
    在中国革命取得全国胜利前夕，叛徒刘少奇急红了眼，拚死命维护资本主义制度，大肆吹捧官僚资本家的技术知识和管理水平。他在“以技术工作为中心”的幌子下，疯狂反对国家接收官僚资本的工厂，胡说什么接收后“不如资本家管理得好”。不但如此，他甚至要把新中国出卖给帝国主义强盗。他无耻地叫嚣：“将来就是帝国主义在中国开矿、开工厂，在两利之下，也可允许的。”这不是十足的国民党卖国贼的腔调吗？这不就充分暴露了他的帝、修、反忠实走狗的面目吗？
    国家接收官僚资本的工厂后还“不如资本家管理得好”吗？新中国的工业从小到大，新中国的科学技术一项又一项地赶超世界先进水平，宏伟的社会主义建设事业正在以无可比拟的巨人步伐向前迈进。这些事实，彻底粉碎了叛徒刘少奇的无耻谰言。
    当经济战线上的社会主义革命取得基本胜利之后，叛徒刘少奇又打起“技术中心”论的破旗，进行破坏和捣乱。他胡说什么，“技术革命成为中心任务”的时代已经到了，“经过技术革新、技术革命”，“就进入了共产主义”。照这种反动“理论”，在社会主义阶段，已经不存在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争了，已经不需要无产阶级专政了，只要搞好“技术革新、技术革命”，就“进入了共产主义”。这是一个弥天大谎。
    列宁指出：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。单有在经济战线上（在生产资料所有制上）的社会主义革命，是不够的，并且是不巩固的。必须还有一个政治战线上和一个思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命。”
    叛徒刘少奇怕触动资产阶级的一根毫毛，公然无耻地篡改马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他对资本家说：“革资产阶级的命，这是马克思的结论。但是我们中国搞社会主义可以不革你们的命。”“这就叫和平转变。”在一次关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的会议上，叛徒刘少奇还胡说：“有些（资本家）是很能够作事的，精明干练的人有，懂得技术的人也不少，甚至他的管理能力超过我们的共产党员，超过我们的同志，如果把他说通了……来管理工厂，如果管得很好，那为什么不可以呢？”在他看来，只有资产阶级，才有技术，才有能力，才可以管理我们的工厂，管理我们的国家。叛徒刘少奇鼓吹的“和平转变”，就是要把无产阶级专政“和平演变”成资产阶级专政，要把社会主义“和平演变”成资本主义。因此，叛徒刘少奇所鼓吹的“技术中心”论，是他用来复辟资本主义的反动“理论”，而叛徒刘少奇自己，就是一个不折不扣的马克思列宁主义的叛徒、无产阶级专政的死敌！
    科技工作必须无产阶级政治挂帅
    毛主席历来教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“只有经过政治，阶级和群众的需要才能集中地表现出来。”我国的科学技术工作，一定要用无产阶级政治来统帅，一定要为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务。如果放松思想政治工作，科学技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。因此，用毛泽东思想武装科学技术工作者的头脑，改造资产阶级世界观，促进人的思想革命化，建立起一支无产阶级科学技术队伍，这是保证我国科学技术事业沿着毛主席所指引的方向发展的头等大事。
    叛徒刘少奇却极力歪曲政治同技术之间的统帅和被统帅的关系，拚命反对以无产阶级政治统帅科学技术工作，大肆鼓吹“技术第一”，实际上是资产阶级政治第一的右派论调。
    其一曰：“真正是技术问题，光政治挂帅还不行，还要有先进技术。”这是机会主义者的腔调。机会主义者或者对突出无产阶级政治阳奉阴违，或者把技术同政治相提并论，而实际上却是反对突出无产阶级政治。林副主席指出：“政治是最根本的东西，政治工作、思想工作不做好，其他一切工作就都无从谈起。”只有活学活用毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化，才能使科学技术工作沿着正确方向发展，发挥出它的最大力量。
    其二曰：“为了培养专家，知识分子可以不让他们入党，不让他们参加政治活动”。这就是资产阶级右派的所谓“只专不红”论。自然科学和技术本身是没有阶级性的，但是科学技术归谁掌握，为谁服务，却有着强烈的阶级性。叛徒刘少奇诱骗科学技术工作人员不问政治，埋头业务，就是反对科学技术工作为无产阶级政治服务，要把科学技术工作引到资本主义的邪路上去。
    其三曰：“政治学习和业务进修一起搞不行，要分开来进行。”“目前主要是学文化、学技术，将来学政治”。这也就是资产阶级右派的所谓“先专后红”论。政治是一切工作的统帅，也是科学技术工作的统帅。政治总是属于一定的阶级的。不是无产阶级政治挂帅，就是资产阶级政治挂帅。所谓“将来学政治”，实际上就是要让资产阶级政治来挂帅。可见判徒刘少奇的用心是何等险恶！
    叛徒刘少奇用“技术中心”论的黑货，极力腐蚀和毒害科学技术工作人员的思想。他大肆兜售一整套修正主义破烂货，什么业务第一、技术至上啊，什么物质刺激、名利挂帅啊，应有尽有。但是，万变不离其宗，核心仍是他的一整套资产阶级市侩哲学。这个“大人物”用“精炼”的语言把它概括起来，叫做“只要学好一门专长，将来成名成家，就有了一切”。这就是他经常向人们宣扬的“伟大的个人理想”。他甚至无耻地露骨地说：“为了个人名利，……这个理想谁都有，钱多些难道不好吗？”
    这确实是资产阶级市侩的绝妙自白！“为了个人名利”，是资产阶级世界观的核心。资产阶级总是用“学好数理化，走遍天下都不怕”，“技术是铁饭碗”等口号来网罗知识分子为他们服务。用这种丑恶思想作指导，组织他们的科技队伍，这个队伍就只能为资产阶级政治服务，使我国的科学技术事业重新回到半殖民地、半封建的旧中国老路。叛徒刘少奇就是利用这些诱饵，毒害和腐蚀科技工作人员，使人们脱离无产阶级政治，违背社会主义方向，“舒舒服服”地和平演变，充当资产阶级的工具，而他就可以放肆地进行篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。真是阴险之极！
    苏修领导集团一直是把科技界作为他们复辟资本主义的重要阵地。他们大搞物质刺激，名利挂帅，培植特权阶层，豢养精神贵族，使列宁亲手缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家“和平演变”成资产阶级专政的国家。这是一个严重的历史教训。叛徒刘少奇竭力诱使人们把科技知识当作私有财产，待价而沽，作为追求个人名利的政治资本。他的罪恶目的就是要使我国重蹈苏修“卫星上天，红旗落地”的覆辙！
    科技人员必须与工农兵结合
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”最近又教导：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的光辉思想，照亮了我国科技人员前进的道路。广大工农兵群众，立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的革命路线。而包括科技人员在内的知识分子，在没有与工农兵相结合的时候，“往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”因此，科技人员必须走出实验室和办公室，到广大工农兵中去，放下架子，虚心地向工农兵学习，接受工农兵的再教育，和他们打成一片，彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观，全心全意为工农兵服务。这是科技人员思想革命化的必由之路。
    叛徒刘少奇这个资产阶级老爷，从来不把工人阶级和贫下中农放在眼里，甚至诬蔑他们是“不能依靠的”，是“落后”的“群氓”。在他看来，只有那些有技术和“专门知识”的资产阶级“权威”和地、富、反、坏、右分子，才是可以依靠的。因此，他百般抵制知识分子与工农兵相结合，疯狂反对知识分子的思想改造，拚命鼓吹闭门“修养”，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，以便有朝一日“学好一门技术”，“成名成家”，骑在工农劳动人民头上作威作福。
    叛徒刘少奇的“技术中心”论，就是蔑视工农兵、反对知识分子与工农兵相结合的反动谬论。
    与工农兵相结合，不但是科学技术人员改造思想所必需，也是科技人员业务上要有所发明、创造所必需。
    工人阶级和广大贫下中农，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军。广大工农劳动人民，在长期的三大革命运动中，积累了丰富的经验，具有无穷的智慧和创造力。他们在科技上也是我们的最好的老师。
    可是，叛徒刘少奇却把资产阶级专家和技术人员捧上了天，胡说什么：“我们的国家要进步”，要“依靠科学家的努力，尤其需要老科学家带头”；国家的社会主义建设，“特别是依靠厂长、工程师和技师。”
    那些资产阶级的科技人员，果真在社会主义建设中有这么大的作用吗？否。在无产阶级文化大革命中揭露出来的无数事实，戳穿了叛徒刘少奇的这个谎言。资产阶级技术“权威”不但在政治思想上是反动的，在技术上也往往是“银样镴枪头”，是“绣花枕头一肚子的草”。一些号称某一行专家、“权威”的人们，竟然不懂本行的基本知识和基本操作，在科学技术上更无所作为，这样的事情，难道我们看到得还少吗？对比十九年来，工人阶级和贫下中农在科技上的大量发明、创造，再一次证明了毛主席指示的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”这一真理。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”我们科学技术人员，要遵照毛主席的教导，恭恭敬敬、诚诚恳恳地向工农兵学习，和工农兵结合，总结实践经验，使我国的科技事业迅速赶上和超过国际先进水平，为中国革命和世界革命作出伟大的贡献。
    叛徒刘少奇的“技术中心”论，是鼓吹科技工作脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农兵群众、脱离生产实际的反动谬论，是反对我国科学技术事业在毛泽东思想指引下，沿着社会主义大道前进的反革命修正主义谬论，我们必须把它彻底批倒批臭。
    工人阶级必须牢牢掌握科技领导权
    毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”因此，科技工作的领导权是否牢靠地掌握在工人阶级的手里，这是关系到我国的科技工作能不能沿着毛主席的革命路线前进的关键问题。
    毛主席还教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”林彪副主席指示说，我们的干部政策，必须是以高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，有革命干劲为标准。坚决反对单纯军事观点、单纯技术观点；谁反对毛主席，谁反对突出政治，不管他有天大的本事，也要坚决罢他的官。
    叛徒刘少奇歇斯底里地叫嚣：“吸收一批工程师入党……应该破除界限，多让几个专家参加领导集团，这一方面是外行变内行，一方面是内行变共产党员。”真是疯狂已极！
    在有阶级的社会里，工程师、专家是隶属于不同阶级的，无产阶级有无产阶级的工程师、专家，资产阶级有资产阶级的工程师、专家。我们伟大领袖毛主席一贯重视对知识分子的团结、教育和改造，并注意吸收他们当中具备党员条件的人到党内来。同时，毛主席一贯强调知识分子入党必须解决世界观这个根本问题。一九五七年，毛主席还明确指出：“我们现在的大多数的知识分子，是从旧社会过来的，是从非劳动人民家庭出身的。有些人即使是出身于工人农民的家庭，但是在解放以前受的是资产阶级教育，世界观基本上是资产阶级的，他们还是属于资产阶级的知识分子。”把毛主席的教导同叛徒刘少奇的谬论一对照，叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义面目就暴露无遗了。
    在叛徒刘少奇的指使和支持下，反革命修正主义分子陆定一公开叫嚷：“就是在高级知识分子中发展党员，带来一些坏东西也不要紧。”科技界的党内一小撮走资派，也拚命鼓吹“业务好就是政治好，就能入党”。他们极力网罗资产阶级知识分子，甚至把资产阶级反动学术“权威”也拉入党内，塞到重要领导岗位。因此，叛徒刘少奇不问政治倾向，不分阶级界限，笼统地提出要“吸收一批工程师入党”，要“多让几个专家参加领导集团”，这些“工程师”、“专家”，这个“领导集团”，就决不是无产阶级的，而只能是资产阶级的。
    叛徒刘少奇为了篡夺党的领导，采取了极其阴险的反革命两手。一方面，他以“外行变内行”为借口，叫嚣革命干部不要再搞政治了，“必须注意钻研业务，学习科学和技术”，极力要使革命干部蜕化变质。另一方面，他把革命干部斥之为“游击班子”，胡说什么“要换班子”。他以“内行变共产党员”为借口，梦想用脱离工农兵的“工程师”、“大学毕业生”去“顶那些不懂技术的”干部，还要用资产阶级的“高级知识分子”来管党中央的组织部。一个“换”字，一个“顶”字，就把这个党内最大的走资派的狼子野心暴露得淋漓尽致。拆穿他的鬼把戏，就是想在“技术中心”论的修正主义破旗掩护下，用资产阶级专家、反动学术“权威”，“顶”掉无产阶级革命干部，用资产阶级专政“换”掉无产阶级专政。真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”！
    现在，波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。全国除台湾省外，二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会，形势一片大好。为了响应党的第八届扩大的十二中全会的号召，我们要进一步深入开展大批判，肃清叛徒刘少奇及其同伙在科技方面所散播的反革命修正主义思想流毒，认真搞好斗、批、改，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为把科学院办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而努力奋斗！
