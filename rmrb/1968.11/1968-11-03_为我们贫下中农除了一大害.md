A thunderous spring thunderclap resounds through the sky, and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is transmitted far and wide. Upon hearing this great piece of news, all the poor and lower-middle peasants of Mao Shengsi Production Brigade in the suburbs of Xining, Qinghai Province, are extremely excited and extremely moved. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Liu Shaoqi is a traitor, spy, and scab within the Party, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, chaired by Chairman Mao, unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his Party and state positions. This resolution expresses the wishes of us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, removes a heavy burden from our shoulders, and eliminates a great evil for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We support it one thousand times and endorse it ten thousand times!

Before liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Mao Shengsi Production Brigade suffered immense exploitation and oppression from landlords and rich peasants. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the miserable days of water and fire. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for us poor and lower-middle peasants. However, just as we were advancing victoriously along the socialist broad road of the people's commune as indicated by Chairman Mao, the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "work points as the commander" in the countryside. Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to launch a counterattack, making the socialist countryside chaotic and destroying the collective economy. We hate this traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi to the core. If his plot had succeeded, we would have to suffer again.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Mao Shengsi Production Brigade responded resolutely to the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and seized back the leadership power that had been usurped by Liu Shaoqi's agents in the countryside. Class struggle practice has educated us, making us realize that Liu Shaoqi is our sworn enemy. Over the past two years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution, have carried out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism, using living facts to criticize the reactionary revisionist trash of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, making it stink to high heaven, and greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction." Our brigade has undergone a tremendous change in less than a year. Now, the members are devoted to the public good, and there are countless examples of love for the collective. This year, our brigade's grain production increased by 47 percent compared to last year, the total income of the brigade increased by 70 percent, and the water conservancy project is equivalent to the total of the past 18 years since liberation.

All the poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade pledge to Chairman Mao: We will resolutely respond to your great call, achieve outstanding results in revolution and production, and fulfill the new battle tasks set by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party for us poor and lower-middle peasants!

    为我们贫下中农除了一大害
    青海省西宁郊区马场公社毛胜寺大队全体贫下中农
    春雷一声震天响，党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报传四方。我们毛胜寺大队全体贫下中农听到这个特大喜讯后，无比兴奋，无比激动。我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    刘少奇是埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼，是党内最大的走资派。毛主席亲自主持召开的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。这个决议表达了我们广大贫下中农的心愿，搬掉了压在我们身上的一块大石头，为我们贫下中农除了一大害，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！
    解放前，我们毛胜寺大队贫下中农受尽了地主、富农的剥削和压迫，是毛主席他老人家把我们从水深火热的苦难日子里救了出来。没有毛主席，就没有我们贫下中农的今天。可是，正当我们沿着毛主席他老人家指引的人民公社这条社会主义康庄大道胜利前进的时候，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，却在农村大刮“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”的黑风，地主、富农乘机反攻倒算，把一个社会主义农村搞得乌烟瘴气，集体经济遭到了破坏。我们恨透了这个叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。如果他的阴谋得逞，我们还得吃二遍苦。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们毛胜寺大队广大贫下中农，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，起来造了党内一小撮走资派的反，把被刘少奇在农村的代理人篡夺的那部分领导权，重新夺回到我们贫下中农手里。阶级斗争实践教育了我们，使我们认识到，刘少奇是我们贫下中农不共戴天的死对头。两年多来，我们大队广大贫下中农，在毛主席关于文化大革命的一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，深入持久地开展了革命大批判，用活生生的事实，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货批得臭不可闻，大大促进了人的思想革命化。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立”。我们大队不到一年就发生了天翻地覆的变化。现在，社员一心为公，热爱集体的事迹层出不穷。今年我们队里的粮食比去年增产百分之四十七，全队总收入增长百分之七十，水利建设工程等于解放后十八年的总和。
    我们大队全体贫下中农向毛主席表决心：坚决响应您的伟大号召，以革命和生产的优异成绩，落实党的第八届扩大的十二中全会对我们贫下中农提出的新的战斗任务！
