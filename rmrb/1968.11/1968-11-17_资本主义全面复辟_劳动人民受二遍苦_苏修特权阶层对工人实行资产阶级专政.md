The Soviet revisionist privileged stratum is implementing bourgeois dictatorship in Soviet factories, mines, and enterprises, subjecting the broad masses of laboring people to persecution and suppression for the slightest expression of dissatisfaction with factory bosses.

According to Soviet revisionist newspapers, after a man named Yofe seized control of a factory in Chelyabinsk, all sorts of abominable phenomena appeared in the factory. A first-class driver named Braven, who had been working in the factory since its inception, expressed some dissatisfaction. The factory head, with the assistance of the factory trade union committee, began to persecute him, fabricating a report that Braven was "unfit for work," canceling his bonus, and threatening to give him a bad evaluation.

A grinder named Lachlov had long been considered one of the factory's outstanding workers. Simply because he criticized the factory director and some foremen, the factory management issued him a warning and immediately canceled his bonus. Fitters Gorbinko, Nesteroff, and Skrebkov also had their bonuses canceled for the same reason.

In this factory, anyone who did not please the factory director was subject to persecution.

An electric welder named Zaporojez exposed and criticized Yofe several times at meetings, which terrified the factory director, who threatened him, saying: "Submit your resignation, we can't work together." Zaporojez was thus dismissed. These examples fully illustrate that in the Soviet Union, the working class, which has lost power, has even been deprived of the right to speak.

Some officials in this factory who dared to stand on the side of the broad masses of workers also suffered brutal suppression from the factory privileged stratum.

The head of the planning department, Sherstianko, publicly criticized the factory director for abusing his authority, and as a result, Sherstianko was listed as an "unfit person" and began to be persecuted. The factory director collected various reports and threatened to fire him.

The factory trade union secretary and engineer Antonova disagreed with the false report of the factory trade union committee and refused to sign it. After some time, Antonova had a conversation with the factory director Yofe. The factory director threatened her, saying: "Submit your resignation, I can't work with you." Antonova refused the director's shameless threats, and as a result, she was subjected to slander and harassment everywhere.

In this factory, the persecution of workers reached a shocking degree. According to Soviet publications, 80% of the workers were fired within a year. This fully exposed the crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in brutally persecuting the working class.

In today's Soviet Union, workers have nowhere to turn with their grievances. They suffer persecution from the factory privileged stratum, and when they appeal to higher authorities, they only suffer greater persecution.

A fitter named Putiato in the repair machinery workshop of the Svetlogorsk Pulp and Paper Combine could not tolerate the privileged elements in the factory abusing their authority and engaging in corruption. He exposed this at a factory trade union representative meeting. The privileged elements of the combine then began a long-term, meticulously planned persecution of Putiato.

Putiato wrote to a newspaper about these circumstances. The newspaper forwarded the letter to the Soviet revisionist-controlled Wood, Paper, and Wood Processing Industry Workers' Union. The union's regional committee sent a technical inspector to the combine, who, in collaboration with the factory privileged elements, subjected Putiato to brutal persecution.

This technical inspector, upon arriving at the combine, immediately called Putiato and some workers to the privileged elements of the combine for interrogation. The result was a completely distorted conclusion, openly exonerating the privileged elements.

The Soviet revisionist authorities' protection of the privileged elements became a signal for the intensified persecution of Putiato. The privileged elements of this combine became even more brazen, even wanting to "pursue" Putiato's alleged responsibility for slander, and one persecution after another fell upon this worker.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's full-scale restoration of capitalism at home is increasingly arousing strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. The various persecutions of the Soviet revisionist traitors cannot intimidate or subdue the Soviet people, who have a glorious tradition of the October Revolution. On the contrary, they can only further prompt the Soviet people to rise up and fight against the traitors like Brezhnev and Kosygin.

### 资本主义全面复辟  劳动人民受二遍苦　苏修特权阶层对工人实行资产阶级专政

　　资本主义全面复辟  劳动人民受二遍苦
　　苏修特权阶层对工人实行资产阶级专政
    新华社十六日讯　苏修特权阶层在苏联厂矿企业对广大劳动人民实行资产阶级专政，许多职工只要稍微对工厂头目表示不满，就要遭到种种迫害和打击。
  据苏修报纸透露，在车里雅宾斯克一家工厂的大权被一个名叫约费的特权分子篡夺以后，工厂里出现了许许多多乌七八糟的现象。从建厂起就在这个工厂工作的一级司机布拉文，发表了一些不满的意见。于是，工厂的头目在工厂的工会委员会协助下开始迫害他，制造了一个关于布拉文“工作不称职”的报告，取消了给他的奖金，威胁要给他做坏的鉴定。
    磨工拉奇洛夫长期以来一直被认为是这个工厂的优秀工人之一。仅仅由于他批评了厂长和某些工长，厂方就对他提出警告，立即取消了他的奖金。钳工戈尔宾科、涅斯捷罗夫、斯克列勃科夫等，也由于同样原因，被取消了奖金。
    在这个工厂里，谁要不合厂长的意，谁就要遭到迫害。
    电焊工扎波罗热茨在几次会上对厂长约费进行了揭发和批判，这使得厂长怕得要命，威胁他说：你送份辞职申请吧，咱俩干不到一块儿。扎波罗热茨就这样被开除了。这些例子充分说明，在苏联，失掉了政权的工人阶级，连说句话的权利都被剥夺了。
    这个工厂一些敢于站在广大工人一边的干部，也遭到了工厂特权阶层的残酷打击。
    计划科科长谢尔坚科公开指责了厂长擅用职权，这下子谢尔坚科就被列入了“不合适人员”的名单，开始被迫害。厂长搜集各种报告，威胁要解雇他。
    这个厂的工会秘书、工艺师安东诺娃不同意厂工会委员会的假报告，拒绝在报告上签名。过了一段时间，安东诺娃和厂长约费进行了一次谈话。厂长威胁说：你交份离职申请吧，我跟你干不到一块儿。安东诺娃拒绝了厂长的无耻恫吓，于是她就到处受到诽谤和刁难。
    在这家工厂，这种对工人的名目繁多的迫害达到了十分触目惊心的程度。据苏联报刊供认，这个工厂一年内就有百分之八十的职工被解雇。这充分暴露了苏修集团残酷迫害工人阶级的罪行。
    在今天的苏联，工人有苦无处诉。他们遭到工厂特权阶层的迫害，向上级申诉，结果却是遭到更大的迫害。
    斯维托戈尔斯克纸浆造纸联合工厂修理机械车间的钳工普季亚托，看不惯工厂特权分子滥用职权，贪污腐化，他在厂工会代表会议上发言进行了揭露。于是，联合工厂特权分子就开始对普季亚托进行了一场长期的、经过周密策划的迫害。
    普季亚托把这些情况写信告诉一家报纸。报纸把信转给了苏修御用的木材、造纸和木材加工工业工人工会。工会州委会派了个技术观察员到联合工厂，配合工厂特权分子，对普季亚托进行了残酷的打击。
    这个技术观察员，来到联合工厂后，立即把普季亚托和工厂的一些工作人员叫到联合工厂特权分子面前，当面进行讯问。结果得出了一个完全颠倒黑白的结论，公开为特权分子开脱。
    苏修当局对特权分子的包庇，成了对普季亚托加紧迫害的信号。这个联合工厂的特权分子从而更加肆无忌惮起来，竟然要进一步“追究”普季亚托进行所谓诽谤的责任，迫害一个接一个地落到了这位工人的身上。
    苏修叛徒集团在国内全面复辟资本主义的倒行逆施，正引起越来越多的苏联革命人民的强烈不满和反抗。苏修叛徒们的种种迫害吓不倒、也压不服具有光荣的十月革命传统的苏联革命人民，相反，只能进一步促使苏联人民起来同勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的叛徒进行斗争。
