Under the great momentum of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, which is responsible for the heavy task of railway construction, is high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. They are vigorously responding to the great battle call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and are striving to complete the annual railway construction task ahead of schedule, to make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist construction of the motherland.

The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps. In recent days, good news has been continuously reported from various new railway lines. The progress of engineering projects in various units is making rapid strides. In the southern regions, the officers and soldiers are making the most of the good construction season, working day and night. The soldiers building bridges are taking advantage of the dry season of rivers to excavate the bridge foundations; on the tunnel construction sites, the soldiers are drilling through mountains and filling valleys, and the roar of cannons shakes the mountains. The soldiers responsible for earth and stone work are transporting soil like flying, and the roadbeds are rising from the ground. In the northern regions, the units are using the communiqué as a weapon to carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, which has promoted the progress of the projects. The main engineering projects this year have been completed ahead of schedule. In the northeastern forest areas, the construction units are actively learning, publicizing, and implementing the communiqué, and have quickly launched a production high tide. The soldiers are fighting against ice and snow in the vast forests and severe cold, and are hastening to complete the final and matching projects of the new railways this year. A section of the railway trunk line has recently been handed over to the state for operation, and trains loaded with materials are entering the depths of the forest despite the falling snow. The various ethnic peoples living in the forest see the new leap in national industrial construction and shout enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is the greatest!"

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great thought of Mao Zedong has further armed the broad masses of officers and soldiers, accelerated the ideological revolution of the people, and become a great driving force for the progress of the projects. The soldiers resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility and abundant political enthusiasm, they bravely fight against the heavens and the earth, overcome various difficulties, and achieve victory. In a certain place in North China, the unit excavating the tunnel encountered a situation where the tunnel became an "underground river" with six thousand tons of water flowing out in one day and night in late August this year. Faced with this difficulty, the officers and soldiers carried out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's "philosophy of survival" and "theory of merging public and private interests." The soldiers, with hatred towards Liu Shaoqi, worked where the water was deep. The surging underground water was ice-cold, and everyone fought tenaciously in the water, finally overcoming the difficulties and completing the task. A certain unit was ordered to build a large bridge in the severe cold of the northeastern forest area at the beginning of this year. At that time, the temperature dropped to minus thirty or forty degrees, and the rivers were frozen solid, making it difficult to construct. The leaders at all levels followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience," mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and solutions. The soldiers erected Chairman Mao's portrait and Mao Zedong Thought slogans in the snow, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, pooled their wisdom and overcame one technical difficulty after another, successfully building the bridge.

The Party committees, political organs, and broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps are implementing Chairman Mao's military thought, focusing on grassroots construction, and greatly enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops. The leading organ of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, following Chairman Mao's teaching on maintaining close ties with the masses, went deep into the grassroots, strengthened leadership, and promoted the leapfrog progress of the projects. After completing the third quarter's tasks ahead of schedule, they completed the tasks for October ahead of schedule. The broad masses of cadres went to the construction sites and appeared among the soldiers as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the soldiers, always maintaining close ties with the masses. The commander of a certain regiment often went deep into the construction sites to direct the construction. Where there were difficulties, he appeared there. Once, when underground water surged into the tunnel, he jumped into the water over a meter deep with the soldiers to dig and push the cart, and together they found a way to overcome the difficulties.

The various units of the Railway Corps are also implementing Chairman Mao's teaching that "proletarian politics must take command, and follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers," and are continuously promoting technical personnel from among the old workers and soldiers. These comrades, with their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, are constantly striving for technical excellence, realizing many technical innovations, and promoting the rapid progress of the projects. On various construction sites, many young technical personnel who graduated from colleges and universities are criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, humbly learning from the soldiers, and changing their worldview through labor. Some of them have been rated as active learners of Chairman Mao's works, and many have made inventions and creations in engineering technology, solving some "old and difficult" problems in construction.

The various units of the Railway Corps are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "promote revolution through thrift," and have launched a mass movement for increased production and thrift. A certain regiment constructing in a certain mountainous area in the southwest is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation, and cement could not be supplied in time. The soldiers found ways and means locally, taking materials from the mountains with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong. Once, they split a nearly three-zhang-high solitary rock into more than six thousand small pieces of material, which were used to build the side walls and piers of the tunnel, ensuring the progress of the project and saving a large amount of cement.

Currently, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps are, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," rallying even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and striving to achieve the great task proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "We must grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness, and build our socialist industry, socialist agriculture, and all socialist undertakings even more excellently."

    在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势鼓舞下　为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献力量
    铁道兵部队战斗在南北各地加紧修建铁路
    广大指战员以十二中全会公报为武器，深入开展革命大批判，推动了工程进展，他们决心提前完成全年铁路修建任务
    新华社二十二日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的大好形势鼓舞下，担负着繁重的铁路修建任务的中国人民解放军铁道兵部队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热烈响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大战斗号召，在南北各地各条新建铁路线上，意气风发、斗志昂扬地掀起了轰轰烈烈的抓革命促生产的新高潮。广大指战员决心提前完成全年铁路修建任务，为无产阶级文化大革命和祖国的社会主义建设事业立新功。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，极大地鼓舞了铁道兵广大指战员的革命热情。连日来，各条新建铁路线捷报频传，各部队的工程进度都在突飞猛进。在南方各地，指战员们正在利用施工的大好季节，日夜奋战。修桥的战士们趁江河枯水时期，加紧开挖桥梁基础；在隧道工地上，战士们穿山凿洞，劈岭填谷，隆隆炮声震撼着群山。担负土石方作业的战士们，运土如飞，一段段路基平地而起。在华北地区施工的部队，以全会公报为武器，深入开展对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判，推动了工程进展，今年的主要工程项目已经提前完成。在东北林区，施工部队积极地学习、宣传、落实公报，迅速掀起生产高潮。战士们在林海雪原战冰雪、斗严寒，加紧进行今年新建铁路的收尾配套工程。有一段铁路干线已在最近交付国家运营，满载物资的列车，冒着飘飘大雪，开进密林深处。居住在森林里的各族人民，看到国家工业建设新的飞跃景象，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想进一步武装了广大指战员，加速了人的思想革命化，成为推动工程进展的巨大动力。战士们坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，以高度的革命责任感和饱满的政治热情，英勇无畏地战天斗地，战胜各种困难夺取胜利。在华北某地开挖隧道的部队，今年八月下旬，碰到洞内出水，一昼夜要流出六千多吨，隧道变成“地下长河”。面对这一困难，指战员们深入开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“活命哲学”、“公私溶化论”。战士们带着对刘少奇的满腔仇恨施工，那里水深，就在那里战斗。汹涌的地下水，冰冷刺骨，大家在水中顽强奋战，终于排除万难，征服大水，完成了任务。某部队今年年初奉命在严寒的东北林区修建一座大桥，当时气温降到零下三、四十度，河流冻得死死的，施工中碰到了许多困难，各级领导遵照毛主席“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导，发动群众出主意、想办法。战士们在雪地上矗立起毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，群策群力，攻克了一个又一个技术难关，胜利地建成了大桥。
    铁道兵各部队党委、政治机关和广大指战员，遵照毛主席的建军思想，狠抓基层建设，极大地提高了部队的战斗力。铁道兵某部队领导机关遵照毛主席关于密切联系群众的教导，深入基层，加强领导，推动了工程跃进，在全面超额完成第三季度的任务后，十月份又提前完成了任务。广大干部纷纷走上工地，以普通劳动者的身份出现在战士们中间，和战士们同吃同住同劳动，始终保持着和群众的密切联系。某部团长经常深入工地指挥施工，那里有困难，就在那里出现，有次隧道里涌出地下水，他和战士们一起跳到一米多深的水中扒碴、推车，一起想办法战胜了困难。
    铁道兵各部队还遵照毛主席“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的教导，不断地从老工人和战士中提拔工程技术干部。这些同志怀着对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，在技术上不断攀登高峰，实现了许多技术革新项目，推动了工程的突飞猛进。在各个工地上，许多从大专院校毕业的青年技术人员，遵照毛主席的“由工农兵给他们以再教育”的教导，批判了叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，虚心向战士们学习，在劳动中改造世界观。他们有的被评为学习毛主席著作积极分子，不少人在工程技术方面还有所发明创造，解决了施工中的一些“老大难”问题。
    铁道兵各部队在施工中，积极响应毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，掀起了群众性的增产节约运动。在西南某山区施工的某团，地处偏僻，交通不便，水泥一时供应不上，战士们就多方设法，就地取材，他们以愚公移山的革命精神，劈山开石，开采出料石三千多立方米。有一次，他们把一个近三丈高的大孤石，劈成六千多块小料石，用来砌筑隧道的边墙和桥墩，既保证了工程进度，又节约了大量水泥。
    目前，铁道兵部队的广大指战员，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足更大的革命干劲，为实现党的八届十二中全会提出的“我们必须抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，把我国的社会主义工业、社会主义农业和一切社会主义事业建设得更加出色”的伟大任务而努力奋斗。
