Inspired by the communiqué, a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is sweeping across the Bengbu Railway Bureau. The revolutionary and production situation is better than ever.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: The workers of the Bengbu Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's directive to "fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," are vigorously promoting revolution and production. In September and October, they completed their transportation and production tasks ahead of schedule. Currently, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau are launching a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. The revolutionary and production situation is better than ever.

The workers of the Bengbu Railway Bureau, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters. They have achieved new victories in both revolution and production. After Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that the working class must lead everything, the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau were filled with joy and immediately sent their outstanding representatives to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They marched into schools, offices, and hospitals, and ascended the political stage of the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure. After sending twenty outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the workers of the Bengbu Rolling Stock Section, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, mobilized all positive factors. Despite the heavy tasks, poor equipment, and lack of personnel, they successfully completed all production tasks. This year, the state assigned this section the task of inspecting 4,000 cars. From January to the end of July, they completed 1,935 cars. In September, all revolutionary workers of the section launched a competition to learn from each other, help each other, and strive to complete the task of inspecting 1,052 cars in one month, setting a new record. The workers of the 1075 locomotive of the Bengbu Locomotive Section, upon hearing that their outstanding representatives went to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations and saw the great leader Chairman Mao whom they had longed for day and night, were filled with excitement. They broke through the unreasonable rules and regulations that had previously constrained the workers, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to venture and daring to do, and created a historical record of pulling 113 cars weighing 6,500 tons from Bengbu to Pukou. Due to the surge of vigorously promoting revolution and production across the entire bureau, the phenomenon of vehicle backlog and line blockage has been completely overcome. Under the efforts of the revolutionary workers, this railway bureau completed 1,027,000 tons of cargo in September, an increase of 81% compared to the average monthly cargo volume in the first half of the year; in October, the cargo volume increased by 7.2% compared to September. The transportation volume of major materials such as coal, oil, steel, and fertilizers increased by one to four times compared to the first half of the year.

Currently, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the workers and revolutionary cadres of the Bengbu Railway Bureau are launching a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. The revolutionary workers are also combining the revolutionary criticism with the work of cleaning up the class ranks to root out the handful of class enemies hidden among the masses. They are determined to push the struggle, criticism, and reform of the entire bureau to a new high, and to strive with all their might to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.
