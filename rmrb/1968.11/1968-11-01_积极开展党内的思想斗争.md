Actively Carry Out Ideological Struggle Within the Party

	Certain Regiment Sixth Company Political Instructor Wang Weige

	The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the "theory of intra-party peace," promoting liberalism and conciliation, and slandering intra-party struggle as "deliberately seeking 'objects of struggle,'" as "creating trouble out of nothing." This is sheer nonsense!

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The contradiction between correct and erroneous ideas in the Party... is a reflection within the Party of class contradictions as long as classes exist." The entire history of our Party's struggle and the great practice of the Cultural Revolution tell us: as long as there are classes and class struggle in society, there must be opposition and struggle between the two lines within the Party. The "theory of intra-party peace" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy. In today's world where class struggle is sharp and complex, intra-party peace is not only a deception but also something that does not exist in the minds of every Party member. Communist Party members do not live in a vacuum; the sharp and complex class struggle in society is constantly reflected in the minds of Party members.

	In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev stirred up the capitalist black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" in the countryside. This black wind quickly reflected in our company through various channels. Some Party members developed some confused ideas. A Party member from a poor peasant background even had the idea of returning home to farm his private plot. Obviously, if such thoughts are allowed to exist and develop in the minds of Party members, then our Party members will deviate from the revolutionary path of the proletariat, deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, and even degenerate and change quality. Should we allow the capitalist thoughts of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" to corrupt our Party members, or should we use Mao Zedong Thought to resist and criticize these capitalist thoughts? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the Party and revolutionary organizations for the sake of combat. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary should take up this weapon." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we first conducted class education among Party members, organized Party members to visit the poor and ask about their hardships, recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and organized a discussion throughout the company on "whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road." This discussion ignited the fuse of class struggle in the depths of everyone's soul and opened up the battlefield of class struggle in their minds. During the discussion, the Party member who had wanted to return home to farm his private plot linked his family's tragic experience of begging for three generations in the old society, deeply criticizing his own forgetful thoughts. He said excitedly: "Chairman Mao saved my whole family from the abyss of suffering, but I wanted to jump back into it, which is very dangerous." He vowed to follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist path to the end. Later, he actively mobilized his family to return the private plot to the commune.

	In recent years, we have actively carried out ideological struggle within the Party, continuously raising the awareness of line struggle among all Party members, strengthening the role of the Party branch as a fortress, and leading the entire company of cadres and soldiers to create a "four good" company for seven consecutive years.

	Facts have proven that intra-party struggle is objectively existent and does not change with people's will. To abolish intra-party struggle is to remove the soul of Chairman Mao's line of building the Party, to allow the bourgeois worldview to reform the proletarian party, and to make our Party degenerate into a tool for restoring capitalism. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of intra-party peace," actively carry out intra-party struggle, and engage in unending combat with all class enemies, all erroneous lines, and all bourgeois ideas, so that our Party organization will always be full of vitality and forever maintain revolutionary youth.

    积极开展党内的思想斗争
    某部六连指导员　王卫革
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹“党内和平论”，宣扬自由主义、调和主义，诬蔑党内斗争是“故意去寻找‘斗争对象’”，是“平地起风波”。真是一派胡言！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“共产党内正确思想和错误思想的矛盾，……在阶级存在的时候，这是阶级矛盾对于党内的反映。”我们党的全部斗争历史和无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践告诉我们：只要社会上存在阶级和阶级斗争，党内就必然存在两条路线的对立和斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“党内和平论”是一种彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义谬论。在阶级斗争尖锐存在的今天，党内和平不仅是一种欺骗，就是每个党员的头脑里也毫无和平可言。共产党员不是生活在真空里，社会上尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，随时都要反映到党员头脑中来。
    一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫在农村刮起了“三自一包”的资本主义黑风。这股黑风通过各种渠道很快就反映到我们连队。有的党员产生了一些糊涂观念。一个贫农出身的党员竟一度产生了想回家种自留地的念头。显然，如果让这种思想在党员头脑中存在和发展下去，那么，我们的党员就要离开无产阶级革命的轨道，离开毛泽东思想的轨道，甚至蜕化变质。是让中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”的资本主义思想来腐蚀我们的党员呢，还是用毛泽东思想来抵制、批判这种资本主义思想呢？毛主席教导我们：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。每个共产党员和革命分子，应该拿起这个武器。”遵照毛主席这一教导，我们首先在党员中进行了阶级教育，组织党员访贫问苦，忆苦思甜，并在全连组织了“走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路”的讨论，启发大家在灵魂深处点燃阶级斗争的导火索，在头脑里开辟阶级斗争的战场。讨论中，那个曾想回家种自留地的共产党员联系旧社会全家三代要饭的悲惨遭遇，深刻批判了自己的忘本思想。他激动地说：“毛主席把我全家从火坑里救出来，我却又要往火坑里跳，真是太危险了。”他表示一定要跟着毛主席沿着社会主义的大道走到底。事后，他积极动员家里把自留地交回了公社。
    几年来我们积极开展了党内思想斗争，使全体党员不断提高路线斗争觉悟，加强了党支部的战斗堡垒作用，带领全连干部战士连续七年创造了四好连队。
    事实证明，党内斗争是客观存在的，是不依人们的意志为转移的，取消党内斗争，就是抽掉毛主席建党路线的灵魂，就是纵容资产阶级世界观来改造无产阶级的政党，使我们的党蜕变成复辟资本主义的工具。因此，我们必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“党内和平论”，积极开展党内斗争，和一切阶级敌人，一切错误路线，一切资产阶级思想进行永不停息的战斗，使我们的党组织永远朝气蓬勃，永葆革命的青春。
