Ambassador Vasili Nataneli of the People's Republic of Albania spoke at the reception celebrating the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation. His speech is as follows:

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrade Kang Sheng, Dear Comrade Yao Wenyuan, Dear Comrade Xie Fuzhi, Dear Comrades and Esteemed Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today, the Albanian people, laden with new victories, solemnly celebrate the great day of national liberation and social liberation—the 29th of November. We express our heartfelt thanks for your attendance at this reception. At this moment, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao Zedong have triumphed in China, we are particularly delighted to celebrate this glorious day of the Albanian people together with our Chinese brothers, our ever-loyal and close comrades-in-arms.

In these days, we have seen that the activities celebrating the glorious day of the Albanian people are imbued with the powerful feelings of fraternal friendship, respect, and internationalist solidarity that the Chinese people hold for the Albanian people, the Albanian Party of Labour, and their beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. We are very pleased about this.

Please allow me to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Party of Labour, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, our deepest gratitude to the loyal ally of the Albanian people, the great Chinese people, to the glorious Communist Party of China, and to the most esteemed friend of the Albanian people, the great leader Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai. At the same time, we extend our warmest and most cordial congratulations on the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the triumph of the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding fighter for the cause of socialism and communism.

Dear Comrades and Friends,

After waging a great people's war against the fascist occupiers and traitors, our people achieved liberation on November 29, 1944, and established their own people's government through revolution. The glorious day of the Albanian people has now been celebrated for 24 years. These have been 24 years of heroic struggle for the construction of socialism, for the defense of the victories of the people's revolution, for the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Albania, for the smashing of one plot after another by the imperialists, revisionists, and internal enemies of the People's Republic of Albania, and for the defense of the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The victories achieved by our people in the national liberation and in these 24 years are brilliant. These victories are due to the revolutionary enthusiasm of our working masses and to the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Albania, once a slave, semi-colonial country, a commodity in the hands of the imperialists, is today a free, socialist, independent, and sovereign state. There, the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, invincible and flying in the wind; there, the people are masters of their own affairs, building socialism with their own hands, and advancing towards new victories in all aspects of life. Industrial output has increased more than fortyfold compared to 1938, and agricultural output has tripled. Throughout Albania, many new integrated factories, mines, and light and heavy industrial plants have been built. Large hydroelectric and thermal power stations have been completed and are being rapidly constructed. Our socialist agriculture is also developing victoriously. The victories in education, culture, and art are equally brilliant, becoming the wealth of the broad masses of workers. Due to these developments, the welfare of the people has been improved.

Today, in the entire socialist Albania, a great mass revolutionary movement is vigorously unfolding in the ideological and cultural spheres. In the spirit of the historic decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and the programmatic teachings of Comrade Hoxha, the consciousness and worldview of the working masses are being further revolutionized to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. Our socialist revolution is entering a new, higher stage. The characteristic of this stage is the launching of a fierce offensive against all the remnants of the old society, the display of unprecedented great enthusiasm in labor, and the participation of the working masses and our heroic youth in various forms of voluntary labor.

The international prestige of the People's Republic of Albania has been greatly enhanced. The principled stand of socialist Albania has been admired and praised by the revolutionary peoples of the world, first and foremost the great people of China numbering 700 million. We have forged a close, eternal friendship with the Chinese people.

Our people are deeply concerned and sympathetic towards the comprehensive victories achieved by the People's Republic of China under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, in the revolution and production.

The 700 million Chinese people are living in a strong revolutionary atmosphere. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong has mobilized the entire creative power of the great Chinese people, and this revolution has achieved brilliant, decisive victories. Except for Taiwan, which is temporarily occupied by imperialism, revolutionary committees have been successfully established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, marking the brilliant victory of the proletarian line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. It is under such excellent conditions that the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held and successfully concluded. The historic Marxist-Leninist decisions of this plenary session have been warmly welcomed by workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals. The expulsion of Liu Shaoqi from the Party and the revocation of all his posts have completely and thoroughly destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by this traitor and sworn enemy of the Communist Party of China and the people. The conspiracy of imperialism and revisionism to seize the fortress from within and carry out revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China has also failed and been buried.

The historic decisions of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao, have become the wealth of the broad masses of workers, a great guiding principle for better completing the tasks of the new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to its final victory, and for making the People's Republic of China a great fortress of socialism and the world proletarian revolution. The convening of the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will undoubtedly open up new, more brilliant prospects for achieving greater victories on the road to socialism and communism.

Great China, the red China of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, a powerful and reliable defender of the revolutionary peoples of all countries who are fighting for freedom and national independence. The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary alliance of the Soviet and American imperialists. The proletarian revolutionary factions of all countries and the progressive humanity of the whole world are looking towards great socialist China. This is a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism. Today, the banner of Marxism-Leninism is proudly flying in China, pure and untainted. This is a historic merit of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong himself. Therefore, all true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries in the world highly value the great role of the Communist Party of China and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong.

The people of our country, the Albanian Party of Labour, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania sincerely congratulate and support the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people, regarding them as our own victories and victories for the world revolutionary cause. We believe that the fraternal Chinese people, armed with the Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao, under the tested leadership of the Communist Party of China, will certainly achieve new and even greater victories, will march forward courageously, will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and will create new miracles on the fronts of production, education, culture, science, and technology. The People's Republic of China will forever be an important factor in the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples and nations, and an important factor in defending revolution and Marxism-Leninism.

Dear Comrades and Friends,

The current development of the international situation is favorable to the revolution, to socialism, and to the revolutionary forces struggling for national liberation and social liberation, and is unfavorable to imperialism, modern revisionism, and international reactionaries. A new stage of struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists has begun. The tide of national liberation struggles is surging higher and higher. The scale of workers' and students' revolutionary struggles in capitalist countries is expanding. The forces of Marxism-Leninism are growing stronger and stronger. The peoples of all countries are increasingly believing that armed struggle is the only correct and reliable way to thoroughly defeat the imperialists and their running dogs. The revisionists of the Khrushchev clique are experiencing a serious crisis. They are fighting among themselves, the strong preying on the weak.

The fascist aggression against Czechoslovakia has thoroughly exposed the true colors of the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique, proving that they are traitors to Marxism-Leninism and suppressors of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries.

At this critical moment, under the correct policy of our Party, the People's Republic of Albania has made a decision of great domestic and international significance. Our Party and government have publicly condemned the fascist attack on Czechoslovakia and expressed internationalist solidarity with the people of Czechoslovakia. At the same time, our country has solemnly declared its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact because this pact has become an instrument of aggression serving the Soviet revisionist leadership. The entire people of Albania, young and old, enthusiastically support this historic decision, considering it a necessary and timely revolutionary measure.

The great leader of the fraternal Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai have given the strongest support and highest evaluation to the decision to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. In their telegram of September 17, they said, "This is another heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and a great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the Soviet revisionist renegade clique." This further enhances the great historical significance of the measures taken by our Party and government and makes our entire people feel jubilant.

The American imperialists and Soviet revisionists are coordinating their strategies and tactics, trying to maintain "peace" in Europe, while igniting fires of war in Asia against the freedom and independence of the peoples of sovereign states.

Their main goal is to encircle great China, because China has become a giant of the contemporary world, a steadfast defender of the freedom of the peoples of all countries; she does not fear the American imperialists, nor does she fear the running dogs of the Khrushchev revisionists; she has thoroughly broken the nuclear monopoly of the Americans and Soviets and is smashing their counter-revolutionary collusion. If they dare to launch any military adventure against China, they will face annihilation.

The American imperialists and Soviet revisionists have been trying to sabotage the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, attempting to bring the solution of the Vietnamese problem into the orbit of American-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. This is a dangerous plot and trap for the fate of the Vietnamese people. The only path to victory is the armed struggle that the Vietnamese people have already chosen. We have supported and will always support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to drive out the American aggressors, liberate the South, and reunify the country. In the Middle East, the goal of the American-Soviet collusion is to force the Arab countries to accept a "peaceful solution" that serves the interests of the Israeli aggressors and the global hegemony plans of the American and Soviet imperialists. We believe that the just cause of the fraternal Arab peoples will certainly triumph.

The aggression against Vietnam, Czechoslovakia, the Middle East, and other regions are links in the same chain and part of the strategic composition of the American-Soviet counter-revolutionary collusion. After the infamous Glassboro talks, this collusion has become even tighter. Therefore, today the peoples of all countries are directing their struggle against this conspiracy that threatens their freedom and sovereignty. In this struggle, great China stands at the forefront, being the main obstacle to the realization of these evil conspiracies. The failure of the imperialists and revisionists is inevitable.

The People's Republic of Albania will forever remain vigilant, brave, and principled in its revolutionary foreign policy, defending the supreme interests of the motherland. At the same time, it will resolutely oppose any aggression and oppression by the old and new colonialists and firmly support the struggle of the peoples of all countries for freedom and independence.

Dear Comrades,

The fraternal, combat-friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation between our two peoples and countries are developing and growing stronger day by day. Our friendship is indestructible and eternal because the lofty principles on which it is based are indestructible and eternal. The immortal Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism are the cornerstones of this friendship. Our two Marxist-Leninist parties, our outstanding leaders Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, have tempered this friendship in the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, in the construction of socialism, and in the defense of the purity of Marxism-Leninism. It is strengthened more and more on our eternal revolutionary march forward. The Albanian people and the great Chinese people cherish this deep, brilliant, and indestructible friendship as they would their own eyes and, for the interests of our two peoples and the world revolutionary cause, temper and strengthen this friendship more and more.

On the basis of this great, combat-friendly relationship, the sincere, fraternal cooperation and completely friendly, internationalist mutual assistance between our two parties, countries, and peoples are developing victoriously. Our two parties, countries, and peoples have completely identical views on all contemporary political issues and all issues of the international communist movement. China provides Albania with invaluable economic and technical assistance in a truly fraternal, internationalist spirit and resolute support on the international stage. For this, we are deeply grateful to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the most esteemed friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong. The Albanian people are proud to have the Chinese people as a friend who shares weal and woe and cherish the friendship with the Chinese people as they would the most precious thing. We are comrades-in-arms of the same ideal, united with each other like steel, and no force in the world can separate us.

Our two parties, countries, have declared: Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries must count China and Albania together. This is a serious warning to our enemies. If they dare to touch us, they must consider this. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "If you invade our borders, you must understand that to aid socialist Albania in defending itself, there are no borders." The very ardent words of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai most highly embody the internationalist support for the Albanian people and the People's Republic of Albania. They said: "If the American imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their running dogs dare to touch a single hair of Albania, awaiting them will only be a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." These words have powerfully struck the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries.

No matter what happens in the world, our two parties, peoples, and countries will forever stand together, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposing imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists, and the international reactionaries. We will march forward firmly and unyieldingly on the glorious path of revolution and socialism.

Please allow me to raise my glass:

To the indestructible great friendship between Albania and China,
To the great, heroic people of China numbering 700 million,
To the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
To the glorious Communist Party of China and its great leader, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, and most esteemed friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong,
To Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To the Government of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Zhou Enlai,
To Comrade Kang Sheng,
To Comrade Yao Wenyuan,
To Comrade Xie Fuzhi,
To the beloved leader of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, and the most intimate friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha,
To the health of the diplomatic envoys of all countries and their spouses,
To the health of all guests present,

Cheers!

    纳塔奈利大使在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年招待会上讲话
    中国文化大革命沉重打击了苏美反革命联盟  建立在马列主义基础上的阿中友谊牢不可破
    新华社二十九日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻华大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的姚文元同志，亲爱的谢富治同志，亲爱的同志们和尊贵的朋友们，女士们，先生们：
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民满载新的胜利，隆重庆祝民族解放和社会解放的伟大节日——十一月二十九日。对你们光临这个招待会，我们谨表示最衷心的感谢。正当无产阶级文化大革命、毛泽东主席的伟大的马克思列宁主义的思想在中国取得了胜利的时候，我们能同我们的中国兄弟、我们永远忠诚的亲密战友一起欢庆阿尔巴尼亚人民这一光荣的节日，感到莫大的喜悦。
    这几天，我们看到，在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民这一光辉节日的活动中，有力地洋溢着中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民，对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志所怀有的深厚的战斗友谊、尊敬和国际主义团结的高尚感情。对此，我们感到十分高兴。
    请允许我借此机会代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的忠实盟友、伟大的中国人民，向光荣的中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的最尊贵的朋友、伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，林彪副主席，中华人民共和国政府和周恩来同志，表示最深切的感谢。同时，向他们表示最热烈和最亲切的祝贺，祝贺无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，祝贺以社会主义和共产主义事业的杰出战士毛主席为代表的革命路线的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，
    我国人民在进行了反对法西斯占领者和卖国贼的伟大人民战争以后，于一九四四年十一月二十九日获得了解放，并通过革命建立了自己的人民政权。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的这一光辉节日已经二十四周年了。这是为社会主义建设，为保卫人民革命的胜利果实，为在阿尔巴尼亚巩固和加强无产阶级专政，为粉碎帝国主义者、修正主义者和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的内部敌人的一个又一个的阴谋，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而进行英勇斗争的二十四年。我国人民在国家解放以及这二十四年中所取得的胜利是辉煌的。这些胜利归功于我国劳动群众的革命干劲，归功于以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的马克思列宁主义的正确领导。
    曾经是受奴役的、半殖民地的、作为帝国主义者手中商品的阿尔巴尼亚，今天是一个自由的、社会主义的、独立的和主权的国家。在那里，战无不胜的伟大的马克思列宁主义旗帜迎风飘扬；在那里，人民当家作主，自力更生地建设着社会主义，在生活的各个方面朝着新的胜利永远向前迈进。工业产值比一九三八年增长了四十多倍，农业产值增长了三倍。阿尔巴尼亚全国各地新建了许多联合工厂、矿井和轻重工业工厂。建成和正在迅速建设巨大的水电站和热电厂。我国的社会主义农业也在胜利地发展。在教育、文化和艺术战线上的胜利也是如此辉煌，它们正日益成为广大劳动群众的财富。由于这些发展，人民的福利也有了提高。
    今天，在整个社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，正在蓬蓬勃勃地进一步开展思想、文化领域里的大规模的群众革命运动。根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决定和霍查同志的纲领性教导的精神，劳动群众的觉悟和世界观正在进一步革命化，以便防止产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的一切可能。我国的社会主义革命正进入一个更新、更高的阶段。这个阶段的特点是，向旧社会的一切残余发起猛攻，在劳动中发扬空前巨大的干劲，劳动群众和我们英勇的青年开展各种义务劳动。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际威望有了极大的提高。社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的始终不渝的原则立场，受到世界各国革命人民，首先是伟大的七亿中国人民的敬佩和赞扬。我们同中国人民结成了亲密的、永恒的友谊。
    我国人民怀着十分关切和同情的心情，注视着中华人民共和国在以中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下在革命和生产中取得的全面胜利。
    七亿中国人民生活在强烈的革命气氛中。
    毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命调动了伟大的中国人民的全部创造力，这场革命已经取得了决定性的光辉胜利。除了暂时还被帝国主义占领的台湾以外，所有省、市、自治区都胜利地建立了革命委员会，这是以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级路线的光辉胜利。正是在这样的大好形势下，举行了中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会，并胜利闭幕了。这次全会的马克思列宁主义的历史性决定，受到了工农兵、革命干部、红卫兵和革命知识分子的最热烈的欢迎。把刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其一切职务，这就完全、彻底地摧毁了以这个中国共产党的和人民的叛徒、死敌为代表的资产阶级司令部。帝国主义和修正主义企图从内部夺取堡垒，在中国搞修正主义和复辟资本主义的阴谋也破产了、被埋葬了。
    以毛主席的马克思列宁主义的思想为基础的中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的历史性决定，成了广大劳动群众的财富，成了更好地完成斗、批、改阶段新任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到最后胜利，使中华人民共和国成为社会主义和世界无产阶级革命的伟大的堡垒的伟大指针。中国共产党第九次全国代表大会的召开必将为在社会主义和共产主义道路上取得越来越大的胜利展现出新的更加光辉的远景。
    伟大的中国，无产阶级文化大革命的红色中国是马克思列宁主义的旗手，是为自由和民族独立而斗争的各国革命人民的强大而可靠的保卫者。中国文化革命的胜利是对苏美反革命联盟的沉重打击。所有国家的无产阶级革命派、整个进步人类都把眼光向着伟大的社会主义中国。这是马克思列宁主义的光辉胜利。今天，马克思列宁主义的旗帜纯洁地在中国骄傲地飘扬，这是中国共产党和毛泽东同志本人的历史性功勋。因此，全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命派都高度评价中国共产党和杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的伟大作用。
    我国人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府衷心祝贺并支持兄弟的中国人民所取得的这些光辉胜利，并把它看成是自己的胜利，是世界革命事业的胜利。我们相信，以毛主席的马克思列宁主义的思想武装起来的兄弟的中国人民，在中国共产党的久经考验的领导下，必将取得新的更加伟大的胜利，必将奋勇前进，必将把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，必将在生产、教育、文化、科学和技术战线上创造出新的奇迹。人民中国将永远是被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的十分重要的因素，是捍卫革命和马克思列宁主义的十分重要的因素。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，
    当前国际形势的发展有利于革命、有利于社会主义和正在为争取民族解放和社会解放而斗争的革命力量，而不利于帝国主义、现代修正主义和国际反动派。一个反对以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义的斗争的新阶段已经开始。民族解放斗争的浪潮正在日益高涨。资本主义国家中的工人和学生的革命斗争规模更大了。马克思列宁主义力量正在不断成长壮大。各国人民日益相信，武装斗争是彻底战胜帝国主义者及其走狗的唯一正确可靠的道路。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正经历着严重的危机。他们正在相互倾轧，弱肉强食。
    对捷克斯洛伐克进行的法西斯侵略，彻底揭穿了勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团的伪装，说明他们是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，各国人民自由和独立的镇压者。
    在这个关键时刻，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在我们党的正确政策的指引下，作出了具有重大国内意义和国际意义的决定。我们党和我国政府公开谴责对捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯的进攻，对捷克斯洛伐克人民表示了国际主义的声援。同时，我国庄严宣布退出华沙条约，因为这个条约成了为苏联修正主义领导效劳的侵略工具。阿尔巴尼亚全国人民，不分老少，都热烈拥护这一历史性的决定，认为这是一个必要的和及时的革命措施。
    兄弟的中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志、林彪同志和周恩来同志对退出华沙条约的决定，给予了最有力的支持和最高的评价。他们在九月十七日的电报中说，“这是对苏修叛徒集团的又一沉重打击，是对东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团斗争的巨大鼓舞。”这更增加了我们党和我国政府所采取的措施的伟大历史意义，使我们全国人民感到欢欣鼓舞。
    美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者协调他们的战略和策略，力图给自己保持欧洲的“和平”，而在亚洲对主权国家人民的自由和独立燃点战火。
    他们的主要目的是包围伟大的人民中国，因为人民中国成为当代的巨人，各国人民自由的坚定不移的保卫者；她既不把美帝放在话下，也不把美帝的走狗赫鲁晓夫修正主义者放在话下；她彻底打破了美帝和苏修的核垄断，并正在粉碎他们的反革命勾结的王牌。如果他们胆敢对中国进行任何军事冒险，那就必将遭到灭亡。
    美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者一直竭力破坏越南人民的英勇斗争，把越南问题的解决纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道。这对越南人民的命运来说是危险的阴谋和圈套。取得胜利的唯一道路是越南人民自己早就选择了的武装斗争。我们过去支持并将始终支持越南人民为赶走美国侵略者、实现解放南方、统一祖国的理想所进行的正义斗争。在中东，苏美勾结的目的是在于迫使阿拉伯各国接受“和平解决”以符合于以色列侵略者的利益和美帝、苏修的世界霸权的计划。我们相信，兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民的正义事业必将取得胜利。
    侵略越南、捷克斯洛伐克、中东和其他地区，是同一个链条中的环节，并成为美苏反革命勾结的战略组成部分。在臭名昭著的葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，这一勾结变得更加紧密了。因此今天各国人民把斗争矛头指向了这个危害他们自由和主权的阴谋。在这场斗争中伟大的人民中国站在最前列，她是实现这些罪恶阴谋的主要障碍。帝国主义者和修正主义者的失败是不可避免的。
　  阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国永远保持警惕、英勇无畏、奉行原则性的革命的外交政策，保卫祖国的崇高利益。同时，她永远坚决反对新老殖民主义者的任何侵略和压迫，坚决支持各国人民争取自由独立的事业和斗争。
    亲爱的同志们，
    我们两国人民、两国之间的兄弟的战斗友谊和全面合作关系，正在日益不断地发展和增长。我们的友谊是牢不可破的，永恒的，因为它所依据的崇高原则是牢不可破的，永恒的。不朽的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义是这个友谊的奠基石。我们两个马克思列宁主义的党、我们杰出的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、建设社会主义和捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的共同斗争的烈火中，锤炼了这个友谊。它在我们永远向前的革命征途中日益得到加强。阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民，象保护眼珠一样地保护这个深厚的、光辉的、牢不可破的友谊，并为我们两国人民的利益和世界革命事业的利益，日益锤炼和加强这个友谊。
    在这个伟大的战斗友谊的基础上，我们两党、两国和两国人民之间的真诚的、兄弟般的合作关系和完全友好的、国际主义的互助，正在胜利发展。我们两党、两国和两国人民，对当代的一切政治问题和国际共产主义运动的所有问题，有着完全一致的观点。中国以真正兄弟般的、国际主义的精神，给予阿尔巴尼亚十分宝贵的经济技术援助和在国际上的坚决支持。为此，我们深切感激中国人民、中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的最尊贵的朋友毛泽东同志。阿尔巴尼亚人民为有中国人民这样一个患难与共的朋友而感到自豪，并象珍惜最珍贵的东西一样，珍惜同中国人民的友谊。我们是同一理想的战友，相互之间有着钢铁般团结，世界上没有任何力量能把我们分开。
    我们两党、两国曾经宣告：帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，必须把中国和阿尔巴尼亚计算在一起。这是对我们的敌人的一个严重警告。如果它们碰一碰我们，它们就得好好考虑这一点。恩维尔·霍查同志说过：“如果你们侵犯我们的边境，你们必须懂得，为了保卫阿尔巴尼亚而给予社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的援助，就没有国界了。”毛泽东同志、林彪同志和周恩来同志的十分炽热的语言，最高度地体现了对阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际主义的支持。他们说：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”这些话有力地打击了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派。
    不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民和两个国家必将永远团结在一起，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，坚决反对以美帝为首的帝国主义，反对以苏修为首的现代修正主义和国际反动派。我们将沿着革命和社会主义的光荣大道，永远坚定不移地勇往直前。
    请允许我举杯：
    为阿中两国牢不可破的伟大友谊，
    为伟大的、英雄的七亿中国人民，
    为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，
    为光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民最尊贵的朋友毛泽东同志，
    为中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志，
    为中华人民共和国政府和周恩来同志，
    为康生同志，
    为姚文元同志，
    为谢富治同志，
    为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志，
    为各国外交使节和他们的夫人的健康，
    为在座的全体来宾的健康，
    干杯！
