Upon entering the Dan Dong Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Agricultural School, one is greeted by a dazzling array of revolutionary criticism columns. Classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls are all battlefields of criticism. The fervor of the struggle, criticism, and reform is surging, and the flames of criticism are blazing. Students can't help but praise: It's all thanks to the poor and lower-middle peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team who ignited the flames of revolutionary criticism in our hearts, opening up a new phase in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. In the past, during criticism meetings, students would just read from their prepared scripts, exposing the surface but not the core. Those above criticized, while those below caused trouble. Criticism meetings were not focused. Seeing this situation, the propaganda team members were very anxious. After conducting investigations and research, they decided to organize a new battle. Poor and lower-middle peasants led the way in fiercely exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the capitalist roaders, igniting the students' deep hatred for the class enemies.

The propaganda team brought the school's capitalist roaders to the stage. Old peasant Wang Zhen Shan, filled with hatred, denounced the traitor Liu Shaoqi's crimes. He angrily said: "In the old society, the school gates faced south, and poor children couldn't enter. Today, Chairman Mao has given us poor and lower-middle peasants the opportunity to study, but the traitor Liu Shaoqi's evil heart never dies. He stretches his black hands in again, pushing a black and poisonous counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, doing everything possible to prevent the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from going to school. What 'study to become an official' and 'achieve fame and fortune,' it's all to corrupt the souls of our poor and lower-middle peasants' children, dragging our poor and lower-middle peasants' descendants into the mire of revisionism, turning them into tools for his restoration of capitalism."

Following this, old peasant Li Zi Yi pointed at the capitalist roader's nose and fired: "You, this agent of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, are frantically peddling revisionist black goods, saying things like 'as long as you study well, you won't be sent back to the countryside to dig ditches.' 'You are all main beams, you can't be used as rafters.' Look, this is more vicious than a wolf, turning the children of poor and lower-middle peasants into those who look down on workers and peasants, despise labor, and don't recognize their parents, into foreign students. This guy is a bloodless executioner, a mortal enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants."

Seeing the capitalist roaders in front of them, the poor and lower-middle peasants were like seeing the landlords of the old society who drove their families to ruin, the more they criticized, the more energized they became. Shell after shell of heavy artillery fire tore apart the revisionist educational line, leaving the capitalist roaders trembling and exposing their ugly true colors. This battle made the revolutionary teachers and students see clearly the ferocious face of the class enemies, igniting the flames of anger in their hearts. The slogans "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" and "Eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line!" echoed through the sky.

Since then, the revolutionary teachers and students of the agricultural school have bravely charged to the forefront of revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary criticism has been carried out with great fervor. They have endless hatred to denounce the number one capitalist roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents. While criticizing the capitalist roaders, they fiercely struggle against the "self," eliminating the poison of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's revisionism.

　　宣传队点燃革命大批判烈火
    走进丹东抗大农校，革命大批判专栏琳琅满目，教室、宿舍、食堂到处都是大批判的战场，斗批改热浪滚滚，大批判烈火熊熊。同学们都赞不绝口地说：多亏贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队点燃了我们心头革命大批判的烈火，打开了学校斗批改的新局面。过去开批判会，同学们都拿着批判稿上去念，揭皮不批心，上面批，下面闹，批判会开得不集中。宣传队员们看到这种情景，心里很着急。他们经过调查研究以后，决定重新组织一场战斗。贫下中农带头狠揭狠批走资派的滔天罪行，激发学生们对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。
    宣传队把学校走资派揪到会场。老贫农王振山，怀着满腹仇恨控诉了叛徒刘少奇的罪行。他气愤地说：“旧社会，学校大门朝南开，穷人孩子进不来。今天毛主席给了俺贫下中农读书的机会，可叛徒刘少奇贼心不死，又把黑手伸进来，推行一条又黑又毒的反革命修正主义教育路线，千方百计不让贫下中农的孩子上学。什么‘读书当官’、‘成名成家’，就是要腐蚀我们贫下中农子女的灵魂，把我们贫下中农后代拉进修正主义的泥坑，变成他复辟资本主义的工具。”
    紧接着老贫农李子义指着走资派的鼻子开了炮：你这个叛徒刘少奇的代理人，拚命贩卖修正主义的黑货，胡说什么“你们只要好好读书，将来就不会叫你们回农村扒地垄沟的。”“你们都是大梁，不能当椽子用。”看，这比恶狼还要恶，把贫下中农的子女带成了轻视工农、轻视劳动、不认爹娘的洋学生。这个家伙是杀人不见血的刽子手，是俺贫下中农的死对头。
    贫下中农看到眼前的走资派，就象看到了旧社会逼得自己家破人亡的地主一样，越批越有劲。一发发重型炮弹把修正主义教育路线批得体无完肤，把走资派批得浑身发抖、丑态百出。这场战斗，使革命师生看清了阶级敌人的狰狞面目，点燃了他们心中的怒火，“打倒叛徒刘少奇！”“肃清反革命修正主义教育路线流毒！”的口号声震天动地。
    打这以后，农校的革命师生勇猛地冲杀在革命大批判的第一线上，革命大批判如火如荼地开展起来了。他们对党内头号走资派刘少奇及其代理人有控诉不完的仇恨。他们一边批判走资派，一边狠斗“私”字，肃清叛徒刘少奇的修正主义流毒。
