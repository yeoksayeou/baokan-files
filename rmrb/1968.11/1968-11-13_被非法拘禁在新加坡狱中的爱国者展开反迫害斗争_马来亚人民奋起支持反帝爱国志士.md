Patriots illegally detained in Singapore prisons launch struggle against persecution; Malayan people rise up to support anti-imperialist patriots

According to Xinhua News Agency, recent reports from Singapore indicate that the Malayan people have continued to take various actions to support the anti-imperialist patriots who have been illegally detained in Singapore prisons for an extended period. These patriots are engaged in a hunger strike against persecution, strongly protesting the brutal treatment of political prisoners by the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, who are tools of American and British imperialism.

According to Singapore newspapers, many young people in Singapore held a demonstration on the evening of the 6th, angrily protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the reactionary authorities against the anti-imperialist patriots they have detained.

According to the *Frontline News*, many people in Singapore have recently taken to the streets in groups to distribute leaflets and write slogans. On November 1st, dozens of brave individuals hung several dozen banners in various parts of the city, with slogans such as "Firmly support the hunger strike of our comrades in prison," "Severely condemn the reactionary regime's persecution of prisoners," and "Hang Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew!"

Some trade unions and political parties in Malaya, as well as anti-imperialist patriots illegally detained in the Muar concentration camp in Johor, have also issued statements, firmly supporting the just struggle of the anti-imperialist patriots illegally detained in Singapore prisons.

The Socialist Front of Malaya recently held a mass protest rally in Singapore with over 2,000 participants, strongly denouncing the heinous crimes of the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime in persecuting political prisoners.

The hunger strike launched by some anti-imperialist patriots illegally detained in Singapore prisons to protest the persecution by the reactionary authorities began on October 3rd and has lasted for over a month. According to family members of the political prisoners, the bodies of the anti-imperialist patriots engaged in the hunger strike are extremely weak, but their will is very strong, and they are determined to see the struggle against persecution through to the end. One of the anti-imperialist patriots participating in the hunger strike firmly told his family, "We may sacrifice ourselves, but you must continue the struggle and use Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the imperialist reactionaries!"

    据新加坡报纸报道，在新加坡，许多青年六日晚再次举行示威，愤怒抗议反动当局迫害被它们拘禁的反帝爱国志士的法西斯暴行。
    另据《阵线报》报道，在新加坡，许多群众最近成群结队地上街分发传单和书写标语。十一月一日，数十名勇敢的群众在市区的许多地方悬挂了几十幅布标语，上面写着“坚决支援狱中同志的绝食斗争”、“严厉谴责反动政权迫害狱中同志”、“吊死拉赫曼、李光耀”等口号。
    马来亚的一些工会和政党组织以及被非法关禁在柔佛州麻坡集中营的反帝爱国志士，最近也分别发表声明，坚决支持被非法拘禁在新加坡狱中的反帝爱国志士的正义斗争。
    马来亚社会主义阵线最近在新加坡举行了一个有二千多人参加的群众抗议大会，强烈声讨拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团迫害政治犯的滔天罪行。
    被非法拘禁在新加坡狱中的一些反帝爱国志士为抗议反动当局迫害而进行的绝食斗争是从十月三日开始的，到现在已历时一个多月。据政治犯家属透露，进行绝食斗争的反帝爱国志士的身体虽然非常衰弱，但他们的意志非常坚强，誓死要把反迫害正义斗争进行到底。一位进行绝食斗争的反帝爱国志士坚定地对家属说：“我们可能会牺牲，你们要继续坚持斗争，用毛泽东思想战胜帝国主义反动派！”
