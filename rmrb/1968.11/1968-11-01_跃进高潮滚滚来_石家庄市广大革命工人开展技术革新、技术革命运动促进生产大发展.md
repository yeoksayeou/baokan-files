The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." The new surge in industrial production in Shijiazhuang City has arrived with the victory of the Cultural Revolution. This surge, driven by the vigorous development of struggle, criticism, and transformation, with technological innovation and technological revolution as its core, fully demonstrates the wisdom and ability of the working class and fully demonstrates the leading role of the working class.

Since this year, the broad revolutionary workers of Shijiazhuang City, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, have continued to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, relentlessly launching attacks on class enemies, cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the Party's organization and strengthening Party building, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, and delegating office personnel. They have launched a new surge of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The broad masses of workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not breaking means not establishing," have fiercely criticized the revisionist line of "material incentives," "expert management," and "crawling philosophy" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They have smashed the shackles of control, restriction, deduction, and punishment of workers, seized back the technical power in production, and further raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Under the guidance of the brilliant thoughts of the "Anshan Constitution" endorsed by Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary workers have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to do, striving to be the best, and striving to advance. A mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement has thus vigorously developed. New techniques, new technologies, and new products have emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, presenting a vibrant and new scene. The revolution is thriving, and production is rising steadily.

Seizing Technical Power to Launch a Technological Revolution

The new surge in industrial production in Shijiazhuang is centered around technological revolution. The Jinxing Coal Mine is a prime example.

The victorious team of the Jinxing Fourth Mine, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, began constructing a pair of inclined shafts at the end of last year to welcome the new leap in coal production. During the construction, they encountered a layer of quicksand. The reactionary technical "authorities" were at a loss, and they desperately shouted: "Domestically and internationally, the only methods to pass through a quicksand layer are grouting and freezing, there are no other methods." Following their advice, they ended up wasting one shaft.

However, some experienced construction team leaders and team members were not willing to give up. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, broke away from superstition, liberated their minds, and decided to break away from foreign frameworks and walk their own path, determined to overcome the quicksand and build the new mine. Based on the principle of canal construction in rural areas, the workers proposed the method of using cement pipes to pass through the quicksand. After repeated experiments, they finally built the mine shaft and put it into production in August of this year.

The facts have proven that the method of using cement pipes as the shaft wall and hydraulic jacks as the power source for inclined shaft construction, invented by the workers themselves, requires less investment and faster construction speed, opening up a new path for shaft construction.

Before the Cultural Revolution, a small group of capitalist roaders in the Jinxing Coal Mine had been promoting the revisionist scientific and technological line of the Chinese Khrushchev, using outdated coal mining methods. During the Cultural Revolution, the miners, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "We not only are good at destroying an old world, we also will be good at building a new world," decided to break away from the reactionary technical "authorities" shouting "old mines cannot use new coal mining methods, cannot use new coal mining machinery," and to discard the outdated coal mining methods, adopting new coal mining technologies. With the firm support of the newly established revolutionary committee, the workers relied on their own strength to create a combined machine group edge mining method, which the reactionary technical "authorities" believed was not suitable for the Jinxing Coal Mine. This greatly increased production capacity. At the same time, they reformed the thick coal seam layering method, increasing the recovery rate to about 97%, doubling the annual output.

Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the wisest and most intelligent. The working class is the main force in science and technology. Since the Cultural Revolution, the Jinxing Coal Mine has implemented 438 innovation projects, of which more than 90% were successfully innovated by workers. Technological innovation has further promoted the development of production. Since October 1966, the Jinxing Coal Mine has consecutively completed the production tasks assigned by the state for 23 months.

Kicking Out Imperialism, Revisionism, and Reactionaries, Walking Our Own Path

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Under the guidance of the brilliant red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class of Shijiazhuang dares to compete with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in speed, quality, and level. They have kicked out the set of foreign doctrines of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries and are striding forward on their own path.

The North China Pharmaceutical Factory is a prime example. After seizing the technical power of the factory, the revolutionary workers immediately launched technological revolution activities. They targeted the problems of the old production process of terramycin being complicated, labor-intensive, and low-yielding. They formed a "three-in-one" small group, consisting mainly of workers, with production and experimentation combined, to conduct experiments on process revolution. After more than a hundred repeated experiments, they finally created a new production process for continuous crystallization of terramycin with world-advanced level, simplifying the old process of seven steps into two, tripling the output, and saving 89 machines and 48 labor forces. They increased the rate of superior products to 100%.

Improving the quality of streptomycin was once a "big difficult problem" in China's antibiotic production. In the past, relying on the "experts" of the research department, it took seven or eight years and more than one million yuan, but the problem was not solved. During this Cultural Revolution, the working class took the initiative to solve it. They turned the experimental site into an important battlefield for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, and an important battlefield for competing with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. After ten months of struggle, they finally created a new production process with world-advanced level, making the quality of streptomycin surpass that of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, increasing the yield by 10%, and significantly reducing the cost. The revolutionary workers of the North China Pharmaceutical Factory also successfully developed new products such as bacitracin, neomycin, vancomycin, and curamycin, providing new antibiotics for China and the world.

Promoting Revolution through Economy, Marching Towards High-Speed Production

In the industrial revolution, the working class of Shijiazhuang firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "further promoting revolution through economy," highly carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. With just a pair of hands, they promoted revolution through economy.

The Shijiazhuang Coal Mining Machinery Factory has had insufficient boring machine capacity for many years. Before the Cultural Revolution, the capitalist roaders pursued size and foreign technology, traveling through 15 provinces and cities across the country but failed to purchase such equipment. Therefore, he once boasted: "Whoever can manufacture a boring machine will be promoted to engineer and rewarded with tens of thousands of yuan." During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashed the reactionary revisionist technological line, fully played the leading role of the working class, and collectively contributed their wisdom. Without increasing investment and adding equipment, they manufactured a large number of various types of boring machines. When they tried to manufacture the first boring machine, they lacked materials and had to search in the scrap pile. When they encountered difficulties, they stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, loudly reading "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After more than a month of repeated experiments, they finally manufactured a double-head five-axis boring machine. Using it to process ten holes on the body of a 75-meter drilling rig, they can bore them all at once, increasing the processing efficiency by eleven times compared to the original foreign boring machine.

Shijiazhuang is a city with a relatively concentrated textile industry. Textile workers have also done an excellent job in promoting revolution through economy. The Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Mill, based on the principle of self-reliance, has implemented more than 100 major technological revolution and technological innovation projects in the past year, and the entire mill has widely promoted the high-speedization of looms and fine spinning machines. The tens of thousands of textile workers in Shijiazhuang, taking the No. 2 Mill as an example, have implemented more than 700 major technological revolution and technological innovation projects in the past year. Among them are fully automatic shuttle-changing machines, automatic doffing machines, semi-automatic winding machines, automatic and semi-automatic doffing machines that march towards mechanization and automation; and steel combing machines, steel parallel combing machines, shuttleless shuttleless looms, and four-roller 150x super-large draft fine spinning machines that catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level and climb the world's scientific and technological peak, laying the foundation for the textile industry revolution and opening up a path.

Currently, the textile workers of Shijiazhuang, with a revolutionary heroic spirit, are producing more cloth for the state without increasing equipment and personnel, and are marching towards high-speed production. The loom speed has increased from the original 190 revolutions per minute to 250, 260, and 280 revolutions per minute, entering the ranks of the world's advanced textile industry. Now, 57% of the looms in all textile mills in the city have reached this speed.

    跃进高潮滚滚来
    石家庄市广大革命工人开展技术革新、技术革命运动促进生产大发展
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”石家庄市工业生产的新高潮，就是伴随着文化大革命的胜利到来的。这个高潮以蓬勃发展的斗、批、改为动力，以技术革新和技术革命为核心，充分显示了工人阶级的智慧和才能，充分显示了工人阶级的领导作用。
    今年以来，石家庄市的广大革命职工，在各级革命委员会的领导下，继续深入持久地开展革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，清理阶级队伍，整顿党的组织和加强党的建设，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，掀起斗、批、改的新高潮。广大工人群众遵照毛主席“不破不立”的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”、“爬行哲学”等反革命修正主义路线，砸烂了管、卡、扣、罚工人的枷锁，夺回了生产中的技术大权，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大革命职工在伟大领袖毛主席批示的“鞍钢宪法”的光辉思想指引下，发扬了敢想敢干、鼓足干劲、力争上游的革命精神，一个群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动便蓬勃地开展起来，新工艺、新技术、新产品，如雨后春笋，出现了一派山花烂漫的崭新景象，革命轰轰烈烈，生产节节上升。
    夺回技术权　大搞技术革命
    石家庄的工业生产新高潮是以技术革命为核心开展起来的。井陉煤矿就是一个例子。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的井陉四矿胜利队，去年年底为了迎接新的煤炭生产大跃进，开始兴建一对斜井。在施工中途遇到了流沙层，反动技术“权威”束手无策，他们为了掩盖自己的愚蠢无能，拚命地喊叫：“在国内外，过流沙层只有灌浆、冻结，没有别的办法。”根据他们的意见，结果报废了一个井口。
    但是一些具有实践经验的建井队长和队员们并不甘心，他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的伟大教导，破除迷信，解放思想，下决心打破洋框框，走自己的路，一定要战胜流沙建成新矿井。根据农村修渠道的原理，工人们提出用水泥管穿过流沙的方法。经过反复实验，终于建成了这口矿井，并于今年八月份投入了生产。
    事实证明，工人自己想出的这种用水泥管当井壁，油压千斤顶作动力的斜井施工法，投资小，建井速度快，是一条建井施工的新道路。
    在文化大革命以前，井陉煤矿一小撮走资派一直推行着中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，沿用着落后采煤方法。无产阶级文化大革命中，矿工们遵照毛主席“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的伟大教导，决心打破反动技术“权威”叫喊的“老矿井不能采用新采煤方法、不能用新采煤机械”的滥调，甩掉落后的采煤方法，采用采煤新技术。在新生的革命委员会的坚决支持下，工人们依靠自己的力量，创造出了反动技术“权威”认为在井陉煤矿不适合的联合机组边采边放采煤方法，大大提高了生产能力。同时改革了厚煤层分层法，提高回采率达到百分之九十七左右，使年产量提高了将近一倍。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人最有智慧，最聪明，工人阶级是科学技术的主力军。自从文化大革命以来，井陉煤矿一共实现了革新项目四百三十八项，其中百分之九十以上都是工人革新成功的。技术革新进一步推动了生产的发展，从一九六六年十月份以来，井陉煤矿已经连续二十三个月胜利地完成了国家交给的生产任务。
    踢开帝修反　走自己的路
    毛主席教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。石家庄的工人阶级，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的光辉指引下，敢于同帝、修、反争速度、争质量、争水平，他们踢开了帝、修、反的一套洋教条，正昂首阔步走着自己的道路。
    华北药厂就是一个例子。这个厂的革命职工在夺回了厂里的技术大权之后，立即展开了技术革命活动。他们针对土霉素旧生产工艺工序繁杂，劳动强度大，产量低等问题，组成了以工人为主体，生产与试验相配合的“三结合小组”，进行了工艺革命的试验。经过上百次反复试验之后，终于创造了具有世界先进水平的土霉素连续结晶生产新工艺，把旧工艺七道工序简化为二道，使产量翻了三番，并且节省出八十九台机器和四十八个劳动力，把优级品率提高到百分之百。
    提高链霉素质量，原来是我国抗菌素生产中的一个“老大难”问题。过去依靠科研部门的“专家”用了七、八年时间，花费一百多万元，也没有解决。在这次文化大革命中，工人阶级自己起来解决了。他们把试验场当成批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人的重要阵地，当成与帝、修、反较量的重要阵地，经过十个月的奋战，终于创造出具有世界先进水平的崭新的生产工艺，使链霉素的质量超过了美帝、苏修，收率提高百分之十，成本也有大幅度的降低。华北药厂的广大革命职工还试制成功了杆菌肽、新生霉素、万古霉素、曲古霉素等多种新产品，为我国和世界提供了新的抗菌素。
    节约闹革命，向高速化生产进军
    在工业革命中，石家庄的工人阶级牢记毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大教导，高度发扬了自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，凭着一双手，节约闹革命。
    石家庄煤矿机械厂，多年来镗床能力不足。文化大革命以前，走资派贪大求洋，跑遍了全国十五个省市都没有买到这种设备，因此他曾扬言：谁能制造一台镗床，就提拔谁为工程师，并奖给他几万元。在文化大革命中，革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，彻底砸烂了反动的修正主义技术路线，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，群策群力，没有增加投资，没添设备，就自己制造出了大批各种类型的镗床。他们在试制第一台镗床时，没有料，就到废料堆里去找，遇到难关，就站在毛主席像前，高声朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”经过一个多月的反复试验，终于制成了一台双头五轴镗床。用它加工七十五米钻机本体上的十个孔位，可以一次镗成，比原来洋镗床加工效率提高十一倍。
    石家庄是一个纺织工业较集中的城市，纺织工人在节约闹革命中也做得很出色。石家庄国棉二厂本着自力更生的原则，一年来实现了重大技术革命和技术革新项目上百项，全厂大面积地推广了布机高速化、细纱机高速化。石家庄几万纺织工人以二厂为榜样，一年来已实现重大技术革命和技术革新项目七百多项。其中有向机械化、自动化进军的全自动穿筘机、自动接经机、半自动络筒机、自动和半自动的落纱机；有赶超世界先进水平、攀登世界科技高峰的清钢联合机、钢并联合机、无梭箭杆布机、四罗拉150倍超大牵伸细纱机等等，为纺织工业革命打下了基础、开创了路子。
    目前，石家庄的纺织工人正以革命的英雄主义气概，在不增加设备不增加人员的情况下，给国家生产更多的布匹，开始向高速化生产进军。布机速度由原来的每分钟一百九十转，开到二百五十转、二百六十转、二百八十转，跃入了世界纺织工业的先进行列。现在，全市各纺织厂已有百分之五十七的布机达到了这样的速度。
