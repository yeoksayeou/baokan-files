Washington, November 13 (Xinhua) - Hundreds of black children in Hyde County, North Carolina, have been defying the brutal suppression of the U.S. reactionary regime and have been holding demonstrations for several days to protest against the reactionary policies of racial discrimination imposed by the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

Since the beginning of the school year on September 5, more than 850 black elementary and middle school students in this county have been on strike, protesting against the reactionary authorities' implementation of racial discrimination policies. Recently, the county's "Welfare Department" even threatened to stop welfare assistance to force these children to give up their strike. However, this shameless threat only provoked greater anger among the black children. On November 8, hundreds of black children aged 9 to 14 held a demonstration, surrounded the state "Welfare Department" building, and even rushed inside. The U.S. reactionary regime called in a large number of police, who released tear gas at the black children and, together with a group of white racist thugs, brutally beat these children with batons.

The reactionary violence of the U.S. ruling class cannot suppress the fighting spirit of the black children. On November 11, hundreds of black children held another demonstration in the courthouse, protesting against the suppression by the reactionary ruling clique. At this time, a large number of fascist police threw a smoke bomb at these children and arrested six of them. On November 12, the black children continued their demonstrations outside the prison and marched in the streets, shouting slogans such as "We will not be swayed by the batons" to express their determination to fight to the end. The U.S. reactionary regime again arrested more than 50 black children. However, the black children in this county are not afraid of violence and are continuing their struggle.

Washington, November 12 (Xinhua) - Students from two U.S. colleges have been staging strikes and demonstrations to oppose the decaying capitalist educational system.

According to a report by a Western news agency on November 11, students at Spelman College, a black women's college in Atlanta, Georgia, held a two-day strike demanding reforms to the decaying capitalist educational system. More than 150 students at the University of Connecticut in Connecticut stormed the administrative building of the school on November 11, held an all-night sit-in demonstration, distributed leaflets, and strongly protested against the reactionary authorities' persecution of students who participated in demonstrations against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

Faced with the surging progressive student movement in the United States, the anxious U.S. reactionary ruling clique recently gathered the heads of universities and colleges across the country in Washington to plot the suppression of U.S. students. However, the facts have proven that the struggle of U.S. students cannot be suppressed, and the plots of the U.S. ruling clique are doomed to fail.

In Mexico, a large number of young people are protesting against the savage suppression and cruel persecution by the reactionary regime, holding up banners with slogans such as "We will not rest until we win" and marching in the streets.

　　蔑视反动当局警棍毒气　英勇不屈反对种族歧视
　　美国黑人少年连日奋起抗暴
　　美国两所学院学生不断罢课示威反对腐朽教育制度
    新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国北卡罗来纳州海德县的数百名黑人儿童，不顾美国反动当局对他们的残暴镇压，连日来一再举行示威，抗议美国反动统治集团对他们实行种族歧视的反动政策。
    从九月五日本学年开学以来，这个县的八百五十多名黑人中小学生一直坚持罢课，抗议反动当局推行的种族歧视政策。最近，这个县的“福利部”竟然用停止福利补助来进行威胁，强迫这些儿童放弃罢课斗争。但是，这种无耻的威胁引起了黑人儿童更大的愤怒。十一月八日，数百名九岁到十四岁的黑人儿童举行示威，包围了州“福利部”大楼，并且冲了进去。美国反动当局竟然召来大批警察，向黑人儿童施放催泪瓦斯，并且伙同一批白人种族主义分子，用警棍残酷地毒打这些儿童。
    美国反动派的反革命暴力压制不了黑人儿童的斗争意志。十一日，数百名黑人儿童在法院里再次举行示威，抗议反动统治集团对他们的镇压。这时，大批法西斯警察又向这些儿童扔一发烟弹，并且逮捕了六名儿童。十二日，黑人儿童再接再厉在监狱外进行示威，在大街上游行，高呼“我们决不听警棍的摆布”的口号，表示他们斗争到底的决心。美国反动派又再下毒手，逮捕了五十余名黑人儿童。但是，这个县的黑人儿童不畏强暴，正在继续坚持斗争。
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国两所院校的学生，接连举行罢课和示威，反对腐朽的资本主义教育制度。
    据西方通讯社十一日报道，乔治亚州亚特兰大市黑人女子学院斯佩尔曼学院的学生连续两天举行罢课，要求改革腐朽的资本主义教育制度。康涅狄克州康涅狄克大学的一百五十多名学生，十一日冲进这个学校的行政大楼，在大楼里举行了通宵静坐示威，散发传单，强烈抗议学校反动当局迫害参加反对美国侵略越南示威的学生。
    面临不断高涨的美国进步学生运动，惊慌不安的美国反动统治集团最近在华盛顿纠集了美国全国高等院校的校长、董事等反动头头，策划镇压美国学生的阴谋。但是事实已经证明，美国学生的斗争是镇压不下去的，美国统治集团的阴谋必将遭到失败。（附图片）
