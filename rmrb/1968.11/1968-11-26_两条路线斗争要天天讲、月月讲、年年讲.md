The east wind is sweeping, and the red flag is flying high. The latest instructions from Chairman Mao have been issued, like a thunderclap shaking the earth.

Chairman Mao points out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has paid attention to historical experience and, with revolutionary methods, has carried out the unprecedented scale of mass movement to learn, propagate, implement, and realize Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, has achieved great and decisive victories. The task of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is to widely propagate the great thought of Mao Zedong, so that the broad revolutionary masses know what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and what is Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, to implement Chairman Mao's series of instructions, and to ensure that the red regime will never change color.

The Beijing Normal University where we are stationed has long been controlled by a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders. They have been recruiting and collaborating with traitors, forming cliques, and fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, implementing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and instilling counter-revolutionary revisionist ideas into students, such as "reading books to become officials," "going to the countryside to gain experience," "suffering small losses to gain big advantages," and so on. This has caused students to become detached from proletarian politics, from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and from labor. We are truly angry and resentful about this situation. Many students have even lost their feelings for the workers and peasants! Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line has poisoned so many people!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it must be led by the working class, it must have the participation of the working-class masses, and it must be combined with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Together with the active elements in the school who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution, the workers' propaganda team must stay in the school for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the school." Following Chairman Mao's great instructions, we have entered Beijing Normal University, seized back all the power usurped by a handful of class enemies, armed the broad masses of teachers and students with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carried out activities of remembrance, comparison, and criticism: remembering the bitterness of the old society, comparing the sweetness of the new society, criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism; denouncing the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, comparing the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We have also chosen one of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary viewpoints to conduct an in-depth criticism based on the students' active thoughts. Revolutionary teachers and students deeply feel: "Every time we criticize one of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary viewpoints, our awareness of the struggle between the two lines increases, our feelings for the workers, peasants, and soldiers deepen, and our loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line increases." After criticizing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies such as "reading books to become officials" and "going to the countryside to gain experience," many students said: Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is a line of selfishness, a line of restoring capitalism, more poisonous than poison. Many students have expressed: We must thoroughly cleanse Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line from our minds, firmly follow the course indicated by Chairman Mao, go to the countryside, to the factories, to the borders, to the grassroots, accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly transform our old thoughts, and walk the path of uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

We deeply feel: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the sharpest ideological weapon, the strongest weapon for educating and uniting the people and striking the enemy. The history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, we must discuss it daily, monthly, annually, and forever, so that the great red flag of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will fly high and forever!

    两条路线斗争要天天讲、月月讲、年年讲
    驻北京师范学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    东风浩荡，红旗飘扬，毛主席的最新指示发表，象一声春雷震撼大地。
    毛主席指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”无产阶级文化大革命，就是注意了历史经验，并以革命的方法，学习、宣传、贯彻、落实毛主席无产阶级革命路线的空前规模的群众运动。无产阶级文化大革命，就是在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的任务，就是要广泛宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，让广大革命群众都知道什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，落实毛主席的一系列指示，保证红色江山永不变色。
    我们进驻的北京师范学院，长期以来被一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派统治着。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，贯彻刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，向学生灌输反革命修正主义思想，什么“读书做官论”，什么“下乡镀金”，什么“吃小亏，占大便宜”等等，使得学生脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农兵群众，脱离劳动。对这种情况，我们真是又气又恨。很多学生竟变得没有工农感情了，刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线毒害了多少人啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”我们遵照毛主席的伟大指示，开进北京师范学院，把一小撮阶级敌人窃取的一切大权夺了回来，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线武装广大师生的头脑，并开展了大忆、大比、大批活动：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，批判叛徒刘少奇复辟资本主义的滔天罪行；控诉刘少奇反革命修正主义思想对自己的毒害，比毛主席无产阶级教育路线的英明伟大，批判刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线。并针对学生中的活思想，选择刘少奇一个反动观点，进行深入地批判。革命师生深有体会地说：“每批判一次刘少奇的反动观点，自己就提高一分两条路线斗争的觉悟，增加一分工农兵的感情，加深一分对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的忠诚。”一些同学狠批了刘少奇的“读书做官论”、“下乡镀金”等反动谬论以后说：刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线是私字路线，是复辟资本主义的路线，比毒药还毒。许多学生表示：一定要从思想深处彻底肃清刘少奇修正主义路线的毒害，坚决沿着毛主席指引的航向，到农村去，到工矿去，到边疆去，到基层去，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造旧思想，走和工农兵结合的道路。
    我们深刻地体会到：毛主席的革命路线是最锐利的思想武器，是教育人民，团结人民，打击敌人的最强大的武器。党内两条路线的斗争历史，我们就是要天天讲、月月讲、年年讲、永远讲，让毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
