Calcutta students continued their anti-American protests for the second day on November 21, angrily denouncing the visit of former U.S. Secretary of Defense and World Bank President McNamara to the city for his conspiratorial activities, and condemning U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

According to reports, enraged students burned an effigy of McNamara outside the U.S. Information Service building in Calcutta. Surrounded by the smoldering ashes, they held a protest demonstration, shouting slogans denouncing the war monger McNamara and other anti-American sentiments. The reactionary police in Calcutta threw tear gas at the protesters in an attempt to stop the students' just actions. The students bravely fought back against the police on the streets, pelting them with stones and bricks, and set fire to a bus and two trams in the city center.

According to reports, all shops in Calcutta were closed on November 21, and many tram and bus routes were suspended. Students from all schools in the city went on strike to protest the police's brutal suppression of the demonstrators.

According to reports, McNamara was terrified by the wave of protests from the people of Calcutta. For two days, he has been cowering inside the Governor's House, not daring to go out, and has announced the cancellation of his scheduled "visit."
