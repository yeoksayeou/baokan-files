In the wake of the great news from the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, factories and mines in the Guiyang area that have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule have launched a new wave of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The workers of the Guiyang Coal Mine, the Guiyang Bearing Factory, the 102nd Factory of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau, the Spring Thunder Precision Instrument Factory, and the Cold Stamping Workshop of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, all of which have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule by more than two months, have quickly launched a wave of studying, publicizing, and implementing the bulletin after its release. The revolutionary workers of these units are determined to complete the various combat tasks outlined in the bulletin with concrete actions.

After the bulletin was issued, the Guiyang Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee immediately organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, using the bulletin as a mirror to summarize experiences, identify gaps, and focus on the weak links in the work. They proposed new production plans and measures to achieve these plans. The workers at the Chaidian and Zazha coal pits of this mine, after studying the bulletin, have increased their enthusiasm and the excavation progress has increased by more than 50% in four days.

After the release of the bulletin from the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers of the Guiyang Bearing Factory, using the bulletin as a sharp weapon, continued to expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, raising the level of revolutionary criticism to a new height. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory are full of fighting spirit. On the basis of completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule, they have proposed new production targets.

After the revolutionary workers of the 102nd Factory of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau took over the technical leadership, they implemented fourteen major technological innovations. The entire factory completed this year's production tasks two months ahead of schedule. After the bulletin was issued, the enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers soared even higher. The lathe class, through collective wisdom, quickly designed a new fixture, increasing work efficiency by more than one fold. The foundry class revolutionary workers designed a hot wind furnace, which was originally planned to be completed and put into production by the end of next January. Now, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they are determined to complete this task in ten days.

The revolutionary workers of the Spring Thunder Precision Instrument Factory, which has successfully entered 1969, said at the study session of the bulletin: "We must always maintain a strong revolutionary spirit and make new contributions to promote a new leap in the socialist construction of our country." Various classes have launched socialist labor competitions, and work efficiency has significantly improved.

Inspired by the bulletin of the Eighth Enlarged Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers of the Hunan Rubber Factory have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," launched a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform, and promoted production.

After the release of the bulletin, the revolutionary workers of this factory launched a mass movement of studying, publicizing, and implementing the bulletin. The members of the factory and various workshop revolutionary committees all placed this work at the forefront and went deep into the workshops and classes to lead by example in studying, publicizing, and implementing. All seven workshops and service departments of the entire factory have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes to study, publicize, and implement the bulletin of the plenary session.

The more the revolutionary workers study, the brighter their minds become, and the more revolutionary spirit they have. They reviewed the more than two-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply realizing that following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! The revolutionary workers expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm and determined to complete all the great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session. The entire factory quickly launched a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform, and promoted production.

The revolutionary workers of the Rubber Refining Class III have severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "material incentives" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, highlighting proletarian politics, and have continuously overfulfilled the production plan in recent days.

The revolutionary workers of the Hunan Rubber Factory, while studying the bulletin, reviewed and summarized the work of the factory, and took measures to implement it, effectively promoting the development of the factory's struggle, criticism, and reform, and production. Using synthetic rubber butadiene rubber to replace imported natural rubber is a long-standing difficult problem in the factory's production. The revolutionary workers of the First Workshop, after studying the bulletin of the plenary session, said proudly: "Chairman Mao is backing us workers, we must make Chairman Mao proud! We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and firmly take the road of self-reliance, let Liu Shaoqi's 'crawling philosophy' go to hell!" They immediately established a three-in-one small group with workers as the main body, involving revolutionary technical personnel and revolutionary cadres, to study new technologies and formulate new processes, quickly putting butadiene rubber into production. The machine repair workers of the Fifth Workshop, inspired by the bulletin of the plenary session, repaired a rubber surface one-time molding machine that used to take several days to repair in just one night, ensuring the production needs.

    用实际行动响应公报发出的战斗号召
    贵阳地区一批提前完成生产计划的厂矿乘胜前进掀起抓革命促生产新高潮
    湖南橡胶厂边学习公报边总结工作边落实任务有力推动斗批改和生产发展
    据新华社贵阳九日电  在党的八届十二中全会的特大喜讯鼓舞下，贵阳地区一批提前超额完成全年生产计划的厂矿，掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。提前两个多月超额完成全年生产计划的贵阳煤矿、贵阳轴承厂、第二铁路工程局一○二厂、春雷精密电表厂和贵州柴油机厂冷冲车间等先进单位，在全会公报发表后迅速掀起了学习、宣传、落实公报的热潮。这些单位的革命职工决心以实际行动完成公报所提出的各项战斗任务。
    贵阳煤矿革委会在公报发表后，立即举办了毛泽东思想学习班，以公报为镜子，总结经验，寻找差距，狠抓工作中的薄弱环节，提出了新的增产计划和完成增产计划的措施，这个矿的茶田和扎佐两个煤井的工人，学习了公报以后，干劲倍增，掘进进尺四天中猛增了百分之五十以上。八届十二中全会公报发表后，贵阳轴承厂的广大革命职工以公报为锐利武器，继续清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙的反革命罪行，把革命大批判提高到一个新的水平。全厂革命职工斗志昂扬，在提前超额完成全年生产计划的基础上，又提出了新的增产目标。第二铁路工程局一○二厂的革命工人掌握了技术领导大权后，实现了十四项重大技术革新项目，全厂提前两个月完成了今年生产任务。公报发表以后，革命工人的积极性更加高涨。车工班群策群力，很快设计成功了一种新夹具，提高工效一倍多。铸工班革命工人设计的热风冲天炉，原来计划到明年一月底建成投产，现在他们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，决心奋战十天完成这项任务。胜利跨入一九六九年的春雷精密电表厂革命工人，在学习公报的讲用会上豪迈地说：“我们要始终保持旺盛的革命干劲，为促进我国的社会主义建设出现新的飞跃立新功。”各个班组之间开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，工作效率显著提高。
    据新华社长沙九日电  在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，湖南橡胶厂广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，掀起了斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    全会公报发表后，这个工厂的广大革命职工展开了学习、宣传、落实的群众运动。厂和各车间革命委员会的成员，都把这项工作摆在首位，并深入车间、班组，带头学习，带头宣传，带头落实。全厂七个车间和服务部门，都办起了学习、宣传、落实全会公报的毛泽东思想学习班。
    广大革命职工越学心里越亮，越学革命干劲越足。他们回顾了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，深刻体会到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！革命职工们满怀革命豪情地表示，坚决完成全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务。全厂迅速掀起了斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的新高潮。炼胶丙班革命职工狠批刘少奇的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，突出无产阶级政治，几天来连续超额完成生产计划。
    湖南橡胶厂的革命职工边学习公报，边对照检查总结本厂工作，边采取落实措施，有力地推动了工厂的斗、批、改和生产的发展。采用人造橡胶丁苪胶代替进口的天然橡胶，是这个厂生产中的一个“老大难”问题。一车间的革命职工学习了全会公报，豪迈地说：“毛主席给我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，坚决走自力更生的道路，让刘少奇的‘爬行哲学’见鬼去吧！”他们马上成立了以工人为主体的、有革命技术人员和革命干部参加的三结合小组，研究新技术，制订新工艺，使丁苪胶迅速用于生产。五车间机修工人在全会公报的鼓舞下，一个晚上抢修好了一台过去需要几天时间才能修好的胶面一次出型机，保证了生产的需要。
