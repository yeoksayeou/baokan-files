The suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, published in *People's Daily*, and the editorial note from *People's Daily* speak the words that are in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I am truly delighted from the bottom of my heart.

There are many advantages to having public primary schools managed by the production brigade. The most significant advantage is that power is in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power." The fundamental issue of the educational revolution is also the issue of power. In the past, Mao Zedong's proletarian educational line could not be implemented, and the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois educational line could wreak havoc everywhere, simply because power was not in the hands of the proletariat.

When power is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, they use bourgeois ideology to cultivate bourgeois successors. Teachers teach for the sake of "promotion," and students study for the sake of "officialdom." In the end, the higher the culture, the further away from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They leave as the flesh and blood of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but when they return, they look down on us "peasants with high cornflowers on our heads and yellow mud on our legs" and do not want to be close to us. If this continues, how can the country that Chairman Mao fought for on behalf of the poor and lower-middle peasants not change color! Our country is a socialist country, and rural primary schools should be part of the production brigade. In our opinion, the most fundamental issue of public primary schools being managed by the production brigade is that the educational power is truly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. When the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants hold the educational power, they can carry out the educational revolution well and change the unreasonable rules and regulations in schools. In the past, public primary schools stipulated that each class should be 45 minutes long. How can the poor and lower-middle peasants, who teach village history and family history as class education, be so precise as to fit into 45 minutes? When we poor and lower-middle peasants manage the school, we can arrange the classes according to the content of the lectures, ensuring that the poor and lower-middle peasants can always stand on the school platform; we can change the restrictions on enrollment quotas and age, change the standards for paying tuition fees, and enroll a large number of children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, truly achieving universal education. When the poor and lower-middle peasants hold the educational power, they can change the "three separations" to "no separation," and better let intellectuals receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Teachers are not only teachers but also community members, not only propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought but also fighters against selfishness and revisionism. They eat the same food and live in the same houses as the poor and lower-middle peasants, so they can have the same feelings as the poor and lower-middle peasants and truly do things for us. When the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants hold the educational power, they can change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, use Mao Zedong Thought to educate students, and cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only when the poor and lower-middle peasants hold the educational power can they implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

We feel that public primary schools being managed by the production brigade fundamentally solve the fundamental issue of whether schools are run by the poor and lower-middle peasants or by bourgeois intellectuals, and whether the next generation is educated with Mao Zedong Thought or with revisionist thought.

### “权”是教育革命的根本问题

　　“权”是教育革命的根本问题
    《人民日报》发表的侯振民、王庆余两同志的建议和《人民日报》的编者按语，说出了贫下中农心里的话，俺打心眼里高兴。
    公办小学下放到大队办，好处很多。千好万好，就好在权掌握在贫下中农手里。“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”教育革命的根本问题，也是权的问题。过去，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线不能贯彻，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的资产阶级教育路线能到处害人，就是个权不在无产阶级手里。
    权在资产阶级手里，他就用资产阶级思想，培养资产阶级接班人；老师为“升官”而教，学生为“做官”而学。到头来，文化越高，离贫下中农越远，走时是贫下中农的亲骨肉，回来看见俺这“头顶高粱花，两腿老黄泥”的庄稼汉，就不愿偎边了。这样，日子长了，毛主席给贫下中农打出来的江山还有个不变色的！咱们的国家是社会主义国家，农村小学应该是大队的一个部分。叫俺们说，公办小学下放到大队办，最根本的问题，是教育大权真正掌握在贫下中农手里了。工人阶级和贫下中农掌握了教育权，就能搞好教育革命，改变学校中不合理的规章制度。过去的公办小学规定一节课四十五分钟，贫下中农讲村史、家史等阶级教育课，咋能这么巧讲四十五分钟呢？俺贫下中农管理了学校，就能按照讲课内容自己安排，保证贫下中农永远登上学校的讲台；就能改变公办学校名额、年龄的限制，改变交纳学费的标准等，大量吸收贫下中农子女入学，切实做到普及教育。贫下中农掌握了教育权，就能改变“三脱离”为不脱离，更好地让知识分子接受贫下中农的再教育。教师既是教员，又是社员，既是毛泽东思想宣传员，又是斗私批修的战斗员。他们和贫下中农吃一样饭，住一样房，就能和贫下中农有一样的感情，才能给咱贫下中农办事情。工人阶级和贫下中农掌握了教育权，就能改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，用毛泽东思想教育学生，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。只有贫下中农掌握了教育权，才能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，才能落实毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示。
    俺们觉得：公办小学下放给大队办，从根本上解决了学校是由贫下中农办还是由资产阶级知识分子办，是用毛泽东思想还是用修正主义思想教育下一代的根本路线、根本方向的大问题。
