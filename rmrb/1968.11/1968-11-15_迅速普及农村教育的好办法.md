The *People's Daily* published the revolutionary suggestions of Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, along with an editorial note. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary students in our commune are thrilled. Everyone says that these suggestions align with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and we firmly support them.

Moving rural public primary schools to the brigade level to manage is a necessity of the times. We feel that there are many advantages to moving rural public primary schools to the brigade level:

1. It helps to eliminate the lingering effects of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi.
2. Teachers can more easily receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants.
3. It encourages the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the initiative in education, rapidly popularizing primary and secondary education.
4. The state can save a large amount of manpower and resources, concentrating funds for industrial and agricultural construction.

Because of these advantages, the poor and lower-middle peasants all say, "The suggestion to move rural public primary schools to the brigade level speaks for us." Many revolutionary teachers in our commune's primary schools also say they will act immediately and resolutely take the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

　　迅速普及农村教育的好办法
      《人民日报》发表了侯振民、王庆余两位同志的革命建议和编者按，我们公社的贫下中农和革命师生都高兴极啦。大家都说，这个建议符合毛泽东思想，符合毛主席的革命路线，我们坚决支持。
    把农村公办小学下放到大队来办，这是形势发展的需要。我们体会，农村公办小学下放到大队办的好处很多：一，它有利于消除叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒。二，教师便于接受贫下中农的再教育。三，有利于调动贫下中农办学的积极性，迅速普及小学教育和中学教育。四，国家可以节省大量人力、物力，集中资金投入工农业建设。
    由于有这么多好处，所以贫下中农都说：“把农村公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，说出了我们的心里话。”我们公社许多小学的革命教师也说要闻风而动，立即实行，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。
