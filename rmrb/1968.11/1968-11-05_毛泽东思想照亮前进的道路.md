The decision by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and to remove all his positions within and outside the Party reflects the strong will of the people nationwide. We wholeheartedly support this decision. We must, under the guidance of the communiqué, continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and criticism, thoroughly expose and condemn the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and other top anti-Party elements, ensuring they never resurface, and completely eliminate their counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology.

"Navigating the seas requires a helmsman; revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." Looking back at the past two years of struggle, at every critical moment in the victory of the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province, it was the radiant Mao Zedong Thought that illuminated the path forward. We have received the affectionate care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. Every victory in our province has been achieved under the battle orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters.

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Zhejiang are time bombs hidden within our Party. They have been colluding with enemies, forming cliques, and brazenly opposing our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, openly defying Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" has sounded the death knell for this bourgeois headquarters hidden within the Party. However, in the early stages of the movement, this small group of counter-revolutionaries still struggled desperately. They "distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, suppressed revolutionaries, and silenced dissenting opinions, imposing white terror," labeling a group of revolutionary pioneers as counter-revolutionaries, attempting to suppress the surging proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the critical moment when the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians launched a power seizure struggle against a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, these counter-revolutionaries launched the "February Countercurrent," attempting to seize power back. The black hands of the "February Countercurrent" directly reached Zhejiang. This spring, when the proletarian revolutionaries in Zhejiang were preparing to establish the provincial revolutionary committee, a malicious wind of rehabilitating the "February Countercurrent" blew into Zhejiang. At these critical moments of class struggle, two-line struggles, and two-road struggles, it was the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin that pointed the way for the military and people of Zhejiang, guiding us from victory to victory. What is particularly unforgettable is that last year, Chairman Mao personally inspected our province and gave a series of extremely important instructions, immediately turning the situation of the proletarian Cultural Revolution in our province around and greatly promoting revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Practice has proven a truth: following Chairman Mao means victory, loyalty to Chairman Mao means happiness!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of all the people of China. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the representative of the interests of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad masses of laborers. It is the sole leadership center of the entire Party, army, and nation. The 31 million military and civilian personnel in Zhejiang are determined to closely unite around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, resolutely criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," unify our thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The experience of the Cultural Revolution tells us: we must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, firmly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and timely, accurately, and comprehensively implement the battle tasks and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin among the masses, turning them into the conscious actions of the masses. This is the fundamental task of the revolutionary committees.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee further points the way and tasks for the nationwide military and civilian personnel to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We must seriously study the communiqué, enthusiastically propagate the communiqué, and strive to complete all the great tasks proposed in the communiqué.

    毛泽东思想照亮前进的道路
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，反映了全国人民的强烈愿望，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护。我们一定要在公报的指引下，继续深入地开展革命大批判，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派批倒批臭，使他们永世不得翻身，并且彻底肃清他们的反革命修正主义的思想。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”回顾两年多来的战斗历程，我们浙江省的文化大革命运动胜利发展的每一个关键时刻，都是光芒四射的毛泽东思想照亮了前进的道路，都受到了伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的亲切关怀。我省的每一个胜利，都是在毛主席无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下取得的。
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在浙江的代理人，是埋藏在我们党内的定时炸弹，他们招降纳叛、结党营私，猖狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，明目张胆地对抗毛主席的革命路线。毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报给这个隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部敲响了丧钟。但是在运动初期，这一小撮反革命分子还进行垂死挣扎。他们“颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖”，把一批革命闯将打成反革命，妄图将轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。在广大无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派发起夺权斗争的关键时刻，这些反革命分子，又掀起“二月逆流”，妄图反夺权。“二月逆流”的黑干将还直接把黑手伸向浙江。今年春天，当浙江的无产阶级革命派正在筹建省革命委员会时，一股为“二月逆流”翻案的妖风，又刮到浙江。在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，给浙江军民指明了方向，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。特别令人难忘的是，去年毛主席他老人家曾亲临我省视察，并作了一系列极为重要的指示，使我省无产阶级文化大革命的形势，立即出现了一个飞跃，大大促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。斗争实践证明了一个真理：紧跟毛主席就是胜利，忠于毛主席就是幸福！
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是工人阶级、贫下中农和广大劳动群众利益的代表者，是全党、全军、全国唯一的领导中心。我们浙江三千一百万军民，决心紧密团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的周围，坚决批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无产阶级文化大革命的经验告诉我们：必须更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，及时地准确地全面地把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务和方针政策，落实到群众中去，变为群众的自觉行动，这是革委会的根本任务。
    党的八届十二中全会公报，进一步为全国军民指明了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的方向和任务。我们一定要认真学习公报，热情地宣传公报，为圆满完成公报中提出的各项伟大任务而奋斗。
