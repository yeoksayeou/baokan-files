The revolutionary workers of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization," with the strong support of relevant sister units, overcame various difficulties and successfully developed the domestically designed 190 air-cooled diesel engine of advanced level, making a contribution to agricultural mechanization in mountainous areas.

This diesel engine weighs 105 kilograms, is small in size, easy to operate, simple to maintain, fuel-efficient, and has a wide range of applications. When fitted with a tractor chassis, it becomes a small, elegant tractor that can be used for both dry and wet fields, equivalent to six oxen for plowing and harrowing; when fitted with a trailer, it can be used as a transport vehicle; when towing a 5-kilowatt generator, it can provide lighting for 200 households; when fitted with a small water pump, it can irrigate 200 mu of farmland; when fitted with a rice huller, it can hull 600 to 800 kilograms of rice per hour; when fitted with a grinder, it can cut grass, process corn, wheat, etc., and grind 150 kilograms of flour per hour. Recently, during the comprehensive utilization test of the 190 air-cooled diesel engine in rural areas, it received praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants, who said: "We have been waiting for this tractor that suits our mountainous area. Chairman Mao understands our wishes best and has sent us the tractor."

In the past, the capitalist roaders in this factory long resisted Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural mechanization, following the black directive of China's Khrushchev to "profit first," producing automobile parts, aluminum pots, stoves, and other items to make money and "secure their jobs." They believed in bourgeois "experts" and reactionary technical "authorities," letting "experts" decide on technical issues, with workers having no say. Therefore, they did not produce a single piece of agricultural machinery that was welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and served agricultural production.

Last June, after the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, the working class took charge, overthrowing the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities." They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on various tractor models and performance, which must adapt to China's climate and terrain, must be comprehensively utilized, and must have the lowest possible cost, to deeply understand that agricultural machinery factories should face the five hundred million peasants, wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and resolutely follow the path of agricultural mechanization indicated by Chairman Mao.

After clarifying the direction of the factory, the revolutionary workers carefully analyzed the climate and terrain of the Guizhou region and decided to develop the multi-purpose 190 air-cooled diesel engine. They formed a technical management group consisting mainly of workers, with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel, to be responsible for the development of this new product.

During the development process, the factory had poor equipment and weak technical strength, encountering many difficulties, all of which were overcome by the working class armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They made molds themselves, and if there were unreasonable parts in the drawings, they immediately changed them. Old worker Li Zongguang from the machining and assembly workshop, hearing that the workshop urgently needed a part, worked tirelessly overnight without considering fatigue or rest, and only left after personally delivering the machined part to the assembly workshop and installing it. Old worker Wang Zhizhen, with a loyal heart to Chairman Mao, worked day and night, voluntarily designing over 60 sets of dies. The workers in the foundry workshop pooled their wisdom, played the role of the three-in-one combination, and quickly broke through three technical difficulties in aluminum alloy melting and casting.

The cylinder liner, originally designed as an integral part according to the drawings, was made of aluminum alloy and cast iron, which was complex to process and had high costs. The workers, with a daring spirit, broke through the "foreign dogma" and made the cylinder liner entirely of high-phosphorus iron, making the processing simple, improving work efficiency, and reducing costs. However, the heat dissipation performance was poor, easily causing cylinder pulling and engine stoppage. To solve this problem, the old workers in the factory's testing room suggested canceling four screw holes and changing the arrangement of the heat dissipation fins. The old workers in the foundry workshop improved the casting method, making the cylinder liner meet the quality requirements. After multiple tests, it fully met the national standards. An engineer saw it and respectfully said: "This is something we didn't even dare to think about before, but you did it, truly amazing!"

From the practice of successfully developing the 190 air-cooled diesel engine, they deeply felt that the direction of the factory is a fundamental issue. Following the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, only pursuing profit and not serving agricultural production, would lead the enterprise to the capitalist road, harming the country and the people; following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, facing the vast rural areas, and firmly serving agricultural production, would make the enterprise thrive along the socialist road and advance continuously.

    沿着社会主义方向办企业　坚定不移为农业生产服务
    贵州红星拖拉机厂试制成功一机多用柴油机
    这种柴油机体积小，操作方便，维修简单，受到贫下中农欢迎，为山区农业机械化作出贡献
    本报讯　贵州红星拖拉机厂的革命职工，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“农业的根本出路在于机械化”的教导，在有关兄弟单位的大力支持下，克服各种困难，试制成功了我国自行设计的具有先进水平的190风冷柴油机，为山区的农业机械化作出了贡献。
    这种柴油机，重一百零五公斤，体积小，操作方便，维修简单，节省燃料，用途很广。配带拖拉机底盘，成了一台小巧玲珑的拖拉机，旱水两用，能顶六头牛耕田、耙田；配带拖斗，能当运输工具；拖带五瓩发电机，可供二百户照明使用；配带一个小水泵，能灌溉农田二百亩；配带碾米机，每小时碾米六百至八百斤；配带粉碎机，可切草、加工包谷、小麦等，每小时碾面粉一百五十斤。前些日子，190风冷柴油机在农村进行综合利用试验时，受到了贫下中农的赞扬，他们说：“我们早也盼，晚也盼，就盼这个适合我们山区的拖拉机。毛主席他老人家最懂得我们贫下中农的心愿，把拖拉机送来了。”
    过去，这个厂的走资派长期对抗毛主席关于农业机械化方面的指示，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫“利润挂帅”的黑旨意，大搞汽车配件、铝锅、火炉之类的东西，以图赚钱“保饭碗”。他们迷信资产阶级“专家”和反动技术“权威”，在技术问题上，“专家”说了算，工人没有发言权。因此，他们没有生产出一件受贫下中农欢迎，为农业生产服务的农业机械产品。
    去年六月，厂革委会成立后，工人阶级当了家，打倒了走资派和反动技术“权威”。他们带着农业机械厂按什么方向办厂的问题，反复认真地学习了毛主席关于各种拖拉机样式和性能一定要适合我国的气候和地形；并且一定要综合利用的；其成本一定要尽可能降低等教导，深刻认识到，农业机械厂应该面向五亿农民，全心全意地为贫下中农服务，坚决走毛主席指引的农业机械化的道路。
    办厂的方向明确后，广大革命职工又认真地分析了贵州地区的气候和地形等问题，决定试制一机多用的190风冷柴油机，于是组成了以工人为主体，有革命干部和革命技术人员参加的三结合技术管理小组，负责这项新产品的试制工作。
    在试制过程中，厂内设备较差，技术力量也很薄弱，遇到了不少困难，都被用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级克服了。没有模具自己制造，图纸上有不合理的地方，马上就改。金工车间老工人李宗光听说加工装配车间急需一个零件时，不怕疲劳，忘记了下班，连夜苦干，直到第二天上午，把加工好的零件亲自送到装配车间安装好后，才放心地走了。老工人王志镇怀着对毛主席的一颗忠心，废寝忘食，主动设计出冲模六十多付。铸工车间的工人同志，群策群力，发挥三结合的作用，很快地冲破了铝合金熔炼等三项技术难关。
    按原来图纸设计的汽缸套整体，是由合金铝和生铁组成的，这种制作方法，加工复杂，成本高。工人们以敢想敢干的精神，冲破“洋教条”，全部用高磷铁铸成汽缸套整体，这样，加工简单，提高工效，成本降低。但是，散热性能较差，容易造成拉缸、停车事故。为了解决这个问题，厂里试验室的老工人建议取消四个螺孔，改变散热片的布置方式，铸工车间老工人改进了铸造方式，使汽缸套整体达到了质量要求，经过多次试验，完全符合国家标准。一位工程师看了以后敬佩地说：“这是我们过去连想都不敢想的事，你们做出来了，真了不起！”
    从试制成功190风冷柴油机的实践中，他们深深地体会到：办厂的路线问题是个根本的问题。执行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，只追求赚钱，不为农业生产服务，就会把企业引向资本主义方向，害国害民；执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，面向广大农村，坚定不移地为农业生产服务，就会使企业沿着社会主义方向蓬勃发展，不断前进。
