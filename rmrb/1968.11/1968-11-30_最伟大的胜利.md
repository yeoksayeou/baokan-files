The achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the greatest. The spread of Mao Zedong Thought among hundreds of millions of people is the greatest of the great, the greatest of all victories.

Opening the glorious annals of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every page, every line, shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Seven hundred million people have joined this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, with everyone becoming a revolutionary critic. This is the best class in studying Mao Zedong Thought.

In this sharp and intense class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, everyone must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively and creatively at every moment, using Mao Zedong Thought to observe everything, analyze everything, distinguish right from wrong, and discern truth from falsehood; using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie, criticize revisionism, criticize all exploiting class ideologies, and criticize the entire old world; using Mao Zedong Thought to reform literature and art, reform education, and reform all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. The broad masses of revolutionary people learn in struggle and apply in struggle, learning the best and understanding the deepest, making Mao Zedong Thought directly and deeply imprinted in their minds and implemented in their actions.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force for transforming society and the world." The great Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by hundreds of millions of people, will become an endless material force. The struggle practice of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has once again fully proven this. Isn't it true that, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hundreds of millions of people bravely advance, smashing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, eliminating various interferences, and resisting the infiltration of all exploiting class ideologies, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advance from one victory to another? With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the hundreds of millions of people have unearthed a batch of deeply hidden class enemies, overthrown the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places, destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, smashed the plot of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices to restore capitalism, and seized back the power they had usurped, achieving a red land throughout the country.

The great victories achieved by the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have greatly boosted the morale of the people of all countries in the world and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries are trembling with fear and barking madly because they are facing their doom. Within our country, there is also a small handful of class enemies who are the echo of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Their attacks and slanders against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are merely the dying cries of the dying class hearing the sound of their graves being dug. For us, it does not harm us at all. "The monkeys' cries do not stop, but the light boat has already passed through ten thousand mountains." We will more firmly follow Chairman Mao in revolution, letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought redden the whole world!

    最伟大的胜利
    无产阶级文化大革命的成绩最大最大最大。毛泽东思想在亿万人民中迅速地传播，深入人心，是最大中的最大，是一切胜利中最伟大的胜利。
    翻开无产阶级文化大革命的光荣史册，每一页，每一行，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。七亿人民投入这场社会主义条件下无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，人人做革命的批判家，这是进了最好的毛泽东思想学习班。
    在无产阶级文化大革命这场尖锐、激烈的阶级大搏斗中，每个人每时每刻都要带着问题活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想观察一切，分析一切，明辨是非，识别真伪；用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级，批判修正主义，批判一切剥削阶级思想，批判整个旧世界；用毛泽东思想去改革文艺，改革教育，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。广大革命群众在斗争中学，在斗争中用，学得最好，理解得最深，使毛泽东思想最直接、最深刻地印在脑子里，落实在行动上。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”伟大的毛泽东思想被亿万群众所掌握，就能变成无穷无尽的物质力量。这次无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践再一次充分地证明了这一点。不是吗，亿万群众在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下奋勇前进，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线，排除了种种干扰，抵制了一切剥削阶级思想的侵袭，使无产阶级文化大革命从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。亿万群众以毛泽东思想为武器，挖出了一批埋藏得很深很久的阶级敌人，打倒了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在各地的代理人，摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了刘少奇及其同伙复辟资本主义的阴谋，夺回了被他们篡夺了的那部分权力，实现了全国山河一片红。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民所取得的伟大胜利，大长了世界各国人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派吓得发抖了，气得狂吠了，因为他们面临着灭顶之灾。在我们国家内部，也有那么一小撮阶级敌人，他们是帝、修、反的应声虫。他们对无产阶级文化大革命的攻击和诬蔑，只不过是垂死阶级听到掘墓声而发出的哀鸣。对于我们，却无损于一根毫毛。“两岸猿声啼不住，轻舟已过万重山。”我们将更加坚定地紧紧跟着毛主席干革命，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想染红全世界！
