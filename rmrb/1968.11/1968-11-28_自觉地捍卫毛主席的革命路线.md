With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, we have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and the important editorial "Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" from the central two newspapers and one journal that conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through our study, we have further realized that class struggles in society inevitably reflect in the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The history of our Party is a history of the struggle between the two lines. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has developed through struggles against the opportunist lines of "Left" and "Right" deviations, as well as the revisionist line. The history of struggle has proven that advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line leads to victory for the revolution, enabling the proletariat to seize and consolidate power. Conversely, if we deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolution will fail, and the proletariat will lose power. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the soul of the proletariat and the lifeline of the working people. In his report to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee, Chairman Mao deeply summarized the struggle between the two lines within the Party during the democratic revolution period and foresaw the new situation of class struggle after victory, pointing out the direction for the Party and the people to advance. At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about to achieve comprehensive victory, studying this brilliant document is of profound significance in carrying out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out wisely: "The experience of history is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses." Strengthening the education of the broad revolutionary masses on the struggle between the two lines, enabling the masses to further understand the long-term and complex nature of the struggle between the two lines, and the essence of the struggle between the two lines, is the fundamental guarantee for the socialist state to remain unchanged for thousands of years. Every revolutionary fighter must raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to clearly distinguish between love and hate, maintain a firm stance, and always stand on the side of the proletariat and the masses. Heroes Li Wen Zhong, Li Cong Quan, and Chen Dian Kui have set a brilliant example for us. How do we follow the path of the heroes? We feel that the most fundamental and primary thing is to have boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, to elevate the struggle between the two lines to the height of consolidating power and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and to never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship at any time. This is the most fundamental awakening of a revolutionary fighter.

Following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," we bring the problem of the line struggle to our hearts, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, and ignite a revolution in the depths of our souls, fighting selfishness at its core, and establishing public-mindedness at its root. We deeply realize that the historical struggles between the two lines have always revolved around the issue of power. The bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, while the proletariat seeks to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Liu Shaoqi vigorously promoted the "Six Black Articles," pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, with the evil intention of making us follow the path of the modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union, restoring capitalism in China.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has thoroughly smashed Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have completely collapsed. However, we must not relax our fighting spirit. The current struggle, criticism, and reform is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines. We are determined to, in this great struggle, criticism, and reform, seriously study Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, deeply understand the history of the struggle between the two lines, use Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship as a powerful ideological weapon, further criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminate its poison, and fight against the "self" in our minds. We will consciously implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    自觉地捍卫毛主席的革命路线

    我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，一次又一次地学习了毛主席的光辉著作《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和传达了毛主席最新指示的中央两报一刊的重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》。通过学习，我们进一步认识到：社会上的阶级斗争，必然地要在党内两条路线斗争中反映出来。我们党的历史，就是两条路线的斗争史。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是在同“左”右倾机会主义路线、修正主义路线作斗争中发展起来的。斗争的历史证明，沿着毛主席的革命路线前进，革命就胜利，无产阶级就能夺取政权，巩固政权；反之，如果背离了毛主席的革命路线，革命就要失败，无产阶级就会丧失政权。毛主席的革命路线是无产阶级的灵魂，是劳动人民的生命线。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，深刻地总结了民主革命时期党内两条路线的斗争，并预见到胜利以后阶级斗争的新形势，指明了党和人民前进的方向。在无产阶级文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的今天，学习这个光辉的文献，对于把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，有着极其深远的意义。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近英明指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”对广大革命群众加强两条路线斗争的教育，使群众进一步了解两条路线斗争的长期性和复杂性，以及两条路线斗争的实质，这是保证社会主义国家千秋万代永不变色的根本保证。每个革命战士，只有提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，才能爱憎分明，立场坚定，始终站在无产阶级和人民大众的立场上。英雄李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎为我们树立了光辉榜样。如何走英雄的道路？我们体会到，最根本、最首要的就是对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，把两条路线斗争提到巩固政权、防止资本主义复辟的高度来认识，任何时候念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，这是革命战士最根本的觉悟。
    我们遵照毛主席“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的伟大教导，带着路线斗争的问题，活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论，在灵魂深处爆发革命，斗私斗在要害处，立公立在根本上。我们深刻认识到，历来的两条路线斗争，都是围绕着一个政权问题，资产阶级要颠覆无产阶级专政，无产阶级则要巩固无产阶级专政。刘少奇竭力鼓吹黑“六论”，大肆推行资产阶级反动路线，其罪恶目的，就是妄图叫我们走苏联现代修正主义集团正在走的道路，在中国复辟资本主义。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线彻底粉碎了刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，刘少奇和他的同伙彻底垮台了。但是，我们务必不要松懈自己的战斗意志。当前正在进行的斗、批、改，就是两条路线斗争的继续。我们决心在这个伟大的斗、批、改的革命中，认真学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，深刻领会两条路线斗争史，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论作为强大的思想武器，进一步批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，肃清它的流毒，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，自觉执行毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
