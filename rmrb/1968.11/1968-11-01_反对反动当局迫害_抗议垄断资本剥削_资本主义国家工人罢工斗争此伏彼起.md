Workers in capitalist countries are engaged in frequent strike struggles to oppose the oppression of reactionary regimes and to fight for their own rights and interests.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, workers in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Australia, Spain, and other countries continue to wage strike struggles, opposing the oppression of reactionary regimes and fighting for their own rights and interests.

In Argentina, 7,800 workers at the "La Plata" refinery have defied the threats of the reactionary regime and continued their strike, which began on September 25, demanding that the company cancel measures to extend working hours and intensify the exploitation of workers. The strike committee issued a statement on the 20th, exposing the Argentine government's attempt to hand over the refinery to foreign business owners. 3,500 oil workers in Mendoza Province announced that they would go on strike to support the just struggle of the "La Plata" oil workers.

Workers at an electric machinery factory in Rosario, Argentina, occupied the factory on the 22nd and engaged in fierce battles with the police who attempted to suppress them.

All employees of the American-owned Chilean Electric Power Company and electric machinery technicians of the Chilean National Electric Power Company in the Chilean capital of Santiago went on strike on the 23rd, demanding wage increases.

Workers at a shoe factory in Valdivia City went on strike for six days to protest the dismissal of workers and then occupied the factory.

The Workers' Union of the same province in Ecuador announced a strike on the 20th to support the struggle of the workers at the Benus Shoe Factory. The workers of this shoe factory had demanded wage increases, but their demands were persistently rejected by the management.

In Uruguay, newspaper printing workers in the capital Montevideo defied the government's ban on strikes and went on strike starting on the 20th, demanding wage increases. Journalists also went on strike simultaneously. By the 23rd, this city had gone four consecutive days without publishing any newspapers.

In Australia, 80,000 railway workers went on a 24-hour nationwide strike on the 28th, demanding wage increases.

Striking workers, despite the threats of the reactionary regime, held mass rallies across the country to protest the regime's arbitrary rejection of workers' reasonable demands.

In northern Spain, thousands of coal miners in Oviedo defied the threats and persecution of the fascist regime and continued their strike.

This strike, which recently broke out, is a strong protest by Spanish coal miners against the national monopoly capital's ruthless exploitation of workers' blood and sweat. By the 23rd, the number of miners on strike had increased to more than 8,000. In the past week or so, the coal miners in Oviedo have continued their struggle. On the 31st, the reactionary authorities of the coal mining company arbitrarily announced the closure of a giant mine in Oviedo, effectively dismissing more than 400 striking workers from this mine, in an attempt to suppress the workers' strike struggle. However, the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The coal miners continue to fight fearlessly.

    反对反动当局迫害　抗议垄断资本剥削
    资本主义国家工人罢工斗争此伏彼起
    据新华社讯　阿根廷、智利、厄瓜多尔、乌拉圭、澳大利亚、西班牙等国家的工人继续开展罢工斗争，反对反动当局的压迫和争取切身权益。
    阿根廷“拉普拉塔”炼油厂的七千八百名工人，不顾反动当局的威吓，继续坚持从九月二十五日开始的罢工斗争，要求厂方取消延长工作时间等加紧剥削工人的措施。工人罢工委员会二十日发表公报，揭露阿根廷政府企图把炼油厂交给外国企业主。门多萨省的三千五百名石油工人宣布将举行罢工，声援“拉普拉塔”石油工人的正义斗争。
    阿根廷罗萨利奥一家电机厂的罢工工人在二十二日占领了工厂，同企图镇压他们的警察部队展开了激烈的搏斗。
    智利首都圣地亚哥的美资智利电力公司的全体雇员和智利国家电力公司的电机技术员，二十三日举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    瓦尔迪维亚市一家鞋厂的工人为抗议解雇工人，举行了六天罢工后占领了工厂。
    厄瓜多尔同古拉瓦省的工人联合会二十日宣布罢工，支持贝努斯鞋厂工人的斗争。这个鞋厂的工人曾提出了增加工资等要求，但一直遭到资方的顽固拒绝。
    乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚的报纸印刷工人不顾当局禁止罢工的法令，从二十日起又举行罢工，要求增加工资。新闻记者也同时举行罢工。到二十三日止，这个城市已连续四天没有报纸出版。
    澳大利亚八万名铁路工人二十八日举行了二十四小时全国性总罢工，要求增加工资。
    罢工工人不顾反动当局的威胁，在全国各地举行群众集会，抗议当局横蛮拒绝工人的合理要求。
    西班牙北部奥维亚多的数千名煤矿工人，不顾法西斯当局的威胁和迫害，继续坚持罢工。
    这次不久前爆发的罢工斗争，是西班牙煤矿工人对国家垄断资本不顾工人死活榨取工人血汗的强烈抗议。到二十三日，参加罢工的矿工已增加到八千多人。最近一个多星期以来，奥维亚多的煤矿工人仍然在坚持斗争。三十一日，煤矿公司反动当局悍然宣布封闭奥维亚多的一个巨大的矿井，从而变相解雇了这个矿井的四百多名罢工工人，妄想借此把工人的罢工斗争镇压下去。但是，压迫越大，反抗越强，煤矿工人仍在毫不畏惧地坚持斗争。
