		Tens of millions of Americans are struggling on the brink of death. Their daily food intake does not exceed a bowl of porridge.

		People's Daily reports: The West German bourgeois newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau" recently published an article titled "Children Sometimes Cry," revealing that tens of millions of people in the United States are starving.

		The article states: "In the country known as the richest on Earth, the United States, tens of millions of people are starving, children are dying because they have almost nothing to eat, and people are suffering from diseases caused by a lack of vitamins and protein."

		The newspaper writes: "One out of every twenty Americans is starving." "At night, they go to bed hungry, and in the morning, they get up hungry. They work and study hungry, and their daily food intake is almost nothing more than a bowl of porridge. There are a million such starving Americans. In states like South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, and along the East Coast of the United States, you can find such starving Americans."

		The article also discusses many impoverished families whose children, due to a lack of sufficient food, are malnourished and suffer from diseases: "Many children in the United States cry from hunger. Teachers say that students sometimes faint during class. They hardly eat anything all day. Some children suddenly fall ill. They lack basic food. Many children sleep in school. They lack the energy to attend classes. The skin, eyes, ears, heart, bones, lungs, kidneys, and brain of the children are often severely damaged. Hunger constantly accompanies them."

		It says: "Hunger begins in the womb. Mothers give birth to children who are already damaged in body and mind. Infants grow up malnourished. Children are sent to the hospital due to deformities and obesity. They suffer from diseases due to a lack of protein."

		The tragic conditions of the American working people revealed by this West German bourgeois newspaper are enough to show the deep disasters that the evil rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie has brought to the broad masses of American working people. The so-called "war on poverty" propagated by the American ruling class is completely a deception of the American people. The oppressed people of the United States are awakening. They are increasingly realizing that only by uniting and fighting resolutely to overthrow the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie and destroy the colonialist, imperialist system can the oppressed people of the United States achieve thorough liberation.

    千百万美国人民挣扎在死亡线上
    他们的每天饭食不超过一顿稀粥
    本报讯　西德的资产阶级报纸《法兰克福评论报》最近发表了一篇题为《孩子们有时候啼哭》的文章，透露了在美国有上千万的人在挨饿的情况。
    文章说：“就在被称之为地球上最豪富的美国，千百万人在挨饿，儿童们在死亡，因为他们很少有吃的东西，人们遭受着疾病的折磨，这是缺少维生素和蛋白质的后果。”
    这家报纸写道：“每二十个美国人中就有一个在挨饿”。“晚上，他们饿着肚子睡觉，早晨饿着肚子起床，他们饿着肚子劳动，饿着肚子学习，他们每天的饭食几乎不超过一顿稀粥，这样的人有一千万。在南达科他州、科罗拉多州、新墨西哥州、亚利桑那州、阿肯色州、田纳西州、亚拉巴马州和美国的东海岸都可以找到这样的挨饿的美国人。”
    文章还谈到许多贫苦人家的儿童，因为缺乏足够的食物而发育不良和遭受疾病的折磨：“美国有许多儿童由于饥饿而啼哭。教师们说，学生们有时在上课时就晕倒。他们整天几乎吃不到一点东西。有些孩子有时突然病倒。他们缺乏基本的食粮。许多孩子在学校里睡觉。他们没有精力去上课。孩子们的皮肤、眼睛、耳朵、心脏、骨头、肺部、肾脏和脑都经常遭到严重的损害。因为饥饿经常伴随着他们。”
    它说：“饥饿早已始于母体。母亲们生下的孩子在体质上和精神上已受到损害。婴儿的成长是发育不良的。小孩由于衰残现象和身体臃肿而被送进医院。他们由于缺乏蛋白质而遭受着疾病的折磨。”
    这家西德资产阶级报纸所透露的美国劳动人民的一些悲惨状况，也足以说明美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治为美国广大劳动人民所带来的深重灾难。美国统治集团大肆宣传的所谓“向贫穷开战”，完全是一个愚弄美国人民的骗局。美国的被压迫人民正在觉醒。他们日益认识到，只有团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国的被压迫人民才能取得彻底的解放。
