The People's Daily published a recommendation from primary school teachers Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu on downloading primary schools to the production brigade, and added an editorial note. This news reached Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu's hometown, the Maliji Production Brigade of Maji Commune, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students were all overjoyed and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They were deeply moved and held a serious study and discussion session that very night.

Chairman Mao's Proletarian Educational Line Guides Us Forward

Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu (primary school teachers): Our recommendation as two public primary school teachers has been given such importance by the Party Central Committee's organ, the People's Daily, and proposed for nationwide discussion. This makes us extremely excited. Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, supports the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most, giving us boundless strength. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the countryside, schools should be run by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the Maliji Primary School of Maliji Commune, under the leadership of the Maliji Brigade Revolutionary Committee, has focused on issues such as who to rely on for running schools, whom the schools should serve, and what kind of successors to cultivate. We have thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, further raising our class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. In practice, we deeply feel that if rural public primary schools are not downloaded to the production brigade, we cannot truly and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution. Our country is a socialist country, and rural primary schools should be part of the production brigade. We believe this is a fundamental issue in the rural proletarian educational revolution, and it is necessary to report this situation and our views to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Therefore, we wrote this letter. The recommendation of these two ordinary teachers has been given such importance by the People's Daily, further proving a great truth: "The basic principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." In the future, we will definitely continue to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and make new contributions to the rural educational revolution.

Public Primary Schools Must Be Downloaded to the Production Brigade

Zhu Guangyun (primary school teacher): For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places have pushed a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines, making rural public primary schools detached from proletarian politics, detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and detached from productive labor, turning them into bastions for cultivating bourgeois successors. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." However, Liu Shaoqi vigorously spread the reactionary fallacy of "reading books to become officials." Under this poisonous influence, teachers teach for "promotion," and many students study to "become officials." Schools are originally in the countryside, but students' hearts yearn for the city, thinking of becoming cadres, earning wages, living in big houses, and not laboring.

We rural public primary school teachers, although we see the poor and lower-middle peasants every day, our feelings, style, and thoughts are completely at odds with theirs. The poor and lower-middle peasants do not welcome the students we teach, saying, "Graduates of primary school, good for nothing," and they do not welcome teachers like us, calling us "foreign teachers." To change this "three-detached" phenomenon, we must download public primary schools to the production brigade, letting the poor and lower-middle peasants directly manage the schools and thoroughly change the situation where bourgeois intellectuals dominate the schools.

Ma Guangtian (poor peasant): The past revisionist educational line was certainly not for us poor and lower-middle peasants. It was really difficult for our children to go to school! They stipulated that if the score was not enough, they had to drop out; if the tuition was not paid, they had to drop out; if the age was too old, they had to drop out. There were all kinds of tricks, opposing us poor and lower-middle peasants at every turn. Due to these unreasonable regulations, in 1961, our village's public school enrolled 48 fifth-grade students, but in less than a year, they were reduced to only 11. Under the revisionist educational line, some children of poor and lower-middle peasants, even if they went to school, could not carry on our work. The more they studied, the more distant they became from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and even when they came home, they found their mother's food dirty. This makes us think: What class did the past revisionist educational line serve? Whose successors did it cultivate? We must thoroughly criticize this reactionary line and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. We poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools is to implement Chairman Mao's educational line. However, if the rural schools are not run by the production brigade, we cannot truly implement the great instruction of our great leader Chairman Mao about "the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools," which is not conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Therefore, the path of downloading public primary schools to the production brigade must be taken.

Production Brigade Management is Much Better than Public Management

Quan Tinghuai and Quan Zhitao (poor peasants): Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Downloading rural public primary schools to the production brigade can firmly grasp the power of rural education in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly changing the situation where bourgeois intellectuals dominate everything. After downloading public primary schools to the production brigade, we can better implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," making students "not only study literature but also study industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie," cultivating students who can both read and fight, truly becoming reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Ma Hanjun (poor peasant): Downloading public primary schools to the production brigade is great. This way, teachers can return to their own brigade, both teaching and being commune members, working and earning points just like everyone else, with no special treatment, setting a good example for students after graduation to be farmers. This way, what teachers teach, what students learn, and what they actually do can be well combined, thoroughly changing the phenomenon of public primary school teaching being detached from reality.

Sun Xingrui (self-supported teacher): Based on my personal experience, rural primary school teachers can only benefit from working in the production brigade, living among the poor and lower-middle peasants, and not being detached from labor, to receive the poor and lower-middle peasants' re-education. We self-supported teachers now mostly teach in the morning, work in the production team in the afternoon, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the commune members in the evening. This way, we often have the opportunity to receive the poor and lower-middle peasants' education and help, changing our non-proletarian thoughts. After downloading public primary schools to the production brigade, teachers can receive the poor and lower-middle peasants' re-education just like us. This is not only a good thing for public primary school teachers but also has extremely far-reaching significance for cultivating the next generation.

We Can Certainly Manage the Downloaded Schools Better

Ma Zhiquan (brigade revolutionary committee director): Downloading public primary schools to the production brigade has many advantages. But now some people doubt whether the production brigade can manage the downloaded schools well. This doubt is groundless. We hope those with such wrong views come to the countryside to walk around and listen to the opinions of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants' answer is firm: With Chairman Mao supporting us, we not only can run primary schools but also definitely can run them better than when they were publicly managed. From the political aspect, we poor and lower-middle peasants hate the revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi the most, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and implement it the most resolutely and seriously. Therefore, the bitter history of our ancestors tells us deeply that if the cultural power is not firmly grasped, the political power cannot be consolidated; the cultural power is grasped by which class, it cultivates successors for that class. With an unyielding red heart for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the poor and lower-middle peasants fear neither heaven nor earth, and can overcome any difficulty. From the economic aspect, now the collective economy is developing more and more, and the production brigade can afford it. Our brigade has about 200 students. After the public primary school is downloaded to our brigade, it only needs 300-400 yuan of funds per year and about 2,000 catties of grain for the teachers. These expenses are completely affordable for our brigade. At the same time, three or four years ago, our brigade already ran two self-supported primary schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants have accumulated a lot of experience in running schools, and we are completely confident in leading the downloaded public primary school well. We actively support the initiative of the two revolutionary teachers, Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, and will definitely run the Maliji Primary School downloaded to our brigade even better!

　　把公办小学下放到大队来办是农村教育革命的方向
　　山东嘉祥县马集公社马集大队贫下中农、革命教师座谈纪要
    《人民日报》发表了小学教师侯振民、王庆余两同志关于把公办小学下放到大队来办的革命建议，并且为此加了编者按，这一喜讯传到侯振民、王庆余所在的山东省嘉祥县马集公社马集大队，广大贫下中农和革命师生无不欢欣鼓舞，千遍万遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们心潮澎湃，连夜进行了认真的学习座谈。
    毛主席的无产阶级教育路线指引我们前进
    侯振民、王庆余（小学教师）：我们两个公办小学教师的建议，能够得到党中央机关报这样重视，提出要在全国展开讨论，这使我们万分激动。我们伟大领袖毛主席最信任群众，最支持群众，最尊重群众的首创精神，给了我们无穷无尽的力量。毛主席教导我们：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”遵照毛主席的教导，我们马集公社马集小学在马集大队革委会的领导下，围绕着依靠什么人办学、学校向什么人开门、培养什么样的接班人等问题，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇所推行的修正主义教育路线进行了大揭发、大批判，使我们进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。在实践过程中，我们深深感觉到农村公办小学如果不下放到大队来办，就不能真正全面地落实毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示。我们的国家是社会主义国家，农村小学应当是大队的一部分。我们认为，这是农村无产阶级教育革命的一个根本性的大问题，有必要向毛主席和党中央汇报一下这个情况和我们的看法，所以就写了这封信。我们这两个普通教师的建议得到《人民日报》这样重视，进一步证明了一个伟大的真理：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”今后我们一定要沿着毛主席的无产阶级教育路线继续前进，在农村教育革命中作出新的贡献。
    必须把公办小学下放到大队来办
    朱光运（小学教师）：长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在各地的代理人推行了一整套反革命修正主义教育路线，使广大农村公办小学脱离无产阶级政治，脱离贫下中农，脱离生产劳动，成了培养资产阶级接班人的阵地。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”但是刘少奇却竭力散布“读书做官论”。在这种反动谬论的毒害下，教师为“升官”而教，不少学生为“做官”而学。学校本来是在农村，但学生的心却向往着城市，想的是当干部，挣工资，住大楼，不劳动。
    我们农村公办小学教师虽然整天与贫下中农见面，但感情、作风、思想都和贫下中农格格不入。贫下中农不欢迎我们教出来的学生，说：“高小毕业生，干啥啥不中”，更不欢迎我们这样的教师，称我们是“洋先生”。要改变这种“三脱离”的现象，就必须把公办小学下放到生产大队，让贫下中农直接管理学校，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的局面。
    马广田（贫农社员）：过去的修正主义教育路线可不是为咱贫下中农服务的。咱贫下中农的子女上学可真不容易啊！他们规定什么分数考不够就得退学，学费缴不起就得退学，年龄大了也得退学。真是花样百出，处处同咱贫下中农作对。由于这些不合理的规定，一九六一年俺村的这所公办学校招收了四十八名五年级学生，不到一年的时间，就被他们退得只剩十一名了。在修正主义教育路线下，有的贫下中农的子女就是上了学，也不能接我们的班，他们越学和贫下中农的感情越远，甚至来到家看到他母亲做的饭也嫌脏了。这就值得我们想一想：过去修正主义教育路线，到底是为那个阶级服务的，培养的是谁家的接班人。我们一定要批臭这条反动路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，我们贫下中农管理学校就是要贯彻毛主席的教育路线。但是，农村的学校如果不由大队来办，就不能真正实现伟大领袖毛主席关于“贫下中农管理学校”的伟大指示，不利于贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，所以公办小学下放到大队来办这条路非走不可。
    大队办比公办好得多
    权廷怀、权志太（贫农社员）：毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”农村公办小学下放到大队来办，就可以把农村教育大权，牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里，彻底改变那种资产阶级知识分子一统天下的局面。公办小学下放到大队后，能更好地贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，使学生“不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”，培养出来的学生能文能武，真正成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    马汉君（贫农社员）：公办小学下放到大队来办，太好了。这样，教师就可回到本队，既当教师，又当社员，跟大家一样，评工记分，没有一点特殊的地方，给学生毕业后当农民做出了很好的榜样。这样，老师教的、学生学的和实际做的，就能很好地结合起来，彻底改变公办小学教学脱离实际的现象。
    孙兴瑞（民办教师）：根据我的亲身体会，农村小学教师只有工作在大队，生活在贫下中农之中，不脱离劳动，才有利于接受贫下中农的再教育。我们民办教师，现在绝大多数是上午上课，下午在生产队劳动，晚上又向社员宣传毛泽东思想。这样，就经常有机会接受贫下中农的教育和帮助，改造自己的非无产阶级思想。公办小学下放到大队后，教师就能和我们一样地接受贫下中农的再教育。这不但对公办小学教师是一件大好事，对培养下一代更有极为深远的意义。
    咱们一定能把下放的小学管得更好
    马志全（大队革委会主任）：把公办小学下放到大队来办，好处很多。但现在还有人对大队能不能办好下放的小学表示怀疑，这种怀疑是毫无根据的。我们希望有这种错误看法的人到农村来走一走、看一看，听听咱贫下中农的意见。贫下中农的回答是坚定的：有毛主席给咱们撑腰，咱们不仅能办小学，而且一定能够办得比公办时更好。从政治方面来说，咱们贫下中农对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的修正主义教育路线最恨，对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线最忠，执行得最坚决、最认真。因此，祖祖辈辈的血泪史深刻地告诉我们，文权掌不牢，政权就保不住；文权掌握在什么阶级手里，就为那一个阶级培养接班人。有了无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一颗红心，贫下中农就天不怕，地不怕，什么困难也能克服。再从经济方面来说，现在集体经济越来越发展，大队是能够负担得了的。咱们大队约有二百个学生，公办小学下放给咱大队后，一年只要三四百元经费，供给教师二千斤左右的口粮就够了。这些开支，从咱们大队来看，是完全能够负担的。同时，三、四年前，咱大队就办了两所民办小学，贫下中农已经积累了不少办学经验，对领导好下放的公办小学是完全有把握的。我们大队积极支持侯振民、王庆余两位革命教师的倡议，一定要把下放到咱们大队的马集小学办得好上加好！
