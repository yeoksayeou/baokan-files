Shandong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi cotton areas have overcome natural disasters and achieved a bumper cotton harvest. Broad masses of commune members, filled with revolutionary fervor, are enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state.

	Shandong Province's cotton-growing areas have seen broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively selling new cotton to the state, supporting the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. By October 25, the province's cotton procurement plan had been completed by 85%, an 18.1% increase over the same period last year. Counties such as Huimin, Zhanhua, Changle, Jiaozhou, Pingdu, and Changyi have already exceeded their cotton procurement targets.

	This year, Shandong's cotton production faced a severe drought not seen in decades. Relying on the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, under the leadership of various levels of revolutionary committees and with the help of the People's Liberation Army agricultural support troops, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants displayed tremendous revolutionary spirit, battling the heavens and the earth, and ultimately achieved a good cotton harvest.

	After the new cotton matured, various production teams in Shandong's cotton-growing areas extensively organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "must grasp cotton production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." They combined these teachings with the class struggle in their regions and units, severely criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong who opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and promoted "material incentives" in cotton production and procurement. This raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, quickly sparking a wave of selling cotton to the state. This year, the speed and quality of selling new cotton to the state in Shandong's cotton-growing areas are unprecedented.

	Zhejiang Province's cotton-growing areas, riding the winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have again achieved a bumper cotton harvest. Broad masses of commune members, filled with revolutionary fervor, are enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state. By October 25, the province had already completed and exceeded the annual cotton procurement plan. The quality of the cotton is also better than in previous years. Currently, broad masses of cotton farmers are continuing their efforts, strengthening the late-stage cotton picking, ensuring fine picking and storage, and striving to sell more cotton to the state, supporting the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhejiang's cotton-growing areas actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, extensively launching the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" mass movement, and their political and ideological awareness has reached unprecedented heights. They have established the idea of growing cotton for the revolution, overcoming spring droughts, low temperatures, and pest infestations, and achieving a bumper cotton harvest.

	Revolutionary committees at various levels in Zhejiang's cotton-producing areas, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," before the cotton picking and procurement, universally organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes and cotton farmer representative meetings at the county or commune level. They carried out class education and revolutionary criticism, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" and "must grasp cotton production." The old cotton-growing areas along the coast of Hangzhou Bay, such as Cixi, Xiaoshan, Haiyan, and Zhenhai, mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, denouncing the evils of landlords and capitalists oppressing and exploiting cotton farmers in the old society. They severely criticized the "three freedoms and one contract" and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in cotton production and procurement, raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, greatly accelerating the pace of cotton picking and selling.

	Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi's cotton-growing areas are enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state. So far, the amount of new cotton they have sold to the state is double that of the same period last year, and the quality has also significantly improved. Eighteen major cotton-producing counties, including Gao'an, have completed and exceeded their annual selling quotas.

	This year, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi's cotton-growing areas, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "must grasp cotton production," have vigorously grasped the revolution and promoted production, overcoming natural disasters such as summer floods, and achieving a bumper cotton harvest. In the joyous days of harvest, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, filled with limitless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have launched a wave of selling new cotton to the state. They have also organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, severely criticizing the "keep more, sell less" and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, correctly handling the relationships between the state, the collective, and the individual. To facilitate the sale of new cotton by the masses, procurement departments at various places have universally set up more procurement stations, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.
