The revolutionary workers of the Vibrator Factory in Foshan, Guangdong Province, have successfully designed and trial-produced a high-frequency vibrator of advanced level, which has recently been put into production.

With the rapid development of socialist construction in our country, factories, transportation, construction, and other sectors urgently need high-frequency vibrators. The revolutionary workers of this factory, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "self-reliance," began the trial production of high-frequency vibrators before the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, breaking through the obstruction of the capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeois "authorities" in technology. After the proletarian revolutionary factions took power during the Cultural Revolution, the workers, following Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," fiercely criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "experts running the factory." They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and "On Practice," and Chairman Mao's comments on the article "Who Says Chickens Can't Fly," using Mao Zedong Thought to attack the technical difficulties in the trial production of high-frequency vibrators. Finally, they successfully produced the high-frequency vibrator.

    高频振动器
    广东省佛山市振动器厂的革命职工自行设计并试制成功了具有先进水平的高频振动器，最近已投入生产。
    随着我国社会主义建设的飞速发展，工厂、交通、建筑等部门迫切需要高频振动器。这个工厂的广大革命职工遵照毛主席“自力更生”的伟大教导，在无产阶级文化大革命开始前，就冲破工厂党内走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的阻挠，开始了高频振动器的试制工作。文化大革命中无产阶级革命派掌权后，工人们遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠批叛徒刘少奇的“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货，反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》、《实践论》和毛主席为《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文写的按语，用毛泽东思想猛攻试制高频振动器的技术难关，终于把高频振动器试制成功。
