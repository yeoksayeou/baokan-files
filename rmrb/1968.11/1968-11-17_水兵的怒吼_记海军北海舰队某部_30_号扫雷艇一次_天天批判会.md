On the 30th mine sweeper of the North Sea Fleet, another battle to criticize Liu Shaoqi has begun.

A blackboard is hung on the high-rising gun barrel, with the words: "Overthrow the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi! Thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's 'philosophy of survival'."

Political instructor Liu Yanmeng, with great revolutionary indignation, said: The great traitor, great spy, and great scab Liu Shaoqi has been loudly advocating the reactionary "philosophy of survival," vilely shouting about "first is to live, second is to work" and "in some turning points, in some situations... it is very natural to have some wavering and changes." We must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies.

As soon as the political instructor finished speaking, a roar of "Overthrow the great traitor Liu Shaoqi!" and "Thoroughly criticize and expose the 'traitor philosophy' and 'philosophy of survival'!" erupted.

Gunner Guo Zhiquan fired the first "shot." He immediately stood up and loudly recited Chairman Mao's brilliant directive: "A communist should be open-hearted, honest, and active, putting revolutionary interests first, and subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests." He continued: Liu Shaoqi's "philosophy of survival" is that survival is everything, and for survival, one can betray the revolution and sell out comrades. He attempts to use this extremely reactionary fallacy to poison our party members and sabotage the proletarian revolutionary cause, which is truly detestable and despicable! Let me tell you, Liu Shaoqi! We communist party members and revolutionary soldiers have long seen through your traitorous face and your counter-revolutionary black heart.

In the midst of a wave of requests to speak, soldier Wang Zhanzheng and deputy captain Li Zengwen, holding the Little Red Book, leaped up and used the deeds of the good squad leader and communist party member Gao Chenglin, who twice saved people from fires and four times jumped into the icy sea to rescue fishermen and fishing boats, to criticize Liu Shaoqi's "traitor philosophy" and "philosophy of survival."

One day, Gao Chenglin and his comrades suddenly discovered that the anchor chain of a fishing boat sheltering in the harbor from the wind had been broken by the waves. The boat was drifting with the waves towards the rocks. It seemed that the fishing boat was about to be "destroyed," and the lives of the fishermen were also in great danger. At this critical moment, the five shining golden words "Serve the People" gave him endless strength. Without hesitation, he was the first to jump into the sea and engage in a struggle with the strong winds and waves. He was swallowed by the waves several times, but he firmly grasped the rope. The wind blew harder and the waves grew higher. A giant wave crashed down on Gao Chenglin. Behind him was a large rock, and in an instant, there was a possibility of shipwreck and death. The people on the scene shouted, "Let go! Let go!" At this crucial moment, Gao Chenglin thought: I, Gao Chenglin, can give up my life, but I cannot, at this critical moment, abandon my loyalty to Chairman Mao. He and his comrades used all their strength to turn the bow of the ship and pushed the fishing boat away from the danger, ensuring the safety of the fishermen and the fishing boat.

This March, near the garrison, the grain and oil processing plant of Hongqi Brigade in Chengguan Commune suddenly caught fire. Communist party member Gao Chenglin rushed to the scene and repeatedly charged into the fire to save the collective property of the people. The wooden beams, tiles, and ceiling of the roof fell down with a crash, but our Gao Chenglin was not a coward who "first wants to live." His mind was only on the people. To ensure that the people's interests were not harmed, he repeatedly charged into the fire and carried out materials. Gao Chenglin, with his loyalty to the party, the people, and Chairman Mao, composed a magnificent song of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the most powerful refutation of Liu Shaoqi's "traitor philosophy" and "philosophy of survival"!

"Learn from comrade Gao Chenglin!" "Overthrow the great traitor Liu Shaoqi!" "Defend Chairman Mao!" The battle slogans echoed through the air.

New party members Zhang Peiqi and Wang Zhixiong, who joined the party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seized the opportunity to "fire a shot," indignantly saying: The traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "first is to live, second is to work" is the same as Khrushchev's so-called "what principles if the head is cut off." This great traitor Liu Shaoqi is trying to sell his "traitor philosophy" and "philosophy of survival" to corrupt the broad masses of party members and revolutionary people, making us into cowards who fear death and betray the revolution, so that he can usurp the party, usurp the government, usurp the military, and restore capitalism. We will not be fooled. We must take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, thoroughly reform our worldview, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The surging waves, the battle is still intense. The crew of the 30th mine sweeper, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticized and exposed the great traitor, great spy, and great scab Liu Shaoqi. The battle slogans "Overthrow Liu Shaoqi!" and "Thoroughly purge the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top handful of capitalist roaders within the party!" echoed through the air above the military port.

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

　　水兵的怒吼
　　——记海军北海舰队某部30号扫雷艇一次“天天批判会”
    北海舰队30号扫雷艇上，一场批判刘少奇的战斗又打响了。
    那高高扬起的炮口上，挂着一块黑板，上面写着：“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！彻底批透刘少奇的‘活命哲学’。”
    指导员刘延孟怀着极大的革命义愤说：大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，大肆鼓吹反动的“活命哲学”，卑鄙无耻地叫嚷什么“第一是要命，第二是工作”“在某种转变关头，在某种情况下……发生一些动摇和变化，也是很自然的。”我们一定要把大叛徒刘少奇的反动谬论，批深批透。
    指导员的话音刚落，立刻爆发出“打倒大叛徒刘少奇！”“彻底批臭‘叛徒哲学’、‘活命哲学’”的怒吼声。
    枪炮兵郭志清打了头一“炮”。他一上去就高声背诵毛主席的光辉指示：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。他接着说：刘少奇鼓吹的“活命哲学”是，活命就是一切，为了活命，可以背叛革命，出卖同志。他妄图用这种反动透顶的谬论来毒害我们的党员，破坏无产阶级革命事业，真是可恨可恶！告诉你，刘少奇！我们共产党员、革命战士早就看清了你的叛徒嘴脸，看穿了你的反革命黑心。
    在一片要求发言的声浪中，战士王展政和副艇长李曾文手捧红色宝书，一跃而起，以艇上的好班长、共产党员高成林同志，两次为人民救火，四次在严寒的冬天跳进海里抢救渔民和渔船的事迹，批判刘少奇的“叛徒哲学”和“活命哲学”。
    一天，高成林和战友们突然发现一只在港里避风的渔船锚缆被风浪打断了。船随着海浪，冲向礁石。眼看渔船将要“粉身碎骨”，渔民的生命也十分危险。在这紧急关头，“为人民服务”这五个金光闪闪的大字给了他无穷无尽的力量。他毫不犹豫地第一个跳进了大海，与大风大浪展开搏斗，他几次被海浪吞没，但他死死抓住了缆绳。风越刮越大，浪越来越高，一个巨浪劈顶盖脑地向高成林压过来。他的背后是一块大礁石，刹那间就有可能船毁人亡。在场救渔船的人高喊着：“撒手！撒手！”在这关键的一刹那，高成林想的是：我高成林可以不要生命，但决不能在关键的时候，丢掉忠于毛主席的红心。他和战友用尽全身力量，拨转了船头，把渔船推离了险地，保证了渔民和渔船的安全。
    今年三月驻地附近城关公社红旗大队粮油加工厂突然失火了，共产党员高成林跑到火场，一次又一次地冲进火海抢救人民的集体财产。房顶上的木头、瓦片、天花板劈里啪啦地往下掉，可是，我们的高成林不是“第一是要命”的怕死鬼，他的脑子里只有人民。为了使人民利益不受损失，他一次又一次地冲进了火海，往外搬运物资。高成林用忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，谱写了一曲毛泽东思想的壮丽凯歌。这是对刘少奇的“叛徒哲学”“活命哲学”最有力的回击！
    “向高成林同志学习！”“打倒大叛徒刘少奇！”“保卫毛主席！”的战斗口号声响成一片。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中入党的朝气蓬勃的新党员张培起、王秩雄，抓住机会开了“炮”，义愤填膺地说：叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹的“第一是要命，第二是工作”，同赫鲁晓夫的所谓“脑袋掉了还要什么原则”异曲同工。刘少奇这个大叛徒竭力贩卖他的“叛徒哲学”“活命哲学”，就是要腐蚀广大党员和革命人民，使我们变成贪生怕死、背叛革命的软骨虫，以便于他篡党、篡政、篡军，复辟资本主义。我们决不能上当。我们一定要以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠狠改造世界观，永远做毛主席的好战士。
    奔腾急，万马战犹酣。30号艇的指战员，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇批深批臭。“打倒刘少奇！”“彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想！”的战斗口号声，在军港的上空激荡……。
