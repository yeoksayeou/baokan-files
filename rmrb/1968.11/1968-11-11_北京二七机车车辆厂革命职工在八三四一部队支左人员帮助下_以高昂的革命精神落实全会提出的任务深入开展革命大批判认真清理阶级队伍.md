Revolutionary workers of the Beijing Second Seven Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, with the help of the Eighth Three Four Division's leftist support team, are implementing the various great combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee with high revolutionary spirit. The tide of revolutionary criticism is currently surging across the entire factory. Under the inspiration of the plenary session's communiqué, revolutionary workers are fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's dissemination of the reactionary revisionist goods such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." They are also launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, deeply carrying out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, and presenting a new and vibrant scene of revolution and production across the entire factory.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was published, and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Second Seven Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory immediately launched a wave of studying and propagating the communiqué. With the help of the Eighth Three Four Division's leftist support team stationed in the factory, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the factory headquarters and various workshops and teams. During the discussions and sharing sessions on studying the communiqué, revolutionary workers enthusiastically praise the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao. Many old workers eagerly recall their bitter experiences to denounce the evil old society and the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism and his heinous reactionary crimes. Through studying, revolutionary workers have deepened their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and further heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Many workers say: The communiqué conveys the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao. The more we study, the closer we feel to Chairman Mao, and the more we study, the more we hate the big villain Liu Shaoqi. Workers hurriedly wrote pledge letters at night, expressing their loyalty to Chairman Mao and vowing to continue to settle accounts with the reactionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents. An old worker from the North Branch Factory has low cultural literacy and finds it difficult to write a pledge letter. Others offered to write it for him, but he said: "Chairman Mao has cleared away this big harm for us. This is a great joy for the working class. I want to personally write to Chairman Mao to express my heartfelt words and express my loyalty to Chairman Mao!" With the help of the military leftist support team, revolutionary workers organized twenty Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, quickly compiled more than sixty artistic performances reflecting the spirit of the communiqué, and went deep into workshops, offices, worker hospitals, family dormitories, and nearby people's communes to propagate. Many old workers who had never performed on stage before also took the initiative to compile performances and participate in the propaganda.

In earnestly implementing the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, the revolutionary workers of the Second Seven Factory quickly launched a new high tide of criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Second Seven Factory who promoted the reactionary revisionist line. Criticism meetings in various workshops follow one after another, and revolutionary big-character posters are posted in batches. Revolutionary workers pointed out that one of the heinous crimes of the big villain Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Second Seven Factory is the extensive dissemination of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." They surrender and recruit traitors, shelter and promote a handful of class enemies, and implement bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat. Revolutionary workers said, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi wants us to suffer again, we absolutely do not agree, we absolutely do not agree! We, the working class, must forever hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and sweep away all harmful creatures. The revolutionary criticism greatly strengthened the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle, and they carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks more solidly. In recent days, under the inspiration of the communiqué, revolutionary workers have been fighting with high spirits and have uncovered a batch of deeply hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. The Boiler and other workshops have organized investigation teams mainly composed of old workers to thoroughly investigate the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in promoting the reactionary revisionist line in the factory, so as to better carry out the work of cleaning up the class ranks and earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In implementing the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, all revolutionary workers of the factory are following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war" with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm. On the basis of overfulfilling the national production plan for October, they are striving to complete and overfulfill the annual production tasks. The production level of many workshops and teams is rising rapidly. The Forging Workshop completes its production tasks every day. A type of screw produced by this workshop was previously produced at 2,000 per shift. After the publication of the communiqué, it has been increased to 5,100 per shift, exceeding the historical highest level. The Foundry, Boiler, Forging, Material, and Tool workshops have seen a continuous increase in technical innovation projects in recent days. The Copper Casting Group of the Foundry Workshop previously attempted to produce a new type of dynamic wheel axle box, but failed after multiple trials. Under the inspiration of the communiqué, the workers, technicians, and military leftist support team of this workshop held an on-site meeting in front of the furnace, fully mobilizing everyone's wisdom and strength, and finally successfully produced this new product. The revolutionary workers of the Boiler and Locomotive workshops also voluntarily formed production investigation teams to study the issue of breaking various unreasonable regulations that shackle the workers' hands and feet. A new situation of mutual support and cooperation between workshops and teams, promoting a significant increase in production, is continuously emerging across the factory.

Currently, with the help of the Eighth Three Four Division's leftist support team, the Second Seven Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory is seeing a better and better situation of revolution and production. Revolutionary workers are determined, under the battle call of the communiqué, to earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, make the revolution fiery hot, and make production steaming hot, and welcome the victorious convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party with even better results.

    新华社十日讯　具有光荣革命传统的北京二七机车车辆工厂广大革命职工，在人民解放军八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，正以高昂的革命精神，认真落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务。革命大批判的高潮目前正在全厂掀起。广大革命职工在全会公报的鼓舞下，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇散布的“阶级斗争熄灭论”等反革命修正主义黑货，并结合革命大批判，主动向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，深入开展清理阶级队伍的工作，使全厂革命和生产呈现一片崭新气象。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，二七机车车辆工厂广大革命职工立即掀起了学习、宣传全会公报的热潮。在八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，学习全会公报的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，在厂部和各个车间、班组普遍办了起来。在学习公报的讨论会和讲用会上，革命职工大颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩。许多老工人争着忆苦思甜，以亲身经历控诉万恶的旧社会，控诉叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义的反革命滔天罪行。广大革命职工通过学习，更加加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。许多职工说：全会公报传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，我们越学对毛主席越亲，越学对大坏蛋刘少奇越恨。职工们纷纷连夜赶写决心书，向毛主席表忠心，表示要继续清算刘少奇及其代理人的反革命罪行。北分厂有一位老工人文化低，写决心书有困难，别人要代他写，他说：“毛主席为我们清除了刘少奇这一大害，这是我们工人阶级的大喜事。我要亲笔向毛主席写出我的心里话，向毛主席表忠心！”革命职工还在解放军支左人员的帮助下，组织了二十个毛泽东思想宣传队，连夜编排了六十多个反映全会公报精神的文艺节目，深入车间、科室、职工医院、家属宿舍和附近农村人民公社进行宣传，不少从来没有登台表演过的老工人，也主动连夜编排节目，参加宣传。
    二七厂革命职工在认真落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务中，迅速掀起了批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在二七厂代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线的新高潮。各车间里批判会一个接着一个，革命大批判的大字报一批又一批地张贴出来。广大革命职工指出，刘少奇这个大坏蛋及其在二七厂的代理人的滔天罪行之一，就是大肆散布“阶级斗争熄灭论”，他们招降纳叛，包庇和重用一小撮阶级敌人，对无产阶级实行资产阶级专政。革命职工们说，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇想让我们再吃二遍苦，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们工人阶级就是要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，扫除一切害人虫。革命的大批判大大增强了革命职工的阶级斗争观念，他们把清理阶级队伍的工作做得更加扎实。这几天来，广大革命职工在全会公报的鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，又奋起揭发出一批隐藏得很深的叛徒、特务和其它反革命分子。锅炉等车间还以老工人为主组成调查小组，深入调查刘少奇及其在本厂的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行，以便更好地做好清理阶级队伍工作，认真搞好斗、批、改。
    在落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务中，全厂广大革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，正以冲天的革命干劲，在超额完成十月份国家生产计划的基础上，为完成和超额完成全年生产任务而奋斗。不少车间、班组的生产水平蒸蒸日上。锻工车间生产任务天天超额完成。这个车间生产的一种螺丝，过去每班生产二千个，全会公报发表后，已经提高到每班生产五千一百个，超过了历史最高水平。铸工、锅炉、锻工、利材、工具等车间连日来技术革新项目不断增加。铸工车间铸铜组以前试制一种新型的动轮轴瓦，经过多次试验没有成功。在全会公报的鼓舞下，这个车间的工人、技术人员和解放军支左人员一起在炉前举行现场会，充分发挥大家的智慧和力量，终于试制成功了这种新产品。锅炉、机车等车间的革命工人，还自动组成了生产调查小组，研究破除束缚工人手脚的各种不合理的规章制度的问题。全厂车间与车间、班组与班组之间互相支援、互相协作，促进生产大幅度增长的新气象不断出现。
    目前，二七机车车辆工厂在人民解放军八三四一部队支左人员帮助下，革命和生产的形势越来越好。广大革命职工决心在全会公报的战斗号令下，认真搞好斗、批、改，把革命搞得热火朝天，生产搞得热气腾腾，以更优异的成绩迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的胜利召开。
