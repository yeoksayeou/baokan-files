Hong Kong and Macau patriots have been holding meetings with great excitement to celebrate the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee of the CPC, chaired by the great leader Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and firmly support the plenary session's resolution to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party and revoke all his positions inside and outside the Party.

On the 2nd and 3rd, nearly sixty units of workers, peasants, students, hawkers, journalists, film workers, staff of patriotic organizations, and businesspeople in Hong Kong held celebratory meetings. At these meetings, patriots spoke one after another. They unanimously pointed out that the successful convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee of the CPC is a historic event of great significance. They expressed their firm support for all the important decisions of the plenary session. They said: The plenary session unanimously passed a resolution to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party and revoke all his positions inside and outside the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We firmly support it. Everyone excitedly shouted: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Following Chairman Mao is victory!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions held an expanded meeting of the council on the evening of the 3rd to enthusiastically celebrate the successful convening of the plenary session and the publication of the communiqué. The chairman of the federation, Chen Yaocai, said: We, the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, have always loved the great socialist motherland, loved the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and loved the great leader Chairman Mao. We, the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, firmly support the plenary session's resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party. This resolution is a verdict, pronouncing the complete downfall of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. The evil plot of imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic and foreign reactionaries to restore capitalism in China has been completely foiled.

In his speech, the president of the federation, Yang Guang, pointed out that the communiqué of the plenary session greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people, greatly dampened the spirits of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and pointed out the victorious course for the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country to continue advancing. He said, the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon enthusiastically welcome the decision of the plenary session to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time. Yang Guang called on the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon to continue to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought spread more widely and deeply among the workers and patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, to win the final victory in the struggle against British imperialism and violence, and to contribute to the support of the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world.
