The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Xi'an Metallurgical and Architectural College, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "all work in schools is for the transformation of students' thinking," uses Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and revolutionary criticism as a driving force. They lead revolutionary teachers and students to denounce the harm caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, severely criticize the bourgeois ideas of "studying to become an official," "fame and profit," and prioritizing professional skills over politics. They help revolutionary teachers and students to completely break away from old traditional ideas, seizing the ideological leadership of the school from the bourgeois intellectuals.

All revolutionary teachers and students have expressed their anger at the poisoning of counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts such as "studying to become an official," "fame and profit," and prioritizing professional skills over politics. They have declared that they will definitely change their old thoughts and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Xi'an Metallurgical and Architectural College, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "all work in schools is for the transformation of students' thinking," uses Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and revolutionary criticism as a driving force. They lead revolutionary teachers and students to denounce the harm caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, severely criticize the bourgeois ideas of "studying to become an official," "fame and profit," and prioritizing professional skills over politics. They help revolutionary teachers and students to completely break away from old traditional ideas, seizing the ideological leadership of the school from the bourgeois intellectuals.

For over a decade, Xi'an Metallurgical and Architectural College has been controlled by counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois intellectuals. They have spread bourgeois ideas in the school, advocating for "fame, profit, and expertise," and aiming to be "someone above others." Due to the lingering influence of bourgeois ideas, after the resumption of classes and the revolution, many students were more enthusiastic about resuming professional courses than political courses. During factory internships, they focused more on mastering technology than on participating in physical labor. Some people, because their personal desires for fame and profit were not met, became disillusioned, saying things like "studying is a loss" and "going to university was a mistake in direction and line." After the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the school, they deeply felt that the influence of the revisionist educational line must be eradicated. They realized that the students were victims of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and needed to be helped to free themselves from its influence. They needed to direct all their hatred towards Liu Shaoqi. This is a struggle to seize ideological leadership from the bourgeois intellectuals.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution," led all teachers and students in the school to carry out revolutionary criticism while doing a good job of current class struggle. In the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team adopted the method of combining words with deeds. They led the teachers and students to put themselves in the picture, closely linking revolutionary criticism with the eradication of revisionist influences in their own thoughts. Leading in thought means using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the thoughts of teachers and students, turning the process of transforming their thoughts into a process of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Leading in politics means guiding everyone to care about national affairs, actively participating in revolutionary criticism and the current class struggle in the school, and overcoming the past phenomenon of "grasp, struggle, and ignore" towards counter-revolutionary revisionists. Leading in style means establishing the fine style of combining theory with practice and self-criticism, learning, using, and changing simultaneously, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, consciously transforming oneself, and drawing a clear line with the ideological consciousness of the exploiting class. In the past, some teachers and students in this college had private fears, sat on the cold bench during meetings, read "every day" but did not discuss, and dared not touch their own souls. Seeing this situation, the worker comrades took the lead in exposing their own thoughts and fiercely fought against the "self" in their minds. The workers also passed on the good experience of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the factory to the school, which had a great educational impact on all teachers and students in the college.

Under the guidance of the workers, revolutionary teachers and students, in connection with their own erroneous thoughts, angrily denounced the harm caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line to themselves. Many students recalled that when they first entered the university, the first lesson the school gave them was about fame and fortune, how to become an engineer or an architect, making them see university as a stepping stone to becoming an engineer or an architect. Some reactionary "professors" even instilled in them: you need to pass politically, be strong technically, and live well. As a result, under the education of those bourgeois intellectuals, many of us took the white expert road of "knowledge is power," with "two ears deaf to outside affairs, and one heart set on becoming an engineer." Xu Quanye, a student from a poor peasant family in the heating and ventilation major, painfully recalled his past. When he first entered the university, he wore coarse cloth clothes and hated the fancy people, thinking that after graduation, he could better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. But after a few years, he gradually developed a contempt for physical labor and the idea of going to university to become an official. He said: forgetting the poor and lower-middle peasants is forgetting one's roots, forgetting the revolution.

On the basis of carrying out revolutionary criticism, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went deep into the masses, did painstaking and detailed ideological work, and widely carried out heart-to-heart talks with teachers and students, inspiring them to consciously struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. They helped teachers and students to draw a clear line with revisionism. Some teachers and students had the passive thought of "struggle, criticize, and leave." The old workers then had heart-to-heart talks with them three times, raising their awareness of the two-line struggle, and patiently persuaded them, saying: "If you don't criticize and want to leave, carrying dirty thoughts, will the workers welcome you to the factory? Will the poor and lower-middle peasants welcome you to the countryside? We hope you are the last batch of intellectuals poisoned by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. As long as you go through struggle, criticism, and reform, and become intellectuals serving the proletariat, you will become intellectuals loved by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants." The old workers' heartfelt words touched the hearts of revolutionary teachers and students, and everyone expressed their determination to completely change their old thoughts and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

Through revolutionary criticism, Xi'an Metallurgical and Architectural College has now presented a vibrant revolutionary scene, with people changing their thoughts and the school changing its appearance. Teachers and students generally feel that since the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed here, there have been five major changes: political and ideological work is greatly different, academic style is greatly different, class feelings are greatly different, democratic atmosphere is greatly different, and the spirit of hard work and plain living is greatly different. Teachers and students' love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao have been strengthened, their initiative in studying Chairman Mao's works has been enhanced, and in the past, they were afraid to expose their "self" and afraid to struggle against their "self." Now they are eager to expose their "self" and struggle against their "self," realizing that having "self" but not exposing it is disloyal to Chairman Mao, and exposing it but not struggling against it is also disloyal to Chairman Mao.

    广大革命师生愤怒控诉了“读书做官”、“有名有利”、重专业轻政治等反革命修正主义思想的毒害。大家表示：一定要彻底改变旧思想，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来
    本报讯　驻西安冶金建筑学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“学校一切工作都是为了转变学生的思想”的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，以革命大批判为动力，带领革命师生控诉了反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，狠批“读书做官”、“有名有利”、重专业轻政治等资产阶级思想，帮助革命师生同旧的传统观念实行彻底的决裂，从思想上夺取资产阶级知识分子统治学校的领导权。
    十几年来，西安冶金建筑学院一直被反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级知识分子把持着，他们在学校里广泛散播资产阶级思想，宣扬“名、利、专”，做“人上人”。由于资产阶级思想的流毒没有彻底肃清，复课闹革命以后，有不少学生热心于复专业课，不热心复政治课；下厂实习比较地重视钻研技术，不大重视参加体力劳动。有些人因为过去追求的个人名利欲望达不到了，就“逍遥”起来，说什么“读书吃亏”、“上大学是犯了方向路线性的错误”。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校以后，深深感到修正主义教育路线的流毒不肃清不行。他们认识到，学生们是刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的受害者，要帮助他们从修正主义路线的影响下解脱出来，要把千仇万恨集中到刘少奇身上。这是在思想领域里夺取资产阶级知识分子领导权的斗争。工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵循毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”的教导，在领导全院师生做好当前清理阶级队伍工作的同时，引导大家开展了革命大批判。
    在开展革命大批判的过程中，工人毛泽东思想宣传队采取了言传身教的办法，带思想、带政治、带作风，引导师生把自己摆进去，使革命大批判同肃清自己思想上的修正主义流毒紧密结合起来。带思想，就是用毛泽东思想去改造师生的思想，把转变师生思想的过程，变成活学活用毛泽东思想的过程。带政治，就是引导大家关心国家大事，积极投入革命大批判和当前全院正在进行的清理阶级队伍的工作，克服以往那种对反革命修正主义分子“一揪二斗三不管”的现象。带作风，就是树立理论联系实际以及自我批评的优良作风，边学边用边改，以“斗私，批修”为纲，自觉地改造自己，和剥削阶级的思想意识划清界限。这个学院过去有一些师生，有私怕亮，开会坐冷板凳，“天天读”只读不议，不敢触及自己的灵魂。工人同志看到这种情况，就带头亮自己的思想，狠斗头脑中的“私”字。工人们还把工厂里学一点，用一点，学多少，用多少的活学活用毛主席著作的好经验传给学校，这对全院师生教育很大。
    在工人的启发诱导下，革命师生结合个人的错误思想，愤怒地控诉了反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害。许多学生回忆说，我们一进大学，学校里向我们上的第一堂课就是成名成家，如何当工程师、建筑师之类，使我们把上大学看成是当工程师和建筑师的跳板。甚至个别反动“教授”还向我们灌输：你们要政治上过得去，技术上过得硬，生活上过得好。结果在那些资产阶级知识分子的教育下，我们不少人走上“知识万能”的白专道路，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心想当工程师。”供热通风专业贫农家庭出身的学生许全业沉痛地回顾了自己走过的道路。他刚进大学，穿的粗布衣服，那时候他非常讨厌洋里洋气的人，心想将来毕业后能够更好地为贫下中农服务就好了。可是没过几年，逐渐产生了轻视体力劳动和上学为了升官的坏思想。他说：忘记贫下中农，就是忘了本，就是忘了革命。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在开展革命大批判的基础上，又深入群众，做艰苦细致的思想工作，广泛地和师生开展谈心活动，启发师生自觉地斗私批修。帮助师生同修正主义划清界限。有的师生存在“斗批走”的消极思想。老工人们便三番五次地找他们谈心，提高他们的两条路线斗争觉悟，并循循善诱地对他们说：“你们不批就想走，带着肮脏思想，走到工厂，工人会欢迎你们吗？走到农村，贫下中农会欢迎你们吗？我们希望你们是最后一批被叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇毒害的知识分子。只要你们经过斗批改，变成了为无产阶级服务的知识分子，你们会成为工人、贫下中农喜欢的知识分子。”老工人们语重心长的话，打动了革命师生的心，大家表示一定要彻底改变旧思想，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来。
    经过革命大批判，西安冶金建筑学院目前已出现一派朝气蓬勃的革命景象，人换思想校改貌。师生们普遍反映说，工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻后出现了五个大不一样：政治思想工作大不一样，学风大不一样，阶级感情大不一样，民主空气大不一样，三八作风大不一样。师生们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情增强了，学习毛主席著作的自觉性提高了，过去是亮“私”怕丑，斗“私”怕痛，现在则争先恐后地亮私，斗私，认识到有私不亮就是对毛主席不忠，亮了不斗也是对毛主席不忠。
