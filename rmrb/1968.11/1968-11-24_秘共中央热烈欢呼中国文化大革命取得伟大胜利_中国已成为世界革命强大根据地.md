The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru recently issued a statement warmly congratulating the great victory achieved by the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The statement pointed out that on the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, except for Taiwan Province. This is a great victory for contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. China has become a strong bastion of socialism and a powerful base for world revolution. The great significance of this event transcends the borders of China. Revolutionary people all over the world are exhilarated by the victory achieved by the heroic Chinese people under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, while the reactionaries led by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are trembling with fear.

The statement pointed out that in China, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have taken the leading position, and socialist economy has achieved brilliant development in all aspects. The new proletarian culture has triumphed, and the heroic Chinese armed forces armed with Mao Zedong Thought have been strengthened. All this refutes the slander and lies spread by U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries against the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and shatters their dream of restoring capitalism in China. Revolutionaries all over the world have seen the great heroic deeds accomplished by the revolutionary Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the heroic Chinese armed forces under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The statement said that one year ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat throughout the country is excellent, not just good." The statement went on to say that the facts of the victory achieved by this great revolution have confirmed this prophecy. In China, the victory of establishing revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination has developed and consolidated the leadership of the working class, fully guaranteed proletarian dictatorship, and ensured the thorough victory of socialism on the reliable road to a communist society.

The statement said that the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat not only provides valuable experience for the Chinese revolution but also has a powerful impact on the development of revolutions worldwide.

The statement warmly congratulates the whole of China turning red and firmly believes that Taiwan Province will also be liberated from the claws of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru in the statement called out:

Long live the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

    中国已成为世界革命强大根据地
    新华社二十三日讯　利马消息：秘鲁共产党中央委员会政治委员会最近发表声明，热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    声明指出，在中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，中国全国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会，这是当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。中国已经成为社会主义的坚强堡垒，世界革命的强大根据地。这个事件的伟大意义越过了中国国界。全世界革命人民对英雄的中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉指引下所取得的这一胜利，感到欢欣鼓舞，而以美帝国主义和苏联修正主义为首的反动派却胆战心惊。
    声明指出，在中国，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想取得了领导地位，社会主义经济在各方面都取得了光辉发展，无产阶级新文化取得了胜利，用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国武装部队得到了加强。这一切驳斥了美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行的造谣诬蔑，粉碎了它们在中国复辟资本主义的梦想。全世界的革命者看到了革命的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党、英雄的中国武装部队在毛泽东思想指引下作出的伟大英雄业绩。
    声明说，一年前，毛泽东同志指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。”声明接着说，这场大革命所取得的胜利的事实证实了这个预言。在中国，建立三结合的革命委员会的胜利，发展和巩固了工人阶级的领导，使无产阶级专政得到了充分的保证，同时确保社会主义沿着通向共产主义社会的可靠道路取得彻底胜利。
    声明说，无产阶级文化大革命取得的胜利，不仅对中国革命，而且对所有的革命都提供了宝贵的经验，对全世界范围的革命的发展产生了强大的影响。
    声明热烈欢呼中国全国一片红，并且表示坚信，台湾省也必将从美帝国主义及其走狗的魔爪下得到解放。
    秘鲁共产党中央委员会政治委员会在声明中高呼：
    中国无产阶级文化革命胜利万岁！
