In March of this year, under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Commune in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, took direct control of rural schools, ushering in a new stage in the rural educational revolution. Through their personal revolutionary practice, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt that the fundamental task of peasants managing schools is to firmly grasp the struggle between the two educational lines and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought.

New-Type Schools and Revolutionary Teachers and Students

After the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Commune took control of school management, in just seven or eight months, they changed the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, making the schools and teachers and students take on a new look.

1. The school doors are wide open to the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and the schools are run in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. After the peasants took control of the schools, they implemented the policy of "the commune runs the junior high school, and the production brigade runs the primary school." The entire commune established one two-year junior high school, one seven-year primary school with an attached junior high school class, and thirteen five-year primary schools, ensuring that the children of poor and lower-middle peasants could attend school nearby. At the same time, they relaxed the age restrictions for enrollment, abolished the old grading system, entrance examination system, promotion and retention system, suspension and withdrawal system, and reward and punishment system, thoroughly smashing the numerous barriers that hindered the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. By now, the enrollment rate of primary school-age children has surged to over 93%, and the junior high school has enrolled 431 students, exceeding the total number of students who have attended junior high school since liberation.

2. The children of poor and lower-middle peasants are growing up healthily and will surely be nurtured into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the schools run by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves, students "not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie." The schools set up courses on Chairman Mao's works, Mao Zedong Thought propaganda, class struggle, production labor, military sports, and cultural knowledge. All schools are actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

3. A team of teachers, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the mainstay, has taken control of the rural educational front. Twenty-seven public school teachers came out of their "small world" and moved to brigade-run primary schools and commune-run junior high schools, working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and receiving re-education from them. Each production brigade selected 29 middle and primary school teachers from poor and lower-middle peasants with rich practical experience, from knowledge youth who had been tempered through the three great revolutionary movements for many years, and from original teachers of private primary schools; at the same time, they hired 170 "barefoot teachers," including old poor peasants who had suffered deeply in the old society, demobilized soldiers, militia platoon leaders, production team accountants, "local experts" from agricultural science institutes, "barefoot doctors," and rural knowledge youth, to give lectures in middle and primary schools on a regular basis, thoroughly changing the situation where bourgeois intellectuals ruled the schools and establishing the absolute dominance of poor and lower-middle peasants in the teaching staff.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongqi Commune unanimously praised the changes in the schools, saying: "No matter how many changes there are, the biggest change is to occupy the school battlefield with Mao Zedong Thought! We poor and lower-middle peasants directly managing the schools is a great victory for Chairman Mao's educational revolution line."

The Life-and-Death Struggle Between the Two Educational Lines

Hongqi Commune implemented the direct management of schools by poor and lower-middle peasants, experiencing a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two educational lines. "Once the landlord power in the countryside is overthrown, the peasants' cultural movement begins." After the land reform and the people's commune movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Commune had launched two waves of mass-run schools, establishing one agricultural middle school and four primary schools. How good this was! However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents labeled them with various "crimes" and forcibly shut them down. Batch after batch of children of poor and lower-middle peasants were forced to drop out of school.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongqi Commune, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and using Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought as a sharp weapon, launched a great exposure, denunciation, and criticism of the educational system of the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist classes. The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out sharply: Over the past decade or so since liberation, rural schools have basically been controlled by bourgeois intellectuals. Some have become "air-raid shelters" for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, "junk stalls" for gathering social dregs, and "black warehouses" for spreading feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist black goods.

Schools controlled by bourgeois intellectuals opened the door wide for landlords and rich peasants, but made every effort to hinder the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. Just because of the enrollment barrier, many children of poor and lower-middle peasants were excluded from the school gates. According to statistics from October 1964, the commune had 40% of primary school-age children who had not enrolled in school. Even if they barely passed the enrollment barrier, they could be kicked out of school at any time. One year, the capitalist roaders in the educational field concocted a scheme called "handling the three poor and one large," using "poor in studies, poor in health, poor in morality, and old in age" as excuses to kick out over 80 children of poor and lower-middle peasants from this commune's school gates.

"The school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not continue." Through struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply realized: To thoroughly liberate themselves, they must thoroughly smash Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line; first, they must resolutely seize the educational power from the hands of bourgeois intellectuals.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Directly Managed the Schools

The process of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongqi Commune and eight production brigades seizing educational power was a process of following the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and truly running schools directly by poor and lower-middle peasants. This was a profound great revolution.

When the news that the poor and lower-middle peasants decided to run the commune junior high school and production brigade primary school spread, a small group of class enemies came out to spread rumors and stir up trouble, saying, "Can a few rough peasants really run the schools well?" Some people with serious old ideas also asked the commune and brigade cadres, "Running the commune junior high school and production brigade primary school is good, but I wonder if we have the conditions here?" Facing this situation, the eight production brigades and the commune held Mao Zedong Thought study classes composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students, resolutely exposing and severely striking down the class enemies who sabotaged the proletarian educational revolution, deeply launching a great criticism of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line; at the same time, they held a great debate around the questions "What conditions are needed for commune-run and brigade-run schools? Do we have the conditions for commune-run junior high schools and brigade-run primary schools?" Through the debate, everyone deeply realized: The "conditions" for running schools are class-based. Different classes running schools will choose different teachers, different students, and different classrooms. They said, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the best teachers for our schools, all the children of poor and lower-middle peasants are the best students for our schools, and the vast socialist countryside is the best classroom for our schools. The conditions for proletarians to run schools, we have them all. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, making do with what they had and overcoming numerous difficulties, quickly repairing school buildings and facilities, and not asking the state for a single cent. In just ten days, a batch of new-type middle and primary schools established by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves opened successfully.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Forever Hold the Educational Power

The schools were established, but the class struggle did not end.

In the first two months after the schools opened, the revolutionary teachers and students were full of energy, and the educational revolution in the schools was booming. Soon, a small group of class enemies jumped out again to engage in sabotage. The newly established schools faced a new test of class struggle.

It was at this critical moment that our great leader Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," providing the poor and lower-middle peasants with the sharpest ideological weapon. The Revolutionary Committee of Hongqi Commune led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a new and larger-scale learning campaign, promptly implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Commune mainly focused on three major tasks:

1. Arm the broad masses with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought and launch a proletarian educational revolution mass movement. The commune and production brigades frequently held Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on implementing Chairman Mao's educational revolution thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants' school management groups in the production brigades and the commune poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee regularly or irregularly held mass meetings, representative meetings, or symposiums for poor and lower-middle peasants, student parents, and revolutionary teachers and students, reporting to them the situation of the struggle between the two educational lines in the schools and listening to their opinions on the educational revolution in the schools.

2. Arm the revolutionary teachers and students with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought and firmly run "May 7th-type" and "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-type" schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Commune, taking Chairman Mao's "May 7th" brilliant directive as the fundamental guideline for the educational revolution, using various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the main battlefield, launched a revolutionary great criticism, organized revolutionary teachers and students to study one of Chairman Mao's relevant directives, criticize one of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist fallacies, and establish one new system. The schools in this commune have already placed the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, making class struggle the main course. They vigorously carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

3. Arm the leading cadres with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought and build the poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee and school management groups into the command departments for the rural educational revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praised the poor and lower-middle peasants' school management committee and school management groups, saying: "Such a cadre team, united on Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, fighting on the battlefield of rural education, striving for the brilliant road of Chairman Mao's educational thought, each one is a leader in managing schools by poor and lower-middle peasants."

    狠抓两条教育路线的斗争不转向
    ——湖北谷城县红旗公社贫下中农管理学校的经验（调查报告）
    今年三月，在毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想的光辉照耀下，湖北省谷城县红旗公社贫下中农直接管理了农村学校，把农村教育革命推向了一个崭新的阶段。广大贫下中农从亲身经历的革命实践中，深深体会到：贫下中农管理学校的根本任务，就是要狠抓两条教育路线的斗争不转向，彻底实现毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想。
    新型的学校　革命的师生
    红旗公社贫下中农掌握管理学校大权后，短短七八个月的时间，便改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，使学校和师生的面貌焕然一新。
    一、学校大门朝贫下中农子女敞开，学校办在贫下中农的心坎上。贫下中农直接办学后，全面实行“公社办中学，大队办完小”，全公社办起了一所二年制初中、一所附设初中班的七年制小学和十三所五年制小学，保证了贫下中农子女就近上学。同时，放宽了入学年龄限制，废除了旧的分数制度、入学考试制度、升留级制度、休学退学制度和奖惩制度，彻底砸烂了刁难贫下中农子女入学的重重关卡。至目前止，小学适龄儿童的入学率猛增到百分之九十三以上，中学招收了四百三十一人，超过了解放以来上中学学生人数的总和。
    二、贫下中农子女正在茁壮成长，必将培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。在贫下中农自己办的学校里，学生“不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”。学校设立了毛主席著作课、毛泽东思想宣传课、阶级斗争课、生产劳动课、军事体育课和文化知识课。所有学校活学活用毛泽东思想蔚然成风。
    三、一支以贫下中农为主体的教师队伍占领了农村教育阵地。二十七名公办学校教师走出了“小天地”，搬到了队办小学和社办中学，同贫下中农滚在一起，接受贫下中农的再教育。各生产大队又从有丰富实践经验的贫下中农社员和经过多年三大革命运动锻炼的知识青年以及原民办小学教师中选拔了二十九名中、小学教师；同时还聘请在旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农以及复员军人、民兵连长、生产队会计、农科所的“土专家”、“赤脚医生”和农村知识青年等一百七十名“赤脚教师”，定期到中小学讲课，彻底改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的状况，在教师队伍中树立了贫下中农的绝对优势。
    红旗公社广大贫下中农对学校发生的这些变化，一致赞颂。他们说：“千变化，万变化，用毛泽东思想占领学校阵地，是最大的变化！我们贫下中农直接管理学校，是毛主席教育革命路线的伟大胜利。”
    两条教育路线的生死大搏斗
    红旗公社实行贫下中农直接管理学校，经历了一场两个阶级、两条教育路线的生死大搏斗。“农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。”红旗公社贫下中农在土地改革运动和人民公社化运动后，曾经掀起了两次群众办学热潮，先后办起了一所耕读农业中学和四所初级小学。这是何等好啊！但是，大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人，却给它们安上了种种“罪名”，硬把它们先后砍掉了。一批批贫下中农子女被迫失学。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，红旗公社广大贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想为锐利武器，对封、资、修的教育制度展开了大揭发、大控诉、大批判。贫下中农一针见血地指出：解放十几年来，农村学校基本上被资产阶级知识分子统治着，有的成了地、富、反、坏、右分子的“防空洞”，成了网罗社会残渣的“杂货摊”，成了散发封、资、修黑货的“黑仓库”。
    资产阶级知识分子统治的学校，为地主、富农大开方便之门，而对贫下中农子女入学则百般刁难。就因为入学这一关，很多贫下中农子女被排斥在校门之外。据一九六四年十月份统计，全公社仅小学未入学的适龄儿童，即达百分之四十。就是勉强闯过了入学关，也随时有可能被赶出学校。有一年，盘踞在教育界的走资派搞了一个处理“三差、一大”的花样，以“学习差、身体差、品德差、年龄大”为借口，把这个公社八十多名贫下中农子女一脚踢出了学校大门。
    “学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”贫下中农通过斗争实践，深刻认识到：要彻底翻身解放，必须彻底摧毁刘少奇的修正主义教育路线；首先必须坚决从资产阶级知识分子手里夺回教育大权。
    贫下中农直接管理了学校
    红旗公社和八个生产大队贫下中农夺回教育大权的过程，就是遵循伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，真正实行贫下中农直接办学校的过程。这是一场深刻的大革命。
    贫下中农决定要办公社中学和生产大队小学的消息一传开，一小撮阶级敌人就出来煽阴风，点鬼火，说什么“光靠几个大老粗，能把学校办好吗？”一些旧思想意识比较严重的人也找社、队干部问道：“公社办中学、大队办完小好是好，不知我们这里条件怎么样？”针对这种情况，八个生产大队和公社举办了由贫下中农、革命干部、革命师生组成的三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，坚决揭露、狠狠打击那些破坏无产阶级教育革命的阶级敌人，深入开展对大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判；同时，围绕“社办、队办学校需要什么条件？社办中学、队办小学，我们到底有没有条件？”展开了一场大辩论。通过辩论，大家深刻认识到：办学校“条件”是有阶级性的，不同的阶级办学，会选择不同的教师、不同的学生、不同的课堂。他们说，广大贫下中农，是我们学校的最好老师，所有的贫下中农子女，是我们学校的最好学生，广阔的社会主义农村，是我们学校的最好课堂。无产阶级办学校的条件，我们样样具备。广大贫下中农发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的“抗大”革命精神，因陋就简，克服重重困难，赶修校舍、校具，没有伸手向国家要一分钱。在短短的十天时间内，一批由贫下中农亲手创办的新型中、小学校，胜利开学了。
    贫下中农必须永远掌好教育大权
    学校办起来了，但是阶级斗争并没有结束。
    学校开办的头两个月，革命师生劲头很足，学校教育革命搞得热火朝天。不久，一小撮阶级敌人又跳出来搞阴谋破坏活动。新办起来的学校，面临新的阶级斗争的考验。
    正是在这个关键时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的光辉指示，给贫下中农送来了最锐利的思想武器。红旗公社革命委员会带领广大贫下中农，掀起了新的、更大规模的学习热潮，闻风而动地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    红旗公社的贫下中农主要抓了三件大事：
    一、用毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想武装广大群众，开展一场无产阶级教育革命的群众运动。公社、生产大队经常举办以落实毛主席教育革命思想为内容的毛泽东思想学习班。生产大队贫下中农管理学校小组和公社贫下中农管理学校委员会，定期或不定期地召开贫下中农、学生家长、革命师生的群众大会、代表会或座谈会，向他们汇报学校两条教育路线斗争的情况，听取他们对学校教育革命的意见。
    二、用毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想武装革命师生，坚定不移地办好“五·七”型、“抗大”式学校。红旗公社的贫下中农，以毛主席的“五·七”光辉指示为教育革命的根本纲领，以各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班为主要阵地，开展革命大批判，组织革命师生学习毛主席的一条有关指示，批判党内头号走资派刘少奇的一个修正主义谬论，建立一项新的制度。这个公社的学校，已经把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，把阶级斗争作为主课。大力开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的
  “三忠于”活动。
    三、用毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想武装领导班子，把贫下中农管理学校委员会和管理学校小组建设成为农村教育革命的战斗指挥部。广大贫下中农称赞贫下中农管理学校委员会和管理学校小组说：“这样的班子，团结在毛主席的无产阶级教育路线上，战斗在农村教育的阵地上，奔的是实现毛主席教育思想的光辉大道，个个是咱贫下中农管理学校的带头人。”
