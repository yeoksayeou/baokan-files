West Berlin youth rally against U.S. aggression in Vietnam

BERLIN, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) — Three thousand West Berlin youth and residents held a demonstration and rally on November 9 to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

The demonstrators carried numerous red flags and placards, with many holding up portraits of Lenin and Chairman Mao. Some of the placards read: "U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the main enemies of the people of all countries!"

"U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" The demonstration started from the city center and proceeded towards the so-called "Allied Control Council" building.

A mass meeting was held in front of the "Allied" building. Despite the threats from a large number of police sent by the reactionary authorities, the demonstrators angrily shouted slogans opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam. They pointed out that the U.S. is the same as the German fascists of yesteryears. The demonstrators also shouted slogans condemning Soviet revisionist social imperialism and "Kissinger is a Nazi!" Leaflets were distributed at the meeting, calling on people to wage an uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialism and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from Vietnam.

The Australian Stevedoring Company's management had previously collaborated with the reactionary unions to formulate the so-called "Permanentization of Dock Workers' Positions Plan." This plan has worsened the working conditions of Australian dock workers, reduced their wages, and made their lives more miserable.
