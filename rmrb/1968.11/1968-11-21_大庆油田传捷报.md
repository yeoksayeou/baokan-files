On November 11, the drilling towers of Daqing Oilfield stood tall with red flags fluttering. The workers of Drilling Team 1205 marched proudly to the new drilling site. They saw this drilling of a new well as an action to implement the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. Before starting the drilling, they held a meeting to denounce the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. The workers pointed to an adjacent slanted well and angrily said, "This slanted well is the evidence of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line."

In 1961, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, under the pretext of an inspection, came to Daqing. He spewed venom everywhere, saying, "Drilling a well is essentially about managing three things: people, machinery, and rock." In 1965, Liu Shaoqi's agent in Daqing Oilfield ordered the drilling of a "Three-One" well (a well to be drilled in one day with one drill bit). Before drilling, they prepared according to Liu Shaoqi's instructions to manage the three things: people, machinery, and rock. They sent dozens of "experts" and equipped the site with the latest dual-set equipment. During the drilling, the "experts" stood around, gesturing and commanding every move of the workers. As a result, the "Three-One" well was not drilled successfully; instead, it was drilled at an angle.

Driller Xu Wanming, who participated in the drilling of the "Three-One" well, resisted the actions of the capitalist-roaders who did not emphasize proletarian politics and was stripped of his position as a driller. Pointing to the slanted well, he said indignantly, "This well was twisted by Liu Shaoqi's black wind." Xu Wanming's accusation aroused the workers' deep hatred for the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi. Everyone expressed their determination to exert greater efforts and drill this new well quickly and well. At that time, the north wind howled, and the ground was frozen. The workers said, "We think of Chairman Mao, and though our bodies are frozen, our hearts are warm." They braved the north wind and severe cold, drilling without stop. However, soon after the second shift started drilling, the drill bit got stuck. If not handled properly, it would damage the equipment and even ruin the well. In the past, when encountering a "stuck drill" incident, it was mandatory to stop work and call in "experts" to handle it. This time, the workers, with their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the number one capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, pooled their collective wisdom and quickly resolved the issue, successfully drilling through the interlayer. They fought continuously for 27 hours and 40 minutes, using one drill bit to drill a high-quality well, setting a new record for the fastest drilling in the history of China's petroleum drilling.

    大庆油田传捷报
    十一月十一日，大庆油田高高的钻井塔上，红旗飘扬。一二○五钻井队的工人们，昂首阔步来到新的钻井区。他们把这次钻探新井的战斗，当做落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的行动。开钻前，大家举行了声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的大会。工人们指着旁边的一口斜井，愤怒地说：“这口斜井，就是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线的罪证。”
    一九六一年，大叛徒刘少奇以“视察”为名钻到大庆，满口黑话，到处放毒，胡说：“打井无非是搞好三件事，即人、机器、石头三者的关系。”一九六五年，刘少奇在大庆油田的代理人，要打一口“三一”井（即用一天时间，一个钻头，打好一口井）。钻井前，他们按照刘少奇所说的搞好人、机器、石头三件事，作好了准备。他们派来了几十个“专家”，配备了双套最新的设备。钻井时，“专家”们站在那里指手画脚，工人的每一个动作都得听他们的指挥，结果“三一”井没打成，反把井打斜了。
    参加过打“三一”井的司钻许万明，当时出来抵制走资派不突出无产阶级政治的作法，结果被他们剥夺了司钻的职务。他指着这口斜井气愤地说：“这口井，就是让刘少奇的黑风吹斜了的。”许万明的控诉，激起了工人们对党内头号走资派刘少奇的无比仇恨。大家纷纷表示，一定要发挥更大干劲，把这口新井钻得又快又好。当时，北风呼啸，天寒地冻，地面作业十分困难。工人们说，我们想着毛主席，身上结冰心里热。他们顶着北风，冒着严寒，不停地钻探。可是当第二班开钻不久，突然发生钻头被卡事故，如果处理不好，就要损坏设备，甚至把井钻坏。过去遇到“卡钻”事故，按规定必须停工，请“专家”来处理。这次，工人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对党内头号走资派刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，发挥集体智慧，很快排除了故障，胜利地钻透了夹层。他们连续奋战二十七小时四十分钟，用一个钻头打出一口优质井，刷新了我国石油钻井史上快速钻井的最高纪录。
