The Eighth Company of a certain regiment in the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, an advanced collective in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the "three supports, two military" work, they have vigorously promoted the Four Good Company movement, leading with strong political thought to drive the other three goods of the Three-Eight Style, military training, and living management, thus comprehensively strengthening the company's construction.

To do the "three supports, two military" work well, we must first grasp strong political thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work."

The Party branch of the Eighth Company, in conjunction with their practice of carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks in the Yanlong area of Leshan County, studied Chairman Mao's teachings and deeply felt that to carry out the struggle between the two lines in society, one must carry out the struggle between the two lines in one's own mind; to do the "three supports, two military" work well, one must strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the company and continuously raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the cadres and soldiers. If political thought is not grasped well and political awareness is not high, there will be loopholes everywhere, and it will be impossible to do the "three supports, two military" work well.

At the beginning, they were not so clear about this issue. However, a large number of facts educated them. One evening, Platoon Leader Yang Shangwen and the soldiers went to a production brigade for the first time to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They saw many commune members busy weaving mats. Yang Shangwen learned from talking with the masses that this household sideline had a large income, and the thought of "private" flashed in his mind: "Our hometown also has a lot of bamboo. When we demobilize, we can also do this kind of household sideline." Once the thought of "private" entered his mind, his eyes saw nothing unusual. This place was a stronghold of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's agent Li Jianquan and his accomplices in the Southwest region. Many commune members were influenced by the "three selfs and one contract," only caring about household sidelines and not caring about collective production. Yang Shangwen, because he had the thought of "doing this kind of household sideline when demobilizing," could not help correct the tendency of some commune members not caring about collective production. Political Instructor Yu Jintang discovered this problem and immediately organized the second platoon to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "if socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." This made everyone deeply realize that our fundamental task in supporting agriculture is to educate the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and to occupy the countryside with proletarian politics. To complete this task, we must thoroughly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely struggle against the "private" thought in our minds, and have a revolution in the depths of our souls to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Yang Shangwen voluntarily struggled against his selfish thoughts in front of all the soldiers and commune members, deeply touched his soul, and decided to be a steadfast soldier loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Under Yang Shangwen's influence, the brigade leader used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply examine his mistakes and mobilized the broad masses of commune members to vigorously study Chairman Mao's works and fiercely criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "three selfs and one contract" black goods. The commune members raised their political awareness and unanimously agreed to hand over the mat-making sideline to the collective management of the brigade.

Since then, the Eighth Company has vigorously grasped strong political thought in the "three supports, two military" work. The Party branch, when arranging work, first requires everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions to promote their own ideological revolutionization; when summarizing work, it focuses on summarizing the experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Comrades scattered at the support points all consciously put studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, insisting on using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine their own thoughts and actions, daring to "put themselves in" and "expose their thoughts," and fiercely struggling against the "private" thought. Because the Eighth Company has vigorously grasped strong political thought, in the past year, thirty military, division, and regiment-level activists in studying Chairman Mao's works and Four Good Platoons and Five Good Soldiers have emerged, more than in any previous year. The company's revolutionary achievements have become greater and greater, and the "three supports, two military" work has been done better and better.

Promote the Three-Eight Style, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The Party branch of the Eighth Company believes that in the new situation of the Cultural Revolution, promoting the Three-Eight Style is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Over the past year, the cadres and soldiers of the Eighth Company, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they have unified their understanding, steps, and actions. They have carried out Chairman Mao's every latest instruction and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters with the greatest determination and the fastest speed. On April 10th of this year, the radio broadcasted Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." At that time, everyone was having dinner and immediately put down their bowls to record the broadcast word by word. After dinner, everyone could recite and explain it and went to the masses to propagate it that night. On June 2nd, the editorial in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, "Seven Million Four Hundred Thousand Sichuan People Are Advancing," conveyed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The cadres and soldiers heard the broadcast and immediately rushed to various places to propagate. At that time, it happened to be raining heavily, and the river was swelling. However, the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, but the soldiers' determination to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions was greater. The river was wide and the water was deep, but the soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao was deeper. Everyone faced the storm, climbed over the steep cliffs, and crossed the Emei River to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform," Platoon Leader Lang Ziyu immediately led two new soldiers to the most backward production brigade in the entire commune and deeply mobilized the masses to "stir up the hornet's nest." Lang Ziyu, based on the clues provided by the poor and lower-middle peasants, climbed Mount Emei three times, won over the deceived masses, exposed a counter-revolutionary who had been hidden for more than twenty years, seized back the leadership of the production brigade, and pushed the struggle, criticism, and reform to a new high. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants could not help but say, "The PLA comrades are the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the closest to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must learn from the PLA and closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely and swiftly carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions."

Deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poison of the bourgeois military line, implement the principle of "few but excellent," and do a good job in military training.

In the new situation of the Cultural Revolution, how to grasp military training well? The Party branch of the Eighth Company believes that in the new situation, military training is good, and it is to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poison of the bourgeois military line, implement Comrade Lin Biao's principle of "few but excellent" training, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion to carry out military training.

At the beginning, some comrades equated politics and military affairs, advocating that if you want to train, you must "set up stalls, open up frames, and make it look like something"; some comrades also confused military training with pure military views, believing that carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks and grasping military training is a pure military view. The Party branch, in response to these active thoughts, mobilized everyone to use Chairman Mao's teachings on "politics is the commander, the soul" as a weapon to carry out a deep criticism of the bourgeois military line. Through the revolutionary criticism, comrades realized that politics and military affairs, politics is always first, politics is always the commander, politics is always the head. We must carry out military training under the guidance of the principle of political command. Putting military training in a position to overwhelm politics or on an equal footing with politics is wrong. However, it is also wrong to generally believe that grasping military training is a pure military view. Comrade Lin Biao has long instructed: "We emphasize political command, but do not think that political command means no military affairs, that is not possible. Things are always composed of several aspects, and if one is missing, it will not work." Whether there is a pure military view does not depend on whether military training is carried out, but on whether one truly understands the political significance of military training and whether one trains soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion. Now the company is carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks. While fighting against the enemy who does not carry guns, it trains the hard skills to fight against the enemy who carries guns. This is the need of class struggle, the need to strengthen the company's construction, and the need to defend Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution.

After the revolutionary criticism, comrades raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and brought military training up as well. In the busy "three supports, two military" work, they followed the requirements of the Four Goods, implemented the principle of "few but excellent" training, and took military training as an important aspect to grasp. They lived scattered in the homes of commune members. Whenever it was time for "daily training," some trained throwing grenades on the riverbank, and some trained aiming in the fields. Everyone on the training ground carried the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, and at any time, they would study a section of Chairman Mao's important teachings on political construction of the military, fiercely criticize the reactionary revisionist Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan's pure military views. Comrades said: "The red sun shines on the training ground, and the heart is trained red and the eyes are bright."

Use Mao Zedong Thought to lead the troops and manage living conditions well.

The Eighth Company has felt in the struggle practice that in the new situation, to manage living conditions well, the most important thing is for the cadres to learn to lead the troops with Mao Zedong Thought and use strong political thought to drive good living management.

The cadres of the Eighth Company, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "being both an official and a common person," closely connected with the masses, studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, held lectures and discussions, recalled bitterness and sweetness, struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and established deep proletarian feelings between the cadres and the soldiers. They were both strict in their demands and patient in their persuasion. For a period of time, the army showed signs of lax discipline, and the Party branch immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "discipline is the guarantee of the line's implementation," "strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible," etc., using democratic, discussion, and reasoning methods to make everyone realize that in the new situation of class struggle, continuously strengthening organizational discipline is the need to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and an important guarantee to strengthen the company's revolutionary construction, thus guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts to the track of proletarian revolution.

The Party branch of the Eighth Company cared for the masses' lives and insisted on the style of thrift and simplicity. After the company was engaged in the "three supports, two military" work, everyone focused on supporting the left, and for a while, they neglected the management of meals. Commander Cheng Mengyong went to the kitchen and found that some comrades thought that cooking was not as glorious as supporting the left and were not willing to do the kitchen work. He organized them to study the "Three Articles" and guided everyone to use Zhang Zedong's spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and White's spirit of "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people" to examine themselves, making everyone raise their awareness and strengthen their determination to overcome difficulties. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "self-reliance" and "clothing and food in abundance" and insisted on raising pigs and planting vegetables far away from the camp, achieving basic self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables. They also responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "further economize and make revolution" and changed the stove more than thirty times, exploring an advanced coal-burning method, reducing the coal consumption from 2.5 jin per person per day to about 3 liang, saving a large amount of coal for the state.

　　以政治思想好为统帅带动其他三好
　　——人民解放军成都部队某团八连在“三支”“两军”中创造四好连队的经验
    人民解放军成都部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、某团八连，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“三支”“两军”工作中狠抓四好连队运动，以政治思想好为统帅，带动三八作风、军事训练和生活管理，全面加强了连队建设。
    要做好“三支”“两军”工作首先要抓政治思想好
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”
    八连党支部联系在乐山县严龙地区执行“三支”“两军”任务的实践，学习毛主席的这一教导，深深体会到：要搞好社会上的两条路线斗争，必须搞好自己头脑里的两条路线斗争；要做好“三支”“两军”工作，必须加强连队思想革命化建设，不断提高干部战士的两条路线斗争觉悟。如果政治思想抓不好，政治觉悟不高，那就会漏洞百出，堵不胜堵，就不可能搞好“三支”“两军”工作。
    开始，他们对这个问题并不是那么明确的。可是，大量的事实教育了他们。一天晚上，二班长杨尚文和战士们第一次到一个生产队宣传毛主席的最新指示，看到许多社员正在忙着编席子。杨尚文在同群众谈话中了解到，这项家庭副业收入很大，脑子里出现了
  “私”字一闪念：“我们家乡竹子也很多，将来复员也搞搞这类家庭副业。”头脑里有了“私”字，眼睛就见怪不怪。这里是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在西南地区的代理人李井泉及其同伙的黑据点，许多社员受到“三自一包”的影响，只顾搞家庭副业，不关心集体生产。杨尚文因为脑子里浮现了“将来复员也搞这类家庭副业”的念头，所以对有些社员不关心集体生产的倾向，就不能帮助纠正。指导员于金堂发现了这个问题以后，立即组织二班学习毛主席关于“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领”的教导，使大家深刻认识到，我们支农的根本任务，就是用毛泽东思想教育群众，就是用无产阶级政治占领农村阵地。要完成这项任务，必须很好地活学活用毛泽东思想，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，才能坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。杨尚文主动在全连同志和社员面前狠斗私心，猛触灵魂，下定决心做一个无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。在杨尚文的带动下，生产队长以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻检查了自己的错误，并且发动广大社员大力学习毛主席著作，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“三自一包”的黑货。社员们提高了政治觉悟，一致同意把编席副业归生产队集体经营。
      从这以后，八连在“三支”“两军”中，狠抓政治思想好。党支部在布置工作时，首先要求大家学好用好毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，促进自己的思想革命化；总结工作时，着重总结活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，提高两条路线斗争觉悟的体会。分散在支左点上的同志，都自觉地把活学活用毛泽东思想放在第一位，坚持用毛主席的教导来对照检查自己的思想和行动，勇于把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，狠斗“私”字。八连由于狠抓了政治思想好，一年来，涌现出三十名军、师、团学习毛主席著作积极分子，四好班排、五好战士比以往任何一年都多。连队革命化的成绩越来越大，“三支”“两军”工作就越做越好了。
    大兴三八作风，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示
    八连党支部认为，在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下大兴三八作风，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    一年来，八连干部战士怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。他们以最大的决心和最快的速度宣传和落实毛主席的每一条最新指示和无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令。今年四月十日，电台广播了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”当时大家正在吃晚饭，马上撂下饭碗，对照广播逐字逐句地记下来。饭后，每个人都能背诵、讲解，并且连夜到群众中去宣传。六月二日，《人民日报》《解放军报》发表的《七千万四川人民在前进》的社论中传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”干部战士听到广播，立即奔赴各地去宣传。当时正赶上下大雨，河水猛涨。但是，风大雨大，哪有战士们宣传毛主席最新指示的决心大，河宽水深，哪有战士们忠于毛主席的感情深。大家迎着暴风雨，攀越断崖小道，横渡峨眉河，把毛主席的最新指示送到群众中去。毛主席发出了“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召以后，班长郎字宇立即带领两个新战士来到全公社最落后的一个生产队，深入发动群众捅“马蜂窝”。郎字宇根据贫下中农提供的线索，三次攀登峨眉山，争取受蒙蔽的群众，揭露一个隐藏二十多年的反革命分子，夺回了生产队的领导大权，把斗、批、改推向新高潮。广大贫下中农无不感动地说：“解放军同志对伟大领袖毛主席最忠最忠，跟伟大领袖毛主席最紧最紧。我们一定向解放军学习，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，雷厉风行地坚决落实毛主席的最新指示。”
    深入开展革命大批判，肃清资产阶级军事路线的流毒，贯彻“少而精”的原则，搞好军事训练
    在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，如何抓好军事训练？八连党支部认为，在新形势下，军事训练好，就是要深入开展革命大批判，肃清资产阶级军事路线流毒，贯彻林副主席“少而精”的训练原则，以毛泽东思想为指针，进行军事训练。
    开始，有的同志把政治和军事平列起来，主张要搞训练就要“摆开摊子，拉开架子，象个样子”；也有的同志把军事训练和单纯军事观点混同起来，他们认为执行“三支”“两军”任务，再抓军事训练，那就是单纯军事观点。党支部针对这些活思想，发动大家以毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导为武器，对资产阶级军事路线进行了一次深入的批判。通过革命大批判，同志们认识到：政治和军事，政治总是第一，政治总是统帅，政治总是头。我们必须在政治挂帅的原则指导下搞好军事训练。把军事训练摆在压倒政治或者与政治平起平坐的地位，都是错误的。但是，笼统地认为抓军事训练就是单纯军事观点，也是不对的。林副主席早就指示过：“我们强调政治挂帅，但是，不要以为政治挂帅就不要军事，那是不行的。事情总是由几个方面合成的，缺了一样就不行。”有没有单纯军事观点，不在于搞不搞军事训练，而在于是不是真正懂得军事训练的政治意义，是不是以毛泽东思想为指针练好兵。现在连队执行“三支”“两军”任务，在同不拿枪的敌人作战的同时，练好同拿枪的敌人作战的过硬本领，这正是阶级斗争的需要，加强连队建设的需要，保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的需要。
    经过革命大批判，同志们提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，把军事训练也带动起来了，在紧张的“三支”“两军”工作中，按照四好的要求，贯彻“少而精”的训练原则，把军事训练作为一个重要方面抓起来。他们分散住在社员家里，每到“天天练”时间，有的在河滩练投弹，有的在田头练瞄准。大家在训练场地上，都把红彤彤的《毛主席语录》带在身边，随时针对自己的活思想，学习一段毛主席着重政治建军的伟大教导，狠批反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的单纯军事观点。同志们说：“红太阳照亮练兵场，心练红来眼发亮。”
    用毛泽东思想带兵，搞好生活管理
    八连在斗争实践中体会到：在新形势下搞好生活管理，最主要的是干部要学会用毛泽东思想带好兵，用政治思想好带动生活管理好。
    八连干部遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，密切联系群众，和战士同学毛主席著作，同开讲用会，同忆苦思甜，同斗私批修，干部同战士建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。他们既严格要求又耐心说服。有一段时间，部队露出了纪律松懈的苗头，党支部及时组织大家学习了毛主席关于“纪律是执行路线的保证”、“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”等教导，运用民主的、讨论的、说理的方法，使大家认识到：在阶级斗争的新形势下，不断增强组织纪律性，是巩固无产阶级专政的需要，是加强连队革命化建设的重要保证，从而把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。
    八连党支部既关心群众的生活，又坚持勤俭节约艰苦朴素的作风。这个连队投入“三支”“两军”工作以后，全连上下集中精力搞支左，一度对伙食管理有些忽视。连长程孟勇深入到炊事班，发现有的同志认为做饭不如支左光荣，不安心做炊事工作，便组织他们学习“老三篇”，引导大家用张思德同志“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，和白求恩同志“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的精神，对照检查自己，使大家提高了认识，增强了克服困难的决心。他们按照毛主席关于“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”的教导，在远离营房的情况下坚持养猪、种菜，做到肉菜基本自给。他们还响应毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，改灶三十多次，摸索出先进烧煤法，烧煤量从每天每人二斤半下降到三两左右，为国家节约了大量煤炭。
