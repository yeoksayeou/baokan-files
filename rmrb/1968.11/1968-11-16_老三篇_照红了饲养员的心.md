The brigade leader went out and encountered an old donkey that was about to be sent to the cooking pot. Seeing that the animal still had some life left, he bought it. This donkey was old and thin, with many problems. Some commune members saw it and angrily said, "What use is it?" Livestock keeper Niu Ruying, however, smiled and said, "Feed it, feed it, maybe it can give birth to a foal."

Niu Ruying is an experienced livestock keeper. In the old society, this poor child who couldn't even touch the fur of an animal was now able to feed a whole pen of livestock, and he was overjoyed. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the collective, feeding the livestock until they were plump and healthy. However, a few years ago, he was influenced by Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the "three selfs and one contract" and "work points as the key" revisionist poison in the countryside, and he no longer took care of the livestock with dedication. Later, the commune members no longer let him feed the livestock.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a vigorous campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has been launched in the countryside. Using the "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, a revolutionary criticism has been carried out, and the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line has been swept away. Niu Ruying, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings on having "no selfishness at all," fought against his own selfishness and greatly raised his consciousness. He decided to feed livestock for the revolution for the rest of his life!

From then on, Niu Ruying followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to demand of himself, and he took even more care in feeding the livestock. Since buying this "cooking pot donkey," he has never had a full night's sleep, always looking at the stars in the sky to feed the livestock, not missing a single moment. The pen is kept clean, the hay is chopped finely, the livestock's fur is brushed clean, and in just a few months, the "cooking pot donkey" has changed completely.

The "cooking pot donkey" finally gave birth to a foal. Niu Ruying guarded the foal all night, not daring to sleep. "The more you fear, the more the wolf comes to scare you." Six days later, the foal got rabies. Niu Ruying's heart was in turmoil—up and down like fifteen buckets of water being drawn from a well. He immediately called a veterinarian in the middle of the night. By dawn, the foal's condition had not improved, and his heart was knotted in a lump. Hearing that there was an old veterinarian in Qinghe who could treat this disease, he didn't care that he hadn't eaten for two days and two nights, and immediately set out, traveling over forty miles round trip to bring the doctor, who administered acupuncture. The foal then turned from danger to safety. The commune members saw the lively little foal jumping around and deeply felt: one "public," one "private," the difference is like heaven and earth. With the heart on the "public," even a "cooking pot donkey" can give birth to a foal. Now the "cooking pot donkey" is pregnant again.

　　“老三篇”照红了饲养员的心
    生产队长外出，遇上了一头正往汤锅上送的老草驴，他看这头牲口还有喂头，就买下了。这头驴又老又瘦，还有许多毛病。有的社员看了，生气地说“要它干啥？”饲养员牛儒营却笑着说：“将养将养，也许能添头骡驹。”
    牛儒营是个老饲养员，这个旧社会连根牲口毛也摸不着的穷孩子，能喂上一大槽牲口，打心眼里高兴。他一心贴到集体上，把牲口个个喂得膘肥体壮。可是，前些年他受了刘少奇在农村推行的“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货的影响，喂牲口不精心了，后来社员就不叫他喂了。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，在农村开展了轰轰烈烈的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，用“老三篇”为武器，开展了革命大批判，肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的流毒。牛儒营对照着毛主席“毫无自私自利之心”的教导，狠斗自己的私心，觉悟有很大提高。他决心为革命喂一辈子牲口！
    从此，牛儒营按照毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导来要求自己，比过去喂牲口还要操心。自从买来这头“上锅驴”，他从来没有睡过一个囫囵觉，老是瞅着天上的星星喂牲口，一时不错。圈垫得干干的，草铡得碎碎的，牲口毛扫得光光的，两三个月光景，“上锅驴”就大变样了。
      “上锅驴”终于下了小骡驹。牛儒营成夜守着骡驹不敢睡。“越是怕，狼来吓。”六天以后，小骡驹得了疯症。牛儒营的心象十五个吊桶打水——七上八下，他连夜请来兽医诊断。天亮了，骡驹病还不好，他的心揪成了一个疙瘩。听说清水河有个老兽医会看这种病，他顾不得自己两天两夜没吃饭，立即动身来回跑了四十多里路请来医生，扎了火针，小骡驹才转危为安。社员们看到那个欢蹦乱跳的小骡驹，深有感触地说：一个“公”，一个“私”，差别是天上地下。心在“公”字上，“上锅驴”也能下骡驹儿。现在“上锅驴”又怀驹了。
