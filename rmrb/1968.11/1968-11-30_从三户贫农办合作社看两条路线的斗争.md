Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in a very profound way: "If we only have state-owned economy without cooperative economy, we will not be able to lead the individual economy of the laboring people to gradually move towards collectivization, we will not be able to develop from the new democratic society to the future socialist society, and we will not be able to consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the state power."

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out the socialist direction for the countryside. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Village, followed Chairman Mao's instructions. In 1951, we established a mutual aid team, and in 1954, we set up three agricultural cooperatives, with more than 180 households joining. However, the evil gangster Liu Shaoqi saw that we were following Chairman Mao's socialist path and hated it to the core. Soon after we established the cooperatives, his agents in Hebei Province sent a "work team" to shout loudly about "welcoming those who withdraw from the cooperatives." While shouting, they wielded big axes to "chop down the cooperatives." By spring of 1955, the three cooperatives in our village were reduced to just one small cooperative with three poor peasants: Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoji, and Wang Xiaopang. Even this small cooperative, Liu Shaoqi and his agents would not let it be, insisting on forcibly disbanding it. The "work team" told Wang Yukun, "Three households are too small to be called a cooperative." Wang Yukun firmly replied, "Our path is correct. You can call it whatever you like!" He firmly pushed back the "work team."

At this critical moment, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao discovered this cooperative of three poor peasants and gave it the greatest support. Chairman Mao said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization": "The direction represented by these three poor peasants is the direction of the 500 million peasants in the whole country. All individual farming peasants will eventually follow the path that these three poor peasants have firmly chosen." Chairman Mao's instructions pointed out the direction for the 500 million peasants in the country. Inspired by Chairman Mao's instructions, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Village, firmly followed the path of these three poor peasants, advancing from the cooperatives to the broad road of people's communes. In just a few years, Nanwang Village underwent a tremendous change, with the grain yield per mu increasing from over 130 jin during the mutual aid team period to over 900 jin.

Liu Shaoqi failed to chop down the cooperatives and came up with another scheme. During a period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, he threw out the revisionist black goods of "three selfs and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to destroy the collective economy and drag us towards capitalism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Production Brigade, criticized these revisionist black goods and firmly resisted this evil wind.

"The enemy will not perish of itself." The more we achieve victory, the more the class enemy hates us. The great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hebei Province took the opportunity of the "Four Clean-ups" in 1964 to directly extend their black hands to Nanwang Village. They sent a three-anti element to our brigade, ostensibly to help with the "Four Clean-ups," but secretly engaging in unspeakable activities. This three-anti element colluded with the ghosts and monsters in our brigade, first targeting Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoji, and Wang Xiaopang, who were the most resolute in walking the socialist path. They spread rumors: "The small cooperative of three poor peasants is fake. Nanwang is not a red flag but a black flag!" and boasted: "Unless these three poor peasants are overthrown, Nanwang will never be able to turn over a new leaf!" and so on, attempting to negate the socialist direction and further dismantle the people's commune. At this time, the ghosts and monsters in our brigade also jumped out, clapping and cheering. It was not until the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that we found this ultimate backer and root of evil. The culprit who chopped down the cooperatives and attempted to restore capitalism was Liu Shaoqi.

In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of Nanwang Production Brigade set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism and denunciation, launching a fierce attack on the heinous crimes of the great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi in chopping down the cooperatives, and on his promotion of the revisionist black goods of "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "three selfs and one contract," and "four freedoms" to restore capitalism. Through exposure and criticism, we clearly saw that for many years, the Liu Shaoqi clique had been resisting and sabotaging Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are the sworn enemies of us poor and lower-middle peasants. To follow Chairman Mao's socialist path, we must resolutely fight against Liu Shaoqi and other representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party.

Practice has taught us that as long as class and class struggle exist, revolutionary criticism and denunciation must never stop. We are determined to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation to the end, to eliminate all the poison left by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi in the process of criticism and denunciation, to learn from the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the party, to further arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to raise our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and to advance in big strides along the socialist direction pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao!

    从三户贫农办合作社看两条路线的斗争
    河北省安平县南王庄大队革委会常委  刘新坦
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上极其深刻地指出：“单有国营经济而没有合作社经济，我们就不可能领导劳动人民的个体经济逐步地走向集体化，就不可能由新民主主义社会发展到将来的社会主义社会，就不可能巩固无产阶级在国家政权中的领导权。”
    毛主席给我们明确地指出了农村的社会主义方向。我们南王庄的贫下中农遵照毛主席的指示，在一九五一年成立了互助组，一九五四年又建立了三个农业生产合作社，一百八十多户农民入了社。可是刘少奇这个大坏蛋，看我们跟毛主席走社会主义道路，恨之入骨。在我们建社不久，他在河北省的代理人就派来“工作组”，大喊大叫什么“退社欢送”。一边叫喊，一边挥动大斧子“大砍合作社”。到一九五五年春天，我们村的三个合作社，只剩下王玉坤、王小其、王小庞三户贫农的一个小社了。就是这样一个小社，刘少奇及其代理人也不放过，硬要强行解散。“工作组”对王玉坤说：“三户太小，不能叫社。”王玉坤同志坚定地回答：“我们走的路对头，叫什么随你们的便！”硬把“工作组”顶了回去。
    就在这个关键时刻，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发现了这三户贫农办的合作社，给了最大的支持。毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》中说：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”毛主席的指示，给全国五亿农民指出了前进的方向。在毛主席指示的鼓舞下，我们南王庄的贫下中农，坚决走上这三户贫农所走的道路，从合作社一直踏上了人民公社的康庄大道。十几年的工夫，我们南王庄发生了天翻地覆的变化，粮食亩产量由互助组时期的一百三十多斤提高到九百多斤。
    刘少奇砍合作社不成，又生一计。在我国经济暂时困难时期，他又抛出了“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义黑货，妄图摧垮集体经济，把我们拉向资本主义。我们南王庄大队的贫下中农批判了这些修正主义黑货，坚决地顶住了这股妖风。
    “敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们越是胜利，阶级敌人越是仇视。大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其在河北省的代理人，借一九六四年“四清”的机会，又把黑手直接伸向我们南王庄。他们派了一个三反分子来我们大队，名义是帮助搞“四清”，暗地里却干着不可告人的勾当。这个三反分子勾结本大队的牛鬼蛇神，首先把矛头指向走社会主义道路最坚决的王玉坤、王小其、王小庞。他们造谣说：“三户贫农小社是假的，南王庄不是红旗是黑旗！”并扬言：“这三户贫农不倒，南王庄永远翻不了身！”等等，妄图否定社会主义方向，进一步搞垮人民公社。这时，我们大队的牛鬼蛇神也跳了出来，拍手叫好。直到这次无产阶级文化大革命，才找到了这个总后台，大祸根。原来大砍合作社，大搞复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首就是刘少奇。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们南王庄大队的贫下中农和革命群众，摆开了革命大批判的战场，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇大砍合作社的滔天罪行，对他所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等复辟资本主义的黑货，进行了狠揭猛批。通过大揭发、大批判，使我们清楚地看到，多少年来，刘少奇一伙一直在抗拒和破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们要跟毛主席走社会主义道路，就必须同刘少奇等埋藏在党内的资产阶级代表人物作坚决的斗争。
    实践教育了我们，阶级和阶级斗争存在一天，革命的大批判就一天不能停止。我们决心把革命的大批判进行到底，在大批判中肃清大叛徒刘少奇的一切流毒，在大批判中学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装起来，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指出的社会主义方向，大踏步地前进！
