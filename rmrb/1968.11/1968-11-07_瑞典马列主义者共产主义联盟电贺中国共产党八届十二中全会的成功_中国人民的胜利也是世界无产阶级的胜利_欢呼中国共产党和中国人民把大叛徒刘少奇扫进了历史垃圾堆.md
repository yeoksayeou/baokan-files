The Swedish Marxist-Leninist Communist Union Executive Committee sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on November 3, warmly congratulating the Communist Party of China on the convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee and the publication of the session's communiqué. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

We have learned of the communiqué issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 31, 1968. We extend fraternal congratulations on the brilliant victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as confirmed by this meeting. We are delighted to celebrate the important resolutions adopted at this meeting. This meeting is of the greatest historical significance and marks a milestone in the development of the international proletarian movement.

Due to the revisionists in the Soviet Union seizing party and state power and leading the Soviet Union down the capitalist road, the question of how the proletariat maintains and consolidates power under the dictatorship of the proletariat has become a decisive issue for the entire international communist movement.

Now in China, tens of millions of people, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and led by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core, have been mobilized to criticize and struggle against those bourgeois elements attempting to usurp the party, the government, and the army. This struggle, lasting over two years, has smashed the bourgeois revisionist clique and its accomplices at various levels and in various places. The establishment of revolutionary committees throughout the country, except for Taiwan Province, signifies the great and decisive victory of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Thus, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated throughout China, except for Taiwan Province.

This great political revolution—the successful counterattack of the working class against the bourgeoisie under the new historical condition of the dictatorship of the proletariat—demonstrates that the Communist Party of China is an outstanding Marxist-Leninist party. We are delighted to congratulate the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on its decision to remove Liu Shaoqi, the chief representative of the bourgeois line, from all his positions within the party and state apparatus. Even more delightful is that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have swept him and the line he represents into the dustbin of history.

The enemies of the people, led by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are frantically denouncing the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to obstruct the people's revolutionary struggle.

The U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam and the Soviet revisionist occupation of Czechoslovakia have exposed their imperialist nature to the people of the world. Now we see how U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have formed a "holy alliance" to divide the world.

The Soviet revisionists have betrayed socialism and the interests of the October Revolution. The social imperialists, who are socialists in words but imperialists in deeds, have seized power, not only oppressing the people of Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries but also oppressing the Soviet people. They have tarnished the reputation of the Soviet Party and are trying to deceive the people of the world by cloaking their malice in Marxist-Leninist rhetoric. However, their efforts are in vain. In a short period, the revisionists can deceive a part of the world, but the ninety percent of the world's population will ultimately choose the path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, through their resolute struggle against revisionism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have shown the people of the world the way forward. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese people have brilliantly further developed the path to socialism laid down by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In the struggle between the capitalist and socialist lines, the socialist line has triumphed.

The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the proletariat worldwide. Today, China stands together with socialist Albania, serving as a beacon and bastion of the world revolution.

We Swedish Marxist-Leninists, working in a capitalist country where the revolutionary movement is still weak but the people have newfound awareness, can learn a great deal from the victorious Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Our first task is to establish a Marxist-Leninist party capable of leading the Swedish people to victory in the socialist revolution. We must first study Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to every step and action we take. We must believe in the masses in all our actions. We must resolutely adhere to this line and, together with Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, contribute to the victory of the world revolution.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live proletarian internationalism!

    瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟电贺中国共产党八届十二中全会的成功
    中国人民的胜利也是世界无产阶级的胜利
    欢呼中国共产党和中国人民把大叛徒刘少奇扫进了历史垃圾堆
    新华社斯德哥尔摩五日电　瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟执行委员会，十一月三日打电报给中国共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的召开和全会公报的发表。贺电全文如下：
    我们获悉中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会于一九六八年十月三十一日通过的公报。我们对于这次会议所确认的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的光辉胜利表示同志般的祝贺。我们高兴地庆贺这次会议作出的重要决议。这次会议是一次具有最伟大的历史意义的会议，是国际无产阶级运动发展的一个里程碑。
    由于苏联的修正主义者篡夺了党政大权，把苏联引上了资本主义的道路，因此无产阶级如何在无产阶级专政的条件下保持和巩固政权已成为决定整个国际共产主义运动的命运的问题。
    现在在中国，亿万人民在毛泽东思想的哺育下和在毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下，已经动员起来对那些企图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级集团进行批判和斗争。历时两年多的这场大斗争已粉碎了资产阶级修正主义集团及其在各级和各地的同伙。全国除台湾省外全部成立革命委员会，这标志着中国共产党和中国人民的伟大的决定性胜利。从而在全中国除台湾省之外巩固了无产阶级专政。
    这场伟大的政治革命——工人阶级在无产阶级专政这个新的历史条件下成功地反击资产阶级——表明，中国共产党是杰出的马克思列宁主义的党。我们高兴地祝贺中国共产党中央委员会决定撤消资产阶级路线的总代表刘少奇在党内和国家机构中的一切职务。尤其令人高兴的是：中国共产党和中国人民把他和他所代表的这条路线扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
    以美帝和苏修为首的人民的敌人疯狂地诋毁中国人民革命的胜利成果和毛泽东思想，妄图阻挠人民开展革命斗争。
    美帝的侵越战争和苏修占领捷克斯洛伐克在世界人民面前暴露了它们国家的帝国主义本质。我们现在看到，美帝和苏修如何结成“神圣同盟”来瓜分世界。
    苏联的修正主义者已经背叛了社会主义和十月革命的利益。混进列宁和斯大林的党里来的社会帝国主义者，即口头上是社会主义者，而行动上是帝国主义者，篡夺了政权，不仅压迫捷克斯洛伐克和其他东欧国家的人民，而且也压迫苏联人民。他们使苏联党的信誉扫地，并力图把他们的恶意披上马克思列宁主义的词藻来欺骗世界人民。然而他们这样做是徒劳的。在短时间内，修正主义者能欺骗世界上的一部分人，但是占世界人口百分之九十的人定将选择马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的道路。
    由毛泽东同志领导的中国人民群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过他们坚决的反对修正主义的斗争已经向全世界人民指明了道路。因此毛泽东同志和中国人民光辉地进一步发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林所奠定的走向社会主义的道路。在资本主义和社会主义两条路线的斗争中，社会主义路线胜利了。
    中国人民的胜利也是全世界无产阶级的胜利。今天，中国同社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚站在一起，是世界革命的灯塔和堡垒。
    我们瑞典马克思列宁主义者在一个资本主义国家中工作，那里的革命运动还是弱的，但人民有了新的觉醒，我们从胜利的中国无产阶级文化大革命中可以学到许多东西。我们现在的第一个任务，是要建立一个能够领导瑞典人民走向社会主义革命胜利的马克思列宁主义政党。我们必须首先学习毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想运用到我们的每一个步骤和每一个行动中去，我们必须在我们的一切行动中相信群众。我们要坚决执行这条路线，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民一道，为世界革命的胜利作出贡献。
    中国共产党万岁！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
