The day the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was published, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. I listened to the radio and took notes. Every word in the communiqué struck a chord in our hearts, the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee unanimously decided to expel the traitor, enemy agent, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to strip him of all his Party and state posts. We fully support and endorse this wise decision.

In 1941, this big bad guy Liu Shaoqi, using the alias Hu Fu, came to Huaihai District to "direct" work, staying in our Hu Village Production Brigade in Zhouji Commune, Shuyang County. During this period, he didn't associate with us poor and lower-middle peasants at all but instead became thick as thieves with a few local bullies. He spouted "Confucian and Mencian doctrines" all day, peddling feudalist and bourgeois black goods. That year was a critical moment when the people of the whole country were fighting the War of Resistance against Japan under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. But the traitor Liu Shaoqi didn't mention the War of Resistance against Japan at all. Instead, he vigorously promoted "Confucian and Mencian doctrines," telling us to cultivate our moral character, emphasizing "benevolence," "harmony," and "reflecting on one's mistakes in seclusion." Now we see clearly that Liu Shaoqi's peddling of that black stuff was aimed at undermining the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people and sabotaging the War of Resistance against Japan. What he called "Confucian and Mencian doctrines" was actually a trick used by the feudal landlord class to rule and drug the people, aiming to make us endure humiliation, seek compromise, and become tame tools of the enemy. His so-called "Confucian and Mencian doctrines" were actually doctrines of betrayal and surrender, advocating surrendering to the enemy under white terror and selling out the revolution. Liu Shaoqi not only talked this way but also acted this way. He was the first to kneel down before the enemy under white terror, betraying and surrendering, which is an ironclad proof. His so-called "Confucian and Mencian doctrines" were actually doctrines of surrender, betrayal, and national ruin, advocating laying down arms before the enemy, kneeling down to beg for mercy, and becoming shameful slaves of the enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight our enemies to the end, the determination to restore our lost territories on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand on our own feet among the nations of the world." We poor and lower-middle peasants listen most to Chairman Mao's words, have the firmest revolutionary will, and the hardest bones. We resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the communiqué as a weapon, carry out thorough criticism and repudiation of the revolution, smash Liu Shaoqi's "Confucian and Mencian doctrines" to smithereens, and sweep Liu Shaoqi's traitorous philosophy into the dustbin of history.

    把刘少奇的叛徒哲学扫进历史垃圾堆
    江苏省沭阳县周集公社胡庄大队共产党员、贫农社员　朱连俊
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的那天夜里，我激动得一夜没睡着觉。我一边听广播，一边用心记。公报的话句句说到我们贫下中农的心窝里。党的八届十二中全会，一致通过决议，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外的一切职务。这一个英明决定，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持。
    一九四一年，刘少奇这个大坏蛋，化名为胡服，来到淮海区“指导”工作，住在我们沭阳县周集公社胡庄大队。在这段时间里，他根本不和我们贫下中农沾边，却和几个恶霸地主打得火热。他整天胡扯“孔孟之道”，大肆贩卖封建主义、资产阶级黑货。这一年，正是全国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下进行抗日战争的紧急时刻，而内奸刘少奇闭口不谈抗日战争，却十分卖力地鼓吹“孔孟之道”，要我们修身养性，大讲“仁爱”、“人和”、“闭门思过”。现在，我们看穿了，刘少奇贩卖那套黑货，其目的就是企图瓦解革命人民的斗志，破坏抗日战争。所谓“孔孟之道”，就是封建地主阶级用来统治、麻醉人民的鬼门道，就是要我们忍辱负重，委屈求全，服服贴贴做敌人的驯服工具。他的所谓“孔孟之道”，就是叛变自首之道，就是在敌人白色恐怖之下，乖乖地向敌人投降，出卖革命。刘少奇这样说，也是这样做的。他在白色恐怖中带头跪在敌人脚下，变节自首，就是一个铁证。所谓“孔孟之道”，也就是投降之道，卖国之道，亡国之道，就是在敌人面前，放下武器，跪地求饶，甘做可耻的亡国奴的活命哲学。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，革命意志最坚，骨头最硬，我们坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以公报为武器，深入开展革命大批判，把刘少奇宣扬的“孔孟之道”砸个稀巴烂，把刘少奇的叛徒哲学扫进历史垃圾堆。
