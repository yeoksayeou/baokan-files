Japanese students at Tokyo University and Nihon University, undeterred by the suppression of the reactionary Sato government and the sabotage by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique, continue their struggle against the rotten and reactionary educational system.

Progressive students at Tokyo University, who have been fighting since January this year, are currently holding a school-wide strike. They almost daily hold rallies and demonstrations in the campus. Students from the Faculty of Literature recently detained an extremely pro-American reactionary professor, Hayato Hayato.

The struggle of Nihon University students against the rotten educational system has lasted for more than six months. Students have built barricades around various buildings and annexes of the university and have repeatedly repelled police forces sent by the university authorities and the reactionary Sato government to suppress the student movement. Red flags flutter in the wind above these buildings, and battle slogans are posted all around.

The chairman of the university, Kozo Kozo, once again suppressed the progressive students. On November 8, the school authorities gathered about 300 thugs to disrupt the students' struggle in the Art Department. These thugs, wearing steel helmets and wielding weapons, rushed into the teaching building. The students bravely fought back and severely punished these thugs. The reactionary Sato government, which has been supporting Kozo Kozo, sent 700 armed police on the 12th to brutally suppress the students. The police fired more than 300 tear gas canisters and used water cannons to spray the school buildings. The students fought tenaciously with the police, throwing stones at them and holding out for nearly three hours. On that day, the police illegally arrested about 50 students. After hearing about the police's savage actions, hundreds of students rushed to the scene, built barricades at the entrance of the school building, and continued the strike.

The students' struggle has received strong support from their parents. About 12,000 student parents held a meeting in the school's auditorium, demanding that all board members resign immediately.

The brave and tenacious struggle of the students at these two universities has made the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique, led by Kyuemon, panic-stricken. They have been acting as the running dogs of the reactionary Sato government, fully exposing their counter-revolutionary and anti-people true colors. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique recently gathered a group of "party members" from various places and sent them to Tokyo University to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, removing the barricades built by progressive students and preventing the blockade of teaching buildings. On the evening of the 12th, after about 2,000 students at Tokyo University held a meeting in the Yasukuni Lecture Hall, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique sent a large number of thugs who attacked the progressive student ranks with sticks. The students fought fiercely with the revisionist elements.

The revolutionary students at Tokyo University have seen through the ugly face of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique. They are filled with indignation towards the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements and are determined to carry the struggle through to the end, thoroughly smashing the revisionist elements' plot to sabotage the students' just struggle.

　　日修充当反动政府镇压学生的帮凶，激起学生极大愤怒
    新华社十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京大学和日本大学的进步学生，不顾佐藤反动政府的镇压和日共修正主义集团的破坏，继续展开斗争，反对腐朽、反动的教育制度。
    从今年一月以来一直在坚持斗争的东京大学的进步学生，目前继续举行全校性罢课，他们几乎每天在大学校园里举行集会和游行示威。文学学部的学生们最近把一名极端亲美的反动教授林健太郎拘留起来。
    日本大学的学生反对腐朽的教育制度的正义斗争，已经坚持了六个多月。学生们在大学的各座大楼和附属建筑物周围筑起了路障，并且多次击退了大学当局和佐藤反动政府派来镇压学生运动的警察部队。在这些建筑物的上空，红旗迎风飘扬。建筑物四周到处张贴着战斗性的标语。
    这所大学的董事长古田重二良再一次向进步学生进行镇压。十一月八日，学校当局纠集了大约三百名暴徒，企图破坏大学艺术学部的学生斗争。这些暴徒头戴钢盔，手执凶器，冲进了教学楼，学生们英勇地进行了还击，并且严惩了这些暴徒。一直支持古田重二良的佐藤反动政府十二日也派出七百名武装警察，再一次对学生进行野蛮镇压。警察向学生发射了三百多发催泪弹，并用水龙头向学校的建筑物喷射。学生们同警察进行了顽强的斗争，向他们投掷石块，坚持战斗将近三个小时。这一天，警察非法逮捕了大约五十名学生。几百名学生获悉警察的野蛮行径之后，就赶到现场，在学校大楼的进口处筑起了路障，并守在路障后面坚持罢课。
    学生们的斗争得到了他们的家长的大力支持。大约一万二千名学生家长在学校大礼堂举行集会，要求全部董事立即辞职。
    这两所大学学生英勇顽强的斗争，使日共宫本修正主义集团惊慌失措，它们极力充当佐藤反动政府的帮凶角色，充分暴露了它的反革命、反人民的真面目。日共宫本修正主义集团最近纠集了在各地的一批“党员”，把他们派到东京大学去进行反革命活动，拆除进步学生筑起的路障，阻止学生封锁教学楼。十二日晚上，东京大学的大约两千名学生在安田讲堂举行大会后，日共修正主义集团派出了大批暴徒，他们挥动棍棒袭击进步学生队伍。学生们同日修分子进行了激烈的搏斗。
    东京大学的革命学生识破了日共宫本修正主义集团的丑恶面目，他们对日共修正主义分子怀着满腔怒火，决心把斗争进行到底，彻底粉碎这些修正主义分子企图破坏学生正义斗争的阴谋。
