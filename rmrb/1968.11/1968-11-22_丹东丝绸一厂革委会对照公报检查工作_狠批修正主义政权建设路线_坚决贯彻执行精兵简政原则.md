Dan Dong Silk Factory Revolutionary Committee Reviews Work in Light of the Bulletin
Fiercely Criticizes the Revisionist Line on State Power Construction and Resolutely Implements the Principle of Streamlining and Reducing Bureaucracy

Through revolutionary criticism and the elimination of revisionist influence, based on discussions among the masses, the factory further streamlined its organizations and staff. The Revolutionary Committee has become more closely connected with the masses and has been welcomed by the workers.

The Dan Dong Silk Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, used the bulletin of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as a weapon to mobilize the masses to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in state power construction. This helped the Revolutionary Committee overcome conservative thinking and thoroughly implement the principle of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, further promoting the development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the Revolutionary Committee of the Dan Dong Silk Factory was established in May this year, it followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," abolished the old organizations, and reduced the number of staff from the original 120 to 33. With the help of the stationed military propaganda team, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieved significant results in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, becoming an advanced unit in the sericulture and silk industry system of Liaoning Province and within Dan Dong City.

However, due to some members of the Revolutionary Committee neglecting their own revolutionization, staying above and busy with administrative tasks, they gradually felt that there were not enough people. Within just five months, the number of personnel increased to 49. The broad revolutionary masses first raised objections to this change. An old worker sincerely and seriously said to the members of the Revolutionary Committee: "You are always busy up there, far away from us, and you can't hear our opinions. If you continue like this, we won't be at ease!" This old worker's pointed criticism had a significant impact on the members of the Revolutionary Committee.

After the bulletin of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the stationed military propaganda team, seriously studied the great combat tasks proposed in the bulletin and reviewed the situation of the Revolutionary Committee after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy in the light of the spirit of the bulletin. At this time, everyone realized that whether the newly born Revolutionary Committee would follow the old path of detachment from the masses or the new path of connection with the masses was a reflection of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the issue of state power construction. Continuing down the old path would lead to a slippery slope. With the help of the stationed military propaganda team, the Revolutionary Committee immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the main content of implementing the bulletin and thoroughly streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a single moment be detached from the masses." In the study class, the stationed Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team used this great teaching of Chairman Mao to inspire everyone to summarize and review the work of the Revolutionary Committee in implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy from the height of the struggle between the two lines. Many people checked their conservative thinking on this issue. Some said: "In the past, I always thought that the more activities I engaged in above, the more I could grasp the overall situation and play the role of a revolutionary cadre." Others said: "In the past, I thought that representing the revolutionary masses to come in and take power was more important than going down, so I rarely went down." Through study, everyone realized that these thoughts were wrong. Staying above to handle official business was to make the masses serve the organs, to serve "being an official and acting like a lord," which was essentially not handling "public" affairs but handling "private" affairs. Due to the influence of these old thoughts and habits, the revolutionization of the thoughts of the members of the Revolutionary Committee was greatly obstructed, and the newly born Revolutionary Committee gradually returned to the old path. Everyone analyzed that the root cause of these phenomena was mainly that the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in state power construction had not been thoroughly eliminated, and the old habits of the exploiting class of acting like a lord had not been thoroughly swept away.

Therefore, with the help of the stationed military propaganda team, they carried out a thorough revolutionary criticism, setting up revolutionary criticism battlefields in workshops, dormitories, and factory grounds, concentrating their efforts to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line on state power construction, further exposing the crimes of the factory's capitalist roaders in long-term establishment of a large bureaucratic organization and implementing control, restriction, and oppression on workers. Through revolutionary criticism, the members of the Revolutionary Committee further realized that the leadership cadre is the state power, and the relationship between the leadership cadre and the masses is the fundamental issue of proletarian state power construction. The members of the Revolutionary Committee must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "being both an 'official' and a 'commoner,'" forever rooting themselves among the masses, so as to forever be heart to heart with the masses, and the Revolutionary Committee can forever maintain revolutionary vigor.

After everyone's understanding was raised, the stationed military propaganda team, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," mobilized the masses to discuss what offices the factory Revolutionary Committee should set up and who should stay to work, fully. Finally, based on the opinions of the masses, starting from the perspective of being beneficial to closely connecting with the masses, facilitating mass supervision, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, the Revolutionary Committee's organizations were further streamlined, merging four groups into one office and reducing 28 office workers.

Subsequently, the members of the factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to connect with the masses," with the help of the stationed military propaganda team, established a new system of rotating duty on a regular basis. Except for two committee members on duty, other committee members all went to the workshops to study and work with the workers, jointly implementing the combat tasks proposed in the bulletin, and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the factory.

In this way, the number of office workers in the Revolutionary Committee was reduced, but the work done was increased, with one person being able to do the work of several; the number of people in the office was reduced, and the number of people going down was increased, and they were always propagating Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting proletarian politics, which was welcomed by the broad masses of workers. Revolutionary mass representative and worker Yu Xianwen, who had just entered the Revolutionary Committee, soon became detached from the masses. Some workers said he was "tied up by affairs, not touching labor, walking the old path, and not closely following the highest directive." Now, after going down, he uses the bulletin as a weapon to organize the masses to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, leading the masses to focus on revolution and vigorously promote production, and together with the masses, successfully completing a technological innovation that had been suppressed for many years by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," solving a long-standing problem in production. The masses praised: The Revolutionary Committee does this, we trust.

### 丹东丝绸一厂革委会对照公报检查工作  狠批修正主义政权建设路线  坚决贯彻执行精兵简政原则

    丹东丝绸一厂革委会对照公报检查工作
    狠批修正主义政权建设路线  坚决贯彻执行精兵简政原则
    经过革命大批判，肃清修正主义流毒，在群众讨论的基础上，再一次精简了机构和办事人员，革委会更加密切联系群众，受到职工的欢迎
    本报讯　辽宁省丹东丝绸一厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，以党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为武器，发动群众狠批刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，帮助革委会克服保守思想，彻底实行精兵简政，进一步推动了斗、批、改的发展。
    丹东丝绸一厂革委会今年五月成立后，就遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，取消了旧机构，工作人员由原来的一百二十名精简为三十三名。他们在驻军宣传队帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在斗、批、改中作出了不少成绩，成为辽宁省柞蚕丝绸工业系统和丹东市内的一个先进单位。
    但是，由于革委会的部分成员忽视了自身的革命化，浮在上面忙于事务，越来越感到人少不够用。短短的五个月里，人员又逐渐增加到四十九人。广大革命群众对这种变化首先提出了意见。一位老工人对革委会的成员严肃而诚恳地说：“你们成天坐在上面忙忙碌碌，离我们远远的，听不到我们的意见，再这样下去，我们可不放心哪！”这个老工人一针见血的批评，对革委会成员触动很大。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，革委会在驻军宣传队帮助下，认真学习公报提出的伟大战斗任务，对照公报的精神，检查了革委会精兵简政后的情况。这时，大家认识到，新生的革委会是走脱离群众的旧道路，还是走联系群众的新道路，这是在政权建设问题上，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和刘少奇反革命修正主义路线斗争的反映。继续沿着旧路子走下去，就要滑到邪路上去。在驻军宣传队帮助下，革委会立即举办了以落实公报、认真搞好精兵简政为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”在学习班里，驻军毛泽东思想宣传队用毛主席的这一伟大教导，启发大家从两条路线斗争的高度总结检查革委会实行精兵简政的工作。不少人检查了在这个问题上的保守思想。有的说：“过去总觉得在上面活动的多，才能掌握全面情况，才能发挥革命干部的骨干作用。”有的说：“过去认为自己是代表革命群众进来掌权的，下去不如在上面掌权重要，所以很少下去。”通过学习，大家认识到这些思想都是错误的，坐在上面办公就是让群众为机关服务，为自己“当官作老爷”服务，这实质上不是办“公”，而是办“私”。由于这些旧思想和旧习惯的作怪，革委会成员的思想革命化就受到了很大阻碍，新生的革委会也就逐渐地走上旧路子了。大家分析，产生这些现象的根源，主要是由于刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒还没彻底肃清，剥削阶级遗留下来的当官作老爷的旧习惯势力的影响还没彻底扫除。
    于是，他们在驻军宣传队帮助下，深入地开展了革命的大批判，在车间、宿舍、厂院到处摆开革命大批判的战场，集中力量狠批刘少奇的修正主义政权建设路线，进一步揭发厂里的走资派长期以来搞庞大的官僚机构，对工人实行管、卡、压的罪行。通过革命大批判，革委会成员进一步认识到：领导班子就是政权，领导班子与群众的关系问题，是无产阶级政权建设的根本问题。革委会成员只有坚决执行毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的指示，永远扎根于群众之中，才能永远同群众心连心，革委会才能永远保持革命的朝气。
    大家的认识提高后，驻军宣传队又同革委会成员一起，遵照毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，发动群众对厂革委会应当设置什么办事机构，要留那些人工作，进行充分讨论。最后根据群众的意见，从有利于密切联系群众、便于群众监督和发挥群众的积极性出发，对革委会机构再一次精简，将四个组并为一个办公室，减去了二十八名办事人员。
    随后，厂革命委员会的成员遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，在驻军宣传队帮助下，建立了定期轮流值班的新制度，除两名委员值班外，其他委员都到车间同工人一起学习和劳动，共同落实公报提出的战斗任务，认真搞好工厂的斗、批、改。
    这样，革委会办事人员少了，工作做得多了，一个能顶几个用；在机关的人少了，下去的人多了，并且时时刻刻宣传毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，受到了广大职工的欢迎。革命群众代表、工人于宪文同志刚进革委会不久就脱离群众，有的工人说他是“事务缠住身，劳动不沾身，新人走旧路，最高指示不紧跟”。现在，他下去以后，用公报为武器，组织群众狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义办企业路线，带领群众狠抓革命，猛促生产，同群众一起，突击搞成一项被走资派和反动技术“权威”压制多年的技术革新，解决了生产上的老大难问题。群众赞扬说：革委会这样做，我们信得过。　　柞跟东　丹军
