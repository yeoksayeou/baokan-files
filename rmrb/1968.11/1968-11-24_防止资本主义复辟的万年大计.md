Edition: 4

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." Studying Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, and reflecting on the long-term class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-line struggle in our brigade, the more we study, the more we feel it is on the right path, the more we study, the more we feel it is close to our hearts!

Our brigade was once a famous poor swamp in the old society. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were cruelly exploited and oppressed by the three big enemies, with nine out of ten households wandering and begging. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we relied on collective strength to eradicate the disasters of alkalinity and waterlogging. The lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants improved as if they had gone from the eighteenth level of hell to heaven. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand the bitterness of the past and wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path. However, before the Cultural Revolution, due to the obstruction of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in our locality, every step we took forward was met with obstruction. They either said we were taking big steps, "rushing ahead," "doing it too early," or tried to lead us down the wrong path. For example, in 1960, the big traitor Liu Shaoqi spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms." When this black wind blew to our brigade, it was immediately welcomed by his agents and class enemies in the brigade. In our ninth team, they carried out "contracting production to households," "releasing livestock," and "small-scale reclamation" as "pilot projects." This caused the class enemies to be overjoyed and active. Some members, under their deception and influence, temporarily could not distinguish the direction, using fertilizer and labor on the reclaimed land and "contract fields." The poor and lower-middle peasants watched as large plots of land were left fallow, and could only worry and fret, with strength but no way to use it. As a result, more than 270 acres of rice were severely reduced, and even the members' rations were not enough. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "If we continue like this, we will have to return to the old society, with the landlords' bellies full and the poor and lower-middle peasants begging again." Facing this profound lesson, the poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "only socialism can save China," engaged in extensive reminiscences and comparisons, and raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They said: "We cannot go back, we must follow Chairman Mao on the bright socialist path." From then on, small plots of land were handed over to the collective, and the team organized reclamation, expanding the cultivated area and consolidating the collective economy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism is a possibility at any time." In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi's agents in our brigade again spread economism, shouting slogans such as "collective pig raising results in losses, selling the forest farm can give each household hundreds of yuan, reserve grain can be distributed to each household for safekeeping." They killed the collective's breeding pigs, forcibly distributed more than 140,000 jin of reserve grain to the members, and planned to cut down the collective forest farm all at once. The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through their wolfish ambitions and engaged in a head-on struggle with them, exposing these bad guys' evil schemes to restore capitalism.

Through the revolutionary criticism, our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a clearer understanding of the reactionary face of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi and his gang, and their awareness of class struggle and line struggle has greatly increased. We deeply realize: Liu Shaoqi and the big and small capitalist-roaders in the Party are the most dangerous and despicable enemies on the socialist road. Only by thoroughly eliminating them can Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line be unobstructed. The poor and lower-middle peasants have deep feelings: "The old scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents advocate 'three freedoms and one contract,' 'four freedoms,' and 'material incentives,' which is to use money to buy our hearts, then seize our power, monopolize our politics, and finally take our lives." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a thousand-year plan and a ten-thousand-year plan to oppose revisionism and prevent revisionism. Everyone expressed: We must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," thoroughly criticize the "self," thoroughly establish the "public," thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly destroy the ideological foundation for the restoration of capitalism, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color.

    防止资本主义复辟的万年大计
    辽宁营口县水源公社水源大队三队贫协组长　刘国田
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”学习毛主席这一光辉指示，联想我们大队长期以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，越学越觉得对路，越学越觉得亲切！
    我们水源在旧社会是有名的穷洼塘。广大贫下中农在三大敌人的残酷剥削和压迫下，十有九家流离失所，逃荒要饭。解放后，在毛主席的英明领导下，靠集体力量根治了碱涝灾害，贫下中农的生活好象从十八层地狱一步登上了天堂。我们贫下中农深知过去的苦，一心跟毛主席走社会主义道路。可是文化大革命以前，由于党内头号走资派刘少奇和他在本地的代理人挡道，我们每向前走一步，都要受到阻挠。他们不是说咱步子迈大了，“冒进了”，“办早了”，就是拉我们拐弯抹角地往邪路上走。比如一九六○年，大叛徒刘少奇大刮“三自一包”“四大自由”的黑风。这股黑风一吹到水源，立刻得到了他在水源大队的代理人和阶级敌人的拍手欢迎，在我们九队也大搞“包产到户”、“牲畜下放”和“小开荒”的“试点”。这一来，阶级敌人眉开眼笑，一个个都活动起来。有的社员在他们的蒙蔽和影响下，一时辨别不清方向，把肥料和劳力都用到开荒地和“包产田”里去了。贫下中农眼瞅着大块地撂荒了，只好干着急，有劲也使不上。结果，二百七十多亩水稻严重减产，连社员的口粮都没打够。贫下中农气愤地说：“再这样搞下去，还得和旧社会一样，地主的肚子大了，贫下中农又得逃荒要饭。”在深刻的教训面前，贫下中农反复学习毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的伟大教导，大搞回忆对比，提高了路线斗争觉悟。他们说：“回头路可走不得，一定要跟毛主席走社会主义的光明大道。”从这以后，小块地交给了集体，小队组织起来开荒，扩大了耕地面积，巩固了集体经济。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”无产阶级文化大革命初期，刘少奇在我们水源的代理人，又大搞经济主义，叫喊什么“集体养猪死赔钱，卖掉林场每户能分几百元，储备粮可以分到各户保管。”他们把集体的种猪杀掉了，把十四万多斤储备粮强行分给了社员，还要把集体林场一下砍光。用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，看穿了他们的狼子野心，和他们展开针锋相对的斗争，揭穿了这些坏家伙妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当。
    通过革命大批判，我们广大贫下中农对大叛徒刘少奇一伙的反动嘴脸认识得越来越清楚，阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。我们深深认识到：刘少奇和党内大大小小的走资派，是社会主义道路上最危险、最可恶的敌人。只有把他们彻底清除，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线才能畅通无阻。贫下中农深有感触地说：“刘少奇这个老坏蛋和他的代理人鼓吹的‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’、‘物质刺激’，就是想用钱买我们心，然后夺我们权，专我们政，最后要我们命。”伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是反修防修的千年大计，万年大计。大家表示：一定要遵照毛主席的“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的流毒，彻底摧毁复辟资本主义的思想基础，保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
