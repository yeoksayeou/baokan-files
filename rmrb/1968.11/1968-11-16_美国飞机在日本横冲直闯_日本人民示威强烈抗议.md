	U.S. planes rampage in Japan
	Japanese people stage strong protests

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 15th, Tokyo: A U.S. military plane took off from the U.S. military base in Banzu, Fukuoka Prefecture, and crashed on the 14th into a farmer's field in Fukuoka Prefecture, destroying the farmer's land and house. This atrocity further aroused the strong indignation and protests of the broad masses of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism.

	On the afternoon of the 14th, patriotic youth and people from all walks of life in Fukuoka held meetings and demonstrated in front of the U.S. Consulate and the Banzu U.S. military base in Fukuoka City, strongly protesting against the U.S. military's atrocities and resolutely demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

	A group of patriotic youth staged a sit-in protest in front of the U.S. Consulate, continuing until after nine o'clock in the evening.

	At 7:30 p.m. on the 14th, the U.S. military stationed in Japan shamelessly attempted to remove the wreckage of the plane from the scene, trying to destroy the evidence of their crime. However, they immediately faced strong protests and condemnation from local farmers, forcing the Americans to retreat with their tails between their legs.

　　美国飞机在日本横冲直闯
    日本人民示威强烈抗议
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：由日本福冈县板付美军基地起飞的一架美国强盗军用飞机十四日坠落在福冈县的一家农民的田园里，毁坏了农民的土地房屋。这一暴行进一步激起了广大日本人民对美帝国主义的强烈愤慨和抗议。
    福冈的爱国青年学生和各阶层人民十四日下午纷纷举行集会，并到设在福冈市的美国领事馆和板付美军基地前进行示威，强烈抗议美军暴行，坚决要求废除日美“安全条约”和撤销美国军事基地。
    有一批爱国青年学生在美国领事馆门前展开静坐斗争，一直坚持到晚上九点多钟。
    十四日下午七点半，驻日美军竟无耻地到现场要强行搬走飞机的残骸，企图消毁罪证。但立即遭到当地农民的强烈抗议和谴责，迫使美国佬夹着尾巴溜走。
