The workers' propaganda teams stationed in various sectors of the superstructure in the capital, with deep proletarian sentiments of unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have swiftly launched a campaign to seriously study and enthusiastically promote the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great directive that "the working class must lead everything," to unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and to implement the great battle calls proposed by the plenum. They will strive to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure.

In recent days, various workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital have held celebration meetings, study discussion meetings, and oath-taking rallies. They have also organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the team members to seriously study and implement the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University made a decision on the evening of the communiqué's publication to resolutely implement the communiqué. They required the team members to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They aimed to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Members of the workers' propaganda teams stationed at the Beijing Film Studio and the Central Conservatory of Music, among other units, discussed the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the glorious historical mission of the working class in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They enthusiastically praised the great leadership of Chairman Mao. Many team members, after studying the communiqué, looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao, held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and said excitedly: Chairman Mao has sent us, the working class, to lead the struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure. This is the greatest trust in us. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and the unified command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will surely complete the great historical mission entrusted to us by the working class by Chairman Mao. We will turn every sector of the superstructure into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Some workers' propaganda teams also went to Tiananmen Square, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, and swore: We are determined to contribute all our strength to complete the great battle tasks proposed by the plenum communiqué!

During the study of the communiqué, many workers' propaganda teams used the communiqué as a mirror to summarize their experiences and formulate measures to further improve the struggle, criticism, and reform. The workers' and PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Central Academy of Fine Arts launched the "Study the Communiqué, Find Gaps" activity. The workers' and PLA propaganda team stationed at Beijing No. 23 Middle School, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, carried out activities of studying, discussing the great significance of the communiqué, investigating the poison of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, and criticizing the revolutionary line. This made the flames of revolutionary criticism burn even more fiercely, and the teachers and students are further deeply criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in the school. The workers' and PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Beijing Petroleum Institute led the broad revolutionary teachers and students to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the "class struggle extinction theory," "taming tool theory," "join the party to become an official theory," "theory of the backwardness of the masses," "theory of party peace," and "theory of public-private fusion" of the number one capitalist roader within the party Liu Shaoqi. They swept away the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts spread by Liu Shaoqi. Many units' workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team members and the broad revolutionary masses, while criticizing Liu Shaoqi, also criticized the "February Countercurrent" of 1967 and the evil wind this spring that attempted to reverse the "February Countercurrent." They expressed their firm support for the Eighth Plenum's decision to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the party permanently and to revoke all his party and non-party positions. They also firmly supported the plenum's serious criticism of the "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind that attempted to reverse it.

The broad workers' propaganda team members, during the study of the communiqué, followed Chairman Mao's directive that "the working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle," to strengthen their own ideological revolutionization. The workers' and PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe conducted self-criticism and criticism of revisionism in light of the communiqué and held a meeting to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The workers and the PLA also formed pairs to offer suggestions to each other and boost morale. Through these activities, the team members further improved their political awareness. They said: To build the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe into a highly proletarianized and highly combative revolutionary model troupe, we must first improve our own revolutionization. We must always be alert to the sabotage of class enemies and the infiltration of the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie to complete this glorious mission.

    新华社七日讯　进驻上层建筑各个领域的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，迅速掀起认真学习、热情宣传党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的热潮，决心遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，团结广大革命群众，贯彻执行全会提出的各项伟大战斗号召，为完成上层建筑斗、批、改任务而奋斗。
    最近几天，首都各个工人毛泽东思想宣传队纷纷举行了庆祝会、学习座谈会和誓师大会，举办了宣传队员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习和落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报。驻清华大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队在公报发表的当天晚上，就作出坚决贯彻公报的决定，要求宣传队员把活学活用毛主席著作，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，胜利完成斗、批、改的各项任务。进驻北京电影制片厂和中国音乐学院等许多单位的工人宣传队队员，在毛泽东思想学习班中，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和工人阶级肩负的伟大光荣的历史使命，热烈赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。许多队员学习了公报，眼望着伟大领袖毛主席像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激动地说：毛主席派我们工人阶级进驻上层建筑领导斗、批、改，这是对我们最大的信任。我们有毛泽东思想引路，有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统一号令，一定能够完成毛主席交给我们工人阶级的伟大历史使命，把上层建筑各个领域办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。有的工人宣传队还到天安门前，面对着伟大领袖毛主席的画像宣誓：决心为完成全会公报所提出的各项伟大战斗任务贡献自己的一切力量！
    在学习公报的过程中，许多工人宣传队，都以公报为镜子，总结经验，订出进一步搞好斗、批、改的措施。驻中央美术学院的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队员，开展了“学公报，找差距”的活动。驻北京二十三中的工人、解放军宣传队，和学校的革命师生一起，开展了一学、二摆（摆公报的伟大意义）、三查（查叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的流毒）、四批（开展革命大批判）的活动，使革命大批判的烈火燃烧得更旺，师生们正进一步深入地批判刘少奇及其在本校的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。进驻北京石油学院的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队领导广大革命师生，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”“驯服工具论”“入党做官论”“群众落后论”“党内和平论”“公私溶化论”，肃清刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义思想。许多单位的工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员和广大革命群众在批判刘少奇的同时，还批判了一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风，他们表示，坚决拥护八届十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务的英明决定，坚决拥护全会对于“二月逆流”和为“二月逆流”翻案的妖风的严肃批判。
    广大工人宣传队队员在学习公报的过程中，遵照毛主席的“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，加强自身的思想革命化。驻北京京剧团的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队员，对照公报进行斗私批修，并且举行了活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会。工人和解放军还结成了一对红，相互提意见，鼓干劲。队员们通过这些活动，进一步提高了政治觉悟。他们说：我们要把北京京剧团建设成一个非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命样板团，首先必须搞好自身的革命化，时刻警惕阶级敌人的破坏和资产阶级糖衣炮弹的侵蚀，才能完成这个光荣任务。
