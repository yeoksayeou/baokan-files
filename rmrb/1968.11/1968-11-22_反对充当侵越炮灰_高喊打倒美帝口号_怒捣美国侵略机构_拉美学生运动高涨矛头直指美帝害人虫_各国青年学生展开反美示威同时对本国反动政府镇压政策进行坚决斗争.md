Student movements in some Latin American countries are continuing to develop, with their struggle increasingly directed against U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

In San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, which is under U.S. colonial rule, a group of demonstrators held an anti-draft protest on the 19th. They smashed the windows of the Federal Building with stones. Before the march, they held a rally, firmly opposing the U.S. colonial authorities' forced conscription of Puerto Rican youth to serve as cannon fodder in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression. Currently, a large number of Puerto Rican youths who refuse to serve in the U.S. military are being charged with "draft evasion" and await trial.

Students at the University of Concepción in Chile chanted anti-U.S. imperialism slogans during a demonstration on the 17th and smashed the U.S. Information Service office in Concepción.

More than 12,000 students at the National Technical University of Chile began an indefinite strike on the 19th, demanding that the government provide funds for school activities. A group of students from this university marched through the streets of downtown Santiago on the 19th despite the savage suppression by the police.

About 10,000 students in Mexico City held an angry rally on the evening of the 19th, vowing to continue their just struggle against persecution and massacre for more than three months. They reiterated that if the government authorities do not stop all suppression and release all detained students, they will not return to classes.

More than 1,000 students at the University of San Marcos in the Peruvian capital of Lima held a demonstration against the school authorities on the 19th. They engaged in a three-hour fierce struggle with the police force that suppressed the students, resulting in eight students injured and twenty students arrested. Recently, similar intense student protests have also erupted in Trujillo and other cities in northern Peru.

Students at a high school in Tuluá, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, who have been on strike for half a month to demand the replacement of the principal, bravely fought back against the police force that attempted to occupy the school on the 14th.

Students at the Central University of Venezuela in the capital Caracas held a strike on the 12th, demanding an increase in the education budget and improvement of school teaching conditions. On the evening of the 11th, students held a protest rally and occupied the school's medical college.

Uruguayan students, who have long been fighting against suppression, took to the streets to demonstrate on October 29th and November 6th, strongly protesting the government's so-called "emergency security measures." The demonstrators engaged in fierce struggles with the police who came to suppress them.
