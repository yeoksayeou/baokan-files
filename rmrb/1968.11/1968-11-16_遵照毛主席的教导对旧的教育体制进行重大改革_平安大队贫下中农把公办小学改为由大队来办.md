The poor and lower-middle peasants of Ping'an Brigade in Ping'an Commune, Qing'an County, Heilongjiang Province, have implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "in rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." They have carried out a major reform of the old educational system by converting public primary schools into brigade-run schools. The teachers in these brigade-run schools are both teachers and commune members, do not receive state salaries, and earn work points to participate in the distribution of the production team. This major reform has ensured that the power of rural education is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and has effectively promoted the thought reform of teachers.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade made the decision to convert all public primary schools into brigade-run schools after careful comparison. Originally, there were five public and brigade-run primary schools in this brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants witnessed and experienced firsthand that the public schools led by the old county education bureau were "independent kingdoms" in the brigade. They did not listen to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants based on Mao Zedong Thought, nor did they run the schools according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In contrast, the brigade-run schools followed the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants and operated according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. The teachers in the public and brigade-run schools also showed stark differences. The twelve teachers in the public schools received state salaries and thus detached themselves from labor, with their thoughts and feelings alienated from those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In contrast, the five teachers in the brigade-run schools were selected by the masses from among the poor and lower-middle peasants. They did not receive state salaries but participated in the brigade's distribution, actively participated in labor, and had a deep bond with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants summarized six advantages of the brigade-run schools and their teachers based on their personal experiences:

(1) The brigade-run schools, managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, educate students according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants using Mao Zedong Thought. The teachers of the brigade-run schools, coming from the poor and lower-middle peasants, have a deep proletarian affection for Chairman Mao. They listen to Chairman Mao's words and strictly follow his instructions. The teachers of the brigade-run schools teach their first lesson on "Serving the People" and have students write "Long Live Chairman Mao" as their first characters. The teachers of the brigade-run schools often invite old poor peasants to share their bitter experiences with the students and teach them class education. When asked why they study, a nine-year-old student taught by a brigade-run school teacher immediately replied, "To serve the people!" However, a second-grade student taught by a public school teacher answered, "To grow up and become an official in the city."

(2) The brigade-run schools are part of the production team, and the teachers have a close bond with the poor and lower-middle peasants, showing the greatest concern for the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The teachers of the brigade-run schools allow students to bring their younger siblings to school, and for students who have too much housework to attend school, the teachers go to their homes to teach. In Ping'an Brigade's Second Team, two children were responsible for herding pigs for the production team. The teachers of the brigade-run schools encouraged them to take good care of the pigs for the collective while teaching them individually in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Now, these two children have been promoted to the fourth grade.

(3) With the schools run by the brigade, the teachers, who are both teachers and commune members, show the greatest concern for the class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment—the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants say they are "capable of both ascending and descending, literate and martial, good advisors for the production team, and good helpers for the commune members." In addition to teaching, they are also Mao Zedong Thought propagandists for the production team, tutors for study classes, and participate in learning, criticizing revisionism, and discussing the production and work of the production team with the commune members. Some of them have even taken on roles such as deputy platoon leader of the militia and members of the revolutionary committee. Some public school teachers, however, spend all day in the small world of the school, have no contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and do not care about the affairs of the production team. The poor and lower-middle peasants are dissatisfied and say, "Public school teachers are 'overseas kings,' they don't think, speak, or act with us."

(4) The teachers of the brigade-run schools come from the poor and lower-middle peasants and bring the essence of the poor and lower-middle peasants into the school, passing it on to the students. They not only teach but also farm, working with the commune members in the morning and then returning to teach, and after school, they go to the production team to find work. Their simple and honest style has a good influence on the students.

(5) The teaching of the brigade-run schools follows the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, starting from the needs of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, closely linking theory with practice, unlike the public school teachers who spend all day memorizing books and chasing after scores. Since 1964, the Second Team's brigade-run school has prioritized the teaching of Chairman Mao's works and class education courses. At the same time, based on the needs of the countryside, courses such as "Knowledge of Socialist Collective Economy" and "Farm Miscellaneous Characters" were set up. Teachers and students went to the fields together to learn farming techniques from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They learn what the countryside needs and use what they learn, linking theory with practice. A junior high school graduate from a public school returned to the production team but couldn't plow or hoe the land, and as an accountant, made mistakes and lost money. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and felt pain in their hearts, saying, "The knowledge learned is useless, wearing a pen but can't do accounts."

(6) The teachers of the brigade-run schools are thrifty and self-reliant in running the schools, solving difficulties on their own. Public schools, on the other hand, rely on state funding every year, and when they encounter difficulties, they ask the state for help, which does not conform to the spirit of thrift.

After comparing the two, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade decided, based on the convenience of managing the schools according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, to convert all public primary schools within the brigade into brigade-run schools in September of this year.

After converting public schools into brigade-run schools, it has greatly promoted the thought reform of the teachers. In the past, there was a public school teacher in this brigade who had long been demanding a transfer and a change of position, teaching for only ten or fifteen minutes and then leaving the students to do their own thing. After the reform, this teacher went to the poor and lower-middle peasants for re-education, participated in labor, and was influenced by the proletarian feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants, changing his thoughts and feelings. He said, "Only by participating in labor and being closely connected with the poor and lower-middle peasants can Mao Zedong Thought take root in one's mind." Some public school teachers used to think they had "knowledge" and were cadres, so their status and treatment were slightly higher than that of the commune members. Therefore, they always put on airs and never got along with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through this reform and the re-education of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, they realized that they had been poisoned by the revisionist thoughts of the number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, advocating "those who labor with their brains rule others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others." They expressed their willingness to follow Chairman Mao's great instructions, actively participate in labor, think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

　　遵照毛主席的教导对旧的教育体制进行重大改革
　　平安大队贫下中农把公办小学改为由大队来办
    贫下中农从切身体会中总结了队办小学和队办小学的教师有六大好处：（一）用毛泽东思想教育学生；（二）最关心贫下中农子女；（三）最关心农村的三大革命运动；（四）把贫下中农的本色带进了学校；（五）教学密切联系实际；（六）艰苦创业、勤俭办学
    新华社哈尔滨十五日电　黑龙江省庆安县平安公社平安大队的贫下中农，遵照毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的教导，对旧的教育体制进行了重大改革：把公办小学改为队办，教师在队里是教员又是社员，不拿国家的工资，记工分参加生产队的分配。这项重大改革，使农村教育大权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里，同时也有效地促进了教师的思想革命化。
    这个大队的贫下中农是经过对比才决定把公办小学一律改为队办的。这个大队原先共有公办、队办小学五所。贫下中农目睹身受，深深感到：由旧县文教局领导的公办小学，在大队里是个“独立王国”，他们不听贫下中农按照毛泽东思想提出的意见，不按贫下中农的心愿办学；而队办小学就根据贫下中农的意见，按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线办事。公办和队办小学的教师，在表现上也截然不同。十二名公办小学的教师都由国家发工资，因此，他们脱离劳动，思想感情与贫下中农格格不入；而五名队办小学教师，都是群众从贫下中农中挑选出来的，他们不拿国家工资，参加队里的分配，因此，他们积极参加劳动，与贫下中农心心相印。贫下中农从切身体会中给队办小学和队办小学的教师总结了六大好处：
    （一）由贫下中农管理的队办小学，按照贫下中农的意愿，用毛泽东思想教育学生。来自贫下中农的队办小学教师，对毛主席有深厚的无产阶级感情，他们最听毛主席的话，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。队办小学教师，给学生讲的第一堂课是《为人民服务》，教学生第一次写的字是“毛主席万岁”。队办小学教师经常请老贫农给学生忆苦思甜，上阶级教育课。当别人问一位队办小学教师教的一个九岁的学生为啥念书时，学生马上回答说：“为人民服务！”可是公办小学教师教的一个二年级学生的回答却是：“长大进城当干部”。
      （二）队办小学是生产队的一个组成部分，队办小学教师和贫下中农心连心，最关心贫下中农子女。队办小学教师允许学生带弟弟妹妹上学，家务活多的学生不能到校上课，教师还主动到家去教。平安二队有两个儿童给生产队放猪，队办小学教师一面鼓励他们为集体放好猪，一面用早、午、晚的时间单独给他们上课。现在这两个孩子已经插班上了四年级。
      （三）小学由队办，教师在队里是教员又是社员，最关心农村阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。贫下中农说他们“能上能下，能文能武，是生产队的好参谋，社员的好帮手”。他们除了教课外，又是生产队的毛泽东思想宣传员，学习班的辅导员，和社员一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起讨论生产队的生产和工作。这些人有的还担任了大队民兵副连长、革委会委员。有些公办小学教师却整天蹲在学校的小天地里，和贫下中农不来往，对生产队的事情不过问。贫下中农不满地说：“公办小学教师是‘海外天子’，和咱们想不到一块，说不到一块，做不到一块。”
      （四）队办小学教师来自贫下中农，他们把贫下中农的本色带进了学校，传给了学生。他们既教书又种田，早上和社员一块劳动，然后再回去上课，放学后又到生产队找活干。他们这种朴朴实实的作风给学生以很好的影响。
      （五）队办小学教师教学，是按照贫下中农的意见，从农村三大革命运动的需要出发，密切联系实际，不象公办小学教师那样整天死啃书本，追求分数。二队民办小学从一九六四年办学以来，把开设毛主席著作和阶级教育课摆在第一位，同时根据农村需要设置了“社会主义集体经济常识”、“庄农杂字”等课程，教师和学生一起到田间，向贫下中农学习生产技术。农村需要啥学啥，学了就用，理论联系实际。公办学校毕业的一个初中生回到生产队后，犁不会扶，地不会铲，当个出纳员差账又丢款。贫下中农看在眼里，痛在心上，说：“学的东西用不上，挂着钢笔不会算账”。
      （六）队办小学教师艰苦创业、勤俭办学，有困难靠自力更生自己解决。公办小学每年要国家拨经费，遇到困难，向国家伸手，不符合勤俭办学的精神。
    这个大队的贫下中农经过对比，从便于自己按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线管理学校出发，在今年九月把大队范围内的公办小学一律改成了队办。
    公办小学改为队办后，对教师的思想革命化有很大促进作用。这个大队过去有一个公办小学教师，长期闹地位，挑地点，今天要求调转，明天要求改行，上课讲十几分钟，就丢下学生不管，干自己的活。经过改革，这位教师到贫下中农中接受再教育，参加了生产劳动，受到贫下中农的无产阶级感情的熏陶，思想感情发生了变化。他说，只有参加劳动，同贫下中农息息相关，毛泽东思想才能在头脑中扎根。有的公办小学教师，过去认为自己“有知识”，是干部，比社员地位高些，待遇高些是理所当然。因此，总是放不下架子，和贫下中农总也合不来。通过这次改革，经过广大贫下中农的再教育，他们认识到这是中了党内头号走资派刘少奇“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的修正主义思想的毒害，表示要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，积极参加劳动，想贫下中农所想，为贫下中农服务，走与工农相结合的道路。
