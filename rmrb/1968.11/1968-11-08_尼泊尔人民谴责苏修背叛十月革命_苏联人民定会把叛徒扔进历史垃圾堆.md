Nepalese friends have recently been denouncing the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the October Socialist Revolution and enthusiastically praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

A friend living in Patan City wrote in a letter: "Fifty-one years ago, under the leadership of the great proletarian revolutionary leader Lenin, the Russian proletariat succeeded in its revolution. The red flag of Marxism-Leninism flew over the land of the Soviet Union.

"Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union eliminated the decaying, reactionary bourgeois regime and established proletarian dictatorship.

"But today, this socialist state, once led by Lenin and Stalin, has been turned by the traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others into a center of counter-revolutionary revisionism and reaction. These traitors, under the guise of the 'party of the whole people,' have turned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a bourgeois party. Under the pretext of the 'state of the whole people,' they have turned proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. These traitors have thus realized the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

"They have, under the pretext of 'peaceful coexistence,' formed a 'holy alliance' with the enemy of the Vietnamese people and all oppressed and exploited peoples of the world, American imperialism, and have turned their hostility towards socialist countries like China and Albania."

The friend quoted Chairman Mao's words in the letter: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist state, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has now been usurped by the revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long."

The friend enthusiastically praised the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the letter. He wrote: "Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the people in countries ruled by revisionism, they will be able to rely on their own strength to overthrow the counter-revolutionary rule of revisionism, seize back political power, and return their country to the socialist road of proletarian dictatorship."

The friend also expressed his determination to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

A friend in Kathmandu wrote in a letter: "Looking back at the time of Lenin and Stalin, how proud the Soviet proletariat was! But today, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others have changed the color of the Soviet regime, turning the former red fortress of the Soviet Union into the center of modern revisionism."

The friend said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "The road of the October Revolution, fundamentally speaking, is the common bright road for the development of all mankind." He went on to say, "Today, under the brilliant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the flames of revolution are burning all over the world."

The friend said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is achieving comprehensive victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up a path to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. The Chinese people have already overthrown the Khrushchev of China, and the Soviet people will one day throw Khrushchev and his followers like Brezhnev and Kosygin into the dustbin of history.

A young student wrote in a letter: "The great People's Republic of China, under proletarian dictatorship, stands like a giant in the East. Under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the 700 million Chinese people are carrying out the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are about to achieve comprehensive victory. This is a revolution of great significance, which has a great impact on the future of China and the destiny of mankind. Through this cultural revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been further deeply rooted in the hearts of the working people."

The friend expressed his wish for Chairman Mao to live forever and for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve thorough victory.

    尼泊尔人民谴责苏修背叛十月革命
    苏联人民定会把叛徒扔进历史垃圾堆
    据新华社六日讯　尼泊尔朋友最近纷纷谴责苏修叛徒集团背叛十月社会主义革命，热情歌颂中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位住帕坦市的朋友在一封信中说：“五十一年前，在伟大的无产阶级革命领袖列宁的领导下，苏联的无产阶级所进行的革命成功了。马克思列宁主义的红旗在苏联的土地上飘扬。
    “在列宁、斯大林的领导下，苏联消灭了腐朽的反动的资产阶级的政权，建立了无产阶级专政。
    “但是，今天，这个被列宁、斯大林领导过的社会主义国家，却被赫鲁晓夫和他的门徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金等叛徒们变成为反革命修正主义和反动派的中心。这些叛徒们，用‘全民党’的名义，把苏联共产党变为资产阶级的政党，在‘全民国家’的幌子下，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些叛徒们就是这样在苏联实现了资本主义复辟。
    “他们在‘和平共处’的幌子下，同越南人民和全世界被压迫被剥削人民的敌人美帝国主义结成‘神圣同盟’，敌视中国和阿尔巴尼亚那样的社会主义国家。”
    这位朋友在信中引用了毛主席的一段话：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”
    这位朋友在信中热情歌颂了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他写道：“毛泽东思想一旦被修正主义统治的国家里的人民所掌握，他们就能够依靠自己的力量，推翻修正主义的反革命统治，把政权夺回到自己的手里，使他们的祖国重新回到无产阶级专政的社会主义道路上去。”
    这位朋友在信中还表示要努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    一位加德满都的朋友在一封信里说：“回想在列宁、斯大林时期，苏联无产阶级是多么值得骄傲！可是今天，赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金等改变了苏维埃政权的颜色，把当日的红色堡垒苏联变成了现代修正主义的中心。”
    这位朋友说：毛泽东主席教导我们说：“十月革命的道路，从根本上说来，是全人类发展的共同的光明大道。”他接着说，“今天，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，革命的烈火正在全世界燃烧。”
    这位朋友说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在夺取全面胜利。中国无产阶级文化大革命开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的道路。中国人民已经打倒了中国的赫鲁晓夫，苏联人民也总有一天要把赫鲁晓夫和他的门徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流扔进历史的垃圾堆。
    一位青年学生在信里说：“无产阶级专政的伟大的中华人民共和国，象一个巨人屹立在东方。在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下的七亿中国人民，正在进行历史上首创的无产阶级文化大革命，并即将取得全面胜利。这是一场具有重大意义的革命，它对中国的前途和人类的命运，具有重大影响。通过这场文化大革命，毛泽东思想更进一步地深入劳动人民的心灵。”
    这位朋友在信中表示敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！祝中国无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利！
