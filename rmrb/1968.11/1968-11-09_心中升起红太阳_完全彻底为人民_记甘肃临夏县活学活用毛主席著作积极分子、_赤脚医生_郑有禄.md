In Gansu Province's Linxia County, Red Star Commune, there is a "barefoot doctor" named Zheng Youlu who is deeply loved by the masses. This former cowherd from the old society, an illiterate peasant's descendant, studied for only fifteen days at the commune's health worker training class. However, relying on his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as taught by the great leader Chairman Mao, and relying on his deep proletarian feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, he has cured many difficult and serious illnesses for the poor and lower-middle peasants over the past few years, becoming their trusted friend. The local poor and lower-middle peasants say, "We cannot do without Little Zheng." This is the high evaluation of his work by the people.

Thirty-year-old Zheng Youlu has been working at the commune health center since 1963. To treat the illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he has braved wind and rain, day and night, crossed mountains and valleys, and visited every household in the entire commune. Many patients from outside the commune also come to seek this "barefoot doctor" who wholeheartedly serves the poor and lower-middle peasants. From 1965 to the present, he has treated 2,864 people from six communes and has gone to six other communes to treat over 600 patients. The commune health center initially had only Zheng Youlu, and now it has only three people. The equipment is simple, and there is a shortage of doctors and medicine, but over the past few years, they have cured over 800 patients with various serious illnesses.

Heart Thinking of Chairman Mao, Unobstructed on the Revolutionary Path

In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Zheng Youlu received a notice: the Party sent him to the commune health worker training class to study. This was something he had never dreamed of. He thought, in the old society, his entire family, generation after generation, had never entered a school door, and he himself was illiterate. Now the Party is sending me to study medicine. I must overcome all difficulties, study hard, and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants well to repay Chairman Mao's kindness. Thus, as soon as he entered the training class, he studied and memorized with all his might. Not knowing how to read, he used the slogans on the wall as textbooks to learn characters and used crayons to mark and learn the names of medicines. After fifteen days of study, he was assigned to the Linxia County Biezang District Health Hospital as a health worker. There, he did everything from cooking, sweeping, washing clothes, fetching water, and boiling needles. However, those untransformed bourgeois intellectuals who worked as doctors in the hospital discriminated against him, calling him "not suitable for studying medicine," and so on. He fought resolutely against these bourgeois intellectuals. He thought, letting the poor and lower-middle peasants study medicine is the great leader Chairman Mao's trust in us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. He brought out the poor and lower-middle peasants' tenacious revolutionary spirit, studied hard, and worked actively. Finally, through practical work and the help of comrades, he gradually overcame the numerous difficulties in identifying medicines, diagnosing, acupuncture, and performing surgeries.

In 1960, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agent in Linxia County vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, severely cutting back on rural medical and health services, and many health workers were forced to return home. At that time, someone said to Zheng Youlu, "You can't even earn a penny of sugar, being a health worker is not as good as going home to raise a few chickens." Zheng Youlu thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people" and of many class brothers who could not go to the city for treatment. He firmly replied, "I cannot forget Chairman Mao's kindness, and my resolve to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot change. I will definitely continue."

In 1965, a patient with an abscess in the liver for over a year came to the commune health center requesting surgery. At that time, a doctor who had just graduated from a medical university in another province was passing through. After examining the patient, the doctor said, "Your condition is serious, and there are no facilities here for treatment. I will refer you to another place." However, the poor and lower-middle peasants did not have the money to go to big hospitals in the city, and the patient urgently requested that the local "barefoot doctor" see him. However, when Zheng Youlu was about to go over, he unexpectedly offended the doctor's dignity. The doctor angrily said, "Can such a health center treat such a disease? On what basis do you perform surgery? Who will take responsibility if something goes wrong!" With that, he left in a huff. Zheng Youlu did not pay any attention to this. He reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings of "learning from war" and "practicing is learning." He decided to cure this class brother's illness. Without an operating room, he used his own room as the operating room. Without a surgical knife, he found another knife to use. With the spirit of "extreme responsibility to work," he successfully completed the surgery. In less than a month, he cured this poor and lower-middle peasant's serious illness. Subsequently, the deep muscle abscesses of Marugaya from Red Star Team 1 and Mafatuma from Xiaogou Team 8 were also successfully operated on and cured by the "barefoot doctor" Zheng Youlu in this small health center with poor facilities, which was deemed by doctors from big hospitals in other provinces as having no conditions for treatment.

Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, Wholeheartedly Serving the People

Zheng Youlu loves the great leader Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. The first characters he learned to recognize were "Long Live Chairman Mao," and the first work of Chairman Mao he studied was the brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles." He often thinks, without Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation for all the laboring people under heaven, and there would be no Zheng Youlu. Chairman Mao saved me from the fire pit, and I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

In his work at the health center, he saves every penny for the people. Once, the leadership asked Zheng Youlu to go to Linxia City to get medicine, and gave him 1.5 yuan for travel expenses. From his workplace to Linxia City, it is over a hundred li round trip, and he walked the entire way. On his way back, he carried forty or fifty jin of medicine. Halfway, it got dark, and he was tired and hungry. He spent the night under the eaves of a roadside tea shop. The next day, he returned and handed back the travel expenses in full to the public. He said, "Carrying medicine is also serving the people, and I don't want to spend this money." Over the years, whenever they got medicine from the city, it was he and other comrades who carried it back.

Zheng Youlu actively studies and applies the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." He treats the illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants as his own, and their difficulties as his own. He sees patients regardless of whether it is working hours or not; the time the poor and lower-middle peasants come to see a doctor is his working time. Day or night, no matter how high the mountains or deep the valleys, as long as he hears that the poor and lower-middle peasants have an emergency, he puts on his medicine box and goes. He is not afraid of hard work, not afraid of suffering, not afraid of dirt, not afraid of death, and wholeheartedly serves his class brothers. Once, three children with toxic dysentery suddenly came to the health center. One child's temperature had risen to 40 degrees, and his pupils were dilated. The family members were crying in desperation. Zheng Youlu gave the patients injections and told them to go home, fearing danger; he told them to stay, but there were only three patients, plus the family members who brought the patients. What to do? He remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "extreme responsibility to work" and "extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people," and had the three patients stay on his kang. He gave the three patients intravenous drips, injections, and medicine day and night, acting as both a doctor and a nurse. The family members were afraid of dirtying his bedding and rolled it up. Zheng Youlu said, "This is the bed Chairman Mao gave me, and it should serve the patients." He personally covered his own quilt over the patients. He took care of them continuously for three days and nights, and the three patients were out of danger. He then sent them back home one by one. In this way, his kang is often given to patients, even those with infectious diseases. Injections and medicine are expensive, while acupuncture costs little or nothing and has good effects, and the masses welcome it the most. Zheng Youlu started learning acupuncture in 1965. He was afraid that his skills were not good enough and that the patients would suffer, so he first experimented on himself until he mastered the acupuncture technique before starting to treat patients. In the Hejia Production Team of Pucha Commune, there was a 58-year-old old poor peasant who suffered from rheumatoid arthritis all over his body and could not straighten his waist. Zheng Youlu gave this old poor peasant continuous acupuncture for a period, and cured his illness. The old poor peasant gratefully said, "In the old society, I carried a long-term laborer for a lifetime, and when I was sick, I was not as good as a dog. Today, I got this illness, and it was cured without spending a penny. This is the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Since 1965, Zheng Youlu has performed acupuncture on over 3,200 people, curing many people's illnesses, and is deeply loved by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

One evening, Zheng Youlu had just finished seeing a patient and returned to the health center when people told him that a commune member on Xishan had acute gastritis and asked him to go and see. He heard this and quickly put on his medicine box and rushed out. When he closed the door forcefully, a brick fell from the door and knocked him unconscious. It was not until two commune members helped him up that he knew his head was injured and blood was flowing down his neck. He asked the commune members to cut his hair and bandaged his head himself, but his head was still painful and dizzy. He was afraid he could not go, so he sat down to rest. At this time, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and was greatly inspired. He immediately stood up and went to Xishan. He was afraid of fainting alone on the mountain and causing trouble, so he asked a commune member to accompany him. When he was seeing the patient, the patient saw Zheng Youlu's condition and was surprised, saying, "Your condition is worse than mine!" and insisted on keeping him. However, Zheng Youlu considered that there was no one in the health center, fearing that it would delay the treatment of other patients, and rushed back.

Once, Zheng Youlu went to treat the old poor peasant Qin Yun in Machangwan. Qin Yun suffered from tuberculosis of the lymph nodes all over his body, with pus and blood oozing out, and had been bedridden for four whole years. Zheng Youlu saw the patient's condition and was afraid he could not cure it, comforted the old poor peasant a few words, and left. Halfway, he opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and saw that Chairman Mao said, "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade." He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on the way. Back in the health center, he could not sleep at night, always feeling that he had not treated the old poor peasant according to Chairman Mao's teachings that day. Zheng Youlu thought about it all night, and the next day he went back to the old poor peasant's house. He said to the old poor peasant, "I must cure your illness, and if I cannot, I will be ungrateful to Chairman Mao." From then on, no matter how busy he was, he insisted on going to see this old poor peasant every day. If there was no time during the day, he would go at night in the dark. One night, Zheng Youlu was halfway when it started raining heavily, with lightning and thunder, pouring down on his head. It was so dark that he could not see five fingers in front of him, and the accumulated water on the road had become a river. Zheng Youlu could not see the road in the muddy water, so he ran a section whenever the lightning lit up. He ran to the patient's house in this way. Zheng Youlu treated the old poor peasant over seventy times, and the old poor peasant Qin Yun, who had been bedridden for four whole years, finally could move again. He held Zheng Youlu's hand and said, "I have no son, but you are closer to me than my son." The old poor peasant said to the portrait of Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You have given me a second life."

Zheng Youlu treats the illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants with all his heart. Since 1967, he has encountered several children with cystitis, with serious conditions, and long-term inability to urinate, with the danger of urinary poisoning. The catheter was too thick for the children to use, and he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, so he used his mouth to suck out the pus and blood from the children's urethras. Several children were saved in this way. Commune member Yang Fulin's five-year-old son had intestinal obstruction, and when he was brought to the health center, the child was already unconscious. Due to not defecating for several days, the child's stomach was swollen like a small pot with a lid. His parents were crying in desperation. The commune members present said, "The child's pulse is gone, the county hospital cannot be reached, quickly take him back." At this time, Zheng Youlu felt as if a thousand-pound stone was pressing on his body. He looked up and saw the portrait of Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessly serving others" flashed in his mind. He saw the child having difficulty breathing, so he breathed into the child's mouth for a while, then found a piece of rubber tube and inserted it into the child's anus, sucking and gently massaging the child's stomach at the same time. Suddenly, a foul smell came, and the feces were sucked out. He felt the child's stomach soften, and the condition improved, immediately transferring the patient to the county hospital. After the child recovered, the child's father, Yang Fulin, gratefully said, "It was Chairman Mao who gave this child a second life, and I will forever be grateful to Chairman Mao, the savior."

Being a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, a fighter in the class struggle

Zheng Youlu is not only a health worker for the people but also a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought and a fighter in the class struggle. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he always carries the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him whenever he goes out to see patients. Wherever he goes to see patients, he propagates Mao Zedong Thought there, studies Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the patients, conducts bitter-sweet remembrance together, and engages in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

Zheng Youlu follows Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and always remembers class struggle, bravely fighting against various class enemies and all the old ideas and habits of the exploiting class. In the health center, he fought face-to-face with a class enemy who had infiltrated. This June, when he was seeing patients in the Pioneer Team 4, he learned that there was a bad person spreading rumors everywhere and preparing to assassinate the brigade cadres. He immediately reported this to the commune revolutionary committee. When he was seeing patients in the Peace Team 1, he discovered that a class enemy who had been exposed was trying to feign illness to avoid the struggle of the revolutionary masses. Zheng Youlu exposed this person's plot on the spot. In recent years, some people with serious superstitions did not call a doctor when they were sick but insisted on having a witch doctor chant. Zheng Youlu adopted a countermeasure: wherever those people chanted, he went to that village to see patients, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought and scientific principles to educate the masses. Later, the masses hated the witch doctors and no longer went to them for treatment.

On the west side of the health center, there is a 16-year-old girl named Ma Nai Bai, an orphan, who has tuberculosis. Her aunt had serious superstitions and never called a doctor for treatment, performing witchcraft for half a year. The girl's condition worsened, becoming emaciated, with skin and bones showing, lips unable to cover her teeth, and almost all her hair falling out. Many commune members said that the girl would not survive. Zheng Youlu resolutely fought against superstitions and decided to save the girl. He was not afraid of the high mountains and long distances, nor was he deterred by wind and rain. He and a colleague from the health center took turns seeing patients, going once a day. If the condition worsened, they went twice a day. Indeed, the girl's condition improved day by day. After more than three months of patient treatment, she was finally cured. The girl was very grateful to Zheng Youlu. Zheng Youlu said, "This is what Chairman Mao told me to do, thank Chairman Mao." The girl gratefully said, "If it were not for Chairman Mao, witchcraft would have killed me long ago. I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works and work hard to repay Chairman Mao's kindness."

Recently, Zheng Youlu, reflecting on his work over the past few years, said that he could do some work for the people entirely because of the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, I am just a beginner on the road of revolutionization, and compared to Chairman Mao's requirements for us revolutionary health workers, I am still far behind; compared to the good cadres like Men He, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, there is still a big gap. My abilities are limited, but serving the people is limitless. In the future, I will be like Comrade Men He, thinking of everything for Chairman Mao, submitting to everything for Chairman Mao, following everything for Chairman Mao, and fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive, and sacrificing for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead.

    心中升起红太阳　完全彻底为人民
    ——记甘肃临夏县活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、“赤脚医生”郑有禄
    甘肃省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队临夏分队
    在甘肃省临夏县红星公社，有一个深受群众爱戴的“赤脚医生”——郑有禄。这个旧社会的放牛娃、一字不识的贫农后代，只在公社保健员训练班学习过十五天，但是，他凭着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，凭着伟大领袖毛主席教导的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，凭着对贫下中农深厚的无产阶级感情，几年来为贫下中农治好了不少疑难重病，成了当地贫下中农的贴心人。当地的贫下中农说：“我们离不开小郑”。这就是人们对他的工作的崇高评价。
    三十岁的郑有禄，从一九六三年调到公社卫生所以来，为了给贫下中农治病，不管刮风下雨，白天黑夜，翻山越岭，跑遍了全公社贫下中农的各家各户。有不少外公社的病人，也跑来找这位一心为着贫下中农的“赤脚医生”。从一九六五年到现在，他先后为六个公社的二千八百六十四人看过病，到外公社为六百多名病人出诊过。这个公社的卫生所，最初只有郑有禄一个人，现在也只有三个人，设备简陋，缺医少药，但几年来，已经治好了各种重病号八百多人。
    心里想着毛主席　革命路上无阻挡
    在大跃进的一九五八年，郑有禄接到一个通知：党送他到公社保健员训练班去学习。这真是他做梦也没有想到过的事。他想到，在旧社会，全家祖祖辈辈没有进过学校门，自己也是一个大字不识，现在党要送我去学医了，我一定要克服一切困难，好好学习，好好为咱贫下中农服务，来报答毛主席的恩情。于是，一进训练班，他就拚命学，拚命记，不识字，他用墙上的标语当课本学认字，用蜡笔打记号学认药名。学了十五天，他被分配到临夏县别藏地区卫生院当保健员。在那里，做饭、扫地、洗衣、打水、煮针，什么杂事他都干。可是，在院里当大夫的那些没有改造好的资产阶级知识分子却歧视他，骂他是“不是学医的材料”，等等。他向这些资产阶级知识分子进行了坚决的斗争。他想，让贫下中农学医，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们贫下中农的信任，毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要给毛主席争气。他拿出了贫下中农顽强的革命精神，努力学习，积极工作。终于，他通过实际工作的锻炼和同志们的帮助，逐步战胜了识药、诊断、针灸和动手术中的重重困难。
    在一九六○年，大叛徒刘少奇和他在临夏县的代理人，极力推行反革命修正主义路线，大砍农村的医疗卫生事业，许多保健员被迫回了家。这时有人对郑有禄说：“你一个糖萝卜钱也挣不下，当个保健员还不如回家喂上一窝鸡”。郑有禄想着毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，想着许多无法进城治病的阶级兄弟，坚定地回答说：“毛主席的恩情不能忘，为贫下中农服务的决心不能变，我要坚决地干下去。”
    在一九六五年，有个患肝部部位脓肿已经一年多的病人，来公社卫生所要求动手术。这时正好有个外地医科大学毕业的医生，出差来这里。这个医生看后对病人说：“你的病情很重，这里没有条件治，把你介绍到外地去看。”但是，贫下中农那有那么多的钱到外面大医院去看病，病人焦急地要求本地的“赤脚医生”看看。可是，当郑有禄刚要过去看时，没想到触犯了那位医生的尊严，他对郑有禄大发脾气，说什么“你这样的卫生所，能看这样的病吗？你凭什么条件动手术？出了问题你负责任！”说罢就扬长而去。郑有禄没有理睬这一套，他重温了毛主席“从战争学习战争”、“干就是学习”的教导，决心要把这位阶级兄弟的病治好。没有手术室，他把自己的住房当手术室，没有手术刀，他找别的刀代用，他以“对工作的极端的负责任”的精神，终于顺利地完成了手术，不到一个月的时间就把这位贫下中农的重病治好了。接着，红星一队的马鲁给亚、小沟八队的马法图玛患的深部肌肉化脓组织炎，也都由“赤脚医生”郑有禄在这个设备简陋、被外地大医院来的医生认为没有条件的小小卫生所里给动手术治好了。
    永远忠于毛主席　全心全意为人民服务
    郑有禄从心眼里无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他第一次认的字是“毛主席万岁”五个大字，第一次学习的毛主席著作是光辉的“老三篇”。他常想，没有毛主席，就没有普天下劳动人民的解放，也没有我郑有禄。毛主席把我从火坑里救出来，我要永远忠于毛主席，“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务。
    在卫生所的工作中，只要能为人民节约一分钱，他就节约一分钱。有一次，领导上要郑有禄到临夏市取药，临走时给他一元五角钱的路费。从他工作的卫生所到临夏市，来回一百多里，他来回都是步行。回来的时候，背了四、五十斤重的药品，走到半路天黑了，又乏又饿，他就在路旁茶铺的房檐底下过了一夜，第二天回来，把发给他的路费原数退给了公家。他说：“背药也是为人民服务，我不愿意花这个钱”。几年来，他们卫生所从城里领药，都是他和其他同志背回来的。
    郑有禄活学活用“老三篇”，为人民服务做到了“完全”“彻底”。他把贫下中农的病当成自己的病，把贫下中农的困难当成自己的困难。他看病不分上班时间或下班时间，贫下中农看病的时间，就是他上班的时间。不论白天黑夜，任凭山大沟深，只要听说贫下中农有急病，他背上药箱就走。他不怕累，不怕苦，不怕脏，不怕死，全心全意为阶级兄弟服务。有一次，卫生所一下来了三个患中毒性痢疾的小孩子，其中一个小孩体温已经烧到四十一度，瞳孔散大，家属急得直哭。郑有禄给病人打了针后，叫他们回去吧，怕有危险；叫他们住下吧，光病人就是三个，还有带病人来的家属。怎么办呢？他想起了毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，就叫三个病人都在他的炕上住下。他白天黑夜给三个病人轮流输液、打针、吃药，又当医生，又当护士。病人家属害怕把他的被褥弄脏，就卷起来。郑有禄说：“这是毛主席给我的被，要让它为病人服务。”他又亲手把自己的被子盖在病人身上。他连续护理了三昼夜，三个病人脱险了，他又一个一个地把病人送回家里。就这样，他的炕经常让给病人甚至传染病人住。打针吃药花钱多，针灸少花钱或不花钱，效果好，群众最欢迎。郑有禄就从一九六五年开始学针灸。他怕自己的功夫不到家，病人受痛，就在自己身上先试验，直到掌握了针灸技术，才开始给病人针灸。铺川公社何家生产队，有一个五十八岁的老贫农，患全身风湿性关节炎，腰展不开，郑有禄给这个老贫农连续针灸了一段时间，把他的病治好了。这个老贫农感激地说：“我在旧社会扛了一辈子长工，病了不如一条狗，今天得了这个病，一角钱不花治好了，这是共产党毛主席的恩情！”一九六五年以来，郑有禄一共针灸三千二百多人次，治好了很多人的病，深受贫下中农的欢迎。
    有一天晚上，郑有禄刚看完病回到卫生所，人们就告诉他西山上一个社员患急性胃炎，叫他快去看看。他一听，赶忙把保健箱一背，就急急忙忙往外走。出门时使劲一关门，门上一块砖掉下来，把他打昏了。直到两个社员把他扶起来时，他才知道头被打破了，血流了一脖子。他叫社员替他剪掉头发，自己用纱布包好，但头又痛又晕，他怕去不成了，就坐下来休息。这时，他想起了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，受到巨大的鼓舞，立即站起来向西山上走去。他怕自己一个人晕倒在山上误事，就请一个社员陪他去。当他给病人看病时，病人一看郑有禄那个样子，吃惊地说：“你的病比我还重啊！”硬要留他住下。可是郑有禄考虑到卫生所里没人，怕误了给其他病人看病，就又赶了回来。
    有次，郑有禄去替马场弯的老贫农秦云看病。秦云患全身淋巴结核，浑身脓血噗哧噗哧的，整整四年不能起床。郑有禄一见病人的样子，怕看不好，安慰了老贫农几句就走了。走到半路上，他打开了《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”他一路想着毛主席的教导。回到卫生所里，晚上睡不着，他总觉得今天给老贫农看病，没有按照毛主席的教导去做。郑有禄想了一夜，第二天他又来到了那位老贫农家里，对老贫农说：“你的病我一定要给你看好，看不好，我就对不起毛主席。”从此，他不论多忙，每天都坚持去给这位老贫农看病。白天没有时间，晚上摸黑也要去。有天晚上，郑有禄走到半路上，下起了大雨，又是闪电，又是打雷，倾盆大雨直往他头上泼，天黑得伸手不见五指，路上的积水成了河。郑有禄在泥水中看不清路，就乘闪电亮一下，跑一节。就这么一节一节跑到了病人家里。郑有禄给老贫农一连看了七十多次，整整躺了四年的老贫农秦云，终于能行动了。他抓住郑有禄的手说：“我没有儿子，可是你比我儿子还亲。”老贫农对着毛主席像又说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您给了我第二次生命。”
    郑有禄为贫下中农治病，一颗心全在病人身上。一九六七年以来，他先后遇到好几个得膀胱炎的小孩，病情很重，长时间尿不出尿，有发生尿中毒的危险。导尿管太粗，小孩不能用，他想到毛主席教导的要“完全”“彻底”为人民，就用嘴把孩子尿道里的脓血吸出来。几个小孩都这么救过来了。社员杨富林的一个五岁的男孩得了肠梗阻病，抱到卫生所时，娃娃已经昏迷不醒。由于几天没拉大便，娃娃肚子鼓得象扣着口小锅。他父母亲急得直哭。当时在场的社员说：“娃娃脉都没了，县医院送不到了，快抱回去吧。”郑有禄这时候的身上好象压了一块千斤石。他抬头看见毛主席像，毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导在他脑子里闪了出来。他看娃娃呼吸困难，就嘴对嘴地呼吸了一阵，随后找了一节橡皮管，插到娃娃肛门里，一面用嘴吸，一面轻轻地揉压娃娃的肚子。突然一股臭气扑来，稀屎被吸了出来。他一摸孩子肚子软了，病情有了好转，立即就把病人转送到县医院。娃娃病好以后，孩子的父亲杨富林感激地说：“这是毛主席给了这娃儿第二次生命，我要永远感谢救命恩人毛主席。”做毛泽东思想的宣传员，当阶级斗争的战斗员
    郑有禄既是人民的卫生员，又是毛泽东思想的宣传员，也是阶级斗争的战斗员。文化大革命开始后，他每次出诊，总要摸一摸口袋里有没有带《毛主席语录》。他到那里去看病，就在那里宣传毛泽东思想，和病人一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起进行忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修。
    郑有禄遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，勇敢地同形形色色的阶级敌人作斗争，同剥削阶级的一切旧思想、旧习惯势力作斗争。在卫生所里，他对一个混进所里的阶级敌人，展开了面对面的斗争。今年六月份，他在先锋四队看病，了解到有一个坏人到处制造谣言，还准备谋杀大队干部的罪行后，就立即向公社革委会作了汇报。他在和平一队看病时，发现已被揪出的一个阶级敌人，企图装病，逃避革命群众的斗争，郑有禄就当面戳破了这个家伙的阴谋。前几年，有些迷信思想严重的群众，有病不叫医生看，偏叫巫神念经，郑有禄就采取了个针锋相对的办法：那些家伙在那个村念经，他就到那个村出诊，去宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想和科学道理教育了群众。后来，群众恨透了巫神，再不找他们看病了。
    卫生所西面山上有个十六岁的姑娘马乃白，是个孤儿，得了肺结核病。她姨娘迷信思想很严重，从来不请医生看病，抓鬼弄神地搞了半年，这姑娘的病越来越厉害，面黄肌瘦，皮包骨头，嘴皮都包不住牙齿，头发也差不多脱光了。很多社员说，这个姑娘活不了啦。郑有禄坚决和迷信思想进行斗争，下决心要把这个姑娘救过来。山高路远他不怕，刮风下雨无阻挡，他和所里的一个同志轮流出诊，每天跑一趟，病情稍有恶化，一天就去两趟。果然，姑娘的病一天比一天好转。经过三个多月的耐心治疗，终于把这个姑娘治好了。这个姑娘非常感谢郑有禄。郑有禄说：“这是毛主席叫我这样做的，你感谢毛主席吧。”姑娘感激地说：“要不是毛主席，抓鬼弄神早把我害死了，我一定要好好学习毛主席著作，好好劳动生产，报答毛主席的恩情。”
    最近，郑有禄在回顾他这几年的工作时说，他能为人民做点工作，完全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。他说，我在革命化的大路上才是一个学着走路的人，比起毛主席对我们革命卫生工作者的要求，还差得很远；比起无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志，还存在着很大的差距，我的能力是有限的，但为人民服务是无限的。今后我要象门合同志那样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。
