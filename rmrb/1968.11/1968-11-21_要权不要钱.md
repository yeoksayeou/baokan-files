We Want Power, Not Money

Publicly-run primary schools save us poor and lower-middle peasants some money, but we have no say in education; primary schools run by the production brigade cost us some money, but we have the power. We want "power," not "money"! Because having power over education means we can manage the schools well. This, we poor and lower-middle peasants understand best. Take the teachers, for example. In the past, the state paid their salaries, and they had "iron rice bowls." If they taught poorly, we had no say, and even if we had complaints, at most, higher authorities would transfer them. Teachers would say, "If this place doesn't keep me, another will." Now, with primary schools run by the production brigade, teachers are accounted for by the brigade, and they are just ordinary members. We know their backgrounds, temperaments, and performance, making it easier for us to educate them. If they are truly unfit to be people's teachers, we have the power to adjust and select people we trust to educate our children. This way, we can ensure that the school's educational direction and cultivation goals are correct. Therefore, we poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly support the transfer of publicly-run primary schools to the production brigades.

We poor and lower-middle peasants have hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, a history of suffering in the old society, and a hardworking and simple style. These are the guarantees for running rural primary schools well. "Our goal must be achieved. Our goal can be achieved."

Sun Hongxi, Member of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Assembly, Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province

    要权不要钱
    小学公办，我们贫下中农省几个钱，但是没有文权；小学大队办，我们贫下中农花几个钱，但是有了文权。我们要“权”不要“钱”！因为有了文权就能把学校管好。这一点，我们贫下中农体会最深。拿教师来说，过去国家发工资，他有了“铁饭碗”，教不好，我们贫下中农也管不着，意见再大，顶多由上级给调调地方。教师说：“此处不养爷，还有养爷处。”小学由大队办，教师由本大队记工分，本身就是一名社员，我们掌握他的根底，知道他的脾气，了解他的表现，便于对他进行教育。实在不够做人民教师的，我们还有权调整，选拔我们贫下中农的可心人去教育自己的子女，这样就能保证学校的办学方向和培养目标是正确的。所以，公办小学下放到大队办，我们贫下中农举双手拥护。
    我们贫下中农有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，有一本旧社会的苦难家史，有勤劳朴素的作风，这些就是我们办好农村小学的保证。“我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”
  辽宁省岫岩县贫代会委员　孙洪喜
