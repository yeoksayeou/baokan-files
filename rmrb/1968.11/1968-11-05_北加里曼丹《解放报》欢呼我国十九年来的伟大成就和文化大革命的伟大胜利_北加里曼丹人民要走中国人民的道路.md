According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, the October issue of the "Liberation Daily" of North Kalimantan published an editorial titled "Long Live the Great People's Republic of China!" enthusiastically celebrating the great achievements made under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the 19 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially the great victory of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The editorial states: "The Chinese revolution is the greatest, longest, sharpest, most complex, and most vivid revolutionary struggle in human history. The main force of this revolution is the Chinese working class and peasantry, with the working class as the leading class. The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is the vanguard and command center of the Chinese working class, while the highest commander of this vanguard and command center is Comrade Mao Zedong. His great and brilliant thoughts are the sole correct guiding ideology of this vanguard and command center."

The editorial states: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. In leading the Chinese revolution, he has inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising and developing it to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial states: "The victory of the Chinese revolution has opened up a bright path for the proletariat to lead the broad masses of the people in colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries to carry out revolutions and establish socialist societies. The main content of this path is: the proletarian party goes deep into the countryside, mobilizes and arms the peasant masses to carry out land revolutions, establishes rural revolutionary governments, surrounds the cities with the countryside, and finally seizes the cities to liberate the nation. This is a great development by Comrade Mao Zedong of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and revolution. It is the sole correct and bright path for the people of all colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries under imperialist rule to carry out revolutions and seize power. It is also the sole correct and necessary path for the people of North Kalimantan to carry out revolutions and seize power from the British imperialists and the feudal comprador clique of 'Malaysia,' to liberate North Kalimantan."

The editorial states: "The victory of the Chinese revolution is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is a great victory for the world proletariat and all revolutionary peoples. The victory of the Chinese revolution has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. It is a tremendous support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries and a fatal blow to imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries."

The editorial states: "The imperialists led by American imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries have always taken a hostile attitude towards the people's China under proletarian dictatorship. They are ambitious and covet to invade and overthrow this great new-type state. The modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist renegade clique act as lackeys of imperialism. They, along with a small handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and are great schemers and conspirators within the Chinese party and government organs, collude with external forces to plot the restoration of capitalism in China."

The editorial states: "However, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China and the 700 million Chinese people are invincible. They have boundless strength. They have continuously defeated all the sabotage, invasion, and subversion activities of the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary forces, making New China develop and grow stronger day by day."

The editorial points out: In 1966, Comrade Mao Zedong, with the great daring and revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, personally initiated and led hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to carry out the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution. The main target of this revolution is the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, smashing their plot to restore capitalism in China, and ensuring that the socialist red flag of the proletariat will never change color.

The editorial states: "After more than two years of fierce and stormy struggles, the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees consisting of three-in-one combinations have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, achieving a red sun rising over the entire nation."

The editorial states: The victory of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution has great and far-reaching international historical significance. "This is an invaluable contribution by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people to the world proletariat and the revolutionary peoples of all countries. This is a new milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism. It marks that Marxism-Leninism has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial states: Now, the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered and tested by the proletarian Cultural Revolution, are stronger than ever. The People's Republic of China has become a solid base for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries; the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has become the guiding ideology for the revolutionary struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world, becoming a great banner of our times.

The editorial states: "The people of North Kalimantan have drawn many precious experiences and lessons from the revolutionary practices of the Chinese people. We deeply feel from our own practices that the revolutionary struggles of the people of North Kalimantan must completely and thoroughly achieve victory. We must follow the path of the Chinese people and the path of Comrade Mao Zedong."

    北加里曼丹《解放报》欢呼我国十九年来的伟大成就和文化大革命的伟大胜利
    北加里曼丹人民要走中国人民的道路
    据新华社四日讯　北加里曼丹《解放报》十月号以《伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！》为题发表社论，热烈欢呼在毛主席的英明领导下，中华人民共和国成立十九周年来所取得的伟大成就，特别是中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    社论说：中国革命是人类历史上的一场最伟大、最长期、最尖锐、最复杂、最生动的革命斗争。“这个革命的主力军是中国工人阶级和农民阶级，而以工人阶级为领导阶级。伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队和战斗司令部，而作为这个先锋队和战斗司令部的最高统帅的是毛泽东同志，他的伟大的光辉思想则是这个先锋队和战斗司令部的唯一的正确的指导思想。”
    社论说：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他在领导中国革命的实践中继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高和发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。”
    社论说：“中国革命的胜利开辟了一条无产阶级领导广大人民群众在殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的国度里进行革命和建立社会主义社会的光明道路。这条道路的主要内容就是：无产阶级政党深入农村，发动和武装农民群众进行土地革命、建立农村革命政权，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市解放全国。这是毛泽东同志对于马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的学说的一个巨大发展，是一切被帝国主义统治的殖民地、半殖民地、半封建国家的人民进行革命夺取政权的唯一正确的光明道路，也是北加里曼丹人民进行革命，从英帝国主义和‘马来西亚’封建买办集团手中夺取政权，解放北加里曼丹的唯一正确与必经之路。”
    社论说：“中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是世界无产阶级和广大革命人民的伟大胜利。”“中国革命的胜利，大大地长了世界革命人民的志气，大大地灭了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的威风。它对于全世界各国人民的革命斗争是一个极其巨大的支持，对于帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派是一个极其致命的打击。”
    社论说：“以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，从来对无产阶级专政的人民中国采取敌视的态度。它们野心勃勃，妄想侵略和颠覆这个伟大的新型国家。以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者，充当帝国主义的走狗，他们和混进中国党政机关内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、大野心家、大阴谋家，里通外合，图谋在中国复辟资本主义。”
    社论说：“但是，在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下的中国共产党和七亿中国人民是坚不可摧的，他们有着无穷无尽的力量。他们不断战胜了帝修反的一切破坏、侵略和颠覆活动，使新中国一日千里地发展壮大起来。”
    社论指出：一九六六年，毛泽东同志以无产阶级的大无畏的特殊的革命魄力，亲自发动和领导了亿万革命群众进行中国无产阶级文化大革命。这个革命的主要锋芒是对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，粉碎他们妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，保证无产阶级的社会主义江山永不变色。
    社论说：“经过了两年多来的轰轰烈烈和急风暴雨般的大搏斗之后，中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。现在全中国除台湾省外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部建立了三结合的革命委员会，实现了全国山河一片红。”
    社论说：中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利具有伟大和深远的国际历史意义。“这是毛泽东同志、中国共产党和中国人民对世界无产阶级和各国革命人民的一个无可估量的贡献。这是马克思列宁主义发展史上的一个新的里程碑。它标志着马克思列宁主义已经发展到了毛泽东思想的阶段。”
    社论说：现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验的七亿中国人民是比过去更加坚强了。中华人民共和国已经成为世界各国人民革命的巩固根据地；光辉的毛泽东思想成为全世界革命人民进行革命斗争的指导思想，成为我们时代的一面伟大旗帜。
    社论说：“北加里曼丹人民从中国人民的革命实践中汲取了许多宝贵的经验和教训。我们从本身的实践中深刻地体会到，北加里曼丹人民的革命斗争要能取得完全彻底的胜利，一定要走中国人民的道路，一定要走毛泽东同志的道路。”
