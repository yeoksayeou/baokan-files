The public primary schools that have been converted to commune-run schools have changed the teachers' salaries to work points and provided them with rural rations. We believe that this is completely correct in terms of the overall direction. However, there are some practical issues, such as in schools implementing the nine-year unified system, where the teachers for grades six and seven are still provided by the state. In the same school, because of the different grades taught, the sources of teachers' salaries are different. More importantly, it is not convenient for the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the school. Therefore, all rural public primary schools (including affiliated junior high school classes) should be uniformly converted to commune-run schools, with teachers uniformly receiving work points and rural rations.

The solution to this problem is for the teachers of the affiliated junior high school classes to receive work points and rural rations, with appropriate subsidies collected through unified efforts. That is, the relevant communes should collectively raise part of the teachers' subsidy salaries. This approach is beneficial for the unity of teachers in the same school, beneficial for teachers to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and promotes the thought revolution of teachers.

### 附设初中班的教师也应记工分

    附设初中班的教师也应记工分
    公办小学校改为大队办，教师的工资改为记工分，吃农村粮。我们认为这样做大方向完全正确。不过也存在着一些实际的问题，譬如实行七年一贯制的学校，六、七年级的师资人员仍然由国家供给，在同一个学校里就因为教的年级不同，教师的工资来源就有所不同。更重要的是不便于贫下中农管理学校。因此，整个农村公办小学（包括附设初中班在内）应当一律改为大队办，教师一律记工分，吃农村粮。
    解决这个问题的办法是，附设初中班教师记工分，吃农村粮，其适当补助采取筹集的办法，即由有关的几个大队统一筹集教师的部分补助工资。这样做，有利于同一个学校的教师的团结，有利于教师接受贫下中农的再教育，促进教师的思想革命化。江苏省大丰县新团公社新隆大队退伍军人  方洪东
