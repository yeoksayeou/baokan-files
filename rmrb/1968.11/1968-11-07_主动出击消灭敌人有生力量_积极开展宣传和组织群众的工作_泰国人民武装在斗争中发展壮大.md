People's armed forces in northern Thailand have been actively striking out to eliminate enemy forces and have been actively carrying out propaganda and organizing the masses.

According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Sawan Province have frequently taken the initiative to strike at the enemy. The people's armed forces have also been intensifying their efforts to mobilize and organize the masses, continuously sending armed propaganda teams to various villages to mobilize and organize the people. Recently, an armed propaganda team of the people's armed forces conducted mobilization and organization work in the village of Ban Dan, which helped the local people see more clearly the ugly face of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries, deepened their hatred of the enemy, and saw that the people's armed forces are truly the people's army. They have become more active in supporting the people's armed forces in various ways.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently also broadcast that the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province are actively seeking favorable conditions to strike and eliminate the enemy. Between October 20 and 26, the people's armed forces in Phon County ambushed and attacked the reactionary military police sent by the Thanom-Praphat clique to suppress the people. The people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province also assisted the people in executing a notorious U.S.-Thai spy in Thoeng County.

The people's armed forces in Phitsanulok Province are growing stronger in their struggle against "encirclement and suppression." This has made the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique very fearful, plotting new suppression actions. The people's armed forces in this province not only bravely persisted in the struggle but also expanded their ranks, preparing to eliminate more enemies.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast on November 1 that since the people of Sakhon Nakhon Province united to organize armed forces to fight against the U.S.-Thanom clique, the armed forces in this province have continuously developed. Currently, in all six counties and two sub-counties of the province, six counties and one sub-county have organized armed forces, almost covering the entire province.

The radio station said that the brave people's armed forces of Sakhon Nakhon Province, responding to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and persisted in armed struggle. Because the people's armed forces of Sakhon Nakhon Province have learned and applied Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics of people's war, they have achieved victory after victory in countering the enemy's attacks and have actively struck at the enemy.

According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of this year to the end of October, the people's armed forces in various counties of Sakhon Nakhon Province ambushed the military police of the Thanom-Praphat clique, attacked enemy strongholds, and engaged in battles with the enemy about 110 times, killing and wounding many enemies, and seizing a batch of weapons.

The people's armed forces in this province have also sent armed propaganda teams to various villages to propagate, mobilize, and organize the masses, and have assisted the local people in eliminating 15 notorious officials and spies of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The radio station finally said that the rapid and extensive development of the people's armed struggle in Sakhon Nakhon Province fully proves that as long as the people unite and, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, resolutely carry out armed struggle, they will definitely be able to completely eliminate the enemy of the Thai people—the U.S.-Thanom clique.
