The people of Hubei's countryside have resolutely responded to the great battle call of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, filled with profound proletarian love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and swiftly launched a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hubei. From the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains to the banks of the Yangtze River, from the Jianghan Plain to remote mountain villages, the cries of denouncing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi echo everywhere; from the fields, work sites to villages and courtyards, the battlefields of exposing and criticizing, and thoroughly defeating Liu Shaoqi and his agents have been set up.

In the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly grasp the key issues most deeply affected and most influential by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in their regions for criticism. In the past, Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renhe in Hubei vigorously promoted "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in Dongfeng (originally Xiaogan), Jingmen, and Wuchang counties. The poor and lower-middle peasants of these counties, with deep hatred, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renhe. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfeng County took "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods as the focus, conducted repeated criticism, and launched an unprecedented large-scale activity of "investigating the poison, calculating the harm, and digging out the roots." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spoke and wrote, determined to thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renhe. This county's Hongwei Commune Jinxing Production Brigade was once the "work point" of the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Wang Renhe. Wang Renhe, following the orders of his black master Liu Shaoqi, concocted a so-called "Jinxing Road," opposing Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." After the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party, the poor and lower-middle peasants further carried out a thorough exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renhe, tearing off the mask of the "Jinxing Road." They angrily pointed out: "Material incentives" and "work points as the commander" are poison wrapped in sugar coating, a poisonous drug that leads us down the capitalist path. They said: We will settle the accounts of Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes one by one and criticize them one by one. We will criticize and expose the evil-doer Liu Shaoqi, the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and make him never be able to turn over a new leaf.

In the revolutionary criticism in Hubei's countryside, with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, cadres at all levels take the lead, forming a vast revolutionary criticism army, jointly exposing and criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Yingshan County, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, used their own blood and tears, and the iron-clad evidence of a handful of class enemies' conspiracies to restore capitalism, to speak out and recall the class oppression and exploitation of the old society, and severely denounced the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "class struggle extinction theory" and "exploitation is beneficial." They said, Liu Shaoqi, this big evil-doer, spread the "class struggle extinction theory" to blindfold our eyes and stuff our noses, making us poor and lower-middle peasants blind and noseless, so that the landlords and rich peasants can snatch our power and ride on our heads again. The profound and powerful criticism of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hit the vital points of the class enemies and also educated the broad masses. Revolutionary cadres took the lead in the battle, exposing the crimes of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and igniting the political enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses to actively participate in the revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary criticism in Hubei's vast countryside is closely linked with the class struggle in the region and unit, promoting the in-depth development of work such as cleaning up the class ranks.

After the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party, the county that first implemented the direct management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants and carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in a hot and lively manner, immediately saw a movement of learning, propagating, and implementing the communiqué among the people. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres deeply exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods peddled by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents like Wang Renhe, thoroughly unearthed hidden class enemies, and pushed the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the whole county to a new height.

The high tide of revolutionary criticism has brought about a high tide of revolution and production in Hubei's countryside. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the intense battle of the "three autumns," while deeply studying the communiqué, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, learned from the people of Dazhai, and walked the Dazhai path, farming for the revolution, and used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide the "three autumns" work. Therefore, the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing in various places not only progressed quickly but also had good quality, laying a solid foundation for achieving an even greater harvest in agricultural production next year.

　　对刘少奇的滔天罪行，一笔笔清算，一件件狠批
　　湖北农村掀起大批判新高潮
　　广大贫农下中农担当主力军
    新华社武汉十五日电　湖北省农村广大贫下中农，坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大战斗号召，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，迅速掀起彻底清算刘少奇及其在湖北地区代理人反革命罪行的革命大批判高潮。从大别山南麓到长江两岸，从江汉平原到偏僻山村，到处响起愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的口号声；从田头、工地到村庄、屋场，到处摆开了狠揭猛批、痛打落水狗刘少奇及其代理人的战场。
    广大贫下中农在革命大批判中，紧紧抓住本地区受刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线毒害最深、影响最大的关键问题首先批判。过去刘少奇及其在湖北地区的代理人王任重在东风（原孝感）、荆门、武昌等县大肆推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货。这些县的贫下中农怀着深仇大恨，狠批了刘少奇及其代理人王任重的反革命滔天罪行。东风县贫下中农把“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货作为重点，进行反复批判，开展了一个规模空前的“查流毒、算危害、挖根子”的活动。广大贫下中农口诛笔伐，决心彻底肃清刘少奇及其代理人王任重散布的反革命修正主义毒素。这个县的红卫公社金星大队曾是反革命修正主义分子王任重“蹲点”的地方。王任重秉承其黑主子刘少奇的旨意，炮制了一个所谓“金星道路”，对抗毛主席发出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召。党的十二中全会公报发表后，贫下中农进一步开展了对刘少奇及其代理人王任重的反革命罪行的大揭发、大批判，剥开了“金星道路”的画皮。他们愤慨地指出：“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”是糖衣包着的砒霜，是引我们走资本主义邪路的毒药。他们说：刘少奇这个大坏蛋的滔天罪行，我们要一笔笔地算，一件件地批。把刘少奇这个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，批倒批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。
    湖北农村开展革命大批判中，以贫下中农为主力军，各级干部带头上阵，结成浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，共同狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的滔天罪行。应山县广大贫下中农，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，用自己的血泪史，用一小撮阶级敌人进行复辟资本主义阴谋活动的铁的罪证，大讲大忆旧社会的阶级压迫和阶级剥削苦，痛斥大叛徒刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义谬论。他们说，刘少奇这个大坏蛋散布“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就是想蒙住我们的眼睛，塞住我们的鼻子，叫我们贫下中农眼不亮，鼻不灵，好让地主富农夺去我们的印把子，重新骑在我们头上拉屎拉尿。广大贫下中农深刻有力的批判，击中了阶级敌人的要害，也教育了广大群众。革命干部带头上阵，控诉党内头号走资派刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行，激发了广大革命群众积极投入革命大批判的政治热情。
    湖北广大农村的革命大批判，同本地区、本单位的阶级斗争实际紧密结合，推动了清理阶级队伍等项工作的深入发展。
    党的十二中全会公报发表后，全省最早实现贫下中农直接管理学校，斗、批、改搞得热火朝天的谷城县，立即出现了学习、宣传、落实的群众运动。广大贫下中农和革命干部，深揭深批党内头号走资派刘少奇及其代理人王任重之流贩卖的反革命修正主义黑货，深挖暗藏的阶级敌人，把全县的斗、批、改推向了新高涨。
    革命大批判的高潮，带来了湖北农村抓革命、促生产的高潮。广大贫下中农在奋战“三秋”的紧张战斗中，一面深入学习公报，一面大破反革命修正主义黑货，学大寨人，走大寨路，为革命种田，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅“三秋”工作。因此，各地秋收、秋耕、秋种不仅进度快，而且质量好，为夺取明年农业生产更大丰收打下了坚实的基础。
