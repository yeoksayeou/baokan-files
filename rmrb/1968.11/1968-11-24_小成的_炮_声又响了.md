Recently, during a criticism meeting held by the cooking team of the 3rd Company of the 7024th Unit, the new soldier Xiao Cheng, who usually leads the charge, suddenly became a "silent cannon." To get to the bottom of the issue and provide a targeted solution, the team leader Chen Da Xuan asked other comrades about the reason for Xiao Cheng's silence. It turned out that Xiao Cheng believed that the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi had already been expelled from the Party, and that this political corpse would not be heated even if thrown into a steel furnace. He also said, "The Party has already sentenced Liu Shaoqi to political death; even without criticism, he stinks."

The team leader realized that Xiao Cheng's issue was not just about whether to engage in revolutionary criticism but about whether to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. He immediately went to talk with Xiao Cheng. Together, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "At any time, we must not forget class struggle." He said meaningfully, "Xiao Cheng, have you noticed if there is a 'brand' of Liu Shaoqi in your mind?" Xiao Cheng asked in surprise, "What 'brand'?" The team leader pointed to the "Communiqué" and said, "The Plenum calls on all Party members and the people of the entire country to continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly sweep away the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the Party. But you think that Liu Shaoqi stinks even without criticism. Isn't this a 'brand' of his theory of the extinction of class struggle?"

At this moment, Xiao Cheng suddenly realized. He hated Liu Shaoqi, who was more venomous than a snake, and immediately joined the team leader in severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle. The team leader said, "Liu Shaoqi is still alive, and his heart is not dead. Especially his spread of the theory of the extinction of class struggle is his lifesaving 'elixir.' He tries to sedate us, making us sleep on the tip of his bayonet, so he can sneak past. We must thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi until he is completely exposed and stinks, so that the country will not turn revisionist and people will not change quality." Xiao Cheng clenched his fists and angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle is a soft knife that kills without blood. I have this 'brand' in my mind, so I have half-hearted revolutionary thoughts. Isn't this letting the 'tiger' back into the mountains in my mind?" He then excitedly said, "Chairman Mao said, 'It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu.' I will raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist thoughts, and carry the revolution to the end."

Through the criticism, Xiao Cheng realized: forgetting revolutionary criticism is forgetting class struggle, forgetting socialism, and forgetting Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest selfishness and the greatest act of forgetting one's roots. From then on, he set a rule for himself: in any situation, first carry out revolutionary criticism and implement Chairman Mao's instructions through revolutionary criticism. In this way, Xiao Cheng's "gun" sounded again.

### 小成的“炮”声又响了

    小成的“炮”声又响了
    最近，七○二四部队机三连炊事班开批判会时，向来打头炮的新战士小成忽然成了个“哑炮筒”。班长陈大宣为了弄个水落石出，对症下药，便向其他同志了解小成不发言的原因。原来，小成认为叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇已经从党内“吐”出去了，这具政治僵尸就是放进钢炉也热不了了。他还说：“党已经宣判了刘少奇的政治死刑，不批也臭了。”班长意识到，小成的思想不单是搞不搞革命大批判的问题，而是要不要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。
    于是，班长马上去找小成谈心。他和小成共同学习了毛主席的教导：“任何时候都不可忘记阶级斗争”。他意味深长地说：“小成呵，你看没看到脑子里有刘少奇这家伙的‘烙印’呢？”小成吃惊地问：“什么‘烙印’？”班长指着“公报”说：“全会号召全党同志和全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。可你呢，却认为刘少奇不批也臭了，这不是打上了他的‘阶级斗争熄灭论’的烙印吗？”
    这时，小成恍然大悟。他恨透了刘少奇这个比蛇蝎还毒的家伙，他马上和班长一起狠批了刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。班长说：“刘少奇人还在，心不死，尤其是他散布的‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，是他的救命‘灵丹’。他企图麻醉我们，使我们躺在他的刺刀尖上睡大觉，以便他蒙混过关。我们只有彻底把刘少奇批倒批臭，才能使国家不变修，人不变质。”小成捏紧拳头，愤怒地说：“刘少奇的‘阶级斗争熄灭论’是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。我脑里打上了它这个‘烙印’，所以就有半截子革命的思想，这不是在思想里放这只‘老虎’归山了吗？”他又激动地说：“毛主席说‘宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。’我要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的流毒，将革命进行到底。”
    通过大批判，小成认识到：忘记了革命大批判，就是忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了社会主义，忘记了毛泽东思想，这是最大的私心，最大的忘本。从这以后，他每天给自己规定了一条：一事当前，首先开展革命大批判，通过革命大批判，落实毛主席各项指示。就这样，小成的“炮”声又响了。
