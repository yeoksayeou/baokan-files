	South Yemen friends warmly hail the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the brilliant achievements of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, regarding them as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

	A South Yemen friend who has visited China said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great school for the broad masses of the people to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He said that exposing and expelling the counter-revolutionary revisionist and traitor Liu Shaoqi from the Party is a great victory of the Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This will greatly encourage the Chinese people to advance along the broad road of socialism and communism.

	He said, as I have seen in China, during the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people have greatly raised their political consciousness. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people, especially the workers and peasants, know that they are not working for themselves but for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. They understand that helping the people who are still struggling for liberation is their internationalist duty. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has greatly promoted the development of production in China. He also said that the victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has profound significance and influence on the world revolutionary movement.

	A female trade union member said that expelling the traitor Liu Shaoqi, who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, from the Party and revoking all his positions inside and outside the Party is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the Cultural Revolution. She said that the Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has greatly strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat in China. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxist-Leninist thought that opposes revisionism and guides the people to socialism and communism.

	A South Yemen youth said that Mao Zedong Thought is a great revolutionary thought. The Cultural Revolution has spread Mao Zedong Thought widely among the Chinese people and the people of the world. He said that overthrowing and expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party shows that as long as the masses grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, they can solve any problem.

	He also said that Chairman Mao has developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism and brought it to a new stage. He believes that the Chinese people, who have undergone various tests in the Cultural Revolution, will, after smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, more resolutely defend the socialist homeland under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and more firmly support the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

    南也门朋友热情欢呼中共八届十二中全会的光辉成就
    文化大革命的伟大胜利对世界革命有深远意义
    新华社亚丁十九日电　南也门朋友热情欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的光辉成就，认为这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    一位访问过中国的南也门朋友说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是广大人民群众学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大学校。他说，把埋藏在中国共产党内的反革命修正主义分子、内奸刘少奇揪出来并永远开除出党，这是文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这将大大鼓舞中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义的康庄大道前进。
    他说，正如我在中国看到的，在文化大革命期间，中国人民大大提高了政治觉悟。在毛泽东思想教导下，中国人民，特别是工农群众，都知道他们不是为自己而工作，而是为中国革命和世界革命而工作。他们明白，帮助仍在争取解放的人民是他们的国际主义义务。因此，中国无产阶级文化大革命大大促进了中国的生产的发展。他还说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，对于世界革命运动有深远的意义和影响。
    一位女工会会员说，把反对无产阶级专政的工人阶级的叛徒刘少奇永远开除出党并撤消其党内外的一切职务，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。她说，在毛泽东思想指导下进行的这次无产阶级文化大革命大大加强了中国的无产阶级专政。毛泽东思想是反对修正主义，引导人民走向社会主义和共产主义的马克思列宁主义思想。
    一位南也门青年说，毛泽东思想是伟大的革命思想。文化大革命使毛泽东思想在中国人民和世界人民中间得到广泛的传播。他说，把埋藏在中国共产党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇打倒并永远开除出党，这一事实清楚地表明，只要人民群众掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，任何事情都一定能够解决。
    他还说，毛泽东主席发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义，并把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。他相信，在无产阶级文化大革命中经受了各种考验的中国人民，在粉碎了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部以后，在毛泽东思想的指引下，会更坚决地保卫祖国的社会主义，更坚定地支持世界各国人民反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争。
