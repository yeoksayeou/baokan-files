Title: The "Theory of Intra-Party Peace" That Strangles the Revolutionary Spirit of Party Members

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Differing thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection within the Party of the class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in society. If there are no contradictions and no ideological struggles to resolve them, the life of the Party will come to a halt." The facts are indeed like this. The Party is full of struggle, not peace, not compromise. Our Party must conduct intra-party struggles to become a vibrant and combat-effective Party. Only in the extremely fierce and complex struggles between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines can a Communist Party member "weather the storm and see the world," and be tempered into a vanguard fighter of the proletariat.

The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been vigorously promoting and spreading the "theory of intra-party peace," shouting at the top of his lungs: "Intra-party struggles will deepen ideological, political, organizational, and action-related differences within the Party, deepen the phenomenon of disunity within the Party, and even cause the Party to split." Liu Shaoqi attempts to use "intra-party peace" to deceive and lull our Party members, attempting to make our Party members lose their revolutionary spirit and vigilance, to protect him and a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party, and to gradually transform Party members politically into his docile tools, so that he can usurp the Party and the government and restore capitalism.

I am a child from a poor family. During the war of resistance against Japan, I proudly joined the Communist Party of China. In the long years of revolutionary war, we fought against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, risking our lives. The string of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in our minds was always taut, and we dared to firmly struggle against erroneous tendencies within the Party. After the liberation of the whole country, I was transferred to work in the old municipal committee of Qingdao and stayed in the office for a long time. Liu Shaoqi's agents in Qingdao actively promoted his "theory of intra-party peace," and I was poisoned. My consciousness of class struggle became increasingly weak.

When I was the deputy director of the office, there was a self-surrendering turncoat and a traitor among my colleagues. However, Liu Shaoqi's agents in Qingdao said: "They can stay in the Party to work." Poisoned by the "theory of intra-party peace," I did not dare to struggle, fearing that it would cause ideological and organizational "splits." As a result, I fell into their trap. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and launched a fierce attack on a handful of capitalist roaders within the old municipal committee. However, I did not understand and thought that those capitalist roaders were all "old Party members," and did not rise up to struggle against them, which shows how deeply I was poisoned.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution exposed a handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, making me realize the reactionary essence of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Qingdao who were so eager to peddle the "theory of intra-party peace." On the one hand, they shouted "intra-party peace" to strangle the revolutionary spirit of Party members, making Party members into politically mediocre individuals without a sense of enemy danger. On the other hand, they preserved the "waste" within the Party and brought in class enemies, causing the Party to degenerate. All of this aroused my deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi. I actively joined the battle, exposed the crimes of a handful of "black elements" in the old municipal committee, fiercely criticized the reactionary words and deeds of this handful of wolves in sheep's clothing, and engaged in a head-on struggle with them.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without expelling the old and taking in the new, the Party will lose its vigor." To "expel the old and take in the new," we must actively carry out the struggle between the two lines within the Party. I am determined to remember Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "expel the old and take in the new" and, with practical actions, thoroughly criticize and expose the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of intra-party peace."

　　扼杀党员革命精神的“党内和平论”
　　青岛啤酒厂下放干部　张秉勋
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”事实正是这样。党内是充满斗争的，不是和平的，不是妥协的。我们的党要成为生气勃勃的党，有战斗力的党，就要进行党内斗争。一个共产党员也只有在极其激烈、极其复杂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中“经风雨，见世面”，才能锻炼成为无产阶级的先锋战士。
    刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，大肆鼓吹和散布“党内和平论”，声嘶力竭地叫嚷：“党内斗争会加深党内思想上、政治上、组织上、行动上的分歧，加深党内不团结的现象，甚至造成党的分裂”。刘少奇妄图用“党内和平”来欺骗和麻痹我们党员，妄图使我们党员丧失革命朝气、革命警惕性，以保护他和钻进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，进一步从政治上把党员“和平演变”成为他的驯服工具，以便他篡党篡政，复辟资本主义。
    我是一个贫苦人家的孩子，在抗日战争的烽火中光荣地加入了中国共产党。在长期革命战争中，我们打日寇，打蒋匪，出生入死，头脑中阶级斗争和两条路线斗争这根“弦”始终绷得紧紧的，敢于同党内的错误倾向作坚决的斗争。全国解放后，转业到青岛旧市委工作，长期蹲在机关。刘少奇在青岛的代理人，积极推销他的“党内和平论”，我中了毒。阶级斗争观念越来越淡薄。
    我在担任办公室副主任时，在一起工作的有一个是自首变节分子，有一个是叛徒。但是刘少奇在青岛的代理人说：“他们可以留在党内工作。”我受了“党内和平论”的毒害，也不敢进行斗争，怕引起思想上和组织上的“分裂”，结果上了他们的鬼圈套。无产阶级文化大革命初期，广大革命群众高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向旧市委内一小撮走资派猛烈开火，而自己很不理解，认为那些走资派都是“老党员”，没有起来同他们斗争，可见中毒之深。
    无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务等反革命分子，使我认清了刘少奇及其在青岛的代理人如此卖力地贩卖“党内和平论”的反动实质。他们一方面大喊“党内和平”，扼杀党员的革命性，使党员成为没有敌情观念的政治庸人；另一方面把党内的“废料”保存下来，把阶级敌人拉进来，使党变质。这一切激发了我对刘少奇的无比仇恨。我积极投入战斗，揭发旧市委一小撮“黑班底”的罪恶，猛批这一小撮披着羊皮的豺狼的反动言行，同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”要“吐故纳新”，就要积极开展党内两条路线的斗争。我决心牢记毛主席“吐故纳新”的最新指示，以实际行动把刘少奇的“党内和平论”批倒批臭，彻底肃清其流毒。
