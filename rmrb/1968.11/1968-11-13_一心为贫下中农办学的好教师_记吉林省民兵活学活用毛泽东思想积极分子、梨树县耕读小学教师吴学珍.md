In Liushuguan Commune's Sanjiaowobu Village of Lishu County, Jilin Province, there is a primary school called Cultivate and Study, which was established and managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves. This school has only one teacher, Wu Xuezhen, an active member of the militia who studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought, and a daughter of a poor peasant. Since the establishment of the Cultivate and Study School, she has firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, educating the poor and lower-middle peasants and using Mao Zedong Thought to educate students. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise her, saying, "We can rest assured when our children are with Teacher Wu."

Educating for the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Before 1965, Sanjiaowobu Village had only one public primary school. In the village of Sanjiaowobu, two miles away from this school, a phenomenon emerged: all ten children of landlords and rich peasants were enrolled in school, with two already in middle school. However, more than thirty children of poor and lower-middle peasants were kept out of school and could only listen to the reading from outside the school walls. Many poor and lower-middle peasants often gathered around Wu Xuezhen, who had graduated from elementary school in 1962 and returned to the village to participate in agricultural labor, saying, "Xuezhen, we have suffered enough from not being able to read and write. When will we be able to establish our own school for the poor and lower-middle peasants?" The poor and lower-middle peasants' urgent desire to establish a school touched Wu Xuezhen's heart. She opened the radiant works of Chairman Mao and was taught, "In China, only landlords have culture, while peasants have none." "Once the landlord class is overthrown in the countryside, the cultural movement of the peasants begins." Chairman Mao's words made Wu Xuezhen's heart even brighter. She thought, in the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants had no culture because the power was in the hands of the landlord class. In the new society, Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the landlords and seize power; but we only have the "gun" and not the "pen." If we do not have the pen, the power will not be consolidated and may even be lost. Thinking of this, Wu Xuezhen's blood boiled. Thus, she decided to establish a school for the poor and lower-middle peasants with an unyielding heart loyal to Chairman Mao and a class sentiment to fight for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

At this time, the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association, Ren Hai, represented the poor and lower-middle peasants to support her, saying, "Xuezhen, you want to establish a primary school for us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the right path. Go ahead and do it. If there are any difficulties, we poor and lower-middle peasants will take them on."

Wu Xuezhen, full of confidence, walked into the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants and enrolled more than thirty children of poor and lower-middle peasants who had been rejected by the bourgeois intellectuals' school on the grounds of "unhealthy mind" and "failed exams." Some poor and lower-middle peasants were surprised and said, "Xuezhen, this child was not even accepted by the front village school (referring to the public school), will you accept them?" Wu Xuezhen firmly replied, "This is our own school. We must accept them!" This made the poor and lower-middle peasants overjoyed, and they eagerly sent their children to school.

Wu Xuezhen, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "education must serve proletarian politics," under the leadership of the Cultivate and Study School's leadership group composed of four old poor peasants, created all the conditions for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enroll in school. Some students, after their parents went to work, had to be left behind to take care of the children and could not come to school on time. Wu Xuezhen thought that the Cultivate and Study School must truly open its doors to the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, so she had to start from the actual situation of the poor and lower-middle peasants, urgently addressing their needs and thinking of their thoughts. Thus, she broke the "framework" of the revisionist educational line and abolished the old system of "no tardiness, no early departure." The children of poor and lower-middle peasants could come to school at any time, and if they could not come during the day, they could make up for it in the evening, without missing a class due to wind or rain.

After the Cultivate and Study School was established, the poor and lower-middle peasants would go to their own school to drink water and smoke during their breaks from work, happily watching their children study. They sighed with emotion, saying, "Chairman Mao's leadership is great! Such a Cultivate and Study School is just to our liking."

Building the School with Mao Zedong Thought

Chairman Mao taught us, "Half-work, half-study, self-reliant, and thrifty... Such a school is indeed very good." Wu Xuezhen, in the process of establishing the school, firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and did not ask the state for money nor did she ask the poor and lower-middle peasants for money. At the beginning, the school only had half a room provided by an old poor peasant, with no desks or chairs. She led the students to build earth platforms and mud stools as substitutes. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied and said, "Our children sitting on earth platforms to study will not forget the spirit of hard work and simplicity!" During their free time, she led the students to pick up scraps of iron, rope ends, and bones to exchange for chalk and notebooks, solving the problem of teaching funds. When winter came, the public school would go hundreds of miles to the city to get coal for heating, so she led the young students to pick up cow dung in the fields to use for heating.

In the past, the public school in this village required students to have "uniform books, uniform pens, uniform tuition fees, and decent clothes." With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Wu Xuezhen established a new school rule: "Quotations from Chairman Mao, dung baskets, and sewing kits must be uniform." She also set up a "thrift box" in the classroom, cultivating in the children of poor and lower-middle peasants the communist qualities of hard work, simplicity, and loyalty to Chairman Mao from a young age.

The Cultivate and Study School placed class education and Mao Zedong Thought courses in an important position, inviting an old poor peasant woman with a deep hatred of the old society to give a lecture on the first day of school about her family's bloody history in the old society. When the old poor peasant spoke of the family being driven to desperation by the landlord, selling their daughter to escape, the children all shed tears and raised their small fists, shouting, "Down with the landlords!" Wu Xuezhen then spoke of Chairman Mao leading the poor to revolution and his great achievements. This cultivated in these young children a class sentiment of hating the old society and loving Chairman Mao.

Once, a director from the county's education bureau came to the Cultivate and Study School to "inspect" the work and saw Wu Xuezhen teaching the students the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He frowned and said, "The higher authorities have not stipulated this. If you teach it wrong, it will be serious!" Facing this "authority," she angrily said, "What we teach is based on our class standpoint. Chairman Mao is our great savior, and Chairman Mao's book is our lifeline. We not only teach it but also teach the young students to use it and be loyal to Chairman Mao for life." This director, having been rebuked, left in embarrassment. The poor and lower-middle peasants all praised Wu Xuezhen for her firm stance and courage to confront "authority." She said, "What we teach and what courses we give are not just a simple matter of textbooks, but a fundamental issue of which class's ideology we use to build the school."

With the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Wu Xuezhen established five courses for the Cultivate and Study School: Quotations from Chairman Mao, class education, labor, culture, and military. She also set five unchangeable teaching systems: Quotations from Chairman Mao every day, "Three Articles" every day, news programs every day, "Three Loyalty" activities every day, and lecture meetings every week; and required students to do three things without leaving: not leaving Chairman Mao's book, not leaving Chairman Mao's teachings when speaking, and not leaving Mao Zedong Thought when doing things.

Cultivating Red Successors

What kind of teacher cultivates what kind of student. The active member of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, Wu Xuezhen, in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and transforming her worldview, did not act like a "teacher" and always set an example, cultivating students to be revolutionary successors loyal to Chairman Mao.

Every year, the production team allocated five mu of land to the Cultivate and Study School. Wu Xuezhen personally led the students to work from planting to harvesting, with hoes and sickles never leaving their hands. During the busy season, Wu Xuezhen moved the classroom to the fields, leading the students to study while working. Once, there were "heartworms" in the cornfield, which had to be picked by hand, and some young students were afraid. She studied with the students Chairman Mao's teachings on "firmly deciding, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." She told the young students: picking worms is like fighting the enemy, and eliminating the enemy requires not fearing sacrifice. She recited Chairman Mao's quotations with the students while teaching them to pick worms. Under her influence, the young students all bravely picked worms, eliminating the corn pests.

In the past three years, the young students led by Wu Xuezhen, as they grew older, became more loyal to Chairman Mao. They were hardworking, simple, and selfless. They washed their own clothes when they were dirty, mended them when they were torn; made their own desks and chairs; raised pigs and grew vegetables, doing everything themselves. The students also helped the "Five Guarantees" fetch water and chop firewood. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: Wu Xuezhen's students are "Little Leifengs" and "Little Red Guards."

Under Wu Xuezhen's diligent cultivation, among the initial thirty-two students, fourteen were active members of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the commune and production brigade, and the rest were outstanding members of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the production team. The son of a poor peasant, Shi Baogui, was rejected three times by the public school of the brigade, saying he had an "unhealthy mind." Under Wu Xuezhen's education, he can now recite more than thirty quotations from Chairman Mao and recognize more than four hundred characters; when the wall of the "Five Guarantees" was broken, he helped repair it, and he also volunteered to do work for the collective.

During the Cultural Revolution, Wu Xuezhen led the young students to bravely participate in the fiery class struggle. She and the students formed four propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought. Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they went deep into the masses to propagate, making Chairman Mao's voice known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Wherever she and the students propagated, they participated in the class struggle and carried out revolutionary criticism. In this way, in the minds of the young students, who the enemy was and who the friend was became clear. Eleven-year-old Gong Wenju, during the struggle against the landlord element Yang Shu, pointed at the landlord's nose and exposed the evil fact that three years ago he drove the collective's pigs into the well. The young students criticized the class enemies in the meeting and returned to the production team to supervise the class enemies. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "Such successors are reliable and reassuring!"

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" were issued, the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the Cultivate and Study School, which they had long loved, even more enthusiastically. They changed the original leadership group of four old poor peasants into an educational revolution committee with seven members; immediately built six rooms, added one more teacher, and enrolled more than forty new students, making the Cultivate and Study School present a vibrant new scene. The poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to manage the public school well, also elected Wu Xuezhen as the deputy director of the central school's educational revolution committee. Wu Xuezhen, holding the Little Red Book and with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line in her heart, came to the public school. She and the poor and lower-middle peasants, as soon as they entered the public school, vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism, united the active elements among the teachers and students, isolated and struck a small handful of class enemies, making the public school quickly change its appearance. Wu Xuezhen pledged to Chairman Mao, "I will never leave Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line for life and always hold the cultural power for the poor and lower-middle peasants."

　　一心为贫下中农办学的好教师
　　——记吉林省民兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、梨树县耕读小学教师吴学珍
    在吉林省梨树县刘家馆子公社三家窝堡大队，有一所贫下中农亲自创办、亲自管理的耕读小学。这所小学只有一名教师，就是吉林省民兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、贫农的女儿吴学珍。从创办耕读小学以来，她坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，为贫下中农办学，用毛泽东思想教育学生。贫下中农称赞说：“把子女交给咱们的吴老师，真是放心！”
    为贫下中农办学
    一九六五年以前，三家窝堡大队只有一所公办小学。离这个小学二里路的三家窝堡屯，出现这样的现象：全屯十户地主、富农的子女全部入学，并有两名已升中学。而贫下中农有三十多名子女被关在学校门外，只得爬墙头去听读书声。许多贫下中农经常围着一九六二年从高小毕业后回乡参加农业劳动的吴学珍说：“学珍，不识字的苦滋味咱算尝够了，啥时才能办个咱贫下中农自己的学校呢？”贫下中农办学的迫切心情，说得吴学珍心里热乎乎的。她翻开光芒四射的毛主席著作，毛主席教导说：“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。”“农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。”毛主席的话使吴学珍心里更亮堂了。她想，旧社会，贫下中农没有文化，就是因为政权掌握在地主阶级手里。新社会，毛主席领导我们打倒了地主，夺取了政权；可我们手里光拿了“枪杆子”，不拿“笔杆子”，政权就不能巩固，还有可能失去政权。想到这里，吴学珍热血沸腾。于是，她怀着无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，怀着为贫下中农争口气的阶级感情，决心要为贫下中农办一所学校。
    这时，大队贫协主席任海代表贫下中农支持她说：“学珍，你要办一所咱贫下中农自己的小学，这路子走的对。你尽管干，有困难，咱贫下中农承担。”
    吴学珍满怀信心地走进了贫下中农的家门，把资产阶级知识分子统治的学校，以“理智不健全”，“考试不及格”等为借口拒在门外的三十多名贫下中农子女，统统写在名册上。有的贫下中农社员惊讶地说：“学珍啊，这孩子连前屯学校（指公办小学）都不收，你收吗？”吴学珍斩钉截铁地说：“这是咱自己办的学校。一定收！”这下可乐坏了贫下中农，他们纷纷把子女送到学校。
    吴学珍按照毛主席关于“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务”的伟大教导，在由四个老贫农组成的耕读小学领导小组的领导下，为贫下中农子女入学创造了一切条件。有些学生，父母一下地，就得留下哄孩子，不能按时到校。吴学珍想到耕读小学要彻底为贫下中农子女开门，就得从贫下中农的实际情况出发，急贫下中农所急，想贫下中农所想。于是，她打破了修正主义教育路线的“框框”，取消了“不迟到、不早退”的旧制度。贫下中农子女啥时来啥时给讲课，白天不能来，晚上去补课，风雨不误。
    耕读小学办起以后，贫下中农干活休息时，就到自己的耕读小学去喝水、抽烟，喜看自己子女念书。他们十分感慨地说：“毛主席领导的好啊！这样的耕读小学就是合咱们心意。”
    用毛泽东思想建校
    毛主席教导我们：“半工半读，勤工俭学，不要国家一分钱……这样的学校确是很好的。”吴学珍在办学过程中，牢牢记着毛主席的教导，没有向国家要钱，也没有向贫下中农伸手。一开始，学校只有老贫农让出来的一间半房，一无桌二无凳。她就带领学生搭土台子，修泥墩子代替。贫下中农十分满意地说：“咱们的孩子坐在土台子上念书，不会忘记艰苦朴素的本色！”在课余时间，她带领学生拣碎铁、绳头、骨头，用来换粉笔、笔记本，解决教学经费问题。一到冬天，公办的学校就到几百里以外的城里拉取暖煤，她便带领小学生下甸子拣牛粪，用来生炉子取暖。
    过去，这个屯的公办学校规定学生“本齐、笔齐、学费齐，穿的象样。”吴学珍在贫下中农帮助下，建立了革命的新校规：“《毛主席语录》齐、粪筐齐、针线包齐。”并在教室里设立了“勤俭箱”，使贫下中农子女从小就养成艰苦朴素，热爱劳动，忠于毛主席的共产主义品质。
    耕读小学把上阶级教育课和毛泽东思想课放在重要位置，开学第一课就请苦大仇深的一个贫农老太太上讲台，讲在旧社会的血泪家史。当老贫农讲到全家人被地主逼得没有活路，卖掉女儿去逃荒时，孩子们都流下了眼泪，举起小拳头高喊：“打倒地主！”接着，吴学珍就讲毛主席领着穷人闹革命的丰功伟绩。这就使这些刚懂事的孩子们，培养了痛恨旧社会、热爱毛主席的阶级感情。
    一次，县文教局的一个主任到耕读小学“检查”工作，见吴学珍给学生上《毛主席语录》课，就板起面孔说：“上级没有规定，讲错了可不得了啊！”面对这个“权威”，她气愤地说：“我们教什么书，是凭阶级立场出发的。毛主席是我们的大救星，毛主席的书是我们的命根子。我们不但要教，还要教小学生用，教他们一辈子忠于毛主席。”这个主任碰了一鼻子灰溜走了。贫下中农都夸赞吴学珍立场稳，胆子大，敢碰“权威”。她说：“教什么书，上什么课，这不是个简单的课本问题，而是用哪个阶级的思想建校的根本大事。”
    在贫下中农的支持下，吴学珍给耕读小学制定了五门课：毛主席语录课、阶级教育课、劳动课、文化课、军事课。她还订了五个雷打不动的教学制度：语录课天天上，“老三篇”天天读，新闻节目天天听，“三忠于”活动天天做，讲用会周周开；并要求学生做到三不离：身不离毛主席的书，说话不离毛主席的教导，办事不离毛泽东思想。
    培养红色接班人
    什么样的老师，培育什么样的学生。活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子吴学珍，在活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，改造世界观上，不摆“先生”架子，处处以身作则，培养学生做忠于毛主席的革命接班人。
    生产队每年给耕读小学拨五亩地。吴学珍就亲自带领学生一起干，从种到收，锄镰不离手。大忙季节，吴学珍便把课堂搬到田间，一边带领学生劳动，一边学习。一次，地里的玉米有了“钻心虫”，必须用手抓，有些小学生害怕。她就和学生一起学习毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导。她对小学生说：抓虫就是打敌人，消灭敌人就要不怕牺牲。她一边和学生共同背诵毛主席语录，一边教学生抓虫。在她的带动下，小学生们都勇敢地抓虫子，消灭了玉米害虫。
    三年来，吴学珍带领的这些小学生，随着年龄的增长，忠于毛主席的红心更红了。他们艰苦朴素，热爱劳动，一心为公。衣服脏了自己洗，破了自己补；桌凳自己做；养猪种菜，样样自己动手干。学生们还帮助“五保户”挑水、砍柴。贫下中农说：吴学珍教出来的学生是“小雷锋”、“小红军”。
    在吴学珍的辛勤培育下，在最初吸收进来的三十二名学生中，有十四名是公社和生产大队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，其余的都是生产队活学活用毛泽东思想的“尖子”。贫农的儿子石宝贵，大队那个公办学校，三次招生都不要他，说他“理智不健全”。在吴学珍的教育下，如今能背诵三十多条毛主席语录，认识四百多字；“五保户”的墙坏了，他帮助抹泥，平时还抢着给集体干活。
    在文化大革命中，吴学珍带领小学生，勇敢地投入了火热的阶级斗争。她和学生们一起组成了四个毛泽东思想宣传队，每次毛主席的最新指示发表，他们就深入群众宣传，使毛主席的声音家喻户晓，深入人心。她和学生们宣传到哪里，就参加哪里的阶级斗争，搞革命大批判。这样，在小学生的心目中，谁是敌人，谁是朋友，一清二楚。十一岁的宫文举在批斗地主分子杨书时，指着地主的鼻子揭发了三年前他把集体的猪往井里赶的罪恶事实。小学生们在会上批斗阶级敌人，回到生产队就监督阶级敌人。贫下中农高兴地说：“这样的接班人就是过硬，就是放心！”
    毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示发表后，贫下中农对这所早就爱在心上的耕读小学管得更起劲了。他们把原来由四个老贫农组成的领导小组，变成由七个人参加的教育革命委员会；并立刻动手盖了六间房，增派一名教师，新招收四十多名学生，使耕读小学出现了一片沸腾的新景象。贫下中农为了管理好那个公办的学校，又推选吴学珍当中心校教育革命委员会副主任。吴学珍手捧红宝书，胸怀毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，来到公办学校。她和贫下中农一开进公办学校，就狠抓革命大批判，团结师生中的积极分子，孤立打击一小撮阶级敌人，使公办学校很快变了样。吴学珍向毛主席表忠心说：“一辈子不离开毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，永远为贫下中农掌好文权”。　  吉梨武
