The revolutionary committee of Muchengjian Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, has fully mobilized the masses to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in a resounding and magnificent manner.

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Muchengjian Coal Mine has been assisting the revolutionary committee in propagating, implementing, and carrying out the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué. They have fully mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement. After the communiqué was issued, they consecutively held mass rallies to celebrate the issuance of the communiqué and to denounce and criticize the great traitor, great internal spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They extensively and deeply propagated the spirit of the communiqué and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the grand movement to propagate and implement the communiqué, the entire mine has launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation that is both resounding and solid.

There was a struggle over whether to fully mobilize the masses to create a broad mass movement to propagate and implement the communiqué, or to be satisfied with merely beating drums and gongs to celebrate and consider the matter settled. On the day after the communiqué was issued, according to the original schedule, a production meeting was to be held to discuss the 1969 production plan. Most comrades thought the original schedule should be changed, but a few believed that since the entire mine's workers had already celebrated with drums and gongs, it would be sufficient to leave a few people to handle it, and the production meeting should not be delayed. The leftist support personnel from the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine and all members of the revolutionary committee studied and discussed the great significance of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué. Through study, everyone realized that the battle cry put forward in the communiqué is the center of all current work and must be immediately organized for all revolutionary workers in the mine to seriously study, deeply understand, and quickly implement.

After unifying their ideological understanding, they immediately held an all-night celebration rally for all workers and their families in the mine. After the meeting, the entire mine immediately launched a mass movement to propagate the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. From the surface to the underground, from the working face to the family area, everywhere became a battlefield for propagating the communiqué and severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi. Everyone became a red propagandist for the communiqué. They used various forms such as broadcasts, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and cultural performances to propagate, making the communiqué known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Based on the extensive propagation and study of the communiqué, the revolutionary committee decided to immediately launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They further reviewed their previous work and realized that the current obstacles to launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation were that some people thought the traitor Liu Shaoqi had already been permanently expelled from the party and all his positions within and outside the party had been revoked; the mine was also conducting "removing the old and taking in the new" work during the party rectification, and the class enemies had become dead tigers with nothing left to criticize. They addressed these active thoughts by first holding a mass rally to expose class enemies, where five class enemies, thoroughly investigated and exposed by the revolutionary workers' and families' part-time investigation teams, were publicly exposed on the spot. Immediately after that, they held a rally to denounce and expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents, further enlightening the broad revolutionary workers and families, arousing their deep hatred for the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, and raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Everyone further realized that not a single moment could be relaxed in the revolutionary criticism, and if we slackened, the enemy would attack. Not only must Liu Shaoqi, this piece of junk, be removed organizationally, but his entire revisionist ideology must also be thoroughly cleared from the minds of the broad revolutionary workers. Only in this way can the dictatorship of the proletariat be strengthened, and the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be consolidated and developed. On this basis, the leftist support personnel from the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine and the revolutionary committee formulated a new plan to carry out revolutionary criticism and launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They intensively studied the "Old Five Articles," severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist fallacies of "material incentives," "expert management," "technical leadership," and "production first," and intensively studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "Six Black Theories." At the same time, they organized a group of revolutionary workers and their families to enter departments and units that had not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, conducting in-depth and detailed investigations and research on unreasonable regulations and "old difficult problems," and proposing many reasonable reform plans. Now, under the impetus of the communiqué, the entire mine has once again seen a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

### 落实公报必须充分发动群众  木城涧煤矿革命委员会在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，放手发动群众，斗批改搞得轰轰烈烈

    落实公报必须充分发动群众
    木城涧煤矿革命委员会在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，放手发动群众，斗批改搞得轰轰烈烈
    本报讯　解放军驻木城涧煤矿毛泽东思想宣传队在帮助革命委员会宣传、贯彻、落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报中，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。他们在公报发表后，连续召开了庆祝公报发表和声讨、批判大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的群众大会，广泛、深入地宣传公报精神和毛主席的最新指示。在声势浩大的宣传、落实公报的群众运动中，全矿掀起了一个既是轰轰烈烈，又是扎扎实实的斗、批、改新高潮。
    是放手发动群众，造成一个广泛的群众运动来宣传、贯彻公报，还是满足于敲敲锣鼓庆祝一番就万事大吉了，这在木城涧煤矿革命委员会里有过一场思想斗争。公报发表后的第二天，按原先安排好的日程，是开生产会议，研究一九六九年的生产计划。大多数同志认为应该改变原来的日程安排，但也有少数人认为全矿职工已经敲锣打鼓庆祝过了，留几个人抓一抓就行了，生产会议不能拖延。针对这个问题，解放军驻矿支左人员和革委会全体成员一起认真学习、座谈八届十二中全会公报的伟大意义。通过学习，大家认识到，公报提出的战斗号召是当前一切工作的中心，必须立即组织全矿革命职工认真学习，深刻领会，迅速落实。
    思想认识统一后，他们就通宵达旦地召开全矿职工、家属庆祝大会。会后，全矿立即掀起了一个群众性的宣传八届十二中全会公报的热潮。从井上到井下，从工作面到家属区，处处都变成了宣传公报的阵地和狠批刘少奇的战场，人人成了公报的红色宣传员。他们利用广播、墙报、黑板报、文艺节目等多种多样形式进行宣传，使公报家喻户晓，深入人心。
    矿革委会在广泛宣传、学习公报的基础上，决定立即掀起一个斗、批、改的新高潮。他们进一步检查了前一段的工作，认识到目前掀起斗、批、改高潮的阻力，是有少数人认为刘少奇这个叛徒已经被永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外的一切职务；矿上在整党工作中也进行着“吐故纳新”工作，阶级敌人已经成了死老虎，没有什么东西可以再批了。他们针对这种活思想，首先召开了一次揪斗阶级敌人的群众大会，把革命职工、家属业余调查组经过深入、细致、全面调查研究挖出来的五个阶级敌人当场揪出来示众。紧接着又召开了声讨、揭发刘少奇及其代理人反革命罪行的大会，更进一步擦亮了广大革命职工和革命家属的眼睛，激发了大家对党内最大走资派刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，提高了职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，大家进一步认识到，一时一刻也不能放松革命大批判，我们松一松，敌人就攻一攻。不仅要从组织上清除刘少奇这个大废料，而且要在广大革命职工的思想上肃清他的一切修正主义思想。只有这样才能加强无产阶级专政，巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命伟大成果。在这个基础上，驻矿支左解放军和矿革委会制定了开展革命大批判的新计划，并且掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，大学“老五篇”，狠批刘少奇的“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”、“技术挂帅”、“生产第一”等修正主义谬论，大学《毛主席语录》和毛主席的最新指示，狠批刘少奇的黑“六论”。与此同时，他们还组织了一批革命职工和家属开进没有搞好斗、批、改的科室和单位，对不合理的规章制度和“老大难”问题，进行深入细致的调查研究，提出许多合理的改革方案。现在全矿在公报的推动之下，又出现了一个斗、批、改的新高潮。
