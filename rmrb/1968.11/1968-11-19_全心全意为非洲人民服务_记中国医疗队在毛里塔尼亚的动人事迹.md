According to the cultural cooperation agreement signed by the governments of China and Mauritania, the Chinese medical team arrived in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in April this year to work in the Seribabi and Kiffa regions in the south of the country. Over the past half year, these Chinese medical personnel, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, overcame various difficulties, and relieved the suffering of tens of thousands of Mauritanian people from illnesses, saving dozens of critically ill patients. The stories of the Chinese medical team saving patients have spread widely in Mauritania. Many people who were cured by the Chinese medical team gratefully told the Chinese medical personnel, "You are good doctors sent by Chairman Mao to serve the people of Mauritania. We thank the great leader Chairman Mao!"

	We Must Save the Mother and Child

	The Chinese medical team stationed in Seribabi had only been working for three days when a woman in labor was brought in from forty kilometers away. According to the diagnosis, there was a risk of both mother and child dying. At that time, the Chinese medical team had only a room of about twenty square meters for both internal and external medicine, and the obstetrics department had not yet started operations. Medicines and surgical instruments were also not yet prepared. What to do? The medical team immediately held an emergency meeting. Everyone decided to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao to wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world, and decided to admit the woman in labor, overcome all difficulties, and immediately perform a cesarean section to save the lives of the mother and child! Everyone immediately threw themselves into the intense battle. After quickly preparing everything, the surgery began. At that time, the weather was extremely hot, and the makeshift operating room was like a large steamer. Everyone was panting and sweating profusely. But everyone had only one belief: we must save both the mother and the child! With the close cooperation of local medical personnel, after an hour of struggle, the surgery was completed. The mother's condition was good, but the baby had difficulty breathing due to a long labor and mucus obstruction, requiring suction. But there was no suction tube. The obstetrician immediately grabbed a catheter next to her and sucked the mucus out of the baby's throat. "Wah!" The baby's clear cry broke the hot and tense atmosphere in the operating room.

	That night, the baby's grandmother spread the news all over the city. The news of the Chinese doctors performing a cesarean section to save the lives of the mother and child quickly spread throughout Seribabi City, and many people came to congratulate the Chinese medical team. A local medical worker excitedly said, "From the bottom of my heart, I thank the great leader Chairman Mao and the comrades of the Chinese medical team."

	Racing Through the Rain to Save a Child

	In July of this year, on a Sunday when it was pouring rain, the Chinese medical team stationed in Seribabi suddenly received a report from the clinic nurse on duty that a young woman had brought in a six-month-old critically ill child for treatment. Everyone heard this and, without resting, immediately rushed to the clinic in the rain. However, the young woman, seeing that her child was about to die, was afraid of dying in the clinic and had already taken the child away. The interpreter comrade did not say a word and chased after her. At this time, the rain was pouring down even harder, and the interpreter's shoes were stuck in the mud. He quickly caught up with the woman and, fearing that the child would get wet and worsen, immediately took off his own clothes to cover the child. The child's mother was deeply moved, and under the persuasion of the Chinese comrade, brought the child back to the clinic. The Chinese medical personnel saw that the child's breathing was weak, hands and feet were cold, nostrils were flaring, and the whole body was purple, very dangerous. At this moment, their thought was: as long as there is a glimmer of hope, we must save the child! The rescue began immediately: strengthening the heart, replenishing fluids, reducing fever, correcting acidosis, controlling infection, and so on. After a day and night of rescue and three days of careful nursing, the child turned from danger to safety.

	After a few days, the child's father, Rulerxin, came to the clinic with his son for a check-up. He happily played with his firstborn, repeatedly muttering, "Xinuowa, Xinuowa" (Chinese people). The Chinese medical personnel asked him, "Why are you muttering 'Xinuowa' to the child?" Rulerxin excitedly said, "His name is 'Xinuowa'!" He went on to say excitedly, "That day, my child was about to die, and it was the Chinese medical team sent by Chairman Mao that saved him. It was Chairman Mao who gave him life. So from the day he was saved, I changed his name to 'Xinuowa'." At this point, Rulerxin could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Restoring Sight to the Blind

	The Chinese medical team working in the Kiffa region temporarily had difficulty with housing, and the ophthalmology department had not yet started operations. However, about twenty percent of the patients who came for treatment every day were ophthalmology patients. These patients traveled from tens to hundreds of kilometers away, and some even brought their families and set up tents near the clinic waiting for treatment.

	Facing this situation, the Chinese medical personnel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, did not hesitate to actively find ways, take the initiative, and create conditions. They cleaned up a small warehouse of only eight or nine square meters, nailed a one-square-meter "examination table" (which also served as an instrument table) using a medicine box, and used a flashlight instead of an electric light. In this way, the ophthalmology department quickly started operations. It was in this small room that an average of seventy patients were treated every day, and thousands of ophthalmology patients were cured over a few months.

	There was an impoverished herder in his fifties who had been suffering from cataracts for more than twenty years and was completely blind. The Chinese medical personnel, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "in strategy, we must despise all enemies, and in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," carefully performed surgery on this old herder. After a month of treatment and nursing, the old herder not only no longer needed a cane to walk but could also use a bucket to draw water from the well himself. His wife, who had been frowning all day because her husband had become blind, was now happy and laughing, sometimes even singing and dancing. The old herder himself, after regaining his vision, would see the Chinese medical personnel and tightly grasp their hands, saying, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, for sending us such good doctors!"

	Advancing the Implementation of Mobile Medical Services

	Originally, it was planned that the medical team would implement mobile medical services at least six months later because the medical team needed a period to familiarize themselves with tropical diseases; at the same time, language barriers would make it difficult to work in the countryside. However, soon after the medical team started working in the cities of Kiffa and Seribabi, it was found that many patients had walked from eighty or ninety kilometers away, and after arriving, the problem of food and accommodation was also difficult to solve. All this made everyone think of the vast countryside that needed more medicine, so they studied the brilliant instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on medical work again. Everyone unanimously agreed that mobile medical services should be started ahead of schedule. Thus, everyone quickly learned a few commonly used phrases in the local language, and two weeks after the team members stationed in Seribabi started working, three people were sent to a village eighty-five kilometers away for mobile medical services without an interpreter. In three days, they treated 127 cases of measles and 121 other patients. The local people were very moved to see the Chinese medical team bringing medicine boxes to the countryside to treat diseases. The success of this first attempt made the entire medical team further realize the significance of mobile medical services and also strengthened their confidence in mobile medical services. From then on, mobile medical services became an important institution of the Chinese medical team. Now, the Chinese medical teams stationed in Seribabi and Kiffa send people to the countryside on a rotating basis every month. Every time the medical team arrives at a village, they are warmly welcomed by the local people. An old farmer who was cured of a neurosis by the Chinese medical team during a mobile medical service said to the Chinese medical personnel, "Chairman Mao is truly great! He is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also cares for the broad masses of people all over the world! He knew in Beijing that we Africans lack medicine and sent us such good doctors! I am very, very grateful to Chairman Mao!"

	As the work of the medical team progressed, more and more people came for treatment. In Kiffa, many tents were set up around the Chinese medical team's station for people who came to see a doctor, making it the most bustling place in the city. Those who came to the Chinese medical team for treatment were not only residents from cities and villages hundreds of kilometers away, but also from the capital Nouakchott. Some people took several days by car, and some rode camels for eight whole days. Facing this situation, all members of the Chinese medical team decided to further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly serve the people of Africa.

### 全心全意为非洲人民服务——记中国医疗队在毛里塔尼亚的动人事迹

　　全心全意为非洲人民服务
　　——记中国医疗队在毛里塔尼亚的动人事迹
    根据中国和毛里塔尼亚两国政府签订的文化合作协定，中国医疗队于今年四月来到毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国，在这个国家南部的塞里巴比和基法两个地区工作。半年来，这些经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国医务人员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，克服种种困难，为数万名毛里塔尼亚人民解除了疾病的痛苦，抢救了数十名垂危的病人。中国医疗队救治病人的动人故事，在毛里塔尼亚广为流传。许多被中国医疗队治好病的人感激地对中国医务人员说：“你们是毛主席派来为我们毛里塔尼亚人民服务的好医生。我们感谢伟大领袖毛主席！”
    一定要救活她们母女俩
    驻在塞里巴比的中国医疗队刚开始工作的第三天，从四十公里外送来一位难产的初产妇，根据诊断，有母婴双亡的危险。当时，中国医疗队只有一间二十平方米左右的房间供内、外科使用，妇科还没有开诊，药品、手术器械也还没有准备好……。怎么办？医疗队立即召开了紧急会议，大家决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务，决定把这个产妇收下来，克服一切困难，立即做剖腹产，以抢救母婴生命！于是，大家立即投入了紧张的战斗。在迅速作好各项准备后，手术就开始了。当时，天气酷热，临时建立的手术室简直象个大蒸笼，每个人气喘吁吁，汗流浃背。但大家只有一个信念：一定要把大人、孩子都救活！在当地医务人员的密切配合下，经过一个小时的奋战，手术完成了。母亲情况良好，然而婴儿因产程过长和痰塞而发生窒息现象，需要吸痰。但又找不到吸痰管。妇科医生立即抓起放在身旁的导尿管，将婴儿喉中的痰吸出来，“哇”的一声，婴儿清脆的哭声打破了手术室闷热而紧张的空气。
    当晚，婴儿的祖母就在市内到处报喜。中国医生剖腹取胎抢救母婴生命的消息很快传遍了塞里巴比城，许多人跑来向中国医疗队热烈祝贺。一位当地的医务人员激动地说：“我从内心里感谢伟大领袖毛主席，感谢中国医疗队的同志们。”
    冒着大雨接回要抢救的小孩
    今年七月间的一个星期天，正下着倾盆大雨，驻在塞里巴比的中国医疗队突然接到卫生所值班护士的报告，说有一位青年妇女抱来一个六个月的病情危重的患儿就医。大家一听，顾不得休息，立刻冒着大雨赶到卫生所。但是，那位青年妇女看到孩子就要不行了，怕死在卫生所，已经把孩子抱走了。医疗队的翻译同志二话没说，拔腿就追。这时，雨越下越大，翻译同志的鞋也陷进了泥里，他急忙赶上这位妇女后，怕孩子淋雨病情加重，立即将自己的衣服脱下给小孩盖好。孩子的母亲深受感动，在中国同志的劝说下，将孩子又抱回了卫生所。中国医务人员看到，孩子呼吸微弱，手脚发凉，鼻翼搧动，浑身呈紫色，十分危险。这时，他们的想法是：只要还有一线希望，就一定要把孩子救活！抢救立即开始：强心，补液，退烧，纠正酸中毒，控制感染等等。经过一昼夜的抢救和三天的细心护理，患儿完全转危为安。
    过了几天，孩子的爸爸鲁勒辛抱着儿子来卫生所检查时，高兴地逗着自己的头生子，嘴里不停地叨念着：“希努瓦，希努瓦”（中国人）。中国医务人员听了就问他：“你为什么对着孩子念叨‘希努瓦’？”鲁勒辛激动地说：“他的名字就叫‘希努瓦’！”他接着又激动地说道：“那天我的孩子眼看就要死了，是毛主席派来的中国医疗队救活了他，是毛主席给了他生命。所以从他被救的那天起，我就给他改名叫‘希努瓦’了。”说到这里，鲁勒辛情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    使盲人重见光明
    驻在基法地区工作的中国医疗队由于房子暂时有困难，眼科一时没有开诊，但是，每天就诊的病人中约有百分之二十左右是眼科病人。这些病人从几十公里以至几百公里外远途跋涉而来，有的甚至带着家属在卫生所附近安下帐篷等候医疗。
    面对这种情况，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国医务人员，毫不犹豫地积极想办法，自己动手创造条件，把一间只有八、九平方米的小库房打扫干净，用药箱钉了一个一平方米的“诊察桌”（同时也是器械台），没有电灯用手电筒代替……。就这样，眼科就很快开诊了。就是这个小房间，平均每天接待着七十名左右的病人，几个月来治好了数千名眼科病人。
    有一位五十多岁的贫苦牧民，患“白内障”二十多年了，双目完全失明。中国医务人员遵照伟大领袖毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，大胆细心地给这位老牧民动了手术。经过一个月的治疗和护理，这位老牧民不但走路不再用拐棍，而且能用水桶自己打井水了。他的老伴过去因为丈夫成了盲人，成天愁眉不展，现在丈夫重见光明，又能劳动了，高兴得有说有笑，有时甚至又歌又舞。老牧民本人，自从视力恢复后，一见到中国医务人员，就双手紧握着中国医务人员的手说：“感谢毛主席给我们派来的好医生！”
    提前实行巡回医疗
    原来设想，医疗队实行巡回医疗，至少要在半年以后，因为医疗队对热带病需要一个熟悉过程；同时，语言不通，下乡后无法工作。可是，当医疗队在基法、塞里巴比两城开始工作后不久，就发现不少病人是从八、九十公里以外步行来的，来到后吃住问题又很难解决。这一切，使大家想到广大农村更需要医药，于是再次学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于卫生工作的光辉指示。大家一致认为，应当提前开始巡回医疗。于是，大家突击学会了几句看病常用的地方语，驻在塞里巴比的队员们开始工作后的两个星期，便分出三个人，不带翻译，到八十五公里外的一个村庄巡回医疗。他们在三天内，就治疗了麻疹病人一百二十七人，其他病人一百二十一人。当地群众见到中国医疗队带着药箱下乡来治病，十分感动。这第一次尝试的成功，使全医疗队更加提高了对巡回医疗意义的认识，也更加坚定了对巡回医疗的信心。从此，巡回医疗就成了中国医疗队的一项重要制度。现在，驻在塞里巴比和基法的中国医疗队，每月都派人轮流下乡。医疗队每到一个村子都受到当地群众的热烈欢迎。有一位经中国医疗队在巡回医疗中治好了神经官能症的老农民对中国医务人员说：“毛主席真伟大！他不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，他还关心着全世界的广大人民！他在北京就知道我们非洲人民缺医少药，给我们派来了这样的好医生！我非常非常感谢毛主席！”
    随着医疗队工作的开展，来就医的人越来越多。在基法，中国医疗队驻地周围安扎了不少来看病的人的帐篷，成为全城最热闹的地方。找中国医疗队治病的，不仅有来自几百公里以外的城镇和乡村的居民，还有来自首都努瓦克肖特的。有的人坐了几天汽车，还有的整整骑了八天骆驼。面对这种情景，中国医疗队全体人员决心要进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，全心全意为非洲人民服务。　　新华社记者
