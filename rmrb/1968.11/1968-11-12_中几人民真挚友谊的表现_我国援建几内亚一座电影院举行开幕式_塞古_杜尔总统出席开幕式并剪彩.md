	Marcel Matot, Guinea's Secretary of State for the Interior, spoke at the inauguration.

This once again shows that the people of Guinea, who have broken free from the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, can fully build their country with their own hands and the rich resources of their homeland."

	He said: "Following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong, we have always believed that it is our unshakable internationalist duty to provide assistance within our capabilities to the people of Guinea who are fighting against imperialism. He went on to say: "The 700 million people of China, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and more resolutely and effectively support the revolutionary struggles of oppressed peoples and nations, to fulfill their proletarian internationalist duty."

	He expressed his firm belief that the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea will be increasingly consolidated and strengthened.

    几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔出席了开幕式并剪彩。
    在科纳克里的几内亚民主党全国政治局成员和政府部长以及几内亚各界人士近两千人参加了开幕式。
    中国驻几内亚大使馆临时代办林秉南和在几内亚工作的中国工程技术人员的代表也参加了开幕式。

    几内亚负责内政的国务秘书马赛尔·马托在开幕式上讲了话。他代表塞古·杜尔总统以及几内亚人民和政府，向光荣的中国革命的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，向英勇的中国人民和中国政府，表示敬意和最真诚、最热烈的感谢。他指出：“这座电影院的建成，是体现真挚而忠实的友谊的事实之一，是中几两国人民反帝反殖斗争中的战斗的兄弟情谊的生动的具体表现。”
    马赛尔·马托最后高呼：“中—几友谊和合作万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    林秉南在讲话时说：“‘十一月八日电影院’的开幕，是中几两国人民之间的友谊的又一表现。这再次说明，挣脱了帝国主义和殖民主义枷锁的几内亚人民，完全能够用自己的双手和本国的丰富资源建设他们的祖国。”
    他说：“按照毛泽东主席的教导，我们始终认为：在力所能及的范围内向进行反帝斗争的几内亚人民提供我们的援助，是我们不可推卸的一种国际主义的义务。”他接着说：“经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加坚决地和有效地支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，以履行他们的无产阶级国际主义义务。”
