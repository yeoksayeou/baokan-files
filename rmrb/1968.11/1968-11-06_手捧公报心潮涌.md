    Hands Holding the Bulletin, Waves of Emotion Surge
    Workers from Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory, Zhang Baosheng and Yang Junqing, beat the big drum with all their might, making it resonate through the sky. They sing loudly, "The bulletin of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee has been published. The great news has reached the factory."

    The veteran worker holds the bulletin, his heart blooming with joy. Tears of excitement stream down his face. Celebrating victory, he wants to tell Chairman Mao many heartfelt words: It is your "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster that pointed out the victorious direction for the Cultural Revolution. Look at today, the country's mountains and rivers are all red. The triumphant songs echo far and wide. Holding the bulletin, one can't get enough of it. Every word and sentence speaks to our hearts. We firmly support Chairman Mao's wise decisions, and we will bury the Black Headquarters of Liu Shaoqi thoroughly...

    Before the veteran worker finishes speaking, a young man steps onto the platform, his heart full of passion and blood surging. Holding the Little Red Book, he shouts loudly, "The more we study the bulletin, the more strength we have. The red sun shines brightly in our hearts. We will follow Chairman Mao's instructions. The revolutionary burden is on our shoulders! We will grasp the revolution and promote production. We will fight this battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will spur on the galloping horse, fearing neither strong winds nor big waves."

    Holding the bulletin, our spirits soar high. The bulletin stirs up waves of enthusiasm. Resolutions are posted one after another on the walls. We workers will forever follow Chairman Mao. We will overcome any obstacles, even mountains of knives and seas of fire. We will make the sun shine red over the entire globe. The working class will hold the universe in our hands!
