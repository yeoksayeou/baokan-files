On the evening of November 1, the loudspeakers broadcast the bulletin of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and immediately, Tsinghua Garden was filled with a scene of joyous celebration. "Heartily hail the publication of the bulletin of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party!" "Resolutely support the Party Central Committee in expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" The slogans, firecrackers, and drumbeats merged into a massive wave of sound, echoing through the night sky of Tsinghua Garden. Over twenty thousand workers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, revolutionary teachers and students, and Red Guards, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags, and waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," joyously gathered from all corners of the campus to the lawn square, enthusiastically cheering and singing with unbounded joy.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Radio Department, although they had helped the nearby commune with farm work all day, immediately forgot their fatigue upon hearing the broadcast of the special joyous news of the bulletin of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They all stood tall and joined the parade.

"The bulletin spoke the words we have long wanted to say," many Red Guards exclaimed, their hearts surging with emotion. Looking back on the more than two years of the Cultural Revolution, every victory was achieved under the guidance of Chairman Mao and in the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought. Following Chairman Mao is victory. Student Bian Jincheng of the Department of Industrial Equipment, while listening to the broadcast, shed tears of excitement. He recalled the early days of the movement, when under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, they raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and strongly opposed Liu Shaoqi, driving Wang XX out of Tsinghua Garden, thus rapidly advancing the Cultural Revolution in Tsinghua Garden. However, in the later stages of the movement, due to not closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, they made mistakes. It was the workers' propaganda team sent by Chairman Mao that helped them return to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Bian Jincheng thought more and more, and he decided to forever follow Chairman Mao, accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become an intellectual welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The publication of the bulletin was like a strong east wind, bringing great encouragement and strength to the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and revolutionary teachers and students. "Closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and march forward bravely!" became their common voice. Red Guard Liu Yumei of the Civil Engineering Department, before the publication of the bulletin, heard that she was to participate in the core group work of cleaning up class ranks in her department, feeling the burden was heavy and having a sense of difficulty. But when she heard the bulletin point out that it is necessary to continue to "fully mobilize the masses and seriously do a good job in cleaning up class ranks, and root out the handful of counter-revolutionaries mixed among the masses," she realized that her previous thoughts were wrong. She said, "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is mainly seen in action. Chairman Mao wants us to thoroughly clean up class ranks, so I should actively take on heavy responsibilities."

The east wind of the bulletin is blowing strongly, and it will surely bring a new high tide to the struggle, criticism, and transformation in Tsinghua Garden!

    公报说出了我们心里话
    十一月一日晚上，广播喇叭传出了党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报，顿时，清华园里呈现出一派欢腾景象。“热烈欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表！”“坚决拥护党中央把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党！”“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”的口号声、鞭炮声、锣鼓声，汇成了一股巨大的声浪，响彻清华园的夜空，两万多名工人毛泽东思想宣传队、革命师生和红卫兵小将，高举毛主席画像和红旗，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，欣喜若狂地从校园的四面八方，汇集在草坪广场上，热烈欢呼，纵情歌唱。
    无线电系的革命师生，虽然白天帮助附近公社干了一天农活，但是他们一听到广播喇叭传出党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报这一特大喜讯时，马上忘记了劳累，个个精神抖擞地加入了游行队伍。
    “公报说出了我们久久想说的心里话。”许多红卫兵小将，此时此刻，心潮澎湃。回顾两年多来文化大革命的战斗历程，每一个胜利都是在毛主席他老人家的指引下，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下取得的。紧跟毛主席就是胜利。工物系学生边金城，一边听着广播，一边流着激动的泪水。他回想运动初期，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，大造了刘少奇的反，把王××赶出了清华园，使清华园的文化大革命迅速向前发展。可是，在运动后期，由于没有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，犯了错误。是毛主席派来的亲人工人宣传队帮助他们回到毛主席革命路线上来。边金城越想越激动，他决心永远紧跟毛主席，接受工农兵的再教育，做一个工农兵欢迎的知识分子。
    公报的发表，犹如一股强劲的东风，它给工人毛泽东思想宣传队和革命师生带来了巨大的鼓舞和力量。“紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进！”成了他们的共同心声。土建系红卫兵小将刘玉梅，在公报发表前，听说要她参加系里清理阶级队伍核心小组工作，感到担子重，有畏难情绪。但她听到公报指出，必须继续“充分发动群众，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把混在广大群众中的一小撮反革命分子挖出来”时，她认识到了原来的思想不对头。她说：“对毛主席忠不忠主要是看行动。毛主席要我们把清理阶级队伍搞彻底，我就应该主动地拣重担子挑。”
    公报的东风在劲吹，它必将给清华园里的斗批改带来一个新的高潮！
