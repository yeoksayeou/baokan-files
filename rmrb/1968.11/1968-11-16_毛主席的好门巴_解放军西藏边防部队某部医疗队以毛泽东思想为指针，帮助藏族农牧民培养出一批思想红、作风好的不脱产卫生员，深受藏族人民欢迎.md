A medical team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet border defense forces, using Chairman Mao's thoughts as their guide, has helped Tibetan farmers and herdsmen train a group of non-full-time medical personnel who are politically red and have good work styles. They are deeply loved by the Tibetan people.

The medical team stationed in the Tibetan Plateau, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people," frequently goes deep into the agricultural and pastoral areas near their station to prevent and treat diseases for their Tibetan compatriots. After arriving in the agricultural and pastoral areas, they deeply felt that the place was vast and sparsely populated. When Tibetan compatriots fell ill, they had to travel a long way to find a doctor for treatment, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, they decided to hold short-term training classes to train a group of non-full-time medical personnel for Tibetan farmers and herdsmen.

The trainees are all children of liberated farmers and herdsmen. They study while participating in production labor. The training content emphasizes proletarian politics, using two-thirds of the time to organize trainees to study and apply the "Three Articles" (i.e., "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"), arming the trainees' minds with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they invite farmers and herdsmen who have suffered deeply to give class struggle education courses. The teachers and trainees together recall bitterness and sweetness, and together criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Through learning, the trainees established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people and studied technology diligently and seriously. Trainee Soilang Dunzhu, in order to master the injection technique, practiced on his own body. In this way, after three months of training, these trainees can treat common diseases.

This batch of non-full-time medical personnel trained by the border defense medical team, after returning to their production posts, do everything according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Medical personnel Juba once found a patient fainted on a hillside during a patrol. He carried the patient back to the village from the hillside in one breath and took care of him until he regained consciousness. When the patient expressed his gratitude, he said, "You should thank the great leader Chairman Mao. It is Chairman Mao who taught me to do this." Once, the masses led a horse and asked medical personnel Qunzong to see a patient. She said, "Chairman Mao told me to serve the people, not to ride the people's horse." Saying this, she walked to the masses' home on foot. The farmers and herdsmen liked such medical personnel very much. They excitedly said, "The soldiers' doctor is Chairman Mao's good doctor. The soldiers trained for us are also Chairman Mao's good doctors."

　　“毛主席的好门巴”
　　解放军西藏边防部队某部医疗队以毛泽东思想为指针，帮助藏族农牧民培养出一批思想红、作风好的不脱产卫生员，深受藏族人民欢迎
    驻守在西藏高原上的人民解放军边防部队某部派出的医疗队，以毛泽东思想为指针，帮助藏族农牧民培养出一批思想红、作风好的不脱产卫生员，深受藏族人民欢迎。
    这个医疗队遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，经常深入到驻地附近的农牧区为藏族同胞防治疾病。他们到农牧区后，在巡回治疗中，深深感到这里地广人稀，藏族同胞患了病，要走很远的路才能找到医生诊治，十分不便。于是，他们就决定举办短期训练班，为藏族农牧民培养一批不脱产的卫生员。
    训练班的学员都是翻身农牧民的子女，他们一边参加学习，一边参加生产劳动。训练内容坚持突出无产阶级政治，用三分之二的时间组织学员活学活用“老三篇”，用毛泽东思想武装学员的头脑。在这同时，还请苦大仇深的农牧民上阶级教育课，教员和学员一起进行忆苦思甜，一起对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇展开革命大批判。通过学习，学员们树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，钻研技术刻苦认真。学员索朗顿珠为了掌握打针技术，就在自己的身上试验。就这样，这些学员经过三个月训练，都能治疗一般常见疾病。
    这一批由边防部队医疗队培养的不脱产卫生员，在回到生产岗位以后，处处按照毛主席的教导办事。卫生员各巴一次在巡诊途中，发现一个病人晕倒在山坡上。他一口气把病人从山坡上背回村里，一直照顾到病人清醒。当病人对他表示感激时，他说：“你应该感谢伟大领袖毛主席，是毛主席教我这样做的。”有一次，群众牵了马，请卫生员群宗去看病。她说：“毛主席叫我为人民服务，没有叫我骑人民的马。”说着，她就徒步走到群众家里。农牧民非常喜欢这样的卫生员，他们激动地说：“解放军的门巴（医生）是毛主席的好门巴，解放军给我们培养出来的也是毛主席的好门巴。”　（据新华社拉萨十五日电）
