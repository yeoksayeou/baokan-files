Title: The Superiority Has Already Been Demonstrated

The suggestions made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu have expressed the sentiments of us rural primary school teachers. In our commune, the poor and lower-middle peasants, following the great leader Chairman Mao's wise instructions to "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," have since October of this year implemented comprehensive management of primary schools. Practice has proven that this is very effective.

Firstly, it has broken the old system of the revisionist educational line. In the past, the central school managed the branch schools, the urban managed the rural, the large managed the small, the old managed the new, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had no say. Our school has long wanted to shorten the school system and reform education. However, in the end, it remained just empty talk. After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the schools, they abolished the central school system, abolished the six-year primary school system and the "three-three" system of junior high school, and established five-year and seven-year continuous education systems (primary school with attached junior high school classes).

Secondly, it has kicked out the teaching content that is detached from rural reality and promotes feudal, capitalist, and revisionist ideas. After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the schools, they proudly declared: "Our children will not learn this garbage. We will learn the great truth—Mao Zedong Thought. We will use Chairman Mao's works as the main textbooks, make class struggle the main course, and base everything on productive labor." This has realized Chairman Mao's great thought that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor."

Thirdly, teachers and community members receive the same work points, filling in the gap between rural teachers and the poor and lower-middle peasants. The brigade running the school has sparked a great struggle between "public" and "private" in the teachers' minds. At first, I thought, my health is not good, if I get work points based on labor, it will be less than my original salary, how will I get home? I even thought about where to store the grain. I kept thinking, but I couldn't get out of the "private" circle. The soldiers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and we together started Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The poor and lower-middle peasants talked about their past sufferings of not having control over education, which deeply educated me. The poor and lower-middle peasants asked: "Do you think power is important, or money is important?" Chairman Mao's teachings and the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants made me realize that I should focus on "power" and not on "money." This is a big issue in the struggle between the two classes and two lines. In the past, on Sundays or after school, I would go to the mountains to enjoy the scenery, avoid manure, and not care about the brigade's production, lacking the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now it's different; I carry the manure basket every day and pick up manure whenever I see it.

The time since the public primary school was transferred to the brigade to run is short, but it has already shown great superiority.

　　优越性已经显示出来了
    侯振民、王庆余两位同志的建议说出了我们农村小学教师的心里话。我们公社贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的英明教导，从今年十月份开始，对小学实行了全面管理。实践证明，这样作好得很。
    首先，打破了修正主义教育路线的旧体制。过去中心校管分校，是洋的管土的，大的管小的，旧的管新的，贫下中农过问不得。我们学校早就想缩短学制，改革教育。可是，到头来还是一句空话。贫下中农管理学校后，取消了中心校，取消了小学六年制和中学的“三三”制，办起了五年一贯制和七年一贯制（小学附设初中班）的学校。
    其次，把脱离农村实际，宣扬封、资、修的教学内容一脚踢开。贫下中农管理学校以后，气高志昂地说：“咱孩子不学这些臭垃圾，要学伟大的真理——毛泽东思想。以毛主席著作为主要教材，以阶级斗争为主课，以生产劳动为基础。”这样就实现了毛主席关于“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大思想。
    第三，教员和社员一样记工分，填平了农村教师与贫下中农间的一道沟。大队办学，引起教师头脑中“公”与“私”的大决战。开始时，我想，自己身体较差，按劳取酬记工分比原工资低怎么办？回家没路费怎么办？就连分粮没地方放都想到了。转呀转，出不了“私”字的圈子。解放军、贫下中农和我们共同办起了毛泽东思想学习班，贫下中农谈以前没掌教育大权的苦，深深地教育了我。贫下中农问：“你们看权重要，还是钱重要？”毛主席的教导，贫下中农的话，使我认识到要着眼“权”，不能着眼“钱”，这是在两个阶级、两条路线斗争中站在那一边的大问题。过去，星期日或每天放了学，就跑到山上看风景，见了粪绕着走，不关心队里的生产，缺乏贫下中农的感情。现在就不同了，自己每天背起粪筐，见粪随时拣。
    公办小学下放到大队办的时间虽短，但已显示了极大的优越性。
