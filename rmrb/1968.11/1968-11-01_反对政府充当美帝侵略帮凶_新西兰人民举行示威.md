Just as New Zealand Prime Minister Keith Holyoake concluded his activities in the United States, South Korea, and South Vietnam and returned to Wellington on November 31st, approximately one hundred citizens of the New Zealand capital, Wellington, staged a demonstration at the airport. They protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and condemned the New Zealand government for acting as an accomplice to U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

As soon as Holyoake stepped out of the airport, the demonstrators jeered and laughed at him. Among the large banners held by the demonstrators were slogans such as "U.S. Out of Vietnam Immediately!" and "Victory to the Vietnamese People!" When Holyoake quickly got into a car in an attempt to slip away, some demonstrators held up banners reading "No New Zealand Sons for U.S. Dollars" blocking his path, making it impossible for his car to escape. When Holyoake arrived at the radio station to prepare a speech for the nation, he encountered another group of demonstrators. During his speech, the number of demonstrators gathered outside the radio station continued to grow. Holyoake finally had to hurriedly leave the radio station amidst a chorus of jeers and boos.

    反对政府充当美帝侵略帮凶
    新西兰人民举行示威
    新华社惠灵顿三十一日电　正当新西兰总理霍利约克结束了他在美国、南朝鲜和南越的活动在三十一日回到惠灵顿的时候，新西兰首都惠灵顿的市民约一百人在机场上举行了示威，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，谴责新西兰政府充当美帝侵越的帮凶。
    霍利约克刚刚走出机场，示威者就向他发出嘘声和嘲笑声。示威者手中高举的一些巨大的横幅上写着：“美国立即滚出越南！”“胜利属于越南人民！”当霍利约克赶快钻进汽车企图溜走时，一些示威者举起写着“没有一个新西兰子孙要美元”字样的横幅拦住去路，使他的汽车一时无法溜掉。当霍利约克来到广播电台，准备向全国发表讲话时，他遇到了另一批示威者。在他讲话期间，聚集在广播电台前面的示威者越来越多。霍利约克最后不得不在一片讥笑和嘘声中慌忙地从电台溜走。
