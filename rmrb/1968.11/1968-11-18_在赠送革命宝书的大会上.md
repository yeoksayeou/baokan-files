At the ceremony of donating revolutionary treasures, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfeng Production Brigade were all beaming with joy. Holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, they sang "The East Is Red" as they went on stage to receive the revolutionary treasures, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," sent by the revolutionary committee.

Ma Jiuhai, a 75-year-old poor peasant, also sang "The East Is Red" as he went on stage to receive the revolutionary treasures. Tears of excitement welled up in the old man's eyes. He held up Mao Zedong's Red Book above his head with his hands, which had labored for many years, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

No one expected that Old Ma would speak. He said, "Comrade Lin Biao teaches us, 'Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, making revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought.' Without Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Old Ma! In the past, I worked for landlords, rich peasants, and princes for over forty years. I got up at dawn and worked till late at night, bending over day and night, but still couldn't eat or wear enough. When the Japanese devils occupied Kangping, they demanded grain, money, and labor. With no choice, I went to a prince's estate in Inner Mongolia and worked for the prince. There, I married a female slave. Her sufferings were even greater than mine..."

As he spoke, Old Ma's tears flowed down his cheeks. At this moment, a young man led the crowd in shouting, "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debt!" "Never forget the Communist Party after liberation, always think of Chairman Mao in happiness!" Then Old Ma continued excitedly, "Since the Communist Party came, Chairman Mao led us poor and lower-middle peasants to rise up and make revolution. Only then did Old Ma live a good life and walk on the socialist road. Life gets better and better. The poor peasants in the brigade all help me. Old Ma can't live without the Communist Party, without the red sun Chairman Mao, and without the poor peasants. I am over seventy years old, my legs and feet are not convenient, and my eyes are blurry. But I want to learn from the young people and ask them to help me study Chairman Mao's quotations, learn a little, and use a little. Liu Shaoqi, that big bad guy, didn't let us read Chairman Mao's books and wanted us to go back to the old road, suffer twice. This is absolutely not allowed! We poor peasants, if we don't read Chairman Mao's books, whose books will we read?! Chairman Mao's books are the magic weapon for the poor to rise up and liberate themselves. Although I don't know a single character, I will read Chairman Mao's books all my life. Whoever opposes me reading Chairman Mao's books, I will overthrow them! Old Ma will follow the leader Chairman Mao and revolutionize to the end."

The old man's speech was drowned out in thunderous applause.

　　在赠送革命宝书的大会上
    在东风大队赠送革命宝书《毛泽东选集》的大会上，贫下中农个个喜气洋洋，擎着毛主席的画像，唱着《东方红》，走上台去双手接过革命委员会送来的革命宝书。
    七十五岁的贫农姜四海也唱着《东方红》走上台去，接受革命宝书。老人眼里闪着激动的泪花，用他那双劳动了多年的手，把毛主席的红书举过头顶，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    谁也没有想到，姜老大爷发言了。他说：“林副主席教导我们说：‘大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。’没有毛主席，没有毛泽东思想，就没有我老姜头！过去我给地主、老财、王爷扛了四十多年活。起五更，爬半夜，黑夜白天不直腰地干，还是吃不上，穿不上。日本鬼子占了康平，要粮要钱抓劳工。没法子，我到了内蒙古一个王府，给王爷扛活。在那里，我和一个女奴结了婚。她那苦比我受的还多。……”说着说着，姜大爷的眼泪刷刷地流下来了。这时，一个小伙子领头高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“翻身不忘共产党，幸福想念毛主席！”接着姜大爷兴奋地说下去：“自从共产党来了，毛主席领导咱贫下中农翻身闹革命，我老姜头才过得好了，走上了社会主义道路，日子越过越好，队里贫下中农穷哥们都帮助我。我老姜头离不开共产党，离不开红太阳毛主席，离不开贫下中农穷哥们。我七十多岁了，腿脚不灵便，眼睛看啥都模糊。但我要向小青年学习，请他们帮助我学习毛主席语录，学一点，用一点。刘少奇这个大坏蛋，不让我们读毛主席的书，想让我们走回头路，受二遍苦，这是万万办不到的！我们贫下中农不读毛主席的书，读谁的书？！毛主席的书，是穷人翻身闹解放的法宝，我虽然一个大字不识，但我就是要读毛主席的书，读一辈子。谁反对我读毛主席的书，我就打倒谁！我老姜头要紧跟领袖毛主席，永远革命到底。”老人的发言被淹没在雷鸣般的掌声中。
