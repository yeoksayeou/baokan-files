Japanese revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals have recently held meetings in various places to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which has profound historical significance.

At a recent meeting of a Mao Zedong Thought study group in Tokyo, Okada Haruko said, "At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward in China, Chairman Mao issued the great document 'Bombard the Headquarters,' correctly pointing out the direction of the revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have thoroughly exposed the true face and crimes of Liu Shaoqi, expelling him from the Party forever. This will strengthen this proletarian dictatorship state of China, making China an invincible bastion of world revolution."

She said, "The unprecedented struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads that has been unfolding in China over the past two years has given the people of the world great experience and lessons. Now, the people of the world revolution further understand what is true Marxism-Leninism, what is revisionism, what is the revolutionary road, and what is the counter-revolutionary road."

A worker who actively works among the workers, Numakawa, said at the meeting: "Chairman Mao is a truly great Marxist-Leninist. Chairman Mao relies on the broad masses of the people, fully mobilizing the boundless revolutionary power of the broad masses of the people. He said, "We must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making every effort to combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution."

Printer worker Kuni Hiro said: "Seven hundred million Chinese people are closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, completing the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. What a magnificent and magnificent scene! He said, "Now, the people of Japan and the people of various countries in the world are launching a powerful revolutionary struggle storm. We must throw ourselves into the blazing revolutionary struggle fire for tempering."

The participants in the meeting finally expressed their heartfelt congratulations on the great victory of the Chinese people. They said: "Your victory is also our victory. The achievements of the expanded Twelfth Plenum have given us great encouragement. We must firmly grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry out our revolutionary struggle."

Young workers and students in Osaka, who are on the front lines of the anti-American patriotic struggle, recently held a symposium to enthusiastically celebrate the victory of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was held under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Mao.

Worker Kawamura said: "The expanded Twelfth Plenum declares that after more than two years of intense struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victory, and the complete downfall of the capitalist-roaders in power headed by Liu Shaoqi has been pronounced. The communiqué of the plenum has given great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world and has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries."

Another worker, Yoshimoto, said, "At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued the famous document 'Bombard the Headquarters.' Chairman Mao trusted the masses and encouraged the masses to participate in this struggle. After more than two years of struggle, the broad revolutionary masses in China have thoroughly overthrown the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. This is a remarkable thing. The victory of the expanded Twelfth Plenum is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

Student Miyano said, "Japanese youth must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and more resolutely throw themselves into the blazing flames of the anti-American patriotic struggle. At the same time, they must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and carry the struggle through to the end until the victory of the Japanese revolution."

Young worker Inoue said: "Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'As long as we seriously achieve the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt.' We must implement this teaching and carry out this teaching. Our struggle has a bright future."

　　日本革命工人农民学生集会欢呼我十二中全会取得伟大胜利
　　中国成为世界革命的坚强堡垒
　　文化大革命使世界革命人民进一步认识到什么是真正的马列主义，什么是修正主义
    新华社十三日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本各地的革命工人、农民、学生和知识分子，最近纷纷举行集会，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会所取得的具有重大历史意义的伟大胜利。
    在东京的一个毛泽东思想学习小组最近举行的集会上，冈田春子说，在中国无产阶级文化大革命波澜壮阔地开展的时候，毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》这个伟大的文献，正确地指出了革命的航向。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，中国人民彻底揭露了刘少奇的真面目和他的罪行，把刘少奇永远开除出党。这将加强中国这个无产阶级专政的国家，使中国成为世界革命的战无不胜的堡垒。
    她说，两年多来在中国展开的规模空前的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的伟大斗争，给了全世界人民以极大的经验教训。现在世界革命人民进一步认识到什么是真正的马克思列宁主义，什么是修正主义，什么是革命道路，什么是反革命道路。
    一位在工人中进行工作的积极分子沼冈在会上说：毛主席是真正伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席依靠广大人民群众，充分调动广大人民群众的无穷无尽的革命力量。他说，我们必须认真活学活用毛主席的著作，尽最大的努力把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同日本革命的具体实践相结合起来。
    印刷工人国广说：七亿中国人民紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，正在完成伟大的斗、批、改任务，这是多么宏伟壮丽的景象。他说，现在日本人民和世界各国人民正在掀起一个声势浩大的革命斗争风暴，我们必须把自己投身于熊熊的革命斗争烈火中进行锻炼。
    参加会议的人们最后表示衷心地祝贺中国人民所取得的伟大胜利。他们说：“你们的胜利也是我们的胜利。扩大的十二中全会的成就给了我们极大的鼓舞。我们要牢牢掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，坚决开展我们的革命斗争。”
    正在反美爱国斗争前线开展斗争的大阪青年工人和学生最近举行了座谈会，热烈欢呼在毛主席亲自主持下召开的中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会取得的胜利。
    工人川村说：扩大的十二中全会宣告了经过两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的激烈斗争，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利，宣判了以刘少奇为首的走资本主义道路当权派的彻底完蛋。全会公报给予全世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞，给予美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击。
    另一位工人吉本说，在无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，毛主席发表了著名的文献《炮打司令部》，毛主席相信群众，放手发动群众起来参加这场斗争。经过两年多的斗争，中国广大革命群众彻底打倒了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。这是一件了不起的事情，扩大的十二中全会的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    青年学生宫野说，日本青年必须遵循毛主席的教导，排除万难，不怕牺牲，更加坚决地投身于反美爱国斗争的熊熊烈火中去，同时必须团结广大的工农群众，把斗争进行到底，直到取得日本革命的胜利。
    青年工人井上说：“伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：‘只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。’我们必须贯彻这一教导，执行这一教导。我们的斗争前途是光明的。”
