In the reactionary film "Liu Shaoqi Visits Indonesia," the giant portraits of Liu Shaoqi and his stinking wife Wang XX frequently appear. Liu Shaoqi is smug and self-satisfied, showing a "well-deserved" expression. Throughout his entire "visit," he does not mention the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, attempting to belittle Chairman Mao's lofty prestige among the Indonesian people and defame the profound influence of Mao Zedong Thought among the Indonesian people. Liu Shaoqi's wolfish ambitions are indeed vile!

Even more intolerable is Liu Shaoqi's public and malicious attacks on our country's three red banners in front of the reactionary right-wing military leaders of Indonesia, claiming that "the scope is too broad" and "the economy is imbalanced," and so on. This tone is not in harmony with the anti-China chorus of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries?

The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the three red banners personally established by our great leader Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of these three red banners, which shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, our people have displayed the revolutionary spirit of hard work, self-reliance, and striving for progress. We have overcome the tremendous difficulties caused by the sabotage of the Soviet modern revisionist clique against our economy and have conquered the unprecedentedly severe natural disasters of three consecutive years. Thus, we have achieved great victories in socialist construction. This is a fact that everyone can see. Why does Liu Shaoqi insist on ignoring the facts and talking nonsense? The reason is that different trees bear different flowers, and different classes speak different words. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Liu Shaoqi's wanton attacks on the great three red banners fully expose him as a thorough counter-revolutionary!

Liu Shaoqi, this dog that bows down to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, openly opposes Chairman Mao. This is inseparable from his sinister plot to usurp the Party and the state. Khrushchev achieved his goal of usurping the Party and the state by fiercely attacking Stalin. Liu Shaoqi's frenzied opposition to our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, both domestically and internationally, is also to realize his wolfish ambition to usurp the Party and the state.

However, the wheel of history will never turn back. Liu Shaoqi's opposition to our great leader Chairman Mao is like an ant shaking a tree or a mantis blocking a chariot. No matter how black the crow's wings are, they cannot block the radiance of the red sun!

Our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructs us: "Chairman Mao is the highest leader of our Party, and Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal universal truth. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the whole Party will condemn them, and the whole nation will denounce them." We must respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle the accounts of the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and throw Liu Shaoqi into the garbage heap of history, making him stink forever!

    乌鸦的翅膀再黑遮不住红太阳的光辉
    解放军战士　周松耐
    在反动影片刘少奇《访问印度尼西亚》里，多次出现刘少奇和他的臭老婆王××的巨幅画像。刘少奇对之得意洋洋，露出“受之无愧”的神色。他在整个“访问”过程中，根本不提伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，妄图贬低毛主席在印尼人民中的崇高威望，诋毁毛泽东思想在印尼人民中的深远影响。刘少奇的狼子野心，何其毒也！
    更令人不能容忍的是刘少奇在印尼反动右派军人头目面前，公然恶毒地攻击我国的三面红旗，胡说什么：“摊子铺得太大”啦，“经济失调”啦，等等。这种腔调，不是和帝、修、反的反华大合唱同出于一个“谱”吗！
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自树立起来的三面红旗。我国人民在这闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的三面红旗的指引下，发扬了艰苦奋斗、自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，克服了由于苏联现代修正主义集团对我国经济进行种种破坏所产生的巨大困难，战胜了历史上空前严重的连续三年的自然灾害，从而获得了社会主义建设的伟大胜利。这是有目共睹的事实，刘少奇为什么要睁着眼睛不看事实，胡说八道？原因就在于什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”刘少奇肆意攻击伟大的三面红旗，正好暴露出他是一个十足的反革命派！
    刘少奇这个拜倒在帝、修、反脚下的哈叭狗，明目张胆地反对毛主席，这是和他的篡党篡国的罪恶阴谋分不开的。赫鲁晓夫就是通过大反斯大林来达到其篡党篡国的卑鄙目的的。刘少奇在国内外疯狂反对伟大领袖毛主席、疯狂反对毛泽东思想，也正是为了实现他篡党篡国的狼子野心。
    但是，历史的车轮是永远不会倒转的。刘少奇反对伟大领袖毛主席，不过是蚍蜉撼树，螳臂挡车。乌鸦的翅膀再黑，遮不住红太阳的光辉！
    我们敬爱的副统帅林副主席指示我们：“毛主席是我们党的最高领袖，毛泽东思想是永远的普遍真理。谁反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，全党共诛之，全国共讨之。”我们一定响应林副主席的伟大号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清算大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，把刘少奇批倒、批臭，永远扔进历史的垃圾堆！
