In the vast rural areas of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Fengxian counties in Shanghai's suburbs, almost every commune, production brigade, and production team has organized Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams. These teams, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have firmly occupied the rural art propaganda front, driving all the filthy things of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism off the stage, and increasingly playing the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

These art propaganda teams are mostly composed of young people in their twenties from poor and lower-middle peasant families. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, they use singing, dancing, telling revolutionary stories, performing plays, drawing propaganda posters, putting up blackboard newspapers, and showing slides to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought penetrate deeper into the countryside. Under the guidance and leadership of the Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams, people from the age of four or five to those in their sixties and seventies all sing Chairman Mao's quotations and dance revolutionary dances, forming their own propaganda teams.

The Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams coordinate with the brigade's central work, combine their own team's active thoughts, and promptly perform programs to propagate, doing thorough ideological work. They go deep into the production teams to perform for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Every performance venue is always packed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praise their propaganda performances as "accurate, lively, reflective, and vivid," "talking about things around us, singing about familiar people, visible, tangible, learnable, and watching the play boosts our spirits."

The Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams insist on small-scale amateur propaganda performances. They do not build stages, do not wear costumes, do not sell tickets, do not set up backdrops, and do not pay attention to lighting. They go wherever they are needed and fight there. When the community members rest in the fields, the propaganda team members pull out a string instrument and beat a bamboo clapper, and they can propagate. Before and after meetings, in the fields, the propaganda team seizes every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

The propaganda teams regard promptly and effectively propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their most glorious combat mission. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they, with full political enthusiasm, promptly and decisively use various forms to widely propagate, making Chairman Mao's instructions known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

These rural Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams were tempered and grown in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the leading cadres of the communes and production brigades in Shanghai's suburbs increasingly deeply realized that to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, they must seize the pen and do well in ideological work. They thoroughly criticized the bourgeois art line, seized the art propaganda power from the bourgeois elements in the old folk art galleries and old writers' associations, selected outstanding children from poor and lower-middle peasant families, established and strengthened the Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams, and rapidly occupied the rural art propaganda front. The communes and brigades also dispatched the first or second in command to personally lead, vigorously promoting the ideological revolutionization of the team members. Through holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they educated the team members to use Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a weapon, to use Chairman Mao's teachings of completely and thoroughly serving the people, to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and to bravely become pioneers of the three great revolutionary movements. Under the direct education of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the team members always maintained the character of the working people. During the busy seasons of summer and autumn, they worked in the fields with everyone during the day and took turns to propagate in various production teams at night, never complaining. Many team members said: "Perform heroes on stage, learn from heroes and be heroes off stage, and leading by example is the best propaganda." "If you don't study Mao Zedong Thought well yourself, you will feel your heart pounding, your face turning red, and your voice choking when you go on stage to propagate."

　　上海郊区松江金山奉贤三县农村普遍组织毛泽东思想文艺宣传队
　　用毛泽东思想牢牢占领农村文艺宣传阵地
    宣传队配合中心工作，结合群众的活思想，及时排演节目，热情宣传毛泽东思想。广大贫下中农赞扬宣传队的演出：“说的是身边事，唱的是熟悉人，看得见，摸得着，学得到，看了戏就能鼓干劲。”
    新华社上海十七日电　在上海郊区松江、金山和奉贤三县的广大农村，几乎每个公社、大队和生产队，都组织起了毛泽东思想文艺宣传队。这些宣传队以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，牢牢地占领了农村文艺宣传阵地，把封建主义、资本主义、修正主义等乌七八糟的东西统统赶下了文艺舞台，越来越大地发挥着“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的战斗作用。
    这些文艺宣传队大都由二十来岁的贫下中农子女组成。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，用唱歌、跳舞、讲革命故事、演戏、画宣传画、出黑板报、放幻灯等文艺形式，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想在农村更加深入人心。在毛泽东思想文艺宣传队的带动和辅导下，从四、五岁的娃娃到六、七十岁的老人都唱起毛主席语录歌，跳起革命舞，组织起了宣传队。
    毛泽东思想文艺宣传队配合大队的中心工作，结合自己队里的活思想，及时排演节目进行宣传，深入细致地做思想工作。他们深入到生产队为贫下中农演出，每次演出场地上总是挤得满满的。广大贫下中农赞扬他们的宣传演出“抓得准，写得活，反映快，演得生动”，“说的是身边事，唱的是熟悉人，看得见，摸得着，学得到，看了戏就能鼓干劲”。
    毛泽东思想文艺宣传队坚持搞小型的业余宣传演出。他们不搭台，不化装，不卖票，不设布景，不讲究灯光，走到那里就战斗到那里。社员在田头休息时，宣传队员一拉胡琴一打竹板，就能宣传。会前会后、场角田头，宣传队见缝插针，抓紧一切时机宣传毛泽东思想。
    宣传队把迅速及时地宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示看成是最光荣的战斗任务。毛主席的最新指示一发表，他们就怀着满腔政治热情，雷厉风行地利用多种多样的形式，广泛进行宣传，使毛主席的指示家喻户晓，深入人心。
    这些农村毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，是在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼成长起来的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，上海郊区广大贫下中农和公社、生产大队的领导班子，越来越深刻地认识到，要巩固无产阶级专政，必须掌好笔杆子，做好意识形态的工作。他们彻底地批判了资产阶级的文艺路线，从旧群众艺术馆、旧作家协会的资产阶级分子手中夺回了文艺宣传大权，选拔贫下中农的优秀子女，建立和健全了毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，迅速占领了农村文艺宣传阵地。公社和大队还选派第一把手或第二把手亲自挂帅，大抓狠抓宣传队队员的思想革命化。他们通过举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班等办法，教育宣传队员以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》为武器，用毛主席教导的完全、彻底为人民服务的精神，斗私批修，勇当三大革命运动的闯将。在广大贫下中农的直接教育下，宣传队员们始终保持着劳动人民的本色。在三夏、三秋大忙季节，他们白天和大家一样劳动，晚上轮流到各生产队宣传，从不叫苦。许多宣传队员说：“台上演英雄，台下要学英雄、做英雄，以身作则是最好的宣传。”“自己不学好毛泽东思想，上台宣传心要跳，脸要红，喉咙也不响。”
