The U.S. imperialists, disregarding the strong opposition of the broad Arab nations, are hastening to plot the arming of their tool of aggression in the Middle East, Israel, with "Phantom" supersonic military aircraft.

This plot was revealed after U.S. President Johnson announced on October 9 that he would negotiate with Israel to sell supersonic military aircraft. On October 22, after Israeli Foreign Minister Eban met with Johnson, he formally began negotiations with U.S. Secretary of State Rusk. Subsequently, officials from the U.S. Department of Defense and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. discussed the details.

The *New York Times* reported, after two weeks of "negotiations," that the U.S. had not only agreed in principle to sell Israel 58 "Phantom F-4" jet fighter-bombers but also agreed to provide an additional 24 light attack aircraft. Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Rabin said on November 11 that these "Phantom" aircraft would be delivered to Israel before the new U.S. president takes office on January 20 next year.

The U.S. has already begun training personnel to operate the "Phantom" aircraft for Israel. According to the Jordanian *Constitutionalist*, about 100 Israeli Air Force pilots and technical personnel left for the U.S. on October 30 to receive accelerated training in operating "Phantom" aircraft. Previously, according to the UAR's *Al-Ahram*, Israeli pilots had already received training in flying "Phantom" aircraft in Iran. Since the U.S.-Israel aggression against Arab countries last June, the U.S. has been continuously supplying weapons and ammunition to Israel. Last October, the U.S. provided Israel with 48 "Skyhawk" fighter jets. This June, it was decided to provide Israel with "Hawk" missiles.

The U.S. providing "Phantom" aircraft to Israel has been long in the making and has long been tacitly agreed upon. Johnson chose to announce this on the day after Israeli Foreign Minister Eban proposed a so-called nine-point "peace plan" to solve the Middle East problem at the United Nations General Assembly on October 8. One of the main purposes of this is to use it to pressure Arab countries to accept the U.S. and Soviet revisionist plot to force Arab countries to surrender to Israel in the name of a "peaceful solution" to the Middle East problem.

The U.S. imperialists' provocative and blackmailing actions of providing "Phantom" aircraft to their tool of aggression, Israel, have aroused strong condemnation and opposition from Arab countries. A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry recently pointed out that this is "a new act of aggression by the U.S. against the Arab nation." A spokesman for the UAR government said that the U.S. action would encourage Israel to "further invade the Arabs." The Iraqi Foreign Minister accused the U.S. of forming an "unholy alliance" with Israel. The government of South Yemen said in a protest note to the U.S. government that this step is a conspiracy by the U.S. and Israel to implement an expansionist and hegemonic foreign policy against Arab countries. The Sudanese government also protested to the U.S. over this.

### 对阿拉伯人民的又一挑衅和讹诈　美帝公然策划用“鬼怪式”飞机武装以色列　阿拉伯各国政府强烈谴责美帝的侵略阴谋

　　对阿拉伯人民的又一挑衅和讹诈
　　美帝公然策划用“鬼怪式”飞机武装以色列
　　阿拉伯各国政府强烈谴责美帝的侵略阴谋
    新华社十三日讯  美帝国主义不顾广大阿拉伯国家人民的强烈反对，正加紧策划用“鬼怪式”超音速军用飞机武装它在中东地区的侵略工具以色列。
    这一阴谋是在美帝头子约翰逊十月九日宣布要同以色列谈判出售超音速军用飞机以后透露出来的。十月二十二日，以色列外交部长埃班在会见约翰逊后正式同美国国务卿腊斯克开始了谈判，接着由美国国防部和以色列驻美大使馆的官员商谈细节问题。
    《纽约时报》在双方“谈判”进行了两周之后报道，美国不仅已经在原则上同意卖给以色列五十八架“鬼怪F—4式”喷气战斗轰炸机，而且答应另外提供二十四架轻型攻击机。以色列驻美大使拉宾还在十一月十一日说，这些“鬼怪式”飞机将在明年一月二十日美国新总统就任前交给以色列。
    美国已经着手为以色列训练操纵“鬼怪式”飞机的人员。据约旦《宪政报》报道，大约有一百名以色列空军的飞行员和技术人员在十月三十日从拉特维夫前往美国，接受操纵“鬼怪式”飞机的速成训练。在这以前，据阿联《金字塔报》揭露，已经有以色列飞行员在伊朗接受驾驶“鬼怪式”飞机的训练。自从去年六月美以侵略阿拉伯国家的战争以来，美国源源不断地向以色列提供武器军火。去年十月，美国就已经给了以色列四十八架“空中之鹰式”战斗机。今年六月，又决定向以色列提供“隼式”导弹。
    美国向以色列提供“鬼怪式”飞机是酝酿已久、早有默契的。而约翰逊挑选在以色列外长埃班十月八日在联合国大会抛出所谓解决中东问题的九点“和平方案”的第二天，宣布这件事，其主要目的之一是用以向阿拉伯国家施加压力，迫使它们接受美帝和苏修正在幕后合谋炮制的迫使阿拉伯国家向以色列屈膝投降的所谓“和平解决”中东问题的骗局。
    美帝国主义向其侵略工具以色列提供“鬼怪式”飞机的挑衅和讹诈行径，激起了阿拉伯国家的强烈谴责和反对。叙利亚外交部发言人最近指出，这是“美国对阿拉伯民族采取的新的侵略行为”。阿联政府发言人说，美国的行动将鼓励以色列“对阿拉伯人进行更进一步的侵略”。伊拉克外交部长指责美国同以色列结成“不神圣的同盟”。南也门政府在给美国政府的抗议照会中说，这个步骤是美国和以色列合谋对阿拉伯国家实行扩张主义和强权外交政策。苏丹政府也就此向美国提出了抗议。
