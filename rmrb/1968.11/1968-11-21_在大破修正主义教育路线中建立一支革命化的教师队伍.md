Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key to educational reform lies in the teachers." In the practice of the educational revolution, we deeply feel that in the struggle against the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, building a new type of teacher corps and achieving the thought revolutionization of teachers is the key to realizing the proletarian educational revolution.

Our commune has fourteen schools and sixty-nine teachers. Among them, eleven are old intellectuals from before liberation, and fifty-eight are teachers trained by old schools after liberation. Among the teachers, there are also landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as bad elements with serious political and historical problems. These bad elements, under the protection of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, have occupied the school lecterns and become the "teachers" of the poor and lower-middle peasants' children. They use their stolen power to exercise cultural dictatorship over our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Most of the teachers from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds are students trained by schools after liberation. Due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, after becoming teachers, they do not care about agricultural production and do not get close to the poor and lower-middle peasants. As some poor and lower-middle peasants have said, they do not go out of the school gate, do not enter the production team gate, are not close to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and do not ask about the team's affairs. Our commune also has a group of teachers from the mass-run schools who have undergone labor tempering, are selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and implement the work-point system. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise them, saying, "Their pants have no seams, they sit on benches without cushions, they have dirt on their bodies, and their palms have calluses." However, these teachers are said by some people to be "inexperienced, low-level, uneducated, and rustic."

We deeply realize that establishing a revolutionary teacher corps is a sharp class struggle. Without thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, we cannot thoroughly expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, cannot quickly raise the political awareness of teachers, cannot thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, and the management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants will become an empty talk.

We held four sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes attended by all teachers, representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, student representatives, and the People's Liberation Army. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we launched a revolutionary criticism and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants found the fundamental reason hindering the thought revolutionization of teachers: First, bad elements have infiltrated the teacher corps. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, these people were not originally ours and cannot do things for us. If we do not eliminate these bad elements, there is the danger of losing power. Second, the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi has dug a ditch and built a wall between teachers and the poor and lower-middle peasants, obstructing the combination of teachers with the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, teachers' salaries were paid by the state, so teachers themselves had a sense of superiority and became people who were detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants, detached from labor, and detached from reality, neither in heaven nor on earth. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Teachers who earn money are different from us. They don't have a speck of dirt on them, they don't push the millstone or pull the mill, and they eat rice and flour every month. Some people just eat our food and don't work hard for us. They were blinded by Liu Shaoqi." Teacher Zhao Fenglan said at the criticism meeting: "I am a child from a poor family. After becoming a teacher, as soon as I received my salary, I felt I had a status, and it seemed that labor and combining with the masses were not related to me. I forgot about class bitterness and forgot about the laboring people. This time, changing from salary to work points, I initially couldn't understand it and felt I was losing out. Later, under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I truly realized that this is not a matter of whether to earn a few more yuan, but a big issue of which path to take." Relying on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we thoroughly and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, greatly raising the teachers' awareness of the two-line struggle. They realized that only by clearing away the obstacles to implementing the work-point system in their minds could they thoroughly go to the poor and lower-middle peasants, participate in productive labor, thoroughly change their worldview, and always stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and be revolutionary to the end.

Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle and the work of cleaning up the class ranks, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants selected twenty-seven people from among the active learners of Chairman Mao's works, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and educated youth who had participated in labor for more than a year to supplement the teacher corps, injecting new blood.

The entire commune, starting from this year's autumn harvest distribution in the countryside, has assigned teachers to production teams by household and begun to implement the work-point system. Teachers' remuneration is calculated based on the work-point standard of the upper-middle labor force among the poor and lower-middle peasants, using the average work points of the production brigade, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, using the "Dazhai-style" scoring method, decided by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the production brigade where the teachers are located. In addition, several specific measures have been stipulated to effectively solve some practical difficulties of the teachers.

    在大破修正主义教育路线中建立一支革命化的教师队伍
    毛主席教导我们：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”在教育革命实践中，我们深深感到在大破叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线中，建设一支新型的教师队伍，实现教师思想革命化，是实现无产阶级教育革命的关键。
    我们公社共有十四所学校，六十九名教员，其中解放前留下的旧知识分子十一名，解放后由旧学校培养出来的教员五十八名。在教师中，也混进了地、富、反、坏、右分子和有严重政治历史问题的坏人。这些坏人在叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线保护下，霸占学校讲台，成了贫下中农子女的“先生”。他们利用窃取的权力，在文化上对我们广大贫下中农专了政。
    大多数贫下中农出身的教师，是解放后从学校培养出来的学生，由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，当了教师后，不关心农业生产，不接近贫下中农。正象有的贫下中农所说的，他们校门不出，队门不入，对贫下中农不亲，队里的事不问。我们公社也有一支经过劳动锻炼，由贫下中农选派、实行工分制的民办学校教师，贫下中农称赞他们“穿裤子没有线，坐凳子不用垫，身上带泥点，手掌磨起茧。”但是，这些教师却被一些人说成“资历浅，水平低，没知识，土里土气”。
    我们深刻认识到，建立一支革命化的教师队伍，是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。不深入开展革命大批判，就不能把叛徒刘少奇的修正主义教育路线搞臭，就不能迅速提高教师的政治觉悟，资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象就不能彻底结束，贫下中农管理学校就成了一句空话。
    我们举办了四期由全体教师、贫下中农代表、学生代表和解放军参加的毛泽东思想学习班，以毛泽东思想为武器，对反革命修正主义教育路线展开了革命大批判。通过革命大批判，贫下中农找到了阻碍教师思想革命化的根本原因：一是教师队伍中混进了坏人。贫下中农说，这些人本来就不是我们的人，根本就不能为我们办事。不清除这些坏人，就有失权的危险。二是叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，给教师和贫下中农之间挖了一条沟，修了一堵墙，阻碍了教师与贫下中农相结合。过去，教师工资是国家发，这样，教师本身就有一种优越感，成了脱离贫下中农、脱离劳动、脱离实际的，上不着天、下不着地的人。贫下中农说：“挣钱的教员，就是和咱不一样，人家身上泥点都不沾，不推碾子不拉磨，每月照样吃大米白面。有的人就是吃咱们的饭，不给咱们尽心干，他们眼睁睁的让刘少奇给害了。”教师赵凤兰在批判会上说：“我是个贫苦家庭出身的孩子，当了教员后，工资一拿到手，就觉得有了本，什么劳动呀，什么同群众结合呀，好象与我关系都不大了。我忘记了阶级苦，忘记了劳动人民。这次由工资改成工分，起初想不通，认为吃亏了。以后在贫下中农的教育下，我才真正认识到，这不是要不要几个钱的问题，是关系到走什么路的大问题。”依靠广大贫下中农，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大大地提高了教师们两条路线斗争觉悟，认识到只有从思想上扫除实行“工分制”的障碍，才能彻底走到贫下中农中去，参加生产劳动，彻底改造世界观，永远站在毛主席的革命路线上，革命到底。
    经过革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作，广大贫下中农从学习毛主席著作积极分子、复员转业军人和参加一年以上劳动的知识青年中，选派了二十七人充实教师队伍，吸进了新鲜血液。
    全社从今年农村秋收分配起，教员按户定队，开始实行工分制。教员报酬是按贫下中农中上等劳力的工分标准，以大队平均分值计算，和贫下中农一起，用“大寨式”的评分方法，由教员所在大队的广大贫下中农讨论决定。此外，还规定了一些具体办法，切实解决教师的一些实际困难。
