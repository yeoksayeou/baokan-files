It was already midnight, and the meeting to celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive had just concluded at the Red Guards Brigade militia camp of Jiaoxie Commune in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province. As Cao Lianmei, the female cannon squad leader of the second platoon, walked home, she suddenly remembered that seven households in the production team, consisting of elderly people and many children, had not yet heard Chairman Mao's latest directive. She decided she must immediately convey it to them, truly embodying the spirit of "transmitting without delay, studying without omission."

Suddenly, Cao Lianmei felt her head throbbing and began to cough incessantly. She thought to herself, "I've been feeling unwell for several days now. It's better to rest early and convey the directive tomorrow."

"One's attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important question. We must focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought," echoed the words of Vice Chairman Lin in Cao Lianmei's mind. Indeed, what attitude one takes towards Chairman Mao's latest directive is a crucial test of loyalty. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, driven by his counter-revolutionary needs, fiercely opposed our active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. The more the enemy opposes, the more we must ensure that Chairman Mao's series of latest directives are transmitted without delay, executed without deviation, and followed without falling behind. She also recalled Steng Yuying from Hongjin Brigade, who, despite being paralyzed in three-quarters of her body, persisted in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist fallacies. Compared to Steng Yuying, her own headache and cough were nothing. With this in mind, Cao Lianmei immediately decided, along with two female militia members from the same village, to spread the latest directive that very night.

Cao Lianmei arrived at the home of the elderly poor peasant Ding Quanshou. Under the dim light of an oil lamp, an old man and a youngster sat attentively learning Chairman Mao's latest directive. Cao Lianmei taught a sentence, and Ding Grandpa read a sentence, over and over again, five times, ten times. Ding Grandpa, being old and hard of hearing, had poor memory, and even after teaching him thirty or forty times, he still couldn't remember. At this moment, pain, coughing, fatigue, and drowsiness all assailed Cao Lianmei. Seeing Cao Lianmei's poor health, Ding Grandpa felt guilty and said, "Lianmei, let's do this tomorrow."

Cao Lianmei firmly replied, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' We must also resolutely decide to memorize the latest directive. If we can't memorize it, we won't sleep." Seeing this female militia member, unyielding despite illness and fatigue, persistently conveying Chairman Mao's latest directive, Ding Grandpa's heart swelled with emotion. "Good girl," he said, "as long as you decide to teach, I will definitely learn it."

As time passed, Cao Lianmei taught with increasing vigor, and Ding Grandpa learned with increasing seriousness. Under Cao Lianmei's patient guidance, Ding Grandpa finally memorized Chairman Mao's latest directive.

When Cao Lianmei finished conveying the directive to the last household and walked out, the eastern sky had already begun to glow with a red hue.

　　灯下炼忠心
    已经是深夜十二点钟了，江苏省海安县角斜公社红卫大队民兵营召开的庆祝毛主席最新指示发表的大会刚刚结束。二排女炮班班长曹连梅，在回家的路上，忽然想起：生产队里还有七户年纪老、小孩多的社员没有听到毛主席的最新指示，应该立刻传达给他们，真正做到“传达不过夜，学习不漏人。”
    突然，曹连梅感到头脑发胀，咳嗽不停，她想到自己身体不舒服已经好几天了，还是早点休息吧，明天再传达也不迟。
      “对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”林副主席的这几句话，在曹连梅的耳边响起来。是啊！对毛主席的最新指示抱什么态度，就是对毛主席忠不忠的大问题。大叛徒刘少奇出于他反革命的需要，疯狂反对我们活学活用毛泽东思想。敌人越是反对，我们越要对毛主席的一系列最新指示传达不过夜，执行不走样，紧跟不掉队。她又想起洪泾大队的沈玉英同志，全身三分之二瘫痪了，还坚持宣传毛泽东思想，狠批刘少奇的修正主义谬论。自己这一点头疼、咳嗽又算得了什么。曹连梅想到这里，立即决定和同村的两个女民兵一起，连夜去宣传最新指示。
    曹连梅来到了老贫农丁全寿家，一老一少坐在煤油灯下，非常认真地学习起毛主席的最新指示。曹连梅教一句，丁大爷读一句，一遍两遍，五遍十遍。丁大爷年老耳聋，记忆力不好，一连教了三、四十遍，还是记不住。这时，头痛、咳嗽、疲劳、瞌睡一齐向曹连梅袭来。丁大爷看曹连梅身体不好，就很过意不去地说：“连梅，还是明天再教吧！”曹连梅坚定地说：毛主席教导我们：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们也要下定决心，把最新指示背下来，背不出来，就不睡觉。丁大爷看着眼前这个不顾疾病和疲劳坚持传达毛主席最新指示的女民兵，心情也十分激动地说：“好闺女，只要你下决心教，我就一定学会。”
    时间越来越晚，曹连梅越教越有劲，丁大爷越学越认真。在曹连梅的耐心教读下，丁大爷终于背出了毛主席的最新指示。
    曹连梅传达完最后一家走出来时，东方已经现出了一片红色的霞光。　群卒文
