The Rahman puppet clique is crazily arresting patriots. The reactionaries' persecution can only promote the people's revolution. The people of Malaya from all walks of life condemn the fascist atrocities of the Rahman clique.

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- In the face of the rapidly developing revolutionary struggle of the Malayan people, the Rahman puppet clique is in great panic. On November 9, it launched a sudden attack, crazily arresting anti-imperialist patriots and revolutionary masses in various parts of Malaya. This brutal act fully exposed the fascist reactionary nature of the Rahman puppet clique, which is a lackey of U.S. and British imperialism.

	According to reports from Singapore newspapers, the deputy prime minister of the "Malaysia" puppet government, Razak, admitted on November 10 that from November 9 to the early morning of November 10, more than 130 anti-imperialist patriots and revolutionary masses had been arrested in various parts of Malaya, with 53 people alone arrested in Johor State. Razak shouted that this arrest operation would continue until the "goal is achieved." However, according to reports from Singapore newspapers, many revolutionaries had already moved in time, thwarting the plot of the Rahman puppet clique.

	The Rahman puppet clique's brutal suppression of revolutionary forces has aroused strong indignation among the people of Malaya from all walks of life. Many mass organizations have issued statements, and political prisoners illegally detained in the Muar concentration camp held a meeting to condemn the fascist atrocities of the Rahman clique.

	To create counter-revolutionary public opinion for its fascist crimes, the Rahman clique issued a lengthy "white paper" on November 9, engaging in anti-communist and anti-people ranting and attacking China. The "white paper" appeared to be full of bluster but actually exposed the Rahman puppet clique's fear of revolutionary forces. It used "the Malayan Communist Party has never given up the use of violent means to seize power" as the pretext for this large-scale arrest. The "white paper" admitted that the revolutionary situation in Malaya had "undergo significant changes," and that revolutionary forces were "full of initiative," especially in rural areas where secret organizations were being established. Rahman himself also admitted on November 10 that the people's revolutionary forces had posed a genuine threat to the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia."

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The various persecutions inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The desperate struggles of the Rahman puppet clique cannot save them from their inevitable doom.

　　拉赫曼傀儡集团疯狂逮捕爱国者
　　反动派的迫害只能促进人民革命
    马来亚各界人民谴责拉赫曼集团的法西斯暴行
    新华社十四日讯　吉隆坡消息：在马来亚人民革命斗争迅速发展的形势下，拉赫曼傀儡集团十分惊慌，于十一月九日以突然袭击的方式，在马来亚各地疯狂逮捕反帝爱国志士和革命群众。这种残暴的行径，完全暴露了美英帝国主义的走狗拉赫曼傀儡集团的法西斯反动本质。
    据新加坡报纸报道，“马来西亚”傀儡副总理拉扎克十日供认，从十一月九日到十日早上为止，在马来亚各地被捕的爱国志士和革命群众已达一百三十多人，其中仅柔佛州就有五十三人被捕。拉扎克叫嚷，这次逮捕行动将继续进行，直到“达到目标时为止”。但是，据新加坡报纸透露，许多革命者已经及时转移，使拉赫曼傀儡集团的阴谋没有得逞。
    拉赫曼傀儡集团对革命的力量残暴镇压，激起了马来亚各界人民的强烈愤怒。许多群众团体发表声明，被非法拘禁在麻坡集中营的政治犯也举行大会，谴责拉赫曼集团的法西斯暴行。
    拉赫曼集团为了给它们的法西斯罪行制造反革命舆论，在十一月九日曾发表一个冗长的“白皮书”，大肆进行反共、反人民的叫嚣，并对中国进行攻击。这个“白皮书”表面上气势汹汹，实际上却暴露了拉赫曼傀儡集团对革命力量的恐惧。它把“马共从未放弃过用暴力手段夺取政权”作为这次大逮捕的借口。“白皮书”供认，马来亚的革命形势“起了重大改变”，革命力量“富有进取性”，“特别是在农村地区展开秘密组织”。拉赫曼本人十日也承认，人民革命力量已经对新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”，“具有真正的威胁”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。拉赫曼傀儡集团的疯狂挣扎，决不能挽救它们必然灭亡的命运。
