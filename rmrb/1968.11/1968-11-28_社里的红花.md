The red glow of the setting sun is draping the revolutionary village and the heroic children of the land in a crimson hue. The members of the Gleczari Village Agricultural Production Cooperative are returning from the fields and hills, their hearts filled with joy. The spirited girl, Lajiu, is particularly happy today. She hastily places her large sickle under the olive tree in the courtyard and dashes into the house. The silver-haired old mother, Mi Ta, is engrossed in reading Comrade Enver Hoxha's works on the veranda. Seeing her daughter Lajiu's beaming face, she immediately thinks of her elder daughter, Laini. She feels fortunate to have these two heroic daughters and proud of the glorious Albanian Labor Party and people!

"Mother! Please get ready. Laini's deeds have spread far and wide. In a few days, the girls will come to visit you. Mom, what should we say?"

Mi Ta pats Lajiu's shoulder excitedly and says, "I have nothing much to say. Everything we do is the result of the Party's education. You should read Comrade Hoxha's letter to me again!"

Lajiu, with a heart full of excitement, opens Comrade Hoxha's letter:

"Dear glorious mother Mi Ta:
Your letter informed me that your daughter Laini sacrificed herself like all the brave warriors who completed their missions. Your letter deeply moved me... Laini is no longer among you... But her name will forever be engraved in the hearts of all our heroic youth!"

Lajiu looks up at the radiant face of the heroic mother, and a sense of pride for the Party and the people wells up within her. She then raises her voice and reads aloud, "Our people and our Party are proud to have daughters like Laini, who work tirelessly, remain vigilant for the sake of the motherland, and are ready to sacrifice everything... Her exemplary deeds will forever inspire the youth to strive to build our beloved Albania into a garden of blooming flowers and an unshakable fortress to defeat all enemies."

Mi Ta and Lajiu's faces light up with happiness. Every word from Comrade Hoxha brings back many memories for the mother and daughter...

In the fields of the Gleczari Agricultural Production Cooperative, Laini grew like a blooming red flower. Although she did not yet have a party membership card, the great thoughts of the Labor Party and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha filled her young heart. People enthusiastically praised her: "Laini always appears as a revolutionary in every place, standing tall and marching towards the most difficult posts!"

The historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha ignited her boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. She was determined to fear no sacrifice and dedicate everything for the sake of the Party and the people.

Two years ago, in autumn, the Gleczari Agricultural Cooperative faced a new challenge: torrential rains fell without cease, and the members were anxious.

"The good harvest is not yet complete, and the rainy season has begun. After a year of hard work, the grains are almost ready to be stored, but the cursed autumn rain will rot them in the fields!" People murmured.

At this moment, Laini and another girl bravely rushed out of their homes towards the fields. "No matter how bad the weather, we must make it obey us! Can we sit at home waiting for the rain to stop?" Laini propagated to her young friends. Then, with a spirited stride, she entered the vast cornfield, which was bent by the wind and rain.

Despite the storm and mud, Laini and the girls chopped basket after basket of corn cobs, driving the ox carts, their hearts warmed by the golden corn being stored in the barn. Laini and the other youths' revolutionary spirit deeply moved the villagers, and soon men, women, old, and young all joined in. In just a couple of days, they rescued over a thousand piculs of corn from the heavy rain.

Laini was such a warrior who dared to fight against nature. She was not only like this in the commune but also actively participated in voluntary labor. Whenever the Party issued a call, she was the first to sign up, leading the youth to the places most needed by the motherland and with the most arduous tasks. At the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party, the Party issued the great call to "march towards the high mountains and hills, turn the barren mountains into fruit-bearing hills, and the steep cliffs into grain-producing plains." Laini, to help the distant mountainous areas quickly improve production and change their backward appearance, took a hoe in one hand and a shovel in the other, and marched with the youth volunteer labor army to the deep forests of Malakaster. There, she lived, ate, and worked with the local mountain people, establishing deep class feelings with the members of Kolapushi Commune. During the day, she worked alone, doing the work of two young men. At night, she propagated the Party's policies with the girls in the members' homes and was once again praised as a model for actively propagating the Party's policies. Sometimes she also organized the youth to listen to revolutionary veterans tell stories of the guerrilla warfare period, which made her further understand the history of the Albanian people's heroic struggle and their excellent tradition of fearing neither bloodshed nor sacrifice and daring to overcome all difficulties.

"The girl is simply the red flower of our mountain village! She will definitely become a member of the Labor Party!" The members enthusiastically praised Laini.

Pine trees and cypresses deeply root in the cold wind and snow, and revolutionary youth grow in the crucible of struggle. After laboring in the distant mountainous areas, Laini enthusiastically returned to Gleczari Village. The young men and women elected her as the team leader. Under her leadership, the production team became the advanced collective of the entire commune. The youth admired her, and she was always ready to take on the heaviest burdens and was a confidante of the youth.

One day, the youth had just returned from the fields when a leader hurriedly gathered everyone together and urgently said, "Girls! A military exercise is being conducted near our village. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries dare to bully us, but our brave mountain eagles are invincible to any enemy! We have the confidence to defeat all invaders with our guns and hoes! Now, the soldiers are rushing to build fortifications. A few young men suggested going to help our comrades-in-arms complete the fortifications as soon as possible. What do you think? Do you agree with this suggestion?" The girls unanimously and loudly replied, "For the Party and the people, we are ready to contribute everything at any time!" Thus, the organized young women, armed with hoes and shovels, marched to the soldiers' construction site, and a tense labor to build fortifications began in high spirits.

"We must complete the task!" The girls encouraged each other, saying, "We not only have to wield hoes and shovels like soldiers but also practice shooting." Laini was elected as the team leader. She organized all her comrades to important posts with her exemplary actions and fiery words. Every evening, during the award ceremony, her team always received praise. One day, the work did not progress as expected, and Laini's heart was heavy. After the award ceremony ended, the rest signal sounded, and the young men and women dispersed, chatting and laughing. Laini walked alone towards the construction site. Hoes, shovels, and bulldozers were piled up to the side. She swung the hoe and shovel and started digging the earth. Laini was such a tireless and calm girl. When people praised her for being so capable, she always said, "It's still far from enough! We young people are the pillars of the state and should strive for excellence!"

The heavy iron hoe in her hand flashed with silver light, and the bulldozer in front of her feet spun around frequently. "When the comrades come, I must finish it!" she said to herself. Thus, car after car of soil and stones were quickly transported to a distant place. The ground was almost level, but she was still not satisfied with herself, always wanting to find a way to do more and better, to boost her comrades' confidence in victory. "There's still time, I want to push a few more cars!" she whispered to herself. She pushed the car close to the cliff and fiercely swung the hoe to dig the earth. Just as she put down the hoe and was about to pick up the shovel to load the earth, suddenly, a loud roar echoed, and a large pile of soil and stones rolled down from the top of the cliff. She tried to dodge, but it was too late. Laini, the girl full of courage, holding the shovel and hoe in her hands, with boundless love for the Party and the motherland in her chest, heroically sacrificed herself on the battlefield.

A week after Laini's sacrifice, something even more moving happened in the unit where she had built fortifications: One day, someone lightly knocked on the door of the political commissar's office. The political commissar put down his documents, looked up, and saw a spirited girl standing in front of him. The girl's glowing eyes, brimming with youthful vitality, reminded the political commissar of Laini, who had sacrificed herself a few days ago.

She took a few steps forward, carefully examining everything around her. She did not know where to start, only saying, "I am... Laini!"

The political commissar was very surprised, staring in disbelief: "How, you are... Laini? Which Laini?"

"Laini Soderimaya!"

The political commissar took a few steps forward and found that the young girl was just like Laini, who had sacrificed herself not long ago, spirited and full of energy.

The girl continued, "Laini sacrificed herself for the mission, but as you and the other comrades said, she will forever live in our hearts! I am her sister, Lajiu. I came here to replace her battle position and take over her post!"

The next day, a new Laini appeared in the place where Laini had fought. This new Laini fought bravely with the people's army soldiers on the high mountain peaks.

Laini Soderimaya, like the fifteen-year-old female communist Shkuta Vata, had a short life, but she will live forever in the hearts of the children of the Land of Eagles; Laini Soderimaya, this vibrant red flower of the agricultural commune, will forever bloom in the fields of the mountain village. The heroic deeds show the glorious revolutionary fighting tradition of the Albanian people, the great communist style, and the sublime revolutionary heroism!

Ah! The great beacon of socialism in Europe, the indomitable people of the Land of Eagles! The surging waters of the Drin River will never cease, and the revolution will always have successors! The red baton is passed down from generation to generation, and the magnificent mountains and rivers will forever be spring!

    社里的红花
    金色的晚霞正在给革命化的山村和英雄的儿女们披红，格莱查里村农业生产合作社的社员们欢天喜地地从山坡和田野里走回村来。朝气蓬勃的莱秋姑娘今天显得分外高兴，她急急忙忙地把大镰刀放在园里的橄榄树下，一个箭步就闯进屋里了。坐在凉台上的头发斑白的老母亲微塔正在聚精会神地阅读霍查同志的著作，看到女儿莱秋这样眉开眼笑的神色，立刻想起了大女儿莱妮。她为有这两个英雄的女儿感到幸福，更为光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民感到自豪！
    “妈妈！您快准备一下吧，莱妮姐姐的事迹已经传遍了。过几天姑娘们会来访问您的。妈，您说我们讲些什么好呢？”
    微塔抚摸着莱秋的肩膀，兴奋地讲道：“我没有啥好讲，咱们所做的每一件事，都是受党教育的结果。你还是再把霍查同志的来信念给我听听吧！”
    莱秋怀着激动的心情打开了霍查同志的来信：
    “亲爱的光荣的母亲微塔：
    您来信告诉我，说您的女儿莱妮象所有为完成任务而献身的勇士一样地牺牲了，您的来信使我非常感动……莱妮现在已经不在你们中间了……但是，她的名字将永远铭刻在我们所有的英雄的青年的心里！”
    莱秋抬头望望满面红光的英雄母亲，一种为党为人民而骄傲的感情顿时涌上心头，于是便放开嗓门，大声念道：“我们的人民和我们党为有象莱妮这样孜孜不倦地从事劳动，为了祖国的利益提高警惕，准备献出一切的儿女、山鹰感到骄傲……
    “她的典型事迹将永远鼓舞青年为把我们可爱的阿尔巴尼亚建成一个百花烂漫的大花园和战胜一切敌人的磐石而从事斗争和劳动建设。”
    微塔和莱秋的脸上露出幸福的微笑，霍查同志的每一句话都使母女两人想起很多往事……
    在格莱查里农业生产合作社的土地上，莱妮象一朵盛开的红花茁壮成长。尽管她还没有一个劳动党党员的党证，可是劳动党的伟大思想和霍查同志的教导却充满了她年轻的心灵。人们热情地夸奖她：“莱妮总是以一个革命者的姿态出现在一切地方，昂首挺胸地奔向最困难的岗位！”
    劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议和霍查同志的教导唤起了她无比的革命豪情，她决心不怕任何牺牲，为了党和人民的利益献出自己的一切。
    两年前的秋天，格莱查里农业社面临着一个新的困难：滂沱的秋雨一直下个不停，社员们十分心焦。
    “大好的庄稼还未收获完毕，雨季就开始了。辛苦一年，五谷眼看就要进仓，可是该诅咒的秋雨要把到手的谷物烂在地里了！”人们纷纷议论着。
    就在这时，莱妮同另外一位姑娘勇敢地冲出家门奔向田野。“天气再坏，也得听我们使唤！难道我们能坐在家里等待天晴吗？”莱妮对青年朋友们这样宣传。然后就意气风发地跨到了辽阔的被风雨吹打得弯了腰的玉米地里。
    冒着暴风雨，脚踏泥浆，莱妮和姑娘们劈下一筐筐的玉米棒，赶着牛车，心里暖洋洋，金黄的玉米拉进了仓。莱妮和其他青年的革命干劲深深地感动了乡亲们，于是男女老少一起出动了，没两天，就从大雨中抢获了一千多公担玉米。
    莱妮就是这样一个敢于同大自然搏斗的战士。她不仅在社里如此，而且还积极地参加义务劳动。只要党一发出号召，她准是第一个报名，率领青年们奔向祖国最需要、任务最艰巨的地方。在劳动党第五次代表大会上，党提出了“向高山丘陵进军，把荒山变成花果山，峻岭变成米粮川”的伟大号召。莱妮为了帮助遥远的山区迅速提高生产，改变落后面貌，一手拿镐，一手拿锹，跟青年义务劳动大军浩浩荡荡地来到了玛拉卡斯特的深山密林里。在这里，她和当地山民同吃同住同劳动，同科拉普希的社员们建立了深厚的阶级感情。白天，她一个人干的活顶两个小伙子，夜晚，与姑娘们一起到社员家里宣传党的政策，再一次被评为积极宣传党的方针政策的标兵。有时她还组织青年们听革命老前辈讲述当年游击战争时期的革命故事，这使她更加进一步了解了阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇斗争的历史和不怕流血牺牲，勇于排除万难的优秀传统。
    “这姑娘简直是咱们山村的红花啊！将来一定会成为一名劳动党党员！”社员们这样热情地称赞莱妮。
    苍松翠柏在寒风暴雪中深深扎根，革命青年在斗争的熔炉里锻炼成长。在遥远的山区劳动之后，莱妮兴致勃勃地回到了格莱查里村，小伙子和姑娘们选她当队长。在她的率领下，生产队成了全社的先进集体。青年们钦佩她，她总是勇于抢重担子挑，而且是青年们的知心朋友。
    一天，青年们刚从田里收工回来，一位领导同志赶忙把大家召集到一起，急促地讲道：“姑娘们！我们村附近，正在进行一场军事演习，帝修反妄想欺侮我们，可是我们勇敢的山鹰是任何敌人也征服不了的！我们有信心，用我们的枪和镐打垮一切敢于来犯的敌人！现在，战士们正在抢修工事，几个小伙子提出建议，要去帮助我们的子弟兵尽快把工事修完，你们看怎么样？同意这个建议吗？”姑娘们异口同声地响亮回答：“为了党和人民，我们随时都准备贡献出一切！”就这样，组织起来的女青年，拿起镐和锹，雄赳赳气昂昂地来到了战士们的工地，一场修筑工事的紧张劳动热火朝天地开始了。
    “我们一定要完成任务！”姑娘们互相鼓励着说，“我们不但要象战士一样挥镐使锹，还要练习打枪”。莱妮被选为队长，她以自身的模范行动和火热般的语言，把全队的同志组织到各个重要的岗位上。每天晚上评奖时，她所率领的小队总是受到表扬。有一天工作进展得很不理想，莱妮的心里很难过。在评奖会议结束以后，传来了休息的号声，青年小伙子和姑娘们有说有笑地散开了。莱妮一个人向工地走去了。锹、镐和推土车堆在一旁。她抡起镐和锹就铲起土来。莱妮就是这样一个不知疲劳、冷静沉着的姑娘。当人们夸她如何能干的时候，她总是说：“还差得远呢！我们年轻人是国家的栋梁，应该发奋图强啊！”
    沉重的铁镐在她的手中闪烁出一道道银光，推土车在她的脚前不时地飞转。“等同志们来时，我一定干完它！”她对自己说。就这样，一车车的泥土沙石被她迅速地运到老远的地方去了。地面眼见就要填平，可是她还是不太满意自己，总想设法干得再多，再好些，以便使同志们增强必胜的信心。“时间还有，我还要推几车！”她小声地对自己说道。她把车靠近崖下，拚命地挥镐铲土。就在她放下镐，刚刚拿起锹准备装土时，突然间，“轰隆”一声巨响，一大堆泥土、石头从崖顶上轱辘辘地滚下来。她正想躲开，但是来不及了。莱妮，这位浑身是胆的姑娘，手里紧握着锹和镐，胸膛里满怀着对党和祖国的无限热爱，英勇地牺牲在战斗岗位上了。
    莱妮牺牲后的一个星期，在她生前修筑工事的连队里，发生了这样一件更为激动人心的事情：一天，突然有人轻轻地敲政委办公室的门。政委放下文件，抬头一看，只见一个朝气蓬勃的姑娘站在他的面前。姑娘灼灼的目光，洋溢着青春的活力，这使政委立刻想起了几天前牺牲的莱妮同志。
    她向前迈了几步，仔细地打量着周围的一切。她不知从何处说起，只是讲：“我是……莱妮！”
    政委十分惊奇，目瞪口呆：“怎么，你是……莱妮？哪一个莱妮？”
    “莱妮·素黛里迈雅！”
    政委向前逼近了几步，发现这位年青姑娘就象刚牺牲不久的莱妮一样，飒爽英姿，精神焕发。
    这个姑娘接着说：“莱妮为了执行战斗任务，英勇地牺牲了，可是，正象您和其他同志所说的，她将永远活在我们的心里！我是她的妹妹，名叫莱秋，我是为了替换她的战斗岗位，接她的班到这里来的！”
    于是，第二天就在莱妮战斗过的地方，又出现了一个新的莱妮。这新的莱妮同人民军战士一起英勇地战斗在高高的山巅。
    莱妮·素黛里迈雅，象十五岁的女共产党员什库塔·瓦塔一样，生命虽然很短促，但是她将千秋万代地活在山鹰之国的儿女们的心中；莱妮·素黛里迈雅，这朵农业社鲜艳的红花，将永世地开放在山村的田野上。英雄的事迹显示了阿尔巴尼亚人民光荣的革命斗争传统，伟大的共产主义风格和崇高的革命英雄主义精神！
    啊！伟大的欧洲的社会主义明灯，山鹰之国无比坚强的人民啊！汹涌的德林河水流不尽，革命自有后来人！红色的接力棒一代一代传下去，雄伟的山河万年春！
                红山鹰
