We warmly hail the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The important editorials published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* convey our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell just a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." By seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reviewing Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, we have further heightened our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and have become more resolute in our determination to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a lifetime.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the broad masses of laboring people, is the lifeline of revolutionary soldiers, is the only correct line of our Party, and is the fundamental guarantee of our victories. During the democratic revolution, the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, overthrew the three big mountains and won the victory of the people's revolution; today, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we continue the revolution to consolidate the regime, relying on the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by Liu Shaoqi, smashed the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the Party, and foiled Liu Shaoqi's plot to restore capitalism, greatly consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Over the more than forty years of struggle of our Party, it has been proven that adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line means victory for the revolution, and everything for the laboring people; deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line means defeat for the revolution, the restoration of capitalism, and the loss of everything for the laboring people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has been developed through struggles against various incorrect lines. Since the day our Party was founded, there have been struggles between the two lines within the Party. The loyal running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, and the agent of the bourgeoisie, Liu Shaoqi, has always opposed Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Together with the representatives of "Left" and Right opportunism within the Party, Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, and Wang Ming, he has persistently pushed the reactionary bourgeois line, attempting to lead the Chinese revolution into the abyss of darkness, ensuring that the laboring people would never be liberated. Reviewing the decades of struggle, especially since the founding of the nation, between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, we have come to a deeper understanding that the greatest politics is the struggle between the lines; the greatest loyalty is unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Over the nineteen years since liberation, I have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must always maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and hard work, and must always maintain the style of hard struggle." I have continued to maintain the spirit of a revolutionary soldier and the vigor of a Communist Party member. Especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, and participated in the "three supports, two militaries" work. The reason I was able to achieve some results in supporting the left is that I relied on Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," relied on the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and relied on Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions—in a word, I relied on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Today, combining the practice of struggle with the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reviewing Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, I have come to a deeper understanding that a revolutionary soldier, to follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime, must seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines, and in the struggle, continuously heighten the awareness of the struggle between the lines and continuously enhance the consciousness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a lifetime—this is my aspiration.

### 一辈子紧跟伟大领袖毛主席  一辈子捍卫毛主席革命路线

    一辈子紧跟伟大领袖毛主席  一辈子捍卫毛主席革命路线
    全国一级战斗英雄、解放军某部副参谋长　周文江
    我们热烈欢呼毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的重新发表。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》为此发表的重要社论中，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”认真地学习毛主席的最新指示，重温毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，使我们进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，更加坚定了我们一辈子捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强决心。
    毛主席的革命路线，代表了广大劳动人民群众的根本利益，是我们革命战士的命根子，是我们党的唯一正确的路线，是我们取得胜利的根本保证。民主革命时期，中国人民在毛主席革命路线的指引下，推翻了三座大山，取得了人民革命的胜利；今天，在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命，巩固政权，同样靠毛主席革命路线的指引。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派，摧毁了隐藏在党内的资产阶级黑司令部，粉碎了刘少奇复辟资本主义的阴谋，极大地巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。我们党四十多年的斗争实践雄辩地证明：坚持毛主席的革命路线，革命就胜利，劳动人民就有了一切；离开了毛主席的革命路线，革命就会失败，资本主义就会复辟，劳动人民就会丧失一切。毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”毛主席的革命路线，是在同各种错误路线的斗争中发展起来的。在我们党内，从党诞生的那一天起，就存在着两条路线的斗争。帝修反的忠实走狗、资产阶级的代理人刘少奇，一贯反对毛主席，反对毛主席的革命路线，他和党内“左”、右倾机会主义的代表人物陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明一样，竭力推行反动的资产阶级路线，妄图把中国革命引向黑暗的深渊，使劳动人民永远不得翻身。回顾几十年来，特别是建国以来毛主席的革命路线同刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线进行的惊心动魄的斗争，使我们更加深刻地体会到，最大的政治，就是路线斗争；最大的忠，就是无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    解放十九年来，我牢记毛主席的教导：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”继续保持了革命战士的本色和共产党员的朝气。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，我积极地响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号召，参加了“三支”“两军”工作。我所以能够在支左工作中做出一点成绩，靠的是毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，靠的是毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，靠的是毛主席的一系列最新指示，一句话，靠的是毛主席的革命路线。今天结合斗争实践，学习毛主席最新指示，重温毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告的时候，更加深刻地体会到，一个革命战士，要一辈子紧跟毛主席，就必须认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，在斗争中不断提高路线斗争觉悟，不断增强捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。一辈子紧跟毛主席，一辈子捍卫毛主席的革命路线，这就是我的志愿。
