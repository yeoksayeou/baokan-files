The broad masses of agricultural workers in Albania are celebrating their great national holiday—the 56th anniversary of Albania's independence and the 24th anniversary of its liberation—with glorious achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the vast rural areas of Albania are filled with a vigorous revolutionary atmosphere.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out at the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party in November 1966: "The only path for socialist construction in the countryside is the collectivization of agriculture. Apart from collectivization, any other path can only lead to the development or restoration of capitalism in the countryside." Inspired by this teaching, some mountainous areas that had not yet organized cooperatives achieved collectivization within three months after the closure of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party. Now, 98% of households and 98.8% of arable land in Albania have been collectivized. Thus, the socialist economic system has not only taken a firm foothold in the plains but also in the remote mountainous regions.

Under the Party's leadership, the broad masses of cooperative members have launched a fierce offensive against the old ideas of the exploiting classes in the revolutionary movement, combating bureaucracy, breaking religious superstitions and backward customs, and fighting for the complete liberation of women, encouraging them to participate more actively in revolutionary and productive activities. The broad masses of members have also proposed and implemented many revolutionary initiatives that reflect a high level of socialist consciousness: advocating the spirit of putting collective interests above personal interests, reducing private plots, reducing self-raised livestock, and strengthening the collective economy; cadres actively participating in collective production labor, closely linking with the masses; cooperatives in the southern plains proactively sending cadres to newly established brother cooperatives in the northern mountains to vigorously support agricultural and pastoral production there, and so on.

The vigorous development of the revolutionary movement has promoted the further revolutionary transformation of the thoughts of the broad masses of agricultural workers, powerfully arousing their revolutionary enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside, and driving the rapid development of agricultural production. This year, the national agricultural output value is expected to increase by 28.1% compared to the last year of the previous five-year plan—1965.

Following Comrade Hoxha's teachings of "increasing grain production is the fundamental task of agriculture and the entire national economy" and "fighting for self-sufficiency in grain is and has always been a struggle for socialism," the Albanian agricultural workers have launched a high tide of agricultural production centered on increasing grain production and achieved remarkable results. After last year's bumper harvest of grain and the highest historical record of wheat yield per unit area, they have again achieved a good harvest of grain crops this year. Despite the poor climatic conditions this year, due to the measures taken by the agricultural workers and their day-and-night struggle, good news of production has been frequently reported. The agricultural workers in the central mountainous region of Mat District have seriously implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee, increased the yield per unit area in one-third of the wheat sowing area, with an average yield of 31.5 hundredweight per hectare; the Kruja District has an average yield of 31.4 hundredweight per hectare in one-third of the wheat sowing area. In the Durres District, the average yield per hectare of the entire wheat sowing area is 19.6 hundredweight, reaching the planned level for 1970. The rapidly developing rice in recent years has also achieved a good harvest. In the 679 hectares of paddy fields in the Durres District, the average yield per hectare is 54 hundredweight; the Kavaia Agricultural Cooperative in this district has achieved 80 hundredweight per hectare in 60 hectares of paddy fields.

At the same time, livestock and fruit planting, which are of great significance in Albania's national economy, have also achieved remarkable development. In the past seven years alone, livestock production has increased by 23%, and fruit production has increased by 80%.

To strive for the vigorous development of production, agricultural workers, with unprecedented labor enthusiasm, have fought against nature on a large scale, carrying out large-scale land reclamation and water conservancy projects. In the first three years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), a total of 67,000 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed in mountainous and hilly areas, thus increasing the current arable land area to nearly double that of 1938 before liberation. Due to the efforts of the members in opening canals, diverting water, and building reservoirs, the current irrigated area in the country has reached 227,000 hectares, nearly seven times that of 1938, making 47% of the arable land in the country irrigated land.

To promote the rapid development of agricultural production, the broad masses of agricultural workers have also extensively carried out mass scientific experiments. This year, the nation's broad masses of agricultural and pastoral workers and scientific workers have conducted a total of 4,000 scientific experiments, an increase of 65% compared to last year, solving many production problems. As a result of the extensive development of scientific experiments, the area of high-yield fields in the country has reached 17% of the total sowing area.

The broad masses of agricultural cooperative members in Albania have actively responded to the battle call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party to increase grain production, giving full play to the human factor, fighting against nature, and achieving a good harvest this year.

    广大农业劳动者以辉煌成就欢庆祖国的伟大节日
    阿尔巴尼亚农村呈现朝气蓬勃的革命景象
    思想革命化运动推动农业生产迅速发展，今年全国农业总产值预计比上一个五年计划最后一年——一九六五年增长百分之二十八点一
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者，以在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就欢庆自己的伟大节日——阿尔巴尼亚独立五十六周年和解放二十四周年。
    在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，阿尔巴尼亚的广大农村充满着朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    霍查同志在一九六六年十一月召开的劳动党第五次代表大会上指出：“农村社会主义建设的唯一道路是农业的集体化。除了集体化，任何别的道路只能导致在农村中发展或恢复资本主义。”在这一教导的鼓舞下，一些没有组织起合作社的山区农村，在劳动党第五次代表大会闭幕后不到三个月的时间内就实现了合作化。现在，阿尔巴尼亚全国百分之九十八的农户和百分之九十八点八的耕地都实现了合作化。这样，社会主义的经济制度不仅在平原地区，而且在偏僻的山区也占据了巩固的阵地。
    广大农业合作社社员在党的领导下，在革命化运动中向剥削阶级的旧思想发动了猛烈的攻势，冲击官僚主义，大破宗教迷信和落后的习俗，开展彻底解放妇女的斗争，使她们更积极地投身到革命和生产活动中去。广大社员还提出和实行了许多体现着高度的社会主义觉悟的革命倡议：提倡把集体利益置于个人利益之上的精神，缩小自留地，减少自养牲畜，加强集体经济；干部积极参加集体生产劳动，密切同群众的联系；南方平原地区的合作社主动向北方山区新成立的兄弟社派遣干部，大力支援那里的农牧业生产，等等。
    革命化运动的蓬勃开展，促进了广大农业劳动者思想的进一步革命化，有力地激发了他们建设社会主义新农村的革命干劲和劳动热情，推动了农业生产的迅速发展。今年全国的农业总产值预计将比上一个五年计划最后一年——一九六五年增长百分之二十八点一。
    阿尔巴尼亚农业劳动者遵循霍查同志“增加粮食生产是农业和整个国民经济的基本任务”、“为粮食自给而斗争，过去和现在都始终是为社会主义而斗争”的教导，掀起了以增加粮食生产为中心的农业生产高潮，并取得了显著的成果。他们继去年获得了粮食丰收和小麦单位面积产量达到历史上的最高纪录之后，今年又夺得了粮食作物的好收成。尽管今年的气候条件不好，但由于农业劳动者采取了相应的措施，日夜奋战，仍然频频传出了生产捷报。位于中部山区的马蒂区的农业劳动者认真执行劳动党中央的指示，在三分之一的小麦播种面积上提高了单位面积产量，平均每公顷收获三十一点五公担；克鲁亚区在三分之一的小麦播种面积上平均每公顷产量为三十一点四公担。在都拉斯区，全部小麦播种面积的平均每公顷产量为十九点六公担，达到了一九七○年的计划水平。近年来迅速发展起来的水稻今年也取得了良好的收成。在都拉斯区的六百七十九公顷的稻田上，每公顷平均收获了五十四公担；这个区的卡瓦拉农业合作社在六十公顷稻田上，每公顷达到了八十公担。
    与此同时，在阿尔巴尼亚的国民经济中有着重要意义的畜牧业和水果种植业也得到了显著的发展。仅在过去的七年中，畜牧业生产就增长了百分之二十三，水果生产增长了百分之八十。
    为了争取生产的蓬勃发展，农业劳动者以空前的劳动热情同大自然展开了搏斗，进行了大规模的垦荒和兴修水利的工作。在第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）的头三年中，在山区和丘陵地带总共开出了六万七千公顷的荒地，从而使目前全国的耕地面积比解放前的一九三八年扩大了近一倍。由于社员们大力开渠引水，修建水库，现在全国的灌溉面积已达到二十二万七千公顷，比一九三八年扩大了近七倍，使全国耕地面积的百分之四十七都变成了水浇地。
    为了促使农业生产的迅速发展，广大农业劳动者还广泛地开展了群众性的科学实验。今年全国广大农牧业劳动者和科学工作者进行的科学实验共达四千项，比去年增加了百分之六十五，解决了许多生产中的问题。由于科学实验广泛开展的结果，使全国高产田的面积达到全部播种面积的百分之十七。
