The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to deceive the peoples of Eastern Europe and the revolutionary peoples of the world, uses the pretext of "defending the interests of the socialist family" to engage in nefarious neo-colonialist activities. The Soviet revisionist clique has long since degenerated into social imperialism. It treats Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence, using excuses such as "international socialist division of labor," "production specialization," "production cooperation," and "economic integration," to turn some Eastern European countries into its sources of raw materials, investment sites, and markets for its goods. The "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" (CMEA) is a tool used by Soviet social imperialism to control the financial and economic lifelines of some Eastern European countries, plundering and exploiting the peoples of Eastern Europe.

	So-called "production specialization" is colonialization

	The Soviet revisionist clique, within the CMEA, heavily promotes "production specialization," establishing a colonial and semi-colonial economic foundation in some Eastern European countries. This so-called "production specialization" means that one or several member countries concentrate on producing a single product to meet the needs of other member countries. Here, there is a "division of labor": the Soviet clique concentrates on producing machinery and equipment and other industrial products, while other member countries concentrate on producing food and other agricultural and mineral raw materials. For example, Hungary supplies 32.3% of the wool, 57.7% of the canned vegetables, and 46% of the medicinal materials imported by the Soviet Union. Bulgaria supplies the Soviet Union with large quantities of tobacco, fruits, vegetables, and other foodstuffs. In the long-term trade agreements between the Soviet Union and Hungary and Bulgaria from 1966 to 1970, it was clearly stipulated that Hungary would supply the Soviet Union with agricultural products and other consumer goods worth 670 million rubles. Bulgaria would supply the Soviet Union with similar agricultural products worth 325 million rubles. Even industrially developed Czechoslovakia is a major supplier of asphalt, uranium ore, pipes, and many tire raw materials to the Soviet Union. In 1965, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique supplied the Soviet Union with raw materials worth 38% of its total exports to the Soviet Union, amounting to 349 million rubles. Meanwhile, the Soviet leadership exports large quantities of industrial products to these countries, obstructing the development of their own industries. Not only are the industrially underdeveloped Eastern European countries turned into markets for Soviet industrial products, but even the relatively industrially developed Czechoslovakia is no exception. Czechoslovakia has to purchase large quantities of various types of machinery, transportation equipment, and complete sets of industrial equipment from the Soviet Union every year. In reality, these countries have become raw material suppliers and markets for Soviet goods.

	Under the banner of "production specialization," the Soviet Union has caused these countries' economies to develop abnormally. In this regard, Czechoslovakia is a typical example. The Soviet Union controls 67% of Czechoslovakia's national economy. The Czechoslovak revisionist clique, subservient to the Soviet Union's directives, has developed industry one-sidedly, leading to a significant decline in agricultural production. Agricultural output remains below pre-war levels, and in 1964, grain production was 40% lower than the highest pre-war level. In the mining sector, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique has not fully utilized domestic resources, always relying on imports from the Soviet Union. Under the destruction of "production specialization," industrial output once declined, technology was backward, and machinery and equipment imported from the Soviet Union played an increasingly dominant role in Czechoslovakia's national economy.

	Due to the implementation of "production specialization," the Soviet Union has controlled the foreign trade of other CMEA member countries, causing these countries to become severely dependent on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union controls more than 35% of Czechoslovakia's heavy industrial product exports; 95% of oil imports, 65% of iron sand, 50% of copper, and 99% of wheat. The Soviet Union controls 79% of Hungary's exports of lifting and transportation equipment, 82% of food industry equipment, 68% of telecommunications equipment, 79% of ships and mobile equipment, 60% of medicines, 85% of crude oil imports, 92% of petroleum products, 95% of iron sand, 97% of pig iron, 91% of sulfate fertilizers, 77% of electricity, and 73% of various types of timber. In this way, the Soviet Union has the foreign trade of these countries in its grasp, manipulating and controlling these countries' foreign trade policies at will.

	Using "production cooperation" as a pretext, turning some Eastern European countries into raw material processing plants

	Soviet social imperialism also uses "production cooperation" as a pretext to export raw materials and control the steel, shipbuilding, chemical, petroleum, and textile industries of CMEA member countries in the production sector, turning these countries into its raw material processing plants. In the CMEA member countries, some industrial sectors are largely controlled by the Soviet Union. For example, the petroleum and chemical industries of Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland are like this.

	The Soviet Union supplies most of the industrial raw materials to Eastern European countries, processes them into finished products locally, and then takes them back, and then exports them back to Eastern European countries at high prices, carrying out ruthless exploitation. For example, in 1964, more than 56% of Czechoslovakia's raw material imports came from the Soviet Union, while 50% of its domestically produced machinery, 80% of its rolling mill equipment, more than 50% of its light industrial equipment, and 100% of its ships and ship equipment were sent to the Soviet Union. In addition, Czechoslovakia also produces various industrial parts for the Soviet Union, such as car parts like carburetors, while importing finished cars and other industrial equipment from the Soviet Union. Hungary sends its domestic iron ore to Soviet factories and then imports finished aluminum from the Soviet Union at high prices. These facts strongly expose the plundering nature of this so-called "production cooperation."

	Using "aid," "loans," and "technical cooperation" as pretexts, exporting large quantities of unsalable products at high prices

	Soviet social imperialism also uses "aid," "loans," and "economic and technical cooperation" to export large amounts of funds to CMEA member countries. The "loans" that the Soviet Union provides to member countries such as Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland total tens of billions of rubles. It must be pointed out that the so-called "aid" and "loans" that the Soviet Union provides to CMEA member countries are not in cash, but under the pretext of "aid" and "loans," it exports large quantities of unsalable products and equipment to these countries at high prices. For example, in the five-year plan from 1966 to 1970, the Soviet Union will export a large number of complete sets of factory equipment to Eastern European countries under the pretext of "aid." During this period, the Soviet Union will export complete sets of equipment for 30 factories to Hungary.

	Through unequal exchange, ruthlessly exploiting and plundering the peoples of Eastern Europe

	The trade between the Soviet revisionist clique and other CMEA member countries has always been unequal. They not only force these countries to purchase their unsalable goods but also, through unequal exchange, ruthlessly exploit the peoples of Eastern Europe. They use the method of revaluing the ruble to raise the export prices to CMEA countries and lower the import prices from these countries. They take advantage of the lack of raw materials in CMEA countries, exchanging a small amount of raw materials for a large amount of industrial products, blatantly plundering the cheap labor of these countries' peoples. For example, a machine sold to the Soviet Union by Czechoslovakia can only exchange 140 tons of iron sand, while selling to other countries can exchange 520 tons of iron sand; a railway vehicle sold to the Soviet Union can only exchange 1,300 tons of oil, while selling to other countries can exchange 3,400 tons of oil. The Soviet Union controls the industry of CMEA member countries and carries out astonishing price reductions on the industrial products exported to the Soviet Union by these countries. For example, a DP1600 type lathe sold to the Soviet Union by the German Democratic Republic is only 15,000 rubles, while selling to other countries can be sold for 20,000 rubles; a GFL400×300 milling machine sold to the Soviet Union is 6,000 rubles, while selling to other countries can be sold for 9,000 rubles. The Soviet Union sells oil to Italy at $1.31 per barrel, to Japan at $1.26, to West Germany at $1.27, while selling to Eastern European countries at $2.61, and the price sold to Hungary is as high as $3.04. The price of nuclear reactors sold to some Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union is four times higher than the international market price.

	Using "economic integration" as a pretext, trampling on the sovereignty of other countries

	The Soviet Union, under the pretext of "coordinating" the national economic plans of Eastern European countries, heavily promotes "economic integration" and "supranational" "departmental organizations," placing itself above the CMEA member countries, rudely interfering in the internal affairs of member countries, and trampling on their sovereignty. After the fallacy of the "inter-state economic comprehensive body" in 1964, the Soviet revisionist clique, at the end of 1966, manipulated the CMEA to pass a so-called "departmental organization agreement" as a means of controlling member countries. According to this agreement, a series of "supranational" departmental organizations will be established to regulate production, sales, distribution, and raw material supply in the CMEA countries. In this way, these countries have actually become appendages of the Soviet Union. While the revisionist ruling cliques in Eastern Europe sell out the interests of their own people, they kowtow to the Soviet Union, allowing it to control their economic lifelines.

	In summary, under the neo-colonialism practiced by the Soviet revisionist clique, many countries in Eastern Europe have become colonies and protectorates of the Soviet Union, suffering its plundering and bullying. However, such days will not last long. The Soviet Union's aggressive actions are increasingly awakening the oppressed masses of Eastern Europe, inspiring them to rise up and wage a revolutionary struggle against Soviet social imperialism and its agents.

专栏：苏修社会帝国主义的狰狞面目

    看苏修怎样通过“经互会”对东欧人民进行掠夺和剥削！
    苏修叛徒集团为了欺骗东欧人民和世界革命人民，打着“保卫社会主义大家庭的利益”的幌子，干着新殖民主义的罪恶勾当。苏修叛徒集团早已堕落成为社会帝国主义。它把东欧当作自己的势力范围，借口什么“国际社会主义分工”、“生产专业化”、“生产合作化”、“经济一体化”等等，把东欧一些国家变为自己的原料供应地、投资场所和商品销售市场。“经济互助委员会”就是苏修社会帝国主义用来控制东欧一些国家财政、经济命脉，掠夺和剥削东欧人民的一个工具。
    所谓“生产专业化”就是殖民地化
    苏修叛徒集团在“经互会”中大搞“生产专业化”，在东欧一些国家建立殖民地、半殖民地的经济基础。所谓“生产专业化”，就是一个或几个成员国，集中生产一种产品，来满足其他成员国的需要。在这里有一个“分工”，这就是苏修集中生产机器设备等工业品，其他成员国则集中生产食品和其他农矿原料。例如，匈牙利供应了苏修进口的羊毛的百分之三十二点三，罐头蔬菜的百分之五十七点七，药材的百分之四十六。保加利亚供应苏修大量的烟草、水果、蔬菜及其他食品。在一九六六年到一九七○年苏修同匈、保的长期贸易协定中，就有明文规定：匈牙利供应苏修价值达六亿七千万卢布的农产品及其他消费品。保加利亚供应苏修这类农产品价值也达三亿两千五百万卢布。甚至工业比较发达的捷克斯洛伐克，也是苏修沥青、铀矿、管子和许多轮胎原料的主要供应者。一九六五年捷修集团供应苏修的原料就占向苏修出口总值的百分之三十八，达三亿四千九百万卢布。与此同时，苏修领导集团向这些国家输出大量的工业品，阻挠这些国家发展自己的工业。不仅工业不发达的东欧国家变成了苏修工业品的市场，就是工业比较发达的捷克斯洛伐克也不例外。捷克斯洛伐克每年都要从苏修购买大量的各种类型的机器、运输工具和成套工业设备。实际上，这些国家已经成为苏修的原料供应地和商品的销售市场。
    苏修打着“生产专业化”的招牌，使这些国家的经济畸形发展。在这方面，捷克斯洛伐克是一个典型例子。苏修控制了捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的百分之六十七。捷修叛徒集团屈从于苏修的指挥棒，片面地发展工业，造成农业生产大幅度下降，农业产量仍然低于战前水平，一九六四年粮食产量比战前最高水平下降了百分之四十。在矿产方面，捷修集团也没有充分利用国内资源，总是依靠从苏修进口。在“生产专业化”的破坏下，工业产量也曾一度下降，技术低下，从苏修进口机械和设备在捷克斯洛伐克国民经济中越来越占主要地位。
    由于推行“生产专业化”，苏修控制了“经互会”其他成员国的对外贸易，造成这些国家对苏修的严重依赖。苏修控制了捷克斯洛伐克重工业品出口的百分之三十五以上；石油进口的百分之九十五，铁砂的百分之六十五，铜的百分之五十，小麦的百分之九十九。苏修控制了匈牙利起重及运输设备出口的百分之七十九，食品工业设备的百分之八十二，电讯器具的百分之六十八，船只、流动设备的百分之七十九，药品的百分之六十，原油进口的百分之八十五，石油产品的百分之九十二，铁砂的百分之九十五，生铁的百分之九十七，硫酸盐化肥的百分之九十一，电力的百分之七十七，各种木材的百分之七十三。这样，苏修就把这些国家的对外贸易掌握在它的魔爪之中，任意摆布和左右这些国家的对外贸易政策。
    以“生产合作”为名把东欧一些国家变为原料加工厂
    苏修社会帝国主义还以“生产合作”为名输出原料，从生产领域控制“经互会”成员国的钢铁、造船、化学、石油、纺织等工业部门，使这些国家变为自己的原料加工厂。“经互会”成员国中，有的工业部门大部分为苏修所控制。例如，捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰等国家的石油工业和化学工业就是如此。
    苏修供应东欧国家大部分工业原料，在当地加工成为成品后拿回去，然后又以高价向东欧国家输出，进行残酷的剥削。例如，捷克斯洛伐克在一九六四年原料进口的百分之五十六以上靠苏修，而本国生产的百分之五十的机械产品，百分之八十的轧钢设备，百分之五十以上的轻工业设备，百分之百的船舶和船舶设备都运往苏联。此外，捷克斯洛伐克还为苏修生产各种工业零件，例如，汽化器等汽车零件，而从苏修进口成品汽车和其他工业设备。匈牙利将本国的铁矾土运进苏修的工厂，然后从苏修用高价进口成品铝。这些事实，有力地揭露了这种“生产合作”的掠夺本质。
    打着“援助”、“贷款”、“技术合作”的幌子高价输出大量滞销产品
    苏修社会帝国主义还利用“援助”、“贷款”和“经济和技术合作”的方式，向“经互会”成员国输出了大量的资金。苏修给捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、波兰等成员国的“贷款”，总额竟达数十亿卢布之巨。这里必须指出的是，苏修对“经互会”成员国的所谓“援助”、“贷款”，并不是拿现金，而是假借“援助”、“贷款”之名，向这些国家用高价输出大量的滞销产品和设备。例如，在一九六六年到一九七○年的五年计划中，苏修将以“援助”为名向东欧各国输出大量的工厂成套设备。在这一期间，苏修将向匈牙利输出三十个工厂的成套设备。
    通过不等价交换残酷剥削和掠夺东欧人民
    苏修叛徒集团同“经互会”其他成员国之间的贸易，历来就是不平等的。他们不仅强迫这些国家购买他们的滞销商品，而且通过不等价交换，对东欧人民进行残酷的剥削。他们用卢布升值的方法，提高对“经互会”国家的出口价格，减低从这些国家的进口价格。他们利用“经互会”国家缺乏原料，以少量的原料换回大量的工业品，明目张胆地掠夺这些国家人民的廉价劳动力。例如，捷克斯洛伐克的一台机器售给苏修，只能换回一百四十吨铁砂，而售给其他国家则能换回五百二十吨铁砂；一辆铁道车辆卖给苏修，只能换一千三百吨石油，而卖给其他国家则能换回三千四百吨石油。苏修控制了“经互会”成员国的工业，对这些国家向苏修出口的工业产品，进行惊人的压价。例如，德意志民主共和国的DP1600型车床卖给苏修只有一万五千卢布，而卖给其他国家则可卖二万卢布；GFL400×300铣床卖给苏修是六千卢布，而卖给其他国家可卖九千卢布。苏修卖给意大利的石油每桶价格一点三一美元，卖给日本是一点二六美元，卖给西德是一点二七美元，而卖给东欧国家则为二点六一美元，卖给匈牙利的价格竟高达三点零四美元。苏修卖给东欧一些国家的原子反应堆价格比国际市场高四倍。
    借口“经济一体化”蹂躏其他国家的主权
    苏修以“协调”东欧各国的国民经济计划为名，大搞“经济一体化”、搞“超国家”的“分部门机构”，凌驾于“经互会”各成员国之上，粗暴地干涉各成员国的内政，蹂躏它们的主权。在一九六四年抛出的“国家间经济综合体”的谬论破产后，苏修叛徒集团于一九六六年底又操纵“经互会”通过了一个所谓“分部门组织协定”，作为控制各成员国的手段。根据这项协定，要成立一系列的“超国家”的分部门组织机构，在“经互会”各国的生产、销售、分配、原料供应等方面进行调节。这样一来，这些国家实际上已经变成苏修的附属国。而东欧那些修正主义统治集团则出卖本国人民的利益，对苏修屈膝投降，让其掌握经济命脉。
    总之，在苏修叛徒集团推行的新殖民主义之下，东欧许多国家都沦为苏修的殖民地和保护国，受尽它的掠夺和欺凌。但是，这样的日子是不会长久的。苏修的侵略行径正在日益促进东欧被压迫人民群众的觉悟，激发他们起来进行反对苏修社会帝国主义及其代理人的革命斗争。
