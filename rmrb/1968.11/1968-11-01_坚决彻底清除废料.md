Resolutely and Thoroughly Eliminate the Dregs

		The Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to adapt to his anti-Party and usurping-the-Party needs, vigorously advocates the "theory of intra-Party peace," maliciously slandering intra-Party struggle as "deliberately seeking 'objects of struggle' (Party comrades) as 'representatives of opportunism' to carry out struggles, sacrificing and attacking one or a few comrades, 'killing the chicken to scare the monkey.' This is a poisonous shell that the Chinese Khrushchev is firing at the Party.

		In March of this year, while our company was carrying out the "support agriculture" task in Xin Village, Xitao Commune, Lingshou County, Hebei, we encountered such an incident: After the latest directive of Chairman Mao that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and is a great revolution that is being carried out by the masses of the people under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao against those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road in the Party and against the bourgeois and all other exploiting classes" was issued, a traitor who had infiltrated the Party and usurped the positions of Party branch committee member and production team leader in the village saw that the situation was not good, and began to spread the word, saying, "The Party members in our village were all beggars and refugees in the past, and they are all old Party members who joined the Party before liberation. They have been revolutionaries for decades and have no problems." In response to this situation, we soldiers, together with the revolutionary committee, organized Party members and the masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directive, recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of intra-Party peace." Everyone used Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle to investigate the activities of class enemies during the Cultural Revolution. Soon, this traitor, along with a deserter and an escaped criminal, were exposed, the Party organization was purified, and the fundamental reason for Xin Village's long-term backwardness was found. Revolutionary production quickly caught up. Xin Village has now become an advanced unit for the whole county to learn from. According to the logic of the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of intra-Party peace," what we did was to deliberately seek "objects of struggle" and disrupt "intra-Party peace," right? Pfft! Put away your counter-revolutionary revisionist trash!

		Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party also often has enemies and enemy thoughts infiltrating it, ... for such people, it is undoubtedly necessary to adopt the means of ruthless struggle or merciless blows, because those bad people are using these means against the Party, and if we still tolerate them, we will fall right into the bad people's trap." Chairman Mao's teaching profoundly reveals the objective law of intra-Party class struggle and is the sharpest ideological weapon for us to struggle against class enemies who have infiltrated the Party. For those traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and class enemies who have infiltrated the Party with irrefutable evidence, we must "fight ruthlessly and strike mercilessly," until we fight them down and expose them, clean them out of the Party, and not show any mercy. Otherwise, the Party will be usurped by these agents of the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the socialist mountains and rivers will change color!

		"A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. If it does not expel the dregs and absorb new blood, the Party will have no vigor." Chairman Mao's battle cry sounds the death knell for the complete failure of the revisionist line of building the Party, and let the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of intra-Party peace" go to hell!

    坚决彻底清除废料
    装甲兵某部二连指导员　王瑞和
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，为了适应他反党篡党的需要，大肆鼓吹“党内和平论”，恶毒诬蔑党内斗争是“故意去寻找‘斗争对象’（党内的同志）作为‘机会主义的代表者’来开展斗争，牺牲与打击这一个或这几个同志，‘杀鸡给猴看’”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫向党进攻的一颗毒弹。
    今年三月份，我们连在河北灵寿县西桃公社新村执行“支农”任务中，遇到过这样一件事：当毛主席的“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”最新指示发表后，村里一个混进党内并窃踞了党支部委员、生产队长要职的汉奸分子见势不妙，便四下散布说：“咱们村的党员过去都是逃荒要饭的穷哥们，又都是解放前入党的老党员，革命干了几十年了，没啥清头儿。”针对这种情况，我们解放军就同革命委员会一起，组织党员和广大群众反复学习毛主席最新指示，进行忆苦思甜，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“党内和平论”。大家用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大查阶级敌人在文化大革命中的活动情况。不久就把这个汉奸分子及一个叛徒、一个潜逃犯挖了出来，纯洁了党的组织，找到了新村长期落后翻不了身的根本原因，革命生产很快就赶了上去。新村现在已经成为全县学习的先进单位。按照中国赫鲁晓夫“党内和平论”的逻辑，我们这样做是故意寻找“斗争对象”，破坏了“党内和平”吧！呸！收起你的那套反革命修正主义破烂货吧！
    毛主席教导我们：“党内也常常有敌人和敌对思想混进来，……对于这种人，毫无疑义地是应该采用残酷斗争或无情打击的手段的，因为那些坏人正在利用这种手段对付党，我们如果还对他们宽容，那就会正中坏人的奸计。”毛主席这一教导深刻揭示了党内阶级斗争的客观规律，是我们同混进党内的阶级敌人进行斗争的最锐利的思想武器。对于那些证据确凿的混入党内的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子，就是要“残酷斗争、无情打击”，直到把他们斗倒、斗臭，清除出党，决不手软。不然党就会被这些资产阶级、国民党反动派的代理人所篡夺，社会主义江山就要变色！
    “一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的战斗号令，敲响了修正主义建党路线彻底完蛋的丧钟，让中国赫鲁晓夫的“党内和平论”见鬼去吧！
