On the occasion of the enthusiastic celebration of the 24th anniversary of the liberation of heroic Albania, we watched the Albanian film "Vast Horizons" with great excitement. This film reflects the fiery struggles of Albanian port workers in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and portrays the heroic image of an outstanding member of the Albanian Labor Party, the crane operator Ulan.

As we watched the image of Ulan on the screen, we naturally thought of the outstanding member of the Albanian Labor Party, the floating crane operator of the Durres Port, and the great communist warrior – Adam Reka. Two years ago, this great communist warrior sacrificed his life to protect the state's property during an unprecedented storm that hit the Durres Port in Albanian history. Isn't the protagonist Ulan in the film "Vast Horizons" a portrayal of Adam Reka's heroic image?

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, once wrote in the guestbook during his visit to the floating crane ship named after Reka: "Reka is a true brave communist. For Reka, the party, the people, and himself are one." The Ulan in "Vast Horizons" is indeed the image of such a true brave communist. Ulan is infinitely loyal to the party and the people; he dedicates everything to the party and the people.

Ulan is dedicated to the revolution. Whatever the party asks him to do, he does it; wherever the party needs him to go, he goes. Under the white terror of fascism, the young Ulan bravely joined the guerrilla forces and fought heroically for the liberation of his country. After the liberation of the country, he actively responded to the party's call to participate in the socialist construction of his country and worked as a crane operator at a port. He is extremely responsible for his work and has a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause. One early morning, a sudden storm roared and woke Ulan from his sleep. Thinking of the safety of the port equipment, he immediately put on his clothes and rushed to the port. As soon as Ulan got on the floating crane, he and his comrades braved the danger to life and fought bravely against the raging wind, rain, and waves. The typhoon grew stronger, the rain heavier, and the waves higher. Six of the seven steel cables mooring the floating crane were broken, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Ulan and his comrades had only one thought at that moment: they must overcome the storm and protect the largest floating crane in the port. The tense and moving scenes in the film fully demonstrate Ulan's lofty quality of selflessness.

Ulan dares to think and act, fearing no difficulties. During the war, the concrete bridge piers left in the sea hindered the progress of port construction. At this time, Ulan and his comrades, with the revolutionary spirit of the working class daring to think and act, firmly supported the revolutionary initiative to use a 100-ton floating crane to pull out the bridge piers. Without divers and diving suits, Ulan fearlessly jumped into the icy sea and tied the lifting cable to the bottom of the bridge pier, successfully lifting an 18-meter-long bridge pier with the floating crane. When he noticed that "something seemed a bit unusual at the top of the boom," he and his comrade Azem gave up their rest time and came to the floating crane at 3:30 in the morning, climbed up the boom to inspect; when they found that a piece of the pulley had broken, he overcame numerous difficulties and took down a 40-kilogram pulley from the high boom. All of this vividly showcased the heroic spirit of the working class daring to think and act, fearing no difficulties.

Ulan hates evil and is brave in fighting against all negative tendencies. "Every honest communist should fight against evil behavior!" – this is his belief. His uncompromising struggle against bureaucratism and other backward habits and remnants of old ideas shows the high revolutionary principles of a communist.

Ulan is kind-hearted and selfless. On a cold winter night, someone fell into the water at the port. Upon hearing the cries for help, Ulan immediately jumped into the sea and rescued the person.

This outstanding communist, Ulan, is as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "He is a person of noble character, a pure person, a person of integrity, a person who has risen above petty interests, and a person who benefits the people." The film tells us that Ulan was able to become such a person because he constantly and consciously armed his mind with Marxist-Leninist thought, continuously raising his political consciousness. He eagerly and seriously studied the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people. He deeply understood that a member of a Marxist-Leninist party joins the party not to obtain any personal privileges but to undertake more arduous and important tasks. He firmly established the revolutionary outlook on life of fighting for communism and devoting his life to it.

In the battle to protect state property, Ulan gloriously sacrificed his life. However, as he said to his children about the already martyred guerrilla fighters: "They do not sleep; they are always awake." Ulan's brilliant image will forever live in the hearts of the Albanian people and the Chinese people, forever inspiring us to move forward!

Ulan is a representative of outstanding members of the Albanian Labor Party and a representative of the heroic Albanian people. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and made outstanding contributions in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The Albanian Labor Party is indeed a great Marxist-Leninist party, the Albanian people are indeed towering heroes, and the People's Republic of Albania is indeed a strong socialist red fortress standing in Europe. This great socialist beacon of Albania will forever shine brightly. The Chinese people are proud to have such brothers and comrades.

"'Though we are far apart, our hearts are close.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." In the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, the two parties and peoples of China and Albania have forged a deep revolutionary friendship. This great friendship was personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism. It is eternal and unbreakable. The Chinese working class, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever be heart to heart with the Albanian comrades. No matter what happens in the world, the Chinese working class will firmly stand with the Albanian comrades, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. If the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only meet with complete, shameful, and irrevocable failure!

    共产主义战士的颂歌
    ——阿尔巴尼亚故事片《广阔的地平线》观后

    在热烈欢庆英雄的阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年的日子里，我们怀着激动的心情观看了阿尔巴尼亚故事片《广阔的地平线》。这部影片，反映了阿尔巴尼亚海港工人在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的火热的斗争生活，塑造了优秀的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党员、吊车司机乌拉恩的英雄形象。
    我们看着银幕上的乌拉恩的形象，很自然地就想起了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的优秀党员、都拉斯海港浮动起重机手、伟大的共产主义战士——亚当·雷卡。两年前，这个伟大的共产主义战士，在阿尔巴尼亚历史上罕见的暴风雨袭击都拉斯海港的时候，为了保护国家的财产英勇牺牲。影片《广阔的地平线》中的主人公乌拉恩，不就是亚当·雷卡英雄形象的写照吗！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，在参观以雷卡的名字命名的浮吊船时，曾经在留言簿上题词：“雷卡是一个真正的英勇的共产党员。对雷卡来说，党、人民和他自己是三位一体的。”《广阔的地平线》中的乌拉恩，就是这样一个真正的英勇的共产党员的形象。乌拉恩无限忠于党，无限忠于人民，他把自己的一切都献给了党和人民。
    乌拉恩一心为革命。党让他干什么，他就干什么；党需要他到哪里去，他就到哪里去。在法西斯的白色恐怖下，年轻的乌拉恩毅然地参加了游击队，为祖国的解放进行了英勇的斗争。祖国解放后，他又积极响应党的号召，参加祖国的社会主义建设，在一个海港上担任吊车司机。他对工作极端的负责任，对革命事业有高度的责任心。一天凌晨，暴风雨奔腾呼啸地突然降临。正睡在家里的乌拉恩被这突然袭来的暴风雨所惊醒，他想到港口设备的安全，立即披上衣服，向港口奔去。乌拉恩一到浮吊上，便和其他同志一起，冒着生命危险，同狂风恶雨和惊涛骇浪英勇搏斗。台风越刮越猛，暴雨越下越大，海浪越击越高，系泊浮吊的七根钢缆被冲断了六根，情况十分危急。乌拉恩和他的战友当时只有一个念头，就是必须战胜暴风雨，保卫住海港这架最大的浮吊。影片中紧张动人的场面，充分表现了乌拉恩一心为公的崇高品质。
    乌拉恩敢想敢干，不怕困难。战争期间残留在海中的水泥桥桩，阻碍着港口施工的进展。这时，乌拉恩和他的战友发扬了工人阶级敢想敢干的革命精神，坚决支持用百吨浮吊来拔桥桩的革命创议。在没有潜水员和潜水衣的情况下，乌拉恩毫不犹豫地冒着严寒跳入冰冷的海水里，把吊缆系在桥桩的下部，成功地用浮吊吊起了长达十八米的桥桩。当他发觉“吊杆上头好象有点不太正常”，就和他的战友阿兹姆放弃自己的休息时间，早上三点半就来到浮吊，爬上吊杆检查；查出滑轮边碎了一块时，他又克服重重困难，从高高的吊杆上取下了四十公斤重的滑轮。这一切，都生动地展现了工人阶级敢想敢干，不怕困难的英雄本色。
    乌拉恩疾恶如仇，勇于同各种不良倾向作斗争。“每一个正直的共产党员应该同恶劣的行为作斗争！”——这就是他的信念。他对官僚主义等落后习惯和旧思想残余进行的不调和的斗争，显示了一个共产党员的高度的革命原则性。
    乌拉恩助人为乐，舍己救人。一个严寒的夜晚，港口里有人落水。乌拉恩听到呼救声后，就奋不顾身地立即跳进海水，把人救上来。
    乌拉恩这个优秀的共产党员，就如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”影片告诉我们，乌拉恩之所以能够成为这样的人，就是因为他经常自觉地以马克思列宁主义思想武装自己的头脑，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟。他如饥似渴地认真学习阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志的著作。他深深懂得：一个马克思列宁主义党的党员，入党决不是为了得到也不可能得到丝毫的个人特权，而是为了担负起更重大的艰巨的任务。他牢固地树立了生为共产主义而战斗，死为共产主义而献身的革命人生观。
    在保护国家财产的战斗中，乌拉恩光荣地献出了自己的生命。但是，正象他和孩子讲到已经英勇牺牲的游击队员时所说的：“他们不睡，他们永远醒着。”乌拉恩的光辉形象，将永远活在阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民的心中，永远鼓舞着我们前进！
    乌拉恩是杰出的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党党员的代表，是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的代表。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了光辉的成就，在反帝反修斗争中作出了杰出的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不愧是伟大的马克思列宁主义的政党，阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧是顶天立地的英雄人民，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国不愧是站立在欧洲的坚强的社会主义的红色堡垒。阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义的明灯，将永远放射出灿烂的光辉。中国人民为有这样的兄弟和战友而感到自豪。
    “‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”中阿两党两国人民在反帝反修的斗争中结下了深厚的革命友谊。这个伟大的友谊，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼得更加坚强的中国工人阶级，永远和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟心连心。不管世界上发生什么事情，我们中国工人阶级都坚决同阿尔巴尼亚兄弟团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。如果美帝、苏修胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，只能遭到彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败！
