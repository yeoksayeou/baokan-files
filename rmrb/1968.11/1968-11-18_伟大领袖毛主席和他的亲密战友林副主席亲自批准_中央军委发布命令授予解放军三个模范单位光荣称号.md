	New China News Agency, November 17th: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin recently personally approved the issuance of an order by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, conferring honorary titles on three model units of the People's Liberation Army. These units are the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, designated as the "Model Company for Loving the People"; the Medical Department of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, designated as the "Advanced Medical Department for Wholeheartedly Serving the People"; and the Tenth Company of a certain unit of the Engineering Corps, designated as the "Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps in the Snowy Highlands, Limitlessly Loyal to Chairman Mao." The order also calls on all military personnel to learn from them.

	The Central Military Commission, in its order conferring the title "Model Company for Loving the People" on the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, pointed out that during a battle to extinguish a mountain fire, the Fourth Company, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, fought bravely and selflessly. Many comrades in the company were injured but continued to fight. Deputy Political Instructor Wang Youkang, and soldiers Xu Tongyao, Ning Fulin, and Wang Huanjin sacrificed their lives. With their blood and lives, they protected the state's property and the people. The Fourth Company has a glorious tradition of loving the people, always loving the people, and maintaining close ties with the masses, with many moving examples of loving the people. It is a model collective that is limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and the people. The order states that to commend the Fourth Company's limitless love for the people and their heroic deeds in bravely extinguishing the mountain fire, the company is awarded the honorary title "Model Company for Loving the People." The order also calls on all military personnel to learn from the Fourth Company. Learn from their limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, their consistent love for the people, and their noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people; learn from their revolutionary heroism of daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire for the people's interests; learn from their high sense of organizational discipline in firmly protecting the people's interests and defending their battle positions to the death.

	The Central Military Commission, in its order conferring the title "Advanced Medical Department for Wholeheartedly Serving the People" on the Medical Department of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, pointed out that the Medical Department, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," faced the troops and the masses, and wholeheartedly served the people, achieving remarkable results. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they broke superstitions, liberated their minds, dared to revolutionize, and were good at revolutionizing. On March 23, 1968, they successfully removed a 90-jin tumor from the abdomen of female cadre Zhang Qiuju, creating a rare miracle in the history of world medicine. The order states that to commend their advanced thoughts and deeds, the Medical Department is awarded the honorary title "Advanced Medical Department for Wholeheartedly Serving the People." The order also calls on all military personnel, especially those on the medical and health front, to learn from the Medical Department. Learn from their firm stance of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, and their resolute execution and brave defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from their noble quality of facing the troops and the masses and wholeheartedly serving the people; learn from their revolutionary spirit of relying on the masses, breaking superstitions, and daring to practice; learn from their scientific attitude of overcoming difficulties, being serious, and meticulous; learn from their fundamental experience of actively applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and letting politics guide technology.

	The Central Military Commission, in its order conferring the title "Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps in the Snowy Highlands, Limitlessly Loyal to Chairman Mao" on the Tenth Company of a certain unit of the Engineering Corps, pointed out that the Tenth Company, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle," has been fighting for 18 years in the windy and snowy highlands of southwest and northwest China, enduring hardships, braving the elements, and conquering treacherous mountains and rivers. They have overcome scorching heat and bitter cold, excellently completing the tasks of participating in the construction of the Kangding-Qinghai Highway and national defense projects. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad masses of the left. They have been evaluated as a Four-Good Company for seven consecutive years, setting a good example for our army in the socialist revolution and socialist construction period, continuing to maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The order states that to commend the Tenth Company's advanced thoughts and deeds, the company is awarded the honorary title "Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps in the Snowy Highlands, Limitlessly Loyal to Chairman Mao." The order also calls on all military personnel to learn from the Tenth Company. Learn from their firm stance of limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from their revolutionary heroism of enduring hardships, tolerating hard work, not fearing difficulties, and overcoming difficulties; learn from their fine style of loving the people and maintaining close ties with the masses; learn from their fundamental experience of actively applying Mao Zedong Thought and focusing on revolutionary construction.

	The Central Military Commission's order calls on all military personnel to take "Model Company for Loving the People," "Advanced Medical Department for Wholeheartedly Serving the People," and "Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps in the Snowy Highlands, Limitlessly Loyal to Chairman Mao" as examples. They should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry forward the fine tradition of our Party and Army of maintaining close ties with the masses, and in the tasks of defending the motherland and "three supports, two militaries," and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.
