The sun was already high, but Liu Zhaohong, a member of the Nan Shi Brigade of the Ren He People's Commune in Rongcheng County, Shandong, had not yet gone up the mountain. His wife was getting impatient and asked, "What's wrong with you? The sun is already up, and you haven't gone up the mountain yet?" The old man didn't say a word and continued to twist his straw rope. His wife was puzzled: "What's going on? Usually, he goes up the mountain before dawn, but today there must be a reason." She prepared the meal and went straight to the brigade leader's house.

Before the brigade leader could speak, Liu's wife asked, "What's wrong with my husband? Why isn't he going up the mountain?" The brigade leader smiled and said, "Just let him fight against his selfishness a bit!" Liu's wife was still confused, and the accountant chimed in: "It's like this: yesterday morning while digging sweet potatoes, Uncle Zhaohong's hoe fell off, and he took a long time to fix it. In the evening, they deducted half a work point from him. That's why Uncle Zhaohong got angry and left." Liu's wife heard this and understood what had happened!

In the evening, the small oil lamp was lit, and Liu's wife's Mao Zedong Thought study class began again. The old woman personally presided over today's class. She said, "Follow Chairman Mao's words, everyone must dig out the 'private' roots and not hide the 'private' tail." Zhaohong looked at the open copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the table, his mouth puffing on a small tobacco pipe, thinking about how to speak. His youngest son spoke first: "Father must fight against his 'private' thoughts and not hide the 'private' tail." Zhaohong heard his name mentioned and said, "What tail? Why did they deduct half a work point from me?" The old woman said, "This is not about half a work point; this is a struggle between two kinds of thoughts. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Serve the people wholeheartedly.' The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, says that having a bit of selfishness is okay. Look at you, fighting over this half work point, what is that?" "You've fallen for Liu Shaoqi's poison of 'work points in command'!" the youngest son interjected. Zhaohong was already half-convinced but still stubbornly said, "Liu Shaoqi and I are enemies; how could I fall for his poison?" "A small hole can destroy a big dam." His wife retorted. As soon as Liu's wife finished speaking, the youngest son added, "Father! What was your life like in the old society?" This question made Zhaohong pause. The hardships of the old society flashed before his eyes. At seven, he begged for food with his father; at twelve, he worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. Working from dawn till dusk, he could barely get a full meal. It was Chairman Mao who showed us the path of collectivization, giving us a place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. The "private" thought made him forget the collective.

The next day at noon, Zhaohong did not rest and left. His wife was puzzled again: "Why isn't the old man resting during the noon break?" She went out to look and saw a group of young people helping the brigade push sand, with the old man among them.

In the evening, during dinner, Liu's wife deliberately asked, "How many work points did you add today?" Zhaohong waved his hand and said, "Don't talk about work points anymore; that's Liu Shaoqi's black stuff! Today, I did voluntary work and didn't ask for work points!" The two old people looked at each other and smiled knowingly.

　　在家庭学习班里
    天已大亮，山东荣成县人和公社南石大队社员刘昭宏还没上山。老婆子等不得了，问了一句：“你是咋的？日头照着腚了，还不上山？”老头子一声没吭，仍然搓他的草绳。老伴纳闷了：“这是咋回事？往常天没亮就上山了，今儿定有缘故。”她做好饭，直找到队长屋里。
    还没等队长开口，刘大娘就问：“俺聚他爹是咋的，不上山？”队长笑笑说：“叫他斗斗私就好啦！”刘大娘仍然不解，会计在一旁开了腔：“是这么回事，昨天头晌刨地瓜，昭宏叔的镢头掉了，他磨磨蹭蹭钉了老半天才钉好。晚上定分给他减了半分。就这样，昭宏叔赌气走了。”刘大娘一听，原来是这么回事！
    晚上，小油灯亮了，刘大娘家的毛泽东思想学习班又开课了。大娘亲自主持今天的课。她说：“听毛主席的话，都得挖挖‘私’根，可不能藏着个‘私’字尾巴，不往外掏。”昭宏眼瞅着桌面上摊开的《毛主席语录》，嘴里巴嗒巴嗒含着小烟袋锅，心里琢磨着怎个发言法。小儿子先开腔了：“俺爹可得好好斗斗‘私’，可不能把那‘私’字藏了又藏。”昭宏一听点了“名”，就说：“什么尾巴不尾巴的，为啥落人半分工？”大娘就说：“这不是半分工，这是两种思想的斗争。毛主席教导我们说，‘毫不利己专门利人’。叛徒刘少奇却胡说，有点私也行。你看看你争这半分工是什么？”“中了刘少奇鼓吹的‘工分挂帅’的毒！”小儿子插嘴说。昭宏已经软了一半，还硬着嘴说：“刘少奇和咱是死对头，咱那能中他的毒？”“将小比大。小窟窿能毁大堤坝。”老伴一步不让。刘大娘话音刚落，小儿子就接上茬：“爹！旧社会你穷在那上头？”这一提，昭宏的话“咽”住了。旧社会的苦难重现在他的眼前。七岁跟爹讨饭，十二岁当地主的长工。一天干到晚，捞不到一顿饱饭。是毛主席他老人家指引的集体化道路，使俺有房住，有饭吃，有衣穿。“私”字使自己忘了集体。
    第二天中午，昭宏没休息就走了。老伴又纳闷了：“这老头子怎么连午晌也不睡了？”出去一看，一伙小青年给大队推沙，老头子也夹在中间。
    晚上，吃饭的时候，刘大娘故意问：“今晌又加了几个分？”昭宏把手一甩说：“再别分分分的，那是刘少奇的黑货！今晌干义务工，不要分！”两个老人互相看了一眼，会意地笑了。　（王崇先）
