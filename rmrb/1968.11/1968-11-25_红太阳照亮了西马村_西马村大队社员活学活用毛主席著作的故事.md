The red sun shines on Xima Village
—The Story of Xima Village Brigade Members Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works

"Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism in the Field"

This autumn, the Xima Village Brigade in Shilin Commune, Henan Province, achieved a bumper harvest. During the joyous harvest season, many community members discussed the half-mu of corn harvested from the "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" field in the first production team. They said, "The corn harvested from this half-mu of land is not ordinary corn; it is the fruit of the proletarian 'public' spirit."

The incident occurred in May of this year. At that time, the first production team planted eggplants on this piece of collective grain land. Because the collective grain land was reduced, a big debate arose among all the team members.

One evening, the community members gathered in the first production team's office to discuss the matter. The veteran poor peasant Liu Rong first sharply criticized the team leader. At that time, someone disagreed with Liu Rong's criticism and interjected, "The land belongs to the collective, and planting vegetables on collective grain land is nothing special!" Liu Rong responded to this opinion by saying, "Planting grain and planting eggplants on collective grain land are two different things. Collective grain land is responsible for delivering grain to the state and selling surplus grain. If all this land is planted with grain, we can deliver more grain to the state and sell more surplus grain; if we change to planting vegetables, we will harvest less grain, and the state will suffer losses. Moreover, the production team has collective vegetable land. Planting vegetables on collective grain land means falling into the trap of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the number one capitalist-roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not do this!" The brigade's poor peasant representative assembly chairman, Liu Deyu, proposed to pull out the eggplants and plant grain instead. The team's Mao Zedong Thought study guide, Liu Xiang, immediately agreed with Liu Deyu's suggestion, saying, "Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism must be done without delay. The eggplants that have been planted must be pulled out as quickly as possible. We are not pulling out eggplants; we are pulling out the roots of selfishness and revisionism!" Liu Xiang's words sparked a round of enthusiastic applause.

The team leader, enlightened by everyone, voluntarily admitted his mistake. He said sadly, "I did not study and apply Chairman Mao's works well and led everyone down the wrong path. Tomorrow, we will hold a criticism meeting in the eggplant field, severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism, and eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism he spread, so that the spirit of 'public' can take root in our team forever."

The next day, after all the community members held a criticism meeting in the eggplant field, they immediately pulled out the eggplants and planted corn. They also erected a wooden sign at the field's edge, describing the process of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, so that everyone could receive education continuously.

Li Grandma Builds a Treasure Bookstand

In the third production team of Xima Village Brigade, Li Xinping, a 60-year-old poor peasant, built a treasure bookstand at home. She neatly placed Chairman Mao's works on the treasure bookstand and respectfully hung a portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall next to the bookstand, with couplets on either side. Every day, in front of the treasure bookstand, she reported to Chairman Mao in the morning and summarized her work in the evening, following Chairman Mao's teachings to constantly fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.

A few days later, she noticed that the wall was not clean, so she immediately repainted it and rearranged the treasure bookstand.

A few days later, after visiting other poor and lower-middle peasants' treasure bookstands, she rearranged the treasure bookstand for the third time, drawing a radiant red sun on the wall.

That night, Li Grandma was so excited that she couldn't sleep. She thought of the hardships of the old society. At that time, her husband had worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for half his life but still lacked food and clothing. After liberation, her entire family completely overturned their situation, built six new rooms, and their lives improved day by day. Thinking of this, she immediately got up, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your wise leadership that has given me today. I will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, following the bright path you have shown us to the end." She rebuilt the treasure bookstand that night.

The next day, a golden treasure bookstand was completed. Li Grandma was overjoyed and received praise from all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the team.

Gui Qing's Mother Puts Pigs in a Pen

In the past, the people of Xima Village Brigade did not have the habit of penning pigs. Pigs ran freely in the streets, affecting the village's hygiene and damaging the collective crops. Therefore, in July of this year, everyone decided to pen the pigs.

Gui Qing's mother penned the pigs for two days, then, citing the reason that penning pigs would make the pigs thin, released them again.

In the evening, during the family's Mao Zedong Thought study class, nine-year-old girl Hai Feng criticized her mother. She said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'never seek personal gain and always strive for the collective good,' but you haven't gotten rid of your selfishness and released the pigs to eat the collective crops." The twelve-year-old elder child, Gui Qing, added, "Mom, you said you would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, but why do you harm the collective interests?"

Gui Qing's mother's husband, Sun Tinglan, was inspired by the children's speeches. He voluntarily admitted his mistake, saying, "I am also responsible for the pigs. I saw the pigs in the field and did not drive them back home in time. This is an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the collective interests and should be examined."

Everyone studied Chairman Mao's quotations together, compared Gui Qing's mother's erroneous thoughts, and helped her, making her convinced. Finally, she sincerely admitted her mistake. She said, "I only saw myself and did not see the collective crops. What I did does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. I accept the criticism and will sever ties with the bourgeois 'self' from now on."

From then on, Gui Qing's mother's pigs were never seen running out again.

    红太阳照亮了西马村
    ——西马村大队社员活学活用毛主席著作的故事
    “斗私批修田”
    今年秋季，河南省鹤壁市石林公社西马村大队获得了丰收。社员们在喜庆丰收的时候，许多人都谈论到第一生产队三亩半“斗私批修田”收获的玉米。他们说：“这三亩半地收下的不是普通的玉米，是无产阶级的‘公’字结下的硕果。”
    事情发生在今年五月。当时，第一生产队把这块集体粮食耕地种上了茄子。因为缩小了集体粮食耕地面积，在全队社员中引起了一场大辩论。
    一天晚上，社员们聚集在第一生产队办公室讨论这件事。老贫农刘荣首先对生产队长提出了尖锐的批评。当时，有人不同意刘荣的批评，插话说：“官土打官墙，集体粮食耕地集体种菜算不了什么！”刘荣针对这个意见，接着说：“集体粮食耕地种粮食和种茄子是两回事。集体粮食耕地担负着向国家交公粮、卖余粮的任务，这些地全种上粮食，就能向国家多交公粮，多卖余粮；改种菜，就少收了粮食，国家就要受损失，何况生产队又有集体菜地。在集体粮食耕地上种菜，就中了党内头号走资派刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义黑货的毒，我们贫下中农坚决不能干！”大队贫代会主任刘得玉提议把茄子拔掉，种上粮食。队里学习毛主席著作辅导员刘香，马上赞同刘得玉的主张，说：“斗私批修，要只争朝夕。种上的茄子，要拔得越快越好。我们拔的不是茄子，而是私根、修根！”刘香的话，激起了一片热烈的掌声。
    生产队长在大家的启发下，主动检查了错误。他难过地说：“我没有很好地活学活用毛主席著作，把大家领到邪路上去了。明天我们就在茄子地里开个批判会，狠批刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义的罪行，肃清他散布的反革命修正主义毒素，让‘公’字永远在我们队扎根。”
    第二天，全体社员在茄子地头开过批判会后，立即把茄子拔掉，种上了玉米。他们还在地头竖起一块木牌，上边写着斗私批修的经过，使大家能经常受到教育。
    李大娘四建宝书台
    西马村大队第三生产队六十多岁的贫农老大娘李新玲，在家里建立了一座宝书台。她把毛主席著作整整齐齐地放在宝书台上，又恭恭敬敬地把毛主席像挂在宝书台旁边的墙上，两边挂上对联。她每天在宝书台前面，对着毛主席像早请示，晚汇报，按照毛主席的教导，经常斗私批修。
    没几天，她发现墙上不太干净，马上动手把墙壁粉刷了一遍，重新布置了宝书台。
    又过几天，她参观了别的贫下中农家的宝书台后，又动手进行第三次布置，在墙上画了一个光芒四射的红太阳。
    这天晚上，李大娘激动得翻来复去睡不着。她想起了旧社会的苦难。那时，她老伴给地主扛了半辈子长工，还是缺吃少用。解放后，她全家彻底翻了身，盖了六间新房，生活一天比一天好。想到这里，她立即起身，站在毛主席像前说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您老人家的英明领导，俺才有了今天。我要永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，照着您指引的光明大道走到底。”她连夜又一次重建宝书台。
    第二天，一座金光闪闪的宝书台建成了。李大娘满心高兴，也得到了全队贫下中农的赞扬。
    桂青娘圈猪
    过去，西马村大队的群众没有圈猪的习惯。猪满街乱跑，既影响村里的卫生，又损坏集体的庄稼。因此，今年七月，大伙决定把猪圈起来。
    第四生产队的桂青娘把猪圈了两天，借口圈猪会把猪圈瘦，又放了出来。
    晚上，在家庭毛泽东思想学习班里，九岁的女孩子海凤对母亲提出了批评。她说：“毛主席教导我们要‘毫不利己专门利人’，可是你的私心就没有去掉，把猪放出来啃集体庄稼。”十二岁的大孩子桂青接着说：“妈，你不是说要永远忠于毛主席吗？毛主席教导咱们，要斗私，批修，你咋还损害集体利益？”
    桂青娘的丈夫孙廷兰听了孩子们的发言，很受启发。他主动作检查说：“咱的猪放出去我也有责任。我见猪在地里，没有及时撵回家，这是对集体利益极不负责的态度，应该检查。”
    大家一起学习毛主席语录，对照桂青娘的错误思想，对她进行帮助，说得桂青娘心服口服。最后，她诚恳地承认了错误。她说：“我光看到自己，没有看到集体的庄稼。我这样做，不符合毛主席的教导。我接受批评，今后和资产阶级的‘私’字一刀两断。”
    从此，桂青娘的猪再也不见跑出来了。
