The night of November 1st was a night of fervor. On the construction site of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians sang and danced, celebrating the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

Among the jubilant crowds on both banks of the Yangtze River was a heroic platoon—the "Red First Platoon" of the Engineering Corps of the Nanjing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. This platoon was founded in 1930 by our great leader Chairman Mao when he led the Red Army to Anshan, based on more than eighty Anshan miners. At 8:30 PM, when the radio broadcast the news that the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee unanimously decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party and revoke all his positions within and outside the Party, the soldiers of the "Red First Platoon" jumped for joy. Everyone spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao a thousand times!" Everyone said that the resolution of the plenum spoke the words in the hearts of the descendants of the Anshan workers!

At this moving moment, the great leader Chairman Mao led the Anshan workers in their heroic struggle and led the people of the entire country from victory to victory in this great revolutionary practice. The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's crimes of betraying the Anshan workers and his mad opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, his attempt to restore capitalism, all appeared before the eyes of the entire platoon. The love and hate of the proletariat intertwined in the hearts of the soldiers. With immense emotion, they gathered in front of the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" to express their determination to the great leader Chairman Mao: We will definitely follow you bravely forward, learn from the revolutionary forebears, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, thoroughly settle accounts with the traitorous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, and will not rest until we thoroughly purge the poison of revisionism spread by Liu Shaoqi!

The camp was in turmoil. The soldiers forgot the fatigue of the intense construction work and, with strong class hatred and unyielding fighting spirit, launched a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi. In an instant, those who could write wrote, those who could draw drew, some held criticism meetings, and some performed street plays, all directing their attacks at Liu Shaoqi!

Under the lamplight, a group of soldiers who had never held a brush before sat on their beds and drew caricatures of the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. Soldier Xie Mingbao, known as the "strongman" of the platoon, could easily carry a 200-pound sack of rice as if it were nothing, but holding a pen felt like lifting a thousand pounds. Now, he picked up the pen. He said, "I will fight to the end with the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi! I draw to fight, to make Liu Shaoqi infamous forever!" He remembered that when he enlisted, the political instructor had said that Liu Shaoqi was the chief culprit who sabotaged the revolutionary struggle of the Anshan workers and a big villain who opposed the revolutionary masses from learning Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. He quickly drew a sneering, grimacing portrait of the capitalist-roader.

In another place, many soldiers were writing poems. Squad Leader Kong Derong returned from working on the Yangtze River Bridge construction site at nearly 11 PM. He thought of how the great leader Chairman Mao, in the days of thick fog, came to Anshan and personally guided the Anshan workers to the path of armed struggle. Now, he personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, destroying the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party, and saving the people of the entire country from the suffering of capitalist restoration. His heart was filled with immense emotion. His boundless love for Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi made him forget the fatigue of a day's labor. He picked up his pen and wrote: "Great leader Mao Zedong, wise decision-maker praised by all, purge the waste Liu Shaoqi,..." When he wrote this, Deputy Squad Leader Rui Jianyao came up and said that the last sentence should strike at the heart of Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, has done countless evil deeds, and his counter-revolutionary purpose is one: to attempt to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship! Kong Derong then wrote: "Forever preserve the red power for ten thousand generations!"

In the clubhouse, four soldiers from the platoon's cultural troupe were rehearsing a performance. A few days ago, they performed a street play "Down with Liu Shaoqi," portraying Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary face vividly, which was well-received by the entire platoon. They said: To perform well the play of overthrowing Liu Shaoqi, we must first deeply hate Liu Shaoqi. They heard the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee on the radio and began to discuss writing a drum song to celebrate the publication of the communiqué and support the resolution of the plenum, to express the feelings of the entire platoon. They studied and rehearsed while creating, turning the creative process into a process of criticizing Liu Shaoqi. When writing "the bourgeois headquarters is destroyed," the props man Chen Chuansheng excitedly said, "The Anshan workers' struggle against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the most resolute. In those days, the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi wanted the Anshan workers' patrol team to hand over their weapons to the reactionary Kuomintang, but the Anshan workers stood firm against him, took up arms, and followed Chairman Mao to make revolution. Our platoon was established in this way." Soldier Bian Zhonglin added, "We are the descendants of the Anshan workers and must inherit the glorious tradition of the Anshan workers, respond to the call of the plenum, and hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism." Everyone said, "Yes, this meaning must be included in the performance." The next morning, before work, they brought their newly rehearsed performance to the construction site.

"Rapidly surging, ten thousand horses still in battle." On the second day, the revolutionary criticism of the "Red First Platoon" burned even more fiercely. Political Instructor Lu Guohua invited part of the workers building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge to hold a joint military-civilian meeting to criticize the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. The workers' and soldiers' denunciations of Liu Shaoqi roared like the waves of the Yangtze River, each wave higher than the last.

    一场清算刘少奇反革命罪行的战斗
    ——记南京长江大桥工地上的军民欢呼党的十二中全会公报发表
    十一月一日这一夜，是一个沸腾的夜。在南京长江大桥工地上，成千上万的军民载歌载舞，欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表。
    在长江两岸欢腾的人群中，有一个英雄的连队——人民解放军南京部队工程兵某团“红一连”。这个连队是在一九三○年，我们伟大领袖毛主席率领工农红军去安源时，以八十多名安源矿工为基础，亲手创建的我军第一个工兵连。晚八时半，当收音机里传来党的八届十二中全会一致通过决议，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务的喜讯时，“红一连”的指战员们高兴得跳了起来。大家情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”大家说，全会的决议，说出了咱们安源工人后代的心里话！
    在这激动人心的时刻，伟大领袖毛主席领导安源工人进行英勇的斗争，领导全国人民从胜利走向胜利的伟大革命实践，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇出卖安源工人以及他疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，一一出现在全连指战员的眼前。无产阶级的爱和恨交织在战士们的心头，大家怀着无比激动的心情，聚集在《毛主席去安源》的油画前，向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心：我们一定紧跟您奋勇前进，向英雄的革命前辈学习，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，彻底清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行，不把刘少奇散布的修正主义流毒彻底肃清，决不罢休！
    军营沸腾了，指战员们忘了紧张施工的劳累，怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，以无比高昂的战斗意志，投入了狠批刘少奇的战斗。一时之间，能写的写，会画的画，有的开批判会，有的排活报剧，把矛头一齐指向刘少奇！
    在灯光下，一批从来没有提过画笔的战士，坐在床前给大工贼刘少奇画丑像。战士谢明保，是全连出名的“大力士”，两百斤重的米包，扛在身上跟掂着玩似的，叫他拿笔，却比千斤重。这时，他拿起笔来了。他说：“我要和大工贼刘少奇斗到底！我画画是为了战斗，为了让刘少奇遗臭万年！”他想起入伍时，指导员讲的刘少奇是破坏安源工人革命斗争的罪魁祸首，是反对革命群众学习毛泽东思想的大恶棍。他很快画出了一个呲牙咧嘴的大工贼。
    在另一个地方，许多战士在写诗。九班长孔德荣从长江大桥工地劳动回来，已是半夜十一点多了。他想起伟大领袖毛主席在妖雾弥漫的日子里，来到安源，亲自指引安源工人走武装斗争的道路，现在，又亲自发动、亲自领导无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，从党内清除了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，使全国人民免受资本主义复辟的苦，他心情无比激动。对毛主席的无限热爱，对刘少奇的无比仇恨，使他忘记了劳动一天的疲劳，他提起笔来写道：“伟大领袖毛泽东，英明决策人人颂，清除废料刘少奇，……”写到这里，副班长芮见伢凑上来说，最后一句话要击中刘少奇的心脏。刘少奇这个坏蛋坏事做了千万桩，反革命的目的是一个：妄图颠覆无产阶级的政权！孔德荣便提笔写道：“永保政权万代红！”
    在俱乐部里，连队文艺组的四个战士正在编文艺节目。前些日子，他们演出了一个《打倒刘少奇》的活报剧，把刘少奇的反革命嘴脸演得活灵活现，受到全连同志的好评。他们说：要演好打倒刘少奇的节目，先要把对刘少奇的仇恨搞得深深的。他们从广播里听了党的十二中全会公报，便在一起商量着编一个欢呼公报发表、拥护全会决议的锣鼓词，来表达全连同志的心情。他们边学习边编节目，把创作过程变成了批判刘少奇的过程。当写到“资产阶级司令部被摧毁”时，器材员陈传胜激动地说：“安源工人对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线斗争最坚决。当年，大工贼刘少奇要安源工人纠察队把武器交给国民党反动派，安源工人和他针锋相对，拿起枪杆跟着毛主席闹革命，我们这个连就是这样成立起来的。”战士卞忠林接着说：“咱们是安源工人的后代，也一定要继承安源工人的光荣传统，响应全会的号召，把革命大批判的旗帜举得更高。”大家说：“对，这个意思要在节目里写上。”第二天清晨上工的时刻，他们带着新编的节目，在工地作了演出。
    “奔腾急，万马战犹酣。”二日，“红一连”革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。指导员卢国华邀请建设南京长江大桥的一部分工人，举行了一个军民批判大工贼刘少奇的大会。工人和战士怒斥刘少奇的声浪，如长江波涛，一浪高过一浪。　新华社通讯员
