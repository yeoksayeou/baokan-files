A Small Story from the Great Criticism of the Revolution

Husband and Wife Together Criticize the "Join the Party to Become an Official" Theory

Southern Unit 176, Red Guard Literature

The wife of Maoyadufu, the squad leader of the 3rd Platoon of the 6th Company, heard from others at home that Maoyadufu had been in the army for seven years and had long since joined the party, and was probably now an officer. It was only recently, after she came to the unit to visit her husband, that she learned that Maoyadufu was still a soldier. She asked Maoyadufu, "Some comrades have been in the army for less time than you, but have already become officers. Why are you still a soldier?" Maoyadufu heard this and knew that his wife's mind was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory. If he did not help her thoroughly cleanse it, she would be in danger of sliding into the quagmire of revisionism.

That evening, Maoyadufu took out the shiny "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied with his wife: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the interests of the people." Then, he used the shining example of Comrade Zhang Zedong, who had been in the army for twelve years and had always worked selflessly for the revolution by burning good coal, to enlighten his wife. He asked, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people. What should we do?" His wife replied without hesitation, "Of course, we should resolutely carry it out!" Maoyadufu continued, "Right! So, if one joins the party but does not become an official, can one completely and thoroughly serve the people?" This question made his wife suddenly realize the truth, and she lowered her head and remained silent. Maoyadufu saw that his wife's thoughts had awakened, and following Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," he seized the opportunity to say, "Xuexia! You and I are like bitter gourds on the same vine. The evil old society took the lives of several of my brothers and sisters, leaving only one sister, who was given away as a child bride. As for your family, isn't it even worse? You spent the whole year without cotton clothes in winter, barefoot in summer, not enough to eat during the day, and rolling in straw at night..."

After a pause, he spoke earnestly, "We must never forget our painful past, lest we forget our history of blood and tears!" These words stirred up his wife's painful memories, reminding her of her father's twelve years of suffering as a laborer for the landlord before liberation. Then, Maoyadufu said, "Think about the past and compare it with the present. It is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao that we have everything. We should dedicate everything to Chairman Mao. But the heinous Liu Shaoqi used the 'join the party to become an official' theory as a poison to corrupt us, trying to turn us into extreme individualists seeking fame and fortune, into 'officials' who lord it over the people, thereby achieving his evil goal of restoring capitalism. If that happens, we poor and lower-middle peasants will have to endure the bitter days of 'holding a rice bowl with no rice to wash, and stepping on the stove with no firewood to burn.' Do you think we can allow that?" Maoyadufu's wife became more and more excited as she listened, and she replied firmly, "We absolutely cannot allow it! You joining the party and me joining the league are all for the revolution, for socialism and communism, and for completely and thoroughly serving the people. We must not be like what Liu Shaoqi advocates, joining the party to 'become an official.'"

Husband and wife spoke to each other, the more they criticized, the more they hated the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi; the more they studied, the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao. Finally, both of them were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes, and they could not help but walk to the portrait of Chairman Mao and say in unison, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Please rest assured that we will definitely thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's 'join the party to become an official' theory, cleanse the poison, and firmly establish the idea of joining the party for the revolution. We will always be loyal to you, to your great thoughts, and to your proletarian revolutionary line."

The poison in the body, the heavier the heart, the more red the heart to cleanse the poison. On the day Maoyadufu's wife returned home, she saw that Maoyadufu had no cloth to mend shoes for his comrades in the company, so she immediately gave all her cloth coupons, which she had prepared to buy clothes, to Maoyadufu. She also repeatedly encouraged Maoyadufu to study Chairman Mao's thoughts diligently, to focus on the "use" of them, and to be like the heroes Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Li Wenzhong, and Menghe, who did not seek fame or fortune, but dedicated everything to the revolution. She urged him to guard the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, to stand guard, to fight well, and to smash the reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory spread by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi with actual actions.

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

　　夫妻同批“入党做官论”
　　南字一七六部队　红兵文
    六连三班长姚大富的爱人在家听别人说，姚大富入伍七年了，早就入了党，现在大概是个干部了。直到最近她来部队探亲后，才知道姚大富同志仍然是个战士。她问姚大富：“有的同志军龄还没有你的党龄长，为啥人家都当了干部，你还是个战士呢？”姚大富一听，知道这是他爱人头脑里有刘少奇反动的“入党做官论”的流毒，如果不帮她彻底肃清，就有滑进修正主义泥坑的危险。
    晚上，姚大富掏出金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》和爱人一起学了起来：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”接着，他又用张思德同志入伍十二年如一日，不为名不为利，一心一意为革命烧好炭的光辉事迹，启发他爱人。他问：“毛主席教导我们要‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务，我们应该怎么办？”他爱人毫不含糊地说：“这还要问，当然应该坚决照办！”姚大富紧接着说：“对！那么入党不做官，能不能完全彻底地为人民服务呀？！”这一问，使他爱人猛然醒悟了，低着头默默不语。姚大富看出爱人思想有了觉悟，又遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，趁热打铁地说：“学霞！你和我都是一根藤上的苦瓜。万恶的旧社会夺去了我几个哥哥、姐姐的生命，剩下的一个姐姐，还给人家当了童养媳。提起你家，不是比俺家更苦吗？整年过着冬天无棉衣，夏天打赤膊，白天吃不饱，夜间滚稻草的苦日子……。”停了一会，他又语重心长地说：“我们可千万不能好了疮疤忘了痛，丢掉这本血泪史啊！”一席话，激起了他爱人痛苦的回忆，使她想起了自己的父亲解放前给地主当长工所受过的十二年煎熬。接着，姚大富又说：“想想过去，比比现在，这完全是党和毛主席给了我们一切，我们应该把一切献给毛主席。可是，罪恶滔天的刘少奇却用‘入党做官论’这剂砒霜毒害我们，妄图把我们腐蚀成追求名利的极端利己主义者，变成骑在人民头上作威作福的‘官老爷’，从而达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。那样，我们贫下中农就要重过那种‘手拿饭箩没米淘，脚踏灶前没柴烧’的苦日子。你说，我们能答应吗？”姚大富的爱人越听越激动，她斩钉截铁地回答说：“坚决不答应！你入党，我入团，都是为了革命，为了社会主义和共产主义事业，为了完全彻底地为人民服务。决不能象刘少奇所鼓吹的入党是为了‘做官’。”夫妻俩你一言，我一语，越批，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇越恨；越学，对伟大领袖毛主席越亲。最后俩人都激动得热泪盈眶，情不自禁地走到毛主席像前，异口同声地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！请您老人家放心吧，我们一定彻底批倒、批臭刘少奇的‘入党做官论’，肃清流毒，牢固地树立入党为革命的思想，永远忠于您，忠于您的伟大思想，忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。”
    流毒在身私心重，肃清流毒心更红。姚大富爱人回家的那天，见姚大富给连里同志补鞋子没布，就毫不犹豫地把自己准备买衣服的五尺布票全给了姚大富。她还再三勉励姚大富要好好活学活用毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫，要象雷锋、王杰、李文忠、门合等英雄人物那样，一不为名，二不为利，一切为革命，一心为革命，党叫干啥就干啥。为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，以实际行动粉碎大叛徒刘少奇散布的反动的“入党做官论”。
