The Qiqihaer Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directive that "the working class must lead everything." They have fully mobilized the creativity and leadership abilities of the working class, organizing workers to form inspection teams to thoroughly check the progress of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to promote the deepening of these efforts. Recently, guided by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, they have summarized the experiences of the workers' inspection teams and are determined to better utilize the role of these teams to thoroughly complete the great battle tasks outlined in the communiqué.

On October 5, the factory revolutionary committee convened a meeting of all workshop, team, and group leaders to discuss issues related to the factory's financial and economic management. During the meeting, these frontline cadres felt that while the factory's revolutionary and production situation had been good, there were still problems in the financial and economic sector. They proposed to assist the revolutionary committee in investigating these issues. The leaders of the factory revolutionary committee present at the meeting agreed that as long as these issues were handed over to the workers, they could be resolved. The next day, revolutionary workers from all 25 workshops and units in the factory held extensive discussions and elected representatives who were staunch advocates of Mao Zedong Thought, who emphasized proletarian politics, and who had revolutionary spirit, to form a 25-person workers' inspection team.

"The working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Under the direct leadership of the factory revolutionary committee and with the active support of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, the workers' inspection team, guided by Chairman Mao's latest directives, focused on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They adhered to the principles of facilitating workers' participation in management, emphasizing proletarian politics, and developing productive forces, and conducted a comprehensive inspection of the factory's financial and economic situation. During the inspection, they discovered not only problems in the financial and economic sector but also related issues in other areas that needed to be addressed urgently. For example, some units had poor class struggle, leading to disorder in warehouse management and material distribution; other units had shallow revolutionary criticism, slow progress in reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, and incomplete reforms. The workers' inspection team promptly reported these situations to the factory revolutionary committee. The committee members were deeply moved and realized that the workers had the closest grasp of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the deepest understanding, and the most accurate view of the problems in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They were truly the main force in carrying out these efforts. Only by fully relying on the broad masses of workers could the struggle, criticism, and transformation be thoroughly carried out. Therefore, the factory revolutionary committee decided to expand the scope of the workers' inspection team to comprehensively inspect the situation of the struggle, criticism, and transformation and to promote these efforts across the board.

Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, the workers' inspection team inspected the implementation of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and the "Anshan Constitution," the conduct of revolutionary criticism, and the reform of unreasonable regulations and systems. In just four days, the workers' inspection team inspected seven areas of work and discovered 73 problems, large and small. The inspection team promptly helped to resolve the issues they uncovered. Many long-standing problems, some of which had not been resolved for over a decade, were finally addressed. Previously, the tool workshop produced wedges with insufficient hardness, which users found unsatisfactory, but the issue had not been resolved for a long time. The root cause was that the revisionist rules and regulations had not been broken, leading to poor communication between workshops and the inability to promptly improve production based on user requirements. This time, the workers' inspection team helped the revolutionary workers in the tool workshop to carry out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, breaking the "close, block, and suppress" revisionist system, and forming a visiting team to visit nine user workshops to gather opinions. This completely changed the previous situation of poor communication and established a new type of relationship between workshops, quickly improving the quality of the wedges produced by the tool workshop. The workers' inspection team promptly summarized the experience of the tool workshop in deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, breaking old systems, and daring to reform, and promoted this experience wherever they went. They became a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and a shock troop for the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Workers enthusiastically praised, "The workers' inspection team is a good way for the working class to directly participate in enterprise management and fully play a leading role. It is also a good form for us workers to educate ourselves and continuously improve our political consciousness." The revolutionary practice of the workers' inspection team greatly inspired the enthusiasm of all workers in the factory. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, in less than a month, nearly a thousand workers formed inspection teams for the struggle, criticism, and transformation, spreading throughout the factory.

Under the strong promotion of the workers' inspection team, the mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation flourished. The entire factory saw a new situation where every revolutionary worker cared about the struggle, criticism, and transformation and made revolutionary suggestions. Chairman Mao's latest directives were further implemented, unreasonable regulations and systems were smashed one by one, and new enterprise management systems were established one by one. The revolutionary and production situation continued to improve, powerfully demonstrating the boundless wisdom and strength of the working class leading everything.

After the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, the factory revolutionary committee, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, used the communiqué as a weapon to review and summarize the experiences of utilizing the leading role of the working class and organizing workers' inspection teams to promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They believed that this was a new thing that emerged in the factory's mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They are determined to better utilize the role of the workers' inspection teams, to better rely on the working class, to thoroughly complete the battle tasks of each stage of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    本报讯　齐齐哈尔车辆工厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚决落实毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大指示，充分发挥工人阶级的创造智慧和领导才能，发动工人群众组成工人检查组，对全厂斗、批、改情况进行大检查，使毛主席最新指示进一步落实，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。最近，他们在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报引导下，总结了这方面的经验，决心更好地发挥工人检查组的作用，彻底完成公报提出的各项伟大战斗任务。
    今年十月五日，厂革委会为了更好地落实毛主席关于“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，就工厂财经方面存在的问题，召集全厂各车间班、组长进行研究。会上，这些来自斗争第一线的骨干们觉得，工厂革命、生产形势一直很好，为什么在财经方面还出了问题呢？他们提出要协助革委会对这个问题进行检查。参加会议的厂革委会领导成员觉得，只要把这个问题交给工人群众，就有了解决的办法了。于是，当即表示坚决支持工人提出的这一革命建议。第二天，全厂二十五个车间、单位的革命职工进行了充分讨论，推选了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、有革命干劲的工人代表，组成了二十五人的工人检查组。
    “工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”工人检查组在厂革委会的直接领导和驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的积极支持下，以毛主席一系列最新指示为指针，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，本着有利于工人参加管理，有利于突出无产阶级政治，有利于发展生产力的原则，对全厂财经情况做了普遍检查。检查中，他们发现不仅财经方面存在问题，与此有关的其他方面也存在一些急需解决的问题。例如，有的单位由于阶级斗争抓得不狠，仓库保管、物资发放秩序混乱；还有的单位革命大批判搞得不深入，改革不合理规章制度动作迟缓，改得不彻底，等等。工人检查组把这些情况及时向厂革委会做了汇报。革委会领导成员震动很大，深深感到：工人群众对毛主席最新指示跟得最紧，理解得最深，对斗、批、改中的问题看得最准，不愧为搞好斗、批、改的主力军。只有全心全意地依靠广大工人群众，才能彻底搞好斗、批、改。因此，厂革委会做出决定：工人检查组的检查范围要扩大，要全面检查斗、批、改的情况，全面推动斗、批、改。
    在厂革委会的领导下，工人检查组检查了落实毛主席“五·七”指示和“鞍钢宪法”、开展革命大批判、改革不合理规章制度中的情况和问题。短短的四天时间，工人检查组就检查了七项工作，发现了大小七十三个问题。工人检查组对检查出的问题，雷厉风行地帮助解决。有许多“老大难”问题，甚至十多年一直没有得到解决的问题，这次也得到了解决。过去，工具车间生产的角锥硬度不够，用户车间很有意见，但长时间得不到解决。根本原因是修正主义的条条、框框没有破除，造成车间与车间之间互不往来，不能及时根据用户车间的要求改进生产。这次，工人检查组帮助工具车间的革命职工，开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义办企业路线，大破了“关、卡、压”的修正主义制度，组成了访问小组，到九个用户车间去征求意见，彻底改变了过去那种互不往来的状况，建立了车间与车间之间的新型关系，工具车间生产的角锥质量很快有了提高。工人检查组及时总结了工具车间深入开展革命大批判、破字当头、敢破敢立的经验，到那里检查，就把这个经验推广到那里，他们成了一支毛泽东思想宣传队，成了斗、批、改的突击队。工人们热情赞扬说：“工人检查组是工人阶级直接参加企业管理、充分发挥领导作用的一种好办法，也是我们工人自己教育自己，不断提高政治觉悟的一种好形式。”工人检查组的革命实践，极大地激发了全厂工人的积极性，在革委会的领导下，不到一个月的时间，一支近千人组成的工人检查斗、批、改的大军迅速地遍布全厂。
    在工人检查组的有力推动下，斗批改群众运动蓬勃展开。全厂出现革命职工人人关心斗、批、改，个个提革命建议的崭新气象，毛主席的最新指示进一步落实，不合理的规章制度一个一个被砸烂，崭新的企业管理制度一个个地建立起来，革命、生产形势越来越好，有力地显示了工人阶级领导一切的无限智慧和力量。
    十二中全会公报发表后，厂革委会在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以全会公报为武器，检查、总结了发挥工人阶级领导作用、组织工人检查组推动斗、批、改的经验，他们认为：这是工厂斗、批、改群众运动中涌现出来的新生事物。他们决心更好地发挥工人检查组的作用，更好地依靠工人阶级，彻底完成斗、批、改各个阶段的战斗任务，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
