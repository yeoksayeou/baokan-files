Under the heavy oppression and exploitation of U.S. imperialism and the local feudal lords, the rubber workers and peasants in the Bolivian rubber plantations live a miserable life of toil and suffering.

The eastern part of Bolivia, the Rio Negro (Black River) region, is a famous rubber-producing area. The peasants and workers there labor like slaves. They work from dawn till dusk every day. If they fail to complete the daily task of producing twenty-five pounds of rubber, they are labeled as "saboteurs of the enterprise" and are whipped. Despite their backbreaking labor, they receive only three pieces of clothing as their annual wage.

The workers' wages are determined by the boss's own accounts. The only inheritance the rubber workers receive is the debt left by their ancestors. After their ancestors die, they have to work to pay off these debts. They often work to "repay" the debts left by their parents.

In the Rio Negro region, the child mortality rate is very high. Out of every ten children born, seven die before reaching the age of five. One often sees the following scene: children are completely naked, huddled around a fire pit, with a pack of hungry dogs beside them. The parents explain, "The dogs are warming our children, so they won't freeze to death."

With the intrusion of the U.S. imperialist claws, the suffering of the laboring people in Rio Negro has intensified. The American "Rever" company is engaged in ruthless plunder here, forcing workers to move into the rubber plantations and develop rubber using slave labor. These workers have only obligations and no rights; even the workers and their families can be sold by one rubber plantation owner to another.

　　玻利维亚橡胶园里的饥饿和奴役
    在美帝国主义和本国封建主的重重压迫和剥削下，玻利维亚橡胶园里的橡胶工人和农民过着血泪斑斑的牛马生活。
    玻利维亚东部的里约内格罗（黑河）是一个出名的橡胶区。那里的农民和工人象奴隶一样劳动着。他们每天从清早干活直到天黑。如果不能完成每天出二十五磅橡胶的任务，就被认为是“企业的破坏者”，遭到鞭打。这样流汗卖命，所得的只是每年发一次工资，也就是三件衣服。
    工人干活，由老板凭自己的账发工资。橡胶工人唯一承继的遗产，是他们上辈的遗债。上辈死后，他们必须以劳力来抵偿。他们常常为“偿还”父母遗留下来的债务干活。
    在里约内格罗，儿童的死亡率很高。每生下十个孩子，就有七个不满五岁便死掉。人们常可看到这样的景象：孩子们完全赤裸着身子，蜷缩在一个火塘周围，他们身旁是一群饿狗。孩子的父母这样解释说：“这是狗要给咱们孩子暖气，不让他们冻死啊。”
    随着美帝魔爪的侵入，里约内格罗劳动人民的苦难又加重了。美国“雷弗”公司在这里进行疯狂的掠夺，它们强迫工人们把家搬进橡胶园，用奴隶劳工方式开发橡胶。这些工人只有义务，没有权利，甚至工人连同他的家庭都可以被一个橡胶园主卖给另一个橡胶园主。（彦斑）
