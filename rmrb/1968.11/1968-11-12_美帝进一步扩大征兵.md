The U.S. imperialists, while colluding with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique to play the "peace talks" trick on the Vietnam issue, are continuing to accelerate their military buildup and war preparations.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 7th that 26,800 new recruits will be called up in January next year. This will be the highest number since May of this year.

According to reports from the U.S. news agency, the average monthly conscription next year will be over 25,000, totaling 153,000 for the first half of the year, nearly double the total conscription for the second half of this year.

　　美帝进一步扩大征兵
    美帝国主义在勾结苏修叛徒集团在越南问题上大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局的同时，正继续加紧扩军备战。
    美国国防部七日宣布，明年一月份将征召二万六千八百名新兵入伍。这将是今年五月份以来的最高数字。
    据美国通讯社透露，明年上半年的每月征兵额平均在二万五千人以上，总数将达到十五万三千人，比今年下半年的征兵总额高出将近一倍。
