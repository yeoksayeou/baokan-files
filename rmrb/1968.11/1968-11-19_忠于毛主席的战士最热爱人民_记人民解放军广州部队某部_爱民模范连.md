Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin recently personally approved and the Central Military Commission issued an order, conferring the honorable title of "Model Platoon for Loving the People" on the Fourth Platoon of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. This platoon is a heroic collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loves the people.

In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire Fourth Platoon used their brave actions to compose a triumphant song that resonated through the clouds. With hearts filled with infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, they engaged in a fierce battle against a raging mountain fire, using their blood and lives to protect the safety of the people's lives and property and to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Deputy Political Instructor Wang Youkang and soldiers Xu Tongyao, Ning Fulin, and Wang Huangjin sacrificed their young lives in this battle.

The comrades of the Fourth Platoon have put into practice their oath: "For Chairman Mao's instructions, we will study and implement them without deviation. For Chairman Mao's battle commands, we will respond promptly and advance fearlessly."

The heroic deeds of the comrades of the Fourth Platoon are a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and a result of implementing Vice Chairman Lin's principles and policies on political construction of the military.

"With us here, we cannot let state property be damaged!"

Early this year, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the northern part of Guangdong Province, under the call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, were full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and welcoming the spring of battle.

On the afternoon of January 15, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon were holding a meeting to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought when suddenly they heard shouts from afar: "The mountain is on fire! Quick, put out the fire!" The soldiers saw flames burning fiercely in the northern mountains, and the north wind carried black smoke and ash, threatening nearby villages and vast state-owned pine forests.

Fire is the order! The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon loudly read Chairman Mao's teaching: "To serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army," and resolutely declared: "With us here, we cannot let state property be damaged!" They immediately set out and rushed to the fire scene.

The north wind howled, and the flames soared into the sky. The soldiers, who had fiercely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's "philosophy of survival" during the Cultural Revolution, were fearless in the face of the raging fire. They charged into the smoke and flames, rushing towards the most dangerous places; where the fire was fiercest, they charged in. Some had their clothes burned, their hands blistered, but they paid no heed; some had their hair burned, their faces blistered, but they did not retreat a single step. On the branches used to beat out the fire, there were pieces of the heroes' skin and blood. They proudly said: "The fire can burn trees and rocks, but it cannot scare away the heroes who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and serve the people wholeheartedly!"

Soldier Ning Fulin was small but had a big heart. He often said: "Revolution is not afraid of death, and those who fear death are not revolutionaries!" He was always at the forefront of everything, and everyone called him "Little Cannonball." He had been suffering from a cold for three days, but upon hearing about the fire, he forgot his illness and rushed to the fire scene like an arrow. The platoon leader did not let him go, but he said: "Saving the people's property is more important; I will crawl if I have to!" As soon as he arrived at the fire scene, he swung a tree branch with both hands and charged into the flames. The leaves burned away, and he used the branches to beat the fire; the branches broke, and he used his feet to stomp out the fire. Suddenly, a strong wind blew, and the fire surrounded him. "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." At this moment, Ning Fulin fearlessly and bravely used his body to roll into the fire, determined to pin the fire down under his body! The fire could burn Ning Fulin's skin and flesh, but it could not destroy the red heart of the hero who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and the people. At this critical moment, his comrades saw him stand up in the flames and shout from the depths of his heart: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then he rolled into the flames again.

Deputy Political Instructor Wang Youkang and more than a dozen soldiers fought in the most intense part of the fire. The heat scorched them, and the smoke choked them. Wang Youkang raised his voice and used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage everyone: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifices, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Under the command of Mao Zedong Thought, everyone bravely fought against the flames.

Suddenly, a strong wind blew, and flames surged from all directions, surrounding them. Under Wang Youkang's command, most of the comrades broke out of the fire, but only the "Old Yellow Cow" Wang Huangjin, who had repeatedly sworn to "live for the revolution and die for the revolution," was still fighting the fire in a deep ravine. "Our cadres must care for every soldier," Chairman Mao's good cadre Wang Youkang immediately rushed into the fire and charged towards Wang Huangjin's fighting position. At that moment, the soldiers saw through the roaring flames and thick smoke the glorious image of Wang Youkang sacrificing himself for the people: he held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao a thousand times!" When the comrades rushed to his side, Wang Youkang had stopped breathing. His left hand tightly held the revolutionary book, and his right hand pressed the whistle used to command the battle.

At the same time Wang Youkang rushed towards Wang Huangjin, the excellent soldier and Communist Party member Xu Tongyao also discovered that Wang Huangjin was surrounded by fire in the deep ravine. He hesitated not for a moment and jumped into the fire to rescue his comrade. After his sacrifice, he was still holding a charred tree root on the ravine wall with one hand and supporting his comrade Wang Huangjin with the other. He leaned against the ravine wall, standing tall, showing the unparalleled heroic spirit and deep affection for his class brothers of the people's soldiers.

"For the sake of sacrifice, many have great aspirations, daring to let the sun and moon shine anew." The four martyrs' infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, their revolutionary spirit of daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, inspired everyone to continue the fight. Many comrades in the Fourth Platoon were burned, but everyone fought harder and braver. Their heroic spirit inspired the tens of thousands of people who rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. After six hours of joint efforts by the military and the people, the fire that had spread over more than ten miles was finally extinguished, saving the surrounding vast forests and villages from disaster. A fierce battle to protect the people's interests and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was won!

Putting the people's interests as the first priority, caring for the broad masses more than oneself

The Fourth Platoon is a heroic platoon born in the flames of the anti-Japanese war. Over the years, the soldiers have always remembered Chairman Mao's repeated teachings: "They are not for the private interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation, that they unite and fight."

In the years of war, to liberate the people, the heroic Fourth Platoon fought north and south, from the Shandong Peninsula to the Liaodong Peninsula, from the banks of the Yalu River to the shores of the South China Sea, experiencing countless battles. In the Battle of Changling to defend Benxi in Northeast China, on the heroic battlefield of Taishan in the Liaoshen Campaign, in the days and nights of the Pingjin Campaign, and in the thousand-mile pursuit battle to liberate Guangxi, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon fought bravely, risking their lives for the people and creating indelible merits.

In the great struggle to defend socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Fourth Platoon further carried forward the glorious tradition of the army being both a fighting force and a work force and a production force. Wherever they went, they closely united with the local broad masses of the people. During the busy spring planting season, they helped the poor and lower-middle peasants plant rice seedlings in the fields; during the harvest season, they helped the poor and lower-middle peasants harvest rice; during droughts, they helped the masses fight against drought. They treated the people's difficulties as their own. The poor and lower-middle peasants lacked labor, and they provided labor; they lacked fertilizer, and they provided fertilizer; tools were insufficient, and they provided their own. The people praised the Fourth Platoon as "Model Platoon for Loving the People" and "People's Children," presenting them with one red banner after another. Every time the Fourth Platoon left a place, the poor and lower-middle peasants were reluctant to part and sent them off warmly.

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised the Fourth Platoon's love for the people to a new level. The soldiers, with their deep proletarian feelings of infinite love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Wherever they went, they spread Mao Zedong Thought, turning every place they passed through red. In the past two years, although they did not undertake the "Three Supports and Two Militarys" tasks, people called them the "Three Supports and Two Militarys" personnel who did not undertake the "Three Supports and Two Militarys" tasks.

Once, in a production brigade near the garrison, someone advocated selling less of the collective's vegetables to the state. As soon as they heard this news, they immediately felt that this was not a small matter but a reflection of the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and two roads in the countryside. They decided to help the poor and lower-middle peasants carry out revolutionary criticism and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line take deep root among the community members. The soldiers went to the production brigade and, together with the community members, picked wild vegetables, ate bitter meals, and recalled the bitterness and sweetness together. Class education was effective. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously demanded a meeting to settle accounts with the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. The revolutionary criticism continued for two days, and the community members' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between two lines increased significantly. They happily handed over the vegetables to the state and also greatly improved the quality of the vegetables handed over. With the help of the soldiers, all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade studied the "Three Articles," used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and further promoted the revolutionization of thought. In the past half year, this production brigade has been evaluated as an advanced unit for studying Chairman Mao's works by the brigade twice.

Another time, in a factory near the garrison, at a critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes and two roads, the class enemy jumped out, deceiving some of the masses, attacking the revolutionary masses, and disrupting the Cultural Revolution. The soldiers heard the news and rushed to the factory that night, vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, supporting the leftist masses, and engaging in a head-on struggle with the class enemy. In the face of the soldiers and revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the class enemy was completely defeated. The entire factory quickly achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution won one victory after another.

In the great waves of class struggle, the Fourth Platoon stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, always thinking of the broad revolutionary masses, and always acting in the interests of the broad revolutionary masses. They said: Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the broad revolutionary masses is the greatest love for the people; helping the broad revolutionary masses to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the greatest love for the people.

The abundant fruits of the Four Good Platoon movement, a combat collective loyal to Chairman Mao and the people

The Fourth Platoon was able to become a combat collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and the people, thanks to the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the abundant fruits of the Four Good Platoon movement.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and therefore an invincible army."

The Fourth Platoon has been evaluated as a Four Good Platoon for five consecutive years. In the Four Good Platoon movement, they armed the soldiers' minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, focused on the revolutionization of people's thinking, and cultivated revolutionary soldiers like the four martyrs Wang Youkang, Xu Tongyao, Ning Fulin, and Wang Huangjin, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and the people. In peacetime, they used such standards to demand of every soldier: "For Chairman Mao's instructions, study and implement them without deviation. For Chairman Mao's battle commands, respond promptly and advance fearlessly."

Before his death, Deputy Political Instructor Wang Youkang wrote in his diary: "Whether to use Chairman Mao's works or not is a question of whether one is a revolutionary or not; whether to use them in words or in actions is a question of whether one is a true revolutionary or a fake revolutionary; whether to use them generally or to use them thoroughly is a question of whether one is purely loyal to Chairman Mao or not." Wang Youkang was a representative figure who grew up in the Four Good Platoon movement. Over the years, he followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions and consistently strove to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, taking the establishment of the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly as the fundamental standard for transforming his worldview. He often said: "'Completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people means having no selfish thoughts in one's mind and dedicating everything to the people." He said what he did and did not deviate. Last year, the class struggle in the garrison was intense, and the army was tasked with protecting the revolutionary masses. When his wife came to visit the garrison, she was concerned about his safety. Wang Youkang then shared his insights from studying Chairman Mao's works with her, saying: "A revolutionary, when alive, should dedicate his life and energy to the cause of communism and become a useful person to the people. When the motherland and the people need me, I will step forward and contribute everything I have to defend Chairman Mao and the people." Another time, he was injured while working due to a risk, and his wife was very worried. Wang Youkang saw this and, on a Sunday, led his wife to the martyrs' tomb, where they studied Chairman Mao's great teachings together: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us, bravely. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their bloodstained path!" Fully expressing his noble qualities of having only Chairman Mao and the people in his heart.

Soldier Xu Tongyao was also a soldier who, in the revolutionary furnace of the Four Good Platoon, forged a heart that was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Before enlisting, he was a young intellectual who grew up in the city, had not suffered much, and lacked labor training. When he first enlisted, he could not adapt to the tense and hard military life of the platoon and wanted to go to the medical team to be a medic. At that time, the entire country and army, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Comrade Lei Feng," launched a magnificent campaign to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. In this learning high tide, the Party branch, based on the situation of the platoon, organized the "four ones" education: one long march, speaking of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of leading the revolution for decades; one glorious history, speaking of the platoon's revolutionary predecessors fighting bravely for the people under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, marching north and south, struggling hard, and fighting heroically; one account of blood and tears, organizing the platoon's soldiers who had suffered deeply in the old society to recall class bitterness and national hatred; one good example, vigorously publicizing Lei Feng's deep proletarian feelings, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and serving the people wholeheartedly. This series of educations ignited Xu Tongyao's deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He wrote in his diary: "I will read Chairman Mao's books every day, listen to Chairman Mao's words sentence by sentence, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life." From then on, Xu Tongyao diligently studied the "Three Articles," worked hard on his words, broke private thoughts more consciously, and raised his thought level of serving the people. He served five years and was a Five Good Soldier for five years. In this battle to extinguish the mountain fire, he had no "self" in his heart, sacrificing his young life for the people's interests and to rescue his comrade, fulfilling his iron oath made before his death: "To be a Five Good Soldier of Chairman Mao, a soldier of the people, and a 'public' soldier of communism."

Soldier Wang Huangjin, after being tempered in the furnace of the Four Good Platoon, grew into an "Old Yellow Cow" who worked hard. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution raised his proletarian awareness to a new level. In the fiery struggle, he studied diligently and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong's theory, line, policy, and principle of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to arm his mind, and striving to raise his awareness of class struggle and the struggle between two lines. During construction, after being injured and fainting, as soon as he woke up, he demanded to continue participating in the work, saying: "Construction is defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I will insist on fighting!" The comrades insisted on sending him down the mountain to rest. In the two days of recuperation, he gritted his teeth, endured the pain, overcame the difficulty of low cultural level, and lay on the bed to write a criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi that was more than four thousand words long.

The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rapidly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between two lines of the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, making the brilliant flower of the Four Good Platoon movement bear more abundant fruits. The Fourth Platoon, this excellent combat collective, is the brilliant fruit of the Four Good Platoon movement.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroic Fourth Platoon is currently studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and implementing the various great battle tasks proposed by the plenary session. They are determined to advance along the revolutionary course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, stride forward, and create new merits for the people in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　忠于毛主席的战士最热爱人民
　　——记人民解放军广州部队某部“爱民模范连”
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席最近亲自批准，由中央军委发布命令，授予“爱民模范连”光荣称号的人民解放军广州部队某部四连，是一个无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱人民的英雄集体。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大战斗中，四连全体指战员用自己的英勇行动，谱写了一曲响彻云霄的胜利凯歌。他们怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于人民的赤胆红心，同一场猛烈的山火进行了激烈的搏斗，用鲜血和生命保护了人民生命财产的安全，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。副指导员王幼康和战士许统耀、宁福连、王焕金，在这场战斗中光荣地献出了年轻的生命。
    四连同志以他们的英雄事迹，实践了自己的誓言：“对毛主席的指示，学到做到，决不两样。对毛主席的战斗号令，闻风而动，一往无前。”
    四连同志的英雄事迹，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级建军路线的伟大胜利，是落实林副主席关于政治建军的方针原则的结果。
    “有我们在，就不能让国家财产受到损失！”
    今年年初，粤北山区的广大军民，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号召下，斗志昂扬、意气风发地坚决落实伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的号召，迎接战斗的春天。
    一月十五日下午，四连指战员正在举行活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，突然，远处传来一阵呼喊：“火烧山啦！快救火呀！”指战员只见北边山丛中烧起熊熊烈火，北风卷着草木灰黑压压地横空扑来，附近的村庄和国家的大片松林受到了严重威胁。
    火光就是命令！四连的指战员们高声朗读毛主席的“全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨”的教导，坚决表示：“有我们在，就不能让国家财产受到损失！”他们立即出动，向火场飞奔。
    北风呼啸，烈焰腾空。在文化大革命中狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“活命哲学”的指战员们，在熊熊烈火面前，英勇无畏。他们迎着浓烟，冲进火海，哪里最危险，就往哪里闯；哪里火最猛，就往哪里冲。有的衣服烧着了，手上的皮烧脱了，全然不顾；有的头发烧着了，脸上燎起了水泡，半步也不后退。在打火的树枝上，沾着英雄战士们的皮肉和鲜血。他们豪迈地说：“大火能把树木烧焦，能把岩石烧碎，但吓不退用毛泽东思想武装起来的、全心全意为人民服务的英雄战士！”
    战士宁福连，他人小志大，经常说：“革命不怕死，怕死不革命！”干什么都冲在前头，大家称他是“小炮弹”。他患感冒已经三天，听说救火，他忘记了病，飞也似地直奔火场。连长不让他去，他说：“抢救人民财产要紧，我爬也要爬去！”他一到火场，便双手抡起树枝，向火浪扑去。树叶燎光了，他用枝条打；枝条打断了，他用脚踩火。突然一阵强风扑来，大火把他包围了。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”这时候，宁福连毫无畏惧，一往无前地用身躯向大火滚去，顽强地要把大火压倒在自己身下！大火能够烧坏宁福连的皮肉，却烧不毁英雄战士无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于人民的红心。在这生死关头，战友们看到他在烈焰中站起来，从肺腑中发出一声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”然后又向烈火滚去。
    副指导员王幼康和十几个战士，战斗在火势最猛烈的地段。火烤得他们疼痛难忍，烟呛得他们透不出气。王幼康提高了嗓音，用毛主席的教导鼓舞大家：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”在毛泽东思想的指挥下，大家迎着烈火英勇战斗。
    突然，一阵大风卷着火浪扑来，霎时间，四面八方火光冲天，把他们团团围住。在王幼康的指挥下，大多数同志冲出了火海，只有过去曾一再发誓要“生为革命生，死为革命死”的“老黄牛”王焕金还在一条深沟里和烈火搏斗。“我们的干部要关心每一个战士”，毛主席的好干部王幼康，立即冲进火海，向王焕金战斗的地方扑去。这时，战士们透过翻腾咆哮的烈火浓烟，看到王幼康为人民英勇献身的光辉形象：他，高高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，连连喊出了气壮山河的呼声：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”当同志们冲到他跟前的时候，王幼康已经停止了呼吸。他左手紧紧地握着革命宝书，右手压着指挥战斗的哨子。
    在王幼康奔向王焕金的同时，五好战士、共产党员许统耀也发现了王焕金被火围在深沟里。他毫不犹豫地跳入火海抢救战友。他牺牲后，还一手拉着沟壁上烧焦了的树根，一手托着战友王焕金。他依着沟壁，昂然挺立，显示了人民战士无比英雄的气概和对阶级兄弟无比深厚的感情。
      “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”四位烈士对毛主席、对人民的无限忠诚，他们刀山敢上、火海敢闯的革命英雄主义精神，激励着大家继续战斗。四连许多同志被烧伤了，但大家越战越强，越战越勇。他们英勇顽强的精神，鼓舞着陆续赶来灭火的成千上万的群众，经过军民共同奋战六小时，终于扑灭了这场蔓延十余里的山火，使周围广大山林和村庄免受灾害。一场保护人民利益、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的激烈战斗胜利了！
    把人民的利益作为第一生命，关心广大群众比关心自己为重
    四连，是一个诞生在抗日烽火中的英雄连队。长期以来，指战员们牢记着毛主席的谆谆教导：“他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。”
    在战火纷飞的年代里，为着解放人民，英雄四连南征北战，从胶东半岛到辽东半岛，从鸭绿江边到南海之滨，经历了数不清的战斗。在东北保卫本溪的长岭战斗中，在辽沈战役守备塔山的英雄阵地上，在平津战役的日日夜夜里，在解放广西的千里追击战中，四连指战员前赴后继，出生入死，为人民创建了不可磨灭的功勋。
    在保卫社会主义革命、社会主义建设的伟大斗争中，四连进一步发扬了我军既是一个战斗队，同时又是一个工作队、生产队的光荣传统。他们每到一地，就同当地的广大人民群众紧密结合起来。在春耕大忙季节，他们帮助贫下中农下田插秧；在丰收的日子，他们帮助贫下中农抢收稻谷；天旱缺水，他们帮助群众抗旱。他们把群众的困难当成自己的困难。贫下中农缺劳力，他们支援劳力；缺肥料，他们支援肥料；工具不够用，他们把自己的拿出来。群众称赞四连是“爱民模范”和“人民子弟兵”，赠送给他们一面又一面鲜红的锦旗。四连每离开一个地方，贫下中农都难分难舍，热情地送了一程又一程。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，把四连的爱民活动提高到一个新的阶段。指战员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，勇敢捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里，走一路红一线，住一处红一片。两年来他们虽然没有担负“三支”“两军”任务，但人们称他们是没有担负“三支”“两军”任务的“三支”“两军”人员。
    一次，驻地附近一个生产队里，有人主张把集体生产的蔬菜少卖些给国家。他们一听到这个消息，马上感到这不是小问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在农村的反映。他们决定帮助贫下中农开展革命大批判，让毛主席的革命路线在社员中深深扎根。指战员们来到生产队，便同社员一起采野菜，吃忆苦饭，共同忆苦思甜。阶级教育一抓就灵。贫下中农一致要求开大会清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在农村妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。革命大批判连续进行了两天，社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高，都愉快地把蔬菜交售给国家，而且还大大提高了蔬菜的交售质量。在战士们的帮助下，全队贫下中农大学“老三篇”，用毛泽东思想斗私批修，进一步促进了思想革命化。半年来，这个生产队两次被大队评为学习毛主席著作的先进单位。
    另一次，驻地附近一个工厂，在两个阶级、两条道路激烈搏斗的关键时刻，阶级敌人跳了出来，蒙蔽一部分群众，打击无产阶级革命派，破坏文化大革命。指战员们听到这个消息，连夜赶到工厂，大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，支持左派群众，同阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。在毛泽东思想武装起来的战士和革命群众面前，阶级敌人彻底失败了。全厂迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    四连在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，就是这样坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，时刻想着广大革命群众，处处为着广大革命群众。他们说：用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，是最大的爱民；帮助广大革命群众坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，是最大的爱民。
    四好连队运动的丰硕成果，忠于毛主席、忠于人民的战斗集体
    四连，所以能成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于人民的战斗集体，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，是创造四好连队运动的丰硕成果。
    林副主席指出：“中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，是全心全意为人民服务的队伍，因而是战无不胜的队伍。”
    四连，是连续五年被评为四好的连队。他们在四好连队运动中，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装指战员的头脑，狠抓人的思想革命化，培养了象王幼康、许统耀、宁福连、王焕金四烈士那样无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于人民的革命战士。平时，他们用这样的标准来要求每个战士：“对毛主席的指示，学到做到，决不两样。对毛主席的战斗号令，闻风而动，一往无前。”
    副指导员王幼康生前在日记中写道：“学习毛主席著作用还是不用，是革命不革命的问题；用在口头上还是用在行动上，是真革命还是假革命的问题；一般地用还是狠狠地用，是对毛主席忠的纯不纯的问题。”王幼康是在创造四好连队运动中成长起来的一个代表人物。几年来，他遵照林副主席的指示，一贯努力活学活用毛主席著作，把树立全心全意为人民服务的思想作为改造世界观的根本标准。他经常说：“‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务，就是脑子里没有一点私心杂念，把自己的一切献给人民。”他说到做到，决不两样。去年，驻地阶级斗争很激烈，部队担负着保护革命群众的光荣任务。他爱人来队探望时，担心他的安全。王幼康就对她讲自己学习毛主席著作的心得，他说：“一个革命者，活着就应该把毕生的精力和生命献给共产主义事业，做一个对人民有用的人。当祖国和人民需要我的时候，我就要挺身而出，为保卫毛主席、保卫人民贡献自己的一切。”又一次，他在施工中因为排险受了伤，他爱人很不安。王幼康看在眼里，就在一个星期天领着他爱人到烈士墓前，和她一起学习毛主席的伟大教导：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”充分表达了他心中只有毛主席，只有人民的高贵品质。
    战士许统耀，也是在四好连队这座革命熔炉里冶炼出一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心的。入伍前，他是个在城市里长大的知识青年，从小读书，没受过什么苦，也缺乏劳动锻炼。刚入伍时，他过不惯连队紧张艰苦的军事生活，想到卫生队去当卫生员。当时，全国全军遵照伟大领袖毛主席“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈的学习雷锋同志的活动。在这一学习高潮中，党支部根据连队的情况组织了“四个一”的教育：一条长征路，讲毛主席几十年来领导革命斗争的伟大革命实践；一部光荣史，讲连队革命前辈在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，南征北战，艰苦奋斗，为人民而英勇战斗的光荣传统；一笔血泪账，组织连队在旧社会苦大仇深的战士忆阶级苦和民族恨；一个好榜样，大力宣传雷锋怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，全心全意为人民服务的光辉事迹。这一系列教育，使许统耀焕发出对毛主席和毛泽东思想深厚的无产阶级感情。他在日记中写道：“毛主席的书我要天天读，毛主席的话我要句句听，一辈子跟毛主席干革命。”从此，许统耀勤奋地学习“老三篇”，在用字上狠下功夫，破私立公更自觉了，为人民服务的思想境界更高了。他五年服役五年红，年年都是五好战士。在这次扑灭山火的战斗中，他心中无“我”，为了人民利益，为了抢救战友，英勇地献出了年轻的生命，实现了他生前立下的“当毛主席的五好兵，人民的子弟兵，共产主义的‘公’字兵”的钢铁誓言。
    战士王焕金，经过四好连队熔炉的冶炼，成长为一个埋头苦干的“老黄牛”。无产阶级文化大革命，使他的无产阶级觉悟提高到了新的水平。他在火热的斗争中，刻苦学习、坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策武装自己的头脑，努力提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。施工时，他负伤昏过去后，一醒来就要求继续参加作业，他说：“施工就是捍卫无产阶级专政，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我要坚持战斗！”同志们硬是要他下山休息。他在两天养伤的时间里，咬着牙，忍着痛，克服文化水平低的困难，伏在铺上写出了长达四千多字的批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的文章。
    无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争实践，飞速地提高着人民解放军指战员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，使灿烂的四好连队运动之花，不断结出更加丰硕的成果。四连，这个过硬的英雄集体，就是四好连队运动的光辉成果。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    英雄的四连，目前正在学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务。他们决心沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命航向，阔步前进，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中为人民再立新功！
