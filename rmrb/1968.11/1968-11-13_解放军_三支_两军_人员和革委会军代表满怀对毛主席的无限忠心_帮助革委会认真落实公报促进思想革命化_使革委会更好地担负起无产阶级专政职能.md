PLA "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel and military representatives in revolutionary committees, filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, help revolutionary committees seriously implement the communiqué to promote ideological revolutionization and better shoulder the responsibilities of proletarian dictatorship.

According to Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: PLA personnel stationed on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" and military representatives participating in local revolutionary committees at various levels, filled with deep proletarian sentiments of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, actively help local revolutionary committee members to seriously study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and focus on revolutionizing the leading cadres. They are determined to continuously consolidate, develop, and perfect the newly established revolutionary committees, better shoulder the responsibilities of proletarian dictatorship, and in uniting and leading the broad revolutionary masses to implement the various combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, seriously carry out the great struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and play a powerful revolutionary role.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Since the day they heard the broadcast, PLA "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel and military representatives in the revolutionary committees have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and this passage from the communiqué: "Over the past two years, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The central issue of this struggle is the question of power, the question of whether the leadership is in the hands of Marxists or revisionists, the question of whether the leadership of the Party and the state is in the hands of Marxists or revisionists." They have also studied this in conjunction with the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, further deepening their understanding of the extremely profound significance of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have deeply realized that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. After establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, throughout the entire historical period of socialism, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is necessary to persist in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and to persist in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This has further heightened their awareness of helping revolutionary committee members to strengthen their own ideological revolutionization.

After the publication of the Party's Twelfth Plenum communiqué, they, with the greatest political enthusiasm, helped local revolutionary committees to universally establish study classes. The support-left personnel stationed in Lingbao County, in the study class, used the communiqué as a mirror to summarize and inspect the previous phase of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, find gaps, and formulate measures, determined to raise the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work to a new level in the new situation. The support-left liaison station of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region in Huailai County, on the day after the publication of the communiqué, dispatched a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team composed of 1,300 PLA soldiers, workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students to go deep into 24 communes' production brigades and production teams to propagate the communiqué and help members of revolutionary committees at various levels to seriously study it. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit stationed at the Shenyang Machine Tool Industry Company, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "the working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in struggle," when helping the company's revolutionary committee to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, also absorbed leading cadres and active elements from the affiliated factories and the masses to participate, using the communiqué as a weapon, focusing on their own ideological revolutionization, and better leading the masses to study and implement the communiqué.

The communiqué points out: "The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in struggle. This is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensuring that our country will never change color." Many "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel and military representatives in the revolutionary committees regard further studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of strengthening the revolutionization of the revolutionary committees. In the process of studying the communiqué with the revolutionary committee members, they introduced the advanced experience of the army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and strengthening their own revolutionization. They also helped them formulate measures for further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The support-left personnel of the PLA stationed in Huizhou County, Guangdong, helped the county revolutionary committee members to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, hold open-door rectification meetings, and, in accordance with the communiqué, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, establishing the idea of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, greatly raising the political consciousness of the revolutionary committee members.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." When studying the communiqué together with the support-left personnel, military representatives, and members of the revolutionary committees, they united in indignation, angrily denouncing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' treasonous crimes of betraying the Party and the country, and deeply criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of power. They pointed out unanimously that only by thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi and completely eliminating the poison he spread can the newly established revolutionary committees be continuously consolidated and developed, and the proletarian iron mountains and rivers remain unchanged. On the day the communiqué was published, Wang Zhonghui, deputy director of the revolutionary committee of the Wuhan Meat Processing Plant and military representative, convened a meeting that night to organize the revolutionary committee members to repeatedly study the communiqué and angrily denounce Liu Shaoqi. In September 1958, Liu Shaoqi, under the pretext of "inspection," went to the Nanjing Morning Machine Tool Factory and spread poison. The director of the factory's revolutionary committee, military representative Wu Zhikun, and other members of the revolutionary committee, using the communiqué as a weapon, fully mobilized the broad masses to further carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminating the poison Liu Shaoqi spread. The support-left personnel stationed at the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, in the Mao Zedong Thought study class held for all employees of the factory, helped the revolutionary committee to organize everyone to study the communiqué while criticizing Liu Shaoqi and exposing the enemy situation of the factory, making everyone further raise their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The entire factory, from the workshops to the teams, set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism, and the work of revolutionary criticism and cleansing of class ranks was carried out with great enthusiasm. The military representatives and other members of the revolutionary committee of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory, in the process of studying the communiqué, checked the phenomenon of "emphasizing cleansing and neglecting criticism" in the previous struggle against the enemy and formulated improvement measures. Now, they combine revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, making revolutionary criticism continuously develop in depth.

PLA personnel stationed on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" and members of revolutionary committees at various levels, in the process of studying the communiqué, reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching on "organizing a revolutionary leading cadre group that is connected with the masses," further recognizing the great significance of closely connecting with the masses for the construction of revolutionary power. While comparing with the communiqué and finding gaps, they took effective measures to further strengthen their connection with the masses. Many factory revolutionary committees' members actively went to the workers to solicit opinions, mobilized the masses, and relied on the masses to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. Many places' revolutionary committees also further improved the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. With the help of the support-left personnel, the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Factory held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the participation of old workers, focusing on the issue of power construction to deeply study the communiqué. The old workers, with a high sense of political responsibility, enthusiastically made suggestions to the revolutionary committee, helped the revolutionary committee find shortcomings, and improved work. The support-left personnel of Shibidi Commune, Qionghai County, Hainan Island, helped the commune revolutionary committee members to study the communiqué and formulated four measures to strengthen the connection with the masses: first, revolutionary committee members take turns to hold meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants in various production teams to listen to criticism and opinions; second, full-time committee members each take a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a hoe, and a pair of fertilizer baskets to the production front line to study, labor, and accumulate fertilizer with the masses; third, full-time committee members and all staff members, except for one person on duty, all move to live with the poor and lower-middle peasants, implementing the "five together" with the poor and lower-middle peasants; fourth, the poor and lower-middle peasants evaluate the revolutionary committee members living in their homes once a month. This way, the poor and lower-middle peasants are very satisfied. When the revolutionary committee of the Guangzhou Silk and Hemp Factory simplified the organization, it did not fully mobilize the masses and came up with a plan itself, resulting in many people and many organizations. Workers said it was still the "old way." After studying the communiqué, the support-left personnel helped the revolutionary committee to fully rely on the masses to formulate a reform plan, quickly achieving streamlining and efficiency, and receiving praise from the workers. Workers said that now this reform is what we welcome.

　　解放军“三支”“两军”人员和革委会军代表满怀对毛主席的无限忠心
　　帮助革委会认真落实公报促进思想革命化
　　使革委会更好地担负起无产阶级专政职能
    据新华社十二日讯　战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的人民解放军广大指战员和参加地方各级革命委员会的军队代表，满怀无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，积极帮助各地革委会成员，认真学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，狠抓领导班子革命化，决心使新生的革委会不断地巩固、发展和完善，更好地担负起无产阶级专政的职能，在团结带领广大革命群众贯彻执行全会提出的各项战斗任务，认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大斗争中，发挥出强大的革命作用。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”人民解放军“三支”“两军”人员和革委会中的军队代表，从听到广播的那天起，就反复学习毛主席这一最新指示和公报中的这样一段话：“两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的剧烈斗争。斗争的中心，是政权问题，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权问题，是党和国家的领导权掌握在马克思主义者或修正主义者手里的问题。”并且结合两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践来学，进一步加深了对毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命学说的极其深远意义的认识。他们深刻地认识到，革命的根本问题，是政权问题，在建立了无产阶级专政的政权以后，在整个社会主义历史时期，要巩固无产阶级专政，必须坚持两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，坚持在无产阶级专政下继续革命，从而进一步提高了帮助革委会成员加强自身思想革命化建设的自觉性。党的十二中全会公报发表以后，他们就以最大的政治热情，帮助当地革委会普遍办起了学习班。驻灵宝县的支左人员，在学习班上，以公报为镜子，总结检查前一段的“三支”“两军”工作，找差距，订措施，决心在新形势下把“三支”“两军”工作提高一步。北京部队某部驻怀来县支左联络站指战员，在公报发表的第二天，派出由解放军战士、工人、革命干部、革命师生一千三百多人组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到二十四个公社的生产大队、生产队去宣传公报，帮助各级革委会成员认真学习。驻沈阳市机床工业公司某部毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，在帮助公司革委会举办毛泽东思想学习班时，还吸收所属工厂的领导骨干和群众中的积极分子参加，以公报为武器，狠抓自身思想革命化，更好地带领群众学习和落实公报。
    公报指出：“广大工农兵群众在斗争中自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，这是巩固无产阶级专政、使我国永不变色的根本保证。”许多“三支”“两军”人员和革委会的军队代表，都把进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，作为加强革委会革命化建设的根本，在同革委会成员一起学习公报的过程中，向他们介绍了部队活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，加强自身革命化的先进经验，并且帮助他们制订了进一步学好用好毛主席著作的措施。驻广东惠阳县解放军支左人员，帮助县革委会成员学习毛主席关于革委会建设的指示，开门整风，对照公报斗私批修，树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，大大提高了革委会成员的政治觉悟。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”解放军支左人员、革委会的军队代表和革委会成员在一起学习公报时，同仇敌忾，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行，深入批判刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线。他们一致指出，只有把刘少奇批深批透，把他散布的毒素彻底肃清，新生的革委会才能不断巩固、发展，无产阶级的铁打江山才能永不变色。武汉肉类联合加工厂革委会副主任、军队代表王忠辉，在公报发表的当天，连夜召开会议，组织革委会成员反复学习公报，愤怒声讨刘少奇。一九五八年九月，刘少奇曾经以“视察”为名，到南京晨光机器厂大肆放毒。这个厂革委会主任、军队代表吴志坤和革委会其他成员一起，以公报为武器，充分发动广大群众，进一步开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇放的毒。驻哈尔滨电机厂支左人员，在厂革委会举办的全厂职工毛泽东思想学习班里，帮助革委会针对一些人的活思想，组织大家一边学习公报，一边狠批刘少奇，一边大摆本厂敌情，使大家进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。全厂从车间到班组处处摆开革命大批判的战场，革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，搞得热气腾腾。昆明机床厂革委会的军队代表和革委会其他成员在学习公报中，检查了前一段对敌斗争中有“重清理，轻批判”的现象，制定了改进的措施。现在，他们把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密结合起来，使革命大批判不断向纵深发展。
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的人民解放军广大指战员和各级革委会成员，在学习公报的过程中，重温毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的伟大教导，进一步认识到密切联系群众对于革命政权建设的伟大意义。他们一面对照公报，狠找差距，一面采取有效措施，进一步密切同群众的联系。不少工厂的革委会成员主动到工人群众中去征求意见，放手发动群众，充分依靠群众搞好本单位的斗、批、改。许多地方的革委会还进一步健全了干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。北京市摩托车制造厂革委会在解放军支左人员帮助下，举办了有老工人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，围绕政权建设问题，深入学习公报。老工人以高度的政治责任感，满腔热情地向革委会提建议，帮助革委会找缺点，改进工作。海南岛琼海县石璧公社支左人员帮助公社革委会成员，学习公报，制订了四项密切联系群众的措施：一、革委会成员轮流到各生产队召开贫下中农座谈会，听取批评意见；二、脱产委员每人带一套《毛泽东选集》，一把锄头，一对粪箕，到生产第一线和群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起积肥；三、脱产委员和全体工作人员，除留一人值班外，全部搬到贫下中农家住，与贫下中农实行“五同”；四、贫下中农每月对住在家中的革委会成员进行一次讲评。这样做，贫下中农非常满意。广州绢麻厂革委会在精简机构时，没有充分发动群众，自己搞了个方案，人多机构多，工人们说还是“老一套”。学习公报以后，支左人员帮助革委会充分依靠群众制订改革方案，很快实现了精兵简政，受到工人群众的赞扬。工人们说，现在这样改，才是我们欢迎的。
