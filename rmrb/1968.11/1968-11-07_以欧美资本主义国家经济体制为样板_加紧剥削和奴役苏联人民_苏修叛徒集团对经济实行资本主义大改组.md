The Soviet revisionist clique has, in recent times, intensified its implementation of the so-called "new economic system." They have extended the capitalist principles embodied in this "system" to every aspect of economic life, and using the economic system of Western capitalist countries as a model, they have carried out a comprehensive reorganization of the entire management system of the Soviet national economy, intensifying the exploitation and enslavement of the Soviet working people.

Since the beginning of 1966, the Soviet revisionist clique has formally begun to implement on a large scale in the Soviet Union the "new economic system" with the capitalist principle of profit as its core. To date, more than 13,000 industrial enterprises, 9,000 transportation, agricultural, and service industry enterprises, hundreds of thousands of commercial enterprises, and many construction enterprises have implemented this "system."

	Implementing the principle of profit in every aspect of enterprise operations
	The Soviet revisionist clique has decided that in the so-called "new phase of economic reform," the primary task is to implement the main principles of the "new system"—"profit first" and "material incentives"—in every aspect of each enterprise, from workshops and teams to individuals.

	They not only propose to "transfer the indicators of product sales and profits to all production workshops," but also to implement "economic accounting" in auxiliary workshops, and even in some production sections and teams, as well as in various departments of the enterprise. At the same time, they significantly expand the powers of workshop directors, allowing them to establish their own reward funds based on the profits of their workshops and to formulate their own reward regulations.

	Even more absurdly, they advocate for "economic accounting for teams and individuals," aiming to make every worker "clearly understand how their more effective labor can be rewarded, not only in the form of wages, but also in the form of special payments from the material incentive fund." In other words, they attempt to use rubles as bait to drive the vast majority of Soviet workers to create more profits for the new capitalists of the Soviet Union.

	To increase the interest of enterprise leaders in formulating "tight" plans and chasing after excess profits, the Soviet revisionist clique has decided to change the numerous reward systems and various "economic incentive fund" allocation methods previously applied to enterprises into a single method of allocating a "stable" share from profits; changing the original profit-based allocation to actual profit-based allocation. This means that enterprise leaders, regardless of the methods they use to obtain profits, will be guaranteed a certain proportion of profit sharing. Enterprise leaders, stimulated by such "material incentives," will naturally exploit and oppress the working class in the most brutal manner. At the same time, to enable enterprises to earn more profits, the Soviet revisionist clique openly advocates for the widespread implementation of the "experience" of significantly reducing the number of workers and increasing the labor intensity of employed workers to increase enterprise profits across the Soviet Union.

	Establishing an economic management system according to the blueprint of monopoly capitalism
	At the same time, the Soviet revisionist clique is vigorously promoting the establishment of large-scale "combined enterprises" at the regional and departmental levels, using this as the first step in this major reorganization. These new-style capitalists, who hide behind the banner of "socialism," shamelessly advocate for the use of the "organizational charts" of American monopolies in formulating plans to establish such "combined enterprises."

	The Soviet revisionist clique's establishment of so-called "combined enterprises" in the Soviet Union according to the model of Western monopolies is certainly not accidental. At present, in the Soviet Union, profit is the main standard for evaluating an enterprise's "contribution" and the decisive factor in the survival and development of an enterprise. If profits are high, the enterprise can develop rapidly; if profits are low or the enterprise operates at a loss, it faces the danger of being eliminated. In the fierce competition for profits, the capitalist law of the survival of the fittest comes into play. This inevitably leads to the phenomenon of large enterprises absorbing smaller ones, characteristic of capitalist free competition.

	According to reports in Soviet revisionist publications, such "combined enterprises" generally include all enterprises in a department located in a province, republic, or large economic region. Subsequently, the scale of the combined enterprises can be expanded to cover the entire Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist clique is currently preparing to implement "economic accounting" for the management agencies of various industrial departments and enterprises—the industrial directorates of various departments. According to Soviet revisionist publications, "the directorate implementing full economic accounting means nothing other than transforming the directorate into a departmental combined enterprise." This means that the full-scale "combined enterprises" to be established will actually take over the functions of the current industrial directorates, and the various industrial departments of the Soviet Union will control enterprises through them.

	In the situation where all subordinate management directorates implement "economic accounting" and gradually transform into "departmental combined enterprises," the nature and role of the various industrial departments of the Soviet Union as state management agencies also undergo further changes. In this way, an economic management system organized according to the blueprint of Western monopoly capitalism—the department-combined enterprise-enterprise three-tier system—will form a new state monopoly capitalist management system in the Soviet Union.

	Intensifying the extraction of profits, freely buying and selling means of production
	In this major reorganization, the Soviet revisionists are also preparing to further change the relationship between the state and enterprises, transforming it into a naked profit-sharing relationship. They propose to establish a "new form of financial relations between enterprises and the state." According to this "new form," the Soviet-controlled state will increasingly not interfere with the production of enterprises, but will only provide funds or loans to various levels of monopoly capitalist groups and their subordinate enterprises. Various levels of monopoly organizations and enterprises will share a portion of the profits with the state in the form of "fund payments" or interest. In this way, the Soviet-controlled state is completely transformed into a capitalist big boss, entrusting enterprises with a sum of money and allowing them to make profits, with the state taking a share of the profits. Enterprises become "joint ventures" jointly operated and profit-sharing by the state and the heads of various levels of monopoly capitalist groups.

	In their "new phase of economic reform," the Soviet revisionist clique has decided to vigorously promote the system of free buying and selling of means of production, using this as one of the fundamental measures to reorganize the Soviet national economy and completely restore capitalism. According to reports in Soviet publications, the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply of the Soviet revisionists has already opened 300 wholesale stores in various major cities of the Soviet Union, specializing in the free sale of certain equipment, instruments, and materials. In addition, some petroleum products, chemical products, and building materials, as well as "general means of production," are also being tried out in the free buying and selling system. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is further expanding this free buying and selling system, deciding to widely establish wholesale stores for the sale of means of production across the country, increasing the number of such stores to 500 by the end of this year and doubling it to 1,000 by the end of next year; the types of means of production freely sold through these stores will also continue to expand.

	The Soviet people will further recognize the true face of the revisionist clique
	The implementation of this so-called "new economic system" has greatly strengthened the bourgeois dictatorship of a small privileged stratum represented by the Soviet revisionist clique over the broad masses of working people, making the gap between the rich and the poor increasingly wide and class differentiation increasingly serious.

	Under the principle of profit above all, phenomena such as harming others for personal gain, seeking profit at all costs, free competition, and anarchic production in the Soviet national economy have become even more rampant, making the problems of poor product and construction quality, and shortages and out-of-stock situations of many necessary products for the national economy and people's lives, which had already appeared in the Khrushchev era, even more serious. The proportional relationships between various departments of the national economy and within each department have been further severely disrupted.

	From the day they began to implement the "new economic system," the Soviet revisionist clique has used every means to cover up the capitalist restoration nature of this so-called "economic reform." However, this small group of political swindlers cannot escape the various consequences of capitalist restoration that they have caused in the Soviet Union over the years of implementing the "new system." Now, they are about to further develop their "new system" in all aspects. Their retrograde actions will make the Soviet people and people around the world further recognize the true face of this group of die-hard traitors in the Kremlin.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious." The broad masses of the Soviet people, who have personally suffered from the bitterness of capitalist restoration, will certainly rise up to smash the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, restore the dictatorship of the proletariat, and bring the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track.

    以欧美资本主义国家经济体制为样板　加紧剥削和奴役苏联人民
    苏修叛徒集团对经济实行资本主义大改组
    据新华社讯　苏修叛徒集团最近一个时期，变本加厉地推行所谓“经济新体制”。他们把这一“体制”体现的资本主义原则进一步推广到经济生活一切环节中去，并且以欧美资本主义国家的经济体制为样板，对苏联国民经济整个管理体制进行一次从上到下的更大的改组，加紧剥削和奴役苏联劳动人民。
    苏修叛徒集团从一九六六年年初起，开始正式在苏联大规模推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“经济新体制”。到目前为止，已经有一万三千家工业企业、九千个运输、农业和服务行业的企业、几十万个商业企业和许多建筑企业实行了这种“体制”。
    把利润原则推行到企业内部的一切环节
    苏修叛徒集团决定，在从现在开始的所谓“经济改革的新阶段”中，首先要在各个企业内把“新体制”的主要原则“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”推行到企业的每一个环节，从车间、班组直到个人。
    他们不仅提出，要“把产品销售和利润这些指标转到所有生产车间”，而且还要把辅助车间，甚至有些工段和生产队以及企业各科室，都改行“经济核算”。同时大大扩大车间主任的权力，让他们根据本车间的利润提成，建立自己的奖励基金，自行制订本车间的奖励条例。
    尤其荒谬的是，他们还要推行什么“班组和个人经济核算”，要做到使每一个工人“清楚地认识到，他的更有效的劳动，怎样和在什么范围内，才能得到不仅以工资的形式，而且以物质鼓励基金的特别偿付的形式提供的奖励”。也就是说，妄图用卢布作诱饵，驱使苏联广大职工为苏联的新资本家创造更大量的利润。
    苏修叛徒集团为了提高企业负责人制定“紧张的”计划、追逐超额利润的兴趣，还决定把过去对企业施行的名目繁多的奖励制度和各种“经济刺激基金”提成办法，改成单一的按“稳定的”份额从利润中提成的办法；把原来的按计划利润提成，改为按实得利润提成。这就是说，企业领导人不管用什么办法把利润弄到手，那他就有把握地得到一定比例的利润分肥。受到这样“物质刺激”的企业负责人，当然就会象贪婪的吸血鬼一样，对工人阶级进行最残酷的剥削和压榨。同时，为了使企业能够赚到更多的利润，苏修叛徒集团还公开号召在全苏联企业中推广通过大量裁减工人、加强在职工人劳动强度来增加企业利润的“经验”。
    按照垄断资本主义的蓝图建立经济管理体制
    与此同时，苏修叛徒集团还拚命鼓吹建立地区性的和部门性的大规模“联合企业”，把这作为这次大改组的第一步。这些打着“社会主义”招牌的新式资本家，恬不知耻地宣扬，在制定建立这种“联合企业”的方案时，“应利用”美国垄断资本的什么“组织系统图”。
    苏修叛徒集团，按照西方垄断组织的样板，在苏联建立所谓“联合企业”，这决不是偶然的。在目前的苏联，利润是评价企业“贡献”的主要标准，是主宰企业发展存亡的决定因素。利润大，企业就可大发展；利润小，或者亏本，那就有被淘汰的危险。在剧烈的利润争夺中，强者生存、弱者灭亡的资本主义自由竞争规律在这里发生作用。这必然导致资本主义国有的企业间大鱼吃小鱼的兼并现象的出现。
    据苏修报刊报道，这种“联合企业”一般说应包括某一部门设在州里甚至共和国里或大经济区里的所有企业。随后，可以把联合企业的规模扩大到全苏联范围。苏修叛徒集团目前正准备对苏联各工业部同企业之间的管理机构——各部门的工业总局实行“经济核算”。按照苏修报刊的说法，“总局改行完全经济核算意味着不是别的，而是把总局变成部门性的联合企业”。这就是说，将要建立的全苏性的“联合企业”，实际上就将取代现在各工业总局的职能，苏联各工业部就将通过它们实行对企业的控制。
    在部属各管理总局都实行“经济核算”，逐步变成“部门性的联合企业”的情况下，苏修作为国家管理机关的各个工业部的性质和作用也进一步发生变化。这一来，按照西方垄断资本主义蓝图组织起来的部——联合企业——企业三级经济体制，将在苏联形成一种新的国家垄断资本主义管理体制。
    加紧榨取利润，自由买卖生产资料
    在这次大改组中，苏修还准备进一步改变国家同企业的关系，把它蜕变为一种赤裸裸的利润分配关系。他们提出要建立一种“企业同国家财务关系的新形式”。按照这种“新形式”，苏修控制的国家将越来越不过问企业的生产情况，而只以拨款或贷款的形式把钱交给各级垄断资本集团及其下属企业。各级垄断组织和企业则以“基金付费”或利息的形式分一部分利润给国家。这样，苏修控制的国家等于完全蜕变成为资本主义大老板，包给企业一笔钱，放手让企业赚钱，国家按本取利。企业就成了国家和各级垄断资本集团的头头合伙经营、共同分肥的“合营公司”。
    苏修叛徒集团在他们的“经济改革新阶段”中，还决定大踏步推行生产资料自由买卖的制度，把这作为改组苏联国民经济、彻底复辟资本主义的根本措施之一。据苏联报刊报道，目前，苏修国家物资技术供应委员会已经在苏联各大城市开设了三百家批发商店，专门自由出售某些设备、仪器和材料等。此外，部分石油产品、化学产品和建筑材料等“通用生产资料”也在试行自由买卖制度。现在，苏修叛徒集团又把这种自由买卖制度再大大发展一步，决定广泛在全国设立出售生产资料的批发商店，今年年底将把这种商店增加到五百家，明年年底还将再增一倍，使之达到一千家；通过这些商店自由出售的生产资料的种类也要不断扩大。
    苏联人民将进一步认清苏修集团的叛徒真面目
    这种所谓“经济新体制”的推行，大大加强了以苏修叛徒集团为代表的一小撮特权阶层对广大劳动人民的资产阶级专政，使贫富日益悬殊、阶级分化日益严重。
    在利润至上的经营原则刺激下，苏联国民经济各部门中，损人利己、唯利是图、自由竞争、生产的无政府状态等资本主义现象更加严重地泛滥起来，使赫鲁晓夫时代已经出现的产品质量和建筑质量低劣，国民经济和人民生活必需的不少产品供应紧张和脱销问题，变得更加严重。国民经济各部门和各部门内部的比例关系，遭到更加严重的破坏。
    苏修叛徒集团从推行“经济新体制”的第一天起，就千方百计掩盖这一所谓“经济改革”的复辟资本主义的实质。但是，这一小撮政治骗子是无法逃避他们推行“新体制”几年来为苏联造成的种种复辟资本主义的后果的。现在，他们又要把自己的“新体制”从各方面再向前发展。他们的这些倒行逆施，将使苏联人民和全世界人民进一步认清克里姆林宫中这一帮死心塌地的叛徒的真面目。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”亲身遭受资本主义复辟之苦的广大苏联人民，必将奋起摧毁苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政，使苏联重新回到社会主义轨道。
