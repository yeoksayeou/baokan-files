My family is an old poor peasant family. For three generations, we never had the chance to go to school and suffered greatly from illiteracy. After liberation, we were liberated, and we thought that now it was the turn for the children of the poor to go to school and study. We wanted my younger brother, Qing Shan, to go to school to make us poor people proud and to carry on the cause of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao said: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." Chairman Mao's words are exactly what we poor and lower-middle peasants think. When Qing Shan returned from school, we let him work, always feeling that the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants should not just study but also work. Otherwise, they would lose the spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The elders often say: "We can't let him just sit around. If he sits around, he'll develop bad habits. In the past, the landlords and rich peasants didn't carry burdens or hold baskets, relying on exploitation to live a parasitic life. We farmers can't follow their example. Our children should both love to study and love to work, becoming all-rounders." Qing Shan is a good boy and listens to us. He studies and works at the same time. When he comes home, he picks up the broom, then the rake, and never rests. The poor and lower-middle peasants all praise Qing Shan as a good boy.

However, the school emphasized "scores." They tested scores every year, every month, and even every day. This focus on scores really harmed our children from poor and lower-middle peasant families. Qing Shan participated in more labor at home, and sometimes when the work was busy, he would miss half a day of studying. Naturally, he got fewer scores in school. The school said Qing Shan was "stupid" and used scores to hold him back, making him repeat a grade four times. He spent seven or eight years in primary school. When it was almost time for the final exam, they said Qing Shan affected the "pass rate," and he didn't graduate from primary school, so he was sent back home. Why didn't the school open its doors to us poor and lower-middle peasants? I thought about it and couldn't figure it out.

This time, Chairman Mao launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we finally found the root of the problem in the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. It was he who caused all this trouble and did all the evil. At that time, the school was controlled by bourgeois intellectuals. They advocated "ignoring worldly affairs and focusing on studying the classics," promoting "intellectual education first" and "scores as the criterion." Our children are not stupid; it's because we poor and lower-middle peasants don't want Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line of "three separations." We want Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Therefore, we were excluded from the school controlled by bourgeois intellectuals. We and they are on two different paths.

Later, Qing Shan joined the army and gave those people a resounding slap in the face with facts. Qing Shan has a heart loyal to Chairman Mao. In the army, he made rapid progress and was continuously awarded the title of "Five Good Soldier" for four years from 1964 to now. His letters are better than those of some junior high school graduates. He also often tells us revolutionary truths, urging us to be eternally loyal to Chairman Mao and to always follow the Party in revolution. So, I really hate the old schools, and I love the PLA, which is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. My neighbor, poor peasant Guo Gai Zhi's second daughter, Wang Cun Shu, was also expelled from school because she often worked at home and got fewer scores. Now this girl has become a study group leader for Chairman Mao's works in the production team, capable in both literature and martial arts, and praised by everyone.

In the past, why were the students of poor and lower-middle peasants bullied and suppressed in school, blocked and closed out? It was because bourgeois intellectuals controlled the school and held the cultural power. Now, Chairman Mao instructs that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." This truly speaks for us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the greatest encouragement, the greatest care, the greatest trust, and the greatest motivation for us. With Chairman Mao's support and Mao Zedong Thought guiding us, we will seize the cultural power from the bourgeois intellectuals, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and turn the school into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will cultivate good successors for us poor and lower-middle peasants and cultivate red successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    彻底批判刘少奇“分数挂帅”的反动实质
    河北广宗县件只大队老贫农　刘清石
    我家是老贫农，三辈子都没念过书，受尽了没文化的苦。解放后翻了身，心想，以前都是那些地富子女进学堂，这回咱穷人的孩子该上学念书了。家里就想让我弟弟清山上学，好为咱穷人争气，接咱贫下中农的班。毛主席说：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”毛主席说的，正是咱贫下中农想的，清山从学校回到家来，家里就让他干活，总觉着贫下中农的子弟，不会干活，那是失掉了贫下中农的本色。老人常说：“不能让他光闲着，光闲着会闲出毛病来。过去地主老财肩不担担，手不提篮，靠剥削过日子，过寄生虫的生活。咱庄稼人可不能学他们的样儿，咱们供养的后生得又爱学习，又爱劳动，文武全才。”清山这孩子也很听话，一面上学，一面干活，回到家来，撂下扫帚，就是耙子，一会也不闲，贫下中农都夸清山是个好孩子。
    可是，学校里兴什么“分”，年年考分，月月考分，天天考分，这一考分，可把俺贫下中农的孩子给坑了。俺清山在家参加劳动多，有时活紧了，也短不了耽误一半晌，背条文抠书本的时间少，自然在学校得的分就少。学校就说俺清山“脑子笨”，用分来卡，让清山退了四次班，光初小就上了七、八年。快到考高小的时候，又说俺清山影响什么“升学率”，初小差一季没毕业，就给撵回来了。为什么学校的大门不为咱贫下中农开？我想过来，想过去，怎么也捉摸不透。
    这次毛主席发动了无产阶级文化大革命，我们才找到这个坏根在大叛徒刘少奇身上，是他搞的鬼，做的恶。那时，学校被资产阶级知识分子统治着，他们鼓吹什么“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，搞“智育第一”“分数挂帅”。我们的孩子决不是什么笨，是因为我们贫下中农不要刘少奇的“三脱离”的修正主义教育路线，要的是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，所以就被资产阶级知识分子统治的学校排挤在校门外边。我们和他们走的是两条路。
    后来，俺清山参了军，用事实给了那些人一个响亮的嘴巴。俺清山有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，在部队里进步很快，从一九六四年入伍到现在连续四年被评为“五好”战士。他写的信比有的初中毕业生写的还强呢。他还不断给我们讲些革命的道理，叫我们无限忠于毛主席，永远跟党干革命。所以过去的旧学校我算恨透了，从心眼里喜欢解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校。俺街坊贫农郭改芝的二闺女王存淑，因为在家里经常劳动，在学校考的分少了，也被撵出了校门。现在这个孩子成了生产队的学习毛主席著作辅导员，能文能武，人人称赞。
    以前，为什么贫下中农的学生在学校受排挤，受打击，左一卡，右一关，把贫下中农的子女关在校外边？就是因为资产阶级知识分子统治着学校，掌握着文权。现在，毛主席指示“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”真是说出了俺贫下中农的心里话。这是对俺贫下中农最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，最大的信任，最大的鞭策，有毛主席他老人家给我们撑腰，有毛泽东思想给我们照路，我们要把文权从资产阶级知识分子手里夺过来，彻底批判刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线，认真搞好斗、批、改，把学校办成毛泽东思想的大学校，培养我们贫下中农的好后代，培养无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。
