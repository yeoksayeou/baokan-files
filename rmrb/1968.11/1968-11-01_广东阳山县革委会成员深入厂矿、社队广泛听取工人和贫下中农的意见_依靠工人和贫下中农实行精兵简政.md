Members of the Yangshan County Revolutionary Committee in Guangdong Province have gone deep into factories, mines, and communes to widely solicit the opinions of workers and poor peasants. They rely on workers and poor peasants to implement streamlining and efficiency.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 31st: The Yangshan County Revolutionary Committee in Guangdong Province has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the construction of political power, it has fully played the role of the main force of the worker masses and poor peasants, achieving strict, thorough, and universal streamlining and efficiency from the county to the commune and production brigade. This has brought about extremely profound changes in the leadership organs at all levels in the county: organizational structures have been greatly streamlined, the spirit of cadres has been renewed, and significant progress has been made towards establishing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely connected with the masses.

Currently, the county revolutionary committee has four groups (Administrative Group, Political Work Group, Security Group, Production Group) and eight stations (Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Station, Financial and Tax Management Station, Production and Living Services Station, Grain and Oil Procurement Services Station, Rural Socialist Construction Services Station, Industrial and Mining Production Services Station, Transportation and Postal Services Station, and People's Health Services Station). These have replaced the ninety-four departments, bureaus, offices, and sections of the former county committee and county people's committee and their direct subordinate organs. Administrative staff have been reduced from 1,126 to 248 (including 30 staff members from the four groups of the county revolutionary committee). The 554 cadres originally in the 19 communes in the county have been reduced to 173. The cadres in the 204 production brigades in the county have also been reduced by more than 50%. The cadres who have been streamlined at the county and commune levels have, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going down to labor and the experience of the Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School, happily taken the path of integrating with workers and peasants, going to forest farms, tea plantations, nurseries, and production teams to participate in labor and receive re-education from the worker and peasant masses. Cadres in office have, through studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, increased their revolutionary enthusiasm, become more closely connected with the masses, and established a new revolutionary style.

After the establishment of the Yangshan Revolutionary Committee, four reforms were carried out on the bloated and complex administrative structures, but due to the influence of the old ideas and habits of the exploiting classes, the reforms were not thorough. Why did this situation arise? The leading members of the county revolutionary committee organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's discussions on the construction of political power and seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of the previous work. Through study, everyone deeply felt that streamlining and efficiency is a sharp and profound class struggle, a great struggle of breaking down and establishing new ideas and organizations. Great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class." Chairman Mao also says: "Without poor peasants, there is no revolution." They seriously studied these important instructions from Chairman Mao and realized that to genuinely implement streamlining and efficiency, one must firmly rely on the revolutionary main force, the working class, and poor peasants. Therefore, they went deep into factories, mines, and communes to widely solicit the opinions of workers and poor peasants and investigated and summarized the experiences of some factories and communes that had done well in streamlining and efficiency. They decided to widely mobilize the worker masses and poor peasants to participate in the streamlining and efficiency work of the leading organs and resolutely carry this revolution to the end.

The revolutionary committee immediately held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with streamlining and efficiency as the main content from the county to the commune and production brigade. At the same time, various forms of meetings were convened to widely mobilize workers and poor peasants to thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the construction of political power, and participate in the streamlining and efficiency work of the leading organs at all levels. The extensive exposure and criticism by the broad masses of workers and peasants greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the cadres in these units. Under the unified leadership of the county revolutionary committee, these units completed the streamlining and efficiency work in just a few days.

The Yangshan County Revolutionary Committee not only relied on workers and poor peasants in the process of dismantling old organizations but also fully played the role of the main force of workers and peasants in establishing new organizations. At the expanded meeting of the county revolutionary committee to study streamlining and efficiency work, worker and poor peasant representatives, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, put forward the "three ones" requirement for setting up new organizations according to Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining and efficiency": one starting point, which is to act in the interests of the people and follow Chairman Mao's instructions on "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to connect with the masses"; one principle, which is to ensure that proletarian politics is prominent and that the instructions and battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin can be smoothly transmitted and resolutely implemented; one standard, which is the five items proposed by Chairman Mao: "must achieve simplification, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism."

When discussing the plan to establish the Industrial and Mining Production Services Station, many cadres were still stuck on business matters, wanting to divide forces and retain more people, and the debate went on endlessly. After the worker masses participated in the discussion, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," they proposed that the station should first establish a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Group and then, based on the requirement to grasp ideological revolutionization, consider the establishment of other organizations and personnel allocations. Finally, it was decided that twenty-four people were enough for the entire station, accounting for only 32.4% of the original personnel in this aspect. When the Xinniu Commune discussed the plan, some commune cadres had the idea that more people would make things easier, calculating that at least eighteen people were needed. However, the poor peasants knew the commune's work situation best, understood the commune cadres' situation best, and knew best how many people were needed to complete the tasks. They considered the overall situation and the requirements of the commune's organs' revolutionization and cadres' ideological revolutionization, proposing that, in addition to the four standing committee members of the commune revolutionary committee, only four administrative personnel were needed (excluding the militia department and police), and they even thought about who would do what work. This gave the commune cadres a profound education, and everyone happily accepted this plan. The cadres in other communes in the county generally reduced from over thirty people to eight or nine, and the cadres in various production brigades generally reduced from over ten people to four or five.

After implementing streamlining and efficiency from top to bottom, the leading organs at all levels in Yangshan County seriously follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the front lines of revolution and production, and solve many problems at the grassroots level. Therefore, in the situation of fewer people and more tasks, work efficiency has improved, things are done better, and the masses are very satisfied.

    广东阳山县革委会成员深入厂矿、社队广泛听取工人和贫下中农的意见
    依靠工人和贫下中农实行精兵简政
    据新华社广州三十一日电　广东省阳山县革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在政权建设中充分发挥工人群众和贫下中农的主力军作用，从县到公社、大队实现了严格的、彻底的、普遍的精兵简政，使全县各级领导机关发生了极其深刻的变化：组织机构大大紧缩，干部的精神面貌焕然一新，向建立起一个革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子前进了一大步。
    现在，县革委会设有四个组（办事组、政工组、保卫组、生产组）及其所属的八个站（毛泽东思想宣传站、财税金融管理站、生产生活服务站、粮油购销服务站、农村社会主义建设服务站、工矿生产服务站、交通邮电服务站、人民卫生服务站），代替了旧县委、县人委及其直属机关九十四个部、科、局、室；行政业务人员从一千一百二十六人精简到二百四十八人（其中包括县革委会四大组工作人员三十人）；全县十九个公社原有干部五百五十四人，精简为一百七十三人；全县二百零四个大队的干部也减少了百分之五十以上。县和公社已精简的干部，学习了毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示和柳河“五·七”干校的经验以后，愉快地走上与工农相结合的道路，到林场、茶场、苗圃和生产队去参加劳动，接受工农群众的再教育。在职干部通过活学活用毛泽东思想，革命干劲倍增，与群众的联系更加密切，树立了崭新的革命作风。
    阳山革委会成立以后，对臃肿庞杂的行政机构曾经先后进行过四次改革，但是，由于剥削阶级的旧思想和习惯势力的影响，改革很不彻底。为什么会出现这种情况？县革委会领导成员组织大家带着这个问题反复学习毛主席关于政权建设的论述，认真总结前段工作的经验教训。经过学习，大家深深体会到，精兵简政是一场尖锐的深刻的阶级斗争，是一场大破大立的思想革命和组织革命。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。”毛主席又说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”他们认真学习了毛主席的这些重要指示，认识到要认真实行精兵简政，就必须紧紧依靠革命的主力军工人阶级和贫下中农。于是，他们深入厂矿和社队，广泛听取工人和贫下中农的意见，并且调查和总结了一些精兵简政工作搞得好的厂矿和社队的经验，决心广泛发动工人群众和贫下中农参加领导机关的精兵简政工作，坚决把这场革命进行到底。
    县革委会立即从县到公社、大队大办以精兵简政为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班，同时召开各种形式的会议，广泛发动工人和贫下中农彻底揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，参加各级领导机关的精兵简政工作。广大工农群众的揭发和批判，大大提高了这些单位干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。在县革委会的统一领导下，这些单位只用几天时间便顺利地完成了精兵简政工作。
    阳山县革委会不但在大破旧机构过程中紧紧依靠工人和贫下中农，而且在建立新机构时，也充分发挥工农群众主力军的作用。县革委会召开的研究精兵简政工作的扩大会议上，工人和贫下中农的代表怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，按照毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，对设置新机构提出了“三个一”的要求，即：一个出发点，就是一切从人民的利益出发，遵照毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的指示办事；一个原则，就是必须保证突出无产阶级政治，保证毛主席的指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令能够畅通无阻地传达下去，坚决地得到贯彻落实；一个标准，就是毛主席提出的“必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。”在开始讨论设立工矿生产服务站的方案的时候，许多机关干部仍是围绕着业务兜圈子，总想分兵把口，多留一些人，争论不休。工人群众参加讨论后，根据毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，提出站内首先要成立毛泽东思想宣传组，然后根据抓思想革命化的要求，考虑其他机构的设置和人员编制，最后确定全站二十四个人就够了，只占原来这方面机构人员的百分之三十二点四。新圩公社在讨论方案时，有的公社干部抱着人多好办事的想法，算来算去认为至少要留十八人才够。但是，贫下中农对公社工作情况最了解，对公社干部状况最清楚，对需要留多少人才能完成任务心中最有数，他们从全局出发，从有利于公社机关革命化和干部思想革命化的要求出发，提出除公社革委会的四名常委外，只需要留办事人员四人（不包括武装部和公安员），而且连谁担任什么工作也想好了，使公社干部受到一次深刻的教育，大家愉快地接受了这个方案。全县其他公社的干部一般也从三十多人减为八、九人，各生产大队的干部一般从十多人减为四、五人。
    阳山县从上到下实行精兵简政后，各级领导机构认真按照毛主席的指示办事，深入基层，深入革命和生产第一线，把许多问题解决在基层，因此，在人少事多的情况下，工作效能提高，事情办得更好，群众非常满意。
