On a certain military farm in the Tibetan plateau, a spirited young woman is driving a horse-drawn carriage, singing joyfully: "The rivers and mountains are as beautiful as a painting, the country's construction is galloping ahead. Being a military farm soldier is so glorious, carrying a shovel to plant crops..." This young woman is a beloved support-the-border intellectual youth, Deputy Platoon Leader Cheng Zhenying of a certain military farm.

	Following Chairman Mao's Words to the Border

	In 1966, after graduating from high school, Cheng Zhenying heard the news that the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region was recruiting support-the-border intellectual youth in Henan Province. She thought, the revolutionary forebears fought for the proletariat to seize power, and we, the younger generation, must defend and build on this power. I should follow Chairman Mao's words, go to where the country needs us most—the border—to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, undergo tempering through hard struggle, and forge myself into a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, contributing my strength to defending and building the proletarian's power. She persuaded her family and friends and resolutely joined the ranks of support-the-border youth, becoming a military farm soldier.

	In November 1966, Cheng Zhenying, filled with enthusiasm for building the border, arrived at her post—the certain military farm in the Tibetan plateau. Here, the altitude is over 4,000 meters, with strong winds and harsh climate. The farm was still in its initial stages of construction. At night, she lay on her bed, unable to sleep for a long time. She had imagined the military farm to be rows of neat houses, with vast fields where tractors roared. But the reality was far from her imagination. The more she thought, the more restless she felt. It was already late at night, and she lit a lamp, opening her "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao said, "The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's words illuminated her heart, making her realize she had wavered in the face of difficulty. She thought, fearing difficulty means not being able to follow Chairman Mao's words to the letter, which is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. She recalled the Red Army's Long March, climbing snowy mountains, crossing grasslands, eating tree bark and grass roots. She realized this place was the best classroom for transforming her thoughts, the best battlefield for "devoting one's limited life to the boundless service of the people." She wrote in her diary, "With the resolve of Yu Gong, I will have the determination to build a new Tibet and serve the people wholeheartedly." From then on, she seized every opportunity to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. When there was no oil for the lamp, she would gather some firewood and study by the firelight at night. The more she studied, the clearer her direction became, and the brighter her thoughts.

	Learning from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

	Cheng Zhenying's platoon had veterans who had gone through gunfire, former serfs, and young people like her who had come to support the border. It was a good place for her to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	When Cheng Zhenying first arrived at the platoon, the influence of the bourgeoisie-controlled school immediately showed: she was afraid of getting dirty. She found it hard to communicate with Tibetan peasants and could not eat tsampa and butter tea. The veterans spoke straightforwardly, unlike the "refined" speech of intellectuals. These things made her uncomfortable. Her thoughts and feelings affected her unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they in turn did not like her student manner. Facing these situations, she opened the red book and reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Comparing untransformed intellectuals with workers and peasants, one feels that intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Chairman Mao's words made her realize that her class feelings were problematic, still rooted in petty-bourgeois ideas, and she must strive to transform her worldview. At this time, she encountered two incidents: one was when she went to the potato field, and comrades asked her where the potatoes grew. She pointed to the blue flowers on the vines and said, "Aren't they growing on the vines?" Her words made everyone laugh. Another incident was when the platoon was preparing to build an irrigation canal, and she was asked to look at the blueprints, but she couldn't understand them. Workers and peasants, however, understood them. Through these two incidents, she realized she must humbly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. From then on, she took workers, peasants, and soldiers as her teachers, learning diligently, and working together with them, sweating side by side. Previously, she couldn't eat tsampa and butter tea, but now she could sit with Tibetan brothers and sisters on the same cushion, drink from the same pot of butter tea, and eat from the same "tanggu" of tsampa. She often visited Tibetan peasants' homes, asking about their hardships, receiving education, and doing good deeds for them. In the platoon, she often chatted with comrades, helping them mend and wash clothes and bedding. The more she interacted with them, the more her feelings changed. She saw the deeply wronged Tibetans as good teachers for her class education and the retired soldiers who had shed blood and sweat for the revolution as examples, learning their selfless spirit. In this way, she learned many things she could not have learned in school. Because Cheng Zhenying humbly learned from workers, peasants, and soldiers, comrades said, "We workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome such support-the-border intellectual youth."

	Growing Through Labor

	Cheng Zhenying had participated in some extracurricular labor in school, but compared to the year-round labor on the farm—digging irrigation canals, plowing, watering, sowing, and harvesting—it was a different story. After a day's work, she was so tired that her back, arms, and legs ached. Facing the "labor barrier," her thoughts fluctuated again, feeling that the farm's labor was too exhausting. When this thought arose, she repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works, "The Three Constantly Read Articles." The four shining words, "completely" and "thoroughly," struck her mind's bourgeois "self." Fear of hardship and fatigue was the bourgeois "self" at work, and this "fear" was a manifestation of petty-bourgeois vacillation and weakness. Cheng Zhenying, targeting her own weaknesses, changed her name to Cheng Gang, determined to temper her character to be as hard as steel. She wrote in her diary again, "No matter how difficult, I am not afraid. I have the great resolve to farm for the revolution, and I am infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, determined to take root in Tibet."

	After correctly solving the problem of hardship and fatigue, her mind became clear, and she resolutely took the path of intellectual laborization. In December on the Tibetan plateau, it was already a season of ice and snow. She and her comrades, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," rushed to dig irrigation canals to drain accumulated water and prepare for land reclamation. Although the canal water was frozen, she fearlessly took off her shoes and socks, rolled up her pants, and was the first to jump into the water, engaging in intense labor. Her hands, feet, and legs were cut with bloody wounds, but she did not complain, continuing to fight. When the intense spring irrigation began, to ensure thorough watering, quick irrigation, and no water waste, she simply took off her shoes and went into the icy-cold water to work. When her feet became numb from the cold, she sang, "With resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." From her living quarters to the fields, it took nearly two hours round trip. To save every second, she and her comrades brought steamed buns to the fields, found some rotten firewood in the fields at noon to start a fire, threw the buns into the fire to warm them, and found a block of ice on the mountain. A bun and a piece of ice, eating with great satisfaction.

	One day during irrigation, only she was on the construction site. Suddenly, the irrigation canal collapsed. She thought, what to do? Go back and call for help? The breach would become bigger. Try to block it alone? It would be a bit difficult. "This army has an unyielding spirit, it will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies. No matter how difficult and harsh the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's voice echoed in her ears, and she fearlessly jumped into the water, fighting against the water, and finally blocked the breach. When she walked out of the accumulated water, her feet and legs were frozen purple, and her whole body was covered in mud. But when she thought that this was for serving the people, her mood was particularly pleasant.

	Cheng Zhenying believed: to devote one's limited life completely and thoroughly to the people, one must seize every opportunity to do what one can. She tenaciously overcame all difficulties on the path forward, studied hard, and currently, she has mastered the techniques of sowing, harvesting, fertilizing, and irrigating, and has also learned to drive a horse-drawn carriage and swing a large hammer. When comrades mention her, they call her "Steel Girl."

	Cheng Zhenying, reviewing her journey, deeply felt: intellectuals must first laborize to achieve ideological transformation. Whether or not to take the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers is a touchstone for testing a young person's loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by humbly learning from workers and peasants, tempering oneself through labor, getting calluses on one's hands, and tanning one's face, can one increase one's feelings for the working people and forge a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Currently, Cheng Zhenying is continuing to advance along the path guided by Chairman Mao, determined to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

    沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路前进
    ——记在西藏高原立足生根的女知识青年程振英
    在西藏高原某军垦农场的田间大道上，一位英姿飒爽的姑娘，手挥长鞭，赶着马车，乐哈哈地唱道：“锦绣河山美如画，祖国建设跨骏马。我当个军垦战士多荣耀，肩扛铁锹种庄稼……”这位姑娘就是深受藏族农工和军垦战士欢迎的支边知识青年，某军垦农场副连长程振英。
    听毛主席的话　立志去边疆
    一九六六年，程振英高中刚毕业，就听到了人民解放军西藏军区到河南省招收支边知识青年的消息。她想，革命先辈为无产阶级打江山，我们青年一代就要保江山，建设江山。我应该听毛主席的话，到祖国最需要的地方——边疆去，同工农兵结合，接受艰苦斗争的冶炼，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，为保卫和建设无产阶级的江山贡献力量。她说服了家庭和亲友，毅然报名参加了支边的行列，当上一名军垦战士。
    一九六六年十一月，程振英满怀建设边疆的豪情壮志，到达了战斗岗位——西藏高原某军垦农场。这里海拔四千多米，风沙大，气候差，农场还属于初建阶段。晚上，她躺在地铺上，久久不能入睡。她原来认为军垦农场是一排排整洁的房子，在一望无际的大块土地上，拖拉机隆隆飞奔着。而眼前的农场，和她想象的完全是两回事。她越想思想上越不安定。这时，已是深夜了，她起来点着灯，翻开《毛主席语录》。毛主席说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的话，照亮了她的心，使她猛醒，意识到自己是在困难面前动摇了。她想，怕困难，就不能做到对毛主席的话句句照办，这就是对毛主席的最大不忠。她又联想起红军在二万五千里长征时，爬雪山、过草地，吃树皮、吃草根的艰苦岁月，认识到这个地方，正是自己改造思想最好的大课堂，是“把有限的生命，投入到无限的‘为人民服务’之中去”的最好战场。她提起笔在自己日记本上写下“立下愚公志，长期有决心，建设新西藏，全心为人民”的誓言。从此，她抓紧一切时机活学活用毛主席著作，没有灯油，就拣些柴禾，晚上围着篝火学习，越学方向越明，思想越亮。
    拜工农兵为师
    程振英所在的连队，有经过枪林弹雨考验的退伍老战士，有农奴出身的农工，也有和她一起支边的青年。是她和工农兵结合的好天地。
    当程振英刚到连队时，资产阶级知识分子统治的学校给她的影响马上表现出来了：她怕脏。和藏族农工接触，语言不懂，又吃不来酥油、糌粑。退伍战士平时发言直来直去，不象知识分子讲话那样“文雅”。这些，她都不习惯。她的这种思想感情影响着她和工农兵结合，而工农兵也看不惯她的学生腔。面对这些情况，她打开红色宝书，重温毛主席的教导：“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”毛主席的话，使她认识到自己的阶级感情有问题，还是小资产阶级的那一套，必须努力改造自己的世界观。就在这时，她又碰到两件事：一是走到土豆地里，同志们问她土豆结在什么地方，她看到土豆开着的蓝花儿说，那还不是结到秧上吗！她一说，惹得同志们都笑了。另一件事，连队里准备修水渠，叫她看图纸，结果看不懂。而工农出身的干部，就看懂了。通过这两件事，使她认识到必须老老实实向工农兵学习。从此，她拜工农兵为师，虚心学习，和大家一起挥镐斩棘，汗水流到一起。以前，她吃不惯酥油、糌粑，今天，已经能和藏族兄弟姐妹坐在一个卡垫上，用一个壶喝酥油茶，在一个“唐古”里抓糌粑了。她还经常深入到藏族农工家里，访贫问苦，接受教育，并为群众做好事。在连里她经常和同志们一起谈心，帮助同志们缝缝补补，拆洗衣被。和大家接触多了，感情就起了变化。她把苦大仇深的藏胞作为对自己进行阶级教育的好老师，把为革命流血流汗、兢兢业业为党工作的退伍战士作为榜样，学习他们毫不利己专门利人的精神。这样，她学到了许多过去在学校里学不到的东西。由于程振英放下知识分子的架子，虚心向工农兵学习，同志们都说：“我们工农兵欢迎这样的支边知识青年。”
    在劳动中锻炼成长
    程振英过去虽然在学校也参加过一些课余劳动，但和农场里挖水渠、翻地、灌水、播种、收割等一年四季闲不下的劳动比较，还是两码事，这里干完一天，累的腰痛臂痛腿又酸。面对劳动“关”，她的思想又翻腾起来了，感到农场的劳动太累人。活的思想出现后，她就反复学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。“完全”、“彻底”四个金光闪闪的大字，射中了她头脑中的资产阶级“私”字。怕苦怕累本身就是“私”字作怪，这个“怕”字，又是小资产阶级的动摇性、脆弱性的表现。程振英针对自己的弱点，改名为程钢，决心把自己的性格锻炼得象钢铁那样坚硬。她在自己的日记本上又一次写下誓言：“千难万难我不怕，为革命种田决心大，无限忠于毛主席，誓在西藏把根扎。”
    她正确解决了苦与累的问题后，心里亮堂了，坚决走知识分子劳动化的道路。西藏高原的十二月，已是千里冰封、万里雪飘的季节。她和战友一起，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，为了排出积水，进行开荒，紧张地抢挖排水渠。虽然渠水结了冰，但她毫不畏惧，她脱掉鞋袜，卷起裤筒，第一个跳下水去，投入了紧张的劳动。手、脚和腿裂了一道道血口子，她也不叫苦，一直坚持战斗。紧张的春灌开始时，为了灌的透，浇的快，又不浪费水，她又干脆脱掉鞋，下到寒冷刺骨的水里去干。时间长了，脚冻麻木的时候，就高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录歌。从住地到田间，来回需要近两小时，为了争分夺秒，她和战友们带上馒头下地，中午在地里拣点烂柴草生火，把馒头扔在火里烤烤，在山上搬块冰，一口馒头一块冰，吃得满香甜。
    有一天灌水时，工地上只有她一人，突然水渠冲垮了。她想，怎么办？回去叫人吧？口子越冲越大，一个人堵吧？有点困难。“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的声音在她耳边回响，她毫不犹豫地跳到水中，与水奋战，终于把口子堵住了。待她走出积水时，脚腿冻得发紫，浑身上下成了泥人。但当她想到这是为人民服务，心情特别舒畅。
    程振英认为：要把有限的生命完全彻底地献给人民，就要抓紧一切时机去做力所能及的工作。她顽强地克服前进道路上的一切困难，努力学习，目前，播种、收割、施肥、灌溉等技术，她都基本上掌握了，还学会了赶马车、抡大锤。同志们一提起她，都叫她“钢姑娘”。
    程振英回顾自己走过的道路深有体会地说：知识分子要实现思想革命化，首先要劳动化。走不走与工农兵相结合的道路，是考验一个青年对毛主席，对毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线忠不忠的试金石。只有老老实实向工农学习，到劳动中锻炼，手上长上茧，脸晒黑了，才能够增强劳动人民的感情，炼出一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。当前，程振英正在继续沿着毛主席指引的道路阔步前进，决心永远跟着毛主席干革命。
