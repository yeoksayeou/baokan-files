The great proletarian cultural revolution in our country has achieved tremendous and decisive victories! The 1968 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair is being successfully held in Guangzhou. This fair, with its new look and unprecedented scale, showcases to friends from the five continents the bountiful fruits of the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution and displays the new situation of rapid development in socialist construction in our country under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Many friends from various countries have seen with their own eyes that socialist China, after more than two years of the great proletarian cultural revolution, presents a thriving scene. This makes them deeply feel that the capitalist world is on the decline, while socialist China is full of vitality and making rapid progress. During their visit to China, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association visited the fair. Upon returning to Tokyo, the head of the delegation said in his reflections on his visit to China: "The great proletarian cultural revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao is achieving comprehensive victory. This great revolution is making China a permanent socialist power and the most reliable stronghold of revolutionary forces worldwide. The great situation that has emerged under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought contrasts sharply with the increasing difficulties faced by U.S. imperialism and the increasing failures of Soviet revisionism."

The great proletarian cultural revolution is a great driving force for socialist production in our country. The more than 30,000 items on display at this fair fully demonstrate the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and the bountiful fruits created by our people in the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao.

Under the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class in our country has boldly stepped onto the stage of the struggle-criticism-transformation of the superstructure, fully playing the leading role of the working class. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, in the great proletarian cultural revolution, they have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, smashed all unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the initiative and creativity of the workers, dared to tread paths where no one has gone before, dared to scale peaks where no one has reached, and created miracle after miracle. The many industrial new products exhibited at this fair are a reflection of the new leap-forward situation on the industrial front in our country. Particularly noteworthy is the large number of new products exhibited at this fair. Among the thousands of textile products, 70% are new products and new designs, and 60% of various machinery products are new products. Among them, more than 20 machine tools were successfully trial-produced in the high tide of the great proletarian cultural revolution achieving comprehensive victory. There are also many major new achievements in precision instruments, chemical products, medical equipment, hardware, and steel materials. These facts fully reflect that the industrial front in our country is undergoing extremely profound changes, which is: the working class, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, executing the great historical mission of "the working class must lead everything," after taking hold of the leadership of enterprise production and technological leadership, has once again greatly liberated the productive forces. At this fair, Shanghai provided more industrial new products than ever before. This is the new achievement created by more than a million industrial workers in Shanghai who have seized back the technological leadership from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and reactionary technical "authorities" and used their own hands and wisdom. The famous Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's large plane grinder with international advanced level, successfully trial-produced in May this year, is one of the latest contributions of the Shanghai working class to the cause of socialist construction. There are many products like the large plane grinder that embody the wisdom of the working class. The 200,000-times large electron microscope exhibited in the instrument hall is also a new contribution of the Shanghai working class. This is an advanced precision instrument indispensable for scientific research departments to explore the microscopic world and develop modern science and technology. This important equipment was successfully trial-produced in just over eight months by a young technician selected from the workers to study at the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical School's worker-peasant class and an old worker together through arduous efforts. This type of microscope is currently only produced by a few industrially developed countries in the world. This great achievement fully demonstrates the great wisdom of the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "follow the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's way of cultivating technical personnel from among the workers."

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party says: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it produces tremendous material force." In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in our country have advanced along the bright path of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. With high revolutionary enthusiasm, they have achieved bumper harvests year after year, providing a solid material foundation for the development of our foreign trade. The rich agricultural products exhibited at this fair from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in our country fully reflect the good situation of bumper harvests in agriculture year after year, demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system in our rural areas, and reflect the thriving and prosperous scene of our vast rural areas.

The grains, oils, and foodstuffs exhibited at the fair have increased from over 2,500 varieties before the great proletarian cultural revolution to more than 3,000 varieties now; the export quantities of major commodities such as soybeans, oilseeds, rice, sugar, meat, and canned foods have all increased. Now, the sources of agricultural products are no longer limited to the fertile coastal provinces and the relatively high-yielding plains. The inland plateaus, mountainous areas, and previously low-yielding border regions also provide many agricultural products for the fair. Here, one can see high-quality rice, wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed from the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. One can also see that the broad masses of commune members in Tibet, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other border regions have developed hunting and the exploitation of mountain resources, providing the state with a large number of high-value local specialties. The development of China's traditional export tea is also very rapid. In recent years, the tea-growing area in the new tea regions of the southern provinces has expanded rapidly. Guangdong Province alone expanded its tea gardens by 100,000 mu in 1966. China's livestock breeding industry has developed rapidly, and the vast pastoral areas have had bumper harvests, providing the fair with sufficient livestock products.

Every session of the fair held in Guangzhou attracts trade friends from the five continents. This session, held amidst the triumphant songs of the great proletarian cultural revolution achieving comprehensive victory, has seen an unprecedented number of guests. Among the guests are government trade officials and representatives of state-owned companies from many newly independent nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, trade merchants and businesspeople from various European countries, and representatives of friendly trading companies from various parts of Japan. They have expressed their views at the fair, praising the success of this session.

A French trade friend who participated in the fair for the first time signed several purchase contracts at this session. This friend said that trade circles and the broad masses of consumers in France are all interested in Chinese goods. Many merchants in Western countries are also willing to deal with the Chinese people and are very interested in developing trade with China and are optimistic about the future. A Nordic trade friend said that he had visited a factory in Foshan, which was just a small workshop specializing in repair work before the great proletarian cultural revolution, but now it has high-performance machines, and every worker looks full of vigor. They are producing agricultural machinery equipment in batches. This example also shows that China's industry is developing rapidly and is not the so-called "stagnation" or "retreat" fabricated by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. A friend from a Western country who has participated in the fair in China many times said that the scale of this session is larger than in previous years. He has no worries about the sufficient supply of Chinese goods he needs to purchase. Chinese export commodities are of good quality, reasonably priced, and have a good reputation in the international market. An Australian trade friend praised China's consistent policy of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange in foreign trade. He believes that the potential of 700 million Chinese people is enormous, and after this great proletarian cultural revolution, China's foreign trade will grow rapidly.

Many foreign trade friends have refuted the slanders and fabrications of the propaganda machines of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism about the fair with the facts they have seen with their own eyes. The success of the fair has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries very afraid, and they have done their utmost to attack and curse China's foreign trade policy. However, it is easy for an ant to shake a tree. Socialist China is advancing with the triumphant songs of the great proletarian cultural revolution, let those buzzing anti-China flies cry!

　　文化大革命的丰硕成果
　　——一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会侧记
    东风劲吹，红旗招展，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利！
    一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会正在广州胜利举行。这次交易会以崭新的面貌，空前的规模，向与会的五大洲的外国朋友展示了无产阶级文化大革命胜利的丰硕成果，展现了我国人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，社会主义建设飞跃发展的新形势。
    来自各国的许多朋友，在交易会上亲眼看到社会主义的中国，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命，呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。这使他们深深感到：资本主义世界日薄西山，气息奄奄；社会主义的中国朝气蓬勃，一日千里。日中友好协会（正统）、日中文化交流协会联合代表团负责人在中国访问期间参观了交易会，他在回到东京发表访华观感时说：“伟大领袖毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在取得全面胜利。这场大革命正在使中国成为永不变色的社会主义大国和全世界革命力量最可靠的堡垒。在毛泽东思想的指导下出现的大好形势，同美帝国主义日益严重的困难和苏联修正主义日益严重的破产，形成了鲜明的对比。”
    无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力。这次交易会上展出的三万多种产品，充分说明我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，焕发出来的冲天革命干劲和所创造的丰硕成果。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的号召下，我国工人阶级豪迈地登上了上层建筑斗批改的舞台，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以无产阶级彻底革命的精神，在无产阶级文化大革命中，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义路线，砸烂了束缚工人积极性和创造性的一切不合理的规章制度，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，创造出了一个又一个奇迹。这次交易会展出的许多具有国际先进水平的工业新产品，就是我国工业战线出现的新的跃进局面的写照。引人注意的是这次交易会展出的新产品特别多，在几千种纺织品中，新产品、新花色就占百分之七十，各种机械产品中有百分之六十是新产品，其中二十多台机床全是在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的高潮中试制成功的新产品。精密仪器、化工产品、医疗器械、五金钢材等，也有许多重大的新成就。这些事实充分反映了我国工业战线正在发生极其深刻的变化，这就是：工人阶级紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，执行“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大历史使命，掌握了企业生产的领导大权和技术领导大权之后，又一次大大地解放了生产力。在这次交易会上，上海提供的工业新产品，比历届交易会都多。这是上海一百多万产业工人夺回了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的技术领导大权，用自己的双手和智慧创造出来的新成果。著名的上海机床厂今年五月试制成功的具有国际先进水平的大型平面磨床，就是上海工人阶级为社会主义建设事业作出的最新贡献之一。象大型平面磨床一样凝聚着工人阶级聪明才智的产品还很多。在仪器馆展出的一台二十万倍大型电子显微镜，也是上海工人阶级的新贡献之一。这是科学研究部门用来探索微观世界、发展近代科学技术不可缺少的高级精密仪器。这台重要设备是上海光学技术研究所的一位从工人中选拔到上海机械制造学校工农班学习毕业的年青技术员，和老工人一起，经过艰苦奋斗，在短短八个多月的时间内试制成功的。这种显微镜，目前世界上只有少数几个工业发达的国家才能制造。这一巨大成就，充分显示了伟大领袖毛主席的“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的伟大指示无比英明。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报说：“毛泽东思想被广大人民群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国亿万贫下中农沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的“农业学大寨”的光辉道路阔步前进。他们以高昂的革命热情，夺取了连年丰收，为我国发展对外贸易提供了雄厚的物质基础。在这次交易会上展出的来自我国二十九个省、市、自治区的丰富的农产品，充分反映了我国农业连年丰收的大好形势，显示了我国农村人民公社制度的无比优越性，反映了我国广大农村蒸蒸日上的一片繁荣兴旺景象。
    在交易会上展出的粮油和食品，已由无产阶级文化大革命之前的二千五百多种增加到现在的三千多种；大豆、油料、大米、砂糖、肉类以及罐头食品等大宗商品的出口数量，都有增长。现在农产品的来源已不仅仅限于富饶的沿海省份和生产水平较高的平原地区。内陆高原山区和原来生产水平较低的边疆地区，也为交易会提供了许多农产品。在这里，人们可以看到来自天山脚下的优质大米、小麦、蚕豆、油菜籽等。还可以看到西藏、贵州、云南、广西等边疆地区的广大社员发展捕猎和开发山区资源，为国家提供了大量的价值很高的土特产。我国传统出口的茶叶发展也很快。近几年来，南方各省新茶区种茶面积迅速扩展，仅广东省在一九六六年就扩大了十万亩茶园。我国家畜饲养业迅速发展，广大牧区生产丰收，为交易会提供了充足的畜产品货源。
    在广州举行的每届交易会，都吸引着世界五大洲的贸易界朋友。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中举办的本届交易会，更使到会来宾空前踊跃。来宾中有亚非拉地区的许多民族独立国家的政府贸易官员、国营公司代表，欧洲各国的贸易商和企业界人士，以及日本各地的友好商社代表。他们在交易会上纷纷发表观感，盛赞这届交易会的成功。
    一位首次参加交易会的法国贸易界朋友在这届交易会中签订了不少订货合约。这位朋友说，法国贸易界人士和广大消费者，都对中国货感兴趣。西方国家的许多商人也都愿意同中国人民来往，都对发展与中国贸易大有兴趣，并且对前途表示乐观。一位北欧贸易界朋友说，他这次参观过佛山的一家工厂，这个厂在无产阶级文化大革命以前，还只是一家专做修配工作的小工场，但现在却拥有性能良好的机器，而且每个职工都显得朝气蓬勃，他们正在生产成批成批的农业机械设备。这个例子也说明，目前中国的工业正在迅速发展，而绝不是帝、修、反所胡诌的什么“停滞”或“倒退”。多次来我国参加交易会的一位西方国家的朋友说，这届交易会的规模比往年更大。他所需要购买的中国商品，不愁没有足够的供应。中国出口商品的品质优良，价格合理，在国际市场上很有威信。一位澳大利亚贸易界朋友赞扬我国一贯奉行平等互利，互通有无的对外贸易政策。他认为七亿中国人民的潜力很大，经过这次无产阶级文化大革命之后，中国的对外贸易将会迅速增长。
    许多外国贸易界朋友在发表观感中，用他们亲眼所见的事实，有力地驳斥了美帝、苏修宣传机器对交易会的造谣污蔑。交易会的成功，使帝、修、反感到十分害怕，它们极尽破坏之能事，拚命攻击和咒骂中国的对外贸易政策。但是，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。社会主义中国在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中正在阔步前进，让那些嗡嗡叫的反华小苍蝇去哭泣吧！
