The great proletarian cultural revolution in our country has achieved tremendous and decisive victories! The 1968 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair is being successfully held in Guangzhou. This fair, with its new look and unprecedented scale, showcases to friends from the five continents the bountiful fruits of the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution and displays the new situation of rapid development in socialist construction in our country under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Many friends from various countries have seen with their own eyes that socialist China, after more than two years of the great proletarian cultural revolution, presents a thriving scene. This makes them deeply feel that the capitalist world is on the decline, while socialist China is full of vitality and making rapid progress. During their visit to China, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association visited the fair. Upon returning to Tokyo, the head of the delegation said in his reflections on his visit to China: "The great proletarian cultural revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao is achieving comprehensive victory. This great revolution is making China a permanent socialist power and the most reliable stronghold of revolutionary forces worldwide. The great situation that has emerged under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought contrasts sharply with the increasing difficulties faced by U.S. imperialism and the increasing failures of Soviet revisionism."

The great proletarian cultural revolution is a great driving force for socialist production in our country. The more than 30,000 items on display at this fair fully demonstrate the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and the bountiful fruits created by our people in the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao.

Under the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class in our country has boldly stepped onto the stage of the struggle-criticism-transformation of the superstructure, fully playing the leading role of the working class. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, in the great proletarian cultural revolution, they have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, smashed all unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the initiative and creativity of the workers, dared to tread paths where no one has gone before, dared to scale peaks where no one has reached, and created miracle after miracle. The many industrial new products exhibited at this fair are a reflection of the new leap-forward situation on the industrial front in our country. Particularly noteworthy is the large number of new products exhibited at this fair. Among the thousands of textile products, 70% are new products and new designs, and 60% of various machinery products are new products. Among them, more than 20 machine tools were successfully trial-produced in the high tide of the great proletarian cultural revolution achieving comprehensive victory. There are also many major new achievements in precision instruments, chemical products, medical equipment, hardware, and steel materials. These facts fully reflect that the industrial front in our country is undergoing extremely profound changes, which is: the working class, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, executing the great historical mission of "the working class must lead everything," after taking hold of the leadership of enterprise production and technological leadership, has once again greatly liberated the productive forces. At this fair, Shanghai provided more industrial new products than ever before. This is the new achievement created by more than a million industrial workers in Shanghai who have seized back the technological leadership from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and reactionary technical "authorities" and used their own hands and wisdom. The famous Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's large plane grinder with international advanced level, successfully trial-produced in May this year, is one of the latest contributions of the Shanghai working class to the cause of socialist construction. There are many products like the large plane grinder that embody the wisdom of the working class. The 200,000-times large electron microscope exhibited in the instrument hall is also a new contribution of the Shanghai working class. This is an advanced precision instrument indispensable for scientific research departments to explore the microscopic world and develop modern science and technology. This important equipment was successfully trial-produced in just over eight months by a young technician selected from the workers to study at the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical School's worker-peasant class and an old worker together through arduous efforts. This type of microscope is currently only produced by a few industrially developed countries in the world. This great achievement fully demonstrates the great wisdom of the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "follow the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's way of cultivating technical personnel from among the workers."

The communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party says: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it produces tremendous material force." In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in our country have advanced along the bright path of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. With high revolutionary enthusiasm, they have achieved bumper harvests year after year, providing a solid material foundation for the development of our foreign trade. The rich agricultural products exhibited at this fair from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in our country fully reflect the good situation of bumper harvests in agriculture year after year, demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system in our rural areas, and reflect the thriving and prosperous scene of our vast rural areas.

The grains, oils, and foodstuffs exhibited at the fair have increased from over 2,500 varieties before the great proletarian cultural revolution to more than 3,000 varieties now; the export quantities of major commodities such as soybeans, oilseeds, rice, sugar, meat, and canned foods have all increased. Now, the sources of agricultural products are no longer limited to the fertile coastal provinces and the relatively high-yielding plains. The inland plateaus, mountainous areas, and previously low-yielding border regions also provide many agricultural products for the fair. Here, one can see high-quality rice, wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed from the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. One can also see that the broad masses of commune members in Tibet, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other border regions have developed hunting and the exploitation of mountain resources, providing the state with a large number of high-value local specialties. The development of China's traditional export tea is also very rapid. In recent years, the tea-growing area in the new tea regions of the southern provinces has expanded rapidly. Guangdong Province alone expanded its tea gardens by 100,000 mu in 1966. China's livestock breeding industry has developed rapidly, and the vast pastoral areas have had bumper harvests, providing the fair with sufficient livestock products.

Every session of the fair held in Guangzhou attracts trade friends from the five continents. This session, held amidst the triumphant songs of the great proletarian cultural revolution achieving comprehensive victory, has seen an unprecedented number of guests. Among the guests are government trade officials and representatives of state-owned companies from many newly independent nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, trade merchants and businesspeople from various European countries, and representatives of friendly trading companies from various parts of Japan. They have expressed their views at the fair, praising the success of this session.

A French trade friend who participated in the fair for the first time signed several purchase contracts at this session. This friend said that trade circles and the broad masses of consumers in France are all interested in Chinese goods. Many merchants in Western countries are also willing to deal with the Chinese people and are very interested in developing trade with China and are optimistic about the future. A Nordic trade friend said that he had visited a factory in Foshan, which was just a small workshop specializing in repair work before the great proletarian cultural revolution, but now it has high-performance machines, and every worker looks full of vigor. They are producing agricultural machinery equipment in batches. This example also shows that China's industry is developing rapidly and is not the so-called "stagnation" or "retreat" fabricated by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. A friend from a Western country who has participated in the fair in China many times said that the scale of this session is larger than in previous years. He has no worries about the sufficient supply of Chinese goods he needs to purchase. Chinese export commodities are of good quality, reasonably priced, and have a good reputation in the international market. An Australian trade friend praised China's consistent policy of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange in foreign trade. He believes that the potential of 700 million Chinese people is enormous, and after this great proletarian cultural revolution, China's foreign trade will grow rapidly.

Many foreign trade friends have refuted the slanders and fabrications of the propaganda machines of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism about the fair with the facts they have seen with their own eyes. The success of the fair has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries very afraid, and they have done their utmost to attack and curse China's foreign trade policy. However, it is easy for an ant to shake a tree. Socialist China is advancing with the triumphant songs of the great proletarian cultural revolution, let those buzzing anti-China flies cry!
