Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "tighten up cotton production," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hebei Province have overcome severe drought and pestilence to achieve a bumper cotton harvest this year. The cotton planting area is basically the same as last year, but the total output has increased by more than 10 percent. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the cotton-producing areas are celebrating the bumper cotton harvest and, with their profound proletarian feelings of love for Chairman Mao, are actively selling their new cotton to the state. By the end of October, the province had purchased 40 percent more new cotton than the same period last year. Counties such as Daming, Guangping, Wuxian, Dongguang, Yanshan, and Fengnan have already exceeded their annual targets for selling new cotton.

Before selling their new cotton, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hebei's cotton-producing areas held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle, purging the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts spread by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his local agents. By raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants immediately launched a movement to sell new cotton to the state.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Fuzhou on November 7, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants along the coast of Fujian Province, following Chairman Mao's great teaching to "advance to every place and department where one can exert one's strength, and to the depth and breadth of production," have vigorously developed the artificial cultivation of kelp and laver. This year, kelp has seen an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the total output of dried kelp nearly doubling compared to last year and more than doubling compared to 1966. Moreover, the processing quality has significantly improved. The artificially cultivated laver has begun to be harvested, and it is estimated that the total output of dried laver this year will increase by more than eight times compared to last year.

Over the past two years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants along the coast of Fujian Province have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle, purged the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi in the breeding and production industry, organized the masses to advance to the shallow seas and beaches, and opened up a new situation in the artificial cultivation of kelp and laver. In the past two years, more than 20 counties and cities along the coast of the province, as well as communes and production brigades near the sea, have generally developed the breeding of algae. Before 1964, the artificial cultivation of laver was only tested in a few plots in the Jinjiang County laver breeding experimental station. Now, it has been widely cultivated in most coastal counties such as Lianjiang, Huian, Putian, Changle, Xiapu, Luoyuan, Zhangpu, Fuding, and others.

Currently, the harvested kelp is not only transported to Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangxi provinces and regions but is also extensively used in comprehensive ways in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Lianjiang, Putian, Fuding, Xiapu, and other places to meet the production needs of China's pharmaceutical, metallurgical, and chemical industries.

    在毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的伟大号召下
    河北棉花丰收广大贫下中农踊跃交售新棉
    福建海带紫菜人工养殖事业迅速发展
    新华社石家庄九日电　在伟大领袖毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的伟大号召下，河北省广大贫下中农战胜严重干旱和虫灾，获得了今年的棉花丰收，棉花种植面积与去年基本相等，总产量却比去年增加一成以上。产棉区的广大贫下中农喜庆棉花丰收，怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，积极向国家交售新棉。截止十月底，全省收购的新棉比去年同期增长百分之四十以上。大名、广平、吴桥、东光、盐山、丰南等县已经超额完成全年新棉交售任务。
    河北产棉区的广大贫下中农在交售新棉前，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，肃清大叛徒刘少奇及其在当地的代理人所散布的反革命修正主义思想，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者的关系。广大贫下中农由于提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，立即掀起了向国家交售新棉的热潮。
    据新华社福州七日电　福建沿海广大贫下中农遵循毛主席“向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军”的伟大教导，大力发展海带、紫菜人工养殖事业。今年海带获得了空前大丰收，晒干的海带，总产量比去年增长将近一倍，比一九六六年增长两倍以上，而且加工的质量显著提高。人工养殖的紫菜已开始收获，预计今年干紫菜的总产量可比去年增加八倍以上。
    两年多来，福建沿海广大贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展革命大批判，肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义路线在养殖生产事业的流毒，组织群众向浅海和海滩进军，打开了海带、紫菜人工养殖生产的崭新局面。全省沿海二十多个县、市靠海的社、队，这两年来普遍发展了藻类养殖事业。紫菜人工养殖，一九六四年以前全省只在晋江县紫菜养殖试验场试养几亩，现在已在连江、惠安、莆田、长乐、霞浦、罗源、漳浦、福鼎等绝大部分靠海县份的社、队大面积养殖。
    目前，丰收的海带，除运往江西、湖南、四川、广西等省、区外，还大量地在福州、厦门、连江、莆田、福鼎、霞浦等地进行综合利用，供应我国医药、冶金和化学工业的生产需要。
