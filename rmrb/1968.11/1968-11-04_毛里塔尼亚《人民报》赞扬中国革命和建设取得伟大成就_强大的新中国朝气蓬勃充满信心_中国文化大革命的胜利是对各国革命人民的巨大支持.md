	Mauritania's *People's Daily* praises the great achievements of China's revolution and construction. The powerful new China is full of vigor and confidence. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great support to the revolutionary people of all countries.

	Xinhua News Agency, Nouakchott, November 3rd: The organ of the Mauritania People's Party, *People's Daily*, published an editorial on October 28th, praising the glorious history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, and the great achievements made in all fields.

	The editorial, titled "Salute to the People's Republic of China," especially praises the great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The editorial says: "The People's Republic of China has actually been continuously carrying out revolutions on the political, economic, and ideological fronts since its establishment." "Today, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, marking the decisive victory of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong."

	The editorial points out that the powerful new China is full of vigor and confidence. China has consistently spared no effort to support the struggles of the people of all countries against imperialism, Zionism, and their lackeys. The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great support for the struggles of the peoples of Africa and Asia, especially the Arab and Vietnamese peoples.

	The editorial says, although world imperialism and reactionaries have been slandering and defaming China, Mauritania has not been deceived. Mauritania has established friendly relations with the People's Republic of China. The head of state of Mauritania visited this friendly country last October. "Our people extend fraternal congratulations to the great Chinese people and their great party for all the achievements and victories they have made under the leadership of their highly respected leader, Chairman Mao Zedong."

    这篇题为《向中华人民共和国致敬》的社论，特别赞扬中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利。
    社论说：“中华人民共和国实际上从它建立以来一直不断地进行政治、经济和思想战线上的革命”。“今天除台湾省以外，所有二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会，从而标志着中国无产阶级文化大革命在毛泽东主席的领导下取得了决定性的胜利。”
    社论指出，强大的新中国，朝气蓬勃，充满着信心。中国一贯不遗余力地支持各国人民反对帝国主义、犹太复国主义及其走狗的斗争。中国文化大革命的胜利，就是对非洲和亚洲各国人民，特别是对阿拉伯和越南人民的斗争的巨大支持。
    社论说，尽管世界帝国主义和反动派大肆咒骂和诽谤中国，但是毛里塔尼亚没有受骗。毛里塔尼亚已同中华人民共和国建立了友好的关系，毛里塔尼亚国家元首在去年十月访问了这个友好国家。“我国人民对伟大的中国人民及其伟大的党在他们的享有崇高威望的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下所取得的一切成就和一切胜利致以兄弟般的祝贺。”
