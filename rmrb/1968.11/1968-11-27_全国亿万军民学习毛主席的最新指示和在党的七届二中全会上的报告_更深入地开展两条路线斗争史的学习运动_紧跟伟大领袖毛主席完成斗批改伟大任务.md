Nationwide military and civilians are studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. They are deepening the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines and closely following the great leader Chairman Mao to complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

New China News Agency, November 26th: Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell only a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it," and the reissued epoch-making brilliant document, "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," are rapidly becoming a powerful spiritual force for the hundreds of millions of military and civilians in our country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in cities and countryside across the nation, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary Red Guards, with deep proletarian sentiments, have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great seriousness and repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. They have enthusiastically discussed the important editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," and have drawn great benefits from it. They resolutely declare that they will deepen the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to a new height, better arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize and purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi, complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the nation, filled with the joy of victory and fighting spirit, have continued to hold various celebrations, enthusiastically welcoming the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the reissuing of Chairman Mao's brilliant documents. Revolutionary committees in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have held meetings and organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to seriously study the documents. They have also issued notices, calling on members of revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad revolutionary masses to, with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, immediately launch a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. At the same time, revolutionary committees and local military units at all levels have sent out large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's brilliant documents to the masses. Revolutionary committees in Guangdong, Jilin, and Sichuan have organized tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people to form propaganda armies, carrying freshly printed copies of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to factories, villages, pastoral areas, and fishing ports, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. People's Liberation Army units guarding the long borders and coastal defenses have sent propaganda teams to mountains, across seas, into villages, and fishing ports, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's brilliant documents with the revolutionary masses. A widespread and in-depth movement to study the historical experiences of the struggle between the two lines is vigorously unfolding across the nation.

In studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the nationwide military and civilians have deeply realized the great significance of studying the historical experiences of the struggle between the two lines within the party. They say, our party's history of over forty years is a history of the struggle between the two lines, a history of the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, guiding the revolutionary masses from victory to victory, establishing and consolidating proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism. The bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi represents the interests of imperialism, modern revisionism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and all exploiting classes, leading China into darkness, overthrowing proletarian dictatorship, and restoring capitalism. Revolutionary masses and soldiers across the country say, historical experience has proven: the core of the struggle between the two lines is the issue of power. Adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolution is invincible, and proletarian dictatorship is firmly established; without Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolution fails, and proletarian dictatorship will change color.

After studying the party's history of the struggle between the two lines, revolutionary masses across the country have reviewed the more than two-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply felt that studying the historical experiences of the struggle between the two lines within the party and continuously raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is a major issue in continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. Without understanding the struggle between the two lines and without mastering Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one will lose vigilance in the face of the plots of the exploiting classes and their agents to restore capitalism and will lose direction in the sharp and complex class struggle. We must seriously study the historical experiences of the struggle between the two lines within the party, better master Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and better apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on class and class struggle, and on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, allowing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to deeply take root among the masses. Members of revolutionary committees across the country emphasized in their studies that in the current deepening of the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, we must promote the revolutionary style of learning by combining theory with practice, insisting on learning in struggle, in criticism, and in reform, continuously raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and continuously raising the consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the nation are determined to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought higher, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and completely eliminate all its poison. Workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine in Hebei, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as weapons, combined with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in their mine, severely criticized the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the mine. The workers angrily said: The big villain Liu Shaoqi, in May 1949, rushed to our Kailuan Coal Mine, spreading the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious," obscuring the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, which was extremely cunning and vicious. Revolutionary workers at the Lanzhou Longfeng Machinery Factory said: Whether or not to talk about class struggle and the struggle between the two lines; whether to tell only a few people or let the broad revolutionary masses know, this is a major issue concerning the fate of the party and the state. The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi advocated the theory of "extinction of class struggle" and the theory of "peace within the party," aiming to open the door for their usurpation of the party and the state, and the restoration of capitalism. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, in fully implementing the various tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, make full use of Liu Shaoqi as a negative example, continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, clearly distinguish the boundaries between the two lines, raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and thoroughly carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. Peasants in Tianhua Brigade of Guangfu Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, who had suffered persecution from the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, angrily exposed Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of pulling down the red flag and raising the white flag when he came here in 1961, supporting the ghosts and snakes in their rebellion, persecuting and framing revolutionary cadres and poor peasants, and pushing for capitalist restoration. Soldiers of the Third Company of a certain regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, went to the site where Chairman Mao once held the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou, seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, listened to old peasants recount the situation of the struggle between the two lines in rural areas during the socialist revolution, and together with them enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, receiving a profound education. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers resolutely declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's words for life, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life, and be like Li Wentong, the model of supporting the left and loving the people, fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and sacrificing to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead.

Revolutionary masses, members of revolutionary committees at all levels, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" unanimously declared that they would, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and Chairman Mao's other brilliant works, seriously implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They said, only by firmly grasping Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we have a far-reaching vision, a clear direction, and a firm resolve, and only then can we continuously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize. The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Meat Processing Joint Venture, the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory, and all revolutionary workers in the factory, combined with the actual struggle between the two lines in their factory, studied deeply while taking action. They said, the class struggle history of our factory proves that if we do not seriously clean up the class ranks, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated. All revolutionary workers in the factory severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of "extinction of class struggle" and resolved to firmly strike down a handful of class enemies. All members of the revolutionary committee of Ping Shan County in Hebei Province specially held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. They reviewed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, "We must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant and impetuous, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," and unanimously agreed that in the face of the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is essential to firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, which is the fundamental guarantee for strengthening the revolutionary construction of the revolutionary committees and leading the revolutionary masses to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation to the end. They combined the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee with promoting the revolutionary construction of the revolutionary committees and with struggle, criticism, and transformation, further carried forward the party's three great styles, and led the revolutionary masses of the whole county to launch a new high tide of implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army carrying out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" unanimously declared that they would, in the great high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, better study the historical experiences of the struggle between the two lines, continuously raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever be the strong backbone of the working class, and in the great tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, create new achievements for the people.

    全国亿万军民学习毛主席的最新指示和在党的七届二中全会上的报告
    更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动  紧跟伟大领袖毛主席完成斗批改伟大任务
    广大军民决心更好地用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装自己，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟提到新的高度，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社二十六日讯　伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示和重新发表的划时代光辉文献——《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，正在迅速化为我国亿万军民的强大精神力量。全国城乡广大工农兵群众、革命干部、革命知识分子和革命的红卫兵小将，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，极为认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示，反复重温毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，热烈讨论《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志和《解放军报》重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》，从中吸取到极大的教益。他们坚决表示，一定要更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟提到新的高度，更好地用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装自己，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，完成斗、批、改的伟大历史使命，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    连日来，全国城乡亿万军民满怀胜利喜悦和战斗豪情，继续举行各种庆祝活动，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表和毛主席光辉文献的重新发表。各省、市、自治区的革命委员会纷纷召开会议、举办毛泽东思想学习班认真进行学习，并且相继发出通知，号召各级革委会成员和广大革命群众，以只争朝夕的革命精神，立即深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动。在这同时，各地各级革命委员会和各地驻军，纷纷派出大批毛泽东思想宣传队，向广大群众宣传毛主席的最新指示和毛主席的光辉文献。广东、吉林和四川等地革命委员会分别组织了十多万到上百万人的宣传大军，带着赶印出来的毛主席最新指示，赶到工厂、农村、牧区和渔港，让毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，深入人心。守卫在漫长的边境和海防线上的人民解放军部队，派出一支支毛泽东思想宣传队，翻山越岭，扬帆出海，深入山寨、渔村，同革命群众一道，认真学习毛主席的最新指示和毛主席的光辉文献。一个广泛深入地学习两条路线斗争历史经验的群众运动，正在全国城乡蓬勃展开。
    全国军民在学习毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告时，深刻地认识到学习党内两条路线斗争历史经验的伟大意义。他们说，我们党四十多年的历史，就是两条路线的斗争史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的历史。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，代表着无产阶级和广大革命人民的根本利益，是引导革命群众从胜利走向胜利的路线，是建立和巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义的路线。以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，代表着帝国主义、现代修正主义、国民党反动派和一切剥削阶级的利益，是把中国引向黑暗的路线，是颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的路线。各地广大革命群众和解放军指战员说，历史经验雄辩地证明：两条路线斗争的中心，是政权问题。坚持毛主席的革命路线，革命就无往而不胜，无产阶级政权就保得牢；离开了毛主席的革命路线，革命就失败，无产阶级政权就会改变颜色。
    各地军民学习了党的两条路线斗争的历史，回顾了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，深有体会地说，学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，是在无产阶级专政下继续革命的大问题。不懂得两条路线斗争，不掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就会在剥削阶级及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋面前丧失警惕，就会在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中迷失方向。我们一定要认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，更好地掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点，让毛主席的革命路线在群众中深深扎根。各地革委会成员在学习时着重指出，在当前深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，必须发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，坚持在斗争中学，在批判中学，在改革中学，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，不断提高执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    全国亿万军民决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线批臭、批透，彻底清除其一切流毒。河北开滦煤矿广大矿工，以毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，结合本矿阶级斗争和两条路线斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇及其代理人在矿里疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。工人们愤怒地说：大坏蛋刘少奇在一九四九年五月间窜到我们开滦煤矿，大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”的反动谬论，抹煞工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，真是阴险毒辣到了极点。兰州长风机器厂的广大革命职工说：讲不讲阶级斗争和两条路线斗争；是只给少数人讲，还是让广大革命群众都知道，这是关系到党和国家命运的大事。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，鼓吹“党内和平论”，其目的就是为他们篡党篡政、复辟资本主义开方便之门。我们坚决遵照毛主席的伟大教导，在全面落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项任务中，充分利用刘少奇这个反面教员，继续深入开展革命大批判，把两条路线的界限划得清清的，把两条路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的，把斗、批、改搞好、搞彻底。曾经遭受反革命修正主义路线迫害的湖南长沙县广福公社天华大队的广大贫下中农，愤怒地揭发了刘少奇在一九六一年窜到这里拔红旗，插白旗，支持牛鬼蛇神翻天，打击陷害革命干部和贫下中农，大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。广州部队某团三连的指战员，怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，到毛主席当年在广州举办农民运动讲习所的旧址，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，听取老贫农讲述在社会主义革命时期农村两条路线斗争的情况，和他们一起热情赞颂毛主席的革命路线，狠批刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，使大家受到了一次深刻的教育。广大工农兵和革命群众坚决表示，一定要一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子坚持毛主席的革命路线，做到象“支左爱民模范”李文忠那样，生为保卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为保卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    各地广大革命群众、各级革委会成员和战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军指战员一致表示，一定要在毛主席的最新指示、毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的其他光辉著作的指引下，认真落实八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，完成斗、批、改的伟大历史使命。他们说，只有牢牢掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能有远大的眼光，明确的方向，坚强的决心，才能不断革命、彻底革命。武汉肉类联合加工厂革委会、驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和全厂革命职工一道，联系本厂两条路线斗争的实际，一边深入学习，一边落实行动。他们说，我们厂的阶级斗争历史证明，如果不认真清理阶级队伍，无产阶级专政就不能巩固。全厂广大革命职工狠批了刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，决心稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。河北省平山县革委会全体成员，专门举办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习两条路线斗争的历史。他们重温伟大领袖毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，一致认为，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，坚定不移地按照毛主席的指示办事，是加强革委会革命化建设，领导革命群众把斗、批、改进行到底的根本保证。他们把学习毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告同促进革委会的革命化结合起来，同斗、批、改结合起来，进一步发扬党的三大作风，带领全县革命群众掀起了落实八届十二中全会公报的新高潮。担负“三支”“两军”光荣任务的人民解放军指战员纷纷表示，一定要在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，更好地学习两条路线斗争的历史经验，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，永远做工人阶级的坚强后盾，在胜利完成八届十二中全会提出的各项伟大任务中，为人民再立新功。
