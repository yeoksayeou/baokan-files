The People's Air Force is not to be trifled with

Flying Vice-Squadron Commander, Zhang Fusheng, Beijing Air Force Unit

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force is a great army personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is a highly politically conscious and tenaciously fighting tiger that soars through the skies, a steel eagle that defends Chairman Mao, defends the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defends the sacred airspace of the motherland. Therefore, the broad revolutionary masses always deeply love this winged army of workers and peasants; while the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries always spread rumors and slander, using every means to attack our People's Air Force.

The imperialists, modern revisionists, and running dogs of the bourgeoisie reactionaries, such as Liu Shaoqi, are all such villains. When he "visited" Indonesia and saw a demonstration aircraft crash, he immediately put on a servile face and flatteringly comforted the Indonesian Air Force commander, saying, "It doesn't matter, our air force often has such things." How shameless! Not only does he himself lick the boots of the bourgeoisie in a servile manner, but he also fabricates facts and smears our People's Air Force, begging for the favor of the bourgeoisie. This is truly shocking!

Our Air Force is an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, nurtured under the thought of Mao Zedong. Our country's Air Force is fundamentally different from the air forces of all capitalist and revisionist countries. As early as the early days of our Air Force, Chairman Mao pointed out sagely, "Build a strong people's air force to defend the motherland and prepare to defeat the invaders." Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, our People's Air Force has smashed the capitalist-revisionist old framework of rules and regulations, taking a decisive path of highlighting proletarian politics. From small to large, from weak to strong, from a backward situation in technology and aircraft types, it has rapidly leaped to the advanced level of the world, becoming a powerful and new type of proletarian people's air force in the world. This is something that the reactionary and decadent air forces of all capitalist countries that oppress the people cannot compare with. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi insists on comparing the reactionary Indonesian Air Force with the heroic Chinese People's Air Force. This is a great insult and a vicious attack on our People's Air Force. This is also a self-exposure of his counter-revolutionary revisionist face.

We, the air force soldiers, are brave proletarian warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fearing neither hardship nor death. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and in the battles to defend our airspace, we, with a lofty proletarian internationalist spirit and deep hatred for the class enemy, displayed an unbeatable heroic spirit. We fought out the prestige of the Chinese People's Air Force and exposed the paper tiger nature of the U.S. imperialists' "air superiority." In defending the motherland's socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and our boundless love for the working people, completed all the tasks assigned to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee with a selfless communist spirit. We created unprecedented flight safety records in the history of aviation and created miracles that capitalist countries dare not even think of. All this fully demonstrates the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. However, Liu Shaoqi turns a blind eye and deaf ear to these moving heroic epics of the People's Air Force, maliciously defaming the prestige of our People's Air Force. This is the most despicable defamation of our heroic air force's reputation and the most shameless trampling on the dignity of our great motherland. It is also a confession of his betrayal of the proletariat and his willingness to be a running dog of the bourgeoisie reactionaries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly exposed the reactionary face of Liu Shaoqi, the agent of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. We, the air force soldiers, firmly respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, thoroughly settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and his treasonous crimes of betraying the party and the country. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, with a lofty ambition to liberate all mankind, soar high and fly far, and be steel eagles who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Let Liu Shaoqi and his gang, who praise the imperialist countries' air forces that only know how to pursue fame and fortune and are afraid of death, tremble before us forever!

    人民空军不可侮
    北京空军某部飞行副中队长　张福盛
    中国人民解放军空军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队，是具有高度无产阶级政治觉悟和英勇顽强战斗作风的驰骋长空的猛虎，是保卫毛主席、保卫无产阶级专政、保卫祖国神圣领空的万里蓝天上的钢铁雄鹰。因此，广大革命群众总是十分热爱这支飞翔在空中的工农子弟兵；而帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派，总是造谣污蔑，千方百计地攻击我人民空军。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和资产阶级反动派的走狗刘少奇就是这样一个坏家伙。他在“访问”印尼时，当看到一架表演飞机摔毁以后，连忙摆出一副奴才的嘴脸，献媚地安慰印尼空军司令说：“不要紧，我们的空军也常有这样的事。”多么无耻！他不仅自己奴颜媚骨地去舔资产阶级的皮靴，还竟然捏造事实，往我人民空军脸上抹黑，乞讨资产阶级的欢心。真是令人发指！
    我们空军是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的全心全意为人民服务的军队。我国的空军同一切资本主义、修正主义国家的空军有着本质的区别。早在我空军初创时期，毛主席就英明地指出：“建立一支强大的人民空军，保卫祖国，准备战胜侵略者。”在毛主席建军思想的光辉照耀下，我国的人民空军，砸烂了资产阶级修正主义的洋条条旧框框，走坚决突出无产阶级政治的道路，从小到大，从弱到强，从技术、机种落后的局面，迅速跃进到世界的先进水平，成为世界上一支强大的、新型的无产阶级的人民空军。这是一切用来镇压人民的反动的、腐朽的资本主义国家的空军根本不能与之伦比的。可是大叛徒刘少奇却偏要把反动的印尼空军同英雄的中国人民空军相提并论，这是对我人民空军莫大的侮辱，恶毒的攻击！这也是他反革命修正主义嘴脸的自我暴露。
    我们空军战士是用毛泽东思想武装起来的不怕苦不怕死的无产阶级英勇战士。在抗美援朝和保卫祖国领空的战斗中，我们怀着崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神和对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，以有我无敌的英雄气概，发扬“刺刀见红”的战斗作风，杀出了中国人民空军的威风，揭露了美帝“空中优势”的纸老虎本质。在保卫祖国的社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中，我们又怀着对毛主席无限忠诚、对劳动人民无限热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情，以大公无私的共产主义精神，完成了毛主席和党中央交给我们的各项任务，创造了世界航空史上空前的飞行安全纪录，创造了一切资本主义国家连想都不敢想的人间奇迹。这一切，都充分显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力。对于人民空军这些动人心魄的英雄诗篇，刘少奇却视而不见、听而不闻，恶意诋毁我人民空军的威望，这是对我英雄空军声誉最卑鄙的败坏，对我们伟大祖国尊严最无耻的践踏，也是他背叛无产阶级、甘当资产阶级反动派走狗的自供状。
    无产阶级文化大革命彻底揭露了刘少奇这个帝、修、反的代理人的反动面目。我们空军战士坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大号召，彻底清算刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线、进行叛党叛国的滔天罪行。我们一定要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，胸怀解放全人类的凌云壮志，展翅高飞，鹏程万里，誓做无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的钢铁雄鹰。让刘少奇和他一伙所吹捧的那些帝国主义国家的只知追名逐利、贪生怕死的“空中麻雀”在我们面前永远发抖吧！
