	The Marxist-Leninist bimonthly "Marxism-Leninism Enterprise" published in Chile in its third issue has published an editorial, enthusiastically praising the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The editorial says: "In the past nineteen years, China's socialist construction has not only freed the Chinese people from poverty but has also brought its technology, industry, and economy to the level of countries with several centuries of industrial history."

	The editorial points out that the Chinese people have achieved this astonishing development through self-reliance.

	The editorial says that the quality of many products made in China has caught up with and in many cases surpassed the world's most advanced levels.

	The editorial points out: The great victory of the Chinese revolution "is a victory achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought through revolutionary people's war. In the entire process of this protracted struggle, Mao Zedong was adept at discovering the specific characteristics of Chinese reality, determining the specific laws of revolutionary struggle. He was adept at summing up the experiences of the masses and learning from revolutionary practice itself."

	"The Chinese people, through their revolutionary leaders, were the first to expose the treacherous behavior of a group of leaders in the international communist movement that was still hidden at the time. Just as Lenin did in his time, the Chinese Communists resolutely resisted those who distorted and revised Marxism, paving the way for the regrouping of the world revolutionary forces and thus accelerating the liberation cause of all peoples."

	The editorial says: "The Chinese people and their leader Comrade Mao Zedong have opened up a new era in the development of the world revolution."

	The editorial says that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is cultivating a new type of person who can apply Marxism-Leninism to practice, a new type of person who has cast off selfishness and individualism and serves the people wholeheartedly.

	The editorial points out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made China the most reliable base for the world revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has inspired the peoples of various countries and pointed out the way to prevent a relapse into capitalism after the proletariat seizes political power.

	The editorial concludes: In this new glorious historical stage of China and the world revolution, "Marxism-Leninism Enterprise" pays tribute to the Chinese people and their teacher Mao Zedong and expresses resolute support for them.
