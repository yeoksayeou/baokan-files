	You Are My Good Teacher

	On one day in October this year, in the rice fields of the third brigade of Dai'erwan Production Brigade, Huangniwao People's Commune, Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, there was a young female comrade. She was working alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, wading through the mud, and swinging her sickle to cut the rice. She was sweating all over and her clothes were splattered with mud. She was Pei Huaxia, a teacher from Dai'erwan Primary School. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised her, saying, "Teacher Pei has truly changed. She has discarded the 'three whites' and replaced them with a red heart. Such a teacher, we poor and lower-middle peasants can trust."

	Originally, Pei Huaxia often wore white shoes, tied a white headband, and wore a white silk scarf around her neck. Therefore, some commune members called her the "three whites teacher." This spring, when the school took a break for the busy farming season, Pei Huaxia went to plant rice seedlings with the commune members. The commune members were working with great enthusiasm, but she was working lightly and cautiously in the back, afraid to get close to the commune members, fearing that the muddy water would splash on her clothes and dirty them. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very displeased with her behavior. Old poor peasant Huang Jinxing was particularly displeased and wanted to bring up the matter to the school. However, at that time, the school was not managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, so the matter was dropped.

	In May this year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dai'erwan Brigade took over the management of the school. Old poor peasant Huang Jinxing also participated in the management. One night, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep, constantly thinking about managing the school. Suddenly, he thought of Pei Huaxia. He thought, "The teacher herself is afraid of dirt and fatigue, seeks comfort, and does not love labor. How can she cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause? No! We poor and lower-middle peasants managing the school cannot just watch the teacher go down the wrong path. To cultivate teachers and students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture is our poor and lower-middle peasants' duty that cannot be shirked."

	The next day, Huang Jinxing went to the school and had a heart-to-heart talk with Pei Huaxia. Huang Jinxing started by asking, "Pei, do you understand the four characters 'labor is glorious'?" Pei Huaxia said, "I understand." "Then tell me your feelings about participating in labor." "Ah... ah..." Pei Huaxia could not say anything. At this time, Huang Jinxing said affectionately, "Look, what is not created by the laboring people? Cloth is woven by workers, and grain is grown by farmers. For the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants strive to produce more grain and work day and night. Although it is tiring, our hearts are filled with indescribable joy. If a teacher does not love labor, how can she teach students well? To make a revolution, one must labor. Forgetting labor is forgetting the revolution and will slide into the quagmire of revisionism." Pei Huaxia listened and listened, and the more she listened, the clearer her mind became. She felt even more hatred towards Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. She deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants were her best teachers. Therefore, she sincerely said to Huang Jinxing, "You are my good teacher. From today on, I will definitely be a good student of the poor and lower-middle peasants, work together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and use the sweat of labor to wash away the dirty things in the minds of intellectuals, and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life."

	Since then, Pei Huaxia has regularly participated in collective production labor with the commune members, and the more she works, the more enthusiastic she becomes. The students said, "We should learn from Teacher Pei. She is our good example."

　　“你是我的好老师”
    今年十月的一天，辽宁省辽阳市黄泥洼公社代耳湾大队三队的稻田里，有一个年青的女同志，和贫下中农一起脚踏稀泥，挥动着镰刀割稻子，干的满身是汗，身上溅满了泥点。她是代耳湾小学教师虞配华。贫下中农赞扬说：“虞老师真变了，丢掉了‘三白’，换上了红心，这样的教师，咱贫下中农信得过。”
    原来，虞配华经常穿白色的鞋，扎白色的头绳，脖子上围着白纱巾，因此，有的社员说她是“三白教师”。今年春天，学校放了农忙假，虞配华和社员一起插稻秧。社员干的热火朝天，她却在后边轻手轻脚地干活，不敢靠拢社员，生怕泥水溅到身上，弄脏了衣服。贫下中农对她这种举动很有意见。老贫农黄锦喜更是看不惯，总想给学校提出来。可是，当时学校不归贫下中农管，就把这事撂下了。
    今年五月，代耳湾大队贫下中农把学校管理起来了。老贫农黄锦喜也参加了管理。有一天晚上，他翻来复去睡不着，总想着管理学校的事，忽然想起了虞配华。他想：“老师本身怕脏怕累，贪图轻闲，不热爱劳动，这怎么能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人呢？不行！我们贫下中农管理学校，不能眼瞅着老师顺着邪路走下去。把师生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，这是咱贫下中农义不容辞的责任。”
    第二天，黄锦喜来到学校，找虞配华谈心。黄锦喜开场就问：“小虞啊！‘劳动光荣’这四个字你懂得不懂得？”虞配华说：“懂得。”“那你说一说你参加劳动的体会吧。”“啊……啊……”虞配华说不出来。这时，黄锦喜亲切地说：“你看，那一样东西不是劳动人民创造出来的，布是工人织的，粮食是农民种的。为了中国革命和世界革命，咱贫下中农努力争取多打粮食，整天地劳动着，虽然累一些，可心里有说不出的高兴。当教师的不热爱劳动，那怎么能教好学生？要想革命，就得劳动，忘了劳动，就是忘了革命，会滑到修正主义的泥坑里去的。”虞配华听着，听着，越听心里越亮堂，更加痛恨刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。她深深感到贫下中农是自己最好的老师。于是，她恳切地对黄锦喜说：“你是我的好老师，从今天起，我一定当好贫下中农的小学生，和贫下中农劳动在一起，用劳动的汗水冲掉知识分子头脑里的肮脏东西，为贫下中农服务一辈子。”
    打这以后，虞配华就定期和社员一起参加集体生产劳动，越干越带劲。学生们说：“我们要向虞老师学习，她是咱们的好榜样。”
