Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Deeply Love Great Leader Chairman Mao
The poor and lower-middle peasants of Chengguan Commune, Guangze County, Fujian Province, while studying the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, have linked the commune's two-year struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the great achievements of Chairman Mao, the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They love Chairman Mao even more and have launched a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, while working hard in the fields during the autumn harvest, transporting grain for the country, and in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and groups of the production brigades, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants attribute every victory they have achieved to the wise leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao and to the great victories of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say that when the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were just ignited, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, with the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi at their head, pushed the reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue, demoting a large number of revolutionary leading cadres. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued the battle cry of "Bombard the Headquarters" and personally presided over the drafting of the "Sixteen Points," dispersing the clouds and fog and pointing out the direction of victory for us. When the capitalist-roaders stirred up the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, attempting to sabotage the rural cultural revolution, it was Chairman Mao who issued the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," leading the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to smash this evil wind and bring about a new situation in the commune's revolution and production. When the capitalist-roaders within the Party provoked the masses to fight against each other, Great Leader Chairman Mao personally inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions and made extremely important instructions. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to necessarily split into two diametrically opposed factions." The two factions of revolutionary masses in the commune seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity, exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders and then establishing the revolutionary committee, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A ship sailing on the sea needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Chengguan Commune say that with Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat demons and monsters and transform barren mountains and bad lands. We poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow Chairman Mao and march in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Old poor peasant Jiang Taixian, who had been a long-term laborer for a landlord for eighteen years in the old society, said excitedly while studying the communiqué: "The communiqué speaks to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The more we read it, the more we feel that our parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao, and the more we read it, the more we hate the great traitor Liu Shaoqi." With deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao, they extensively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The entire commune of over 3,300 households all have "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles," and every household has hung a portrait of Great Leader Chairman Mao. The brigades and production teams have all established Mao Zedong Thought study classes or groups, and the vast majority of commune members have participated in the study classes. The Chongrui Brigade, located in a mountainous area, had over a hundred women who rarely participated in labor in the past. In the study classes, they seriously studied the communiqué and, based on the tasks proposed in the communiqué, repeatedly studied Great Leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "uniting to participate in production and political activities, improving women's economic and political status." They actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and actively participated in the autumn harvest labor.

　　贫下中农无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    福建光泽县城关公社贫下中农联系两年来文化大革命的战斗历程，热烈赞颂毛泽东思想的无比威力，更加爱读毛主席的书
    据新华社福州十五日电　福建省光泽县城关公社广大贫下中农认真学习十二中全会公报的同时，联系本公社两年来文化大革命的战斗历程，热烈赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，热烈赞颂毛泽东思想的无比威力，热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。
    连日来，在紧张劳动的“三秋”田野里，在运送爱国粮的大路上，在生产队的毛泽东思想学习班和学习小组里，广大贫下中农把自己所取得的每一个胜利，都看成是伟大领袖毛主席英明领导的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们说，当无产阶级文化大革命的烈火刚刚点燃的时候，以叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇为首的党内一小撮走资派在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命领导干部打了下去，在这个关键时刻，毛主席发出了《炮打司令部》的战斗号召，亲自主持制订了《十六条》，驱散了乌云迷雾，为我们指出了胜利的航向；当走资派刮起反革命经济主义妖风，妄图破坏农村文化大革命的时候，又是毛主席发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，领导无产阶级革命派击溃这股妖风，使公社革命、生产出现了崭新局面；当党内走资派挑起群众斗群众的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席又亲自视察了华北、中南、华东地区，作了极为重要的指示。毛主席指出：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”公社两派革命群众组织认真学习了毛主席这一指示，很快实现了革命大联合，把一小撮走资派揪了出来，接着又建立了革委会，取得了文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。城关公社的贫下中农说，有了毛泽东思想，妖魔鬼怪能战胜，穷山恶水能变样。我们贫下中农要永生永世紧跟毛主席，朝着毛主席指引的方向走到底。在旧社会给地主当过十八年长工的老贫农江太贤，在学习公报时激动地说：公报句句话都说到我们贫下中农的心坎里，越读越感到爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，越读越感到大叛徒刘少奇最可恨。他们带着千仇万恨，用毛泽东思想这个无比锐利的武器，在田头，在晒谷场上开展革命大批判。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，大学大用毛泽东思想。全公社三千三百多户普遍有《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，家家户户都张贴了伟大领袖毛主席的画像，大队、生产队全部办起了毛泽东思想学习班或学习小组，绝大多数社员都参加了学习班。地处山区的崇瑞大队，过去很少参加劳动的一百多个妇女，在学习班里认真学习公报，并根据公报提出的任务，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位”的教导，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，积极参加“三秋”劳动。
