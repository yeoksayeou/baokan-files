	Meanwhile, workers in the central Italian cities of Ancona, and in the northern cities of Udine and Pordenone also went on general strikes. On November 9th, workers in the southern city of Potenza and the central city of Ascoli Piceno went on a general strike, paralyzing these provinces and cities.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on November 11th: The struggle of students across Italy against the decadent capitalist education system and the persecution by the Italian ruling class is intensifying.
