"Go Back, Russians!" "We Drove Away Hitler, We Will Drive Away Brezhnev!"

Czech People Hold Massive Protest Against Soviet Military Occupation

Protesters bravely broke through multiple police barriers and marched towards the Prague Castle, where the Czech revisionist leaders' offices are located. Soviet diplomats were terrified by the protesters and fled through the back door.

New China News Agency, November 3rd: Prague News: Despite the armed suppression by the Soviet occupation forces and the Czech revisionist traitor clique, the people of Czechoslovakia held a massive protest march on October 28th in Prague against the long-term military occupation by the Soviet revisionists.

According to reports, thousands of young students, workers, and citizens in Prague held up banners and flags with slogans such as "We will never yield," "We want freedom, not Russian slavery," and marched through the central area of Wenceslas Square. The marchers sang as they advanced, and more people joined the protest along the way. By the time they reached Old Town Square, the number of protesters had swelled to over ten thousand. They held a protest rally in the square against the long-term occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet military. The atmosphere was heated, and people shouted slogans in anger: "Go Back, Russians!" "Moscow—Munich!" "Hitler—Brezhnev!" "You have tanks, we have truth!" "Tanks cannot silence us!" The protesters also observed a moment of silence in memory of those killed by the Soviet occupation forces.

The panicked Soviet occupation forces and the Czech revisionist traitor clique dispatched troops and a large number of police to monitor the protesters' march. The Czech revisionist clique also sent one police car after another to block the roads, attempting to stop the protesters from advancing. However, the enraged protesters bravely broke through the multiple barriers set up by the police and marched towards the Prague Castle, where the Czech revisionist leaders' offices are located. At that time, Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Chervonenko, who was attending a celebration hosted by the Czech revisionist leaders in the Prague Castle, was terrified by the protesters' strong resistance and hurriedly fled through the side door of the Prague Castle. When the protesters marched to the National Theatre and shouted slogans against the Soviet occupation, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov, who was watching a performance in the theatre, was also frightened and fled through the back door.

The protesters also bravely marched towards the Soviet Embassy in Czechoslovakia. The Czech authorities were on high alert, setting up one blockade after another at each street leading to the embassy, and even using fire trucks to threaten the crowd with water cannons. They even brutally beat and arrested protesters. Despite the Czech authorities' threats and suppression, the protesters were fearless. They shouted towards the Soviet Embassy: "Go Back, Russians!" "We drove away Hitler, we will drive away Brezhnev!"

The entire protest march lasted for more than ten hours.

On the same day, people in Bratislava also held a protest.

This protest march by the people of Czechoslovakia once again expressed their great indignation towards the Soviet military occupation and the Czech revisionists' capitulation. Since October 16th, when the Soviet revisionists, with the tacit approval and support of the U.S. imperialists, signed a treaty with the Czech revisionists to long-term occupy Czechoslovakia, the people of Czechoslovakia have launched a new wave of large-scale protests. They have gone on strike, boycotted classes, held protest rallies, and collected signatures to expose the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionists' long-term occupation of Czechoslovakia.

The Czech revisionist traitor clique is terrified of the people's resistance. They fear that the people will launch a large-scale struggle against the Soviet revisionists and their own betrayal, threatening the people not to hold rallies or marches and intimidating young students that they will be expelled if they participate in the marches. The Soviet occupation forces also threatened, "We will bring the tanks back into the city" to intimidate the people of Czechoslovakia.

However, the threats and intimidation by the Czech revisionist traitor clique and the Soviet occupation forces cannot frighten the revolutionary people of Czechoslovakia, nor can they stop their brave struggle. The people's protest in Prague on October 28th once again demonstrated the fighting spirit of the people of Czechoslovakia.

    “俄国佬滚回去！”“我们赶走了希特勒，我们也一定赶走勃列日涅夫！”
    捷人民大示威反对苏修军事占领
    示威群众英勇冲破警察设置的重重障碍，冲向捷修头目办公地布拉格宫，苏修外交官员被示威群众吓破了胆，从后门溜跑
    新华社三日讯　布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克人民不顾苏修占领军和捷修叛徒集团的武装镇压，十月二十八日，在布拉格举行了声势浩大的反对苏修长期军事占领的游行示威。
    据报道，数以千计的布拉格青年学生、工人和市民高举“宁死不屈”、“我们要自由，不要俄国的奴役”等标语和旗帜，在布拉格市中心区的瓦茨拉夫大街，举行了游行示威。游行队伍高歌挺进，沿途群众纷纷参加示威行列，在到达老城广场时，示威群众已达一万多人。他们在广场上举行了反对苏修军队长期占领捷克斯洛伐克的抗议大会。会上，群情激昂，人们愤怒地高呼口号：“俄国佬滚回去！”“莫斯科—慕尼黑！”“希特勒—勃列日涅夫！”“你们有坦克，我们有真理！”“坦克不能使我们沉默！”示威群众还以沉痛的心情，为被苏修占领军杀害的群众默念致哀。
    惊慌失措的苏修占领军和捷修叛徒集团，出动军队和大批警察监视群众的示威游行。捷修集团还开出一辆又一辆的警车挡住道路，妄图阻止示威群众前进。但是，怒不可遏的示威群众英勇地冲破警察设置的重重障碍，冲向捷修头目办公的地点布拉格宫。这时正在布拉格宫参加捷修头目举行的庆祝会的苏修驻捷大使契尔沃年科，被示威群众的强大斗争吓破了胆，慌忙从布拉格宫的边门溜走。当示威的群众游行到民族剧院前，愤怒地高呼反对苏修占领的口号时，正在剧院看戏的苏修外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫也被吓得从后门溜跑了。
    示威群众还藐视苏修占领军的镇压，英勇地冲向苏修驻捷大使馆。捷修当局如临大敌，在通向大使馆的各个街口，布置了一道又一道的封锁线，并出动救火车，用水龙头威吓群众，甚至野蛮地殴打和逮捕示威群众。面对捷修当局的威吓和镇压，示威者毫不畏惧，他们向着苏修大使馆高呼：“俄国佬滚回去！”“我们赶走了希特勒，我们也一定赶走勃列日涅夫！”
    整个示威游行持续了十几个小时。
    同一天，布拉迪斯拉发市的群众也举行了示威。
    这次捷克斯洛伐克人民举行的示威游行，再一次表达了捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏修军事占领和对捷修屈膝投降的极大愤慨。自从十月十六日苏修在美帝的默契和支持下和捷修签订苏修侵略军长期占领捷克斯洛伐克的条约以来，捷克斯洛伐克人民展开了新的大规模的抗议活动，他们以罢工、罢课、举行抗议集会和征集签名等各种方式，揭露苏修长期霸占捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行。
    捷修叛徒集团对人民的反抗怕得要死，他们害怕人民爆发大规模的反对苏修和他们自己的背叛行为的群众斗争，威胁群众不许举行集会游行，恫吓青年学生，如果参加游行就要开除学籍。苏修占领军则叫嚣“将把坦克重新开进城市”来威胁捷克斯洛伐克人民。
    但是，捷修叛徒集团和苏修占领军的威胁恫吓吓不倒富有革命传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民，也阻挡不了他们的英勇斗争。十月二十八日在布拉格举行的群众示威又一次显示了捷克斯洛伐克人民的战斗精神。
