Japanese friends recently made statements, enthusiastically hailing the issuance of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The director of the "Mao Zedong Thought Institute" in Japan, Otuka Yuzō, pointed out that the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee once again proved that the great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible.

Otuka said, the communiqué is a great call to arms. It has brought great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the whole world, and it is a heavy blow to the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique.

Otuka said, the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee is a declaration. It proclaims that the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi has been thoroughly smashed.

Otuka also emphasized that the communiqué has given us great lessons. It makes us clearly understand how to grasp Chairman Mao's instructions on party building. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy."

Otuka said, Japanese revolutionaries who are fighting against the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, the Soviet revisionists, and the Japanese revisionist clique are all excited by the issuance of the communiqué. He finally shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Two years ago, Ishida Itsuro, a friend from Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, who fought against the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Miyamoto, said, revolutionary people of all countries in the world are happy about the success of this plenary session, while only a small handful of American imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, Miyamoto revisionist cliques, and reactionaries of various countries are terrified.

Ishida said, the seven hundred million Chinese people have overthrown the number one capitalist-roader and great traitor Liu Shaoqi in this struggle, which is truly heartening.

He stressed that the practice of struggle has proved that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and Chairman Mao's series of instructions in various periods of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are all correct.

He expressed that as long as the Japanese people seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese revolution will definitely be victorious.

Ishida finally shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

　　日本朋友赞扬中共八届十二中全会公报是伟大的号角
　　伟大的毛泽东思想战无不胜
　　七亿中国人民打倒了头号走资派、大叛徒刘少奇真是大快人心
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本朋友最近发表谈话，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表。
    日本“毛泽东思想学院”院长大塚有章指出，八届十二中全会公报又一次证明了伟大的毛泽东思想是战无不胜的。
    大塚说，公报是伟大的号角，它给全世界革命人民带来了莫大的鼓舞，而对以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者是一个沉重的打击。
    大塚说，八届十二中全会的公报是宣言书。它宣告以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部已经彻底地被摧毁。
    大塚还强调指出，公报给了我们很大的教益，它使我们明确地认识到怎样才能把毛主席关于建党问题的指示学到手。毛主席教导我们说：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”
    大塚说，正在同美日反动派、苏修和日修叛徒集团进行斗争的日本革命者无不为公报的发表感到欢欣鼓舞。他最后高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    两年前大造了日共宫本修正主义集团反的大阪府堺市的日本朋友石田逸夫说，世界各国革命人民都对这一次全会的成功感到高兴，而感到恐惧的只是一小撮美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、宫本修正主义集团和各国反动派。
    石田说，七亿中国人民在这一场斗争中打倒了头号走资派、大叛徒刘少奇，真是大快人心。
    他强调指出，斗争实践证明，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的战略部署和毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中的各个时期所作的一系列指示，都是正确的。
    他表示，日本人民只要认真学习和运用毛泽东思想，日本革命就一定会胜利。
    石田最后高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
