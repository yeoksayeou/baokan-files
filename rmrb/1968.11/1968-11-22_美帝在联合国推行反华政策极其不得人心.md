The U.S. imperialists' policy of opposing China at the United Nations is extremely unpopular. The proposal by Albania and other countries to restore China's legitimate rights at the United Nations reflects the ardent wishes of the broad masses of the world's people. The U.S. imperialists' manipulation of the voting machine to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights only exposes their fear of a powerful socialist China.

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: Our correspondent reports: The 23rd session of the United Nations General Assembly held discussions on the so-called "Chinese representation issue" from the 11th to the 19th of this month. The fact that the United Nations year after year discusses this "issue" clearly shows that despite the repeated manipulation of the voting machine by the U.S. imperialists, who insist on opposing the Chinese people, to keep the legitimate representatives of 700 million Chinese people out of the United Nations, they can never stifle the increasingly strong demands of the peoples of various countries for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights. The U.S. imperialists' reactionary policy of hostility towards China is extremely unpopular, and their position on this issue is extremely isolated.

This round of "debate" was held at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the world, has achieved great and decisive victories. The U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries, who are terrified by the great revolutionary movement of the Chinese people, have mobilized all their propaganda machines to continuously engage in the most frantic and shameless slander against the great Chinese people. However, lies can never cover up the sunlight of truth. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has won the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary people of the whole world, and the international prestige of New China is growing day by day. Amidst the curses of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, the number of countries initiating the proposal to demand the restoration of China's legitimate rights at the United Nations this year has increased by five compared to last year.

The proposal initiated by Albania, Algeria, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Cuba, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Tanzania, Romania, Sudan, Syria, South Yemen, and Zambia calls for recognizing the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people, restoring all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and expelling the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from all United Nations organizations. This proposal reflects the ardent wishes of the broad masses of the world's people.

Albanian representative Halim Budo exposed at the meeting with ironclad facts the various crimes of the U.S.-Soviet collusion in opposing China and revolution, and refuted the various shameless anti-China fabrications of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. He pointed out that the main target of the U.S.-Soviet collusion is China, because China is the strongest and insurmountable obstacle on the road to their evil plan of world hegemony, and China is a strong bastion defending the freedom of the peoples of various countries, defending the struggle of the peoples of various countries against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism, and for liberation. Budo enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction, praised China's consistent adherence to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and its policy of peace, friendship, and good neighborliness, and its resolute opposition to the aggressive and war policies of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Budo emphasized that only the Government of the People's Republic of China has the right to enjoy China's legitimate rights in the United Nations organization.

Many representatives of Asian and African countries also spoke in the "debate," condemning the U.S. imperialists for supporting the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, who have been spat upon by the Chinese people, to occupy China's seat in the United Nations, and for keeping the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people out of the United Nations for a long time. They opposed the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas."

Pakistani representative Agha Shahi pointed out that the proposal by Albania and other countries "is based on an unmistakable reality, that is, there is only one China, and the only government that can legitimately represent China in all United Nations organizations is the Government of the People's Republic of China." He emphasized that Pakistan absolutely rejects the "two Chinas" proposition.

Nepalese representative P.B. Khatri, in his speech, praised China's positive role in Asian peace. He cited the friendly relations between Nepal and China as an example, pointing out that these relations "are firmly based on the principles of good neighborliness, peaceful coexistence, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference."

Tanzanian representative Danieli condemned the United States for using a "delaying strategy" to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights. He said that the United States must be held responsible for this and should be condemned. He also pointed out, in response to the United States' insistence that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits should "represent China," that Taiwan is a province of China and is currently completely under U.S. military occupation.

Congolese (Brazzaville) representative Ongaga also pointed out in his speech that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have no right to represent the Chinese people. He said that Taiwan has already become a colony of the United States, and Chiang Kai-shek is merely a puppet who has long been spat upon by the Chinese people and is now "protected" by the United States. Ongaga also praised China's selfless aid to Asian and African countries in his speech.

Guinean representative Diallo emphasized, in response to some slanders against China and deliberate attempts to sow discord between Asian and African countries and China, that Guinea is pleased with its bilateral relations with China and appreciates China's aid to Asian and African countries and its respect for Asian and African countries.

Zambian representative Mwanga, in expressing his support for the demand to restore China's legitimate rights, emphasized that the People's Republic of China is a peace-loving country, and without China's participation, no major international issue of the day can be resolved. He also said that the claim that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits can "represent China" is "pure nonsense."

Facing the stern condemnation and demands of world public opinion, the U.S. imperialists once again played their usual trick on this issue, rallying Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and more than ten other countries that are willing to act as their anti-China "henchmen" and lackeys, to propose a "resolution" to treat the restoration of China's legitimate representation, which can usually be decided by a simple majority, as a so-called "important issue" that requires a two-thirds majority to pass. Their arrogant and domineering actions once again faced widespread opposition at the meeting. Many representatives of Asian and African countries pointed out in their speeches that the "reasons" put forward by the United States are completely untenable and are deliberately delaying the resolution of this issue.

Due to the increasing unpopularity of the U.S. imperialists' trick, they instructed Italy, Belgium, and five other countries to once again throw out the old and repeatedly failed "resolution" to establish a "committee" to "study" the "Chinese representation issue" as a "second line of defense" to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights, while also preparing public opinion for the U.S. imperialists' open plot to create "two Chinas." Belgian representative Schurmanns, in a letter publicly distributed at the United Nations, inadvertently revealed the bottom line of the U.S. imperialists' concoction of such a "resolution." In the letter, he admitted that Belgium's participation in the initiation of such a "resolution" was "considering" a "solution" of "two Chinas." As in the previous two years, this "resolution" was exposed and condemned by many representatives of countries upholding justice, who pointed out that such a scheme serving the plot to create "two Chinas" is unacceptable.

The representatives of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique played a very unseemly two-faced role in this "debate." On the 13th meeting, Soviet representative Malik, on the one hand, pretended to "support" the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and expressed "opposition" to the "two Chinas" proposition. However, immediately afterward, he equated the "restoration" of the "Chinese representation issue" with the issue of admitting two Germanys, blatantly serving the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas." Moreover, just before the General Assembly's "debate" on the "Chinese representation issue," the personnel of the Soviet revisionist clique also distributed anti-China propaganda materials at the United Nations, openly collaborating with the U.S. imperialists to create public opinion to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Thus, the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique was once again exposed in broad daylight.

As in previous years, the U.S. imperialists once again manipulated the voting machine at this meeting to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Such a vote does not harm the Chinese people, who are marching forward with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held high, but only exposes the U.S. imperialists' ferocious face of hostility towards the Chinese people, exposes their fear of a powerful socialist China that insists on an anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist stance, and also exposes the political and moral bankruptcy of this so-called "United Nations" organization, proving that the Chinese people's assessment of this so-called "international organization" is completely correct: it is merely a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression.

### 美帝在联合国推行反华政策极其不得人心

    美帝在联合国推行反华政策极其不得人心
    阿尔巴尼亚等国要求恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的提案反映世界广大人民热切愿望
    美帝开动表决机器阻挠恢复中国的合法权利只能暴露它对强大的社会主义中国的恐惧
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：第二十三届联合国大会从十一日到十九日再次就所谓“中国代表权问题”举行了“辩论”。联合国年复一年地讨论这个“问题”这一事实本身就清楚地说明，尽管坚持同中国人民为敌的美帝国主义一再开动表决机器把七亿中国人民的合法代表长期排斥在联合国之外，然而，它却永远无法窒息世界各国人民越来越强烈地要求恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利的正义呼声。美帝敌视中国的反动政策极其不得人心，它在这个问题上的处境极其孤立。
    这一次的“辩论”是在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大的、决定性的胜利的情况下举行的。被中国人民的这一伟大的革命运动吓破了胆的美帝国主义者、苏修叛徒集团和各国反动派，开动它们的全部宣传机器，对伟大的中国人民不断进行最疯狂无耻的诽谤。然而，谎言毕竟遮不住真理的阳光，中国的无产阶级文化大革命得到了全世界革命人民的热烈支持，新中国的国际威望与日俱增。在帝修反的一片诅咒声中，今年参加提出关于要求恢复中国在联合国的合法权利这一提案的发起国比去年又增加了五个国家。
    由阿尔巴尼亚、阿尔及利亚、柬埔寨、刚果（布）、古巴、几内亚、马里、毛里塔尼亚、巴基斯坦、坦桑尼亚、罗马尼亚、苏丹、叙利亚、南也门和赞比亚等国家提出的这项提案，要求承认中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一的合法代表，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的一切合法权利，并把蒋介石匪帮的“代表”从联合国的一切机构中驱逐出去。这一提案反映了世界广大人民的热切愿望。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表哈利姆·布多在会上以铁的事实揭露了美帝苏修勾结合伙反华、反革命的种种罪行，驳斥了帝修反的种种无耻反华谰言。他指出，美苏勾结的主要矛头是针对中国的，因为中国是它们实现称霸世界的恶毒计划道路上的一个最强大和不可逾越的障碍，中国是捍卫各国人民的自由，捍卫各国人民反帝、反殖、反修，争取解放的斗争的坚强堡垒。布多在讲话中热情赞扬中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中和社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就，赞扬中国一贯履行无产阶级国际主义原则，奉行和平、友好和睦邻政策，坚决反对美帝和苏修的侵略和战争政策。布多强调指出，只有中华人民共和国政府才有资格在联合国组织中享有中国的合法权利。
    许多亚非国家代表也在“辩论”中纷纷发言，谴责美帝扶植早已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石残余匪帮的“代表”盘踞中国在联合国的席位，而把中国人民的合法代表长期排斥在联合国之外的罪行，反对美帝策划“两个中国”的阴谋。
    巴基斯坦代表阿加·夏希指出，阿尔巴尼亚等国的提案“是以不容回避的现实情况为根据的，那就是，现在只有一个中国，唯一能合法地在联合国一切机构中代表中国的是中华人民共和国政府的代表”。他强调表示，巴基斯坦绝对拒绝“两个中国”的主张。
    尼泊尔代表帕·巴·卡特里在发言中赞扬了中国对于亚洲和平所起的积极作用。他以尼中两国的友好关系为例指出，这种关系“是牢固地建立在睦邻政策、和平共处五项原则和万隆宣言十大原则的基础上的”。
    坦桑尼亚代表丹尼利谴责美国用“拖延战略”来阻挠恢复中国合法权利。他说，美国必须对此负责，并应受到谴责。他还针对美国坚持应由蒋介石匪帮来“代表中国”的荒谬论点指出，台湾是中国的一个省，目前完全处于美国的军事占领之下。
    刚果（布）代表翁加古也在发言中指出，蒋介石匪帮根本无权代表中国人民。他说，台湾目前已经沦为美国的殖民地，而蒋介石只不过是早已为中国人民所唾弃、如今受美国“保护”的一个傀儡。翁加古在发言中还赞扬了中国对亚非国家的无私援助。
    几内亚代表迪亚洛针对一些诽谤中国、蓄意挑拨亚非国家同中国的友好关系的谰言强调指出，几内亚对于它同中国的双边关系感到高兴，并且对于中国援助亚非国家、尊重亚非国家的态度表示赞赏。
    赞比亚代表姆旺加在表示支持恢复中国合法权利的要求时强调指出，中华人民共和国是一个爱好和平的国家，如果没有中国的参加，当代任何重大国际问题一个也不可能得到解决，他还说，所谓蒋介石匪帮能“代表中国”的说法“纯粹是鬼话”。
    面对着世界公正舆论的严正谴责和要求，美帝国主义再次玩弄多年来它在这个问题上惯用的无赖手法，又一次纠集了日本、泰国、菲律宾等十多个甘心充当它反华“打手”的仆从、娄罗，提出了一项“提案”，硬要把恢复中国合法代表权这样一个照例只需要简单多数就能决定的问题，当作一个需要三分之二的多数才能通过的所谓“重要问题”来处理。它的这一蛮横霸道的作法又一次在会上遭到了广泛的反对，许多亚非国家的代表在发言中指出，美国提出的“理由”是完全站不住脚的，是蓄意拖延这个问题的解决。
    由于美帝的这一无赖手法越来越不得人心，它在这次“辩论”中指使意大利、比利时等五个国家重新抛出了那个一再碰壁的所谓建立一个“委员会”来“研究”“中国代表权问题”的“提案”，作为阻挠恢复中国合法权利的“第二道防线”，同时也为美帝公开制造“两个中国”的阴谋准备舆论。比利时代表舒尔曼斯在一封在联合国公开散发的信件当中，就不打自招地泄漏了美帝炮制这样一项“提案”的老底。他在信中承认，比利时参与发起这样一项“提案”，是“考虑”到“两个中国”那样一项“解决办法”的。同前两年一样，这个“提案”遭到了许多主持正义的国家的代表的揭露和谴责，他们指出，这种为制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务的方案是不可接受的。
    苏修叛徒集团的代表在这次“辩论”中又扮演了极不光彩的两面派角色。在十三日的会议上，苏联代表马立克一面装模作样地表示“支持”恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，表示“反对”“两个中国”的主张，然而紧接着，他又把“恢复”“中国代表权问题”同关于接纳两个德国的问题相提并论，明目张胆地为美帝推行“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。不仅如此，就在联大“辩论”“中国代表权问题”前夕，苏修集团的人员还在联合国大肆散发反华宣传材料，公开配合美帝为阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利制造舆论。这样，苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸再次暴露于光天化日之下。
    同往年一样，美帝在这次会上又一次开动了表决机器，阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。这种表决对于正在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗昂首阔步前进的中国人民毫无所损，而只能再次暴露美帝国主义仇视中国人民的狰狞面目，暴露出它对坚持反帝反修立场的强大的社会主义中国的恐惧，同时也暴露出这个所谓的“联合国”组织在政治上、道义上的破产，证明中国人民对于这个所谓的“国际组织”的估价是完全正确的：它只不过是美帝国主义的一个侵略工具。
