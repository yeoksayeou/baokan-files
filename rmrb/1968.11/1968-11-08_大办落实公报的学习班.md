The students of the May 7th Cadres School in Liuhe have launched a movement to study, publicize, and implement the communiqué, determined to make the May 7th Cadres School even better.

The revolutionary committee of the Niuxintai Coal Mine in Liaoning Province, with the greatest enthusiasm, has gone deep into the production front lines and worked with the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 7th: The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, which has great historical significance, has greatly inspired the cadres studying at the May 7th Cadres School in Liuhe, Heilongjiang Province, who are on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements. A mass movement to study the communiqué, publicize it, and implement the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session is surging forward across the school.

The students of the May 7th Cadres School, who are advancing along the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, immediately launched activities to praise Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on the night the communiqué was issued. They also beat drums and gongs through the night, carrying the full text of the communiqué they had just transcribed, to nearby production teams to publicize it. Now, the school has universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the main content being the study of the communiqué and the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the plenary session. Starting from late October, the school's revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "sum up achievements, rectify errors, and prepare for future battles," launched a rectification movement across the school. The issuance of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum has pointed the way for them to carry out this rectification movement. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the students, in light of the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, reviewed the work of the school since its establishment, determined to build on achievements, overcome shortcomings, and better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They will further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center" theory, carry out revolutionary criticism more broadly and deeply, do a good job in cleaning up class ranks and party rectification and building, seriously accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly transform their worldviews to make the May 7th Cadres School even better.

Inspired by the communiqué, a new high tide of revolutionary criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi is surging across the school. In recent days, the students have taken the fields, farmlands, and dormitories as their battlefields to thoroughly criticize the entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi. Through revolutionary criticism, the students have greatly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, determined to break completely with all old traditions and old ideas, and with the idea of being an official and a lord. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they will be both "officials" and common people. The revolutionary committee of the school has decided to continue organizing the students in batches to go to factories, rural production teams, and PLA companies to seriously accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

With even higher morale, the students of the school have thrown themselves into a new production high tide. Not long ago, more than a hundred new students who entered the May 7th Cadres School were inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and voluntarily took on the arduous task of developing a vast wilderness. The day after they heard the communiqué, they carried Chairman Mao's Little Red Book, took an oath before Chairman Mao's portrait, and set out on a long march to create the fourth battle zone of the May 7th Cadres School—the Dongfanghong Battle Zone.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 6th: The military representatives and members of the revolutionary committee of the Niuxintai Coal Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province, with the greatest political enthusiasm, have gone deep into the ranks of the workers, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the production front lines. They are seriously studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and resolutely implementing the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The revolutionary committee of the Niuxintai Coal Mine is a unit that has achieved great success in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and in the struggle, criticism, and transformation work. The revolutionary committee of Benxi City once held a conference here to promote their advanced experience. As soon as the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the military representatives and other members of the revolutionary committee took the communiqué and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the production front lines and held study classes to implement the communiqué with the broad revolutionary workers. In the study classes, the members of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary workers, using the communiqué as a textbook, linked it with the mine's two years of struggle practice, enthusiastically discussing the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; using the communiqué as a mirror, they combined it with the actual struggle, criticism, and transformation of their unit, carrying out activities to "identify problems and find gaps," and formulated measures to further improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They adopted the approach of studying, fighting, and implementing simultaneously, further igniting a revolutionary criticism movement across the mine. The more they criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, the deeper their hatred grew, and the deeper their understanding of Chairman Mao's great instruction that "this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Across the mine, a new high tide of further strengthening the revolutionary nature of the leading cadre group and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation has surged forward. While studying the communiqué, they have, on the basis of streamlining, abolished thirteen intermediate departments, adopting a direct leadership method, sending a large number of department personnel to the grassroots level to work with the workers. The nine standing committee members of the revolutionary committee, except for leaving two to take turns on duty, have all gone to the front lines to grasp revolution and promote production with the workers. They have also reformed the grassroots labor organization, dividing coal miners of the same type into three companies, with leading cadres insisting on working in shifts and working on the front lines. This approach has been warmly praised by the broad revolutionary staff of the mine.

    大办落实公报的学习班
    柳河“五·七”干校学员掀起学习公报、宣传公报、落实公报的运动，决心把“五·七”干校办得更好
    牛心台煤矿革委会以最大热情，深入生产第一线和群众一起开展革命大批判，推动斗批改深入发展
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十二中全会公报，极大地鼓舞了战斗在三大革命运动第一线的黑龙江柳河“五·七”干校的学员。一个学习公报、宣传公报、落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的群众运动，正在全校蓬勃兴起。
    沿着毛主席光辉“五·七”指示阔步前进的“五·七”干校的学员们，公报发表的当天晚上就立即开展了颂扬毛主席革命路线的活动，并连夜敲锣打鼓，拿着刚刚记录下来的公报全文，到附近生产队去宣传。现在，全校普遍办起了以学习公报和落实全会提出的各项任务为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。从十月下旬开始，干校革命委员会就遵照毛主席“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的教导，在全校开展了一次整风运动。十二中全会公报的发表，给他们开展这次整风运动指明了方向。学员们在毛泽东思想学习班上对照公报所提出的各项战斗任务，检查干校创办以来的工作，决心发扬成绩，克服缺点，更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，更广泛、更深入地开展革命大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作和整党、建党工作，认真接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造自己的世界观，把“五·七”干校办得更好。
    在公报的鼓舞下，一个对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判的新高潮正在全校开展起来。连日来，学员们以田间、地头、宿舍为战场，彻底批判刘少奇所推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线。学员们通过革命大批判，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，决心和一切旧传统、旧观念彻底决裂，和做官当老爷的观念彻底决裂，遵照毛主席的教导，既当“官”，又当老百姓。干校革命委员会决定继续分期分批组织学员到工厂去，到农村生产队和解放军连队去，认真接受工农兵的再教育。
    干校的学员们以更加高昂的斗志，投入了新的生产高潮中。不久前到“五·七”干校入学的一百多名新学员，在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，主动要求承担开发一片大荒原的艰巨任务。他们在听到公报后的第二天早晨，就身带毛主席的红色宝书，在毛主席像前宣誓以后，出发远征，去开创“五·七”干校的第四个战区——东方红战区。
    据新华社沈阳六日电辽宁省本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿革命委员会军队代表和革委会成员，以最大的政治热情，深入到工人群众中去，在生产第一线举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，坚决贯彻执行全会提出的各项伟大的战斗任务，推动斗、批、改深入发展。
    牛心台煤矿革委会是一个紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在斗、批、改工作中取得了很大成绩的单位。本溪市革委会曾在这里召开过现场会，推广他们的先进经验。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报一发表，这个矿革委会的军队代表和革委会其他成员，就带着公报和毛主席最新指示深入到生产第一线，和广大革命工人一起举办了落实公报的学习班。在学习班里，革委会成员和革命工人以公报为教材，联系本矿两年来的斗争实践，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利；以公报为镜子，结合本单位斗、批、改的实际，开展了“摆问题，找差距”的活动，订出了进一步搞好斗、批、改的措施。他们采取边学习边战斗边落实的做法，在全矿进一步掀起了革命大批判的热潮。大家越批对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇仇恨越深，对毛主席关于“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”的伟大教导，理解越深。全矿上下，立即掀起了一个进一步加强领导班子革命化和认真搞好斗、批、改的新高潮。他们一面学习公报，一面在原来精简的基础上，又把十三个中层科室全部取消，采取一竿子插到底的领导方法，把大批科室人员充实到基层，和工人一起劳动。革委会九名常委，除留两名轮流值班外，其他全部到第一线和工人一起抓革命促生产，并且改革了基层劳动组织，把同工种的采煤工人分别编到三个连队里，领导干部坚持跟班作业，在第一线办公。这样做的结果，受到了全矿广大革命职工的热烈赞扬。
