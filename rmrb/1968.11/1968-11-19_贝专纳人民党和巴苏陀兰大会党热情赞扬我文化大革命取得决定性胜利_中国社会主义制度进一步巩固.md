The Botswana People's Party and the Basutoland Congress Party Warmly Praise the Decisive Victory of Our Cultural Revolution
Chinese Socialist System Further Consolidated

CAIRO, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana People's Party representative in Cairo, Bobbi Mark, and the Basutoland Congress Party's acting representative in Cairo, Hara, recently issued statements warmly welcoming the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th plenary session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They enthusiastically praised the great and decisive victory achieved by the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

In a statement issued on Nov. 12, Bobbi Mark said: "The plenary session, chaired by Chairman Mao Zedong, has great historical significance for the Chinese people and for revolutionaries and peoples around the world who are fighting against imperialism. This is a great contribution to the entire anti-imperialist struggle and a great inspiration to the peoples who are striving for genuine national independence and freedom. It also marks the great and decisive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

The statement said: "We also welcome the resolution of the plenary session to expel Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader within the party, traitor, spy, scab, imperialist and modern revisionist stooge, from the party forever. This clearly shows that all reactionaries and imperialist and modern revisionist stooges will meet the same fate as their accomplice Liu Shaoqi."

The statement pointed out: "Revolutionary peoples of all countries are jubilant over the success of the plenary session. They welcome the communiqué of the plenary session. The imperialists, modern revisionists and reactionaries of all countries, however, are terrified by the plenary session and its communiqué."

The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

In a statement issued on Nov. 17, Hara said that the plenary session chaired by the great leader Chairman Mao marked the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. "The victories achieved by China have international significance; these victories are not only China's but also belong to all oppressed and exploited peoples of the world."

The statement said that the proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has effectively swept away and eliminated a handful of reactionaries obstructing China's socialist path, further consolidating China's socialist system. At present, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese people has been raised, and everyone is aware of their responsibility to consolidate socialism. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," the Chinese people are striving to accelerate the construction of their motherland and have achieved great victories in production. All these are heavy blows to imperialism led by the United States.

The statement pointed out that exposing Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, who pose as socialists but are actually capitalist roaders and counter-revolutionaries, is a brilliant victory of the Chinese people in the proletarian cultural revolution. The statement said: "We welcome the resolution of the plenary session to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, to remove all his party and state positions, and to continue to expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices."

The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people!"

　　中国社会主义制度进一步巩固
    新华社开罗十七日电　贝专纳人民党驻开罗代表波比·马克和巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代理代表哈拉，最近分别发表声明，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表，热情赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。
    波比·马克十二日发表的声明说：“由毛泽东主席主持的这次全会，对中国人民以及正在同帝国主义作斗争的世界各国革命者和人民来说，都具有重大的历史意义。这是对整个反帝斗争作出的巨大贡献，是对正在从事争取真正的民族独立和自由的人民的巨大鼓舞。这也标志着无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
    声明说：“我们还欢呼全会作出的把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、叛徒、内奸、工贼、帝国主义和现代修正主义的走狗刘少奇永远开除出党的决议。这清楚地表明，一切反动派以及帝国主义和现代修正主义的走狗都会象它们的同伙刘少奇那样，决没有好下场。”
    声明指出：“各国革命人民为全会的成功感到欢欣鼓舞。他们欢呼全会公报，欢迎全会公报。而帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派则对全会及其公报怕得要死。”
    声明最后高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
    哈拉十七日发表的声明说，由伟大领袖毛主席主持的这次会议，标志着中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。“中国取得的胜利具有国际意义；这些胜利不仅是中国的，也是全世界一切被压迫人民和被剥削人民的。”
    声明说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，卓有成效地扫除和清除了一小撮阻碍中国走社会主义道路的反动分子，进一步巩固了中国的社会主义制度。目前，在中国全国除台湾省外，二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会。中国人民的革命觉悟提高了，每个人都意识到他对巩固社会主义所承担的义务。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，中国人民正在努力加速祖国的建设，生产上取得了伟大的胜利。所有这些，都是对以美国为首的帝国主义的沉重打击。
    声明指出，把刘少奇及其同伙这些冒充社会主义者而实际上是走资派和反革命分子的家伙揭露出来，这是中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的辉煌胜利。声明说：“我们欢呼全会通过决议，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙的反革命罪行。”
    声明最后高呼：“中国共产党万岁！中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
