The good news reached Hua Jia Di production brigade in the suburbs of Beijing on the night of November 1st. The news was that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had been convened and that Liu Shaoqi, a traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, had been permanently expelled from the Party.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hua Jia Di production brigade gathered under the loudspeaker. Many of them had tears of excitement rolling down their faces. Among them were Liu Qiming, the head of the brigade's revolutionary leading group, and Yan Delong, a 67-year-old poor peasant and head of the brigade's representative assembly. For over two years, they had led the revolutionary masses in a fierce struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his local agents. Now that Liu Shaoqi had been overthrown, how could they not be excited? They listened attentively and took notes word for word. They felt that every word and sentence in the communiqué was of great significance, forged in the struggle led by Chairman Mao and the broad masses of revolutionary cadres. They wanted to engrave every word in their hearts.

After listening to the broadcast, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hua Jia Di could no longer contain their excitement. They picked up their suonas and blew into the clear night sky. They beat drums, struck gongs, and set off firecrackers, celebrating this great victory. The workers from the nearby Shuinuo Factory formed neat lines, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and large characters of joy, coming to congratulate the poor and lower-middle peasants. Workers and peasants gathered in the brigade's courtyard, chatting and singing enthusiastically.

Poor peasant Liu Qiming said: In the past, Liu Shaoqi and his gang, including Peng Zhen and Liu Ren, colluded with the local landlords, rich peasants, and remnants of the Kuomintang, promoting "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency" and "material incentives," destroying Hua Jia Di production brigade. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hua Jia Di have taken back the leadership power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders and overthrown their rule. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and achieved double victories in revolution and production. Poor peasant Yan Delong said happily: "Chairman Mao saved us, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hua Jia Di, from a life of begging. Liu Shaoqi and his gang of bad guys tried to make us suffer again. Expelling Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently is the wish of us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants!"

As the night deepened, Liu Qiming led everyone in taking an oath before the portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants: "We will definitely study your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will follow you and revolutionize for life!" They unanimously wished Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

    喜讯传到了花家地
    “党的第八届扩大的十二中全会召开了”，“把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼永远开除出党了”。十一月一日夜晚，这个特大的喜讯传到了北京郊区将台公社花家地生产队。
    花家地生产队的广大贫下中农，聚集在扩音器下，许多人脸上滚动着兴奋的泪花。这里有生产队革命领导小组负责人刘启明，有农代会负责人、六十七岁的老贫农阎德龙。两年多来，他们带领着广大革命群众，同刘少奇和他在当地的代理人进行过激烈的搏斗。现在刘少奇被打倒了，他们怎么能不兴奋呢？他们用心地听着，一字一句地记着。他们感到公报的字字句句都有千斤重，都是毛主席领导广大无产阶级革命派在斗争中铸出来的。他们要把每个字都刻在心坎上。
    听完了广播，花家地的贫下中农激动的心再也按捺不住了，他们拿起唢呐，昂首向着晴朗的夜空吹了起来。他们擂起大鼓，打起铙钹，燃起爆竹，热烈欢庆这个伟大的胜利。花家地临近的水暖厂的工人们，排着整齐的队伍，捧着毛主席画像，抬着斗大的喜字，向贫下中农报喜来了。工人和贫下中农们聚集在生产队车场上热烈地交谈着，尽情地歌唱着。
    贫农刘启明说：过去刘少奇和他的狐群狗党彭真、刘仁一伙勾结花家地的地主、富农和国民党残渣余孽，大搞“三自一包”，“物质刺激”，把花家地生产队破坏得不象个样子。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开始了，花家地的贫下中农把被一小撮走资派篡夺的领导权重新夺了回来，并专了他们的政。广大贫下中农坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。贫农阎德龙老大爷高兴地说：“毛主席把我们花家地的贫下中农从要饭吃的苦难生活中救了出来，刘少奇这一帮坏家伙却妄图让我们再受二茬苦。把刘少奇永远开除出党，这是我们广大贫下中农的心愿！”
    夜渐渐深了，刘启明领着大家向着贫下中农心中的红太阳毛主席的画像宣誓：“一定要好好读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，永远跟着您干一辈子革命！”他们齐声敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
