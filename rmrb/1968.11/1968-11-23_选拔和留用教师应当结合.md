Selection and Retention of Teachers Should Be Combined

Chairman Mao has taught us: “The most important problem in running a military academy is the selection of the principal and teachers and the formulation of the educational policy.” This is indeed the fundamental policy for running all schools. The kind of principal and teachers a school selects will determine whether the school will revert to old ways or proceed along Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

We believe that the principal should be a member of the brigade revolutionary committee (or a member of the party branch committee). Teachers should be mainly selected from among the graduates of junior and senior high schools in the brigade, with those who are recommended by poor and lower-middle peasants and who strive to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, have made progress in ideological remolding, and have good labor performance. Those who are not suitable to continue as teachers should return to their brigades to engage in labor. For those who came from the cities to the countryside, they should be properly arranged to settle down in the countryside. After thoroughly changing their old ideas, they can still become teachers. This will also supplement the countryside with a portion of intellectuals.

Those teachers who have integrated well with workers and peasants, are widely supported by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and have made contributions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, should be retained. In this way, the retained teachers and the newly selected teachers can learn from each other and make joint progress.

    选拔和留用教师应当结合
    毛主席教导我们：“一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”这确实是办好一切学校的根本方针。一个学校选择什么样的校长教员，将决定这个学校是复旧还是沿着毛主席的革命路线前进。
    我们认为，校长应由大队革委会委员（或党支部委员）担任。教师应着重在本大队的历届初高中毕业生中，由贫下中农推举那些努力活学活用毛主席著作，并在改造思想方面有成效、劳动表现好的知识青年担任。对于原来的教师，不能一律排斥。那些和工农结合较好，深受广大贫下中农拥护，在文化大革命中又有贡献的教师，应当给予留任。这样，就能使留任的教师和新选拔的教师相互学习，共同提高。
    不适合继续当教师的人，出生于农村的应回本大队参加劳动；对从城市分配到农村去的人，也应适当地安排他们在农村安家落户，彻底改变旧思想以后，还可以当教师，这样做也为农村补充了一部分知识分子。
