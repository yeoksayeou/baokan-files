	Italian students from numerous high schools and universities, undeterred by the reactionary government's brutal suppression, have continued to hold massive demonstrations in many Italian cities over the past few days. They are protesting against the decaying bourgeois education system and strongly condemning the reactionary government's atrocities against the student movement.

	In Turin, a major industrial city in northern Italy, the students' struggle is intensifying. On the 23rd, students from 37 middle schools jointly held a large-scale strike. For the fifth consecutive day, they held a massive demonstration, angrily protesting the reactionary government's violence against students, including beatings and arrests. Over ten thousand students formed a three-kilometer-long procession in the heart of Turin, demonstrating for ten hours and bringing the city's traffic to a complete standstill. A large number of university students and workers joined the demonstration, supporting the middle school students' just struggle. Workers and students chanted slogans such as "Power to the working class" along the way.

	Middle school students in Biella and Ivrea, important industrial centers near Turin, also held strikes and demonstrations on the 23rd.

	In Rome, the capital, several thousand middle school students also held a demonstration on the same day. They expressed strong support for the students in Turin. Meanwhile, students at Rome University have been occupying the education department for fifteen days. Recently, a vocational school in Rome was also occupied by students.

	In Naples, over two thousand students who have been on strike bravely fought with the police on the 22nd. Nine students were unjustly arrested. On the 23rd, they held another demonstration, continuing their struggle.

	In Florence, five thousand students and workers held a demonstration on the 22nd, condemning the reactionary government's suppression of the workers' and students' movements, and supporting the students and workers who were being tried for participating in demonstrations.

	In Pescaro in central Italy and Taranto in southern Italy, over ten thousand students held demonstrations on the 22nd. Additionally, students in Pisa, Parma, Ravenna, Forli, Urbino, and other cities also held demonstrations.
