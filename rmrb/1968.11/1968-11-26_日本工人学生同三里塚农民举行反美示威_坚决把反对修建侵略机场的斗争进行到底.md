Japanese workers, students, and farmers of Sanrizuka in Chiba Prefecture held an anti-American rally to firmly oppose the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government. Eight thousand people, including farmers from Sanrizuka and workers and students from all over the country, gathered at Sanrizuka Park on November 24th to express their determination to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to continue the struggle against the construction of the airport.

Before the meeting began, workers, farmers, and students, armed with sticks, bamboo spears, and sickles, marched into the venue with red flags held high and fighting spirits. Two hundred workers and students wore helmets with slogans reading "Oppose Imperialism, Oppose Revisionism." In front of this group were several large red banners with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!"

The stage was adorned with banners reading "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'!" and "We will stop the construction of the New Tokyo International Airport!"

At the meeting, the leader of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement, Koyama Kazuo, delivered a speech. He emphasized, "Through long-term struggle, we have opened up a bright prospect for victory. In the course of our struggle, we have thoroughly fought against the treacherous actions of the Japan Communist Party's revisionist group, which attempted to split and weaken the people's forces in the struggle, and we have driven them out of our fighting ranks. This is an important step in our struggle for victory. We must unite more closely and stand together with the workers, farmers, and students of all Japan to continue the struggle, smash the conspiracy to seize farmers' land to build an airport for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia."

A young person at the meeting spoke about their efforts to go deep into the countryside, working alongside farmers to bravely continue the struggle. He said, "Since last year, the anti-American patriotic struggle has been surging forward, and we have always been at the forefront of this struggle. We are determined to strengthen our unity with workers, farmers, and students and to carry out a powerful anti-American patriotic struggle."

Miyagahara Masao, representing the farmers of Tama New Town in Ichikawa City who oppose the expansion of the U.S. military base at Tachikawa, also spoke at the meeting, expressing his determination to unite more closely with the farmers of Sanrizuka and fight shoulder to shoulder.

The secretary-general of the Chiba Prefecture branch of the Japan Socialist Party, Kase Tsuneo, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives of workers and students spoke one after another, expressing their determination to fight to the end and stop the construction of the airport by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The declaration adopted at the meeting stated: "The struggle in Sanrizuka is an important part of the struggle for Japan's independence." The declaration emphasized the need to smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to build the airport and to fight to the end to destroy the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

After the meeting, the participants, full of fighting spirit, held a massive demonstration march at the construction site of the airport.

The reactionary Sato government dispatched about 4,000 police in an attempt to suppress the demonstration, but in the face of the powerful struggle of the people, their plot failed.

    新华社二十五日讯　据东方通讯社报道：坚持反对美帝国主义和日本反动政府修建“新东京国际机场”的千叶县三里塚农民和来自全国各地的工人、学生共八千多人，二十四日在三里塚公园举行盛大的反美集会，表示决心粉碎日美“安全条约”，并且坚决把阻止修建机场的斗争进行到底。
    在开会之前，手拿木棍、竹矛和镰刀的工人、农民和学生的队伍举着红旗，斗志昂扬地进入会场。有二百名工人和学生头上戴着写有“反对帝国主义，反对修正主义”标语的帽盔。这支队伍的前面是一些巨大的红色横幅，上面写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    主席台上挂着“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”、“我们阻止修建新东京国际机场”等标语。
    三里塚农民运动领导人户村一作在会上发表讲话。他强调指出：“通过长期的斗争，我们已经为取得胜利开辟了光明的前景。我们在斗争过程中，对于企图分裂斗争和削弱斗争中的人民力量的日共修正主义集团的背叛行径进行了彻底的斗争，把他们从我们的战斗队伍中赶了出去。这是使我们的斗争取得胜利的重要步骤之一。我们要更加紧密地联合起来，并且同全日本的工人、农民和学生团结在一起，坚持斗争，粉碎剥夺农民土地来修建为美帝侵略亚洲效劳的机场的阴谋。”
    一位青年在会上谈到了他们深入到农民中去，同农民们一道坚持英勇斗争的情况。他说：“去年以来，反美爱国斗争不断蓬勃高涨，我们一直站在这一斗争的最前列坚持战斗。我们决心同工人、农民和学生加强团结，坚决进行声势浩大的反美爱国斗争。”
    宫冈政雄代表反对美国扩充立川军用机场的立川市砂川町的农民在会上讲了话，表示决心同三里塚的农民更加紧密地团结起来，并肩战斗。
    日本社会党千叶县总部书记长加濑包男也在会上讲了话。
    工人和学生的代表相继在会上讲话，表示要战斗到底，阻止美日反动派修建机场。
    会上通过的宣言指出：“三里塚的斗争是争取日本独立的斗争的重要一环。”宣言强调必须粉碎美日反动派修建机场的阴谋，并为摧毁美日“安全条约”而斗争到底。
    会后，参加大会的群众斗志昂扬地在修建机场的工地上举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    佐藤反动政府出动了约四千名警察，企图进行镇压，但是，在人民群众的强大斗争面前，它的阴谋没有得逞。
