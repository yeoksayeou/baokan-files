The Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, with its expanded membership, systematically summarized the rich experiences of the Cultural Revolution over the past two and a half years. It fully affirmed the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution and unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, traitor, spy, and scoundrel, from the Party permanently and to strip him of all his positions within and outside the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the Cultural Revolution. This wise decision expresses the common desire of all revolutionary people, and we support it a thousand times, ten thousand times!

The Cultural Revolution has revealed a great deal of evidence that Liu Shaoqi is a criminal who has been deeply buried in our Party for a long time. If he had not been expelled, capitalism would have been restored in our country, our revolutionary achievements would have been lost, and millions of people would have been beheaded. We would have suffered twice over.

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses led by it, and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Reviewing the history of the Cultural Revolution over the past two and a half years, the great victories we have achieved have powerfully proven that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, his great strategic deployment for the Cultural Revolution, his important instructions at various stages of the Cultural Revolution, and Vice Chairman Lin's speeches are all correct. The Central Cultural Revolution Group has played an important role in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is precisely because of the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that we have finally smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by Liu Shaoqi. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the lifeblood of our revolutionary people.

The plenum's communiqué has pointed out the direction for our continued advance and set forth the great historical task of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely carry it out and complete it! We are determined to continue the glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize proletarian politics, to carry forward the Party's three great styles of work, to be modest and prudent, to guard against arrogance and impatience, to follow Chairman Mao closely, to thoroughly sweep away the old, to dare to innovate, to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and to welcome the convening of the Ninth Party Congress.

Guangdong Province, facing Hong Kong and Macau, is a frontier of national defense where class struggle is particularly sharp and complex. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," to heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and to thoroughly smash any sabotage and disruption by domestic and foreign class enemies. If the enemy dares to attack, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them. We firmly support the heroic struggle of the Albanian people against imperialism and revisionism, the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism. The 40 million people of Guangdong, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, will certainly achieve greater successes in the great struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    响应全会号召，百倍提高革命警惕
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会，系统地总结了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的丰富经验，充分地肯定了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，并一致通过决议，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利。这个英明决定，表达了我们广大革命人民的共同心愿，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中揭露出来的大量事实证明，刘少奇是埋藏在我们党内很久、很深的一个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗。如果不把他清除出党，资本主义就会在我国复辟，我们的革命成果就会丧失，千百万人民就会人头落地，我们就会吃二遍苦。
    毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”回顾无产阶级文化大革命两年多来的历史，我们所取得的伟大胜利，有力地证明了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署，毛主席在文化大革命中各个时期的一系列重要指示，林副主席的多次讲话，都是正确的。中央文化革命小组在贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的斗争中，起了重要的作用。正是有了伟大的毛泽东思想，有了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们才终于摧毁了以刘少奇为首的资产阶级司令部。毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们革命人民的命根子。
    全会公报为我们指明了继续前进的方向，向我们提出了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大历史任务。我们坚决照办，坚决完成！我们决心继续发扬中国人民解放军的光荣传统，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，发扬党的三大作风，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，彻底破旧，大胆创新，认真搞好斗、批、改，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，迎接党的第九次代表大会的召开。
    广东省面临港澳，是祖国的国防前哨，阶级斗争特别尖锐、复杂。我们决心遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，百倍提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎国内外阶级敌人的任何破坏和捣乱。如果敌人敢于来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之。我们坚决支持英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的反帝、反修斗争，坚决支持英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，坚决支持世界革命人民反帝、反殖、反修的斗争。具有光荣革命传统的广东四千万人民，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，一定能在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，做出更大的成绩！
