The revolutionary model operas, which shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, including the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and other revolutionary model operas, were performed at the 1968 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou. They met with enthusiastic welcome from friends from five continents.

The news that Chinese revolutionary cultural workers would perform revolutionary model operas at the trade fair spread quickly, and foreign friends rushed to watch them. They felt that being able to see the world-renowned revolutionary model operas in China was a very fortunate and meaningful event, fulfilling their long-held aspirations. Some foreign friends changed their original travel plans to stay longer in Guangzhou to watch more revolutionary model operas, canceling their already booked airplane or train tickets. Some friends eagerly hoped that the model operas could be performed in their countries. Many friends also hoped that all the revolutionary model operas could be filmed and introduced to the world.

A friend from Europe praised the revolutionary model operas, saying, "The model operas are a great innovation in the history of human art. They are not only a precious treasure in the art treasury of the Chinese people but also a great contribution to the people of the whole world. This great fact will surely shock the world."

"Accepting the Greatest Revolutionary Truth—Mao Zedong Thought"

Friends from all over the world praised the revolutionary model operas in different languages. Several friends from the front lines of national liberation struggles in Africa did not miss the opportunity to watch every model opera, with some watching them over and over again.

One young friend among them said, "On the Chinese stage, we not only enjoyed the most perfect and moving artistic pleasure but also accepted the greatest revolutionary truth—the teachings of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese revolutionary cultural workers, through typical artistic images, deeply embodied Chairman Mao's great thought that 'revolutionary war is the people's war, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war.' This made us understand more deeply that the path of 'seizing power by armed struggle' indicated by Chairman Mao is the only correct revolutionary path. This is a great encouragement to us."

A friend from the Congo (Brazzaville) said, "The revolutionary modern Beijing opera 'The Red Lantern' showed us the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China against Japanese invaders. It teaches young revolutionaries like us: to defeat the enemy, we must not fear sacrifice; at the same time, it teaches us: to defeat the enemy, we must mobilize and organize the masses—regardless of gender or age—to fight to the death with the enemy."

A young woman from Osaka, Japan, after watching the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," said that these two revolutionary model operas, through sublime artistic images, embodied Chairman Mao's great revolutionary thoughts, pointing out a clear direction for the liberation struggle of Japanese women. The heroic characters in "The Red Lantern" and "The Red Detachment of Women" provide us with excellent examples to learn from. The model operas are powerful weapons to rouse the people to resist the revival of Japanese militarism and oppose American imperialism. We hope that these revolutionary modern operas can be performed in Japan, so that more Japanese people can be educated."

Foreign friends from various countries saw with their own eyes the thriving scene on the proletarian cultural stage in our country through the performances of the revolutionary model operas. They were deeply impressed by the powerful might of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

A responsible person from the General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) recently visited our country. When talking about his impressions of the revolutionary model operas in Guangzhou, he said, "This time I came to China to appreciate the revolutionary model operas with high revolutionary content and perfect artistic form. I learned that Chinese drama art has undergone a fundamental change. This change shows the thorough elimination of the remnants of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in the superstructure, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art occupy the stage of drama. This change was born in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and is the result of smashing the handful of class enemies like the Chinese Khrushchev. The heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers have today taken the stage of literature and art. How can we not be overjoyed and excited!"

A friend from Guinea said, "Watching the revolutionary model operas is a very good learning experience for us. Each revolutionary model opera excellently embodies Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary political line and revolutionary line on literature and art. It will inspire the revolutionary people of the world to unite, grasp the rifle, and fight to the end until they achieve complete victory."

"Peak of Contemporary Art"

Many foreign friends participating in the trade fair praised, saying that the Chinese revolutionary model operas are a new chapter written by the Chinese people in the history of human art and a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. A Japanese friend who has been engaged in music for many years watched the symphonic music "Shajiabang" and the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and other model operas. He said that when he was young, he participated in the activities of a choir, so he had a particularly deep feeling for these model operas. The performance of the model operas gave me a great shock. I used to think that the works of so-called Western art masters were peaks that could not be reached. Now, seeing the symphonic music "Shajiabang," I feel that this is the peak of contemporary art. This new art form, from the composition of the symphony orchestra to the performance form, is a great creation, greatly enriching the expressive power of symphonic music. It is a new type of, perfect art. Similarly, I used to think that the piano was the highest-level instrument, and its expressive ability had been fully exploited. However, this time, after listening to the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," I was greatly surprised. It broke through the original limitations and opened up a new path for the development of piano music. The revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "White-Haired Girl" broke through the old rules and conventions of ballet, both showcasing the strengths of ballet and adding folk dances loved by workers, peasants, and soldiers, paving a new way for proletarian ballet art. He also said, "Chinese revolutionary cultural workers have carried out a great reform in music art, successfully combining the political content of the proletariat with perfect artistic form. This is the great achievement of Chinese revolutionary cultural workers following the path indicated by Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Many foreign friends expressed after watching the revolutionary model operas that these revolutionary model operas will surely promote the just struggles of the revolutionary people of various countries against imperialism and modern revisionism, and set a brilliant example for the revolutionary literature and art of various countries. A friend from Guinea believes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only has great and far-reaching significance in China but also has great and far-reaching significance in the world. He said, "We completely accept Chairman Mao's great teaching: 'To make literature and art serve as a component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.' We firmly believe that by following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, the people of Guinea will surely create new literature and art that suits the revolutionary struggle needs of Guinea and has national characteristics, and create dramas that Guinea people can be proud of."

"The Spring of Proletarian Revolutionary Literature and Art in Full Bloom"

A friend from Latin America said that the revolutionary model operas are flowers blooming in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, indicating the arrival of the spring when proletarian revolutionary literature and art are in full bloom. He said, "We have already seen with our own eyes the arrival of a new era where the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the stage! Those emperors, officials, ladies, and misses have been driven off the stage. The history that was once overturned by feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism is now overturned again by Chinese revolutionary cultural workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought!"

A member of the joint delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association was very excited after watching the revolutionary model operas. He said, "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, led by Jiang Qing, the Chinese art circle friends have created a brand-new drama. You are shouldering the glorious task of opening the door to the future world of art." An African friend praised, saying, "All these model operas are one of the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China; they are precious gifts brought by the Chinese people to the revolutionary people of the world in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Another Japanese friend said, "The performance of the revolutionary model operas created by the Chinese people in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shows that the proletariat has occupied the stage on the cultural front in China, creating truly new socialist works for the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is developing forward. The new China built under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought is a fortress of world revolution. The new, revolutionary literature and art created by the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely exert great power, shaking the world!"

　　世界艺术史上的伟大创举
　　——参加广州交易会的五大洲朋友盛赞革命样板戏
    闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和其他革命样板戏，在广州举行的一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会上，同来自世界五大洲的外国朋友见面，受到了极为热烈的欢迎。
    中国革命文艺工作者在交易会上演出革命样板戏的喜讯传开，各国友人争相观看。他们感到能在中国一睹闻名中外的革命样板戏，是一件十分幸运、十分有意义的事情，是实现了他们早已向往的心愿。有些外国朋友为了能在广州多看一场革命样板戏，改变了自己原定的旅行计划，退掉了已经订购的飞机票或火车票；有些朋友热烈希望样板戏能到他们的国家去演出。还有许多朋友希望把全部革命样板戏摄制成电影，介绍到全世界去。
    一位来自欧洲的朋友用这样的话来评价革命样板戏：“样板戏是人类艺术史上的伟大创举，它不仅是中国人民的艺术宝库中的宝贵财富，对全世界人民也是一个伟大的贡献。这一伟大的事实，一定会震撼全世界。”
    “接受了最伟大的革命真理——毛泽东思想”
    来自世界各地的外国朋友，用不同的语言来赞美革命样板戏。来自民族解放斗争前线的几位非洲朋友，不放过观看每一个样板戏的机会，有的看了一遍又一遍。
    他们中间的一位青年朋友说：“我们在中国的舞台上，不仅得到了最完美动人的艺术享受，而且接受了最伟大的革命真理——毛泽东思想的教导。中国的革命文艺战士们通过典型的艺术形象，深刻地体现了毛主席关于‘革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争’这一伟大思想，使我们更深刻地领会到毛主席指引的‘武装夺取政权’的道路是唯一正确的革命道路，这对我们是巨大的鼓舞。”
    一位刚果（布）朋友说：“革命现代京剧《红灯记》向我们展示出，中国人民在毛主席、中国共产党领导下进行反对日本侵略者的英勇斗争事迹。它教育我们年轻的革命者：要战胜敌人，就要不怕牺牲；同时也教育我们：要打败敌人，就要动员和组织广大人民——不分男女老少，和敌人作拚死的斗争。”
    一位来自日本大阪的女青年，看了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》后说，这两个革命样板戏，通过崇高的艺术形象体现了毛主席的伟大革命思想，给日本妇女的解放斗争指出了明确的方向。《红灯记》和《红色娘子军》中的英雄人物，给我们提供了很好的学习榜样。样板戏是唤起人民反对复活日本军国主义、反对美帝国主义的强有力的武器，我们希望在日本演出这些革命现代戏，让更多的日本人民受到教育。
    各国朋友从革命样板戏的演出中，亲眼看到我国无产阶级文艺舞台上欣欣向荣的动人景象，对毛主席革命文艺路线的强大威力和我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就留下了深刻的印象。
    日中友协（正统）总部的一位负责人不久前来我国访问，他在广州谈到他对革命样板戏的观感时说：“这次我到中国来，观赏了具有高度革命内容和完美艺术形式的革命样板戏，了解到中国的戏剧艺术起了根本性的变革。这种变革，显示了彻底清除在上层建筑领域里残存着的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的东西，使毛主席的革命文艺路线占领了戏剧阵地。这种变革是在中国无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中产生的，是粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人的成果。工农兵的英雄形象今天登上了文艺舞台，这怎能叫我们不欢欣鼓舞，怎能不为之激动！”
    一位几内亚朋友说：“看革命样板戏，对我们来说，是一种很好的学习。每一个革命样板戏，都杰出地体现了毛主席的无产阶级革命政治路线和革命文艺路线，它将鼓舞全世界革命人民，团结起来，握紧枪杆，把斗争进行到底，直到赢得全面胜利。”
    “当代艺术的高峰”
    参加交易会的许多外国朋友赞扬说，中国革命样板戏，是中国人民在人类艺术史上写下的新的篇章，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。一位从事多年音乐工作的日本朋友，观看了交响音乐《沙家浜》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》等样板戏后说，我在年轻的时候从事过合唱团的音乐活动，所以对这些样板戏的感受特别深刻。样板戏的演出使我受到很大的震动。我过去认为，西方的所谓艺术大师的作品，是不可攀登的高峰。现在看到交响音乐《沙家浜》，觉得这才是当代艺术的高峰。这个艺术新品种从交响乐队的组成，到表演的形式，都是一个很大的创造，大大丰富了交响乐的表现力，这是一种新型的、完美的艺术。同样，过去我认为钢琴是最高级的乐器，它的表现能力已发挥到极境。可是这次听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，使我大吃一惊，它冲破了原来的局限性，为钢琴音乐的发展开辟了一条崭新的道路。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》和《白毛女》，突破了旧芭蕾艺术的陈规俗套，既发挥了芭蕾舞的特长，又加进了工农兵喜爱的民间舞蹈，为无产阶级芭蕾艺术闯出了新的道路。他还说：“中国的革命文艺工作者在音乐艺术上进行了伟大的改革，成功地把无产阶级的政治内容和完美的艺术形式结合起来。这是中国革命文艺工作者按照毛主席指引的道路，在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大成果。”
    许多外国朋友看了革命样板戏以后表示，这些革命样板戏必将促进各国革命人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的正义斗争，为各国的革命文艺树立了光辉的榜样。一位几内亚朋友认为，中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅在中国具有伟大深远的意义，在世界上也具有伟大深远的意义。他说：“我们完全接受毛主席的伟大教导：‘要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。’我们深信，沿着毛主席指引的道路前进，几内亚人民一定能够创造出适合几内亚革命斗争需要和具有本国民族特点的崭新的文艺，创作出值得非洲人民自豪的戏剧来。”
    “无产阶级革命文艺百花盛开的春天”
    一位来自拉丁美洲的朋友说，革命样板戏是在无产阶级文化大革命风暴中绽开的花朵，它表示无产阶级革命文艺百花盛开的春天的到来。他说：“我们已经亲眼看到，工农兵的英雄形象占领舞台的新时代到来了！那些皇帝、官僚、夫人、小姐被赶下了舞台，曾经被封建主义、资本主义、修正主义颠倒了的历史，现在由用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命文艺工作者，把它重新颠倒过来了！”
    日中友好协会（正统）、日中文化交流协会联合代表团的一位团员看了革命样板戏后，十分激动。他说：“在毛泽东思想指导下，由江青亲自率领，创造出崭新的戏剧的中国文艺界朋友们，你们肩负着打开未来世界艺术大门的光荣任务。”一位非洲朋友赞扬说：“所有这些样板戏，是中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成果之一；是中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中给全世界革命人民带来的珍贵礼物。”
    另一位日本朋友说：“中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中创造出来的革命样板戏的上演，说明在中国文化战线上，无产阶级占领了舞台，创造了真正为工农兵大众服务的、新的社会主义的作品，并正在向前发展。以伟大的毛泽东思想为指导建设起来的新中国，是世界革命的堡垒，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民所创造出来的崭新的、革命的文艺，必将发挥巨大威力，震撼世界！”
