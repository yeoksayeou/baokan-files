On the evening of November 15, the Tianzhuang Brigade in Shandong's Huantai County held a mass revolutionary criticism and learning session. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, holding the Little Red Book, expressed their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fiercely criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" and "work points as the commander" and other black goods.

The brigade leader, Comrade Tian Yuchun, presiding over the session, waved the Little Red Book and said excitedly: Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the expanded twelfth plenary session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The communiqué shines with golden light, and every sentence speaks to our hearts. We are holding this revolutionary criticism and learning session to express our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and to denounce the heinous crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi.

Be a person who is selfless and devoted to the public

Old poor peasant Tian Chenghuang stood up, holding the Little Red Book in one hand and raising an iron ladle in the other. He said excitedly, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two kinds: the worldview of the proletariat and the worldview of the bourgeoisie. Either it is the worldview of the proletariat, or it is the worldview of the bourgeoisie.' In the past, due to being poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the fusion of public and private interests,' there were still bourgeois ideas in my mind. Last winter, the ladle we used to serve rice at home broke. At that time, I remembered that the brigade had a ladle, so I took it home to use. It has been almost a year, and the brigade has not said anything, nor have I spoken up. Recently, our family started a Mao Zedong Thought study class at home. My daughter Aiqin said bluntly: 'Dad, you took the brigade's ladle. This is your selfishness acting up! Why don't you speak up?' My daughter's words made me feel embarrassed. I thought: I am so old, how can I reveal my selfishness in front of my children? My daughter seemed to see through my thoughts and said: 'We criticize Liu Shaoqi with our mouths, but the Liu Shaoqi in our minds must also be overthrown, otherwise, his poison will come back to life, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will have to go back and suffer again!' My daughter's words made my face burn and my heart race.

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chairman Mao's warm voice echoed in my ears: 'We should all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people.' Yes! Poor and lower-middle peasants should listen to Chairman Mao's words and be people who are selfless and devoted to the public. I did something that harmed the public interest for personal gain, clearly falling into Liu Shaoqi's trap of 'the fusion of public and private interests.' Why didn't I dare to reveal it? Not fighting against selfishness is disloyal to Chairman Mao and not hating Liu Shaoqi! Once the problem is elevated, my heart becomes anxious. The next day, I was the first to reveal my selfishness. With the help of my family, my understanding was further deepened.

My feelings for Chairman Mao have grown deeper, and my hatred for Liu Shaoqi has grown stronger. Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the fusion of public and private interests' is a soft knife that kills without bloodshed. Following his path leads to a dead end. We poor and lower-middle peasants have always hated selfishness as an enemy and loved the public interest as our life. From now on, I will definitely study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more actively, resolutely drive the selfishness out of my mind, and let the public interest take root in my mind, living a life devoted to the public until old age!

Fight a lifelong battle against selfishness and revisionism

Young brigade member Tian Sencheng said: In April this year, our brigade decided to promote the work points system of Dazhai. One evening, when the brigade was evaluating work points, I thought: In terms of physical strength, I am young and strong, and in terms of work, I am not worse than others. Whether they evaluate or not, getting ten work points a day is almost guaranteed. Before the evaluation, the brigade leader first led everyone to study a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." He continued, "When we evaluate work points, the first condition is to evaluate political thoughts, to see who studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought actively and fights against selfishness and revisionism well." As soon as the brigade leader's words fell, the brigade members started discussing. When it was my turn to be evaluated, opinions were divided. Some said, "Tian Sencheng studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought well and works hard." Others disagreed, saying that I did not study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively and was afraid of dirt and hard work. After discussion, everyone disagreed with giving me ten work points and criticized me. I was very upset and thought: Just wait and see! I will show you all. Due to impure motives, my selfishness grew heavier. Later, the more people there were, the more I showed that I was not afraid of dirt or hard work.

Once, after work, I saw a pile of cow dung in the middle of the road. I thought: Everyone says I am afraid of dirt and hard work. This time, let them see if I am afraid of dirt or hard work. So, I quickly ran up and picked it up with my hands and put it in the field. Everyone saw it and remembered it. In the second evaluation, everyone praised me. They said: "We should learn from Comrade Tian Sencheng, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, fight against selfishness and revisionism, think about the public interest, and work for the public interest, and be a selfless good brigade member."

Everyone's speech pierced my heart and gave me a deep education. I thought: I picked up the cow dung and put it in the field. On the surface, it seemed to be an act for the public interest, but behind this 'public interest,' there was a big selfish motive. In action, it seemed that I was not afraid of dirt, but in thought, it was dirtier than before. Isn't this the reflection of Liu Shaoqi's poison of 'the fusion of public and private interests' in my mind? Thinking of this, I could no longer sit still. I revealed my thoughts and realized that selfishness is the root of Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism. It is like a stubborn enemy that does not easily retreat from the mind. At any opportunity, it will counterattack. Only by being vigilant at all times and constantly using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, can we fight a lifelong battle against selfishness and revisionism, and truly devote ourselves to the public interest.

Politics in command, power unlimited

Brigade leader Tian Chengfu said: At the end of last month, our brigade planned to start cutting reeds in early this month. As soon as the news spread, some brigade members said, "Hey! This time we can make some money again." I heard this and felt that there was something behind these words. I thought: What is called making money is actually making work points. "Work points in command" is the black goods of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi! This is not a small problem but a big problem that relates to what flag to raise, what path to follow, and what line to execute. So, I organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with everyone.

In the study class, everyone studied Chairman Mao's great teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Then, I took the lead in denouncing and criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of promoting material incentives and "work points in command" and other revisionist black goods in the countryside. Old poor peasant Tian Juncheng angrily said: Liu Shaoqi is really evil. In the past, because my class struggle awareness was not strong and my awareness of the two-line struggle was not high, I fell into his trap, resulting in harming the state, deceiving the collective, and harming myself. If it were not for the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, I would have lost my head without knowing how I lost it. Now I realize: if politics does not take the lead, the direction will definitely be wrong, and selfishness will emerge. Liu Shaoqi's "work points in command" is pure sugar coated with arsenic. Whoever eats it becomes a revisionist. Poor peasant Tian Chengyu interrupted and said: Mao Zedong Thought is a guiding light, it is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. This year, we encountered a once-in-a-century drought. The revolutionary committee helped us organize a study class, and through studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," we established the idea of fighting against heaven and earth for the revolution. Everyone took the old fool as an example, overcame all difficulties, and finally achieved a bumper harvest. This is the result of Mao Zedong Thought being in command. The facts prove: politics in command, power unlimited; work points in command, not a step forward.

Everyone became more hateful of Liu Shaoqi and more loving of Chairman Mao. The more they criticized, the clearer their minds and eyes became, and the broader their hearts became, greatly enhancing their awareness of the two-line struggle. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought unified everyone's understanding, recognized the pros and cons of politics in command and "work points in command," and inspired everyone's socialist enthusiasm. On that day, everyone started working at two in the morning and worked until dawn. More than thirty mu of reeds were harvested in one-third of the time. Poor and lower-middle peasants used their actual actions to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and used their actual actions to expose Liu Shaoqi's tricks. In this way, the work that usually took more than six days was completed in two days this year, ensuring quality and quantity.

The night deepened, and the revolutionary criticism and learning session became more lively and active. Many people wanted to speak. At this time, the presider, Comrade Tian Yuchun, stood up and said excitedly: "Comrades, today's session was very good, inspiring, encouraging, and educational. In the future, we will follow the guidance of the communiqué, strive to do our best, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, to thoroughly criticize and expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi, and strive for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution!"

    批透批臭大叛徒刘少奇
    ——山东桓台县田庄公社田庄大队“革命大批判讲用会”纪实
    十一月十五日晚上，山东桓台田庄大队举行了一次群众性的革命大批判讲用会。广大贫下中农手捧红宝书，满怀对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚，狠批大叛徒刘少奇“公私溶化论”和“工分挂帅”等黑货。
    主持讲用会的大队领导成员田玉春同志挥动着《毛主席语录》，万分激动地说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报，字字闪金光，句句说出了我们的心里话。我们召开一次革命大批判讲用会，来表达我们对毛主席的无限忠诚的心情，来控诉大叛徒刘少奇的滔天罪行。
    做人要做一心为公的人
    老贫农田承黄，一手捧着红宝书，一手举着一把铁勺子站起来。他无限激动地说，毛主席教导我们：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”过去，由于我中了刘少奇散布的“公私溶化论”的毒害，脑子里还有资产阶级思想。去年冬天，俺家里盛饭用的勺子坏了，当时我想起队里有把勺子，就把它拿回来用啦。快一年了，队里也没找，我也一直没吭声。前不久，俺家办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，女儿爱芹开门见山地说：“爹，你拿队上的勺子，这是私心作怪呀！咋着不亮啊？”女儿的话，说得我怪难堪的，我想：我这么大年纪了，在孩子面前亮私心，怎么开口呀！女儿好象看透了我的心思，又说：“咱嘴上批的刘少奇有皮没毛，头脑里的刘少奇更要打倒，不然，他的流毒还会借尸还魂，咱贫下中农还要走回头路，重受二茬罪啊！”女儿的话，说得我脸热心跳。
    晚上，我翻来复去地睡不着，耳旁响起了毛主席的亲切声音：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”是啊！贫下中农就是听毛主席的话，做人要做一个一心为公的人。自己做了损公利己的事，明明上了刘少奇“公私溶化论”的当，为啥还不敢亮呢？有私不斗，就是对毛主席不忠，对刘少奇不恨！问题一上纲，心里就着了忙。第二天，我第一个亮了自己的私心。在全家人的帮助下，使我进一步提高了认识。
    俺对毛主席感情越来越深了，对刘少奇越批越恨了。刘少奇散布的“公私溶化论”，是一把杀人不见血的软刀子，照着他那条路走，死路一条。咱贫下中农从来就恨私如敌，爱公如命。往后，俺一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决把私字从脑袋瓜里扫地出门，让公字在头脑里安家落户，活到老，一心为公到老！
    打一辈子斗私批修的进攻战
    青年社员田森成说：今年四月份，俺队里决定推广大寨记工分的经验。一天晚上，队里评工分，我想：论身体，我年轻力壮，论干活，也不比他们差，管它评不评，一天十分工是十拿九稳的了。评比前，队长首先和大家学习了一段毛主席语录：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”他接着说：“咱们评工分，第一条首先是评政治思想好，看谁活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修好。”队长的话音刚落，社员们都纷纷议论开了。轮到评我的时候，大家的意见出现了分歧。有的说：“田森成活学活用毛泽东思想不错，老实肯干。”也有的不同意这种看法，说我学习毛泽东思想不能活学活用，干活怕脏怕累。经过讨论，大家都不同意评我十分工，还批评了我一顿。为此，我憋着一肚子气。心想：等着瞧吧！我一定做个样给你们看看。由于动机不纯，自己的私心越来越重。以后，越在人多的地方，我就越表现不怕脏不怕累。
    有一次，干活回来，我看到路中间有一堆牛粪。我想：人家都说我怕脏怕累，这回叫你们看看是不是怕脏怕累。于是，我急忙跑上前去，把它用手捧到地里。大伙看在眼里，记在心上。在第二次评比时，大伙纷纷表扬我。大伙说：“我们要向田森成同志学习，活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，心往公字上想，劲往公字上使，做一个一心为公的好社员。”
    大伙的发言刺痛了我的心，使我受到了深刻的教育。我想：我把牛粪捧到地里，表面上是为“公”的表现，但是，在这个“公”字背后，却隐藏着一个大私心。行动上看起来是不怕脏，但思想比以前更脏了。这不正是刘少奇“公私溶化论”的流毒在自己头脑中的反映吗？想到这里，我再也坐不住了。俺亮出了自己的思想，认识到私字是刘少奇复辟资本主义的总祸根，它象顽抗的敌人，在头脑里总是不肯轻易退走的，一有机会，就要反扑。只有随时随地提高警惕，不断地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向私字大打进攻战，才能一心贴在公字上。
    政治挂帅，威力无穷
    队长田承富说：上个月底，俺队上就合计着在月初开镰割苇子。消息一传开，有的社员说：“嘿！这回又该捞一把油水了。”我一听，觉得这话里有话，我想：所谓捞油水，其实就是捞工分，“工分挂帅”，这是党内头号走资派刘少奇的黑货！这决不是个小问题，而是关系到举什么旗，走什么路，执行什么路线的大问题。于是我就和大家一起举办了一期毛泽东思想学习班。
    在学习班上，大家学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，接着，我带头控诉和批判了大叛徒刘少奇在农村推行“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货的滔天罪行。老贫农田俊成也愤怒地说：刘少奇这个坏蛋，真坏透了。过去，由于俺阶级斗争观念不强，两条路线斗争觉悟不高，上了他的大当，结果是坑了国家，骗了集体，害了自己。要不是毛主席领导的文化大革命，真是脑袋掉了还不知道怎么掉的。现在俺认识到：政治不领先，方向一定偏，私字就冒尖。刘少奇那“工分挂帅”纯粹是包着砒霜的白糖，谁吃了谁变修。贫农社员田成玉抢上话茬开了腔：毛泽东思想是指路明灯，是咱贫下中农的命根子。今年，咱碰上了百年不遇的大旱年，革委会帮助咱们大办学习班，通过学习“老三篇”，树立了为革命战天斗地的思想。大伙以老愚公为榜样，排除万难，终于夺取了大丰收，这就是毛泽东思想挂了帅的结果。事实证明：政治挂帅，威力无穷；工分挂帅，寸步难行。
    大伙越批对刘少奇越恨，对毛主席越爱，越批心越明眼越亮，胸怀越宽阔，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。战无不胜的毛泽东思想统一了大伙的认识，认清了政治挂帅与“工分挂帅”的利害关系，激发了大伙的社会主义的积极性。就在这一天，大伙两点钟就纷纷上了坡，一气干到天明，三十多亩苇子一下收拾了三分之一。贫下中农都用实际行动向毛主席敬献忠心，用实际行动戳穿刘少奇的鬼把戏。就这样，往年需要六天多时间的活，今年只用两天时间，就保质保量完成了任务。
    夜深了，革命大批判讲用会越开越热烈，越开越活跃，要求发言的人很多。这时主持会议的田玉春同志站起来，激动地说：“同志们，今天的会开得很好，使人很受启发，很受鼓舞，很受教育。今后，我们要在公报的光辉指引下，鼓足干劲，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，为彻底批倒批臭大叛徒刘少奇，夺取文化大革命全面胜利而努力奋斗！
