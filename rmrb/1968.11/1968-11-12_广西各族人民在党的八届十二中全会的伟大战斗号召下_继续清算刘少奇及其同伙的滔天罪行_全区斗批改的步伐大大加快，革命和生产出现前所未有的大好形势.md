Under the great battle call of the Party's Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, the working class and revolutionary people of Guangxi are continuing to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle against the traitor, internal enemy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi with an unprecedented breadth and depth. The pace of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the entire region is advancing with a magnificent momentum under the inspiration of the plenary session's communiqué.

"The plenary session calls on all Party members and the people of the entire country to continue to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle, to sweep away the reactionary revisionist ideology of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by Liu Shaoqi and others." This is a great battle order. Following the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class and revolutionary people of all nationalities in Guangxi have responded enthusiastically. In the midst of the fervor to study, propagate, and implement the tasks set forth by the plenary session, they are vigorously and enthusiastically launching a new wave of revolutionary criticism against the traitor, internal enemy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. In recent days, revolutionary workers, cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals from various fronts such as industry, finance and trade, culture, education, and news in the autonomous region and Nanning City have successively held criticism and struggle meetings. With the spirit of thorough revolution to "thoroughly beat the fallen dog," they continue to settle accounts with the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Guangxi, such as He Ximing and Xie Wangang, who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. This has further raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary people. In the mountainous area of Huanjiang County, where more than 20,000 Mao Nong people live, the people immediately established more than 200 Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement the tasks proposed by the plenary session. In the fishing ports of the Jing people, Wutou Island, and Qutou Island by the Beibu Gulf, the poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen also widely established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these study classes, they use the communiqué as a weapon to fiercely criticize the reactionary revisionist fallacies that Liu Shaoqi spread in the countryside and fishing ports, such as "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms." Now, throughout the entire autonomous region, from urban factories to mountainous villages and coastal ports, from the border of Friendship Pass to the northern mountainous area of Guangxi, revolutionary people everywhere have set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism.

Currently, the characteristics of the deep and sustained revolutionary criticism in Guangxi are: closely linking the specific tasks of each unit and department, using one of Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon, fiercely criticizing one of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist fallacies, sweeping away one of his poisons, and implementing one of the battle calls of the communiqué. Under the inspiration of the spirit of the communiqué and the promotion of revolutionary criticism, the working class and revolutionary people of all nationalities in Guangxi are, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," enthusiastically and vigorously joining the great ranks of implementing the calls of the communiqué. The pace of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the entire region has greatly accelerated, and revolution and production have shown an unprecedented good situation.

Various levels of revolutionary committees have discussed and checked each item proposed by the communiqué, found gaps, made plans, and implemented them item by item. In the revolutionary criticism, they constantly break with the old and establish the new, making the new proletarian revolutionary power increasingly consolidated, developed, and perfected, and better performing the functions of proletarian dictatorship. Many leaders of revolutionary committees have gone deep into the grassroots and among the masses, conducted extensive investigations and research, summarized typical experiences, and led the revolutionary masses to launch a fervor of studying the communiqué and implementing the tasks proposed by the plenary session. The Nanning Revolutionary Committee recently held a meeting to seriously implement the communiqué and exchange experiences of class struggle, criticism, and reform, enabling some relatively backward units to learn from advanced experiences, further clarify the direction of class struggle, criticism, and reform, and formulate new measures to accelerate the implementation of class struggle, criticism, and reform.

Through studying the communiqué and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses and cadres have greatly improved, promoting the progress of the work of cleaning up the class ranks. Some units that have relatively early cleaned up the class ranks have, in implementing the communiqué, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," further investigated the enemy situation, and made the work of cleaning up the class ranks continuously deepen.

Under the inspiration of the plenary session's communiqué, the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangxi are rapidly launching a new wave of "grasp revolution, promote production." In recent days, the production of the Nanning Railway Bureau's 700-mile transportation line has frequently reported good news, with daily loading and unloading volumes creating the best results in half a year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have turned the boundless enthusiasm released from studying the communiqué and carrying out revolutionary criticism into a great force. The progress of autumn harvest, winter sowing, and autumn grain storage in the entire autonomous region has greatly accelerated.

　　广西各族人民在党的八届十二中全会的伟大战斗号召下
　　继续清算刘少奇及其同伙的滔天罪行
　　全区斗批改的步伐大大加快，革命和生产出现前所未有的大好形势
    新华社南宁十一日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的伟大战斗号召下，广西工人阶级和广大革命人民正以前所未有的广度和深度，继续开展对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判。全区斗、批、改的步伐，在全会公报的鼓舞下，以豪迈的气势不断迈向前进。
    “全会号召全党同志和全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想”，是一个伟大的战斗动员令。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的广西工人阶级和各族革命人民闻风而动，在学习、宣传公报、落实全会提出的各项战斗任务的热潮中，斗志昂扬，意气风发地对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。连日来，自治区和南宁市的工业、财贸、文化、教育、新闻等各条战线的广大革命职工、革命干部、革命的红卫兵、革命知识分子，连续召开批判斗争大会，以“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，继续清算刘少奇及其在广西的代理人贺希明、谢王岗之流反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，进一步提高了广大革命人民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。聚居着两万多毛难族革命人民的山乡——环江县下南区，在全会公报的鼓舞下，立即开办了二百多个落实全会提出的各项任务的毛泽东思想学习班；在北部湾畔的京族渔港巫头、?尾岛，贫下中农和渔民也普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在这些学习班里，他们以公报为武器，狠批刘少奇在农村、渔港散布的“三自一包”“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论。现在，全自治区范围内，从城市工矿到山村海港，从友谊关下到桂北山区，广大革命人民到处都摆开了革命大批判的战场。
    当前广西深入持久开展革命大批判的特点是：紧密结合各单位、各部门的各项具体任务，以伟大领袖毛主席的一条指示为武器，狠批刘少奇的一个反革命修正主义谬论，肃清他的一股流毒，落实公报的一项战斗号召。在公报精神的鼓舞下，在革命大批判的推动下，广西的工人阶级和各族革命人民正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，热火朝天地投入落实公报号召的伟大行列，全区斗、批、改的前进步伐已大大加快，革命和生产出现了前所未有的大好形势。
    各级革命委员会根据公报提出的各项战斗任务，逐条讨论，对照检查，找出差距，订出规划，逐条落实。在革命的大批判中，不断破旧立新，使新生的无产阶级革命政权不断巩固、发展和完善，更好地负担起无产阶级专政的职能。许多革命委员会的负责人都深入基层，深入群众，大搞调查研究，总结典型经验，以点带面，带领革命群众掀起学习公报、落实全会提出的各项任务的热潮。南宁市革委会最近召开了认真贯彻公报、交流斗、批、改经验大会，使一些比较后进的单位学到了先进经验，进一步明确了斗、批、改的方向，订出了新的加速搞好斗、批、改的措施。
    广大革命群众和革命干部，通过学习公报和深入开展革命大批判，阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，推动了清理阶级队伍工作的进展。一些清理阶级队伍比较早的单位，在落实公报中狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，进一步查敌情，使清理阶级队伍工作不断深入。
    在全会公报的鼓舞下，广西工人阶级和贫下中农正在迅速掀起一个“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。连日来，南宁铁路分局所辖七百里运输线上，生产捷报频传，日装卸量都创造了半年来的最新成绩。广大贫下中农把学习公报和开展革命大批判中焕发出来的冲天干劲，化为巨大的力量，全自治区秋收、冬种、秋粮入库的进度，大大加快。
