Such an Agricultural Middle School is Good
Report on the Investigation of the Agricultural Middle School in Luquan, Linze County, Gansu Province

Firmly Establish a Middle School That Meets the Hearts of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Located in the "Hexi Corridor," the Luquan Commune was economically and culturally backward in the dark old society. Poor and lower-middle peasants suffered from cruel exploitation and oppression and could not even think about going to school to read books. By the time of liberation, not a single poor and lower-middle peasant in this commune could read. After liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants had turned over in politics and economics, but due to the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, poor and lower-middle peasants had not truly turned over in culture. Although, after liberation, ten primary schools and two complete primary schools were established in this commune, and the county's full-time middle school, Linze No. 2 Middle School, was also located here, these schools were controlled by bourgeois intellectuals and implemented the revisionist educational line. Therefore, a large number of children of poor and lower-middle peasants were still excluded from the school gates. Some of those who entered school were also poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "promotion first," "study to be an official" revisionist educational line, longing to go to the city and unwilling to stay in the countryside. Therefore, out of the 102 production teams in the entire commune, one-third of the teams still cannot find an accountant. Poor and lower-middle peasants angrily say that these schools are not for us.

In 1965, after the Four Cleanups movement, the Luquan Commune launched a vigorous movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. With deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the world, and build the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. Thus, there was an urgent need for a batch of young people who were good in thought, good in labor, and had some culture to guide the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works.

The problems and the development of the situation in front of them made the poor and lower-middle peasants in Luquan Commune decide to establish a school that is guided by Mao Zedong Thought and meets the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants. At this time, the old county education bureau's capitalist-roaders came to the full-time middle school located in Luquan Commune for an "inspection." Upon hearing that the poor and lower-middle peasants wanted to establish a non-"regular" agricultural middle school, they immediately issued several orders, saying that students over 18 years old were not allowed to enroll; schools could not open with fewer than 25 students; middle schools could not be turned into accounting training classes, etc., attempting to strangle this school. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the commune did not care about the capitalist-roaders' nonsense. They vacated two old rooms as classrooms, allocated three acres of good land as a farm, and selected three young intellectuals who had undergone several years of labor tempering and were enthusiastic about serving the poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers, finally establishing the school.

After the agricultural middle school opened, due to the influence of the revisionist educational line and the sabotage of a small handful of class enemies, only 11 students enrolled. Some people with ulterior motives again coldly sneered, saying, "A few students, it doesn't look like a school at all, and it's called an agricultural middle school!" The poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely replied, "As long as it is run according to the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants, it is a good example. Even five students can start school."

Firmly Follow the "Anti-Jiangxi" Road and Act According to the "May 7th" Directive

This school, established by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves, from the very beginning, was run according to the educational policy personally formulated by Chairman Mao for the "Anti-Jiangxi." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive and ran the school even better.

First, they followed the educational policy of the "Anti-Jiangxi," placing the firm and correct political direction in the first place, resolutely implementing proletarian political school building, and placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the primary position. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The students we cultivate do not talk about this or that, but only require one fundamental thing, that is, loyalty to Chairman Mao, love for poor and lower-middle peasants, love for collective labor, and achieve both not leaving labor and not leaving the masses." This middle school took Chairman Mao's works as the main course, accounting for two-thirds of the entire curriculum. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume B and the "Three Articles" are the basic textbooks, linking the current situation, combining class struggle, targeting active thoughts, and studying and applying them in combination. In other courses, Mao Zedong Thought was also used as the guide, whether it was cultural courses or labor courses, whether in the classroom or in the fields, every class had to first study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions.

For example, when teaching "accounting knowledge," they first studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," "self-reliance," "frugal construction of the country," "frugal management of all undertakings," and "thrift makes revolution." The school also invited poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and sweetness, giving teachers and students a class on class struggle, organizing teachers and students with poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out revolutionary criticism, engage in struggles against the enemy, and temper teachers and students in fierce class struggles, continuously improving class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness.

Second, following Chairman Mao's teaching that education must be combined with productive labor, taking the excellent style of the "Anti-Jiangxi" of "studying while working" as an example, they insisted on working while studying, being self-reliant, and running the school frugally. Not long after the school was established, the poor and lower-middle peasants felt that the school was located in the town, with only three acres of land, and could not give teachers and students good labor tempering. Therefore, they selected a patch of wasteland covered with reeds, built a few houses, allocated two carts and an iron pot, and let the teachers and students work there themselves, opening up the wasteland and building the school. They studied half a day and worked half a day, cooked their own food, and gathered firewood together. In a few months, they opened up more than 30 acres of wasteland with shovels, sowed wheat, rice, corn, and vegetables, and harvested more than 4,000 pounds of grain in the first year. The second year, the commune allocated more than 60 acres of land and some livestock to the agricultural middle school. Now, this school has developed in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and this year it harvested more than 18,000 pounds of grain and 640 pounds of oil. In this way, the school had economic conditions, did not charge tuition, and provided students with a portion of their food, reducing the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants. More importantly, the teachers and students had spiritual gains. After going through hard labor tempering, they understood more about the glory of labor and deepened their feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Third, following Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, they studied politics, culture, and military affairs, and criticized the bourgeoisie. Political classes, in addition to studying Chairman Mao's works, also invited commune and brigade cadres to give situation reports and invited activists in studying Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Cultural classes were closely combined with reality, and the content was arranged according to the urgent needs of the countryside, setting up courses such as "practical writing," accounting knowledge, and abacus. Agricultural production knowledge courses were taught in the fields, learning what was done, learning while doing, and combining learning with use. Military classes were taught by militia cadres and demobilized soldiers, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, learning the Four Firsts, the Three-Eight Style, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and conducting military training, etc. Teachers and students also set aside a certain amount of time each week to participate in rural revolutionary criticism, working with poor and lower-middle peasants to criticize the "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and other revisionist black goods promoted by the number one capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in the countryside, and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's promotion of "study to be an official," "intellectual education first," and "grades first" revisionist educational line.

Sharp Contrasts

What kind of line, what kind of school; what kind of teacher, what kind of student. The Luquan Agricultural Middle School and Linze County No. 2 Middle School are both located in one commune, only seven or eight li apart. However, one is run by poor and lower-middle peasants, managed by poor and lower-middle peasants, and opens its doors wide to poor and lower-middle peasants; the other is run by the county, managed by the county, and controlled by bourgeois intellectuals. The two middle schools, with leadership in the hands of two different classes, implement two different educational lines, so the appearance of the schools and the students they cultivate have formed sharp contrasts.

Students in the agricultural middle school labor in school and also participate in labor when they return to the team, rolling in the dirt, crawling in the mud, and sweating with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever there is a big meeting, they naturally sit and sing with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some students in Linze No. 2 Middle School, after a few days of study, felt "superior," "speaking in a big voice, walking in big steps, and having a big attitude," and when they encountered meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants, they always sat far away, afraid to get a little dirt on them.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the teachers and students of Luquan Agricultural Middle School firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, united with the poor and lower-middle peasants into a fighting whole, and launched a counterattack against a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the county and commune parties, implementing proletarian dictatorship over the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside. The students of Linze No. 2 Middle School, due to a small handful of class enemies who had infiltrated the teaching staff, stirred up strife, engaged in anarchism, and caused long-term splits and "internal wars" among teachers and students, unable to quickly resume classes and make revolution. Luquan Agricultural Middle School, following Chairman Mao's educational policy, based on the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants, has cultivated a batch of students in three years. These students, when they return to the production team, can work with a hoe, can keep accounts with a pen, and mostly serve as guides for studying Chairman Mao's works, accountants, warehouse keepers, and village school teachers, becoming active elements in the three great revolutions in the countryside. On the contrary, Linze No. 2 Middle School's funds are allocated by the state, and the teachers are sent by higher authorities. Although it is located in the countryside, it faces the city and cultivates students who think about "promotion, becoming an official, earning money without labor." You ask him to return to the team to labor, and he says, "Go to university, study to be a teacher, and only agricultural middle school graduates become farmers." You say the production team needs an accountant, and he says, "An abacus and a pen, being an accountant is not promising."

The poor and lower-middle peasants see it in their eyes and think it in their hearts: Why are these public schools set up in our countryside, but their doors are not open to us poor and lower-middle peasants? Why are these schools just a wall away from us, but they have two different hearts? After this profound Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants finally understood. It turns out that it was the big bad guy Liu Shaoqi who did it. He handed over the power of the schools run by the party and the state to those bourgeois intellectuals and implemented his black line. As a result, the blood and sweat of the working people fed those bourgeois intellectuals, and the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who entered school were corrupted by them. The poor and lower-middle peasants hated Liu Shaoqi and his black line to the core and angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line must be criticized to the end! The bourgeois educational system must be smashed to pieces!"

Two sharp contrasts made the poor and lower-middle peasants in Luquan Commune draw a conclusion: "It is still our poor and lower-middle peasants who run the school according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line that is good!" This year, when Luquan Commune discussed the allocation of primary school graduates, many poor and lower-middle peasants firmly wanted their children to enter Luquan Agricultural Middle School and not the public full-time middle school.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "In the countryside, it should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." After this latest directive from Chairman Mao was transmitted, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Luquan Commune were overjoyed, running around telling each other, excitedly saying, Chairman Mao is supporting us, we must make Chairman Mao proud. They quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest directive, establishing a commune school management committee composed of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students, leading the educational revolution of the entire commune. The poor and lower-middle peasants confidently said, we must follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, manage and run the rural schools well, and carry out the educational revolution to the end.

    这样的农中就是好
    甘肃省临泽县蓼泉农业中学调查报告
    坚决办一所合咱贫下中农心意的中学
    地处“河西走廊”的蓼泉公社，在黑暗的旧社会，经济、文化都十分落后。贫下中农受着残酷的剥削和压迫，根本谈不到上学读书。到解放时，这里的贫下中农没有一个识字的。解放后，广大贫下中农在政治上、经济上都翻了身，但是，由于叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线，贫下中农在文化上没有真正翻身。尽管解放后在这个公社设立了十所初小、两所完小，县上的一所全日制中学——临泽二中也设在这里，可是，由于这些学校为资产阶级知识分子所统治，贯彻的是修正主义教育路线，因而大批贫下中农子女仍然被排斥在校门之外。少数进了学校的贫下中农子女，有些人也在刘少奇的“升学第一”、“读书做官”的修正主义教育路线毒害下，一心向往城市，不愿留在农村。因此，全公社一百零二个生产队，至今还有三分之一的队找不到一个当会计的。贫下中农气愤地说，这些学校就不是为咱办的。
    一九六五年，经过四清运动，蓼泉公社兴起了一个蓬蓬勃勃的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，决心把毛泽东思想真正学到手，用毛泽东思想改天换地，把农村建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。这样，又迫切需要一批思想好、劳动好、又有文化的青年，为贫下中农学习毛主席著作当辅导员。
    摆在面前的问题和形势发展的需要，使蓼泉公社贫下中农下决心要办一所用毛泽东思想统帅的、符合贫下中农心意的学校。正在这时，旧县文教局的走资派来到设在蓼泉公社的全日制中学进行“视察”，一听说贫下中农要办一所不“正规”的农业中学，就立即下了几道限令，说，学生年龄在十八岁以上的不准入学；学生不到二十五人不能开学；中学不能办成会计训练班，等等，企图扼杀这所学校。贫下中农和公社革命干部根本没有理走资派那一套。他们腾出两间旧房当教室，拨出三亩好地作农场，从农村里挑选了三名经过几年劳动锻炼、热心为贫下中农办事的知识青年做教师，终于把学校办起来了。
    农中开学后，由于修正主义教育路线的影响和一小撮阶级敌人的破坏，到校学生仅十一名。一些别有用心的人又冷潮热讽地说：“几个学生，一点也不象个学校的样子，还挂个农业中学的牌子！”贫下中农坚决回答说：“只要办得符合贫下中农的要求，就是好样的。五个学生也可以开学。”
    坚决走“抗大”的道路  照“五·七”指示办事
    这所由贫下中农自己创办的学校，从一开始就按照毛主席亲手为“抗大”制定的教育方针办学。无产阶级文化大革命中，他们学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示，把学校办得更好。
    第一，他们按照“抗大”的教育方针，把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，坚决实行无产阶级政治建校，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首要的地位。贫下中农说：“我们学校培养的学生，不讲这条，不讲那条，只要求根本的一条，就是忠于毛主席，热爱贫下中农，热爱集体劳动，做到身不脱离劳动，心不脱离群众。”这个中学把毛主席著作作为主课，占全部课程的三分之二，《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本和“老三篇”是基本教材，联系当前形势，结合阶级斗争，针对活思想，活学活用，学用结合。在其它课程方面，也都用毛泽东思想作统帅，不论是文化课还是劳动课，不论是在课堂还是在田间，每次上课都要首先学习毛主席的有关教导。
    如讲“会计知识”时，就首先学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”、“自力更生”、“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办一切事业”、“节约闹革命”等教导。学校还请贫下中农忆苦思甜，给师生上阶级斗争课，组织师生和贫下中农一起开展革命大批判，进行对敌斗争，使师生在激烈的阶级斗争中经受锻炼，不断提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    第二，遵照毛主席关于教育必须同生产劳动相结合的教导，以“抗大”“一面学习，一面生产”的优良作风为榜样，坚持一面劳动，一面学习，自力更生，勤俭办学。学校建立不久，贫下中农感到学校设在街上，只有三亩土地，不能使师生得到很好的劳动锻炼，于是选了一片湖草丛生的荒滩，修建了几座房子，拨了两辆架子车和一口铁锅，让师生们在那里自己动手，开荒建校。他们半天上课，半天劳动，饭自己做，柴大家拾，在几个月的时间里，用铁锨一锨一锨开出了三十多亩荒地，播种了小麦、稻子、玉米和蔬菜，头一年就收获粮食四千多斤。第二年，公社又拨给农中六十多亩土地和一些牲畜。现在，这个学校农、林、牧都得到了发展，今年收获粮食一万八千多斤，油料六百四十多斤。这样，学校就有了经济条件，免收学费，并给学生补助一部分口粮，减轻了贫下中农的负担。更重要的是师生们思想上的收获。他们经过艰苦的劳动锻炼，更懂得了劳动光荣，更加深了对贫下中农的感情。
    第三，按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，又学政治，又学文化，又学军事，又批判资产阶级。政治课除了学习毛主席著作外，还请公社、大队干部作形势报告，请学习毛主席著作积极分子讲活学活用毛泽东思想的体会。文化课密切结合实际，根据农村的迫切需要安排内容，设置了“应用文”、会计知识、珠算等课程。农业生产知识课则放在田间地头学，干什么，学什么，边干边学，学用结合。军事课请民兵干部和复员军人教，以解放军为榜样，学习四个第一、三八作风、三大纪律八项注意，进行军事训练等。师生们每周还抽出一定时间参加农村革命大批判，与贫下中农一起，开展对党内头号走资派刘少奇在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义黑货的批判，开展对刘少奇鼓吹的“读书做官”、“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等修正主义教育路线的批判。
    鲜明的对比
    什么样的路线，办什么样的学校；什么样的教师，培养什么样的学生。蓼泉农中与临泽县二中同设在一个公社，相距不过七八里。但是，一个由贫下中农办，由贫下中农管，向贫下中农敞开大门；一个则是县上办，县上管，由资产阶级知识分子统治。两个中学，领导权掌握在两个不同的阶级手里，贯彻的是两条不同的教育路线，因而学校的面貌，培养出的学生，都形成了鲜明的对比。
    农中的学生，在学校里劳动，回到队里也参加劳动，土里滚，泥里爬，与贫下中农汗流在一起，心贴在一起。每逢开大会，他们自然而然地与贫下中农“一搭里坐，一搭唱歌。”临泽二中的一些学生，上了几天学，就觉得“高人一等”，“说话口气大，走路步子大，见人架子大”，遇到和贫下中农一起开会，总象贫下中农身上有“刺”似的，坐得远远的，生怕沾上点土。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，蓼泉农中师生坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同贫下中农结成一个战斗的整体，大造了县、社党内一小撮走资派的反，对农村中的地、富、反、坏、右分子实行了无产阶级专政。临泽二中学生则由于一小撮混进教师队伍的阶级敌人兴风作浪，挑动武斗，搞无政府主义，使学校师生长期分裂，“内战”不止，不能迅速复课闹革命。蓼泉农中遵照毛主席的教育方针，根据贫下中农的需要，三年来培养出了一批学生。这些学生回到生产队，拿起锨来能干活，拿起笔来能记账，大都担任了学习毛主席著作辅导员、会计、保管员、民办小学教师，成为农村三大革命的积极分子。相反地，临泽二中经费是国家拨的，教师是上级派的，虽然设在农村，却是面向城市，培养出的学生想的是“升学当干部，挣钱不劳动”。你叫他回队劳动，他说：“升大学，考师范，农中出来才当庄稼汉。”你说生产队需要会计，他说：“一把算盘一支笔，当个会计没出息。”
    贫下中农看在眼里，想在心里：为啥这些公办学校设在咱农村，大门却不朝咱贫下中农开？为啥这些学校和咱仅隔一道墙，却和咱们是两条心？经过这场深刻的无产阶级文化大革命，贫下中农彻底明白了。原来是刘少奇这个大坏蛋作的怪。他把党和国家办的学校的大权交给那些资产阶级知识分子掌，贯彻他那一套黑路线。结果，劳动人民的血汗养活了那些资产阶级知识分子，进了学校的贫下中农的子女，却被他们给带坏了。贫下中农恨透了刘少奇和他那套黑路线，气愤地说：“刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线一定要批臭！资产阶级教育制度坚决要砸烂！”
    两种鲜明的对比，使蓼泉公社贫下中农得出一个结论：“还是咱们贫下中农按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线办的学校好！”今年，蓼泉公社讨论分配高小毕业生，许多贫下中农坚决要自己的孩子进蓼泉农业中学，不进公办全日制中学。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席这一最新指示传来后，蓼泉公社广大贫下中农兴高采烈，奔走相告，兴奋地说，毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定为毛主席争气。他们迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，建立了由贫下中农代表、革命干部、革命师生代表参加的公社管理学校委员会，领导全公社的教育革命。贫下中农满怀信心地说，我们一定要遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，把农村学校管好、办好，把教育革命进行到底。
