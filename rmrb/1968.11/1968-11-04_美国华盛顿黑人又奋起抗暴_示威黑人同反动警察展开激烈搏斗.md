Washington's Black Community Rises Again Against Brutality

Fighting Breaks Out Between Protesting Blacks and Reactionary Police

		BEIJING, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 — The U.S. capital of Washington saw another round of black resistance against brutality yesterday. This is the third time in a month that Washington's black community has taken to the streets to resist the brutal oppression of the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

		On Nov. 2, fascist police patrolling the black residential areas of Washington opened fire without provocation, wounding two black women. This is yet another bloody crime committed by the U.S. reactionaries against American blacks, following the police murder of a black youth in Washington last month.

		Witnessing this atrocity, black youths in the area immediately sprang into action. Other black residents, upon hearing the news, quickly gathered to hold a protest demonstration. They overturned cars belonging to white racists and set fire to three of them. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique dispatched a large number of police, who repeatedly fired tear gas at the black crowds and carried out mass arrests and suppression. They also put a large contingent of the National Guard on alert, ready to launch an even larger-scale suppression of blacks at any moment. However, the black youths showed no fear and engaged in fierce struggles with the police.

		In addition, on Nov. 2, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, black residents in a resistance struggle injured eight fascist police, demonstrating the courageous fighting spirit of blacks.

    美国华盛顿黑人又奋起抗暴
    示威黑人同反动警察展开激烈搏斗
    新华社三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国首都华盛顿市二日再次爆发了一场黑人抗暴斗争。这是在最近一个月内，华盛顿市的黑人第三次走上街头，反抗美国反动统治集团对他们的残酷镇压。
    二日，在华盛顿市黑人聚居区巡罗的法西斯警察，无故开枪打伤了两名黑人妇女。这是继上月八日华盛顿市的警察残杀一名黑人青年之后，美国反动派对美国黑人所犯下的又一起血腥罪行。
    在当地目睹这一暴行的黑人青年，立即行动起来，其他黑人群众闻讯后也纷纷赶来举行抗议示威。他们把白人种族主义者的汽车翻倒，并放火烧掉了三辆。美国反动统治集团出动大批警察，一再对黑人群众施放大量催泪瓦斯，并进行大规模的逮捕和镇压，同时下令大批国民警卫队处于警戒状态，随时准备对黑人进行更大规模的镇压。但是黑人青年毫不畏惧，同警察展开了激烈的搏斗。
    此外，二日在宾夕法尼亚州的兰开斯特，黑人群众在一场抗暴斗争中，打伤了八名法西斯警察，显示了黑人的英勇斗争精神。
