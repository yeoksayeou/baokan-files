	Prague, November 8 (New China News Agency) — Despite the armed suppression by the Soviet revisionist occupying forces and the Czech revisionist traitor clique, the people of Czechoslovakia bravely held massive demonstrations against the Soviet revisionists' long-term military occupation on November 6 and 7. This is another large-scale struggle against the Soviet occupation by the Czechoslovak people following their protests on October 28.

	According to reports, on the evening of the 6th, thousands of Prague citizens held demonstrations against the Soviet military occupation. Among them, hundreds of young people broke through the blockade by the Czech revisionist police and fought outside a theater where the Soviet revisionist delegation and Czech revisionist leaders were watching a performance.

	On the 7th, from morning to late at night, thousands of young students, workers, and citizens in Prague held continuous demonstrations on the city's main streets and squares, causing traffic in Prague to come to a standstill. The Czech revisionist authorities, terrified by the people's struggle, dispatched large numbers of police, using batons, tear gas, water cannons, and even arrests to suppress the demonstrators. However, the demonstrators, fearing no violence, shouted slogans such as "Freedom, freedom!" "Russians go home!" "Burn Brezhnev!" A group of demonstrators also surrounded a car belonging to the Soviet occupying forces and, despite the Soviet soldiers in the car firing warning shots, spat at and mocked the Soviet occupying forces loudly.

	Meanwhile, students and teachers at some institutions in Prague went on strike on the 7th to protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia. Thousands of students at Charles University went on strike wearing black armbands. They passed a resolution at their meeting demanding the complete withdrawal of the Soviet occupying forces.

	In Bratislava, more than 4,000 workers, young students, and citizens also held demonstrations against the Soviet military occupation on the evening of the 6th. On the 7th, tens of thousands of young people marched in lines on the streets, shouting slogans against the Soviet military occupation along the way. They bravely fought against the suppression and arrests by the Czech revisionist police and military, and also directed scornful laughter at the Soviet occupying forces driving by on the streets.

	To suppress the Czechoslovak people's demonstrations, the Soviet occupying authorities had already moved large numbers of troops from the countryside to barracks near Prague as early as the evening of the 3rd.

	The Czech revisionist authorities also ordered a "ban on public gatherings," threatening young students that they would be expelled if they participated in demonstrations, and warning the public that "no illegal incidents will be tolerated."

	However, the large-scale demonstrations in Prague and Bratislava once again fully demonstrated that the threats and intimidation by the Soviet occupying forces and the Czech revisionist traitor clique cannot frighten the Czechoslovak people.

    不畏捷修镇压  蔑视苏修威胁
    捷人民再次示威反对苏修军事占领
    新华社八日讯　布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克人民不顾苏修占领军和捷修叛徒集团的武装镇压，在十一月六日和七日，连续英勇地举行声势浩大的反对苏修长期军事占领的游行示威。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民继十月二十八日之后，十几天来开展的又一次大规模的反对苏修占领的斗争。
    据报道，六日晚上，数以千计的布拉格市民举行了反对苏修军事占领的示威游行，其中有数百名青年冲破捷修警察的封锁，在苏修代表团和捷修头目观看演出的剧院外面开展斗争。
    七日，从上午到深夜，数千名布拉格的青年学生、工人和市民，在布拉格主要街道和广场连续举行游行示威，使得布拉格的交通陷于瘫痪。捷修当局对人民的斗争怕得要命，出动大批警察，使用警棍、催泪弹和水龙甚至逮捕等手段，镇压示威群众。但是，示威群众不畏强暴，高呼：“自由，自由！”“俄国佬滚回去！”“烧死勃列日涅夫！”等口号。一批示威群众还包围了一辆苏修占领军的汽车并不顾这辆车上的苏修占领军开枪恫吓，向苏修占领军吐唾沫和发出大声的嘲笑。
    与此同时，布拉格的一些院校的学生和教师七日举行罢课，抗议苏修占领捷克斯洛伐克。查理大学的成千名学生七日佩带黑纱举行罢课。他们在集会上通过一项决议，要求苏修占领军完全撤退。
    在布拉迪斯拉发市，六日晚上四千多工人、青年学生和市民也举行了反对苏修军事占领的游行示威。七日，有成万的青年在街道上列队游行，他们沿途高呼反对苏修军事占领的口号。他们不顾捷修警察和军队的镇压和逮捕，进行了英勇的斗争。他们还向在街道上坐车驶过的苏修占领军发出轻蔑的嘲笑。
    为了镇压捷克斯洛伐克人民这次游行示威，苏修占领军当局早在三日晚上就把大批军队从乡村调到靠近布拉格的兵营。
    捷修当局也下令“禁止人民在户外集会”，恫吓青年学生，如参加示威游行“将予开除”，叫嚷不许呼所谓“轻率的口号”，并威胁群众说，“决不容忍任何违法事件”发生。
    但是，布拉格和布拉迪斯拉发等地又一次大规模的游行示威，再次充分地说明苏修占领军和捷修叛徒集团的一切威胁和恫吓是吓不倒捷克斯洛伐克人民的。
