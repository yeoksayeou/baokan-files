The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: “A person has arteries and veins, and through the heart, blood circulation is carried out. He also needs to breathe through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party also needs to expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality.” Chairman Mao’s latest directive teaches us an unshakable truth: a person who does not expel the old and take in the new will stop living; a proletarian party that does not expel the old and take in the new will also stop living.

From the perspective of class struggle in our military-controlled unit, if we do not remove those traitors, spies, and stubborn capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party and usurped leadership positions, it will be difficult for genuine proletarian revolutionaries to be absorbed into the party. On this issue, it is a matter of not breaking down the old to build the new. Only by expelling the old and taking in the new can the party remain vigorous.

Our military-controlled unit originally had a company manager who was an old spy. When he was in power, he recruited and accommodated traitors, formed cliques, and to assemble a team for restoring capitalism, he even transferred away two so-called incompetent engineers and a technician, replacing them with a remnant of the Kuomintang with whom he had long collaborated, and promoted him to the position of deputy chief engineer, controlling the entire company's engineering and technical power. Additionally, he gathered many bad elements, pulling many exploiters and class enemies into the party and placing them in key positions.

This bunch of bad elements seized party and government power, where were the workers' positions?! Some old workers who were loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line were seen as thorns in their eyes. Some old workers who had written multiple applications and waited for over a decade were still unable to join the party simply because they were “disobedient” and did not meet their tastes. For those who stood firm and dared to uphold principles, fighting resolutely against class enemies, they used the method of transfer to expel them in every possible way. Under the control of these bad elements, the entire company's party organization was in a state of stagnation, almost paralyzed. A few originally good party members were corrupted by them, even falling into the swamp of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a thunderclap, brought about earth-shaking changes to this company. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, armed with Chairman Mao’s latest directives, through revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, the broad revolutionary masses finally unearthed these deeply hidden class enemies, seizing back the leadership power they had usurped. The workers were overjoyed, and a large number of genuine proletarian rebels, especially those outstanding old workers who had long been excluded from the party, realized or were about to realize their long-held wishes. Chairman Mao’s latest directive on the proletarian party needing to “expel the old and take in the new,” continuously absorbing fresh blood, reflects the urgent needs of the broad masses of workers, speaking the words in their hearts!

We must implement Chairman Mao’s latest directives, resolutely eliminate waste, and continuously absorb fresh blood.

　　坚决清除废料  吸收新鲜血液
　　空军某部驻包头某公司军代表　丁盘根
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的这一最新指示，告诉了我们一条颠扑不破的真理：一个人不吐故纳新，他的生命就停止了；一个无产阶级政党不吐故纳新，也会停止生命。
    从我们军管单位的阶级斗争情况看，不把一些混进党内，窃踞了领导职位的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派清除出去，真正的无产阶级革命派就很难被吸收到党内来。在这个问题上，也是不破不立，只有吐故纳新，党才能朝气蓬勃。
    我们军管单位原有一个公司经理，是一个老特务。在他当权的时候，招降纳叛，结党营私，为了拼凑一个复辟资本主义的班子，他竟把两个所谓能力差的工程师和一个技术员调走，换来一个长期和他共事的国民党的残渣余孽，并且破格提升为工程师副主任，控制了全公司的工程技术大权。另外，他还收罗了许多坏人，把一些剥削阶级分子、阶级异己分子拉进党内，安排在重要岗位上。
    这一批坏家伙篡夺了党政大权，哪里还有工人的地位？！一些忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的老工人，被他们看作眼中钉、肉中刺。有的老工人写过多次申请，等了十多年，就是因为“不听话”，不合他们的口味，不能入党。对那些立场坚定，敢于坚持原则，向阶级敌人进行坚决斗争的好党员，他们就用调离的方法，千方百计地排挤出去。在这伙坏蛋把持下，整个公司党的组织搞得死气沉沉，几乎陷于瘫痪。有个别原来比较好的党员被他们腐蚀，甚至跌进了反革命修正主义的泥坑。
    无产阶级文化大革命的一声春雷，给这个公司带来了翻天覆地的变化。广大革命群众遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，通过革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍，终于把隐藏得很深的这一小撮阶级敌人挖了出来，夺回了被他们窃踞的领导大权。广大工人眉开眼笑，欢欣鼓舞，一大批真正的无产阶级造反派战士，首先是那些长期被排斥在党外的优秀的老工人，实现了或者即将实现他们多年的愿望。毛主席关于无产阶级政党要“吐故纳新”，不断吸收新鲜血液的最新指示，反映了广大工人的迫切要求，说出了工人的心里话！
    我们一定要贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，坚决清除废料，不断吸收新鲜血液。
