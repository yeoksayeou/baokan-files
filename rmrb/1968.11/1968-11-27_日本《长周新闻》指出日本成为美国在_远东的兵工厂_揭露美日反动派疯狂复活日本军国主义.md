Japan's *Chōshū Shinbun* recently published an article exposing how the reactionary forces in the U.S. and Japan are frenziedly reviving Japanese militarism. They are vigorously promoting economic militarization, turning Japan into America's "arsenal in the Far East" to serve the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' aggressive wars.

The article points out that Japan's post-war economy, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, has rapidly militarized, playing the role of the U.S. "arsenal in the Far East." It states that the foundation of Japan's economic militarization is heavy industry. U.S. imperialism fully utilizes Japan's heavy industry to maintain its hegemony in Asia.

The article points out that Japan's pro-American monopolistic capital, in the post-war period, chose the path of integrating Japan's economy into the global strategy of U.S. imperialism, relying on the U.S. to restore the Japanese economy. While U.S. imperialism forces Japan to act as the U.S.' "arsenal in the Far East," it shoulders the burden of easing U.S. aggression in the Far East, providing economic "aid" to Southeast Asia, and supplying the U.S. troops stationed in Japan and the anti-communist nations and puppet regimes allied with the U.S.

Last year at the end of the year, during the Sato-Johnson talks, a joint responsibility system was proposed. The U.S. demanded that Japan, when extending the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in 1970, should bear the responsibility of "independent defense" and defense of the Far East. Under such circumstances, Japan will accelerate the revival of militarism, and Japan's economic militarization will rapidly develop, with the armaments industry becoming a new and rapidly developing industry.

The article points out that with the progress of Japan's economic militarization, the integration of the military and industrial sectors has strengthened, forming a system where industry and the military are combined. Currently, the Japanese military is assigning generals and lieutenant generals of the "Self-Defense Forces" to major Japanese military supply companies such as "Nippon Steel," "Mitsubishi Electric," "Kawasaki Aircraft," and "Nippon Electric" to establish a system where industry and the military are combined, making factories and the military into a single command system.

The article concludes by pointing out that the economic militarization under the rule of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries means promoting the revival of militarism, intensifying the exploitation of workers, and plundering the people. This shows that the revival of militarism under the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the root of all the sufferings of the Japanese people.

    日本《长周新闻》指出日本成为美国在“远东的兵工厂”
    揭露美日反动派疯狂复活日本军国主义
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本《长周新闻》不久前刊登一篇文章揭露美日反动派正在疯狂地复活日本军国主义，极力推行经济军事化，使日本成为美国在“远东的兵工厂”，为美日反动派进行侵略战争服务。
    文章指出，战后的日本经济在美帝国主义扶植下迅速军事化，发挥着美帝在“远东的兵工厂”的作用。它说，日本经济军事化的基础是重工业。美帝国主义充分利用日本的重工业来维持美国在亚洲的统治体制。
    文章指出，日本亲美垄断资本在战后选择了这样的道路：即把日本经济纳入美帝国主义的世界战略范畴，依附于美帝国主义，并在美帝扶植下恢复日本经济。而美帝国主义则迫使日本作为美国的“远东的兵工厂”，承担着减轻美国侵略远东的负担、对东南亚的经济“援助”、对驻日美军以及同美国结盟的反共国家和傀儡集团进行供应等任务。
    去年年底，佐藤—约翰逊会谈时提出了日美联合负责体制，美国要求日本在一九七○年延长日美“安全条约”时，要承担“自主防御”和远东的防御。在这样的情况下，日本将加紧复活军国主义，日本经济军事化也将迅速发展，军火工业将作为新兴工业更加迅速发展。
    文章指出，随着日本经济军事化的进展，军事当局和产业界的结合也加强了，形成了产业和军队结合的体制。目前日本军事当局把日本“自卫队”的将级和准将级军官陆续分配到“日本制钢”、“三菱电机”、“川崎飞机”、“日本电气”等日本主要的军需生产公司，以建立产业和军队结合的体制，使工厂和军队结合成为一个指挥系统。
    文章最后指出，在美日反动派统治下进行的经济军事化意味着促进军国主义复活，加强对工人的剥削和对人民群众的搜刮。这说明，在日美“安全条约”下复活军国主义是日本人民一切痛苦的根源。
