In the spring of 1964, during the social education movement in the countryside, many production brigades in Wangjiang Commune, Pingjiang County, lacked accountants and urgently needed to cultivate culturally educated personnel to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School was established under these circumstances. Over the past four years, this school, under the management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, has trained three classes of students, totaling sixty-seven people. Among them, there are twenty-four accountants, eighteen rural health workers, and twenty-five general junior middle school students. Many students, after returning to the countryside, have taken on roles such as brigade leaders, accountants, work-point recorders, health workers, some have become propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and others have become active participants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "The students trained by the agricultural middle school are both literate and skilled, loyal to Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants welcome such young people the most."

Summarizing the experience of Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School, the following points stand out:

1. **Uphold Political Leadership, Implement Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Management of the School**

   In its early days, Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School went through a period of detours. Although the school was established based on the needs of the countryside's three great revolutions, it was unclear who should manage the school and what ideology should lead the school. Some members of the old commune party committee, due to not relying on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to run the school, not emphasizing proletarian politics, and not arming students with Mao Zedong Thought, ran the school for a few months. Parents complained, and the number of students dropped from seventeen to seven. In this situation, how to run the school attracted the attention of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In early 1965, at a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasant representatives convened by the commune, the representatives discussed this issue and decided to establish a school management committee, electing poor and lower-middle peasant representatives as committee members, with one representative each from the machine factory, agricultural technology station, health clinic, and Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School teachers participating in the committee.

   Major issues such as what classes the school should offer, who to enroll, what courses to set, when to take holidays and start school, must be discussed and decided by the committee. The committee is responsible for supervising the work of teachers, listening to the opinions of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants about the school, and recommending the selection of teachers to the commune.

   After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the school, they first removed the so-called "experienced" teachers who had always been ideologically backward and irresponsible in their work, and appointed a teacher who was of good origin, had good thoughts, and was active in work. They also proposed to the school that teaching must emphasize proletarian politics and start from the actual production of the countryside. From then on, the school began to use Chairman Mao's works (Type B edition) as political and language textbooks in its teaching.

2. **Open the School to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Combine Teaching with Practice**

   In its enrollment work, Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School thoroughly broke away from the revisionist educational line of "only looking at scores, not at people, only looking at people, not at class," and insisted on opening the school to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The students were mainly children of poor and lower-middle peasants, recommended and selected by the production brigades based on needs, without going through entrance examinations. The length of the school term was determined based on actual needs, not uniformly enforced. For example, the first class of accountants was a two-year program, the second class of health workers was a one-year program, and the third class of general middle school students was a three-year program. The fourth and fifth classes enrolled in the spring and autumn of this year are two-year programs.

   In terms of the school system, they broke away from the old school system of winter and summer vacations and changed to taking vacations during busy farming seasons. Over the years, they have basically formed a three-segment labor system, namely, "spring busy vacation," "double-crop vacation," and "autumn harvest vacation." During the vacations, students return to their brigades to participate in collective labor, and their labor performance is reviewed upon returning to school. Teachers take turns working in the production brigades. Usually, teachers and students labor in the school's tea garden for one day or half a day each week. Teachers and students do not detach themselves from production and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Due to the requirement for labor in the cultivation goals and the guarantee in the system, most students in this school can participate in about four months of collective production labor each year.

   In terms of curriculum setting and teaching, Chairman Mao's works are compulsory courses for all classes. Other courses are taught by technical personnel and old farmers on topics such as selecting seeds, dense planting, and other agricultural knowledge. Brigade accountants are invited to teach accounting courses. Health clinic staff are invited to teach health knowledge courses. Students in the health class also follow the medical staff of the health clinic to every corner of the commune to give vaccinations and preventive injections to the masses, receiving practical training in mass disease prevention and treatment work. Political classes are taught by old poor peasants telling their family histories, and students are often organized to participate in struggle meetings against enemies and visit class education exhibitions, allowing revolutionary teachers and students to be tempered in the storms of class struggle and raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

3. **Adhere to the Principle of Self-Reliance and Thrift in School Building**

   In the early days of the school's establishment, there were no school buildings. The Wangjiang Brigade vacated an old temple. Some teachers and students lacked confidence facing this situation. The committee led the teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on thrift, self-reliance, and hard struggle, and learn from the political spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, greatly boosting the confidence and courage of the teachers and students. Everyone worked together to level the classrooms, repair the doors and windows, and even turned the broken cabinets that used to hold Buddha statues into ping-pong tables. After the teachers and students' hard work, the school now has three renovated classrooms and four dormitories. The students are very happy to study in the classrooms they renovated.

   The Wangjiang Brigade allocated a total of thirty-five mu of old and new tea gardens to the school. To cultivate the tea gardens, the teachers and students carried manure up the mountain and burned lime in the valleys. Now, the two mu of old tea gardens can earn about 200 yuan a year, and the new tea gardens have also developed significantly.

   Under the great call of Chairman Mao to learn from the political spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, "self-reliance" and "hard struggle" have taken root and blossomed in the minds of the teachers and students of Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School. Whenever the school undertakes collective labor such as construction or digging tea gardens, the teachers and students eagerly participate.

   Over the past five years, Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School has adhered to self-reliance and hard struggle in school building, not only saving national expenses and cultivating new people, but more importantly, it has thoroughly broken the revisionist line of pursuing high, big, and foreign things, setting a good example for schools in the Wangjiang area.

4. **Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment, Persist in Revolutionary Criticism**

   During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call and bravely joined the battle. After the issuance of the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, all teachers and students in the school seriously studied and actively propagated them, thoroughly criticized the old and established the new, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, and launched a fierce attack on all class enemies. Over the past two years, revolutionary teachers and students, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have persistently criticized the heinous crimes of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in this region, and criticized the bourgeois educational line promoted by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. To better carry forward and inherit the revolutionary tradition, and to cultivate themselves into genuine successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the students also visited the tomb of Yang Kaihui, a revolutionary martyr, to learn from the martyrs' boundless loyalty to the revolutionary cause. After returning to school, they launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carried out the "three loyalties" activities in depth. After being tempered by the fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School is even more welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "In the struggle against the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, the agricultural middle school is the most resolute; in the struggle to resume classes and make revolution, the agricultural middle school is the best; in eliminating factionalism and achieving revolutionary great unity, the agricultural middle school is the earliest."

   Currently, under the management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Wangjiang Agricultural Middle School is further implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the proletarian educational revolution, seriously learning from the advanced experiences of various places across the country, finding gaps, making plans, and is determined to follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" to persist in the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" path, and turn the school into a grand school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

　　一所深受贫下中农欢迎的农村中学
　　——湖南省平江县瓮江农业中学调查报告
    一九六四年春天，在农村社教运动中，平江县瓮江公社很多生产队缺少会计，迫切要求培养为贫下中农服务的有文化的人材。瓮江农中就是在这种情况下办起来的。四年来，这所学校在贫下中农管理下，已先后为农村培养了三班学生，共计六十七人，其中会计二十四人，农村卫生员十八人，普通初中生二十五人。很多学生回农村后，担任了生产队的队长、会计、记工员、卫生员，有的担任了毛泽东思想宣传员，有的成为活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。贫下中农说：“农中培养的学生是既能文又能武，忠于毛主席，我们贫下中农最欢迎这样的青年。”
    总结瓮江农中办学的道路，有以下几点经验：
    一、坚持政治挂帅，实行贫下中农管理学校
    瓮江农中在开办初期，曾走过一段弯路。当时学校虽然是根据农村三大革命需要办起来的，但是由谁来管理学校，用什么思想来领导学校并不明确。旧公社党委一部分人由于没有依靠广大贫下中农办学，不突出无产阶级政治，不用毛泽东思想武装学生，搞了几个月，家长意见纷纷，学生由十七人减少到七人。在这种情况下学校怎么办，引起了广大贫下中农的注意。一九六五年初，在一次公社召开的贫下中农代表会上，贫下中农代表讨论了这个问题，决定成立学校管理委员会，推选贫下中农代表担任委员，机械厂、农技站、卫生所等单位及农中教师各一名参加管委会。
    凡学校办什么班，招收哪些人，设哪些课，什么时候放假和开学等重大问题，必须经管委会讨论决定。管委会负责监督教师的工作，听取广大贫下中农对学校的意见，并向公社建议选派教师等问题。
    贫下中农管理学校以后，首先撤换了思想一贯落后、工作一贯不负责任的所谓“有经验的教员”，选派了一名出身好、思想好、工作积极的民办教员担任教师。并且向学校提出教学必须突出无产阶级政治，从农村生产实际出发。从那时开始，学校在教学中就以毛主席著作（乙种本）作为政治和语文教材。
    二、学校向贫下中农开门，教学与实践相结合
    瓮江农中在招生工作中，彻底打破了“只看分数不看人，只看人不看阶级”的修正主义教育路线，坚持向贫下中农开门。学生主要是贫下中农子女，由大队根据需要，经贫下中农推荐选送，不再经过入学考试。学制长短从实际出发，不是强求一律。如第一班会计班是二年制，第二班卫生班是一年制，第三班普中班是三年制。今年春季和秋季招收的第四、五班是二年制。
    在教学制度方面，他们打破了旧学校放寒暑假的制度，改为放农忙假。几年来基本上形成了三段劳动制，即“春忙假”、“双抢假”和“三秋假”。假期学生回队参加集体劳动，回校要考察劳动成绩。教师则轮换到生产队劳动。平时师生每周在校内茶园劳动一天或半天。师生不脱离生产，不脱离贫下中农。由于在培养目标上对劳动有要求，在制度上有保证，这个学校大部分同学，全年能参加四个月左右的集体生产劳动。
    在课程设置和教学方面，毛主席著作是各个班的必修课。其余课程则根据设班的要求请技术员和老农讲良种、选种、密植等农业知识。请大队会计来上会计课。请卫生院的同志上卫生常识课。卫生班的同学还跟随卫生院的医务人员，到全公社的每一个角落为群众种牛痘，打预防针，受到了群众性的防病治病工作的实际锻炼。政治课请老贫农讲家史，还经常组织同学参加对敌斗争大会和参观阶级教育展览，让革命师生在阶级斗争的大风大浪中得到锻炼，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    三、坚持自力更生、勤俭建校方针
    建校初期，学校没有校舍，瓮江大队让出了一所破庙。个别教师和同学面对这个情况，信心不足。管委会领导师生反复学习了毛主席关于勤俭建国，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的指示，学习了抗大政治建校的精神，大大鼓舞了师生的信心和勇气。大家动手平教室、修门窗，还把放菩萨的破柜改成了乒乓球台。经过师生一番辛勤劳动，现在学校已修整有教室三间，住房四间。学生们坐在自己修整的教室里上课，心情很愉快。
    瓮江大队前后共拨给学校新老茶园三十五亩。为了培育茶园，师生们挑着大粪上山，到山冲里去烧火土灰……。现在二亩老茶园每年已能收入二百元左右，新茶园也有很大的发展。
    在响应毛主席伟大号召，学习抗大政治建校的口号下，“自力更生”，“艰苦奋斗”已在瓮江农中师生的思想中扎根、开花。每逢学校修建或挖茶园等集体劳动，师生个个争先恐后，踊跃参加。
    五年来，瓮江农中坚持自力更生，艰苦建校，不仅为国家节约了开支，培养了新人，更重要的是大破了追求高、大、洋的修正主义路线，为瓮江一带地区的学校作出了好榜样。
    四、紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持革命大批判
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，瓮江农中革命师生积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，勇敢地投入了战斗。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”下达后，全校师生，认真学习，积极宣传，大破四旧，大立四新，大揭阶级斗争的盖子，向一切阶级敌人猛烈开火。两年来，革命师生与广大贫下中农一起，坚持批判大叛徒刘少奇及其在本地区的代理人的滔天罪行，批判大叛徒刘少奇所推行的资产阶级教育路线。为了更好地发扬和继承革命传统，把自己培养成为真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，同学们又前往杨开慧烈士墓参观，学习革命烈士无限忠于革命事业的崇高品质。参观回校后，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，深入开展了“三忠于”活动。经过无产阶级文化大革命烈火的考验，瓮江农中更加受到广大贫下中农的欢迎。贫下中农说：“向大叛徒刘少奇和地富反坏右作斗争，农中最坚决；复课闹革命，农中最好；铲除山头，实现革命大联合，农中最早。”
    目前，瓮江农中在贫下中农的管理下，正在进一步落实毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列最新指示，认真学习全国各地的先进经验，找差距，订规划，决心沿着毛主席“五·七”指示的方向，坚持走“抗大道路”，把学校办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
