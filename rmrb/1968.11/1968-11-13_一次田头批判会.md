The communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party reached Jiawan Commune's Second Brigade in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, and the entire village was stirred. Over the past few days, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, filled with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been studying the communiqué over and over again. They have combined the serious study of the communiqué with a thorough criticism of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. Everywhere—at the village entrance, in the fields, and in the homes—revolutionary criticism battlefields have been set up. The roar of "Resolutely overthrow the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi!" echoes throughout the entire village.

On November 7, members of the eight production teams of the Second Brigade joyfully went to the fields to harvest late-season rice. Each production team set up a revolutionary criticism battlefield in the fields, and the members used their rest time to study the communiqué and severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the seventh and eighth production teams jointly held a special criticism session in the fields to criticize Liu Shaoqi's crime of severely cutting down agricultural cooperatives.

The head of the brigade's revolutionary leading group, Ye Bihong, spoke first. He said: The 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee unanimously passed a resolution to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to remove all his Party and non-Party positions. We poor and lower-middle peasants fully support this and wholeheartedly approve. Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison has deeply and widely spread in the countryside, and we must thoroughly criticize it. Today, we will severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's crime of severely cutting down agricultural cooperatives. In 1954, we responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call and established agricultural cooperatives. That year, we had a bumper grain harvest. The following year, the number of cooperative members increased from 18 households to more than 250. However, at this time, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, issued the black directive to severely cut down agricultural cooperatives, demanding that they be "resolutely reduced" within a specified period and forcing the poor and lower-middle peasants to withdraw from the cooperatives. After being cut down like this, our cooperative was reduced to only 57 households, and the collective economy was greatly weakened. Later, the great leader Chairman Mao made the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," guiding us to take the socialist road. The poor and lower-middle peasants listen most to Chairman Mao's words, and in less than a year, the cooperative developed to more than 260 households. Later, we established people's communes, and grain production increased year by year, and living standards improved year by year. Now our production is twice as much as it was during the cooperative period, every brigade has surplus grain, and the collective economy is becoming more and more consolidated and powerful. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's wise leadership, allowing Liu Shaoqi's plot to succeed, could our socialist agriculture be so powerful today? His speech deeply moved the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Overthrow the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Poor peasant Li Genxiang immediately stood up to accuse: The traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi frantically sabotaged the cooperatives, committing heinous crimes. My father worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord for more than 30 years. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, he was liberated and took the lead in joining the cooperative. When Liu Shaoqi's black directive to severely cut down cooperatives came down, his agent said our family had few laborers, few tools, and no oxen, and forced us to withdraw from the cooperative. That year, we encountered a drought, and the cooperative, with many people and strong strength, had a bumper grain harvest, while we, having withdrawn from the cooperative, had reduced production. Liu Shaoqi wanted us poor and lower-middle peasants to take the capitalist black road and suffer twice. Now that Liu Shaoqi has been overthrown forever, the biggest obstacle for us poor and lower-middle peasants on the socialist road has been removed. We must forever follow Chairman Mao and march forward bravely on the socialist road for life!

Li Genxiang spoke the words in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and many of them spoke up. One after another, they praised the superiority of the collective economy, extolled Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes of severely cutting down cooperatives and promoting the "three freedoms and one contract" black goods.

The field criticism session ended. The poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" They solemnly vowed to Chairman Mao, "We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line!"

　　一次田头批判会
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报传到浙江省金华县雅畈公社二村大队，整个村庄沸腾起来了。连日来，广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，一遍又一遍地学习公报，并且把认真学习公报和狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇结合起来，村头、地头、家庭到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。“坚决打倒大叛徒刘少奇”的怒吼声，响彻了整个村庄。
    十一月七日，二村大队八个生产队的社员兴高采烈地下田收割晚稻。各个生产队都在田头摆开了革命大批判的战场，社员们利用劳动休息时间一面学习公报，一面狠批刘少奇的反革命罪行。第七和第八生产队的贫下中农联合召开了专题批判刘少奇大砍农业合作社的田头批判会。
    大队革命领导小组负责人叶碧荣首先发言。他说：党的八届十二中全会一致通过决议把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消他党内外的一切职务，我们贫下中农一千个拥护，一万个赞成。刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，在农村里流毒很深很广，我们一定要彻底批判。今天我们就要狠狠批判刘少奇大砍农业合作社的罪行。一九五四年，我们响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，办起了农业合作社，当年粮食获得大丰收。第二年合作社社员由十八户发展到二百五十多户。可是就在这个时候，党内头号走资派刘少奇却下了大砍农业合作社的黑指示，限期要“坚决收缩”合作社，强迫贫下中农退社。被他这样一砍，我们的合作社只剩下五十七户，集体经济大大削弱了。后来，伟大领袖毛主席作了《关于农业合作化问题》的报告，指引我们走社会主义道路。贫下中农最听毛主席的话，不到一年，合作社又发展到二百六十多户，以后又办起了人民公社，粮食年年增产，生活年年提高。现在我们的产量比合作社时翻了两番，队队有余粮，集体经济越来越巩固壮大。要不是有毛主席英明领导，让刘少奇的阴谋得逞，我们社会主义农业能有今天这样强大吗？他的发言使贫下中农深深激动，他们连连振臂高呼：“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！” 
    贫农李根相紧接着站起来控诉说：叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇疯狂破坏合作社，罪恶滔天。我父亲给地主扛了三十多年长工，在毛主席领导下翻了身，带头参加了合作社。刘少奇大砍合作社的黑指示一下来，他的代理人就说我家劳力少，农具少，又没有耕牛，强迫我们退了社。那一年，碰到旱灾，合作社人多力量大，粮食得到大丰收，而我们退了社，就减了产。刘少奇就是要我们贫下中农走资本主义黑路，要我们贫下中农重受二遍苦。现在刘少奇被永远打倒了，我们贫下中农走社会主义道路最大的绊脚石被搬掉了。我们一定要永远紧跟毛主席，一辈子在社会主义的道路上奋勇前进！
    李根相说出了贫下中农的心里话，许多贫下中农纷纷发言。你一言，我  一语，大摆集体经济的优越性，大颂毛主席的英明领导，狠批刘少奇大砍合作社和推行“三自一包”等黑货的反革命罪行。
    田头批判会结束了。贫下中农们不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
  一次又一次敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！他们向毛主席庄严宣誓，我们永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的革命路线！
