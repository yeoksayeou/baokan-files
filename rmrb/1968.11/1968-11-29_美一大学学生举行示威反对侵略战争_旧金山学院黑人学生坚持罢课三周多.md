	Washington, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) - Hundreds of students at Connecticut University staged a demonstration on Nov. 26 to protest against the recruitment of personnel by a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression.

	Students at this university have staged demonstrations on several occasions to oppose the recruitment of personnel by the Dow Chemical Company, which manufactures napalm bombs for the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam, and the Oliver-Mason Company, which manufactures munitions. On Nov. 26, the munitions manufacturer was scheduled to go to the university to "select" students. The reactionary school authorities, fearing the students' growing struggle, had sent many thugs armed with clubs to guard the entrance of the building where the munitions manufacturer's representative was to "talk" to the students. Despite the threat of force, hundreds of demonstrators, shouting anti-war slogans, rushed towards the building's entrance and engaged in a fierce struggle with the authorities' thugs. The students also threw stones, breaking the building's windows. The school authorities called in more police to strengthen the repression, and arbitrarily arrested 12 demonstrators.

	At San Francisco City College in California, black students, with the support of white students and some faculty members, have been on strike for more than three weeks. Recently, black students have put forward demands to oppose racial discrimination and to guarantee the democratic rights of students and teachers to go on strike and teach-in. Faced with the unyielding struggle of the black students, the college president was forced to resign on Nov. 26.

    美一大学学生举行示威反对侵略战争
    旧金山学院黑人学生坚持罢课三周多
    新华社二十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国康涅狄格大学的数百名学生二十六日举行示威，抗议军火制造公司派人到这所学校去招募人员为美帝国主义的侵略战争服务。
    这所大学的学生曾经多次举行示威，反对为侵越战争制造凝固汽油弹的道氏化学公司和制造军火的奥林马锡森公司前去招募人员。二十六日，军火制造商预定又要到这所学校去“物色”学生。反动学校当局害怕学生们不断高涨的斗争，事先派了许多打手拿着棍棒守卫在军火商代表要找学生“谈话”的楼房门口。数百名示威学生，不顾武力镇压的威胁，高呼着反对侵略战争的口号向楼房门口冲了过去，同当局的打手进行了一场激烈的搏斗。学生们还扔石块打碎楼房的窗户。学校当局增调了许多警察去加强镇压，无理逮捕了十二名示威者。
    在加利福尼亚州州立旧金山学院，黑人学生在白人学生和一些教职员的支持下，已经坚持罢课斗争三周多。最近，黑人学生提出了反对种族歧视以及保证学生和教师举行罢课罢教的民主权利等要求。学院院长在黑人学生不屈不挠的斗争面前束手无策，已经在二十六日被迫辞职。
