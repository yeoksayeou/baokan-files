We have read the suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu that public primary schools should be managed by production brigades, as well as the editorial note from the *People's Daily*. Our hearts are filled with excitement. This suggestion expresses the sentiments of hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. It provides excellent measures for further implementing Chairman Mao's wise directive that "the poor and lower-middle peasants should manage the schools." This initiative is excellent.

We deeply feel that it is good for public primary schools to be managed by production brigades. It is good because it breaks the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals, firmly placing the power of culture in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. It fundamentally changes the phenomenon of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat vying for control of the schools, ushering in a new era where primary schools cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. It is good because such schools, managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, teach classes on class struggle and production struggle, spread Mao Zedong Thought, and cultivate the feelings of the laboring people, making education truly serve proletarian politics and integrate education with productive labor. It banishes all the junk of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into the dustbin of history. It is good because such schools open their doors to the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, giving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' children the opportunity to attend school.

However, due to the influence of old habits in society and because some teachers who came from old schools still have some "selfish" thoughts in their minds, the production brigade party branch and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants must follow Chairman Mao's latest directives, address living thoughts, and provide sincere and warm assistance to these teachers. They must do meticulous and patient ideological and political work to help them fully realize that this is not just about one person or simply a matter of saving or not saving. It is about which path teachers should take; it is about whether the political power can forever remain in the hands of the proletariat, whether people will not change their nature, and whether the country will not become revisionist. The attitude one takes towards this new thing is also a test of whether one is a true revolutionary or a half-hearted revolutionary, or even a fake revolutionary.

　　这是教师走什么路的大问题
    我们看了侯振民、王庆余二同志提的公办小学由大队办的建议和《人民日报》的编者按，心情非常激动。这个建议说出了亿万贫下中农的心里话，代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，对进一步落实毛主席“贫下中农管理学校”的英明指示，提出了很好的措施，这个倡议好得很。
    我们深深感到：公办小学由大队办就是好。好就好在它打破了资产阶级知识分子独霸的一统天下，把文权牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里，从根本上改变了资产阶级与无产阶级争夺学校领导权的现象，使小学开始了为无产阶级革命事业培养接班人的新时代。好就好在这样的学校由贫下中农管理，上的是阶级斗争、生产斗争课，讲的是毛泽东思想，培养的是劳动人民的感情，使教育真正为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，把一切封、资、修的货色，统统扫进了历史的垃圾堆。好就好在这样的学校为贫下中农子女开门，使广大贫下中农的子女都有了上学的机会。
    但是，由于在社会上还存在着旧的习惯势力的影响，由于有些从旧学校出来的教师，头脑里还有一些“私”字，所以大队党支部和广大贫下中农必须遵照毛主席的最新指示，抓好活思想，对这些教师进行热情而诚恳的帮助，做好耐心细致的思想政治工作，使他们充分认识到：这样做不是那一个人的事，也不光是节约不节约的问题，而是教师走什么路的问题；是关系到政权能否永远掌握在无产阶级手里，人不变质，国家不变修的大问题。对待这样一个新生事物抱什么态度，也是考验一个人是真革命还是半截革命甚至假革命的试金石。
