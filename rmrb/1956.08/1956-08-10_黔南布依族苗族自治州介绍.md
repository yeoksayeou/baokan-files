Introduction to the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
Xinhua News Agency reporter Wu Zhenquan

	Qiannan is a good place, with high mountains and long rivers,
	Thirty thousand square miles, everywhere with treasures;
	Since the people became masters, the villages and towns have changed,
	Building railways and factories, red flags are flying everywhere in the competition;
	All ethnic groups work together to turn their hometown into paradise.

This is a song sung by the Buyi, Miao, Han, and other ethnic youths in Duyun County, where the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee is located. This song summarizes the new face of the rapid economic development of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and expresses the strong will and revolutionary heroism of the people of all ethnic groups in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in carrying out socialist construction.

The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southern part of Guizhou Province, close to the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and bordering the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. It includes twelve counties including Duyun, Dushan, Pingtang, Sandu, Libo, Changshun, Anlong, Ceheng, Wangmo, Zhenfeng, Ziyun, and Zhenning, and the Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Huishui Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, Yangchang Buyi and Miao Autonomous Region of Longli County, Gaogong Miao Autonomous Region of Guizhu County, and Liuma Buyi settlement area of Guanling County. The area is approximately over 30,000 square kilometers, with a population of over 1,949,000, including over 811,000 Buyi people, over 233,000 Miao people, over 123,000 Shui people, over 6,000 Yao people, and over 1,000 each of Yi, Hui, and Dong people, and over 764,000 Han people.

In the Autonomous Prefecture, all ethnic groups have certain concentrated and mixed residential areas. The center of the Buyi people's residence is Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Zhenfeng and Wangmo counties, and Huishui Buyi and Miao Autonomous County and Ceheng County also have large areas of concentrated and mixed residences. The center of the Miao people's residence is Huishui Buyi and Miao Autonomous County and Ziyun County. The center of the Shui people's residence is Libo and Sandu counties. The center of the Yao people's residence is parts of Libo and Wangmo counties. The remaining areas are mostly Han people's residences.

The natural scenery of the Autonomous Prefecture is beautiful and moving. In the vast mountainous area, there are many majestic peaks. The famous Huangguoshu Waterfall is located in Zhenning County within this Autonomous Prefecture. Its terrain slopes from northwest to southeast. The branches of the Miaoling Mountains stretch across the entire territory. The Duliu River, Pan River, Lian River, Zhang River, Jian River, and other rivers run through the mountains. In the high mountain areas, dense fir, pine, and oak trees grow. In the low-lying valleys and plains, rainfall is abundant, the soil is fertile, and the climate is warm and humid, producing rice, corn, beans, rapeseed, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and jute, as well as tung oil, gallnuts, borneol, and other local products. The production of food crops in the Autonomous Prefecture in 1955 increased by more than one-third compared to 1950. The production of rapeseed, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, jute and other crops in 1955 increased by one to thirteen times compared to 1950.

The Autonomous Prefecture is rich in underground mineral resources. More than ten types, including iron, manganese, lead, antimony, silver, mercury, and coal, have been discovered. In the past few years, the Autonomous Prefecture has newly built and expanded thirty-seven local state-owned industrial enterprises, including agricultural tool manufacturing, pig iron smelting, leather making, and paper making. Among them, the Duyun Leather Factory, which produces more than 50,000 pairs of leather shoes annually, is currently the larger leather factory in Guizhou Province. The Duyun Paper Mill, which produces 80,000 rolls of wax paper and more than 40 tons of white paper annually, is the only factory in Guizhou Province that can manufacture wax paper.

The cultural, educational, and health work of the Autonomous Prefecture has also developed rapidly. There are now more than 2,800 students in middle schools and normal schools, and more than 96,000 primary school students. This is also a transportation hub in Guizhou Province leading to Guangxi Province. The Qian-Gui Highway crosses the Dushan and Duyun county boundaries of the Autonomous Prefecture, and the Qian-Gui Railway will also pass through here. Currently, tens of thousands of farmers of all ethnic groups are actively supporting the construction of the Qian-Gui Railway.

The Autonomous Prefecture has now basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. (Attached picture)

To celebrate the establishment of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, central representatives and the Guizhou Provincial delegation came to Duyun. At the welcoming meeting, Wu Dexiang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, toasted Sa Kongliao, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, with a native ethnic custom.

    黔南布依族苗族自治州介绍
    新华社记者　吴振全
    黔南地方好，山高水又长，
    方圆三万里，处处有宝藏；
    自从人民当家后，乡村城镇变了样，
    修铁路办工厂，竞赛红旗处处扬；
    各族人民齐动手，要把家乡变天堂。
    这是黔南布依族苗族自治州人民委员会所在地——都匀县的布依、苗、汉等各族青年男女唱的一首歌子。这个歌子概述了黔南布依族苗族自治州当前经济建设迅速发展的新面貌，表达了黔南布依族苗族自治州各族人民进行社会主义建设的坚强意志和革命的英雄气概。
    黔南布依族苗族自治州位于贵州省南部，紧靠黔东南苗族侗族自治州，并和桂西僮族自治州接壤，包括都匀、独山、平塘、三都、荔波、长顺、安龙、册亨、望谟、贞丰、紫云、镇宁等十二县和罗甸布依族自治县，惠水布依族苗族自治县，龙里县羊场布依族苗族自治区，贵筑县高供苗族自治区，关岭县六马布依族聚居区，面积约有三万多平方公里，一百九十四万九千多人，其中布依族八十一万一千多人，苗族二十三万三千多人，水家族一十二万三千多人，瑶族六千多人，彝族回族和侗族各一千多人，汉族七十六万四千多人。
    自治州内，各族人民都有一定的聚居区和杂居区。布依族聚居的中心是罗甸布依族自治县、贞丰和望谟三县，惠水布依族苗族自治县和册亨县也有大块的聚居区和杂居区。苗族聚居的中心是惠水布依族苗族自治县和紫云县。水家族聚居的中心是荔波和三都县。瑶族聚居的中心是荔波和望谟两县的部分地区。其余地区大都是汉族聚居区。
    自治州自然风光美丽动人，在辽阔的山区中，有许多气魄雄伟的山峰，著名的黄果树瀑布，就在这个自治州的镇宁县境内。它的地势由西北向东南倾斜，苗岭山脉的支脉盘亘全境，都柳江、盘江、涟江、漳江、剑水等江河纵贯群山之间。高山地区，生长着茂密的杉、松、青杠等树木。低洼的山谷平坝地带，雨水充沛，土地肥沃，气候温热，盛产水稻、玉米、豆类、油菜、烤烟、甘蔗和青麻等作物，和桐油、五棓子、冰片等土产特产。自治州粮食作物生产，1955年的产量比1950年增加了三分之一以上，油菜、烤烟、甘蔗、青麻等作物，1955年的产量比1950年增加一倍到十三倍。
    自治州地下矿藏丰富，现在已经发现的有铁、锰、铅、锑、银、汞、煤等十多种。几年来，自治州先后新建和扩建了农具制造、生铁冶炼、制革、造纸等地方国营工业企业三十七个。其中年产五万多双皮鞋的都匀制革厂，是贵州省目前较大的制革厂。年产八万筒腊纸和四十多吨白皮纸的都匀造纸厂，是贵州省仅有的一个能制造腊纸的工厂。
    自治州的文教卫生工作也迅速发展起来，现在有中学和师范学校学生二千八百多人，小学生九万六千多人。这里还是贵州省通向广西省的交通要道，黔桂公路横穿自治州的独山和都匀县境，黔桂铁路也将在这里穿过。目前数以万计的各族农民，正在积极支援黔桂铁路的修建工程。
    现在自治州已经基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。（附图片）
    为庆祝黔南布依族苗族自治州成立，中央代表和贵州省代表团来到了都匀。在欢迎大会上，黔南布依族苗族自治州筹委会副主任委员吴德祥以本民族礼节向中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任萨空了敬酒。
