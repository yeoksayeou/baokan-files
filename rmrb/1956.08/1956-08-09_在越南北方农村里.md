A Bumper Harvest

In northern Vietnam, a bumper harvest of summer rice and other crops is generally expected this year. This is the third bumper harvest in the two years since the Democratic Republic of Vietnam restored peace. Thanks to the continuous success of agricultural production, the periodic famine that occurred every year in the history of northern Vietnam has been overcome.

According to statistics, the cultivated area of summer rice in northern Vietnam this year exceeded the original plan by 3.1%, and the output exceeded 13.54%; the cultivated area of ​​corn exceeded the original plan by 21.3%, and the output exceeded 13%; the cultivated area of ​​sweet potatoes exceeded the original plan by 29%, and the output exceeded 63%; the cotton cultivation area also exceeded the original plan, increasing by 29.63%, which is much larger than the highest index before the war.

It is Good to Organize

Land reform has been basically realized in the rural areas of northern Vietnam, and the enthusiasm of farmers who have been liberated from the feudal exploitation system is extremely high. Activists in rural areas were the first to demand organization for production, and many mutual aid work exchange teams emerged.

The Nguyen Van Manh work exchange team in the rural suburbs of Haiphong is one such mutual aid work exchange team. The Nguyen Van Manh work exchange team was only established at the end of March this year, but it quickly demonstrated its advantages. One of the members, Nguyen Thi Hue, a farm laborer, had a poor family and a small population. She planted two fen of rice paddies and some cornfields. In the past, she often had to work short-term jobs due to lack of food, leaving her fields barren. Since she joined the work exchange team, these difficulties have been resolved. Now, not only are the crops in the fields growing well, but she also earns work points through work exchange, so she doesn't have to worry about food during the lean season. During the spring plowing this year, ordinary individual farmers could only apply three dan of fertilizer per fen of land, while the Nguyen Van Manh work exchange team applied seventeen dan of fertilizer. When planting corn, Nguyen Van Manh adopted the method of auxiliary pollination, resulting in a harvest of 120 kilograms of corn per fen of land, while individual farmers only harvested 30 to 40 kilograms per fen of land.

New Record for Sweet Potato Production

Nguyen Dai Hy, an old farmer in Nam Giang Township, Nam Truc District, Nam Dinh Province, created the highest record for sweet potato production this year. In the past, the most sweet potatoes harvested in this area was 220 kilograms per fen of land. After the land reform, farmers applied more fertilizer, and 300 kilograms could be harvested per fen of land. However, Nguyen Dai Hy harvested 1,100 kilograms on his one and a half fen of sweet potato land. This old farmer, who was liberated during the land reform, told visitors, "The secret is all in these hands." Then, he introduced his experience of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation to everyone in detail. He said, "This method is very time-consuming, but I think you won't have a good harvest if you try to save effort, so I work hard to do it."

Challenge in Autumn Cultivation

The Deng Ding Sinh work exchange team of Hung Son Commune, Dai Tu District, Thai Nguyen Province, one of the oldest work exchange teams in northern Vietnam, recently challenged work exchange teams across the country, with the goal of improving cultivation techniques, increasing autumn rice production, and overfulfilling the national production increase plan for 1956. The specific conditions are: the average yield of autumn rice per mu this year must reach 928 kilograms, an increase of 208 kilograms compared to last year's autumn rice. Therefore, the Deng Ding Sinh work exchange team guarantees that all types of fields must be plowed three to five times during the autumn cultivation, and 60 to 70 dan of fertilizer and 100 kilograms of phosphate fertilizer must be applied per mu of land, and advanced methods such as warm water seed soaking and single-plant close planting must be implemented. In addition, two mu of wasteland will be reclaimed to plant bananas, coconuts, etc., and a pond will be dug to raise fish to increase income.

Many local work exchange teams have accepted the challenge of the Deng Ding Sinh work exchange team. The famous Trinh Xuan Bai work exchange team and Nguyen The Khuong work exchange team in Thanh Hoa province have also put forward specific counter-challenge conditions. The Trinh Xuan Bai work exchange team guarantees that the average harvest of autumn rice per mu this year will be 1,800 kilograms, an increase of 340 kilograms compared to last year's autumn rice. (The mu mentioned above is the North Vietnamese mu, each mu is approximately equal to more than five mu in our country.)

    在越南北方农村里
    五谷丰登
    在越南北方，今年夏稻和其他农作物普遍丰收。这是越南民主共和国在和平恢复两年来第三次大丰收。由于农业生产连续的胜利，越南北方历史上每年一度的周期性的饥荒已经克服了。
    据统计：越南北方今年夏稻耕种面积超过原计划3.1％，产量超过13.54％；玉米耕种面积超过原计划21.3％，产量超过13％；红薯耕种面积超过原计划29％，产量超过63％；棉花耕种面积也超过原计划，增加了29.63％，比战前最高的指数要大得多。
    组织起来好处多
    越南北方农村基本上实现了土地改革，从封建剥削制度下解放出来的农民生产情绪异常高涨。农村里的积极分子首先要求组织起来进行生产，许多互助换工小组随着出现了。
    海防市郊区农村阮文孟换工组，就是属于这类互助换工小组的一个。阮文孟换工组今年三月底才成立，很快就显示出它的优越性。组里有个雇农阮氏慧，家底差，人口又少，她种着两分稻田和一些玉米地，过去常因为缺少口粮去打短工，只好让自己的田地荒着；自从她参加了换工组，这些困难都得到了解决，现在不仅田里的庄稼长得很好，而且因为换工挣了工分，在青黄不接时也不愁没有粮食吃了。今年春耕的时候，一般单干户农民每分田只能施三担肥料，阮文孟换工组却施了十七担肥料。种植玉米的时候，阮文孟采取了辅助授粉法，结果每分地收获玉米一百二十公斤，而单干农民每分地只收三十到四十公斤。
    红薯丰产新纪录
    南定省南直县南江乡有一位老农民阮大禧，他今年创造了红薯丰产的最高纪录。过去这一带种的红薯，一分地最多收二百二十公斤；土地改革后，农民多施肥，每分地可收三百公斤；可是在阮大禧的一分半红薯地上，却收获了一千一百公斤。这位在土地改革中翻身的老农民对去访问他的人说：“秘密全在这双手上。”然后，他便把自己深耕细作的经验一五一十地介绍给大家，他说：“这样做法是很费工夫的，但是我想图省劲是不会有好收成的，因此我努力去做。”
    秋耕中的挑战
    越南北方最老的换工组之一——太原省大慈县雄山社邓丁生换工组，不久前向全国各地换工组提出挑战，以改进耕作技术、提高秋稻产量、超额完成1956年国家增产计划为目标。具体条件是：今年秋稻每亩平均产量要达到928公斤，比去年秋稻增产208公斤。因此，邓丁生换工组保证秋耕时各类田地必须犁三遍到五遍，每亩田施六十至七十担肥料和一百公斤磷肥，并且实行温汤浸种和单株密植等先进方法。此外，还开垦两亩荒地种植香蕉、椰子等，挖一个池塘养鱼，以增加收入。
    许多地方的换工组已经接受了邓丁生换工组的挑战。有名的清化省郑春拜换工组和阮世羌换工组也都提出了具体的应战条件。郑春拜换工组保证今年秋稻每亩平均收获1，800公斤，比去年秋稻增产340公斤。（按以上所说的亩是北越亩，每亩约等于我国五亩多。）
