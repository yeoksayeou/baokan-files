    Beijing Artists and Mexican Artists
    Discuss Mexican Figurative Art
    (Our Newspaper) On the morning of August 8th, over thirty Beijing artists held a pleasant discussion with the Mexican artist Aguirre Ignacio, from the Mexican National Front of Plastic Arts. The meeting took place in the hall of the "Mexican National Front of Plastic Arts Oil Painting and Print Exhibition," where Ignacio introduced the situation of the Mexican progressive art movement and the experience of mural creation with a long tradition. The Chinese artists present were greatly interested. The painter Situ Qiao expressed his thoughts on this Mexican art exhibition, expressing a common feeling: Mexican progressive art has extremely strong expressiveness, with a distinct national style, and it is closely combined with the lives and struggles of the people. Chinese audiences, especially Chinese artists, will be deeply sympathetic and greatly encouraged by the heroic and arduous struggle of the Mexican people through this exhibition.
