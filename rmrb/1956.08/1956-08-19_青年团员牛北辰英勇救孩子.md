    Youth League Member Niu Beichen Heroically Saves Children
    (Our report) This newspaper reports that during the celebration of "August 1st" Army Day, a certain unit stationed in Dandong City, Liaoning Province, rewarded Niu Beichen, a telephone soldier and Youth League member, for heroically rescuing three children from danger in front of a train.
    At 5:00 PM on July 23rd, the cries of children startled Niu Beichen, who was inspecting the telephone line installation competition beside the railway. He turned around and saw a train rushing towards them, and three children playing on the railway were crying in fear. The train was only about fifty meters away from the children. In that extremely dangerous moment, Niu Beichen jumped onto the railway without hesitation, picked up a child who had just learned to crawl with one hand, and pulled two children who were only five or six years old with the other. Just as he strode out of the railway track, the train sped past behind him. Niu Beichen's brave act saved the lives of three children.

    青年团员牛北辰英勇救孩子
    本报讯　驻辽宁安东市某部队在纪念“八一”建军节的大会上，奖励了英勇地从火车前抢救三个孩子脱险的电话兵、青年团员牛北辰。
    七月二十三日下午五时，一阵小孩的哭声惊动了正在铁路旁参观电话线路架设竞赛的牛北辰。他回头一看，一列火车已迎面飞驰而来，三个在铁路上玩的孩子吓得大哭。眼看火车离小孩只剩五十公尺左右了。在这万分危急的一刹那，牛北辰毫不犹豫地跳上铁路，一手抱起一个刚学会爬的小孩，一手拉着两个才五、六岁的孩子，当他大步跨出铁轨时，火车就在他的背后疾驰而过。牛北辰勇敢的行为保全了三个孩子的生命。
