Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 27th. Recently, a valuable mineral needed for oil drilling – barite – has been discovered near Xitieshan in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai. The newly discovered barite deposit has a vein length of six kilometers and a thickness of about half a meter. After preliminary identification by geological engineers from Team 632 of the Northwest Geological Bureau, it is considered a relatively good barite vein. They immediately created a preliminary survey map. During the reconnaissance work for creating this preliminary survey map, geological personnel discovered several similar veins in the vicinity. Currently, Team 632 of the Northwest Geological Bureau has dispatched a detachment to conduct a detailed survey in this area, preparing to clarify the thickness and distribution range of these veins in a short period of time, and also preparing to extract ore from the discovered veins for testing.

The drilling mud used in oil drilling is made by grinding barite into powder, and a large amount is required during drilling. In recent years, the large amount of barite used in oil exploration areas in Northwest China has had to be transported from very far away. The discovery of barite deposits in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai, near the area where oil is being drilled, has great economic value.

The mine was initially discovered by a student from the Beijing Institute of Geology who was interning here.

    柴达木盆地发现重晶石矿
    新华社西宁27日电　最近在青海柴达木盆地的锡铁山附近，发现了一种石油钻井需用的贵重矿石——重晶石，新发现的重晶石矿的矿脉长六公里、厚约半公尺。经西北地质局六三二队地质工程师初步鉴定，认为是一种较好的重晶石矿脉。他们立即制作了草测图。在制作这个草测图的踏勘工作中，地质人员在邻近又发现了同样的矿脉数条。目前，西北地质局六三二队已经派出一个分队，在这个地区进行详细的勘测，准备在短时间内弄清这些矿脉的厚薄和分布范围，并且准备在已发现的矿脉中，提取矿石进行化验。
    钻探石油所用的泥浆，都是用重晶石磨成粉制成的，钻井时需用量很大。近几年在西北各地石油探区所用的大量重晶石，要从很远的地方运来。目前在青海柴达木盆地钻探石油的邻近地区找到重晶石矿，它的经济价值很大。
    这个矿最初是由一个到这里来实习的北京地质学院的学生发现的。
