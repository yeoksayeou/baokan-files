Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 10th. Sharma, the head of the Nepalese Cultural Delegation visiting China, held a press conference at the Ai Qun Mansion in Guangzhou today, answering questions raised by Guangzhou reporters.

When a reporter asked Delegation Head Sharma to talk about his impressions during his visit to China, he said, "During our visit to China, we particularly noticed the Chinese people's love for their motherland and their desire for peace. We also noticed the characteristics of the leaders of great China, the humility, sincerity, gentleness, and the style of mixing with ordinary people that they displayed, which we have never seen before."

When a reporter asked him how he felt about the Chinese people's love for peace, he said, "We remember that at a reception held by Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier Zhou expressed his willingness to invite a group of American journalists to visit China. Some people at the time expressed doubts about the effect of this invitation. Premier Zhou replied that our purpose in inviting them to China was to let them see what we are actually doing, and it doesn't matter how they report it after they go back." Sharma said that this not only fully reflects the humility of Chinese political leaders, but also reflects the Chinese people's love for peace. He also said that in Beijing, I lived in the same hotel with a foreign journalist group visiting China, and I saw that their actions were not restricted in any way. They could go wherever they wanted and ask whatever they wanted. He said that China does not repay slanderous propaganda with slanderous propaganda, but rather shows others the facts, not by pulling up curtains, but by opening doors.

When talking about developing friendship and cultural exchange between China and Nepal, he believes that the most important thing for developing friendship and promoting cultural exchange is whether the two countries have a consistent view on their own national construction. He said: "I have discovered that our two countries are consistent in many ways: the people of both countries love their motherland, and both have the desire to build their own countries by relying on their own efforts. They sympathize with countries whose level of construction is not as good as their own, and express their willingness to help others improve. At the same time, they all have an absolute desire for peace." He said that he places great hope on these common points.

Then, the reporter asked him to talk about his opinions on Chinese culture and art. He said, "I deeply admire the high level of development in your culture and art. Every country has its own characteristics and cultural and artistic traditions. China is like a garden where a hundred flowers bloom. I see that the culture and art of the Han nationality has not been imposed on the minority nationalities. I am very happy to see that China has spent a lot of effort in developing the culture and art of the minority nationalities, so that their traditions can be preserved." In answering reporters' questions, he expressed his appreciation for the combination of ancient Chinese culture and modern culture, especially in architectural art and drama.

As the press conference was coming to an end, Head Sharma said excitedly: "I have personally seen the great enthusiasm that your country embodies in its construction, and I have also personally seen the Chinese people leading their motherland to a better state. I know you are engaged in a great cause, building a new China on the ruins of the old China. Therefore, I take this opportunity to assure you on behalf of the Nepalese people that you have a friendly neighbor, which regards your progress with great concern and extreme admiration. Therefore, I ask us all to work together, so that Asia can regain its past glory." He expressed his gratitude for the friendly reception the delegation received during its visit to China. He said:
  "When we were in China, we felt that we were not living among a group of strangers, but as if we were back in our own home."

Finally, he said that the Chinese Ministry of Culture has agreed to Nepal's invitation and is preparing to send a Chinese cultural delegation to visit Nepal. The Nepalese people and members of the delegation are very happy to hear this news. He asked the reporters to convey the greetings and thanks of all members of the delegation and the Nepalese people to the Chinese people.

    尼泊尔文化代表团在广州举行记者招待会
    新华社广州10日电　尼泊尔访华文化代表团团长夏尔马，今天在广州爱群大厦举行记者招待会，回答了广州市新闻记者提出的一些问题。
    当记者提出请代表团团长夏尔马谈谈他在访华期间的观感的时候，他说：“在中国访问期间，我们特别注意到中国人民所具有的热爱祖国和热爱和平的愿望。也注意到伟大中国的领袖们的特点，他们所表现的谦虚、诚恳、温和以及和普通人打成一片的作风，是我们所没有看到过的。”
    当记者问到他对中国人民热爱和平有什么感觉的时候，他说：“我们记得，在一次周恩来总理举行的酒会上，周恩来总理表示准备邀请一个美国记者团来中国访问。当中有人对这个邀请的效果曾表示怀疑。当时周恩来总理答复说，我们邀请他们来中国的目的，是要他们来看看我们实在做些什么，至于他们回去后怎样报道，这是没有什么关系的。”夏尔马说，这就不仅充分体现了中国政治领袖的谦虚，而且也体现了中国人民是热爱和平的。他又说，在北京，我和一个正在中国访问的外国记者团住在一个旅馆里，我看到他们的行动没有受到什么限制，他们要到那里就到那里，要问什么就问什么。他说，中国不是以污蔑性的宣传来回报污蔑性宣传的，而是拿事实给别人看，不是拉起帐幕，而是打开大门。
    在谈到发展中尼两国的友谊和文化交流时，他认为发展友谊和促进文化交流最重要的是两国对自己国家的建设是否抱有一致的看法。他说：我已发现我们两国在许多方面都是一致的：两国的人民都热爱自己的祖国，并且都有依靠自己的努力来建设自己国家的愿望，对建设水平不及自己的国家都给予同情，并表示要帮助别人提高，同时都具有要求和平的绝对愿望。他说，他对这些共同之点寄予很大希望。
    接着，记者请他谈谈他对中国文化艺术方面的意见。他说：“我深深赞扬你们文化艺术方面的高度发展，每个国家都有自己的特点和文化艺术传统。中国就好像一个百花齐放的花园一样。我看到汉族的文化艺术并没有强加于少数民族的身上，我很高兴看到中国花了很大力量在发展少数民族的文化艺术，而使他们的传统保存下来。”他在回答记者问题时，对中国古代文化和现代文化的结合表示赞扬，特别表现在建筑艺术和戏剧方面。
    当记者招待会快要结束的时候，夏尔马团长很兴奋地说：“我亲眼看到你们国家在建设中所体现出来的巨大的热情，我也亲眼看到中国人民把自己的祖国带到更美好的境界。我知道你们正在从事着一件伟大的事业，在旧中国的废墟上建立起一个新中国。因此我趁此机会代表尼泊尔人民，保证你们有一个友好的邻邦。它对你们的进步抱着极大的关心和极度赞扬的感情。因此我要求我们大家一起来工作，这样亚洲才能重新获得过去的光辉。”他对代表团在中国访问期间所获得的友谊的接待表示感谢。他说：
  “当我们在中国期间，我们感觉到不是生活在一群陌生人的中间，而是像回到自己的家庭里一样。”
    最后他说，中国文化部已经答应了尼泊尔的邀请，准备派遣一个中国文化代表团到尼泊尔访问。尼泊尔人民和代表团的团员们非常高兴听到这个消息。他要求记者们转达代表团全体团员和尼泊尔人民对中国人民的问候和谢意。
