Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The Higher Normal Schools Literature and History Teaching Syllabus Discussion Meeting, entrusted by the Ministry of Education and hosted by Beijing Normal University, examined and approved twenty kinds of teaching syllabuses for literature and history departments from August 6th to 18th.

    During the discussion of the Chinese literature teaching syllabus, teachers specifically discussed the characteristics that a syllabus for higher normal schools should have. Considering the training objectives, the teachers specifically increased the introduction and analysis of literary works from various eras in the syllabus.

    At the discussion meeting, the historical periodization of classical and modern Chinese literature sparked debate. For example, some people believed that Tang Dynasty literature should be divided according to the traditional early Tang, High Tang, mid-Tang, and late Tang periods, while the majority argued that Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties literature should be divided into two periods, early and late, in order to discuss writers and works. Regarding modern Chinese literature, some advocated dividing it into three periods, while others advocated dividing it into five periods.

    Regarding the discussion of grammatical definitions in modern Chinese, the vast majority of professors agreed that grammar is a synthesis of the rules of word change and the rules of using words to form sentences. However, some professors expressed doubt about this definition, believing that word-form change cannot be used to replace morphology in Chinese, while morphology can include word-form change. He believed that grammar is the rule of morphology and the rule of using words to form sentences. This argument was not accepted by most representatives. The symposium included his opinion in the appendix of the syllabus.

    The teaching syllabus for ancient and medieval Chinese history first discussed the issue of periodization. Teachers had many different opinions on the internal periodization of feudal society. One view advocated dividing feudal society into four stages: formation, development, prosperity, and disintegration. Another opinion was that the current historical community does not yet have a relatively unified opinion on the internal periodization of feudal society, and advocated that the syllabus should not be divided into periods for the time being, but only several dynasties with relatively similar social, economic, and political situations should be linked together and taught in five sections. A third opinion disagreed with the mid-Tang period as the boundary of the development stage of feudal society, and advocated that feudal society be divided into three stages: formation, development, and decline. Considering that the second opinion was consistent with the current spirit of middle school textbook writing, the majority ultimately adopted this opinion and included it in the teaching syllabus. Everyone believed that modern Chinese history could be divided into three periods: 1840 to 1864, 1864 to 1901, and 1901 to 1919.

    The discussion meeting put forward many opinions on the current teaching plan for the Ministry of Education to consider. Many people suggested concentrating the two education internships into one, while strengthening the usual observation and practice work. They reflected that the current students of literature and history departments do not have enough time to read and read too few books, and they should be given enough self-study time. Regarding the proportion of compulsory public courses and professional courses, they believed that professional courses should be appropriately increased, and the number and class hours of political courses should be appropriately reduced. Many people proposed abolishing school hygiene courses. Some people also proposed that the history of education could be postponed. Some people suggested that the school system of normal colleges could be considered to be extended to five years.

    高等师范学校文史教学大纲讨论会
    审订二十种文史教学大纲
    新华社20日讯　八月六日到十八日，育教部委托北京师范大学主持的高等师范学校文、史教学大纲讨论会，审订了文、史系科二十种科目的教学大纲。
    教师们在讨论中国文学教学大纲时，特别就高等师范学校的大纲应有的特点进行了讨论。教师们从培养的目标考虑，在大纲中特别加重了各个时代文学作品的介绍和分析。
    在讨论会上，中国古典文学和现代文学的历史分期引起了争辩。例如有人认为唐代文学应该以传统的初唐、盛唐、中唐、晚唐分期法断限，但多数人主张应以隋唐五代文学分为前后两期以便论述作家与作品。对中国现代文学有人主张分为三期，也有人主张分为五期。
    关于现代汉语中语法定义的讨论，绝大多数教授同意语法是词的变化规则和用词造句规则的综合。但是有的教授对这个定义表示怀疑，认为在汉语中不能用词形变化来代替词法，而词法可以包括词形变化。他认为语法是词法和用词造句的规则。这个论点没有被大部分代表接受。座谈会把他的意见列入大纲的附件。
    中国古代及中世史的教学大纲首先就分期问题进行了讨论。教师们对封建社会内部的分期问题有很多不同见解。一种主张把封建社会分为形成、发展、繁荣、解体四个阶段。另一种意见认为当前史学界对封建社会内部的分期还没有比较趋向一致的意见，主张在教学大纲内暂不分期，只就社会经济政治情况较为接近的几个王朝连系在一起，分作五个段落讲授。第三种意见不同意唐中期作为封建社会发展阶段的分界，而主张封建社会为形成、发展、没落三个阶段。多数人考虑到第二种意见和当前中学课本编写精神一致，最后采用这种意见列入教学大纲中。大家认为中国近代史可以分为三期：那就是从1840年到1864年，1864年到1901年，1901年到1919年。
    讨论会对现行教学计划提出不少意见供教育部参考。很多人建议把两次教育实习集中为一次，同时加强平时的见习实习工作。他们反映：现在文、史系学生读书的时间不够，读的书太少，应该给他们足够的自修时间。对公共必修课和专业课的比重，他们认为应适当加重专业课，适当减少政治课的门数和上课时数。很多人提出取消学校卫生课。也有人提出教育史可暂缓开设。对师范院校学制有人提出可以考虑延长为五年。
