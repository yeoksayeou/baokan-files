    Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, August 27th: Thirty-eight family members of convicted Japanese war criminals who recently came to China met their relatives in Fushun today, after arriving from Tianjin.

    Kimayoshi Hitoshi's mother, upon seeing her son, said: "Seeing how strong your body is, I am relieved."

    Kogai Tadashi and his wife and son met here today. Kogai Tadashi instructed his 24-year-old son to take a good look at the great changes China has undergone in recent years during his stay in China. His son, Kogai Kenichi, told reporters that his father not only has a correct understanding now, but his personality has also become gentler, and he feels closer to him.

    In another room, Kashiwaba Yuichi met with his wife and daughter. When his daughter learned that the letters and packages sent to her father had all been received, she was very happy. His wife said, "I am relieved to see that you are living so well here."

    Sako Ryuichi repeatedly encouraged his son and daughter to study hard. He said, "In the past, I participated in the war of aggression and became a criminal. You must work hard to study for peace in the future."

    Tonight, eleven family members were approved by the management office to stay in Fushun.
