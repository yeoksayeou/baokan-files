    Having a Sense of Propriety
    Ji Yong
    "Having a sense of propriety" is an old saying, but the more you think about it, the deeper its meaning. Take color, for example; the degree of color must be just right to be called a certain color. Red, to be called red, must be red in just the right way. A little lighter and it's called pink; a little darker and it's purple. And "red to the point of turning purple" when used to describe someone, is often a bit sarcastic.
    It's often the case that something that is originally a good thing becomes a bad thing if overdone. For example, encouragement can originally boost morale and allow people to unleash their potential, but if encouragement goes beyond the proper limit, it turns into "flattery" or "sycophancy," causing the unstable recipient to become intoxicated and forget themselves. Further, it may even cause the recipient to become arrogant and see no one else, only able to hear praise and flattery, unable to hear criticism. In this way, a good thing turns into a bad thing.

    有分寸

    “有分寸”这话是老话，但越想意味越深长。就颜色说，色泽程度必须恰好才能名之谓某色。红之称作红必须红得恰如其分。浅一点称之为粉色，深一点则又是紫了，而红得发紫用来形容某人物时，多半是有点讥刺意味的。
    也常常本来是好事，做过了头就成了坏事。例如鼓励原来可以振作人心，让人发挥潜在力量，但是鼓励过了分寸就会变作“捧”或“拍”，使沉不住气的受者醺醺然忘了自己，再进一步还可能促使受者妄自尊大、目中无人，只听得见表扬奉承，听不得批评。这样，好事办成了坏事。
