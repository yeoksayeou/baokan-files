Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th. The Lüda men's basketball team defeated the Shenyang men's basketball team with a score of 62 to 53 tonight, winning the championship of the 1956 National Basketball Championship men's division. The Shenyang team won the second place.

The women's division champion was won by the Beijing women's basketball team, which won all nine games in this championship. The runner-up was the Tianjin women's basketball team.

The 1956 National Basketball Championship has been underway since August 17th, and the competition has been very intense. In the eighty games before today, the scores of the winning and losing sides in twenty games differed by no more than ten points, and four of them differed by only one point. Because the levels of the teams are similar, some teams had exactly the same number of wins and losses in the previous few games, so the rankings after the champion and runner-up could not be determined until today.

    全国篮球锦标赛结束
    旅大男队北京女队得冠军
    新华社郑州28日电　旅大男子篮球队今天晚上以六十二比五十三战胜沈阳男子篮球队，获得了1956年全国篮球锦标赛男子组的冠军，沈阳队获得了亚军。
    女子组冠军由这次锦标赛中九战九胜的北京女子篮球队获得，亚军是天津女子篮球队。
    1956年全国篮球锦标赛从8月17日开始以来，比赛一直进行得很紧张。在今天以前的八十场比赛中，有二十场胜负两方的比分相差不超过十分，其中有四场只相差一分。由于各队的水平相差不多，有些队在以前几场比赛中胜负的场次都完全一样，所以冠军、亚军以后的名次今天还不能评出。
