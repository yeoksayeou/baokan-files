    Wandering Through the Book Forest
    Wang Mao Xiao: A History of Plum Blossoms

    Many ancient books have been lost. Fortunately, some are passed down as unique copies. When we happen to encounter one, shouldn't we cherish it as if it were our own eyes? In a bookstore in Hangzhou, I came across "A History of Plum Blossoms" and was surprised to find a book I had never seen before, so I eagerly bought it. I carried it in my luggage, never leaving its side, which shows how much I treasured it. The author, Wang Mao Xiao, whose courtesy name was Yuqing, was from Xiuning, and probably a painter. Wu Ziyu's preface says: "Wang Bozi Yuqing of my county is solely devoted to it, and is praised by the painters of the county at the time." The book was carved during the Wanli period (around 1600), very exquisitely, by the engraver Huang Shiqing, a skilled craftsman of the Huizhou school of printmaking. It begins with seven "Narratives on Painting Plum Blossoms": Origin, Naming, Models, Brushwork, Creation, Inheritance, and Emphasis. What follows are the "illustrations." They exhaust the beauty of plum blossoms in every state, fully expressing the clearness, strangeness, simplicity and rusticity of "plum blossoms." In the Song Dynasty, Song Boren carved "Plum Blossom Joyful Spirit Spectrum." During the Qianlong period, Shen reproduced it. Bao of Zhibuzu Studio also carved it, including it in the "Series" collection, volume twenty-six. There is a volume "Luofu Illusion" in "Yimen Guangdu." In the late Ming Dynasty, Huang engraved eight types of painting manuals, one of which was also a "Plum Blossom Manual." Books on painting plum blossoms are "not alone." Only this "History of Plum Blossoms" is the rarest. Today, when people reproduce ancient paintings, they can maintain the spirit of the original in exquisite ruled-line paintings, flowing sleeves, delicate bees and butterflies, and even antiques and figures, but when reproducing old trunks and tender branches, the brushwork is greatly weakened, merely resembling the form, lacking vitality, completely obliterating the elegance of "oblique shadows." Huang Shiqing's carving of "A History of Plum Blossoms" has extremely powerful knife work, and can also express the painter's original intention. There must be some reason for this, which should be studied in depth. (Attached picture)

    汪懋孝：梅史

    古书之失传者多矣。幸而孤本相传，偶一遇之，得不像爱护头眼似地爱护它么？我在杭州一书肆，获见“梅史”，即诧为未见书，亟购得之。携之行箧，不离左右，可谓珍惜之至。作者汪懋孝，字虞卿，休宁人，大概是一位画家。吴子玉的序道：“予邑汪伯子虞卿，乃独耽而专焉，为一时邑之画学所称。”书为万历间（约1600年）所刻，甚精，刻工为黄时卿，是一个徽派版画刻工的能手。首有“写梅叙论”七则：原起、名法、楷模、笔墨、造妙、师承及郑重。以下就是“插图”了。穷态极妍，尽“梅”的清奇与古拙之致。宋代有宋伯仁的，曾刻“梅花喜神谱”。乾隆间，沈氏曾翻刻之。知不足斋鲍氏也刻之，收入“丛书”第二十六集。“夷门广牍”里有“罗浮幻质”一卷。明末，黄氏刻画谱八种，其中也有一册“梅谱”。关于论画梅的书是“我道不孤”的。独此“梅史”为最罕见。今人翻刻古画，于精致的界画，飘拂的衣袂，纤丽的蜂蝶，乃至博古、人物，均能不失原作的精神，但于翻刻老干嫩枝时，则笔力大弱，仅具形似，少有生气，完全抹煞了“清影横斜”的风度。黄时卿刻“梅史”，则刀法极有力，也能表现出画家的本意来。这里面一定有些道理，应该加以深刻的研讨。（附图片）
