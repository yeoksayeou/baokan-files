    People say that Xiong Jinwu, the vice-chairman of the Jubao Agricultural Cooperative in Changde, is an extraordinary man. He hasn't had much schooling and still doesn't recognize many characters. However, he is very good at raising pigs and cattle. He can use charred powder made from Sichuan pepper, turtle shells, and dog bones, mixed into porridge, to prevent and control swine fever. When the primary cooperative was established, Xiong Jinwu took in eight cows and two bulls. That year, a major flood submerged the fields and houses in Jubao Township, and there was no place to keep the cattle, so Xiong Jinwu grazed them in the mountains. A year later, all eight cows had calves, and even a "Piaoshazi" cow that hadn't conceived in ten years became a mother. People were very curious and asked Xiong Jinwu. Xiong Jinwu said:
    "In April, May, and June, the grass in the mountains is tender and good, and the cattle all gained weight. The bulls and cows are together all day long, and even those who didn't graze before learned to graze."
    Xiong Jinwu is not only good at raising pigs, cattle, and sheep, but also at beekeeping. He has six years of beekeeping experience. Now, he and his beekeeping team raise twenty-three hives of bees.
    Once, a reporter found him and asked him to talk about bees. He smiled and said, "This is a whole book of knowledge, you can't finish talking about it in a day." But he still briefly talked about his observations of bee life, occasionally interjecting a few words about beekeeping experience.
    He said that bees are organized. The division of labor among the various bee species is also clear. The queen bee has a lifespan of three or four years. Her duty is to lead the bee colony and reproduce. The queen bee mates not in the hive. She flies into the sky, and the drones follow her. Soon, she will fall to the ground with a drone. If she falls into a pond or stream, she will drown. Because this misfortune is possible, out of ten queen bee matings, if you're lucky, only seven are successful; if you're unlucky, only half are successful. After mating, the queen bee can lay four thousand eggs in a day and night, which is roughly enough to make up for the daily loss of worker bees. About four thousand worker bees die in a hive every day.
    Queen bees are either born naturally or artificially created. Natural queens are very timid. Artificially created queens are a little bolder. Experienced beekeepers can cultivate strong queens. Strong queens produce more offspring, and their bee colonies can produce more honey.
    Both the queen bee and the worker bees carry weapons on their bodies, which is the sharp sword hidden behind their tails. If someone provokes them, they will impolitely start fighting, using their swords to fiercely stab people's hands or faces.
    Speaking of this, Xiong Jinwu stretched out his arm to show the places where he had been stung. He said that at first, a sting would make his hand swell up, but not anymore. After being stung many times, his body developed antitoxins, so it doesn't swell. Now, he can approach the bee hives without gloves or a face mask, which others absolutely need.
    Xiong Jinwu continued, saying that once a bee shoots out its sword, it dies. Worker bees have a bad temper and are easily angered, readily drawing their swords, so many of them die. The queen bee is more tolerant and doesn't get angry easily. She only uses her sword as a last resort.
    Worker bees are diligent laborers. They can live for four months in the winter when work is not busy. In the summer, especially during the blooming season of rapeseed flowers, grass seed flowers, and other flowers, their lifespan is only two months. Worker bees start working only four days after becoming adults from pupae. At this time, their wings are soft and they cannot fly, so they stay at home as nannies, feeding their younger siblings with honey and water. After being nannies for four days, they immediately participate in security, sanitation, and transportation work, which they do for a total of four days. They take their security work very seriously. The entrance to the bee hive is heavily guarded, and ants and other bees cannot possibly sneak in. The worker bees also regularly clean the hive of excrement, and they have to fly to the fields, ponds, or streams to bring water back home for drinking and honey-making.
    Drones are lazy. They don't collect flowers and they don't make honey. They don't have swords on their bodies, so they can't defend the hive or fight. They are even too lazy to clean their own housing, but they have big bellies and are the best at eating sugar. To reduce the useless consumption of honey, beekeepers often have to pinch off excess drones.
    Xiong Jinwu is as familiar with his bee colonies as he is with his pig and cattle herds. He said that beekeepers must be skilled and meticulous. Because bees are delicate insects, a little carelessness can cause problems. Recently, the Jubao Cooperative's bee colonies had an accident. The cooperative originally had twenty-six hives of bees, which were recently moved from Danzhou to Jubao. They put the bee hives on horse-drawn carts and small boats, and they were stuffy for half a day, resulting in the death of three hives of bees and three queens.
    Xiong Jinwu reviewed this accident and said:
    "This is because we didn't give the bees water during the move, and the bee hives were too hot and too crowded."
    Despite this unexpected setback, Xiong Jinwu confidently stated that they would develop the twenty-three hives of bees into fifty hives within a year.

### 熊进五和他的蜜蜂

    熊进五和他的蜜蜂
    周立波
    人们说，常德聚宝农业社的副社长熊进五是一个奇人。他没有读过书，至今识字还不多。但是，他很会喂猪，又会喂牛。他能用花椒、乌龟板和狗骨头烤成的焦末，拌在稀饭里，去防治猪瘟。办初级社时，熊进五收了八条母牛，两只骚牯。那年涨大水，聚宝乡的田土和房屋都给淹没了，牛没有地方关，熊进五把它们都放牧在山里。一年以后，八条母牛都下了崽子，连一只十年没有走草的“飘沙子”也做了母亲。人们很奇怪，去问熊进五。熊进五说：
    “四五六月，山上的草又嫩又好，牛都上了膘。公牛和母牛一天到晚在一块，不走草的，也跟走草的学了。”
    熊进五不但会喂猪牛羊，也会养蜂。他有了六年养蜂的经验。现在，他和他的养蜂小组养了二十三箱蜂。
    有一回，一位记者找着他，要他谈蜜蜂。他笑一笑说：“这是一本经，一天都谈不完的。”但他还是简略地谈了他对蜜蜂生活的观察，间或，插一两句养蜂的经验。
    他说，蜜蜂是有组织性的。各个蜂种分工也明确。蜂王有三年或四年的寿命。她的职责是带领蜂群，传宗接代。蜂王交配，不在箱里。她飞上天空，雄蜂跟着她。不久，她会跟一个雄蜂一起掉下地来，要是落到水塘里或是溪流里，就会淹死。由于可能有这种不幸，十个王交配，碰得好，也只有七个成功，碰得不好，成功的只有一半。蜂王交配以后，一天一夜，能产四千子，大致可以补足每天死去的工蜂的遗缺，一箱蜂里，每天约莫要死去四千只工蜂。
    蜂王有天生的，也有人造的。天然王胆子很小。人造王胆子大一些。有经验的养蜂人能培养强王。强王产子多，她的蜂群能多酿蜜糖。
    蜂王和工蜂，身上都带了武器，就是藏在尾巴后边的快剑。要是有人惹发了她们，她们会不客气地动起武来，用她们的剑，猛烈地刺着人的手或脸。
    说到这里，熊进五把他的手膀子伸出来看，指出他的被刺的地方。他说，起先刺一下，手会肿起来，现在不了，刺的回数多，身子里有了抗毒素，就不肿了。现在他接近蜂箱，不用手套和面罩，别的人是非要不行的。
    熊进五接着又说，蜜蜂把剑一射出，自己就死了。工蜂脾气大，爱发怒，动不动就亮出剑来，死的很多。蜂王度量大一些，不大发脾气，她的宝剑，非到万不得已时，是不肯用的。
    工蜂们都是辛勤的劳动者。她们在工作不忙的冬天，能活四个月。在夏天，尤其是在油菜花、草子花和别的花朵盛开的时节，她们的寿命只有两个月。工蜂由蛹变为成虫才四天，就开始劳动。这时候，她们的翅膀软，不能起飞，都在家里当保姆，用蜜和水去喂养弟妹。当了四天保姆以后，她们随即参加治安、卫生和运输等工作，这些差使，一共做四天。她们的治安工作做得很认真。蜂箱门口，警卫森严，蚂蚁和别的蜂子要想混进门去，是万万不能的。工蜂们还经常地打扫箱里的粪便，又要飞到田里、塘里或溪里，把水含回家，作为饮用和酿蜜之用。
    雄蜂们都是懒汉。他们不去采花，也不会酿蜜。他们身上没有剑，不能够保卫蜂箱，也不会作战。他们连自己的住房也懒得打扫，肚子却很大，最会吃糖。为了减少蜜糖的无益的消耗，养蜂人常常要去捏死多余的雄蜂。
    熊进五熟悉他的蜂群，正和他熟悉猪群和牛群一样。他说，养蜂人要讲求技术，要细心。因为蜜蜂是娇贵的昆虫，稍许有一点粗心，就会出问题。最近，聚宝社的蜂群还出了事故。社里原有二十六箱蜂，最近从单洲搬到聚宝来，他们把蜂箱放在马车上和小船上，闷了半天，死了三箱蜂和三个王。
    熊进五检讨这次事故时说道：
    “这是因为搬动时没有给蜜蜂放水，蜂箱里太热，也太挤了。”
    尽管遭受了这次意外，熊进五还是满怀信心地表示：他们在一年以内就要把二十三箱蜜蜂发展成为五十箱。
