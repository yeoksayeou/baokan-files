　　My younger sister just finished her college entrance exam and breathed a sigh of relief. She wanted to borrow some books from the library of her former middle school, but the library refused, reasoning: if you borrow them and don't return them, where would we find you!

　　I remember before liberation, many people's walls were topped with broken glass and the like, essentially treating every passerby as a thief to be guarded against. But what day is this now? The school is actually so distrustful of its students?

　　However, if the school's concerns are indeed based on solid grounds, then it truly makes one uneasy about the educational work of this school!

　　This happened at Beijing No. 13 Girls' Middle School.

    不放心
    彦祥
    妹妹刚考完大学，松了口气，想找原在的中学的图书馆借些书看；但是，图书馆不借，理由是：如果借了不还，到哪儿找你去！
    记得解放前许多人家的墙头，都插着玻璃渣子之类，等于把过路人一律当贼来提防。然而今日何日？学校对学生竟这样放心不下？
    但是，假如学校方面的担心确有充足的根据，那倒真教人对这个学校的教育工作不放心了！
    这事情发生在北京第十三女子中学。
