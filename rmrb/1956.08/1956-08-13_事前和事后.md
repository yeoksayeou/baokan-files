    Before and After
    Shi Liuming

    "Minor injury, the district chief doesn't know; serious injury, the mine manager is scared; death, the manager comes to mourn." This is a coal miner's "grumble" in the face of neglected safety.

    These few sentences have deep meaning and are quite thought-provoking. Think about it, isn't it piercing the shortcomings in the work style of some enterprise leaders?

    In our enterprises, there are many such things: only thinking of handling the aftermath of accidents that have already occurred when inspecting safety work; immediately organizing shock work when understanding the progress of plan implementation; discussing how to rework products only when studying product quality; looking for the reasons for overspending while calculating costs; and having to review bureaucracy when investigating the living welfare of employees.

    To do enterprise leadership work, it is necessary to frequently go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and take measures with foresight to prevent possible problems. If not, the doggerel written by that coal miner will definitely increase, and the harm to our cause will become greater and greater.

    事前和事后
    石六鸣
    “轻伤，区长不知道；重伤，矿长吓一跳；死亡，经理来吊孝。”这是一个煤矿工人面对忽视安全的情况所发的“牢骚”。
    这几句话含义很深，颇耐寻味。想想看，它是不是正刺着某些企业领导作风上的缺点呢？
    在我们的企业中，有不少这样的事：检查安全工作的时候才想起对已经发生的事故作善后处理；了解计划执行情况的时候，马上组织突击；研究产品质量的时候才讨论如何返工；计算成本的同时寻找超支的原因；调查职工生活福利情况的时候不得不检讨官僚主义。
    做企业的领导工作，要经常深入下层了解情况，有预见地采取办法防止可能发生的问题。如果不是这样，像那位煤矿工人写的打油诗一定会多起来，对我们的事业的危害也将越来越大。
