How to Calculate Agricultural Cooperative Cadre Subsidies Reasonably

Jin Mingqiao

The general principle for handling the subsidy remuneration of agricultural production cooperative staff in various places is: the number of labor days made by the agricultural cooperative staff themselves, plus the subsidized labor days, should be equivalent to the number of labor days made by a medium-level laborer throughout the year. (The total remuneration received by the cooperative director should be slightly higher than this standard). However, what method to use for calculation in order to be reasonable is still a question worth studying. At present, many agricultural cooperatives have shortcomings in their calculations, so the subsidized labor remuneration is not reasonable, even very unreasonable. Here, we can cite the method of the Deli Temple Collective Farm in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, as an example (see "China Agricultural News" No. 11, 1956, article "Methods for Subsidizing Remuneration of Production Team Leaders").

This collective farm is mainly engaged in fruit tree production. The fruit tree production team leader is expected to spend half of his time on technical guidance work throughout the year and can only directly participate in production for one hundred and eighty days. The cooperative's subsidy to the production team leader is based on the number of days the team leader actually participated in production throughout the year (which can be converted into labor days first), and then calculates the subsidized labor days according to the percentage prescribed by the team based on the amount of land, fruit trees, and labor. This method of calculating subsidy remuneration is very unscientific and cannot achieve fairness and reasonableness. Because the subsidized labor days obtained by this team leader vary with the number of labor days he himself makes: the more labor days he makes, the more subsidies he gets, and vice versa. In doing so, he is actually rewarding team leaders who do less work and only focus on participating in more production, while team leaders who do good work and have more missed work are not given appropriate subsidies. The inevitable drawback it produces is: prompting the team leader to do less leadership work and only focus on making more labor days for himself; because the more he does this, the greater the remuneration he gets.

Therefore, the subsidy remuneration for agricultural cooperative staff must not increase or decrease with the increase or decrease of their own labor days. When calculating, it should not be based on the amount of land, fruit trees, labor, etc., but should be based on the amount of necessary missed work for leadership work and the quality of leadership work. The more necessary missed work due to leading production or handling cooperative affairs, the more the subsidy amount should be, and the less necessary missed work, the less the subsidy amount should be. If a certain staff member does not work diligently and deliberately wastes time, resulting in his missed work exceeding the necessary number (reasonable number), then the excess portion should not be subsidized to him; if a certain staff member works diligently and can spare more time to participate in production, resulting in his missed work being lower than the necessary number, then the saved portion should also be subsidized to him, that is, the subsidy should still be given according to the necessary missed work number. At the same time, the subsidy to staff members should not only be based on the necessary missed work time, but also on the quality of his work. Only in this way can we truly promote agricultural cooperative staff to actively participate in production labor on the premise of doing a good job.

Next, we want to study the "fixed quota subsidy, fixed work production, and year-end reward combination" method widely promoted in Hebei Province. This method fixes the remuneration that each person should be subsidized annually and the number of labor days they should make themselves according to the amount, importance, complexity, and simplicity of the work undertaken by the staff, as well as the amount of time they can participate in production themselves. If they make more labor days themselves, the excess is entirely their own; if the management work is done well, they can get a year-end reward. Some cooperatives also stipulate that if a staff member is passive and irresponsible in his work and causes losses, some work points should be appropriately deducted. This calculation method is very simple, but it also has unreasonable aspects.

Now, let's take the Xijing'an Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County as an example (see the People's Daily article "Reasonably Stipulating the Remuneration of Agricultural Production Cooperative Staff" on May 26th). This cooperative estimates that each superior laborer can make 250 labor days throughout the year. The cooperative director is a superior laborer. In addition to doing a good job of leadership, he is expected to be able to make 100 labor days throughout the year. Therefore, he is subsidized 150 labor days so that his remuneration is equal to that of a superior laborer. Since the subsidized labor days are fixed and the actual labor days made are variable, only when the actual labor days made throughout the year are exactly equal to the originally estimated number can the labor days obtained by the superior laborer be equal to the labor days obtained by the cooperative director. If the actual labor days made by the superior laborer are less than the estimated number, although the labor days made by the cooperative director himself are reduced in the same proportion (which is reasonable), the total number of labor days he obtains relatively increases because the subsidy portion is fixed. The fewer labor days the superior laborer makes, the more labor days the cooperative director gets relatively. If the actual labor days made by the superior laborer are more than the estimated number, although the labor days made by the cooperative director himself are increased in the same proportion, the total number of labor days he obtains relatively decreases. The labor remuneration of the superior laborer and the cooperative director is always inversely proportional: the cooperative director suffers when more labor days are actually made; the superior laborer suffers when fewer labor days are actually made.

According to the same principle, under the condition that the subsidized labor days are fixed, the more the total number of labor days actually made by the entire cooperative throughout the year exceeds the estimated labor days, the more the remuneration of the cooperative's management personnel relatively decreases; conversely, the fewer the total number of labor days made by the entire cooperative throughout the year falls short of the estimated labor days, the more the remuneration of the management personnel relatively increases.

It is very obvious that if the above calculation method is adopted and the subsidized labor days of the management personnel are fixed, it may cause the following deviations: the management personnel of the agricultural cooperative try their best to lower the labor days that should be earned for completing each work quota, so that everyone makes fewer labor days, thereby increasing the remuneration of the management personnel. Obviously, fixing the subsidized labor days is not in line with the principle of distribution according to work.

If the subsidized labor days are not fixed, what should be done? Still taking the Xijing'an cooperative mentioned above as an example. Since the cooperative estimates that each superior laborer can make an average of 250 labor days throughout the year, and the cooperative director is equivalent to a superior laborer and can only make 100 labor days himself, that is to say, he spends 40% of his time participating in production. In this way, he can be subsidized 60% of the labor days actually made by each superior laborer throughout the year, instead of fixing the subsidized labor days. In this way, the labor days made by the cooperative director himself and the subsidized labor days both increase or decrease in the same proportion with the increase or decrease of the labor days made by the superior laborer. Regardless of whether the actual labor days made are more or less, the labor days obtained by the superior laborer and the cooperative director are always equal. When the income of the cooperative members is low, the remuneration of the staff is also low, and the more the income of the cooperative members, the more the remuneration of the staff, the water rises and the boat rises, and the two are always directly proportional.

That is to say, the subsidized labor days of a certain staff member are equal to the number of labor days made by each laborer of that grade on average throughout the year, multiplied by the percentage of necessary missed work of the person. As long as the percentage of necessary missed work is determined reasonably, the result it seeks will inevitably be reasonable; but if this percentage is too low or too high, it will also cause unreasonable phenomena.

Here, let's explain again what the percentage of necessary missed work is. For example, according to the work within the cooperative undertaken by a certain staff member, it is enough to occupy 40% of the total work and production time. However, because he is lazy and does not actively participate in production (not that he does not have time to participate in production), as a result, he occupies 50% of the time in the work within the cooperative; or because he works diligently and is particularly active in production, as a result, he only occupies 30% of the time in the work within the cooperative. In this way, his necessary missed work number is 40% instead of 50% or 30%; the labor days subsidized to him should be calculated according to 40%, and should not be calculated according to 50%.

Then, how can this percentage be determined reasonably? At the beginning of the year, the agricultural cooperative can certainly calculate the estimated missed work percentage of each subsidized staff member separately according to the estimated labor days, and this percentage can be used for trial calculation. However, this percentage, like the subsidized labor days, cannot be fixed and unchanged according to the estimated number. Because it is difficult to accurately calculate the necessary missed work number in advance, some unforeseen missed work is unavoidable (such as meetings), or unforeseen labor savings (such as less work within the cooperative than expected). Therefore, when determining the percentage, the estimated number should be used as the basis, and then adjusted with reference to the actual situation, appropriately increasing or decreasing this percentage; and when the estimated number is roughly consistent with the actual situation, this percentage may not need to be changed.

    农业社干部的补贴怎样计算才合理
    金明桥
    各地处理农业生产合作社工作人员补贴报酬的一般原则是：农业社工作人员自己所作的劳动日数，加上补贴的劳动日数，应相当于一个中等劳力全年所作的劳动日数。
  （社主任得到的报酬总数应稍高于这个标准）。但是采用什么办法计算才能合理，还是一个值得研究的问题。目前，许多农业社在计算上有缺点，因此所补贴的劳动报酬并不合理，甚至很不合理。这里可以举出辽宁省复县得利寺集体农庄的办法作为例子（见“中国农报”1956年第11期“生产队长补助报酬的办法”一文）。
    这个集体农庄是以果树生产为主，果树生产队队长预计全年要用一半的时间去作技术指导工作，只能有一百八十天直接参加生产。社里对生产队长的补贴，是以这个队长自己全年实际参加生产的天数为基础（可以先折成劳动日数），再按队里根据土地、果树、劳力的多少所规定出的百分数来计算补贴劳动日。这种补贴报酬的计算办法很不科学，不能作到公平合理。因为这个队长所得的补贴劳动日数，是随着他自己所作劳动日的多少而变的：他自己所作劳动日越多，给他的补贴就越多，反之就越少。这样作，实际上是奖励了少作工作、只顾自己多参加生产的队长，而对于因为作好工作、误工多的队长，并没有适当给以补助。它所产生的弊病必然是：促使队长少作领导工作，只顾自己多作劳动日；因为越是这样，他得的报酬就越大。
    因此，给农业社工作人员的补贴报酬，决不能随着他自己所作劳动日数的增减而增减，在计算时，也不要以土地、果树、劳力的多少等等为标准，而应以为了做领导工作必要的误工多少和领导工作做得好坏为标准。由于领导生产或处理社务必要的误工越多，补贴数额应越多，必要的误工越少，补贴数额也应越少。如果某一工作人员在工作上不抓紧，故意消耗时间，结果他的误工数超过了必要数（合理数），那末对他的超过部分不应补贴；如果某一工作人员在工作上抓的紧，能够多抽出时间参加生产，结果他的误工数低于必要数，那末对他的节约部分也应给以补贴，即仍按必要的误工数给以补贴。同时，对工作人员的补贴，不但要根据必要的误工时间，而且要考虑到他的工作好坏。只有这样，才能真正促使农业社的工作人员在作好工作的前提下，积极地参加生产劳动。
    往下，我们要研究一下河北省普遍推广的“定额补贴、定工生产和年终奖励相结合”的办法。这个办法是按照工作人员所担负的工作多少、轻重、繁简程度，以及他们自己可能参加生产的时间多少，把每人每年应补贴的报酬和自己应作的劳动日数都固定下来。自己多作了劳动日，多的部分全归自己；管理工作搞得好，年终可以得到奖励。有的社还规定，如果某一工作人员工作消极不负责任，造成了损失，要适当扣除一些工分。这种办法计算很简便，但也有不合理的地方。
    现在，我们以邢台县西静庵农业社为例（见五月二十六日人民日报“合理规定农业生产合作社工作人员的报酬”一文）。这个社预计每个上等劳力全年可作二百五十个劳动日。社主任是个上等劳力，他除了作好领导工作以外，预计全年还能作一百个劳动日。因此给他补贴的劳动日是一百五十个，使他与一个上等劳力的报酬相等。由于补贴劳动日数是固定不变的，而实际所作劳动日数是可多可少的，只有当全年实际所作的劳动日数，和原来预计数完全相等时，上等劳力所得的劳动日数才能与社主任所得的劳动日数相等。如果上等劳力实际所作的劳动日数，比预计数少了，虽然社主任自己所作的劳动日数也按同一比例减少（这是合理的），但由于补贴部分是固定不变的，结果他所得的劳动日总数却相对地增加了。上等劳力的劳动日数越少，社主任的劳动日数就相对地越多。如果上等劳力实际所作的劳动日数，比预计数多了，虽然社主任自己所作的劳动日数也按同一比例增加，但他所得的劳动日总数却相对地减少了。上等劳力与社主任的劳动报酬，总是成反比：实际多作劳动日的时候，社主任吃亏；实际少作劳动日的时候，上等劳力吃亏。
    按照同样的道理，在补贴劳动日数固定不变的情况下，全社全年总共实际所作的劳动日数，越是多于预计的劳动日数，那末全社管理人员的报酬就越是相对地减少；反之，全社全年总共所作的劳动日数，越是少于预计的劳动日数，管理人员的报酬也就越是相对地增加。
    十分明显，如果采用上述计算办法，把管理人员的补贴劳动日数固定下来，就可能引起如下偏向：农业社的管理人员尽量压低完成每个工作定额应得的劳动日数，使大家所作的劳动日数都减少，从而提高管理人员的报酬。显然，把补贴劳动日数固定下来，是不符合按劳取酬的原则的。
    如果不固定补贴的劳动日数，该怎么办呢？还以上面所举西静庵社为例。既然该社每个上等劳力平均全年可作二百五十个劳动日，而社主任相当于上等劳力，自己只能作一百个劳动日，那就是说他有40％的时间参加生产。这样，就可以补贴给他每个上等劳力平均全年实际所作劳动日60％，而不固定补贴的劳动日数。这样社主任自作的劳动日与补贴的劳动日，都是按同一比例随着上等劳力所作劳动日的增减而增减。不管实际所作劳动日数是多是少，上等劳力与社主任所得的劳动日数总是相等的。社员收入少的时候，工作人员的报酬也少，社员收入越多，工作人员的报酬也越多，水涨船高，二者之间总是成正比。
    这就是说，某一工作人员的补贴劳动日数，等于该等劳力每人平均全年所作的劳动日数，乘本人必要的误工百分数。只要把必要的误工百分数确定得合理，它所求出的结果就必然是合理的；但如果这个百分数偏低或者偏高，也会造成不合理的现象。
    这里再解释一下什么是必要的误工百分数。比方说，某一工作人员按他所担负的社内工作，占用全部工作和生产时间的40％就够了。但是由于他偷懒，没有积极参加生产（不是没有时间参加生产），结果，他在社内工作方面占用了50％的时间；或者由于他工作抓的紧，生产又特别积极，结果在社内工作方面只占用了30％的时间。这样，他的必要误工数就是40％而不是50％或30％；给他补贴的劳动日数，应该按40％计算，而不应该按50％计算。
    那末，怎样才能把这个百分数确定得合理呢？农业社在一年之初，当然可以按照预计的劳动日数，分别求出受补贴的每一工作人员预计误工的百分数，并且可以用这个百分数进行试算。但是，这个百分数也和补贴劳动日数一样，是不可以按照预计数固定不变的。因为，事先很难把必要的误工数算得准确，难免有一些预料不到的误工（例如开会），或者预料不到的省工（例如社内工作比预计的少了）。所以，在确定百分数的时候，要以预计数为基础，然后参照实际情况加以调整，适当提高或者降低这个百分数；而当预计数与实际情况大体相一致时，这个百分数也可不必变动。
