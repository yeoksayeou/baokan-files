    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th August: The "Deccan Herald" published an editorial on August 15th criticizing the U.S. State Department's ban on American journalists visiting China. It said that this ridiculously proves "how the defenders of democracy and the maintainers of the 'free world' will find themselves in the awkward position of having to take autocratic measures in their anti-communist crusade."

    The newspaper, in reference to the nationwide protest in the United States against this ban, said that the State Department's stubborn insistence on maintaining its decision in the face of the "obvious signs of rapidly growing public interest" due to China's invitation only confirms "the worldwide impression that the U.S. government does not respect public opinion."

    The editorial said: "American journalists can serve as faithful eyes and ears of the keen American public, enabling them to understand the reality of mainland China; but this is precisely what Dulles seems always eager to avoid."

    The editorial added: "The free exchange of news and opinions between countries and peoples will promote the cause of world peace; it can also restrain those in power who enjoy dancing on the 'edge of war'."

    Xinhua News Agency, 17th August: Bangkok News: "Universal Daily News" published another editorial on August 11th saying that just when China has opened its doors and expressed a very warm welcome, the U.S. government has banned American journalists from visiting China, which has definitely caused the United States to suffer a loss in the eyes of the world.

    This editorial, entitled "Facing the Facts," refuted Dulles's claim that the safety of American journalists could not be guaranteed, saying that the Americans detained by China were detained because they violated laws related to China's security. However, these American journalists who have been approved to enter China are different from those people, and they do not necessarily have anything to fear when they go to China.

    The editorial believes that allowing American journalists to visit China and fully and freely criticize or praise China according to their own opinions will benefit both China and the United States, enable the two countries to develop a good understanding of each other, and thus be able to coexist peacefully.

    印、泰报纸斥美国务院禁止记者访华
    美国政府害怕面对现实
    新华社新德里17日电　“德干先驱报”八月十五日发表社论斥责美国国务院不准美国记者访问中国的禁令。它说，这令人可笑地证明了“民主的保卫者和‘自由世界’的维护者在他们反共十字军中，将怎样地发现他们自己是处在必须采取专制措施的窘境中”。
    这家报纸谈到在美国反对这项禁令的全国性抗议说，在由于中国的邀请而在“公众中迅速引起巨大兴趣这一明显迹象”的面前，国务院固执地保持它的决定不变的作法只是证实了“全世界的这样一种印象：美国政府不尊重舆论”。
    社论说：“美国的记者可以作为美国热心公众的忠实的耳目，使他们了解大陆中国的实际；但是，这正是杜勒斯似乎一直急于要避免的。”
    社论又说：“国家间和人民间的自由交换新闻和意见，将促进世界和平事业；这还可以制止那些欢喜在‘战争边缘’上跳舞的执政的人。”
    新华社17日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”八月十一日再次发表社论说，正当中国打开大门表示非常欢迎时，美国政府却禁止美国记者访问中国，这已使得美国在世界面前遭受了肯定的损失。
    这篇以“面对事实”为题的社论反驳了杜勒斯的所谓不能保证美国记者的安全的说法说，那些被中国拘留的美国人，是因为他们触犯了有关中国安全的法律。但是这些被中国批准入境的美国记者和那些人不同，他们到中国去并不见得有什么可惧怕的。
    社论认为，让美国记者访问中国，并且按照自己意见充分自由地批评或赞扬中国，这将有利于中美两国，使两国互相间产生良好的了解，从而能够和平共处。
