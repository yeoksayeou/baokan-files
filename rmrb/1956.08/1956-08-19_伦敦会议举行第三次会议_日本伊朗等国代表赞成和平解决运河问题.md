Xinhua News Agency, London, August 18th - The London Conference discussing the Suez Canal issue held its third meeting on the afternoon of August 17th.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau spoke first. He further elaborated on Dulles' proposal. He said that France's proposal on the Suez Canal issue was put forward in the same spirit as the proposal put forward by Dulles. He said that the property and facilities of the canal must belong to Egypt, but the Suez Canal Company must be compensated. At the same time, the canal should be managed by an international body composed of representatives from countries mainly related to the use of the canal, including Egypt. According to the French government, this international body should not only be an organization that supervises the work of the canal, but also an organization that manages the canal. Its powers include determining toll rates, investment amounts, compensation amounts, and payments to Egypt. Pineau said that France would agree to establish a link between this international body and the United Nations.
    In his speech, Pineau attempted to prove that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was inconsistent with international law. He also said that the Egyptian government's actions were full of threats to the freedom of navigation on the canal. Pineau argued that the Egyptian government's statement on guaranteeing the freedom of navigation on the canal could not effectively guarantee the free passage of ships of countries using the canal, therefore, an international body must be established to manage the canal.
    Pineau also said that the task of the conference was only to make a decision on the issues discussed at the conference, not to seek ways to implement this decision.
    Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange also denied the legality of the nationalization of the Suez Canal in his speech, and agreed with the principles formulated by the three Western powers. But at the same time, he believed that flexibility was very important when considering different proposals, and a peaceful solution to the issue under discussion must be found.
    Next to speak was Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov. (Speech content to be issued separately)
    Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in his speech, advocated carefully considering all proposals in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. He said, "The Japanese government can understand the position of Britain and France, but Japan sympathizes with the legitimate demands of the people of Asian and African countries and supports the resolutions made at the Bandung Conference last April. We believe that to realize the wishes of any country, taking steady measures will be more effective. The Japanese government hopes that this conference can find a solution that can be adopted by all concerned countries. We believe that the plans put forward by various countries should be studied in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and strive for a peaceful solution."
    Danish Foreign Minister Hansen supported the proposals of the three Western powers, but he emphasized that Egypt's legitimate interests and sovereignty over the canal must be reasonably taken into account. He suggested that the specific research on the implementation of "international management arrangements" be presided over by the United Nations and carried out with the participation of Egypt.
    Spanish Foreign Minister Atajo, in his speech, advocated revising the 1888 Convention, and suggested that the Suez Canal should not be placed under international management, but that countries using the canal should send representatives to participate in the board of directors of the Egyptian agency that has taken over the Suez Canal Company.
    Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan emphasized the importance of the canal to his country. He said that Iran would support any international system that did not conflict with Egyptian sovereignty and guaranteed the freedom of navigation on the canal. He said the Western plan was "useful and constructive," but he opposed British and French military preparations.
    Representatives from West Germany, New Zealand, and Turkey also spoke at the meeting. These representatives all supported the plans of the three Western powers.
    The next meeting will be held on August 18.

    伦敦会议举行第三次会议
    日本伊朗等国代表赞成和平解决运河问题
    新华社伦敦18日电　讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议在八月十七日下午举行了第三次会议。
    法国外交部长比诺首先发言。他进一步发挥了杜勒斯的主张。他说，法国在苏彝士运河问题上的建议是本着同杜勒斯提出的建议相同的精神提出来的。他说，运河的财产和它的设施必须属于埃及，但是苏彝士运河公司必须得到赔偿。同时，这条运河应该由同使用这条运河主要有关的国家——包括埃及在内——的代表组成的一个国际机构来管理。按照法国政府的意见，这个国际机构应当不只是监督运河的工作的组织，而且应当是一个管理运河的组织。它的权力包括确定通行税率、投资数目、赔偿数目和交给埃及的款项。比诺说，法国将同意在这个国际机构和联合国之间建立联系。
    比诺在发言中企图证明埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是不符合国际法的。他并且说，埃及政府的行动充满了对这条运河的航行自由的威胁。比诺争辩说，埃及政府关于保证运河通航自由的声明不能够在实际上保证使用这条运河的国家的船只自由通过运河，因此，必须建立一个管理运河的国际机构。
    比诺还说，会议的任务只是就会议讨论的问题作出决定，而不是寻求执行这个决定的方法。
    挪威外交大臣兰格在发言中也否认把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动的合法性，并且赞成西方三国拟定的原则。但是他同时认为，在考虑不同的建议的时候，灵活性是十分重要的，必须为正在讨论的问题找到和平的解决方法。
    接着发言的是苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫。（发言内容另发）
    日本外务相重光在发言中主张根据联合国宪章的精神仔细考虑所有的建议。他说，“日本政府是能够理解英法两国的立场的，但是，日本对亚非国家人民的合法要求抱有同情，支持去年四月万隆会议作出的决议。我们相信，要实现任何一个国家的愿望。采取稳当的措施是会更有效果的。日本政府希望这个会议能够找出为所有有关国家可以采纳的解决办法。我们认为，各国提出的方案，应该根据联合国宪章的精神，进行研究，为求得和平解决而努力。”
    丹麦外交大臣汉森支持西方三国的主张，但是他强调必须合理地考虑到埃及对运河的合法利益和主权。他建议关于实行“国际管理安排”的具体研究由联合国来主持，并且在埃及参加的情况下进行。
    西班牙外交部长阿塔霍在发言中主张修改1888年公约，并且建议不必把苏彝士运河置于国际管理之下，而让使用这条运河的国家派代表参加已经接替苏彝士运河公司的埃及机构的董事会。
    伊朗外交大臣阿达兰强调运河对他的国家的重要性。他说，伊朗将支持同埃及主权没有抵触、并且保证运河通行自由的任何国际制度。他说西方的方案是“有用的并且是建设性的”，但是他反对英国和法国的军事准备。
    在会上发言的还有西德、新西兰和土耳其的代表。这些代表都支持西方三国的方案。
    下次会议将在八月十八日举行。
