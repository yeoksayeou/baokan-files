　　41 The next day, Li Baichuan finished his meal early and rushed to find Deputy Secretary Ma. Deputy Secretary Ma had just washed his face and asked him to sit on the edge of the kang, first asking, "Has the fire been investigated?"

　　42 Li Baichuan recounted the appearance of the arsonist as seen by Qiao Tianrui. Deputy Secretary Ma said, "Are you saying it was Shuming?" Li Baichuan said, "You can know a person's face but not their heart, his family already has prejudices against us!" Then he went on to talk about how Shuming and his father were.

　　43 Deputy Secretary Ma disagreed: "Shuming talked to me last night, all the way until your fire started!" Li Baichuan was stunned. Deputy Secretary Ma asked about the matter of upgrading to an advanced cooperative, Li Baichuan said: "The masses are not satisfied with Shuming, according to everyone's opinion, it's better to run the advanced cooperative separately in the west…

　　44 Before Li Baichuan could finish speaking, Shuming lifted the curtain and came in, startling Li Baichuan so much that he almost jumped up. Shuming smiled and sat down next to Li Baichuan on the edge of the kang, then asked with concern about how much grass had been burned in the fire last night.

    41　第二天，李百川早早吃完饭，便抢先找马副书记。马副书记刚洗完脸，把他让在炕沿上坐了，倒先问道：“着火的事，调查了没有？”
    42　李百川把乔天瑞所见的放火人的样子转述了一遍。马副书记说：“你说是树明？”李百川说：“知人知面不知心呐，他家对我们本来有成见！”接着还说树明和他爹如何如何。
    43　马副书记不同意：“昨晚树明跟我谈话，一直谈到你们起火！”李百川楞了。马副书记问起转高级社的事，李百川说：“群众对树明不满意，大伙的意见，高级社还是西头单独办好。……
    44　李百川话没说完，树明一挑帘子进来了，惊得李百川几乎蹦了起来。树明笑着挨李百川坐上炕沿，就关心地问起昨夜起火烧了多少草。
