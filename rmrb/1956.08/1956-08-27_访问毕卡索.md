    Visiting Picasso
    Yao Yun
    In the artistic life of France, one can feel the presence and influence of Picasso everywhere. Almost every art gallery inevitably displays his works, bookstores have all kinds of Picasso painting albums; imitating Picasso has become a trend in the pottery industry; and at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, a film about Picasso won an award. Pablo Picasso, this outstanding painter, the author of the "peace dove" spread all over the world, is originally from Spain and now resides in France. He has been a member of the French Communist Party since 1944.
    In mid-July, after visiting the big cities of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, the Chinese cultural delegation arrived in Cannes on the Mediterranean coast. Here, the blue bay is like a sparkling gem embedded between the golden beaches and green palm trees. The sun casts a bright glow on the blooming flowers and fruits. Picasso, who chose to work and live in this place, has always been troubled by frequent visitors, but he was very happy to receive friends from China.
    Picasso's residence is on a small hilltop called California in Cannes, only a few minutes' drive from the seaside. Entering his courtyard, you can see many of his sculptures and packaged artworks ready for shipment placed inside and outside the door of the building. A short old man wearing a blue short-sleeved open-necked shirt and coarse cloth pants came down from upstairs and extended his hand to the members of the Chinese cultural delegation. This is Picasso. He was born in 1881 and is already seventy-five years old this year, but his eyes are still deep and sharp, and his steps are light and steady. His palm is the palm of a worker and an artist. Decades of painting and sculpture have made his skin so tough.
    The painter immediately led us into his studio and let us freely admire his works. This room was originally the living room of the residence, but now it is full of things. Several easels are standing there, with portraits and compositions he painted on them. On the tables, in the corners of the walls, and on the floor, piles and piles of pottery bottles, pottery basins, and sculptures he designed and painted are placed, all showing the painter's amazing creativity and his efforts in artistic practice.
    In the center of the room on the floor is a birdcage, and two pure white young doves are jumping inside. Picasso picked up the cage and told us that it was a gift from a friend. Everyone naturally thought of the flying "peace dove" painted by Picasso, which has become a symbol of the determination and will of people of all countries to defend peace. We told him that the peace dove is also flying all over China. Picasso smiled, his eyes shining with a soft light, watching the two doves jumping happily with deep meaning.
    Taking advantage of this meeting, the head of the Chinese cultural delegation, Hou Debang, presented Picasso with a gift brought from China to express our respect. Picasso opened the paper package, which contained a vermilion Fujian lacquer small vase. He picked it up and said very keenly: "The color of this vase is very good." Then, he quickly took a few steps forward and placed this vase side by side with a blue pottery vase he painted himself. The colors of the two vases form a strong contrast, each with its own characteristics.
    Afterwards, he opened several painting collections sent by the Chinese delegation. He carefully looked at the reproductions of the Dunhuang murals and Qi Baishi's ink paintings page by page, praising the long-standing Chinese painting art and the exquisite reproduction technology.
    Wang Xuetao, a painter in the Chinese cultural delegation, bought a well-printed Picasso painting album in Paris and brought it all the way to Cannes, hoping to get Picasso's autograph as a souvenir when he met him. At this time, Wang Xuetao took out the painting album. Picasso sat next to a long table, picked up a pencil that could change colors, and immediately drew a dove holding an olive branch in its mouth on the title page. His interest was still not exhausted, and he imitated Wang Xuetao's business card, copying Wang's Chinese signature stroke by stroke. His brushwork seemed quite skilled, which surprised us all. Picasso said that he often uses a brush to paint and write, sometimes for several hours, and he thinks those are like Chinese characters.
    Chinese female singer Lang Yuxiu sang two Chinese folk songs for him. Picasso sat on the sofa listening attentively, and after listening, he walked up to Lang Yuxiu and kissed her forehead, thanking her repeatedly.
    When saying goodbye, Picasso personally escorted the delegation to the door. At the door, he deeply broke off a bunch of green osmanthus branches and gave them to the head of the delegation, Hou Debang, and kept waving to us at the door until the car started.
    That afternoon, we made a special trip to visit the kiln factory that produces the pottery designed and painted by Picasso. This factory is called "Madoura" and is located in the town of Vallauris near Cannes. The form of Madoura's house is old and unique, and there are two rooms inside displaying pottery designed or painted by Picasso. The back of the house is a studio, where the people working here are all artists. They make blanks, glaze them, and then send them into electric furnaces for firing. The price of Picasso's pottery is tens of thousands of francs to hundreds of thousands of francs or more, and people come here to visit in an endless stream.
    Although we were leaving Cannes that evening to return to Paris, we decided to rush to the Antibes Museum, dozens of kilometers away from Cannes, to see Picasso's paintings there, because this museum is the most important Picasso collection in France, preserving 116 of Picasso's paintings of all sizes, and 45 pieces of pottery.
    There is an interesting story behind being able to gather so many of Picasso's works. The curator told us that the museum was established in 1928 after he bought an ancient castle belonging to the government, and it was originally just an unknown private modern art gallery. After World War II, he met Picasso on the beach. At that time, the painter was worried because there was no place for him to paint murals. The owner immediately invited Picasso to live and paint in the castle, and he only wanted to get a painting by Picasso to be satisfied. Unexpectedly, Picasso lived for a full five months from August to December 1946, and painted hundreds of paintings, from large-scale murals to sketches and lithographs, and left them all to the owner. This museum has thus become the most famous museum in the world with the most Picasso works.
    The layout of the museum still retains the characteristics of the ancient castle, with a very elegant style. The azure blue of the Mediterranean Sea shines in from the small windows of the ancient castle, further enhancing the atmosphere of the exhibition.
    A whole day of visits related to Picasso left us with a strong impression. The evaluation of Picasso's art needs to be done by artists; and his dedication to the cause of the working class and his contribution to the peace movement show that he is a truly people's artist. (Attached picture)

    访问毕卡索
    姚云
    在法国的艺术生活中，处处可以感觉到毕卡索的存在和影响。几乎每一个美术馆都必不可少地陈列着他的作品，书店里有着各种各样的毕卡索画册；模仿毕卡索，在陶磁业中已经成为风尚；在今年的戛纳国际电影节，又有一部关于毕卡索的电影得了奖。帕勃洛·毕卡索，这位杰出的画家，传布在全世界的“和平鸽”的作者，原籍是西班牙，现在定居在法国。从1944年以来，他就是法国共产党的党员。
    七月中旬，中国文化代表团在访问了巴黎、里昂、马赛这些大城市以后，来到了地中海滨的戛纳。这里，蓝色的海湾像晶莹的宝石似的镶嵌在黄金色的沙滩和绿色的棕榈树之间。阳光把鲜明的光彩投向盛开的花草和果木。选择在这个地方工作和生活的毕卡索一向为频繁的访问者所苦，但是，他很高兴接待来自中国的朋友们。
    毕卡索的住宅在戛纳一座名叫加利福尼的小山头上，距离海滨只有几分钟的汽车路程。趟进他的院子，就可以看到在那座楼房的门里门外放着他不少的雕塑和已经包装好准备运走的艺术品。一位穿着蓝色的短袖敞领衬衫、粗布裤子的矮小的老人从楼上走下来，把手伸向中国文化代表团的团员们，这就是毕卡索。他生于1881年，今年已经七十五岁，但是，他的目光仍旧深沉锐利，步子轻捷而又稳健。他的手掌是劳动者和艺术家的手掌，几十年的绘画和雕塑生活把他的皮肤磨练得那么坚韧。
    画家马上把我们带进他的工作室，让我们随便观赏他的作品。这间屋子原来是住宅的客厅，现在里面到处堆满了东西。好几个画架竖立在那里，上面有他画的人像和构图。桌子上，墙角落里，地板上，一堆一堆地放着他设计和绘制的陶瓶、陶盆和雕塑，一切都显示出画家的惊人创作力以及他在艺术实践上的努力。
    在房间正中地板上放着一只鸟笼，两只洁白的幼鸽正在里面跳跃。毕卡索提起笼子，告诉我们这是一位朋友送给他的。大家自然地想起了毕卡索所画的飞翔的“和平鸽”，它已经成为各国人民保卫和平的决心和意志的象征。我们对他说，和平鸽也在全中国到处飞翔。毕卡索微笑了，眼睛里闪烁着柔和的光芒，富有深意地注视着那两只欢乐地跳动不已的鸽子。
    乘这次会见的机会，中国文化代表团团长侯德榜把从中国带来的一份礼品送给毕卡索表示我们的敬意。毕卡索打开纸包，里面是一只朱红色的福建漆的小花瓶，他拿起来一看，非常敏锐地说：“这个瓶子的颜色很好。”跟着，他迅速地走前几步，又把这只瓶子和他自己绘制的一只蓝色的陶瓶并排放在一起。两只瓶子的颜色形成强烈的对比，各有自己的特色。
    随后，他打开中国代表团送的几份画集。他认真地、一页一页观看敦煌壁画和齐白石的水墨画的复制品，称赞具有悠久历史的中国绘画艺术和精美的复制技术。
    中国文化代表团中的画家王雪涛在巴黎时就买了一本精印的毕卡索画集，一路带到戛纳，希望能在会见毕卡索时请他签个名作为纪念。这时，王雪涛把画集拿出来了。毕卡索坐到一张长桌子的旁边，拿起一枝可以变换颜色的铅笔，立即在扉页上画了一幅嘴里衔着橄榄叶的鸽子。他兴致未尽，又仿照王雪涛的名片，把王的中文签名式一笔一笔临摹下来。他的笔法似乎相当熟练，使我们都感到惊异。毕卡索说，他常常使用毛笔画写涂抹，有时连写几个钟头，他以为那些就像中国字。
    中国女歌唱家郎毓秀为他唱了两首中国民歌。毕卡索坐在沙发上凝神倾听，听完后走到郎毓秀的面前吻吻她的额角，连声道谢。
    告别的时候，毕卡索亲自把代表团送到门口，他在门边深情地折下一束青青的桂枝，送给侯德榜团长，一直到汽车开动，还在门口向我们不断招手。
    当天下午，我们又专程去看制作毕卡索所设计和绘画的陶器的窑厂。这个厂名叫“玛多拉”，设在戛纳附近的瓦洛里斯镇上。玛多拉的屋子的形式古老而别致，里面有两间房子陈列着毕卡索设计或绘制的陶器。屋子的后部是工作室，在这里工作的都是艺术家，他们做胚子，上釉彩，然后送进电炉烧制。毕卡索的陶器的标价在几万法朗以至几十万法朗以上，慕名来这里参观的人川流不息。
    虽然当天傍晚我们就要离开戛纳回巴黎，但是，我们还是决意赶到离戛纳有好几十公里的翁提布美术馆去看那里的毕卡索的画，因为这个美术馆是法国最重要的毕卡索作品收藏处，保存在这里的有毕卡索大大小小的画一百一十六幅，陶器四十五件。
    能够集中这么多的毕卡索的作品是有一个有趣的故事的。馆长告诉我们，这个博物馆是他买下属于政府的一座古堡后，在1928年建立的，原来不过是一所没没无名的私人近代艺术馆。第二次世界大战后，他在海滩上遇到毕卡索，当时这位画家正因为没有地方可供他作壁画而烦恼。主人于是立刻邀请毕卡索到古堡居住和作画，他只想能得到毕卡索的一幅画就心满意足了。想不到毕卡索从1946年8月到12月，住了整整五个月，画了上百幅画，从大幅的壁画到素描、石版画都有，全部留下来送给了主人。这个美术馆于是一跃而为全世界收藏毕卡索作品最多的一所著名美术馆了。
    美术馆的布置仍旧保持着古堡的特色，具有十分典雅的风格。地中海的蔚蓝色从古堡的小窗中映照进来，更加强了展览的气氛。
    和毕卡索有关的一整天的访问参观为我们留下了强烈的印象。对于毕卡索的艺术的评价，需得美术家们来做；而他的献身于工人阶级的事业以及他在保卫和平运动中的贡献，表明他是一个真正人民的艺术家。（附图片）
