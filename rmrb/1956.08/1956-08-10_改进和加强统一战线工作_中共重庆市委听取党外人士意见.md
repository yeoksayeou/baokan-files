Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 9th: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is improving and strengthening the United Front work based on the criticisms and suggestions from local organizations of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages.

On the 6th, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC invited the heads of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing to hold a forum to solicit opinions on improving the United Front work. Prior to this, the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee also held a forum, inviting the heads of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages to offer their opinions on the United Front work.

Based on the criticisms and suggestions put forward by non-party figures, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC has adopted measures to improve the United Front work. In order to effectively overcome the shortcomings of cooperation between Communist Party members and non-Party figures, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC has urged all departments to universally convey to Communist Party members the CPC Central Committee's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and various democratic parties. The United Front Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee has initially checked the relationship with democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, and is currently formulating specific plans to improve shortcomings. After consultation with the heads of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee has formulated a plan to assist democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in conducting political theory studies from 1956 to 1957, and has begun to gradually implement it. The daily contact between the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee and non-party figures has now been gradually strengthened. In addition, the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee also assists various democratic parties in carrying out social liaison work and developing their organizations. The Chongqing Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has a weak mass base in the Chongqing medical and health circles, and has difficulties in carrying out its work. With the help of the Communist Party organizations in the Municipal United Front Work Department and the Municipal Health Bureau, they have quickly become familiar with the situation of people in the city's medical and health circles, established contacts, and recently developed a group of new members from among them.

At present, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC has decided to further universally convey and discuss the CPC Central Committee's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and various democratic parties in the city's Party organizations, so as to implement it in the city's grassroots Party organizations.

    改进和加强统一战线工作
    中共重庆市委听取党外人士意见
    新华社重庆9日电　中共重庆市委员会正根据各民主党派地方组织和无党派民主人士的批评建议，改进和加强统一战线工作。
    中共重庆市委员会在六日邀请各民主党派在重庆的地方组织的负责人举行座谈会，征求对改进统一战线工作的意见。在这以前，市委统战部也曾召开座谈会，请各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士对统一战线工作提意见。
    根据党外人士提出的批评和建议，中共重庆市委员会采取了改进统一战线工作的措施。为了有效地克服共产党员与党外人士在合作共事方面的缺点，中共重庆市委员会督促各部门普遍向共产党员传达中共中央关于共产党与各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，中共重庆市委统战部已初步检查了同民主党派和无党派民主人士的关系的情况，目前正在制定改进缺点的具体规划。市委统战部经过与各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士磋商后，已订出了1956年到1957年帮助民主党派和无党派民主人士进行政治理论学习的规划，并已开始逐步实行。市委统战部和党外人士的日常联系方面，现在已逐步加强。另外，市委统战部还帮助各民主党派展开社会联系工作和发展组织的工作。中国农工民主党重庆市工作委员会在重庆市医药卫生界中群众基础较薄弱，开展工作有困难。在市委统战部和市卫生局中的共产党组织帮助下，他们已很快地熟悉了全市医药卫生界人士的情况，建立了联系，并在最近从中发展了一批新成员。
    目前，中共重庆市委员会决定在全市党组织中进一步普遍传达和讨论中共中央关于共产党与各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，以便在全市党的基层组织中贯彻。
