Xinhua News Agency, Yining, August 20th: The Kazakh and other ethnic peoples in the Altai Mountain region of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have reported bumper harvests in both animal husbandry and agriculture this year.

Their livestock numbers have increased to 1,304,000 head this year, with an average survival rate of over 96% for young animals. In the first half of the year, the region saw a net increase of 431,200 head of various livestock. The grain produced from the region's 397,000 mu of farmland is sufficient not only for consumption but also for storing enough surplus grain for a year's needs. Farmers and herdsmen have now begun harvesting the newly ripened wheat. The wheat growing on the region's 240,000 mu is doing very well, with an average yield of over 170 jin per mu, an increase of 40 to 50 jin compared to last year.

The People's Government has been supporting local farmers and herdsmen with a large number of sheep, seeds, new-style animal-powered farm tools, and loans. In the first half of this year alone, over 600,000 yuan in agricultural loans were issued. In addition, the People's Government has also organized the surplus labor force of farmers and herdsmen to develop various sideline productions to support the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.

The Altai Mountain region includes seven counties: Altay, Burqin, Habahe, Fuyun, Qinghe, Fuhai, and Jimunai. It is now a special district under the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. In the past, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups here were very poor. The armed spy of American imperialism, Usman, a degenerate element among the Kazakh nationality, occupied this place for many years, engaging in riots, and the people suffered severely. At the beginning of Xinjiang's liberation, the region had only 380,000 head of various livestock and only 110,000 mu of farmland. In the past few years, thanks to the stabilization of social order and the correct implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies and various policies related to animal husbandry, the people of all ethnic groups in the Altai Mountain region have gradually restored and developed production with the support of the state.

    阿尔泰山地区牧业农业都丰收
    据新华社伊宁20日电　新疆维吾尔自治区阿尔泰山地区哈萨克等族人民，今年畜牧业和农业都告丰收。
    今年他们的各种牲畜已增加到一百三十万零四千多头，幼畜成活率今年普遍达到96％以上，上半年全区净增各种牲畜四十三万一千二百多头。全区三十九万七千多亩农田所产的粮食，除食用外，还可积存足够一年需用的余粮。现在，农、牧民们已开始收割刚刚成熟的小麦。全区二十四万多亩小麦长的很好，平均每亩各收一百七十多斤，比去年增产四十到五十斤。
    人民政府以大量羊只、种籽、新式畜力农具和贷款扶助这里的农牧民。今年上半年仅发放的农业贷款就有六十多万元。此外人民政府还组织农牧民剩余劳动力开展多种副业生产，支援农牧业的发展。
    阿尔泰山地区包括阿勒泰、布尔津、哈巴河、富蕴、青河、福海、吉木乃七个县，现在是伊犁哈萨克族自治州所属的一个专区。过去这里各族人民的生活是十分贫困的。美帝国主义武装间谍、哈萨克民族中的败类乌斯满匪徒，曾经多年盘踞这里暴乱，人民遭难十分严重。新疆解放初期，全区各种牲畜只剩下三十八万多头，农田也只有十一万多亩。几年来，由于安定了社会秩序，正确贯彻执行了中国共产党的民族政策和畜牧业等各项政策，阿尔泰山各族人民在国家的扶助下，逐步恢复和发展了生产。
