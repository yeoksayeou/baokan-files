Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 20th. Following the West German authorities' announcement on August 17th of the banning of the German Communist Party, many cities in the German Democratic Republic have successively held large-scale rallies and demonstrations protesting this fascist decision by the West German authorities.

　　Magdeburg held a protest rally of 100,000 people on August 18th. On the same day, Karl Marx Stadt also held a mass meeting attended by 80,000 people.

　　In Aufatt, 50,000 people held a demonstration demanding the revocation of the verdict banning the German Communist Party. A rally held after the demonstration passed an appeal to the working people of both parts of Germany, calling on them to continue to fight for the establishment of a unified and democratic Germany.

　　A mass meeting attended by 20,000 people in Schwerin unanimously adopted a resolution demanding that the West German Federal Parliament immediately revoke this unconstitutional verdict and restore the democratic rights of the West German people.

　　Jena, Rostock, Weimar and other cities also held protest rallies.

　　The Democratic Women's Federation of Germany and the German Peace Council have both issued statements protesting this reactionary measure by the West German authorities.

　　Many non-Party workers in the German Democratic Republic have requested to join the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to strengthen the party's ranks. In the German Democratic Republic, more than 700 working people submitted such applications in just one day or so after the West German authorities announced the banning of the German Communist Party.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 19th.　Ignoring the ban order of the Bonn government, the local organization of the German Communist Party in Munich held a mass meeting in Munich, West Germany, on the evening of August 17th. Hundreds of workers, young people, and women fearlessly flocked to the meeting place. Despite police patrols and guards near the venue, a solemn voice still came from the loudspeakers in front of the venue: "Despite the ban, the German Communist Party will not be eliminated!"

　　Inside the venue, people's emotions were boiling. Schellinger, the first secretary of the Bavarian State Committee of the German Communist Party, was held high on the shoulders of several workers, and he spoke to the people present: "We believe that banning our proud German Communist Party is unconstitutional. Our party was banned because it firmly opposed the policy of military build-up and universal conscription. In any case, the ban on our party cannot save the bankruptcy of the Adenauer government's policies." He finally shouted: "Long live the German Communist Party!"

　　When the police received orders to ban the meeting, Schellinger safely left the venue under the cover of the workers. It took the police more than an hour to disperse the meeting.

    新华社柏林20日电　在西德当局八月十七日宣布取缔德国共产党以后，民主德国的许多城市接连举行大规模集会和示威，抗议西德当局的这个法西斯式的决定。
    马格德堡在八月十八日举行了一次十万人的抗议大会。同一天，卡尔·马克思斯塔德也举行了一次有八万人参加的群众大会。
    在欧法特，有五万人举行游行示威，要求撤销关于禁止德国共产党的判决。示威以后举行的一次集会上通过了致德国两个部分的劳动人民的呼吁书，要求他们继续为建立一个统一、民主的德国而斗争。
    在什未林举行的一次有两万人参加的群众大会上一致通过了决议，要求西德联邦议院立即撤销这个违反宪法的判决，并且恢复西德人民的民主权利。
    耶纳、罗斯托克及魏玛等城市也举行了抗议大会。
    德国民主妇女联合会和德国和平理事会都发表声明，抗议西德当局的这个反动措施。
    民主德国许多非党工人纷纷要求加入德国统一社会党以加强党的队伍。仅在西德当局宣布取缔德国共产党后一天左右的时间内，民主德国就有七百多个劳动人民提出了这样的申请。
    新华社柏林19日电　不顾波恩政府的取缔令，德国共产党慕尼黑市的地方组织八月十七日晚上在西德慕尼黑市举行了一次群众大会。几百个工人、青年和妇女毫无畏惧地涌向会场。尽管会场附近有警察巡逻、警戒，会场门前的扩音器中仍然传出了庄严的声音：“尽管取缔，德国共产党是不会消灭的！”
    会场内，人们的情绪沸腾着，德国共产党巴伐利亚州委会第一书记谢林根被几个工人高高地举在肩头上，他就这样向到会的人说话了：“我们认为取缔我们引以自豪的德国共产党是违反宪法的。我们的党被取缔了，因为它坚决反对整军和实行普遍兵役的政策。不管怎样，对我们党的取缔绝不能挽救阿登纳政府政策的破产。”他最后高喊：“德国共产党万岁！”
    当警察接到命令禁止这个集会时，谢林根在工人的掩护下安全地离开了会场。警察费了一个多小时的功夫才驱散了这个集会。
