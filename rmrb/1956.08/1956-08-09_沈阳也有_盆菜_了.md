    Shenyang Also Has "Pun Choi" Now
    (Our report) The Heping District Non-Staple Food Store of the Shenyang Municipal Local Trade Company, learning from the experience of Shanghai's vegetable markets in selling "Pun Choi," has added a "Pun Choi Sales Group" in the Daquanlou Store of Heping District to supply "Pun Choi."
    On the first day of supply, the "Pun Choi" included twenty-eight kinds of dishes that people liked, such as glazed three ingredients, braised fish, braised eggplant, "all-in-the-family happiness," and winter mushroom chicken. A pot of vegetables costs from 12 cents to about 35 cents, which is not only cheap but also uses good raw materials. This "Pun Choi" has undergone all the preparation processes before cooking, such as washing, cutting, etc. The salespersons who sell "Pun Choi" can all cook. For example, Du Yuncheng, who is in charge of ingredients, has been a chef for many years. If customers don't know how to cook, they also introduce the methods. (Heli)

    沈阳也有“盆菜”了
    本报讯　沈阳市地方贸易公司和平区副食品商店，学习上海市菜场出售“盆菜”的经验，在和平区大圈楼商店增设了“盆菜售货小组”，供应“盆菜”。
    开始供应的第一天，“盆菜”有熘三样，红烧鱼、烧茄子、全家福、冬菇鸡等二十八种人们喜欢吃的菜。一盆菜从一角二分钱到三角五分钱左右，不仅价廉，而且是选用的好原料。这种“盆菜”都经过了洗、切……等烹饪前的一切准备过程。卖“盆菜”的营业员都会做菜，如配料的杜云程是多年的厨师。如果顾客不会做菜，他们还介绍做法。　（合里）
