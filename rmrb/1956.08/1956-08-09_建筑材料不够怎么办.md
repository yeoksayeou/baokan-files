Editorial: What to do when there are not enough building materials

　　This year, all kinds of building materials are in short supply, the most lacking being steel, followed by wood and cement, and even pig iron, which was previously considered to be no problem, is now insufficient. This situation has brought difficulties to some construction projects and production enterprises.
　　Why is there such a serious difficulty? Is it that the production of building materials has developed slowly? This is not the main reason. In 1952, China's steel output was 1.11 million tons, and this year's planned output is 3.645 million tons, an increase of 2.535 million tons, which is 600,000 tons more than the 1957 target set in the Five-Year Plan. Take cement as an example. This year's planned output is 6.3 million tons, an increase of 3.44 million tons over the 1952 output, exceeding the 1957 target set in the Five-Year Plan by 300,000 tons. The situation of timber production is roughly the same. This shows that the development of China's building materials production is very rapid. So where exactly is the problem? Specifically, the problem lies in the plan. This year's annual capital construction and production plan exceeded the possibility of equipment and material supply. To put it plainly, some plans were overambitious. This year's capital construction investment increased by 62% compared with last year, and the output value of the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 73%, making the demand for steel increase by 69% and cement by 59% compared with last year. However, the growth rate (planned) of steel production this year is 50%, and that of cement (planned) is 43%. This shows that the demand far exceeds the possible limit, which is the main reason for the supply-demand imbalance. Why is the plan so big? Simply put, when making the plan, it was not based on the principle of supply and demand balance to place the plan on the basis of sufficient material supply. This lesson tells us that in any work, we must combine needs and possibilities, and in our work, we must not only oppose right-leaning conservatism, but also oppose left-leaning rashness.
　　The reason why we want to explain the situation in this regard at this time is to make all construction units prepare ideologically to overcome difficulties. Because this year's national material balance and allocation work has basically ended, the materials allocated are far from the needs of some departments, and in the future, we can only strive for individual and small adjustments, and there will be no universal and large-scale supplements. If all regions still squeeze upwards desperately like in the first and second quarters, and pin all their hopes on increasing distribution, this hope will be dashed. Conversely, if everyone understands the basic situation of current material supply, then when encountering difficulties, they will not only look upwards, but will actively think of ways to overcome difficulties.
　　So, what is the method to solve the shortage of building materials? Everyone will naturally think of increasing production. This year, all production enterprises have indeed made their best efforts, especially in the production of steel and wood, and it seems that there is not much potential to be tapped. However, the leading staff and all employees of the relevant enterprises must not see this as absolutely absolute. Judging from the work of promoting advanced experience alone, there is still much to be done. Taking cement production as an example, No. 3 kiln of Guangzhou Cement Plant has been running safely for 367 days for a long time, while No. 1 and No. 2 kilns in the same plant are far behind this record. No. 1 kiln of Jiangnan Cement Plant has been running safely for more than 500 days, and other kilns in the plant are far behind this kiln. The long-term operation of wet cement kilns across the country varies greatly. Some are as high as 500 days, some are as low as 20 or 30 days, and the overall average is only 68 days. In fact, the differences in technical conditions of these kilns are not significant. If the operation period of cement kilns under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry can strive to reach an average of 100 days, the annual cement production can be increased by 275,000 tons. In enterprises producing steel, cement, and wood, there are many advanced experiences and many new records have appeared. As long as these enterprises can popularize advanced experience and organize backward ones to look up to advanced indicators, they can still increase a lot of output.
　　The exchange and adjustment of building materials must also be done well. At present, there are still some materials and stagnant materials accumulated in various enterprises. At the beginning of this year, because everyone called "materials are tight", many units wanted to keep a hand for emergency needs. In fact, it is not necessary to do so. This approach is not good for others or oneself. Now, many departments, provinces, and cities have started to adjust materials, and the effect is very significant. For example, the comrades of the supply section of the Fourth Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry took the initiative to borrow nearly 100 tons of steel from other units, ensuring that the project in April and May reached the planned progress. According to the work of various places in this regard, whether it is local adjustment between enterprises, or the industrial departments in charge first carry out adjustment within their own system, or the local party organizations and people's committees organize exchanges between enterprises in a region, many problems can be solved. This especially requires opposing departmentalism. In this way, the difficulty of insufficient materials will be overcome to a large extent.
　　Another way to overcome material difficulties is to carry out mass campaigns to save raw materials. There are many ways to save raw materials. Rationally and sparingly using materials is one aspect, and using substitutes and using waste materials is also a very important aspect. In the first half of the year, capital construction units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company saved 4,000 tons of steel and cement each using the above methods. Young employees of more than 40 factories in Harbin launched activities to collect and utilize waste steel, and according to the statistics of only six units, 561 tons of old steel were utilized. However, at present, the phenomenon of waste of materials is still common on construction sites and in production enterprises: there are also many good methods for saving and using substitutes that have not been widely promoted. We hope that the leaders of construction sites and production enterprises will quickly organize all employees and set off a wave of saving raw materials. If this is done, a large number of materials will be saved.
　　Of course, some construction plans are inherently too high and cannot be completed, and must be reduced. It is best for all departments to line up their own projects, and some projects must be cut to ensure the completion of projects that are of great significance to next year's production and major projects. However, we do not advocate average reduction of the plan. Because if the plan is reduced on average, the plan may not be completed at all; on the contrary, concentrating all materials to complete major projects can bring investment results as soon as possible. Any hasty, negligent, or simplistic approach in this regard will bring losses to the country, so the more cautious, the better.
　　At the same time, whether increasing production, saving, or adjusting various building materials, it is necessary to ensure the quality of products and projects. It can be imagined that if the increased production of materials is not up to standard, or if the quality of the project is reduced due to saving materials, even if many problems are solved, what is the point!

### 建筑材料不够怎么办

    建筑材料不够怎么办
    今年，各种建筑材料都供不应求，最缺少的是钢材，木材、水泥次之，连过去认为无问题的生铁也感到不足了。这种情况，已经给某些建设工程和生产企业带来了困难。
    为什么会发生这样严重的困难呢？是不是建筑材料的生产发展的慢了？这不是主要的原因。1952年我国钢材产量是一百一十一万吨，今年计划产量是三百六十四万五千吨，增加二百五十三万五千吨，比五年计划规定的1957年指标多六十万吨。再以水泥为例，今年计划产量是六百三十万吨，比1952年产量增加三百四十四万吨，超过五年计划规定的1957年指标三十万吨。木材生产的情况也大体如此。这说明我国建筑材料生产的发展是很快的。那么问题究竟发生在什么地方呢？具体说来，问题发生在计划上，今年年度的基本建设和生产计划超过了设备、材料供应的可能，说得明白些，就是有些计划冒进了。今年基本建设投资比去年增长62％，机械制造工业产值增长73％，使钢材的需要量比去年增长69％、水泥增长59％。而今年钢材生产的增长率（计划）是50％，水泥（计划）是43％。这说明需要量大大超过了可能的限度，这是发生供需失调的主要原因。为什么把计划订的这样大呢？简单地说，在订计划的时候，没有根据供求平衡的原则把计划安放在物资充分供应的基础上。这个教训告诉我们：进行任何一种工作，都要使需要和可能结合起来，在工作中既要反对右倾保守，也要反对左倾冒进。
    我们所以要在这个时候交代这方面的情况，就是要使各兴工单位在思想上作克服困难的准备。因为，今年国家的物资平衡和调拨的工作已经基本上结束，分配下去的物资和某些部门的需要量相差很远，今后也只能是争取极个别的、少量的调剂，不会进行普遍的和大量的补充了。各地如果还像一、二季度那样拼命挤上边，把全部希望寄托在增加分配上，这种希望是会落空的。反过来，如果大家弄清了当前材料供应的基本状况，那末在遇到困难的时候就不会只是眼睛向上，就会积极想办法克服困难了。
    那末，解决建筑材料不足的方法是什么呢？大家自然就会想到增产。今年各生产企业确已尽了最大的努力，特别是钢材和木材的生产，似乎没有多少潜力可挖了。但是，有关企业的领导工作人员和全体职工，万万不能把此事看的这样绝对。单从推广先进经验的工作来看，仍然大有可为。以水泥生产为例，广州水泥厂三号窑曾长期安全运转367天，而同厂内的一、二号窑和这个纪录相差很远。江南水泥厂一号窑已安全运转五百天以上，本厂其他的窑也远远落在这个窑的后面。全国湿法水泥窑长期运转的情况悬殊很大，有的高达五百天，有的低到二十天或三十天，总平均不过六十八天。事实上，这些窑在技术条件上的差别是不大的，如果建筑材料工业部所属水泥窑的运转期争取平均达到一百天，每年就可以增产水泥二十七万五千吨。在生产钢材、水泥、木材的企业里，都有许多先进经验，出现过不少新纪录，只要这些企业能够把先进经验普遍起来，组织落后的向先进的指标看齐，还是可以增加不少的产量。
    建筑材料的交流和调剂工作也要做好。现在，在各企业里，积压的材料和呆滞的物资还是有的。今年年初，由于大家都叫“材料紧张”，许多单位都想留一手，以备急需。其实大可不必如此，这种做法对人对己都不利。现在，已有不少部门、省、市着手进行调剂材料的工作，效果非常显著。例如冶金工业部建筑局第四工程公司供应科的同志，主动地到别的单位借用了近百吨钢材，保证了四、五月份的工程达到了计划的进度。根据各地进行这方面的工作情况看，无论是企业之间局部地进行调剂，或是各工业主管部门首先在自己系统内进行调剂，或者是由地方党组织、人民委员会在一个地区内组织各企业间的交流，都能解决不少问题。这就特别需要反对本位主义。这样，就会在很大程度上克服材料不足的困难。
    克服材料困难的另一个方法，是开展群众性的节约原材料的工作。节约原材料的方法很多，合理地节约地使用材料是一个方面，而利用代用品、利用废料也是一个很重要的方面。鞍山钢铁公司各基本建设单位在上半年，用上述方法节约了钢材、水泥各四千吨。哈尔滨市四十多个工厂的青年职工展开了搜集利用废钢材的活动，仅据六个单位的统计，即利用旧钢材561吨。但是，目前在建设工地上和生产企业里，依然普遍存在着浪费材料的现象：也有许多节约和利用代用品的好方法至今没有普遍推广。我们希望各建设工地和各生产企业中的领导人员，迅速把全体职工组织起来，掀起一个节约原材料的热潮。如果这样做，就一定会节省出大批的材料。
    当然，有的建筑计划本来就是过高的，不可能完成，势必要加以压缩。各部门最好都把自己的工程项目排一下队，必须削减一些工程，保证完成对明年生产有重要意义的和主要的工程。但是，我们也不主张平均削减计划。因为如果平均削减就可能全部完不成计划；反之集中所有材料去完成主要的工程，就可以及早发挥投资效果。这方面的任何草率、疏忽或简单化的做法，都会给国家带来损失，所以愈慎重愈好。
    同时，无论在增产、节约和调剂各种建筑材料的时候，都必须保证产品和工程的质量。可以设想，如果增产的材料不合格，或者因为节省材料而降低了工程质量，即使解决了不少的问题，那又有什么意义呢！
