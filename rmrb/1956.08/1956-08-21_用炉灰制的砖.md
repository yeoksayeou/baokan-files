    Bricks Made from Furnace Ash
    The Fushun Red Brick Factory has successfully trial-produced a new building material – ash slag bricks. These ash slag bricks are made from waste furnace ash and a small amount of lime. Their compressive strength, flexural strength, and other properties are the same as those of red bricks, but the cost is more than 41% lower than that of red bricks. These bricks do not need to be fired in a kiln and can be produced year-round.
    Fushun is a mining area and is not suitable for taking soil from the ground to make red bricks. In the past, the raw materials for brick making were transported from places such as Tieling and Liaoyang, which was very costly and could not meet the needs. At the same time, the Fushun Power Plant produces more than 1,000 tons of furnace ash every day, which has always been treated as waste. After the successful trial production of ash slag bricks, it is no longer necessary to transport raw materials from other places, and more than 1,000 tons of furnace ash can be fully utilized.

    用炉灰制的砖
    抚顺市红砖厂试制成功了一种新的建筑材料——灰渣砖。这种灰渣砖是用废炉灰和少量白灰制成的，抗压、抗折等性能都和红砖一样，但是成本却比红砖低41％以上。这种砖不用窑烧，可以长年生产。
    抚顺市是矿区，不适于从地面取土造红砖，过去制砖原料都是从铁岭、辽阳等地调运，成本很高，还不能满足需要。同时，抚顺发电厂日产炉灰一千多吨，又一向被当作废料处理。灰渣砖试制成功以后，不必再从外地调运原料，一千多吨炉灰也可以充分利用了。
