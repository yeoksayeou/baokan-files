    Emphasize the Production and Supply of Sports Equipment

    With the development of mass sports activities, the demand for sports goods is also increasing. However, the quantity and quality of sports goods produced at present are far from meeting the actual needs.
    First, sports goods are generally and chronically out of stock. The monthly production of footballs, basketballs, and volleyballs in Shanghai can only reach a quarter of the required quantity; many cities cannot buy horizontal bars and parallel bars. According to incomplete statistics from the China Cultural Goods General Company, 380,000 footballs, basketballs, and volleyballs were sold from January to May this year alone, accounting for 40.3% of the annual sales plan; however, only 310,000 were purchased during the same period, accounting for 37.8% of the annual purchase plan. It is estimated that the annual sales volume will reach 103% of the annual plan, while the purchase volume can only reach a maximum of 96% of the annual plan.
    Second, the quality of sports goods is poor, and the vast majority do not meet specifications. For example, for basketballs, among the 76 balls from 49 brands in 19 producing areas that were evaluated, only four balls of the "Huaguang," "Standard," and "Yan Yan" brands were close to the specified standards. The vast majority were either 5 to 9 centimeters short in circumference or 5 to 10 centimeters lighter in weight; there were also problems such as rough stitching, too-hard leather, and out-of-round shapes. As for footballs, among the 30 balls of 30 brands produced in 12 regions that were evaluated, not a single one met the specifications. Regarding the width of the iron parallel bars, those made by the Shanghai Mingxin Factory were 35.5-62.89 cm, those by the Tianjin Chunhe Factory were 37.8-52.5 cm, and those by the Guangzhou Dongshan Factory were 36.5-54 cm, none of which met the specified standard of 38.5-53.5 cm.
    The poor quality has turned some newly bought sports goods into waste. The "Soviet-style movable parallel bars" purchased by the Baoding City Stadium from the Beijing Cultural Goods Company last year had misaligned holes on the base plate; the "Soviet-style weightlifting equipment" purchased by the Hebei Provincial Sports Commission had too-thick barbell heads and too-small holes in the weight plates, making them unable to fit; the "German-style parallel bars" manufactured by the Guangzhou Dongshan Factory were not only crude and bulky in appearance with screws protruding from the bar surface, but the horizontal bar cracked during transportation from Guangzhou to Beijing. Due to the poor quality of sports goods, there have been many accidents involving falls, even fatal ones.
    Third, the prices of sports goods are also very chaotic. Products of the same quality, the same materials, and the same operating techniques have vastly different prices due to different regions. The 5601 brand first-grade volleyball made by the Harbin Brothers Sports Goods Factory is of poorer quality than the second-grade Yalu River brand volleyball produced by the Yalu River Factory, but the purchase price is 57% higher. The Soviet-style parallel bars made by the Tianjin Chunhe Factory are of the same quality as those produced by the Shanghai Mingxin Factory, but the purchase price is 65% higher than those produced by the Shanghai Mingxin Factory.
    The reason why sports goods are in short supply is not that the production capacity is insufficient. According to statistics from eight cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin, there are more than 190 sports goods manufacturing factories with more than 3,400 workers. Many factories in Shanghai that produce sports equipment reflect: After public-private partnerships, other factories are carrying out labor competitions to increase productivity, but only we dare not mention it. It's not that the workers don't have this demand, but that there is a shortage of raw materials. Workers in Baoding City who make sports goods often have no work to do due to insufficient raw materials. Those who make bladders switch to making small rubber balls, and those who make shells switch to making leather shoes and leather suitcases.
    Of course, it is indeed somewhat difficult to supply enough raw cowhide to factories producing sports equipment at present; however, there are alternative raw materials. Such as horsehide, pigskin, buffalo hide, etc. Although these materials have shortcomings such as being prone to expansion and hardening, they can be used to make balls for general practice after processing. Users have reported that pigskin balls made in Shanghai and Baoding are not bad. Of course, it is also necessary to appropriately supply some cowhide to solve the raw material problem for refined products and competition supplies. Furthermore, horizontal bars for parallel bars do not necessarily have to be made of imported wood. Domestic birch, ash, and Manchurian ash are also suitable as long as the materials are strictly selected and carefully processed. Therefore, the reason why sports goods are in short supply is mainly that the responsible industrial departments and raw material supply departments do not pay enough attention to the production of sports equipment, and the sales departments have not promptly reported the situation to the production departments.
    As for the poor quality of products, although there are certain technical difficulties, the fact that many factories are producing inferior products and emphasizing quantity over quality is also one of the fundamental reasons.
    The shortage of sports equipment and its poor quality are hindering the development of mass sports activities to a certain extent. It is recommended that relevant departments seriously study and solve these problems in order to gradually meet the growing needs of the people for sports goods.

    重视体育器材的生产和供应
    孔彬
    随着群众性体育运动的开展，体育用品的需要量也日益增加，但是目前体育用品的生产数量和质量，远远不能适应实际需要。
    第一，体育用品普遍的、长期的脱销。上海市足球、篮球、排球每月的生产数量只能达到需要数量的四分之一；许多城市都买不到单杠、双杠。据中国文化用品总公司不完全的统计，单足球、篮球、排球今年一到五月就销售了三十八万多个，占全年销售计划的40.3％；可是同一时期只购进了三十一万多个，占全年购进计划的37.8％。估计全年的销售量会达到年计划的103％，而购进量最多只能达到年计划的96％。
    第二，体育用品质量差，绝大部分不合规格。例如篮球，在评比过的十九个产地，四十九个牌号的七十六个球中，只有“华光”、“标准”、“眼燕”三个牌号的四个球接近规定的标准，绝大部分不是圆周小五到九公分，就是重量轻五到十公分；还有缝工粗糙、皮革太硬、球形不圆等毛病。又如足球，评比了十二地方出产的、三十个牌号的三十个球，竟没有一个合乎规格标准。铁质双杠两杠的宽度，上海明新厂造的是35.5—62.89公分，天津春和厂的是37.8—52.5公分，广州东山厂的是36.5—54公分，没有一付合乎规定的38.5—53.5公分的标准。
    质量的低劣，使一些新买的体育用品成了废物。保定市体育场去年在北京文化用品公司买的“苏式活动双杠”，底板上的眼对不齐；河北省体育运动委员会买的“苏式举重器”杠头粗，铁盘眼小，套不进；广州东山厂造的“德式双杠”不但外形粗糙笨重、螺丝突出杠面，而且从广州运到北京，横杠就裂了缝。由于体育用品的质量低劣，曾经发生过多次摔伤甚至摔死人的事故。
    第三，体育用品的价格也很混乱，同品、同料、同样操作技术的产品，由于地区不同，价格悬殊很大。哈尔滨兄弟体育用品厂造的5601牌一级排球，质量比鸭绿江厂出品的鸭绿江牌二级品还次，但是进价要高57％，天津春和厂造的苏式双杠和上海明新厂出的双杠质量相同，但是进价比上海明新厂出产的高65％。
    体育用品供不应求的原因，并不是生产能力不够。据上海、广州、天津等八个城市的统计，体育用品的制造厂有一百九十多家，工人三千四百多名。上海市不少生产体育器材的工厂反映：公私合营后，别的工厂都在开展劳动竞赛，提高生产率，只有我们不敢提。不是职工没有这种要求，而是原料不足。保定市做体育用品的工人由于原料不够经常发生没有活干的现象，做球胆的转做小橡皮球，做球壳的转做皮鞋、皮箱。
    当然，要供应生产体育器材的工厂足够的牛皮原料，目前确实有些困难；但是，可以代用的原料也是有的。如马皮、猪皮、水牛皮等，这些材料虽然有易涨、易硬等缺点，但是只要经过加工，制作一般练习用的球是完全可以的。上海、保定制的猪皮球，用户反映并不坏。当然适当地供应一部分牛皮，解决精制品及比赛用品的原料也是必要的。再如双杠横杠也并不是一定非用进口木材不可，我国产的桦木、水曲柳、麻粟等，只要选材严格，加工细致，同样是适用的。因此，体育用品供不应求的原因，主要是主管的工业部门和原料供应部门对体育器材的生产不够重视，而销售部门也没有及时地向生产部门反映情况。
    至于产品质量低劣，固然是由于技术上还有一定程度的困难，但是，不少工厂粗制滥造，重量不重质，也是根本原因之一。
    运动器材的供不应求和质量低劣，在一定程度上阻碍了群众性体育运动的开展。建议有关部门认真研究并且解决这些问题，以逐步满足人民群众对体育用品日益增长的需要。
