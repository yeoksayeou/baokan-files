Kunming, August 18th (by our reporter) The Mina Agricultural Cooperative in Qiubei County, Yunnan Province, has taken measures to help minority members with fewer work points increase their income. The Mina Cooperative is a united cooperative composed of six ethnic groups: Miao, Han, Tu, Sha, Nong, and Yi. According to a preliminary estimate, the total value of agricultural and sideline production this year has increased by 147.6% compared to last year, and 97.6% of members of all ethnic groups have increased their income. However, the increase in income among the various teams varies greatly. The Han Fourth Production Team, which lives in the plains area, has an average annual income of 112.86 yuan per laborer; the Miao Seventh Production Team, which lives in the mountainous area, has an average annual income of 62.62 yuan per laborer. The difference is 44.5%. The reasons for the income disparity are that, on the one hand, the Miao and Tu members live in mountainous areas with poorer production conditions and less advanced production technology than other ethnic groups. The Party branch and the cooperative management committee did not pay enough attention to the differences in production conditions between the mountainous ethnic groups and the plains ethnic groups, and did not earnestly help the mountainous ethnic groups solve various difficulties to enable them to work more and provide sufficient technical assistance. On the other hand, when formulating various labor quotas within the cooperative, specific research was not conducted based on the characteristics of the mountainous areas, which caused imbalances in distribution.

After inspection and discussion, the Mina Township Party Branch of the Chinese Communist Party decided to take the following measures to help members with fewer work points increase their income: (1) Transfer Miao members to participate in sideline production, such as transportation, mining phosphate rock, digging brick and tile kilns, and charcoal burning. (2) Help production teams living in mountainous areas improve production management and land cultivation, expand planting areas, and plan to have Miao and Tu production teams responsible for breeding to increase work points. (3) Rationally adjust quotas and increase work points for slopes and distant lands. (4) Mobilize Miao and Tu members to accumulate more fertilizer and find pig feed for the cooperative in their spare time, re-evaluate and award work points; and develop the production of cash crops in Miao and Tu production teams. In addition, help Miao and Tu members develop household sideline occupations, and provide loans from credit cooperatives to solve the lack of capital.

In this way, the income of Miao and Tu members can be increased by more than 29%. The Miao and Tu members were very moved, and all the members were also very satisfied.

    密纳民族联合农业社采取措施
    帮助少数民族社员增加收入
    本报昆明18日电　云南丘北县密纳农业社采取措施，帮助工分少的少数民族社员增加收入。密纳社是由苗、汉、土、沙、侬、彝等六个民族组成的民族联合社。最近，经过初步估产试算，今年农副业的总产值比去年增加147.6％，有97.6％的各族社员增加了收入。但是，各队增加收入的情况却有很大悬殊。住在坝区的汉族第四生产队，平均每个劳动力全年收入112.86元；住在山区的苗族第七生产队，平均每个劳动力全年收入62.62元。两下相差44.5％。收入悬殊的原因，一方面是苗、土两族社员住在山区，生产条件较差，生产技术也比其它民族落后。党支部和社管理委员会对山区民族和坝区民族在生产条件上的差异注意不够，没有认真去帮助山区民族解决各种困难，让他们多出工，在技术上的帮助也不够。另一方面是在制定社内各种劳动定额时，也没有根据山区特点具体研究，这些都造成了分配中的不平衡现象。
    中共密纳乡党支部经过检查讨论后，决定采取以下措施，帮助工分少的社员多增加收入。（一）抽调苗族社员参加副业生产。如搞运输、挖磷矿石、挖烧砖瓦的窑、烧炭等。（二）帮助住在山区的生产队搞好生产管理和土地的加工，扩大栽种面积，并有计划地让苗、土族生产队负责饲养工作增加工分。（三）合理调整定额，提高坡地、远地的工分。（四）发动苗、土族社员在空闲时间多积肥，找猪菜给社，重新评给工分；并在苗、土族生产队发展技术作物的生产。此外，还帮助苗、土族社员发展家庭副业，缺少成本的由信用社贷款解决。
    这样，苗、土族社员的收入可提高29％以上。苗、土族社员很感动，全体社员也很满意。
