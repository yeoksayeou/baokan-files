French Foreign Minister Pineau flew back to Paris on the evening of the 18th to report on the progress of the meeting to Prime Minister Mollet. On the 19th, he hurried back to London and held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Martino. Sources say that Italy is also preparing to propose a solution to the canal issue.

Menon, the head of the Indian delegation, who is also said to be presenting another solution at the meeting on the 20th, met with Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov on the 19th, and then met with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd.

Abdulgani said on the evening of the 19th that Indonesia supports the Soviet proposal for convening an international conference with broad representation because the conference to resolve the canal issue must have Egypt's participation.

    各国代表团在伦敦接触频繁
    杜勒斯为西方的“国际管理”计划进行紧张活动
    据说梅农将向伦敦会议提出解决方案
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：在八月十九日伦敦会议休会的这一天，各方面代表进行了频繁的接触，为第二天的会议作准备。有消息说，那次会议将是一个决定性的会议，有好几种解决苏彝士运河问题的不同的方案将在这次会议上提出。
    准备代表西方三国提出一个要会议支持“国际管理”的宣言草案的美国代表团团长杜勒斯和日本外务相重光会谈了一小时。事后，重光向记者说，他同意美国提出的这个宣言体现的精神。
    美国代表团其他人员也广泛地同各国代表团就美国的宣言进行了交谈。这个宣言早在十八日晚上已经散发给各国代表团。
    法国外交部长比诺在十八日晚上曾经飞回巴黎向总理摩勒报告会议进行情况。十九日，他又匆匆回到伦敦，并且同意大利外交部长马蒂诺进行了会谈。有消息说，意大利也在准备提出一个解决运河问题的方案。
    据说也要在二十日会议上提出另一个解决方案的印度代表团团长梅农，在十九日同苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫会谈后，又会晤了英国外交大臣劳埃德。他还同目前在伦敦的埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里见了面。
    巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里会见了印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼和伊朗外交大臣阿达兰。据说，乔德里同约旦和伊拉克驻伦敦的外交使节也有约会。
    埃塞俄比亚外交大臣哈普特沃德也同阿卜杜加尼和阿达兰会了面。
    这一天，埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里除访问了谢皮洛夫并且同印度外交部秘书长皮莱会谈外，晚上又同阿卜杜加尼讨论了美国的宣言。
    阿卜杜加尼在十九日晚上说，印度尼西亚支持苏联关于召开具有广泛代表性的国际会议的建议，因为解决运河问题的会议必须有埃及参加。据参加伦敦会议的人士透露，印度尼西亚代表团是在周末试探过其他亚非国家代表团的意见，并且缜密地研究过美国的建议后，才肯定这个看法的。
