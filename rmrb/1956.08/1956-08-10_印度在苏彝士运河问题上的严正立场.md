    India's Solemn Stance on the Suez Canal Issue
    Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue on the 8th, supporting Egypt's action to reclaim the Suez Canal and clarifying India's position on participating in the London conference proposed by Britain, France, and the United States. Prime Minister Nehru's righteous statement will undoubtedly be valued and welcomed by all those concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.
    In his statement, Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the Suez Canal is an inseparable part of Egypt, and therefore, Egypt's sovereignty is beyond doubt. He also pointed out that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company by Egypt falls within the scope of the Egyptian government's authority. Prime Minister Nehru said that the Indian government recognizes that Egypt cannot and will not participate in the London conference because it is only an invitee to this conference, and it was not consulted on the issue of convening the conference. He pointed out that this conference cannot reach a final decision because that requires Egypt's consent.
    Prime Minister Nehru's opinions, which fully respect Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, are entirely correct. The London conference proposed by Britain, France, and the United States aims to discuss the so-called "international control" of the Suez Canal. However, the Suez Canal is part of Egyptian territory, and the management of the canal is Egypt's sovereignty. Therefore, what the London conference attempts to discuss is essentially the issue of Egypt's sovereignty, and no country's sovereignty can be discussed by others. The attempt by Britain, France, and the United States to discuss the issue of Egypt's sovereignty, and to invite Egypt as an invitee to discuss its own sovereignty, is a completely arrogant and disrespectful act towards Egypt's national dignity. It is only natural that the Egyptian government refused to participate in the London conference. Any decision made by the London conference without Egypt's participation is, of course, not binding on Egypt in the slightest.
    In addition to using various economic pressures, Britain, France, and the United States are now attempting to use military threats to force Egypt to submit, so that they can arbitrarily infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty. They are not only deploying troops and dispatching a large number of armed forces to intimidate Egypt, but also deliberately sowing discord between Egypt and other Arab countries and between the Egyptian people and the Egyptian government leaders, believing that this will achieve their goals. However, as Prime Minister Nehru said in his statement, this approach by Britain, France, and the United States is wrong. He pointed out that this method is not the method of this era. It does not take into account the situation of today's world and today's Asia. Prime Minister Nehru is absolutely right. Today, all justice-minded people around the world stand on Egypt's side, expressing the greatest sympathy and support for the Egyptian people's just struggle to safeguard their sovereignty. This practice of using military threats by Western countries can only arouse the indignation of the Egyptian people and the people of the world, and cannot achieve any other result.
    Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his statement that India's participation in the London conference does not mean that it is limited and bound by the attitudes and principles stated in the joint communique of Britain, France, and the United States. Its participation in the London conference will not harm Egypt's interests, nor will it harm Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. What the Indian government is concerned about is resolving this issue through agreements among all parties concerned on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. We believe that India, as a major Asian power that understands the thoughts and sentiments of the Asian and African peoples, will contribute to the cause of maintaining world peace by adopting such a solemn stance.

### 印度在苏彝士运河问题上的严正立场

    印度在苏彝士运河问题上的严正立场
    印度尼赫鲁总理在八日就苏彝士运河问题发表声明，支持埃及收回苏彝士运河的行动，并且阐明了印度参加英、法、美建议举行的伦敦会议的立场。尼赫鲁总理这个义正词严的声明，无疑将受到一切关心苏彝士运河问题的和平解决的人们的重视和欢迎。
    尼赫鲁总理在声明中指出，苏彝士运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分，因此，埃及的主权是毫无疑问的。他还指出，埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化，是属于埃及政府职权范围以内的事。尼赫鲁总理说，印度政府认识到，埃及不能也不会参加伦敦会议，因为在这个会议中它只是一个被邀请者，而且关于召开这个会议的问题并没有同它商量。他指出，这次会议不能达成最后的决定，因为那需要埃及的同意。
    尼赫鲁总理这些充分尊重埃及的主权和尊严的意见是完全正确的。英、法、美三国建议召开的伦敦会议，其目的是要讨论苏彝士运河的所谓“国际管制”的问题。可是苏彝士运河是埃及领土的一部分，对运河的管理是埃及的主权。因此，伦敦会议所企图讨论的实质上是埃及的主权问题，而任何一个国家的主权都是不容许有别人讨论的余地的。英、法、美三国想要讨论埃及的主权问题，而且把埃及作为一个被邀请国，邀请它来讨论它本身的主权问题，这完全是蔑视埃及国家尊严和狂妄自大的行为。埃及政府如果拒绝参加伦敦会议，那是理所当然的事情。伦敦会议在没有埃及参加的情况下作出的任何决定，当然对埃及是没有丝毫约束力的。
    英、法、美三国现在除了使用各种经济压力以外，正企图用武力威胁来迫使埃及屈服，好让它们任意侵犯埃及的主权。它们不但调兵遣将，调派了大批武装力量来对埃及进行恫吓，而且故意在埃及和其他阿拉伯国家之间以及埃及人民和埃及政府领袖之间进行挑拨离间，以为这样就可以达到它们的目的。但是，正如尼赫鲁总理在声明里所说的，英、法、美三国这种做法是错误的。他指出，这种方法不是这个时代的方法。它没有考虑到今日世界的情况和今日亚洲的情况。尼赫鲁总理的话是完全对的。今天全世界具有正义感的人都站在埃及这一边，对埃及人民维护主权的正义斗争，表示最大的同情和声援。西方国家这种使用武力威胁的做法，除了激起埃及人民和全世界人民的义愤而外，不可能得到任何其他的结果。
    尼赫鲁总理在声明中指出，印度参加伦敦会议，决不意味着它受到英、法、美联合公报所陈述的态度和原则的限制和约束。它参加伦敦会议不会损害埃及的利益，也不会损害埃及的主权和尊严。印度政府所关切的是在尊重埃及的主权和尊严的基础上通过一切有关方面的协议来解决这个问题。我们相信，作为一个了解亚非人民的思想和情绪的亚洲大国的印度，采取这样一个严正立场，是有助于维护世界和平的事业的。
