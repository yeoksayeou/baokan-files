Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 12th: Indonesian President Sukarno said in Jakarta on August 10th that the current task of the Indonesian people is to recover West Irian, eliminate the remaining colonialist forces from Indonesian territory, and fully realize their ideals.

Sukarno pointed out at the opening session of the National Committee of the All-Indonesia People's Representative Assembly that colonialism has aroused worldwide excitement over the nationalization of the Suez Canal. He said, "We must do everything in our power to eradicate colonialism."

The All-Indonesia People's Representative Assembly was held from August 10th to 16th last year at the suggestion of President Sukarno. Sukarno once said that the task of this assembly is to unite and organize the broad public to complete the Indonesian national revolution. The National Committee of the Assembly consists of seventy-four people.

President Sukarno reiterated his view: The Indonesian revolution cannot be completed by a single party—whether it is the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, or any other party. He pointed out that in order to complete the revolution, the strength of the masses must be organized, which is why he requested the holding of the People's Representative Assembly at the Indonesian Nationalist Party Congress in the past.

Sukarno believes that the All-Indonesia People's Representative Assembly should not be sectarian. It should be composed of all patriotic people who have fought for Indonesia's national independence against imperialism and colonialism, whether they belong to the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Masyumi Party, the Nahdlatul Ulama, or any other party. He hopes that the All-Indonesia People's Representative Assembly will become the agitator, leader, and organizer of the people's movement.

Chairman of the All-Indonesia People's Representative Assembly, Arudji Kartawinata, expressed in his opening speech his hope that the government will faithfully implement its program supported by all the Indonesian people. He emphasized the importance of uniting people from all walks of life in the anti-colonialist struggle, and said that the government's program can only be realized through the joint efforts of the people and the government. He said that the main issue to be discussed at this meeting is how to urge the government to implement its program.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo spoke on behalf of the government. He expressed his determination to implement his government's program. He said that after five months of implementation, he began to realize that implementing the program was an arduous task. However, his confidence has been strengthened because his government's program is supported not only by the parliament but also by the masses.

Many senior government officials, members of parliament, and Jakarta Mayor Sudiro attended the opening session of the National Committee. A large group of young people held placards at the meeting place with slogans calling for national unity and the complete realization of the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements.

    在印度尼西亚人民代表大会全国委员会开幕会议上
    苏加诺号召收复西伊里安消灭殖民主义残余
    新华社雅加达12日讯　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺八月十日在雅加达说，印度尼西亚人民目前的任务是收复西伊里安，从印度尼西亚领土上消灭残余的殖民主义势力和充分实现他们的理想。
    苏加诺在全印度尼西亚人民代表大会全国委员会开幕会议上指出，在苏彝士运河国有化问题上，殖民主义已经引起了全世界的激动情绪。他说，“我们必须尽全力来铲除殖民主义”。
    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会是在苏加诺总统建议下在去年八月十日至十六日举行的。苏加诺曾经说，这个大会的任务是团结和组织广大公众来完成印度尼西亚的民族革命。大会的全国委员会由七十四人组成。
    苏加诺总统重申了他的见解：印度尼西亚的革命是不可能由一个单独的党派——不论是印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党，还是别的党派——来完成的。他指出，为了完成革命，必须组织群众的力量，这就是为什么他过去在印度尼西亚国民党代表大会上要求举行人民代表大会的原因。
    苏加诺认为，全印度尼西亚人民代表大会不应该有宗派主义。它应该由所有为印度尼西亚的民族独立而奋斗的反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的爱国人士组成，不论他属于印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党、马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会，还是其他任何党派。他希望全印度尼西亚人民代表大会会成为人民运动的鼓动者、领导者和组织者。
    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会主席阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔在他的开幕词中表示希望政府将忠实地执行它的为全体印度尼西亚人民所支持的纲领。他强调了在反殖民主义斗争中把各阶层人民团结起来的重要性，并且说，政府的纲领只有由人民和政府的共同努力才能实现。他说，这次会议将要讨论的主要问题是如何督促政府实现它的纲领。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理代表政府发言。他表示他决心实现他的政府的纲领。他说，经过五个月的实施，他开始了解到，执行纲领是个艰巨的任务。然而，由于他的政府的纲领不仅受到议会的支持而且还受到人民群众的支持，他的信心加强了。
    参加全国委员会开幕会议的有许多政府高级官员、国会议员们和雅加达市长苏迪罗。大群的青年人在会议地点拿着标语牌，上面写着要求民族团结和完全实现废除圆桌会议协定的口号。
