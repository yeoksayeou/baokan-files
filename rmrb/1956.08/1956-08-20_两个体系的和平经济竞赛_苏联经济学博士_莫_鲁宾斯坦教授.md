    Peaceful Economic Competition Between Two Systems
    Professor Mo. Rubinstein, Doctor of Economics
    The transformation of socialism into a world system is the greatest event of world historical significance. The people of thirteen countries, accounting for more than one-third of humanity, are successfully developing their economies according to socialist principles. They are clearly demonstrating to the world the speed of economic development, especially the speed of industrialization, which was never seen in the capitalist era, not even in its heyday.
    In the post-war years, the economic foundation of socialism has been greatly strengthened on an international scale due to the rapid economic growth of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Economic cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp has become closer and more comprehensive. This cooperation is built on the basis of mutual consultation and coordination of economic plans, the utmost expansion of trade and other economic ties, and selfless brotherly cooperation and mutual assistance. This signifies the formation and development of new-type socialist international relations.
    Now, in addition to the capitalist state system, there is a socialist state system linked by lasting friendship, a unified desire and will to defend world peace. The question of the possibility of isolating the Soviet Union is forever closed. In contrast to the unequal relations within the capitalist camp, which are based on domination and subservience, and fierce competition, truly equal, friendly, and fraternal economic and political relations have developed and strengthened within the socialist camp. Consistently adhering to Lenin's principles in international relations has yielded and will continue to yield excellent results.
    In recent years, the emergence of new sovereign states that have liberated themselves from colonial rule and declared that they neither belong to any camp nor participate in any bloc is an important factor in international relations. The future will prove the path of social development these countries take, which will depend on the balance of class forces within these countries. Our duty is to extend a sincere hand of friendship to these countries, selflessly assist their economic construction, and support the genuine economic independence they have already achieved.
    The principle of peaceful coexistence between different social and political systems is the foundation of our entire foreign policy. Proceeding from the prospect of the simultaneous existence of capitalist and socialist countries for a long historical period, V.I. Lenin resolutely rejected any idea of "inciting" revolutions in other countries or exporting revolutions, which contradicts Marxism. He pointed out that developing economic ties between the Soviet state and capitalist countries for the benefit of both parties is not only possible but absolutely necessary. Lenin's starting point was to establish the principle of equality between the two actually existing systems of ownership—socialist ownership and capitalist ownership—on the international stage, and the necessity of peaceful competition between these two systems of ownership.
    Peaceful coexistence is not a temporary political slogan, but the general line of the foreign policy of socialist countries.
    In the current era of technological revolution, that is, in the atomic age, the issue of peaceful coexistence has become a crucial issue for all countries and peoples.
    The Soviet socialist state was born in October 1917 with the slogan of "peace." Peace has been, is, and will always be the constant and unchanging goal of our foreign policy.
    We say to capitalist countries: End the Cold War and the arms race, and let us use the majority of the funds spent on manufacturing destructive weapons to improve the material welfare of our people! Let us turn the arms race into a peaceful economic competition to develop social productive forces and improve the living standards of our residents!
    Some capitalist politicians say that peaceful coexistence and peaceful economic competition are the same as the "Cold War." These people say that the Communists do not abandon their ultimate goal—the victory of socialism on a world scale—they simply want to buy time until the balance of economic and military power becomes more favorable to them.
    These arguments by defenders of the "Cold War" indicate a lack of confidence in the strength of capitalism, that is, in their own strength. We regard peaceful coexistence as the opposite of the "Cold War." We not only hope to live together without suffering attacks, but also hope to achieve economic and cultural cooperation between countries with different social systems. We hope that people will no longer consider military conflict between the two systems as inevitable. Our peace policy has never been determined by, and is now even less determined by, our weakness or a desire to buy time. The socialist system has everything necessary to gloriously defend its existence. Our confidence in the final victory of socialism over capitalism in the world-wide peaceful competition is based on the most advanced and only correct Marxist-Leninist science regarding the laws of social development. This science concludes that in the future the new socialist society will inevitably replace the antiquated capitalist society. These conclusions state that the transition from capitalism to socialism in a certain country is not due to some external interference or the export of revolution, but due to the development of social forces within each country.
    Under peaceful conditions, socialism demonstrates far greater superiority than capitalism. Our deep, scientifically based, and historically confirmed conviction that the socialist system will prevail over the capitalist system under any conditions of peaceful competition is based on this.
    In the post-war period, the balance of power between the two systems has further changed in favor of socialism and to the detriment of capitalism.
    In terms of the growth rate of industrial output, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have greatly surpassed capitalist countries.
    During the period from 1929 to 1955, that is, in twenty-six years, the Soviet Union's industrial output increased more than nineteen times. In the same period, the United States increased by a little more than double, and the entire capitalist world increased by only a little more than three-quarters. In the post-war years (1946-1954), the Soviet Union's industrial production almost tripled, while the entire capitalist world increased by three-quarters, and the United States increased by one-third.
    The average annual growth rate of industrial production from 1929 to 1954 was 12.2% in the Soviet Union, 3% in the United States, and 2.3% in the entire capitalist world. Therefore, in the last twenty-five years, the industrial growth rate of the Soviet Union exceeded that of the United States by more than three times, and that of the entire capitalist world by more than four times.
    The growth rate of industrial production in the People's Democratic countries has also greatly surpassed that of capitalist countries. For example, the total index of industrial production in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania in 1954 was more than three times the level of 1937, while the total index of six European capitalist countries, France, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Austria, and Greece, increased by less than 0.4 times in the same period.
    As a result of the faster industrial development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries compared to capitalist countries, the proportion of the entire socialist countries in world industrial output has greatly increased. The development of China's industrialization in recent years has opened up new and magnificent prospects in this regard.
    The Soviet state has consistently and resolutely defended the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems, and strives to expand trade with other countries on the basis of mutual benefit. The expansion of foreign trade on the basis of mutual benefit, especially the export of modern industrial equipment (including complete sets of equipment for large industrial enterprises) from the Soviet Union, is of great significance for the economic development of underdeveloped countries. This makes it possible for underdeveloped countries to free themselves from the dependence on monopoly capital formed by imperialist countries in the supply of equipment and technical assistance, so that underdeveloped countries can develop their own national economies without being subject to the obstacles created by imperialists to prevent the industrialization of countries that are embarking on the path of national independent development.
    Newspapers in India, Burma, and many other countries have emphasized the fact that the increase in the economic power of the Soviet Union in the Sixth Five-Year Plan will enable the Soviet Union to strengthen technical and economic cooperation with backward countries.
    At the same time, Indian scientists, economists, and social activists emphasized that studying the Soviet Union's experience in economic development is very important for India. Despite the differences in social and political systems and the great differences in specific economic conditions, Indians can gain a lot by studying the path taken by the great socialist country, which has transformed itself from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country in a very short historical period. Therefore, when understanding the experience of the Soviet Five-Year Plan, the people of underdeveloped countries study with particular interest the Soviet Union's experience and achievements in national industrialization and electrification, training skilled cadres, and improving the culture of formerly backward ethnic groups.
    Based on its own experience, the Soviet Union knows the decisive significance of heavy industry for ensuring national independence and building a socialist society, and therefore is very sympathetic to economically backward countries that are striving to develop their national economies, especially developing their own industries.
    As early as before the October Revolution, V.I. Lenin wrote about the tasks after the victory:
    "We shall endeavor to render these nations, more backward and oppressed than we are, disinterested cultural assistance’ (to quote very aptly the Polish Social-Democrats) i.e., to help them pass to the employment of machinery, to the lightening of labor, to democracy, to socialism." ("Lenin Collected Works" Russian edition Volume 23, page 55)
    Forty years have passed since then. The position of backward Tsarist Russia has been replaced by the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country, which has realized national industrialization in a very short historical period and has become a powerful industrial country.
    Now, for the Eastern countries that have been liberated from colonialism not long ago, the Soviet Union can and has begun to actually provide not only selfless cultural assistance, but also actively help these countries industrialize by supplying equipment, designing and building new enterprises, providing scientific and technical experience (including experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy), economic planning, training skilled cadres, and so on.
    The Soviet Union has signed an agreement with India on helping India build a huge metallurgical plant, and the Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to contribute its experience in building other industrial enterprises, power stations, hydraulic buildings, the peaceful use of atomic energy, and other scientific and technological achievements.
    In the joint statement of N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the desire of the two countries to develop economic cooperation and expand trade relations was emphasized. The first step in this regard is the following agreement reached: over the three years beginning in 1956, the Soviet Union will supply India with one million tons of steel; sell equipment for oil extraction, mining industrial equipment, and other equipment, as well as other commodities. The Soviet Union will greatly increase the quantity of Indian raw materials and industrial products purchased.
    The Soviet Union is also vigorously helping the development of industry and agriculture in Burma, Afghanistan, and other countries.
    The significance of the development of China's industrialization for the development of economically underdeveloped Eastern countries can be clearly seen from the agreement on economic assistance between the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia signed in Beijing in June 1956.
    The historical significance of these initial steps by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to help underdeveloped countries industrialize in a planned way is inestimable.
    The Soviet Union believes that competition in this regard is undoubtedly much better than the arms race. This competition clearly demonstrates the great superiority of the socialist planned economy, which is developing to more and more fully meet the material and cultural needs of the masses of the people.

    两个体系的和平经济竞赛
    苏联经济学博士　莫·鲁宾斯坦教授
    社会主义变成了一个世界体系，这是具有世界历史意义的最伟大的事件。占全人类三分之一以上的十三个国家的人民根据社会主义的原则顺利地发展着自己的经济。他们明显地向全世界显示出在资本主义时期，甚至是在它蓬勃发展时期都未曾有过的经济发展的速度，特别是工业化的速度。
    在战后年代中，由于苏联和各人民民主国家经济的迅速增长，在国际规模上大大地加强了社会主义的经济基础。社会主义阵营各国之间的经济合作更加密切，更加全面了。这种合作是建筑在经济计划的互相协商和协调、贸易联系和其他经济联系的尽力扩大以及无私的兄弟般合作互助的基础上的。这就意味着新型的社会主义的国际关系的形成和发展。
    现在，除了资本主义国家体系以外，已经有了用持久的友谊、对保卫世界和平的一致愿望和意志联结起来的社会主义国家体系。关于孤立苏联的可能性的问题是永远地结束了。同建立在统治和服从、残酷的竞争基础上的资本主义阵营内部的不平等关系相反，真正平等、友好和兄弟般的经济和政治关系，已在社会主义阵营内部发展和加强起来。在国际关系中一贯地遵循着列宁的原则已经得到并且还要得到它的极好的结果。
    在最近几年中，一些从殖民统治下解放出来、宣布既不归附任何阵营也不参加任何集团的新的主权国家的出现，是国际关系的重要因素。未来会证明这些国家的社会发展道路如何，这将决定于这些国家内部阶级力量的对比。我们的职责是向这些国家伸出真挚的友好的手，无私地援助它们的经济建设和支持它们已经取得的真正的经济独立。
    不同的社会制度和政治制度和平共处的原则是我们全部外交政策的基础。弗·伊·列宁从资本主义国家和社会主义国家在一个长的历史时期同时存在的前景出发，坚决地摒弃了同马克思主义相抵触的任何“鼓动”其他国家的革命和任何的输出革命的思想。他指出在苏维埃国家和资本主义国家之间，为了双方的利益而发展经济联系不仅是可能的，而且是绝对必要的。列宁的出发点是确立两个实际上存在的所有制——社会主义所有制和资本主义所有制——的体系在国际舞台上平等的原则和在这两个体系——所有制之间的和平竞赛的原则的必要性。
    和平共处不是一种暂时的政治口号，而是社会主义国家外交政策的总路线。
    在现在的技术革命时代，即在原子时代，和平共处问题已成为一切国家和人民的关键问题。
    苏维埃社会主义国家是在1917年10月伴随着“和平”的口号诞生的。和平，过去、现在和将来都是我们外交政策的经常和不变的目标。
    我们向资本主义国家说，结束冷战和军备竞赛，我们把花费在制造毁灭性武器的那些资金的大部分用来提高人民的物质福利吧！让我们把军备竞赛改为发展社会生产力和提高居民生活水平的和平经济竞赛吧！
    某些资本主义政治家说，和平共处和和平经济竞赛同“冷战”的意义是一样的。这些人说，共产党人并不放弃自己的最终目的——社会主义在世界范围内的胜利，他们只是想赢得时间，直到经济和军事力量的对比变得对他们更加有利的时候。
    “冷战”辩护者的这些议论表示对资本主义力量，即对他们自己本身力量缺乏信心。我们把和平共处看作是同“冷战”相对立的。我们不仅希望共同生活，不遭受攻击，而且也希望在不同社会制度国家之间达到经济和文化的合作。我们希望人们不再认为两个体系之间的军事冲突是不可避免的。我们的和平政策从来也没有决定于，而现在更不是决定于我们的软弱或是希望赢得时间。社会主义体系有一切必要的东西以光荣地保卫自己的生存。我们对社会主义在世界范围内同资本主义和平竞赛的最后胜利的信心是建立在最先进和唯一正确的马克思列宁主义科学关于社会发展规律的根据上的。这一科学的结论谈到在将来新的社会主义社会代替陈腐的资本主义社会的必然性。这些结论说到，在某一国家从资本主义向社会主义过渡的产生不是由于某种外来的干涉和革命的输出，而是由于每一个国家内部社会力量的发展。
    在和平的条件下，社会主义表明了比资本主义极大的优越性。我们在和平竞赛的任何条件下社会主义体系都将占资本主义体系的上风的深刻、有科学根据、为历史经验所确证的信念，就建立在这个基础上。
    在战后时期，两个体系的力量对比进一步发生了有利于社会主义而不利于资本主义的变化。
    按工业产量的增长速度来说，苏联和其他社会主义国家大大地超过了资本主义国家。
    在1929—1955年期间，也就是在二十六年期间，苏联的工业产量增加了十九倍以上，在同一个时期，美国增加了一倍多一点，整个资本主义世界只增加了四分之三以上。在战后年间（1946—1954年）苏联的工业生产差不多增加了三倍，整个资本主义世界增加了四分之三，美国增加了三分之一。
    1929—1954年的工业生产每年平均增长速度苏联是12.2％，美国是3％，整个资本主义世界是2.3％。因此，在最近二十五年期间苏联的工业增长速度超过美国三倍多，超过整个资本主义世界四倍多。
    人民民主国家工业生产的增长速度也大大地超过了资本主义国家。例如，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚1954年工业生产的总指数为1937年水平的三倍多，而法国、比利时、丹麦、卢森堡、奥地利和希腊六个欧洲资本主义国家在同一个时期的总指数提高的却不到零点四倍。
    由于苏联和其他社会主义国家的工业发展速度比资本主义国家更快的结果，整个社会主义国家在世界工业产量中的比重大大地增加了。最近几年中国工业化的发展在这方面开辟了新的宏伟的前景。
    苏维埃国家一贯坚决捍卫不同社会制度和政治制度的国家和平共处的可能性和必要性，竭力在遵守互利的基础上扩大同其他国家的贸易。在互利基础上的对外贸易的扩大，特别是从苏联输出现代化的工业设备（其中包括大工业企业的全套设备）年年在增加，对不发达国家的经济发展具有非常重大的意义。这使不发达的国家有可能由帝国主义国家在供应设备和技术援助方面所形成的对垄断资本的依附中解放出来，从而使不发达的国家能够发展自己的民族经济，而不受帝国主义者为了阻止走上民族独立发展道路的国家的工业化所制造的障碍。
    印度、缅甸和其他许多国家的报纸强调指出了这一事实：苏联在第六个五年计划中经济威力的增加将使苏联能加强同落后国家的技术和经济合作。
    同时，印度的科学家、经济学家和社会活动家强调指出，研究苏联在经济发展方面的经验对于印度是非常重要的。尽管社会制度和政治制度不同，具体经济条件也区别很大，但是研究在极短的历史时期内从落后的农业国家变成强大的工业国家的伟大社会主义国家经济发展所走的道路，印度人是能够得到很多收获的。因此，不发达国家的各国人民在了解苏联五年计划的经验时，以特别的兴趣研究苏联在国家工业化和电气化、培养熟练干部、提高从前落后民族的文化等方面的经验和成就。
    苏联根据自己的经验知道，重工业对保证国家独立和社会主义社会建设的决定性意义，因而对努力发展民族经济，特别是发展本国工业的经济上落后的国家是非常同情的。
    早在十月革命以前，弗·伊·列宁就写到关于胜利以后的任务：
     “我们要竭尽全力同蒙古人、波斯人、印度人、埃及人接近和融洽起来。我们认为这样做是自己的职责，并符合自己的利益，因为要不这样，社会主义在欧洲将不能巩固。我们竭力对这些比我们更落后和更受压迫的各国人民给以像波兰社会民主党人所漂亮地称做的‘无私的文化援助’，也就是帮助他们过渡到使用机器，减轻劳动，过渡到民主和社会主义。”（“列宁全集”俄文版第二十三卷第五十五页）
    从那个时候起已经过去了四十年。落后的沙皇俄国的地位已经被在极短的历史时期内实现了国家工业化并成为强大的工业国家的苏联——世界上第一个社会主义国家所代替了。
    现在，对于不久以前从殖民制度下解放出来的东方国家，苏联能够而且已开始实际上不仅给以无私的文化援助，而且用供售设备、设计和建设新企业的方法，用提供科学技术经验（其中包括和平利用原子能方面的经验）、经济计划、训练熟练干部等等的经验的方法来积极帮助这些国家工业化。
    苏联同印度签订了关于帮助印度建设一个巨大的冶金工厂的协定，苏联并且表示准备贡献自己在建设其他工业企业、电站、水力建筑、和平利用原子能和其他科学技术成就的经验。
    在苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁的联合声明中，曾强调指出两国发展经济合作和扩大贸易关系的愿望。这方面的第一个步骤，是达成的下列协议：从1956年开始的三年内，苏联向印度供售一百万吨钢材；售卖开采石油的设备、采矿工业设备和其他设备，以及其他商品。在苏联方面将大大增加购买印度的原料和工业品的数量。
    苏联也大力帮助缅甸、阿富汗和其他国家的工业和农业的发展。
    中国工业化的发展对在经济上不发达的东方国家的发展方面将具有怎样的意义，从1956年6月在北京签订的中华人民共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府关于经济援助的协定中可以明显的看出来。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家有计划地帮助不发达国家工业化方面的这些最初步骤的历史意义，是难以估计的。
    苏联认为，在这方面的竞赛无疑地比军备竞赛要好得多。这种竞赛明显地证明为越来越充分地满足人民群众的物质和文化需要而发展着的社会主义计划经济的极大优越性。　（本报特约稿）
