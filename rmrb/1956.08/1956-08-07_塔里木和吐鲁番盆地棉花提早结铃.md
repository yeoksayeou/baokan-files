Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 6th – More than 1.7 million mu of cotton in the Tarim and Turpan Basins of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have generally formed bolls about ten days earlier than in previous years. In Turpan County, the cotton bolls have begun to split and burst, and new cotton will soon be picked. In Bachu, Aksu, Kuqa, Xinhe and other counties, the largest cotton producing areas in Xinjiang, cotton plants have grown to more than 90 centimeters in height, extending fourteen or fifteen fruit branches, and the early fruit branches have already grown plump and hard cotton bolls. At present, various places are strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields. From the beginning of August, farmers have been promptly topping the cotton plants and pruning empty branches in the dense cotton rows. In places where cotton plants are too dense, thin seedlings are also being thinned to improve ventilation and light penetration, and prevent boll shedding.

This year, farmers in various places have universally learned from the cotton planting experience of the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and improved farming techniques and cotton field management. During the sowing period, farmers of all ethnic groups changed the past extensive method of broadcast sowing, and all cotton fields were strip planted. Hetian, Moyu and other counties also implemented wide and narrow row close planting. The cotton plants in strip-planted cotton fields are uniform, generally maintaining six to seven thousand plants per mu. In order to promote the early growth of cotton seedlings, various places have generally advanced the dates for seedling setting, weeding and watering. The seedling setting and first watering of 100,000 mu of cotton fields in Turpan were carried out about twenty days earlier than last year.

    塔里木和吐鲁番盆地棉花提早结铃
    新华社乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆维吾尔自治区塔里木盆地和吐鲁番盆地一百七十多万亩棉花普遍比往年提早十天左右结铃。吐鲁番县的棉桃开始裂绽，不久即可摘新棉。在新疆最大产棉区巴楚和阿克苏、库车、新和等县，棉株已长到九十多公分高，伸出十四五个果枝，早期果枝已经挂上肥硬的棉桃。目前各地正加强棉田后期管理。从八月初，农民们在茂密的棉行里及时给棉株打尖顶，剪空枝。棉株过密的地方也在间拔瘦苗，以便通风透光，防止落铃。
    今年各地农民普遍学习了中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队的植棉经验，改进了耕作技术和棉田管理。在播种期间，各族农民改变了过去撒播的粗放方法，全部棉田都进行了条播。和阗、墨玉等县还实行了宽窄行密植。条播的棉田棉株均匀，一般每亩保持六七千株。为了促进棉苗的早期生长，各地普遍提早了定苗、除草和浇水。吐鲁番十万亩棉田的定苗和第一遍浇水比去年提早了二十天左右。
