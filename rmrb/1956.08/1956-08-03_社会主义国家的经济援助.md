    Economic Aid from Socialist Countries
    Sheng Lailai

    U.S. Vice President Nixon, during his recent "trip" to the Far East, openly slandered the economic aid provided by socialist countries. He said that any Asian country that accepts "Communist aid risks putting a noose around its neck." Nixon's rhetoric only demonstrates that the active economic cooperation between the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries with Asian and African nations has caused panic in the United States.

    Today, there exists a powerful socialist country system. These countries are willing and capable of helping backward countries develop their economies. This prevents imperialist countries from freely using the guise of economic "aid" to seize political and military privileges. This is the main reason why Nixon curses "Communist aid."

    But Nixon's curses are useless. Let's look at the facts!

    On April 3rd of this year, the Soviet Union and India signed an agreement regarding the Soviet Union's assistance in constructing a steel plant in India with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel, through long-term loans. The agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union would provide equipment worth approximately 550 million rubles within three years at a low interest rate of 2.5%. The installation of this equipment would be carried out under the guidance of Soviet experts. Indian experts could visit Soviet factories to observe the manufacturing and production of the equipment. The agreement also stipulated that equipment that India could produce would be manufactured by India itself. In addition, the Soviet Union also donated various agricultural machines to India, enough to equip what is currently India's largest farm. The Soviet Union also gratuitously helped India establish a high-level industrial technical school that can train and educate 1,000 technical cadres annually. These Soviet aid efforts are unconditional and beneficial to the development of India's national economy, and therefore welcomed by the Indian people.

    The economic relationship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan is another example. In addition to general trade relations between the two countries, the Soviet Union also provides Afghanistan with economic aid. Afghanistan has already constructed cotton ginning mills, oil depots, granaries, flour mills, and bakeries with Soviet assistance. The Soviet Union has also sent many experts to Afghanistan to help with construction. At the end of last year, during the visit of Bulganin, Khrushchev, and others to Afghanistan, the Soviet Union agreed to provide technical assistance to Afghanistan in the construction of hydropower stations and water conservancy projects, and to grant Afghanistan a loan of 100 million US dollars.

    The Soviet Union's economic relations with Burma have also developed in recent years, and the Soviet Union has also helped Burma solve its difficulties in rice sales. Due to the dumping of surplus agricultural products by the United States in Asia, Burma's rice exports, which account for a large proportion of its fiscal revenue, have been greatly affected, resulting in significant economic difficulties for Burma. In the three-year trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Burma in 1955, it was stipulated that the Soviet Union would purchase 150,000-200,000 tons of Burmese rice annually. Recently, it has agreed to purchase 400,000 tons of Burmese rice annually. The Soviet Union's measures to purchase Burmese rice have been warmly welcomed by Burmese public opinion. After Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Burma last year, the Soviet Union provided even more economic and technical assistance, preparing to help Burma formulate plans for industrial and agricultural development and build basic water conservancy projects. At the same time, it also gratuitously donated a vocational college to Burma to train technical personnel for them.

    The Soviet Union has also extended a helping hand to countries such as Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, helping them build their own countries.

    In addition to the Soviet Union, the Eastern European people's democratic countries also help Asian and African countries with construction through trade and the supply of technical personnel. For example, Czechoslovakia is helping India build a cement plant with a daily output of 200 tons, providing complete sets of machinery and equipment and training technical personnel. Romania, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland provide India and other countries with various technical assistance in industries such as oil exploration, film production, and dock construction.

    The aid agreement signed between China and Cambodia on June 21st of this year is another clear example. The agreement stipulates that in the two years of 1956 and 1957, China will gratuitously donate commodities and materials worth 8 million pounds sterling to Cambodia. The Cambodian government will use these aid materials to build construction projects urgently needed by Cambodia. The Chinese government will send experts and technicians to Cambodia to work under the direction of the Cambodian government. The agreement specifically stipulates that after the Chinese aid materials are transported to Cambodia, Cambodia can use them freely, and China will not interfere in any way.

    From these practical examples, it can be clearly seen that the economic relations between socialist countries and Asian and African countries are based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Sino-Cambodian economic aid agreement clearly stipulates the Five Principles as the basis for economic cooperation. Socialist countries' aid to Asian and African countries is to help them establish independent economies and improve the people's lives. Therefore, these aid efforts are not attached with any political conditions and are established entirely on a voluntary basis between the two sides.

    Conversely, the United States uses "U.S. Aid" to infringe on the sovereignty and interests of recipient countries. For example, in October 1952, the U.S. Congress passed the notorious "Battle Act," which stipulated that countries receiving military and economic assistance from the United States must prohibit the export of "strategic materials" to socialist countries. In 1953, Ceylon sold rubber to China because it could not find a market for its rubber, and as a result, the United States stopped providing "aid" to Ceylon for several years. However, Ceylon did not yield. Recently, the United States, under pressure of circumstances, had to backtrack and claim that the "Battle Act" could not apply to Ceylon, and granted it 5 million US dollars in "aid." But, in fact, the United States interferes everywhere in those countries that receive "aid." When Thailand trades with China, the U.S. Embassy also raises questions. When Japanese business people interact with China, the United States also protests. This overbearing behavior has already aroused resentment among all Asian and African people. This shows who is trying to put a noose around the necks of Asian and African countries.

    Now, more and more countries are willing to accept aid from socialist countries, and this trend cannot be stopped by any abuse or intimidation from the United States. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference in Hamburg on July 16th: "Asian and African countries have no reason not to accept economic aid from the Soviet Union." Cambodian Prime Minister Khim Tit also said after the signing of the Sino-Cambodian economic aid agreement: "These aid efforts are completely unconditional. China's aid to Cambodia comes from goodwill and friendship." These words are a powerful response from Asian countries to Nixon!

### 社会主义国家的经济援助

    社会主义国家的经济援助
    盛莉来
    美国副总统尼克松不久以前到远东“旅行”时，曾经公开诬蔑社会主义国家的经济援助。他说，接受“共产党援助的任何亚洲国家冒有把绳子套在它的脖子上的危险。”尼克松这种论调只是说明苏联、中国和其它人民民主国家积极展开同亚非国家的经济合作已引起美国的恐慌。
    现在世界上存在着一个强大的社会主义国家体系。这些国家愿意而且有力量帮助落后国家来发展他们的经济。这样，帝国主义国家就不能随心所欲地拿经济“援助”的幌子来攫取政治上和军事上的特权。这就是尼克松咒骂“共产党援助”的主要原因。
    但是尼克松这种咒骂是没有用的。让我们看看事实吧！
    今年四月三日，苏联和印度签订了一项关于苏联以长期贷款的方式帮助印度建设一座年产一百三十万吨钢的炼钢厂的供应协定。协定规定苏联将在三年内以低利2.5％贷款的方式供给印度总值约5.5亿卢比的设备，这些设备的安装将在苏联专家的指导下进行。印度专家可以到苏联工厂参观设备的制造和生产情况。协定并规定印度能够生产的设备将由印度自己制造。此外，苏联还赠送给印度各种农业机械，可以装备一个目前印度最大的农场。苏联还无偿地帮助印度建立每年可培养和训练一千个技术干部的高级工业技术学校。苏联这些援助不附带任何条件，它对印度民族经济的发展是有利的，因此受到印度人民的欢迎。
    苏联和阿富汗的经济关系也是一个例证。他们两国之间除了一般的贸易关系外，苏联同样地给予阿富汗经济援助。阿富汗已在苏联帮助下建设了轧棉厂、石油库、谷仓、面粉厂和面包厂等。苏联还派了很多专家去阿富汗帮助建设。去年年底，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫等访问阿富汗时，苏联又同意在建设水电站、兴修水利方面，给予阿富汗以技术援助，并给予阿富汗一亿美元的贷款。
    苏联同缅甸的经济关系近年来也有发展，苏联并帮助缅甸解决大米销售的困难。由于美国到亚洲倾销剩余农产品，在缅甸财政收入中占很大比重的大米出口大大地受到影响，从而使缅甸在经济上遭到很大困难。苏联在1955年和缅甸签订的三年贸易协定中规定每年购买缅甸15—20万吨大米，最近又同意每年购买缅甸大米四十万吨。苏联购买缅甸大米的措施，已引起缅甸舆论界的热烈欢迎。去年布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问缅甸后，苏联又提供了更多的经济和技术援助，准备帮助缅甸拟定工农业发展计划，兴建基本水利工程等，同时还无偿地赠给缅甸一所工艺学院，为它们培养技术人材。
    苏联对于印度尼西亚、埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩等国家也都同样地伸出援助的手，来帮助他们建设自己的国家。
    除了苏联以外，东欧人民民主国家也通过贸易方式和供应技术人员的方式帮助亚非国家进行建设。例如，捷克斯洛伐克帮助印度建设每日可产二百吨的水泥厂，供给全套机器设备并且训练技术人员。罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、波兰在石油钻探、影片制造、码头建筑等工业上给印度及其它国家各种技术援助。
    中国和柬埔寨于今年六月二十一日签订的援助协定又是另外一个显明的例证。协定中规定了在1956、1957年两年内，中国将无偿地赠给柬埔寨价值八百万英镑的商品和物资。柬埔寨政府将利用这些援助物资来建设柬埔寨迫切需要的建设项目。中国政府将派遣专家和技术人员去柬埔寨，在柬埔寨政府的指挥下进行工作。协定中特别规定中国的援助物资运到柬埔寨后，柬埔寨可以自由使用，中国不加以任何干涉。
    从以上这些实际的例子，可以很明显地看出社会主义国家和亚非国家之间的经济关系是建立在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处五项原则的基础上的。中柬经济援助协定中就明确规定了五项原则作为经济合作的基础。社会主义国家对亚非国家的援助是为了帮助他们建立独立的经济，提高人民的生活，因此这些援助不附带有任何政治条件，是完全在双方自愿的基础上建立起来的。
    相反地美国却利用“美援”来侵犯受援国的主权和利益。举例说：1952年10月美国国会就通过了臭名彰著的“巴特尔法”，规定了从美国得到军事和经济援助的国家，都要禁止“战略物资”向社会主义国家出口。锡兰在1953年，因为橡胶找不到出路而把橡胶出售给中国，结果几年来美国一直停止供给锡兰“援助”。但是锡兰没有屈服。最近美国迫于形势，又不得不自圆其说地认为“巴特尔法”可以对锡兰不适用，而给予它五百万美元的“援助”。但是，事实上美国对那些得到“援助”国家还是处处干涉。泰国同中国进行贸易，美国大使馆也要提出质问。日本工商界人士同中国来往，美国也要抗议。这种强横的行为，已经使得所有亚非人民感到愤慨。这就说明谁企图用绳子套在亚非国家的脖子上。
    现在，愿意接受社会主义国家援助的国家越来越多了，这个趋势是美国的任何谩骂和恐吓阻止不了的。印度尼赫鲁总理七月十六日在汉堡一个记者招待会上说：“亚非国家没有理由不接受苏联的经济援助。”柬埔寨首相钦·迪在中柬经济援助协定签订后也说：“这些援助是完全没有附带任何条件的。中国对柬埔寨的援助是出自善意和友谊的。”这些话就是亚洲国家对尼克松的有力回答！
