　　Hefei Dispatch: This year, Wuhu Prefecture in Anhui Province has achieved an unprecedented tea harvest. The total output has increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and the total income of tea farmers in the region is expected to increase by over six million yuan compared to last year. The main production areas of the famous "Keemun Black" and "Tunxi Green" teas have both increased production by more than 30% compared to last year.

　　The tea production in this prefecture has greatly improved since cooperativization. Due to the unified management of tea gardens and the rational allocation of labor, most tea gardens were weeded and fertilized this spring, with chemical fertilizer use increasing by more than five times compared to last year. Some tea gardens that were fertilized this year saw an increase in production of more than 50% compared to last year. Secondly, the implementation of advanced batch picking has also guaranteed increased production. Some tea gardens have increased production by 20%, and the quality of tea has also generally improved. The implementation of summer tea picking and the promotion of tea-making machinery have greatly improved the quantity and quality of tea. Currently, it is the time for intensive management of autumn tea, which tea farmers call "digging gold in July, digging silver in August." Now, tea farmers are actively engaged in cultivation, fertilization, and expanding tea gardens.

    芜湖专区茶叶空前丰收
    茶农总收入比去年增加六百多万元
    本报合肥电　安徽省芜湖专区的茶叶今年得到空前丰收，总产量比去年增加二成多，全区茶农总收入要比去年增加六百多万元。驰名中外的“祁红”、“屯绿”主要产地，都比去年增产三成多。
    这个专区的茶叶生产，在合作化以后，有很大提高。由于茶园统一经营，劳力合理调配，大部分茶园，今春都锄了草，施了肥，化学肥料比去年增加五倍多。有的茶园今年施肥后，比去年增产五成多。其次，实行先进的分批采摘也保证了增产，有的茶园增产二成，茶叶质量也普遍提高。实行采夏茶，推广制茶机器，都使茶叶的产量质量有很大提高。当前正是秋茶加紧管理的时候，茶农把这个时候称做“七挖金、八挖银”，现在，茶农们正积极进行中耕施肥，并扩大茶园。
