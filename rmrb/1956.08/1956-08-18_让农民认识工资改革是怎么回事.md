    Let Farmers Understand What Wage Reform Is All About
    The wage reform work for employees across the country is underway, but the local Party committees have rarely paid attention to publicizing why wage reform is being implemented to the farmers. Many farmers have not understood the policies and the necessity of wage reform, and have developed incorrect views about workers and state organ personnel; the idea that some rural youths are not content with agricultural production has also resurfaced. In Xiyuan Township, Chenggu County, Shaanxi Province, many young men and women recently ran to the township people's committee to ask them to introduce them to factories. In order to enable the majority of farmers to have a correct understanding of wage reform, I suggest that the propaganda departments of local Party committees appropriately conduct publicity and explanation work related to wage reform to the farmers.

    让农民认识工资改革是怎么回事
    全国职工的工资改革工作正在进行，但各地党委却很少注意向农民宣传为什么要实行工资改革。有不少农民没有弄清工资改革的政策和它的必要性，产生了对工人和国家机关工作人员的不正确看法；有些农村青年不安心于农业生产的思想又抬头了。像陕西城固县西元乡，最近又有许多青年男女跑到乡人民委员会要求介绍他们进工厂。为了使广大农民对工资改革有个正确的看法，我建议各地党委宣传部门适当地向农民进行有关工资改革的宣传和解释工作。
