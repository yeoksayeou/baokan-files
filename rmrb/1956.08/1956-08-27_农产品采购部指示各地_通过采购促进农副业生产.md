    Agricultural Products Purchasing Department Directs Localities to Promote Agricultural and Sideline Production Through Procurement

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Agricultural Products Purchasing Department recently issued instructions to agricultural product purchasing departments at all levels in order to promote the development of agricultural and sideline production and increase farmers' income. The instructions require guiding agricultural and sideline production through purchasing operations, correctly implementing price policies, and rapidly and substantially purchasing agricultural and sideline products.

    The instructions stated that the scope of agricultural and sideline production related to the operations of agricultural product purchasing departments is very broad, such as the initial processing and packaging of agricultural products, livestock breeding, hunting, wild tea picking, the collection of cattle and sheep wool, and the organization of rural transportation. As long as farmers are willing, have the production conditions, and the produced products have raw materials and sales channels, the purchasing departments should actively purchase them and guide their development in a planned manner. However, it is also necessary to prevent the potential impact on the completion of national industrial raw material supply and export plans due to poor guidance or improper support. At the same time, avoid excessively high costs and low quality of sideline products, leading to sluggish sales, stockpiling, and losses for the state and farmers.

    The instructions also require purchasing departments to actively study and expand the utilization of agricultural and sideline products in cooperation with relevant units. For example, cotton stalks, after being peeled and washed using indigenous methods, can be used to make agricultural ropes or mixed with hemp to make waterproof bags. Other materials such as ramie fluff, kudzu hemp, and miscellaneous wool can be purchased and utilized to increase farmers' income. In short, agricultural product purchasing departments in all regions must patiently start from all aspects, adapt to local conditions and the times, and promote the production of agricultural and sideline products through purchasing operations.

    农产品采购部指示各地
    通过采购促进农副业生产
    本报讯　农产品采购部为促进农副业生产的发展和增加农民收入，最近向各级农产品采购部门发出指示，要求通过采购业务指导农副业生产，正确贯彻价格政策，把农、副产品迅速、大量地收购进来。
    指示中说，同农产品采购部门经营有关的农副业生产范围很广，如农产品初制加工和整装、饲养牲畜、狩猎、采摘野茶、抓牛羊毛绒，组织农村运输等，只要农民自愿，具有生产条件，所生产的产品有原料、有销路，采购部门就应当积极收购并有计划地指导发展。但也应该防止可能发生的由于指导不好，扶植不当而影响国家工业原料供应与出口计划的完成，同时要避免副业产品成本过高、质量低，以致滞销、积压所造成的国家和农民的损失。
    指示还要求采购部门协同有关单位积极研究和扩大农副业产品的利用。如棉杆皮采用土法剥制沤洗以后，可以制作农用绳索或掺麻制成防水袋，其他如苎麻绒、葛麻、杂毛等都可以收购后加以利用，以增加农民的收入。总之，各地农产品采购部门必须耐心地，从各方面着手，因地、因时制宜，通过采购业务促进农副业的生产。
