Ding Fumin, the director of the Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui Province, was an "outsider" to running a large cooperative eight months ago. However, because he was good at learning from the masses and listening to their opinions, the Xingguang Cooperative, which he now leads with more than 4,700 households, has achieved a 40% increase in summer production. Each member household will increase their income by more than one-fifth.

Ding Fumin was originally the Secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Changlinhe District, Feidong County. He had led the successful establishment of several small elementary cooperatives. In the autumn of last year, during the high tide of cooperativization, farmers in four townships, including Changlin and Shikou, in this district established the largest advanced cooperative in the county—the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative—on the basis of more than a dozen small elementary cooperatives. In order to create experience and strengthen specific leadership of this cooperative, the County Committee decided to send Ding Fumin to work in this cooperative. The members elected him as the director of the cooperative. This task was extremely unfamiliar to Ding Fumin. However, the enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside encouraged him. He thought that as long as he humbly learned from the masses and listened to their opinions, any difficulty could be overcome.

Ding Fumin's greatest characteristic in his work is consulting with the masses on important matters. As soon as he arrived at the cooperative, he and the cooperative cadres and Party members studied the production characteristics of the cooperative. When he discovered that the cooperative had a small amount of land and a large population on the one hand (only 1.1 mu of land per person), but on the other hand, there was a large amount of wasteland that had not been reclaimed, he proposed a plan to reclaim 4,000 mu of wasteland along Chaohu Lake at the Party branch meeting. This plan was immediately enthusiastically supported by all Party members and welcomed by the members. After the decision to reclaim the wasteland, more than 1,000 laborers were dispatched from the entire cooperative. They completed the wasteland reclamation plan in less than twenty days, including reclamation and rush planting. This year alone, these 4,000 mu of land increased the cooperative's wheat production by 200,000 jin.

Ding Fumin is also very good at using typical examples to promote general progress in his work. Every time the cooperative assigns a task, he personally grasps the first production team with a better foundation to take the lead and set an example to promote the entire cooperative.

During the autumn sowing last year, the cooperative planned to expand the wheat sowing area from 7,000 mu to 13,000 mu by using "winter fallow land." However, due to the lack of rain for more than a hundred days, the land was so dry and hard that it could not be plowed, and the autumn sowing plan was difficult to complete. At this time, Ding Fumin arranged for each team to find ways to fight drought and sow wheat, and he also went deep into the first production team to study methods of drought-resistant wheat sowing with the members. He demonstrated to the members how he used a hoe to scrape the ground and sow wheat in drought years when he was farming at home in the past. Everyone felt that this method was not only efficient but also allowed for row sowing, which not only solved the problem of wheat sowing but also solved the problem of intercropping other crops in the next season. Therefore, more than 60 laborers in the entire team immediately started working and quickly sowed more than 100 mu of wheat. Then, Ding Fumin organized the captains of all 80 production teams in the cooperative, as well as Party members, Youth League members, and activists, to visit the first team to promote a high tide of drought-resistant rush planting in the entire cooperative. In less than twenty days, the cooperative completed the plan to expand the autumn sowing area, and the sowing time was half a month earlier than the surrounding agricultural cooperatives. This year, the wheat in this cooperative suffered less rust disease damage than any surrounding cooperative due to earlier sowing.

The third characteristic of Ding Fumin's leadership work is to conduct in-depth inspections and solve problems in a timely manner. In addition to relying on the cadres' "brainstorming meetings" three times a week to discover problems, he also personally goes to different types of production teams to inspect the work with a focus.

During the wheat harvest and threshing this year, Ding Fumin inspected four production teams, including Jianbai, and found that there were still many wheat grains on the threshed wheat straw. Many elderly members sighed to themselves that this was "not like the way people live." Ding Fumin immediately arranged for this team to re-thresh the wheat straw, and as a result, about 15 jin of wheat were threshed out of the wheat straw per mu. After Ding Fumin discovered that this was a common problem, he proposed the opinion of "re-threshing the wheat straw" at the meeting of production team leaders of the entire cooperative. As a result, all the wheat straw on more than 10,000 mu was re-threshed, and a total of more than 200,000 jin of wheat were threshed out.

Ding Fumin is also good at educating cadres to overcome the style of commandism in his work.

Most of the cooperative's cadres and production team leaders were originally township and village cadres. They lacked experience in leading large cooperatives and production teams, and many people were accustomed to relying on administrative orders to do their work. Ding Fumin educated everyone, saying, "The new tasks are forcing us to learn from the masses and change our work style; otherwise, we will lose the trust of the masses and fail the hopes of the Party."

He Shunmao, the deputy director of the cooperative, was in charge of sideline production. However, he did not understand the specific business of flour milling. Last winter, flour milling master You Jinjiang encountered difficulties in his work and could not meet the flour production standards. He Shunmao did not investigate and research but subjectively thought that he had ideological problems and accused him, saying, "If you can't do it, you will be dismissed!" You Jinjiang and the members in charge of flour milling were very dissatisfied when they heard this. After Ding Fumin learned about it, he patted He Shunmao on the shoulder and said, "Come with me!" He led He Shunmao to learn from You Jinjiang how to mill flour. After understanding the basic knowledge of flour milling, he helped You Jinjiang study and solve the difficulties in his work, so that the flour yield reached the standard. At this time, He Shunmao was very moved and said, "Director Ding used facts to educate me to change my work style."

Now, the cooperative's cadres and production team leaders have automatically put forward the slogan of "learning from Director Ding and changing the leadership style."

    有事和群众商量
    新华社记者　林牧
    安徽省肥东县星光农业生产合作社主任丁福民，八个月前对办好大型的合作社还是个“门外汉”，但是由于他善于向群众学习，善于倾听群众意见，现在他领导的四千七百多户的星光社已取得了夏季增产四成的胜利，每户社员都将增加五分之一以上的收入。
    丁福民原来是肥东县长临河区的中共区委书记。曾领导办好了几个小型的初级社。去年秋天在合作化高潮中，这个区的长临、施口等四个乡的农民，在十几个小型初级社的基础上办起了一个全县最大的高级社——星光农业社；县委为了创造经验、加强对这个社的具体领导，就决定派丁福民到这个社来工作，社员们选他当了社主任。这个任务对丁福民来说是极其陌生的。但是，建设社会主义新农村的热情鼓舞着他，他想，只要自己虚心向群众学习，倾听群众意见，任何困难都会克服。
    丁福民在工作中最大的特点是有事和群众商量。他一到合作社就和社干、党员研究这个社生产上的特点。当他发现这个社一方面地少人多（每人只有一亩一分地）；另一方面却又有大批荒地没有开垦的情况后，就在党支部大会上提出在巢湖边上开荒四千亩的计划，这个计划立即得到全体党员的热烈支持，也受到了社员的欢迎。决定开荒以后，全社出动一千多个劳动力，连开荒带抢种，不到二十天，就完成了开荒计划，今年单是这四千亩地就给合作社增产了二十万斤麦子。
    丁福民在工作中还很善于运用典型推动一般。合作社每次布置一项任务，他都亲自掌握基础较好的第一生产队先行一步，做出榜样来推动全社。
    去年秋种时，合作社计划利用“冬闲地”把麦子播种面积由七千亩扩大到一万三千亩，但因百余天不雨，地干硬得犁不动，秋种计划很难完成。这时丁福民一面布置各队设法抗旱种麦，一面又深入到第一生产队和社员研究抗旱种麦的办法。他把过去自己在家种田曾在天旱时用锄头刮地种麦的办法表演给社员看，大家觉得这样种效率既高又可以条播，不仅解决了种麦问题，而且解决了下一季套种其他作物的问题。于是全队六十多个劳动力就立刻动手干起来，很快就把一百多亩麦子种下了。接着丁福民就组织全社八十个生产队的队长和党、团员、积极分子到第一队参观，推动全社立即掀起了抗旱抢种的高潮，不到二十天，全社扩大秋种面积的计划就完成了，播种时间比周围的农业社提前了半个月。今年这个社的麦子就由于播种较早，遭受的锈病灾害比周围任何一个社都轻。
    丁福民领导工作中的第三个特点是深入检查及时解决问题。他除了依靠三天一次的干部“碰头会”发现问题外，还亲自有重点的深入不同类型的生产队去检查工作。
    今年麦收打场时，丁福民到建白等四个生产队检查，发现已打的麦秸上还有许多麦粒，很多老年社员都暗自叹息说这“不像过日子的人家”。丁福民立即布置这个队把麦秸重打一遍，结果每亩地麦秸又打出了十五斤左右的麦子。丁福民发现这是个普遍性的问题以后，就在全社生产队长会议上提出“重新翻打麦秸”的意见。结果各队把一万多亩麦秸全部翻打一遍，共打出了二十多万斤麦子。
    丁福民在工作中还善于教育干部克服强迫命令作风。
    这个社的社干部、生产队长大多数是原来的乡、村干部，对领导大型社和生产队都缺乏经验，而且很多人习惯于依靠行政命令作工作。丁福民就教育大家说：“新的任务正逼迫着我们向群众学习，改变我们的作风；否则就要失去群众的信任，辜负党的希望。”
    这个社的副主任贺顺茂分工领导副业生产，但他对磨粉这一项副业的具体业务不懂，去年冬天磨粉师傅尤进江因工作中发生困难，达不到出粉标准。贺顺茂没有调查研究，就主观的以为他思想有问题，指责他说：“干不了就免你的职！”尤进江和负责磨粉的社员听了非常不满。丁福民知道以后就拍拍贺顺茂的肩膀说：“跟我来！”他领着贺顺茂一齐去向尤进江学习如何磨粉，在懂得了磨粉的基本知识以后，就帮助尤进江研究解决了他工作中的困难，使出粉率达到了标准。这时贺顺茂很感动地说：“丁主任用事实教育我改变了工作作风。”
    现在，这个社的社干部和生产队长等自动的提出了“向丁主任学习，转变领导作风”的口号。
