Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th. The double-cropping rice, planted on a large scale for the first time this year in the well-known high-yield rice area of the Western Sichuan Plain, has had an excellent early rice harvest. It is expected to be harvested before the Beginning of Autumn (August 7th). Most of the more than 120,000 mu of early rice yielded more than 400 to 500 jin per mu, equivalent to 80% of the yield of single-season mid-season rice. In Guanghan County, the more than 20,000 mu of early rice generally yielded more than 600 jin per mu.

Currently, farmers on the plain are busy harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice. As of the end of July, more than 70,000 mu of early rice had been harvested, and late rice seedlings had been transplanted in more than 40,000 mu of these fields. Before the Beginning of Autumn, it is expected that late rice will be planted on more than 100,000 mu. This year, a total of more than 189,000 mu of early rice were planted on the Western Sichuan Plain. Due to the first time promotion, the rice varieties used were mixed, and about 60,000 mu could not be planted with late rice due to the late harvesting period and will be replanted with other late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Jishou, 4th. The early rice trial planting of double-cropping rice in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, this year has been successful.

According to harvest statistics from agricultural cooperatives in various places, the general yield is 400 to 500 jin of rice per mu, exceeding the annual yield of previous years in one season. The Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Jishou County has harvested 25 mu of early rice, with an average yield of 531 jin of rice per mu, which is more than 140 jin higher than last year's yield. The Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in this county harvested 705 jin per mu on 1.6 mu of early rice.

This year, the autonomous prefecture trial-planted more than 104,000 mu of double-cropping early rice in areas with better water conservancy conditions, an increase of 200 times compared to last year. The CPC Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee has instructed party committees at all levels to pay attention to seed retention work and prepare for widespread expansion of planting next year.

While harvesting early rice, Miao and Han farmers in the autonomous prefecture are taking advantage of the mornings and evenings to transplant late rice seedlings, striving for a bumper harvest of late rice.

    川西湘西第一年大面积栽种双季稻
    早稻收成很好晚稻正在插种
    新华社成都4日电　著名水稻高产地区川西平原今年第一年大面积栽种的双季稻，早稻收成很好。预计在立秋（八月七日）前可以收割完毕。十二万多亩早稻，大多每亩产四百斤以上到五百斤，相当于单季中稻产量的八成。广汉县的两万多亩早稻，一般每亩收六百斤以上。
    现在，平原上的农民正在紧张地收割早稻和栽插晚稻。到七月底为止，有七万多亩早稻已经收完，其中有四万多亩田里已经插上晚稻秧苗。到立秋前，栽好晚稻的预计可以达到十多万亩。今年川西平原共种植早稻十八万九千多亩。由于第一次推广，采用稻种较杂，约有六万多亩因收割期过迟，无法栽插晚稻，将改种其他晚秋作物。
    新华社吉首4日电　湖南省湘西苗族自治州今年大面积试种双季稻早稻成功。
    据各地农业社收成统计，一般每亩收稻谷四五百斤，一季就超过往年一年产量。吉首县团结农业社已收割的二十五亩早稻，平均每亩收稻谷531斤，比去年产量高一百四十多斤。这个县的红旗农业社的一亩六分早稻，平均每亩收705斤。
    自治州今年在水利条件较好的地区试种的双季稻早稻有十万四千多亩，比去年增加二百倍。中共湘西苗族自治州委员会已指示各级党委注意留种工作，准备明年普遍扩种。
    在收割早稻同时，自治州苗、汉族农民利用早晨和晚上插晚稻秧，争取晚稻丰收。
