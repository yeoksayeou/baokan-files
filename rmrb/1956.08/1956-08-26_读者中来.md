Reader's Letters

A Dead System "Controls" Living People!

The Beijing People's Art Theatre has stipulated a half-month vacation this year. This is indeed good news for actors and stage workers.

Most of the theatre's actors have been performing in the same plays for months, and they should rest. Of course, there are restrictions on the number of vacation slots available, making it impossible to treat everyone equally. In that case, it would be reasonable to give more consideration to the actors within the limited quota. However, this is not the case. Less than half of the actors on the list submitted by the theatre were approved for vacation. The reason is that only cadres at or above the division level are eligible for vacation. Indeed, some of the actors who were approved for vacation had served as division chiefs, or their salary grade was equivalent to that of actors who had served as division chiefs. All the administrative cadres who were approved for vacation were current or former division-level cadres. However, some current division-level cadres have salary grades one or two levels lower than actors who are not on the vacation list. It is worth considering why someone holding the post of division chief does not receive the salary of a division chief, but the question is why actors who are one or two grades higher than current division chiefs cannot take a vacation? If you ask the cadre in charge of personnel in the leading organization, he will say with righteous conviction, "This is the rule, only those at or above the division chief level can take a vacation."

Obviously, it is the position of division chief that is being approved for vacation, not the person. And the cadre in charge of personnel in the leading organization only has dead organizations and systems in his mind, not living people! Organizations and systems are established and formulated by people. Who would have thought that a lifeless organization and system would "control" living people!　Feng Sha

Who is the Author?

Recently, in some newspapers and magazines, article titles and author signatures in illegible cursive script have appeared frequently. Titles in very cursive script are not too important, because even if you can recognize half or most of the characters, you can guess the rest. But when the author's signature is very cursive, it is difficult to recognize. For example, in the article "Don't Forget Our Ancestors!" in the China Youth Daily on July 25th, the character "汉" (Han) in the author "田汉" (Tian Han) is very cursive. Some of us here looked at it and said it was "田蒙" (Tian Meng), and others said it was "田汉" (Tian Han), but no one could be sure. After reading the article, not knowing who the author is, and not being able to tell others who wrote the article when introducing it, is really awkward. I think it is okay for newspapers and magazines to use handwritten titles and signatures to beautify the layout, but they should also take into account the convenience of readers and not write the characters so that they cannot be recognized.　Xue Qin Tang

    死制度“制”住了活人！
    北京人民艺术剧院规定今年有半个月休假。这对演员和舞台工作者来说确实是个喜讯。
    剧院的演员，大多数都是轮回演出好几月的戏了，他们应该休养一下。当然，休养名额有限制，不可能一视同仁，那末在限额以内更多地照顾到演员，恐怕是理所当然的。事实却不然，剧院提上去的演员名单，被批准休养的不到二分之一。理由是只有处级以上的干部才有资格休养。的确，被批准休养的演员有的曾任过处长，或者是薪级相等于曾任过处长的演员的级别。被批准休养的行政干部都是曾任或现任的处级干部。但是现任处级干部的薪级有的比不在休养名单之内的演员还要低一二级。身任处长而拿不到处长的薪级，是值得考虑的事，问题是为什么比现任处长高一二级的演员不能休养？你去问领导机关负责人事的干部，他会振振有词地回说：“这是制度，只有处长以上的才能休养。”
    显然，被批准休养的是处长这个职别，而不是人，而领导机关负责人事工作的干部脑子里有的只是死的机构和制度，而不是活的人！机构和制度本是人设立和制定的，想不到一个没有生命的机构和制度却“制”住了活的人！　风沙
    作者是谁？
    近来在一些报纸杂志上，时常出现难以辨认的草体字的文章标题和作者署名。标题字太草还不大要紧，因为认出其中一半或一大半，其余的字还能猜出来；作者署名一草，可就很难认出来了。比如中国青年报七月二十五日的那篇“不要忘了祖宗！”的文章，作者“田汉”的“汉”字就草得很。我们这里有几个人看了说是“田蒙”，另外几个人又说是，“田汉”，但都不敢肯定。看了文章不晓得作者是谁，要向别人介绍这篇文章说不出是谁写的，真觉得很蹩扭。我认为，报纸杂志用手写体的标题签名来美化版面是可以的，但是也应当照顾到读者的方便，不要把字写得认不出。　学琴堂
