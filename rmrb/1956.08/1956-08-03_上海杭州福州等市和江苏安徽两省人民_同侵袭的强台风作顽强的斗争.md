Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The people of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fuzhou and other cities, and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have shown a tenacious fighting spirit in this typhoon, and are currently restoring normal production and life.

　　On the evening of the 2nd, the center of the strong typhoon had bypassed Shanghai. On the streets, the shops that had been closed have gradually reopened, the number of pedestrians has gradually increased, and some of the cross-river ferries at the mouth of the Huangpu River have also begun to resume operation.

　　In the afternoon, the Municipal Flood Control Headquarters made arrangements for restoring normal urban production and life. More than 10,000 residents who were evacuated from collapsed and damaged houses are now settled in schools and public buildings. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will start issuing temporary subsidies to people with financial difficulties today, and the Real Estate Management Bureau is also preparing to assist them in repairing their homes immediately. During the typhoon, a small number of factories had their production interrupted due to power outages. The Municipal Electric Power Administration is repairing power transmission lines and will prioritize restoring power to them. The Port of Shanghai is also working on formulating a port loading and unloading plan after the typhoon warning is lifted, so that domestic and foreign merchant ships can leave the port as soon as possible. In the suburbs, most of the early rice had been harvested before the typhoon, and about 80% of the vegetables were damaged. The agricultural department is preparing to organize forces to start drainage and replanting immediately. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Flood Control Headquarters, the typhoon was more violent and changed faster than the one in 1949, but because all units had made comprehensive preparations in advance, the losses were not as great as that year.

　　The people of Hangzhou have been fighting a strong typhoon of magnitude 10 or higher since the evening of the 1st. Many cadres and residents stayed up all night, carrying out intense prevention and rescue work. Due to the excessive and fierce wind force, coupled with continuous heavy rain, many old trees along the roads around West Lake and Bai Causeway were uprooted, and many houses collapsed in the Jianggan District. On the morning of the 2nd, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee held an emergency meeting and took emergency measures for rescue and disaster relief. All agencies and departments sent a large number of cadres, workers, and transportation vehicles to various important locations to lead residents in rescue work. Damaged power lines are being vigorously repaired to ensure the safe production of factories. The civil affairs department is actively rescuing affected residents and arranging their accommodation and living.

　　The coastal areas of Fujian have safely passed the typhoon. So far, no casualties, shipwrecks, seawall collapses, or house collapses have been reported. The five British merchant ships docked at Mawei Port were also safe and sound during the typhoon thanks to the care of the Fuzhou Port Authority. During this period, more than 1,000 county and district cadres were sent to the countryside by the counties in the northeast coastal area of Fujian to lead the masses in the anti-typhoon struggle, and Fuzhou City also established a special agency to lead the anti-typhoon struggle.

　　Jiangsu Province was hit by a typhoon on the 2nd. In areas with winds of magnitude 10 or higher, most of the tall-stem crops were flattened, and vine crops also stood up with the wind. Trees suffered varying degrees of damage. Huge waves rose and fell in Taihu Lake. Although the typhoon was very powerful, the people of Jiangsu continued to fight tenaciously.

　　Currently, the wind force on both sides of the Yangtze River and the Huai River in Anhui Province has begun to weaken to magnitude 6 to 7. Before the typhoon passed, the Anhui Provincial Flood Control and Transportation Departments issued emergency instructions on typhoon prevention, and flood control work was generally strengthened on the Yangtze River and the Huai River. Due to the high wind force, crops in the areas through which the typhoon passed suffered damage to varying degrees.

　　Our newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd: The more than 500-kilometer-long seawall in Jiangsu Province, although having experienced typhoons of magnitude 7 to 12 in recent days, has remained standing and undamaged until 11:00 p.m. today, thanks to the continuous struggle of the people of the province against the strong winds and rain. At present, workers protecting the dike are patrolling the dike day and night, and materials for flood and wave prevention are constantly being transported to the front.

　　The Haitang (sea dikes) in the Songjiang Special Zone are more than 200 kilometers long, and have not collapsed at any point due to the continuous rescue and protection of more than 30,000 workers. More than 20,000 workers in Dafeng and Binhai counties persisted in protection during high tide, and immediately rescued the seawalls damaged by the waves after the tide receded, preparing to meet another attack.

    上海杭州福州等市和江苏安徽两省人民
    同侵袭的强台风作顽强的斗争
    据新华社2日讯　在这次台风侵袭中，上海、杭州、福州等市和江苏、安徽两省人民表现了顽强的斗争精神，目前正在恢复正常的生产和生活秩序。
    二日傍晚，强台风中心已经绕过上海。街头上，原来关门的商店已先后恢复营业，行人逐渐增多起来，黄浦江口的部分对江轮渡也已开始复航。
    下午，市防汛总指挥部对恢复城市正常生产和生活的问题做了布置。一万多个从倒塌和吹坏的房屋中迁移出来的居民，现在都被安顿在学校和公共房屋内。市民政局今天起发给生活困难的人临时补助，房地产管理局也准备立即协助他们修复住所。台风中，有少数工厂因停电中断了生产，市电业管理局正在修复输电线，尽先对他们恢复供电。上海港也在着手制定在台风警报解除后的港口装卸计划，使国内外商船早日离港。郊区的早稻在台风前，绝大部分已经抢收完毕，蔬菜约有80％受到损害，农业部门准备组织力量马上开始排水补种。据市防汛总指挥部负责人说，台风比1949年那次来势猛，变化快，但由于各单位事先做了全面防御，损失没有那年大。
    杭州市人民从一日晚起就和十级以上的强台风搏斗着，很多干部居民通宵未睡，进行紧张的御防和抢救工作。由于风力过大过猛，加上连续暴雨，沿西湖周围马路和白堤等地，很多多年的老树都被连根吹倒，江干区一带倒塌了不少房屋。二日晨，中共杭州市委员会，市人民委员会召开了紧急会议，采取了抢救、抢险的紧急措施。各机关、各部门都派出了大批干部、工人和交通工具到各个重要地点去领导居民进行抢救工作。损坏的电线线路正在大力抢修，以保证工厂的安全生产，民政部门正在积极抢救受灾居民，安顿他们居住和生活。
    福建沿海地区已安全度过台风的袭击。至今还没有发现伤亡、船只沉没、海堤崩溃和房屋倒塌等事故。停靠在马尾港的五条英籍商船，因为得到福州港务局的照顾，在台风期间也都平安无事。在这期间，福建东北沿海各县共派出一千多名县区干部到乡村领导群众展开防风斗争，福州市也特别成立了专门机构来领导防风斗争。
    江苏全省二日受到了台风侵袭。风力十级以上的地区，高秆作物大部倒伏，蔓藤作物也随风站起。树木遭到不同程度的损失。太湖里巨浪此起彼伏。虽然台风威力很大，但是江苏各地人民仍顽强地坚持斗争。
    目前安徽省长江两岸和淮河两岸风力已开始减弱到六级到七级。在台风经过之前，安徽省防汛和交通等部门都发出了防风的紧急指示，长江和淮河普遍加强了防汛工作。由于风力大，台风经过的地区农作物曾受到了不同程度的损害。
    本报南京2日电　江苏省连绵五百多公里的海堤，虽然连日来历经七级到十二级台风的袭击，但在全省人民连日与狂风暴雨搏斗下到今日晚上十一时止，江、海、河、湖的主要堤防仍屹立无损。目前，护堤的民工日夜在堤上巡护，防汛防浪的器材源源不断运往前方。
    松江专区海塘长达二百多公里，在三万多民工日夜抢护下，没有一处溃决。大丰、滨海等县二万多民工，在海水涨潮时坚持防护，海潮退后，立即抢救被浪潮打坏的海堤，准备迎接再一次的袭击。
