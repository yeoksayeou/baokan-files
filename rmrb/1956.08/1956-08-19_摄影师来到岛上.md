    Photographer Comes to the Island
    Han Xiao
    The photographer came to the island,
    Soldiers crowded around him,
    Like attending a grand parade,
    All dressed neatly and smartly.

    The camera clicked and whirred,
    A picture taken in a moment;
    One new recruit was so verbose,
    He even flustered the photographer.

    He straightened his cap,
    And touched his shoulder boards,
    Complained his belt was too tight,
    And his shoes not shiny enough.

    He wanted a full-body shot,
    Highlighting the gun in his hand,
    Including the barracks and garden,
    And a bit of the ocean as background.

    He wanted to inscribe a line,
    "Forever guarding the frontier,"
    Then color it in,
    And enlarge it threefold.

    Everyone asked him:
    Why so many prints?
    He said one for my parents,
    One for our cooperative chairman…

    And one more…
    He bit his lip, determined not to say;
    Someone else said it for him:
    That one's for the girl by the Yellow River!

    The soldiers laughed heartily,
    The new recruit's face flushed red:
    He said: "We've finished taking pictures,
    Shouldn't we hurry back to our posts!"

    摄影师来到岛上
    韩笑
    摄影师来到岛上，
    战士们挤在他身旁，
    像参加盛大的检阅，
    都打扮得整洁漂亮。
    照相机卡卡直响，
    一会就照好一张；
    有一个新兵实在囉嗦，
    把摄影师也弄得没有主张。
    他正一正帽子，
    又摸一摸肩章，
    说皮带扎得太紧，
    又嫌皮鞋擦得不亮。
    他要照一个全身，
    还要突出手中的枪，
    要照上营房和花园，
    还要衬一点海洋。
    他要题一行小字，
    “永远守卫边疆”，
    完了还要上色，
    并且放大三张。
    大伙纷纷问他：
    洗这么多干啥？
    他说一张给咱父母，
    一张给咱社长……
    还有一张……
    他咬咬牙决心不讲；
    他不讲有人替他讲了：
    那一张给黄河边上的姑娘！
    战士们哈哈地大笑，
    新兵脸上泛红光：
    他说：“咱们照完相啦，
    还不赶快回去站岗！”
