Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 13th. The Hexi Corridor, a major wheat-producing area in Gansu Province, has achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of wheat. The average yield per mu of the 3.4 million mu of wheat sown throughout the area this year reached 359.66 jin, an increase of 44.46% compared to last year. Zhangye and Linze counties in the central part of the corridor achieved an average yield of over 500 jin per mu, and Dunhuang County outside Jiayuguan increased its average yield per mu by 65% compared to last year. Anxi County, which is prone to sandstorms and known as the "World Wind Depot," also saw yields of 1,000 jin per mu on five mu of wheat. The total increase in wheat production throughout the area compared to last year is more than 460 million jin.

The wheat sowing area in the Hexi Corridor accounts for more than 40% of the total cultivated area. Due to the bumper harvest of wheat, it is guaranteed that the vast majority of the more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the area will achieve increased production, and the income of more than 90% of the cooperative members will increase.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 14th. Farmers and county farms in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province have achieved a bumper harvest of winter wheat on more than 3,600 mu planted with Soviet varieties such as "Odents No. 3," "Ukraine," and Shanxi's "Taiyuan Wheat," with yields ranging from 300 jin to over 800 jin per mu. This autumn, the winter wheat in this area will enter the stage of widespread promotion from the trial planting stage.

The Hexi Corridor is a major spring wheat area in Gansu Province, with nearly 10 million mu of cultivated land mainly irrigated by snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains. Because the water used for spring wheat is concentrated after the beginning of summer (立夏), the irrigation water supply every year at this time falls short of demand, but a large amount of water from autumn to the beginning of summer of the following year has no crops to utilize. After changing to planting some winter wheat, the watering time can be staggered with that of spring wheat, which can solve the water problem. In addition, since winter wheat generally has higher yields and matures earlier than spring wheat, second-season crops can also be planted after harvesting, so that this single-cropping area can be transformed into a double-cropping area.

### 河西走廊春小麦空前丰收  今年增产小麦四亿六千多万斤

    河西走廊春小麦空前丰收
    今年增产小麦四亿六千多万斤
    新华社兰州13日电　甘肃省主要小麦产区河西走廊，小麦获得空前大面积丰收。全区今年共播种的三百四十多万亩小麦，每亩平均产量达到三百五十九点六六斤；比去年提高44.46％。走廊中部的张掖、临泽两县，每亩平均产量达到五百斤以上，嘉峪关外的敦煌县，每亩平均产量比去年增加了65％。风沙灾害较多被称为“世界风库”的安西县，也出现了五亩小麦千斤亩。总计全区比去年增产小麦四亿六千多万斤。
    河西走廊的小麦播种面积占总耕地面积的40％以上，由于小麦丰收，保证了全区四千多个农业生产合作社绝大部分达到社社增产，90％以上的社员收入增加。
    新华社兰州14日电　甘肃省河西走廊农民和各县农场试种的三千六百多亩苏联“奥但斯茨三号”、“乌克兰”和山西的“太原小麦”等品种的冬小麦丰收，每亩产量达到三百斤到八百斤以上。今年秋后这个地区的冬小麦即将由试种阶段进入普遍推广。
    河西走廊是甘肃省的一个主要春小麦区，现有近千万亩耕地主要靠祁连山雪水灌溉。因为春小麦用水都集中在立夏以后，每年这个时候灌溉用水就供不应求，但从秋季到第二年立夏以前大量的水却没有作物可以利用。改种一部分冬小麦后，就能和春小麦的浇水时间互相错开，可以解决用水问题。此外，由于冬小麦一般比春小麦产量高，成熟早，收割之后还可赶种二茬作物，这样，这个一年一熟的地区就可变为一年二熟地区。
