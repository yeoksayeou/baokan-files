Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Electric Dispatch A large-scale chemical factory—the Jilin Fertilizer Plant—is under construction on the banks of the Songhua River.

The Jilin Fertilizer Plant started construction ahead of schedule in the second quarter of last year, during the high tide of agricultural cooperation throughout the country. Currently, it is the most intense period of construction for the entire plant, with civil engineering and equipment installation being carried out simultaneously. Among the more than one hundred construction projects of various sizes, including production plants and warehouses under construction, many have been basically completed. The equipment installation project, which began in the third quarter of last year, is being carried out simultaneously in various factory buildings; some major and large-scale equipment are nearing completion. The construction workers, in order to meet the urgent needs of farmers for increased grain production after agricultural cooperation, are striving to complete the plant construction task ahead of schedule. It is expected that the factory will be put into production in the second half of next year.

The Jilin Fertilizer Plant is a new-style chemical factory. Its main equipment is supplied as a complete set by the Soviet Union. The entire production process, from raw materials to finished products, is controlled by various electrical instruments, and there are safety protection devices on all kinds of equipment.

The nitrogen fertilizer produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant uses the inferior coal near the factory, the water of the Songhua River, and air as raw materials. (Picture attached)

    吉林肥料厂紧张施工
    据新华社长春电　一座规模很大的化学工厂——吉林肥料厂，正在松花江畔兴建。
    吉林肥料厂是在全国农业合作化高潮到来的时候，提前在去年第二季度开工建设的。目前是全厂施工最紧张的时期，土木建筑和设备安装工程正在交错施工。正在建设中的生产厂房和仓库等大小一百多项工程，有许多已经基本完工。从去年第三季度开始进行的设备安装工程，正在各厂房中同时进行；有一些主要的、大型的设备，现在快要安装完成了。建厂职工们为了满足农业合作化以后农民增产粮食的迫切要求，争取提前完成建厂任务。预计这座工厂在明年下半年可以投入生产。
    吉林肥料厂是一座新式的化学工厂。它的主要设备都是由苏联成套供应的。从原料到成品的全部生产过程，都用各种电气仪表控制，而且在各种设备上，都有安全保护装置。
