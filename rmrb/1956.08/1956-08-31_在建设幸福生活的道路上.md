    Soviet Collective Farms Increase Milk Production Continuously
    The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture has summarized the milk production situation in collective farms over the past ten months. During this period, the total milk production of Soviet collective farms increased by nearly 50% compared to the same period of the previous livestock year, and the average milk yield per cow increased by 322 kilograms. Moscow Oblast in the Russian Federation achieved the best results. Collective farms there averaged 2,167 kilograms of milk per cow in nearly ten months. Many union republics and oblasts have already fulfilled their annual milk production plans ahead of schedule.
      In Poland, Each Cooperative Member Household
      Has an Average of Three Cows and Five Pigs
    Livestock farming in Polish agricultural production cooperatives has developed rapidly in recent years. Now, each member household has an average of 3.1 head of cattle (including collectively owned and privately owned), and 4.8 pigs; while in 1950, each cooperative member household had an average of only 1.3 head of cattle and 1.4 pigs.
    Compared with individual farmers, the development of livestock farming in cooperatives is much faster. From 1950 to the present, the number of cattle per 100 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of land in cooperatives has increased by an average of 12.2 head, and pigs have increased by 28.7 head; while individual farmers' cattle and pigs have only increased by 5.7 head and 6.8 head respectively. Now, each individual farmer household has an average of only two head of cattle and nearly three pigs.
    North Korea Trains Large Numbers of Agricultural Technicians
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea pays attention to training technical personnel in agricultural economics. The number of experts engaged in agricultural production and research is now twice that of the pre-war period.
    North Korea now has an agricultural college, a veterinary and animal husbandry college, a senior agricultural school, and thirty-seven agricultural specialized schools.
    In the agricultural cooperative cadre training center, more than 350 agricultural cooperative managers are studying agricultural technology. This training center has trained more than 600 technical cadres. More than 5,700 people have also participated in technical and economic training courses in agricultural enterprises.
    In addition, more than 100 trained people have been sent to the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries to learn advanced agricultural technology.
    Mongolia Decides to Establish Livestock Machinery Stations
    The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian Council of Ministers have decided to establish livestock machinery stations and take measures to strengthen existing hay mowing stations that provide horses and tools for hay mowing, both organizationally and economically.
    It is now planned to merge some existing hay mowing stations from 1956 to 1957 in order to organize ten livestock machinery stations. These machinery stations will, according to agreements they reach with herding cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, cultivate fields, fertilize, sow seeds, harvest grains, and collect hay, and provide facilities for electric sheep shearing and artificial insemination of livestock. Hay mowing stations will also carry out such work; hay mowing stations have so far only engaged in hay purchasing work. Cash and in-kind rewards will be given for the work carried out.

    在建设幸福生活的道路上
    苏联农庄牛奶产量不断增加
    苏联农业部总结了最近十个月集体农庄牛奶生产的情况，在这个期间，苏联集体农庄的牛奶总产量几乎比上一个畜牧业年度的同期增加了50％，每头奶牛的平均出奶量增加了三百二十二公斤。成绩最好的是俄罗斯联邦的莫斯科州。那里的集体农庄近十个月内平均从每头奶牛身上挤了二千一百六十七公斤牛奶。许多加盟共和国和州已经提前超额完成了今年全年的牛奶生产计划。
      波兰每户合作社社员
      平均有三头牛五口猪
    波兰农业生产合作社的畜牧业近几年来得到了迅速的发展。现在平均每一户社员有三点一头牛（包括公有的和私有的），四点八口猪；而在1950年合作社社员平均每一户只有一点三头牛，一点四口猪。
    和个体农民比较，合作社的畜牧业的发展要快得多。从1950年到现在，合作社每一百公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地上的牛平均增加了十二点二头，猪增加了二十八点七口；而个体农民的牛和猪只分别增加了五点七头和六点八口。现在，每一户个体农民平均只有两头牛和将近三口猪。
    朝鲜大量培养农业技术人员
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国注意培养农业经济方面的技术人员。目前从事农业生产和研究方面的专家为战前的两倍。
    朝鲜现在设立有农业学院、兽医和动物驯养学院、高级农业学校以及三十七个农业专门学校。
    在农业合作社干部训练中心，有三百五十多个农业合作社管理人员正在学习农业技术。这个训练中心已经培养出六百多个技术干部。还有五千七百多人参加了农业企业的技术和经济训练班。
    另外还有一百多个受过训练的人已经被派到苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家去学习先进的农业技术。
    蒙古决定设立畜牧业机器站
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和蒙古部长会议决定设立畜牧业机器站，并且采取措施在组织上和经济上加强现有的提供割草的马匹和工具的割草站。
    现在计划从1956年到1957年之内合并一些现有的割草站以便组织十个畜牧业机器站。这些机器站将根据它们同牧民合作社和农业合作社取得的协议，耕耘田地、施肥、播种、收割谷物和积草，并且在电剪羊毛和对牲畜进行人工受精等方面提供便利。割草站也将进行这样的工作，割草站到现在为止只从事购草工作。对于所进行的工作将给予现金和实物作为报酬。
