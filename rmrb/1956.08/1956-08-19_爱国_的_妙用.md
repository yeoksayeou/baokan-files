    The "Wonderful Use" of "Patriotism"
    Lin Xi
    Not long ago, some commercial departments forcefully pushed their stockpiled, slow-moving, and damaged goods onto the masses, claiming it was to accumulate funds for national construction. If people didn't buy, they were accused of not supporting socialist construction and being unpatriotic. Recently, the Dezhou City Grain Bureau in Shandong Province stipulated that for every purchase of grain, an equal amount of "patriotic grain" (a kind of bitter, moldy grain) must be purchased as well.
    Calling the bitter, moldy grain "patriotic grain" has a reason. It is said that the Grain Bureau believes that if this batch of grain isn't sold, the country will suffer losses, and the grain storage personnel will also be punished! Although the bad grain is harder to eat, it can still fill your belly. So, they brought out a loud political slogan—eat "patriotic grain"—to "motivate" the masses to obey "overall" interests.
    However, this kind of "motivation" didn't work; on the contrary, it caused an uproar in the city. In all the grain stations in Dezhou City, there were noises of argument and accusation everywhere. Some people said: Eating this "patriotic grain" causes vomiting and diarrhea, which affects production. Can this be considered patriotism? Some people asked: The Grain Bureau ruined the grain, but the masses have to suffer. Is that reasonable?
    The masses have raised their opinions, and those political agitators who insisted on making people eat "patriotic grain" should have thought about it carefully. But they said, "The socialist consciousness of the masses is too low." They even said: "When the Red Army did the 25,000-li Long March, they ate tree bark and grass roots. Don't be too ungrateful!" What is the relationship between socialism and eating moldy grain? The Red Army did indeed eat tree bark and grass roots, but this is definitely not the era of the Red Army eating grass roots and tree bark. Did the Red Army endure all those hardships back then to create an excuse for those who didn't do their job well to shirk responsibility?
    Responsibility can no longer be shirked. The people of Dezhou City, under the hat of "patriotism," have already eaten moldy grain five times since the unified purchase and sale of grain; if the responsibility isn't investigated, it will be difficult to guarantee that they won't eat moldy grain six, seven, or more times.
    Why did the grain become moldy? Poor storage conditions are a fact, but the emergence of a large number of "four-without" granaries across the country is also a fact. If the storage conditions are too poor, efforts should be made to improve them, instead of sitting idly by and watching the grain repeatedly rot; if the storage personnel are derelict in their duties, they should be punished; if they have made their best efforts and the grain still rots, although it is excusable, they shouldn't use coercive measures to sell it to the masses!

    “爱国”的“妙用”
    林晰
    不久以前，有些商业部门把积压的冷背残货强向群众推销，说是为了给国家建设积累资金。不买，就说是不支持社会主义建设，不爱国。最近，又有山东德州市粮食局规定：凡买粮食，就要搭配同等数量的“爱国粮”（一种苦涩的霉粮）。
    把苦涩的霉粮称做“爱国粮”，是有原由的。据说，粮食局认为这批粮食如果不卖掉，国家就要遭受损失，而且粮食保管人员也得受处分！坏粮虽然难吃些，可是总还能饱饱肚皮。于是，他们搬出了响亮的政治口号——吃“爱国粮”——来“动员”群众服从“整体”利益。
    但是，这种“动员”不起作用；相反地，引起了满城风雨。德州市各售粮站里到处是吵闹和指责的声音。有人说：吃了这种“爱国粮”，上吐下泻，影响生产，这能算爱国？有人问：粮食局把粮食保管坏了，却叫群众遭殃，说得过去吗？
    群众提出了意见，那些硬要人们吃“爱国粮”的政治鼓动家照理说应该好好想一想了。但是，他们却说“群众的社会主义觉悟太低了”。甚至说：“红军二万五千里长征的时候，吃树皮草根都过了，不要太不知足啊！”社会主义和吃霉粮究竟有什么关系呢？红军确实吃过树皮草根，但现在也的确不是红军吃草根树皮的时代了。红军当年历尽艰辛，难道是为了给后来没把工作做好的人们制造推卸责任的借口？
    责任不能再推卸了。德州市人民在“爱国”的帽子下，从粮食统购统销以来已经吃了五次霉粮；如果不追究一下责任，就很难保证他们不吃六次、七次或更多次的霉粮。
    粮食为什么霉烂了？保管条件差是事实，但是全国出现大批“四无”粮仓也是事实。如果保管条件太差的话，就应该设法改进，而不该坐视粮食屡次霉烂；如果是保管人员不尽职，那就该受处分；如果尽了最大努力，仍然霉烂的话，虽然情有可原，但也不该用强迫的手段卖给群众呀！
