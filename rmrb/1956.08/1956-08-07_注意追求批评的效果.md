    Pay Attention to Pursuing the Effect of Criticism
    Reader's letters request that the editorial department of this newspaper pay attention to pursuing the effect of criticisms published in the newspaper. For example, Li Chenghua wrote that he is very concerned about the People's Daily's criticism on July 10th of the leaders of the Hankou Navigation Engineering Zone of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Navigation Administration for not caring about the well-being of the workers. However, the newspaper has not yet published the response of those criticized. He believes that the editorial department should urge those criticized to reply to the criticism, and if the criticism is incorrect, those criticized should be asked to express their opinions. Reader Yi Ru wrote, requesting this newspaper to publish the results of the handling of the matters criticized in "The Voice of Demobilized Soldiers." The Party member's letter published by this newspaper entitled "Is it a Leader? Or a Mouthpiece?" criticized the bureaucratic work style of several leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Taxation Bureau, and published an editorial on this issue, which attracted the attention of many readers; some readers wrote requesting the newspaper to report on the effect of this criticism.
    The readers' opinions are correct. Recently, the editorial department of this newspaper has not paid enough attention to the issue of pursuing the effect of criticism. There have been very few responses to our newspaper's criticism published in the newspaper, and we are now working to improve this. At the same time, we also hope that those criticized can reply to this newspaper's criticism as soon as possible, and tell us whether the criticism is factual and appropriate. We also hope that other readers will inform us of the effect of our newspaper's criticism at any time.

### 注意追求批评的效果

    注意追求批评的效果
    读者来信，要求本报编辑部注意追求在报纸上开展批评的效果。例如李承华来信说，他很关心七月十日人民日报对长江航运管理局汉口航道工程区领导人员不关心职工疾苦的批评，可是，到现在报纸还没有发表被批评者的反应。他认为编辑部应该督促被批评者答复批评，如果批评有不正确的地方，也应该请被批评者发表意见。读者伊如来信，要求本报发表在“复员军人的呼声”中所批评的事情的处理结果。本报发表的题为“是领导人呢？是传声筒呢？”的党员来信，批评了浙江省税务局几个领导人的官僚主义作风，并为此发表了社论，引起了很多读者的注意；有些读者来信要求报纸报道这一批评的效果。
    读者的意见是对的。近来，本报编辑部对于追求批评的效果问题，确实注意得不够，报纸上发表的对本报批评的反应也很少，现在正在加以改进。同时，我们也希望被批评者能够尽快地答复本报的批评，对于本报批评得是不是事实，批评得恰不恰当，都希望告诉我们。并希望其它读者随时向我们反映有关本报批评效果的情况。
