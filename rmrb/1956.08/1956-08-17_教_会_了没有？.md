Title: Have You Taught Them "How"?

When a baby can walk independently without needing adult support, we say, "He has learned to walk," meaning he has the ability to walk.

"To be able" means being able to live and work independently without needing help from others. If someone can ride a bicycle without needing assistance, we say they can ride a bicycle. If someone can swim without using a rubber ring, we say they can swim. Similarly, if someone can read independently without the need for a teacher's assistance, we say they can read. This is a simple principle.

Therefore, a teacher's most basic responsibility should be to teach students "how" to read, to enable them to have the ability to think and work. However, the issue of students' independent working ability is currently causing a great stir, which is regrettable. If students study for several years and still cannot think or work, what exactly have the teachers taught them "how" to do?

In fact, the problem of teaching people "how" exists in education at home, in kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and universities. For example, a child is born knowing how to sleep and play, but adults insist on holding them to sleep and accompanying them to play, hindering the development of independent living skills. This is the first hurdle. When a child learns to walk and accidentally falls, they are fully capable of getting up on their own and are about to do so, but our kind-hearted parents insist on helping them up, denying them the opportunity for independent living. When children grow up, they can dress themselves, but adults still dress them; they can make their own beds, but adults still make them. In family life, their ability to work independently is taken away. When they enter school, students like to draw what they like, but teachers insist that they copy drawings, and independent working ability encounters another hurdle. When they enter middle school, the teacher's responsibility should be to teach students some knowledge and skills so that they can use this knowledge and skills to work independently. However, some of our teachers seem to be afraid of exhausting the students' brains, so the exercises they give are mostly the same as those in the books, or slightly modified. In some subjects, students simply memorize by rote. Isn't it the same when they enter university? Usually, teachers lecture on four points, and you can only answer those four points; more is not allowed, and less is even worse. During class, students copy notes; after class, they compare notes; and for exams, they memorize notes. As long as they memorize it well, they are guaranteed a good grade. With this kind of teaching method, it is no wonder that the problem of students' "independent working ability" has become a serious issue.

Therefore, the issue of independent living, independent thinking, and independent working ability should be discussed not only in universities, but also in kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools. Not only should teachers study this issue, but parents should also think about family education.

### 教“会”了没有？

    教“会”了没有？
    周政
    一个婴儿，当他不需要大人搀扶能自己独立迈步的时候，我们说：“他已会走路了”，就是说他已具有会走路的能力了。
    “会”就是不需要别人帮助而能自己独立生活和独立工作。一个人不需要别人搀扶能骑车，我们说他会骑车了；一个人不需要用橡皮圈，能自己游泳，我们说他会游泳了；同样的，一个人能自己独立地阅读不需要教师的辅助，我们就说他会读书了，这是简单的道理。
    所以，作为一个教师，他的最起码的责任应当是教“会”学生读书，使他们有思考和工作的能力。可是现在关于学生的独立工作能力问题正闹得满城风雨，这不能不说是一件令人遗憾的事。学生学了几年，连思考和工作都做不到，教师究竟教“会”了什么呢？
    事实上教“会”人的问题，在家庭、幼儿园、小学、中学、大学的教育中都存在着。例如，孩子一生出来自己会睡，会玩，大人偏要抱着他睡，陪着他玩，培养独立生活的能力在这里遇到第一关。孩子会走路了，一不小心跌了一交，他完全能自己爬起来，并正预备这样做，我们好心肠的父母，偏要扶他起来，不让他有独立生活的机会。孩子长大了，自己会穿衣服，大人还要替他穿；自己会铺床了，大人还要替他铺。在家庭生活中剥夺了他独立工作的能力。进了学校，学生喜欢自己画画，画他最喜爱的对象，老师却偏要他照着画画，独立工作能力又遇到另一关。进了中学，教师的责任应当是教会学生一些知识、技巧，使他能运用这些知识和技巧独立地工作，可是我们有些教师像是怕绞尽了学生的脑汁似的，出的习题多半是和书上相同，或略有变更，有的科目学生干脆死背。进大学后又何尝不是如此，平时教师讲的是四点，你只能回答四点，多一点不行，少一点更不成。平时上课抄笔记，下课对笔记，考试背笔记，只要背熟，准得五分。这么样教法，难怪学生“独立工作能力”的问题要成为严重的问题了。
    因此，独立生活、独立思考和独立工作能力的问题不只是大学里要讨论，幼儿园、小学、中学都应当讨论。不仅教师要研究这问题，做父母的也应当想一下家庭教育。
