Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: Joint Statement of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos

Since ancient times, China and Laos have been friendly neighbors. Only at the end of the last century, due to foreign intrusion, was the connection between the two countries interrupted. Now, both China and Laos have gained independence and freedom, and both are eager to restore traditional friendly ties. Although the two countries have different political and social systems, this does not prevent them from establishing close economic and cultural ties.

Starting from this common aspiration, at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, led a delegation of the government of the Kingdom of Laos on a friendly visit to China in August 1956.

During its stay in Beijing, the delegation of the Kingdom of Laos was received by Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China and held friendly talks.

The Chinese Premier and the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos held talks. Participating in the talks, on the side of the People's Republic of China, were also: Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian; on the side of the Kingdom of Laos, there were: His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith and His Excellency Leuam Insisienmay, Minister of Finance, National Economy, and Planning.

The talks were filled with an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship from beginning to end. The two sides reached a complete agreement on the following points:

(1) The Government of the Kingdom of Laos declares that it will resolutely pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, will not enter into any military alliances, and, provided that its security is not threatened, will not allow the establishment of any foreign military bases on its territory other than those stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The Government of the People's Republic of China expresses its full respect and support for the above-mentioned position of the Government of the Kingdom of Laos.

(2) The governments of the two countries agree to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (Panchasila) established in the Sino-Indian Declaration and to develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries. Both sides are willing to promote the relations between local authorities located on the borders of the two countries to the greatest extent possible.

(3) The governments of the two countries agree to develop economic and cultural relations between them to conform to the greatest interests of the peoples of China and Laos.
