Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th August. China Medical University held its first scientific paper conference from August 4th to 7th, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the university's founding.

Teachers from China Medical University and Soviet experts presented 145 scientific papers at the conference. The paper topics covered nine areas, including hygiene, anatomy and histology, and infectious diseases. Guests from more than 50 medical units and scientific research institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin, Changchun, Dalian, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also participated in the discussions. There were more than 4,000 attendees.

At the surgical sub-conference, representatives from the general surgery teaching and research group of the medical department and the clinical surgery teaching and research group made reports on "Experience in Surgical Treatment of Cerebellar Tumors," "Surgery for Constrictive Pericarditis," and "Preliminary Summary of Lung Resection Experience."

Since 1954, when surgeons began performing brain surgery, they have achieved good results. They have removed tumors from the cerebellums of many patients on the verge of death, giving them a new lease on life. From 1953 to January of this year, surgeons admitted a total of twenty-six patients who needed pericardial stripping surgery. After surgery, the vast majority of them regained their health.

In recent years, China Medical University has also achieved results in carrying out scientific research closely related to industrial and agricultural production. The reports presented at the hygiene sub-conference, such as "Investigation of the Prevalence of Silicosis Among Dust Workers in the Material Preparation Section of the Benxi Refractory Materials Factory," "Research Methods on Morbidity Rates in Industrial and Mining Enterprises," "Clinical Investigation and Analysis of Kashin-Beck Disease," and "Rural Hygiene After Cooperativization," have attracted the attention of relevant parties. Some reports also proposed improvement measures. For example, teachers at this school, based on the actual situation of the Benxi Refractory Materials Factory and together with engineers, have proposed a comprehensive dust prevention plan for construction in 1957.

    中国医科大学
    举行第一次科学论文报告会
    新华社沈阳9日电　中国医科大学在八月四日到七日举行第一次科学论文报告会，纪念校庆二十五周年。
    中国医科大学的教师和苏联专家在报告会上提出了一百四十五篇科学论文。论文题目包括卫生、解剖组织、传染病等九个方面。参加讨论的还有来自北京、上海、哈尔滨、长春、旅大和内蒙古自治区的五十多个医疗单位和科学研究机关的来宾。听众达四千多人次。
    在讨论会外科分会上，医疗系总论外科教研组、临床外科教研组等的代表作了关于“小脑肿瘤外科治疗的体会”、“窄缩性心包炎手术”、“肺切除初步经验总结”等报告。
    外科医师们从1954年开始作脑科手术以来，已经取得了良好效果，他们从许多濒于死境的患者的小脑里摘出肿瘤后，使患者重新获得了生命。从1953年到今年1月，外科医生们共接纳了二十六名需要实行心包剥离手术的患者，经过手术后，绝大多数人重新恢复了健康。
    几年来中国医科大学在密切结合工、农业生产开展科学研究工作上，也取得了效果。报告会卫生分会提出的“本溪耐火材料厂制料工段粉尘工人矽肺患病率的调查”、“工矿企业患病率的研究方法”、“大骨节病的临床调查分析”、“合作化后的农村卫生”的报告，都引起了有关方面的重视。在某些报告中还提出了改进措施。如这个学校的教师已经根据本溪耐火材料厂的实际情况，和工程师一起，提出了1957年准备施工的综合性防尘措施计划。
