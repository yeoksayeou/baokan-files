Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 7th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published an observer's article on the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, refuting Japan's unreasonable demand to hand over the Soviet territories of Kunashir and Iturup islands to Japan.

The observer pointed out that the Japanese side is putting forward new "grounds" to justify its territorial claims. It says that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation have nothing to do with the Yalta Agreement, which stipulated the return of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union. The observer pointed out that it is basic common sense that the Potsdam Proclamation was made on the basis of the Cairo Declaration and the Yalta Agreement.

The observer also refuted another Japanese "argument," namely, that because the Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco Peace Treaty, it cannot invoke this treaty to prove that Japan has abandoned its claims to Kunashir and Iturup islands. He said that raising the issue in this way is unfounded. The San Francisco Peace Treaty explicitly stipulates that Japan renounces the Kuril Islands, which is fully legally binding on Japan, which signed the document.

The observer pointed out that the Japanese side is trying to use the territorial issue to obtain further concessions from the Soviet Union. But such a gamble is dangerous and can only benefit those who oppose the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

The observer pointed out that at Japan's request, the Soviet Union has already agreed to include several new clauses in the draft peace treaty, although these clauses are not in the interests of the Soviet Union. Taking into account Japan's international obligations and its urgent demands, the Soviet side has agreed to delete from the draft peace treaty the clause stipulating that Japan guarantees not to participate in any military alliances directed against other countries. On the fisheries issue, the Soviet Union has made considerable concessions to Japan. Finally, in order to reach a reconciliation with Japan, the Soviet Union has made another generous offer, agreeing to transfer the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan. The observer concluded by saying that Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, representing the Soviet government at the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the 6th, reiterated that the Soviet Union does not agree to make further concessions. This is the final position of the Soviet side.

### 苏联“真理报”发表观察家文章  驳斥日本对苏联领土无理要求

    苏联“真理报”发表观察家文章
    驳斥日本对苏联领土无理要求
    据新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联“真理报”今天刊载观察家关于苏日谈判的文章，驳斥日本坚持把苏联领土国后岛和择捉岛移交给日本的无理要求。
    观察家指出，日本方面在提出新的“根据”为它的领土要求辩解。它说开罗宣言和波茨坦公告同规定把千岛群岛归还苏联的雅尔塔协定没有关系。观察家指出，波茨坦公告是在开罗宣言和雅尔塔协定的基础上作出的，这完全是起码的常识。
    观察家还驳斥了日本的另一个“论据”，即借口苏联没有在旧金山和约上签字，所以它不能引用这个条约来证明日本放弃了对国后岛和择捉岛的要求。他说，这样提问题是毫无根据的。旧金山和约明文规定日本放弃千岛群岛，这对在这个文件上签字的日本是有充分的法律约束力的。
    观察家指出，日本方面企图利用领土问题取得苏联的进一步让步。但是这种赌博是危险的，只能有利于反对苏日关系正常化的人们。
    观察家指出，苏联在日本的要求下已经同意在和约草案中列入若干新条款，虽然这些条款并不符合苏联的利益。苏联方面考虑到日本所承担的国际义务和它迫切的要求，已经同意从和约草案中删去规定日本保证不参加任何针对其他国家的军事联盟的条款。在渔业问题上，苏联向日本作了相当大的让步。最后，苏联为了同日本达成和解，已经作了另一次慷慨的表示，同意把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交给日本。观察家最后说，苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在六日的苏日谈判中代表苏联政府曾经重申，苏联不同意作进一步的让步。这是苏联方面的最后态度。
