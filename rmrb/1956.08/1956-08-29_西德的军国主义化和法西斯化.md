    The Militarization and Fascistization of West Germany
    Wang Keqin
    In July, the Adenauer government of West Germany forced the Federal Parliament to pass the conscription law, and in August, the Federal Constitutional Court illegally declared the German Communist Party illegal. These two events indicate that West Germany has taken a step further on the road to militarization and fascistization.
    Whether it is rearmament or the persecution of the Communist Party, these are things that the West German ruling clique has been plotting for a long time. In postwar West Germany, the Potsdam Agreement was trampled upon. The forces of militarists and revanchists have been condoned, encouraged, and cultivated by Western countries, while the forces of peace and democracy have often been restricted, attacked, and persecuted. Due to the entry into force of the Paris Agreements, the Adenauer government is actively building a large army. Adenauer has repeatedly emphasized that the military buildup plan must be completed within three years.
    In March of this year, it forced parliament to pass the Constitutional Amendment Act and the Soldiers Act. The former defines the military powers of the executive and legislative organs of the Federal Republic authorities, while the latter allows the Adenauer government to recruit more than 150,000 officers and soldiers as the backbone of the regular division. After the conscription law was passed and approved in July of this year, West Germany completed the legislative procedures for conscription. This bill stipulates that the government can forcibly conscript all West German men aged 18 to 45 to serve in the military. This enables the Bonn government to use universal conscription to realize its plan to build an army of 500,000. West German Defense Minister Blank once again announced that the first batch of West German youths will be conscripted into the army in October this year; and an army with 96,000 people will be established by the end of this year. He also openly declared that the new West German army will possess atomic weapons. It is worth noting that even the West German ruling clique admits that the future West German army will far exceed 500,000.
    The process of West German rearmament is also the process of establishing and strengthening the "Washington-Bonn Axis." According to the "Defense Mutual Assistance Agreement" signed between the United States and West Germany at the end of June last year, American officers are currently openly training the backbone of the West German army, navy, and air force, and the United States is openly supplying West Germany with a large number of weapons.
    West German rearmament runs counter to the overall trend of easing international tensions. Just as leaders of many countries are visiting each other to discuss various issues that will help further ease international tensions, just as countries are seeking universal disarmament, just as some countries are voluntarily disarming, especially when the Soviet Union decided to disarm another 1.2 million troops and the German Democratic Republic also decided to disarm 30,000 troops, just as the Soviet Union withdrew 30,000 troops from the German Democratic Republic, the Adenauer government is keen to implement conscription laws, accelerate the expansion of armaments, and is determined to maintain the "Cold War" and increase tensions.
    The implementation of the conscription law in West Germany and the establishment of a new Hitler Wehrmacht will undoubtedly worsen the situation in Europe. The West German army being built will still be an army infused with the traditional "Prussian spirit" and revanchist ideas. At the same time, it will be the core of the armed forces of the aggressive military bloc, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The people of European countries deeply remember how the German militarist forces brought them disaster more than once, and how the jackboots of the Nazi army trampled on their territory. How can they not worry and oppose West German rearmament?
    West German rearmament seriously endangers the interests of the German nation. Some figures in the West German ruling clique vainly attempt to unify Germany by force. This attempt will never be realized. Direct negotiations between the two Germanys are the only way to reunify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The implementation of the West German conscription law has further complicated the solution of the German question. The arms race itself will also plague West Germany's national economy and people's livelihood. The situation in many countries of the North Atlantic Group can be used as a reference.
    This militaristic policy of the Adenauer government is only beneficial to German monopoly capital, militarists, and large American consortia. Therefore, the Bonn government is increasingly isolated internationally and increasingly unpopular at home.
    Today, a powerful force against rearmament and demanding the peaceful reunification of the motherland has emerged in West Germany. "Oppose the conscription law!" has become the unanimous slogan of patriots from all walks of life in West Germany. They have expressed their opposition to the government's current policies through various means such as rallies, demonstrations, writing appeals, and holding opinion polls. Many political parties and groups in West Germany have expressed their opposition to the conscription law.
    A series of facts show that the Adenauer group's power is weakening, and the implementation of the conscription law is difficult. The position of Adenauer's government alliance in the Federal Parliament has long been weakened. The parliamentary groups of the Refugee Party and the Free Democratic Party have successively withdrawn from the government alliance. Despite the enormous pressure exerted by Adenauer, when the conscription law was passed in the third reading in the Federal Parliament, those who voted in favor only accounted for slightly more than 55%. The situation in the Senate is also not optimistic. Among the representatives of the nine state governments in West Germany, only 21 votes from five states voted in favor, while 17 votes from four states voted against. Due to Adenauer's stubborn policies, the Christian Democratic Union has lost 3.5 million votes in state elections since 1954. Some members of Adenauer's own party have also criticized Adenauer's policies. Some former German soldiers and a small number of officers in the current West German Ministry of Defense have also expressed deep dissatisfaction with Adenauer.
    The West German government has encountered many thorny issues in recruiting troops. In order to avoid becoming cannon fodder, a large number of West German youths have flocked to the German Democratic Republic. In the democratic district of Berlin alone, 1,365 West German youths requested accommodation in June of this year alone. When the government transferred more than 16,000 border police officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Defense to be incorporated into the army, more than 7,000 of them were unwilling to join the army. Those who originally registered for recruitment also requested cancellation of their registration one after another.
    Of course, the most determined and powerful force in the struggle against the rearmament of the Adenauer government is the German Communist Party.
    Faced with the huge wave of West German people opposing militarization, the West German ruling clique is panicked. In order to consolidate its own regime and to clear the obstacles on the road to rearmament, the West German government has intensified its offensive against the forces of peace and democracy. It first attacked the German Communist Party.
    The West German government's purpose in carrying out this attack on the working class is obviously to intimidate the broad masses of the people and force them to obediently serve as cannon fodder for the new war planned by the militarists. This arbitrary action further shows that the Bonn ruling clique is attempting to take an adventurous road towards the so-called unification of the country. This shows that some people in West Germany are paving the way for war. Along with the advancement of militarization, the West German regime is increasingly moving towards fascistization. These two are twin brothers. They are deadly enemies of the interests of the German nation and the cause of peace. Neither the German people nor peace-loving people of all countries can tolerate it.
    The progressive forces of the whole world support and sympathize with the German Communist Party and resolutely oppose the arbitrary actions of the West German militarists. History proves that the German Communist Party cannot be eliminated. The Communist Party represents the interests of the working class and the people, and is the most staunch defender of peace, democracy, and freedom. The German Communist Party, which has grown up in struggle, will surely strengthen its own strength in the future struggle to win a bright future for the German nation.
    At present, the West German ruling clique's implementation of militaristic and fascist measures such as the compulsory military service system and the banning of the Communist Party have more clearly exposed its own anti-people and anti-peace features. Its international and domestic status will inevitably be further weakened. The West German people are waging an unyielding struggle to defend peace, democracy, and freedom, and to end the terrorist rule of the West German militarists, and victory will belong to them.

    西德的军国主义化和法西斯化
    王克勤
    西德的阿登纳政府在七月使联邦议院通过征兵法，八月又使联邦宪法法院非法宣布德国共产党非法。这两件事表明：西德已在军国主义化和法西斯化的道路上迈进了一步。
    无论是重新武装，或是迫害共产党，都是西德统治集团蓄谋已久的事情。在战后的西德，波茨坦协定遭到了践踏。军国主义分子和复仇主义分子的势力获得西方国家的姑息、鼓励和培植，而和平民主力量经常受到限制、打击和迫害。由于巴黎协定的生效，阿登纳政府正在积极建立一支庞大的军队。阿登纳一再强调，要在三年内完成建军计划。
    今年三月间，它使议会通过了宪法补充法案和士兵法案。前者确定了联邦共和国当局执行机关和立法机关的军事权能，后者则允许阿登纳政府募集十五万以上的军官和士兵，作为正规师的骨干。今年七月通过和批准了征兵法后，西德就完成了征兵的立法手续。这个法案规定，政府得以强迫征召西德所有十八岁到四十五岁的男子服兵役。这使波恩政府能用普遍征兵的方法，来实现它建立五十万军队的计划。西德国防部长布兰克曾再次宣布，要在今年十月间开始征召第一批西德青年参加军队；而在今年年底将建立一支拥有九万六千人的军队。他并公然宣称，新的西德军队将拥有原子武器。值得注意的是，连西德统治集团也承认，未来的西德军队将远远超过五十万之谱。
    西德重新武装的过程，也是“华盛顿—波恩轴心”的建立和加强的过程。根据去年六月底签订的美国和西德的“防御互助协定”，目前美国的军官正在公开训练西德海陆空军的骨干，美国公开以大量武器供应西德。
    西德的重新武装是同整个国际局势的缓和趋向背道而驰的。正当许多国家的领导人相互访问，商讨有助于进一步缓和国际局势的各项问题的时候，正当各国在谋求普遍裁军的时候，正当有些国家自动裁军，特别是苏联决定再次裁军一百二十万、德意志民主共和国也决定裁军三万的时候，正当苏联把三万驻军从民主德国撤回的时候，阿登纳政府却热衷于实行征兵法，加紧扩充军备，一心要保持“冷战”，增加紧张局势。
    西德实施征兵法，建立新的希特勒国防军，无疑地将使欧洲局势恶化。正在建立的西德军队，仍将是一支灌注着传统的“普鲁士精神”和复仇主义思想的军队，同时，它又将是侵略性的军事集团北大西洋公约组织武装部队的核心。欧洲各国人民深切地记得，德国军国主义势力是怎样不只一次地给他们带来灾难，纳粹军队的皮靴是怎样蹂躏他们的国土的。对于西德重新武装，他们能不忧虑，能不反对吗？
    西德的重新武装严重地危害着德国民族利益。西德统治集团的某些人物妄想以武力统一德国的，这个企图是永远不可能实现的。两个德国之间进行直接谈判，是使德国在和平民主基础上重新统一的唯一的道路。西德征兵法的实施，使德国问题的解决越发复杂化了。扩军备战本身并将使西德的国计民生遭殃。北大西洋集团不少国家的境况是可以作为借鉴的。
    阿登纳政府的这种军国主义化的政策仅仅对德国垄断资本、军国主义分子以及美国的大财团有利。因此，波恩政府在国际上日益孤立，在国内日益不得人心。
    在今天的西德已经出现了一支反对重新武装、要求和平统一祖国的强大力量。“反对征兵法！”已成为西德各阶层爱国人士的一致口号。他们纷纷以集会、示威游行、写呼吁信、举行民意测验等种种方式，来表示反对政府的现行政策。西德许多党派团体都表示反对征兵法。
    一系列的事实说明，阿登纳集团势力在削弱，征兵法的推行是困难的。阿登纳的政府联盟在联邦议院中的地位早已削弱。难民党和自由民主党的议会党团先后退出政府联盟。尽管阿登纳加施了巨大的压力，在联邦议院三读通过征兵法时，投赞成票的也只占55％强。在参议院中，情况也不妙，在西德九个州政府的代表中，投赞成票的只有五个州的二十一票，而投反对票的有四个州的十七票。由于阿登纳执行顽固的政策，已经使基督教民主联盟在自1954年以来的州选举中丧失了三百五十万张选票。在阿登纳自己的党内也有人指责阿登纳的政策。一些前德国军人和现在西德国防部的少数军官对阿登纳也深表不满。
    西德政府在招兵买马时，碰到不少棘手的问题。为了避免充当炮灰，大批西德青年投奔民主德国。仅今年六月一个月，在柏林民主区一地，要求收容的西德青年有一千三百六十五人。在政府把一万六千多名边防警察由内务部转交给国防部编为军队时，其中有七千多人不愿当兵。原先应募登记的人，也纷纷要求取消登记。
    当然，在反对阿登纳政府重新武装的斗争中，最坚决、最有力的一支力量是德国共产党。
    面对着西德人民反对军国主义化的巨大浪潮，西德统治集团是惊慌的。为了巩固自己的政权，为了扫清重新武装道路上的障碍，西德政府加紧了对和平民主力量的进攻。它首先向德国共产党开刀。
    西德政府对工人阶级进行这一打击的目的，显然是想吓住广大人民，迫使他们驯顺地充当军国主义分子所策划的新战争的炮灰。这一专横行动进一步表明，波恩统治集团妄图沿着一条冒险的道路，走向所谓国家的统一。这表明，西德有人在为战争铺平道路。伴随着军国主义化的推进，西德政权日益走向法西斯化。这两者是孪生兄弟。它们是德国民族利益和和平事业的死敌。无论是德国人民，或者是各国爱好和平的人们，都是不能容忍的。
    全世界的进步力量都支持和同情德国共产党，都坚决反对西德军国主义分子的专横行动。历史证明，德国共产党是取消不了的。共产党代表工人阶级和人民的利益，并且是和平、民主和自由的最坚定的捍卫者。在斗争中成长的德国共产党，必将在今后为争取德意志民族光明的未来的斗争中，更加强自己的力量。
    目前，西德统治集团实行强迫兵役制和取缔共产党等军国主义化和法西斯化的措施，已更清楚地暴露了它自己反人民、反和平的面目。它在国际和国内的地位必将进一步削弱。西德人民正在为保卫和平、民主和自由，为结束西德军国主义者的恐怖统治，展开不屈不挠的斗争，胜利将是属于他们的。
