　　In the Military Reclamation Farm Under the Tianshan Mountains
　　Wu Yingtang

　　The Xinjiang Chepaizi Military Reclamation Farm is located on the western edge of the Junggar Basin. The Tianshan and Altai Mountains stand far away on its two sides like two sea-blue ribbons. To the northeast, it closely adjoins the Gurbantunggut Desert. Not far to the north is the largest oil field in the country, Karamay. The ancient Kuitun River meanders to its southwest. Every year, the melting snow from the Tianshan Mountains converges into a torrent from the large and small valleys, nourishing the farm's land year after year through this ancient river.

　　Chepaizi, like many places north of the Tianshan Mountains, used to be called the "Hungry Prairie," but now it presents a thriving scene. Over the past few years, the soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army, who are engaged in production here, have not only reclaimed a large amount of farmland but also built many new-style buildings such as office residences, schools, hospitals, and factories adapted to the development of production, and installed electric lights. The wide roads from the farm headquarters to the various farming areas are planted with over 100,000 dense forest-like roadside trees and hedgerows, further greening the environment of the farm headquarters center.

　　This farm mainly grows cotton. It has been in existence for six years since its establishment. The cultivated area has grown from 12,000 mu in 1950 to 120,000 mu this year. The management and farming techniques have also improved rapidly. Starting this year, the farm's land has been comprehensively planned and has entered into crop rotation. The farm uses machines for all farming operations. The farm now has more than 40 tractors, combine harvesters, cotton pickers, etc. of various types.

　　The yield of various crops on the farm has been increasing year by year due to the study and promotion of advanced Soviet experience, especially the yield of cotton. In 1954, the farm's 10,000 mu of cotton yielded an average of 431 jin of seed cotton per mu. Although production was reduced last year due to climate influences, the cotton yield still reached more than 356 jin per mu.

　　In the past few years, this farm has handed over a lot of profits to the state every year. Last year alone, they handed over 1.7 million yuan to the state, making it the best of the dozens of state-owned farms in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. This year, they plan to hand over a profit of 3.6 million yuan.

　　This farm has not only achieved great development in agricultural production, but animal husbandry has also developed to a certain extent. The number of various livestock has increased from more than 2,000 in 1950 to more than 17,700 now. In addition to the reclamation area pasture, a mountain pasture has also been established. The development of animal husbandry has produced a large number of wool, meat, leather and other livestock products for the country every year.

　　How did people transform the "Hungry Prairie" into a happy paradise? In order to find the answer, I visited Farm Director Lu Chuansheng, who grew up with this farm and is now leading the youth volunteer reclamation team in building the Second Farm in Suxingtan.

　　Suxingtan Second Farm is more than 20 li away from the old Chepaizi Farm. More than 2,000 young volunteer reclamation team members from Henan are now reclaiming land here. The temporary office location of the new farm is full of dugouts and rows of tents. A large amount of wood is being transported to the construction site. Many machines and materials for reclamation and construction are either piled under the cool sheds or on the open ground.

　　Lu Chuansheng is a thin, tall middle-aged man with a kind face, wearing an old military uniform. During the conversation, he constantly revealed a sense of pride in the land reclamation and production five years ago.

　　"Speaking of the situation when the troops first arrived in Chepaizi for land reclamation and production in 1950, many people on the farm remember that at that time, the ground was covered with tall saxaul trees, willows, and reeds, and there was no road for people to walk at all. The soldiers went out to work during the day and sometimes couldn't find their way back at night. Needless to say, there were no houses prepared for us on the wasteland. The soldiers built saxaul frames and covered them with some grass to live in. Not to mention the food, transportation was difficult, and rice and flour could not be transported, so we often ate whole wheat. In the most difficult times, each person was only allocated a few teacups of water a day. When the soldiers were digging ditches and were too thirsty, they had no choice but to lie on the newly dug wet ground to suck in the cool air, and some ate reed roots to quench their thirst. There were particularly many mosquitoes here in the summer, and the soldiers had to smear their faces with mud to resist the invasion of mosquitoes. However, these difficulties did not scare us.

　　"Many things that happened here at that time were unimaginable. The underground was full of invisible fox dens and rat holes. Many places looked flat, but would sink into large waterlogged areas as soon as they were watered. Sometimes, the channels were just built, and the shadow of the channel could not be seen as soon as water was introduced. It was almost common for the soldiers to use their bodies to block the water.

　　"Under such difficult conditions, in 1950, the 12,000 mu of land harvested grain equivalent to more than 2.59 million jin of wheat.

　　"If we compare the living and working conditions of our production and construction corps in 1950 with the present, it is a huge change. This year, we are going to open up a new farm in Suxingtan, 130,000 mu, all of which will be opened up with tractors. This was simply unimaginable at that time."

　　Speaking of this, he took a blueprint from the table and laid it flat on the ground. This is a planning map of the new Suxingtan Farm. He pointed to it and said to me:

　　"Look, these are one, two, three, four... six work stations, these are crop rotation areas, the circled areas are field protection forest belts, this is the farm headquarters central area, employee dormitories, canteens, schools, post and telecommunications bureau..."

　　I followed his guidance and looked around the entire map, and I immediately felt that what was laid out in front of me was not a design drawing, but a vast farm with fields connected by paths and channels crisscrossing each other. I seemed to be in the center of the farm, seeing the face of Suxingtan becoming extremely beautiful!

　　The people who live between the Tianshan and Altai Mountains, the cause they are creating is great, and their lives are happy. In order to create a happier life, in order to build the Gurbantunggut Desert more beautifully, they are opening up a second new farm with greater labor enthusiasm. At this time next year, people will be able to obtain huge harvests on the newly opened land!

    在天山下的军垦农场里
    吴映堂
    新疆车排子军垦农场位于准噶尔盆地西部边缘，天山和阿尔泰山像两条海蓝色的带子，远远地屹立在它的两边，东北紧紧地接着库尔班通古特沙漠，向北不远就是祖国最大的油田——克拉玛依，古老的奎屯河蜿蜒在它的西南，每年天山积雪溶化，从大小山谷汇成巨流，经过这条古老的河，长年不停地哺育农场的土地。
    车排子这个地方，和天山山脉以北的许多地方一样，过去都被人们称做“饥饿的草原”，但是现在所看到的是一种欣欣向荣的景象。几年来在这里进行生产的人民解放军新疆生产部队战士，不仅开垦了大量耕地，也修建了与发展生产相适应的办公住宅、学校、医院、工厂等许多新式建筑，并且装上了电灯。场部通向各耕作区的宽阔的马路上，栽植了十余万株茂密伐林的行道树和条篱，更加绿化了场部中心的环境。
    这个农场是以植棉为主的，它从建场到现在，已经有六年的历史，耕地面积由1950年的一万二千亩，发展到今年的十二万亩，经营管理、耕作技术，都提高很快。从今年起农场土地经过全面规划后，已经进入轮作。农场进行耕作全部使用机器，现在农场拥有各型拖拉机、联合收割机、采棉机……等四十多台。
    农场各种作物产量，由于学习和推广了苏联先进经验，产量逐年提高，特别是棉花的产量。1954年该场一万亩棉花，每亩平均产籽棉四百三十一斤，去年虽然因气候影响减产，棉花产量每亩仍然达到三百五十六斤以上。
    几年来这个农场每年都给国家上缴很多利润，仅去年一年，他们就给国家上缴了一百七十万元，是新疆生产部队几十个国营农场中最好的一个。今年他们计划可以上缴利润三百六十万元。
    这个农场不仅在农业生产上得到巨大的发展，畜牧业也有一定的发展，各种家畜从1950年的二千多头，到现在已经发展到一万七千七百多头。现在除垦区牧场外，还建立了山区牧场。畜牧业发展，每年又给国家生产了大量的毛、肉、皮各种畜产品。
    人们怎样把“饥饿的草原”改变成幸福的乐园呢？为了寻找这个答案，我曾访问了随着这个农场一同成长起来，现在正领导青年志愿垦荒队，在苏兴滩建设第二农场的路传声场长。
    苏兴滩第二农场，距车排子老场二十余里地，由河南来的两千多青年志愿垦荒队员，现在正在这里开荒。新场临时办公地点尽是地窝子和一排排的帐篷，大批的木料正运到基建工地，许多开荒和建筑用的机器材料，有的堆放在凉棚下，有的堆在空旷地上。
    路传声是一个瘦高个子的中年人，一付和善的面孔，穿着一套旧军服，在谈话中，他不时地流露出对五年前开荒生产的自豪感。
    “提起1950年部队刚到车排子开荒生产的情况，农场里很多人都记得，那时候遍地生长着比人高的索索柴，红柳、芦苇，根本就没有人走的路。战士们白天出去工作，晚上有时候就摸不回来。住的不用说，荒草滩上没有给咱们准备房子，战士们就把索索柴架起，上边盖点草就住下来，吃的更不用说，运输困难，米面运不到，常常吃囫囵麦子，在最困难的时候，吃水每人一天只能分配几茶缸子，战士们在挖渠时渴的没有办法了，就伏在刚挖过的湿地上吸凉气，有的吃芦苇根解渴。夏天这里蚊子特别多，战士们只好脸上糊上稀泥来抵挡蚊子的侵袭。不过这些困难，都没有把咱们吓倒。
    “当时在这里碰到的许多事情是使人想不到的。地下到处是看不见的狐穴鼠洞，很多地看起来平平的，一浇水就陷成大涝坝，有时渠道刚修好，一引水就看不见渠道的影子，战士们用自己的身体堵水，那时几乎是常有的事情了。
    “就在这样困难的条件下，1950年在一万二千亩地上，收获了相当于二百五十九万多斤小麦的粮食。
    “要是拿1950年我们生产部队的生活、工作条件和现在比较，真是天大的变化。今年我们又要在这苏兴滩开辟出一个新农场，十三万亩，全部要用拖拉机开出来，这要是那时候简直就是不可想像的事。”
    说到这里他从桌子上拿过一张蓝图，平平地铺在地上。这是一张苏兴滩新农场的规划图，他用手指着对我说：
    “看，这是一、二、三、四……六个作业站，这些是轮作区，划圆圈的地方都是护田林带，这是场部中心区，职工宿舍、食堂、学校、邮电局……”
    我顺着他指引的方向，在整的图上巡视了一周，立刻使我感到在我面前平铺着的不是一张设计图，而是一个田连阡陌、渠道纵横，辽阔无边的大农场，我仿佛就置身在农场的中心，看到苏兴滩的面貌变得美丽极了！
    生活在天山和阿尔泰山之间的人们，他们所创造的事业是伟大的、他们的生活是幸福的。为了创造更幸福的生活，为了把库尔班通古特沙漠建设得更美丽，他们正以更大的劳动热情，在开辟第二个新农场，明年的这个时候，人们将可以在新开的地上，获得巨大的丰收！
