    Sino-Romanian Men's Basketball Second Friendly Match
    Our "August 1st" Team Wins by One Point
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The Romanian men's basketball team played a friendly match with the "August 1st" men's basketball team at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 24th. The result of the match was 65 to 63, with the Romanian team losing by one point.
    The two sides were evenly matched in this game. After three days of rest, the Romanian players had recovered some of their strength. The outside coordination and attack skills of number 6 Fulbert, number 5 ?Dev, and number 10 Fuldo were somewhat displayed in the game. At the same time, they also used screens to create many shooting opportunities for number 6 and number 10, who are good at mid-range shooting. The deepest impression the Romanian team gave the audience during the game was that they were always steady and controlled the ball, never shooting easily, regardless of winning or losing. At the same time, they were also very effective in preventing the "August 1st" team's fast breaks, retreating faster than before. Therefore, in the first half, the Romanian team led at 5-1, 12-7, and 19-16. The "August 1st" team members also worked very hard in the game and had a strong fighting spirit, so they kept chasing in the first half, tying with the Romanian team nine times, and finally winning by five points with a score of 37-32. However, on the whole, the "August 1st" team members were a bit nervous and not as calm as the Romanian team. In the first half, the two centers, number 19 Yu Yuanxu and number 9 Fan Zhongyu, quickly committed four fouls each, and two other players committed three fouls each; out of 21 free throws, only 11 were made; at the same time, the players' cooperation was not very good, and some players often jumped up for mid-range shots when other players were not prepared, resulting in losing the ball. The second half of the game was even more intense. The "August 1st" team made eight substitutions, and four players committed five fouls each; the Romanian team also made eight substitutions, and three main players committed five fouls each. The Romanian team's reserve strength was weaker. After the main players number 6 and number 10 were fouled out, the offensive power was significantly weakened. The "August 1st" team barely maintained its strength and persevered until the last second.

### 中罗男子篮球二次友谊赛  我“八一”队赢了一个球

    中罗男子篮球二次友谊赛
    我“八一”队赢了一个球
    本报讯　罗马尼亚男子篮球队二十四日晚在北京体育馆同“八一”男子篮球队举行了友谊比赛，比赛结果是六十五比六十三，罗队输了一球。
    这一场比赛双方势均力敌，罗队经过三天的休息以后，队员的体力有些恢复，六号弗尔伯尔特、五号?德夫和十号弗尔多三人的外围配合攻击的特长在比赛中有些发挥，同时他们还利用掩护给中距离投篮能手六号和十号造成许多投篮的机会。罗队在比赛中给观众最深的印象就是无论输赢始终稳扎稳打，控制住球，绝不轻易出手。同时他们在防止“八一”队的快攻方面也很有成效，退守比以前快些。所以上半时罗队曾以五比一、十二比七和十九比十六领先。“八一”队队员在比赛中也很努力，战斗意志很强，所以上半时一直奋起追赶，九次和罗队打成平局，最后反以三十七比三十二赢了五分。但是整个看来，“八一”队队员都有些紧张，不如罗队沉着，上半时两个中锋十九号俞元煦和九号范仲余很快就都四次犯规，另外还有两个队员三次犯规；在二十一次罚球中，只投中了十一次；同时队员的互相配合也不算好，有的队员往往在其他队员没有准备的情况下，在中距离跳起投篮，结果把球丢了。下半时比赛更为紧张，“八一”队八次换人，有四个队员五次犯规；罗队也是八次换人，有三个主力队员五次犯规。罗队的后备力量较差，主力六号和十号罚下以后，进攻力量便显著减弱，“八一”队勉强保存了实力，坚持到最后一秒钟。
