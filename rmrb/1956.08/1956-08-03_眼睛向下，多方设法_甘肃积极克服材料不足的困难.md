Xinhua News Agency Report: Gansu Province Urban Construction Bureau convened a provincial local construction conference from July 25th to 29th. The conference specifically studied the supply of construction materials and the adjustment of labor and transportation capacity for the second half of this year, and determined specific and effective measures.

The Gansu Province Urban Construction Bureau's construction tasks this year have increased by 2.14 times compared to last year, but there is a severe shortage of construction materials. Steel alone is 50% short of the required amount.

In light of this situation, the conference proposed: After scientific research and technical appraisal to ensure project quality, advanced experiences such as cold drawing and cold rolling of steel bars and the substitution of bamboo reinforcement for steel bars should be vigorously and widely promoted. In terms of saving cement, boulder foundations can be used instead of concrete foundations, and lime-sand mortar can be used instead of cement mortar. In general civil buildings, designs can be modified with the consent of the client to change mixed structures to brick-wood structures; some brick-wood structures can also be appropriately changed to earth-wood structures. It is estimated that adopting these methods can save 20% of steel; the 8% cement shortage in the second half of the year can also be resolved.

At the same time, all units must jointly clear warehouses and strengthen material allocation and balance work to share resources. Regarding the shortage of manpower and transportation capacity, construction units are also preparing to take measures of balanced allocation to adjust.

    眼睛向下，多方设法
    甘肃积极克服材料不足的困难
    据新华社讯　甘肃省城市建设局在七月二十五日到二十九日，召开了全省地方建筑施工会议，专门研究了今年下半年的建筑材料供应和劳动力、运输力调整问题，确定了具体有效的措施。
    甘肃省城市建设局今年的施工任务，比去年增加了二点一四倍，但是建筑材料极感缺乏，仅钢筋一项，按需要量计算就缺50％。
    根据这种情况，会议提出：在经过科学研究、技术鉴定，保证工程质量的原则下，要大力广泛推广钢筋冷拉、冷拔和竹筋代替钢筋等先进经验；在节省水泥方面，可以采用块石基础代替混凝土基础和白灰砂浆代替水泥砂浆等。在一般民用建筑方面，征求甲方同意以后，可以修改设计，将混合结构改为砖木结构；有些砖木结构，也可以适当地改为土木结构。采用这些方法以后，估计能节约20％的钢筋；下半年所缺少的8％的水泥，也可以得到解决。
    同时，各单位还要联合清理仓库和加强材料调度平衡工作，以互通有无。关于人力和运输力不足的问题，各施工单位也准备采取平衡调度的办法加以调剂。
