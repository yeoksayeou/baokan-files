    Our Men's Basketball Team Defeats Romania Again Last Night

    (Our Newspaper) News. The Chinese men's basketball team defeated the Romanian men's basketball team with a score of 74 to 65 in a friendly match last night. Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo watched the game. After the game, Premier Zhou Enlai and He Long, Chen Yi and others went to the court to shake hands with the players of both sides and took pictures. When Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with Kukos, a Romanian player who was more than two meters tall, he gestured to praise his imposing physique.

    The Romanian team's tactics last night were mainly to attack through the center. Due to the players' physical recovery, the offense was very fast, and they intercepted our team's ball many times, resulting in fast breaks. Number 6, Fulbert, coordinated with Number 10, Fuldo, to cut in from the end line for layups, which were almost always successful. Our players were calm and steady last night, and the mutual cooperation in setting screens was extremely successful. Number 6, Yang Boyong's mid-range jump shots, were almost always on target. However, our team did not actively launch fast breaks.

    The first half of the game can be described as evenly matched, with the two sides tied five times, and finally our team led 35 to 31. In the second half, due to the Romanian players' many fouls and insufficient reserve strength, our team maintained the advantage; when the final buzzer sounded, our team's Number 9, Liu Erzhu, had already jumped up to shoot a basket. More than 6,000 spectators in the Beijing Gymnasium congratulated our team's victory with warm applause.

    The leader of the Romanian team, Li Teodorescu, told reporters after the game last night: Chinese athletes have good physical strength and a strong belief in victory. He emphasized that the Chinese team's guidance was very successful in leading the game, but regretted that the level of Chinese referees was relatively poor. He hopes that the Chinese team can strengthen the training of defending tall players and adopting full-court press man-to-man tactics in the future, which is very important in international competitions.

    我男子篮球队昨晚又胜罗队
    本报讯　中国男子篮球队昨晚在同罗马尼亚男子篮球队的友谊比赛中，以七十四比六十五取得胜利。国务院总理周恩来，副总理邓小平、贺龙、陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若等都观看了这场球赛。在比赛结束后，周恩来总理和贺龙、陈毅等亲到场内同双方队员一一握手，并照了像。周恩来总理在同罗队身高两公尺以上的运动员库科斯握手时，还用手势表示赞美他的身体的魁伟。
    罗队昨晚的战术主要是通过中锋来进攻，由于队员们体力的恢复，进攻非常迅速，多次拦截到我队的球，打成快攻。六号弗尔伯尔特配合十号弗尔多，从端线切入上篮，几乎每次都成功。昨晚我队员沉着稳重，互相配合打掩护极为成功，六号杨伯镛的中距离跳起投篮，几乎百发百中。但是我队没有积极展开快攻。
    前半时的比赛堪称是势均力敌，旗鼓相当，双方五次打成平局，最后是三十五比三十一，我队领先。后半时由于罗队员犯规次数多，后备力量不足，所以我队一直占优势；当终场锣响时，我队九号刘二柱已在篮下跳起投进一球，北京体育馆内六千多观众用热烈鼓掌祝贺我队得胜。
    罗队领队利·特奥多雷斯库在昨晚比赛后对记者说：中国运动员体力好，有必胜的信心。他强调指出中国队的指导对这场比赛领导得很成功，遗憾的是中国裁判员的水平较差。他希望中国队今后能加强防守高个子和采用全场紧迫人盯人战术的训练，这在国际比赛中是非常重要的。　（甸义）
