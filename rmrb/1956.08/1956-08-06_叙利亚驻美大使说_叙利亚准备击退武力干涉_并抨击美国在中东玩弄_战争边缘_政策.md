Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 5th: Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Farid Zeineddine, announced at a press conference on August 4th that Syria has begun mobilization and is prepared to repel armed intervention with force due to the preparations of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to take military action in the Middle East.

Zeineddine accused the United Kingdom and France of "recklessly moving towards war" and accused the United States of playing a "bargaining With War" policy in the Middle East. He said that although the Secretary of State told us that the United States had not committed itself to a war policy, "actions speak louder than words," and war could involve direct participation by the United States, or indirect participation, such as the United States providing money and helping to assume international obligations.

Zeineddine warned Dulles, saying: "The bargaining With War in the Middle East is very slippery. No matter how vigilant a person in charge is, he may not realize it until he falls into the abyss in the Middle East."

The ambassador firmly pointed out that the Suez Canal is an Egyptian canal built by Egyptians on Egyptian territory, and it is undeniable that Egypt has nationalized it. The reason why the Western powers want to "internationalize" this issue is because of their consideration of colonial interests in the Near East, North Africa, and other regions.

    叙利亚驻美大使说
    叙利亚准备击退武力干涉
    并抨击美国在中东玩弄“战争边缘”政策
    据新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：叙利亚驻美大使法里德·宰尼丁八月四日在记者招待会上宣布，由于英、法、美三国准备在中东采取军事行动，叙利亚已经开始动员，准备以武力击退武力干涉。
    宰尼丁指责英法在“轻率地走向战争”，并且指责美国正在中东玩弄“战争边缘”的政策。他说，虽然国务卿对我们说，美国没有对一种战争政策承担义务，但是“行动比说话更有力”，战争可以是有美国直接参加的，也可以是间接参加的，例如由美国出钱和帮助承担国际义务。
    宰尼丁对杜勒斯提出警告说：“中东的战争边缘是非常滑的。不管一个负责人多么机警，他在中东方面可能要在掉到深渊之后才会发觉。”
    这位大使坚决指出苏彝士运河是埃及人在埃及领土上所修筑的一条埃及运河，埃及将它收归国有是无可非议的。西方三国所以要把这个问题“国际化”，是因为他们在中近东、北非和其他地区的殖民主义利益的考虑。
