    Showing Concern for the Thoughts and Lives of Accounting Personnel in Agricultural Cooperatives
    Pei Guoxun
    Accounting work is an extremely important task in the countryside after agricultural collectivization. However, many accounting personnel are currently not content to do this work. In Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, twenty-seven accountants ran away home or switched professions, and in Xinsheng Township, six accountants proposed to quit. In the Lu'bu District of Yuyao County, some cooperative accountants even feigned madness to achieve their goal of leaving their jobs, not working for days.
    Why are they not content with accounting work? Let's look at a few excerpts from a letter from Shen Zhukui, an accountant at the Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anqiao Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province:
    "At every meeting, the role of the cooperative chairman is always emphasized, while the role of the accountant is hardly mentioned. ... District and township cadres rarely talk about the future of accountants, nor do they care about their political life."
    "Some cooperative cadres not only do not help accountants solve problems in their work, but also take the lead in undermining the accounting system. When they buy things, they don't give the invoices to the accountant, making it impossible for the accountant to record them; when they take money from the custodian, they don't go through the accountant. Some individual cooperative members even make trouble with the accountant unreasonably. When the accountant raises an objection, they say, 'You are just an accountant, not an official!'"
    "The issue of lost workdays for accountants has not been resolved, and they are often worried about their livelihood, but no one cares. When you bring it up, the answer you get is: 'You have to solve it yourself!' How can the accountant solve this problem themselves?"
    "How can accountants be content to work if you don't care about their progress and their lives?"
    Of course, the reasons why accountants are not content with their work are not limited to these. But the issue raised here—how to correctly treat accounting personnel in cooperatives—is indeed worthy of attention. If the Party committees at the county, district, and township levels, in rectifying the financial accounting work of agricultural cooperatives, only pay attention to improving the financial accounting system of agricultural cooperatives, but do not pay attention to the work of winning people over—caring about the progress of accountants and caring about their lives—even if the system is sound, the financial accounting work will still not be done well.
    How should accounting personnel be treated correctly? On the one hand, the Party organizations at the county, district, and township levels should give a correct assessment of the role of accounting personnel in agricultural cooperatives, explain the bright future of accounting personnel from the long-term development prospects of the cooperatives, and care for them politically, helping them to continuously improve their political, cultural, and professional levels, and helping them solve problems in their work. Accountants who have made significant achievements in their work should be given spiritual and material rewards. Accountants who have shortcomings should also be enthusiastically and patiently helped to correct them, and encouraged to continue to move forward. On the other hand, we must care about the living problems of accounting personnel and properly solve their remuneration problems. In addition, we must educate cooperative cadres and members to respect accounting personnel and conscientiously implement the accounting system. Those cooperative cadres and members who do not respect accounting personnel, make unreasonable trouble with accounting personnel, or even undermine the accounting system should be given appropriate criticism and education.

    关心农业社会计人员的思想和生活
    裴国勋
    会计工作是农业合作化以后农村里的一项极其重要的工作；可是，有许多会计人员目前却不安心做这个工作。浙江桐乡县就有二十七个会计逃跑回家或转业，新生乡有六个会计提出不干；余姚县陆埠区有的社会计为了达到离职的目的，甚至装疯卖傻，好几天不工作。
    他们为什么不安心于会计工作呢？让我们看看浙江省萧山县安桥乡新华农业生产合作社的会计沈铸奎来信中的几段话吧：
    “每次会上，总是强调社长的作用，而对会计的作用却几乎没有提到过。……区乡干部对会计的前途很少讲，也不去关心他们的政治生活。”
    “有些社干部不但不帮助会计解决工作中的问题，还带头破坏会计制度。他们经手买了东西，不把发票交给会计，使会计无法记账；向保管员取钱，也不通过会计。个别社员还同会计无理取闹。当会计提出意见时，竟说什么‘你是一个会计呀，又不是当官的！’”
    “会计的误工问题也没有得到解决，常常担心着自己的生活问题，但也没有人过问。当你提出时，得到的答复是：‘你们自己去解决！’叫会计自己怎样解决这个问题呢？”
    “不关心会计的进步，不关心会计的生活，会计怎能会安心工作呢？”
    当然，会计不安心工作的原因，并不止于这些。但这里提出的问题——如何正确地对待合作社会计人员的问题——，的确是值得注意的。如果各地县、区党委在整顿农业社的财务会计工作中，只注意健全农业社的财务会计制度，而不去注意做人的工作——关心会计的进步、关心会计的生活，即使制度健全了，财务会计工作还是不可能做好的。
    应当怎样正确地对待会计人员呢？一方面，县、区、乡的党组织对农业社会计人员的作用要给予正确的估价，从合作社的发展远景来说明会计人员的美好前途，并多从政治上去关心他们，帮助他们不断提高政治、文化、业务水平，帮助他们解决工作中的问题。对于工作有显著成绩的会计人员，应当给予精神和物质奖励。对于有缺点的会计人员，也要热情地耐心地去帮助他们改正，并鼓励他们继续前进。另一方面，要关心会计人员的生活问题，妥善地解决他们的报酬问题。此外，要教育农业社干部和社员尊重会计人员，认真执行会计制度。对于那些不尊重会计人员同会计人员无理取闹甚至破坏会计制度的社干部和社员，要给予适当的批评教育。
