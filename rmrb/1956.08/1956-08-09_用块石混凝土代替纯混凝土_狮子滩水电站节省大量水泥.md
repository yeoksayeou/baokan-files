Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 7th. The Lion Beach Hydropower Station construction project is using rubble concrete to replace pure concrete, saving a large amount of cement. Taking only the dam body of the barrage as an example, more than 6.5 million kilograms of cement were saved in the more than 170,000 cubic meters of rubble concrete poured. Including other manual material costs, a total investment of more than 760,000 yuan was saved.

The engineering quality of using rubble concrete is no lower than that of using pure concrete. The strength and gravity of rubble concrete are greater than that of pure concrete, and the service life can be fully guaranteed.

The rubble concrete used in the Lion Beach Hydropower Station is made by mixing large pieces of rough stone cleared from the foundation of the barrage, tunnels, etc., into the concrete to replace pure concrete. The use of this type of concrete not only saves cement, but also saves gravel and labor costs. The dam body of the Lion Beach Hydropower Station uses an average of 14.8% of rubble per cubic meter of volume. Compared with pure concrete, 37 kilograms of cement are saved, and the unit cost per cubic meter is reduced by 4.437 yuan including other costs.

The technical personnel of the construction department of this hydropower station said that if the pouring method is rearranged reasonably and appropriate equipment is configured, the amount of rubble used can be increased to 20% to 30%, and the cement consumption can be further reduced.

Rubble is a very cheap building material. This type of rubble concrete can be used in projects involving the pouring of large volumes of non-reinforced concrete, such as power station plant foundations, gravity retaining walls, and seaport ports. Now the Lion Beach Hydropower Station has summarized this experience, and the General Bureau of Hydropower Construction of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has instructed all hydropower construction departments across the country to promote this experience.

### 用块石混凝土代替纯混凝土  狮子滩水电站节省大量水泥

    用块石混凝土代替纯混凝土
    狮子滩水电站节省大量水泥
    新华社重庆7日电　狮子滩水电站建设工程采用块石混凝土代替纯混凝土，节约了大量水泥。仅以拦河坝坝体一项工程计算，在所浇制的十七万多立方公尺块石混凝土中，就节约了水泥六百五十多万公斤，加上其他人工材料费在内，共节约投资七十六万多元。
    采用块石混凝土，工程质量并不比用纯混凝土低，块石混凝土的强度和重力都比纯混凝土大，使用年限可以得到充分保证。
    狮子滩水电站采用的块石混凝土是将开挖拦河坝基础、隧洞等清理出来的大块毛石，大量掺用在混凝土中以代替纯混凝土。采用这种混凝土不仅可以节约水泥，还可节省碎石和人工费。狮子滩水电站拦河坝坝体以平均每立方公尺体积掺用14.8％的块石计算，比较纯混凝土就节约水泥三十七公斤，加上其他费用，每立方公尺的单位成本降低了四元三角七分。
    这个水电站施工部门的技术人员说，如果对浇制方法再作合理安排，配置适当设备，块石用量还可以提高到20％到30％，水泥消耗量能进一步降低。
    块石是一种十分廉价的建筑材料。凡是有大体积无钢筋混凝土浇制的工程，如发电站厂房基础、重力挡土墙、海港港口等工程中都可以采用这种块石混凝土。现在狮子滩水电站已经把这项经验总结出来，电力工业部水力发电建设总局指示全国水电建设部门都要推广这项经验。
