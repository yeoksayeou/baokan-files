    Supervisory Post
    Wu Boxiao
    Recently, the Communist Youth League organizations have set up supervisory posts in many departments. This is a brand-new type of work and something that staff in any position should warmly welcome.
    Perhaps some may say, we are in the midst of a high tide of socialist construction, and the vast majority of staff are active, conscientious, and responsible. Do we really need someone to supervise us before we will work hard? Don't underestimate people! Actually, precisely because we are engaged in socialist construction, a great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before, changing with each passing day and constantly developing, lacking both established rules and experience for reference, mistakes and shortcomings are inevitable in our work. The best way to prevent mistakes and overcome shortcomings is self-vigilance and mass supervision. Considering the idea that "the authorities are deluded, while bystanders see clearly," supervision may be even more effective.
    Moreover, those responsible for supervision are young people. Young people generally have vigorous energy, keen senses, and they are brave in advancing and speaking their minds. They are not afraid of this or that, and have no excessive concerns. Furthermore, the organization supervising is the Communist Youth League, a mass organization of advanced youth led by the Party. The supervisory posts set up by the Communist Youth League should be able to exert a huge collective force.
    The supervisory post should be our honest friend in production and work.
    Under the bright eyes of the Communist Youth League's supervisory posts, let right-leaning conservatism and blind adventurism stop; let phenomena such as "eating one's fill all day long and having nothing to occupy one's mind," and carelessness, sloppiness, and numbness disappear; let individualism, bureaucratism, and all bad thoughts and bad work styles be cleaned up! With the eyes of ten people watching and the fingers of ten people pointing, deviations and errors cannot pass unimpeded.
    Of course, the Communist Youth League's supervision will be well-intentioned, will be based on seeking truth from facts, and will convince people with reason. As long as we, in our various positions, abide by the country's policies and social systems, especially the requirements that socialist construction places on us, and wholeheartedly do our work well, the supervisory post will be a driving force to encourage our progress and help us succeed.
    I remember in the past, when revolutionary troops were marching, "motivation sheds" were set up along the way. A song, a few words, and a few slogans made soldiers forget their fatigue and advance bravely on the long journey. So, on the road to advancing towards science, on the road to advancing towards a beautiful socialism, let us also accept the encouragement of our comrades. When our spirits are not very focused, and we are negligent in our work, when we hear the friendly voice from the supervisory post reminding us: "Comrades, keep going!" our marching steps will be more orderly, and our labor enthusiasm will be more vigorous.
    It is fair to say that the supervisory post is the "motivation shed" for soldiers.

    监督岗
    吴伯箫
    最近青年团组织在很多部门设了监督岗。这是一种崭新的工作，是一件值得任何岗位上的工作人员热烈欢迎的事情。
    或者有人会说，我们处在社会主义建设的高潮当中，绝大多数工作人员都是积极的、认真的、富有责任感的，难道还需要有人在旁监督才肯努力么？不要太小看人吧！其实，正因为我们进行的是社会主义建设，是我们的先人从来没有做过的盛事事业，日新月异，不断发展，既没有成规可循，又缺乏经验参考，所以工作中才难免出错误，有缺点。防止错误，克服缺点的最好办法，一是自我警惕，一是群众监督。从“当局者迷，旁观者清”来考虑，监督的办法可能还更有效力。
    何况负责监督的是青年呢？青年，一般有蓬勃的朝气，敏锐的感觉，他们勇于前进，有话就说，他们不会前怕龙，后怕虎，顾虑多端。更何况组织监督的是青年团呢，青年团是党所领导的先进青年的群众组织。青年团设置的监督岗应该能发挥出巨大的集体力量。
    监督岗应当是我们生产和工作上的畏友。
    在青年团监督岗雪亮的眼睛底下，让右倾保守、盲目冒进停止吧，让“饱食终日，无所用心”和粗枝大叶、疲蹋麻痹等现象匿迹消踪吧，让个人主义、官僚主义等一切坏思想、坏作风都收拾起来吧！十目所视，十手所指，偏差错误就不能通行无阻了。
    当然，青年团的监督会是与人为善的，会是实事求是，以理服人的。只要我们在各种岗位上，遵照国家的政策，社会的制度，特别是社会主义建设对我们所提出的要求，全心全意地把工作做好，监督岗会是激励我们进步，帮助我们成功的一种动力。
    记得过去革命队伍行军，沿途设“鼓动棚”，一个歌，一段话，几声口号曾使长途跋涉的战士忘记疲劳，奋勇前进；那么，在向科学进军的路上，在向美好的社会主义进军的路上，也接受同志们的鞭策吧。当我们精神不太集中，万一工作上有疏忽的时候，听到监督岗上亲切的声音在提醒我们：“同志们，加油！”我们前进的步伐会更整齐，我们劳动的热情会更旺盛的。
    无妨说，监督岗就是战士的“鼓动棚”。
