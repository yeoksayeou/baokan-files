　　American Soldiers' Entertainment
　　Not long ago, in the city of Ti'an, near Saigon, several American soldiers were drinking and making merry in a bar. Suddenly, another American soldier rushed in and immediately opened fire on them, killing one person on the spot and injuring two others. Subsequently, this American soldier fled the bar, broke into the residence of a local resident, jumped from the upper floor, smashed his head and died.
　　The Geneva Accords stipulate that South Vietnam is closed to the entry of foreign military personnel. But American soldiers can openly make trouble there.

    美国兵的娱乐
    不久前，在西贡附近的堤岸市，有几个美国兵在一间酒巴间内饮酒作乐。忽然，又一个美国兵闯了进来，立即对准他们开了几枪，其中一人当场毙命，另外两个也受伤。随后，这个美国兵又逃出酒巴间，闯进一家当地居民的住宅，从楼上跳下来，摔碎脑袋身死。
    日内瓦协定规定，南越是禁止外国军事人员入境的。但美国军人却公然可以在那里胡闹。
