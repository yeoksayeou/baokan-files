    Talking about "Crude"
    Feng Ming
    Once criticism is labeled with the word "crude," it's as if a rat crosses the street, and everyone can shout to kill it.
    However, the criticism that accuses others of "crude" criticism is often a case of "one size fits all," or even simpler. Perhaps this is a case of "using his own methods against him," but it's not necessarily a good approach.
    Crude criticism is not terrible. What is terrible is letting crudeness dominate and become the standard.
    In the past, there seemed to be a trend in the literary and art circles where praise was all praise, and criticism was all criticism. This was probably not a normal trend. Now that there are clashes of different opinions, even if some opinions are biased, some words are too strong or inappropriate, and some tones are not very calm, if it is not full of nonsense and is still reasonable, then "stones from other hills can polish jade." It is always good to let these opinions see the light of day and be discussed.
    Of course, crudeness is wrong, and cold words hurt people. Critics should take this as a major warning. However, those who are criticized, or those who speak up for the criticized, should not frown upon seeing overly strong words like "slander" or "distortion" and dismiss them with the word "crude," without considering whether there are any reasonable elements within them. Attitude and tolerance, after all, are secondary.
    Otherwise, what should we do? Fifty degrees lukewarm is not good; if we are sharper, the words may not be cautious enough, and we will be accused of crudeness. Before writing, we are full of worries, trembling with fear, so we might as well put down the pen and remain silent. However, cold indifference is even more terrifying.

### 谈“粗暴”

    谈“粗暴”
    冯明
    批评一被冠上“粗暴”二字，那就大有老鼠过街，人人可以喊打之势。
    然而给批评加上“粗暴”罪名的批评，常常也是“一棍子打死”，甚至来得更简单的。这也许是“即以其人之道，还治其人之身”吧，但不见得是好办法。
    粗暴的批评并不可怕。可怕的是让粗暴称霸，定于一尊。
    从前，文艺界似乎有一种风气，说好全是说好，说坏全是说坏，这恐怕不能算作正常的风气。现在有了不同意见的交锋，纵然有些意见失之于偏颇，有些字眼用得过重或不当，有些语气不很冷静，但倘如不是满篇胡话，还能言之成理，那末“他山之石，可以攻玉”，让这些意见见见天日，展开讨论，总是好的。
    当然，粗暴不对，冷语伤人，在批评者，应引为大戒；但在被批评者或为被批评者打抱不平的人，也不必一见分量过重的字眼，如“诽谤”“歪曲”之类，就皱起眉头，不问其中是否有些合理的成分，而以“粗暴”二字一棍子打杀。态度和气量等等，毕竟是次要的。
    不然怎么办呢？五十度微温不好，尖锐一点吧，话说得不够慎重，又有粗暴之咎，下笔之前顾虑重重，战战兢兢，索性就不如搁笔不写，缄口不言。然而冷淡的默杀，却是更可怕的。
