Recently, the editorial department has received letters from readers reflecting confusion in the work of establishing mail carriers in agricultural production cooperatives. Some people think the mail carrier system is very good and should be universally established; not establishing it is right-leaning conservatism. Some people think that although the mail carrier system is good, it is only suitable for Soviet collective farms. China's agricultural production cooperatives should run the cooperatives frugally, and should not establish them at all; establishing them is blind and rash. This has left comrades doing specific work at the grassroots level at a loss, and they have had to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. Those that have not been established have been temporarily suspended; those that have been established have been left unattended. Rural postal work has fallen into chaos, and no one is responsible for the remuneration of the mail carriers who have already been appointed. When they go to the agricultural cooperative, the cooperative says: "Now we need to run the cooperative frugally, this is a non-productive expense, the cooperative cannot pay, go to the post office!" When they go to the post office, the post office says: "There are no instructions from above, we cannot solve it, let's handle it according to the contract, go to the cooperative to solve it!" Pushed back and forth like this, some mail carriers are even having trouble with food and clothing.

What should we do? Should agricultural production cooperatives establish mail carriers? I think they should be established. China has a vast territory, and residents are scattered. Post offices have limited manpower, and in many areas, mail below the township level cannot be delivered directly to the recipients by the post office. It can only be forwarded by people who go to the township for meetings or market days, which not only often results in the accumulation of mail and newspapers, but also often leads to losses. After the establishment of mail carriers, not only are these drawbacks eliminated, but also the farmers' time, often wasted going to post offices dozens of miles away to send and receive letters and newspapers, is greatly saved. For example, in Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhao Jiawopu Township, Kangping County, Liaoning Province, before the establishment of a mail carrier, farmers throughout the township spent more than 900 labor days a year sending and receiving mail, while a mail carrier only used more than 290 labor days, saving more than 600 labor days a year. Therefore, it is wrong to think that this system is only applicable to Soviet collective farms and to ignore the urgent need of Chinese farmers to improve rural postal work.

However, it cannot be thought that since the mail carrier system is very good, it should be universally promoted all at once. At present, many agricultural production cooperatives have not been established for long, and their foundations are still relatively weak. Excessive non-productive expenditures will inevitably reduce farmers' income. In the past, there was a period when there was indeed a tendency for impatience and rashness in the development of mail carriers in agricultural production cooperatives. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications once proposed that mail carriers should be established in a planned and step-by-step manner. One person could be set up for one township and one cooperative, and one person could be jointly set up for several cooperatives in one township. However, in actual implementation, some places set up mail carriers regardless of the size of the cooperative. At a symposium of post office directors from 22 counties convened by the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in March this year, some people also believed that: "It will take a maximum of two or three months to universally establish mail carriers in the county." A county in Henan Province once notified all townships to establish mail carriers within five days, and sixteen townships in Xin County, Shanxi Province, set up forty mail carriers. Some places even demanded that mail carriers be equipped with raincoats, bicycles, and mailbags. This kind of unrealistic and greedy approach caused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, although the mail carrier system is very good, it is also wrong to demand that it be universally established all at once.

So, what should we do? Different methods should be adopted according to the different circumstances of different regions. In some areas, agricultural production cooperatives were established earlier, the economic situation is relatively good, and there is more mail, so the burden on the masses to establish mail carriers is not great, and the masses have such a demand, so mail carriers can be established. In some areas, agricultural production cooperatives were established later, the economic situation is not very good, and there are not many newspapers and mail, so the masses cannot afford to establish mail carriers, so mail carriers can be temporarily not established, or several agricultural production cooperatives can jointly set up one mail carrier, or a mail carrier can be set up separately, but other methods can be found to solve the issue of remuneration. In short, this work should be done in consultation with the masses based on the specific situation. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee decided, based on the specific situation in Liaoning, to continue to establish mail carriers, while canceling the township correspondents, and decided that mail carriers generally should not be equipped with raincoats and bicycles. This decision not only meets the farmers' need for convenient communication, but also reduces the burden on the farmers, and is welcomed by the masses. All localities can actively and proactively solve the problem of establishing mail carriers based on their local conditions, and overcome the current chaos in rural postal work.

    农业社要不要设立邮递员
    杨汉义
    最近，编辑部收到一些读者来信，反映在建立农业生产合作社邮递员工作中存在着混乱现象。有些人认为邮递员制度很好，应该普遍建立；不建立就是右倾保守。有些人认为邮递员制度虽然好，但只适合于苏联的集体农庄，我国农业生产合作社要勤俭办社，一律不应该建立；建立了就是盲目冒进。弄得下面做具体工作的同志无所适从，只得采取“观望”态度。没有建立的，暂时停止了；已经建立的也撇开不管了。农村邮递工作陷于混乱状态，已经设立了的邮递员的报酬，也无人负责。找农业社，社里说：“现在要勤俭办社，这是非生产性开支，社里不能出，找邮局吧！”到邮局，局里说：“上边没有指示，我们不能解决，还是按合同办事，找社里解决吧！”这样推来推去，有些邮递员连穿衣吃饭都成了问题。
    怎么办呢？农业生产合作社邮递员应不应该建立？我认为是应该建立的。我国地区辽阔，居民点分散，邮局人力有限，许多地区乡以下的邮件，邮局不可能直接送到收件人手中，只得靠到乡里开会或赶集的人捎转，不但经常积压邮件、报刊，而且经常有丢失的现象。设立邮递员以后，不但免除了这些流弊，而且还大大节省了农民常因到几十里以外的邮局寄取信件、报纸而浪费的时间。比如辽宁省康平县赵家窝铺乡燎原农业生产合作社，在没有建立邮递员以前，全乡农民因寄取邮件一年要花九百多个劳动日，而一个邮递员只用二百九十多个劳动日就够了，一年就节省六百多个劳动日。因此，认为这个制度只适用于苏联的集体农庄，而忽视我国农民对于改善农村邮递工作的迫切需要是不对的。
    但是，并不能认为邮递员制度既然很好，就应该一下子普遍推广起来。目前，许多农业生产合作社建立不久，基础还比较薄弱，非生产性开支过多了势必减少农民的收入。过去有一个时期，在发展农业生产合作社邮递员工作中，确实有急躁冒进的倾向，邮电部曾经提出要有计划、有步骤地建立邮递员，一乡一社的可以单设一人，一乡数社的可以联合设立一人；但实际执行中有的地方不分大社小社都设立了邮递员。在今年三月邮电部邮政总局召集的二十二个县的邮政局长座谈会上，也曾有人认为：“要在全县普遍建立邮递员，最多只要两三个月的时间”，河南省有一个县曾通知各乡在五天内全部建立邮递员，山西省忻县十六个乡就设了四十个邮递员，有的地方甚至要求给邮递员配备雨衣，自行车，邮袋，这种不切合实际要求和贪多贪快的做法，引起群众普遍不满。因此，邮递员制度虽然很好，但要求一下子都普遍建立起来也是不对的。
    那么，应该怎么办呢？应该根据不同地区的不同情况来采取不同的办法。有些地区农业生产合作社建立得比较早，经济情况比较好，通往邮件也比较多，建立邮递员群众负担并不大，群众也有这样的要求，就可以设立邮递员。有些地区农业生产合作社建立得比较晚、经济情况还不很好，通往的报刊和邮件也不多，设立邮递员群众负担不起，就可以暂时不设立邮递员，或者几个农业生产合作社合设一个邮递员，或者单独设立邮递员，但报酬问题想别的办法来解决。总之，这件工作应该根据具体情况，同群众商量着办。最近，中共辽宁省委会和辽宁省人民委员会根据辽宁的具体情况，决定继续设立邮递员，同时取消乡里的通讯员，并决定一般不给邮递员配备雨衣、自行车。这个决定既满足了农民便利通信的要求，也减轻了农民的负担，受到群众的欢迎。各个地方都可以根据当地的具体情况，积极主动地解决设立邮递员的问题，克服目前农村邮递工作中的混乱现象。
