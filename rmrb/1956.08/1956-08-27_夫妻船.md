    Husband and Wife Boat
    Liu Xun
    On the sea around the South China Sea and the coast of Fujian, there float many "husband and wife boats."

    These are small fishing boats, less than two fathoms long and no more than seven feet wide, with only one mast. The boats are equipped with stoves, fresh water tanks, firewood, rice, oil, salt, and a complete set of production and living utensils, and inhabited by a family.

    With a small sail hoisted, the "husband and wife boats" are wandering boats. The boats drift on the ocean, day and night. Everything on board must be subordinate to fishing production, and all production activities must be subordinate to the tides. They ride the tides to conquer the sea, and ride the tides to return to port. They emit cooking smoke, carrying songs and laughter, embellishing the scenery like exquisite paintings on the clear, windless sea. If the beautiful South China Sea flower, Gulangyu Island, has ten points of beauty, three points should be given to these white sails.

    The small "husband and wife boat" is like a tireless seagull. How many storms and waves has it weathered, how many days and nights of wind and rain. On the storm-swept sea, the wife gives birth in the cabin. The cabin is so low and narrow that a man over six feet tall can only sleep curled up, but this is a home, and a delivery room. In this waterborne family, the first child grows up, the second child can help row the boat, and the third child is not yet grown and only plays, and should be tied to the bow with a rope like an ox. Why tie him up? The mother answers with painful memories: Once, during a bountiful harvest season, the whole family was busy catching fish, and when they looked back, the child had rolled into the sea, and in the blink of an eye, the child was gone.

    Drifting, drifting, they live and die on the ocean for generations, sons and grandsons. During the peak fishing season, they sing: "Poor at three o'clock, rich at four o'clock, build a big house at five o'clock." But in the old society, they suffered from layers of exploitation, they never built a big house, nor did they have an inch of land on land to build a small house. They have no hometown registration; the boat is their hometown registration.

    Children are born on the boat and grow up on the boat. When grown-up girls, according to the unique custom of "husband and wife boats," tie a red band on their hair with bright red cloth and get married, this red band is then taken off. When grown-up sons are about to get married, the parents exchange the money they have saved for many years for a boat. They carefully compare the old boat and the new boat, choosing the sturdiest one to give to the married son. Thus, drifting on the sea, another "husband and wife boat" is added.

    The "husband and wife boat" drifts, it does not care about north, south, east, or west, only where there are fish. It has no home, but everywhere is home. Where they stay for a long time, that place is almost their home. According to a statistic in Gulangyu in the spring of 1956 alone, there were more than seventy "husband and wife boats" "living" there. The small husband and wife boats, drifted through one dynasty after another, and finally, in the singing of the People's Liberation Army march, they got rid of the layers of exploitation and extortion by fish bullies and entered a new era and a new society. In recent years, they have been organized, and the water police station and the fisheries bureau are responsible for their lives. However, the large fishing grounds that can be fully loaded are on the other side of the enemy-occupied island of Kinmen. To get there, they must pass through the maritime blockade line. The enemy's artillery fire and patrol boats often kill or kidnap their companions. Under the threat of the enemy situation, marine production has been greatly restricted. It should be said that their lives are not good now, but the prospect of a better life is encouraging them. The first large ship of the fishery production cooperative has set sail, and it is said that production by "husband and wife boats" will soon become a thing of the past.

    Drifting, drifting, individual "husband and wife boats" sometimes even drift to the East China Sea. They see that the fishermen in Ant Island, Longdong, and Shenjiamen live so well: the painted bed frames are inlaid with shells, and the loudspeaker broadcasts music and news three times a day. The production situation on the East China Sea is often transmitted to the South China Sea. The husbands and wives on the "husband and wife boats" are so eager to liberate Taiwan in any way possible, so that they can produce peacefully as soon as possible.

    夫妻船
    柳?
    在南海、福建沿海一带海面上，漂游着许许多多“夫妻船”。
    这是长不足两丈，宽不过七尺，只有一条桅杆的小渔船，船上装着锅灶、淡水罐、柴米油盐和全套的生产生活用具，住着一家人。
    挂着一支小帆的“夫妻船”，它们是流浪船。船在海洋上漂游着，无日无夜。船上的一切要服从捕鱼生产，一切生产行动又要服从海潮。它乘着海潮远征大海，又乘着海潮归返港湾。它冒着炊烟，载着歌声和欢笑，在晴明无风的海上，绝妙如画地点缀了风光。美丽的南海之花鼓浪屿，假如有十分姿色，三色姿色应分给这些朵朵白帆。
    小小的“夫妻船”，像是一只不知疲倦的海鸥。它踏过多少惊涛骇浪，度过多少风风雨雨的白天黑夜呵。在风雨连宵的海面上，妻子在舱内生孩子了。船舱是那样低矮狭小，身长六尺以上的汉子，只能蜷曲着睡觉，可是这是个家庭，又是个产室呵。在这个水上家庭里，第一个孩子长大了，第二个孩子可帮助摇橹了，第三个还未长大，只管玩耍的孩子，只宜老牛般地用条绳子拴在船头。为什么要拴住他？母亲用伤痛的回忆回答说：有一回，在丰收的季节里，全家人只顾捞鱼，猛回头，孩子已滚落大海，霎眼时间，孩子已无影无踪了。
    漂呵，漂呵，他们世世代代，子子孙孙，生生死死，都在海洋上。在渔汛旺盛季节，他们唱：“三更穷，四更富，五更盖大屋”。可是在旧社会，他们受着层层剥削，他们从没有盖过大屋，陆上也从没有可以兴盖小屋的一寸土，他们没有家乡籍贯，船就是家乡籍贯。
    儿女在船上生，又在船上长大了。长大起来的姑娘，按照“夫妻船”的特有习俗，用鲜红的采布在发上扎了个红箍，出嫁了，这个红箍就解下了。长大了的儿子该结婚了，父母就将多年积下的钱，换来一条船，老船和新船仔细比较过，拣着结结实实的那条，送给婚娶了的儿子，于是，在大海上漂啊，漂啊，又多了一条“夫妻船”。
    “夫妻船”漂游着，它不管南北东西，只管那里有没有鱼。它没有家，却到处是家，它们在那里停泊久了，那里也差不多就是他们的家了。1956年春就鼓浪屿一处的统计，那里“住着”七十多户“夫妻船”，小小的夫妻船，漂过了一个朝代又一个朝代，终于在解放军进行曲的歌声中，摆脱了鱼伢子鱼霸的层层剥削敲诈，进入新的时代新的社会来了。近年来，他们组织起来了，有水上派出所和水产局对他们的生活负责了。可是，那个可以满载而归的大渔场，是在敌占岛屿金门的那边。到那边，要通过海上封锁线。敌方的炮火和巡逻船，时常打死或掳去他们的伙伴。在敌情威胁下，海上生产受到了很大的限制。应该说，他们现在的生活并不好，可是美好生活的前景却在鼓舞着他们。渔业生产合作社的第一支大船出海了，据说用“夫妻船”生产也将很快成为过去。
    漂啊，漂啊，个别的“夫妻船”有时竟漂到东海海面上来。他们看见蚂蚁岛、龙洞、沈家门一带的渔家，生活过得那样好：油漆了的床架上还镶着贝壳，播音器一日三次播送着乐曲和消息。东海面上的生产情况，时常传到南海面上来。“夫妻船”上的夫妻们，为能和和平平地生产，他们多么希望以任何方式早日解放台湾啊。
