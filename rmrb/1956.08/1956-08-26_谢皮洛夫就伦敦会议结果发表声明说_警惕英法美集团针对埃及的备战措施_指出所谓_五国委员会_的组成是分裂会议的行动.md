Xinhua News Agency, London, August 25th: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov held a press conference in London on August 24th and issued a statement on the results of the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue.

Shepilov pointed out that the London Conference began its work under circumstances where certain individuals in Britain and France artificially created a tense and uneasy atmosphere surrounding Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. Moreover, in order to exert pressure on Egypt, unreasonable economic sanctions were imposed on Egypt, and military preparations were recklessly undertaken against Egypt in violation of the UN Charter.

		The Arrangement of the Conference Was Made with Ulterior Motives

Shepilov said that the governments of many countries, including the Soviet government, have justly pointed out that the selection of conference members was made with ulterior motives: only twenty-four out of fifty countries that use the Suez Canal were invited to participate in the conference, and most of them are participants in aggressive military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

At the same time, everything was prepared during the preparation process of the conference to exclude the possibility of Egypt participating in the London Conference on an equal footing.

The formulated conference procedures also clearly demonstrated that the initiating countries of this conference wanted the carefully selected conference members to accept pre-prepared measures and principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue, so as to freely take further action under the guise of the conference's resolutions. Moreover, although more than twenty countries with a stake in the smooth flow of the canal were not present, and although Egypt was not present, some people even suggested that the conference adopt a procedure of passing decisions by a simple majority; suggested that the conference chairman be given great power over the conference; suggested limiting the speaking time and number of times representatives of participating countries could speak, and so on. All of this proves that some people are attempting to overturn or limit the recognized democratic principles that must be observed for such conferences in order to fulfill the tasks proposed in advance by the organizers of the conference. Needless to say, many countries' delegations could not agree to such a plan that undermines recognized norms. As a result, the proposed procedures and agenda were not adopted. This was the first failure of the conference initiators.

		A Clash of Two Different Lines

Shepilov then talked about some of the most important aspects of the Suez Canal issue discussed at the London Conference. He said: The London Conference was mainly a clash of two completely different lines. It was a conflict between two completely different principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue. One line is reflected in the proposal put forward by India and supported by Indonesia, Ceylon, and the Soviet Union; the other line is reflected in the well-known American proposal, the so-called "Dulles Plan."

The essence of the Indian proposal is to proceed from the principle of recognizing and respecting Egypt's national sovereignty, and it believes that Egypt, as the owner of the Suez Canal, should exercise the function of managing the canal. At the same time, it also stipulates certain principles that correctly combine the interests of Egypt as a sovereign state and the interests of the countries using the canal. The Soviet delegation agreed with India's plan and also expressed a series of its own specific views, especially regarding what form of international cooperation it believes can enable the Suez Canal to function normally as a free and open waterway, benefiting world trade and in line with Egypt's interests, while respecting Egyptian sovereignty.

The plan submitted by the American delegation to the conference stipulated depriving the Egyptian government of the management and sovereignty of the Suez Canal and establishing a foreign management agency for the Suez Canal, and even taking "effective sanctions" to support any actions that obstruct Egypt's management of the canal. The international organization for managing the Suez Canal stipulated in the American plan is a "state within a state" in Egypt. This is to establish some form of colonial system in Egypt. The American plan also abandons the principle of negotiating with Egypt as an equal and sovereign state. This plan is incompatible with the spirit of our times and with the supreme principles and purposes of the United Nations.

What was actually discussed at the London Conference was how to treat Egypt, that is, whether to treat it as an independent, sovereign, and equal country, a member of the United Nations, and the full master of its own country, or to openly trample on the norms of international law, the principles and purposes of the United Nations, and Egypt's legitimate rights and sovereignty. In other words, the conference was discussing whether to recognize or not to recognize the most important principle of the freedom and independence of all peoples, and discussing the principle of sovereignty that is put into concrete action rather than mentioned formally in words.

Shepilov emphasized that the Soviet Union fully knows the importance of freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal for many countries, especially for Britain and France. As a maritime power engaged in extensive international trade, the Soviet Union has a direct interest in the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal and other waterways shared by the Soviet Union with other countries. The necessity of ensuring freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal is absolutely undeniable, but this issue must never be resolved by infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty, but should be combined with it, and the Indian plan provides for this combination.

		The Attempt to Promote the "Dulles Plan" Did Not Succeed

Shepilov elaborated on the conspiracy of the initiating countries of the London Conference to force Egypt to accept the so-called "Dulles Plan" in the name of the conference in the last two days of the conference. He said that despite the many obstacles set by the initiating countries of the conference to prevent the representatives of countries striving for a fair and reasonable solution to the Suez issue from stating their views, the attempt by the representatives of major colonial countries to use this conference to issue a humiliating ultimatum to Egypt in the name of an international conference still did not succeed. The London Conference finally passed only one decision: to entrust the chairman of the conference to hand over the entire record of the London Conference to the Egyptian government.

Shepilov pointed out that it is not true that some newspapers reported that the conference finally entrusted representatives of five countries, including Australia, to hand over the plan proposed by the United States at the conference to the Egyptian government. The conference did not pass such a resolution.

Shepilov said that at the final stage of the conference, the Soviet delegation proposed to pass a short communiqu√© signed by all countries, in which those principles for a peaceful and just resolution of the Suez Canal issue could be clarified, which would facilitate all countries participating in the conference to jointly study such an issue with the Egyptian government: resolving the issue of freedom of navigation on the canal while respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity and respecting the interests of other countries using the canal.

However, some people wanted to split the conference in order to make demands on Egypt beyond the scope of the conference based on the "Dulles Plan." Due to these divisive actions, the so-called "Five-Nation Committee" was formed outside the scope of the conference.

The intention to split the conference and the establishment of some kind of group outside the scope of the conference in order to make demands on Egypt is the result of the moral and political failure at the London Conference of those forces who hope to sharpen the Suez issue and advocate that the Suez issue be resolved based on a position of strength in order to force Egypt to accept certain colonialist conditions and demands.

Shepilov pointed out that there was no united group of seventeen or eighteen countries at the London Conference that unconditionally endorsed the principles of the "Dulles Plan." During the discussion, representatives of Denmark, Norway, Iran, Spain, Japan, and some other countries pointed out that their governments believed that the only possible way to resolve the Suez issue was through peaceful means, by negotiating with Egypt as a sovereign country. They raised many reservations and opinions.

		The Propositions of the Soviet Union, India, and Other Countries Will Receive Widespread Response

The peace-loving and democratic attitude towards resolving the canal issue reflected in the Indian proposal and the speeches of the representatives of Indonesia, Ceylon, India, and the Soviet Union at the London Conference will receive enthusiastic responses from millions of people in the East and the West.

Finally, Shepilov pointed out the seriousness of the situation that may be caused by the intensified activities of the groups in Britain, France, and the United States who advocate resolving the Suez issue from a position of strength, and reminded everyone to be vigilant against the international disputes that these groups may cause. He said: The war preparations taken by certain countries against Egypt are an open and intolerable provocation against the freedom-loving people of Egypt, against the people of Eastern countries striving for national independence and sovereignty, and against peace. We believe it is our duty to reiterate this warning today.
