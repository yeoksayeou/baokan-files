Xinhua News Agency, London, August 25th: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov held a press conference in London on August 24th and issued a statement on the results of the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue.

Shepilov pointed out that the London Conference began its work under circumstances where certain individuals in Britain and France artificially created a tense and uneasy atmosphere surrounding Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. Moreover, in order to exert pressure on Egypt, unreasonable economic sanctions were imposed on Egypt, and military preparations were recklessly undertaken against Egypt in violation of the UN Charter.

		The Arrangement of the Conference Was Made with Ulterior Motives

Shepilov said that the governments of many countries, including the Soviet government, have justly pointed out that the selection of conference members was made with ulterior motives: only twenty-four out of fifty countries that use the Suez Canal were invited to participate in the conference, and most of them are participants in aggressive military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

At the same time, everything was prepared during the preparation process of the conference to exclude the possibility of Egypt participating in the London Conference on an equal footing.

The formulated conference procedures also clearly demonstrated that the initiating countries of this conference wanted the carefully selected conference members to accept pre-prepared measures and principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue, so as to freely take further action under the guise of the conference's resolutions. Moreover, although more than twenty countries with a stake in the smooth flow of the canal were not present, and although Egypt was not present, some people even suggested that the conference adopt a procedure of passing decisions by a simple majority; suggested that the conference chairman be given great power over the conference; suggested limiting the speaking time and number of times representatives of participating countries could speak, and so on. All of this proves that some people are attempting to overturn or limit the recognized democratic principles that must be observed for such conferences in order to fulfill the tasks proposed in advance by the organizers of the conference. Needless to say, many countries' delegations could not agree to such a plan that undermines recognized norms. As a result, the proposed procedures and agenda were not adopted. This was the first failure of the conference initiators.

		A Clash of Two Different Lines

Shepilov then talked about some of the most important aspects of the Suez Canal issue discussed at the London Conference. He said: The London Conference was mainly a clash of two completely different lines. It was a conflict between two completely different principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue. One line is reflected in the proposal put forward by India and supported by Indonesia, Ceylon, and the Soviet Union; the other line is reflected in the well-known American proposal, the so-called "Dulles Plan."

The essence of the Indian proposal is to proceed from the principle of recognizing and respecting Egypt's national sovereignty, and it believes that Egypt, as the owner of the Suez Canal, should exercise the function of managing the canal. At the same time, it also stipulates certain principles that correctly combine the interests of Egypt as a sovereign state and the interests of the countries using the canal. The Soviet delegation agreed with India's plan and also expressed a series of its own specific views, especially regarding what form of international cooperation it believes can enable the Suez Canal to function normally as a free and open waterway, benefiting world trade and in line with Egypt's interests, while respecting Egyptian sovereignty.

The plan submitted by the American delegation to the conference stipulated depriving the Egyptian government of the management and sovereignty of the Suez Canal and establishing a foreign management agency for the Suez Canal, and even taking "effective sanctions" to support any actions that obstruct Egypt's management of the canal. The international organization for managing the Suez Canal stipulated in the American plan is a "state within a state" in Egypt. This is to establish some form of colonial system in Egypt. The American plan also abandons the principle of negotiating with Egypt as an equal and sovereign state. This plan is incompatible with the spirit of our times and with the supreme principles and purposes of the United Nations.

What was actually discussed at the London Conference was how to treat Egypt, that is, whether to treat it as an independent, sovereign, and equal country, a member of the United Nations, and the full master of its own country, or to openly trample on the norms of international law, the principles and purposes of the United Nations, and Egypt's legitimate rights and sovereignty. In other words, the conference was discussing whether to recognize or not to recognize the most important principle of the freedom and independence of all peoples, and discussing the principle of sovereignty that is put into concrete action rather than mentioned formally in words.

Shepilov emphasized that the Soviet Union fully knows the importance of freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal for many countries, especially for Britain and France. As a maritime power engaged in extensive international trade, the Soviet Union has a direct interest in the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal and other waterways shared by the Soviet Union with other countries. The necessity of ensuring freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal is absolutely undeniable, but this issue must never be resolved by infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty, but should be combined with it, and the Indian plan provides for this combination.

		The Attempt to Promote the "Dulles Plan" Did Not Succeed

Shepilov elaborated on the conspiracy of the initiating countries of the London Conference to force Egypt to accept the so-called "Dulles Plan" in the name of the conference in the last two days of the conference. He said that despite the many obstacles set by the initiating countries of the conference to prevent the representatives of countries striving for a fair and reasonable solution to the Suez issue from stating their views, the attempt by the representatives of major colonial countries to use this conference to issue a humiliating ultimatum to Egypt in the name of an international conference still did not succeed. The London Conference finally passed only one decision: to entrust the chairman of the conference to hand over the entire record of the London Conference to the Egyptian government.

Shepilov pointed out that it is not true that some newspapers reported that the conference finally entrusted representatives of five countries, including Australia, to hand over the plan proposed by the United States at the conference to the Egyptian government. The conference did not pass such a resolution.

Shepilov said that at the final stage of the conference, the Soviet delegation proposed to pass a short communiqué signed by all countries, in which those principles for a peaceful and just resolution of the Suez Canal issue could be clarified, which would facilitate all countries participating in the conference to jointly study such an issue with the Egyptian government: resolving the issue of freedom of navigation on the canal while respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity and respecting the interests of other countries using the canal.

However, some people wanted to split the conference in order to make demands on Egypt beyond the scope of the conference based on the "Dulles Plan." Due to these divisive actions, the so-called "Five-Nation Committee" was formed outside the scope of the conference.

The intention to split the conference and the establishment of some kind of group outside the scope of the conference in order to make demands on Egypt is the result of the moral and political failure at the London Conference of those forces who hope to sharpen the Suez issue and advocate that the Suez issue be resolved based on a position of strength in order to force Egypt to accept certain colonialist conditions and demands.

Shepilov pointed out that there was no united group of seventeen or eighteen countries at the London Conference that unconditionally endorsed the principles of the "Dulles Plan." During the discussion, representatives of Denmark, Norway, Iran, Spain, Japan, and some other countries pointed out that their governments believed that the only possible way to resolve the Suez issue was through peaceful means, by negotiating with Egypt as a sovereign country. They raised many reservations and opinions.

		The Propositions of the Soviet Union, India, and Other Countries Will Receive Widespread Response

The peace-loving and democratic attitude towards resolving the canal issue reflected in the Indian proposal and the speeches of the representatives of Indonesia, Ceylon, India, and the Soviet Union at the London Conference will receive enthusiastic responses from millions of people in the East and the West.

Finally, Shepilov pointed out the seriousness of the situation that may be caused by the intensified activities of the groups in Britain, France, and the United States who advocate resolving the Suez issue from a position of strength, and reminded everyone to be vigilant against the international disputes that these groups may cause. He said: The war preparations taken by certain countries against Egypt are an open and intolerable provocation against the freedom-loving people of Egypt, against the people of Eastern countries striving for national independence and sovereignty, and against peace. We believe it is our duty to reiterate this warning today.

### 谢皮洛夫就伦敦会议结果发表声明说  警惕英法美集团针对埃及的备战措施  指出所谓“五国委员会”的组成是分裂会议的行动

    谢皮洛夫就伦敦会议结果发表声明说
    警惕英法美集团针对埃及的备战措施
    指出所谓“五国委员会”的组成是分裂会议的行动
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫
  8月24日在伦敦举行记者招待会，就苏彝士运河问题伦敦会议的结果发表声明。
    谢皮洛夫指出，伦敦会议是在这样的情况下开始工作的，这种情况是：英法两国的某些人士围绕埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化的问题人为地制造一种紧张和不安的气氛，而且，为了对埃及施行压力，有人对埃及采取了毫无道理的经济制裁，并且悍然破坏联合国宪章而对埃及采取了军事准备措施。
            会议的安排别有用心
    谢皮洛夫说，许多国家的政府，其中包括苏联政府，都已经公正地指出，会议成员的选择是别有用心的：在五十个利用苏彝士运河的国家中只有二十四个国家被邀参加会议，而其中大多数都是像北大西洋集团、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织这样一些侵略性军事集团的参加者。
    同时，在会议的筹备过程中就进行了一切准备工作，以便排斥埃及在平等的基础上参加伦敦会议的可能性。
    所制定的会议程序也明显地说明了这次会议的发起国是要那些别有用心地挑选出来的会议成员接受事先准备好的解决苏彝士运河问题的措施和原则，以便以后假借会议的决议来放手采取下一步行动。而且，虽然有二十多个同运河畅通有利害关系的国家没有出席，虽然埃及没有出席，但是竟然还有人建议会议采用以简单多数通过决定的程序；建议赋予会议主席掌握会议的大权；建议限制与会国代表发言的时间和次数等等。这一切证明：有人企图推翻或限制为进行这类会议所必须遵守的公认的民主原则，来圆满解决会议组织者事先提出的任务。不用说，许多国家的代表团不能同意这类破坏公认的准则的方案。结果，所提出的程序和议程都没有通过。这是会议发起者的第一个失败。
            两条不同路线的冲突
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到伦敦会议上所讨论到的苏彝士运河问题的某些最重要的方面。他说：伦敦会议主要是两条完全不同的路线的冲突。是解决苏彝士运河问题的两个完全不同的原则的冲突。一条路线反映在由印度提出并且得到印度尼西亚、锡兰和苏联支持的建议中；另一条路线反映在大家都知道的所谓“杜勒斯计划”的美国建议中。
    印度建议的实质是从承认和尊重埃及国家主权的原则出发的，它认为埃及作为苏彝士运河的主人应当实现管理运河的职能。同时也规定一个把作为主权国家的埃及的利益和使用运河的各国的利益正确结合起来的一定的原则。苏联代表团赞同印度的计划，同时也发表了自己一系列具体见解，尤其是谈到它认为什么形式的国际合作才可以在尊重埃及主权的情况下使苏彝士运河作为自由开放的海道而正常地发挥作用，以利于世界贸易，符合埃及的利益。
    美国代表团提交会议的方案规定剥夺埃及政府对苏彝士运河的管理和主权，而建立外国管理苏彝士运河的机构，以及甚至采取“有效制裁”，支持任何阻挠埃及管理运河的行动。美国方案规定的管理苏彝士运河的国际机构是埃及“国家中的国家”。这就是要在埃及建立某种形式的殖民制度。美国的计划还抛弃了把埃及当作一个平等和有主权的国家而同它进行谈判的原则。这种方案同我们时代的精神、同联合国的最高原则和宗旨是不相符的。
    伦敦会议所讨论的实际是如何对待埃及的问题，即把它当作独立、主权和平等的国家、联合国的会员国、自己国家的全权主人看待呢，还是公开地践踏国际法准则、联合国的原则和宗旨、埃及的合法权利和主权呢。也就是说，会上是在讨论承认或是不承认各国人民的自由和独立这一个最重要的原则，讨论具体地付诸行动而不是口头上形式地提一提的主权原则。
    谢皮洛夫着重指出，苏联完全知道，苏彝士运河的航行自由对许多国家，特别是对英国和法国的重要意义。苏联作为一个进行广泛的国际贸易的海上大国，对苏彝士运河和苏联同各国共同使用的其他海道的航行自由，是有直接利害关系的。保证苏彝士运河航行自由的必要性是绝对无可争辩的，但是这个问题绝不能在侵犯埃及主权的情况下解决，而应当使二者结合起来，印度的方案就提供了这种结合。
    推行“杜勒斯计划”的企图没有成功
    谢皮洛夫详细谈到了伦敦会议的发起国在会议最后两天打算以会议名义强迫埃及接受所谓“杜勒斯计划”的阴谋。他说，尽管会议的发起国为了阻挠争取公平合理地解决苏彝士问题的国家的代表陈述自己的观点而设置了重重障碍，但是主要殖民国家的代表想利用这个会议以国际会议的名义向埃及提出奴役性的最后通牒的要求的企图，仍然没有成功。伦敦会议终于通过了唯一的决定：委托会议主席把伦敦会议的全部记录交给埃及政府。
    谢皮洛夫指出，某些报纸把事情说成似乎会议最终委托澳大利亚等五国代表把美国在会议上提出的计划交给埃及政府，这是不符合事实的。会议没有通过这样的决议。
    谢皮洛夫说，苏联代表团在会议的最后阶段建议通过一项由各国署名的简短公报，在这一公报中可以阐明和平公正解决苏彝士运河问题的那些原则，而便于参加会议的一切国家同埃及政府共同研究这样一个问题：在尊重埃及的主权和尊严以及尊重使用运河的其他国家的利益的情况下解决运河通航自由的问题。
    然而，某些人士想分裂会议，以便超越会议的范围向埃及提出“杜勒斯计划”的要求。由于这些分裂的行动，在会议的范围以外组成了所谓“五国委员会”。
    打算分裂会议以及为了向埃及提出要求而在会议的范围以外成立某种集团，是那些为了强迫埃及接受某些殖民主义的条件和要求而指望苏彝士问题尖锐化的势力和主张在伦敦会议上遭到道义上和政治上的失败的结果。
    谢皮洛夫指出，在伦敦会议上并没有一个团结一致的十七国或者十八国集团无条件地赞同“杜勒斯计划”的原则。在讨论的过程中，丹麦、挪威、伊朗、西班牙、日本和其他某些国家的代表都指出，他们的政府认为唯一可能解决苏彝士问题的办法是和平的办法，是把埃及看成一个有主权的国家而同它进行谈判的办法。他们提出了许许多多的保留和意见。
      苏印等国的主张将得到广泛响应
    在伦敦会议中，印度提案以及印度尼西亚、锡兰、印度和苏联代表团的发言所反映的对解决运河问题的爱好和平的民主的态度，却会得到东西方千千万万人的热烈响应。
    谢皮洛夫最后指出了由于英国、法国和美国的那些拥护以实力地位解决苏彝士问题的集团加紧活动而可能造成的局势的严重性，并且提醒大家警惕这些集团所能引起的国际纠纷。他说：某些国家针对埃及的备战措施，是对爱好自由的埃及人民、对争取民族独立和主权的东方各国人民的公开的、不可容忍的挑衅，是对和平的挑衅。我们认为有责任在今天重申这一警告。
