Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 13th regarding agricultural production cooperatives actively selecting and retaining breeding male and female livestock and doing a good job in mating and breeding work.

The notice first pointed out that the number of various livestock mated and bred in the first half of this year has decreased significantly compared with previous years. One of the important reasons for this serious phenomenon is that various regions have not paid close attention to mating work, have not paid sufficient attention to protecting and selecting breeding livestock, and there is a shortage of breeding male and female livestock. For example, the Xuanwu Lake Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanjing has a total of 61 head of draught cattle, none of which are bulls, and all the cows have failed to mate and are empty. In some areas, there was a habit of raising breeding bulls, but some agricultural cooperatives overworked the breeding bulls as ordinary draught cattle, making them unusable for mating. Some agricultural cooperatives also exclude breeding bulls from joining the cooperative, offering low prices for breeding bulls to join, and the remuneration for members (former mating experts) who are responsible for mating work is unreasonable, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of breeding bulls, affecting the development of mating work. For example, in Li County, Gansu Province, there were more than 800 breeding bulls in December 1955, but by the spring of 1956, the number had decreased to more than 200. In Wangdu County, Hebei Province, there were 14 breeding bulls, but only five were used for mating. In terms of hog production, the current shortage of boars and sows is even more prominent. For example, the current number of sows in Hubei Province accounts for only 4.8% of the total number of hogs. In Hunan Province, the ratio of breeding boars to breeding sows is as low as 1:50. Piglets are lacking in most areas.

In order to ensure the completion of the task of increasing livestock and hog breeding this year and next year, the notice requires all regions to: 1. Conduct publicity and education work on breeding draught cattle. Agricultural cooperatives with insufficient cows must increase the number of cows. The ratio of cows that can be bred should generally not be lower than 30%-50% of the total number of draught cattle. At the same time, an appropriate number of excellent breeding bulls should be equipped according to the number of cows that can be bred (there should be one breeding bull for every 40-60 cows) for mating and breeding to improve the quality of offspring. Breeding bulls retained outside the cooperative should be given a higher price to encourage them to join the cooperative, and the expertise of members who are breeding livestock households should be brought into play, giving them reasonable remuneration higher than that of ordinary farm workers. In areas lacking breeding bulls, emphasis should be placed on selecting and breeding from young livestock, or the local government should assist in purchasing from outside.

2.  It is necessary to greatly increase the number of breeding boars and breeding sows and breed piglets. Before the end of this year, the number of sows that can be bred in various regions should generally strive to reach 17% of the existing number of hogs. At the same time, one breeding boar should be equipped for every 20-25 sows. Each agricultural cooperative is required to retain sufficient breeding boars and breeding sows according to the cooperative's public and private hog development plan, and with reference to the above percentages, so as to achieve self-breeding and self-raising. Boars are best raised by the cooperative; sows can be raised publicly by the cooperative, organized by cooperative members' families, or contracted to cooperative members for raising, depending on the specific conditions. Cooperative members who raise hogs at home should be given appropriate hog raising time so that they can do a good job in feeding and management. 3. Although the mating time for horses and donkeys has passed this year, cattle and pigs can be mated all year round, and sheep have entered the mating season. Agricultural departments in various regions should generally urge county and township people's committees to seize the opportunity to vigorously carry out the mating and breeding of various livestock. At the same time, efforts should be organized to conduct inspections, specifically solve practical problems, and strive to mate as much as possible and accurately this year, so as to lay a good foundation for breeding a large number of various livestock next year.

### 今年上半年家畜繁殖数量显著减少  农业部要求各地做好牲畜配种工作

    今年上半年家畜繁殖数量显著减少
    农业部要求各地做好牲畜配种工作
    新华社14日讯　农业部在十三日发出关于农业生产合作社应积极选留种公母畜做好配种繁殖工作的通知。
    通知首先指出，今年上半年各种家畜配种繁殖数量比往年显著减少。造成这种严重现象的重要原因之一，是各地对于配种工作抓的不紧，对保护选留种畜工作重视不足，种公畜和种母畜缺乏。如南京玄武湖农业生产合作社共有耕牛六十一头，没有一头公牛，母牛全部失配空怀。有些地区本来有养种公畜习惯，但有些农业社把种公畜当成一般耕畜过度使役，不能用以配种。也有一些农业社排斥种公畜入社，对种公畜入社作价偏低，对担任配种工作的社员（以前的配种行家）报酬不合理，以致种公畜数量大大减少，影响配种工作的开展。如甘肃省礼县1955年12月有种公畜八百多头，至1956年春季减少到二百多头。河北省望都县有种公畜十四头，但用以配种的只有五头。在生猪生产方面，目前公猪、母猪不足的现象更为突出。如湖北省现有母猪数仅为生猪总数的4.8％。湖南省目前种公猪与种母猪的比例低到1比50。多数地区仔猪缺乏。
    为了保证今年以至明年牲畜及生猪增殖任务的完成，通知要求各地：一、进行关于繁殖耕畜的宣传教育工作。母畜不足的农业社必须增加母畜数量，可繁殖母畜的比率一般不应低于耕畜总数的30％—50％。同时应该根据可繁殖母畜头数，配备适当数量的优良种公畜（每40—60头母畜应该有一头种公畜），以便配种繁殖，提高后代品质。对留在社外的种公畜应该给以较高价格，吸收入社，并且要发挥种畜户社员的专长，给以较一般农工较高的合理报酬。缺乏种公畜的地区，应该强调在幼畜中选育培养，或者由地方政府协助向外采购。
    二、必须大量增养种公猪和种母猪，繁殖小猪。今年年底以前，各地能繁殖的母猪数，一般要争取达到现有猪数的17％。同时每20—25头母猪应该配备一头种公猪。要求每一个农业社根据社内公、私养猪发展计划，并参照上列百分比留养足够的种公猪和种母猪，做到自繁自养。公猪最好由社饲养；母猪可视具体条件，采用由社公养，或组织社员家庭饲养，或包给社员代养。对家庭养猪的社员，应该适当给以养猪时间，使他们能够做好饲养管理工作。三、今年马、驴的配种时间虽已过去，但牛、猪可以常年配种，羊已进入配种季节。各地农业部门普遍督促县、乡人民委员会抓紧时机，大力进行各种家畜的配种繁殖工作。同时应该组织力量，进行检查，具体解决实际问题，争取能在今年尽量地多配、配准，为明年大量繁殖各种家畜打好基础。
