    A Fly in the Ointment
    The Red Star milk powder produced by Anda Dairy Factory is indeed a milk powder of fairly good quality. According to the advertisement, its quality "meets the Soviet first-class standard and the national export standard." However, recently I found impurities in the sweetened Red Star milk powder in square boxes. Once it was a thin white hair, which looked like it came from the belly of a cow; another time it was a small piece of ginger-yellow flake. This has to be said to be a fly in the ointment, and I hope it will attract the attention of the Anda Dairy Factory.

    美中不足
    安达乳粉厂出品的红星奶粉，的确是一种质量相当好的奶粉，据广告上说：质量“符合苏联一级标准和国家出口标准”。但是，最近我却发现方盒加糖红星奶粉里掺有杂质，一次是一根白细毛，好像是牛肚皮上的；一次是一小块姜黄色的薄片。这不能不说是美中不足，希望引起安达乳粉厂的注意。
