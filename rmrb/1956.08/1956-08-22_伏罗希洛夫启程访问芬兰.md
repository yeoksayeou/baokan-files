Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: At the invitation of Finnish President Kekkonen, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, departed for Finland on August 20th for a visit.

Accompanying Voroshilov on his visit to Finland were: Gorkin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; Mikhailov, Minister of Culture of the USSR; and Varaksin, Minister of the Paper and Wood Processing Industry. Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Wori, accompanied them to Finland.

Today's "Pravda" published an editorial stating that Voroshilov's visit is another important proof of Soviet-Finnish friendly relations. The editorial said that gatherings between political leaders of the two countries and private mutual visits have helped establish the atmosphere of respect and trust in current Soviet-Finnish relations. Soviet-Finnish relations are a vivid example of perfect cooperation between large and small countries and a convincing proof that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully.
