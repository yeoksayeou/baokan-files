Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 10th. The flood peaks of the Daqing, Ziya, and Nan Canal began to enter Tianjin today. However, because the first flood peak from the Yongding River has passed, and three breaches occurred in the middle reaches of the Daqing and Ziya Rivers, the water level of the Hai River in Tianjin did not rise compared to yesterday as of 6:00 PM.

At 9:00 AM, Tianjin experienced a heavy rainstorm, followed by continuous drizzle throughout the day.

Today, trucks continued to transport sand, gravel, soil, wooden stakes, and麻袋 (ma dai, gunny sacks/burlap bags) to the riverbanks that needed to be raised and reinforced. Near the Da Hong Bridge and Beiyang Bridge, the lights were bright at night as flood prevention teams continued to work intensely. The state-owned Tianjin No. 3 People's Paper Mill, located on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Ziya River, has been surrounded by floodwaters overflowing the small dike, but production is still proceeding as usual because a relatively strong protective dike has been built around it.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the people of the city to heighten their vigilance, correct all麻痹 (ma bi, numbness) and僥幸 (jiao xing, fluke) thinking, and make full preparations to cope with the most serious situation that may occur.

    天津水势平稳
    新华社天津10日电　大清、子牙、南运河的洪峰今天开始进入天津。但由于永定河下泄的首次洪峰已过，以及大清河、子牙河的中游发生了三处决口，到下午六时，天津海河的水位和昨天比较，没有上升。
    上午九时，天津曾下了一阵暴雨，接着细雨绵延终日。
    今天，汽车仍是不断地把砂石、泥土、木桩、麻袋等运送到各个需要加高、加固的河堤旁。大红桥、北洋桥附近，入夜灯火辉煌，防汛队员在继续紧张施工。位在子牙河下梢北岸的国营天津市第三人民造纸厂，已被溢出小堤的洪水包围，但因为周围已筑起较坚固的防护堤，厂里生产仍然照常进行。
    天津市人民委员会和中共天津市委号召全市人民提高警惕，纠正一切麻痹侥幸思想，作好充分准备，以应付可能发生的最严重情况。
