    Reactions to Criticism

    A letter from the Political Department of the Training Regiment of the Henan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: The reader's letter "Cannot Be So Careless" published on page four of the People's Daily on July 30 mentioned that our regiment was careless in writing letters of recommendation for Party members, and introduced non-Party members Tang Jianghai and Wang Shengtai (after investigation, it was not Wang Shengchun) as formal Party members. This is indeed the case. We have criticized and educated the personnel involved, and at the same time ordered the lower-level Party committees and political organs to pay attention to preventing similar incidents from happening in future work.
    A letter from the Second Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee stated: The article "Official Documents Are Always Sleeping" on July 5 criticized our backlog of official documents. This criticism is correct, and the backlog is far more serious than indicated. Not only is there a backlog, but more than sixty official documents are still missing. The criticism in the People's Daily has prompted us to further examine our past work and improve our working methods in all aspects. After repeated research, we have identified the reasons for the backlog of official documents and have determined methods to improve our work.

    对批评的反应
    中国人民解放军河南军区训练团政治处来信：七月三十日人民日报第四版登载读者来信“不能这样马虎”一文，其中提到我团在开写党员介绍信时粗枝大叶，把非党群众唐江海、王生泰（经查不是王生春）介绍为正式党员一事，是确实的。我们已对有关人员进行了批评教育，同时责成下级党委和政治机关今后在工作中注意防止类似事件发生。
    天津市人民委员会第二办公室来信说：七月五日“公文老在睡觉”一文，批评了我们对公文的积压，这个批评是正确的，而积压情况远比所指出的还要严重。不仅积压，甚至尚有六十多件公文至今查无下落。人民日报的批评促使我们更进一步地检查过去的工作，并从各方面改进工作方法。我们经过反复研究，找出了公文积压的原因，并已经确定了改进工作的方法。
