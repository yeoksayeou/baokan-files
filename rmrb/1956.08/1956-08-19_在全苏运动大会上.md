At the All-Union Sports Meet
Breaking Records Fifteen and a Half Times a Day

The All-Union Sports Meet, which lasted for twelve consecutive days, concluded on the 16th. From the very first day of the All-Union Sports Meet, good news of Soviet athletes breaking republic, all-Union, all-European, and world records was constantly reported. According to precise statistics, records were broken an average of fifteen and a half times a day. Throughout the entire meet, twenty-eight all-Union, all-European, and world records alone were broken.

Fresh Troops

Among the more than nine thousand top athletes, two-thirds were no more than twenty-five years old. The Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol established two championships for this purpose: "To the youngest athlete who meets the standard of a sports master" and "To the youngest athlete who creates an All-Union record." The winner of the former championship was G. Androsov, who had just turned seventeen two weeks ago. He is a tenth-grade student in middle school. He was the first to reach the finish line in the 1,500-meter swimming competition at the All-Union Sports Meet, winning a gold medal. The winner of the latter championship was also a nineteen-year-old female student, Voko, who broke the All-Union record in the 400-meter freestyle swimming competition with a time of five minutes and 19.7 seconds.

Athletes Become Firefighters

One night, Komsomol member and athlete A. Volkov was lying in bed at the hotel, unable to sleep, thinking about the fierce competition to come. Suddenly, he saw flames and smoke from the window, a fire somewhere. He quickly dressed and ran to the scene. A Pushkin exhibition was being held there. He unhesitatingly broke open the door and rescued oil paintings and movie machines. Finally, he was injured. Afterwards, someone asked Volkov: Did you tell the relevant authorities about your merits? Volkov's reply was: "How can this be called merit? This is what every Soviet person should do."

Another New World Record

Another new world record appeared in the track and field competition held on August 14th. A year ago, sports fans did not know the name Zhishkin. Today, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, this young athlete not only won the title of All-Union Sports Meet champion but also broke the world record of eight minutes and 40.2 seconds set by Polish athlete Hromik with a time of eight minutes and 39.8 seconds.

    在全苏运动大会上
    每天打破纪录十五次半
    连续十二天的全苏运动大会于十六日宣告闭幕，从全苏运动大会第一天开始，苏联运动员打破共和国的、全苏的、全欧洲的和全世界的纪录的捷报天天传来。根据精确的统计，平均每天打破纪录十五次半。在整个大会期间，仅全苏、全欧洲和全世界纪录就刷新了二十八项。
    生力军
    在九千多名最优秀的运动员中，三分之二的人都不超过二十五岁。苏联共青团中央为此设立了“给达到运动健将标准的最年轻的运动员”和“给创造全苏纪录的最年轻的运动员”两项锦标。前一项锦标的获得者是吉·安得洛索夫，他在两星期前才满十七岁，是中学十年级的学生，他在全苏运动大会一千五百公尺游泳竞赛中第一个到达终点，获得金质奖章。后一项锦标的获得者也是一个十九岁的女学生沃科，她在四百公尺自由式游泳竞赛中以五分十九秒七的成绩刷新全苏最高纪录。
    运动员变成救火员
    一天晚上，共青团员、运动员阿·伏尔科夫躺在旅馆的床上没有睡着，他在想着即将来到的激烈的竞赛。突然，他从窗口中看到火焰和浓烟，什么地方失火了。他迅速地穿好衣服跑到出事地点，这里正在举办普希金展览会，他毫不犹豫地劈开大门，抢救油画和电影机器，最后他受伤了。事后，有人问伏尔科夫：你有没有把你的功绩告诉有关机关，伏尔科夫的答复是：“这怎么叫做功绩呢？这是每个苏维埃人都应做的事。”
    又一个新的世界纪录
    在八月十四日举行的田径赛中又出现一项新的世界纪录。一年以前，体育爱好者们还不知道日什金这个名字。今天在三千公尺障碍物赛跑中，这个年轻的运动员不但获得了全苏运动会冠军的称号，并且以八分三十九点八秒的成绩打破了波兰运动员赫罗米克所创的八分四十点二秒的世界纪录。
