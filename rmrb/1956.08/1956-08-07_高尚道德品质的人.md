    Person with Noble Moral Character
    Editor:
    After reading the reader's letter "He Should Be Punished by Law" on the fourth page of the July 18th People's Daily, I couldn't help but think of Comrade Lai Wen'an, who possesses noble moral character. In 1955, he was introduced to a female comrade working in an organization in Guangzhou. After more than a year of getting to know each other, they fell in love. On May 27th of this year, he suddenly received a letter from this female comrade, which said: "For the past two days, something has been bothering me. Before I met you, I was in love with another comrade, but later, for some reason, we broke off the relationship. Two days ago, this comrade returned to work in our unit. I love him and you equally. How can I be at peace?" The letter also asked Comrade Lai Wen'an for his opinion on the matter. After careful consideration, Comrade Lai Wen'an resolutely gave her a reply like this: "I am unwilling to build my own happiness at the expense of someone else's happiness. Let's be ordinary friends from now on." Of course, this is painful for me, but it is temporary, and I will slowly forget this pain in my work. Comrade Lai Wen'an's actions not only earned the respect of the woman and that comrade but also the praise of everyone.
    When I think of this matter, I feel even more hatred for Hu Jingzhou's despicable behavior.

### 高尚道德品质的人

专栏：读者来信

    高尚道德品质的人编辑同志：
    我看了七月十八日人民日报第四版上的“他应该受到法律制裁”的读者来信以后，不禁使我想起具有高尚道德品质的赖文安同志。他在1955年经人介绍，认识了在广州某机关工作的一位女同志，经过一年多的了解，两人相爱起来。今年五月二十七日他突然接到这位女同志的一封来信，信中说：两天来，有一件事使我不能安静，因为在我没有和你认识以前，曾和一位同志相爱，后来因为某种原因，断绝了关系。两天前，这个同志又回到我们单位来工作。我爱他和爱你是一样的，这样，怎么能使我安静呢？信中还要求赖文安同志对这件事发表意见。赖文安同志经过慎重考虑，毅然决然给了她一封这样的回信：我不愿牺牲别人的幸福来建立自己的幸福，我们今后做个普通朋友吧。这样做对我来说当然是痛苦的，但是这是暂时的，我会在工作中慢慢的忘记这个痛苦。赖文安同志这样做，不但受到女方和那个同志的尊敬，也受到大家的赞扬。
    当我想起这件事的时候，我对胡景洲的卑鄙行为越加憎恨。
