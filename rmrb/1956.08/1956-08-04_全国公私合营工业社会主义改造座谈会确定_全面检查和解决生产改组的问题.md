Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The National Symposium on Socialist Transformation of Public-Private Jointly Operated Industry convened by the Fourth Office of the State Council in Beijing, studied the current production reorganization, production and operation, employee life, public-private cooperation and enterprise management issues of public-private jointly operated industries in various regions.

This meeting lasted twenty-two days and concluded on July 30th. More than 140 people attended the meeting, including heads of industrial departments (bureaus) from various provinces and cities, and representatives from various industrial ministries and relevant units of the central government.

Two Situations of Reorganization and Merging Factories
The meeting listened to reports from various regions. The reorganization and merging of factories in the first half of the year generally fell into two categories: Some regions steadily carried out reorganization planning and work based on the spirit of "major parts remain unchanged, minor parts adjusted," such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Wuhan, and other places. These regions generally adopted the method of first linking and then merging, resulting in fewer mergers. Other regions, based on local production needs and management requirements, systematically carried out some factory mergers. Hunan and other provinces merged about one-third of the newly public-private joint factories; Jilin, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and other provinces merged about one-half; Anhui, Liaoning, Henan, and other provinces merged up to about two-thirds. According to reports from various regions, the majority of the merged factories are generally doing well, some were merged too early and hastily, and a few were merged incorrectly.

Conduct a Comprehensive Inspection
The meeting believed that the provinces and cities should first conduct a comprehensive inspection of the reorganized factories to see if there are any problems in production, personnel arrangements, employee living and working conditions, meeting social needs, and serving the masses. Those factories that have merged well should be consolidated and improved. Those factories that were merged too early and hastily due to insufficient preparation and incomplete conditions, resulting in crowded factory buildings and dormitories, poor employee living and working conditions, chaotic management, and decreased production, should actively take measures to resolve these problems. Those factories that should not have been merged, especially repair and service industries, should be appropriately dispersed in a planned manner according to the characteristics and specific circumstances of the industry. Those base point factories that were improperly selected or improperly linked should also be appropriately adjusted.

Regions and industries that are currently undergoing reorganization and formulating reorganization plans should, in addition to reorganizing a few difficult industries and enterprises first to facilitate overcoming difficulties, promptly formulate comprehensive reorganization plans by industry, actively prepare and create conditions, and steadily proceed in stages and batches, adapting to local conditions.

In the second half of this year, the focus of public-private joint enterprises should still be on improving production. In addition to inspecting and handling the remaining problems in the reorganization and continuing the reorganization, all regions should adjust organizations, preserve reasonable management systems and establish necessary ones, and gradually strengthen planned management in factories that have been initially reorganized, according to the production needs and enterprise characteristics of the new public-private joint factories. At the same time, select typical cases, study and summarize experiences.

Methods for Resolving Financial Difficulties
The meeting conducted research on the current financial difficulties faced by public-private joint factories. It was unanimously believed that many public-private joint factories had financial difficulties during the private period. After the public-private joint operation, credit sales and advance deposits were no longer available. With the expansion of production, the need for working capital increased. In addition, the fixed interest for the first half of 1956 was about to be paid, the wages owed to employees in the past that were classified as the responsibility of the enterprise to repay during the asset verification needed to be repaid, several labor conditions and employee living problems urgently needed to be resolved; at the same time, a portion of reconstruction and expansion investment was also needed in the production reorganization. These all urgently needed to be resolved. The meeting believed that the income of the public-private joint industrial systems in the provinces and cities, in addition to being dispatched by the Bank of Communications according to the original plan, should allocate basic construction investment to public-private joint enterprises according to the indicators verified by the State Planning Commission, and allocate working capital to them according to the working capital plan. The insufficient portion should be adjusted by the industrial departments, and if it cannot be resolved, it is recommended that the People's Bank of China provide loans. Especially at a time when the Bank of Communications has very little income and cannot meet the working capital needs of public-private joint industrial enterprises, it is even more necessary for the People's Bank of China to provide loan support to help public-private joint industry solve difficulties such as production turnover funds and payment of fixed interest.

The meeting requested that the provincial and municipal industrial departments and bureaus, together with the financial departments and bureaus, convene a public-private joint industrial financial meeting in August 1956 to study issues such as the payment of fixed interest, reconstruction and expansion investment, and accounting.

Subsidizing Workers with Difficult Living Conditions
According to the meeting's feedback, another problem that urgently needs to be solved in the public-private joint industry is that the wages of some workers are very low, and the medical expenses, sick leave, and maternity leave wages of workers in some small factories cannot be resolved, and families in difficult living conditions do not receive subsidies. The meeting believes that the resolution of the wage problem awaits special study at the wage conference to be convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other departments in early August. Before a unified adjustment is made, appropriate subsidies can be given to those with wages that are currently too low and who are experiencing financial difficulties, after approval by the provincial and municipal leading organs.

From the date of fixed interest, public-private joint industrial enterprises can extract enterprise bonus funds and supplementary wages according to the methods of local state-owned enterprises. Public-private joint industrial enterprises should also, together with local trade union organizations, study the issue of employee labor insurance benefits. Before labor insurance benefits are resolved, it is necessary to first resolve the medical expenses and wages during sick leave and maternity leave of the employees themselves, as well as subsidies for families in difficult living conditions. For wages owed to employees during the private factory period, which were deducted from the capitalist's shares and assigned to the joint venture to be responsible for repayment at the time of public-private joint venture, they should be returned to the employees in full, in large part, or in part before or at the same time as the payment of fixed interest, after consultation with the trade union based on the circumstances.

Capitalist Personnel Should Have Authority and Responsibility
Regarding the issue of public-private cooperation in enterprises, the meeting believed that most of the capitalist personnel have production technology knowledge and management capabilities, which are needed for socialist construction. Over the years, capitalist personnel have been somewhat reformed. After the implementation of public-private joint operation and fixed interest in the entire industry, the nature of the enterprise has undergone a fundamental change. The vast majority of capitalist personnel are willing to accept the policy of peaceful transformation; although they still have certain shortcomings in their thinking and style, most of them can be gradually changed through education and transformation. Therefore, in the future, education on the united front policy should be strengthened in public-private joint enterprises, and the broad masses of employees should be informed that transforming capitalist personnel into self-reliant workers so that they can serve socialism is beneficial to the working class.

The meeting pointed out that for capitalist personnel working in enterprises, they should be given specific tasks under collective leadership, so that they have authority, responsibility, and power; public representatives should not replace their work. Cadres and employees should be educated to respect the leadership and opinions of capitalist personnel in their positions within their responsibilities. Regular forums for both public and private parties should be held within the enterprise to encourage full discussion of different opinions. They should be helped to transform in production practice, establish ideas such as relying on the masses, improving operations, and emphasizing product quality and production safety.

The meeting believed that administrative documents related to production and operation and publications for exchanging experiences should be distributed to capitalist personnel for reading. Relevant capitalist personnel should be invited to participate in production and business meetings held by industrial management departments. Industrial departments at all levels should establish specialized agencies and designate dedicated personnel among the responsible personnel to be responsible for educating and helping capitalists transform, and hold regular forums to promptly resolve problems existing in public-private cooperation.

Establish Democratic Management Committees
In addition, the meeting also put forward some opinions on the management of public-private joint industry. The main requirement is that public-private joint factories should ideally establish democratic management committees to be responsible for studying production arrangements and problems that need to be solved in production and operation. Industrial departments (bureaus) and professional companies should pilot the establishment of business improvement committees in the second half of this year, inviting experienced and technically knowledgeable cadres, capitalist personnel, and employees to participate.

Regarding the issues between industry and commerce, the meeting believed that the joint circular recently issued by the Central Ministry of Commerce and relevant industrial departments has made several provisions on some of the main issues that are currently needed and can be resolved, and all regions should conscientiously implement them in accordance with the provisions.

    全国公私合营工业社会主义改造座谈会确定
    全面检查和解决生产改组的问题
    新华社3日讯　国务院第四办公室在北京召开的全国公私合营工业社会主义改造座谈会，研究了目前各地公私合营工业的生产改组、生产经营、职工生活、公私共事和企业管理等问题。
    这次会议历时二十二天，已经在七月三十日结束。参加会议的有各省市工业厅（局）负责人和中央各工业部、各有关单位代表一百四十多人。
  改组并厂的两种情况
    会议听取了各地汇报，上半年的改组并厂工作，大体上有两种情况：有部分地区是根据大部不动小部调整的精神，稳步地进行了改组的规划和工作，如上海、天津、山东、武汉等地。这些地区一般是采取先联后并的办法，合并得较少。另有一部分地区，则根据当地生产的需要和经营管理的要求，有计划地进行了一些并厂工作。湖南等省在新公私合营的工厂户数中合并了三分之一左右；吉林、黑龙江、贵州等省合并了二分之一左右；安徽、辽宁、河南等省合并的达三分之二左右。据各地汇报，在已经合并的工厂中，基本上并得好的占多数，有一部分并得过早过急，还有少数是并错了的。
  进行一次全面检查
    会议认为目前各省市应该首先对改组后的工厂进行一次全面的检查，看生产情况、人事安排、职工生活和劳动条件以及满足社会需要、为群众服务等方面有无问题。对那些合并得好的工厂，要加以巩固和提高。对那些准备不足、条件不完全具备而并得过早过急以致厂房、宿舍拥挤、职工生活劳动条件太差、管理混乱、生产下降的工厂，应该积极地采取措施加以解决。对那些不应该合并而合并的工厂，特别是修理服务性的行业，应该根据行业的特点和具体情况，有计划地适当地分散。对那些基点厂选择不当或联得不当的，也应作适当的调整。
    目前正在进行改组和制定改组规划的地区、行业，除了对少数困难的行业、企业先进行改组有利于克服困难的以外，应该及早按行业定出全面的改组规划，积极准备和创造条件，因地制宜地分期分批地稳步进行。
    今年下半年在公私合营企业中，仍然应当以搞好生产为中心。各地除检查处理改组中的遗留问题和继续进行改组外，在已经初步改组的工厂中，应该根据新公私合营工厂的生产需要和企业特点，调整组织、保存合理的和建立必要的管理制度，逐步加强计划管理。同时，选择典型，研究和总结经验。
  解决资金困难的办法
    会议针对目前公私合营工厂存在的资金困难情况，进行了研究。一致认为很多公私合营工厂，在私营时期资金就有困难，公私合营以后，赊销关系和预收订金没有了。随着生产的扩大，流动资金需要增加，加上1956年上半年定息即将发放，过去拖欠职工工资在清产核资时，划归企业负责归还的需要归还，若干劳动条件和职工生活问题急待解决；同时，在生产改组中也需要一部分改建扩建投资。这些都是迫切需要解决的。会议认为各省市的公私合营工业系统的收入，除按照原计划由交通银行调度外，应当按照国家计划委员会核定的指标，拨给公私合营企业基本建设投资，并按照流动资金计划，拨给他们流动资金。不足的部分，由工业部门设法调剂，解决不了的，建议人民银行贷款解决。特别是在目前交通银行收入很少，尚不能适应公私合营工业企业流动资金需要的情况下，更需要人民银行给予贷款支持，帮助公私合营工业解决生产周转资金、支付定息等困难。
    会议要求各省、市工业厅、局会同财政厅、局在1956年8月间召开公私合营工业财务会议，研究支付定息、改建扩建投资等开支以及建账等问题。
  补助生活困难的工人
    根据会议反映，目前公私合营工业亟待解决的另一问题，是部分工人的工资很低，某些小厂的工人医疗费用和病假、产假工资不能解决，家庭生活困难得不到补助。会议认为工资问题的解决，有待中华全国总工会等部门在八月上旬召开的工资会议专门研究。在没有统一调整之前，对于目前工资过低而生活有困难的，经过省市领导机关批准，可以先进行适当的补助。
    公私合营工业企业自定息之日起，可以按照地方国营企业的办法提取企业奖励基金和附加工资。公私合营工业企业还应当会同当地工会组织，研究职工的劳保待遇问题。在劳保待遇尚未解决前，首先要解决职工本人的医疗费用和病假、产假期间的工资，以及家庭生活困难的补助。对于在私营工厂时期所拖欠职工的工资，在公私合营的时候，已在资方股金中扣除划归合营企业负责归还的，应该根据情况和工会商量后，在支付定息之前或同时，全部、大部或一部归还给职工。
  资方人员应有职有权
    企业中公私共事问题，会议认为资方人员中间大多数是有生产技术知识和经营管理能力的，是社会主义建设所需要的。几年以来，资方人员已经得到了一定的改造。在全行业实行公私合营和定息以后，企业的性质已经起了根本的变化。绝大部分的资方人员愿意接受和平改造的政策；虽然他们在思想和作风方面还存在着某些缺陷，经过教育和改造，大多数是可以逐步改变的。因此，今后在公私合营企业中，应加强统一战线政策的教育，向广大职工说明，改造资方人员为自食其力的劳动者，使他们为社会主义服务，是对工人阶级有利的事情。
    会议指出，对于在企业工作的资方人员，应当在集体领导下，具体分工，使他们有职、有权、有责；公方代表不要代替他们的工作。要教育干部和职工，在资方人员的职责范围内，尊重他们职务上的领导和意见。在企业内部定期召开公私双方的座谈会，提倡对不同意见的充分讨论。帮助他们在生产实践中改造，树立依靠群众、改善经营、重视产品质量和生产安全等思想。
    会议认为，今后有关生产经营的行政文件和交流经验的刊物，应发给资方人员阅读。工业管理部门召开的生产业务会议，应当邀请有关的资方人员参加。各级工业部门要设立专门机构、并在负责人员中指定专人负责教育和帮助资本家改造，并定期召开座谈会，及时解决公私共事中存在的问题。
  成立民主管理委员会
    此外，会议对公私合营工业的管理问题，也提出些意见。主要是要求公私合营工厂，最好能成立民主管理委员会，负责研究生产安排和生产经营中需要解决的问题。工业厅、局和专业公司在今年下半年要试办业务改进委员会，吸收有经验、懂技术的干部、资方人员和职工参加。
    关于工业和商业之间的问题，会议认为中央商业部和有关的工业部门最近即将发出的联合通知，对目前需要而又可能解决的一些主要问题，已经作了若干规定，各地应该按照规定认真贯彻执行。
