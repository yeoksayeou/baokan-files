    Advanced Experience of Textile Industry
    Blossoms and Bears Fruit in Qingdao Cotton Textile Factories
    (Our dispatch) The sixteen advanced experiences taught by eighteen advanced textile producers from all over the country at the Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory in early July have universally blossomed and borne fruit in various factories in Qingdao.
    Since mid-July, the leadership of the eight state-owned and one joint state-private cotton textile factories under the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau have conducted a comprehensive study of the promotion of these sixteen advanced experiences, established promotion organizations, and formulated specific steps for promotion. They have also added necessary operating tools and improved individual machine equipment.
    When promoting these advanced experiences, the cotton textile factories mostly adopted the step of first cadres and then workers. The workshop director, workshop union chairman, technicians, deputy foreman, and union group leaders of the fine spinning workshop of the Qingdao No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory formed a study and promotion group of forty-five administrative and union workers, who studied for a week and completely mastered the five advanced experiences in fine spinning tending and doffing. After using the new doffing method, Xu Xiaohui, a union group leader and doffer, reduced the doffing time from 36 seconds to 32 seconds, and the end breakage rate also decreased from 36% to 26%.
    Following this, these factories comprehensively promoted the experience among workers using the method of "advanced experience schools". By July 27, the workers in the weaving workshop of the Qingdao No. 6 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory had completely mastered the advanced operating methods taught by advanced producer Qian Fendi. Weaver Chen Shiyou, who watched eight machines, used to produce substandard cloth frequently. After learning Qian Fendi's advanced operating experience in July, he has not produced a single piece of substandard cloth. (Ma Mingqi)

    纺织工业先进经验
    在青岛各棉纺织厂开花结果
    本报讯　来自全国各地的十八名纺织工业先进生产者，七月上旬在青岛棉纺织厂传授的十六项先进经验，已经在青岛各厂中普遍开花结果。
    从七月中旬以来，青岛纺织管理局所属的八个国营和一个公私合营棉纺织厂的领导方面，曾经对推广这十六项先进经验作了全面的研究，成立了推广组织，制定了推广的具体步骤。并且增添了必要的操作工具和改进了个别机件设备。
    各棉纺织厂在推广这些先进经验的时候，大都采取了先干部后工人的步骤。国营青岛第一棉纺织厂细纱车间的车间主任、车间工会主席、技术人员、副工长和工会组长等四十五个行政和工会工作人员组成了学习推广组，学习了一个星期，完全掌握了细纱值车和落纱方面的五项先进经验。工会组长落纱工徐小惠用新落纱法以后，落纱时间由三十六秒降低到三十二秒，断头率也由36％降低到26％。
    接着，这些工厂又用“先进经验学校”的方式在工人中全面推广。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂织布车间工人，到七月二十七日已经完全掌握了先进生产者钱芬娣传授的先进操作方法。值车工陈世友看八台车，过去经常出次布，七月份学习了钱芬娣的先进操作经验以后，就没出过一匹次布。　（马鸣歧）
