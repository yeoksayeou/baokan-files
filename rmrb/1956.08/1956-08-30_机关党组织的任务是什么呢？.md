Letter from a Party Member:

To the Editor:

I am a staff member of the Wuhan Municipal Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the Communist Party of China. For a long time, a problem has troubled us: What are the tasks of Party organizations in government offices? Why has this problem arisen? The main reason is that since 1954, our Party organizations in government offices have been bogged down in administrative affairs, and political and ideological work has been neglected.

The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC has criticized this bureaucratic work style. For more than a year, the Office Committee has been trying to break away from administrative affairs. However, "things go contrary to wishes," and the situation in which the Party organization takes on all administrative affairs has not changed. One reason is that we have not been resolute enough in breaking away. The other is that relevant departments have indiscriminately imposed administrative tasks on us, making it impossible to break away. For example, the 1955 annual conscription work in the directly subordinate organs of the city was instructed by the Municipal Committee to be handled by the Office Committee. The Committee not only had to carry out conscription propaganda and mobilization work (which is the work the Committee should do), but also had to handle the specific work of conscription screening, training conscription registration personnel, conducting military service registration, visual inspection, and physical examination. The same is true for promoting public bonds. The Committee has to start with ideological mobilization work, all the way to individual subscription registration, statistical reporting, payment, and the transfer of public bond relations when cadres are transferred. Even the specific organizational work of organizing voluntary labor, various celebrations, parades, receptions, and visits in the organs is contracted by the Committee from beginning to end. In this way, the Committee cannot help but fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy and cannot help but neglect the Party's political and ideological work. It is not only the Committee that is busy and chaotic, but also the general branches and branches below are also turning around in circles. Therefore, many branch secretaries have opinions on some of the administrative tasks frequently assigned by the Committee and ask: "Is the Party organization in government offices doing political work, or administrative work?" The cadres of the Committee itself also have opinions, asking: "Are we a Party organization in government offices or an administrative affairs bureau?" In order to change this situation, the Committee specifically wrote a report to the Municipal Committee on January 9 this year, requesting the Municipal Committee to resolve it. However, the Municipal Committee has not replied to the report of the Office Committee for more than half a year.

Because the problem has not been resolved, the situation of the Office Committee being busy with administrative affairs has been impossible to change. The Committee cannot stop some things that should not be handled, and it is really difficult to handle or not handle, making it difficult on both ends. Not to mention the things that the Municipal Committee or its departments ask us to do, but also the administrative departments ask the Committee to do more and more things. For example, recently the Municipal Military Service Committee needs the number of transferred military personnel in the directly subordinate organs of the city and also wants the Committee to conduct an investigation and report the statistics to them. The Committee believes that this is administrative work and asks them to handle it themselves through the administrative personnel department, but they disagree. A few days later, the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee called, asking the Committee to investigate the number of transferred military personnel in the organs for the Municipal Military Service Committee. We also explained the reason for not handling it to the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee, but the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee did not listen to these reasons at all, saying: "The minister asked you to handle it. Not handling it will affect unity." It is really inexplicable. Shouldn't we not handle things that we shouldn't handle, which will affect unity? We don't know what kind of "unity" this is based on? If this logic holds, then wouldn't it affect unity if we were forced to handle things that we shouldn't handle? I think this situation of Party organizations in government offices taking on all administrative affairs cannot continue, otherwise, the Party's political work will suffer even greater losses.

### 机关党组织的任务是什么呢？

    机关党组织的任务是什么呢？编辑同志：
    我是中共武汉市直属机关委员会的工作人员。长期以来，有一个问题使我们感到很苦恼：机关党组织的任务是什么？为什么会产生这样的问题呢？主要原因是从1954年以来，我们机关党组织就一直陷于行政事务工作中，政治思想工作反而放松了。
    这种事务主义的工作作风，中共武汉市委早就对我们提出过批评，一年多以来，机关党委也在力求摆脱行政事务。可是“事与愿违”，党组织包揽一切行政事务的状况毫无改变。原因是一方面我们摆脱得还不够坚决，另一方面也是由于有关部门不分性质地把行政工作任务给我们压下来，无法摆脱。如市直属机关中的1955年度征兵工作，市委指示由机关党委办理。党委不仅要作征兵的宣传动员工作（这是党委应作的工作），还要办理征兵摸底，训练征兵登记人员，进行兵役登记，目测和体格检查等一整套的具体工作。推销公债也是如此。党委要从思想动员工作做起，一直做到个人认购登记，统计表报、缴款以及干部调动时转移公债关系等一系列的具体工作为止。甚至机关里头组织义务劳动、组织各项庆祝、游行、接待、参观活动等等具体组织工作，从头到尾都要由党委承包。这样，党委就不能不陷入事务主义泥坑，不能不放松党的政治思想工作了。党委忙乱还不打紧，下边总支、支部也跟着忙乱得团团转。所以许多支部书记对党委经常布置的一些行政工作有意见，并问道：“机关党组织是作政治工作的呢？还是作行政工作的呢？”党委机关本身的干部也有意见，他们问道：“我们究竟是机关党组织呢？还是行政事务管理局呢？”为了改变这种状况，党委在今年一月九日曾专门向市委写了报告，请求市委予以解决。而市委对机关党委的报告至今半年多未作批复。
    因为问题没有得到解决，机关党委忙于行政事务的情况，就一直无法改变。对于一些不该办的事情，党委挡也挡不住，真是办也不好，不办也不好，两头作难。不用说市委或市委各部叫办的事情我们要办，就是行政部门叫党委办的事情也多起来了。例如最近市兵役委员会需要市直属机关中的转业军人数字，也要党委为他们进行调查，并统计向他们报告。党委认为这是行政工作，请他们自己通过行政人事部门办理，他们不同意。过了几天之后，市委组织部来了电话要党委为市兵役委员会调查机关中转业军人的数字，我们也同样的向市委组织部说明不予办理的道理，可是市委组织部根本不听这些道理，说什么：“部长叫你们办理，不办的话会影响团结。”真是莫名其妙，难道不应该我们办的事情我们不办就会影响团结？我们不知道这是建立在什么基础上的“团结”？如果这个逻辑能够成立的话，那么不应该由我们办的事硬要我们办，这就不会影响团结吗？我认为这种要机关党组织包办行政事务工作的情况，不能再继续下去了，不然，将会使党的政治工作受到更大的损失。　杨公志
