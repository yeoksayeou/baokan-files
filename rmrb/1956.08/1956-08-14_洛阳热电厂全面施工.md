Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, August 12th. The Luoyang Thermal Power Plant, which will provide power for the First Tractor Factory, the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, and the Sanmenxia construction project, has begun full-scale construction.

The Luoyang Thermal Power Plant is a modern, high-temperature, high-pressure thermal power plant with a high degree of automation in its main production processes. Operators will control machines from a distance, and generators will use hydrogen cooling instead of ventilation. Therefore, the power generation efficiency is very high.

In order to meet the power needs of various factories and construction projects, this plant will complete its construction tasks as quickly as possible. It will shorten the construction period by one-third to one-half compared to other thermal power plants of the same scale. The main plant building construction began on June 20th of this year and is expected to begin generating electricity in the third quarter of next year. The generating capacity of one of its units will exceed the existing power generation capacity of Luoyang by more than five times. Currently, the plant's auxiliary and supporting building projects, such as the production office building, joint material warehouse, main control room, open-air oil depot, grease workshop, and the internal railway spur line, have been completed or are nearing completion. Underneath the main plant building, construction workers have already poured tens of thousands of tons of reinforced concrete, and parts of the foundation have been built above ground.

    洛阳热电厂全面施工
    新华社洛阳12日电　为第一拖拉机制造厂、洛阳矿山机器厂和三门峡基建工程等提供动力的洛阳热电厂，已经开始全面施工。
    洛阳热电厂是一座现代化的高温高压热电厂，主要的生产过程自动化程度很高；操作人员在远距离控制机器，发电机用氢气冷却代替通风降温。因此，发电效率很高。
    为了适应各厂和基建工程的动力需要，这个厂将以最快的速度完成建厂任务。它比建设同样规模的其他热电厂，将缩短工期三分之一到二分之一。这个厂的主厂房建筑工程，从今年六月二十日开始施工，预计到明年的第三季度中，即可开始发电。它的一部机组，发电容量即超过洛阳现有发电量的五倍以上。目前，这个厂的附属和辅助建筑工程：生产办公楼、联合材料库、主控制室、露天油库、油脂作业室和厂内的铁路专用线等，都已经完成或接近完成。在主厂房的下面，建筑工人们已经投下了数万吨钢筋混凝土，部份基础已筑出地面。
