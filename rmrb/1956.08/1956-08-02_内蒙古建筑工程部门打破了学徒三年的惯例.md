Xinhua News Agency News:

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's construction engineering departments have generally conducted skill assessments and grade evaluations during the wage reform, making workers' wage levels more reasonable. According to the preliminary calculations of various units recently, an average of 25% of workers throughout the region have been promoted, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. Among them, the vast majority are apprentices who have been upgraded, breaking the old convention that apprentices, regardless of their skills, had to have more than three years of seniority before being upgraded. In this skill assessment and grade evaluation, several hundred skilled construction workers were promoted to technicians and foremen. A small number of workers whose grades were previously too high but whose skills were low have also been appropriately adjusted this time.
    Starting from the second quarter, the autonomous region's construction engineering departments began to study the technical grade standards for workers and conduct skill assessments and grade evaluations, arousing a surge of enthusiasm among workers to improve their skills. After studying, four directly affiliated engineering companies in Baotou, Hohhot and other cities, 40% of the workers improved their production skills and were promoted.

    内蒙古建筑工程部门打破了学徒三年的惯例
    新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各建筑工程部门在工资改革中，普遍进行了考工评级，使职工的工资等级更加合理。根据最近各单位初步的测算，全区平均有25％的工人被提级，比去年增加了50％多。其中徒工升级的占绝大多数，打破了过去不论技术如何，徒工都得有三年以上工龄才能升级的旧惯例。在这次考工评级中，几百名技术熟练的建筑工人被提拔为技术人员和工长。少部分过去等级偏高而技术低的工人，这次也作了适当的调整。
    从第二季度起，自治区各建筑工程部门就开始学习工人技术等级标准和考工评级，激起工人努力提高技术的热潮。包头、呼和浩特市等地的四个直属工程公司，经过学习以后，就有40％的工人提高了生产技术，得到了提级。
