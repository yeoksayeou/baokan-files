    "Praise Targets"
    Ke Yuelin
    What exactly are "praise targets"? Readers might find this a bit puzzling!
    This concerns the railways.
    Targets, like production targets in factories and mines, profit remittance targets, etc., are, as the name suggests, goals with specific numbers. With targets, workers have a direction to strive for in production, and leading departments have a standard by which to check the quality of work. These targets are, of course, indispensable.
    However, "praise targets" are not like that. "Praise targets" are targets set by some railway train sections for train attendants, referring to the number of letters of commendation a train attendant should receive each month. Since it's a target, it must constantly increase to demonstrate the development of work. Therefore, some train sections set the "praise target" at 300 commendation letters this month, and increase it to 1,000 next month.
    Train sections provide services for passengers. Passengers' praise or criticism is indeed a sign of the quality of service; the number of commendation letters also reflects the performance of the train section to some extent. However, no matter how good the service quality of the train attendants, commendation letters always have to be written by the passengers. Passengers who want to commend may not all be literate or able to write commendation letters; literate passengers who can write commendation letters have neither the obligation nor the responsibility to write them, and even if they have feelings of gratitude, they may not all write commendation letters. Even the train attendant with the best service attitude often receives commendation letters, truly "easily obtained"; but to list this as a target, requiring a certain number of commendation letters each month, is truly "searching high and low without finding it." Isn't the lack of basis for "praise targets" very obvious?
    However, despite the lack of basis, there are repeated calls to complete it. What to do? The train attendants have to find tricks on their own. First, there is a distinction in service recipients. Elderly farmers with poor eyesight and peasant women carrying babies, although most in need of care, are ignored at first glance because they appear to be illiterate, and it is difficult to obtain commendation letters no matter how good the service is; cadres and students, with pens in their pockets, must be literate and reasonable, and are treated differently. Second, even if they are treated differently, passengers may not think of writing commendation letters, so they hand over suggestion books, plus inspiration: "Please use this suggestion book more often, and you can also write about good deeds." Third, what if they still don't write? It's better to write a few letters praising yourself.
    This is the result of setting "praise targets."
    In addition to "praise targets," there are targets for killing rats, targets for catching sparrows, and targets for the number of advanced producers reaching 70% of the total number of employees. I dare not say that there are true "target fanatics," but some people do like to use targets to replace leadership work. They set targets at the beginning of the month and check them at the end of the month; those who complete them are praised, and those who do not complete them are criticized. It is truly a complete cycle, with rewards and punishments, and the leadership can be said to be "skillful." However, they have forgotten that not all work can be measured by targets, and therefore not all targets are necessary. Unnecessary targets such as "praise targets" can only lead the enthusiasm of the masses in the wrong direction and spoil things.

### “表扬指标”

    “表扬指标”
    柯月霖
    “表扬指标”是怎么回事，读者们恐怕有些费解吧！
    这是铁路上的事。
    指标，如厂矿企业中的产量指标，上缴利润指标等等，顾名思义指的是有具体数字的目标。有了指标，工人们在生产中就有了奋斗的方向，领导部门就有了可以据以检查工作好坏的标准。这些指标当然是不可缺少的。
    然而，“表扬指标”却不是这么回事。“表扬指标”是有些铁路上的列车段为列车员订的指标，指的是列车员每个月应该收到多少表扬信。既然是指标，当然要不断增长，才足以显示工作的发展，因而有些列车段这个月的“表扬指标”是三百件表扬信，下个月就增加到一千件。
    列车段做的是为旅客服务的工作。旅客的表扬或批评，确实是服务质量好坏的一种标志；表扬信的多寡在一定程度上也体现了列车段成绩的好坏。可是，列车员的服务质量再好，表扬信总是要旅客来写的。想表扬的旅客不一定都识字、都会写表扬信；识字的、会写表扬信的旅客，既没有非写表扬信不可的义务和责任，即便是心怀感激之情，也未必都来写表扬信。即便是服务态度最好的列车员，他经常会接到旅客的表扬信，真是“得来全不费功夫”；但把这列为指标，每个月非要接到多少表扬信不可，却又确实“踏破铁鞋无处寻”。“表扬指标”之无根据，岂不是很明显的吗？
    然而，尽管没有根据，偏偏还是再三号召必须完成。怎么办呢？列车员们只得分头找窍门。首先，服务对象有了区别。老眼昏花的农民，怀抱婴儿的农妇，虽然最需要照顾，无奈一眼看去，像是不识字的，服务再好，也难获表扬信，只得撇开不管；干部、学生，胸插钢笔，必通文理，就另眼看待。其次，另眼看待了，旅客未必都想起写表扬信，于是便递上意见簿，外加启发：“请多多使用这个意见簿，发现好的事迹也可以写上。”再次，要是还不写怎么办？不如自己动手写几封表扬自己的信来得干脆。
    这就是订“表扬指标”的结果。
    除了“表扬指标”外，有订打老鼠指标的，有订捉麻雀指标的，有订先进生产者人数必须达到全体职工总数70％的指标的。不敢说真有“指标迷”，但确实有人喜欢用指标来代替领导工作。他们月初订指标，月末来检查；完成的表扬，没有完成的批评。真是有始有终，有奖有惩，领导可称得上“有方”了。只是，他们忘记了并不是任何工作都可以用指标来权衡的，因而并不是任何指标都是必要的。诸如“表扬指标”之类不必要的指标，只能把群众的热情引导到错误的方面去，把事情办坏。
