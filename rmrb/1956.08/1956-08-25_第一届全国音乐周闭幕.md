Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The closing ceremony of the First National Music Week was held today at the Beijing Concert Hall.

    Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui spoke first. He praised the achievements of the Music Week, expressed gratitude and congratulations to all music workers on behalf of the Ministry of Culture, and encouraged music workers to work harder and unite more closely to make significant contributions to the cause of Chinese people's music.
    Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, said: This Music Week has gathered the main forces of the national music circles and performed the main works of music creation in recent years; it has also performed some representative works since the "May Fourth" Movement. We heard the creative and excellent performances of folk musicians from various places; we also heard national classical music with a long history and high artistic level, and thanks to the creativity of the performers, these ancient instruments have been newly developed. Many musicians from more than a dozen brotherly ethnic groups traveled thousands of miles to participate in the performances. During the Music Week, the music circles also exchanged opinions on music creation in recent years. Lü Ji said: This Music Week truly embodies the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and will have a significant impact on the development of music art in the future.
    Vice Minister of Culture Liu Zhiming delivered the closing speech. He said: This Music Week performed works including various eras, various themes, various forms and styles, thus showing that the music circles have paid more attention to our country's national, folk, and classical music heritage; works that use European music forms, techniques, and instruments to express the lives of modern Chinese people have made obvious progress in the pursuit of national style; the music of all ethnic groups has also been improved. The Music Week also showed the new achievements of the older generation of musicians and the talents of the younger generation. Liu Zhiming pointed out that in the future, we should pay special attention to our musical traditions, better learn from our musical traditions, and strive to master them so that they can be carried forward under new conditions. The new people's music culture can only be better developed and prospered on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward national traditions and critically absorbing foreign music as nourishment and reference. Liu Zhiming pointed out that in the future, we should also further introduce outstanding foreign music culture, and better learn and master foreign music's advanced theories and excellent techniques, which is beneficial to meeting the needs of the people in many ways and developing our country's music culture. However, when using foreign music forms, techniques, and instruments to express the lives of the Chinese people, we should strive to nationalize and popularize it. Liu Zhiming also asked music workers to go deep into life and deep into the people, to create and perform more and better works reflecting the lives and struggles of our people; to excavate, study and sort out national and folk music heritage on a larger scale and more systematically. Music workers should give more care and guidance to the amateur music activities of the masses. He called on all music workers to unite more closely, under the guidance of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," to do their best, express their opinions freely, and work together to promote the prosperity of our country's music industry.
    The Music Week, which lasted for twenty-four days, came to a successful conclusion.

    第一届全国音乐周闭幕
    新华社24日讯　第一届全国音乐周的闭幕式今天在北京音乐堂举行。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞首先讲话，他表扬了音乐周的成就，代表文化部向全体音乐工作者表示感谢和祝贺，并且鼓励音乐工作者更加努力、更加团结，对中国人民音乐事业作出重大贡献。
    中国音乐家协会主席吕骥讲话说：这届音乐周聚集了全国音乐界的主要力量，表演了近几年来音乐创作的主要作品；也表演了“五四”以来一些有代表性的作品。听到了各地民间音乐家富有创造性的优秀表演；也听到了具有悠久历史和高度艺术水平的民族古典音乐，由于演奏家的创造，使这些古老的乐器得到了新的发展。包括十多个兄弟民族的许多音乐家跋涉几千里赶来参加了表演。音乐周举行期间音乐界还对几年来的音乐创作交换了意见。吕骥说：这届音乐周真正体现了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，对今后音乐艺术的发展会产生重大影响。
    文化部副部长刘芝明致闭幕词。他说：这次音乐周演出了包括各个时代、各种题材、各种形式和风格的作品，从而显示了音乐界对我国民族、民间和古典音乐遗产有了更多的注意；运用欧洲音乐形式、技巧和乐器来表现现代中国人民生活的作品，在追求民族风格方面有了明显的进步；各民族的音乐也都有了提高。音乐周也显示了老一辈音乐家新的成就和青年一代的才华，刘芝明指出，今后应当特别重视我们的音乐传统，更好地向我们的音乐传统学习，努力去掌握它，使它在新的条件下发扬光大。新的人民音乐文化，只有在继承和发扬民族传统的基础上，批判地吸收外国的音乐作为养料和借鉴，才能更好地发展、繁荣。刘芝明指出，今后也应当进一步介绍外国优秀的音乐文化，并且更好地学习和掌握外国音乐的先进理论和优良技巧，这对于多方面地满足人民需要和发展我国的音乐文化是有益处的。但在运用外国的音乐形式、技巧和乐器来表现中国人民的生活时，应当努力使它民族化、群众化。刘芝明还要求音乐工作者深入生活、深入民间，更好、更多地创作和演出反映我国人民生活与斗争的作品；更大规模、更系统地发掘、研究和整理民族、民间音乐遗产。音乐工作者应给群众业余音乐活动更大的关心和指导。他要求全体音乐工作者更加团结，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针指导下，各尽所能，各抒己见，共同为繁荣我国的音乐事业奋斗。
    历时二十四天的音乐周至此胜利结束。
