Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Feng Jian and Yao Changgan report: The construction project of the famous Daye Iron Mine, which started on August 15th last year, has now been underway for a full year. This mining area, originally surrounded by quiet mountains, is now seething with the labor enthusiasm of thousands of mine builders day and night.

According to historical records, the Daye Iron Mine began mining in 227 AD and has a history of more than 1,700 years. However, only in the past year has the face of the Daye Iron Mine area undergone fundamental changes. The mining stripping projects of Pointed Mountain and Lion Mountain in the eastern mining area have been fully mechanized. Powerful heavy-duty electric shovels, drilling machines, and heroic blasting workers remove an average of two to three thousand cubic meters of hard rock from the top of the mountain every day. Thousands of large dump trucks speed back and forth along the mountain road that winds around the mountain like a belt. Since the start of construction a year ago, the mine builders have removed the grass-covered summit of Pointed Mountain, creating a wide construction site. The peak of Lion Mountain has also been shaved off by more than half. The reddish-brown ore body at the highest point is now exposed on Pointed Mountain. At night, the mine resembles a bustling, sleepless city. The symphony of electric shovels, drilling machines, and dump trucks echoes through the valley, and the bright electric lights on the top of the mountain shine against the stars in the night sky.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese imperialists plundered a large amount of ore from the Daye Iron Mine. Now, the mine builders have dismantled the barbed wire left on the mountain by the invaders and erected a dense network of power transmission lines; they have used the newly stripped rocks to fill in some of the damaged old mine pits.

More than a month ago, construction of the mine's artery—the electrified railway—began. The builders stripped away the white marble in the mountainside and began to build stations and lines. The terrain in the road construction area is rugged and complex. On a steep mountainside, the builders will build thirteen layers of lines stacked up and down, so that future electric locomotives can climb up the high mountain in a zigzag pattern. This electrified railway is connected to the Wuchang-Daye railway, which is under construction. In the future, trains loaded with ore will be able to travel from the Daye Iron Mine area to the iron smelting area of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise. In addition, the construction preparations for the mine's mechanical repair facilities, substations, and other projects have also begun. The person in charge of Daye Iron Mine told reporters that the builders are determined to accelerate mine construction to ensure the future need for ore of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise.

With the construction of the mine, the quiet mountain village at the foot of the mountains has gradually become a new town in the past year. People from all over the country have come here to build the mine and settled down, doubling the population. The people's government has built a new batch of employee residences, shops, a primary school, a cinema, and a hospital, and opened five major roads. Two hectares of workers' housing and the Workers' Cultural Palace at the foot of Lucang Mountain, as well as the Tieshan Middle School, are also under construction. Recently, a new dairy farm has been established in the mining area, and the mine builders will soon be able to drink fresh milk.

    大冶铁矿区建设加速进行
    尖山露出赤褐色矿体，狮子山峰已削去大半
    工地和山村如同闹市，电气化铁路开始施工
    新华社武汉16日电　新华社记者冯健、姚昌淦报道：著名的大冶铁矿建设工程，从去年八月十五日开工，到现在整整一年了。这个原是寂静的群山环抱的矿区，现在日夜沸腾着数千名矿山建设者的劳动热情。
    据历史资料记载，大冶铁矿从公元二二七年就开始开采，迄今已有一千七百多年历史。但是，只是在过去的一年里，大冶铁矿区的面貌才发生了根本的变化。东部矿区尖山、狮子山两座山的采矿剥离工程，已经全面展开了机械化施工。威力强大的重型电铲、穿孔机和英雄的爆破手们，每天平均要从山顶上剥去两、三千立方公尺坚硬的岩石。数千辆大型自卸汽车，沿着像带子一样盘山而上的登山公路，往返疾驰。开工一年来，矿山建设者已经铲掉了青草复盖的尖山山顶，开拓成宽阔的施工场面：狮子山的山峰也已被削去了大半个。最高处的赤褐色的矿体，现在已经在尖山上袒露出来。夜晚，矿山像一座不眠的闹市，电铲、穿孔机和自卸汽车等机械声响组成的交响乐曲，响彻山谷，山顶上灿烂的电灯和夜空的繁星交相辉映。
    抗日战争时期，日本帝国主义者曾经掠夺了大冶铁矿的大批矿石。现在，矿山建设者们拆掉了强盗们留在山上的铁丝网，架起了密如蛛网的输电线路；用新剥下来的岩石填平了一些残破的旧矿坑。
    一个多月以前，矿区的动脉——电气化铁路开始施工了。建设者们剥开了山腰里洁白的大理岩，开始修筑车站、线路等。筑路区的地形崎岖复杂，在一个陡峭的山腰上，建筑者们将要上下叠筑十三层线路，使将来的电气机车走“之”字形爬上高山。这条电气化铁路和正在修建的武昌—大冶铁路相接，将来满载矿石的列车，就可以源源从大冶铁矿区驶往武汉钢铁联合企业的炼铁区。此外，矿区的机械修理设施、变电所等项工程，也已经开始了施工准备工作。大冶铁矿的负责人对记者说，建设者们都决心加速矿山建设，以便保证武汉钢铁联合企业将来对矿石的需要。
    随着矿山的建设，这里群山脚下僻静的山村，一年来已经逐渐变成一个新兴的市镇。从全国各地前来建设矿山的人们，在这里定居下来，人口增加了一倍。人民政府在这里新建筑了一批职工住宅、商店和一座小学校、电影院、医院，开辟了五条大马路。正在动工兴建的还有两万平方公尺工人住宅和鹿樟山山麓的工人文化宫、铁山中学校舍。最近，矿区又新设了奶牛场，矿山建设者们不久后将能喝到新鲜的牛奶了。
