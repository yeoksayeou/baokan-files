    Anshan Steel Owed Us Seventy-Two Tons of Light Rail
    On March 16th of this year, our Bureau and Anshan Iron and Steel Company signed a contract under which Anshan Steel would supply forty-two tons of 15 kg steel rails and thirty tons of 11 kg steel rails, with delivery scheduled for June. These light rails are urgently needed for our Bureau's capital construction projects and production. After signing the contract, we waited for delivery. Unexpectedly, June came and went without any goods being delivered, so we sent a special person to Anshan Steel to urge them. At that time, they promised to deliver the goods in July. By early July, there were still no goods, so we sent a telegram to urge them again. On July 19th, they replied by telegram agreeing to deliver the goods, but still no goods arrived by July 21st. At this point, the need for steel rails underground was even more pressing, so we sent another special person to inquire. On July 23rd, the company's sales department flatly replied that the light rails owed for the second quarter would not be delivered. Their irresponsible attitude toward the supply contract has seriously affected our Bureau's capital construction projects and production tasks. We demand that Anshan Iron and Steel Company promptly issue the seventy-two tons of light rail owed.

    鞍钢欠我们七十二吨轻轨
    今年三月十六日，我局和鞍山钢铁公司签订了一项由鞍钢供应十五公斤的钢轨四十二吨，十一公斤的钢轨三十吨的合同，议定在六月份交货。这些轻轨都是我局基本建设工程和生产上急需的。订立合同之后，我们就等着交货。谁知到六月份，并不见有货交来，我们就派专人到鞍钢去督催。当时他们答应，七月份一定补交。到了七月初旬，仍不见有货来，我们又用电报催，七月十九日他们来电报答复同意交货，但直到七月二十一日，仍没有货来。这时井下需用钢轨更加迫切，我们又派专人去催问，到了七月二十三日，这个公司的推销处竟断然答复说：第二季度所欠的轻轨一律不再补交。他们用这种不负责任的态度来对待供货合同，已严重影响我局的基本建设工程和生产任务，我们要求鞍山钢铁公司迅速补发所欠七十二吨轻轨。
