    The Time for Creation
    Jian Xian'ai
    At the expanded meeting of the Second Council of the Chinese Writers Association, Comrade Ba Jin made an earnest appeal: "Let a person engaged in creation have sufficient time, at least enough time to pick up a pen and write some words, and also have time for brewing and thinking before picking up the pen." This is an earnest appeal, representing the common opinions of many writers. Let me also tell a little story: We have a very talented writer here who has been engaged in administrative work for several years since liberation, so his creative output has naturally been less. He was only transferred out this year. But for the past six months, he has still been busy attending and chairing a series of important meetings. Although he has nominally become a creative cadre, he is currently unable to go down to experience life and engage in creation; on the one hand, his ideas are often interrupted by meetings, making it difficult to concentrate, and his imaginative thinking has also encountered difficulties. He has had to temporarily take time out to study some world literary masterpieces (everyone must admit that this is a pragmatic approach). However, some comrades do not understand his situation and immediately reach out to him for things, and even inevitably make some accusations. This writer, of course, felt great pressure. Some people even equate literary works with general news reports in newspapers, demanding that he write as quickly and as much as journalists do: they simply regard creation as an easy task.

  　It is entirely right for the masses to make urgent demands on writers; but we must also fully recognize the characteristics of literature. Literature uses language to create images, types, and characters, and uses language to reflect reality, natural scenes, and thinking (Gorky), through which it educates and transforms the people. It is an extremely meticulous and precise work, which cannot be done without deep thought and consideration. Therefore, the time requirement must be set longer. I believe that even if a writer has already finalized his creative plan, the leadership should provide more assistance and allow him to revise and supplement it at any time based on the actual situation of his own life practice and creative practice, and can also extend the time for completion, and not mechanically restrict his plan to be unchangeable. When dealing with literary creation, the impatient mentality of "reaching success in one leap" cannot solve the problem.

    However, from the writer's own point of view, "Once the year passes, how can it be recovered!" One should better strive for time and seize the time to write some works full of socialist and communist ideas for the broad masses of people; on the basis of being both good and economical, one should write more and faster. Could it be said that in today's hot socialist upsurge, and under the encouragement of the "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, we still feel that there is nothing to write about? This will never be the case.

    It is not only unobjectionable for writers to demand ample time to write, but all parties should vigorously support it (the Chinese Writers Association has already taken some specific measures in this regard). However, there are also some individuals engaged in creation who lack political enthusiasm and are unwilling to go deep into life and struggle, resulting in lax labor discipline, but use the excuse of lacking time for creation, while in reality they often squander precious time in idle pursuits. We should also launch stern criticism against them.

    创作的时间
    蹇先艾
    在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上，巴金同志提出了：“让一个从事创作的人有充分的时间，至少也得有拿起笔写完若干字的时间，而且也得有执笔以前的酝酿、思索的时间。”这是一个情词恳切的呼吁，代表了很多作家共同的意见。我也来讲一个小故事：我们这里有一位很有才能的作家，解放几年来一直都担任着行政工作，创作自然就比较少了一些。今年才抽调出来。但半年来他仍忙于出席和主持一系列的重要会议。名义上尽管已经变成了一个创作干部，目前他还无法下去体验生活，进行创作；一方面由于他的构思常常被会议所打断，一时不易集中起来，形象思维也就遇到了困难，他只好暂时抽空钻研一些世界文学名著（谁也得承认这是一种实事求是的做法）。不过有一些同志对他的处境却并不理解，马上就伸出手来向他要东西，还不免有所责难。这位作家当然感到了很大的压力。有的人甚至于把文艺作品和报纸上一般的通讯、报道等同起来，要求他写得像记者同志们那样快，那样多：他们简直把创作看成了轻而易举的事情。
  　群众对作家提出迫切的要求是完全应该的；只是我们也得充分认识文学的特点。文学是用语言来创造形象、典型和性格，用语言来反映现实、自然景象和思维（高尔基），通过它来教育人民和改造人民的。它是一个极其细致、精密的工作，缺少了深思熟虑便办不到。因此，时间的要求，必须放得长远一些。我认为即使一个作家已经定好了他的创作计划，领导上也应该多多帮助并允许他依据他自己的生活实践和创作实践的实际情况随时加以修订和增补，也可以延长完稿的时间，不要机械地限制他的计划一成不变。对待文艺创作，“一蹴即至”的急躁情绪是不能解决问题的。
    但是从作家自己来说，“年一过往，何可攀援！”就应该更好地争取时间，抓紧时间给广大人民写出一些富有社会主义、共产主义思想的作品；在又好又省的基础上，就应该写得多一点，快一点。难道说在今天热火朝天的社会主义高潮下，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针的鼓舞下，我们还会觉得没有什么东西可写吗？这是决不会的。
    作家要求有充裕的时间来写作，不但是无可非议，而且各方面都应大力予以支持（中国作家协会在这方面已作了一些具体措施）。但是也有个别从事创作的人，自己的政治热情不高，又不肯深入生活斗争，以致劳动纪律废弛，却借口于缺乏创作的时间，而实际上往往把宝贵的光阴在不务正业中虚掷浪费，我们同时也应当对他们展开严正的批评。
