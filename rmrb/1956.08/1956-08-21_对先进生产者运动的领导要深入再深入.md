    The Leadership of the Advanced Producer Movement Needs to be Deepened Further
    Since the launch of the advanced producer movement across the country, the socialist enthusiasm of the workers has been unprecedented, and the production morale is very high. Now, on the surface, the movement may not be as vigorous as it was at the beginning of the year, and the number of rationalization proposals may not be as many as in the first quarter, but the activities of workers in learning technology and promoting advanced experience have become common and regular in many enterprises. The representatives who came to Beijing to participate in the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference brought back hundreds and thousands of advanced experiences, which the workers eagerly learned and practiced; some did not even wait for the enterprise leaders to make plans before the masses spontaneously promoted them. "Learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths to offset weaknesses, and improving together" has become a common practice.
    In this situation, if production leaders truly, specifically, and deeply lead the advanced producer movement, the enthusiasm of the masses can be fully utilized, production can be truly improved, and the national plan can be well completed; if production leaders do not deeply lead the advanced producer movement, but only make general appeals, do not systematically summarize and promote advanced experiences based on specific circumstances, and do not strive to improve management work to create favorable conditions for the continued development of the movement, then the labor enthusiasm of the workers will decline, advanced experiences will not be promoted, production will be difficult to improve, and the national plan will not be well completed.
    How should the leadership of the advanced producer movement be deepened?
    One of the main methods of in-depth leadership is to conduct investigation and research to discover weak links in production. Not only should we find major problems affecting production, but also minor problems affecting production, so as to find, summarize, and promote advanced experiences in a targeted manner, concentrate the wisdom of workers and engineering and technical personnel, study specific measures to solve the problems, and actively implement them. Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Dahua Rubber Factory adopted the method of conducting investigation and research from workshop to work section, and from work section to work team, and found the key to poor tire quality, analyzed eight problems in operation, fifteen problems in equipment, and two problems in the system; at the same time, in finding weak links, they also found advanced figures and advanced experiences, adopted the method of combining labor and technology, specially organized a technical research group, researched 29 measures, summarized 12 advanced experiences, and put forward 12 rationalization proposal topics targeting the key problems. In this way, after repeatedly promoting advanced experiences and implementing technical measures, the tire quality of this factory, which originally did not meet the national standards, has now met them. The advanced producer movement in this factory has taken a step forward, and production has also improved a step.
    An important method of in-depth leadership is to specifically help backward units and backward workers reach advanced levels. This is a very meticulous organizational work. It is wrong to simply blame backward units and backward workers without specific analysis, or to take simple punishment measures. We should specifically analyze the reasons for backwardness, give comradely care, and promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and take concrete measures to raise the backward to the advanced level. Factory 53 summarized an experience in this regard: mobilizing backward workers must combine political encouragement, care in life, and technical assistance. This experience is very good. Many enterprises in Shanghai, under the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized caring for people and doing people's work well, and the improvement of production has been guaranteed. Some enterprises organize workers to voluntarily combine and sign mutual assistance contracts (brother contracts, sister contracts, master-apprentice contracts) to enable advanced producers and ordinary producers to carry out technical mutual assistance. This method is very popular among the workers and has quickly achieved the effect of common improvement. This method of signing mutual assistance contracts can also be adopted between advanced enterprises and backward enterprises. For example, in the Shanghai wool textile industry, state-owned advanced factories have signed mutual assistance contracts with newly established public-private joint venture backward small factories; with the help of advanced factories, the product quality of small factories has been improved from being far from the national standards to being close to the national standards, and at the same time, advanced factories have also learned some advanced experiences from small factories.
    In-depth leadership must also be combined with mobilizing engineering and technical personnel and management personnel, and improving enterprise management work. Since the launch of the advanced producer movement, a prominent contradiction is that enterprise management work cannot keep up with the development of the mass movement. Some enterprise leaders regard strengthening planning management and technical management as purely administrative work, and the various measures taken are not only not discussed with the workers, but also do not adopt the opinions of engineering and technical personnel and management personnel. Some enterprise leaders believe that promoting advanced experience is the work of the trade union, and the administration only entrusts one or two cadres to "cooperate" with it; and some trade union organizations have not mobilized engineering and technical personnel and management personnel to participate in the advanced producer movement. These are all bad. We should organize engineering and technical personnel and management personnel to carry out office work competitions, mobilize them to go deep into the workshops to create favorable working conditions for the workers, so as to improve production and ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan.
    Production leaders need to be highly sensitive to new things, and they must have a mass viewpoint, believe in the wisdom of the masses, and learn from the masses. Only in this way can we discover, summarize, and promote the advanced experiences of the masses. Enterprise leaders should not only learn from the production workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management personnel of their own factories, but also from the workers of other factories. Only by breaking the narrow-mindedness of isolation and self-importance, and overcoming the shortcomings of arrogance and complacency, can the production of our enterprises catch up with the advanced level and continue to move forward. Dalian Steel Plant used to be a long-term backward enterprise, but in this advanced producer movement, the leaders established the idea of relying on the masses and striving to learn and catch up with advanced enterprises. They not only attached importance to and summarized the advanced experiences of the workers in their own factories, but also when they knew that any factory had a good experience, they took the initiative to send workshop directors, technicians, and production workers to learn, and according to the specific situation of their own enterprises, they formulated practical and feasible methods to implement them, so in the first quarter of this year, they comprehensively completed the national plan, and many economic and technical indicators reached or approached the domestic advanced level.
    Facts have proved that the leadership of the advanced producer movement must be deepened step by step, and there must be no complacency. Those that have already been deepened must be deepened further; at the same time, the daily leadership of enterprises must also be deepened step by step, so that the advanced producer movement of enterprises can be carried out well, and the production plans of enterprises can be completed well.

### 对先进生产者运动的领导要深入再深入

    对先进生产者运动的领导要深入再深入
    全国各地开展先进生产者运动以来，职工群众的社会主义积极性是空前高涨的，生产情绪是很饱满的。现在，从表面上看，运动也许没有年初那样轰轰烈烈，合理化建议件数也没有第一季度多，但是职工群众那种学习技术、推广先进经验的活动，在许多企业里都已经成为普遍的经常的事情了。到北京来参加全国先进生产者代表会议的代表们，带回去成百上千条的先进经验，职工群众如获至宝地争相传习；有的还没有等到企业领导者做出计划，群众就自发地推广了。“互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高”已经成为普遍的风气。
    在这种情况下，如果生产领导者对先进生产者运动真正具体深入地进行领导，群众的积极性就能充分发挥作用，生产也能真正提高，国家计划也就完成得好；如果生产领导者对先进生产者运动的领导不深入，只是作一般号召，不根据具体情况有计划有步骤地总结和推广先进经验，不努力改进管理工作，为运动的继续发展创造有利的条件，那末，职工群众的劳动热情就会低落，先进经验就不能推广，生产也就难以提高，国家计划也就完成得不好。
    对先进生产者运动的领导需要怎样深入呢？
    深入领导的主要方法之一是进行调查研究，发现生产中的薄弱环节。不仅要找到影响生产的大问题，而且要找到影响生产的小问题，从而针对这些问题，有目的地去发现、总结和推广先进经验，集中工人和工程技术人员的智慧，研究出解决问题的具体措施，积极加以实现。上海公私合营大中华橡胶一厂采取了从车间到工段、从工段到工班的层层调查研究的方法，找到了轮胎质量不好的关键，分析了操作方面的八个问题、设备方面的十五个问题、制度方面的两个问题；同时在找薄弱环节中，又找到了先进人物和先进经验，采用劳动与技术结合的办法，专门组织了技术研究组，研究出二十九项措施，总结了十二项先进经验，而且针对着关键问题提出了十二个合理化建议课题。这样，经过了反复推广先进经验，贯彻执行了技术措施，原来这个厂的轮胎质量达不到国家指标，现在达到了。这个厂的先进生产者运动就深入了一步，生产也提高了一步。
    深入领导的一个重要方法是具体帮助落后单位和落后工人达到先进水平。这是一件非常细致的组织工作。对待落后单位和落后工人不加具体分析，只是一味责备，或者采取简单的惩罚办法，那是不对的。应该具体分析落后的原因，给予同志式的关怀，并且发扬互助精神，采取具体措施，把落后的提高到先进的水平。五三工厂在这方面总结了一条经验：发动落后工人必须是政治上鼓励、生活上关怀、技术上帮助三方面结合。这条经验是很好的。上海市不少企业在中共上海市委指示下，强调了关心人，做好人的工作，生产的提高也就有了保证。有些企业组织职工之间自愿结合，签订互助合同（兄弟合同、姊妹合同、师徒合同），使先进生产者和普通生产者实行技术互助。这个办法很受职工群众的欢迎，而且迅速收到了共同提高的效果。这种签订互助合同的办法，在先进企业和落后企业之间也可以采用。如在上海毛纺织业中，国营的先进厂就同新近实行公私合营的落后小厂签订了互助合同；在先进厂帮助下，小厂的产品质量由过去距离国家指标很远，提高到与国家指标相近，同时先进厂也在小厂中学习到某些先进经验。
    深入领导还必须同发动工程技术人员和管理人员、改进企业管理工作结合起来。先进生产者运动开展以来，一个突出的矛盾是企业管理工作跟不上群众运动的发展。有些企业领导者把加强计划管理和技术管理只看作单纯的行政工作，采取各种措施不仅不同工人群众商量，也不采纳工程技术人员和管理人员的意见。有些企业领导者认为推广先进经验是工会的事情，行政上只委托一两个干事“配合”一下就算完事；而有的工会组织也没有去发动工程技术人员和管理人员参加先进生产者运动。这些都是不好的。应该组织工程技术人员、管理人员开展科室工作竞赛，动员他们深入车间，为工人创造有利的工作条件，以提高生产，保证全面完成国家计划。
    生产领导者需要对新鲜事物有高度敏感，并且要有群众观点，相信群众的智慧，向群众学习。这样才能够发现、总结和推广群众的先进经验。企业领导者不仅要向本厂生产工人、工程技术人员、管理人员学习，同时还要向外厂的职工群众学习。只有打破闭关自守、夜郎自大的狭隘思想，克服骄傲自满、自恃聪明的毛病，才能使本企业的生产赶上先进的水平，并且不断前进。大连钢厂过去曾是一个长期落后的企业，但是在这次开展先进生产者运动中，领导者树立了依靠群众和努力学习、向先进企业看齐的思想，他们不仅重视和总结了本厂职工的先进经验，而且当他们知道哪一个厂有一点好的经验的时候，就主动地派车间主任、技术人员、生产工人去学习，并且把学回来的经验，根据自己企业的具体情况，订出切实可行的办法，加以贯彻执行，因而今年第一季度全面完成了国家计划，许多经济技术指标达到或接近国内的先进水平。
    事实证明：对先进生产者运动的领导必须步步深入，不能有丝毫自满，已经深入的，还要再求深入；同时，企业的日常领导也必须步步深入，企业的先进生产者运动才能开展得好，企业的生产计划也才能完成得好。
