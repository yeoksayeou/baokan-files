The visit to China by the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Delegation, respectively composed of representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors of Singapore and Malaya, is a new event in the growing economic cooperation between Asian countries. This is the first time that Singapore and Malaya have sent trade delegations to China. This will not only help promote trade between China and Singapore and Malaya but will also make a beneficial contribution to enhancing friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of both sides.

The visit to China by the Singapore and Malaya trade delegations has received enthusiastic support from local business circles. Singapore originally planned to organize a delegation of only 20 to 30 people, but after the news spread, the number of applicants greatly exceeded the original plan, and the quota had to be expanded, resulting in a delegation of more than 60 people. The Minister of Commerce of Malaya also stated that the Malayan government would encourage any efforts to expand trade with China. The press and industrial and commercial circles in Singapore and Malaya have high hopes for the visit of the two trade delegations to China, hoping to pave the way for the development of trade relations between Singapore, Malaya, and China.

Singapore and Malaya produce more than 600,000 tons of rubber and more than 60,000 tons of tin annually, almost all of which is exported. Other products such as iron sand, copra, coconut oil, canned pineapples, and timber are also largely dependent on exports. However, the two places lack food and must import rice, while other items such as cloth, food, beverages, light industrial daily necessities, machinery, steel, and building materials need to be imported from abroad. At the same time, Singapore is a transit center in Southeast Asia, and the more entrepot trade, the more prosperous the economy. Therefore, foreign trade has a significant impact on the economic life of Singapore and Malaya.

The production and sales situation of natural rubber, which is the main pillar of the Singapore and Malaya economy, has not been optimistic this year and is unlikely to become so in the future. Rubber accounts for 67% of the agricultural cultivated area in Malaya, 55% of the total export value, and 30% of the labor force. The rise and fall of rubber prices not only affects the interests of large and small planters and operators, and the lives of rubber workers, but also has a great relationship with the overall economic prosperity of Malaya and the financial revenue of the two governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Since January of this year, the price of natural rubber has continued to fall. The price of Singapore No. 1 smoked rubber sheet was 32.47 pence per pound in January, 27.20 pence in March, 23.71 pence in May, and further fell to 20.76 pence on June 1, which is already lower than the level of 22.95 pence when the Korean War began in June 1950. In addition to factors such as the reduction in automobile production in the United States, which has led to a decline in rubber consumption in the capitalist world, another major reason is that major rubber-consuming countries such as the United States and Britain have greatly developed the production of synthetic rubber, posing a serious threat to the sales and prices of natural rubber. In 1955, the capitalist world consumed 2.77 million tons of rubber (including 1.72 million tons of natural rubber), of which the United States accounted for 1.53 million tons (including 630,000 tons of natural rubber). US President Eisenhower said in his report to Congress that US rubber consumption will reach 1.7 million tons by 1960, but US synthetic rubber production had already reached 1.25 million tons by the end of 1955. It is estimated that synthetic rubber production can reach 1.7 million tons by January 1958. This means that between the summer and autumn of 1957, the United States may no longer need to purchase natural rubber from abroad and may export large quantities of synthetic rubber to compete with natural rubber for the market. In addition to purchasing 70,000 tons of synthetic rubber from the United States, Britain has also been developing synthetic rubber production, with an output of 50,000 tons expected in 1958. This situation created by the United States and Britain cannot but cause Singapore and Malaya to feel serious concern about the future of selling natural rubber. Not only that, but before June of this year, Singapore and Malayan rubber were restricted by embargoes and could not be exported to China, losing the Chinese market, looking forward to the future, it could not but increase the worries of the people and business circles in Singapore and Malaya. Therefore, on June 4 of this year, the governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya simultaneously adopted measures to lift the rubber "embargo," which was immediately welcomed and supported by all parties in Singapore and Malaya, which is completely understandable.

As for China, the Chinese government and people have always advocated developing trade relations and friendship with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. With the development of China's economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, China's need for rubber will continue to grow. China, of course, welcomes Singapore and Malaya's measures to lift the rubber embargo. China is willing to continue to purchase rubber from other rubber-producing countries according to its own needs and at fair and reasonable prices, and is also willing to purchase rubber from Singapore and Malaya to develop trade relations between China and Singapore and Malaya.

There are many commodities that can be exchanged between China and Singapore and Malaya. In addition to rubber, China also needs to import tin, coconut oil, timber, and other products produced in Malaya. On the export side of China, not only can China supply a large amount of various foods, vegetables, native products, silk, tea, cotton knitwear, etc. needed by Singapore and Malaya, but in the past year or two, various light industrial products in China have also established a good reputation in the Singapore and Malaya markets, and are widely welcomed for their fair prices and excellent quality. In July of this year, Chinese commodities were exhibited in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, and were generally praised by visitors. Chinese cotton cloth is considered to "shine in the Singapore and Malaya markets, winning the favor of general customers with four major characteristics: sufficient length, bright colors, never fading, and low prices." Chinese industrial and agricultural products, such as various building materials, paper, mimeographs, pens, pianos, sewing machines, bicycles, radios, medicines, enamelware, fishing nets, umbrellas, Fujian lacquerware, Lingnan famous fruits, various famous wines, famous teas, various canned foods, etc., numbering no less than several hundred kinds, are welcomed by residents and business circles in Singapore and Malaya. According to Malayan customs statistics, the total value of Chinese commodities imported by Singapore and Malaya in 1955 was approximately US$35 million. These commodities are not only needed and loved by local residents in Singapore and Malaya, but also increased a lot of income for Singapore's entrepot trade. Obviously, continuing to develop bilateral trade on the existing basis is very beneficial to both sides. We believe that through the visit of the Singapore and Malaya trade delegations, both sides will certainly discover many new commodities that can be exchanged.

The Singapore and Malaya industrial and commercial trade delegations are not only trade delegations, but also friendship delegations of the industrial and commercial circles and people of Singapore and Malaya. We hope that through the visit of the Singapore and Malaya trade delegations, the trade relations between Singapore, Malaya, and China will be further developed, and the friendship between the peoples of both sides will be further consolidated and enhanced.

    中国和新加坡、马来亚发展贸易的前途
    陆明
    这次由新加坡、马来亚工商界代表分别组成的新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业考察团到我国来访问，是亚洲国家间日益发展的经济合作关系中的新事件。新加坡和马来亚两地派遣贸易代表团到我国来，这还是第一次。这不但有助于促进我国和新加坡、马来亚之间的贸易来往，也将对增进双方人民之间的友谊和相互了解作出有益的贡献。
    新加坡、马来亚贸易考察团的来华，得到当地工商界人士的热烈支持。新加坡原来只打算组织一个二十至三十人的代表团，但消息传出后，报名参加的人数大大超过原定计划，结果不得不扩大名额，成为一个六十余人的代表团。马来亚商务部长也表示，马来亚政府将鼓励扩大对中国贸易的任何努力。新加坡和马来亚的报界和工商业界对两地贸易考察团访问我国，都寄以深切的期望，希望能为发展新加坡、马来亚同中国的贸易关系铺下康庄大道。
    新加坡、马来亚年产橡胶六十多万吨，炼锡六万多吨，几乎全部出口。其他如铁砂、椰干、椰油、菠萝罐头、木材等也大都依靠出口。但，两地粮食不足，必须进口大米，其他如布匹、食品、饮料、轻工业日用品、机器、钢铁、建筑材料等，都需要从外输入。同时，新加坡又是东南亚的一个转口中心，转口贸易越多，经济就越繁荣。因此，对外贸易对新加坡、马来亚的经济生活是有重大影响的问题。
    作为新加坡、马来亚经济主要支柱的天然橡胶产销情况，今年以来以及从今后趋势来看，是不能使人乐观的，橡胶占马来亚农业耕种面积的67％，占出口总值的55％，占用劳动力的30％。橡胶价格的涨跌，不但影响着大大小小的种植者和经营者的利益，影响橡胶工人的生活，而且对马来亚的整个经济繁荣，对新加坡和马来亚联合邦两个政府的财政收入都有着极大的关系。今年一月以来，天然橡胶价格连续下跌，新加坡一号烟胶片每磅价格，一月份是32.47便士，三月份是27.20便士，五月份是23.71便士，6月1日更跌至20.76便士，已经低于1950年6月朝鲜战争开始时22.95便士的水平。这除了因为美国汽车减产等因素，引起资本主义世界橡胶消费量下降以外，另一个主要原因就是美、英等主要橡胶消费国家大量发展人造橡胶生产，给天然橡胶的销路和价格造成了严重的威胁。1955年资本主义世界橡胶消费量是277万吨（其中天然橡胶172万吨），美国就占153万吨（其中天然橡胶六十三万吨）。美国总统艾森豪威尔在国会的报告中说：美国橡胶消费量到1960年将达一百七十万吨，但美国人造橡胶产量1955年底已达125万吨，估计只需到1958年1月人造橡胶产量便可达170万吨，这就是说到1957年夏秋之间，美国就可能无需再从国外购买天然橡胶，而且可能大量输出人造橡胶来与天然橡胶争夺市场。英国最近除向美国购买人造橡胶七万吨外，自己也在发展人造橡胶生产，1958年可以出产五万吨。美英造成的这种情况，不能不使新加坡和马来亚对销售天然橡胶的前途感到严重的关切。不仅这样，在今年6月以前，新加坡和马来亚橡胶却又受到禁运限制而不能对中国出口，失去了中国的市场，瞻望前途，不能不更增加新加坡、马来亚人民和工商界人士的忧虑。因此，今年6月4日，新加坡和马来亚联合邦政府同时采取了解除橡胶“禁运”的措施，立即得到新加坡、马来亚各方面人士的欢迎和拥护，这是完全可以理解的。
    在我国来说，我国政府和人民一向主张在平等互利的基础上，同任何国家发展贸易关系和友谊。随着我国经济建设的发展和人民生活的提高，我国对于橡胶的需要是会不断增长的。我国对于新加坡、马来亚解除橡胶禁运的措施，当然是表示欢迎的。中国根据自己的需要，按公平合理的价格，向其他产胶国家继续购买橡胶外，同样愿意向新加坡、马来亚购买橡胶，以发展中国和新加坡、马来亚的贸易关系。
    我国同新加坡、马来亚之间可以交换的商品是很多的。除橡胶以外，马来亚出产的锡、椰子油、木材等，我国都需要进口。在我国出口方面，不但新加坡、马来亚需要的各种食品、菜蔬、土产、丝绸、茶叶、针棉织品等我国都可以大量供应，而且最近一、两年来，我国各种轻工业产品也已经在新加坡、马来亚市场上建立了良好信誉，因为价格公道、品质优良而受到普遍欢迎。今年7月，我国商品在新加坡和吉隆坡展出，受到参观者的普遍赞美。中国的棉布，被认为“在新加坡、马来亚市场放出异彩，以足够匹头、鲜明色泽、永不退色及价格低廉四大特点，博得一般顾客欢心”。我国工农业产品，如各种建筑材料、纸张、油印机、钢笔、钢琴、缝纫机、自行车、收音机、医药用品、搪瓷、渔网、雨伞、福建漆器、岭南名果、各种名酒、名茶、各种罐头等不下数百余种，都受到新加坡、马来亚居民和工商界人士的欢迎。根据马来亚海关册统计，1955年新加坡、马来亚两地进口的中国商品共值约三千五百万美元。这些商品不但为新加坡、马来亚当地居民所需要和喜爱，而且还给新加坡转口贸易增加了不少收入。显然，在现有基础上继续发展双方的贸易，对于双方都是十分有利的。我们相信，通过这次新加坡、马来亚贸易考察团的访问，双方还一定会发现许多新的可以交换的商品。
    新加坡和马来亚工商界贸易考察团不仅仅是贸易的代表团，同时也是新加坡、马来亚工商界和人民友谊的代表团。我们希望，通过新加坡、马来亚贸易考察团诸位先生的访问，使新加坡、马来亚同我国之间的贸易关系得到进一步的发展，使双方人民之间的友谊更加巩固和增进。（附图片）
