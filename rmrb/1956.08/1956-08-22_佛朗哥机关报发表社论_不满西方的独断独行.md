Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Madrid dispatch: "Arriba," a newspaper, published an editorial on August 19th supporting the compromise solution to the Suez issue proposed by the Spanish delegation at the London conference. It stated that Spain could not "join the 'Western' bloc that Britain and France have recently unilaterally put forward." "Arriba" said, "No one should be surprised that Spain has the freedom to agree with the Soviet Union's realism on certain international issues."

This organ of the Francoist Falange also stated: "Spain cannot agree with what is currently happening in Cyprus, where some people are asking the West to defend British interests... Similarly, Spain does not agree with the actions taken by the French against (Moroccan Sultan) Muhammad V."

"Arriba" simultaneously emphasized that Spain is not a neutralist country. It said that there is a "clear difference" between neutralism and Spain's 100% anti-communist stance.

    佛朗哥机关报发表社论
    不满西方的独断独行
    新华社21日讯　马德里消息：“阿里巴报”八月十九日发表社论，支持西班牙代表团在伦敦会议上所提出的解决苏彝士问题的折衷办法。它说：西班牙不能“同英法两国近来独断地提出来的那种‘西方’集团联合起来”。“阿里巴报”说，“西班牙有在某些国际问题上同意苏联的现实主义的自由，任何人也不应该因此而吃惊。”
    这家佛朗哥长枪党的机关报还说：“西班牙不能同意目前塞浦路斯所发生的事情，在那里，有人要求西方保卫英国的利益……同样，西班牙也不同意法国人对（摩洛哥苏丹）穆罕默德五世所采取的行动。”
    “阿里巴报”同时强调西班牙并不是中立主义者，它说，中立主义同西班牙百分之百的反共立场之间“有着清楚的差别”。
