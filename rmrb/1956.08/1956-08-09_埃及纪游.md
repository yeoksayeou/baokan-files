    (III) A Stroll in Cairo
    Cairo, in Arabic, means "victory." In ancient times, Cairo was merely a small village on the east bank of the Nile. It only began to develop a thousand years ago. Now, Cairo is the largest city in Africa, with a population of over two million.
    Cairo is like a bright pearl tied to the long belt of the Nile. But its history is full of unfortunate experiences. From the sixteenth century onwards, it endured more than three hundred years of Ottoman rule, followed by the occupation of Western colonialists, casting a shadow of shame over Cairo.
    But now, Cairo is a true "city of victory," shining with the light of victory.
    At dawn, the sun climbs up from behind the Mokattam Hills, illuminating the majestic pyramids and the tranquil Nile, and Cairo awakens from its slumber.
    At the foot of the Mokattam Hills stands a magnificent castle—the Saladin Citadel, built in the twelfth century by the Egyptian King Saladin to resist the invasion of the European Crusaders. Having endured wars, one corner of the castle is already dilapidated. This is the highest point in Cairo, and standing on the castle, one can overlook the entire city. According to the Egyptians, in the past, whoever occupied the Saladin Citadel ruled Cairo. The British flag, which once flew over the castle for more than half a century, is now gone. During the Farouk dynasty, this castle was a large prison, but now it has been opened to the public as a place to visit.
    There is a grand mosque on the castle, named Muhammad Ali. At the foot of the castle, there is another large mosque called Sultan Hassan. The mosque covers an area of 10,200 square meters and is about thirty-eight meters high. Here, one can see many masterpieces of Arab art. Throughout Cairo, there are approximately no fewer than four hundred mosques of various sizes, each with one or several domes and several towering minarets, which constitute a distinct feature of the Cairo cityscape.
    Walking along a wide avenue along the Nile is a very interesting experience. The British Embassy building is right next to the avenue. Originally, there was no avenue here. A few years ago, the garden of the British Embassy was close to the Nile, blocking people's way. Anyone who wanted to walk along the river had to stop here and take a large detour. But after the establishment of the Egyptian Republic, the British Embassy site was forced to move backwards, and a wide avenue along the river was built. When our car drove along the avenue, the Egyptian driver mentioned this story of the British giving way more than once, saying: "The British had no choice but to give way."

    埃及纪游

    （三）漫步开罗
    开罗，阿拉伯文的意思是“胜利”。在古代，开罗仅仅是尼罗河东岸的一个小村镇，一千年以前才开始发展起来，到现在开罗已是一个拥有二百多万人口的非洲最大的城市了。
    开罗，像是系在尼罗河长带上的一颗明珠。但是它的身世却充满了不幸的经历。从十六世纪起，它经历了奥斯曼帝国的三百多年统治，随后西方殖民者又来占领了它，给开罗蒙上了耻辱的阴影。
    可是现在，开罗是一座闪耀着胜利的光辉的真正的“胜利的城”。
    黎明，太阳从莫卡丹山岗后面爬上来，照耀着巍峨的金字塔和宁静的尼罗河，开罗从沉睡中醒来了。
    莫卡丹的山脚下有一座雄伟的城堡——沙拉丁城堡，是十二世纪时埃及国王沙拉丁为抵御欧洲十字军的入侵而建立的。由于历经战争，城堡的一角已经颓败。这是开罗的最高处，站在城堡上可以俯览开罗全景。据埃及人说，过去，谁占领了沙拉丁城堡，谁就统治了开罗。曾经在城堡上飘扬了半个世纪以上的英国国旗，现在已经不见了。这个城堡在法鲁克皇朝时代是个大监狱，现在已经开放为人们游览的地方。
    城堡上有一座宏大的清真寺，名叫穆罕默德·阿里。城堡脚下又有一座名叫萨尔丹·赫森的大清真寺。寺的面积达10，200平方公尺，高约三十八公尺。在这里可以看到阿拉伯艺术的许多杰作。整个开罗大约有不下四百个大小清真寺，每个寺都带着一个或几个圆堡及几个高耸的尖标，这就构成了开罗市容的一个鲜明的特征。
    沿着尼罗河在一条宽阔的大道上走，是一件很有意思的事情。英国大使馆的大楼就在大道的旁边。本来，这里并没有大道。几年以前，英国大使馆的庭园紧靠着尼罗河，阻塞着人们的道路。谁要沿河而行，必须到这里止步，绕个大湾子。但是埃及共和国建立后，英国大使馆的馆址被迫向后迁移，于是一条沿河的康庄大道筑成了。当我们的汽车驰过大道时，埃及的司机不止一次向我们提到这件英国人让路的故事说：“英国人不让路不行了。”（上）（附图片）
