    Reactions to Criticism
    Attention Paid to Engineering Quality
    A letter from the Handan Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau states: “The article ‘Natural Phenomenon’ published in the People's Daily on July 24, criticizing the poor quality of the teaching building project undertaken by our bureau for Handan No. 2 Junior Middle School is correct. The occurrence of this engineering accident was due to our neglect of engineering quality and weak technical management. After the accident, we conducted an inspection. We repeatedly educated all employees on the importance of quality first and strengthened the quality inspection organization. Regarding the teaching building project of Handan No. 2 Junior Middle School, we have already requested instructions from higher authorities to reinforce it."
    Guarantee to Overcome Departmentalism
    A letter from the Sixth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry states: "The article 'Why Borrow and Not Return' published in the People's Daily on July 18, criticizing us for not implementing the labor transfer contract, is correct. Due to our insufficient estimation of labor needs in our work, insufficient planning in construction, resulting in occasional idleness and occasional labor shortages. Under these circumstances, instead of actively seeking solutions, we proceeded solely from the interests of our unit, failed to implement the transfer contract, did not return needed workers when due, and dismissed unneeded workers, causing difficulties for the lending unit. Here, we express our apologies to the Third Engineering Division of the Yongdeng Cement Plant and guarantee to overcome departmentalism, strengthen planning, and earnestly implement the transfer contract in the future to prevent similar incidents from happening again."
    Anyang Battery Factory Improves Battery Quality
    A letter from the Local State-Owned Anyang Battery Factory states: “The product quality review column in the People's Daily on July 11, which mentioned that the quality of the 'August 1st' brand batteries produced by our factory was poor, is correct. The 'August 1st' brand batteries did indeed experience deterioration such as rotten zinc cylinders and pulp flushing. After discovering this situation, our factory mobilized technicians and workers to successfully modify and produce 'Zhong' brand and 'Qixing' brand moisture-proof batteries, initially improving product quality. Later, our factory sent people to Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other cities, and visited 23 fraternal factories to learn different formulas and process operating procedures, and produced a special moisture-proof battery, which has already begun production in July. This battery has been improved from 10 hours to 15 hours of discharge; white light time has been improved from 420 minutes to 540 minutes; and storage time has been improved from 6 months to 10 months. As for the 'August 1st' brand batteries, they are products of the past, and there are not many stocks on the market now."

    对批评的反映
    注意了工程质量
    邯郸市建筑工程局来信说：七月二十四日人民日报发表“自然现象”一文，批评我局承建邯郸市第二初级中学教学大楼工程质量低劣是正确的。这个工程事故的发生，是由于我们忽视工程质量，技术管理薄弱，事故发生后，我们已进行了检查。在全体职工中反复进行了质量第一的教育，加强了质量检查机构。关于邯郸市第二初级中学教学大楼工程，我们已经请示上级进行加固。
    保证克服本位主义
    冶金工业部建筑局第六冶金化学建筑总公司来信说：七月十八日人民日报发表“为什么借了不还”一文，批评我们不执行劳动力调借合同，这个批评是正确的。由于我们工作中对劳动力的需用情况估计不足，施工计划性不够，时而窝工，时而又感到劳动力不足。在这种情况下，我们不是积极设法解决，反而单从本单位的利益出发，不执行调借合同，需要的工人到期不还，不需要的工人推出了事，给借出单位工作上带来困难。在这里，我们向永登水泥厂第三工程处表示歉意，并保证今后克服本位主义思想，加强计划性，认真执行调借合同，以防止再发生类似事件。
    安阳电池厂电池质量提高
    地方国营安阳电池厂来信说：七月十一日人民日报产品质量评介栏内，谈到我厂所产“八一”牌电池质量较差，是正确的。“八一”牌电池确实曾一度发生烂锌筒，冲浆等变质情况。我厂发现了这种情况，就发动技术人员和工人改制成功“钟”牌、“旗星”牌防潮电池，初步改进了产品质量。后来，我厂又派人到上海、天津、广州、武汉等市，先后在二十三个兄弟厂参观，学习了不同的配方和工艺操作规程，又制成一种特制防潮电池，已经在七月份开始生产。这种电池，由原来放电十小时提高到十五小时；白光时间由四百二十分钟提高到五百四十分钟；储存时间也由六个月提高到十个月。至于“八一”牌电池，是过去的产品，现在市场上的存货已经不多了。
