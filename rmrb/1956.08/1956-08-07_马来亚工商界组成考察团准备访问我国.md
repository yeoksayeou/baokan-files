Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 6th: A delegation from the Federation of Malaya's business community, scheduled to visit China at the end of August, has been formed. Two groups of delegates – one of seven and one of eight – have already departed for Japan. They left Singapore on August 2nd and 4th respectively, flying via Hong Kong to Japan. More than ten others will depart at the end of the month.

According to Singapore newspapers, the Malayan business community hopes to increase trade between Malaya and China after the lifting of the rubber "embargo."

Singapore newspapers also revealed that a country that has always been at the forefront of opposing China is attempting to buy off business representatives from Kuala Lumpur who are participating in the delegation at a cost of 15,000 to 20,000 Malayan dollars per person, in exchange for publicly announcing their withdrawal from the delegation.

    马来亚工商界组成考察团准备访问我国
    新华社6日讯　新加坡消息：预定在八月底前来中国访问的一个马来亚联合邦工商界考察团已经组成。这个考察团已经有两批团员——一批七人、一批八人——先行出发前往日本访问，他们是先后于八月二日和四日在新加坡乘飞机取道香港前往日本的。还有十多人将于月底启程。
    据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚工商界在橡胶“禁运”取消以后希望增加马来亚和中国之间的贸易。
    新加坡报纸还揭露，一个一向站在反对中国的最前列的国家企图以每人一万五千元到两万元马来亚币的代价来收买吉隆坡方面参加考察团的工商界代表，交换条件是公开宣布退出考察团。
