    Please Improve Product Quality Quickly
    
    Raincoats That Don't Keep Out Rain

    In order to improve attendance rates and ensure the health of workers during rainy-day construction, we specifically purchased 680 raincoats from the Second Wholesale Department of Daily Use Goods at the Xi'an Department Store, at a cost of over 17 yuan each. Who knew that after wearing these raincoats for only a month, they all leaked water, even soaking the clothes worn underneath. The workers said, "Without the raincoat, you're wet; with the raincoat, you're still wet." According to comrades at the Xi'an Department Store, these raincoats are products of the Tianjin Xinsheng Clothing Factory.

    In June of this year, when I was transferred from Changchun, I bought a Hongyu brand single-glue raincoat produced by the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Southeast Raincoat Factory. The first time I wore it, the rain wasn't even heavy, and the raincoat leaked. In the end, I spent 24.4 yuan to buy a leaky coat. (Lu Xiuyu) (Attached picture)

    Good Soap Gone Bad

    I am a salesperson in the soap section of the Tangshan Department Store Building. Recently, many customers have reported that the quality of some soaps has declined. The Luanfeng soap produced by the Tianjin Joint Soap Company used to be of good quality, but now it has deteriorated. It gradually softens when used, the fragrance gradually decreases, and it stings the eyes when washing your face; yet this soap is very expensive, selling for 9 jiao and 3 fen per bar. The Feitian soap produced by the Shenyang Xinsheng Oil Factory quickly became a well-known brand shortly after arriving in Tangshan. The masses reflected that this soap had a lot of foam, was fragrant and hard until the end. However, the quality of this soap has now declined significantly. Consumers are reflecting that it is not as fragrant as before and not as durable. In the past, we used to sell an average of more than 50 bars of Feitian soap every Saturday and Sunday, but now we sell at most about 30 bars.

    I hope these two enterprises will restore the original product quality. (Zhang Shuqin)
    
    Briefs Worn for Only One Day

    On my first trip to Beijing, with excitement, I specially went to Wangfujing Department Store and bought three pairs of bleached striped ribbed elastic men's briefs to bring back as gifts for two friends, and kept one pair for myself. Logically speaking, things bought from the largest department store in the capital, and at a high price (2.2 yuan per pair), should be good! Who knew that after wearing them for only one day, the elastic waistband lost its elasticity. After being washed, it would be impossible to wear them again without alterations at a clothing shop. This product was manufactured by the Cotton Weaving Factory of the Intimate Apparel Joint Operation, supervised by the China Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station. Why are they so irresponsible?

    Noxious Fans
    
    The cooperative in the office building of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sells a kind of rather unsightly black folding fan. I don't know what kind of material is used to coat this fan, but it has a foul odor. It emits an odor even when not in use, and it is even more熏ren when fanning. Taking it to the movies causes the people around to plug their noses, and the person carrying the fan also feels embarrassed. We don't expect every fan to have a fragrant aroma, we just want it to not have the kind of foul odor that makes people nauseous. (Fu Yijie)
    
    "818?" Towel Not Durable

    On June 9th, I bought a "818?" brand striped towel at the Zhonglou Street Department Store in Taiyuan City for 6 jiao and 9 fen. In less than a week, a hole the size of a walnut appeared in the center of the towel. At first, I thought it was accidentally scratched, but after a few more days, even though I was very careful, holes continued to appear one after another. By the end of June, there were a total of six holes. I realized that this was due to the poor quality of the towel. I don't know which factory manufactures this towel (it is not stated on the towel), but I hope this anonymous factory will stop deceiving consumers.

    Towel Shirt Warps

    The storefront of the Tongguan Department Store in Shaanxi displays a kind of Xinghe brand towel undershirt, which looks very beautiful and exquisite. Three young men, including myself, each bought one. It fit perfectly when we first put it on, but who knew it would warp? It lengthened after one wash, and after the second wash, it had already lengthened to below the buttocks. The short sleeves turned into long-sleeved sleeves, and the whole shirt was as loose as gauze. This heartbreaking shirt, which cost more than 4 yuan, was only worn for a little over a week. Why is the quality of such expensive clothes so low! (Hai Tao)
    
    Poisonous Fruit Drink

    In May of this year, the Jilin Food Factory supplied more than 900 dozen fruit drinks to the Dandong Department Store Supply Station of the Chinese People's Volunteers. After inspection by the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry, it was discovered that the wrong ingredients were used. The fruit drink contained too much methanol (toxin). After the matter was discovered, this batch of fruit drinks had already been sold out. I hope the Jilin Food Factory will quickly investigate this matter. (Lu Chao)
    
    Produce Excellent Colored Chalk

    The current colored chalk is really unsatisfactory. It is either so hard that it scratches the blackboard, or so soft that it crumbles with a light pinch. The red color is not bright, the yellow is not beautiful, and the newly created blackboard newspaper looks like it was written two weeks ago; if it is exposed to the sun for a day, it will all turn white the next day. Can the industrial cooperatives that manufacture chalk produce some excellent colored chalk for us propagandists? (Tao Zhicheng)
    
    Spoiled Milk Powder

    In mid-July, I bought a box of Baige brand boxed milk powder produced by Tianjin Longruixing Food Industry Co., Ltd. Who knew that this milk powder had already spoiled? After the child ate it, he started having diarrhea the next day and continued for three or four days. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was indeed caused by eating something that caused indigestion.

    It is said that this batch of milk powder was produced by Longruixing Food Industry Co., Ltd. in 1954. It was later found to be spoiled and was "reprocessed." Now, the facts prove that this batch of reprocessed milk powder still cannot guarantee quality. Selling spoiled milk powder on the market brings great pain to children and mothers. I hope the relevant departments will immediately recall and stop selling this spoiled milk powder. (Zhi Yong)

    请你们赶快改善产品质量
    雨衣不能防雨
    为了提高出勤率，保证雨天施工中工人的身体健康，我们特地在西安百货公司日用百货第二批发部买了六百八十件雨衣，每件十七元多。谁知这批雨衣穿了一个月就全都漏水了，甚至连穿在里面的衣服都湿透了。工人们说：“不穿雨衣身上是湿的，穿上雨衣身上还是湿的。”据西安百货公司的同志说，这批雨衣是天津新生被服厂的产品。
             （胡家庙）
    今年六月，我调离长春的时候，买了一件天津公私合营东南雨衣厂出品的红羽牌单胶雨衣。第一次穿的时候，雨下的并不大，雨衣就漏水了。结果花二十四元四角买来个漏水衣。　（卢秀玉）（附图片）
    雨衣　英鞱
    好香皂变坏了
    我是唐山市百货公司大楼商场部香皂部分的业务员。近来，许多顾客反映有些香皂的质量下降了。公私合营天津造胰公司出品的銮凤香皂，过去质量还不坏，现在变坏了，用起来会逐渐变软，香味逐渐减少，洗脸的时候很辣眼；而这种香皂价钱却很高，每块卖九角三分。沈阳新生油脂工厂出品的飞天香皂，初到唐山不久就成了名牌货，群众反映这种香皂泡沫特别多，用到完还是那么香、那么硬。但是现在这种香皂质量显著下降，消费者纷纷反映不如以前那么香，也不如以前那么耐用了。以前每逢星期六和星期日平均每天都要销售飞天香皂五十多块，现在最多只销售三十块左右。
    希望这两个企业恢复原有的产品质量。　（张树勤）
    就穿了一天的三角裤
    我第一次到北京，怀着兴奋的心情，特地到王府井百货商店买了三条漂白条罗纹弹力男三角裤，带回来作礼物送给了两个朋友，自己还留了一件。照理说，从首都最大的百货商店买回来的东西，又是花了高价买的（每条二元二角），该是好东西吧！那知道穿了一天，松紧带就失去了弹力，下了水以后，不到成衣铺加工，简直就不能再穿。这是中国百货公司上海采购供应站监制，内衣一联营棉织厂制造的产品。为什么他们这样不负责任呢？
             （叶克秋）
    难闻的扇子
    冶金工业部办公楼的合作社里，出卖一种不大体面的黑色折扇。这种扇子不知道涂的什么料，臭味难闻。不扇的时候也会散发臭味，扇起来更加熏人。带它去看电影，惹得周围的人都堵鼻子，带扇子的人也不光彩。我们虽不要求每把扇子都有芬芳的香气，只要没有那种使人呕吐的臭味就行了。　（傅毅杰）
    818?毛巾不耐用
    六月九日，我在太原市钟楼街百货零售店用六角九分钱买了一条“818?”牌彩条毛巾。用不了一个礼拜，毛巾正中就破了一个核桃一般大的洞。开始我还以为是不慎刮破的，但又过了几天，即使我很小心，破洞还是一个接着一个出现，到六月底，共破了六处。我才明白这是毛巾质量太坏的关系。我不知道这种毛巾是哪家工厂制造的（毛巾上没说明），但希望这个隐名的工厂不要再欺骗消费者了。
             （刘彬）
    毛巾衫会变形
    陕西潼关百货公司的门市部，陈列着一种星鹤牌毛巾汗衫，看样子很漂亮，也很精致。我们三个小伙子，每人买了一件。刚穿上正好，那知道它会变形，洗一次长了一段，洗第二次已经长到屁股下边了。短袖变成了大半截袖，满身松得和纱布差不多。花四元多钱买的这件伤心汗衫，只穿了一个多星期。为什么这样贵的衣服，质量这样低呢！　（海涛）
    含毒的果子露
    吉林食品厂今年五月份给中国人民志愿军安东百货供应站加工九百多打果子露。经过吉林省工业厅的检查，发现配错了料。果子露里含甲醇（毒素）太多。事情发觉以后，这批果子露早已卖光。希望吉林食品厂赶快检查这件事。　（鲁超）
    生产优良的彩色粉笔
    现在的彩色粉笔，实在不能令人满意。不是硬得把黑板划出道子；就是松得用手轻轻一涅就碎。颜色红的不鲜，黄的不美，刚出的黑板报，好像两星期以前写的；要是晒一天太阳，第二天就全变白了。制造粉笔的工业社能不能给我们这些宣传工作者生产一些优良的彩色粉笔呢？　（陶志成）
    变质奶粉
    七月中旬，我买了一盒天津隆瑞兴食品工业股份有限公司出品的百鸽牌纸盒奶粉，谁知这种奶粉已经变质，孩子吃了之后，第二天就开始泻肚子，一直泻了三、四天，据医生诊断，确实是由于吃东西引起的消化不良。
    据说这批奶粉是隆瑞兴食品工业股份有限公司1954年出品的，后来发现变质，又“重新加工”的。现在，事实证明，这批经过加工改制的奶粉，还是不能保证质量。把变质了的奶粉在市场上出卖，给孩子和母亲带来很大的痛苦。希望有关部门立即把这些变了质的奶粉收回，停止出售。（志勇）
