Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The leaders of the China Islamic Association held a symposium with the Hong Kong Muslim Delegation this afternoon.

At the meeting, the Hong Kong Muslim Delegation focused on introducing the situation of Muslims in Hong Kong and their feelings during their sightseeing tour. Liu Youxin, the Imam and Director of the Hong Kong Chinese Muslim Philanthropic Association, said that Muslims in Hong Kong are very concerned about the situation of Muslims in the mainland and the construction of New China. During this visit to Beijing, we personally saw the Islamic Theological Seminary, funded by the government, which specifically trains Imams, powerfully demonstrating the freedom of religious belief in New China. I think Muslims in Hong Kong will be very happy to hear about these things. I hope there will be more contact in the future so that we can often learn about the situation in the mainland.

Zhang Yuzhen, Secretary-General of the Islamic Association, Yang Mingyuan, and other members, in their speeches, introduced the work of the Islamic Association and the economic life of Muslims in Beijing before and after liberation. They expressed welcome to more Muslims in Hong Kong to visit in the future.

The Hong Kong Muslim Delegation, including Liu Youxin and three others, arrived in Beijing by train on the afternoon of the 20th at the invitation of the China Islamic Association. They are from the Hong Kong Chinese Muslim Philanthropic Association.

    香港回民观光团称赞祖国宗教信仰自由
    据新华社24日讯　中国伊斯兰教协会的负责人今天下午同香港回民观光团举行了座谈会。
    会上，香港回民观光团着重介绍了香港回民的情况和他们在观光中的感受，香港中华回教博爱社阿訇和理事刘有信说，在香港的穆斯林们都很关心内地穆斯林的情况和新中国的建设。这次在北京我们亲眼见到了政府资助举办的专门培养阿訇的伊斯兰教经学院，有力地说明了新中国宗教信仰的自由。我想，香港的穆斯林们听到这些情况，一定也非常高兴。希望今后有更多的联系，使我们经常这样了解内地的情况。
    伊斯兰教协会秘书长张玉珍、委员杨明远等在发言中，介绍了伊斯兰教协会工作的情况和解放前后北京市回民的经济生活情况。他们表示欢迎今后有更多的在香港的穆斯林来参观、访问。
    香港回民观光团刘有信等一行四人，是应中国伊斯兰教协会的邀请，在20日下午乘火车到达北京的。他们是香港中华回教博爱社的。
