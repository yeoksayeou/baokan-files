Egyptian Labor Unions Reply to Chinese Labor Unions
Thanking the Chinese People for Their Support of the Egyptian People

This newspaper reports that after the Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Company, the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China sent telegrams to the Egyptian Teachers' Union and the Egyptian Textile Union respectively to congratulate them and to express sympathy and support for the just actions of the Egyptian people. The National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China have received replies from the Egyptian labor unions.

Kamel Eddin Hussein, Chairman of the Egyptian Teachers' Union, said in a telegram to the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China on August 19:

“Your eloquent and touching telegram expressing the belief in freedom and human justice has greatly encouraged us, filling us with confidence that our just cause will surely win and that the colonialists who attempt to interfere with our legitimate exercise of sovereignty will surely be defeated.

“Now, Egyptian teachers, holding the belief of defending world justice and freedom, defending the right to autonomy and personal dignity, pledge to carry out collective self-defense at the cost of blood, money, and their own children. Your sincere support for our cause proves that our cause is consistent with the interests of defending world peace and the cause of every oppressed nation striving for freedom and human dignity."

Fahim, representing the Egyptian Textile Union, said in a telegram to the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China on August 19:

“I would like to thank you on behalf of the Egyptian workers for your congratulations to us. I hope that we will all be victorious in the struggle for peace. Thank you."
