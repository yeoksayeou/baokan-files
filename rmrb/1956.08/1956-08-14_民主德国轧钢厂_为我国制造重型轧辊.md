Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th. In the first seven months of this year, the Democratic German steel mills manufactured 117 heavy rolling mill rolls for China. The last batch of rolls manufactured by the Gröditz steel mill were shipped to China a few days ago. Workers participating in the manufacture of the machines wrote words expressing friendship and respect for the Chinese people all over the wooden packing crates. This batch of rolls was forged by Germany's heaviest 6,000-ton hydraulic press. Each roll weighs 16 to 18 tons and has a diameter of 1.1 meters.
