Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 15th – In the mountains and valleys through which the Nei (Jiang) - Kun (Ming) Railway will pass, a water supply surveying team dedicated to finding water sources for the locomotives has completed the water source surveying work for ten water supply stations.

    The water supply surveyors overcame many difficulties on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. For more than thirty days, they have been traversing the deep ravines and mountain cliffs on both sides of the railway lines in Yanjin, Daguan, and Yiliang in Yunnan, and Weining in Guizhou, and Yibin in Sichuan, adopting the method of "following water to its source and visiting the elderly" to find water sources that are pure in quality and economical to obtain for the locomotives.

    After discovering a clear spring in Douyagou, Yanjin County, they visited the elders who had lived there for generations. After tracing and searching, they finally found the "Dragon Cave" where clear water gushes out at the foot of the rocks covered with vegetation. Because this spring water can be used without sedimentation and filtration, and the water source is at a high altitude, eliminating the need for pumping equipment, it can save a lot of money in the future when building water supply stations.

    为火车头找水
    新华社昆明15日电　在内（江）昆（明）铁路将要通过的丛山峡谷里，一支为火车头寻找水源的给水勘测队，已经完成了十个给水站的水源勘测工作。
    给水勘测队员们在云贵高原上，战胜了许多困难。三十多天以来，他们在云南的盐津、大关、彝良，贵州的威宁和四川的宜宾线路两侧，终日跋涉在深沟山崖之间，采用“见水追源，访问老人”的办法，为火车头寻找水质纯净、取用经济的水源。
    他们在盐津县豆芽沟发现一股清泉以后，就访问了世居当地的长者。经过追踪寻找，终于在草木丛生的岩脚下找到了清水喷涌的“龙洞”。由于这股泉水不必沉淀过滤就可以取用，而且水源地势高，不需要抽水设备，因此在将来建设给水站的时候，可以节省许多资金。
