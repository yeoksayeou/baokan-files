    Difficulty Eating for Visitors to Beijing
    For people coming to Beijing from other places, besides the difficulty in finding accommodation, eating is also a problem. Many canteens of government organizations mechanically fix the meal ticket selling time within a certain period. If visitors from other places do not happen to arrive during this time, they have no chance to eat in the government organization.
    Eating in restaurants is also not easy. Many restaurants put up a "Closed" sign after 12 o'clock. Sometimes, even if you arrive before the break, you often cannot buy a meal. As for the crowded conditions in the restaurants, that goes without saying.
    The working hours of us who come to Beijing from other places are difficult to fix precisely within a certain time, like those in government organizations. But I wonder when it will be easy to eat in Beijing!

    北京来客吃饭难
    外地到北京来的人，除了不容易找到住的地方外，吃饭也是困难的。不少机关的食堂，都把售饭票的时间机械地固定在一定时间内，如果外来人没有碰上这一时间，那就无缘在机关吃饭了。
    在饭馆吃饭也不是那么容易的。不少饭馆在十二点以后就挂出了“休息”的牌子；有时在休息前赶到，也常常买不到饭。至于饭馆里的拥挤情况，那就更不用说了。
    我们外地到北京来的人的工作时间，很难像在机关里那样，准确地固定在一定的时间内。但不知道到什么时候，到北京吃饭才不难！
