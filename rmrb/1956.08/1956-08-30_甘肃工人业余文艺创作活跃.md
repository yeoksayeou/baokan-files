Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 28th: The Gansu Province Fourth Workers' Amateur Literary Creation Competition Summary Conference was held on the 26th. A total of 419 works participated in this competition, nearly 100 more than last year, and the artistic level has also greatly improved. Thirty-two works were awarded at this conference.

The short story "Wind and Rain Night," the prose "Night Crossing Wushaoling," and the short poem "Night of Friendship Road," vividly express the working class's attitude as masters of their own destiny and their revolutionary optimism. The one-act plays "The Inglorious Red Flag," "Where is the Glory," and the satirical poem "There is Such a Director," express the working class's firm stance and their sharp struggle against bureaucracy and bourgeois ideology.

This competition also demonstrated the growth and strengthening of the Gansu Province workers' amateur literary team. The coal mine system and commercial system, which had never participated in the competition before, also produced excellent works this year. Li Xiaowu, a lead-type worker at the Lanzhou Bayi Printing Factory, only has a junior high school education. Last year, his work submitted to the competition was used as the worst example for criticism. However, this year, his novel "Encouragement" won first prize because it deeply depicted the ideological qualities of female worker Mei Fanglan helping a proud and complacent worker to make progress together, and embodied the contradictions and struggles in real life.

The award-winning works from this conference will be compiled and published by the Gansu People's Publishing House according to genres such as poetry, novels, plays, and storytelling. Among them, the novels "Wind and Rain Night" and "Night Crossing Wushaoling" have been published in the Gansu Daily.

    甘肃工人业余文艺创作活跃
    新华社兰州28日电　甘肃省第四次工人文艺创作竞赛总结大会在26日举行。参加这次竞赛的作品共有四百一十九件，比去年增加了近百件，艺术水平也有很大提高，在这次大会上受奖作品有三十二篇。
    短篇小说“风雨之夜”、散文“夜过乌鞘岭”、短诗“友谊路之夜”等，都生动地表现了工人阶级主人翁的劳动态度和革命的乐观主义精神。独幕剧“不光荣的红旗”、“光荣在那里”和讽刺诗“有这样一位主任”等，表现了工人阶级坚定的立场，以及同官僚主义、资产阶级思想进行的尖锐斗争。
    这次竞赛也显示了甘肃省工人业余文艺队伍的成长和壮大，过去从未参加过竞赛的煤矿系统和商业系统，今年也都产生了优秀作品。兰州八一印刷厂铅印工人李效武只有高小文化程度，去年参加竞赛的作品曾被当作最差的例子提出评判的，可是今年他写的小说“勉励”，由于较深刻地描写了女工梅芳兰帮助骄傲自满工人共同进步的思想品质，体现了现实生活中的矛盾和斗争，因而获得了一等奖。
    这次大会受奖作品，将由甘肃省人民出版社按诗歌、小说、剧本、说唱等体裁分别汇集出版。其中小说“风雨之夜”和“夜过乌鞘岭”，已先后刊载在甘肃日报。
