Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 18th. The scientific integrated expedition along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway in Fujian Province concluded its work on the 17th.

From July 31st to August 13th, the expedition team conducted a relatively comprehensive understanding of the natural resources along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. They discovered many new clues related to scientific research and production development and proposed suggestions on how to unleash the production potential and develop the mountain economy along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.

Scientific workers in geography, geology, and mineral resources put forward materials on key areas where new mineral deposits might be discovered. Soil, biology, and forestry scientific workers, after further understanding materials related to the distribution of subtropical flora and fauna, suggested that another specialized expedition should be conducted along the railway and in other areas in the future to find reliable bases for distinguishing between the warm temperate and subtropical regions of Fujian Province.

During the expedition, scientific workers also discovered new phenomena such as the interconversion of geology, topography, and soil, and collected some rare animal and plant specimens and new mineral seedlings from Fujian, preparing for future special research.

    鹰厦铁路沿线科学综合考察队
    发现科学研究和发展生产的新线索
    新华社福州18日电　福建省鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路沿线科学综合考察队在十七日结束了考察工作。
    这个考察队从七月三十一日到八月十三日对鹰厦铁路沿线的自然资源等情况作了一次比较全面的了解，他们发现许多有关科学研究和发展生产的新线索，并对如何发挥鹰厦铁路沿线的生产潜力和开发山区经济提出了建议。
    地理、地质和矿藏方面的科学工作者提出了可能发现新矿藏重点地带的材料。土壤、生物和森林方面的科学工作者，在进一步了解到有关亚热带动植物分布的材料后，建议将来在铁路沿线和其他地区再作一次专门性的考察，为区分福建省暖温带和亚热带地区找出可靠的根据。
    在考察过程中，科学工作者还发现了地质、地形和土壤互变等新现象，采集了一部分福建罕见的动植物标本和新的矿苗，准备将来进行专题研究。
