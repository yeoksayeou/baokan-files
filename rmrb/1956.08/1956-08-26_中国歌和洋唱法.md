    Chinese Songs and Western Singing Methods
    Lou Qiangui

    A vocal music worker pays so much attention to the comments of critics and the reactions of the audience! Some time ago, when I went on tour with the Central Experimental Opera House, I was particularly struck when I heard the masses say that our performance "doesn't have a Western flavor, the enunciation is clear, and it feels intimate." I deeply feel that the public's comments and preferences are a reliable basis for distinguishing good from bad; often they are consistent with the requirements of insiders from a technical point of view.

    Speaking of which, it is really pitiful that we, who study Western vocalization methods, have received so little from our predecessors. In the two or three decades before liberation, under the semi-feudal and semi-colonial music education system, we really didn't benefit much and suffered a lot. Leaving aside issues such as vocal techniques, vocal theory, and cultivation, the fact that Chinese people can't sing Chinese songs is the best proof. If you look down on Chinese songs and don't sing Chinese songs, how can you talk about cherishing and studying the mother tongue! This problem has not been completely overcome on today's stage. For example, some choirs have good vocal skills among each member, but when they sing, they are so rigid and the enunciation is not clear; they neither move the audience nor move themselves. Some people want to enunciate clearly, but they chop the words into pieces, making them neither words nor sentences. Some people sing Chinese characters like phonetic alphabets. For example, if it is clearly the word "window" (窗), they have to sing it as "chi wu—ang" or even "chi wu—wang—ang." Some people, in order to maintain the resonance position of the voice, are not singing the lyrics, but opening their mouths wide and singing the five vowel letters of vocal exercises. There is also the worst kind, the so-called "mask" singing method, which is to stuff all the words into the nose, humming, humming, and nothing can be heard clearly. With similar so-called "Western voice" singing methods like these, it is no wonder that the masses have opinions and do not welcome them.

    In fact, people who cannot sing their own national songs well cannot be considered to have mastered Western singing methods. Because the real masters of Western singing methods not only have good vocalization and clear enunciation, but can also fully express emotions.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, vocal music art has had a clear direction of development, and there has been gratifying progress in performance methods and in the pursuit of clear enunciation. Therefore, I hope that those of us who study Western singing methods should strive to overcome these shortcomings that still exist as soon as possible.

    However, I am not saying that there are only these problems in the current vocal music art, nor am I saying that the improvement of skills does not need to be raised. Of course, everyone should make different and focused efforts according to their own situation. But judging from the common shortcomings on the current stage, I think we should first sing the words clearly and express the emotions. In addition, I also hope that music academies will increase language-related courses, and at the same time, in teaching, do not separate the lyrics from technical training.

    To overcome these shortcomings in the singing of our comrades who study Western singing methods, the best way is to learn from national heritage. I heard that in order to train the muscles to be flexible and accurately pronounce various sounds of the lips, teeth, throat, and tongue, our opera actors have a complete set of sound training methods; this set of methods may be more practical and effective for improving our singing than the training methods used by foreign music academies to achieve the same purpose.

    On the day of the national music community's grand meeting, I raise this issue, which is not new but is important, hoping to arouse the attention and discussion of those engaged in vocal music art, so as to improve the level of singing art in our country.

    中国歌和洋唱法
    楼乾贵
    一个声乐工作者是多么注意批评家的评论和听众的反应呵！前些时候，当我随中央实验歌剧院出外巡回演出的时候，听到群众说我们的表演“没有洋味道，吐词清楚，感到亲切”以后，特别引起了我的深思。我深深地感到群众的评论和喜爱，是鉴别好坏的可靠依据；往往是和内行人从技术角度出发的要求一致的。
    说起来，实在可怜，我们这些学西洋发声法的人，从我们的先辈那里接受的东西实在太微薄了。在解放前的二、三十年里，在半封建半殖民地的音乐教育制度下面，我们真是得益不多，受害不浅。先不谈发声技巧、声乐理论、修养等问题，就拿中国人不会唱中国歌这件事来说，就是最好的证明。看不起中国歌，不唱中国歌，又怎么能谈到对祖国语言的珍爱和研究呢！这种毛病在今天的舞台上，也不是完全克服了。例如有些合唱队，每个队员的声乐技巧都还不错，但是唱起歌来却那样死板，吐词也不清楚；既不感动听众，也不感动自己。有些人想把字唱清楚，但又把词咬得七零八碎，成字不成句。有的人把中国字唱得像拚音字母，例如明明是个“窗”字，他非要唱成“吃乌——昂”甚至“吃乌——汪——昂”。有的人为了保持声音的共鸣位置，不是在唱歌词，而是把嘴张得圆圆的，在那里唱着练声的五个母音字母。还有一种最坏的，所谓“面罩”唱法的，就是把所有的字都拥塞在鼻子里，嗡嗡，嗡嗡，什么也听不清楚。类似这样一些所谓“洋嗓子”唱法，就难怪群众有意见，不欢迎了。
    其实唱不好自己国家歌子的人，也不能算是已经掌握了西洋唱法的人。因为真正的西洋唱法的大师们，不但发声好，吐词清楚，也能充分地表达情感。
    解放以来，在党的领导下，声乐艺术有了明确的发展方向，在表现方法上，在追求吐词的清楚上，都有了可喜的进步。因此，我希望我们学习西洋唱法的人，应该在最短时期内努力克服目前还存在的这些缺点。
    但是，我并不是说在目前声乐艺术中只有这些问题，更不是说技巧的提高不需要提出了。当然，每个人更应该按照自己的情况做不同的着重的努力。但从目前舞台上普遍存在的缺点看，我认为应当首先把词唱清楚，把情感表达出来。另外，我也希望音乐学院增加有关语言的课程，同时在教学中不要把歌词这部分从技巧训练中分出来不管。
    要克服我们学习西洋唱法的同志们演唱中的这些缺点，最好的办法，就是向民族遗产学习。我听说，为了训练肌肉，使其灵活，准确地发出唇齿喉舌等各种字音，我们的戏曲演员就有一套完整的练音方法；这一套方法可能比外国音乐学院为了达到同一目的的训练方法，对改进我们的演唱更为切实有效。
    在全国音乐界大会师的日子里，我提出这个不是新鲜、但又是重要的问题来，希望能引起从事声乐艺术工作者的注意和讨论，以便把我国的歌唱艺术水平提高一步。
