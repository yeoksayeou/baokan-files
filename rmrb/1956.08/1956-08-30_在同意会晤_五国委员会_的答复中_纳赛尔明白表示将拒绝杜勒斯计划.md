Xinhua News Agency, August 29th dispatch from Cairo: President Nasser of Egypt has replied to Menzies, chairman of the "Five-Nation Committee," agreeing to the committee's request to meet with him.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Cairo, authoritative sources said on August 28th that President Nasser pointed out in his reply that Dulles' plan for international control of the Suez Canal was fundamentally unacceptable. Nasser made it clear in his reply that he would refuse to negotiate a solution to the Suez Canal dispute on the basis of the Dulles Plan, but he would listen to a full explanation of the plan without it being binding on his actions.

These sources said that Nasser's reply contained a clear condition: that Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, whether based on the principle of ownership or the principle of operation, must not be opposed.

These sources also said that another notable feature of the reply was that the meeting must be held in an atmosphere free of military threats, and that Britain and France should restrain their armed forces from deploying in the Mediterranean.

    在同意会晤“五国委员会”的答复中
    纳赛尔明白表示将拒绝杜勒斯计划
    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔已经答复“五国委员会”主席孟席斯，同意这个委员会请求同他举行的会晤。
    据合众社开罗消息报道，权威人士8月28日说，纳赛尔总统在答复中指出杜勒斯的关于国际管制苏彝士运河的计划是根本不能够接受的。纳赛尔在答复中明白表示，他将拒绝在杜勒斯计划的基础上就解决苏彝士运河争端举行谈判，但是他将在对他的行动并无约束力的情况下听取关于这个计划的充分说明。
    这些人士说，纳赛尔的答复中有一项干脆的条件：埃及对苏彝士运河的主权，不论是根据所有权原则或者是根据经营原则，都不得加以反对。
    这些人士还说，答复的另一个显著特点是：会晤必须在没有军事威胁的气氛中举行，而且英法两国应当约束它们的武装部队在地中海进行部署的活动。
