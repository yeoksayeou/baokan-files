Excessive Material Requisitioning Leads to Disaster

Recently, at the 201 construction site of the Second Construction Team of the Jilin Provincial Construction Company, phenomena such as sand and gravel being mixed together, and cement hardening and deteriorating, have occurred, resulting in wasted materials and the accumulation of a large amount of capital.

The main reason for this waste is that the leaders of the construction site blindly and indiscriminately requisitioned materials. A portion of 6-12 cm gravel needed for this construction site should have been used in late June, but it was brought to the site as early as April and May. The 1.27 million red bricks used for repairing the wall were also brought to the site two months ahead of schedule. According to the plan, river stones should have been brought in late May, but more than 2,000 cubic meters were brought in as early as early April. Zhang Zhenquan, the technical负责人 of the construction site, clearly knew that only 100,000 cement tiles were needed in May, but he repeatedly urged the Second Construction Team's material section, saying: "All 2.53 million tiles must be transported to the site in May, otherwise the construction will be affected, and you will be responsible." As a result, all 2.53 million tiles were transported, but there was no place to store them, so they had to be piled up in large heaps, and then moved in small batches when used.

Due to this blind rush to bring in materials, and the lack of space on site, many materials had to be piled on the railway station platform. Stones of different sizes and specifications were mixed together, and some sand and gravel were piled up together, and white ash was scattered all over the railway platform. The 890 tons of cement that had already been brought in also violated the regulation of seven bags per stack due to the small space, and ten to fourteen bags were stacked together. According to preliminary inspection, some of the cement has already hardened and deteriorated.

This construction site requested an excess of 4,000 scaffolding poles when applying for scaffolding tools. Under the circumstances of a severe shortage of scaffolding tools this year, they should have been returned to the team headquarters. However, they took it upon themselves to use 2,900 scaffolding poles, 1,500 horizontal supports, and 288 planks for temporary construction. These 2,900 good scaffolding poles can no longer be used for engineering (according to regulations, scaffolding poles that have been nailed cannot be used for engineering again, so as to avoid accidents).

Under the circumstances of insufficient supply of building materials this year, this practice is very inappropriate.

    滥要材料成灾
    吉林省建筑公司第二施工队201工地最近发生了砂石掺堆、水泥硬化变质等浪费材料的现象，并且积压了大批资金。
    造成这种浪费的原因，主要是工地的领导人员盲目地乱抓材料。这个工地需用的一部分6—12公分碎石，本来应该在六月下旬使用，却提前在四月份和五月份进场。修围墙用的一百二十七万块红砖，也提前两个月进场。河流石按计划应在五月下旬进场，四月上旬就进场两千多立方公尺。工地技术负责人张振全明明知道五月份只进场十万块水泥瓦就可以了，却向第二施工队材料股再三催要，并且说：“五月份一定要把二百五十三万块瓦全部运到现场，否则影响施工，你们要负责任。”结果二百五十三万块瓦全部运来了，但是无处堆放，只好码起大堆，到使用时再进行小搬运。
    由于这样盲目地抢进材料，现场又放不下，许多材料只好堆在火车站台上。大小规格的石材混在一起，一部分沙子和碎石掺了堆，白灰也撒满了轨道站台。已经进场的八百九十吨水泥，也因为地方过小，竟违反七袋一垛的规定，把十袋到十四袋堆成一垛。据初步检查，已经有一些水泥硬化变质。
    这个工地在申请脚手工具的时候多要了四千根杆子。在今年脚手工具十分缺乏的情形下，本来应该退回队部，可是，他们竟擅自用二千九百根脚手杆子、一千五百根横柱子和二百八十八块跳板作了暂设工程。这二千九百根好好的脚手杆子就再不能用到工程上去了（按照规定，脚手杆钉过钉子就不能再用到工程上去，以免发生事故）。
    在今年建筑材料供应不足的情况下，这种做法是十分不应该的。
