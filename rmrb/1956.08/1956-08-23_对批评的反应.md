    Responses to Criticism
      Excess Personnel Begin to be Transferred
    The Ministry of Railways wrote: After the People's Daily published the article "The Ministry of Railways Construction Engineering Company's tasks are unclear, and the organization is too large" on July 10, 1956, we conducted another inspection. Due to frequent changes in tasks, design failing to keep up with construction, a sharp decline in the number of factory building projects, and the inability to supply materials in a timely manner, we failed to adapt to this situation, adjust tasks in a timely manner, streamline the organization, and transfer excess personnel. As a result, the construction engineering company did indeed have problems such as a large scale, many levels, overstaffing, wasted work, and rush work, which caused considerable losses to the country. These shortcomings were caused by our failure to grasp the situation tightly and address the problems in a timely manner. Now, we have begun to transfer the excess personnel of the construction engineering company and are preparing to thoroughly improve the work of the construction engineering company.
    Not Unwilling, But Actually Unable
    Xin Zhiyue, Deputy Director of the Local State-Owned Jilin Asbestos Factory, wrote that the criticism of me in the People's Daily article "‘Secret Recipe’ Not Passed On" published on July 17 is basically correct. Two comrades from the Beijing Asbestos Factory came to our factory to learn, and due to my bureaucratic approach in my work, I did not provide the necessary assistance, so that they failed to complete their learning plan. I express my deep apologies to them and will definitely improve my work in the future.
    However, it needs to be explained that the construction drawings and certain product formulas that they requested from our factory could not be lent to them for various reasons. My shortcoming in this regard was that I did not explain these circumstances to them clearly.

    对批评的反应
      多余人员开始抽调
    铁道部来信说：1956年7月10日人民日报发表“铁道部建厂工程公司任务不明确，机构太庞大”一文后，我们再次进行了检查。由于任务经常变更，设计赶不上施工，厂房建筑工程数量急剧下降，再加上材料不能及时供应，我们又没有适应这种情况，及时调整任务，紧缩机构，调动多余人员，因而建厂工程公司确实存在着摊子大、层次多、人浮于事、窝工及赶工等现象，给国家造成了不少损失，这些缺点是由于我们抓得不紧，问题处理不及时所造成的。现在，我们已经开始抽调建厂工程公司多余人员，并准备彻底改进建厂工程公司的工作。
    不是不愿，确是不能
    地方国营吉林石棉厂副厂长辛志悦来信说，人民日报七月十七日发表的“‘秘方’不外传”一文对我的批评，基本上是正确的。北京石棉厂的两位同志来我厂学习，由于我工作中的官僚主义，没有给予必要的帮助，以致未能完成学习计划。我对他们深表歉意，今后一定要改进自己的工作。
    但需要说明的是，他们向我厂索取的建厂图纸和某些产品的配方，确实由于种种原因，不能借给他们。我在这方面的缺点是没有把这些情况向他们讲清楚。
