　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd. The Langya Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, has recently taken active measures to help members who were originally estimated not to be able to increase their income to increase their income.

　　The various autumn crops of the Langya Cooperative are growing well this year, and a comprehensive bumper harvest may be obtained. According to the recent estimated yield trial results, 90% of the 1,198 households in the cooperative can increase their income, 75 households can maintain their original income, and 44 households will have lower incomes than before joining the cooperative. For these members who cannot increase their income, after research by the cooperative management committee, it was decided to remedy the situation according to different circumstances. For some members who may have reduced income due to not actively working, the cadres of each team should provide more education and supervision, help them calculate their income accounts, and encourage them to seize the time and actively participate in production. For members who have done less work in the past due to illness or lack of labor, each team will "tailor to the person" and allocate more light or suitable agricultural work to them, while helping them arrange household sideline occupations. Now, each production team is mobilizing members who may have reduced income to work hard in production. The cooperative management committee has allocated some money to lend to these members to buy piglets and ducklings to raise. Cao Dechun, an elderly member of the 20th production team, lacks labor and is not active enough in labor. Last year's income was 44 yuan, and this year he has only worked twelve labor days. Now, after the production team strengthened education, he was assigned to take care of the water for 180 mu of late rice fields and also assigned some light work of cutting potatoes, it is estimated that by the end of September he can get about 70 yuan in remuneration.

　　Due to the above-mentioned measures taken by the cooperative, 52 of the 75 households that maintained their original income will increase their income, and 37 of the 44 households that were originally going to decrease their income will increase their income. In this way, the number of members in the cooperative who increase their income can be increased from 90% to 97.4%.

    安徽省滁县琅琊农业生产合作社
    帮助可能减少收入的社员增加收入
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽省滁县琅琊农业生产合作社最近采取积极措施，帮助原来估计不能增加收入的社员增加收入。
    琅琊社今年各种秋季农作物生长良好，可能获得全面丰收。根据最近估产试算结果，全社一千一百九十八户中有90％的社员可以增加收入，有七十五户保住原来收入，四十四户将比入社前减少收入。对于这些不能增加收入的社员，经社管理委员会研究，决定分别不同情况加以补救。对一些因为不积极劳动而可能减少收入的社员，由各队干部多加教育督促，帮助他们算收入账，启发他们抓紧时间，积极参加生产；对过去因病和缺乏劳力，做工较少的社员，各队“因人制宜”地多分一些轻的或适合于他们特长的农活给他们做，同时帮助他们安排家庭副业。现在，各生产队正在发动可能减少收入的社员努力参加生产。社管理委员会已拨出一部分钱借给这些社员购买小猪小鸭喂养。第二十生产队老年社员曹得春，缺乏劳力，劳动也不够积极，去年收入四十四元，今年只做了十二个劳动日，现在经生产队加强教育后，分了一百八十亩晚稻田的水给他看管，又分些切马铃薯的轻活给他做，估计到九月底合计可得到七十元左右的报酬。
    由于该社采取了上述办法，全社保住原来收入的七十五户社员中有五十二户要增加收入，原来要减少收入的四十四户社员中有三十七户要增加收入。这样，全社增加收入的社员可由90％增加到97.4％。
