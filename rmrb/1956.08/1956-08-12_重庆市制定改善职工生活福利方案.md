Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 9th. The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee passed a plan on the morning of August 8th regarding improving the current living welfare of workers. This plan will focus on addressing new issues related to worker living welfare that have arisen following the rapid development of Chongqing's industrial and mining areas, and the surge in the number of workers in suburban areas.

To improve the supply of goods to workers in suburban areas, the Municipal People's Committee has decided to designate certain areas near industrial and mining zones where factories and mines can directly sign long-term contracts with nearby agricultural production cooperatives for the supply of chickens, ducks, fish, eggs, and vegetables. In residential areas with over 500 households of workers' families, small vegetable markets will be organized to allow them to buy vegetables locally. Additionally, some surplus shops in the urban area will be relocated to industrial and mining zones. Some restaurants, tea houses, laundry services, photography studios, tailoring shops, bathhouses, barber shops, etc., will also be added to the industrial and mining zones. In terms of goods allocation, the Municipal People's Committee stipulates that the needs of industrial and mining zones must be prioritized. Shops in industrial and mining zones can directly purchase goods from specialized companies and wholesale stations in the urban area, and place orders with handicraft departments. For commodities in short supply, they can also purchase them independently from other locations.

Necessary provisions have also been made regarding public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation. For example, the regulations require public transportation to operate extra buses according to the passenger volume on holidays, with the principle of transporting all passengers. Efforts should also be made to promote monthly passes for workers at a 35% to 40% discount compared to ordinary fares to reduce the burden on workers. In addition, the regulations require relevant departments to immediately begin planning price reductions for excessively high rents and electricity prices.

In terms of medical and health services, due to the surge in the number of factory and mine workers, medical personnel are often busy until 12:00 at night, with some unable to rest for two days and two nights, while some patients still cannot get appointments or see a doctor. Some medical personnel in factories and mines also have low technical levels. In response to this situation, in addition to deciding to organize several medical teams to go to factories and mines and recruit traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to work in factories and mines, the Municipal People's Committee has also decided to adopt a method of exchanging doctors, transferring attending physicians from urban hospitals to factories and mines, and then drawing general practitioners from factories and mines to study in urban hospitals, and designating several urban hospitals to establish contact with factory and mine hospitals and provide training for nursing staff. The charging standards for various medical institutions have also been regulated for price reductions. Cultural and recreational venues in industrial and mining areas will also be appropriately improved.

Regarding the most serious and urgent issue of worker housing, the Third Office of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee and the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions have also conducted a comprehensive investigation. The plan proposed by the Municipal People's Committee requires all units to make plans for solving worker housing problems in the next two years. This year, it is planned to strive to complete the construction of 200,000 square meters of residential buildings.

### 重庆市制定改善职工生活福利方案

    重庆市制定改善职工生活福利方案
    新华社重庆9日电　重庆市人民委员会八日上午通过了关于改善目前职工生活福利的方案，将要着重解决重庆市工矿区迅速发展、郊区职工人数激增以后所产生的一些职工生活福利方面的新问题。
    为了改善对郊区职工的物资供应工作，市人民委员会决定，在工矿区附近划出一定的地区，由厂矿直接与附近的农业生产合作社签订供应鸡、鸭、鱼、蛋、蔬菜的长期合同。在五百户以上的职工眷属区里，将组织小型菜市，使他们能就近买到蔬菜。另外，城区过剩的一部分商店也将迁移到工矿区。在工矿区还要增设一些饮食店、茶馆、洗浆房、照像馆、缝纫铺、浴室、理发室等。在货源分配方面，市人民委员会规定必须优先满足工矿区的需要。工矿区商店可以直接向城区专业公司、批发站进货，向手工业部门加工订货；对供应不足的商品，也可向外地自行采购。
    在水、电、交通运输等公用事业方面，也作出了必要规定。例如规定中对公共汽车运输的要求是：应根据例假日客源情况，以加班运完为原则；并且要在职工中大力推销比普通票价低35％到40％的专为职工上下班用的月票，以减轻职工负担。此外，规定中对于偏高的房租和电价，也要求有关部门立即着手规划降价。
    在医疗卫生方面，目前因厂矿职工人数激增，医务人员经常忙到晚十二点，有的二天二夜不得休息，而有些病人还是挂不上号、看不上病；厂矿中有些医务人员技术水平也很低。针对这一情况，市人民委员会除决定组织几个医疗队下厂和吸收中医到厂矿工作以外，还决定采取调换医生的办法，抽调城区医院主治医师到厂矿，再从厂矿抽一般医生到城区医院进修，并指定几个城区医院与厂矿医院建立联系，代理训练护理人员等。关于医疗机构的各项收费标准，也已规定了降低幅度。工矿的文化娱乐场所，也将得到适当的解决。
    关于目前最严重、迫切需要解决的职工住宅问题，重庆市人民委员会第三办公室和重庆市工会联合会也作了全面调查。市人民委员会提出的方案要求各单位做出今、明两年解决职工住宅的规划。今年准备争取完成面积二十万平方公尺的住宅建筑。
