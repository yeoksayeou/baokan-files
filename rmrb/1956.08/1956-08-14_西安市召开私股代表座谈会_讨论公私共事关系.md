Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 12th: Xi'an held its first symposium of private shareholder representatives of industry and commerce from the 4th to the 8th. More than 150 private shareholder representatives from various public-private joint ventures in the city's industry, commerce, catering, and service industries discussed the current partnership between the public and private sides in public-private joint ventures and put forward opinions on improving and strengthening the relationship between the two sides. Heads of the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Local Industry, Bureau of Commerce, Administration for Industry and Commerce, and relevant specialized companies were also invited to attend the symposium to listen to the opinions of the private shareholder representatives.

At the symposium, the private shareholder representatives all agreed that since the implementation of public-private joint ventures in private enterprises throughout the city this year, production and operation have generally developed under the leadership of the public representatives, and the relationship between the public and private sides is generally normal. However, some public representatives have simple, hasty, and impatient work styles and methods and lack trust in private personnel. A private shareholder representative from the public-private joint venture Zhonghua Brick and Tile Factory criticized the public representative of the factory for failing to respect and unite and educate the private personnel well. He said that in July this year, the public representative changed the design of the new brick kiln, which had been approved by the factory's production and construction meeting, without consulting the private representatives, which aroused dissatisfaction among the private personnel. A private shareholder representative from the public-private joint venture Xi'an Chemical Factory pointed out that the public representative did not consider the rationalization proposals of the private personnel, nor did he humbly absorb the management experience of the private personnel. Some private shareholder representatives also pointed out that some public representatives did not care enough about the political studies, social activities, and lives of the private personnel. Private shareholder representatives from public-private joint ventures such as Zhonghua Department Store, Huanghe Cotton Weaving Factory, and Pig Bristle Intestine Casing Processing Factory introduced some of their experiences in improving public-private relations. The representatives also made some suggestions on improving public-private relations and personnel arrangements.

The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce is now sorting out the opinions and suggestions put forward at the symposium and will submit them to the relevant leading departments for reference. The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Commerce has already convened the heads of relevant business departments to conduct a preliminary study of the problems raised by the private representatives and is preparing to formulate some methods for unity and cooperation between the public and private sides, and requires each business department to immediately begin to resolve some of the problems that can be solved at present. The Chinese Communist Party branch of the Zhonghua Brick and Tile Factory is conducting further inspection of the public-private relations of the whole factory, clearly defining the functions and powers of the public and private sides, and at the same time decided to establish some necessary systems in the short term.

    西安市召开私股代表座谈会
    讨论公私共事关系
    新华社西安12日电　西安市在四日到八日召开第一次工商业私股代表座谈会。包括有全市各工业、商业、饮食业、服务业的一百五十多个公私合营企业私股代表，就目前公私合营企业中公私双方共事关系进行了讨论，提出改进和密切公私关系的意见。西安市地方工业局、商业局、工商行政管理局及有关专业公司的负责人也被邀请出席了这次座谈会，听取私股代表们的意见。
    在座谈会上，私股代表们都认为全市私营企业今年实行公私合营以后，在公方代表的领导下，生产经营上普遍有了发展，公私关系一般是正常的。但是，也有些公方代表工作作风和工作方法简单急躁，对私方人员不够信任。公私合营中华砖瓦厂私股代表对这个厂的公股代表不能很好地尊重和团结教育私方人员提出了批评。他说，今年七月公股代表没有征求私方代表的意见，就改变了原来经过全厂生产基建会议通过的新建砖窑的设计，引起私方人员的不满。公私合营西安化工厂私股代表提出公方代表不考虑私方人员的合理化建议，也不虚心吸收私方人员的经营经验。还有些私股代表提出有的公方代表对私方人员的政治学习、社会活动和生活上不够关心。公私合营中华百货售品所、黄河棉织厂、猪鬃肠衣加工厂等厂店的私股代表，介绍了他们搞好公私关系的一些体会和经验。代表们还对改进公私关系、人事安排等提出一些建议。
    西安市工商业联合会现在正在整理这次座谈会提出的意见和建议，将分别提交各有关领导部门参考。西安市商业局已经召集有关业务主管单位的负责人对私方代表所提出的问题作了初步研究，准备制定一些公私之间团结共事的办法，并且要求各业务主管单位对一些目前能够解决的问题立即着手解决。中华砖瓦厂的中共支部正在对全厂公私关系作进一步的检查，明确地划分公私双方的职权，同时决定在短期内建立一些必要的制度。
