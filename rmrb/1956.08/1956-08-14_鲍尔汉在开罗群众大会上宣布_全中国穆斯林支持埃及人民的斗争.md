Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 13th: The Chinese Islamic Hajj Delegation, visiting Egypt after performing the Hajj in Mecca, participated in a mass rally in Cairo on the evening of August 10th, convened by the "Organization for the Liberation of Muslim Peoples," in support of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

    Burhan, head of the Hajj delegation, addressed the rally, stating, "On behalf of ten million Chinese Muslims and all the people of China, I declare that Chinese Muslims and all the people of China firmly support Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company." He said, "This measure by the Egyptian government is legitimate and just. It is a measure within the scope of Egypt's own sovereignty. This measure is in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Charter of the United Nations." He said, "The proposal to implement international control over the Suez Canal is an act of infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty."

    Burhan said that the Egyptian people, who have the experience and glorious tradition of a long-term struggle against imperialism, will not be intimidated by the military threats of the imperialists. On the contrary, the imperialists will encounter strong opposition from the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world.

    Burhan's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause, cheers, and shouts of "Long Live People's China!"

    Representatives from more than twenty countries, including Indonesia, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Morocco, and Greece, participated in the conference.

    On August 12th, the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation visited Al-Azhar University in Egypt. The president of the university, Abdul Rahman Taj, had a cordial conversation with Burhan. Taj said, "Al-Azhar University welcomes Islamic youth from any country to come here to study, especially Chinese youth, because everyone knows that there is a particularly friendly relationship between Egypt and People's China."

    Burhan welcomed Taj to visit China. Taj said, "I would be very happy if I could visit great China." He also asked Burhan to convey his greetings to the Muslims of China, the Chinese people, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Mao Zedong. The Hajj delegation visited the university's library, which houses 120,000 books, and part of the campus. Gifts were exchanged between the hosts and guests.

    鲍尔汉在开罗群众大会上宣布
    全中国穆斯林支持埃及人民的斗争
    新华社开罗13日电　从麦加朝觐后到埃及访问的中国伊斯兰教朝觐团八月十日晚间在开罗参加了由
  “争取穆斯林人民解放组织”召集的支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的群众大会。
    朝觐团团长鲍尔汉向大会致词说，我代表一千万中国穆斯林和全中国的人民宣布中国的穆斯林和全中国人民坚决支持埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有。他说：埃及政府的这个措施是合法而正当的。这是一种在埃及本身的主权范围以内的措施。这个措施是符合万隆会议的精神和联合国宪章的。他说：对苏彝士运河实行国际管制的建议是一种侵犯埃及主权的行为。
    鲍尔汉说，具有同帝国主义者进行长期斗争的经验和光荣传统的埃及人民是不会被帝国主义者的军事威胁吓倒的。相反，帝国主义者将遭到亚洲、非洲和全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈反对。
    鲍尔汉的讲话一再为掌声、欢呼声和高呼人民中国万岁的口号声所打断。
    参加这次大会的有来自印度尼西亚、叙利亚、伊拉克、苏丹、摩洛哥和希腊等二十多个国家的代表。
    八月十二日，中国伊斯兰教朝觐团参观了埃及爱资哈尔大学。这个大学的校长阿卜杜勒·腊赫曼·塔季同鲍尔汉进行了亲切的谈话。塔季说：“爱资哈尔大学欢迎任何国家的伊斯兰青年到这里来学习，特别是欢迎中国青年，因为大家知道，在埃及和人民中国之间有着特别友好的关系。”
    鲍尔汉表示欢迎塔季到中国访问。塔季说：“如果我能够访问伟大的中国，我很高兴。”他还请鲍尔汉代他向中国的穆斯林、中国人民、周恩来总理和毛泽东主席致意。朝觐团参观了这个大学藏书十二万册的图书馆和一部分校园。宾主之间互相赠送了礼物。
