Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 17th: Coal field prospectors working in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces have discovered a batch of coal suitable for industrial and transportation use.

    In the Tongchuan, Baishui, and Pucheng mining areas of the Weibei Coal Field in Shaanxi, the Northwest Coal Field Geological Bureau and the Northwest Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology have successively submitted geological data for fifteen mining areas. Three new pairs of modern mines are under construction in this region. In the Shandan Coal Field, located in the central part of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, at the northeastern foot of the Qilian Mountains, geological data suitable for designing new mines were also submitted for four sites before the end of July. Among them, three pairs of mines are under construction. Intensive exploration is currently underway in the Yaojie Coal Field in Yongdeng, Gansu. The coal seams here are very thick and have a layer of oil shale on top that can be used to refine petroleum. They are relatively shallow, making them suitable for open-pit mining. The open-pit geological report can be submitted to the state in September. In the Datong mining area, more than 40 kilometers northwest of Xining, Qinghai, there is already a pair of local state-owned mines. Preliminary investigations have revealed more coal deposits around the mining area. This year, a general survey team has been dispatched to work in this area, and a drilling team is preparing to transport drilling rigs for exploration.

    The aforementioned mining areas have convenient transportation. A railway branch line connecting the newly built Tongchuan mines is under construction, and the coal produced in the future can be transferred to the Shaanxi industrial zone along the Longhai Railway via the Xianyang-Tongchuan Railway. The Shandan Coal Field is strategically located, with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway passing by it, which can solve the coal needs of the emerging industries in the Lanzhou area. Locomotives running on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can also obtain fuel from here. The Yaojie Coal Field in Yongdeng will also have a dedicated railway line connecting to the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, which is only more than ten kilometers away from the railway line that will be built. In the future, it can not only supply coal for locomotives on this railway but also support the industrial coal needs of Qinghai Province. The Datong mining area, which already has a highway to Xining, will also have a railway branch line built in the future, so that the coal deposits here can be used to solve the industrial and civilian fuel needs of Xining City as soon as possible.

    In order to prepare for the future needs of new coal resources in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, the Northwest Coal Field Geological Exploration Bureau is not only further expanding the general survey work in Baishui and Chunhua in the Weibei Coal Field in Shaanxi, but also conducting large-scale general surveys and exploration in the Shizuishan area at the eastern foot of the Helan Mountains, 100 kilometers northeast of Yinchuan in Gansu, in order to solve the coal needs of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. Geological personnel have also been dispatched to conduct coal field general surveys in Yongchang and Gulang in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu. In order to meet the needs of the new industrial coal needs in Qinghai Province, a general survey team has also been dispatched this year to conduct reconnaissance work near Wenquan in Qinghai.

    This year, a total of eighteen general survey, measurement, and drilling teams are distributed in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces. The area covered by general surveys and measurements is over 3,700 square kilometers, and the drilling footage has doubled compared to last year.

    煤田勘探人员足迹遍及西北的三千七百多平方公里
    在陕西甘肃青海找到一批工业交通用煤资源
    新华社西安17日电　分布在陕西、甘肃、青海三省煤田的勘探人员已经找到一批工业和交通用煤。
    在陕西渭北煤田的铜川、白水、蒲城矿区，西北煤田地质局和地质部西北地质局现在已经先后交出十五个井田的地质资料。在这个地区新建的三对现代化的矿井正在施工。在甘肃河西走廊中部、祁连山东北麓的山丹煤田，今年七月底以前也交出了四个可供设计新矿井的地质资料，其中三对矿井正在建设。甘肃永登的窑街煤田，现在正在进行精查勘探。这里的煤层很厚，上面又有一层可炼石油的油母页岩，它们离地面较浅，适宜露天开采。今年九月便可以把露天地质报告交给国家。青海西宁西北四十多公里的大通矿区，原来已经有一对地方国营矿井。经初步调查在矿区周围还有煤藏，今年已经派出一个普查队在这个地区进行工作，一个钻探队正准备启运钻机，进行勘探。
    上述这些矿区交通方便。贯通铜川新建矿井的铁路支线正在施工，将来生产的煤可以通过咸（阳）铜（川）铁路转到陇海铁路沿线的陕西工业区。山丹煤田地位适中，兰新铁路在它的旁边通过，可以解决兰州地区新兴工业部分用煤；行驶在兰新铁路线上的机车也可以从这里取得燃料。永登窑街煤田将来也有铁路专线接通兰青铁路，它距将修筑成的兰青铁路只有十多公里。将来不但可以供这条铁路机车用煤，还可支援青海省的工业用煤，现在已经有公路通往西宁的大通矿区，将来还要修筑铁路支线，这里的煤藏可以早日解决西宁市的工业和民用燃料。
    西北煤田地质勘探局为要准备陕西、甘肃、青海三省日后需要的新的煤炭资源，除在陕西渭北煤田的白水、淳化进一步扩大普查工作以外，在甘肃银川东北一百公里的贺兰山东麓石咀山正进行大面积的普查勘探，以便解决包兰铁路用煤。在甘肃河西走廊的永昌、古浪也派了地质人员进行煤田普查。为了适应青海省新建工业用煤需要，今年也派出一个普查队在青海亹源附近做踏勘工作。
    在陕西、甘肃、青海三省今年共分布十八个普查、测量和钻探队，普查和测量的面积达三千七百多平方公里，钻探进尺比去年增加了一倍。
