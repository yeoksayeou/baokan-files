Parboiled rice is a type of rice made by first steaming paddy rice, drying it, and then processing it into white rice.

Before liberation, in rural areas such as Changxing County, Zhejiang, many farmers had their own earth-stove steaming equipment. When the new grain came in, they steamed it as they harvested it. This batch of parboiled rice was then transported by grain merchants to large cities such as Huzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai for sale. After liberation, the state purchased more paddy rice and less brown rice; after agricultural collectivization, labor changed from surplus to shortage. Therefore, farmers no longer produced parboiled rice for sale, except for their own consumption. Residents of Wuxing, Huzhou, Anji and other places in Zhejiang have a habit of eating parboiled rice. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, the masses requested the state to continue to supply it. It was also more cost-effective for the state to manage parboiled rice than unsteamed rice. Therefore, the state grain departments in that area still produce a small amount of parboiled rice for sale, but it is still insufficient to meet the needs of the masses. At present, the grain department is working to restore the folk parboiling equipment in Zhejiang and is preparing to trial-produce mechanized parboiled rice in cities such as Shanghai.

The consumption of parboiled rice is also extremely common among residents of countries such as India and Ceylon; the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, and other countries have also set up mechanized parboiled rice factories. The broad masses of people love to eat parboiled rice, and the state grain department also attaches great importance to it. There are many reasons for this.

First of all, compared with making ordinary rice, making parboiled rice can save a lot of grain. Generally, for the same grain variety, producing the same standard product, one hundred catties of paddy rice can produce two to three catties more parboiled rice. If parboiled rice is promoted nationwide, it can save billions of catties of grain.

Secondly, parboiled rice has high nutritional value and is easy to digest. Shen Qizhen, Dean of the Central Institute of Hygiene, said: The parboiled processing method used in China for thousands of years is very scientific. Rice grains made with this method can not only be stored for a long time, but also, because the nutrients in the bran penetrate into the endosperm during the steaming process, the loss of vitamins can be avoided during the debranning and milling process. Furthermore, nutritionist Wang Facheng said: Parboiled brown rice, after one grinding, can still retain 94% of vitamin B1, 72% of vitamin B2, and 81% of nicotinic acid; after three grindings, the rice still retains 88% of vitamin B1, 60% of vitamin B2, and 73% of nicotinic acid. The rice cooked from parboiled rice is soft, palatable, and easy to digest. At the same time, cooking rice expands more, which also saves grain consumption. The No. 1 Middle School of Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, uses parboiled rice to cook, and the rice yield per catty is 21.5% higher than ordinary white rice.

Thirdly, parboiled rice can also be stored for a relatively long time and is a good way to deal with moldy grain. In 1953, the Shanghai Grain Company stored a batch of parboiled rice from January to September. After the plum rain season and the hot summer, it did not develop insects or deteriorate due to heat; Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, has stored a batch of parboiled rice from the fourth quarter of 1955 to the present, and it has not developed insects or deteriorated. If paddy rice is severely infested with insects or is difficult to handle after being flooded, it can be easily stored after steaming. For example, in May 1954, a flood broke out in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, and more than 500,000 catties of paddy rice were eroded by water. It was urgently transported to Huzhou City by car that night to be converted into parboiled rice, and the grain quality did not deteriorate due to the water.

Despite the many advantages of parboiled rice, its production has not been promoted. This is because many people believe that parboiled rice is not suitable for people's eating habits; that making parboiled rice will reduce pig feed; and that making parboiled rice requires mechanization, etc. In fact, these views are problematic. As far as people's appetite and habits are concerned, after liberation, many cadres from other places came to western Zhejiang. They had never eaten parboiled rice before, but now they have become fond of it. Furthermore, the promotion of parboiled rice is also being carried out gradually. At the same time as promoting parboiled rice, it is also necessary to supply ordinary rice. After the promotion of parboiled rice, because broken rice is reduced, the corresponding by-products are reduced, which directly reduces the feed eaten by pigs. This is indeed the case. However, converting to parboiled rice increases the amount of nutritious rice, while reducing the amount of by-products. The increase is for people to eat, and the decrease is for pigs to eat. Why can't people eat more rice and exchange miscellaneous grains for pigs to eat?

The production of parboiled rice does not necessarily require mechanization. At present, the traditional method of steaming rice is simple and requires little investment. As long as there are two rooms and 500 yuan in funds, a parboiled rice factory with a daily output of about 15,000 catties can be built. According to Zhejiang's experience, this small-scale traditional parboiling method can be built near grain depots and rice mills. Purchase and steam as you harvest during the grain harvesting season, or steam first and then dry once when drying the grain, which can save a lot of grain drying costs. There is no profound technology involved in the traditional method of steaming rice. Before the trial production of parboiled rice in Jinhua, Lanxi, Zhuji and other places in Zhejiang last year, only a few workers were sent to study for a week before they learned the production method. Therefore, I believe that the grain department should make a promotion plan to gradually promote parboiled rice on the basis of fully utilizing and improving the traditional method of steaming rice. This is of practical significance.

Making parboiled rice is an excellent experience of the working people of our country, and we should learn from these experiences to increase more grain for the country.

    营养丰富便于保管的蒸谷米
    柳德元
    蒸谷米是把稻谷先经过蒸制，晒干后再制成白米的一种大米。
    解放前，浙江长兴县等地一带的农村里，很多农户自己备有土灶的蒸谷设备，当新谷登场后，随收随蒸，这批蒸谷米由粮商贩运到湖州、杭州、上海等大城市投售。解放后，国家购粮多收稻谷，少收糙米；农业合作化以后，劳动力由多余变为不足，所以农民除自食粮外，已不再制作蒸谷米出售了。浙江吴兴、湖州、安吉等地的居民，素有食用蒸谷米的习惯，粮食统购统销后，群众纷纷要求国家继续供应，而国家经营蒸谷米亦较未蒸者合算，所以那一带的国家粮食部门，仍然制作少量蒸谷米出售，但总不敷群众需要。目前粮食部门正在着手恢复浙江一带民间的蒸谷设备，并准备在上海等城市试制机制蒸谷米。
    蒸谷米在印度、锡兰等国的居民中，食用也极为普遍；苏联、美国、日本等国，也都设有机械化制作蒸谷米的工厂。广大人民喜爱食用蒸谷米，国家粮食部门也很重视，这是有许多原因的。
    首先，制作蒸谷米和制作普通米比较，可节约很多粮食。一般是同一粮种，制作同一标准的产品，一百斤稻谷，可多产二至三斤蒸谷米。如果全国推广蒸谷米，就可节约数十亿斤粮食。
    其次，蒸谷米的营养价值高，而且容易消化。中央卫生研究院院长沈其震说：我国数千年来沿用的蒸谷加工制米方法，是非常合乎科学的。用这种方法制成的米粒，不仅可以经久储藏，而且由于在蒸谷过程中，糠皮的营养素浸入胚乳，因而在去糠和碾磨的过程中，可以避免维生素的损失。又如，营养学家王发成说：蒸谷糙米，经过一道碾磨，它还能保存维他命B194％，维他命B272％，尼可酸81％；经过三次碾磨，米中还保存维他命B188％，维他命B260％，尼可酸73％。蒸谷米煮成的饭松软可口，易于消化，同时做饭涨性大，也就节约了粮食的消费。浙江金华市第一中学用蒸谷米煮饭，每斤比普通白米出饭率要增加21.5％。　第三，蒸谷米还能比较长时期保管，是处理霉害粮食的好办法。1953年上海市粮食公司，把一批蒸谷米从一月份开始储存到九月份，经过霉雨季节和炎热的夏天，没有生虫和发热变质；浙江兰溪县从1955年第四季度储存一批蒸谷到现在，也未生虫变质。假如稻谷虫害严重或遭水侵而处理困难时，只要经过蒸制，就能利于保管。例如1954年5月，浙江富阳县洪水暴发，有五十多万斤稻谷被水侵蚀，就在当天晚上用汽车急运湖州市改制蒸谷，而粮质并不因受水变坏。
    尽管蒸谷米有这许多优点，可是制作蒸谷米却没有得到推广。这是由于有不少人认为，蒸谷米不适合人们的食用习惯；制作蒸谷米要减少猪的饲料；制作蒸谷米需要机械化等等。其实，这些看法是有问题的。就以人们的胃口、习惯来说吧，解放后，浙西一带来了很多外地干部，他们过去没有吃过蒸谷米，现在变得爱吃蒸谷米了。再说，推行蒸谷米也是逐步进行的，在推行蒸谷米的同时，还必需有普通大米供应。推广蒸谷米后，由于碎米减少，而相应减少些副产品，直接减少猪吃的饲料，这倒是事实。但是改制蒸谷米增多了富有营养的大米，少了的是副产品。增加的是人吃的，减少的是猪吃的，为什么不可以叫人多吃些大米，而调换杂粮给猪吃呢？
    蒸谷米制作并不一定非要机械化才成。目前土法蒸谷，办法简单而且投资很小，只要有两间房屋和五百元的资金，就可建日产一万五千斤左右的蒸谷厂。根据浙江的经验，这种小型的土法蒸谷，粮仓、碾米厂附近均可自行筹建。收粮季节随购随蒸，或者晒粮时，先蒸后晒一次而成，可节约很大一笔粮食翻晒费用。土法蒸谷也没深奥的技术，浙江的金华、兰溪、诸暨等地，去年试制蒸谷米前，只派个别工人学习一个星期，就学会了制作方法。因此，我认为，粮食部门应该作出推广规划，在充分利用与改进土法蒸谷的基础上，来逐步推行蒸谷米，这是有现实意义的。
    制蒸谷米是我国劳动人民的优秀经验，我们应该很好地吸取这些经验，为国家增加更多的粮食。
