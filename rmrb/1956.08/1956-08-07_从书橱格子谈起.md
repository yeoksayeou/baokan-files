    Starting from Bookshelf Grids
    Jiang Weipu
    Recently, some bookstores have made the following suggestions to the comic book publishing departments: “The size of comic books should preferably uniformly use the original 60mo format. The newly published 40mo and 48mo formats are not suitable for the grids of our bookstore bookshelves, making management and display extremely inconvenient. Therefore, it is inconvenient to order. . . ”
    It turns out that bookstores are basing their ordering standards on the size of their fixed bookshelf grids. This is truly an unprecedented absurdity!
    In fact, not only is the format of comic books based on "grids," but the content and presentation methods of current comic books also have fixed "grids." Although the book titles may seem different, readers often get stories of similar size and uniform specifications from the books. For example, "folk tales" are often: two brothers, one lazy and the other diligent, the older brother bullies the younger brother, and as a result, the older brother suffers, and the younger brother gets good fortune. Or: a young couple falls in love, the male protagonist is brave and strong, and the female protagonist is affectionate and kind. Unfortunately, they encounter a landlord bully or a demon who sabotages them, abducts the female protagonist, so the male protagonist bravely rescues her, slays the demon and eliminates the evil, and they are reunited; or they suffer misfortune and sacrifice themselves, turning into exotic flowers and birds, passed down to future generations.
    If it reflects advanced production and inventions in industry, then it is this "grid": a certain worker studies and creates, encountering obstacles from bureaucrats and ridicule from backward individuals, so his confidence fluctuates. Later, he is encouraged and inspired by the Party Secretary, re-energized, and finally succeeds, and educates the bureaucrats and backward individuals. If it is about agricultural cooperation, it is still using the old "withdrawal from the cooperative, individual farming, difficulties, transformation" grid. In expressing the lively and colorful life of children, they are also often embedded in rigid "grids": those little protagonists carrying individualism, making mistakes again and again, leading to lagging behind in their studies, or getting sick or injured. Then, excellent classmates help and educate them, moving them, plus a sermon from the teacher and counselor, and they finally repent. . .
    These "grids" are no longer secrets. Readers can guess the entire content just by looking at the first few pages of these books. However, writers are still reluctant to break these "grids," thinking that doing things according to established specifications is simpler and easier than independent thinking, and that having "grids" as a basis for their works seems stable and reliable, so they will not be criticized for distorting policies, nor will there be errors that violate reality. Therefore, even if it is not a secret, they still think it is a "trick."
    Of course, this is not just a problem with comic books. Most of the current comic books are adapted from literary works. Therefore, breaking the "grids" is not just the matter of comic book writers.

    从书橱格子谈起
    姜维朴
    近来有些书店向连环画的出版部门提出了这样的意见：“连环画的开本大小最好一律用原来的六十开，新出的四十开和四十八开本，不适合我店书橱的格子，管理和陈列极不方便，因此不便订货。……”
    原来书店订货的标准是按照他们固定的书橱格子的大小为依据的，这真是千古奇闻！
    其实，不但连环画的开本形式有“格子”为准，目前连环画的内容和表现方法也有着固定的“格子”。尽管书名似乎不大一样，但是读者从书里得到的却往往是尺码相似、规格一律的故事。例如“民间故事”，往往是：兄弟两个，大的懒，小的勤，大的欺侮小的，结果大的倒了霉，小的得了好。或者：一对青年男女相爱，男主角勇敢而强悍，女主角多情而善良，不幸遇到地主恶霸或者妖魔从中破坏，劫走了女主角，于是男主角奋勇相救，斩妖除奸，重获团圆；或遭到不幸而牺牲，变成奇花异鸟，流传后世。
    如果是反映工业上的先进生产、创造发明，那么是这样的“格子”：某工人钻研创造，遇到官僚主义者的阻碍和落后者的讽刺打击，于是信心波动，后来受到党委书记的鼓励和启发，重新鼓舞起来，终于成功，并教育了官僚主义者和落后者。如果是表现农业合作化，那么至今也还是用的“退社单干、困难转变”的老格子。在表现活泼多采的儿童生活时，也多被嵌进了死板的“格子”：那些背着个人主义的小主人公，一错再错，以致功课落后，或生了病、受了伤，于是优秀的同学相机帮助教育，使之感动，加上老师和辅导员的一番训诲，而终于幡然悔改。……
    这些“格子”本来早已不是什么秘诀了。读者们只要一看这些书的开头几页，就可以猜到全部的内容。但是作家们却还舍不得打破这些“格子”，以为按照固有的规格办事，较之独立思考，总要简便容易得多，而且作品有“格子”为凭，似乎稳当可靠，既不至于被批评为歪曲政策，也不会出现违犯现实的差错。因此即使不是什么秘诀，总还以为不失为一个“窍门”。
    当然，这不仅是连环画的问题，目前的连环画多数是根据文学作品改编的。所以，打破“格子”，也就不光是连环画作家的事了。
