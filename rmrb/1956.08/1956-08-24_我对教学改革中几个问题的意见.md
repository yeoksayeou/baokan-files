My Opinions on Several Issues in Teaching Reform
Chen Daxie, Academic Dean of Jiaotong University

Since the restructuring of departments and teaching reforms in 1952, Jiaotong University has transformed from an old-style institution that cultivated generalists into a school that cultivates well-rounded specialists. Over the past four years of teaching reform, with the efforts of all faculty and students, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, Jiaotong University has achieved great success in cultivating talent, but there are also many shortcomings, which should be considered shortcomings of development.

Among the achievements of teaching reform at Jiaotong University, I will only mention one point. At the national examination meeting for the Power Machinery Manufacturing major recently held at Jiaotong University, the chief engineer of a certain enterprise, who presided over the meeting, affirmed that the level of graduation design has been improving year by year. The level this year is equivalent to that of the chief designer of the enterprise, which is equivalent to the level of previous graduates after three years of work. The students who graduated from Jiaotong University this year still follow a four-year system, and the level of students graduating from the five-year system in the future will certainly be even higher. However, this chief engineer also pointed out some shortcomings of Jiaotong University graduates, namely that the process and economic aspects of graduation design are not sufficiently mastered. This is exactly where Jiaotong University needs to work hard to improve. The situation in other majors is roughly similar.

Here I want to mention a related issue, which is the proportion of basic courses to specialized courses. Some comrades believe that in engineering colleges, the proportion of specialized courses (referring to major specialized courses) can be greatly reduced, while the proportion of basic courses can be increased. I do not agree with this view. Excessively reducing specialized courses is more or less moving towards restoring the cultivation of generalists, forcing graduates to continue learning in factories for a period of time before they can take on responsible work, which is incompatible with the situation of China's large-scale industrial construction and the urgent need for responsible technical cadres. However, in order to better advance towards science and resolve the contradiction between number and quantity, I believe that it is certainly possible to cultivate deeper basic scientific knowledge for some students through division of labor between schools or through elective courses within the same school. This kind of division of labor does not mean a change in the direction of specialist training, but rather a more specific embodiment of specialist training.

Here, I also want to mention several issues regarding professional teaching.

First and foremost is the issue of student workload. In the past year at Jiaotong University, the school has used 57 hours per week of student study time as a warning line. Whenever the study time of middle-level students in a class exceeds 57 hours, the relevant department and the Academic Affairs Office must study the workload of this class and try to reduce it. Individual classes that reached 60 hours were subject to emergency adjustments. In the past year, except for the final stage of graduation design for graduating classes, only a very few classes reached 60 hours, and only for a very short period of time. A very small number of classes exceeded the 57-hour warning line. The vast majority of classes spent the vast majority of their time studying for around 54 hours per week. Based on the above figures, it can be said that the problem of excessive student workload does not exist or is not serious at Jiaotong University. But has the problem of excessive student workload been solved? Absolutely not. From the perspective of Jiaotong University, the main reasons for excessive student workload are three: namely, too much time is spent on exercises and homework, too much time is spent on experiments and reports, and the teaching efficiency of some lecturers is not high enough. The last factor has the most serious impact. At Jiaotong University, there are still a little less than 5% of lecturers whose teaching efficiency is relatively poor, which has a great impact on student workload. The method we have adopted is to ensure that no class has more than one course taught by a teacher with relatively poor efficiency. However, even with only one teacher with relatively poor teaching efficiency, students unnecessarily increase their study time by several hours each week, sometimes even more than ten hours. Regarding the two factors of exercises and homework, and experiments and reports, these are the two main aspects of our current stage of controlling student workload. If the workload of a certain class exceeds the warning line, then the exercises and homework of the course that generates the heavier workload are reduced, and the experiments and reports are simplified. We have also proposed that reducing exercises and homework must be accompanied by a reduction in lecture content, but the instructors generally rarely do this, and most simply reduce the amount of exercises. What is the result of doing this? Due to the reduction in the amount of exercises, what students learn is not sufficiently consolidated, which also hinders the cultivation of further independent thinking ability. Due to the simplification of experimental methods and reports, some experiments become filling in numbers and filling out forms, the content is boring, and students benefit very little. In courses without course design, in addition to the systematicness and heuristic nature of the lectures, exercises and experiments are two major avenues for cultivating students' independent work. Now that both avenues cannot proceed smoothly, the cultivation of independent work ability will of course be greatly reduced. So it can be said that the workload is not heavy, but the price paid is huge, that is, the weakening of the cultivation of students' independent work ability.

At the beginning of last semester, such a serious shortcoming was discovered at Jiaotong University, but we have not yet found a suitable solution in the mutual contradiction of study time, lecturing quantity, assignments, and experimental quantity. Individual teaching and research groups, such as the mechanics teaching and research group, have conducted more in-depth research on the issue of the amount of exercises. Their conclusion is that what affects students' ability to work independently is not only the amount of exercises, but also the nature of the content of the exercises. How to progress from the shallow to the deep, how to closely cooperate with the lectures, are all extremely important. In other words, how to make appropriate arrangements and arrangements for the content of the exercises so that students can receive the most effective training in a relatively economical time is also an unadulterated teaching method issue. The improvement of teaching methods and the appropriate enrichment of quantity are the improvement methods that should be adopted. This is the case in experimental classes and in course design classes.

I say on the one hand that the quality of professional work has greatly improved after the teaching reform, and on the other hand that the cultivation of independent work ability is not enough. Are these two statements contradictory? There is no contradiction. Students believe that they have the ability to understand what the teacher has taught. However, because they do not learn thoroughly, their ability to solve new problems is greatly insufficient.

Here, I want to discuss a related issue, which is how many hours of study per week is considered excessive workload. My view is that as long as the student's health does not decline and there are appropriate cultural and sports activities, even if the study is a little tense, it cannot be considered an excessive burden. According to this standard, students can handle up to 60 hours of study per week. Therefore, my opinion is that the workload of each course should be controlled, and 60 hours can be used as a warning line for middle and lower-level students. Of course, students' material living conditions must also be considered, such as the dormitory should not be too crowded and the food should not be too bad. I suggest that the dormitory be expanded a bit to allow for sufficient air. The current scholarship standard should also be increased by about three yuan per person per month to allow for more adequate nutrition. Under these conditions, 60 hours of study per week can only be said to be intense, not excessive. If it exceeds 60 hours, it is likely to become excessive.

According to the current five-year teaching plan and the existing teaching syllabus (not aiming for excessive depth, nor aiming for excessive shallowness), can middle and lower-level students learn thoroughly and consolidate within the controlled number of hours of 60 hours per week, and can they be given appropriate independent work ability? Judging from the situation at Jiaotong University, because there are still a very few teachers with relatively poor lecturing efficiency, because teaching methods must continue to be improved, and because we want to maintain an appropriate depth within the scope of our current teaching syllabus, it is still somewhat difficult. Therefore, I think it is appropriate to reduce the teaching plan, but excessive reduction will hinder the policy of cultivating specialists. So I say that the teaching plan should only be slightly reduced. As for the imbalance in the level of teachers and students in various schools, the depth of the teaching syllabus can be controlled appropriately.

Secondly, the problem of exercise classes should be mentioned. Among all the links after the teaching reform, if there are individual problematic links, the first problematic one should be exercises. At Jiaotong University, individual teaching assistants (who are in charge of exercise classes) have worked hard in exercise classes, conducted in-depth research and practice, and summarized a set of "relatively complete experience", but when this set of experience was promoted, many problems occurred due to the different levels of students and the different abilities of teachers.

Everyone generally reflects that exercise classes do not solve problems. Students with better grades even think that exercise classes are a waste of time, while students with the worst grades think that they are useless. Jiaotong University originally planned to change part of the exercise time for some courses to lectures by lecturers in large classes starting from next semester. In this way, we believe that efficiency can be improved because higher-level teachers are in charge of explaining examples. Therefore, I personally fully agree with the proposition of appropriately reducing exercise classes.

Again, the problem of oral examinations should be mentioned. Oral examinations have their advantages. The most important of these is that they enable students to review systematically, thereby achieving the effect of consolidating learning. But on the other hand, the level of tension of students during oral examinations is indescribable. At Jiaotong University, individual students have records of losing 13 pounds of weight after the examination (oral examination), and losing two or three pounds is even more common. This summer, Jiaotong University was forced to suspend examinations because the students were too nervous during the oral examination period and could not resist the influenza epidemic in the city.

Of course, there are many reasons for the excessive tension of students during oral examinations. Not being able to consolidate learning at ordinary times is one of the main reasons. The excessive emphasis on collectivism in advanced collectives (excellent classes) is also one of the reasons. In addition, the living conditions are relatively poor and the nutrition is not enough, which leads to weight loss and inability to resist infectious diseases. Therefore, although oral examinations have their advantages in teaching, because excessive tension is harmful to health, it is worthy of our attention and discussion. My personal opinion is that the examination time for the semester or academic year can be reduced, and oral examinations and written examinations can be used jointly according to the different nature of the courses to reduce the students' tension. I think the evaluation of advanced collectives (excellent classes) can be postponed. Of course, the fundamental solution still depends on the consolidation of learning in peacetime.

Jiaotong University will summarize the experience of the four-year teaching reform next semester. The school-wide summary has not yet begun. The above are just my personal opinions. I hope the comrades in the higher education department will correct me.

    我对教学改革中几个问题的意见
    交通大学教务长　陈大燮
    自从1952年调整院系并进行教学改革以来，交通大学已经从一个旧型的培养通才的学校，转变为一所培养全面发展的专业人才的学府。在已往四年教学改革的过程中，经过全校教师和学生的努力，在党和政府的正确领导下，在苏联专家热忱的帮助下，交通大学在培养人才方面获得了很大的成绩，但是也存在着不少的缺点，而且应该说是发展中的缺点。
    在交通大学的教学改革成绩中，我只举出一点。在交通大学最近举行的动力机械制造专业的国家考试的会议上，主持会议的某企业总工程师，肯定地说，毕业设计的水平逐年有所提高，今年的水平可以相当于该企业的主任设计员，也就是相当于已往的毕业生担任了三年工作以后的程度。交通大学今年毕业的还是四年制的，以后五年制毕业的学生的水平当然还可以更高一些。但是这位总工程师，也提出了交通大学毕业生的某些缺点，就是在毕业设计中工艺性和经济性的部分，掌握得还不够。这正是交通大学需要努力改进的地方。其他专业的情况，也大致类似。
    这里要连带地讲到一个问题，就是基础课同专业课的比重问题。有些同志认为在工科的高等学校，专业课的比重还可以大大地减轻，而基础课的比重，则还可以增加一些。我不同意这样的看法。过分的减少专业课（指主要的专业课），是或多或少地走向恢复培养通才的道路，使得毕业的学生，必须在工厂中继续学习一个时期，才能担当负责的工作，这同我国大规模工业建设、迫切需要负责技术干部的情况是不相适应的。但是为了更好地向科学进军并解决数和量之间的矛盾，我认为由校同校之间的分工，或者在同一学校内用选课的方式，对某些学生作更高深的基本科学知识的培养，这当然是可以的。这种分工的方法，并不意味着专才培养方向的改变，而是专才方向培养的更加具体化。
    这里我还要提到关于业务教学上的几个问题。
    首先要提到的是学生的负担问题。交通大学过去一年中，学校所掌握的学生每周学习时数，是以五十七小时作为警戒线。凡是班级中中等程度的学生，学习时间超过五十七小时的，有关系和教务处，就要对这个班级的学习分量加以研究并设法减轻。有个别班级，达到六十小时的，则予以紧急调整。在过去一年中，除了毕业班最后阶段的毕业设计以外，达到六十小时的，只是极个别的班级，而且也是在极短时间内的。超过五十七小时警戒线的班级也是极少数。极大多数的班级，极大部分的时间，每周学习时数在五十四小时左右。根据上面的数字看来，在交通大学，学生负担过重的问题可以说是不存在的，至少是不严重的。但是是否已经解决了学生负担过重的问题了呢？绝对没有。学生负担过重的原因，从交通大学来看，主要的有三个：即习题和课外作业花的时间多，实验和作报告花的时间多，以及某些讲课教师的讲课效率不够高。最后一个因素，影响最为严重。交通大学还有5％弱的讲课教师，讲课效率比较差，对学生负担的影响就很大。我们所采取的方法，是对任何一个班级，不使他们有多于一门的讲课由效率比较差的教师担任。但是即使只有一门讲课效率比较差的教师，每周就使学生不必要地增加好几个小时的学习时间，甚至有超过十小时的。关于习题和课外作业，以及实验和作报告这两个因素，则是我们控制学生负担现阶段的两个主要方面。某个班级如果负担超过了警戒线，则把他们产生较重负担的那一门课程的习题和课外作业减少一些，实验和报告简化一些。我们也提出减轻习题和课外作业，必须同时减少讲课内容，但是任课教师一般是很少这样做的，大多数是单单减少习题的分量。这样做的结果怎样呢？由于习题分量的减少，学生所学到的，没有足够的巩固，也妨害了进一步独立思考能力的培养。由于实验方法和报告的简化，使得某些实验，变成填数字、填表格，内容枯燥，学生得益极少。在一般没有课程设计的课程中，除了讲课的系统性和启发性以外，习题和实验，是培养学生独立工作的两条大道。现在两条大道都不能畅行无阻，独立工作能力的培养当然就要大打折扣了。所以可以这样说，负担是不重了，而所付的代价是巨大的，即削弱了对学生独立工作能力的培养。
    在上个学期开始的时候，在交通大学发现了这样一个严重的缺点，但是在学习时间、讲授分量、作业以及实验分量的相互矛盾中，我们还没有找到适当的出路。个别的教研组，如力学教研组，曾经对习题分量的问题作了较深入的研究。他们的结论是，影响学生独立工作能力的，不光是习题分量的问题，也同习题内容的性质有关系。如何由浅入深，如何同讲课作密切配合，都是极重要的。换句话说，如何对习题的内容作适当的布置和安排，使学生能在比较经济的时间内，得到最有效的培养，也是一个不折不扣的教学法问题。教学法的改进和分量的适当充实，是应该采取的改进方法。在实验课上和在课程设计课上，都是这样。
    我一方面讲，教学改革以后业务质量有很大的提高，另一方面又讲，对独立工作能力培养得不够，这两种说法有矛盾吗？是没有矛盾的。学生们认为教师教过的东西，是有能力去理解的。但是因为学得不透，对新问题解决的能力，就大大地不够了。
    这里要连带讨论一个问题，即每周学习多少时数才叫学习负担过重。我的看法是只要学生的健康情况不下降，有适当的文娱体育活动，就是学习紧张一些，也不能认为负担过重。根据这个标准，每周学习六十小时以下，学生是可以负担的。所以我的意见，系掌握各课程作业分量，对于中下程度的学生是可以用六十小时作为警戒线的。当然也要考虑到学生的物质生活条件，如宿舍不要太挤，伙食不要太差。我建议宿舍要放宽一些，使有足够的空气。现在的助学金标准也要提高一些，约每人每月提高三元，使有比较充分的营养。在这样的条件下，每周学习六十小时，是只能说是紧张，而不能说是过重的。如果超过六十小时，就很可能变为过重了。
    现有的五年制的教学计划，根据现有的教学大纲（不向过深的看齐，也不向过浅的看齐），按照中下程度的学生，能否在每周控制时数六十小时以内，学得透、学得巩固，并且能使得到适当的独立工作能力的培养，就交通大学的情况看来，由于还有极少数讲课效率比较差的教师担任讲课，由于教学法还必须继续改进，由于我们现行的教学大纲的范围内，要维持适当的深度，还是有些困难。因此教学计划的适当减轻，我认为是应该的，但过分的减轻，又要妨害专才培养的方针。所以我说，教学计划只要作些微的减轻。至于各校教师、学生水平的不平衡，可以掌握教学大纲的深度，来作适当的控制。
    其次要提到的，是习题课的问题。教学改革以后的各个环节中，假使其中有个别有问题的环节的话，第一个有问题的就应该是习题。交通大学曾经有个别助教（担任习题课的）对习题课下过苦功，做过一番深入的研究和实践，总结出一套“较完整的经验”，但是当推广这套经验的时候，由于学生水平和教师能力的不同，就发生很多的问题。
    大家一般反映，认为习题课不解决问题。程度比较好的学生甚至认为习题课是浪费时间，程度最差的学生，又认为是无济于事。交通大学原拟从下学期起把某些课程的部分习题时间，改为由讲课教师在大班上讲授例题。这样，由于有较高水平的教师来担任例题的讲解，我们认为是可以提高效率的。所以我个人完全同意适当减少习题课的主张。
    再次要提到的，是口试的问题。口试有它的优越性。其中最主要的，是使学生能有系统的复习，因而获得巩固学习的效果。但是另一方面，口试的时候，学生的紧张程度，是不可言状的。交通大学个别的学生在考试（口试）以后，有体重减轻十三磅的纪录，减重二、三磅的更是常事。今年暑期交通大学就因为口试期间学习过分紧张，不能抵抗市上的流行性感冒，因而被迫停考。
    当然造成口试时学生过分紧张的原因是多方面的。平时学习没有能巩固是主要原因之一。先进集体（优秀班）的过分强调集体，也是原因之一。加上居住条件比较差，营养也不够，以致体重减轻、不能抵抗流行性疾病。所以口试尽管在教学上有它的优越性，既因为过分紧张对健康有害，就值得我们注意商讨。我个人的看法，认为可以减少学期或者学年的考试时间，并且把口试和笔试，根据课程性质的不同联合应用，以减轻学生的紧张程度。对于先进集体（优秀班）的评选，我认为可以暂缓推行。当然，根本的解决，还有待于学习上平时的巩固。
    交通大学将在下学期总结四年制教学改革的经验，现在全校性的总结还没有开始，以上只是我个人的看法，希望高等教育部门的同志们指正。
