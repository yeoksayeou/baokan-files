Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 15th: Three female intellectuals, Xie Zhiyuan, Cai Xiuxia, and Qiu Yufeng, recently left their small family circles and formed a group in the Shanghai No. 1 Light Industry Bureau's laboratory to begin special research work on improving ink quality.

    Fifty-two-year-old Xie Zhiyuan is a Ph.D. in physical chemistry who studied in Germany and has served as a university chemistry professor and leader of a pharmaceutical factory appraisal team. In recent years, she had been idle at home. Cai Xiuxia studied biochemistry in the United States. Qiu Yufeng is a graduate of the Chemistry Department of Hujiang University. For a long time, they had been unemployed, or working in jobs unrelated to their fields of study, and later became housewives.

    When they were invited by the No. 1 Light Industry Bureau to participate in work and pick up experimental instruments again, they all felt unspeakable joy.

    Like Xie Zhiyuan and the others, in the past few months, many unemployed and jobless intellectuals in Shanghai have taken up jobs. Ni Mengjie, who had served as a professor of electrical engineering at universities at home and abroad for many years and had been living at home due to illness before liberation, has been invited to the Production Technology Department of the Shanghai No. 2 Heavy Industry Bureau as an engineer and has been rated as a first-class engineer. More than 40 unemployed and jobless senior professionals proficient in foreign languages such as English, Russian, German, French, and Japanese, and more than 120 accountants proficient in accounting, have been invited to work by the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute and various professional bureaus and companies in Shanghai.

    The CPPCC and the organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai are currently in contact with more than 2,000 social intellectuals, helping them to improve their understanding and create employment conditions.

    上海许多社会知识分子走上工作岗位
    新华社上海15日电　三位女知识分子谢志媛、蔡绣霞、裘毓葑，最近一道走出了家庭的小天地，在上海市第一轻工业局试验室里组成了一个小组，开始从事改进油墨质量的专题研究工作。
    五十二岁的谢志媛是留德的物理化学博士，曾经担任过大学化学教授和制药厂鉴定组组长等职务。最近几年来，她一直闲居家中。蔡绣霞曾留学美国学生物化学。裘毓葑是沪江大学化学系毕业生。长时期来，她们失过业，或者学非所用地工作过，后来都成为家庭主妇。
    当她们被第一轻工业局请去参加工作，重新拿起实验仪器的时候，都感到有说不出的愉快。
    像谢志媛她们一样，最近几个月中，上海已有许多社会上的失业、无业的知识分子走上了工作岗位。曾在国内外大学担任过多年电机学教授、解放前因病家居的倪孟杰，已被请到上海市第二重工业局生产技术处担任工程师工作，并被评为一等一级工程师。失业、无业的四十多位精通英、俄、德、法、日等外国语言文字的高级专门人才和一百二十多位精通会计业务的会计师，已分别被上海外国语学院和上海市各专业局、专业公司请去工作。
    政协和各民主党派在上海的组织，目前还联系着二千多个社会知识分子，帮助他们提高认识，创造就业条件。
