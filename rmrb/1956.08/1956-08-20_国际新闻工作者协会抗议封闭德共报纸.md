Xinhua News Agency, August 19th, dispatch from Prague via TASS on August 19th: The International Organization of Journalists issued a protest telegram to the West German government on August 18th.

The telegram stated: Recent events in the Federal Republic of Germany, particularly the trial in Karlsruhe and the banning of the German Communist Party, are deeply disturbing to democratic figures worldwide.

The telegram pointed out that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has grossly violated freedom of opinion, especially freedom of the press. Journalists reflecting views disliked by the Adenauer government are subjected to increasingly severe persecution. This movement against freedom of the press has now developed into the closure of twenty Communist newspapers. The telegram condemned this, saying: This practice can only be regarded as a mockery of freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, and a gross violation of human rights.

    国际新闻工作者协会抗议封闭德共报纸
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社布拉格十九日讯：国际新闻工作者协会八月十八日发表了给西德政府的抗议电。
    电报说：德意志联邦共和国近来发生的事件，特别是卡尔斯卢厄的审讯和禁止德国共产党使全世界民主的社会人士深感不安。
    电报指出，德意志联邦共和国政府极其粗暴地侵犯了舆论自由，首先是出版自由。反映了阿登纳政府所不喜欢的看法的记者受到越来越厉害的迫害。现在这个反对出版自由的运动已经发展到封闭二十家共产党报纸。电报就此谴责说：这种做法只能被认为是对出版自由、舆论自由的嘲弄和对人权的粗暴侵犯。
