Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 16th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru expressed his hope on August 15th that the London Conference will be able to find a way to peacefully and amicably resolve the Suez Canal crisis, which has become a "serious threat to the world."

Speaking at a large-scale gathering at the Red Fort in Delhi on the morning of the day to commemorate the ninth anniversary of India's independence, Nehru warned that if any country, even mistakenly, tries to resolve the Suez issue by force or threats, it will have tragic consequences and cause a huge disaster that could spread to the whole world.

Nehru also said: "I hope that if the Suez Canal issue is not resolved at the London Conference, then a second or even a third attempt will be made to resolve this issue only through peaceful means."

When talking about the prospects of the London Conference, Nehru said: "I hope that on this issue (the Suez Canal issue), through the consideration of those gathered in London and through the suggestions of our Egyptian friends, some kind of solution can be found on the basis of mutual trust that every country can accept willingly and amicably. This is very important, because only those decisions in which neither party wants to condemn, despise or demean the other are good decisions. If you condemn, despise or demean the other party, then you are sowing the seeds of war and conflict. On the other hand, if decisions are made on a friendly basis, then this decision can last."

He pointed out, "We must remember at this moment when the world is threatened that only solutions based on friendship and understanding are lasting solutions. Our world is a world with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and we cannot be complacent or careless."

At the beginning of his speech, Nehru congratulated the Indian people on the ninth anniversary of India's freedom. He said: "A new star has appeared in the sky of the world—the star of free India. It is a new star, and it is also an old star. It is made of the sacrifices and hard work of the people, and it is made of their blood and sweat. But it has a new color and a new face derived from Gandhi."

Nehru said that thousands of years ago, India spread the message of Panchsheel to the world. But today this Indian term has a new meaning and is known all over the world. The message embodied in this term stipulates how two countries should treat each other and how they should maintain their relationship with each other. This message has spread and has been accepted by many countries, because in fact the world has no other choice but to choose between war and total destruction or peace and Panchsheel. There is no third way.

    尼赫鲁在印度独立纪念会上发出警告
    反对用武力或威胁解决苏彝士问题
    希望伦敦会议根据埃及的建议找出各国都能接受的办法
    新华社新德里16日电　印度总理尼赫鲁八月十五日表示希望，伦敦会议将能找出和平和友好地解决已经形成“对世界的严重威胁”的苏彝士运河危机的办法。
    尼赫鲁这一天上午在德里红堡对纪念印度独立九周年的一个大规模集会发表演说时警告说，如果任何国家那怕是出于错误试图用武力或威胁来解决苏彝士问题，那么这将会产生悲惨的结果，引起可能扩大到全世界的巨大灾难。
    尼赫鲁还说：“我希望，如果苏彝士运河问题在伦敦会议上得不到解决，那么将作出第二次甚至第三次尝试，以便只通过和平手段来解决这个问题。”
    在谈到伦敦会议的前景的时候，尼赫鲁说：“我希望，在这个问题（苏彝士运河问题）上，将会通过在伦敦集会的人们的考虑和通过我们的埃及朋友们的建议，在相互信任的基础上找出每个国家都能欣然地和友好地接受的某种办法。这是很重要的，因为只有任何一方都不想谴责、蔑视或贬损他方的那些决定才是好的决定。如果你谴责、蔑视或贬损他方，那你就散布了战争和冲突的种子。另一方面，如果决定是在友好的基础上作出的，那么这个决定就能持久。”
    他指出，“我们在这种世界受到威胁的时刻必须记住，只有基于友谊和谅解的解决办法才是持久的解决办法。我们的世界是拥有原子弹和氢弹的世界，我们可不能洋洋自得或漫不经心。”
    尼赫鲁在演说开始时祝贺印度人民过印度自由九周年纪念日。他说：“在世界的天空上出现了一颗新的星——自由印度之星，它是新的星，也是旧的星，它是由人民的牺牲和艰苦努力铸成的，是由他们的血汗铸成的。但是它具有得自甘地的一种新的色彩和新的面貌。”
    尼赫鲁说，数千年以前，印度就向世界传播了潘查希拉的信息。但是今天这个印度名词具有了新的意义并且是举世闻名了。这个名词所体现的信息规定了两个国家彼此之间应该如何对待以及它们应该如何保持彼此之间的关系。这个信息已经传播开了，并且已经为许多国家所接受，因为实际上这个世界除了在战争和全部毁灭或者和平和潘查希拉这两者之间任择其一以外没有别的办法。第三条道路是不存在的。
