Haikou City: A Base for Developing Hainan Island

	Hai Ping, Qiu Bo

With the development of the construction of Hainan Island, Haikou City, the political, economic, and cultural center of Hainan Island, is also changing day by day. The urban area has expanded, and new office buildings for state organs, factory buildings, staff dormitories, and school buildings have been built along the highways from Haikou to Xiuying Wharf and from Haikou to Fu Town. The city's population has increased from more than 80,000 at the time of liberation to more than 130,000. In the past, ships had to anchor more than ten *li* away from the city center in the sea; now, ships of about a thousand tons can directly berth at the newly built Xiuying Port Wharf. Goods and passengers no longer need to be transported by small boats.

Haikou City is located at the northern end of Hainan Island, only eighteen nautical miles away from the Leizhou Peninsula. Three main highways run through all parts of the island, and goods from the motherland are distributed here. From Haikou City, there are flights to Zhanjiang and Guangzhou every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and large ships can directly reach Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other places.

In order to cooperate with the construction of Hainan Island, Haikou City's industry is also booming. The thirteen dilapidated factories in the city in the past have all been expanded, and five new factories have been built, including a cannery, a bone meal factory, and a match factory. The production capacity of the newly built and expanded factories has increased several times or even dozens of times compared to the past. For example, the Hainan Machinery Factory has increased from a few old lathes to more than forty lathes, twenty-one of which are the latest Soviet-style lathes. Now it can not only repair tractors and steam engines, but also manufacture various new agricultural implements, machine water pumps, drilling tools, and pressing machines and oil presses specially supplied to rubber plantations, as well as sugar-making machines. The Haikou Cannery, which recently went into production, can produce 25,000 cans of pineapple preserves every day.

The streets of Haikou City and the highways in the suburbs have been renovated into flat and wide asphalt or cement roads, and coconut trees and other trees have been planted on both sides of the highways. All thirty-nine sewage ditches in the city have also been dredged. In the past six years, the government has also built many public entertainment venues and renovated scenic spots and historical sites. The newly built Peace Theater is one of the most beautiful buildings in Haikou City.

Hainan Island is a treasure island waiting to be developed. Every day, more than 100 cars loaded with experts, scientific researchers, survey team members, and various construction materials and industrial products drive from Haikou to all parts of the island, and from all parts of the island, coconuts, betel nuts, rattan, pineapples, and various tropical cash crops are continuously transported to Haikou and transferred to the mainland of the motherland. The Wuzhi Mountain area and coastal areas where ethnic minorities live are also closely linked to Haikou City. At present, Hainan Island's rubber industry, fishery, salt industry, and mining industry have a considerable foundation. With the development of the construction cause, Haikou City will become more prosperous day by day. (Attached picture)

    开发海南岛的基地—海口市
    海萍  秋波
    随着海南岛建设事业的发展，海南岛政治、经济、文化的中心——海口市的面貌，也一天天在改变。市区扩大了，一幢幢崭新的国家机关办公大楼、工厂厂房、职工宿舍和学校的房屋，都沿着海口到秀英码头和海口到府城镇的公路建立起来。全市人口已经由解放时的八万多人增加到十三万多人。过去轮船要下碇在距市区中心十多华里的大海中；现在，千吨左右的轮船可以直靠新建的秀英港码头。货物和旅客再也不必用小艇驳运了。
    海口市在海南岛的北端，同雷州半岛相隔只十八浬，有三条干线公路贯通全岛各地，从祖国大陆来的货物，都要经过这里集散。从海口市每逢星期一、三、五，有飞机飞往湛江和广州、大轮船可直通马来亚、印度尼西亚、越南等地。
    为了配合海南岛的建设，海口市的工业也在蓬勃发展。过去全市十三座破烂不堪的工厂，已经全部扩建了，并新建了罐头厂、牛骨粉厂、火柴厂等五座工厂。新建和扩建后的工厂，生产能力比以前增加了几倍甚至几十倍。例如海南机械厂，从过去的几部旧车床，增加到四十多部车床，其中有二十一部是苏联最新式的车床，现在不但能修理拖拉机、蒸气机，还可以制造各种新式农具、机器抽水机、打井工具和专门供应橡胶垦殖场使用的压胶机、榨油机，以及制糖机器。最近投入生产的海口市罐头厂，每天能制造二万五千罐菠萝罐头。
    海口市的街道和市郊的公路都已翻修，成为平坦宽阔的柏油路或水泥路，在公路两旁栽种了椰子树和其他各种树木。市内三十九条污水沟也已全部疏通。六年来，政府还先后修建了许多公共娱乐场所，修缮了名胜古迹。新建的和平戏院是海口市最漂亮的建筑物之一。
    海南岛是正待开发的宝岛，每天，都有一百多部汽车满载着专家、科学研究工作者、勘察队员和各种建设器材、各种工业品从海口开往全岛各地，又从各地把椰子、槟榔、红白藤、菠萝以及各种热带经济作物源源运到海口，转运往祖国大陆。少数民族聚居的五指山区和沿海地区也因此和海口市紧密地联成一片了。现在海南岛的橡胶业、渔业、盐业和矿业都已经有了相当的基础，随着开发建设事业的发展，海口市也将一天比一天更加繁荣起来。（附图片）
