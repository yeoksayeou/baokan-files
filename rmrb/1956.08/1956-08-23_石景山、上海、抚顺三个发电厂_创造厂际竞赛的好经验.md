Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The inter-factory friendship competition among the Shijingshan, Shanghai Yangshupu, and Fushun power plants has proven to be a practical and effective form of inter-factory competition for exchanging advanced experiences among factories of the same type.

The characteristics of this competition form are: the competition involves only a few factories of the same type, and the focus of the competition is on exchanging experiences rather than on evaluation. These three power plants are all large thermal power plants. Since the competition began in the first quarter of this year, these three factories have held a competition summary and exchange meeting every quarter to exchange advanced experiences. Before the meeting, the three factories mutually notify each other in writing of the advanced experiences they need to learn and can provide. Each factory sends a delegation including skilled workers, engineers, and management cadres who can both learn and introduce experiences, led by the factory负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge/head) to participate in the meeting hosted by the factory serving as the meeting chairman. During the meeting, advanced experiences are exchanged through professional discussions, reports, and on-site demonstrations and observations. At other times, the factories also exchange technical data with each other and organize individual visits centered around specific issues.

Since the start of the competition, these three factories have exchanged hundreds of advanced experiences, greatly improving their production levels.

The power industry system began organizing inter-factory competitions several years ago. However, many factories participated, and the focus of the competition was on winning prizes. The production conditions of each factory were inconsistent, and the competition summary meeting actually became an evaluation meeting, and the exchange of experiences became a mere formality. Starting from the fourth quarter of last year, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the National Committee of the China Electrical Engineering Trade Union began to select three or four similar types of power plants based on production scale and equipment conditions to organize this form of inter-factory friendship competition separately.

    石景山、上海、抚顺三个发电厂
    创造厂际竞赛的好经验
    参加竞赛的是少数几个条件相近的工厂，竞赛重点放在交流经验上，而不在评比方面。
    新华社21日讯　石景山、上海杨树浦和抚顺三个发电厂之间开展的厂际友谊竞赛，已被证明是交流先进经验的一种切实有效的同工种厂际竞赛形式。
    这种竞赛形式的特点是：参加竞赛的是少数几个同类型的工厂，竞赛重点放在交流经验上，而不在评比方面。这三个发电厂都是较大的火力发电厂。从今年第一季开展竞赛后，这三个厂每季举行一次竞赛总结交流会议，交流先进经验。会前，三个厂由书面相互通知自己需要学习的和能够提供的先进经验。各厂都派出包括既能学习又能介绍经验的技术工人、工程师和管理干部的代表团，由工厂负责人率领到担任会议主席的工厂参加会议。会议期间，采取专业座谈、报告和现场表演观摩等方式，交流先进经验。在平时，各厂之间还相互交流技术资料，按问题组织个别的参观访问。
    这三个厂自开展竞赛以来，都有成百件先进经验，相互之间进行交流，大大提高了生产水平。
    电力工业系统中，几年前就开始组织厂际竞赛。但是，参加的工厂多，竞赛的重点是放在比赛优胜上。各厂生产条件不一致，竞赛总结会议实际上变成评比会议，交流经验流于形式。从去年第四季起，电力工业部和中国电业工会全国委员会就开始按生产规模、设备条件、选择三几个同类型的发电厂在一起，分别组织开展这种形式的厂际友谊竞赛。
