    What Kind of Business is This?
    Xiao Wen
    After climbing Qingcheng Mountain for a day, I passed through Guanxian city on the way back, and everyone eagerly hoped to have a delicious dinner there. Unfortunately, after running through all the streets of the city, large and small restaurants alike had a sign hanging at the door—"Closed." It was said that the next business hours would be after 7:00 PM at night. Why not open during the day? Looking at the clock, I suddenly realized that it was already the time for government offices to close—5:30 PM. It seems that the restaurant's business hours were aligned with the working hours of government offices.
    However, strange things in the world often come in pairs. Two days later, I went to a joint state-private Western medicine store in Chengdu to buy medicine. Two staff members were sitting in the store chatting. Although there was no "Closed" sign hanging, they were not doing business because it was already lunchtime. When talking to a comrade about these unpleasant things, who knew he would say: This is nothing special! It is said that in some places, even pedicabs stop pulling at the appointed time, without the slightest ambiguity.
    What kind of business is this? Is it capitalist? No, it isn't. Capitalists are smart; they would never do such foolish things. Is it socialist? Who would believe it! Let us imagine for those who excessively believe in unified working hours what the result would be if everyone's working hours were unified. At 5:30 PM, the quitting time bell rings, and he walks out of the office with his briefcase, but the car driver is already resting. Taking public transport, a trolley happens to be parked in front of his door, and it will not continue to run until tomorrow morning. Dragging his tired body home, the baby is crying in the cradle, with a half-bottle of milk on the table; the nanny has already left work. At the same time, the telephone is not working, the lights are dim, and the tap water is cut off... Enough, no need to imagine more. In short, how can this be socialism? Recently, in the handicraft cooperatives in Chengdu, large slogans are hung everywhere: "Launch a labor competition, and run into socialism!" Whether this slogan is entirely appropriate is not discussed here for the moment, but if people are told that this is socialism, many people's legs would probably weaken, and no one would want to run into such a society.
    Readers must be very eager to know the creators of these miracles. As far as I know, the unreasonable arrangement of business hours in the catering industry in Guanxian is mainly due to the Guanxian People's Committee's failure to implement the central and Sichuan province's instructions on retaining the original management methods of industry and commerce. The change in business hours in the Chengdu Western medicine store was not right. I asked a vice director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce, and he said: We have no right to change it; this is entirely stipulated by the professional company.
    In order to correct these unreasonable phenomena, we must start from two aspects: the commercial departments of various places must correctly implement the spirit of the central government; and the various professional companies of the commercial sector must give local areas more rights and not manage them too rigidly—including business hours.

    这是什么经营方式
    肖文
    爬了一天青城山，归途中路过灌县城，大家都热望着在这里吃到一餐可口的晚饭。不幸得很，跑遍了城里的大街，无论大小饭馆，门口都挂着一块牌子——休息。据说，下一次的营业时间，在夜间七点钟以后。为什么大白天不营业？看看时钟，恍然大悟，原来已经到了机关下班的时间——五点半。大概饭馆的营业时间，是同机关工作时间取齐了。
    然而，天下奇事无独有偶。过了两天，我到成都一家公私合营的西药店里买药。两个工作人员坐在店里谈天，虽然没挂“休息”的牌子，但也不作买卖，原因是已经到了中午休息时间。同一位同志谈起这些不愉快的事，谁知他说：这算什么稀奇！据说有些地方的三轮车，也是到点停拉，一丝都不含糊。
    这是什么经营方式呢？是资本主义的吗？不是的。资本家聪明得很，一定不作这些傻事。是社会主义的吗？谁敢相信呢！我们且替那些过分迷信统一工作时间的发号施令者设想一下，如果大家的工作时间都统一起来了，结果将是怎样的呢？下午五点半，下班铃响了，他挟着皮包走出办公室，可是汽车司机已经休息了。乘坐公共交通工具吧，恰好一辆电车停在他的门口，明天早晨才继续开动。拖着疲乏的身子到了家，婴儿正在摇床上哭，装着半瓶奶汁的奶瓶放在桌上；保姆已经下班了。在这同一时间里，电话不通，电灯不明，自来水中断……。够了，不用多设想了。总之，这怎么能是社会主义呢？最近，在成都的手工业合作社里，到处都悬挂着这样的大字口号：“展开劳动竞赛，跑步进入社会主义！”这个口号是否完全适当，这里姑且不谈，反正如果告诉人们，这就是社会主义，许多人的腿大概就会软了，谁也不愿意跑进这样的社会去。
    读者一定很希望知道这些奇迹的创造者。据我了解，灌县饮食业营业时间安排得不合理，主要是由于灌县人民委员会没有贯彻执行中央和四川省关于保留工商业的原有经营方法的指示。成都西药店的营业时间改的不对头，我问了一位四川省商业厅的副厅长，他说：我们无权改变，这完全是专业公司统一规定的。
    为了纠正这些不合理的现象，必须从两个方面着手：各地方的商业机关，正确地贯彻执行中央的精神；商业部门的各个专业公司，给地方以更多权利，不要管的太死——包括营业时间在内。
