    National Basketball Championship Outcome Largely Decided
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th – After ten days of intense competition at the 1956 National Basketball Championship in Zhengzhou, the champions and runners-up for both the men's and women's groups are largely determined.
    In the women's group, the Beijing Women's Basketball Team has already won seven games out of seven, and it is estimated that they have the best chance of winning the championship. The Tianjin team is most likely to win the women's group runner-up position. In addition to losing to the Beijing team by seven points, they have also defeated teams such as Shanghai and Nanjing.
    In the men's group, both the Lushun-Dalian team and the Shenyang team have not lost a single game so far. According to the competition schedule, these two teams will meet on the last day of the championship – August 28th. Therefore, which team will win the men's group championship will not be determined until the 28th.
    The competition over the past ten days has been very intense. The Nanjing men's team has successively defeated the Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Jinan teams, but the Nanjing team only won a total of four points in these three games. In addition, in the men's group, the Jinan team won against the Shanghai team, and in the women's group, the Tianjin team won against the Shanghai team by only one point. This shows that the level of each team is similar, so it is difficult to predict the rankings of the teams after the champion and runner-up.

    全国篮球锦标赛大局已定
    据新华社郑州26日电　在郑州举行的1956年全国篮球锦标赛经过十天来的紧张比赛，男、女两组的冠军和亚军大体上已经可以肯定。
    在女子组中，北京女子篮球队已经七战七胜，估计她们最有希望夺得冠军。获得女子组亚军的，以天津队的可能性为最大，这个队除了有一场以七分之差败给北京队外，也先后战胜了上海和南京等队。
    男子组中，目前旅大队和沈阳队都一场也没有失败过，按照竞赛日程规定，这两个队相遇的时间是在锦标赛的最后一天——8月28日，所以哪一个队将获得男子组的冠军，须到28日才能确定。
    十天来的比赛是非常紧张的。南京男子队先后打败过青岛队、广州队和济南队，但是南京队在这三场比赛中，总共只净赢了四分，此外，男子组中济南队胜上海队，女子组中天津队胜上海队也都只相差一分。这说明各队的水平都相差不多，因此在冠军、亚军以后的各队的名次还很难预测。
