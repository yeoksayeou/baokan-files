Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Tiqiang reports: How to solve the fertilizer problem next year? Yongning County, Gansu Province, recently convened a meeting of township branch secretaries and township heads to study this issue.

After Yongning County achieved advanced cooperativization this spring, farmers applied all or most of the accumulated human manure and stable manure to the fields. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by more than 4,000 jin compared to previous years. Due to the increase in fertilizer application, the average yield of 100,000 mu of spring wheat in the county this year is 400 jin per mu, an increase of 43% compared to last year. The other 300,000 mu of autumn crops are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected. However, what about next year's fertilizer? Next year, the county plans to sow more than 500,000 mu, an increase of about 15% compared to this year, requiring more fertilizer than this year.

In order to solve the fertilizer problem for next year, the Yongning County Committee of the Communist Party of China sent cadres deep into the masses to understand the sources of fertilizer and the situation of fertilizer accumulation before convening the meeting of township branch secretaries and township heads. They found that there were still many fertilizer sources in the countryside, and farmers had as many as thirteen methods of accumulating fertilizer.

At the meeting of township branch secretaries and township heads, the County Committee, based on its own investigation and research, guided the township branch secretaries and township heads to study the county's fertilizer accumulation problem. Everyone talked about how farmers mainly burn firewood for cooking, leading to a shortage of fertilizer, feed, and fuel. After research, it was considered that agricultural cooperatives could mobilize members to switch from burning grass to burning coal, and use all of this year's straw to make fertilizer, except for a portion reserved for water conservancy projects and livestock. In this way, calculating 300 jin of grass to make fertilizer for one mu, the fertilizer needs of more than 160,000 mu of land can be solved. The county has more than 60,000 large and small livestock. Each animal can accumulate fertilizer for an average of one mu of land per year, solving the fertilizer needs of more than 63,000 mu of land. In addition, the county plans to plant green manure crops such as rape and alfalfa, which can solve the fertilizer needs of more than 21,000 mu of land. These three items alone can solve the fertilizer needs of more than half of the county's land next year. If other regular methods of accumulating fertilizer are added, and the quota system of accumulating fertilizer is promoted to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate fertilizer, everyone feels that the fertilizer problem for the other half of the land is not difficult to solve. For example, if each of the county's 15,700 households burns one "falei" (a type of soil block burned in the stove) while cooking every day, the county can accumulate more than 200,000 jin of soil fertilizer every day.

### 明年肥料不够怎么办  永宁县及早研究解决肥料问题

    明年肥料不够怎么办
    永宁县及早研究解决肥料问题
    新华社兰州19日电　新华社记者王体强报道：明年的肥料问题怎么解决？甘肃省永宁县最近召集乡支部书记、乡长开会研究了这个问题。
    永宁县今年春天实现高级合作化以后，农民将历年积存的人粪、厩肥，全部或大部施在地里了。每亩地施肥量比往年增加四千多斤。由于施肥量增加，今年全县十万亩春小麦平均每亩收四百斤，比去年增产43％，其他三十多万亩秋季作物也生长良好，丰收在望。但是，明年的肥料怎么办呢？明年全县计划播种面积达五十多万亩，比今年增加约15％，需要比今年更多的肥料。
    中共永宁县委会为了解决明年所需肥料问题，在召开乡支书乡长会议以前，曾派干部深入到群众中去了解肥源和积肥情况，发现农村中肥源仍然很多，农民积肥的办法多达十三种。
    在乡支部书记、乡长会议上，县委会根据自己的调查研究，引导乡支部书记和乡长们研究全县积肥问题。大家谈到，由于农民做饭主要是烧柴草，以致肥料、饲料及燃料俱缺，经过研究，认为农业社可发动社员改烧草为烧煤，将今年的禾草除留下一部分作为水利工程及牲畜用草外，全部用来沤制肥料。这样，按三百斤草沤制一亩肥料计算，即可解决十六万多亩地的肥料。全县有六万多头大小牲畜，每头每年平均积一亩地肥料，可解决六万三千多亩地肥料。另外，全县计划种植的芸芥、苜蓿等绿肥作物，又可解决两万一千多亩地的肥料问题。仅以上三项，即可使全县明年一半以上土地所需肥料获得解决。如果再加上其他经常的积肥办法，并推广定额积肥，充分发挥社员积肥的积极性，大家感到另一半土地的肥料问题也不难解决。例如，全县一万五千七百多农户，如果每户每天在做饭时烧一个垡垒（一种在锅灶内烧的土块），全县每天就可积土肥二十多万斤。
