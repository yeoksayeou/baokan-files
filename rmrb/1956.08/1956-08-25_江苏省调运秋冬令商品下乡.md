Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 23rd. State-owned commercial departments in Jiangsu Province are transferring large quantities of autumn and winter goods to the countryside in preparation for supply during the peak season market after the autumn harvest.

Among the goods transferred to the countryside, many new varieties have been added, and many products have been improved based on consumer feedback. There are more than 100 new varieties of towels, children's hats, and blankets supplied to the countryside. The new double-yarn towels produced in Changzhou have had their weft density increased from 10-count yarn to 15-count yarn to improve durability. The children's flannel pants produced in Wuxi have been opened at the crotch and have suspenders added, making them more comfortable for children to wear. The Nantong State-owned Department Store also sent people to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places to purchase a large number of over 1,000 new commodities such as velvet flowers, face powder, and hair clips to supply to rural women.

Jiangsu Province's total wheat output this year has increased compared to last year, and the early rice harvest of double-cropping rice has been very good. The early rice harvest in some areas affected by typhoons can still catch up with last year. The mid-season rice, late-season rice, cotton, and other crops that suffered from typhoon disasters are now growing well, and rural sideline production has also basically recovered. Farmers are demanding more and better autumn and winter goods than last year.

The province's state-owned commercial departments plan to increase the total sales amount of goods in the second half of the year by more than 30% compared to the same period last year. The sales plan for rural-appropriate floral gabardine, deep-colored cloth, and other patterned fabrics, as well as undershirts and trousers, bed sheets, and woolen yarn, will increase by 47% to 80% compared to the same period last year.

    江苏省调运秋冬令商品下乡
    新华社南京23日电　江苏省国营商业部门调运大量秋冬令商品下乡，准备在秋收后旺季市场上供应。
    调运下乡的商品中，增加了很多新品种，还有不少是根据消费者意见改进后的产品。供应农村的毛巾、童帽和线毯等商品中新品种就有一百多种。常州生产的新产品双纱毛巾，经密度由十支纱改为十五支纱，加强了牢度。无锡生产的儿童绒裤开了裤裆，加上了背带，使儿童穿了舒畅。南通市国营百货公司还派人到扬州、镇江等地采购了大批绒花、香粉、发夹等一千多种新商品，供应农村妇女。
    江苏省今年的麦子总产量比去年增加，双季稻的早稻收成很好，部分遭受台风侵袭的早稻收成仍可以赶上去年，各地受到台风灾害的中稻、晚稻和棉花等农作物现在生长良好，农村副业生产也基本恢复，农民要求比去年供应更多更好的秋冬令商品。
    全省国营商业部门计划下半年商品销售总金额比去年同期增加30％以上，适销农村的花哔叽、深花布等花色布和卫生衫裤、床单、毛线的销售计划比去年同期增加47％到80％。
