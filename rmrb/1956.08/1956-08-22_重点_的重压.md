The Heavy Burden of "Key Projects"
    Yan Nong

    Anyone who has read "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" and regularly reads the People's Daily will know that Jianming Agricultural, Forestry and Livestock Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is famous for its "thrift in running the cooperative." After the Jianming Production Cooperative became famous, a distorted "upsurge" emerged in the cooperative – "Comrades" (as the cooperative members called the staff from various government agencies) constantly poured into Xishilipu Village, where the Jianming Production Cooperative was located, from all directions. In the small, uneven streets of this small mountain village with only a hundred and several dozen households, there was a constant flow of people and vehicles, truly an unprecedented "new atmosphere."

    Take May 15th of this year, for example. According to Comrade Li Jizeng, the resident guidance worker in the township, a total of 49 guests ate at the cooperative that day. According to my incomplete memory, there were 14 people from the Land Planning Group of the Ministry of Agriculture (they worked here for twenty days), accompanied by one staff member from the Zunhua Newspaper Office who was studying with them; a photographer from a film studio had just left, and a writer experiencing life remained; a reporter from the China Youth Daily was here for interviews; Comrade Chen Qingshan, the county party secretary, stayed here to delve into the grassroots with a correspondent; a cadre from the county education section's literacy office came to organize literacy work, assisted by the general principal of the district's people's school; Secretary Chen of the County Communist Youth League and three others, along with five people from the district agricultural technology station, were jointly organizing an agricultural technology school; three people from the county public security bureau were also staying here, specifically to implement Articles 4 and 5 of the "National Agricultural Development Program"; there were also two comrades from the water conservancy section, responsible for guiding the construction of canals; three people from the county health院(hospital) and the district health workers' association were also here to promote the new method of childbirth and hold health picture exhibitions; two other people from the district health workers' association were studying the issue of establishing a clinic; in addition, there were two people from the county cultural center, one helping with the club, and one specifically teaching folk dances; and… forgive me for not remembering clearly.

    Forty-nine people may have been the largest number of people at this period. Because this cooperative has not established a registration system for visiting guests, and the cooperative cadres and members are busy all day long, it is difficult to remember the exact number of people who come every day. However, people remember that the number of people who regularly come is at least about ten.

    In the past, the reception of guests was handled by the cooperative assigning rooms and meals in the homes of cooperative members. Later, the cooperative cadres felt that this was not a long-term solution, so they came up with an expedient solution, clearing out the two large rooms where the feeders lived and temporarily using them as a small guest house for the guests. In addition, a small canteen was set up, with the cooperative's deputy director and a production team leader serving as full-time cooks, and the cooperative recording work points for them according to the number of workdays. For a production cooperative that was established through diligence and thrift, this was indeed not a small burden. But this is not the main problem.

    It can be seen that these people who came were all ordered to focus on "key projects." They all wanted to do more good things for the Jianming Production Cooperative, and they all wanted to learn good experiences from here and collect more moving materials. These comrades are also not to be blamed. They are all actively responsible and eager to complete the tasks assigned to them by their superiors. However, the crux of the problem lies here.

    Because the cooperative is small, production is busy, there are many visitors, and there are many things to do, the work is bound to be much more burdensome, and conflicts are likely to occur. Sometimes, the work (meeting) schedule has to be arranged more than half a month later. Needless to say, the working objects of these "comrades" are first of all the cooperative cadres, and secondly some or all of the cooperative members. Otherwise, how can they complete their tasks? For example, when the Land Planning Group was here, they had to absorb as many as twenty, or as few as four or five, cooperative cadres and experienced old farmers to participate in their work every day; at noon, cooperative members had to learn technology, learn culture, or hold some meetings; in the evening, meetings were of course indispensable, the most fixed being the discussion of Articles 4 and 5 of the "National Agricultural Development Program"; in addition, they had to look at pictures, learn to dance, and accept interviews, etc. As everyone knows, in addition to this, the cooperative itself has a lot of work to do, a lot of meetings to hold, and the cooperative members themselves cannot be without a little housework. More importantly, the cooperative members are busy with production. After the sum of all these things is added to the cooperative cadres and members, they have to get up before dawn and go to sleep in the middle of the night, and they cannot rest at noon. How much energy can people have? Cooperative members reflected: "The cadres of government agencies can work in shifts, but we can't be idle, we are too sleepy!" Cooperative cadres are of course even busier. I personally saw Comrade Tong Chun, the township secretary, with his eyes red from exhaustion, wiping tears and persevering in his work. I really admire Comrade Wang Guofan, the director of the cooperative, for his abundant energy. Even so busy, he still squeezed out a short amount of time to go to the fields to produce.

    Does so many people filling up a cooperative affect their production? I think there is no need to answer this question. But one more fact should be mentioned here: since the beginning of summer, the Jianming Production Cooperative has had several hundred acres of land uncultivated, and a large area of peanut fields north of Xishilipu Village has grass taller than the seedlings. Although excessive rain is an important reason, the cooperative members' dispersed energy and fatigue cannot but be a direct cause.

    Comrade Wang Guofan, the director of the cooperative, said meaningfully: "The 'comrades' here are no less than those in Geng Changsuo's cooperative!" It can be seen that this situation is not unique to the Jianming Production Cooperative.

    I want to appeal for the Jianming Production Cooperative and those famous agricultural cooperatives that have the same fate: please the various government agencies to decentralize the "key projects," "popularize" the work more, reduce their burden, let these "key projects" be freed from the heavy burden, and let them produce well!

### “重点”的重压

    “重点”的重压
    燕农
    看过“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书和常看人民日报的人，都会知道河北省遵化县有一个以“勤俭办社”著名的建明农林牧生产合作社。建明生产合作社名扬于世以后，在这个社里就出现了一个畸形的“高潮”——“同志们”（社员们都这样称呼从各机关来的工作人员）不断地从四面八方涌向建明生产合作社所在的西四十里铺村。在这个仅有一百几十户人家的小小山村的高低不平的街道上，人来车往，真是一番从未有过的“新气象。”
    就拿今年五月十五日这一天来说，据驻乡指导员李继增同志统计，在这个社吃饭的客人一共是四十九名。按我不完全的记忆，这里边有搞土地规划的农业部土地规划组的十四人（他们前后在这里工作了二十天），随同他们学习的遵化报社工作人员一人；某电影制片厂的摄影师刚走，一位体验生活的作家留了下来；中国青年报有一位记者在这里采访；县委书记陈青山同志，带通信员一人，住在这里深入下层；县教育科扫盲办公室的一个干部是来组织扫盲的，并有区民校总校长协助；县团委陈书记等三人，和区农业技术站的五个人，正在合力组织农业技术学校；县公安局也有三个人住在这里，他们是专门试行“全国农业发展纲要”的第四第五两条的；还有水利科的两位同志，在负责指导修建水渠；县卫生院和区卫生工作者协会的三个人，也在这里推行新接生法和举行卫生图片展览；区卫生工作者协会的另外两个人，正在研究设立诊所的问题；此外，还有县文化馆的两个人，一个人在帮助搞俱乐部，一个人专门传授民间舞蹈；还有……；恕我记不清楚了。
    四十九个人，可能是这一时期人数最多的了。因为这个社还没有建立来往客人登记制度，加上社干部和社员们终日忙乱，很难记清每天来人的确实数目。不过，人们记得，经常的人数最少也在十个左右。
    以前，对于客人的接待，都是由社里在社员家里派房派饭。后来，社干部感到这不是长久之计，于是想出了一个权宜的办法，把饲养员住的两间大房子腾了出来，暂做客人们的小型招待所。另外，成立了一个小食堂，抽出社里的副主任和一个生产队长任专职炊事员，由社里按劳动日给他们记工分。对于一个克勤克俭办起来的生产合作社来说，这确实是不算小的负担。但是，这还不是主要的。
    可以看得出，来的这些人，都是受命来抓“重点”的。他们都想给建明生产合作社多做点好事，都想从这里汲取一些好经验，多收集一些动人的材料。对这些同志，也是无可非难的。他们都是积极负责、争先恐后地来完成上级交付给他们的任务。然而，问题的关键也就在这里。
    由于社小、生产忙、来人多、事情多，工作必然要繁重的多，也易于发生冲突。有时候，工作（会议）日程不得不安排到半个月以后。用不着说明，这些“同志们”的工作对象，首先是社干部，其次是部分或全体社员。不然，他们怎能完成任务呢？比如：土地规划组在这里的时候，每天都要吸收多到二十个，少则四、五个社干部和有经验的老农参加他们的工作；中午，社员们要学技术、学文化或者开什么会议；晚上，会当然更少不了，比较固定的是讨论“全国农业发展纲要”中的四、五两条；此外，还要看图片、学跳舞，以及接受访问等等。大家知道，除此之外，合作社本身还有很多工作要做，好多会要开，社员自己也不能没有一点家务事。更重要的是，社员们正在忙于生产。所有这些事情的总和，加在社干部和社员身上以后，他们不得不天不亮起床，半夜才能睡觉，中午也不能休息。人的精力能有多大呢？社员们反映：“机关干部可以轮班干，我们可是不得闲，太困哪！”社干部当然更忙了。我亲眼看到乡秘书佟春同志两只眼睛熬得红红的，擦着泪在坚持工作。我真佩服社主任王国藩同志充沛的精力，就这样忙，他还是挤出短暂的时间下地生产。
    这样多的人充塞在一个社里，是不是影响他们的生产呢？我想这个问题是用不着再解答了。但还有一点事实应该在这里提到：入夏以来，建明生产合作社有几百亩地荒了，西四十里铺村北一大片花生地，草比苗还高。雨多固然是重要原因，社员精力分散、疲劳，不能不说是直接原因。
    社主任王国藩同志曾经意味深长地说：“我们这里的‘同志们’，比起在耿长锁那个社的，也不能算少！”可见这种情况，并不光是建明生产合作社有。
    我要为建明生产合作社以及和它们有相同命运的那些出名的农业社呼吁：请各机关把“重点”分散一下，把工作“普及”一些，减轻它们的负担，让这些“重点”从重压下解脱出来，让他们好好地生产吧！
