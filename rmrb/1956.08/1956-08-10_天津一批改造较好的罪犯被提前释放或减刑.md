Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 8th: The Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court, upon the request of the Public Security Bureau's labor reform department and after review, has legally ruled to grant early release, parole, and reduced sentences to a batch of criminals who have demonstrated genuine repentance during their labor reform.

The criminals who received leniency this time all showed genuine remorse and performed meritorious service during their labor reform. For example, the tyrant and traitor Gao Bohai consistently oppressed the masses during the period of the Japanese puppet regime and once presented the wealth he had extorted from the people as a tribute to ingratiate himself with Japanese imperialism. Over the past few years, through labor reform, he gradually recognized the evils of his past, actively participated in labor, and provided the government with a great deal of information for reporting crimes. Therefore, he was granted a four-year reduction in his sentence this time.

Wu Honglin, who was granted early release, was originally a Kuomintang secret agent sentenced to ten years in prison. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he organized a puppet trade union in the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, sowing discord among workers and undermining the workers' movement. After liberation, he destroyed reactionary documents and continued to spread rumors. During his labor reform, he recognized the seriousness of his crimes, actively participated in labor, and diligently cared for and maintained machinery. Upon hearing the news of his release four years and eight months early, he was extremely grateful for the government's leniency. He expressed his determination to truly become a useful citizen and strive for the construction of the motherland.

    天津一批改造较好的罪犯被提前释放或减刑
    据新华社天津8日电　天津市高级人民法院根据公安局劳动改造部门的提请，经过审查，依法分别对一批在劳动改造期间确有改悔表现的罪犯作出了提前释放、假释和减刑的裁定。
    这次获得宽大处理的罪犯都是在劳动改造期间确有悔罪立功表现的。如恶霸、汉奸高渤海，在日伪时期一贯欺压群众，曾经以搜刮来的民财献金讨好日本帝国主义。几年来，他经过劳动改造，逐步认清了过去的罪恶，积极劳动，并向政府提供了许多检举材料。因此，他这次受到减刑四年的宽大处理。
    获得提前释放的吴鸿林，原来是被判处十年徒刑的中统特务。在国民党反动统治时期，他在天津自行车厂组织伪工会，挑拨工人关系，破坏工人运动。解放后又销毁反动证件，继续散布谣言。在劳动改造期间，他认识到自己罪恶的严重性，积极劳动，认真爱护和保养机器。当他听到被提前四年八个月开释的消息后，异常感激政府的宽大处理，他表示要真正做一个有用的公民，为祖国的建设事业努力。
