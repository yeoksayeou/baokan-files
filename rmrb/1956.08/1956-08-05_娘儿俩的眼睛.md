In the Tuanjie (Unity) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shili Pu, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, there lived a blind Hui woman named Wang Haizhe, who was forty years old. Wang D娘 also had a beloved daughter named Ma Cui, who became blind four years ago due to an eye disease. For several years, although both mother and daughter had eyes, neither could see the other, which was very painful.

After the high tide of agricultural cooperativization arrived, Wang D娘 felt endless joy in her heart, but she also had a concern: she could not open her eyes and participate in labor alongside her husband, Wang Sanhe. Because of this, Wang D娘 had once said to Wang Sanhe: "Sanhe! It's so good that our family has joined the cooperative! But my eyes still can't see, and I can't work!"

Wang Sanhe fully understood Wang D娘's thoughts; however, because the family had few laborers and not much income, there was no spare money to treat her eyes. Therefore, he could only comfort her: "We'll find a way to treat them later!"

One day, two days, one month, two months passed quickly.

In January of this year, after the National Agricultural Development Program was promulgated, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Pingliang enthusiastically supported the agricultural cooperativization movement in various ways. A hygiene company of a certain unit also began to assist agricultural production cooperatives in preventing and treating diseases.

In early May, Wang Xiufang from the Tuanjie Cooperative, along with her children, returned from seeing a doctor with the People's Liberation Army and happened to meet Wang D娘. Wang Xiufang greeted her from afar: "Haizhe, the People's Liberation Army doctors can treat eye diseases, you should go and see them!"

"Does it cost money?" Wang D娘 asked with a smile.

"No money!"

The next day, Wang D娘 took a letter of introduction from the township government and happily walked towards the hygiene company of a certain unit. As she walked, she thought, "I've lived for forty years, and I've never heard of seeing a doctor without paying."

When she arrived at the hygiene company, Wang D娘 took out the letter of introduction from the township government and also asked, "Comrades, do you charge money for treating eye diseases here?..." Before she could finish asking, a nurse comrade in a clean white uniform answered her kindly, "No money."

The hygiene company's doctor carefully examined Wang D娘's eyes and said to her, "In another six months, your eyes will be difficult to treat." Wang D娘 couldn't help but shudder. That day, the doctor performed surgery on her.

The news of the People's Liberation Army treating Wang D娘's eyes quickly spread to her daughter, Ma Cui. The next morning, Ma Cui went with her mother to see the People's Liberation Army. To enable the young Ma Cui to regain her sight in the short term, the doctor, based on the condition of Ma Cui's eyes, even made an artificial pupil for one of her eyes.

Under the careful treatment of the doctors and nurses, a month later, the eyes of both Wang D娘 and her daughter gradually brightened. Being able to see the light after being blind for several years overjoyed them. When Ma Cui was able to see people for the first time, she ran to her mother's house in leaps and bounds, and before even seeing her mother's face, she shouted: "Mother, I can see you!" When Wang D娘 saw her beloved daughter's face, she was equally excited and speechless.

    娘儿俩的眼睛
    于泉　陈赞超
    甘肃省平凉市十里铺的团结农业生产合作社里有一个四十岁的瞎眼的回族老大娘，她的名字叫王海哲。王大娘还有一个心爱的女儿叫马翠，四年前得了眼病，眼睛也瞎了。几年来，娘儿俩虽然都有眼睛，但是谁也不能看谁一眼，这多痛苦。
    农业合作化高潮到来以后，王大娘心里有说不完的快乐，但也有一件心事：自己不能睁开眼睛和丈夫王三合一道参加劳动、为了这，王大娘曾经向王三合提过：“三合呀！咱家参加了合作社，多好啊！可是就是我的眼还看不见东西，不能劳动！”
    王三合完全理解王大娘的心思；但，因为家里劳动力少，收入不多，没有余钱给她治眼。因此，他只能安慰她：“以后有法子再治吧！”
    一天，两天，一月，两月很快地过去。
    今年一月，全国农业发展纲要颁布以后，驻平凉的解放军热情地从各方面来支援农业合作化运动。某部的一个卫生连也开始了帮助农业生产合作社进行防御、治疗疾病的工作。
    五月初，团结合作社里的王秀芳和自己的孩子，从解放军那里看病回来，刚好碰上了王大娘。王秀芳很远就招呼她：“海哲，解放军的医生会治眼病，你去看看吧！”
    “要钱吗？”王大娘满脸笑容的问道。
    “不要钱！”
    第二天，王大娘取了乡政府的介绍信，兴高采烈地向某部卫生连走去。她一边走着，一边想着：“我活了四十来岁，从来没听说看病不要钱的事。”
    到了卫生连，王大娘掏出了乡政府的介绍信，还问道：“同志，你们这里看眼病要钱吗？……”还没有等她问完，一个穿着洁白工作服的护士同志和蔼地回答了她：“不要钱。”
    卫生连的医生给王大娘仔细地检查了眼睛，对她说：“再过半年，你的眼睛就不好治了。”王大娘不禁打了个“寒颤”。这天，医生就给她施行了手术。
    解放军给王大娘治眼的消息，很快地传到了她的女儿马翠那里。第二天清早，马翠便找她娘一齐去解放军那里看眼。医生为使年轻的马翠能够在短期内重见光明，根据马翠眼病的情况，有一只眼睛还作了人造瞳孔。
    在医生同志、护士同志的认真治疗下，一个月以后，王大娘和她女儿的眼睛都逐渐亮起来。瞎了几年的眼睛，今天能够见到光明，这可把她娘俩乐坏了。当马翠第一次能看见人的时候，便三步并成两步的跑到娘家，还没有见到她娘的脸就喊开：娘，我能看到你了！当王大娘一见到自己心爱的女儿的脸时，心里同样激动的说不出话来。
