Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th: The Shanghai local heavy industry authorities are starting to strengthen technical management and carry out technical transformations in order to change the current situation of unstable product quality. Most of Shanghai's local mechanical and electrical factories started as repair shops, and their technical personnel and veteran workers possess superb imitation skills. In the past seven years, the factories under the Shanghai Municipal First and Second Heavy Industry Bureaus have added an average of 1,300 new products each year. New products account for 60% of the more than 18,600 products produced in the past seven years. However, most factories still rely mainly on the skills of experienced craftsmen, lacking reliable blueprints, complete technical data, and process regulations, and failing to establish formal technical management systems. At the same time, many factories lack precision machines and instruments. Therefore, the quality of new and old products is unstable. The competent authorities inspected more than 500 major products in the second quarter of this year and found that about 57.8% had good quality and improved, 15.7% had poor or declining quality, and 26.5% had neither declined nor improved.

Many important new products often have to be reworked and repaired when they are mass-produced, resulting in significant losses. For example, the joint state-private Hengxin Machine Factory imitated eight new Czechoslovakian milling machines. Before they were even appraised, they invested in materials for 39 machines in the first half of this year. When problems were discovered during the appraisal in the second quarter, 32 machines had already essentially completed parts processing, and all had to be reworked. Another joint state-private Qiujing Machine Factory accepted the task of manufacturing 50 eight-foot heavy-duty lathes. Before the first one was successfully trial-produced, they invested in materials for 30 machines. Recently, it was discovered that there were many errors in the blueprints, and all had to be reworked.

Now, the local heavy industry authorities and specialized companies have begun to strengthen the leadership of new product trial production, requiring affiliated factories to earnestly prepare for production and strictly follow trial production specifications. When a group of factories trial-produced and produced new products such as Soviet-standard switches and automotive electrical appliances in the first half of this year, they strictly followed Soviet technical data and process regulations, resulting in good quality.

For old products that continue to be mass-produced, the competent authorities have begun to prioritize them, starting with products with major quality problems, conducting technical training, i.e., appraising them one by one, reviewing and revising blueprints, and formulating quality standards, inspection specifications, and process regulations. The technical training for all major old products will be completed in one and a half to two years.

The government has decided to allocate a batch of funds to carry out necessary technical transformations in Shanghai's local heavy industry factories. The first priority is to add key equipment, precision machines, and inspection and testing instruments according to production needs and possibilities, while also upgrading some old machines. The First Heavy Industry Bureau has added an investment of 3.5 million yuan to the budget items for technical organizational measures this year in order to add precision machines and instruments and upgrade old machines for its affiliated factories. The investment in adding key equipment for affiliated factories this year is also around 10 million yuan.

    从加强技术管理和技术改造入手
    上海地方重工业积极改善产品质量
    新华社上海13日电　上海地方重工业主管部门正在着手加强技术管理和进行技术改造，以求改变目前产品质量不稳定的局面。绝大部分是修配起家的上海地方机电工厂，技术人员和老工人具有高超的仿造技能。在过去七年中，上海市第一、第二重工业局所属的工厂，平均每年增加一千三百种新产品，新产品占七年来先后生产的一万八千六百多种产品的60％。但是大部分工厂到目前为止，主要地还是靠老师傅的手艺吃饭，没有可靠的图纸、完整的技术资料和工艺规程，没有建立正规的技术管理制度；同时，很多厂都缺乏精密的机器和仪器。因此，新老产品的质量不稳定。主管部门在今年第二季度检查了五百多种主要产品，发现其中质量较好并且有进步的约占57.8％，质量差或下降的占15.7％；没有下降也没有进步的有26.5％。
    有不少重要的新产品在成批生产的时候，往往都要返工修配，损失很大。如公私合营恒新机器厂仿造了八台捷克斯洛伐克新型铣床，还没有进行鉴定就在今年上半年投料三十九台，当第二季度鉴定发现有毛病的时候，已经有三十二台基本上结束了零件加工，结果都要进行返修。另一家公私合营求精机器厂接受了五十台八呎重型车床的制造任务，第一台还未试制成功就投料三十台，最近发现图纸错误很多，全部要返工。
    现在，地方重工业主管局和专业公司已经开始加强新产品试制工作的领导，要求所属厂认真做好生产准备工作并且要严格按试制规格办事。今年上半年一批厂在试制和生产苏联规格的开关和汽车电器等新产品的时候，严格按照苏联的技术资料和工艺规程进行生产，质量较好。
    对继续成批生产的老产品，主管局已经开始进行排队，先将其中质量问题较大的产品，进行技术补课，即逐一进行鉴定，审查和修订图纸，制定质量标准、检验规范及工艺规程。全部主要的老产品的技术补课工作，以一年半到两年的时间完成。
    政府已经决定拨出一批资金对上海地方重工业工厂进行必要的技术改造，首先是根据生产的需要和可能，添置关键性的设备、精密机器和检验、试验仪器，同时改装一部分旧机器。第一重工业局为了给所属厂添置精密机器、仪器和改装旧机器，今年在技术组织措施的预算项目当中，又追加了三百五十万元的投资；今年为所属厂添置关键性设备的投资，也在一千万元左右。
