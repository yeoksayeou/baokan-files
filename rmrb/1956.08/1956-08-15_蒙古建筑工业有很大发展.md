Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, August 13th: According to a report in the Mongolian "News," the construction industry in Mongolia has greatly developed. Investment in the construction industry has increased twenty-five and a half times in the past twelve years. In the last three years alone, the number of construction workers has increased by more than two and three-tenths.

In 1940, Mongolia had only one brick factory and one lime factory, and these two factories could only produce in the summer. However, in the past fifteen years, the production of building materials has greatly increased. A series of brick factories and dozens of other enterprises using local materials to produce various building materials have been built, and the production of metal sheets and concrete panels has been arranged.

Mechanization has been widely adopted on construction sites, with a large proportion of mortar mixing and concrete operations now mechanized. 60% of earthwork and 70% of hoisting operations are also mechanized.

    蒙古建筑工业有很大发展
    据新华社13日讯　乌兰巴托消息：据蒙古“消息报”报道，蒙古的建筑工业有了很大发展。近十二年来建筑工业方面的投资增加了二十五倍半。仅在近三年中建筑工人人数就增加了二点三倍多。
    在1940年时，蒙古只有一个造砖厂和一个石灰厂，而且这两个工厂只是在夏天才能生产。但是十五年来，建筑材料的生产有了很大增加。建筑了一系列的造砖厂和其他几十个利用本地材料生产各种建筑材料的企业，并且安排了金属板和混凝土板的生产。
    各建筑工地广泛采用了机械化作业，很大部分拌浆和混凝土的作业都已经机械化，60％的土工和70％的起重作业也都机械化了。
