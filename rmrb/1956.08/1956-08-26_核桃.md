    Walnut

    The walnut is an important economic forest tree. Walnuts are widely distributed in China. Fenyang and Xiaoyi counties in Shanxi Province and the western part of Hebei Province are the main producing areas of walnut kernels in our country. The walnuts in these areas are of excellent quality. Fenyang walnut kernels are characterized by large pieces, plump meat, white color, and a sweet aroma.
    Every part of the walnut can be utilized: Walnut wood is very strong and has a luster. It is not only an important material for military equipment but also a raw material for making high-quality furniture. The bark and leaves of the walnut tree and the green peel of the walnut are used as dyes to dye fabrics and wood brown and black. Walnut shells can also be used to make activated carbon. Walnut kernels are rich in fat, protein, and vitamins. The kernels can be pressed for oil or eaten as dried fruit. Walnut kernels are also a medicinal material. Traditional Chinese medicine often uses them to treat anemia, gastrointestinal diseases, and gynecological diseases.
    Walnut kernels are an important export commodity of our country. Every year, our country exports thousands of tons of walnut kernels to European countries and Southeast Asia. The economic value of walnut kernels is very high. Each ton of walnut kernels can be exchanged for six tons of steel.
    Although walnuts have so many advantages, they also have a major disadvantage: they bloom and bear fruit very late, generally starting to bear fruit ten to fifteen years after planting. Therefore, farmers in some areas say, "Plant peach trees for three years, apricot trees for four years, pear trees for five years, but don't plant a walnut orchard if you don't have a son." In fact, this is not entirely true. If grafting methods are used or early-fruiting varieties are selected, walnuts can bear fruit earlier.
    Farmers in Licheng County, Shandong Province, use two- or three-year-old *Fraxinus chinensis* (locally known as Pingliu) as rootstock. Walnuts grafted onto them will bear fruit within three or four years after they survive. Including the time for cultivating the rootstock, it takes only five or six years. Walnuts grafted using *Fraxinus chinensis* not only bear fruit earlier but also have the advantages of reducing seedling costs, avoiding variation from seed propagation, and fixing the excellent characteristics of the parent plant.
    In the third district and fourth township of Fufeng County, Shaanxi, there is an early-fruiting walnut variety. This type of walnut generally begins to bear fruit in the third year after sowing. Local farmers call it "Alternate-year Walnut." The same walnut variety has also been found in Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
    The "Alternate-year Walnut" grows rapidly. The seedlings are about one and a half feet tall in the second year after sowing, and a few plants can bear two to four fruits. In the third year, they can generally bear five to six fruits. Four-year-old saplings reach about six feet. A tree of this type of walnut can yield more than 1,000 fruits during its peak fruiting period, and it can bear fruit every year. The "Alternate-year Walnut" has a thin seed coat, plump kernel, and high oil content (preliminary analysis shows 60%-70%). The entire kernel is easy to remove, has a slight astringent taste, and has a fragrant flavor when eaten raw, similar to the famous thin-shelled walnut of Hebei Province.
    Many agricultural production leadership departments and agricultural scientific research departments attach great importance to this walnut variety. The Northwest Agricultural Science Institute began trial planting in Bin County, Shaanxi, in 1953. In 1955, after the Ministry of Agriculture learned about this situation, it immediately notified the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute to promote and continue research on the spot. In the autumn of 1955, the Ministry of Agriculture also sent some seeds of "Alternate-year Walnut" to relevant experimental research departments in Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Hebei, and other provinces for trial planting. The Bayi Victory Farm also planted nearly 900 mu of this type of walnut. (Attached picture)

    核桃

    核桃是一种重要的经济林木。核桃在我国分布很广，山西省的汾阳、孝义等县和河北省西部一带是我国核桃仁的主要产区。这些地区的核桃品质极好。汾阳核桃仁，具有片大、肉肥、色白、香甜等特点。
    核桃的每一部分都能利用：核桃的木材非常坚韧，有光泽，不但是重要的军械用材，而且是作高贵家具的原料。核桃树的皮、叶子和核桃的绿色果皮用作染料，可以把布匹和木材染成褐色和黑色。核桃果壳还可以制活性炭。核桃的果仁富有脂肪、蛋白质和维生素。果仁可以榨油，也可以作为干果食用。核桃仁也是一种药材，中医常用它治疗贫血、肠胃病和妇女病等。
    核桃仁是我国重要出口物资的一种。每年我国要输出核桃仁数千吨到欧洲各国和南洋等地。核桃仁的经济价值很高，每吨核桃仁可以换回六吨钢材。
    核桃虽然具有这样多的优点，但是也有一个很大的缺点，就是开花结果很晚，一般在种植后十年到十五年才开始结果。所以有些地区的农民这样说：“桃三杏四梨五年，无儿不种核桃园”。其实，不完全是这样，如果用嫁接的办法或选用早结果的品种，核桃是可以提早结果的。
    山东省历城县的农民选用二、三年生的枫杨（当地称为坪柳）作砧木，嫁接的核桃成活以后，三、四年内就能结果，连培养砧木的时间在内，也不过五、六年。利用枫杨嫁接的核桃，不但结果提早，而且具有能降低育苗成本、避免实生变异、固定母株的优良特性。
    陕西扶风县三区四乡有一种提早结果的核桃品种。这种核桃播种以后，一般能在第三年开始结果。当地农民称它为“隔年核桃”。新疆维吾尔自治区的阿克苏地区，也发现有同样的核桃品种。
    “隔年核桃”生长迅速，播种后第二年的幼苗约有一尺五寸高，少数的植株可以结两个到四个果，第三年一般可以结五—六个果。四年生的幼树即达六尺左右。这种核桃的盛果期，一株可采果一千多个，而且年年可以结果。“隔年核桃”的种皮较薄，种仁饱满，油分很多（据初步分析为60％—70％），整仁易脱，涩味小，生食时富有香味，类似河北省著名的薄壳核桃。
    许多农业生产领导部门和农业科学研究部门都很重视这个核桃品种。西北农业科学研究所由1953年起就开始在陕西邠县试种。1955年农业部知道这个情况以后，立即通知陕西省农业厅和西北农业科学研究所就地推广和继续研究。农业部在1955年秋季，还把一些“隔年核桃”的种子，分别寄给了山东、山西、辽宁、河北等省的有关试验研究部门试种。八一胜利农场也播种了近九百亩这种核桃。（附图片）
