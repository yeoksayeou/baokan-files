    Aerial Forest Protection
    ·Zhi Jian·
    Every year, right at the turn of spring, the aircraft of the Civil Aviation Forest Protection Team, like a flock of sensitive migratory birds, arrive on time over the Xing'anling forest area. When the people in the forest area hear the sound of the planes, they know that spring has arrived.
    Aerial forest protection work began in 1952, and the scale has expanded year by year. This spring, according to the forest protection plan of the Ministry of Forestry, the Civil Aviation Administration dispatched a total of nine aircraft to undertake forest fire prevention tasks in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia areas. Forest fire alarms have been frequent this year, and the fires have been unusually fierce; if they are detected late, a major fire would cause irreparable losses to the country. In order to protect the country's forest treasures, from April to June, above the sky-high primitive forest area, there were constantly civil aviation forest protection aircraft carrying observers from the Ministry of Forestry, patrolling at low altitude, discovering more than one hundred fire situations.
    When the ground firefighting team received the fire report dropped from the plane, they rushed to the fire area day and night to rescue it. Sometimes, they lost their way in the deep mountains and ancient forests, but as long as they sent a signal for directions, the plane would quickly scatter soybean particles to guide them on a correct path. Sometimes, the firefighters ran out of rations, and thousands of firefighters were trapped in remote mountains and wilderness without outside support, but the transport planes of the Civil Aviation Forest Protection Team had already transported a large amount of food and daily necessities from hundreds of miles away and airdropped them to support them. When fighting against forest fires, the high-altitude aircraft are also shrewd commanders who know the enemy and themselves. It accurately directs the firefighters to encircle, intercept, block fire paths, and prevent the spread of the fire at any time according to the changes in the fire situation. It is this tense and arduous common battle life that closely connects the hearts of the people in the forest area with this group of mountain eagles with iron wings—the Civil Aviation Forest Protection aircraft.
    During the nearly three-month spring forest protection period this year, the aircraft of the Civil Aviation Forest Protection Team flew a total of 1,468 hours, completing 183.5% of the original plan, an increase of 146.9% compared with the same period last year. The total area of the forest area under the vigilance of the forest protection aircraft is nearly eight million square kilometers. More than 40,000 kilograms of grain have been airdropped in various times, enough for three thousand people to eat for a month. In addition, the forest protection aircraft also dropped 175,000 copies of leaflets on forest protection and fire prevention to the vast forest area residents.
    Now, the rainy season in the forest area has begun. The Civil Aviation Forest Protection Team, with the feeling of victoriously ending the battle, temporarily bid farewell to the green Xing'anling.

    航空护林
    ·志坚·
    每年，正当交春的时节，民用航空护林队的飞机就像一群敏感的侯鸟，准时来到兴安岭林区上空。林区的人们一听见飞机的声响，就知道已经是春天了。
    航空护林工作是从1952年开始的，规模逐年扩大。今年春季，根据林业部护林计划的要求，民用航空局一共派出了九架飞机，在东北和内蒙古一带担负护林防火任务。今年森林火警频繁，火势也异常凶猛；要是发觉晚了，一场大火下来，给国家造成的损失是无法弥补的。为了保护祖国的森林宝藏，从四月到六月，在接地连天的原始林区上空，经日不断地有载着林业部观测员的民用航空护林机群在低飞巡回，前后发现一百多起火情。
    地面的灭火队接到飞机上投下的火情报告，便昼夜兼程赶往火区抢救。有时，他们在深山古林里迷失了方向，但是只要发出问路信号，飞机就会赶紧撒下黄豆粒子，给他们指引一条正确的路径。有时，灭火队随带的口粮吃光了，成千上万的救火人员被困在不通外援的荒山僻野，但是民用航空护林队的运输机早已从几百里以外的地方运来了大批粮食和日用物品，空投下去支援他们。在向森林大火展开搏斗的时候，居高临下的飞机又是知己知彼的精明的指挥员。它随时根据火情的变化，准确地指挥救火人员围堵拦截，封锁火路，阻止火势蔓延。正是这紧张艰苦的共同的战斗生活，把林区人们的心，同这一群长着铁翅膀的山鹰——民用航空护林飞机紧紧地连在一起。
    在今年将近三个月的春季护林期中，民用航空护林队的飞机总共飞行了一千四百六十八个小时，完成了原计划的183.5％，比去年同时期的飞行量增加了146.9％。在护林飞机警戒下的林区，总面积近八百万平方公里。历次空投的粮食有四万多公斤，足够三千个人吃一个月。此外，护林飞机还向广大的林区居民投掷了十七万五千份关于护林防火的传单。
    现在，林区的雨季已经开始。民用航空护林队怀着胜利结束战斗的心情，暂时告别了绿色的兴安岭。
