    Lhasa Impressions (Part 1)
    Lin Gang
    City of Sunlight
    The sky in Lhasa is a transparent blue. The sunlight makes the golden roofs of the lamaseries glitter. In this city, the sun shines every day of the year. "Old Lhasa residents" tell us that during the rainy season, there are often torrential downpours at night, but the days are clear again. Therefore, the Tibetans proudly call Lhasa the "City of Sunlight." The climate here is very good. It is said that even in the height of summer, it is not oppressively hot, with the highest temperature not exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. In the coldest winter months, the river does not freeze, and there is no need for stoves indoors. Lung disease is rarely heard of on the Tibetan plateau. If it weren't for the slightly high altitude (Lhasa is nearly 3,700 meters above sea level, which is not easy for newcomers to adapt to), this would indeed be an ideal sanatorium.
    The Lhasa River flows quietly by the city, the water clear and shallow, so that the pebbles on the riverbed are visible. On the river beach, Tibetan girls washing clothes sing happy songs, laughter intermingled with the singing. The Linkas along the riverbank are covered in a vibrant green, making this beautiful city even younger and more charming. The Tibetan word "Linka" means garden, but it is different from the parks and gardens of the inland. There are more trees and fewer flowers, and no special facilities for sightseeing. But the Linkas of Lhasa are truly a delight to the eye. On holidays, many colorful tents are set up in the open spaces in the woods, and Tibetan and Han men and women, carrying highland barley wine, and bringing stringed instruments, flutes, and accordions, dance, sing, picnic, and play games together. Some nobles have built houses in privately owned Linkas as summer villas. Norbulingka is the Dalai Lama's summer palace. The Dalai Lama moves from the Potala Palace to Norbulingka on a fixed day, and a ceremony is held. From that day on, Lhasa officially changes seasons. Citizens change into summer clothes, and the "Shualinka" (enjoying the Linka) season follows.
    Wandering through the streets of Lhasa, we are constantly attracted by the unfamiliar yet familiar Tibetan customs. The urban area is not large. The streets are short, and there are many narrow alleys. The houses are all stone-built, generally two or three stories high, with trapezoidal flat roofs. The upper ends of the doors and windows have brackets as eaves. The people of Lhasa love flowers and trees, and almost every window with silk curtains is decorated with flower pots. The walls are plastered with white chalk powder, and the streets and alleys are all white, giving a feeling of tranquility and comfort. Ropes are stretched across the roofs of every household, and colorful prayer flags are hung. On the evening of my arrival in Lhasa, I climbed onto the rooftop platform and saw the whole city covered in colorful flags, and I thought it was some kind of festival.
    At street corners, People's Police and Tibetan soldiers jointly maintain order. The streets are crowded with people. Whether male or female, old or young, they all walk at a leisurely pace. I don't know if it's because the air is thin on the plateau, and walking fast makes you short of breath. Tibetan women love to wear brightly colored clothes and ornaments; men all wear braids, some coiled into buns, some trailing behind them, and they all like to wear a short knife on their waist. Lamas wearing maroon kasayas drape their yellow hats over their right shoulders when walking. Officials wear the yellow robes that have been used since the Qing Dynasty. In the past, nobles rode horses, but now most of them drive motorcycles. Herdsmen wear sheepskin coats with their bodies exposed, and follow slowly behind herds of yaks, without any hurry, the yaks carrying hides and butter into the city to sell. Farmers from the suburbs drive mule teams to transport yak dung to the city every day. Lhasa uses dry yak dung as fuel.
    If you walk through the back streets and alleys, you can see leather craftsmen leaning against doors sewing red-topped Tibetan boots, and coppersmiths crafting exquisite Buddha statues. If you come across a mani stone pile (a pile of stones, each stone engraved with scriptures or the six-character mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum"), you must respect the religious customs of the Tibetans and walk around it from the left.
    The Barkhor Street around the Jokhang Temple is the area where shops and stalls are concentrated. Trade companies, People's Bank, and Xinhua Bookstore are also located here. The shops have no signs, and most of the shopkeepers are women. Their generous and magnanimous attitude in business is indeed worth mentioning. When several customers enter at the same time, the shopkeeper takes out the items that each customer wants and lets you choose without supervision. After you have chosen, you go to pay yourself. Therefore, even when customers are crowded on holidays, one female shopkeeper is enough to handle it with ease. The stalls are all covered with a white tarpaulin to block the scorching sun. Most of the stalls sell local products from Tibet: pulu (Tibetan wool fabric), Tibetan carpets, hadas (ceremonial scarves), Buddha statues, wooden bowls, gold-edged floral hats, horse gear, dried yak and mutton, butter... Imperialism once carried out cruel plunder of the Tibetan people through the Lhasa market. Before liberation, the Lhasa market sold goods from all over the world, from Hollywood cosmetics and foreign noodles to all kinds of high-end and valuable items. Now the nature of the market is changing. Trade companies purchase wool from herdsmen at fair and reasonable prices, and the People's Bank provides free loans to support agricultural production. More than a thousand kinds of new domestic goods transported from the interior have appeared in the Lhasa market. Tibetan compatriots love Hangzhou silk, Shanghai daily necessities, Yunnan brick tea, and Jiangxi porcelain. The first batch of consignment shops with socialist characteristics have appeared on the streets.
     The Holy Land of Lamaism
    Ancient, magnificent temple buildings are all over the city. I once followed the central delegation to Zhebang Temple, one of the three major temples, to distribute alms. This famous temple has more than 7,000 lamas. Thousands of Buddha halls and houses, overlapping and covering half of the hillside, resemble a town. Of Lhasa's population of about 50,000, one-third are lamas.
    The Potala Palace is the pride of the Tibetan people and enriches the cultural heritage of the motherland. Whether in the bright sunlight or under the stars; viewed from the front or from the side; whether standing in front of it to admire it, or looking at it from a distance, the Potala Palace is always majestic and beautiful.
    In front of the Jokhang Temple, Tibetans prostrate themselves in worship from morning till night. The blue flagstones in front of the steps have been worn into many smooth, human-shaped deep grooves. The Tibetan word "Lhasa" means holy land. Every year, countless Buddhists travel tens of thousands of miles from Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, India, Nepal, and other places to come here on pilgrimage. Buddhists from near and far come to Lhasa, and before their sweat dries, they first go to the Jokhang Temple to worship Buddha. The Jokhang Temple is the center of the holy land. All religious ceremonies are held here. Every year, starting from the third day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar, Lhasa holds the Great Prayer Festival (called "Monlam Chenmo" in Tibetan). Lamas from the three major temples descend from the mountains and gather with lamas from all over Tibet and Sichuan, Qinghai, and other provinces in the Jokhang Temple to recite scriptures for twenty-one days. At this time, Lhasa is almost a world of lamas. Whenever the sun sets and the Jokhang Temple finishes chanting scriptures, the streets are full of lamas in red robes and yellow hats. The Dalai Lama presides over the scriptures during the Great Prayer Festival. The负责人 (responsible person) of the Tibet Military Region and officials from the Tibetan local government, nobles, and merchants also give alms to the lamas in the temples at this time.
    I have never seen more devout religious believers than the Tibetan people. Almost every family has one or more people who are lamas. Every household has a Buddha hall, and lights yak butter lamps to worship Buddha on festivals. When Tibetans go out, they carry a Buddha box on their chest, believing that this will bring them the protection of Buddha. People do not spend a day without reciting scriptures; some elderly people, except when they open their mouths to speak and eat, also recite scriptures while working and walking.
    Every morning and dusk, you can see groups of Tibetan men and women, shaking prayer wheels or counting prayer beads in their hands, circling Barkhor Street around the Jokhang Temple. This is called "kora". Lamaism has many different ways of chanting scriptures from mainland Buddhism. Scripture towers and mani stone piles can be seen everywhere in streets, narrow alleys, and squares. Tibetans believe that walking around a scripture tower or mani stone pile once in the direction of clockwise rotation is equivalent to reciting the scripture once. The cloisters of the temples have cylindrical prayer drums, which contain scriptures. Worshippers walk past and constantly turn the drums to replace chanting scriptures. The prayer flags on the roof also have this function. The wind blows the flags, which means they are chanting scriptures day and night. In this city, all aspects of people's lives are closely inseparable from religion.
    News reporters from imperialist countries have fabricated so many lies about the Communist Party "eliminating religion" in Tibet over the years. When I arrived in Lhasa, I had the opportunity to see the prosperity of Lamaism with my own eyes and see the Tibetan people freely carrying out all religious activities. I cannot help but sigh for my foreign colleagues.
    I have visited Ganden Tri Rinpoche and Trijang Rinpoche. Ganden Tri Rinpoche is the successor to the throne of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, and is the person with the highest moral character and the deepest understanding of sutras in Tibet. We asked him to talk about how the policy of freedom of religious belief is being implemented in Lhasa.
    Ganden Tri Rinpoche said: "Chairman Mao's religious policy shines on the earth like the sun. Only beasts and underground insects cannot see the blessings that Chairman Mao has brought us." He said: "Not only in Lhasa, but you can see everywhere in Tibet that the temples are in a state of tranquility and peace. No one interferes with our morning and evening recitations. Lamas drink tea, chant scriptures, go to the debate grounds, and hold dharma assemblies, all in accordance with the law. The common people also worship Buddha, chant scriptures, prostrate, give alms, and do all kinds of meritorious deeds as usual."
    This elder, whose beard and hair were already white, sat cross-legged on the mat and talked to us. From time to time, he pressed the small bell beside him. Then a lama came in, picked up the yak butter tea and snacks on the table, invited us to drink, and then poured hot tea again.
    He said that since the Communist Party came, there have been changes in religion: the Gelug sect has become closely united with the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Sakya sects; the People's Liberation Army has built roads, and more people have come to Lhasa to worship Buddha; the Lhasa Great Prayer Festival is more grand and larger every year. This year, there were 5,000 more people than last year, and several more pots of yak butter tea were burned. The income of the temples has not decreased at all. On the contrary, there are more people worshipping Buddha and giving alms, and there is more tsampa and butter, and the lives of the lamas have improved compared to the past.
    Trijang Rinpoche, the deputy tutor of the Dalai Lama, is a figure admired by the Tibetan people. He received us in his sutra hall in the Potala Palace, from where we could hear the constant chanting, clapping, and drumming of the lamas in the Great Sutra Hall.
    "When the People's Liberation Army came to Lhasa, the lamas could do whatever they wanted. The rumors of imperialism can no longer play much of a role now. The Tibetan people have seen the facts. We can now expose these rumors ourselves." Trijang Rinpoche said: "In Tibet, the Han and Tibetan peoples, the lamas and the People's Liberation Army, are truly closely united. What is the reason for this? From the perspective of us who believe in religion, first of all, it is because the People's Liberation Army respects our two Buddhas as much as our Tibetan people."

    拉萨见闻（上）
    林钢
    日光城
    拉萨的天空，蓝得透明。阳光把喇嘛庙的金顶照耀得闪闪发光。在这个城市里，一年四季没有一天不见太阳。“老拉萨”告诉我们，雨季来到以后，常常晚上骤雨如注，白天又是晴朗的天。所以藏民骄傲地把拉萨称为“日光城”。这里的气候很好，据说盛夏来时也并不燠热，最高温度不超过华氏八十五度。冬天最冷的时候，河水不结冰，室内可以不生火炉。在西藏高原上，很少听见有生肺病的。若不是海拔高了一点（拉萨海拔近三千七百公尺，初来的人一时不易适应），这里倒真是一个理想的疗养地。
    拉萨河从市区身边静静地流过，水清又浅，可见河底的鹅卵石。河滩上，洗衣裳的藏族姑娘们，唱着快乐的歌子，歌声里夹杂着笑声。沿着河岸的林卡，披上了一片鲜艳的绿色，使这个美丽的城市显得更加年青而妩媚了，藏语“林卡”，是林园的意思，它跟内地的公园和花园不一样，树木多，花草少，也没有专供游赏的设备。但是拉萨的林卡实在是赏心悦目的好地方。每到假日，林中空地上搭起了许多彩色的帐篷，藏族和汉族的男男女女，背了青稞酒，带了弦子、笛子、手风琴，一起在这儿跳舞、唱歌、野餐、游戏。有些贵族在属于私人所有的林卡里，建造了房屋，作为消夏别墅。罗布林卡是达赖喇嘛的夏宫。达赖喇嘛从布达拉宫移居罗布林卡，有一定的日子，还要举行仪式。从那一天起，拉萨正式换季。市民们都换上了夏装，“耍林卡”的季节，接着也就来到了。
    漫步拉萨街头，我们随时为陌生而又亲切的西藏风习所吸引。市区并不大。街道很短，窄巷很多。房屋都是石砌的，一般是二三层，梯形平顶。门和窗的上端，有斗拱作檐。拉萨人爱花卉树木，挂着绸幔的窗口差不多都有花盆点缀。墙壁外面都泥以白垩粉，大街小巷一片白色，给人一种恬静舒适的感觉。家家户户的屋顶上拉着绳子，挂满五颜六色的经旗。我到拉萨的当天傍晚，登屋顶平台了望，只见全城一片彩旗，还当作是过什么节日呢。
    街道转角处有人民警察和藏军在共同维持秩序。街上来往行人拥挤。无论男的女的，老年人还是小伙子，走起路来都从容不迫。不知道是不是因为高原上空气稀薄，走快了要气喘的缘故。藏族妇女爱穿色彩浓艳的服装，爱戴饰物；男子都留发辫，有的盘成发髻，有的拖在背后，他们都喜欢在腰里佩一柄短刀。披着绛红色裟袈的喇嘛，走路时把黄帽搭在右肩。官员穿的是清代沿用到今天的黄袍。贵族过去是骑马的，现在大多数驾驶摩托车了。牧民光身穿着羊皮袄，一点也不着急地跟在走得很慢的牦牛群后面，牦牛背上驮着进城来卖的皮张、牛油。近郊农民每天赶着骡帮给城市运来牛粪。拉萨是用干牛粪作燃料的。
    你到背街的小巷走走，可以看见皮匠倚门在缝制红统藏靴，铜匠在打造精致的佛像。如果遇见了嘛呢堆（是一堆石头，每一块石头上都刻着经文或“唵嘛呢吧咪吽”的六字真言），你得尊重藏民的宗教习惯，从它的左面绕行。
    围绕大昭寺的八廓街，是商店和摊贩集中的地段。贸易公司、人民银行和新华书店也设在这里。商店都没有招牌，掌柜的多半是妇女。她们经营态度的大方慷慨，确是值得一提。几个顾客同时进去，店主人拿出顾客们各自所要的物品，任凭你挑选，不加监督。挑好以后，你自己去付款。因此，假日顾客再拥挤，一位女掌柜的也足以应付自如。摊贩上面都支着一块白色篷布遮挡炎阳。摊上摆的多半是西藏自产自销的土特产品：氆氇、藏毯、哈达、佛像、木碗、镶金边花帽、马具、干牛羊肉、酥油……。帝国主义曾经通过拉萨市场对西藏人民进行残酷的掠夺。解放以前，拉萨市场上可以看到世界各国的商品，从好莱坞的化妆品、外国挂面、直到各种高级贵重物品。现在市场的性质正在起着变化。贸易公司用公平合理的价格收购牧民的羊毛，人民银行发放无偿贷款来扶持农业生产。已经有一千多种新从内地运来的国货商品出现在拉萨市场，藏胞很喜爱杭州来的绸缎，上海的日用品，云南砖茶，江西瓷器。街上已经出现了第一批带有社会主义性质的代销店。
     喇嘛教的圣地
    古老的金碧辉煌的寺庙建筑，遍布全市。我曾随中央代表团到三大寺之一的哲蚌寺发放布施。这座名寺有七千多喇嘛。佛殿、屋宇数千间，重重叠叠，盖满了半个山坡，俨然一座市镇。拉萨市五万左右人口，其中三分之一是喇嘛。
    布达拉宫是西藏人民的骄傲，它丰富了祖国的文化遗产。无论是在灿烂的太阳光下，还是在星星之夜；从正面看，还是从侧面看；站在它面前瞻仰，还是从远处遥望，布达拉宫永远是雄伟美丽的。
    大昭寺门前，从朝到暮有藏民在顶礼膜拜。阶前的青石板，都磨成了许多光滑的人形深槽。藏语“拉萨”是圣地的意思，每年从青海、四川、甘肃、内蒙古以及印度、尼泊尔等地，万里跋涉来到这里朝圣的佛教徒，不可数计。远近佛教徒来到拉萨，在汗水没有干以前，就先到大昭寺礼佛，大昭寺是圣地的中心。一切宗教盛典都在这里举行。每年藏历正月初三起，拉萨要举行传召法会（藏话叫“莫朗青波”）。三大寺的喇嘛纷纷下山，和来自西藏各地及四川、青海等省的喇嘛，齐集在大昭寺念经二十一天。这时拉萨几乎成了喇嘛的世界，每当夕阳西下大昭寺散经的时候，满街尽是红衣黄帽的喇嘛。达赖喇嘛在传召期间亲临法座讲经。西藏军区负责人和西藏地方政府官员、贵族、商人也在这个时候，向寺院喇嘛放布施。
    我没有见过比藏族人民更虔诚的宗教徒。几乎每家都有一个人或几个人在当喇嘛。家家户户都有佛堂，逢到节日就点燃酥油灯供佛。藏民出门时，胸前带着佛盒，他们相信这样就可以得到佛的护佑。人们没有一天不念经；有些老年人，除了张口说话和饮食以外，劳动、行路的时候也都在念经。
    每天清晨和黄昏，可以看见成群的藏族男女，手里摇着转经筒，或者数着念佛珠，在围绕大昭寺的八廓街上绕行。这叫做“转经”。喇嘛教有好多种不同于内地佛教的念经方式。在街道、窄巷和广场，无处不可以见到经塔和嘛呢堆，藏民认为，顺着时针转动的方向绕经塔或嘛呢堆一周，等于念经一遍。寺庙的回廊上都有圆柱形的转经鼓，里面藏有经卷，朝佛者走过，将鼓不断拨转，以代替念经。屋顶上的经旗，也是这种作用，风吹旗动，就算日夜都在念经。在这个城市里，人民生活的一切方面都是同宗教密切不可分的。
    帝国主义国家的新闻记者，几年来编造了多少关于共产党在西藏“消灭宗教”的谎话。到了拉萨，我有机会亲眼看到了喇嘛教的兴旺，看到藏族人民自由地进行着一切宗教活动，不能不为我的外国同行叹息。
    我曾访问了甘丹赤巴和赤江活佛。甘丹赤巴是黄教创始人宗喀巴法座的继承者，是西藏品德最高、经学造诣最深的人。我们请他谈谈宗教信仰自由政策在拉萨执行得怎么样。
    甘丹赤巴说：“毛主席的宗教政策，像太阳一样普照大地。只有畜生和地下的虫，才看不到毛主席给我们带来的福气。”他说：“不光是在拉萨，你到西藏各地都可以看到，寺庙里一片宁静、和平的景象。没有任何人来干涉我们的朝暮课诵。喇嘛们喝茶、诵经，下辩论场、举行法会，一切都如法如律地进行着。老百姓也照常的朝佛、念经，磕长头，放布施，做种种修功积德的事。”
    这位须发都已经花白的长者，盘膝坐在铺垫上同我们谈话。他不时按动手边的小铃。于是一喇嘛进来，把桌上的酥油茶和点心端起来，请我们饮用，然后又斟上热茶。
    他说，共产党来了以后，宗教方面的变化是有的：黄教同红教、白教、花教各教派之间亲密团结起来了；解放军修了公路，到拉萨来朝佛的人多了；拉萨的传召法会，一年比一年隆重，一年比一年盛大。今年比去年就增加了五千来人，酥油茶也多烧了好几锅。寺院的收入一点也没有减少，相反，朝佛、放布施的人多了，糌粑酥油更充足了，喇嘛的生活比过去有了提高。
    达赖喇嘛的副经师赤江活佛是西藏人民景仰的人物。他在布达拉宫自己的经堂里接见我们，从这里可以听见大经殿上不断传来喇嘛们诵经、击掌和鼓乐之声。
    “解放军到拉萨，喇嘛愿做什么就做什么。帝国主义的谣言现在已经不能起多少作用了。西藏人民看到了事实。我们现在自己可以揭穿这些谣言。”赤江活佛说：“在西藏，汉族和藏族，喇嘛和解放军，是真正亲密团结的。原因在那里呢？从我们信仰宗教的人看来，首先是因为解放军同我们藏族人民一样尊敬我们的两位佛爷。”（附图片）
