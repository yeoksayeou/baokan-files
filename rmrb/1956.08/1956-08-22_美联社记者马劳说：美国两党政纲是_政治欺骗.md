Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, August 21st: AP reporter Marlow commented on the US Democratic and Republican party platforms on the 20th, saying that the platforms of these two parties are "a combination of good intentions and pure political deception."

The reporter pointed out: "You can't find any differences between the two parties' foreign policies. From 1933 to 1953, when the Democratic Party was in power, they put together some basic foreign policies and programs. Four years ago, when the Republicans were elected, they inherited the Democratic Party's entire set of clothes." Marlow said: "You can find endless lies in both parties' foreign policy programs."

He said that the ruling Republican Party does not hesitate to say some "deceptive words" in its platform. For example, the Republicans said that in the current international situation, "international communism" has shown "hesitation." Marlow said, "This is a lie." The fact is that the Soviet Union "has launched an economic offensive" and "their influence in the Middle East is growing. (The United States) cannot find new ways to deal with the Russians." The Republican Party boasts that Austria's independence seems to be due to the Republican government, but in fact, this is only "because the Russians decided to withdraw their troops," and Austria's independence "was not brought about by the Eisenhower government." The Republican Party also boasts of South Vietnam's "freedom and independence," but Marlow pointed out that the Republican Party platform makes no mention of the Vietnamese people and the victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    美联社记者马劳说：
    美国两党政纲是“政治欺骗”
    据新华社21日讯　旧金山消息：美联社记者马劳二十日评论美国民主党和共和党的政纲说：这两个党的政纲“是良好的意图和纯粹的政治欺骗加起来的东西”。
    这位记者指出：“你在两党外交政策中找不到彼此间有什么不同的地方。从1933至1953年民主党当政期间，他们把若干基本的外交政策和纲领放在一起。四年前共和党人当选时，他们承继了民主党的全套衣钵。”马劳说：“两党外交政策纲领中都可以找到连篇假话。”
    他说，在执政的共和党方面，他们在纲领中不惜说一些“骗人的话”。例如，共和党人说，在目前国际局势中，“国际共产主义”已经表现出“踌躇”。马劳说，“这是假话”，事实是：苏联“在经济上采取了攻势”，“他们在中东的影响日益增长。（美国）政府找不出应付俄国人的新办法”。共和党夸耀奥地利取得独立似乎是共和党政府的功劳，但实际上，这只是“因为俄国人决定撤退他们的军队”，奥地利的独立“并不是艾森豪威尔政府促成的”。共和党还夸耀南越的“自由独立”，但是，马劳指出，共和党政纲对越南人民和越南民主共和国的胜利略而不谈。
