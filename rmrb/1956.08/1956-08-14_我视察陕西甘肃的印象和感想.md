My Impressions and Thoughts on Inspecting Shaanxi and Gansu
Chen Chonggui, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Editor's Note: The author, Chen Chonggui, is an elderly pastor in his seventies from the Christian community. In addition to serving as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he is also the Vice-Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church and the President of Chongqing Theological Seminary. This article was written after his inspection of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

In accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, I was able to choose the places I wanted to see, the things I wanted to observe, and conduct the inspection independently. Thus, I went to Shaanxi and Gansu. My method of inspection was to visit local people's courts, public security bureaus, political consultative committees, and democratic women's federations. I also held座谈会 and individual talks with local residents, and visited the prisons in Xi'an and Lanzhou. After returning home, I spent several days recalling, considering, and analyzing the results of the inspection. I wrote about the issues of public security, morality, and education, and I invite people across the nation to provide guidance.

I. Public Security

Based on the reports from relevant parties and my own partial observations, generally speaking, Shaanxi and Gansu have achieved a state of "no one picks up lost articles on the road, and doors are not locked at night." People often hand over lost watches, wallets, and other items to the Public Security Bureau. Farmers can leave their tools in the fields overnight without them being stolen because 99% of the people in society are good. However, the 1% of dregs—bad elements, especially counter-revolutionaries—left over from the old society have not been completely eliminated. They appear in various guises. Along the railway lines in Shaanxi, in Tongguan, Chaoyi, and Sanyuan, there were thirty robbery cases in the first quarter of this year, all of which were solved. It was found that a small number of them were fugitive landlords who refused to work and thus went out to rob and steal; the vast majority were counter-revolutionaries deliberately sabotaging agricultural cooperatives and disrupting social order. They are strange bandits who abandon the money and valuables they steal and cause harm without seeking personal gain. However, the number of thefts decreases every year, and recently it has been decreasing every month. This is partly because the masses in rural and urban areas have raised their awareness and have strict organizations, making it impossible for counter-revolutionaries to hide. In Lanzhou, seven theft cases occurred, four of which were solved by the masses. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) stipulates the implementation of "Five Guarantees" for widowers, widows, orphans, the childless elderly, and disabled veterans, ensuring their livelihood, care, education, death, and burial. This can be said to have basically eliminated poverty, improved the relationship between people, and fostered mutual love and assistance, resulting in fewer quarrels and fights. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) points out the way forward for counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and rich peasants, giving them the opportunity to start anew. It encourages many hidden counter-revolutionaries to confess and repent. The general counter-revolutionaries, seeing the vigorous development of the socialist construction of the motherland, felt the shattering of their fantasies of counter-revolutionary restoration, which also prompted them to surrender themselves. In Lanzhou alone, more than seventy counter-revolutionaries have recently surrendered themselves to the public security organs and received lenient treatment from the government.

I also visited the prisons in Xi'an and Lanzhou. I first had long talks with the prison directors and other staff, and then went into the prisons to see the lives and labor of the prisoners. The Xi'an prison has more than 1,100 prisoners, including more than 600 counter-revolutionaries. The Lanzhou prison has 925 prisoners, with counter-revolutionaries accounting for more than 70%. There are very few other criminal offenders, with ten cases of murder and four cases of mothers-in-law torturing their daughters-in-law to death, all of which are problems left over from the old society. Since the upsurge of socialism, there have been no criminal cases. Both prison directors said that the number of lawbreakers in society is decreasing day by day. From the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign last year to today, only two people have been sent to Lanzhou prison. Going into the prison, I saw that it was not like a prison, but a large factory, a shoe factory, and a clothing factory. More than a thousand people were working diligently in division of labor and cooperation, and some were even using machines, with high production enthusiasm. They seemed happy and cheerful when they worked, and everyone looked white and fat. Their products are of high quality, with durable fabrics and reasonable prices, and are sold by department stores. In 1953, the total output value of the Xi'an prison was more than 1.1 million yuan, and after expenses, more than 145,000 yuan was turned over to the state. In 1954, the total output value was more than 2 million yuan, and more than 300,000 yuan was turned over to the state. Since June of this year, prisoners can earn 5% of the profits they create as wages. Since April, special care has been given to those with skills, and advanced workers are also given rewards. From now on, prisoners can open savings accounts in banks. I saw their dormitories, with eight people living in a room, upper and lower bunks, large windows with plenty of light, and screens. Their bedding was clean and tidy, without bedbugs, mosquitoes, or lice—because they are regularly disinfected with DDT. The prisoners' food costs more than eleven yuan per month, while the average cadre only eats for thirteen yuan. When I visited the Lanzhou prison, it was mealtime, and I saw that each of them was holding a steamed bun and eating a bowl of cucumber and pork. I deliberately smiled and said to them, "You are suffering too much, not as good as being at home." They immediately replied in unison, "No, no, we don't eat this well at home." In their spare time, they have entertainment, playing chess, playing ball, and also performing plays. They watch movies once a month, and of course, they also study. The prison director led me to the library, where I saw the People's Daily, the Gansu Daily, and bookshelves with political, economic, and philosophical books, as well as classical literature, all kinds of things.

According to the labor reform regulations, prisoners can criticize and report staff members who violate the regulations. Prison administrators are not allowed to hit, scold, or lose their temper with prisoners. However, there are prisoners who do not obey the law, scold people, hit people, and act tyrannically. Cadres can only persuade them. If persuasion fails, they can only report to higher authorities for approval to add shackles and handcuffs and confine them to a room for a few days. In the past four years, only two people in the Xi'an prison have received this minor punishment. The prison director told me that beating, scolding, and punishment do not solve the problem, but rather arouse resentment. The best way is to strengthen their education and reform. He said that recently, a prisoner had appendicitis and was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. The day before yesterday, he recovered and returned, and the whole prison was shaken. Even the toughest criminals were moved to tears. In his four years as prison director, more than a dozen people with various acute illnesses have been cured and no one has died. The prison director also told me that in the past four years, there have been more than 300 prisoners sentenced to death with a reprieve, of which 300 have repented and had their sentences commuted to imprisonment. Now there are only more than 30 people who are considered sentenced to death, serving their reprieve. In other words, in the past four years, not a single prisoner has been executed here. Of the more than 200 prisoners sentenced to death with a reprieve in Xi'an prison, only two were executed. These two were truly stubborn to the end, and after reprieve after reprieve, they still did not change, so they were executed by shooting.

Fifty or sixty years ago, I saw the Wuchang prison, which was a Qing Dynasty affair. It was truly dark, dirty, and damp, with people urinating and defecating in the rooms. Prisoners wore shackles, handcuffs, or yokes and chains, and were often subjected to torture. At that time, foreigners always used the bad conditions in Chinese prisons as an excuse to refuse China's request to abolish extraterritoriality. After the Xinhai Revolution, emphasis was placed on promoting prison reform, and so-called model prisons were established in several large cities. I also visited them. Although the forms of these prisons were reformed, the content was still corrupt, dark, and inhumane. When the Kuomintang was in power, prisons were specially built for Communists. In Chongqing, there was the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," also known as "Bai Mansion," which was the mansion of the heads of Sino-American secret services, a place for training secret agents, and a prison for secret service practice. The prisoners were all communists, or progressive people and patriots suspected of being communists. I also visited that prison, which was truly a living hell. The instruments of torture used in the prison were all murderous weapons invented by American science, especially the instruments of torture for private interrogation, which were truly imaginative and appalling. Now, seeing the prisons prepared by the Chinese Communist Party for counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders, and seeing how the Communist Party "subdues people with the law" and "does not like to kill people," I truly admire the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism.

    我视察陕西甘肃的印象和感想
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员  陈崇桂
    编者按：作者陈崇桂是基督教的一位七十多岁的老牧师，现在除担任中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员、还任中国基督教三自革新爱国运动委员会的副主席、重庆神学院院长。这篇文章是他视察陕、甘两省以后写的。
    我依照政协全国委员会常务委员会决定，个人可以选择要看的地方，可以看自己要看的东西，亦可以单独进行视察，就到了陕西和甘肃。我视察的方法是拜访各地的人民法院、公安局、政治协商委员会、民主妇联，并和地方居民开座谈会和个别谈话，并且参观了西安和兰州的监狱。回到家里后，用了好几天功夫重新回忆、考虑，分析视察的结果，就治安、道德，教育三个问题写出来，请国人指教。
    一治安问题
    根据各有关方面报告，和我个人片面的观察，大体说，陕西和甘肃已经做到了“道不拾遗，夜不闭户”，经常有人将拾到的手表、钱包等物送到公安局招领。农民在田里工作，晚上回家，将农具留在田里，也不会丢失，因为社会上99％都是好人。但是从旧社会遗留下来的1％的渣子——坏人，特别是反革命分子，还没有完全肃清。他们以各式各样的姿态出现。在陕西铁路的沿线上，潼关、朝邑、三原，今年第一季度发生了三十件抢劫案，都破获了，发现他们中最少数是逃亡地主，不肯劳动，因而出外抢劫、偷窃；绝大多数是反革命分子，故意破坏农业合作社，扰乱社会治安。他们是奇怪的土匪，抢劫了却丢弃钱财不要，害命却不是为谋财。但是，盗窃数字年年下降，近来是月月下降。这一方面是因为在农村和城市中，群众觉悟提高了，有了严密的组织，使反革命分子隐藏不住。兰州市发生了盗窃案七件，四件是由群众破获的。全国农业发展纲要（草案）规定了对鳏寡孤独、残废军人施行“五保”，使他们的生、养、教、死、葬都有所依靠，可说是基本上消灭了贫穷，使人与人的关系改善了，人人彼此相爱互助，很少再争吵打架了。农业发展纲要（草案）给反革命分子和地主富农指出了出路，使他们有重新做人的机会，鼓励了许多暗藏的反革命分子自首投案、悔过自新。一般反革命分子看到祖国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，感到了反革命复辟幻想的破灭，也促使他们投案自首。只兰州市，近来就有七十多个反革命分子自动到公安机关自首，得到政府的宽大处理。
    我也参观了西安和兰州的监狱。我先和监狱长和其他工作同志作长时间的谈话，然后进监去查看犯人的生活和劳动。西安监狱共有犯人一千一百多，内有反革命分子六百多。兰州监狱有犯人925人，反革命分子占百分之七十强。其他刑事犯甚少，有谋杀案十件、婆婆折磨死媳妇案四件，皆是旧社会遗留下的问题。社会主义高潮以后，更没见刑事案，两处监狱长都说，社会上犯法的人日渐减少，从去年肃反运动直到今日，送入兰州监狱的，不过两个人。进监去看，才看见并不像监狱，乃是一个大工厂、制鞋厂、缝衣厂。一千多人在那里分工合作，勤恳劳动，有的人还用机器，生产情绪很高。他们工作时候，似乎快乐高兴，人人长得白胖白胖的。他们生产的产品质量高、布料坚实，价廉物美，由百货公司包销。西安监狱1953年生产总值一百一十多万，除开支外，上缴十四万五千多；1954年生产总值二百多万，上缴三十多万。自今年六月起，犯人生利，可得工资百分之五，从四月份起，对有技术者还特别照顾，对先进分子还给奖励。此后，犯人可以在银行中开户储蓄。我看了他们的宿舍，八个人住一间房，上下铺位，房内大窗户，光线充足，有纱窗。他们的铺盖干净整齐，无臭虫、蚊子、虱子——因为常打滴滴涕消毒。犯人伙食每月十一元多，一般干部也只吃十三元。我去兰州监狱参观时，正值他们吃饭，看见他们每个人手中拿个馍馍啃，面前放着一碗黄瓜烧肉。我故意笑着对他们说：“你们太吃苦呀，比不上在家里好。”他们即刻异口同声回答说：“不，不，我们在家没吃这么好。”业余时间，他们有娱乐，下棋、打球、也演戏，每月看电影一次，当然也有学习。监狱长引导我到图书室，看见有人民日报、甘肃日报，书架上有政治、经济、哲学书，还有古典文学书，琳琅满目。
    按照劳改条例，工作人员若违反条例，犯人可以批评检举。监狱管理员对于犯人不许打、不许骂、不许发脾气。犯人中倒有不服从法纪的，骂人、打人，横行霸道。干部对他们只能说服。说服不了，只能呈报上级批准，加上脚镣手铐，关在房中几天。近四年中，西安监狱也只有两个人受过这点小刑罚。监狱长对我说，打、骂、刑罚不解决问题，反引起恶感。最好的办法是加强对他们的教育改造，他说，近来一犯人患盲肠炎，马上送入医院治疗，前天痊愈回来，全监震动，连最强硬的凶犯也感动得流泪，在他做监狱长的四年内，患各种急性病的十几人，都治好了，没死一个人。监狱长还告诉我，四年之内，判决死刑缓期执行的犯人有三百多人，其中悔过自新改为徒刑的有三百人。现在只剩下三十多人算是死刑，在缓刑中。换而言之，在四年之内，这里没有处死一个犯人。西安监狱内判决死刑缓期执行的二百多犯人，执行死刑的不过两个人。这两个人真是顽固到底，缓刑又缓刑，依然不改，才执行枪决的。
    前五、六十年，我看过武昌监狱，那是清朝的事，那里面真是黑暗、肮脏、潮湿，大小便都在房内，犯人带着脚镣、手铐、或是枷锁铁链，还经常受到拷打。那时，外国人总是拿着中国监狱坏为借口，拒绝中国取消治外法权的要求。辛亥革命后，着重提倡改良监狱，在几个大城市建立所谓模范监狱，我也去参观过。这些监狱形式虽然是改良了，内容还是腐败、黑暗、惨无人道。到了国民党独裁的时候，特为共产党人建立了监狱。在重庆的有“中美合作所”，又名“白公馆”，这是中美特务头子的公馆、训练特务的场所，又是特务实习的监狱，犯人都是共产党员，或是有共产党嫌疑的进步人士、爱国人士。那监狱我也参观过，那真是人间地狱。狱中所用的刑具，都是美国科学发明的杀人利器，尤其是私刑审讯的刑具，真是异想天开，惨不忍睹。现在看见了中国共产党为反革命分子和刑事犯所预备的监狱，看见了共产党怎样“以法服人”“不嗜杀人”，真叫我佩服马列主义的思想武器。
