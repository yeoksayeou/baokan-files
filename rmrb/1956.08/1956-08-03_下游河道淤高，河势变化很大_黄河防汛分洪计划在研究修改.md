Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st – Due to the silting up of the Yellow River downstream from Aishan and significant changes in the river course, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is studying revisions to the original flood control and diversion plan.

The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission flood control inspection team recently conducted an inspection of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The results showed that from Mengjin County, Henan Province, downstream to Aishan, Dong'e County, Shandong Province, most sections of the riverbed have experienced severe silting since 1953. The Qinchang section near the west side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Yellow River Iron Bridge has silted up by 1.5 meters, Gaocun in Dongming County has silted up by 0.93 meters, and Sunkou in Shouzhang County has silted up by 0.07 meters. When the second flood peak of the Yellow River reached Gaocun, Dongming County this year, the flow rate was less than 7,000 cubic meters per second, but the water level was still 0.02 meters higher than the water level of the maximum flow of 12,000 cubic meters per second in 1954. At the same time, the changes in the downstream river course are also very drastic. Some dangerous sections have become safe, while some ordinary sections have become strained. After the Shi Wangzhuang and Xingmiao dangerous sections in Fan County, Shandong Province, became safe, the embankments are no longer submerged in ordinary floods. The main current that had been directly impacting the Sunkou dangerous section in Shouzhang County for many years has shifted downstream, making Sunkou safe; Jia Zhuang downstream of Sunkou has become tense due to the river water encircling and impacting it. When the temporary flood control project to defend against abnormal floods was designed in 1954, the river current near Shitou Zhuang in Changyuan County, Henan Province, was close to the north bank, which facilitated flood diversion, but now the current near Shitou Zhuang has moved outward. There are many similar situations. As a result, new situations have arisen, such as a decrease in flood discharge capacity at the same water level and a rise in water level at the same flow rate. Once an abnormal flood is encountered and flood diversion is carried out, the outflow from each diversion gate will be greater than the designed figure.

Based on these new circumstances, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has decided to conduct further research and calculations on the location of the previously selected temporary flood diversion gates, the inflow volume, and the flood diversion water level, to revise the temporary flood control measures, and to make new plans and deployments for the embankment sections that are about to become new dangerous sections.

### 下游河道淤高，河势变化很大  黄河防汛分洪计划在研究修改

    下游河道淤高，河势变化很大
    黄河防汛分洪计划在研究修改
    据新华社郑州31日电　黄河下游艾山以上河道淤高，河势变化很大，因此黄河水利委员会正在研究修改原定的防汛分洪计划。
    黄河水利委员会防汛检查组最近在黄河下游作了检查。结果查明：黄河下游河南省孟津县以下到山东省东阿县艾山，从1953年到现在，大部分河段的河底发生严重的淤高现象。京汉铁路黄河铁桥西面附近的秦厂一段淤高一点五公尺，东明县高村淤高零点九三公尺，寿张县孙口淤高七公分。今年黄河第二次洪峰到达东明县高村时，流量还不到七千秒公方，可是水位却比1954年最大流量一万二千秒公方的水位还高二公分。同时，下游河势的变化也很厉害。有的险工脱了险，有的平工段却变得吃紧了。山东省范县史王庄和邢庙险工脱险后，在一般的洪水下，堤坝已经不着水。多年顶冲寿张县孙口险工的主溜，已经向下游推移，使孙口脱险；孙口下游的贾庄却因河水坐湾顶冲而紧张起来。当1954年设计防御异常洪水的临时防洪工程时，河南省长垣县石头庄附近的河水溜势靠北岸，便利分洪，而现在石头庄附近的溜势已经外移。类似这样的情况很多。因此，产生了在同一水位下泄洪能力减低，在同一流量下水位抬高等新情况。当一旦遭遇异常洪水而分洪时，各分洪口门的出水量将多于设计数字。
    黄河水利委员会根据这些新情况，决定对以前所选定的临时分洪口门位置进洪流量和分洪水位等做进一步的研究计算，对临时防洪措施加以修正，并且对即将成为新险工的堤段做出新的计划和部署。
