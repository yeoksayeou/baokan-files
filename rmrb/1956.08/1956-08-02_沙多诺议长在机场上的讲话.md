Speaker Sartono's Speech at the Airport

My respected Mr. Liu Shaoqi, I am very glad to have safely arrived in the capital of the People's Republic of China.

On behalf of our delegation, I express my deep gratitude to Mr. Liu Shaoqi and other leaders for inviting us to visit your country. I would like to take this opportunity to convey the respect of the Indonesian people to the Chinese people. I hope that this visit of mine and my companions will further consolidate the inherent good relations between our two peoples. I deliberately brought my wife with me on this visit because I heard that many leaders' wives here do not like to attend social occasions. Indonesian women, especially my wife, always follow me when I go out, and I could not refuse her request this time.

Gentlemen, our stay in your capital will not be long, because we belong to the type of people who must quickly return to continue working; but soon, on September 8th, the Indonesian Parliament will send a large delegation. This delegation has twenty-five members, and it may cause you gentlemen some trouble.

This delegation will stay for about twenty days. Therefore, it will have a better opportunity than I do to get in touch with you.

Gentlemen: Since yesterday, I have been within the territory of the People's Republic of China. Yesterday we spent the night in Guangzhou, and just this noon we got off the plane in Hankou for a short rest. Gentlemen, I thank you for the warm and friendly welcome you have shown us in various places. At this moment, I see again how friendly you are to us. Please believe that we, the Indonesian people, also watch your actions and struggles with friendly feelings, and these actions and struggles have already achieved many successes in construction.

Gentlemen! I once again express my gratitude, thanking the leaders for welcoming us so warmly here.

    沙多诺议长在机场上的讲话
    我所尊敬的刘少奇先生，我很高兴现在平安地抵达了中华人民共和国的首都。
    我代表我们一行人向刘少奇先生和其他的首长表示深切的感谢，因为他们邀请了我们访问贵国。　　我愿意趁此机会向中国人民转达印度尼西亚人民对中国人民的敬意。希望我和我的同伴们这次的访问，将进一步巩固两国人民的固有的良好关系。　　这次我故意带我的夫人来访问，因为我听说，这里有许多首长的太太不喜欢出席社交场合。印度尼西亚的妇女，尤其是我的太太，假若我出去的话，她必定跟随着，这次我也不能拒绝她的要求。
    各位先生们，我们逗留在贵首都的时间是不长的，因为我们是属于必需迅速回去继续工作的一类人；但不久，印度尼西亚国会将于九月八号派遣一个庞大的代表团。这个代表团有二十五个团员，它可能给各位先生带来麻烦。
    这个代表团将逗留约二十天。因此，它将有比我更好的机会来和你们接触。
    先生们：从昨天起我就在中华人民共和国的国境内，昨天我们在广州过夜，而刚才中午又在汉口下飞机稍为休息。先生们，我感谢你们在各地所表示的对我们充满着友谊的欢迎。这个时候，我又看到你们对我们是多么的友好。请你们相信，我们印度尼西亚人民也以充满着友好的心情来注视着你们的行动和斗争，这些行动和斗争目前已经在建设方面取得很多成绩。
    各位先生！我再一次表示感谢，感谢各位首长和领导人这样热情地在这里迎接我们。
