Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. A national symposium on schistosomiasis treatment was held in Shanghai from the 2nd to the 8th. The symposium conducted detailed discussions on short-course antimony therapy for schistosomiasis, several traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions and therapies, and related scientific research issues.

The representatives attending the symposium believed that short-course antimony therapy is the direction for large-scale schistosomiasis treatment. They focused on studying reports from various regions on the short-course antimony treatment of two thousand schistosomiasis patients over the past five months, and concluded that this therapy is relatively safe and has a certain therapeutic effect. However, the number of treated cases is still small, and the follow-up and re-examination work is still short, so it is recommended that medical research institutions in various regions continue to treat 4,500 people with three-day and seven-day therapies before the end of September, and conduct treatment observations simultaneously in qualified prevention and treatment institutions in various regions to study its therapeutic effect. The representatives also drafted a standard for checking the therapeutic effect of schistosomiasis, and suggested that provinces and cities make unified inspection records to obtain correct therapeutic effects.

The representatives studied the proven prescriptions and acupuncture therapies provided by ten provinces and cities in terms of traditional Chinese medicine. Some people at the meeting also pointed out that medical institutions in various regions have not paid enough attention to the research and application of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of schistosomiasis. The representatives suggested focusing on the trial use of insecticidal compound Litsea cubeba tablets, Phyllanthus urinaria roots and Ailanthus altissima root bark (for external use) to eliminate liver and spleen enlargement, Lobelia chinensis to eliminate ascites, and acupuncture therapy to stop antimony reactions. In addition, for eleven other traditional Chinese medicines, the representatives suggested that the prevention and treatment institutions in various provinces and cities continue to study and confirm the therapeutic effects.

    全国血吸虫病治疗工作座谈会在上海举行
    认为锑剂短程疗法是今后大规模治疗的努力方向
    据新华社上海9日电　全国血吸虫病治疗工作座谈会二日到八日在上海举行。座谈会对血吸虫病的锑剂短程疗法和几种中医验方及其疗法，以及有关科学研究的问题作了详尽的讨论。
    参加座谈会的代表认为锑剂短程疗法是展开大规模治疗血吸虫病的努力方向，他们着重研究了各地五个月来锑剂短程治疗两千个血吸虫病人的报告，认为这种疗法是比较安全的，而且有一定疗效。但是治疗例数还不多，随访复查工作还短，因此建议各地医学研究机构在九月底以前采取三日疗法和七日疗法继续治疗四千五百人，在各地有条件的防治机构同时进行治疗观察，研究它的治疗效果。代表们还拟订了血吸虫病治疗效果检查标准草稿，建议各省市作统一检查的纪录，以得出正确的疗效。
    代表们在中医中药方面研究了十个省市提供的验方和针刺疗法。会上还有人提出各地医疗机构在治疗血吸虫病中对研究和采用中药还不够重视。代表们建议重点试用杀虫类的复方荜澄茄片，消除肝脾肿大的猪儿草根和臭椿树根皮（外用），消除腹水的半边莲和能够制止锑剂反应的针刺疗法。另外，还有十一种中药，代表们建议由各省市的防治机构继续研究，肯定治疗效果。
