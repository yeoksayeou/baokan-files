Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 14th. The New Port Sluice Gate officially reopened on the 13th after its first major overhaul in ten years. Fully loaded ocean freighters of 3,000 tons can now pass through here at any time to enter Tianjin city.

At 5:00 PM on the 13th, a tugboat towing a barge loaded with goods sailed from the Hai River. The ship's whistle sounded a signal to enter the lock, and the "Permission to Enter Lock" sign was immediately raised. Workers opened the culverts under the west gate to equalize the water level inside the lock with the river. The electrician on duty in the control room started the fully automated equipment, and a huge horizontal sliding gate slowly moved backward. After four minutes and fifteen seconds, the gate was fully opened, and the ship entered the lock chamber. After the water level in the lock was again equalized with the sea, the east gate was then opened. At this time, the ship climbed over a water staircase and entered the sea.

The New Port Sluice Gate is the throat connecting the Bohai Sea and the Hai River. Due to years of use, the gate leaked a lot of water and could not be used except during high tides. Large ships needing to enter or exit Tianjin had to wait for the tide outside the gate or unload part of their cargo and detour through the shallower Dagukou old channel. After the major overhaul, the New Port Sluice Gate can now operate day and night, and its efficiency will be more than doubled.

### 塘沽新港船闸大修后正式启用  三千吨货轮可直接进入天津市区

    塘沽新港船闸大修后正式启用
    三千吨货轮可直接进入天津市区
    新华社天津14日电　新港船闸经过十年来第一次大修后，十三日又正式启用了。三千吨满载的海洋轮船，可以在任何时候都能通过这里进入天津市区。
    十三日下午五点钟，一艘拖轮拖着满载货物的驳船从海河驶来。船上汽笛发出叫闸信号，闸上立即升起“准许进闸”的标志，工人们打开了西闸门水下的涵洞，让闸内水位与河水调平。操纵室值班的电工开动了完全自动化的设备，一座巨大的平推式闸门徐徐向后移动。过了四分零十五秒，闸门完全启开，轮船进入了闸槽。当闸内水位又与海水调平以后，东闸门随即启放。这时，轮船就爬过了一层水上阶梯进入大海了。
    新港船闸是连接渤海与海河的咽喉。由于使用年久，闸门大量漏水，非潮水高涨时不能使用，需要进出天津的大船，只得在闸外候潮或者卸掉一部分货物，绕经吃水较浅的大沽口旧航道。新港船闸经过大修以后，可以日夜通航，使用效率将提高一倍以上。
