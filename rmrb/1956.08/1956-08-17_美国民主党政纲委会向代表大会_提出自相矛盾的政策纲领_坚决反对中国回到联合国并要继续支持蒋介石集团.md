Xinhua News Agency, August 16th, Chicago Dispatch: The Democratic Party Platform Committee presented the policy platform it drafted for the Democratic Party to the party's convention on August 15th. If the Democratic Party wins the election, this platform will become its guiding policy for the next four years.

The section on foreign policy in the platform addresses the attitude towards the United Nations. It states that the Democratic Party is committed to strengthening and expanding the effectiveness and role of the United Nations. However, it also expresses "determination to oppose" the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations and wants to continue supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group.

When discussing the Middle East issue, the platform criticizes "the incompetence and vacillation of Republican policy," which it claims led to the Suez Canal crisis. It expresses support for "the principle of free passage through the Suez Canal under appropriate international auspices."

The Democratic platform attacks Eisenhower for "not resolutely seeking peace because his disarmament policy has not heavily struck the war system. His handling of daily international problems unnecessarily and dangerously exposed the American people to the risk of an atomic world war." It also accuses the Republican government of failing to propose any new concrete measures in the entire year since Eisenhower attended the summit to "deal with the Soviet Union's new type of political and economic offensive." The platform argues that Republicans have "weakened" the Democratic Party's "active policy" of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism.

As the Democratic Party's positive proposition, the platform on the one hand expresses support for effective disarmament based on a plan that is "universal, effective, and compulsorily implemented," and on the other hand, it advocates that the United States must have "sufficient" armed forces, demanding "the restoration of the Democratic Party's policy of seeking peace through strength." It also advocates the realization of "economic unity" and "political unity" in Western Europe and the strengthening of solidarity among the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The section on civil rights in the Democratic Party policy platform is another prominent collection of contradictions. On the one hand, it expresses support for the Supreme Court's ruling abolishing racial discrimination in schools, and on the other hand, it expresses opposition to the compulsory enforcement of this ruling. This is the result of mutual compromise between northern Democrats and southern Democrats. This platform will open the door for southern Democrats to continue implementing their racial discrimination system.

    美国民主党政纲委会向代表大会
    提出自相矛盾的政策纲领
    坚决反对中国回到联合国并要继续支持蒋介石集团
    新华社16日讯　芝加哥消息：民主党纲领委员会八月十五日向这个党的代表大会提出了它所草拟的民主党的政策纲领。如果民主党在选举中获胜，这个纲领就将成为它在今后四年中的施政方针。
    纲领中关于外交政策部分谈到对联合国的态度。它说，民主党要致力于加强和扩大联合国的效能和作用。可是，它同时又表示“决心反对”恢复中国在联合国的席位，并且要继续支持蒋介石集团。
    纲领在谈到中东问题的时候指责“共和党政策的无能和游移不定”招致了苏彝士运河的危机。它表示赞成“在适当的国际主持下自由通过苏彝士运河的原则”。
    民主党纲领抨击艾森豪威尔“没有坚决地寻求和平，因为他的裁军政策没有沉重地打击战争制度。他处理日常国际问题的做法，不必要地、危险地使美国人民冒了原子世界大战的危险”。它还指责共和党政府在艾森豪威尔参加最高级会议以来的一整年中，没有提出丝毫新的具体办法来“对付苏联的新型的政治和经济攻势”。这个纲领认为，共和党人“削弱了”民主党的反苏反共的“积极政策”。
    作为民主党的正面主张，这个纲领一方面表示支持根据“普遍的、有效的、强制实行”的计划进行有效的裁军，另一方面又鼓吹美国必须有“足够的”武装力量，要求“恢复民主党的通过实力谋求和平的政策”。它还主张实现西欧的“经济统一”和“政治统一”，并且加强北大西洋集团国家之间的团结。
    民主党政策纲领中关于公民权利的部分是另一个突出的矛盾的集合体，它一方面表示赞成最高法院废除学校中的种族歧视的裁决，一方面又表示反对强制执行这种裁决。这是北部民主党人和南部民主党人互相妥协的结果。这个纲领将为南部民主党人继续实行他们的种族歧视制度而大开方便之门。
