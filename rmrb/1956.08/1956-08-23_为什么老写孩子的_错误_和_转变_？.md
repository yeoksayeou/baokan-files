Why Always Write About Children's "Mistakes" and "Transformations"?
    Ye Xiu

    The two one-act plays performed by the China Children's Theatre for its inaugural performance, "How the Little Fly Became an Elephant" and "Summer is Here," have fairly interesting stories. However, after watching them, something seemed to weigh on my heart. I thought about this question: Why do we always write about children's "mistakes" and "transformations"?

    It should be said that these two short plays are relatively good in portraying children's lives and depicting their characters, and their performances are also welcomed by children. However, works that write about children's "mistakes" and "transformations" are almost "everywhere," to give a random example:

    The "Dalian Daily" published on May 27, "Collection of Works for Children's and Youth Literature," "Military Knife," which tells the story of a child who picked up an old lady's small knife, and was also "disturbed," and later told everything to the counselor teacher. The counselor teacher "praised his behavior of bravely admitting his mistake, and said that this is a good behavior, and students who have made mistakes should learn from him."

    Similar stories have almost become formulas, nothing more than: committing a "mistake" -- "ideological struggle" -- "confessing" to the teacher, and finally encouraging them. When writing about children's ideological struggles, it is always depicted as very painful, unable to eat or sleep, and the mother or teacher even suspects that he is sick, touching his head and asking him if he is uncomfortable...

    In terms of subject matter, the stories of children's "backwardness turning to progress," are as narrow as the "picking up money and not pocketing it" and "closing windows on rainy nights" of the "new people and new things" that have been written to death, reflecting the writers' unfamiliarity with children's lives, and they can only fabricate stories based on a few concepts. The stories that are fabricated in this way are bound to be similar.

    Do children make these or those mistakes? Yes. But their mistakes are different from those of adults. Sometimes it is because of ignorance; sometimes it is because of a lack of willpower and they cannot restrain themselves;... When we analyze children's mistakes and shortcomings, we must not forget their age characteristics. To make children engage in ideological struggles, confess, and cry like adults, also shows that our writers do not understand children deeply, because in life, children's mistakes and shortcomings are often not overcome in the kind of painful way that writers describe.

    Some authors of children's literature are teachers, and they should be more familiar with children. But some teachers are particularly prone to seeing students' shortcomings, and always want to teach children impatiently in their works, hoping that children with similar mistakes or shortcomings can immediately "transform" like the protagonist after reading the work.

    Works that describe how children overcome shortcomings, as long as they are written truthfully, cannot be said to be meaningless to children. But why are writers so enthusiastic about such subjects? Why artificially create "transformations"? Why not reflect more of their wit, liveliness, and courageous image (of course, it must also be reflected truthfully)? I want to make two requests on behalf of the children: First, the subject matter should be broad; second, it should be written truthfully.

### 为什么老写孩子的“错误”和“转变”？

    为什么老写孩子的“错误”和“转变”？
    叶秀
    中国儿童剧院建院公演的两个独幕剧——“小苍蝇是怎样变成大象的”和“夏天来了”，故事都相当有趣。但是看完以后，心上却有点压着什么似的。我想到这么一个问题：为什么老写孩子的“错误”和“转变”？
    应该说，这两个短剧在表现儿童生活和刻划儿童性格方面，还是比较好的，它们的演出，也受到孩子们的欢迎。可是，写孩子们的“错误”和“转变”的作品，也真是几乎“俯拾即是”，随手举个例子来说吧：
    五月二十七日“旅大日报”发表的“少年儿童文学读物应征作品”“军用小刀”，写一个孩子拾了邻居老太太的一把小刀，也是“闹得心神不安”，后来也是把一切都对辅导员老师说了。辅导员老师对他“勇敢承认错误的行为，作了表扬，并说这是一种优良行为，要犯了错误的同学向他学习。”
    类此的故事几乎成了公式，不外是：犯了“错误”——“思想斗争”——向老师“坦白”，最后是勉励一番。在写孩子的思想斗争的时候，也总是描绘得很痛苦，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着，妈妈或者老师还疑心他病了，摸他的头，问他有什么不舒服，……
    在题材方面，孩子“落后转变”的故事，正如写烂了的“拾金不昧”、“雨夜关窗”的“新人新事”那样狭窄，反映了作家对于儿童生活的生疏，他们只能根据几个概念来编造故事。这样编出来的故事，就必然是差不多的。
    孩子们是不是会犯这些或者那些错误呢？会的。但是他们的错误，跟成人的不同。他们有时是因为无知；有时是因为缺乏意志力，还不能克制自己；……我们在分析孩子的错误和缺点的时候，不能忘了他们的年龄特点。让孩子像成人似地来思想斗争，来坦白，来痛哭流涕，也正是说明了我们的作家没有深入地了解儿童，因为在生活里面，孩子们的错误和缺点的克服，往往并不像作家所描写的那种样子的痛苦。
    有些儿童文学作品的作者是教师，他们应该对孩子比较熟悉。但有些教师特别容易看到学生的缺点，而且总想在作品里迫不及待地来教训孩子，希望有类似错误或缺点的孩子，读了作品以后，跟主人公一样，立刻就能“转变”。
    描写孩子怎样克服缺点的作品，只要写得真实，对孩子不能说没有意义。但是为什么作家们要那样热中于这样的题材呢？为什么要人为地制造“转变”呢？为什么不多多反映他们的机智、活泼、勇敢的形象（当然也要反映得真实）呢？我要替孩子们提出两个要求：一、题材要广泛；二、要写得真实。
