Director Li Holds a Funeral
Xu Xiaomin

The Guangrao County People's Committee in Shandong Province received an official letter from the Personnel Bureau of Zhejiang Province, the gist of which was: Li Ruixiang, the acting director of the Meteorological Bureau of our province, is from Lijiaqiao Village, Liuji District, your county. According to his own report, the funeral expenses were excessive, exceeding the expenses of ordinary people. Li requested financial assistance from the state. We hereby request your assistance in investigating: Director Li's funeral expenses, family situation, and the reactions of local people after the funeral.

The following is the result of the investigation.

At the end of March, after Director Li received a telegram about his mother's death, he took money and returned home to hold the funeral. As soon as Director Li arrived home, he specifically invited a close paternal uncle to organize the funeral, handing over a large sum of funeral expenses on the spot and instructing, "Spend generously, and there will be ways to get more money if it's not enough."

The first heartbreaking thing this "filial son" encountered was that he couldn't buy a good coffin locally. He had to have one modified and painted with bright lacquer. Since the coffin wasn't good enough, he had to make more of a show of the grave. Director Li hired a well-known local craftsman to build a beautiful double tomb (including a tomb for his not-yet-deceased father). The four walls of the tomb were adorned with a gatehouse, with beautiful and moving flowers painted on the gatehouse, along with the couplet: "Once bidding farewell to the red world, resting in white clouds for a thousand autumns."

The day of the funeral was truly a sensation in the surrounding areas. Early in the morning, gongs and drums resounded, and ancient music played. People from all around had long heard about the grandeur of this "grand funeral," so grandfathers led grandsons, and mothers held children, all coming to see a spectacle unseen for many years. Inside the red and green decorated canopy was Director Li's mother's coffin, painted clean and bright, with golden phoenixes and the golden characters "Purple Qi Comes from the East, Jade Pool Viewed from the West." In addition, there were dazzling paper tables, paper chairs, paper boxes, paper buildings, and money sticks…everything that could be used in death.

"Raising children is for old age and funerals. Dying is a blessing to have such a good son," said an old woman, holding her grandson, staring intently at the "filial son" in the funeral procession—Director Li—telling her grandson, "Child! Look how good he is. You must learn to be so successful when you grow up."

Young people, however, had different opinions.

"So feudal and superstitious. And he's supposed to be a revolutionary cadre!"

"The co-op members invest in buying bricks and digging wells, while the director spends money on a funeral; the co-op is digging wells and preparing for planting every day, and his funeral brings so many people to delay work." This was the opinion of a member of an agricultural production cooperative.

A woman with a child chimed in, "Did you know? The co-op also sent sixty or seventy workers to help with his funeral, not counting the other helpers! These days, a lot of the co-op's work has been delayed!"

Naturally, Director Li in the funeral procession could not hear these comments from onlookers. He walked silently, seemingly sorrowful, but in his heart, he was very pleased with the funeral.

At noon, the burial took place. Ancient music played a farewell song, and paper ashes fluttered in the air, attracting everyone's attention from far and near.

However, the funeral did not end there. Director Li also hosted a banquet for relatives, friends, and neighbors. Using his status as director, he personally went to the local district office to get 150 jin of wheat, choosing an auspicious day to hold a large banquet, filling five tables completely.

After Director Li expressed his thanks, the banquet began.

"Three Peach Garden!" "Five Ones!" "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea!" The sounds of drinking games and boisterous chatter blended into one. If you passed by here, you might think it was a wedding!

After the funeral, the old man who organized it calculated the expenses, totaling 486 yuan.

This is the origin of Director Li's request for "state relief."

    李局长办丧事
    徐晓民
    山东省广饶县人民委员会接到浙江省人事局公函一件，大意是：本省气象局代理局长李瑞祥同志，系你县刘集区李家桥村人，母亲病逝。据本人反映，花去埋葬费数字过大，超过一般群众的开支，李要求国家救济。特函请协助本局调查：李局长办丧事的开支、家庭情况和丧葬后当地群众的反映。
    下面就是调查来的情况。
    三月底，李局长接到母亲病逝的电报后，就带着钱回家举办丧事。李局长一到家，就专门请了近族叔父主办丧事，当场双手交付一大笔丧费，并嘱咐道：“花钱要大方，钱不够还有办法。”
    这位“孝子”碰到的第一件伤心事，是当地买不到好棺材。只好加一加工，用油漆刷亮。棺材既然不好，就只好在坟上多作文章。李局长请了当地有名的工匠，修一座漂亮的双身坟（包括未死的父亲的寿坟）。那坟的四壁，修了门楼，门楼上面画着美丽动人的花草，还写着“一旦辞红世，千秋卧白云”的对联。
    出殡的那天，真是轰动远近。清早，锣鼓喧天，古乐齐鸣，四乡的人们早就听说这个“大出丧”的气派，于是祖父搀着孙孙，母亲抱着孩子，都来观看多少年来没有过的盛典。那装饰的红红绿绿的彩罩里面，放着李局长母亲的灵柩，油漆得净光透亮，还画着金色的凤凰，写着“东来紫气，西望瑶池”的金字。此外还有使人眼光缭乱的纸桌、纸椅，纸箱、纸楼、捍钱杖……，死后花的用的应有尽有。
    “养儿为了养老送终，有这样的好儿子，死了也享福。”一位搀着孙子的老太太目不转睛地望着出丧队伍中的“孝子”——李局长，对孙子说：“孩子！你看人家多好，你长大了也要学这样有出息。”
    青年人却另有主见。
    “又封建，又迷信。还算是个革命干部哩！”
    “社员们投资买砖打井，局长花钱出殡；社里天天打井备耕，他出殡引这多人来耽误干活。”——这是一位农业生产合作社的社员的意见。
    旁边一位带孩子的妇女插嘴说：“你知道吗？合作社里还派了六七十个工给他出殡，另外帮忙的人还不算数哪！这几天社里的活耽误不少哩！”
    自然，送殡行列里的李局长是听不到这些旁观者的议论的。他默默地走着，貌似哀戚，心里却很为这场丧事满意。
    正午安葬。古乐奏起送终曲，纸灰在空中纷纷飘舞，惹得远近人人注意。
    可是，丧事却没有就此了结。李局长还要设宴招待亲友乡邻。凭着局长的身份，亲自到当地区公所要来一百五十斤小麦，选择吉日，大设宴席，整整坐满了五桌。
    李局长略表谢意后，宴会开始。
    “三桃园！”“五魁首！”“八仙过海！”酒令声、喧哗声酿成一团，如果你从这里路过，也许会认为是办喜事哩！
    丧后，主办丧事的老人给算了一笔账，整整用出四百八十六元。
    这就是李局长请求“国家救济”的来由。
