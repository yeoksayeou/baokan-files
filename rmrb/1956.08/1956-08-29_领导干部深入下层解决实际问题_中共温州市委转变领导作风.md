    Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Grassroots to Solve Practical Problems
    CPC Wenzhou Municipal Committee Changes Leadership Style

    (Our Newspaper) This is news. At the First Congress of the CPC Wenzhou Municipal Committee, the representatives raised many criticisms of the work of the previous CPC Wenzhou Municipal Committee, believing that the Municipal Committee had serious bureaucratic work styles in the past, which hindered the progress of various tasks.

    The new Municipal Committee, based on the opinions reflected by the representatives, began to change its work style. For example, Zhang Jimin, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, personally went to factories and cooperatives to understand the production and living conditions of workers and members, and instructed the leaders of factories and enterprises to improve some equipment. The Municipal Committee also held forums with workers and intellectuals, listened to their specific opinions on work, production, and welfare, and prepared to solve them appropriately in a planned way. The Secretary of the Municipal Committee and the Mayor, together with the heads of various departments, also organized visiting groups to visit the families of employees and intellectuals, deeply understand and solve the difficulties in the lives of employees. In the past month or so, Wenzhou City's drought has been very serious. Comrade Liu Shen, a member of the Municipal Committee who had been severely criticized by representatives at the Party Congress, also personally went to the countryside to work with farmers to study drought resistance. The Municipal Committee also organized cadres from city organs and some employees to assist farmers in drought resistance. The Secretary of the Municipal Committee and the heads of various departments all participated in the drought resistance work together with all organ cadres. All these situations are a gratifying change in the leadership style of the Municipal Committee after the Party's First Municipal Congress, which has been welcomed by all Party members and the people of the city, and has also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the working people.

    领导干部深入下层解决实际问题
    中共温州市委转变领导作风
    本报讯　在中共温州市第一次代表大会上，代表们对前届中共温州市委员会工作提出了不少批评意见，认为市委在过去的工作中有严重的官僚主义作风，因而阻碍了各项工作的前进。
    新的市委会根据代表们反映的意见，开始转变工作作风。如市委副书记张济民同志已亲自到工厂、合作社中了解了工人、社员的生产、生活情况，并责成工厂企业的领导人改善了些设备。市委还召开了工人和知识分子座谈会，听取了他们对有关工作、生产和生活福利方面的具体意见，准备有计划地加以适当解决。市委书记、市长同各部门负责人还组织了访问组，对职工、知识分子家属进行了访问，深入了解和解决职工生活上的困难问题。最近一个多月来，温州市的旱情很严重，在党代表大会上曾经受到代表们严格批评的市委委员刘沈同志，也亲自跑到农村和农民们一起研究抗旱工作；市委还组织了全市机关干部和部分职工去协助农民进行抗旱工作。市委书记和各部部长们都和全体机关干部一起参加了抗旱工作。所有这些情况都是在党的全市第一次代表大会后，市委领导作风的可喜转变，因而受到了全体党员和全市群众的欢迎；同时也大大地鼓舞了劳动人民的生产积极性。　　（徐适存）
