Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 17th: Bonn dispatch: The West German Federal Constitutional Court, disregarding the opposition of the entire German people and at the cost of violating the spirit of the constitution, has finally, according to the wishes of the Adenauer government, declared the German Communist Party illegal today.

The Federal Constitutional Court, in its verdict, insisted that the German Communist Party violated the constitution and announced that it would dissolve the German Communist Party and confiscate its property. It also announced a ban on "establishing substitute organizations for the German Communist Party or using existing organizations as substitutes."

According to this court ruling, mass organizations such as the Free German Youth League are also subject to suppression. Furthermore, some local German Communist Party members of parliament will be deprived of their seats.

After the Federal Constitutional Court announced its verdict, the Adenauer government immediately dispatched a large number of police to seal off German Communist Party headquarters in various locations, confiscate German Communist Party property and documents, and close down German Communist Party newspapers. In Hamburg, the police also arrested some German Communist Party staff.

The Adenauer authorities' barbaric measures to ban the German Communist Party have aroused strong protests from all sectors of German society. In West Berlin, the people held many protest rallies. At the German Communist Party headquarters in Düsseldorf, a huge red flag was raised, and a huge slogan was hung on the wall of the headquarters, which read: "Despite the ban, the German Communist Party continues to exist."

    不顾全德人民的反对
    西德宪法法院违宪宣布德共为非法
    据新华社柏林17日电　波恩消息：西德联邦宪法法院不顾全德人民的反对，不惜违背宪法的精神，终于按照阿登纳政府的意旨在今天宣布德国共产党为非法。
    联邦宪法法院在判决书里硬说德国共产党违背宪法，并且宣布要解散德国共产党和没收它的财产。它还宣布禁止“建立德国共产党的代替组织或者以现有的组织来作为代替的组织”。
    按照法院这个宣判，像自由德国青年联盟这样的群众组织也在取缔之列。而一些地方上的德国共产党议员也将被剥夺议席。
    在联邦宪法法院宣判以后，阿登纳政府立即出动大批警察去查封各地的德国共产党党部，没收德国共产党的财产和文件，封闭德国共产党的报纸。在汉堡，警察还逮捕了德国共产党的一些工作人员。
    阿登纳当局取缔德国共产党的横蛮措施激起了德国社会各阶层人士的强烈抗议。在西柏林，人民群众举行了许多抗议大会。在杜塞尔多夫的德国共产党总部树起了一面极大的红旗，总部的墙上也挂上一幅巨大的标语，上面写道：“尽管取缔，德国共产党还是继续存在下去。”
