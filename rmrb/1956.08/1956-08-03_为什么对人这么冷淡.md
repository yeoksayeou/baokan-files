　　Why Are People So Cold?
　　Li Bingning, Ren Junming

　　One hot summer afternoon, we happened to discover several young people who looked like students – unkempt, and reeking of sweat – in the archway of Zhengyangmen, across from the Beijing Qianmen Railway Station. The road next to the archway was being repaired for sewers. Piles of dirt and rocks were stacked in the archway. The opened sewers emitted bursts of foul odor. Some of these young people were lying asleep on the dirt and rubble, while others were diligently reading books with their heads down. Several bedrolls, backpacks, mouthwash cups, toothbrushes... and other items were placed beside them. They appeared to be people from out of town who had come to Beijing.

　　Who were they? Why did they come to Beijing? And why were they sleeping next to this foul-smelling ditch under renovation, making themselves so filthy?

　　It turned out that the admissions committees of various secondary specialized technical schools established by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau stipulated that the admissions committees were only responsible for registration and examination matters, and that out-of-town applicants were responsible for solving their own accommodation problems. As for whether out-of-town students could solve this problem themselves after arriving in Beijing, that was not within their scope of business!

　　On July 11th, Su Chao, a graduating student from Xuzhou Third Middle School in Jiangsu Province, came to Beijing to apply for the Water Conservancy School. He originally planned to stay at the school. The staff of the admissions committee coldly replied: out-of-town applicants are responsible for solving their own accommodation problems. As a result, this young student, who had no relatives or friends in the capital and no money to stay in a hotel, was left to wander the streets for two whole weeks.

　　Now listen to a conversation between a female student and a cadre from the admissions committee. Female student: Please help me solve the accommodation problem! Cadre: The higher authorities stipulate that out-of-town applicants are responsible for handling their own accommodation problems. Female student: To be honest, if this problem cannot be solved, I will have to sleep on the streets. Cadre: We don't care where you sleep, but you can't sleep here.

　　More and more candidates were sleeping outdoors; we interviewed thirteen of them. Therefore, the scope of outdoor sleeping expanded from the Zhengyangmen archway to the Qianmen archway, the small garden full of flowers and plants behind Qianmen, the railway station waiting room, and along the roadside of Qianmen Street where students were sleeping... When it rained, those who could hide in the archway were better off; those who could not find a spot in the archway had to run to the railway station waiting room or to the eaves of the police station next to the railway station.

　　While these young people were wandering the streets, more than 300 large, medium, and small schools in Beijing, with hundreds and thousands of buildings, were empty.

　　It seems that this issue needs to be brought to the attention of the admissions committee for reconsideration. We called the comrades of the admissions committee's secretariat to report this situation.

　　That same day, they told me that this situation had been reported to the director of the Education Bureau, and a decision had been made to solve this problem. They also asked us for the addresses of these students in detail.

　　However, regrettably, one day, two days, three days... passed, but the candidates were still sleeping on the streets.

　　Now the examination period is over, and the candidates have gradually left Beijing to return home, so this problem is considered "solved." But what deserves our deep reflection is: what a cold attitude towards people is hidden in the minds of these comrades!

　　Editor's Note: After receiving the article by comrades Li Bingning and Ren Junming, we verified the facts with Comrade Hu Qi, the secretary general of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau's Secondary Technical School Admissions Committee. According to him, the admissions committee had discussed the accommodation problem of out-of-town candidates at a meeting before registration. At that time, one comrade raised the following question: If out-of-town candidates live in the school, it's fine if they pass the exam; but if they fail, what if the students stay in the school and refuse to leave, demanding help with food, accommodation, and further education? To avoid this trouble, the meeting decided that out-of-town candidates would generally not be received. The editor asked how much factual basis the comrade who raised this question had, and whether many students who failed the exam had stayed at the school and refused to leave last year. Comrade Hu Qi initially said "not clear," and later said "heard of it." When the editor asked which schools had experienced such problems, Comrade Hu Qi said he didn't know. The editor then asked: When this meeting decided that out-of-town candidates would generally not be received, was consideration given to what the consequences of doing so would be, such as whether it would cause students from out of town to wander the streets in the scorching heat, suffering from illness, heatstroke, or even more serious accidents? Comrade Hu Qi frankly replied: "No consideration!" In fact, one candidate fainted as soon as he entered the gate of the Iron and Steel Industry School because he had nowhere to live (the school has taken responsibility for sending this student to the hospital).

　　At the beginning of registration, some schools not only did not solve the accommodation problem for out-of-town candidates themselves, but also raised objections to other schools that provided accommodation, because they were afraid that these schools would attract all the students and affect their school's enrollment.

　　After comrades Li Bingning and others raised their opinions to the admissions committee, it appeared that they had paid attention to the issue. They reported the situation to the higher authorities and notified all schools that if students had accommodation difficulties, the school they were applying to should be responsible for solving it, but no one went to settle down these students who had been sleeping on the streets for many days!

    为什么对人这么冷淡
    黎秉宁　任俊明
    这是一个炎热夏天的下午，我们偶然地在北京前门火车站对过、正阳门的城门洞内，发现了好几个蓬头垢面，身上散发着汗臭味，而貌似学生的年轻人。城门洞旁边的马路正在修理下水道。城门洞里堆了一堆堆的泥土石头。挖开了的下水道散发着一阵阵的臭味。这批年轻人有的就躺在泥土与乱石堆上睡着了，有的则正低着头用功地看书。他们身旁放着好几个铺盖卷、背包、漱口杯、牙刷……等东西。看来，似是外地到北京来的人。
    他们是谁？为什么来北京？又为什么睡到这正在翻修的臭水沟旁，弄得如此肮脏呢？
    原来是北京市教育局成立的各中等专业技术学校招生委员会规定：招生委员会只管报名、考试事宜，外埠前来投考学生，住宿问题一律自行解决。至于外埠学生抵京后是否都能自行解决这个问题，那就不在他们的业务范围内了！
    七月十一日，江苏省徐州市第三中学的应届毕业生苏超，来北京投考水利学校。他原打算借住在学校里。招生委员会的工作人冷淡的回答：外来投考学生，住宿问题一律自行解决。于是这位在首都举目无亲，又没钱住旅店的年轻学生就在街头流浪了整整两星期。
    再请听一位女学生和招生委员会的干部的对话。女学生：请替我解决一下住宿问题吧！干部：上级规定，外来考生，住宿问题自行处理。女学生：坦白说，这问题如果不能解决，我就只好露宿在街头了。干部：你睡到那里，我们不管，可就不能睡在这里。
    露宿考生越来越多，我们访问过的就有十三个。因此露宿范围也就从正阳门城门洞扩大到前门城门洞，前门后面种满了花草的小花园、火车站候车室以及沿着前门大街的马路边上也都睡了学生……。遇到下雨，躲在城门洞内的还好，没在洞内占上位置的只好跑到火车站候车室或者跑到火车站旁边的派出所的屋檐下去。
    就在这群年轻人流浪街头的时候，北京市三百多所大、中、小学，成百、成千幢房子却在空着。
    看来这问题需要提请招生委员会重新考虑。我们打电话给招生委员会秘书组的同志反映了这个情况。
    当天，他们就告诉我这个情况已向教育局局长反映了，已作出决定，解决这一问题。而且还详细地向我们询问这批学生的地址。
    可是，很遗憾，一天、二天、三天……过去了，考生们却仍然是露宿在街头。
    现在考期已经过了，考生们已经陆续离京回家，这个问题也就算是“解决”了。但值得我们深思的是：隐藏在这些同志们的脑子中，是多么冷淡的对人的态度啊！
    编者附记：在收到黎秉宁、任俊明同志的文章后，我们曾向北京市教育局中等技术学校招生委员会秘书组长胡奇同志核对事实。据他说，招生委员会在报名前曾经在一次会议上研究过外地考生的住宿问题。当时一位同志却提出这样一个问题：外地考生们住在学校，考取了还好；要是考不取，学生们住在学校不走，要求帮助解决吃饭、住宿、升学问题，那怎么办？为了避免这个麻烦，会议就确定：外地考生一般不予接待。编者曾经询问提这个问题的同志有多少事实根据，是不是去年有很多考不取的学生赖在学校不走？胡奇同志开始说“不清楚”，后来说“听说有过”。编者再问究竟哪些学校发生过这样的问题，胡奇同志又说不知道。编者又问：当这次会议确定外地考生一般不予接待时，是不是考虑到这样做会有什么样的后果，比如会不会让外地来的学生在酷暑中流浪街头，发生疾病、中暑甚至更严重的意外？胡奇同志很爽直的回答说：“没有考虑！”而事实上就有一个考生因为无处可住弄得一进钢铁工业学校的门就昏倒在地（该校已负责把这个学生送进医院）。
    在开始报名时，有的学校不但自己不为外来的考生解决住宿问题，而且对别的招待住宿的学校提出了反对的意见，原因是怕这些学校因此把学生都拉走，影响他们学校的招生。
    当黎秉宁等同志向招生委员会提出意见以后，从表面看来，他们已重视这个问题，他们向上级反映了情况，也通知了各校如果学生住宿有困难，报考学校应该负责解决，可就是没有人去安置一下这些已经露宿街头多日的学生！
