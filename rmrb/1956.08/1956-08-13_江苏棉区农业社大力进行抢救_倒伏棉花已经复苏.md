Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 12th: Cotton fields in Jiangsu Province, which were hit by the typhoon, have undergone vigorous rescue efforts. The lodged cotton has recovered, and growth is showing signs of improvement.

After the typhoon stopped, many agricultural production cooperatives in the cotton-growing areas held symposiums on cotton planting experience to study ways to rescue the damaged cotton seedlings. Members with cotton planting experience believe that there are more than two months before the first frost, which is enough time to strive for a bumper cotton harvest. Members of agricultural cooperatives in the Nantong Special Zone seized the favorable opportunity when the soil around the roots of the cotton plants was still wet after the rain, and in conjunction with earthing up and soil consolidation, helped up the lodged cotton plants one by one, gently tamping the soil firmly. At present, the earthing up work in the cotton fields of this special zone has been basically completed, and fertilizers have been generally applied, and the cotton growth situation has improved. Members of agricultural cooperatives in the Yancheng Special Zone, especially in the key cotton-producing areas of Yancheng, Dafeng, and Sheyang counties, are earthing up, consolidating soil, supporting plants, weeding, and applying fertilizer to more than 900,000 mu of cotton fields that have been severely affected by the typhoon. More than 400,000 mu have been fertilized throughout the special zone.

    江苏棉区农业社大力进行抢救
    倒伏棉花已经复苏
    据新华社南京12日电　江苏省遭台风袭击受灾的棉田经过大力抢救，倒伏的棉花已经复苏，生长日有起色。
    棉区很多农业生产合作社在台风停止后召开了植棉经验座谈会，研究抢救受害棉苗的办法。有植棉经验的社员们认为现在离霜降有两个多月，争取棉花丰收有足够时间。南通专区各个农业社社员抓紧雨后棉棵根部未干的有利时机，结合壅根、培土，把倒伏棉棵一一扶起，轻轻把土踏实。目前这个专区棉田壅土工作已经基本完成，并普遍追施了肥料，棉花生长情况好转。盐城专区重点产棉地区的盐城、大丰和射阳等县农业社社员正在受台风灾害严重的九十多万亩棉田里壅根、培土、扶棵、除草和追肥。全专区已追肥四十多万亩。
