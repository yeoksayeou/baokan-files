Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 8th: In the fields of Zhejiang Province, which was hit by a strong typhoon, a busy scene of rushing to harvest, rushing to plant, and protecting seedlings is unfolding to restore production. The broad masses of farmers are striving for a bumper late autumn harvest to make up for the losses caused by the disaster.

Due to the strong winds and torrential rains, various crops in Zhejiang Province have suffered damage to varying degrees. Of the one million mu of early rice in the province that has not yet been harvested, approximately three million mu of single-season middle rice that is growing has experienced lodging, grain shattering, and germination. The young leaves of the double-cropping late rice seedlings, which were only recently transplanted, have had many broken off, and many of those that have not yet turned green have floated up due to their roots not being firmly established. Many corn and sweet potatoes have also been blown down or had their leaves stripped off, and in severe cases, the stems and vines have also been broken. In the main cotton-producing counties of Cixi, Yuyao, Zhenhai, Shangyu, and Xiaoshan, where 1.1 million mu of cotton is in full bloom, many cotton bolls have been blown off, and most of the cotton plants have been blown down.

After the typhoon and rainstorm, all localities immediately arranged for the resettlement of disaster victims and rescue work, and universally adopted measures to restore production. The leading organs of the Jiaxing Special District are leading farmers to vigorously repair the seawalls in counties such as Haiyan, Pinghu, and Haining, while also rushing to harvest 400,000 mu of early rice, which is expected to be completed soon. Under the slogan of "Seizing Grain from Time," the members of the Daqing Township Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County rushed to harvest early rice, rush to plant late rice, and support lodged corn on a total of 570 mu in one day. After support, nursing, and fertilization, the 500,000+ mu of cotton in Cixi County still has the hope of a bumper harvest. In the most severely affected counties of Xiangshan and Yuhang, where some crops have failed, farmers are actively preparing to replant autumn miscellaneous grain crops in an effort to recover the losses caused by the disaster.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 8th: Zhejiang Province is rapidly carrying out the work of repairing the water conservancy projects damaged by the strong typhoon, in order to prepare for overcoming the upcoming high tides.

When Zhejiang Province was hit by the strong typhoon, some areas experienced partial collapse and breaches of seawalls and river embankments due to the strong winds and heavy rain. After the intense rescue efforts, the people in these areas immediately devoted themselves to repair work. The people of Pinghu, Haining, Haiyan, and other counties in the northern coastal area are rushing to repair the seawalls. Near Hangzhou City in the lower reaches of the Qiantang River, more than 10,000 farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and residents are rushing to repair the outer embankments, and have basically filled the breaches and begun to raise some sections of the embankments.

The province-wide seawall and river embankment repair project is expected to be completed before the major flood season in the eighth month of the lunar calendar.

    弥补台风灾害带来的损失
    浙江力争晚秋作物丰收
    全省海塘江堤修复工程预计大汛前完成
    据新华社杭州8日电　在受到强台风袭击的浙江省田野上，呈现着抢收、抢种和保苗等恢复生产的繁忙景象。广大农民正在力争晚秋作物丰收，以弥补灾害带来的损失。
    由于风力强大，并且带来暴雨，浙江省各种农作物也受到了不同程度的损害。全省尚未收割的一百万亩早稻，正在生长的单季中稻也有约三百万亩，发生倒伏、落粒和发芽现象。不久前才插下去的双季连作晚稻秧苗，已转青的幼叶被吹断不少，未转青的因根没有扎牢而浮起的也很多。玉米、甘薯也有不少被吹倒或刮掉叶子，部分严重的茎、藤也折断了。主要产棉区慈溪、余姚、镇海、上虞、萧山等县的一百十万亩棉花正值开花旺期，不少棉铃被风吹落，大部棉株被吹倒。
    各地在台风暴雨后，紧接着安置灾民和抢险工作，普遍采取恢复生产的措施。嘉兴专区的领导机关领导农民一面大力抢修海盐、平湖、海宁等县的海塘，一面突击抢收四十万亩早稻，不日即可抢收完毕。富阳县大青乡的农业社社员在“与时争粮”的口号下，一天内就抢收早稻、抢种晚稻和扶理倒伏的玉米共五百七十亩。慈溪县五十多万亩棉花经过扶植、护理和施肥后，仍有丰收希望。受灾最重的象山、余杭等县有些农作物失收，农民正在积极准备改种秋杂粮作物，争取挽回灾害带来的损失。
    据新华社杭州8日电　浙江省迅速展开修复被强台风破坏的水利工程的工作，为战胜即将到来的潮汛作好准备。
    当浙江省遭到强台风的袭击时，有些地区由于风猛雨大，海塘、江堤部分倒塌和决口。这些地区的人民在紧张抢险以后，立即投入了修复工作。北部沿海的平湖、海宁、海盐等县人民正在抢修海塘。钱塘江下游杭州市附近有一万多农民、人民解放军、居民抢修外堤，已经把决口基本填好，并且开始加高部分堤段。
    全省海塘、江堤的修复工程预计在夏历八月大汛前完成。
