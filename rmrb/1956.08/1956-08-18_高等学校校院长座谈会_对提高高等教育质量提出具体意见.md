Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The summer symposium of university presidents and academic affairs directors, which concluded on the 16th, put forward many suggestions from a positive perspective for overcoming the current excessive study burden on students, strengthening the cultivation of students' independent working abilities, and improving the quality of higher education.

The symposium believed that the current situation of excessive course categories and class hours in the teaching plan must be appropriately changed. The less important courses and class hours in the current teaching plan should be appropriately reduced to increase students' extracurricular self-study time. However, experimental classes, production internships, and other teaching elements that play an important role in cultivating students' independent working abilities should not only not be reduced but should also be improved and gradually strengthened. The quality of exercise classes and classroom discussions should be focused on improving, and class hours can be reduced. After the changes, the weekly study hours stipulated in the teaching plan can generally be reduced by two to three hours. Schools can also make necessary changes to the order of each course, the class hours of some teaching elements, and the number of courses examined each semester, based on specific circumstances.

The symposium believed that the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" should be correctly implemented in higher education teaching. The teaching syllabus for each course formulated by the Ministry of Higher Education is a guiding teaching document that implements the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism and also reflects the requirements for cultivating talents who meet certain specifications. However, teachers are allowed to be flexible when conducting teaching. Different schools of thought in a certain subject can formulate different syllabuses based on the above guidance; teachers can also express personal opinions and theories, and when necessary, teachers can also set up special lectures and give academic reports to express personal academic opinions. The symposium believed that this is more conducive to inspiring students' independent thinking and the cultivation of independent working abilities.

The symposium believed that improving and strengthening teaching methodology is one of the important keys to improving teaching quality, especially the quality of lectures. At present, special emphasis should be placed on overcoming the tendency of dogmatism in teaching methodology and implementing the teaching policy of integrating theory with practice. In terms of teaching content, the situation of trying to swallow more than one can chew should be avoided. The breadth and depth of the teaching syllabus should be appropriately grasped based on factors such as the nature of the course, the scientific system of the course, the lecture hours, and the needs of the major. Various teaching elements should overcome the shortcomings of teachers taking care of students everywhere, while students rely too much on teachers and lack independent self-study; at the same time, it is necessary to proceed from the existing foundation of students, give full play to the leading role of teachers, and strengthen guidance on students' extracurricular self-study work, to prevent the bias of liberalistic teaching in higher education.

In order to reduce the excessive burden on students, the symposium believed that it should also be clarified that the central task of higher education is to cultivate specialized talents, so it is necessary to correctly implement the policy of all-round development and teaching students according to their aptitude. Attention should be paid to students' original level and individual differences. Average requirements and uniformity should not be imposed. Students' extracurricular activities should not be excessive and should be appropriately implemented according to the principle of voluntariness. At the same time, students' living and self-study conditions should also be improved as much as possible.

### 高等学校校院长座谈会  对提高高等教育质量提出具体意见

    高等学校校院长座谈会
    对提高高等教育质量提出具体意见
    新华社16日讯　十六日结束的暑期高等学校校院长和教务长座谈会，对于目前克服学生学习负担过重，加强培养学生的独立工作能力，提高高等教育质量，从积极方面提出了许多意见。
    座谈会认为，现行教学计划的课程门类和上课时数过多的情况必须适当改变。对于现行教学计划中一些次要的课程和上课时数，要适当减少，以增加学生的课外自习时间。但是，实验课、生产实习等对培养学生独立工作能力起重要作用的教学环节，则不仅不减少，还要改进和逐步加强。习题课和课堂讨论目前应该着重提高质量，时数可以减少。经过变动，教学计划所规定的周学时一般可以减少二到三个学时。学校还可以根据具体情况对每门课程的顺序、有些教学环节的时数和各学期考试课程的门数作必要的变动。
    座谈会认为，高等学校教学中应正确贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针。高等教育部制定的各门课程的教学大纲是指导性的教学文件，贯彻了马克思列宁主义的指导思想，也体现了培养合乎一定规格的人才的要求。但是，允许教师在进行教学时有灵活性。某门学科的不同学派可以根据上述的指导性制定不同的大纲；教师也可以发表个人的见解和学说，必要时还可以让教师设专门讲座和作学术报告来发挥个人的学术见解。座谈会认为，这样更有助于启发学生的独立思考和独立工作能力的培养。
    座谈会认为，改进和加强教学法工作是提高教学质量，特别是讲课质量的重要关键之一。目前应该特别着重克服教学法工作中的教条主义的倾向，贯彻理论联系实际的教学方针。在教学内容方面，应该避免贪多嚼不烂的情况，根据课程性质、本门课程的科学系统、讲授时数和专业的需要等因素，恰当地掌握教学大纲的广度和深度。各种教学环节要克服教师处处照顾学生，而学生依赖教师多，独立自学少的缺点；同时，又要从学生的现有基础出发，发挥教师的主导作用，对学生的课外自学工作加强指导，防止发生高等教育的自由主义教学的偏向。
    为了减轻学生的过重负担，座谈会认为还应该明确，高等学校教育是以培养专门人才为中心任务的，所以要正确贯彻全面发展，因才施教的方针。要注意学生的原有水平和个性差异，不应该平均要求，强求一律。学生的课外活动不应过多，并且要适当贯彻自愿的原则。同时，对学生的生活和自学条件也应该尽可能的改善。
