How to Safely Use the Pesticide "1605"
Zhu Xianli

"1605" is a new type of insecticide, characterized by: small dosage, great effectiveness, and a wide range of insect control.

To treat cotton aphids and red spiders with "1605", the concentration is six parts per hundred thousand. Taking the currently promoted 46.6% "1605" as an example, it is diluted 16,000 times, which means one tael of the original solution is added to 1,000 jin of water. One tael of the original solution costs a little over one yuan, and after adding 1,000 jin of water, it can be used to kill insects on five to ten mu of land. This is cheaper than using any other pesticide.

"1605" is very effective and can completely eliminate cotton aphids and red spiders. This is because it has three insecticidal actions: stomach poison, contact, and fumigation. Stomach poison means that after pests eat the medicine, it is absorbed by the intestinal wall, causing poisoning. Contact action means that after the medicine touches the pest's body, it penetrates the body through the epidermis and causes poisoning. Fumigation action means that part of the medicine evaporates into vapor at high temperatures, enters the pest's body through the spiracles with breathing, and causes poisoning.

"1605" not only kills pests but also has severe toxicity to higher animals. A person can die from licking a little of the original solution. Skin contact with the liquid, or inhaling too much of the fine mist of the liquid while breathing, can cause poisoning.

The reason why "1605" can cause poisoning in higher animals can be simply explained as follows: The blood and tissues of all animals contain two substances: one is called acetylcholine, whose function is to stimulate nerve impulses. We cannot do without it when we raise our hands, move our feet, drool, or sweat. The other is called cholinesterase, whose function is to inhibit acetylcholine and prevent its effect from being too great. After "1605" enters an animal's body, it combines with cholinesterase, and cholinesterase loses its function. The excitatory effect of acetylcholine is not restricted, and it endlessly stimulates the impulses of motor nerves, causing the activities of muscles and glands to lose their normal state. A person poisoned by "1605" cannot stop urinating, which is the result of excessive excitement of the bladder sphincter. Profuse sweating is the result of excessive excitement of the sweat glands. The heart, liver, and internal organs of a poisoned person are all in a state of extreme excitement. As a result of excessive excitement, the person dies.

When "1605" was first promoted two years ago, some accidents involving human and animal poisoning occurred because the publicity was insufficient, so some people were very afraid of it. This year, many regions also have this situation, because they are afraid of poisoning, they dare not use this medicine.

"1605" is highly toxic, and there have been accidents involving human and animal poisoning; but we must not stop using it because of this. Electricity can be used for lighting and to power machines, but it can also electrocute people to death; we cannot stop using electricity because of this. "1605" poisoning is like electric shock, an accidental accident; as long as you know how to use it safely, there will be no danger.

The principle of safe use of "1605" is to prevent the human body from coming into contact with the liquid. Therefore, before spraying, check the sprayer; when spraying, protect all parts of the body; after spraying, take a bath with soap and change clothes, and wash the removed clothes with soap. In short, it must be used in strict accordance with the "Methods for Safe Use of 1605 and 1059" already promulgated by the agricultural departments. (Note: The "1605" mentioned in this article is "E605".)

    怎样安全使用农药“1605”
    朱先立
    “1605”是一种新兴的杀虫药剂，它的特点是：用量少，效力大，治虫的范围广泛。
    用“1605”治棉蚜和红蜘蛛，浓度是十万分之六，拿现在推广的46.6％“1605”来说，是兑水一万六千倍，也就是一两原液加水一千斤。一两原液合一块多钱，加水一千斤后，能供五亩到十亩地杀虫之用。这比用什么药都便宜。
    “1605”效力大，对棉蚜和红蜘蛛能收到彻底除治的效果。这是因为它同时具备有胃毒、接触、熏蒸三种杀虫作用。胃毒作用，是害虫吃了药以后，被肠壁吸收，因而中毒；接触作用，是药沾到害虫身体上以后，通过表皮，渗透到体内发生毒杀作用；熏蒸作用，是药在高温下一部分挥发成蒸气，从害虫气孔随呼吸进入体内后引起中毒。
    “1605”不但能毒死害虫，对高等动物也有剧烈毒害。人只要舔一点原液，就能丧命；皮肤上沾上药液，或呼吸时吸入过多的药液细雾，都能中毒。
    “1605”能使高等动物中毒的原因，简单说来是这样：一切动物的血液和组织里都含有两种物质，一种叫乙醯胆碱，它的作用是刺激神经冲动，我们抬手、动脚、流涎、出汗，都离不了它；一种叫胆碱脂酶，它的作用是抑制乙醯胆碱，使它的作用不要太大。“1605”进入动物体内以后，就和胆碱脂酶结合起来，胆碱脂酶就失去作用。乙醯胆碱的兴奋作用受不到限制，就无休止地刺激冲动运动神经，肌肉腺体的活动就失去常态。“1605”中毒的人流尿不止，就是膀胱括约肌过度兴奋的结果；大汗如雨，就是汗腺过度兴奋的结果。中毒的人的心、肝、五脏无一不在极度兴奋状态中。过度兴奋的结果，人就死了。
    前两年刚推广“1605”的时候，因为宣传工作作得不够，曾发生过一些人畜中毒的事故，于是有些人非常怕它。今年有不少地区也有这样的情况，因为怕中毒，就不敢用这种药了。
    “1605”有剧毒，并且发生过人畜中毒的事故；但是绝不能因此就不用它了。电能照明，能开动机器，可是也能使人触电而死；我们不能因此就不用电。“1605”中毒和触电一样，是意外的事故；只要懂得怎样安全使用，就不会发生危险。
    “1605”安全使用的原则，是不使人体沾染药液。因此，喷药前，要检查喷雾器；喷射时，要防护好身体的各部分；喷完药，要用肥皂洗澡，更换衣服，换下的衣服，用肥皂洗净。总之必须切实按照农业部门已经颁发的“安全使用1605和1059的办法”使用。（按：这篇文章中说的“1605”就是“E605”。）
