Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government today instructed Shigemitsu, the plenipotentiary representative to the negotiations with the Soviet Union and the Japanese Foreign Minister, to return to Japan directly as soon as possible and not to go to the United States. Shigemitsu is currently in London, representing the Japanese government at the Suez Canal Conference.

The Japanese government also instructed other members of the Japanese delegation attending the Soviet-Japanese negotiations to remain in Moscow until the government makes a final decision.

The Japanese government issued this instruction today because it received a telegram today from Shinji Yoshino, the Minister of Transport who is also attending the London Conference. The telegram stated that Shigemitsu intended to return to Japan with him via the United States.

The Soviet-Japanese negotiations were interrupted last week due to Japan's insistence on unreasonable territorial demands. The Japanese government and the ruling party are hesitant and undecided due to internal differences. Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama has expressed his willingness to go to Moscow in person to break the deadlock in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, but the cabinet decided to wait until Shigemitsu returns home before making a decision.

Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu told reporters in London today: "The government wants me not to go to the United States and to return home directly; but I will still depart on August 28th according to the planned schedule, and return home via the United States." Shigemitsu also said: "Before returning home, I may have another meeting with US Secretary of State Dulles."

    日本政府训令重光直接回日本不要赴美
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天训令同苏联谈判的全权代表、日本外务相重光尽快直接回国而不要到美国去，重光现在在伦敦，代表日本政府参加苏彝士运河会议。
    日本政府同时训令出席苏日谈判的日本代表团其他人员在政府未作出最后决定以前继续留在莫斯科。
    日本政府今天发出这个训令是因为今天收到了另一个出席伦敦会议的运输相吉野信次的一封电报。电报说，重光要和他一起取道美国回日本。
    苏日谈判由于日本坚持无理的领土要求在上星期中断后，日本政府和执政党由于内部分歧正在躇踌不决。日本首相鸠山一郎，已经表示愿意亲自到莫斯科去打开苏日谈判僵局，但是内阁决定等重光回国后再作决定。
    日本外务相重光今天在伦敦向记者说：“政府要我不要取道美国，直接回国；但是我还要按照预定计划在八月二十八日动身，取道美国回国。”重光并且说：“我在回国以前，也许还要同美国国务卿杜勒斯再会谈一次”。
