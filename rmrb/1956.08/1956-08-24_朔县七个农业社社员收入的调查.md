    Investigation of Income of Members of Seven Agricultural Cooperatives in Shuoxian County
    Shuoxian County Work Group, Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Editor's Note: How many cooperative members can be guaranteed an increase in income in the first year of advanced agricultural production cooperatives? This is a question of concern to everyone. According to this survey material, the issue is very complex. Some large-scale advanced cooperatives include several villages and townships, where the various villages with different economic foundations, especially the specific situations of new and old cooperative members, will experience many changes in actual income during this year's autumn harvest distribution. For example, the old cooperative members of the Nanguan Cooperative earned a lot last year, but this year 36.7% of the farmers will experience a decrease in income, which is a very noteworthy issue. It is hoped that all localities will conduct surveys on the income of cooperative members, seize this period before the autumn harvest, and take all effective measures to strive for more cooperative members to increase their income.

    In 1955, only 25.6% of the farmers in the Yanbei area of Shanxi Province were in elementary cooperatives. This spring, during the cooperativization movement, farmers joining advanced cooperatives accounted for 94.7% of the total number of farmers. During the rapid development, the phenomenon of several villages forming one cooperative and several cooperatives merging into one was very common. New cooperative members accounted for more than 70% of the total number of cooperative members. What problems will these situations reflect in the first year of advanced cooperativization's autumn harvest distribution? This is something we need to consider as early as possible. In order to understand this situation, we conducted a survey and study of seven typical cooperatives in Shuoxian County. The situation of the seven cooperatives is as follows: Zhangjiahe Red Star Cooperative is an old cooperative and also an advanced cooperative, with old cooperative members accounting for 70%. It is a large cooperative formed by the merger of four natural villages and four old cooperatives. Dongfuyuan and Mixi Mazhuang Cooperatives are "leap-forward" cooperatives (advanced cooperatives directly established by mutual aid teams and individual farmers). Dongfuyuan Cooperative is also a cooperative jointly run by two villages. Dongguan, Xiguan, Nanguan, and Zhujiazhuang Cooperatives are all based on old cooperatives and have developed a large number of new cooperative members into large cooperatives. Now, let's discuss the surveyed issues separately:

    I. How Much Production Increase
    After Zhangjiahe and the other seven cooperatives upgraded to advanced cooperatives, they adopted the following eight measures to increase production:

    First, in terms of water conservancy construction, the seven cooperatives originally had an average of 0.5 mu of clear water land per person. After water conservancy projects were built, there is now an average of 1.45 mu per person. The original flood irrigation land was 5,370 mu, and 8,738 mu were newly expanded. Second, in terms of increasing the application of base fertilizer, the fertilizer application area of the seven cooperatives last year accounted for 60% of the total cultivated land area, which increased to 84% this year. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from 1,100 jin last year to 1,978 jin. Third, the planting area of high-yield crops, mainly corn, has been expanded. The seven cooperatives collectively trial-planted 158 mu of corn last year, and expanded it to 5,321 mu this year. Fourth, intercropping and interplanting (referring to interplanting other crops before the wheat harvest) have been promoted. Last year, a total of 1,700 mu were intercropped and interplanted, and this year it was expanded to 6,521 mu, accounting for 16.8% of the area of grain crop fields. Fifth, rational close planting was implemented, with close planting area accounting for 49% of the total cultivated land area. Sixth, this area historically had no habit of applying top dressing fertilizer. This year, the planned top dressing fertilizer area accounts for 21% of the total cultivated land area. Seventh, 900 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Eighth, an average of more than seven workdays per mu were used, an increase of three over the past. Other technologies such as the promotion of improved seeds and deep plowing have also been improved.

    The combined effect of the above eight production increase measures is estimated to increase the average yield per mu by 78 jin. If this is used as the production increase standard, it is 65% higher than the seven cooperatives' "three-fix" average yield of 120 jin per mu, and 76% higher than the actual yield of 102.625 jin per mu last year.

    When reviewing and revising the 1956 production plan, the seven cooperatives finally planned an average target of 175.75 jin per mu.

    The specific situation of the seven cooperatives after revising the plan can be roughly divided into three categories: Dongguan, Zhujiazhuang, and Nanguan cooperatives have good land, with a yield of 185 jin to 209 jin per mu. The land of Xiguan and Zhangjiahe cooperatives is slightly worse, with a yield of 178 jin to 179 jin per mu. The land of Mixi Mazhuang and Dongfuyuan cooperatives is even worse, with a yield of 118 jin to 131 jin per mu. Although the production increase plan for sideline occupations has also been revised, the potential for sideline production has not been sufficiently tapped.

    II. Trial Calculation of Distribution Results
    From the overall situation of the seven cooperatives, the total income of the seven cooperatives in 1956 was 1,059,604 yuan, of which agricultural income accounted for 90.15% and sideline income accounted for 9.85%, an increase of 56.4% compared with the total income in 1955. Zhangjiahe increased the most, at 101%; Nanguan increased the least, at 18.4%; the other five cooperatives increased by 32% to 82%.

    The various expenses are as follows: state taxes, public grain, and sideline taxes account for 7.75% of the total income. Zhujiazhuang is the highest, at 9.5%, Xiguan is the lowest, at 5.6%, and the other five cooperatives are 6% to 7%.

    The public accumulation fund and public welfare fund retained by the cooperative account for 6.4% of the total income. Zhangjiahe is the highest, at 9.5%, Mixi Mazhuang is the lowest, at 2.1%, and the other five cooperatives are around 6%.

    Management fees account for 0.48% of the total income. Zhujiazhuang is the highest, at 0.64%, and Zhangjiahe is the lowest, at 0.24%.

    The current year's production investment accounts for 21.46% of the total income. Mixi Mazhuang is the highest, accounting for 25%, and Dongfuyuan is the lowest, accounting for 13.6%.

    The above four expenses of the seven cooperatives account for 36.1% of the total income, and the net personal income of the cooperative members accounts for 63.9% of the total income. A total of more than 677,000 yuan, an increase of 53.16% compared with 1955. Zhangjiahe increased the most, at 105%, and Nanguan increased the least, at 4%.

    According to trial calculations, there are a total of 2,489 households in the seven cooperatives, with 2,148 households increasing their income compared to last year, accounting for 86.3% of the total number of households. 238 households experienced a decrease in income, accounting for 9.6% of the total number of households, and 103 households were not calculated (households with reduced labor and "five guarantees" households), accounting for 4.1% of the total number of households. Nanguan Cooperative has the most households with decreased income, accounting for 36.7% of the total number of households. Zhangjiahe Cooperative has the fewest households with decreased income, accounting for 1.7%. Dongfuyuan Cooperative has households with decreased income accounting for 13.4%, and the other four cooperatives have households with decreased income accounting for more than 4% and less than 9%.

    Among the households with increased income, those with an increase of less than 50% compared to last year account for 41.2% of the households with increased income; those with an increase of more than 50% and less than two times account for 48.3%; and those with an increase of more than two times account for slightly over 10%.

    Among the households with decreased income, those with a decrease of less than 50% compared to last year account for 63% of the households with decreased income, and those with a decrease of more than 50% account for 37% of the households with decreased income.

    There are three reasons for the decrease in income of households with decreased income: ① Last year, some households engaged in sideline occupations with rubber-tired carts and large carts or grew vegetable gardens, resulting in large incomes. After joining the advanced cooperative, these incomes were lost, resulting in a decrease in income for 84 households. Most of these households were upper-middle peasants and rich peasants, and a small number were middle peasants. ② 66 households experienced a decrease in income due to having more land, better land, and livestock. Most of these households were upper-middle peasants. ③ 88 households experienced a decrease in income due to weak labor, illness, and fewer workdays. Most of these households were poor peasants and lower-middle peasants.

    Among these households with decreased income, the largest decrease in income was experienced by upper-middle peasants and rich peasants. According to a survey of 20 households (131 people) of upper-middle peasants and rich peasants in Dongguan, Nanguan, and Dongfuyuan cooperatives, their average net income per person in 1955 was 106 yuan, and the estimated average net income per person in 1956 is 57 yuan. Compared over the two years, the income has decreased by almost half.

    According to a survey of forty households (120 people) of poor peasants with decreased income in Zhangjiahe and other cooperatives, the estimated average net income per person this year is only 24.5 yuan.

    Looking at the seven cooperatives separately: Zhujiazhuang and Mixi Mazhuang cooperatives suffered from disasters last year and had low incomes, so this year's income is much higher than last year's. At the same time, the income of various types of cooperative members was relatively balanced last year. Trial calculations show that more than 90% of households have guaranteed an increase in income.

    Zhangjiahe, Dongguan, and Xiguan cooperatives have a considerable proportion of economic crops or sideline production. However, the income base last year varied greatly. For example, in the four old cooperatives of Zhangjiahe, the average net income per cooperative member in the original Zhangjiahe Cooperative was 62 yuan, while the average net income per member in the other three cooperatives was around 40 yuan. Another example is that the average net income per old cooperative member in Dongguan was 61.7 yuan, while the average net income per new cooperative member was 41.8 yuan. This disparity means that, for this year's distribution, if there is no significant increase in production and net income, it will be difficult to achieve a 90% increase in income for cooperative member households.

    Dongfuyuan Cooperative is a "leap-forward" cooperative. Land reform here was not thorough, and it has long been a backward village. Upper-middle peasants and rich peasants account for about 8% of the total number of households. Moreover, the merger of two villages into one cooperative has different conditions. One village has more and better land, while the other village has less land and more labor. Sideline production and economic crop planting are extremely rare. Trial calculations show that 13.4% of households experienced a decrease in income.

    Nanguan Cooperative has good land, and income from sideline occupations and economic crops accounts for 36.5% of the total income. However, due to planting 600 mu less of Chinese yams this year than last year, income decreased by 10,000 yuan. The brick kiln industry and other sideline occupations have stalled, resulting in a decrease in income of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Old cooperative members had high incomes last year, and trial calculations show that 36.7% of households experienced a decrease in income. There are 69 old cooperative member households, and 42 households experienced a decrease in income, accounting for 60% of the old cooperative members.

    III. Several Problems Seen from the Distribution Trial Calculation

    First, whether production can be increased and how many cooperative members can increase their income are the central issues of concern in the investigation. From the survey materials, the income changes of cooperative members in the first year of advanced cooperativization are significant in these complex and specific situations: several villages form one cooperative, and the conditions of each village are different; several cooperatives merge into one cooperative, and the income bases are different; old cooperatives expand, and the income situations of new and old cooperative members are different. To ensure that the income of cooperative members with a high income base last year can also not be lower than last year, and to achieve an increase in income for 90% of cooperative member households, it is impossible to do so with only a general increase in production without a significant increase in production.

    Second, can an increase in production guarantee an increase in income? The key lies in correctly handling the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and the individual cooperative members during distribution. The seven cooperatives tightly grasped this point in the distribution trial calculation and used ensuring that cooperative members can share more than 60% of the total income as the standard. According to the trial calculation results of the seven cooperatives, the share received by cooperative members is generally around 64% to 65%. The lowest is also 61%. Another key issue in guaranteeing an increase in income is whether the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily can be implemented. The seven cooperatives originally planned that the current year's production investment would account for 30.9% of the total income. After a line-by-line inspection during the investigation, expenses were compressed and reduced to 21.94% of the total income, saving a total of 90,022 yuan. This directly guaranteed the proportion of profits distributed to cooperative members.

    Third, due to the imbalance in the income base between cooperatives, between villages, and between new and old cooperative members, the increase in income this year also varies greatly. Generally, those with a high income base originally have a smaller increase in income this year, and even experience a decrease in income. Overcoming this imbalance is not easy. In addition to actively expanding production channels and striving to increase production, we must find ways to increase the income of households with a high income base last year but a small increase in income this year, and pay attention to strengthening ideological education to alleviate contradictions.

    IV. Several Tasks That Must Be Done Well

    First, after realizing advanced cooperativization, we should make full use of the superiority of collective production to make the best use of everyone's talents and improve labor efficiency. According to an inspection of the seven cooperatives, the problems in labor management in the half-year period before April 30 were significant. According to normal calculations, 173,820 workdays should have been completed, but they only completed 93,380 workdays. In addition, the labor quotas were not formulated reasonably. For example, no distinction was made between the distance of the land, the quality of the cattle, and the difficulty of the work, which directly affected the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. Although the cooperatives have inspected these problems and arranged outlets for the surplus labor force, formulated management methods for field production teams, and revised the labor quotas, they should continue to pay attention to continuous improvement in the future.

    Second, establish a comprehensive production viewpoint and make a good comprehensive production plan. The common biases of the seven cooperatives, except for individual cooperatives, are two: they only pay attention to agricultural production and neglect sideline production; they only pay attention to grain crop production and neglect economic crop production. The sideline production of the seven cooperatives is poor in the other four cooperatives except for Dongguan, Xiguan, and Nanguan. The sideline income of Zhangjiahe Cooperative accounts for only 1.84% of the total income (with more economic crops). Dongguan Cooperative has an average total income of 109 yuan per person due to its emphasis on sideline occupations and economic crop production. These situations raise an important issue for us, namely, we must make sideline production plans and develop economic crop planting plans in light of local conditions to comprehensively develop production.

    Third, the seven cooperatives have serious shortcomings in organizing the household sideline production of cooperative members. They even take many wrong measures to restrict cooperative members from engaging in household sideline production. For example, they have not stipulated the labor time of cooperative members in the cooperative and the labor time at home, and simply emphasize labor in the cooperative; they allocate small plots of vegetable land that should be allocated to cooperative members to remote and bad land. Zhangjiahe Cooperative takes the method of changing the private plots every year for fear that cooperative members will apply more fertilizer and process more to the private plots. Because of too many restrictions, the number of pigs and chickens raised by cooperative members has decreased year by year. This situation should not be allowed to continue.

    Fourth, it is still an issue that must be emphasized in the minds of cooperative cadres and in specific work to implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, do a good job in financial management, and overcome extravagance and waste in financial expenditures. Although the seven cooperatives have not experienced serious waste, there are still some wasteful phenomena that have not attracted people's attention.

    朔县七个农业社社员收入的调查
    中共雁北地委朔县工作组
    编者按　在高级农业生产合作社第一年的分配中，究竟能够保证多少社员增加收入？这是大家所关心的问题。根据这个调查材料来看，问题是很复杂的。有些大型的高级社包括几个村、乡，其中各个经济基础不同的村庄，特别是具体情况不同的新老社员，在今年秋收分配的时候，实际收入会发生很多变化。例如南关合作社的老社员去年收入很多，今年有36.7％的农户要减少收入，这是一个非常值得注意的问题。希望各地都作一些有关社员收入情况的调查，抓紧秋收前这段时间，采取一切有效的措施，争取更多的社员都能增加收入。
    山西省雁北地区1955年只有25.6％的农户在初级社，今年春天，在合作化运动中，加入高级社的农户占总农户的94.7％。在大发展中，数村办一社、数社并一社的现象很普遍。新社员占社员总数70％以上。这些情况反映到高级合作化第一年的秋收分配中，到底会发生些什么问题，这是需要我们及早考虑的。为了了解这方面的情况，我们在朔县对七个典型社作了调查研究。七社的情况是这样：张家河红星社是老社又是先进社，老社员占70％，是由四个自然村、四个老社合并的一个大社；东福院、米西马庄两社是一步登天社（由互助组和单干户直接办高级社），东福院社又是两村合办的社，东关、西关、南关、祝家庄四社，同是以老社为基础，大量发展了新社员办成的大社。现在把调查的几个问题，分述如下：
    一、增产多少
    张家河等七社升高级社以后，在增产方面，采用了以下八条措施：
    一、在水利建设上，七社原来每人平均有清水地零点五亩；经过兴修水利，现在每个人平均有1.45亩。原有洪水灌溉地5，370亩，新扩大8，738亩。二、在增施底肥上，去年七社施肥面积占总耕地面积的60％，今年增加到84％；每亩施肥量由去年的1，100斤，增加到1，978斤。三、扩大了高产作物主要是玉米的播种面积。七社去年共试种玉米158亩，今年扩大5，321亩。四、推广了间作和套种（指麦田收割前即套种上其他作物）。去年共间作、套种1， 700亩，今年扩大6，521亩，占粮田作物面积的16.8％。五、实行合理密植，密植面积占总耕地面积的49％。六、这个地区历史上没有施追肥习惯，今年计划施追肥面积占总耕地面积的21％。七、开垦荒地900亩。八、每亩平均用工七个以上，比过去增加了三个。其他像推广优种、深耕等技术也有了改进。
    以上八条增产措施所发挥的作用综合起来，估计平均每亩可增产78斤。如以此作为增产标准，要比七社“三定”平均单产120斤提高65％，比去年每亩实产102.625斤提高76％。
    在审查修订1956年的生产规划的时候，七社最后计划平均每亩指标为175.75斤。
    七个社修订计划后的具体情况，大体可分为三类：东关、祝家庄、南关三社土地好，每亩产量为185斤到209斤。西关、张家河两社的土地次些，每亩产量178斤到179斤。米西马庄、东福院两社土地又次，每亩产量118斤到131斤。副业的增产计划虽也作了修订，但对副业生产上的潜力还挖掘的不够。
    二、试算分配结果
    从七社总的情况看：1956年七个社的总收入共1，059，604元，其中农业收入占90.15％，副业收入占9.85％，比1955年总收入增加了56.4％。张家河增加最多，为101％；南关最少，为18.4％；其他五社增加32％到82％。
    各项开支如下：国家税收、公粮加副业税占总收入的7.75％，祝家庄最高，为9.5％，西关最低，为5.6％，其他五社6％到7％。
    合作社留的公积金和公益金占总收入的6.4％，张家河最多，为9.5％，米西马庄最少，为2.1％，其他五社6％左右。
    管理费占总收入0.48％，祝家庄最多，为0.64％，张家河最少，为0.24％。
    当年的生产投资占总收入的21.46％，米西马庄最高占25％，东福院最低占13.6％。
    七社上述四项开支共占总收入的36.1％，社员个人纯收入占总收入的63.9％。共款六十七万七千多元，比1955年增加53.16％。张家河增加最多，为105％，南关增加最少，为4％。
    试算结果，七社共2，489户，比去年增加收入户2，148户，占总户数的86.3％，减收户238户，占总户数的9.6％，未计算户103户（减少劳力户和五保户），占总户的4.1％。南关社减收的户最多，占总户数的36.7％，张家河社减收户最少占1.7％，东福院社减收户占13.4％，其他四社减收户占4％以上，9％以下。
    增加收入户中，比去年增加50％以下者，占增收户的41.2％；增加50％以上、二倍以下者占48.3％；增加二倍以上者10％强。
    减收户中，比去年减少50％以下者，占减收户的63％，减收50％以上者，占减收户的37％。
    减收户减收的原因有三：①去年有胶皮车、大车搞副业或种菜园，收入大，入高级社这些收入没有了，因而减收的84户，这些户大部是上中农和富农，少部是中农。②因地多、地好、有牲口而减收的66户，大都为上中农。③因劳力弱，有疾病，作的劳动日少而减收的88户，大都是贫农和下中农。
    这些减收户中，减收最大者为上中农和富农，根据对东关、南关、东福院三社20户（131人）上中农和富农的调查，他们1955年纯收入每人平均为106元，1956年预计每人平均为五十七元。两年比较，几乎减收一半。
    对张家河等社四十户（120口人）的减收贫农调查，今年预计纯收入平均每人只24.5元。
    七社分别来看：祝家庄、米西马庄两社去年有灾情，收入少，因此今年收入比去年增加大。同时，去年各种类型社员收入比较平衡。试算结果，保证了90％以上户增加了收入。
    张家河、东关、西关三社经济作物或副业生产占相当比重，但去年收入基础悬殊甚大，如张家河四个老社中，原张家河社每个社员平均纯收入六十二元，其他三社平均纯收入四十元左右。又如东关老社员每人纯收入61.7元，新社员则平均41.8元。这种悬殊情况对今年的分配来说，如没有显著的增产和纯收入显著增加，实现90％社员户收入增加是有困难的。
    东福院社是一步登天社。这里土地改革不彻底，长期以来是落后村。上中农、富农占总户数8％左右。而且两村并一社，条件不相同，一个村地多又好，一个村地少，劳力多。副业生产、经济作物种植得极少。试算结果13.4％户减少收入。
    南关社土地好，副业和经济作物收入占总收入36.5％，但因今年比去年少种山药600亩，减少收入一万元，瓦窑业和其他副业停顿了，比前一年减少收入一万多元，老社员去年收入多基础高，试算结果36.7％户减少收入。老社员69户，减收户四十二户，占老社员的60％。
    三、从分配试算看出的几个问题
    第一，能否增产、多少社员增加收入是调查中注意的中心问题。从调查材料看，数村办一社，各村条件不同；数社并一社，收入基础不同；老社扩大，新老社员的收入情况不同；在这种复杂的具体情况下，在高级合作化头一年的分配中社员收入增减的变化是很大的。要使去年收入基础高的社员今年收入也能不低于去年，达到90％的社员户增加收入，只有一般的增产，没有显著的增产是办不到的。
    第二，生产增加了，能不能保证收入增加？关键在于分配的时候正确处理国家、合作社和社员个人三方面的关系。七社在分配试算中，紧紧掌握了这一点，并以保证社员能分到总收入的60％以上为标准。七社试算结果，社员分到的一般都在64％至65％左右。最少的也有61％。能不能保证增加收入的另一个关键问题在于能否执行勤俭办社的方针。七个社原计划当年生产投资占总收入的30.9％。调查中经过逐条检查，压缩开支，减少到占总收入21.94％，共节省开支90，022元。因而直接保证了社员分益比例。
    第三，由于社和社、村和村，新社员和老社员收入基础的不平衡，今年收入的增加，也就相差较大。一般是原来收入基础高的，今年增加收入少些，甚至有减少收入的。克服这种不平衡现象是不容易的，除积极扩大生产门路、力求增加生产外，对去年收入基础高，今年增加收入少的户，要想法使他们能增加些收入，并注意加强思想教育，以减轻矛盾。
    四、必须做好的几件工作
    第一、实现高级合作化以后，更应该充分利用集体生产的优越性，作到人尽其才，提高劳动效率。据检查七社在四月三十日以前的半年的时间内，劳动管理方面的问题很大。按正常情况计算，应作劳动日173，820个，但他们只做到93，380个。另外劳动定额制定得不合理。如地不分远近、牛不分好坏、活不分轻重等，都直接影响到社员的劳动热情。这些问题各社虽然作了检查，并给剩余劳力安排了出路，制定了田间生产队的管理办法和修定了劳动定额，但今后还应注意不断的加以改进。
    第二、树立全面生产观点，作好全面生产规划。七个社除个别社外，共同的偏向有两条，即只重视农业生产，忽视副业生产；只重视粮食作物生产，忽视经济作物生产。七社的副业生产，除东关、西关、南关等三社外，其它四社都差。张家河社的副业收入只占总收入的1.84％（经济作物较多），东关社由于重视了副业和经济作物生产，每人总收入平均有109元，这些情况向我们提出了一个重要的问题，即必须因地制宜地作出副业生产规划和发展经济作物种植规划，使生产全面地发展起来。
    第三、七个社对组织社员的家庭副业生产上，存在严重的缺点。甚至采取许多错误办法限制社员搞家庭副业生产。比如，对社员在社劳动时间和在家劳动时间没有规定，单纯强调在社劳动；对社员应分的小块菜地分给远地、坏地，张家河社因怕社员往自留地多上肥、多加工，采取了年年调换自留地的办法。因为限制过多，社员养猪养鸡逐年减少。这种情况不应该让它继续下去。
    第四、贯彻勤俭办社方针，作好财务管理工作，克服财务开支上的铺张浪费，这不论在社干部思想上和具体工作上仍然是必须重视的问题。虽然七社并未发生严重的浪费，但还有若干未引起人们注意的浪费现象。
