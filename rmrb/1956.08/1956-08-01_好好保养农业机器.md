    Take Good Care of Agricultural Machines
    Gao Xinhua
    Recently, there have been more and more machines in the countryside. The rumbling sounds of boiler engines, diesel engines, electric motors, seeders, harvesters, and water pumps are breaking the tranquility of the countryside and the fields.
    The transition from using manual farm tools to using some modern machines shows that China's agricultural technology is progressing. However, if you inspect the usage of these machines, you will find that there are still many problems in many places. Last winter, the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuxiang Township, Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, used a diesel engine to pump water to irrigate wheat. The person managing the machine did not drain the water from the water tank, resulting in the tank freezing and breaking. The machine was transported to Taiyuan, costing 600 yuan in repair fees, and it still has not been fully repaired. Individual farmers say, "The death of a livestock is like half the sky collapsing"; the loss from the destruction of a valuable machine by an agricultural production cooperative is no less than the death of a livestock for an individual farmer.
    The state will supply more and more machines to the countryside, and the problem of maintaining these machines will inevitably become greater. What urgently needs to be solved now is not only supplying the rural areas with a large number of inexpensive and high-quality machines, but also helping the rural areas cultivate a sufficient number of people who can master the machines. Without talent, even the best machines will become scrap iron. Therefore, when provincial and county leading organs and various business departments consider equipping cooperatives with machines, they should also consider helping the cooperatives train personnel to operate the machines. Anyone who does not do this is only doing half the job, and it is the half that will not have any effect.
    Farmers like machines because they are rare; however, if this person touches it and that person moves it, it is easy to damage the machine, and even cause casualties. All cooperatives that have purchased new machines, in addition to educating all members about taking care of the machines, it is more important to establish the necessary system of responsibility: special personnel should be responsible for the storage, use, and repair of the machines, and no one should be allowed to tamper with them. Cooperatives should reward those who store, use, and repair the machines well; those who do poorly should be criticized or appropriately punished.

### 好好保养农业机器

    好好保养农业机器
  　高新华
    近来农村里的机器逐渐多起来了，锅驼机、柴油机、电动机、播种机、收割机、抽水机的轰轰隆隆的声音，打破了农村中和田野里静谧的空气。
    从使用手工农具到开始使用一些现代的机器，这说明我国的农业技术在进步。可是，如果把这些机器的使用状况检查一下，那你就会发现，在许多地方问题还是很多的。山西解虞县于乡镇幸福农业生产合作社在去年冬天用柴油机抽水浇小麦。管理机器的人没有把水箱里的水放出来，结果把水箱冻坏了。机器运到太原，共花了六百元修理费，直到现在还没有完全修理好。个体农民说“死一头牲口塌半边天”；农业生产合作社毁一部贵重机器，损失之大也不亚于个体农民死个牲口。
    国家供给农村的机器将会越来越多，保养这些机器的问题势必越来越大。现在迫切需要解决的，不仅是大量供应农村所需要的价廉物美的机器，而且要帮助农村培养足够数量的掌握机器的人材。如果没有人材，再好的机器也会变成废铁。所以，省的、县的领导机关和各个业务部门在考虑给合作社配备机器的时候，同时应该考虑帮助合作社培养操纵机器的人材。谁不这样作，谁就是仅仅把事情做了一半，而且是不会发生效果的一半。
    农民喜欢机器，因为它很希罕；但是，这个摸摸，那个动动，容易把机器弄坏，甚至发生伤亡事故。凡是购买了新式机器的合作社，除了要对全体社员进行爱护机器的教育以外，更重要的，是建立必要的责任制度：机器的保管、使用和修理都要有专人负责，不让大家乱动手。保管使用修理得好的，合作社要给以奖励；弄得不好的，要给以批评或者适当的处罚。
