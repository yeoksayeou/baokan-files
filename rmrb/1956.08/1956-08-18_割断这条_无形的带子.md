    Cut This "Invisible Cord"
    Zhu Bo
    In Shaanxi, one can hear criticisms everywhere about lower-level staff being unfamiliar with the new situation in the rural areas after collectivization, failing to change their old working styles, being accustomed to sitting in offices, and living in a busy, bureaucratic life…
    This criticism is reasonable, but it should be examined from two perspectives. On one hand, there are indeed some people who are used to sitting in offices listening to reports and drafting instructions and decisions. For these people, effective measures should be taken to get them out of the office and into the masses to solve practical problems. However, there are also some people who are willing to delve into reality, but they are all tied down by an "invisible cord"—meetings and official documents—and have no way to leave the office. According to Comrade Zhang Shucheng, Secretary of the NanZheng County Party Committee, from March to May this year, 22 department heads and section chiefs from NanZheng County attended 28 meetings at the provincial-level departments (some people attended two meetings), with meeting times (including travel) being at least 20 days, and some requiring more than a month. Other counties have similar situations, and some are even more serious than NanZheng County.
    What troubles the lower levels the most is that each meeting stipulates that it must be conveyed and discussed at the county party committee. The PingLi County Committee of the Communist Party of China listened to the conveyance of various meetings for seven consecutive days without finishing. The county committee believed that continuing to convey the meetings in this way was unacceptable, so it adopted a firm attitude, stopped the conveyance, and sought other solutions. It is said that some leading departments have opinions about the PingLi County Committee's approach.
    The situation of having too many official documents and instructions is also quite serious. According to statistics, the LinTong County People's Committee received a total of 7,134 official documents and telegrams from higher-level leading departments from January to June 24 this year, an average of more than 40 per day. These 40-plus documents are not just read by one person; many documents need to be circulated, commented on, and rewritten before being typed, reprinted, and sent to districts and townships. According to responsible comrades from NanZheng, PingLi and other counties, if the documents that the county party committee needs to read are not read for a few days, many will pile up. In order to avoid being criticized for bureaucratism, they have to brace themselves, put aside those urgent matters to be handled, and read the documents and telegrams.
    The main reason for the large number of meetings and official documents is that the provincial-level leading departments all emphasize the work of their own departments. For example, at the provincial level, there are departments for agriculture, forestry, water, animal husbandry, transportation, soil and water conservation, and meteorology, while at the special district and county levels, there is only a construction section. For some meetings that can be convened in a unified manner, the provincial-level departments still hold them separately, deploy them separately, and emphasize that the person in charge must attend the meeting each time. The same is true for official documents. For example, for official documents in the commercial system, if it is one issue, the provincial commercial departments can issue a joint instruction. However, it seems that each department cannot show its work achievements unless it issues some instructions and decisions separately. As a result, for the same issue, the provincial department of commerce, department store company, and the special district industry and commerce section, department store company, etc., each issue an instruction. As a result, the lower-level staff are busy with meetings and reading official documents every day. They call this an "invisible cord" that ties many people who do not want to sit in the office to the office.
    This "invisible cord" should be cut! And this change must start with the provincial-level leading departments, adopting a firm attitude, reducing meetings and official documents, frequently going down to the lower levels, and doing more concrete leadership.

    割断这条“无形的带子”
    朱波
    在陕西，到处都可以听到有人批评下边工作人员对合作化后的农村新情况不熟悉，不能转变老一套的工作作风，习惯坐在办公室，习惯生活在那种忙乱的事务主义的生活圈子里……。
    这个批评是有道理的，但是，应该从两方面来检查。一方面，确实有那么一部分人，习惯坐在办公室里听汇报，起草指示决定。对这些人，应该采取有效的措施，让他们离开办公室、深入到群众中去解决实际问题。但是，也有一部分人，他们满心愿意深入实际，然而他们都被一条“无形的带子”——会议和公文——捆住了，没有办法走出办公室。据南郑县县委书记张树诚同志谈，南郑县从今年三月到五月，全县共有22个部长和科长级的干部到省级各部门开了28次会，（有的一个人连开两次会），会议时间（连往返）最少是二十天，有的需要一个多月。其它各县都有类似的情况，甚至有些县比南郑县还要严重。
    最使下边头疼的是每次会议都规定一定要在县委会上传达讨论。中共平利县委会听各种会议的传达，一连听了七天还没有听完，该县县委会认为这样传达下去不得了，就采取了坚决态度，停止传达，想另外的办法解决。据说某些领导部门对平利县委这种作法还有意见。
    公文指示多的情况也是相当严重的。据统计，临潼县人民委员会今年一月到六月二十四日，共收到上级领导部门的公文、电报7，134件，每日平均40多件，这40多件公文并不是只经过一个人阅读就算完事的，有很多公文要传阅、批示，并且还要改头换面，交打字翻印后，发到区、乡。据南郑、平利等县负责同志谈，要县委阅读的文件，如果隔几天不看，就要积压很多，为了怕别人批评自己官僚主义，就硬着头皮，抛开那些急待办的事情，来阅读公文和电报。
    会议和公文多的原因主要是因为省级各领导部门都强调部门的工作。如省级有农、林、水、牧畜、交通、水土保持、气象等部门，而专署和县级只有一个建设科。省级各部门对某些可以统一召开的会议，也要分别召开，单独布置，而且每次都强调负责人出席会议。公文也同样是这种情况，例如商业系统的公文，本来是一个问题，省上各商业部门发一个联合指示就可以了，然而各部门似乎不单独发一些指示和决定就不能显示他们的工作成绩似的，结果，同一个问题，省商业厅、百货公司以及专署工商科、百货公司等都各发一个指示。这样一来，下边的工作人员就天天忙于开会、阅读公文。他们称这是一条“无形的带子”，把许多不愿坐办公室的人也都拴在办公室里了。
    这条“无形的带子”应该割断了！而这一转变必须先从省级各领导部门开始，采取坚决的态度，减少会议和公文，经常深入下去，多做些具体的领导。
