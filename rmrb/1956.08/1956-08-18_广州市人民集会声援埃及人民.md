Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 16th: People from all walks of life in Guangzhou held a rally this morning to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. More than 17,000 people participated in the rally, including workers, farmers, students, industrialists, businesspeople, street residents, the elderly and young people of various religious beliefs and ethnic minorities, as well as mothers holding infants.

	Feng Naichao, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his speech at the meeting that in the past twenty days, the 1.7 million people of Guangzhou have been concerned about the development of the historical event of the Egyptian people taking back the Suez Canal Company, and have expressed unlimited sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people. He emphasized that today is the opening day of the London Conference, and the Guangzhou people are gathering here to express their firm support for Egypt's just position and attitude. He warned the imperialists that they must learn from the wars in Korea and Vietnam and treat the just actions of the Egyptian people with a calm and realistic attitude; the use of force to threaten after conspiracies fail at the conference table is absolutely intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. Su Min, a representative of the workers, and He Peirui, a farmer from Sanyuanli, also spoke at the meeting. He Peirui's hometown bravely resisted imperialist aggression with earthen knives and spears one hundred and fifteen years ago. They warned the imperialists at the meeting to recognize the times. If the imperialists must make trouble, they will surely suffer the consequences.

	Representatives from women's circles, industrial and commercial circles, and Islam all expressed their support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people at the meeting.

	A telegram expressing the firm will of the people from all walks of life in Guangzhou was passed at the meeting and sent to Egypt.
