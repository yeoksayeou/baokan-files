    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai's leather industry has found new sources of leather raw materials this year. Jianxin Leather Factory recently used Yangtze finless porpoise skin to make leather and has achieved initial success in trial production. Now, the Shanghai Leather Industry Company plans to further conduct small-scale trial production. The surface of Yangtze finless porpoise skin is delicate, and the fiber structure is tight, so it can be used to make beautiful suitcases, handbags, wallets, and leather shoes. In the Yangtze River and Qiantang River, there are often groups of Yangtze finless porpoises swimming around. Using Yangtze finless porpoise skin to make leather is one of the ways to solve the shortage of leather raw material supply.
    Trial production of leather made from python skin has also been successful at the Shenzhong Leather Craft Cooperative. This kind of leather can be used for edging high-heeled leather shoes, and it looks very beautiful.
    This year, Shanghai's leather industry has also expanded the scope of pigskin use. Yimin Leather Factory recently used pigskin to make various colors of short coat leather and glove leather, with good gloss and softness. This factory has also trial-produced pigskin ball leather this year.

    皮革工业的新原料
    据新华社讯　上海皮革工业今年又找到了皮革原料的新来源。建信制革厂不久以前利用江猪皮制革，已经初步试制成功。现在，上海市皮革工业公司打算进一步进行小批试制。江猪皮的表面细致，纤维组织紧密，可以用来制成漂亮的皮箱、手提包、皮夹和皮鞋。在长江和钱塘江里，经常有成群的江猪游来游去。利用江猪皮制革，是解决皮革原料供应不足的办法之一。
    用蟒皮制革也在申中制革工艺社试制成功。这种皮革可做高跟皮鞋时镶边用，很好看。
    今年，上海制革工业还扩大猪皮的使用范围。益民制革厂最近用猪皮制成各色的短大衣革和手套革，光泽很好，也很柔软。这个厂今年还试制了猪皮球革。
