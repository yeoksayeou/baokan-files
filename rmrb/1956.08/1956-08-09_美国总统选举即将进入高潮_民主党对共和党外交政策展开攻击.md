Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Chicago Dispatch: The Democratic Party's platform committee began discussing and drafting the Democratic platform for the upcoming presidential election campaign in Chicago on August 6th, to be submitted to the Democratic National Convention, which will begin on August 13th, for discussion and adoption.

It is reported that the committee's representatives launched attacks on the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy. They pointed out that Republican policies almost plunged the United States into "disaster."

Robert Nathan, representing Americans for Democratic Action, and former Democratic Senator William Benton criticized Eisenhower for focusing too much on establishing military alliances while neglecting to build "friendships" abroad.

Benton pointed out: "Due to this one-sided emphasis on military pacts, Mr. Dulles and the Republican gang have put us in an unimaginable position, having to persuade the world to believe that we advocate peace."

Benton said that the Republican foreign policy trilogy is: "Intimidation, boasting, and retreat," and in the end, "we have fewer and fewer friends today, our allies are becoming more indifferent, and neutral countries are harboring doubts and even looking down on us."

Nathan said that the United States' foreign policy "scolds and threatens others, praises and insults others, sometimes hot and sometimes cold," and the result is often a "mess."

Many other representatives also pointed out that Republican foreign policy has brought a "series of failures" to the United States.

However, these Democratic representatives did not propose any alternative solutions; they simply advocated restoring the foreign policy of the Truman administration, while the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy and the Truman administration's policies were originally in the same vein.

    美国总统选举即将进入高潮
    民主党对共和党外交政策展开攻击
    新华社8日讯　芝加哥消息：民主党的政纲委员会八月六日在芝加哥开始讨论和拟订本届总统竞选运动中的民主党政纲，以便提交即将在八月十三日开始的民主党全国代表大会讨论和通过。
    据报道，这个委员会的代表们在外交政策问题上对艾森豪威尔政府展开攻击。他们指出共和党的政策差一点把美国投入“灾难”。
    代表美国人民主行动协会的罗伯特·内森和前民主党参议员威廉·本顿抨击艾森豪威尔太侧重建立军事联盟而忽视了在国外建立“友谊”。
    本顿指出：“由于这样片面强调军事公约，杜勒斯先生和共和党帮子已经使我们陷入了不堪设想的地位，而不得不去说服世界人士，叫他们相信我们是主张和平的。”
    本顿说，共和党的外交三部曲是：“恫吓、自吹和退却”，到头来，“我们今天的朋友愈来愈少，盟友愈来愈冷淡，中立国家对我们怀着疑虑，甚至是看不起我们”。
    内森说：美国在外交问题上“喝叱别人和威胁别人、吹捧别人和侮辱别人、一时热一时冷”，结果往往是“一团糟”。
    还有其他许多代表也指出共和党的外交给美国带来了“一系列的失败”。
    但是，这些民主党代表并没有提出什么代替的办法，他们只是主张恢复杜鲁门政府的外交政策，而艾森豪威尔政府的外交政策和杜鲁门政府的政策本来是一脉相承的。
