Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 12th. One hundred and fifty officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou held a get-together on the 10th with students of the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Students Summer Camp. In a friendly basketball match, the overseas Chinese students team lost to the officers' team. However, in the badminton match, the overseas Chinese students team overwhelmingly defeated the officers' team. At the same time as the ball games, the students demonstrated the making of toothpaste, soap, batteries, and soda water. The officers and soldiers watched the performances of these young scientists with great interest and even tasted the soda water they made on the spot.

Afterwards, the officers, soldiers, and students went to the banks of the Min River. Some who liked to swim jumped into the river in groups of three or five; many others danced, sang, and played games under the shade of the longan trees by the river; and still others strolled, talked, and made friends in the woods. As the sun set, they had a picnic by the river. In the evening, a party was held, at which the officers, soldiers, and overseas Chinese students performed song and dance programs.

    驻福州部队官兵同华侨学生联欢
    新华社福州12日电　中国人民解放军驻福州部队的一百五十名军官和士兵，在十日与福州市华侨学生夏令营的学生联欢。在篮球友谊比赛中，侨生队输给了军官队。可是在羽毛球比赛中，侨生队却大胜了军官队。在球赛的同时，学生们表演了制造牙膏、肥皂、电池和汽水等，官兵们津津有味地看了这些少年科学家们的表演，还尝了他们当场做出来的汽水。
    接着，军官、士兵和学生们来到了闽江岸边。一些喜欢游泳的人，三五成群地跳下江去游泳；另外许多人在江边的龙眼树荫下跳舞、唱歌、游戏；还有些人在丛林中散步、谈心、交朋友。太阳落山的时候，他们在江边进野餐。晚上举行了联欢晚会，会上官兵们和华侨学生们表演了歌舞节目。
