(Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS report) The "Ob" diesel-electric ship, which recently returned from Antarctica, left Leningrad again for the Arctic on August 4th. This voyage of the "Ob" is to transport a group of Soviet high-latitude marine research team members to the Arctic.

The area of this expedition is very vast. They will work for two months in the northern Greenland Sea and the area north of Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land. One of the main tasks of the scientists is to study the currents and warm currents between the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. The expedition will collect materials on hydrology, hydrographic surveying, meteorology, and aquatic zoology. They will also study the warm current in Spitsbergen and the cold current in East Greenland, as well as the seabed topography and geological structure in the Nansen Current area. The scientists' expedition is a continuation of the research work carried out by the icebreaker "Litke" last year. The "Ob" diesel-electric ship will pass through Stockholm to pick up several scientists from Sweden and Norway, who will conduct some research work in the Arctic together with the Soviet scientists.

    “鄂毕号”又去北极
    载一批海洋考察人员去做研究工作
    据新华社据塔斯社报道　不久以前从南极回国的“鄂毕号”柴油电远船八月四日又离开列宁格勒向北极出发了。“鄂毕号”这次远航，是把一批苏联高纬度海洋考察团的人员送到北极去。
    考察团这次考察的地区是非常广阔的。他们将在格陵兰海北部、斯匹次卑尔根和佛兰兹·约瑟夫地以北区域内工作两个月。科学家们的主要任务之一是研究北冰洋、大西洋和太平洋之间的水流和暖流。考察团将收集水文学、水路测量学、气象学和水生动物学的材料。他们还将研究斯匹次卑尔根的暖流和东格陵兰的寒流，南森急流地区的海底地形和地质结构。科学家们的考察是继续去年“利特克”破冰船所进行的研究工作。“鄂毕号”柴油电动船将经过斯德哥尔摩，把瑞典和挪威的几位科学家接上船来，他们将同苏联科学家一起去北极进行一些研究工作。
