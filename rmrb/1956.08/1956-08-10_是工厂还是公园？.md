    Factory or Park?
    Every day, many people come to visit our state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. The factory entrance is often packed with cars and people, just like a "busy market." From January to March this year, there were 102 visits with more than 40 people each time, totaling over 5,700 people. There were 113 visits with fewer than 40 people, totaling 1,300 people, with several visits happening every day. On March 2nd alone, there were 17 visits in one morning. In June, there were more than 20 visiting groups with over 200 people each, with the largest group having over 700 people.
    Every day, many people crowd into the workshops to visit, turning the workshops into "busy markets" as well. Workers say, "More people come to visit the factory than go to the park." Some visitors even talk to the workers in the workshops, asking about production. This inevitably distracts the workers and disrupts the order of the workshops. Some workers have even produced substandard cloth because of this.
    We welcome visits and exchange of experiences, but are so many visits really necessary? For example, among the guests we receive are housewives, children, students from the Geological Institute, Petroleum Institute, and People's Bank credit specialty class. They are all just coming to take a look; even some people passing through Beijing stop by for a while, sightseeing for half a day. Are these visits really indispensable for them?
    Each visiting group requests the factory to introduce the situation, and after being divided into groups, someone has to accompany them as a guide. Currently, the factory only has one cadre specifically responsible for receiving foreign guests. When this happens, we have to "conscript" people from various departments, which affects the daily work of those departments.
    The power to approve visits to our factory rests with the Ministry of Textile Industry. We have raised our concerns with the Ministry of Textile Industry countless times, hoping they could appropriately control the number of visits, but it hasn't been resolved. On the contrary, the number of visits is increasing. We hope the Ministry of Textile Industry will understand our situation and not let visits become a disaster.

### 是工厂还是公园？

    是工厂还是公园？
    每天都有许多人到我们国营北京第二棉纺织厂来参观。工厂的门前经常停满了汽车、挤满了人，如同“闹市”一般。从今年一月到三月，一次有四十人以上来参观的就有一百零二起、五千七百多人。四十人以下的一百一十三起、一千三百人，每天有好几起。三月二日这一天，一个上午就有十七起。六月份光二百多人以上的参观队伍就有二十多起，最大的队伍有七百多人。
    每天有许多人拥到车间来参观，车间也成了“闹市”。工人们说“来厂参观的比逛公园的人还多”。有些参观者在车间里还同工人谈话，问问生产情况。这就不能不分散工人的精力，打乱车间的秩序。有的工人就因为这个原因出了次布。
    我们欢迎参观，欢迎别人来交流经验，但是这么频繁的参观是不是都有必要呢？例如在接待的来宾里有家庭妇女、有小孩，也有地质学院、石油学院、人民银行信贷专业班的学生，他们都只是来看看的；甚至有些路过北京的人，也来逗留一番，游览半天。难道他们也是非参观不可吗？
    每来一批参观的人都要求厂里介绍情况，分组之后还要有人陪着当说明员。现在厂里只有一个专门负责接待外宾的干部。碰到这种情况，就不得不从各科室“拉伕”，影响了各科室的日常工作。
    到我厂来参观的批准权是由纺织工业部掌握的，我们曾向纺织工业部提过不知多少次意见，希望能适当控制一下，都没有得到解决，相反地，参观的越来越多。希望纺织工业部体谅下情，不要让参观成灾。　北京国棉二厂　张耀先（附图片）
