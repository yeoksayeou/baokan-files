Post-Editing Thoughts

    In Comrade Li Qidong's letter, "'Rushing' is excessive, but 'skill' is insufficient," he raises a very important question: What exactly is advanced experience?

    Whether it's increasing production or improving quality, there's a lot of experience. However, there's good experience, truly worthy of being called advanced; and there's experience that might not be good, and therefore might not be advanced. Since it's experience that can increase production or improve quality, why isn't it necessarily good or advanced? The reason lies in the fact that the secret of some advanced experience is to intensify labor. This kind of advanced experience may be effective for a while, but it never lasts; the characteristic of this kind of advanced experience is indeed that "rushing" is excessive and "skill" is insufficient.

    Comrade Li Qidong's letter refers to the textile industry. In fact, isn't there advanced experience in every industry and trade based on "diligent hands, diligent eyes, diligent legs" or "three diligences and four quicks," "four diligences and five quicks," and the like? It is very necessary to conduct a serious assessment of these advanced experiences that only focus on the word "diligence" to see if the disadvantages outweigh the advantages; if so, we must find ways to improve it and turn it into truly advanced experience.

    In the third quarter, a large number of capital construction projects began, and the supply of materials became even more tense. Amidst the vigorous efforts to save steel and cement, reading the letter from Construction Site 201 of the Second Construction Team of Jilin Provincial Construction Company about the disaster of excessive material requests, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of amusement and frustration.

    Regarding material supply work, some people have always held the view of "being prepared for the unexpected." Now it seems that "being prepared" not only doesn't necessarily prevent "unexpected events," but preparing too early and too much can even "cause disaster." What's the point?

    The material supply is indeed relatively tight, but if everyone honestly applies for materials and carefully calculates savings, it may not be so hopeless. As the saying goes, "A mediocre person troubles themselves." I wouldn't dare say that Construction Site 201 of the Second Construction Team of Jilin Provincial Construction Company is definitely full of "mediocre people," but "self-trouble" is true; and is it only self-trouble? If you request too many materials here and too early, leading to disaster, and someone else can't use them when they need them, that also becomes a disaster. Isn't that "troubling others after troubling yourself"?

    "Troubling yourself" and "troubling others" is doubly bad.

    The Huaibei Saltworks' approach to labor protection work is "not preparing before the rain, not mending the fold after the sheep are lost." The Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site seems slightly better; they at least "mended the fold after the sheep were lost," but unfortunately, they did too little, only "treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches." No wonder the result is similar to that of the Huaibei Saltworks: similar accidents happen again and again.

    The best approach is to prepare before the rain. If something is not done well, mending the fold after the sheep are lost is not too late. But the method of mending the fold like the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, is not worth learning from. "Mending the fold after the sheep are lost" is "not too late" precisely because it is hoped that this repair will also have the effect of "preparing before the rain" for future work-related injuries. The Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site only installs railings where people have fallen to their death and only inspects electrical equipment where people have been electrocuted. As for places where people have fortunately not fallen to their death or been electrocuted, the ladders still have no railings, and the wires still leak electricity. How can this have the effect of preparing before the rain?

    读者李起东同志在“‘抢’有余，‘巧’不足”的来信里，提出了一个很重要的问题：究竟什么是先进经验？
    增加产量也好，提高质量也好，经验都是很多的。但是，有好的、真正称得上先进的经验；也有未必是好的，因而未必是先进的经验。既然是能增加产量，或者是能提高质量的经验，为什么又未必是好的，未必是先进的呢？这原因就在于有些先进经验的秘诀是加强劳动强度。这类先进经验也许见效于一时，但总是好景不常的；这类先进经验的特点，确实是“抢”有余、“巧”不足。
    李起东同志的来信，是指着纺织工业说的。其实，那行那业没有几条“手勤、眼勤、腿勤”或“三勤四快”、“四勤五快”之类的先进经验呢？很有必要对这些只在“勤”字上做文章的先进经验进行一次认真的鉴定，看看有没有利少弊多的；若有的话，还要想办法把它提高一步，变成真正先进的经验才好。

    第三季度，基本建设工程大量开工，材料供应更是紧张起来。在大力节约钢材、水泥声中，读了吉林省建筑公司第二施工队201工地滥要材料成灾的来信，真有哭笑不得之感。
    对待材料供应工作，素来有人持“有备无患”的见解。现在看来，“有备”非但未必“无患”，而且备早了，备多了，还要“成灾”，这又何苦来？
    材料供应确实比较紧张，但是，人人都老老实实地申请材料，个个都精打细算地节约材料，也未必就一筹莫展。俗话说“庸人自扰”，不敢说吉林省建筑公司第二施工队201工地定有“庸人”，但“自扰”倒是真的；而且岂仅是自扰？你这里多要了材料，早要了材料，以致成灾，他那里要用用不上，也成了灾，不是“自扰扰人”吗？
    “自扰”而且“扰人”，这是双重的不好。

    淮北盐场对待劳动保护工作，是“雨前未绸缪，羊亡不补牢”。狮子滩水电站工地好像略好一些，他们“亡羊补牢”的工作还是做的；可惜做得太少，只是“头痛医头、脚痛医脚”而已。这就难怪结果也同淮北盐场差不多：同类事故再三发生。
    最好是未雨绸缪，若有不周，亡羊补牢，也不算太晚。但像狮子滩水电站工地这样头痛医头，脚痛医脚的亡羊补牢方法，是不足为训的。“亡羊而补牢”，所以“未为迟也”，就指望这一补，对未来的工伤事故说来，也能兼收“未雨绸缪”之效。狮子滩水电站工地哪儿跌死人才在哪儿安栏杆，哪儿电死人才在哪儿检查电器设备，至于幸而没有跌死人，电死人的地方，梯子还是没有栏杆，电线依然跑电，怎么能收未雨绸缪之效呢？
