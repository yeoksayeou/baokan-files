    Can a Disabled Person Not Join the Party?
    I am a member of the Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiba Township, Dayao, Yunnan. When I was three years old, I fell and injured my leg, and it has been difficult for me to walk ever since. This year, I have applied to the township Party branch for membership several times, but I have been rejected. The staff of the branch said: The Party Constitution stipulates that "disabled people cannot join the Party." I read the Party Constitution to him and explained that the scientist Gao Shiqi was also disabled and joined the Party after becoming disabled, but he still insisted on his opinion.
    This statement by the Xiba Township Party branch violates the Party Constitution. I hope the higher-level Party committee will strengthen the education of the staff of this branch.　Xi Renlian

    残废人就不能入党吗？
    我是云南大姚席坝乡高级农业生产合作社的社员，三岁时将脚摔伤，至今行走很不方便。今年，我曾经几次向乡党支部申请入党都遭到拒绝。支部工作人员说：党章上规定“残废人不能入党”。我曾把党章念给他听，又向他解释科学家高士其也是残废人，并且是残废后入党的，可是他还坚持自己的意见。
    席坝乡党支部这种说法是违反党章的，希望上级党委，对这个支部的工作人员加强教育。　席任联
