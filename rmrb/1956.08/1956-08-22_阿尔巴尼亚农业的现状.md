    The Current Situation of Albanian Agriculture
    Lin Li
    Before liberation, Albania was an agricultural country. Agricultural income accounted for more than 90% of the national economic income. However, at that time, Albania's agricultural production was very backward. Not only were there no modern agricultural machinery and collectivized large farms, but also the types of crops were very few. The country only had a handful of agricultural products such as corn, wheat, and olives. The country did not produce enough food for itself, and clothing fabrics were imported. Even simple tableware such as plates and dishes were rarely manufactured domestically. Therefore, people said that Albania was the most backward among the backward countries in Europe.
    But since liberation, especially after the completion of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1950 to 1955, the social outlook of Albania has undergone fundamental changes. The backward state of agricultural production is also gradually disappearing.
    Compared with 1938 before the war, the area of cultivated land in Albania has expanded by 71%, and grain output has increased by 154%. Albania, which never grew cotton before, now has 21,500 hectares of cotton fields, and the cotton produced domestically can basically meet the needs of the textile industry. With the rise and development of the sugar industry, Albanian farmers have learned the technology of growing sugar beets. In the past two years, people have no longer needed foreign sugar. Rice is a new product in Albanian agriculture, with a current area of 4,500 hectares. People have begun to eat rice produced by their own hands. Tobacco is one of Albania's main agricultural products for earning foreign exchange. In addition to meeting the needs of the domestic tobacco industry, it can also export a portion to the Soviet Union and various fraternal countries in Eastern Europe... These seemingly unremarkable changes are major events in the eyes of Albanians. Because all of this was unimaginable during the period of imperialism and feudal landlord rule.
    The increase in the types of crops and the increase in grain output are only a superficial phenomenon in the changes in Albania's agricultural production. What is important is the change in land ownership. In the past ten years, Albania's land ownership has undergone two major changes. One was the land reform at the beginning of liberation, in which the state distributed the confiscated landlord land to the peasants, creating conditions for the development of agricultural production. This task was completed in 1946. Another change was the organization of scattered individual economies into collective economies centered on cooperatives. This change began when the land reform ended and is still ongoing.
    As early as shortly after the end of the land reform, the Albanian Labor Party pointed out to the peasants that organizing agricultural production cooperatives was the only way to get Albanian agriculture out of its backward state. According to this instruction, the party committees at all levels of the Labor Party included the organization of cooperatives in their work agenda. The broad masses of peasants are also moving towards this goal. In the past ten years, Albania has organized 694 agricultural production cooperatives. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives is 29,478, accounting for 18.94% of the total number of peasant households in the country. The area of land joining the cooperatives is 93,616 hectares, accounting for 26.16% of the existing cultivated land in the country. Although the cooperative economy has not yet occupied an absolute advantage in the entire agriculture, none of the cooperatives have collapsed after they were built, and all of them have increased production and played a leading role in increasing the types of crops. In 1955, 54.8% of the sugar beets used by the sugar industry were supplied by cooperatives. The cotton output of agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 25% of the country's total cotton output. The production of tobacco and rice is also mostly controlled by cooperatives. In 1955, each hectare of wheat in agricultural production cooperatives yielded an average of 2.8 quintals more than individual farmers, corn 2.2 quintals more, cotton 3.4 quintals more, and sugar beets 110.3 quintals more. The superiority of agricultural production cooperatives has been recognized by all the peasants, so the number of people asking to join the cooperatives is increasing. At the end of 1955, Albania had only 318 agricultural cooperatives. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives was 15,313, accounting for 9.84% of the total number of peasant households in the country. The area of land joining the cooperatives was only 51,118 hectares, accounting for 14.48% of the country's cultivated land area. But in the past six months, 372 new cooperatives have been added in one membership campaign, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has exceeded the total number in the past ten years. Six months ago, the members of the cooperatives were mainly poor peasants, and middle peasants were still watching and waiting. But among the newly developed members, 42.4% are middle peasants. This means that the superiority of the cooperatives has not only been recognized by the broad masses of poor peasants, but has also become the common understanding of all peasants. Because of this foundation, the Albanian Labor Party has decided to popularize agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country during the second five-year plan, striving to have 70% of the peasants join the cooperatives and achieve basic agricultural collectivization throughout the country.
    In Albania's agricultural production, state-owned farms are an emerging and also an indispensable force. At present, there are 21 state-owned farms in Albania, covering an area of 21,000 hectares. Its task is mainly to manage dairy cows, vegetables, and special cash crops. At the same time, it is responsible for improving livestock breeds and supplying vegetable seeds needed throughout the country. The land of state-owned farms is concentrated, and most of it is mechanically harvested and mechanically cultivated. Although the quantity is not large, its role in the national economy is very important. For example, in 1955, the grain delivered by state-owned farms to the state was equivalent to 10% of the grain collected and purchased by the state from peasants and cooperatives. Vegetables accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 42%. Milk accounted for 30%. Sugar beets accounted for 17%. Meat accounted for 6%. State-owned farms are the leading force in Albania's agricultural production, and most of the land is newly reclaimed wasteland. The existing farms are constantly expanding, and new farms will be gradually established.
    In the museum in Tirana, agricultural tools that Albanian peasants were still using not long ago are on display. The wooden plows there are even coarser than ours in China, and the hoes and sickles are also more ancient and outdated than ours. But now, Albania's agricultural tools are progressing the fastest, and the changes are particularly significant. Among the 380,000 hectares of cultivated land in the country, 295,000 hectares are cultivated by tractors. In the plains of the main grain-producing areas, some are 100% mechanically cultivated, and some are mechanically harvested and mechanically sown by a percentage. Mechanization is generally ahead of collectivization, which is different from our China. At present, Albania has 21 machine tractor stations, owning 1,500 tractors (calculated in fifteen-horsepower standard units). By 1960, they plan to expand the number of mechanization by another 112%, making Albania the country with the highest level of agricultural mechanization in Europe.
    Albania's agriculture has changed, and it is advancing in the great ranks of socialist construction. However, its path forward is not smooth sailing, and it has encountered hardships and difficulties. In the first two years of the first five-year plan, in the initial period of embarking on a planned economy, the country's attention was almost entirely focused on industrial construction, and relatively less attention was paid to agriculture. As a result, a phenomenon of uncoordinated industrial and agricultural production occurred. The situation that agriculture could not keep up with the needs of industry hindered the balanced development of the national economy. Under this circumstance, the Central Committee of the Labor Party convened a meeting in 1953, deciding to increase agricultural investment, reduce investment in other sectors, and at the same time adopt measures to strengthen agricultural leadership. Because of this shift, by the time the first five-year plan was completed, the total value of agricultural production in 1955 had increased by 37% compared with 1950. But people are not satisfied with this achievement, and unanimously believe that the development of agricultural production is still slow. Therefore, how to further strengthen the leadership of agricultural production has become one of the central topics of the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party. The representatives unanimously pointed out in their speeches that during the first five-year plan, some places did not pay due attention to the development of agricultural production cooperatives; some places underestimated the level of awareness of the peasants and did not dare to vigorously develop the cooperative movement; some places overemphasized that collectivization must have mechanization as a prerequisite... All of these have more or less hindered the development of cooperatives. Regarding the fact that the number of cooperatives has more than doubled in the past six months, many comrades believe that it has been influenced by the high tide of China's collectivization. In order to basically solve the problem of collectivization during the second five-year plan, and in order to further study China's experience in agricultural collectivization, the Albanian government has sent an agricultural delegation to China for investigation. This delegation is now visiting various parts of our country.

    阿尔巴尼亚农业的现状
    林里
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚是一个农业国。在国民经济收入中，农业收入占90％以上。然而那时，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产非常落后。那里不但没有近代化的农业机械和集体化的大农庄，而且农作物的种类也非常稀少。全国只有玉米、小麦和橄榄等寥寥可数的几样农产品。自己生产的粮食不够吃，穿衣用布是外来的。就是一些盘盘碟碟的简单餐具，也很少是自己制造的。因此，人们说阿尔巴尼亚在欧洲落后国家中是最落后的。
    但是自从解放以后，特别是1950年到1955年的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划完成以后，阿尔巴尼亚的社会面貌已经发生了根本性的变化。农业生产上的落后状态也在逐渐消逝着。
    拿现在的情况跟战前时期的1938年相比，阿尔巴尼亚的耕地面积扩大了71％，粮食产量增加了154％。从来不种棉花的阿尔巴尼亚，现有棉田21，500公顷，本国出产的棉花基本上可以满足纺织工业的需要了。随着制糖工业的兴起和发展，阿尔巴尼亚的农民学会了种植甜菜的技术。近两年来，人们已经不再需要外国的食糖了。稻谷是阿尔巴尼亚农业上的新产品，现有4，500公顷。人们开始吃用自己的手生产出来的稻米了。烟草是阿尔巴尼亚换取外汇的主要农产品之一。除了满足本国制烟工业的需要之外，还可以输出一部分给苏联和东欧的各个兄弟国家……。这些看来并不突出的变化，在阿尔巴尼亚人的眼里却是天翻地复的大事。因为在帝国主义和封建地主统治时期，所有这些都是不可想像的。
    农作物种类的增多，粮食产量的提高，在阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产的变化上，还只是一个表面现象，重要的还是土地所有制的改变。近十年来，阿尔巴尼亚的土地所有制经过了两次重大变革。一次是解放初期的土地改革，国家把没收来的地主土地，分给了农民，为农业生产的发展创造了条件。这个任务在1946年已经完成了。另一个变化是把分散的个体经济，组织成以合作社为中心的集体经济。这个变化从土地改革结束的时候开始，直到现在还在继续进行。
    早在土地改革结束后不久，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党就向农民指出：组织农业生产合作社，是使阿尔巴尼亚农业摆脱落后状态的唯一道路。根据这一指示，劳动党的各级党委就把组织合作社列入了自己的工作日程。广大农民也向着这个目标前进。十年来，阿尔巴尼亚已经组织起694个农业生产合作社。入社农民29，478户，占全国总农户的18.94％。入社土地93，616公顷，占全国现有耕地的26.16％。合作经济虽然还没有在整个农业中占到绝对优势，但所有的合作社建成后还没有一个垮台，而且全都增了产，在增加农作物的种类上起了带头作用。在1955年内，制糖工业所用的甜菜，有54.8％是由合作社供给的。农业生产合作社的棉花产量，占全国产棉总量的25％。烟草和稻谷的生产也大都掌握在合作社手里。在1955年内，农业生产合作社的每一公顷小麦，平均比个体农民多收2.8公担，玉米多收2.2公担，棉花多收3.4公担，甜菜多收110.3公担。农业生产合作社的优越性已为全体农民所公认，因此，要求入社的人数越来越多了。在1955年年底，阿尔巴尼亚一共才有318个农业社。入社农民15，313户，占全国总农户的9.84％。入社土地也只有51，118公顷，占全国耕地面积的14.48％。可是近半年来，在一次入社运动中，就增加了372个新社，入社农户超过了以往十年的总数。半年前，合作社的成员主要是贫农，中农还在观望、等待。但在新近发展的社员当中，42.4％是中农。这就是说，合作社的优越性，已经不仅为广大贫农所承认，而且变成所有农民的共同认识了。因为有了这个基础，所以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党决定在第二个五年计划期间，把农业生产合作社普及全国，争取70％的农民入社，做到全国农业基本合作化。
    在阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产中，国营农场是一支新兴的、也是不可忽视的力量。现在全阿尔巴尼亚共有国营农场21个，占地21，000公顷。它的任务，主要是经营乳牛、蔬菜和特种经济作物。同时负责改良牲畜品种，供应全国各地所需要的蔬菜种籽。国营农场的土地集中，又多是机械收割和机械耕种。数量虽然不大，但在国民经济中的作用是十分重要的。例如在1955年，国营农场交给国家的谷物粮食，就相当于国家向农民和合作社征收和购买的粮食的10％。蔬菜占的比例最大，达到42％。牛奶占30％。甜菜占17％。肉类占6％。国营农场是阿尔巴尼亚农业生产上的领导力量，所有土地又大多是新开垦的荒地。已有的农场在不断扩大，新的农场还将逐步建立。
    在地拉那的博物馆里，陈列着阿尔巴尼亚农民不久前还在使用着的农具。那里的木犁比我们中国的还要粗笨，锄头、镰刀也比我们的更古老、更陈旧。可是现在，阿尔巴尼亚的农业工具进步最快，变化也特别显著。在全国38万公顷耕地当中，就有295，000公顷是用拖拉机耕种的。主要产粮区的平原地带，有的是100％用机械耕种，有的是百分之几十用机械收割和机械播种。机械化一般都是走在合作化的前头，这是同我们中国不同的。现在阿尔巴尼亚有21个机器拖拉机站，拥有1，500台拖拉机（以十五马力标准台计算）。到1960年，他们计划把机械化的数量再扩大112％，使阿尔巴尼亚成为欧洲农业机械化水平最高的国家。
    阿尔巴尼亚的农业改观了，在社会主义建设的伟大行列中前进着。然而它的前进道路并不是一帆风顺的，它曾经碰到过艰苦和困难。在第一个五年计划的头两年，在走上计划经济的最初时期，国家的注意力几乎全都集中在工业建设上，对农业方面的注意相对减弱了。结果产生了工农业生产不协调的现象。农业赶不上工业需要的情况妨碍着国民经济的均衡发展。在这种情况下，劳动党中央委员会在1953年召开了会议，决定增加农业投资，削减其他部门的投资，同时采取了加强农业领导的措施。因为有了这一转变，所以到第一个五年计划完成时，1955年的农业生产总值，就比1950年增加了37％。但是人们并不满足于这个成就，而且一致认为农业生产的发展还是缓慢的。所以如何进一步加强农业生产的领导，就成了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会的中心议题之一。代表们在发言中一致提出，第一个五年计划期间，有些地方对于农业生产合作社的发展没有给予应有的重视；有些地方对于农民的觉悟程度估计不足，不敢大力发展合作化运动；有些地方过分强调合作化要有机械化为前题的条件，……所有这些，都或多或少地妨碍了合作社的发展。对于近半年内合作社能够一下增加一倍多的事实，许多同志认为是受了中国合作化高潮的影响。为了在第二个五年计划时期基本上解决合作化的问题，为了进一步研究中国农业合作化的经验，阿尔巴尼亚政府已派遣了一个农业代表团来中国考察。这个代表团现在正在我国各地参观访问。
