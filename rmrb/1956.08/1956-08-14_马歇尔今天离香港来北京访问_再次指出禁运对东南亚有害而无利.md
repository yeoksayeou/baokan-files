Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th August. Former Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, said in Hong Kong on August 11th: "The embargo is only harmful and not beneficial to Southeast Asia, which should have direct trade relations with China."

Marshall is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Beijing on August 14th. Answering reporters' questions at a tea party hosted by the "United Nations Association of Hong Kong" about why he was visiting China, he said: Because China, India, and Japan are the three major countries in Asia, and the development of these three countries will definitely affect Singapore. Moreover, China is the homeland of 76% of Singapore's residents. He wants to visit China to observe its customs, culture, and political and economic development. He pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed him to visit.

He also said that as an advisor to the Singapore trade delegation to China, he also has a responsibility to make some arrangements so that the delegation's visit can achieve the greatest possible gains.

Marshall reiterated that his visit to China was to obtain factual information. He said: "The most important thing is to know the truth. You cannot erect an iron curtain yourself and throw bricks at people from behind the iron curtain."

    马歇尔今天离香港来北京访问
    再次指出禁运对东南亚有害而无利
    新华社香港13日电　前新加坡首席部长马歇尔八月十一日在香港说：“禁运对于应该同中国有直接贸易关系的东南亚，只有坏处，没有好处。”
    马歇尔定在八月十四日离开香港前往北京访问。他在“联合国香港协会”欢迎他的茶会上回答新闻记者提出的为什么要到中国访问的问题时说：因为中国、印度、日本是亚洲的三大国，这三国的发展，一定会影响新加坡，何况中国又是新加坡76％的居民的故乡。他要到中国考察的是风土人情以及政治和经济的发展。他指出周恩来总理欢迎他去访问。
    他又说，作为新加坡贸易访华团的顾问，他也有责任要作一些安排，使得贸易团的访问可能得到最大的收获。
    马歇尔重申他到中国去是希望获得真实的情况。他说：“最重要是认识真相，你们不能自己树起了铁幕，躲在铁幕背后向人抛砖头。”
