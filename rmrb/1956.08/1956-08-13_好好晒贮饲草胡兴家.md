This summer has seen more rain, and some regions have recently suffered from typhoons and rainstorms, causing some fodder grass to be soaked, submerged, or washed away. According to estimates from Henan Province, the province has lost more than 5 billion jin of wheat straw, accounting for about one-third of the province's wheat straw. Therefore, properly sun-drying and storing fodder grass is a matter worthy of attention at present.

Fodder grass that has been rained on and has become moldy may be poisonous and should be sorted out for use as fuel or fertilizer. Fodder grass that has been rained on but has not yet become moldy should be quickly spread out to dry before being stacked. If there is continuous rainy weather, wooden sticks or bamboo poles can be used to build tripods six or seven feet high, and then small wooden sticks or bamboo poles one foot long can be nailed onto each wooden stick or bamboo pole every foot from two feet above the ground. The fodder grass can be placed on top of these, so that the air circulates within the grass pile and it will not heat up and become moldy.

During typhoons, some crops may be blown down. They should be actively salvaged. If they cannot be salvaged, they should be cut down and dried as fodder as soon as possible, and the land should be cleared for replanting. If conditions permit, it is best to make these stalks and vines into silage.

This year's rainfall is abundant, and wild grass is growing well. Agricultural cooperatives should organize labor to actively harvest it. In addition to feeding it fresh, it can also be made into silage or dried hay. Feeding livestock with this dried hay can save miscellaneous grains and also maintain their condition.

### 好好晒贮饲草胡兴家

    好好晒贮饲草胡兴家
    今夏雨水较多，特别是部分地区最近遭受台风暴雨，有些饲草被雨淋湿、浸泡或冲走。据河南省估计，全省损失麦草五十多亿斤，占全省麦草的三分之一左右。因此，好好晒贮饲草，就是当前值得注意的一件事情了。
    凡被雨淋水湿发了霉的饲草，都可能有毒，应挑出作为燃料或肥料；被淋湿还没有发霉的饲草，应该赶快摊开晒干，再行堆成垛子。如果连续阴雨，可应用木棒或竹竿搭成六、七尺高的三足架，再在每根木棒或竹竿上面从距地二尺处、每隔一尺钉入一根一尺长的小木棒或竹竿，把饲草搭在上面，这样草堆内空气流通，就不会发热发霉了。
    在台风中，有些农作物被风吹倒了，应该积极挽救，如果已经无法挽救，就应该及早割下来晒干，作为饲草，同时也好让出地方来进行补种。有条件的话，最好把这些秸蔓都作成青贮饲料。
    今年雨水多，野草长得好，农业社应组织劳动力积极收割，除鲜喂外，还可以做成青贮饲料或晒成干草。用这种干草喂养牲畜，既能节约杂粮，还能保膘。
