    Chinese Art Exhibition Held in Kobe, Japan
    (By our correspondent) The Chinese Studies Association of Kobe City University of Foreign Studies, Japan, recently held the Third Modern Chinese Art Exhibition in the Kobe Asahi Hall to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. The exhibition was organized by Japanese printmaker Seiji Ozaki and others, with the assistance of the Chinese Artists Association and the support of the Kobe branch of the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper.
    This exhibition focused on Chinese woodcuts, displaying 106 woodcuts, arranged in four periods according to the stages of historical development: the early period, the Anti-Japanese War period, the War of Liberation period, and the post-liberation period. Among them, the early works were donated to Japanese friend Kakichi Uchiyama (younger brother of Kanzo Uchiyama, lecturer at the woodcut training course held by Lu Xun in 1931) by Mr. Lu Xun during his lifetime. The exhibition also featured 84 Chinese folk paper cuttings, 11 New Year pictures, and 12 propaganda posters and commemorative stamps, totaling 213 exhibits.
    The exhibition attracted many visitors and received great attention and welcome. One visitor wrote: "The arrangement of Chinese woodcuts according to historical stages is very meaningful. In particular, there is a clear difference between the pictures before and after liberation. Seeing the post-liberation works, I couldn't help but take a deep breath, which made me feel delighted." Another visitor wrote: "Seeing the Chinese paper cuttings, I find them really interesting, and the art of paper cutting is outstanding. The pre-liberation woodcuts depict the pain and anger of the people, which is very similar to our current society. I am very grateful to see these outstanding works."

    日本神户举办中国美术展览
    本报讯　日本神户市外国语大学中国研究会，为了纪念鲁迅先生逝世二十周年，最近在神户朝日会馆大厅举办了第三次现代中国美术展览会。这个展览会是经过日本版画家尾崎清次等的筹备，在中国美术家协会的协助和日本“朝日新闻”社神户支局的支持下举行的。
    这次展览以中国木刻为中心，展出木刻一百零六幅，以历史发展的阶段分四期陈列，即：初期、抗日战争时期、解放战争时期和解放后。其中初期作品部分，是鲁迅先生生前寄赠日本朋友内山嘉吉的（内山完造之弟，1931年鲁迅举办的木刻讲习会的讲师）。展览会还展出了中国民间剪纸八十四幅，年画十一幅，宣传画和纪念邮票十二幅。总计展出二百一十三幅。
    这次展出，吸引了不少观众，受到极大的重视和欢迎。一位观众写道：“中国木刻按历史阶段排列是很富意义的。特别是解放前与解放后的画面，有着明显的不同，看到解放后的作品时，不觉吸口大气，使我感到欣喜。”又一位观众写着：“看到中国剪纸，实在深具趣味，剪纸艺术是很出众的。解放前的木刻，刻划着人民的痛苦与愤怒，和目前我们的社会是很相似的。看到这些杰出的作品十分感谢。”
