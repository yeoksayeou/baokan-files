    Lanzhou Building Workers' New Village
    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou) To solve the housing problems of Shanghai workers' families who have come to Lanzhou to participate in construction, Lanzhou City has decided to build a workers' new village.
    This workers' new village is quite close to the construction sites of several large enterprises in Lanzhou. Consumer cooperatives, canteens, bathhouses, health clinics, schools, and other public buildings to serve the families of employees will also be built near the workers' new village.

    兰州兴建工人新村
    本报兰州讯　为了解决来兰州参加建设的上海工人家属的住宿问题，兰州市决定建设一个工人新村。
    这个工人新村距离兰州几个大型企业的工地相当近。在工人新村附近，还要修建消费合作社、食堂、浴池、保健室、学校以及其他为职工家属服务的公共建筑物。
