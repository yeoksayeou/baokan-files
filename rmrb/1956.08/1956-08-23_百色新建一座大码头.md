Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st. The largest pier on the Youjiang waterway, the Baise Pier, is under construction. More than 400 construction workers are working day and night on the pier construction site in Baise, a mountain city surrounded by mountains. At present, two large warehouses, which are the main projects of the pier, have been completed. The entire pier project is expected to be completed by the end of November this year.
	Baise Pier is being built to adapt to the increasingly busy new situation of Youjiang shipping. According to statistics from the department managing shipping here, since the beginning of this year, the average monthly volume of various materials imported and exported from Baise via Youjiang shipping has reached 8,000 to 9,000 tons, an increase of about 100% compared to the busiest month of December last year. At present, the number of passenger and cargo ships regularly sailing in the Youjiang waterway has increased by nearly 200% compared to last year. However, the original pier in Baise was very small, and many materials were often backlogged in the ship's hold and could not be unloaded in time. These phenomena can be changed after the new pier is completed.

    百色新建一座大码头
    新华社南宁21日电　右江航道上最大的一座码头——百色码头正在兴建。群山环绕的百色山城边的码头工地上，现在有四百多名建筑工人在日夜劳动。目前，码头主要工程中的两座大仓库已经完成。整个码头工程预计在今年十一月底就可以全部完工。
    百色码头是为了适应右江航运日益繁忙的新形势而兴建的。据这里管理航运的部门统计，今年以来，右江航运从百色进出口的各种物资平均每月达八、九千吨，比去年航运最忙的十二月份增加一倍左右。目前，经常航行在右江航道中的客货轮比去年增加近两倍。但是百色原有的码头很小，常常有许多物资积压在船舱里不能及时卸下。新的码头建成以后，这些现象就可以改变了。
