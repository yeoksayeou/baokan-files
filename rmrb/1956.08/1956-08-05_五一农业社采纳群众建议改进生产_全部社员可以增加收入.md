Xinhua News Agency, Yining, August 2nd. The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Yining County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, adopted rationalization proposals from its members to improve production, and this year 100% of its members can increase their income.

This year, Wuyi Cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops. In the past, the average yield of spring wheat was about 130 jin per mu, but this year it can increase by about 100 jin per mu; the winter wheat, which was first trial-planted last year, can harvest an average of more than 300 jin per mu. The 4,000 mu of rice and more than 600 mu of autumn crops such as corn generally have more seedlings and grow strongly because of the increased sowing amount and the changed extensive field management in the past. The cooperative's management committee initially estimates that the income of all members this year can be increased compared to last year.

The production development and increased income of the members of the Wuyi Cooperative are inseparable from the fact that the cooperative's management committee consults with the masses on everything and adopts the rationalization proposals of the members. This year, the dozens of rationalization proposals put forward by the members regarding agricultural production, water conservancy construction, and labor arrangement played a significant role in improving production and management. This year, the cooperative plans to spend a large sum of money to build stables, sheds, offices, clubs, and warehouses. The members put forward suggestions to reduce expenditure. They believe that the stables are related to the safety and health of the 180 horses in the cooperative and need to be built. As for the warehouse, the members are willing to give up their original houses for the cooperative to use; the club will not be built temporarily because the cooperative was only established half a year ago and the family property is not strong. The cooperative's management committee adopted these suggestions, which can save at least more than 2,000 yuan just in the purchase of materials. The adoption of many suggestions from the members has further strengthened the concept of loving the cooperative. In previous years, many people had to go to the mountains to escape the summer heat. This year, the members are not avoiding the heat and are working hard in the fields to harvest, ensuring a bumper harvest.

### 五一农业社采纳群众建议改进生产  全部社员可以增加收入

    五一农业社采纳群众建议改进生产
    全部社员可以增加收入
    新华社伊宁2日电　新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁哈萨克族自治州伊宁县五一农业社采纳社员合理化建议来改进生产，今年百分之百的社员可增加收入。
    五一社今年夏田获得空前大丰收。过去春麦平均每亩产量为一百三十斤左右，今年每亩可增产一百斤左右；去年第一次试种的冬麦平均每亩可收三百多斤。四千亩水稻和六百多亩玉米等秋田，因为加大了播种量，改变了过去粗放的田间管理，普遍苗多，长得茁壮。社务管理委员会初步计算，今年全部社员的收入都可以比去年有所增加。
    五一社生产发展和社员收入增加，是和社务管理委员会有事和群众商量，采纳社员的合理化建议分不开的。今年社员们提出的有关农业生产、水利建设和安排劳力等几十件合理化建议，对改进生产和管理起了重大作用。今年社里打算支出很大一笔款，修建马厩、车棚、办公室、俱乐部和仓库。社员们提出减缩开支的建议。他们认为马厩有关社内一百八十匹马的安全和健壮，需要修建，至于仓库，社员们愿让出各家原有的供社使用；俱乐部因社刚成立半年，家底不厚实，暂时不修。社务管理委员会采纳了这些建议，其中仅购买材料一项，最少就可节约二千多元。社员们的许多建议被采纳，使得进一步加强了爱社观念。往年盛夏，许多人要到山中避暑。今年社员们正不避炎热，紧张下田收割，保证丰产丰收。
