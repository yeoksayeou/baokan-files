    Musk and the Musk Deer

    Musk is one of China's famous specialty products, and China ranks first in the world in terms of musk production and quality. Musk is more valuable than gold, costing more than one hundred yuan per two.
    In traditional Chinese medicine, musk is a widely used drug. Many famous and effective patent medicines cannot be without musk. Among the commonly used Chinese medicines, dozens require it. Regarding the medicinal effects of musk, Li Shizhen, a great Chinese pharmacist of the Ming Dynasty, said in the "Compendium of Materia Medica": "It opens the orifices, clears the meridians, penetrates the muscles and bones, resolves alcohol poisoning, eliminates undigested fruit and food, and treats stroke, qi stagnation, evil influences, phlegm syncope, and abdominal masses." Folk legends say it can "prevent pregnancy," "induce abortion," and "ward off snakes."
    In terms of its application as a fragrance, China has been using musk and herbal fragrances to decorate walls, perfume clothes, or make small pills to hold in the mouth for over a thousand years. In modern times, countries around the world also use it to make expensive perfumes, powders, cold creams, and so on. It is said that the value of cosmetics is proportional to the content of musk essence. Musk contains a chemical component called muscone - commonly known as musk essence, which is highly volatile and has a good fixative effect. It can make the fragrance in cosmetics more fragrant, rich, and lasting, so musk has become one of the important raw materials in the fragrance chemical industry. Although, there is now chemically synthesized "artificial musk," its fixative effect is far inferior to natural musk.
    What exactly is musk? According to biologists, musk is a secretion from the glandular sac under the navel of the male musk deer. Its function is to emit a special fragrance to attract female musk deer, just like other male animals use beautiful feathers or melodious calls for courtship. Musk is a sebaceous powder in the musk sac, varying in size, with toughness and richness in oil. When fresh, it is relatively moist, generally dark red in color, with a strong and pungent aroma that lasts for a long time. The capacity of musk in each musk sac can reach up to one tael.
    The musk deer is a small animal of the deer family, weighing only one-tenth of a sika deer. It is about 50 cm tall and 80-90 cm long, with cloven hooves and no horns. The male has a pair of fangs about 6-7 cm long in the upper jaw. The whole body is covered with coarse, brownish-brown hair. Musk deer are widely distributed. They are found in the Himalayas, the northwest, Inner Mongolia to the Greater Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains in the northeast, and the Miao and Yao Mountains in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. However, the main producing area of musk is on the Kangzang Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," on the edge of the primeval forests in the high mountains. Musk deer are good at running and jumping, feeding on mosses, grasses, leaves, and young branches. In the producing areas, musk deer are commonly called "獐子" (獐子).
    The production of musk now relies on hunters killing male musk deer, cutting off their musk sacs, and then extracting the musk from the sacs when needed. The hunting methods include: shooting with guns and crossbows, trapping with snares, or chasing with hunting dogs. In hunting, hunters indiscriminately kill males and females, old and young, whether they have musk or not. The annual output of musk in the country is estimated to be four thousand catties, with an average of thirty musk sacs per catty. This means that twelve thousand male musk deer with musk are killed each year, and with the addition of female and young musk deer, the number is no less than two to three hundred thousand. This passive and massive indiscriminate killing is causing great damage to this important national specialty. This is a problem that deserves attention. (Attached picture)

    麝香和麝
    庄学本
    麝香是我国著名的特产之一，我国麝香的产量和质量在世界上都占第一位。麝香的价值比黄金还贵，每两一百多元。
    在中药里，麝香是一味用途比较广泛的药物。在许多出名的特效成药里都不能缺少麝香。中医常用的成药中，有几十种都必须用它。关于麝香在医疗上的功效，我国明朝大医药家李时珍在“本草纲目”里说：“通诸窍，开经络，透肌骨，解酒毒，消瓜果食积，治中风、中气、中恶、痰厥、积聚症瘕”。民间传说它能“避孕”、“堕胎”、“辟蛇”。
    在作为香料的应用上，我国在一千多年以前已经有用麝香和草木香来粉饰墙壁、熏衣服、或炼成小丸子含在口中的。近代世界各国也用它来制造高贵的香水、香粉、雪花膏等等。据说化妆品的价值以含麝香精的成分为比例。麝香含有一种化学成分叫做麝香酮——俗称麝香精，它的挥发性很大而且富有定香的作用，它能够使化妆品中的香气更加芬芳馥郁耐久，因此麝香就成为香料化学工业中重要原料之一。虽然，现在已有化学仿制的“人造麝香”，但是它的定香作用远不如天然麝香。
    麝香究竟是一种什么东西？据生物学家的研究，麝香是雄麝脐下腺囊中的一种分泌物，它的作用在散射异香，引诱雌麝，正像其他雄性动物或者以美丽的毛羽，或者以悦耳的鸣声起着的求偶作用。麝香是麝香囊中一种皮脂状的粉粒，大小不一，有韧性，富油质，新鲜时比较潮润，颜色一般作酱红色，香气浓郁刺鼻，经久不散，每个香囊中麝香的容量最多的可达一市两。
    麝是鹿科的一种小动物，体重仅及一头梅花鹿的十分之一，体高约50厘米，体长约80—90厘米，偶蹄，无角，雄性上颚有一对长约6—7厘米的獠牙，全身粗毛作棕褐色。麝的分布地区很广，我国喜马拉雅山，西北、内蒙到东北的大兴安岭、长白山，云南、贵州到广西的大苗山、大瑶山都有出产。但是麝的主要产地在号称“世界屋脊”的康藏高原上，拔海很高的深山里的原始森林的边缘。麝善于奔跳，以藓苔草类和树叶、嫩枝等为食料。麝在产地都通称叫“獐子”。
    麝香的生产，现在是靠猎人捕杀雄麝割下它的香囊，用时再从囊中取出麝香。猎捕的方法：有用枪弩射杀，有用活索绊扣或猎狗追捕。猎人在狩猎中，不分公母老幼、有香无香，一律加以捕杀。全国麝香的年产量估计为四千斤，每斤平均为香囊三十个，则每年被杀的带麝香的雄麝就有十二万头，再加上雌麝和幼麝就不下二三十万头。这种消极的大量的滥杀，给这项祖国重要特产带来很大的损失。这是一个值得重视的问题。（附图片）
