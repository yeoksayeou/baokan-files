Responses to Criticism

    Guarantee Importance to Order Contracts
    A letter from the local state-owned Shenyang Small Switch Factory states: The article "When Will Delivery Be On Time?" published in the People's Daily on July 4th, which criticized our factory for delayed delivery, is correct. After accepting an order from the Beijing People's Machine Factory, our factory did not actively seek solutions due to some difficulties in production arrangements. Instead, we commissioned a handicraft production cooperative to do the work, but the products they produced were all substandard. Later, we transferred the work to the Chunxing Low-Voltage Switch Factory, by which time the contractually stipulated delivery date had already passed. The Beijing People's Machine Factory sent people to our factory several times to urge delivery. Only then did our factory convene technical personnel to start trial production, delivering twenty units at one time. The remaining units were again entrusted to the Chunxing Low-Voltage Switch Factory, which did not complete the delivery until June 26th. The main reason for this phenomenon is that our factory lacked an overall perspective and did not attach enough importance to order contracts, excessively emphasizing difficulties. We also lacked supervision and inspection of the commissioned external factory production, resulting in delayed delivery, which affected the needs and installation of the fraternal factory. Through this lesson, our factory guarantees that it will attach importance to order contracts in the future and prevent similar situations from happening again.

    Preparing to Absorb a Large Number of Trade Union Members
    A letter from the trade union organization committee of the Anhui Bengbu China Sugar and Pastry Company states: The article "Why Not Let Them Join the Trade Union?" published in the People's Daily on August 5th is a correct criticism of us. In the past, there was indeed a tendency toward closed-doorism in our work. We did not pay attention to trade union organizational work, kept workers outside the door, and affected their enthusiasm. Recently, we went to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for study and criticized this idea. We are preparing to absorb all eligible employees into the trade union organization.

    Housing Has Been Allocated According to Needs
    A letter from the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau states: The letter from reader Zhao Changqing published in the People's Daily on August 5th, criticizing our bureau for "leaving houses empty instead of giving them to employees," is largely true. The Heiyugou dormitory did retain a considerable number of houses, and for a certain period, there were indeed more than forty empty rooms that were not allocated to employees. Our way of thinking, work style, and the system itself have shortcomings and errors. We announced at the joint meeting of factory and mine directors on August 9th that the method of centralized distribution by the bureau would be changed to a decentralized system, and the method of distribution according to work type and work grade would be changed to distribution according to the urgency of needs, and that technical personnel, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and advanced producers would be taken care of under the same circumstances.

    However, what Comrade Zhao Changqing said, "The houses we have built over the years are sufficient for the number of employees," is not consistent with the facts. We are an expanding unit, and the number of people is constantly increasing. At present, the public housing that has been built, the self-built public-assisted housing, plus the private housing of employees and rental housing, can only solve the housing problem for 54% of the employees, so the housing shortage problem is serious.

### 对批评的反应

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    保证重视订货合同
    地方国营沈阳小型开关厂来信说：7月4日人民日报发表“什么时候才能按期交货”一文，批评我厂误期交货，是正确的。我厂在接受北京人民机器厂订货后，由于安排生产上有些困难，没有积极设法解决，就委托手工业生产合作社去做，但是他们所制出的产品都不合格；后来又转到春兴低压开关厂生产，这时已超过了合同规定的交货的日期。北京人民机器厂几次派人来我厂催货，我厂才召集技术人员动手试制，一次交了二十台；剩下的台数，又委托给春兴低压开关厂了。春兴厂一直拖到6月26日才交完。产生这种现象的原因，主要是我厂缺乏整体观念，对订货合同重视不够，过份强调困难；委托外厂生产也缺乏督促和检查，以致脱期交货，影响兄弟厂的需要和安装。通过这次教训，我厂保证在今后重视订货合同，杜绝再发生类似情况。
    准备大量吸收工会会员
    安徽蚌埠市中国糖业糕点公司工会组织委员来信说：8月5日人民日报发表“为什么不让他们加入工会”一文，对我们的批评是正确的。我们过去工作中的确存在着关门主义，不重视工会组织工作，把工人关在门外，影响了他们的积极性。最近，我们到市工会进行了学习，批判了这种思想，准备把够条件的职工都吸收到工会组织中来。
    已按需要分配住宅
    杨家杖子矿务局来信说：8月5日人民日报发表读者赵长青的来信，批评我局“空着房子不给职工住”，我们认为绝大部分是事实。黑鱼沟宿舍曾经保留相当数量的房子，并在一定时期内确有过四十多间空房，没有分配给职工住。我们的思想方法、工作作风和制度本身都是有缺点和错误的。我们已于8月9日厂矿长联席会上公布：关于房子问题，把由局集中分配的办法改为分权制，把按工种和工作等级分配的方法改为根据需要的轻重缓急分配，并在同样的情况下照顾技术人员、转业复员军人和先进生产者。
    但赵长青同志所说“我们几年来所建的房屋，按职工人数计算满可以够用”是与事实不符的。我们是扩建单位，人数不断增加，目前已建成的公房、自建公助房、加上职工私有房和租赁房都算在内，只能解决54％的职工的住房问题，所以房荒的问题是严重地存在着的。
