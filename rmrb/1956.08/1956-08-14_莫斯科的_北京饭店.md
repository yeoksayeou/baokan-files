    The "Beijing Restaurant" in Moscow
    By Hu Sisheng, our correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Chinese people who have been to Moscow or lived there for a long time all know about the "Beijing Restaurant," because sitting there, picking up chopsticks, and tasting a few Chinese dishes really has the flavor of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land." Now, walking into the "Beijing Restaurant," you can not only see Chinese and Russians, but also hear Ukrainian, Armenian, French, and German, which seems like an "international restaurant."

    This is not accidental. Comrade Siglov, the restaurant manager, said: "Everyone knows that Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest cuisines in the world. Chinese food has been recognized in Moscow. Muscovites and visitors from other places give good reviews to the variety of exquisite and delicious Chinese dishes." Then, he seemed to express regretfully: Chinese people can make a total of three thousand kinds of dishes, but now we can only prepare two hundred and fifty kinds for the time being. But he added that the variety of dishes will gradually expand.

    The raw materials for the Chinese dishes at the "Beijing Restaurant," except for fish, meat, and chicken, which are sourced locally, such as bird's nest, sea cucumber, shark fin, shrimp, and kelp are regularly transported by plane or the "Beijing-Moscow" direct express train. Interestingly, the Orekhovo-Zuyevo State Farm in the suburbs of Moscow specifically raises the raw materials for "Beijing roast duck"—Beijing ducks—according to special methods for the restaurant.

    There are ten Chinese chefs here, led by chef Wang Yongliang, who not only personally cook but also lead the "Chinese Cooking Art Training Class." Eight Soviet chefs have already completed their studies, and now there are eighteen Moscow youths learning how to make two hundred and fifty kinds of Chinese dishes under their tutelage. We have heard that Moscow housewives also frequently write to the restaurant to inquire about how to make Chinese dishes at home. Perhaps no one will inquire in the future, because Vasilyev, a Soviet chef with thirty years of cooking experience, after working with Chinese chefs for a considerable period, has written a booklet entitled "250 Kinds of Chinese Cooking Art," and according to him, this booklet is not only understandable to experts, but also to ordinary housewives. It is said that this booklet will be published in both Chinese and Russian in Beijing and Moscow.

    Soon, the "Beijing Restaurant" will move from its current location on Petrovka to its new home (this is its third move; it was originally in Gorky Park), echoing the "Beijing Hotel" on Mayakovsky Square, which recently opened in Moscow.

### 莫斯科的“北京饭店”

    莫斯科的“北京饭店”
    本报驻苏联记者　胡思升
    到过莫斯科或是长期住在莫斯科的中国人都知道“北京饭店”，因为坐在那里拿起筷子尝几个中国菜，确实有点“他乡遇故知”的风味。现在走进“北京饭店”，不仅能看见中国人和俄罗斯人，而且可以听见乌克兰话、亚美尼亚话、法国话和德国话，似乎有点“国际饭店”的景象了。
    这不是偶然的。饭店经理席格洛夫同志说：“大家知道中国烹调术是世界上最古老的烹调术之一。中国菜已经在莫斯科得到公认。莫斯科人和外地来客对各式各样的、精致可口的中国菜给以很好的评价。”接着他好像是有点遗憾地表示：中国人总共会做三千种菜，可是现在我们暂时只能准备二百五十种。不过他又补充说，菜的品种是会慢慢扩大的。
    “北京饭店”中国菜的原料，除鱼、肉和鸡是采自本地外，其他如燕窝、海参、鱼翅、虾、海带等都定期由飞机或“北京—莫斯科”直达快车运来。有意思的是，莫斯科近郊的奥列霍夫—佐也夫国营农场特为饭店按照特殊的方法喂养“北京烤鸭”的原料——北京鸭。
    这里有十个中国厨师，厨师长是王永良，他们不仅亲自下手，而且领导了“中国烹调艺术训练班”，已经有八个苏联厨师修业完毕，现在还有十八个莫斯科青年在他们手下学习如何做二百五十种中国菜。我们听说，莫斯科的家庭主妇也经常写信给饭店，打听怎样在家庭条件下做中国菜。将来也许就没有人会来打听了，因为有三十年烹调经验的苏联厨师长华西里也夫在跟中国厨师一起工作了相当时期以后，已经写了一本题为“中国烹调术250种”的小册子，而且据他说，这本小册子不仅专家能了解，而且普通的家庭主妇也能看懂。据说，这本小册子将用中文、俄文在北京和莫斯科两地出版。
    不久以后，“北京饭店”将从现在的彼得洛夫卡“乔迁”到新居（这是它的第三次迁居，它最先是在高尔基公园内），同不久前在莫斯科开幕的位于马雅可夫斯基广场的“北京旅馆”相互辉映。
