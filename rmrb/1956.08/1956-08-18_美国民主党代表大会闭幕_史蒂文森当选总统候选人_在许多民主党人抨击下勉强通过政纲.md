Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, August 17th: Former Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson was again nominated as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention on August 16th. He was first elected as the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952.

The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to conclude today after electing the vice-presidential candidate and hearing acceptance speeches from the presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

The convention yesterday also passed the policy platform proposed by the party's platform committee. According to Reuters, this platform has been criticized by many Democrats. They believe that if the Democratic Party wins the election this year, this platform will put the future Democratic government in a serious dilemma in international affairs. The news said that when the foreign policy platform was read out at the conference yesterday, most of the delegates were excitedly discussing the controversial civil rights platform.
