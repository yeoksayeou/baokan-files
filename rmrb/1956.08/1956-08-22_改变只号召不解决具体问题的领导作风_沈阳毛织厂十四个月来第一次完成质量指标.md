Changing the Leadership Style of Only Calling for Action Without Solving Specific Problems
Shenyang Woolen Mill Completes Quality Target for the First Time in Fourteen Months

(Our Newspaper) Shenyang News – For the first time in fourteen months, the Shenyang Woolen Mill completed its product quality target in July. This achievement was obtained after improving the working style under the leadership of the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the factory.

In the advanced producer movement, the General Branch noticed that the quality of products had not improved. Even reducing the quality target from 80% to 70% could not be achieved. So, they organized an investigation team and instructed the administration to study the product quality situation together. The investigation found that the leadership only called on employees to improve quality, but did not discover and solve the problems that affected quality improvement. Instead, when the quality was poor, they blamed the workers or complained among the cadres. For example, there was a lack of necessary technical backbones, resulting in poor maintenance of the machines, and no manpower was allocated; the machines lacked steel boxes, jacquard cards, and warps, and the warping machine lacked materials, but no one bought them; these all affected the quality of textiles. Many workers had experience in improving quality, but it was not summarized and promoted, and the technical level of many workers could not be improved; the standards of advanced producers lacked quality standards, and the rewards only focused on production achievements.

Based on these situations, the General Branch convened an enlarged meeting in early May for discussion. At the meeting, they criticized the leadership style of only calling for action without solving specific problems and made a resolution to take measures to improve product quality. After the meeting, the leadership style greatly changed. The administration immediately conducted a comprehensive overhaul of the fine spinning looms in the weaving factory, adjusted and allocated eighteen technicians and workers, and strengthened the maintenance backbone. The sales and supply department purchased steel boxes and other machine materials from Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, and other places, solving the key problems of improving product quality from the equipment aspect. At the same time, they also improved the quality responsibility system from the management aspect, and organized the inspection department to go to the workshops to help solve various specific problems in quality. The trade union summarized and promoted thirty-two experiences in improving quality; established a high-quality technical training class to teach technical methods for improving quality, formulated quality standards for advanced producers, and rewarded 302 employees who improved quality.

Due to the change in leadership style and the solution of many specific problems, the factory completed the quality targets of various products for the first time in fourteen months in July. Among them, the completion rate of various gabardines was only 47% in the first quarter, but increased to 95.4% in July. Sixty-one advanced producers of excellent quality emerged throughout the factory. In July, the factory comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks.

### 改变只号召不解决具体问题的领导作风  沈阳毛织厂十四个月来第一次完成质量指标

    改变只号召不解决具体问题的领导作风
    沈阳毛织厂十四个月来第一次完成质量指标
    本报讯　沈阳毛织厂十四个月来头一次在七月份完成了产品的质量指标。这个成绩是在这个厂的中共总支委员会领导下改进工作作风以后所获得的。
    总支在先进生产者运动中注意到产品质量一直没有好转，甚至把质量指标由80％降低到70％也还不能达到，便组织了一个调查小组，并且责成行政一起研究产品的质量情况。调查结果发现，领导只是号召职工提高质量，而不去发现和解决那些影响质量提高的问题，质量不好，反而埋怨工人或者干部间互相抱怨。比如缺少必要的技术骨干，使机台保全保养不好，没有调配人力；机台上缺少钢箱、布卡子、经轴，整经机缺少机物材料，没人去给购买；这些都影响纺织品的质量。工人中有很多提高质量的经验，也没有总结推广，很多工人的技术水平不能提高；先进生产者的标准里缺少质量标准，奖励也只注意产量方面的成绩。
    根据这些情况，总支于五月上旬召开了扩大会进行讨论，会上批判了那种只号召不解决具体问题的领导作风，作出了采取措施提高产品质量的决议。会后，领导作风有很大转变。行政立即对机织厂的精纺织布机进行一次全面大检修，调整配备了十八名技术人员和职工，充实了保全保养的骨干。供销科到上海、天津、大连等地购买钢箱等机物材料，从设备方面解决了提高产品质量的关键问题。同时，又从管理上健全了质量责任制度，组织检查科到车间去帮助解决质量中的各种具体问题。工会总结推广了三十二种提高质量的经验；成立了优等质量技术训练班，讲授改进质量的技术方法，制订了先进生产者的质量标准，奖励了302名改进质量的职工。
    由于领导作风的转变，许多具体问题得到解决，七月份，全厂十四个月来第一次完成了各种产品的质量指标，其中各种哔叽，第一季度只完成质量指标的47％，七月份提高到95.4％。全厂涌现了六十一名优等质量的先进生产者。七月份，全厂全面超额完成了生产任务。
