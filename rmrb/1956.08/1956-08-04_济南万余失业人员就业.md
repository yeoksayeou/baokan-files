    Over 10,000 Unemployed People in Jinan Find Employment
    (Our dispatch) This first half of this year, 10,097 unemployed people in Jinan City, allocated through the labor departments, have participated in national construction, exceeding the total number of people employed last year by more than ten times.
    Among these newly employed people, some were unemployed people left over from the old society. In the past, they lacked skills and education. After liberation, many of them worked as temporary workers and attended spare-time schools, gaining basic skills in construction, machinery, cooking, and other areas. As a result, they were able to obtain permanent jobs this year when various construction projects in different regions needed a large number of workers. Another group consisted of students who did not advance to higher education after graduating from primary or junior high school last year. After finding employment, these people showed great enthusiasm for participating in the country's construction. Most of them were assigned to places like Xinjiang, Yumen, Baotou, and the Northeast.

    济南万余失业人员就业
    本报讯　今年上半年，济南市通过劳动部门调配的10，097名无业失业人员参加了国家建设事业，超过去年就业人员总数十倍多。
    这批就业人员中，有一部分是旧社会遗留下来的失业人员，在过去他们没有技术和文化，解放后，很多人当过临时工，进了业余学校，初步掌握了建筑、机械、做饭等技术，因而在今年各地建设工程需要大批人员的时候获得了固定的职业；还有一部分是去年没有升学的高小和初中毕业的学生。这些人就业后，参加祖国各种建设的热情非常高涨，他们大部分被分配到新疆、玉门、包头和东北等地。
