Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 5th - Due to continuous rainfall and excessive water, many sections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway's roadbed in western Hebei Province have experienced water immersion and overflow, causing temporary interruptions to transportation. Currently, farmers and railway employees along the line are bravely draining water, repairing, and protecting the roadbed to maintain railway transportation.

After the roadbed in Yuanshi and other counties south of Shijiazhuang was damaged by floodwaters, responsible cadres from the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shijiazhuang Administrative Office immediately rushed to the aforementioned locations to lead railway employees and farmers in emergency repairs in the rain. On the afternoon of the 3rd, more than 30 breaches occurred in the roadbed between Yujiazhuang and Xiaosai Railway Stations. The Baoding Railway Station immediately dispatched 270 employees to carry out emergency repairs. At noon on the 4th, a bridge north of Baoding was damaged by floodwaters. Railway employees, farmers along the line, and local garrison troops worked together to repair the bridge in a short time.

    京汉路沿线农民和员工冒雨维护铁路交通
    据新华社保定5日电　由于连日降雨，雨水过大，河北省西部地区京汉铁路多处路基发生浸水漫水现象，交通一度中断。现在，沿路农民和铁路员工正冒雨排水抢修和防护路基，维护铁路交通。
    石家庄以南元氏等县路基被雨水冲毁后，中共石家庄地委和石家庄专署的负责干部立即赶到上述地点，领导铁路员工和农民冒雨抢修。三日下午，于家庄和小赛车站之间路基曾被河水冲开三十多处，保定车站立即调拨二百七十名员工前去抢救。四日中午，保定以北有一处桥梁被大水冲坏，铁路员工、沿线农民和当地驻军同心协力，没有多久就把桥梁修好。
