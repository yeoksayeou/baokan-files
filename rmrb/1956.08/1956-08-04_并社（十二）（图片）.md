Merger of Cooperatives (12)
Adapted by: Tu Honghen Illustrated by: Jiang Ying
(Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shu Ming and Ying Hua")
45. Deputy Secretary Ma said: "Shu Ming, is it that you have become a little arrogant after receiving some praise? Some people have reported that you are using high-handed words to suppress people, and your father said in the club that the merger of the cooperatives is the Second Cooperative exploiting you..." Shu Ming felt a little aggrieved upon hearing this. Li Baichuan's face also turned red.
46. Shu Ming's heart suddenly cleared: "Deputy Secretary Ma, whether it's my fault or my father's fault, I can admit it. If anyone dislikes me, I am willing to support someone else as the director, as long as the two cooperatives merge and the advanced cooperative is successfully established, I have no second thoughts in my heart..."
47. Shu Ming's eyes were a little wet, but he turned to Li Baichuan with a smile and said: "Director Li, we must unite and wholeheartedly support the establishment of the advanced cooperative. Let's not listen to the words of bad people!..." Deputy Secretary Ma was deeply moved.
48. Li Baichuan was like someone who had suffered a fierce artillery bombardment, and he collapsed all of a sudden. He felt that his plan for today was over, so he sneered twice, made the excuse that there was still a meeting in the cooperative, and hurriedly went out.

    45　马副书记说：“树明，是不是你受了些表扬，有点骄傲啦？有人反映你拿大话压人，你爹在俱乐部说并社是二社剥削你们。……”树明一听，感到有些委屈。李百川的脸也涨得通红。
    46　树明心里一下子豁亮了：“马副书记，不管是我的过或是我爹的过，我都可以承认，如果有人嫌我不好，我情愿拥护别人当主任，只要两个社合并，高级社办得成，我打心眼里没二话。……”
    47　树明眼里有些湿，但笑着转身向李百川说：“李主任，咱们得团结一心拢着捧着地把高级社办成。咱别听坏人的话！……”马副书记听得深深地感动了。
    48　李百川像遭了一阵猛烈炮火，一下子折倒了。他感到他今天的打算是完蛋了，便冷笑两声，推说社里还有个会议，慌忙出门去了。
