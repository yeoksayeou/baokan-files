    Protesting the Persecution of the German Communist Party
    Liu Ningyi
    As the international situation is definitely trending towards relaxation, and the West German people's movement against the revival of militarism and demanding the peaceful reunification of Germany is rising, the Adenauer government, in close collusion with the American ruling clique, has openly declared the German Communist Party illegal. This is a serious incident opposing the cause of peace and democracy, and an act of trampling on the basic democratic rights and freedoms of the German people. The Adenauer government has brutally violated the unanimous decision of the anti-Hitler countries during World War II to democratize Germany.
    In recent years, the international tension has gradually eased, and the idea of peaceful coexistence has taken root in the hearts of the people. This development has seriously frustrated the war schemes of international reactionary forces and West German revanchists. This unreasonable measure by the Adenauer government is the beginning of their anti-peace conspiracy to intensify international tension and undermine the trend of peaceful coexistence. They know that the German Communist Party has always been the most resolute force in the West German people's struggle against war, against division, against re-militarization, and for the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Therefore, they are eager to eliminate the Communist Party, attempting to strengthen the fascist rule in West Germany, accelerate militarization, and aggravate the internal tensions in Germany, in order to deepen the division of Germany, so that a hotbed of war can be formed again in the heart of Europe.
    The Adenauer government's banning of the West German Communist Party is an attempt to prevent the West German people from expressing their opinions and engaging in activities on the issue of peaceful reunification of Germany, making it impossible to restore the unity of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy.
    After Hitler suppressed the German Communist Party in 1933, he immediately suppressed other parties and organizations of the German working class, placing Germany under the strict rule of fascist bandits and launching World War II. The Adenauer government's banning of the Communist Party is following Hitler's old path, a prelude to a further attack on the entire working class organizations and all peaceful, democratic, and progressive forces in West Germany, and a further threat to world peace. This cannot but arouse the resolute opposition of the German working class and people, and cannot but arouse the serious protest of the Chinese working class and the working class of the world.
    In German history, reactionary ruling groups have more than once used suppression to destroy the German working-class movement and the democratic and peace movement, in order to prepare and launch wars. But it was these reactionary ruling groups themselves that were destroyed, while the German working class marched forward with more determined steps. After World War II, the birth and increasing consolidation of the German Democratic Republic, a strong fortress for the German people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, has made it more difficult for the anti-peace and democratic schemes of international war forces and West German militarist forces to succeed.
    The German people have increasingly realized the serious danger contained in the Adenauer government's attempt to follow Hitler's path and eliminate the Communist Party. They have taken action to oppose this suppression measure and demand the restoration of the German Communist Party's legal rights. The Chinese working class, together with the working class of the world, firmly supports this just struggle of the German people. We believe that the German working class, by uniting its ranks and uniting all peace-loving and democratic forces in the country to fight, will surely achieve final victory. We firmly believe that "the German Communist Party still exists and will continue to exist." Victory will forever belong to the advancing working class and the people.

    抗议迫害德国共产党
    刘宁一
    正当国际局势肯定趋向缓和，西德人民反对复活军国主义、要求和平统一德国的运动日益高涨的今天，和美国统治集团密切勾结的阿登纳政府竟公然宣布德国共产党为非法。这是一件严重的反对和平民主事业的事件，是一件蹂躏德国人民基本民主权利和自由的行为。阿登纳政府粗暴地破坏了第二次世界大战期间反希特勒各国使德国民主化的一致的决定。
    近年来，国际紧张局势逐步缓和，和平共处的思想日益深入人心，这一发展严重地挫败了国际反动势力和西德复仇主义者的战争阴谋。阿登纳政府这一蛮横无理的措施，就是他们为了加剧国际紧张局势，破坏和平共处的趋势而实行的反和平阴谋的开始。他们知道，德国共产党始终是西德人民为反对战争、反对分裂、反对重新军国主义化、为要求建立独立、统一、民主和爱好和平的德国而斗争的最坚决的力量。因此他们急于要消灭共产党，企图借此加强西德的法西斯统治，加紧军国主义化，加剧德国内部的紧张局势，以加深德国的分裂，从而能够在欧洲中心地带再度形成一个战争的温床。
    阿登纳政府取缔西德共产党，是企图使西德人民不敢就和平统一德国问题发表意见和进行活动，使得在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一成为不可能。
    希特勒在1933年镇压了德国共产党以后，随即镇压了德国工人阶级的其他政党和组织，将德国放在法西斯匪徒的严密统治之下并发动了第二次世界大战。阿登纳政府取缔共产党，就是走希特勒的老路，是进一步向西德整个工人阶级的组织和一切和平、民主、进步力量进攻的前奏，是进一步威胁世界和平的行为。这不能不引起德国工人阶级和人民的坚决反对，也不能不引起中国工人阶级和全世界工人阶级的严重抗议。
    在德国历史上，反动统治集团曾不止一次地以镇压手段来摧残德国的工人阶级运动和民主和平运动，以准备和发动战争。但是被毁灭的却是这些反动统治集团本身，德国工人阶级却以更坚定的步伐向前迈进。第二次世界大战后，德国人民为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的坚强堡垒德意志民主共和国的诞生并且日益巩固，这一事实，使得国际战争势力和西德军国主义势力的反和平民主的阴谋更难得逞。
    德国人民已日益认识到阿登纳政府重走希特勒的道路，企图消灭共产党这一行动所包含的严重危险。他们已经纷纷行动起来，反对这一镇压措施，要求恢复德国共产党的合法权利。中国工人阶级和全世界工人阶级一起，坚决支持德国人民的这一正义斗争。我们相信，德国工人阶级团结自己的队伍、联合国内一切和平民主力量起来进行奋斗，一定能够取得最后的胜利。我们坚信，“德国共产党仍然存在，并且将继续存在下去”。胜利是永远属于前进着的工人阶级和人民的。
