Shenyang, August 23rd (Shenyang Daily) – In the inter-factory, inter-workshop competition, the machining and casting workshops of twenty state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang have launched technical mutual assistance, extensively summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences, which has continuously improved product quality and solved technical problems that have existed in some units for a long time.

    Shenyang Medical Equipment Factory began trial-producing refrigerators in the fourth quarter of 1954. However, due to the high noise of the motor and shrinkage cavities in the cylinder block, mass production could not be achieved for a long time. During the competition, the Air Compressor Factory, Transformer Factory, and High-Voltage Switch Factory dispatched technical personnel and equipment to provide support, and the above technical problems were quickly resolved. The refrigerators needed by many departments began mass production in August. In order to eliminate the shrinkage cavities in the refrigerator cylinder block, the casting workshop of the Air Compressor Factory helped with manufacturing and sent the workshop director and two technicians to the Medical Equipment Factory on rest days for technical guidance. The Fifth Workshop of the Third Machine Tool Factory frequently produced defective products in the first quarter and failed to complete its production tasks. In the second quarter, with the help of the casting workshop of the Second Machine Tool Factory, it overfulfilled the main indicators, and the defective product rate was reduced from 9% to 7.18%. In the past, when a factory encountered technical difficulties, it had to solve them on its own or request assistance from higher authorities, which often took a lot of time.

    During the inter-factory, inter-workshop competition in the second quarter, the industrial trade union also organized a group of technical personnel to conduct roving inspections of the processing and casting workshops of various factories, summarizing and exchanging various experiences. In this quarter, one hundred and fifty-two kinds of small experiences were summarized, and the existing major advanced experiences were further disseminated.

    As a result of the above activities, according to statistics from twenty-eight machining workshops, the product quality of twenty-four workshops in the second quarter was improved compared with the first quarter; according to statistics from sixteen casting workshops, the defective product rate of ten workshops was lower than that of the first quarter.

    沈阳许多工厂实行技术互助
    本报讯　沈阳市二十个国营机械工厂的机械加工车间和铸造车间，在厂际同车间竞赛中，开展了技术互助，广泛总结和交流先进经验，使得产品质量不断提高，并且解决了某些单位长期存在的技术问题。
    沈阳医疗器械厂从1954年第四季度开始试制电冰箱，但是，由于电机噪音大、气缸体出缩孔，很长时期没能大批生产。在竞赛中，空气压缩机厂、变压器厂、高压开关厂抽出了技术力量和设备予以支援，上述技术问题很快地得到解决，许多部门所需要的电冰箱八月份就开始大批生产了。为了消除电冰箱气缸体的缩孔，空气压缩机厂铸造车间曾帮助制造，并且派车间主任和两名技术员在休息日到医疗器械厂进行技术指导。第三机床厂五车间第一季度经常出废品，完不成生产任务，第二季度经第二机床厂铸造车间的帮助，超额完成了主要指标，废品率从9％降低到7.18％，过去一个工厂发生了技术困难，是只好自己解决或请求上级帮助解决，往往耽误很多时间。
    在第二季度的厂际同车间竞赛中，产业工会还组织了一批技术力量，分别到各厂的加工和铸造车间去巡回检查，总结交流各种经验。在这一个季度中总结的点滴经验就有一百五十二种，并进一步传播了既有的重大先进经验。
    由于进行了上述活动，据二十八个机械加工车间的统计，第二季度就有二十四个车间的产品质量较第一季度提高；据十六个铸造车间的统计，就有十个车间的废品率比第一季度降低。　（沈阳日报）
