Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The State Council recently allocated another 29 million yuan to relieve people in Anhui, Henan, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces affected by floods and droughts. This is the third allocation made by the State Council since the beginning of summer. The first allocation was on June 18th, totaling 7.5 million yuan. At that time, the Huai River areas of Anhui and Henan provinces, and individual areas of Hebei province, had just experienced waterlogging caused by heavy rain, and this sum was used for emergency relief. The second allocation was on July 11th, totaling 13.7 million yuan. In addition to continuing to relieve the people in the Huai River areas of Anhui and Henan provinces who were heavily affected by rain and waterlogging, it also provided relief to people in some areas of Jiangsu affected by rain and waterlogging, and to people in some areas of Gansu and Guangxi affected by drought and hail.

In order to quickly help people in disaster areas solve their living difficulties and support them in their production efforts, the State Council recently decided on a third allocation. The total amount of the three allocations since the beginning of summer is 50.2 million yuan. This is a great concern of the state for the people in disaster areas.

The provinces that have suffered from floods and droughts have now launched disaster relief work, and the comrades from the Ministry of Internal Affairs who were sent to Anhui, Henan and other provinces to inspect the disaster situation have also returned to Beijing.

    为了迅速帮助灾区人民解决生活困难，支持他们搞好生产，国务院最近又决定了第三次拨款。入夏以来先后三次拨款总额是五千零二十万元。这是国家对灾区人民的巨大关怀。
    遭受水旱灾害的各省，现在已经开展了救灾工作，内务部派往安徽、河南等省视察灾情的工作同志也已经返回北京。
