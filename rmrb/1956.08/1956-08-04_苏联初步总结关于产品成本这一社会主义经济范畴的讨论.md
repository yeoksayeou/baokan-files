    Preliminary Soviet Summary of Discussions on the Socialist Economic Category of Product Cost
    Sun Yaojun
    The Soviet economic circles' discussion on the socialist economic category of product cost, which this newspaper previously introduced (see page 3 of this newspaper on June 12, 1956), has been initially summarized by M. Shakov in the Soviet journal "Economic Issues." Now, we will briefly introduce this preliminary summary regarding the several issues discussed last time.
    First, what is the economic essence of product cost? What is the relationship between product cost and the socially necessary expenditure of producing the product?
    Regarding this issue, M. Shakov agrees with the first opinion, which is that product cost, in its economic essence, is determined by the socially necessary expenditure of producing the product, and its foundation is the value of the product, i.e., the socially necessary consumption. He pointed out: "In the process of product reproduction, a portion of the product must be put forward in the form of social funds to compensate for the means of production and the means of subsistence of production personnel that have been consumed. This is a necessary condition for the cyclical repetition of each new production cycle. This objective process is to extract the first two parts of value (the value of the means of production consumed and the value for one's own product) and list them as the basis of cost." And "value is the general expression of the amount of social labor (past labor and living labor) consumed embodied in the product."
    However, he also believes that product cost does not depend entirely on the socially necessary consumption of producing the product, and also depends on some actual expenses incurred in the production and circulation of the product that do not belong to socially necessary consumption. Regarding this issue, he elaborates in more detail below.
    Second, what does product cost include? Does product cost include non-productive expenditures?
    Regarding this issue, M. Shakov believes that non-productive expenditures are included in the product cost, which makes the role of product cost even greater. He believes that this does not contradict the aforementioned statement that the basis of product cost is value, i.e., socially necessary consumption. Because product cost is the monetary form of value, it may deviate from its value basis. He pointed out: "The various elements of circulation expenses included in the full cost, like some other expenses outside of production (various fines, product shortages and damages, etc.), do not belong to the product value formation process, but like all production expenses, they are compensated by value. Some people will ask: Is this consistent with the above definition that cost is a part of value? Yes, it is consistent. As pointed out earlier, cost is not simply a part of value, but its monetary form. This monetary amount may deviate from its value basis under different specific conditions of operation and management."
    He criticized those who believe that product cost does not include non-productive expenditures, saying: "Some economists believe that since cost is a part of value, cost should only include pure production expenses. This view does not proceed from actual life, but from an incorrect interpretation of theoretical formulas. Even completely correct theoretical formulas can only reflect the essence of various phenomena and cannot include all the complex and varied specific phenomena. Practical life is much richer than any theoretical formula. Therefore, the changes that practical life brings to the specific content of cost cannot be discarded because they do not conform to theoretical formulas."
    Third, does departmental average cost (social cost) exist? From what perspective should the issue of product cost be examined?
    M. Shakov believes that departmental average cost (social cost) exists. He believes that the issue of product cost should not only be viewed from the perspective of the enterprise, but also from the perspective of society. The reason why product cost takes the form of production cost of each enterprise is only due to the economic accounting system. He said: "Cost is not the production cost of private enterprises, but the production cost of socialist enterprises (public property). Therefore, it indicates in monetary terms how much money society spends on producing products. However, because socialist enterprises are operated according to the principle of economic accounting, the cost must take the form of the production cost of each enterprise."
    He further pointed out that product cost cannot be regarded as a category within a national economic sector; instead, it should be regarded as a "national economic category." He said: "Obviously, it is completely wrong to say that cost is only related to a certain national economic sector, such as only to industry. This is fundamentally inconsistent with the facts and has no theoretical basis. Cost as a national economic category actually exists. In addition to the cost of industrial products, there are also the cost of agricultural products (collective farms and state farms), the cost of tractor work of machine tractor stations, transportation costs, construction and installation costs, etc."
    Fourth, how is the cost of a product determined? What role does the socialist state play in the determination of cost?
    M. Shakov believes that the objective basis of product cost is the value of the product, i.e., socially necessary consumption, but the socialist state can adjust and plan it, and sometimes there are often economically unfounded situations in the actual cost plan. He believes that "price, cost, and social net income (expressed through currency) are the specific forms of value used in practice, i.e., socialist planned management. The socialist state stipulates a certain proportional relationship between them, so as to use the form of value to economically regulate production, accumulation and consumption, supply and demand, etc." However, "our actual cost planning work is often lacking in economic basis. Individual ministries and general administrations often mechanically distribute cost reduction quotas and tasks among their enterprises. Little attention is paid to economically reasonable distribution of orders among enterprises, little attention is paid to improving production collaboration, material and technical supply, shortening transportation distances, etc. As a result, the enormous possibilities of greatly reducing the higher individual costs of individual enterprises and further reducing the overall level of cost of many products (departmental average cost) have not been utilized."
    Fifth, what is the relationship between product cost and product value? In addition to quantitative differences, are there qualitative differences between them?
    On this issue, M. Shakov both opposes L. Kantel's statement of opposing product cost and product value, thinking that product cost is not a category of value at all, and opposes the statement of others that product cost and product value only have quantitative differences. He pointed out: "Cost as a socialist economic category is first of all a part of product value. In the above-mentioned article by L. Kantel, the cost is studied by detaching it from the basis of cost - value, and the comrades who commented on L. Kantel's article almost all pointed out this major error. But when talking about cost is a part of product value, it is certainly not right to think that there are only quantitative differences between them. If this view is agreed, it is to fundamentally cancel the cost as an independent economic category. Therefore, we disagree with L. Kantel's opinion, not because he thinks there is a difference between value and cost, but because he separates cost from value and says that cost is not a category of value at all. Money is the form of value. The fact that cost is the monetary form of production cost already shows that cost is a category of value."
    When talking about the relationship and difference between the two economic categories of product cost and product value, he pointed out: "The direct difference between value and cost, two economic categories with independent significance, lies in the fact that they are two definitions of social production costs (reflecting socially necessary consumption). Value reflects the consumption of social labor (past labor and living labor) embodied in the product, while cost is the social consumption of used means of production and labor remuneration of production personnel expressed in currency. Of course, this does not exclude but requires that each product has both its own individual cost and its own individual value, and this individual value reflects its specific production conditions."

    苏联初步总结关于产品成本这一社会主义经济范畴的讨论
    孙耀君
    本报以前介绍的苏联经济学界关于产品成本这一社会主义经济范畴的讨论（见1956年6月12日本报第三版）已经由莫·沙科夫在苏联“经济问题”杂志上著文予以初步总结。现在我们就上次所讲的几个问题，简单介绍一下这个初步总结。
    第一，产品成本的经济本质是什么？产品成本同生产产品的社会必要消耗量的关系是怎样的？
    关于这个问题，莫·沙科夫同意第一种意见，即认为产品成本按其经济本质来讲，是由生产产品的社会必要消耗量来决定的，它的基础是产品的价值即社会必要消耗。他指出：“在产品的再生产过程中，经常要以社会基金的形式提出一部分产品来补偿已消耗的生产资料和生产工作人员的生活资料，这是每个新的生产周期周而复始的必要条件。这个客观过程就是把价值的前两部分（已消耗的生产资料的价值和为自己的产品的价值）提出来列为成本的基础。”而“价值是体现在产品中的社会劳动（过去的劳动和活劳动）消耗量的一般表现形式。”
    可是，他又认为产品成本不是完全只取决于生产产品的社会必要消耗量，并且也取决于某些不属于社会必要消耗的产品生产和流通时实际发生的耗费。关于这个问题，他在下面有较详细的阐述。
    第二、产品成本包括些什么？产品成本是否包括非生产性的耗费？
    关于这个问题，莫·沙科夫认为非生产性的耗费是包括在产品成本之中的，这样就使产品成本的作用更大了。他认为这一点同前述的产品成本的基础是价值即社会必要消耗的说法并没有矛盾。因为产品成本是价值的货币形式，所以可能背离其价值基础。他指出：“列入完全成本中的流通费用的各项要素，也像其他一些生产以外的开支（各种罚款、产品短缺和损坏等）一样，不属于产品的价值形成过程，但它们同所有的生产开支一样，是由价值来补偿的。有人要问：这是不是同上面所说的成本是价值的一部分的定义相符合呢？是的，是符合的。正如前面所指出的，成本并不单纯是价值的一部分，而是它的货币形式，这个货币额在经营管理的具体条件不同的情况下，可能脱离其价值基础。”
    他批评那些认为产品成本中不包括非生产性耗费的人说：“有些经济学家认为，既然成本是价值的一部分，那成本中就应该只包括纯生产开支。这种见解不是从实际生活出发的，而是从不正确地解释理论公式出发的。即使完全正确的理论公式也只能够反映各种现象的实质，并不能包括复杂多端的全部具体现象。生活实践比任何理论公式都丰富得多。因此，生活实践对成本的具体内容所带来的变化不能因为不合乎理论公式而抛掉”。
    第三，部门平均成本（社会成本）是否存在？应该从什么角度来考察产品成本问题？
    莫·沙科夫认为部门平均成本（社会成本）是存在的。他认为不应该只从企业的角度来看，而是要从社会的角度来考察产品成本问题，产品成本之所以采取各个企业的生产费的形式，只是由于经济核算制的缘故。他说：“成本不是私营企业的生产费，而是社会主义企业（公有财产）的生产费。因此，它是用货币额表明社会生产产品花费了多少钱，但因为社会主义企业是根据经济核算原则经营的，所以成本要采取各该企业的生产费的形式。”
    他又指出不能把产品成本看作一个国民经济部门范围内的范畴；而要当作“国民经济范畴”。他说：“显然，说成本只同某一个国民经济部门例如只同工业有关，那是完全错误的。这是同事实根本矛盾的，也是没有理论根据的。作为国民经济范畴的成本是实际存在的。除了工业产品成本之外，还有农业（集体农庄和国营农场的成本）的产品成本、机器拖拉机站的拖拉机工作成本、运输成本、建筑安装工程成本等。”
    第四，产品的成本是怎样确定的？在成本的确定中，社会主义国家起着怎样的作用？
    莫·沙科夫认为产品成本的客观基础是产品的价值即社会必要消耗，但社会主义国家可加以调节和计划，并且有时在实际成本计划中还往往有缺乏经济根据的情形。他认为“价格、成本和社会净收入（通过货币表现的）是在实践中，即社会主义计划管理中所运用的具体价值形式。社会主义国家在它们之间规定一定比例关系，借以利用价值形式从经济上调节生产、积累和消费、供应和需求等。”可是，“我们的实际成本计划工作往往是缺乏经济根据的。个别部和总管理局往往是在自己的企业之间机械地分配降低成本的限额和任务。很少注意从经济上合理地在各企业之间分配定货的问题，很少注意改进生产协作、物资技术供应、缩短运程等问题。结果，大大降低个别企业的较高的个别成本和进一步降低许多种产品成本总水平（部门平均成本）的巨大可能性没有被利用起来。”
    第五，产品成本和产品价值之间的相互关系是怎样的？它们之间除了量的差别外，有没有质的差别？
    在这个问题上，莫·沙科夫既反对勒·康特尔把产品成本和产品价值对立起来、认为产品成本根本不是价值范畴的说法，又反对另一些人认为产品成本和产品价值只有量的差别的说法。他指出：“作为社会主义经济范畴的成本首先是产品价值的一部分。在上面提到的勒·康特尔的文章中，是脱离成本的基础——价值去研究成本的，对勒·康特尔的文章发表意见的同志几乎都指出了这个重大错误。但在谈论成本是产品价值的一部分时，认为它们之间只有数量上的差别当然是不对的。如果赞成这种观点，就是要根本取消作为独立经济范畴的成本。因此，我们不同意勒·康特尔意见的，并不是由于他认为价值和成本之间有差别，而是在于他使成本脱离了价值，说成本根本不是价值范畴。货币是价值形式。成本是生产费的货币形式这一事实已经说明成本是价值范畴。”
    在讲到产品成本和产品价值这两个经济范畴之间的关系和区别时他指出：“价值和成本这两个有独立意义的经济范畴的直接区别，在于它们是社会生产费（反映社会必要消耗）的两个定义。价值反映着体现在产品中的社会劳动（过去劳动和活劳动）的消耗，而成本则是用货币表现的所使用的生产资料和生产工作人员劳动报酬的社会消耗。当然，这并不排除而是要求每个产品既有自己的个别成本又有自己的个别价值，这个个别价值反映着它的具体生产条件。”
