    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd. Shenyang City recently accepted 509 North Korean interns. They have been assigned to 31 factories to study production technologies in areas such as machinery manufacturing.
    In addition to some workers or demobilized soldiers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the majority of these North Korean interns are orphans who lost their relatives during the Korean War and were raised in our country. These orphans have been cared for in our country for the past four years, are all in good health, and have completed their secondary school studies. Therefore, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided this year to select a group of orphans over the age of 18 and send them to Shenyang and other places to study industrial production technology, with plans to return home in a year to participate in peaceful construction.
    In order to ensure that the interns can master production technology in a short period of six months or a year, 31 factories in Shenyang have established internship guidance committees to specifically organize and lead the training work. Before the interns arrived at the factories, the factories prepared clothing for the interns, arranged for food and accommodation, and purchased a large number of Korean books, newspapers, and magazines for them.

    帮助朝鲜培养技术人材
    新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳市最近接纳了五百零九名朝鲜实习生。他们已经被分派到三十一个工厂，学习机械制造等方面的生产技术。
    这批朝鲜实习生除部分是来自朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工人或复员军人外，大部分是在朝鲜自卫战争中失去亲人以后在我国养育起来的孤儿。这批孤儿在我国经过四年来的抚养，身体都很健壮，并且都结束了中学课程的学习。为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府决定，今年抽调一批十八岁以上的孤儿，分派沈阳等地学习工业生产技术，计划在一年以后回国参加和平建设。
    为了保证在半年或一年的短时期里能教会实习生掌握生产技术，沈阳三十一个工厂都成立了实习生指导委员会，专门组织领导培养训练工作。在实习生到达各厂以前，各厂都为实习生准备了衣服，安排了食宿，并且为他们购买了大批朝鲜文的书报和杂志。
