Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, August 29th: In August, in the dense forests of the Genhe Forestry Area in the Greater Khingan Range, the roar of diesel-powered saws was heard for the first time. Red sawdust flowed rapidly from the saw kerf, and in less than three or four minutes, a larch tree more than 30 meters high and more than 30 centimeters in diameter crashed to the ground. The work experience of Yang Xiyuan, who is operating the power saw, reflects the transformation of the Greater Khingan Range forest industry. Before 1952, he used heavy, cumbersome whipsaws for logging, which was laborious and inefficient. Later, he began to use light, curved-handled saws for logging, but it was still manual labor. Now, he uses diesel-powered saws for logging, and he is filled with indescribable joy.

After the power saws were put into production, people from various forest industrial bureaus in the Greater Khingan Range came to visit. When the young members of the logging shock brigade first used power saws, they all wanted to use this kind of machinery. Later, when they heard that a large number of power saws would be put into production soon, they were extremely happy. Now, they are all working hard and studying culture in the evenings, striving to become power saw operators in the future.

In recent years, the Greater Khingan Range forest industry has widely utilized machinery in production, leaving only one process—the logging process—without using machines. Now that diesel-powered saws are being used for logging, all processes in the Greater Khingan Range forest industry are using mechanized production.

    第一次用机器伐木
    新华社海拉尔29日电　8月份里，在大兴安岭根河林区的密集的森林中，第一次响起了柴油动力锯的吼叫声。红色的锯末顺着锯口迅速地流下来，不到三、四分钟，一棵高三十多公尺，直径三十多公分的落叶松树便轰隆隆地倒在平地上。正在操纵动力锯的杨喜元的工作经历，反映了大兴安岭森林工业的变革。他在1952年以前，使用着笨重的大条锯采伐，又费劲，效率又低；以后开始用轻便的弯把子锯采伐，但仍然是手工业。现在，他用柴油动力锯采伐，心里有说不尽的高兴。
    动力锯投入生产后，大兴安岭各个森林工业局都派人前来参观。青年采伐突击队的小伙子们，在刚使用动力锯的时候，都想使用这种机械，后来听说最近还有大批动力锯投入生产的时候，他们高兴极了。现在，他们都在努力做好工作，到了晚上就学文化，争取将来当个动力锯手。
    大兴安岭森林工业近几年来在生产中已经广泛利用了机械，只剩一道工序——采伐工序没使用机器。现在开始用柴油动力锯采伐，大兴安岭森林工业的各个工序都采用机械生产了。
