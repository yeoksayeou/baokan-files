Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 28th - According to Antara News Agency, two representatives of the 5,000 rebels active in southeastern Kalimantan negotiated terms of surrender with Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Major General Nasution on August 27th.

One of the rebel representatives, Dadiansjakuk, said at a press conference after meeting with Major General Nasution that he was very pleased to be able to meet with military leaders. He said, "From now on, we are willing to cooperate with the Indonesian government and people to help build our motherland." He said that rebel leader Ibnu Hadjar had authorized him to negotiate the terms of "ceasing combat under the principle of returning to society."

Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Basri, the Army Commander of Southeast Kalimantan, who accompanied the rebel representatives, said that the time for Ibnu Hadjar and his men to surrender would be determined later. He added, "I believe Ibnu Hadjar will come out of the jungle soon." Prior to this, Ibnu Hadjar had personally contacted Lieutenant Colonel Basri to negotiate surrender.

The successive surrenders of mobile armed bandits in eastern Indonesia began with rebel leaders Balo and Ali, who were the first to respond to President Sukarno's call to the rebels: "Return to society and help build the country." Balo and Ali led their 40,000 troops in South Sulawesi to express their willingness to help government forces attack the bandits of the "Islamic State Movement" led by Muchakar in the same area. They signed an agreement with the army leadership expressing their loyalty to the government.

    印度尼西亚加里曼丹东南部叛军
    同陆军当局谈判向政府投诚条件
    新华社雅加达28日电　据安塔拉通讯社消息：活动在加里曼丹东南部的五千名叛军的两名代表在8月27日同印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安少将谈判叛军投诚的条件。
    叛军代表之一达迪安斯贾库在会见了纳苏蒂安少将以后在一次记者招待会上说，他很高兴能够同军方领导会谈，他说，从今以后，我们愿意同印度尼西亚政府和人民合作，帮助建设我们的祖国。他说，叛军首领伊布努·哈贾授权他来谈判“在我们回到社会中来的原则下停止战斗”的条件。
    和这些叛军代表一起来的加里曼丹东南部陆军司令哈桑·巴斯里中校说，伊布努·哈贾和他的部下投诚的时间将在以后确定。他又说，我相信伊布努·哈贾不久就会从丛林中出来。在这以前，伊布努·哈贾曾亲自和巴斯里中校有过接触，谈判投诚。
    印度尼西亚东部的流动武装匪徒络续投诚，是由叛军首领巴洛和阿里开始的，他们最先响应苏加诺总统对叛军的号召：“回到社会中来，帮助建设国家”。巴洛和阿里率领他们在南苏拉威西的四万队伍表示愿意帮助政府军队攻击在同一地区穆查卡尔所领导的“伊斯兰国运动”的匪徒。他们同陆军领导签订了一项协定，表示效忠政府。
