    The Moroccan Youth in Struggle
    Morocco　Muḥàmòdé Sēn de Xī
    Under the past protectorate system, Moroccan youth and the people of the whole country suffered the same oppression. Whether worker, peasant, or student, they only had obligations and no rights.

    Every worker had to do heavy work, but the wages earned were not enough to support his family. There were no trade union organizations, and in order not to be dismissed, workers had to accept any labor; but if they became ill, they would always be dismissed.

    The exploitation suffered by the peasants was even more cruel than that suffered by their worker brothers; because in reality they were slaves in the hands of the local landlords, working sixteen hours a day on the colonists' farms; if they were to resist, they would starve to death or go to prison.

    As for the Moroccan youth, they had no freedom whatsoever, and were subjected only to the enslaving education of the colonists. Anything related to the Moroccan nation was either deleted or fabricated in school textbooks. From childhood, they were made to learn a foreign language—the language of the French colonists—while at the same time extremely discriminating against the Moroccan national language, history, and culture. From a young age, they were taught to praise and admire everything that was French, educating the youth to obey the colonial state and unconditionally accept the orders of the colonists. The youth had no right to organize cultural or sports groups.

    The colonialists thought their rule was solid, but the Moroccan youth did not acknowledge this fact, their hearts filled with anger. Soon, we felt the necessity to organize, because unity is strength. In factories and in schools, there were secret group organizations, united around the "Youth Action Party."

    For several years, the youth's work had two goals: on the one hand, to strengthen their own organization and unity, and on the other hand, to propagate the path to liberation to the Moroccan people. We worked towards this goal until August 20, 1953. But on this day, France forcibly forced our King Mohammed V to abdicate, while at the same time imprisoning other political leaders, or exiling them to distant lands. At this time, Moroccan youth issued an appeal to the people, calling for armed struggle. Within a week of King Mohammed V being transported to Madagascar, the flames of struggle were ignited. Whether in the cities or in the countryside, armed struggle was widely organized, and the occupation forces were everywhere in panic. National traitors supporting the occupation forces were arrested, and their forces were besieged.

    For twenty-five months, this struggle continued. The enemy's conspiracies were exposed, our offensives gained victories everywhere, and the enemy's strength weakened day by day. The heroes who sacrificed on the battlefield used their lives to express their love for their motherland and freedom. Their names hang on everyone's lips, and they will always be revered by us. In the second year of the war, our Liberation Army, mostly composed of young people, waged a decisive struggle against the enemy, and the enemy had no choice but to give in.

    The fruits of our victory continue to increase every day. After forty-five years of suffering and oppression, our happy days have finally arrived. Mohammed V victoriously returned home. That day, the French government recognized Morocco's independence and signed the Moroccan independence treaty. On the day France signed, Spain, which occupied the northern territory of Morocco, had no choice but to give up its occupation. Therefore, as a result of forty-five years of long struggle, the Moroccan youth and people victoriously seized the independence and sovereignty of their motherland from the hands of the colonialists.

    At this time, another kind of struggle began for us, because national independence is only a prerequisite for creating a better future. On the day of independence, King Mohammed V appealed to the people, calling on all people to work hard for the domestic social, economic, and cultural revival. Everyone is enthusiastically engaged in the construction of the regained free motherland, and they will better complete their tasks. Therefore, the young people reorganized their ranks and stood at the forefront of the new struggle. For example, one month after liberation, members of the "Moroccan Student Union" volunteered to participate in rural literacy work. They also participated in health and healthcare activities in rural areas. Today, students are voluntarily giving up their summer vacations in order to work hard to carry out these social undertakings.

    On the other hand, national independence has resulted in new cultural and sports organizations. Youth organizations united with each other and expanded even more. Moroccan youth are also able to actively participate in the movements and organizational meetings called by international youth.

    The newly independent Moroccan people and its youth are willing to cooperate and unite with other nations to fight against the colonialists together. This cooperation and unity will develop day by day, and it will be expressed in various forms. Our cooperation and unity with the Algerian people is a very prominent example. In addition, we Moroccan youth extend brotherly hands to the free people of the world, so that we can unite together, help each other, to benefit our construction undertakings and progress, and to benefit the freedom and peace of all the people of the world.

    在斗争中的摩洛哥青年
    摩洛哥　穆哈默德·森的西
    在过去保护国制度之下，摩洛哥青年和全国人民受着同样的压迫。不论他是工人、农民或学生，都是只有义务没有权利。
    凡是工人一定要作繁重的工作，但所获得的工资则不足以维持他的家庭生活。没有工会组织，为了不被解雇，工人得接受任何的劳动；但他如果生了病，则总是会被解雇的。
    农民们所受到的剥削比他们的工人兄弟所受到的更为惨酷；因为在实际上他们是当地土豪手中的奴隶，在殖民者农庄里他们每天要工作十六小时；假使他们要反抗的话，那就将会饿死或者去坐监狱。
    至于摩洛哥的青年们，他们没有任何自由，所受到的只是殖民者的奴化教育。凡是有关摩洛哥国家的东西，在学校教科书上一律被删去，或者加以捏造。令人从小时就开始学习一种外国语——法国殖民者的语言，一方面又极端歧视摩洛哥民族语言、历史和文化。令人从少年时代就赞扬和爱慕一切只要是法国的东西，教育青年人服从殖民国家，无条件地接受殖民者的命令。青年人并没有权利组织文化方面或体育方面的团体。
    殖民主义者以为他们的统治是巩固的，但摩洛哥青年则不承认这种事实，他们的内心里充满着愤怒。很快，我们感觉到有组织起来的必要，因为团结才是力量。在工厂里，在学校里，都有了秘密的团体组织，他们团结在“青年行动党”的周围。
    几年以来，青年们工作的目标有两方面：一方面在于加强他们自己的组织和团结，另一方面在于向摩洛哥人民宣传走向解放的道路。一直到1953年8月20日，我们就为了这个目标在工作。但到了这一天，法国用武力强迫我们的国王穆罕默德第五世退位，同时将其他的政治领袖关禁起来，或者放逐到异地。这时，摩洛哥青年们向人民发出呼吁，实行武装斗争。在国王穆罕默德第五世被运往马达加斯加岛一星期之后，斗争的火焰就燃烧起来。不论在城市或在农村，武装斗争普遍地组织起来了，占领军到处惶恐不安。支持占领军的民族叛徒被逮捕了，他们的武装被围困起来。
    在二十五个月的期间内，这种斗争一直在进行着。敌人的诡计被戳穿，我们的进攻到处获得胜利，敌人的力量一天比一天地削弱下去。在战场上牺牲了的英雄们，他们用自己的生命来表现他们为祖国和自由的爱。他们的名字挂在我们每个人的嘴唇上，他们将会永远受到我们崇敬。在第二年的战争中，我们的大部分由青年人组成的解放军对敌人进行决定性的斗争，敌人不得已才让步了。
    我们胜利的果实还不断地每天在增加。在受了四十五年的痛苦和压迫之后，我们的快乐的日子终于来到了。穆罕默德第五世胜利地回了国。那天，法国政府承认摩洛哥的独立，并在摩洛哥独立条约上签了字。当法国签字的日子，占领摩洛哥北部领土的西班牙也只好放弃它的占领权。因此，经过四十五年长期的斗争结果，摩洛哥青年和人民胜利地从殖民者的手中夺回了祖国的独立主权。
    这时，我们的另一种斗争又开始了，因为民族独立不过仅仅是为了创造更美好的未来而应具备的先决条件。在宣布独立之日，国王穆罕默德第五世向人民呼吁，号召全体人民努力于国内社会方面、经济方面和文化方面的复兴。每个人都很热心地从事于重获自由的祖国的建设事业，他们将会更好地完成自己的任务。因此，青年人们又重新组织了自己的队伍，站在新的斗争的前线。举个例子说：在解放后一个月，“摩洛哥学生联合会”的会员们自愿参加了农村扫盲运动的工作。他们在农村里也参加了卫生和保健事业的活动。今天，学生们都自愿放弃了暑假，以便努力于开展这些社会事业的工作。
    另一方面，民族独立的结果产生了新的文化和体育团体。青年组织互相团结起来，而且更加扩大了。摩洛哥青年们也能够积极参加国际青年号召的运动和组织的会议。
    重新独立了的摩洛哥人民和它的青年们愿意和其他民族合作团结，共同向殖民主义者作斗争。这种合作团结将会一天比一天地发展，它用各种形式表现出来。我们和阿尔及利亚人民的合作团结是个极显著的例子。此外，我们摩洛哥青年向世界各地的自由人民伸出兄弟的手，以便团结在一起，互相帮助，以有利于我们的建设事业和进步，有利于全世界人民的自由与和平。（本报特约稿）
