Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 23rd: Yunnan Province, which has a large variety of crops, is currently organizing local varieties to prepare for autumn planting and future promotion of improved varieties.

Yunnan Province has discovered approximately 15,000 varieties of various crops. However, in the past, not enough attention was paid to collecting local excellent varieties. In addition, many good varieties were lost due to farmers investing in agricultural cooperatives during the socialist transformation in agriculture last winter and this spring. In order to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives for excellent varieties, various localities have successively begun to collect and organize local crop varieties. Leaders of the CCP Jiangchuan, Chengjiang, and other county committees have also gone deep into the fields to advise agricultural cooperatives to reserve seeds during harvesting.

In the process of organizing varieties, many local crop varieties with special value and unique properties have been discovered. For example, the Zaobai millet in Luxi County, the Xiaohui millet in Huaning County, and the Cuibai millet in Yimen County all have the advantages of early maturity and strong cold resistance, making them suitable for double-cropping rice varieties. The Dahong millet in Lincang County can not only be planted in the plain areas at an altitude of about 1,000 meters, but also has a maximum yield of 1,000 catties per mu. The Xueshan early corn in Yangbi County has strong cold resistance and a short growing period, making it suitable for planting in general alpine regions. A type of tea called "Nuocha" found in Yuanjiang County not only has the advantages of ordinary Pu'er tea, but also has a rich color, aroma, and taste. Shuangbai County has a type of linked-kernel kapok with white fluff, fine and long fibers, and strong resistance to red bollworm pests. These varieties are now being further identified.

The Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture held a symposium on organizing local crop varieties in mid-August. In addition to inspecting and resolving the problems existing in the organization of varieties in various localities, it required agricultural technology extension stations in various localities to ensure that no variety is missed under the leadership of the CCP Party Committee.

    云南整理农作物地方品种
    新华社昆明23日电　农作物品种繁多的云南省，目前正在进行地方品种的整理工作，为秋种和今后推广良种作准备。
    云南省已经发现的各种农作物的品种约有一万五千多个。但是，以往对收集当地的优良品种重视不够，加之去冬今春全省在农业社会主义改造中，农民入社投资，也使不少良种散失。为了满足农业社对优良品种的需要，各地已经陆续展开收集和整理当地农作物品种的工作。中共江川、澂江等县委员会的负责人还深入田间，建议农业社收割时留种。
    各地在整理品种中，已经发现许多具有特殊价值和有特种性能的农作物地方品种。如泸西县的早白谷，华宁县的小灰谷和易门县的翠白谷，都具有成熟早、耐寒力强的优点，适合做双季稻的品种。临沧县的大红谷不仅可以在海拔一千公尺左右的平坝地区种植，而且每亩最高产量可以达到一千斤，漾濞县的雪山早玉米抗寒力强，生长期短，一般高寒山区都可以栽种。在元江县发现的一种名叫“糯茶”的茶叶，不仅具有一般普洱茶的优点，而且色香味浓。双柏县有一种联核木棉，绒白、纤维细长，抵抗红铃虫害的能力较强。现在，这些品种正在被进一步加以鉴定。
    云南省农业厅在8月中旬召开的整理农作物地方品种的座谈会，除检查和解决各地整理品种中所存在的问题外，要求各地农业技术推广站在中共党委领导下做到不遗漏一个品种。
