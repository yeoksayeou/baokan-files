    The Bird-Painting Hunter
    Ai Qing
    A man wanted to learn how to hunt, so he found a hunter and asked to become his apprentice. He said to the hunter, "One must have a skill. Among many professions, I have chosen hunting. I really want to go into the woods with a gun and shoot the birds I want to shoot."

    So the hunter examined the apprentice’s gun. It was a good gun, and the apprentice was also a determined one. He told him about the characteristics of various birds and some knowledge about aiming and shooting, and instructed him to find various birds to practice on.

    The man listened to the hunter and thought that as long as he knew how to hunt, he could hunt. So he took his gun into the woods. But as soon as he entered the woods, before he could raise his gun, the birds flew away.

    So he came to the hunter again and said, "The birds are clever. They saw me before I saw them. As soon as I raise my gun, the birds have already flown away."

    The hunter said, "Do you want to shoot birds that can't fly?"

    He said, "To be honest, when I want to shoot a bird, it would be great if the bird didn't fly!"

    The hunter said, "Go back, find a piece of cardboard, draw a bird on it, hang the cardboard on a tree, and shoot at that bird—you will definitely succeed."

    The man went home and did as the hunter said. He tried shooting a few times, but couldn't hit it even once. He had to go to the hunter again. He said, "I did as you said, but I still can't hit the bird in the drawing." The hunter asked him what the reason was. He said, "Maybe the bird is drawn too small, or maybe the distance is too far."

    The hunter pondered for a while and said to him, "I am very touched by your determination. Go back, hang a larger piece of paper on the tree, and shoot at the paper—this time you will definitely succeed."

    The man asked worriedly, "Is it still the same distance?"

    The hunter said, "That's up to you to decide."

    The man asked again, "Is there still a bird drawn on the paper?"

    The hunter said, "No."

    The man smiled wryly and said, "Isn't that just shooting at paper?"

    The hunter told him very seriously, "What I mean is, just shoot at the paper first. After you've finished shooting, draw birds where there are holes. Draw as many birds as there are holes—this is the most surefire way for you."

    画鸟的猎人
    艾青
    一个人想学打猎，找到一个打猎的人，拜他做老师。他向那打猎的人说：“人必须有一技之长，在许多职业里面，我所选中的是打猎，我很想持枪到树林里去，打到那我想打的鸟。”
    于是打猎的人检查了那个徒弟的枪，枪是一枝好枪，徒弟也是一个有决心的徒弟，就告诉他各种鸟的性格，和有关瞄准与射击的一些知识，并且嘱咐他必须寻找各种鸟去练习。
    那个人听了猎人的话，以为只要知道如何打猎就已经能打猎了，于是他持枪到树林。但当他一进入树林，走到那里，还没有举起枪，鸟就飞走了。
    于是他又来找猎人，他说：“鸟是机灵的，我没有看见它们，它们先看见我，等我一举起枪，鸟早已飞走了。”
    猎人说：“你是想打那不会飞的鸟么？”
    他说：“说实在的，在我想打鸟的时候，要是鸟能不飞该多好呀！”
    猎人说：“你回去，找一张硬纸，在上面画一只鸟，把硬纸挂在树上，朝那鸟打——你一定会成功。”
    那个人回家，照猎人所说的做了，试验着打了几枪，却没有一枪能打中。他只好再去找猎人。他说：“我照你说的做了，但我还是打不中画中的鸟。”猎人问他是什么原因，他说：“可能是鸟画得太小，也可能是距离太远。”
    那猎人沉思了一阵向他说：“对你的决心，我很感动，你回去，把一张大一些的纸挂在树上，朝那纸打——这一次你一定会成功。”
    那人很担忧地问：“还是那个距离么？”
    猎人说：“由你自己去决定。”
    那人又问：“那纸上还是画着鸟么？”
    猎人说：“不。”
    那人苦笑了，说：“那不是打纸么？”
    猎人很严肃地告诉他说：“我的意思是，你先朝着纸只管打，打完了，就在有孔的地方画上鸟，打了几个孔，就画几只鸟——这对你来说，是最有把握的了。”
