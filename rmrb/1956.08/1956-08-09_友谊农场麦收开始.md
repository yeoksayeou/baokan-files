Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, August 7th: The first large-scale wheat harvest at the state-owned Friendship Farm began yesterday. In the golden wheat fields, grey and red combine harvesters are moving swiftly. The cut wheat is transformed into grains and poured into the grain tank in less than twenty seconds. One after another, trucks loaded with wheat rush along the field roads to the threshing ground. The machines on the ten electrified threshing grounds are working day and night, replacing manual winnowing.

According to statistics up to the evening of August 5th, the average yield of wheat that has already been harvested and threshed by the farm is 1.332 tons per hectare.

    友谊农场麦收开始
    据新华社佳木斯7日电　国营友谊农场第一次大面积的麦收工作，已经在昨天开始。在金色的麦田里，灰色的和红色的联合收割机迅速地行动着。割下的小麦，不到二十秒钟就变成麦粒，吐进粮箱。一辆一辆满载麦子的载重汽车，沿着田间道路奔向晒麦场。十个电气化晒麦场上的机器日夜不息地代替人工扬场。
    到八月五日晚间的统计，农场已经收割、脱粒的小麦，每公顷平均产量是一点三三二吨。
