    Doubts about the "Abolish Names" Theory
    Ren Hui
    Last Saturday, I went to the Summer Palace and saw a middle school nearby called "No. 101 Middle School." A fellow traveler blurted out, "With a school in such a good location, it would be so much better to call it Summer Palace Middle School."
    This reminded me of another incident. At a gathering of scientists, I overheard the following conversation:
    "You used to be at..."
    "Tsinghua. Graduated in 1932."
    "Ah, then we're old classmates. I'm also from Tsinghua, five years after you."
    "There are quite a few of us from Tsinghua at this conference." The words "us from Tsinghua" were full of emotion.
    Thus, they talked about the campus, the school spirit, the student atmosphere at the time, and the quirks of the old professors... Both were immersed in joyful memories.
    Allowing schools to have fixed names, allowing them to preserve a unique school spirit and tradition, and allowing these names to become a spiritual connection between alumni of different generations, I don't think this would be harmful to the cause of socialist construction, would it? But in recent years, the trend of "abolishing names and assigning numbers" has become prevalent.
    Not only is this the case in the education sector, but other sectors have also not been spared. Aren't the names of Commercial Press and Kaiming Bookstore, which had a fairly deep impression on intellectuals, already gone? Even many old shops and stores familiar to the common people have been changed to No. 7 Sales Department and No. 8 Supply Station?
    This trend has also spread to the literary and art circles, which should be "rich and diverse." Our literary magazines and artistic groups seem to have a set of rules for renaming, either "People's" or "China's," such as "People's Literature," "People's Music," "China Peking Opera Theater," and so on. The most thorough and ironic example is the cartoon magazine. In foreign countries, some magazines of this kind are called "Crocodile," some are called "Arrow," and some are called "The Gooseherd Boy, Marji," but in China, it is simply called "Cartoon." It's like a person's business card only having one word printed on it: "Person."
    The theoretical basis for this "abolish names" theory is said to be, first, for neatness and "uniformity"; second, because the names of the old era all have feudal characteristics. Then, shouldn't provincial names like Hebei and Anhui, and county names like Wanping and Changzhi, also be abolished and assigned numbers? I imagine that in a few years, people's resumes will be in the following format:
    Name: Wang Seventeen
    Hometown: Province No. 5, County No. 38, Township No. 226.
    Education: Graduate of Middle School No. 98, Province No. 11.
    Occupation: Manager of No. 7 Sales Department of No. 3 Non-Staple Food Store, City No. 9, Province No. 15.

### “废名论”存疑

    “废名论”存疑
    任晦
    星期六到颐和园去，在附近看到一所中学，校名是“第一○一中学”。一位同游者脱口而出：“学校办在这样一个好地方，叫颐和中学多好。”
    这使我想起了另一件事情。在一个科学家的集会上，我听到过以下的对话：
    “您以前在……”
    “清华。1932年毕业的。”
    “啊，那是老学友了。我也是清华，比你晚五年。”
    “这次会上，咱们清华的人可不少啊。”“咱们清华”这四个字充满了感情。
    这样，他们就谈到校园，谈到校风，谈到当时的学生风气，谈到老教授们的癖好，……两个人都沉浸在欢乐的回忆中了。
    让学校有一个固定的名称，让他保存一种具有独特风格的校风和传统，让这个名字成为先后校友的精神上的联系，我想，这对社会主义建设事业不会有什么害处吧。可是这几年来，“废名排号”却已经成了风气。
    不仅教育界如此，其他各界也未能免俗。在知识分子心中有相当深厚印象的商务印书馆、开明书店这些名称，不是早已不见了么？甚至许许多多老百姓熟悉的老铺老店，不是也纷纷改为第七门市部、第八供应站了么？
    这种风气也流行到了应该是“丰富多采”的文艺界。我们的文艺杂志、文艺团体似乎有了一套正名规律，不是“人民”，就是“中国”，如“人民文学”、“人民音乐”、“中国评剧院”等等。最彻底、也最有讽刺性的是漫画杂志。在外国，这一类杂志有的叫“鳄鱼”，有的叫“箭”，有的叫“牧鹅少年马季”，而我们中国，就直接了当地叫做“漫画”。正像一个人的名片上只印着一个字：“人”。
    这种废名论的理论根据，据说第一是为了整齐，为了“统一”；第二是因为旧时代的名称都有封建性。那么，像河北、安徽这一类省名，宛平、长治这一类县名，也都应该废名排号了吧。我设想若干年后，人们的履历表将如下式：
    姓名：王十七
    籍贯：第五省、第三十八县、第二二六乡。
    学历：第十一省第九十八中学毕业。
    职业：第十五省第九市第三副食品商店第七门市部经理。
