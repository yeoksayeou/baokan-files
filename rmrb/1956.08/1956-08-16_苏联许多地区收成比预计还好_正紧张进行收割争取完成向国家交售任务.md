Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, August 15th – In these days, millions of collective farm peasants, state farm and machine tractor station workers in the Soviet Union are engaged in intensive harvesting and fulfilling the state grain purchase plan. Many urban workers and intellectuals have volunteered to go to the countryside to help with the harvest. The area being harvested is expanding day by day. In the first five days of August, collective farms throughout the Soviet Union harvested only 7,339,000 hectares of grain. In the second five days, they had already harvested 8,293,000 hectares. State farms harvested more than 1.5 million hectares of grain from August 5th to 10th. By the 10th, approximately 39 million hectares of grain (excluding corn) had been harvested throughout the Soviet Union. More than three-quarters of the grain harvested on collective farms and nine-tenths of the grain harvested on state farms has already been threshed.

The harvest in the south is nearing completion. Moldova, three southern regions of Ukraine, the Kuban, Stavropol, Azerbaijan and many districts of the Don region in the Caucasus have all completed harvesting.

Kazakhstan has harvested four million hectares of grain. There is a bumper harvest everywhere in the republic, and the bumper harvest in the new lands is even more moving. Many state farms in the new lands are threshing more than 100 poods of grain per hectare.

Siberia is also having a bumper harvest. In many areas, more grain is being threshed than expected. Collective farms and state farms in Altai have calculated that they can sell 350 million poods of grain to the state, instead of the 300 million poods previously mentioned. The Novosibirsk region originally estimated that it could give the state 90 million poods of grain, but due to the bumper harvest and the adoption of segmented harvesting methods to reduce losses, it will sell 106 million poods of grain to the state.

Silage harvesting is underway in many regions throughout the Soviet Union. The Russian Federation has prepared more than 1.5 million tons of corn silage, approximately four times as much as at this time last year.

    苏联许多地区收成比预计还好
    正紧张进行收割争取完成向国家交售任务
    本报莫斯科15日电　苏联千百万集体农庄农民、国营农场和机器拖拉机站工人这些日来进行着紧张的收割和完成着国家采购粮食的计划。许多城市工人和知识分子自愿到农村来帮助收割。收割的面一天天扩大。八月头五天中全苏联集体农庄还只收割了七百三十三万九千公顷谷物，第二个五天中已经收割了八百二十九万三千公顷。国营农场从八月五日到十日，收割了一百五十多万公顷的粮食。截在十日前，全苏联收割了谷物（不包括玉米）约三千九百万公顷。在集体农庄里收下的粮食的四分之三以上、国营农场里收下的粮食的十分之九，已经打好。
    南部的收割将近结束。摩尔达维亚，乌克兰南部三个州，高加索的库班、斯塔甫罗波尔、阿塞拜疆和顿河的许多区，都收割完毕。
    哈萨克斯坦已经收割四百万公顷粮食。共和国各地都丰收，新地的丰收更动人。新地上的许多国营农场每公顷打一百普特以上谷物。
    西伯利亚也丰收。在许多地区打下的谷物比期望的多得多。阿尔泰集体农庄和国营农场计算出了，它们能够交售给国家的，不是以前所说的三亿普特谷物而是三亿五千万普特。新西伯利亚州原先估计能给国家九千万普特谷物，但由于丰收和采用减少损失的分段收割法，将交售国家一亿零六百万普特谷物。
    全苏联许多地区进行着青贮饲料的收割。俄罗斯联邦准备了一百五十多万吨玉米青饲料，约为去年此时的四倍。
