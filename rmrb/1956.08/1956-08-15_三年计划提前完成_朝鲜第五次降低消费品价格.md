Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 13th: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will lower state-regulated consumer goods prices starting August 14th. This is the fifth price reduction since the armistice.

According to a decision passed by the Korean Cabinet on August 11th, the average percentages by which the prices of major consumer goods sold by state-owned businesses and cooperative businesses will be reduced are as follows: cotton textiles 10%, some silk textiles 15%, rubber shoes and sneakers 23%, enamelware 23%, medicines 29.1%, tobacco 10.7%, sugar 36%, and in addition, the prices of seven other commodities such as socks, soda, and cosmetics will also be reduced by 14% to 50%.

The realization of this price reduction is a result of many departments in Korea completing the Three-Year Plan (1954-56) ahead of schedule, increasing labor productivity, and reducing product costs.
