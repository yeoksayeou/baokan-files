    Shouting Alone Isn't Enough
    Er Li

    "Rats running across the street, everyone yells 'kill them!'" We have often used this idiom in recent years to describe the scene of bad things being exposed, isolated, and eliminated. Recently, the cry to "overcome bureaucracy" has been deafening. Bureaucracy, intimidated by the momentum, is indeed not as arrogant as before. But after all, it is not as timid as a mouse, so it still sits firmly like a mountain. It seems that just "shouting" is not enough; we need to really "strike." But how to strike? There is still no answer. Some people are gradually losing confidence: "Go deep? It can't be as comfortable as sitting on a sofa! I think it's just talk!" In fact, this accusation is indeed a bit unfair to most bureaucrats. Having been nurtured by the Party for more than a decade or even decades, and being in this booming construction upsurge, if truly considering walking two or three *li* a hardship, one would feel guilty. Besides, there are cars, bicycles, tricycles... So, where is the problem exactly? Let's listen to the "insiders" confess.

    It was a rare cool summer night, and people who had worked for a day were enjoying the selfless gift of nature to their hearts' content. Several people with considerable responsibility, who had just left the meeting room, were no exception. They chose a well-ventilated place and sat down. Section Chief ×, who had recently heard quite a bit of "public opinion" about him from below, felt a bellyful of grievances surging up again: "Who doesn't want to go deep? But these endless documents, even if just skimming through them, would take four or five days a week, plus a few days of meetings, and all plans would be ruined." Minister × was almost furious with the recent meetings: "After discussing for a month, isn't the final conclusion still 'basically completed the task, greatly improved a step, but there are still serious shortcomings and errors, mainly... secondly... thirdly... In order to carry out comprehensively, widely, deeply and persistently, we must: First, strengthen political and ideological leadership... Second... Eighth'?" After reciting to this point in one breath, he couldn't help but laugh along with everyone. Bureau Chief ×, who had been troubled by this formulaic article these days, couldn't help but sigh and say: "This kind of stereotyped writing has become a disaster. Recently, we wanted to collect information on the implementation of the × resolution. We spent a lot of effort, urging the reports like chasing after lives, and got eight reports. Alas, they are simply from the same mother, all long-winded and empty." Office Director × had a slight objection to this comment: "You also have to understand the suffering of those below. Take me, for example. To be honest, it is very doubtful whether 360 days a year are spent serving the people. I think I am serving plans, summaries, and reports. Think about it! Monthly summaries, monthly plans, quarterly summaries, quarterly plans, half-year summaries, half-year plans, annual summaries, annual plans, plus special reports, ten-day reports, monthly reports, and those instructions that connect the top and the bottom, getting deeper and deeper, spending all year in a hurry grabbing materials, writing materials, studying and deliberating materials... As for whether the materials are reliable, only heaven knows. Now, even these unreliable materials have become treasures, and there is a shortage of materials everywhere. For example, one case is often moved around, it's on the Party's documents, and it's still on the documents of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. Who should be responsible for this bureaucracy and Party jargon? I think it's a muddleheaded account."

    The night grew deeper, and people began to disperse. These several people with considerable responsibility had fully vented their grievances. The conclusion was: "We are forced by objective circumstances, what can we do?" So, they felt at ease and relieved, and fell into a sound sleep.

    Although people have already fallen asleep, a large string of questions remain—how to get rid of these endless meetings? How to jump out of the pile of documents? Which meetings should be held? Which meetings should not be held? Which way of holding them is good? Which way is bad? Which documents are needed? Which are not needed? How is Party jargon formed? How to overcome Party jargon?… How should these questions be solved, and who should solve them?

    The "plight" of these several people with considerable responsibility tells us this truth: to overcome bureaucracy, it must be accompanied by a series of reforms and transformations: to revolutionize the "meeting mania," to revolutionize Party jargon, to reform the system; to reform the institutions… Without this, no matter how you swear, curse, or scold, the so-called opposition to bureaucracy is just talk. Therefore, I suggest that all those who sincerely want to break with bureaucracy should first launch a brainstorming movement!

    光喊是不行的
    而立
    “老鼠过街，人人喊打”。我们这几年常用这句成语来形容坏的东西被揭露、被孤立、被消灭的情景。近来，“克服官僚主义”的喊声震耳欲聋，官僚主义慑于声势，确实已不像以前那么神气了，但它毕竟不是胆小如鼠者，所以仍然安坐如山，看起来，光“喊”是不够的，得真“打”才行。如何打法呢？至今尚无答案。有人渐渐有些信心不足了：“深入？哪能像坐在沙发上那样舒服！我看是说说而已！”其实，这一责难对大多数官僚主义者说来，确实有些冤枉。在党的培育下十几年甚至几十年了，又处在这热火朝天的建设高潮中，如果真正把走个三、二里路引为苦事，也太问心有愧了；况且还有汽车、脚踏车、三轮车……。那么，问题究竟在哪里？我们还是听一下“内行”人的自诉吧。
    是一个稀有的凉爽的夏夜，劳动了一天的人们，都在尽情地享受着大自然的这一无私的赏赐。刚离开会议室的几个负有相当责任的人也不例外，选了个通风的地点，坐了下来。×科长近来听到下边对他颇有点“舆论”，一肚子的冤气，现在又冲了上来：“谁不想深入呢？可是这些看不尽的文件，就是走马观花，一周也得用四、五天，再开上几天会，一切计划都完蛋了。”×部长对这几天的会议简直有些愤怒了：“讨论了一个月了，最终还不是‘基本上完成了任务，大大地提高了一步，但还存在严重的缺点和错误，主要是……其次……再次……。为了全面地，广泛地、深入持久地开展，必须：第一、加强政治思想领导……第二……第八’”一口气背到这里，自己也禁不住跟着大伙笑起来。×局长这些天正为这一公式化的文章苦恼着，因此不胜慨叹地说：“这种八股文章已经泛滥成灾了，近来我们想搜集一下贯彻×决议的情况，费了好大力气，追命似的催来了八份报告，唉，简直是一个娘养的，全都是长篇大论，空洞无物。”×办公室主任对这一评论都有点异议：“你们也得体谅体谅下边的苦楚，像我吧，老实说，一年三百六十天是不是为人民服务很值得怀疑。我看是在为计划、总结、报告服务。想想吧！月总结、月计划、季总结、季计划、半年总结、半年计划、年总结、年计划，再加上专题报告、旬报、月报以及那些承上启下的指示，越陷越深，终年在匆匆忙忙的抓材料、写材料，研究推敲材料……至于材料可靠与否，只有天知道。现在，连这些不可靠的材料也成为珍品了，到处在闹材料慌，一个例子，经常搬来搬去，党的文件上是它，工会和青年团的文件上还是它，这些文牍主义、党八股到底该谁负责？我看是本糊涂账”。
    夜渐深了，人们开始散去，这几位负有相当责任的人，满腹牢骚业已尽情发泄无余，结论是：“客观情况所迫，我们有什么办法呢？”于是，心安理得，如释重负地酣然睡去。
    人虽然已经安然入梦，可是问题却剩下了一大串——怎样摆脱这些开不完的会？怎样跳出公文堆？哪些会应该开？哪些会不应该开？哪样开法好？哪样开法不好？哪些文件需要？哪些不需要？怎样形成的党八股？怎样去克服党八股？……。这些问题究竟应该怎样解决，谁来解决？
    这几位负有相当责任的人的“苦衷”，告诉了我们这样一条真理：要克服官僚主义，必须伴随着一系列的改革和转变：要革“会议迷”的命，革党八股的命，要改革制度；要改革机构……。不如此，任你怎样发誓、诅咒、叫骂，所谓反对官僚主义也不过说说而已。因此建议所有真心愿与官僚主义绝交的人们，先来开展一个开动脑筋的运动！
