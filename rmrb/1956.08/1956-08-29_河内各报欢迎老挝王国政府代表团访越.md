Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 28th: Hanoi newspapers today published editorials and commentaries welcoming the Royal Lao Government delegation's visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The "People's Daily" editorial said: The Royal Lao Government delegation's visit to Vietnam is of great significance. It marks a new development in restoring and developing the long-standing friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries, and it also records a new victory for the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

	The editorial pointed out that Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have all been subjected to colonialist aggression and rule. The colonialists once adopted their consistent policy of division in an attempt to undermine the friendly relations between Vietnam and Laos, and international reactionaries are still carrying out this vicious conspiracy. However, the people of the two countries have continuously fought side by side against colonialism and liberated their own nations. At present, the people of the two countries share a common desire, which is to consolidate peace, achieve national reunification, complete national independence, and make their motherlands increasingly prosperous. The editorial said that although the political systems of the two countries are different, this does not hinder effective cooperation between the two countries.

	The editorial also stated that the Royal Lao Government delegation's visit will contribute to enhancing trust and understanding between the peoples of the two countries.

	"Daily Hanoi News" and the Hanoi Chinese "New Vietnam-China News" both published commentaries pointing out that the Royal Lao Government delegation's visit to Vietnam provides a favorable opportunity to begin restoring friendly relations between the two countries and to fulfill the deep desire to achieve peaceful coexistence between the two nations.

    社论指出，越南、老挝和柬埔寨都曾经遭到殖民者的侵略和统治。殖民者曾经采取它们一贯的分裂政策企图破坏越老两国的友好关系，现在国际反动分子也还在执行这个恶毒阴谋。但是，两国人民曾经不断地并肩进行斗争，反对殖民主义，解放自己的民族。目前两国人民正有着一个共同的愿望，这就是巩固和平、实现国家的统一、完成民族独立、使自己的祖国日益繁荣。社论说，两国之间的政治制度虽然不同，但是这并不妨碍两国的有效合作。
    社论还说，老挝王国政府代表团的这一次访问将对增强两国人民之间的信任和了解作出贡献。
    “每日河内报”和河内中文“新越华报”都发表评论指出，老挝王国政府代表团这次访问越南是为开始恢复两国之间的友好关系和实现两个民族的和平共处主张的深切愿望供提了一个有利的机会。
