    Shenyang Smelter Technical Personnel
    Through Free Discussion and Collective Research, Solved Major Technical Problems
    (By Our Newspaper) A major technical problem of processing copper flue dust that the Shenyang Smelter had not solved for eight years was resolved after free discussions and collective research by engineers and technicians throughout the plant. According to preliminary calculations, copper and lead worth more than 800,000 yuan can be extracted from the accumulated 1,200 tons of flue dust alone.
    This discussion began after assistant engineer Zhang Zhidao and technicians Li Fengding and Yuan Jun proposed a plan. Before proposing this plan, they had conducted more than 40 experiments.
    During the discussion, all the plant's engineers and technicians gathered in the chief engineer's office. Chief Engineer Li Guang presided over the discussion. Assistant Engineer Zhang Zhidao explained the plan they proposed. These plans were divided into three types: "rotary kiln separation method," the original "lead sintering machine treatment method," and the newly researched "reverberatory furnace smelting method." Zhang Zhidao believed that the "reverberatory furnace smelting method" was better than the previous two treatment methods. It can recover ten elements such as lead and copper, creating more wealth for the country.
    At the meeting, Assistant Engineer Li Zuyou questioned the "reverberatory furnace smelting method": "Is it possible to recover sodium compounds from the molten liquid? I have never seen this done before." Assistant Engineer Cao Dayi opposed the "reverberatory furnace smelting method," believing that this method was uneconomical and troublesome to manage, and advocated using the current "lead sintering machine treatment method," arguing that no new reverberatory furnace needed to be added. However, Assistant Engineer Zhang Kaizhu disagreed with his opinion, advocating a completely different new method: "Dismantle the old reverberatory furnace and rebuild it completely."
    After further discussions, the opinions of "lead sintering machine treatment method" and "demolishing the old reverberatory furnace for complete reconstruction" were quickly negated by others' arguments. Everyone believed that: trees are planted by people, and roads are opened by people. To build socialism, we must do countless things that our predecessors have not done. If we bind ourselves with the idea of "never seen before," it is conservative thinking. If we want to carry out large-scale construction and completely transform the reverberatory furnace, we have to stop production and rebuild, which requires a lot of investment and cannot complete the production plan. After everyone analyzed in this way, the people who originally raised different opinions also agreed.
    Later, the focus was concentrated on the "reverberatory furnace smelting method" (hereinafter referred to as the new method) and the "lead sintering method" (hereinafter referred to as the old method), and the debate became unprecedentedly fierce. Chief Engineer Li Guang believed that the old method had many shortcomings, not only recovering less copper and lead for the country, but also affecting the improvement of lead quality. Technicians Li Fengding and Yuan Jun supplemented his speech. They said: Due to the use of the old method, the quality of crude lead in late July was low, and it failed to complete the national plan by 0.04%. Although the new method costs some money, the value it creates for the country is many times greater. His opinion was agreed by everyone.
    In the discussion, everyone made supplements to the new method, expanding the internal area of ​​the reverberatory furnace in the new method from 3.84 square meters to ten square meters. In this way, it can process more than 13 tons of copper flue dust for the country per day than the original reverberatory furnace, and the quality of the lead system can also be improved. The old problem was initially solved. An engineer said with a smile after the meeting: "In the past, we were all small-scale farmers, not in contact with each other and acting on our own." An engineer next to him grabbed the conversation and said: "That is the old almanac, and we can't look at it! With the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, wisdom is concentrated, and it is easy to solve even the oldest problems!"

    沈阳冶炼厂技术人员
    自由讨论，集体研究，解决了重大的技术问题
    本报讯　沈阳冶炼厂八年来没解决的处理铜烟灰的重大技术问题，经全厂工程师和技术人员自由讨论和集体研究后，得到了解决。据初步计算，仅从积存的一千二百吨烟灰中，就可提取价值八十余万元的铜和铅。
    这次讨论是在助理工程师张志道和技术员李逢鼎、袁俊提出方案后开始的。在提这个方案前，他们曾进行了四十多次试验。
    讨论的时候，全厂工程师、技术员都聚集在总工程师办公室里。总工程师李光主持讨论。张志道助理工程师就他们提出的方案做了说明。这些方案分“回转窑分离法”、原有的“铅烧结机处理法”和新研究出的“反射炉熔析法”等三种。张志道认为“反射炉熔析法”比前两种处理方法好。它能收回铅、铜等十种元素，给国家创造的财富多。
    会上，助理工程师李祖祐对“反射炉熔析法”提出疑问：“熔液回收钠的化合物是否可能？过去没见过这种作法。”助理工程师曹大义反对“反射炉熔析法”，认为这种方法不经济，管理麻烦，主张用现在的“铅烧结机处理法”，理由是不用新添反射炉。但是，助理工程师张开翥又不同意他这种意见，主张完全用另外一种新方法：“把旧反射炉全拆了新建”。
    经过进一步开展讨论之后，“铅烧结机处理法”和“拆除旧反射炉全部改建”的意见很快被别人的论据所否定。大家认为：树是人栽，路是人开，要建设社会主义，就要办无数的前人没办过的事，如果以“没见过”束缚住手脚，是保守思想；如果要大兴土木全部改造反射炉，就得停止生产改建，既需大量投资，又不能完成生产计划。大家这样分析后，原来提出不同意见的人，也很赞成。
    后来焦点集中到“反射炉熔析法”（下称新法）和“铅烧结法”（下称旧法）上，大家辩论空前热烈。总工程师李光认为：旧法的缺点多，不但给国家收回的铜和铅少，还影响提高铅的质量。技术员李逢鼎、袁俊对他发言做了补充。他们说：由于使用旧法，七月下旬的粗铅质量低，差0.04％没完成国家计划。采用新法虽然要花些钱，但给国家创造的价值却大好多倍。他的意见得到了大家的同意。
    大家讨论中对新法做了补充，把新法中的反射炉内面积，由3.84平方公尺，扩大到十平方公尺。这样比原来反射炉一天可多给国家处理十三吨多铜烟灰，铅系统质量还可以提高。老问题初步解决了，一位工程师在会后眉开眼笑地说：“从前咱们都是小农经济，互不联系，自做主张。”他旁边一位工程师抢过话来：“那是旧皇历看不得！有了百家争鸣方针后，智慧集中，解决再老的问题也容易！”
