What are they busy with? What results have they achieved?
Ma Chaojun

In late May of this year, the Communist Party Committee of Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, held an expanded meeting of county and township cadres. The central topic of the meeting was to summarize the spring production work and arrange the summer work tasks. Logically speaking, to convene such an important meeting, the county party committee should have made good preparations beforehand. But, in reality, the county party committee only superficially touched upon the situation and assigned the task of drafting the report to two staff members. Since the county party committee had not thoroughly discussed and studied what should be summarized from the spring and what should be arranged for the summer work, how could the two staff members draft a good report? They had no choice but to reproduce the spring work plan, add some details of completion, and include some scattered examples, resulting in a comprehensive, balanced, and lengthy report of over ten thousand words that did not solve any problems. After the report was completed, it was simply read at the county party committee meeting and “smoothly” passed. Later, the provincial work team, finding this unacceptable, suggested making revisions. This suggestion made the county committee members uneasy. County Party Secretary Li Zhiyuan asked Deputy Secretary Zhao Xiaowu to revise it. Secretary Zhao repeatedly emphasized that "his cultural level was not high enough to write it," and pushed it to County Magistrate Yuan Buli. Although Magistrate Yuan said that he "did not grasp the intentions of the prefectural committee and was unprepared," but with the report due to be presented to the meeting the next day, could he still decline? Helplessly, he had to shoulder this heavy burden, working through the night to finally revise it. Presumably, when revising, Magistrate Yuan only considered the length. As a result, the revised draft was not as "good" as the original. Not only was it still general, but the biggest problem was that it omitted many important work items. Soil and water conservation and forestry construction are very important tasks in a mountainous county like Hunyuan, but the report did not mention them at all. The county's livestock mortality rate was very serious, but the report only said: "Livestock mortality is very serious, specific solutions will be studied and resolved by everyone." It is no wonder that people, after hearing such a report, said: "This expanded cadre meeting was really an insignificant, time-wasting meeting."

Such unthinking behavior is not just a single instance in the leadership of Hunyuan County Party Committee, but a long-standing problem. For many major tasks, the county committee largely did not conduct serious research and discussion, or put forward their own plans and opinions. And the summaries, reports to the higher authorities, and instructions and plans issued to the lower levels were rarely written by them personally. Some county committee members did not even read the reports sent from below.

Not only did the county committee not use their brains much, but they also did not move their legs frequently. Although they identified six key cooperatives and assigned responsibilities, most county committee members had not even visited the key cooperatives from the transition to advanced cooperatives until June. Deputy Secretary Yao Chengde, who was responsible for liaising with the Qiaomaichuan Agricultural Cooperative, admitted that he had never been there even once. Although Deputy Secretary Zhao Xiaowu made a trip to Qiaomaichuan, it was only when a cadre from the Rural Work Department of the Yanbei Prefectural Committee went down that he accompanied them. Secretary Li Zhiyuan visited his assigned Jiubei Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative once, and that was when he was sending Deputy Director Cui Huamin of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to work in the village. He only stayed there for half an hour, without gaining a good understanding of the situation or solving any problems, and then left. County committee members visited key cooperatives so rarely, so it was even rarer to see them in general cooperatives.

Does this mean that the county committee is just lazy and unwilling to work? Of course not. Superficially, they are still "busy" beyond belief! However, they are busy with meetings and some administrative work. According to Deputy Secretary Yao Chengde, the county committee holds almost two or three meetings every day, and sometimes four or five. Sometimes one meeting is not finished before they are being urged to attend the next one. In addition, the county committee also takes over the work of various government departments, with this department coming to discuss work and that department coming to convey instructions from higher authorities. They even manage things like cadres going to the countryside with grain coupons. As a result, let alone taking more time to consider the county's major tasks, going deep into the countryside to understand the situation, and creating experience, the county committee is struggling to keep up with attending meetings and handling daily affairs.

Since the county committee members devote most of their energy and time to attending meetings and dealing with administrative work, they can only play the role of transmission agents in leading the county's work. Whatever work is assigned by the higher authorities, they simply copy it and do it, rarely putting forward their own opinions or formulating practical and feasible implementation plans based on the local conditions. Some tasks assigned from above, the county committee clearly knows cannot be completed, but they do not make any modifications and simply push them down. For example, this year, the higher authorities assigned the county the task of digging 1,600 wells for water and drought resistance. The local conditions made it impossible to complete, but although the county committee mentioned it to the Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, the higher authorities still insisted on completion, and the county committee simply "implemented" it. As a result, some villages, in order to complete the task, dug wells in low-lying, damp areas that should have been drained; some villages that could easily draw river water for irrigation dug wells by the river. In the end, the task was still not completed. The provincial work team found their approach very strange and asked the county committee why they insisted on completing the task even when it was impossible. They said: "This is the task assigned by the higher authorities, we cannot not complete it."

From the above facts, the problems in the leadership style of Hunyuan County Party Committee are serious enough. But according to our understanding, this is not the most serious case in the Yanbei area. What is the reason for this? After preliminary investigation, it turns out that the leadership of the Communist Party Committee of Yanbei Prefecture also has the problem of not working deeply and specifically enough. Thus, this trend spreads like a contagious disease level by level, from the prefectural committee to the county committee, and from the county committee to the county and township cadres. As a result, everyone takes it for granted, and sometimes even uses the excuse of "these are all the same problems" to comfort themselves and not seek improvement. Therefore, to completely change this general leadership style, we must start from the top. If we do not improve from the root, there will not be much improvement at the bottom, and even if there is improvement, the old problems will relapse.

    忙什么？忙出了什么结果
    马超骏
    今年五月下旬，中共山西省浑源县委召开了一次县、乡干部扩大会议。会议的中心议题是总结春季生产工作和布置夏季工作任务。按理说，召开这样一个重要的会议，县委应该在会前作一番很好的准备工作。其实不然，县委只是轻描淡写地扯了扯情况，就把起草报告的任务交给了两个干事。既然县委没有很好的讨论、研究出春季该总结些什么，夏季工作该布置些什么，两个干事又有什么办法起草好报告呢？只好把春季工作计划作了翻版，加进了一些完成情况，又套了一些零乱的例子，就写出了一个面面俱到、四平八稳、长达万余字但却不解决什么问题的大报告。报告写齐后，县委会上只念了念，就“顺利”地通过了。后来，省里下乡工作组看着这太不像话，提议让修改修改。这个意见可使县委们作了难，县委书记李志远让副书记赵孝武同志修改，赵书记再三强调“文化程度不高写不了”，推给袁步礼县长修改；袁县长虽然说是“不摸地委意图，也没有准备”，但是，第二天就要向大会作报告了，尽管推辞还行吗？无奈，只好担起这个千斤重担，开了个夜车，总算修改出来了。大概在修改的时候，袁县长只考虑了短的缘故吧？结果修改稿反不如原稿“好”了，仍然是一般化不用说，最大的问题是丢了许多重要的工作项目。水土保持、林业建设在浑源县这样的山区是很重要的工作，可是报告中一句也没有提到。全县牲口死亡现象十分严重，但报告中只说：“牲口死亡很严重，具体办法，大家下去研究解决。”这就难怪人们听了这样的报告说：“这次扩干会真是个不痛不痒，浪费时间的会议”了。
    像这样不动脑筋的事情，在浑源县委领导上来说并不是只此一桩，而是长期存在着的问题。许多重大工作，县委大部都没有进行过认真研究、讨论，提出自己的方案和意见。而向上级写的总结、报告，向下发的指示、计划等文件，也都很少亲自去写，有的县委委员甚至连下边写来的报告也不阅读。
    县委不仅脑筋动得不多，连腿也跑得不勤。他们虽然确定有六个重点社，并且也分了工，但从转高级社到六月份，大部县委委员没去重点社打过照面。副书记姚成德同志负责联系的荞麦川农业社，他就承认一次也没去过。另一个副书记赵孝武同志虽到荞麦川跑了一趟，那是在雁北地委农村工作部一个干部下去时，他才相跟去的。书记李志远同志曾到他所联系的旧裴庄农业社走了一次，也是在送省农林厅副厅长崔化民到该村工作时去的，到那里只停了半小时，情况既没有很好了解，问题更没有解决什么，就走了。县委委员到重点社都去得这样少，一般社就更见不到县委委员的面了。
    这是不是县委就懒的不愿做工作呢？当然不是。要从表面上看，他们还是“忙”得不可开交呢！不过都忙在开会和一些事务工作上罢了。据县委副书记姚成德同志谈，县委每天几乎要开两、三个会，多时一天要开四、五个会，有时这个会还没开完，第二个会议又去催了。再加上县委又把政府各部门的工作也包揽过来，这个部门来研究研究工作，那个部门来传达传达上级指示，甚至连干部下乡带粮票的事情，县委也管起来了。这样一来，县委不用说拿更多的时间去考虑全县重大工作，深入下乡了解情况，创造经验，就连参加开会和处理日常事务都应接不暇了。
    既然县委委员把绝大部分精力和时间应付了开会和事务工作，因此，对全县工作领导，就只能起个承上转下的作用。上边布置个什么工作，他们就照猫画虎去搞个什么工作，从来很少根据当地具体情况，提出过自己的意见，制定出切实可行的实施方案。有些上面布置的工作，县委明明知道完不成，但也不加任何修改，就硬往下搬。如今年上级分配给该县打水、旱井一千六百眼的任务，本来当地没有条件完成，县委虽向专署农林局提了一下，但上级仍让完成，县委也就照样“贯彻”下去了。这样一来，有的村为了完成任务，就把水井打在应该排水的下湿地里；有的村本来不用费大劲就可以引河水浇地，却在河边上又打了水井。结果，任务还是没有完成。省里工作组看到他们这种做法很奇怪，问县委为什么完不成也要硬完成，他们说：“这是上级布置的任务，不能不完成。”
    从上述事实来看，浑源县委领导作风上存在的问题是够严重的了。但据了解，这在雁北地区来说还不是最严重的。这又是什么原因呢？经过初步了解，原来中共雁北地委领导上也存在着工作不深入、不具体的毛病。于是，这个风气就像传染病似的一级一级的传下去，地委传染给县委，县委传染给县、乡干部，这样一来，大家也就不以为意了，甚至有时还拿“都是这样的问题”为理由来安慰自己，不求改进。因此，要彻底改变这种一般化的领导作风，必须从上面做起。如果不从根子里改进，下边就不会有多大改进，甚至在改进了以后也会旧病复发。
