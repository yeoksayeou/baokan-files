    Huaibei Low-lying Areas
    Early Rice Yield Increase and Guaranteed Harvest

    (Xinhua News Agency) According to Xinhua News Agency, approximately 100,000 mu of early rice in the low-lying areas of the Huaibei Plain, Anhui Province, has been basically harvested, with an average yield of mostly around 300 jin per mu. The Fuguang No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County, which had never grown rice before, has already harvested over 90 mu of early rice this year, with an average yield of over 318 jin per mu, some of the best reaching 900 jin per mu. The Taoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Su County, near the old course of the Yellow River, saw an average yield of 350 jin per mu for 35 mu of double-cropping early rice.

    Changing to rice cultivation is an important measure for the low-lying areas of the Huaibei Plain to avoid disasters, ensure harvests, and increase yields. These low-lying areas have traditionally grown dryland crops, with very low yields and no guarantee of harvest. Although there were concentrated rainstorms this summer, most of the early rice had already been harvested before the rains and was not affected.

    淮北低洼地区
    早稻增产保收
    据新华社讯　安徽省淮北平原低洼地区约十万亩早稻已经基本收完，每亩平均产量大多在三百斤左右。以往从未种过水稻的阜阳县阜光第一农业社，今年已收的九十多亩早稻，每亩平均产量达318斤多，其中有些好的每亩达九百斤。靠近黄河故道的宿县桃山农业社，三十五亩双季稻早稻每亩平均产量达三百五十斤。
    改种水稻，是淮北平原低洼地区避灾保收、提高产量的重要措施。这些低洼地区历来种植旱粮，产量很低，而且不能保收。今年夏季虽然暴雨集中，但是大部分早稻在雨前已经收割，未受影响。
