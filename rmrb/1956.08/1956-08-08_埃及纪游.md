    Travels in Egypt

    (II) Under the Pyramids
    About ten miles west of Cairo, three pyramids stand like giants on the edge of the desert. We visited the largest, called the Pyramid of Khufu. At noon, the sun was scorching, and looking up at the pyramid, its apex seemed to be approaching the dazzling sun. Facing this pyramid, constructed of 2.3 million blocks, each weighing two and a half tons, one can only marvel at the genius of the Egyptian people. Around 3000 BC, an Egyptian tyrant named Khufu conscripted 300,000 farmers and slaves to build his "paradise" - the pyramid - over thirty years in order to "ascend to heaven" after death. When completed, the pyramid was about 147 meters high. After nearly four thousand years of wind and sun erosion, the height of the tower is now only 137 meters. But this has not diminished the pyramid's majesty in the slightest.
    Visitors in front of the pyramid are endless. Of course, some tourists come admiring the ancient Egyptian civilization; but many come for novelty. Facing the pyramid, although they appear so small, they still despise Egyptian culture.
    Beside the pyramid, there are many male guides wearing Arab robes and white headscarves. Some lead camels and horses, inviting you to ride them and gallop on the desolate sand in front of the pyramid; others are professional tower climbers. On the fifty-one-degree steep slope of the pyramid, climbers ascend along more than 250 steps to the top of the tower in just four and a half minutes, and descend in just two and a half minutes.
    From the north side of the pyramid, we climbed into a huge triangular limestone arch entrance, ingeniously designed. After walking a short passage, there appeared an uphill path with a low ceiling and a slope of about forty-five degrees, so we had to crawl up. After dozens of meters of slope, we passed through a low cave to a stone room of less than ten square meters. There was nothing here, only an empty stone coffin. Next to the stone coffin was a pit about three meters deep, nailed with wooden planks, said to be the place where the emperor stored jewelry. Leaving the cave entrance of the stone room, down the slope, turning halfway, through another passage about twenty-five meters long with a very low ceiling, we arrived at another stone room, which was the queen's tomb. The room was empty and there was nothing in it. There was only a deep hole, which was also said to be a place for storing jewelry.
    The high heat and turbid air inside the pyramid made people gasp. It was not until we walked out of the triangular arch that we breathed a sigh of relief.
    The glory of the pyramid belongs to the Egyptian people. Now the pyramid is still there, but the tyrant's body is gone. According to the records of the Greek historian Herodotus, it was once widely rumored that a peasant uprising had occurred in ancient Egypt, and the tyrant's body had been torn to pieces by the angry masses.
    Beside the pyramid, a huge Sphinx is bathed in sunlight. It was carved from a whole stone by the Egyptians five thousand years ago. It and the pyramid have become monuments to ancient Egyptian civilization. (Attached picture)

    埃及纪游

    （二）金字塔下
    从开罗西行约十哩，沙漠边缘上像巨人般地矗立着三座金字塔。我们访问了最大的一座名叫库夫的金字塔。中午，烈日当空，抬头望金字塔，塔尖似乎已接近那耀眼的日头。面对着这由二百三十万块、每块重两吨半的巨石筑成的金字塔，人们只有惊叹埃及人民的天才。纪元前三千年左右，埃及一个名叫歧奥普斯的暴君为了死后“升天”，征发三十万农民和奴隶，历时三十年建成他的“天堂”——金字塔。在建成时塔高约147公尺，经过近四千年的风蚀和日曝，塔的高度现在只有137公尺了。但这并没有丝毫减逊金字塔的雄伟。
    在金字塔前游客不绝。游客中当然有仰慕古埃及文明而来的；但也有许多是为猎奇而来的。面对着金字塔，虽然他们是显得如此渺小，然而他们仍然轻视埃及人的文化。
    金字塔旁，有很多穿着阿拉伯长衫，裹着白头巾的男向导。他们有的牵着骆驼和马匹，请你坐着它们驰驱在金字塔前的荒沙上；有的是职业的爬塔者。在金字塔的五十一度陡的斜面上，爬塔者沿二百五十多级阶梯而上，直到塔顶，只需四分半钟，下塔只需二分半钟。
    从金字塔的北面，我们爬进了一个设计得非常巧妙的巨大三角形的石灰石的拱门入口。走了不长的一段甬道之后，出现了顶板很低的斜度约四十五度的上坡道，因此不能不匍匐而上。经过数十公尺的坡道以后，通过一个低矮的洞穴，到了一间不到十平方公尺的石屋。这里什么也没有，只放着一个空石棺。石柩旁有一个约三公尺深的地坑，用木板钉着，据说是皇帝存放珠宝的地方。出石屋洞口，下坡道，中途转弯，经另一条约二十五公尺长的顶板很低的甬道，到了另一个石屋，这是皇后的陵室。室内空空如也，一无所有。只有一个深洞，据说也是存放珠宝的地方。
    金字塔内高热和混浊的空气使人气喘，直至走出那三角形拱门，才舒畅地松了一口气。
    金字塔的光荣属于埃及人民。如今金字塔犹在，而暴君的尸体已经不见了。根据希腊历史家希罗多德的记载，曾经盛传，在古埃及发生过农民起义，这个暴君的尸体已经被愤怒的群众撕得粉碎。
    金字塔旁，一座巨大的狮身人面像沐浴在阳光中。这是五千年前埃及人用一块完整的石头雕琢成的。它和金字塔同样成为埃及古代文明的纪念碑。（附图片）
