Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th: According to British newspapers, the Prime Minister of Malta, Mintoff, and the British authorities have had friction on the island of Malta, an important British naval base. The direct cause of the conflict was the measures taken by Britain to establish a so-called "air bridge" in the area near the Suez Canal, especially because the British authorities warned Maltese fishermen via radio to evacuate certain islands to facilitate the landing of flying boats evacuating the families of British military personnel from Egypt.

Mintoff protested that the British authorities took these measures without notifying him, and ordered the cutting of the wires of the British-run radio station and the felling of the telephone poles.

Mintoff also accused the British authorities of other measures against Malta. He said that Britain had promised to give Malta 5 million pounds of "aid" annually, but in reality "not half a penny was given."

    马耳他岛总理
    同英当局发生磨擦
    新华社16日讯　伦敦消息：据英国报纸报道，马耳他岛总理明托福和英国当局在马耳他岛这个英国重要海军基地上发生磨擦。冲突的直接原因是，英国为了在靠近苏彝士运河的地区建立所谓“空中桥梁”而采取了一些措施，尤其是因为英国当局通过电台警告马耳他岛渔民，要他们从某些岛屿撤退，以便于从埃及撤退英国军职人员家属的飞艇登陆。
    明托福抗议英国当局没有通知他就采取这种措施，并且下令把英国经营的无线电台的电线切断，把电线杆子放倒。
    明托福还指责英国当局对马耳他岛的其他一些措施。他说，英国曾经答应每年给马耳他岛五百万英镑的“援助”，但是实际上“半个便士也没有给”。
