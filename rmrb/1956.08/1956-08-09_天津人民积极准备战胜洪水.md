Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 8th: The floodwaters released from the upper reaches of rivers in North China are approaching Tianjin. The Tianjin Flood Control Headquarters is organizing the city's people to prepare to overcome the floods.

Recently, due to the impact of typhoons in North China, the upper reaches of the Yongding, Daqing, Ziya, and Nanyun rivers have experienced widespread heavy rain, causing simultaneous surges. The rainfall and flood flow have exceeded those of 1954. The first flood peak of the Yongding River reached Tianjin on the 6th. The water level at the Qujiadian Sluice Gate on the North Canal in the northern suburbs has reached 7.60 meters, exceeding the highest water level of 1954 by 50 centimeters.

Since the 6th, farmers in the northern suburbs and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin have been fighting the floodwaters from the Yongding River flowing into the North Canal day and night, averting many dangerous situations and preventing major breaches.

As of today, the water levels at the Beiyang Bridge and Xihe Bridge in Tianjin have also exceeded the warning levels. It is expected that the flood peaks of the Daqing, Ziya, and Nanyun rivers will also reach Tianjin by the 10th. In light of this situation, the Tianjin Flood Control Headquarters established flood control headquarters on the dikes of the Ziya River and Duliujian River this afternoon. The district heads and Party committee leaders of the respective districts are leading civilian workers to the dikes to defend against the floods. Various districts, factories, and enterprises in the city are actively preparing to inspect flood control materials, organize flood control teams, raise and reinforce some river embankments, and block sewers leading to the rivers.

    天津人民积极准备战胜洪水
    新华社天津8日电　华北各河流下泄的洪水已经迫近天津。天津市防汛指挥部正组织全市人民准备战胜洪水。
    近来华北地区因受台风影响，永定、大清、子牙、南运等河上游地区普降暴雨，同时暴涨，雨量和洪水流量都超过了1954年。第一股永定河的洪峰六日到达天津，北郊区北运河屈家店节制闸的水位已高达七公尺六十公分，超过1954年的最高水位五十公分。
    北郊区的农民和人民解放军驻津部队从六日以来，就连夜和永定河下注北运河的洪水搏斗，挽救了多处险情，未发生大的决口。
    到今天止，天津市内的北洋桥、西河桥的水位也先后超过警戒水位。预计到十日，大清、子牙、南运河的洪峰也将到达天津。根据这种情况，天津市防汛指挥部今天下午分别在子牙河、独流碱河的河堤上成立了防汛指挥所，由所在区的区长和党委的负责人带领民工上堤防守。市内各区和工厂、企业，正在积极准备检点防汛物资，组织防汛队伍，加高和加固部分河堤，堵塞通往各河的下水道。
