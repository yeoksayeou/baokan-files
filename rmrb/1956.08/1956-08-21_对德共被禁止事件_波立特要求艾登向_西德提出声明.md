Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, TASS, London, August 20th: The Chairman of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, wrote to Prime Minister Eden, requesting that he issue a statement to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the banning of the German Communist Party.

Pollitt wrote: "This action has caused serious unease in Britain. Many British citizens remember that the Hitler regime also took such actions at the beginning of its rule, followed by measures to suppress all democratic expression in Germany.

Such actions will only hinder the development of democracy in West Germany, damage the possibility of Germany's reunification, and endanger world peace."

Today's editorial in "The Daily Worker" expressed strong protest against the banning of the German Communist Party. The newspaper pointed out that the action of dissolving the Communist Party is a dangerous step in strengthening the most reactionary groups in West Germany.

    对德共被禁止事件
    波立特要求艾登向西德提出声明
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社伦敦二十日讯：英国共产党主席波立特写信给艾登首相，要求他就德国共产党被禁止一事向德意志联邦共和国政府提出声明。
    波立特写道：“这一行动在英国引起了严重的不安，许多英国公民还记得，希特勒政权当政之初恰恰也是采取了这样的行动，而随后采取了在德国压制一切民主言论的措施。
    这样的行动只会妨碍西德民主的发展，损害德国恢复统一的可能，危及世界和平。”
    “工人日报”今天的社论表示坚决抗议禁止德国共产党。报纸指出，解散共产党的行动是加强西德最反动集团的一个危险步骤。
