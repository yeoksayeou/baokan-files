On the Issue of Ethnic Identification of Minority Nationalities
Fei Xiaotong Lin Yaohua

Before liberation, due to the Kuomintang's Great Han chauvinism policy of national oppression and discrimination, the existence of minority nationalities was deliberately obscured, considering them merely branches of the Han nationality or "people with different lifestyles." However, this subjective reactionary attempt could not change the facts, but only deepened ethnic hatred and estrangement.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in China gained national equality, permanently abolished the system of national oppression, and created a close-knit and united national family. Many of the previously oppressed minority nationalities dared to openly declare their ethnic identity and put forward their ethnic names as proud members of the national family. This is a victory for our national policy. Only in countries that implement national equality will minority nationalities have this demand to restore their original appearance. Therefore, with the implementation of national policies, many ethnic names that were rarely heard of in the past gradually emerged. During the 1954 general election, it was said that hundreds of ethnic names were reported. Does the submission of these hundreds of names indicate that we have hundreds of minority nationalities in China? This is a question that should be considered.

Self-reported ethnic names cannot necessarily be used as the basis for ethnic identification because an individual's awareness of belonging to a community does not necessarily correspond to reality. This situation still exists in modern nations. Many of China's minority nationalities are in the pre-capitalist era, so this is even more likely to be the case. Some different tribes have developed into a tribe under certain historical conditions, but for a certain period, the tribes still retain their original names; some tribes have split into several tribes under certain conditions, but there may be no changes in their names. Moreover, in the pre-capitalist era, people also had regional concepts, native place concepts, and clan concepts, which may have obscured their awareness of belonging to a common community. Therefore, we cannot simply use ethnic names as the basis for ethnic identification.

People's communities are objectively existing things, products formed over a long history, and they change in the historical process. Which people's communities exist in a certain region and at a certain time is a matter that must be specifically analyzed according to the characteristics of the people's communities. This is the research on the issue of ethnic identification.

On this issue, we have discovered the following situations since liberation:

1.  Several originally different communities, tribes, or clans have formed or are forming a minority nationality, but they still retain their original names. This raises the question of whether they are one nationality or several nationalities.

2.  Originally one minority nationality, they dispersed and migrated to different regions, isolated for a long time, with no contact, and no economic ties, but basically still retain a common language, customs, and historical legends. They were referred to by other nationalities with different names (but some self-designations are still basically the same), so they reported different ethnic names.

3.  Some nationalities have been scattered throughout history. In the process of migration, some have also combined with Han people, deeply influenced, changed their language, and ethnic characteristics are no longer significant. Economically, they are inseparable from the Han people, but they are discriminated against. Their residences are still separated from the Han people to varying degrees, so-called "large dispersion and small gatherings," and they are psychologically estranged from the Han people, considering themselves a minority nationality different from the Han people.

4.  Some nationalities once held a dominant position in history, scattered throughout China, but later lost this position, were discriminated against, changed their language and other ethnic characteristics, and concealed their ethnic identity, but still maintained their ethnic consciousness.

5.  Groups of different ethnic components entered the same or adjacent areas and were referred to by other ethnic groups with the same name, so they also considered themselves to be one nationality, but their languages and customs are different.

6.  One nationality and another nationality have similar languages and close historical relations. However, due to changes in historical conditions, they later developed their own characteristics, so that within the nationality itself, opinions are divided on whether to become a separate nationality or part of another nationality.

7.  Some minority nationalities were unwilling to show their differences from the Han people during the era of national oppression, and some members of the upper class were used by the reactionary ruling class of the Han nationality to rule over other local minority nationalities. In the eyes of these minority nationalities who were ruled by them, they were with the Han people. After liberation, they demanded to publicly declare their ethnic identity as a minority nationality, but the relevant other nationalities were unwilling to recognize them as a minority nationality.

8.  Han people who migrated to minority nationality areas, there were several batches before and after, and the times were also different. The Han people who went earlier had been isolated from the Han people in the interior for a long time, and some were even influenced by the minority nationalities. They have certain differences from the Han people who went later in terms of language and customs, so they considered themselves different from the Han people and demanded to become a minority nationality after liberation.

9.  Some Han people have migrated to minority nationality areas, retained the characteristics of the Han nationality, but are not clear whether they are Han people; they use the name that nearby minority nationalities call them as their own ethnic name and are regarded as a minority nationality.

The above-listed situations can be summarized into two types of questions:

1.  Are they a separate ethnic unit, or several different ethnic units, or part of other nationalities?

2.  Are they part of the Han nationality?

We have conducted some research on these issues based on different specific situations. Some have reached preliminary conclusions and provided them to relevant ethnic groups and the government for reference, and some have undergone repeated investigations without reaching conclusions. We cannot list them all here.

When conducting research on the issue of ethnic identification for the above situations, we must pay attention to the fact that the social nature of our country's minority nationalities (especially those units with ethnic identification problems) was mostly in a pre-capitalist form or still in the budding stage of capitalism before the socialist transformation. They have not yet developed into modern nations. Therefore, we cannot simply use the characteristics of modern nations as the marks of ethnic identification. But what are the characteristics of pre-capitalist people's communities, clans, tribes, etc.? The Soviet Union is also beginning to study this issue. Our exploration in this area is still tentative, and we can only put forward some experiences here.

In our research work, some views that we now consider incorrect have occurred:

1.  Attempting to use only some special customs as the basis for ethnic identification. Different people's communities can have different customs, but in the same people's community, even modern nations, there can be different customs, so this basis is unreliable.

2.  Attempting to use only language as the only sign to distinguish people's communities. A common language is an important feature of modern nations, but it does not mean that different people's communities must have different languages. In fact, some different modern nations have the same language. Therefore, it is unfounded to classify people who speak the same language into one community.

3.  Attempting to solve the issue of ethnic identification with ethnic origin, believing that if it can be proved that a group was historically part of a certain ethnic group, the ethnic component of this group can be determined. This view ignores the changes of people's communities in the historical process. In fact, many modern nations are divided from the same tribe.

These incorrect views are all due to not grasping the characteristics of people's communities such as tribes and clans. What are the characteristics of tribes and clans? We believe that their characteristics are the embryonic state of the characteristics of modern nations. Stalin said: "The elements of a nation (referring to modern nations - author) - language, territory, common culture, etc. - did not fall from the sky, but were gradually created in the period before capitalism. But these elements were then in an embryonic state, at most a potential force that could be formed into a nation under certain favorable conditions in the future. This potential force only became a reality when capitalism rose and possessed a national market, economic center, and cultural center." (Stalin: "National Question and Leninism") This means that due to the development of people's social and economic life, the development of their language, territory, psychological quality, etc. has been promoted, and the nature of their community has changed. Therefore, the characteristics of tribes, clans, etc. are the embryonic state of the characteristics of modern nations, that is, the certain degree of commonality that exists in language, territory, economic ties, and psychological quality. It is impossible to correctly conduct research on the ethnic identification of people's communities in the pre-capitalist era without considering these commonalities.

It must be pointed out that the development degree of these four national characteristics in the embryonic stage is not balanced at different stages. Because our research on this issue is not in-depth enough, we do not yet have sufficient basis to point out how their development laws are, but we also have the following experiences and opinions on this issue.

1.  In our research, we have seen that a certain degree of common language has been established in the tribe. But this does not mean that people of the same tribe can understand everyone's words; the differences in dialects in the tribe can be very significant. For example, the differences in Miao dialects are very large. These differences may indicate that people who originally spoke the same language have developed their local characteristics due to a lack of frequent contact and long-term isolation, or that tribes that originally spoke different languages have formed a tribe, resulting in a common language, but still retaining certain differences.

Here, another noteworthy situation should be put forward, that is, different languages exist among the Jingpo people in Yunnan: Jingpo language and Zaiwa language. Both of these languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman language family, but the former belongs to the Jingpo language branch, and the latter belongs to the Burmese language branch. It is said that the Jingpo people in Myanmar also speak other languages. These language differences have exceeded the differences in dialects. So a question arises, is the current Jingpo people a community? Some people have put forward a negative opinion, because if it is said that people's communities must have a common language, how can they be said to be a community? But if we combine the research on the social nature of these people to examine this issue, we feel that such a conclusion is premature. We already know that the Jingpo people still retain a considerable degree of primitive social form. The people's community they have now formed may not have reached the stage of the tribe, that is to say, it still has a certain nature of tribal alliances. We are not very clear whether tribal alliances must have a common language, so we should not measure this kind of people's community with the characteristics of the tribe. We must further examine from other aspects whether they already exist a certain commonality, and what is the basis of this commonality. Of course, the language of the Jingpo people should also be further analyzed: what is the degree of difference between Jingpo language and Zaiwa language? Can it be considered a dialect distinction? Are they forming a tribal common language between them? Such research can enrich our knowledge of the development laws of people's communities.

2.  Common territory refers to the stable residence of the basic masses of a community in this territory in history. Generally speaking, the territory where people's communities stably reside existed before the formation of modern nations, although there are no developed economic ties, no fixed and recognized national economic centers and cultural centers among the residents in this territory. But due to the lack of economic and cultural centers, whether the people's communities in the pre-capitalist era must have contiguous residential areas has become a question worth considering. Among the minority nationalities in our country, some have experienced migration and exile due to different historical reasons, forming non-contiguous parts in the territory, but still maintain certain social ties and significant common psychology, so it cannot be considered that the dispersion in the territory is the split of the people's community. The Hui and Miao nationalities are such examples. For example, the Gelao people in Guizhou are scattered in a wide area and have lived with other nationalities for a considerable period of time, but they still have close ties within them, even extending to compatriots hundreds of miles away. We cannot deny that the Gelao people are a community because they lack long-term stable residential areas.

3.  The formation of modern nations is due to the emergence of a common economy, but it does not mean that people's communities in the pre-capitalist era have no economic ties, but only that the economic ties in this period are not as close as those of modern nations. How far the economic ties within the tribe can develop is still a question worth studying. The feudal society of the Han nationality, especially in the later period, did not have the characteristics of decentralization and fragmentation like the feudal society in Europe. This has already aroused controversy among historians about when the Han nationality formed as a national community.

At the same time, we can also pay attention to the economic ties between different ethnic components in an area in the pre-capitalist era and the impact of this connection on the stability of the community. There is such a situation in the areas adjacent to the Han residential areas, that is, the Han people live in the towns in the minority nationality areas, control the collection and distribution of goods in this area, and occupy most of the land in this area; thus, people of different ethnic components in this area are linked in a common economic structure. Although this situation has existed for a considerable period of time, people of different ethnic components still maintain their own characteristics in language and psychology and have not formed a community. This is a question worth studying.

4.  The characteristic of common psychological quality is not as easy to grasp as other characteristics. Our understanding of this characteristic is not enough, so that some people think that special customs are cultural characteristics that express a common psychological state. We feel that since common psychological quality can be called "national character," it must be a common style that runs through all aspects of people's lives and culture. Although we still have difficulty in clearly stating what the style of a certain nationality is, we cannot help but feel that there are different styles between them in contact with people of different nationalities. For example, we would not mistake Uyghur dance for Miao dance, or feel that there is no difference between Tibetan music and Korean music. If these styles are the common psychological quality of the community, this characteristic is very significant in the community in the pre-capitalist era. Therefore, when studying the ethnic identification of people's communities in the pre-capitalist era, we should pay full attention to this characteristic, not only to understand the unique style of a community in culture and life, but also to examine how this style is formed, how it changes, and what is the relationship and difference with other communities in this regard.

Our work on the study of ethnic identification is not in-depth enough, but we have touched on the issue of the characteristics of people's communities in the pre-capitalist era and the budding stage of capitalism. We realize that it is impossible to find a simple sign outside of language, territory, economic ties, and psychological quality to solve the issue of ethnic identification, and at the same time, we should not use the standards of modern nations to require people's communities in the pre-capitalist era and the budding stage of capitalism. We can only conduct specific analysis on specific issues, that is, on specific people, according to the stage of social and economic development they have reached, from the development of language, territory, economic ties, and psychological quality, to see the community they have formed and the historical changes of this community. According to our initial understanding, in the development process of people's communities, the development of each characteristic is unbalanced, and due to complex historical conditions, sometimes the germination of several characteristics is suppressed and does not get the opportunity to develop, so any one or several characteristics that show significant commonality are worthy of our attention.

It should be pointed out that the research on the issue of ethnic identification that we are conducting is not to replace the people of all ethnic groups to decide whether or not to be recognized as a minority nationality or whether or not to become a separate nationality. Ethnic names cannot be imposed on people or changed by others. Our work is only to study it from the formation of the community, provide materials and analysis, so as to help the units that have already put forward ethnic names, through consultation, to consider whether to be considered a minority nationality or whether to become a separate nationality. The answers to these questions are to be done by the people of all ethnic groups themselves, which is their right. At the same time, it must be admitted that research on the issue of ethnic identification is helpful for the people of all ethnic groups to make such decisions, because the various ethnic groups have not yet completely separated from the state of isolation and estrangement left over from the past reactionary rule, they have not had the opportunity to fully know their history, and have not had the opportunity to fully interact with other units. Therefore, they still lack sufficient conditions to make decisions on their own ethnic identification issues. The people of all ethnic groups need and welcome ethnologists to serve them on this issue.

    关于少数民族族别问题的研究
    费孝通　林耀华
    解放前由于国民党大汉族主义实行民族压迫和歧视的政策，故意抹煞少数民族的存在，认为他们只是汉族的支系或是一些“具有不同生活习惯的人”。但这种主观上的反动企图改变不了事实，只加深了民族的仇视和隔阂。
    解放后，国内各民族人民在中国共产党领导下获得了民族平等，永远废除了民族压迫制度，出现了一个亲密团结的民族大家庭。过去被压迫的少数民族有许多这时才敢公开他们的民族成分，提出自己的族名，作为民族大家庭里光荣的一员。这是我们民族政策的胜利。只有在实行了民族平等的国家里，少数民族才会有这种恢复本来面貌的要求。因此随着民族政策的贯彻，逐渐涌现出了很多过去一般人很少听到过的族名。1954年普选中，自报的民族名称据称有几百个。这几百个名称的提出是不是表示我们中国有几百个少数民族呢？这是应当提出来考虑的问题。
    自报的族名并不一定能作为族别的根据，因为个人意识到所属的共同体并不一定和实际相符合。这种情形在近代民族中还是存在的。我国少数民族许多都是处在前资本主义时期，当然更可能是这样。有些不同的部落在一定历史条件下发展成为一个部族，而在一定时间里各部落还保持着原有的名称；有些部族在一定条件下分裂成若干部族，但是在名称上可能还没有变化。而且在前资本主义时期，人们还有地域观念，乡土观念和宗族观念，这些观念又可能掩盖了他们共同体的意识。因此我们不能简单地只以民族名称作为族别的根据。
    人们共同体是客观存在的事物，是长期历史所形成的产物，而且他们是在历史过程中变化的。在一定地域上，一定时期里，存在着那些人们共同体，是一个必须就具体情况，按人们共同体的特征进行具体分析的问题。这就是族别问题的研究。
    在这个问题上，解放以来我们已经发现了下列各种情况：
    1、若干原来是不同的共同体，部落或部族，已经形成了或正在形成一个少数民族，但是还各自保留了原来的名称。因而发生了他们是一个民族还是几个民族的问题。
    2、原是一个少数民族，分散迁移到各不同地区，长期隔离，互不往来，经济上没有联系，但基本上仍保留着共同的语言，习俗，历史传说。他们被其他民族用了不同的名称相称（但是有些自称仍基本相同），因而报了不同的民族名称。
    3、历史上有些民族曾经被打散。在迁移过程中，有些又和汉人发生结合，受到很深的影响，改变了语言，民族特点已不显著，经济上和汉人已分不开，但是受到歧视，居住上和汉人还有不同程度的分离，所谓“大散小聚”，心理上和汉人有隔阂，自认为是和汉人不同的少数民族。
    4、有些民族在历史上曾经占统治地位，分散居住在中国各地，后来丧失了这个地位，受到歧视，改变了语言等民族特点，隐瞒了民族成分，但是依旧保持了民族意识。
    5、有些不同民族成分的集团进入了同一的或相邻的地区，被别族用同一名称相称，也就认为是一个民族，但语言，习俗却有区别。
    6、一个民族和另一个民族语言接近，历史上关系密切。但由于历史条件的改变，后来发展了自己的特点，以致本民族内部对于自己是单独成为一个民族还是另一民族的一部分，意见不一致。
    7、有些少数民族在民族压迫时代曾经不愿表明和汉人有区别，又有一部分上层分子受汉族反动统治阶级的利用，统治过当地其他少数民族，在这些被他们统治过的少数民族看来，他们是和汉人一起的。解放后，他们要求公开民族身份，作为一个少数民族，但是有关的其他民族不愿意承认他们是少数民族。
    8、迁居到少数民族地区去的汉人，前后有若干批，时代也不同。早去的汉人曾经长期和内地的汉人隔绝，有的甚至受了少数民族的影响，和后去的汉人，在语言、风俗习惯上有一定的区别，因而他们自认和汉人有区别，解放后要求成为少数民族。
    9、有些汉人迁居到了少数民族地区，保留汉族的特点，但是不明确自己是不是汉人；以附近少数民族称他们的名称作为自己的民族名称，而被视为少数民族。
    上面所列举的情况归纳起来可以分为两类的问题：
    1、他们是不是一个单独的民族单位，还是若干不同的民族单位，还是其他民族的一部分？
    2、他们是不是汉族的一部分？
    我们曾经根据不同的具体情况，对这些问题进行过一些研究，有些已经得出初步结论，提供有关民族和政府作参考，也有些经过反复调查，还没有得出结论的。我们在这里不能一一列举了。
    对于上述各种情况进行族别问题的研究时，我们必须注意到这一个事实，就是我国少数民族（特别是发生族别问题的那些单位）的社会性质在进行社会主义改造以前有许多还是前资本主义形态，或是还在资本主义萌芽时期的形态，他们还没有发展成为近代民族。我们因此不能简单地用近代民族的特征来作为族别的标志。但是前资本主义时期的人们共同体，氏族、部落、部族等，具有什么特征呢？对于这个问题在苏联也正在开始研究。我们在这方面的探讨还是一种尝试性质，在这里只能提出一些体会。
    在我们的研究工作中曾经发生过一些我们现在认为不正确的看法：
    1、企图仅以一些特殊的风俗习惯作为族别的根据。不同的人们共同体是可以有不同的风俗习惯的，但是在同一的人们共同体中，即使是近代民族，也可以有不同风俗习惯的存在，所以这种根据是靠不住的。
    2、企图仅以语言作为区别人们共同体的唯一的标志。共同语言是近代民族的重要特征，但是并不是说不同的人们共同体必须有不同的语言。事实上有些不同的近代民族在语言上是相同的。因此把说同一种语言的人都归在一个共同体中是没有根据的。
    3、企图以族源来解决族别问题，认为如果能证明一个集团在历史上曾经是某族的一部分，就可以确定这个集团的民族成分了。这种看法忽视了人们共同体在历史过程中的变化，事实上有不少近代民族是从同一个部族中分出来的。
    这些不正确的看法都是由于没有掌握部落、部族等人们共同体的特征。部落、部族的特征是什么呢？我们认为它们的特征就是近代民族特征的萌芽状态。斯大林说过：“民族（指近代民族——作者）的要素——语言、地域、共同的文化等等——都不是从天上掉下来的，而是还在资本主义以前的时期逐渐地创造出来的。但这些要素当时是处在萌芽状态中，至多也不过是将来在某些有利条件下可以形成为民族的一种潜在力。这种潜在力只有在资本主义上升并具备有民族市场、经济中心和文化中心的时期才变成了现实。”（斯大林：“民族问题与列宁主义”）这是说，由于人们社会经济生活的发展，促进了他们的语言、地域、心理素质等等的发展，使他们共同体的性质起了变化。因此，部落、部族等特征就是近代民族特征的萌芽状态，也就是语言、地域、经济联系、心理素质上所存在一定程度的共同性。离开了这些共同性去考察是不可能正确地进行前资本主义时期的人们共同体的族别问题研究的。
    必须指出，这四个民族特征的萌芽在不同阶段上发展程度不是平衡的，由于我们对于这个问题研究得还不够深入，现在还没有充分根据来指出他们发展的规律是怎样，但是我们对这个问题也有如下一些体会和意见。
    1．在我们的研究中，我们见到一定程度的共同语言在部族中已经具备。但是这并不是指同一部族的人都听得懂大家的话；在部族中方言的分歧可以很显著。比如苗族方言的差别就很大。这些差别可能是表示原来同说一种语言的人由于缺乏经常的接触，长期隔离，各自发展了他们地方性的特点，或是表示原来说不同语言的部落形成了一个部族，发生了共同语言，但还保存一定的区别。
    在这里应当提出另一种值得注意的情况，就是在云南景颇人中却存在着不同的语言：景颇语和载佤语。这两种话都属于藏缅语族，但前者属景颇语支，而后者属缅语支。据说在缅甸的景颇人还有说其他话的。这些语言上的差别已经超过了方言的差别。于是发生了一个问题，现在的景颇人是不是一个共同体呢？有人提出否定的意见，因为如果说人们共同体必须有共同语言，他们怎能说是一个共同体呢？但是如果我们结合了对这些人的社会性质的研究来考察这个问题，我们感觉到这样的结论是过早了。我们已经知道景颇人现在还保留着相当程度的原始社会的形态。他们现在所形成的人们共同体可能还没有达到部族的阶段，就是说还具有一定的部落联盟的性质。我们对于部落联盟是否必须已具备共同语言这一点还不十分清楚，所以我们不应当把部族的特征来衡量这种人们共同体。必须进一步从其他方面去考察他们是否已存在了一定的共同性，和这种共同性的基础是什么。当然，关于景颇人的语言也应当进一步加以分析：景颇语和载佤语的差别程度究竟怎样？是否能认为是方言的区别？他们之间是否正在形成部族共同语？这样的研究才能丰富我们对于人们共同体发展规律的知识。
    2．共同地域是指历史上一个共同体的基本群众在这一地域上的稳定居留。一般说来，人们共同体稳定居留的地域是在近代民族形成之前就存在的，虽则在这一地域内的居民中间还没有发达的经济联系，没有固定的和公认的民族经济中心和文化中心。但是由于缺乏经济和文化的中心，前资本主义时期的人们共同体是否必须具有相联接的聚居区也成了值得考虑的问题。在我国少数民族中有些曾因不同的历史原因，发生过迁徙和流亡，在地域上形成了不相联接的部分，但是依旧保持着一定的社会联系和显著的共同心理，因此不能认为地域上的分散即是人们共同体的分裂。回族、苗族就是这样的例子。又如贵州的仡佬，分散在广阔地区，和其他民族杂居已经有相当长的时期，但是他们内部却至今有着密切联系，甚至远及百来里之外的同族。我们不能因为仡佬缺乏长期稳定的聚居区而否认他们是一个共同体。
    3．近代民族的形成由于共同经济的出现，但是并不是说在前资本主义时期的人们共同体没有经济联系，只是说这时期的经济联系没有近代民族那样密切。部族内部经济联系能发展到什么程度还是一个值得研究的问题。汉族的封建社会，特别是在后期，并不像欧洲封建社会具有那样的分散和割据的特点。这已经引起历史学家对于汉族作为一个民族共同体是什么时候形成的问题的争论。
    同时我们还可以注意，前资本主义时期在一个地区内不同民族成分的经济联系和这种联系对共同体的稳定性的影响。在和汉族聚居区邻近的地区就有这一种情况，就是汉人住在少数民族地区的市镇上，掌握了这地区商品的集散，并占有了这地区大部分土地；这样把这地区不同民族成分的人联系在一个共同的经济结构中。这种情况虽则已有相当长的时期，但是不同民族成分的人在语言、心理上依旧保持着他们自己的特点，并没有形成一个共同体。这是值得研究的问题。
    4．共同心理素质这个特征并不像其他特征那样容易捉摸。我们对于这个特征的体会也是不够的，以致有人认为特殊的风俗习惯就是表现共同心理状态的文化特点。我们觉得共同心理素质既然可以称作“民族性格”，那就必须是贯穿在人们生活、文化各方面的一种共同的风格。虽则我们要明确地说出某一民族的风格是怎样还有困难，我们在和不同民族的人民接触中却不可能不感觉到他们之间存在着不同的风格。比如，我们不会把维吾尔的舞蹈误作苗族的舞蹈，或是觉得藏族的音乐和朝鲜族的音乐毫无区别。如果这些风格就是共同体的共同心理素质，这种特征在前资本主义时期的共同体就很显著的了。因此，我们在研究前资本主义时期人们共同体的族别问题时应当充分注意这个特征，不但要在文化和生活中去了解一个共同体所特具的风格，而且要考察这种风格是怎样形成，怎样变化，和与其他共同体在这方面的关系和区别是怎样的。
    我们在族别问题研究上的工作做得还不够深入，但是已接触到前资本主义时期和资本主义萌芽时期人们共同体的特征问题。我们体会到不可能在语言、地域、经济联系和心理素质等方面之外去找到一个简单的标志来解决族别问题，同时也不应当用近代民族的标准来要求前资本主义时期和资本主义萌芽时期的人们共同体。我们只有就具体问题进行具体分析，就是就具体的人，按他们社会经济已经发展到的阶段，从语言、地域、经济联系和心理素质发展的情况，去看他们所形成的共同体和这个共同体在历史上的变化。根据我们初步的认识，在人们共同体的发展过程中，各个特征的发展是不平衡的，而且由于复杂的历史条件，有时若干特征的萌芽被遏制而得不到发展的机会，因此任何一个或几个特征上表现了显著的共同性就值得我们注意。
    应当指出，我们进行的族别问题的研究并不是代替各族人民来决定应不应当承认为少数民族或应不应当成为单独民族。民族名称是不能强加于人或由别人来改变的。我们的工作只是在从共同体的形成上来加以研究，提供材料和分析，以便帮助已经提出民族名称的单位，通过协商，自己来考虑是否要认为是少数民族或是否要单独成为一个民族。这些问题的答案是要各族人民自己来做的，这是他们的权利。同时必须承认，族别问题研究对于各族人民自己作出这类决定是有帮助的，因为各民族现在还没有完全脱离过去反动统治所遗留下的孤立、隔阂状态，他们还没有机会充分知道自己的历史，还没有机会和其他单位充分往来。因此，他们还缺乏充分的条件来作出对自己的族别问题的决定。各族人民是需要，也欢迎民族学者在这个问题上为他们服务的。
