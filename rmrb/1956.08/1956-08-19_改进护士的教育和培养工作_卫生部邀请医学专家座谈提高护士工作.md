Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Ministry of Health invited hospital presidents, medical school professors and medical experts in Beijing on the 16th to discuss nursing work.

The symposium was presided over by Li Dequan, Minister of Health. The experts present pointed out that nursing work is an integral professional component of medical work. However, the quality of nursing work is currently low, and nursing work and nurses have not received the due attention from health departments, medical units, and all sectors of society. Many nurses lack professional ideals. At the meeting, experts focused on improving the education and training of nurses, improving the political treatment and working and living conditions of nurses, and strengthening the organizational leadership of nursing work, and made criticisms and suggestions to the Ministry of Health.

Experts believe that improving nurse education is a crucial link in fundamentally improving the level of nurses and improving the quality of nursing work. They pointed out that it is necessary to further improve nurses' scientific knowledge and nursing skills. Many people suggested that nursing schools should be attached to hospitals with suitable conditions in the future to strengthen business education and the connection between theory and practice; consideration should be given to improving the level of in-service intermediate nursing staff by establishing refresher colleges; assistant nurses should be improved through a variety of ways with planned supplementary training.

Many people at the meeting reflected that nurses lack professional ideals, are not content with their work, and regard nursing as a "temporary" and "transitional" occupation. This is certainly related to nurses' ideological understanding; however, the situation in which relevant departments and public opinion do not pay attention to nursing work also seriously exists. At present, there are still many people in society who believe that nursing is a "submissive" profession, and the relevant leading departments do not pay attention to political and ideological education for nurses, nurses' salaries are too low, and special issues such as nurses' vacations, childcare, and night shift rest have not been properly resolved. They requested that the Ministry of Health and relevant departments take measures to improve the many unreasonable situations mentioned above.

Recently, the Ministry of Health, together with the Chinese Nursing Association, established three specialized groups to study and resolve issues in nursing work. The health departments, bureaus, or nursing association branches of Jiangxi, Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Kaifeng, Wuhan, Chengdu and other provinces and cities have also held nursing work symposiums. Currently, the Ministry of Health's special working group is studying and formulating specific plans to improve nursing work based on opinions from all sides.

### 改进护士的教育和培养工作  卫生部邀请医学专家座谈提高护士工作

    改进护士的教育和培养工作
    卫生部邀请医学专家座谈提高护士工作
    新华社17日讯　卫生部十六日邀请在北京的许多医院院长、医学院校教授和医学专家座谈护士工作。
    座谈会由卫生部长李德全主持。到会的专家都指出，护理工作是医疗工作中一个有机的专业的组成部分。但是，目前护理工作质量低，护理工作和护士没有得到卫生部门、医疗单位以及社会各方面应有的重视，许多护士缺乏专业思想。专家们在会上，着重就改进护士的教育和培养工作、改善护士的政治待遇和工作生活条件、加强护理工作的组织领导等问题，对卫生部提出了批评和建议。
    专家们认为，改进护士教育工作，从根本上提高护士的水平，是提高护理工作质量的重要环节。他们指出，必须进一步提高护士的科学知识和护理技术水平。很多人建议，今后护士学校应当附设在有条件的医院内，以加强业务教育和理论与实际的联系；应该考虑用设立进修学院等方式来提高在职中级护理人员的水平；对广大的助理护士应该通过多样的方式有计划地辅助进修，加以提高。
    会上很多人反映，护士们缺乏专业思想，不安心工作，把护士作为“临时”的、“过渡”的职业，这固然同护士的思想认识有关；但是，有关部门和社会舆论不重视护士工作的情况也是严重存在的。目前，社会上仍然有不少人认为护士是一个“受气”的职业，有关领导部门不注意对护士进行政治、思想教育，护士的薪金偏低，护士的休假、育儿、夜班休息等特殊问题没有得到适当的解决。他们要求卫生部及有关部门采取措施，改善上述许多不合理状况。
    最近，卫生部会同中华护士学会成立了三个专门小组，研究解决护士工作中的问题，江西、上海、南京、长沙、开封、武汉、成都等省市的卫生厅、局或护士学会分会，也分别召开了护士工作座谈会。现在，卫生部的专门工作组正根据各方面的意见，研究制定改进护士工作的具体方案。
