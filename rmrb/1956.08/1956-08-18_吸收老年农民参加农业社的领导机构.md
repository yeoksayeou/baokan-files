    Absorb Elderly Farmers into the Leadership of Agricultural Cooperatives
    During my vacation back home, I saw some new developments in the countryside; but I also heard some opinions. Some people say: the production leaders are all young people, they only have enthusiasm and no production experience; they only listen to the instructions from higher authorities (which is of course good), and cannot integrate them with the local situation (which is not good); they don't like to listen to the old farmers, saying that the old people are backward. As a result, the following problems have occurred: the farmers' initiative in production is not enough, and they are only being pushed forward by the leadership; good production experiences cannot be disseminated, or they are applied mechanically, failing to integrate with local experience.
    Therefore, I suggest: each cooperative should preferably absorb experienced and prestigious old farmers to participate in production leadership, especially technical guidance work, to give full play to their enthusiasm and enable production-friendly experiences to play a full role.

    Here in our area, some agricultural cooperatives often hold forums with veteran farmers, which has played a great role in guiding and improving agricultural production techniques. However, in some cooperatives, there are also many phenomena of underestimating the elderly and looking down on the elderly. Because of this, the morale of the elderly has declined. When evaluating advanced producers, the elderly say, "Whether or not we are chosen, it is still the youth, what use are the elderly!" I suggest that all agricultural cooperatives pay attention to allowing capable and experienced people among the elderly to participate in the management of the cooperative, and should never underestimate them.

    吸收老年农民参加农业社的领导机构
    我在假期回家一趟，看到了一些农村的新气象；但也听到了一些意见。有些人说：生产领导都是些年青人，他们光有热情，没有生产经验；他们光听上级的话（这当然是好的），不能和当地情况结合（这就不好了）；他们不爱听老农民的话，说老年人落后。这样一来，就发生了这样的问题：农民的生产主动性不够，光靠领导上推着走；好的生产经验不是不能传播，就是生搬硬套，不能和当地的经验结合应用。
    为此，我建议：每个合作社最好吸收有经验有威望的老农民参加生产领导，特别是技术指导工作，把他们的积极性发扬起来，使有利于生产的经验充分发挥作用。

    在我们这里，有些农业社常开老农座谈会，对于领导和改进农业生产技术起了很大作用。但是，在某些社里，轻视老年人、看不起老年人的现象也很多。为此，老年人的情绪低落了。在评选先进生产者的时候，老年人都说：“选不选还是青年，老年人有啥用！”我建议各个农业社注意让老年人当中能干的有经验的人来参加管理合作社，绝不应该轻视他们。　杨兴禄
