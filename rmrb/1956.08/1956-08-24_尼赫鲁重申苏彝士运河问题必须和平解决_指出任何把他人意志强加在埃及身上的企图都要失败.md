Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 23rd: According to Delhi newspapers, Prime Minister Nehru, while speaking to the Congress Parliamentary Party on August 22nd, reiterated India's position: the Suez Canal issue must be resolved peacefully, because any attempt to impose the will of others on Egypt is bound to fail.

Nehru said that the London Conference was not a representative conference because the main party, Egypt, did not participate. He said that India's attitude towards the conference was to use it to seek a peaceful solution, although India had hoped that the conference would have a broader foundation.

Nehru said that the Indian proposal put forward by Menon at the London Conference was a "general approach" to the entire issue. The advantage of this method is that the Suez Canal issue must be resolved by peaceful means. He said: Any other method would be self-defeating, and the desired goal of guaranteeing the freedom of navigation of all countries in the Suez Canal would not be achieved.

Nehru believes that there is no danger of armed conflict over the Suez issue, although the level of tension may increase. He said: "There is no room for compromise between coercion and solution - and the solution must have consultation as a prerequisite."

He said that the main achievement of the London Conference was that most participating countries recognized that coercion and the use of violence must be avoided.

    尼赫鲁重申苏彝士运河问题必须和平解决
    指出任何把他人意志强加在埃及身上的企图都要失败
    新华社新德里23日电　据德里报纸报道：尼赫鲁总理八月二十二日在对国大党议会党团讲话的时候重申印度的立场是：苏彝士运河问题必须用和平方式来解决，因为任何把他人的意志强加在埃及身上的企图都是要失败的。
    尼赫鲁说，伦敦会议不是一个有代表性的会议，因为主要的一方埃及没有参加。他说，印度对会议的态度是要利用这个会议来求得和平解决，虽然印度曾经希望会议具有更加广泛的基础。
    尼赫鲁说，梅农在伦敦会议上提出的印度建议是一种对待整个问题的“一般办法”。这种办法的优点在于：必须用和平手段来解决苏彝士运河问题。他说：任何其他办法都会是自招失败，结果会使得所要达到的保证各国在苏彝士运河的航行自由这个目的无法达到。
    尼赫鲁认为在苏彝士问题上不会有发生武装冲突的危险，虽然局势紧张的程度可能增加。他说：“胁迫和解决二者之间是没有妥协的余地的——而解决必须以协商作为先决条件。”
    他说，伦敦会议的主要成就是大多数参加国家认识到了必须避免胁迫，避免使用暴力。
