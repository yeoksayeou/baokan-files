Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Qingdao City's suburban Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative has had a bumper harvest of hops. Now, on sunny days, nearly two hundred female members of the cooperative are harvesting hops on the seemingly endless hop trellises. This year, the total output of hops planted by the cooperative can reach 400,000 jin, an increase of 60,000 jin over last year.

The hops factory newly built last year by the state-owned Qingdao Brewery in this cooperative, which can dry 14,000 jin of fresh hops per day, has officially started production this year. In addition to meeting the needs of the Qingdao Brewery, the hops produced by this cooperative this year can also supply a portion to the breweries in Beijing and Shenyang.

    青岛啤酒花丰收
    据新华社讯　青岛市郊区建国农业生产合作社的啤酒花丰收。现在，每逢晴天，就有近两百个女社员在一眼望不到边的啤酒花架子上收摘啤酒花。今年这个社种植的啤酒花的总产量可以达到四十万斤，比去年增产六万斤。
    国营青岛啤酒厂去年在这个社里新建的一座每天可以烘干一万四千斤鲜啤酒花的酒花厂，今年已经正式投入生产。这个社今年生产的啤酒花除满足青岛啤酒厂的需要外，还可供应北京和沈阳市的啤酒厂一部分。
