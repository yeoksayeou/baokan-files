    Talking About Eyeglasses
    Gao Shiqi
    Eyeglasses are citizens of the glass kingdom. For a long time, they have served humanity's eyesight.
    All those who are nearsighted or farsighted cannot live without them. Without them, they would lose their ability to work and would be unable to read and write.
    Before the invention of eyeglasses, ancient scholars often complained of failing eyesight in old age.
    The world's first eyeglass – a monocle – was made of emerald. A nearsighted Roman emperor used it, closing one eye to watch gladiators duel.
    After this emperor's death, it took 1300 years for real eyeglasses to appear.
    These real eyeglasses were made of glass crystal.
    Glass crystal, like natural crystal, is a pure and transparent substance.
    But it is easier to melt than natural crystal and easier to accept various processing methods: blowing, polishing, and carving.
    After eyeglasses were invented, people did not know how to wear them properly. Some sewed them onto their hats; some put them in iron rings; some embedded them in leather straps.
    Another three hundred years passed before this problem was finally solved.
    This was in the sixteenth century.
    At that time, people would go to eyeglasses shops to freely choose eyeglasses without undergoing examination by an ophthalmologist.
    People did not understand why wearing eyeglasses helped eyesight.
    The first person to uncover this secret was the German astronomer Kepler, who told us that whether in humans or animals, there is a crystalline lens inside the eye that is convex on both sides.
    In farsighted people, this crystalline lens is not convex enough, and not enough light is gathered, so the eyes see things blurry. Therefore, adding a glass crystal that is convex on both sides can remedy this defect.
    In nearsighted people, the opposite is true. Their crystalline lens is excessively convex, and light is excessively concentrated, so they must wear lenses that are concave on both sides.
    Scientific progress is advancing rapidly, and the construction of eyeglasses is becoming more and more sophisticated.
    Today, we have eyeglasses that have no frames and do not need to be rested on the bridge of the nose. Instead, they are lenses embedded under the eyelids, close to the eyeballs. They will never fall off or break. If you see someone wearing these eyeglasses, you will not be able to tell.
    The science of eyeglasses is a science that truly benefits mankind.
    In the eyeglasses family, there are also telescopes, microscopes, cameras, movie cameras, electron microscopes, and televisions. Some expand and enhance human vision; some reflect people, scenery, and storylines for people to see. They have all made contributions to mankind, but they are not within the scope of this article, so I will not discuss them further.

    谈眼镜
    高士其
    眼镜是玻璃国的公民。很久以来，它就为人类的视力服务。
    一切近视眼和远视眼的人，都离不开它。没有它，他们就要失去工作能力，不能看书和写字了。
    在眼镜未发明以前，古代的学者，常常因为年老眼花而诉苦。
    世界上第一片眼镜——单眼镜，是用绿宝石造成的。当时有一位近视眼的罗马皇帝曾用过它，闭上一只眼睛，来观看剑客们的决斗。
    这位皇帝死后，1300年才有真正的眼镜出现。
    这真正的眼镜，是用玻璃水晶造成的。
    玻璃水晶和天然水晶一样，是纯洁而透明的物体。
    但它比天然水晶容易熔化，也容易接受各种加工：吹制、琢磨和雕刻。
    有了眼镜以后，人们还不知道怎样戴它才好，有的人把它缝在帽子上头；有的人把它装在铁圈里面；有的人把它镶在皮带上面。
    又过了三百年的时光，这个问题总算解决了。
    这是十六世纪的事。
    那时候，人们购买眼镜，都是到眼镜铺子里去自由选择，并没有经过眼科大夫的检查。
    为什么带眼镜会帮助视力呢？人们还不明白。
    首先揭穿这个秘密的人，是德国的天文学家克布列尔，他告诉我们，不论是人或是动物，眼睛里面都有一种两面凸起的水晶体。
    远视眼的人，这水晶体凸起不够，光线收集不足，因而眼睛看东西都是模糊不清的。所以要给它加上一个两面凸起的玻璃水晶，才能补救这种缺陷。
    近视眼的人，恰恰相反，他的水晶体过份凸起，光线过份集中，所以要给它戴上两面凹下去的镜片。
    科学的进步，日新月异，眼镜的构造也越来越精巧。
    今天，我们有这样一种眼镜：它是没有镜框子，也不用架在鼻梁上，而是镶装在眼皮下面，紧贴着眼球的一种镜片。永远不会掉下来，也不会打碎。如果你看戴这种眼镜的人，是不会看得出来的。
    眼镜的科学，是真正为人类谋福利的科学。
    在眼镜的大家庭里，还有望远镜、显微镜、照像机、电影机、电子显微镜和电视机等；有的扩大和增强人类的视力；有的把人物，风景、故事情节都反映出来，给人们看，它们对人类都立过功勋，但它们不在本文围范之内，恕我不多谈了。
