Xinhua News Agency report: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently issued instructions requiring supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions to actively assist disaster victims in their production self-salvation efforts.

The instructions stated that due to the impact of typhoons and continuous rain, more than ten provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, have suffered varying degrees of disaster. Supply and marketing cooperatives in affected areas should prioritize production and disaster relief as an important current task and actively cooperate with the rescue of crops and the aftermath work in disaster areas.

The instructions pointed out: 1. Vigorously cooperate in rescuing crops and maintaining agricultural production. In areas repairing dikes, dams, canals, embankments, and undertaking flood prevention and drainage, promptly supply tools and equipment as needed, as well as daily necessities required by laborers.

2.  Provide as much additional fertilizer as possible for damaged crops, and make every effort to protect draught animals according to local conditions.

3. In areas where houses have been destroyed, efforts should be made to supply building materials (bricks, tiles, stone, bamboo, wood, grass, etc.) to help the masses rebuild their homes.

4. Support and guide the masses in disaster areas to develop various sideline and handicraft productions. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should, as far as possible, meet the needs of farmers in disaster areas for sideline and handicraft raw materials and actively sell their products. However, in their work, they must strengthen the guidance of disaster victims' sideline and handicraft production based on past experience, in accordance with the needs of the state and the people, and in combination with market conditions, to ensure product specifications, quality, and sales.

5. All levels of cooperatives should also pay special attention to the market supply work in disaster-stricken areas, actively restore the supply and marketing cooperatives and retail outlets destroyed by the disaster, deeply understand the needs of the people in disaster areas, and meet the needs of disaster victims.
