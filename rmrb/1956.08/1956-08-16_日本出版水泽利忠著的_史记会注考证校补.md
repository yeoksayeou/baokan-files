The "Shiki Kaichu Kōshō Kōho" (Historical Records: Collected Annotations, Textual Research, Collations, and Supplements), written by Mizusawa Toshitada, lecturer at Tokyo University of Education in Japan, has been published successively since last year and is scheduled to be completed next year. The entire book will consist of fifteen volumes, of which nine have already been published. This book is based on Takigawa Kametaro's "Shiki Kaichu Kōshō" (Historical Records: Collected Annotations and Textual Research) with additions, supplements, and corrections. There are many errors in Takigawa's book, often mistaking "Suoyin" for "Jijie," and "Zhengyi" for "Kaozheng." This book corrects them one by one. The lost texts of "Shiji Zhengyi" (Historical Records: Righteous Meaning) collected are also about three hundred more than in Takigawa's book. The materials used are six Song editions, three Yuan editions, ten Ming editions, and two ancient Japanese editions. Among the Song editions, there is a large-character "Jijie" (Collected Annotations) edition published by Shao Wu Zhu Zhongfeng in the tenth year of Shaoxing in the Southern Song Dynasty, which has never been seen in the records of Chinese bibliophiles. The materials used to collect the lost texts of "Shiji Zhengyi" (Historical Records: Righteous Meaning) include twenty-six types, such as the "Shiji" transcriptions of Taoyuan, Huanyun, and Yingfang, the "Shiji Kao Yi" (Historical Records: Textual Differences) jointly compiled by Ōshima Chūsen and his son Taonen, and the anonymous "Boshi Jia Ben Shiji Yi Zi" (Historical Records: Variant Characters in the Scholars' Family Edition), which preserve many ancient annotations and variant texts.

    日本出版水泽利忠著的
    “史记会注考证校补”
　　日本东京教育大学讲师水泽利忠著的“史记会注考证校补”一书，从去年起开始陆续出版，预定明年出齐。全书共十五册，现已出版九册。这部书是以泷川龟太郎的“史记会注考证”作底本，加以增补校订而成的。泷川书中错误的地方很多，常把索隐误作集解，正义误作考证，本书都一一加以改正；采录的史记正义佚文，也比泷川书多出约三百条。所根据的资料，计宋版六种，元版三种，明版十种，日本古刊本二种。宋版中有一种是南宋绍兴十年邵武朱中奉刊大字集解本，从来不见于我国藏书家的著录。采录史记正义佚文的资料计二十六种，其中像桃源、幻云、英房的史记抄，大岛贽川、桃年父子合编的“史记考异”，无名氏的“博士家本史记异字”，都保存了很多的古注和异文。　　（然）
