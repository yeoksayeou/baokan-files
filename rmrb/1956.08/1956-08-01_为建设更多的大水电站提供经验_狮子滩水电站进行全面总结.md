Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing -- A group of specialized engineering technicians and management cadres organized by the Shizitan Hydropower Engineering Bureau are comprehensively summarizing the construction experience of the Shizitan Hydropower Station.

The Shizitan Hydropower Station is a large hydropower station designed and constructed by Chinese technicians under the guidance of Soviet experts, and it is also the most important power station on the first river in China to undergo cascade development. The amount of engineering work required to build this hydropower station was very large, and the construction technology was also very complex. Therefore, systematically summarizing the construction experience of this hydropower station can not only serve as a reference for China to build more large-scale hydropower stations in the future, but also as an important reference material for carrying out cascade development on other rivers.

    为建设更多的大水电站提供经验
    狮子滩水电站进行全面总结
    据新华社重庆讯　狮子滩水力发电工程局组织的一批专职工程技术人员和管理干部，正在全面地总结狮子滩水力发电站的施工经验。
    狮子滩水电站是在苏联专家指导下，由我国技术人员自己设计和建设的一座很大的水电站，也是我国第一条进行梯级开发的河流上最重要的一个电站。建设这座水电站的工程量很大，施工技术也很复杂。因此，系统地总结这个水电站的建设经验，不仅可以作为我国将来建设更多的大型水力发电站的参考，也是在其他河流上进行梯级开发的重要参考资料。
