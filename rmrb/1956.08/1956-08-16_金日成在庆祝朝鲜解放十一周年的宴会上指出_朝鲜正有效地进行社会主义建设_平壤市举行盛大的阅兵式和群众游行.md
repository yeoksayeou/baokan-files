Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held a grand banquet in Pyongyang today to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation.

More than 300 people attended the banquet, including leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Supreme People's Assembly, Deputy Premiers of the Cabinet, Cabinet Ministers, leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations, generals of the People's Army, and representatives from all walks of life.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers were also invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet. He first extended his heartfelt thanks to the great Soviet people, the liberators of the Korean people, and expressed his gratitude for the internationalist assistance from the people of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and China.

Kim Il-sung said that today the Korean people are effectively carrying out socialist construction to build a material foundation for a unified fatherland. Encouraged by the assistance of the fraternal countries, the Korean people have completed most of the tasks stipulated in the post-war Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the national economy. This proves that we can complete or overfulfill the Three-Year Plan.

Referring to the visit of the Korean government delegation to the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, Kim Il-sung said that this visit received the support and sympathy of these countries for our just cause. The new aid given to the Korean people by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries will make a great contribution to the future development of the Korean people's economy and the improvement of people's living standards.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that the Korean people's desire for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland will surely be realized. We have always unswervingly adhered to the policy of realizing the reunification of the fatherland by the Korean people themselves through consultation and cooperation, without allowing any foreign interference. This policy has received the unanimous support of all Korean people and peace-loving people around the world.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that recently, the British, French, and American imperialists' opposition to Egypt's just measures to nationalize the Suez Canal has caused unnecessary turmoil and deepened the tense situation in the Middle East. However, this can only arouse even more anger among the people of the world towards the imperialists.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the Korean people will strengthen the friendship, unity, and mutual assistance relationship with the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and China, and continue to wage a strong struggle for the reunification of the fatherland, lasting world peace and security, and the happiness of mankind.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: A grand military parade and a mass parade of more than 300,000 people were held in Pyongyang this morning to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation.

Korean state leaders, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, reviewed the military parade on the rostrum of Central Square and inspected the marching masses. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers headed by General Ren Rong were invited to attend the ceremony.

The military parade began at 8 a.m. General Kim Kwang-hyup, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, inspected the troops of various services and delivered a speech. Then, students from the People's Army Officer School and military schools of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, tank units, motorized units, and artillery units marched across the square. At the same time, fighter jets and bombers of the People's Air Force flew over the square in neat formations like lightning, and the square resounded with warm cheers and applause.

The mass parade then began. The working people of Pyongyang wore festive costumes and held bouquets and colorful flags high. Workers held up charts showing the increase in production over the past three years, celebrating the victory of the Korean people in completing the industrial output value plan in the Three-Year Plan four and a half months ahead of schedule on August 14.

    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成今天在平壤举行了庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放十一周年的盛大宴会。
    朝鲜劳动党和最高人民会议领导人，内阁副首相们，内阁各相，各民主党派和社会团体的负责人，人民军将领以及各界代表等三百多人出席了宴会。

    金日成首相在宴会开始的时候发表了演说。他首先向朝鲜人民的解放者——伟大的苏联人民致以衷心的感谢，向以苏联、中国为首的各兄弟国家人民的国际主义援助表示感谢。
    金日成说，今天朝鲜人民正在为建立统一祖国的物质基础而有效地进行着社会主义的建设，为各兄弟国家的援助所鼓舞的朝鲜人民已经完成了战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划规定的大部分任务。这证明我们能够完成或超额完成三年计划。
    金日成谈到朝鲜政府代表团到苏联等各兄弟国家的访问时说，这次访问得到这些国家对我们的正义事业的支持和同情。苏联和各人民民主国家给朝鲜人民的新的援助，将对今后朝鲜人民经济的发展和人民生活的提高作出巨大贡献。

    金日成指出，最近，英、法、美帝国主义者们反对埃及把苏彝士运河国有化的正当措施引起了无谓的骚动，加深了中近东的紧张局势，可是，这只能引起全世界人民对帝国主义者们的更加愤怒。
    金日成首相说，朝鲜人民将加强同以苏联、中国为首的各兄弟国家的友谊团结和互助关系，并且为祖国的统一和世界持久和平和安全以及人类的幸福而继续进行坚强的斗争。
