The Struggle to Improve Product Quality
Lin Yuan, Secretary of the General Branch of the CPC Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory

    Not long ago, the high-voltage switches produced by the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory were often "unable to open" or "unable to close." Users criticized our products as "patchwork" and "shoddily made." In the factory area, one could see products returned from various locations for repair everywhere. The factory also had to maintain a "repair brigade" of 150 people to run around repairing the high-voltage switches that had already left the factory.

    To solve the problem of product quality, last year we selected experienced technical personnel and leaders to organize a product quality visiting group to visit key users. In four months, we visited 23 cities, 34 factories and basic construction units, and collected 176 opinions on improving quality. We studied these opinions and adopted a series of improvement measures. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the situation of poor product quality has changed. Each product leaving the factory undergoes strict technical inspection and can basically meet the national technical standards, and has begun to receive praise from users.

    In the first half of this year, due to the high enthusiasm of the workers for socialist competition, our factory overfulfilled the national plan every month, and the quality has also been improved. The assembly repair rate of main products has been reduced to 4%, and the scrap rate of processed parts has also been reduced from 1.7% to 1%.

    Solving Problems Ideologically

    In the process of improving product quality, we fought against the ideas of unilaterally pursuing quantity and neglecting quality. Unilaterally pursuing quantity is a historical problem in our factory. Even when the new upsurge of socialist competition began, everyone still emphasized more and faster too much, and said very little about good and economical. Under the guidance of this idea, a series of biases arose in the competition. For example, when the insulation workshop was processing an arc extinguisher, in order to pursue more and faster, unqualified materials were used, resulting in the production of more than 800 defective products, causing the state to lose thousands of yuan. Some workshops produced a large number of defective products because of greed for quantity, which disrupted the operation plan, which affected both quality and output. These facts prompted us to recall the painful lessons of the past. We mobilized within the Party and educated all Party members in the factory to remember these lessons and pay attention to seeking more and faster on the basis of good and economical. In the advanced producer movement, we made ensuring quality the primary condition for competition. We promptly praised and rewarded those who have made significant achievements in improving product quality. When proposing rationalization proposals, we also focused on improving quality. We have successively put forward 56 quality-related topics, which have been discussed among the workers and masses, and 37 have now been resolved.

    In this way, we have gradually guided the enthusiasm of the workers and the masses to constantly care about and improve product quality. Improving tools and operating methods around the goal of improving product quality has become the atmosphere of the entire factory. In the first quarter of this year, 357 advanced producers who had made significant achievements in improving quality emerged in the factory. Many workers have not produced a single defective product since January this year. Many advanced producers have solved quality problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past. Labor model Yin Baoyu and workshop technician Shi Jinsheng jointly created the "nesting tool lathe method," which completely met the quality requirements of iron plate parts that were most prone to defects in the past, and completely eliminated defective products.

    Exchanging Experience in Improving Quality

    In order to exchange advanced experience in improving product quality, we conducted more than 50 performances of advanced experience in each workshop. After learning the "nesting tool lathe method" performed by Yin Baoyu, Cao Shenghai, a worker in the complete set workshop, created a set of tools with the help of a technician to solve the quality problems of the 19 types of iron plate parts in this workshop that are most difficult to guarantee quality. Zeng Fuheng, a lathe operator in the high-voltage workshop, often produced defective products in the past. After learning Yin Baoyu's tool lathe method, he has not produced defective products for more than four months.

    We also sent people to other factories to learn experience in improving quality. In order to solve the quality problem of welded parts, we sent a study group composed of welders, technicians, and inspectors to Dalian Shipyard to learn advanced welding methods, and initially stabilized the quality of welded parts. In order to ensure the quality of the compressed air switch trial-produced this year, we sent people to Xiaofengman Power Station to study.

    Strengthening Supervision of Product Quality

    Strengthening the supervision of product quality has a direct effect on improving product quality. We have carried out the following work in this regard:

    (1) Carry out excellent inspector competitions. Since the start of the competition, inspectors have not only been able to adhere to quality standards, but also can help workers improve product quality in a timely manner. Once, the cold work workshop welded a batch of iron frames. The quality of the first one was not good, and it had not been qualified after being reworked for half a day. In order to complete the task, the workshop foreman asked Liu Xiande, the leader of the inspection team, to "let it pass." Liu Xiande firmly disagreed. He went deep into the workers and discussed with them, suggesting that they adopt the segmented welding method. With the support of the workshop technician, he helped the workers adopt this method, so that this batch of products never had any defective products again, and Liu Xiande has always maintained the title of excellent inspector. The inspectors and production workers in the high-voltage workshop signed a "work inspection contract" to ensure that there would be no false inspections, no missed inspections, and no defective products. After signing the contract, the workers who usually produce many defective products rarely produce defective products.

    (2) Establish defective product analysis stations in workshops. The analysis station is led by the inspection section and the workshop director, and is composed of the workshop inspection team leader, inspectors, and technicians. Its task is mainly to conduct education, analyze the causes of defective products, and put forward improvement measures with the "defective product prevention notice." The defective product rate of welded parts in the complete set workshop used to be as high as 50%. After the analysis station put forward improvement measures, the situation of a large number of reworks was changed.

    (3) Improve inspection methods. The past inspection method was to inspect after all parts were completed, so it could not play a preventive role. Not long ago, we implemented a regional cyclical inspection system. During the process of work, inspectors learned about the quality situation in a timely manner and provided assistance and correction at any time.

    Improving the Technical Level of Employees

    Improving the technical level of employees is an important prerequisite for improving product quality. We have done a lot of work in technical education. According to different types of work, 13 spare-time technical education classes have been organized, and a regular learning system has been established. Various forms of technical education are also adopted in the production process.

    Many workshops have technical newspapers. This is a blackboard newspaper that introduces technical theories and advanced experience, and is jointly organized by the propaganda committee of the workshop Party branch, the technical learning committee of the Youth League, the cultural and educational committee of the trade union, and the workshop technician. It often introduces relevant technical knowledge based on the key technical problems existing in production; it often systematically introduces technical theories by type of work; and it also introduces workers' advanced experience in a timely manner. This technical newspaper was first founded by the pilot workshop. The technical newspaper of this workshop is generally published twice a week, and each issue can solve several technical topics, which is very popular among workers. After each issue is published, workers surround and copy relevant technical knowledge and advanced experience, and people from other workshops also run over to copy. In the technical upgrading examination in May, the workers in the pilot workshop all got full marks and were generally upgraded. Now eight workshops have started technical newspapers, and the effect is generally good.

    We also organize workshop technicians to conduct technical education to workers anytime and anywhere according to the key problems existing in the current quality. Advanced worker and technician Yu Wanhe explained the Soviet Union's process regulations on spring manufacturing and heat treatment to the workers in a few months, helping the workers master this new technology, so that the factory basically eliminated the phenomenon of inaccurate spring tension and frequent breakage. Since April this year, we have respectively organized senior workers and junior workers, technical workers and apprentices, technical personnel and senior workers, etc. to sign some technical learning contracts. Through these contracts, apprentices will be promoted to one or two levels, and technical workers and technicians will also be generally promoted to one level. According to the principle of "apprentices are upgraded, masters are rewarded," we stipulate that the taught workers will be promoted by one level, and the person in charge of teaching can get a bonus of up to 24 yuan.

    We have also done some work in technical management and other aspects. The main thing is to systematically carry out the "six determinations" work of determining design, determining process, determining materials, determining tools, determining technical conditions, and determining inspection for 21 kinds of products with unstable quality. The five products with technical rectification work nearing completion have stably reached the national standards for the products leaving the factory due to having the correct process methods. At the same time, we also tried to overcome the problem of rush and chaos in management, and now we have basically eliminated the phenomenon of rush at the end of the month and working overtime. This also has a significant effect on improving product quality.

    At present, the product quality of our factory has indeed improved compared with the past, but it does not mean that there are no problems. For example, the technical rectification work that can ensure product quality is still relatively slow, the quality of many products is still not stable enough, strict process discipline has not yet been established, the technical level is still far from the needs of production, comprehensive technical transformation has not yet been carried out, and there are still many shortcomings in the work of promoting advanced experience. These all require us to carry out a lot of work more deeply and painstakingly, and at the same time, we must prevent the possible growth of pride and complacency, so as to continuously improve product quality.

    提高产品质量的斗争
    中共沈阳高压开关厂总支书记　林源
    不久以前，沈阳高压开关厂生产的高压开关还是“开不开”、“关不上”的。用户批评我们的产品“七并八凑”、“粗制滥造”。在厂区内，到处可以看到由各处退回来返修的产品。厂里还不得不经常保持着一个一百五十人的“返修大队”，随时跑到各地去修理已经出厂的高压开关。
    为了解决产品质量问题，去年我们选派了有经验的技术人员和领导人员组织了产品质量访问组，到重点用户去访问。四个月内，共访问了二十三个城市、三十四个工厂和基本建设单位，征集了176条关于改进质量的意见。我们研究了这些意见，采取了一系列的改进措施，从去年第四季度以来，产品质量低劣的情况有了改变。每台出厂的产品经过严格的技术检验，基本上都能符合国家技术标准，在用户中开始获得好评。
    今年上半年，由于职工社会主义竞赛热情高涨，我们工厂月月超额完成国家计划，质量也更加提高了。主要产品装配返修率降低到4％，加工部件的废品率也由1.7％降低到1％。
    从思想上解决问题
    我们在提高产品质量的过程中，同片面追求数量、忽视质量的思想进行了斗争。片面追求数量，在我们工厂里是历史性的问题，就是在社会主义竞赛新高涨开始的时候，大家也还过多地强调了多和快，对好和省说得很少。在这种思想的指导下，竞赛中产生了一系列的偏向。如绝缘车间在加工一种灭弧器的时候，为贪图多、快，竟采用了不合格的材料，结果生产出八百多个废品，给国家造成了上千元的损失。有的车间因为贪多，生产了大量废品，结果打乱了作业计划，既影响质量，又影响产量。这些事实促使我们回忆了过去的惨痛教训。我们在党内进行了动员，教育全厂党员记住这些教训，注意在又好、又省的基础上求多、求快。在先进生产者运动中，我们把确保质量作为竞赛的首要条件。在提高产品质量方面有显著成绩的人，我们都及时给予表扬和奖励。在提合理化建议课题的时候，也将重点放在提高质量方面。我们先后提出了五十六件有关质量的课题，都在职工群众中进行了讨论，现在已经解决了三十七件。
    这样，我们就把职工群众的热情逐渐引导到经常关心和提高产品质量这方面来。围绕着提高产品质量的目标来改进工具和操作方法，已经成为全厂的风气。在今年第一季度，全厂就涌现出改善质量有显著成绩的先进生产者三百五十七名。许多工人从今年一月到现在没有出过一件废品。许多先进生产者解决了过去长期无法解决的质量问题。劳动模范殷宝玉和车间技术员史今生共同创造的“套料车刀法”，使过去最容易出废品的铁板类部件完全达到了质量要求，并且全部消灭了废品。
  交流提高质量的经验
    为了交流提高产品质量的先进经验，我们在各个车间分别进行了五十多次先进经验的表演。成套车间工人曹盛海学习了殷宝玉表演的“套料车刀法”以后，在技术员的帮助下创造了一套工具，解决了本车间最难保证质量的十九种铁板类部件的质量问题。高压车间车工曾福恒过去常出废品，学习殷宝玉的车刀法以后，不出废品已经有四个多月了。
    我们还派人到厂外去学习提高质量的经验。为了解决电焊件质量问题，曾经派出电焊工人、技术员、检查员组成的学习组，到大连造船公司学习了先进的焊接方法，初步稳定了电焊件的质量。为了保证今年试制的压缩空气开关的质量，我们派了人到小丰满发电站去学习。
  加强产品质量的监督
    加强对产品质量的监督，对提高产品质量有直接的作用。我们在这方面进行了下列工作：
    （一）开展优秀检查员竞赛。竞赛开始以来，检查员们不仅能够坚持质量标准，还能及时帮助工人提高产品质量。冷作车间有一次焊接一批铁架子，头一台质量不好，返修半天还没有合格，车间工长为了完成任务，要求检查组长刘显德“放过去”。刘显德坚决不同意。他深入到工人中去同他们商量，建议他们采用分段焊接法。在车间技术员支持下，他帮助工人采用了这个方法，使这批产品一直没有再出现废品，刘显德也一直保持了优秀检查员的称号。高压车间的检查员和生产工人签订了“工检合同”，互相保证不错检、不漏检，不出废品。签订合同以后，平常出废品多的工人，也很少出废品了。
    （二）在车间建立废品分析站。分析站是在检查科和车间主任领导下，由车间检查组长、检查员、技术员组成的。它的任务主要是进行教育，分析废品产生的原因，用“废品预防通知单”提出改进措施。成套车间电焊件过去的废品率高达50％，经过分析站提出改进措施以后，改变了大批返修的情况。
    （三）改进检查方法。过去的检查方法是在部件全部完成以后才进行检查，因此就起不到预防的作用。不久以前，我们实行了区域循回检查制度，在工序进行中，检查员就及时了解质量情况，随时进行帮助、纠正。
  提高职工技术水平
    提高职工技术水平是提高产品质量的重要前提。我们在技术教育方面进行了不少工作。根据不同工种，组织了十三个业余技术教育班，并且建立了正规的学习制度，在生产过程中也采用各种不同的形式进行技术教育。
    许多车间都举办了技术报。这是一种介绍技术理论和先进经验的黑板报，由车间党支部宣传委员、青年团技术学习委员、工会文教委员和车间技术员共同主办的。它经常根据生产中存在的技术关键问题，介绍有关的技术知识；经常分工种系统介绍技术理论；还及时介绍工人的先进经验。这种技术报是试制车间首先创办的。这个车间的技术报一般每周出两期，每期都能解决几个技术专题，很受工人欢迎。每期出版以后，工人都围上来抄录有关技术知识和先进经验，其他车间也有人跑来抄录。五月份技术升级考试中，试制车间的工人都得了满分，普遍升了级。现在已经有八个车间创办了技术报，效果一般都好。
    我们还组织车间技术员，根据当前质量方面存在的关键问题，随时随地向工人进行技术教育。先进工作者、技术员于万河，在几个月的时间内，向工人们讲解了苏联关于弹簧制造和热处理的工艺规程，帮助工人们掌握了这门新技术，使厂里基本上消灭了弹簧拉力不准和经常折断的现象。今年四月份以来，我们分别组织高级工和低级工、技术工人和徒工、技术人员和高级工等签订了一些技术学习合同。通过这些合同，徒工将提高一级或二级，技术工人和技术员也将普遍提高一级。根据“徒弟升级，师傅受奖”的原则，我们规定被教的工人晋一级，负责教学的人最多可以得奖金二十四元。
    在技术管理等方面，我们也作了一些工作。主要的是开始有系统地对二十一种质量不够稳定的产品，进行了定设计、定工艺、定材料、定工具、定技术条件和定检查等“六定”工作。技术整顿工作接近结束的五种产品，由于有了正确的工艺方法，出厂产品已经稳定地达到了国家标准。同时，我们也设法克服了管理工作中突击混乱的毛病，现在已经基本上消除了月末突击和加班加点的现象。这对提高产品质量也有不小的作用。
    目前，我们工厂的产品质量的确比过去有了进步，但是不等于说已经没有问题。例如，可以保证产品质量的技术整顿工作进行得还比较迟缓，许多产品的质量还不够稳定，严格的工艺纪律还没有树立起来，技术水平和生产的需要还相差很远，全面的技术改造还没有开展，推广先进经验的工作中还有许多缺点。这些都需要我们更加深入艰苦地进行许多工作，同时要防止可能滋长的骄傲自满情绪，以便不断地提高产品质量。
