    Guests to Karamay all want to go to Bitumen Mountain to take a look. Under the intense sun, when people step onto this hill made of accumulated asphalt, they feel as if they are walking on a carpet, their feet feeling soft. On the slopes of this hill, you can see gelatinous asphalt oozing out from the cracks. At the top of the hill are two oil springs, bubbling with dark brown crude oil. In the past, the Uyghur people who collected crude oil and mined asphalt here called it "Karamay." "Karamay" means "black oil."
    From a geological point of view, crude oil seeping to the surface may be a phenomenon that occurs after the underground oil storage structure is damaged by orogenic movement. It was based on this estimate that some people in the past believed that the oil field here no longer had industrial value.
    Last July, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration sent a youth shock drilling team to drill the first exploratory well here. After this exploratory well was drilled to the target layer, crude oil at the bottom of the well gushed out of the oil pipe like a fountain. The youth shock team members waved their hats and cheered on the drilling platform. They sat around the campfire discussing the future prospects of Karamay until dawn.
    The prospects that the young workers longed for did not fall through. Following the oil production of the first exploratory well, the second, third, fourth... exploratory wells that were successively drilled all produced crude oil; and the oil production of each well was greater than the last. The first half of this year was the crucial period to determine whether the Karamay oil field had industrial oil-bearing value. Karamay left a glorious record in its history during this period. The exciting news came one after another, and before the sound of gongs and drums celebrating the oil production of this exploratory well had subsided, the sound of gongs and drums celebrating the oil production of another exploratory well rang again. Congratulatory letters and telegrams poured in. Karamay was immersed in an unprecedented atmosphere of joy.
    Currently, all of the more than twenty exploratory wells that have been drilled in Karamay have produced crude oil and oil gas; fifteen exploratory wells have already self-flowed crude oil. These facts prove that the Karamay oil field has not only not been destroyed, but is also an oil field with abundant reserves and a large area.
    Starting in the second half of this year, the drilling work in the Karamay oil area has begun to take big strides to explore the boundaries of the oil field. The first exploratory well drilled ten kilometers away to investigate the boundaries of the oil field has already shown good oil sand and oil gas. After being identified by geologists, it was determined that the oil layer under the well is exactly the same as the oil layer in the area where oil has already been produced. An area that had originally been determined as the boundary of the oil field and was prepared for the construction of houses recently produced crude oil when drilling a water well to supply water for the project. This forced the relevant departments to reconsider the location of the buildings.
    In Urho, more than 100 kilometers northeast of Karamay, geological exploration personnel had discovered good structures and outcropping asphalt during previous general surveys and detailed measurements. Based on the information they obtained, they judged that Urho not only had a great hope of containing oil, but was also likely to be connected to Karamay. The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has already linked the names of these two places together and called it the "Karamay-Urho oil area." When the reporter recently visited Urho, he visited the asphalt veins that geologists were very interested in. This asphalt vein is as long as forty kilometers. The crude oil squeezed out of the rock cracks has been oxidized and turned into solid asphalt. Geologists believe that this solidified asphalt has sealed the underground oil storage structure; the structure has not been damaged. This year, the exploration team conducting structural shallow drilling in Urho has already drilled crude oil and oil sand in several places. Now, drilling rigs for exploratory wells have been erected on the shores of the beautiful Ailik Lake in Urho. These exploratory wells will further confirm the oil storage situation in this area.
    Oil has also been discovered in the area between Karamay and Urho. When the reporter passed by here, he saw a half-filled pit of crude oil in a sand pit next to the road. The crude oil overflowing on the beach had turned into a solid. It is said that after the shallow drilling team completed the structural shallow drilling here and withdrew, crude oil flowed out of the drill hole. People only noticed it and plugged the drill hole. These scenes make people feel that this place is like an oil sea, and oil is buried everywhere. The claim that Urho and Karamay are connected seems to be well-founded.
    How big is the Karamay oil field, and where are its boundaries? It is still deeply uncertain. Writers and reporters living in Karamay recently invited the geological engineers here to introduce the prospects of the oil field. When talking about the possible oil-bearing area of this oil area, the engineer moved his palm from the northwest corner of the Zhungar Basin topographic map to the northeast corner, and then drew a large circle on the map with his finger. He circled almost all of the northern Zhungar Basin. According to him, this does not include the central platform area of the Zhungar Basin, which is currently being explored.
    Now, large-scale drilling work is constantly extending to the vast Gobi Desert. In an area of several hundred square kilometers, tall derricks, clusters of white tents, and the dust brought up by the shuttling transport vehicles can be seen everywhere. Tens of thousands of petroleum workers are selflessly working to uncover the secrets of this oil field.

### 地下油海—克拉玛依

    地下油海—克拉玛依
    新华社记者　韩文慧
    到克拉玛依的客人都要跑到沥青山上去看看。在强烈的太阳下面，人们踏上这座由沥青堆积起来的山丘的时候，就会感到像走在地毯上面一样，脚下软绵绵的。在这座山丘的山坡上，可以看到胶状的沥青从山丘裂缝里向外挤。山顶上有两个油泉，突突的冒出黑褐色的原油。过去在这里收集原油和挖掘沥青的维吾尔族人，把它叫作“克拉玛依”。“克拉玛依”就是“黑油”的意思。
    原油冒出地面来，从地质观点上看，可能是地下储油构造经过造山运动破坏之后出现的一种现象。就是根据这种估计，所以过去有人认为这里的油田已经没有工业价值了。
    去年七月，新疆石油管理局派来了一支青年突击钻井队在这里开钻了第一口探井。这口探井钻到目的层以后，井底原油就像一股喷泉，从油管呼啸而出。青年突击队员们高兴得挥舞着帽子在井台上欢呼。他们围坐在篝火旁边谈论着克拉玛依的未来远景，一直到天亮。
    青年工人们向往的远景没有落空。接着第一口探井出油以后，陆续开钻的第二口、第三口、第四口……，许多探井都钻出了原油；出油量也一口井多于一口井。今年上半年是决定克拉玛依油田有没有工业含油价值的关头。克拉玛依在这个时期在它的历史上留下了光辉的记载。振奋人心的消息一个接一个，庆祝这口探井出油的锣鼓余音未息，庆祝另一口探井出油的锣鼓声又响了。贺信、贺电纷纷寄到这里来。克拉玛依沉浸在从来未有的欢乐气氛里。
    现在，克拉玛依已经钻完的二十多口探井都钻出了原油和油气；有十五口探井已经自喷出原油。这些事实证明了克拉玛依油田不但没有被破坏，而且是一个储量丰富、面积很大的油田。
    从今年下半年起，克拉玛依油区钻井工作开始迈开大步来钻探油田的边界了。最先迈出十公里以外为侦察油田边界而开钻的一口探井，已经出现了很好的油砂和油气。这口探井经过地质人员的鉴定，断定井下油层和已经出油的地区的油层完全一样。原来已经被确定为油田边界并且准备建筑房屋的地区，最近在打一口供应工程用水的水井时，又钻出了原油。弄得有关部门不得不重新考虑房屋的建筑位置。
    在克拉玛依东北一百多公里的乌尔禾，地质探勘人员过去在普查和详测的时候，就曾经发现了很好的构造和露头沥青。他们从获得的资料判断，乌尔禾不仅含油的希望很大，而且很可能和克拉玛依连接起来。新疆石油管理局已经把这两个地方的名称连在一起，叫做“克拉玛依—乌尔禾油区”。记者最近在乌尔禾访问时，参观了地质专家十分感兴趣的沥青脉。这条沥青脉长达四十公里，从岩石裂缝里挤出来的原油经过氧化后已经变成固体沥青了。地质专家们认为这种凝固后的沥青，已把地下储油构造封闭起来；构造并未受到破坏。今年在乌尔禾进行构造浅钻的勘探队已经在好几处钻出原油和油砂。现在在乌尔禾风景优美的艾里克湖畔，已经竖起了一座座探井的井架。这些探井将进一步证实这个地区的储油情况。
    在克拉玛依和乌尔禾之间的地带也发现了油。记者路过这里的时候，看到公路旁一个沙坑里聚着半坑原油，漫流在沙滩上的原油已经变成固体。据说浅钻队在这里钻完构造浅钻撤走以后，原油就从钻孔里流出来，人们发觉后才塞住了钻孔。这些景象使人感到这里像一个油海，遍地都埋藏着石油。乌尔禾和克拉玛依连结起来的说法看起来是有根据的。
    克拉玛依油田到底有多大，边界在哪里？现在还是深远莫测的。住在克拉玛依的作家、记者们最近邀请这里的地质工程师介绍了油田的远景。这位工程师在谈到这个油区可能的含油面积时，他的手掌从准噶尔盆地地形图的西北角一直移到东北角，然后又在图上用手指划了一个大圈。他这一圈几乎把准噶尔盆地北部全部圈了进去。据他说，这还没有包括正在勘探的准噶尔盆地中央地台区。
    现在，大规模的钻探工作正向辽阔的戈壁上不断延伸。在几百平方公里的面积上，到处可以看见高耸的井架，一簇簇的白色帐篷和往来如梭的运输汽车所带起来的漫天沙尘。成千上万的石油工人正为揭开这个油田的秘密进行着忘我的劳动。
