Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 3rd: The "Nation" newspaper published a report on July 31st from an unspecified source, saying: "Several hundred fully armed Communist Chinese troops have invaded and occupied Burmese territory near the border from Putao to Kanlang Ferry, a distance of 500 miles, and are still moving inland."

The newspaper said that Prime Minister U Ba Swe convened a meeting of the cabinet's "inner circle" and the heads of the armed forces yesterday to discuss this serious situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 3rd: The Burmese government issued a statement on July 31st, the full text of which is as follows:

"Regarding the news published by the 'Nation' on July 31, 1956, under the headline 'Red Chinese Soldiers Cross Burmese Border,' the Government of the Union of Burma wishes to issue the following statement:

"The Government of the Union of Burma maintains close contact with developments on the Burma-China border. The 'Nation's' claim that Chinese troops have occupied Magungham, Nawbum, and two other villages between Hpimaw and Sataung is untrue. Two of these places are currently garrisoned by the Federal Armed Forces, which maintain radio contact with the relevant headquarters; the other places are under surveillance. The claim that the Prime Minister convened the cabinet's 'inner circle' and the heads of the armed forces yesterday to discuss this situation is also untrue.

"The actual situation is that some Chinese troops have entered Burmese territory and established outposts in Wa State, on Union land very close to the Burma-China border. The Federal Government has brought this matter to the attention of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and negotiations are now underway to have these Chinese troops withdraw to the Chinese side of the border. Although the Government of the Union of Burma cannot but be seriously concerned about this situation, it should be emphasized that the situation has not reached the point where it needs to be dealt with in the manner suggested by the 'Nation.'"

    仰光“民族报”散布我军“侵入”缅甸的谣言
    缅甸政府就此发表声明
    新华社仰光3日电　“民族报”七月三十一日发表一项没有说明来源的消息说：“几百名全副武装的共产党中国军队已经侵入并且占领了从葡萄城到肯朗渡口共长五百英里的边界附近的缅甸领土，而且仍然在向内地移动中。”
    这家报纸说：吴巴瑞总理昨天召集了内阁“内圈”和各军种首脑会谈，讨论这种严重局势。
    新华社仰光3日电　缅甸政府七月三十一日发表了一项声明，全文如下：
    “关于1956年7月31日的‘民族报’在‘红色中国士兵越过缅甸边界’的标题下发表的消息，缅甸联邦政府希望发表以下的声明。
    “对于缅甸—中国边境的事态，缅甸联邦政府保持着密切的联系。‘民族报’所说中国军队已经占领马滚甘、娜汶和辟毛到萨通之间的其他两个村庄，这是不真实的。这些地方中有两个地方目前由联邦武装部队驻扎，同有关总部保持着无线电的联系；其他的地方处在监视之下。关于总理在昨天召集内阁的‘内圈’和各军种首脑会商这种局势的说法，也是不真实的。
    “实际的情况是：有些中国部队进入了缅甸领土，在瓦邦非常接近缅甸—中国边境的联邦土地上建立了哨岗。联邦政府已经提请中华人民共和国政府注意这件事情，现在正在进行谈判，以使这些中国部队撤退到边境的中国方面去。虽然缅甸联邦政府对这种事态不能不严重地关切，但是应当着重说明：情况并没有达到需要像‘民族报’所说的那样去对待的地步。”
