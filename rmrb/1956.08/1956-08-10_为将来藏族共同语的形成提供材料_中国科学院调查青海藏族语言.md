Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 8th. Four staff members from the Qinghai Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Investigation Team left Xining yesterday for the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Personnel going to the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture departed from Xining on the 1st and 3rd respectively.

Tibetan has many dialects. This time, the investigation team will go deep into the Tibetan masses in pastoral and agricultural areas to understand the differences between various dialects by recording pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, and roughly delineate their distribution, in order to provide preliminary materials for the future formation of a common Tibetan language. The investigation team will work in Qinghai for approximately one year, gradually covering all Tibetan areas in Qinghai Province in addition to the aforementioned three regions.

Of the twelve members of the investigation team, seven are Tibetan and five are Han. After arriving in Xining from Beijing at the end of last month, they held discussions with relevant personnel from the Qinghai Provincial Nationalities Affairs Commission and Sangre Gyatso (Tibetan), the director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education, and others. They introduced the situation in the Tibetan areas of Qinghai to the investigation team and expressed their welcome and support for the Tibetan language investigation work.

    为将来藏族共同语的形成提供材料
    中国科学院调查青海藏族语言
    新华社西宁8日电　中国科学院少数民族语言调查队青海组中的四个工作人员昨天离开西宁赴海南藏族自治州。到玉树藏族自治州、海北藏族自治州去调查的人员已在一日和三日从西宁出发。
    藏语方言很多，调查组这次要深入到牧业区和农业区的藏民群众中去，通过记录语音、词汇、语法，了解各种方言的差异和大致上划清它们的分布情况，为将来藏语共同语的形成提供初步材料。调查组将在青海工作大约一年，除上述三个地区外还要逐渐走遍青海省所有的藏族地区。
    调查组的十二个成员中，七人是藏族，五人是汉族。上月底他们从北京到达西宁后，曾和青海省民族事务委员会有关人员、青海省教育厅长桑热嘉措（藏族）等座谈过。他们向调查组介绍了青海藏族地区的情况，并且表示欢迎和支持藏语调查工作。
