    Half of Yangtze River Bridge Technicians Promoted
    (Xinhua News Agency) According to the recent skill assessment results from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau: Approximately 50% of the over two thousand eight hundred formal technical workers on the entire construction site have been promoted; some have even been promoted by two grades.
    The apprentices who built the Han River Railway Bridge three years ago have now almost all become excellent masters on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site; and many of the master craftsmen of that time have now become foremen, leading workers, and some have become team leaders. During this period, the number of technical workers has more than doubled. Initially, there was only one and a half bridge engineering teams here, but now it has developed into three bridge engineering teams with relatively complete types of work.
    The leadership of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site has taken the following measures to help workers improve their technical skills: one is to run short-term training classes to teach ordinary workers and apprentices basic knowledge of specialized technical theory, and then assign them to the site, where master craftsmen lead them to learn while doing; the other is to mobilize workers on the construction site to sign master-apprentice contracts, guaranteeing teaching and learning. These methods have had significant effects on improving the technical level of workers.

    长江大桥半数技工升级
    据新华社讯　根据武汉长江大桥工程局最近考工评级结果：全工地两千八百多个正式技术工人当中，约有50％左右升了级；其中有的升了两级。
    三年前建筑汉水铁桥的学徒工，现在差不多都成了武汉长江大桥工地上的出色的师傅；而那时的许多老师傅，现在都成了工长、领工员，有的成了队长。在这期间，技术工人的数量已经增加了一倍以上。最初这里只有一个半桥梁工程队，现在已经发展成三个工种较为齐全的桥梁工程队。
    武汉长江大桥工地领导方面曾经采取了以下一些办法帮助工人提高技术水平：一是开办短期训练班，对普通工、学徒工授以专门技术理论基本知识，然后分配到现场，由老师傅带领边做边学；一是在工地上发动工人们订立师徒合同，包教包学。这些办法对提高工人的技术水平都有显著的成效。
