    Lhasa Impressions (Part 2)
    Lin Gang

    Unity and Progress

    In Lhasa, you can meet Han workers, technicians, and cadres from Sichuan, Qinghai, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, speaking in their various accents. Outstanding individuals from all over the country have been sent to support the construction of the border region. Life on the plateau is quite arduous, but the staff working in Tibet are in high spirits. Their slogan is "Build Tibet for the Long Term." Everyone is diligently studying their respective fields. Doctors at the People's Hospital are researching common diseases on the plateau, and bank cadres are studying how to improve the work of issuing agricultural loans. Not long ago, many advanced workers from Tibet went to Beijing to attend the conference of advanced workers. Lhasa's cadres grow their own vegetables in their spare time to improve their meals, participate in voluntary labor to repair squares, build houses, and plant trees to green Lhasa. The attire of both male and female comrades here is more stylish than that of cadres in inland cities, which also reflects their mood. A young man who came to Tibet with the army told me, "I am proud that I have dedicated my youth, the most precious time of my life, to the cause of socialist construction on the plateau."

    Lhasa time is two hours behind Beijing time. The sun sets very late in the evening, but it still gets bright very early in the morning, effectively lengthening the daytime. People who cherish time say they love Lhasa because there is more time to study here.

    In order to help the Tibetan people build a new life for the long term, all the cadres working in Tibet are learning Tibetan. Each agency in Lhasa has eight hours of Tibetan language study time per week. Comrade Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, has a Tibetan literacy board in his office, which is changed daily. A Tibetan cadre from the Working Committee is his teacher. Tibetan is a phonetic language, simpler and easier to learn than Chinese, so there are many who have achieved excellent results in their studies. Primary school teachers use Tibetan to teach, and doctors can speak to patients in Tibetan. However, in my opinion, Tibetan cadres are even better at learning Mandarin, and comrades working in Tibet should speed up their progress.

    The relationship between the staff working in Tibet and the Tibetan people is very close. As the Tibetan people like to say, "We are united like milk and water." If there was some politeness and formality between each other when they first arrived in Tibet due to the long-standing ethnic estrangement formed by history, then this unity is now built on the basis of criticism and self-criticism. We see how familiar, affectionate, sincere, and frank the responsible comrades of the CPC Tibet Working Committee are with Tibetan officials. Counting from Princess Wencheng, the Tibetan and Han nationalities have had 1,300 years of friendly relations. But only today do these two brotherly nationalities truly treat each other as equals.

    Tibet is still a society with a strict class system. People of different classes can be distinguished by their clothing. In the past, nobles thought about acquiring more manors for their children, and mothers worried about preparing a decent dowry for their daughters early on, buying more "Bazhu" (a kind of headdress). Now, parents are vying to send their children to Beijing to study. The changes brought to Lhasa by peaceful liberation are subtly reflected in people's thoughts, lives, and other aspects. According to centuries-old customs, nobles had to be transported by carriages and horses when they went out, with "Wazi" (servants) heralding and following them. Now, officials like So Kong Kalon do not think it is beneath their dignity to walk.

    Today's Tibetan nobles are different from those before liberation, and they are progressing. Some people who once had illusions about imperialism before liberation are now proud to be citizens of an independent and strong New China. After arriving in Lhasa, I understood the great significance of the central government's annual organization of people from all walks of life in Tibet to visit various parts of the motherland. The new socialist life inspires the Tibetan people to catch up. At the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, all monks, officials, nobles, and lamas expressed their support for the implementation of reforms in Tibet. The nobility's support for reform means that they agree to abolish the feudal land system, abolish Ula (unpaid corvée labor), and liberate serfs; and that farmers and herdsmen will obtain land and pastures and embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. I once visited former Kalon Kashupa and asked him why the Tibetan nobles supported the reforms. He said: "First, we support the Communist Party's method of implementing reforms from top to bottom through peaceful consultation; second, I visited Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other places, and I saw with my own eyes that after the reforms, the farmers and herdsmen lived better, and the leaders lived even better than before. Moreover, they all have work to do and have the opportunity to serve the people." The lamas in Lhasa are also praying for the early realization of socialism in the motherland. They believe that only with political development can religion develop, and only socialism can make religion prosperous.

     Lhasa is Under Construction

    Students at Lhasa Elementary School love to paint the Potala Palace. In the paintings, there are newly built roads in front of the Potala Palace, with large trucks speeding on the roads; airplanes are circling in the sky, scattering colorful leaflets. The teacher told me that two years ago, students painted yaks in front of the Potala Palace. Children's observation skills are sharp; the city they live in is changing every day.

    A new city is growing up next to the old city – this is a common feature of the urban landscape in our country during the transition period. Lhasa is also like this. Several wide, straight roads are extending to the suburbs. Old books say that the Potala Palace is in the suburbs, but now it should be said that it is in the city. New buildings appear amidst the green trees: the Military Region Command, the Lhasa Auditorium, the Meteorological Station..., after living in tents for several years after the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the soldiers have now moved into beautiful barracks. Members of the Central Delegation stayed in the Reception Building this time, and comrades from Beijing affectionately called this newly completed building "the Beijing Hotel of Lhasa" because it is not only impressive in appearance, but also exquisite, clean, and comfortable in the layout of the rooms. In Zhongjilin, there is a piece of white house, that is the base camp for cultivating Tibetan cadres -- Tibet Cadre School. East of the mosque, there used to be only a handful of households, but now it has the scale of a street. In recent years, nobles have also built many new houses in the Linka.

    The old building scaffolds have not yet been dismantled, and the new ones have already been erected. In the next two years, new buildings will be built, including the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee Building, the CPC Tibet Working Committee Office Building, the Workers' Cultural Palace, the Youth Federation Club... From morning to dusk, groups of yaks and donkeys continuously carry stones, bricks, lime, and sand to the construction site. The main building material – wood – is also being transported from the Taizhao Forest Area, 300 kilometers away, to Lhasa in a steady stream. A socialist labor competition is underway at the construction site. The hardworking and intelligent Tibetan working people built such magnificent palaces as the Potala Palace 1,300 years ago, and now their descendants are going to build many modern factories in their hometown.

    Before liberation, Lhasa had no modern industry at all, and now it is being built from scratch. A serum manufacturing plant has been established on the parade ground in the Qing Dynasty. The main product of this factory, "sheep-passaged, rabbit-passaged cattle plague virus," has been successfully trial-produced and is starting mass production. For centuries, when livestock were infected with plague, Tibetans had to watch their cattle and sheep die in droves. Now they can turn to science for help.

    Don't dislike the dim lights in Lhasa. A new hydropower station is being built in the Duodi Gully, 7 kilometers from the city, which will generate electricity using the torrents flowing down from the mountains, with a total power generation ten times that of the current one. This power plant was designed by Chinese experts, and all the equipment is made in China. In order to meet the needs of highway transportation development, the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory has also started construction. Since the opening of the highway, workers have been using the original old machines to cope with the repair situation. After the new factory is completed, it can overhaul 20 large vehicles at the same time, and medium and small repairs for 15 vehicles. I met the Tibetan female turner Cai Deng Zhuma next to a British-made Lion lathe produced 30 years ago. A Han worker used these broken machines to teach her the complete set of skills. She is 22 years old this year and looks humble and confident. This Tibetan girl is very happy that after the factory is completed in October, she will be working on the latest Chinese-made lathes.

    The garden of the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station was donated by the Dalai Lama. A group of agricultural scientists sent by the State Council are carrying out huge experimental work here. Many crops, vegetables, and fruits that have never been planted in the Tibetan plateau before have appeared – winter wheat, corn, millet, panicled millet, rye, alfalfa, tomatoes, watermelons... In the past three years, they have introduced more than 500 new varieties from the mainland, more than half of which have achieved high yields. This is construction on the agricultural front. Their creative work and remarkable achievements have aroused domestic and foreign interest. People will not find the following numbers boring: the excellent varieties of winter wheat planted on the Tibetan plateau at an altitude of three or four thousand meters can yield 800 catties per mu, and potatoes can yield more than 6,000 catties per mu; watermelon is a tropical crop, in order to increase cold resistance, watermelon seedlings are grafted onto pumpkin stems, and a watermelon grows to thirty catties; tomatoes bred with new methods weigh one catty and fourteen taels each. Onions are two and a half catties each, and one radish weighs twenty-eight catties. For the first time on the plateau, there are fresh Jiangnan cucumbers, Heilongjiang's "Keshuang" soybeans, Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, Lanzhou pickled melon, Northwest cauliflower, Soviet flax, and Albanian spinach. Last year, the nursery of the experiment station planted subtropical fruit tree seeds for the first time. The director said, "Please come here in two years to eat our own fresh fruits." The growing season for plateau vegetables is very short. Agronomists say, "We want the Tibetan people to eat vegetables all year round." The work of the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station has proved that the Tibetan plateau has fertile soil, can grow all kinds of crops, and can achieve high yields. Now, the problem they are going to solve is to promote these successfully tested new varieties on a large scale throughout Tibet.

    Of course, when it comes to construction, the greatest achievements are in the transportation industry. In the past, it took at least a year and a half for people from the mainland to go to Tibet. This time, we took a car from Xining to Lhasa via the newly built Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which only took ten days. Cadres who rode horses over the mountains and ridges to enter Tibet in the past envied us for our good fortune, praising the highway for shortening the distance between Beijing and Lhasa. Little did they know that when we came back, the test flight of the "air forbidden zone" had been successful. We were the first passengers on the test flight, and it only took three hours to fly from Lhasa to Xining. This is the speed of building socialism on the plateau. When we were in Tibet, we heard that the railway could be built to Tibet around 1960. After the railway is opened, it will be as convenient to take a train from Beijing to Lhasa as it is to go to Shanghai. People's concepts should change: Lhasa is not far away. (Attached picture)

    拉萨见闻（下）
    林钢
    团结和进步
    在拉萨，你可以遇见操着四川、青海、北京、上海等地口音的汉族工人、技术人员和机关干部。全国各地都派遣了优秀分子来支援边疆建设。高原生活相当艰苦，但是进藏工作人员的情绪都很饱满。他们的口号是“长期建藏”。大家都在各自的岗位上钻研业务。人民医院的大夫在研究高原上的多发病，银行干部研究的是怎样做好发放农业贷款的工作。不久以前，西藏有许多先进工作者到北京参加先进工作者会议。拉萨的机关干部在工作之余还自己种蔬菜改善伙食，参加义务劳动修广场，建造房屋，植树绿化拉萨。这里男女同志的穿戴比起内地城市的干部来都要漂亮，也可以概见他们的心情。一位随军进藏的青年对我说：“我很骄傲，我把自己的青春，我的生命中最宝贵的时刻，献给了高原上的社会主义建设事业。”
    拉萨的时间，同北京相差二小时。晚上太阳落山很迟，但早晨却亮得仍然很早，白昼无形中增长了。珍惜时间的人说，他们爱拉萨是因为这里有更多的学习时间。
    为了长期帮助藏族人民建设新生活，全体进藏干部都在学习藏文。拉萨各机关每周都有八小时藏文学习时间。中共西藏工委副书记范明同志的办公室里有一块藏文识字牌，每天一换。工委一位藏族干部是他的教师。藏文是拼音文字，比汉文简单，易学，所以学习成绩优异的大有人在。小学教员用藏语教学，大夫可以用藏语同病人讲话。不过照我看来，藏族干部学汉话的成绩更要好，值得进藏工作的同志们快马加鞭。
    进藏工作人员同藏族人民的关系很亲密。用藏胞爱说的话：“我们团结得像牛奶和水一样”。如果说，由于历史上形成的长期的民族隔阂，刚刚进藏的时候，彼此之间不免还有点客客气气的话，那么现在这种团结已经建立在批评和自我批评的基础上了。我们看到，中共西藏工委的负责同志和西藏官员之间，是多么熟悉，亲热，又是多么诚恳，坦率。从文成公主算起，藏汉两个民族已经有了一千三百年的友谊联系。但是，只是到了今天，这两个兄弟民族才是真正的平等相处。
    西藏目前还是一个阶级森严的社会。不同阶级的人，从服饰就可以区别出来。从前贵族们为子女想的，是多置几处庄园，母亲操心的是早早替闺女准备好一份体面的嫁妆，多买几副“巴肘”（一种头饰）。现在做父母的都争着要把儿女送到北京去学习。和平解放给拉萨带来的变化，细微地表现在人的思想、生活等各个方面。几百年来的规矩，贵族出门必须有车马代步，有“娃子”前呼后拥。现在，像索康噶伦那样职位的官员，也并不认为自己走路是有失身份的事儿了。
    今天西藏的贵族已不同于解放前的贵族，他们正在进步。有些在解放以前对帝国主义曾经存在幻想的人，现在都以自己是一个独立的、强大的新中国的公民而骄傲。到了拉萨，我才懂得了中央每年组织西藏各阶层人民到祖国各地参观的巨大意义。社会主义建设的新生活，鼓舞着藏族人民要迎头赶上。这一次在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上，全体僧俗官员、贵族和喇嘛，都表示拥护在西藏实行改革。贵族拥护改革，这就是说，他们同意废除封建的土地制度，废除乌拉（无偿劳役），解放农奴；而农民和牧民将要得到土地和牧场，将要走互助合作的道路。我曾经访问前任噶伦噶须巴，问他为什么西藏的贵族都拥护改革。他说：“第一，我们拥护共产党用自上而下、和平协商的办法来实行改革；第二，我在内蒙古、新疆等地参观，亲眼看到，改革以后，农民和牧民固然生活得好了，头人生活也都比原来的过得更好了。而且都有工作可做，有机会为人民服务。”拉萨的喇嘛也都在为祖国早日实现社会主义而祈祷。他们相信，只有政治发展了，宗教才能得到发展，只有社会主义才能使宗教昌盛。
     拉萨在建设中
    拉萨小学的学生爱画布达拉宫。画面上，布达拉宫前面有新修的公路，大卡车在公路上飞驶；天空里有飞机在盘旋，撒下来一片彩色的传单。老师告诉我，二年前，学生们在布达拉宫面前画的是牦牛。孩子的观察力是敏锐的，他们生活着的城市每天都在变化。
    一个新的城市在旧城身边成长起来——这是过渡时期我国城市面貌的共同特征。拉萨也是这样。好几条宽阔、笔直的马路在向市郊伸展出去。旧的书本上都说，布达拉宫在市郊，现在应当说在市内了。绿树掩映中出现了一幢幢新的建筑物：军区司令部、拉萨大礼堂、气象站……，解放军进城后，过了几年帐篷生活，现在战士们搬进了漂亮的营房。中央代表团团员这次住在交际处大楼，北京来的同志亲昵地把这一幢新落成的建筑称作“拉萨的北京饭店”，因为它不仅外观很有气派，房间的布置也精致、洁净、舒适。仲机林卡里有一片白色的房屋，那是培养藏族干部的大本营——西藏干部学校。清真寺往东去原来只有寥寥可数的几户人家，现在已经具有街道的规模了。这几年来，贵族在林卡里也新盖了不少房屋。
    旧的建筑架还没有拆除，新的又已经支架起来了。今明两年要新建的，还有西藏自治区筹委会大楼，中共西藏工委办公楼，工人文化宫，青妇联俱乐部……。从清晨到黄昏，成群的牦牛和毛驴，络绎不断地驮运着石块、砖、石灰、沙土来到工地。主要的建筑材料——木材，也正在从三百公里外的太昭森林区，源源运向拉萨。工地上正在展开社会主义劳动竞赛。勤劳智慧的藏族劳动人民在一千三百年前就建造了像布达拉宫这样雄伟的宫殿，现在他们的子孙要在自己的家乡建设起许多现代化的工厂。
    解放以前拉萨根本没有现代化的工业，现在是要从无到有的建设起来。在清朝时代的阅兵场上，已经建立起了一座血清制造厂。这座工厂的主要产品“绵羊化、兔化牛瘟病毒”已经试制成功，开始大批生产。多少世纪以来，当牲口传染了瘟疫，藏民只得眼巴巴的看着牛羊成群死亡。现在他们可以求助于科学了。
    你不要嫌拉萨的电灯不亮，一座新的水力发电站已在离市区七公里外的夺地沟山谷里修建起来，它将依靠山上泻下来的湍流发电，发电总量等于现在的十倍。这个电厂是由中国专家设计的，全套设备都是国产品。为了适应公路运输发展的需要，拉萨汽车修配厂也已经动工兴建。公路通车以来，工人一直利用原有的旧机器来应付修配局面的。新的工厂建成以后，可以同时大修二十辆大型汽车，中修、小修十五辆。我在一台三十年前出品的英国货Lion牌车床旁边遇见了藏族女车工彩登珠玛。一位汉族工人就是利用这些破机器传授给了她全套本领的。她今年二十二岁，看来谦虚而有自信。这位藏族姑娘非常高兴，十月间工厂完工以后，她将要在我国自己制造的最新式的车床上面工作。
    拉萨农业试验场的园地是达赖喇嘛送给的。国务院派来的一批农业科学工作者在这里进行巨大的试验工作。西藏高原上出现了许多过去从来没有种植过的农作物、蔬菜和果木——冬小麦、玉米、谷子、糜子、黑麦、苜蓿、番茄、西瓜……。三年来他们先后从内地引进了五百多种新的品种，半数以上获得了高额产量。这是农业战线上的建设。他们的创造性的劳动和显著的成绩已经引起了国内外的兴趣。下面这些数字人们一定不会感到枯燥：在海拔三、四千公尺的西藏高原上栽种的优良品种的冬小麦，每亩能收八百斤，马铃薯每亩收六千多斤；西瓜是热带作物，为了增加抗寒能力，把西瓜苗嫁接在南瓜茎上，一个西瓜长了三十斤；用新法育种的番茄，一个就有一斤十四两重。洋葱二斤半一根，一个萝葡重二十八斤。高原上第一次出现了鲜嫩的江南黄瓜、黑龙江省的“克霜”黄豆、四川榨菜、兰州醉瓜、西北花椰菜、苏联亚麻、阿尔巴尼亚的菠菜。去年试验场的苗圃里第一次种了亚热带的果树种子，场长说，再过两年请到这里来吃我们自己栽的新鲜水果。高原蔬菜的生长季节很短，农学家说，我们要让西藏人民一年四季都吃到蔬菜。拉萨农业试验场的工作已经证明了：西藏高原土地肥沃，可以种各种庄稼，而且可以获得高额丰收。现在他们将要着手解决的问题是，把这些试验成功的新品种在全藏大面积推广。
    自然，谈到建设，成绩最大的还是交通事业。从前内地人到西藏去，少不得需时一年半载。这次我们从西宁坐汽车经新修的青藏公路到拉萨，只走了十天。前几年骑着马翻山越岭进藏的干部羡慕我们好福气，称赞公路缩短了北京拉萨之间的距离。殊不知回来的时候，“空中禁区”的试航已经成功，我们做了试航飞机的第一批乘客，从拉萨到西宁只飞了三小时。这就是高原上建设社会主义的速度。我们在西藏时听说，铁路在1960年左右就可以修到西藏，铁路修通以后，从北京坐火车到拉萨，就像到上海一样的方便。人们的观念应当转变了：拉萨并不远。（附图片）
