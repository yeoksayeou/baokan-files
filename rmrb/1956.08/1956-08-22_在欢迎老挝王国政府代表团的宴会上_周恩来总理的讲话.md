Speech by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Banquet Welcoming the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos

Your Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, distinguished guests of the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, ladies and gentlemen:

Today, we are here to warmly welcome the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, who have come to visit our country. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, to express our highest respect to His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister, and to all friends of the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, and through you, to the people of Laos.

The Chinese people highly cherish the long-standing and profound friendship between the Chinese and Lao people. China and Laos have always been neighbors living in harmony. Friendly exchanges between our two peoples began more than a thousand years ago. We have both experienced the pain of colonial oppression. It was only through arduous struggles that both of our countries recently regained national sovereignty and freedom. Now, the people of both our countries equally hope to build our own countries in a peaceful environment. Therefore, the Chinese and Lao people can easily understand each other, and sympathize with and care for each other.

During the Geneva Conference in 1954, the Chinese Government delegation and the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos had friendly contacts and made efforts to promote the restoration of peace in Indochina. During the Bandung Conference in 1955, the Chinese Government delegation and the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos had further friendly contacts and contributed to the historic success of the conference and the friendly unity of Asian and African countries. These friendly contacts laid the foundation for the restoration and development of friendly relations between China and Laos. Today, we are particularly pleased and happy to receive the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, in our capital, Beijing.

We are very pleased to see that not long ago, the talks between His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, and His Highness Prince Souphanouvong, head of the Lao Fighting Units Delegation, have reached a unanimous agreement and good results. In the joint communiqué, both sides announced that Laos supports a policy of peace and neutrality, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and establishes friendly relations with all countries, especially with its neighbors. The joint communiqué also announced that Laos will not join any military alliance and, except as provided for in the Geneva Agreements, will not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on Lao territory. These agreements will undoubtedly contribute to consolidating the peace and independence of Laos and realizing the democracy, unity, prosperity and strength of Laos, and are also fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Agreements and the Bandung Conference. We believe that the policy of peace and neutrality of the Kingdom of Laos will surely win the sympathy and support of Asian, African and world peace-loving countries and people, and will also make a valuable contribution to promoting the realization of the Geneva Agreements and the Bandung spirit in the Indochinese countries.

The Chinese government and people fully respect the policy of peace and neutrality announced by Laos. We also welcome and thank the friendly expressions from the Kingdom of Laos. We fully agree with the good evaluation of the relations between China and Laos by His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos. Indeed, as His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma has pointed out, there are no disputes between our two countries, and we have been living peacefully side by side on either side of a common border. We are deeply convinced that this visit to our country by the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, will further promote the development of friendly relations between our two countries. China will unswervingly be a good friend and good neighbor of Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, just as we are willing to be good friends and good neighbors with all neighboring countries. We will work with Laos to strengthen friendly cooperation between our two countries in all aspects.

I propose that everyone raise their glasses, for the increasing development of friendly relations between China and Laos, for the unity of the Asian and African people and the victory of the Bandung spirit, for world peace, for the prosperity of the Kingdom of Laos, and for the health of His Majesty King Sisavang Vong of Laos, cheers!

Speech by Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma

Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!

First of all, I should express our sincere gratitude to you on behalf of the Lao delegation and in my personal name.

Since we set foot on Chinese soil, we have been constantly receiving warm welcomes and friendly expressions, which have deeply moved us.

This reception makes us happy, but we are not surprised.

In fact, we are restoring old friendly relations that were temporarily interrupted by historical changes. This friendly relationship should be the criterion for the relationship between two neighboring countries. After a long period of interruption and severe turmoil in the relations between the two countries, it is reasonable for China and Laos to restore relations.

We are very concerned and closely watching your great efforts to build your society on a new basis and to promote your economic prosperity while respecting your national independence. We are very happy to be able to admire in the coming days the wonderful achievements you have already made in all aspects under the promotion of wise and strong leaders.

Compared with China, Laos is indeed a small country. We can hardly compare with your country. However, Laos has its own problems and its independent status. If you allow me to spend some time talking to you, I think it would be beneficial.

Laos has a long history. Since the Lao and Thai people from southern China settled in the native land of the original indigenous people, the nation of these people was born on the cultural and political foundation of Indian civilization. Therefore, our country originated from both China and India, which I am happy to particularly point out.

Laos has been reorganized as a constitutional monarchy since 1947. Our independence has been recognized. Domestic construction work in politics, society, and economy has been difficult to carry out due to the state of war. The Geneva Agreement ended this state of war.

Since this period, the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the Geneva Agreement have been resolved, because the Kingdom Government and some Lao people have just reached an agreement. This long-awaited state of national unity and reconciliation enables the Kingdom to engage more effectively in the peaceful construction of the country.

Laos is a small country on the mainland, surrounded by powerful neighbors. Laos is also a country with Buddhist traditions, and therefore a peace-loving country. It cannot be said that it poses a threat to its neighbors. The pain suffered not long ago due to the war, as well as its historical encounters, make our kingdom very sensitive to all acts that may constitute external interference.

Laos can only hope for the goodwill and sincerity of its surrounding neighbors to continue to survive peacefully. We know that among such neighbors, we can count on China.

In our foreign relations, we first consider the obligations we voluntarily assumed in Geneva. According to this obligation, as long as our security is not disturbed, we will not participate in any military alliance. At the same time, except as stipulated in the Geneva Agreement, we will not allow any foreign bases to be established on our territory. On the other hand, Laos accepts the five principles established by Nehru, especially those stipulated in the Sino-Indian Agreement of 1954. These five principles, which originate from Buddhist precepts and are closely related to the principles of the Asian-African Conference, are a moral obligation for us and give us confidence in our friendly countries. We believe that if these principles can be sincerely accepted and implemented, then the relations between countries will become more harmonious.

Therefore, our policy is mainly a neutral policy. Laos does not participate in any great power bloc. We are willing to live in peace with all our neighbors and concentrate on national construction issues.

The reason why I have talked more about these issues is because we earnestly hope that our position, even if it cannot gain sympathy, can be understood. We believe that the differences between the systems of China and Laos should not become an obstacle to understanding and friendship. For our part, we will respect the system of the People's Republic of China.

I hope that the visit of the Lao delegation will create a friendly atmosphere between our two countries and make some contribution to the easing of the world situation we have recently seen. We hope that this easing of the world situation will be universal and comprehensive, because this is a necessary condition for realizing the peace we sincerely desire.

With this hope, I propose a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and to the prosperity of the Chinese people.

    在欢迎老挝王国政府代表团的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的首相梭发那·富马亲王殿下和老挝王国政府代表团的各位贵宾，女士们，先生们：
    今天，我们在这里热烈地欢迎以梭发那·富马亲王殿下为首的前来我国访问的老挝王国政府代表团。我愿意趁此机会，代表中国政府和中国人民，对首相梭发那·富马亲王殿下和老挝王国政府代表团的全体朋友们，并通过你们向老挝全国人民表示崇高的敬意。
    中国人民十分珍视自己同老挝人民之间的悠久而深厚的友谊。中国和老挝一向就是和睦相处的邻居。我们两国人民早在一千多年以前就开始了友好的来往。我们曾经共同经历过殖民主义压迫的痛苦。我们两国都只是经过艰苦的斗争，才在不久前恢复了国家的主权和自由。现在，我们两国人民又同样地希望能够在和平的环境中建设自己的国家。因此，中国人民和老挝人民是容易彼此了解的，而且是互相同情、互相关怀的。
    1954年在日内瓦会议期间，中国政府代表团和老挝王国政府代表团曾经有过友好的接触，并且都为促成印度支那和平的恢复作了努力。1955年在万隆会议期间，中国政府代表团和老挝王国政府代表团又有了进一步的友好接触，并且对于会议的历史性的成功和亚非国家的友好团结作出了贡献。这些友好接触为恢复和发展中老两国之间的友好关系奠立了基础。今天我们能够在我国的首都北京接待以梭发那·富马亲王殿下为首的老挝王国政府代表团，我们感到格外的愉快和高兴。
    我们十分欣慰地看到，不久以前，老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王殿下和寮国战斗部队代表团苏发努冯亲王殿下的会谈已经获得了一致的协议和良好的结果。双方在联合公报中曾经宣布：老挝赞成和平中立政策，奉行和平共处的五项原则，同各国，特别是同各邻国建立友好的关系。联合公报并且宣布，老挝将不加入任何军事同盟，而且除了日内瓦协议所规定的情况外，不允许在老挝领土上建立外国的军事基地。这些协议无疑地有利于巩固老挝的和平和独立和实现老挝的民主，统一和富强，而且也完全符合日内瓦协议和万隆会议的精神。我们相信，老挝王国的和平中立政策一定会赢得亚非和世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持，并且对于促进日内瓦协议和万隆精神在印度支那各国的实现，也将会作出有价值的贡献。
    中国政府和人民十分尊重老挝所宣布的和平中立政策。我们也欢迎和感谢来自老挝王国方面的友好表示。我们完全同意老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王殿下对中国同老挝的关系的良好评价。的确，正如梭发那·富马亲王殿下所指出过的，在我们两国之间没有任何争执，彼此一直在一条共同的边界的两边和平相处。我们深信，这一次以梭发那·富马亲王殿下为首的老挝王国政府代表团前来我国访问，一定会进一步促进我们两国友好关系的发展。中国将坚定不移地在和平共处五项原则的基础上，做老挝的好朋友和好邻居，正如同我们愿意同一切邻国做好朋友和好邻居一样。我们将同老挝一起从各方面来加强我们两国之间的友好合作。
    我提议大家举杯，为中、老两国友好关系的日益发
  展，为亚非人民的团结和万隆精神的胜
  利，为世界和平，为老挝王国的繁荣，为老挝国王西萨汪·冯陛下的健
  康，干杯！梭发那·富马首相的讲话总理先生，阁下们，女士们，先生们！
    首先，我应该以老挝代表团的名义并以我个人名义向你们表达我们诚恳的谢意。
    自从我们踏上中国国土以来，我们不断受到热烈的欢迎和友好的表示，使我们深受感动。
    这种接待使我们高兴，但我们并不觉得惊异。
    实际上，我们是在恢复由于历史变迁而一时中断了的旧日的友好关系。这种友好关系应当是两个邻国相处的准则。在两国关系长期中断和经历了剧烈的动乱以后，中国和老挝恢复了关系，这是合乎常理的事。
    我们非常关心地注视着你们为了在新的基础上建设你们的社会，并在极力尊重你们民族独立的情况下，促进你们的经济繁荣所作的巨大努力。我们十分高兴将在今后几天中能赞赏你们在英明而且强有力的领导者的推动下，在各方面所已经取得的美好成就。
    和中国比较起来，老挝确实是一个小国。我们几乎不能同你们的国家相比。但是，老挝有它本身的问题和它独立的地位，如果你们允许的话，费一些时间同你们谈一谈，我想这是有益处的。
    老挝有着悠久的历史，自从来自中国南部的寮族和泰族人民在原有土著人民的本土定居后，就诞生了这些人民在印度文明的文化和政治基础上建立了兰生王朝的国家。因此，我们的国家同时起原于中国和印度，这是我乐于特别指出的一点。
    老挝从1947年起改组为君主立宪国。我们的独立获得了承认。政治、社会、经济等国内建设工作由于战争状态而难于进行，日内瓦协议结束了这个战争状态。
    自从这个时期以后，执行日内瓦协议中所发生的困难即已获得了解决，因为王国政府和一些寮国人民之间刚刚获得了协议，这个盼望已久的全国一致重归于好的状态使王国能更有效地从事于国家和平建设工作。
    老挝是一个大陆上的小国，周围有强大的邻邦，老挝也是一个有佛教传统的国家，因而也是一个爱好和平的国家，不能说它对邻国会构成一种威胁。由于战争而在不久前所遭受的痛苦，以及它的历史遭遇，使我们的王国对于可能构成外来干涉的一切行为非常敏感。
    老挝只能指望周围邻国的善意和真诚才能继续和平地生存，我们知道，在这样的邻国中，我们是能够把中国计算在内的。
    在我们的对外关系中，我们首先考虑到我们在日内瓦所自愿承担的义务，根据这一义务，只要我们的安全不受到干扰，我们就不参加任何军事同盟。同时，除了日内瓦协议所规定的以外，我们将不允许在我们的领土上建立任何外国基地。另一方面，老挝接受了尼赫鲁所确立的，特别是在1954年中印协定中所规定的五项原则。起源于佛教戒律并和亚非会议各原则有密切关系的这五项原则，对我们来说是一种道德上的义务，而且使我们对于我们的友邦有了信心。我们认为如果这些原则能够被诚恳地接受并付之实施，那末，国与国之间的关系就会变得更加和好。
    因此，我们的政策主要是中立政策。老挝不参加任何大国集团。我们愿意和所有邻邦和平共处，专心致力于国家建设问题。
    我所以在这些问题上多讲了一些，这是因为我们热烈地希望我们的立场，即使不能获得同情，也能得到谅解。我们认为中国和老挝之间制度的不同不应该成为谅解和友谊的障碍。在我们这方面，我们将尊重中华人民共和国的制度。
    我希望老挝代表团的访问将在我们两国之间造成友好的气氛，并对近来我们所看到的世界局势的和缓做出些贡献，我们希望这种世界局势的和缓将是普遍的和全面的，因为这是实现我们衷心祈望的和平的必要条件。
    怀着这种希望，我建议为毛泽东主席的健康，为中国人民的繁荣干杯。
