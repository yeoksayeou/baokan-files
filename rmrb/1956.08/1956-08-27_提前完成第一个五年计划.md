    Completing the First Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Contributions of Local State-Owned Factories in Henan Province
    (Xinhua News Agency) Fifty-two larger local industrial enterprises in Henan Province, including farm tool factories, power plants, coal mines, and flour mills, have completed their Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. More than eighty other larger factories, some are close to completion, while others are working hard to fulfill the various targets set by the Five-Year Plan.
    During the Five-Year Plan period, these factories and mines, which completed their plans ahead of schedule, produced a large amount of means of production and consumer goods. Since 1953, the province's farm tool factories have produced waterwheels averaging seven units for each agricultural production cooperative.
    Due to the development of the power and coal industries, the generating capacity of local state-owned power plants in the province is now more than twenty times greater than in the early post-liberation period. Thanks to the development of local state-owned coal mines specializing in civilian coal production, many rural areas that used firewood as their primary fuel in the past have switched to using coal, freeing up grass for fertilizer or livestock feed.
    With the development of production, these factories and mines that completed their Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule have also undergone significant changes. For example, the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, which completed its Five-Year Plan two years and one month ahead of schedule, had only over a hundred employees and produced only cotton gins, wagon axles, and other products when it was established after liberation. Now, the factory has been rebuilt into a large-scale double-wheel double-furrow plow manufacturing plant with one thousand five hundred employees. With the development of agricultural production, this factory is being expanded into a tractor-drawn farm implements manufacturing plant.
    In 1952, Henan Province's local industry was still a dilapidated mess. At that time, it was difficult to even manufacture ordinary waterwheels in the machinery industry. But now, it can manufacture more technically complex rapid waterwheels and Henan heavy-duty Liberation-style waterwheels. Various new types of farm implements such as locomotive boilers, water pumps, double-wheel double-furrow plows, horse-drawn cotton seeders, and horse-drawn wheeled sprayers can also be manufactured. The new product recently produced by Luoyang Machinery Factory - a two-wheeled engine roller - has also been sold to India.

    Seventeen Months Ahead of Schedule
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th) Shanxi Machinery Factory, the largest local state-owned factory in Shanxi Province, has fully completed the First Five-Year Plan seventeen months ahead of schedule. By July 9th of this year, the total output value of this factory had reached the planned level for 1957; the main products that met the quality standards - various drilling rigs - exceeded the original plan by sixty-nine units, and the double-wheel double-furrow plows were also completed in the quantity required by the state. During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, this factory, which could only produce waterwheels, walking plows, and repair machinery, became a comprehensive machinery factory capable of producing precision mining machinery and advanced farm implements in large quantities.
    In more than three years, this factory has successfully trial-produced sixty-two new products to transform agricultural technology and support state-owned industry. When the upsurge of national agricultural collectivization arrived last year, the factory's workers promptly supplied 68,000 double-wheel double-furrow plows to rural areas across the country; the drilling rigs they produced for geological exploration departments also increased year by year, producing 700 various drilling rigs in the past three years. In April of this year, they also successfully trial-produced a 500-meter drilling rig, and more than 140 units have been shipped to various drilling sites. Now, various mining machinery and equipment have become the factory's main products.

    Good News from Kunming
    (Our newspaper's telegram from Kunming) Kunming Electric Motor Factory and the 311 Youth Advanced Drilling Team completed the First Five-Year Plan eighteen months ahead of schedule. Since the launch of the advanced producers movement at Kunming Electric Motor Factory this year, a total of twenty-six types of advanced experiences have been promoted, and two hundred and sixty-six rationalization proposals have been adopted, which have greatly helped to improve production efficiency. During the movement, a large number of production experts emerged, with five hundred and sixty-two people exceeding their work quotas. The 311 Youth Advanced Drilling Team of the First Detachment of the 308 Team has promoted ten advanced experiences this year, and has conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. The monthly drilling efficiency has exceeded 300 meters, the core recovery rate has also exceeded the national target, and costs have been reduced by about 50%. Since June 25th, they have already been working on the Second Five-Year Plan.

    提前完成第一个五年计划
    河南省地方国营工厂的贡献
    据新华社讯　河南省地方工业有五十二个较大的农具制造厂、电厂、煤矿、面粉厂等企业提前完成了五年计划。其余八十多个较大的工厂，有的已经接近完成，有的正在努力完成五年计划所规定的各项指标。
    这一批提前完成五年计划的厂矿，在五年计划期间曾经生产了大量的生产资料和生活资料。全省农具制造厂从1953年以来生产的水车平均能使每个农业生产合作社分到七部。
    由于电业和煤矿生产的发展，现在全省地方国营发电厂的发电能力比解放初期增加了二十多倍。由于专门生产民用煤的地方国营煤矿生产的发展，许多过去用柴草作主要燃料的农村，已经改用煤作燃料，腾出草来沤肥或作牲畜饲草。
    这些提前完成五年计划的厂矿，随着生产的发展，企业面貌也发生了很大的变化。例如提前两年零一个月完成五年计划的开封机械厂，解放后建厂时只有一百多名职工，出产的东西只是轧花机、马车轴等产品；现在，这个厂已改建成一座规模很大的双轮双铧犁制造厂，有一千五百多名职工。随着农业生产的发展，这个工厂正在扩建成为一个拖拉机曳引农具的制造厂。
    1952年河南省地方工业还是一个破烂摊子。那时机械工业方面连制造普通的水车都很困难。但是现在已能制造技术比较复杂的快速水车和河南重型解放式水车了。各种新式农具如锅驼机、水泵、双轮双铧犁、马拉棉花播种机、马拉轮动式喷雾器等也都能够制造。洛阳机械厂最近出产的新产品——两轮引擎压路机还远销到印度。
    提前了十七个月
    新华社太原25日电　山西省最大的地方国营工厂——山西机器厂提前十七个月全面完成了第一个五年计划。这个厂到今年7月9日的生产总值，已经达到1957年的计划水平；合乎质量的主要产品——各种钻探机，比原计划超额完成了六十九台，双轮双铧犁也按国家要求的数量完成。在执行第一个五年计划期间，这个原来只能生产水车、步犁和修理机械的工厂，变成能够大批生产精密的矿山机械和高级农具的综合机器工厂了。
    在三年多的时间里，这个厂为改造农业技术和支援国营工业试制成功的新产品有六十二种。工厂职工在去年全国农业合作化高潮到来的时候，及时供应了全国各地农村六万八千部双轮双铧犁；他们为地质勘探部门生产的钻探机也逐年增加，三年来生产了七百台各种钻探机。今年4月份又试制成功了五百米钻探机，现在已有一百四十多台运往各钻探工地。现在，各种矿山机械设备成了这个工厂的主要产品。
    来自昆明的捷报
    本报昆明电　云南省昆明电机厂和三一一青年先进机场提前十八个月完成第一个五年计划。昆明电机厂从今年先进生产者运动开展以来，共推广了二十六种先进经验，采纳了二百六十六件合理化建议，对提高生产效率起了很大作用。在运动中，生产能手大批涌现，有五百六十二人突破了工时定额。三○八队一分队三一一青年先进机场，今年推广了十项先进经验，并且认真执行了苏联专家的建议，台月效率超过了三百公尺，岩芯采取率也超过了国家指标，还降低了成本50％左右。从6月25日起，他们已经在做第二个五年计划的工作了。
