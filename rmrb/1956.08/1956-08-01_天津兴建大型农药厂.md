    Tianjin to Build Large-Scale Pesticide Factory
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin) A large-scale “1605” pesticide manufacturing plant, capable of meeting the national demand for pest control in cotton fields, has recently begun construction in Tianjin; it is expected to be completed by early next year.

    According to its design capacity, the plant will be able to produce 1,500 tons of 46.6% pure “1605” emulsion annually upon completion.

    “1605” pesticide is a highly effective drug for controlling pests such as cotton aphids and red spiders in cotton fields; only one kilogram is needed for 320 acres of cotton fields.

    Currently, all the "1605" pesticide used in our country is imported.

    天津兴建大型农药厂
    新华社天津讯　一个能够满足全国棉田灭虫需要的大型“一六零五”农药制造厂，最近开始在天津动工兴建；预计到明年年初就能全部建成。
    按照设计能力，这个厂建成之后，每年能产纯度46.6％的“一六零五”乳剂一千五百吨。
    “一六零五”农药是防治棉田里的棉蚜虫和红蜘蛛等害虫的特效药，在三百二十亩棉田里，只要施用一公斤就够了。
    目前，我国所使用的“一六零五”农药，全部是进口的。
