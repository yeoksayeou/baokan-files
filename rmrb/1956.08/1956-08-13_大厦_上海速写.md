    The Mansion
    ——A Shanghai Sketch
    He Wei
    At most, it was only two or three years ago. At that time, from Nanjing West Road, Tongren Road, and Yan'an West Road to Weihaiwei Road, the area was completely surrounded by a deep ochre wall. The lime on the wall was peeling off, wild grass grew everywhere, and there was a constant danger of collapse, yet the heavy doors remained locked year after year. Peering through the dilapidated cracks in the door, one could only see desolation. When passing by at night, a corner of a dangerous building vaguely emerged from the darkness, gloomy and seemingly uninhabited for years; but on stormy nights, a dim yellow light would occasionally shine from the dangerous building, like a sly eye. This solitary lamp added to the dark and bizarre feeling of the corner of the building, making everything within the wall even more mysterious and unpredictable.

    Who would have thought that this place was originally the largest and most magnificent garden in downtown Shanghai: "Aili Garden," but Shanghainese usually called it "Hardoon Garden." Hardoon was the private owner of this garden, a foreign speculator who made his fortune by exploiting the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. It is said that in this garden, all the pavilions, terraces, rockeries, and ponds were designed and built according to the layout of the Grand View Garden in "Dream of the Red Chamber."

    This "Aili Garden" eventually only had an empty shell left, and in the end, even the empty shell was gone, leaving only a dilapidated ruin. This ruin was truly out of harmony with a large city undergoing socialist construction.

    One day, a large team suddenly arrived here: a large number of construction workers appeared inside and outside the shell of the "Grand View Garden." Inside the dilapidated walls, cranes waved their long arms, and excavators made deafening noises, sweeping away those dangerous buildings and dilapidated walls, and completely eliminating all the decaying and moldy buildings with a destructive force.

    On this foundation, "a ten-thousand-foot building rises from the ground." In just ten months, Shanghai's first socialist mansion—the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building—was built. If Shanghai's various tall buildings are compared to mountain peaks, then the red star on the spire of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building is the peak of the mountains.

    Every time I walk or drive past this brand-new building, or even just approach the edge of the mansion, I always feel extremely refreshed. The open sidewalks are new; the neat trees along the road are new; the beautiful street lights among the trees are also new; everything within sight is new. And this newness is shared by the people.

    In the past, the ochre wall with its mottled lime, and the corner of the dangerous building of the "Grand View Garden," have not yet disappeared from my memory. Now, in the blink of an eye, that pile of ruins has been swept away. Before my eyes is a completely new set of ivory-colored, magnificent buildings, layer upon layer of solemn and magnificent floors, set off by four small golden pagodas, and the five-pointed red star on the large golden pagoda in the center, under the blue sky and white clouds, is truly magnificent, like a magical illustration from some fairy tale.

    I like to stroll on the sidewalks near the mansion that are full of flowers and trees, and I often linger, reluctant to leave. As I look around, my thoughts always take flight, full of fantasies, and I want more people to share the joy in my heart.

### 大厦——上海速写
何为

    大厦
    ——上海速写
    何为
    这顶多不过是二三年前，那时候，从南京西路、铜仁路、延安西路直到威海卫路之间，四周团团地被一堵深赭色墙垣包围起来。墙头石灰剥落，野草丛生，时刻都有倾塌的危险，可是还长年重门深锁。在破败的门缝间望进去，只见一片荒凉。夜晚路过的时候，黑暗中隐约露出危楼一角，阴森森的，像是多少年来就没有住过一个人；可是在风雨之夜，危楼里也时或透出一盏昏黄的灯光，有如一只诡谲的眼睛。这只孤灯，使得楼台一角更增添了阴暗怪诞的感觉，这围墙里的一切也就更显得神秘莫测了。
    谁想得到，这里最早原是上海市区中最大最华丽的一个花园：“爱俪园”，但上海人通常称之为“哈同花园”。哈同，就是这个花园的私有者，是靠着剥削中国人血汗起家的外国投机家。据说在这个花园里，所有的亭台楼阁，假山池塘，都是按照“红楼梦”中大观园的布局设计建筑起来的。
    这个“爱俪园”后来终于只剩下了一个空架子，最后连空架子也没有了，只剩下一个残败不堪的废墟。这个废墟，对于正在进行社会主义建设的大城市说来，真是太不调和了。
    有一天，这里突然开到了一支庞大的队伍：“大观园”破壳子的里里外外，出现了大批建筑工人。在破旧的墙头里面，起重机挥动着长长的手臂，挖土机发出震耳的响声，把那些危楼残壁，一扫而光，所有陈腐发霉的建筑物，摧枯拉朽地全部扫除了。
    就在这块地基上，“万丈高楼平地起”，只用了十个月时间，造起了上海第一个社会主义大厦——中苏友好大厦。假如把上海的各种高楼大厦，比作是一座一座的山峰，那么，中苏友好大厦塔尖上的红星，就是群山的峰巅了。
    每次步行或车过这座崭新的建筑物时，甚至于仅仅接近大厦的边缘，总有一种极其爽朗的感觉。这开阔的行人道，是新的；道旁整齐的树木，是新的；树木中间漂亮的路灯，也是新的；凡是眼睛所及，什么都是新的。而这新的，是人民共有的。
    从前，那石灰斑剥的赭色围墙，还有那“大观园”的危楼一角，一时还没有在我的记忆中消失。现在一眨眼睛，那堆废墟一下子摔掉了。在我的眼前，是一组全新的象牙色的伟大建筑，重重叠叠、庄严瑰丽的层楼，烘托着四个小金塔，正中一个大金塔顶上的五角红星，在蓝天白云下，真是气象万千，仿佛是哪本童话里神奇的插图。
    我喜欢在大厦附近满植花树的人行道上散步，每每流连不忍遽去。顾盼之间，又总是神思飞越，独多幻想，而且愿意更多的人分享我内心的喜悦。
