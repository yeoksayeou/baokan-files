Columnist's Commentary:

　　Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk traveled to Europe in May and returned to Phnom Penh on August 20th. He was greeted by an unprecedentedly grand welcome from the people of Phnom Penh, because the achievements of this trip reflected the Cambodian people's desire for peace and friendship. During his trip, Prince Sihanouk visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other European countries, and engaged in contact and talks with the leaders of these countries. This not only strengthened Cambodia's friendship with these countries but also brought a positive influence to world peace.
　　Cambodia is a newly emerging Asian country. After embarking on the road to independence, it adopted a neutral policy and pursued the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Although certain groups in the United States have tried in every possible way to push Cambodia onto another path, the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, have bravely resisted foreign interference and maintained Cambodia's neutrality. It is now very clear that Cambodia's adoption of this policy is very beneficial both for consolidating Cambodia's independence, for maintaining peace in Indochina, and for promoting the cause of international cooperation. Prince Sihanouk's visit to European countries fully demonstrated the positive significance of implementing a policy of peaceful neutrality.
　　During his visit to Europe, Prince Sihanouk pointed out: "The neutrality we have adopted is neither imposed on us by others nor is it passive. Its purpose is to strengthen our country's independence." He also said that due to the implementation of the neutrality policy, Cambodia should "increase contact with all countries that wish to establish friendly and beneficial relations with us, without exception." Cambodia's position has gained increasing sympathy, respect, and support from more and more countries.
　　The joint communiqués of Prince Sihanouk's talks with the leaders of Poland, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia all pointed out that relations between their countries should be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. On this basis, the political and economic relations between Cambodia and these socialist countries have developed. Cambodia and the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia decided to exchange diplomatic envoys, and Soviet leaders accepted Prince Sihanouk's invitation to visit Cambodia. At the same time, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to provide technical and economic assistance to Cambodia without attaching any political conditions and with full respect for Cambodia's independent sovereignty. Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia also decided to strengthen their economic cooperation with Cambodia. All this will undoubtedly facilitate Cambodia's development of its own economy. Therefore, Cambodia's friendly relations with socialist countries not only do not harm Cambodia's neutral status but will only further consolidate its neutrality and independence.
　　As Cambodia's close neighbor and friend, the Chinese people are willing to see Cambodia's independence increasingly consolidated and its international status increasingly elevated. During his visit to Europe, Prince Sihanouk supported China's legitimate status in the United Nations, saying: "We believe that for the sake of peace, the People's China should have a legitimate place in the United Nations organization, and this is also a matter of justice." The Chinese people cherish this friendship very much and believe that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia will continue to develop.

    西哈努克亲王访问欧洲的成果
    柬埔寨西哈努克亲王在五月间赴欧洲旅行，已于八月二十日回到金边。他受到金边民众空前隆重的迎接，因为这次旅行所获得的成果，反映了柬埔寨人民的和平友好愿望。西哈努克亲王在旅行期间，曾先后访问了波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和欧洲其他国家，并同这些国家的领导人进行了接触和会谈，这不但加强了柬埔寨同这些国家的友谊，而且给世界和平带来良好的影响。
    柬埔寨是一个新兴的亚洲国家。它在走上独立道路以后，就采取了中立政策，并奉行和平共处的五项原则。尽管美国某些集团曾千方百计地想把柬埔寨推上另外一条道路，但是柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，英勇地反抗了外来的干涉，维护了柬埔寨的中立。现在可以看得很清楚，柬埔寨采取这种政策，不论对于巩固柬埔寨的独立，也不论对于维护印度支那的和平和促进国际合作事业，都是非常有益的。西哈努克亲王这次访问欧洲国家，就充分地表现了执行和平中立政策的积极意义。
    西哈努克亲王在访问欧洲期间指出：“我们采取的中立，既不是别人强迫我们接受的，也不是消极的。它的目的是加强我国的独立。”他又说，由于执行中立政策，柬埔寨就要“毫无例外地同一切希望同我们建立友好和有益的关系的国家增加接触”。柬埔寨的这种立场，已经得到愈来愈多的国家的同情、尊重和支持。
    西哈努克亲王同波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫领导人的会谈公报都指出，他们国家之间的关系要以和平共处的原则为基础。在这个基础上，柬埔寨同这些社会主义国家的政治和经济关系都有了发展。柬埔寨同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克决定互派外交使节，苏联领导人并接受西哈努克亲王的邀请，将访问柬埔寨。同时，苏联表示愿意在不附加任何政治条件和充分尊重柬埔寨独立主权的情况下，给予柬埔寨技术和经济的援助。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫也决定加强它们同柬埔寨的经济合作。这一切无疑会便于柬埔寨发展自己的经济。因此，柬埔寨同社会主义国家的友好关系，不但不损害柬埔寨的中立地位，而且只会更加巩固它的中立和独立。
    作为柬埔寨的近邻和朋友，中国人民愿意看到柬埔寨的独立日益巩固，它的国际地位日益提高。西哈努克亲王在访问欧洲期间对中国在联合国的合法地位曾给予支持，他说：“我们认为为了和平的利益，人民中国应当在联合国组织中有合法的地位，这也是一个正义的问题。”中国人民非常珍视这种友谊，并且相信中柬两国的友好关系将得到不断的发展。
