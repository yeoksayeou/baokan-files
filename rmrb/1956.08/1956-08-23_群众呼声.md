    Shandong Civil Affairs Department is Too Careless
    On August 4th of this year, the Laiyang Prefectural Civil Affairs Department received a document from the Shandong Provincial Civil Affairs Department regarding the forwarding of the Ministry of Internal Affairs' notice on rectifying and organizing the production of urban families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and the poor. However, this document only contained the subject matter and omitted the content. On August 6th, the Provincial Civil Affairs Department sent the supplemented content, along with a letter apologizing for the carelessness. However, in this document, "production" was mistakenly written as "life". This March, newspapers announced that Pingdu County, formerly under the jurisdiction of Laiyang Prefecture, had been transferred to Changwei Prefecture. However, this April, the Provincial Civil Affairs Department still introduced demobilized and construction soldiers from Pingdu County to Laiyang Prefecture for job assignments. It is hoped that the Shandong Provincial Civil Affairs Department will be more careful and meticulous in its work in the future.　Zhang Yan
        It is Wrong to Bully Commune Members
    On July 25th, Dai Mingzhi, a sixty-three-year-old commune member of the Huihuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pantuo Township, Qixian County, Shanxi, participated in road repair work for a whole day and only returned home for a meal when it was dark. Just as he lay down to rest, production team leader Dai Desheng came to his home and asked him to watch the field. Dai Mingzhi said he was very tired and requested that someone else be sent. Dai Desheng became angry and left. After a while, he returned to Dai Mingzhi's home with Han Lihua, the deputy leader of the township militia (head of the cooperative security section), and statistician Dai Shifu, all in a threatening manner. As soon as they entered, Han Lihua, without asking any questions, reached out and dragged Dai Mingzhi from the bed to the ground, raising his fist and punching Dai Mingzhi heavily in the chest twice. Dai Shifu said, "Hit him, I'll take responsibility if he dies." At that time, Dai Mingzhi's chest was bruised with two bowl-sized marks, and he was in so much pain that he couldn't get up from the ground and is still in bed recuperating.
    Han Lihua, Dai Desheng, and Dai Shifu, as cadres, have unreasonably violated human rights and bullied elderly commune members. It is hoped that the relevant departments will handle this matter accordingly.

    Stop Constantly Transferring Us to the Countryside
    The cadres of the Party Training Class of the Huaiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party spend more than half of the year being transferred by various departments of the county committee to participate in central rural work or temporary crash tasks. Often, they are transferred to the countryside after one training class ends and only return to the county when another training class begins. Because of this, we often cannot prepare for teaching before the training class starts, nor can we conduct teaching summaries after the training class ends. This seriously affects the teaching quality of the training class.
    I hope that various departments of the Huaiyuan County Committee will reduce the transfer of cadres from the Party Training Class to do central work as much as possible, so that we have time to do our own work well. Li Min
    This Kind of Street Should Be Improved
    The East-West Avenue in the old city of Luoyang is a relatively narrow street. The road surface has been in disrepair for a long time, and the sand and soil have accumulated to a great thickness. When the wind blows, the sand and soil are swept up, making it impossible for pedestrians to open their eyes. At the same time, this street is a public bus route, and whenever a bus passes, the snack stalls are covered with a thick layer of sand and soil, which is very detrimental to the health of the citizens.
    It is suggested that the relevant departments take effective measures to improve this situation. Xiao Ding

    山东民政厅工作太粗心
    今年八月四日，莱阳专署民政科收到山东省民政厅发来一份文件，事由是，转发内务部关于整顿和组织城市烈属、军属和贫民生产的通知，但是这份文件上只有事由，遗漏了内容。八月六日，省民政厅寄来了补发的内容，同时附寄了一封检讨粗技大叶的来信。但是，这份文件上，却又把“生产”错写成“生活”了。今年三月份报纸上已经公布了过去属于莱阳专署管辖的平度县划归昌潍专署了，但是，今年四月份，省民政厅还把平度县的复员建设军人介绍到莱阳专署来分配工作。希望山东省民政厅今后对工作应当认真细心。　张　衍
        不该欺压社员
    七月二十五日，山西祁县盘陀乡辉煌农业生产合作社六十三岁的社员代明志参加了一整天的修路工作，直到天黑时，才回家吃了一顿饭。当他刚躺到床上休息的时候，生产队长代德胜来到他的家里，叫他去看场。代明志说他累得很，请另派一个人去。代德胜听了，生气走了。不一会他又叫了乡武装队的副队长（社保卫股长）韩立华、统计员代世福气势凶凶地来到代明志的家里。一进门，韩立华不问情由，就伸手把代明志从床上拖到地上，举起拳头向代明志的胸脯上重重打了两拳。代世福说：“打吧，打死有我负责”。当时，代明志的胸脯上就被打了碗口大的两块青伤，痛得躺在地上爬不起来，直到现在还躺在床上疗养。
    韩立华、代德胜、代世福身为干部竟然无理侵犯人权，欺压年老的社员，希望有关部门予以处理。

    不要老是抽调我们下乡
    中共怀远县委会党训班的干部，一年就有半年以上的时间，要被县委各部门抽调去参加农村中心工作或临时突击任务。经常是在一期训练班结束之后，被调下乡，另一期训练班开学之时才回到县上。因为这样，我们经常在训练班开学前，无法作教学准备工作；在训练班结束后，又不能作教学总结工作。这就严重地影响着训练班的教学质量。
    我希望怀远县委各部门，尽量少抽调党训班的干部去作中心工作，让我们有时间把本身的工作作得好一些。　黎　民
    这样的街道应该改善
    洛阳市老城区东西大街，是一条比较狭窄的街道。路面久经失修，沙土积得很厚。一刮风，沙土随风卷起，行人无法睁开眼睛。同时，这条街是一条公共汽车路线，汽车一过，零食摊上便扑满了厚厚的一层沙土，这对市民的健康是非常不利的。
    建议有关部门采取有效措施，改善这种情况。　小　钉
