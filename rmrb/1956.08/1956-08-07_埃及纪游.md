    An Egyptian Travelogue

    On the Banks of the Nile

    Beneath the Nile Palace Bridge in Cairo, the Nile River flows silently. The banks are lined with verdant palms and date trees. A north wind fills the white sails dotting the river, easily sailing upstream.

    The Nile is 6,500 kilometers long. The Blue Nile originates from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian highlands, and the White Nile originates from Lake Victoria in the equatorial region of Africa. The Blue and White Niles converge in Khartoum, Sudan, and then flow mightily through the vast desert, transforming the banks into a green corridor.

    Traveling south by train from Cairo, one can see the fields on both sides of the Nile extending from wide to narrow, beyond which lies the endless desert. From Cairo to just south of Luxor, the fields are several miles wide; further south, closer to Aswan, the fields narrow to about a mile. In some places, the bare hills of the desert almost reach the banks of the Nile.

    The Nile flows from south to north, and it is said to have been flowing for ten thousand years. In Egypt's territory of over 990,000 square kilometers, 96.5% of the land is desert, and the population is concentrated in the Nile Delta and the narrow strips of land along the banks. It rarely rains in Egypt. During our fifty days in Egypt, we did not encounter a single rainy day. Egypt's annual rainfall is only six inches, mainly in the Mediterranean coastal region. In southern Egypt, people in their seventies and eighties have never even seen rainwater. Irrigation of farmland depends entirely on the Nile River. The approximately 1,200-kilometer stretch of the Nile that flows through Egypt brings happiness and prosperity to Egypt's more than 20 million people.

    In March and April, the water of the Nile is clear; this is the dry season. Cotton seedlings are already growing vigorously on the banks, and farmers are busy harvesting sugarcane. Dromedary camels carry bundles of sugarcane across the fields. But in July, when the rainy season begins in the Ethiopian mountains north of the equator, the Nile begins to flood, and the river water, laden with silt, turns yellowish and turbid. The water doesn't recede until November. In ancient times, when the Nile flooded, the river overflowed its banks, and when the water receded, it left behind fertile soil. Farmers relied on this natural gift to obtain harvests. So people say that Egypt is a gift of the Nile.

    In modern times, the Nile has even greater significance. The Nile has abundant hydropower resources, which, if rationally utilized, could make the deserts of Egypt bloom with bright red roses.

    Egyptians love the Nile as children love their mother. The ancient Egyptians composed beautiful hymns to the Nile:

    "Glory be to you,
    Nile, originating from the earth,
    You flow tirelessly,
    To revitalize Egypt."

    Egyptians praise the sweetness of the Nile water. There is an Egyptian proverb: "If you drink the water of the Nile, even if you go far away, you will return again." (Attached picture)

    埃及纪游

    尼罗河畔
    在开罗的尼罗宫桥下，尼罗河的水静静地流着。两岸是青翠的棕梠和枣椰树。从北方吹来的风鼓着河上的点点白帆，顺易地逆水而上。
    尼罗河全长六千五百公里。从埃塞俄比亚高原上的塔纳湖发源了青尼罗河，从非洲赤道地区的维多利亚湖发源了白尼罗河，青白尼罗河汇合在苏丹的喀土穆，然后浩浩荡荡流过辽阔无边的大沙漠，把两岸变成了一条绿色的走廊。
    乘火车从开罗到南方旅行，可以见到尼罗河两岸的田野由宽到窄地伸展开来，田野之外就是无尽的荒漠。从开罗到拉克索稍南的地方，两岸田野宽约数哩，再南行渐近阿斯旺，田野窄到一哩左右，在有些地方，沙漠上的光秃秃的山丘几乎接近到尼罗河的岸边。
    尼罗河从南向北地流着，据说，已经流了一万年了。在九十九万多平方公里的埃及领土中，96.5％的土地是沙漠，人口都密集在尼罗河三角洲和两岸的狭长地带。埃及很少下雨。在埃及的五十天中，我们没有遇到过下雨天。埃及的全年雨量才六吋，主要是在靠地中海的地区。在南埃及，那里的七八十岁的老年人甚至没有见过雨水。农田灌溉全靠尼罗河水，约一千二百公里长的一段尼罗河穿过埃及国境，给埃及二千多万个生命带来幸福和繁荣。
    三、四月间，尼罗河的水是清的，这是枯水季节。两岸的棉苗已经茁长，农民们正忙着收割甘蔗，单峰的骆驼驮着一捆捆甘蔗在田野上走着。但到七月间，当赤道以北埃塞俄比亚山岳地带的雨季开始时，尼罗河便开始泛滥，河水夹带着淤泥，呈黄浊色。一直到十一月，才开始退水。在古代，当尼罗河泛滥时，河水溢出两岸，水退时留下了肥沃的泥土，农民就依靠这种自然的赐予来获得收成。所以人们说，埃及是尼罗河的礼物。
    在现代，尼罗河有了更大的意义。尼罗河有着丰富的水力资源，如果加以合理的利用，将能使埃及的沙漠开遍鲜红的玫瑰。
    埃及人爱尼罗河，如同儿女爱他们的母亲。古埃及人就为尼罗编唱他们美丽的赞歌：
    “光荣归于你，
    发源于大地的尼罗，
    你不息地流，
    为的使埃及苏生。”
    埃及人称赞尼罗河水的香甜。在埃及有一句谚语：“你要是饮了尼罗河的水，即使远走了，你也将再回来。”（附图片）
