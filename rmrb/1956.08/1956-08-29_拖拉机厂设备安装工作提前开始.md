Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 27th: The equipment installation at the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, which is under construction, began on the 25th.

On the morning of the 25th, when the installation workers appeared in the auxiliary workshop awaiting installation, a fitter installation team composed of demobilized tank soldiers first opened the sealed crate of an automated lathe from the Dalian Machine Tool Factory and moved out the new machine. At the same time, a group of technicians were also busy marking and positioning the machines in the factory building according to the equipment installation layout drawings, to determine the installation location of these machines.

Since the commencement of civil engineering construction at the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant in September last year, the exterior construction of seven of the eleven main factory buildings has been completed. This has created favorable conditions for equipment installation. In order to accelerate the construction progress, the equipment installation project of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant has been advanced by two months from the original national plan. This year, the factory buildings planned for equipment installation include fourteen workshops in auxiliary, forging, and woodworking workshops. More than 10,000 machines and equipment will be installed in these workshops. In order to complete the equipment installation task ahead of schedule, the installation workers will adopt mechanized construction methods.

    拖拉机厂设备安装工作提前开始
    新华社洛阳27日电　正在建设中的第一拖拉机制造厂，从25日起开始安装设备。
    25日上午，当安装工人们在久待安装的辅助工场出现以后，一个不久以前由坦克兵转业人员组成的钳工安装小组，首先打开了来自大连机床厂的一台自动化车床的封箱，搬出了新机器。在这同时，一批技术人员也在按照设备安装的平面布置图纸，忙着在厂房里进行划线定位工作，来给这些机器确定安装的位置。
    第一拖拉机制造厂从去年9月开始土木建筑施工以来，全厂十一个主厂房的建筑工程目前已有七个完成了外型建筑工程。这给设备安装创造了有利的条件。为了加速建厂进度，第一拖拉机制造厂的设备安装工程，比国家原定计划提前了两个月。今年计划安装设备的厂房有辅助、锻工、木工等工场的十四个车间。在这些车间里，将要安装各种机器设备一万多台。为了提前完成设备安装的任务，安装工人们将采用机械化的施工方法。
