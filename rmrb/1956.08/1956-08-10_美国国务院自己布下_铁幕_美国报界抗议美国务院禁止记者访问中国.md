Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Washington: The U.S. State Department's prohibition of American journalists from visiting China has aroused widespread protest in the American press, with many news organizations demanding that the ban be lifted.

    The chairman of the Freedom of Information Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Herbert Brucker, chief editor of the "Hartford Courant," telegraphed Dulles, saying that the prohibition is "an iron curtain of our own." It "fundamentally violates" the "principle" of freedom of the press.

    The Washington "Star" said that the State Department's refusal to allow American journalists to visit China is tantamount to "erecting its own bamboo curtain."

    An editorial in the "New York Post" condemned the State Department's decision as "dangerous folly." It said: This action "again demonstrates the State Department's infinite ability to make others think of the United States as a stupid, frightened nation."

    "New York Times" reporter Croker pointed out that there are no conditions restricting American journalists from visiting the People's Republic of China. The newspaper condemned the State Department for preventing American journalists from obtaining first-hand information about China. It also said: "Moreover, the spirit of Geneva calls for the continuous development of East-West contacts."

    Theodore Koop, director of CBS's Washington News and Public Affairs Department, wrote to Dulles expressing his "disagreement" with the State Department's ban. He believes that the State Department should reconsider its decision in order to "prevent the allegation that the government is trying to control the activities of American journalists."

    Those who have already submitted opinions and protests to the State Department also include Arthur Hays Sulzberger, president and publisher of the "New York Times"; Frank Starzel, general manager of the Associated Press; Frank H. Bartholomew, president of United Press; Edwin Canham, editor-in-chief of the "Christian Science Monitor," and representatives from CBS and NBC.

    It is reported that almost all news organizations to which the journalists approved by the Chinese government to visit China belong have publicly or privately protested the U.S. State Department's actions.

    The Chinese government recently approved a total of eighteen American journalists to visit China. They are: Sulzberger, Douthit, and Lieberman from the "New York Times"; Walker from the "Christian Science Monitor"; Childs from the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"; Kell from the New York "Herald Tribune"; Fredin from the "New York Post"; Smith from International News Service; Miller from United Press; Roderick from the Associated Press; Xiang Haifei (former reporter for "The Nation" magazine) from CBS; Robinson from NBC; Burke from "Time" and "Life" magazines; Martin from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine; Worthy from "The Crisis" magazine; Kotzmann from "Business Week"; and freelance writers Forman and Sheehan.

    美国国务院自己布下“铁幕”
    美国报界抗议美国务院禁止记者访问中国
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院禁止美国记者到中国去访问这件事情已经引起美国新闻界的广泛抗议，许多新闻机构都要求取消这种禁令。
    美国报纸编辑协会新闻自由委员会主席、“哈脱福特新闻报”主笔赫伯特·布鲁克打电报给杜勒斯说，这种禁止就是“我们自己的一种铁幕”。它“根本违反了”新闻自由的“原则”。
    华盛顿“明星报”说，国务院不许美国记者前往访问中国，等于是“布下了一道自己的竹幕”。
    “纽约邮报”的社论谴责国务院这个决定是“危险的蠢事”。它说：这种行动“再次说明，国务院倒有无限的本事能使别人觉得美国是一个愚蠢的吓坏了的国家”。
    “纽约时报”记者克罗克指出，美国记者访问中华人民共和国是不受任何条件限制的。这家报纸谴责国务院阻止美国记者去取得关于中国的第一手消息。它又说：“而且日内瓦精神要求不断开展东西方的交往。”
    哥伦比亚广播公司华盛顿新闻与公共事务部主任西奥多·科普写信给杜勒斯表示“不同意”国务院的禁令。他认为，国务院应当重新考虑它的决定，这样才能“防止这种说法：政府正在设法控制美国记者的行动”。
    已经向国务院提出意见和表示抗议的还有“纽约时报”社长兼发行人阿瑟·海斯·苏兹贝格；美联社总经理弗兰克·斯塔泽；合众社社长弗兰克·赫·巴塞洛缪；“基督教科学箴言报”总编辑埃德温·坎汉以及哥伦比亚广播公司和全国广播公司的代表。
    据报道，差不多所有得到中国政府批准访问中国的记者所属的新闻机构都公开或私下抗议美国务院的行动。
    中国政府最近批准来中国访问的美国记者共有十八人，他们是：“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格、窦丁和李伯曼，“基督教科学箴言报”记者华克尔，“圣路易邮报”记者蔡尔兹，纽约“先驱论坛报”记者凯尔，“纽约邮报”记者弗雷丁，国际新闻社记者史密斯，合众社记者米勒，美联社记者罗德里克，哥伦比亚广播公司记者（前“民族”周刊记者）香海菲，全国广播公司记者罗宾逊，“时代”和“生活”杂志记者伯克，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志记者马丁，“危机”杂志记者沃西，“商业周刊”记者柯兹曼，自由作家福尔曼和希恩。
