    Massive Waste of Timber by the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau

    Not long ago, I and several comrades went to the Laisugou forest area in Sichuan on official business and discovered that the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau was taking a seriously irresponsible attitude towards the country's forest resources, causing enormous losses.

    In the logging areas of Daniuchang and Xiaoniuchang, etc., which were logged by the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau in 1952, we saw that in these top-quality forest areas, which had an average stock volume of about 600 cubic meters per hectare, an average of more than 370 cubic meters of timber per hectare was left on the ground. Although the logging had taken place several years ago, and much of the timber had deteriorated due to wind and rain, apart from over 100 cubic meters of completely rotten wood, there were still over 80 cubic meters of good quality timber and over 130 cubic meters of secondary timber that could be used as third- or fourth-grade timber according to national regulations per hectare. Moreover, relevant departments had already carried out a clearing operation on these sites in 1954, clearing an average of more than 80 cubic meters of good timber per hectare; otherwise, the good timber we saw being discarded would have been even more abundant.

    In the logging areas harvested in the first half of this year, there was a similar distressing waste phenomenon. In the Mozi Gou Dare North Slope logging area, we saw that the area of felled timber was 500 cubic meters, and 250 cubic meters were discarded, of which over 30 cubic meters were completely rotten wood, and the rest were all good quality and graded timber.

    The timber discarded on both sides of the timber collection roads was equally alarming. On the nearly 1,000-meter-long Xia Mozi Gou timber collection road, we only measured a 50-meter section and found that over 40 cubic meters of timber had been discarded, of which over 30 cubic meters were good quality timber.

    In recent years, the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau has logged a total area of 5,500 hectares of timber. If calculated at 34 cubic meters of good timber discarded per hectare (which is the lowest discard figure for the first half of this year), at least 187,000 cubic meters of good timber have been discarded.

    The logging method of this bureau is also rare in the country. According to regulations, logging should be carried out in a planned manner, but they "eat the fat and discard the lean." Looking at the forest area, it is like a scar everywhere, one piece on the mountain, one piece at the foot of the mountain, one strip on the east slope, one strip on the west slope, and there is no planning to speak of.

    The Sichuan Forestry Administration knows about this bureau's serious phenomenon of wasting timber, but it has not been stopped. We demand that the relevant units immediately correct this wasteful behavior of timber.

### 川西森林工业局浪费大量木材

    川西森林工业局浪费大量木材
    不久以前，我和几个同志因公去四川来苏沟林区，发现川西森林工业局对国家的森林资源采取严重的不负责任的态度，造成了极大的损失。
    我们在川西森林工业局1952年采伐过的大牛场和小牛场等采伐迹地上，看见这些被采伐过的、平均每公顷蓄积量约有六百立方公尺的头等林区里，平均每公顷就有三百七十多立方公尺的木材被丢在地上。虽然采伐的时间已经过去好几年，很多木材被风吹雨打变质了，但这中间除有一百多立方公尺是全朽材以外，每公顷仍有八十多立方公尺好材，一百三十多立方公尺按国家规定可以作三等材或四等材使用的次材。而且，1954年有关部门已经在这些迹地上做过一次清除工作，平均每公顷清除出八十多立方公尺的好材；否则，我们看到的被丢掉的好材还要多得多呢。
    在今年上半年采伐的迹地上，同样有这种令人痛心的浪费现象。我们在磨子沟胆敢北坡采伐迹地上，看见被伐倒的木材面积有五百立方公尺，而被丢掉的就有二百五十立方公尺，其中除三十多立方公尺是全朽材以外，其余全都是好材和等内材。
    集材道两旁被丢掉的木材，也是同样惊人的。在近一千公尺长的下磨子沟集材道上，我们只量过其中五十公尺的距离，被丢掉的木材就有四十多立方公尺，这中间有三十多立方公尺都是好材。
    几年来，川西森林工业局共采伐了五千五百公顷面积的木材。如果按每公顷丢掉三十四立方公尺好材计算（这是今年上半年最低的丢掉数字），被丢掉的好材至少有十八万七千多立方公尺。
    这个局的采伐方式也是全国少有的。按规定应该是有计划地采伐，可是他们却“吃肥丢瘦”。走到林区一看，到处像疮疤一样，山上一片，山下一片，东坡一条，西坡一条，根本谈不上计划。
    川西森林工业局这种糟蹋木材的严重现象，四川森林工业管理局是知道的，但一直没有制止。我们要求有关单位立即纠正这种浪费木材的行为。
