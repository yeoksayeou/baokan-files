Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS reported on the 7th that Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov said that air force and nuclear weapons cannot determine the outcome of armed struggle. In modern warfare, a large number of troops are still needed. Therefore, the Soviet Union's massive reduction of armed forces is not based on the nature of the envisioned modern combat methods, but to ease international tensions and to benefit the development of the Soviet Union's peaceful economy.

Marshal Zhukov expressed his above views in a letter to Hanson Baldwin, the military editor of the American "New York Times," on August 4th. In this letter, he answered six questions raised by Baldwin in his letter to him on July 7th.

Air Force and Nuclear Weapons Cannot Determine the Outcome of War

Baldwin's first two questions were: "Do you think the United States has exaggerated the strength of the Soviet Air Force?" "As a continental power, the Soviet Union now attaches particular importance to the Air Force; in your opinion, does this mean that the Air Force and nuclear weapons are now the dominant military branches in war?"

Zhukov said: I do not have exact materials to determine how the United States estimates the Soviet Air Force. It is possible that some people in the United States, especially those concerned with military orders, like to exaggerate the number of the Soviet Air Force in order to increase military spending and create an atmosphere of distrust towards the Soviet Union.

The air force and nuclear weapons themselves cannot determine the outcome of armed struggle. Despite the enormous destructive power of atomic and hydrogen weapons, a large number of troops and a large amount of conventional armaments will inevitably be used in military operations in addition to these weapons.

Soviet Disarmament is for Consolidating Peace and Developing the Economy

Baldwin asked: Does the Soviet Union's announcement of the demobilization of 1.8 million people reflect the trend of modern combat methods? In other words, will the power of nuclear weapons plus aircraft and missiles weaken the role of large armies and naval surface fleets? In the eyes of Americans, your demobilization does not seem to have affected the most important and obviously the most decisive part of the armed forces - the air force and nuclear weapons. Is this statement correct?

Zhukov said: Americans who are hostile to the Soviet Union will always view any Soviet measure negatively and very subjectively. The Soviet government's decision to reduce troops is not due to the nature of the envisioned modern combat methods, nor is it due to the so-called trends of modern combat methods. On this issue, our starting point is primarily to consolidate world peace and ease international tensions, and to benefit the development of the Soviet peaceful economy and improve the material welfare of the Soviet people.

Effective Disarmament Supervision Must Be Carried Out

Baldwin asked Zhukov that the United States has expressed its willingness to allow mutual aerial and ground inspections to supervise disarmament. If the Soviet Union demobilizes a large number of troops, then why does it not agree to allow people to conduct such inspections?

Zhukov said that the system of supervision through aerial photography proposed by the United States is essentially nothing more than reconnaissance activities, and therefore will inevitably lead to mutual suspicion and make the distrust between the Soviet Union and the United States even more serious.

On the other hand, the Soviet proposal stipulates the establishment of an international supervision system that can effectively guarantee the implementation of disarmament supervision.

The Soviet Union advocates that the established supervision should enable the supervisory body to truly check the implementation of each country's disarmament obligations.

I think it is not necessary to explain in more detail the difference between the objectives to be achieved by effective international supervision and the aerial reconnaissance and aerial photography methods proposed by the United States.

The Soviet Union Firmly Opposes Large and Small Wars

The other two questions Baldwin asked Zhukov were: "Do you think it is possible to conduct small-scale wars or any other wars without the use of nuclear weapons?" "Why does the Soviet Union manufacture so many submarines?"

Zhukov replied: The Soviet Union firmly opposes large and small wars. Any war is destructive, and a war using nuclear weapons is extremely dangerous not only for the belligerent countries but also for non-belligerent countries.

The Soviet Union only manufactures what is needed to defend the country and does not manufacture anything superfluous. The coastline of the Soviet Union accounts for about two-thirds of the total length of its borders. Therefore, the Soviet Union, as a major maritime power, should of course give appropriate attention to the navy to ensure the safety of its coastline.

### 朱可夫元帅答“纽约时报”记者问  苏联裁军是为了缓和国际紧张局势

    朱可夫元帅答“纽约时报”记者问
    苏联裁军是为了缓和国际紧张局势
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社七日报道：苏联国防部长朱可夫说，空军和核子武器不能决定武装斗争的结局。在现代战争中仍然需要大量的军队。因此，苏联大量裁减武装部队并不是考虑到设想中的现代作战方法的性质，而是为了缓和国际紧张局势和有利于发展苏联的和平经济。
    朱可夫元帅在他八月四日给美国“纽约时报”军事编辑汉逊·鲍德温的一封信中表示了他上面的看法。他在这封信中回答了鲍德温七月七日在写给他的信中提出的六个问题。
  空军和核子武器不能决定战争结局
    鲍德温提出的头两个问题是：“你是不是认为，美国夸大了苏联空军的实力？”“作为一个大陆大国，苏联现在特别重视空军；照你看，这是不是意味着空军和核子武器现在是战争中占支配地位的军种？”
    朱可夫说：我没有确切的材料来判定美国在对苏联的空军作怎样的估计。可能美国某些人士，特别是关心军事订货的人，喜欢夸大苏联空军的人数，以便有利于增加军费和制造对苏联的不信任气氛。
    空军和核子武器本身不能决定武装斗争的结局。尽管原子武器和氢武器有着巨大的破坏力，但是在军事行动中除了这种武器以外必然要使用大批军队和大量常规军备。
  苏联裁军为了巩固和平和发展经济
    鲍德温问：苏联宣布复员一百八十万人是否反映现代作战方法的趋势？换句话说，核子武器加上飞机和导弹的力量是否会减弱大量军队和海军水面舰队的作用？在美国人看来，你们的复员似乎没有影响到武装部队中最重要的而且显然也是最具有决定意义的一部分——空军和核子武器。这种说法是否正确呢？
    朱可夫说：敌视苏联的美国人对苏联任何措施的看法永远都是否定的、非常不客观的。苏联政府裁减军队的决定并不是由于考虑到设想中的现代作战方法的性质，也不是由于考虑到所谓现代作战方法的趋势。在这个问题上，我们的出发点首先是考虑到巩固世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势，是为了利于发展苏联和平经济和提高苏联人民的物质福利。
    必须进行有效的裁军监督
    鲍德温问朱可夫，美国已经表示愿意允许双方互相进行空中和地面视察，以对裁军进行监督。假如苏联将大量兵员复员，那么为什么它不答应让人家进行这种视察呢？
    朱可夫说，美国所建议的以空中摄影来进行监督的制度，实质上不外是展开侦察活动，因此免不了要引起相互的怀疑，使得苏联和美国之间的不信任更加严重。
    另一方面，苏联的建议规定建立的一种国际监督制度，能够切实地保障监督裁军的实行。
    苏联主张，所建立的监督应当使监督机构有可能真正检查各国履行自己的裁军义务的情况。
    我认为，没有必要更详细地说明有效的国际监督以及美国所建议的空中侦察和空中摄影这两种办法所要达到的目的有什么不同。
    苏联坚决反对大小战争
    鲍德温向朱可夫提出的另外两个问题是：“你认为是不是有可能进行不使用核子武器的小规模战争或者任何其他战争？”、“为什么苏联制造这么多的潜水艇呢？”
    朱可夫回答说：苏联坚决反对大小战争。任何战争都是破坏性的，而使用核子武器的战争不但对交战国而且对非交战国都是十分危险的。
    苏联只制造保卫国家所需要的东西，不制造任何多余的东西。苏联的海岸线约占国境总长度的三分之二。因此，苏联这样一个海上大国，当然应该对保证海岸线安全的海军给以适当的注意。
