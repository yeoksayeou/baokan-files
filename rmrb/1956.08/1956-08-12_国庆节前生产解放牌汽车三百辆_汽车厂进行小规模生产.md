Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 10th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Kang Guozhi): After the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was built and successfully trial-produced a batch of cars, it is now organizing small-scale car production using assembly line methods in preparation for full-scale production.

From the starting point of production—raw material preparation—to the end point of production—the final assembly of cars—all workshops in the factory are gradually forming an assembly line production entity. Various parts flow forward successively along a certain assembly line through one process after another, and finally converge in the car final assembly workshop. The 150-plus-meter-long final assembly line is often full of cars. At the end of this assembly line, brand new Liberation brand cars have been assembled every day since July 23. Car production is gradually increasing according to plan.

Organizing small-scale production in the manner of large-scale assembly line production is an important measure for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to prepare for the transition to full-scale production. Through small-scale production, the factory can achieve better coordination and collaboration in all aspects of production and supply; the factory workers can also further familiarize themselves with the technology and master the skills. Since the start of small-scale production, many problems affecting car assembly have been discovered successively. These problems are being addressed one by one through daily factory production scheduling meetings.

The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has increased its original plan to produce 250 cars before National Day to 300 cars.

    国庆节前生产解放牌汽车三百辆
    汽车厂进行小规模生产
    据新华社长春10日电　新华社记者康国志报道：第一汽车制造厂建成并试制成功一批汽车以后，现在正在采用流水作业的方式组织小规模的汽车生产，为全面开工生产作准备。
    全厂各个车间从生产的起点——毛胚（材料）准备到生产的终点——汽车的总装配，正逐步形成一个流水作业的生产整体。各种零件沿着一定的流水生产线经过一道又一道工序陆续向前流动，最后汇集到汽车总装配车间。一百五十多公尺长的总装配线上，汽车经常摆得满满的。在这条装配线的末端，从七月二十三日开始，每天都有崭新的解放牌汽车装配出来。汽车的产量正按照计划逐渐增加。
    按照大量流水生产的方式组织小规模生产，是第一汽车制造厂准备过渡到全面开工生产的重要措施。通过小规模生产，可以使工厂在生产、供应等各个环节得到更好的配合协作；工厂职工们也可以进一步熟悉工艺和掌握技术。自从小规模生产开始以来，已经陆续发现了影响汽车装配的许多问题。这些问题通过每天召开的全厂生产调度会议正在设法逐一解决。
    第一汽车制造厂已经将原计划在国庆节以前生产二百五十辆汽车增加为三百辆。
