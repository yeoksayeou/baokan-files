Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 13th: Guizhou Province has recently and extensively inspected the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions. This inspection began in June. When conducting the inspection, the Bijie Special District organized more than 500 cadres from counties and districts to go deep into 113 townships to assist in the work, holding座谈会(zuò談huì) (symposiums/discussion forums) in these townships to solicit opinions from people of all ethnic groups. He章县(Hèzhāng xiàn) (Hezhang County) also held a people's representative conference of all ethnic groups to conduct inspections.

Insufficient consideration of ethnic characteristics in the agricultural cooperative movement was a major problem identified during this inspection in various regions. Now, many places have already taken action or are in the process of doing so. He章县(Hèzhāng xiàn) (Hezhang County), 纳雍县(Nàyōng xiàn) (Nayong County) and five other counties have re-processed the "彩牛(cǎi niú)" (decorated bulls), "麻园(má yuán)" (hemp fields), and "跳花坡(tiào huā pō)" (flower-dancing slopes - *translator's note: a place where young men and women meet for social activities*) of the minority nationalities in ethnic联合社(liánhéshè) (united co-ops) and ethnic communities that should not have been included in the社(shè) (co-op). Jin沙县(Jīnshā xiàn) (Jinsha County) had the cooperatives return approximately 56 mu of hemp fields to farmers of all ethnic groups for self-management and use, as well as more than 600 special-use cattle, and twelve "跳花坡(tiào huā pō)" (flower-dancing slopes).

After conducting the inspections, many counties have summarized their work, affirming their achievements while also providing detailed analysis of the causes of shortcomings and errors. They also put forward preliminary opinions on implementing ethnic policies in all future work and overcoming the shortcomings of generalizing work in minority areas.

Through this inspection, the ideological understanding of both cadres and the masses has greatly improved. The secretary of the CCP郎岱县(Lángdài xiàn) (Langdai County) 新场区(Xīnchǎng qū) (Xinchang District) Committee said: "In the past, I thought that since the landlord class had been overthrown, there were no more ethnic issues. After this inspection, I realized that in the past, the neglect of ethnic issues in the agricultural cooperative movement had brought some shortcomings and errors to the work." When the Ma江县(Májiāng xiàn) (Majiang County) work group went deep into the ethnic minority areas to conduct inspections, the local people were very excited. They said that the Communist Party really cares about us and wants to do everything well for us.

    贵州普遍检查民族政策执行情况
    纠正合作化中忽视民族特点的现象
    新华社贵阳13日电　贵州省各地最近普遍深入地检查了执行民族政策的情况。这次检查是从六月份开始的。毕节专区各县，在进行检查的时候组织了县、区干部五百多人，深入到113个乡帮助工作，在这些乡普遍召开了座谈会，征求了各族人民的意见。赫章县还召开了各族人民代表会议进行检查。
    在农业合作化运动中照顾民族特点不够，是各地这次检查出来的一个主要问题。现在，许多地方都已作了处理或正在处理。赫章、纳雍等五个县，对民族联合社和民族社内，不宜入社而入了社的少数民族的“彩牛”、“麻园”、“跳花坡”（本报编者按：彩牛，是贵州苗族人民专门养来斗牛用的牛，一般不耕田；麻园，是贵州苗族未嫁姑娘的私有地，一般用来种麻；跳花坡，是苗族青年男女在节日或农闲时进行社交活动的场所。）重新进行了处理。金沙县由合作社退给各族农民自行经营和使用的麻园地约有五十六亩，特殊用牛六百多头，“跳花坡”十二处。
    许多县在进行了检查后，都作出了工作总结，在肯定成绩的同时，详细分析了产生缺点和错误的原因，并提出了今后在各种工作中贯彻执行民族政策、克服在少数民族地区工作一般化的缺点的初步意见。
    经过这次检查，干部和群众的思想认识都有了很大提高。中共郎岱县新场区区委书记说：“过去我认为地主阶级已经被打倒，便没有民族问题了。经过这次检查，我才认识到过去在农业合作化运动中，由于忽视民族问题而给工作带来了一些缺点和错误。”麻江县工作组深入边沿民族聚居乡进行检查的时候，当地群众都很兴奋，他们说，共产党确实是关心我们的，而且样样事情都要给我们办好。
