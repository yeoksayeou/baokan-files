Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 26th: The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is leading Party organizations at the grassroots level to actively improve the working and living conditions of senior intellectuals.

In the past, senior intellectuals in Xi'an generally felt that there were insufficient books and materials and too many concurrent posts in scientific research work. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to allocate 60,000 yuan to purchase a batch of scientific books, and is also starting to compile a catalog of domestic and foreign periodicals and a bibliography of existing scientific and technical books of the municipal units so that each unit can borrow them as needed. Northwest University, Northwest Russian College and other units are also stepping up efforts to enrich books and materials. The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Local Industry and other units are drafting some measures for senior intellectuals to visit factories and construction sites.

The problem of senior intellectuals holding too many concurrent posts is also being addressed. In addition, several units under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau and Northwest University have recently opened some study rooms or studios for chief engineers and professors with special achievements in their units to use for specialized research. Xi'an Central Hospital, Northwest Engineering Management Bureau and other departments have equipped chief physicians and chief engineers with work assistants to help them collect and organize materials and handle some routine administrative work.

Regarding the living problems of senior intellectuals, the Party organizations of various units in Xi'an have also suggested that the administration provide care and assistance. Universities and engineering and technical departments have generally established small canteens or special tables for senior intellectuals to use, and the supply and marketing cooperatives of some units have set up shopping places for senior intellectuals, where they can buy things as they arrive without having to queue. Some hospitals in Xi'an have also set up special clinics for senior intellectuals. Some units have also made appropriate arrangements for the transportation problems of senior intellectuals when they go out.

In order to strengthen the leadership of intellectuals' work, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has successively convened symposiums of senior intellectuals to solicit their opinions and requirements, and recently formulated a two-year (1956-1957) plan for intellectuals' work in Xi'an. This plan requires that 70% of professors, associate professors, and lecturers in universities and colleges should be able to participate in scientific research work in 1957.

    中共西安市委采取许多具体措施
    改善高级知识分子的工作和生活条件
    新华社西安26日电　中共西安市委员会领导各基层党组织，积极改善高级知识分子的工作和生活条件。
    西安市的高级知识分子过去在科学研究工作中普遍感到图书资料不足和兼职过多。中共西安市委员会已决定拨款六万元购买一批科学图书，同时并着手汇编国内外期刊目录和市属各单位现有科学技术书目，以便各单位按需要借阅。西北大学，西北俄文专科学校等单位也在加紧充实图书资料。西安市地方工业局等单位正在拟订高级知识分子参观工厂、工地的一些办法。
    高级知识分子兼职过多的问题，有关方面也正在着手解决。此外，西北工程管理总局所属几个单位和西北大学最近相继开辟了一些书房或工作室，供本单位有特殊成就的总工程师、教授们进行专门研究时使用。西安市中心医院、西北工程管理总局等部门已为本单位的主治医师、总工程师等配备了工作助手，协助他们收集整理资料和处理一些日常事务工作。
    对于高级知识分子的生活问题，西安市各单位的党组织也都建议行政予以照顾和帮助。各个高等学校和工程技术部门现在普遍设立了供高级知识分子用膳的小食堂或专用桌，有的单位的供销合作社设立了高级知识分子购物处，随到随买，不需要排队。西安市有些医院还设立了高级知识分子特诊室。有些单位对高级知识分子出外的交通问题也作了适当解决。
    中共西安市委员会为加强对知识分子工作的领导，曾先后召集高级知识分子座谈，征求他们的意见和要求，最近并制定了关于西安市知识分子工作的两年（1956—1957）规划。这个规划中要求高等学校的教授、副教授、讲师在1957年应有70％的人都能参加科学研究工作。
