    Strolling Through the Book Forest
    Anonymous: "Ink Lady's Small Records"
    Xidì
    On a bookshelf in an antique bookstore, I saw a pocket-sized book titled "Ink Lady's Small Records." The title was very strange. I didn't know what the book was about, so I took it down to read. It turned out to be something along the lines of "Miscellaneous Skills and Humble Matters." I don't know when it was written. There was a preface titled by Yushu Zhenlin of Wulin, dated Guangxu Guiwei (1883 AD). There was also a preface by Xuepu Shannong, explicitly stating that it was a re-engraving by Hu Junwenhuan during the Longqing period of the Ming Dynasty. It contains many manufacturing secrets, planting techniques, and poultry raising dos and don'ts, perfume recipes, dominoes scores, etc. Many of the small, wonderful skills have "subtle and insightful points." Later in Shanghai, I obtained a Ming Dynasty edition that had already had the title changed. After returning to Beijing, I acquired another Ming Dynasty engraved edition by Hu Wenhuan at the Suiyazhai, the so-called "Gezhi Series." In order to clarify the origin of this book, I went to the Beijing Library to examine the collection of (1) the Ming Dynasty blue grid manuscript formerly in the Tianyi Pavilion and (2) the Wu Ji edition of Longqing Xinwei (1571 AD) of the Ming Dynasty. Neither of these two are likely to be the complete book. The Hu Wenhuan edition has fourteen volumes, while the Tianyi Pavilion edition has only the first five volumes, and the Wu Ji edition has only the first six volumes. The seventh volume and beyond are missing from the Wu edition. It is suspected that the original was complete. Wu Ji's preface says: "From literature and art, planting, food and drink, managing life, to all kinds of entertainment, nothing is abandoned. Like Yuan Kai's arsenal, everything is readily available. I don't know who compiled it, and it has not been published. It has been obscure and buried for a long time. A guest visited me, and we read it together. He thought it was very detailed for the daily needs of the people. It fills in the gaps in books like 'Essential Household Matters' and 'Illustrated Compendium of Practical Skills.' By examining it and responding to events, the foolish can become wise, and the clumsy can become skillful. Engraving and spreading it will also enlighten the world." Planting, food and drink, and managing life are in volumes eight to eleven. This proves that Wu Ji's edition is not missing, only that the Wu edition in the collection of the Beijing Library is a fragment. The pocket-sized edition engraved during the Guangxu period is also not complete. Only the Hu Wenhuan edition is the most complete. Many of the secrets and tricks described in this book can indeed supplement what is missing from the "Miscellaneous Skills and Humble Matters" books. But there are even more absurd and unfounded words. Cultivating oneself and nourishing one's nature, and burning and refining elixirs, were the fantasies of some scholar-officials since the mid-Ming Dynasty. Some people actually believed it to be true, believing that immortals could be attained and immortal realms could be ascended to. The drama "Record of Cultivating Culture" written by Tu Long is truly "a tale of absurdity." This trend became more and more prevalent. It was not until the peasant revolution that the bureaucratic landlords were awakened from their dream of immortality. But apart from those unbelievable absurdities, there are still many good achievements and recorded experiences in science and technology in the "Small Records." Although the creators and inventors of these achievements and experiences have lost their names, they are worthy of attention and preservation, and even should be promoted in daily application and the history of science and technology. For example, there are two methods for making paste:
    [Paste Method] Frankincense, Bletilla striata powder (ie, facial powder), alum, yellow wax, and glue, plus calcium hydroxide (lime), will last for a hundred years.
    [Adhesive Paste] Add a little Bletilla striata powder and bean flour to the paste, and it will never come off. The method for gluing porcelain is: "Mix glutinous rice porridge with egg white, grind it thoroughly, and add a little powder, then grind it again before using, it's very effective." These can be promoted after they have been tested and proven effective. There are many more "tricks" like this. Also, "Pancakes that stay soft for three to five days" says: "Add a little salt and honey when mixing the dough, and it will never harden for three to five days." If this method is tested and proven effective, it will be quite related to people's livelihood. In particular, the "Arts and Drama" section (Volume 6) contains many words related to ancient "chemical changes." For example, there are many recipes for making "fireworks." There are two recipes for "lead to tin transformation." There are many dyeing methods. They call those chemical changes "arts and drama," just as they use the invention of "gunpowder" for firecrackers and fireworks. Some new things may be found in those game items. Also, each copy of this book may "come later and surpass," adding some "things" to it. Wu Ji's engraved edition has several more items than the Ming Dynasty manuscript. For example, the three items from "Thousand Li Tea" (Volume 4) and the five items from "Cure for Dry Hemorrhoids" (Volume 5) are additions to the engraved edition that are not in the manuscript. Many books like this were written after the mid-Ming Dynasty. The "Gezhi Series," "Yimen Guangdu," and "Baoyantang Secret Collection" contain many of them. Only Gao Lian's ("Jade Hairpin" author) "Zunsheng Bajian" is published separately. They often encompass everything, and pay particular attention to cultivating one's nature and practicing the art of immortality, sitting in meditation and refining elixir, which are generally the same as the "Ink Lady's Small Records." I will only talk about the earliest "Ink Lady's Small Records" and not mention the others.

    漫步书林
    无名氏：“墨娥小录”
    西谛
    在一家古书店的架上，看到一函袖珍本的书，题作“墨娥小录”。这书名甚奇。不知道书里究竟讲的是什么。便取下来看，原来是“多能鄙事”这一类的东西，也不知是何时人写作的。首有一序，题光绪癸未（公元1883年）武林玉书振麟氏隶。又有学圃山农一序，明说是明隆庆间胡君文焕所重刊的。其中多有制造秘方、种植巧技和养禽宜忌，香谱、牙牌谱等。小小妙术，多有“谈言微中”之处。后在上海，得明刻本一部，已将书名改过。回到北京后，又在邃雅斋获明胡文焕刻本一部，即所谓“格致丛书”本的。为了要搞清楚这一部的来源，又到北京图书馆检阅馆藏的（一）天一阁旧藏明蓝格抄本和（二）明隆庆辛未（公元1571年）吴继刊本。这两部恐怕都不是全书。胡文焕本凡十四卷，天一阁本却只有头五卷，吴继刊本却只有头六卷。第七卷以后，不知吴本为何脱落了。颇疑原来是完全的。吴继的序说道：“自文艺、种植、服食、治生，以至诸凡怡玩，一切不废。如元凯武库，随取具足。不知辑于何许人，并无脱稿行世。晦且湮者亦既久矣。客有访余，出共阅之。以为民生日用所需甚悉。居家必用及多能鄙事，便民图纂类诸所未备者，聿皆裁之。按简应事，则愚可明，拙可巧。锓而广之，亦觉世之一道也。”按种植、服食、治生诸类在第八卷到十一卷里。由此可证吴继刊本并不缺，惟北京图书馆所藏吴本，却是一个残本耳。光绪间刻的袖珍本也非全书。独胡文焕本最为完备。本书所述的秘方妙诀，有不少的确可补“多能鄙事”诸书之所未备。但荒诞无稽的话却更多。修真养性，丹房烧炼，乃是明代中叶以来一部分士大夫们的幻想。居然有人信以为真，以为仙人可致，仙境可登。像屠隆所作的“修文记”剧曲，就真的是“满纸荒唐言”也。这个风气越传越盛。直到农民大革命起来之后，官僚地主们的修仙迷梦方才被惊醒了。但除了那些不经的荒诞之谈以外，“小录”里毕竟还有不少科学技术方面的好的成就和经验的记录。这些成就和经验，其创始者和发明者们，虽都已姓氏湮如，但在日常应用上和科学技术史上，却大是值得注意保存之，甚至应该加以发扬光大之的。譬如，造浆糊就有两法：
    〔糊法〕　乳香、白芨粉（即腻粉），明矾黄蜡胶更兼白石钳（石灰也），永保百年牢。
    〔粘合糊〕　糊内入白芨末豆粉少许，永不脱。粘瓷器法是：“糯米粥和鸡子清，研极胶粘，入粉些少，再研用，妙甚”。这些都是可以在试验有效后加以推广的。像这一类的“玩意儿”还多得很呢。又像“打饼三五日尚软条”云：“和面时入盐、蜜各少许在内，可留三五日永不硬”。这方法如果试之有效，和民生是颇有关系的。其中“艺术戏剧”一门（卷六），尤多有关古代的“化学变化”的话。像造“烟火”就有很多的方子。像“铅化锡”就有两个方子。染色的方法尤多。他们把那些化学变化都叫做“艺术戏剧”，正如把“火药”的发明，用作炮仗和烟火一样。在那些游戏项目里，可能会找出些新的东西来。又这书的每个本子，可能都会“后来居上”，新增些“东西”进去。吴继的刻本，就比明抄本多出若干则来。像“千里茶”（卷四）以下三则，“枯痔药方”（卷五）以下五则，都是抄本所无而为刻本所增的。像这一类书，明代中叶以后，写作得甚多。在“格致丛书”、“夷门广牍”和“宝颜堂秘笈”里就收有不少部。独高濂（作“玉簪记”的）的“遵生八笺”是单行的。它们往往包罗万象，而尤着意于养性修真、打坐练丹诸术，与“墨娥小录”大体是同一类的东西。我只举最早的一部“墨娥小录”谈谈，不再话及其它的了。
