    Measures for Handling Submissions and Letters

    Since the revision of this newspaper, it has received enthusiastic support from the broad readership. The number of submissions and letters we receive is increasing daily. In July, we received more than 31,000 submissions and letters, an increase of 9,000 compared to June. The number of submissions and letters received daily was around 800 in the first week of July, and exceeded 1,300 in the last week. The increase in submissions and letters has greatly enriched the content of the newspaper. According to the statistics for July, the number of reader letters published in the newspaper averaged around 4,000 characters per issue, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.

    Currently, due to the fact that the number of editorial staff cannot increase along with the increase in submissions and letters, we have encountered practical difficulties in handling submissions and letters. In the future, general submissions and letters will not be answered individually but will be handled according to different situations; unused manuscripts will generally not be returned. We hope authors and readers will forgive us.

    处理来稿来信的办法
    自从本报改版以来，得到广大读者的热情支持。我们收到的来稿来信，日有增加。七月份共收到来稿来信三万一千多件，比六月份增加九千件。每天收到来稿来信的数目，七月份第一周是八百件上下，最后一周已超过一千三百件。来稿和来信的增加，大大充实了报纸的内容，据七月份的统计，报上刊用读者来信的数字，每期平均就在四千字上下，这是十分可喜的现象。
    目前，由于编辑部工作人员，不可能随着来信来稿的增加而增加，因之，在处理来稿来信工作上，碰到了实际的困难。以后，对于一般来稿来信，都不能一一作复，将分别不同情况，进行处理；对不用的稿件一般也不退还。希作者和读者原谅。
