To Truly Distribute Cash to Commune Members

Grain Bureau Distributes, Credit Cooperative Mobilizes to Recover

The People's Committee of Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, in order to solve the practical difficulties of farmers in production and life, ordered the Grain Bureau to pay a portion of the early rice procurement funds to the agricultural cooperatives in advance. After receiving the cash, many members of the agricultural cooperatives happily bought daily necessities such as oil, salt, and rain hats; some bought piglets to raise.

However, the situation was different in Xieleqiao Township. When the Grain Bureau sent the funds to the agricultural cooperatives, cadres from the credit cooperative mobilized each cooperative to deduct loan repayments. For example, after the Zhutian Cooperative received 3,600 yuan in advance procurement funds, only 826 yuan was actually distributed to the members after deducting loan repayments, deposits, and various fees, accounting for only a little less than 23%. Out of the 539 households in the cooperative, each household could only receive an average of 1.53 yuan. The most received was 3 yuan, and the least was 0.5 yuan.

The situation in Huitang Cooperative was similar. Out of the 800 yuan of advance payment received, 352.44 yuan was used to repay the credit cooperative, more than 100 yuan was retained by the cooperative as a contingency fund, and only 311.5 yuan was distributed to the members. Out of the 125 households in the cooperative, 40 households did not receive any cash. A member named Liu Ganlin, according to the early rice pre-distribution plan, received only 3 yuan in cash in addition to food rations, but the credit cooperative deducted 10 yuan in cash to repay the loan. A poor peasant member originally had a 50-斤 piglet, but sold it due to financial difficulties; he planned to use the money from the early rice pre-distribution to buy a pig, but the credit cooperative deducted 15 yuan, and he only received 5 yuan, making it impossible to buy a pig.

After the township Party branch and the county Party committee work team discovered the above situation, they immediately ordered the credit cooperative to correct it.　Peng Longxian

Empty Joy

In Yao Village District, Qufu County, Shandong Province, wheat production generally increased this year, and the income of commune members generally increased. Everyone said in unison: "The advanced cooperative is really good, with high yields and large income." After half a year of intense labor, the pre-distribution of wheat was implemented, and the members were even happier. Long before the pre-distribution of wheat, the members were planning how much cloth to buy, what clothes to make, how much oil and salt to buy, and so on. However, the district and township cadres also made expenditure plans for them in advance, and the members' plans fell through. For example, in the Zhongmin Agricultural Cooperative, according to the estimated yield calculation, each household member could receive more than 30 yuan, and the least could receive more than 10 yuan, in addition to the grain distribution. This small income was gone after this deduction and that deduction. The first production team, with 66 households, received more than 1,100 yuan in cash, but after deducting 329 yuan for public bonds, 179 yuan for loan repayments, 631 yuan for deposits, and 31 yuan for deducting supply and marketing and credit cooperative shares, all the cash distribution was handled cleanly without going through the hands of the members. At the "mobilization" deposit meeting, an old lady proposed to divide the remaining four or five yuan to her so that she could buy a jacket for her daughter and daughter-in-law. Even this request was not accepted, and she had no choice but to report the deposit herself. The members were generally dissatisfied. They said: The cooperative is good, but it is too strict and there is no money to spend. Some people said: The right hand distributes money, and the left hand collects money, making the members feel "empty joy."　Li Weiye

Random Deductions

Currently, there is a very bad phenomenon in the rural areas of Guizhou: Whenever cash is distributed in agricultural cooperatives, whether it is summer harvest distribution or sideline pre-payment, as soon as the news spreads, many departments that need money swarm up. The People's Bank deducts loans, the supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives deduct shares, and the township people's committees deduct public bonds. After this deduction and that deduction, the members nominally received a lot, but actually received very little, making the members very embarrassed. The Pingba Agricultural Cooperative in Xingqun Township, Jinsha County, received 425 yuan from selling wheat, but after seven deductions and eight deductions, only 138 yuan was distributed to 13 household members. In addition, 21 household members not only did not receive any money, but also had to pay out money. The cooperative only had 1.6 yuan left as public accumulation. Now there is no money to buy plowshares, and the tobacco curing room is broken and cannot be repaired.

Randomly deducting money from members has become a trend. Loans that are due are deducted, and loans that are not due are also deducted. Some departments adopt the method of "strike first to gain the upper hand" and deduct first. Their reason is: "If we don't deduct, other departments will deduct; if we don't deduct first, it will be difficult to collect money after others have deducted everything." Some staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives in Shuicheng County see farmers selling some local specialties and sideline products, they take the goods and don't give money. Some farmers who owe money have to change their names and surnames when selling things, and dare not tell their real names. Some departments collect loans without even notifying the agricultural cooperatives and members, secretly deducting the deposits of agricultural cooperatives and members. In this way, those that should be deducted later are deducted earlier, those that should not be deducted are also deducted, those that are not collected openly are deducted secretly, and every department "strikes", and the victims are of course the cooperatives and members.

Collecting loans, collecting shares, collecting public bonds, and collecting payments for goods are all legitimate things. As long as you discuss with the agricultural cooperatives and members and collect them in installments and batches, the problems in all aspects can be properly solved. Why should you recklessly deduct everything?

“The Cooperative Has Plenty of Money, So It's Easy to Get Things Done,”
But Members Are Dissatisfied Because They Have No Money

The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Shiwuli Yuan District, Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, after the wheat was harvested, the cooperative and the members with surplus grain sold 100,007 斤 of high-quality wheat to the state in one go, receiving 9,580 yuan in grain payments. This money originally had its proper way out, but after the money was received, the cooperative cadres had various plans. Some cadres advocated using more money for basic construction such as digging wells, and some advocated buying耕牛 farm tools. In fact, the cooperative has 250 large cattle and 35 double-share plows, which is completely sufficient and there is no need to buy them. It is also not suitable to dig wells in summer. Some advocated that all the surplus grain payments that should be distributed to the members should be deducted as investment. Some said: "It's easy to get things done when the cooperative has plenty of money, and it's convenient to use it. There's no need to go to east and west, and beg the members for incense from door to door." In this way, all the surplus grain payments were kept in the cooperative. As a result, the members' emotions were greatly affected. Member Yang Xiaomu said: "I haven't even been able to get money to buy salt after working for half a year. Who will work again!"

After the Party branch learned about this situation, it educated the cooperative cadres and helped the cooperative management committee to reasonably allocate the money for buying surplus grain. The surplus grain payment belonging to the entire cooperative was mainly used for current production investment and repayment of fertilizer bills for grain-deficient members, and loan repayments. The surplus grain payment of the members was all returned to the members who sold the surplus grain for them to dispose of themselves. In this way, the members' emotions turned for the better.

### 要把现金真正分到社员手里

    要把现金真正分到社员手里
    粮食股发放出去，信用社动员回来
    湖南省宁乡县人民委员会为了解决农民生产生活上的实际困难，责令粮食股给农业社提前支付一部分早稻收购款。许多农业社的社员们分到现款以后，高兴地买了油、盐、斗笠等日常用品；有的买了小猪来喂养。
    但在偕乐桥乡就不是这样了。当粮食股将款送到农业社的时候，信用社干部就挨社进行动员，要农业社扣还借款。如竹田社领到了预支收购款三千六百元以后，除了还款、存款和留各种费用，实际分给社员的只剩八百二十六元了，仅占23％弱。全社五百三十九户，每户平均只能分一元五角三分。实分下来，最多的分三元，最少的分五角。
    灰汤社的情况也是如此。提前领来的八百元预付款，扣还信用社即用去了三百五十二元四角四分，社里留了一百多元机动款，分给社员的仅三百十一元五角。全社一百二十五户，有四十户未分到现款。社员刘干林，按早稻预分方案，除分得口粮以外，只有三元现金，而信用社却扣了十元现金还贷款。有个贫农社员原来有一个五十斤的小猪，因生活困难卖掉了；计划在早稻预分中支钱买个猪，结果信用社扣去十五元，自己只领得五元钱，无法买猪了。
    上述情况乡党总支及县委工作组发现以后，已立即责成信用社进行纠正。　彭隆贤
    空喜欢
    山东省曲阜县姚村区，今年小麦普遍增产，社员们普遍增加了收入，大家异口同声地说：“高级社真不错，产量高，收入大”。经过半年的紧张劳动，实行小麦预分，社员更加欢喜。早在小麦预分以前，社员们就盘算着买多少布，作什么衣服，买多少油盐等等。可是，区、乡干部也早给他们做了支出计划，社员们的打算都落空了。例如中民农业社，根据估产试算，每户社员除分了粮食以外，多的还能分三十多元，少的十多元。这一项不大的收入，经过这扣那扣以后，也就完了。第一生产队，有六十六户社员，分钱一千一百多元，扣除公债款三百二十九元、还贷款一百七十九元、存款六百三十一元、扣供销、信贷股金三十一元。这样，全部的现金分配不经社员之手即处理得干干净净。在“动员”存款大会上，有一老大娘提出将扣除剩下的四、五元钱分给她，好给姑娘、媳妇买件褂子穿。就连这个要求也未被接受，她只好无可奈何地自报存上了。社员普遍不满意。他们说：合作社好是好，就是卡得死没钱花。有的人说：右手分钱，左手收钱，弄的社员“空喜欢”。　李伟业
    乱扣一通
    目前，在贵州农村里有一种很不好的现象：每当农业社里分配现金的时候，不管是夏收分配，或是副业预支，只要一听到风声，许多要钱的部门就一拥而上。人民银行扣贷款，供销合作社和信用合作社扣股金，乡人民委员会扣公债。这扣那扣，名义上社员分了不少，实际上分到手的没有几个，弄的社员很狼狈。金沙县醒群乡平坝农业社卖小麦得钱四百二十五元，被七扣八扣，只剩下一百三十八元分给了十三户社员。另外二十一户社员不但分不到钱，还得倒补出钱来。社里也只剩下了一元六角钱作为公积金。现在缺少铧口没有钱买，烤烟叶的烤房坏了也修不成。
    乱扣社员的钱，已成了一种风气，到期的贷款扣，不到期的也扣。有的部门是采取“先下手为强”的办法，抢先扣。他们的理由是：“我们不扣，别的部门也要扣；要不先扣，等别人扣光了，再收钱就困难了。”水城县有些供销社的工作人员，看到农民卖点土特产和副产品，就把货收下，不给钱。有些欠款的农民卖东西只好改名换姓，不敢说出自己的真名字。有的部门收贷款，甚至不通知农业社和社员，暗地里扣农业社和社员的存款。这样，该晚扣的早扣，不该扣的也扣，不明收却暗扣，每个部门都“下手”，遭殃的当然是社和社员。
    收贷款、收股金、收公债、收货款都是正当的事情。只要同农业社和社员商量好，分期分批地收回，各方面的问题都可以适当解决，为什么要不顾一切地乱扣一通呢？

    “社里钱多好办事”，
    社员没钱不满意
    山东省寿张县十五里园区红星农业社，麦子打下场以后，社和有余粮的社员一次卖了上等小麦100，007斤给国家，得到九千五百八十元的粮款。这笔钱本来就有它适当的出路的，可是钱拿到手以后，社干部们却有了各种打算。有的干部主张把钱往基本建设如打井等事项上多用一些，有的主张买耕牛农具。其实，社里有二百五十头大牛、三十五部双铧犁，完全够用，用不着买。夏季打井也不合适。有的主张应分给社员的余粮款，也全部扣作投资。有的说：“社里钱多好办事，用着方便，不用走东家跑西家，挨门拜户地向社员求香火了。”就这样，全部余粮款都留到社里了。这样一来，社员的情绪大受影响。社员杨效木说：“干了半年连个买盐的钱也分不到，谁还再干呀！”
    党支部知道这个情况，对社干部进行了教育，帮助社管理委员会合理支配了买余粮的钱。属于全社的余粮款，主要用于当前的生产投资和归还缺粮社员的肥料账，并归还贷款。社员的余粮款全部还给卖了余粮的社员，由他们自己支配。这样，社员的情绪才好转过来。
