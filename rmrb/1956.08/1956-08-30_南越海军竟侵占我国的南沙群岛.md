    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th. According to a report by foreign news agencies on the 27th, quoting a Saigon "authority," in recent days, South Vietnamese naval landing forces have "secretly" landed on China's Nansha Islands, planted the South Vietnamese flag, and erected "boundary markers."
    Saigon's "Chung Sheng Bao" has published two photos of South Vietnamese naval personnel landing on the Nansha Islands, confirming the South Vietnamese authorities' act of infringing on Chinese territory.
    The South Vietnamese authorities have previously revealed their ambition to covet China's South China Sea islands. The South Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued successive statements in early June, saying that it has "traditional sovereignty" over China's Nansha and Xisha Islands.

    南越海军竟侵占我国的南沙群岛
    新华社河内29日电　据外国通讯社27日引西贡“权威人士”宣布的消息，最近几天，南越海军登陆部队已经“偷偷地”在中国的南沙群岛登陆，插上南越旗子，并且立下“界标”。
    西贡的“钟声报”已经刊登了两张南越海军人员在南沙群岛登陆的照片，证实南越当局侵犯中国领土的行为。
    南越当局在以前就流露过它觊觎中国南海岛屿的野心。南越外交部在6月初曾经接连发表声明，说什么它对我国领土南沙群岛和西沙群岛有“传统的主权”。
