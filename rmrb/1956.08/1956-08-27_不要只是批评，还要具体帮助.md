Don't Just Criticize, Offer Concrete Help
By Our Correspondent Qin Junguang

The Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory plays an important role in the basic construction of Yunnan, and many local industrial enterprises, mines, and other basic construction units rely on the factory for the supply of bricks and tiles. They have signed contracts with many units, but they cannot fulfill the contracts on time, in quality, or in quantity. Since the factory officially went into production in July 1954, it has not fully completed its production tasks in any single month for more than two years. Seven leaders have been changed in succession in this factory, but none of them has changed the backward state of the enterprise.

In these two years, many leading units and newspapers have criticized the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory. Last year, the Kunming Municipal People's Committee Supervisory Bureau inspected their work and concluded that they had "many defects, much absenteeism, and many accidents." From March to July of this year, the Kunming Municipal Trade Union criticized the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory several times in a row, saying that they "do not pay attention to ideological education," "do not attach importance to workers' sports activities," and "do not care about improving workers' living conditions," and so on, a whole host of shortcomings. Comrades from the Provincial Department of Industry who went to the factory to inspect the work also said: "This factory is the most troublesome factory. Not only does it fail to complete its tasks, but it also does not care about the lives of the workers. Many workers are not at ease with their work at the brick and tile factory, and absenteeism is very serious." Ma Kongzhi, director of the Provincial Department of Industry, even criticized the factory director, saying: "I have seen many factory directors, but I have never seen a factory director as irresponsible as you, so insensitive to new things." On June 25 and 28, many workers from the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory published articles in the Yunnan Daily, criticizing the factory for not doing many things that could be done. On July 19, Comrade Ding Jing also published an article in the People's Daily, second edition, entitled "Finding the Reasons," saying: "The Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory often works overtime, and often finds reasons, but the result is getting worse and worse. I think the leaders of these factories should quickly come out of their offices and find the real reasons with the workers and learn their lessons, so as not to repeat the same mistakes."

It should be said that the shortcomings pointed out in these criticisms do exist. However, these criticisms and accusations have not produced positive results in more than two years, nor have they helped the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory to get rid of its "backward" label; on the contrary, they have put a heavy pressure on the leaders here, making them feel wronged and unable to hold their heads up. This cannot but make people pay attention to what measures should be taken to help this long-standing backward factory move forward? Should we continue to adopt the simple method of criticizing and accusing, or should we take concrete measures to help solve practical difficulties?

The Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory's long-term failure to complete its plan has many objective difficulties. The production conditions of this factory are very poor, and three of the four workshops are open-air operations. Yunnan has several months of rainy season every year. Every time it rains, the workers in these three workshops have to stop working. Once they stop working, the production order is disrupted, and the completion of the production task is affected. The tunnel kiln needs blanks every day, but the storage and transportation workshop does not have artificial drying equipment. Millions of brick blanks are stacked in the whole factory, relying on more than 40 workers to uncover the straw mats on sunny days to dry in the sun, and quickly cover them when it rains.

The difficulty of drying semi-finished products has brought great losses to production. Workers have made many suggestions to the leaders, and they have also calculated the losses for the leaders: each straw mat costs three corners, and the whole factory needs more than 110,000 straw mats, which need to be replaced once a quarter, and the money for buying straw mats alone is more than 20,000 yuan a year; a rain will damage many brick blanks, and also turn many finished products into substandard products and waste products. If we add up the cost of buying straw mats and the loss of brick blanks and finished products in the past two years, it would be enough to build an artificial drying room. The factory director was happy to hear this account, but he could not do anything because there was no money for industrial investment. The first factory director, Wang Jingrui, said: "When the factory was designed, there was originally artificial drying equipment, but the higher authorities cut this item in order to save funds."

Although the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory fails to complete its tasks every quarter, its production tasks increase year by year. Last year, the state gave them a production task of 27 million bricks and 1.08 million tiles; this year's production task is 30.59 million bricks and 2.86 million tiles. With the increase in production tasks, the number of workers has also increased from 500 to more than 1,000. However, the workers' dormitories have not increased accordingly. The dormitories are overcrowded, and three shifts of workers live together day and night. The clinic has only one surgeon, who also works as an internist, pediatrician, gynecologist, and otolaryngologist. On average, he sees about 150 patients a day, sometimes more than 200. One doctor can't handle it all. Including family members, there are 1,500 to 1,600 people in the factory, but only two barbers. There are more than 400 female workers and family members, but only two bathtubs. In one dormitory, more than 400 employees have only one toilet, and there are only six pits in the toilet. Workers line up to use the toilet early in the morning, which delays a lot of work. This is why the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory "does not attach importance to improving workers' living conditions."

Yes, it seems that the problem is indeed like this. There are so many broken bricks and tiles in the brick and tile factory, how can even a toilet not be solved! The vice chairman of the trade union, Dai Guangsheng, said: "The factory fails to complete its production tasks every month, where does the enterprise bonus fund come from? Besides, the Provincial Department of Industry does not allow 'random' additions to fixed assets!" Last year, they used broken bricks and old wood to build a soybean milk room and a pumping room (which are now workers' dormitories), and the financial department of the Provincial Department of Industry criticized them for "random construction, illegal construction, and violation of the enterprise's fixed asset management regulations." The General Affairs Section knew that there were not enough toilets, but they had to ignore it for fear of criticism.

Those who come here to inspect the work are aware of these situations. However, they did not seriously help the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory solve these practical difficulties, but only criticized and accused it blindly. Therefore, after criticism and accusation, the difficulties are still difficulties, the problems are still problems, and the backwardness is still backwardness.

Give the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory some concrete help! Only by not only criticizing and accusing, but also specifically helping them solve some practical problems, can the backwardness of the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory be reversed.

    不要只是批评，还要具体帮助
    本报记者　秦军光
    云南砖瓦厂在云南的基本建设中，起着重要的作用，许多地方工业厂矿以及其它基本建设单位，都要依靠这个工厂供应砖瓦。他们同许多单位订立了合同，却不能按期、按质、按量履行合同。从1954年7月这个工厂正式投入生产以来，两年多的时间内，没有一个月全面完成过生产任务。这个工厂前后更动了七个领导人员，可是哪一个领导人员也没有改变企业的落后状况。
    这两年内，不少领导单位和报纸都批评过云南砖瓦厂。昆明市人民委员会监察局去年检查了他们的工作，给他们作了“废品多、旷工多、事故多”的结论。昆明市工会今年3月至7月，连续对云南砖瓦厂进行了几次批评，说他们“不注意思想教育”，“不重视职工体育活动”，“不关心改善职工生活条件”等等，缺点一大堆。省工业厅下厂检查工作的同志也说：“这个厂是最头痛的厂，不但完不成任务，也最不关心工人生活，许多工人不安心砖瓦厂的工作，旷工缺勤十分严重。”省工业厅厅长马孔智甚至批评厂长说：“见过许多厂长，就没见过你这样不负责的厂长，对新鲜事物如此不敏感。”6月25、28两日，云南砖瓦厂许多工人在云南日报上发表了文章，批评厂里许多可以办到的事情没有办到。7月19日人民日报二版丁井同志也以“找原因”为题，发表文章说：“云南砖瓦厂经常加班加点，也经常找出原因，其结果愈来愈糟。我看，这些厂的领导人应该赶快从办公室里走出来，同工人群众一起找寻真正的原因，接受教训，以免重蹈复辙。”
    应该说，这些批评中指出的缺点，都是有的。可是两年多来这些批评、指责，并没有产生积极效果，也没有帮助云南砖瓦厂摘掉“落后”的帽子；相反地，却给这里的领导人员一种沉重的压力，使他们感到委屈，抬不起头来。这就不能不使人注意到底应该采取什么办法来帮助这个长久落后的工厂前进呢？是继续采取单纯指责批评的办法呢？还是采取具体帮助解决实际困难的办法呢？
    云南砖瓦厂长期完不成计划，在客观上是有许多困难的。这个工厂的生产条件很不好，四个车间有三个车间是露天作业。云南每年有几个月的雨季，每次下雨，这三个车间的工人就要窝工，一经窝工，生产秩序就乱了，生产任务的完成就受到影响。轮窑每天要坯，而储运车间却没有人工干燥室的设备，全场堆了几百万块砖坯，依靠四十多个工人，天晴把草席掀开，借阳光干燥，雨来赶紧盖上。
    半成品干燥的困难，给生产上带来了很大的损失。工人向领导上提过许多次建议，也曾为这笔损失向领导上算过账：每张草席三角钱，全场需要十一万多张草席，一个季度就要更换一次，每年光买草席的钱就是二万多元；一场雨要损失许多砖坯，又使许多成品变成了次品、废品。若把近两年买草席的钱和砖坯，成品的损失费用加在一起，足够盖个人工干燥室。这笔账，厂长听了心里喜欢，可是工业投资没有这笔钱也就无能为力。第一任厂长王景瑞说：“建厂设计的时候，本来有人工干燥室的设备，但是上级为了节约资金，把这一项给削去了。”
    云南砖瓦厂虽然每一个季度都完不成任务，可是生产任务逐年增加。去年国家给他们的生产任务是砖二千七百万块，瓦一百零八万块；今年的生产任务是砖三千零五十九万块，瓦二百八十六万块。随着生产任务的增加，工人也由五百人增加到一千多人。可是工人的宿舍没有相应地增加。宿舍拥挤不堪，日夜三班工人同住一起。医务室只有一个外科医生，兼任了内科、儿科、妇科、耳鼻喉科几门工作，平时看病平均一天一百五十人左右，有时达二百多人。一个医生怎么也看不过来。连家属在内，全厂有一千五、六百人，只有两个理发员。女工和家属四百多人，只有两个浴盆。有一处宿舍，四百多职工只有一个厕所，厕所里只有六个坑洞，早起工人们排着队上厕所，耽误很多工作。这就是云南砖瓦厂“不重视改善职工生活条件”。
    是啊，看起来问题确实是这样。在砖瓦厂，破砖烂瓦那么多，怎么连个厕所都不能解决呢！工会的副主席戴光生说：“厂里每个月都完不成生产任务，哪里来的企业奖励基金呢？再说，工业厅也不许‘随便’增添固定资产呀！”去年，他们用碎砖头旧木料盖了间豆浆房、抽水房（现在都成了职工宿舍），工业厅财务部门批评他们是“乱施工，乱建筑，违犯企业固定资产管理规定”。总务科明知道厕所不够用，为了怕批评也只得不管了。
    这些情况，来这里检查工作的同志，都是了解的。可是，他们并没有认真帮助云南砖瓦厂解决这些实际存在的困难问题，只是一味地批评、指责，因而批评了、指责了，困难还是困难，问题还是问题，落后还是落后。
    给云南砖瓦厂一些具体帮助吧！只有不只是批评、指责，而且同时具体帮助他们解决一些实际问题，才能扭转云南砖瓦厂的落后面貌。
