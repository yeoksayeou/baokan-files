Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: Indonesian President Sukarno said today that Asian and African countries should declare "No Intervention in Egypt!" to those countries that want to trample on Egypt's sovereignty because Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company.

He pointed out that those who doubt Egypt's ability to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal are still enthusiastic about colonialist ideas. If this is their reason for opposing the nationalization of the Suez Canal, then outside of the so-called "undeveloped countries," there exists something that should be called "undeveloped thinking."

This morning, a grand ceremony was held in front of the Independence Palace in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of Indonesia's independence. President Sukarno delivered a speech at the meeting.

Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, also attended today's National Day ceremony. She sat on the rostrum to the left of President Sukarno and Vice President Hatta.

Sukarno reiterated his government's appeal to Britain, the United States, and France: stop military preparations and do not attempt to resolve the Suez Canal crisis by military means, but seek a peaceful solution in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Sukarno said that Indonesia's participation in the London conference on the canal issue "is to defend Egypt's sovereignty and world peace."

He believes that the Suez Canal issue is not just a problem related to Egypt alone, but a problem related to all colonies and newly independent countries. Sukarno said: "If I were to decide, I would convene a second Asian-African conference to discuss this issue."

He emphasized that Indonesia is "a friend of Egypt, and we will continue to fight colonialism by all means and on every world platform."

We are not neutral between freedom and colonialism

Speaking generally about world politics, Sukarno said that the independent policies pursued by many countries, including Indonesia, are often seen as something "antagonistic," but this policy has proven to be in line with the ideal of peace. He said, "The world is not only represented by Moscow and Washington, as if they are the only two major poles of world politics. There are also new poles in world politics such as Cairo, New Delhi, and Jakarta.

When clarifying Indonesia's foreign policy, President Sukarno said, "We are not neutral between right and wrong, and between freedom and colonialism. We are absolutely not neutral on independence. We are not without principles, because we have our Five Principles. I don't know why the policy embodied in the Five Principles is immoral. If someone does not appreciate this moral value, then I don't know what morality actually is."

He also said that, just as in the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, Indonesia cannot take a neutral stance on the current Suez Canal crisis. Sukarno said, "I call the world's attention to not creating another mistake that could ignite a new war."

Let the people of the world drive out the demons of the atomic age

When he mentioned the bright prospects of the current atomic age, he believed that one condition for utilizing this era is "an atomic revolution that combines spiritual revolution and moral revolution, focusing on peace instead of war, and striving for mutual trust instead of being enthusiastic about mutual suspicion. If this is not the case, the whole world will suffer a great disaster. We may be fortunate that this destruction has not yet arrived, but it may happen tomorrow. Therefore, let the people of the world develop high morality to drive out the demons of this atomic age!"

Military alliances are a practice that leads to conflict and war

Sukarno condemned military alliances, believing that it is a practice that may eventually lead to conflict and ultimately cause war. He said, "The intention of carrying out these military alliances will not be equal to the possible consequences caused by the military alliances."

He emphasized that international relations are human relations. "Humans are living animals, and they have this nature: if a group of people conclude an armed alliance, another group of people may rise up and imitate them. In this way, an arms race is created, thereby placing them in a position of face-to-face challenge. This challenge not only involves these two groups of people, but may also trigger the unrestrained nature of mankind to burn down the whole world." Sukarno called on the world's leaders to "engage in some reflection and cultivate morality, so that they will not worship weapons, power, and mortals, but serve the Creator."

The Netherlands must stop its colonial rule over West Irian

Speaking of Indonesia's relations with the Netherlands, President Sukarno said that Indonesia canceled its debt to the Netherlands because this debt was used to wage war against the Republic. He said that due to the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement, Indonesia achieved 100% freedom and independent status embodied in the 1945 Declaration of Independence.

He reiterated that West Irian is still under the colonial control of the Netherlands, which is detrimental to Indonesia's national prestige, "because as long as the situation continues like this, we feel unsafe."

Speaking of the establishment of the West Irian Provincial Government, Sukarno said that part of West Irian is already under the de facto jurisdiction of Indonesia, while other regions are still under Dutch imperialist rule.

Revisiting the debt issue, the Indonesian President explained, "We canceled these debts. But who originally owed these debts? When the Netherlands recognized our sovereignty in 1949, the safe left to us was not filled with coins and gold, but with payment vouchers and bills amounting to billions of guilders. According to the Round Table Conference Agreement, we needed to pay them money that would take several generations to pay off." Sukarno said that Indonesia had been faithfully repaying its debt to the Netherlands for the past six years. "We did not fully pay attention to the conditions imposed on us when we signed the Round Table Conference Agreement. We were not even able to clearly consider the impact of the Round Table Conference Agreement itself.

Sukarno said: "We finally realized that not all debts should be added to us." He also said: "In fact, Indonesia does not owe the Netherlands money, because most of the debt was used to wage war against us, and only a negligible part was used for construction purposes." The President further condemned the Netherlands' policy: on the one hand, wanting to be friends with Indonesia, but on the other hand, harming Indonesian feelings. He said: "If they want to maintain good relations with us, they should stop treating part of our territory as a colony. The Dutch have not seen that we are able to pay generous dividends for their investments in our country. Despite this, they may continue to fool us, and we must continue to go our own way. The insults and slander they have made against us will never affect our position."

Implementing national unity will bring a good climate for national construction

Sukarno reviewed the five tasks he put forward to the Indonesian people on last year's National Day: strengthen national unity, suppress armed rebels who disrupt public order, redouble efforts in construction, continue to fight for the recovery of West Irian, and hold general elections. He pointed out that, apart from the task of holding general elections which has been successfully completed, the other four tasks have not yet been completed; and the remaining four unfulfilled tasks revolve around a central task, which is construction.

He said that after the general election, Indonesia has laid a more solid foundation for the future development of a more complete democratic life. The abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement means that we have restored our country to the position declared in the August Revolution Declaration of 1945: independence, with full sovereignty, without any traces of subordination to any other country that impairs sovereignty. We have reached an investment stage, which refers to the broadest sense of investment for future construction. We must implement national unity, because national unity will bring a good climate for investment and construction. In order to achieve this good climate: one of the things to do is to have a perfect relationship between the parties.

Sukarno pointed out that there are still many things hindering unity: the relationship between the central and rural areas is not what it should be; the armed bandits who disrupt public order have not been completely eliminated; the Dutch economic dominance has not been eliminated; and the colonial imperialist rule over West Irian has not ended. Sukarno once again called on the armed bandits still in the forests to come out and restore normal life.

### 在庆祝印度尼西亚国庆纪念会上  苏加诺呼吁西方不要武装干涉埃及  强调印度尼西亚参加伦敦会议是去保卫埃及主权和世界和平

    在庆祝印度尼西亚国庆纪念会上
    苏加诺呼吁西方不要武装干涉埃及
    强调印度尼西亚参加伦敦会议是去保卫埃及主权和世界和平
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天说，对于那些由于埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有而想蹂躏埃及主权的国家，亚非国家应该宣布：“不许干涉埃及”！
    他指出，那些对埃及是否有能力保证苏彝士运河航行自由表示怀疑的人，仍然热中于殖民主义思想。如果这就是他们反对苏彝士运河国有化的理由，那么在所谓“不发达的国家”之外，还存在着一种应该称为“不发达的思想”的东西。
    今天上午，在印度尼西亚首都雅加达的独立宫前面，举行了庆祝印度尼西亚独立十一周年的盛大典礼。苏加诺总统在大会上发表了演说。
    中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄也出席了今天的国庆典礼。她坐在主席台上苏加诺总统和哈达副总统的左边。
    苏加诺重申他的政府对英国、美国和法国的呼吁：停止军事准备，不要企图用军事办法来解决苏彝士运河危机，而要按照联合国宪章设法和平解决。苏加诺说，印度尼西亚参加关于运河问题的伦敦会议“是去保卫埃及主权和世界和平的”。
    他认为，苏彝士运河问题不是一个单单和埃及有关的问题，而是同一切殖民地和新独立国家有关的问题。苏加诺说：“要是让我来决定的话，我就会召开第二次亚非会议来讨论这个问题”。
    他强调指出，印度尼西亚是“埃及的朋友，我们将继续用一切办法和在每一个世界讲台上同殖民主义进行斗争”。
    在自由和殖民主义之间我们不是中立的
    在一般地谈到世界政治的时候，苏加诺说，许多国家，包括印度尼西亚在内，执行的独立政策常常被人看作某种“搞对立的”东西，但是这种政策已经证明是符合和平的理想的。他说，“世界不光是由莫斯科和华盛顿代表的，好像只有它们才是世界政治的两大极，世界政治中还有开罗、新德里和雅加达这样一些新的极。
    苏加诺总统在澄清印度尼西亚的外交政策的时候说，“在是非之间和在自由与殖民主义之间，我们不是中立的，在独立方面，我们绝对不是中立的。我们不是没有原则的，因为我们有我们的五基，我不知道为什么体现在五基中的政策是不道德的，如果有人并不欣赏这种道德价值，那么我不知道实际上什么是道德。”
    他又说，就像在朝鲜问题和印度支那问题上一样，印度尼西亚也不可能在目前的苏彝士运河危机问题上采取中立态度。苏加诺说，“我提请全世界注意不要再次造成可能燃起新的战火的错误。”
    让全世界人民来驱除原子时代的恶魔
    他提到了当前原子时代的光明前景时认为，利用这个时代的一个条件就是“一个结合着精神革命和道德革命的原子革命，不着眼于战争而着眼和平，不热中于互相猜忌，而是力求互相信任。如果不这样的话，全世界将遭受大难。我们也许可以庆幸，这种毁灭还没有到来，但是这可能在明天发生。因此，让全世界人民发展高度的道德来驱除这个原子时代的恶魔吧！”
    军事联盟是导致冲突和战争的做法
    苏加诺谴责军事联盟，认为它是一种可能终于导致冲突和最后引起战争的做法。他说，“进行这些军事联盟的用意是不会等于军事联盟的可能引起的后果的”。
    他着重指出，国际关系是人的关系，“人是活的动物，它具有这种本性：如果一群人缔结武装联盟，另一群人可能起而仿效，这样，就造成军备竞赛，从而使他们处在面对面挑战的地位。这种挑战不仅牵涉到这两群人，而且可能触发人类不羁的本性来烧毁全世界。”苏加诺呼吁全世界的领袖们“进行一些反省和培养道德，这使他们不会膜拜武器、力量和凡人，而是侍奉造物主。”
    荷兰必须停止对西伊里安的殖民统治
    谈到印度尼西亚同荷兰的关系，苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚取消它对荷兰的债务是因为这种债款被用来对共和国进行战争。他说，由于废除了圆桌会议协定，印度尼西亚实现了1945年独立宣言中所体现的100％的自由和独立的地位。
    他重申，西伊里安还在荷兰的殖民主义控制下，这有损印度尼西亚的国家威信，“因为只要情况继续这样下去，我们就觉得不安全”。
    谈到成立西伊里安省政府问题，苏加诺说，西伊里安的一部分已经在印度尼西亚的事实上的管辖下，其他地区仍旧在荷兰帝国主义统治下。
    重新谈到债务问题时，印度尼西亚总统解释说，“我们取消了这些债款。但是这些债原来是谁负的呢？1949年荷兰承认我们的主权的时候，留给我们的保险箱里不是装满了钱币和黄金，而是装满了为数达到几十亿荷兰盾的付款凭单和账单。根据圆桌会议协定，我们需要付给他们需要好几代来付清的钱。”苏加诺说，过去六年里面印度尼西亚一直在忠实地偿付对荷兰的债务。“我们没有充分注意到在我们签订圆桌会议协定的时候强加于我们的条件。我们甚至没有能够清楚地考虑一下圆桌会议协定本身的影响。
    苏加诺说：“我们终于认识到不是所有的债款都应该加在我们的身上的。”他又说：“实际上，印度尼西亚已经不欠荷兰钱了，因为大部分债款是被用来对我们进行战争的，而只有微不足道的一部分用于建设目的。”这位总统进一步谴责荷兰的这种政策：一方面想同印度尼西亚交朋友，可是另方面却在损害印度尼西亚的感情。他说：“如果他们希望同我们保持良好关系的话，他们就应该停止把我们的领土的一部分当作殖民地。荷兰人没有看到，我们对于他们在我国的投资，是能够付给优厚的红利的。尽管这样，他们却可能继续愚弄我们，我们必须继续走我们自己的路。他们对我们进行的欺辱和诽谤言论绝不会影响我们的立场。”
    实行全国团结将为国家建设带来好气候
    苏加诺回顾了他在去年国庆日向印度尼西亚人民所提出的五项任务：加强全国团结、镇压扰乱治安的武装叛乱分子、加倍努力进行建设、继续为收复西伊里安而斗争、举行普选。他指出，除举行普选一项任务已经完满完成以外，其他四项任务都还没有完成；而剩下的未完成的四项任务又围绕着一个中心任务，这就是进行建设。
    他说，在普选以后，印度尼西亚已经为将来发展更加完全的民主生活打下了更坚实的基础。废除圆桌会议协定意味着我们已经使我们的国家恢复到1945年8月革命宣言所宣布的那种地位：独立，有充分的主权，没有任何有损主权的附属任何其他国家的痕迹。我们已经到达一个投资的阶段，这里指的是为了将来的建设而进行投资的最广义的说法。我们必须实行全国团结，因为全国团结将会为投资和建设带来良好气候。为了取得这种良好气候：要做的事情之一就是要使各党派之间有完满的关系。
    苏加诺指出，现在还有许多事情妨碍着团结：中央和乡村地区的关系还不是应该有的那样；扰乱治安的武装匪帮还没有完全肃清；荷兰的经济支配地位还没有消除；对西伊里安的殖民帝国主义统治还没有结束。苏加诺再度号召还在森林中的武装匪徒出来恢复正常生活。
