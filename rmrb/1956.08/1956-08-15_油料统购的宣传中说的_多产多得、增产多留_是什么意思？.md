Answering Readers' Questions

    The current season is the growth and development season for oil crops such as peanuts and sesame. To encourage farmers to strengthen field management and produce more oil for the country and themselves, it is very important to publicize the "Produce More, Get More; Increase Production, Keep More" policy in terms of unified purchase of oil crops to the masses. What are the specific contents of this policy? Some people are not very clear about it. Now, according to readers' requests, the answers are as follows:

    Although "Produce More, Get More" and "Increase Production, Keep More" are a complete policy, they have different contents.

    "Produce More, Get More" means that when the state makes a unified purchase of oil crops, agricultural cooperatives or farmers who produce oil crops are allowed to keep the oil crops needed for seeds and consumption next year (kept according to the prescribed quota), and then sell a portion of the remaining oil crops to the state in accordance with state regulations. In this way, agricultural cooperatives or farmers who produce more oil crops will get more oil than agricultural cooperatives or farmers who produce less oil. For example: If an agricultural cooperative produces 15,000 jin of peanut kernels this year, plans to plant 100 mu next year, needs 2,000 jin of seeds, and the entire cooperative has 200 people, with a prescribed oil consumption quota of 13 jin per person, the amount to be retained for self-use should be 2,600 jin; the remaining 10,400 jin of oil crops, the state stipulates that 95% will be subject to unified purchase, then, in addition to the seeds and oil for self-use, this cooperative can also get 520 jin of oil. Another cooperative, with the same population, seed requirements, and self-use oil needs as the previous one, if the output is 5,000 jin less, then the extra oil it gets will only be 270 jin, which is 250 jin less than the previous cooperative.

    "Increase Production, Keep More" means that the state will not purchase or will purchase a portion of the part of the production unit that plants oil crops that exceeds the planned production due to increased yield per unit area. Suppose a cooperative plants 100 mu of peanuts this year, with a planned yield of 200 jin (raw kernels) per mu. In actual harvest, it yields 215 jin per mu, which is 15 jin more than the original plan. The state stipulates that the increased part will not be subject to unified purchase in principle and will be entirely at the disposal of the producers. In this way, this cooperative can keep an extra 1,500 jin of peanut kernels. This is just in general terms. If some areas suffer disaster and reduce production, the state may appropriately increase purchases in areas that have not been affected by the disaster to support areas that have suffered disaster and reduced production. However, according to regulations, this increased purchase cannot exceed 40%-50% of the total increased production. In this way, even if the state increases the purchase of the over-planned increased production of increased production units, the oil retained by the over-planned increased production units is still relatively large.

    According to our understanding, the methods of implementing the "Produce More, Get More; Increase Production, Keep More" policy vary from place to place. Some are calculated separately as in the above examples; others, due to weak work foundations, find it difficult to strictly distinguish, so they combine the calculations of "Produce More, Get More; Increase Production, Keep More". Although combined calculation is not as accurate as separate calculation, it can basically reflect this policy. This refers to areas with oil processing conditions. In individual areas without processing conditions, if machinery is used for unified purchase according to the prescribed ratio, farmers will waste the remaining oil because they cannot process it, which is not good for the country and the farmers. In some areas, in addition to the seeds for self-use, the state purchases all the oil produced by farmers, and then provides appropriate preferential treatment to oil-producing households in terms of supply. This is also in line with the principle of "Produce More, Get More; Increase Production, Keep More".

    The above practices refer to concentrated oil-producing areas. In scattered oil-producing areas, because production is sporadic and most are self-sufficient households, it is not necessary to adopt the same unified purchase method as concentrated production areas. In these areas, we can only strengthen administrative management and conduct market purchases.

### 油料统购的宣传中说的“多产多得、增产多留”是什么意思？

专栏：答读者问

    油料统购的宣传中说的“多产多得、增产多留”是什么意思？
    目前正是花生、芝麻等油料作物生长发育的季节。为了鼓励农民加强田间管理，为国家和自己生产更多的油料，很需要向群众宣传油料统购方面“多产多得、增产多留”的政策。这项政策的具体内容是什么？有些人还不十分了解。现在，根据读者的要求，解答如下：
    “多产多得”和“增产多留”虽然是一个完整的政策，但是它们却具有不同的内容。
    “多产多得”，就是国家统购油料的时候，允许生产油料的农业合作社或农户留下明年所需要的种子和食用的油料（按规定的定额留），然后再按国家的规定，把剩余的油料卖给国家一部分。这样，生产油料多的农业合作社或农户，就比生产油料少的农业合作社或农户得到的油料多。比如：某一个农业合作社今年产花生仁一万五千斤，明年计划种一百亩，需要种子二千斤，全社共有二百口人，每人规定用油定额为十三斤，应留自用量为二千六百斤；剩余的油料一万零四百斤，国家规定按95％进行统购，那末，这个社除了留下的种子和自用的油料外，还可多得五百二十斤油料。另一个人口、需要种子和自用油料的数量都和前一个一样的社，如果产量少了五千斤，那末，它多得的油料就只有二百七十斤，比前一个社少二百五十斤。
    “增产多留”，就是国家对种植油料的生产单位，由于提高单位产量而超计划生产的部分不收购或酌量收购一部分。假定某个社，今年种花生一百亩，每亩计划产量二百斤（生仁），实际收获时，每亩215斤，比原计划多产十五斤。国家规定对增产部分，原则上不统购，全部归生产者支配。这样，这个社就可以多留一千五百斤花生仁了。这只是就一般情况而说的，如果某些地区受灾减产，国家可以在没有受灾的地区，酌情增购一些，支援受灾减产的地区。不过，这种增购的部分，按规定最多不能超过增产总量的40％—50％。这样，即使国家增购了增产单位的超计划增产的部分油料，超计划增产单位所留的油料还是比较多的。
    根据我们的了解，各地贯彻“多产多得，增产多留”政策的方法上，各有不同，有的是如上述例子分别计算；有的由于工作基础薄弱，严格区分确有困难，便把“多产多得，增产多留”合并计算。合并计算虽然不如分别计算准确，但是也可以基本上体现这个政策。这都是指有油料加工条件的地区而说的。在个别没有加工条件的地区，如果机械按规定比例统购，农民将由于无法处理留下的油料而造成浪费，这对国家和农民都是不利的。有些地区，除了留用的种子以外。国家把农民生产的油料全部统购进来，然后再在供应上，给产油料户适当的优待。这样做，也是符合“多产多得，增产多留”的原则的。
    上面的做法，是指油料集中产区说的。在油料分散产区，因为生产零星，而且多数是自给户，所以没有必要采取和集中产区相同的统购办法。对这类地区，只能加强行政管理，进行市场收购。
