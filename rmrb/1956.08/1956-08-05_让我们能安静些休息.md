    Let Us Have Some Quiet Rest
    A section of the Ningwu Railway passes through the urban area of Nanjing. Trains come and go about sixteen times a day and night, and they blow their whistles for a long time when passing through the urban area. The families of cadres and workers living near the railway in the Hubei Road area are often awakened several times at night by the long whistles. Some sick children cry even more after being awakened by the train's strange cries. If this situation continues for a long time, it will seriously affect the health of residents. It is hoped that relevant departments will take effective measures to ensure that residents in the city can get a quiet rest.

    让我们能安静些休息
    宁芜铁路有一段由南京市区穿过，一昼夜火车来去约十六次，并且在通过市区时长鸣汽笛，住在铁路附近湖北路一带的机关干部和职工家属，晚间常常几次被长鸣的汽笛声惊醒，有些有病的儿童被火车的怪叫声惊醒后，更加哭闹不已。这种情况如果长期下去，将会严重地影响居民的健康。希望有关部门采取有效措施，保证市内居民能够得到安静的休息。　　　　石溪
