Voices of the Masses

	Do Not Disturb the Sanatorium's Peace
	I am recuperating at the Asian Students' Sanatorium. Recently, this peaceful sanatorium has become disturbed. Our neighbor, the Construction Workers' Sanatorium, plays its loudspeakers loudly every day from dawn until dark. We are sometimes awakened from a sound sleep and cannot rest peacefully during the day. I hope the Construction Workers' Sanatorium will quickly stop broadcasting and let us rest in peace!

	The Official Seal on Dance Tickets
	Recently, I found a dance ticket in the dormitory of the Northeastern Forest Railway Engineering Subdivision in Chengde City. The issuing authority is the Chengde Prefecture Public Security Office, and the ticket is stamped with the office's red official seal. I believe that official seals should only be used on official documents. For recreational evenings, a special stamp should be used on the tickets. Misuse of official seals can easily create opportunities for bad elements. I hope all organizations will pay attention.

    不要破坏疗养院的安静
    我住在亚洲学生疗养院休养，近来，这个安静的疗养院变得不安静了。我们的邻居，建筑工人疗养院每天从破晓时起，就大放广播器，直到天黑还不停止。我们有时被从酣睡中惊醒，白天也不能安静地休息。希望建筑工人疗养院，赶快停止广播，让我们安静的休养吧！

    舞票上的公章
    最近，我在承德市东北森林铁路工程分区的机关宿舍里，拾到一张舞票。发票机关是承德专署公安处，票面上并盖有该处的红色公章。我认为，机关公章只能在机关正式行文时用，举行文娱晚会可在票面上盖一个专用图章。滥用机关公章，易给坏分子造成可乘之机，希望各机关注意。　汪广泉
