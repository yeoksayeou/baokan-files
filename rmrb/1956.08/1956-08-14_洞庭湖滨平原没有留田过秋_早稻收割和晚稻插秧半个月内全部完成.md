Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 13th. The more than 5 million mu of double-cropping rice on the famous grain-producing Dongting Lake Plain in Hunan Province have had their early rice harvest and late rice transplanting completed in the past fifteen days, without leaving any fields fallow in autumn. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in local history.

This year, the double-cropping rice planting area on the Dongting Lake Plain has expanded more than twofold compared to last year. According to preliminary estimates from the Changde Special District agricultural department, the unit yield of early rice in various counties generally reached around 450 jin per mu, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. The total early rice output of the entire special district increased by approximately 1.1 billion jin compared to last year. Records of thousand-jin mu and large-scale high yields have appeared in many places. Some low-lying lake fields that had never produced grain before have also had a bumper harvest this year. The Anfu Agricultural Cooperative in Nanxian harvested an average of 678.5 jin per mu from its 2,253 mu of early rice, with 58 mu averaging 950 jin per mu. The Dongbocheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County also created the highest early rice yield record in the province of 1,335 jin per mu.

Now, the farmers on the plain are preparing to harvest mid-season rice and are strengthening field management work such as cultivating and applying fertilizer to late rice in order to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice.

    洞庭湖滨平原没有留田过秋
    早稻收割和晚稻插秧半个月内全部完成
    新华社长沙13日电　著名的产粮区湖南省洞庭湖滨平原五百多万亩双季稻，早稻收割和晚稻插秧已经在过去十五天内全部完成，没有留田过秋。这是当地历史上没有过的现象。
    今年洞庭湖滨平原的双季稻种植面积，比去年扩大了两倍多。据常德专区农业部门初步估算，各县早稻的单位面积产量一般达到四百五十斤左右，比去年增产一成多。全专区早稻总产量约比去年增加十一亿多斤。许多地方出现了千斤亩和大面积丰产的纪录。有些从来没有收过粮食的低洼湖田，今年也丰收了。南县安福农业社的2，253亩早稻，平均每亩收678.5斤；其中有五十八亩平均每亩达九百五十斤。沅江县东波城农业社还创造了每亩1，335斤的全省早稻最高产量的纪录。
    现在平原上的农民正在准备收割中稻，并且对晚稻加强中耕、追肥等田间管理工作，以争取晚稻丰收。
