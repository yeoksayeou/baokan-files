Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: At the opening of the fourth session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress today, Deputy Mayor Xue Zizheng said that the capital's appearance has undergone great changes. Over the past seven years, the government has used an average of 25.54% of the annual municipal financial budget to improve the capital's water supply, drainage, roads, bridges, public transportation, parks, and greening facilities.

He said that the city's population using tap water has reached more than 2.18 million, equivalent to 66% of the city's population. This is an increase of two and a half times compared to the early days of liberation. In the urban area, 97.6% of the population uses tap water, and the per capita daily water consumption has also increased from 30.6 liters in the early days of liberation to 52 liters. Over the past seven years, a total of more than 280 kilometers of old sewers have been repaired, 289 kilometers of new sewers have been built, and 682 kilometers of various roads have been constructed.

In the rapidly developing municipal construction, the stinky ponds where reeds, garbage, and excrement used to gather—Taoranting and Longtan—have now become beautiful parks. More than 90,000 trees have been newly planted along roads and rivers, and famous parks such as Beihai, Zhongshan, Summer Palace, and Temple of Heaven have been greatly improved. The original Western Suburbs Park has also developed into the largest zoo in the country.

The city's public transportation operating routes are now more than 400 kilometers, an increase of 4.6 times compared to seven years ago. Calculated by the city's permanent resident population, the average number of times each person uses public transportation vehicles per year has also increased by 4.7 times compared to seven years ago. The average daily number of passengers is currently 960,000.

This year's municipal construction expenditure accounts for 29% of the total municipal financial expenditure, an increase of 0.46% compared to 1955. This year, there are also plans to build 94 kilometers of roads. In order to solve the water source problem for industrial and people's livelihood water use, the initial phase of the Yongding River water diversion project will also be completed this year. 28.83 kilometers of new sewers will be built. Ten regional small parks will be expanded. This year, trees will also be planted along 50 kilometers of sidewalks.

Xue Zizheng discussed in detail the shortcomings of the current municipal construction, such as the lack of planning and foresight, and proposed specific solutions. He particularly reviewed the shortcomings of the past few years in municipal construction, such as the lack of a strong mass viewpoint and insufficient concern for the immediate interests of the masses. He said that the expansion and renovation of Beijing must be carried out gradually, so there will inevitably be some street widenings, some demolition of private houses, and some residents will have to be relocated. However, in planning and design, attention must be paid to minimizing the occupation of farmland and demolition of private houses. When it is really unavoidable, all preparations must be made properly, planned, and responsibly to solve the difficulties of the relocated households.

At today's meeting, Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Cheng Hongyi also gave reports on "Beijing's 1955 Financial Revenue and Expenditure Final Accounts and 1956 Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget" and "Improving Beijing's Commercial Work," respectively.

The meeting is expected to close on August 13.

    北京市人民代表大会会议开幕
    新华社8日讯　在今天开幕的北京市第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，副市长薛子正说，首都面貌已有很大改变，七年来政府平均用了占每年市财政预算的25.54％的费用，来改善首都供水、排水、道路桥梁、公共交通、园林绿化等设施。
    他说，目前全市饮用自来水的人口已达218万多人，相当于全市人口66％，比解放初期用水人口增加了两倍半，城区饮用自来水人口已达97.6％，每人每日用水量也由解放初期三十点六公升增加到五十二公升。七年来共修复了旧下水道二百八十多公里，新建下水道289公里，修筑各种道路682公里。
    在迅速发展的市政建设中，原来是苇塘、垃圾粪便汇集的臭水坑——陶然亭、龙潭，现在都已变成了美丽的公园。道路和河道旁新植了九万多株树，著名的北海、中山、颐和园、天坛等公园，都有了很大改善。原来的西郊公园也发展成为全国最大的动物园。
    市内公共交通营业路线已有四百多公里，比七年前增加了四点六倍，按城市长住人口计算，平均每人每年利用公共交通车辆次数也比七年前增加了四点七倍。乘客人数目前平均每天九十六万人次。
    今年市政建设支出占市财政支出总额的29％，可比1955年增加0.46％。今年还计划修建道路九十四公里。为了解决工业和人民生活用水的水源，永定河引水工程也将在今年完成初期工程。新建下水道二十八点八三公里。扩充区域性小型公园十处。今年还将在五十公里的行人道旁增植一些树。
    薛子正详细谈到了目前市政建设上存在的缺乏计划性和预见性的缺点，并提出了具体的解决办法。他特别检讨了以往几年来在市政建设中群众观点不强，对群众切身利益关心不够的缺点。他说，北京城市的扩建改建是要逐步进行的，因而必会有一些街道展宽，有一部分民房拆除，一部分住户要迁移。但在规划设计时必须注意尽量少占农田，少拆民房，实在不可避免时，也必须妥善地、有计划地负责地做好一切准备工作，解决被迁户的困难。
    在今天会议上副市长张友渔、程宏毅还分别作了“北京市1955年财政收支决算和1956年财政收支预算”，“改进北京市的商业工作”两个报告。
    这次会议预计在八月十三日闭幕。
