Xinhua News Agency, London, August 16th (TASS): Shepilov's speech at the Suez Canal issue conference on August 16th. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen!

Before the delegations of many countries who have come to London begin to exchange views on the substance of measures to ensure freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to offer some opinions on the organization of the conference and its working procedures.

The Soviet government, which has consistently and resolutely striven for further relaxation of international tensions, including in the Near and Middle East, has agreed to participate in this conference in line with its unwavering policy of striving for peace and resolving international disputes and conflicts through peaceful means through consultation.

We are here with only one purpose: to work with representatives of other countries to try to find a peaceful solution to the acute issues that have attracted widespread attention.

The Soviet delegation will present the Soviet government's attitude towards the Suez Canal issue in detail at the appropriate time. Now I will only briefly offer some comments.

The Soviet government pointed out in its statement of August 9, 1956, on the Suez Canal issue that convening a conference in this way seriously undermines the recognized principles of international law regarding the holding of international conferences.

The international navigation regime for the Suez Canal was established by the 1888 Constantinople Convention. This convention stipulates that if issues arise regarding freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, the member states of the convention will first conduct consultations.

However, this current conference is being convened on the basis of decisions made by only two members of the 1888 Convention – Britain and France – and the United States, which is not a member of the convention. The conveners of this conference did not consult with the other members of the 1888 Convention, let alone other countries related to canal navigation. Regrettably, this decision was made without prior consultation with the Egyptian government. Although, as everyone knows, the Suez Canal passes through Egyptian territory and is within Egypt's sovereignty.

As for the composition of the conference, it must first be pointed out that among the countries invited, many countries that participated in the 1888 Convention were not invited.

In fact, among the countries that participated in this convention were Austria-Hungary and Germany. As everyone knows, the legal successors to Austria-Hungary are Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. However, none of these countries were invited to participate in the conference.

Some insist that Hungary and Austria have relinquished the rights and bases of rights arising from the existence of the then Austro-Hungarian Empire. This statement does not conform to reality. I ask everyone to study Article 217 of the Treaty of Trianon.

This clause lists the conventions concluded by the former Austro-Hungarian Empire that should continue to be adopted by Hungary. These conventions include the Suez Canal Convention concluded on October 29, 1888. Article 234 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain makes the same provisions for Austria. We also cannot fail to mention Czechoslovakia, which occupies a considerable part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Yugoslavia has officially declared that it legally inherited the rights of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aforementioned convention.

Only one part of Germany – the Federal Republic of Germany – was invited, while the other part of Germany – the German Democratic Republic – was not invited. This practice cannot be considered normal.

The absence of a large country like the People's Republic of China from the conference cannot but weaken the international prestige and weight of the conference.

There is no reason not to allow Arab countries to participate in discussions on the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. Their territories are adjacent to Egypt. Both politically and economically, they are deeply concerned that the Suez issue can be resolved correctly and that the canal can be kept open. However, these Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Morocco, and Tunisia were not invited to participate in the conference.

These maritime nations which extensively use the Suez Canal, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Burma, and Finland, were also not invited to participate in the conference.

To illustrate the issue, please allow me to cite some facts and figures. We wholeheartedly welcome the representatives of Ethiopia and Pakistan to participate in this conference, and we believe this is completely normal. In 1955, the total tonnage of Ethiopian ships passing through the Suez Canal was 26,324 tons, and the total tonnage of Pakistani ships was 150,466 tons. But on the other hand, why was Saudi Arabia, whose total tonnage of ships passing through the Suez Canal in 1955 was 382,957 tons, not invited? Why are there no representatives of Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia here? Please look at the tonnage of ships from these three countries passing through the Suez Canal in 1955: Poland – 836,427 tons, Yugoslavia – 180,380 tons, Czechoslovakia – 118,161 tons.

It can be seen from this that there is clearly an ulterior motive in determining the composition of the current conference, which is undeniable.

The British government's note of August 3, 1956, pointed out that two points were taken into account when deciding on the members of the conference: first, the participating countries of the 1888 Convention, and second, countries particularly related to the use of the canal. However, in practice, neither of these points was observed, thus arousing justifiable protests from many countries. For example, as everyone knows, Yugoslavia, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and other countries have issued corresponding statements.

According to the provisions of the 1888 Convention, it would have been more appropriate to choose Cairo as the venue for holding such a conference. Finally, the date of the conference was also determined without considering the opinions of the relevant countries.

Gentlemen, considering the above facts, it cannot but be considered that the convening of this conference in many respects seriously violates the legitimate rights of many sovereign countries; the method of convening this conference violates the interests and principles of international cooperation stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet government has timely drawn attention to this situation and put forward some suggestions which, if adopted, would have made the current conference more representative. We deeply regret that our efforts have not been supported by the British government.

The Soviet delegation cannot but point out the unhealthy nature of the atmosphere in which this conference was prepared. We are referring to those facts that violate the United Nations principles of peace, such as the imposition of economic sanctions, threats of force, military demonstrations, the calling up of reserve soldiers, and so on, by certain countries.

The ulterior motives in selecting the members of the conference, the failure to consult with the Egyptian government when convening the conference and the violation of the provisions of the 1888 Convention, the purposes and tasks of the conference actually put forward by the initiators of the conference in the form of an ultimatum (these purposes and tasks are incompatible with Egyptian national dignity and sovereignty), all this cannot but make Egypt refuse to participate in the conference.

Summarizing all of the above, the obvious conclusion is naturally drawn: it is very regrettable that this conference is not a fully representative conference. Therefore, under the current composition, the conference cannot practically solve the problem, and the practical solution can only be achieved with the consent of the relevant countries, including Egypt, the country that has jurisdiction over the Suez Canal.

However, the Soviet delegation not only does not want to complicate the work of the conference, but it will also take all possible measures to promote the tasks of the conference, because this conference can bring some benefits. In order for the conference to bring such benefits, its purposes and tasks and the procedures of the conference must be determined based on the actual situation. We believe that such a conference is the first step forward on the road of consultation, and we believe that all of us should try to find a solution to this issue that is of concern to many people today based on the exchange of views and consultations, and that this solution should be acceptable to Egypt and other relevant countries.

Ladies and gentlemen! There is no need to emphasize that, given the limited and preliminary nature of this conference, it would be inappropriate to complicate the work with some kind of voting procedure.

I request the esteemed representatives of the various countries gathered here not to focus on the procedural issues of the conference, but to focus on working together to prevent the situation in the Near East from continuing to intensify. For a conference like ours, what is decisive is to seek a way to resolve the Suez issue that everyone agrees on.

Efforts should be made to ensure that this meeting of representatives of various countries achieves a consensus on preparing an international conference or other international procedures in order to discuss the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal on the basis of respecting Egyptian sovereignty.

The Soviet government believes that only by adopting such an attitude towards the issue of navigation in the Suez Canal will it be in line with the task of further easing international tensions, and will it be able to demonstrate the victory of the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter.

Ladies and gentlemen! The Soviet Union has no special interests in the Near East and Middle East. The Soviet Union does not enjoy and does not demand a special rights and privileged position in any country in the Arab East. What we hope for, and what we are striving for now and in the future, is only one goal, that is, to make the Near East and Middle East a region of lasting peace, progress of all peoples, and effective international cooperation.

    谢皮洛夫在苏彝士运河问题会议上发言
    召开伦敦会议严重破坏国际法原则
    希望各国通过交换意见找出能为埃及及其他有关国家接受的解决办法
    新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦十六日电：谢皮洛夫八月十六日在苏彝士运河问题会议上的发言。主席先生，各位先生！
    在目前来到伦敦的许多国家的代表团将就保证苏彝士运河航行自由措施问题的实质交换意见之前，苏联代表团认为有必要对组织会议和会议工作程序提出一些意见。
    一贯坚决地争取进一步缓和包括中近东地区在内的国际紧张局势的苏联政府，本着争取和平和通过协商而用和平方法解决国际争端和冲突的不变政策，同意参加这次会议。
    我们到这里只有一个目的：同其他国家代表共同试图找寻和平解决引起普遍注意的尖锐问题的道路。
    苏联代表团在适当的时候将详尽地陈述苏联政府对苏彝士运河问题的态度。现在我只简短地谈一些意见。
    苏联政府在1956年8月9日关于苏彝士运河问题的声明中已经指出，召开现在这样一次会议，是严重破坏公认的国际法关于举行国际会议的原则的。
    苏彝士运河的国际通航制度是1888年君士坦丁堡公约确定的。这个公约规定，如果发生有关苏彝士运河航行自由的问题，公约成员国将首先进行磋商。
    但是，目前的这一会议，是在只有两个1888年公约成员国——英国和法国以及非公约成员国的美国的决定的基础上召开的。这次会议的召开国没有跟1888年公约的其他成员国，更不用说没有跟同运河航行有关的其他国家，进行磋商。遗憾的是，这一决定是在事先没有同埃及政府磋商的情况下作出的。虽然，大家知道，苏彝士运河通过埃及的领土，是在埃及的主权范围之内的。
    至于谈到会议的成员，那么首先必须指出在被邀请的国家中没有邀请许多参加1888年公约的国家。
    实际上，在参加这一公约的国家中有奥匈帝国和德国。大家知道，奥匈帝国的法律继承者是奥地利、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫。但是，这次国家中没有一个国家被邀请参加会议。
    有人硬说，匈牙利和奥地利已经放弃当时奥匈帝国的存在所产生的权利和权利根据。这种说法是不符合实际情况的。我请大家研究一下特里阿农和约第二百一十七条。
    这项条款列举了前奥匈帝国缔结的公约，这些公约应当继续为匈牙利采用。这些公约中包括1888年10月29日缔结的苏彝士运河公约。圣日曼和约的第二百三十四条对奥地利也作了同样的规定。我们还不能不提到占有前奥匈帝国相当大一部分领土的捷克斯洛伐克。南斯拉夫已经正式声明，它合法地继承了前奥匈帝国在上述公约中的权利。
    对德国只邀请了德国的一部分——德意志联邦共和国，而没有邀请德国的另一部分——德意志民主共和国。这种做法不能认为是正常的。
    中华人民共和国这样一个大国没有出席会议，这就不能不削弱这次会议的国际威信和分量。
    没有任何理由不让阿拉伯国家参加讨论苏彝士运河航行自由问题的会议。它们的领土同埃及接邻。不论从政治上和经济上，它们都深切关心苏彝士问题能得到正确的解决，运河能够畅通。但是，叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、约旦、苏丹、利比亚、也门、摩洛哥和突尼斯这些阿拉伯国家并没有被邀请参加会议。
    波兰、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、缅甸和芬兰这些广泛使用苏彝士运河的海运国家也没有被邀请参加会议。
    为了说明问题请允许我引用一些事实和数字。我们衷心欢迎埃塞俄比亚和巴基斯坦的代表参加这一会议，我们认为这是完全正常的。1955年通过苏彝士运河的埃塞俄比亚船只的总吨数为两万六千三百二十四吨，巴基斯坦船只的总吨数为一十五万零四百六十六吨。但是另一方面，1955年通过苏彝士运河的船只的总吨数有三十八万两千九百五十七吨的沙特阿拉伯为什么没有被邀请呢。在这里为什么没有波兰、南斯拉夫和捷克斯洛伐克的代表。请看看1955年这三个国家的通过苏彝士运河船只的吨数：波兰——八十三万六千四百二十七吨，南斯拉夫——一十八万零三百八十吨，捷克斯洛伐克——一十一万八千一百六十一吨。
    由此可见，在确定目前会议成员的时候显然别有用心，这是无可争辩的。
    英国政府1956年8月3日的照会指出，在决定会议成员的问题的时候注意到两点：第一是1888年公约的参加国，第二是同使用运河特别有关的国家。但是实际上，这两点都没有被遵守，因而引起了许多国家的有理由的抗议。例如，大家都知道，南斯拉夫、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰和其他国家都发表了相应的声明。
    根据1888年公约的条款，如果选择开罗作为举行这种会议的地点，那就更为正确。最后，会议召开的日期，也是没有考虑有关国家的意见就加以确定的。
    先生们，考虑到以上事实，不能不认为，这个会议的召开在很多地方严重破坏了许多自主国家的合法权利；召开这个会议的方法是违反联合国宪章规定的国际合作的利益和原则的。
    苏联政府曾经及时地提请注意这种情况，并且提出了一些建议，如果这些建议被采纳，将会使目前的会议具有代表性。我们深感遗憾的是，我们的努力并没有得到英国政府方面的支持。
    苏联代表团不能不指出进行筹备这次会议的气氛的不健康性质。我们指的是违反联合国和平原则的那些事实，如某些国家采取经济制裁、武力威胁、军事示威、征召后备役军人等等。
    选择会议成员时的别有用心、召开会议时没有同埃及政府磋商并且破坏1888年公约的条款、会议发起者实际上用最后通牒方式提出的会议目的和任务（这些目的和任务是同埃及的民族尊严和主权不相容的），这一切不能不使埃及拒绝参加会议。
    概括上述的一切，自然得出明显的结论：十分遗憾，本会议不是一个有充分代表性的会议。因此，在目前的成员情况下，会议不可能实际解决问题，要实际解决问题只有在各有关国家、包括管辖苏彝士运河的埃及这样国家的同意下才能做到。
    不过，苏联代表团不仅不愿使会议工作复杂化，并且它将采取一切可能的措施来促进会议的任务，因为这个会议可以带来某种益处。为了使会议能够带来这种益处，必须根据现实情况确定它的目的和任务以及会议程序。我们认为这样的会议是在协商道路上迈进的第一步，我们认为我们大家应当在交换意见和磋商的基础上试图找寻对现在许多人所关心的这个问题的解决办法，这种解决办法应当是埃及和其他有关国家所能接受的。
    各位先生！无需着重指出：鉴于这一会议的有限性和初步性质，用某种表决程序使工作复杂化将是不适当的。
    我请求聚集在这里的敬爱的各国代表们不要注重会议程序的问题，而着重于共同努力以制止近东的局势继续尖锐化。对我们这样的会议来说，具有决定意义的是寻求一个大家都同意的解决苏彝士问题的途径。
    应该努力做到，使各国代表的这次会见就筹备国际会议或者其他的国际程序以便在尊重埃及主权的基础上讨论苏彝士运河航行自由问题，取得一致的意见。
    苏联政府相信，只有对苏彝士运河航行问题抱着这样的态度，才符合进一步缓和国际紧张局势的任务，才能够表现出联合国宪章的崇高原则的胜利。
    各位先生！苏联在近东和中东地区没有任何特殊的利益。苏联在阿拉伯东方的任何一个国家里没有享有并且也不要求有特殊的权利和特权的地位。我们所希望的、我们现在和将来所努力的只有一个目标，那就是使近东和中东地区成为一个持久和平、各国人民进步和有效的国际合作的地区。
