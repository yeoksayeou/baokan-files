Xinhua News Agency, 12th - A warm national style and rich local color were the characteristics of the joint performance concert held in Beijing on the 11th and 12th of the First National Music Week.

Personnel from delegations from a total of fifteen provinces participated in this performance.

The concert featured folk song choruses and solos from various regions and ethnic groups; guzheng, flute, pipa, and yueqin solos; folk band ensembles with distinct styles from Fujian, Guangdong, Chaozhou, Zhejiang and other places; Qingchang excerpts from local operas such as Huai Opera and Xi Opera, as well as Quyi programs such as Sichuan Qingyin and Hubei Dagu.

At the concert, the audience cheered in unison for Zhao Songting of the Zhejiang delegation who performed a bamboo flute solo. Zhao Yuzhai (Liaoning delegation), who won praise at this year's "Prague Spring" International Music Festival, performed the guzheng solo "Celebrating a Bumper Harvest." The folk song chorus "Cui Deng Cui" performed by the Hubei delegation was the last program of the concert. After the song was finished, the audience was reluctant to leave and enthusiastically requested an encore.

Veteran musicians Man Qianzi (Guangxi delegation) and Lang Yuxiu (Sichuan delegation) also performed solos.
