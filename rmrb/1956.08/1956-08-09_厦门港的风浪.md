Xiamen Harbor's Winds and Waves
By Our Special Correspondent Yang Shuo

The lychees are ripe. This season isn't usually the typhoon season on the southeast coast, but you can still hear a sound like distant shouts. Suddenly, the emerald green sea turns yellow, rolling up countless snow-like crests. Then the lychee trees, longan trees, and other trees with shiny leaves begin to produce a chorus of warlike sounds.

To be honest, I originally thought that Xiamen, being on the front line of coastal defense, with Taiwan across the strait and the islands of Greater and Lesser Kinmen right under its nose, must be incredibly tense. But it's not. It's the front line, but not like the front line. It’s just like any other corner of the motherland, building its own picturesque life.

A mistake on the map should be corrected. According to maps, Xiamen is surrounded by sea, an island. But it's no longer an island; it's more like a peninsula. This miracle is due to a newly built sea dyke. I went to see it and stood there, unable to move. What an amazing creation! A dam more than two kilometers long, built entirely of white granite, cuts right through the turbulent harbor from north to south. The harbor is cut off, but Xiamen Island is connected to the mainland to the north.

At the southern end of the dyke is a pavilion, surrounded by eucalyptus, albizia, and acacia trees... each tree casting a cool shade. People crossing the dyke love to stop and rest in the pavilion. I climbed up to the pavilion, gazed at the sea dyke, and imagined the hardships endured by the people who built it, creating this miracle before my eyes. I couldn't help but say to myself, "It wasn't easy!"

Someone chuckled softly. I turned around and saw a young man standing in the shade of an acacia tree beside the pavilion. He looked to be in his twenties and resembled a farmer. His eyes were strange, as if he couldn't look at you directly, always tilting his head and glancing at you from the corner of his eye, seeming both alert and mischievous.

I pointed to the sea dyke and asked, "Do you think this was easy?"

The young man took off his pointed bamboo hat, fanning himself as he said, "Easy? I think nothing is easy in this world except eating. It would have been interesting if you could have seen the scene back then. So many people, blasting mountains to get stones, and then using the stones to fill the sea. Is the sea easy to fill? In the face of strong winds and waves, large stones weighing several tons were washed away in an instant. Besides, there were Chiang Kai-shek's planes overhead! Always coming to bomb. They came during the day and at night. When they came, I would hide; when they left, I would come out and keep building. It took more than two years to build it, but we finally did it."

I couldn't help but exclaim, "This is truly moving mountains and filling seas, benefiting future generations. These are truly remarkable people!"

The young man put on his bamboo hat, adjusted a load of seaweed that I couldn't name, and said, "I don't see anything remarkable about it." Saying that, he picked up the load of seaweed, glanced at me again from the corner of his eye, and asked mischievously, "Do you think there's anything remarkable about me?" He walked onto the sea dyke, the carrying pole bobbing on his shoulder, and walked away like the wind.

I watched the young man's figure. His figure was thin and small, but his actions were accurate and confident. This kind of person always knows where he comes from and where he's going; always knows what he's doing.

From the pavilion, I looked south and saw many figures similar to this young man, all so capable and confident, coming and going, carrying baskets of earth and building the roadbed right next to the sea dyke. This was another major construction project being undertaken by the local people – the Xiamen section of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. Every Xiamen person understands what this railway will bring to their destiny, so naturally they will do their best to build their own destiny. I often hear explosions, which is for quarrying stone for the Yingtan-Xiamen line. My residence is close to a large stone yard on the beach, and from dawn, I can hear the clanging of chisels drilling stones. The drilled stones are loaded onto ships, and to catch the tide, they set sail in the middle of the night, heading to another corner of the harbor, where another great undertaking of moving mountains and filling seas is being carried out, building a cross-sea dyke for the Yingtan-Xiamen line. Once, in the dense shade of a long-bearded banyan tree, I saw many elderly people concentrating on weaving something large out of bamboo. I found it strange. An old man didn't even lift his eyelids, weaving as he said, "Bamboo cages." I asked why they were weaving these large bamboo cages, but the old man didn't understand Northern speech very well and couldn't explain it clearly. But I immediately understood what he meant. I made a gesture of moving stones, stuffed it into the half-woven bamboo cage, and then raised both hands and threw it into the distance. The old man laughed and nodded repeatedly. Needless to say, you also understand: the large bamboo cages are for filling the sea with stones, again for the sake of the Yingtan-Xiamen line.

Xiamen people understand labor, and they also understand life. Every evening, the seawater in the harbor is like it's drunk lychee wine, evenly coated with a layer of sunset red light. All that's left of Gulangyu Island across the way is a blurry mountain shadow. At this time, under the flamboyant phoenix trees blooming along the coast, I often see large groups of working people resting in the evening breeze, or sitting together in twos and threes, carefully savoring Wuyi Mountain tea. From somewhere, the Fujian Nanyin music sounds, playing "Plum Blossom Melody," so peaceful and beautiful. I feel a kind of peaceful, poetic life from the bottom of my heart. Could this kind of life be on the front line?

But this is, after all, the front line, and the front line facing Taiwan. Now I am at our coastal artillery position. Lesser Kinmen lies horizontally before my eyes, separated by only six thousand meters of sea. In the slanting rays of the setting sun, I can clearly see the houses, trees, and enemy gun positions and fortifications built on the hilltops and coasts from the artillery telescope. But not a single figure can be seen. The setting sun is gone, and the island is covered in twilight. I suddenly noticed a figure in a white shirt leaning against a tree, motionless, clearly looking towards this side of the sea. What is he peering at? The moon rises from the bottom of the sea, the sea is calm and peaceful, flashing a golden light. At this moment, pleasant music slowly rises from the loudspeaker on the hill to my right, and after a while, I hear a clear male voice reporting the news of the motherland's construction to Kinmen Island. I looked through the artillery telescope again. Kinmen Island was pitch black, not even a spark of light could be seen.

Don't think the enemy will remain so silent. An observer told me that airplanes often appear in the sky above the island recently, dragging a long bag. When the wind fills it, it bulges so much, and the anti-aircraft guns below practice shooting. The enemy deeply feels a powerful force pressing down on him, and he can't help but panic. In a panic, he can only fire cold shots to embolden himself. But as soon as our artillery opens its mouth like a mountain collapsing and the earth splitting, the enemy immediately becomes silent, not even daring to breathe.

Can you say this isn't the front line? This is the front line, but not entirely the front line. Even in this most forward area, our people are taking consistent steps with the motherland, stepping deeper and deeper into their ideals.

I don't want to write too much about the construction of our coastal artillery. Their construction is certainly outstanding. If you suddenly discover a beautiful garden behind a gun position that has repeatedly performed meritorious service, can you say it's not outstanding? The garden is planted with scarlet sage, cornflowers, oleanders, and various kinds of flowers and trees, and a large peace dove spreading its wings is inlaid on the ground with shining seashells. Various flowers are blooming, and butterflies often fly around. A pink butterfly flew into the gun position, landed on the muzzle of the gun, its wings opening and closing, perhaps smelling some floral fragrance on the muzzle?

The more outstanding construction of these coastal artillerymen is helping the farmers move towards socialism. One evening after dinner, I followed the artillery company commander and a rangefinder named Lin Lichang to see the "Frontline Cooperative." The cooperative wasn't far from the artillery position. Red houses and green trees were everywhere, making it look very prosperous. The rice grew dark and strong, raising white flowers the size of rice grains, scattering a fragrance of steamed rice. The members were watering vegetables and cutting soybeans at the edge of the village. Seeing Lin Lichang, they competed to greet him: "Old Lin! Old Lin!" Lin Lichang went to the village three nights a week, helping the cooperative with literacy work, so he was naturally well-acquainted with everyone.

We wandered around the village, then came to the front of the cooperative director's house and sat in the shade of an old banyan tree. The director was named Lin Anxin, only twenty-four years old, very steady. His nephew, Lin Jincai, seventeen years old, with eyebrows and eyes like a painting, very handsome, also came out to serve tea and water, and entertain the guests.

I smiled at Lin Anxin and said, "Oh! You are engaging in socialism right under the enemy's nose."

Lin Anxin smiled rather reservedly and said, "The enemy just loves to fire cannons, intending to destroy. Unexpectedly they drop a volley of shells, destroying crops, killing cattle, but people haven't been hurt too much. It doesn't matter, no matter how bad, can they stop our road? Not to mention there are also the People's Liberation Army comrades sheltering us." Saying that, he glanced at the artillery company commander.

The company commander was a man of few words, and didn't open his mouth. Lin Lichang rushed to say, "If the cooperative has any work, just assign it to us, don't be polite."

Lin Anxin pondered and said, "You have put in no little effort..."

The effort put in by the artillerymen, according to what I just saw, included three newly dug ponds, filled with rainwater, which could be used to irrigate the land or ferment fertilizer; a clubhouse, inside which there were books, paintings, musical instruments, and toys such as checkers – all arranged with donations from the entire company; and a night school that Lin Lichang and others helped to set up. From Lin Anxin's mouth, I learned that the sailors also helped the cooperative pull wheat, sent double-wheeled double-shared plows, sent cows, and sent work-point record books, which, Lin Anxin said, could not be used up in a lifetime. However, the most valuable gift the soldiers provided to the cooperative was the cannons guarding the coast. Lin Anxin said, "We are engaged in socialism under the PLA's artillery muzzles."

The child Lin Jincai had originally been sitting beside, looking at the sky, listening to others speaking, only squinting and smiling, suddenly interjected, "Chiang Kai-shek is also supporting our cooperativization."

I laughed and asked, "Also using artillery support?"

Lin Jincai said, "That's right. When the shells are fired over, there are cannon shell casings. If you pick them up and sell them to the government, you can sell them for several hundred yuan, all of which becomes the cooperative's capital." Everyone laughed at what he said.

It was getting dark, and the cooperative still had to hold a meeting to discuss the issue of distributing work points. I should go, but something was holding me back, and I was reluctant to leave. In life, I have encountered so many good young people everywhere, all so vigorous, giving you the feeling that you are standing on the coast at dawn, the dew hasn't dried, and the sea breeze blows, filling you from the inside out with a fresh breath.

When we walked back along the beach, the moon had already risen high, and the fields were full of the sounds of insects. I don't know where a few explosions sounded. Some people said it was the enemy firing cannons, and others said we were blasting mountains ourselves. In Xiamen, it's always like this, sometimes it's the sound of cannons, and sometimes it's the sound of construction. We are carrying out construction in the sound of cannons, and we are strengthening the power to liberate Taiwan in the sound of construction. The winds and waves rose again at sea, and in the quiet of the night, the sound of the tide lapping against the shore could be heard. Looking into the distance, Kinmen Island was just a black shadow, floating on the sea, swaying, as if it would sink into the waves at any moment. I looked up at the moon, the sky was very clear. I thought, tomorrow the soldiers should help the "Frontline Cooperative" plant sweet potatoes. (Attached picture)

### 厦门港的风浪

    厦门港的风浪
    本报特约记者　杨朔
    荔枝正熟。这个季节，并不是东南沿海的风季，动不动你还是可以听见远远扬起一片类似呐喊的声音，于是本来碧绿碧绿的大海忽然会变黄了脸，卷起千万点雪似的浪头，紧跟着，那荔枝树、龙眼树、还有别的叶子发亮的树木，就会百般做弄出一片战争的声音。
    说真的，我原先猜想厦门处在海防的最前线，隔着条海峡就是台湾，大小金门岛更在眼睫毛底下，说不定该有多么紧张。其实不然。这儿是前线，又不像前线。这儿也像祖国的任何角落一样，正在建设着自己图画一般的生活。
    应该纠正地图上的一个错误。从地图上看，厦门四面环海，是个岛屿。实际上早不是个岛屿，而更像个半岛了。造成这个奇迹的是一道新修的海堤。我去看了看这道海堤，我在这道海堤前站着不能动了。多么惊人的创造啊！一条两公里多长的大堤，一色是雪白的花岗岩垒的，从北到南把一座波浪滔滔的海港一下子从中切断。海港切断，厦门岛却和北边的大陆连成一片了。
    海堤南头有座亭子，围着亭子栽满桉树、合欢树、相思树……每棵树都铺展着清凉的影子。来来往往过堤的人都爱在亭子里歇脚乘凉。我登上亭子，放眼望着海堤，想像着修堤的人怎样经过千辛万苦，创造出眼前这个奇迹，我不觉自言自语说：“真不容易啊！”
    有人轻轻笑了笑。我一回头，看见亭子旁一棵相思树的荫凉里立着个青年人，有二十几岁，模样像个农民。他的眼神很怪，好像不会正眼看人，总是歪着头，从眼角扫你几眼，显得又机警，又调皮。
    我指着海堤问：“你觉得这是容易的么？”
    那青年摘下头上戴的尖顶竹叶帽，一面扇风一面说：“容易？我看天底下除了吃饭，没有一件容易事。你要能看见当时的情形就有意思啦。那么多人，炸山采石头，又拿石头填海。海是容易填的么？大风大浪的，有时好几吨重的大石头，说冲走就冲走了。何况头顶上还有蒋介石的飞机！总来炸。白天来，黑夜也来。你来了，我躲一躲；你一走，我又出来修。足足修了两年多，到底修起来了。”
    我又不禁赞叹说：“这真是移山填海，造福万代，真是些了不起的人呐！”
    那青年戴上竹叶帽，整理着一担我叫不上名的海菜说：“我看也没有什么了不起。”说着挑起那担海菜，又从眼角扫了我一眼，怪调皮地问：“你觉得我有什么了不起么？”一面走上海堤，扁担在他肩膀上一颤一颤的，飞似的走了。
    我望着那青年的身影。他的身影又瘦又小，他的举动却是又准确，又自信。这种人总是懂得他从那儿来，他要到那儿去；总是懂得他自己在做什么。
    我从亭子上朝南望去，我望见许许多多类似这个青年的身影，都是那么精干，那么自信，正在紧连着海堤的地方来来往往挑着土篮，垒着路基。这是当地人民正在进行的另一个大建设——鹰厦铁路的厦门段。每个厦门人民都明白这条铁路会给他们的命运带来什么，自然要用全力来建设自己的命运。我时常听见炸山，这是在为鹰厦线采石头。我的住处紧临着海滩上一个大石场，天一亮就听见叮叮噹噹钻石头。钻好的石头装上船，为了赶潮，三更半夜扬帆而去，送到海港的另一角，那里正干着另一件移山填海的大事情，替鹰厦线修着跨海的大堤。有一回，在垂着长胡子的老榕树的浓荫里，我看见好些老年人聚精会神地用竹子编着什么大东西。我觉得奇怪，一个老人眼皮也不抬，一面编一面说：“竹笼啊”。编这些大竹笼又为什么，老人家不大懂北方话，说不清楚。我却立时清楚了他的意思。我做了个搬石头的手势，朝编了一半的竹笼里一装，又举起双手，往远处一投，老人就笑着连连点头。不用说，你也明白：大竹笼是要装石头填海，又是为的鹰厦线。
    厦门人懂得劳动，也懂得生活。每当黄昏，港湾里的海水像喝醉了荔枝酒似的，匀上一层晚霞的红光，对面鼓浪屿只剩下模糊的山影，这时候，在海岸上盛开着的凤凰红下，我常常看见大群大群的劳动人民迎着晚风歇凉，或者三三两两围坐在一起，细心品着武夷山茶。不知什么地方响起福建的南乐，奏的是“梅花操”，音调那么恬静、那么幽美，我从心里感到一种和平的诗意的生活。这种生活、难道会是在前线上么？
    但这里究竟还是前线，而且是面对着台湾的最前线。现在我是在我们海岸炮兵的阵地上，小金门横躺在我的眼前，中间只隔着六千来公尺的海面。夕阳斜照里，我从炮对镜里清清楚楚望得见岛子上的房屋，树木，还有敌人在山头海岸上修的炮位和工事。却不见一个人影。夕阳散了，岛子上暮沉沉的。我忽然发现有个穿白衬衫的人影倚在树上，一动不动，分明在望着大海这边。他正在张望什么呢？月亮从海底浮上来，海面上风平浪静，闪着一派金光。这工夫，我右手山头上的广播器里悠悠扬扬响起好听的音乐，一会就听见一个清亮的男音在向金门岛报告祖国的建设消息了。我又对着炮对镜望了一眼，金门岛黑漆漆的，连一星火光也看不见。
    别以为敌人肯这样沉寂下去的。观察员告诉我说，近来岛子上空常出现飞机，拖着条长口袋，风一灌，鼓的多大，下边的高射炮就练习射击。敌人深深感到一股强大的力量在压着他，不能不慌，一慌，只有乱打冷炮来替自己壮胆。可是只要我们的大炮山崩地裂似的一张嘴，敌人立刻悄没声的，连大气也不敢出了。
    你能说这不是前线么？这是前线，可又不完全是前线。就在这种最前沿地带，我们的人民也和祖国迈着一致的步子，一步深似一步地走进自己的理想里去。
    我不想多写我们海岸炮兵的建设。他们的建设当然出色。如果你在一个屡建奇功的炮阵地后边忽然发现漂亮的花园，能说这不出色？花园里面种着状元红、矢车菊、夹竹桃，以及各色的花木，还用闪亮的贝壳在地面镶出一只展翅飞舞的大和平鸽。杂花正开，时时有蝴蝶飞来飞去。一只粉蝴蝶不知怎么飞进炮阵地，落到炮口上，两只翅膀一张一合的，也许是闻到炮口上有什么花香了吧？
    这些海岸炮兵更出色的建设是帮助农民走进社会主义去。有一天晚饭后，我跟着炮兵连长和一个叫林礼昌的测距员去看“前沿合作社”。合作社离炮阵地不远，到处红屋绿树，显得很富足。稻子长得又黑又壮，扬着米粒大小的白花，飘散着一股焖饭的香味。社员们正在村边浇菜，割豆子，看见林礼昌，争着招呼：“老林！老林”林礼昌每星期要到村里去三个晚上，帮着合作社做扫盲工作，人缘自然熟。
    我们在村里转了转，随后来到合作社主任门前，坐到老榕树荫凉里。主任叫林安心，只有二十四岁，稳重得很。他侄儿林进财，十七岁，眉眼像画似的，很俊，也出来端茶送水，招待客人。
    我对林安心笑着说：“哎呀！你们是在敌人鼻子底下搞社会主义啊。”
    林安心怪含蓄地一笑说：“敌人也就是爱打炮，存心破坏。冷不防撂过一排子炮弹，炸毁庄稼，炸死牛，人倒没怎么的。不要紧，再坏，还能挡住咱的路啦？别说还有解放军同志掩护着呢。”说着望了望炮兵连长。
    连长是个寡言寡语的人，没开口。林礼昌抢着说：“社里有什么活，只管分配给我们做，可别客气。”
    林安心沉吟着说：“你们费的心也不少啦……”
    炮兵们费的心，据我刚才看见的，有三口新挖的水塘，存满雨水，可以浇地，也可以沤肥料；有一个俱乐部，内里有书、有画、有乐器、有跳棋一类的玩具——是由全连战士捐款布置的；还有一所林礼昌等人帮着筹办的夜校。从林安心咀里，我知道水兵们还替合作社拔麦子，送双轮双铧犁，送牛，送记工分的本子，这些本子，林安心说，用一辈子也用不完。不过战士们支援合作社最贵重的礼物却是警卫着海防的大炮。林安心说：“我们是在解放军的炮口下搞社会主义啊。”
    林进财那孩子原先坐在旁边，眼望着天，听着旁人说话，光是眯着眼笑，忽然插咀说：“人家蒋介石也支援咱们合作化呢。”
    我笑着问：“也是用大炮支援吧？”
    林进财说：“可不是。炮弹打过来，有的是炮弹皮，你捡一捡卖给政府，多的能卖好几百元，都变做合作社的资金。”说的大家都笑了。
    天早黑了，合作社还要开会，讨论分配工分的问题。我应该走了，可又有什么东西恋着我，总舍不得走。在生活当中，我处处遇见过这样一些好青年，都是那么蓬蓬勃勃的，给你一种感觉，好像你是站在黎明的海岸上，露水未干，海风吹来，使你从里到外都充满一种清新的气息。
    我们沿着海滩往回走时，月亮已经升起多高，遍野都是草虫叫。不知那儿响起几声爆炸。有人说是敌人打炮，也有人说是我们自己在崩山。在厦门总是这样，有时是炮音，有时又是建设的声音。我们就是在炮声里进行建设，在建设的声音里增强着解放台湾的力量。海上又起了风浪，夜静当中，听得见海潮拍岸的声响。远远望去，金门岛只是一片黑影，漂在海上，摇摇晃晃的，好像随时都会沉到波浪里去。我仰起头望望月亮，天很晴朗。我想，明儿战士们也许该帮着“前沿合作社”种蕃薯了。（附图片）
