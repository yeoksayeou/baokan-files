This incident occurred within the People's Committee of Jieyu County, Shanxi Province. The situation is as follows: Ma Wukun, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section, reported some errors of County Head Shi Feng and Deputy County Head Chen Mingchao when he reported his work to the Special Commissioner's Office in January this year. Shi Feng had groundlessly insulted Guo Dequan, a demobilized construction soldier working in the hospital, and ordered the Personnel Section to stop Guo's work; Chen Mingchao abused his authority, calling Li Linze, a clerk from the Civil Affairs Section, to his room to issue a marriage certificate to his niece, and he used 50 yuan of preferential treatment and relief funds to "relieve" his own niece. The Special Commissioner's Office issued a circular criticizing their mistakes. The province and the Special Commissioner's Office also organized an inspection team to investigate and confirmed that Ma Wukun's report was factual.

Instead of examining their mistakes, the two county heads, Shi and Chen, reprimanded and attacked Ma Wukun for reporting their mistakes. After receiving the circular from the Special Commissioner's Office, they summoned Ma Wukun to their room and reprimanded him, saying: Who told you to report to the Special Commissioner's Office! You are an old clerk in the Civil Affairs Section, and you don't even understand this! You are extremely muddleheaded. In the future, any reports you make must be approved by the leadership. You are not allowed to report casually. You are disorganized and undisciplined.... Ma Wukun had no choice but to remain silent. Not satisfied with this reprimand, the two county heads, on July 2nd, when Ma Wukun was selected as a learning activist to attend the county's meeting of learning activists because of his good studies. In writing about his learning gains, Ma Wukun wrote a passage that said: After studying the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I believe in "integrating learning with application, pursuing truth in everything I do, and fighting bad people and bad things when I encounter them." "Fighting bad people and bad things" is the duty of every citizen of New China. There was nothing wrong with writing this way when writing about his learning experience, but the two county heads, Shi and Chen, angrily said: "Ma Wukun is making a fuss, calling us bad people and bad things. Who elected him as this model?" In fact, the "bad people and bad things" that Ma Wukun wrote about did not refer to the two county heads. The mistakes made by comrades Shi Feng and Chen Mingchao were only general mistakes, and of course, they could not be considered "bad people and bad things." However, they still created extraneous problems and used organizational means to revoke Ma Wukun's title of learning activist. A responsible comrade from the Jieyu County Supervision Committee of the Communist Party of China once offered them advice in good faith, but County Head Shi Feng flew into a rage and said, "You are interfering too much. You are in charge of everything, even my affairs as county head."

The behavior of the two county heads, Shi Feng and Chen Mingchao, is actually suppressing criticism and retaliating against Ma Wukun for reporting their mistakes, which is unacceptable. Shi Feng is a Communist Party member and must, of course, work under the supervision of the Party. The Jieyu County Supervision Committee of the Communist Party of China has every right to inquire about this matter. Shi Feng reprimanded Ma Wukun for being "disorganized and undisciplined," but his attitude towards Comrade Hu Taihe of the Jieyu County Supervision Committee of the Communist Party of China is truly disorganized and undisciplined!

    究竟是谁无组织无纪律
    这件事发生在山西省解虞县人民委员会里，情况是这样的：民政科员马武坤在今年一月间到专署汇报工作时，揭发了县长史峰和副县长陈明潮的一些错误：史峰曾经无故辱骂在医院工作的复员建设军人郭德全，并命令人事科停止了郭的工作；陈明潮滥用职权，把民政科员李林泽叫到他房中给他侄女领结婚证，他又动用了优抚救济款五十元“救济”了自己的侄女。专署通报批评了他们的错误，省里和专署还组织检查组作了检查，证明马武坤揭发的是事实。
    史、陈二位县长对自己的错误不但不检查，反而训斥和打击揭发他错误的马武坤。他们接到专署的通报后，就把马武坤叫到房中训斥说：谁叫你向专署反映！你是民政科老科员，连这个都不懂！真糊涂极啦，以后向上反映什么都得经领导批准，不准随便反映，无组织，无纪律……。马武坤只好一声不吭。这样训斥一顿，二位县长还不满意。七月二日马武坤因为学习好被评选为出席县学习积极分子大会的学习积极分子。马武坤在写自己的学习收获中写了一段这样的话：我学习苏共党史后，“学用一致，每作一件事情要追求真理，遇到坏人坏事我就向他作斗争”。“向坏人坏事作斗争”，这是新中国每一个公民应尽的义务。在写学习心得时这样写当然没有错，可是史、陈二位县长却怒气冲冲地说：“马武坤胡闹，把我们说成是坏人坏事了，谁评选的他这模范”。其实马武坤所写“坏人坏事”并不是指的两位县长，史峰、陈明潮二位同志所犯的也只是一般的错误，当然也不能算作“坏人坏事”。可是他们还是节外生枝地利用组织手段取消了马武坤学习积极分子的称号。中共解虞县监察委员会的一个负责同志曾善意地向他们提出了意见，史峰县长反大发雷霆地说“你管的太宽了，什么事情你都管，连我县长的事你也管了”。
    史峰、陈明潮两位县长这种行为实际是压制批评，对揭发他们错误的马武坤实行打击报复，是不能容许的。史峰是共产党员，当然要在党的监督下进行工作。中共解虞县监察委员会完全有权过问这件事。史峰训斥马武坤“无组织无纪律”，而他对待中共解虞县监察委员会呼太和同志的态度，才是真正的无组织无纪律呢！
