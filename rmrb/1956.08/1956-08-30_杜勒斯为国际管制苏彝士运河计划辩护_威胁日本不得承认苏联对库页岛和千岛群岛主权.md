Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles discussed the Suez Canal issue at a press conference on August 28th.

Dulles, on the one hand, acknowledged that the Suez Canal is within Egyptian territory and has been under Egyptian control for a short period of time, which is an indisputable fact. However, on the other hand, he attempted to disregard Egyptian sovereignty. He said that he did not think it necessary to view the issue from "slogans" such as "nationalism versus colonialism."

In his lengthy answers regarding the Suez Canal, Dulles consistently emphasized that the Suez Canal is an "international waterway," saying that the plan for "international control" of the canal that he proposed at the London conference was "generally fair." He expressed satisfaction with Egyptian President Nasser's agreement to meet with the "Five-Nation Committee."

At the same time, Dulles made unwarranted accusations against the Soviet representative who attended the London conference, insisting that the Soviet representative's position of upholding Egyptian sovereignty and advocating a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal issue was hindering the solution of the problem.

A reporter asked Dulles to comment on certain "misunderstandings" that had arisen between the Republic of Panama and the United States regarding the Panama Canal. Dulles said he was unaware of any "misunderstandings." He said that the Panama Canal was "completely different in two major respects" from the Suez Canal. First, the Suez Canal is so-called "internationalized," while "the Panama Canal is a waterway in a region where the United States, by treaty, possesses all the rights it would possess if it were a sovereign state, and the Republic of Panama is wholly without any such sovereignty, power, or authority." Second, the Suez Canal is, in effect, the "lifeline" of many countries, but no country in the world would be harmed by the United States possibly misusing or abusing its rights in the Panama Canal.

Dulles also spoke about the Japanese-Soviet negotiations. His remarks confirmed America's territorial ambitions towards Japan. He admitted that he had made such representations to the Japanese government several times: if Japan recognized Soviet sovereignty over South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, the United States would consider that it could demand permanent possession of Okinawa and other islands of the Ryukyu Islands.

In answering questions, Dulles mentioned the incident of a so-called U.S. aircraft being shot down over the Chinese coast. He said that the United States had made contact with China through British diplomatic representatives regarding this matter and had received notification from the Chinese side late on the 27th. He said that the notification acknowledged that an aircraft had been hit at about the same time and in the same area as the so-called U.S. aircraft being shot down, but that they said it was an aircraft of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. A reporter asked whether there were any survivors from the crew of the U.S. aircraft that was shot down. Dulles replied, "To the best of our knowledge, there were no survivors."

### 杜勒斯为国际管制苏彝士运河计划辩护  威胁日本不得承认苏联对库页岛和千岛群岛主权

    杜勒斯为国际管制苏彝士运河计划辩护
    威胁日本不得承认苏联对库页岛和千岛群岛主权
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯8月28日在记者招待会上谈到苏彝士运河问题。
    杜勒斯一方面承认，苏彝士运河是在埃及领土内，而且在埃及控制之下已经有一个短时期了，这是无可置辩的事实，可是，另一方面他又企图无视埃及的主权。他说，他认为没有必要从“民族主义对殖民主义”之类的“口号”来看待这个问题。
    杜勒斯在他关于苏彝士运河的长篇答问里一味强调苏彝士运河是一条“国际水道”，说他在伦敦会议上提出的对这条运河实行“国际管制”的计划“大体上是公平的”。他对埃及纳赛尔总统同意和“五国委员会”会谈一事表示满意。
    同时，杜勒斯对出席伦敦会议的苏联代表横加诬蔑，硬说苏联代表在会议上采取的维护埃及主权、主张和平解决苏彝士运河问题的立场是阻挠问题的解决。
    有记者要杜勒斯就巴拿马共和国和美国之间在巴拿马运河问题上产生的某些“误解”发表意见。杜勒斯说他不知道有什么“误解”。他说，巴拿马运河同苏彝士运河“在两个重大方面是完全不同的”。第一，苏彝士运河是所谓“国际化”的，而“巴拿马运河是在这样一个地区中的水道：美国在这个地区中根据条约拥有如果它是主权国就会拥有的一切权利，而巴拿马共和国完全不得引用任何这样的主权、权力或权威”。第二，苏彝士运河实际上是所谓许多国家的“生命线”，但是，世界上没有任何国家会由于美国可能错用或滥用它在巴拿马运河中的权利而遭到损害。
    杜勒斯还谈到日苏谈判问题。他的谈话证实了美国对日本的领土野心。他承认，他曾经好几次向日本政府作过这种表示：如果日本承认苏联对南库页岛和千岛群岛的主权，美国就认为它可以要求永久占有冲绳岛和琉球群岛的其他岛屿。
    杜勒斯在回答问题的时候，谈到所谓有一架美国飞机曾经在中国沿海上空被击落的事件。他说，美国已经通过英国的外交代表同中国就这件事进行接触，并且已经在27日深夜获得了中国方面的通知。他说，这个通知承认在所谓美国飞机被击落的大约那个时候和那一带地区有一架飞机被击中，但是他们说那是一架蒋介石集团的飞机。有记者问，关于那架被击落的美国飞机，机上人员是否有任何生还者？杜勒斯回答说：“就我们所知，没有生还者。”
