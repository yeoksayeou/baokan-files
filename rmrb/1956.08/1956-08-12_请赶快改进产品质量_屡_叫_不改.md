    Please Quickly Improve Product Quality
    Repeated "Calls" Unheeded
    The socks produced by the Tianjin Municipal Joint Public-Private Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Company were criticized at the Tianjin Municipal Quality and Price Comparison Exhibition in April 1955. The shortcomings pointed out at the time were: the shape of the socks was incorrect, the top and bottom were the same thickness, and consumers called them "ox-hoof socks"; there were even "mandarin duck socks," one with a single yarn and one with double yarn, one with a single sole and one with a double sole. The leaders of this factory once admitted that the quality of their products was poor and stated that they would improve quality. However, there was no improvement as a result, and consumers still had many complaints.
    In March of this year, the leaders and engineering technicians of Tianjin Municipal Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Company came to Beijing to visit the Daily Use Industrial Products Quality Exhibition. After looking at the substandard products from their factory and the excellent products from various places, they again stated that they would take effective measures to improve product quality upon returning. However, recently, the Tianjin delegation took several pairs of socks that the factory claimed had been "improved," intending to bring them to the Daily Use Industrial Products Quality Exhibition to demonstrate that the factory no longer produced "ox-hoof socks." Unexpectedly, after these pairs of socks were inspected, they turned into "ox-hoof socks" again after being washed.
    The relevant leading departments in Tianjin Municipality should quickly urge and help the Tianjin Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Company to earnestly improve product quality.　Ding Yuqi

    请赶快改进产品质量
    屡“叫”不改
    天津市公私合营漂染整公司生产的袜子，在1955年4月天津市比质比价展览会上受过批评，当时指出的缺点是：袜形不正，上下一般粗，消费者称它是“牛蹄式的袜子”；甚至还有一只单纱，一只双纱，一只单底，一只双底的“鸳鸯袜”。这个厂的领导人员曾经承认自己的产品质量差，并且表示要提高质量。可是，结果并没有什么改进，消费者的意见还是很多。
    今年三月，天津市漂染整公司的领导人员和工程技术人员，到北京来参观日用工业品质量展览会，看了一下他们厂子的次品和各地的优良产品，又表示这次回去一定要采取有效措施，改进产品质量。可是，最近，天津代表团把这个厂“已经改进了”的袜子拿了几双，准备带到日用工业品质量展览会来说明这个厂不再生产“牛蹄式袜子”了。不料这几双袜子经过鉴定，下水后又变成了“牛蹄式”。
    天津市的有关领导部门，应该赶快督促和帮助天津漂染整公司认真改进产品质量。　丁玉琪
