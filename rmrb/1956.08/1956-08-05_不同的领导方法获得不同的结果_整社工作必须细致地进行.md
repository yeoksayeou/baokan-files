Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 1st: Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Dian and Chen Zheng report: The Communist Party Committees of various counties (cities) in Yunnan Province adopted two different leadership methods in the summer rectification of cooperatives, and achieved different results.

One leadership method is: When the rectification of cooperatives began, members of the County Party Committee went deep into key areas to start with summarizing production, discovered current problems, mobilized cooperative members to study and solve them, and then promoted the rectification experience of these key cooperatives. The Communist Party Committees of Yiliang, Fumin, Yuxi, and Shiping counties adopted this method. Under the assistance of the County Party Committee, Chunhe Cooperative in Yuxi County, through inspection, divided into various specialized groups by production team to adapt to the situation in Yunnan where the weather is variable and the farm work is fragmented during the summer hoeing season. This not only carried out the summer hoeing work, but also improved the working ability of township and cooperative cadres. After gaining experience in leadership, they used two or three days to convene joint meetings of Party branch secretaries and cooperative directors by region to quickly promote the rectification experience throughout the county. The cadres below felt that there was something to follow, and the rectification work was quickly carried out.

Another leadership method, such as that of the Rural Work Department of the Kunming Municipal Party Committee, after the start of the rectification work, leading cadres did not personally go deep into guidance, but concentrated the main cadres of the seventy-six townships in the suburbs of the city, such as Party and Communist Youth League branch secretaries, organization members, women's directors, and agricultural cooperative directors, to Kunming to attend a rectification training class. The first training class lasted for ten days. As soon as these cadres entered the training class, the work in the cooperative had to be led by the chief accountant. As a result, the accountant could not lead overall production, and the rectification work had to wait for the cadres to return from training to begin. The Municipal Party Committee's Rural Work Department actually had no idea how to carry out rectification and could not provide a model for rectification. This wasted time and affected production.

The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee studied these two situations, corrected the Kunming Municipal Party Committee's approach, and issued instructions requiring all counties to immediately adopt the former method to carry out the rectification work meticulously, and to no longer conduct training classes on a large scale from above.

### 不同的领导方法获得不同的结果  整社工作必须细致地进行

    不同的领导方法获得不同的结果
    整社工作必须细致地进行
    新华社昆明1日电　新华社记者王甸、陈铮报道：中共云南省各县（市）委员会，在夏季整社工作中采取了两种不同的领导方法，获得了不同的结果。
    一种领导方法是：中共县委会的委员们在整社开始就分别深入重点，从总结生产入手，发现当前存在的问题，发动社员研究解决，然后推广这个重点社的整社经验。宜良、富民、玉溪、石屏等县的中共县委会就是采取这种方法的。玉溪县春和社在县委帮助下，通过检查，以生产队为单位划分了各种专业小组，以适应云南在夏锄期间天气多变农活零碎的情况，这样既把夏锄工作开展起来，又提高了乡、社干部的工作能力，领导上取得经验以后，又用二、三天的时间分片召开党支部书记和社主任的联席会议，把整社经验迅速在全县推广。下面干部都感到有所遵循，整社工作迅速的开展起来。
    另一种领导方法，如中共昆明市委农村工作部，整社工作开始以后，领导干部不去亲自深入指导，却集中了市郊七十六个乡的党、团支部书记、组织委员、妇女主任、农业社主任等主要干部，到昆明来住整社训练班，第一期训练班就办了十天。这些干部一进训练班，社里的工作，就只好由总会计领导，结果，会计领导不了全面生产，整社工作又要等干部受训回来才能着手。而市委农村工作部对整社其实也心中无数，拿不出整社的样子。既耽误了时间，又影响了生产。
    中共云南省委研究了这两种情况，已经纠正了昆明市委的做法，并且发出指示，要求各县要立即采取前一种方法，把整社工作细致的开展起来，不要再大轰大擂地在上面办训练班。
