    (Our report) The wheat, highland barley, flax, rapeseed, beans, sugar beets, and other crops trial-planted by the Haixi Agricultural Experiment Station in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, are growing very well and are now approaching maturity.
    The "No. 116" and "No. 62" wheat varieties trial-planted here are growing the best, with large ears and many grains, and a plant height of 1.22 meters. According to field estimates, the yield per mu can reach about 727 jin. Datong rapeseed grows very well here, with a plant height of 1.31 meters, and many pods that are neat and uniform. The yield per mu can reach 100 to 150 jin. Sugar beet has the strongest adaptability in the basin, not only being alkali-resistant and drought-resistant, and growing vigorously, but also having very large roots. It is estimated that the yield per mu can reach about 6,000 jin. The broad beans and field peas planted here also have very dense pods.
    The rice, cotton, millet, foxtail millet, corn, and sunflowers trial-planted by the Haixi Agricultural Experiment Station in the Qaidam Basin are also growing very well. Currently, all the staff of the experiment station are welcoming the harvest with joy. (Liu Yunsheng)

    柴达木盆地试种农作物生长良好
    本报讯　青海省海西农业试验站在柴达木盆地试种的小麦、青稞、胡麻、油菜、豆类、甜菜等，生长都很良好，现已接近成熟。
    这里试种的“116号”和“62号”小麦生长最好，穗大粒多，株高一点二二公尺，根据田间估计，每亩可收七百二十七斤左右。大通油菜在这里长的很好，株高一点三一公尺，结荚多而整齐，亩产可到一百到一百五十斤。糖用甜菜在盆地的适应性最强，不仅抗碱耐旱、生长茂盛，而且块根很大。估计亩产可到六千斤左右。这里种植的蚕豆、莞豆也结荚很稠。
    海西农业试验站在柴达木盆地试种的水稻、棉花、糜、谷、玉米和向日葵等也都生长的很好。目前试验站的全体职工，正以愉快的心情，迎接丰收。　（刘云升）
