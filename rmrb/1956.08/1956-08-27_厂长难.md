Title: It's Hard to Be a Factory Director

It is often heard from some outsiders with a sympathetic tone saying: It seems that in these times, being a factory director is the most difficult. When an accident occurs, the factory director is criticized for not paying attention to safety; if the quality is poor, the factory director is criticized for one-sided pursuit of output value; if workers do not have enough housing, the factory director is criticized for being bureaucratic; if materials are insufficient, the factory director is criticized for setting production plans that are too "rash"; if workers exceed the quota, the factory director is criticized for being "conservative."

Factory directors, on the other hand, are rarely heard to raise any objections to these criticisms; at least, no factory director has been seen in newspapers to offer any "counter-criticism" to "criticism." This is probably because what is criticized is indeed the fact: accidents do occur in the factory; product quality is indeed not good; worker dormitories are indeed overcrowded; the results of practice prove that the original plan was indeed "rash" or "conservative." As the head of a factory, one is, of course, duty-bound.

However, inwardly, they are not entirely convinced by every criticism. Some factory directors privately say to old friends: "Can a factory director avoid criticism? More fleas don't itch, more debts aren't a worry, more criticism doesn't matter." Some factory directors, on the other hand, hold a bellyful of resentment and cannot hold their heads up for a long time.

It should be admitted that most of the criticisms of factories from leading bodies or newspapers are correct; there are also some factory directors who do not have enough self-criticism and often like to attribute the responsibilities they should bear to objective difficulties.

However, why are many criticisms unable to convince factory directors, and even onlookers come forward to defend them? There must be a reason for this.

One reason, perhaps, is that these criticisms point out some real situations, but they are not comprehensive. Life itself is not so simple. Accidents, low quality, and workers not having houses to live in are not necessarily all due to problems with the factory director's thinking. If that were the case, things would be easy. As long as the factory director is well educated, all work will be perfect. Unfortunately, real life is much more complicated. The same result often has different causes. One thing is rarely caused by just one reason. The Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory always fails to complete its production tasks, and a very important reason is due to open-air operations without a drying room; the workers' housing is not enough because the number of workers has increased by more than 500, and the higher authorities do not give money, so the houses cannot be increased. Without analyzing these specific conditions, grabbing a "universally applicable" hat and putting it on the factory director is, of course, the easiest way. However, such criticism often makes people feel that it is not realistic and makes the criticized feel wronged, and sometimes even the correct parts of the criticism cannot get the effect they deserve.

Another reason, perhaps, is that these critics are simply criticizing and not giving the criticized specific help. Some problems cannot be solved simply by the factory director admitting the mistake. For example, if the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry and the Yunnan Provincial Planning Commission do not allocate certain funds to the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory to help them build the necessary factory buildings, drying rooms, and worker dormitories, I am afraid that in another year, two years, or three years, the factory director's shortcomings of "not caring about workers' lives" and "failing to complete production tasks" will still exist. Of course, the leading cadres of this factory cannot be perfect. They may indeed have the shortcomings of "not paying attention to ideological education" and "not being sensitive to new things," as pointed out by the Kunming Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry, and may even have more serious problems. However, most of our factory directors are transferred from non-professionals, and there must be a learning process from not knowing to knowing. Even if they are professionals, their leadership ability is still strong and weak. Making a backward factory look decent also requires a certain amount of time and a certain amount of external assistance. Like the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry, it does not help solve the obvious objective difficulties existing in the factory and lets the factory director fight alone; and if the factory director does not improve the factory in half a year or a year, he is removed and replaced by someone else. Using cadres in this way, I am afraid that anyone with both ability and integrity will find it difficult to do the work well.

Whether it is the leading body or the newspaper, I hope that in the future when criticizing factories, they will do more specific analysis, write whose fault on whose account, and instruct those who should solve the problem to solve it. We do not ask for condoning mistakes or indulging factory directors, but do not strike down with one blow, regardless of right and wrong. In particular, it is hoped that more specific help will be given to the lower levels. It is easy to go to the factory for inspection, find shortcomings, and raise them to a "principled height." However, it is of no avail. Because the purpose of criticism is to improve work, not just for the "factory director to recognize the mistake." As for the factory directors, they should give play to the "fighting spirit," and when accepting tasks, they should also ask the superiors to create the objective conditions necessary for completing the tasks. This is not to encourage the factory directors to rely on the superiors in everything and emphasize difficulties; but to advocate seeking truth from facts. Because the purpose is to do the work well. Otherwise, "hard work and complaint-free" is certainly a good virtue, but the interests of the country will often be damaged as a result, and the suffering of the workers will often not receive the attention it deserves.

    厂长难
    ?眉
    常常听到一些局外人以同情的口吻说：看来，这年头当厂长最难了。出了事故，批评厂长不重视安全；质量不好，批评厂长片面追求产值；职工房子不够住，批评厂长官僚主义；材料不够了，批评厂长把生产计划订得“冒进”了；工人突破了定额，又批评厂长“保守”。
    厂长们呢，倒很少听见他们对这些批评提出过什么异议；至少在报纸上还没有看到过哪位厂长对“批评”提出过“反批评”。这大概是因为，所批评的确都是事实：厂里确实出了事故；产品质量确实不好；职工宿舍确实拥挤不堪；实践的结果证明，原来订的计划确实是“冒进”或“保守”了。身为一厂之长，当然责无旁贷。
    然而，内心却并非对每一次批评都心悦诚服。有的厂长私下里对老朋友说：“当厂长还能不受批评？虱子多了不咬，债多了不愁，批评多了，无所谓。”有的厂长则是闷着一肚子怨气，长期抬不起头来。
    应当承认，不论是领导机关或是报纸，对工厂的批评当中，绝大部分都是正确的；也有一些厂长，自我批评精神不大够，常常好把自己应该负的责任诿之于客观困难。
  然而，为什么有许多批评不能使厂长们服气，甚而旁观者也起而打抱不平呢？其中必有缘故。
    想来，一个原因恐怕是：这些批评虽然指出了一部分真实情况，然而不全面。生活本身并不那么简单，出事故、质量低、职工没房子住，未必一概都是由于厂长的思想有问题。如果这样，事情倒好办了。只要把厂长教育好，一切工作就都会尽善尽美了。可惜实际生活要复杂得多。同样的结果，原因多半各不相同。一件事情，也很少只是由于一个原因造成的。云南砖瓦厂总完不成生产任务，很重要的一个原因是由于露天作业，没有干燥室；职工的房子不够住，是因为工人增加了五百多，上级不给钱，房子不能增加。不分析这些具体条件，抓起一顶“到处通用”的帽子给厂长扣上，这当然是最省事的办法。然而，这样的批评常常使人感到不实事求是，使被批评者感到委屈，有时甚至连带到批评中的正确部分也不能得到应有的效果。
    还有一个原因，恐怕是这些批评人的人只是单纯的批评，而没有给被批评者以具体帮助。有些问题，并不是厂长承认了错误就可以解决的。譬如，云南省工业厅和云南省计划委员会如果不给云南砖瓦厂拨付一定的款项，帮助他们建设必要的厂房、干燥室和职工宿舍，恐怕再过一年、两年、三年，厂长“不关心工人生活”“完不成生产任务”的缺点还会存在。当然，这个厂的领导干部不可能是完人，他们很可能确实有昆明市工会和云南省工业厅厅长所指出的“不注意思想教育”、“对新鲜事物不敏感”等等缺点，甚至可能有更严重的毛病。但是，我们的厂长绝大部分都是从外行转业的，从不会到会，总要有个学习过程。即使是内行吧，领导能力也还有强有弱，把一个落后的工厂搞得像样，也需要一定的时间，并且需要一定的外力援助。像云南省工业厅那样，厂里明显存在的客观困难不去帮助解决，让厂长孤军奋斗；而厂长半年一年没有把工厂搞好，就撤掉另换别人。这样来使用干部，恐怕任何德才兼优的人也难于把工作做好。
    不管是领导机关也好，报纸也好，希望今后在批评工厂的时候，还是多作些具体分析，是谁的错写在谁的账上，该谁解决的责成谁来解决。我们并不要求对错误迁就，对厂长宽纵，但是，不要不分青红皂白，一棒子打倒。尤其希望的是：多给下面一些具体帮助。到工厂去检查一下，发现缺点，提到“原则高度”，这是容易的。然而于事无补。因为批评的目的是改进工作，而不只是“厂长认识了错误”而已。至于厂长们，倒是应该发挥一下“斗争精神”，接受任务的时候，同时也要求上级给创造完成任务所必需的客观条件。这不是鼓动厂长们凡事依赖上级，强调困难；而是提倡实事求是。因为目的是为了把工作搞好。否则，“任劳任怨”固然是好品德，然而国家的利益却往往会因而受到损害，工人的疾苦往往因而得不到应有的关怀。
