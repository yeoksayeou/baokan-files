    To Ensure Smooth Production After Project Completion:
    Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Urges Newly Built Factories to Strengthen Production Preparation

    (Our Wuhan Dispatch) The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a production preparation work conference for newly built factories, requiring Party organizations in all newly built factories to quickly strengthen leadership over production preparation work to ensure that all projects are put into production on schedule after completion.

    Wuhan has several large-scale and technically complex newly built factories, such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex and the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant. The capital construction projects of these factories will be completed one to two years ahead of schedule, and several workshops will be put into production successively from the first half of next year. The task of production preparation is very heavy, and time is also pressing. However, except for the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which started earlier and is doing better, the rest of the factories are mostly still in the stage of exploring the situation and formulating plans, lagging behind actual needs. The number of personnel recruited by the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex has only reached one-ninth of the first-phase planned training number; the number of personnel sent to Anshan for training has also only reached one-seventh of the original plan due to unresolved accommodation issues; some types of work cannot even find factories to train personnel.

    In view of this situation, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires Party organizations in all newly built factories to recognize the importance, complexity, and arduousness of production preparation work, overcome the idea of underestimating production preparation work, separate the institutions in charge of capital construction and production preparation, and at the same time, strengthen political and ideological education, strengthen planning and organizational work, to ensure smooth production after the completion of various projects and strive to reach the designed level of production ahead of schedule.

    At this meeting, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant introduced its experience in carrying out production preparation work.

    Also News: The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is seriously carrying out production preparation work and has achieved preliminary results.

    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is an all-round machine manufacturing plant. Its products all weigh more than twenty tons to more than one hundred tons, and the precision requirements are also very high.

    The leaders of this factory learned the lesson from a certain factory in the Northeast that could not start production on schedule due to poor production preparation work. In the early stage of factory construction, they sent a group of technical cadres to study in various domestic and foreign factories in the same industry. In the first half of this year, it recruited more than 2,000 apprentices and sent them to 19 factories in the same industry across the country to study. Now there are production personnel, accounting for half of the number of factory organizational design, who have been trained in actual production.

    Since December of last year, this factory has organized other factories in Jinan, Shenyang, and other places to conduct trial production of four types and six specifications of products, and sent 288 technicians and senior technicians to participate in the trial production. The trial production of two types and three specifications of samples can be completed within the year. Since the spring of this year, this factory has also sent many people to factories in the same industry to collect technical data, investigate the domestic product situation, and select objects for future production cooperation. Recently, this factory has sent ten working groups to various places to negotiate support issues with factories in the same industry and to inspect the training of technicians, in order to adapt to the new situation that capital construction projects will be completed one and a half years ahead of schedule.

### 保证工程完工以后顺利投入生产  武汉市委督促新建工厂加强生产准备工作

    保证工程完工以后顺利投入生产
    武汉市委督促新建工厂加强生产准备工作
    本报武汉讯　中共武汉市委最近召开新建工厂生产准备工作会议，要求各新建工厂党组织迅速加强对生产准备工作的领导，保证各项工程完工以后如期投入生产。
    武汉市有武汉钢铁联合企业、武汉重型机床厂等几个规模巨大、技术复杂的新建工厂。这些工厂的基本建设工程将分别提前一年到二年完工，从明年上半年起，将陆续有若干车间投入生产。生产准备工作的任务很繁重，时间也很紧迫。但是，除了武汉重型机床厂动手较早、作得较好以外，其余各厂多还处在摸索情况、制定计划的阶段，落后于实际需要。武汉钢铁联合企业招考到的人员，现在只达第一期计划培训人数的九分之一；送往鞍山培训的人员也因为住宿问题没有解决，只达到原计划的七分之一；有些工种还找不到代训工厂。
    根据这种情况，中共武汉市委要求各新建工厂党组织认清生产准备工作的重要性、复杂性和艰苦性，克服轻视生产准备工作的思想，将管基本建设和生产准备工作的机构分开，同时要加强政治思想教育，加强计划组织工作，以保证各项工程完工以后顺利投入生产，并且争取使生产提前达到设计水平。
    在这次会上，武汉重型机床厂介绍了进行生产准备工作的经验。
    又讯　武汉重型机床厂认真进行生产准备工作，取得初步成绩。
    武汉重型机床厂是一座万能性的机器制造厂。它的产品都重达二十多吨到一百多吨，精密度的要求也很高。
    这个厂的领导人员接受了东北某厂因为生产准备工作不好而不能如期开工生产的教训，在工厂筹建初期就派出一批技术干部，分别到国内外各同业工厂学习。今年上半年又招收了两千多名徒工，派到全国十九个同业工厂去学习，现在已经有占工厂组织设计人数一半的生产人员，在实际生产中得到了锻炼。
    这个厂从去年十二月起，分头在济南、沈阳等地组织外厂进行四种类型、六种规格的产品试制工作，派出二百八十八名技术人员和高级技工去参加试制。有两种类型、三种规格的样品试制工作，可争取在年内完成。这个厂还从今年春天起派了许多人到同业工厂收集技术资料，调查国内产品情况，为将来的生产协作物色对象。最近，这个厂又派出十个工作组分赴各地，和同业工厂协商支援问题，检查技术工人的培训工作，以求适应基本建设工程将提前一年半完工的新形势。
