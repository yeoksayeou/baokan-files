Guaranteeing Normal Rest Time for Sales Staff

Changed Work Methods, Customers Satisfied, and Sales Staff are Happy

In order to better serve consumers, the Ganzhou City Trade Company of Jiangxi Province decided to extend business hours from April onwards, based on the specific local situation. However, even before the extension of business hours, they already had to start early and work late every day, with only one day off per week, and did not get adequate rest. Now, with the extension of business hours, the main difficulty is the lack of manpower, making it hard to cope. The Northeast Road Store even proposed to add five people. However, after research at a meeting of the heads of various stores in the company, it was decided that: "To extend business hours, not only should we not increase staff, but we also cannot extend the working hours of the sales staff."

After research by various groups in the stores, everyone unanimously agreed with this approach and proposed implementing a "linked shift system" in each store.

The characteristic of the Northeast Road Store is: busy in the morning, relatively busy at noon, busy in the evening, and only relatively quiet in the late morning and afternoon. After figuring out this pattern, they adjusted the personnel. Among the eleven people in the store (including one person in charge and one bookkeeper), they took turns working in shifts. Starting at 8:00 AM, six people work until 1:00 PM. Four people get off work, and the remaining two people get off at 2:00 PM. At 1:00 PM, another shift of five people starts work and gets off at 10:00 PM. The six sales staff from the morning shift work a second shift from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM as well (two of whom originally got off at 2:00 PM but now get off at 9:00 PM). In this way, there are six people from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, seven people from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, five people from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, eleven people from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and nine people from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM. The person in charge of the store and the bookkeeper can also be mobilized to assist when business is busy. This achieves the requirement of "extending business hours without extending working hours."

After implementing the linked shift system, the Northeast Road Store not only extended the store's business hours and satisfied customers, but also shortened the working hours of the sales staff. This achieves a daily work schedule of eight hours (within the nine hours on duty, there is one hour for rotating meals and breastfeeding time for female comrades), making the sales staff very happy and improving work efficiency.

Afternoon Closing, Evening Rest

In the past, the working hours of sales staff at the Jiamusi City Department Store in Heilongjiang Province were divided into two shifts, but the closing of accounts was always done in the evening. Sales staff who got off work in the afternoon, no matter how far they lived, had to rush back in the evening to close the accounts, so the time that should have been for rest was wasted on traveling back and forth. Now, they have changed to closing the accounts immediately after getting off work in the afternoon and handing them over to the next shift. The next shift takes over the accounts and is responsible for the business of the afternoon and the next morning, and then closes the accounts in the afternoon and hands them over to another shift. This cycle rotates, ensuring the rest time of the sales staff and ensuring clear accounts. (Sun Shenxiao)

Too Many Meetings Deprive Sales Staff of Normal Rest

For a long time, the sales staff of the Xinjiekou State-Owned Retail Store in Beijing have not been able to get enough rest because of too many meetings. Originally, the working hours of the sales staff in this store were eight hours, but in addition to work, there was at least one meeting a day, and sometimes two. Each meeting lasts for a minimum of half an hour and a maximum of three hours, with a more frequent duration of one and a half to two hours. Therefore, they often don't get off work until 10:30 PM, and then continue to meet until 12:00 AM. If there is a meeting the next morning, they have to rush to the store before 6:30 AM. In this way, the actual sleep time each night is only about five hours. From July 1st to 10th, for ten days, except for the 9th, there were meetings every day, and there were two days with two meetings in one day.

These meetings, according to the leaders of the store, are necessary for discussing and studying work. But what is the content of these meetings? Often, it is discussing who gave the customer a few cents too much or too little in change. Sometimes, even when the department head has already been appointed by the higher authorities, everyone has to have a meeting to talk about the department head's name, where he comes from, and whether everyone agrees, etc. Similar things that could be done with a written notice must be discussed in a meeting. Sometimes, even if the content of the meeting is simple and the meeting time is not long, it often takes a lot of time because the preparation before the meeting is not sufficient, and the venue and the person chairing the meeting are found at the last minute.

Recently, the manager of this store said that some meetings could be reduced, but it is still necessary to ensure a minimum of seventeen hours of meetings per month. The manager did not say how much time is the maximum. (Li Keyuan)

Four Years Without a Single Day of Rest

I am a salesperson at a grassroots supply and marketing cooperative in Chongning County, Sichuan Province. I have been working here for almost four years, but I have never had a single day off. Every day after work, I am either in a meeting or going to the countryside to do propaganda work. Therefore, I get up at 6:00 AM every day and can't go to bed until 12:00 AM. During the Spring Festival this year, I asked for a day or two off, but I was criticized by the director of the cooperative, who said, "Do you want to be naughty? I'll settle accounts with you when we summarize the work."

Can our rest problem never be resolved like this? (Xi Ping)

### 保证营业员有正常的休息时间

    保证营业员有正常的休息时间
    改变了工作方法，顾客满意，营业员也高兴
    江西省赣州市贸易公司为了更好的为消费者服务，从四月份起，根据当地的具体情况，决定延长营业时间。可是，在没有延长工作时间的时候，他们除了每星期有一天公休外，每天都要起早摸黑，得不到适当的休息。现在，还要延长营业时间，主要的困难就是人手不够，忙不过来，东北路门市部就提出要增加五个人。可是，在公司各个门市部负责人的会议上，经过研究后认为：“营业时间要延长，不但不能增加人，而且不能延长营业员的工作时间。”
    经过门市部的各小组研究，大家一致同意这样做，同时提出在各个门市部推行连带上班制。
    东北路门市部的特点是：早上忙，中午比较忙，晚上忙，只有上下午比较清闲。大家摸清这个规律后，把人员调整了一下，在门市部的十一个人中（内负责人和记账的各一人）分别轮流上班。早上八时起，六个人上班，工作到下午一时，四个人下班，其余两个人到二时下班；下午一时，另一班五个人上班，到晚十时下班；早上的六个营业员在下午六时又第二次上班，也到十时下班（其中原在二时下班的两人到晚九时下班）。这样，早上八时至下午一时有六个人，一时到二时有七个人，二时到六时有五个人，六时到九时有十一人，九时到十时有九个人。而门市部负责人和记账的同志在营业忙的时候还可机动出来协助。达到了“延长营业时间，不延长工作时间”的要求。
    东北路门市部在实行了连带上班制以后，不但延长了门市营业时间，顾客满意，而且营业员的工作时间反而缩短了。达到了每天工作八小时（在上班的九小时中，有一个小时是轮流吃饭和女同志喂奶时间），使营业员也很高兴，工作效率也得到提高。　（江凡）
    下午结账，晚上休息
    黑龙江省佳木斯市百货公司营业员的工作时间过去虽然分为两班制，但是结账时间都是在晚上。在下午下班的营业员，无论住的地方有多远，都得在晚上赶回来结账，所以应该休息的时间，却浪费在来回跑路上了。现在他们改成下午下班后马上结账，交给下一班；下一班接账后，负责一个下午和次日上午的营业，然后再在下午结账交给另一班。如此轮流循环，既保证了营业员的休息时间，又做到了账目清楚。　（孙慎效）
    会议太多使营业员得不到正常的休息
    北京市新街口国营零售商店的营业员，长期以来，因为会议太多，得不到足够的休息。本来，这个商店的营业员上班的时间是八小时，但是，除工作外，一天至少开一个会，有时还开两个会。开一次会，最短是半小时，长则达三小时，比较经常的是开一个半钟头到两个钟头。所以往往在晚上十点半下班后，一直开到半夜十二点。如果遇到第二天早上有会，又得在清晨六点半以前赶到店里。这样，每晚睡眠的时间实际只有五小时左右。从七月一日到十日的十天中，除九日那天没有开会外，其余都是天天有会，有两天还是一天开两个会。
    这些会，据商店领导同志说，是因为要讨论研究工作，因而不得不开。可是，这些会的内容是什么呢？往往是讨论谁为什么多找或少找给顾客几分钱了；有时明明上级已经任命好了的科长，也要大家开会来谈谈这个科长姓什么，叫什么，从哪里来的，大家是不是同意等。类似这些用书面通知就可以办到的事，却一定要开会来谈。有时即使会议的内容简单，开会的时间不算长，可是常常因为会前准备不充分，临时才找会场和等主持开会的人，所以开一次会，就要花去很多时间。
    最近，这个商店的经理说，可以减少些会议了，但是还要保证一个月最少开十七小时的会；最多要开多少时间呢，经理却没有说。
            （李克远）
    四年没有休息过一天
    我是四川省崇宁县一个基层供销社的售货员，我到这里工作将近四年了，但是从来没有一个休假日。每天下班后，晚上不是开会，就是下乡去作宣传工作，因此每天早上六点钟起床，要到晚上十二点才能睡觉。在今年过春节的时候，我要求休息一两天，就受到社主任的批评，他说：“你想调皮吗？到总结工作时再给你算账。”
    我们的休息问题难道就这样永远不能得到解决吗？　（熙屏）
