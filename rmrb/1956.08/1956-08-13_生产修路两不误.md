    "Balancing Production and Road Construction"
    Liu Pizhong, Yan Youtong, Lu Defang
    Anze County, where transportation is inconvenient, has built a 75-kilometer-long simple highway in accordance with the spirit of "spending less money and building more roads" and "relying on the people and using local materials." It has also relatively properly solved a very important problem in local road construction - not delaying agricultural work, and achieving "balancing production and road construction."
    Anze County, Shanxi Province, is a remote mountainous area with extremely inconvenient transportation. The development of political, economic, and cultural work here is affected to a certain extent.
    Due to the heavy mountains and rivers surrounding it, and the obstruction of north-south transportation, farmers throughout the county have to use considerable labor and animal power to transport coal. According to incomplete statistics, the labor and animal power spent on coal transportation each year amounts to more than 725,000. Moreover, due to inconvenient transportation, transportation is time-consuming and costly, and the selling price is extremely high. Coal in Baofeng Township sells for only 0.24 fen per jin at the place of production, but it sells for 2.5 fen after being transported to Fucheng (the county seat), only 52 kilometers away, a price difference of more than nine times. Especially when it rains and the river water rises sharply, transportation is blocked, and coal is often out of stock in the market, forming a buying panic. The masses reflect: "We are not afraid of the sky, we are not afraid of the earth, we are only afraid of rain and high river water." When it comes to transporting public grain, the road problem also causes endless distress to the masses, who say: "We are not afraid of selling surplus grain, but we are afraid of delivering public grain."
    Here, inconvenient transportation also makes it more difficult to issue government orders. After the county's three-level expanded cadre meeting assigned tasks, work in a few townships closer to the county seat has already started vigorously, while cadres in most townships far from the county seat are still on the road. Once, the county held a women's cadre meeting, and some representatives were unwilling to attend because they were afraid of climbing mountains, crossing rivers, and wading through water. Cadres say: "We are not afraid of heavy work, we are afraid of walking to meetings." As a result, some cadres are unwilling to go to or are not at ease working in mountainous areas. The county also added a consideration when assigning cadres: "Is the body good? Can you walk often?"
    How much impact does Anze County's inconvenient transportation have on cadres, the masses, the work of the Party and the government, and the lives of the people!
    This spring, after the county basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, this backward transportation situation became even more unable to meet the needs of production development. In order to organize a large, high-quality, low-priced, and fast transportation capacity, and to provide convenient transportation conditions for the great development of production after agricultural cooperativization, Anze County began construction this spring of a simple highway running through the north and south of the county, from Jishi Township via Fucheng to Beiping Township, with a total length of 75 kilometers - the Jiping Highway. This is a very large-scale construction project in the history of Anze County. It involves 129,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the roadbed, more than 97,000 cubic meters of stonework for the roadbed, 16 bridges and culverts of various sizes, and 15 dry-laid retaining walls, totaling 498 cubic meters. Calculating only the stonework and bridge and culvert projects, it requires an investment of 130,000 yuan. However, the current national financial situation cannot invest too much in local roads. Therefore, based on the spirit of "spending less money and building more roads" and "relying on the people and using local materials," the entire project is only invested 70,000 yuan by the state, and the rest is solved by local means.
    Although the state's investment is not much, under the leadership of the Anze County Party and government organs, and with the efforts of all employees and the support of the people of the county, the Jiping Highway was finally completed. The subgrade, pavement, and slope and curve of the stone section of the entire earth road meet the design requirements; the bridges, culverts, retaining walls and other buildings are basically solid and durable. In addition, the project cost was greatly reduced, saving more than 48,000 yuan in project expenses.
    In the construction of the Jiping Highway, a significant issue in local road construction was appropriately resolved: How to closely integrate local road construction with production without delaying agricultural tasks. After the basic realization of advanced agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, both production and road construction were crucial, but there were conflicting requirements for labor utilization. Without coordinated planning, mutual interference was inevitable. The Party and government leaders of Anze County studied this situation and decided to adopt the approach of "concentrated road construction during agricultural slack season and intensive production during agricultural busy season" to achieve "balancing production and road construction." They also sought to expand the mobilization scope of migrant workers' attendance, reducing the number of attendees from each township to ensure that, under any circumstances, both the highway project did not cease and agricultural production remained unaffected. For instance, the entire 120,000 cubic meter earthwork project for the roadbed was accomplished during the agricultural slack period before the spring plowing, mobilizing more than 6,300 migrant workers at once, with each person attending an average of five days to complete it. To avoid wasting manpower, the county transferred 44 capable cadres from 13 units to lead the work in sections during this earthwork project. Each worker completed an average of more than 4 cubic meters of earthwork per day, ensuring the timely completion of the earthwork project. After the spring plowing and sowing, the project drew 500 migrant workers during the agricultural slack period before the wheat matured, who worked intensively for 20 days to complete more than 15,000 cubic meters of stonework for the roadbed. During the busy agricultural production stages of summer harvesting and summer hoeing, and in accordance with the principle of not delaying agricultural tasks, in addition to employing 50 members of agricultural production cooperatives in a planned manner, the mobilization range of migrant worker attendance was expanded from one township to 14 townships, with each township attending an average of only 40 people. This ensured both that production was not delayed and that road construction was taken care of.
    While adopting the above-mentioned methods, the specific circumstances of the labor force of each agricultural production cooperative were also taken into consideration for a reasonable allocation. For example, the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative had more labor and less land, and had no other avenues for sideline production, and was struggling to deal with the surplus labor. It was treated as the main object of employing labor for the road construction project. The Lingjing Agricultural Production Cooperative, on the other hand, had less labor and more land. Although some members had already participated in road construction, when the autumn seedlings in the community were washed away by the water, the construction site office immediately mobilized them to return to the community to support the seedlings and replant them.
    Anze County adopted two methods to handle the wage issue of the members of various agricultural production cooperatives who were hired to participate in road construction. One method was "wages returned to the cooperative, work points recorded within the cooperative," and the other was "wages returned to the individual, sufficient rations retained within the cooperative, and individuals paid to purchase [extra supplies]." Each of these two methods has its own advantages, and the road-building members chose which method to use to calculate remuneration.
    Using the strength of one county to build roads, even simple roads, the technical force is also a major issue. In this year's local road engineering, Anze County, like other counties, deeply felt that the task was heavy, the experience was lacking, and the technical force was insufficient. However, the leadership realized that it was impossible to rely on higher-level agencies to equip them with sufficient technical personnel, and they adopted the method of tapping local potential to solve this problem. After in-depth investigation and research, they first transferred a regimental-level demobilized cadre from the county's cotton yarn and cloth company who had served as a tank and automobile instructor in the army and had experience in road construction. Later, they hired a rural technician who had worked in the railway department for surveying and design and a demobilized soldier who had served as a sapper in the army. In addition, they equipped some cadres who were familiar with the county's geographical conditions to form the Jiping Highway survey and design team, which completed the survey and design work. After review, except for correcting some unreasonable project items, there were generally not many discrepancies.
    The source of bridge-building technicians and mountain opening workers was also a problem. Anze County selected some comrades who had made "stone mine" devices during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression as the backbone of the mountain opening workers. More than 30 skilled stonemasons, tilers, and plasterers were drawn from various townships as the backbone of the bridge-building workers, and a group of relatively skilled migrant workers were trained using the method of masters leading apprentices.
    Due to the attention paid to tapping the potential of local talents and the attention paid to technical training, not only was the needs of this highway construction met, but also the enthusiasm of the migrant workers was greatly improved. Many members of agricultural production cooperatives said: "This road construction was not long, but we learned a lot of skills." After these people mastered the technology, they laid the foundation for future local road construction projects.
    The Jiping Highway was able to be built quickly and "balancing production and road construction" was achieved, which is inseparable from the county's leadership's attention to this work and the relatively strict organization of the entire project. In order to strengthen the leadership of this project, the "Transportation Committee" was formed by seven responsible comrades from the county Party committee, the Communist Youth League committee, the People's Committee, and public security, transportation, civil affairs, health and other departments. There was an office at the construction site, full-time cadres at the work sections, and the organization of migrant workers into classes and teams. There were certain systems for planning work, technical work, and safety work to ensure the order of the construction project.
    From the construction of the Jiping Highway in Anze County, we can see how high the enthusiasm of the masses is for building roads and improving transportation conditions. This enthusiasm is the most valuable force for developing local transportation. When the farmers of Anze County realized the benefits of building the Jiping Highway for the country and for themselves, they scrambled to sign up for road construction, setting off a wave of road construction. For the earthwork project before spring plowing and sowing, the original plan was to mobilize only more than 4,000 migrant workers, but more than 6,000 people came. At that time, the wind and snow were very heavy, and three elderly women had to rush to the construction site five miles away to participate in road construction. The cadres did not allow them to go, but they insisted: "Everyone's road, everyone builds, we must go." An old man named Huang Fucai in Sanjiao Village, who was 73 years old, also asked to participate in road construction. After the cadres persuaded him again and again with thousands of words, he agreed not to go; but after thinking about it, he was still unwilling, so he led his daughter-in-law to plant more than 130 street trees on both sides of the highway, and proposed "guarantee planting, guarantee survival, and guarantee becoming timber."

    “生产修路两不误”
    柳丕忠　阎有通　卢德芳
    交通不便的安泽县根据“少花钱，多修路”和“依靠民力，就地取材”的精神，修建了一条长达七十五公里的简易公路，并且比较妥善地解决了地方道路建设中一个很重要的问题——不误农时，做到“生产修路两不误”。
    山西省安泽县是个偏僻的山区，交通极为不便。无论是政治工作，经济工作和文化工作的开展，在这里都受到一定的影响。
    由于山河重重环绕，南北交通的阻隔，全县农民不得不用相当大的劳力、畜力去运输煤炭。据不完全的统计，每年花费于煤炭运输上的劳力、畜力即达七十二万五千多个，而且由于交通不便，运输费时费事，售价极高。宝丰乡的煤在产地每斤只卖二厘四，运到府城（县城），只五十二公里，就要卖二分五，价格相差九倍以上。特别是每逢天雨河水暴涨，交通堵塞，市场煤炭经常脱销，形成抢购。群众反映说：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕下雨河水大”。到了运送公粮时，道路问题也给群众无限的苦恼，他们说：不怕卖余粮，但怕送公粮”。
    这里的交通不便，政令下达也比较困难。县的三级扩大干部会议布置任务之后，少数离县城较近的乡，工作已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来，大多数乡离县城较远，干部还在路上走呢。有一次县里开妇女干部会议，有些代表就因为怕翻山越岭，涉河过水，不愿来参加。干部们说：“不怕工作繁重，就怕开会走路”。有些干部因此不愿意到或不安心在山区工作。县里配备干部也多了一条考虑：“身体好不好，能不能经常走路？”
    安泽县的交通不便，给干部、给群众、给党和政府的工作、给人民的生活，带来多么大的影响啊！
    今年春季，全县基本上实现了高级农业合作化之后，这种落后的交通面貌更显得不能满足生产发展的需要了。为了组织量大、质好、价廉、快速的运输能力，给农业合作化之后的生产大发展提供便利的交通条件，安泽县今年春天开始动工修建了一条从冀氏乡经府城到北平乡，全长七十五公里，贯穿全县南北的简易公路——冀平公路。这是安泽县有史以来一项规模十分巨大的建筑工程。计有路基土方十二万九千立方公尺，路基石方九万七千多立方公尺，大小桥涵十六座，干砌护墙十五处，计四百九十八立方公尺。仅以其中的石方和桥涵两项工程计算，就需投资十三万元。但是目前国家的财政状况还不可能对地方道路投资过多，因此，本着“少花钱、多修路”和“依靠民力、就地取材”的精神，全部工程只由国家投资七万元，其余由地方设法解决。
    虽然国家投资不多，但在安泽县党、政机关的领导下，在全体职工的努力和全县群众的支援下，冀平公路终于修成了。全线土路的路基、路面和石方地段的坡度、弯道，都达到设计要求；桥涵、护墙等建筑物基本上也是坚固耐用的。另外，还大大降低了工程造价，节省了四万八千多元工程费用。
    在冀平公路的建设中，比较妥善地解决了一个地方道路建设中的重要问题：这就是地方道路的建设如何紧密结合生产，不误农时。在全县基本上实现了高级农业合作化之后，生产和修路都很重要，但在使用劳动力上却存在着矛盾，如不统一安排，势必互有影响。安泽县党、政领导机关研究了这个情况，决定采取“农暇突击修路，农忙集中生产”的办法，做到“生产修路两不误”；并且设法扩大民工出勤的动员范围，减少每一个乡的出勤人数，保证了在任何情况下，公路工程既不停工，农业生产也没有受到影响。如全线十二万立方公尺的路基土方工程，就是利用春耕前的一段农闲空隙，一次动员了六千三百多个民工，平均每人出勤五天突击完成的；为了不浪费民力，在这次路基土方工程中，县里从十三个单位抽调了四十四个得力干部，分段领导，每工每日平均完成土方四立方公尺多，保证了土方工程按期完成。春耕播种后，又利用小麦尚未成熟的一段农暇空隙，抽调了五百个民工，突击了二十天，完成路基石方一万五千多立方公尺。在夏收、夏锄的农事生产紧张阶段，根据不误农时的原则，除有计划地雇用了五十个农业生产合作社的社员外，并把民工建勤的动员范围从一个乡扩大到十四个乡，每个乡平均只出勤四十多人。这样既不耽误生产，又照顾了修路。
    在采用上述办法的同时，还根据各农业生产合作社劳力多寡的具体情况，合理进行调配。如和平农业生产合作社劳力多，土地少，又没有其他副业生产门路，正苦于剩余劳力无法处理，就把它当成修路工程雇用劳力的主要对象。岭荆农业生产合作社则是劳力少，土地
  多，虽然有些社员已经参加修路工作；但当社内秋苗被水冲毁后，工地办公室就立即动员他们回社扶苗补种。
    被雇来参加修路的各个农业生产合作社社员的工资问题，安泽县采用两种办法来处理。一种是“工资归社，社内记工”，一种是“工资归自己，社内留足口粮，个人出钱购买”。这两种办法各有好处，由筑路社员自己选择采用那种办法计算报酬。
    以一县的力量，来修建公路，那怕是简易公路，技术力量也是个大问题。在今年的地方道路工程中，安泽县和其它各县一样，深感任务繁重，经验缺乏，技术力量不足。但是，领导上认识到依靠上级机关配备足够的技术人员是不可能的，他们采用了挖掘地方潜力的办法来解决这个问题。经过深入调查研究，首先从县花纱布公司抽调了一个原在部队担任过坦克和汽车教官、对于修建道路有经验的营级转业干部，后来又雇用了一个原来在铁路部门作过测量设计工作的在乡技术人员和一个曾在部队担任过工兵的复员军人，另外又配备了一些熟悉本县地理情况的干部，组成了冀平公路勘测设计小组，完成了勘测设计工作。经过审查，除了核正一些不合理的工程项目外，一般还没有多大出入。
    建桥技工和开山工的来源也是一个问题，安泽县选拔了一些在抗日战争时期作过“石雷”装置的同志，作为开山工人的骨干。从各乡抽调了三十多个技术较高的石、瓦、泥水工匠，作为建桥工人的骨干，又用师傅带徒弟的办法培养了一批技术比较熟练的民工。
    由于注意了挖掘地方人才的潜力，注意了技术培养工作，不仅满足了这条公路建设的需要，而且大大提高了民工的积极性。许多农业生产合作社的社员说：“这次修路，时间不长，本事学了不少。”这些人掌握了技术之后，就给今后的地方道路修建工程打下了基础。
    冀平公路能够很快地修建成功，并且做到“生产修路两不误”，是同县的领导上重视这项工作，整个工程的进行有比较严密的组织分不开的。为了加强对这项工程的领导，由县党委、团委、人民委员会和公安、交通、民政、卫生等部门的七个负责同志组成了“交通委员会”。工地有办公室，工段有专职干部，民工有班和队的组织，计划工作、技术工作、安全工作都有一定的制度，保证了建筑工程的秩序。
    从安泽县修建冀平公路中，可以看到群众修建道路、改善交通状况的热情是多么高。这种热情，正是发展地方交通事业最宝贵的力量。当安泽县农民认识到修建冀平公路对国家、对自己的好处之后，争先恐后地报名修路，掀起了修路的热潮。春耕播种前的土方工程，原计划只动员民工四千多人，结果却来了六千多人。那时风雪很大，有三个年老的妇女非要赶到五里路以外的工地参加修路不可，干部不让她们去，她们却坚持说：“大家的路，大家修，我们一定要去。”三交村有个七十三岁的黄福财老汉，也要求参加修路，经过干部千言万语再三劝阻，才答应不去；但想想，还是不甘心，便领了儿媳妇在公路两旁栽了一百三十多株行道树，并提出“保栽、保活、保成材”。
