According to a report in the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, Mr. Shang Yanliu, an eighty-three-year-old man who was a "Tanhua" (third place) in the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu period, is braving the summer heat to write a 200,000-word work entitled "A Record of Qing Dynasty Imperial Examinations."

Two years ago, Mr. Shang felt that our country lacked a systematic work on the examination system. As material on the "examination system," a tool of the feudal ruling class, it would be of reference value for historians studying the development of society, politics, and culture. He thought that there were very few people left who had experienced the imperial examinations, so he decided to use his remaining years to write.

In order to complete this work, the old gentleman often takes a car to the Nanjing Library and the Nanjing University Library to find books, and he has read more than a hundred kinds of reference books. He devotes all his energy to writing. After the first draft was completed, he asked thirty old gentlemen for their opinions, and sent the first draft to old friends in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou for research. The first draft was revised again and again, and the thick volume has been written over five times.

    八十三岁老人商衍鎏在写“清代科举考试述录”
    据南京新华日报报道　清代光绪年间“探花”、八十三岁老人商衍鎏先生，冒着夏天的炎热，正在写一部长达二十万字的著作“清代科举考试述录”。
    两年前，商老先生感到我国缺少一部系统讲述考试制度的著作，而作为封建统治阶级统治工具的“考试制度”的材料，对于历史学家研究社会政治、文化的发展是有参考意义的。他想，历经科举考试的人已寥寥无几，因此决意利用自己的晚年时光进行写作。
    老先生为了完成这一著述，常坐车到南京图书馆和南京大学图书馆寻找藏书，他已前后阅读了一百多种参考书。他把全部精力都贯注于著述工作。初稿完成后，曾先后要求三十位老先生提出意见，并把初稿寄给远在北京、上海、广州的老朋友研究，初稿一次又一次修改，厚厚一本已写过五遍。
