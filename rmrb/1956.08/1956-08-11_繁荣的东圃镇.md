    Prosperous Dongpu Town
    Xinhua News Agency reporter He Xing
    On August 3rd, two farmer customers came to Dongpu Town, a suburb of Guangzhou. The father and son went through several cloth shops in the town, looked at many cloth samples, but always felt that the materials were not good enough. Finally, they went into the Jianxin Cotton Cloth Cooperative Store and took a fancy to a kind of Qingyun gauze. The father cut five meters for his son, which could be used to make a whole set of clothes, priced at 20 yuan and 6 jiao.
    The day before, this cloth shop sold about 400 meters of cloth, and the main customers were farmers. The staff in the shop told reporters that now farmers are buying more clothing materials, and they also demand better quality. This situation was rare in the past. Those cheap goods with simple patterns and poor quality are no longer popular.
    The Department Store Wholesale Department and retail outlet of the Huangpu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, located in the town, has not only seen a significant increase in turnover this year, but also many goods that were originally slow-moving are now bestsellers. Small bottles of cologne, hair wax, abacuses, and newspaper clips have all sold unexpectedly well in recent months. Twenty-one-hole harmonicas, priced at seven or eight jiao apiece, were bought by sixty elementary school students in one day. Sales of printed cloth have more than doubled compared to the same period last year.
    The three shops in the town that deal in chicks and ducklings used to have to send people to the countryside to find sales outlets at this time of year, and also had to lower prices to sell; this year, customers have come to the door one after another, requesting large orders, and supply is falling short of demand. The turnover of these three shops in the second quarter of this year has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year.
    Dongpu Town is the central market for nearly ten townships in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, and its prosperity reflects the economic changes in the nearby rural areas. Because agricultural cooperation was fully realized in the suburbs of Guangzhou this spring, vegetables and early rice have generally had bumper harvests, and farmers' incomes have increased significantly. For example, the Tangxia Township Agricultural Cooperative, not far from the town, recently began its summer harvest pre-distribution, with a total distribution value of 130,000 yuan. 95% of the 700-plus households in the cooperative have seen a significant increase in income.

    繁荣的东圃镇
    新华社记者　河星
    八月三日，广州市郊区东圃镇来了两个农民顾客。他们是父子俩人，跑遍了镇上几间布店，看了很多布样，却总嫌那些料子不够好。最后他们跑进了建新棉布合作商店，看中了一种轻云纱。父亲给儿子剪了五公尺，可以裁制一整套衣服，价钱是二十元零六角。
    前一天，这布店卖出了约四百公尺的布料，主顾都是农民。店里的工作人员对记者说，现在农民来买衣料，数量既多而且质料也要求好。这种情况过去是少有的。那些花色简单、质料较差的便宜货色已经不受欢迎了。
    设在镇上的黄埔区供销合作社百货批发部和零售门市部，今年不仅营业额显著增加，许多原来滞销的货品现在都成了畅销货。小瓶装的花露水、发腊、算盘和报纸木夹等，这几个月来都出乎意外地好销。七、八角钱一支的二十一孔口琴，竟在一天内给小学生买去了六十个。花布比去年同期多销了一倍。
    镇上三家经营小鸡、小鸭的店，往年这时候除派人下乡找销路外，还不得不降价出售；今年顾客们纷纷找上门来，要求大批定货，供不应求。这三家店今年第二季度营业额，比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    东圃镇是广州市东郊近十个乡的中心市场，它的繁荣反映了附近农村的经济变化。由于今年春天广州市郊区全部实现了农业合作化，蔬菜和早稻等普遍丰收，农民的收入增加很多。例如离镇不远的棠下乡农业社最近开始夏收预分，分配总值达十三万元，全社七百多户中95％显著地增加了收入。
