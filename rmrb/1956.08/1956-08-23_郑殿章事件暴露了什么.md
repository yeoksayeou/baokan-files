What the Zheng Dianzhang Incident Reveals

The “Zhang Shunyou Incident” of four years ago exposed the serious bureaucracy in some of our agencies. Now, the incident of revolutionary disabled soldier Zheng Dianzhang being refused and persecuted when applying for a replacement disability certificate exposes the seriousness of bureaucracy to an even greater extent. In all the agencies involved in this incident, from some central departments to local organs, an intolerable bureaucratic style was demonstrated.

The fact that revolutionary disabled soldier Zheng Dianzhang lost his disability certificate and requested a replacement was originally a very simple matter. Based on the evidence provided by Zheng Dianzhang, the problem could have been completely resolved by simply checking the past transfer introduction letters and stubs for receiving disability payments in the archives of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau. However, encountering an irresponsible cadre like Li Jinghua, encountering a section chief like He Tong who deliberately made things difficult and acted as a tyrant, as well as a series of bureaucratic practices in relevant agencies, complicated the problem. In order to obtain a replacement disability certificate, Zheng Dianzhang went to Central South China three times and entered Beijing five times in the past five years, spending nearly two and a half years in detention and imprisonment, and experiencing much hardship and suffering!

What issues does this incident expose? What lessons should be learned from this incident?

We often say "serve the people." As for the Preferential Treatment Section of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau, its specific service targets are those revolutionary fighters who shed blood and were wounded on the battlefield, and then demobilized, as well as the families of all revolutionary soldiers. However, some staff members of the Preferential Treatment Section not only failed to actively and conscientiously perform their duties, but instead used their authority to create difficulties for demobilized soldiers in every possible way, causing them pain. When Zheng Dianzhang questioned these difficulties, they thought it was an offense to their dignity and retaliated against Zheng Dianzhang with even more despicable means. They consciously refused to acknowledge the unit certificate that Zheng Dianzhang had obtained with great difficulty and refused to implement the correct instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to them. They tried their best to find Zheng Dianzhang's "bad deeds" and create so-called "basis for sentencing." This is their attitude towards a demobilized soldier who was wounded and shed blood in the revolutionary war! He Tong, as the chief of the Preferential Treatment Section, openly said to Zheng Dianzhang: "You go to Central South China, you go to Beijing, whether your problem is solved or not, I am still the section chief!" People can hear how vicious this voice is and see what a hideous face it is! In our country, all cadres are servants of the people and should honestly serve the people. Anyone who tries to act as a master of the people, oppressing and persecuting the people, will surely be spurned and even punished by the people! He Tong is naturally no longer the section chief, and other cadres of the Preferential Treatment Section and the Civil Affairs Bureau who participated in this incident have also made self-criticisms or been punished. However, they should not only accept punishment and conduct self-criticism; they should carefully think about how glorious and great the task they are undertaking is, and how shameful their mistakes are! They must thoroughly understand what the difference is between being a staff member of a state organ in New China and being a corrupt official in the old society!

We often say that we should care about the suffering of the masses, but when we really encounter the suffering of the masses, some people are not responsible for solving it, but instead go along with the current and try to get rid of the matter. The reason why Zheng Dianzhang's problem has been delayed for as long as five years, in addition to the direct reason that figures like He Tong deliberately created difficulties and attacked him, the relevant cadres of the more than ten agencies that Zheng Dianzhang contacted shirking responsibility and ignoring the suffering of the masses cannot be said to be an important reason. These more than ten agencies include the former Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Supervision, etc. The relevant cadres in these more than ten agencies seem to be skilled "shirking experts," irresponsibly pushing back and forth an incident that affects the honor and life of a disabled soldier, and no one seriously investigates it. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China once handed over Zheng Dianzhang's complaint to the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau for handling. However, when the Civil Affairs Bureau did not handle it, the Municipal Committee stopped asking about it. Similarly, the Preferential Treatment Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs once instructed He Tong to "handle Zheng Dianzhang's problem as soon as possible"; however, after the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau reported that "Zheng Dianzhang's character was bad," the Preferential Treatment Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs believed without any doubt that Zheng Dianzhang was "impersonating a disabled soldier" and withdrew its support for him. Under such circumstances, Zheng Dianzhang was introduced to the Ministry of Supervision by the staff of the State Council. In principle, the Ministry of Supervision should exercise its supervisory power over such matters! But no, Zheng Dianzhang was "pushed out" again by the staff of the Ministry of Supervision. It can be seen from this how widespread this irresponsible shirk-responsibility style is! How seriously this style harms our work!

Judging from the fact that Zheng Dianzhang was unreasonably detained several times, the phenomenon of unseriousness in the execution of laws is quite serious. Many cadres often punish some people who superficially have shortcomings or mistakes without asking the reason. For example, Zheng Dianzhang was found by comrades in the army for wearing a military uniform without proof and was sent to the Military Law Department of the former Central South Military Region for handling. The comrades in the Military Law Department did check with the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau about this matter, but they still detained Zheng Dianzhang for eight months (although they later actively assisted Zheng Dianzhang in solving the problem of reissuing the disability certificate, which should be commended). For example, Zheng Dianzhang was "reformed through labor" for eight months because he did not pay for his meals, which was also completely inappropriate. Meals should be paid for; however, no one was willing to understand why Zheng Dianzhang did not pay. One meal, eight months of "labor reform," when did our country formulate such a "law"? It should be made clear to those who punish people arbitrarily that if anyone abuses their power and harms the people, they should bear the legal responsibility they should bear.

This incident has once again sounded the alarm for us, showing how deeply rooted bureaucracy, this bad thing left over from the old era, is! We hope that through this incident, all relevant agencies can truly strengthen cadre education, improve their work style, and take various effective measures to eliminate all similar incidents. This is not only a matter concerning the vital interests of demobilized soldiers, but also a matter concerning the vital interests between our Party and the government and the broad masses of the people. These abhorrent incidents must be eliminated so that our Party and government can more closely unite the masses around them, successfully realize construction plans in all aspects, and effectively defeat all overt or covert conspiracies of the enemy!

### 郑殿章事件暴露了什么

    郑殿章事件暴露了什么
    四年以前的“张顺有事件”，曾经暴露了我们某些机关中严重的官僚主义。现在，革命残废军人郑殿章申请补发残废证而遭到拒绝和迫害的事件，在更大的程度上暴露了官僚主义的严重。在这个事件所涉及的所有机关中，从中央的一些部门到地方机关，都表现了不能容忍的官僚主义作风。
    革命残废军人郑殿章遗失了残废证，要求补发，本来是一件很简单的事。根据郑殿章提出的证据，只要在沈阳市民政局的档案里查看一下过去的转移介绍信和领取残废金的存根，就可以完全解决问题。可是，遇着了像李景华这样不负责任的干部，遇着了像贺统这样故意刁难、作威作福的科长，以及有关机关一系列的官僚主义作风，问题就复杂化了。为了补领残废证，五年来，郑殿章曾经三次到中南，五次进北京，在扣押和监禁中度过近两年半的时光，尝受了多少颠沛流离的痛苦！
    这个事件暴露了一些什么问题呢？通过这个事件应当接受一些什么教训呢？
    我们常说为人民服务，以沈阳市民政局优抚科来说，它所服务的具体对象就是那些曾经在战场上流过血、负过伤、以后又复员的革命战士以及一切革命军人的家属。可是，优抚科的一些工作人员不但没有积极认真地履行自己的职责，反而利用自己的职权对复员军人百般刁难，给复员军人制造痛苦。当郑殿章对这些刁难提出质问的时候，他们就以为这是冒犯了自己的尊严，就以更卑劣的手段打击郑殿章。他们有意识地拒绝承认郑殿章费了千辛万苦找来的部队证明，拒绝执行内务部对他们的正确指示。他们极力寻找郑殿章的“劣迹”，制造所谓“判刑根据”。这就是他们对待一个在革命战争中负过伤、流过血的复员军人的态度！身为优抚科科长的贺统，竟然公开地对郑殿章说：“你上中南上北京，你的问题没有解决还是没有解决，我科长还是科长吧！”人们可以听得出这是一种多么凶恶的声音，可以看得到这是一副多么狰狞的面孔！在我们国家里，一切干部都是人民的勤务员，都应当老老实实地为人民服务。谁要企图充当人民的老爷，欺压和迫害人民，谁就一定会受到人民的唾弃以至惩罚！贺统现在自然已经不是科长了，参与这个事件的优抚科和民政局其他一些干部也已经做了检讨或受了处分，但是他们不应该止于接受处分，进行检讨；他们应该仔细想想他们所担负的是多么光荣伟大的任务，而自己所犯的错误却又是多么可耻的一种错误！他们必须彻底弄清楚，作一个新中国的国家机关工作人员，与在旧社会里做一个臭官僚有什么不同！
    我们常说要关心群众疾苦，可是真正遇到群众疾苦的时候，有些人并不负责解决，而是顺水推舟，推出了事。郑殿章的问题所以拖延达五年之久，除了贺统之类的人物故意刁难打击这个直接原因之外，郑殿章所接触的十几个机关的有关干部遇事推诿和漠视群众疾苦，不能不说是重要原因。这十几个机关包括前沈阳市人民政府、中共沈阳市委员会以及内务部、监察部等。这十几个机关中的有关干部，好像都是熟练的“推诿专家”，把一个影响残废军人荣誉和生活的事件完全不负责任地推来推去，谁也不去认真查究。中共沈阳市委曾将郑殿章的申诉交给沈阳市民政局处理，但是，当民政局不加处理的时候，市委会就不再过问了。同样，内务部优抚局曾经指示贺统“从速处理”郑殿章的问题；但是，当沈阳市民政局报告“郑殿章品质恶劣”以后，内务部优抚局也就毫不怀疑地深信郑殿章是“冒充残废军人”，撤销对他的支持了。在这种情况下，郑殿章被国务院的工作人员介绍到监察部。按道理说，对这样的事情，监察部应当行使它的监察权力了吧！但是不然，郑殿章又被监察部的工作人员“推”出来了。从这里可以看到，这种不负责任的推诿作风是多么普遍！这种作风是多么严重地危害了我们的工作！
    从郑殿章几次被无理扣押的事情看来，执行法律方面的不严肃现象是相当严重的。不少的干部往往是不问情由地惩办一些表面有缺点或错误的人。比如，郑殿章因为穿军服没有证明，被部队的同志发现了，押送到前中南军区军法处处理。军法处的同志固然为这件事向沈阳民政局进行了查对，可是仍然将郑殿章扣押了八个月之久（虽然，后来他们积极协助郑殿章解决补发残废证的问题，是应当表扬的）。再比如，郑殿章因为吃饭没有付钱，就被“劳动改造”了八个月，这也是完全不应当发生的。吃饭应当付钱；但是，郑殿章为什么不付钱，谁也不愿了解。一顿饭钱，八个月的“劳动改造”，我们的国家什么时候制定过这样的“法律”？应当向这些随意惩办人的人讲清楚，谁如果滥用权力，危害人民，谁就应当负起他应负的法律责任。
    这个事件又一次向我们敲起警钟，它说明官僚主义这种从旧时代遗留下来的恶劣东西是如何的根深蒂固！我们希望通过这个事件，一切有关机关都能够确实加强干部教育，改进工作作风，并采取各种有效措施，消除一切类似的事件。这不仅是有关复员军人切身利害的问题，也是有关我们党和政府同广大人民群众之间切身利害的问题。必须消除了这类可恶的事件，我们的党和政府才能更加紧密地把群众团结在自己的周围，胜利地实现各方面的建设计划，并且有力地击败敌人一切或明或暗的阴谋破坏活动！
