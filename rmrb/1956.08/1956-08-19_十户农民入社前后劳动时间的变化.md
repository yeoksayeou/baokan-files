Changes in Labor Time Before and After Ten Farming Households Joined the Cooperative
Pan Shubin, Shan Xiongfei

To understand how farmers allocate their labor time before and after joining the cooperative, we recently conducted a survey of ten members of the Sanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanyang Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province. Among these ten households, two were old upper-middle peasant households, two were old lower-middle peasant households, three were new lower-middle peasant households, and three were poor peasant households, totaling forty-six people and fourteen full laborers (including women, whose half labor is converted). Last year, seven households were members of mutual aid teams, and three were individual households. All ten households joined the cooperative last winter and participated in collective production in January this year.

Labor Time Allocation Before Joining the Cooperative

We first investigated and calculated the overall labor time allocation of the fourteen laborers in these ten households in the year before joining the cooperative (last year), as well as the general situation of each full laborer's time allocation.

These fourteen laborers spent a total of 3,920 days actually participating in labor last year. Each laborer worked an average of 280 days, accounting for a little less than 77% of the total time of the year (calculated as 365 days, same below). Of these 280 days, the number of days spent on agricultural production accounted for 68%, the number of days spent on sideline production accounted for 17.8%, and the number of days spent on household chores accounted for 14.2%.

In addition to these 280 days of labor time, there were 85 days. Of these 85 days, 40 days were lost due to rain and snow, 20 days were lost due to weddings, funerals, or illness, and another 25 days were rest time. Some people rested completely, while others used this time to visit relatives and friends.

Based on the different economic and labor situations of each household, we divided these ten households into four types to see how they allocated their time.

One type is households with more land, strong labor, and relatively wealthy economies. They spend less time working throughout the year and have more free time. There are two households of this type. For example, Zhuo Raofang's household has five people, fifteen mu of land, two full laborers, and one auxiliary laborer, and they labored a total of 454 days throughout the year. Calculated on the basis of two laborers, each laborer spent 227 days on agricultural, sideline, and household labor. The remaining 138 days, in addition to being lost due to rain and snow, were all used for visiting relatives and resting.

Another type is households with more land, insufficient labor, and a generally good life. They spend more time working. There are three households of this type. For example, Yu Xiangyu's household has three people and ten mu of land. Only one person is the main laborer, and his wife is also a bit ill. He has to work 320 days a year. When things are busy during the agricultural season, the mutual aid team also helped him with twelve workdays. Many household chores are done by getting up early and working late to make the most of the time. His non-production time is only 45 days a year, and his labor is relatively intensive.

Another type is households with little land and a lot of labor. Their labor time is more than the first type of household and less than the second type of household. They spend more time on sideline occupations than on agriculture. There are four households of this type. For example, Zhuo Youfan's household has three people and only 2.6 mu of land. He is a strong laborer and works 237 days a year. Among them, agricultural labor is only 50 days, sideline labor is 132 days, and household labor is 55 days. His sideline income accounts for 56% of his total annual income.

One type is households with weak labor, not much land, many people, and a heavy burden of life. They do not work much throughout the year. Among them, the proportion of agricultural and sideline labor is small, and the proportion of household labor is large. There is only one household of this type. For example, Zheng Deshun's household has seven people and more than five mu of land, and he himself is a semi-laborer. He only works 140 days a year. Among them, only 25 days are used for agriculture, 35 days for sideline occupations, and 80 days for household chores. There are also more than 220 days of time that is wasted helplessly because there is nothing to do. His life is very difficult.

We also focused on investigating the household labor situation of farmers. The local farmers' household labor includes collecting firewood, processing rice, growing vegetables, carrying water, and going to market occasionally. According to calculations, a family of five normally needs 80 to 85 days of household labor time each year. A family of three needs about 60 days. The custom here is that household labor is generally more in the winter and spring seasons, while in the summer and autumn seasons, only some vegetables are grown, and the main energy is spent on agriculture and sideline occupations. Calculating the household labor time required by the above-mentioned ten farming households on average, each household needs an average of 82 days, and each laborer needs an average of 58 and a half days.

Changes After Joining the Cooperative

After these ten farming households joined the cooperative, in the 180 days of the first half of this year, excluding 18 days lost due to rain and snow, each laborer worked an average of 153 days out of the remaining 162 days, and only 9 days were free time. Among these 153 days, collective agricultural labor occupies the main position, with a total of 133 days, an increase of 36 days compared with the same period last year (the average agricultural labor per laborer from January to June last year was 97 days). The labor used for family sideline occupations has decreased from an average of more than 27 days per laborer in the same period last year to about 10 days, and household labor has also decreased from an average of a little more than 19 days per laborer last year to a little more than 10 days.

The above figures show that the allocation of labor time has undergone great changes after farmers joined the cooperative: the time spent on collective agricultural production has increased, while the time spent on individual family sideline occupations and household labor has been greatly reduced.

Members' Demands

After the implementation of collective management and the change of production relations, the increase in labor attendance rate and agricultural labor are inevitable. However, under the current circumstances, is it necessary to squeeze the family sideline occupations and household labor time of the members so tightly? Do the members still have practical difficulties? We interviewed several members about this issue. The members indeed have many opinions on this issue. They believe that it is right to work more and spend more labor on agriculture, but the cooperative has not given appropriate time for the personal affairs that members must do. Yu Xiangyu's family has no firewood to burn and needs to take some time to collect firewood, but the cooperative's farm work is arranged very tightly, and there is no time to collect firewood. The couple often quarrel about this. Four other households among these ten households often have to go to the street (twelve li away) to buy vegetables. Five households requested that they be able to take some time to do some household chores and carry out appropriate family sideline production, but these requests have not been well resolved by the cooperative.

We also discussed this issue with several leaders of the cooperative. They admitted that they were squeezing the members too tightly on labor time. Their reasons are three: First, collective production, with many people and great strength, can show the superiority of the agricultural cooperative; Second, collective production can increase income, and members' private sideline production cannot increase the cooperative's income; Third, if time is arranged for members to engage in private sideline production, then they will become individual households again and will "develop capitalism." Therefore, in the three months of April, May, and June, they tightly arranged all the members' time within the scope of collective production.

After we patiently studied with them, they also believed that it was appropriate to arrange some time for the members. The previous squeeze was too tight because they had the above-mentioned views and concerns in their minds. In fact, they also knew that the members needed a certain amount of time to engage in household labor and family sideline production.

Specific Suggestions

After we analyzed the survey materials, we discussed with the members and cooperative cadres once again to study how to solve this problem. Everyone unanimously believed that in the course of a year, except for time lost due to rain and snow, each full laborer should be given about two months of time to be freely allocated by them. In this way, it will neither delay the cooperative's collective production, nor will the members feel that the cooperative is squeezing them too tightly and they are not free. They can do some family sideline occupations, household labor, and other affairs according to their own needs, and they can also rest appropriately. In terms of the arrangement of personal time, the members requested that more time be arranged in the winter and spring seasons, and less time in the summer and autumn seasons. They believe that if the cooperative can make overall plans and specific arrangements to ensure that each member household has a certain amount of time that they can freely allocate, it will be beneficial and harmless to both the collective and the individual members.

### 十户农民入社前后劳动时间的变化

    十户农民入社前后劳动时间的变化
    潘曙斌　单雄飞
    为了了解农民在入社前后劳动时间的支配情况，最近我们在湖南省平江县三阳乡三宝农业生产合作社对十户社员作了一次调查。这十户社员，有两户是老上中农，两户老下中农，三户新下中农，三户贫农，共计四十六口人，十四个全劳动力（妇女半劳动力折合在内）。去年有七户是互助组员，三户是单干户。这十户都是去年冬季入社，今年一月参加集体生产的。
    入社前劳动时间支配情况
    我们首先调查和计算这十户社员中十四个劳动力在入社前一年（去年一年）时间支配的总的情况和每个全劳动力支配自己时间的一般情况。
    这十四个劳动力，去年全年实际参加劳动的时间共有三千九百二十天，每个劳动力平均劳动二百八十天，占全年时间（按三百六十五天计，下同）的77％弱。这二百八十天，用于农业生产的天数占68％，用于副业生产的天数占17.8％，用于家务劳动的占14.2％。
    除了这二百八十天劳动时间以外，还有八十五天的时间。这八十五天，有四十天时间因下雨下雪不能出工，有二十天时间因办理婚、丧事件或因疾病等不得不误工，另有二十五天的时间是休息时间。有的人完全休息，有的人也利用这个时间走亲访友。
    根据各户不同的经济和劳动力的情况，我们在这十户中，又划分四种类型，看他们是怎样支配自己的时间的。
    一种是田地多、劳力强、经济比较富裕的户，他们全年从事劳动的时间要少一些，自由支配的时间要多一些。这种类型户有两户。如卓饶方五口人，十五亩田地，有两个全劳动力和一个辅助劳动力，全年劳动四百五十四天。如以两个劳动力计算，每个劳动力从事农、副业、家务等劳动的时间有二百二十七天，另有一百三十八天的时间，除因雨雪误工以外，全部用于走亲戚和休息。
    一种是田地多、劳动力不足，生活一般还好的户，他们从事劳动时间比较长，这种类型户有三户。如余项雨，三口人有十亩田地，只有一个人是主要劳动力，妻子还有点病。他一年要劳动三百二十天。农忙紧张的时候，互助组还帮了他十二个工，有很多家务劳动是起早带晚抓紧时间做的。一年中他的非生产时间只有四十五天，他的劳动是比较紧张的。
    一种是田地少、劳力多的户，他们的劳动时间比第一种类型户多，比第二种类型户少，他们花在副业上的时间多于农业上的时间。这种类型有四户。如卓幼凡，三口人，只有二亩六分田地。他是一个强壮的劳动力，全年劳动二百三十七天。其中农业劳动只有五十天，副业劳动则有一百三十二天，家务劳动五十五天。他的副业收入占全年总收入的56％。
    一种是劳动力弱，田地不多，而人口多、生活担子重的户。他们全年劳动的时间不多，其中从事农、副业劳动比重小，从事家务劳动的比重大。这种类型户只有一户。如郑德顺，七口人，五亩多田地，自己是个半劳动力。他全年劳动只有一百四十天。其中用于农业的只二十五天，用于副业的三十五天，而家务劳动则有八十天。还有二百二十多天的时间，因为无事可做，就无可奈何地浪费掉了。他的生活很困难。
    我们又着重调查了农民的家务劳动情况。当地农民的家务劳动有打柴、整米、种菜、挑水、临时赶集等内容。据计算，一个五口之家，在正常情况下，每年要有八十到八十五天的家务劳动时间。三口之家，则要六十天左右。这里的习惯，一般在冬春两季家务劳动要多一些，夏秋两季则仅是种些菜，主要精力花在农、副业上。以上述十户农民所需家务劳动时间平均计算，每一户平均需要八十二天，每一个劳动力平均需要五十八天半。
    入社以后的变化
    这十户农民入社以后，在今年上半年的一百八十天当中，除十八天因雨雪误工以外，剩下的一百六十二天，每个劳动力平均都出工一百五十三天，只有九天是自由支配的时间。在这一百五十三天中，集体生产的农业劳动又占主要地位，共有一百三十三天，比去年同期增加了三十六天（去年一月至六月农业劳动每个劳动力平均九十七天）。家庭副业用工每个劳动力则比去年同期平均二十七天多减少到十天左右，家务劳动也由去年每个劳动力平均做十九天多一点减少到十天多一点。
    上面的数字表明，农民入社以后劳动时间的支配起了很大的变化：集体的农业生产时间增加了，而个人的家庭副业和家务劳动时间则大大地减少了。
    社员们的要求
    在实行集体经营、改变生产关系以后，劳动出勤率的提高和农业用工的增加是必然的。但是在目前的情况下，把社员的家庭副业和家务劳动时间一下子卡得这样紧，是不是需要呢？社员是不是还有实际困难呢？我们就这个问题访问了几户社员。社员们对于这个问题的确有不少意见。他们认为多出工，多在农业上花费些劳动是应该的，但是社里对于社员个人必需要做的事情，却没有给予适当的时间。社员余项雨家没有柴烧，需要抽点时间打柴，但社里的农活排得很紧，没有时间打柴，夫妻两个就经常为这件事吵嘴。这十户当中还有四户社员经常得去街上（隔十二里）买小菜吃。有五户要求能抽点时间给他们做些家务事和进行适当的家庭副业生产，但这些要求，社里都没有很好解决。
    我们又同社里的几个领导人员座谈这个问题。他们承认在劳动时间上，对社员是卡的较紧。他们的理由有三：一、集体生产，人多势大，能显示农业社的优越性；二、集体生产能增加收入，社员私人搞副业生产不能增加社里的收入；三、如果安排时间给社员搞私人副业生产，那他们又成了单干，又会“发展资本主义”。因此，在四、五、六三个月内，他们把社员的全部时间，都紧紧地安排在集体生产的范围内。
    我们耐心地和他们研究之后，他们也认为适当安排一些时间给社员是可以的。以前卡的太紧，是因为他们思想上有上述那些看法和顾虑，实际上他们也知道，社员们是需要一定的时间从事家务劳动和进行家庭副业生产的。
    具体的建议
    我们对调查材料作了分析以后，又同社员、社干部座谈一次，研究这个问题应该如何解决。大家一致认为，在一年的时间中，除掉雨、雪误工以外，每个全劳动力，应该给予两个月左右的时间，由他们自由支配。这样，既不耽误社里的集体生产，社员也不感觉到社里卡的太死不自由，可根据自己的需要做些家庭副业、家务劳动及其他事务，还可适当地休息。在个人时间的安排上，社员们要求在冬春两季多安排一些，夏秋少安排一些。他们认为，如果社里能够全面规划，具体安排，保证每户社员都有一定的归自己自由支配的时间，对于集体和社员个人都是有利而无害的。
