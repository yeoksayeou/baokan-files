Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 16th: A scientific research team from the Ministry of Health of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic recently discovered an old man who is already 155 years old.

This old man is named Ye. Bi. Koroyev. He now lives in the village of Yermani in South Ossetia of the Georgian Republic. This is a mountain village at an altitude of 2,300 meters, with very beautiful scenery.

This old man was born in 1801, thirteen years earlier than Lermontov, and was a contemporary of Griboyedov and Pushkin. When Koroyev was twenty-five years old, he served as a cook for General Yermolov, a Russian general who governed Georgia. At that time, in order to enable Koroyev to go to many families and even have the opportunity to go abroad, Yermolov issued him a certificate. Now, this certificate is still kept by Koroyev.

This old man can still speak a few words of French, German, Italian, and English, which he learned decades ago, indicating that his memory is still very good.

    苏联有一位155岁的老人
    他生活的山村风景优美，记忆力还很好
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联格鲁吉亚共和国卫生部的一个科学研究所的考察队最近发现一个老人已经有155岁了。
    这个老人叫叶·比·科罗耶夫。他现在住在格鲁吉亚共和国南奥季亚的叶尔马尼村庄里。这是一个海拔两千三百公尺的山村，风景十分优美。
    这位老人生于1801年，比莱蒙托夫早生十三年，是格里波耶多夫和普希金的同时代的人。科罗耶夫在二十五岁的时候，曾经担任过一位总管格鲁吉亚的俄国将军叶尔莫洛夫的厨师。当时为了使科罗耶夫能够到许多家庭中去，甚至为了使他有机会出国，叶尔莫洛夫发给了他一封证明信。现在，这封证明信还保存在科罗耶夫的手里。
    这位老人现在还能够说几句法语、德语、意大利语和英语，这些都是他好几十年以前学会的，这说明他的记忆还是很好的。
