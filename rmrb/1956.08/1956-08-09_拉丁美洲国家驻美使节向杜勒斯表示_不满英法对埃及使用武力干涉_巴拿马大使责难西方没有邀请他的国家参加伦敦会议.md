Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 8th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles discussed the Suez Canal issue with the envoys of twenty Latin American countries to the U.S. on August 7th.

According to Reuters, during the discussion, the Latin American envoys raised many questions to Dulles regarding the possibility of Britain and France using force to interfere with Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. They asked what the legal basis was for Britain and France to use force.

Dulles replied that Britain and France could consider Egypt's measures of using police to confiscate the archives and property of the Canal Company as so-called "acts of aggression."

Reuters said that Dulles also defended the claims of the Western powers, arguing that an international conference should be held to discuss the Suez Canal issue instead of submitting the issue to UN agencies.

According to UPI, Panamanian Ambassador Vallarino expressed dissatisfaction that Panama had not been invited to the international conference. Dulles explained to him that the basis for invitation was that a country must have more than two million tons of shipping. Vallarino pointed out that Panama had more than three million tons. Dulles then said that most of these ships were actually owned by the United States, but simply flew the Panamanian flag.

Vallarino said, "We do not agree with this statement, but we can do nothing about it." He also said, "We believe that as long as Panama has more than three million tons, we are qualified to be invited."

    拉丁美洲国家驻美使节向杜勒斯表示
    不满英法对埃及使用武力干涉
    巴拿马大使责难西方没有邀请他的国家参加伦敦会议
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯八月七日同拉丁美洲二十个国家的驻美使节讨论了苏彝士运河问题。
    据路透社报道，在讨论中，拉丁美洲国家的使节们向杜勒斯提出了关于英法可能用武力干涉埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的许多问题。他们问，英法使用武力的法律根据是什么？
    杜勒斯回答说，英法可以认为埃及用警察没收运河公司的档案和财产的措施是所谓“侵略行为”。
    路透社说，杜勒斯还为西方三国的主张辩护，它们主张举行国际会议来讨论苏彝士运河问题，而不主张把这个问题提交联合国机构。
    据合众社报道，巴拿马大使瓦拉里诺对巴拿马没有被邀请出席国际会议表示不满。杜勒斯就这一点向他解释说，被邀请的基础是一个国家必须有二百万吨以上的船只。瓦拉里诺指出，巴拿马有三百多万吨。杜勒斯又说，这些船只实际上大部分是美国所有，只不过悬挂巴拿马国旗罢了。
    瓦拉里诺说：“我们不同意这种说法，但是我们对此无可如何”。他又说：“我们认为，只要巴拿马有三百多万吨，我们就有被邀请的资格。”
