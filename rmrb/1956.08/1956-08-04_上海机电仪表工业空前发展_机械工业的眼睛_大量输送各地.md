    Shanghai's electrical machinery and instrumentation industry, known as the "eyes of the mechanical industry," has seen further development in the first half of this year. In six months, Shanghai's eighty-four joint state-private electrical machinery and instrumentation factories produced a total of 277,000 electrical instruments, thermal instruments, and optical instruments for various parts of the country, exceeding the annual production plan by 40%, and increasing production by 2.1 times compared to the first half of last year.
    In the past, Shanghai could only produce a few simple instruments with low precision, such as ammeters, voltmeters, and pressure gauges. Since liberation, especially after many electrical machinery and instrument factories implemented joint state-private ownership in 1954, they have gradually manufactured many types of electrical machinery and instruments with higher precision. For example, among the instruments supplied to various parts of the country in the first half of this year were potentiometers for measuring electrical intensity, Wheatstone bridges for measuring resistance, electric meters with errors as small as 0.5% for measuring current and voltage, recording flow meters, pressure gauges, thermometers, and liquid level gauges for the petroleum industry, automobile factories, chemical plants, and power plants, radiation pyrometers for measuring high temperatures, and "optical flat surfaces" and sodium lamps for measuring the flatness of objects. These two instruments can measure flatness equivalent to only one-seven-hundredth the thickness of a hair. The largest of these instruments weighs two tons, and the smallest is only the size of an egg.
    Currently, workers at eight electrical machinery and instrument factories in Shanghai, such as Xincheng and Guanghua, are trial-manufacturing twenty types of instruments with varying degrees of precision. The automatic liquid level controller being trial-manufactured by the Xincheng Electric Appliance Factory can control the boiler water at a certain level. Once this instrument is successfully trial-manufactured, it will be supplied to the petroleum industry. (Liberation Daily)

    上海机电仪表工业空前发展
    “机械工业的眼睛”大量输送各地
    本报讯　被喻为“机械工业的眼睛”的上海机电仪表工业，今年上半年有了进一步的发展。半年里，上海八十四家公私合营机电仪表工厂，为全国各地生产了电工仪器、热工仪器和光学仪器共二十七万七千只，超额40％完成了全年生产计划，比去年上半年产量增加了二点一倍。
    过去，上海只能生产几种精密度不高的电流表、电压表、压力表等简单的仪表。解放以来，特别在1954年很多机电仪表厂实行公私合营以后，逐步制造出了很多种类的精密度较高的机电仪表。如今年上半年支援全国各地的仪表中就有量电力强度的电位差计，量电阻大小的电桥，量电流和电压的误差小到0.5％的电表，支援石油工业、汽车厂、化工厂和电厂用的记录式流量计、压力计、温度计、液面计，测量高温的辐射高温计，以及测量物件平度的“光学平量面”和钠光灯，这两种仪器可测出只相等一根头发丝的七百分之一粗细的平度。这些仪表最大的是二吨重，最小的只有鸡蛋大。
    目前，上海市新成、光华等八家机电仪表工厂的职工，正在试制二十种不同精密度的仪表。新成电器厂正在试制的自动液面控制器，可以把锅炉用水控制在一定水位上。这种仪表试制成功以后，将供应石油工业的需要。（解放日报）
