　　The Road of Arms Race is Impassable
　　——A Comment on the Western Countries' Reply to Bulganin——
　　Hu Jin

The leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, West Germany, and Turkey have successively replied to the disarmament proposal made by Bulganin in his letter of June 6. These replies, all tuned to the same note set by Washington, rejected the new Soviet disarmament initiative.

The starting point of the Soviet proposal is that international tensions are easing, the Cold War is disappearing, and countries have good conditions to take unilateral disarmament measures without waiting for the signing of an international disarmament agreement; these measures will greatly strengthen international trust and pave the way for comprehensive disarmament. The enthusiastic response of public opinion in various countries proves that the practicality and great significance of this new Soviet initiative are beyond doubt. The Western countries' refusal to accept it can only be explained by their unwillingness to quickly break the disarmament deadlock.

The US reply made no mention of any serious efforts the US is willing to make to promote disarmament. To conceal the US's lack of sincerity in disarmament, the US reply tried its best to belittle the great significance of the Soviet Union's massive arms reduction, rehashing the old tune that the US had already reduced its army after the war. However, if we are to talk about the demobilization of troops in the early post-war period, the scale of the Soviet Union's demobilization is unmatched. Moreover, the US post-war troop demobilization cannot conceal the fact that it has been actively engaged in arms expansion and war preparation for several years. Now, what people are asking for is to stop the frenzied arms race created by the US in recent years and eliminate the new war threat it brings to mankind. This is where the great practical significance of the new Soviet initiative lies.

The US reply attempts to place the responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement on disarmament issues since the Geneva Four-Power Summit on the Soviet Union, which is also a futile effort. It is enough to look at what has happened in the last two months to show how much this musty diplomatic tactic is worth.

It is well known that the Soviet Union's actions to massively reduce its armed forces and Bulganin's proposal have received widespread sympathy and support. But the Soviet Union did not stop there. At the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting in New York in July, it accepted the level of armed forces reduction for major powers proposed by Western countries for the second time as the first step in disarmament; it also proposed banning atomic and hydrogen weapons and stopping the testing of these weapons. On July 16, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union called on all countries to take effective measures to stop the expansion of armaments and approved the Foreign Minister's proposal on the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain concluding an agreement to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Following the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also decided to reduce or start reducing their armed forces again. The socialist countries have made so many new initiatives and measures conducive to the realization of international disarmament, but what has the United States done? The United States claims that disarmament should be implemented under international agreements, but at the recent Disarmament Commission, it continued to obstruct the reaching of an agreement and insisted on pushing all proposals to the Disarmament Subcommittee for discussion. It even refused to accept the proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing. Now, the US reply once again shows that the US is clinging to the "Open Skies" plan, using it to block any specific disarmament agreement; and the "Open Skies" plan is actually a military reconnaissance plan, which not only does not help to increase trust, but can only deepen international suspicion and fuel the arms race.

The US reply claims that the US "has always been studying the entire issue of arms limitation with utmost seriousness, first and foremost the issue of eliminating the increasingly serious threat of nuclear weapons and new delivery vehicles." But the rigid attitude shown by the United States in international consultation on disarmament issues makes this statement a specimen of hypocrisy. Yes, due to public pressure, the US propaganda machine has recently begun to talk about some kind of plan to reduce conventional armaments. However, both the State Department and the Pentagon have openly admitted that any such plan is not intended to lead to a halt to the arms race, but merely to shift to an expanded nuclear arms race track. Dulles revealed this consideration of the US ruling group on July 18: "The latest developments require more emphasis on modern weapons, the means to launch modern weapons, and protective measures against their radiation, rather than manpower as before." The testimony of Air Force Chief of Staff Twining in Congress, recently released by the US Department of Defense, stated more clearly: "We can significantly reduce our forces" because "we have decided that we will formulate a new strategy based on the principle of using atomic weapons in war."

In order to obscure this dangerous plan of the United States, Dulles even described the Soviet Union's massive disarmament action to promote peace as preparing for atomic war. However, Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov has powerfully refuted this distortion in his reply to the questions raised by the military editor of the "New York Times." He clearly pointed out: "The Soviet government's decision to reduce the army is not due to considering the nature of the conceived modern warfare methods, nor is it due to considering the so-called trends of modern warfare methods. On this issue, our starting point is to consider consolidating world peace and easing international tensions, in order to facilitate the development of the Soviet Union's peaceful economy and improve the material welfare of the Soviet people."

Therefore, the indisputable fact is that the Soviet Union has been persistently striving to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue, stop the arms race, and reduce the people's burden of military expenditure; while the United States continues to stubbornly obstruct disarmament and attempts to push the nuclear arms race further.

However, the development of the current situation is increasingly unfavorable to the attempts of "Cold War" advocates. Even in the countries of the Western military alliance, more and more politicians are beginning to take a more realistic attitude and express independent views on the issue of coexistence or war, economic competition or arms race. They now believe that the real serious threat to their countries does not come from elsewhere, but from the "Cold War" and the arms race. The "Cold War" and the arms race have created economic difficulties for these countries and weakened their independent position politically and militarily. A more realistic assessment of the situation has led some Western European countries, including Britain, to start cutting military spending or shortening the term of military service, regardless of Washington's dissatisfaction. The British "Times" editorial said that the disarmament proposition that constitutes the basis of Bulganin's proposal "has taken root in at least some Western countries." This statement is well-founded.

Washington exerts various diplomatic pressures, using helpers such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the West German Adenauer group to suppress the widespread disarmament demands in Western European countries, which may have a temporary binding effect on some ruling groups in Western European countries. However, in any case, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to make other countries continue to follow its disastrous policies. The attitude expressed in the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet joint statements on the disarmament issue has already proven this point. The strong pressure from the people of all countries demanding disarmament will eventually promote the resolution of the disarmament issue.

    军备竞赛的道路是走不通的
    ——评西方国家给布尔加宁的复信——
    胡今
    美、英、法、意、加拿大、西德和土耳其等国领导人，已先后答复了布尔加宁六月六日写给他们的建议裁军的信。这些复信都以华盛顿制定的同一个调子，拒绝了苏联新的裁军倡议。
    苏联的建议的出发点是：国际紧张局势趋向缓和，冷战正在消失，各国已有良好的条件采取单独裁军的措施而不必等待签订国际裁军协定；这些措施将会大大加强国际信任，为全面裁军铺平道路。各国舆论的热烈反应证明，苏联这个新倡议的现实性和它的重大意义，是无可怀疑的。西方国家的拒绝接受，除了说明它们不愿迅速打开裁军僵局以外，不可能有别的解释。
    美国的复信根本没有谈到美国愿意对促进裁军作出什么认真的努力。为了掩饰美国对裁军缺乏诚意，美国的复信竭力企图贬低苏联大量裁减军备的重大意义，重弹所谓美国在战后已经裁减过军队的老调。但是，如果要谈到战后初期的军队复员情况的话，苏联复员的规模是无可比拟的。而且，美国战后军队复员也是丝毫不能掩饰它几年来积极进行扩军备战的事实的。现在，人们要求的正是停止美国这几年来所制造的狂热的军备竞赛，消除由此给人类带来的新战争威胁。苏联新倡议的巨大的现实意义即在于此。
    美国复信企图把日内瓦四国首脑会议以来裁军问题未能达成协议的责任推在苏联身上，这也是枉费心机的。不必追溯更远的日子，就拿最近两个月发生的事情来说，就足够说明这种发了霉的外交手法究竟值得几文钱了。
    苏联大量裁军的行动和布尔加宁的建议得到了普遍的同情和支持，这是大家所知道的。但苏联并没有停留在这一步。它在七月间联合国裁军委员会纽约会议上，接受了西方国家第二次提出的大国武装部队裁减后的水平作为裁军的第一步；还建议禁止原子武器和氢武器，停止这些武器的试验。七月十六日，苏联最高苏维埃会议呼吁各国采取停止扩充军备的有效措施，并批准外交部长关于苏美英三国缔结停止原子武器和氢武器试验协定的建议。继苏联之后，捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国也决定再次或开始裁减它们的武装部队。社会主义国家作出了这样多的有利于实现国际裁军的新倡议和措施，但美国做了些什么呢？美国口口声声说应当在国际协议下实行裁军，但在最近裁军委员会上它继续阻挠取得协议，坚持把所有建议又推给裁军小组委员会去讨论。它甚至对停止核子武器试验的建议也拒绝接受。现在，美国的复信再一次表明，美国死死抱住“开放天空”计划不放，用它来阻挡任何具体的裁军协议；而“开放天空”计划实际是军事侦察计划，它不仅无助于增进信任，而且只能加深国际猜疑，助长军备竞赛。
    美国的复信声称美国“始终在极其认真地研究整个限制军备问题，首先是关于消除核子武器和新的投掷工具的日益严重的威胁的问题。”但是美国在国际协商裁军问题上所表现的死硬态度，使得这种声明成为伪善的标本。是的，由于舆论的压力，美国宣传机器最近开始谈论某种裁减常规军备的计划。但是，国务院和五角大楼都公开承认，任何这种计划并不是为了导致停止军备竞赛，而只是为了转上扩大的原子军备竞赛轨道。杜勒斯七月十八日就露骨地说明了美国统治集团的这种考虑：“最新的发展要求更着重现代化武器、发射现代化武器的手段，以及防备它们的放射的保护措施，而不是像以前那样着重人力了”。最近美国国防部公布的空军参谋长特文宁在国会的证词说得更明白：“我们可以大量裁减我们的部队”，因为“我们已经决定，我们要根据战争使用原子武器的原则而拟订一种新战略”。
    杜勒斯为了使人看不清美国这个危险打算，他硬把苏联大量裁军的促进和平的行动，也说成是为了替原子战争作准备。但是，苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅在给“纽约时报”军事编辑所提问题的答复中，已经有力地驳斥了这种歪曲。他明确地指出：“苏联政府裁减军队的决定并不是由于考虑到设想中的现代作战方法的性质，也不是由于考虑到所谓现代作战方法的趋势。在这个问题上，我们的出发点是考虑到巩固世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势，是为了利于发展苏联和平经济和提高苏联人民的物质福利”。
    因此，不容争辩的事实是，苏联坚持不懈地争取打开裁军问题的僵局，停止军备竞赛，减轻人民的军费负担；而美国则继续顽固地阻挠裁军，并企图把原子军备竞赛推进一步。
    但是，目前局势的发展，日益不利于“冷战”鼓吹者的企图。就是在西方军事联盟的国家中也有越来越多的政治家，开始对共处还是战争、经济竞赛还是军备竞赛的问题，采取比较现实的态度并表示独立的见解。他们现在认为，对于他们的国家来说，真正严重的威胁不是来自别的，而是来自“冷战”和军备竞赛。“冷战”和军备竞赛造成了这些国家的经济困难，并在政治上和军事上削弱了它们的独立地位。对形势的比较现实的估计已经使一些西欧国家，包括英国在内，不顾华盛顿的不满，开始自行削减军费或缩短兵役期限。英国“泰晤士报”社论说：构成布尔加宁建议的基础的裁军主张，“至少在某些西方国家生了根”。这一说法是有充分根据的。
    华盛顿施行种种外交压力，利用北大西洋公约组织和西德阿登纳集团之类的帮手，来压制西欧各国普遍出现的裁军要求，对西欧国家的一些统治集团还可以收一时约束的效果。但是，无论如何，美国想使其他国家继续追随它的灾难性政策是越来越困难了。英苏、法苏会谈声明对裁军问题所表示的态度，已经证明了这一点。各国人民要求裁军的强大压力，终将促进裁军问题的解决。
