    On Thoroughness
    Shi Liuming
    A worker at a state-owned cotton mill in Qingdao, who had recently moved into a self-built, publicly-assisted dormitory, wrote a doggerel:

      Self-built dormitories, with public assistance,
      Joyfully moving into a new house.
      But things are not always as good as they seem,
      The good times only last in three or five spots.
      Outside, the rain pours down,
      Inside, the drizzle is like silk.
      The sun rises, the wind blows, the earth dries,
      But the room is still damp.
      The gap on the east side urgently needs patching,
      How can we get past the muddy bank under the eaves?
      The whole family revolves around,
      Laughing and crying, helpless to the heavens!

    Although this poem is not very well written, it raises a question. At first glance, it is a criticism of the quality of the construction project. However, this is only one side of the issue. The other side shows that doing good things for the workers requires not only a good heart but also the determination and action to carry the good things through to the end. Otherwise, the masses will be dissatisfied and will inevitably put another "bureaucratism" hat on you. To put it politely, it also means: not enough concern for the lives of the workers.

    谈彻底
    石六鸣
    青岛市一个国棉厂的职工，搬进了自建公助宿舍不久，有人编了一首打油诗：
      自建宿舍公家助，欢天喜地住新屋。
      美事偏偏不如意，好境只有三五处。
      外面只要雨倾盆，屋内细雨犹如丝；
      日出风吹大地干，房内还是湿漉漉。
      东山缺口急待补，怎过檐下黄泥湾。
      一家大小团团转，哭笑不得奈何天！
    这首诗虽然写的不很好，却提出了问题。猛看是批评建筑工程质量的。但，这只是问题的一面。而另一面，说明为工人办好事不但要有好心肠，还要有把好事办彻底的决心和行动。否则，群众是不满意的，难免又被戴上一顶“官僚主义”的帽子，说的客气些也是：关心职工生活不够。
