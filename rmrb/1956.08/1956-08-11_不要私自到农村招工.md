    Do Not Recruit Laborers From Rural Areas Privately
    Recently, some cadres from construction units and farms in Beijing and Tianjin have been privately recruiting laborers in our county, which has affected agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics for the second quarter, in addition to organized recruitment, more than 2,000 farmers left to become workers due to private recruitment. In Tanquetun Village, Chengguan District, 30 people went to Tianjin to work as carpenters and bricklayers. In Dongwei Village, out of a total of 139 laborers in the whole village, 80 laborers left. Even the accountant of one agricultural production cooperative left without saying goodbye, leaving the members with no heart for production.
    Of course, it is our bounden duty to transfer a portion of the labor force to support industrial construction. However, this matter should be carried out in a planned way through the organization. Private recruitment like this not only affects agricultural production, but also makes it easy for bad people to take advantage of loopholes, which is very detrimental to the country's construction.

### 不要私自到农村招工

    不要私自到农村招工
    最近，北京、天津有些建筑单位和农场里的干部，私自到我们县里来招工，影响了农业生产。据第二季度不完全的统计，除有组织的招募之外，由于私自招工，共有两千多农民外出当了工人。城关区潭缺屯村有三十人到天津当了木瓦建筑工人，东魏村全村共有一百三十九个劳动力，就走掉八十个劳动力。有的农业生产合作社的会计也不辞而别，弄得社员无心生产。
    当然，调一部分劳动力支援工业建设是我们义不容辞的责任。可是，这件事也应该通过组织，有计划的进行。像这样私自招工，不仅影响农业生产，而且很容易被坏人钻空子，对国家的建设是很不利的。
