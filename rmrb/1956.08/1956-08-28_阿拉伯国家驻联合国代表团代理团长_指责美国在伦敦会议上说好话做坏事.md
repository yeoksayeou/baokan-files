Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 27th: The acting head of the Arab nations' delegation to the United Nations, Mr. Sayagh, accused the United States in a television talk on August 26th of taking a position at the London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue that infringed upon Egyptian sovereignty.

Sayagh said that US Secretary of State Dulles at the London conference abandoned "every principle concerning the rights of individuals and nations," and that the attitude taken by the United States was: "Saying some nice things about the rights of one party, while actually injecting some factors that would undermine the integrity of that party."

Sayagh reiterated the Arab nations' position: First, the canal is an integral part of Egypt; second, Egypt should decide on the management and operation of the canal; third, free navigation is not threatened in any way. He pointed out that Egyptian President Nasser will never accept a method of operating the Suez Canal that is again controlled by foreigners, and warned that if an armed attack occurs, the Arab world will defend Egypt "in any imaginable form."

    阿拉伯国家驻联合国代表团代理团长
    指责美国在伦敦会议上说好话做坏事
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：阿拉伯国家驻联合国代表团代理团长萨耶格8月26日在电视谈话中指责美国在讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议上采取侵犯埃及主权的立场。
    萨耶格说，美国国务卿杜勒斯在伦敦会议上背弃了“有关个人和国家的权利的每一条原则”，美国所采取的态度是：“对于一方的权利说了一些好听的话，而实际上却注入了一些会破坏这一方的完整性的因素”。
    萨耶格再次申明了阿拉伯国家的立场：一、运河是埃及整体的一部分；二、应该由埃及决定管理和经营运河的事情；三、自由通航没有受到任何威胁。他指出，埃及总统纳赛尔将永远不会接受再由外国人控制苏彝士运河的经营的办法，并且警告说，如果发生武装攻击，阿拉伯世界将“以任何可以想像的形式”来保卫埃及。
