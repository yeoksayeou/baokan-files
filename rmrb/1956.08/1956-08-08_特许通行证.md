To the "Special Pass" Editor:

	One sunny afternoon, the flow of people on the streets of Qiqihar City became active again. I walked to the Central Market and saw a traffic policeman chasing a student on a bicycle, about fifteen or sixteen years old, at the speed of a 100-meter runner. It turned out that the student was carrying a little girl on the back seat of his bicycle, which violated traffic rules. The traffic policeman, fearing he couldn't catch up, borrowed another bicycle and chased after him. At that time, I was moved by the traffic policeman's serious maintenance of traffic rules and prevention of accidents.

	However, just five or six days after this incident - around July 5th, as I passed through the traffic hub of the city - the Liberation Gate - a bicycle came speeding towards me. A woman was sitting on the back seat, and the bicycle passed through the Liberation Gate, where a traffic policeman was on duty, without any obstruction, and headed south. While I was wondering why the traffic policeman didn't intervene in this violation of traffic rules, I suddenly heard a comrade in worker's clothes walking in front of me say loudly to his companion: "Look, that's Director Kang of the Municipal Bureau of Culture's 'human-powered motorbike,' and the person sitting on the seat is his wife." His companion asked in surprise: "Doesn't that violate traffic rules? That's outrageous!" "Outrageous? Director Kang's 'human-powered motorbike' seems to have obtained a 'special pass.' The couple always rides on one bike affectionately to and from work every day."

	Director Kang, as a leading cadre of a state organ, actually considers himself a special person and does not abide by traffic rules. The relevant leaders of Qiqihar City should intervene in this matter.

### “特许通行证”

    “特许通行证”编辑同志：
    一个阳光明媚的下午，齐齐哈尔市大街上的人流又活跃起来。我走到中市场，看到一位交通警察以跑百米的速度追赶一个年约十五、六岁的骑自行车的学生，原来这个学生骑的车子后座上带着一个小女孩子，这是违反交通规则的。交通警察唯恐追不上，又借了一辆自行车骑着追赶。当时，我被这位交通警察认真维护交通规则，防止肇事的行为所感动。
    可是，就在这件事情发生五六天后——大约是七月五日，我路经市区的交通要冲——解放门时，迎面驰来一辆自行车，车子后座上也坐着一个妇女，自行车却无阻地通过了有交通警察值勤的解放门，向南驰去。当我正在奇怪交通警察为什么不干涉这种违犯交通规则的行为时，忽然听到在我前面走着的一个穿工人服的同志大声地和他同行的伙伴说：“你看，这是市文化局康局长的‘人力摩托化’，坐在车座上的是他的妻子。”他的伙伴惊奇地问：“这样不违犯交通规则吗？这太不像话了！”“不像话？康局长的‘人力摩托化’好像是领了‘特许通行证’的。人家两口子每天上下班老是亲亲热热地骑着一个车子。”
    康局长身为国家机关的领导干部，竟然以特殊人物自居，不遵守交通规则。齐齐哈尔市有关领导方面应该干预一下这件事。　张　治
