Crossing the Qinling Mountains
——From Baoji to Chengdu, Part Two
By Ji Xichen, Our Staff Reporter

Even the Gods Have to Stare Blankly
“The peaks are less than a foot from the sky,” immediately after passing the Dasan Pass is the Qinling Mountains.

Looking from a distance, one sees thousands of cliffs standing, and ten thousand mountains overlapping, with no end in sight. Under the morning sun, the mountain peaks appear a scarlet red, like a flame burning the blue sky. Ah! Qinling, you are tall and majestic, like a towering wall separating the north and south of our country; the mighty Yellow River and Yangtze River roll and separate at your feet! For many years, you have hindered the transportation between the northwest and southwest of our country. How many road-building heroes have toiled in your embrace to build a road here!

I heard that the workers fighting in the Qinling Mountains once made their heroic vows like this:

The stonemason said: "Give me a chisel and a drill, and I can carve the Qinling Mountains into a flower mountain!"

The transport worker said: "Give me a lever and a rope, and I can move the Qinling Mountains away!"

The tunnel worker said: "I can build an underground mansion in the belly of the deep mountains!"

The heroic working class has realized its vows. They leveled the cliffs inch by inch, filled the valleys, hollowed out the high mountains, built bridges over the turbulent rivers, and welcomed the train into the clouds!

In the past, a popular folk song here said:

Qinling has nine turns and eighteen bends,
Rising step by step into the clouds;
Ridge after ridge, mountain upon mountain,
Up and down takes half a day;
The mountains are high, and the rocks are hard,
Like an iron wall in general;
To build a railway here,
Even the gods have to stare blankly!

Now the gods have to stare blankly. The people have not only done it, but in the future, they will also be the first to electrify it!

The First Gate of Qinling

Those who have not been to the Qinling Mountains can hardly imagine the difficulty of conquering them! The steep peaks, the precipitous valleys, and the torrents of mountain floods block the traveler's path. As the poet Han Changli wrote: "Clouds obscure the Qinling Mountains, where is my home? Snow blocks the Blue Pass, and the horse cannot advance." On this side of the road is a towering cliff, and on the other side is a bottomless ravine. Patches of flying clouds cut off the mountainside. Sometimes, there is a drizzle below the mountains, but the mountain peaks are bathed in brilliant sunshine. The steep peaks float above the sea of clouds. These places, which seem difficult for even eagles to fly over, are now being left far behind by the dragon-like trains.

After passing the Qingjiang River Bridge, the train follows a gradient of up to thirty per thousand, and after passing through several "light bulb-shaped" lines composed of curved tunnels and bridges, after circling two semi-circles in opposite directions, it enters the Guanyin Mountain Station, hanging on the mountainside on the left bank of the Qingjiang River. Because the mountain shape is steep and narrow, and the station is small, three bridges had to be built as its track lines, and part of the station was built on top of the bridge.

Comrades from the Engineering Bureau told me that this was originally an uninhabited wilderness, a cliff where even mountain goats could not stand. The 360,000 cubic meters of earth and stone for building the station would have required at least a thousand people to work for a year if excavated manually. Time did not allow it, so what to do? Later, it was decided to use large-scale blasting. The blasting captain, Communist Party member Liu Yunhe, under the guidance of Soviet experts, loaded one hundred and twenty tons of explosives transported by eighty trucks into three hundred and forty-nine explosive chambers overnight. Within a few seconds, four towering mountain peaks were leveled. Comrade Liu Yunhe, who fell ill from exhaustion, smiled and said to people when he heard the earth-shattering roar in his delirium:

"It's done, it's done, the train has passed the first gate of Qinling!"

On the Mountain Road

In the Water Margin's "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang," there is a description of Song Jiang's troops being trapped in the Pantuo Road, where the "left turn and right turn" caused the entire army to be in an uproar. The Qinling railway, similar to this "Pantuo Road," also confuses many passengers so that they cannot distinguish east, west, north, and south.

The winding and tortuous line sometimes seems to be going south, sometimes turning north, and suddenly a train appears on the east side. Seeing this scene, the passengers can't help but be surprised: "Why can three trains appear at once on one section of railway?"

"No, it's not three trains, it's one train," Engineer Wang, who is familiar with the terrain, explained with a smile, "Because there are too many curves, you can often see the train three times when you pass once!"

This section of the line is high and steep, and the elevation difference is 680 meters over a straight line distance of six kilometers. If the line did not wind around the mountains, it would be impossible to climb such a high mountain. Therefore, the railway had to wind its way up. In a distance of only six kilometers, it winds around for twenty-seven kilometers. Here, the railway passes through eight "S"-shaped tunnels, making the line an "8"-shaped mountain road. A tunnel on the upper layer of the mountain road crosses over a tunnel on the lower layer of the railway on the mountainside of Dengtaigou. Caves are stacked on top of each other, like a two-story building!

The train runs on the mountainside in this way. First from south to north, then turning west to south, heading straight for the peak of the Qinling Mountains.

From Yangjiawan to Qinling, a distance of thirty kilometers, the railway passes through a total of forty-seven tunnels. In this dense "tunnel group," there is a place less than six kilometers long where more than ten tunnels and six bridges are concentrated. Many tunnels and bridges are almost end-to-end and cave-connected, and the length of the tunnels reaches 80% of the line. Traveling here, even during the day, it is difficult to see the sun and the sky!

Seeing these magnificent and ingenious projects, the passengers exclaimed in amazement: "It's too great, it should be made into a movie so that the people of the whole country can see it!"

"In Qinling, a monument should be built for the road-building heroes!"

"The Station in the Clouds"

After passing the "8"-shaped mountain road, a milky white mist appears before our eyes. The panting train seems to be traveling on a white carpet, and strands of cloud silk constantly float into the car window.

This is the Qingshiyan Station, located 1,200 meters above sea level. Its station yard is built between stone cliffs more than 300 meters high. It is different from other stations; its belly is in the open air, and its head and tail extend into the tunnels at both ends. Because it is often obscured by clouds and mist, people affectionately call it "the station in the clouds."

The construction of Qingshiyan Station experienced countless difficulties. A comrade from the Sixth Engineering Bureau recited a poem written by the workers themselves to me:

Feet on dangerous rocks, hands reaching for the sky,
Waist wrapped in ropes, hanging in the air;
Splitting open the fierce mountain to open the roadbed,
Filling up the valleys as a plain.

This poem truly describes the heroic spirit of conquering Qingshiyan. At that time, in order to build a station on Qingshiyan, whether it was a night of howling wind or a day of wind and snow, the workers always climbed to the cliffs with hemp ropes. Where there was no foothold on the rock wall, they fastened their safety belts and suspended themselves in the air to excavate the guide holes for blasting. Then, they loaded 340 tons of explosives, and in an unprecedented large explosion, they blasted off a stone cliff as high as fifteen floors, and only then did they open up such a station. Now, on the bare broken walls, there are still traces of blackened explosives. The dead trees with broken branches and roots hang upside down in the west wind. The eagles spinning among the peaks and rocks can no longer find their former nests.

The Ribbon in the Mountains

Stepping out of Qingshiyan Station, in the blink of an eye, we arrived at the Songshupo Bridge.

This stone arch bridge, entirely built of grayish-white granite, is like a clean white ribbon hanging between the green walls of two mountains facing each other, simple, majestic, and very beautiful. Around the bridge, wild flowers are bright, and thousands of butterflies are flying. The waterfall cascading down from the peak on the right, like a string of white beads more than 100 meters long, flows through the bridge opening into the mountain stream.

The Songshupo Bridge is 51 meters high and is one of the highest bridges in our country. The span of the arch is 38 meters, which is even longer than the famous "Zhaozhou Bridge" built 1,300 years ago (Sui Dynasty). Standing on the bridge and looking into the distance, on the winding Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway on the left, beetle-like cars crawl in strings towards the Qinling Mountains.

Tang Zhili, the female captain of the bridge engineering team who personally participated in the construction of the bridge, recalled how excited she was when they built the bridge arch in the rain, transported stone materials from the high-altitude cableway, and used bells and whistles to direct and coordinate the bridge construction above and below the bridge! She said:

"This is the greatest joy of my life. On the day the bridge was completed, when I sat on the bridge, touching it with my face and hands, and seeing the train safely passing over it, I was so excited that tears fell!"

Opening Up the Qinling Mountains

At noon, the train entered the Qinling Tunnel, 1,500 meters above sea level. This tunnel, which is five li long, is one of the longest tunnels in the country. The spacious tunnel is hung with electric lights from beginning to end. The tall arch, the white cave walls, and the fresh air give people a bright, quiet, and magnificent feeling. A companion said interestingly: "Walking here, it's so much like walking into the Moscow subway!"

Travelers, when you pass through here, please remember the heroes who opened up the tunnel and pay your respects to them! It was they who braved the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, crawled in the ice and snow, and attacked the stone mountain with wind drills in their hands that were cracked and bleeding. It was they who went deep into the ground on stormy nights, digging mud and sand, their whole bodies covered so that only their white teeth were exposed. It was they who wore "armor" that had frozen into ice blocks in the face of water spring attacks and overcame faults and collapses. The youth commando team led by Communist Party member Ning Yongqing "crossed the water line three times and grabbed the collapse eight times," rescuing the most dangerous project. After more than five hundred days and nights, the Qinling Mountains were finally opened up. (Attached picture)

    跨过秦岭
    ——从宝鸡到成都之二
    本报记者　纪希晨
    天神也得干瞪眼
    “连峰去天不盈尺”，一过大散关就是秦岭。
    远处看去，只见千岩林立，万山叠叠，一眼望不到顶。朝阳射照下，山峰呈现一片绯红色，仿佛一团火焰燃烧着青天。呵！秦岭，你高大雄伟，像参天的高墙横隔在我国南北之间；一泻千里的黄河、长江，滚滚在你的脚下分开！多少年来，你一直横阻着我国西北、西南的交通，为着从这里修一条道路，多少筑路英雄奔忙在你的怀抱里面！
    我听人说，战斗在秦岭的工人，曾这样发出他们豪迈的誓言：
    石工说：“给我一把锉头，一根钎子，我能把秦岭雕成花山！”
    运输工说：“给我一根杠子，一条绳子，我能把秦岭搬开！”
    隧道工说：“我能在深山肚里修出地下楼阁来！”
    英雄的工人阶级，实现了自己的誓言。他们一寸寸的削平了悬岩，填平了低谷，掏空了高山，在汹涌的江流上架起桥来，把火车迎进云霄里面！
    过去，这里流行的一首歌谣里说：
    秦岭九拐十八弯，
    步步升高在云间；
    岭接岭，山叠山，
    一上一下得半天；
    山又高，石又坚，
    好象铁墙似一般；
    这儿要修火车路，
    天神也得干瞪眼！
    这下天神可得干瞪眼了。人民不仅办到了，将来，还要首先使它电气化！
    秦岭第一关
    没有到过秦岭的人，很难想像征服秦岭的艰险！那壁立的山峰，陡峭的峡谷，山洪的激流，横阻在旅客的面前。正如诗人韩昌黎所写：“云横秦岭家何在，雪拥蓝关马不前”。路这边是高不见顶的峻崖，那一边是深不见底的谷涧，一片片飞云，把山腰遮断起来。有时山下落着霏霏细雨，山岭之上却是阳光灿烂。峻险的山峰浮泅在云海的上面。这些看来连苍鹰都难飞越的地方，现在却被游龙似的火车，一座座远抛在后边。
    过了清姜河大桥，车子循着高达千分之三十的坡度，一连穿过几座曲线隧道、桥梁组成的“电灯泡形”的线路，绕了两个方向相反的半园圈以后，在清姜河左岸的高山上，驶进了悬在半山腰的观音山车站。这里因为山形陡窄，站场窄小，不得不修三座桥，作它的股道线，站场的一部分建立在桥上面。
    工程局的同志告诉我说：这里原是杳无人烟的荒山，连山羊也站不住脚的悬岩。修筑站场的三十六万土石方，如果用人工开挖，至少需要一千人劳动一年。时间不允许，怎么办呢？后来决定使用大爆破方法。爆破队长、共产党员刘云和，在苏联专家指导下，把八十辆汽车运来的一百二十吨炸药，连夜装进三百四十九个药室导洞里，在几秒钟之内，四个耸立的山头就被削平。累病了的刘云和同志，在昏迷中听到山崩地裂的轰响时，笑着对人说：
    “好了，好了，火车通过了秦岭第一关！”
       盘山道上
    水浒传“三打祝家庄”中，曾有宋江兵马困入盘陀道时“左回右转”全军哗然的描写。类似这种“盘陀道”的秦岭铁路，同样也使许多旅客迷混得辨认不出东西南北来。
    盘绕曲折的线路，时而像是向南，时而又折向北边，忽然在东面又看到出现了一列火车，看到这种情景，旅客们都禁不住惊异起来：“为什么一段铁路，一次能出现三列火车？”
    “不，不是三列，是一列，”熟悉这带地形的王工程师，笑着解释说：“因为弯道太多，所以，常常过一趟能看到三次火车！”
    这一带线路高陡，六公里的空中直线距离，高差达六百八十公尺。线路如果不穿山盘绕而行，根本无法爬上这样的高山。于是，铁路不得不东拐西弯的盘旋向上。在本来只有六公里的距离内，往来盘绕了二十七公里。在这里，铁路穿过八个“S”形的隧道，使线路成为“8”字形的盘山道。盘山道的上层铁路的一个隧道，和下层铁路的一个隧道，在灯台沟的山洞上交叉而过。洞上叠洞，好像两层楼房一样！
    火车就这样在山腰中奔驰着。先从南向北，然后又向西转南，直奔秦岭峰顶。
    从杨家弯到秦岭的三十公里，铁路共穿过四十七座隧道。在这密集的“隧道群”里，有一处不满六公里的地方，竟集中了十多座隧道、六座桥梁。许多隧洞、桥梁，几乎都是首尾相接，桥洞相连，隧道长度竟达线路的80％。旅行在这里，即使在白天，也难得看见太阳和天空！
    看了这些规模宏伟，巧夺天工的工程，旅客们都惊异赞叹着地说：“太伟大了，应该拍成电影，叫全国人民都看看！”
    “在秦岭，应该给筑路英雄们修起纪念碑来！”
    “云雾里的车站”
    过了“8”字盘山路，一片乳白色的云雾，拥现到我们的眼前。气喘吁吁的火车，仿佛行进在一块白色的地毯上面，一丝丝云丝不住袅袅地飘进车窗来。
    这里是拔海一千二百公尺的青石岩车站。它的站场修建在三百多公尺高的石岩间。它和别的车站不同，肚子在露天里，头和尾都伸在两头的隧道里。因为经常为云雾掩遮，所以人们都亲切地唤它叫“云雾里的车站”。
    修筑青石岩车站，经历了无数艰难。第六工程局的一位同志向我诵读了工人们自己写的一首诗：
    脚登险岩手攀天，
    腰缠绳索空中悬；
    劈开凶山开路堑，
    填起沟谷当平原。
    这首诗，真实的描写了征服青石岩的英雄气概。当时，为着要在青石岩修起一座车站，无论是寒风怒吼的夜晚，或是风雪交加的白天，工人们总是拉着麻绳攀登到悬岩峭壁上面。岩壁没有立足的地方，他们就拴上安全带，悬在半空中，开凿放炮的导峒空眼。然后，装上三百四十吨炸药，在一次空前的大爆破里，炸削掉了十五层楼那样高的石岩，才开拓出这样一个车站。现在，光秃秃的断壁上，还遗留着熏黑的炸药痕迹。残枝断根的枯木杂树，倒垂着在西风中晃摆。飞旋在峰岩间的老鹰，已经寻不见昔日栖息的巢穴。
    山间的飘带
    走出青石岩车站，一眨眼就到了松树坡大桥。
    这座全部由灰白色花岗石砌成的石拱桥，好似一条洁白的飘带，横挂在两山对峙的绿壁中间，简洁壮伟，十分俊美。桥的四周，野花鲜艳，蝴蝶盈千。从右面高峰上倾泻下来的瀑布，像一百多公尺长的白珠练，哗哗地穿过桥洞流入山涧。
    松树坡大桥高五十一公尺，是目前我国最高的桥梁之一。桥的孔径跨度三十八公尺，比在一千三百年前（隋朝）修的著名的“赵州桥”还要长一些。站在桥上向远处望去，左边蜿蜒如带的川陕公路上，甲虫似的汽车，成串地爬行着向秦岭驶去。
    亲自参加建桥的桥工队女队长汤之莉，回忆到当初他们在阴雨中砌筑桥拱，从高空索道运送石料，桥上桥下用敲钟、吹哨指挥调度砌桥时，她是多么激动呵！她说：
    “这是我平生最大的欢快。驾起桥那天，当我在桥上坐着，用脸贴着它，手摸着它，看到火车安全地从它身上通过去时，我竟激动得掉下泪来！”
     打通秦岭
    中午时分，火车开进了拔海一千五百公尺的秦岭隧道。这座长达五华里的隧道，是全国最长的隧道之一。宽敞的隧道里，从头到尾都张挂着电灯。高大的拱顶，白色的洞壁，清新的空气，给人以明亮、恬静、壮丽的感觉。一位同伴有趣地说：“走到这里，多么像走进了莫斯科的地下铁道呵！”
    旅客们，当你乘车经过这里时，请记住打通隧道的英雄们，向他们致敬吧！是他们冒着零下二十度的严寒，匍匐在冰雪中，用裂开血口的双手，把着风钻向石山进攻。是他们在狂风暴雨的夜晚，下到地层深处，挖泥掏沙，浑身糊得只露出一处白牙齿。是他们在水泉袭击下，穿着浑身冻成了冰块的“盔甲”，战胜了断层、塌方。共产党员宁永庆领导的青年突击队“三跨水线，八抢塌方”，抢救了最危险的工程。经过了五百多个日夜，终于打通了秦岭。（附图片）
