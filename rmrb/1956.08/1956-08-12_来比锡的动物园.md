The renowned city of Leipzig in East Germany boasts a nationally famous zoo. It attracts people from far and wide with its diverse collection of animals and exquisite facilities. Foreigners visiting Leipzig almost never miss the opportunity to come here and admire the exotic birds and beasts, increasing their knowledge of the animal kingdom. When we visited, it was late spring and early summer. The zoo was lush with trees, with dense shade along the paths, and a steady stream of visitors.

The aquarium at the zoo is particularly outstanding. Inside, many large glass tanks are arranged side by side, with water flowing constantly. Based on the different living environments and requirements of various aquatic animals, the tanks are equipped with artificial mountains, coral, gravel, and aquatic plants. There are many fish here, some from cold regions, some from the tropics, some from the ocean, and some from rivers. The variety of species, the differences in shape, and the richness of colors are truly difficult for an ordinary visitor to list and describe. They sometimes raise their heads to explore the surface of the water and sometimes dive into the depths, appearing very carefree, as if living in their original environment.

The lions and tigers here are exceptional. The lion and tiger enclosures are tall and sturdy buildings, worthy of being called lion and tiger palaces. The enclosures are shaped like the Chinese character "凵," with the inner and outer edges divided into many interconnected small compartments. By simply opening the iron gates, the inner and outer edges and the left and right compartments can be connected. This allows visitors to see these "giant creatures" whether they are inside or outside the enclosures.

There are many types of lions here, from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. The most attractive are the many small lion cubs. During our visit, a German comrade working at the zoo even brought out two newly born lion cubs for us to see. Touching their fur, it was very soft, and their temperament was also very docile. It's hard to imagine that they are so tame when young, yet grow up to become the "king of beasts." The tigers here are all isolated and live separately. One of them is particularly fierce and irritable, and looks somewhat like our Northeast tiger.

The bears in the zoo are very interesting. A young woman was teaching a black bear various tricks in a circular enclosure. When learning to ride a bicycle, one mischievous little bear refused to concentrate and kept gesturing to the young woman. After the woman gave it a few biscuits, it rode the small bicycle quickly around the enclosure. The black bear has also learned many other actions, such as walking on a ball and pushing a small trolley. The Leipzig Zoo not only exhibits bears as animals, but also trains them so that they can be more attractive to the audience, like bears in a circus.

In the reptile house, there are crocodiles from all over the world, including the Chinese alligator, a specialty of the Yangtze River in our country. There are also many snakes here, with pythons as thick as bowls and more than ten feet long, coiling and slowly wriggling, looking gloomy and terrifying. In addition, there are lizards, grass snakes, cobras, striped snakes, yellow snakes, and black snakes. Some snakes are very small, but look dangerous. There are also several large turtles and softshell turtles, all about three feet long and two feet wide. They crawl on the ground, quietly gnawing on grass, attracting many viewers.

In addition to the animals mentioned above, the Leipzig Zoo also has many other things that are of interest, such as black and white piglets and large white rats, brownish-black hippos, brave Spanish bulls, yaks, as well as elephants, swans, cranes, peacocks, and so on.

The Leipzig Zoo is not as large as the Beijing Zoo, but its facilities are more complete, and the level of scientific arrangement and management is also higher. In terms of the animals on display, the Leipzig Zoo has more lions, tigers, and reptiles, but the Beijing Zoo is richer in monkeys and birds. If the two could learn from each other through more exchanges, it would certainly allow animal lovers in both China and Germany to have more enjoyment. (Attached picture)

    来比锡的动物园
    梅山  雪丽
    民主德国的南部名城来比锡有一个驰名全国的动物园。它以种类繁多的动物和精致的设备吸引着远近的人们。到过来比锡的外国人，几乎都不会放过机会到这里来观赏一番奇禽异兽，增加自己对动物界的见识。我们去参观的时候，正是春末夏初，园内树木葱茏，浓荫夹道，路上游人络绎不绝。
    动物园的水族馆是很突出的。馆内并列地摆着许多大玻璃箱，里面的水川流不息。根据各种水生动物的不同的生活环境和要求，在箱内安置了假山、珊瑚、砂石、水草等。这里的鱼非常之多，有的来自寒带，有的来自热带，有的来自海洋，有的来自河川。其种类之多，形状之异，色彩之富，实在是一个普通的参观者所难以列举和描述的。它们时而昂首探出水面，时而潜入水底，显得十分逍遥自在，就像生活在原来的环境里一样。
    这里的狮虎是出众的。狮棚和虎棚都是高大而牢固的建筑物，堪称狮虎之宫。棚成“凵”字形，其内沿和外沿分成许多相连的小间。要只拉开铁栅门，内外沿和左右各间都可串通。这使得观众无论在棚内棚外都可以看到这些“庞然大物”。
    这里的狮子种类很多，欧、美、亚、非各洲都有。最吸引人注意的是许多小狮子。我们在参观的时候，一位在动物园里工作的德国同志还特地抱出二头刚刚出生不久的小狮子来给我们看。抚其皮毛，柔软非常，性情也很乖巧。想不到幼时这样驯顺，而长大以后竟成“百兽之王”。这里的老虎都被隔离分居。其中有一只非常凶猛暴燥，看来有些像我国的东北虎。
    动物园里的熊是很有趣的。有一个女郎在圆形的栅栏里教黑熊学习各种动作。在学习骑自行车时，有一个调皮的小熊不肯专心，并且不时向女郎示意。女郎给了它几块饼干以后，它就骑上小自行车在栅栏内飞快地兜起圈子来了。黑熊还学会很多动作，如站在圆球上走动，推小滑车等。来比锡动物园不但把狗熊当作动物展出，而且还加以训练，使它们能够像马戏团里的狗熊那样更吸引观众。
    在爬虫类动物馆里，有来自世界各地的鳄鱼，其中包括我国扬子江特产的鳄鱼。这里的蛇也特别多，巨蟒粗如碗口，长有丈余，盘着圈儿在那里慢慢地蠕动，看起来阴沉可怕。此外，还有四脚蛇、花蛇、眼镜蛇、斑条蛇、黄蛇和黑蛇等。有的蛇虽然很细小，但长相凶险。这里还有几只大乌龟和大鳖，都有三尺来长，两尺来宽。它们爬在地上静静啃草吃，吸引着很多的观众。
    除了上述这些动物外，来比锡动物园还有许多令人感到兴趣的东西，如黑白相间的小猪和大白鼠，棕黑色的河马，骁勇善斗的西班牙牛，犛牛，还有大象、天鹅、仙鹤、孔雀等等。
    来比锡动物园的规模不及北京动物园那么大，但它的设备却比较完善，布置、管理的科学水平也高一些。从展出的动物来说，来比锡动物园的狮、虎和爬虫类动物较多，但猴子和鸟类却不及北京动物园那么丰富。如果两者能通过更多的交换取长补短的话，那定能使中德两国的动物爱好者增加更多的眼福。（附图片）
