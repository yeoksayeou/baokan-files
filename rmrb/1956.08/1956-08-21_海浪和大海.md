    Waves and the Sea
    Li Yan Chang

    A large ship sailing in the ocean was overturned by a huge wave.

    From then on, the wave thought that there was nothing more powerful than it in the world, so it wanted to leave the sea and conquer the entire world.

    The wave shouted to the sea, "Goodbye! I won't stay in your arms anymore! I already have enough power!"

    The sea shook its head gloomily and said:

    "Don't be crazy! If you leave me, you won't have any power."

    "What?" the wave shouted angrily. "Didn't you see how I overturned the big ship? Didn't you see how people fear me?"

    The wave proudly raised its head and sped across the sea. It wanted to destroy the embankment and trample the embankment under its feet.

    The wave jumped with all its might and left the sea. It pressed against the embankment with all its strength.

    However, when the wave fell on the embankment, it turned into countless water droplets and small streams, flowing weakly in all directions. The embankment, on the other hand, did not move at all.

    海浪和大海
    李燕昌
    一只航行在海洋中的大船，被一个巨大的海浪打翻了。
    海浪从此以为世界上没有比它更有力的东西了，于是就想离开大海，去征服整个世界。
    海浪向大海嚷着：“再见吧！以后我可不在你的怀抱里啦！我已经有足够的力量啦！”
    大海阴郁地摇着头说：
    “你可别发昏哪！你离开了我，就会什么力量也没有的。”
    “什么？”海浪愤怒地嚷了起来。“你没看见，我是怎样把大船掀翻的吗？你没看见，人们是怎样惧怕我吗？”
    海浪骄傲地仰着头，在海面上飞奔。它想去把堤岸打毁，把堤岸踏在自己脚底。
    海浪用力一跃，离开了大海。用自己的全部力量，向堤岸压去。
    可是，海浪落到堤岸上，就变成了无数的水珠和小水流，无力地流向四方。堤岸呢，一动也不动。
