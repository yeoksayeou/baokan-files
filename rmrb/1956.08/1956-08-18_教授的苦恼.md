    The Professor's Troubles
    Sha Ou
    I recently had the opportunity to go to Qingdao and met several professors on vacation. During our casual conversation, we talked about something that we all found troubling.
    They all teach Marxism-Leninism courses, and everyone knows the importance of this subject. They sincerely hope that their students are not hypocritical but are people of integrity who act in accordance with their words. However, before this summer vacation, during the final exams at the school, they encountered the following situations:
    One student drew the topic of "Communist Morality." After some thought, the student wrote a detailed outline and answered fluently during the oral examination. The professors asked many questions, and the student answered them all with ease. The student's exam score was beyond doubt, but the professor was troubled because he knew that this very student had been expelled from the Communist Youth League a few days earlier due to poor character, moral corruption, and a bad reputation. What to do? The verbal "Communist Morality" deserved a score of five, but the behavior was shameful! They had no choice but to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, and our professor reluctantly gave a score of five.
    Another student drew the topic of "Socialist Labor" and answered it perfectly, but this student was an incorrigible book thief. The teacher hesitated, wondering what score to give. They had no choice but to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, and this professor reluctantly gave a score of five.
    A student drew the topic of "Laws of Social Development" and also answered very well. However, after finishing the answer, the student openly declared that it was only for the sake of the exam and that he himself did not believe in the laws of social development at all. Because the answer was good, the professor could only give a score of five.
    Of course, these are individual examples in each department. I heard the professors say that similar examples exist in other universities as well.
    Marxism-Leninism is not dogma but a guide to action! The professors watched their students say one thing and do another, but when determining their performance in studying Marxism-Leninism, they didn't ask what they did, as long as they could memorize the articles thoroughly.
    Isn't this promoting dogmatism?
    The professors naturally have troubles.

    教授的苦恼
    沙鸥
    我最近有一个偶然的机会到了青岛，碰见了几位在休假中的教授，闲谈中谈出了彼此都感到有些苦恼的一件事。
    他们都是教马克思列宁主义课程的，这门课程的重要性，谁都清楚。他们十分期望他们的学生不是口是心非，而是言行一致的人。但在今年暑假以前，他们在学校中举行期终考试的时候，却遇着这样一些情况：
    一个学生抽着了“共产主义道德”这样一个题目，这位学生略加思索之后，就写出了详尽的提纲，口试的时候答得头头是道，教授多次提问，学生都应答如流。这位学生的考试成绩是无可怀疑的了，但教授有些为难了，因为教授知道，就是这位学生，前几天才被开除了团籍，因品质恶劣、道德败坏而名声很不好。怎么办呢？嘴巴上的
  “共产主义道德”应该得五分，而行为却见不得人！只好按高教部的规定行事，我们的教授苦恼地划上了五分。
    一个学生抽着了“社会主义劳动”，也是答得十分完美，但这位学生却是屡教不改的一位专门偷书的小偷。老师踌躇了，分数该怎么打呢？只好按高教部的规定行事，这位教授勉强划上了五分。
    一位学生抽着了“社会发展规律”这样一个题目，也是答得很好。但是，这位学生在答完之后，竟公然提出声明，说这仅仅是为了考试，而他自己根本就不相信有社会发展规律云云。因为答得很好，教授也只能划上五分。
    当然，这些都是各系中个别的例子。我听教授们说，这样的例子别的大学也有。
    马克思列宁主义不是教条，而是行动的指南呵！教授们眼看着自己的学生说一套，作一套，而在断定学习马克思列宁主义的成绩的时候，偏偏不问作的是什么，只要把条文背得烂熟就行了。
    这岂不是在提倡教条主义吗？
    教授们就自然有苦恼了。
