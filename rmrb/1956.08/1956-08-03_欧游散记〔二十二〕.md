European Travel Notes
(22)

Rainy, Foggy London

We didn't encounter the famous London fog, which I heard can disrupt London's traffic. But we did experience the rough waves of the English Channel, said to be the biggest in ten years. As a result, when we arrived at the hotel, we didn't even want dinner, just wanted to rest. What made us happy was that each room had some fruit, and we were told it was a gift from a Londoner who didn't want to reveal their name.

In the rain and fog, we enjoyed the scenery along the Thames. Among the bridges, the famous Waterloo Bridge had the least decoration, its gray iron frame appearing quite majestic. The guards at Buckingham Palace were performing the traditional changing of the guard ceremony, their fur hats covering their eyes. On a road next to the palace, the cavalry guard rode tall horses, wearing old-fashioned uniforms. The Queen's car left the palace, and some people hurried to take pictures, while a uniformed policeman quickly pointed to himself, asking the photographer to include him in the shot. In the bustling Piccadilly Circus, bars and entertainment venues stood side by side, and a group of drunk men and women sang songs in the street. Hyde Park was deserted, and we didn't see any politicians giving speeches there. - That's how we got our first look at London in the rain and fog.

London's Musical Life

London's concerts are attractive, with world-renowned artists constantly performing there. London's two opera houses each have their own characteristics, but both have excellent performers and share the same serious attitude towards artistic creation. This seems different from some artists on the continent who blindly pursue fashion. British ballet has a very high level, but unfortunately when we were in London, these ballet dancers were all traveling abroad or in other parts of the country. However, some British ballet students met with Chinese artists. The Chinese artists specially performed all the movements of the Chinese classical opera training for actors, as well as the actors' daily physical exercises. This aroused great interest among professors and students of the two dance schools in London. They believed that this was a complete system with extraordinary efficiency. These future British ballet stars also performed for the Chinese artists, showing their generally high level of talent.

London's orchestras are among the best in the world, and the Royal Festival Hall, where concerts are often held, is a modern building known for its perfect acoustics. The boxes in this concert hall look like birdcages hanging irregularly on the wall, and many places have honeycomb-like holes. The cushions on the back of the chairs are also fitted with rubber honeycomb-like objects. In this hall, the huge London Symphony Orchestra and the famous Czech Smetana Quartet both produce the same clear and beautiful sound, and the quality of the music is not affected whether the hall is full of listeners or even completely empty.

    欧游散记
    〔二十二〕
    赵沨
    雨雾的伦敦
    我们没有赶上伦敦的大雾，据说大雾会使伦敦的交通都受到阻碍的。但我们却经历了英伦海峡的风浪，听说还是十年来最大的一次，因而当我们一到旅馆，连晚饭都不想吃了，只想赶快休息一下。使我们高兴的是每个房间都放了一些水果，人们只告诉我们说这是一位伦敦人送来的礼物，而送礼的人不愿意说出自己的名字。
    在雨雾中，我们欣赏了泰晤士河岸的景色。几座大桥中以著名的滑铁卢桥最缺少装饰，灰铁的架子倒显得很是壮观。白金汉宫的卫队正举行着传统的换班仪式，皮毛的大帽子压到每个士兵的眼睛上。皇宫旁的一条道路上，骑兵卫队骑着高头大马，身上穿着古式的制服。英国女王的汽车出宫了，有人赶忙去照像，而穿着制服的警察也赶忙指着自己，要求照像的人把他也照到镜头里去。在最热闹的皮卡德莱区，酒吧、娱乐场林立，一群喝醉的男女在大街上唱起歌来了。海德公园很冷清，也没有遇见政治家在那里发表演说。——我们就这样在雨雾中第一次看了一下伦敦城。
    伦敦的音乐生活
    伦敦的音乐会是吸引人的，世界的名家经常不断的在那里演出。伦敦的两家歌剧院各有特色，但都拥有很好的演员并且有着同样的在艺术创作上的严肃态度。看来，这和大陆上有些一味追求时髦的艺术家是有些不同的。英国的芭蕾舞有着极高的水平，可惜我们到伦敦时，这些芭蕾舞演员都到外国或外地去旅行演出了。然而，一些英国芭蕾舞学生和中国艺术家作了会见。中国艺术家们为他们专门表演了中国古典戏剧训练演员的全部动作和演员的日常躯体练习。这引起了伦敦两个舞剧学校的教授和学生们的极大的兴趣。他们认为这是完整的体系，而且有着奇异的效率。这些未来的英国芭蕾舞明星们也为中国艺术家作了表演，表现了他们普遍具有的极高的才能。
    伦敦的管弦乐队是世界第一流的乐队，而经常举行音乐会的皇家节日音乐厅，是一个现代化的建筑，以它的完美的音响效果而著名。这个音乐厅的包厢好像在墙上不规则地挂着一些鸟笼，许多地方都有着像蜂窝一样的窟窿。椅子的坐垫后面也装有橡皮制的蜂窝一样的东西。在这个大厅中，伦敦交响乐队的庞大的乐队演奏和捷克斯洛伐克著名的斯美唐那四重奏乐团演奏时都有同样清晰动听的效果，而且当大厅中坐满听众或甚至完全没有听众时，也同样不影响音乐演奏效果的质量。
