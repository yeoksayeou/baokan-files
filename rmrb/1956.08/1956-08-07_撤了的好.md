    Good Riddance
    Shang Dui
    The leadership made up its mind to remove the suggestion box hanging in the corridor. The majority of people are very much in favor of it, but a few people have objections, as if: a suggestion box, as the name implies, is for everyone to offer more suggestions and promote democracy. Once it is removed, it is inevitably a bit... well, that.
    This is a big misunderstanding. The leadership's removal of the suggestion box precisely shows that they realize the unreliability of six thin wooden boards, and that what is reliable should be living people and living organizations. From the perspective of the masses, if they have no affection for the leaders they see every day and do not trust them, why should they favor a cold-faced wooden box alone? No wonder the suggestion box is lonely for life. First weekly, then monthly, the box is opened empty and unrewarding, becoming a formality.
    All formalism often gives some people spiritual comfort, but does not help actual matters. Therefore, it is always better to get rid of it. With the removal of formalism, people will think about what to do next.

    撤了的好
    商兑
    领导上下决心撤掉了挂在走廊里的意见箱。多数人是很赞成的，少数人有异议，仿佛是：意见箱，顾名思义，是让大家多提意见，发扬民主的，一旦撤除，未免有些那个。
    这是一个很大的误会。领导上撤除意见箱，正表示觉悟到六片薄木板的不可信赖，可信赖的应该是活的人和活的组织。从群众来说，如果对朝夕见面的领导没有感情，不相信，又何独厚爱于冷着脸的木箱呢？这就无怪意见箱寂寞终身。先是每周、后是按月的空无所获地开箱，成了形式。
    一切形式主义的东西，往往给某些人以精神安慰，却无助于实际事情。所以，总是撤了的好。撤除了形式主义，人们就会去思索下一步该当如何。
