    Japanese People's Movement Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

    The Meteorological Observatory's Joy and Distress
    The Japan Central Meteorological Observatory is currently in a state of both joy and distress. Since June 1st, the Central Meteorological Observatory of the People's Republic of China has been continuously and punctually broadcasting meteorological observation data from various parts of China to Japan, and has also sent the Japan Central Meteorological Observatory a list of meteorological observation points throughout China. These measures by China greatly assist Japan's meteorological observations. The accuracy of weather forecasts issued by the Japan Meteorological Observatory will be greatly improved. Japan's fisheries, navigation, agriculture, and the daily lives of the people will all benefit. Therefore, Japanese newspapers prominently reported these good tidings. Mr. Wada, the director of the Japan Central Meteorological Observatory, and related personnel have continuously expressed their gratitude in newspapers. The Japan Meteorological Observatory Employees' Union, in a state of extreme joy, passed a resolution of thanks, writing letters of gratitude to the Central Meteorological Observatory of China and the Chinese government.
    In stark contrast, the Japan Central Meteorological Observatory and the Japanese people are facing a major source of distress: the United States is testing hydrogen bombs in the Pacific. Despite numerous protests from the Japanese people, the United States has not only failed to stop the tests but has also failed to issue formal advance warnings. The U.S. government merely notified Japan that it would conduct hydrogen bomb tests from April to mid-August. However, no prior notice was given to Japan before any of the hydrogen bomb explosions. Thus, the Japan Meteorological Observatory must mobilize national observation facilities to investigate and study the degree of air pollution day and night, so as to prevent the radioactive contamination of Japan's aquatic products and the health of the Japanese people. The Japanese people read the Meteorological Observatory's reports in the newspapers with trepidation every day. Whenever it rains, citizens call the Meteorological Observatory and various university research laboratories to inquire about the radioactive contamination of rainwater. Dr. Masao Tsuzuki, director of the Japanese Red Cross Hospital, said: "The testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs causes too much suffering to other countries. If you want to test, please go to the moon. Such actions should be prohibited on Earth!" This expresses the sentiments of the Japanese people.
       The Disaster Continues
    The disasters of Hiroshima and Nagasaki continue in Japan today. On May 24th, one of the "atomic bomb girls" of Hiroshima, Tomoko Nakabayashi (27 years old), died in a New York hospital. This news shocked the Japanese people. The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki eleven years ago not only killed countless citizens but also created many "atomic bomb girls." Their originally beautiful faces were disfigured by burns, making their eyes and noses indistinguishable. Those who see their faces cannot help but feel indignant at this brutal act of murder. Last year, some Americans launched an organization with the intention of using plastic surgery to make these disfigured girls' faces look as presentable as possible. Thus, Tomoko Nakabayashi and twenty-four other Hiroshima girls went to New York on May 5th last year. However, over a year has passed, and Tomoko Nakabayashi not only did not regain her original beauty but also lost her life. Her body has been dissected in the United States for "research." The Japanese people will receive her ashes with grief and indignation.
    Hiroichi Fujii, secretary-general of the Hiroshima Prefecture Atomic Bomb Victims Group Council, and three others, representing the atomic bomb victims angered by the death of Tomoko Nakabayashi, met with Kobayashi, the Minister of Health and Welfare of the Japanese government, on June 4th, demanding that the Japanese government provide relief to the still-living atomic bomb victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The lives of these victims are still not guaranteed, and they continue to die one after another. The Japanese government has not allocated any budget for their treatment and relief, only 26 million yen for inspection and research expenses.
    When the First World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held last year, people from various countries donated some relief funds (including 7.2 million yen donated by the Chinese people), and some scattered donations were collected domestically in Japan, accumulating a sum of money. The victims barely received some consolation money. To ensure that these victims receive full relief, the Japanese people are demanding that the government allocate treatment funds in the national budget.
       We Can No Longer Tolerate This
    At the Tokyo Mothers' Conference held on May 22nd, the two thousand attending mothers were heartbroken and wept because of a letter sent by Shizuko Ota from Edogawa Ward, Tokyo. The letter recounted that Ota suffered radiation damage in Hiroshima and gave birth to two children after marriage, one infertile and one born with hereditary atomic disease. She herself also suffers from anemia due to atomic disease and is too weak to work. To support her sick child, she has been forced into prostitution. In grief and anger, the Mothers' Conference passed a resolution prohibiting the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs and petitioned the government. They also collected a donation to rescue Ota from her misery.
    There are countless tragic events like those encountered by Tomoko Nakabayashi and Shizuko Ota in Japan. The Japanese people can no longer tolerate this. The movement demanding the prohibition of the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the movement to relieve atomic bomb victims, have become mass movements involving people from all walks of life and spreading to every corner of the country. Over 38 million of the 80 million Japanese people have signed petitions against atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Kobe City Women's Association and the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb rallies in Tokyo, Higashi-Nagasaki, and other places have launched a movement to write letters to the U.S. President and heads of state of various countries, calling for a ban on the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs. This movement is expanding day by day. Even elementary school students and Japanese women who rarely go out are angrily rising up against atomic weapons. In Yamabuki Village in Nagano Prefecture, elementary school students wrote many slogans prohibiting atomic and hydrogen bombs and posted them all over the village. The village's youth league and women's association collected donations on the streets to relieve atomic bomb victims, raising 7,000 yen.
    Municipal, town, and village assemblies throughout Japan are passing resolutions against hydrogen bomb testing one after another. The chairpersons' meeting of the municipal assemblies of 496 cities nationwide, held in Tokyo on May 23rd, also passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing and requesting the Japanese government to take action on this matter. Both houses of the Japanese Diet also passed similar resolutions.
    Japanese fishermen, who have repeatedly suffered from hydrogen bomb testing, are even more eager to ban hydrogen bomb testing. The Japan Fisheries Association held fishermen's rallies in fishing ports such as Misaki City, Yaizu City, and Irohzaki Town, making resolutions against the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs. On April 18th, various national fishery groups gathered from all over the country and held a national rally against hydrogen bomb testing.
     Prohibiting Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is an Important Task
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) regards the demand for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs as one of the important tasks of its three million members. They have become the core force in the Japanese people's struggle. The All Japan Harbor Workers' Union has issued instructions to harbor workers in major ports such as Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka, instructing them to refuse to unload cargo from ships that cannot prove they are not contaminated with radiation during U.S. hydrogen bomb tests. The Kobe local headquarters of this union directly submitted an application to the U.S. Consul in Kobe, demanding that the United States immediately stop testing hydrogen bombs. The All Japan Seamen's Union demands that the U.S. government take responsibility for the navigational safety of ships of various countries in the Pacific. This demand has been supported by the seamen's unions of China, India, and other countries.
    Under the leadership of the All Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, Japanese students convened the National Student General Uprising Conference on May 16th to stop hydrogen bomb testing and oppose the Japanese government's attempt to revive the Japanese militarist education bill. Tens of thousands of students from dozens of universities across the country, including Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sendai, and Fukuoka, held a series of student rallies and protest gatherings against atomic and hydrogen bombs in various places.
    To express the anger of the Japanese people, the Japanese film industry completed the documentary film "Fortunately We Are Alive!" in June. This is another work that evokes the conscience of the people of the world, following last year's "Children of the Atomic Bomb Disaster." It is a record of the suffering and accusations of the people of Hiroshima who suffered from the atomic bomb disaster for ten years.
    The Great Unity of Peace-Loving People of All Countries
    Many well-known figures from all walks of life in Japan, such as Seiji Kaya, President of the Science Council of Japan, Hideki Yukawa, Director of the Institute for Physical Research at Kyoto University and atomic physicist, Tamon Maeda, Chairman of the Japanese National Commission for UNESCO, and Reverend Takakai Handa of Zenkoji Temple in Nagano Prefecture, have all joined the movement against the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    Currently, the Japanese people are advancing towards the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. To prepare for this conference, an executive committee composed of more than one hundred groups from various circles and more than three hundred and sixty well-known social figures has been organized to carry out the work. The executive committee announced that, building on the success of the first conference last year, and in the new situation of the rapid development of the movement for banning atomic and hydrogen bombs in the world and Japan, this year's second conference will be regarded as "an opportunity for the great unity of peace-loving people of all countries," and "with new confidence, hope, and determination, will make decisions on specific practical issues concerning the future of striving for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and disarmament."

    日本人民要求禁止原子弹氢弹的运动
    蓝海
    气象台的欢喜和苦恼
    日本的中央气象台，现在处在欢喜和苦恼的两种情况中。从六月一日开始，中华人民共和国中央气象台连续地、按时地向日本播送中国各地的气象观测资料，并且给日本中央气象台送来了中国各地气象观测地点表。中国的这些措施，对日本的气象观测有很大的帮助。日本气象台发布天气预报的正确程度，将大大提高。日本的渔业、航海、农业以及人民的日常生活，都蒙受利益。因此，日本报纸显著地报道了这些喜讯。日本中央气象台台长和达以及有关的人士，连续地在报纸上发表感谢的言词。日本气象台职员工会在极度高兴的情绪中通过了感谢决议，向中国中央气象台和中国政府写了感谢信。
    和这完全相反，日本中央气象台和日本人民却遇到了一桩最大的苦恼。那就是美国在太平洋试验氢弹。虽然日本人民提出了无数的抗议，可是美国不但不停止试验，而且不发表正式预告。美国政府只是通知日本说，它要在四月到八月中进行氢弹试验。可是在进行氢弹爆炸时，没有一次事先告知日本。这样，日本气象台必须动员全国的观测设施，白天黑夜调查研究空气的污染度，以使日本的水产业和日本人民的健康避免受到放射能的毒害。日本人民每天带着战战兢兢的心情阅读着报纸上发表的气象台的报告。每当下雨时，市民们纷纷打电话给气象台和各大学研究室，询问雨水的放射能污染情况。日本红十字医院院长都筑正男博士说：“原子弹和氢弹的试验，给予别的国家太大的苦恼。要试验请到月球上去吧，在地球上要禁止这种行动！”这表达了日本人民的心情。
       灾难还在继续着
    广岛、长崎的灾难，今天也还在日本继续着。五月二十四日，广岛的“原子弹姑娘”之一中林智子（二十七岁），在纽约的医院中死去了。这个消息震动了日本人民。十一年前落在广岛、长崎的原子弹，不仅杀死了无数的市民，而且还造成了许多“原子弹姑娘”。她们本来美好的脸上，被烧灼得眼鼻不分。看到她们的脸孔的人们，没有不对这种残暴的杀人罪行感到愤怒的。去年，一些美国人发起成立了一个组织，说是打算用整容手术来使这些变丑了的姑娘的脸孔尽可能修改得像样一些。于是中林智子和其他二十四名广岛姑娘，在去年五月五日到纽约去了。可是一年多过去了，中林智子不但没有回复原来的美丽，而且连生命也丧失了。她的尸体已在美国被解剖“研究”。日本人民将要以悲愤的心情来迎接她的骨灰。
    广岛县原子弹受害者团体协议会事务局长藤居平一等四人，代表由于中林智子的死而激怒了的原子弹受害者们，在六月四日会见了日本政府厚生省大臣小林，要求日本政府救济现在仍然活着的广岛、长崎的原子弹受害者。这些受害者的生命至今毫无保障，继续在一个接一个地死亡。日本政府对于他们没有拨出任何治疗救济的预算经费，只拨出了二千六百万日元的检查、研究费。
    在去年第一届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会举行的时候，各国人民捐赠了一些救济金（其中中国人民捐赠了七百二十万日元），日本国内也收集了一些零星捐款，聚成了一笔经费。受害者们好不容易才分到了一些慰问金。为了使这些受害者完全得到救济，日本人民正在要求政府在国家预算中拨出一笔治疗费。
       再也不能容忍下去了
    在五月二十二日举行的东京母亲大会上，到会的两千名母亲们因为东京江户川区太田静子寄来的一封信而心酸落泪了。那封信中诉说，太田在广岛遭受了放射能的伤害，婚后生了两个孩子，一个不育，一个生下来就带有遗传性的原子病症。她自己也因原子病贫血而身体衰弱，不能劳动。为了抚育有病的孩子，她已沦落到卖淫的火坑中。母亲大会在悲愤中通过了禁止试验原子弹和氢弹的决议，并向政府请愿。她们还凑集了一笔捐款，把太田救出了苦海。
    像中林智子和太田静子所遭遇的这种不幸事件，在日本不知有多少。日本人民再也不能容忍下去了。要求禁止试验和使用原子弹和氢弹的运动以及救济原子弹受害者的运动，已经成为一切阶层人们参加的遍及全国每个角落的群众性运动。八千多万日本人民中，已经有三千八百余万人参加禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名。神户市的妇女会和东京都、东长崎等地的反对原子弹和氢弹大会，又发起了向美国总统和各国元首写信，呼吁禁止试验原子弹和氢弹的运动。这个运动正在一天一天扩大。连小学生和不大出门的日本妇女，也愤怒地起来反对原子武器了。在长野县的山吹村里，小学生们写了许多禁止原子弹和氢弹的标语，在村中到处张贴。村里的青年团和妇女会，在街头募捐救济原子弹受害者，已募集了七千日元。
    日本全国各地的市、町、村议会，一个接着一个地作出了反对试验氢弹的决议。五月二十三日在东京召开的全国496个都市的市议会的议长会议，也通过了要求禁止试验原子弹和氢弹的决议，并要求日本政府为此行动起来。日本国会两院也通过了同样的决议。
    曾经屡次遭受氢弹试验的伤害的日本渔民，要求禁止试验氢弹的心情更为迫切。大日本水产会曾在三崎市、烧津市、屋户岬町等渔港，召开了渔民奋起大会，作出了反对试验原子弹、氢弹的决议。四月十八日那天，全国的各种渔业团体由各地集合起来，召开了反对试验氢弹国民大会。
     禁止原子弹和氢弹是重要任务
    日本工会总评议会把要求禁止原子弹、氢弹作为它所属三百万会员的重要任务之一。他们已经成为日本人民斗争的核心力量。全日本港湾工会并向东京、横滨、川崎、名古屋、神户、大阪等重要港口的港湾工人们发出指示，要他们在美国试验氢弹期间，拒绝为那些不能证明没有沾染放射能的船只卸货。这个工会的神户地方本部，曾直接向美国驻神户领事提出申请书，要求美国立即停止试验氢弹。全日本海员工会要求美国政府对于太平洋上各国船舶的航行安全担负责任。这一要求得到了中国、印度等国的海员工会的支持。
    在全日本学生自治会总联合会的领导下，日本的学生在五月十六日召开了阻止试验氢弹、反对日本政府企图复活日本军国主义教育法案的全国学生总奋起大会。东京、京都、大阪、仙台、福冈等全国几十个大学的十几万学生，在各地召开了一系列的反对原子弹和氢弹的学生大会和抗议集会。
    日本电影界为了体现日本人民的愤怒，在六月间完成了记录电影片“幸而我们活着！”这是继去年“原子弹灾难下的孤儿”之后的又一部激发世界人民良心的作品。它是广岛遭受原子弹灾害的人们十年来的痛苦和控诉的记录。
    爱好和平的各国人民的大团结
    日本各界的许多知名人士，如像日本学术会议议长茅诚司，京都大学物理研究所所长、原子物理学家汤川秀树，联合国教育科学文化组织日本国内委员会会长前田多门，长野县善光寺的半田孝海大法师等人，都投入了反对使用和试验原子弹、氢弹的运动。
    现在，日本人民正在向第二届禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会前进，为了筹备这个大会，已经由一百多个各界团体以及三百六十多名社会知名人士，组织了一个执行委员会进行工作。执行委员会宣布，在去年的第一届大会的成功的基础上，在世界和日本要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动迅速发展的新的形势下，将把今年的第二届大会作为“爱好和平的各国人民大团结的机会”，并且“抱着新的信心、希望和决心，对于争取禁止原子弹和氢弹和裁减军备的今后的具体实践问题，作出决定”。
