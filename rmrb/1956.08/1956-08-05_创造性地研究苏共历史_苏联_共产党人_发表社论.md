Creatively Study the History of the CPSU

Soviet "Communist" Publishes Editorial

The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's theoretical and political journal, "Communist," published a lengthy editorial in its tenth issue: "Striving for the Creative Study of the History of the CPSU." The editorial summarizes and criticizes the personality cult, dogmatism, and subjectivism manifested in the study of the history of the CPSU, and calls for creative engagement in Party history research in accordance with the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The editorial proposes that a popular, fact-based, experience-summarizing, Marxist textbook on Party history should be written. It also calls for work to begin on a multi-volume history of the Party, and for weighty monographs and popular scientific works on important periods and topics in Party history.

To this end, the editorial says, it is necessary to overcome the shortcomings and errors that have existed in the study and teaching of CPSU history for fifteen to twenty years. The editorial points out three major defects: First, Party history events are narrated from the subjectivist standpoint of the personality cult, artificially attributing the victories of the people and the Party to Stalin alone. Therefore, the decisive role of the people is underestimated, and the significance of the Party as the leading force of the people is diminished. Second, dogmatism and bookishness hinder the creative study of Party history. The authors of Party history works do not study events, facts, or documents, do not understand specific historical circumstances, and do not draw independent conclusions, but merely compile and comment on well-known principles. In these works, citations replace life, and praise for Stalin replaces the history of the Party's struggle for socialism. Third, a crude subjectivist method is adopted towards historical events, forgetting that the evaluation of past events requires estimating specific historical conditions and analyzing the causes of the events.

The editorial criticizes "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." The editorial states: "Undoubtedly, the creation of this book is a serious attempt to systematically narrate Party history. In the explanation of certain issues, this book is a step forward compared to previous textbooks. But this textbook contains very serious theoretical and factual shortcomings. In many chapters, such as the chapters on the October Revolution and the Civil War, the role of Lenin is diminished. In the last few chapters, the description of the Party's organizational work is completely unsatisfactory; some historical events are distorted in the book.

The editorial also points out that in the past, the narration of the emergence and development of the CPSU in Party history books often deviated from the world revolutionary movement and was examined in a closed-door manner.

The editorial points out that in past Party history books, insufficient attention was paid to the inheritance relationship between the Communist Party and the forerunners of Russian Marxism-Leninism—the revolutionary democrats. The activities of the revolutionary Populists and the theoretical and political activities of Plekhanov, the founder of Russian Social Democracy, were not objectively evaluated.

The editorial points out that due to the influence of the personality cult, many issues in the early history of the Party were explained incorrectly. For example, some Party history books wrote that at the same time as the St. Petersburg "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" led by Lenin, there existed a second center of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (the Tbilisi Social Democratic organization headed by Stalin), which does not conform to historical facts. For example, some books underestimate the major historical fact that the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party established a Marxist party, exaggerating the significance of the Prague Party Conference and attempting to prove that the Prague Conference established a new type of party.

The editorial points out that the Party's experience in building a new country, a new economy, a new culture, and new labor discipline, as well as new organizational forms and the Party's methods of working among the masses, should be studied deeply and comprehensively. However, Party history researchers are not very clear on how to narrate the issues of this period. For example, the "Short Course" only focuses on explaining how the Party fought against various factions. But this is only one aspect of the Party's activities. For example, some books only superficially explain the Party's economic policies and do not analyze the Party's organizational work.

The editorial concludes by mentioning the need to strengthen the research work of historical science, train cadres to study and teach Party history, give full play to the role of the Marxist-Leninist Institute directly under the Central Committee of the CPSU, and publish specialized journals for studying Party history issues.

### 创造性地研究苏共历史  苏联“共产党人”发表社论

    创造性地研究苏共历史
    苏联“共产党人”发表社论
    苏共中央理论和政治刊物“共产党人”第十期发表了长篇社论：“争取创造性地研究苏共历史”。社论概括地批判了在苏共历史研究中表现的个人崇拜、教条主义、主观主义，要求按照苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，创造性地从事党史研究。社论提出，要写出通俗的、以史实为根据的、总结党的经验的、马克思主义党史教科书，也要着手编写多卷本的党史，还要对党史的重要时期和专题编写有分量的专著和通俗的科学著作。
    为此，社论说，必须克服十五年到二十年来在苏共历史的研究和讲授中存在的缺点和错误。社论指出了三大缺陷：一、从个人崇拜的主观主义立场叙述党史事件，把人民和党的胜利都人为地归功于斯大林一个人。因此对人民群众的决定性作用估价不足，贬低了党之为人民的领导力量的意义。二、教条主义和书呆子习气阻碍了对党史的创造性研究。党史著作的作者们不去研究事件、事实、文献，不去了解具体历史情况，不独立作出结论，只是编述和评论人所尽知的原理。在这些著作中，以引证代替生活，以对斯大林的颂扬代替党为社会主义而斗争的历史。三、对历史事件采取了粗暴的主观主义的方法，忘记了评价过去事情要估计具体的历史条件，分析事件产生的原因。
    社论对“联共党史简明教程”进行了批评。社论说：“无疑的，这本书的创作是有系统地叙述党史的认真尝试。在某些问题的说明上，这本书比较从前的那些教科书前进一步。但是在这本教科书中包含着非常严重的理论和事实方面的缺点。在许多章内，例如在十月革命和国内战争章内，列宁的作用被贬低了。在书的最后几章，对党的组织工作的叙述完全不能令人满意；有些历史事件在书中被歪曲了。
    社论还指出：过去党史书籍中对苏共的产生和发展的叙述，往往脱离世界革命运动，关门主义地加以考察。
    社论指出：共产党与俄国马克思列宁主义的先行者——革命民主主义者的继承关系，在过去党史书籍中注意不够。对革命的民粹派的活动，对俄国社会民主主义奠基人普列哈诺夫的理论和政治活动，都估价得不客观。
    社论指出：由于个人崇拜的影响，对初期党史的许多问题说明得不正确。例如有些党史书籍写过，似乎与列宁所领导的彼得堡“工人阶级解放斗争协会”同时，存在过俄罗斯社会民主工党第二个中心（以斯大林为首的梯比里斯社会民主组织），这是不符合历史事实的。又如有些书籍对俄罗斯社会民主工党第二次代表大会建立了马克思主义政党这个重大历史事实估计不足，夸大了布拉格党代表会议的意义，试图证明布拉格会议建立了新型政党。
    社论指出：应该深刻和全面地研究党在建设新的国家、新的经济、新的文化、新的劳动纪律方面的经验，以及新的组织形式和党在群众中的工作方法。但党史研究者对怎样叙述这个时期的问题不很明确。例如，“简明教程”只集中精力说明党怎样与各派别作斗争。但这只是党的活动的一个方面。又如，有些书籍只表面地说明党的经济政策，没有分析党的组织工作。
    社论最后提到，要加强历史科学的研究工作，培养研究和讲授党史的干部，发挥苏共中央直属马克思列宁主义研究院的作用，出版研究党史问题的专门刊物。        　　（李何）
