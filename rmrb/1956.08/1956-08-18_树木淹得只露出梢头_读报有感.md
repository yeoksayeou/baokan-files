    “Trees Submerged, Only Tops Showing”
    ——Reflections on Reading the Newspaper
    Liu Jia

    It's only natural to care about one's hometown. News in the newspaper about flood prevention in Hebei particularly caught my attention. But as I read on, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Alas!" It turned out that what Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Jiaji saw was precisely the disaster situation in my hometown. According to the reporter: "Approaching Boye, the reporter clearly saw that the flood caused by the typhoon-induced torrential rain had overflowed the riverbanks. Some villages on both sides were surrounded by floodwater, and the crops and trees in the fields were submerged, with only the tops showing."
  (See "People's Daily," first edition, August 8th) I am familiar with the situation in my hometown: the trees are much taller than the houses, and the houses are much taller than people. If only the tops of the trees are showing, wouldn't the houses and people (including my family) and everything else be "gone"?

    However, I immediately calmed down, because I then read that the reporter wrote: "Some disaster victims whose houses were flooded have temporarily moved to higher ground or are living on rooftops." It turns out that the rooftops are still exposed, indicating that the water is not as deep as I had imagined. Reading the previous sentence again, I became even more relieved, because doesn't the previous sentence clearly say that the tops of the crops are also still showing outside the water? The tallest crops in my hometown are sorghum and corn, and their height generally does not exceed that of the houses. Moreover, in our villages on the plains, the location is mostly higher than the farmland. Thus, I judge that only the village is surrounded by water (with some houses destroyed in the middle).

    After the false alarm, I blamed the reporter for considering the crops and trees to be of similar height, and for not speaking clearly, causing people to have a false alarm. However, soon I blamed myself. Didn't the reporter clearly say that he was looking down from an airplane in the sky? Looking down from above, naturally what you see are the tops of the trees and the tops of the crops exposed above the water, and the difference between the two is negligible.

    But I also thought of other things. We often describe those who only look at the appearance of things without deeply observing the essence as taking a fleeting glance. But isn't this flying an airplane to look at trees and crops also a portrayal of that? Of course, surveying floods or air-dropping supplies must be done by plane. It is entirely appropriate for reporters to fly in airplanes to observe the disaster situation, and I have no objection in this regard. I am just saying that making conclusions hastily based on a quick, distant glance at things, and taking what one sees as the truth, is a fairly common way of thinking. This way of thinking has caused some people great suffering and even led to many disputes. As for my false alarm, it is naturally nothing to speak of.

    “树木淹得只露出梢头”
    ——读报有感
    刘甲
    关心家乡是人之常情。报上有关河北防汛的消息就特别引起我的关心。可是，读着读着，就不禁使我拍案大叫：“休矣”。原来新华社记者任家骥所看到的，正是我家乡的灾情。据记者说：“接近博野时，记者清楚地看到由台风引起的暴雨造成的洪水，溢出河堤，两岸部分村庄被积水包围，田野上的庄稼，树木被水淹得只露出梢头。”
  （见八月八日“人民日报”一版）我对家乡的情况是熟悉的：树比房子要高的多，房子又比人高的多。如果树木只露梢头，房子和人（也包括我家）以及一切岂不都“休矣”了吗？
    然而，立即我就冷静下来，因为接着读到记者写的：“有些房屋被淹的灾民，暂时移居在高处或住在屋顶上。”原来屋顶尚露在外，可见水就不像我刚才想像的那样深。再返回头去读前一句话，就越加使我放心了，因为前一句中不是明明说着庄稼梢也还露在水外面吗？家乡一带的庄稼，最高的不过是高粱和玉米，高度一般超不过住屋。何况我们这平原上的村庄，位置大都高于耕地，这样，我判断大约是村庄仅仅被水包围（当中一部分房屋被毁）而已。
    虚惊之余，我就埋怨记者，为什么会把庄稼和树看得一般高，为什么说话说不清，使人白受虚惊。然而，不久我就怪起自己来了。记者不明明是说坐着飞机从天空中往下看的吗？从上往下看自然看到的就是树梢和庄稼梢都露出水面，而且两者所差无几了。
    但是，我也就联想到了别的。我们常把只看事物表象而不深刻观察事物实质的，形容为走马看花，然而这坐飞机看树木和庄稼，不也正是一种写照吗？当然，勘察水灾或是空投都必须坐飞机的。记者坐飞机去观察灾情也完全应该，在这方面我毫无异议。我只是说：对事物匆匆地远远地一看，就轻易地作出结论，而且以眼见为实作据，正是一种相当普遍的思想方法。这种思想方法，却使一些人大受其苦，甚至惹出许多纠纷。至于我的这场虚惊，自然是算不得什么的。
