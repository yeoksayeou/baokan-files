Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 31st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ke Xian): The Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, consisting of thirty-one members and photographers, safely reached the summit of Muztagh Ata at 14:00 today (4:00 PM Beijing time) and planted the national flags of China and the Soviet Union at the 7,546-meter high point.

The Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team members, after six days of arduous marching, finally climbed to a height unprecedented in the mountaineering history of both China and the Soviet Union.

Wearing brown-grey windproof mountaineering suits, the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers set off from the fifth high-altitude camp at 7,200 meters above sea level at 9:00 AM today (local time) to make their final assault on the summit.

The temperature near the summit today was around minus 20 degrees Celsius. The athletes advanced in rope teams, with the four-person team composed of the mountaineering team's deputy leader, Soviet Honored Master of Sports Kuzmin, Honored Master of Sports Ivanov, and Chinese mountaineer Hu Benming, leading the way. Due to the increase in altitude, the athletes were breathing rapidly, and their senses and movements were relatively sluggish. During each rest, they looked at each other without saying much. Only when they noticed a teammate falling behind would they resolutely come down and support each other forward. The athletes took five hours to cover the 346 meters from the fifth high-altitude camp to the summit.

The Chinese and Soviet mountaineers established the fifth high-altitude camp at about 3:00 PM on the 30th (local time) at an altitude of 7,200 meters. That night, the temperature at Camp Five dropped to minus 25 degrees Celsius. Severe shortness of breath caused by a lack of oxygen prevented the athletes from sleeping all night. They only carried the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, walkie-talkies, and cameras for the ascent today to reduce physical exertion.

Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 31st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ke Xian): The captain of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, Berezin, announced to the Xinhua News Agency reporter at the base camp this afternoon using a walkie-talkie on the summit of Muztagh Ata: Now, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union are flying in the wind on the summit of Muztagh Ata.

Berezin said: The thirty-one members of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, after six days of arduous marching, have now reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, which athletes from other countries have longed for but could not climb. He said: Although we still face the numerous difficulties that may be encountered during the descent, we have reason to say that this climb has achieved a major victory. The fact that all thirty-one members of our mountaineering team have reached the summit is an unprecedented event in the years of competition among mountaineers from various countries to conquer the world's peaks.

Berezin said: The tactical basis of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team is: to conduct preparatory work before the assault in a planned manner; to gradually train the team members' adaptability to the high-altitude environment; and to carefully estimate all the difficulties faced during the ascent.

Berezin said: As we fought to climb Muztagh Ata, we strived to learn the noble qualities of diligence and courage displayed by the people of China and the Soviet Union in overcoming various difficulties. He said that the Soviet mountaineers were very happy to have talented and courageous Chinese mountaineers as their companions and students. The twelve Chinese mountaineers gloriously overcame all the difficulties encountered in the assault on the main peak. They are now standing with their Soviet friends on the summit of Muztagh Ata, jointly enjoying the joy of victory.

Berezin concluded by saying that the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers who participated in the ascent of Muztagh Ata have decided to dedicate the victory of this ascent to the cause of consolidating the friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union.

According to Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China sent telegrams to all members of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team today, warmly congratulating them on their successful ascent to the summit of Muztagh Ata and wishing them greater achievements in the mountaineering cause of China and the Soviet Union.

    中苏混合爬山队攀登到慕士塔格山顶
    新华社慕士塔格山31日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队三十一名队员和摄影师今天十四点（即北京时间下午四点）已经全部安全地攀登到慕士塔格山顶，并且把中、苏两国国旗插在7，546公尺高的地方。
    中、苏混合爬山队队员，经过六天的艰苦行军，他们终于攀登到中、苏两国爬山历史上从未有过的高度。
    穿着褐灰色风雨爬山衣的中、苏爬山队员今天上午九时（当地时间）从拔海七千二百公尺处的第五号高山营地出发，向顶峰作最后一次进军。
    今天顶峰附近的温度是摄氏零下二十度左右。运动员们用尼龙绳结组前进，在前边开路的是爬山队副队长、苏联功勋运动员库兹明、功勋运动员伊万诺夫以及中国爬山运动员胡本铭等人组成的四人小组。由于高度的增加，运动员们呼吸急促，感觉和动作都比较迟钝，每当休息时，他们面面相视，不多讲一句话，只有发现同伴掉队时，才毅然下来，互相扶着前进。运动员们用了五个小时，才走完了从第五号高山营地到山顶的346公尺的距离。
    中、苏爬山队员们在三十日下午三时左右（当地时间）在拔海七千二百公尺处建立起第五号高山营地。当天晚上，五号营地的气温降到摄氏零下二十五度。由于氧气缺乏所造成的严重气喘，使运动员们一夜未能睡眠。他们今天只携带着中、苏两国国旗、步行报话机和摄影机等登山，以减少体力消耗。
    新华社慕士塔格山31日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队队长别列次基今天下午在慕士塔格山顶用步行报话机向在宿营基地的新华社记者发表谈话说：现在，中、苏两国国旗正在慕士塔格山顶迎风飘扬。
    别列次基说：中、苏混合爬山队三十一名队员，经过了六天的艰苦行军，现在已经达到了其他国家运动员曾经向往但无法攀登的慕士塔格山顶。他说：虽然还面临着下山时可能碰到的重重困难，但我们有理由说，这次爬山已经取得了重大胜利；我们爬山队三十一名队员全部登上了山顶，是多年以来各国爬山运动员竞相征服世界高峰中所没有见过的事例。
    别列次基说：中、苏混合爬山队的战术基础是：有计划地进行突击前的准备工作；循序渐进地锻炼队员的高山环境适应性；仔细地估计登山时面临的一切困难。
    别列次基说：当我们为攀登慕士塔格山而斗争时，我们努力学习了中、苏两国人民在克服各种困难时所表现出来的勤劳勇敢的高贵品质。他说，苏联爬山队员非常高兴的是，能够有着天才而勇敢的中国爬山运动员作为自己的同伴和学生。十二名中国爬山队员光荣地克服了突击主峰时遇到的一切困难，他们现在和苏联朋友一起站在慕士塔格山顶，共同享受着胜利的欢乐。
    别列次基最后说，这次参加攀登慕士塔格山的中、苏爬山队员已经作出决定：把这次攀登慕士塔格山的胜利，献给为巩固中、苏两国伟大人民的友谊的事业。
    据新华社31日讯　中华全国总工会和中华人民共和国体育运动委员会今天打电报给中、苏混合爬山队全体人员，热烈祝贺他们已经胜利攀登到慕士塔格山的顶峰，并祝他们在中、苏两国的爬山事业中做出更大的成绩。
