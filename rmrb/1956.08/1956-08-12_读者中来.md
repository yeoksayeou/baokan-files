    From the Readers
    Respect the Labor of Authors
    There's a strange trend in the Shanghai Film Studio: When a script that isn't perfect enough is modified by someone else, the modifier can receive royalties, or even become one of the screenwriters. For example, the color puppet film "The Magic Brush," which has been well-received at home and abroad, was written by an amateur author. After the script was adopted, it was handed to the director, who made significant modifications. When the film was released, the author's name was missing from the credits, and only the director's name appeared, preceded by the words "Director and Writer." Another example: two employees of the Shanghai Film Studio co-wrote a puppet film script in their spare time. After a full-time screenwriter offered suggestions, the authors made several revisions, and finally asked the screenwriter for help with further modifications. The screenwriter spent a night revising the script, and as a result, received nearly one-third of the royalties. The above situation has occurred more than once or twice at the Shanghai Film Studio. I believe this is a practice that does not respect the labor of authors and will damage their enthusiasm.　Jiang Yi
    Don't Train Children Like This
    I heard that a primary school teacher in Luxian, Sichuan, wanted to train his five-year-old daughter to be a little singer, and made her get up early every morning to practice her voice. After only a few days, the unteachable little darling would cry whenever she had to practice. The mother had to abandon the planned program and wait until she was older. In Anjuba, Suining, Sichuan, there is a seven-year-old child who can draw a few strokes of sketching. His father forces him to draw every day and sends his "masterpieces" to others to show off.
    Some journalist comrades are particularly interested in the old and the young. An eighty-year-old labor model is more typical than a seventy-year-old one. A little ××'s family who is over ten years old may not be caught in the lens of a photographer. It is of course good and should be praised if an elderly person can work even at the age of ninety. However, six-year-old children should be allowed to play with building blocks and ride rocking horses more!　Deng Yuguang

    读者中来
    尊重作者的劳动
    上海电影制片厂有这么一股怪风气：一些还不够完美的剧本，经过别人修改以后，修改者可以获得稿酬，或者甚至可以成为编剧中的一个。例如在国内外获得好评的彩色木偶片“神笔马良”，是一个业余作者写的。剧本被采用以后，交到导演手里，导演作了较大的修改。电影拍出来了，但是片头上作者的名字却没有了，出现的只有导演一个人的名字，并且前面加上了“编导”二字。又如上海电影制片厂的两个职员，利用业余时间合写了一部木偶片剧本。一位专任编剧提了意见后，作者作了几次修改，最后又请这位编剧帮助修改。编剧花了一夜工夫把剧本改好了，于是也就拿了将近三分之一的稿酬。上述这种情况在上海电影制片厂并不只出现过一两次。我觉得这是不尊重作者劳动的一种做法，会损伤作者的积极性的。　姜薏
    不要这样训练孩子
    我曾听说四川泸县一位小学教员，要把自己的五岁女儿训练成小歌唱家，每天早晨叫她起来练嗓子。不到几天，这个不可教的小宝宝一练嗓子就是哭。妈妈只好放弃预定计划，等她长大些再说。四川遂宁安居坝有个七岁小孩，能画几笔素描，他父亲便每天强迫他画，并且把他的“杰作”送人，以此炫耀。
    有一些记者同志，对老和小特别感到兴趣。八十岁的劳动模范，比七十岁的更典型。上了十岁的小××家，也许就入不了摄影记者的镜头。老年人就是到了九十岁，只要他能劳动，当然是好的，该表扬。但是六岁的儿童，还是多让他们去玩积木、骑木马吧！　邓宇光
