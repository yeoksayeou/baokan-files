    Considering Analogies
    Shi Liuming
    When "avoiding food for fear of choking" is mentioned, perhaps everyone thinks: This is just an old fable, and no one would do it now.
    This is an unrealistic conclusion.
    A passenger at the Jinan City Jianzixiang Bus Station saw a notice from the bus company that read: "According to instructions from higher authorities, in order to do a good job in preventing heatstroke and lowering the temperature, public buses on all lines will reduce the number of trips when the temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent passengers from suffering heatstroke and ensure their safety. Passengers are requested to take the bus according to the passenger capacity. This is a special announcement." With fewer bus trips, the queues of people wanting to take the bus in the scorching sun became longer and longer. At this time, even if passengers suffer from heatstroke, it is certainly not related to the bus company.
    In other aspects, there are also things that abandon the benefits for fear of its disadvantages. Being afraid of workers making "living problems" without trying to understand their lives, and simply dragging out the work of adjusting wages indefinitely because the issue is complex, etc., all belong to this category. This is a lazy approach and must not be allowed to develop. Because, if the temperature is not 100 degrees but 130 degrees, will the buses be reduced even more, or even stop running altogether?

    提起“因噎废食”这句话，或许大家都觉得：这不过是个古老的寓言，现在是不会有人做出来的。
    这是个不切合实际的结论。
    有个乘客，在济南市剪子巷汽车站，看到汽车公司的一个告示，上写：“根据上级指示，为了做好防暑降温工作，各线公共汽车拟在华氏一百度时减少车次，以防止乘客中暑，保证其安全，希乘客按车内定员乘车。特此敬告。”车次减少了，在烈日下想乘车的人排的队愈来愈长。这时，即使乘客中暑，准和汽车公司无关。
    在其他方面，不防其弊而弃其利的事也是有的。怕工人闹“生活问题”而不去了解他们的生活、因调整工资问题复杂索性把这一工作无止境地拖下去等等，都属于这一类。这是一种偷懒的做法，万不能让其发展。因为，如果气温不是100度而是130度，是不是汽车更要减少，甚至停开了呢？
