Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram　Zhang Jinrong, a worker in the foundry workshop of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, completed seven years and ten days of workload from 1953 to July 18 this year, with good quality. The factory's advanced producer selection committee has selected Zhang Jinrong as an advanced producer.

　　Regularly reading books such as "Foundry Worker Monthly," paying attention to improving his technical level, and often humbly asking and learning from advanced producers are important factors in Zhang Jinrong's achievements.

　　Once, when Zhang Jinrong was sent to the Sifang Locomotive Manufacturing Factory to demonstrate the steam mold method, he learned the advanced experience of the factory's veteran masters, such as the "bottom plate leak plate method," which increased work efficiency by twelve times. Recently, when making superheater boxes, he changed the general practice of placing coke and paraffin wax, and used straw ropes instead, which increased production efficiency by more than twice the original. In May of this year, the workshop held an advanced experience learning class, and he also learned from the advanced producer Wang Genpei's ramming sand, turning boxes and other methods in the class, saving more than half of the auxiliary time.

　　Because of his continuous hard study, although the factory has revised the quotas, he still completes an average of about 200% of the quota every month.

    三年半完成七年工作量
    新华社南京电　戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间工人张金荣从1953年起到今年七月十八日为止，完成了七年零十天的工作量，而且工作质量良好。这个厂的先进生产者评选委员会已经评选张金荣为先进生产者。
    经常阅读“铸工月刊”等书籍，注意提高自己的技术水平，并且经常虚心地向先进生产者请教、学习，这是张金荣获得成就的重要因素。
    有一次张金荣被派到四方机车制造厂表演蒸模法的时候，他学习了这个厂老师傅采用的“底板漏板法”等先进经验，工作效率提高十二倍。最近，他在做过热管箱的时候，改变了以前摆焦炭、洋蜡的一般做法，”而用稻草绳来代替，生产效率比原来提高两倍以上。今年五月份，车间举办了先进经验学习班，他又在班里学习了先进生产者王根培的桩砂、翻箱等方法，节省辅助时间一半以上。
    因为他不断地艰苦学习，虽然厂里曾经修改过定额，但是他仍然平均每月完成定额200％左右。
