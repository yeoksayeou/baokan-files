Avoid Blindness, Unleash Enthusiasm
Some Regions in Yunnan Exhibit Serious Deviations in Developing Local Industry

    This year, the Yunnan Provincial Commissioner's Office and county-level local industrial capital construction projects total 198, with 137 completed in the first half of the year, a faster pace of development than in previous years. These newly built projects have already played a certain role in supporting agricultural production. However, in the process of unleashing local enthusiasm, some regions have also exhibited fairly serious blindness.

    This blindness is prominently manifested in the issue of resources. Of the seven coking coal iron plants scheduled for investment and construction this year, only three plants now have a relatively good grasp of resource conditions, equipment, and technology; the others either have iron but no coal, or coal but no iron, or have iron but insufficient ore reserves, or have coal but cannot produce coke. For example, the Zhaotong Coking Coal Iron Plant, when the Provincial Department of Industry sent engineers to guide the start of the furnace, only then discovered that the ore reserves were very small, and the existing ore could only produce a few hundred tons of iron. As soon as the furnace was started, consideration had to be given to how to resettle personnel after the plant was closed. The Lufeng Iron Plant also simply relied on visual inspection and believed that "ore reserves are very large" and "ore is everywhere on the mountain," but when they began preparing materials for construction, they discovered that there was no ore.

    Similar situations exist in coal mines. For example, the Fengyi Coal Mine, before the resources were clarified, had already built five houses and laid the foundations for twenty houses. Later, because no coal could be mined, all the projects were scrapped. The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Region also wants to build a coal mine, but no one knows where the coal is. The Wuding County Coal Mine had already allocated funds in the first quarter, but resources have not yet been found. Cadres of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture insisted at the Provincial Enterprise Company's manager meeting in February this year that an oil pressing plant be established in Mangshi. In reality, there are no rapeseed resources at all, and even if sesame oil, perilla and other oil crops are included, the annual output is less than ten tons. It was not until people were sent to design the plant that they arranged to plant rapeseed.

    Secondly, not enough attention has been paid to production preparation work, especially the training of technicians. Most of the agricultural implement factories built this year only started looking for workers when the civil construction was about to be completed; only after installation began did they discover that the machines were insufficient, the parts were incomplete, the motors were incorrect, and the belts did not fit; only when production was about to begin did they realize that raw materials and tools were lacking. The Wenshan Agricultural Implement Factory was unable to carry out production because it lacked casting and iron melting technicians. The boiler workers, electricians, and technicians who master steam engines, oil presses, and sugar presses needed for the several power plants, oil pressing plants, and sugar factories to be built in various places in the second half of the year have not yet been found.

    The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all localities to pay attention to these situations, and the Provincial Department of Industry has put forward suggestions for improving the work.

### 不要盲目，发挥积极性  云南有些地区在发展地方工业中产生严重的偏向

    不要盲目，发挥积极性
    云南有些地区在发展地方工业中产生严重的偏向
    云南省专署和县属的地方工业基本建设项目，今年共有一九八项，上半年已经完成了一三七项，发展较历年为快。这些新建的工程项目，对支援农业生产已经起了一定的作用。但是，在发挥地方积极性当中，有些地区也产生了相当严重的盲目性。
    这种盲目性突出地表现在资源问题上。今年初确定投资建设的七个焦煤炼铁厂，现在对资源情况、设备和技术较有把握的，只有三个厂；其它不是有铁无煤，便是有煤无铁，或者是有铁但是矿量不够或有了煤而不能炼焦。如昭通焦煤炼铁厂，在省工业厅请了工程师去指导开炉的时候，才发现矿量很少，现有的矿石只能炼几百吨铁，刚刚开炉就要考虑关厂以后人员如何安置。禄丰炼铁厂也是只凭眼睛看看，就认为“矿量很大”、“遍山是矿”，但是在开始备料施工的时候，却发现并没有矿。
    煤矿中也有类似的情况。如凤仪煤矿，资源还没有弄清，就盖好了五间房子和做好了二十间房子的基础，后来因为采不到煤，全部工程报废。红河哈尼族自治区也要建设一个煤矿，但是谁也不知道煤在哪里。武定县煤矿第一季度已经拨款，到现在还没有找到资源。德宏傣族景颇族自治州的干部在今年二月的省企业公司经理会议上，坚持要在芒市办一个榨油厂，实际上根本没有菜籽，连香油、苏子等油料作物算上，年产量还不到十吨，直到派人进行设计的时候，才布置种植菜籽。
    其次，对生产准备工作，特别是对技工的培养，也没有足够重视。今年建设的大部分农具厂，都是土建快要完成了才找工人；开始安装了才发现机器不够，零件不全，马达不对，皮带不合；要生产了才知道原材料和工具缺乏。文山农具厂由于没有翻砂和熔铁技工，结果使生产难以进行。下半年各地要兴建的若干电厂、榨油厂、糖厂所需要的锅炉工、电工和掌握蒸气机、榨油机、榨糖机的技术工人，到现在也还没有着落。
    这些情况，中共云南省委已指示各地注意，省委工业部已提出了改进工作的意见。
