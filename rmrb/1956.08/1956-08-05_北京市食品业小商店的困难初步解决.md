Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Beijing's state-owned commercial departments have helped small food stores overcome difficulties in operation and livelihood, resulting in increased turnover for most of them. For example, the sixty-four small oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar stores in the Qianmen district had a sales volume of over 140,000 yuan in the first quarter, which increased to 177,000 yuan in the second quarter. After implementing consignment sales for more than 800 tobacco and liquor stores citywide in April, sales have increased month by month, with June showing a 50% increase compared to March.

There are more than 4,200 food businesses in Beijing, including pork, beef, and mutton, local produce, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, tobacco and liquor, and catering, most of which are small stores. Their common characteristics are small capital, weak manpower, wide distribution, diverse and scattered goods, and close relationships with nearby residents. Before the industry-wide transformation, many of them faced difficulties, and the situation did not improve after the high tide of socialist transformation.

Starting in the second quarter, the Beijing Third Commercial Bureau and the food, catering, specialized products, food grocery, and candy and pastry companies have separately helped each small store adopt various forms of operation, such as credit consignment sales and cash consignment sales, while also providing assistance in terms of capital and sources of goods. Temporary subsidies were given to households whose income from business operations alone was insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. More than 500 households have received subsidies, and their living difficulties have generally been resolved. Based on the principle of voluntariness, state-owned companies have also helped more than 2,900 small stores form 384 cooperative groups based on industry and region, operating independently and assuming their own profits and losses, guiding them to implement mutual assistance in terms of procurement, capital, and manpower.

Currently, relevant departments are establishing central stores in each industry to lead the cooperative groups in business, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, in order to further resolve and meet the needs of small stores.

    北京市食品业小商店的困难初步解决
    新华社3日讯　北京市国营商业部门帮助食品业的小商店克服经营和生活中的困难，使他们的营业额大部分有了上升。如前门区六十四户油盐酱醋小商店第一季度销货额是十四万多元，第二季度增加到十七万七千元。全市八百多家烟酒小商店，在四月份实行代销以后，销售额逐月上升，六月份比三月份增加50％。
    北京市猪牛羊肉、土产食品、油盐酱醋、烟酒、饮食等七个属于食品商业的行业共有四千二百多户，大部分是小商店。他们的共同特点是资金小、人力弱、分布面广、商品零星多样，和附近居民关系密切。在全行业改造以前，他们当中有许多户就有困难，社会主义改造高潮以后，情况仍没有好转。
    从第二季度开始，北京市第三商业局和食品、饮食、专卖事业、食品杂货、糖果糕点等公司，分别帮助各小商店采取欠款代销、现款代销等多种形式经营，同时从资金和货源上给予帮助。对单靠营业收入还不能维持生活的困难户，给予了临时补助。已得到补助的有五百多户，生活上的困难一般都得到解决。各国营公司还根据自愿原则，帮助二千九百多户小商店按行业按地区组成了三百八十四个分散经营、各负盈亏的合作小组，指导他们在进货、资金和人力等方面实行互助。
    现在有关部门正在根据国务院的指示，在各行业建立在业务上领导合作小组的中心店，以便进一步解决和满足小商店的要求。
