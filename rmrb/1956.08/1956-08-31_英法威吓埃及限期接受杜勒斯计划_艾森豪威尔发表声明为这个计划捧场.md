Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th: On the eve of the "Five-Nation Committee" representatives' departure to Cairo to hold negotiations with Egypt, British and French officials continue to publicly threaten Egypt, attempting to force Egypt to accept the Western-formulated plan for international management of the Suez Canal within a certain timeframe.

The British Foreign Office spokesman stated on August 29th his support for the ultimatum-like statement issued the previous day by the former Suez Canal Company. This statement indicated that if Egypt and the "Five-Nation Committee" could not reach an agreement on the establishment of an international management body within an agreed timeframe, the company would order non-Egyptian pilots and other employees working for the canal to resign.

The United Press International reported on the 29th that the so-called "agreed timeframe" proposed to Egypt in the former Suez Canal Company's statement was decided after the company's meeting with the Five-Nation Committee. This timeframe is from August 30th to September 13th.

French Deputy Foreign Minister Maurice Faure also delivered a speech in Gourdon, France, on the 29th, threatening Egypt.

Faure said that "the French government can never agree to allow the negotiations (between the 'Five-Nation Committee' and Egypt) to fall into lengthy empty talk." He said that if Egypt refuses the Dulles plan, Egypt would bear "grave responsibility," and France would "draw its own conclusions" based on the situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th: U.S. President Eisenhower issued a special statement on August 29th, supporting the plan proposed by Dulles at the London Conference for the so-called "international control" of the Suez Canal. He described the Dulles plan as the best way to "guarantee a peaceful solution to this major problem" and called on all countries to support this plan.

Eisenhower also said that he was pleased that Egyptian President Nasser had agreed to receive representatives of the "Five-Nation Committee."

    英法威吓埃及限期接受杜勒斯计划
    艾森豪威尔发表声明为这个计划捧场
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：在“五国委员会”代表即将前住开罗同埃及举行谈判前夕，英国和法国官方继续对埃及进行公开的威胁，企图迫使埃及在一定期限内接受西方制定的国际管理苏彝士运河的计划。
    英国外交部发言人在8月29日声明支持前苏彝士运河公司在前一天发表的最后通牒式的声明，这个声明表示如果埃及同“五国委员会”不能在商定的期限内就建立国际管理机构问题达成协议，公司就要下令为运河工作的非埃及领航员及其他雇员离职。
    合众社29日消息说，前苏彝士运河公司声明中向埃及提出的所谓“商定的期限”，是公司同五国委员会会谈后决定的。这个期限是从8月30日到9月13日。
    法国外交次长莫里斯·富尔也在29日在法国的古尔当发表威胁埃及的演说。
    富尔说，“法国政府决不能同意使（“五国委员会”同埃及的）谈判陷于长期的空谈”。他说，如果埃及拒绝杜勒斯计划，埃及就要负“严重责任”，法国将根据这种情况“作出自己的结论”。
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔8月29日发表了一篇特别声明，支持杜勒斯在伦敦会议上提出的对苏彝士运河实行所谓“国际管制”的计划。他把杜勒斯计划说成是“保证这个大问题的和平解决”的最好办法，并且要求各国支持这个计划。
    艾森豪威尔又说，他对埃及总统纳赛尔同意接见“五国委员会”代表一事感到高兴。
