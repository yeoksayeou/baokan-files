My Impressions and Thoughts on Inspecting Shaanxi and Gansu
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Member Jie Chonggui

II. Moral Issues

I have spoken of the negative aspects, the reduction of social evils; now let me talk about the positive aspects, the improvement of social morality.

As soon as I boarded the train at Beijing Railway Station, I paid close attention to the service personnel and train staff, and also talked with them. It was easy to see that they were wholeheartedly serving the people. They knew that their work of sweeping the floor, emptying spittoons, serving dishes, providing chopsticks, driving the train, and inspecting the machinery was related to socialist construction. Traveling on the same train were comrades from the People's Liberation Army and cadres from various organizations. By calmly observing their actions and listening to their conversations, I could sense that they were people trained by the new China. They did not talk about drinking, gambling, or womanizing, like the soldiers and officials of the former Kuomintang. They talked about major national affairs and national construction. They did not discuss what more they could ask from the country, but rather what they had done for the country today and what they would do for the country tomorrow.

We stayed in modern hotels in Xi'an and Lanzhou called People's Mansions and Guest Houses. I paid close attention to the service personnel and elevator operators. Many of them were transferred from Shanghai. Their wages were not high, but I admired their spirit of service, their hard work, their inexhaustible patience in answering questions, and their attentiveness. Whenever they had a spare moment, they would read books. Talking with any one of them, one could sense their noble feelings of love and respect for labor. They took pride in labor and service, and they did not serve for tips. They observed labor discipline and opposed laziness, knowing that they were working hard to serve socialist construction. Those of us who have stayed in large hotels in the old society remember the detestable and fearsome "room boys," especially when they demanded tips. Comparing them with the lovable and respectable service personnel of today, one can truly feel the loftiness and greatness of communist morality.

This time I also visited Yan'an, the sacred place of our revolution. The people of Yan'an have been directly influenced by Chairman Mao and possess communist morality, which goes without saying. But I want to mention my visit to a modern, well-equipped general hospital in Yan'an. This hospital was established in 1950 and has sixteen doctors, twenty-three medical assistants, forty-seven nurses, and nine midwives, with 108 steel-framed beds. This hospital must be the most wonderful and unique in the world. Its buildings are carved out of the mountainside, with over a hundred caves excavated by hand, divided into seven rows, like seven stories. The wards, operating rooms, pharmacies, and offices are all caves. The doctors and staff live in the highest row of caves, which is extremely inconvenient to go up and down, and even more difficult on rainy days. This alone shows their spirit of self-sacrifice. This is truly a people's hospital in name and in fact. In recent years, they have treated 100,000 patients, 60% of whom received free treatment, not including those treated at public expense. Although the wards and operating rooms are earthen caves, they are very clean and tidy. The director of the pharmaceutical department is a young woman, said to be a demobilized soldier. Like this young woman and the many doctors, medical assistants, and nurses, most are not local. Some practiced in large cities such as Shanghai and Hankou before liberation, perhaps living the American lifestyle, pursuing personal fame, fortune, and wealth. Their outlook on life at that time was bourgeois hedonism, certainly not serving the people. Now, they live the simplest life, working diligently day and night to serve the people. In recent years, no patient has been denied treatment because they were too poor to pay the fees. They truly do not refuse any patient who comes, and treat any disease. Seeing their character and their spirit of service, I cannot but express my highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to them on behalf of the people. They are truly the loyal servants of the people.

In Xi'an and Lanzhou, I visited the presidents of the People's Courts and the directors of the Public Security Bureaus. I had long discussions with them and other working comrades. We discussed issues of public morality and social customs. They all said that since liberation, through the land reform, socialist transformation, and the agricultural collectivization movement, the relations of production between people have changed, and people's sentiments and customs have also changed accordingly. I asked them what cases the courts heard the most. They said that 70% to 80% were divorce cases. At first, I was greatly surprised. After detailed investigation, I learned that the divorces they were talking about were mostly the most unreasonable marriages formed in the old society by "parents' orders and matchmakers' words." The president of the court said: "We always try our best to mediate divorce cases. We do not grant divorces if they can be avoided. We only grant divorces if it is beneficial to both parties, beneficial to the children, and beneficial to production." I asked them if they had encountered divorces due to fickleness or promiscuity. They unanimously replied: "Very few. There are individual examples, but the divorce cases we handle are mostly unreasonable marriages left over from the old society. As for the new society, in general, the relationship between men and women is very normal. Most of those who get married have genuine love." Now the concept of marriage has fundamentally changed. Young men and women always take working ability as the first condition when choosing a partner. Women participate in production and are respected. All kinds of family disputes in the old society have disappeared. As for hooliganism that harasses and insults women, it exists, and even party members and members of the Communist Youth League are not exempt. But it is not common, and we still need to continue to work hard to promote education.

    我视察陕西甘肃的印象和感想

    二、道德问题
    我讲了消极方面，社会的罪恶减少了；现在让我谈谈积极方面，社会道德提高了。
    在北京火车站一登车，在车中我就留心观察车上的服务员、车务员，也和他们谈话。很容易看出，他们是全心全意为人民服务的。他们知道自己扫地、倒痰盂、端盘子、拿碗筷、开火车、检机器是与建设社会主义有关系的。同车旅行的有解放军同志、有机关干部，冷静地观察他们的动静，听他们聊天，可以感觉出来他们是新中国训练出来的人。他们不谈吃酒打牌玩女人等类的事，像以前国民党的军人和官吏那样。他们谈的是天下大事，国家建设。他们讨论的不是向国家多要些什么，乃是今天给国家作了些什么，明天又要给国家作些什么。
    我们住在西安，兰州的称为人民大厦、交际处的现代化旅馆里。我留心观察的是那些服务员，电梯司机同志。他们很多是从上海调去的。他们的工资并不多，我佩服他们的服务精神，工作紧张、百问不厌，侍候周到，稍有余暇即手不释卷。和他们中的任何一位谈话，就知道他们有热爱和尊敬劳动的高尚感情。他们以劳动、服务为光荣，他们不是为酒钱服务。他们遵守劳动纪律，反对懒惰行为，他们知道自己是在努力为社会主义建设服务。我们住过旧社会的大旅馆的，都记得那些“茶房”的可恶可怕，尤其是当他们要求酒钱的时候，把他们和今日的服务员的人格可爱、可敬对照一下，才真正感到共产主义道德品质的崇高和伟大。
    此次也拜访了我国革命胜地延安。延安人民直接受过毛主席的感染，具有共产主义的道德，是不待言的。但我要提的是我参观了在延安的一座近代化的、设备比较完善的综合性医院。这个医院是1950年成立的，大夫十六人、医士二十三人、护士四十七人、助产士九人，病床108张，皆钢丝床。这个医院要算世界上最奇妙最特别的。它的建筑是在山边靠人工开挖了一百几十个窑洞，分七行列，像七层楼。病房、手术室、药房、办公室都是窑洞。医士和职员们住在最高一层窑洞，上下极不方便，下雨天更困难，从这一点也可看出他们的克己牺牲精神。这真是有名有实的人民医院，几年来他们诊治过十万人，内60％免费，公费治疗的还不在内。病房、手术室虽然是土洞，却很清洁整齐。制药室主任是一位年轻姑娘，据说她是解放军复员军人。像这位姑娘和那许多大夫、医士、护士们，大多数不是本地人。有的解放前在上海、汉口等大城市开业，也许过着美国生活方式，追求个人名利富贵，他们当时的人生观是资产阶级的享乐至上，决非为人民服务。现在，他们过着最简朴的生活，日日夜夜勤勤恳恳在为人民服务，几年来没有病人因为穷，纳不起费而得不到医治。真做到了病人来者不拒，是病就医。我看到了他们的人格和他们的服务精神，我不能不代表人民向他们致崇高的敬礼和衷心的感激，他们真是人民的忠臣。
    在西安、兰州，我拜访了人民法院院长和公安局局长，我和他们以及其他工作同志们座谈很久。我们讨论了人民道德社会风化问题。他们都说，解放以来，经过土地改革、社会主义改造、农业合作化运动，人与人之间生产关系改变了，人情风俗也随着改变了。我问他们法院审讯最多的案子是什么。他们说百分之七、八十是离婚案。初听见，我大吃一惊。详细察考，才知道这里所说的离婚，绝大多数是旧社会由“父母之命媒妁之言”结合成的最不合理的婚姻。法院院长说：“我们对于离婚案，总是尽力调解，可离可不离的，总是不离，惟有对双方有好处、对儿女有好处、对生产有好处，我们才判决离婚。”我问他们，遇见过因为喜新厌旧或淫乱而离婚的没有。他们一致回答说：“很少，个别的例子是有的，我们处理的离婚案大都是旧社会遗留下来的不合理的婚姻。至于新社会，大体说男女关系很正常，若有结婚的，大多是有了纯正的爱情。”现在婚姻观念根本改变了，男女青年选择对象总是以劳动能力为第一条件。妇女们参加了生产，受到尊重，从前旧社会的各种家庭纠纷都一去不复返了。至于玩弄和侮辱妇女的流氓行为，有是有的，连党员团员也不免。但并不普遍，还待我们继续努力宣传教育。
