    Taking Medicine and Accepting Criticism

    Taking medicine is for curing illness, and accepting criticism is for correcting shortcomings or mistakes. Some people would rather take medicine than accept criticism.

    People who conceal their illness and avoid doctors only delay the opportunity for "treatment" and allow the "illness" to develop further. What kind of result will those who conceal their errors and avoid criticism get?

    "Good medicine tastes bitter but is good for curing illness, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but benefits conduct." These two old sayings are still very useful today.

    吃药和听批评
    吃药为了治病，听取批评为了改正缺点或错误。有的人却宁愿吃药，不愿意听取批评。
    讳疾忌医的人，只有耽误了“医”的机会，使“疾”更加发展，那么，讳错误忌批评的人，又会得到什么样的结果呢？
    “良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行”，这两句古话，到现在仍然很有用处。　　　石迢
