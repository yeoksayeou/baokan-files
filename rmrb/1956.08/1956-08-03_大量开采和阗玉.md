Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The Hetian Prefecture in Xinjiang is planning to build a jade processing factory. The Hetian jade, which has not been mined for twenty years, will be extracted in large quantities to meet the needs of special handicraft workers in Beijing and other places.
    Hetian jade is historically famous throughout the country. It has many famous varieties. Among them, the best mutton fat jade is pure white in color, smooth, delicate in texture, hard but not brittle. It is produced on the upper reaches of the Yurungkash River (also known as the White Jade River) in the Kunlun Mountains, on the Black Mountain peaks where the snow never melts all year round. Every year in July and August, the exposed jade in the mountains is washed down with mud and sand by floods, accumulating at the foot of the Black Mountains. Eight hundred kilograms to one thousand kilograms can be picked up every year.

    大量开采和阗玉
    据新华社讯　新疆和阗专区，正在计划修建一座玉石加工厂，已经有二十年无人开采的和阗玉石将被大量开采出来，供应北京等地特种手工艺者的需要。
    和阗玉在历史上闻名全国。它的名种很多，其中最好的脂玉，颜色洁白、润滑、质细、硬而不脆，它产在玉龙喀什河（即百玉河）上流终年冰雪不化的昆仑山山脉的黑山山峰，每年七、八月间山中露头玉石被洪水随泥沙冲下，积沉在黑山山麓，每年可拾到八百公斤到一千公斤。
