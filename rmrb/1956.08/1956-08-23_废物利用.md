Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 18th: Shenyang City has, in the first seven months of this year, collected over two hundred kinds of waste materials scattered in various corners of society and投入 them into industrial production and construction. The utilization of these waste materials has created huge wealth for the country.

The more than 11,100 tons of scrap steel and non-ferrous metals collected in the past seven months have been turned over to various national industrial departments and uniformly allocated to steel plants in Taiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Northeast China. Waste rubber, broken glass, and paper, cloth, cotton, and linen have been used as raw materials for local industries in Liaoning Province and some state-owned industries. After 1,200 tons of waste paper were allocated to paper mills in Shenyang, Andong, Yingkou, Dalian, Fuxin, and other places, the state saved tens of thousands of yuan in raw material costs. After 926 tons of waste rubber were processed by the reclaimed rubber factory, exquisite and durable rubber shoes were produced. Waste collection organizations also selected more than 1,200 kinds of usable machine parts and tools from the collected waste materials and supplied them to many factories in Shenyang.

Shenyang City started its waste collection work in 1952. Now, there are sixteen waste collection stations in the city. Fifty-six supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburban rural areas are also responsible for purchasing waste materials on behalf of the government. The Shenyang Municipal People's Committee attaches great importance to this work and recently issued a notice to the whole city, requesting all people and units in the city to assist the government in doing a good job in this area.

    废物利用
    新华社沈阳18日电　沈阳市在今年以来的七个月里，一共收购了二百多种流散在社会各个角落里的废物投入了工业生产和建设；这些废物被利用起来，给国家创造了巨额的财富。
    在过去七个月里收购起来的一万一千一百多吨废钢铁和有色金属，已经上缴给国家各工业部门，统一调拨给太原、北京、上海、天津及东北各地钢铁厂。废胶、碎玻璃及纸、布、棉、麻，已经作了辽宁省地方工业和部分国营工业的原料。一千二百吨废纸调拨给沈阳、安东、营口、大连、阜新等地造纸厂以后，为国家节省了数十万元的原材料费用。九百二十六吨废胶经过再生胶厂加工以后，又制出了精美耐用的胶鞋。废物收购组织，还从收购来的废物里挑选出了一千二百多种可用的机器零件和工具，供给了沈阳很多工厂。
    沈阳市收购废物的工作，是从1952年开展起来的。现在，全市已经有十六个废物收购站。市郊农村五十六个供销合作社也负责代购废物。沈阳市人民委员会很重视这一工作，最近曾通告全市，要求全市人民、各单位协助政府，做好这一工作。
