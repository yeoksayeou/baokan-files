Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 20th: According to a report in the "Burma Citizen" newspaper on the 19th, the obstacle preventing the finalization of an agreement for the United States to grant loans to Burma is a clause proposed by the United States. This clause demands that the U.S. government or its representatives be allowed to inspect Burmese accounts to understand how the U.S. loans are being used.

The newspaper stated that the Burmese government believes this would limit and restrict Burma's use of the U.S. loans. It is said that the Burmese government is unwilling to accept this condition.

The "Burma Citizen" also reported that Prime Minister U Ba Swe is understood to have written a personal letter to Eisenhower requesting him to clarify issues such as what obligations Burma might have to undertake according to the U.S. Battle Act if it accepts U.S. loans. (According to the provisions of this act, countries receiving U.S. aid are not allowed to export strategic and other important materials to communist countries.) The newspaper said that President Eisenhower assured U Ba Swe that neither the Battle Act nor any other U.S. legislation in this regard would affect Burma, and the loan would not be attached to any political or other conditions.

    美国要缅甸允许检查账目才给贷款
    缅甸政府拒绝接受这个束缚性条件
    新华社仰光20日电　据“缅甸人报”十九日报道，使美国给缅甸贷款的协定不能最后确定的障碍是美国建议的一项条款，这项条款要求允许美国政府或它的代表检查缅甸的账目，了解美国贷款是怎样使用的。
    这家报纸说，缅甸政府认为，这会限制并且约束缅甸对美国贷款的使用。据说，缅甸政府不愿意接受这个条件。
    “缅甸人报”还报道说，据悉，吴巴瑞总理曾写了一封私人信给艾森豪威尔，要求他澄清这样一些问题，例如，如果接受美国贷款的话，根据美国巴特尔法，缅甸可能要承担什么义务。（根据这个法案的规定，接受美援的国家是不准向共产党国家输出战略物资和其他重要物资的。）报纸说，艾森豪威尔总统向吴巴瑞保证，不论是巴特尔法或者是在这方面的任何其他美国立法都不会影响缅甸，贷款将不附有任何政治的或其他性质的条件。
