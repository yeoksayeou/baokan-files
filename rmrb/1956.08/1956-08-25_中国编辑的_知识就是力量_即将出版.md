Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd. The sixth issue of the China-edited "Knowledge is Power" magazine is scheduled to be published on the 26th.

The Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine previously edited five special Chinese editions for young Chinese workers. From the sixth issue onwards, it will be continuously edited and published by the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization. This issue features an article on antibiotics written by Chinese medical scientist Professor Ma Yucheng.

The previous five issues of "Knowledge is Power" magazine introduced new achievements in modern science and technology in a popular style, and have been welcomed by a wide readership in China since their publication.

The "Knowledge is Power" magazine, now edited and published by China, will continue to select and publish some articles from the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine in each issue. Many of the original columns, such as "Helping Young Workers," "Our Dictionary," and "Useful Suggestions and Methods," will be maintained. In addition, some articles will be selected from popular science magazines in People's Democratic countries and capitalist countries, and Chinese scientists and engineers will be widely invited to write articles introducing China's achievements in scientific research and victories on the economic front.

    中国编辑的“知识就是力量”即将出版
    新华社23日讯　中国编辑的“知识就是力量”杂志第六期定二十六日出版。
    苏联“知识就是力量”杂志曾为中国青年工人编辑了五期中文专刊。从第六期起由中华全国科学技术普及协会继续编辑出版。在这一期杂志上，刊有中国医学家马誉澄教授所写的的一篇关于抗生素的文章。
    前五期的“知识就是力量”杂志，用通俗的笔调介绍现代科学技术的新成就，发行以来，受到中国广大读者的欢迎。
    改由中国编辑出版的“知识就是力量”，每期仍将从苏联“知识就是力量”杂志上选择一部分文章发表，原有的许多专栏如“帮助青年工人”、“我们的辞典”、“有益的建议和方法”等将继续设置。另外，将从人民民主国家和资本主义国家的通俗科学杂志上选择一部分文章，并且将广泛邀请中国科学家和工程师们执笔，介绍中国科学研究中的成就和经济战线上的胜利。
