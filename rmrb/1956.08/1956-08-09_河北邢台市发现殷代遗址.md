Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. Recently, an Yin Dynasty site was discovered in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, on the west side of Xingtai Railway Station of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. More than 2,000 pieces of relatively complete stone tools, pottery, bone tools, shell tools, oracle bones, and bronze ware were unearthed from the ground of more than 400 square meters.

Based on the unearthed cultural relics and the relationship of the soil layers, a preliminary analysis suggests that this site may include cultures from three eras: The first layer is from the Warring States period, with unearthed items including pottery fragments printed with characters, as well as shell saws, iron shovels, iron hoes, and other production tools. The second and third layers yielded daily necessities such as pottery li (cauldrons), bone knives, and bone hairpins, as well as production tools such as stone knives, stone axes, and weapons such as bone arrowheads, and tortoise shells and animal bones used for divination. Some of the oracle bones were made of cattle and pig bones, and some were made of tortoise shells. Pottery li were the most numerous among the unearthed items. Two kiln sites were also discovered, with complete fire mouths and smoke outlets. One of the kilns even contained fragments of pottery li. However, the third layer of soil has a moldy green color and differs from the second layer. The pottery li unearthed from the second layer have coarse rope patterns on the surface and short feet, while the pottery li from the third layer have fine rope patterns on the surface and high feet. The second layer belongs to the culture of the late Yin Dynasty and early Zhou Dynasty, and the third layer belongs to the Yin Dynasty culture.

    河北邢台市发现殷代遗址
    新华社保定7日电　最近在河北省邢台市，京汉铁路邢台车站西侧，发现了殷代的一个遗址。在四百多平方公尺的地面下，出土了较完整的石器、陶器、骨器、蚌器、卜骨、铜器等两千多件。
    根据出土的文物和土层的关系初步分析，这个遗址可能包括三个时代的文化：第一层是战国的，出土物有印着文字的陶器残片，还有蚌锯、铁铲、铁钁等生产工具。第二和第三层出土物有陶鬲、骨刀、骨簪等生活用具，有石刀、石斧等生产工具和骨镞等兵器，还有占卜吉凶用的甲骨。甲骨有的是用牛、猪骨制的，有的是用龟甲制的。出土物以陶鬲最多。还发现两座窑址，烧窑的火口、出烟口都很完整，其中一个窑内还有陶鬲残片。但第三层土层带有霉绿色与第二层不同，第二层出土的陶鬲表面绳纹粗壮、足矮，第三层的陶鬲表面绳纹精细、足高。第二层属殷末周初的文化，第三层属殷代文化。
