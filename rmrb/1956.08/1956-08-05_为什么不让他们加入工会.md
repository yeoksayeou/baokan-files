    Why Not Let Them Join the Trade Union
    In Bengbu City, Anhui Province, most of the workers in the joint state-private candy stores are still kept outside the trade union. There is a food industry trade union here, but their conditions for admitting members are very strict. Those who join the union must be active in their work and ideologically progressive. Since 1953, only three or four members have been developed. Even by such strict standards, many workers after the joint state-private partnership fully meet the requirements, not to mention that there are no such provisions in the trade union charter. Responsible comrades of the Bengbu City Food Industry Trade Union, please open the door!

    为什么不让他们加入工会
    安徽省蚌埠市大部分公私合营糖果店里的工人还被关在工会大门之外。这里有一个食品业工会，可是他们吸收会员的条件很严，入会的人都要工作积极、思想进步，从1953年至今才发展了三、四个会员。就是按这样严的条件来衡量，许多公私合营后的工人们也满够条件了，更不用说在工会章程上并没有这样的规定。蚌埠市食品业工会的负责同志们，请你们把大门打开吧！    　　　梁培基
