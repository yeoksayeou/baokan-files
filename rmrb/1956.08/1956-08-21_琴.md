    Qin (Zither)
    Shao Yanxiang
    For two thousand years, the ancient zither has been smashed to pieces by mountains and rivers;
    For two thousand years, "High Mountain Flowing Water" has long become a lost tune.
    The confidant is gone; where has Boya gone again?
    Qin Broken Mouth, Qin Broken Mouth, oh, for eternity.
    We gather the blue-green rocks from Qin Broken Mouth,
    And throw them into the white-crested Yangtze River;
    One, two, three… bridge piers surge from the heart of the river,
    And taut strings of steel beams are strung again.
    Our Yueqin—lies horizontally across the Yangtze River's surface,
    The river water surges, the waves behind pushing the waves ahead…
    People of the past, people of the future,
    Like-minded people, listen to us plucking the zither strings with a "ding-dang"!
    [Note] Qin Broken Mouth quarry, located in Wuhan; the stone is supplied to the bridge and other projects for mixing concrete, etc.

    琴
    邵燕祥
    两千年了，古琴掼碎在山边水旁；
    两千年了，高山流水早成了绝响。
    知音不在，伯牙又到哪儿去了？
    琴断口，琴断口哟，地老天荒。
    我们采来琴断口青色的岩石，
    投进白浪翻滚的长江；
    一座、两座、三座……桥墩从江心涌起，
    又绷上一条条琴弦一样的钢梁。
    我们的月琴——横陈在长江面上，
    江水滔滔，后浪推着前浪……
    过去的人哟，将来的人哟，
    知音的人们，听我们拨动了琴弦丁当！
    〔注〕琴断口采石场，在武汉；石料供给大桥等工程作搅拌混凝土等用。
