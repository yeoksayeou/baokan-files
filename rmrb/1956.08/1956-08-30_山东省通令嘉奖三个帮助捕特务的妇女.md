Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th. The Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently issued a commendation order for Xin Qingyun and two other women from Haiyang County who assisted public security organs in capturing two groups of American-sent secret agents. The commendation order stated that in cracking this case, Xin Qingyun, a woman from Xiaotan Village, Liuge District, Haiyang County, Dong Renfen, a young girl from Dongjia Village, and Zhang Peihua, a young girl from Shaojia Village, fully demonstrated their patriotism and high vigilance in defending socialist construction. When they discovered that the secret agent Li Tianqing and others were behaving suspiciously, they monitored their actions while reporting the suspicious circumstances to the local garrison and public security organs, thus ensuring that their sabotage activities were completely wiped out before they could even begin. In addition to issuing a circular to commend Xin Qingyun, Dong Renfen, and Zhang Peihua for their exemplary patriotic behavior in actively helping the People's Government crack down on counter-revolutionary secret agent cases, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee also awarded them a bonus of one thousand yuan as encouragement.
Prior to this, the Haiyang County People's Committee had awarded them a bonus of two hundred and sixty yuan.

    山东省通令嘉奖三个帮助捕特务的妇女
    新华社济南29日电　山东省人民委员会最近发布了对海阳县辛清云等三个妇女协助公安机关捕获两批美国派遣特务的嘉奖令。嘉奖令说，在破获这一案件中，海阳县留格区小滩村妇女辛清云、董家村小姑娘董仁芬、邵家村小姑娘张佩花等充分表现了爱国主义精神和保卫社会主义建设的高度警惕性。她们发现了特务分子李天庆等行迹鬼祟可疑时，一面监视其行动；一面将可疑情况报告当地驻军和公安机关，因而使他们的阴谋破坏活动尚未展开，即被我一网打尽。山东省人民委员会除通令嘉奖辛清云、董仁芬、张佩花这种主动积极帮助人民政府破获反革命特务案件的模范爱国行为外，还发给奖金一千元以示鼓励。
    在此以前，海阳县人民委员会曾发给她们奖金二百六十元。
