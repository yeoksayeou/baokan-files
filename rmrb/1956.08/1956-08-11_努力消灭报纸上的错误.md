    Many readers have sent letters and made phone calls pointing out errors in our newspaper and reminding us to pay attention to overcoming shortcomings in our work. According to our investigation: From July 1st to 20th, about eighty errors occurred in the newspaper, the vast majority of which were typos and some factual errors. Recently, although the number of errors in the newspaper has decreased somewhat, they still occur frequently.

    After the newspaper was expanded to eight pages, the errors in the newspaper also increased. On the one hand, this is indeed due to the increased workload, and some new comrades have joined the work and lack experience. However, the main reason is that there are shortcomings in our work system and work style. Most of the errors in the newspaper are caused by editors, proofreaders, and telegraphic translation staff. About one-third are due to errors in the original manuscripts, and we have not conducted careful checks or lack the knowledge and information in this area, so we have failed to correct them.

    We recognize that eliminating errors in newspapers requires a lot of work and overcoming many difficulties. We are working from several aspects, such as strengthening the education of editorial staff, strengthening inspection and information work, and improving the work system, to strive to reverse the current situation of continuous errors in the newspaper.

    To more effectively eliminate errors in newspapers, we must also have close cooperation from readers and authors. We hope that the authors of all manuscripts: First, the reported facts must be investigated and verified to ensure that they conform to the actual situation; Second, when quoting data and excerpts, check and verify whether there are any typos. In order to facilitate verification by the editorial department, the author should clearly annotate the detailed source of the quotation; Third, the handwriting should be clear and correct. In addition, we hope that readers will regularly supervise our work, and if they find any errors, they will tell us, spurring and assisting us in eliminating errors in newspapers. The Editor

    努力消灭报纸上的错误
    很多读者来信和电话，指出我们报纸上的错误，提醒我们注意克服工作中的缺点。根据我们的检查：从七月一日至二十日，报纸上共发生错误八十处左右，其中绝大多数是错字以及若干事实的错误；最近，报纸上的错误虽然减少了一些，但还是时常发生。
    报纸改出八版以后，报纸上的错误也增加了，这一方面固然是由于工作量增加，一些新来的同志参加了工作，他们还缺乏经验；但是主要的，还是我们的工作制度和工作作风存在着缺点。报纸上的错误大部分是由于编辑、校对、译电工作人员造成的。也有三分之一左右是原稿有错误，而我们又没有进行认真的检查或者是缺乏这方面的知识和资料，因而未能予以改正。
    我们认识到要消灭报纸上的错误，需要做很多工作和克服很多困难。我们正在从加强对编辑部工作人员的教育、加强检查工作和资料工作、健全工作制度等几个方面着手，努力扭转目前报纸不断发生错误的情况。
    要更有效地消灭报纸上的错误，还必须有读者和作者同我们密切合作。我们希望一切稿件的作者：第一，报道的事实要经过调查核对，使其符合实际情况；第二，引用资料和摘录引文的时候，要核对和检查有没有笔误。为了便于编辑部进行核对，作者要把引文的详细出处注解明白；第三，字迹要写得清楚、正确。另外，希望读者经常监督我们的工作，发现错误就告诉我们，鞭策和协助我们消灭报纸上的错误。　编者
