Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: The Ministry of Foreign Trade convened a national conference of directors and special commissioners of foreign trade bureaus to review the completion of the national import and export plan for the first half of the year and to study how to mobilize all forces and positive factors to ensure the completion of this year's import and export plan.

The meeting believed that although the import and export plan for the first half of the year was close to completing half of the annual plan, the purchase and import plans were poorly completed, and the completion of the plan by various companies and provinces and cities was very uneven, with some completing well and some completing poorly. The actual results of purchasing and importing some important commodities were even lower than the results of the same period last year. This has created a very tense situation for completing the entire plan in the second half of the year.

The meeting analyzed the export goods situation in the second half of the year, and believed that although the sources of export goods were generally tight, not everything was tight, but there was tightness and looseness. Some commodities are tighter in areas with convenient transportation, and looser in remote areas. Materials related to basic construction, such as steel and cement, certain important materials urgently needed for domestic industrial production and the market, and certain sideline products that are not arranged for production according to the season, will continue to be in short supply; however, since May of this year, all regions have attached importance to developing various sideline productions under the promotion of ensuring that more than 90% of the commune members increase their income according to the instructions of the central government, coupled with the high production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers, some sideline products will increase production significantly, which provides favorable conditions for supplying domestic needs and meeting export needs.

The meeting believed that doing a good job in organizing the sources of export goods is the key to ensuring the completion of the annual import and export plan. The meeting decided to make appropriate adjustments to the purchase, import, and export plans for the second half of the year, appropriately reducing the export volume of certain commodities with insufficient sources of goods, and at the same time appropriately increasing the export volume of certain commodities with potential sources of goods, taking appropriate care of domestic needs on the one hand, and ensuring the foreign exchange income necessary for the country to import from abroad on the other hand. The meeting decided to take the following measures: First, foreign trade administrative and business units at all levels must go deep into the production areas to urge and assist relevant supply departments to carry out purchases and deliveries, and explore and organize other sources of goods available for export, and oppose waiting for goods to come to the door and shouting about shortages. For export goods that have been included in the allocation plan and supply contract, the supply department must not fail to deliver goods according to the plan and contract; the foreign trade department must also accept goods according to the plan and contract, and must never refuse to accept goods even if the situation in the foreign market changes and they cannot be sold abroad. Second, comprehensively arrange for export goods, and overcome the problem of only paying attention to managing common goods and not paying attention to managing the various small native products, small foods, and small daily-use industrial products within and outside the plan. All regions should pay attention to combining the development of agricultural and sideline production to timely arrange the production and purchase of important export commodities. All regions must specifically implement the production methods of specialized factories for export industrial products that have been approved by the State Council. In order to improve the purchase and import work, concentrated production and large quantities of goods should be purchased directly from the place of origin and factories whenever possible, and transported directly to the port, reducing unnecessary links, saving costs, and reducing costs. Export commodities should be processed locally as much as possible, and relevant companies should send people to the processing sites to check the quality and specifications of processed products. Commodity inspection departments should gradually expand on-site inspection and resident factory inspection work. Third, in order to support the development of export material production, all regions should check the current purchase prices of export commodities; if the purchase prices of certain export agricultural and sideline products are indeed too low, they can be appropriately increased after formulating a plan and reporting it to the leading agency for approval.

The meeting also studied how to give full play to the active role of joint state-private import and export enterprises and their personnel, and decided that foreign trade bureaus in various ports and individual provinces should establish import and export business improvement committees, and state-owned import and export companies in various ports should establish business improvement offices, absorbing personnel with expertise and experience in business from both the public and private sectors to participate, responsible for checking and studying various problems existing in the business, discovering shortcomings and errors, and proposing improvement methods for the leadership to adopt. At the same time, in addition to boldly selecting and using employees in joint state-private import and export enterprises, private personnel should also be given work for everyone, and they should be boldly absorbed into foreign trade administrative agencies and business units at all levels according to their strengths and assigned appropriate work. In order to give play to the business expertise of joint state-private import and export enterprises and meet the needs of the increasingly developing import and export business, the meeting determined that for some joint ventures with overly large institutions and relatively complicated business operations, the products should be appropriately subdivided and more business units should be established.

This meeting was held in Beijing from July 23rd to August 4th.

    对外贸易部研究如何完成今年进出口计划
    决定作好出口货源的组织工作
    据新华社11日讯　对外贸易部召开全国对外贸易局长、特派员会议，检查今年上半年国家进出口计划完成的情况，研究了如何动员一切力量和积极因素，保证完成今年的进出口计划。
    会议认为，上半年进出口计划虽然接近完成全年计划的一半，但是收购和进货计划完成较差，各公司、各省市完成计划很不平衡，有的完成好，有的完成差，一部分重要商品的收购、进货实绩还低于去年同期的实绩。这就造成了下半年完成全部计划的十分紧张的局面。
    会议分析了下半年出口货源情况，认为虽然总的说来出口货源是紧张的。但并不是一切都紧，而是有紧有松。交通便利地区有些商品较紧，偏僻地区较松。有关基本建设的材料如钢材、水泥等，和国内工业生产及市场急需的某些重要物资以及没有按季节安排生产的某些副业产品，货源将会继续紧张；但是由于今年5月以后，各地根据中央指示在保证90％以上社员增加收入的推动下都重视了发展各种副业生产，加以广大农民生产情绪高涨，所以有些副业产品将会增产较多，这就为供应国内和满足出口需要提供了有利条件。
    会议认为，作好出口货源的组织工作，是保证全年进出口计划完成的关键。会议决定对下半年收购、进货和出口计划作适当调整，适当减少了某些货源不足的商品的出口量，同时适当增加了某些货源有潜力的商品的出口量，一方面适当照顾国内需要，另一方面也要保证国家自国外进口所必需的外汇收入。会议决定采取以下办法：第一，各级对外贸易行政和企业单位必须深入产地，督促和协助有关供货部门进行收购和交货，并且发掘和组织其它可供出口的货源，反对等货上门、空喊缺货的作法。凡是订入了调拨计划和供应合同中的出口货物，供货部门不能随便不按计划和合同交货；对外贸易部门也要按照计划和合同收货，即使国外市场情况发生变化而不能外销时，也绝不许拒收。第二，全面安排出口货源，克服只重视经营大路货而不重视经营计划内和计划外的多种多样的小土产、小食品和小型的日用工业品的毛病。各地应当注意结合农副业生产的发展，及时安排重要的出口商品的生产和收购工作。各地必须具体贯彻执行国务院已经批准的出口工业品专厂生产办法。为了改进收购、进货工作，应当对生产集中、数量较大的商品在可能条件下实行从产地和工厂直接进货，直运口岸，减少不必要的环节，节省费用，降低成本。出口商品要尽可能就地加工，有关公司应当派人深入加工场所，检查加工产品的品质规格。商品检验部门应当逐步扩大产地检验和驻厂检验工作。第三，为了扶植出口物资生产的发展，各地应当检查现在出口商品的收购价格；某些出口农业副产品的收购价格如果确实偏低的，在拟定方案报领导机关批准以后可以适当提高。
    会议还研究了怎样充分发挥公私合营进出口企业及其人员的积极作用问题，决定各口岸和个别省的对外贸易局成立进出口业务改进委员会，各口岸国营进出口公司成立业务改进室，吸收公私双方对业务有专长有经验的人员参加，负责检查和研究业务中存在的各种问题，发现缺点和错误，提出改进办法，供领导上采用。同时，除了对公私合营进出口企业中的职工要放手选拔使用以外，对私方人员也要使他们人人有工作，并且要根据他们所长，放手吸收他们到各级对外贸易行政机关和企业单位，分配给适当工作。为了发挥公私合营进出口企业的经营专长，和适应日益发展的进出口业务的需要，会议确定对一部分机构过于庞大、经营商品比较繁杂的合营企业，以商品为对象适当分细一些，适当多建立一些企业单位。
    这次会议在七月二十三日到八月四日在北京召开。
