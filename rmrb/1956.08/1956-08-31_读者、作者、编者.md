    Newspapers Should Strive for Timeliness

    Currently, a serious shortcoming of newspapers published in Beijing (including the People's Daily) is a neglect of timeliness. Not only are items that should be published early often delayed, but readers sometimes don't receive the newspaper until 12 noon, turning a "daily" into an evening paper. Because newspapers are consistently late, people are forced to use work time to read them, or must wait until noon or evening.

    We oppose the view of "time first-ism," but we must also oppose the laziness and bureaucratic style that hides behind the banner of opposing it. The news and articles published in newspapers must first strive for accuracy, but this does not allow us to ignore the principle of "fast." We should attract more readers and expand the influence of the newspaper with more efficient work.

    Do Not Neglect Book Review Work

    The People's Daily, after its revision, rarely publishes book review articles. Up to now, I have not seen a single article reviewing newly published novels. The newspaper also does very little to introduce and review literary theory books. For example, several books on the history of Chinese literature have been published, such as "A Preliminary Draft of the History of New Chinese Literature." If the newspaper were to compare and comment on these books, it would be of great help to readers.

    Now that we are implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," it is even more necessary to strengthen book review work. Newspapers should take on the responsibility of helping readers choose reading materials.

    Does the Daye Iron Mine Area Have Thousands of Cars?

    The People's Daily published a news report on August 17th on the first page by Xinhua News Agency reporters Feng Jian and Yao Changgan entitled "Construction Accelerates in Daye Iron Mine Area." This report stated: "Thousands of large dump trucks, along the mountain roads that wind like belts, speed back and forth." The so-called number of thousands of cars is incorrect. According to my understanding, the Daye Iron Mine actually only has more than fifty dump trucks.

    According to the news report, the Daye mining area now has "thousands of mine builders." Why are there thousands of cars? Does this mining area only have drivers, and no one else doing other work?

    Such errors must be corrected.

    Why Are Two Numbers Different?

    Ye Guoshu's letter: In the article "Sixty Years and Six Years" by Wang Jingyu on the seventh page of the People's Daily on July 13th, it was mentioned: "In the first Five-Year Plan, the planned number of newly built cotton textile factories was thirty-eight." However, in the 14th issue of the Chinese Textile Journal in 1955, Minister Jiang Guangnai said in "Striving to Successfully Complete the First Five-Year Plan for the Textile Industry": "In the five years from 1953 to 1957, a total of thirty-nine larger textile factories are being constructed." Are these two numbers the same thing, or different?

    Wang Jingyu's reply: The article "Sixty Years and Six Years" mentioned that "in the first Five-Year Plan, the planned number of newly built cotton textile factories was thirty-eight," based on the figure on page 63 of the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China." This only refers to cotton textile factories. Minister Jiang Guangnai's mention of "thirty-nine larger textile factories" did not specify that they were only cotton textile factories, so the two numbers are different.

    报纸应该注意争取时间
    目前，北京出版的报纸（包括人民日报在内）一个严重的缺点是忽视争取时间，不仅常常把应该早登的东西迟登了，而且读者有时要到中午十二点钟才能收到报纸，这样“日报”就变成晚报了。由于报纸总是姗姗来迟，使人们只好占用一些工作时间或者只好到中午或晚上再去看报。
    我们反对时间第一论的观点，我们同样要反对躲在这种反对旗帜下的懒惰和官僚作风。报纸刊登的消息、文章首先要力求正确，但这决不是允许我们可以忽视“快”的原则。应该以更有效率的工作去吸引更多的读者，扩大报纸的影响。

    不要忽视图书评论的工作
    改版后的人民日报，很少刊登图书评论的文章。到现在，我还没有看到一篇评论新出版的小说的文章。报纸对于文艺理论书籍的评介工作，也做的很少。例如关于中国文学史，目前已出版了好几种，如中国新文学史初稿等。报纸如果把这几种书加以比较、评论，对读者将有很大的帮助。
    现在正在贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，加强图书评论工作就更加需要。报纸应该担负起帮助读者挑选读物的责任。楼汝棠
    大冶铁矿区有数千辆汽车吗？
    八月十七日人民日报一版登载了新华社记者冯健、姚昌淦同志报道的“大冶铁矿区建设加速进行”的新闻。这篇稿件是这样叙述的：“数千辆大型自卸汽车，沿着像带子一样盘山而上的登山公路，往返疾驰”。所谓数千辆汽车的数目是错误的，据我了解，大冶铁矿实际只有自卸汽车五十多辆。
    根据新闻报道看来，大冶矿区现在有“数千名矿山建设者”，为什么汽车就有数千辆呢？难道这个矿区除了驾驶汽车的司机以外，没有人做其他的工作吗？
    这样的错误必须纠正。

    两个数字为什么不同
    叶国树的来信：七月十三日人民日报第七版汪敬虞所作“六十年和六年”一文中提到：“在第一个五年计划中，新建的棉纺织厂，计划为三十八个”。但是，1955年第十四期中国纺织刊物所载蒋光鼐部长“为胜利完成纺织工业第一个五年计划而奋斗”中却说：“1953年到1957年的五年内，进行建设的共有三十九个规模较大的纺织厂”，这两个数字是两回事，还是一回事？
    汪敬虞的复信：“六十年和六年”一文中提到“在第一个五年计划中，新建的棉纺织厂，计划为三十八个”，系根据“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”第六十三页上的数字。这只是指棉纺织厂。蒋光鼐部长所提到的“三十九个规模较大的纺织厂”，没有说明只是指棉纺织厂，所以两个数字不同。
