Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: The "Liberation of Taiwan Exhibition" held in Guangzhou closed on the 7th.

Over the past month and a half of the exhibition, it has been visited by a total of 554,000 people from all over Guangdong, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, and returned overseas Chinese. The visitors expressed their resentment towards American imperialism's occupation of our territory, Taiwan, and extended their deep sympathy to the Taiwanese compatriots who are in dire straits. They also hoped that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, in the spirit of "patriotism as one family" as stated by Premier Zhou Enlai, would break away from the shackles of American imperialism as soon as possible, strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland.

Many former Kuomintang military and government personnel in Guangzhou, after visiting the exhibition, wrote letters or articles advising the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan to work towards promoting the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Many relatives and family members of Chiang's soldiers, after visiting the exhibition, expressed their intention to find ways to inform their relatives in Taiwan, hoping that they would return home to reunite and live peaceful and happy lives as soon as possible.

    解放台湾展览会在广州展览结束
    新华社广州8日电　在广州市展出的“解放台湾展览会”在七日闭幕。
    展览会展出一个半月以来，前往参观的有广东各地人民，香港、澳门同胞和海外归国华侨等共五十五万四千多人次。参观的人对美国帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾都表示愤恨，对处在水深火热中的台湾同胞寄予深切的同情，并且希望台湾国民党军政人员本着周恩来总理所说的“爱国一家”的精神，及早摆脱美国帝国主义的束缚，争取和平解放台湾，使台湾重归祖国怀抱。
    许多在广州市的前国民党军政人员在参观了展览会以后，写信或撰文劝告在台湾的国民党军政人员，要他们为促进和平解放台湾而努力。许多蒋军亲友和家属在参观后表示要设法通知在台湾的亲人，希望他们早日回家团聚，过安宁幸福的日子。
