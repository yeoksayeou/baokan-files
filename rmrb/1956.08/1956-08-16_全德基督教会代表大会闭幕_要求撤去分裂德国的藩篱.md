Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 14th: A dispatch from Frankfurt am Main: The Seventh All-German Protestant Church Congress, held in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, on the 8th, concluded on the 12th. The chairman of the congress, Tadden-Teglaff, pointed out at the closing meeting that the congress had proven how much we suffered from the division of Germany. He demanded the removal of the barriers separating Germans.

During group discussions at the congress, Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic who attended the meeting, expressed the hope that the congress would support the position of the World Council of Churches against atomic and hydrogen bomb tests.

However, Gerstenmaier, President of the West German Federal Parliament, expressed his desire for the congress to influence believers to pray and sing hymns more, and pay less attention to politics.

Dietmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and a delegate to the congress, spoke to a reporter from "Freies Volk" about his impressions of attending the congress. He pointed out that most of the delegates believed that West Germany's implementation of conscription was a serious obstacle to the reunification of Germany, and they expressed the hope to strengthen the struggle against arming West Germany. At the same time, he expressed regret that the congress, due to obstruction by the Bonn authorities, had not contributed to reconciliation and rapprochement between East and West Germany.

    新华社柏林14日电　美因河畔法兰克福消息：八日在西德美因河畔法兰克福举行的第七届全德基督教会代表大会，已经在十二日闭幕。大会主席塔登—特格拉夫在闭幕会议上指出：这次代表大会已经证明，德国的分裂使我们遭受了多大的痛苦。他要求撤去把德国人分隔开来的藩篱。
    在大会举行分组讨论的时候，出席会议的德意志民主共和国副总理努舍克表示希望大会支持基督教会的世界组织反对原子弹和氢弹试验的立场。
    但是西德联邦议院主席格斯登美尔却表示要代表大会影响教徒多祈祷多唱赞美诗，而少关心政治。
    参加大会的代表、民主德国人民议院主席狄克曼向“自由人民报”记者谈到参加大会的观感。他指出：参加大会的大多数人都认为西德实行征兵是对德国重新统一的严重障碍，他们并且表示希望加强反对武装西德的斗争。同时，他对大会由于受到波恩当局的阻挠而没有对东西德之间的和解和接近作出贡献表示遗憾。
