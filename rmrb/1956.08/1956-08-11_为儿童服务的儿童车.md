    Children's Tricycle Serving Children
    Wu Qi
    The number of children's tricycles running through the streets and alleys of Beijing is increasing. Last spring, there were only a few, but by July of this year, the number had grown to 213, transporting four to five thousand children every day. These children's tricycles are safe and convenient, and are very popular with parents. One afternoon, I visited the tricycle worker Niu Chengzhi, and it proved to be true.
    At 5:30 in the afternoon, Niu Chengzhi rode his yellow and green children's tricycle to the Fourth Nursery Station in the Dongsi District. This children's tricycle looks like a small train car, with screens on both sides and white curtains to shield from the sun. Along both sides of the car are two rows of soft seats.
    When the children saw Niu Chengzhi, it was as if they saw a relative. They shouted "Uncle Niu," grabbed his hand, hugged his legs, and some even reached out their little hands for him to hold them.
    "The first group of children should go home," he said to the children.
    Immediately, seven or eight children waved goodbye to the nanny and said, "Goodbye," then pulled his hand, singing and jumping, and ran outside. Niu Chengzhi picked up the children one by one, helped them into the car, made them sit down properly, closed the car door tightly, and then rode off slowly. When the road was uneven or the traffic was crowded, he would get off and push the car slowly, so as not to let the children be jolted in the car. He said: "When pulling a children's tricycle, special attention must be paid to safety, and there must be no mistakes."
    Niu Chengzhi now picks up and drops off twenty children every day. He cares for these children as if they were his own, and he is familiar with each child's temperament. A little girl named Bai Jun often hits her younger sister at home. Every morning when he picks her up to go to the nursery station, he always asks, "Did Xiao Baijun hit her younger sister at home?" If the answer is "Yes," he kindly advises, "It's not right for an older sister to hit her younger sister..." If the answer is "No," he immediately praises her for being good, and when he arrives at the nursery station, he tells the nanny in front of the children, "Xiao Baijun didn't hit her younger sister at home." The nanny also praises her immediately. Now, Xiao Baijun has truly become a good older sister.
    Niu Chengzhi also often carries a small notebook in his pocket, on which he records the nannies' opinions of the parents and the parents' opinions of the nursery station. Because he often helps to convey opinions between the two parties, he has established close contact between the nursery station and the parents, which has greatly helped the nursery station improve its work. Therefore, the head of the nursery station said: "Comrade Lao Niu is our nursery station's liaison officer." (Attached picture)

    为儿童服务的儿童车
    吴奇
    在北京市的大街小巷奔驰的儿童三轮车，越来越多了。去年春天还只有少数的几辆，到今年七月已发展到二百一十三辆，每天接送的儿童有四、五千人。这种儿童车既安全又方便，很受家长们的欢迎。有一天的下午，我去访问了儿童车工人牛成志，证明确实是这样。
    下午五时半，牛成志骑着黄绿两色的儿童三轮车，向东四区第四托儿站去了。这儿童三轮车好像是一节小火车箱，两边有纱窗，还有白色的窗帘遮太阳，靠车箱的两边是两排柔软的座位。
    孩子见了牛成志好像见了亲人一样，一面喊着“牛叔叔”，一面拉着他的手，抱着他的腿，有的还伸出小手要他抱一抱。
    “第一班走的小朋友该回家了，”他对孩子们说。
    立即有七、八个孩子向阿姨招手说：“再见”，就拉着他的手唱着，跳着向门外跑。牛成志把孩子一个一个抱上车，让他们坐好，把车门关牢，就骑上车缓缓地走了。遇路不平，或车辆拥挤时，他就下来推着车慢慢走，不让孩子在车上受颠簸。他说：“拉儿童车要特别注意安全，不能有一点差错。”
    牛成志现在每天要接送二十个孩子，他对这些孩子像对自己的孩子一样爱护，每一个孩子的脾气，他都熟悉。一个名叫白俊的小女孩，在家常打她妹妹，他每天早上接她上托儿站时，总要问一句：“小白俊在家打妹妹没有？”“打了，”他就亲切地劝说：“当姐姐的打妹妹可不对……”。如果回答的是“没有”，他就马上表扬她好，到托儿站就当着孩子的面对阿姨说：“小白俊在家没有打妹妹。”阿姨也马上表扬她。现在小白俊可真成了一个好姐姐了。
    牛成志口袋里还经常带着一个小本子，小本上记录着阿姨对家长和家长对托儿站的意见。由于他经常帮助双方传达意见，使托儿站和家长取得了密切的联系，对帮助托儿站改进工作起了很大作用。所以托儿站站长说：“老牛同志是我们托儿站的联络员。”（附图片）
    孩子们坐在舒适的儿童车里，高高兴兴地到幼儿园去！
    结束了一天的愉快生活，儿童车分别把孩子们送回家。
