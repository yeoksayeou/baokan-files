Colonialists, Take a Rest!
Wang Zhixiang

Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs are two basic principles of modern international relations and international law. Only by adhering to these principles can the principles of mutual non-aggression, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence be realized. Any country, within its territory, can take all measures it deems necessary to exercise sovereignty and safeguard the interests of the state and its people. Recently, President Nasser of the Egyptian Republic announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal within Egyptian territory and declared that he would guarantee respect for freedom of navigation through the canal. This measure is a sovereign act that the Egyptian Republic, as an independent and autonomous country, is entitled to take, and is reasonable and correct both legally and practically. Therefore, in principle, there is no reason to criticize or refute Egypt's sovereign actions.

Precisely because of this, since Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, we have not heard any reason from the British and French sides to prove that their opposition is justified and their claims are correct. These old-fashioned colonialists have even announced the "freezing of Egyptian funds" and even issued so-called "military preparation" orders, etc., stubbornly and unreasonably treating the problem. This will not scare the Egyptian people, solve the problem, or gain the support of the people of the world.

Historically, in 1854, the Frenchman Lesseps requested the Governor of Egypt to allow the construction of a canal through Egyptian territory to connect the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea to facilitate transportation, so as to avoid the dangers of sailing around the Cape of Good Hope. Egypt accepted this suggestion, and the canal was jointly operated by Egypt and France, starting in 1859 and completed in 1869. Britain later bought most of the shares from the Egyptian side and joined the Suez Canal Company. The international conference held in Constantinople in 1888 decided to open the Suez Canal and allow ships of all countries to pass, regardless of warships, merchant ships, belligerents, neutrals, peacetime, or wartime, and clearly agreed that there should be no acts of war in the canal. It can be seen that the only significance of the Suez Canal in international relations is the convenience of international transportation. Since 1869, Egypt has used the canal in its territory for international transportation services, which has now lasted for eighty-seven years, and will continue to serve international navigation in the future. The people of the world should thank the Egyptian people for their contribution to international transportation.

Now, the independent Egyptian government and people, in order to safeguard national sovereignty and interests, have nationalized the Suez Canal and guaranteed freedom of navigation. This is completely reasonable. We firmly believe that the Egyptian people, with their high culture and rich experience in this canal, will be able to operate it better and serve international transportation.

Those who hold shares in the Suez Canal Company cannot prevent the Egyptian government from nationalizing the canal. Obviously, the rights of shares cannot be compared with the territorial sovereignty of a country, and all the shares cannot affect the sovereignty of the country. Moreover, the Egyptian government has promised to compensate the shareholders for their shares, so this excuse has no basis. If colonialists insist on creating international disputes, they will not only fail to solve the problem, but they must bear all the responsibility for causing international tension and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. For the Suez Canal issue, any so-called "international control" or "international court" solution proposed by the colonialists is far-fetched and cannot be established. Only by respecting the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, recognizing Egypt's nationalization measures, and discussing various issues related to the liquidation of the company is the correct and only way; only in this way can the goal of mutual benefit be achieved.

In the past many years, British and French colonialists have exploited the interests of the Egyptian people directly or indirectly through the Suez Canal, which is difficult to estimate. The current era is different, it is not the era of monopolizing maritime hegemony, nor is it the era of dividing the land of Asian and African countries and arbitrarily plundering. The golden age of colonialists who have long enslaved the people of other countries in pursuit of profit has passed. For the survival of their respective countries and nations, the people of Asia and Africa will never allow colonialism to continue to run rampant for a long time. The so-called "99 years" long-term oppression tricks adopted by colonialists in the past will not work now and must be abandoned. Colonialists, take a rest!

    殖民主义者可以休矣！
    王之相
    互相尊重领土主权、互不干涉内政，这是现代国际关系和国际法上的两项基本原则。只有遵守这种原则，才能实现互不侵犯、平等互利、和平共处的原则。任何国家在它的领土以内为了行使主权、维护国家和人民的利益，都可以采取它认为必要的一切措施。最近埃及共和国纳赛尔总统把埃及领土内的苏彝士运河宣布收归国有，并声明保证尊重运河通航自由，这一措施乃是埃及共和国作为一个独立自主国家所应有的主权行为，无论在法律上和实际上都是合理的、正确的。因此，照道理来讲，对于埃及的这种主权活动是没有可以责难的理由和反驳的根据的。
    正是因为如此，从埃及宣布苏彝士运河国有以来，我们没有听到英法方面讲出什么道理，来证明它们的反对是有理由的和它们的主张是正确的。这些老牌的殖民主义者竟然宣布“冻结埃及资金”，甚至发布所谓“军事准备”命令等等，一味蛮横无理地来对待问题，这是吓不倒埃及人民、解决不了问题的，也是不能得到世界人民支持的。
    从历史上来说，在1854年法国人勒赛普请求埃及总督准许通过埃及领土开凿运河，沟通地中海和红海便利交通，以免远涉重洋绕行好望角遭受风浪的危险。埃及接受了这一建议，由埃、法两国合办，从1859年起开工到1869年完成。英国后来收买了埃及方面的大部分股票，加入了苏彝士运河公司的组织。1888年在君士坦丁堡召开的国际会议，决定开放苏彝士运河，准许各国通航，不论军舰、商船、交战国、中立国、平时、战时，并明白约定不得在运河内有交战行为。由此可见，苏彝士运河在国际关系上的唯一意义，只是国际交通上的便利。从1869年起埃及把自己领土内的运河为国际交通服务，现时已达八十七年之久，今后还要继续为国际通航服务，世界人民应当感谢埃及人民对于国际交通的这种贡献。
    现在，独立的埃及政府和人民为了维护国家的主权和利益，把苏彝士运河收归国有，保证通航自由。这是完全合情合理的。我们深信具有高度文化而对这一运河又有丰富经验的埃及人民，一定能够把它经营得更好，来为国际交通服务。
    持有苏彝士运河股份公司的股票的人，阻止不了埃及政府把运河收归国有。很明显的，股票的权利同国家的领土主权是不能相比的，全部的股票也不能影响国家的主权。何况埃及政府答应偿付股票持有者的股金，这种借口就更没有存在的根据了。殖民主义者如果硬要造成国际纠纷，不仅不能解决问题，而且它们必须担负全部引起国际关系紧张和干涉别国内政的责任。对于苏彝士运河问题，殖民主义者提出任何所谓“国际管制”、“国际法院”的解决办法，都是强词夺理的，不能成立的。只有依照互相尊重领土主权、互不干涉内政的原则，承认埃及收归国有的措施，来商谈公司清算的各种问题，才是正确的办法，也是唯一的办法；也只有这样，才能达到互益互利的目的。
    在过去的许多年代里，英法殖民主义者利用苏彝士运河直接或者是间接剥削埃及人民的利益，是难以估计的。现在的时代不同了，不是垄断海上霸权的那个时代了，也不是瓜分亚非国家土地和任意掠夺的时代了。殖民主义者长期奴役别国人民追求利润的黄金时代已经过去。亚非人民为了各自国家和民族的生存，决不容许殖民主义长期继续横行下去。从前殖民主义者所采取的所谓“99年”的长期压迫伎俩，现在是不行的，必须放弃的。殖民主义者可以休矣。
