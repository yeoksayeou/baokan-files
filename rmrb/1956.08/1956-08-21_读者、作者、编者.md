    Learn a Lesson from Factual Errors

    Recently, some factual errors have appeared in our newspaper's reports.

    The Member Management Division of the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote to point out that a statistic in the article "Should Not Advise Elderly and Sick Party Members to Withdraw from the Party" on the fourth page of the July 25th edition of this newspaper was inaccurate. That article stated: "The Member Management Division of the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has compiled statistics showing that approximately 30% of the party members advised to withdraw from the Party throughout the province in 1955 were elderly and sick party members." In fact, the Member Management Division did not have this statistic. After we inquired with Comrade Feng Jun, the author of the article, we learned that this figure was estimated based on typical materials from some localities, and also included some other party members who should not have been advised to withdraw from the Party; the author did not check with the Member Management Division after writing the manuscript, which led to the error.

    There are other examples of inaccurate reporting. For instance, in the news report titled "China Association for Promoting Democracy Actively Develops Its Organization" on the fourth page of this newspaper on August 4, it mentioned "Guo Minren, Deputy Director of the Fushun Municipal Education Bureau." According to a letter from the Cadre Management Division of the Fushun Municipal Committee's Culture and Education Department, Guo Minren is actually the Deputy Principal of Fushun High School, not the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau.

    Truthfulness is a fundamental principle that our newspaper must adhere to, and factual errors are not permissible. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to raise this issue again, hoping that everyone can learn from the lessons. Whether it is a reporter or another author, the materials used in the manuscript must be reliable and accurate, and cannot be based solely on "estimates"; moreover, it must be carefully verified with the relevant parties, and a careless attitude is unacceptable.

    The Commercial Press Has Not "Disappeared"

    On August 10th, page 8 of the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Ren Hui entitled "Doubts on the Theory of Fei Ming," which mentioned issues related to the Commercial Press.

    Since we moved the Editing and Reviewing Department to Beijing in March 1951, our main business has been publishing science and technology readings. We have published some translated textbooks and reference books for senior colleges and secondary technical schools; we have also published many general books. Since the implementation of the joint state-private ownership in May 1954, science and technology readings, reference books, ancient books and other publications originally published by our press have continued to be edited and published. In the last two years, we have published: ① 75 initial editions of general books, and 234 reprint editions; ② 6 reference books; ③ 40 ancient books; ④ 22 classical books on traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, in order to cooperate with the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we are preparing to organize new manuscripts appropriately, hoping to publish more valuable new works.

    Our work has not been done well enough, and we hope that all parties will give us more guidance; but Comrade Ren Hui's statement that this institution "has long disappeared" is not in accordance with the facts. Therefore, we have briefly described the work of our press in recent years as above, hoping that it can be published to avoid misunderstandings among readers.

    Hope to See Articles on Traditional Chinese Medicine

    Chang Jun from Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine wrote to say that he rarely sees academic articles on traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in newspapers, and the newspaper's coverage of traditional Chinese medicine work is also insufficient. He hopes that the editorial department will pay attention to this issue and let the medical heritage of the motherland shine in the newspapers.

    从报道失实中吸取教训
    近来，本报出现了一些报道失实的错误。
    中共江苏省委组织部党员管理处来信，指出七月二十五日本报第四版“不应该劝告年老多病的党员退党”一文中的一项统计数字是不确切的。这篇文章说：“中共江苏省委组织部党员管理处统计了一下，1955年全年全省被劝告退党的党员中约有30％是年老多病的党员。”其实，党员管理处并没有这项统计数字。经过我们向这篇文章的作者冯俊同志查询，原来这个数字是根据一些地方的典型材料估计的，而且其中还包括其他一些不应该劝告退党的党员；作者在写完此稿以后，也没有同党员管理处核对，以致造成错误。
    还有其它的一些报道失实的例子，如八月四日本报第四版以“中国民主促进会积极发展组织”为题的新闻报道中，提到“抚顺市教育局副局长郭民任”，其实，据抚顺市委文教部干部管理处来信说：郭民任是抚顺高中的副校长，并非教育局副局长。
    真实性是我们报纸必须遵守的基本原则，报道失实是不能容许的。因此我们认为有再一次提出这一问题的必要，希望大家能够吸取教训，不论是记者还是其它的作者，在稿件中采用的材料都必须是可靠的、准确的，决不能只凭“估计”；而且必须认真地同有关方面进行核对，不能采取轻率的态度。（编者）
    商务印书馆并未“不见”
    本月十日人民日报第八版，登载任晦同志的“废名论存疑”短文一篇，中间提到有关商务印书馆的问题。
    我馆自1951年3月将编审部迁移到北京，即以出版科学技术读物为主要业务，曾出版了一部分高级学校、中等技术学校的翻译教材和参考用书；一般用书也出版过不少。自1954年5月实行公私合营后，原由我馆出版的科学技术读物、工具书、古籍及其它书刊，仍继续编辑出版。以最近两年以来说，我馆出版了：①一般书初版七五种，重版二三四种；②工具书六种；③古籍四十种；④中医古典书二二种。最近为了配合百家争鸣的政策，准备适当地组织新稿，希望多出些有价值的新著作。
    我们的工作做得不够好，希望各方多予指教；但任晦同志说这一机构“早已不见了”，则与事实不符。为此，特将我馆几年来工作的情况简述如上，希望能予刊载，以免读者有所误会。

    希望看到有关中医的文章
    江苏省中医院常俊来信说，他在报纸上很少看到有关中医、中药方面的学术性文章，报纸对中医工作情况的报道也不够。他希望编辑部注意到这一问题，让祖国的医学遗产在报纸上发出它的光芒。
