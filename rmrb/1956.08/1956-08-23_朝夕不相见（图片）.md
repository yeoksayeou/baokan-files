    Not Seeing Each Other Morning and Evening
    The business hours of ××× Supply and Marketing Cooperative are not in sync with the production and rest times of the farmers. Although they work no short hours each day, farmers still cannot buy the goods they need before and after work.

    朝夕不相见
    ×××供销社的营业时间，和农民的生产、休息时间不协调。虽然他们每天工作的时间并不短，可是农民在上工前和下工后，仍然买不到需用的物品。
