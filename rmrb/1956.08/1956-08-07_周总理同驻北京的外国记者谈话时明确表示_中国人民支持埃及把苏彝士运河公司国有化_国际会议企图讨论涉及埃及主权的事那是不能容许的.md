Xinhua News Agency, 6th - A spokesperson for the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement on August 6th:

On August 4th, Premier Zhou Enlai, in a conversation with foreign journalists stationed in Beijing, clearly stated that the Chinese people fully support Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, and pointed out that the Egyptian government has guaranteed the freedom of navigation through the canal. If Britain and France still have doubts about this, they should seek a solution through consultation, and should not attempt to interfere by force. Any act of armed interference will certainly be opposed by the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, and is bound to fail.

Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks were so clear that they could not cause any misunderstanding. However, an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London on the 4th said that Premier Zhou Enlai "clearly expressed his support for the internationalization of the canal," which is without any basis. Not only that, when reporters asked him about his opinion on the international conference proposed by Britain, the United States, and France, Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that, judging from the communique of the three-nation meeting, this international conference was attempting to discuss matters involving Egyptian sovereignty, which is not permissible.

    周总理同驻北京的外国记者谈话时明确表示
    中国人民支持埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化
    国际会议企图讨论涉及埃及主权的事那是不能容许的
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人八月六日发表声明如下：
    八月四日，周恩来总理在同驻北京的外国记者们谈话时明确表示，中国人民完全支持埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化，并且指出埃及政府已经保证了运河的通航的自由。如果英法对此还有所怀疑的话，那就应该通过协商，求得解决，而不应该企图进行武力干涉。任何武力干涉的行动一定要遭到亚非人民和全世界人民的反对，是一定要失败的。
    周恩来总理的谈话是如此明确，不可能引起任何误解。但是法新社伦敦四日电竟然说周恩来总理“明白地表示赞成这条运河的国际化”，这是没有任何根据的。不仅如此，当记者们问起他对于英、美、法三国建议召开的国际会议的意见时，周恩来总理还曾指出，从三国会议的公报看，这个国际会议是要企图讨论涉及埃及主权的事，那是不能容许的。
