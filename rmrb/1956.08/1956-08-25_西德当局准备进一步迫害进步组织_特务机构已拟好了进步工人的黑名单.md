Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from Bonn, TASS: Following the banning of the German Communist Party, West German authorities are launching a campaign to persecute existing progressive groups of West German laborers.

    According to a report in "Die Welt," State Secretary Tedick of the West German Ministry for All-German Affairs expressed "concern" in a conversation about the so-called "activities of covert communist organizations." He included the League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom on the list of these organizations, and considered the "All-German Get-Together" held by German scientists and cultural workers from both parts of Germany, as well as the activities of unemployed committees, refugee committees, farmer committees, and other organizations of West German laborers, as "Communist activities."

    Tedick also regarded the "united action of the working class" as the main "Communist danger" and saw West German laboring people's organizations striving for peace as dangerous "Communist organizations."

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 23rd: According to a report in the West German Hamburg-based "Der Spiegel" weekly, the West German intelligence organization "Factory Security Intelligence Agency" has created a series of blacklists in an attempt to carry out large-scale persecution of progressive workers in factories and mines throughout West Germany. This intelligence organization is led by Christian Democratic Union parliamentarian and former Hitler General Staff Colonel, Fritz Behrendsen.

    特务机构已拟好了进步工人的黑名单
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社波恩二十二日讯：在德国共产党被禁止以后，西德当局正在展开迫害西德劳动人民现有的进步团体的运动。
    据“世界报”报道，西德全德事务部部务秘书特迪克在一次谈话中对所谓“隐蔽的共产党组织的活跃”表示了“担心”。他把德国人争取统一、和平和自由联盟列入这些组织的名单中，并且把德国两个部分的德国科学家和文化工作者举行的“全德联欢”以及失业者委员会、难民委员会、农民委员会和西德劳动者的其他组织的活动都看作是“共产党活动”。
    特迪克还把“工人阶级的统一行动”看作是主要的“共产党危险”，把西德劳动人民的争取和平的组织看作危险的“共产党组织”。
    据新华社柏林23日电　据西德汉堡出版的“明镜”周刊报道：西德的特务组织“工厂安全情报局”已经制造了一批黑名单，企图对西德各地厂矿的进步工人实行大规模的迫害。这个特务组织是由基督教民主联盟议员、前希特勒参谋总部的上校弗里茨·贝伦德森领导的。
