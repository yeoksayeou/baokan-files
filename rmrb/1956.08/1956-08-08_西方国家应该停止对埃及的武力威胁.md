Observer Commentary:

    Western countries are trying to replace the clear air over the Mediterranean with the smoke of gunpowder. In order to restore the "glory" of the 19th-century colonial empires, the warships, airplanes, and soldiers of Britain, France, and the United States are rushing towards the Mediterranean. These three countries, thrown into panic by Egypt's bold action to reclaim the Suez Canal, now want to resort to the outdated "gunboat policy" of dealing with colonial peoples, to force the Egyptian people to accept the so-called "international control" plan for the Suez Canal.

    The plan was put forward in a communique issued by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in London on August 2. They insisted that Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal was a so-called "threat" to the free navigation and security of the canal. On this pretext, they demanded that twenty-four countries selected by them hold a meeting in London on August 16 to "establish an operating arrangement under an international system." According to Reuters, officials from the three countries are drafting the details of this "international control" plan, in order to bring it to the conference table of the proposed meeting and force other countries to sign and approve it. It is said that the planned "international control" organization will include an international management bureau, under which there will be an expert management committee, which will be responsible for the daily management of the canal and ensure the free passage of the canal.

    When the United Kingdom, France, and the United States were drafting the so-called "international control" plan for the Suez Canal, they did not take Egypt's sovereignty into account at all. The Suez Canal is a canal dug by the Egyptian people on Egyptian territory, and it is part of Egyptian territory. The Egyptian government has every right to exercise its sovereignty over this part of its territory, including the management of the Suez Canal. This is a matter of course. When the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, it had already guaranteed compensation to the holders of canal shares and guaranteed the freedom of navigation of the canal. Facts have also proved that the Suez Canal has been unobstructed so far. Moreover, the Egyptian government has announced that it will quickly take measures to improve the canal's navigation equipment, which the old Suez Canal Company under foreign control has not done for a long time.

    Western countries are now using the non-existent so-called freedom of navigation issue as an excuse to attempt to implement "international control" over the canal, seize Egypt's management rights over the canal, and create a state within a state in Egypt. This is clearly an attempt to seriously infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty. This "international control" plan not only shows that Western countries are trying to revive the old Suez Canal Company, which they directly controlled, but also shows that they are trying to occupy the Suez Canal indefinitely and permanently occupy the canal area. In this case, it is absurd for Western countries to accuse Egypt of not keeping its international commitments, saying that Egypt's guarantee of freedom of navigation of the canal is unreliable.

    Western countries now say that they want to separate the issue of canal nationalization from the issue of ensuring canal navigation. They are trying to make people believe that their "international control" approach is not to deal with Egypt's nationalization of the canal, but seems to be upright for the benefit of international shipping. However, perhaps no one has stated more bluntly what Western countries want to achieve through the so-called "international control" than French Foreign Minister Pineau. In a broadcast after the London talks, he said in an extremely provocative manner that if Egyptian President Nasser accepted the decision after the proposed meeting made a decision on the Suez Canal issue in accordance with the intentions of Western countries, "he would have to completely abandon his nationalization," and if he refused, Western countries would "force him to accept" the decision.

    However, Mr. Pineau's "rhetoric," which is not quite commensurate with France's strength, is a little too early. Today is no longer the 19th century, and the days when the use of force and intervention could solve problems are long gone. If Britain and France have used a lot of force and have not been able to suppress the struggle of the people of Malaya, Kenya, and Algeria for independence, they will never be able to use force to subdue the independent Egyptian people. Moreover, the just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard independence and sovereignty is by no means isolated. Behind the Egyptian people stand hundreds of millions of Asian and African people who oppose colonialism. If the colonialists insist on setting fire in Egypt, then they will surely be consumed by their own fire.

    The Suez Canal has undertaken the glorious task of communicating Eastern and Western cultures and economies in the past, but it has also been used by colonialists as a shortcut for conquest and plunder. Today, the canal has returned to the hands of the Egyptian people, and Egypt has guaranteed that the canal will better serve the interests of all mankind in the future. If Western countries still have doubts about Egypt's guarantees, they should seek a solution through equal negotiations and consultations on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty. The use of force and intervention will not solve the problem.

    The current situation requires the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to adopt a calm and realistic attitude. Sadness and emotional impulses arising from seeing the death of colonialism are of no avail. Western countries now only have to put away their swords and guns and sincerely negotiate with Egypt. Otherwise, they will not only fail to safeguard their own interests, but will also bear the serious responsibility of disrupting peace in the Middle East and the world.

### 西方国家应该停止对埃及的武力威胁

    西方国家应该停止对埃及的武力威胁
    西方国家正在想用硝烟来代替地中海上的明净的空气。为了恢复十九世纪殖民帝国的“光荣”，英国、法国和美国的军舰、飞机和士兵都在匆匆忙忙地向着地中海奔去。被埃及收回苏彝士运河的果敢行动弄得惊慌失措的这三个国家，现在想乞灵于早已过了时的对付殖民地人民的“炮舰政策”，来迫使埃及人民接受所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划。
    英、法、美三国八月二日在伦敦发表的公报里提出了这个计划。它们硬说埃及收回苏彝士运河是对于运河的自由航行和安全的一种所谓“威胁”。凭着这个借口，它们要求经过它们挑选的二十四个国家在八月十六日在伦敦举行会议，来“建立在国际制度下的一种经营安排”。据路透社报道，三国官员正在拟订这个“国际管制”计划的细节，以便拿到建议举行的会议桌上来迫使其他国家签字画押。据说，计划中的“国际管制”机构将包括一个国际管理局，下辖一个专家管理委员会，这个委员会将负责运河的日常管理事务，以及保证运河的自由通航。
    英、法、美三国在拟订所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划的时候，根本就没有把埃及的主权放在眼里。苏彝士运河是在埃及领土上由埃及人民开掘出来的一条运河，它是埃及领土的一部分。埃及政府有一切权利在这部分领土上行使它的主权，包括管理苏彝士运河在内。这是天经地义的事情。埃及政府在宣布苏彝士运河国有化的时候，已经保证对运河股票的持有人给予补偿，并且保证运河的航行自由。事实也已经证明，苏彝士运河至今畅通无阻。而且埃及政府也宣布将要迅速进行改善运河航行设备的措施，而这些是外国控制下的旧苏彝士运河公司长期以来所没有做的。
    西方国家现在以并不存在的所谓航行自由问题为借口，企图对运河实行“国际管制”，夺取埃及对运河的管理权，在埃及制造一个国中之国，这显然是想严重地侵犯埃及的主权。这个“国际管制”的计划不但说明西方国家企图复活那个由它们直接控制的旧日的苏彝士运河公司，而且说明它们企图无限期地占领苏彝士运河，把运河地区永远据为己有。在这种情况下，西方国家还来指责埃及不守国际信义，说什么埃及对运河航行自由的保证不可靠，实在是荒谬之至。
    西方国家现在说，它们要把运河国有化的问题和保证运河通航的问题分开来。它们企图使人相信，它们搞的“国际管制”这一套，并不是为了对付埃及把运河收归国有，而似乎是光明正大的为了国际航运的利益。可是，西方国家想通过所谓“国际管制”来达到什么目的，大概没有比法国外交部长比诺说得更露骨的了。他在伦敦会谈结束以后在一次广播中用极端挑衅的态度说，在建议举行的会议就苏彝士运河问题按照西方国家的意图作出决定以后，埃及总统纳赛尔如果接受这个决定，“他就不得不完全放弃他的国有化”，如果他拒绝，西方国家就将“迫使他接受”这个决定。
    可是，比诺先生这种同法国的力量并不十分相称的“豪言壮语”，未免说得太早了一点。今天已经不是十九世纪，用武力威胁和干涉可以解决问题的日子早已过去了。如果英国和法国动用了大量的兵力，都还没有能够镇压得了马来亚、怯尼亚和阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，它们就更休想能够用武力使独立了的埃及人民屈服。而且，埃及人民进行的维护独立和主权的正义斗争，决不是孤立的，在埃及人民后面站着数以亿计的亚洲和非洲的反对殖民主义的人民。如果殖民主义者硬要在埃及放火，那么它们就一定将玩火自焚。
    苏彝士运河在过去承担了沟通东西文化和经济的光荣任务，但是它也曾被殖民主义者利用来作为进行征服和掠夺的捷径。今天运河回到了埃及人民手里，埃及已经保证使运河今后能更好地为全体人类的利益服务。如果西方国家对埃及的保证还有所怀疑的话，就应该在尊重埃及主权的基础上，通过平等的谈判协商来求得解决。使用武力威胁和干涉是解决不了问题的。
    目前的局势要求英、法、美三国采取冷静的现实的态度。由于眼看到殖民主义的死亡而产生的悲伤和感情冲动，都是于事无补的。西方国家现在只有收起刀枪，同埃及诚意协商。否则的话，它们不但不能维护自己的利益，而且还将担负破坏中东和世界和平的严重责任。
