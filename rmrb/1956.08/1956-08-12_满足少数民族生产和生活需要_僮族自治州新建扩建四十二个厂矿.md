Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 10th. To further meet the production and living needs of the minority people residing here, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture is currently constructing and expanding forty-two state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and mines.

Among these projects, seven newly built factories will be equipped with modern equipment; and some factories that were originally small in scale and equipped with simple equipment will also use machines to replace manual production after expansion, greatly increasing production volume.

In the sugarcane production area, three sugar refineries with a daily crushing capacity of 250 tons, located in Hengxian, Lingli, and Mingyang, have been newly established. One of these sugar refineries was completed at the end of July. This completed sugar refinery will be able to start crushing when the new sugarcane comes on the market. The main buildings of the frozen meat processing plant and flour mill located in the suburbs of Nanning are under intense construction. Among them, the frozen meat processing plant will be built into nine semi-automatic workshops, and a cold storage with a capacity of 6,500 tons will be built. The Sanjiang Phosphate Mine, built with the investment and assistance of the higher-level government for the Zhuang people, is the first phosphate mine in Guangxi Province. This factory will soon be put into production, and it is estimated that it can produce about 10,000 tons of phosphate rock powder annually. At the Helan Mining Area of the Heshan Coal Mine, the largest coal mining area in the autonomous prefecture, coal miners are using electric drills to make holes. The newly installed scraper conveyors, winches, and belt conveyors have replaced manual coal transportation. Due to continuous expansion, the coal output of this mining area this year can be increased by two times compared with 1954.

In addition, the expansion projects also include farm tool factories in ten counties and some small chemical plants, printing factories, etc. The expanded Baise Agricultural Machinery Factory can produce 80,000 walking plows annually according to its equipment capacity, supporting agricultural production.

The development of electrical equipment has further changed the appearance of the cities in the autonomous prefecture. The seven newly built and expanded small thermal power plants and two hydropower stations, in addition to supplying electricity to urban industries, government agencies, schools, can also supply electricity for lighting to the vast number of people. Eighteen county towns in the autonomous prefecture now have power plants. Including the newly built and expanded power plants this year, most county towns in the prefecture will have electric lights.

    满足少数民族生产和生活需要
    僮族自治州新建扩建四十二个厂矿
    新华社南宁10日电　桂西僮族自治州正在动工新建和扩建四十二个国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿，以便进一步满足居住在这里的少数民族人民生产和生活的需要。
    在这些工程中，有七个新建工厂将要安装现代化的设备；另有一些工厂原来规模很小，设备简陋，经过扩建以后，也将用机器代替手工生产，大大提高生产量。
    在甘蔗产区新出现的日榨二百五十吨的横县、伶俐、明阳等三个糖厂，其中的一个已经在七月底建成。这个建成的糖厂等到新蔗上市就可以开榨。设在南宁市郊区的冻肉加工厂和面粉厂的主厂房工程，正在紧张地进行施工。其中，冻肉加工厂将建成九个半自动化车间，还设有一座可容六千五百吨的冻库。由上级政府投资帮助僮族人民兴建的三江磷矿，是广西省第一座磷矿厂。这个厂不久将可投入生产，预计每年能生产一万吨左右的磷粉。自治州现在最大的煤矿区——合山煤矿里兰矿场，采煤工人正在使用电钻打眼，新安装的刮板运输机、绞车、皮带运输机代替了人工运煤。这个矿场由于不断进行扩建，今年煤产量可比1954年提高两倍。
    此外，在扩建工程中还有十个县的农具厂和一些小型的化工厂、印刷厂等。扩建后的百色农械厂，按其设备能力可以年产八万部步犁，支援农业生产。
    电力设备的发展，进一步改变了自治州城市的面貌。新建和扩建的七个小型火力发电厂和两个水力发电站，除供应城镇工业、机关学校用电外，还可供应广大人民照明。自治州现在已经有十八个县城有了电厂。加上今年新建和扩建的电厂在内，全州大部分县城都将有电灯。
