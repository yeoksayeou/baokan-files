Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th - In the first half of this year, Wuhan has provided employment for over 12,100 unemployed individuals. They have all been placed in various basic construction sites, factories, and enterprises in Wuhan, taking on production or administrative work. Among them, over 7,000 young people who did not continue their education have been assigned to various basic construction sites and factories to learn production techniques. In addition, over 4,500 strong laborers, skilled workers, and young people have obtained fixed production or work positions.

According to the person in charge of the Wuhan Labor Bureau, with the development of production and construction, the government has placed a large number of unemployed people in recent years. Now, the number of strong laborers, young people, and intellectuals with employment qualifications in Wuhan can no longer meet the needs of Wuhan's industrial construction. The government will continue to arrange employment for other unemployed personnel in the second half of this year.

    武汉市又有一万多人就业
    新华社武汉12日电　武汉市上半年已有一万二千一百多名失业无业的人就业。他们都被安置在武汉市各基本建设工地、工厂和企业里担任生产或机关工作。其中有七千多名没有升学的青年，被分配到各基本建设工地和工厂去学习生产技术。另外四千五百多名壮工、技术工人、青年等得到了固定的生产或工作岗位。
    据武汉市劳动局负责人谈，随着生产建设的发展，几年来政府安置了大批失业、无业者，现在武汉市有就业条件的壮工、青年和知识分子已经不能满足武汉工业建设的需要。政府在今年下半年对其他尚未就业的人员将继续进行安置。
