Many Side Businesses, But Little Benefit?
    ——Several Problems in the Diversified Operations of Matang Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Investigation Team of the Rural Work Department of the Qianyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The Matang Agricultural Production Cooperative (advanced cooperative) in Huitong County, Hunan Province, has a total of 209 households and 1,365 mu of paddy fields. Located near mountains and water, farmers have a tradition of engaging in side businesses, and the pottery and bamboo hats produced are sold to many areas within the province. According to a typical survey of the side-business income of 12 cooperative members in 1954 (after joining the cooperative in 1955 and 1956, some side businesses have been converted to collective operation), side-business income accounted for 56.1% of the total income.

Last year, this cooperative was a primary cooperative with 79 households, and the total income for the year was 20,369 yuan, of which side-business income accounted for 22.1%. This year, after vigorously developing diversified operations, the number and quantity of collectively operated side-business production projects have increased compared to last year. Currently, 13 side-business production projects have been launched, including pig raising, lime burning, bamboo hat weaving, pottery making, duck raising, duckling hatching, and sewing. As of July 15, side-business income had reached 9,280 yuan, and it is estimated that another 8,000 to 9,000 yuan can be earned by the end of the year. After the development of side businesses, not only did a large part of agricultural and sideline products have the funds needed for expanded reproduction, and some cooperative members had pocket money, but it also solved the problem of work attendance for more than 20 households with a lack of labor and weak labor that were expected to reduce income; at the same time, some experience in managing side-business production was accumulated.

The side-business production of this cooperative can be roughly divided into the following five types:

    1. Small cost, high profit, fast turnover: Lime burning, fish farming, fishing, rice milling, oil pressing, sewing, and odd jobs. For example, 1.44 million jin of lime can be burned in six months, requiring more than 4,900 workdays, and the profit rate is 82%.

    2. Small cost, high profit, slow turnover: Pottery making, duck raising. For example, more than 11,000 pottery tubes can be burned in eight months, requiring 373 workdays, with a profit of 70.4%.

    3. Small cost, small profit, fast turnover: Bamboo hat weaving, straw sandal making. For example, more than 500 pairs of straw sandals can be made in five months with more than 50 workdays, with a profit of 89.4%.

    4. Large cost, high profit, slow turnover: Duckling hatching. More than 11,000 ducklings can be hatched in three months with 144 workdays, with a profit of 30.7%.

    5. Large cost, small profit, slow turnover: Pig raising. Ninety-nine pigs can be raised in nine months, requiring 791 workdays, with a profit of 8.5%.

From the above materials, it can be seen that most side-business projects have small costs, high profits, and development prospects. However, due to a lack of thorough consideration of the funds, costs, and other issues of side businesses in advance, improper arrangements for labor, a lack of collective management experience, and deviations in the understanding of the combination of the collective interests of the cooperative and the personal interests of cooperative members, there are currently the following problems:

    (1) After emphasizing the unified management of side businesses, the leadership of cooperative members' family side-business production is neglected, and cooperative members' family side-business production is declining year by year.

The output value of side-business production uniformly managed by the cooperative has increased compared to last year. Compared with the same period last year, the output value of major side businesses such as lime, pottery, pig raising, duck raising, and bamboo hat weaving has increased by about 20% in the whole cooperative, but the family side-business production of cooperative members is declining year by year. According to a typical survey of 23 cooperative members, the total value of family side businesses for the whole year in 1954 (mutual aid group) was more than 6,160 yuan, which dropped to more than 5,580 yuan in 1955 (primary cooperative), and further dropped to more than 4,550 yuan in 1956 (advanced cooperative). 1955 decreased by 9.5% compared to 1954, and 1956 decreased by 18.5% compared to 1955. Among them, the largest decrease was in family breeding industry. The total value of family breeding industry for 209 households in the whole cooperative last year was 9,111 yuan, which dropped to 6,724 yuan this year, a decrease of 26%; among them, the number of pigs raised decreased by 70.1%. Other family handicrafts have also decreased, and going out to work as a craftsman is not as good as in previous years, and cooperative members going out to do odd jobs has been completely stopped. If the total value of collectively operated side businesses and cooperative members' family side businesses is added together, it is almost not much more than last year.

What is the reason?

    1. No attention was paid to properly arranging the time for cooperative members' family side-business production. The agricultural production plan is too high, and the labor required has greatly increased compared to the past, which is a practical problem. However, if the labor is arranged properly, cooperative members still have time to engage in family side-business production. This year, the work attendance situation of the whole cooperative is: from December of last winter to mid-July of this year, in 225 days, a total of 34,992 workdays were done. The whole cooperative has 475 full and semi-laborers, equivalent to 302 standard laborers. Calculated on the basis of each standard laborer doing 0.7 work units per day, more than 47,000 workdays can be done in 225 days. According to this calculation, the number of days cooperative members attend work accounts for about 73.3% of the total number of days. It is possible to mobilize and organize cooperative members to do a good job in family side-business production during the time they are not working. However, the cooperative work team and cooperative cadres did not pay enough attention to this, overemphasized collective work attendance, and rarely arranged cooperative members' family labor.

    2. Believing in the estimated value of workdays, it is generally felt that engaging in family side-business production is not worthwhile. This spring, according to an unrealistic production plan, the remuneration for each workday was 2.5 yuan. After a preliminary revision of the production plan in early July, it was changed to 1.4 yuan. Cooperative members generally feel that: doing one or two work units can get 40 or 50 cents, and the income from sporadic family side-business labor is not large, so they are unwilling to do it.

    3. Lack of necessary support for family side businesses. This is reflected in the following specific problems:

    First, too little private land and a lack of feed. The whole cooperative only distributed more than 37 mu of private land to cooperative members, with an average of only 4 li per person (according to the advanced cooperative model charter, private land can account for 5% of the average land per person, and the cooperative has an average of 1.5 mu of land per person, so each person can have an average of 7.5 li of private land). The habit of cooperative members planting taro (which can be stored until June or July of the following year) and radishes in the fields as feed was stopped, causing serious difficulties in pig feed.

    Second, lack of funds. Local farmers are accustomed to buying piglets in the spring. The source of funds for buying pigs in the spring is mainly the side-business income in the winter. This year, all the side-business income was turned over to the cooperative, and most of it was used as investment in agriculture and collective side businesses. No pre-distribution was carried out in the spring, and some cooperative members had no money to buy piglets.

    Third, the selling price of live pigs is too low. The local purchase price of live pigs is 26.4 yuan per 100 jin. However, the price of piglets is very high this year. Buying a piglet (weighing about 12 jin, 80 cents per jin) costs about 10 yuan. Raising it to 100 jin only yields a profit of about 16 yuan. After calculating the cost of feed, firewood, and labor, each pig will lose several yuan.

    (2) Side-business funds are not used reasonably.

The cooperative has a lot of side-business income, with an average of 46 yuan per household, but the cooperative's funds are still not ample, and cooperative members still feel a lack of pocket money. What is the reason for this? The main reason is that the use of funds is improper.

First of all, too much side-business infrastructure construction was carried out too early. This year, in order to raise pigs collectively, a large pigsty with 30 connected rooms was built, costing a total of more than 1,100 yuan. According to cooperative members, if the pigsty was not built and the original equipment was used for decentralized breeding, it would be possible. In order to engage in transportation, three horses and two carts were purchased, costing more than 810 yuan. Due to poor planning, this plan cannot be carried out now, and the carts are idle (one horse has died). In addition, a sewing machine worth more than 150 yuan was purchased. The above cost a total of 2,100 yuan. These funds could have been used less or not used at all in the current situation.

Secondly, the pre-distribution system is unreasonable. Since last winter, except for one pre-distribution after the spring harvest, the rest have been done by means of sporadic advances. Some cooperative members who are really active in work attendance get very few advances, while those who are not active in work attendance get more; individual cooperative cadres also use their powers to get a large number of advances. This not only affects the enthusiasm of cooperative members, but also relatively increases the atmosphere of cooperative members clamoring for lack of pocket money.

Again, the collective breeding industry run this year is more extensive, with an investment of more than 3,800 yuan, and the turnover is very slow. Pig raising will not yield income until the end of the year, and duckling hatching and duckling raising have not yet yielded income; the cooperative does not have much public accumulation and cannot take out a sum of side-business advance funds. Therefore, a large part of the side-business income is invested in production for a long time as working capital, which cannot meet the minimum needs of cooperative members for daily expenses.

    (3) There are also some problems in the management of side-business production.

    1. The boundary between collective management and decentralized management has not been clearly drawn. Among the 13 side-business production items under unified management, some items are not suitable for unified management in the current situation. The first is collective pig raising. The cooperative lacks equipment and collective pig raising experience, and planned to raise 400 pigs at once (actually only 104 were raised). Due to lack of feed and poor care, in addition to the death of five pigs, the others are also weak and thin. The second is some small family handicrafts, such as straw sandal making, fishing, and sewing, which do not need to be "unified." Only 528 pairs of straw sandals have been turned over to the cooperative, and it is reported that the quality is not good, and the good ones are still sold privately. Only nine yuan has been turned over to the cooperative from fishing. Although sewing has yielded 96 yuan, only 32 yuan has been turned over. These side-business incomes are limited, but they have caused many management problems.

    2. Side-business work quota issues: Generally, attention has been paid to balancing with agricultural work quotas, and technical and social parity issues have also been taken into account, but there are still some problems. For example, there are no classified quotas for pig raising (sows, piglets, feeder pigs, etc.); the pottery firing quota is somewhat loose; and the conversion of cash to workdays for some side businesses is not reasonable enough, all of which are worth further research and improvement.

    (4) There is a tendency to overemphasize side-business production and neglect forestry, cash crops, and high-yield crop production.

Diversified operations include not only side-business production, but also forestry and cash crops. Cooperative office cadres and cooperative cadres have deviations in their understanding of this issue, believing that developing diversified operations means engaging in side businesses. This year, they have focused more on rice production and side-business production, and somewhat relaxed their leadership over forestry, cash crops, and high-yield crop production. The cooperative has a large area of ​​tea-oil trees, with more than 1,500 mu of tea-oil forest, producing more than 33,400 jin of oil annually. This year, due to being busy with rice and side-business production, and insufficient attention from the leadership, it has not yet been reclaimed. According to discussions with old farmers, it is expected that production will decrease by 30% next year. According to this calculation, more than 4,400 yuan will be lost next year. Taro is a high-yield crop favored by local farmers (producing more than 3,000 jin per mu), and its economic value is also very high (the output value per mu can reach more than 190 yuan). This year, it has been greatly reduced. In addition to the cooperative planting more than 4 mu, cooperative members are not allowed to plant it, which will reduce income by more than 1,400 yuan (excluding the income from converting to rice). This is related to the large-scale planting of double-cropping rice this year. This year, double-cropping rice was expanded to more than 500 mu (accounting for 39% of the total paddy field area), increasing the labor force by more than 3,000. Since double-cropping rice has to seize the season and race against time, the cultivation and management of other crops and the reclamation of tea-oil forests will naturally be affected. In areas suitable for large-scale development of multiple planting and side-business production, whether it is completely appropriate to promote double-cropping rice excessively is a question worth discussing.

    经营副业不少，为什么实惠不多？
    ——麻塘农业生产合作社开展多种经营中的几个问题
    中共黔阳地委农村工作部调查组
    湖南省会同县麻塘农业生产合作社（高级社）共二百零九户，有稻田一千三百六十五亩。靠山近水，农民历年有经营副业的习惯，所产陶器、斗笠远销省内不少地区。根据十二户社员1954年家庭副业收入典型调查（1955、1956年入社以后，部分副业已转为集体经营），副业收入占总收入的56.1％。
    去年这个社是七十九户的初级社，全年总收入二万零三百六十九元，其中副业收入占22.1％。今年大力开展多种经营以后，集体经营的副业生产项目和数量，较去年又有增加。目前已经开展起来的副业生产项目有养猪、烧石灰、织斗笠、烧陶器、养鸭、孵小鸭、缝纫等十三项。截至7月15日止，副业收入已达九千二百八十元，预计到年底还能收入八、九千元。副业开展以后，不仅一大部分农副业有了扩大再生产所需要的资金，一部分社员有了零用钱，还解决了二十多户预计会减少收入的缺乏劳动力和劳动力不强的社员的出工问题；同时积累了一些管理副业生产的经验。
    这个社的副业生产，大体可分如下五个类型：
    1、成本小、获利大、周转快：有烧石灰、养鱼、打鱼、碾米、榨油、缝纫、作零工等。例如六个月可烧石灰一百四十四万斤，需要劳动日四千九百多个，利润率是82％。
    2、成本小、获利大、周转慢：有烧陶器、养鸭。例如八个月烧陶器一万一千多筒，需要劳动日三百七十三个，利润70.4％。
    3、成本小、获利小、周转快：织斗笠、打草鞋。例如五个月内用五十多个劳动日可打草鞋五百多双，利润89.4％。
    4、成本大、获利大、周转慢：孵小鸭。三个月内用一百四十四个劳动日，孵小鸭一万一千多只，利润30.7％。
    5、成本大、获利小、周转慢：养猪。九个月养猪九十九头，需要劳动日七百九十一个，利润8.5％。
    从上面的材料可以看出，多数副业项目是成本小、获利大，有发展前途的。但由于事先对副业的资金、成本等问题缺乏周密考虑，劳动力的安排不妥，缺乏集体经营管理经验，加上对于社的集体利益与社员个人利益的结合问题理解上有偏差，目前还有以下几个问题：
    （一）强调副业统一经营后，忽视对社员家庭副业生产的领导，社员家庭副业生产逐年下降。
    由社统一经营的副业生产的产值比去年有所增加，与去年同一时期比较，全社石灰、陶器、养猪、养鸭、织斗笠等主要副业的产值约增加20％左右，但社员的家庭副业生产却在逐年下降。根据二十三户社员的典型调查，1954年（互助组）全年的家庭副业总值为六千一百六十多元，1955年（初级社）降为五千五百八十多元，1956年（高级社）又降为四千五百五十多元。1955年较1954年减少9.5％，1956年又较1955年减少18.5％。其中减少最多的是家庭饲养业。全社二百零九户，去年家庭饲养业的产值是九千一百十一元，今年降为六千七百二十四元，减少26％；其中养猪头数减少了70.1％。其他家庭手工业也有减少，外出作手艺也不如往年，社员个人出外作零工已完全停止。如果把集体经营的副业和社员家庭副业的总值相加，同去年比较，几乎没有多大增加。
    原因何在？
    1、没有注意适当安排社员的家庭副业生产时间。农业生产计划偏高，需工较过去大大增加，这是个实际问题。但如果劳力安排得恰当，社员还是有时间从事家庭副业生产的。今年全社的出工情况是：从去冬12月至今年7月中旬二百二十五天中，共作三万四千九百九十二个劳动日。全社有男女全半劳动力四百七十五个，折标准劳动力三百零二个，以每天每个标准劳动力做七分工计算，二百二十五天可作四万七千多个劳动日。以此计算，社员的出勤天数约占总天数73.3％。在不出工的时间内，动员和组织社员搞好家庭副业生产是可能的。但办社工作组和社干部对这注意不够，过分强调集体出工，很少安排社员的家庭劳动。
    2、迷信预计的劳动日价值，普遍感到搞家庭副业生产划不来。今年春天，按照不切合实际的生产计划，每个劳动日报酬是二元五角，7月初经过初步修订生产计划之后，改为一元四角。社员普遍感到：做一、两分工就可得到四、五角钱，零星的家庭副业劳动收入不大，就不愿意做了。
    3、对家庭副业缺乏必要的支持。表现在以下几个具体问题上：
    第一、自用地过少，缺乏饲料。全社仅分给社员自用地三十七亩多，每人平均仅四厘（按高级社示范章程规定，自用地可占每人平均土地的5％，该社每人平均土地一亩半，每人平均可有自用地七厘五）。社员历年在田里种芋头（可贮藏到次年六、七月）和萝卜作饲料的习惯停止了，造成了养猪饲料方面的严重困难。
    第二、缺乏资金。当地农民习惯，一般是春季买进小猪。春季买猪资金的来源主要是冬季的副业收入。今年副业收入全部交给社里，交给社里之后又以大部分作为农业和集体副业投资，春天没有进行预分，有些社员无钱买小猪。
    第三、毛猪售价偏低。当地收购毛猪价格每百斤二十六元四角。但今年小猪价格很高，买进一头小猪（十二斤左右重，每斤八角），要十元左右。养到一百斤，获利仅十六元左右。把饲料、柴火、人工账一算，每头要亏本好几元。
    （二）副业资金使用不够合理。
    这个社的副业收入不少，每户平均可分四十六元，但社里资金仍不宽裕，社员仍感到缺乏零用钱，社员从副业收入中获得的实惠不多。这是什么原因呢？主要是资金的运用不得当。
    首先是过早过多地搞了副业基本建设。今年为了集体养猪，修了一个三十间相连的大猪栏，共花去人民币一千一百多元。据社员反映，如果不修猪栏，利用原有设备，分散饲养是可以的。为了搞运输，买了三匹马，两个板车，用去人民币八百一十多元，由于计划不周，现在这项计划还不能开展，马车都闲置起来（马已死了一匹）。此外，还买进了一部价值一百五十多元的缝纫机。以上共花去人民币二千一百元。这些资金，在今年的情况下是可以少用或不用的。
    其次是预分制度不合理。自去冬以来，除春收作物收获后预分过一次外，其余都是采取零星借支的办法。真正出工积极的社员有的借支得很少，出工不积极的反而借得多；个别社干部也利用职权大量借支。这不仅影响了社员劳动积极性，也相对地增加了社员喊缺零钱的空气。
    再次，今年集体经营的饲养业搞得较多，投入资金达三千八百多元，周转很慢。养猪要到年底才能收益，孵小鸭、养小鸭至今还没有收益；社里公共积累不多，不能拿出一笔副业的垫付资金。因此，一大部分副业收入长期投入生产中作资金周转，不能满足社员日常用钱的最低需要。
    （三）副业生产管理上也有一些问题。
    1、没有划清集体经营和分散经营的界限。统一经营的十三项副业生产中，在目前情况下，有几项是不宜统一经营的。第一是集体养猪，这个社既缺乏设备，又没有集体养猪经验，一下就计划养猪四百头（实际上只养了一百零四头），由于缺乏饲料和照料不好，除死去五头外，别的也都瘦弱不堪。第二是几项小型的家庭手工业，如打草鞋、打鱼、缝纫之类，也不必一律“统”起来。草鞋现在只向社交纳五百二十八双，据反映质量不好，好的仍由私人卖掉了。打鱼至今只向社交钱九元。缝衣服虽收入九十六元，也只交纳三十二元。这些副业收入有限，却造成了管理上的许多麻烦。
    2、副业工作定额问题：一般都注意了同农业工作定额平衡，也照顾了技术和社会比价等问题，但目前仍存在一些问题，如养猪没有分类定额（母猪、小猪、架子猪等）；烧陶器定额有些偏松；部分副业交现金折算劳动日不够合理等等，都值得进一步研究改进。
    （四）有偏重副业生产忽视林业、经济作物和高产作物生产的偏向。
    多种经营内容不仅包括副业生产，还包括林业、经济作物。办社干部和社干部对这个问题在理解上是有偏差的，认为开展多种经营就是搞副业，今年对稻谷生产和副业生产抓得比较紧，对林业、经济作物和高产作物的生产领导却有些放松。这个社油茶林的面积很大，有油茶林一千五百多亩，年产油三万三千四百多斤，今年由于忙于稻谷和副业生产，加以领导重视不够，至今尚未垦复。据老农座谈，预计明年要减产30％。按这推算，明年将损失四千四百多元。芋头是当地农民喜爱的高产作物（每亩可产三千多斤），经济价值也很高（每亩产值可达人民币一百九十多元），今年大大减少，除社里种植四亩多外，不准社员种植，这一项将减少收入一千四百多元（除去改种稻谷的收入）。这同今年大量播种双季稻有一定关系。今年双季稻一下扩大到五百多亩（占稻田总面积39％），增加用工三千多个。由于双季稻要抢季节、赶工夫，其他作物的栽培管理和油茶林垦复自然要受到一定影响。在适宜于大量开展多种种植和副业生产的地区，过多地推广双季稻是不是完全适宜，是一个值得商榷的问题。　（1956年7月30日）
