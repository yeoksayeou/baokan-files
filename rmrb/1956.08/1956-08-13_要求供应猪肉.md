    Demand for Pork Supply
    Xiang Cun
    Many farmers in Yucheng County, Shandong Province, have not tasted pork for more than a year. Wu Yanzhang, a member of the Fuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Shiliwang District, and his family have not eaten pork once in fourteen months. During the Spring Festival, because they couldn't buy pork, they had to buy some beef to celebrate the New Year.
    Because the pork supply is too small, pork is not available in any of the restaurants and canteens at Yucheng Station, which has caused dissatisfaction among passing passengers. Some passengers said angrily: Why can pork be eaten in Pingyuan and other neighboring counties, but not here? Because the pork supply here is too small, the abnormal pork diversion phenomenon has also occurred. For example, the Yucheng County People's Committee Canteen has sent people by bicycle several times to Jinan City, nearly a hundred miles away, to buy pork. Some cadres also take the opportunity to bring back a few pounds of pork to taste when they go out to meetings.
    Why can't people in Yucheng County eat pork? Of course, the most fundamental reason is that too few pigs are raised. According to statistics, Yucheng County only raised more than 12,000 pigs this year, 20,000 fewer than in 1954. However, the current problem is the neglect of supplying a certain amount of pork locally. The state-owned food company plans to purchase 6,300 live pigs in Yucheng County this year. The county raises a total of more than 12,000 pigs. In addition to 4,000 sows and a considerable number of piglets, it is necessary to make great efforts to complete this purchase plan. Therefore, all live pigs over forty catties have been pre-ordered, so there is little or no pork left for the county and farmers to eat themselves.
    If farmers cannot eat pork, their interest in raising pigs will be even smaller. The fact that piglets in Xindian District, Yucheng County, are constantly flowing to neighboring counties is clear evidence. According to statistics, more than 600 piglets flowed out of Xindian District in April and May, and nearly 50 more flowed to neighboring counties after the wheat harvest. The reason why the number of pigs raised by farmers has not quickly reached the 1954 level is related to the poor pork supply.

    要求供应猪肉
    向村
    山东省禹城县很多农民已一年多没有尝到猪肉了。十里望区复兴农业社社员吴延章全家已经有十四个月没吃过一次猪肉。过春节的时候，因为买不到猪肉，只好买点牛肉，算是过了年。
    因为猪肉供应得太少，在禹城车站上的所有饭铺和食堂里也都吃不到猪肉，引起了过路旅客的不满。有的旅客气愤地说：为什么在平原等邻县可以吃到猪肉，这里却没有？因为这里的猪肉供应太少，不正常的猪肉倒流现象也就发生了。如禹城县人民委员会食堂曾几次派人骑了自行车，到距离近百里地的济南市去买猪肉。有的机关干部也趁外出开会的机会，捎几斤猪肉回来尝尝。
    为什么在禹城县吃不到猪肉呢？当然，最根本的原因，还是猪养得太少。据统计，禹城县今年只养猪一万二千多头，比1954年少养了二万头。但是，当前的问题是忽视了对当地供应一定数量的猪肉。国营食品公司今年计划在禹城县采购生猪6，300头。全县一共养猪一万二千多头，除了四千头母猪和相当数量的小猪外，要满足这个采购计划，必须要使大劲才能完成。因此凡是四十斤以上的生猪都被预购定购了，这样留给本县和农民自己吃的猪就没有或者很少了。
    农民吃不到猪肉，养猪的兴趣就更小了。禹城县辛店区目前小猪不断流向邻县，就是一个明证。据统计，辛店区四、五月份外流小猪即达六百多头，麦收以后又流向邻县近五十头。农民养猪的数字所以没有很快达到1954年的水平，和猪肉供应不好是有一定关系的。
