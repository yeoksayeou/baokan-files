Give Commune Members Time to Rest and Do Housework
    Must Act According to Capacity
    In many agricultural production cooperatives, there are currently two major tensions. One is the shortage of pocket money, which is the result of production diversification and neglect of commune members' household sideline production. This tension has already attracted the attention of relevant leading departments, and effective measures have been taken.
    The other is the strain on labor, which has resulted in the deterioration of commune members' health, with many people getting sick. However, many people are still afraid to face this problem squarely. According to a survey by the Fenglong Agricultural Cooperative in Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, from March to May, 20% to 50% of the male labor force worked overtime, day and night, to draw water, carry wheat, and transport manure; from the end of April to the beginning of May, 70% of the female commune members harvested wheat at night. Many commune members had to work on their private plots when they returned home, so they had to light lanterns and torches to work all night. Over time, this seriously damaged the health of commune members. Some people collapsed in the fields due to exhaustion. Yang Shaoyun, an elderly commune member in his seventies, was so tired that he had no choice but to hide in his daughter's house to rest for more than ten days. Some female commune members were assigned labor that they could not handle, and they cried from exhaustion. If this continues, people will develop an aversion to labor, and even fear labor. This phenomenon is contrary to our social system—the socialist system, where production is aimed at meeting people's needs.
    Of course, with the change of production relations, people's interest in labor has increased, and a high tide of production has emerged. This is the essence of rural life today and the mainstream. Our departments leading production must keep up with the pace to adapt to the needs of the new situation. However, if we do not face the existing production conditions and increase production content without limit, making the intensity of labor exceed the limits of what people can physiologically bear, then that is a wrong action.
    The Fenglong Cooperative is a key cooperative of the Weiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The county committee has achieved results in leading the production of this cooperative. However, the county committee lacked in-depth investigation and arranged work without regard to objective conditions, resulting in increased labor intensity and damage to the health of commune members. For example, when transplanting rice, the county committee required the cooperative to promote the highly dense "well-shaped seedlings" 100%, and then required the 100% promotion of "shovel seedlings" (according to the investigation: planting "shovel seedlings" was to solve the difficulty of insufficient base fertilizer, but many fertile fields in this cooperative did not need to plant "shovel seedlings"), and then arranged 100% promotion of cotton "square grid seedling transplanting". ... One 100% after another, wanting to do all the good things in one morning. As a result, during the spring plowing and sowing, the labor demand for agricultural production increased by 85% compared with the past, and sideline production increased three and a half times, resulting in a serious shortage of labor. Overtime and night work became frequently used magic weapons.
    However, the agricultural production season waits for no one. Even with overtime, the production needs could not be met, which also caused losses in production. The rice transplanting in Fenglong Cooperative was delayed by one season, the quality of work was rough, and there was generally one less harrowing and weeding (hoeing) than last year. Of the 198 mu of cotton, 70% was delayed in the planting season, and the survival rate was very low. For the cotton seedlings that were planted, 30% died per mu for those that died less, and 60% died for those that died more.
    May I ask, what good is it to act beyond one's capacity? Of course, "acting according to one's capacity" cannot become a shield for conservatism, but now many people are afraid of being labeled as conservatives, and they want to do things that are clearly beyond their capabilities, and they are afraid to face the fact that they have gone too far, and they are unwilling to change it.
    The Weiyuan County Committee is not like that. In June, they conducted an investigation in the Fenglong Cooperative and studied with the cadres and commune members of the Fenglong Cooperative, and took various measures to eliminate the excessive labor tension of commune members and solve the contradiction of insufficient labor. For example, according to the possible attendance of commune members, it was decided not to plant a second crop of corn on the more than 400 mu of intercropped sweet potato and corn land, in order to concentrate efforts on managing sweet potatoes. Originally, people were used to carry manure to the streets, but now they use existing roads and change to using carts to transport manure. In order to take care of commune members' personal production and housework, it was decided to allocate 10% to 20% of the total time throughout the year to commune members for personal use when arranging labor. These are all welcome measures, and the commune members are very satisfied.　Mu Shui

    No Money or Time to Repair Houses
    In the past month, houses in many villages in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, have collapsed due to rain. Most of the collapsed houses were the homes of members of agricultural production cooperatives. When the houses collapsed, five people were killed, seven were injured, and nine livestock were injured.
    Originally, many houses were dilapidated and needed to be repaired. In particular, the houses in the saline-alkali areas, mostly mud sheds and mud walls, were very fragile and needed to be repaired almost every year. However, since the beginning of this year, some agricultural production cooperatives have only cared about the production of the cooperatives and have not given commune members time to repair their houses. The commune members have no money to repair their houses, nor do they help to solve the problem, so that many houses that should be repaired cannot be repaired. Zhang Shitai, a poor peasant member of the Langtaimiao Agricultural Production Cooperative, asked the cooperative to lend him some money to repair his house, but the leading cadres of the cooperative never lent it to him. One night, the house collapsed, and Zhang Shitai was unfortunately killed. The cadres stationed in the Dongyang Village believed that the commune members' repairing of houses hindered the production of the cooperative, and twice asked the commune members to stop repairing houses and participate more in the production of the cooperative. This kind of phenomenon of not caring about the suffering of commune members is quite common. It is hoped that the relevant leading departments will help agricultural cooperatives improve their leadership and quickly eliminate this phenomenon.　Zhou Zhenghe

    The Other Side of the New Atmosphere
    I work in grain in Shanghai and also teach at an amateur school. Recently, I took a vacation and returned to Yangnan Township, Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province. I saw that the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in my township was doing a booming job in production, which was really a new atmosphere. However, when I talked to the peasant brothers, they all said that they were too tired to work and had no time to rest. The commune members here all went to the fields before dawn and did not finish work until the moon came up. After planting cotton, they harvested wheat and weeded the cotton fields. Of course, it is very busy during the busy agricultural season, and it is inevitable that the peasants feel tired. However, it is very bad to not let the commune members rest for a long time, which will cause over-fatigue and affect the health of the commune members. For example, the peasants in Qianjiawan Village of Xuzhu Branch of Yangnan Township, due to over-fatigue, two people fainted on the wheat field on the same day. The peasants here all hope to have adequate rest time, and hope that the relevant leading authorities can pay attention to this issue and meet their requirements.

    Rest Time is Taken Up
    Now is the time of long days and short nights, and the weather is hot. The peasants rely on resting at night to recover from fatigue after working all day. However, in some agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, the commune members' evenings are almost all occupied. Like the Shiqiao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, the commune members do not return from the fields until after 8 p.m. every day. After eating dinner, they have to run to the cooperative's office to hold meetings to evaluate the labor points they deserve for the day and listen to the distribution of work for the next day. Then, they either attend political classes, hygiene classes, or listen to the cooperative cadres convey instructions from higher authorities. By the time the commune members return home, it is already past 10 or 11 p.m. The cooperative cadres cannot go home until after 12 p.m., and they have to go to the fields again before 5 a.m. the next morning. The commune members can only sleep for an average of six hours a day, and they all feel that they are not getting enough rest.
    Female commune members with children are even more tired. They return from the fields with everyone every day, and they cannot eat immediately after returning. They have to feed their children first. After eating and coaxing the children to sleep, they have to hurry to the office. When they return from the office, sometimes the children wake up crying, and they have to coax the children to be good before they can sleep. Therefore, they all feel too tired and cannot support it.
    Agricultural cooperatives should change the old method of evaluating work points and recording scores every night, hold fewer meetings during the busy farming season, and allow commune members to get adequate rest.

### 给社员休息和做家事的时间

    给社员休息和做家事的时间
    必须量力而行
    不少农业生产合作社里，目前有两大紧张。一是零花钱紧张，这是生产单一化和忽视社员家庭副业生产的后果。这种紧张，已引起有关领导部门注意，采取了有效措施。
    一是劳动力使用紧张，带来的后果是社员健康恶化，生病的人很多。可是这个问题许多人还不敢正视。据四川省威远县奉龙农业社的调查：从三月到五月，有20％到50％的男劳动力加班加点，在夜间车水、挑麦子、运粪；四月底到五月初，有70％的女社员在晚上收小麦。许多社员回家，还要在自留地上劳动，只好打起灯笼火把连夜干。这样，日子久了，严重地损害了社员的健康。有的人在田里干活累倒在田埂上。七十多岁的老社员杨少云累得没办法，躲在他女儿家休息了十多天。有的女社员担任力不胜任的劳动，累得直哭。这样下去，人们就会对劳动产生厌恶情绪，甚至害怕劳动。这种现象，同我们的社会制度——生产是以满足人们的需要为目的的社会主义制度是相违背的。
    当然，随着生产关系的改变，人们劳动兴趣增长了，出现了生产高潮，这是今天农村生活的本质，是主流。我们领导生产的部门必须紧跟上去以适应新形势的需要。但如果不正视现有生产条件，无限制地增加生产内容，使劳动的强度超过人们生理所能负担的界限，那就是错误的行动。
    奉龙社是中共威远县委员会的重点社。县委会领导这个社的生产是有成绩的。但县委会缺乏深入的调查，布置工作不顾客观可能条件，造成了社员加大劳动强度，损害健康的后果。例如：在栽插水稻的时候，县委会要求这个社100％地推广高度密植的“井字秧”，接着又要求100％地推广“铲秧”，（据调查：栽“铲秧”是为了解决底肥不足的困难，但这个社有许多肥田是不需要栽“铲秧”的），接着又布置100％地推广棉花“方格育苗移栽”。……左一个100％，右一个100％，什么好事都想在一个早晨办好。结果，春耕播种的时候，农业生产需工量比过去增加85％，副业生产增加了三倍半，劳动力就严重不足了。加班加点、夜间劳动，便成为经常使用的法宝。
    但是，农业生产季节不能等人。就是加班加点也满足不了生产上的需要，这样，又造成了生产上的损失。奉龙社水稻栽插推迟了一个季节，活路质量粗糙，普遍比去年少一道中耕除草（薅秧）。一百九十八亩棉花，70％推迟了栽插季节，成活率很低。栽下去的棉苗每亩少的死掉30％，多的死了60％。
    试问，不量力而为又有什么好处呢？当然“量力而为”不能成为保守主义的挡箭牌，可是现在许多人却因为怕戴保守主义的帽子，明明力量来不及的事也要干，明知道干过火了还不敢正视，不愿改过来。
    威远县委倒不是这样的。六月间，他们已在奉龙社进行了调查，并和奉龙社干部、社员在一起进行研究，采取了各种措施消除社员劳动过分紧张和解决劳动力不足的矛盾。例如：根据社员可能出工的情况，四百多亩间作了甘薯又准备种二季玉米的玉米地，决定不再种二季玉米，以便集中力量管理甘薯。原来用人到街上挑粪，现在利用现成的公路，改用架架车运粪。为了照顾社员个人的生产和家务劳动，决定在安排劳动力的时候，把全年10％到20％的时间，拨给社员个人支配。这些都是值得欢迎的措施，社员很满意。　木水
    没钱没时间修整房子
    最近一个月来，我们河南省新乡县不少村子的房屋受雨倒塌。倒塌了的房屋大部分是农业生产合作社社员的住房。在房子倒塌的时候，砸死五个人，砸伤七个，砸伤牲口九头。
    本来，许多房屋都破旧了，需要修理。特别是沙碱地区的房屋，大部是泥棚泥墙，很不坚固，差不多每年都需要修整。可是，今年入春以来，有些农业生产合作社只顾社的生产，没有给社员一些修整房子的时间，社员没钱修整房子，也不帮助解决，以至许多当修理的房子不能修理。朗台庙农业生产合作社贫农社员张士太，要求社借给些钱修补房子，社的领导干部始终没有借给。一天夜里房子倒塌，张士太竟不幸被砸死了。东杨村的驻社干部认为社员修房子妨碍社的生产，曾两次叫社员停止修房子，多参加社的生产。这类不关心社员疾苦的现象相当普遍，希望有关领导部门帮助农业合作社改进领导，赶快消除这种现象。　周正和
    在新气象的另一面
    我在上海做粮食工作，兼任业余学校的教师。近日休假回到江苏省宝山县杨南乡，看到本乡星火农业生产合作社生产搞得轰轰烈烈，真是一片新气象。可是和农民弟兄们谈起来，都说干活太累，没有时间休息。这里的社员们，每天伸手不见五指已全体下田，到了月亮上来还不收工。种完棉花接着又是收割小麦，给棉田锄草。在农事紧张季节当然是很忙的，农民感到疲劳也是难免的。可是长期不让社员休息就很不好，就会造成疲劳过度，影响社员的健康。像杨南乡徐朱分社钱家湾宅的农民，因疲劳过度，有一天在收麦场上就有二人同时晕倒。这里的农民都希望有适当的休息时间，希望有关领导方面能注意这个问题，满足他们的要求。

    休息时间被占去了
    现在正是昼长夜短的日子，天气又炎热，农民们劳动了一整天，全靠晚上休息一下，恢复疲劳。可是在河北省石家庄市郊区的一些农业生产合作社里，社员晚上的时间差不多都被占用了。像石桥村农业生产合作社，社员每天下午八点多钟才从地里回来，吃过晚饭，就得往社的办公室跑，去开会评议当天应得的劳动工分，听候分配第二天的工作。接着，或者是上政治课、卫生课、听社干部传达上级指示。社员回到家里，已是十点多、十一点钟，社干部要十二点以后才能回家，第二天清早不到五点钟又得下地。社员平均每天只能睡六个钟头，都感到休息不过来。
    有孩子的女社员更累。她们每天和大家一起从地里回来，回来以后不能马上吃饭，得先给小孩喂奶。吃罢饭，孩子哄睡了，还得赶紧往办公室跑。从办公室回来，有时孩子哭醒了，还得哄乖了孩子才能睡。因此都感到太累，支持不了。
    农业社应该改变每天晚上评工记分的老办法，农忙时少开些会，让社员得到适当的休息。
