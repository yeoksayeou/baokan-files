    Specious Arguments
    The July issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated that in the eleven years since World War II, U.S. prices have risen by 70%, and one dollar is now worth only 52 cents compared to before the war. The magazine believes that one of the most fundamental reasons for rising prices and the devaluation of the dollar is the continuous increase in workers' wages, which increases costs, and inevitably leads to higher prices. The implication is that wage increases are of no benefit to workers in improving their lives. Anyone who remembers the vigorous development of the American workers' movement this year will not find it difficult to understand the purpose of American bourgeois newspapers' recent enthusiastic promotion of this argument.

    似是而非的论调
    七月一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，在二次世界大战以后的十一年中，美国物价上涨了70％，目前一美元只值战前的五角二分。这家杂志认为物价上涨和美元贬值最基本原因之一，就是由于工人工资不断增加，因此成本也增加，物价必然要上涨。言外之意，工资增加对工人改善生活并无好处。任何人只要想起今年美国工人运动的蓬勃开展，对美国资产阶级报刊近来热心宣传这种论调的目的，就不难理解了。
