    Unclear Investigation or Unwillingness to Investigate
    In mid-February of this year, the Leshan branch of the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate moved into the empty building after the Leshan Intermediate People's Court moved out. During the cleaning process, some confidential materials were found unhandled in the open space outside the office. Moreover, more than forty intact formal documents with the words "Top Secret" and "Secret" printed on them were found under a hole in the floor of the original Intermediate Court's receiving and dispatching office. After discovering this serious breach of secrecy, Li Jianyin, the deputy procurator of the Procuratorate, immediately called Liu Xiangdong, the presiding judge of the Intermediate Court, handed the documents back to him, and suggested that he investigate the matter. Subsequently, the Party Committee of the Prefectural Committee and the directly affiliated organs of the Special Commissioner's Office also instructed him to investigate the matter thoroughly (Liu Xiangdong is a Communist Party member). Later, the Party branch also urged him to do so multiple times. However, five months have passed, and the matter has still not been clarified.
    The evidence in this matter is so conclusive, and there are only a few people involved. Why hasn't it been clarified after five months of investigation?
    Therefore, people have reason to suspect whether this matter is truly impossible to investigate or simply an unwillingness to investigate.

    查不清还是不查清
    今年二月中旬，四川省人民检察院乐山分院搬进了乐山中级人民法院迁走后的空屋。在清扫工作中，发现在办公室外的空地上有些机密材料未加处理，而且在原中级法院收发室的地板洞下，找出了四十多张完整无损印有“绝密”“机密”字样的正式文件。发现这种严重的失密情况后，检察院李建寅副检察长当时就把中级法院的刘祥东庭长找来，把文件交还给他，并建议他追查这件事。接着地委和专署直属机关党委会也指示要他查清这件事（刘祥东是共产党员）。以后，党支部也曾多次督促过。但时间已过去五个月了，现在还是没有查清。
    这件事的证据如此确凿，而有关的人又只有寥寥几个，为什么查了五个月都查不清呢？
    因此，人们就有理由怀疑这件事究竟是查不清还是不查清呢？
