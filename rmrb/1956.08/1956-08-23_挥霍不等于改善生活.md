    Squandering Isn't the Same as Improving Life
    After the summer harvest, fifty-one members of the Qingdong Tenth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wukong Township, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, held eleven banquets, slaughtered a large fat pig, and spent more than one hundred yuan.
    Another strange thing also occurred in this county: During the summer harvest and planting season, the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jintong Township received 200 work points for supporting other production teams in the Fourth Team of the Second Brigade. They sold these 200 work points, bought wine and fish, slaughtered a pig, and had a big feast.
    With a bumper harvest and increased income, it's right to improve living standards; however, improving living standards isn't the same as squandering. Establishing cooperatives and increasing production were originally for the sake of living a good life. But to live an even better life, we must find ways to further increase production and invest more of the material resources increased by the bumper harvest into production. Furthermore, in years of good harvest, we must not forget years of poor harvest; storing grain against famine is still very important. Some areas are already experiencing floods and droughts, which should raise alarm.
    Farmers have always valued diligence and thrift, so why do they willingly squander the fruits of their labor? Perhaps they feel that after joining the cooperative, they have someone to rely on, and the government will provide relief if they suffer from disasters in the future; or perhaps they have other concerns. It's not enough to simply blame the farmers; local leading comrades should carefully consider this issue from all aspects.

    挥霍不等于改善生活
    江苏省江阴县悟空乡青东第十农业生产合作社五十一户社员，在夏收以后办了十一桌酒席，杀了一口大肥猪，花去了一百多元。
    还有一种奇怪的事情，也在这个县出现了：金童乡第二农业生产合作社在夏收夏种的时候，第二大队第四小队支援别的生产队，得到了二百个工分。他们把这二百个工分卖掉，买进酒和鱼，杀了一口猪，大吃了一顿。
    丰收了，收入增加了，改善生活是应该的；可是，改善生活并不等于挥霍。办社，增产，本来是为了过好日子。可是，要过更好的日子，还得想办法更多增产，把丰收中增加的物力更多地投到生产中去。再说，丰收年不能忘记歉收年，积谷防荒还是十分重要的。目前有些地区已经发生了水灾和旱象，更不能不引起警惕。
    农民本来是崇尚勤俭的，为什么却忍心挥霍自己的劳动果实？可能是他们觉得入社以后有了依靠，以后受了灾政府会救济；也可能是他们还有别的顾虑。光责怪农民也是不行的，当地的领导同志最好从各方面把这个问题好好想一想。
