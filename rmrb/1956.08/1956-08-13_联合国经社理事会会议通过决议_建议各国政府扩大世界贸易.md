Xinhua News Agency, Geneva: The 22nd session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council concluded on August 9th in Geneva. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Indonesia, and several other countries participated in the meeting.

Trade issues occupied a significant position at this session of the Council. Many representatives pointed out that the difficulties currently existing in the economies of capitalist countries are primarily caused by the expansion of armaments. They emphasized that disarmament and the normalization of international trade could have a positive impact on the economic development of all countries.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution on measures to expand trade cooperation. The resolution stated that further expansion of world trade is an extremely important factor that can promote the economic development of all countries in the world, improve international economic relations, and consolidate world peace. The resolution strongly recommends that governments not relax their efforts to expand world trade.

During the meeting, representatives from the United Kingdom and France repeatedly mentioned Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. On August 9th, before the close of the meeting, the French representative raised this issue again. The Egyptian representative attending the meeting emphasized that the Council had no right to discuss issues related to Egyptian sovereignty and protested against colonial powers attacking Egypt in an organization such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
