　　The Chinese Education Workers' Union recently held its Second National Congress in Beijing. It summarized and reviewed the union's work over the past six years and focused on studying how to further strengthen the work of the education union, and more fully mobilize the strength of the broad masses of education workers and scientific workers to serve socialist construction. This is a matter of great significance.

　　Our country's contingent of education and scientific workers has expanded from 700,000 in 1950 to 2.2 million now. They have become an indispensable and important force in our socialist construction. However, the fundamental issue at present is that all fronts of our socialist construction urgently require the broad masses of intellectuals to exert greater strength and make greater contributions, while the education and science sectors are not sufficient in all aspects to meet the needs of the rapidly developing socialist construction. Therefore, the main task of the education union in the future is to, under the leadership of the Party, deeply mobilize the masses, fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of education and science workers, lead this strong team of over two million people well, and strive to complete the state's education work plans and scientific research plans, so that our country's cultural, scientific, and technological levels can quickly catch up with advanced world levels.

　　To lead this team of over two million people well is certainly not an easy task. Therefore, the education union should pay attention to guiding the enthusiasm of education and science workers towards improving work and improving the quality of education and scientific research work through various activities. It should promptly discover, summarize, and exchange advanced experiences among the masses, organize mutual assistance and mutual learning, mobilize them to care about and discuss problems in their work, expose bureaucracy, put forward rationalization proposals, and extensively carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, educating the masses to treat their work with a socialist attitude towards labor. In addition, the education union must also help them create the necessary working conditions. At present, many education and science workers still do not have sufficient time for lesson preparation and scientific research. Some schools and scientific research institutions have not yet taken effective measures to reduce meetings, reduce concurrent jobs, and ensure that they have five-sixths of their time each week for professional work. Relevant agencies in many regions indiscriminately pull primary and secondary school teachers to participate in too many so-called central tasks, which affects the teachers' teaching and health. As for the issue of supplying necessary books, reference materials, equipment, and instruments to education and science workers, it has basically not been properly resolved in some small and medium-sized cities, especially in primary and secondary schools and grassroots scientific research institutions. All these problems add a lot of difficulties to the teaching and scientific research activities of the broad masses of education and science workers. The education union organization has the responsibility to go deep among the masses, promptly reflect the opinions and demands of education and science workers to the administrative side, propose solutions to the problems, and urge and help the relevant parties to solve them quickly.

　　Our Party and state have always been very caring for education workers and scientific workers. This spirit is fully embodied in many relevant policies and decrees. Guaranteeing and supervising the correct implementation of these policies is undoubtedly an important responsibility of the trade union organization. At present, some problems among senior intellectuals have attracted the attention of Party and government organs in various places, and many problems have been largely resolved. However, not enough attention has been paid to the problems of general intellectuals, especially primary and secondary school teachers. Currently, in some areas, especially in rural areas, there is still political discrimination against teachers, and the social status of teachers is not respected as it should be. Some district and township cadres treat teachers with an extremely rude attitude, and even violate laws and regulations, arbitrarily infringing on the human rights of teachers. Many agencies and cadres do not respect the labor of teachers, arbitrarily summon them to do whatever they want; they even make primary school teachers stand guard at night, keep watch, and send letters and cook for cadres, and so on. Discriminating against teachers is not only a manifestation of sectarian emotions that discriminate against intellectuals, but also a manifestation of the remnants of the ruling class's contempt for teachers in the old society. This phenomenon should be changed quickly. Local Party committees, relevant agencies, and education union organizations should actively safeguard the interests of teachers and fight against bureaucracy and violations of laws and regulations.

　　One of the regular tasks of the education union is to pay attention to caring for and improving the material and cultural life of education and science workers. Living problems are directly related to the work efficiency of education workers and scientific workers. Over the past few years, the state has set up welfare funds for education workers and scientific workers, implemented free medical care, and solved some life difficulties. However, problems in housing conditions, transportation conditions, old-age retirement, retirement due to illness, recuperation and rest, family medical care, maternity subsidies, and subsidies for multiple children have not yet been properly resolved. At present, there are more life difficulties among primary and secondary school teachers, and even the lives of professors and lecturers are not without difficulties. Some of these difficulties have been resolved by subsidies or appropriations. However, in the past, the education union failed to effectively supervise the serious situation of widespread and large-scale accumulation of welfare funds controlled by administrative departments, and even the diversion of these funds for other purposes. At the same time, the union's membership subsidies were not used well or rationally, so that many temporary or long-term difficulties among the masses were not resolved. This year, after the wage reform, the wages of many science and education workers have been increased to a certain extent, but difficulties still exist. Of course, some life difficulties cannot be solved in the short term, but as long as the trade union organization and relevant departments are truly concerned about these problems and try to solve them as much as possible, the living conditions of education and science workers will surely be greatly improved compared to the present.

　　The education union should continue to help education workers and scientific workers carry out self-education, strengthen workers' spare-time learning, and improve their ideological awareness and cultural level. Trade union organizations must often publicize Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies to their members, conduct patriotic and internationalist education, and in particular, should organize members to conduct self-education through observing and practicing social life. In the future, the education union should organize education and science workers to visit various socialist construction projects in an organized and planned manner, so that they can be educated here. Local Party organizations should also strengthen their leadership over education unions at all levels, and relevant administrative aspects should also actively support the work of the education union.

### 带好二百多万人的队伍

    带好二百多万人的队伍
    中国教育工会最近在北京召开了第二次全国代表大会，总结和检查了六年来的工会工作，并且着重研究了如何进一步加强教育工会的工作，更充分地动员广大的教育工作者和科学工作者的力量为社会主义建设服务的问题。这是一件具有重大意义的事情。
    我国的教育和科学工作者的队伍从1950年到现在，已经由七十万人扩大到二百二十万人，他们已经成为我国社会主义建设事业中一支不可缺少的重要力量。但是，当前的根本问题是，我国社会主义建设的各个战线上都迫切要求广大的知识分子发挥更大的力量，作出更多的贡献，而教育界和科学界在各方面都不足以适应社会主义建设急速发展的需要。因此，今后教育工会的主要任务就是要在党的领导下深入发动群众，充分发挥教育、科学工作者的积极性和创造性，带好这二百多万人的强大队伍，努力完成国家的教育工作计划和科学研究计划，使我国的文化科学技术水平能够迅速赶上世界先进水平。
    要带好这二百多万人的队伍当然不是容易的事。因此，教育工会要注意通过多种活动，把教育、科学工作者的积极性引导到改进工作、提高教育和科学研究工作质量方面去，及时地发现、总结和交流群众中的先进经验，组织互助互学，发动他们关心和讨论工作中的问题，揭发官僚主义，提出合理化建议，并且广泛开展自下而上的批评和自我批评，教育群众以社会主义的劳动态度对待工作。此外，教育工会还必须帮助他们创设必要的工作条件。现在，许多教育、科学工作者仍然没有较充裕的备课和进行科学研究的时间，一些学校和科学研究机关里还没有采取有效措施减少会议、减少兼职、切实保证他们每周有六分之五的时间用在业务工作上。许多地区的有关机关乱拉中、小学教师参加过多的所谓中心工作，以致影响教师们的教学和身体健康。至于对教育、科学工作者供应必要的图书参考资料、设备和仪器的问题，在一些中、小城市里，特别是在中、小学和基层的科学研究机关里，基本上没有得到妥善解决。所有这些问题，使广大教育、科学工作者在教学和科学研究活动上，增加了很多困难。教育工会组织有责任深入群众，及时向行政方面反映教育、科学工作者的意见和要求，提出解决问题的办法，并且督促和帮助有关方面迅速解决。
    我们的党和国家对于教育工作者和科学工作者一向是爱护备至的。这种精神在许多有关的政策和法令中都充分体现出来了。保证和监督这些政策的正确实施，无疑是工会组织的重要职责。目前，高级知识分子中的一些问题已经引起各地党政机关的重视，许多问题大体上得到了解决。但是，对于一般知识分子，特别是中、小学教师中的问题，还没有引起足够的重视。目前在一些地区特别是在农村还发生政治上歧视教师和教师的社会地位得不到应有的尊重的现象。有些区乡干部以极其粗暴的态度对待教师，甚至违法乱纪，任意侵犯教师的人权。许多机关和干部不尊重教师的劳动，随便呼来唤去任意使用；甚至让小学教师夜里站岗、守夜和给干部送信、做饭，等等。歧视教师不仅是一种歧视知识分子的宗派主义情绪的表现，也是旧社会统治阶级卑视教师的思想残余的表现。这种现象应该迅速改变。各地党委、有关机关和教育工会组织都应该积极地维护教师们的利益，同官僚主义和违法乱纪的现象作斗争。
    教育工会的经常任务之一就是要注意关怀和改善教育、科学工作者的物质文化生活。生活上的问题对于教育工作者和科学工作者的工作效果有着直接的关系。几年来，国家为教育工作者和科学工作者设置了福利费，实行了公费医疗，解决了某些生活上的困难问题。但是，在居住条件、交通条件、年老退休、因病退职、疗养休养、家属医疗、生育补助以及多子女补助等问题上，还没有得到妥善的解决。目前中、小学教师中生活上的困难问题较多，就是教授、讲师们的生活也不是没有困难的。这些困难，有些已经由补助费或者拨款解决。但是过去教育工会对行政部门所掌握的福利费普遍地、大量地积压，甚至移作别用的严重情况，没有进行有力的监督，同时对工会的会员补助金也没有很好地、合理地使用，致使群众中许多临时的或长期的困难问题没有得到解决。今年，经过工资改革，许多科学、教育工作者的工资有了一定的提高，但困难仍然是存在的。当然，有些生活上的困难问题不是短期内可以解决的，但是只要工会组织和有关部门真正关心这些问题，并且尽可能设法去解决，教育和科学工作者的生活条件就一定会比现在有很大的改善。
    教育工会应该继续帮助教育工作者和科学工作者进行自我教育，加强职工业余学习，提高他们的思想觉悟和文化水平。工会组织要经常向自己的会员宣传马克思列宁主义和党的政策，进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，特别是应该组织会员通过对社会生活的观察和实践进行自我教育。今后，教育工会应该有组织、有计划地组织教育、科学工作者参观各项社会主义建设，使他们从这里受到教育。各地党组织也要加强对各级教育工会的领导，有关行政方面也应该积极支持教育工会的工作。
