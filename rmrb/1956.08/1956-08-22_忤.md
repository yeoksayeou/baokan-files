The summer vacation had just begun when my fourth son first equipped himself with fishing gear, then moved the pots and jars for keeping crickets out from under the bed. Next, he was making a thin bamboo pole one or two times longer than the fishing rod. I couldn't help but ask him, "What are you going to use that for?" He said, "To catch dragonflies." I shook my head and said, "Looks like you're planning on having a lot of fun?"

Seeing me shake my head, he preemptively blocked my mouth with one sentence: "It's childhood, didn't you love to play when you were a kid too?"

To show that I was a father with plenty of self-criticism, and to immediately prove my repentance with action, I promised to go play with him on Sunday.

But—this "but," the reader can guess what follows: When Sunday came, there was something to do; the next Sunday, I couldn't muster the enthusiasm...

By the fifth Saturday, when I promised him "I'll definitely keep you company this time," the reader probably can't guess what he said, right? He bluntly said, "Forget it, I've already given up on you."

The child's despair towards me naturally seemed a bit premature, and this sentence therefore hurt my heart. But, having repeatedly broken my promises for four consecutive Sundays and first hurt his little heart, it was me.

    忤

    暑假刚开始，我那第四个儿子先把钓具配备了一番，又把装蟋蟀的盆盆罐罐从床底下搬了出来，接着，还在制造一种比钓竿还长一两倍的细竹杆。我又忍不住问他了：“这又是干什么用的？”他说：“粘蜻蜓。”我摇摇头说：“看样子你打算大玩特玩了？”
    他见我摇头，先发制人，一句话塞住了我的咀：“儿童时代吗，您小时候不也是爱玩的？”
    我为了表示是个满有自我批评精神的爸爸，而且马上用行动来证明悔悟，答应星期天跟他一起去玩。
    可是——这一个可是，读者就猜得到下文是：到了星期天，有事情；下一个星期天，又提不起兴致。……
    到第五个星期六，我又答应他“这回保险奉陪”时，读者可不一定猜得到他说什么了吧，他老实不客气说：“算了吧，我对您已经绝望了。”
    孩子对我的绝望自然显得早了一些，这句话因此伤了我的心。但是，接连四个星期天轻诺寡信、先伤了他那小小的心的，是我。
