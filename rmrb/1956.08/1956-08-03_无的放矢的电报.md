    Aimless Telegrams
    For several months, the leadership of the Jingmen County People's Committee of Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, has been troubled: they are unable to process many of the telegram instructions sent by the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office.
    Why do the instructions from the higher-level leading organs become impossible to handle once they reach the lower levels? It turns out that these telegrams are "aimless." For example, on February 29th, the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent a telegram about greening the Yangtze River and the Han River, but Jingmen County has neither the Yangtze River nor the Han River within its borders. How can there be a task of greening the Yangtze River and the Han River? Again, on April 22nd, the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent a telegram about resolving disputes over lake grass, but Jingmen County has no lakes at all. What "lake grass disputes" need to be resolved there? Furthermore, on June 26th, the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent an urgent telegram about doing a good job in flood prevention, but Jingmen County is a mountainous area, neither bordering a river nor the sea. Where does the flood prevention task come from?
    As a leading organ, the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office is so ignorant of what its subordinate county has and does not have, what it can do and cannot do. People have reason to suspect that the principle of adapting to local conditions and providing specific leadership, which the Party has repeatedly emphasized, has not yet been put on the agenda for improving the leadership style of the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office.

    无的放矢的电报
    几个月来，湖北省荆州专区京山县人民委员会领导上有一个苦恼：他们对荆州专署发来的电报指示，有许多都无法批办。
    上级领导机关的指示为什么一到下面会变得无法办理了呢？原来这些电报是“无的放矢”的，比如二月二十九日，荆州专署发来一个绿化长江、绿化汉水的电报，而在京山县县境内既无长江，又无汉水，何来绿化长江，绿化汉水的任务呢？再如四月二十二日，荆州专署发了一件解决湖草纠纷的电报，而京山县根本没有湖，那里有什么“湖草纠纷”要解决呢？又如六月二十六日荆州专署又发来一份作好防汛工作的加急电报，但京山县是一片山区，一不滨江，二不临海，防汛任务又从何说起呢？
    作为一个领导机关的荆州专署，对自己领导的县有什么，没什么，能作什么，不能作什么竟然如此无知，人们就有理由怀疑，党所一再强调的因地制宜，具体领导是不是还没有进入荆州专署改进领导作风的议事日程呢？
