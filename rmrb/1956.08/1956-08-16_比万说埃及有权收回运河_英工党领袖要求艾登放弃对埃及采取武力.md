Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: London News – British Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan published an article in "Tribune" on August 10th, saying, "Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal is undeniable, and this right is inseparable from its sovereignty over property on its own territory."
He said, "Any attempt to oppose it (Egypt) in this regard not only violates its legitimate actions to safeguard its national status, but will also deeply resent all countries that have seen imperialist countries exploit their natural resources, thereby strengthening actions to safeguard national status through the struggle against imperialism."
Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th – British Labour leaders Gaitskell, Griffiths, and Robens visited Prime Minister Eden at 10 Downing Street on the morning of August 14th, urging the government not to take military action against Egypt beyond the scope of the United Nations Charter. They also demanded that the conclusions of the upcoming London conference be submitted to a special session of the United Nations General Assembly and that Parliament be reconvened immediately after the London conference ends.
These demands were made to the government based on a resolution passed at a special meeting of the Labour Party's "Shadow Cabinet" on August 13th.

    比万说埃及有权收回运河
    英工党领袖要求艾登放弃对埃及采取武力
    据新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党左翼领袖比万八月十日在“论坛周报”发表文章说：“埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的权利是无可争议的，这种权利和它对本国领土上的财产的主权是分不开的。”
    他说：“任何反对它（埃及）在这方面的权利的企图，都不仅干犯了它维护国家地位的正当行为，并且还会使得一切曾经看到帝国主义国家榨取它们的自然资源的国家深深地忿恨起来，从而使维护国家地位的行动因反对帝国主义的斗争而得到加强。
    据新华社伦敦15日电　英国工党领袖盖次克尔、葛莱菲斯、罗本斯八月十四日早上到唐宁街十号访问首相艾登，要求政府不要超出联合国宪章的范围而对埃及采取武力行动。他们还要求把即将举行的伦敦会议的结论提交给联合国大会特别会议，并且在伦敦会议结束以后立即召集议会复会。
    这些要求是根据八月十三日举行的工党“在野内阁”特别会议的决议向政府提出的。
