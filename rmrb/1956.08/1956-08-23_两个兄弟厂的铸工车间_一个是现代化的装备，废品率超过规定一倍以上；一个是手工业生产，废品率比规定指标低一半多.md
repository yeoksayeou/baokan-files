The Foundry Workshops of Two Brother Factories
One with Modern Equipment, Waste Rate Exceeds Regulations by More Than Double; One with Handicraft Production, Waste Rate More Than Half Lower Than Prescribed Targets
Zhou Jingyu

In July, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant failed to complete its production tasks, mainly due to poor quality castings.

The product quality of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's foundry workshop is becoming increasingly unstable. The scrap rate in February of this year was 10.96%, and in July it soared to 14.45%, exceeding the prescribed quality targets by more than double. The machining workshop often processed to the most precise level, only to suddenly encounter sand holes and air pockets, and had to be scrapped. Although the Party committee also conducted education on the importance of quality, there was no significant improvement.

Is it because the casting conditions are not good? No. This is the first workshop in the country with modern equipment.

Is it a problem with technical strength? Also no. The chief engineer of this workshop has decades of work experience, and his technical level is considered first-class in the country. The deputy director of the workshop is an old foundry worker with more than twenty years of experience and rich work experience.

Is it a problem with the process regulations? Also no. The process regulations here were formulated with the help of Soviet experts. When the Soviet experts were here, the yield rate of castings was very high, but after the Soviet experts left, the quality gradually became unguaranteed.

So, where exactly is the problem? Some situations were reflected in the discussions of the inspectors.

Usually, inspectors in the foundry workshop often quarreled with workers and leaders about casting quality issues.

Once, the workshop used asphalt sand to make molds for the 1д63 lathe. According to the process regulations, after the mold was made, it had to be dried to a depth of 40 cm before it could be used. However, the operators only dried it to 20 cm and were sloppy about it. The inspector asked for re-baking, and the operators reported to the leadership, and the branch secretary and the workshop director immediately rushed to the scene to question the inspector.

The inspector said it couldn't be used according to the process regulations. The workshop director said: This box of work can be used as an experiment. Thus, a quarrel ended under the excuse of "experimentation."

The workshop leadership put the implementation of process regulations in opposition to the completion of production tasks, believing that strict implementation of process regulations would affect the completion of tasks. They also believed that the work of the workshop inspectors was only to "suggest suggestions," and whether or not to decide was not the inspector's business. The inspector sighed infinitely and said: "We are wasting our efforts here."

The production plan of the workshop is very chaotic, without a complete processing route procedure. Sometimes, the inspector receives the processing route sheet but cannot find the casting there. Every day, there are many people in the casting workshop asking for accounts, and some castings are pulled away as soon as they are cast. Some castings are sent for quenching without being repaired or welded, and no one is responsible for castings that need to be welded. The workshop inspector also feels helpless in this situation.

Process regulations cannot be changed casually. However, this workshop has great "flexibility" in implementing process regulations. Engineering and technical personnel divide the process into major and minor, and the minor parts ignore the process regulations. The melting furnace often uses first-grade iron to pour second-grade products, and second-grade iron to pour third-grade products. On July 29, because the iron water poured exceeded the specified hardness, eight lathe beds were scrapped at once.

The management of the workshop is chaotic. There is a division of labor between the workshop director and the deputy director, but no connection. Those in charge of production do not ask about technology, and those in charge of technology do not ask about production, while the workshop director manages everything but cannot manage anything well. Some new workers urgently need to improve their technical level and solve problems encountered in their work, but technical engineers rarely go deep into the sections to help them. Equipment accidents and personal accidents occur constantly, and overtime work by workers has almost become a daily occurrence. The core-making department often has more than 50 workers extending their working hours to about 12 hours, and some workers work for 16 hours at a stretch without anyone caring.

This is the basic situation of the workshop. Of course, there are also objective difficulties, such as late delivery of wooden molds, urgent product requests, and inaccurate wooden molds, which are prone to deformation, all of which have a certain impact on casting work. However, despite some objective difficulties, the phenomenon of high casting scrap rates is not inevitable.

In the brother factory of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant—the foundry workshop of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant—the situation is completely opposite. Their quality is generally relatively stable, and the scrap rate decreases month by month. In July, the No. 2 Machine Tool Plant produced 544 tons of castings, with 15 tons of scrap, a scrap rate of less than 3%. This not only met the indicators required by the higher authorities but also was more than half lower than the indicators.

Here, there is no mechanized or automated equipment, only some technical modifications have been carried out. It is basically still backward manual operation. There are also no first-class technical engineers like in the No. 1 Plant, but ordinary-level casting staff.

It seems like a miracle, but there is actually no special mystery. It simply has different characteristics from the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.

The Party leaders of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's foundry workshop take the lead in neglecting quality, while the Party branch of the No. 2 Plant supervises and guarantees the improvement of product quality politically and ideologically. This is the first characteristic.

In 1954, the foundry workshop of the No. 2 Plant was the workshop with the highest scrap rate in the entire plant. At that time, the scrap rate reached more than 33%, and the workers were unwilling to implement piece-rate wages, the situation was very serious. Therefore, solving the quality problem became an urgent task for the Party and the administration.

They bravely took on this task. They mobilized technical personnel to study the casting data of mechanical factories in Shanghai, Jinan, and other places, discussed the reasons for improving quality in the same type of factory, and conducted extensive education among employees to make the majority of employees clearly recognize the significance of improving product quality.

They strictly required Communist Party members to play an exemplary role in improving product quality, and severely criticized Party members who neglected quality at branch meetings. For example, Party member Hou Jincai, who served as the technical director, did not take effective measures for non-conforming large furnace iron water, resulting in defective parts, and was severely criticized. The non-Party masses attending the meeting were also educated.

In a word, the Party organization has played its due role in educating workers to value quality, organizing workers to learn technology, and mobilizing workers to carry out labor competitions.

The foundry workshop of the No. 2 Machine Tool Plant is very serious in implementing process regulations, unlike the foundry workshop of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, which has such great "flexibility." This is also a characteristic.

In the past, some old workers in the No. 2 Plant always felt that using scientific instruments was a bit troublesome. For example, Wen Xiqing, a large furnace worker, never used a pyrometer, but just looked at it to determine the temperature. Chen Xirong, an old worker, did not use hardness instruments, but just touched it with his hand to determine the hardness specifications. Now, they use scientific instruments to replace empiricism.

Some workbenches have established three systems to ensure the implementation of process regulations. One system is called the after-shift meeting, which uses a very short time after work to talk about the main problems in production. One is called three inspections, that is, after the product is made, check it yourself, check each other, and spot check when necessary. The third is called "taking process rules as production discipline." These systems have played a great role. Ma Youde, a sand molding worker who seriously neglected quality in the past, has achieved 100% product quality for four consecutive months under this system.

The last characteristic: the leaders of this workshop have consistent thinking and consistent actions, forming a core force. Major issues in the workshop are carefully studied and discussed by the branch committee. Comrade Zhao Yanjing, director of the workshop, said: I report all the main tasks assigned to me by the factory director to the branch, and then implement them specifically according to the principles decided by the branch committee. It is precisely because the responsible comrades of the branch and the administration pay attention to collective leadership that they are very orderly in production management. Unfortunately, the foundry workshop of the No. 1 Mechanical Plant is relatively weak in this regard.

I visited the foundry workshops of two brother factories. In the modern foundry workshop of the No. 1 Plant, except for the sand preparation department working in an orderly manner, walking into the molding department inevitably makes people feel "chaotic." Various sand mold models are spread all over the large and medium-sized sections. The inspector led me to climb over many castings before I didn't get lost. In the basically manual operation foundry workshop of the No. 2 Plant, everything is proceeding in an orderly manner, steadily moving towards civilized production.

The foundry workshop is the first process in the entire plant's production. If the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant does not take emergency measures to rectify this workshop, it will not only directly affect the processing of parts and the manufacturing of tools in this plant, affecting orders from Jinan, Beijing, and other plants, but also affect the production tasks for the second half of the year and the plan for next year. It is still difficult to estimate how much loss this impact will cause.

### 两个兄弟厂的铸工车间  一个是现代化的装备，废品率超过规定一倍以上；一个是手工业生产，废品率比规定指标低一半多

    两个兄弟厂的铸工车间
    一个是现代化的装备，废品率超过规定一倍以上；一个是手工业生产，废品率比规定指标低一半多
    周静宇
   七月份，沈阳第一机床厂没有完成生产任务，主要问题是铸件质量不好。
    机床一厂铸工车间的产品质量越来越不稳定。今年二月份的废品率是10.96％，七月份即高达14.45％，超过了规定的质量指标一倍以上。加工车间常常加工到最精密程度的时候，忽然碰到了沙眼、气孔，不得已，只好报废。党委虽然也进行了重视质量的教育，但是没有什么显著的好转。
    是铸造的条件不好吗？不。这是全国第一个现代化装备的车间。
    是技术力量的问题吗？也不是。这个车间的总工程师有几十年的工作经验，他的技术水平在全国也算是第一流的。车间的副主任是一个有二十几年工龄的老翻砂工人，有丰富的工作经验。
    是工艺规程的问题吗？也不是。这里的工艺规程是在苏联专家帮助下制定的，当苏联专家在这里的时候，铸件的成品率很高，只是苏联专家走了以后，质量才逐渐没有保证。
    那么，问题究竟在那里呢？从检查员的谈论中反映了一些情况。
    平时，铸工车间的检查员为了铸件的质量问题经常和工人、领导人员发生争吵。
    有一次，车间用沥青砂制作1д63车床砂型，按照工艺规程要求，砂型制成以后，必须干燥到四十糎深度才能使用。可是，操作人员只干燥到二十糎就马马虎虎地算了，检查员要求重烘，操作人员就向领导方面反映，支部书记和车间主任立即赶到现场责问检查员。
    检查员根据工艺规程，说不能用。车间主任却说：这箱活作为试验，可以用。于是，一场争吵就在“试验”的借口下不了了之。
    车间领导方面把执行工艺规程和完成生产任务对立起来，认为严格执行工艺规程就会影响任务的完成。他们还认为，车间检查员的工作只是“建议建议”，决定与否，就不是检查员的事了。检查员无限慨叹地说：“我们在这里白使劲。”
    车间的生产计划很乱，没有完整的加工路线程序。有时候，检查员接到了加工路线单，却找不到铸件在那里。每天，铸造车间要账的人多，有些铸件刚刚铸完就被拉走了。有的铸件没有经过修正、浇焊，就送去焖火，有的铸件需要补焊的也无人负责。这种情况，车间检查员也深感无能为力。
    工艺规程是不能随便改变的。但是，这个车间在执行工艺规程的时候有着很大的“灵活性”，工程技术人员把工艺分出主要的和次要的，次要的部分就不顾工艺规程。熔化炉经常用一级铁倒铸二级活，用二级铁倒铸三级活，七月二十九日，因为倒的铁水超过了规定的硬度，一次就报废了八个车床床身。
    车间的管理混乱，车间主任同副主任之间有分工而无联系，管生产的不问技术，管技术的不问生产，而车间主任什么也管，什么也管不起来。有些新工人迫切需要提高技术水平，解决工作上遇到的问题，而技术工程师很少深入工段帮助他们。设备事故和人身事故不断发生，工人加点几乎成为日常生活，泥芯工部经常有五十多名工人延长工作时间到十二小时左右，有的工人一连干十六小时，也无人过问。
    这就是车间的基本情况。当然，客观困难也是有的，例如木型交得晚，产品催得急，木型不准，容易变形，这都给铸造工作带来一定的影响。但是，尽管客观上有一些困难，铸件废品率高的现象并不是不可避免的。
    在沈阳机床一厂的兄弟工厂——沈阳第二机床厂的铸工车间里，情况却完全相反。他们的质量一般做到相对的稳定，而且废品率逐月下降。七月份，机床二厂铸件五百四十四吨，废品十五吨，废品率还不到百分之三，不但达到上级要求的指标，而且比指标降低了一半多。
    这里，没有机械化、自动化的装备，只进行过部分的技术改造，基本上还是落后的手工操作。这里也没有像一厂那样拥有全国第一流的技术工程师，而是普通水平的铸件工作人员。
    看起来，似乎是个奇迹，实际上并没有什么特别的奥妙。只是有着同机床一厂不同的特点。
    机床一厂铸工车间党的领导人员带头忽视质量，机床二厂的党支部是从政治上、思想上监督与保证提高产品质量。这是第一个特点。
    在1954年，二厂铸工车间是全厂废品率最高的车间。当时废品率达到33％以上，工人们不愿实行计件工资，情况十分严重，因此解决质量问题，成了党和行政的紧急任务。
    他们勇敢地担当起这个任务。他们发动技术人员研究上海、济南等机械工厂铸件的资料，讨论同一类型厂提高质量的原因，并深入广泛地向职工进行教育，使广大职工明确认识提高产品质量的意义。
    他们严格要求共产党员在提高产品质量方面起模范作用，在支部大会上严肃地批判了忽视质量的党员。例如党员侯金才担任技术主任工作，对于不合规格的大炉铁水不采取有效的措施，造成了废件，受到了严厉的批评。列席会议的非党群众，也受到了教育。
    一句话，党组织在教育工人重视质量、组织工人学习技术、发动工人开展劳动竞赛等方面，都发挥了应有的作用。
    机床二厂铸工车间在贯彻工艺规程上很认真，不像机床一厂铸工车间有那样大的“灵活性”，也是一个特点。
    过去，二厂也曾有一些老工人总觉得使用科学仪器有些麻烦。像大炉工人文锡清从来不用高温器，只是看一看来断定温度的高低，老工人陈喜荣也不用硬度的仪器，只要用手摸一摸来断定硬度规格，现在，他们用科学仪器代替了经验主义。
    有的工作台订了三项制度保证工艺规程的贯彻。一个制度叫做班后会，利用下班以后很短时间，谈谈生产上的主要问题。一个叫做三检，就是产品做出以后，自己检查一下，互相检查一下，必要的时候抽查一下。第三个叫做“以工艺守则为生产纪律”。这些制度起了很大的作用。过去严重忽视质量的砂型工人马有德，在这个制度下，产品质量一连四个月达到100％。
    最后一个特点：这个车间领导方面，思想一致、行动一致，形成了核心力量，车间的重大问题都是经过支委会议认真研究和讨论的。车间主任赵炎景同志说：凡是厂长交给我的主要任务，我都向支部汇报，然后，根据支委会决定的原则具体执行。正由于支部和行政的负责同志注意了集体领导，他们在生产管理上也就很有秩序。可惜机械一厂铸工车间恰恰在这方面是比较薄弱的。
    我访问了两个兄弟工厂的铸工车间。在一厂的现代化的铸造车间里，除了制砂部在有秩序地工作以外，走到造型部总不免使人有“乱”的感觉，各种各样的砂型模型铺满了大型工段和中型工段，检查员带领我翻越许多铸具，才没有迷失道路。在二厂的基本上是手工作业的铸造车间里，一切都在有秩序地进行，稳步地走向文明生产。
    铸工车间是全厂生产的头一道工序。机床一厂如果不采取紧急措施，整顿这个车间，那末，不仅直接影响本厂零件的加工和工具的制造，影响到济南、北京等厂的订货，而且更影响下半年的生产任务和明年的计划。这种影响会造成多大的损失，现在还难以估量。
