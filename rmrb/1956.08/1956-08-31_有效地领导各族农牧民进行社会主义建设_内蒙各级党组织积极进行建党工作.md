Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 29th: The Party building work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is progressing rapidly. As of now, the autonomous region has more than 167,000 Party members from various ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, and Daur.

Since the second half of last year, the Party's construction work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of development. During the agricultural cooperation movement, Party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region combined the work of consolidating and establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives with the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and universally carried out Party building and Party consolidation work. The number of Party members in rural Inner Mongolia, which was only more than 50,000 a year ago, has now increased to more than 100,000. Now, in agricultural areas, basically every village has a Party branch, and in pastoral areas, more than a quarter of the villages have established Party branches. Through continuous consolidation, the ideological awareness of Party members and the combat effectiveness of Party organizations have been improved.

Currently, more than 90% of Party members in rural areas have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and some hold various leading positions. Many Party members and branches are actively organizing, mobilizing, and leading the masses to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's agricultural production tasks. The Party General Branch of the Taohua Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Tumet Banner, because it carried out very meticulous ideological work among its members, ensured the smooth implementation of various measures to increase production, thus enabling the land, which originally only produced more than 200 jin of grain per mu, to produce 400 jin this year, an increase of 80% compared with last year, ensuring increased income for more than 90% of its members. Thanks to the leadership of party members, the Darihei and Jingge Pastoral Cooperative in the New Barag Right Banner of Hulunbuir League, changed the past single production situation of "only guarding animal husbandry", and adopted a method of combining agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations to expand the scope of operations and increase the income of its members. At the same time, due to the improvement of livestock feeding management, the survival rate of young animals this year reached 97% to 99%, exceeding the highest level of young animal survival rate in the banner's history. In order to further develop the Party ranks, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed Party organizations at all levels to further develop a group of new Party members and consolidate and improve the Party's grassroots organizations in a planned and led manner. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels are instructed to pay attention to overcoming the current shortcomings in Party building work, such as emphasizing quantity over quality, lack of attention to Party building in areas and departments where the Party's strength is weak and among intellectuals, and insufficient integration of Party consolidation work with the central task, and outdated methods.

    有效地领导各族农牧民进行社会主义建设
    内蒙各级党组织积极进行建党工作
    新华社呼和浩特29日电　内蒙古自治区的建党工作进展很快。截至目前为止，自治区已经有十六万七千多名蒙、汉、回、满、达呼尔等各民族党员。
    从去年下半年以来，内蒙古自治区的党的建设工作，进入了一个新的发展阶段。在农业合作化运动中，自治区各级党组织结合整顿、建立农业生产合作社的工作和肃清反革命分子的斗争，普遍地进行了建党、整党工作。一年前只有五万多名党员的内蒙古农村，现在已经增加到十万多名。现在在农业区已经基本上做到村村有支部，牧业区也有四分之一以上村建立起了党的支部。这些支部经过不断的整顿，党员的觉悟水平和党组织的战斗力都有了提高。
    目前农村90％以上的党员都参加了农业生产合作社，有的还担任各种领导职务。很多党员和支部都积极组织、动员和领导群众争取完成与超额完成今年的农业生产任务。土默特旗桃花农业生产合作社党总支，因为对社员进行了非常细致的思想工作，保证了合作社各项增产措施的顺利实现，因而使原来每亩只出产二百多斤粮食的土地，今年出产了四百斤，比去年增产80％，保证90％以上的社员增加收入。呼伦贝尔盟新巴尔虎右翼旗达日黑和静格牧业社由于党员们的带头，改变了过去“唯守牧业”的单一的生产情况，采取农、牧、副业兼营的办法扩大了经营范围，增加了社员收入。同时由于改进了对牲畜的饲养管理，使今年的幼畜成活率达到了97％到99％，超过了这个旗历来幼畜成活率的最高水平。为了进一步发展党的队伍，中共内蒙古自治区委员会最近指示各级党组织，必须进一步有计划有领导地发展一批新党员和整顿提高党的基层组织。同时责成各级党组织注意克服目前建党工作中存在的重量不重质、对党的力量薄弱地区和部门以及知识分子中建党问题缺乏重视，以及整党工作与中心工作结合不够，方法老一套等缺点。
