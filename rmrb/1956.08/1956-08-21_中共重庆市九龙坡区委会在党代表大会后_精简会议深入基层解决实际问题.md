    The CPC Chongqing Jiulongpo District Committee Simplifies Meetings and Goes Deep into Grassroots to Solve Practical Problems After the Party Congress
    (Our Newspaper News) After the CPC Chongqing Jiulongpo District Committee held its first Party Congress in April this year, it focused on criticizing the bureaucratic work style of the district committee leadership, characterized by too many meetings, too many documents, and insufficient in-depth work, as well as the subjective approach in thinking. Over the past three months, the leadership style of the district committee has improved, and some achievements have been made in its work.
    The meetings and issued documents of the district committee have gradually decreased. In the past, the district committee often held two or three meetings per week, sometimes even more, and the meeting times were not fixed, often disrupting the work of various departments. The district committee also convened many meetings at the grassroots level. After the District Party Congress, the new district committee made a great determination to streamline meetings, deciding to resolutely not hold meetings that could be avoided, and requiring the district committee's approval for meetings involving a large number of people. It also emphasized that meetings should be prepared and have a focus. General reports on current affairs and policies should be delegated to people to go down or convene meetings by region, to make it convenient for grassroots cadres as much as possible and reduce travel time. Necessary control was also exercised over documents: insisting that all documents must be reviewed and signed by the responsible comrades of the departments, and streamlining documents that could be issued or not issued and unnecessary documents. At the same time, it was also emphasized that if a problem could be solved by holding a meeting, a document should not be issued; if cadres could be sent down to understand the situation, grassroots cadres should not be asked to write reports or fill out forms. As a result of doing so, the district committee now holds a maximum of two district committee meetings per week, and the number of district committee meetings for the next month and the issues to be discussed at each meeting are arranged by the end of the previous month; the number of meetings convened for grassroots cadres has also decreased; and the number of documents issued by the district committee has been greatly reduced, with the average monthly issuance in the second quarter decreasing by 150,000 words compared to the first quarter.
    With the simplification of meetings and documents, the leading cadres of the district committee also began to free themselves from the circle of meetings and document approval, and went down to the grassroots more frequently to inspect work. Leading cadres who had not been to the grassroots for a long time also went down several times to inspect work. Recently, the secretary of the district committee and several other leading cadres organized five work groups, using a week to go deep into factories and hospitals and other units to inspect work and help these units discover and solve some major problems. For example, one work group went to the Xinhua Printing Factory, which had failed to complete the state's various planned targets for six consecutive months this year. The work group conducted an in-depth and meticulous inspection of the work of the factory's party organization and put forward suggestions for improvement. The factory's party organization was satisfied and is working on improvements.
    The Jiulongpo District Committee also attached importance to the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and achieved certain results. In the past, when cadres of the district committee went down to the grassroots to inspect work, they often only paid attention to finding shortcomings and problems, and rarely discovered new things and the slightest advanced experiences. After the district's Party Congress, the district committee educated the cadres, and there has been a change. In the past few months, the advanced experiences of more than ten advanced units and individuals summarized and introduced by various departments of the district committee. For example, at the political work conference of the financial and trade departments held by the district committee at the end of July, it introduced the slight experiences of two branches in leading the advanced worker movement, which was well received by grassroots cadres. After the Industrial Department of the District Committee summarized and introduced the experience of the Chongqing Sulfuric Acid Plant Branch in breaking down conservative ideas and mobilizing technical personnel in the product quality excellence movement, so that sulfuric acid reached and exceeded the quality standards stipulated by the central government, it also played a role in promoting the development of the movement. Other departments of the District Committee have also gradually established a good atmosphere of summarizing and introducing advanced experiences. (Zeng Qinghong)

    中共重庆市九龙坡区委会在党代表大会后
    精简会议深入基层解决实际问题
    本报讯　中共重庆市九龙坡区在今年四月召开的第一次党代表大会上，集中地批判了区委领导上的会议多、文件多、领导不深入的官僚主义作风和思想方法上的主观主义以后，三个多月来，这个区委的领导作风有了改进，工作取得了一些成绩。
    这个区委的会议和印发的文件逐渐减少了。过去区委每周往往开会两三次，有时甚至还多，开会时间也不固定，时常打乱部门的工作。区委召开基层的会议同样很多。区党代表大会以后，新的区委下了很大的决心精简会议，决定可开可不开的会议坚决不开，牵涉群众面大的会议要经过区委批准，并强调开会要有准备、有中心，一般的时事政策报告就派人下去或分片召集，尽量使基层干部方便，减少往返时间。对文件也作了必要的控制：坚持一切文件都必须经过部门负责同志审阅签发，精简了可发可不发的文件和不必要的文件。同时，还强调能开会解决的就不要发文，能派干部下去了解情况的就不要基层干部写报告或填送表报。这样做的结果，现在区委每周最多召开两次区委会议，而且在上月底就安排好下月区委会议次数和每次会议讨论的问题；召集基层干部开会的次数也减少了；区委机关印发的文件则大大减少，第二季度比一季度平均每月发文减少十五万字。
    随着会议、文件的精简，区委领导干部也开始从开会、审批公文的圈子里解脱出来，比较经常地深入基层去检查工作。过去长期不下基层的领导干部，也多次下去检查工作了。最近，这个区委的书记和其他几个领导干部又分别组织了五个工作组，用一周的时间，深入工厂和医院等单位，检查工作，帮助这些单位发现和解决一些重大问题。例如一个工作组到了新华印刷厂，这个厂今年连续六个月没有完成国家各项计划指标。工作组对这个厂的党组织的工作进行了深入细致的检查，提出了改进意见，这个厂党组织感到满意，正在改进工作中。
    九龙坡区委还重视了总结和推广先进经验的工作，并取得了一定的成绩。在过去，区委机关干部下基层检查工作时往往只注意找缺点、找问题，很少去发现新生事物和点滴的先进经验。在区的党代表大会以后，这个区委向干部进行了教育，有了转变。几个月来，区委各部总结介绍的先进单位和个人的先进经验在十个以上。例如：区委在七月底召开的财经贸易部门的政治工作会议上，介绍了两个支部领导先进工作者运动的点滴经验，基层干部都反映很好。区委工业部总结介绍了重庆造酸厂支部在产品质量优良运动中打破保守思想和发动技术人员，使硫酸达到和超过中央规定的质量标准的经验以后，对运动的开展也起了推动作用。区委其他各部也都逐渐树立了总结和介绍先进经验的良好风气。　（曾庆鸿）
