Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 13th: More than one hundred commercial workers departed from Xining on the 11th to work in the Qaidam Basin. In the future, batches of commercial workers will continue to go to the Qaidam Basin.

In Da Qaidam, where the Qaidam administrative organs are located, commercial organizations such as trade companies, catering service companies, and vegetable, food, and grocery companies have been successively established. Twenty-six supply points in petroleum exploration areas such as Mangai, Lenghu, and Mahai, and the Yuka Coal Mine are being set up one after another. The establishment of these institutions will bring convenience to the tens of thousands of workers who are diligently working in the vast Qaidam Basin.

As commercial institutions are successively established, a large number of non-staple foods and daily necessities are being continuously transported into the Qaidam Basin.
