    On the Illegality of the So-Called Plan for "International Control" of the Suez Canal
    Wang Tieya
    Fair-minded public opinion throughout the world has unanimously pointed out that the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a reasonable and legitimate action. The Suez Canal is an inseparable part of Egyptian national territory, and the Canal Company is an Egyptian company subject to Egyptian national law. According to international law, Egypt has the right to nationalize it, which is beyond any doubt; and Egypt's nationalization action does not violate any of the international obligations undertaken by Egypt. Moreover, the Egyptian decree nationalizing the canal stipulates that Egypt will compensate all shareholders of the company at the stock market price on the day before the nationalization. The Egyptian government has also formally declared that it respects all international obligations undertaken by Egypt and guarantees that freedom of navigation on the canal will not be affected or implicated in any way or to any extent.
    However, colonial countries have never reconciled themselves to the actions of independent countries to safeguard their legitimate rights. Since Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have exhausted their ability to clamor, scold, and slander, and even openly created a "Suez crisis" to threaten Egypt with force. In order to confuse international public opinion, these colonial countries have repeatedly lied, describing Egypt's just action as "an act of robbery." At the same time, they have spared no effort to distort international law, describing Egypt's legitimate sovereign action as "a gross violation of international law." The problem is very clear: it is not Egypt that is violating international law, but these colonial countries. Since the tripartite London talks of Britain, France, and the United States, these countries, on the one hand, have continued to deploy troops, attempting to force Egypt to submit by force; on the other hand, they have proposed convening an international conference to discuss the so-called plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal, plotting to cancel Egypt's nationalization of the canal through this plan, so as to achieve the goal of permanently controlling the canal. It should be pointed out that this so-called "international control" plan has no basis in international law, and the demand to implement such a plan for the Suez Canal is completely illegal.
    The so-called plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal, according to French Foreign Minister Pineau, is to establish an international management and administrative body with very broad powers to be responsible for the operation of the Suez Canal for an unlimited period. According to the joint communiqué of the tripartite London talks of Britain, France, and the United States, the Suez Canal is "an international waterway" and the Canal Company is "an international institution." Therefore, their logic is to hand over this canal to "international control." After the communiqué was issued, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the United States repeatedly emphasized the "international nature" of the Suez Canal and the Canal Company, and vigorously promoted that only "international control" can guarantee freedom of navigation. This statement is extremely absurd.
    First of all, it must be clarified that the Suez Canal Company is not "an international institution," and the Suez Canal itself is not "an international waterway." Although most of the Suez Canal Company's shares are owned by foreigners and the company's board of directors is located abroad, the company is registered in Egypt and, according to the express provisions of the 1866 contract, the company must comply with Egyptian law. This company is obviously not "an international institution," but an Egyptian company. Although the Suez Canal itself is subject to freedom of navigation under international treaties because it is an interoceanic canal, the canal itself is within Egyptian territory and is an inseparable part of Egyptian territory. This canal is clearly not "an international waterway," but a canal owned by Egypt. In fact, the 1888 Constantinople Convention takes the Suez Canal belonging to Egypt as the premise for all its provisions. The 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement explicitly recognizes that the Suez Canal "is an integral part of Egypt." Although this agreement mentions that the canal is "a waterway of international importance in economic, commercial and strategic terms," the provision of "international importance" does not mean that the Suez Canal is "an international waterway," nor does it deny that it is a canal belonging to Egypt.
    Since the Suez Canal Company is not "an international institution" and the canal itself is not "an international waterway," there is no reason to hand over this canal to "international control." In fact, the so-called plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal has no basis in the international treaties concerning this canal. The most important international treaty—the 1888 Constantinople Convention—stipulates the freedom of navigation on this canal; none of its seventeen articles stipulates "international control." On the contrary, Article 8 of this treaty expressly stipulates that the responsibility for implementing this treaty lies with Egypt, and the Egyptian government shall take appropriate measures to ensure the safety and free navigation of the canal. Judging from this treaty, the issue of "international control" simply does not arise. The 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement also only stipulates that the two countries "express their determination to uphold the Convention signed at Constantinople on 29 October, 1888, guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal." This agreement does not give Britain any right to demand the so-called "international control" of the Suez Canal.
    It should be said that the so-called plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal cannot become an obligation stipulated by international treaties, because such a plan fundamentally violates the principle of national sovereignty in international law. If the purpose of such a plan is to cancel Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, then all fair-minded jurists believe that Egypt's action is a legitimate sovereign action, and the so-called "international control" plan is an illegal interference in legitimate sovereign action. More importantly, the purpose of such a plan is to further use an "international management and administrative body" to directly control the Suez Canal. In this way, the so-called "international control" plan constitutes a serious violation of Egypt's territorial sovereignty.
    The principle of national territorial sovereignty in international law is very clear. It is generally recognized that territory belongs to the state, and the state has supreme power over its territory. This is a basic principle of international law. British international law scholar Brierly once said: "The concept that a state occupies a specific part of the earth's surface, within which the state ordinarily exercises jurisdiction over persons and things to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of other states, subject only to limitations imposed by international law, is the foundation of international law." A state's sovereignty over its territory does not allow any infringement, which is the principle that territorial sovereignty is sacred and inviolable. American international law scholar Moore also said: "A state possesses and exercises absolute and exclusive jurisdiction within its own territory, and any exception to this right must be based on the express or implied consent of the state. This is a universally recognized principle in the international arena." Therefore, the attempt by Britain, France, and the United States to forcibly implement the so-called "international control" plan, thereby infringing upon Egypt's sovereign rights over the Suez Canal, a part of its own territory, is obviously a serious violation of the principle of territorial sovereignty in international law.
    According to international law, all rivers and lakes within a state's territory belong to the state, that is, they are part of the state's territory; this is true for natural rivers and also for artificial canals. Since the Suez Canal is within Egyptian territory, it cannot but belong to Egypt, that is, an inseparable part of Egyptian territory. Egypt has absolute and exclusive sovereign rights over it. Brierly said: "In the absence of treaty stipulations, a canal is under the sole control of the state in which the canal is located." The Suez Canal is within Egyptian territory. Apart from guaranteeing freedom of navigation, Egypt has no other obligations stipulated by any international treaty. Egypt's sovereign rights over this canal should not be subject to any other restrictions. Although the Suez Canal is an interoceanic canal, it does not therefore have a special legal status. As American international law scholar Hackworth admitted: "While some interoceanic canals possess commercial and strategic importance, these practical considerations themselves do not give these interoceanic canals a special legal status." Therefore, when the Egyptian government has already declared that it guarantees freedom of navigation, the attempt by Britain, France, and the United States to impose the so-called "international control" plan on Egypt, making Egypt lose control over a part of its own territory, is without any basis in international law and is completely incompatible with the principle of territorial sovereignty.
    The communiqué of the tripartite London talks of Britain, France, and the United States recognizes that "Egypt enjoys all the rights of a fully sovereign and independent state." Since this is the case, Britain, France, and the United States should respect Egypt's legitimate rights over its own territory. However, on the contrary, they create a so-called "international control" plan, by which they control the Suez Canal and attribute the so-called "honor of ownership" of the canal to Egypt. This is just a deceptive lie. It should be affirmed that the so-called plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal violates Egypt's territorial sovereignty, violates the principle of territorial sovereignty in international law, and is illegal. Such an illegal plan cannot solve any problems. The Egyptian people, with the support of the people of the world, are united as one and are waging a resolute struggle to safeguard their national territorial sovereignty. It is a delusion for colonial countries to try to achieve their goals through such an illegal plan.

    论所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划的非法性
    王铁崖
    全世界的公正舆论已经一致指出，埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是一个合情合理的行动。苏彝士运河是埃及国家领土的不可分割的部分，运河公司是埃及公司，服从埃及国家法律的管辖。按照国际法，埃及有权收归国有，是不容有任何疑问的；而埃及的收归国有的行动，也丝毫没有违背埃及所承担的国际义务。并且，埃及把运河收归国有的法令规定，埃及将按照收归国有前一天的股票市场价格补偿公司的全体股东。埃及政府还正式声明尊重埃及所承担的一切国际义务，保证运河的航行自由不会以任何方式或在任何程度上受到影响或连累。
    但是，殖民国家从来不甘心于独立国家维护自己的合法权利的行动。自从埃及宣布把苏彝士运河公司收归国有之后，英、法、美等国就极尽叫嚣、谩骂、诬蔑之能事，甚至公开制造“苏彝士的危机”，对埃及进行武力威胁。为了混乱国际听闻，这些殖民国家一再信口胡说，把埃及的正义行动说成“抢劫的行为”，同时，它们还不惜歪曲国际法，把埃及的合法的主权行动说成“粗暴的违反国际法的行为”。问题是很清楚的，违反国际法的决不是埃及，而是这些殖民国家。自从英、法、美三国伦敦会谈之后，这些国家一面仍然调兵遣将，企图以武力威胁迫使埃及屈服；另一面建议召开国际会议讨论所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划，阴谋通过这个计划来取消埃及把运河收归国有的行动，从而达到运河归它们永久控制的目的。应该指出，这所谓“国际管制”的计划在国际法上是毫无根据的，要求对苏彝士运河实行这样的计划是完全非法的。
    所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划，照法国外长比诺说法，就是要成立一个拥有非常广泛权力的国际管理和行政机构在无限的时间内负责经营苏彝士运河的事务。据英、法、美三国伦敦会谈的联合公报的说法，苏彝士运河是“一条国际水道”，运河公司是“一个国际机构”，因而它们的逻辑就是要把这条运河交给“国际管制”。公报发表后，英、法、美三国外长一再强调苏彝士运河和运河公司的“国际性质”，并且极力宣传：只有“国际管制”才能保证航行自由。这种说法是极其荒谬的。
    首先必须弄清楚，苏彝士运河公司不是“一个国际机构”，苏彝士运河本身也不是“一条国际水道”。苏彝士运河公司的股票固然大部分为外国人所拥有，公司董事会固然设在外国，但是，公司是在埃及注册的，而且按照1866年合同的明文规定，公司要服从埃及的法律；这个公司显然不是“一个国际机构”，而是一个埃及公司。苏彝士运河本身固然由于它是通洋运河而经国际条约规定航行自由，但是，运河本身是在埃及领土之内，是埃及领土的不可分割的一部分；这条运河显然不是“一条国际水道”，而是属于埃及所有的运河。事实上，1888年的君士坦丁堡公约就以苏彝士运河属于埃及为其一切规定的前提。1954年英埃两国订立的协定又明文承认苏彝士运河“是埃及的不可分割的一部分”。这个协定固然提到，这条运河是“一条在经济上、商业上和战略上具有国际重要性的水道”，但是，“具有国际重要性”的规定并不等于说苏彝士运河是“一条国际水道”，也并不因而否认它是属于埃及的运河。
    既然苏彝士运河公司不是“一个国际机构”，运河本身也不是“一条国际水道”，就没有理由把这条运河交给“国际管制”。实际上，所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划在有关这条运河的国际条约上是没有任何根据的。最主要的国际条约——1888年的君士坦丁堡公约所规定的是这条运河的航行自由；在它的十七条条文中没有一条规定到“国际管制”。相反地，这个条约第八条明文规定，实施这个条约的责任在于埃及，埃及政府采取适当措施以保证运河的安全和自由通航。从这个条约看来，根本不发生“国际管制”的问题。1954年英埃协定所规定的也只是两国“表示决心维护1888年10月29日在君士坦丁堡签订的保证在苏彝士运河有通航自由的协定”。这个协定并没有给英国以任何权利来要求对苏彝士运河实行所谓“国际管制”。
    应该说，所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划不可能成为国际条约规定的义务，因为这样的计划是根本违反国际法的关于国家主权的原则的。如果这样的计划的目的是取消埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动，那么，一切公正的法学家都认为埃及的行动是合法的主权行动，所谓“国际管制”的计划就是对合法的主权行动的非法干涉。更重要的，这样的计划的目的还要进一步用“国际管理和行政机构”来直接控制苏彝士运河，这样，所谓“国际管制”的计划就构成对于埃及的领土主权的严重侵犯。
    国际法上关于国家的领土主权的原则是十分明确的。大家公认，领土属于国家所有，国家对于它的领土具有最高的权力，这是国际法的基本原则。英国国际法学者布莱利曾经这样说过：“一个国家占有土地表面的一个特定部分，在这个部分内国家除受国际法所设定的限制外通常行使对人和物的管辖权而排斥其他国家的管辖权，这个概念是国际法的基础。”国家对自己领土的主权不容任何方面的侵犯，这是领土主权神圣不可侵犯的原则。美国国际法学者摩尔也说过：“一个国家拥有并且在它自己领土内行使绝对的和排他的管辖权，而这个权利的任何例外必须有国家的明示或默示同意的根据，这是国际上一个公认的原则。”因此，英、法、美三国企图强迫实行所谓“国际管制”的计划，从而侵害埃及对于自己领土一部分的苏彝士运河的主权权利，就显然是对国际法上关于领土主权原则的严重破坏。
    按照国际法，国家领土内的一切河流和湖泊都是属于国家所有，也就是国家领土的一部分；自然河流是如此，人工建造的运河也是如此。苏彝士运河既然是在埃及领土内，它就不可能不属于埃及所有，也就是埃及领土的不可分割的部分，埃及对于它有绝对的和排他的主权权利。布莱利说过：“在没有条约规定的情形下，一条运河属于该运河所在地国家的单独控制。”苏彝士运河是在埃及领土之内，埃及除了保证航行自由之外并无其他任何国际条约规定的义务，埃及对于这条运河的主权权利就不应受任何其他的限制。苏彝士运河固然是一条通洋运河，但是，它并不因此而在法律上具有特殊的地位。正如美国国际法学者哈克倭斯所承认：“固然一些通洋运河拥有商务和战略上的重要性，但这些实际考虑本身并不使这些通洋运河具有特殊法律地位。”因此，在埃及政府已经声明保证航行自由的时候，英、法、美三国还企图把所谓“国际管制”的计划强加于埃及，使埃及对于自己领土的一部分失去控制，这是在国际法上毫无根据的，也是与领土主权原则完全不相容的。
    英、法、美三国伦敦会谈的公报承认：“埃及享有一个完全自主独立国家的一切权利”。既然如此，英、法、美三国就应该尊重埃及对于自己领土的合法权利。但是，相反地，它们制造所谓“国际管制”的计划，由它们控制苏彝士运河，把所谓运河的“所有权的荣誉”归于埃及，这只是一种骗人的谎话。应该肯定地说，所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划侵犯埃及的领土主权，违反国际法上关于领土主权的原则，是非法的。这样非法的计划是不能解决任何问题的。埃及人民正在全世界人民的支持下团结一致，为维护自己国家领土主权而进行坚决的斗争。殖民国家要想通过这样非法的计划来达到它们的目的，那是一种妄想。
