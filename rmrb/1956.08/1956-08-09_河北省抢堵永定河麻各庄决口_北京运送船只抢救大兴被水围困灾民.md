Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 8th: The Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters is actively planning to block the Magaozhuang breach on the Yongding River and divert the floodwaters to ensure the safety of the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway.

Due to the sharp rise in the Yongding River's water level, the northern embankment of the Yongding River at Magaozhuang, Daxing County, breached early in the morning of the 7th. Some of the floodwaters flowed eastward from the breach, threatening the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway. The Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters is taking emergency measures. Xu Zheng, Director of the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, led technical cadres and personnel familiar with the local situation to the breach site yesterday to assist the local flood control departments in the rescue efforts. At the same time, one million catties of reed material are being rushed from Tianjin Prefecture to provide support. In addition, it is planned to breach the northern embankment of the Yongding River near Mangdian in Anci County, downstream of the breach, to divert the floodwaters into the Yongding River flood area, preventing the flood from inundating the railway.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Beijing dispatched more than 400 cadres, boatmen, drivers, and porters yesterday, driving 63 vehicles and transporting 300 boats to Daxing County, Hebei Province, to rescue flood-stranded residents. Another batch of large trucks is waiting to carry other flood control equipment to support the disaster-stricken areas in Hebei.

In the afternoon of the 7th, after the Beijing Municipal People's Committee learned that some counties in Hebei Province were flooded, it immediately issued an emergency notice requiring relevant units to actively participate in the rescue work. Upon receiving the notice, the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company immediately issued a call to all employees. Most of the drivers, assistants, and porters who had returned from their shifts actively responded to the call and participated in this work. Parks in the city also enthusiastically contributed boats and organized boatmen to participate in the rescue work.

    河北省抢堵永定河麻各庄决口
    北京运送船只抢救大兴被水围困灾民
    新华社保定8日电　河北省防汛指挥部正积极筹划堵塞永定河麻各庄决口和疏导决口洪水，保障北京—山海关铁路安全。
    由于永定河水猛涨，大兴县麻各庄永定河北堤在七日早晨决口。部分洪水从口门外溢东流，威胁到京山铁路。河北省防汛指挥部正采取紧急措施，河北省水利厅厅长徐正已在昨天率领技术干部和熟悉当地情况的人员赶赴决口地点，协助当地防汛部门抢堵，同时从天津专区赶运一百万斤苇料支援。此外，计划在决口下游的安次县芒店附近扒开永定河北堤，疏导决口洪水泄入永定河泛区，不使洪水冲淹铁路。
    据新华社8日讯　北京市昨天派出了四百多名干部、船工、司机、搬运工人，驾驶六十三辆汽车，运送了三百只船，前往河北省大兴县，抢救被水围困的灾民。另外有一批大汽车正等待载运其他防汛器材去支援河北受灾地区。
    七日下午，北京市人民委员会知道了河北省有些县积水成灾后，立刻发出了紧急通知，要求有关单位积极参加抢救工作。北京市汽车运输公司接到通知，立即向全公司职工发出号召，所有下班回来的司机、助手、搬运工人大部分都积极响应号召，参加了这一工作。市内各公园也踊跃抽出船只，组织船工参加抢救工作。
