Xinhua News Agency, 10th. With the development of construction, the state has provided multifaceted assistance to the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers involved in construction. In 1955, the state's expenditure on preferential treatment amounted to over 213 million yuan. This was stated today to Xinhua reporters by the person in charge of the Preferential Treatment Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The person in charge of the Preferential Treatment Bureau said that in 1955, the state used more than 85.25 million yuan for living and production subsidies for families of martyrs and families of servicemen, benefiting a total of more than 10.14 million individuals. Relevant authorities in various regions not only provided subsidies to alleviate the difficulties in the lives of families of martyrs and families of servicemen but also provided subsidies to address the difficulties these families faced regarding production and lack of means of production for participating in agricultural production cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from 438 counties and cities and one autonomous prefecture in eleven provinces and autonomous regions, more than 300,500 families of martyrs and families of servicemen received subsidies for means of production.

In 1955, more than 414,000 children of revolutionary martyrs were enrolled in schools with state funding, and another 3,300 orphans of martyrs received state education.

The state also allocated significant funds for providing pensions to families of deceased and ill personnel, providing pensions to disabled personnel, and educating disabled revolutionary soldiers. The state also allocated more than 9.11 million yuan to build sanatoriums for the severely disabled. By the end of 1955, there were 2,045 sanatorium beds for disabled revolutionary soldiers nationwide. In addition, a large number of demobilized soldiers involved in construction received state care after returning to their hometowns. In 1955, more than 1.25 million demobilized soldiers involved in construction received state subsidies due to old age and illness affecting their livelihoods.

The person in charge said that the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers involved in construction are very grateful for the state's assistance and actively participate in labor production and various socialist constructions of the country. A large number of activists have emerged.
