    Fujian Jinjiang Special District: Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese Landlord and Rich Peasant Households Change Class Status

    (Our report) In June and July, various overseas Chinese hometowns in Fujian Province's Jinjiang Special District, in conjunction with inspecting and publicizing the implementation of overseas Chinese affairs policies, and in accordance with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program's Forty Articles and the Fourth National Overseas Chinese Affairs Expanded Conference, have changed the class status of more than 1,260 overseas Chinese households who were classified as landlords and rich peasants to farmers, based on the conditions of "loving the country and abiding by the law, abandoning exploitation," and have allowed them to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. After being educated, these overseas Chinese households whose class status was changed generally expressed gratitude to the government for its care and consideration, and stated that they would further improve production and abide by government policies and laws. When Shantou Town, Nan'an County, changed the class status of twenty-two overseas Chinese landlord and rich peasant households in mid-July, five households wrote letters to their relatives overseas to share the good news on the same day. After her class status was changed, overseas Chinese dependent Lü Meiying, on the one hand, reported the good news to her relatives overseas, and on the other hand, requested to join the agricultural cooperative, and expressed that after joining the cooperative, she would actively labor and improve agricultural production.

    福建晋江专区千余户华侨地主富农改变成份
    本报讯　福建省晋江专区各地侨乡六、七月份已结合检查宣传贯彻侨务政策，按照全国农业发展纲要四十条和全国第四次侨务扩大会议的精神，根据“爱国守法、放弃剥削”的条件，把1，260多户地主和富农成份的华侨，改称为农民，并允许他们参加农业生产合作社。这些被改变成份的侨户，经过教育后，普遍感激政府对他们的关怀和照顾，表示要进一步搞好生产，遵守政府政策法令。南安县山头镇于七月中旬改变二十二户华侨地主、富农的成份时，当天就有五户写信向海外亲人报喜。侨眷吕美英，成份改变后，一面向海外亲人报喜，一面要求参加农业社，并表示入社后要积极劳动，搞好农业生产。
