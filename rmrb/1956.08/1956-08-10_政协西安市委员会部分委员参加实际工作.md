Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th - Some sixteen members of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPPCC have recently participated in practical work such as gardening and education, in which they are skilled and interested.

    These sixteen members are between the ages of fifty and seventy. In the past, in addition to participating in political consultation work, they were relatively free. Recently, encouraged by the high tide of socialist construction, everyone is highly motivated and willing to contribute more to the cause of socialist construction. According to their respective strengths and interests, as well as physical conditions, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPPCC introduced them to practical work. Member Wang Xuzhai is very interested in gardening and has more than ten years of experience in cultivating fruit trees. This time, he was introduced to work in the orchard of the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry. Members Guan Houfu, Wu Yunfang, and others are very enthusiastic about mass literacy education and have respectively participated in the work of the anti-illiteracy committees in Beilin, Xincheng, and other districts.

    After these sixteen members participated in practical work, they were welcomed and cared for by various units. They are also active and responsible in their work.
