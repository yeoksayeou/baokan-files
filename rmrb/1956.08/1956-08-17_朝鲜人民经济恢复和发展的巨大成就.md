The Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition held in Pyongyang on August 14 to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea has opened. This is the largest post-war exhibition in Korea.

The exhibition is arranged into seventeen exhibition halls according to different economic sectors such as metal, machinery, light industry, and agriculture.

Approximately 2,500 kinds of industrial and agricultural products are on display, along with nearly 100 models of various industrial and mining enterprises, large and small.

The exhibits are mostly industrial products, some of which had their production interrupted in Korea in the past, while others are new products since the war.

In the exhibition halls, there are high-performance Model 1A-62 lathes and Model 736 planers, shiny black special steel, ammonium sulfate fertilizer resembling white salt, models of 100-ton class or larger trawlers, ocean-going fishing vessels, and passenger ships, seeders capable of sowing several kinds of seeds such as corn, sorghum, and vegetables, automatic threshers that can thresh five tons of corn per day, brightly colored and exquisitely patterned silk, various colored cotton fabrics, knitwear, as well as bicycles, sewing machines, radios, and various plastic and glass products. Almost all items needed in large quantities by various domestic economic sectors, as well as daily necessities for the people, are available. The quality of many products has reached a considerably high level.

All the pictures in the exhibition halls clearly show that Korea's industrial and agricultural production is rapidly recovering and developing today. The production of various sectors of the people's economy, which have been reborn from the ruins and ashes after the war, has successively surpassed or approached the pre-war 1949 level.

The metallurgical industry, which completed its three-year plan ahead of schedule, will exceed the three-year plan by 37% by the end of this year. The output of ferrous and non-ferrous metals had already exceeded pre-war levels by the end of last year, and it is expected to exceed pre-war output by more than 29% and 25% respectively by the end of this year. Machine tools only began to be produced after the war, and this year's output will double that of last year. This year's ship production is equal to more than 1.6 times the pre-war level. Electrical equipment production exceeds eight times the pre-war level. By the end of this year, the total output value of light industry will be equal to twice the pre-war level, cotton fabric production will be equal to more than seven times the pre-war level, and silk fabric production will also exceed the pre-war level. By the end of this year, brick production will exceed fourteen times the pre-war level.

Judging from the development of agricultural production, the grain output in northern Korea in 1949 was 139.9% of that in 1946, and this year's output will reach 143.9% of that in 1946.

The exhibition displays models of many enterprises using advanced methods for production, making it clear that along with the rapid recovery and development of the Korean people's economy, industrial and agricultural production technology has been raised to a new level. In the metal industry hall, the Iron Mountain mine model is most attractive to people. Today, the mining, transportation, and separation operations of this mine have all been mechanized, while before liberation, production was carried out entirely by manual labor. Due to this improvement in operations, labor productivity has increased nearly twenty-seven times this year compared to before liberation, and output has increased to more than twenty-six times. Today, whether in the industrial, mining sectors, or in construction, agriculture, and other sectors, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation are gradually being realized.

In each exhibition hall, people can also see the beautiful prospects of the five-year plan, which will be implemented starting next year, telling people that the development of Korea's industrial and agricultural production will enter a new upsurge in the future. During the five-year plan period, Korea's power industry will have great development. By the last year of the five-year plan, power generation and irrigation electricity will increase by nearly one time compared with this year. By 1961, metal industry production will grow to 2.4 times the pre-war level. The annual output of the Chongjin Steel Plant will grow to 4.9 times the pre-war level. The total output value of light industry will increase four times compared to the pre-war level, of which cotton fabrics will be equal to eleven times the pre-war level. Grain output will also be higher than last year, equal to 163.5% of 1946.

When the Korean people joyfully celebrate the "August 15" Liberation Anniversary, the Korean government has announced that the industrial gross output value plan in the post-war three-year economic plan has been victoriously completed ahead of schedule. On the industrial front, the socialist economic strength is incomparably strong, the rural economy has also basically achieved socialist transformation, and the cooperative movement of handicrafts has also had considerable development. The new five-year plan will continue to develop forward on this basis.

    朝鲜人民经济恢复和发展的巨大成就
    崔佳山
    为庆祝朝鲜解放十一周年而举行的工农业展览会，八月十四日在平壤开幕了。这是朝鲜战后规模最大的一次展览会。
    展览会按着金属、机械、轻工业和农业等不同经济部门布置了十七个展览馆。
    展出的各种工农业产品约有二千五百种，各工矿企业的大小模型近一百种。
    展览会陈列的实物大多数是工业品，这些产品有的朝鲜过去中断过生产，有的是战后的新产品。
    在各展览馆里，陈列着有高度性能的一A六二型旋床和七三六型刨床，有乌黑发亮的特殊钢材，像白盐似的硫铵肥料，一百吨级以上的拖网渔轮、远航渔轮和客船模型，能播种玉米、高粱、蔬菜等好几种种籽的播种机，一天可脱粒五吨玉米的自动脱粒机，色彩鲜明、花纹精致的丝绸，各色棉布、针织品，以及自行车、缝纫机、收音机和各种塑胶、玻璃制品，举凡国内各经济部门所大量需用以及人民生活必需的物品，几乎应有尽有。有不少产品的质量已经达到相当高的水平。
    各展览馆里所有的图片向人们明白地表明：今天朝鲜的工农业生产正在飞快地恢复和发展着。战后从废墟和灰烬中重新生长起来的各人民经济部门的生产，已经先后超过或接近战前1949年的水平。
    早已完成三年计划的金属工业到今年年底将可以超额37％完成三年计划，黑色和有色金属产量在去年年底就已经超过战前的水平，预计到今年年底将分别超过战前产量的29％和25％以上。工作母机从战后才开始生产，今年产量将比去年增加一倍。今年船舶的生产等于战前的一点六倍以上。电气器材生产超过战前的八倍。到今年年底轻工业的总产值将等于战前的二倍，棉织品产量等于战前的七倍以上，绢织物产量也超过了战前。到今年年底，砖产量将超过战前十四倍以上。
    从农业生产的发展情况来看，1949年朝鲜北部的谷物产量为1946年的139.9％，而今年的产量将达到1946年的143.9％。
    展览会展出许多企业使用先进方法进行生产的模型，使人们一看就知道在朝鲜人民经济迅速恢复发展的同时，工农业生产技术已经提高到新的水平。在金属工业馆里，最吸引人们注意的是铁山矿山的模型。今天，这座矿山的采掘、运送、分离等作业都已经机械化了，而在解放前是完全使用人工进行生产的。由于操作方面的这种改进，今年和解放前相比，劳动生产率提高了将近二十七倍，产量提高到二十六倍以上。在今天，无论在工业、矿业部门或者是建设、农业等部门，都逐渐在实现机械化、半自动化和自动化。
    在各个展览馆里，人们还可以看到从明年开始执行的五年计划的美好远景，它告诉人们今后朝鲜工农业生产的发展将进入一个新的高涨。在五年计划期间，朝鲜的电力工业将有很大的发展，到五年计划最后的一年发电量和灌溉用电都将比今年增加将近一倍。到1961年，金属工业生产将增长到战前的二点四倍。清津炼钢厂的年产量将增长到战前的四点九倍。轻工业的总产值将比战前增加四倍，其中棉织物将等于战前十一倍。谷物产量也将比去年高，将等于1946年的163.5％。
    当朝鲜人民喜气洋洋地欢度“八·一五”解放纪念日的时候，朝鲜政府已经宣布，战后三年经济计划中的工业总产值计划已经胜利地提前完成。在工业战线上社会主义经济力量已经无比的强大，农村经济也已经基本上实现了社会主义改造，手工业的合作化运动也已经有相当的发展。新的五年计划将在这个基础上继续向前发展。
