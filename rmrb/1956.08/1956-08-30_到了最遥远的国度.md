    Arrived in the Farthest Country
　　Wan Guang
    The Chinese Art Troupe arrived in Santiago, the capital of Chile, on August 16. Whether traveling from the east or the west, Chile is one of the countries farthest from China. The Chinese artists traveled from the Eastern Hemisphere to the Western Hemisphere, and from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. Chile is located at the southern end of the Western Hemisphere. The name "Chile," according to the meaning of the Aymara people, an indigenous tribe, means "at the end of the earth."
    In the past few years, to promote cultural exchange and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between peoples of various countries, art envoys of New China have visited many countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Now, for the first time, they have come to a country in the Americas.
    This time, the art troupe will introduce Chinese Peking Opera, folk dances, and songs, as well as Chinese instrumental performances, to the public in the Americas. In terms of Peking Opera, Li Shaochun, Zhang Yunxi, Yuan Shihai, Du Jinfang, Yun Yanming, Zhang Chunhua, and Li Zongyi, who enjoy high reputation in the motherland, have all come. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, leads the art troupe, with Zhao Feng and Wang Li as deputy leaders. The entire troupe consists of eighty-seven people.
    The art troupe departed from Beijing in early August, flying around most of the globe. Starting from Beijing, they passed through the Mongolian People's Republic, the vast territory of the Soviet Union, and over Poland, arriving in Czechoslovakia. Continuing from the golden Prague, they flew over southern Germany, arriving in Switzerland. In this country known as the "world park," the art troupe stayed for a few days. Then, they began the journey from Switzerland to Santiago. Crossing over southern France and northern Spain, they reached the airport in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. From there, continuing to fly, they saw the calm surface of the Atlantic Ocean through the clouds. After flying along the western edge of the Atlantic for a while, they entered the airspace above a sandy area along the coast, which is the western edge of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa. The plane made a brief stop at Dakar, French West Africa, a transportation hub protruding into the Atlantic in northeastern Africa, before crossing the Atlantic to the Southern Hemisphere. The first stop was Natal, in the northwestern corner of Brazil, marking the beginning of their journey on American soil. In South America, they traveled a considerable distance. Flying over the borders of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, they stopped at airports in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, and Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, before finally arriving in Santiago.
    From Beijing to Santiago, they spent a total of sixty-three and a half hours on the plane, nearly three days, not including layovers and rest stops. The total length of the route is approximately 22,000 kilometers.
    When they left Beijing in early August, it was the hottest time of the year in Beijing, and they would be covered in sweat with the slightest movement. Three days later, in Switzerland, it was early autumn weather like in Beijing, and they needed to wear jackets. The temperature changes were even greater from Switzerland to Santiago. After leaving Switzerland, it gradually warmed up. A dozen hours later, in Dakar, Africa, it was already a tropical region with hot and humid weather, and some people at the airport were wearing shorts and short-sleeved shirts. Fortunately, it was already evening, and the sea breeze blew gently, removing much of the heat. When crossing the Atlantic from Dakar to Natal, they passed through the equator. On the plane at high altitude, they could wear only single layers of clothing. Natal is closer to the equator than Dakar, but when they arrived it was late at night and it was raining, so it did not seem hotter than Dakar. As they traveled south from Brazil, the weather suddenly turned cold. In Buenos Aires, they needed to wear sweaters and coats, and the airport buildings were heated. Santiago and Buenos Aires are both in winter, but it is not very cold, and the climate is like autumn in Beijing. The seasons are reversed in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; it is summer in Beijing, and winter here.
    Chile is one of the important countries in South America. Its territory stretches like a narrow strip along the western edge of the South American continent. It is 4,400 kilometers long from north to south, and only 400 kilometers wide at most, and 70 kilometers at least. It faces the Pacific Ocean to the west and the towering Andes Mountains to the east. Flying west, approaching the border between Argentina and Chile, one can see this vast mountain range. The plane flew to a height of 4,800 meters, passing through a pass in the Andes Mountains. The weather was particularly good that day, with no clouds or fog, and strong sunlight illuminated the many snow-capped peaks on both sides of the plane. Aconcagua Peak, towering above the other peaks, could also be clearly seen from the plane. It is 7,150 meters high and is the highest peak in the Western Hemisphere. After the plane entered Chilean territory, it was in the airspace over the hinterland. After passing through the Andes Mountains, large areas of flat land appeared, which is the fertile Central Valley of Chile, the agricultural center, and further west along the coast there is also a coastal mountain range. Of Chile's total population of six million, 65% live in the hinterland composed of the Andes Mountains, the Central Valley, and the coastal mountain range. The population is particularly dense in the Central Valley. Northern Chile is a dry desert area, and some places do not receive a drop of rain all year round. This area contains copper and natural nitrate - Chile's two main exports. Southern Chile is a rainy forest area and island area, and the population is relatively sparse.
    Santiago is located in the Central Valley. From the city, you can see the snow-capped peaks of the Andes Mountains. It is the fourth largest city in South America and the political, economic, and cultural center of Chile, with a population of 1.3 million.
    When the plane carrying the art troupe arrived at the Santiago airport, hundreds of welcomers gathered there, waving flowers and applauding in waves. Some Chilean social celebrities, theatrical figures, and many well-known figures in the cultural and artistic circles came. Some Chilean friends who had visited China warmly embraced the leaders and members of the art troupe, exchanging cordial greetings and conversations. People said to us: "You have many friends in Chile." A drama student said: "We have been waiting to see Chinese drama for a very, very long time." The next day, Santiago newspapers published news and photos with considerable coverage, reporting on the arrival of the art troupe.
    The art troupe began performing at the Santiago Municipal Theater on August 20. In the past few days, the art troupe's performances have become a central topic of discussion for the citizens of Santiago. On trams and in public places, one can constantly hear conversations about this.
    Although the people of Chile and China are far apart, the bond of friendship will increasingly connect the people of the two countries more widely.

    到了最遥远的国度
　　万光
    中国艺术团在8月16日到达了智利首都圣地亚哥。无论从东走，还是从西走，智利都是距离中国最远的国家之一。中国的艺术家们从东半球来到了西半球，从北半球来到了南半球。智利而且是在西半球的南端。智利这个名称，按照印第安部落阿马拉人（Aymara）的文字的含意，就是“在地球的末端”。
    在过去几年里，为了交流文化，为了促进各国人民间的相互了解和友谊，新中国的艺术使者们到过亚洲、欧洲和非洲的不少国家。现在，又第一次来到了美洲的国家。
    这次，艺术团要向美洲国家公众介绍中国的京剧、民间舞蹈和歌曲，还有中国乐器演奏。京剧方面，在祖国享有声誉的李少春、张云溪、袁世海、杜近芳、云燕铭、张春华、李宗义等都来了。中国对外文化协会会长楚图南率领着这个艺术团，副团长是赵沨和王力。全团共有八十七人。
    艺术团8月初从北京出发，乘飞机绕过了大半个地球。从北京起飞，路过蒙古人民共和国、辽阔的苏联国土以及波兰上空，到达捷克斯洛伐克。从金色的布拉格继续起飞，穿过德国南部上空，到达瑞士。在这个有着世界公园之称的国家，艺术团逗留了几天。接着，又开始从瑞士到圣地亚哥的航程。越过法国南部、西班牙北部的上空，到葡萄牙首都里斯本的机场。从这里继续飞行，就透过云层看到大西洋的平静的洋面了。沿大西洋西部边缘飞行一段以后，进入沿海一片沙地的上空，这是非洲北部撒哈拉大沙漠的西部边缘。飞机在非洲东北部突出大西洋的一个交通站——法属西非的达喀尔（Dakar）稍事逗留后，横渡大西洋，到了南半球。第一站是在巴西西北角的纳塔尔（Natal）着陆，开始踏上美洲的土地。在南美洲，还经过了相当长的路程。飞过巴西、乌拉圭和阿根廷国境，先后在巴西首都里约热内卢和阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯机场停留，最后到了圣地亚哥。
    从北京到圣地亚哥，总共在飞机上呆了六十三小时半，将近三天。飞机中途停留和休息时间不算在内。航线全程约二万二千公里。
    8月初离开北京的时候，正是北京最热的时候，动一动就满身是汗。三天以后到瑞士，已是北京初秋气候，需要穿夹衣了。从瑞士到圣地亚哥，沿途气温变化更大。离开瑞士以后，就渐渐暖起来了。十几小时以后，到非洲的达喀尔，已是热带地区，天气闷热，机场上有些人员穿着短裤和短袖上衣。还好，当时已是傍晚，海风徐徐吹来，去除不少热气。从达喀尔到纳塔尔横渡大西洋时，穿过了赤道。在高空的飞机上一直可以穿着单衣。纳塔尔离赤道比达喀尔更近，然而到达时正是深夜，又下着雨，不显得比达喀尔更热。从巴西向南行，天气骤然冷起来。到布宜诺斯艾利斯，就需要穿毛衣和大衣，机场房屋里开放着暖气。圣地亚哥和布宜诺斯艾利斯一样，正是冬季，不过并不很冷，气候像北京的秋天。南北半球的季节正相反，北京是夏季，这里是冬天。
    智利是南美州的重要国家之一。它的国土像一条窄长的带子伸展在南美大陆的西部边缘。南北长达四千四百公里，东西宽最多只有四百公里，最少是七十多公里。它西面濒临太平洋，东部是高耸的安达斯山脉（Andes）地区。飞机向西行，接近阿根廷和智利边境时，就可以看到这个宽阔的山脉了。飞机飞到四千八百公尺的高度，穿过安达斯山脉的一条隘道上空。当时天气特别好，没有云雾，强烈的阳光照射着飞机两旁许多终年积雪的高峰。突出在其他高峰之上的阿康卡古阿（Aconcagua）峰，也可以从飞机上清楚地看到，它高达七千一百五十公尺，是西半球最高的山峰。飞机进入智利国境以后，是在腹地的上空。过安达斯山区以后，接连就出现大块平地，这是智利富饶的中央谷地，农业中心，再向西沿海又有一条沿海山脉。智利全国六百万人口中，65％是住在由安达斯山区、中央谷地、沿海山脉三部分构成的腹地。在中央谷地，人口特别密集。智利北部是干燥的沙漠地区，有些地方终年不下一滴雨。在这个地区蕴藏着铜和天然硝石——智利两种主要的输出品。智利南部是多雨森林地区和岛屿地区，人口也比较稀少。
    圣地亚哥就座落在中央谷地。从城里可以看到安第斯山脉的雪峰。它是南美第四大城，智利政治、经济和文化的中心。人口有一百三十万。
    艺术团所乘的飞机到达圣地亚哥机场时，几百个欢迎的人聚集在那里，摇动着鲜花，响起一阵又一阵的掌声。智利一些社会名流、戏剧及其他文化艺术界的许多知名人士都来了。一些曾经访问过中国的智利朋友同艺术团团长和团员们热情地拥抱。相互间亲切地问候和交谈。人们向我们说：“你们在智利有很多的朋友”。一个学习戏剧的大学生说：“我们等待看到中国的戏剧已经很久很久了”。第二天，圣地亚哥报纸都以相当篇幅刊载消息和照片，报道艺术团的到达。
    艺术团8月20日起在圣地亚哥的市立剧院演出。这几天，艺术团的演出已经成为圣地亚哥市民谈论的一个中心，在电车上，在公共场所，都不断可以听到这方面的谈话。
    智利和中国两国人民虽然相隔遥远，但是友谊的纽带将要把两国人民越来越广泛地联系在一起。
