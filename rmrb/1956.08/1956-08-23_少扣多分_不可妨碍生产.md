    "Less Deduction, More Distribution" Should Not Impede Production
    In the summer harvest pre-distribution, most agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province generally adhered to the principle of less deduction and more distribution, ensuring increased income for more than 90% of their members. However, a few cooperatives where income increases were not significant developed a tendency to unilaterally emphasize "less deduction and more distribution" without considering the cooperative's re-production needs.

    For example, the Xiangzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Haifeng County even distributed early-season seeds, planning to leave no seeds in reserve. Twelve primary cooperatives in Yuandun Township, Ninth District of Haifeng County, all increased production, but they decided to distribute all income without retaining any public accumulation funds or public welfare funds. In the Eighth District, agricultural production cooperatives that had already exceeded 18% of their total income in production investment uniformly reduced deductions to 18%, and the remainder was deferred to the late harvest calculation.

    The principle of "less deduction, more distribution" must be adhered to; however, it is wrong to disregard the needs of re-production and expanded re-production, to fail to deduct necessary production funds, or to fail to retain public accumulation and public welfare funds that should be retained. To achieve the goal of more distribution, less deduction is appropriate; but less deduction must not be understood as no deduction, or simply planning from the perspective of less deduction. To truly increase income, one must think of solutions from a proactive perspective. Distributing all income may make some members very happy; however, this happiness will not last long. Without production funds, can the next season's production be successful? Deferring the production funds that should be retained this season to the next season for deduction will only make the distribution work more difficult next season.

### “少扣多分”不可妨碍生产

    “少扣多分”不可妨碍生产
    广东省大部分农业社在夏收预分中大体上都坚持了少扣多分的原则，保证90％以上的社员增加收入。但是，少数收入增加不显著的社，却产生了片面强调“少扣多分”而不顾社的再生产的偏向。
    如海丰县香洲农业社把早造种子也拿来分配，准备不留种子。海丰县第九区园墩乡十二个初级社都增产了，但他们不留公积金和公益金，决定全部收入都分光。第八区的农业生产合作社，凡是生产投资已经超过总收入18％的，一律都压低为18％扣除，其余部分则推到晚造计算。
    “少扣多分”的原则是必须坚持的；但是，不顾再生产和扩大再生产的需要，必须扣的生产资金不扣，应该留的公积金、公益金不留，那就不对了。要达到多分的目的，少扣是应该的；但是决不可把少扣理解成不扣，或单纯从少扣方面打算盘。要真正做到增加收入，必须从积极方面想办法。把全部收入一律分光，可能使一些社员十分高兴；可是，这种高兴是不会长久的。没有生产资金，下一季的生产能搞好吗？把这一季应留下的生产资金推到下一季再扣除，那下一季的分配工作不就更难做了吗？
