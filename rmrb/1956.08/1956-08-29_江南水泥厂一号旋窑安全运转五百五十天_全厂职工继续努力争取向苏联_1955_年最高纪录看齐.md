(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 28th) The No. 1 rotary kiln of the joint state-private Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant has been operating safely for 550 days as of August 26th. This has set the highest national record for long-term safe operation of cement rotary kilns. This record greatly exceeds the previous national high of 367 days of safe operation achieved by the Guangzhou Cement Plant.

Long-term safe operation of cement rotary kilns is the decisive key to increasing cement production. The Jiangnan Cement Plant's No. 1 kiln increased cement production by 36,360 tons due to continuous operation for 550 days without major repairs, saving 110,000 yuan in repair costs and reducing costs by 190,000 yuan.

This achievement is the result of the entire workforce of the No. 1 rotary kiln diligently studying advanced experiences and working hard. They studied the complete set of experiences of the Guangzhou Cement Plant in long-term safe operation, absorbed the experience of rapid kiln rotation from the Hubei Huaxin Cement Plant, and earnestly studied and learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combining it with their own years of accumulated experience, thereby enabling them to handle various failures in operation in a timely manner. The biggest enemy of safe kiln operation is "ring formation." Team leader Liu Dongcheng, based on the principle of thermal expansion and contraction of objects, adopted a method of alternating high and low firing to effectively deal with ring formation. This experience was mastered by all the workers in the team, so that they were able to successfully overcome sixteen ring formation obstacles within 550 days. Secondly, minor repair ignition is also a key to safe operation. The workers of No. 1 kiln never relaxed their grasp of the situation inside the kiln during each minor repair ignition. They not only ensured the resumption of normal kiln operation after the most difficult minor repair ignition in June this year, but also successfully burned oil well cement five times (the temperature for burning oil well cement is higher than that of ordinary cement; failure to burn it would interrupt operation). Under the leadership and influence of team leader Liu Dongcheng, all the workers of No. 1 rotary kiln firmly established the idea of long-term safe operation. "Protecting our large kiln as we protect our own bodies" has become the common will of all the workers. Any movement on the No. 1 rotary kiln is connected to their breath. When a fault occurs, the workers cannot eat or sleep for it. Liu Dongcheng, who is over sixty years old and has rich experience, often sleeps without undressing and still works on the kiln in the middle of the night.

On August 26th, the entire plant was jubilant and encouraged by the new record created by the No. 1 rotary kiln. News of the achievement was posted everywhere from the factory gate to the workshops. On the afternoon of the 27th, the entire plant also held a grand and solemn celebration meeting.

Now the workers of No. 1 kiln have put forward a new guarantee in their letter of determination: to learn from the Soviet Volsky "Commune" Cement Plant, which created a 606-day safe operation record in 1955, to create a world record for safe operation, and to further overcome the shortcomings of the low hourly output of cement.

### 江南水泥厂一号旋窑安全运转五百五十天  全厂职工继续努力争取向苏联1955年最高纪录看齐

    江南水泥厂一号旋窑安全运转五百五十天
    全厂职工继续努力争取向苏联1955年最高纪录看齐
    本报南京28日电　公私合营南京江南水泥厂一号旋窑，到8月26日，已经安全运转五百五十天。创造了全国水泥旋窑长期安全运转的最高纪录。这个纪录大大超过了广州水泥厂安全运转三百六十七天的全国最高纪录。
    水泥旋窑的长期安全运转，是提高水泥产量的决定关键。江南水泥厂这次因持续五百五十天没有大修而增产的水泥就达三万六千三百六十吨，节省修理费用十一万元，降低成本十九万元。
    取得这个成就是一号旋窑全体工人认真学习先进经验与辛勤劳动的结果。他们学习了广州水泥厂长期安全运转的全套经验，吸收了湖北华新水泥厂快速转窑的经验，又认真研究和学习了苏联的先进经验，并和他们自己多年来积累的经验相结合，因而能够及时地处理运转中的各种故障。旋窑安全运转的最大劲敌就是“结圈”，组长刘东诚根据物体热胀冷缩的原理，采用烧大火和烧小火相配合的办法，有效地处理了结圈，这个经验为全班工人所掌握，因而在五百五十天内，能够顺利地克服了十六次结圈的障碍。其次小修点火也是安全运转的一关，一号窑工人们每次小修点火中一刻不放松对窑内情况的掌握，他们不但保证了今年六月最困难的一次小修点火后恢复旋窑正常运转，而且顺利地烧了五次油井水泥（油井水泥烧的温度比普通水泥高，烧不出来就会使运转中断）。一号旋窑的全体工人在组长刘东诚的领导和影响下，都牢固地树立了长期安全运转的思想，“要像保护我们身体一样的保护我们的大窑”，已成了全体工人的共同意志。一号旋窑上的任何动静，都和他们呼吸相通，一有故障，工人们就为它吃不下睡不着，六十多岁有着丰富经验的刘东诚，常常睡觉不脱衣，半夜还在窑上工作。
    8月26日全厂都为一号旋窑创造的新纪录而欢腾鼓舞，从厂门口一直到车间里，到处贴着贺喜的喜报。27日下午，全厂还特地开了一个盛大而隆重的庆祝大会。
    现在一号窑的工人们又在决心书上提出了新的保证：向在1955年创造六百零六天安全运转纪录的苏联沃尔斯基“公社”水泥厂学习，创造安全运转的世界纪录，进一步克服水泥单位小时产量不高的缺点。
