Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, August 21st: The U.S. Republican National Convention opened on August 20th at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. 1,323 Republican delegates from the 48 states and other areas of the United States, along with an equal number of alternate delegates, gathered in this hall, usually used as a livestock exhibition arena, to listen to grand campaign speeches from the party's upper echelons, elect the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates, and approve the party's campaign platform.

At the opening session, Washington State Governor Arthur Langlie delivered the "keynote speech," serving as a guiding principle for the Republican Party's future campaign activities.

Langlie adopted the same tactics used by the Republicans in the 1952 election, once again attacking the failures of the Truman administration's foreign policy. He blamed the expansion of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies after the war, as well as the setbacks of imperialist countries, on the Democratic Party. He accused the Democratic Party government of "abandoning China," "abandoning Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe," and "handing over vast areas of the world to Communist rule." He also accused the Democratic Party of "splitting Germany and Korea."

Langlie retorted to the attacks launched by the Democratic Party against the Republican Party at their convention in Chicago last week. He criticized the Democrats for being "corrupt and divided," and described the Democratic Party as a "union of hostile factions." The Democrats' twenty years in power ended with a "record of appalling mismanagement and corruption."

Langlie attacked the Democratic Party's use of the term "common people" to win over popular support, arguing that it would "promote class consciousness," while, according to him, the United States has never had an "upper class" and a "lower class," or a "ruling class" and "peasants."

Langlie said that due to these "sins" of the Democratic Party, allowing them to regain power would be a "national disaster."

Langlie portrayed the Republicans as "creators of peace, prosperity, and progress." He said that the Republicans brought an end to the Korean War, which had caused America "heavy casualties and enormous costs," and that the Republicans made America "militarily strong and diplomatically firm, without rattling sabers." Langlie praised Eisenhower's "achievements" and Dulles's "great diplomatic talents," but he did not mention a word about the so-called "containment," "massive retaliation," and "brinkmanship" policies that they had constantly advocated in the past four years.

The situation at the opening of the Republican National Convention indicated that Eisenhower's re-nomination as the Republican presidential candidate was a foregone conclusion. Therefore, the only issue that the various factions within the Republican Party needed to confront at the convention was the vice-presidential candidate. Currently, the forces within the Republican Party supporting Nixon as the vice-presidential candidate have gained the upper hand, but Stassen, who initiated the "Dump Nixon Movement," has stated that he will not abandon his support for Herter.

### 美国共和党大会开幕会的“主旨演说”  一面自吹自擂一面对民主党反唇相讥

    美国共和党大会开幕会的“主旨演说”
    一面自吹自擂一面对民主党反唇相讥
    据新华社21日讯　旧金山消息：美国共和党全国代表大会八月二十日在旧金山的牛宫开幕。来自美国四十八个州和其他一些地方的共和党一千三百二十三名代表和同等数目的候补代表聚集在这座通常用来作为牲畜展览场的大厅里，准备听取党的上层人物发表堂皇的竞选演说，推选共和党的总统和副总统候选人，并且批准党的竞选纲领。
    在开幕会议上，华盛顿州州长阿瑟·蓝利发表了“主旨演说”，作为共和党今后竞选活动的指导方针。
    蓝利沿用了共和党在1952年竞选中的手法，重新攻击杜鲁门政府外交政策的失败。他把战后苏联和人民民主国家的壮大以及帝国主义国家的挫败都算在民主党的账上。他指责民主党政府“放弃了中国”，“放弃了波兰和东欧其他国家”，“把世界广大地区送到共产党的统治之下”。他还指责民主党“使德国和朝鲜分裂”。
    蓝利对民主党上一周在芝加哥举行的代表大会上对共和党发出的攻击反唇相讥。他抨击民主党人“腐败和分裂”，民主党是“各敌对派系的联合”。民主党的二十年当政是以“惊人的管理不善和贪污的纪录”而结束的。
    蓝利抨击民主党为了笼络人心而提出的“平民”的说法，他认为这会“促进阶级感”，而据他说，美国从来没有“上层阶级”和“下层阶级”或者“统治阶级”和“农民”。
    蓝利说，由于民主党的这些“罪恶”，如果再让民主党重新当政，那就会是“国家的灾难”。
    蓝利把共和党人说成是“和平、繁荣和进步的缔造人”。他说，共和党人使美国“伤亡惨重、代价巨大”的朝鲜战争结束了，共和党使美国“在军事上强大、在外交上态度坚定，而又不敲战鼓”。蓝利称赞艾森豪威尔的“政绩”、杜勒斯的“伟大的外交才能”，他一个字也没有提到他们在过去四年中所不断鼓吹的所谓“遏制”、“大规模报复”和“战争边缘”的政策。
    共和党代表大会开幕时的形势表明，艾森豪威尔再一次出任共和党总统候选人已成定局。因此，共和党内部各派系在代表大会上需要摊牌的将只是副总统候选人问题。目前共和党内支持尼克松为副总统候选人的势力已占有优势，但是，发起“倒尼克松运动”的史塔生表示不放弃支持赫脱的主张。
