Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 8th: The "Opera Festival," which has been circulating in Tibet for more than 300 years, has begun in Lhasa. Yesterday, at Norbulingka, a famous scenic spot in Lhasa, thirteen folk troupes from all over Tibet performed many wonderful Tibetan opera programs.

    That morning, in Norbulingka, on a stage covered with an awning and surrounded by various potted landscapes, the sound of intense drums and cymbals rang out. Twelve actors from the Karma Shedra Troupe were the first to appear. Wearing masks of various shapes, they sang at the top of their voices and danced in a rhythmic circle. At this time, citizens and suburban farmers who had been waiting under the shade of the trees to watch the opera, rushed to surround the stage, and film photographers hurried over to point their cameras and capture these beautiful artistic images. Tibetan and Han responsible personnel from various departments of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, officers from the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and representatives from various agencies and organizations in Lhasa City attentively watched the performances under the tents on the north side of the stage.

    Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, also accepted the invitation of the Dalai Lama and watched the performance with the Dalai Lama in the palace surrounded by yellow gauze curtains.

    Yesterday, each troupe participating in the performance at Norbulingka took turns giving excellent performances, winning warm applause from the audience.

    Now, the Tibetan Plateau is experiencing a time of clear skies after a long rain, and a bumper harvest is in sight. People sing and perform operas to celebrate together and wish for a bumper harvest.

    After performing continuously for three days at Norbulingka in Lhasa, these thirteen troupes will tour major towns in Tibet.

    “唱戏节”在拉萨开始
    新华社拉萨8日电　在西藏流传了三百多年的“唱戏节”在拉萨开始了。昨天在拉萨著名风景区——罗布林卡里，来自西藏各地的十三个民间剧团表演了许多精采的藏戏节目。
    这天上午，在罗布林卡里罩着天幕、围绕着各色盆景的戏坛上，响起了激烈的鼓钵声，噶玛霞剧团的十二个演员首先出场，他们戴着各种形象的面具，引吭高歌，节奏分明地环舞着。这时，早就围坐在树荫下等待着看戏的市民和郊区农民，争先围拢戏坛，电影摄影记者们连忙赶过去对准镜头，拍摄这些优美的艺术形象。西藏自治区筹备委员会各部门的藏族和汉族负责人员、中国人民解放军西藏军区的军官和拉萨市各机关团体的代表们，在戏坛北边的帐幕下聚精会神地欣赏着。
    中共西藏工委副书记范明也应达赖喇嘛的邀请在围着黄色纱帐的宫殿里，和达赖喇嘛一起观赏了演出。
    昨天到罗布林卡参加演出的每个剧团轮番作了出色的表演，博得了观众热烈的喝采。
    现在，西藏高原正是久雨初晴，丰收在望的时候，人们演唱戏剧共相欢庆、预祝丰收。
    这十三个剧团在拉萨罗布林卡连续演出三天以后，将到西藏各主要城镇巡回演出。
