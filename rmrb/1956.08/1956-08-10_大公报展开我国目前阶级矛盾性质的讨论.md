*Dagongbao* Launches Discussion on the Nature of Current Class Contradictions in China

Is the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in China today antagonistic or non-antagonistic? This is a theoretical question with great practical significance. *Dagongbao* began a discussion on this issue on its first page on August 2nd.

From August 2nd to 4th, *Dagongbao* published a total of seven articles on this issue. Many people from industrial and commercial circles participated in the discussion, including Bi Mingqi, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Ni Jiaxi, Deputy General Manager of Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Yili Food Company, Chen Mingshan, General Manager of Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, and Pan Qinghua, Deputy Director of Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Gongjixing Tannery, among others.

In the course of the discussion, there were basically three different views. The first view was that the current contradiction has been transformed from an antagonistic contradiction to a non-antagonistic contradiction. The second view was that the current contradiction is still an antagonistic contradiction. The third view was that the current period is a transitional period from an antagonistic contradiction to a non-antagonistic contradiction.

Those who held the first view were Ni Jiaxi, Bi Mingqi, Lin Diffei, Wu Bingjun, and others. Their reasons were: the national bourgeoisie is willing to accept socialist transformation economically and politically; the socialist economic component is constantly growing, the capitalist economic component is constantly shrinking, the national bourgeoisie has recognized its future, is willing to accept socialist transformation, and is increasingly approaching the working class; the policy of peaceful transformation itself is not a form of struggle to resolve antagonistic contradictions. Lin Diffei also believed that contradictions are not immutable, and manifest themselves as contradictions of different natures in different historical periods. In the early stage of socialist transformation, the contradiction was antagonistic, and peaceful transformation was a special form of resolving class contradictions. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, this antagonistic contradiction began to transform into a non-antagonistic one. After the complete public-private joint venture of all industries, the antagonistic contradiction was basically resolved. The national bourgeoisie and the working class have a socialist consensus politically and ideologically. Therefore, the contradiction is non-antagonistic.

Chen Mingshan, Li Hao, and others held the second view. They believed that the contradiction is still antagonistic. The bourgeoisie can be peacefully transformed because of their special conditions. The contradiction between the exploiting class and the exploited class is antagonistic, and antagonism includes contradictions in thoughts and emotions. As long as capitalists exist, antagonistic contradictions will exist. Chen and Li concluded in their articles that the public-private joint venture did not eliminate the antagonistic contradiction, but only limited the antagonism to a certain extent. With the continued change in production relations, the degree of antagonism is gradually weakening. The realization of complete public-private joint ventures in all industries has fundamentally changed capitalist production relations, creating conditions of decisive significance for completely resolving this antagonistic contradiction.

Pan Qinghua held the third view. He believed that the current period is a transitional period in which the original antagonistic contradiction has basically developed into a non-antagonistic contradiction, so there are still antagonistic factors. His reasons are: after the complete public-private joint venture of all industries, the contradiction between the socialization of production and capitalist private ownership was basically resolved, but private ownership was not completely changed; exploitation still exists to a certain extent; the ideology of the bourgeoisie has not been completely changed; and the development of productive forces is still hindered to a certain extent. The method of resolving contradictions is determined by the historical relationship between the two classes, domestic and international conditions, and the attitude of the class to be eliminated. Therefore, China uses the method of peaceful transformation to resolve this contradiction based on these conditions. The remaining contradictions will be resolved with the development of objective conditions. (Ai Fan)

### 大公报展开我国目前阶级矛盾性质的讨论

    大公报展开我国目前阶级矛盾性质的讨论
    当前我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是对抗性的、还是非对抗性的？这是一个具有很大现实意义的理论问题。大公报已于八月二日起在第一版上展开了对这个问题的讨论。
    从八月二日到四日，大公报就这个问题共发表了七篇文章。有许多工商界人士参加了讨论，其中有天津市工商业联合会副主任委员毕鸣歧、北京公私合营义利食品公司副总经理倪家玺、上海公私合营信谊药厂总经理陈铭珊、北京公私合营公记兴制革厂副厂长潘庆华等。
    在讨论过程中基本上有三种不同的意见。第一种意见认为目前已由对抗性矛盾转化为非对抗性的矛盾。第二种意见认为目前还是对抗性的矛盾。第三种意见认为目前正是由对抗性的矛盾向非对抗性矛盾转化的过渡时期。
    持第一种意见的是倪家玺、毕鸣歧、林涤非、吴秉钧等。理由是：民族资产阶级在经济上、政治上都愿意接受社会主义改造；社会主义经济成分不断壮大、资本主义经济成分不断缩小，民族资产阶级已认清了自己的前途，愿意接受社会主义改造，越来越靠拢工人阶级；和平改造的政策本身就不是解决对抗性矛盾的斗争形式。林涤非并认为：矛盾不是一成不变的，在不同的历史时期，表现为不同性质的矛盾。社会主义改造初期，矛盾是对抗性的，和平改造是解决阶级矛盾的特殊形式。“五反”后，这个对抗性矛盾就开始向非对抗性转化，到全行业公私合营后，基本上已解决了对抗性矛盾。民族资产阶级和工人阶级在政治上、思想上有着社会主义的一致。所以矛盾是非对抗性的。
    陈铭珊、李皓等是持第二种看法的。他们认为矛盾仍是对抗性的。资产阶级可以和平改造是由于他们的特殊条件。剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的矛盾是对抗性的，对抗性包括思想情绪上的矛盾。资本家存在一天，对抗性矛盾就存在一天。陈、李两人在他们的文章中断定，公私合营后没有消灭对抗性矛盾，只是对抗性受到一定限制。随着生产关系的继续改变，对抗性程度在逐渐减弱。全行业公私合营的实现，资本主义生产关系发生了根本的变化，才给彻底解决这个对抗性矛盾创造了决定意义的条件。
    持第三种意见的是潘庆华。他认为，现在是由原来对抗性的矛盾基本上发展成为非对抗性的矛盾的过渡时期，所以还存在对抗性因素，他的理由是：全行业公私合营后，基本上解决了生产社会化和资本主义私有制的矛盾，但未完全改变私有制；剥削在一定程度上仍存在；资产阶级的思想还未彻底改变；生产力的发展也仍受到一定程度的阻碍。解决矛盾的方法是由两个阶级在历史上的关系、国内外条件、将被消灭的阶级的态度如何而定的。因此，我国是根据这些条件，用和平改造的方法来解决这个矛盾的。留下来的矛盾将随着客观条件的发展而得到解决。（艾蕃）
