The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, in order to improve the quality of local industrial products, increase product variety, and reduce production costs, recently held a prefecture-wide local industrial exhibition.

The exhibition was large in scale, with a total of sixteen exhibition halls for knitting, clothing, furniture, food, and other products, exhibiting 2,268 kinds of industrial products. The "Overview Hall" introduced the development of local industry in the autonomous prefecture from 1949 to the present. For example, taking 1949 as the base, the prefecture's production of consumer goods increased to 254.45% in 1955, and the number of product types increased to 221.4%.

The exhibits were rich in ethnic characteristics. The most interesting to visitors was the new product exhibition hall. It displayed 250 new types of industrial products, including beautiful leather bags and various sandals favored by the broad masses of Korean women, as well as various means of production. For example, the Yanji City Feed Factory and others successfully trial-produced fertilizers such as superphosphate of lime, lime nitrogen, and pesticides such as 666 powder, nicotine sulfate solution, and copper sulfate.

    本报讯　延边朝鲜族自治州人民委员会为了提高地方工业产品质量、增加产品花样、降低生产成本，最近举办了一次全州地方工业展览会。
    展览会的规模很大：共有针织、服装、家具、食品等十六个陈列馆，展览了二千二百六十八种工业产品。在“概况馆”里介绍了自治州地方工业从1949年到现在的发展情况。如以1949年为基数，1955年这个州消费资料生产提高到254.45％，产品种类增加到221.4％。
    展览品富有民族特点。最引起参观者兴趣的是新产品展览馆。这里面陈列了二百五十种新种类的工业产品，除了为广大朝鲜族妇女所爱用的美丽的皮包、各式凉鞋外，还有各种生产资料。如延吉市饲料厂等新试制成功的肥料过磷酸石灰、石灰窒素和农药六六六粉、硫酸尼古丁液、硫酸铜等。
