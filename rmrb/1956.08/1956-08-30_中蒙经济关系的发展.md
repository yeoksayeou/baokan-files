The negotiations between the Chinese government's economic delegation and the Mongolian government regarding economic aid to Mongolia have been successfully concluded. On August 29, the governments of the two countries signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic on Economic and Technical Assistance" in Ulaanbaatar. This agreement stipulates that the Chinese government will provide the government of the Mongolian People's Republic with free assistance of 160 million rubles over the four years from 1956 to 1959 to help Mongolia build projects such as a woolen textile factory, a paper mill, a thermal power plant, a glass factory, a brick and tile factory, a prefabricated wooden house factory, a vegetable farm, a sports field, a gymnasium, urban roads in Ulaanbaatar, suburban roads, and highway bridges. During the construction of these projects, China will provide various equipment and materials needed for construction and dispatch engineering and technical personnel and workers to Mongolia to conduct surveys, designs, and construction. At the same time, in order to help Mongolia train production and technical cadres, China will also accept Mongolian interns to conduct production internships in relevant enterprises in China.

The projects that China helps Mongolia build are determined according to the needs of Mongolia's national economic development. The construction of these projects is of certain significance for the development of Mongolia's national economy and the improvement of people's lives. After the wool textile factory built with China's help is completed, it will produce hundreds of thousands of meters of woolen fabrics every year. After the paper mill is completed, the various types of paper produced annually will provide an average of three to three and a half kilograms per person based on the Mongolian population. The brick and tile factory can produce enough bricks to build 120,000 square meters of houses each year, and the prefabricated wooden house factory can manufacture wooden houses for 700 households each year. The vegetable farm covers an area of ​​approximately 60,000 square meters and can grow various vegetables, and the vegetable storage capacity reaches more than 2,000 tons. The completion of the sports field and gymnasium will also be of great benefit to the Mongolian people who love sports. Other enterprises such as power plants and glass factories are indispensable for Mongolia to develop its national economy.

These projects that China is helping Mongolia build will begin this year and will be completed and put into production between 1957 and 1959. Now the first group of Chinese engineering and technical personnel has arrived in Mongolia and is about to begin surveying and designing for the construction of factories. In the future, a large number of engineering and technical personnel and workers will continue to go to Mongolia to help with construction. It is believed that in helping Mongolia with construction, they will surely display a high degree of internationalist spirit, contribute their strength, and work together with the Mongolian people to successfully complete this huge task.

The Mongolian People's Republic is China's close neighbor, and the Chinese and Mongolian people have a long tradition of friendship. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Mongolian relations entered a new stage of development. Economic cooperation between the two countries has been restored and developed accordingly. Since 1951, the two countries have begun to sign some trade contracts, and in 1953, a Sino-Mongolian trade agreement was signed, since then trade between the two countries has been on a normal track. In the past six years, trade between the two countries has greatly developed. The Sino-Mongolian trade volume in 1955 was three to four times that of 1951, and this year it will increase to two to three times that of last year, which is seven to eight times that of 1951. In the past few years, the Mongolian People's Republic has supplied China with a lot of materials, especially the horses that are currently very much needed for China's agricultural development. Up to now, it has reached more than 115,000 horses, which has a certain effect on China's agricultural production. Similarly, China has also supplied the Mongolian People's Republic with various daily necessities, silks and satins, grains, and equipment for match factories, porcelain factories, badge factories, button factories, fruit candy factories, and printing factories, which has played a certain role in Mongolia's economic construction and improving people's material lives. The signing of this agreement is a new development in Sino-Mongolian economic cooperation and has great significance for the continued development and consolidation of the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Mongolia.

    中蒙经济关系的发展
    高竞生
    我国政府经济代表团同蒙古政府进行的对蒙古经济援助谈判已经顺利结束，8月29日两国政府在乌兰巴托签订了“关于中华人民共和国给予蒙古人民共和国经济和技术援助的协定”。这个协定规定，我国政府在1956年到1959年的四年内将以一亿六千万卢布无偿地援助蒙古人民共和国政府，用来帮助蒙古建设毛纺织厂、造纸厂、火力发电厂、玻璃厂、砖瓦厂、木房屋预制厂、蔬菜农场、运动场、体育馆，乌兰巴托市市内道路以及市郊公路和公路桥梁等项目，在这些项目的建设中，我国将提供建设所需的各种设备和器材，并派遣工程技术人员和工人去蒙古进行勘查，设计和施工。同时，为了帮助蒙古培养生产技术干部，我国还将接受蒙古方面的实习生来我国有关企业进行生产实习。
    我国帮助蒙古建设的这些项目是根据蒙古国民经济发展的需要确定的。这些项目的建设对于蒙古国民经济的发展和人民生活的改善是有一定意义的。我国帮助蒙古建设的毛纺织厂建成后，每年将生产数十万公尺毛织品。造纸厂建成后，每年生产的各种纸张，按蒙古人口计算，每人平均可得到三公斤至三点五公斤。砖瓦厂每年生产的砖可修建十二万平方公尺的房屋，木结构房屋预制厂每年可制造出七百户人居住的木结构房屋。蔬菜农场的面积约六万平方公尺，可种植各种蔬菜，菜库的容量达二千多吨。运动场和体育馆建成后，对爱好体育运动的蒙古人民也有很大作用。其他如发电厂、玻璃厂等都是蒙古发展国民经济所不可缺少的企业。
    我国帮助蒙古建设的这些项目，从今年起就要开始进行，并分别在1957年到1959年期间建成和投入生产。现在我国第一批工程技术人员已经到达蒙古，即将开始进行建厂的勘查、设计工作。将来，还将有大批的工程技术人员和工人陆续前往蒙古帮助建设。相信他们在帮助蒙古建设中，一定会发挥高度的国际主义精神，贡献自己的力量，同蒙古人民一道，胜利完成这项巨大任务。
    蒙古人民共和国是我国的近邻，中蒙人民有着悠久的传统友谊。中华人民共和国成立后，中蒙关系进入了一个新的发展阶段。两国间的经济合作随之恢复和发展起来。自1951年起，两国就开始签订一些贸易合同，1953年签订了一个中蒙贸易协定，从此两国贸易已走上正常轨道。六年来，两国间的贸易有了很大的发展，1955年中蒙贸易额为1951年的三、四倍，而今年又将增为去年的二、三倍，为1951年的七、八倍。几年来，蒙古人民共和国供应了我国不少的物资，其中尤以目前我国农业发展十分需要的马匹为最多，到今年为止，共达十一万五千余匹，这对我国的农业生产有着一定的作用。同样，我国也以各种日用品、绸缎、粮食和火柴厂、瓷器厂、制徽章厂、钮扣厂、制水果糖厂、印刷厂等设备供给了蒙古人民共和国，对蒙古的经济建设和改善人民的物质生活也起了一定的作用。这次协定的签订，是中蒙经济合作关系的新的发展，对继续发展和巩固中蒙两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊有着重大的意义。
