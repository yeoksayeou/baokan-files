Is There Such a Thing as a "Benevolent" Hydrogen Bomb?

The whole world is demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb testing. From New Delhi, Tokyo, Moscow, Brioni to London and Paris, everywhere the call to stop hydrogen bomb tests is being issued.

This call is giving the United States, which is actively developing nuclear weapons and conducting hydrogen bomb tests, a headache. Thus, the argument that hydrogen bombs and hydrogen bomb tests are "humanitarian" has been manufactured without much effort.

According to the Associated Press, the Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Strauss, recently announced: "The current series of (hydrogen bomb) tests is of great significance not only from a military point of view, but also from a humanitarian point of view." According to him, the United States has discovered in its tests the possibility of reducing the range of radioactive particle dispersal.

According to this statement, the purpose of the United States in testing hydrogen bombs is not to increase their power, but to weaken their strength and influence as much as possible, which the whole world should naturally applaud. India and Japan should not be dissatisfied even if they are threatened by radioactive particles. Moreover, in this way, the hydrogen bomb becomes a "benevolent" weapon. Humanitarianism seems to be guaranteed as a result, and everyone can refrain from objecting if the United States uses hydrogen bombs.

If this is really the case, people can't help but ask: Why send rusty knives and guns to the battlefield?

When Mr. Strauss's high-sounding remarks reached Japan, a senior Japanese scientist, Dr. Mitani Takeya of Rikkyo University, immediately retorted that there is no such thing as a "benevolent" hydrogen bomb. He pointed out that the United States has not used any new weapons in its current tests to minimize the danger. He said that the amount of radioactive particles produced in recent U.S. tests is the same as during the 1954 tests.

Even the chairman of the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy couldn't help but express surprise, wondering "where Strauss's high-sounding remarks came from."

Even more intriguing is that while the United States is spreading the idea that hydrogen bombs are less dangerous, it is also loudly conducting a six-day nationwide exercise simulating a hydrogen bomb attack. Ten thousand officials fled Washington, D.C., and half of New York's eight million residents were assumed to have survived a hypothetical hydrogen bomb attack!

Clearly, Strauss's propaganda at this time that the United States has so-called "benevolent" hydrogen bombs is not only to ease the worldwide anger against U.S. hydrogen bomb tests, but also to paralyze the American people who oppose the U.S. government's war hysteria.

There is an old Chinese saying called "covering one's ears while stealing a bell." This was originally used to ridicule the extremely clumsy self-deceiving behavior of thieves. Unexpectedly, those in the United States who are very resourceful in the field of murderous weapons are actually masters at engaging in the trick of "covering one's ears while stealing a bell." The difference is that they want to cover the ears of the people of the whole world and steal the lives of the people of the whole world!

To such a great thief, one should shout loudly: It's time to lay down the butcher knife!

### 有所谓“仁慈”的氢弹吗？

    有所谓“仁慈”的氢弹吗？
    全世界都在要求停止氢弹爆炸的试验。从新德里、东京、莫斯科、布里俄尼以至伦敦和巴黎，到处都在发出停止氢弹试验的呼声。
    这种呼声使得正在积极发展核子武器和进行氢弹试验的美国感到头痛。于是氢弹和氢弹试验是“人道主义”的论调，就毫不费力地制造出来了。
    据美联社消息，美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯最近宣布：“目前的一系列的（氢弹）试验，不仅从军事方面来说，而且从人道主义方面来说，已经有了很重要的意义”。据他说，美国在试验中已经发现有可能缩小放射性微粒散布的范围。
    照这样说来，美国试验氢弹的目的，并不是在促进它的威力而是在尽量削弱它的力量和影响，全世界对此自然应该拍手赞成。印度和日本即使受到放射性微粒的威胁，也不应该有什么不满意。而且，这样一来，氢弹就成了“仁慈”的武器。人道主义似乎因此就有了保障，如果美国使用氢弹，大家也可以不用反对了。
    果真如此的话，人们可免不了要问：上锈的刀枪又何必送到战场？
    当斯特劳斯先生这番高论传到日本的时候，日本一位高级科学家——立教大学的武谷三男博士立即反驳说，根本不存在“仁慈”的氢弹这类东西。他指出，美国在目前的试验中并没有使用任何新武器来尽量缩小危险性。他说，最近美国的试验中产生的放射性微粒的数量同1954年试验期间一样。
    甚至于美国国会两院原子能联合委员会的主席，也忍不住表示惊异，不明白斯特劳斯的这番“高论从何而来”。
    更耐人寻味的是美国一方面散布氢弹减少了危险性的空气，一方面却大张旗鼓举行为时六天的全国规模的氢弹袭击的演习。一万名官员纷纷逃出华盛顿去，纽约的八百万居民被假定在氢弹袭击下只幸存一半！
    显然，斯特劳斯在这个时候宣传美国有了所谓“仁慈”的氢弹，不但是为了和缓全世界反对美国氢弹试验的怒潮，同时也是为了麻痹一下反对美国政府的战争歇斯底里的美国人民。
    中国有句老话叫做“掩耳盗铃”。这原是用来嘲笑笨拙透顶的自欺欺人的盗贼行径的。不料美国那些在杀人武器上面极会用心机的人，居然是干“掩耳盗铃”的勾当的能手。所不同的是他想要掩盖的是全世界人民的耳朵，想盗窃的是全世界人民的生命！
    对于这样的大盗，应该向他大喝一声：是放下屠刀的时候了！
