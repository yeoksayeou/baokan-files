Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: Floods from various rivers in North China have entered the Hebei Plain, and people along the rivers are doing everything they can to protect the dikes.

According to reports received yesterday by the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, the flood peaks of various rivers in North China have entered the river channels of the Hebei Plain from the upper reaches. Dozens of large and small rivers on the plain are experiencing very tense water conditions because they cannot discharge the extraordinarily large floods. Among them, the most tense situation is on the Zhang River, where the water level at Guantai in the upper reaches fell below the guaranteed water level at 8:00 AM yesterday, while the water levels at Chenggouwan and Linqing on the South Grand Canal have risen sharply. The floods from the five tributaries of the Fuyang River, which flows through the southern Hebei Plain, have overflowed into Daluze and Ningjinbo, and the water levels in Daluze and Ningjinbo are rising rapidly. There is a breach in the right bank of the Fuyang River, and the flood continues to flow eastward. The water level at Huangbizhuang on the Hutuo River, which runs across the central Hebei Plain, had fallen below the guaranteed water level at 8:00 AM yesterday, while Xian County in the middle reaches exceeded the guaranteed water level. After the northern and southern tributaries of the Daqing River breached their dikes in Li County, Zhuo County and other places, the flood peak entered Baiyangdian Lake yesterday, and the water level in the lake also exceeded the guaranteed water level. Due to rainfall in the mountainous gorges and the opening of the Guanting Reservoir to discharge water, a 50-meter section of the left bank dike in Daxing County in the lower reaches of the Yongding River also collapsed.

More than one million flood control personnel in Hebei Province are now making every effort to fight the floods. After the Zhang River and Fuyang River overflowed and breached their banks in Wei County, Linzhang and Ren County and other places, flood control workers in Handan and Xingtai regions actively protected the dikes and diverted the overflowing floodwaters, trying to minimize the flooded area. The people along the Hutuo River in Shijiazhuang region continuously built sub-dikes and counter-dikes to increase and strengthen the dikes, and actively diverted floods to the flood diversion areas of Raoyang and Anping. After the flood diversion, the hundreds of miles of the northern dike of the Hutuo River has been turned from danger to safety.

In the lower reaches of the rivers, 100,000 workers in Tianjin and Cangxian regions have built new 1-meter-high earthen embankments on the river dikes and are preparing to welcome the upcoming floods. In addition to promptly controlling the floodwaters that breached the dikes and entered the Wen'anwa Langouwa and other flood storage areas, the people of Baoding region are now making every effort to defend Baiyangdian Lake and the Daqing River dikes, and are actively preparing to divert floods to Wen'anwa. After a collapse occurred on the western Yadi dike on the left bank of the Yongding River in Daxing County, the responsible cadres of Tong County region immediately led 800 workers to carry out emergency repairs. Local troops also helped with the rescue efforts. Relevant central departments also urgently transferred grass bags and wire to provide support, which eased the dangerous situation.

From July 29th to August 4th, continuous heavy rains fell in the river basins of North China. According to the rainfall records of 49 hydrological stations in the nine major river systems of Hebei Province, the average rainfall in Hebei Province during the seven days was 180 millimeters. Due to the large amount of rainfall and the long rainy period, extraordinarily large flood peaks successively appeared in various water systems in North China starting on July 30th.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. Some areas of Hebei Province are taking emergency measures to rescue residents trapped by the floodwaters.

On the 5th, after some villages in Qingyuan, Gaoyang and other counties were surrounded by floodwaters, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately dispatched 100 wooden boats and a large number of rafts from Baiyangdian Lake, led by members of the Prefectural Committee, to rescue the villages surrounded by water. At the same time, the Commissioner's Office immediately allocated 150,000 yuan in relief funds to help the disaster victims solve their living difficulties. After 117 villages in Raoyang County, Shijiazhuang region, were flooded, the Raoyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately dispatched more than 100 county and district cadres, driving more than 200 boats to rescue the villages in distress. In Wei County, Handan region, due to the breach and overflow of the Zhang River, some flood control cadres and workers were trapped on the river dikes for more than two days without food. Handan region immediately dispatched 89 large boats to rescue them.

Many residents who were trapped by the floodwaters have now been rescued to safe areas and resettled. Cooked food, grain, and matches and other daily necessities have also been promptly sent to some villages where the flood disaster is not too serious.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Rainfall has continued for several days in the central region of Hebei Province, causing waterlogging and disasters, and many villages have been surrounded by water. At about 5:00 PM on the 7th, a transport plane from a unit of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army flew to the severely flooded areas of Boye and Suning on both sides of the Zhulong River in Hebei Province to airdrop a batch of life jackets to rescue farmers surrounded by floodwaters.

This agency's reporter Ren Jiaji accompanied the plane to the disaster area. The plane flew along the Beijing-Hankou railway line. After flying over Baoding and approaching Boye, the reporter clearly saw the flood caused by the typhoon-induced torrential rain overflowing the river dikes. Some villages on both sides were surrounded by accumulated water, and only the tops of the crops and trees in the fields were visible above the water. Some disaster victims whose houses were flooded temporarily moved to higher ground or lived on the roofs. In the 180-kilometer-long area from Beijing to Boye and Suning, the masses protecting the dikes patrolled back and forth on many unbreached waterproof dikes, continuing to fight the floods.

At 6:08, after circling between Boye and Suning for a while, the plane carried out an airdrop over some villages. From the plane, it was observed that rolls of life jackets all landed in the villages surrounded by floodwaters.

Today, the Civil Aviation Administration of China dispatched two transport planes from Baoding to also airdrop grain to these flooded areas.

    据新华社保定7日电　新华社记者张华报道：华北各河洪水已经进入河北平原，沿河人民正在全力抢护堤防。
    据河北省防汛指挥部昨日收到的报告，华北各河的洪峰，已由上游进入河北平原的河道，平原上的几十道大小河流，因承泄不下特大的洪水，水情都非常紧张。其中，最紧张的漳河昨日上午八时上游观台的水位已降到保证水位以下，南运河秤钩湾、临清等地的水位已经猛烈上涨。贯流冀南平原的滏阳河上游五条支流的洪水已宣泄漫溢入大陆泽和宁晋泊，大陆泽和宁晋泊水位正急剧上涨。滏阳河右堤有一处决口洪水继续东流。横穿冀中平原的滹沱河上游黄壁庄水位昨日八时已经降到保证水位以下，中游献县突破了保证水位。大清河南北两支流洪水在蠡县、涿县等地漫堤决口后，昨日洪峰已经进入白洋淀，淀内水位也超过保证水位。永定河下游因山峡降雨和官厅水库提闸放水，大兴县境一段左堤也发生五十公尺的塌堤险工。
    现在河北全省一百多万名防汛人员正尽最大努力和洪水搏斗。漳河、滏阳河在魏县、临漳和任县等地漫溢决堤后，邯郸、邢台专区的防汛民工就积极抢护堤防和疏导漫决洪水，尽量缩小水淹面积。石家庄专区滹沱河沿岸人民，连续修子埝筑戗堤增高加固堤防，和主动向饶阳、安平等泛区分洪。分洪后，数百里长的滹沱河北堤已转危为安。
    各河下游天津、沧县专区的十万民工，又在河堤上新筑了一公尺高的土埝，正在迎接即将到来的洪水。保定专区各县人民除及时控制出堤洪水进入文安洼兰沟洼等贮洪区外，现正全力固守白洋淀与大清河堤，并积极准备向文安洼分洪。永定河大兴县左岸西押堤发生塌堤险情后，通县专区负责干部立即领导八百民工抢护。当地驻军也帮助抢险。中央有关部门也急调草袋、铅丝支援，才使险情变缓。
    从七月二十九日到八月四日，华北各河流域连降暴雨。根据河北省九大河系四十九个水文站的雨量记录统计，在七天中河北全省平均降雨一百八十公厘。由于雨量大、雨期长，从七月三十日开始，华北各水系便相继连续出现特大洪峰。
    新华社保定7日电　河北省的一些地区正采取紧急措施抢救被大水围困的居民。
    五日，清苑、高阳等县有些村庄被洪水围困后，中共保定地委便立即从白洋淀调出一百只木船和大量的木筏，由地委委员领导到被水围困的村庄去抢救。同时专署立即拨出十五万元救济款帮助灾民解决生活困难。石家庄专区饶阳县一百一十七个村庄被淹后，中共饶阳县委立即派出一百多个县区干部，驾驶两百多只船到出险村庄抢救。邯郸专区魏县因漳水决口漫水，部分防汛干部和民工被困在河堤上两天多没饭吃，邯郸专区马上派出八十九只大船去抢救。
    现在许多被水围困的居民，已被抢救到安全地区，并进行了安置。对于某些水灾不太严重的村庄，也及时送去了熟食、粮食和火柴等生活必需品。
    新华社7日讯　河北省中部地区连日降雨，积水成灾，许多村庄被水围困。七日下午五时许，中国人民解放军空军某部派出一架运输机，飞往河北省潴龙河两岸博野、肃宁的重水灾区空投一批救生衣，营救被洪水包围的农民。
    本社记者任家骥随同飞机一起飞往灾区上空。飞机一直沿京汉线飞行。飞过保定，接近博野时，记者清楚地看到由台风引起的暴雨造成的洪水，溢出河堤，两岸部分村庄被积水包围，田野上的庄稼、树木被水淹得只露出梢头。有些房屋被淹的灾民，暂时移居在高处或住在屋顶上。从北京到博野、肃宁的一百八十公里长的地区内，许多未决口的防水堤上，护堤的群众来往巡查，继续和洪水搏斗。
    六时八分，飞机在博野、肃宁之间盘旋一阵后，就在一些村庄上空进行空投，从飞机上观察一卷卷的救生衣，都投中在被洪水包围的村庄里。
    今天，中国民用航空局派出两架运输机从保定向这些水灾区还空投了粮食。
