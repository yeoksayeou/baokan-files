Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The "1956-1967 Science and Technology Development Long-Range Plan (Draft)" has been initially drafted by scientists. The Science Planning Commission will convene an enlarged meeting in Beijing starting today to discuss and revise this plan (draft).

The scientists and representatives from relevant departments attending this enlarged meeting will spend about a week reviewing important issues such as the guiding principles for formulating the plan, the key areas of the plan, the system of scientific research work, the planning of scientific personnel, and research institutions. They will also discuss emergency measures for several important scientific and technological tasks in 1956 and major research tasks for 1957.

Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission, presided over the meeting. He said at today's meeting that the formulation of such a scientific development plan is a first in Chinese history. He expressed his hope that scientists would fully express their opinions and make this plan, which is related to socialist construction and the happiness of the people, more complete and perfect.

Nearly a thousand scientists from all over the country, under the leadership of the Science Planning Commission and with the assistance of Soviet scientists, began drafting this plan last December. They spent about seven months completing a draft of scientific planning documents consisting of several million words.

    出席这次扩大会议的科学家和有关部门的代表将用一周左右的时间，就制定规划纲要的方针、规划的重点、科学研究工作的体制、科学干部规划和研究机构等重要问题加以审定，并且将讨论1956年几项重要科学技术任务的紧急措施和1957年主要研究任务。
    国务院副总理、科学规划委员会主任陈毅主持这次会议。他在今天的会议上说，制定这样的科学发展规划，在中国历史上是第一次。他希望科学家们充分发表意见，把这个关系社会主义建设和人民幸福的规划编制得更加完善。
    来自全国各地的近千个科学家在科学规划委员会的领导和苏联科学家的协助下，从去年十二月开始编制这个规划。他们用七个月左右的时间，完成了几百万字的科学规划文件草稿。
