Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 5th: In order to ensure that more than 90% of agricultural cooperative members can increase their income, the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the heads of rural work departments of various localities (cities) and counties in late July to inspect the current production and distribution work of agricultural cooperatives.

The materials provided by the meeting show that the preliminary distribution results of this year's summer harvest in the province's agricultural cooperatives indicate that approximately 40% of the cooperatives cannot meet the requirement of guaranteeing increased income for more than 90% of their members. The main reason for not meeting this requirement is that since this spring, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have neglected the development of diversified economic activities. According to calculations, the income from diversified economic activities in the province from January to June this year decreased by about 60% compared to the same period last year.

After in-depth inspection and analysis, the meeting concluded that the reasons for the failure to develop diversified economic activities, in addition to the fact that the demands for agricultural production increase targets and capital construction by leaders at all levels were too high and too hasty, which affected the agricultural cooperatives in their business policies and led to a tendency towards uniformity, the main obstacles at present are first, the insufficient understanding of the importance of developing diversified economic activities by some cadres, who mistakenly believe that developing diversified economic activities is taking the capitalist road; some are afraid that engaging in sideline occupations will affect the completion of agricultural production tasks, etc. Among the commune members, in addition to fearing being labeled as "capitalist spontaneous forces" for engaging in household sideline occupations, they are also afraid that the cooperative will not give them time and that the money earned will be forced to be invested. Second, economic policies such as taxation and prices have not been adapted to the new situation in rural areas after the realization of advanced cooperation, and are still treating cooperative economy with policies that restrict urban and rural capitalism, resulting in restricting the development of diversified economic activities in rural areas; third, state-owned trade departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives have not closely cooperated in the development of diversified economic activities, and the production, supply, and sales of many products have not been properly resolved.

When inspecting the implementation of distribution policies in agricultural cooperatives in various places, the meeting found that this year, due to the lack of systematic experience in leading advanced cooperatives to conduct distribution by leaders and cadres at all levels, and coupled with the continuous rain during the wheat harvest this year, which increased the complexity of the wheat harvest distribution work, there are still many outstanding issues in the wheat harvest distribution work. These problems are: A considerable number of cooperatives first distribute grain according to the number of people, and then distribute the remaining part according to labor days, resulting in some commune members who worked more labor days not being able to receive the income they deserve in time; in disaster areas, cash crop areas, and some cooperatives where the grain consumption standard is set too high, the distribution is almost entirely based on the number of people, thus dampening the labor enthusiasm of the commune members; the phenomenon of some cooperatives setting the distribution ratio too high or too low is also very serious. In cooperatives where too much is deducted, the income of commune members is affected, and in cooperatives where too little is deducted, production is in difficulty. In addition, some cooperatives have not handled the processing and fertilization of wheat fields by the original elementary cooperatives or individual farmers before joining the cooperative in a mutually beneficial manner, and have not provided sufficient or reasonable care for "five guarantees" households and other households with special difficulties in life.

After comprehensively analyzing and inspecting the shortcomings and problems in the current production and distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various places, the meeting, after discussion, put forward measures and opinions, and proposed to launch a rectification movement in the cooperatives before the autumn harvest. This movement will focus on striving for an autumn harvest and developing diversified economic activities. Through checking and summarizing the summer harvest distribution, properly resolving the outstanding issues in the summer harvest distribution, implementing the model charter of advanced cooperatives, rectifying labor organization, promoting contracting work and output, and strengthening democratic management, in order to strive for increased income for more than 90% of commune members in the annual distribution, and further consolidate the agricultural cooperatives.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the meeting also studied the issue of improving the leadership style and work style of rural work cadres at all levels.

### 争取秋季丰收和发展多种经济  河南省委农村工作部检查当前生产提出保证社员增加收入的办法

    争取秋季丰收和发展多种经济
    河南省委农村工作部检查当前生产提出保证社员增加收入的办法
    新华社郑州5日电　为了争取农业社90％以上的社员能够增加收入，中共河南省委农村工作部在七月下旬召开了各地（市）、县委农村工作部部长会议，对农业社当前的生产和分配工作进行了检查。
    会议提供的材料表明：今年全省农业社的夏收预分结果，大约有40％多的社不能达到保证90％以上社员增加收入的要求。不能达到这个要求的主要原因，是由于自今春以来，绝大多数农业社都忽视了发展多种经济的工作。据计算，全省自今年一月到六月多种经济的收入约比去年同期减少了60％左右。
    经过深入检查和分析，会议认为：多种经济不能发展的原因，除了由于各级领导上对农业增产指标和基本建设的要求过高过急，影响农业社在经营方针上产生了单一化倾向以外，当前的主要阻碍首先是部分干部对发展多种经济的重要性认识不足，错误地认为发展多种经济就是走资本主义道路；有的怕搞副业影响了农业生产任务的完成等。在社员当中，除了怕搞家庭副业被扣“资本主义自发势力”的帽子以外，还怕社内不给时间和赚了钱被强迫投资。其次，在税收和价格等经济政策上，没有适应实现高级合作化后的农村新形势，进行相应地改变，至今仍然以限制城乡资本主义的政策来对待合作经济，结果，就限制了农村多种经济的发展；第三，国营贸易部门、供销社、手工业社和农业社在发展多种经济问题上没有密切地配合起来，许多产品的产、供、销问题没有得到适当解决。
    会议在检查各地农业社贯彻执行分配政策中的情况时，发现今年由于各级领导和干部缺乏领导高级社进行分配的系统经验，又加上今年麦收阴雨连绵，增加了麦收分配工作的复杂性，因而在麦收分配工作上目前还存在着不少的遗留问题。这些问题是：相当一部分社都先按人分配吃粮，然后再将剩余部分按劳动日分，结果便使一部分做劳动日多的社员不能及时分到应得的收益；在灾区、经济作物区和一部分扣留吃粮标准过高的社，几乎完全形成了按人分配，因而打击了社员的劳动积极性；部分社定分配比例偏高偏低的现象也很严重，扣得过多的社，社员的收入受了影响，扣得过少的社，又使生产发生了困难。此外，部分社对原初级社或个体户在未入社前向麦田内的加工施肥的处理没有做到互利，对“五保”户和其他生活特殊困难户也照顾的不够或者不很合理。
    会议在全面分析和检查了当前各地农业社在生产和分配工作中的缺点和问题以后，经过讨论，提出了措施和意见，并且提出要在秋收前开展一个整社运动。这个运动将以争取秋季丰收和发展多种经济为中心，通过检查总结夏收分配，妥善解决夏收分配中的遗留问题，贯彻高级社示范章程，整顿劳动组织，推行包工包产，加强民主管理，以便在全年分配中争取90％以上的社员增加收入，进一步巩固农业社。
    为了保证上项任务的完成，会议还研究了改进各级农村工作干部的领导作风和工作作风的问题。
