Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 10th: The Oriental Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lu'an County, Anhui Province, which was hit by a typhoon, fully demonstrated the indomitable spirit of "man will conquer nature" in the struggle against wind and rain disasters. According to statistics up to the 7th, the cooperative had drained 800 mu of accumulated water, supported seedlings in 400 mu of intermediate rice, replanted over 400 mu of late corn, and rushed to plant over 2,000 mu of late rice. Currently, over 3,200 cooperative members are still working hard every day to restore production after the disaster.

From August 1st to 3rd, the Oriental Agricultural Cooperative was hit by a strong typhoon, and mountain torrents erupted simultaneously, flooding many fields. During the two days of rainstorm, all cooperative members fought bravely against the wind and rain. The members used wooden basins, fish basins, wooden boats, water tanks and other tools to rescue all 26,000 jin of early rice and corn stored on the threshing ground, and transferred more than 20 cooperative member households whose houses were destroyed by the typhoon to safe areas, ensuring the safety of all people and livestock in the cooperative. Although all the cooperative members made great efforts to rescue, due to the particularly strong typhoon and the very fierce mountain torrents, the cooperative still suffered a great disaster. Over 2,700 mu of intermediate rice, corn and other crops were flooded and knocked down, and over 200 houses were damaged and collapsed. However, the cooperative members were not intimidated by this sudden natural disaster. As soon as the wind weakened, the cooperative immediately allocated part of its labor force and allocated a large amount of timber and straw stored in the cooperative to help the members repair more than 30 damaged houses, and mobilized members with surplus houses to lend more than 20 houses to properly settle 12 families of cooperative members whose houses had collapsed and had nowhere to live. The cooperative also pre-advanced 700,000 jin of new rice and 15,000 yuan in cash to help the members solve their living difficulties.

After the typhoon, all cooperative members were divided into three teams, and adopted methods such as rescuing flooded crops, rushing to plant late rice, replanting late autumn crops, and strengthening field management of existing crops, to strive for more grain harvest from multiple aspects to make up for the losses caused by the typhoon. On August 3rd, as soon as the wind and rain stopped, more than 200 cooperative members used bamboo poles in the flooded 800 mu of rice fields to push the rice ears on the water surface, washing away the water沫 and silt, so that the rice ears could grow normally. At the same time, the cooperative also organized more than 300 cooperative members and transferred 30 waterwheels to drain water and rescue intermediate rice. The rescued rice plants were promptly adopted with some methods such as turning over the rice plants and tying up the rice bundles to promote the continued growth of the rice plants. In order to save the loss of more than 500 mu of corn being knocked down and broken, the cooperative members used methods such as supporting the plants and wrapping the roots to rescue them. At the same time, the cooperative also prepared more than 2,000 jin of late corn and mung bean seeds, rushing to plant as the water receded.

    用集体力量战胜灾害
    东方农业社社员进行抢救和加强田间管理工作
    新华社合肥10日电　遭受台风袭击的安徽省六安县东方农业生产合作社，在同风雨灾害斗争中，充分表现了人定胜天的顽强精神。到七日止的统计，这个社已排除积水八百亩，有四百亩中稻扶了棵，复种晚玉米四百余亩，抢栽晚稻两千余亩。目前全社每天仍有三千二百多社员正在紧张地进行灾后的生产恢复工作。
    八月一日至三日，东方农业社受到强台风的袭击，同时山洪暴发，淹没了许多田地。在两天多的暴风雨中，全体社员与风雨进行英勇的斗争。社员们用木盆、鱼盆、木船、水缸等工具把所有稻场上堆存的二万六千斤早稻和玉米全部抢救出来，把房屋被台风刮毁的二十多户社员转移到安全地区，确保了全社人畜的安全。虽然经过全体社员的奋力抢救，但由于台风特别强大，山洪非常猛烈，这个社仍然遭受了很大灾害。全社被淹和被刮倒的中稻、玉米等农作物达二千七百余亩，损坏和倒塌的房屋二百余间。但是社员们并没有被这突然的自然灾害吓倒。当风力刚刚减弱以后，社内随即调配了部分劳动力，拨出社内积存的大批木材、稻草，协助社员修补了三十多间被损毁的房屋，并动员有多余房屋的社员借让出二十多间房屋，妥善安置了十二家房屋倒塌无处安居的社员。社里又提前预支新稻七十万斤，现款一万五千元，帮助社员解决生活困难。
    台风过后，全体社员分成了三套班子，采取抢救水淹作物、抢栽晚稻、复种晚秋作物和加强现有作物的田间管理等办法，从多方面争取多收粮食，弥补台风所造成的损失。在八月三日风雨刚停，全社就有二百多社员在被淹的八百多亩稻田内用竹竿推动水面的稻穗，将稻穗上的水沫、淤泥洗净，使稻穗能正常成长。同时，全社又组织三百多社员，抽调水车三十部进行排水抢救中稻。已救出的稻棵，都及时采用一些翻稻棵、扎稻把等办法，促使稻棵继续生长。为了挽救五百多亩玉米被刮倒、打断的损失，社员们采用扶棵、包根等办法进行抢救。同时全社还准备了二千多斤晚玉米和绿豆种，赶着水退，随退随种。
