    More Vigilantly Defend the Motherland's Borders
    The news of Shandong Province's successive capture of two batches of American spies once again uses irrefutable facts to tell the Chinese people that vigilance against the conspiracies of American imperialism must not be relaxed at any time. Judging from the tasks accepted by these special agents and spies, the subversive activities of American imperialism against our country have not weakened with the easing of the international situation. The tasks of these special agents upon landing are, on the one hand, to collect information on our country's military, political, and economic aspects, and on the other hand, to collect various migration certificates, membership cards, etc., to understand the procedures for handling these documents. The purpose is to enable American intelligence agencies to send spies and special agents to the mainland of our country on a larger scale.
  　Recently, American intelligence agencies have not only been dispatching spies and special agents to the mainland of our country from the coastal areas of Fujian, near Taiwan, to carry out sabotage activities, but have also been painstakingly dispatching spies and special agents to the northern coastal areas, southern coastal areas, and southwestern border areas of our country. Before landing in Haiyang, Shandong, these spies and special agents were escorted five times by speedboats dispatched by the American spy organization "Central Intelligence Agency" in an attempt to land in the northeastern and Shandong coastal areas of our country, but without success, finally landing in the Haiyang coastal area.
    After the overall international situation had eased, some representatives of warmongering forces in the American ruling group disliked this easing. On the one hand, they tried their best to provoke the friendly relations between our country and neighboring countries and create a tense atmosphere; on the other hand, they tried their best to carry out sabotage from within our country. In July of this year, the US Senate passed a bill to add 25 million US dollars to the special agent fund in order to strengthen espionage activities against socialist countries.
    While American imperialism is carrying out these activities, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is also actively dispatching a large number of special agents to the mainland to carry out sabotage activities, thereby creating an impression of so-called unstable order on the mainland of our country internationally.
    In response to this situation, the people of our country must continue to maintain due vigilance against the activities of US-Chiang's dispatch of spies and special agents, and must not relax. Party and government workers and the masses in coastal and border provinces should not forget the environment they are in and the special responsibilities they bear when carrying out various tasks.
    The People's Liberation Army's coastal defense and border defense forces, as well as public security organs in coastal areas, should continue to unite and rely on the people to capture any US-Chiang spies who dare to land, smash the heinous conspiracy of American imperialism to send special agents to us, and more vigilantly defend the motherland's borders.

### 更警惕地保卫祖国边境

    更警惕地保卫祖国边境
    山东省连续捕获两批美国间谋的消息，又一次用确凿的事实告诉我国人民，对于美国帝国主义的阴谋是任何时候都不能放松警惕的。从这些特务间谍分子所接受的任务来看，美国帝国主义对于我国的阴谋破坏活动，并没有随着国际形势的缓和而减弱。这些特务登陆的任务，一方面是搜集我国的军事、政治和经济等各方面的情报，另一方面就是要搜集各种迁移证、会员证等等，了解办理证件的手续，目的是使美国间谍机关能够更大规模地派遣间谍特务分子到我国大陆上来。
  　最近时期，美国特务机关不但在靠近台湾的福建沿海向我国大陆派遣间谍特务，进行破坏活动，而且还费尽心机在我国北方沿海地区、南方沿海地区以及西南边疆地区派遣间谍特务。在山东海阳登陆的这些间谍特务，在登陆以前，美国间谍组织“中央情报局”曾经五次派出快艇护送他们，企图在我国东北和山东沿海登陆，但都没有成功，最后才在海阳沿海登陆。
    在整个国际形势有了缓和以后，美国统治集团中有一部分代表好战势力的人物不喜欢这种和缓。他们一方面竭力挑拨我国和邻国的友好关系，制造紧张空气；一方面就竭力企图从我国内部实行破坏。今年七月间，美国参议院通过追加两千五百万元特务经费的议案，就是为了加强对社会主义阵营各国进行间谍活动的。
    在美国帝国主义进行这些活动的同时，蒋介石集团也积极地派遣大批特务到大陆上来，进行破坏活动，并以此在国际上制造一种所谓我国大陆秩序不稳定的印象。
    针对这种情况，我国人民必须对美蒋派遣间谍特务的活动继续保持应有的警惕，不能松懈。沿海和边疆各省的党政工作人员和人民群众，在进行各种工作时都不应当忘记自己所处的环境，和自己所担负的特殊责任。
    人民解放军海防和边防部队以及沿海地区的公安机关，应该继续团结和依靠人民群众，捕捉任何敢于登陆的美蒋间谍，粉碎美国帝国主义向我们派遣特务的罪恶阴谋，更加警惕地保卫祖国边境。
