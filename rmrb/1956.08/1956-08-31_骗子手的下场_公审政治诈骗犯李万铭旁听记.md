The End of a Swindler
——Attending the Public Trial of Political Fraudster Li Wanming
By Our Reporter

Yesterday, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court publicly tried political fraudster Li Wanming. At 9:15, bailiffs brought Li Wanming into the courtroom. The more than one thousand cadres from government organizations, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and workers in the audience all glared at this political swindler who had once infiltrated the internal workings of government. Li Wanming had originally intended to use forged letters and credentials to fraudulently obtain honor and position, but today he received the people's punishment.

The state prosecutor – Zhao Yuanxin, prosecutor of the Beijing People's Procuratorate – read out the Beijing People's Procuratorate's indictment in court. Presiding Judge Li Farong and People's Assessors Liu Tiehua and Yang Jinrong verified Li Wanming's criminal facts, one by one, based on the prosecutor's accusations.

A witness – Zhou Zidu, an elderly man in his sixties who writes letters for people on Chongnei Street – was once tricked by Li Wanming into copying forged telegrams and letters under the pretext of introducing him to work. Today, he appeared in court to testify. When he walked in front of the criminal Li Wanming, he scrutinized him for a long time before answering the presiding judge: "This person's appearance resembles Wang Wanmin (a false name made up by Li Wanming), who wore a military uniform and asked me to help him copy telegrams and letters at my home on the evening of November 26, 1954; he also stuttered, just like him." Because the criminal came to his home at night, he could not be sure whether Li Wanming was Wang Wanmin. But when he saw with his own eyes the telegrams and letters he had copied himself, he was certain, and with a look of regret, he described in detail how the criminal Li Wanming asked him to copy telegrams and letters.

So, the presiding judge asked the criminal Li Wanming: "Do you know him?"
"Yes, I know him."
"Are the facts he talked about correct?"
"Correct."

Whenever the presiding judge questioned an important detail, he would always open those huge volumes of supporting materials. After the assessors read them aloud, they handed them to the criminal Li Wanming one by one. Faced with the irrefutable evidence, the criminal admitted his crimes one by one.

Subsequently, the presiding judge asked the prosecutor and the defense lawyer to question the defendant Li Wanming.

"Have you ever served in the People's Liberation Army?"
"No."
"Did you get your stutter from poisoning on the Korean battlefield?"
"No."
"Do you have any gunshot wounds on your body?"
"No."

However, this political fraudster once pretended to be a veteran Red Army soldier who joined the revolution early, a meritorious person of the people, a heroic combat hero of the Volunteer Army who fought bravely on the Korean battlefield, was wounded five times, and repeatedly performed outstanding deeds! He relied on these fabricated experiences to gain trust and honor, mixed into our state organs, infiltrated the Communist Party, and usurped important positions. Now, let's see how the criminal Li Wanming answered the lawyer's questions.

"What was your purpose in forging documents and impersonating a cadre, a model Communist Party member, and a combat hero?"
"For the shameful so-called sense of honor, status, and material enjoyment."
"Why did you impersonate a Communist Party member, a disabled soldier, and a Volunteer Army combat hero?"
"Whatever is the most glorious, the most honorable, and the most admired, I would impersonate that."
"The fraudulent methods and means you adopted are not clever, and there are many loopholes. Aren't you afraid of being discovered?"
"After a person does bad things once or twice, and then many times in a row without being discovered, they become complacent."

This sentence vividly exposed the ugly face of a swindler.

Then, the presiding judge announced that the factual investigation was over and began the debate.

Prosecutor Zhao Yuanxin presented the indictment. He summarized the process of Li Wanming's fraud and pointed out that the defendant Li Wanming's fraudulent activities had caused serious harm to the country. Therefore, Prosecutor Zhao Yuanxin, in his capacity as a state prosecutor, requested the presiding judge and assessors to sentence the criminal to the criminal punishment he deserved in accordance with the law. However, he also pointed out that the defendant Li Wanming was able to confess after being arrested, and hoped that the court would take this into consideration when determining the sentence.

Then, the defendant's entrusted lawyers, Fan Ming and Ma Rongjie, successively presented defenses based on the prosecutor's indictment. Fan Ming is the acting director of the Criminal Law Teaching and Research Office of Peking University. In his capacity as a lawyer, he proposed that the nature of the defendant's crime should be determined. Because political fraud can be understood in different ways. If political fraud refers to Li Wanming's use of political activity as a means of fraud and causing political damage to the country, he has no objection; however, political fraud can also be understood as having political motives and engaging in political sabotage activities, but based on the facts of the defendant's crime, the defendant's purpose in engaging in criminal activities was to pursue enjoyment and reputation, and he did not engage in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Lawyer Fan Ming also pointed out that the serious losses and harms caused by Li Wanming to the Party and the country should first of all be borne entirely by the defendant; however, the麻痹 ideas of some of our staff members, the lax personnel system of some government organizations, and carelessness in work also gave the defendant an opportunity to engage in criminal activities. Therefore, when convicting him, the harm to the country cannot be entirely placed on the defendant.

The nature of the crime caused a heated debate in court. Prosecutor Zhao Yuanxin stated that, according to the investigation, Li Wanming's criminal purpose was to seek personal fame and fortune, and no counter-revolutionary behavior has been found. Therefore, in the indictment, he was convicted of political fraud, not counter-revolution. However, because it can be seen from the facts of the defendant's crime that the defendant privately carved official seals, forged seals, impersonated a meritorious person of the people, disrupted national order, and harmed national construction, his criminal nature belongs to political fraud, which is accurate.

As for criminal responsibility, although there are objective reasons, Prosecutor Zhao Yuanxin very clearly pointed out: Li Wanming's crime is the sole responsibility of Li Wanming; for example, if a thief steals someone else's money, the thief should of course be responsible, and not the person who lost the money. Objective reasons cannot excuse or mitigate Li Wanming's criminal responsibility.

Lawyer Ma Rongjie, based on the prosecutor's statement, continued to speak on the nature and harmful consequences of the crime, as well as the defendant's reporting of counter-revolutionary elements, hoping that the judges would consider this when determining the sentence.

Prosecutor Zhao Yuanxin further cited facts to illustrate that the political swindler Li Wanming's fraud was all-pervasive. Take his stutter as an example, he once deceived people by saying that it was caused by throat poisoning in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. It was only during the investigation that he admitted that his stutter was a physiological defect.

After a heated debate, the presiding judge finally asked the defendant if he had anything else to say. Li Wanming once again admitted his criminal behavior and requested leniency.

At this point, the debate ended, and the presiding judge announced a recess. After deliberation by the presiding judge and the people's assessors, the court continued. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court, based on Li Wanming's crimes, announced that Li Wanming was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.

After the verdict, the reporter interviewed People's Assessor Liu Tiehua and Zhang Tianmin, director of the Personnel Department of the Central Forestry Industry Department, who attended the hearing. After participating in this assessment, Liu Tiehua deeply felt that in today's world, in our country, no matter how great a criminal's tricks are, they will ultimately not escape the people's justice! Zhang Tianmin believes that the fact that this political swindler has been deceiving all the way to our high-level government organizations without being discovered earlier is a great lesson that should arouse our vigilance.

    骗子手的下场
    ——公审政治诈骗犯李万铭旁听记
    本报记者
    昨天，北京市中级人民法院公开审判政治诈骗犯李万铭。九时一刻，法警把李万铭带上法庭，旁听席上的一千多名机关干部、人民解放军、工人，都举目怒视这个曾经混入机关内部的政治骗子。李万铭原想用伪造各种信件和证明文件来骗得荣誉、地位，但是，今天他得到了人民的惩罚。
    国家公诉人——北京市人民检察院检察员赵元信在法庭上宣读了北京市人民检察院起诉书；审判长栗发荣和人民陪审员刘铁华、杨金荣，根据检察员的控诉，逐条查证李万铭的犯罪事实。
    证人——在崇内大街代写书信的周谘度，是一个六十多岁的老人；李万铭以介绍工作为借口，曾经骗他抄写伪造的电报和信件。今天，他出庭来作证。当他走到罪犯李万铭的面前的时候，细细端详了很久，才回答审判长说：“这个人的面貌像1954年11月26日晚到我家要我帮他抄电报、信件的穿军装的王万敏（这是李万铭造的假名）；说话口吃，也跟他一样。”罪犯是晚上到他家去的，李万铭是不是王万敏，他还不能肯定。但是当他亲眼看到他自己经手抄写的电报和信件的时候，他肯定了，而且他带着悔恨的神情，详细陈述了罪犯李万铭找他抄写电报、信件的经过。
    于是，审判长问罪犯李万铭：“你认识他吗？”“认识。”
    “他谈的事实对吗？”
    “对。”
    审判长每审问到重要情节，总翻开那一大本一大本的证明材料。陪审员宣读以后，一个个地拿给罪犯李万铭看。在铁证面前，罪犯一一承认了自己的罪行。
    随后，审判长请检察员和辩护律师向被告李万铭提出询问。
    “你当过人民解放军吗？”
    “没有。”
    “你的口吃是在朝鲜战场上中毒得的吗？”
    “不是。”
    “身上有无枪伤？”
    “没有。”
    可是，这个政治诈骗犯却曾冒充他是早年参加革命的老红军、人民功臣，在朝鲜战场英勇作战、五次负伤而屡建奇功的志愿军战斗英雄！他就靠着这些捏造的经历而骗得了信任和荣誉，混进了我们国家机关，钻进了共产党内，窃据了重要的职位。现在，再看看罪犯李万铭又是怎样回答律师的问题。
    “你假造证件，冒充干部、模范共产党员、战斗英雄，为了什么目的呢？”
    “为了可耻的所谓荣誉感、地位和物质享受。”
    “为什么要冒充共产党员、残废军人、志愿军战斗英雄？”
    “什么事情是最光荣、最荣誉、使人最钦佩的，我就冒充什么。”
    “你采取的诈骗方式和手段，并不高明，而且有许多漏洞，不怕被人发觉吗？”
    “一个人做坏事，一次两次、接连许多次没有被人发觉以后，就会得意忘形。”
    这句话活生生地暴露了一个骗子手丑恶的嘴脸。
    然后，审判长宣布事实调查结束，开始辩论。
    检察员赵元信提出公诉词。他概括地叙述了李万铭进行诈骗的经过，提出被告李万铭的诈骗活动，给国家带来了严重的危害。因此，检察员赵元信以国家公诉人的身份，要求审判长、陪审员依法判处这个罪犯以应得的刑事处分。不过，他又指出：被告李万铭在被捕以后，还能坦白，希望法庭在量刑的时候加以考虑。
    接着被告委托的律师范明和马荣杰根据检察员的公诉词相继提出辩护。范明是北京大学刑法教研室的代理主任。他以律师身份提出被告的犯罪性质要加以确定。因为政治诈骗可有不同的理解。如果说政治诈骗是指李万铭进行诈骗利用了政治活动的手段、给国家造成了政治损害，他没有意见；但是，政治诈骗也可以被人理解为有政治目的，进行政治破坏活动，但从被告犯罪的事实中看，被告进行犯罪活动的目的，是追求享受和名誉，并没有进行反革命破坏活动。
    范明律师又提出，李万铭给党和国家造成的严重损失和危害，首先应该由被告负完全责任；但是我们某些工作人员的麻痹思想，某些机关的人事制度不严，工作中的粗枝大叶，也使被告的犯罪活动有了可乘之机。因此，在判罪的时候，不能把对国家的危害完全放在被告身上。
    关于犯罪性质，在法庭上引起了热烈的辩论。检察员赵元信谈到，根据侦讯判明，李万铭犯罪目的是为了贪图个人名利，还没有发现反革命行为，因此在起诉书中是以政治诈骗论罪，而不是以反革命论罪。但是因为从被告的犯罪事实中可以看到被告私刻公章、伪造印信，冒充人民功臣，破坏了国家秩序，危害了国家建设事业，因此，他的犯罪性质属于政治诈骗，是确切的。
    至于犯罪责任，虽有客观原因，但检察员赵元信非常明确地指出：李万铭犯罪，责任只有李万铭负；譬如一个小偷偷了别人的钱，当然应该由小偷负责，而不能由丢了钱的人负责。客观原因不能推卸或减轻李万铭的犯罪责任。
    律师马荣杰根据检察员的发言，继续对犯罪性质和危害后果，以及被告检举反革命分子等问题发言，希望审判员在量刑的时候考虑。
    检察员赵元信又列举了事实来说明李万铭这个政治骗子进行诈骗是无孔不入的。就拿他的口吃为例，他曾经骗人说是在抗美援朝战争中喉咙中毒所造成，在调查时，他才承认他的口吃是生理缺陷。
    经过热烈的辩论以后，最后审判长问被告还有什么说的？李万铭再次承认了自己的犯罪行为，而且提出请求从宽处理。
    至此，辩论终结，审判长宣告退庭休息。经审判长和人民陪审员评议后，继续开庭。北京市中级人民法院根据李万铭的罪行，宣布判处李万铭徒刑十五年。
    判决以后，记者访问了人民陪审员刘铁华和旁听的中央森林工业部人事司的处长张天民。参加这次陪审以后，刘铁华深深感到，在今天，在我们国家，任何犯罪分子，不管他有多大的骗术，终久是逃不出人民的法网的！张天民认为，这个政治骗子一直骗到我们的高级机关，没有及早发觉，这是一个很大的教训，应当引起我们的警惕。（附图片）
