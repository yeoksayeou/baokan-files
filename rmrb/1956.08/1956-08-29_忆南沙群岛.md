    Remembering the Nansha Islands
    Ju Jiwu
    Ten years ago, I visited the southernmost part of our motherland – the Nansha Islands.
    When the northern seas of the mainland were still drifting with ice floes, the "Big Spring Sea" fishing season (January to May) in the Nansha Islands had already begun. Hundreds upon hundreds of fishing boats, with sails full of wind, set out on the green, vast South China Sea towards the southernmost group of islands of our motherland - the Nansha Islands, forming a magnificent scene.
    The Nansha Islands are composed of many coral islands that emerge from the sea and coral reefs that are submerged. They are scattered over a wide area, with the southernmost point close to Indonesia, the easternmost point close to the Philippines, and the westernmost point not far from Vietnam. They are all small in size, with the largest, Taiping Island, being only 1.7 square kilometers. The next largest are Zhongye Island, Nanwei Island, Beizi Island, and Nanzi Island, among others.
    On Taiping Island, I met many South China Sea fishermen, this is where they most often stay. In the eastern part of Taiping Island, there are houses built by our fishermen. In the middle of the island, there is a large road running east-west through the forest. There is also a stone tablet erected by us on the island, inscribed with the seven large characters "Nansha Islands Taiping Island". The island is surrounded by coral reefs submerged in the water; in fact, the island is located on a large coral reef plate. At low tide, most of the reef plate is exposed, and it is possible to wade across, but the jagged coral makes walking difficult. At high tide, the reef plate is submerged, and fishing boats and small boats can directly approach the shore.
    Navigating southwest from Taiping Island, you arrive at Nanwei Island. Nanwei Island is a place passed by ships traveling from Singapore to Manila and Hong Kong. To its northeast, there is a waterway about fourteen meters deep, allowing ships to dock directly, which further increases its importance in marine transportation.
    The Nansha Islands are located in the tropical ocean between 11.5 degrees north latitude and 4 degrees north latitude. The climate is also tropical oceanic. Even in the coldest months of the year (December and January), the temperature is above 26 degrees Celsius. Due to the regulation of the ocean, the temperature is not too high even in the hottest months of July and August. There is not much difference within a day or throughout the year. It can be said that there is a long summer without winter, and there are no distinct seasons. As for rainfall, it is also very abundant, averaging over 1,000 millimeters per year, and evenly distributed throughout the months.
    Due to the year-round high temperature and abundant rainfall, these islands are covered with dense, evergreen broad-leaved forests. There are towering coconut groves, huge papaya trees, jackfruit trees, and horn bananas, etc. They all bloom with beautiful flowers and bear delicious fruits all year round. The undergrowth is also full of lush grass and wildflowers, evergreen all year round, never withering.
    The coasts of these islands are beaches washed by the ebb and flow of waves and tides, like a pure white jade belt, becoming a natural dividing line between the green islands and the green ocean.
    The Nansha Islands produce abundant and highly economically valuable aquatic products. Algae plants such as agar, kelp, seaweed, and laver grow around the islands, and animals such as sea cucumbers, conch oysters, and hawksbill turtles inhabit them. These plants and animals attract their patrons: skipjack tuna, tuna, sailfish, red fish, sharks, and other fish come to forage and spawn, thus becoming an important deep-sea fishing ground for our country in the South China Sea. These fish also attract their patrons – boobies – to forage and spawn, thus becoming an important guano producing area for our country in the South China Sea.
    Agar can be used to make agar-agar, which is a delicious food and a culture medium for medicine and biological research. Kelp and laver can be used to extract iodine, potassium and other chemical medicines needed in medicine and industry. Seaweed can be used to extract santonin, which is a specific drug for expelling roundworms. Various types of fish can be made into dried fish and canned food, fish liver oil can be extracted, and fish bones can also be made into fertilizer powder. Guano contains a large amount of phosphorus, organic matter, and a small amount of nitrogen and potassium, and is a raw material for manufacturing fertilizer powder and caffeine. These products are all invaluable natural resources that we can draw upon inexhaustibly.

    忆南沙群岛
    鞠继武
    十年前，我曾经到过祖国的最南方——南沙群岛。
    当大陆北方海洋上还漂流着片片浮冰的时候，南沙群岛的“大春海”（1月至5月）鱼汛期就已开始了。千百只渔船在绿波万顷的南中国海上，张满风帆向祖国最南的一群岛屿——南沙群岛进发，构成了一幅十分壮丽的图景。
    南沙群岛是由许多露出海面的珊瑚岛和隐没海中的珊瑚礁组成的。它散布的范围很广，位置最南的接近印度尼西亚，最东的接近菲律宾，最西的距离越南也不远。它们的面积都小，最大的太平岛，也不过一点七平方里。其次较大的有中业岛、南威岛、北子岛和南子岛等。
    在太平岛上，我遇见了许多南海渔民，这儿是他们最常停留的地方。太平岛的东部，有我国渔民修建的房屋。岛的中部，是一条贯通东西的林间大路。岛上还有为我们所树立的石碑，上面刻着“南沙群岛太平岛”七个大字。岛的四周，为隐没在水中的珊瑚礁所环绕，实际上，这个岛就是位于一个大的珊瑚礁盘上。低潮的时候，礁盘大部露出水面，可以涉水而过，由于礁盘上面，珊瑚嶙峋，确是步履维艰。高潮的时候，礁盘隐没，渔船及小艇方可直接靠岸。
    由太平岛西南航行，便到了南威岛。南威岛是新加坡到马尼拉及香港的航轮所经之地。它的东北方有一个深约十四公尺的水道，航轮可以直接靠岸，这样，更增加了它在海洋交通上的重要性。
    南沙群岛位于北纬十一度半与北纬四度之间的热带海洋中。气候也属于热带海洋性。就是在全年中最冷的月份（12月、1月）里，温度也在摄氏二十六度以上。由于受了海洋的调剂，在全年中最热的七、八月里，温度也不太高。一日之内，一年之中，相差不大。可以说是长夏无冬，不分四季。至于雨量亦很丰沛，平均每年都在一千毫米以上，而且各月分配均匀。
    由于全年高温多雨，这些岛屿上生长着密密丛丛的常绿阔叶的林木。有高耸云霄的椰林、巨大的番木瓜树、菠萝蜜树和羊角蕉等。它们都终年不断地开着艳丽的花朵，结着鲜美的果实。林下还长满着茂草野花，终年常青，四季不谢。
    这些岛屿的沿岸，是海浪和潮汐进退冲刷的沙滩，像一条洁白的玉带，成为绿色的岛屿和绿色的海洋的天然分界线。
    南沙群岛出产着丰富的极具经济价值的水产。岛的周围生长着石花菜、马尾藻、海人草及紫菜等藻类植物，栖息着海参、钟螺大蚵及玳瑁等动物。这些植物和动物又引来了它们的主顾：鲣、鲔、旗、红、鲨等鱼类来觅食产卵，因而成了我国在南中国海上一个重要的远洋渔场。这些鱼类又引来了它们的主顾——鲣鸟，来觅食产卵、因而又成了我国在南中国海上一个重要的鸟粪产区。
    石花菜可制琼胶，是美味的食品，又是医药上和生物研究上的培养剂。马尾藻和紫菜可以提炼碘、钾等医药上和工业上所需要的化学药品。海人草可以提制山道宁，是驱除蛔虫的特效药。各种鱼类可制鱼干及罐头，可以提炼鱼肝油，鱼骨还可以制肥田粉。鸟粪含有大量的磷、有机质及少量的氮钾，是制造肥田粉及咖啡因的原料。这些物产都是我们取之不尽的宝贵的天然资源。
