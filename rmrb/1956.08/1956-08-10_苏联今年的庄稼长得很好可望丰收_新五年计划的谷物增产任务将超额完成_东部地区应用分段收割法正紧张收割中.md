Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The Soviet "Pravda" said that the crops in the Soviet Union are growing well almost everywhere this year. It is expected that the amount of grain the country obtains this year will exceed the highest level in history.

The newspaper pointed out in an editorial on August 3rd that in the past three years, the Soviet Union has expanded its sown area by 37 million hectares. This year, the Russian Federation alone will sell 2.2 billion poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain to the state. This amount is roughly equivalent to the total grain procurement of the entire Soviet Union not long ago.

Recently, other Soviet newspapers have also mentioned the expected achievements in grain production this year in reports and articles. It is reported that the crops are growing particularly well in the eastern reclaimed areas, where more than 33 million hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed in the past two years. The harvest in these areas will play a particularly important role in increasing the total grain output of the Soviet Union and the country's grain procurement. For example, the Kazakh Republic has guaranteed to sell 1 billion poods of grain to the state, which is almost ten times the highest previous sales volume.

In Siberia, another important reclaimed area, 1 billion poods of grain will also be sold to the state this year. Among them, the grain sales volume in the Altai Territory alone will be 70 million poods more than in 1954, the year with the best harvest in history.

Judging from the expected bumper harvest, the grain received by the Soviet Union this year can not only meet all the basic needs for grain, but also reserve a large amount of grain. This will be a decisive step in completing the huge task of increasing the total grain output to 11 billion poods as stipulated in the new five-year plan.

Soviet Deputy Minister of State Farms, Kalchenko, pointed out in an interview with a "Red Star" reporter on August 4th that the achievements in Soviet grain production this year prove that "the grain production increase target stipulated in the new five-year plan will be greatly overfulfilled ahead of schedule."

This newspaper, Moscow, 9th: A tense harvest is underway in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. More and more harvesting machines are being put into the golden wheat sea. Agricultural workers are making good use of the experience in southern Soviet Union, concentrating machines in the parts where grains ripen first, and carrying out large-scale staged harvesting.

The harvest in southern Kazakhstan is nearing completion. The hot harvest work is expanding from the south to the north. The "Jinjiao" grain state farm, established on new land in the Jambyl Region in the south, yielded 17 quintals of grain per hectare. This young farm guarantees to deliver 2.5 million poods of grain to the state.

On the northern new land, spring wheat ears are heavy and grains are full, yielding 16 to 25 quintals per hectare. Harvester drivers are competing in the fields. Countless trucks are transporting grain from the fields to the state purchasing stations. State farms and collective farms in Kazakhstan have delivered the first batch of new grain to the state, a total of 50 million poods.

The farmers in the Altai Region of Siberia are working hard to supply the state with 300 million poods of grain. This number is three times more than the best harvest in the Altai Region before the reclamation of new land. At present, the Klyuchevsky purchasing station has received more than 80,000 tons of new grain. Many advanced combine harvester drivers have emerged in the harvesting work. Gubin, a hero of socialist labor, used two "C-60" harvesters to harvest 60 hectares of wheat in one day. Thousands of harvesters are currently learning from them.

The Chkalov Region of the Urals has also delivered 3.5 million poods of grain to the state. Some areas have used the Maltsev cultivation method, yielding 18 to 22 quintals per hectare. Agricultural workers in the Kurgan Region have decided to supply the state with 36 million poods of grain beyond the plan.

### 苏联今年的庄稼长得很好可望丰收  新五年计划的谷物增产任务将超额完成  东部地区应用分段收割法正紧张收割中

    苏联今年的庄稼长得很好可望丰收
    新五年计划的谷物增产任务将超额完成
    东部地区应用分段收割法正紧张收割中
    据新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联“真理报”说，今年苏联的庄稼几乎到处都长得很好。预料国家在这一年得到的谷物数量将超过历史上最高的水平。
    这家报纸八月三日在它的一篇社论中指出，最近三年来，苏联的播种面积扩大了三千七百万公顷。今年单是俄罗斯联邦一个共和国就将交售给国家二十二亿普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）谷物。这个数目大约相当于不久以前全苏联的谷物采购总量。
    最近，苏联的其他报纸在报道和文章中也谈到了今年预期中的谷物生产的成就。有消息说，在过去两年中开垦了三千三百多万公顷荒地的东部开垦地区，今年的庄稼长得特别好。这些地方的收成在增加苏联谷物总产量和国家的粮食采购量方面将起特别重要的作用。例如，哈萨克共和国已经保证要交售给国家十亿普特谷物，即差不多等于过去最高交售量的十倍。
    在另一个重要的开垦区西伯利亚，今年也将交售给国家十亿普特谷物。其中单阿尔泰边疆区的谷物交售量，将比历史上收成最好的1954年多七千万普特。
    从预期的丰收看来，苏联今年收到的粮食不仅可以满足对谷物的一切的基本需要，而且还可以储备大量粮食。在完成新五年计划规定的把谷物总产量增产到一百一十亿普特这个巨大任务方面，这将是有决定意义的一步。
    苏联国营农场部副部长卡尔钦科八月四日在对“红星报”记者的谈话中就曾经指出，今年苏联谷物生产的成就证明，“新五年计划规定的谷物增产任务将大大提前超额完成。”
    本报莫斯科9日电　苏联东部地区展开着紧张的收割。越来越多的收割机器投进金黄色麦海中去。农业劳动者很好地利用苏联南部的经验，把机器集中在谷物先熟的部分，进行大规模的分段收割。
    哈萨克斯坦南部的收割将近结束。热火朝天的收割工作正从南部扩展到北部。在南部詹布尔州新地上建立的“近交”谷物国营农场，每公顷打了十七公担粮食。这个年青的农场保证交给国家二百五十万普特谷物。
    在北部新地上，春小麦麦穗沉重，颗粒饱满，每公顷可打十六公担到二十五公担，收割机手们在田野上竞赛着。无数的汽车正把粮食从田间运到国家采购站。哈萨克斯坦的国营农场和集体农庄向国家交了第一批新粮，共五千万普特。
    西伯利亚的阿尔泰区的农民正在为供给国家三亿普特粮食而努力。这个数目比阿尔泰区开垦新地以前最好收成时还多三倍。目前克留切夫斯克采购站已收到送去的八万多吨新粮。在收割工作中涌现了许多先进的联合收割机手。社会主义劳动英雄古宾用两架“C—六十”式收割机一天收割了六十公顷小麦。目前成千收割工作者正向他们学习。
    乌拉尔的契卡洛夫区也交给了国家三百五十万普特粮食。有些地区运用了马尔采夫耕作方法，每公顷可打十八公担到二十二公担。库尔干区农业工作者决定超计划供给国家三千六百万普特粮食。
