(Kunming Dispatch) The Dazhai Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Simao County, Yunnan Province, has established a system of visiting the masses and has achieved good results. Recently, they studied the Central Committee's instructions on ensuring increased production and ensuring that more than 90% of the commune members increase their income. They unanimously realized the importance of mobilizing the masses and recognized that to mobilize the masses, it is first necessary to care about their hardships and help them overcome difficulties. They stipulated that party members should visit commune members once every ten days, dividing up the work by area and promptly helping commune members solve their difficulties. The first visit demonstrated the necessity of this system. Female commune member Rao Jiyu only had thirteen work points this year, and party members and cadres believed she was lazy. This time, branch committee member Li Xiu visited her and learned that she had a gynecological disease for two years. She had no money to get treatment and was afraid that the cadres would say she was shirking, so she had delayed it. Now she couldn't work anymore. Li Xiu went to the credit cooperative to borrow money for her medical treatment. She said with great emotion, "Even a grasshopper can kick down a blade of grass. If my illness is cured, I can still be a screw!" Branch committee member Ding Huandi not only visited Wang Youfa's family in the seventh team himself, solving his family's food shortage problem, but also organized five elementary school students to visit together. When the elementary school students visited the family of soldier Ma Jin'an, they found that his family was afraid that their income would decrease if Ma Rong joined the army, and they were not very clear about how many work points they had earned. After this issue was reported to the commune cadres, the team resolved it. When Ding Huandi visited Zhang Shouchong's wife, he learned that she was sick and could not work, so he helped her find medicine. This moved her deeply.

After this visit, the sick received treatment, those short of food were able to buy food, and those with ideological concerns were resolved. The production enthusiasm of the commune members was greatly increased. The thirty-two laborers in the second production team of the seventh team, whose attendance rate was only 75% before, are now working at 100% attendance.

    建立定期访问群众的制度
    本报昆明电　中共云南省思茅县大寨乡支部建立了访问群众的制度，收到很好的效果。最近，他们学习了中央关于保证增产，保证90％以上的社员增加收入的指示，一致认识到发动群众的重要；并且认识到：要发动群众，首先就要关心群众的疾苦，帮助群众克服困难。他们规定：党员每十天访问社员一次，分片包干，及时帮助社员解决困难问题。第一次的访问就说明了这个制度的必要。女社员饶季玉今年工分还只有十三分，党员和干部都认为她偷懒。这次支委李秀去访问她，才知道她有妇女病已经两年了。要去医治没有钱，又怕干部说她躲懒，就这样拖了下来，现在活也不能做了。李秀就到信用社贷钱给她医病。她很感动地说：“一个蚂蚱蹬得倒一根草，要是我病医好了，还能起个螺丝钉的作用。”支委丁奂弟除自己访问了七队王有发家，解决了他家缺粮问题外，并组织了五个小学生一同访问。小学生在访问军属马金安家的时候，发现他家怕马荣参军了他家里的收入会减少；已经得了多少工分也不大清楚。这问题反映给社干部以后，已经由队上去解决。丁奂弟在访问张寿从的女人的时候，知道她有病不能出工，就去帮助她找药。这使她极为感动。
    经过这一次访问，有病的得到了医治，缺粮的买得了粮，思想有顾虑的也得到了解决，社员的生产热情大为高涨。第七队第二生产组的三十二个劳动力，以前出勤率只到75％，现在已是百分之百的出工了。
