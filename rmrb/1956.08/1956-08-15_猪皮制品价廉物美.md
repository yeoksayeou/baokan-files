Pigskin Products are Inexpensive and of Good Quality

	Some pigskin products on display at the Daily Use Industrial Products Quality Exhibition held at the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center are attracting much attention. Among them are women's leather handbags produced by the Tianjin Queen Leather Goods Factory. These handbags are small and exquisite, in colors such as jujube red, dark green, and champagne. The shiny brass locks make the handbags even more attractive. The leather surface is also embossed with delicate and dense patterns.

	The leather suitcases manufactured by the Shanghai Leather Company have fine and elastic leather fibers. Cowhide suitcases will become deflated after being used for a long time, while pigskin suitcases always look like new, with the lids bulging.

	The leather shoes recently made of pigskin by the Shanghai No. 1 Shoe United Factory, Tianjin Jinan Tannery, and Changchun Shoe Factory come in red, green, blue, gray, white, black, and champagne colors. There are many styles, in addition to the ordinary deep-cut and shallow-cut styles, there are also small round-eye styles, embossed styles, flower-appliqued styles on the toe, and various styles made with straps, all of which are beautiful and elegant. In the past, leather shoes made of pigskin were relatively hard due to operational shortcomings, making them prone to rubbing and cracking. The ones manufactured now do not have these shortcomings. Compared with cowhide shoes with the same utility value, each pair is almost half the price.

	However, the water absorption rate of pigskin is greater than that of cowhide. Pigskin products will have reduced wear resistance after absorbing too much water. Therefore, it is best to keep pigskin products dry at all times when using them.

    猪皮制品价廉物美
    在北京苏联展览馆举行的日用工业品质量展览会里，陈列着的一些猪皮制品，很引人注意。在这里，有天津皇后皮件厂生产的女式皮手提包。这些手提包小巧玲珑，有枣红色的，有深绿色的，有香槟色的。那金光闪闪的铜锁使手提包显得更光彩悦目。皮子上面还压有细致而稠密的花纹。
    上海皮革公司制造的皮箱，皮子纤维细密，有弹性。用牛皮制的皮箱用久了就会瘪下去，而猪皮皮箱总是像新的一样，盖子鼓鼓的。
    上海制鞋第一联营厂，天津津南制革厂和长春制鞋厂最近用猪革制成的皮鞋，有红、绿、蓝、灰、白、黑、香槟等色。花样很多，除普通深口、浅口的以外，还有小圆眼的，压花的，鞋头上贴花的，用带子掇成各种式样的，都很美观大方。过去用猪革制造的皮鞋，由于操作上有缺点，皮革较硬，穿起来容易磨脚，容易破裂，现在制造的都没有这些缺点。比起具有同样使用价值的牛皮皮鞋来，每双价格几乎要便宜一半。
    但是，猪革的吸水率比牛革大。猪革制品吸水过多以后就要减少耐磨力。所以，使用猪革制品的时候最好使它经常保持干燥。
