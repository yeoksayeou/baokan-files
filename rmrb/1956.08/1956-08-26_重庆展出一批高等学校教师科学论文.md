Xinhua News Agency Report: A batch of scientific papers by university teachers in Chongqing are being exhibited at the "Chongqing Municipal Teaching Exhibition of Universities, Middle and Primary Schools." Teachers from the Sericulture Department of Southwest Agricultural College, based on the abundance of natural Tussah forests and the widespread cultivation of castor trees in Sichuan, began experiments on the breeding of Tussah silkworms and castor silkworms. Their papers have received much attention from visitors. The teachers' experiments in the Chongqing area this spring have preliminarily proven that Tussah silkworms and castor silkworms can be bred and promoted in the Sichuan area. They cultivated univoltine and bivoltine Tussah silkworms that grow in Tussah forests. The Tussah silkworms raised this spring began to spin cocoons after only thirty-three days. The average cocoon yield per moth is one and a half to two times higher than that of Guizhou Tussah silkworms. The cocoon layer is one centimeter thick. The survival rate of domestically raised castor silkworms is as high as 95%, and the cocooning rate is 92.19%.

Among the exhibited papers is a systematic study of the strength and physical properties of stone materials by the Building Materials Teaching and Research Group of Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering. They have already completed more than 1,000 test pieces, providing some detailed research data on stone materials in the Chongqing area. There are many mountains and stone material production in Southwestern China. With systematic information about stone materials, the construction departments can consider using local materials when designing.

A total of eighty-seven relatively important scientific research papers by university teachers were exhibited at this meeting.

    重庆展出一批高等学校教师科学论文
    据新华社讯　重庆市高等学校教师一批科学论文在“重庆市大、中、小学教学展览会”上展出。西南农学院蚕桑系教师根据四川天然柞林丰富和蓖麻树栽培较多的特点，开始对柞蚕和蓖麻蚕的繁殖进行试验，所作的论文，很受观众重视。教师们今春在重庆地区试验结果，初步证明柞蚕和蓖麻蚕可以在四川地区繁殖、推广。他们培育了生长在柞林里的一化性、二化性柞蚕。今年春季的柞蚕饲养三十三天就开始结茧。平均每只蛾的收茧量比贵州柞蚕每只蛾收茧量高一倍半到二倍以上。茧层有一公分厚。家饲的蓖麻蚕生命率高达95％，结茧率92.19％。
    展出的论文中还有重庆建筑工程学院建筑材料教研组对石料强度和物理性质的系统研究。目前他们已经完成一千多个试件，对重庆地区的石料提供了一部分详细的研究资料。西南地区山多，产石料。有了系统的关于石料的资料，建筑部门设计时就可以考虑就地取材。
    在这次会上，共展出了高等学校教师较重要的科学研究论文八十七件。
