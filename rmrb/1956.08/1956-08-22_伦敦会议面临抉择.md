　　The London Conference Faces a Choice

　　The London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue has now reached the stage where it must decide whether it can find a way to solve the problem.

　　Since the conference began on August 16th, it has revealed two different approaches to resolving the Suez Canal issue. The United States, Britain, and France verbally respect Egyptian sovereignty, but in reality, they disregard it and want to implement so-called "international control" over the Suez Canal. They want the London conference to accept majority voting procedures in order to use this procedure to pass their "international control" plan, and then use force to threaten Egypt into accepting it. However, only a very few countries such as Australia are following their lead, and their procedural manipulations have finally failed.

　　On the other hand, the Soviet Union, India, and other Asian and African countries are firmly adhering to the line of upholding and respecting Egyptian sovereignty. They oppose any plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal and advocate holding an international conference with Egypt's participation to resolve the issue of guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the canal. They oppose the use of force and threats of force, and advocate peaceful resolution of the issue based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. The principles put forward by the Soviet Union, India, and other Asian and African countries have received sympathy and support from many participating countries to varying degrees.

　　Soviet representative Shepilov put forward several basic principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue on August 17th and suggested organizing a preparatory committee with Egypt's participation to prepare for a broad international conference on the Suez Canal as suggested by Egypt. Indian representative Menon also put forward a proposal on August 20th, the principles of which are basically consistent with those put forward by the Soviet Union. Menon's proposal advocates considering all steps, including holding a broad international conference, to discuss revising the 1888 Constantinople Convention and reaffirming the principle of free navigation of the canal. He also suggested establishing a consultative body with responsibilities for consultation, negotiation, and liaison based on regional representation and interests, and suggested that the Egyptian government submit annual reports of the Egyptian Suez Canal Company to the United Nations.

　　Obviously, the suggestions of the Soviet Union and India are completely reasonable and practical. Because these suggestions strictly respect Egypt's sovereignty on the one hand, and take into account the importance of the Suez Canal to international navigation and the interests of maritime countries on the other hand, and everyone knows that the Egyptian government has already expressed that it respects the navigation interests of other countries. If the London conference can reach an agreement on the suggestions of the Soviet Union and India, there will be a good chance for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

　　However, the United States, Britain, and France are trying to insist on their "international control" plan that disregards Egyptian sovereignty and continue to threaten Egypt. US representative Dulles put forward a four-point plan on August 16th, advocating interference in Egypt's management rights over the canal. Based on this plan, he put forward a draft declaration on August 20th, attempting to obtain the agreement of the conference.

　　Although Dulles claimed in his draft declaration that "an appropriate solution must... respect Egypt's sovereignty," the entire draft declaration is full of intentions to grossly violate Egyptian sovereignty. No one can deny that since the Suez Canal is part of Egyptian territory, and since Egypt has the right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, managing the canal and handling affairs related to the Suez Canal Company are matters within the scope of Egyptian sovereignty, and no one can interfere. However, Dulles demanded the establishment of a "Suez Canal Board" to take on the "responsibility" of determining canal tolls and "managing, maintaining, and developing the canal and expanding the canal." According to Dulles's proposal, Egypt will have no right to distribute the income from the Suez Canal, nor will it have the right to decide on compensation to be given to former Suez Canal Company shareholders. In other words, this so-called "Suez Canal Board" will be a revival of the former Suez Canal Company under foreign monopolistic manipulation, and its exploitation and plunder of the Egyptian people will be even worse.

　　Dulles's draft declaration, like his four-point plan, is completely unreasonable, superficially respecting Egypt's sovereignty while actually undermining it. However, when Dulles put forward this draft declaration, he said that it should not be considered whether the Egyptian government would agree.

　　Dulles thus wants to have the conference agree to this draft declaration, which he knows Egypt will not agree to, as a basis for armed intervention against Egypt. On the one hand, he uses sweet words and a mild posture to deceive the countries participating in the conference, saying that this conference "is not a conference that can make decisions binding on those who do not agree," "is not a conference to send any ultimatum to Egypt through it," but on the other hand, he makes this draft declaration a final ultimatum that Egypt and the participating countries must accept. He threatened Egypt and the participating countries with a fierce look, saying that if Egypt does not accept the demands of the United States, Britain, and France, "this creates a new situation that our government will then have to consider. In that case, the entire participating countries of this conference or some participating countries may - or may not - make further relevant decisions."

　　However, Dulles's tactics of both coaxing and deceiving will not work. Regardless of whether the United States, Britain, and France make any "decisions," they will not solve the Suez Canal issue. The days when a few major powers made "decisions" about the fate of other countries are long gone. If the United States, Britain, and France insist on pushing forward their plan regardless of world public opinion and the feelings of the Asian and African people, they will be the ones who ultimately suffer.

　　Now, the London conference is facing a choice of which path to take. The stakes are very clear. Seeking a solution in accordance with the Soviet-Indian plan can eliminate the war crisis in the Middle East and ensure the shipping interests of all countries. If the United States, Britain, and France are allowed to implement their "international control" plan, a situation will arise that seriously threatens the peace of the Middle East and the world. At that time, those who support the US-British-French plan will not only fail to maintain their own interests, but will also bear the serious responsibility for undermining world peace together with the United States, Britain, and France. All responsible politicians participating in the London conference must give this issue careful and serious consideration.

### 伦敦会议面临抉择

    伦敦会议面临抉择
    在伦敦举行的讨论苏彝士运河问题的会议，现在已经临到了将要决定它是否能够找到解决问题的途径的阶段。
    从会议在八月十六日开始举行以来，就显示出了在解决苏彝士运河问题上的两条不同的路线。美、英、法的路线是在口头上尊重埃及主权，实际上却无视埃及的主权，而要对苏彝士运河实行所谓“国际管制”。它们想使伦敦会议接受多数表决的程序，以便利用这个程序来通过它们的“国际管制”计划，然后用武力威胁迫使埃及接受。但是，追随它们的路线的只有澳大利亚等极少数的国家，而它们在程序问题上玩弄的手段也终于遭到了失败。
    另一方面，苏联、印度和其他亚非国家所遵循的，是坚决维护和尊重埃及主权的路线。它们反对任何“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划，主张举行有埃及参加的国际会议，来解决保证运河航行自由的问题。它们反对使用武力和武力威胁，主张根据联合国宪章原则来和平解决问题。苏联、印度和其他亚非国家所提出的这些原则，在不同的程度上得到了许多与会国家的同情和支持。
    苏联代表谢皮洛夫在八月十七日提出了解决苏彝士运河问题的几项基本原则，并且建议组织一个有埃及参加的筹备委员会，来筹备举行埃及建议的广泛的苏彝士运河国际会议。印度代表梅农在八月二十日也提出了一项建议，这项建议中的原则部分同苏联提出的原则基本上是一致的。梅农的建议主张考虑采取一切步骤，包括举行广泛的国际会议，来讨论修改1888年的君士坦丁堡公约，重新肯定运河自由通航的原则。他还建议根据地区代表和权益成立一个负有咨询、协商和联络的职责的协商机构，并且建议埃及政府向联合国递交埃及苏彝士运河公司的年度报告。
    显然，苏联和印度的建议是完全合理和实际可行的。因为这些建议一方面严格尊重埃及的主权，另一方面又照顾到了苏彝士运河对国际通航的重要意义和海运国家的利益，而大家知道，埃及政府早已表示过它是尊重其他国家的通航利益的。如果伦敦会议能就苏联和印度的建议达成协议，苏彝士运河问题就有了和平解决的良好机会。
    但是，美、英、法三国却企图坚持自己无视埃及主权的“国际管制”计划，并且继续对埃及进行威胁。美国代表杜勒斯在八月十六日提出了一项四点计划，主张干涉埃及对运河的管理权。根据这个计划，他在八月二十日又提出了一项宣言草案，企图得到会议的同意。
    虽然杜勒斯在他的宣言草案中声称“适当的解决办法必须……尊重埃及的主权”，但是整个宣言草案中却充满了粗暴地侵犯埃及主权的打算。谁都不能否认，既然苏彝士运河是埃及领土的一部分，既然埃及有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，管理这条运河、处理有关苏彝士运河公司的事务，就是埃及主权范围以内的事情，任何人都不能干涉。可是杜勒斯却要求建立一个“苏彝士运河委员会”，来负起决定运河通行费用和“管理、保养和发展这条运河以及扩大运河”的“责任”。按照杜勒斯的主张，埃及将无权分配苏彝士运河的收入，也无权决定给予前苏彝士运河公司股票持有人的补偿。换句话说，这个所谓“苏彝士运河委员会”，将是在外国垄断操纵下的前苏彝士运河公司的复活，而且它对埃及人民的剥削和掠夺将有过之而无不及。
    杜勒斯的宣言草案和他的四点计划一样，是完全不合理的，是表面上尊重埃及的主权而实际上却破坏了埃及的主权。可是杜勒斯在提出这个宣言草案的时候却说，不应当考虑埃及政府是不是会同意。
    杜勒斯这样就是想使会议同意这个明知埃及不会同意的宣言草案，来作为对埃及进行武装干涉的根据。他一方面花言巧语地用和缓姿态欺骗参加会议的国家，说什么这次会议“并不是一个可以作出对那些并不同意的国家有约束力的决定的会议”，“并不是一次通过它向埃及送出任何最后通牒的会议”，另一方面他却又使这个宣言草案成为埃及和到会国家必须接受的最后通牒。他凶相毕露地恫吓埃及和到会国家说，如果埃及不接受美、英、法的主张，“这就造成了一种我国政府到那个时候要予以考虑的新的情况。在那种情况下，这次会议的全体参加国或者某些参加国之间可能会——或者可能不会——作出进一步的有关的决定”。
    但是，杜勒斯这种软哄硬骗的手段是起不了什么作用的。不管美、英、法作出或是不作出任何“决定”，都解决不了苏彝士运河问题。由少数大国对其他国家的命运作出“决定”的日子早已过去了。如果美、英、法硬要不顾世界舆论和亚非人民的情绪推行它们的计划，那末最后倒霉的将是它们自己。
    现在，伦敦会议正面临着走哪一条路的抉择。利害是很清楚的。按照苏联、印度的方案来寻求解决，中东的战争危机就可以消除，各国的航运利益就可以得到保障。如果听任美、英、法推行它们的“国际管制”计划，就会产生严重威胁中东和世界和平的局面，到那时候，支持美、英、法计划的人不但不能保持自己的利益，而且将同美、英、法一起担负起破坏世界和平的严重责任。参加伦敦会议的一切有责任感的政治家，都不能不对这个问题作慎重和严肃的考虑。
