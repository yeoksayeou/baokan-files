Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: An aircraft equipped with aerial photography equipment took off from Beijing this morning. On board were seventeen Chinese and Soviet aerial surveying personnel. This aircraft is undertaking a special mission - to survey the new railway line between Xi'an and Wuwei.

The aerial survey of the railway route from Xi'an to Wuwei is one of the six important railway trunk lines that China plans to use aerial surveying for. The other five lines to be surveyed aerially are: the railway from Xining via the north of the Qaidam Basin to Mang'ai; the railway connecting to Lhasa from the Lan (Zhou) Qing (Hai) line; the railway from Xi'an via Laohekou to Hankou; the railway from Chengdu via Xichang to Kunming; and the railway between Weining or Rongfeng (formerly known as Xuanwei) in Yunnan to Guiyang. The total length of the six railways is approximately five thousand kilometers.

Representatives from the Chinese and Soviet railway departments held talks in May this year. Both sides agreed that the Soviet Union would send ninety-three aerial survey experts to help China complete the aerial survey tasks for these five thousand kilometers of railways. The Chinese side established a General Aerial Survey Team and five aerial photograph control survey detachments, and mobilized a large number of engineering and technical personnel to cooperate with Soviet experts. At the same time, they will learn aerial surveying techniques and experience from the Soviet experts, so that they can independently carry out aerial surveying work in the future.

There are many advantages to using aerial surveying. It is both fast and accurate, and saves manpower. Especially in mountainous areas with complex terrain and difficult living conditions, it can avoid many difficulties in ground surveying. The aerial survey work for these six lines began preparations in July 1956, and it is expected to be completed within a year and a half by the end of 1957.

The leader of the Soviet Railway Aerial Survey General Team to China, Alexeiyev, arrived in Beijing on August 3rd, and other leaders and forty-odd experts of the General Team have also arrived successively. They also brought some lightweight instruments and an aircraft specially used for aerial surveying.

The Chinese Ministry of Railways has dispatched five aerial photograph control survey detachments and is stepping up preparations for various tasks.

### 五千公里新铁路线的航空测量开始

    五千公里新铁路线的航空测量开始
    新华社8日讯　一架装有航空摄影设备的飞机今天早晨自北京起飞了。飞机上载运着十七个中苏两国航空测量工作人员。这架飞机担负着一项特殊的任务——去勘测西安到武威之间的新铁路线。
    航测西安到武威间的铁路路线是中国计划采用航空测量的六条重要铁路干线之一。将用航空测量的其他五条线路是：自西宁经过柴达木盆地迤北到茫崖的铁路；从兰（州）青（海）线上接通到拉萨的铁路；从西安经老河口到汉口的铁路；从成都经过西昌到昆明的铁路和从云南的威宁或榕峰（原名宣威）到贵阳之间的铁路。六条铁路总长约五千公里。
    中苏两国铁路部门代表曾经在今年五月进行会谈。双方确定由苏联派出九十三个航测专家帮助中国完成这五千公里铁路的航空测量任务。中国方面成立一个航空勘察总队和五个航测像片控制测量分队，调集大批工程技术人员和苏联专家合作，同时向苏联专家学习航测的技术和经验，以便将来独立进行航测工作。
    采用航空测量的好处很多。既快又准确，节省人力。特别是在地形复杂，生活条件艰苦的山区，可以避免很多地面勘测的困难。这六条路的航测工作，从1956年7月开始准备，预计到1957年底，在一年半的期间内就可以完成。
    苏联派来中国的铁路航空勘测总队队长阿历克赛也夫已经在八月三日到达北京，总队的其他负责人和四十几个专家，也陆续到达。他们还带来了一些轻便仪器和一架专门作航测用的飞机。
    中国铁道部已派出五个航测像片控制测量分队，并加紧进行各项准备工作。
