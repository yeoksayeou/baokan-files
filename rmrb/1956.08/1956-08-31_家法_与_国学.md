    "Family Tradition" and "National Learning"
    Bao Chang

    The "Biographies of Confucian Scholars" in the "Book of the Later Han" mentions that after Emperor Guangwu restored the Han Dynasty, a new situation was opened up in academic culture. At that time, people "sought out missing texts and pieced together lost ones. Previously, scholars from all over the country mostly harbored books and escaped into the forests, but from then on, everyone carried their books and gathered in the capital. ... Therefore, five classics doctoral instructors were established, each teaching according to their family tradition. The Book of Changes had the Shi, Meng, Liangqiu, and Jing schools; the Book of Documents had the Ouyang, Da, and Xiao Xiahou schools; the Book of Poetry had the Qi, Lu, Han, and Mao schools; the Book of Rites had the Da and Xiao Dai schools; and the Spring and Autumn Annals had the Yan and Yan schools. In total, there were fourteen doctoral instructors, all led by the Court of Imperial Sacrifices." This refers to the "family tradition" in academic research.

    Using "family tradition" to teach academics was a last resort at the time. Emperor Qin Shihuang burned books and buried scholars alive, greatly harming the development of culture. At that time, hardly any classics were left, so the few remaining old scholars had to pass them down through "family tradition." But this brought many benefits: "One classic could be explained with over a million words, and a master could have thousands of students." It can be said that it was another "hundred schools of thought contending."

    When this custom was abolished and "family tradition" was transformed into "national learning," the flourishing scene in the academic world declined. For example, in the early Han Dynasty, there were at least four schools of poetry: Qi, Lu, Han, and Mao. During the reign of Emperor Ping of the Han Dynasty, only the Mao Commentary to the Book of Poetry was established as "national learning" (see Lu Deming's "Classic Exegesis"). From then on, the other schools of poetry were no longer transmitted. The Mao Poetry that has been passed down to this day is undoubtedly a priceless national literary treasure, but wouldn't it have been even better if more schools of poetry had been passed down? We still feel regret about this.

    Which is better, "family tradition" or "national learning"? Of course, it depends on the nature of the academic itself. But one thing is always certain: a hundred schools of thought contending is always better than one school dominating, and the words of a hundred schools are often more stimulating to academic development than the words of one school.

    Currently, in the academic field, we do not have the concept of establishing "national learning." The Party put forward the policy of free discussion in academics a few years ago. Recently, it has loudly put forward the slogan of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." However, within the academic and cultural circles, some people cannot distinguish the above principles. For example, it is a good thing for responsible academic departments to organize a group of people to collectively compile authoritative works or textbooks on a certain discipline. But quite a few people think that this is "establishing national learning." There are those who blindly believe in it, and there are those who hold different views but are afraid to express them. The worst thing is that it creates a dependence mentality in some people. It is said that some disciplines in universities have not been able to start courses for a long time, and those who have studied the course do not dare to teach it, but wait for the responsible department to compile a "textbook." If the textbook is slow in coming, then they keep waiting, and the discipline remains stagnant...

    This situation should be changed. Even if a responsible department compiles a textbook, it should not be seen as a "national learning," or rather, it is the collective creation of a group of "families," which can be said to be "one school of thought," and therefore can be debated. At the same time, we hope that more "families" will pass on their "family tradition," that is, "one family's words." When many families can argue about a discipline, it will naturally move towards prosperity.

    Of course, whether it is one school of thought or one family's words, what we hope most is that it can be like Bo Ya's zither, with both beautiful tones and content. We do not want it to be like Chekhov's drum, which sounds loud but is actually empty.

### “家法”与“国学”

    “家法”与“国学”
    鲍昌
    “后汉书”的“儒林传”上曾谈到：汉朝光武中兴后，在学术文化上开辟了一个新局面。当时“采求阙文，补缀漏逸。先是四方学士，多怀挟图书，遁逃林薮，自是莫不抱负坟策，云会京师。……于是立五经博士，各以家法教授。易有施、孟、梁丘、京氏；尚书欧阳、大、小夏侯；诗齐、鲁、韩、毛；礼大、小戴；春秋严、颜。凡十四博士，太常差次总领焉。”这里说的，就是这种学术研究上的“家法”。
    用“家法”来讲授学术，在当时是迫不得已的事。秦始皇曾经焚书坑儒，大大戕害了文化的发展。当时几乎没有留下多少典籍，硕果仅存的老先生们，便只好传之以“家法”。但这却带来不少好处：“一经说至百余万言，大师众至千余人。”可以说，又是一次“百家争鸣”。
    什么时候取消了这种风尚，把“家法”变为“国学”，那学术界的繁荣气象就为之一蹶。例如诗经，汉初时至少有齐、鲁、韩、毛四家传诗。汉平帝时，独把毛诗郑笺立为“国学”（见陆德明“经典释文”）。自此之后，别家的诗也就不传了。流传至今的毛诗，固然已是无价的文学国宝，但如果多传下几种诗来，岂不更是幸事。这一点，至今我们感到遗憾。
    “家法”和“国学”，究竟哪一个更好些，当然要看这学术的本身。但有一点总是可以肯定的：百家争鸣总比一家独鸣要好些，而百家之言也往往比一家之言更能刺激学术的发展。
    目前，在学术领域内，我们没有立“国学”这一说。党在前几年就提出学术上的自由讨论方针。最近又响亮地提出“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的口号来。但在学术文化界内部，有人却分不清上面的道理。例如：由负责的学术部门组织一批人，集体编写出某学科的权威性著作或教科书来，这本是好事。但颇有人以为这就是“立国学”了。盲目迷信者有之，持有异见，但怯于立论者也有之。最糟糕的是造成某些人的依赖思想。听说大学中有些学科长期开不了课，对这门课程有研究的人不敢讲，却要等待负责部门编出“教科书”来。如果教科书迟迟不来，那就一直在等待，然而这门学科也就一直在停滞……。
    应当改改这种情况了。即使是某负责部门编出了一种什么教科书，不应就看成是一种“国学”，或者不如说，那也是一群“家”们的集体创作，可说是“一派之言”，因之也可与之争鸣。与此同时，还希望有更多的“家”传之以“家法”，亦即“一家之言”。一门学术能有许多家们来争论，自然就会走向繁荣了。
    当然，一派之言也好，一家之言也好，最希望的是能像伯牙的那张琴，音调既美，又有内容。而不希望是契柯夫说过的那面鼓，听起来咚咚有声，实际上却是空的。
