	Is This the Direction?
	Lin Hanbiao, Liu Nianzi
	"Have you seen 'Ahei and Ashima' and 'Luo Shengjiao'?"
	"Yes!"
	"What do you think?"
	"Not bad."
	"Could you write a review?"
	"Well—well, these two operas still need to be studied. I'm afraid this approach is not the direction of Peking Opera reform."
	"…………"
The new Peking Operas "Ahei and Ashima" and "Luo Shengjiao" are "not bad," yet they have been met with indifference by some critics, apparently because "I'm afraid this is not the direction of Peking Opera reform."

Let's briefly discuss these two operas! These two operas are popular with audiences in Beijing and other regions. We believe that it is a very meaningful attempt to use Peking Opera to portray modern life or the lives of ethnic minorities. From the script to the performance, the artists have put in several years of hard work, and their arduous labor and serious attitude are worthy of attention. At the same time, the basic tone of these two operas is Peking Opera; they have not departed from the foundation of Peking Opera singing, acting, reciting, and fighting. Instead, they have more flexibly utilized traditional music and dance, and integrated some music and dance of ethnic minorities, attempting to express a broader life and new heroic images. Isn't this new attempt (although there are still some problems with the form of expression) worthy of our encouragement and praise? However, some people still dare not affirm these attempts simply because they have new things, "I'm afraid this is not the direction of Peking Opera reform."

To simply affirm the direction of reform of a genre from one or two new plays is enough to frighten people from trying. Without various attempts, it is impossible to find a direction. May I ask: Who can point out the future direction of development in front of a newborn baby? Or throw him away because they think crying is not his "direction"?

The significance of "Ahei and Ashima" and "Luo Shengjiao" lies in the fact that they have opened up a broader path for Peking Opera in selecting themes. Their performances have proved that the scope of Peking Opera's expression of life can be broader and more free. Peking Opera has very superior conditions for expressing historical story themes; at the same time, it has a strong vitality and a wealth of traditional music and performing arts, and it also has the conditions to express various aspects of life. Some people believe that Peking Opera has developed to its peak, has solidified, and cannot have much development anymore. This argument can be refuted without being attacked.

Critics who invariably talk about "direction," overly cautious critics, look at new things more carefully! Blocking your own eyes with this sign is naturally something others cannot interfere with; but if you use this sign to hinder other people's creation and experimentation, then it will become a sin.

    这是方向吗？
    林涵表　刘念兹
    “您看过‘阿黑与阿诗玛’和‘罗盛教’么？”
    “看了！”
    “怎么样？”
    “还不错。”
    “请您写篇评论好吗？”
    “这——这，这两个戏还得研究，这样搞恐怕不是京剧改革的方向。”
    “…………”
    新的京剧“阿黑与阿诗玛”及“罗盛教”既然“还不错”，可是却又遭受到某些批评家的冷淡对待，原来为了它“恐怕不是京剧改革的方向”。
    让我们先简单地谈谈这两个戏吧！这两个戏是受到北京和地方的观众的欢迎的。我们觉得，以京剧表现现代生活或兄弟民族的生活，这是很有意义的尝试。这两个戏从剧本到演出，艺术家们花了好几年的劳动，他们的艰辛劳动和严肃的态度是值得重视的。同时，这两个戏的基调都是京剧的，它们没有脱离京剧唱、做、念、打的基础，而是比较灵活地运用了传统的音乐舞蹈，再融合了些兄弟民族的音乐舞蹈，尝试着表现更广阔的生活和新的英雄形象。这种新的尝试（尽管还有一些表现形式的问题未解决），难道不值得我们鼓励和赞扬吗？可是，还是有人因为它有了新的东西，“恐怕不是京剧改革的方向”，连这些尝试都不敢加以肯定。
    想简单地从一两出新戏中来肯定一个剧种的改革方向，这只有吓得人不敢尝试。没有各式各样的尝试，便不能摸出一个方向。请问：有谁能够在一个新生的婴孩面前，指出他日后的发展方向？或者认为哭不是他的“方向”就把他扔掉？
    “阿黑与阿诗玛”和“罗盛教”的意义，在于它们给京剧选择题材方面开辟了更广阔的道路。它们的演出，证明了京剧表现生活的范畴是可以更广阔一些更自由一些的。京剧既有很优越的条件表现历史故事题材；同时它的生命力很强，传统音乐与表演艺术丰厚，它也有条件表现多方面的生活。有人认为，京剧已经发展到顶点，已经凝固了，不能再有多大发展，这种论调可以不攻自破了。
    言必称“方向”的批评家，过于稳重的批评家，对新的事物多看两眼吧！拿这个牌子堵住自己的睛眼，别人自然不便干涉；但是如果拿这个牌子去妨碍别人的创造和尝试，那就会变成一种罪过了。
