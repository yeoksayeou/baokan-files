Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th: The state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, through a major product quality inspection, educated its employees to value product quality and corrected the growing complacency among the workers, leading to a gradual reduction in quality accidents in various workshops.

Since the successful trial production of the first 6,000 kW steam turbine in April of last year, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory has subsequently manufactured many steam turbines within a year. After trial runs, these steam turbines proved to have excellent performance. Because the trial production and small-batch production of these steam turbines proceeded relatively smoothly, some employees began to develop paralysis and complacency, thinking that "making steam turbines is nothing more than this." As a result of this mindset, the number of quality accidents at the factory during the processing of steam turbine parts and components in the first half of this year increased month by month.

To prevent further product quality accidents, the factory launched a comprehensive product quality inspection in June. Workers in the steam turbine workshop analyzed the causes of quality accidents during the inspection. They found that many quality accidents were caused by workers being careless during operation or assuming that their skills were already proficient, resulting in not looking at drawings or being careless. In addition to analyzing the causes of quality accidents, the workers in the blade workshop also calculated the losses to the state due to quality accidents in their workshop over the past five months. They calculated that the scrapping of 853 blades and other tools in five months had caused an economic loss to the state equivalent to the price of 61,300 catties of rice.

Through this inspection, workers in all workshops renewed their emphasis on product quality and came up with many ways to ensure quality. For example, the casting workshop used to often have problems with shrinkage cavities when casting steam turbine intermediate partitions. During this quality inspection, worker Cao Boneng studied the cause of the shrinkage cavities and solved the problem. During the quality inspection, the blade workshop also summarized the advanced experience of six workers who did not produce defective products and organized its promotion in the workshop.

Currently, all departments of the factory are still revising and strengthening various systems for ensuring product quality based on the results of the quality inspection.

### 上海汽轮机厂  纠正自满思想，质量事故减少

    纠正自满思想，质量事故减少
    新华社上海20日电　国营上海汽轮机厂通过产品质量大检查教育职工重视产品质量，纠正了职工群众中逐渐滋长起来的自满思想，各车间的质量事故开始逐渐减少。
    上海汽轮机厂自从去年四月试制成功第一台六千瓩汽轮机后，接着又在一年内陆续制造了许多台汽轮机。这些汽轮机经过试车证明，性能都很好。由于这批汽轮机的试制和小批生产都进行得比较顺利，有些职工就开始产生了麻痹自满思想，认为“造汽轮机也不过如此。”这种思想滋长的结果，使得这个工厂在今年上半年加工汽轮机零件、部件的时候，质量事故月月上升。
    为了防止产品质量事故继续发生，这个工厂在六月份里展开了产品质量全面大检查。汽轮机车间的职工在检查中分析了产生质量事故的原因。他们发现许多质量事故是因为工人操作时粗心大意或自以为技术已很熟练，操作时不看图纸不细心所造成。叶片车间职工除了分析产生质量事故的原因外，并且把他们车间五个月来因质量事故给国家带来的损失算了一笔账。他们算出由于五个月内报废了八百五十三片叶片和其他工具，给国家造成了相等于六万一千三百斤大米代价的经济损失。
    通过这次检查，各车间职工都重新重视了产品质量；并且想出了许多保证质量的办法。如铸铁车间过去浇铸汽轮机中间隔板常常发生缩孔的毛病。在这次质量检查时，工人曹伯能研究了产生缩孔的原因，解决了缩孔毛病。叶片车间在质量检查中，还总结了六个工人不出废品的先进经验，在车间里组织推广。
    现在，这个工厂的各部门还在根据质量检查的结果，修订和加强各种保证产品质量的制度。
