Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, held a reception tonight to welcome the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, and Mr. David Marshall, advisor to the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation and former Chief Minister of Singapore.

Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, and Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang attended the reception.

Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with the guests individually. He raised his glass and said that he, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, welcomed the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation to China and extended his warm respect to them.

Premier Zhou said that the two delegations included representatives of all ethnic groups from Singapore and Malaya, and that such a delegation united by various ethnic groups was of very noble value. These two delegations include friends of Malay, Indian, Sinhalese, British, Chinese, and other descents, which symbolizes the great unity of the people of Singapore and the great unity of the people of the Federation of Malaya.

Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass to wish the friends of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation good health, and to wish for friendly relations between China and Singapore and Malaya, and for the success of the two delegations' trade visit to China.

Goh Tjoei Kok, the leader of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, said that their visit to China carries an important mission that is of great importance to the future economic development of Singapore.

He said that the main purpose of their visit to China was to promote trade between Singapore and China and to strengthen their economic ties.

He said, "Today, we all deeply feel that in order to promote foreign trade, we must find new ways out. To seek new ways out, we must come to China. Because we all know that today, China is comprehensively and vigorously carrying out construction and production, not only has a large number of goods that can be exported abroad, but also needs various important raw materials to step up industrial production and construction."

Lee Yan Lian, the leader of the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, said in his speech that everyone knows that Malaya is a place that produces a large quantity of rubber, with an annual output of 600,000 tons. Therefore, how to open up sales channels for rubber and find overseas markets is a matter of concern to the industrial and commercial circles of Malaya at all times. China has a vast territory and a large population, and the demand for rubber is indeed unlimited. There is no doubt that China will become one of the largest customers of Malayan rubber. China's industrial development is very rapid, and many manufactured products are of excellent quality and are inexpensive. The residents of Malaya need and welcome Chinese goods very much.

He said that promoting trade between China and Malaya is very important. We hope that through this visit to China, the people of China and Malaya will have a greater mutual understanding in the future, and that trade between China and Malaya can be better developed as a result. We believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the task of promoting Sino-Malayan trade will surely be completed successfully.

At the reception, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, expressed their warm welcome to the guests.

Chen Shutong said: "This visit by you is a good start for our future friendly exchanges. We believe that in the future, through more and closer exchanges between the industrial and commercial circles, it will surely promote the economic prosperity of Singapore, the Federation of Malaya, and China, enhance the understanding and cooperation between the peoples of Southeast Asian countries, and will make a certain contribution to world peace."

Also present at tonight's reception were responsible persons from relevant government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as people from all walks of life in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Goh Tjoei Kok, the leader of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, Lee Yan Lian, the leader of the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, and the leaders and deputy leaders of the ten groups of the two delegations, paid a visit to Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, today.

    新华社29日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通、中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席李烛尘今晚举行酒会，欢迎新加坡工商业贸易考察团、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团和新加坡工商业贸易考察团顾问、前新加坡首席部长戴维·马歇尔先生。
    国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深和对外贸易部部长叶季壮出席了酒会。
    周恩来总理同客人们一一握手。他举杯说，他代表中华人民共和国政府和人民对前来中国访问的新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团表示欢迎，并向他们致热烈的敬意。
    周总理说，两个考察团包括了新加坡和马来亚的各个民族，这种各民族团结的考察团有非常高贵的价值。这两个考察团里有马来族、印度族、锡兰族、还有英国血统、中国血统以及其他血统的朋友们，这象征着新加坡人民的大团结和马来亚联合邦人民的大团结。
    周恩来总理举杯祝新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团全体朋友们健康，祝中国和新加坡、马来亚的友好关系，祝两个考察团访问中国进行贸易的成功。
    新加坡工商业贸易考察团团长高德根说，他们到中国来负有对新加坡未来经济发展前途有极大关系的重要任务。
    他说，他们这次到中国来访问的主要目的，在于促进新加坡和中国的贸易，加强彼此的经济联系。
    他说，今天，我们大家都深深地觉得，要促进对外贸易，必须寻找新的出路。要寻求新的出路，就一定要到中国来。因为我们大家知道，今日中国正在全面地、大力地展开建设和生产，不但有大量物品可以输出国外，同时也需要各种重要原料来加紧工业生产和建设。
    马来亚工商业贸易考察团团长李延年在讲话中说，大家都知道，马来亚是大量生产树胶的地方，每年产量达六十万吨。因此，如何为树胶打开销路，寻找海外市场，乃是马来亚工商界时时刻刻所关怀的问题。中国地区广大，人口众多，对于树胶的需求，实无可限量。中国将成为马来亚树胶最大主顾之一，当无疑问。中国的工业发展得很快，许多制成品品质优良，而且价格廉宜。马来亚居民对于中国货很感需要而且非常欢迎。
    他说，促进中国与马来亚的贸易是很重要的。我们希望通过这次到中国的访问，今后中马两地的人民有更大的互相了解，中国和马来亚的贸易能因此更好地发展起来。我们相信在双方共同努力之下，促进中马贸易的任务必然能够胜利完成。
    在酒会上，中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通和中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席李烛尘向客人们表示热烈的欢迎。
    陈叔通说：“各位先生这次的访问，是我们今后友好往来的一个良好的开端。我们相信，今后通过工商界更多的更密切的往来，必将促进新加坡、马来亚联合邦和中国的经济繁荣，增进东南亚各国人民之间的了解和合作，并将为世界和平作出一定的贡献。”
    出席今晚酒会的，还有政府各有关部门、各民主党派和人民团体的负责人，北京社会各界人士等。
    据新华社29日讯　新加坡工商业贸易考察团团长高德根、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团团长李延年和这两个团的十个组的正副组长，今天拜会了中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通、中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席李烛尘。
