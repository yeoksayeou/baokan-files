Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai is now capable of manufacturing rayon, artificial wool, artificial cotton for daily-use textiles, and high-tenacity rayon for the defense industry.

The experimental workshop of the Joint State-Private Anle Rayon Factory began manufacturing viscose rayon from waste cotton and wood pulp in 1951. Last year, it also experimented with using reed pulp, bamboo pulp, and cotton stalk fiber as raw materials for rayon. At the same time, it began trial-producing artificial wool, artificial cotton, and high-tenacity rayon. Currently, the rayon produced by the experimental workshop using waste cotton and wood pulp has reached the quality standards of ordinary imported rayon. The rayon made from miscellaneous fiber raw materials has also reached or approached the standards of imported goods. The experimental workshop is currently trial-producing other types of rayon and synthetic fibers (commonly known as glass fiber), and further researching how to reasonably use miscellaneous fiber raw materials to suit large-scale production.

The Joint State-Private Anle Rayon Factory began preparations for construction in 1936 and hired experts from France and Germany to guide trial production. However, it did not go into production for more than ten years. It was not until after liberation that the experimental workshop was officially opened, and Chinese engineers led the manufacture of rayon.

Rayon is widely used in China. Beautiful brocade, gossamer-thin georgette, and many knitwear items cannot do without it. Artificial cotton and artificial wool can be woven into inexpensive and beautiful clothing, and can also be blended with cotton and wool to supplement the shortage of natural textile raw materials.

    上海已经能够制造人造丝
    据新华社讯　日用纺织工业需要的人造丝、人造毛、人造棉，以及国防工业用的强力人造丝，上海已经能够制造了。
    公私合营安乐人造丝厂实验工场，从1951年开始用废棉和木浆原料制造粘胶人造丝；到去年又试用芦苇浆、竹浆和棉秆皮纤维等原料做人造丝，同时，开始试制人造毛、人造棉和强力人造丝。现在，实验工场用废棉、木浆制出的人造丝，品质已经达到普通进口人造丝的标准；用杂纤维原料制出的人造丝，品质也达到或接近了进口货标准。目前，实验工场正在试制其他类人造丝和合成纤维（俗称玻璃丝），并进一步研究如何合理地使用杂纤维原料，使之适合大规模生产。
    公私合营安乐人造丝厂自从1936年开始筹建以来，曾聘请法、德等国的专家指导试制，十多年始终没有投入生产。直到解放以后，才正式开辟实验工场，由中国工程师领导制造人造丝。
    人造丝在我国使用非常广泛。美丽的织锦缎、薄如蝉翼的乔其纱和许多针织品都离不开它。人造棉和人造毛可以织成廉价美丽的衣料，也可以同棉和毛混纺，补充天然纺织原料的不足。
