New Things in the Countryside

　　Oxen Enter "Sanatoriums"

　　The Tongru Township First Agricultural Cooperative in Lian Shan County, Guangdong Province, has a total of 240 oxen. Because the cowsheds are far from the grassland (more than 25 *li*), the round trip for grazing takes a long time, and the time the oxen spend eating grass is relatively reduced, to a maximum of five hours. As a result, the oxen are sometimes full and sometimes hungry, and 72 of them have become thin. What to do? After discussion by the management committee, it was decided to establish an "ox sanatorium" near the grassland in a valley 15 *li* from the cooperative. The cooperative sent three experienced members to be responsible for feeding and management. The first batch of 27 of the thinnest oxen were sent to the "sanatorium," where they grazed for eight hours a day. The keepers also regularly supplemented the oxen with concentrated feed, bathed them, and treated them for lice. After more than two months of recuperation, all the thin oxen became fat and strong, with an average weight gain of more than 20 *jin* per head. Many cooperative members said, "With the realization of socialism, the oxen are also happy." Li Shaoqiu

　　Revival of an Ancient Well

　　The Nailin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiwang Township, Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, has reclaimed 200 *mu* of wasteland on the mountain, of which 60 *mu* have been turned into irrigated land. The tomatoes, bean pods, and other vegetables grown in the fields are growing very well. In addition to supplying vegetables for the cooperative members, they recently sold 2,000 *jin* of vegetables, earning 140 *yuan* in cash.

　　Turning wasteland into irrigated land in this arid mountainous area is no simple matter. One day last November, cooperative member Wang Xingliang was cutting firewood on Wolong Mountain when he came across a broken stone tablet. Based on the already blurred inscriptions on it, it could be recognized that this was a relic left by people when they burned kilns on Mantou Mountain and Wolong Mountain hundreds of years ago. Wang Xingliang had burned earthen urns in the past, and he knew that this kind of production could not be separated from water, and that there might be a water source nearby.

　　From then on, Wang Xingliang went to these two mountains every day to find water sources. One day, he discovered two large well openings. One was only a little over a foot deep due to siltation, and the other was a dark well shaft. He threw a stone down to find out that there was still water inside. Wang Xingliang was very happy and suggested that the cooperative renovate these two ancient wells. After measurement and renovation, the two wells have been repaired and equipped with waterwheels.

　　Ten Thousand *Mu* of Low-Lying Land No Longer Flooded

　　Xiejiaxiang Township in Sizhuang District, Ziyang County, Shandong Province, has nearly 10,000 *mu* of land, most of which is low-lying. Whenever the rainy season comes, the land is flooded with water that cannot be drained. Every year, at least 5,000 *mu* of land yields nothing. In the past, every rainy season, 40% of the farming households had to flee famine or beg for food in other places. Farmers often fought over draining the accumulated water. Last autumn and winter, after the entire township realized advanced cooperativization, it solved the problem of drainage that had never been solved before. The cooperative decided to use 6,400 workdays to dig a large 18-*li*-long ditch for drainage. After this project is completed, it can completely drain the accumulated water in the low-lying areas, ensuring an increase of 4.2 million *jin* of grain. The cooperative members were overjoyed when they heard this news.

　　After the drainage project started, the people of Sunjia and Caijiaxiang villages, who had previously fought over digging ditches, were now digging the same ditch shoulder to shoulder, launching a friendly competition, and completing the drainage ditch ahead of schedule.

　　After a heavy rain on June 26, the water in the low-lying areas of Xiejiaxiang Township was completely drained. Now the low-lying areas of the entire township have become fertile fields, and the millet, sorghum, corn, and beans are growing lush and green. According to the plan, this year's yield will be more than double that of last year.

    耕牛进了“疗养所”
    广东省连山县通儒乡第一农业社，共有耕牛二百四十头。由于牛棚距离草地较远（二十多里），放牧往返时间较长，牛吃草时间就相对减少，最多有五小时。因此，耕牛时饱时饥，有七十二条牛变得消瘦了。怎么办呢？经管理委员们商量，决定在离社十五里的山谷间的草地附近，建立一座“耕牛疗养所”。社里派了三个有经验的社员负责饲养管理。第一批把最瘦弱的二十七头耕牛送进“疗养所”去，每天放牧八小时，饲养员还经常给耕牛增加精饲料、洗澡、除治牛虱。经过两个多月的疗养，全部瘦牛变得又肥又胖，平均每头体重增加二十多斤。很多社员说：“实现了社会主义化，耕牛也是幸福的。”　李少球
    古井的复活
    山西省交城县义望乡奈林农业生产合作社，在山上开垦了二百亩荒地，其中有六十亩已经变成了水浇地。地里种的西红柿、豆荚等蔬菜生长得很好。除了供应社员们吃菜外，最近还卖了二千斤蔬菜，得到现款一百四十元。
    在这个干旱的高山地区，把荒地变成水浇地，可不是一件简单的事情。去年十一月的一天，社员王兴亮在卧牛山上砍柴，遇见一块缺边没角的石碑，根据上面已经模糊的字迹，可以认出这是几百年前人们在馒头山和卧牛山上烧窑时留下的遗址。王兴亮过去烧过瓦瓮，他知道这种生产不能离开水，这附近可能有水源。
    从此以后，王兴亮天天到这两座山上寻找水源。有一天，他发现了两个大井口。一个被泥淤的只有一尺多深，一个是黑洞洞的井筒子。扔下一块石头探知里面还有水呢。王兴亮非常高兴，建议合作社整修这两眼古井。经过测量、整修，两口井已经修好，并且装上了水车。

    万亩洼地不再涝
    山东省滋阳县泗庄区谢家乡有近万亩土地，多数是低洼地，每当雨季到来，遍地积水，无法排出，每年最少有五千亩土地颗粒不见。过去每年一到雨季，就有40％的农户得逃荒或到外地讨饭。农民经常为排除积水而打架。去年秋冬，全乡实现了高级合作化后，把从来没法解决的排涝问题解决了。社里决定用六千四百个工，挖一条十八里长的大沟排涝。这个工程完成后，可彻底排除洼地积水，保证增产四百二十万斤粮食。社员们听到这个消息后，欢腾起来了。
    排水工程开工后，孙家和蔡家巷两村原来曾为挖沟打架的群众，现在肩并肩地挖着同一条沟，展开着友谊竞赛，提前挖成了排水沟。
    六月二十六日，一场暴雨之后，谢家乡洼地里的水完全排光了。现在全乡洼地都变成了良田，谷子、高粱、玉米、豆子都长得绿油油的。按照计划，今年将比去年增产一倍多。
