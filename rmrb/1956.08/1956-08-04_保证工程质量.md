    "A project of the century, quality first," is a well-known slogan among construction and installation enterprises. However, since the beginning of this year, the number and severity of engineering quality accidents in many units have been increasing. For example, in the construction and installation enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, except for a few units, engineering quality accidents have been rising month by month in the first half of this year. The Shenyang Metallurgical Second Engineering Company, for projects it undertook this year from the start of construction to early June, had a total of seventy-one quality accidents, equivalent to 114.5% of the total number of quality accidents last year, and rework losses were more than double the total rework losses last year. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen units under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, in the first five months of this year, a total of 1,834 engineering quality accidents of varying sizes occurred, requiring rework for 1,344 items, resulting in a loss of 123,800 yuan. Such serious quality accidents deserve the close attention of all construction departments, construction units, and local Party committees, and effective measures should be taken quickly to reverse this unfavorable situation.
    Why are engineering quality accidents so serious in capital construction?
    This year, after opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, many departments have expanded the scale of construction, increased construction projects, accelerated the pace of construction, and strived to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is certainly good. However, some unit leaders, under the control of impatience, are greedy for quantity and speed in arranging and inspecting work, emphasizing only the completion of the construction progress and investment plans, neglecting or paying little attention to engineering quality. Some people even still think: "It is a mistake not to complete the progress plan, but it doesn't matter if the quality is a little worse." However, facts in recent years have proven that only by seeking more and faster on the basis of "good" is it a reliable method; if quality is neglected, it often not only fails to speed up the construction progress but also delays the completion time. A key project undertaken by the First Mining Engineering Company of Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation had its main plant delayed by half a month due to rework; after the batching trough was shut down due to a quality accident, it could not be continued for a long time. Can it be said that only progress is important and it doesn't matter if the quality is a little worse?
    Another reason for the increase in engineering quality accidents is the complacency of many construction units and construction enterprise staff. In the past few years, various construction enterprises have completed some important projects and accumulated some construction experience. However, some comrades have become proud because of this. Some construction enterprise leaders believe that "we have crossed the big rivers and seas (referring to having done some important projects), and cannot capsize in small rivers"; some units, after doing some civil construction projects, have neglected the complexity of industrial construction projects; more commonly, they look down on civil construction projects. These ideas have already caused many units to suffer. For example, the leaders of the Fifth Engineering Division of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau usually believe that "industrial construction projects and civil construction are almost the same," so they do not pay much attention to the quality of some factory buildings they undertake. Technical responsibility systems, quality inspection systems, etc., in this engineering division are not strictly enforced. As a result, serious quality accidents have occurred in some factory buildings and other projects they undertook. When the Fourth Engineering Company of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering was building twenty dormitories for a factory, the company leaders, because they had done large factory building projects, were indifferent to the twenty dormitory projects. They started construction in a hurry without careful preparation for construction. In the process of construction, they also one-sidedly greedily sought quantity and speed, and did not pay good attention to quality issues. As a result, these twenty dormitories, from the foundation to the brick walls, from the lintels to the beams, had quality accidents everywhere. These facts show that as long as one is arrogant and complacent, and negligent, it will cause losses to the country. In fact, the construction experience accumulated by various construction enterprises in the past few years is not much, and their technical level is not very high, while the progress of various construction technologies at home and abroad is changing rapidly, and there are often many new problems in new construction projects, so caution must be taken to avoid accidents. The Chinese saying "Complacency leads to loss, and humility benefits" should become the motto of construction and installation enterprises and construction units.
    Due to the insufficient supply of steel, cement, wood and other building materials, saving materials has become a major task for the construction sector this year. However, some units, when promoting measures to save materials, have placed "good" and "saving" in opposition to each other, emphasizing only saving while neglecting engineering quality, which is counterproductive. Of course, we must pay attention to saving at any time, and since the supply of materials is relatively tight this year, we should actively promote various effective saving measures and strive to complete the most projects with the least amount of materials; but at the same time, we must ensure that the quality of the project is good, not only to avoid quality accidents and waste, but also to ensure that all construction projects meet strict quality standards. That is to say, we must save materials on the basis of ensuring the quality of the project.
    In order to ensure the quality of the project, it is also necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers in the construction and installation enterprises to fight for the guarantee of project quality. At present, among the construction and installation workers, some people still do not fully recognize the importance of project quality and have a one-sided idea of rushing progress; at the same time, many workers are very dissatisfied with the leaders' practice of simply grasping progress, resulting in a lot of rework and waste. It is now very necessary to launch a major inspection of project quality among the broad masses of workers. Through this inspection, the shortcomings in quality can be exposed and the key to the problem can be found. This will play a major role in improving the leadership style and overcoming the leadership's mistakes in neglecting project quality in a timely manner. At the same time, this inspection can also stimulate everyone to learn design drawings and implement operating procedures in a responsible manner to ensure quality through criticism and self-criticism of the workers themselves.
    Of course, the problem of project quality cannot be completely solved by a mass quality inspection, and there is still a need for regular systems to guarantee it. First of all, after the major quality inspection, a mass self-inspection system and quality scoring system can be established and improved, so that the broad masses of workers can regularly supervise each other and effectively ensure project quality. At the same time, the construction department should quickly establish and strictly implement a quality reward and punishment system; the objects of rewards and punishments should include leaders at all levels of the company, work area, work section, and construction site. Leaders of construction and installation enterprises must firmly establish the concept of ensuring project quality. In addition, the establishment and improvement of a technical responsibility system and strengthening of technical supervision are also necessary measures to ensure project quality.
    The third quarter, which is already the peak of construction every year, has now arrived, and effectively guaranteeing project quality is an urgent issue. It is hoped that all construction units, construction enterprises, and local Party committees will immediately take action to overcome various ideological obstacles and take various effective measures to complete this year's capital construction tasks with greater, faster, better and more economical results on a good foundation.

### 保证工程质量

    保证工程质量
    “百年大计，质量第一”，这是建筑安装企业中人所共知的口号。可是，今年以来，许多单位的工程质量事故却愈来愈多和愈来愈严重了。例如，冶金工业部的建筑安装企业，除少数单位以外，今年上半年工程质量事故都在逐月上升。沈阳冶金第二工程公司所承担的工程，今年从开工到六月上旬止，共发生了七十一次质量事故，相当于去年全年质量事故总次数的114.5％，返工损失比去年全年返工损失多一倍多。建筑工程部据十五个单位的不完全统计，今年前五个月，共发生大小工程质量事故1，834次，需要返工的有1，344件，损失12.38万元。这样严重的质量事故，值得引起各个建设部门、施工部门和各地党委的密切注意，迅速采取有效措施，扭转这种不利的局面。
    为什么基本建设中工程质量事故这样严重呢？
    今年在反对右倾保守思想以后，许多部门扩大了建设规模，增加了工程项目，加快了工程进度，争取提早完成第一个五年计划。这当然是很好的。但是有些单位的领导人员在急躁情绪的支配下，在布置和检查工作的时候贪多贪快，只强调完成工程进度和投资计划，忽视或者很少注意工程质量。有的人甚至现在还认为：“完不成进度计划是犯错误，质量差点没关系。”但是几年来的事实证明，只有在“好”的基础上求多、求快，才是可靠的办法；如果忽视质量，往往不但不能加快工程进度，反而会推迟完工时间。鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司第一矿山工程公司担负的某项重点工程，主厂房就因为返工而拖迟工期半个月；配料槽因为质量事故停工以后，长时间无法继续施工。这能说只有进度重要而质量差点也没关系吗？
    工程质量事故增加的另一个原因，是许多建设单位和建筑企业的工作人员有骄傲自满情绪。几年来，各建筑企业建成了一些重要工程，也积累了一些建设经验。但是，有些同志却因此骄傲起来了。有些建筑企业的领导人员认为“大江大海都走过了（指做过一些重要工程），小河沟里翻不了船”；有的单位做过一些民用建筑工程以后，竟忽视了工业建设工程的复杂性；更普遍的，是看不起民用建筑工程。这些想法，已经使许多单位吃了苦头。例如，华北太原工程局第五工程处的领导人员平时认为“工业建设工程和民用建筑也差不多”，因此对他们所承担的一些厂房工程的质量很不重视，这个工程处里的技术责任制、质量检查制等都没有严格执行。结果，他们承担的一些厂房等工程发生了严重的质量事故。建筑工程部中南工程管理总局第四工程公司在为某厂建筑二十栋宿舍的时候，公司领导人员因为做过大厂房工程，对二十栋宿舍工程满不在乎。没有认真进行施工准备就仓促全面开工，在施工过程中，也片面地贪多图快，没有很好地注意质量问题。结果，这二十栋宿舍，从基础到砖墙，从过梁到大梁，到处发生了质量事故。这些事实说明，只要骄傲自满，疏忽大意，就会给国家造成损失。其实，各个建筑企业在过去几年中积累起来的建设经验并不是很多的，他们的技术水平也并不算高，而国内外各种建筑技术的进展却是日新月异的，在新的工程项目中也往往存在着许多新的问题，必须谨慎从事才能避免事故。中国古语说的“满招损，谦受益”，应该成为建筑安装企业和建设单位的座右铭。
    由于钢材、水泥、木材等建筑材料供应不足，节约材料成了今年建筑部门的一项重大任务。但是，有些单位在推广节约材料的措施的时候，把“好”和“省”对立起来，只强调节约，却忽视了工程质量，这是得不偿失的。当然，我们在任何时候都要注意节约，今年材料的供应既然比较紧张，就更应该积极推广各种有效的节约措施，争取用最少的材料完成最多的工程；但同时又必须保证把工程质量搞好，不仅要避免发生质量事故，造成浪费，而且必须使所有的建设工程符合严格的质量标准。这也就是说，一定要在保证工程质量的基础上节约材料。
    为了保证工程的质量，还需要发动建筑安装企业的广大职工来为保证工程质量而斗争。目前，建筑安装工人当中，一部分人对于工程质量的重要性还认识不足，存在着片面赶进度的思想；同时，许多职工对于领导人员单纯抓进度，以致造成大量返工浪费的作法是很不满意的。现在很有必要发动广大职工进行一次工程质量大检查。通过这次检查，可以揭发出质量方面存在的缺点，找出问题的关键。这对改进领导作风，及时克服领导方面忽视工程质量的错误将起重大作用。同时，这种检查，也可以通过职工群众自己的批评和自我批评，激发大家以主人翁的态度来学习设计图纸，贯彻执行操作规程，以保证质量。
    当然，工程质量问题不能完全靠一次群众性的质量大检查来解决，还需要有经常的制度加以保证。首先，在质量大检查以后，就可以建立和健全群众性的自检制度和质量评分制度，使广大职工能经常彼此督促，切实保证工程质量。同时，建筑部门要迅速建立并严格执行质量奖惩制度；奖惩的对象，应该包括公司、工区、工段、工地的各级领导人员。建筑安装企业的领导人员要切实树立起保证工程质量的观念。此外，像建立和健全技术专责制度，加强技术监督等，也是保证工程质量的必要措施。
    目前已经进入每年施工高峰的第三季度，切实设法保证工程质量，已是迫不及待的问题。希望各建设单位、各建筑企业和各地党委立即行动起来，克服各种思想障碍，采取各种有效措施，以便在好的基础上又多又快又省地完成今年的基本建设任务。
