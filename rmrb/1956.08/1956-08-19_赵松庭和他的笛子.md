    Zhao Songting and His Flute
    Shen Ding
    At a recent concert during the First National Music Week, a simple young man, carrying a bamboo flute over two feet long, walked alone onto the stage. He held the flute horizontally to his lips:
    The flute music started softly, first depicting a scene of the Jiangnan countryside: early spring morning, the sun rising, birds singing, and all things awakening in the embrace of nature. The flute music grew from weak to strong, featuring a light and lively rhythm, as if someone were irresistibly dancing in this charming spring scenery. The flute music then lowered, the dancer moving away, and all things returned to tranquility.
    The flute music stopped, but the entire audience remained focused and held their breath, savoring the lingering sound, as if watching a wisp of morning glow floating in the sky fade into the distance.
    This young man playing the bamboo flute was Zhao Songting from the Zhejiang delegation, and the piece he played was his own composition, "Morning."
    "Morning" was written in the spring of 1954, when the author was still a literary and artistic soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This piece was his attempt to write music that expresses the beautiful life of the people. Over the past two years, it has been played three or four hundred times for Chinese and foreign audiences, and the piece has been revised hundreds of times.
    Zhao Songting has loved folk music since he was a child and can play many musical instruments. Later, he also learned several foreign musical instruments. He likes the bamboo flute the most. For twenty years, he has worked tirelessly, mastered many superb traditional techniques, and absorbed some of the strengths of Western flute playing methods, forming a unique set of skills.
    "Morning" is a relatively long piece, lasting about four minutes. According to the general playing method, the performer would have to stop in the middle to catch their breath and then continue playing. Zhao Songting, however, used the breathing method of playing the suona (inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth simultaneously), never interrupting the flute sound when breathing. He told reporters that when he first used this method, he couldn't even make the flute sound at all. It only succeeded after a long period of practice.
    At the request of reporters, he took out a bamboo flute and demonstrated several original techniques. The flute sound was sometimes soft and sometimes heavy, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, like flowing clouds and flowing water, changing in an instant.
    The flute was being controlled by Zhao Songting at will.

    赵松庭和他的笛子
    沈鼎
    第一届全国音乐周最近的一次音乐会上，一个朴素的青年人带着一支二尺多长的竹笛，独自走上了舞台。他把笛子横在唇边：
    笛声轻轻地起来了，先给人们描画了一幅江南田野的风景：初春早晨，太阳初升、小鸟啼鸣，万物都在大自然的怀抱里苏醒。笛声由弱转强，出现了轻快、跳耀的节奏，好像有人在这迷人的春光里情不自禁地跳起舞来了。笛声又低下去，舞蹈的人走远了，万物也恢复平静。
    笛声住了，可是全场听众还凝神屏息，回味着那绕耳余音，好像在目送一缕浮在天际的朝霞远去一样。
    这个吹竹笛的青年是浙江代表团的赵松庭，他吹奏的曲子是自己创作的“早晨”。
    “早晨”写在1954年春天，那时作者还是中国人民志愿军部队里的一个文艺战士。这支曲子是他写作表现人民美好生活的乐曲的一次尝试，两年多来，曾经为中、外听众吹奏过三、四百次，对这支曲子也作了上百次的修改。
    赵松庭从小就热爱民间音乐，会演奏许多乐器，后来又学习了好几种外国乐器。他最喜欢竹笛，二十年来，下了无数苦功，掌握了许多高超的传统技法，并且吸收了西洋长笛吹奏方法的某些长处，形成一套独创的技巧。
    “早晨”是一支相当长的曲子，吹奏时间要四分钟左右。按照一般吹奏方法，演奏者将不得不在中间停顿下来换了气再吹。赵松庭却运用了吹唢呐换气的方法（鼻吸、嘴呼同时进行），换气时也从不使笛声中断。他对记者说，最初用这办法的时候，根本连笛子都吹不响，经过长时期的练习才成功。
    应记者的请求，他取过一支竹笛，表演了几个独创的技巧。笛声忽轻忽重，忽快忽慢，犹如行云流水，瞬息万变。
    笛子，被赵松庭随心所欲地控制着。
