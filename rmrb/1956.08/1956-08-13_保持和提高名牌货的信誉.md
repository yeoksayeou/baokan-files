Maintaining and Improving the Reputation of Brand-Name Goods

On August 8th, Zhejiang Daily published an editorial entitled "Maintaining and Improving the Reputation of Brand-Name Goods." The editorial stated that among Zhejiang's industrial products, some are brand-name goods. Since liberation, many brand-name goods have maintained their original reputation, and some have even improved. However, many brand-name products have also experienced a decline in quality and a reduction in variety. For example, Shaoxing rice wine is one of China's famous wines, known for its mellow taste and excellent color and aroma, with more than ten varieties. However, in recent years, Shaoxing wine has become less mellow and fragrant, with only three varieties remaining, and the packaging is crude, prone to leakage, and does not allow for long storage.

The main reason for this situation is that some people have a very confused view: brand-name goods are high-end consumer products, serving the ruling class, so now we should no longer produce brand-name goods, but should produce "mass-market goods" for the workers and peasants. They have not thought carefully about the fact that brand-name goods are famous far and wide precisely because the people need them and like them. To eliminate brand-name goods is precisely a manifestation of a lack of a mass perspective.

The editorial stated that maintaining the original production techniques and management methods of brand-name goods is the key to maintaining the quality and variety of brand-name goods. For example, the reason why Shaoxing wine is good is because it pays attention to the selection of materials. The glutinous rice used is refined and free of impurities, the formula is reasonable, and a certain amount of material produces a certain amount of wine, without unilaterally pursuing output. However, since liberation, some comrades have not only neglected the selection of materials and formulas, but also, under the slogan of "saving grain and increasing the rate of alcohol production," arbitrarily reduced the amount of materials used, added more water, and produced more wine, resulting in two consecutive batches of bad wine, which ruined the reputation of Shaoxing wine.

The editorial stated that not only should attention be paid to maintaining the original excellent production techniques of brand-name goods, but also active and planned technical transformation should be carried out to improve the technical level, so that the production and product quality of brand-name goods can be continuously developed and improved. In this regard, some comrades also have serious right-leaning conservative tendencies. Zhejiang's silk and satin are famous, but the refining, dyeing, and printing equipment is very backward; the entire province's velvet dyeing workshops are all operated manually, and the printing of silk and satin patterns still uses ancient methods.

The editorial pointed out that the failure to implement the principle of pricing based on quality in the past is also one of the reasons why the advantages of some brand-name goods have not been maintained and developed. For example, the price of Zhou Yunji Xinji Shaoxing wine used to be three or four times higher than that of ordinary yellow wine, and it was still in short supply in the market. The purchase price of Zhang Xiaoquan Jinji scissors was also about 25% higher than that of ordinary Hangzhou scissors. However, since liberation, the same price has been given regardless of the quality of the product. Workers criticized this pricing policy as "cooking good and bad sweet potatoes in the same pot," which frustrated the enthusiasm of enterprises to produce brand-name goods.

The editorial concluded by saying that to maintain and improve the reputation of brand-name goods, in addition to the efforts of industrial departments, it is also necessary to rely on the cooperation, coordination, and support of various relevant economic departments. Supply departments should ensure the supply of good raw materials according to the needs of the products; the tax burden on brand-name goods should also be reasonably adjusted.

### 保持和提高名牌货的信誉

    保持和提高名牌货的信誉
    八月八日，浙江日报发表了一篇题为“保持和提高名牌货的信誉”的社论。社论里说，在浙江的工业品中，有一部分是名牌货。解放以后，有不少名牌货保持了原有的信誉，有的还提高了。但是，也有不少的名牌产品，质量下降，品种减少。例如，绍兴老酒是我国名酒之一，味醇和，色、香亦佳，品种多至十多种。但是近几年来，绍兴酒味不醇不香，品种只剩下三种，而且包装简陋，容易渗漏，储藏时间不长。
    产生这种情况，主要是有些人有一种十分糊涂的观点：名牌货是高级消费品，是为统治阶级服务的，因此现在不应当再生产名牌货，而应当生产为工农群众服务的“大路货”。他们没有好好想一想，名牌货所以远近闻名，正是因为人民需要它、欢喜它，取消名牌货，正是没有群众观点的表现。
    社论说，保持名牌货原有的生产技术和经营方式，是保持名牌货质量和品种的关键。比如绍兴酒所以好，是因为讲究选料，所用的糯米精白又没有杂质，配方合理，一定数量的料，出一定数量的酒，不片面追求产量。但是，解放以后，有些同志不仅不讲究选料、配方，而且在“节约粮食、提高出酒率”的口号下面，随意减少投料份量，多掺水，多出酒，结果连续出了两批坏酒，使绍兴酒信誉扫地。
    社论说，不但要注意保持名牌货原有的优良的生产技术，而且要积极地有计划地进行技术改造，提高技术水平，使名牌货的生产和产品质量不断地得到发展和提高。在这方面，有些同志也有严重的右倾保守倾向。浙江的绸缎是出名的，但是炼染和印染的设备非常落后；全省经绒染坊，全部是手工操作，绸缎花板的印染，仍沿用古老的办法。
    社论指出，过去没有实行按质论价的原则，也是使某些名牌货的优点未能保持和发展的原因之一。如过去的周云集信记绍兴酒，比一般黄酒的价格高三、四倍，市场上还供不应求。张小泉近记的剪刀，收购价格也比一般杭剪高出25％左右。但是解放以后，不分产品优劣，都给一样的价钱。工人批评这种价格政策是“好坏番薯一锅子煮”，挫折了企业生产名牌货的积极性。
    社论最后说，要保持和提高名牌货的信誉，除了工业部门的努力外，还要依靠各个有关经济部门的协作、配合和支持。供应部门应当根据产品的需要，保证供应好的原料；对名牌货的税负也应当加以合理的调整。
