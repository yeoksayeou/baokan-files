Xinhua News Agency, August 19th:

    The dried Brucella live vaccine for preventing brucellosis (undulant fever) has been successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products under the Ministry of Health. The institute has recently produced over 70,000 doses of this vaccine and the same amount of brucellin for diagnosing the disease. This batch of products will first be used for preventive inoculation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where brucellosis is prevalent.
    Brucellosis is prevalent among humans and livestock in various countries around the world, and its treatment methods are still under research. Humans are mainly infected with this disease through contact with cattle, sheep, pigs, and other livestock suffering from abortion disease (i.e., brucellosis in livestock) or by drinking their milk. It is a chronic disease, and its diagnosis must be confirmed through laboratory tests to distinguish it from other diseases. In the early stages, patients experience fever, headaches, and loss of appetite, which later turn into joint pain. Although their appetite remains good, they feel weak in their limbs and are unable to work. This disease is prevalent in pastoral areas, rural areas, slaughterhouses, and the food industry, and has a serious impact on livestock and agricultural production and people's health. Before liberation, China had not carried out any prevention measures against this disease. In recent years, due to the development of China's animal husbandry, the spread of this disease has also expanded.
    In 1955, the Ministry of Health specially organized an investigation team to conduct a survey on this disease in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and instructed the Beijing Institute of Biological Products to begin trial-producing the Brucella vaccine for preventing this disease.
    The Beijing Institute of Biological Products referred to Soviet data and manufacturing methods in trial-producing this vaccine and conducted research and experiments for more than a year. The trial-produced vaccine has been used for inoculation on a portion of people in Beijing, and it has been proven to have a certain efficacy.

    布氏杆菌菌苗试制成功
    新华社19日讯　预防布氏杆菌病（波浪热）的干燥布氏杆菌活菌苗，已经由卫生部北京生物制品研究所试制成功。研究所最近已生产出这种菌苗七万多人份和同样数量的用来诊断这种病的布氏菌素。这批产品将先在布氏杆菌病流行的内蒙古自治区试行预防接种。
    布氏杆菌病在世界各国人、畜中都有流行，它的治疗方法还在研究中。人类感染这种病主要是由于和患流产病（即牲畜身上的布氏杆菌病）的牛、羊、猪等牲畜接触或者喝了它们的奶引起的。这是一种慢性病，它的诊断必须经过化验才能与其他病区别。患者初期是发烧、头疼、食欲不振，以后又转变成关节疼，食欲虽好，但四肢无力，无法进行劳动。这种病多流行在牧区、农村、屠宰场、食品工业中，对牧、农业生产和人民健康都有严重的影响。解放前，我国对这种病根本没有进行过预防。近几年来，由于我国畜牧事业的发展，这种病的流传也随着有了扩大。
    1955年，卫生部特组织调查队去内蒙古自治区对这种病进行了调查，同时责成北京生物制品研究所开始试制预防这种病的布氏杆菌菌苗。
    北京生物制品研究所试制这种菌苗参照苏联的资料和制造方法，并经过了一年多的研究试验。试制出来的菌苗曾经在北京作过一部分人的接种，证明有一定的功效。
