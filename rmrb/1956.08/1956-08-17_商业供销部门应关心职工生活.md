Commercial Supply and Marketing Departments Should Care About the Lives of Employees

No Place to Work or Sleep
	The thirty employees of the Huizhou Branch of the China Cultural Goods Company in Guangdong Province are crowded into a room of only fifty-odd square meters. They have tried every possible way to fit twenty-three desks into the room. Even so, some comrades still have no desk to work at. The weather is hot now, and everyone is squeezed into one room, truly like dumplings in a steamer. As a result, people are getting sick every day, and the number of sick people is increasing day by day.
	Although we have tried in many ways to rent a few rooms or build a few rooms ourselves, it has not been resolved. The reason is that the houses in Huizhou Town are under the unified control of the local government, and we cannot rent them; if we want to build a house, the higher authorities will not allocate funds.
		(Lai Zhaoxing Xu Yongbin)
	The Tangyin County Company of the China Department Store has fifty-five employees, but they only have twelve rooms for both offices and dormitories. With so many people and so few rooms, they have no fixed place to work or sleep. In some rooms, people are working on one side while others are sleeping on the other. The cook and the clerk have no place to live, so they have to sleep in the kitchen. In this hot weather, the fire in the kitchen is truly unbearable. The worst thing is the women's toilet, which has only one pit. People often have to queue to use the toilet, and the roof leaks when it rains.
	In addition to the department store company, other commercial departments in Tangyin County, such as the Coal and Construction Company and the Monopoly Company, are in the same situation. Because there are not enough dormitories, the male and female staff of the Monopoly Company have to sleep in the same room. When the families of the Coal and Construction Company's employees come to visit, they have to find their own housing outside. Therefore, some employees say: "We are like footballs, kicked wherever we land, and every day is like two."

Welfare Funds Are Not Being Used Effectively
	The wages of employees in the supply and marketing cooperative system in Hebei Province are generally very low, and their lives are relatively difficult. However, the administration is indifferent to the hardships of the employees and accumulates a large amount of welfare funds. For example, Chen Wugui of the Chengguan Cooperative in Fucheng County has six children and a monthly salary of only more than 27 yuan, making life quite difficult. However, because the welfare funds are controlled too strictly, he dares not apply for subsidies. Some employees of the Yingshouyingzi Cooperative in Xinglong County are in difficulty, but no one has received a subsidy this year. At the same time, because there are many levels managing welfare funds, employees' requests cannot be approved in a timely manner. For example, the report of employees of the Xinglong County grassroots cooperative applying for subsidies was sent to the county, but the finance and accounting section and the cadre section shirked responsibility to each other, and it has not been approved for two or three months.

### 商业供销部门应关心职工生活

    商业供销部门应关心职工生活
    办公睡觉无处去
    中国文化用品公司广东惠阳分公司三十名职工，挤在一个五十来平方公尺的屋子里办公，想尽了办法才在屋子里放下了二十三张办公桌子。就这样有的同志还是没有桌子办公。现在天气炎热，大家挤在一个屋子里，真像是蒸笼里的包子。因此每天都有人生病，病号一天天增多。
    虽然我们曾多方设法想租几间或自己修建几间房子，但一直得不到解决。原因是惠州镇的房子由当地政府统一掌握，我们无法租到；要修房子，上级又不拨款。
              （赖兆兴　徐涌彬）
    中国百货公司汤阴县公司有五十五个工作同志，可是连办公室带宿舍只有十二间房子。人多房子少，他们办公和睡觉都没有固定的地方。有的房子里一面有人在办公，一面有人在睡觉。炊事员、事务长没地方住，就只好在伙房里睡觉。在这大热天，伙房里的火真叫人烤的受不了。最糟糕的是女厕所，只有一个毛坑，上厕所常常要排队，下雨屋内还漏雨。
    除百货公司外，汤阴县的其他商业部门，如煤建公司、专卖公司的情况也是如此。因为宿舍不够，专卖公司的男女工作人员只好睡在一个屋子里。煤建公司职工的家属来了，只有自己设法在外面找房子住。所以有的职工说：“我们是皮球，踢到哪里算哪里，过一天算两晌。”
                        （李庆）
    福利金使不上劲
    河北省供销合作社系统职工的工资一般都很低，生活也比较困难。但是，行政上对职工疾苦却漠不关心，把大批福利金积压着。如阜城县城关社陈五贵，有六个小孩，每月工资只有二十七元多，生活相当困难，但因福利金掌握过严，不敢申请补助。兴隆县鹰手营子社的一些职工有困难，今年还没有一个人得到过补助。同时，因掌握管理福利金的层次多，职工有所请求，也不能得到及时批复。如兴隆县基层社职工申请补助的报告送到县里后，财会科和干部科互相推诿，两三个月都没批下去。　（姜恩普）
