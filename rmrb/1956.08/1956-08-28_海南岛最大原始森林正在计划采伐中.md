Haikou Dispatch, August 27th: The largest virgin forest on Hainan Island, Jianfengling, is planned to be logged. Jianfengling is located in Dongfang County, near the southwest coast, with an elevation of 1,390 meters above sea level. The forest area covers 43,424 hectares and is the largest virgin forest in Hainan. During the day, when people venture deep into this virgin forest, even sunlight is obscured. Ancient trees reach for the sky everywhere, with the oldest trees being five to six hundred years old, and general timber trees having sixty or more annual rings. It contains nationally renowned Qingmei trees, as well as over twenty kinds of precious timber such as bamboo leaf pine, Masson pine, Rouge wood, Green Nanmu, Oil Nanmu, Kuzi, Red Luo, and Rosewood. These timbers are the best materials for constructing houses, bridges, ships, airplanes, railway sleepers, and mine pit props. Its fibers can also be used to manufacture rayon, cellophane, photographic film, and alcohol.

According to a preliminary survey by the Guangdong Forestry Survey Team, the confirmed timber reserve of this virgin forest is over 10.04 million cubic meters. If logging is fully mechanized, with an annual harvest of 100,000 to 200,000 cubic meters, it can be logged for twenty-five to thirty years. The amount of timber extracted would be more than 4.3 million cubic meters. If made into sleepers, it would be enough to pave approximately 22 and a half Chengdu-Chongqing Railways. Therefore, after logging the Jianfengling virgin forest, Hainan Island will no longer need to import more than 30,000 cubic meters of timber annually from various parts of the mainland, and can also export a total of more than 2.6 million cubic meters of timber to support construction in other parts of the country.

Currently, the plan for logging the Jianfengling virgin forest has been preliminarily drafted by the Hainan Branch of the Guangdong Forestry Industry Bureau and will be officially implemented next year. In the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, logging operations can be mechanized on a large scale.

### 海南岛最大原始森林正在计划采伐中

    海南岛最大原始森林正在计划采伐中
    本报海口27日电　海南岛最大的尖峰岭原始森林已计划开伐。尖峰岭位于东方县，靠近西南海岸，拔海一千三百九十公尺，林地面积有四万三千四百二十四公顷，是海南最大的原始森林。白天，人们走进这座原始森林的深处，连阳光也看不见。到处古树参天，最老的树有五、六百年，一般用材树也有六十年以上的年轮。这里蕴藏着全国闻名的青梅树和竹叶松、马尾松、胭脂、绿楠、油楠、苦梓、红罗、花梨等二十多种名贵木材。这些木材都是建造房屋、桥梁、船只、飞机、铁道枕木、矿山坑木的最好木材。它的纤维还可以制造人造丝、玻璃纸、照相软片和酒精等。
    据广东林野调查队初步勘查，证实这座原始森林的蓄积量有一千零四十多万立方公尺。如果采伐全部机械化，每年采伐十万到二十万立方公尺，可以采伐二十五年到三十年。采伐出来的木材量将有四百三十多万立方公尺。如果制成枕木，差不多可以铺筑二十二条半的成渝铁路。因此，开伐尖峰岭原始森林后，海南岛就不必每年从大陆各地运进三万多立方公尺的木材，而且共可外调二百六十多万立方公尺的木材支援祖国各地建设。
    现在，采伐尖峰岭原始森林的计划已由广东森林工业局海南分局初步拟定，明年正式开始实行。在第二个五年计划的头一年，采伐工作即可大规模机械化。
