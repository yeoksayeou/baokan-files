Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: In order to make up for the losses caused by waterlogging, farmers in the Huai River region of Henan and Anhui provinces are actively adopting methods of rushing to plant, replant, interplant, and intercrop, as well as strengthening field management, under the slogans of "lose in summer, retrieve in autumn" and "what the rain took away, we will fight to get back from the land," striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

Henan Province has already planted 70% of the planned late autumn crops. Various counties in the Xinyang Special District have also formulated production increase plans, preparing to increase grain output by 680 million jin through expanding the planting area of both paddy and dryland rice, and planting more high-yield crops. At the same time, these counties have also formulated plans for developing sideline production.

In Anhui Province, the masses in the flood-stricken areas are vigorously draining water and rushing to plant. The party and government leading organs in Chu County have issued a call to farmers throughout the county to increase grain production by 50 million jin. Huaiyuan County has currently intercropped 260,000 mu of late autumn crops, and has also planted 200,000 mu of sweet potatoes and 230,000 mu of late rice, which is expected to increase grain production by more than 210 million jin.

    河南安徽抢种补种晚秋作物
    新华社31日讯　河南、安徽两省沿淮河地区的农民，为了弥补水涝减产损失，正在“夏季丢，秋季捞”，“天雨夺了去，地上争回来”的口号下，积极采取抢种、补种、间种、套种和加强田间管理的办法，争取秋季丰收。
    河南省已经抢种的晚秋作物达到原计划的70％。信阳专区的各个县还制定了增产计划，准备从扩大水旱稻的播种面积和多种高产作物中增收六亿八千万斤粮食。同时这些县还制定了发展副业生产的计划。
    安徽省水灾地区群众正在大力排水抢种。滁县党政领导机关已向全县农民提出增产五千万斤粮食的号召。怀远县目前已经套种晚秋作物二十六万亩，另外种植了甘薯二十万亩，晚稻二十三万亩，预计可增收粮食二亿一千多万斤。
