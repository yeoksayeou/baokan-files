    Unable to Buy Milk Powder Measuring Spoon
    Recently, I bought a bottle of "Guangming Brand" milk powder. Because I don't use milk powder often, I couldn't accurately measure the portion. Coincidentally, the milk powder instructions stated: "Use the Guangming Milk Powder standard measuring spoon as the standard... available for purchase at all distributors." I immediately went to the market to inquire, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I don't know if the Shanghai Yimin Food Factory, which produces "Guangming Brand" milk powder, didn't produce milk powder measuring spoons, or if the commercial departments didn't pay attention to distributing this product.

    买不到奶粉量匙
    最近我买了一瓶“光明牌”奶粉，因为不常用奶粉，份量掌握不准，恰好奶粉说明上写着：“以光明奶粉标准量匙为准……可向各经销处购买。”我马上到市场去询问，结果什么地方都没有买到。不知道是生产“光明牌”奶粉的上海益民食品工厂没有生产奶粉量匙呢，还是商业部门没有注意经销这种产品。　（魏强）
