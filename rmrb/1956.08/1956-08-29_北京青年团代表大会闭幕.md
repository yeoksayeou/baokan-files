Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: "Strengthening ideological education within the League and overcoming simplistic and rigid working styles" was one of the central issues discussed at the closing of the Fourth Beijing Youth League Congress today.

The meeting considered that, during the high tide of the socialist revolution, League organizations had relatively focused on conducting communist education among young people around various central tasks. However, for a period, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League emphasized engaging in independent activities, neglecting leadership over ideological education work.

Many representatives, in their speeches, raised criticisms and constructive suggestions regarding this issue. Everyone believed that many League leaders and grassroots League organizations generally had crude, simplistic, and rigid working methods when conducting ideological education, which affected the enthusiasm and initiative of young people, preventing it from being fully utilized.

The representatives also believed that the number of League members in joint state-private enterprises, handicrafts, and rural areas had developed rapidly, but basic League knowledge education and ideological education had not kept up. Therefore, strengthening the training of these League cadres and the education of League members is an urgent task at present.

The meeting pointed out that educating young people is the task of the entire League, and it is necessary to use different methods to educate young people on different issues that arise under different conditions. At present, it is particularly necessary to educate young people to love their work, to educate them in the revolutionary traditions of hard struggle, and to educate them to boldly create and think independently in their work.

Before the meeting closed today, the new Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and delegates to the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League were elected.

    北京青年团代表大会闭幕
    新华社27日讯　“加强团的思想教育，克服简单生硬的工作作风”是今天闭幕的青年团北京市第四次代表大会上讨论的中心问题之一。
    会议认为，在社会主义革命高潮中，团组织围绕各项中心工作比较集中地向青年进行了共产主义教育。但有一个时期，团市委强调抓独立活动，忽略了对思想教育工作的领导。
    许多代表在发言中对这一问题提出了批评和建设性的意见。大家认为，不少团的领导及团的基层组织，在进行思想教育时，相当普遍地存在着粗暴、简单、生硬的工作方法，影响了青年的积极性和主动性不能充分发挥。
    代表们还认为，公私合营企业、手工业和农村中团员的数量发展很快，团的基本知识教育和思想教育没有跟上去。因此，加强对这些团干部的培养训练及团员的教育，是当前的迫切任务。
    会议指出，教育青年是全团的任务，必须对不同条件的青年所发生的不同问题，用不同的方式去进行教育。目前特别需要对青年进行热爱自己工作的教育、进行艰苦奋斗的革命传统的教育，还要教育青年大胆创造和独立思考地去进行劳动。
    在今天会议闭幕前，选出了新的青年团北京市委员会和出席青年团第三次全国代表大会的代表。
