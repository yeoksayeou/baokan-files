Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 18th: Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu said on August 17th that he requested his colleagues to relieve him of his position as Chairman at the next congress of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The congress is scheduled to be held in January next year.

U Nu expressed his intention in a speech to trainee journalists at the School of Journalism attached to the Burma Translation Association. He said the Executive Committee of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League would decide whether to accept his resignation. He also said, "I do not want to be a 'professional chairman', like the chairmen of many organizations who continue to serve as chairman for many years."

U Nu said that if he resigned as chairman, he would be willing to engage in writing because he "yearns to be a writer."

U Nu asked journalists to cooperate with him in the task of eliminating bad elements in the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. He said, "In fact, I resigned from the post of Prime Minister in order to devote all my time to this task."

He pointed out, however, that no one can hope to accomplish this task alone: "This requires a united, cooperative effort, which is why I ask the press for active support and cooperation."

    缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟
    吴努主席表示将辞职
    新华社仰光18日电　缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努在八月十七日说，他要求他的同僚在反法西斯人民自由同盟召开下次大会的时候解除他的主席职务。这次大会预定在明年一月举行。
    吴努在附属于缅甸翻译协会的新闻记者学校向受训的新闻记者发表的演说中说出了他的意图。他说反法西斯人民自由同盟执行委员会将决定接受还是不接受他的辞职。他又说，“我不愿意当一个‘职业主席’，像许多组织的主席那样，继续多年担任主席”。
    吴努说，假如他辞掉了主席职务，他将愿意从事写作，因为他“热望做一个作家。”
    吴努要求新闻记者在消除反法西斯人民自由同盟中的坏分子的任务中同他合作。他说，“实际上，我辞掉总理的职务，就是为了可以献出我的全部时间来从事这个任务。”
    他指出，但是任何人都不能希望能够单独完成这个任务：“这需要联合的、合作的努力、这就是我为什么要求报界进行积极支持和合作的原因”。
