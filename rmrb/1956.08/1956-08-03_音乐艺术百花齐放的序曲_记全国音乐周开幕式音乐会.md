    Overture to the Flourishing of Musical Arts
    ——A Record of the Opening Ceremony Concert of the National Music Week
    By Zhu Shulan
    On the evening of August 1st, the first National Music Week opened in Beijing.
    Look, seated on the rostrum are music workers from various regions, dozens of leading figures promoting the development of our music cause. Some are bustling about to discover and preserve the excellent heritage of national and folk music, some are busy extensively and deeply exerting the combat role of musical art, and some are diligently learning the musical language of the people, preparing to better sing of the new society and the new life. And there are so many singers and performers, some from the folk, some from the opera stage, some from musical organizations..., but their songs and music are equally loved and welcomed by the people, inspiring the people's fighting spirit.
    The opening ceremony concert, symbolizing the "blooming of a hundred flowers" in musical art, contains such rich content! Songs praising the motherland resounded, expressing the people's enthusiasm for building socialism. Workers are the pioneers of a beautiful and happy life, and farmers have seen that "the cooperative is the great road to heaven"; our next generation, the children, are happily playing in joyful days. All this would not have been possible without the leadership of the Communist Party and the arduous Long March of the Red Army. Musicians have not forgotten the days of suffering, have not forgotten the pioneers of the New Music Movement, who once so bravely grasped their weapons and sounded the battle horn for the independence of the motherland and the awakening of the people. Xian Xinghai's "Yellow River Cantata" still shakes our hearts today. Nie Er's "New Woman", Liu Tianhua's "Brightness", Huang Zi's "Song of Resistance" and "Our Flag is Flying"... at that time, these songs and music powerfully called for women to break away from the shackles of feudal families and society, urging them to stand up straight and live like human beings; they also reflected the infinite yearning of young people and intellectuals for a bright future; and even more aroused the hatred of the people across the country for the imperialist invaders and reactionary rulers, and their patriotic enthusiasm. The days when the people were enslaved and oppressed are gone forever.
    In the fertile soil of Chinese musical art, countless diligent cultivators have created diverse and beautiful forms since ancient times to reflect the people's thoughts and feelings and satisfy their different preferences. Nie Er's "Golden Snake Dance," adapted from the folk tune "Ba Ban," vividly and lively depicts the joyous scenes of the folk. The ancient music "Pu An Zhou" brings a peaceful and serene atmosphere. Mongolian folk songs, Kazakh folk songs, and Qinghai folk songs, although produced by different ethnic groups in very distant regions, do they not equally deeply infect the audience? Those choral forms and piano suites that have only been introduced to our country in recent decades have also gradually become familiar and liked by our people.
    From the Yin and Shang dynasties, the Han and Jin dynasties, the Sui and Tang dynasties to today, China's musical art has been constantly developing; countless famous or unknown musicians have inherited the precious heritage of their predecessors and passed it down from generation to generation. What should be exciting is that the musicians of our era, under the guidance of the "let a hundred flowers bloom" literary and artistic policy, will make greater contributions and cultivate more successors. At the opening ceremony concert, the young performers next to the gray-haired guqin player, and the little pianist wearing a red scarf, are not they the promising next generation we expect!

    音乐艺术百花齐放的序曲
    ——记全国音乐周开幕式音乐会
    朱树兰
    八月一日晚上，第一届全国音乐周在北京开幕了。
    你看，在主席台上坐着的是来自各个地区的音乐工作者，他们是几十位推动我们的音乐事业发展的代表人物。有的为了发掘和保存民族、民间音乐的优秀遗产在奔波，有的为了广泛、深入地发挥音乐艺术的战斗作用忙碌，有的努力地在学习人民的音乐语言，准备更好地歌唱新社会、新生活。还有那许多歌唱家、演奏家，有的来自民间，有的来自戏曲舞台，有的来自音乐事业团体……，但是，他们的歌声、乐声同样受到人们的喜爱和欢迎，鼓舞了人们的战斗情绪。
    象征着音乐艺术“百花齐放”的开幕式音乐会，包含了多么丰富的内容！歌颂祖国的歌声响起来了，这歌声表现了人民建设社会主义的热情。工人们是美好的幸福生活的开路先锋，农民们看到了“合作社就是通天的大路”；我们的下一代，少年儿童们正在欢快的日子里愉快地游玩。这一切，要是没有共产党的领导和红军的千辛万苦的长征是不会到来的。音乐家没有忘记苦难的日子，没有忘记新音乐运动的先驱者，他们曾经多么勇敢地紧握着自己的武器，为祖国的独立、人民的觉醒发出战斗的号角。冼星海的“黄河大合唱”，在今天仍然是这样震撼着我们的心灵。聂耳的“新女性”、刘天华的“光明行”、黄自的“抗敌歌”“旗正飘飘”……，在当时，这些歌曲、乐曲曾经多么有力地呼唤着妇女摆脱封建的家庭和社会的桎梏，要她们挺起胸来像人一样地活下去；也曾反映了青年和知识分子对于光明的未来的无限向往；更激起了全国人民对于帝国主义侵略者和反动统治者的仇恨，和他们的爱国主义的热情。人民受奴役、被压迫的日子一去不复返了。
    在中国音乐艺术的沃土上，自古以来，无数的辛勤耕耘者，创造了多种多样的优美形式，来反映人民的思想感情和满足他们的不同爱好。聂耳根据民间乐曲“八板”改编的“金蛇狂舞”，是多么明快、热烈，生动活泼地表现了民间欢乐的情景。古乐“普庵咒”却给人带来宁静、平和的气氛。内蒙民歌、哈萨克民歌、青海民歌，虽然产生于不同的民族、相距很远的地区，不是同样深深地感染了听众吗？那些即使是近几十年才流传到我国的合唱形式、钢琴组曲，也逐渐为我们人民所熟习和喜好了。
    远自殷商、汉晋、隋唐到今天，我国的音乐艺术不断地在发展；无数知名或者不知名的音乐家，他们继承了前人的宝贵遗产，一代一代地留传下来。应该兴奋的是，我们这个时代的音乐家，在“百花齐放”文艺方针的指导下，将作出更大的贡献，培养出更多的承继者。在开幕式音乐会上，须发苍苍的古琴家旁边的青年演奏者，和系着红领巾的小钢琴手，不就是我们所期望的、有为的后一辈吗！
