    Northeast Foothills of Changbai Mountain
    Large-Scale Collection of Larch Seeds
    (Our report) In the Antu and Helong counties of Jilin Province, located in the northeast foothills of Changbai Mountain, there are large areas of pure larch forests. According to investigations by the forestry departments of the two counties, this year is an unusually abundant harvest year for tree seeds. Based on statistics from just over 2,050 hectares of forest land in the Hongqi River and Changshanling operational areas of Helong County, more than 25,000 jin of seeds can be collected, more than double the original collection plan for the entire county. The quality of the seeds is also very good, with full and plump kernels.
    Currently, the Helong County Forestry Bureau and the Subsidiary Production Committee have organized 1,600 farmers and more than 100 ox carts to enter the mountains to collect seeds, starting from August 18th. The large-scale collection of larch seeds not only prepares certain material conditions for future afforestation work but also allows farmers to greatly increase their income from subsidiary production. It is estimated that the farmers participating in seed collection in Helong County will earn more than 200,000 yuan. Wang Tingfu

    长白山东北麓地区
    大量采集落叶松种籽
    本报讯　在长白山东北麓的吉林省的安图、和龙两县境内，生长着大面积的落叶松纯林。据两县林业部门调查，今年是几年来所没有的树种丰收年。仅据在和龙县红旗河、长山岭两个施业区内调查的二千零五十多公顷林地的统计，就可采集种子二万五千多斤，比原定全县采集计划多两倍多。树种的质量也非常良好，种仁充实饱满。
    目前，和龙县林业局和副业生产委员会已经组织了一千六百名农民和一百多台牛车，从八月十八日开始，入山采集树种。大量采集落叶松树种，不但为未来的造林工作准备了一定的物资条件，而且可以使农民大量增加副业收入。估计和龙县参加采种的农民将获得二十万元以上的收入。　王庭富
