Xinhua News Agency, Lianyungang, 3rd: Four Japanese fishing boats, including the Chōgyo Maru and Ebisu Maru, sailed into Lianyungang on the 2nd to take shelter from the typhoon.

    That morning at 9:00 AM, as the Japanese fishing boats entered Lianyungang, a speedboat carrying personnel from the Lianyungang Border Inspection Station approached them to handle the entry procedures. After completing the procedures, Cheng Jianhe, a lieutenant inspector from the Border Inspection Station, welcomed the Japanese ship captain, Ike Waki ​​Sakuji, and offered to protect them. Japanese Captain Ike Waki ​​Sakuji shook the inspector's hand and said gratefully, "Thank you."

    At 5:00 PM, Xu Hejun, the deputy director of the Xinhai Lianyungang Fisheries Association, boarded the ship to visit the Japanese captain and offered to help them solve their difficulties. The Japanese captain requested assistance in purchasing some ice and heavy diesel. Xu Hejun said he would contact the relevant parties to help them make the purchases. Japanese Communications Sergeant Motojima Shimei said, "When I was in my country, I heard that the Chinese people are very friendly to international friends, and now I have personally experienced this." Captain Ike Waki ​​Sakuji also took out a piece of paper and asked Xu Hejun to sign it as a souvenir.

    The Japanese fishing boats sailed into Lianyungang in accordance with the 1955 agreement between the Chinese Fisheries Association and the Japan-China Fisheries Council regarding fisheries in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.

    日本渔轮到连云港避台风
    新华社连云港3日电　日本的长渔丸、蛭子丸等四艘渔轮二日驶进连云港躲避台风。
    这天上午九时，当日本渔轮驶进连云港时，一艘载着连云港边防检查站人员的汽艇迎上前去，为日本渔轮办理入港手续。办完手续以后，边防检查站的中尉检查员成健鹤向日本船长池肋作二表示欢迎，并表示负责保护他们。日本船长池肋作二握着检查员的手感激地说：“谢谢你们。”
    下午五时，新海连市渔业协会副主任徐河均登轮访问了日本船长，并表示可以帮助他们解决困难。日本船长请求帮助他们购买一些冰及重柴油，徐河均表示向有关方面接洽后帮助他们购买。日本通讯上士本岛泗明说：“我在国内的时候，听说中国人对国际友人非常友好，现在亲身体会到了这一点。”船长池肋作二还拿出一张纸请徐河均签名留念。
    日本渔轮是根据1955年中国渔业协会和日本日中渔业协议会关于黄海、东海渔业的协定驶进连云港的。
