Private Personnel Need More Support and Trust
Chen Suiheng, Vice Chairman of Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce

After the public-private partnership of industry and commerce, private personnel often ask each other: "How is the public representative in your factory?" "Are your public-private relations good?" Whether the public and private sectors work well together is indeed an important issue in public-private joint ventures.

It should be said that the vast majority of private personnel are willing to work hard, be dutiful and make achievements after the enterprise becomes a joint venture; most of the public representatives can also unite and educate the private sector and give them the trust and support they deserve in accordance with the state's policy of peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. These are all good phenomena. However, some public representatives do not give enough trust and support to private personnel, and the employees do not respect the authority of private personnel, so their production improvement, technological improvement and the exertion of their enthusiasm in the enterprise are affected to a certain extent.

The public and private sectors are cooperating for the first time, so they lack practical experience, especially the private personnel have poor policy understanding, and they do have a lot of concerns in their hearts. A private deputy director of an old joint venture enterprise talked about his feelings when he first got along with the public representative: "It is not easy to get along with a stranger. Especially when the object of getting along is not only an ordinary colleague and friend relationship, but also a relationship between leader and the led. I really don't know how to get along!" This kind of feeling is understandable. Some public representatives in enterprises are more polite to private personnel, but lack help. They are polite when they meet, just chatting, but do not assign specific work to private personnel. It makes the private personnel feel that "we are here to make a show." Many private personnel reflect that some meetings that should be attended cannot be attended, documents, reports, and plans that should be seen cannot be seen, and some public representatives do not explain the methods when assigning tasks, or do not consult with private personnel in advance when deploying work, which makes people feel at a loss. There are also individual public representatives who have a rigid style and label people at every turn, which makes the private personnel nervous and worried. These phenomena must be paid attention to and resolved.

The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce recently held a symposium for private representatives. The most urgent requirement of everyone is to give private personnel the trust and support they deserve. Some people said: "It is easy to do things with the trust and support of the public sector." "The specific help from the public sector can enable us to transform ourselves in all aspects." The public-private relations of Wuxi Zhenxin Yarn Factory, Changzhou Dacheng Yarn Factory, and Suzhou Guangming Silk Factory are better because the public sector trusts and supports the private sector, and the private sector is active and positive in their work. I participated in this symposium and deeply experienced that if the public representative can give private personnel trust and support, they can help them overcome their sense of inferiority, give play to their active role and establish a sense of ownership. For example, the public director of Changzhou Yifengchang Dyeing Factory approved the purchase of a clock for a certain department. Later, the private director found out that another department had an extra clock, so he changed the original decision; some people felt that the private director overstepped his authority, but the public director gave the necessary support. He pointed out that the private director did the right thing, saving unnecessary expenses for the enterprise, and showing the attitude of the master, which greatly encouraged the private sector.

Private personnel lack experience in the operation and management of socialist enterprises, so they urgently require public representatives to explain working methods in specific work and help them improve their professional level. Many public representatives can patiently help private personnel learn to make reports, master meetings, analyze problems, and go to workshops and departments with private personnel to study work. This approach is of great help to them, making private personnel feel that they have authority, responsibility, and democracy. Private personnel also hope to hold regular symposiums between the public and private sectors within the enterprise to further communicate ideas and improve relations. Private personnel generally feel that their theoretical level is poor, and they urgently need to study political theory, and hope that public representatives will give active help and support.

Improving the relationship between public and private cooperation is a two-way issue. As private personnel, we should first adopt an active attitude, study modestly, work hard, and be dutiful. Many private personnel have made achievements in this regard and have been commended. However, there are still some private personnel who are not active in their work, are afraid of taking responsibility, are emotionally negative, rely on the public sector one-sidedly and simply, and mistakenly believe that "the more you do, the more mistakes you make, the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and you won't make mistakes if you don't do anything." Some people observe the words and expressions of others in their work, worry and suspect, cannot be open and honest, do not speak in person, and murmur behind their backs. Not being proactive in work is the biggest obstacle for us to accept transformation and move forward, and we must strive to correct these shortcomings. It should be recognized that there are still capitalist ways of thinking and habits in our thinking and work, which will bring negative factors that are unfavorable to socialism to the enterprise, and will increase the difficulty of improving the cooperative relationship.

Among the private personnel, many have production technology knowledge and business management capabilities, but we must never be arrogant and complacent; what we have learned and what we understand is not enough, and some are still very superficial. Although there are achievements in our work, there are still many shortcomings. We must not only see the bright side, but also see the dark side. Correct opinions should be adhered to, and wrong opinions should be corrected. We must humbly learn from public representatives, humbly learn from the masses of workers, learn socialist operation and management skills, learn the labor enthusiasm of the working masses, and shorten the distance with the working masses in work and labor, so as to transform into a self-reliant worker as soon as possible.

### 私方人员需要更多的支持和信任

    私方人员需要更多的支持和信任
    江苏省工商业联合会副主任委员　陈邃衡
    工商业公私合营以后，在私方人员之间，常常这样的互相问道：“你们厂的公股代表怎样？”“你们的公私关系搞的好不好？”公私双方共事共得好或坏，确是公私合营企业中的一个重要问题。
    应该说，绝大多数私方人员在企业合营后，都愿意努力工作，守职尽责，作出成绩；多数的公方代表，也都能根据国家对资本主义工商业和平改造的方针政策，团结教育私方，给予他们应有的信任和支持。这都是很好的现象。但是，某些公方代表对私方人员却信任支持不够，职工又不够尊重私方人员职权，因此他们在企业的生产改进、技术提高和发挥积极性上受到一定的影响。
    公私双方都是初次合作共事，因此缺乏实际经验，尤其是私方人员的政策水平差，心里确有不少顾虑。一位老合营企业的私方副厂长谈到他初次和公方代表相处时的心情说：“同一个陌生人相处，很不简单。特别是相处的对象不单是普通同事和朋友关系，而又是领导与被领导的关系。真不知如何相处才好！”这种心情是可以理解的。有些企业的公方代表对私方人员的态度是客气有余，帮助则不足。见面客客气气，打哈哈，就是不分配私方人员具体工作。使私方人员感觉到“我们是来摆摆样子的”。不少私方人员反映，有些会议应该参加的不能参加，应该看到的文件、报表、计划不能看到，有些公方代表布置任务不交代方法，或是在布置工作时，事先不和私方人员商量，使人感觉到无所适从。也有个别的公方代表，作风生硬，动不动就扣帽子，弄得私方人员的思想紧张，患得患失。这些现象是必须予以注意和加以解决的。
    江苏省工商业联合会最近召开了私方代表座谈会，大家最迫切的要求就是给予私方人员应有的信任和支持。有人说：“得到公方的信任和支持就好办事。”“公方的具体帮助，可以使我们从各方面来改造自己。”无锡市振新纱厂、常州市大成纱厂、苏州市光明丝厂等公私关系搞的较好，就是因为公方对私方信任支持，私方工作主动积极。我参加了这次座谈会，深切地体验到如果公方代表能对私方人员给予信任支持，就可以帮助他们克服自卑感，发挥积极作用和树立主人翁思想。例如常州市益丰昌染厂公方厂长批准了某科室购买一个钟，后来私方厂长调查出另一科室多余一个钟，就改变了原有的决定；有些人员觉得私方厂长越权，但是公方厂长给予了必要的支持，他指出私方厂长这样做是对的，为企业节省了不必要的开支，是主人翁的态度，使私方受到很大鼓舞。
    私方人员缺乏对社会主义企业经营管理的经验，因此他们迫切要求公方代表在具体工作中，能够交代工作方法，帮助他们提高业务水平。不少公方代表都能够耐心地帮助私方人员学习做报告，掌握会议，分析问题，和私方人员一道下车间、下科室去研究工作。这种做法对他们的帮助很大，使私方人员感到有职有权，有责、有民主。私方人员还希望在企业内部定期召开公私双方的座谈会，来进一步沟通思想情况，搞好关系。私方人员普遍感到理论水平差，迫切地要求学习政治理论，希望公方代表给予积极的帮助和支持。
    改进公私合作共事关系，是双方面的问题。作为私方人员来说，首先应该抱着主动积极的态度，虚心学习，努力工作，守职尽责。许多私方人员在这方面已作出成绩，得到表扬。不过，也还有一些私方人员工作不主动，怕负责任，情绪消极，片面的、单纯的依赖公方，错误地认为“多做多错，少做少错，不做不错。”有的人在工作中察言观色，顾虑猜疑，不能开诚布公，当面不说，背后叽咕。工作不主动积极是我们接受改造前进中的最大障碍，我们要努力改正这些缺点。应该认识到，在我们思想和工作方面还存在着资本主义的思想方法和习惯，这些都会给企业带来不利于社会主义的消极因素，都会给搞好合作共事关系增加困难。
    私方人员中间，不少人是有生产技术知识和经营管理的能力的，但是我们绝不能骄傲自满；我们所学的所懂得的还不够多，有些还很浮浅，工作虽有成绩，但还存在不少缺点，我们既要看到成绩的一面，也应看阴暗的一面。对正确的意见要坚持，对错误的意见要修正。我们必须虚心向公方代表学习，虚心向职工群众学习，学习社会主义经营管理的技能，学习工人群众的劳动热情，在工作中、劳动中来缩短和工人群众的距离，以便早日改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者。
