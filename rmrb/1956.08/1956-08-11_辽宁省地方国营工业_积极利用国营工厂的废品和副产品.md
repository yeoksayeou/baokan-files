    Local State-Owned Industries in Liaoning Province
    Actively Utilize Waste Products and By-Products from State-Owned Factories
    (By Our Correspondent) News from this paper: Some local state-owned factories in Liaoning Province have used waste products and by-products from state-owned factories to manufacture many important products.
    The local state-owned Fushun Oil Refinery, for example, has relied on the waste materials from Fushun No. 1 and No. 2 Petroleum Factories for production for several years. In the past three and a half years, they have recovered a large amount of waste oil from the wastewater ditches of Fushun No. 1 and No. 2 Petroleum Factories, and after distillation and processing, manufactured more than 24,000 tons of light and heavy diesel oil. They also used waste oil to manufacture chemical raw materials such as green oil, fish scales, and paraffin wax. The "nitrocellulose" produced by the local state-owned Liaoning Cotton Mill was also successfully trial-produced using waste cotton such as broken seed cotton, gin motes, floor sweepings, and oily cotton from state-owned and local state-owned textile mills as raw materials, with the assistance of scientific and technological departments. The product quality is very good, and the cost is also very low. This factory has decided to expand the scope of waste cotton processing this year, from the original ten textile factories in Northeast China to thirty-three textile factories in Qingdao, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, etc. The estimated output will increase seven times compared to 1953. In the past year, the local state-owned Shenyang Shoe Factory used waste conveyor belts from mines to make soles for more than 43,000 pairs of "farmer shoes" and "labor protection shoes," saving more than 49,000 jin of cow leather; and made more than 27,000 pairs of shoe uppers, saving more than 27,000 square feet of canvas. The shoes made are durable, wear-resistant, and inexpensive, and are very popular among consumers.
    The Fushun Municipal Industrial Bureau, which has done a good job in utilizing waste materials in the past, now plans to further utilize the coal slag from state-owned power plants to produce coal slag bricks, with an annual output of 80,000 bricks; use the sawdust from state-owned timber factories (about 2,600 tons per year) to produce white wine (trial production has been successful); and use the rice husks and rice bran from grain and rice processing factories to produce oil and wine (trial production has been successful). In addition, a large amount of phosphate fertilizer will be produced using waste sulfuric acid from petroleum factories, soap will be produced using alkali residue, refractory materials will be produced using lead sulfate residue, and alloy steel will be produced using waste steel. These are all planned to be realized in the next few years.

    辽宁省地方国营工业
    积极利用国营工厂的废品和副产品
    本报讯　辽宁省有些地方国营工厂利用国营工厂的废品和副产品制造了许多重要的产品。
    地方国营抚顺市制油厂，几年来就是靠利用抚顺石油一厂和二厂的废料来进行生产的。在过去的三年半中，他们从抚顺石油一厂和二厂的废水沟中回收了大量废油，经过蒸溜加工制造出轻、重柴油等二万四千多吨。他们还利用废杂油制造了青油、鱼鳞片、石腊等化工原料。地方国营辽宁市制棉厂生产的“硝化棉”，也是利用国营和地方国营纺织厂的破籽棉、车肚棉、地洞棉、油棉等废棉作为原料，在科学技术部门的帮助下试制成功的。产品质量很好，成本也很低。这个厂今年决定扩大处理废棉范围，由原来东北十个纺织厂扩大到青岛、天津、郑州等三十三个纺织厂，估计产量将较1953年增长七倍。一年来，地方国营沈阳市制鞋厂利用矿山的废运输带做了四万三千多双“农民鞋”和“劳动保护鞋”的鞋底，节省牛皮革四万九千多斤；做了二万七千多双鞋面，节省帆布二万七千多平方尺。做的鞋结实耐穿，价格便宜，很受消费者的欢迎。
    过去利用废料作得较好的抚顺市工业局，现在计划进一步利用国营发电厂的煤渣生产煤渣砖，年产量可达八万块；利用国营木材厂的锯末（每年约有二千六百多吨）来生产白酒（已经试制成功）；利用粮米加工厂的稻皮、稻糠制油和制酒（已经试制成功）。此外还将利用石油厂的废硫酸生产大量磷肥，利用碱渣生产肥皂，利用硫酸铅渣生产耐火材料，利用废钢材生产合金钢等。这些都准备在最近几年内实现。
