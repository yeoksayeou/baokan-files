Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 10th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wu Jianmin) reports: The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee and several special districts have discovered in recent investigations that formalism exists in the work of many county and township People's Congresses in Heilongjiang Province, failing to play their due role. When the Hulan County People's Congress holds meetings, the form is always grand, but the content is very poor. Besides lengthy work reports, there are very few speeches by representatives. The county People's Congress has 327 representatives, but only six representatives spoke at the second meeting, four at the third meeting, and fourteen at the fourth meeting. Most of the speeches were polite remarks, without criticism or suggestions.

Many counties and townships also failed to convene meetings of the People's Congress within the time stipulated by the "Organizational Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees of the People's Republic of China." According to investigations in sixteen cities and counties, only one city convened meetings in full accordance with the prescribed time, while the rest did not. Furthermore, according to a survey of thirty-four townships in one county, thirty-two townships did not hold meetings of the People's Congress every three months as required.

Some county and township People's Congresses in Heilongjiang Province generally only focus on or are satisfied with the democratic form of holding meetings, paying insufficient attention to the substance of democracy. At the seventh meeting of the Qing'an County People's Congress this year, the county's leading cadres made a report of about twenty-five pages, which did not mention any shortcomings in the county's leadership work. None of the ten representatives who spoke at the meeting raised any criticisms of the work of the County People's Committee. The development of democracy at township People's Congress meetings is even more inadequate. Changling Township in Hulan County once held a six-hour People's Congress meeting, where five cadres made five reports respectively, and resolutions were passed without discussion. Proposals put forward by representatives are generally not handled seriously.

Because county and township People's Congresses have not played their due role, representatives are also not very active in attending meetings. 132 representatives were absent from the fifth meeting of the Hulan County People's Congress, accounting for 40.3% of the total number of representatives. One hundred were absent from the sixth meeting, and another forty-five were temporarily absent on the first day of the meeting. Some of these temporarily absent representatives went to visit relatives, and some wandered around in the streets. Some incumbent cadres elected as People's Representatives also often do not attend meetings, and sometimes there are more absences. In addition, many People's Representatives lack contact with voters and the People's Committee in normal times. Only a few days before the People's Congress meeting, they go to the voters to collect proposals, and after the meeting, they do not implement the resolutions of the meeting.

The reason for the above situation, according to the investigation team formed by relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province, is that some cadres mistakenly believe that this system is only to "go through the motions and engage in united front work" and that "this kind of meeting is not as effective as administrative cadre meetings." In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and better give play to the role of the People's Congress as an organ of power, relevant leading organs in Heilongjiang Province believe that these erroneous ideas must be thoroughly corrected.

### 黑龙江组织调查组研究纠正形式主义的毛病  充分发挥县乡人民代表大会的作用

    黑龙江组织调查组研究纠正形式主义的毛病
    充分发挥县乡人民代表大会的作用
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　新华社记者吴建民报道：黑龙江省人民委员会和几个专署在最近调查中发现，黑龙江省许多县、乡人民代表大会的工作存在形式主义的毛病，没有能发挥它应有的作用。呼兰县人民代表大会每次举行会议时，形式上都是隆重的，但是会议内容却很贫乏，除了冗长的工作报告外，代表发言极少。这个县人民代表大会共有327名代表，可是在第二次会议上发言的只有六名代表，在第三次会议上发言的只有四人，在第四次会议上发言的也只有十四人。发言的大多是讲些客套话，没有批评和建议。
    许多县、乡也没有按照中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法所规定的时间内召开人民代表大会会议。据在十六个市、县的调查，完全按照规定时间召开会议的只有一个市，其余的都没有按照规定时间召开会议。又据一个县的三十四个乡镇的调查，就有三十二个乡镇没有按照规定每三个月举行一次人民代表大会会议。
    黑龙江省有些县、乡人民代表大会一般只偏重或满足于开会的民主形式，对民主的实质注意不够。庆安县今年召开的人民代表大会第七次会议上，县的负责干部在会上作了长约二十五页的报告，报告中没有提到县的领导工作有什么缺点，在会议上发言的十名代表，没有一个人对县人民委员会的工作提出批评。乡级人民代表大会会议发扬民主更为不够。呼兰县的长岭乡曾经开过一次六小时的人民代表大会会议，由五个干部分别作了五个报告，没有讨论就通过了决议。代表提出的提案一般都不认真处理。
    由于县、乡人民代表大会没有起到它应有的作用，代表们出席会议也很不积极。呼兰县人民代表大会第五次会议缺席代表132名，占代表总数40.3％，第六次会议缺一百名，在会议第一天又临时缺席四十五名。这些临时缺席的代表有的去看亲戚，有的在街上溜达。有些当选为人民代表的在职干部也常不去参加会议，有时缺席较多。另外，有不少人民代表平时同选民及人民委员会之间缺少联系，只有在召开人民代表大会会议的前几天，才到选民中收集提案，开完会后，也不贯彻会议决议。
    所以形成以上情况，据黑龙江省有关部门组成的调查组了解，是有些干部错误地认为这种制度只是为了“走走形式，搞搞统一战线”、“这种会议没有行政干部会议起作用”。为了把广大群众积极性调动起来，更好地发挥人民代表大会这一权力机关的作用，黑龙江省有关领导机关认为必须彻底纠正这些错误思想。
