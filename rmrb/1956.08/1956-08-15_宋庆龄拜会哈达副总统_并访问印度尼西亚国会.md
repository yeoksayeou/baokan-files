    宋庆龄拜会哈达副总统
    并访问印度尼西亚国会
    新华社雅加达14日电　中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄今天上午十时前往印度尼西亚副总统官邸拜会了哈达副总统。
    后来她又访问了印度尼西亚国会。在那里，她受到了第一副议长阿里芬和第三副议长艾哈迈德的接待。
    陪同宋庆龄前往的有印度尼西亚外交部礼宾司司长乌多约、印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆参赞萨尼以及中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和夫人。
    印度尼西亚首都人民今天热烈地欢迎他们期待已久的中国朋友。他们许多年以来就知道她。市内主要大街上建立起来了两座高大的彩色牌楼，上面写着：“欢迎可敬的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长”。宋庆龄所到之处，在路旁，在商店的窗口，在过路的汽车上，都有许多人纷纷向她招手或挥动手帕。她无论到哪里，人们都从各方面拥上前来，拥挤在她的汽车周围，鼓掌欢呼中国和印度尼西亚友好。在她到达国会以前，就已经有成千的人站在国会前面。当她出现在门口的时候，人们向她热烈地鼓掌表示欢迎。
