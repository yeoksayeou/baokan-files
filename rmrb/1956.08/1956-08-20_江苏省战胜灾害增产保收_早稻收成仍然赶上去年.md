Jiangsu Province Overcomes Disasters to Increase Production and Ensure Harvests
Early Rice Harvest Still Catches Up with Last Year

(Our Newspaper News) Jiangsu Province, one of the major grain-producing areas in the country, has achieved a bumper harvest in the 800,000 mu of double-season early rice that were widely promoted for the first time this year. The 5 million mu of single-season early rice are also being harvested intensely after overcoming the typhoon disaster, and are generally expected to catch up with last year's level.

This year, Jiangsu Province promoted adaptive replanting measures according to local conditions. Double-season rice was promoted in the Taihu Lake basin south of the Yangtze River, and measures to increase production such as converting early indica rice to early and late japonica rice were vigorously promoted in Zhenjiang and the Lixiahe area. Thanks to the timely and strengthened specific guidance on replanting by Party committees and relevant departments, despite the onslaught of floods and typhoons, agricultural cooperatives in various places, with a tenacious fighting spirit, actively overcame natural disasters and strived to increase production and ensure harvests. At present, the double-season early rice has been harvested. The single-yield per mu of double-season early rice in the Taihu Lake basin is about 450 jin, an increase of about 10% compared with previous years. The Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative, where Chen Yongkang, the national model of rice production, is located, has converted more than 1,900 mu to double-season early rice this year, of which 1,400 mu have a single yield of 550 jin, which has reached the average yield of late rice in the local area in previous years. In Huancheng District, Kunshan County, the more than 17,000 mu of double-season early rice generally yielded more than 500 jin, and some yielded more than 600 jin. In the Wubao Cooperative in the Sixth District of Wuxi County, a 1.67 mu field of double-season early rice actually produced 1,730 jin of rice (after one day of sunning), with an average single yield of 1,035 jin per mu, which is nearly double the yield of single-season late rice in previous years. Song Lianfang, the secretary of the Zhenze County Party Committee, told reporters: "In the past, our county's grain-producing area mainly planted late rice. This year, we have vigorously promoted crop rotation of rice and wheat and double-season rice. Now the county has had a bumper wheat harvest, with an average of 240 jin per mu, and double-season early rice has also had a bumper harvest, with an average of more than 500 jin per mu. Therefore, we have full confidence in strengthening autumn field management and striving to make the county a 'thousand-jin county'."

Following the bumper harvest of double-season early rice, the province was hit by a typhoon at the beginning of this month. Agricultural cooperatives in various places promptly drained accumulated water before and after the typhoon, and adopted methods such as cutting down the lodged crops first and then the upright ones, and harvesting and threshing as they went, which greatly reduced losses. At present, the overall harvest has begun, and all crops will be brought to the threshing ground by the end of this month. The average single-yield of early rice in Jianhu, Yancheng, and other four counties is 299 jin, an increase of 10% compared with last year. The early Shajing and other rice varieties promoted this year showed superior wind resistance in the typhoon, with little lodging and shattering. In Nanhui County, more than 280,000 mu of Shajing rice is expected to yield an average of 520 jin per mu.

    江苏省战胜灾害增产保收
    早稻收成仍然赶上去年
    本报讯　全国粮食主要产区之一的江苏省，今年第一次大面积推广的八十万亩双季早稻普遍获得丰收，五百万亩单季早稻战胜台灾后也正在紧张抢收，一般可赶上去年水平。
    江苏省今年因地制宜地推广改种措施，在长江以南的太湖流域地区推广了双季稻，在镇江和里下河地区大力推广了早籼改早晚粳等增产措施，由于党委和有关部门及时加强了改种具体指导，虽有涝灾和台灾的侵袭，各地农业社以顽强的战斗精神，积极战胜自然灾害，争取增产保收。目前，双季早稻已收割完毕，太湖流域双季早稻每亩单产在四百五十斤左右，比往年约增产一成以上。全国水稻丰产模范陈永康所在的联民农业社，今年改种的一千九百多亩双季早稻，有一千四百亩单产在五百五十斤，已达到往年当地晚稻的平均产量。昆山县环城区全区一万七千多亩双季早稻，一般收五百多斤，好的超过六百斤。无锡县六区乡五保社一块一亩六分七厘的双季早稻田，实产稻谷1，730斤（已晒一个太阳）平均每亩单产1，035斤，超过往年单季晚稻产量近一倍。震泽县县委书记宋莲芳对记者说：“过去我县粮产区主要是种晚稻的，今年大面积推广稻麦连作和双季稻，现在全县小麦丰收，平均每亩达二百四十斤，双季早稻又获丰收，平均每亩收五百斤以上，因此，我们有充分信心，加强秋季田间管理，争取全县成为千斤县。”
    继双季早稻丰收后，全省于本月初遭到台风侵袭，各地农业社在台风过境前后及时排除积水，采用先割倒伏的，后割直立的，随收随打等办法，大大减轻了损失。目前，已开始全面收割，到本月下旬可全部登场。建湖、盐城等四县早稻平均单产299斤，比去年增产一成，今年推广的早沙等稻种，在台风中表现了优越的抗风能力，脱粒倒伏现象很少，南汇县二十八万多亩沙粳稻，平均每亩可收五百二十斤。
