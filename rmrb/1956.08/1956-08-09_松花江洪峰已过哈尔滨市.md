Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 8th: Yesterday, the flood peak of the Songhua River passed Harbin. The highest water level of the river surface in Harbin yesterday reached 119.64 meters; by 10:00 AM today, the water level had dropped to 119.54 meters.

The flood peak did not reach the expected 119.80 meters, mainly because three breaches occurred in the dikes upstream of Harbin.

When the flood peak arrived, Harbin was hit by strong winds and rain, and the river surface was turbulent. Several collapses and seepages occurred in the dikes surrounding the city for more than ten kilometers. After more than 70,000 flood-fighting troops in the city braved the rain to rescue the situation, no accidents occurred in the urban area. Only some farmland in Songpu District in the suburbs was flooded, and all 3,000 residents of Songpu District have been evacuated.

    松花江洪峰已过哈尔滨市
    据新华社哈尔滨8日电　昨天，松花江的洪峰已经过了哈尔滨市。哈尔滨市昨天的江面最高水位曾达119.64公尺；到今天上午十点，水位已下降到119.54公尺。
    这次洪峰没有达到预计的119.80公尺，主要原因是哈尔滨上游堤防发生了三处决口。
    洪峰来到时，哈尔滨恰好遇到大风雨袭击，江面波浪汹涌，环绕市区十多公里堤坝发生了好几处沉陷和浸透现象。经全市七万多防汛大军冒雨抢救，市区没有发生意外，只有郊区松浦区淹了部分农田，松浦区三千多名居民已全部迁出。
