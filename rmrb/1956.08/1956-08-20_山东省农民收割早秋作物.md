Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th - In recent days, farmers in the southern Shandong provinces of Linyi, Jining, Heze and the central Shandong provinces of Tai'an and Changwei have successively begun harvesting early autumn crops such as corn and sorghum. Early autumn crops in the downstream Yellow River areas of Liaocheng and Huimin and the Shandong Peninsula will also mature and be harvested in about ten days.

Due to the large amount of fertilizer applied and better field management work than in previous years, such as cultivation, weeding, watering, and pest control, coupled with abundant rainfall, the province's more than 40 million mu of early autumn crops have developed normally during their growing period. According to reports from various regions, the planned targets for increased early autumn crop production can generally be completed or exceeded. According to preliminary estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the unit area yield of early autumn crops throughout the province can increase by at least 10% compared to last year.

    山东省农民收割早秋作物
    新华社济南15日电　近几天来，山东省南部临沂、济宁、菏泽和中部泰安、昌潍等专区，已先后开始收割玉米、高粱等早秋作物。黄河下游聊城、惠民等专区和山东半岛地区的早秋作物，再过十天左右也将成熟收割。
    由于施肥量多，中耕锄草、浇水、除虫等田间管理工作都比往年做得好，再加雨量充沛，全省四千多万亩早秋作物在生长期得到了正常发育。根据各地反映，早秋作物增产计划指标一般都能完成或超过。据省农业厅初步估计，全省早秋作物单位面积产量至少可以比去年增产一成多。
