    Cross-Examination
    By Our Correspondent Shang Kai
    More than forty township Party branch secretaries and township heads crowded the meeting room of the PingShun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all vying to report the results of this cross-examination between townships.
    "Let me talk about the inspection of LiJiaHe Township." Zhang DeShun, the branch secretary of HuiYuanTou Township, took out his diary and was the first to speak, and the meeting room immediately quieted down. "LiJiaHe has many things worth learning from us: First, they conscientiously implemented the four production increase measures put forward by the county party committee. Intercropping and interplanting were carried out in all autumn fields, and oil crops were planted on all sides of the field; Second, many Canadian poplar trees were planted inside and outside the village, with a survival rate of more than 90%; Third, livestock breeding and management are very good. The livestock pens are cleaned very cleanly, the grass is chopped short, the feed is mixed evenly, and the livestock are fed well. ... But," Zhang DeShun looked up at everyone, flipped through his diary again, and continued, "We also found many problems in LiJiaHe." After just saying a sentence, he stopped again. At this time, someone whispered, "Listen, he's embarrassed to mention the problems." Indeed, it is not so easy for township cadres to point out the shortcomings in other people's work face-to-face at such a conference. However, Zhang DeShun wiped his forehead with a towel and finally went on: "According to our inspection, the pigs are fed very badly, and more than forty pigs are getting thinner and thinner; the orchard is also not well managed, and more than forty walnut trees have not been grafted when they should have been; many terraces have been built in the whole township, but there are also many mountain wastelands, enough for more than sixty mu, which destroys water and soil conservation; the lack of seedlings in the valley fields is very serious, with almost two thousand seedlings missing per mu. Some autumn fields have a lot of weeds and are about to become barren. The cadres of the commune said that there were not enough people, but we saw that the women were still idle at home and had not been mobilized." Zhang DeShun seemed to be getting bolder and bolder, and then he mentioned: "We also found the most serious problem, that the agricultural cooperative has not announced its accounts to the members for more than half a year. The members do not know how much they have invested and how many workdays they have done, and they worry that it will be a mess in the future and that the grain will not be distributed." Finally, he added: "Our inspection is very rough, please criticize if there is anything wrong."
    After Zhang DeShun finished his report, Comrade Yang ShuPei, deputy secretary of the county party committee who was chairing the meeting, asked:
  "Does LiJiaHe Township have any different opinions? Or is there anything to add?" Everyone's eyes also shifted to Li FaWang, the branch secretary of LiJiaHe Township. Li FaWang replied, "The problems found by HuiYuanTou Township are all facts." But after hesitating for a while, he said, "I'm afraid there aren't so many missing seedlings in the valley fields. I think there are at most two or three hundred missing per mu." Zhang DeShun disagreed with Li FaWang's opinion. He said, "Many valley fields in LiJiaHe Township are dense on the edges and sparse in the middle. We measured them step by step during the inspection - to say that there are at most two or three hundred missing is not a fact." At this time, many people asked Li FaWang, "It's not enough to just look at it, have you measured it carefully?" This question made Li FaWang unable to answer, his face turned red, and he had to say, "I will do another inspection when I go back."
    Someone else raised a question: "Why is LiJiaHe Township reclaiming wasteland? Don't they know that reclaiming wasteland is destroying water and soil conservation?" Zhang DeShun added some information they had learned: "This spring, LiJiaHe Township set a very large plan for building terraces. When the masses were worried about not being able to complete it, the township cadres said to everyone, "You have to find ways to find shortcuts." Since then, the masses began to reclaim wasteland." On this issue, a discussion was launched at the meeting. One said, "The cadres of LiJiaHe Township consciously instructed the masses to reclaim wasteland." Another said, "The cadres of LiJiaHe Township saw the masses reclaiming wasteland and did nothing about it, acting as the tail of the masses." Li FaWang, the branch secretary of LiJiaHe Township, did not admit that the cadres consciously instructed the masses to reclaim wasteland, because they had indeed not said the words "you can reclaim wasteland." But why was the wasteland reclaimed? Wu ShuiQing, the branch secretary of ShangWuJing Township, analyzed it very well. He said, "The masses saw that the plan for building terraces was very large, and they originally had the idea of using wasteland reclamation to complete the plan. At this time, the township cadres did not educate and help the masses, but only told them to "find shortcuts." This is actually encouraging the masses to reclaim wasteland. If the cadres of LiJiaHe Township have a very clear understanding that wasteland cannot be reclaimed, then why don't they care when the masses reclaim wasteland?"
    Finally, based on everyone's opinions, the county party committee made an inspection conclusion on LiJiaHe Township, instructing Li FaWang, the branch secretary of LiJiaHe Township, to convey and discuss it in the branch, study and solve the existing problems one by one, and report the results to the county party committee.
    Next to speak was Guo JuFa, the branch secretary of YangWei Township, who reported on the inspection of ZhaoCheng Township. The most outstanding achievement of ZhaoCheng Township's work was that they paid attention to solving the difficulties in the lives of the masses. However, in agricultural production, there is a phenomenon of neglecting small plots of land, which is a big problem in mountainous areas. Guo ShuangDe, the branch secretary of ShenJiaPing, reported on the inspection of LongZhen Township. The main achievements in production there are the accumulation of fertilizer and early sowing. All small plots of land and sides of fields have been planted, but the lack of seedlings and broken ridges in the autumn fields are very serious. ... The meeting lasted for three days, and every township made a report, reflecting various aspects of the situation and problems. After listening to these reports, even if you are a newcomer to PingShun County, where the work is advanced, where the work is backward, where significant achievements have been made, and where there are serious shortcomings, you will be able to see it at a glance.
    Although the cross-examination reporting meeting lasted a long time and the meeting room was small, the participants' mood was always full and the atmosphere at the meeting was always active. Because through concrete research and analysis, everyone's minds were clear, they clarified which advantages in their work should be carried forward and which shortcomings should be corrected, and they found the main problems in the current work and solutions.
    Because I didn't get a chance to participate in the cross-examination between townships, I didn't know their specific practices very well, so I took advantage of the break in the meeting to visit several township branch secretaries, and they introduced me to the specific process of cross-examination. In summary, the cross-examination generally goes through the following steps: First, the township branch and the township people's committee organize cross-examinations between agricultural cooperatives in the township and make inspection summaries of each agricultural cooperative. Second, the township selects representatives democratically to organize inspection teams to conduct inspections in nearby townships. Third, after the inspection team arrives at the inspected township, it first listens to the party branch introducing the township's situation, then goes deep into the fields for on-the-spot observation, and conducts interviews and visits with farmers to learn from experience and discover problems. After the inspection is completed, it reports the inspection results to the local branch and jointly studies improvement measures. Fourth, which is the step that is currently being carried out, the inspectors and the inspected report to the county together, carry out criticism and self-criticism, affirm achievements, point out shortcomings, and finally the county party committee makes an inspection summary and the township branch implements it.
    After listening to the general meeting report and the introduction of several township branch secretaries, I feel that this cross-examination method is really good, but how was the cross-examination proposed? Comrade Yang ShuPei, deputy secretary of the county party committee, told me: "Cross-examination is not our new creation. In the past, the county party committee checked work, generally dispatching county-level cadres to organize inspection teams to go to the countryside for inspection. Due to the high mountains and long roads, the number of inspectors was limited, and some cadres from student backgrounds were not very familiar with agricultural production, so the inspection was neither universal nor in-depth, and neither discovered problems nor solved them. We felt very distressed. Last year, at the provincial rural work conference, Comrade Tao LuJia, the provincial party secretary, introduced the Soviet Union's cross-examination work method, which inspired us a lot. Since then, although we have organized two or three cross-examinations, none of them have been as successful as this one." What role has cross-examination played? The PingShun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made the following summary in a report to the provincial party committee: "Cross-examination can summarize and disseminate advanced experience in a timely manner, quickly correct deviations and shortcomings in work, and ensure the concrete implementation of the party's guidelines and policies in rural areas. Cross-examination is a good way to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and a good way to implement democratic supervision. It can urge advanced people to continue to move forward, and backward people to learn from the advanced, learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make progress together. Cross-examination is a mass line leadership method and work method for the party committee to rely on grassroots organizations and rely on the masses to promote work. At the same time, it is also a good school for cultivating cadres, improving the political and ideological level of cadres, and improving the work style of cadres."

    交叉检查
    本报记者　商恺
    四十多个乡的党支部书记和乡长挤满了中共平顺县委会的会议室，大家争先汇报这次乡与乡交叉检查工作的结果。
    “我来谈谈检查李家河乡的情况。”回源头乡支部书记张德顺掏出他的日记本，第一个发言了，会议室里立刻静了下来。“李家河有许多值得我们学习的地方：第一，他们认真地执行了县委提出的四项增产措施，所有的秋田里都进行了间作套种，所有的边岸都种上了油料作物；第二，村里村外栽种了许多加拿大杨树，成活率都在90％以上；第三，牲畜饲养管理很好，牲口圈打扫的干干净净，草铡得短，料拌得匀，牲口也喂得胖。……但是，”张德顺抬头看了看大家，又翻了一下他的日记本，继续说道：“我们在李家河也发现了许多问题。”刚刚说了一句，又停了下来。这时候有人在轻轻私语：“听，提到问题就不好意思了。”的确，在这样的大会上，面对面地提出别人工作中的缺点，这对乡干部来说还不那么习惯。但是，张德顺用手巾擦了一下前额，终于讲下去了：“根据我们的检查，猪喂的很不好，有四十多头猪越喂越瘦了；果园管理的也不好，有四十多棵核桃树到了该嫁接的时候，还没有嫁接；全乡修的梯田很多，可是开山荒也不少，足够六十多亩，破坏了水土保持；谷地里缺苗现象很严重，每亩差不多要缺到两千株，有些秋田里草很多，眼看就要荒了，社的干部说人手不够，可是我们看到妇女们还在家里闲着，没有发动起来。”张德顺好像越说越大胆了，这时候他又提到：“我们还发现了一个最严重的问题，农业社半年多不向社员公布账目，社员们不知道自己投资多少，作了多少个劳动日，担心将来是一笔糊涂账，分不下粮食。”最后他又补充了一句：“我们检查的很粗糙，不对的地方请批评。”
    张德顺汇报完了，主持会议的县委副书记杨树培同志接着就问：
  “李家河乡有没有不同的意见？或是还有什么补充？”大家的视线也跟着转移到李家河乡支部书记李发旺身上。李发旺答复说：“回源头乡检查出来的问题都是事实。”但是迟疑了一会，他又说：“谷地缺苗怕是没有那么多，我看每亩顶多不过缺二、三百株。”张德顺不同意李发旺的意见，他说：“李家河乡的许多谷地都是边上稠，中间稀，我们检查的时候，都是挨着步量了的——说是顶多缺二、三百株，那不是事实。”这时候有许多人问李发旺：“光看不行，你仔细步量过吗？”这一问问得李发旺回答不出来，脸上发红，只好说：“我回去再作检查。”
    不知是谁又提出了一个问题：“李家河乡为什么开山荒？难道他们就不懂得开荒是破坏水土保持的吗？”张德顺又补充了一些他们所了解的情况：“今年春天，李家河乡修梯田的计划定的很大，群众正发愁完不成的时候，乡干部便对大家说：“你们想法找窍门啊，”从此，群众便开起荒来。”对这个问题，会议上展开了讨论，这个说：“李家河乡干部是有意识地指点群众开荒。”那个说：“李家河乡干部看见群众开荒不管，当了群众的尾巴。”李家河乡支部书记李发旺不承认是干部有意识地指点群众开荒，因为他们的确没有说过“可以开荒”这句话。但是为什么竟会开了荒呢？上五井乡支部书记吴水清分析的很好，他说：“群众看到修梯田的计划很大，本来就有用开荒来完成计划的想法，这时候，乡干部不去教育群众帮助群众，光叫他们去“找窍门”，这实际是鼓励群众开荒。如果李家河乡的干部对不能开荒这一点认识很明确，那么群众开荒他们为什么不管呢？”
    最后，县委根据大家的意见，作出了对李家河乡的检查结论，指示李家河乡支部书记李发旺回去在支部里传达讨论，把存在的问题一个一个研究解决，并将处理结果报告县委。
    接着发言的是杨威乡支部书记郭聚法，他汇报对赵城乡的检查情况。赵城乡工作中的最突出的成绩是注意了解决群众生活中的困难。但是在农业生产中，有轻视小块地的现象，这在山区来说是很大一个问题。申家坪支部书记郭双德汇报了对龙镇乡的检查情况，那里生产中的主要成绩是积肥多，播种早，所有小块土地和边岸都种上了，但是秋田里缺苗断垅现象却很严重。………会议共进行了三天，每一个乡都进行了汇报，反映了各个方面的情况和问题，听了这些汇报，即便你是刚刚来到平顺县的人，哪里工作先进，哪里工作落后，哪里作出了显著的成绩，哪里存在着严重的缺点。也会一目了然。
    这次交叉检查汇报会议，虽然会议时间较长，会议室又小，但是，参加会议的人情绪始终是饱满的，会场上的空气始终是活跃的。因为经过具体研究分析，大家的头脑清醒了，明确了自己工作中哪些优点该发扬，哪些缺点该纠正，找出了当前工作中的主要问题和解决办法。
    由于乡和乡进行交叉检查我没能赶上参加，不大清楚他们的具体做法，便趁会议的空隙，访问了几个乡支部书记，他们向我介绍了交叉检查的具体过程。概括起来说，交叉检查一般经过以下几个步骤：第一步，乡支部和乡人民委员会，组织本乡农业社和农业社之间的交叉检查，作出各个农业社的检查总结。第二步以乡为单位，民主选派代表，组织检查组，到临近乡进行检查。第三步，检查组到被检查乡后，首先听取党支部介绍本乡情况，接着深入田间实地观察，深入农户座谈访问，学习经验，发现问题。检查完毕以后，向当地支部报告检查结果，共同研究改进措施。第四步，也就是现在正在进行的这一步，检查者和被检查者一同到县进行汇报，开展批评和自我批评，肯定成绩，指出缺点，最后由县委作出检查总结，乡支部贯彻执行。
    听了大会汇报和几个乡支部书记的介绍，我觉得这个交叉检查的办法的确好，但是，交叉检查是怎么提出来的呢？县委副书记杨树培同志告诉我：“交叉检查并不是我们的新创造。在过去，县委检查工作，一般都是抽调县级干部组织检查组下乡检查。由于山高路远，检查人员有限，再加上有些学生出身的干部对农业生产不很熟悉，检查起来既不普遍，又不深入，既不能发现问题，更不能解决问题。我们感到很苦恼。去年在全省农村工作会议上，省委书记陶鲁笳同志介绍了苏联实行交叉检查的工作方法，对我们启发很大，从那以后，我们虽然已经组织过两三次交叉检查了，但都不如这次组织得比较成功。”交叉检查究竟起了哪些作用呢？中共平顺县委在写给省委的报告里，作了这样的概括：“交叉检查可以及时总结和传播先进经验，迅速纠正工作中的偏差和缺点，保证党的方针、政策在农村中具体贯彻执行。交叉检查是开展批评和自我批评的好方式，是实行民主监督的好办法，它可以督促先进者继续前进，落后者向先进者看齐，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同前进。交叉检查是党委依靠基层组织、依靠群众推动工作的群众路线的领导方法和工作方法，同时它又是培养干部、提高干部政治思想水平，改进干部的工作作风的好学校。”
