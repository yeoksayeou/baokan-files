    Making the Leading Organs of Enterprises Closer to the Enterprises
    Visiting the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry of the Ukrainian Republic
    Ji Wei
    Soviet Ukraine's ferrous metallurgy industry occupies a very important position in the entire Soviet Union. In terms of total output, it accounts for: pig iron, 49%; steel, 38%; steel products, 38%; steel pipes, 43%; coke, 54%; iron ore, 55%; manganese, 36%.
    In order to give full play to the initiative of local enterprise leadership, and to make the enterprise leadership organs closer to the enterprises, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to transfer important enterprises in Ukraine, originally directly managed by the Soviet Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry, to the management of the Ukrainian Republic. In 1954, the Ukrainian Republic Council of Ministers established the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry. However, this ministry was not located in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, but in Dnepropetrovsk, a city closer to these enterprises. From the ministry to the 180 enterprises it manages, the closest is only a twenty-minute drive, and the furthest is only four hours.
    The main staff of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry (excluding clerical and other support staff), from the Minister and Deputy Ministers down, frequently go deep into the factories. When we visited the ministry on May 17, the Minister was in Moscow, three of the six Deputy Ministers were in factories, two of the five Bureau Directors were in factories, and 45% of the engineering and technical personnel were also in factories.
    For example, the situation of Comrade Vinogradov, Deputy Minister of the department, going to the factory in the first five months of this year is representative. In January, he stayed at the Southern Ore Mining Company in Krivoy Rog for nine days. In February, he stayed at the mine of the "Dzerzhinsky Mine" Trust in Krivoy Rog for seven days. In March, he went to the mining areas belonging to the "Dzerzhinsky Mine" and "Lenin Mine" trusts twice, for a total of eleven days. In April, he stayed at the Southern Ore Mining Company in Krivoy Rog and the "Communist" factory for five days, and also stayed at the enterprises belonging to the "Nikopol Manganese Mine" Trust in Marganets for four days. In May, he stayed at the enterprises belonging to the "Soviet Non-Metallic Minerals" Trust in Donbass for seven days, and stayed at the "Nikopol Manganese Mine" Trust for two days.
    The main leaders of the ministry frequently going deep into the factories enables them to help the factories discover and solve new problems in a timely manner, and to ensure that new experiences are promoted in a timely manner. In recent years, the ferrous metallurgy enterprises in Ukraine have made great improvements in technology. For example, in iron smelting, increasing the gas pressure in the blast furnace (can increase output by 5%); increasing the humidity of steam in the blast furnace (increases output by 3%); adding oxygen to the blast furnace (increases output by 20%); using new refractory bricks (previously, blast furnaces had to be repaired after every 150 to 200 furnaces, but now they can be repaired after 450 to 500 furnaces). The adoption and promotion of these new methods has been achieved with the help of the ministry's main staff going deep into the factories and helping the factories in all aspects. For example, the ministry learned that the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine in the Ural region had created a new method in iron smelting, which is to add limestone powder when sintering iron ore, which can increase output by 5%. The ministry leaders sent technicians from the Zaporozhye Iron and Steel Plant to study. However, building a limestone grinding factory would take a year. The ministry planned to build a new factory immediately, while also finding a limestone grinding machine to transfer to the factory, first installing the machine in the open air to start grinding limestone powder. In this way, the Zaporozhye plant adopted this new method in less than three weeks.
    Leading modern factories requires high efficiency, and the solution of many major problems requires seizing the time. The enterprise leadership organs being close to the enterprises provides favorable conditions for solving problems in a timely manner. This February, a blast furnace at the Dzerzhinsky Iron and Steel Plant suddenly stopped working. The ministry knew about the shutdown ten minutes later, and the responsible comrades of the ministry immediately went to the factory to conduct research and found that it would take ten days to repair. However, the large amount of sintered ore supplied by the Krivoy Rog plant to this factory continued to be transported. At the same time, the Krivoy Rog plant also supplied sintered ore to two other factories - the Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Plant and the Voroshilov Iron and Steel Plant in Donbass. The ministry immediately contacted these three factories and decided to reduce the supply of ore to the Dzerzhinsky plant during these ten days and increase the balance to the other two factories. This problem was solved on the day of the shutdown. According to the previous leadership relationship, it would have been necessary to report to the Soviet Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry in Moscow, and it would not have been possible to solve it so quickly. For example, last winter, there was a heavy snowfall, and the railway from Krivoy Rog to Dnepropetrovsk was buried in snow, and the ore cars could not run. However, the railway from Donbass to Dnepropetrovsk was normal, and the ministry discussed and decided to transport ore from Donbass, ensuring the ore supply of the Dnepropetrovsk plant. The ore unloading yard of this factory had to unload 1,000 train cars within eight hours, but once, because it was too cold, the ore was frozen in the carriages and could not be unloaded, not only could the empty cars not return to the raw material site on time, but it also disrupted the railway operation. Comrade Balchukov, Deputy Minister of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry, said: Of course, the factory itself cannot solve such problems. If the leading organs are far away from the enterprise, it is difficult to solve them in a timely manner. With the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry close to the enterprise, these problems are quickly resolved.
    Being familiar with the actual situation of each factory and leading according to the characteristics of each factory is the main requirement of the enterprise for the leading organ. Because the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry is close to the enterprises, and the leaders frequently go deep into the factories, they are better able to conduct specific leadership of the enterprises. For example, in reducing the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, the average coefficient in 1954 was 0.89, in 1955 it was 0.85, and this year's plan is 0.79, which had been achieved in April. However, when studying and approving the plans for the blast furnace utilization coefficient of each factory, it is not possible to uniformly follow the lowest coefficient, nor can it be based on the average coefficient, but rather specific indicators must be determined based on the different conditions of each factory's raw material quality and machinery and equipment. One factory had poor raw material quality, and the coefficient was still set at 88%. For example, on the issue of further developing production, new and old factories should not be treated equally. New machines are of course sent to new factories, while installing new machines in old factories may not be in line with the principle of economic accounting. Each factory often starts from the interests of its own factory, while the Ministry of Industry must make decisions based on the interests of the entire country.
    The enterprise leadership organs being close to the enterprises allows the leaders to be closer to the cadres, to understand people more specifically, and to do work on people better. Comrade Balchukov, Deputy Minister of the Ferrous Metallurgy Industry, said: Some experts are suitable for working in the workshop, while others are only suitable for working in the laboratory. In addition, there are others who are more suitable for cultivating talents in schools or doing administrative leadership work. For example, Comrade Vasilyov, the director of the rolling mill workshop of the Dzerzhinsky Iron and Steel Plant, has the talent for leadership work. The comrades in the ministry were familiar with his characteristics and promoted him to the ministry as the director of the rolling research office. After a period of training in his leadership ability, he is now sent to the New Moscow factory to work as the factory director. Comrade Yashinko of the Donbass factory is the director of a small workshop, but his ability can also bear more important work, so he was transferred to a large workshop in the Dnepropetrovsk factory to work as the director. Comrade Kotov, the blast furnace engineer of the General Administration of Metallurgy, has organizational talent, so he was transferred to the Dnepropetrovsk factory to work as the director of the blast furnace workshop. This workshop often failed to complete its production plan last year. After he was transferred to the workshop in September, not only did he complete the plan every month, but he also overfulfilled it.
    Because the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry is close to the enterprises, and most of the staff are often in the enterprises, the staff of the ministry are basically free from the numerous meetings and excessive paperwork, the administrative organs can be greatly streamlined, and capable and technically skilled talents can be sent to directly engage in production and enrich the lower levels. Two years ago, the ministry had a total of 635 main staff (including five administrative bureaus), now there are only 499 people. The ministry also leads the administrative management institutions of its subordinate enterprises to streamline. In the past two years, more than 3,650 engineering and technical personnel and administrative management staff from 180 enterprises have been transferred to production positions.
    Since the establishment of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry two years ago, the output and quality of the metallurgical enterprises under its leadership have made great progress. Comrade Balchukov said: The development of Ukraine's ferrous metallurgy industry cannot be entirely attributed to the leadership of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy Industry, but it is related to the establishment of the Republic's ministry, the location of the ministry in a place close to the enterprises, and the ministry's greater emphasis on going deep into the factories to conduct specific leadership.

    使企业的领导机关接近企业
    访乌克兰共和国黑色冶金工业部
    季委
    苏维埃乌克兰的黑色冶金工业，在全苏联占有很重要的地位：拿总产量来说，生铁，占49％；钢，占38％；钢材，占38％；钢管，占43％；焦炭，占54％；铁矿砂，占55％；锰，占36％。
    为了充分发挥各地方领导企业的积极性，为了使企业的领导机关更接近企业，苏联部长会议决定把原来由苏联黑色冶金工业部直接管理的在乌克兰的重要企业，交给乌克兰共和国管理。1954年乌克兰共和国部长会议成立了黑色冶金工业部。但是这个部不设在乌克兰的首都基辅，而设在更接近这些企业的第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克城。从部里到它所管理的一百八十个企业，最近的只要坐二十分钟汽车，最远的也只要四小时。
    乌克兰黑色冶金工业部的主要工作人员（不包括文书等辅助工作人员），从部长、副部长起，都经常深入工厂。五月十七日我们去访问这个部的时候，部长在莫斯科，六个副部长中有三个在工厂，五个管理局长中有两个在工厂，45％的工程技术人员也都在工厂。
    比如该部副部长维诺格拉多夫同志在今年五个月中到工厂去的情况就是有代表性的。一月份在克里佛伊罗格市的南方选矿公司停留了九天。二月份到“捷尔仁斯基矿”托辣斯在克里佛伊罗格市的矿山停留了七天。三月份曾两次到“捷尔仁斯基矿”和“列宁矿”两托辣斯所属采矿场去，前后共十一天。四月份曾到克里佛伊罗格市南方选矿公司和“共产主义者”工厂停留了五天，同时还在马冈涅茨城“尼科波里锰矿”托辣斯所属企业停留了四天。五月份曾到顿巴斯“苏联非金属矿石”托辣斯所属企业停留了七天，在“尼科波里锰矿”托辣斯停留了二天。
    部的主要领导人员经常深入工厂，就能帮助工厂及时发现和解决新的问题，并使新的经验及时地得到推广。几年来，乌克兰的黑色冶金企业在技术上有很大的改进，比如在炼铁方面，加大高炉内的煤气压力（可以提高产量5％）；增加高炉内蒸气的湿度（提高产量3％）；向高炉内加氧气（提高产量20％）；采用新的耐火砖（以前高炉每炼一百五十到二百炉就要修理，现在可炼四百五十到五百炉才修理）。这些新方法的采用和推广，都是部里的主要工作人员深入工厂，从各方面帮助工厂才得早日实现的。比如：部里知道乌拉尔地区的马格尼托哥尔斯克联合冶金工厂在炼铁时创造了一个新方法，就是在烧结铁矿砂时加上石灰石粉，就可以提高产量5％。部的领导就派萨坡罗什钢铁厂的技术人员去学习。但是建立一个磨石灰石的工厂需要一年，部里一面计划立即建立新厂，一面找磨石灰石的机器调给这个工厂，先在露天地里安上机器开始磨石灰石粉，这样，不到三个礼拜，萨坡罗什厂就采用了这个新方法。
    领导现代化的工厂是需要高度效率的，很多重大问题的解决都需要争取时间。企业的领导机关接近企业，就提供了及时解决问题的有利条件。今年二月，捷尔任斯基钢铁厂的一个高炉忽然停工了。停工十分钟以后部里就知道了，部里的负责同志马上到厂里去进行研究，发现需要十天才能修理好。但是由克里佛伊罗格厂负责供给这个工厂的大量烧结矿砂，仍然源源不断运来。同时克里佛伊罗格厂还供给另外两个工厂——第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克钢铁厂和顿巴斯的伏罗希洛夫钢铁厂烧结矿砂。部里立即和这三个厂联系，决定在这十天内减少对捷尔任斯基厂的矿砂供给，把余额增加给另外两个工厂。这个问题在停工的当天就解决了。按照过去的领导关系，就要报告莫斯科苏联黑色冶金工业部，当然不可能解决得这样迅速。又如去年冬天，有次下大雪，从克里佛伊罗格到第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克的铁路被雪埋了，矿石车不能运行。但是顿巴斯到第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克的铁路是正常的，部里就商量决定从顿巴斯运来矿砂，保证了第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克厂的矿砂供应。这个工厂的卸矿砂的卸车场在八小时内要卸火车车皮一千辆，但有一次因为天太冷，矿砂冻在车厢里卸不下来，不但空车不能按时回到原料地，而且也打乱了铁路运行。乌克兰黑色冶金工业部副部长巴尔楚科夫同志说：这类问题工厂自己当然不能解决，如果领导机关离企业又远，就很难及时解决；黑色冶金工业部靠近企业，这些问题很快就解决了。
    熟悉每个工厂的实际情况，针对每个工厂的特点进行领导，这是企业对领导机关的主要要求。因为乌克兰黑色冶金工业部接近企业，领导人员经常深入工厂，就比较能够对企业进行具体的领导。比如在降低高炉利用系数方面，1954年平均系数是0.89，1955年是0.85，今年计划是0.79，四月份已达到这个指标。但在研究和批准各厂高炉利用系数的计划时，却不能一律按照最低系数，也不能按照平均系数，而是要根据各个厂的原料质量和机器设备等不同的条件决定具体的指标。有一个厂的原料质量不好，系数还是订的88％。又比如进一步发展生产的问题，对新厂和旧厂不应一律看待。新机器当然送给新厂，而旧厂安新机器就不一定合乎经济核算的原则。每个工厂常常只从本厂的利益出发，而工业部就必须以整个国家的利益为出发来作决定。
    企业的领导机关接近企业，领导人员就能更多地接近干部，就能更具体地了解人，就能更好地对人作工作。黑色冶金工业部副部长巴尔楚科夫同志说：有些专家适合于在车间工作，有的又只适合于在实验室工作，另外也有更适合于在学校培养人材，或作行政领导工作的。比如捷尔任斯基钢铁厂轧钢车间的主任瓦西洛同志有领导工作的才干，部里的同志熟悉了他的特点，就提拔他到部里作轧钢研究室的主任，他的领导能力经过一个时期的锻炼以后，现在被派到新莫斯科工厂去作厂长了。顿巴斯厂有一个雅辛科同志是一个小车间的主任，但他的能力还可以担负更重要的工作，因而就调他到第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克厂的一个大车间作主任。冶金总管理局的高炉工程师可托夫同志有组织才能，就调他到第聂伯彼德罗夫斯克厂去作高炉车间的主任。这个车间去年常常完不成生产计划，九月调他去以后，每月不但完成计划，而且还超额完成。
    乌克兰黑色冶金工业部因为接近企业，大部分工作人员又经常在企业里，部里的工作人员基本上摆脱了繁多的会议和过多的文牍来往，行政机关就可能大大精简，有能力有技术的人才就可能被派去直接从事生产，充实下层。两年前，部里一共有六百三十五个主要工作人员（包括五个管理局），现在只有四百九十九人。部里还领导所属各企业的行政管理机构进行精简。两年来，一百八十个企业中有三千六百五十多个工程技术人员和行政管理工作人员调到生产岗位上去工作。
    乌克兰黑色冶金工业部成立两年以来，它所领导下的冶金企业的产量和质量都有很大的进步。巴尔楚科夫同志说：乌克兰黑色冶金业的发展当然不能完全归功于乌克兰黑色冶金工业部的领导，但是这和成立了共和国的部、部设在接近企业的地方、部比较重视深入工厂进行具体领导，是有关系的。
