Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Trade talks between China's import and export corporations and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation began today. In the morning, all participants attended a plenary meeting.

Attending the meeting on the Chinese side were Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and heads of various Chinese import and export corporations.

Attending the meeting from Singapore and Malaya were Goh Teck Huat, head of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, Lee Yan Lian, head of the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, and all members of the two delegations.

At the meeting, Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said in his speech: "China and Singapore-Malaya have a long history of traditional trade relations. However, due to artificial factors, trade has been hampered. The people of Singapore and Malaya, especially those in the business community, have made unremitting efforts to abolish the discriminatory embargo policy against China, and have achieved preliminary success. We express our sincere welcome and support for this effort by the people and business community of Singapore and Malaya."

Li Zhuchen said that the government and people of the People's Republic of China advocate developing commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and the same applies to Singapore and Malaya. There are many commodities that can be exchanged between China and Singapore-Malaya. Singapore and Malaya's rubber, tin, timber, coconuts, etc., are needed by China, and China can supply Singapore and Malaya with various industrial products, food, and native products. Therefore, there is a broad prospect for development on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He wished the trade talks success.

Goh Teck Huat, head of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, and Lee Yan Lian, head of the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce Trade Delegation, also spoke at the meeting. They believed that the visit of the two delegations to China was the beginning of trade development between China and Singapore-Malaya. They agreed to conduct trade negotiations on the principle of mutual benefit and believed that satisfactory results would be achieved.

Mr. David Marshall also attended today's meeting and spoke at the meeting. He believed that the spirit of the Chinese government in receiving these two delegations would greatly help healthy economic relations and mutual friendly relations. He said that China is vigorously carrying out construction to improve people's living standards, and all people sympathize with this. If the Singapore and Malaya delegations can contribute to China in this regard, then we will be very happy.

In the future, trade talks will be conducted in groups.

    新加坡工商业贸易考察团团长高德根、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团团长李延年相继在会上讲了话。他们认为，两个考察团来中国访问，是中国和新加坡、马来亚贸易发展的开端。他们同意在互相有利的原则下进行贸易谈判，并相信一定会获得满意的结果。

    今后，贸易会谈将分组进行。
