    Thoughts on an Untitled Painting
    Zhong Huai
    The April issue of Chongqing’s "Mass Art" magazine published a painting entitled "Happy Farm - Rural Prospects After Twelve Years." In this painting, you can see that twelve years later, the cattle have grown into some kind of behemoth that people can't recognize, the pigs are as large as elephants without noses, and the geese can carry two children on their backs and walk leisurely. You can also see a large pumpkin that requires a truck to carry, a watermelon that six people can't lift, and a corn stalk taller than a nine-step ladder...
    Don't rush to laugh at the painters' overly absurd imagination. Think about whether we ourselves have places of "unfounded fantasy" in our work and planning.
                                    ＊
    The canteen of one factory was poorly run, and the workers often ate spoiled food, so they had many complaints. However, the administrative leader of this factory criticized the workers, saying: "In the past, when crossing the Snowy Mountains and grasslands, tree bark and grass roots were considered good; now that you have rice to eat, you are still picky!"
    The secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in one village, due to having too many concurrent jobs, couldn't attend to production, resulting in his family having no rice to eat and owing a lot of debt. He asked the leadership to reduce some of his work so that he could have more time to participate in production. The leading comrade told him: "If there are difficulties, you must overcome them. Think about the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March, eating grass roots, chewing tree bark, and having to climb snow-capped mountains and cross grasslands. It was much more difficult than you are!"
    Unexpectedly, the 25,000-li Long March has become such a panacea that can be used to counter any reasonable demands people make regarding their living conditions.

    重庆“群众文艺”四月号上登出了一幅画，题目是“幸福的农庄——十二年后的农村远景”。在这幅画中你可以看到，十二年以后，牛已经长成人们认不出来的什么巨兽，猪则大得如同没有鼻子的象，鹅却能够让两个小孩骑在背上而悠哉游哉地走路。你还可以看到一部卡车才能装一个的大南瓜，六个人都掀不动的大西瓜，比九级梯子还高的一个玉米棒子……。
    先别忙笑话画家们的想像过于荒唐。想一想我们自己在做工作、订规划中是不是也有“无根据地胡思乱想”的地方。

    有一个工厂的食堂办得不好，工人常吃馊饭，因此很有意见。这个工厂的行政领导人却批评工人说：“当年过雪山草地，树皮草根都是好的；现在有饭吃，你们还挑剔！”
    有一个农村的青年团总支书记，由于兼职太多，顾不上生产，以致家里没饭吃，还欠了不少债。他请求领导上减轻一点他的工作，让他能有比较多的时间参加生产。领导同志却告诉他：“有困难，就得克服。想一想红军二万五千里长征，吃草根，嚼树皮，还得爬雪山，过草地，比你艰难得多哪！”
    意想不到，二万五千里长征竟成了这样一付万应灵药，可以用来对付人们在生活问题上任何合理的要求。
