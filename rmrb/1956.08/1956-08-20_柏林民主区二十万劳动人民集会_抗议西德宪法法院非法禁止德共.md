Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 19th: Two hundred thousand working people in the Berlin Democratic District held a mass rally on August 18th to strongly protest the West German Federal Constitutional Court's illegal announcement, according to the Adenauer government's wishes, banning the German Communist Party.

The assembly unanimously adopted a protest telegram to the West German Federal Parliament, pointing out that West Germany's path toward Hitler's reign of terror will make the peaceful reunification of Germany impossible. The protest telegram firmly demanded that the Federal Parliament find ways to restore the basic democratic rights that the German Communist Party should enjoy under the West German Constitution, to prevent West Germany from returning to Hitler's reign of terror.

Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party; Hidebrand, Secretary; Materne, Vice Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic; General Staff, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic; Nuschke, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union; and Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, all participated in this meeting.

Stir, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," who is currently visiting the German Democratic Republic, also delivered a speech at the meeting. He guaranteed on behalf of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party that all members of the French Communist Party will forever support the just and patriotic struggle of the German Communist Party.
