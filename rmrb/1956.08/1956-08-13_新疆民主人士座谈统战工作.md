Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 11th: The United Front Work Department of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited more than 40 democratic personages from various ethnic groups and circles in the autonomous region to a forum on the 9th to solicit opinions on the United Front Work.

    At the meeting, everyone agreed that the relationship between the Party organizations in the autonomous region and non-Party members was close. General Tao Zhiyue, a former Kuomintang general and now Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: The Party's unity and assistance to me has been very thoughtful over the past few years, and I am very grateful. I am very excited about the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Nasier, Vice Chairman of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, said: Now the unity between the Party and democratic personages is closer, and it has also helped to eliminate long-term disunity among some democratic personages. He said: I am willing to follow the Party to a communist society.

    Democratic personages attending the meeting also made criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings existing in the United Front Work. Xu Tianyi, Director of the Medical Department of Xinjiang Medical College, said that after the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, the responsibilities of democratic personages have become heavier than before. This requires the Communist Party to strengthen its political assistance and leadership to non-Party members and to have more sincere heart-to-heart talks. It was pointed out at the meeting that the United Front Work had not been well implemented in the work of the CCP grassroots organizations in some units, and a few leading Party cadres had complacency and lacked the necessary trust and importance for senior intellectuals outside the Party, which hindered the full play of the enthusiasm of senior intellectuals.

    The attendees also requested the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to strengthen the inspection of the implementation of the United Front policy by the Party's grassroots organizations and Party member cadres, so as to improve it in time. All attendees hoped to hold more such meetings in the future and adopt various forms.

    Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting at the end. He said that the United Front Work Department of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will seriously study everyone's valuable suggestions and take appropriate measures to improve the United Front Work, so as to strengthen the unity between Party and non-Party members, give full play to everyone's strength, and strive together for the cause of socialist construction.

    新疆民主人士座谈统战工作
    据新华社乌鲁木齐11日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会统一战线工作部九日邀请自治区各族各界民主人士四十多人举行座谈会，征求对统一战线工作的意见。
    会上，大家一致认为自治区的党组织和党外人士的关系是密切的。起义将领、现任中国人民解放军新疆军区副司令员陶峙岳上将说：几年来党对我的团结和帮助是十分周到的，我很感谢。对于“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，我感到很兴奋。政协乌鲁木齐市委员会副主席那思尔说：现在党不仅和民主人士的团结更加紧密了，而且帮助消除了一些民主人士之间的长期不团结现象。他说：我愿意跟着党走到共产主义社会。
    到会民主人士对统一战线工作中存在的缺点也提出了批评和建议。新疆医学院医疗系主任徐天一说，“长期共存，互相监督”的方针提出后，民主人士的责任比以前加重了，这就需要共产党加强对党外人士在政治上的帮助和领导，多作诚恳的谈心。会上有人提出，统一战线工作在某些单位的中共基层组织工作中没能得到很好贯彻，少数党员领导干部有骄傲自满情绪，缺乏对党外高级知识分子应有的信任和重视，妨碍了高级知识分子积极性的充分发挥。
    到会人士还要求中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会，加强对党的各基层组织和党员干部在执行统一战线政策方面的检查工作，以便及时改进。到会人士都希望以后多开这样的会，并采用多种多样的形式。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂最后在会上讲话。他说，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会统一战线工作部将认真研究大家的宝贵建议，并采取适当措施，改进统一战线工作，以加强党和非党人士的团结，发挥大家的力量，共同为社会主义建设事业奋斗。
