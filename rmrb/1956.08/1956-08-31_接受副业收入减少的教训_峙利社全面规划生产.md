Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 29th: Recently, the Zhili Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ningming County, Guangxi Province, combined its summer harvest pre-distribution with mobilizing its members to summarize their work since the establishment of the cooperative, thereby promoting production.

The Zhili Cooperative achieved a bumper harvest this summer, and the distribution results showed that 99.8% of the members received more grain than last year. However, because sideline production was not done well in the first half of the year, income was very low, so the members' lives still did not improve much. In this situation, some cooperative cadres even developed complacency, even one-sidedly believing that focusing only on grain production in the first half of the year was "grasping the main point correctly."

In response to this situation, the Zhili Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party led the cooperative to summarize its work in the first half of the year in conjunction with the summer harvest pre-distribution and mobilized members to start discussions. During the discussions, the members affirmed the achievements in agricultural production, but also sharply criticized the cooperative's leadership for neglecting sideline production. Members pointed out that the Zhili Cooperative is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and can greatly develop various sideline industries such as raising pigs, cattle, ducks, and fish. However, because cooperative cadres only focused on agricultural production and neglected the leadership of sideline production, they also criticized the members who engaged in household sideline production for wanting to "eat without working, like landlords." As a result, the cooperative's income in the first half of the year decreased by more than 70% compared to previous years.

After the discussion, the branch also led the cooperative's management committee to revise the annual production plan based on the members' suggestions. The plan now calls for strengthening field management of intermediate and late rice while rationally allocating and using labor for sideline production, requiring increased production in autumn and winter agriculture and sideline industries. At the same time, based on the members' opinions, methods for improving the cooperative's leadership and management were also proposed. In this way, the members' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. In the current manure accumulation campaign, the attendance rate of members has increased from about 80% in the past to almost 100%.

### 接受副业收入减少的教训  峙利社全面规划生产

    接受副业收入减少的教训
    峙利社全面规划生产
    新华社南宁29日电　最近，广西省宁明县峙利农业生产合作社结合夏收预分，发动社员总结了建社以来的工作，从而推动了生产。
    峙利社今年夏收丰产，分配结果，99.8％的社员分得的粮食比去年多，但是，因为上半年副业生产搞的不好，收入很少，因此社员生活仍然没有多大改善。在这种情况下，有些社干部还产生了自满情绪，竟片面地认为：上半年只注意粮食生产是“抓对了头”。
    中共峙利乡支部针对这种情况，领导这个社结合夏收预分总结了上半年的工作，并且发动社员展开讨论。在讨论中，社员肯定了农业生产的成绩，也尖锐地批评了社的领导上放松副业生产的缺点。社员们指出：峙利社周围有山有水，可以大量发展养猪、牛、鸭以及养鱼等各种副业，但是因为社干部只顾农业生产而放松了对副业生产的领导；还批评经营家庭副业的社员，是想“像地主一样，光吃不劳动。”结果，全社上半年的收入比往年减少了70％以上。
    讨论结束后，支部又领导社管理委员会根据社员的建议，重新修订了全年生产规划，计划今后在加强中、晚稻田间管理的同时，要合理调配使用劳动力用于副业生产，要求秋、冬农、副业生产都能增产。同时，还根据社员意见提出了改进社的领导和经营管理的办法。这样，社员生产积极性大大提高，在当前的积肥运动中，社员的出工率由过去的80％差不多提高到100％。
