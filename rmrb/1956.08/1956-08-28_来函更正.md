Letter of Correction

In the news of the closing of the aviation model competition published on the fourth page on the 24th, there are two corrections to be made: 1. In the beginning of the third paragraph, the "two" in "obtained a second level, tethered model..." is a mistake and should be "three"; 2. One sports result was omitted, namely "The first place in the second-level tethered model glider was won by Wu Qihua from the Tianjin team, the second place was won by Huang Zuoyi from the Shenyang team, and the third place was won by Zhang Zhengyu from the Xi'an Aviation Institute team."

    来函更正
    24日第四版刊载的航空模型竞赛大会闭幕的消息中，有两处需要更正：一、第三段开头“获得二级，牵引模型……”中的“二”字系“三”之误；二、遗漏了一项运动成绩，即“获得二级牵引模型滑翔机第一名的是天津队吴企华，第二名是沈阳队黄作义，第三名是西安航空学院代表队的章正瑜。”
