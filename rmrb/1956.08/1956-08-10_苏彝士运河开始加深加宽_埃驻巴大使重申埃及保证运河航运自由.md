    Suez Canal Begins Deepening and Widening
    Egyptian Ambassador to Pakistan Reaffirms Egypt's Guarantee of Freedom of Navigation

    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th -- TASS, Cairo, August 8th: According to the orders of the Egyptian authorities, the work of widening and deepening the Suez Canal waterway has begun. After the completion of the project, the canal will be able to accommodate giant ships with a displacement of 55,000 tons.

    According to Mahmoud Younis, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, the canal reconstruction plan is scheduled to be completed in five years. The cost of the project is 20 million Egyptian pounds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi: Egyptian Ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Hamid Shaukat, said here on August 8th that the Western countries' fears that Egypt will cut off or obstruct Suez Canal traffic should not exist because "Egypt is concerned about developing Suez Canal traffic."

    He said, "Egypt has announced more than once that it is determined to guarantee the freedom of navigation on this canal. This guarantee is not at all contradictory to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company."

    When he mentioned the Western countries' threat to impose an economic blockade on Egypt, he said, "Egypt is prepared to cope with all eventualities. Foreign investment in Egypt is indeed a considerable sum, while Egypt's investment abroad is relatively small."

    He also said that he had held talks with responsible officials of the Pakistani government on the Suez Canal issue.

    苏彝士运河开始加深加宽
    埃驻巴大使重申埃及保证运河航运自由
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社开罗八日消息：根据埃及当局的命令，苏彝士运河航道加宽和加深的工作开始了。工程完工以后，运河可以通行排水量达五万五千吨的巨轮。
    据苏彝士运河管理委员会主席马哈茂德·尤尼斯宣布，运河改建计划预定五年完成。工程费用为两千万埃镑。
    据新华社喀喇蚩电　埃及驻巴基斯坦大使阿卜杜勒·哈迈德·沙特八月八日在这里说，西方国家害怕埃及将会切断或阻挠苏彝士运河交通的疑惧不应当存在，因为“埃及关心的是发展苏彝士运河的交通”。
    他说，“埃及已经不止一次地宣布，它决心保证这条运河的航运自由。这种保证同把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是毫不矛盾的。”
    他在提到西方国家对埃及实行经济封锁威胁的时候说，“埃及准备应付一切不测的事情。外国在埃及的投资的确是一笔可观的数目，而埃及在外国的投资却是相当少的。”
    他还说，他已经就苏彝士运河问题和巴基斯坦政府的负责官员们举行了会谈。
