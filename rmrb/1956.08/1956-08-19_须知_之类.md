"Must Know" and the Like
    Hàn Fū

Nowadays, there are many "must know" notices. There are "Passenger Instructions" on trams, "Guest Instructions" in hotels, and "Visitor Instructions" in government offices. The original intention of these "must know" texts was nothing more than to make things convenient for others and for oneself. However, based on personal observation, it is not easy to make the "must know" truly concise and comprehensive and convenient for people. On the other hand, being verbose and cumbersome and becoming an artificial stumbling block is the most common problem. How do I know? Please see the "Visitor Instructions" of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives:

    1. Visiting Hours: Visitors should contact us during working hours; no visitors are received after work.
    2. After being questioned by the gatekeeper, if the visitor is indeed here to discuss work with the Federation, they should first go to the reception room and explain their purpose and who they intend to meet with or which department to the receptionist.
    3. Visitors must fill out a "Visitor Registration Form" in detail (note: the form includes items such as: name, age, position, gender, work unit, address, phone number, name of the person being visited, unit, relationship, purpose, carried items, time of arrival at the Federation, ... everything is included) and submit it to the receptionist, then wait in the reception room for notification of the meeting location.
    4. Visitors are not allowed to wander around the compound at will.
    5. After the visit, the visitor must have the person being visited sign the "Visitor Registration Form" and present it to the gatekeeper for verification before being allowed to leave.
    6. Except for those who must meet in the office for official business, no one is allowed to meet in the office.
    7. Non-Federation staff members should meet in the reception room and are not allowed to be brought into the compound.
    8. Federation cadres generally should not meet with relatives and friends during working hours; after work, they can go to the cadre dormitories, but are not allowed to wander around the compound.
    9. Visitors carrying documents or items should have the receiving department issue a "Document Carrying Certificate" or "Item Carrying Certificate" for the gatekeeper to verify before being allowed to leave.
    10. If the matter needs to be handled directly by the head of the Federation, the letter of introduction must be given to the head's secretary to arrange a meeting time; if the secretary believes that the head does not need to handle it, it can be directly transferred to the relevant department.

Indeed, some of these are necessary to know and should be followed, because the government office is certainly not an unmanaged courtyard. But to draft a "Visitor Instructions" with as many as ten articles is really quite impressive. May I ask, those who create these legal regulations, when you drafted these official documents, did you ever think of the difficulties faced by visitors? The lament of Kuang Zhong, "The gates of the powerful are as deep as the sea; seeing a noble person is so difficult," should be carefully considered!

    “须知”之类
    汗夫
    现在，“须知”很多。电车上有“乘客须知”，旅馆里有“旅客须知”，机关里有“会客须知”。这些“须知”之类的文字，起初的立意，无非是为了与人方便、自己方便。不过，据个人的观察，使“须知”之类真正做到简而赅、与人方便，实在不易；而繁复累赘成为人为的绊脚石，却又是最容易犯的通病。怎见得？请看供销合作总社的“会客须知”：
    一、会客时间：来宾接洽工作应在上班时间，下班不会客。
    二、来宾经门卫询问后，确系来本社接洽工作的，应先到传达室，向传达员说明来意及拟会见何部门或何人。
    三、来宾必须详细填写“会客登记证”（注：该证项目有：姓名、年龄、职务、性别、服务机关、住址、电话号码、接见人姓名、单位、关系、事由、携带物品、来本社时间、……应有尽有）交传达员，然后到接待室等候通知会见地点。
    四、来宾不得任意进入院内游览。
    五、来宾会客完毕后，须请接见人在“会客登记证”上签名，到门卫查验放行。
    六、除因公必须在办公室会客者外，一律不得在办公室会客。
    七、非本社工作人员会客请到接待室，不得引入院内。
    八、本社干部一般不得在上班时会见亲友，下班后可到干部宿舍，不得在院内游览。
    九、来宾携带文件或物品，应由接见部门开具“携带文件证”或“携带物品证”，交门卫查验后放行。
    十、如事情需要首长直接办理的，须将介绍信交首长秘书，约定时间会见；如秘书认为不需首长办理，可径直转有关部门。
    这其中的确有些是必须知道而且应该照章办事的，因为机关究竟不是无人管的大杂院。但是将一个“会客须知”拟至多达十条，也实在够可观的了。敢问，那些制科定律的人，当您具文立法时，可曾想到会客者的难处？况钟的“侯门深似海，见贵人，如此艰难”的感慨，倒是应该仔细玩味的呢！
