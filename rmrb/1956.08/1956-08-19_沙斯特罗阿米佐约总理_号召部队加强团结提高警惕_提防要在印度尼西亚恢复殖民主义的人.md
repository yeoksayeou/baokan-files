Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th—Indonesian Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Sastroamidjojo, on the evening of August 17th, called on the armed forces to strengthen unity and remain vigilant, guarding against the forces created by those who seem to want to restore colonialism in this country by adopting methods that pit one group against another.

In this special broadcast address to the armed forces on Indonesian Independence Day, he also asked officers and soldiers to continue to be dutiful to the country and asked armed forces personnel to abide by discipline.

Sastroamidjojo pointed out that the armed forces are currently being included in the government's plan to restore domestic security, as domestic security is being disrupted by armed bandits due to the inadequacy of the police force.

He said that illegal armed bandits and insurgents, recognizing their obligation to help build the Republic of Indonesia, have begun to surrender to the authorities. This is a gratifying phenomenon.

He said: The Indonesian government is paying due attention to the necessity of reorganizing the armed forces in order to make the troops more perfect.

    提防要在印度尼西亚恢复殖民主义的人
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总理兼国防部长沙斯特罗阿米佐约在八月十七日晚间号召武装部队加强团结，保持警惕，提防那些似乎想采取使一个集团反对另一个集团的办法来在这个国家恢复殖民主义的人们所造成的势力。
    他在印度尼西亚独立日向武装部队发表的这篇特别广播演说中，还要求军官和士兵继续对国家尽责，要求武装部队人员遵守纪律。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，武装部队目前正在被包括在政府的恢复国内安全的计划内，由于警察部队不够，国内安全正受到武装匪徒的扰乱。
    他说，非法的武装匪徒和叛乱分子由于认识到他们有义务帮助建设印度尼西亚共和国，已经开始向当局投降。这是令人高兴的现象。
    他说：印度尼西亚政府正在适当注意整编武装部队的必要性，以便使部队更趋完善。
