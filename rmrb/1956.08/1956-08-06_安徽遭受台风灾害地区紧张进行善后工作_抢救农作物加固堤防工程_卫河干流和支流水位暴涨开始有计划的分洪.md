Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 5th: The people of Anhui Province engaged in an extremely tense struggle against the wind and to mitigate disaster during the strong typhoon that struck Anhui.

Before the typhoon entered Anhui, the CCP committees at all levels in Anhui Province, based on weather forecasts, issued urgent instructions, mobilizing all localities to fully engage in wind prevention and disaster relief. All special districts and counties held emergency telephone conferences, and many CCP county secretaries and county heads immediately went to the countryside to lead the work of wind prevention and disaster relief. In order to reduce crop losses, the Wuhu Special District alone had more than one million farmers rushing to harvest early rice and other crops. When the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Langxi County received the typhoon warning, it immediately mobilized more than 900 cooperative members to use bamboo poles and ropes to press down the rice to prevent the typhoon from damaging it. More than 5,000 cooperative members of the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanling County braved the wind and rain to harvest early rice. In Hefei, more than 500 cooperative members of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative braved the heavy wind and rain to cut the ripe early rice. Yang Jiyu, the cooperative director, slipped and fell in the rice field, breaking his arm, but still participated in the harvesting. In the cities, factories and warehouses organized protective and emergency rescue organizations to patrol in shifts. Protective props were erected for potentially dangerous houses and construction sites. Flood prevention work was generally strengthened on the dikes of the Yangtze River, the Huai River, and many inland rivers.

Due to the prior strengthening of wind prevention preparations and the heroic struggle of the people in all localities during the typhoon, the inevitable serious losses brought by the typhoon were considerably reduced. For example, during the typhoon's assault, the Ma'anshan Iron Mine, and factories in Wuhu, Hefei, Bengbu and other cities continued production as usual. Dilapidated houses in the countryside, due to prior use of ropes to net them and make certain wind prevention preparations, suffered reduced losses.

The typhoon that struck Anhui this time was very strong and affected a wide area. From south to north, the impact of the wind deeply affected the entire province. This typhoon also lasted for a relatively long time, totaling three days. Due to the particularly strong wind, the province suffered severe losses. Rice on both sides of the Yangtze River, and crops such as sorghum and corn in the Huaibei region, were mostly flattened. In Anqing Special District alone, more than 1.8 million mu of early and mid-season rice were flattened, with an estimated 5% to 10% grain loss. In Jieshou County, Huaibei, 20% of the flattened sorghum was threshed. In Shucheng County, the Hangbu River caused flash floods due to heavy rain, and five breaches occurred at Laoheba, Renjiawan, and other places, affecting 75,000 farmers. According to incomplete statistics from Wuhu, Bengbu, Lu'an, Fuyang, and other special districts, 320,000 houses were blown down or damaged by the typhoon, and more than 80 farmers died and more than 530 were injured. More than 160,000 trees were blown down in Fuyang Special District.

Now, the typhoon has left Anhui. Local Party and government organizations are comforting the people in the disaster areas, and the injured have been successively sent to hospitals for treatment. The Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture has issued instructions to urgently rescue crops blown down by the typhoon. Reinforcement work is underway on the dikes of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. The aftermath work in the wind-affected areas throughout the province is being carried out in a planned manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th: The water levels of the Wei River's main stream and its tributaries have risen sharply. The Zhang River and Qi River tributaries have experienced extraordinarily large floods, and the Wei River and Zhang River have begun planned flood diversion.

In the upper reaches of the Wei River and its tributaries in northern Henan Province and southeastern Shanxi Province, continuous rainfall has occurred since the 28th of last month, resulting in consistently high water levels in the Wei River and its tributaries. Due to the influence of the typhoon, heavy rainfall occurred in these areas. From 8:00 on the 3rd to 8:00 on the 4th, Hejian in Linxian County, northern Henan, received 229.6 mm of rainfall. Other areas also received more than 100 mm, causing the water levels of the Wei River's main stream and tributaries to rise sharply. The flow rate at Guantai on the Zhang River, the largest tributary of the Wei River, suddenly increased to 8,600 cubic meters per second at 1:00 on the 4th, exceeding the guaranteed flow rate of 5,600 cubic meters per second, resulting in the largest flood on the Zhang River since water level records began. The flow rate at Xincun on the Qi River tributary of the Wei River reached 4,010 cubic meters per second on the night of the 3rd, which was also the largest flood since water level records began. The 1,400 cubic meters per second flow rate on the Anyang River tributary was also a rare flood. The flow rate of the Wei River also experienced a corresponding sharp increase.

After the flood occurred, a member of the CCP Anyang Local Working Committee went to Junxian County to direct flood prevention, and the commissioner of the Xinxiang Prefectural Office braved the rain to direct dike work in Jixian County. Eight hundred thousand people in the five counties along the Wei River braved the rain to go to the dikes overnight.

However, the river water was far greater than the effective flood discharge capacity of the river channel. In order to reduce disasters, planned flood diversion was implemented. After the Wei River diverted floodwaters to the Baishipo flood detention area, under the instructions of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, the Zhang River also began diverting floodwaters southward at Erfenzhuang in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, at 2:30 on the 4th. By 6:00 p.m. on the 4th, the flow rate at Guantai on the Zhang River had dropped to 4,720 cubic meters per second, and the flow rate at Xincun on the Qi River had also dropped to 1,800 cubic meters per second. Only the flow rate at Jixian County on the Wei River was still increasing.

Villages near the diversion inlets have flood prevention village dikes. In areas far from the diversion inlets, the masses in villages in low-lying areas have already transferred to villages in higher areas under the leadership of cadres at all levels.

    安徽遭受台风灾害地区紧张进行善后工作
    抢救农作物加固堤防工程
    卫河干流和支流水位暴涨开始有计划的分洪
    新华社合肥5日电　安徽省全省人民在强台风袭击安徽时，进行了极其紧张的防风抢险斗争。
    在台风进入安徽境内以前，中共安徽省各级党委即根据气象预报发出紧急指示，动员各地全力投入防风抢险。各专区和县都召开了紧急的电话会议，很多县的中共县委书记、县长，都立即到农村中领导防风抢险工作。为了减少农作物的损失，仅芜湖专区就有一百多万农民突击抢收早稻和其他农作物。郎溪县幸福农业社在接到台风警报时，立即动员九百多社员用竹竿拉绳子把稻子压倒，以防台风刮坏稻子。南陵县新光农业社有五千多社员冒着风雨抢收早稻。合肥市光明农业社五百多社员冒着狂风暴雨抢割成熟的早稻，社主任杨继余滑倒在稻田里，跌破了胳膊，仍然参加抢收。在城市里，各工厂、仓库都组织了防护抢险组织，轮流值班巡逻。可能有危险的房屋、工地，都搭起了防护撑杆。长江、淮河和许多内河的堤防，普遍加强了防汛工作。
    由于事先加强了防风准备工作以及各地人民在台风到来时的英勇斗争，相当地减少了这次台风所带来的不可避免的严重损失。如台风袭击期间，马鞍山铁矿，芜湖、合肥、蚌埠等城市的工厂，仍然照常生产。农村中的破旧房屋，由于事先用绳子网起来，作了一定的防风准备，减少了损失。
    这次袭击安徽的台风非常强大，影响的范围很广。由南而北，风力的影响深及了全省。这次台风持续的时间也比较长，前后共计三天。由于风力特别强大，全省受的损失仍然很严重。长江两岸的水稻，淮北地区的高粱、玉米等农作物，大部分倒伏。仅安庆专区就有一百八十多万亩早稻和中稻倒伏，脱粒的估计一般有5％到10％。淮北界首县倒伏的高粱，脱粒的占20％。舒城县杭埠河因暴雨发生山洪，老河坝、任家湾等五处破圩，受灾农民七万五千人。据芜湖、蚌埠、六安、阜阳等专区不完全的统计，被台风刮倒刮坏的房屋达三十二万间，农民死亡八十余人，伤五百三十多人。阜阳专区被刮倒的树木达十六万多棵。
    现在，台风已经离开安徽地区。各地党政组织正慰问受灾地区的人民，负伤的人已经陆续送入医院医治。安徽省农业厅发出指示，紧急抢救被台风刮倒的农作物。江淮堤防正在进行加固工程。全省各地受风灾地区的善后工作，正在有计划的进行。
    新华社郑州5日电　卫河干流及其支流水位一齐暴涨，支流漳河和淇河出现特大洪水，卫河和漳河已经有计划地分洪。
    河南省北部和山西省东南部的卫河及其支流的上游地区，从上月二十八日后，连续降雨，以至卫河及其支流的水位一直很高。由于台风的影响，这些地区普降暴雨。从三日八时到四日八时豫北林县合涧降雨二二九·六公厘，其他地区也在一百公厘以上，因而卫河干流和支流水位纷纷猛涨。卫河最大支流漳河观台的流量在四日一时陡涨到八千六百秒公方，超过保证流量五千六百秒公方，造成漳河自有水位纪录以来的最大洪水。卫河支流淇河新村在三日夜出现了四千零十秒公方的流量，也是自有水位纪录以来未曾有过的大水。支流安阳河出现的一千四百秒公方流量也是少有的洪水。卫河流量也有相应的猛涨。
    洪水出现后，中共安阳地方工作委员会的一个委员到浚县指挥防汛，新乡专署的专员冒雨到汲县指挥堤防工作，卫河沿线的五个县有八万群众连夜冒雨上堤防守。
    但因河水大的远远超过河道有效的排洪量。为了减少灾害就有计划的实行分洪。卫河向白寺坡止洪区分洪后，在中央防汛总指挥部的指示下，漳河也于四日二时三十分在河北省临漳县二分庄向南分洪。到四日十八时漳河观台的流量已经下降到四千七百二十秒公方，淇河新村的流量也落到一千八百秒公方；只有卫河汲县的流量还呈涨势。
    分洪口门外附近的村庄都有防洪围村堤，距离分洪口远的地区，低洼地带村庄的群众，已经在各级干部领导下转入到高阜地带的村庄。
