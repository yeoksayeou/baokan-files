Our correspondent in the Soviet Union, Hu Sisheng

On May 6, 1955, Soviet technical science master and honored athlete Polikarpov announced to nearly a hundred foreign journalists in Paris that in one year, a sports city with a capacity of 160,000 spectators and various modern facilities would be built in Luzhniki, Moscow. Many people openly expressed doubt, believing this was impossible.

Indeed, if you climbed Lenin Hills a year ago and looked down, you would only see the Moscow River extending her slender arms, embracing a piece of land dotted with farmhouses, which was Luzhniki. But today, if you climb Lenin Hills again, just as described in fairy tales, the farmhouses and fields are gone, and a magnificent sports city has appeared before your eyes...

	The Grand Stadium

Along the tree-lined avenue, we entered the center of the city. Here is the Grand Stadium, with a football field and running track in the middle, and terraced sloping stands around it. The stands have a total of 150 steps, or 73 rows, and can accommodate 100,300 spectators. If you are interested in walking around each row of the stands and do not rest midway, your entire working day will be canceled, because its total length is 80 li. The person who designed the stands said that we are very strict about the width of each seat, because if the width of each seat differs by one centimeter, the length of the entire stand will differ by one kilometer. Looking up, you can see a huge silver-gray "brim" extending towards the field at the top of the stands, which is 10 meters wide. It is said that this has three major functions: for the audience, it prevents rain and sun; for athletes (especially track and field athletes), it prevents the strong wind blowing from Lenin Hills; and for photographers and television cameramen, it is the best location for capturing full-field shots. At the same time, 500 powerful searchlights are installed on this "brim", so that the game of football will not be hindered after night falls. Standing on the top of the stands and looking down, the green grass of the football field is inlaid in the middle of the red running track, which is very beautiful. The running track is made of water-permeable bricks, cinder and other materials in a certain proportion, and is not affected by the weather. Automatic recording boards are erected in the stadium, and the results of the ball games and track and field events held in the stadium can be promptly told to the audience through the "electric characters" on the recording boards.

Below this grand stand is a four-story building. It has a thousand rooms of various sizes, with a total area of 80,000 square meters. On the ground floor, there are dressing rooms, cloakrooms, shower rooms, bathhouses, medical rooms, referee rooms, running track practice fields, and post and telecommunications rooms. The second floor is mainly for serving the audience, where they can rest, and there are 36 snack bars, as well as a sports museum, automatic telephone booths, and newspaper stands. The third floor is the athletes' training place, with 14 halls for athletes to use, as well as two dining halls and two cinemas. The fourth floor is the location of the "News House".

	Small Stadium, Swimming Pool and Indoor Sports Palace

The small stadium is a place for various sports competitions, but when you walk in, it seems that there are no multiple venues for multiple competitions. The commentator gave an explanation of how the venue would be used in the future, which solved the mystery: a basketball game is over, and the players have left the field, but in front of the 16,500 spectators in the small stadium, the basketball court is converted into a boxing ring, and as soon as the bell rings, the boxers come out to fight. It turns out that the venue here is movable, and in a very short period of time, it can be assembled into volleyball courts, tennis courts, wrestling venues, etc., according to needs. We approached the swimming pool. There are a total of four swimming pools here. Two are outdoor and two are indoor. In the outdoor swimming pool, one is 50 meters long and 22 meters wide, which is exclusively for swimming competitions and water polo games, and the other is for diving competitions. There are stands with 13,000 seats around these two swimming pools. What is thought-provoking is that a special glass window with a length of 8 meters is opened on the wall under the water of the former swimming pool, so that the coach can observe the underwater movements of the athletes from here and issue instructions via radio.

The indoor sports palace is a part of the entire sports city building, but it will not be fully completed until the end of this year. The commentator told us: The sports venues here can also be changed. For example, after an ice hockey game and a figure skating performance, if needed, the ice can be quickly melted and then assembled into a volleyball court or tennis court.

	International Level

A friend who has seen large stadiums in various countries in the world said that this sports city is first-class. He listed the general situation of sports venues in various countries with international standards: The Berlin Grand Stadium can accommodate 100,000 spectators, and there are swimming pools, one or two tennis courts, and five football fields. The Rome Stadium covers an area of 40 hectares and can accommodate 90,000 spectators, of which 33,500 people can only stand and watch. The Melbourne Stadium, the site of this year's Olympic Games, is also smaller than this stadium in Moscow.

When I was about to leave the sports city, I received a written material about the stadium, which printed some interesting figures: The Moscow Central Stadium is located in Luzhniki, covering an area of 180 hectares, with 130 buildings, which can provide 2,000 athletes to conduct various competitions at the same time, and can accommodate 160,000 spectators at the same time. The construction project lasted 450 days. During these days, 3 million cubic meters of earth were excavated. If these earthworks were loaded onto three-ton trucks, the line of trucks could stretch from Moscow to Vladivostok. The Central Stadium has eleven football fields, four running tracks, twenty-nine tennis courts, sixteen volleyball courts, fifteen basketball courts, twenty-one gymnastics halls and ball sports halls, seven halls for boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, and fencing, four swimming pools, five figure skating rinks... Reading this, I suddenly realized that although it took a lot of time, I only saw a part of this sports city.

    体育城
    本报驻苏联记者　胡思升
    1955年5月6日，苏联技术科学硕士、功勋运动员波利卡尔波夫在巴黎向近百名外国记者宣告，一年之后，在莫斯科的卢日尼基将建成一座可以容纳十六万观众、有种种现代化设备的体育城的时候，很多人公开表示怀疑，认为这是不可能的。
    的确，如果你在一年前登上列宁山向下眺望，只见到莫斯科河伸出她那纤细的双臂，环抱着一块点缀有农舍的土地，这就是卢日尼基。但是，今天你再一次登上列宁山，正像童话里所描写的那样，农舍、田园不见了，一座气魄雄伟的体育城已经呈现在你的眼前……。
       大体育场
    沿着林荫大道，我们走进了城的中心。这里是大体育场，中间是足球场和跑道、四周是梯状的斜坡看台。看台一共有一百五十级，即七十三排，可以容纳观众十万零三千人。如果你有兴趣绕看台的每一排走一圈并且中途不休息的话，你的整整一个工作日就勾销了，因为它的总长度是八十华里。设计看台的人说，我们对每个座位的宽窄定得很严格，因为每个座位的宽窄只要相差一公分的话，整个看台的长度就会相差一公里。抬头看去，可以看到看台顶端有一块向场内伸展出来的巨大的银灰色“帽檐”，宽达十公尺。据说，这有三大功用：对观众来说，防止雨淋日晒，对运动员（特别是田径运动员）来说，防止从列宁山吹来的劲风，对摄影记者和电视摄影师来说是猎取全场镜头的最好的位置。同时，在这个“帽檐”上装设有五百盏强烈的探照灯，这样，夜幕降临以后也不会妨碍赛足球了。站在看台的顶上向下看，足球场的绿色草地嵌在红色的跑道中间，煞是美观。跑道是由透水砖、煤渣等材料按一定比例砌成的，可以不受天气的影响。在体育场上竖起自动化的记录板，在体育场上进行的球赛、田径赛的成绩都能及时地通过记录板上的“电字”告诉观众。
    这个大看台的下面，是一个四层的建筑物。它有一千间大小房间，总面积八万平方公尺。在底层有换衣间、衣帽间、淋浴间、澡堂、医疗间、裁判室、跑道练习场、邮电室。二楼主要是为观众服务的，这里可以休息，有三十六个小食部，此外有体育博物馆、自动电话室、书报摊等。三楼是运动员练习的场所，这里有十四个大厅供运动员使用，还有二个食堂和两个电影院。四楼是“新闻之家”的所在地。
    小体育场、游泳池和室内体育宫
    小体育场是进行多种体育竞赛的场所，但是走进去一看，似乎没有供多种竞赛用的多种场地。讲解员对将来怎样使用场地作了一番解释，才解开了这个谜：一场篮球赛结束了，球员离场了，但是，在小体育场的一万六千五百个观众面前，篮球场转换成了拳击场，铃声一响，拳击运动员就出场交锋了。原来，这里的场地是活动的，在很短的时间内，可根据需要装配成排球场、网球场、摔跤场等等场地。我们走近了游泳池。这里一共有四个游泳池。二个是露天的，二个是室内的。在露天的游泳池中，一个长五十公尺、宽二十二公尺的，专供游泳比赛和水球赛之用，另一个供跳水比赛用。这两个游泳池的周围有一万三千个座位的看台。耐人寻味的是，在前一个游泳池的水下，在壁上开了个长达八公尺的特制玻璃窗，教练可以从这里观察运动员的水下动作，并用无线电发出指示。
    室内体育宫是整个体育城建筑的一部分，不过它要今年年底才能全部完工。讲解员对我们说：这里的体育场地也是可以变换的，例如，在冰球赛和花样溜冰表演后，如果需要，冰可以很快融化，然后装配成排球场或网球场。
        国际水平
    见识过世界各国的大运动场的朋友说，这个体育城是属于第一流的。他列举了有国际水平的各国体育场的概貌：柏林大运动场可以容十万观众，那里有游泳池、一两个网球场和五个足球场。罗马体育场占地四十公顷，可容九万观众，其中三万三千五百人只能站着看。今年奥林匹克运动会的所在地墨尔本运动场也小于莫斯科的这个运动场。
    快要离开体育城时，我拿到一份关于运动场的书面材料，上面印着这样一些有趣的数字：莫斯科中央运动场位于卢日尼基，占地一八○公顷，建筑物一三○幢，能同时供二千运动员进行各项比赛，同时可容纳十六万观众。建筑工程进行了四五○天，在这些天内，挖土三百万立方公尺，如果把这些土方装上三吨重的卡车，卡车的行列可以从莫斯科一直排到海参崴。中央运动场有十一个足球场、四条跑道，二十九个网球场，十六个排球场，十五个篮球场，二十一个体操厅和球类运动厅，七个供拳击、摔跤、举重、击剑用的大厅，四个游泳池，五个花样溜冰场……。读到这里，我才恍然大悟，虽然花了不少时间，但是，我才看到了这个体育城的一部分。（附图片）
