Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, August 18th (Xinhua reporter Ma Xinren): The wheat harvest at the state-owned Friendship Farm has entered its peak. The machines operating in every stage of the wheat harvesting process have transformed the farm into an agricultural factory.

When the tractor drivers, who had been plowing the fields all night, detached the five-furrow plows and drove their machines back to the work stations from the fields, hundreds of combine harvesters across the farm were being prepared for the day's work in each production team. The whistles of the combine harvesters sounded, and the red, automatic harvesters and the gray "C-6" tractor-pulled harvesters entered the wheat fields one after another. From a distance, the magnificent combine harvesters looked like ships sailing rapidly on a golden ocean. Standing on the operating platform of a "C-6" combine harvester, one could appreciate the astonishing efficiency of the harvesting machine. The ripe wheat stalks bent under the wooden turning wheels, and the 4.9-meter-wide, hair clipper-like cutter swiftly severed the stalks. The wheat falling onto the harvesting platform was instantly transported into the belly of the machine by a conveyor belt. Before you could hesitate and turn your head to look to the left, the threshed wheat had already been discharged into the grain bin by the elevator. The sieved weeds and seeds fell into a bag through a duct. The straw and chaff were scattered from the rear of the harvester. In no more than fifty minutes, the grain bin, which could hold about two tons of grain, was full, and the combine harvester driver's assistant waved a flag. A truck arrived. After being filled with grain, the truck drove to the drying ground.

On the drying ground, the mobile power station hummed. Weighing was the first step here. The truck drove onto the iron plate of the ground scale, and the lever of the scale jumped up. In two or three minutes, the statistician weighed the weight of a truckload of wheat. Then the truck drove onto the drying ground to unload the grain. The truck driver and his assistant opened the truck bed, and quickly unloaded a truckload of grain. With this type of automatic unloading truck, the driver only needed to move the control lever in the cab, and the truck bed would tilt up, and the grain would flow down at once. The workers on the drying ground mainly did auxiliary work for the mechanical winnowing. The electric winnowing machine blew the wheat up to ten meters away, and the workers only needed to pile the grain next to the machine and remove the debris that fell from the winnowing. In three minutes or less, the machine winnowed a ton of wheat. The cleaning machine could select ten to fifteen tons of seeds in ten hours. The purity of the selected seeds reached over 99.5%. On the drying grounds of each branch farm, newly arrived grain dryers are being installed these days. Each dryer can reduce the moisture content of two tons of grain by 2% to 4% per hour.

During the intense wheat harvest, Friendship Farm gathered a large number of trucks. The trucks donated by the Soviet people, newly purchased by the farm this year, and trucks from various places supporting the farm's wheat harvest, have totaled about two hundred. On the road in front of the main farm leading to the first branch farm, a truck passed every five minutes. Trucks transporting the farm's new grain for sale drove all the way to the station. Trucks unloading grain, mobile repair vehicles, and fuel trucks ran between the wheat fields and the drying grounds. Interspersed among these vehicles were jeeps carrying the heads of the main and branch farms to the fields to inspect the work, and busy production team leaders speeding by on motorcycles.

As dusk fell, the electric lights on the drying ground lit up first. A tall red light told the combine harvester drivers still working in the fields that it was time to stop work. The night shift workers entered the drying ground, and the drivers on the next shift hooked up the five-furrow plows and drove the tractors to the fields where the stubble and straw had been burned. As midnight approached, the day shift workers went to sleep. The sound of the machines on the drying ground and the sound of the tractors plowing the fields reverberated across the fields all night long.

    友谊农场麦收全盘机械化
    运送出售新麦的汽车五分钟开出一辆
    新华社佳木斯18日电　新华社记者马新仁报道：国营友谊农场的麦收已经进入了高潮。运转在麦收工作各个环节中的机器，把农场形成了一座农业工厂。
    翻地翻了一夜的拖拉机手摘掉五铧犁将机车由田间开回作业站的时候，全场成百台联合收割机上的工作人员正在各生产队里做出车前的准备。联合收割机的汽笛叫了，红色的自动式的、灰色的“C—六”牵引式的联合收割机，一台一台地进入麦田。远远望去，雄伟的联合收割机像浮在金色海洋上迅速航行的舰艇。在“C—六”联合收割机的操纵台上可以领略收割机器的惊人效能。成熟了的麦子在木翻轮下弯下腰来，四点九公尺宽的理发推子似的割刀飞快地切断了麦秆。倒在收割台上的小麦，转眼之间被输送带送进机器的肚子里。等你略一迟疑转过脸来看左边的时候，打净了的麦子已经顺着升运器吐进了粮箱。筛出来的杂草籽顺着导管落进一只袋子里。麦秸和麦壳从收割机的尾部抛撒出去。最多不过五十分钟，容纳两吨上下粮食的粮箱装满了，联合收割机驾驶员的助手摇摇旗子。汽车开来了。装满了粮食以后，汽车开进晒麦场。
    在晒麦场上，流动发电站嗡嗡地响着。过秤是这里的第一道工作。汽车开到了地中衡的铁板上，磅秤的杠杆跳起来了。两、三分钟的功夫，统计员就称出了一汽车的麦子的重量。而后汽车开到晒麦场上卸粮。汽车司机和他的助手打开车厢板，很快地就把一车粮食卸净。这种自动卸货卡车，司机只要在驾驶舱里动一下操纵器，车厢就翘了起来，粮食一下就流了下来。晒麦场上的工人，主要只做机器扬场的辅助工作。电动扬谷机把麦子一直扬到十公尺以外的地方，工人只要向机器旁边堆粮食，清除扬场落下来的夹杂物。在三分钟或者更少的时间内，机器就扬完了一吨麦子。清选机十小时可以选种十吨到十五吨。选出来的种子纯净度达到99.5％以上。各个分场的晒麦场上，这几天正在加紧安装新运到的谷物干燥机。一台干燥机每小时可以把两吨粮食的水分降低2％到4％。
    在紧张的麦收中，友谊农场聚集了大量的汽车。苏联人民赠送的、农场今年新购买的和各地支援农场麦收的汽车，总数已经达到二百辆左右。在总场部前面通向一分场的公路上，每五分钟就有一辆汽车开过。运送农场出售新粮的汽车，一直开往车站。卸粮的卡车、流动修理车、加油车在麦田和晒麦场之间奔跑。夹杂在这些车辆之间的是，总场和分场负责人到田间检查工作乘坐的吉普车，忙碌的生产队长骑着摩托车风驰而过。
    当黄昏降临以后，晒麦场上的电灯首先亮了。一盏高高的红灯，告诉还在田间工作的联合收割机驾驶员，收车的时间到了。夜班的工人进入了晒麦场，换班的驾驶员挂上五铧犁将拖拉机开往烧完了麦茬和麦秸的田里。午夜临近的时候，日班的工人入睡了。晒麦场上的机器声，和正在翻地的拖拉机的声音，澈夜震荡着田野。
