    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st. The seven specialized companies of the Beijing Municipal Third Commercial Bureau (food, catering, aquatic products, etc.) have made significant improvements in their work over the past month or so after inspecting the implementation of ethnic policies in commerce.

    In the beef and mutton retail stores in various streets, Hui residents can buy fresh beef and mutton every day. After the food company strengthened its dispatch and procurement work based on the opinions of Hui customers, the phenomenon of insufficient supply has disappeared. The number of heads supplied citywide each day in July increased by more than 40% compared to June. A halal beef and mutton processing plant has also been established according to the requirements of the Hui people. In order to respect the lifestyle habits of the Hui people, the catering company has increased the number of halal soy milk processing plants and stipulated that all joint canteens managed by both Hui and Han should be strictly separated. The supply of flour to Hui restaurants has also been increased. The sugar and pastry company has added special counters for halal candies and pastries in its larger stores, and expanded four Chinese-style halal pastry factories.

    There are more than 80,000 Hui people in Beijing. There are also many Hui employees in the food industry, nearly 6,000, of whom all beef and mutton shops are operated by Hui people. When inspecting the implementation of ethnic policies in commercial departments, each company held extensive symposiums and visits to solicit opinions and requests from the Hui people. The Third Commercial Bureau has also specifically formulated measures based on the problems identified, making specific provisions for commodity supply, economic reorganization, personnel arrangements, and the lives of the Hui people.

    尊重回族人民的风俗习惯
    北京改进食品饮食供应工作
    新华社21日讯　北京市第三商业局所属食品、饮食、水产等七个专业公司检查在商业中贯彻执行民族政策后，最近一个多月来工作上已有显著改进。
    在各个街道的牛羊肉零售店里，回族居民每天都能买到新鲜牛羊肉。食品公司根据回民顾客意见，加强调运和采购工作后，供应不足的现象已经没有了，七月份全市每天供应的头数比六月份增加了40％以上。一个清真牛羊肉加工厂也按着回民要求设立起来了。为了尊重回民的生活习惯，饮食业公司增加了清真豆浆加工厂，并规定所有回汉统一管理的联合食堂要严格分开。对回民饭馆的面粉供应量也有增加。糖业糕点公司在所属的较大商店里，增设了清真糖果糕点专柜，并扩建了四个中式清真糕点厂。
    北京市有八万多回民。在食品行业中的回民从业人员也很多，有近六千人，其中牛羊肉商店全部由回民经营。在检查商业部门中执行民族政策的情况时，各公司广泛举行了座谈会和访问，征求回民的意见和要求。第三商业局并根据检查出来的问题，专门制定了办法，对商品供应、经济改组、人事安排和回民生活等问题作了具体规定。
