Hubei Province and Wuhan City Teachers Hold Summer Get-Together

    (Our report) Wuhan - More than 2,000 teachers from Wuhan spent a joyous evening at the Cultural Club on July 30th. This was the first summer teachers' get-together jointly organized by the Education Bureaus of Hubei Province and Wuhan City. Some teachers chatted and played chess in the tea gardens among the flower beds and trees, while others guessed riddles or played "fishing" and "liberating Taiwan" games under the grapevines and in the main corridors. Still others listened to comic dialogues and Hubei drum performances in the backyard. More people gathered in the huge open-air dance floor to dance. The teachers also watched several short song and dance performances and small fireworks displays, and returned home happily at 11:30 PM.

    湖北省、武汉市教师举行暑期联欢
    本报讯　武汉市二千多名教师七月三十日在文化俱乐部度过了一个欢乐的夜晚。这是湖北省和武汉市教育局联合举办的第一次暑期教师联欢晚会。教师们有的在花坛树林间的茶园里谈心、下棋，有的在葡萄架下和正廊中猜谜或作“钓鱼”和“解放台湾”游戏，有的在后院里听相声、湖北大鼓等曲艺，更多的人则聚在巨大的露天舞池中跳舞。教师们还观赏了几个短小的歌舞节目和小型焰火，至十一时半始尽兴而归。
