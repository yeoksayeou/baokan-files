Xinhua News Agency, Nagasaki, 12th. The Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs successfully concluded yesterday at the Higashi High School Gymnasium in Nagasaki. The conference appealed to the people of the world to jointly strive to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The conference, held in Nagasaki for three days, passed several resolutions. These resolutions included: demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests; demanding that all countries in the world hold a world conference to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and reduce armaments; having the International Court of Justice in The Hague determine that the use of atomic weapons is illegal; concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy; establishing an international research institution for the treatment of radiation sickness; opposing the United States' expansion of military bases on Okinawa; and opposing Japan's rearmament.

Representatives of atomic bomb victims, such as Hiramoto Kazuto and Egashira Chiyoko, addressed the conference, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the representatives of various countries for providing them with assistance. At this time, Xu Guangping, head of the Chinese delegation, approached the representatives of the victims, personally put peace memorial badges on them, and embraced them, encouraging them. The victims were moved to tears. Thunderous applause rang out in the venue for a long time.

The conference finally adopted the "Declaration of the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs." The declaration stated that, due to the persistent efforts and continuous pressure from the people of the world, the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and reducing armaments has now become a serious topic of discussion for governments and parliaments around the world. However, the United Nations Disarmament Commission has not yet made any decisions on the issue of disarmament and banning nuclear weapons. Therefore, atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, which seriously threaten all mankind, are still continuing. We appeal to the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, to strive for the immediate banning of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests.

The declaration pointed out that atomic energy can only be applied to the happiness of mankind after the banning of atomic and hydrogen bombs is realized. To achieve this goal, cooperation between scientists and the general public is currently necessary and urgent. To further advance the rapidly progressing movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, we should strengthen unity and joint activities with all groups willing to build a peaceful society for the future of mankind.

The declaration said that the atomic and hydrogen bomb victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the world's first atomic bomb victims. For the activities to rescue these victims to succeed, it is necessary to launch domestic and foreign relief movements and realize the banning of atomic and hydrogen bombs and the withdrawal of foreign military bases in Japan. This is also the common wish of the people of the world. All peace movements are rapidly developing towards this goal.

The five thousand Japanese representatives and representatives from six international organizations and seven countries participating in the conference vowed in the conference declaration: to cooperate and struggle with the people of all countries in the world to thoroughly achieve the goal of banning nuclear weapons.

At the close of the conference, all participants sang "Don't Allow Atomic Bombs to be Used Again."

    第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会发表宣言
    呼吁为禁止原子弹和氢弹而奋斗
    新华社12日讯　长崎消息：第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会昨天在长崎市东高中体育馆胜利闭幕。大会向全世界人民呼吁为禁止使用原子弹和氢弹而共同奋斗。
    大会在长崎举行三天后，通过了几项决议。这些决议包括：要求美、英、苏三国缔结禁止原子弹、氢弹试验协定；要求世界各国举行禁止原子弹、氢弹和裁减军备世界大会；由海牙国际法庭确定使用原子武器是非法的；关于原子能的和平利用；设立治疗放射线病的国际研究机关；反对美国扩大冲绳岛的军事基地；反对日本重新武装等。
    原子弹受害者代表平元一登、江头千代子等在大会上致词，向世界各国代表给予他们援助这件事表示衷心感谢。这时，中国代表团团长许广平走近受害者代表身旁，亲自把和平纪念章给他们带上，并且拥抱他们，勉励他们。受害者们感激得眼泪不停地流出来。会场中响起了雷动般的掌声，经久不息。
    大会最后通过了“第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会宣言”。宣言说，由于世界各国人民坚忍不拔的努力和不断地施加压力，现在禁止原子弹、氢弹问题和裁减军备问题已经成为世界各国政府和国会认真讨论的问题。但是，至今联合国裁军委员会对裁减军备和禁止核子武器问题还没有做出任何决定。因此，严重地威胁全人类的原子弹、氢弹试验仍然在继续进行中。我们向全世界人民、尤其是向亚洲人民呼吁，为了立刻禁止原子弹和氢弹试验而努力。
    宣言指出，在实现禁止原子弹、氢弹以后，原子能才能应用到人类的幸福上。为了实现这个目的，科学家和一般群众的合作是当前的必要和急要的事。要使正在飞跃前进的禁止原子弹、氢弹运动更向前进，我们应该与愿意建设未来人类的和平社会的一切团体更加强团结和共同活动。
    宣言说，广岛和长崎的原子弹、氢弹受害者是世界上的头一个原子弹牺牲者。要使救济这些受害者的活动成功，必须展开国内和国外的救援运动，并且实现禁止原子弹、氢弹和撤销在日本的外国军事基地。这也是全世界人民的共同愿望。所有的和平运动，正在朝着这个目标迅速地发展。
    参加大会的五千名日本代表和六个国际组织，七个国家的代表在大会宣言中宣誓说：为了彻底实现禁止核子武器的目的，要同全世界各国人民合作和奋斗。
    大会闭幕时，全体与会者合唱“不许再使用原子弹”歌。
