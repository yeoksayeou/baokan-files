    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th August. To strengthen ideological education for party members and strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural cooperatives, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is focusing on running rural evening party schools in various regions.
    The evening party schools run in various parts of Shanxi Province generally hold concentrated classes once every half month to a month, and then use spare time from work to conduct group discussions. In addition to basic Party knowledge and policies, the content of the Party classes also includes explanations based on the current work and the actual ideological situation of Party members. Therefore, the content of the lectures is relatively substantial and easy to understand. Party organizations at all levels throughout the province attach great importance to the newly established evening party schools. Some Party branches have established teaching committees or teaching and research groups, with the branch secretary giving lectures and equipped with fixed full-time branch instructors. The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has printed branch teaching materials. The County Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in various counties also use Party reporters to regularly impart lecture materials to the evening party schools.
    The work of Party propaganda and education in the rural areas of Shanxi Province was originally relatively active. However, at a time when the realization of agricultural cooperation in the entire province required strengthening the Party's leadership over the cooperatives, some people mistakenly believed that "Party members are all participating in the cooperatives, and problems are easy to solve," "The labor enthusiasm of the members is very high, and there are no problems that need the Party to manage," and so on. Therefore, the Party's propaganda and education work in rural areas was once weakened.
    In response to this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the method of trial-running evening party schools and conducted experiments in Huguan, Pingshun, Jincheng and other counties. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department convened cadres from propaganda departments of various regional committees to specifically inspect the trial operation, which proved that the effect of this method of Party education was good. After the Guo Fort Branch of Huguan County established a advanced agricultural production cooperative this spring, it relaxed its political and ideological leadership over the agricultural cooperative. In May, with the help of the Huguan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the branch opened an evening party school and first concentrated on explaining and discussing the existing problems and solutions within the current agricultural cooperative. Through analyzing many specific facts, the party members realized that there were many problems existing within the agricultural cooperative now, such as the contradictions between the cooperative and the members, between the members and the cadres of the cooperative, and between the middle peasant members and the poor peasant members, some of which had already affected the development of production and the unity within the cooperative. Party members who originally believed that there were no problems to manage in the agricultural cooperative now felt that they really could not keep up with the needs of the work if they did not study and improve themselves. Finally, the Party branch stipulated the methods for strengthening the Party's ideological leadership over the cooperative based on everyone's opinions. Xu Zhangshun, a Party member and cadre in Changxing Village, Huguan County, had not complied with the regulations of the agricultural cooperative for three years, cultivating more good private plots, which aroused dissatisfaction among the members. However, when the Changxing Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party dealt with this problem, it only made passive criticisms and accusations, without explaining the reasons, and Xu Zhangshun did not accept it, and the matter was not resolved for three years. Recently, after this branch established an evening party school, it talked about the eight conditions of the Party member standard, and also organized extracurricular discussions to help Xu Zhangshun understand the nature and harm of the Party member's selfish and self-interested mistakes. Xu Zhangshun woke up at this time and immediately expressed his intention to return the private plots he had cultivated.

### 中共山西省委重点举办农村夜间党校加强对党员的思想教育

    中共山西省委重点举办农村夜间党校
    加强对党员的思想教育
    新华社太原4日电　中共山西省委员会为了加强对党员的思想教育，加强党对农业合作社的领导，正在各地有重点地举办农村夜间党校。
    山西省各地举办的夜间党校，一般每半月到一月集中上课一次，然后利用工余时间分组讨论。党课内容除党的基本知识和政策外，还结合当前工作和党员的思想实际情况进行讲解。因此讲课内容比较充实而且通俗易懂。全省各级党组织对新办的夜党校都很重视。有些党支部成立了教学委员会或教研组，支部书记担任讲课，并且配备了固定的支部专职教员。中共山西省委宣传部印发了支部教材。各县中共县委还利用党的报告员，经常向夜党校传授讲课材料。
    山西省农村党内宣传教育工作原来是比较活跃的。但是在全省农村实现农业合作化，正需要加强党对合作社的领导的时候，有些人却错误地认为“党员都参加合作社了，有问题好解决”、“社员劳动情绪很高，没有什么问题需要党来管理”等等。因此，农村党的宣传教育工作曾经一度削弱。
    中共山西省委针对这种情况，采取了试办夜间党校的办法，并在壶关、平顺、晋城等县进行了试验。最近省委宣传部召集各地委宣传部干部专门检查了试办情况，证明这种党内教育方法的效果是良好的。中共壶关县郭堡支部，在今年春季建立高级农业生产合作社后，放松了对农业社的政治思想领导。五月，这个支部在中共壶关县委员会的帮助下，开办了一座夜间党校，首先集中讲解并讨论了当前农业社内存在的问题和解决办法。党员们通过对许多具体事实的分析，认识了现在农业社内部存在着社和社员、社员和社干部、中农社员和贫农社员之间的矛盾等许多问题，其中有些问题已经影响到发展生产和社内团结。原来认为农业社没有问题可管的党员，这时感到不学习提高自己，确实赶不上工作需要了。最后党支部根据大家意见规定了加强党对社的思想领导的办法。壶关县常行村党员干部徐张顺三年来不遵守农业社规定，多种较好的自留地，引起社员不满。但中共常行村支部在处理这个问题时，只是消极批评和指责，没有说明道理，徐张顺不接受，事隔三年未解决。最近这个支部建立夜党校后讲了党员标准的八项条件，同时还组织课外讨论，帮助徐张顺认识了党员自私自利错误的性质和危害性，徐张顺这时觉悟过来，当下表示退回个人多种的自留地。
