    Between Looking Up and Looking Down
    ——Excerpts from Director ×’s Diary
    Yuchi Kui
    × Month 2nd
    Evening, listened to the report. ××× of ×× Section is again complaining about the roof of the dormitory, putting personal interests above everything else. To be criticized at next week's general meeting.

    × Month 3rd
    Morning, bureau affairs meeting, Deputy Director × raised his proposal for the fifth time, not understanding the actual situation, shouting empty slogans about expanding democracy, annoyingly entangled, terribly impetuous, suspiciously motivated. Will have an individual talk tomorrow and see what happens.

    × Month 5th
    Inspected the work of ×× Section. Cadres have serious discontent, failing to view issues from a developmental perspective, only knowing to shout about "overstaffing." Instructed Section Chief × to resolve their thinking.

    × Month 9th
    The ×× Monthly published an article on the ×× issue, reportedly written by ××× of the Secretary's Office under a pseudonym. A typical example of seeking fame and gain. Notified the Secretary's Office to conduct education.

    × Month 12th
    Listened to Director ×'s report on letters from the masses. These people are insatiable, forgetting what kind of lives they lived before liberation, disregarding the country's difficulties, and all clamoring as if they had agreed beforehand about "poor product quality." Ignoring them!

    × Month 15th
    For half a month, focusing on ideological leadership, more and more problems are being discovered, which can probably be considered in-depth. Evening, writing an outline for a report on opposing individualism. This is the key to all problems, and it is worth spending some effort to prepare.

    × Month 16th
    The ministry affairs meeting was brought forward to today, and the report had to be rescheduled. The minister instructed: Improving product quality is the current central task. An brilliant instruction! Truly understands the demands of the masses! Evening, convened an emergency bureau affairs meeting to convey the minister's instructions, ordered an inspection of substandard products, and established an improvement plan.

    × Month 18th
    The Ministry Party Committee notified: Oppose ignoring employee welfare, invigorate democratic life in the agency, and properly arrange cadre work. This afternoon, a meeting was held to order the personnel section to investigate the phenomenon of overstaffing, and to order the general affairs section to submit a written self-criticism regarding the long-term lack of repair of the leaking dormitory roof. Work squad leader ×××'s act of suppressing criticism can be used as a typical example, and will be criticized by name at the general meeting, to promote democracy through this call.

    × Month 25th
    ×× came to talk, he heard from ×× that Deputy Minister × mentioned the article in ×× Monthly to Director × at the banquet the night before, and seemed to have a good impression. This is the new force in our bureau. Notified the personnel section to vigorously cultivate him.

    俯仰之间
    ——×局长日记钞
    尉迟葵
    ×月二日
    晚，听汇报。××科×××又为宿舍屋顶问题大发牢骚，个人利益至上。下周大会上批评。
    ×月三日
    上午局务会议，×副处长第五次提出他那方案，不明实际情形，空喊扩大民主，纠缠可厌，浮躁可恶，用意可疑。明日个别谈话后再看。
    ×月五日
    检查××科工作，干部不满情绪严重，不从发展观点看问题，只晓得喊什么“人浮于事”。责成×科长打通思想。
    ×月九日
    ××月刊发表关于××问题的一篇论文，据报，就是秘书室×××用笔名写的。名利思想的典型。通知秘书室进行教育。
    ×月十二日
    听×主任关于群众来信的汇报，这些人贪心不足，忘了解放前过的什么日子，不知体念国家困难，商量好了似地都来大叫什么“产品质量低劣”。不理他！
    ×月十五日
    半月来抓紧思想领导，问题越抓越多，大约还可以算得深入。晚，写关于反对个人主义问题报告提纲。这是一切问题的关键所在，花些力气来准备是值得的。
    ×月十六日
    部务会议提前今日举行，报告只好改期。部长指示：提高产品质量是当前中心工作。英明的指示！真正了解群众要求！晚，召开紧急局务会议传达部长指示，责成检查劣品，定出改进计划。
    ×月十八日
    部党委通知：反对漠视职工福利，活跃机关民主生活，妥善安排干部工作。下午开会，责成人事科检查人浮于事的现象，责令总务科就宿舍屋顶漏雨长期不修的问题提出书面检讨。工务班长×××有压制批评行为，可作典型事例，大会指名批评，通过这个号召发扬民主。
    ×月二十五日
    ××来谈，他听××说，×副部长前晚宴会上向×司长提到××月刊那篇论文，似乎印象不坏。这是我局的新生力量。通知人事科，大力培养。
