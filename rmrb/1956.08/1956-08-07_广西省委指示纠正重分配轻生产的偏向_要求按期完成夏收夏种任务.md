Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 4th: Currently, some rural leading cadres in Guangxi Province have the idea of "emphasizing distribution and neglecting production," resulting in slow progress in the summer harvest and planting, and the late rice transplanting may be delayed. To this end, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to correct the deviation from reality in the summer distribution, and demanded that the summer planting tasks be completed on schedule.

This year, the summer crops of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Guangxi Province have generally had bumper harvests, but because of the reduction in sideline income, some agricultural cooperatives still cannot achieve a 90% increase in income for their members. Some agricultural cooperatives, in order to achieve this target, adopted improper methods such as estimating high grain yields, selling pigs and fish that have not yet grown up in advance, including agricultural and sideline income that will only be available in the next month or two in this distribution, pre-paying excessive workdays, and not reserving sufficient public grain, seeds, and necessary production expenses, to formulate summer distribution plans. The rural leadership in many areas has concentrated its efforts on summer distribution work, and has not adequately recognized the urgency of summer production. According to the production season here, late rice transplanting should be completed before the beginning of autumn (August 7). However, according to incomplete statistics on July 26, more than 4.7 million mu of early rice had been harvested throughout the province, accounting for less than one-third of the total area of early rice; while late rice transplanting only accounted for slightly more than one-fifth of the early rice harvested area.

The main part of the rural production income in Guangxi Province is in the second half of the year. The Guangxi Provincial Party Committee pointed out in its instructions: If this situation is not changed quickly, it will affect the completion of the production tasks in the second half of the year and guarantee that 90% of the members' incomes will increase throughout the year. It is necessary to immediately take measures, concentrate all available forces, and complete the late rice transplanting task according to the production season. The instructions pointed out that the key to doing this work well lies in overcoming the complacency and slackening thoughts of some cadres after the bumper harvest of summer crops, strengthening specific leadership over rural work, proceeding from reality, and doing a good job in summer distribution using simple and easy methods; rationally allocating manpower and animal power, giving full play to the enthusiasm of members for labor, improving labor efficiency, and striving to do a good job in production in the second half of the year, so that income-increasing households can obtain greater income increases, and income-reducing households can be compensated in the production in the second half of the year, and strive to obtain income increases.

    广西省委指示纠正重分配轻生产的偏向
    要求按期完成夏收夏种任务
    新华社南宁4日电　目前，广西省有些农村领导干部存在着“重分配，轻生产”的思想，以致夏收夏种进展缓慢，晚稻插秧可能要延误季节。为此，中共广西省委会在最近发出指示，纠正夏季分配中不从实际出发的偏向，要求按期突击完成夏种任务。
    广西省各地农业生产合作社今年夏收作物普遍丰收，但由于副业收入减少，仍有一部分农业社不能达到90％的社员增加收入。有些农业社为了硬要达到这个指标，采用估高粮食产量，提前出卖还没有长成的猪、鱼，把今后一两个月才能到手的农作物及副业收入计入这次分配，预支过多的劳动日，不留足公粮、种子和必需的生产费用等不正当的办法，来制定夏季分配方案。不少地区的农村领导干部力量集中在夏季分配工作上，对夏季生产的紧迫意义认识不足。按照这里的生产季节，立秋节（八月七日）前应完成晚稻插秧。但据七月二十六日不完全统计，全省已收割早稻四百七十多万亩，占早稻总面积的三分之一弱；而晚稻插秧只占早稻收割面积的五分之一强。
    广西省农村生产收入的主要部分在下半年。中共广西省委指示指出：这种现象如不迅速改变，将要影响下半年生产任务的完成和保证90％的社员全年增加收入。必须立即采取措施，集中一切可以利用的力量，按照生产季节，完成晚稻插秧任务。指示指出，要做好这一工作，关键在于克服某些干部在夏收作物丰收后产生的自满松劲思想，加强对农村工作的具体领导，从实际出发，用简单易行的办法搞好夏季分配；合理地调配人力，畜力，发挥社员的劳动积极性，提高劳动效率，努力搞好下半年生产，使增收户获得更大的增收，减收户在下半年生产中得到补救，并争取获得增收。
