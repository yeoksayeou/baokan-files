Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 5th – The definitive survey work for the middle section (from Yibin in Sichuan Province to Dawanzi in Daguan County, Yunnan Province) and the preliminary survey work for the main line of the southern section (from Dawanzi to Zhanyi) of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway have been completed in mid-July and late July respectively. Currently, design personnel are conducting construction design for the middle section based on the definitive survey data.
	The Neijiang-Kunming Railway traverses the hilly areas of southern Sichuan, the high-altitude cold mountainous regions of western Guizhou, and the northeastern Yunnan plateau, with a considerable portion situated among mountains over 2,000 meters above sea level. Survey team members overcame numerous difficulties during the survey process. The cliffs of Dousha Pass and Goupa Rock, which the railway will pass through in the future, resemble steep cliffs cleaved by giant axes. When surveying here, the team members first secured ropes to tree roots, suspended themselves in mid-air, and chiseled out horseshoe-sized steps on the steep cliffs. Then, carrying instruments and tools, they climbed from these steps to the top of the cliffs to conduct surveying. In the Yuntai Mountain area along the Heng River, survey team members strung up ziplines across the river, one by one, and completed the surveying tasks.
	The Neijiang-Kunming Railway is more than 880 kilometers long. Except for the section from Zhanyi to Kunming, which will be reconstructed based on the original line, the section from Neijiang to Zhanyi is 727 kilometers long and needs to be completely newly built.
	
Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th – Tibet will survey the highway routes from Qamdo to Zayu, Qamdo to Dingqing, Dingqing to Heihe, Lhasa to Shannan, and Xigaze to Dingri this year. Among them, the Lhasa-Shannan and Heihe-Ali highways will commence construction within this year. This was stipulated in the provisional work tasks and the third-quarter work plan of the Financial and Economic Committee, which were approved and adopted by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region the day before yesterday.
	The plan also requires industrial and commercial departments to investigate and understand the resources of the entire region based on the economic construction and the needs of the people in Tibet, and gradually formulate plans for the development of industrial construction in the entire region. The agricultural and forestry part of the plan stipulates that the Agricultural and Forestry Department should propose a plan to expand the existing agricultural experiment stations in the third quarter, actively investigate large areas of wasteland suitable for mechanized farming, prepare for the development of mechanized farming farms, train various agricultural technicians, and open tractor driver training classes.
	The plan also stipulates that the Construction Department should immediately begin studying the urban planning work of the entire region, first rectify the appearance of Lhasa city, and prepare for and gradually solve the construction of housing for the poor.

    内昆铁路中段和南段分别完成定测初测
    拉萨到山南和黑河到阿里两条公路年内动工
    新华社昆明5日电　内（江）昆（明）铁路中段（由四川省宜宾到云南省大关县境内的大湾子）的定测工作和南段（由大湾子到沾益）正线的初测工作，已经分别在七月中、下旬先后完成。现在，设计人员正根据定测资料进行中段的施工设计。
    内昆铁路纵贯川南丘陵、贵州西部的高寒山区和滇东北高原，其中很长一段在海拔二千公尺以上的群山之间。勘测队员们在勘测过程中，曾经克服了许多困难。将来铁路要经过的豆沙关、狗怕岩的峭壁像是用巨斧劈成的陡崖。勘测队员们在这里勘测的时候，是在树根上先拴好揪手的绳子，把人悬在半空中在陡岩上凿出一个个马蹄般大的梯蹬，然后背起仪器和工具，从这样的梯蹬上攀登到岩顶进行测绘的。在横江边的云台山地带，勘测队员在江上拴起溜索，一个个地溜渡过江，完成了测绘任务。
    内昆铁路全长八百八十多公里，其中除由沾益到昆明是根据原有线路加以改建外，由内江到沾益段长七百二十七公里，需要全部新建。
    新华社拉萨5日电　西藏在今年内将要勘测昌都到察隅、昌都到丁青、丁青到黑河、拉萨到山南、日喀则到定日等公路线路，其中拉萨到山南和黑河到阿里两条公路，将在今年内开工修筑。这是西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员会前天通过和批准的财经委员会暂行工作任务和第三季度工作计划中规定的。
    这个计划还要求工商主管部门根据西藏地区的经济建设和人民的需要，调查了解全区资源，逐步作出发展全区工业建设的计划。计划中的农林部分规定，农林处第三季度要提出现有农业试验场的扩建计划，并积极调查宜于机耕的大面积荒地，筹备开发机耕农场，培养各种农业技术人员，并开办拖拉机手训练班。
    这个计划还规定建设处应立即着手研究全区城市规划工作，首先整顿拉萨市市容，并筹备及逐步解决贫民住房的建设。
