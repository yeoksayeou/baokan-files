    The Spanish delegation circulated a document among the representatives attending the conference explaining Spain's position. The document stated that Spain had supported the American plan and had requested that if Egypt rejected the American plan, the suggestions originally put forward by Spain should be tried as a basis for negotiations. But now "nothing has been accepted. The only thing that has emerged is the agreement of seventeen countries."
