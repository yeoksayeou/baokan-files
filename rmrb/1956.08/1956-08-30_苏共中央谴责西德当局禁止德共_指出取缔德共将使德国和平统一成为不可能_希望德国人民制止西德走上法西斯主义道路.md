Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has issued a statement regarding the ban on the German Communist Party by West German authorities.

The statement points out that the West German authorities' declaration of the German Communist Party as illegal is an event of great political importance opposing the cause of peace and democracy, and is an anti-people action that tramples on the basic rights and freedoms of the German people. Its purpose is to suppress peaceful forces and strengthen the aggressive German militarism that endangers the security of the people of European countries.

This matter is a link in the overall chain of measures by the West German ruling clique to turn West Germany into a militarist state, a dangerous base for new wars and reactionary forces in Europe. This matter will lead to the intensification of international tensions.

The statement emphasizes that the trend of this action by the West German authorities is the same as the trend of various related events on the eve of the establishment of the former German fascist regime. Now the West German ruling clique is embarking on the path taken by the German Nazis. However, the German militarists and revanchists who are retracing Hitler's old path should know that history will not repeat itself. The people of all countries have learned much from the painful experience of the Second World War.

The CPSU Central Committee emphasized that the West German authorities' terrorist actions brutally violate the unanimous decision of the anti-Hitler allied countries during the Second World War, which stipulated that the democratization of Germany was the most important condition for the post-war organization of the German state.

It must be emphasized very solemnly that banning the Communist Party, which fights most thoroughly for the restoration of German unity, will also make the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis impossible. Under conditions of suppressing freedom of speech and suppressing the freedom of activity of democratic parties and groups, there can be no question of the German people freely expressing their will on the issue of how to unite Germany. Under these conditions, it is meaningless to talk about "free" all-German elections. The policy insisted upon by the West German ruling clique is not to unite Germany by peaceful means, but to forcibly unite Germany through a new war.

It is not difficult to see that banning the Communist Party is only the first step in taking arbitrary actions against other parties and groups that are not liked by the current West German rulers for various reasons. All those who cherish peace, democracy and international cooperation, and all those who do not want the revival of German fascism, must resolutely resist the German reactionary forces' offensive against the progressive representatives of the German people who are fighting for peace, democracy and freedom.

The CPSU Central Committee's statement gives fraternal support to the heroic struggle of the German Communist Party and is deeply convinced that the German people will never embark on the road that the reactionaries and war forces are trying to push them onto.

The statement said, we hope that the German people will embark on the only correct path—the path of peace and international cooperation that guarantees the real progress and prosperity of the German people. We hope that the German working class will no longer repeat the fatal mistakes it made in the past when the reactionary forces partially defeated the German workers' movement. The German working class will be able to unite all honest and progressive forces of the German people around itself and prevent West Germany from embarking on the road of fascism and military adventures.

In their selfless struggle for the peaceful and democratic development of Germany, German Communists will always receive the warm sympathy and support of the Soviet people and all progressive forces in the world.

    苏共中央谴责西德当局禁止德共
    指出取缔德共将使德国和平统一成为不可能
    希望德国人民制止西德走上法西斯主义道路
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会就德国共产党遭到禁止一事发表声明。
    声明指出，西德当局宣布德国共产党非法，这是一件具有巨大政治重要性的反对和平民主事业的事件，是一种蹂躏德国人民的基本权利和自由的反人民的行动，其目的在于镇压和平力量，加强危害欧洲各国人民安全的侵略性德国军国主义。
    这件事是西德统治集团要把西德变为军国主义国家、变为新战争和欧洲反动力量危险的大本营的各项措施的总链条中的一环。这件事将会导致国际紧张局势的加剧。
    声明强调说，西德当局的这种行动的趋向是同过去德国法西斯制度建立前夕的各种有关事件的趋向相同的。现在西德统治集团正在走上德国纳粹主义者走过的道路。但是，重走希特勒老路的德国军国主义者和复仇主义者应该知道，历史是不会重演的。各国人民在第二次世界大战的痛苦经验中已经学到了许多东西。
    苏共中央着重指出，西德当局的恐怖行动粗暴地破坏了第二次世界大战期间反希特勒同盟各国的一致决定，这项决定规定德国民主化是战后组织德国国家的一项最重要的条件。
    必须十分郑重地强调指出，取缔最彻底地为恢复德国统一而斗争的共产党，还将使得在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一成为不可能。在压制言论自由、压制民主党派和团体的活动自由的情况下，根本谈不上德国人民在如何统一德国的问题上自由表达意志。在这种条件下谈论什么“自由的”全德选举，那就毫无意义了。西德统治集团坚持的方针不是用和平方式来统一德国，而是通过新战争来强行统一德国。
    不难看出，禁止共产党只是对其他因种种缘故而不为目前西德统治者所喜欢的那些政党和团体采取专横行动的第一步。一切珍视和平、民主和国际合作的人，一切不愿德国法西斯主义复活的人，都必须坚决反抗德国反动势力对德国人民中为和平和民主自由斗争的进步代表展开的进攻。
    苏共中央声明对德国共产党进行的英勇斗争给予兄弟的支持，并且深信德国人民决不会走上反动派和战争势力企图把他们推上去的那条道路。
    声明说，我们希望，德国人民将走上唯一正确的道路——保证德国人民真正进步和繁荣的和平和国际合作的道路。我们希望德国工人阶级能够不再重犯过去在反动派部分击破德国工人运动的时候所犯的致命错误。德国工人阶级将能够把德国人民一切正直的、进步的力量团结在自己的周围，制止西德走上法西斯主义和军事冒险的道路。
    德国共产党人在为德国的和平民主发展而进行的奋不顾身的斗争中，将始终得到苏联人民和全世界所有进步力量的热烈同情和支持。
