Masses' Voice

    Address Plates Are Too Expensive
    Recently, the Tu Li He Public Security Bureau replaced the address plates for every household in Tu Li He City. A wooden address plate, 12 cm long, 9 cm wide, and 1 cm thick, actually costs 15 cents. The money was collected immediately when the address plates were distributed, and the staff's attitude was also very bad. Originally, replacing the address plates was supposed to be convenient for the masses and should have been welcomed by them, but it resulted in dissatisfaction among the residents. Gao Yuhua

    门牌太贵了
    图里河公安分局，最近给图里河市沿门挨户换新门牌。一块长十二公分、宽九公分、厚一公分的木制门牌，竟收费一角五分。门牌发下，立即收款，工作人员态度还很不好。本来换新门牌，给群众以方便，是应当受到群众欢迎的，结果，却引起了居民的不满。　高玉华
