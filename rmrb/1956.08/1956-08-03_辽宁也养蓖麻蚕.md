Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. After experimentation, it has been proven that Liaoning Province is also suitable for raising castor silkworms. The Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to develop this on a large scale in the future.

In mid-June, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture transported a batch of castor silkworm seeds from Shanghai, distributing them to the Liaoning Provincial Tussah Silkworm Experiment Station, Erdaoyangcha Township in Huanren County, and Panjia Township in Fengcheng County for trial rearing, with good results. The "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Erdaoyangcha Township, which experimented with rearing a box of castor silkworm seeds, saw the silkworms emerge on June 20th and completely spin their cocoons by July 7th. They harvested more than 7,000 cocoons, estimated to produce 60 boxes of seeds and also 5 jin of silk floss.

The first generation of more than 120 boxes of castor silkworm seeds that have already been produced will soon be transported to Tieling, Xinbin, Fengcheng, Huanren, Xifeng, Xiuyan and other places to begin the second generation of rearing.

    辽宁也养蓖麻蚕
    新华社沈阳1日电　经过试验以后，证明辽宁省也适宜饲养蓖麻蚕。辽宁省农业厅已经决定今后大量发展。
    六月中旬，辽宁省农业厅从上海运来一批蓖麻蚕种，分在辽宁省柞蚕试验站、桓仁县二道阳岔乡和凤城县潘家乡试养，效果良好。二道阳岔乡“五四”农业生产合作社试养的一盒蓖麻蚕种，从六月二十日出蚕，到七月七日就全部做完茧，共摘茧七千多粒，估计能制种六十盒，还能制丝棉五斤。
    现在已经制出的一百二十多盒第一代蓖麻蚕种，不久就将运到铁岭、新宾、凤城、桓仁、西丰、岫岩等地，开始第二代饲养。
