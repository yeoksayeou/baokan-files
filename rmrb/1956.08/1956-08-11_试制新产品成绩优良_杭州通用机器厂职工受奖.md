    Hangzhou General Machinery Factory Employees Rewarded for Excellent New Product Trial Production
    According to Xinhua News Agency, in 1955, the Hangzhou General Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced a total of twenty-three new products. Among them were drill bits and drill pipe joints for oil drilling, two types of gas cutting machines capable of cutting 100 mm thick steel plates, an ammonia compressor with a cooling capacity of 200,000 kilocalories per hour, and non-standard equipment manufactured for the First Automobile Works, including grease pumps, air filters, centrifuges, and electric centrifuges. In January of this year, the factory also successfully trial-produced an oxygen production unit with a capacity of 30 cubic meters of oxygen per hour, which can be equipped in oxygen production workshops of shipyards and machinery manufacturing plants for welding and cutting steel plates, and can also be used to equip central oxygen production plants in general cities. The Hangzhou General Machinery Factory received a bonus of 15,000 yuan and an award banner from the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the First Machine Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. Many employees who achieved success in trial-producing new products received bonuses.

    Implementing the Policy of Serving the Local Agricultural Economy, Hunan Province Begins to Formulate a Comprehensive Plan for Developing Local Industry
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th (Reporter Hu Jian): Hunan Province's local industrial departments have begun to pay attention to comprehensively implementing the policy of serving the local agricultural economy. Currently, the double-wheeled, double-furrow plows unsuitable for use in Hunan's paddy fields have ceased production. The local state-owned Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory is concentrating its technical efforts on researching a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow suitable for use in Hunan's paddy fields and trial-producing other small agricultural machinery. Rhizobium fertilizer, which can be used for 200,000 mu of green manure intercropping after the autumn harvest for Hunan farmers, has begun production. The processing industry for various agricultural by-products, which had been neglected in the past, is now receiving attention.
    In June, the Hunan Provincial Department of Industry dispatched three work groups, each led by a director-level cadre, to conduct focused investigations lasting two to three months in hilly areas, mountainous areas, and areas along Dongting Lake to understand the needs of farmers and formulate a comprehensive plan for developing local industry according to the characteristics of the Hunan region.
    In the past, the idea of serving the agricultural economy was not comprehensive enough in Hunan Province's local industry. Local industrial departments had paid attention to the production of agricultural machinery, tools, and pesticides, but neglected the processing industry of agricultural by-products such as sweet potatoes, oilseeds, and hemp fibers, and paid little attention to the development of various daily necessities and other essential industrial products needed by the people. In particular, there was a lack of investigation and research into the agricultural economy of the Hunan region, and it was not possible to earnestly implement the policy of serving the local agricultural economy from the perspective of regional characteristics and people's needs. For example, the province's only agricultural machinery factory mainly produced double-wheeled, double-furrow plows for dry land in northern China in the first half of the year. Only half of the water pumps produced by the local state-owned Changsha Machinery Factory in the first half of the year were supplied to rural areas in the province. Of the more than 60,000 rice threshers supplied to farmers this year, many were poorly manufactured due to rushing time and catching up with tasks, resulting in poor quality and dissatisfaction among many farmers. Recently, the leadership of the Hunan Provincial Department of Industry has conducted an inspection of the local industrial work in the past period, requiring the comprehensive implementation of the policy of serving agriculture, closely combined with the agricultural economy.

    试制新产品成绩优良
    杭州通用机器厂职工受奖
    据新华社讯　杭州通用机器厂1955年一共试制成功了二十三种新产品。其中有石油钻井用的钻头和钻杆接头，可以切割一百毫米厚钢板的两种气割机，产冷量每小时二十万千卡的氨压缩机和为第一汽车制造厂制造的非标准设备黄油泵、空气滤清器、离心机和电动离心机。今年一月，这个厂又试制成功了一种每小时制氧三十立方公尺的制氧设备，可以装备造船厂和机械制造厂的制氧车间，供焊接和切割钢板用，也可以用来装备一般城市的中心制氧厂。杭州通用机器厂得到了第一机械工业部和第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局奖给的一万五千元奖金和一面奖旗。许多试制新产品有成绩的职工都得了奖金。贯彻为本地区农业经济服务的方针湖南省着手制定发展地方工业的全面规划
    新华社长沙10日电　新华社记者胡坚报道：湖南省地方工业部门已经开始注意全面地贯彻执行为本地区农业经济服务的方针。现在，不适合于湖南稻田中使用的双轮双铧犁已经停止生产。地方国营湖南农业机械厂正集中技术力量研究一种能适合于湖南水田中使用的双轮双铧犁和试制其他小型农业机械。供应湖南农民在秋收后种植绿肥拌种用的可供二十万亩使用的根瘤菌肥料，已经开始生产了。过去一直被忽视的各种农业副产品的加工工业，现在已经受到重视。
    湖南省工业厅在六月间抽调了三个处长级干部分别带领三个工作组，到丘陵区，山区和洞庭湖滨地区进行为时两到三个月的重点调查工作，以便了解农民的需要，按照湖南地区的特点，作出发展地方工业的全面规划。
    过去一个时期，湖南省地方工业为农业经济服务的思想是不够全面的。地方工业部门曾注意到农械、农具、农药等方面的生产，而忽视了有关红薯、油料、麻丝等农业副产品的加工工业，以及很少注意到各种供应人民需要的日用品和其他必需品的工业的发展。特别是缺少对湖南地区农业经济的调查研究，不能很好地从地区特点和人民需要出发，认真地贯彻执行为本地农业经济服务的方针。例如全省唯一的农业机械厂，今年上半年主要是生产北方旱地用的双轮双铧犁。地方国营长沙机械厂今年上半年生产的水泵只有一半是供应本省农村用的。今年供应农民的六万多台打稻机，由于抢时间、赶任务，形成粗制滥造，质量不好，许多农民不满意。最近湖南省工业厅领导方面已经对过去一个时期的地方工业工作进行了检查，要求全面贯彻执行为农业经济服务，并且同农业经济紧密结合的方针。
