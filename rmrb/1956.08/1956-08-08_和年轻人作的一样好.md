    As Good as the Young People
    In the Tuanjie (Unity) Production Team of the Dongfanghong (East is Red) First Agricultural Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, there are fifty-one older women who have contracted to manage 135 mu of cotton fields. Five of them were too old, and the team leader advised them not to work in the fields, but they clamored, "Everyone else is working in the fields, how can we just sit around?" The group leader had no choice but to agree to let each of them be responsible for the management of one mu of cotton field.
    But the work they do is quite beautiful. The cotton fields are hoed so softly that it is not easy to find a weed. The cotton seedlings are growing green and lush. The mother of社员 (Commune Member) He Shusen and another old woman are both sixty years old. The five mu of cotton they contracted to manage are as good as the young people's and is still the high-yield land of the cooperative! (Zhao Liancheng)

    和年轻人作的一样好
    在陕西大荔县东方红第一农业社的团结生产队里，有五十一个年纪较大的妇女，她们共包做了一百三十五亩棉花的田间管理工作。有五个年纪太大的，队长劝她们不要下地劳动，她们就嚷着说：“大伙都下地劳动，我们怎能坐的住呢？”组长无法，只好答应给她们每人负责一亩棉花田的管理工作。
    她们作的活却挺漂亮。棉田锄的软绵绵的，想找棵杂草也是不太容易的。棉苗都长的绿油油的，社员何树森的母亲和另一个老人都是六十岁的人了，他们包做的五亩棉花和年轻人作的一样好，还是社里的高额丰产地哩！　（赵连城）
