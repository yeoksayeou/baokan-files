    Automatic Weft Winding Machine
    (Reported by this newspaper) China's first self-made 1471 type automatic weft winding machine has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory.
    The 1471 type automatic weft winding machine has a precise and ingenious structure, and has complete safety devices. It is currently the most advanced textile machine. Its speed reaches 5,200 revolutions per minute, and its production efficiency is two to three times higher than that of old-fashioned machines. Because this machine is fully automated, the labor intensity of female textile workers is greatly reduced, and the safety of workers during operation is guaranteed. (Chai Peilin) (Attached picture)
