Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 22nd: Shaanxi Province will recently vigorously oppose subjectivism and commandism in rural work, especially in leading agricultural production. This is a major task on the ideological front that the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward to party organizations across the province at the provincial rural propaganda work conference held from August 9th to 16th.

The conference, while studying the new situations and new problems in rural areas, exposed subjectivism and commandism in rural work. With the arrival of the upsurge of cooperativization, a vigorous production upsurge has emerged throughout the province. However, under this new situation, subjective, one-sided, and commandist ideas and styles of work have grown among rural work cadres. In leading rural work, especially in leading agricultural production, many local leading organs disregard whether conditions permit, make decisions arbitrarily, and stipulate them too rigidly; lower-level cadres mechanically execute instructions from higher levels, do not consult with the masses when problems arise, and rely on administrative orders to promote work. Some places, according to a set of preconceived production schedules, order agricultural cooperatives to complete production tasks within a specified time.

With the development of this subjective style of thinking and work, bureaucracy and commandism among some grassroots cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres are also on the rise. In their work, they do not respect the opinions of the masses, forcing them to act according to overly rigid regulations, and even replacing arduous and meticulous persuasion and education with punitive measures such as "deducting work points" and "labeling." Work points are deducted, labor days are fined, or no work is assigned to members who do not observe discipline, engage in individual sideline production, are late for meetings, or even offer too many opinions. In more serious areas, phenomena such as making members stand at attention for reprimands, holding mass criticism meetings, and handing them over to production teams for control have occurred. At the same time, some areas do not pay enough attention to the lives and suffering of the masses.

This subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism have aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, suppressed the enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and brought not small losses to rural work, with deaths even occurring in severe areas.

Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, attendees discussed the reasons for these problems. The conference believed that these reasons were that our cadres lacked experience in many tasks under the conditions of establishing new relations of production; coupled with the fact that many cadres, in the face of the victory of agricultural cooperativization, developed complacency and arrogance, only saw the ease of leadership after organization and the high production enthusiasm of the peasants, mistakenly believing that after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives and the peasants embarking on the path of cooperativization economically, the peasants' ideology would naturally become socialist. Therefore, they only focused on grasping production and promoting technological reforms, neglecting the new contradictions arising in the new situation and neglecting the party's ideological education work. At the same time, when opposing right-leaning conservative ideas in rural work in the past, there was insufficient vigilance against the tendency of blind and rash advances in production, which fueled the tendency of production plans in many places being higher than the previous level, simply emphasizing quantity and speed. On the part of agricultural cooperative cadres, it was because they applied the patriarchal style of thinking and work formed by long-term small-scale peasant economic life to the leadership of agricultural cooperatives, treating agricultural cooperatives as administrative organizations and simply abusing administrative punishments when members of the cooperative had ideological problems or made occasional mistakes. From the perspective of the party's ideological work, the emergence of the above problems was mainly because the party's propaganda and education work failed to meet the requirements of the new situation after cooperativization and did not catch up in time.

In response to the problems existing in the work, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC decided to list the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism as a major task of party organizations across the province. It requires cadres above the level of county committee ministers of the CPC throughout the province to thoroughly examine the problems in leading rural work, especially in leading agricultural production, examine their ideological style of work, and propose practical improvement measures in the recent study of relevant documents on opposing subjectivism, in conjunction with the spirit of the documents. In addition to focusing on studying basic philosophical knowledge to correct their ways of thinking and working for the vast number of cadres, the main method is to thoroughly explain the new situation and new problems after cooperativization and the correct working methods that must be adopted, criticize subjective, one-sided, and commandist styles of thinking and work, and commend good people and good deeds through the upcoming three-level cadre meeting.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC also requires party organizations at all levels throughout the province to strengthen the leadership of political and ideological work so that the propaganda departments of the party at all levels can fully play their role as assistants. The primary task at present is to strengthen propaganda and education work, clarify the confused thinking among cadres and the masses. To this end, it is necessary to continue to deeply and specifically publicize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, and analyze the reasons for the shortcomings and errors in the work of agricultural cooperatives realistically and specifically, in order to educate cadres and educate the masses. All localities should strengthen the education on the relationship between individuals and the collective, mainly requiring cadres to care about the lives of cooperative members, learn to act in accordance with the mass line, promote democracy, listen to the opinions of cooperative members, unite all cooperative members, and run the agricultural cooperative well; educate the vast number of members to love the agricultural cooperative, love the collective, recognize their rights and obligations as masters of the agricultural cooperative, and supervise the cadres of the agricultural cooperative to improve their work. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate cadres and the masses to correctly implement the class policy in solving the problems of agricultural cooperatives. In carrying out rural political and ideological work, it is required that all agricultural cooperatives and production teams throughout the province have a deputy director and deputy captain specifically responsible for managing political work. Rural party branches should also mobilize all party members to lead activists to form propaganda teams to carry out regular propaganda work.

### 反对主观主义和强迫命令作风  陕西省加强农村中政治思想工作

    反对主观主义和强迫命令作风
    陕西省加强农村中政治思想工作
    据新华社西安22日电　陕西省在最近将大力反对农村工作中、特别是领导农业生产中的主观主义和强迫命令作风。这是中共陕西省委在八月九日至十六日召开的全省农村宣传工作会议上向全省党组织在思想战线上提出的一项主要任务。
    会议在研究当前农村的新形势与新问题时，揭发了农村工作中的主观主义和强迫命令作风。随着合作化高潮的到来，全省又出现了轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。但是在这种新的形势下，农村工作干部中却滋长起主观片面和强迫命令的思想作风。不少地方的领导机关在领导农村工作上，特别是领导农业生产上不顾条件可能与否，随意做出决定，而且规定过死过严；下面干部机械执行上级指示，遇事不和群众商量，依靠行政命令推动工作。有的地方按照主观设想的一套预先排定的生产进度表，命令农业社在指定时间内完成生产任务。
    随着这种主观主义思想作风的发展，有些基层干部和农业社干部中的官僚主义、强迫命令作风也在抬头。他们在工作中不尊重群众的意见，强使群众按照过死的规定办事，甚至在工作中用“扣工分”、“扣帽子”等惩罚手段代替艰苦细致的说服教育工作。遇有社员不遵守纪律、个人进行副业生产、开会迟到、甚至于提意见较多都要扣工分、罚劳动日或不派活给他做。较严重的地方还曾发生让社员立正训话、开大会斗争、交生产队管制等现象。同时，有些地区对群众的生活和疾苦关心的很不够。
    这种主观主义、官僚主义和强迫命令作风，引起了群众不满，抑制了农民群众的积极性，给农村工作带来不小损失，严重的地区还发生了死亡的现象。
    在省委的领导下，到会的人讨论了产生这些问题的原因。会议认为这些原因是在建立了新的生产关系的情况下，我们的干部在许多工作上都缺乏经验；加上许多干部在农业合作化的胜利面前，滋长了骄傲自满情绪，只看到组织起来以后容易领导，农民的生产热情高涨等许多有利条件，误认为建立起了农业社的形式，农民们在经济上走上合作化道路以后，农民思想也自然社会主义化了。因而只顾抓生产、推行技术改革，忽视了在新形势下产生的新的矛盾，忽视了党的思想教育工作。同时，在过去反对农村工作中的右倾保守思想的时候，对生产上可能产生的盲目冒进倾向警惕不足，助长了许多地方生产规划一级比一级高，单纯强调多、快的偏向。而在农业社干部方面，则是由于他们把长期的小农经济生活所形成的家长式的思想作风，运用到对农业社的领导工作上来，他们把农业社当作行政组织，遇到社员群众思想不通或偶有过错时，就简单地滥施行政处分。以上问题的产生，从党的思想工作方面进行检查，主要是因为党的宣传教育工作未能适合合作化后新形势的要求，没有及时地赶上去。
    针对工作中存在的问题，中共陕西省委决定把反对主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义的斗争列为目前全省党组织的一个主要任务。要求全省中共县委部长以上干部在最近学习反对主观主义的有关文件中，能够结合文件精神，彻底检查在领导农村工作，特别是在领导农业生产中的问题，检查思想作风，并提出切实的改进办法。对广大干部除围绕学习哲学常识以端正思想方法与工作方法外，主要是通过不久将要召开的三级干部会议，深入讲解合作化后的新形势、新问题和必须采取的正确的工作方法，批判主观片面、强迫命令等思想作风，表扬好人好事。
    中共陕西省委同时要求全省各级党组织加强对政治思想工作的领导，使各级党的宣传部门充分发挥助手作用。目前的首要任务是加强宣传教育工作，澄清干部、群众中的混乱思想，为此，必须继续深入具体地宣传农业社的优越性，并实事求是地具体分析农业社工作中产生缺点和错误的原因，以教育干部和教育群众。各地要加强个人和集体关系的教育，主要是要求干部关心社员群众的生活，学会按照群众路线办事，发扬民主，听取社员意见，团结全体社员群众，办好农业社；教育广大社员热爱农业社，热爱集体，认清自己作为农业社主人的权利和义务，监督农业社干部改进工作。同时，还要教育干部、群众在解决农业社的问题中正确贯彻阶级政策。在开展农村政治思想工作上，要求全省各农业社和生产队中都要有专门负责管理政治工作的副主任和副队长。农村党支部还要动员全体党员带动积极分子组成宣传队伍，开展经常性的宣传工作。
