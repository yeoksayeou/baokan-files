The Ministry of Finance Makes New Regulations on Tax Issues During the Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce

    (By our reporter) To address the new tax-related issues arising during the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance recently formulated the "Provisional Regulations on the Payment of Industry and Commerce Tax by Private Industry and Commerce During the Transformation Process." These regulations have now been approved by the State Council and will be implemented nationwide starting in August.

    The new regulations stipulate that for merged industrial enterprises operating jointly with unified accounting of profits and losses, the head factory will be the tax-paying unit. Transfers of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, as well as processing and repair services between the head factory and its branches and workshops, will not be subject to business tax. This greatly simplifies tax procedures, reduces the tax burden in this area, and facilitates enterprise accounting.

    The new regulations stipulate that for merged commercial enterprises adopting a system where each store reports accounts and the head store performs unified accounting, transfers of goods between the various stores will not be subject to business tax. Jointly operated commercial enterprises engaged in the wholesale of industrial products will no longer pay business tax. Jointly operated commercial enterprises acting as agents for purchases, sales, and wholesale will no longer pay business tax on purchases and sales but will only pay business tax on the handling fees earned. When joint purchasing organizations distribute purchased goods to various distribution units, they will not pay business tax.

    The new regulations fully consider the current practical difficulties faced by cooperative stores and cooperative groups organized by small merchants and peddlers. Cooperative stores or joint operation organizations with unified accounting and shared profits and losses will be exempt from business tax if their actual monthly gross profit is insufficient to cover wages. If the gross profit is sufficient to cover wages but insufficient for tax payments, business tax may be reduced or waived. If the gross profit is sufficient to cover wages and taxes but the operation still faces difficulties, a tax reduction of up to 30% of the payable income tax can be granted. The business tax rate for cooperative stores or joint operation organizations has also been simplified. The business tax rate for businesses selling goods is uniformly 3% of business income, the business tax rate for service industries is 3% or 5% of the revenue respectively, and the business tax rate for agency purchases, sales, and wholesale businesses is uniformly 7% of the handling fee revenue. In the future, enterprises engaging in multiple types of goods will no longer be taxed using multiple tax rates based on the industry to which each type of good belongs.

    Cooperative groups or joint operation organizations that do not perform unified accounting and are responsible for their own profits and losses will pay business tax at the same rate as cooperative stores and will no longer pay income tax. Those with tax payment difficulties may also receive tax reductions or exemptions.

    The tax collection methods for small merchants and peddlers have also undergone fundamental reforms, and the democratic appraisal method of collection has been abolished. Business tax for cooperative stores will be collected through the examination of accounts. Income tax will be calculated on the actual net profit after deducting expenses from the actual gross profit, with the expense rate determined by the state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives responsible for the transformation, according to the industry. This can greatly reduce disputes between taxpayers and tax collectors. For cooperative groups and individual small merchants and peddlers, a simple and easy fixed-amount collection method will be adopted. That is, based on the sales plan arranged by the central store (wholesale store) of the state-owned commercial enterprise and supply and marketing cooperative for each member of the cooperative group and each small merchant and peddler, the total annual tax payable for each household will be determined, and the monthly tax amount will be determined according to the peak and off seasons and paid monthly, without adjustment within the year. The tax payments of the cooperative groups will be collected and remitted by the central store (wholesale store) established by the state-owned commercial enterprise and supply and marketing cooperative.

    The regulations formulated by the Ministry of Finance can solve the main tax-related problems currently existing in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. The Ministry of Finance has now, based on these regulations, instructed local tax authorities to quickly implement them.

### 关于私营工商业在改造过程中的纳税问题  财政部作了新的规定

    关于私营工商业在改造过程中的纳税问题
    财政部作了新的规定
    本报讯　为了解决在私营工商业的社会主义改造过程中税收上出现的新问题，财政部最近制定了
  “关于对私营工商业在改造过程中交纳工商业税的暂行规定”。这个规定，现在已经国务院批准，八月份起即将在全国实行。
    新的规定，对实行并厂合营，统一核算盈亏的合营工业，以总厂为纳税单位。总厂所属各分厂和车间相互间调拨原材料、半成品、成品以及相互进行加工、修理等业务，不交纳营业税。这样就大大的简化了税务手续，减轻了这方面的税负，便利了企业的经济核算。
    新的规定，对并店合营，采取由各门市部报账，总店统一核算的合营商业，各个门市部间相互调拨货物，不纳营业税。合营商业经营工业品的批发业务，不再交纳营业税。合营商业代购、代销、代批不再按进销货交纳营业税，只就所得手续费交纳营业税。联购组织把购入的商品分配给各分销单位时，不交纳营业税等。
    对小商小贩组织起来的合作商店、合作小组目前经营上的实际困难，新的规定给予了充分照顾。对统一核算共负盈亏的合作商店或联营组织，一个月实际所得毛利尚不够支付工资的免征营业税，仅够支付工资但不够纳税的，可以减征或免征营业税；毛利收入够支付工资和纳税，但经营上还有困难的，还可以在应纳所得税额的30％的幅度内给予减税照顾。合作商店或联营组织的营业税税率也加以简化。经营商品销售的行业一律按营业收入的3％，服务性行业分别按收益的3％或5％，代购、代销、代批业务一律按手续费收益的7％。今后在一个企业内经营多种商品的，不再采用按所属行业分别适用多种税率计税的办法。
    对不统一核算，自负盈亏的合作小组或联营组织营业税，比照合作商店的营业税税率交纳，不再交纳所得税。其中纳税有困难的，还可得到减税或免税的照顾。
    对小商小贩的征税方法亦作了根本的改革，取消了民主评议的征收方法。对合作商店的营业税改为查账征收；所得税按实际毛利收入减除费用开支后的纯利依率计征，费用开支则根据负责改造的国营商业、供销合作社按行业核定的费用率计算。这样可以大大减少征纳双方的争议。对合作小组及个体小商小贩，一律采取简单易行的定期定额的征收办法，即根据国营商业、供销合作社的中心店（批发店）对合作小组各成员及小商小贩安排的销货计划，确定各户全年的应纳税额，分别淡旺季节核定各月税额，按月交纳，在一年内不作调整。合作小组的税款，由国营商业、供销合作社所设的中心店（批发店）汇集代交。
    财政部所制定的这个规定，对于当前私营工商业的社会主义改造中在纳税上存在的主要问题可以得到解决。现在财政部已根据这个规定，布置各地税务机关迅速贯彻执行。
