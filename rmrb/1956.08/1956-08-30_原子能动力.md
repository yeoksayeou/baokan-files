    Atomic Energy Power
    Professor of Power Machinery Department, Tsinghua University, Wu Zhonghua

    On June 27, 1954, the world's first industrial atomic power plant built by the Soviet Academy of Sciences began to supply electricity to nearby industrial and agricultural users. It can be said that this marks the beginning of a new era of atomic energy power. The success of atomic energy power has brought humanity a great prospect of transforming nature and improving life, because the energy that can be released by the atomic energy fuels uranium and thorium stored on the earth is more than twenty times greater than the energy that can be released by all organic fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas stored on the earth. Atomic energy power solves our power problems for a long time to come, and it also breaks the regional restrictions on fuel. Now we can build power stations in any remote area or area lacking coal and oil, without worrying about the long-distance transportation of fuel.

    The main difference between the atomic power plant using steam cycle and the ordinary steam power plant is in the steam generator part, that is, the coal-fired boiler in the ordinary steam power plant is replaced by a nuclear reactor and a tube-type steam generator. In the reactor, the atomic fuel releases a large amount of heat energy through a nuclear fission chain reaction, which is used to generate steam. There are three substances that can continue to maintain the chain reaction: uranium-235, uranium-233, and plutonium-239. Of these three substances, only uranium-235 exists in natural uranium, so it is currently the most used atomic fuel. However, only 0.7% of natural uranium is uranium-235, so a substance called a moderator is generally used in nuclear reactors to reduce the speed of neutrons released after uranium-235 fission, so that they have more opportunities to make other uranium-235 fission and continue to maintain the chain reaction. This type of reactor that uses a moderator to reduce the speed of neutrons is called a slow neutron reactor. Slow neutron reactors are also called thermal reactors, because in this type of reactor, the kinetic energy of neutrons is reduced by the moderator to a range similar to that of nuclear kinetic energy, and the magnitude of the kinetic energy depends on their temperature. In thermal reactors, if artificial methods are used to increase the concentration of uranium-235 so that it is greater than 0.7%, the requirements for the moderator can be reduced. When the concentration of uranium-235 reaches a certain level, the moderator can be completely eliminated. This type of reactor is called a fast neutron reactor.

    The nuclear reactor used in the atomic power plant of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is a slow neutron reactor using graphite as a moderator, and uranium rods with a uranium-235 concentration of 5% are used as fuel. Under rated conditions, it consumes 30 grams of uranium (equivalent to 100 tons of coal) every 24 hours, and the heat generation is 30,000 kilowatts. This nuclear reactor uses water at 100 atmospheres to absorb and transmit heat energy. At rated load, the water flow rate is 300 tons per hour. After passing through the nuclear reactor, the water temperature rises from 190 degrees Celsius to 260 to 270 degrees Celsius, and then enters 6 steam generators. The steam obtained in this way then enters an ordinary steam turbine to work and drive the generator. In the nuclear reactor, nuclear fission and fission fragments emit strong neutron fluxes and beta and gamma rays. In order to prevent these radioactive rays from harming the human body, this nuclear reactor and evaporator are placed in a protector composed of one meter of water and three meters of cement. Under rated conditions, the power generated by the steam turbine is 5,000 kilowatts. For two years, this power station has been operating normally and has never had an accident. Although it is the first atomic power plant, its power generation cost can already be compared with the power generation cost of a steam power plant with the same power that burns expensive coal.

    The Soviet Union will build a more economical atomic power plant with a power of 100,000 kilowatts this year. Within five years, five giant atomic power plants with a power of 400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts, as well as several experimental power nuclear reactors of various types with a power of 50,000 to 70,000 kilowatts, will be built.

    Up to now, more than 150 design suggestions for power reactors have been made. Among them, the ones with greater hope and are being tested and built, in addition to the one mentioned above, include the following, most of which belong to the thermal reactor type. At the Soviet Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy Science and Technology Exhibition held in Beijing recently, there was a design drawing of a 200,000-kilowatt atomic power plant. Its power reactor uses water as a moderator and heat transfer medium. The power equipment of an atomic power plant, an atomic submarine, and an atomic aircraft carrier currently being built in the United States also use this type of reactor.

    At the Soviet Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy Science and Technology Exhibition held in Beijing recently, there was also a design drawing of a 100,000-kilowatt power reactor using heavy water as a moderator and carbon dioxide as a heat transfer medium, and a design drawing of a power reactor using graphite as a moderator and water as a heat transfer medium. Graphite has a strong moderation ability, so uranium-235 with a relatively low concentration can be used as fuel, or natural uranium can be used. Heavy water has a stronger moderation ability, and natural uranium can be used as fuel. The advantage of using carbon dioxide as a heat transfer medium is that the pressure borne by the reactor can be greatly reduced, but it requires a relatively large power to transport the gas. The atomic power plant that the United Kingdom will build this year uses graphite as a moderator and carbon dioxide as a heat transfer medium, and each reactor generates 23,000 kilowatts of power.

    The other two very promising slow neutron power reactor types are boiling reactors and graphite-sodium liquid reactors. In a boiling reactor, water evaporates directly in the reactor, so a primary heat transfer system can be saved, and the thermal efficiency of the steam cycle can be improved, but the fuel requires a relatively high concentration of uranium-235, and the steam is radioactive, so all equipment must be placed in a protector. The advantage of using liquid metals such as sodium as a heat transfer medium is that it has high heat transfer capacity and boiling point, and the pressure borne by the reactor is low. For example, in the design of a graphite-sodium reactor, the outlet temperature of the sodium liquid is 496 degrees Celsius, so higher temperature water vapor and higher thermal efficiency can be obtained. The disadvantage is that the radioactivity of the sodium liquid is high and it must be prevented from contacting water to avoid a strong chemical reaction. Usually, a sodium-potassium liquid intermediate heat transfer system is added between the sodium liquid (heat transfer medium) and water (working medium) in this type of reactor.

    The simplest type of power reactor is a homogeneous reactor. In this type of reactor, the fissile material (such as uranium-233) is evenly dissolved or suspended in liquid heavy water that serves as a moderator and heat transfer medium. At this time, the reactor must have a certain volume so that the fissile material contained in the liquid inside the reactor is greater than the minimum mass that can maintain a chain reaction. In addition to the advantage of simple structure, in this type of reactor, the utilization rate of fissile material is high, and fission products can be continuously and easily removed and new fuel can be added. Another advantage is that the heat energy released by nuclear fission can be transferred to the working medium outside the reactor. The disadvantage is that the flowing liquid is radioactive, so a tight circulation system is necessary. Currently, homogeneous reactors generally use uranium sulfate or uranium nitrate as fuel and heavy water or ordinary water as a moderator and heat transfer medium.

    If heavy water containing thorium oxide flows around the fissile material in the above-mentioned homogeneous reactor, thorium-232 can be converted into uranium-233 after absorbing neutrons. Uranium-233 is a fissile material that can maintain a chain reaction. Because the amount of uranium-233 obtained is slightly more than the uranium-235 used. In this type of reactor, in addition to obtaining heat energy, more new fissile material can be obtained. This type of reactor is called a breeder reactor. Uranium-233 can be well used as fuel for reactors.

    There is also a fast neutron reactor that uses sodium liquid for heat transfer. The characteristic of a fast neutron reactor is that it can be made very small, and it can convert uranium-238 placed in this reactor into plutonium-239. Plutonium-239, like uranium-235, can absorb slow neutrons or fast neutrons and fission, and can be used as fuel in power reactors, or it can be used to generate atomic explosions like sodium-235 and uranium-233. Because there is no moderator to absorb neutrons in a fast neutron reactor, the multiplication coefficient of this type of reactor can reach a relatively high value. This type of reactor is particularly useful when a large amount of atomic fuel is needed in the future.

    With the different fissile materials used in various reactors and whether there is a breeding task, the preparation and reprocessing process of fissile materials are also different. After the natural uranium ore is processed by ordinary smelting methods, it is made into natural uranium ingots. Natural uranium ingots can be directly made into uranium rods for use as fuel, or the uranium-235 and uranium-238 in them can be separated through a physical process. Uranium-235 can be used to enrich the uranium-235 component in natural uranium, or it can be directly used as atomic fuel. Uranium-238 can be used in fast neutron breeder reactors to become the fissile material plutonium-234.

    During the operation of the reactor, continuous nuclear fission reduces the concentration of fissile material contained in the uranium rods, and some products after nuclear fission also absorb neutrons. When the number of fission nuclei reaches a certain number, the uranium rods must be removed, some fission products must be removed by chemical and physical methods, and uranium-238, uranium-235, and plutonium-239 must be separated for separate use. For example, in the Soviet Union's first atomic power plant, every two months, when 15% of the uranium-235 contained in the uranium rods is used up, or its concentration decreases from 5% to 4.2%, the uranium rods are taken out for reprocessing.

    An atomic power plant must have very thorough safety measures. When the control rod system, heat transfer system, or uranium rod system fails, even if the control system has lost power supply, it must be able to immediately and safely stop the reactor from working. In order to prevent the possibility of safety device failure, the reactor is usually placed in an underground steel cylinder, and the power station is placed a few miles away from the city.

    The greatest characteristic of atomic energy power is the extremely large amount of energy that can be released per unit volume or per unit weight of atomic fuel. This is particularly advantageous for transportation applications. For example, the atomic icebreaker currently being built in the Soviet Union has a power (44,000 horsepower) that exceeds one and a half times that of ordinary icebreakers, and its range is ten to twelve times greater than that of ordinary icebreakers, and it can operate for one year without stopping at ports. The particularly advantageous application of atomic energy power in submarines is also well known. According to recent calculations by Soviet scientists, on cargo ships with a deadweight of more than 10,000 tons and a speed of more than 11 knots, the use of atomic energy power is much cheaper than the use of currently used power equipment in terms of construction cost and transportation cost, so the application of atomic energy power in ships will develop rapidly.

    The application of atomic energy in transportation tools that is of even greater significance than atomic ships is atomic energy aircraft. It is much more difficult to use atomic energy power on airplanes than on ships, but Soviet scientists and technicians successfully completed the first test flight of an atomic energy aircraft at the end of 1955. This atomic energy aircraft used an atomic reactor to replace the kerosene combustion chamber in an ordinary gas turbine jet engine. The use of atomic energy power can make airplanes fly farther and faster. Because there is no need to land and refuel in the middle, this type of aircraft is most suitable for long-distance flights. We can expect that in the near future, this atomic energy aircraft will shorten the travel time between Moscow and Beijing to a few hours. This type of aircraft of course has its particularly significant value in the military. At the same time, its success has also advanced the possibility of space flight a big step forward.

    Atomic energy power devices for practical applications will appear in a variety of forms. It can be a thermal reactor or a fast neutron reactor. It can use graphite as a moderator, or it can use heavy water or light water as a moderator, or even use no moderator at all. It can use a boron layer to shield neutrons, or it can use a water layer or graphite layer to shield neutrons, it can use a lead layer to shield gamma rays, or it can use a cement layer or steel plate to shield gamma rays. It can use liquid metal or water to absorb the heat energy released after nuclear fission, or it can use gases such as carbon dioxide, helium, and hydrogen to absorb heat energy. It can drive steam turbines to generate power through steam, or it can drive gas turbines to generate power through high-temperature gas or generate propulsion through high-speed jets. In theory, it is also possible to use heat energy to generate electricity through thermocouples and use nuclear fission to directly obtain current, and even further use the fusion reaction of deuterium nuclei and super-heavy hydrogen nuclei to produce greater energy. There are endless possibilities in front of us, waiting for scientists and technicians all over the world to explore and create. (Attached picture)

    原子能动力
    清华大学动力机械系教授　吴仲华
    1954年6月27日苏联科学院建成的世界第一座工业原子能发电站开始向附近工业农业用户送电。可以说，这就是原子能动力新时代的开始。原子能动力的成功，给人类带来了改造自然和改善生活的伟大远景，因为地球上蕴藏的原子能燃料铀和钍所能够发出的能量，要比地球上蕴藏的煤炭、石油、天然气等所有有机燃料能够发出的能量大二十倍以上。原子能动力给我们解决了将来很长一段时间内的动力问题，它还打破了燃料的地区性限制。现在我们可以在任何边远地区或者缺乏煤、油的地区建立发电站，不必耽心燃料的长距离运输问题。
    现在使用蒸汽循环来工作的原子能发电站同普通蒸汽发电站的主要不同处是在蒸汽发生器部分，即普通蒸汽发电站中燃烧煤的锅炉是由原子核反应堆和一种管子式的蒸汽发生器代替了。在反应堆中的原子燃料，通过核分裂的链式反应放出大量的热能，用来产生蒸汽。可以继续维持链式反应的物质有铀—235、铀—233和钚—239三种。这三种物质，只有铀—235存在在天然铀中，所以它是目前用得最多的一种原子燃料。但是在天然铀中，也只有0.7％是铀—235，所以在原子核反应堆中一般都使用一种叫做减速剂的物质来降低铀—235分裂以后放出中子的速度，以便它们有更多的机会使其他的铀—235分裂而继续维持链式反应。这种采用减速剂来降低中子速度的反应堆，称为慢中子反应堆。慢中子反应堆又称作热反应堆，因为在这种反应堆中，中子的动能被减速剂降低到同核子动能相似的范围，而动能的大小决定于他们温度的高低。在热反应堆中，假使用人工方法增加铀—235的浓度，使它大于0.7％，就可以减少对减速剂的要求。当铀—235的浓度达到一定程度的时候，就可以完全不用减速剂。这种反应堆，称为快中子反应堆。
    苏联科学院原子能发电站所用的原子核反应堆，是采用石墨作减速剂的一个慢中子反应堆，用铀—235的浓度为5％的铀棒作为燃料，在额定情况下，每二十四小时消耗三十克铀（相当于一百吨煤），发热量是三万瓩。这个原子核反应堆采用在一百个大气压下的水来吸收和传送热能。在额定负荷时，水的流量是每小时三百吨。经过原子核反应堆以后，水的温度从摄氏190度升高到摄氏260到270度，然后进入6个蒸汽发生器。这样得到的蒸汽再进入一个普通蒸汽轮中工作，来推动发电机。在原子核反应堆中，核分裂和分裂以后的碎片都发出很强的中子流以及乙种、丙种射线。为了防止这些放射线对人体的伤害，这座原子核反应堆和蒸发器是放在一个用一米厚的水和三米厚的水泥组成的保护器内的。在额定情况下，蒸汽轮发出的功率是五千瓩。两年以来，这个发电站一直运行正常，从来没有发生过事故。虽然它是第一个原子能发电站，它的发电成本已经可以同功率相同而燃烧贵煤的蒸汽发电站的发电成本相比。
    苏联将在今年建成一座更经济的、功率为十万瓩的原子能发电站。在五年内，还将建成五座功率为四十万到六十万瓩的巨型原子能发电站，以及若干五万到七万瓩各种式样的试验性的动力原子核反应堆。
    到现在为止，关于动力反应堆的设计的建议已经超过了一百五十种。其中希望比较大的并且正在试验和建造中的，除了上面提到的一种以外，还有下述几种，其中绝大部分都属于热反应堆类型。最近在北京举行的苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会上，曾经有一个二十万瓩原子能发电站的设计图。它的动力反应堆是采用水作减速剂和传热质。美国目前正在建造的一座原子能发电站、一只原子潜水舰和一只原子航空母舰的动力设备，也都采用这种反应堆。
    最近在北京举行的苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会里，还曾经有一个用重水做减速剂、用二氧化炭为传热质、功率为十万瓩的动力反应堆的设计图，和一个用石墨为减速剂、用水为传热质的动力反应堆的设计图，石墨的减速能力强，所以可以使用浓度比较低的铀—235为燃料，或者使用天然铀。重水的减速能力更强，完全可以使用天然铀为燃料。用二氧化炭为传热质的好处是反应堆承受的压力可以大大降低，但是需要消耗比较大的输送气体的功率。英国将在今年建成的一座原子能发电站，就是用石墨作减速剂和用二氧化炭作传热质的，每个反应堆发出的功率是二万三千瓩。
    另外两种很有希望的慢中子动力反应堆类型是沸腾反应堆和石墨—钠液反应堆。在沸腾反应堆中，水直接在反应堆内蒸发，因此可以省掉一次传热系统，并且可以提高蒸汽循环的热效率，但是燃料需要铀—235的浓度比较高，并且蒸汽带有放射性，所以全部设备都得放在防护器内。用钠这一类液态金属来作传热质的好处，是它的传热能力和沸点高，并且反应堆承受的压力低。譬如，在一个石墨—钠反应堆的设计中，钠液的出口温度是摄氏四百九十六度，因此可以得到较高温度的水蒸汽和较高的热效率。它的缺点是钠液的放射性高并且必须避免和水接触，以免发生强烈的化学反应。通常这种反应堆在钠液（传热质）和水（工作质）之间，还加用一道钠—钾液组成的中间传热系统。
    最简单一种动力反应堆是均匀反应堆。在这种反应堆中，可分裂物质（如铀—233）均匀地溶解在或者浮悬在作为减速剂和传热质的液体重水中。这时，反应堆必须具有一定的体积，使得包含在反应堆内液体中的可分裂物质大于它能够维持链式反应的最低质。除了构造简单的好处以外，在这种反应堆中，分裂物质的使用率大，并且可以连续地和比较容易地除去分裂产物和添加新的燃料。另外一个好处是核子分裂放出的热能可以在反应器外面传给工作质。它的缺点是在流动中的液体具有放射性，因此必需有一个严密的循环系统。目前一般均匀反应堆用硫酸铀或者硝酸铀作为燃料，用重水或者普通水作为减速剂和传热质。
    假若使含有氧化钍的重水在上述均匀反应堆中可分裂物质的周围流过，钍—232吸收中子以后就可以变成铀—233。铀—233是一种可以维持链式反应的分裂物质。因为得到铀—233的数量比用去的铀—235的还多一点。在这种反应堆中，除了得到热能以外，还可以多得出一些新的可分裂物质。这种反应堆称为倍增或增殖反应堆。铀—233是可以很好地用作反应堆的燃料的。
    还有一种用钠液来传热的快中子反应堆。快中子反应堆的特点是它可以做得很小，并且可以把放在这种反应堆中的铀—238变成钚—239。钚239和铀235一样，可以吸收慢中子或者快中子而分裂，可以用为动力反应堆中的燃料，也可以同钠—235、铀—233一样，用来发生原子爆炸。因为在快中子反应堆中没有减速剂吸收中子，这种反应堆的倍增系数可以达到比较高的数值。将来需要大量原子燃料的时候，这种反应堆是特别有用的。
    随着各种反应堆使用可分裂物质的不同以及有没有增殖任务，可分裂物质的制备和重制过程也有所不同。天然铀矿经过通常的冶炼方法以后，制成天燃铀锭。天燃铀锭可以直接制成铀棒作为燃料用，或者经过物理过程把其中的铀235和铀—238分开。铀—235可以用来浓化天然铀中铀—235的成分，或者直接用来作为原子燃料。铀238可以用在快中子增殖反应堆中，变成可分裂物质钚—234。
    在反应堆的工作过程中，不断的核子分裂使得铀棒中所含的可分裂物质的浓度减小，并且核子分裂后的一些产物还吸收中子。当分裂核子的数目到达一定数目的时候，就必须把铀棒取去，用化学和物理方法把一些分裂产物除去，并且把铀—238、铀—235和钚—239分开，以便分别使用。譬如在苏联第一个原子能发电站中，每隔二月，当铀棒中所含的铀—235用掉15％的时候，或者它的浓度从5％降低到4.2％的时候，就把铀棒取出重制。
    一个原铀能发电站必须有很周密的安全措施。不论是控制棒系统、传热系统或者铀棒系统发生故障的时候，即使控制系统已经失掉动力供应，也必须能够立刻把反应堆安全地停止作用。为了防止安全装置失效的可能性，通常还把反应堆放在地下钢筒内，并且把发电站放在离城几里以外的地方。
    原子能动力的最大特点，是原子燃料每单位体积或者每单位重量所能发出的极其巨大的能量。这对于交通运输上的应用是特别有利的。譬如，目前苏联正在建造的原子破冰船，它的功率（四万四千匹马力）超过了普通破冰船的一倍半，它的航程比普通破冰船大十到十二倍，可以一年不用停靠港口。原子能动力在潜水艇上特殊有利的应用也是人们都知道的。根据最近苏联科学家们的计算，在载重超过一万吨、航速超过十一浬的货船上，采用原子能动力比采用现在通用的动力设备，在造价和运输成本方面都便宜很多，所以原子能动力在船舶上的应用将会发展得很快。
    比原子能轮船更具有重大意义的原子能在交通运输工具上的应用是原子能飞机。在飞机上使用原子能动力要比在船上困难得多，但是苏联的科学技术工作者在1955年年底已经胜利地完成了原子能飞机的第一次试飞。这一架原子能飞机使用了一个原子反应堆来替代普通燃气轮喷气发动机中的煤油燃烧室。利用原子能动力，可以使飞机飞得远并且飞得快。因为不需要在中途降落和加油，这种飞机对于长距离的飞行最为合适。我们可以预计在不久的将来，这种原子能飞机将使莫斯科和北京间的来往时间缩短到几个小时。这种飞机当然在军事上更是有它的特别重大的价值。同时，它的成功也把宇宙飞行的可能性向前推进了一大步。
    实际应用的原子能动力装置将以多种多样的形式出现。它可以是热反应堆，也可以是快中子反应堆。它可以用石墨作减速剂，也可以用重水或者轻水作减速剂，甚至完全不用减速剂。它可以用硼层来挡御中子，也可以用水层或者石墨层来挡御中子，它可以用铅层来挡御丙种射线，也可以用水泥层或者钢板来挡御丙种射线。它可以用液态金属或者水来吸收核子分裂以后放出的热能，也可以用二氧化炭、氦、氢等气体来吸收热能。它可以通过蒸汽来推动蒸汽轮产生动力，也可以通过高温气体来推动气轮机产生动力或者通过高速喷气来产生推进力。在理论上它还可能利用热能经过热电偶来发电和利用核分裂来直接得到电流，甚至更进一步利用重氢核和超重氢核的聚合反应来得出更大的能量。摆在我们前面的是无穷无尽的可能性，它们在等待全世界的科学技术工作者去发掘，去创造。（附图片）
