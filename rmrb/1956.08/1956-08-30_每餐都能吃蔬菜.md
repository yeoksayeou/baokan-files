Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 28th—Personnel from the Northwest Geological Bureau's 632 Team working in the Qaidam Basin have been able to eat fresh vegetables with every meal since August. In the team's cafeteria, people can enjoy dishes such as string beans with sliced pork, green peppers with shredded pork, braised eggplant, winter melon with pork, onions with pork, and tomato scrambled eggs.

    The leaders of the 632 Team attach great importance to improving the diet of the geological personnel. They frequently send people to Xining, Lanzhou, and other places to purchase vegetables and other non-staple foods, which are then brought into the basin in batches by the transportation team's vehicles. Since July, the team has also dispatched special vehicles to Lanzhou and other places to transport green vegetables and other non-staple foods, and has newly dug two vegetable cellars to store more than ten kinds of fresh vegetables. Most of the green vegetables that can be bought in Xining and Lanzhou are available here. Recently, the team also transported twenty fat pigs from Xining, and they also sent people to Daotanghe on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to purchase sheep.

    每餐都能吃蔬菜
    新华社西宁28日电　在柴达木盆地工作的西北地质局六三二队的人员，8月份以来每餐都能吃上新鲜蔬菜。人们在这个队的食堂里，可以吃到豆角炒肉片、青辣子炒肉丝、红烧茄子、冬瓜熬肉、洋葱炒肉、蕃茄炒鸡蛋等菜肴。
    六三二队领导人员对改善地质人员的膳食很重视。他们经常派人到西宁、兰州等地采购蔬菜等副食品，买下后由运输队的汽车分批捎进盆地。7月份以来，这个队还抽派专车到兰州等地去运青菜和其他副食品，并新挖两个菜窑储放十多种新鲜蔬菜。在西宁兰州等地能买到的青菜，这里大部分都有。最近，这个队又从西宁运来了二十口肥毛猪，他们还派人到青藏公路线上的倒淌河去采购羊只。
