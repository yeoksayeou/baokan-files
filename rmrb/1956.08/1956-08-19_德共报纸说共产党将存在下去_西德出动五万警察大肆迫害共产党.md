Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 18th: The German Communist newspaper "People's Voice" in Stuttgart published a commentary on the 17th, denouncing the West German Federal Constitutional Court's declaration banning the German Communist Party.

It said: "The German Communist Party exists and will continue to exist." "Hitlers disappeared, but the Communist Party still exists. Adenauers come and go, but the Communist Party will continue to exist. What Hitler and his barbaric system could not do, Adenauer cannot do either. Many people have tried to destroy Marxism, but Marxism has outlived them all."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 18th: Bonn dispatch: After Adenauer's government pushed the Federal Constitutional Court to illegally declare the German Communist Party banned, it immediately dispatched 50,000 police officers across West Germany to persecute the German Communist Party vigorously.

    德共报纸说共产党将存在下去
    西德出动五万警察大肆迫害共产党
    新华社柏林18日电　斯图加特的德国共产党报纸“人民之声报”十七日发表评论，痛斥西德联邦宪法法院宣布禁止德国共产党。
    它说：“德国共产党存在着而且将继续存在下去。”“希特勒之流消逝了，但是共产党仍旧存在。阿登纳之类来了又去，但是共产党将存在下去。希特勒和他的野蛮制度所做不到的事，阿登纳也做不到。许多人曾经企图摧毁马克思主义，但是马克思主义活得比他们都长久。”
    据新华社柏林18日电　波恩消息：阿登纳政府在促使联邦宪法法院非法宣布禁止德国共产党以后，紧接着就发动了西德各地的五万名警察对德国共产党大肆迫害。
