    A Message to Metallurgical Factories
    Chen Yusun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of the First Automobile Works
    As the people of the whole country jubilantly celebrate the successful trial assembly of the first batch of domestically produced automobiles, we propose that domestic metallurgical factories guarantee the supply of steel that meets the requirements of automobile production. This is a crucial problem that urgently needs to be solved for the First Automobile Works, which is about to start full-scale operation. If this problem cannot be solved in time, it will affect the production of the automobile factory and hinder the development of China's automobile and tractor industry. We believe that this problem can be solved smoothly with the attention of the people of the whole country and the relevant departments of the Central Government, coupled with the support of the metallurgical factory workers. However, some comrades are not yet aware of this problem, and I would like to put forward our views for comrades to refer to.
    Automobiles must run on various roads in urban and rural areas, over long and short distances. Automobiles are required to have a large load capacity, high speed, and flexible maneuverability. Automobiles should not only be used for transportation but also be adapted to many other uses, such as military and medical purposes. Therefore, to produce automobiles, it is necessary to require the metallurgical industry to supply steel with certain special technical requirements. The "Liberation" brand automobile is a medium-sized truck (load capacity of four tons). Each automobile weighs 3.7 tons, and nearly three tons of steel are required to produce one automobile. These steels include various types of steel, special section steel, steel pipes, steel plates, and steel strips made of carbon steel and alloy steel. In terms of steel types, they are not special, and domestic metallurgical plants have long been able to smelt them; however, their specifications are numerous, and the quality requirements are strict—in addition to general technical requirements, there are also special technical requirements. Although domestic metallurgical factories have not produced these steels with special technical requirements in large quantities in the past, judging from the existing conditions of China's metallurgical industry today, they can basically be produced. However, some metallurgical factories are currently unwilling to accept certain special technical requirements, which affects the supply of steel. We hope that this situation will attract the attention of relevant departments.
    The production of steel for automobiles requires special technical requirements, which are mainly determined by design, process, and equipment requirements. I will give a few examples here to illustrate this.
    There are 102 kinds of forging blanks in automobile parts. The steel used for these forgings is mostly hot-rolled high-quality carbon structural steel and alloy structural steel. Take 40 high-quality carbon structural steel as an example; it is used to manufacture connecting rods in the cylinder block. The function of the connecting rod is to connect the piston and crankshaft in the cylinder block and transmit energy back and forth. This part must have high strength and good fatigue resistance. If the quality of the steel used is not good, it will be damaged, broken, and even break the entire engine. Therefore, the steel used to manufacture this part has special technical requirements.
    Some forgings are made of steel on flat forging machines. They require precise steel dimensions. This is because the size and volume of the male and female molds used to manufacture parts on flat forging machines are fixed, and the size of the chuck is also fixed. If the steel size is slightly larger, it will cause defects such as flash folding, or even jam the material and mold cavity, causing flat forging machine damage accidents. If the steel size is slightly smaller, the chuck will not clamp tightly, and jumping will occur during forging, which will also cause defects. This requirement for precise dimensions is determined by the process equipment and the characteristics of the assembly line production of automobiles. In the past, when signing trial production contracts, the comrades of the automobile factory sometimes did not explain this situation in detail, so some comrades in the metallurgical factory were unwilling to accept this requirement. However, sometimes, after Soviet experts stationed in the automobile factory explained in detail to the metallurgical factory, some metallurgical factories still refused to accept this requirement on the pretext. We believe that this situation is not good.
    The raw materials for automobile body wing panels, mudguards, and other parts are cold-rolled and hot-rolled steel sheets. This kind of steel sheet must have good deep-drawing performance. When the automobile factory was adjusting production, it used steel sheets produced in the Soviet Union and trial-produced in China for simultaneous testing. The former became a qualified part with a smooth surface and no cracks after being cold-stamped on stamping equipment, while the latter cracked after being cold-stamped. Through actual tests, the technical personnel sent by the metallurgical factory also recognized that the special technical requirements for steel sheets put forward by the automobile factory were necessary.
    In short, the steel required to produce high-quality domestically produced automobiles cannot be compared with ordinary steel. In order to produce high-quality automobiles, the First Automobile Works needs to study hard, and at the same time, it needs the joint efforts of various domestic cooperating factories and metallurgical factories. Steel is an important raw material for automobile production and is closely related to the quality and cost of automobiles. Therefore, automobile production is actually the crystallization of the mechanical industry and the metallurgical industry, requiring joint efforts from both sides. The automobile industry often puts forward requirements to the metallurgical industry to improve technology and improve the quality of steel. This is not a technical debate issue, but the actual need of automobile production.
    At present, China's metallurgical industry indeed cannot meet the needs of China's automobile industry. This is a real contradiction. We believe that the comrades in the metallurgical industry will never allow our automobile manufacturing plant's assembly line production to rely on foreign steel supplies for a long time. We hope that domestic metallurgical factories will actively take measures to produce more and better steel to continuously supply the needs of automobile production.

### 寄语冶金工厂

    寄语冶金工厂
    第一汽车制造厂冶金处处长　陈禹孙
    当全国人民为庆贺第一批国产汽车试装成功而欢欣鼓舞的时候，我们提出，希望国内冶金工厂保证供应适合汽车生产要求的钢材。这对即将全面开工的第一汽车制造厂来说，是一个急待解决的关键性问题。这个问题如果不能及时解决，将会影响汽车厂的生产，阻碍我国汽车拖拉机工业的发展。我们认为，这个问题只要得到全国人民和中央有关部门的重视，加上国内冶金工厂职工同志们的支持，是可以顺利解决的。但是，目前有些同志对这个问题还不太了解，我想把我们的看法提出来供同志们参考。
    汽车要在城乡各种不同的道路上行驶，要跑长途、短途。汽车要求载重量大，速度快，调动灵活。汽车不但要用于运输方面，还要能适应许多其他的用途，如军用、医用等。因此，要生产汽车，就不能不要求冶金工业部门供应某些特殊技术要求的钢材。“解放牌”汽车是中型载重汽车（载重量四吨）。每辆汽车自重三点七吨，生产一辆汽车需用的钢材近三吨。这些钢材包括由炭素钢、合金钢制成的各种型钢、特殊断面钢、钢管、钢板和钢带等。按其钢种来说，并不特殊，国内各冶金厂早已能够冶炼；但是它们的规格是繁多的，质量要求是严格的——除了一般的技术要求以外，还有特殊的技术要求。这些有着特殊技术要求的钢材，国内冶金工厂过去虽然没有大量生产过，但从今天我国冶金工业现有条件来看，基本上都能够生产。但是，目前有些冶金厂不肯接受某些特殊的技术要求，以致影响了钢材的供应。这种情况希望引起有关部门注意。
    生产汽车用的钢材，需要有特殊的技术要求，这主要是由设计上、工艺上和设备上的要求所决定的。我在这里举几个例子说明一下。
    汽车零件中有一百零二种锻件毛胚。这些锻件用的钢材，大都是热轧优质炭素结构钢和合金结构钢。就拿40号优质炭素结构钢来说，它是用来制造汽缸体中的连杆的。连杆的作用是在汽缸体中连接活塞和曲轴，往复地传递能量。这个零件必须具有很高的强度和良好的耐劳性。如果用的钢材质量不好，就会损坏、折断，以至打坏整个发动机。因此，制造这个零件的钢材，就有了特殊的技术要求。
    有些锻件是用钢材在平锻机上制造的。它们要求钢材尺寸精确。这是因为平锻机上制造零件的阳阴模的尺寸和容积早已固定，卡具的大小也早已固定。假若钢材尺寸稍大，就会造成飞边折叠等废品，甚至卡死材料和模腔，造成平锻机损坏事故。假如钢材尺寸稍小，卡模就夹不紧，锻造时发生跳动，也会造成废品。这种尺寸精确的要求，是由汽车生产的工艺设备和流水生产的特点所决定的。过去，在签订试制合同的时候，汽车厂的同志有时候没有把这种情况详细交代清楚，以致有些冶金厂的同志不愿意接受这种要求。但是，有时候驻汽车厂的苏联专家到冶金厂详细说明以后，有的冶金厂还是托词拒不接受这种要求。这种情况，我们认为是不好的。
    汽车车身翼翅板、挡泥板等零件的原材料，都是冷轧和热轧钢板。这种钢板，必须具有良好的深冲压性能。在汽车厂调整生产的时候，曾经拿苏联生产的钢板和我国试制的钢板同时进行试验。前者放在冲压设备上冷冲以后，就成了表面光滑的、无裂缝的合格零件，后者冷冲后就裂缝了。经过实际试验，冶金厂派来的技术人员，也认识到汽车厂提出的钢板的特殊技术要求是必要的。
    总之，生产质量优良的国产汽车所需要的钢材，决不能同一般钢材相比。为了生产质量优良的汽车，第一汽车制造厂需要努力学习，同时也就需要国内各个协作厂和冶金厂共同努力。钢材是汽车生产的重要原材料，同汽车的质量、成本息息相关。所以，汽车的生产，实际上是机械工业和冶金工业的结晶，需要两方面共同努力。汽车工业常常会向冶金工业提出改进技术、提高钢材质量的要求，这不是技术上的争论问题，而是汽车生产的实际需要。
      目前，我国冶金工业确实还不能满足我国汽车工业的需要，这是一个实际存在的矛盾。我们相信，冶金工业部门的同志们决不会让我们汽车制造厂的流水生产长期依靠国外供应钢材。我们希望国内冶金厂积极采取措施，生产出更多更好的钢材，源源不断地供应汽车生产的需要。
