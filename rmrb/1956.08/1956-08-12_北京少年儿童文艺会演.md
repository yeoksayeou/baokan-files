Xinhua News Agency, 9th. At the Beijing Children's and Young People's Art Performance, which concluded on the 9th, the recitation "Ten Years Later, I'll See You Again" by fifteen-year-old girl Kan Shuzhen, was awarded an Outstanding Creation Prize. In this work, the author, with abundant emotion and rich imagination, imagines what her friends will be like ten years later—engineers, writers, tractor drivers...
    More than 1,470 children and young people participated in this performance, performing more than 100 programs of singing, dancing, drama, acrobatics, etc., of which more than 20 programs won outstanding awards.
    The artistic talents of the children and young people left a deep impression on the audience and listeners. Nine-year-old Liu Jiahu recited the story of "Female Labor Model Xu Xiufang," her voice and movements like those of a rural girl. Nine-year-old pianist Zhu Zhu also successfully performed the pieces "Galloping Horse" and "Hide-and-Seek" composed by Ma Sicong and Ding Shande.
    This performance was jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Beijing Municipal Mass Art Center, and the Beijing Children's Palace.

    北京少年儿童文艺会演
    新华社9日讯　在九日结束的北京市少年儿童文艺会演上，十五岁的小姑娘阚树珍作的朗诵词“十年以后我再见到你”，被评为优秀创作奖。作者在这篇作品中，以充沛的感情和丰富的想像，设想十年以后她的朋友们会变成什么样子——工程师、文学家、拖拉机手……。
    参加这次会演的有一千四百七十多个少年儿童，演出了歌唱、舞蹈、戏剧、杂技等一百多个节目，其中有二十多个节目得了优秀奖。
    少年儿童们的艺术才能给观众和听众留下了深刻的印象。九岁的刘嘉惠朗诵了“女劳动模范徐秀芳”的故事，她的声音和动作好像一个农村姑娘。九岁的小钢琴家朱珠也成功地演奏了马思聪、丁善德作的曲子“走马”和“捉迷藏”。
    这次会演是由北京市教育局、青年团北京市委员会、北京市群众艺术馆、北京市少年宫联合举办的。
