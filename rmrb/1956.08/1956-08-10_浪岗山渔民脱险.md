    Fishermen of Langgang Mountain Rescued from Danger
    According to Xinhua News Agency, one hundred and sixty-three fishermen, who were trapped by a typhoon on Langgang Mountain in Putuo County, were rescued by a motorized sailboat sent by a unit of the People's Liberation Army and the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee on the 6th. There were no casualties.
    Langgang Mountain is an isolated island on the easternmost side of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province. When the typhoon struck, the fishermen who were fishing there were unable to return to Putuo in time due to the distance. After learning of this, the CPC Putuo County Committee and the County People's Committee immediately reported to higher authorities for assistance. The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Zhoushan Prefectural Committee immediately organized a rescue effort. The Provincial Committee issued a call through the Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station, notifying the fishermen trapped on Langgang Mountain to find ways to protect themselves and wait for rescue. After receiving the typhoon warning from the radio, the fishermen on Langgang Mountain immediately moved the thatched sheds at the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain and tried to reinforce them. Small boats were also moved up the mountain. On the night of the 1st, a powerful typhoon brought torrential rain and waves over four zhang high. At this time, more than one hundred fishermen huddled together, holding onto the ropes supporting the thatched shed to support each other and survived the dangerous days.
    At 2:30 a.m. on the 6th, the rescue ship approached Langgang Mountain. The cadres on the ship delivered one thousand catties of biscuits and a box of cigarettes to the fishermen. A doctor also came along to treat the fishermen. The fishermen were extremely happy. They held the cadres' hands tightly and insisted on giving the cadres their homemade wine.
    The fishermen's small boats on Langgang Mountain were not damaged. On the afternoon of the 6th, they went back to the sea to harvest mussels.

    浪岗山渔民脱险
    据新华社讯　被台风围困在普陀县浪岗山的一百六十三个渔民，六日由人民解放军某部和中共舟山地委派出的机帆船抢救出险，无一伤亡。
    浪岗山是浙江省舟山群岛最东边的一个孤立小岛，当台风袭来的时候，在那里捕鱼的渔民因为路远，不及赶回普陀。中共普陀县委和县人民委员会知道后，立即向上级报告求援。中共浙江省委和舟山地委马上组织抢救。省委通过浙江人民广播电台发出呼号，通知被围困在浪岗山的渔民设法保护自己，坚持待援。在浪岗山的渔民从收音机中收到台风警报后，马上把在山脚下的草棚搬到山上，并且设法加固。小船也搬运上山。一日晚，强大台风带着暴雨，掀起了四丈多高的海浪。这时，一百多个渔民紧紧拥抱在一起，互相拉住支持草棚的绳子，坚持地度过了惊险的日子。
    六日早上二点半钟，出发救援的船只驶近了浪岗山。船上的干部为渔民们送去了一千斤饼干和一箱香烟。还有一名医师也随同前来为渔民治病。渔民们高兴极了。他们紧紧地拉住干部们的手，并且一定要把自己的老酒送给干部喝。
    浪岗山上渔民的小船没有受到损失。六日下午，他们又下海采淡菜了。
