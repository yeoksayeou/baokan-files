Xinhua News Agency, 12th - The State Council issued a notice on August 9th regarding the implementation of private subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals needed for private reading in state organs, organizations, troops, enterprises, and schools.

The notice stipulates that, starting October 1, 1956, all newspapers and periodicals read privately in organs, organizations, troops, schools, and other institutions, as well as state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, not for work purposes, shall be subscribed to at personal expense, or organized for collective subscription at personal expense. However, people's committees in rural townships and newspapers for village elementary schools, newspapers ordered for collective reading by soldiers in the troops, etc., are not subject to the above restrictions. Units can unsubscribe from newspapers and periodicals already subscribed to for private reading using administrative or operating expenses beyond October 1st and return the subscription fees to the post office.

The notice stated that, in order to make this significant change in newspaper and periodical distribution work successful, it is necessary to promote and solicit individual subscriptions. Administrative leaders of each unit should, according to the specific circumstances, obtain the assistance of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations to help the postal departments establish newspaper and periodical promotion stations or newspaper and periodical promoters in organs, organizations, troops, enterprises, and schools, and assign the unit's dispatch personnel to be responsible for the distribution of privately subscribed newspapers and periodicals within the unit. In the work of newspaper and periodical promotion, it is also necessary to prevent any coercive methods.

    国家机关、团体、部队、企业、学校中
    十月一日起私人自费订阅报刊
    新华社12日讯　国务院在八月九日发出关于国家机关、团体、部队、企业、学校中私人需要的报刊实行自费订阅的通知。
    这个通知规定，从1956年10月1日起，所有机关、团体、部队、学校以及其他事业单位和国营、公私合营企业单位中非因工作需要私人阅读的报刊，一律由本人自费订阅，或者组织起来集体自费订阅。但乡人民委员会和乡村小学的报刊，部队订给战士集体阅读的报刊等等，都不受上述限制。各单位对于已经用行政费或事业费订给私人阅读的十月一日以后的报刊，可向邮局退订并退回订款。
    通知说，为了作好报刊发行工作中这个重大的变革，必须展开个人订阅的推广和收订工作。各单位行政领导应该根据具体情况，取得党、团和工会组织的协助，帮助邮电部门在机关、团体、部队、企业、学校中设立报刊推广站或报刊推广员，并且责成机关的收发人员负责机关内私人所订报刊的分发工作。在报刊推广工作中，还必须防止任何强迫命令的办法。
