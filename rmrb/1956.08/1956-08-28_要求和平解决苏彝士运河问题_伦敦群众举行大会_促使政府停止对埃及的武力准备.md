Xinhua News Agency, London, 27th - A mass meeting was held in Hyde Park, London, on the afternoon of August 26th, passing a resolution calling for a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal issue. The meeting was convened by the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

The resolution of the meeting stated that the citizens of London strongly condemned the government's war policy on the Suez Canal issue, which "threatens the interests of the British people and endangers peace."

"The British people will never tolerate the restoration of imperialist control over the Suez Canal by force under the guise of 'internationalization'."

"We declare that it is possible to find a fair and reasonable solution that respects Egyptian national sovereignty and safeguards the interests of all countries using the canal.

"We demand: Immediate convening of Parliament;

Halting preparations for the use of force against Egypt;

Peaceful resolution through consultation based on the proposals put forward by the Indian government."

The resolution was immediately delivered to 10 Downing Street after the meeting by a six-person delegation led by Gollan. After the meeting, demonstrators held a march.

Despite the rain, thousands of people stood on the grass in the park, intently listening to speeches by John Gollan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and Betty Matthews, Organizing Secretary of the London District Committee.

In his speech, Gollan said that the Western countries were handing Egypt an ultimatum that they knew Egypt could not accept. He said that the British people's protests against armed action had averted the danger of war at the beginning of the crisis, but "now more resolute protests are needed because the situation is now more dangerous."

He said: The Conservatives are now refusing to convene Parliament before the ultimatum is delivered to Egypt and before an extremely serious situation arises. They even hope to create further excuses for intervention by inciting canal pilots not to return to work. Gollan said, "Parliament must now meet and force the government to be genuinely willing to negotiate. That means abandoning the ultimatum, rescinding military measures, and convening a new, broader conference with Egypt participating to negotiate a genuine solution that is acceptable to all parties."

Gollan said that seizing control of the canal from Egypt, as the British government is currently planning, would certainly jeopardize British interests. He said that the real guarantee of free passage of British ships through the canal and continued oil supplies is to seek a just solution through negotiation.

    要求和平解决苏彝士运河问题
    伦敦群众举行大会
    促使政府停止对埃及的武力准备
    新华社伦敦27日电　8月26日下午在伦敦海德公园举行了一次群众大会，会上通过了决议，要求和平解决苏彝士运河问题。这次大会是由英国共产党伦敦区委员会召开的。
    大会的决议说，伦敦市民强烈谴责政府在苏彝士运河问题上采取的战争政策，这种政策“威胁了英国人民的利益，并且危害了和平”。
    “英国人民决不容忍在‘国际化’的伪装下以武力恢复对苏彝士运河的帝国主义控制。”
    “我们宣布，找到尊重埃及民族主权和保障使用运河的各国利益的公平合理的解决办法是可能的。
    “我们要求：立即召开议会；
    停止对埃及使用武力的准备工作；
    根据印度政府提出的建议协商和平解决。”
    决议由以高兰为首的六人代表团在大会结束后立即送交唐宁街十号。在大会结束后，示威者举行了游行。
    尽管下雨，成千的人站在公园的草地上，全神贯注地听取英国共产党总书记高兰和伦敦区委员会组织部长贝蒂·马修斯的演说。
    高兰在演说中说，西方国家正在把它们事先知道埃及不可能接受的最后通牒交给埃及。他说，英国人民反对武装行动的抗议避免了在危机开始时的战争危险，但是“现在需要更加坚决的抗议，因为现在的局势更加危险了”。
    他说：保守党现在拒绝在最后通牒交给埃及并且在极度严重的局势产生以前召开议会。他们甚至希望，用鼓动运河领航员不回到工作岗位的办法来为干涉制造进一步的借口。高兰说，“现在议会必须开会，迫使政府真正愿意进行谈判。那就是说，放弃最后通牒，撤销军事措施，召开有埃及参加的新的更广泛的会议，谈判谋求一个为各方面都能够接受的真正的解决办法。”
    高兰说，像现在英国政府计划的那样从埃及手里夺走对运河的控制权，一定会断送英国的利益。他说，英国船只自由通行运河和继续得到石油供应的真正保证是通过谈判谋求公正的解决办法。
