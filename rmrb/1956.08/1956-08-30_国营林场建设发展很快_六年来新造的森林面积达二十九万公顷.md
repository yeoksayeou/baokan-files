    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The construction of state-owned forest farms nationwide has made great progress. According to statistics from a recent symposium on state-owned forest farms, 355 new state-owned forest farms have been established nationwide since liberation. Together with the existing forest farms, there are currently 418 across the country. In the past six years, these forest farms have newly planted 290,000 hectares of forest, a figure close to the total afforestation area during the decades of Kuomintang reactionary rule. Moreover, the afforestation area of state-owned forest farms since liberation is equivalent to 60% of the total state-owned afforestation area.
    Significant achievements have also been made in nurturing and protecting existing forests. State-owned forest farms in many provinces and regions have adopted measures such as opening firebreaks, organizing forest protection teams, and actively carrying out prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, as well as tending and regenerating residual forests. Because state-owned forest farms in various localities generally have mastered afforestation techniques and paid attention to land preparation before afforestation and nurturing after afforestation, the quality of afforestation and survival rate have been increasing year by year. For example, in nine state-owned forest farms in Jiande, Changhua, Lishui, Xihu, and Yuhang in Zhejiang Province, the average survival rate of afforestation has increased from 78% in 1954 to 92% in 1956.
    After research, the symposium also emphasized that the current shortcomings in the work of state-owned forest farms include insufficiently clear management policies, poor management, and neglect of forest land survey and design work. Therefore, the conference required that, based on the task of state-owned afforestation of more than 7 million hectares in twelve years, the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership, active development, and ensuring quality" must be earnestly adopted in future forest farm construction work. This will ensure the planned consolidation and improvement of existing forest farms, the active and systematic development of state-owned forests, and the corresponding development of new forest farms. At the same time, it is also necessary to comprehensively and systematically carry out seed collection, seedling cultivation, and the nurturing and protection of young and mature forests, and to carry out different production management tasks on time according to the growth process of the forest. The conference also made a detailed study of the specific issues of future forest farm construction and put forward opinions.
    This conference was convened by the Ministry of Forestry and lasted for ten days.

    国营林场建设发展很快
    六年来新造的森林面积达二十九万公顷
    据新华社讯　全国国营林场建设工作获得很大发展。据最近结束的国营林场座谈会统计，全国解放以来新建立的国营林场有三百五十五个，连同旧有的林场目前全国共有四百十八个。这些林场六年来新造的森林面积达二十九万公顷，这个数字接近于国民党反动统治数十年间全部造林面积的总和；而解放以来国营林场的造林面积又相等于国营造林面积的60％。
    在抚育和保护现有森林方面，取得的成绩也很大。许多省、区的国营林场都采取开辟防火道、组织护林队并积极开展森林虫害的防治和残林的抚育更新工作。由于各地国营林场一般都掌握了造林技术，并且注意了造林前的整地工作和造林后的抚育，因此，造林质量和成活率都逐年提高，如浙江省建德、昌化、丽水、西湖、余杭等九个国营林场，三年来造林的平均成活率由1954年的78％上升到1956年的92％。
    座谈会在经过研究以后，还强调指出当前国营林场工作中存在着经营方针不够明确、经营管理不善和忽视林地调查设计工作等缺点，因此，会议要求根据十二年国营造林七百多万公顷的任务，在今后林场建设工作中必须切实采取“全面规划，加强领导，积极发展，保证质量”的方针，以便有计划地巩固提高现有林场，积极而有步骤地发展国营林，相应地发展新林场；同时还要全面系统地进行采种、育苗和幼林、成林的抚育、保护工作，按照森林的生长过程，按时进行不同的生产管理工作。会议对今后林场建设的具体问题也作了详细研究并提出了意见。
    这个会议是林业部召开的，共历时十天。
