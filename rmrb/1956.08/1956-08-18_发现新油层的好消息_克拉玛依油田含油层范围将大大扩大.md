Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, August 17th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yi Xiao, Han Wenhui): Ten structural shallow wells in the northern part of the Karamay Oilfield and the Urho area have drilled out crude oil and oil sand. These were drilled by the field geological exploration team during structural shallow drilling. The oil production from the structural shallow wells in the Urho area has attracted great attention from geologists. The Karamay Drilling Department has decided to send a well testing team to Urho for well testing.

The chief geologist of Karamay said to reporters that the geological shallow drilling team has discovered a new oil layer for the Karamay and Urho oilfields. These structural shallow wells have drilled out crude oil from another geological age - the Cretaceous period - of the Karamay Oilfield. This oil layer and the currently producing oil layer of Karamay are from two different geological periods. The phenomenon of oil production from these shallow wells distributed in the vast area from Karamay to Urho proves that the Cretaceous strata in this area may also be an oil-bearing layer with industrial value, which will greatly expand the oil layer range of the Karamay Oilfield. The geological engineer also said that based on the data obtained from the Urho shallow well drilling and seismic measurements, the geological environment here is similar to that of Karamay, so the old strata below the Cretaceous in this area will also have good oil-bearing layers like Karamay.

    发现新油层的好消息
    克拉玛依油田含油层范围将大大扩大
    新华社克拉玛依17日电　新华社记者伊晓、韩文慧报道：克拉玛依油田北部和乌尔禾一带有十口构造浅井钻出原油和油砂。这是野外地质勘探队在进行构造浅钻时钻出来的。乌尔禾地区的构造浅井出油后，引起了地质家们的极大重视。克拉玛依钻探处已经决定派出一个试油队到乌尔禾去试油。
    克拉玛依总地质工程师对记者说，地质浅钻队给克拉玛依和乌尔禾油田发现了一个新油层。这些构造浅井是从克拉玛依油田另一个地层年代——白垩纪钻出了原油的。这个油层和克拉玛依现在已经喷油的油层是两个不同年代的地层。这些分布在克拉玛依至乌尔禾广大地区的浅井出油的现象，证明这个地区的白垩纪地层也可能是有工业价值的含油层，这将使克拉玛依油田的油层范围大大扩大。地质工程师还说，从乌尔禾浅井钻探中和地震测量所获得的资料来看，这里地质生成的环境和克拉玛依相似，因而这里白垩纪以下的老地层也将和克拉玛依一样，会有很好的含油层。
