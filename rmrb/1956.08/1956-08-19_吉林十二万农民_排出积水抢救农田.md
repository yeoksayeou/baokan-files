Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 18th: Farmers along the rivers in Jilin Province are actively draining water to save farmland. The number of farmers participating in drainage has reached 120,000. With the decline of river water levels and the completion of large and small drainage ditches, drainage work in various places is progressing rapidly. After seven days and nights of drainage and rescue, Kaitong County has drained the water from half of its flooded cultivated land. At present, most of the more than 500,000 hectares of cultivated land flooded in the province have been drained. Farmers are straightening up crops, strengthening field management, and planting late autumn crops. It is estimated that after this period of rescue, the harvest from the submerged cultivated land will be about 220,000 hectares, with yields ranging from 80% to 60% of a normal year.

While draining water, disaster-stricken counties have also distributed funds and grain for the resettlement and relief of disaster victims.

    吉林十二万农民
    排出积水抢救农田
    新华社长春18日电　吉林省江河沿岸的农民积极排水抢救农田，参加排水的农民已有十二万人。随着江河水位的下落和大小排水沟的建成，各地排水工作进展很快。开通县经过七昼夜的排水抢救，已把受水淹的一半耕地排出了积水。现在，全省被洪水淹的五十多万公顷耕地，绝大部分都排出了积水。农民正在扶直庄稼，加强田间管理和种晚秋作物。据估计：经过这一期间抢救后，被淹耕地收成能在八成年景到六成年景的约二十二万公顷左右。
    灾区各县在排水同时，都发放了款项、粮食作为安置与救济灾民之用。
