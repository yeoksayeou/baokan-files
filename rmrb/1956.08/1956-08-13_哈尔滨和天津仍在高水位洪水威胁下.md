Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 12th: Due to continuous rainfall in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, the water level at 7:00 AM today was 119.72 meters. The water surface is generally two meters higher than the industrial and commercial areas of Daoli and Daowai districts, and more than three meters higher than low-lying areas. The dikes surrounding the city, having been soaked in floodwaters for a long time, are extremely vulnerable to being eroded and breached by the floods, making the city's flood control efforts a protracted and arduous struggle.

The seventeen-kilometer-long dike widening and reinforcement project, involving more than 50,000 soldiers and civilians, has already begun. This project is expected to be completed by August 13th, raising the entire dike 1.70 meters above the current water level.

Currently, although Harbin is under the threat of high water level floods every moment, the people are calm, the streets are bustling, and the market is as prosperous as usual.

At present, some cadres and citizens in Harbin have complacency, slackness, and relaxation in their flood control work. The city's flood control headquarters and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are stepping up publicity and education efforts.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 12th: The first flood peak of the rivers in North China has passed Tianjin, and the water level in Tianjin continues to decline. However, the water levels at the Sixth Fort in the western suburbs of Tianjin and at the Beiyang Bridge and Xihe Bridge in the city are still above the warning level.

    哈尔滨和天津仍在高水位洪水威胁下
    据新华社哈尔滨12日电　松花江上游连日降雨，今天上午七时的水位又是一一九点七二公尺，水面一般高出道里、道外工商业区达二公尺，水面高出低洼地区达三公尺以上。环绕市区的大堤长期浸润在洪水中，极易被洪水冲蚀洞穿成险，全市防汛斗争已进入相当持久、艰巨的阶段。
    五万多军、民参加的十七公里长的大堤加宽加固工程已经动工，这项工程在八月十三日可完工，使全部堤坝高出目前水位一公尺七十公分。
    现在，哈尔滨市虽然每时每刻处于高水位洪水威胁下，但是人心安定，街道熙熙攘攘，市场繁荣如常。
    目前哈尔滨有些干部和市民对防汛工作有自满、麻痹松劲情绪，市防汛指挥部和中共哈尔滨市委员会正加紧宣传教育工作。
    据新华社天津12日电　华北各河的首次洪峰已过天津，天津水位继续下降。但是，天津西郊的第六堡和市内的北洋桥、西河桥的水位，仍在警戒水位以上。
