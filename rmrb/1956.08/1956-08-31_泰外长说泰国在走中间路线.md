Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 30th: According to Bangkok newspapers, Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip said to the press on August 24th that many people say Thailand insists on standing on the side of Western countries, but that is not the case. Thailand is also following a middle road, but it is not neutral. Naradhip also stated that the Thai government attaches great importance to the evolution of Laos' foreign policy.

He said that Thailand has its own independent and autonomous foreign policy and does not follow Western countries blindly. He emphasized that although Thailand is a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, "Thailand needs peace. We are a small country, and what we ask for is peace. We don't need to invade anyone, but we must also defend ourselves."

In answering a question, he said: Premier Zhou Enlai is a smart and capable politician and diplomat. His attitude is friendly, and his performance in Bandung was benevolent.

When answering questions from a reporter from the "Siam Masses Daily" on August 25th, Naradhip said that countries with different political and economic systems can establish friendly relations and promote mutual understanding. But he also said that the communist system likes to use "world revolution" and "military oppression" or "aggressive harassment" to spread its ideology.

    泰外长说泰国在走中间路线
    新华社30日讯　曼谷消息：据曼谷报纸报道，泰国外交部长那拉底8月24日对报界发表谈话说，许多人说泰国坚持站在西方国家一边，其实不然，泰国也正在走中间路线，但是并不是中立。那拉底还表示泰国政府对老挝对外政策的演变十分重视。
    他说，泰国有自己的独立自主的外交政策，并不是唯西方国家的马首是瞻。他强调说，泰国虽然是东南亚条约组织的成员国，但是“泰国需要和平，我们是小国家，我们所要求的是和平，我们不需要侵略谁，但是我们也必须保卫我们自己”。
    他在答复一个问题的时候说：周恩来总理是一个聪明能干的政治家和外交家，他的态度是与人为善的，他在万隆的表现是善意的。
    那拉底在8月25日回答“暹罗群众报”记者的问题的时候说，政治和经济制度不同的国家是能够建立友好关系和促进相互了解的。但是他又说什么共产主义制度喜欢用“世界革命”和“武力压迫”或者“侵略性骚扰”来加以传播。
