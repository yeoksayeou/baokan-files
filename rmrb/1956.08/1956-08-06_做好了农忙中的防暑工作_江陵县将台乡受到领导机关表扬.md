    Having Done a Good Job in Preventing Heatstroke During the Busy Farming Season,
    Jiangtai Township, Jiangling County, Receives Commendation from Leading Authorities
    (Xinhua News Agency) Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Yifan reports: One day at noon, the reporter visited Jiangtai Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, to observe their work in preventing heatstroke. This township, due to its persistence in doing a good job in preventing heatstroke and caring for the lives of the masses during the busy farming season, has been commended by higher-level leading authorities.
    The entire township has established a total of forty-six temporary canteens to serve the busy farming season, in which members participate voluntarily and cook collectively. When members return from working in the fields, the temporary canteens immediately serve meals, striving to allow members to rest more after meals. The female members are most pleased with running the temporary canteens. In the past, they would return home from the fields, covered in sweat, and then have to start a fire to cook, in addition to taking care of children and washing clothes, leaving them no free time day or night. Now, with the temporary canteens and busy farming season childcare groups, they can reduce their labor and get appropriate rest.
    Since the beginning of the summer season, each agricultural cooperative in the township has revised its field work system to suit the summer weather. Generally, work starts earlier in the morning and ends later in the afternoon, extending the midday rest time. Physically weak and elderly or young members are assigned to do lighter work. Meetings are strictly controlled, and for urgent matters, discussions are held at the edge of the fields, with information disseminated separately. When the weather is hottest in the late morning and afternoon, cattle are not allowed to be used. Newborn Agricultural Cooperative feeders mix a small amount of gypsum and other heat-relieving and cooling medicines into the livestock's beverages.
    Due to the good work in preventing heatstroke, the labor attendance rate of members in this township has consistently remained above 95% since the beginning of summer, and production efficiency has also significantly improved, with very few cases of heatstroke and illness among people and livestock.
    The Jingzhou Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent telegram on the 1st, instructing the county committees to strengthen leadership in rural heatstroke prevention work, and promoted the experience of Jiangtai Township's heatstroke prevention work to all counties. The telegram criticized some areas for not paying enough attention to rural heatstroke prevention work, resulting in widespread cases of heatstroke and illness among people and livestock.

### 做好了农忙中的防暑工作  江陵县将台乡受到领导机关表扬

    做好了农忙中的防暑工作
    江陵县将台乡受到领导机关表扬
    据新华社讯　新华社记者曲一凡报道：一日中午，记者参观了湖北省江陵县将台乡的防暑工作。这个乡由于在农事繁忙中坚持做好防暑工作，关心群众生活，曾经受到上级领导机关的表扬。
    全乡共建立四十六个为农忙服务的临时食堂，由社员们自愿参加，集体煮饭。当社员们从田里工作回来，临时食堂马上开饭，争取使社员们饭后多休息。女社员对办临时食堂最高兴。往日她们从田间汗流浃背地回到屋里，接着就要升火煮饭，加上照顾孩子和洗衣服等杂活，日夜不得闲；现在有了临时食堂和农忙托儿组，她们就可以减轻劳动，得到适当的休息了。
    这个乡自进入暑期以来，各农业社都修订了适合夏季的田间工作制度。一般是早晨早上工，下午晚收工，延长中午的休息时间。身体弱和年老、年少的社员被分配做一些轻活。严格控制会议，有要紧事采取田边商量，分头传达的办法。在午前午后天气最热时，不准用牛。新生农业社饲养员在耕畜的饮料中，掺进少许石膏等解暑清凉的药品。
    由于防暑工作做的好，这个乡入夏以来社员的劳动出勤率始终保持在95％以上，生产效率也有显著提高，很少发生人、畜中暑生病的现象。
    中共荆州地方委员会在一日发出一个加急电报，指示各县委员会加强对农村防暑工作的领导，并且向各县推广了将台乡防暑工作的经验。电报中对于有些地方不重视农村防暑工作，以致普遍发生人、畜中暑、生病现象，提出了批评。
