    The Girl by the Grinding Machine
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    Dong Guiqing, a well-known female grinder in the chassis workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, is the first advanced producer among all grinders in the plant to reach the designed quota. She is cheerful and outgoing, always laughing and joking. She is competitive and never shows weakness. But who knows that this strong girl has also cried several times?
    That was when she had just stepped out of the gate of Dehui County Junior Normal School in Jilin Province and came to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In her life, she had only seen sewing machines in tailor shops, and she didn't know that there were so many kinds of automatic and semi-automatic precision machine tools in the world. When she first saw a machine tool that was twice as tall as herself, with dozens of knives, she was both surprised and scared. She hid behind the master worker, listening awkwardly as the master worker introduced many new terms. What is angle, what is tolerance, what is process… She didn't understand what was going on. She was assigned to be a grinder. Being a grinder who makes automobile parts is not easy. You have to operate the grinding machine that is constantly sparking and roaring, and polish the rough blank in just over a minute; you also have to carefully grasp the tolerance like embroidery, and the tolerance is finer than half a strand of hair!
    When learning a new skill, it doesn't matter if you work slower. As time passed, everyone else learned quickly, and there was a demand to speed up the implementation of assembly line production and manufacture automobile parts as soon as possible. Dong Guiqing—this stubborn girl, how could she allow herself to fall behind others? One day, assembly line production began. She stood by the grinding machine and worked for half a day, only grinding a few axle gears, but she was sweating profusely. Seeing the workers in the upper and lower processes looking at her anxiously, her grinding machine was already piled high with densely packed parts waiting to be processed. She didn't say a word, gritted her teeth, and scolded herself: "You, you're really embarrassing, why are you so slow!" After work, she hid alone where no one could see her, secretly shedding tears, thinking: "I'm learning the technology with everyone, why is everyone learning so fast, but I'm learning so slowly? Now the whole factory wants to produce cars ahead of schedule, what should I do if I fall behind alone and hold up the car production?" The more she thought about it, the more sad she became, and she couldn't help crying out loud. A worker found her crying, ran over to ask her, she quickly wiped away her tears, shook her head, and said: "It's nothing!"
    In those days, some people said: Dong Guiqing's temper has changed. Yes, why did a girl who loved to talk and laugh suddenly not talk much? Why did an innocent girl with no worries suddenly show a worried look on her face? It turned out that these days, she was troubled by an accident. The thing is like this: One day, she was eager to work faster, and hurriedly turned on the power switch, and the grinding machine roared. After a while, she suddenly heard a series of strange hissing sounds, and when she looked closely, she found that the grinding wheel was about to burst after being hit. She hurriedly stopped the machine and shouted in fright. Fortunately, she noticed it early, otherwise, if the grinding wheel flew out, she didn't know how many people would be injured. Afterwards, she checked the reason and found that she was careless and had reduced one less cut.
    This accident damaged a blank. The master worker did not harshly criticize her, but patiently helped her find the reason. She made a public self-criticism, saying that she would no longer be careless in her work in the future. For several days in a row, she couldn't sleep. She had cried holding the quilt, and she had also been discouraged and disappointed. She had read Wu Yunduo's "Dedicate Everything to the Party" and knew that the word "difficulty" could not be found in the dictionary of Communists. She felt that as long as she worked carefully, there would be no accidents. For many days, when she approached the machine tool, she silently recited: "One, two, three,..." just like some people like to recite numbers when walking. However, she recited these numbers in order to make herself work in a more orderly manner. She compiled the work before and after processing a part into sequential numbers. She thought to herself: "If I do it in order like this, there will be no mistakes." Sure enough, after working for a few days, nothing happened. As time passed, she naturally worked in order without reciting numbers. Later, she also discovered that it always took time to measure the size when processing a part, which was a waste of time. She thought of a method and made a pointer to control the size, which saved the time for measuring the size. In this way, she quickly improved her work efficiency. It used to take fifteen minutes to process an axle gear; now it only takes one minute and thirty seconds to process it. The Soviet design quota is also one minute and thirty seconds. She was the first to reach the designed quota. Her name quickly spread; her photo was posted on the honor roll.
    With the increased interest in studying technology, she also set a plan to learn the technology of all grinding machines. When she was not busy at work, she often ran to other grinding machines to see how others operated them. She asked the master worker what to pay attention to when operating other grinding machines. In just a few months, she learned how to operate five kinds of grinding machines. Soon, she was transferred to work on a finishing grinding machine. Her classmate Wang Guixia took over her original job. Wang Guixia's body was not as strong as Dong Guiqing's, and she almost dropped the parts the first time she took them. Some people said: "Wang Guixia is afraid that she can't do Dong Guiqing's job!" Dong Guiqing opposed this statement. She told Wang Guixia all her experiences in mastering this grinding machine. Wang Guixia was very careful and liked to use her brain. After working for more than a day, she learned to use Dong Guiqing's method of measuring the size. She also arranged the scattered tools neatly, as if tidying up housework, and put piles of parts in easy-to-reach places. After three days, because she shortened the time to take the parts, she processed an axle gear in one minute and fifteen seconds, breaking the quota. Dong Guiqing heard that Wang Guixia unexpectedly broke the design quota and overtook her, so she hurried over to watch Wang Guixia's operation. When she saw it, she seemed to have discovered some secret, and said loudly: "Look, Wang Guixia is stronger than me, calm and careful. Her tools and parts are placed so well!" After speaking, she quickly ran into the basement and told the comrades of the broadcasting station: "Wang Guixia has overtaken me, breaking the quota, you should broadcast it quickly!"
    Soon, Wang Guixia was transferred again, and Zheng Kun came to take over her operation on this grinding machine. Dong Guiqing and Wang Guixia helped Zheng Kun again. Zheng Kun is a girl who is willing to study hard. She learned the experience of Dong Guiqing and Wang Guixia, changed the past operating methods, and surpassed Wang Guixia, taking care of one more grinding machine.
    In more than half a year, three good girls came out next to the grinding machine that Dong Guiqing originally operated. Today, these three girls have already seen the gears made by their hands installed on domestically produced cars. They also have a common hope, which is to produce more gears and install them on the motherland's cars.

    磨床边的姑娘
    本报记者　陈迹
    第一汽车制造厂底盘车间有名的女磨工董桂清，是全厂磨工中第一个达到设计定额的先进生产者。她爱笑爱闹，心胸开朗。她好强，从不示弱。但是，谁知道这个坚强的姑娘还曾经哭过好几场呢。
    那是在她刚刚跨出吉林省德惠县初级师范学校的大门，来到第一汽车制造厂的时候。她生平只见过裁缝铺里的缝纫机，哪里知道天下还有这么多种自动的、半自动的精密机床。当她第一次看见比自己的身子还高两倍的、有着几十把刀的机床的时候，又惊奇又害怕。她躲在老师傅的背后，生疏地听着老师傅介绍许多新名词。什么角度呀，公差呀，工序呀……听不懂是怎么回事。她被分配做磨工。做个制造汽车零件的磨工，可不简单。要操纵时时冒出火花的呼呼响的磨床，用一分多钟时间把粗粗的毛胚磨光磨亮；还要像绣花那样细心地掌握公差，公差要比半根头发丝还细啊！
    初学技术，干活慢点儿没关系。日子久了，别人都学得很快，要求快些实行流水生产，提早制造出汽车零件。董桂清——这个倔强的姑娘，怎么能允许自己走在别人后面呢？有一天，流水生产开始了。她站在磨床边，工作了半天，才磨出几个半轴齿轮，却累得满头大汗。看见上下两道工序的工人，都用焦急的眼光看她，在她磨床边已经堆满了密密层层的等待加工的零件。她不作声，咬着牙，骂自己：“你呀，真丢人，为什么这样慢！”下了班，她一个人躲在没有人看见的地方，偷偷地流泪，心里想：“我和大家一道学技术，为什么大家都学得快，我学得慢呢？现在全厂都要提前出汽车，我一个人落在后面，拖住汽车出不来，怎么办呢？”她越想越难过，忍不住放声哭泣。有个工人发现她在哭，跑过来问她，她赶忙抹抹眼泪，摇摇头，说道：“没什么！”
    那几天，有人说：董桂清的脾气变了。是呀，为什么一个爱说爱笑的姑娘忽然不大讲话？为什么一个没有心事的天真的女孩子忽然露出愁眉苦脸的样子？原来，这几天，她正在为一件事故而苦恼。事情是这样的：有一天，她急于想工作得快一些，急急忙忙扭开电门，磨床轰轰地响起来。不一会，她忽然听见一连串异样的嘶嘶声，定神一看，发现砂轮被撞的快要崩出来。她慌忙停车，吓得直叫喊。幸亏发觉早，要不然砂轮飞出来，不知道要碰伤多少人。事后她检查原因，发觉是自己粗心大意，少退了一次刀。
    这次事故，弄坏了一个毛胚，老师傅没有严厉批评她，却耐心地帮助她寻找出原因。她公开地作了检讨，表示以后工作不再马虎。一连几天，她都睡不着。她曾经抱着被子流过泪，也曾经灰心失望。她看过吴运铎的“把一切献给党”这本书，知道在共产党人的字典里找不到“困难”这个字眼。她觉得，只要细心干，就不会出事故。许多日子，她走近机床，就不出声地念着：“一，二，三，……”好像有些人走路喜欢念数字一样。可是，她念这些数字，是为了让自己工作得更有次序。她把加工一个零件的前后工作，编成有顺序的数字。她心想：“我这样有顺序地干，总不会出错吧。”果真，干了几天，没有出事。日子久了，不念数字，也自然地按着顺序工作了。后来，她又发觉，加工一个零件，总要量尺寸，这样很浪费时间。她想了个方法，弄了一个控制尺寸的指针，省掉了量尺寸的时间。这样一来，她很快地提高了工作效率。原来加工一个半轴齿轮，需要十五分钟；现在只用一分三十秒，就加工好了。苏联设计的定额也是一分三十秒。她第一个达到了设计定额。她的名字，很快地传开了；她的照片，被贴到光荣榜上。
    钻研技术的兴趣增高了，她又定出计划，要学会所有磨床的技术。在工作不忙的时候，她常跑到别的磨床旁边，看人家怎么操作。她请教老师傅，在操纵别的磨床的时候要注意些什么。只几个月的时间，她就学会了五种磨床的操作方法。不久，她被调到精加工的磨床上去工作。她的同班同学王桂霞接替了她原来的工作。王桂霞的身体不如董桂清那样结实，初次拿零件，几乎要掉到地上。有人说：“王桂霞恐怕干不了董桂清的工作吧！”董桂清反对这种说法。她把自己掌握这台磨床的体会，一五一十地告诉了王桂霞。王桂霞干活很细心，爱动脑筋。她工作一天多，就学会运用董桂清量尺寸的方法。她还像整理家务似地，把乱放的工具摆得整整齐齐，把一堆堆零件，放到顺手好拿的地方。过了三天，她因为缩短了拿零件的时间，以一分十五秒加工好一个半轴齿轮，突破了定额。董桂清听见王桂霞出人意料地突破设计定额，赶过了她，就急忙跑来，观看王桂霞的操作。她一看，好像发现了什么秘密一样，大声说道：“你们瞧，王桂霞比我强，不慌不忙，细心谨慎。她的工具和零件，放得多好啊！”说完，飞快地跑进地下室，告诉广播站的同志：“王桂霞赶过我了，突破了定额，你们快广播出去！”
    不久，王桂霞又被调开了，郑坤来接替她到这台磨床上操作。董桂清、王桂霞又帮助郑坤。郑坤是个肯钻研的姑娘。她学了董桂清和王桂霞的经验，改变了过去的操作方法，又超过王桂霞，多看管一台磨床。
    半年多的时间，在董桂清原来操作的这台磨床旁，出了三个好姑娘。今天，这三个姑娘，已经看见她们双手制成的齿轮装到国产汽车上了。她们还有个共同的希望，就是要更多地生产一些齿轮，装在祖国的汽车上。
