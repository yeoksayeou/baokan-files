    Symposium Held by Chinese Music History Researchers
    
    (Our Newspaper) The National Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music invited music history researchers from various regions attending the National Music Week to a symposium on the 8th of this month to solicit their opinions on the Chinese Music History, which is scheduled to be completed in 1959, and to discuss specific ways to complete this task. More than 20 people attended the symposium, including Wang Mengshu, Zha Fuxi, Pan Huaisu, Sheng Jialun, Shen Zhibai, Li Chunyi, Lin Lu, Yang Dajun, Yin Falu, and Yang Yinliu.

    Li Yuanqing, Deputy Director of the National Music Research Institute, explained at the meeting the urgent need for compiling a music history. The initial draft of the Chinese Music History is planned to be completed in three years, which requires music historians from various regions to exert their strength as much as possible, and also to seek the assistance of experts in other aspects of music history. The methods of writing can be individual writing or collaboration. The content of the research is not limited to general music history, dynastic history, special history, or special research on music history, etc. There are also no restrictions on form, style, or content. He hoped that everyone would contribute to their strengths and divide the work so that the writing of ancient, modern, and contemporary music history can proceed simultaneously. Li Yuanqing also proposed that the National Music Research Institute would provide as much assistance as possible in providing materials during the writing process, and would also assist in publishing the works after completion, and also mentioned that young comrades should be encouraged to participate in music history research in the future.

    The meeting discussed the issue of historical periodization and whether the periodization of music history should be consistent with the periodization of general history; the relationship between music history and literary history, opera history, and archeology; and also talked about the importance of musical examples.

    At the meeting, everyone enthusiastically volunteered to share the research topics. Some comrades, although they have not determined specific topics, are prepared to participate in the writing of music history.

    Preliminary Completion of Music Survey in Hunan

    (Our Newspaper) The Hunan Music Interview Team, jointly formed by the National Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music and the Hunan Provincial Department of Culture, conducted a general survey in the province for 50 days from May 8th to June 25th this year, surveying a total of 44 counties. According to preliminary statistics, 451 different musical forms were contacted, with a total of 1,423 items including repeated items in various counties. There were 1,001 audio recordings, with a total length of 42 hours.

    In addition to discovering a considerable number of revolutionary songs, this survey also discovered many rare types of music. Rich artistic heritage of the ancient people is hidden in certain folk music and religious music. The interview also gained in the collection of musical scores, musical instruments and related musical literature and objects. During this survey, it was found that many types of music are no longer popular or are about to be lost. Failure to rescue them will cause irreparable losses. From the interview in Hunan Province, it can be seen that launching a general survey nationwide is an urgent and important task at present.

    In order to provide reference and observation for national music workers participating in this Music Week, the National Music Research Institute has opened a "Hunan Music Interview Work Exhibition Room" for outside visits.

    Hong Xiannv Sings Cantonese Opera A Cappella at Music Week

    (Xinhua News Agency, 11th) The famous Cantonese opera actress Hong Xiannv recently participated in the first National Music Week in Beijing and sang an excerpt from the Cantonese opera "Wang Zhaojun" - "Zhaojun Out of the塞"(composed by Ma Shizeng).

    Although this excerpt is not long, it includes "Yi Fan Long Sentence Erhuang Slow Beat," "Yi Fan Middle Beat," "Erhuang Slow Beat," "Erhuang Rolling Flower," "Cuckoo Cries," and "Frontier Ballad" and other tunes. Hong Xiannv mostly uses her natural voice when speaking, and her falsetto when dragging the tune. The combination of natural and falsetto voices is extremely clever, making the words more accurate and sonorous, clear and melodious. This singing method is called "Dragon Head and Phoenix Tail" in the Cantonese opera world.

    Hong Xiannv has many artistic talents. She is good at singing Cantonese opera, can also sing Peking opera, has interest and a certain accomplishment in Chinese and foreign music, and is good at absorbing the strengths of others to enrich herself. Many musicians participating in the first National Music Week praised Hong Xiannv's singing method. The female singer Zhou Xiaoyan told reporters: Hong Xiannv's singing method has its own unique features. She very naturally mixes and uses true and false voices, making the timbre rich and expressing the characters' emotions more internally and deeply. In June this year, when Hong Xiannv performed in Beijing, Mei Lanfang also gave her a good evaluation, and mentioned in an article that her singing uses correct pronunciation methods and is full of emotion.

    整理和发扬民族音乐遗产
    中国音乐史研究者开座谈会
    本报讯　中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所本月八日邀请出席全国音乐周的各地音乐史研究者举行座谈会，征求他们对将在1959年编写完成的中国音乐史的意见，和讨论如何完成这项任务的具体办法。出席座谈会的有汪孟舒、查阜西、潘怀素、盛家伦、沈知白、李纯一、林路、杨大钧、阴法鲁、杨荫浏等二十多人。
    民族音乐研究所副所长李元庆在会上说明了目前编写音乐史的迫切需要。中国音乐史的初稿计划在三年内编成，这需要各地音乐史家尽量发挥力量，同时也要争取有关音乐史其他方面的专家的协助。进行编写的方法可以独自编写或数人合作。研究的内容不限于音乐通史、断代史、专史、或有关音乐史的专题研究等等。形式、体例、内容也没有什么限制。他希望大家各尽所长的分工，使古代、近代和现代音乐史的写作能同时并进，李元庆并提出在编写的过程中民族音乐研究所将尽量协助供给资料，作品完成后也将尽量协助出版，并谈到今后还应当多鼓励青年同志参加音乐史的研究工作。
    会上讨论了历史分期的问题及音乐史的断代与一般通史的断代是否应取得一致的问题；音乐史与文学史、戏曲史及考古学的关系问题；同时还谈到乐曲实例的重要性问题。
    会上大家踊跃自报了愿意分担研究的题目。有的同志虽未定出具体题目，但准备参加音乐史的编写工作。
    湖南音乐的普查工作初步完成
    本报讯　由中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所和湖南省文化局联合组成的湖南音乐采访队，从今年五月八日起到六月二十五日，在该省进行了五十天的普遍调查，一共调查了四十四个县。据初步统计，接触了451种不同的音乐形式，连同各县重复的项目一共计1423项。录音节目一千零一个，全长四十二小时。
    这次普查，除了发现数量可观的革命歌曲外，还发现了许多罕见的乐种。在某些风俗音乐，宗教音乐中蕴藏着古代人民丰富的艺术遗产。在乐谱、乐器及有关音乐文献实物方面的搜集，这次采访也有收获。这次普查中，发现不少乐种已不流行或即将失传，如不进行抢救，将造成不可弥补的损失。从湖南一省的采访，可以看出在全国范围内展开普查，已是当前的一项迫切而重要的任务。
    民族音乐研究所为了供给参加此次音乐周的全国音乐工作者的参考观摩，特开辟“湖南音乐采访工作陈列室”。供外界参观。
    红线女在音乐周上清唱粤剧
    据新华社11日讯　著名粤剧演员红线女最近在北京参加第一届全国音乐周，清唱了粤剧“王昭君”中的一段选曲——“昭君出塞”（马师曾撰曲）。
    这段唱词虽然不长，却包括了“乙反长句二黄慢板”、“乙反中板”、“二黄慢板”、“二黄滚花”、“子规啼”和“塞外吟”等曲调。红线女吐字多用真嗓，拖腔转用假嗓，真假嗓音结合得极其巧妙，愈发显得字正腔圆、清脆婉转。这种唱法在粤剧界叫做“龙头凤尾”。
    红线女有着多方面的艺术才能。她擅长唱粤剧，也会唱京戏，对中、外音乐都有兴趣和一定的修养，而且善于吸取别人长处，来丰富自己。参加第一届全国音乐周的许多音乐家都赞美红线女的演唱方法。女歌唱家周小燕对记者说：红线女的唱法有着独到之处。她非常自然地把真声和假声混合运用，使音色丰富，更内在、更深刻地表达人物的情感。今年六月间，红线女在北京演出时，梅兰芳也给她很好评价，曾在一篇文章中讲到她唱腔运用着正确的发音方法，而且富有情感。
