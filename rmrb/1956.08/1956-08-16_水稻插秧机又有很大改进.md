    The first rice transplanter independently created in China performed its second field demonstration in Nanjing on the 8th. Through the arduous work of researchers, the machine's work efficiency and quality have been greatly improved compared to the first field demonstration on July 23rd. Originally, only about 70% of the seedlings separated by the transplanter met the requirements, and the missed transplanting rate was between 6% and 11.3%. During this demonstration, the number of seedlings separated reached the uniformity of manual transplanting, and the missed transplanting rate was reduced to about 3%. Due to some improvements in the land preparation method, shortcomings such as mud piling up next to the machine and floating seedlings have also been improved.

    水稻插秧机又有很大改进
    本报讯　我国首创的第一架水稻插秧机，八日这天在南京作了第二次下田表演。这架机器经过研究人员的艰苦劳动，工作效率和工作质量，比七月二十三日第一次下田表演时又有了很大的改进。原来插秧机所分秧数只有70％左右合乎要求，漏插率也在6％到11.3％，而这次表演时分的秧数已达到人工插秧的均匀度，漏插率已降低到3％左右。由于整地方法上有了些改进，机旁壅浮泥、飘棵等缺点也有了改进。
