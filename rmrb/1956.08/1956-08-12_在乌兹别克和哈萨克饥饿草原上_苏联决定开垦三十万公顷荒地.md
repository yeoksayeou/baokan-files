    In the Hungry Steppe of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan
    The Soviet Union Decides to Reclaim 300,000 Hectares of Wasteland
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th—The Hungry Steppe of Central Asia, historically known for its arid and barren land, will have another 300,000 hectares of land irrigated and reclaimed.
    A message published in Moscow newspapers today said that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted this decision after studying the proposals put forward by the Party organizations and Soviet organs of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
    This irrigation and reclamation work will be completed between 1956 and 1962. Of the total land, 200,000 hectares are in Uzbekistan and 100,000 hectares are in Kazakhstan; 280,000 hectares of land will be used to establish thirty-four state farms, and the remaining 20,000 hectares will be managed by collective farms. After these lands are cultivated, they will be able to produce at least 320,000 to 340,000 tons of seed cotton annually.
    To this end, it is planned to build an irrigation canal network in the central part of the newly reclaimed Hungry Steppe that can irrigate more than 150,000 hectares of land between 1956 and 1962, and an irrigation canal will also be built in the southern part, as well as other irrigation systems.
    At the same time, it is also planned to build a 600-kilometer-long highway trunk line and a 200-kilometer-long branch line to the center of each state farm.
    In addition, machine road construction stations, machine tractor stations, cotton ginning factories, hydroelectric power stations, high-voltage power transmission lines, substations, and railways will also be built in this area in the next two years.

    在乌兹别克和哈萨克饥饿草原上
    苏联决定开垦三十万公顷荒地
    新华社莫斯科11日电　历来以苦旱荒凉著称的中亚细亚的饥饿草原，又将有三十万公顷的土地得到灌溉和开垦。
    莫斯科各报今天刊登的一条消息说，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在研究了乌兹别克和哈萨克的党组织和苏维埃机关提出的建议以后采取了这个决定。
    这项灌溉和开垦工作将在1956年到1962年间完成。全部土地中有二十万公顷在乌兹别克，十万公顷在哈萨克；有二十八万公顷的土地将用来建立三十四个国营农场，其余两万公顷的土地将由集体农庄来经营。这些土地耕种以后，每年至少能够出产三十二万吨到三十四万吨的籽棉。
    为此，计划在1956到1962年期间，在新开垦的饥饿草原的中部建筑一个可以灌溉十五万多公顷土地的灌溉渠网，在南部也将建筑一条灌溉渠，还要建筑其它的灌溉系统。
    同时还计划建筑一条长达六百公里的公路干线，和通到各国营农场中心的共长二百公里的支线。
    此外，在最近两年内还将在这个地区建设机器筑路站、机器拖拉机站、净棉工厂、水电站、高压输电线、变电所和铁路等。
