    Twenty-one local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in Shaanxi Province reached the total output value level of the last year of the First Five-Year Plan by the end of June this year, ahead of schedule. These factories and mines account for more than a quarter of the factories and mines under the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry that are included in the Five-Year Plan. Among the 19 major products of these factories listed in the Five-Year Plan, 13 exceeded the production targets for the last year of the Five-Year Plan. The Fengqiao Brick and Tile Factory, Xinhua Brick and Tile Factory, and three other factories plan to increase production for the state by nearly 90 million bricks and 90,000 cement pipes in the year and a half from July this year to the end of next year.

    The Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 reached its 1957 labor productivity and total output value targets as early as the end of May this year. The reason why this plant was able to reach these two targets ahead of schedule is that the workers implemented more than 20 suggestions from Soviet experts in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, improved many operating methods, and changed the crude oil production process.
