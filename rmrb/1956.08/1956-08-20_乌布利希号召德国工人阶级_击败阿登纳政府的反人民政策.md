    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 19th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, on August 17th, severely condemned the Adenauer government's reactionary measures of outlawing the German Communist Party and called on the German working class to unite to defeat this anti-people policy.

    At a meeting of the Magdeburg party organization, Ulbricht said that the measure of outlawing the German Communist Party proves that the Adenauer government is trampling on the democratic rights stipulated in the constitution and also shows that Adenauer has abandoned the idea of peacefully reunifying Germany. However, his plan will fail, the German Communist Party will continue to exist, and will fight for the cause of peace, democracy and socialism.

    Ulbricht pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is reducing its army, releasing political prisoners, and broadly promoting democracy. But the Bonn government's response to these measures is to implement compulsory military service, arrest communists and other peace fighters, outlaw the German Communist Party, and persecute democratic organizations such as the German-Soviet Friendship Association.

    Ulbricht finally emphasized that in order to defend peace and end the terrorist rule of West German militarists, the German working class must unite, and there must be cooperation between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Social Democratic Party, and the East and West German trade union organizations.

    乌布利希号召德国工人阶级
    击败阿登纳政府的反人民政策
    新华社柏林19日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希八月十七日严厉谴责阿登纳政府取缔德国共产党的反动措施，并且号召德国工人阶级团结起来击败这种反人民的政策。
    乌布利希在马格德堡党组织的一次会议上说，取缔德国共产党的措施证明阿登纳政府正在践踏宪法规定的民主权利，也说明阿登纳已经抛弃了和平地重新统一德国的念头。但是，他的计划将要失败，德国共产党将继续存在，并且为和平、民主及社会主义的事业而战斗。
    乌布利希指出，德意志民主共和国裁减军队，释放政治犯，并且广泛发扬民主。而波恩政府对这些措施的回答却是：实行强迫兵役制，逮捕共产党人和其他和平战士，取缔德国共产党，并且迫害像德苏友好协会这样的民主组织。
    乌布利希最后强调指出，为了保卫和平和结束西德军国主义者的恐怖统治，德国工人阶级必须团结一致，德国统一社会党和社会民主党及东、西德工会组织之间必须合作。
