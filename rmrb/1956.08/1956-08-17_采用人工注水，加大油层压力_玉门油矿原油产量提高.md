Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, August 15th (Reporter Yao Bingjian): Yumen Oil Mine has adopted the method of injecting water into the oilfield from its edges to increase oil layer pressure and boost crude oil production, achieving good results.

In the past, some oil wells with very low crude oil production and incapable of normal self-flowing are now becoming high-yield oil wells that can continuously self-flow. For example, well No. 23 of a certain oil layer in the Laojunmiao oilfield had weak self-flowing capacity in the past, could not produce continuously, and had very low output. Since water injection, the self-flowing capacity of this oil well has increased, it can produce continuously, and the daily crude oil production has increased more than six times compared to the past. Another example is well No. 26 in the same oil layer, which could not produce oil for several days each month in the past due to insufficient pressure. After water injection, the pressure has also increased, it can produce continuously every month, and the daily crude oil production has increased by eight tons compared to the past. In addition, according to the statistics of six oil wells, the daily crude oil production has increased significantly after water injection, with the lowest increase of 25% and the highest increase of 4.4 times.

The method of injecting water artificially from the edges of the oilfield to the inside to increase oil layer pressure to exploit the oilfield is one of the world's advanced technologies for oilfield development. According to oil production experts: if only a large number of production wells are drilled in the oilfield, allowing them to self-flow for oil production, and using pumping units for oil production when they cannot self-flow, generally only 35% to 40% of the crude oil reserves in the oilfield can be extracted at most. If the artificial water injection method is adopted at the edge of the oilfield, 60% to 80% of the crude oil reserves can be extracted.

At the end of 1953, with the help of Soviet experts, Yumen Oil Mine formulated a preliminary water injection development plan based on the nature of the Laojunmiao oilfield. In 1954, it began experimenting with water injection into the oilfield. Large-scale water injection work was only launched from 1955. For this reason, Yumen Oil Mine has successively built five new water injection plants (also known as water injection stations) and drilled a large number of water injection wells at the edge of the oilfield. The planned water injection volume for the entire year this year has increased by more than double compared to 1955.

Yumen Oil Mine still has some problems in its water injection work. The reporter learned from relevant departments of Yumen Oil Mine: in the second half of 1955, due to only focusing on completing the water injection plan and neglecting balanced water injection at the edge of the oilfield, excessive water injection in the southern part of the oilfield once caused "tongue-shaped water intrusion," and a few oil wells were flooded. Since February this year, Yumen Oil Mine has taken measures to improve the situation of unbalanced water injection, but this phenomenon has not been completely eliminated. According to statistics up to the end of June, the water injection volume in the southern part of the oilfield still accounts for more than 44% of the total edge water injection volume during the same period. Therefore, if not careful, it will cause serious consequences and damage the oilfield.

### 采用人工注水，加大油层压力  玉门油矿原油产量提高

    采用人工注水，加大油层压力
    玉门油矿原油产量提高
    新华社玉门15日电　新华社记者姚秉鉴报道：玉门油矿采用在油田边缘向油田内部注水的办法来增加油层压力提高原油产量，已经收到了良好效果。
    过去一些原油产量很低而又不能正常自喷的油井，现在都成为能够连续自喷的旺油井。如老君庙油田某油层的第二十三号油井，过去自喷能力很弱，不能连续生产，产量很低。自从注水以后，这口油井的自喷能力提高了，可以连续生产，原油日产量比过去提高了六倍多。又如同一油层的第二十六号油井，过去因为压力不够，每月常常有几天不能产油，注水以后，压力也提高了，每月可以连续生产，而且原油日产量比过去增加了八吨。另外，根据六口油井的统计，注水以后原油日产量也都增加很多，最低的增产25％，最高的增产四点四倍。
    在油田边缘向油田内部采用人工注水以增加油层压力来开采油田的方法，是目前世界上开采油田的先进技术之一。据采油专家谈：在油田上只顾大量钻生产井，令其自喷采油，不能自喷的时候就用抽油机采油的方法，一般最多只能采出油田内原油储量的35％到40％。若是在油田边缘采用人工注水方法开采油田，就可以采出原油储量的60％到80％。
    玉门油矿在1953年底，在苏联专家帮助下，根据老君庙油田的性质，初步制定了注水开采的方案。1954年开始试验向油田内部注水。从1955年起才大规模地展开了注水工作。为此，玉门油矿曾经陆续新建了五座注水厂（又名注水站），在油田边缘钻凿了大批注水井。今年全年的计划注水量比1955年又增加了一倍多。
    玉门油矿目前在注水工作上还存在一些问题，记者从玉门油矿有关部门获悉：1955年下半年内，由于只顾完成注水计划，忽视在油田边缘均衡注水，曾经在油田南部一度因为注水过多，造成了“舌水边进”少数油井被水淹没。从今年二月份，玉门油矿采取措施以后，注水不均衡的情况已经有改进，但是还没有最后消除这种现象。据到六月底的统计，五个月来在油田南部的注水量仍然占同期全部边缘注水量的44％以上，因此，若不小心，将会造成重大恶果，破坏了油田。
