    Exploration and Following
    Yuwen Ren
    Learning from Soviet experience is our unwavering policy, but in the process of learning, the following has happened: When Soviet secondary schools implemented single-sex education, some of our secondary schools quickly separated as well; when Soviet secondary schools implemented co-education, some of our secondary schools quickly combined as well. Only separation and combination, combination and separation were seen, and it seemed no one knew where the effect lay.
    In the Soviet Union, there are reasons for both separation and combination. Educators have published articles discussing the advantages of separation or combination, and each side has "grounds for their arguments and speaks with reason." It is difficult to determine which is superior for the time being. However, before and after the separation or combination of male and female students in our secondary schools, how many educators have published independent opinions and convincing papers? And what experimental results can prove it?
    The reform effect of education needs to be proven by practical experience. Before practical experience proves it, separation is not necessarily more "advanced" than combination, and combination is not necessarily more "advanced" than separation. Experimenters may as well boldly walk in front, and others may as well stand still first, listen to the movement, and look at the scenery. This has nothing to do with being "backward" or "conservative," and there is even less reason to copy along when the explorers have not yet figured out the way.
    Unfortunately, there are too many such copies. Don't think that it only exists in secondary education. Universities and primary schools also have it, as well as literature and art, news and publishing, industry, health, and other fields.
    The experience of explorers is always valuable, whether successful or failed. However, the practice of copying behind the explorers is not related to serious learning. If the explorers have run into a wall before they have figured out the direction, do the followers also have to stick their heads out and hit the wall again? No one consciously does this kind of stupid thing. However, unconsciousness is even more terrible. When it hurts, they still feel it is "unavoidable."
    The roads in the world are made by people. The explorers who walk in the forefront for humanity are brave. However, the roads in the world have not been completed, nor is there only one road to take. Otherwise, there will be no new explorers and new roads. Followers themselves are also rising explorers. As long as they have the aspiration to be explorers, they may discover new ways of walking on the road of following. Explorers do not want others to simply follow them. Purely following down, the followed becomes an idol, and the followers become unthinking blind followers.

    探求与追随
    宇文壬
    学习苏联经验是我们坚定不移的方针，但在学习过程中，曾经发生过这样的事情：苏联的中学实行男女分校了，我们的一些中学也很快地分开了；苏联的中学实行男女合校了，我们的一些中学也很快地合起来。只见分而合，合而分，似乎谁也不知道效果在哪里。
    在苏联，分与合，各有理由，教育家们都发表过文章，论述分或合的好处，各家都“持之有故，言之成理”，暂时是很难定高下。然而，在我们的中学男女生或分或合的前后，教育家们发表了多少有独立见解的能够让人心服的论文？又有哪些实验成绩能够为之作证？
    教育事业的改革效果，需要由实际的经验来证明。在没有实际的经验证明以前，分不见得比合更“先进”，合也不见得比分更“先进”。实验者不妨大胆地走在前头，其他的就不妨先按兵不动，听听动静，看看景相，这反正与“落后”“保守”无干，更没有理由在探求者还没摸清道路时就随着照搬。
    可惜，这类照搬的事太多了，不要以为光是中等教育里才有，大学、小学里也有，文学艺术、新闻出版、工业、卫生等方面都有。
    探求者的经验永远可贵，不管是成功的或失败的。但是跟在探求者后面照搬的作法和认真地学习却不相干。如果探求者在还没摸清方向的时候碰过壁，难道追随者也必须挺着脑袋再往墙上碰一次？没有人自觉地干这种傻事情。但是，不自觉却更可怕，碰痛了，还感到是“不可避免”。
    世界上的路是人走出来的。为人类而走在最前边的探求者是勇敢的。然而，世界上的路并没走完，也不是只有一条路可走，否则再也不会有新的探求者和新的路出现了。追随者自己也是后起的探求者，只要有作探求者的志愿，就可能在追随的路上发现新的走法。探求者并不希望别人仅仅是跟着走。单纯的追下去，被追者就成了偶像，而追随者也就成为不思而行的盲从者了。
