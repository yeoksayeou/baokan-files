Border Communication Heard "Singing Bird" in the Middle of the Night
Shi Ji

Deep night. The heavy rain poured down like a deluge, and the pitch-black sky was so dark that one could not see their fingers. Terrible thunder rumbled through the deep mountain valleys. At this moment, on the border of the motherland, Chen Qing and the new soldier Wu Yuanqiang were carrying out a patrol mission. By the light of the dazzling lightning, one could occasionally see their figures laboriously moving forward.

They walked down a steep and slippery hillside and came to the edge of a large forest. Chen Qing raised his head, took a couple of breaths of cold air, and said to Wu Yuanqiang with concern, "Be careful of the slippery road and don't fall and hurt yourself." He signaled him to follow closely behind. Wu Yuanqiang replied, "Don't worry, I won't fall." With that, the two disappeared into the dense forest.

The rain grew heavier and heavier, and the storm continued to rage. The forest was filled with alarming howls, dead branches snapped and fell from the trees, and the rotting leaves on the ground gave off a pungent, musty odor.

"Enemy agents and smugglers are most likely to choose weather like this," Chen Qing said softly to Wu Yuanqiang, and, drawing on the experience of a veteran soldier, he warned, "We need to be especially careful!"

Wu Yuanqiang understood and replied, "I know, I won't be fooled!"

After leaving the forest, they arrived at the border river, and the water flowed with a rushing sound. At this moment, Chen Qing suddenly heard a "Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!" bird call from the forest on the opposite bank of the river. This sound immediately aroused his suspicion: he had never heard birds singing even on nights with good moonlight! Why would there be birds singing at this time? Had the fallen branches damaged their nests and startled them? No, if it were birds, they would be chirping chaotically, not rhythmically like this! … This veteran soldier, who had fought against the enemy on the border for several years, quickly realized that this was a signal for enemy crossing.

"Comrade Wu Yuanqiang," Chen Qing asked tentatively, "Did you hear that?"

"Strange, why would there be such a bird call now?" Wu Yuanqiang quickly replied.

Chen Qing secretly praised him. How alert for a new soldier who had only been in the army for a few months! So, the two quickly flashed into the forest and lay in ambush. Soon, the same bird call came from the forest on the opposite bank. They held their breath and listened intently.

The rain continued to fall, and the streams of water flowed like cold, icy snakes from under them. Their clothes were all soaked, and the wind was blowing incessantly, but they seemed to have lost all sense of these things. They gripped their submachine guns tightly, focusing intently on the border river.

Daybreak was approaching, but they had not seen any movement. Wu Yuanqiang said a little anxiously, "Damn it, looks like another wasted wait!" Chen Qing immediately stopped him, "What's the use of being impatient! The enemy is not a fool, they will only cross when we relax our vigilance! Now that day is breaking, we should be even more vigilant." Wu Yuanqiang suddenly felt a burning sensation on his face, regretting that he had lost his composure.

As if a long time had passed, a slight splashing sound suddenly came from the river. Slowly, it became clearer. Chen Qing put his mouth close to Wu Yuanqiang's ear and said softly, "Did you hear that? Be careful, they're coming over!" They immediately prepared for battle.

The sky was dimly lit. At the edge of the forest, two figures could be clearly seen moving into the forest, and faint giggles could be heard. "Quiet a bit," one of the men in front warned his companion, "Don't let the border patrol hear us!" But his companion said carelessly, "What are you afraid of? We're already across, let's walk boldly!"

Gradually, they approached Chen Qing. Chen Qing jumped up suddenly and shouted loudly, "Stop, put your hands up!" The sudden shout startled the two guys. As they were about to turn around and run away, they heard a stern shout from behind, "Don't move, or we'll shoot!" At this point, they obediently raised their hands.

The sky was bright. The morning sun pierced through the mountains and forests, emitting golden rays. After the heavy rain, the leaves were greener than usual. The ripening wild fruits glistened and appeared particularly lovely. Chen Qing and Wu Yuanqiang, filled with victorious joy, escorted the two prisoners through the forest path towards their station.

    边防通讯夜半闻“啼鸟”
    史基
    深夜。大雨像瓢浇样地下着，漆黑的天空伸手不见五指，恶辣辣地一片雷声在深山谷里震响。这时，在祖国的国境线上，陈清和新战士吴元强，正在执行着巡逻任务。借着耀眼的闪电的光芒，偶然可看到他们吃力地迈动脚步的身影。
    他们走下又陡又滑的山坡，来到了大树林的边缘。陈清抬起头来吸了两口冷气，用关怀的口吻对吴元强说：“小心路滑，别摔倒跌坏身体。”并向他示意，叫他紧紧地跟在自己的后面。吴元强回答说：“放心吧，不会摔倒的。”说完，两个人便消失在茂密的大树林里了。
    雨越下越大，暴风仍旧不停地刮着。树林里不断发出惊人的呼啸声，树上的枯枝卡喳卡喳地断落下来，地上腐烂的树叶发出一股刺鼻的霉烂的气息。
    “敌特和走私贩们最会给自己选择这样的天气”，陈清对吴元强轻声地说着，并凭着一个老战士的经验提示道，“须要特别加小心才行！”
    吴元强会意地回答说：“知道，决不会上当的！”
    走出树林，到了界河边，河水哗啦啦地流动着。这时，陈清突然听到从河对岸树林里发出“唧！唧！唧！”的鸟叫声。这声音立即引起了他的怀疑：就是在月色很好的夜里也没听过鸟叫啊！为什么这时候会有鸟叫呢？是被断落的树枝打坏了鸟巢而惊动着了它吗？不，假若是鸟的叫声应该是唧喳唧喳乱作一团，不会这样有节奏的！……这位在边防线上同敌人进行了几年斗争的老战士，很快就弄清了这是敌人偷渡的联络信号。
    “吴元强同志，”陈清试探着问他，“你听见了吗？”
    “奇怪，现在怎么会有这样一种鸟叫的声音呢？”吴元强迅速地回答。
    陈清暗暗地称赞他，一个入伍才几个月的新战士就这样的机警！于是，两个人就迅速地闪在树林里潜伏起来。不久，对岸树林里又发出同样的鸟叫声。他俩屏住呼吸静听着。
    雨仍旧下个不停，水流像一条条冷冰冰的长蛇似的，从他们身底下流过。衣服全湿透了，风也一个劲地吹着，但他们对这些似乎全失去了感觉，握紧着冲锋枪，聚精会神地凝视着界河。
    天眼看快要亮了，还没有见到一点动静。吴元强有点着急地说：“他妈的，又算白等啦！”陈清立即劝止他：“性急有什么用呢！敌人不是傻瓜，他要等我们放松警惕的时候才偷渡的！现在天快明了，应该更加警惕才行。”吴元强突然感到脸上一阵热烘烘的，后悔自己沉不住气了。
    仿佛又过了很久，突然从河水里传来轻微的扑通扑通的声音，慢慢地，听得更清楚了。陈清把嘴凑近吴元强的耳边，轻轻地说：“听见了吗？小心点，过来啦！”他们立刻做好了战斗准备。
    天蒙蒙亮了。在林边，可以清楚地看出两个人影向林内走动，并听到轻微的嘻笑声。“轻一点”走在前边的一个警告他的同伴说：“别叫边防巡逻兵听见啦！”但同伴却满不在意地说：“怕什么，已经过来了，大胆走吧！”
    渐渐地，他们走近陈清的跟前，陈清猛跳起来，大声喝道：“站住，举起手来！”突然的叫声，把那两个家伙吓呆了。他们正准备扭头逃跑的时候，只听得后面也厉声喊着：“别动，动就开枪！”这时，他们才乖乖地举起手来。
    天大亮了。朝阳透过了山林，射出一道道的金光。大雨之后，树叶比平时更加新绿。快熟了的野果亮晶晶地显得格外可爱，陈清和吴元强带着胜利的喜悦，押着两个俘虏，穿过林间小道，朝驻地走去。（附图片）
