Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford said today at the end of his three-day visit to Taiwan that the U.S. will continue to equip Chiang Kai-shek's troops under a massive military aid program.

Radford's announcement to reporters at Taipei's Sungshan Airport exposed his mission to Taiwan as an attempt to obstruct the Chinese people's peaceful liberation of Taiwan. After arriving in Taiwan on July 31, Radford held consecutive talks with U.S.-Chiang military leaders to discuss the U.S. military aid program for Taiwan. Radford also held two meetings with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss strengthening U.S.-Chiang military cooperation and other issues. Before his departure, Radford confirmed that Chiang Kai-shek had requested more military aid from the United States. Sources say that Radford has agreed to give the Kuomintang Air Force more equipment.

Radford is the second high-ranking U.S. military and political leader to visit Taiwan after the Chinese government proposed the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Before Radford, U.S. Vice President Nixon visited Taiwan in early July to reassure the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Nixon delivered a letter from U.S. President Eisenhower to Chiang Kai-shek expressing "firm and continued support" for the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Radford left Taiwan for Seoul today. Prior to this, Radford had visited the Philippines, Indochina, and Thailand.

    雷德福说美国将继续装备蒋军
    企图阻挠中国人民和平解放台湾
    据新华社2日讯　美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福今天在结束对台湾的三天访问时说，美国将继续根据一项庞大的军事援助计划装备蒋介石军队。
    雷德福在台北松山机场向新闻记者宣布的这件事，暴露出他到台湾访问的任务是阻挠中国人民和平解放台湾。雷德福在七月三十一日到达台湾后，曾经接连同美蒋军事首脑举行会谈，讨论美国对台湾的军事援助计划。雷德福还和蒋介石举行了两次会谈，讨论加强美蒋军事合作等问题。雷德福临行前证实，蒋介石要求美国给予更多的军事援助。有消息说，雷德福已经答应给国民党空军更多的装备。
    雷德福是中国政府提出和平解放台湾的建议以后到台湾活动的第二个美国高级军政首脑。在雷德福之前，美国副总统尼克松曾经在七月上旬到台湾安定蒋介石集团。尼克松把美国总统艾森豪威尔的表示“坚决地继续支持”蒋介石集团的一封信交给了蒋介石。
    雷德福已经在今天离开台湾去汉城。在这以前，雷德福已经访问过菲律宾、印度支那和泰国。
