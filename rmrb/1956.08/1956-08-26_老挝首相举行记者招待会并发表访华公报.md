Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma told Chinese and foreign reporters here tonight that the Lao Kingdom government's declaration to resolutely implement a policy of peace and neutrality, and not to allow the establishment of any foreign military bases on its territory except as stipulated by the Geneva Accords, is fully in line with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma declared that Laos does not accept the so-called "protection" given by the Manila military bloc. He said, "We do not accept it because it is a clause related to us that was decided without our participation. Moreover, according to the Geneva Accords, we did not participate in this treaty."

Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma then said that after visiting China, he was preparing to visit Hanoi, and then go to France to report the results of his visit to China to the King of Laos. He said he was also preparing to go to Saigon to negotiate with the South Vietnamese authorities.

The Prime Minister explained that the Lao Kingdom government is willing to establish friendly relations with all its neighbors, and to respect each other on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru.

In response to a question about "US aid," he said, "We accept economic assistance from the United States, just as we accept economic assistance from China, Britain, India, Australia, Canada, and other countries."

In response to a question about developing economic relations between China and Laos, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said: "The Chinese government has suggested providing economic assistance to our country. We are very touched and have invited the Chinese government to send people to Laos to study the actual situation and consider assisting in our country's five-year plan." He went on to say that Laos' five-year plan is primarily to develop agriculture to ensure domestic food self-sufficiency, and on the other hand, to conduct exploration and exploitation to develop the country's rich resources. Laos will also develop education and eliminate illiteracy.

Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said that according to the recent agreement reached between the Lao Kingdom government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, "the Lao people can henceforth achieve national unity and devote all their efforts to developing the national economy, consolidating independence and sovereignty."

A reporter asked about the first clause of the joint statement regarding the Lao Kingdom government's adherence to a policy of peace and neutrality. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma replied that this clause describes the Lao government's established policy. As for the Chinese government, it is completely free to determine its own policy. He also said that since China has jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with India, he believes that on the basis of the Five Principles, the Chinese government will agree with and support Laos' position of strictly adhering to peace and neutrality.

Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma talked about his most profound impression during his visit to China, which was seeing the great efforts made by the Chinese people to industrialize their country. He said, "Everyone is working for the collective good, and all of this touched me very much."

Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma also read out the communiqué of the Lao Kingdom government delegation's visit to China at the meeting.

    老挝首相举行记者招待会并发表访华公报
    新华社25日讯　老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王今晚在这里向中外记者说，老挝王国政府声明坚决执行和平中立政策，并且除日内瓦协议规定的以外，不允许在它的领土上建立任何外国军事基地，是完全符合日内瓦协议的规定的。
    梭发那·富马亲王声明老挝不接受马尼拉军事集团给予的所谓“保护”，他说，“我们不接受它，因为它是在我们没有参加的情况下决定的与我们有关的条款。而且我们根据日内瓦协议，没有参加这个条约。”
    梭发那·富马首相接着说，在访问中国之后，他准备到河内去进行访问，然后到法国去向老挝国王报告访华结果。他说他还准备到西贡去同南越当局进行谈判。
    首相解释说，老挝王国政府愿意同所有邻邦建立友好关系，并且在周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理共同倡议的五项原则的基础上彼此尊重。
    在回答关于“美援”的问题时，他说，我们接受美国的经济援助，正如同接受中国、英国、印度、澳大利亚、加拿大和其他国家的经济援助一样。
    在回答关于发展中国和老挝两国经济关系的问题时，梭发那·富马亲王说：“中国政府建议给予我国经济援助，我们很受感动，并且已经邀请中国政府派人到老挝去研究实际的情况，来考虑协助我国五年计划的进行。”他接着谈到老挝的五年计划首先是发展农业，以保证国内粮食的自给，另一方面将要进行勘探和开采，开发国内丰富的资源。老挝还要发展教育事业，扫除文盲。
    梭发那·富马亲王说，根据老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队最近达成的协议，“老挝人民从此可以实现民族团结，全力发展国民经济、巩固独立和主权。”
    有记者问到联合声明中双方协议的第一款关于老挝王国政府坚守和平中立政策。梭发那·富马亲王回答说，这一款是说明老挝政府既定的政策，至于中国政府，它完全有自由决定它自己的政策。他又说，既然中国已经同印度共同倡导了和平共处的五项原则，他相信在五项原则的基础上，中国政府是会赞同和支持老挝的严守和平中立的立场的。
    梭发那·富马首相谈到在访问中国期间最深刻的印象，是看到中国人民为了使自己国家工业化所从事的巨大努力。他说，“每一个人为集体利益而努力，这一切使我很感动。”
    梭发那·富马亲王在会上还宣读了老挝王国政府代表团访问中国的公报。
