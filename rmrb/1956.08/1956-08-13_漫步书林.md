    Strolling Through the Book Forest
    Kuang Fan's "Complete Illustrated Book for the Convenience of the People"
    Xidi
    This book is very useful, but rarely seen. Qian Zeng's "Record of Diligent Study and Quick Understanding" states: "It is unknown who compiled the 'Complete Illustrated Book for the Convenience of the People.' It was carved in the summer of Hongzhi Renxu (1502 AD). The first two volumes list agricultural affairs and women's needlework. Everything that is convenient for the people is listed. Those in positions of authority can observe it along with the 'Airs of Bin' illustrations." Zhang Yu said: "The History of the Ming Dynasty, Arts and Literature: Kuang Fan's 'Complete Illustrated Book for the Convenience of the People' in sixteen volumes, under the category of agricultural books. There is no doubt that this book was written by Fan. The Tongzhi Suzhou Prefecture Gazetteer, Famous Officials: Fan, with the courtesy name Tingrui, was from Renqiu and a Jinshi graduate. In the seventh year of Hongzhi (1495 AD), he served as the magistrate of Wu County and was known for his outstanding governance." (Volume Three of the "Record of Diligent Study and Quick Understanding, Collated and Annotated"). The "Complete Illustrated Book for the Convenience of the People" from the Ming Wanli Guiyi (1593 AD) edition that I own, says in Yu Yongqing's preface: "Kuang Tingrui's 'Complete Illustrated Book for the Convenience of the People' covers everything from planting techniques and divination methods to matters of prayer, daily life regulations, animal husbandry, and minor manufacturing. It is comprehensive and focuses on clothing, food, and livelihood. Therefore, illustrations are placed at the beginning of each chapter, followed by compilations, songs, and sighs to encourage practice and acknowledge the difficulties. All daily necessities for eating and making a living are listed when the scroll is unrolled, without the need for further consultation. Isn't this what is meant by 'convenient for the people'?" The Beijing Library also has a blue-printed Jiajing Jiachen (1544 AD) edition, with prefaces by Ouyang Feng and Lu Jing, and postscripts by Huang Yudao and Wang Zhenji. However, the original Hongzhi edition has not been seen. The Jiajing edition has sixteen volumes, while the Wanli edition only has fifteen volumes. This is because Yu Yongqing's Wanli edition combined the "Agricultural Affairs" and "Women's Needlework" illustrations into one volume. The remaining categories, such as "Cultivation and Harvesting" (including hemp), "Sericulture," "Planting" (two volumes), "Miscellaneous Divination," "Monthly Divination," "Prayer and Supplication," "Auspicious Days," "Daily Life," "Health Preservation," "Animal Husbandry," and "Manufacturing" (two volumes), totaling eleven categories and fourteen volumes, are the same in both the Jiajing and Wanli editions, with no significant textual differences. However, the "Agricultural Affairs" and "Women's Needlework" illustrations in the Jiajing edition are very crude, some barely resembling human figures. The illustrations in the Wanli edition are exquisite and beautiful, with graceful postures, and are among the best woodcuts of that era. The "Agricultural Affairs" section has fifteen illustrations, and the "Women's Needlework" section has sixteen illustrations, engraved by Fu Rugang, Li Zhen, Li Yuan, Zeng Zhong, and Luo Qi, who were all excellent northern engravers of that time. This "Farming and Weaving Diagram" is believed to have originated from Lou Shu's version from the Song Dynasty. Kuang Fan wrote: "Lou Shu's old 'Farming and Weaving Diagram' from the Song Dynasty differs somewhat from the customs of Wu. Furthermore, his poems are not easily understood by ordinary farmers. Therefore, I have changed several things and added Wu songs. The matters are now easy to understand, and the language is easy to grasp. If used to advise the people, they will be encouraged to learn and may be inspired to work harder." The Wu songs he wrote are indeed smooth and easy to understand, especially since he used the "mountain song" form, which the people of Wu can sing casually. For example, "Lowering Fertilizer" says:
    Rice depends entirely on fertilizer at the roots, beancake and river mud are evenly applied.
    To gain profit, one must invest capital, the more capital, the greater the harvest. It simply and clearly explains the effectiveness of fertilization. And "Feeding Silkworms" says:
    When the silkworm's head turns white and the leaves are green, feed evenly and pick diligently.
    When they go up the mountain to become cocoons, one doesn't know how many times they've endured hardship. These can all be sung easily. The Complete Library in Four Sections mentions Lou Shu's Farming and Weaving Diagram poems but does not have the "Diagrams." The "Farming and Weaving Diagram" engravings seen today, particularly the "Agricultural Affairs" and "Women's Needlework" illustrations attached to this book, are the earliest. The first chapter of the "Cultivation and Harvesting" section clearly states the "Method for Reclaiming Wasteland": When reclaiming long-term wasteland, you must burn off the weeds, plow the land, and first plant sesame for a year. This allows the roots of the weeds to rot, and then planting grains will prevent the harm of weeds. This is because sesame acts on weeds like tin acts on five metals, they are mutually restraining. Farmers must know this. If this method proves effective, it would greatly benefit farmers who are reclaiming wasteland today. In the "Health Preservation" section, there are three prescriptions for treating "bloating" (schistosomiasis). I wonder if traditional Chinese medicine practitioners know about this and have used it. This is very important for farmers in several southern provinces, so I am recording it below: [Purple Perilla Seed Decoction] Perilla seeds (one tael), areca peel, cardamom, magnolia bark, pinellia, costus root, tangerine peel, akebia, atractylodes macrocephala, immature orange, ginseng, licorice root (half a tael each), decoct with water, add three slices of ginger and one jujube. [Guangmao Strengthening Decoction] Magnolia bark, scutellaria baicalensis, alpinia oxyphylla, amomum villosum, angelica sinensis (five qian each), coptis chinensis (six qian), pinellia (seven qian), *guangmao*, cimicifuga, safflower (stir-fried), evodia rutaecarpa (two qian each), licorice root (raw), bupleurum, alisma orientalis, medicated leaven, green tangerine peel, tangerine peel (three fen each), add kudzu (four qian) if thirsty, take seven qian per dose, decoct with three slices of ginger and drink. [Middle Energizer Dispersing Pills] Scutellaria baicalensis, immature orange (stir-fried), pinellia, coptis chinensis (stir-fried, five qian each), turmeric, atractylodes macrocephala, ginseng, licorice root, polyporus umbellatus (one qian each), poria cocos, dried ginger, amomum villosum (two qian each), magnolia bark (processed, one tael), alisma orientalis, tangerine peel (three qian each), anemarrhena asphodeloides (four qian). Grind all ingredients into powder, soak steamed buns in water, and make pills the size of tung seeds. Take one hundred pills per dose, warm them over a fire, and swallow with plain water. The entire book can be said to be suitable for the daily use of farmers, unlike "Essential Knowledge for Home Use," at least half of which is suitable for "scholars and officials." I think that although there are inevitable superstitious and taboo words, it is generally "for the convenience of the people" and should be reprinted after being整理 (zhěnglǐ, meaning put in order) for reference by experts in agricultural departments, medical and health departments, and others.

    邝璠：“便民图纂”
    西谛
    这部书很有用，但不多见。钱曾“读书敏求记”云：“便民图纂不知何人所辑。镂板于弘治壬戍（公元1502年）之夏。首列农务、女红图二卷。凡有便于民者，莫不俱列。为人上者，与豳风图等观可也”。章钰云：“明史艺文志：农家类邝璠便民图纂十六卷。是书为璠撰无疑。同治苏州府志名宦：璠字廷瑞，任丘人，进士。弘治七年（公元1495年）知吴县，循良称最。”（“敏求记校证”卷三之中）我所藏的一部明万历癸已（公元1593年）刊的“便民图纂”，于永清序上就说：“邝廷瑞氏便民图纂，自树艺占法以及祈涓之事，起居调摄之节，蒭牧之宜，微琐制造之事，捆摭该备，大要以衣食生人为本。是故绘图篇首而附纂其后，歌咏嗟叹以劝勉服习其艰难。一切日用饮食治生之具，展卷胪列，无烦咨诹。所称便民者非耶？”北京图书馆也藏有一部嘉靖甲辰（公元1544年）蓝印本，有欧阳锋、吕经二序，黄?道、王贞吉二跋。惟弘治原刊本则未见。嘉靖本为十六卷，万历本则只有十五卷。盖以万历于永清本，把农务女红二图并作一卷了。其余耕获类（麻属附）、桑蚕类、树艺类（二卷）杂占类、月占类、祈禳类、涓吉类、起居类、调摄类、牧养类及制造类（二卷）等，凡十一类十四卷，则嘉靖、万历二本皆同，文字也没有什么歧异。惟嘉靖本的农务、女红图甚为粗率，有的几乎仅具依稀的人形。万历本的插图，则精致工丽，仪态万方，是这个时代的最好的木刻画之一。“农务”凡十五图，“女红”凡十六图，出于傅汝光、李桢、李援、曾中、罗錡诸人所刻。他们都是这时代的北方刻工之良者。这个“耕织图”可信是从宋代楼璹的本子出来的。邝璠题云：“宋楼璹旧制耕织图，大抵与吴俗少异。其为诗又非愚夫愚妇之所易晓。因更易数事，系以吴歌。其事既易知，其言亦易入。用劝于民，则从厥攸好，容有所感发而兴起焉者。”他所撰的吴歌的确是平畅易晓，特别是用了“山歌”体，吴人是会随口歌之的。像“下壅”云：
    稻禾全靠粪烧根，豆饼河泥下得匀。
    要利还需着本做，多收还是本多人。于施肥的功效说得简单而明了。又像“喂蚕”云：
    蚕头初白叶初青，喂要匀调采要勤。
    到得山上成茧子，弗知几遍吃辛艰。这些，都是可以顺口歌唱出来的。楼璹写的耕织图诗四库全书总目提要曾加以著录，却没有“图”。今所见的“耕织图”的刻本，当以此书所附的“农务”“女红”二图为最早了。“耕获类”的开宗明义第一章便是“开垦荒田法”：凡开久荒田，须烧去野草，犁过，先种芝麻一年。使草木之根败烂，后种五谷，则无荒草之害。盖芝麻之于草木，若锡之于五金，性相制也。务农者不可不知。如果这个法子试之有效，则对于今天开垦荒地的农民是有很大的好处的。在“调摄类”里，有治“鼓胀”（血吸虫病）方三。不知中医们知道不知道，有没有用过。这于南方好几省的农民们关系很大，故录之如下：〔紫苏子汤〕苏子（一两）大腹皮、草果、厚朴、半夏、木香、陈皮、木通、白术、枳实、人参、甘草（各半两）水煎，姜三片、枣一枚。〔广茂溃坚汤〕厚朴、黄芩、益智草、豆蔻、当归（各五钱）黄连（六钱）半夏（七钱）广茂、升麻、红花（炒）吴茱萸（各二钱）甘草（生）柴胡、泽泻、神曲（炒）青皮、陈皮（各三分）渴者加葛根（四钱）每服七钱，生姜三片，煎服。〔中满分消丸〕黄芩、枳实（炒）半夏、黄连（炒，各五钱）姜黄、白术、人参、甘草、猪苓（各一钱）茯苓、干生姜、砂仁（各二钱）厚朴（制一两）泽泻、陈皮（各三钱）知母（四钱）共为末，水浸蒸饼，丸如桐子大。每服百丸，焙热，白汤下。这部书的全部都可以说是适合于农民们日常应用的，与“居家必用”至少有半部是为“学士大夫”们所适用的不同。我想，虽然其中不免有迷信、禁忌之语，但大体上是“便民”的，也应该在加以整理后印出，供农业部门和医药卫生部门等专家们的参考。（附图片）
