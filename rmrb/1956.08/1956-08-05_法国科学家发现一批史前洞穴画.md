Xinhua News Agency, August 4th -- According to Agence France-Presse, French scientists recently announced one of the most important discoveries of prehistoric cave paintings in history: approximately one hundred drawings of mammoths, bison, goats, horses, and rhinoceroses were found in a cave north of Dordogne, France.

    Prehistoric experts participating in the excavation of this cave said that these cave paintings have "very refined lines" and are "amazingly novel." They demonstrate a "startling realism" technique. Father Breuil, a prehistoric art authority who participated in the excavation, particularly appreciated the rhinoceros drawing. He said that this rhinoceros drawing is "the most beautiful thing in the entire Fourth Century artistic period."

    This cave is far from being fully excavated. Prehistoric experts who have participated in the excavation predict that after several years of excavation, it will prove that this discovery is a more important one, and its gains will be even richer.

    This discovery was announced at the closing meeting of the 15th French Prehistoric Congress, which was held not long ago. Representatives from fifteen countries participated in this congress.

    法国科学家发现一批史前洞穴画
    新华社4日讯　据法新社消息，法国科学家最近公布了历史上史前洞穴画的一个最重要的发现——在法国多顿涅省以北的一个洞穴里发现了约一百幅巨象、野牛、山羊、马和犀牛的图画。
    参加这个洞穴的发掘工作的史前学专家们说，这些洞穴画“线条非常洗炼”，而且“惊人地新颖”。它们表现出“惊人的现实主义”的手法。曾经参加发掘工作的史前艺术权威布吕埃尔神父特别欣赏其中的犀牛图。他说，这种犀牛图是“整个第四世纪艺术时期里最美丽的东西。”
    这个洞穴现在还远没有充分发掘。参加过发掘工作的史前学专家们预料，经过几年发掘以后，将会证明这次发现是更重要的一次发现，它的收获将会更加丰富。
    这次发现是在不久以前举行的第十五次法国史前学大会的闭幕会议上宣布的。有十五个国家的代表参加了这次大会。
