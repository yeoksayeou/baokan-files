Xinhua News Agency, Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Construction Site, August 8th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Kuihua): The large embankment project at Gongziwan on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway was completed on August 6th after three months of round-the-clock construction.

	Gongziwan, located in the midst of the continuous mountains of central Fujian Province, is one of the largest and most complex key projects on the entire Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line. Within a one-kilometer area, earth was taken from cutting down six nearby mountain peaks to fill a depression more than forty meters high to form the roadbed. The Gongziwan construction site, which used to be filled with the roar of machinery day and night, has gradually quieted down. Now, only the faint sound of blasting from distant mountains can be heard from time to time.

	During these three months, the mechanical forces on the construction site launched a labor emulation campaign. In the hot summer of the South, the temperature inside the cabs of earthmoving equipment such as scrapers and bulldozers often rose to over 40 degrees Celsius. They changed their shifts to work during the cooler hours of the morning, evening, and night, using frequent shift changes and more rest, so that the Gongziwan large embankment project was finally completed within two weeks before the track-laying train was scheduled to arrive.

### 削低山头填高洼地  鹰厦路宫子湾大填方工程完工

    削低山头填高洼地
    鹰厦路宫子湾大填方工程完工
    新华社鹰厦铁路工地8日电  新华社记者刘葵华报道：鹰厦铁路宫子湾大填方工程经过三个月的日夜施工，在八月六日完成了。
    宫子湾在福建省中部崇山峻岭之中，是鹰厦铁路全线最大而又复杂的重点工程之一。它在一公里地区内从削低附近的六座山头中取土，把洼地填高四十多公尺来修成路基。原来日夜轰鸣的宫子湾工地，渐渐地平静下来了，现在，只有远方时而传来低低的炸山爆破声。
    这三个月中，工地上的机械兵曾展开了劳动竞赛。在南方的炎夏，铲运机、推土机等筑路机械的驾驶室内的温度，经常升到摄氏四十多度。他们就改在早晚和夜间凉快的时候施工，用勤换班、多休息的办法，使宫子湾大填方工程终于在铺轨列车可以到达以前的两周内完工。
