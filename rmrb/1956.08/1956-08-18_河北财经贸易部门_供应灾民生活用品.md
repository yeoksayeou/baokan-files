Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 15th. Over the past ten days, the transportation, finance, and trade departments in the areas of Hebei Province that have been severely affected by floods have been using various methods to supply disaster-stricken people with essential living goods.

The relevant departments in various localities have been using various methods such as automobiles, horse-drawn carts, large carts, wooden rafts, livestock, and human backs to deliver essential living goods such as grain, cooked food, salt, kerosene, and matches to the disaster victims. The Handan Prefectural Highway Bureau and Transportation Company simultaneously used two vehicles on the Handan-Changzhi (Shanxi Province, Changzhi) line to transport supplies and road construction workers, repairing the road as they went. The Handan County Grain Bureau simplified the grain purchase procedures for disaster-stricken villages according to the needs of the farmers, and adopted a classified supply method, providing more flour, millet, and rice to villages severely affected by the disaster and unable to grind grain; providing cooked food to particularly severely affected disaster areas; and providing credit sales to households in difficulty. The disaster-stricken areas of Baoding, Tianjin, Tongxian and other regions organized ships to supply grain to the disaster victims on patrol; the Daming and Wei County supply and marketing cooperatives organized the urban noodle food industry to process cooked food for the disaster victims, and delivered it to the disaster victims by wooden boats and rafts. On the 7th, the Wei County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also used wooden boats and rafts to transport 1,000 jin of edible oil and 900 jin of kerosene to the farmers of Nanshakou Township.

In many areas, the supply and marketing departments, in places where transportation was not available or temporarily unavailable, cadres personally waded through the water to carry supplies to the disaster victims. Chen Zheng, director of the Gaoguanzhuang Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhuoxian County, led six salesmen to carry sixty jin of edible salt, forty jin of kerosene, and ninety packages of matches, braving the rain and wading through waist-deep water to deliver these items to Dongxiazhuang.

Because the relevant departments in various disaster areas generally ensured that "wherever the disaster victims are, grain and supplies are supplied there," they ensured that the disaster victims did not go hungry.

    河北财经贸易部门
    供应灾民生活用品
    据新华社保定15日电　近十天以来，河北省受水灾较严重地区的交通运输、财经贸易部门，运用各种办法供应灾区人民生活必需品。
    各地有关部门，利用汽车、马车、大车、木筏、牲口、人背各种办法把粮食、熟食、盐、煤油、火柴等生活必需品送到灾民手中。邯郸专区公路局和运输公司，在邯长（山西省长治）线上，同时以两辆汽车载运物资和修路工人，边走边修公路。邯郸县粮食局根据农民需要简化了灾村购粮手续，采用分类供应办法，对灾情严重不能磨面的村，多供给面粉、小米、大米；对特别严重的灾区供给熟食；对困难户进行赊销。保定、天津、通县等专区受灾地区，组织船只巡回供应灾民粮食；大名、魏县供销社，组织了城关面食业为灾民加工熟食，用木船、木筏送给灾民。魏县供销社在七日还用木船木筏给南沙口乡农民运送了食油一千斤和煤油九百斤。
    很多地区供销部门，在无法使用交通工具或一时没有交通工具的地方，干部亲自涉水把物资背送到灾民手中。涿县高官庄乡供销社主任陈政带领六个业务员背六十斤食盐、四十斤煤油，九十包火柴，冒雨趟着半腰深的水把这些物品送到东下庄。
    由于各灾区有关部门，一般作到了“灾民到那里，粮食、物资供应到那里”，保证了灾民不挨饿。
