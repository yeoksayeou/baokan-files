    Yinxian Reed Achieves Bumper Harvest
    (Our report) The nationally famous Yinxian reed has achieved a bumper harvest this year. The average yield per mu reached 1,200 jin, an increase of 41.2% compared to last year, with the highest yield reaching 1,600 jin. The planting area also increased this year, and the total output increased by 88.8% compared to last year. This year, the supply and marketing cooperatives issued many advance purchase payments and supplied 500,000 jin of fertilizer before the harvest, ensuring that the reeds were fertilized in a timely manner. In addition to the agricultural cooperatives' intensive cultivation, the reeds grew very well this year, appearing green and lush, changing the past situation of being half yellow and half green. The purchase price has also increased this year. Farmers generally reflected that this year's reeds have three advantages: good yield, good quality, and good price. As of July 20th, farmers had sold more than 800,000 jin of reeds to the supply and marketing cooperatives. (Li Qichang)
