New Rural Affairs

	Wearing Brightly Colored Clothes
	In the days following the bumper early rice harvest, the state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private cotton cloth stores along Chengguanjiang River Street in Suichuan, Jiangxi, were crowded with young women from the countryside buying floral fabrics. They hadn't dispersed even as the moon rose in the sky.
	These young women are all members of agricultural producers' cooperatives. After joining the cooperatives, they actively participated in the cooperatives' labor, just like the male members, and received the labor remuneration they deserved, giving them money to buy floral clothes. For example, female members in Heping Township received over 85 yuan each in the early rice pre-distribution, with the least receiving over 40 yuan. They said happily, "Now that we have money, we want to wear floral clothes!"
	After buying the floral fabrics, they quickly sent them to the clothing production cooperative to be sewn. Among the six thousand female members in the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in this township, excluding the elderly, more than three thousand two hundred young and middle-aged women are already wearing various kinds of floral clothes. The female members' clothes have changed from blue and white to various bright colors such as red, yellow, and green. When the wife of martyr Wang Zuo's saw her daughter-in-law and granddaughter wearing floral clothes, she burst into tears. She said: "This is what revolutionary martyrs shed blood for!"
	The female members are all beaming with joy, singing, "In the past, mountain songs were hard to sing, wearing only bean-pod colors; this year, participating in the advanced cooperative, everyone wears floral clothes."　Tang Xiaoming
	
	Old Men's Group Grows a Good Vegetable Garden
	After the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Wangzhuang Village, Chengguan Town, Pingshun County, Shanxi, transitioned to an advanced cooperative, the old, weak, sick, and disabled were worried that they would have nothing to do. Wang Changbao, a 70-year-old man, said, "When a person gets old, they are useless. They can't do heavy work, and there's not much light work to do. The elderly are finished now!"
	After the cooperative cadres discovered this problem, in order to fully utilize their production enthusiasm, they organized six or seven 60- and 70-year-old men and two semi-invalid men, Zhang Liumai and Wang Butong, into an old men's group, responsible for managing the cooperative's twelve mu vegetable garden, according to the strength of their labor.
	The old men were very happy after accepting the task of growing the vegetable garden. According to the characteristics of the land, they planted cabbage, sweet potatoes, yams, pumpkins, radishes, onions, garlic, etc. Due to the old men's hard work and careful cultivation, plus favorable rainfall, the twelve mu of vegetables grew very well. It is estimated that they can sell for 2,090 yuan, plus the money from selling more than 800 ridges of melons planted on the edges of the fields and non-cultivated land, for a total income of 2,180 yuan. This can buy 36,300 jin of grain, which is more than eight times the income from growing autumn crops. After deducting production investment, the labor value of each old man is equivalent to more than 260 yuan. They said happily: "After joining the advanced cooperative, the elderly also have something to do!"
	During the "June Sixth" festival, the cooperative distributed more than 400 jin of radishes, more than 60 jin of scallions, and some small tender melons produced in the vegetable garden to the members.　Shen Lianke

    农村新事
    穿上了鲜艳的花衣裳
    在早稻丰收后的日子里，江西遂川城泉江沿河街上的国营、合作社和公私合营棉布商店的门市部，拥满了来自农村购买花布的姑娘。直到月儿上升在天空，她们都还没有散去。
    这些姑娘，都是农业生产合作社的社员。她们在入社以后，和男社员一样，积极地参加了社的劳动，并得到了她们应得的劳动报酬，因而有钱来买花衣裳。如和平乡的女社员，她们在早稻预分中，多的分到八十五元以上，少的也有四十多元。她们乐呵呵地说：“有了钱了，要穿穿花衣服哟！”
    她们在买到花布后，就很快送到服装生产合作社去缝制。这个乡十四个农业社的六千多名女社员中，除老年人外，穿各式各样花衣服的青壮年妇女，已有三千二百多人。女社员们的衣服已由青白二色变成红、黄、绿等各种鲜艳的色彩。烈士王佐农的爱人看到媳妇、孙女穿起花衣服时，激动的流出了眼泪。她说：这是革命烈士流血换来的啊！
    女社员们个个喜笑颜开地唱着“过去山歌硬难唱，一身穿的豆角样，今年参加高级社，人人穿上花衣裳”。　汤小明
    老汉组种的好菜园
    山西平顺县城关镇王庄村光明农业社在转为高级社后，老弱病残的人都耽心自己没事干。七十岁的王长保老汉说：“人老了，不顶用，重活干不动，轻活没啥干，这下老年人可该算完了！”
    社务干部发现这一问题后，为了充分发挥他们的生产积极性，便根据劳力强弱，把六个六、七十岁的老汉和张六买、王补童两个半病号组成一个老汉组，负责经营社里的十二亩菜园。
    老汉们在接受种菜园的任务后，都非常高兴。他们根据土地的特点，分别种植了白菜、红薯、山药蛋、北瓜、水萝卜、葱、蒜等。由于老汉们的辛勤劳动，精心培育，再加上雨水匀调，十二亩菜长的都很好。预计可卖二千零九十元，再加上在地头岸边的非耕地内种植的八百余壕瓜所卖的钱，共可收入二千一百八十元。可买粮三万六千三百斤，比种秋作物收入增加八倍还多。除生产投资外，每个老汉的劳动价值，等于二百六十多元。他们高兴地说：“入了高级社，老年人也有事干啦！”
    在过“六月六”的时候，社里把菜园中出产的四百多斤水萝卜、六十多斤小葱和一部分小嫩瓜分给了社员们吃。　申联科
