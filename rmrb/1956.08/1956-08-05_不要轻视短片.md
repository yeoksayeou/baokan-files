From the Readers

    Don't Underestimate Short Films
    The domestic films "Marriage," "A Storm," and "Hasan and Jamila," among others, are all adapted from short stories. When we read the original stories, we found them delightful; but after watching the films, we felt they were greatly inferior. Why does this situation arise? I think a very important reason is that the films have been "stretched out." Since the original is a short story, its content should be more suitable for making short films. Forcibly stretching it out will make the structure seem loose and the content jumbled. Why stretch short films into feature films? Is it that some filmmakers don't attach enough importance to this concise and powerful art form?

    不要轻视短片
    国产片“结婚”、“一场风波”、“哈森与加米拉”等，都是根据短篇小说改编摄制的。我们读原著小说的时候，觉得津津有味；但看了影片，却觉得大为逊色了。为什么会产生这种情况呢？我想一个很重要的原因就是把影片“拉长”了。原著既然是短篇小说，它所包括的内容应该是更适于拍短片的。硬把它拉长，就会显得结构松散，内容杂沓了。为什么要把短片拉成长片呢？是不是某些电影工作者还不够重视这种短小精悍的艺术形式呢？
