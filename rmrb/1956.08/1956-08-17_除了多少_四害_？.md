After the "Eliminate the Four Pests" task was assigned, Resident Group Leader Sister Zhao had another job: to survey each household monthly to record the specific numbers of pests eliminated and report them to the leadership. It was said that the district was paying close attention to this. Sister Zhao had conveyed this new task to the group, but although the movement had started and everyone was diligently "eliminating," the matter of keeping count had not attracted everyone's attention. So, when she came to investigate, no one could report the numbers. Only Mrs. Chen from the second floor was attentive, remembering clearly and explaining everything.

"Mrs. Chen, how many of the four pests did you eliminate this month?" Sister Zhao asked, while holding a pen ready to record.

"Well, we killed twenty-eight flies, thirty-six mosquitoes, one rat, three sparrows..."

"Where did you catch the sparrows?" Sister Zhao asked, fearing that people would falsely report.

"Our Afu caught them in the Wang family's tree," Mrs. Chen answered, confidently.

"I didn't catch any sparrows, Mom," Afu, who was playing with cicadas nearby, declared responsibly.

"Then what were you poking at in the tree earlier?"

"Sticking cicadas! You don't understand and you're talking nonsense." Afu was unhappy with his mother because he had just been scolded for using a bamboo pole.

"No, then no!" Mrs. Chen was both embarrassed and angry. She said to Sister Zhao, "No sparrows."

"What about cockroaches?"

"Those aren't one of the four pests, I didn't record them," Mrs. Chen said righteously.

"You need to record them from now on."

It was my turn. I was very nervous. Although I deeply hated flies and mosquitoes and was merciless towards them, I had not recorded my battle results, nor was it easy to record them. Facing this questioning, I found it difficult to answer. If I said I hadn't killed any, that wouldn't be true, but not being able to give a number was the same as having no record. My wife was out shopping, and there was no one to discuss it with. Therefore, I stammered and became extremely anxious.

Just as I was in a dire situation, Mrs. Chen gave me enthusiastic help.

"Mr. You and his wife are also very active. I heard Mrs. You say," Mrs. Chen glanced at me, "they killed fifteen flies, fourteen mosquitoes, one rat. Ah, the rat I reported, it was a joint effort between the two families, so you can count it for them. Sparrows..."

"Let Mr. You speak for himself," Sister Zhao interrupted Mrs. Chen, determined to put me on the spot. "How many sparrows? Mr. You."

"None," I said honestly.

"What about cockroaches?"

Just as I couldn't answer, I suddenly saw Mrs. Chen point to the floor and shout in her clear voice.

"Mr. You, cockroach! Cockroach!"

I looked and indeed saw a rather large cockroach crawling there. I dared not delay. I took off my shoe, aimed accurately, and hit it hard. With a "smack," the cockroach's brains splattered everywhere. I felt very happy. Not because I had never killed a cockroach before, but because this time it was of great significance and could be recorded in history and passed down to future generations.

"One," I said excitedly, holding up the cockroach's remains to Sister Zhao.

She also happily wrote "One cockroach" under my name.

The one from the third floor to take the test was Little Zhu, a Young Pioneer.

"How many do you have, Little Zhu?"

"I don't know."

"What, didn't you kill any?" Sister Zhao's tone was very serious.

"I did, but I didn't record it. It's hard to record."

Mrs. Chen enthusiastically enlightened Little Zhu.

"About how many? Think about it."

"I really can't remember. We Young Pioneers can't lie."

Before Little Zhu finished speaking, Sister Zhao began to educate her.

"Keeping track of the numbers is very important. With numbers, we can report them, and the district can make accurate statistics, so we can know how many we have killed and how many are left. Then we can know... Do you understand?"

After Sister Zhao finished speaking, she tucked the ledger under her arm and went next door to the Wang family to continue her investigation.

    除了多少“四害”？
    尤熙文
    除四害任务布置以后，居民小组长赵大姐又多了一项工作，按月挨户调查消灭四害的具体数字，上报领导机关，据说区里抓得很紧。这项新任务，赵大姐是向小组传达过的，但运动虽已展开，大家也“除”得很勤，而记数这件事却没有引起大家的注意。所以来调查时大家竟报不出来。独有二楼的陈太太是有心人，记得清，说得明。
    “陈太太，你们这个月除了多少四害？”赵大姐一边问，一边拿着笔准备记。
    “我们呀，打死了苍蝇二十八只，蚊子三十六只，老鼠一只，麻雀三只，……”
    “麻雀是什么地方捉到的？”赵大姐唯恐人家虚报。
    “我们阿福在王家树上捉到的。”陈太太有根有据地答。
    “我没有捉到过麻雀，妈。”在旁边玩知了的阿福负责声明。
    “那你刚才在树上通什么？”
    “粘知了儿，你自己不了解瞎讲。”阿福不满妈妈，因为刚才他拿竹竿挨了一顿骂。
    “没有就没有！”陈太太又窘又气。她向赵大姐说，“麻雀没有。”
    “蟑螂呢？”
    “那不是四害，没记。”陈太太理直气壮地说。
    “以后也要记。”
    轮到我了。我非常紧张。我虽然对苍蝇、蚊子深恶痛绝，而且手下无情，但战果如何，确未经记录，也难于记录。面临考问，实觉难于对答。如果说没有打死过，不符事实，但说不上数字，也等于无案可稽。爱人又上了街，没人可商量。因而张口结舌，万分焦急。
    正当我狼狈不堪之际，陈太太给了我热情的帮助。
    “尤先生他们也很积极的，听尤太太说，”陈太太瞟了我一眼：“他们打了十五只苍蝇，十四只蚊子，一只老鼠，啊，就是我报的一只，是两家联合打的，所以也可以算他们的，麻雀……”
    “你还是让尤先生自己说，”赵大姐打断了陈太太的话，硬要将我的军。“麻雀多少？尤先生。”
    “没有。”我老老实实说。
    “蟑螂呢？”
    我正答不上时，忽见陈太太手指地板，以其清脆的嗓子狂叫。
    “尤先生，蟑螂！蟑螂！”
    我一眼看去，果见一只不小的蟑螂爬在那里，我不敢怠慢，脱下鞋子，看得准，打得狠，“啪”的一声，蟑螂脑浆四溅，我心中十分喜悦。倒并非我以前从没打死过蟑螂，而是因为这一次意义重大，可以登诸史册，传之后世。
    “一只。”我兴奋地提着蟑螂残骸走向赵大姐说。
    她也满意地把“蟑螂一只”四字写在了我的名下。
    三楼来应试的是少先队员小珠。
    “你们多少？小珠。”
    “不知道。”
    “怎么，没有打？”赵大姐语气很严肃。
    “打了，没记，不好记。”
    陈太太热情地对小珠启发。
    “大概多少？想想看。”
    “是记不清啊，我们少先队员不能骗人。”
    小珠的话没落音，赵大姐便向她展开了教育。
    “记清数字是很重要的，有了数字就可以报上去，区里就可以做出精确统计，才能知道我们打死了多少，还有多少，才能知道……你明白吗？”
    赵大姐说完，挟起簿子，到隔壁王家继续调查去了。
