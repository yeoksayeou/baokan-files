    A New Type of Vegetable Market
  　Ai Ling
    The expansion of a new type of state-run vegetable market – the Xidan Vegetable Market – is nearing completion.
    The original market was not very large, but now it has been expanded to 1,800 square meters. It has specialized sections for fish, pork, beef and mutton, chicken and duck, food products, vegetables, eggs, etc. From precious delicacies to popular items like bean sprouts and dried tofu, everything can be bought here. Previously, the entire market had fewer than 800 types of products, but now it has increased to more than 1,200. The vegetable market now sells nearly 10,000 yuan worth of produce every day. The "casserole dishes" appearing for the first time in the capital are now on sale in the vegetable market.
    Customers are most welcome in the food and fish sections. The food section has Sichuan preserved meat, Hunan fermented soybeans, Wuhan sauce trotters, Guangdong barbecued pork, and Heilongjiang tea sausages. In the fish section, a row of long and wide white tiled glass cabinets contains countless eels, crabs, and chilled Yellow River carp, shad, and flounder… It is truly like an aquatic product exhibition hall.
    The vegetable market is open from 6:00 AM to 8:30 PM, without a midday break, so employees can still buy vegetables after work. On Sundays, six additional sales points have been added in the crowded pork section. Pregnant women can purchase without queuing. Beside the fish section, washbasins are provided with hand towels hanging above them, with the words: "Please wash your hands after selecting fish."
    The vegetable market can also process goods and deliver them to customers' homes. The canteen of the Food Industry Department in Guang'anmen came to buy 20 jin of eels, and the vegetable market cut and cleaned the eels before delivering them. A purchasing agent from the Fuxingmen canteen originally wanted to buy 13 jin each of perch and prawns. The vegetable market was sold out of prawns, but the next day, as soon as the prawns arrived, they took the initiative to send someone to deliver them.
    Now, the vegetable market is still undergoing renovations while remaining open for business. The upper sides will be fitted with screens and movable glass windows. Once the renovation is complete, the vegetable market will be even brighter and more spacious, and customers can comfortably select their favorite vegetables here.

    一个新型的菜市场
  　艾玲
    一个新型的国营菜市场——西单菜市场就要扩建完了。
    这个菜市场，原有并不很大，现在扩大到一千八百平方公尺。这里设有鱼类、猪肉、牛羊肉、鸡鸭、食品、蔬菜、蛋品……等专卖部。从高贵的山珍海味到大众化的豆芽豆腐干，都可以在这里买到。以前，全菜市场不足八百种品种，现在增加到一千二百多种。菜市场每天都销售出近一万元的菜品。首都初次出现的“盆菜”，今天在菜市场开始出售了。
    顾客们最欢迎的是食品部和鱼类部。食品部有四川腊肉，湖南的豆豉，武汉的酱蹄膀，广东叉烧，黑龙江的茶肠。在鱼类部，一列又长又宽的白色的瓷砖玻璃柜，装着无数的鳝鱼、螃蟹，还有冰镇着的黄河鲤鱼、鲥鱼、比目鱼……真像个水产展览馆。
    菜市场从清晨六时开放到晚八时半，中午不休息，职工下班后还可以买到菜。星期日，在最拥挤的猪肉部，增设了六个销售处。孕妇可以不用排队优先购买。在鱼类部的两旁，还设置了洗手盆，架上挂着手巾，上面写着：“请挑选鱼，挑后洗手”。
    菜市场还可以为顾客加工和送货上门。住在广安门的食品工业部食堂来购买二十斤鳝鱼，菜市场就把鳝鱼割开洗净后送去了。复兴门食堂采购员本来要买鲈鱼、对虾各十三斤。菜市场的对虾卖完了，第二天，对虾一上市，他们就主动派人把对虾送去。
    现在，菜市场一边在营业，一边还在改建，顶上的两边，都要装上纱窗和活动玻璃窗，改建完了，菜市场将越发敞亮，顾客们可以舒适地在这里挑选自己爱吃的菜品。
