Xinhua News Agency, London, August 21st: Activity behind the scenes regarding the solution to the Suez Canal issue reached a fever pitch before the resumption of the London Conference on August 20th.

The representatives of the three Western powers, who insisted on "international control" of the canal, appeared particularly busy. Just before the conference began, Dulles, Lloyd, and French Ambassador to Britain Chauvel held talks, reportedly to discuss proposed amendments to the Dulles Plan.

At the same time, at 10 Downing Street, an important cabinet meeting, chaired by Eden, discussed the same issue.

Prior to this, Lloyd had convened a meeting of the three Baghdad Pact countries, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, and later held talks with the foreign ministers of Spain, France, Ethiopia, Iran, and New Zealand.

According to Western news agencies, all these activities by the three Western powers had one purpose: to win more countries' support for the Dulles Plan.

Another notable event on August 20th was a gathering of the heads of delegations from six Asian and African countries, including Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Ceylon, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. It was revealed that Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani, who chaired the meeting, believed that the Dulles Plan was unacceptable and requested that everyone walk out of the meeting if the plan was put to a vote in the plenary session. Some representatives expressed support for this, but others expressed opposition.

In addition, the Pakistani, Iranian, and Turkish delegations were also seeking support from some countries for amendments they intended to propose to the Dulles Plan. According to a Pakistani spokesman, the purpose of this amendment was "not to make Dulles' statement a final ultimatum, but to make it the basis for holding discussions that would involve Egypt."

The Spanish and Italian delegations were also engaged in separate activities, attempting to find a solution acceptable to Egypt. Spanish Foreign Minister Ataulfo said at a press conference on the morning of the 20th that international management of the Suez Canal was unnecessary. He said that it was difficult to imagine an international organization working within a country without harming that country's national sovereignty. He revealed that Spain would put forward its proposal, advocating for the participation of various countries in the Egyptian board of directors and the establishment of a special international advisory committee that could accept complaints. He said that Italy's attitude was close to that of Spain. Italian Foreign Minister Martino also indicated that free navigation could be achieved without international management.

On this day, Menon received Kase Shunichi, the Japanese Permanent Observer to the United Nations. He came to explain Japan's attitude at the conference to Menon. The day before, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu had stated that Japan supported the American plan in principle.

Menon also met with Shepilov, Abdulgani, and Corea, the chief representative of Ceylon to the conference.

Sabri, the Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Palace, paid two visits to Menon on the 20th.

### 伦敦会议复会前会外活动十分紧张  英法美加紧为杜勒斯的计划寻求支持  西意代表企图寻找埃及能接受的办法

    伦敦会议复会前会外活动十分紧张
    英法美加紧为杜勒斯的计划寻求支持
    西意代表企图寻找埃及能接受的办法
    据新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：围绕着如何解决苏彝士运河问题的会外活动，在八月二十日伦敦会议复会前，达到了十分紧张的程度。
    坚持要对运河实行“国际管制”的西方三国的代表显得特别匆忙。就在会议开始前，杜勒斯、劳埃德和法国驻英国大使肖维尔还进行了会谈，据说是讨论拟议中可能提出的对杜勒斯计划的修正案。
    同一个时候，在唐宁街十号，有一个重要的内阁会议，在艾登的主持下在讨论同一个问题。
    在这之前，劳埃德曾召集伊朗、巴基斯坦和土耳其三个巴格达条约国家举行会议，以后又同西班牙、法国、埃塞俄比亚、伊朗和新西兰等国的外交部长进行了交谈。
    据西方通讯社报道，西方三国所有这些活动都是为了一个目的：争取更多的国家来支持杜勒斯的计划。
    八月二十日另一个引人注目的活动是，巴基斯坦、土耳其、伊朗、锡兰、埃塞俄比亚和印度尼西亚等六个亚非国家代表团团长的集会。据透露，主持这个会议的印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼认为杜勒斯的计划是不能接受的，他要求如果这个计划在全体会议上交付表决的话大家就退出会场。有些代表表示支持这一点，但是也有一些代表表示反对。
    此外，巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其代表团还在争取一些国家来支持它们打算对杜勒斯计划提出的修正。据巴基斯坦一个发言人说，这个修正的目的是“不希望杜勒斯的声明变成最后通牒而是希望它成为举行将使埃及参加的讨论的基础”。
    西班牙和意大利代表团也在单独进行活动，企图寻找一个能够为埃及所接受的解决办法。西班牙外交部长阿塔霍在二十日上午的记者招待会上说，国际管理苏彝士运河是不必要的。他说，一个国际机构要在一个国家内进行工作而不损害那个国家的民族主权，是很难设想的。他透露西班牙将提出它的建议，主张埃及董事会有各国参加，并且成立可以接受控诉的特别国际咨询委员会。他说，意大利的态度是接近西班牙的。意大利外交部长马蒂诺也表示，可以不用国际管理而实现自由通航。
    这一天，梅农接见了日本常驻联合国观察员加濑俊一。他是来向梅农解释日本在会议上所要采取的态度的。在前一天，日本外务相重光曾经发表谈话说，日本在原则上支持美国的计划。
    梅农还会见了谢皮洛夫、阿卜杜加尼和锡兰参加会议的首席代表科里亚。
    埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里二十日曾经两次拜会梅农。
