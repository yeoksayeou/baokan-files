    A Democratic and Progressive Family
    Li Yan
    The family is the basic unit of people's social life. Whether family life is well-managed will directly affect the work and production enthusiasm of family members, and will also directly affect the progress of family members.
    How can a family be united and harmonious, so that each member feels happy and makes progress? Zhu Bin's family, the director of the Lizi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shiquan Township, Fuling County, Sichuan Province, is a good example.
    Zhu Bin is a veteran, a member of the Communist Party. His family includes his wife, two sons, a daughter, and a daughter-in-law. The eldest son is a member of the Communist Party, served in the army in Korea and received four citations. The second son, Zhu Wangzheng, is in elementary school and is the captain of the Young Pioneers. His daughter, Zhu Wangbi, is the leader of the youth shock team of the agricultural cooperative. Comrade Zhu Bin returned home in 1952. After returning home, he paid attention to helping his wife, Xia Tingyu, improve her ideological awareness. He asked his wife, "You are a people's representative, working actively, what for?" His wife said, "Now the working people are in charge! If we don't work hard, how can the fruits of liberation be secure?" Zhu Bin told her that our efforts are not only to preserve the fruits of liberation, but that the goal of the revolution is socialism and communism; he also explained the beautiful prospects of socialism and communism to her and how to become a Communist Party member, etc. With his help, his wife improved her awareness and gloriously joined the Party in 1954. Now she is a member of the Lizi Agricultural Cooperative's administrative committee. Xia Tingyu can also promptly offer opinions on Zhu Bin's shortcomings. For example, when Zhu Bin first returned from the army, he couldn't stand the slow and dragging meetings of the masses and the backward behavior of some farmers, and he lost his temper several times, which made some people afraid of him. After Xia Tingyu learned about this, she said to him:
  “We must patiently persuade and educate people regarding their shortcomings and mistakes; otherwise, mutual aid and cooperation will not be successful.” Zhu Bin accepted Xia Tingyu’s criticism and made a self-criticism among the masses. Afterwards, his work became more patient than before. They also frequently offer well-intentioned criticism to their children and daughter-in-law. The main method is to hold family meetings. Family meetings are informal, sometimes held after meals, sometimes in the evenings, and sometimes they just chat casually during meals. This method works very well. For example, Yu Sude, the daughter-in-law, only married into the Zhu family this spring. Seeing that everyone in this family was making progress and the whole family was harmonious, but she was neither a cadre nor had she joined any revolutionary organization, she often sighed, "Alas! I'm the only one lagging behind." When Xia Tingyu found out, she called a family meeting and asked everyone to discuss: "What is our future like, and how should young people work hard?" When everyone discussed the beautiful prospects of socialist society and people's happy lives, they all put forward their plans to work hard for the socialist cause. Only Yu Sude didn't speak. Xia Tingyu said to her, "Look, the future of socialism is so bright! Everyone is working hard for socialism! You are young and smart. As long as you work hard, won't you make progress quickly?" Yu Sude was very happy to hear this and joined the youth shock team of the agricultural production cooperative. However, one day, Yu Sude was upset and cried again. No one knew why. When asked, she wouldn't say. Xia Tingyu said at the family meeting, "Our family is different from other families. We value democracy the most. We bring all problems to the table for discussion. If you see any shortcomings in me, feel free to criticize them; if I have any opinions about you, I will never hide them. It's better to talk them out so they can be resolved." The daughter-in-law then revealed that it was because she had asked her younger sister, Zhu Wangbi, to fetch lamp oil for the civilian school, but her sister had not brought it back. Everyone criticized Zhu Wangbi, and the knot in Yu Sude's heart was untied. Another evening, Yu Sude heard Xia Tingyu criticizing Zhu Wangzheng and thought that Xia Tingyu was indirectly blaming herself. She felt so wronged that she didn't even eat dinner. Xia Tingyu went to her and said, "We will never beat around the bush and criticize one while referring to another. If we criticize Wangzheng, it won't be a criticism of you. Young people should be more magnanimous and not be suspicious in the future." Everyone also offered their opinions at the family meeting, and Yu Sude was very touched. Zhu Bin and his wife can also humbly listen to the opinions of their children and daughter-in-law and pay attention to correcting their own shortcomings. When they encounter problems that cannot be solved at the family meeting, they go to the Party organization to study and resolve them. It is precisely because they have promoted democracy and carried out criticism that the whole family is united, loving, and everyone is making progress. There have never been any quarrels, table-pounding, or bench-smashing incidents.
    We should promote this kind of democratic and progressive family life, so that every family can be united and help each other, and everyone can work and produce happily, so that family life becomes a force to promote people's progress, driving people to play a greater role in the socialist cause.

### 一个民主进步的家庭

    一个民主进步的家庭
    李雁
    家庭是人们社会生活的基础单位，家庭生活搞得好不好，会直接影响到家庭成员的工作情绪和生产情绪，也会直接影响到家庭成员的进步。
    怎么样才能使得一个家庭团结和睦，每个成员都感到愉快，都有进步呢？四川省涪陵县石泉乡梨子农业生产合作社主任朱斌的家庭，就是一个榜样。
    朱斌是复员军人、共产党员，家里有妻子、两个儿子、一个女儿、一个儿媳。大儿子是共产党员，参军在朝鲜立过四次功。二儿子朱王正在小学念书，是少先队大队长，女儿朱王碧是农业合作社的青年突击队长。朱斌同志是1952年回家的。回家后，就注意帮助妻子夏廷玉提高思想觉悟。他问妻子：“你当了人民代表，积极工作，是为了什么呀？”妻子说：“现在是劳动人民当家作主嘛！要是不努力，翻身果实怎能牢靠哩？”朱斌告诉她，我们努力不单是为了保住翻身果实，革命的目标是社会主义和共产主义；又给她讲解社会主义和共产主义的美景，怎样才能当一个共产党员等。他妻子在他帮助下，提高了觉悟，在1954年，光荣地入了党，现在她是梨子农业社的社务委员。夏廷玉对于朱斌的缺点，也能及时提出意见，比如朱斌刚从部队回来时，看不惯群众开会拖拖拉拉的劲儿，看不惯有些农民的落后表现，发了几次脾气，有些人就怕他。夏廷玉知道后，就对他说：
  “对人家的缺点和错误，要耐心说服教育，不然，互助合作就搞不好。”朱斌接受了夏廷玉的批评，在群众当中作了检讨，以后做工作就较过去耐心了。他们对待子女和儿媳，也是经常进行善意的批评。主要方法是召开家庭会议，家庭会议不拘形式，有时在饭后开，有时在晚上开，也有时就在吃饭的时候随便谈谈，这样做效果很好。如媳妇余素德，今年春上才嫁到朱家来，她看到这一家人都进步，全家和睦，只有自己既不是干部，又没有参加革命组织，时常叹气：“唉！就我一个人落后。”夏廷玉知道了，就召开家庭会议，叫大家讨论：“我们的前途怎么样，青年人应该怎样努力？”大家讨论到社会主义社会的美景，人们的幸福生活时，都提出自己怎样为社会主义事业努力的打算，只有余素德不说话。夏廷玉对她说：“你看，社会主义前途多好啊！哪一个不为社会主义努力！你年青，又聪明，只要努力，进步还不快吗？”余素德听了很高兴。就参加了农业生产合作社的青年突击队。可是，有一天，余素德又呕气哭了，大家都不知道什么原因，问她，她也不讲。夏廷玉就在家庭会上说：“我们这个家庭和别个家庭不一样，最讲究民主，什么问题都拿到桌面上谈。你看我有什么缺点，只管批评；我对你有什么意见，也决不会藏着不说，谈出来才好解决。”媳妇这才说出来，是因为她托妹妹朱王碧给民校打灯油，妹妹没有打来。大家就批评了朱王碧，余素德心里的疙瘩解开了。又有一天晚上，余素德听到夏廷玉批评朱王正，以为夏廷玉是含沙射影地责怪自己，委屈得连饭也不吃了。夏廷玉就去跟她说：“我们决不会扯蓑衣盖石磙地指这个说那个，批评的是王正，就不会是批评你，年青人应该大气些，以后再不要多心了。”家庭会议上大家也提出了意见，余素德很受感动。朱斌夫妇有了缺点，也能虚心听取子女和儿媳的意见，并注意改正。他们在家庭会议上，碰到不能解决的问题，就去找党的组织研究解决。正因为他们发扬了民主、开展了批评，所以一家人团结友爱，人人进步，从没有发生过吵吵闹闹、拍桌子摔板凳的事。
    我们应该提倡这种民主进步的家庭生活，使家家都能团结互助，人人都能愉快地工作和生产，使家庭生活成为推动人们进步的力量，推动着人们在社会主义事业中发挥更大的作用。
