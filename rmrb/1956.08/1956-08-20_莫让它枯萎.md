    Don't Let It Wither
    Shu Mo
    The Shaanxi Folk Choir of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, due to their performances having a strong sense of life, distinct local characteristics, natural and bright voices, and authentic and simple emotional expression, were not only welcomed by Beijing audiences, but also received enthusiastic praise from the general public in cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan when they participated in the China Folk and Classical Music Touring Performance Group organized by the Chinese Musicians Association at the end of 1954. It should be said that this is a newly born, beautiful, and very lovable flower in the garden of Chinese vocal art.
    A year and a half later, I heard them sing again in a recent summer music and dance evening. Before listening, I thought their performance must be more moving than before, but after listening, I was very worried about this flower; I felt that it was not as strong and bright as before, the beautiful color was a bit dim, and it showed signs of withering. The number of performers seemed to be getting smaller and smaller, and the lineup seemed so thin. Although there had been some improvement in voice training, the expression of emotion was not as capable of arousing strong infection in the audience as before. They did not have many new programs, the performance form was not diverse enough, and there was a lack of a lively atmosphere. What is most puzzling is that there used to be a folk band to accompany them, but this time even the band accompaniment was canceled. As the saying goes, even the best peony needs green leaves to support it, let alone such a newly born flower that is just opening!
    The reason why this flower has encountered such a situation is probably because the gardeners lack cultivation of it. You should know that a native flower, due to the suitability of the soil and climate, will bloom a very kind, both bright and beautiful flower as long as you put a little effort into it. Pay more attention to this lovely and precarious native flower, don't let it wither!

    莫让它枯萎
    舒模
    中央歌舞团的陕北民间合唱队由于她们的演唱具有浓厚的生活气息，地方色彩鲜明，声音自然而嘹亮，感情的表现真实、朴素，因此不仅受到北京听众的欢迎，1954年底她们参加中国音乐家协会主办的中国民间、古典音乐巡回演出团，在上海、广州、武汉等十大城市演出，同样得到各地广大群众热烈的赞赏。应该说，这是我国声乐艺术百花园中一朵新生的、美丽的、十分令人喜爱的花。
    事隔一年有半，在最近一次夏季音乐舞蹈晚会中，又听到她们的演唱。在未听之前，我想她们的演唱一定比以前更动人了，听了以后，我却很为这朵花担心；我感到它已经不像以前那样茁壮而鲜艳了，美丽的色彩也有些暗淡了，呈显着枯萎的现象。演唱的人像是越来越少，阵容显得那样单薄。在声音训练上虽然有了一些提高，但是感情的表现也不像以前那样能引起听众强烈的感染。她们的新节目不多，演唱形式也不够多样，缺少活泼生动的气氛。最令人不解的，原来还有一个民族乐队为她们伴奏，这一次连乐队伴奏也取消了。俗话说，牡丹虽好还需绿叶扶持，何况是这样一朵新生的，刚在开放的花呢！
    这朵花之所以遭到这样的境遇，恐怕还是园丁们对它缺少培植。要知道，一朵土生土长的花，由于土地、气候的适宜，只要对它稍下点工夫，就会开放出令人感到十分亲切、既鲜艳而又美丽的花朵来的。更多地关心一点这朵可爱而又可危的土生土长的花吧，莫让它枯萎！
