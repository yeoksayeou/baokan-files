Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Cairo dispatch: Egyptian Finance Minister Kishuni said on August 21st that the Egyptian Ministry of Finance has taken necessary measures to defeat the actions and conspiracies of Western countries aimed at harming Egypt's foreign trade in terms of capital turnover, especially sabotaging the new cotton harvest.

In order to create economic difficulties for Egypt and force it to give up the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Britain, France, and the United States had already announced the freezing of Egyptian assets in these countries at the end of July.

Kishuni said that he had held a series of meetings with the general managers of Egyptian and Arab banks established in Egypt. These meetings discussed various measures to cope with the freezing of Egypt's deposits in Britain, France, and the United States.

On August 20th, Kishuni also held talks on economic cooperation with Soviet Ambassador to Egypt Kiselev, Indian Ambassador to Egypt Ali Yavar Jung, and Syrian Ambassador to Egypt Azzam, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 22nd: Indian Deputy Minister of Finance Baghat said in the People's Assembly today that Britain's freezing of Egyptian pound funds will not directly affect trade between India and Egypt. He said that even if any difficulties arise, the Indian government will take the necessary steps to ensure trade between the two countries.

While answering questions in the People's Assembly, Baghat pointed out that, according to the arrangements for implementing the trade agreement between India and Egypt, all Egyptian exports to India will be paid in Indian rupees. Of these rupees, Egypt will use 40% to purchase goods in India, and the remaining 60% can be converted into pounds sterling if Egypt wishes. He said that since trade between India and Egypt uses rupees, the British government's restrictions on Egypt's sterling reserves will not have a direct impact on trade between India and Egypt.

    印埃两国贸易将不受英国冻结埃及英镑资金的直接影响
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：埃及财政部长凯舒尼八月二十一日说，埃及财政部已经采取必要措施来击败西方国家目的在于损害埃及对外贸易方面的资金周转，特别是破坏新棉花收成的行动和阴谋。
    为了在埃及的经济上造成困难，迫使埃及放弃把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，英国、法国和美国早在七月底已经先后宣布冻结埃及在这些国家的资财。
    凯舒尼说，他已经同埃及和在埃及开设的各阿拉伯银行的总经理们开了一系列的会议。这些会议讨论了采取各种措施以应付埃及在英国、法国和美国的存款遭受冻结。
    在八月二十日，凯舒尼还分别同苏联驻埃及大使基谢廖夫、印度驻埃及大使阿里·雅瓦尔·忠格和叙利亚驻埃及大使阿扎姆举行了关于经济合作的会谈。
    新华社新德里22日电　印度财政部驻议会秘书巴加特今天在人民院说，英国冻结埃及的英镑资金将不会直接影响印度和埃及的贸易。他说，即使引起了任何困难，印度政府也要采取必要的步骤来保证两国之间的贸易往来。
    巴加特在人民院答复质询的时候指出，根据执行印度和埃及的贸易协定的安排，埃及向印度的所有输出都将用印度卢比支付。在这些卢比中，埃及将用40％在印度购买商品，其余的60％，如果埃及愿意可以把它们换成英镑。他说，由于印度和埃及之间的贸易使用卢比，英国政府对埃及的英镑储备的限制，将不会对印度和埃及之间的贸易有直接影响。
