Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th: The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Chezhan Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, launched a production inspection while formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan, mobilizing cooperative members to calculate accounts of increased production and income, overcoming the phenomenon of blind optimism and relaxation of current production among the cooperative members.

The various crops sown by the Liming Agricultural Cooperative last winter and this spring have yielded bumper harvests. According to the cooperative's recent calculations, the grain harvested per mu from wheat, early rice, and mid-season rice alone this year will increase by about 10% compared to the total grain harvested per mu last year. Following the pre-distribution of the wheat harvest, cooperative members received batches of rice from the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative members developed a sense of complacency and relaxation, believing that the bulk (referring to already harvested crops) was in hand, and it wouldn't matter if the smaller portion (referring to autumn harvest crops) yielded less. Therefore, they relaxed the work of seizing the time to plant late-autumn crops and also relaxed the management of late rice, cotton, and other crops.

In mid-August, when the cooperative was formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan, the cooperative's management committee discovered this situation. They then launched a production inspection throughout the cooperative, mobilizing cooperative members to calculate whether this year's "thousand-jin yield plan" could be realized and whether it could guarantee increased income for the vast majority of cooperative members. The results of the inspection by all twelve production teams revealed that over 200 mu of land that should have been planted with buckwheat in a timely manner had not been planted, and the area of late rice fields and cotton fields affected by drought and pests was gradually expanding. If this relaxation continued, the autumn harvest crops, which account for more than 30% of the year's total, would inevitably suffer reduced yields. After calculating the accounts, the cooperative members generally realized that if this year's planned thousand-jin production target could not be achieved, it would not be possible to guarantee increased income for more than 90% of the cooperative members. In this way, the cooperative members' complacency and laxity were overcome. Recently, men and women cooperative members have been engaged in seizing the time to plant late-autumn crops and strengthening field management of late rice and cotton fields.

### 黎明农业社开展生产大检查  克服社员生产松劲现象

    黎明农业社开展生产大检查
    克服社员生产松劲现象
    新华社武汉29日电　湖北省孝感县车站乡黎明农业社在制定秋收分配方案时，发动社员算增产和增加收入账，克服了社员们盲目乐观、放松当前生产的现象。
    黎明农业社去冬今春播种的各种作物都得到了丰收。据这个社最近计算，仅今年小麦和早、中稻每亩收的粮食就比去年全年每亩收的要增加一成左右。紧接着麦收预分后，社员们又从社里分得一批批的稻谷。这样，社员们便产生了满足松懈的情绪，认为大头已到手（指已收作物），小头（指秋收作物）少收些也不在乎，因此，放松了抢种晚秋作物的工作，对晚稻和棉花等作物也放松了管理。
    8月中旬，这个社制定秋收分配方案时，社的管理委员会发现这种情况后，便在全社开展了一次生产大检查，发动社员算了今年千斤丰产计划能否实现和能否保证绝大部分社员增加收入的两笔账。结果，全社十二个生产队在检查时发现，有二百多亩田该抢种荞麦的没有及时抢种，晚稻田和棉田里发生干旱和虫害的面积也逐渐扩大，如果再放松下去，占全年30％以上的秋收作物势必减产。经过算账，社员们普遍认识到今年制定的千斤生产计划如果不能实现，也就不能保证90％以上的社员增加收入。这样，社员们的满足、松懈思想克服了，最近这些天，男女社员们都投入了抢种晚秋作物和加强晚稻、棉田田间管理等劳动。
