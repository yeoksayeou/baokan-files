Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th - The more than 1,300 *li* of desert area along the ancient Great Wall from Fugu to Dingbian in northern Shaanxi, where over 155,000 *mu* of "Great Green Wall" shelterbelts were constructed this spring, are now lush and green.

The area along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi used to be barren. After liberation, the people's government led the peasants in a massive afforestation campaign, planting more than 50,000 *mu* of trees over the past seven years, resulting in many green spots in this barren land. The young trees in Qilish, Liulin Tan, and Xuejia Miao Tan in Yulin County are now providing shade. The forest belts from Yangqiaopan to Fengjia Maozi and from Yin Da Wan to Caojia Kengzi in Jingbian County have prevented sand dune movement within a range of more than 130 *li*. The riparian forests along the banks of the Lu River in Hengshan County have protected farmland in the river valley from wind and sand damage. In areas where these forest belts are effective, crop yields have begun to gradually increase, and some previously uncultivable sandy wastelands have also been planted with crops.

    “万里绿长城”一片葱绿
    新华社延安15日电　陕西北部从府谷到定边一千三百多华里的古长城沿线沙漠地区，今年春天营造的十五万五千多亩“万里绿长城”防沙林，现已一片葱绿。
    陕北长城沿线过去一片荒凉。解放后，人民政府领导农民展开了声势浩大的造林运动，七年来造林五万多亩，使这个不毛之地出现了不少的绿点。榆林县的七里沙、柳林滩和薛家庙滩等地的幼林现已成荫。靖边县杨桥畔至冯家峁子和尹大湾至曹家坑子的林带，防止了一百三十多华里以内的沙丘流动。横山县芦河两岸的护岸林，保护了河谷地区的农田不受风沙为害。在这些林带发挥作用的地区，农作物产量已开始逐渐增加，有些原来不能耕种的沙荒也种上了庄稼。
