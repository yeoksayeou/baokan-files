Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke on August 10th at an informal meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding the London conference on the Suez Canal issue. According to the Press Trust of India, he said at the meeting that one point India would absolutely insist on was: "It opposes any attempt to force a solution through by majority at the London Conference."

Nehru said the Suez Canal crisis was the most difficult international problem India had encountered since gaining independence. Answering questions, he said that India had not promised to agree to any specific plan when it decided to attend the London conference. It would not defend anyone, but it would seek to find a solution that guaranteed Egypt's sovereignty while respecting and recognizing the importance of the canal as an international waterway. He said that Menon, India's representative attending the London conference, would hold talks with Egyptian leaders in Cairo, which would be helpful to the Indian delegation.

Someone asked Nehru whether he believed Eden had stiffened his tone in his broadcast speech after learning the content of his statement in the People's House. Nehru did not answer the question. He said that while the British Prime Minister's broadcast speech was tough, what the British Labor Party leaders Gaitskell and Herbert Morrison said was even tougher. However, compared with the raging words published in France, these three people's words were mild.

Nehru, in asking the committee members to pay attention to the explosive nature of the situation, pointed out that the Mediterranean now has American warships, and the Soviet Union, as a signatory to the 1888 Convention of Constantinople, has the right, like other signatories, to send two warships to each end of the canal in an emergency.

    尼赫鲁表示印度将在伦敦会议上
    反对以多数强行通过解决方案
    新华社新德里11日电　印度总理尼赫鲁八月十日在议会的外交咨询委员会非正式会议上谈到关于苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议。据印度报业托辣斯报道，他在会上说，印度将绝对坚持的一点是：“它反对任何在伦敦会议上以多数强行通过解决方案的企图”。
    尼赫鲁说，苏彝士运河危机是印度在获得独立以后所遇到的最困难的国际问题。他在回答问题的时候说，印度在决定参加伦敦会议的时候并没有答应要同意任何具体的方案。它不会为任何人辩护，但是，它将设法寻找保障埃及的主权同时尊重承认运河作为国际水道的重要性的条约的解决办法。他说，印度出席伦敦会议的代表梅农将要在开罗同埃及领袖进行会谈，这将对印度代表团有帮助。
    有人问尼赫鲁，他是否相信艾登是在得知他在人民院发表的声明的内容，以后才在广播演说中措词强硬起来的。尼赫鲁没有回答这个问题，他说，虽然英国首相的广播演说是强硬的，但是，英国反对党工党领袖盖次克尔和赫伯特·摩里逊所说的话更加强硬，但是，如果同在法国发表的那些气势汹汹的话比较，这三个人的话都是温和的。
    尼赫鲁在要求委员们注意局势的爆炸性质的时候指出，地中海现在有美国的军舰，苏联作为1888年君士坦丁堡公约的缔约国，同其他缔约国一样有权在紧急的时候派遣两艘军舰驻在这条运河的两端。
