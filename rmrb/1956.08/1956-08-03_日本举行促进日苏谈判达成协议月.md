    日本举行促进日苏谈判达成协议月
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：八月一日在东京举行的日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议执行委员会扩大会议决定，目前的运动要集中在促进日苏谈判立即达成协议上。
    从八月一日起到谈判达成协议为止的期间，已经被定为促进日苏谈判达成协议月。在这个期间的主要活动是，邀请各界著名人士和各种团体积极地给予协助，并且向日苏谈判的日本代表团转达这些团体要求日苏谈判立即达成协议的决议。
    会议还决定，准备在九月十五日召开群众大会。如果在召开这个大会以前，日苏谈判已经达成协议，将把这个大会作为一个庆祝大会；如果谈判到那个时候还没有达成协议，这个大会将成为抗议日本政府和展开要求谈判达成协议的更强烈的运动的开始。
