The people of Shangyang Township, Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, are widely praising the heroic deeds of He Lingdi, a twenty-four-year-old female Communist Party member, who dedicated her glorious life in the struggle to defend against the typhoon, protecting the lives and property of the masses.

On the afternoon of August 1st, the Communist Party branch of Shangyang Township near Xiangshan Port received a notification that a level 12 typhoon would make landfall at Xiangshan Port. The branch immediately convened village cadres to arrange preparations for typhoon defense and mobilize all forces to protect the seawall.

However, the cadres from Zhongjiawan Xia Village, located in a dangerous section of the seawall, were unable to arrive. Just as the branch secretary was getting anxious, Communist Party member and township women's federation director He Lingdi stood up in front of the branch secretary and said, "I'll go!"

The branch secretary, considering that He Lingdi had already been inspecting the seawall in the rain for an afternoon, had just taken off her wet clothes and finished dinner, and that it was already dark, was worried about letting her go to such a dangerous place and tried to persuade her to stay in the township to manage the warehouse. But He Lingdi said, "Protecting the seawall is more important. I'll go to the seawall!" With a flick of her braid, she hurriedly left in the rain.

He Lingdi rushed to Zhongjiawan and conveyed the instructions of the district committee to the cadres in the village. Regardless of everyone's advice, she resolutely stayed and worked with everyone to protect the seawall. She took off her soaking wet clothes, changed into a borrowed old cloth jacket, and followed everyone to the outer seawall.

At 7:00 PM, fierce waves, aided by the wind, crashed against the base of the seawall, and more than two meters of the newly built stone revetment on the east seawall collapsed. He Lingdi, with a flashlight, instructed farmers Zhou Wenjing and others to quickly jump into the water to stack the stone revetment, finally blocking the gap. By 10:00 PM, the wind was blowing harder and the tide was rising higher. Roaring waves, mixed with the sound of the wind, slammed into the seawall like mad. No matter how hard people tried to rescue it, the eroded gaps became more and more numerous, and for a time, most of the entire seawall surface was stripped away by the waves. Communist Party member Zheng Qinglian, seeing the situation was bad, shouted, "Retreat! Defend the inner seawall!"

The inner seawall protected the lives and property of more than 100 households in Zhongjiawan Village, and the 500 mu of farmland within the seawall all depended on this inner seawall for protection. At this time, everyone had only one belief: to protect the farmland, to protect life and property. He Lingdi also hurriedly followed village cadre Lin Xinyuan through the cotton fields, wading through the water and crossing two small rivers, falling and getting up again, and rushing to the inner seawall. But the surging tide also followed people's footsteps, breaking through the outer seawall and rushing towards the culverts of the small ponds. Before He Lingdi could catch her breath, she rolled up her sleeves and carried mud bags. Raindrops hit her face like whips, and the strong wind made it impossible to stand up straight, but He Lingdi persisted.

After a while, Zheng Qinglian arrived. Seeing that He Lingdi was covered in mud, her clothes were soaked through, and she was too exhausted to continue, he pushed her aside and carried the mud himself. But He Lingdi, seeing waves more than one person high crashing into the seawall and the mud bags no longer holding back the water, immediately prepared door panels with Zheng Qinglian to block the water. At this moment, the strong wind pushed the tide in from the top of the seawall, and suddenly the water inside the seawall was waist-deep. Zheng Guoyang, seeing the critical situation behind them, hurriedly helped He Lingdi swim to safety. But just after swimming across two cotton ditches, a wave swept He Lingdi away, and after another roll of the waves, He Lingdi disappeared...

That night, many township cadres anxiously hoped for her return, and many cadres cried for her several times. The next day, as soon as it dawned, people went out in the rain to search for her, and it was not until the morning of August 3rd that He Lingdi's body was found in a thicket of thorns after the water receded.

The masses, with heavy hearts, collected her body. The Deputy Commissioner of the Ningbo Commissioner's Office and the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Zhenhai County Committee and others came to Shangyang Township on the morning of the 4th to pay their respects to the martyr He Lingdi and express their condolences to her family. On August 11th, the Ningbo Commissioner's Office awarded He Lingdi the glorious title of revolutionary martyr.

He Lingdi joined the Party in 1954 and served successively as the director of the village women's federation, village chief, deputy director of the Jiaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, and director of the township women's federation. The cooperative she led won the title of provincial second-class high-yield model cooperative last year.

    她献出了光辉的生命
    记女共产党员贺玲娣防护海塘的英勇事迹
    浙江省镇海县上阳乡的人民，到处传颂着二十四岁的女共产党员贺玲娣在这次防御台风的斗争中，为了防护海塘，保卫群众的生命财产，献出了自己光辉生命的英勇事迹。
    八月一日下午，象山港附近上阳乡的中共支部接到了十二级台风将在象山港登陆的通知。支部立刻召集各村干部，布置防御台风的准备工作，动员一切力量保护海塘。
    但是在海塘险要地段的钟家湾下村的干部却没有能够赶来。支部书记正在焦急的时候，共产党员、乡妇联主任贺玲娣挺身站在支部书记面前说：“我去吧！”
    支部书记考虑到贺玲娣已经冒雨巡视海塘一个下午了，湿衣服刚脱下，晚饭才吃完，加上天色已经黑下来了，不放心让她到这个危险的地方去，劝她留在乡里管仓库。但是贺玲娣说：“守海塘更重要，我就到海塘上去！”辫子一甩，就匆匆地冒雨走了。
    贺玲娣一口气赶到钟家湾，向在这个村的干部传达了区委的指示。她不管大家的劝告，坚决地留下来和大家一块儿防护海塘。她脱下湿淋淋的衣服，换上借来的一件老布夹袄，就跟着大家奔向外海塘去了。
    夜晚七点钟，凶猛的海浪借着风势向塘脚冲来，东塘新砌边的石堪坍下了两公尺多。贺玲娣打着电筒，让农民周文经等赶紧跳下水去垒石堪，总算堵住了缺口。到晚上十点多钟，风愈刮愈大，海潮愈涨愈高，咆哮的浪潮夹着风声，发疯似地扑向海塘。不管人们怎样抢救，被冲刷的缺口越来越多，一时整个塘面被海浪剥去了大半。共产党员郑庆连眼看形势不好，大喊：“撤下去，保卫里塘！”
    里塘保护着钟家湾村一百多户群众的生命财产，塘内的五百亩田地全靠这条里塘护牢。这时大家只有一个信念：保卫田地，保卫生命财产。贺玲娣也急急忙忙地跟着村干部林信元穿过棉地，涉水跨过两条小河，跌倒又爬起，赶到了里塘。但是汹涌的潮水也跟着人们的脚步冲破外塘，朝着小塘田的涵洞里猛冲。贺玲娣喘息未定，就撩起衣袖搬运泥袋。雨点像鞭子似的打得脸上发痛，大风吹得人直不起腰来，但是贺玲娣仍然坚持着。
    一会儿，郑庆连赶到了。他看见贺玲娣满身污泥，衣服透湿，人已经劳累得实在不行了，就把她推在一边，自己搬运泥土。但是贺玲娣眼看一人多高的浪头直往塘里打来，泥袋已经挡不住水，又立刻和郑庆连准备门板挡水。这时候，大风推着海潮从塘上涌进来，一下子塘内水深及腰，在后面的郑国阳看见情况危急，赶忙搀着贺玲娣泅水转移。但是刚泅过两条棉沟，一个浪头却把贺玲娣卷走，波浪再一翻滚，就看不见贺玲娣的踪影了……
    当天深夜，乡里很多干部还焦急地盼望着她能够回来，不少干部为她哭了好几次。第二天天刚亮，人们就冒雨四出寻找，直到八月三日清晨，才在退了水的荆棘丛里发现了贺玲娣的尸体。
    群众怀着悲痛的心情，收殓了她的尸体。宁波专员公署副专员和中共镇海县委副书记等在四日上午来到上阳乡贺玲娣烈士的灵前致哀，慰问了她的家属。八月十一日，宁波专署授予贺玲娣以革命烈士的光荣称号。
    贺玲娣在1954年入党，曾先后担任村妇联主任、村长、蕉山农业生产合作社副主任和乡妇联主任。她所领导的社，去年曾经获得全省二等丰产模范社的称号。
