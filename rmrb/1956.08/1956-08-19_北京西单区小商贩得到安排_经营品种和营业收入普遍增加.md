    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Small vendors in Beijing's Xidan district have, through arrangements, largely overcome difficulties in capital and purchasing goods. Small vendors have generally increased the variety of their business; general merchandise vendors have typically added forty to fifty kinds of commodities. Fast-selling items such as hexachlorocyclohexane powder, hemp rope, and mothballs are now available. Oil, salt, and sundries stores have also added mosquito coils, some small general merchandise, and cultural and stationery items. Their business revenue has therefore generally increased compared to the past.

    The main difficulties for small vendors in Xidan district originally were small capital and difficulty in purchasing goods. For example, oil, salt, and sundries stores needed to purchase many commodities, and each time they purchased a commodity, they had to stand in line. Many small vendors reflected that they spent most of their time each day in "lines." At the same time, because of the small capital, they could not purchase much at once, so they had to stand in line every day. If buying small general merchandise such as buttons and hair clips, each purchase had to be a "luo" (the wholesale starting point was one "luo"), enough for several years of sales, so they had to avoid stocking this kind of goods. Because of this, these small vendors often did not have a full variety of commodities, resulting in business losses. In the first half of the year, twenty out of the thirty-four general merchandise stalls in the district suffered losses.

    In late June of this year, relevant units in Beijing organized a work team to Xidan district to arrange and transform the work of small vendors. Central stores were established in industries such as general merchandise, food groceries, and local produce foods, responsible for leading the business of small vendors and cooperative groups organized by small vendors. Regulations stipulate that small vendors can freely choose to purchase goods, without forced bundling. At the same time, the wholesale starting point was abolished; small vendors can buy as much or as little as they please. Priority is given to delivering major or scarce goods to small vendors. For small vendors with capital difficulties, the central store assists them in obtaining loans from the bank based on their needs, and also pays taxes to the tax bureau on their behalf. These measures have greatly facilitated small vendors in their operations.

    北京西单区小商贩得到安排
    经营品种和营业收入普遍增加
    新华社17日讯　北京市西单区的小商小贩，经过安排，资金和进货上的困难大体上得到克服。各小商贩普遍增加了经营品种，百货业的小商贩一般增加了四、五十种商品品种，六氯粉、麻绳、卫生球等快销货现在都有，油盐杂货店也增添了蚊香、部分小百货和文化用品。他们的营业收入因此普遍比过去增加。
    西单区的小商小贩原来的主要困难是资金少、进货难。如油盐杂货店需要购进的商品很多，每购进一种商品就得排一次队。很多小商贩反映他们每天大部分时间在“队”里过生活。同时因为资金少，一次不能多进货，只好每天都去排队。如果购买钮扣、卡子等小百货，每次就得购买一箩（批发起点是一箩），够几年销售，因此只好不进这种货。由于这样，这些小商贩的商品品种常常不全，营业因而亏损，全区三十四户百货摊贩，上半年就有二十户亏损。
    今年六月下旬，北京市有关单位组织工作组到西单区进行安排和改造小商贩的工作。在百货、食品杂货、土产食品等行业建立中心店，负责领导小商贩和由小商贩组织的合作小组的业务。规定小商贩进货可以自由选购，不准硬性搭配，同时取消了批发起点，小商贩买多买少，听其自便，并且尽先把主要的或货源困难的货采取送货上门的办法供应小商贩。对小商贩资金有困难的，中心店根据它们的需要代为向银行贷款，还代他们向税务局交纳税收。这些措施给小商贩在经营上以很大的便利。
