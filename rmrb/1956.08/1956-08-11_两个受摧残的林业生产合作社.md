    Two Devastated Forestry Production Cooperatives
    Yu Jiahe Township and Xinqiao Township in Zhangjiabanke District, Macheng County, Hubei Province, are mountainous areas. For decades, farmers in these two townships have relied on income from forestry as an important source of livelihood. However, recently, the two forestry cooperatives in these two townships have lost about 50% of their forestry income.
    In the first half of this year, the Linfeng Forestry Production Cooperative in Xinqiao Township was assigned one hundred Chinese fir trees for use as electric poles. Not only did they not receive a single penny (these fir trees could have been sold for 200-350 yuan in previous years), but they also lost more than two hundred man-days of labor for felling and transporting the wood. The Qingfeng Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yu Jiahe Township was also assigned one hundred and twenty Chinese fir trees, and spent approximately two hundred labor days. Guan Zuoen, the secretary of the CCP Yu Jiahe Township Branch, had raised concerns with the CCP Zhangjiabanke District Committee and the Zhangjiabanke District Office, saying that the cooperative could not afford to bear so much timber. The response he received was: "Failure to complete the task means you have no national concept, no Party member quality... You can choose one of two paths: either complete the task immediately, or pack your bags and go to the District Committee for reflection!"
    Under such crude coercion, the members of the cooperative had no choice but to pick up their axes with tears in their eyes and chop down the fir trees they had painstakingly cultivated. "We might as well just set the forest on fire and burn it all down, so we don't have to cut down all the trees, not get a penny, and still get a bellyful of anger!" The members complained bitterly. Now, the mountain is only left with miscellaneous shrubs and substandard fir trees, with the tops of the fir trees scattered all over the mountains. The fir trees that the farmers had managed for twenty years have been destroyed in this way!
    In addition to allocation, there is also this kind of "purchase." At the beginning of this year (December of the old lunar year), the Muqihe Silk Reeling Factory in Macheng County signed a contract with the Linfeng Forestry Cooperative: to purchase 700 pieces of Chinese fir wood with a small-end diameter of 12 cm and a length of 1.1 or 1.4 zhang at a price of 1.8 yuan and 2.4 yuan. The staff from the silk reeling factory would mark a tree and then it had to be cut down, regardless of the forest's growth situation and the opinions of the cooperative cadres. The cooperative mobilized its main labor force and spent a month and a half cutting down 700 fir trees and transporting them to Muqihe, sixty li away. The cooperative fulfilled the contract, but the silk reeling factory changed its mind: they changed to using "cubic meters" to convert the timber, and reduced the price of the delivered timber to the point where it was not even enough to cover the cost of felling and transporting it. The price stipulated in the contract was already about half the local timber price, and the price calculated according to "cubic meters" was more than half of what was specified in the contract!
    Soon, another forced purchase of timber occurred. The buyer was still the silk reeling factory. The cooperative members did not agree to cut the fir trees, and the township cadres could not persuade the masses. Zhang Baozhong, the district head, issued an order: "You have to cut them down, cut as much as you have. If the cooperative collapses, it has nothing to do with the township branch, I will be responsible." So, Hu Zexiang, the township branch secretary, had to go up the mountain with weapons to "mobilize" the masses. Under the pressure of force, the members cut down 201 fir trees and transported them down the mountain. Who knew that this time the silk reeling factory would not fulfill the contract again: they only purchased one hundred and twenty-nine trees, and the remaining fir trees were scattered on the ground. Of the one hundred and twenty-nine fir trees, four were not paid for, because it was said that one did not meet the specifications, and the receipts for the other three were lost by the Linfeng Forestry Cooperative, so the silk reeling factory did not recognize them. An executive of the Linfeng Cooperative said that these two forced purchases of timber had reduced their income by more than one thousand yuan.
    When we arrived at the Linfeng Cooperative and the Qingfeng Third Cooperative, from the cooperative cadres to the members, from old women to children, they all painfully recounted this illegal behavior. They were thinking about how they would live after losing a large amount of forest resources. We believe that the coercive orders of the personnel concerned should be seriously dealt with, and the losses suffered by the two cooperatives should be reasonably compensated.
    The leading organs of Macheng County have the responsibility to investigate this matter and handle it properly.

    The Living Conditions of State-Owned Ranch Workers in Hulunbuir League Urgently Need Improvement
    In the Hulunbuir Grassland of Inner Mongolia, 12 livestock farms (including more than 30 branch farms) have been established since 1954, with 3,053 employees. These livestock farms have been established for more than a year (a few for two to three years), but most farms do not have family dormitories for employees, and collective dormitories are also insufficient. At the Miandufen Branch of the Yakeshi Dairy Farm, six couples have to take turns living in a small room. The Dayan Stud Farm, which has been established for more than three years, also has five couples who cannot live together because they have no housing.
    Although all farms have established employee cafeterias, the food is not good in most of them. Originally, it is convenient and cheap to buy meat and dairy products here, but meat cannot be eaten in many cafeterias. Although some farms are far from the city and transportation is inconvenient, the ranches have their own cars that regularly (every one to three days) go to Hailar City. Rationally speaking, the employees' food vegetables and daily necessities should be supplied in a timely manner, but I don't know why this has not been resolved well.
    Some farm employees are treated by veterinarians when they are sick. Some farms have poor food, which affects the health of employees, and people are constantly getting sick. For example, at the Yakeshi Dairy Farm, about 10% of employees were frequently sick last winter and this spring. Even less care is given to female employees. Female workers with children have no one to take care of their children, and no one replaces them during their menstrual periods, so they cannot get rest, and as a result, many female workers have gynecological diseases.
    There are also very few cultural and recreational activities for employees. Mobile stores, post offices, bookstores, etc. rarely come to the livestock farms, and newspapers and periodicals are delivered very late. The cultural, political, and theoretical learning of employees is very poor. The schooling of some employees' children has not been resolved.
    I suggest that the local Party committees, governments, and leaders of various livestock farms should pay attention to improving the living and welfare conditions of employees, establish the idea of employees taking the farm as their home, and fully utilize the enthusiasm of all employees.　(Zhang Zhi)

### 两个受摧残的林业生产合作社

    两个受摧残的林业生产合作社
    湖北省麻城县张家畈区余家河乡和新桥乡，是山林地区，这两个乡的农民几十年来都把经营林业的收入作为重要的生活来源。可是，近来这两个乡的两个林业合作社却丧失了50％左右的林业收入。
    今年上半年，新桥乡林峰林业生产合作社，被摊派了一百株作电柱用的杉木，不但得不到一文钱（这些杉木往年可卖200—350元），反而赔出两百多个伐木运木的人工。余家河乡青峰第三农业生产合作社，也被摊派了一百二十株杉木，并且花费大约两百个劳动日。中共余家河乡支部书记关作恩曾经向中共张家畈区委会和张家畈区公所提过意见，说这个合作社负担不了那么多的木材；得到的回答却是：“完不成任务就是没有国家观念，没有党员品质，……两条道路由你挑，或者是马上完成任务，或者是背上行李上区委反省！”
    在粗暴的威迫下，合作社的社员们只好噙着眼泪，拿起斧头向着自己辛勤培育的杉树砍去。“以后干脆放把火把林木烧了好，省得把山砍光了，一文钱得不到，还受一肚子气！”社员们气忿地发出了怨言。现在，这个山上只剩下杂灌木和不合规格的杉木，杉木梢头满山狼籍。农民经营二十年的杉木，就这样遭到了毁灭性的破坏！
    除了摊派以外，还有这样的“收购”。今年年初（旧历去年十二月），麻城县木栖河缫丝厂同林峰林业社订立了合同：以一元八角、二元四角的价格，收购小头直径十二公分、长一丈一尺和一丈四尺的杉木七百件。缫丝厂方面的工作人员号一棵，就得砍一棵，至于森林生长状况和社干部的意见，他是不加考虑的。合作社调动主要劳动力用一个半月的时间把七百棵杉木砍完送到来回六十里的木栖河。合作社是履行了合同了，但是，缫丝厂方面却变了卦：他们又改用“立方公尺”来折算木材，把送去的木材价格压低到连砍伐、运搬的费用都不够的程度。合同规定的价格原来就比当地木材价格低一半左右，而按“立方公尺”折算后的价格又比合同规定的低一半还多！
    不久，又一次强购木材的事情发生了。买主还是缫丝厂。社员群众不同意砍杉木，乡干部也说服不了群众。区长张保忠下了一道命令：“不砍不行，有多少砍多少，社垮了不与乡支部相干，由我负责。”于是乡支书胡泽香只好带着武器上山“动员”群众。在强暴的压力下，社员们把201棵杉木砍倒了，运到了山下。谁知这一次缫丝厂又不履行合同：他们只收购了一百二十九棵，剩下的杉木散丢在地上。一百二十九棵杉木中，又有四棵不给钱，因为据说有一棵不合规格，其他三棵的收条被林峰林业社丢了，缫丝厂不认账。林峰社一位负责干部说：这两次强购木材使他们少收入一千元以上。
    我们到林峰社和青峰三社的时候，从社干部到社员，从老太婆到小孩，都痛心地诉说这件违法行为，他们在想着丧失了大量山林资源以后的日子怎么过。我们认为：有关人员的强迫命令行为应该受到严肃的处理，这两个合作社受到的损失应该得到合理的补偿。
    麻城县的领导机关有责任对于这件事进行检查，并妥善处理。

    呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场职工生活急待改善
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上，从1954年以来已建立了12个畜牧场（包括30多个分场），有职工3，053名。这些畜牧场建场一年多了（少数场二年至三年多了），但是多数场没有职工家属宿舍，集体宿舍也很不够用。牙克石乳牛场免渡分场六对夫妇只能轮流住一间小屋。已建场三年多的大雁种马场，也有五对夫妇因为没有房子不能在一起住。
    各场虽都建立了职工食堂，但多数场伙食搞得不好。本来这里购买肉类、乳品又方便又便宜，但在许多食堂吃不到肉。虽说有的场离城市远，交通不便，但牧场有自己的汽车，经常（一至三天）到海拉尔市去，按理说职工伙食用菜及生活日用品是能够及时供应的，但不知为什么没有很好解决。
    有些场职工患病，也是由兽医给治疗。有些场因为伙食搞得不好，影响职工健康，不断有人患病。如牙克石乳牛场去冬今春经常有10％左右职工患病。对女职工照顾更不够，有孩子的女工，孩子没有人照管，月经期没人替工，得不到休息，因而有不少女工得了妇科病。
    职工文化娱乐活动也很少。流动商店、邮局、书店等也很少来畜牧场，报刊送去很迟。职工学习文化、政策、理论都很差。有些职工子女上学问题也没有解决。
    我建议当地党委、政府和各畜牧场领导人员应重视改善职工生活福利问题，树立职工以场为家的思想，充分发挥出全体职工的积极作用。　（张智）
