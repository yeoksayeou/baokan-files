Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 30th: The work of the Qingdao Legal Advisory Office is welcomed by the citizens. Since its establishment on June 27th until yesterday, the legal advisory office has received 1,123 visitors. These visitors, including people from all walks of life, raised various issues related to debt, marriage, and domestic disputes.

The four lawyers of the legal advisory office, based on the requests of the visitors, provided legal advice to 891 visitors and drafted pleadings for 232 people, basically meeting the needs of the visitors. Wang Qiufang, a citizen who visited, had more than 120 yuan in RMB saved by her husband during his lifetime, which was borrowed by someone else in 1954. However, the debtor later refused to return the money on the pretext of financial difficulties, and she herself did not know how to deal with it. After the lawyer of the legal advisory office analyzed the actual situation, he believed that the debtor was not in financial difficulty but deliberately refused to repay the debt. The lawyer also gave her the advice that she could solve the problem through litigation. Wang Qiufang expressed great satisfaction with the answer provided by the legal advisory office.

The lawyers of the legal advisory office patiently mediated and persuaded the few visitors who made unreasonable claims or had minor disputes, so that they voluntarily no longer sued, thereby reducing the number of cases for the people's courts in various districts. Yi Shenting, a worker from the Qingdao City搬运 company, asked the lawyer to write a divorce petition because his wife was a bit mentally disturbed, but the woman said that she did not agree to the divorce, and there was also a six-month-old child. In accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Law and based on the principle of safeguarding the interests of mothers and children, the lawyer educated Yi Shenting, and finally made Yi Shenting express his willingness to abide by the law and promote family unity, and no longer divorce.

During this period, due to the expansion of the influence of the legal advisory office, not only did the number of visitors in the second month in Qingdao increase by more than half compared with the first month, but also some people from other places wrote letters or came to inquire about matters, asking for help in solving difficult problems.

The legal advisory office is now preparing to carry out criminal defense work.

    为各阶层的来访者解决各种问题
    青岛法律顾问处受到群众欢迎
    新华社青岛30日电　青岛市法律顾问处的工作受到市民群众的欢迎。这个法律顾问处从6月27日成立起到昨天为止已经接待了一千一百二十三个来访者。这些包括社会各阶层的来访者向法律顾问处提出了有关债务、婚姻、家务纠纷等各种各样的问题。
    法律顾问处的四位律师根据来访人的请求，向八百九十一个来访者提供了有关法律方面的意见，为二百三十二人代写了诉状，基本上满足了来访者的要求。来访的市民王秋芳的丈夫生前劳动积蓄的人民币一百二十多元，在1954年被别人借用，但是后来债务人却借口生活困难不肯归还，她自己也不知道应该怎样处理。经过法律顾问处律师根据实际情况的分析，认为债务人并非生活困难而是有意不还债。律师并且给她提供了可以通过起诉的办法去解决问题的意见。王秋芳对法律顾问处的解答表示非常满意。
    法律顾问处的律师们对于来访者中的少数属于无理追诉或一些细小纠纷问题都耐心地进行调解说服，使来访者自愿不再起诉，从而给各个区人民法院减少了案件。青岛市搬运公司工人依慎亭因为他的妻子神经有点失常要求律师代他写离婚诉状，可是女方表示不同意离婚，并且又有个刚生下来六个月的孩子。律师按照婚姻法的规定和本着维护母子利益的原则，向依慎亭进行了教育，最后使依慎亭表示愿意遵守法律搞好家庭团结，不再离婚。
    在这一期间，由于法律顾问处工作影响的扩大，不仅是青岛市第二个月来访的人数比头一个月增加了半倍多，同时还有一部分外地群众来信询问或前来问事，要求帮助解决疑难问题。
    现在这个法律顾问处正在准备开展刑事辩护工作。
