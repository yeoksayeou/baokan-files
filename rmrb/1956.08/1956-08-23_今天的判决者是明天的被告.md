The despicable conspiracy in Karlsruhe has been fully exposed. After manufacturing a series of "trials" and persecutions against the German Communist Party, the Adenauer government brazenly directed the Federal Constitutional Court to illegally declare the German Communist Party illegal, and began the most wanton provocation against the democratic and progressive forces in West Germany. It is now very clear that the Adenauer group, revanchists, and militarists are re-enacting the historical events of 1933, following Hitler's path, and making West Germany a new source of war.

The main "crime" alleged against the German Communist Party is that it published the "Program of the German Communist Party for the Restoration of German National Unity" in 1952. This program calls for free all-German elections and the restoration of Germany as a united, democratic, peace-loving, and independent nation. This makes it very clear what position the Adenauer government is in in court. It has always posed as the defender of the cause of German reunification, but in reality it is the enemy of German reunification. As the representative of the German Communist Party exposed in court, the Adenauer government's purpose in banning the German Communist Party is precisely to deepen the division and create new and serious obstacles to German reunification.

In order to cover up its criminal activities, Adenauer's representatives used the most shameful means to distort and slander the policies of the German Communist Party and Marxist doctrines, thereby falsely accusing the German Communist Party of being "unconstitutional" and even adding "treason." However, this old weapon taken from the "anti-communist" arsenal cannot improve the position of the fabricators and slanderers. The party documents, publications, brochures, and leaflets submitted by the German Communist Party to the court eloquently prove that the activities called for by the German Communist Party are to safeguard the democratic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and to be loyal to the cause of peace and the interests of the German nation. In this regard, it is Adenauer's persecution and "trials" of the German Communist Party, and Adenauer's policies of dividing Germany and rearming, that truly violate the law and the Constitution.

The Potsdam Agreement stipulates the "basic democratic order" of Germany and its peaceful unification. The West German Constitution also affirms this provision. Therefore, any force that complies with and abides by the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement should be guaranteed by democracy; any political party that does not violate the Potsdam Agreement cannot be declared "unconstitutional." The German Communist Party is precisely such a force, such a party, and it should be guaranteed and respected by the Potsdam Agreement and the West German Constitution, and should not be subjected to any persecution. The International Commission of Jurists composed of famous jurists from France, Italy, Britain, Denmark and other countries pointed out in its investigation report that declaring the German Communist Party illegal violates the Potsdam Agreement and will have very dangerous consequences for easing international tensions. But the Adenauer government openly disregarded this fact, and its representatives publicly declared in court that the various provisions of the Potsdam Agreement were not valid for the Federal Republic. This is a blatant act of violating the Constitution and undermining international agreements.

The Adenauer government's reckless and illegal action was carried out under the instigation and encouragement of Washington. The year or so from the "trial" to the banning of the German Communist Party was the period of planning the Paris Agreement, dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and starting to build a 500,000-strong German army, which shows the relationship between the two and the international background of the action to ban the German Communist Party. In fact, the United States also directly participated in Adenauer's anti-peace and democratic conspiracy. The US High Commissioner to West Germany, Conant, held talks with the West German Minister of the Interior to discuss preparations, and told Adenauer that the US State Department believed that banning the Communist Party was the most important prerequisite for rearming West Germany. The United States also sent a large number of "lawyers" to Karlsruhe to "study" the entire process of the "trial."

Today, the most tyrannical and large-scale plans to persecute Communists and other democratic progressive forces are being implemented in both the United States and West Germany. The notorious McCarthyist persecution has intensified. After the recent fascist attack by the United States, under the pretext of tax arrears, to seal up the organs and newspapers of the American Communist Party failed, new steps are being taken to force the American Communist Party to register with the government. These two largest political undercurrents from Washington and Bonn show that the anti-peace and democratic policies pursued by international reactionary forces are becoming increasingly unpopular, and the formulators and implementers of these policies are becoming increasingly isolated, and therefore urgently need to destroy the basic rights of the people and provoke the cause of peace and democracy. It is no accident that international reactionary forces chose West Germany as a pilot site. There is a deep militarist tradition there, and the strength of the working class there has been weakened because the leaders of the Social Democratic Party have adopted a harmful and passive attitude towards the reactionary anti-peace and democratic conspiracy. Today, this latter fact particularly emphasizes to the West German working class the importance of uniting actions regardless of party affiliations, in order to unite forces to push back the anti-peace and democratic undercurrents.

However, international reactionary forces clearly underestimated the fighting will of the West German working class and other peace and democratic forces. There is a strong people's movement in West Germany. The persecution in Karlsruhe cannot provide any comfort to the reactionary forces. Resistance to militarism and rearmament is growing. The West German working class and people launched a widespread movement against the "trial" of the German Communist Party. Last July, the German Communist Party submitted to the court a petition signed by more than 23,000 people demanding that the German Communist Party not be banned, and 500 telegrams from abroad expressing the same demand. People's petition delegations flocked to Karlsruhe, and protest letters flew to the court from all over West Germany. In recent days, mass demonstrations condemning and protesting the banning of the German Communist Party in various parts of West Germany have once again shown that the strength of West Germany in defending peace, democracy, and striving for national unity is strong.

"The German Communist Party will continue to exist," is the German Communist Party's powerful response to the fascist ban. The German working class has a long revolutionary tradition. As early as 1869, the German Social Democratic Workers' Party led by Liebknecht was established and joined the First International. After the official establishment of the German Communist Party in 1918, the path it has taken has been tortuous and difficult, but also glorious and great. Bismarck's anti-socialist laws failed to stifle the German working class party. Hitler's bloody terror could not eliminate the German Communist Party or prevent the growth of German peace, democracy, and socialist forces. On the contrary, Bismarck's rule disappeared, Hitler's tyranny was destroyed, but the German Communist Party continued to exist and develop. The communist doctrine, which originated from the German workers' movement and was founded by Marx and Engels, is increasingly shining on Germany and the world. Since the end of World War II, the Communists in eastern Germany merged with the Social Democrats to form the German Socialist Unity Party, leading the increasingly powerful German Democratic Republic. In western Germany, the German Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of the struggle for peace, democracy, and a unified Germany, against the division policies of the US and West German reactionaries, and against the revival of German militarism. Times are advancing, and although the Adenauer group is still maintaining its rule, its position is already precarious, and they can never do what Hitler and his tyranny failed to do.

In the court in Karlsruhe, the German Communist Party heroically defended Marxist doctrine and the policy principles of the German Communist Party, and held high the bright banner of safeguarding peace, democracy, and striving for German unity. The Adenauer government and its Washington supporters want to rely on the method of banning the advanced ranks of the West German working class to make the West German people lose their leadership and weaken the West German democratic and progressive forces. This is impossible to achieve. The German Communist Party is closely linked to the West German working class and represents the interests of the working class and the people. They will continue to lead the West German working class and the people forward, and they will surely be able to block the path of the reactionaries. Today's judges will be tomorrow's defendants. Tomorrow, the people's judgment on today's judges will be truly irresistible.

    今天的判决者是明天的被告

    在卡尔斯卢厄进行的卑鄙阴谋，完全暴露出来了。阿登纳政府在制造一系列对德国共产党的“审讯”和迫害以后，悍然指使联邦宪法法院非法宣布德国共产党非法，开始向西德民主进步力量进行最放肆的挑衅。人们现在可以看得非常清楚，阿登纳集团、复仇主义者和军国主义分子正在重演1933年的历史事件，走上希特勒当年的道路，使西德重新成为新战争的策源地。
    对德国共产党提出控诉的主要“罪名”，是它曾经在1952年发表“德国共产党争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领”。这个纲领要求举行全德自由选举和把德国恢复成为一个统一的民主的爱好和平的独立国家。这就很清楚，阿登纳政府在法庭上所处的究竟是什么地位。它曾一直以德国重新统一事业的卫护者自居，实际上它是德国重新统一的仇人。正如德国共产党代表在法庭上所揭发的，阿登纳政府禁止德国共产党的目的，恰恰在于加深分裂，为德国的重新统一制造新的严重障碍。
    为了掩饰自己的罪恶活动，阿登纳的代表使用了最可耻的手段，大肆歪曲和诽谤德国共产党的政策和马克思主义学说，借此诬蔑德共“违宪”，甚至加以“叛国罪”。但是，这种从“反共”武器库中搬出来的陈旧武器，丝毫不能改善捏造者和诽谤者的地位。德国共产党向法庭提出的党的文件、刊物、小册子和传单，雄辩地证明了德国共产党所号召进行的活动，是维护宪法所保障的民主自由权利，忠于和平和德国民族利益的事业的。在这方面，真正违反法律和宪法的，是阿登纳所组织的对德国共产党的迫害和“审讯”，是阿登纳所执行的分裂德国和重新武装的政策。
    波茨坦协定规定了德国的“基本的民主秩序”和它的和平统一。西德宪法也肯定了这个规定。因此，任何一种力量，只要符合和遵守波茨坦协定的规定，就应该得到民主的保障；任何一个政党，如果不违背波茨坦协定，就不能被宣布为“违宪”。德国共产党正是这样的一种力量、这样的一个政党，它应该受到波茨坦协定和西德宪法的保障和尊重，而不应受到任何迫害。由法国、意大利、英国、丹麦和其他国家著名法学家组成的国际法学家委员会在调查报告中指出，宣布德国共产党非法是违反波茨坦协定的，并且对缓和国际紧张局势，将产生十分危险的后果。但阿登纳政府公然漠视这个事实，它的代表竟在法庭上公开声明：波茨坦协定的各项条款对于联邦共和国没有效力。这是一种明目张胆地违反宪法和破坏国际协议的行为。
    阿登纳政府这个不顾一切的非法行动，是在华盛顿的主使和怂恿下进行的。从“审讯”到禁止德国共产党的一年多，正是策划巴黎协定，把西德拉入北大西洋公约组织和开始建立五十万德国军队的时期，这就说明了两者之间的关系和取缔德国共产党的行动的国际背景。事实上，美国还直接参预了阿登纳的这次反和平民主阴谋。美国驻西德高级专员康南特曾同西德内政部长举行会谈，商谈准备工作，并告诉阿登纳说：美国国务院认为，取缔共产党是重新武装西德最重要的先决条件。美国还派遣了大批“律师”到卡尔斯卢厄，“研究”整个“审讯”的进程。
    今天，在美国和西德都在实行着最专横的最大规模的迫害共产党和其他民主进步力量的计划。臭名远扬的麦卡锡主义的迫害有加无已。美国最近借口欠税查封美国共产党机关和报纸的法西斯袭击遭到失败以后，正在继续采取新的步骤，强迫美国共产党向政府登记。来自华盛顿和波恩的这两股最大的政治逆流，表明国际反动势力所奉行的反和平民主的政策，越来越不得人心，这种政策的制定者和执行人日益陷于孤立，因而急需摧残人民的基本权利，对和平民主事业进行挑衅。国际反动势力选择了西德这块地方作为试点，这不是偶然的。那里有着深厚军国主义传统，并且那里的工人阶级力量因为社会民主党领袖对反动派的反和平民主的阴谋采取有害的消极态度而受到削弱。这后面的一个事实今天特别向西德工人阶级强调了摒除党派之见而团结行动的重要性，以便把力量联合起来推回反和平民主的逆流。
    但是，国际反动势力显然低估了西德工人阶级和其他和平民主力量的战斗意志。在西德有着强大的人民运动。卡尔斯卢厄的迫害，丝毫不能给反动势力提供任何慰籍。对军国主义和重新武装的反抗日益增长。西德工人阶级和人民曾发动了广泛的反对“审讯”德国共产党的运动。去年七月，德国共产党就曾把由两万三千余人签名的要求不要禁止德共的请愿书和来自国外的表达同样要求的五百封电报交给了法院。人民的请愿代表团纷纷涌到卡尔斯卢厄，抗议书从西德各地飞向法院。这些天来，西德各地谴责和抗议禁止德国共产党的群众示威，再一次显示了西德保卫和平、民主和争取国家统一的力量是强大的。
    “德国共产党将存在下去”，这是德国共产党对法西斯禁令的有力回答。德国工人阶级具有悠久的革命传统。远在1869年，李卜克内西领导的德国社会民主工党成立了，并加入了第一国际。1918年德国共产党正式成立后，它走过的道路是曲折的，艰难的，但也是光荣的和伟大的。俾斯麦的反社会主义法律，未能扼杀德国工人阶级的政党。希特勒的血腥恐怖，也不能消灭德国共产党，阻止德国和平民主和社会主义力量的增长。相反地，俾斯麦的统治消失了，希特勒的暴政毁灭了，但是，德国共产党继续存在并且发展了。起源于德国工人运动，为马克思和恩格斯所创立的共产主义学说，日益光辉地照耀着德国和全世界。第二次世界大战结束以来，德国东部地区的共产党人同社会民主党人合并成了德国统一社会党，领导着日益强大地发展着的德意志民主共和国。在德国西部地区，德国共产党一直站在争取和平民主和统一德国、反对美国和西德反动派的分裂政策、反对重新复活德国军国主义的斗争的最前列。时代在前进，阿登纳集团虽然还维持着统治，但其地位已经岌岌可危，他们决不可能做到希特勒和他的暴政所未曾做到的事情。
    德国共产党在卡尔斯卢厄的法庭上，英勇地捍卫了马克思主义学说和德国共产党的政策原则，高高地举起维护和平、民主和争取德国统一的鲜明旗帜。阿登纳政府和它的华盛顿支持者想依靠取缔西德工人阶级先进队伍的方法，使西德人民失掉领导，削弱西德民主进步力量，这是不可能达到目的的。德国共产党同德国工人阶级血肉相连，代表着工人阶级和人民的利益，他们将继续领导西德工人阶级和人民前进，他们一定能堵塞反动派的道路。今天的判决者将是明天的被告。明天，人民对今天的判决者的判决，才是真正不可抗拒的。
