Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 23rd. At 3:00 AM today, the water level of the Songhua River in Harbin was 119.21 meters, 9 centimeters below the guaranteed water level. This indicates that the most critical period of the flood threat to Harbin has passed, but the flood level is still above the warning level.

The Harbin Flood Control Headquarters, based on the drop in water level and the near completion of flood control projects, has successively withdrawn workers and cadres who participated in dike construction. Currently, the more than 30,000 flood control personnel participating are continuing to complete the eastern dike project and strengthening patrol work along the dikes.

    洪水威胁哈尔滨市的最危急时期已经过去
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　今天三时，哈尔滨市江面水位为一百一十九点二一公尺，比保证水位低九公分。这表明洪水威胁哈尔滨市的最危急时期已经过去，但洪水水位仍在警戒水位以上。
    哈尔滨市防汛指挥部根据水位下落和防汛工程接近收尾的情况，将参加修堤的职工和机关干部陆续撤回，现在参加防汛的三万多防汛人员一面继续完成东部堤坝工程，一面加强堤坝的巡逻工作。
