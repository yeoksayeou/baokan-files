    Marching Towards Science Needs Support
    Please Produce Experimental Equipment for Us
    We, the teachers and graduate students of the Physics Department of Peking University, have encountered serious difficulties in carrying out scientific research: we cannot buy experimental materials anywhere, and we cannot order experimental instruments anywhere.
    The Solid State Physics Teaching and Research Section spent three months trying to order an "electromagnet." First, the Beijing Local Industry Bureau assigned the work to the Beijing Electric Company. People at the Electric Company said, "This work has too many mechanical parts and belongs to the Mechanical Company." At the Mechanical Company, the Mechanical Company said, "This is an electromagnet, and should be made by the Electric Company." We ran to many factories, and they all said that the accuracy requirements were too high, and they would not do it. The Electronics Teaching and Research Section entrusted Nankai University to order several thousand "resistors" from a factory in Tianjin. The factory made some on a trial basis, but because the specifications did not meet the requirements, they were asked to redo them. They were unwilling to do it again, saying, "Your specifications are too strict. Making one resistor that you want can make several ordinary resistors."
    The reasons for this phenomenon are nothing more than two: one is that the production units all produce according to the plan, so they reject the "scattered and detailed work" required by various research institutions and schools; the other is that the production units have to consider costs and profits, and the materials and instruments we need are small in quantity and strict in requirements, which are not as profitable as making other products, thus forming a situation where you can't buy what you want, and you can't make what you want to make. This is very detrimental to our task of catching up with the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years.
    In order to solve this problem, we suggest that relevant central departments study some measures, such as reserving a certain amount of production tasks in the production plans of state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, specifically to serve scientific research work; or organizing several institutions to specifically solve the production problems of instruments and materials needed in scientific research work. At the same time, we also hope that various enterprise departments can understand the special requirements of scientific research and provide special convenience, and work together to develop my country's scientific undertakings.

    Scientific Instruments Must Be Precise and Accurate
    I am a veterinary scientist. I would like to make some comments on the production of scientific instruments. At present, not only is the number of scientific instruments we use insufficient, but the quality of some instruments is also very poor. For example, veterinary surgical instruments and obstetrical instruments cannot be bought at all; veterinary injection needles manufactured in Shanghai often break at the base of the needle, and some instruments are very inaccurate. Take a type of thermometer manufactured in Shanghai, for example. Among the twenty I tested, they were divided into seven grades, with a maximum difference of 2.7 degrees Celsius, and it is impossible to tell which one is accurate. In addition, various graduated pipettes are also inaccurate, and the sensitivity of the balance is very inflexible.
    There is no doubt that such inaccurate scientific instruments have a great impact on our scientific research work. I hope that factories manufacturing scientific instruments will manufacture some precise and accurate instruments to promote my country's science to catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible.

    向科学进军需要支援
    请给我们生产实验器材
    我们北京大学物理系的教师和研究生，在开展科学研究工作中，遇到了严重的困难：要购买实验材料，到处买不到，要订购实验仪器，到处不肯做。
    固体物理教研室为了定作“电磁铁”，奔波了三个月。先由北京地方工业局把这工作分配到北京电器公司，电器公司的人说：“这工作机械部分太多，属于机械公司。”到机械公司，机械公司又说：“这是电磁铁，由电器公司做。”我们又跑了许多工厂，他们都说精确度要求高，不给做。电子学教研室托南开大学向天津一个工厂定制几千个“电阻”，工厂试作了一些，因为规格不合，要他们重做，他们就不愿意再做，说：“你们要求规格太严，做一个你们要的电阻，可以作好几个普通电阻。”
    发生这种现象的原因，不外乎两个：一个是生产单位都按计划生产，因此，对于各研究机关、学校要求做的“零星细活”就推之门外；另一个原因是各生产单位要考虑成本、利润，而我们需要的材料、仪器数量少、要求严格，不如做其他产品利润大，因此形成要买买不到，要做做不成的局面。这对我们在十二年之内把我国科学赶上世界先进的水平的任务是十分不利的。
    为了解决这个问题，我们建议中央有关部门研究一些措施，例如在国营和公私合营企业的生产计划中，保留一定数量的生产任务，专门为科学研究工作服务；或者组织若干机构，专门解决科学研究工作中所需要的仪器和材料的生产问题。同时，我们也希望各企业部门，能谅解到科学研究的特殊要求，给予特殊便利，共同努力来发展我国的科学事业。

    科学仪器必须精密准确
    我是一个兽医科学工作者。我要对科学仪器的生产工作提些意见。现在我们所用的科学仪器，不但样数不足，有些仪器的质量也很低劣，例如兽医外科用具和产科用具根本买不到；上海制造的兽用注射针头常在针的根部折断，还有些仪器十分不准确。就拿上海制造的一种体温计来说吧，在我测验的二十个当中，就分七等，最大之差为摄氏二点七度，说不清究竟哪个准确。另外各种刻度吸管也不准确，天秤灵敏度极不灵活。
    这样不准确的科学仪器，毫无疑问，对我们的科学研究工作，是有很大影响的。希望制造科学仪器的工厂，制造出一些精密而准确的仪器，以促使我国科学早日赶上世界先进水平。
