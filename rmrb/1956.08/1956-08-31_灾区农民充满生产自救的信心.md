Farmers in Disaster Areas are Full of Confidence in Self-Reliance Through Production
Most of the Autumn Fields in Disaster-Stricken Shanxi Have Been Replanted or Modified

Since summer, 92 counties and cities in Shanxi Province have suffered from varying degrees of wind, hail, and flood disasters. More than 7.04 million mu of autumn fields were affected. At present, most of these farmlands, except for a few still flooded, have been promptly supported with seedlings, replanted, or modified. In the Xingxian area, agricultural cooperatives replanted and modified more than 150,000 mu of late autumn crops in eight days, and all the fallen crops were raised. The Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingyuan County, which suffered continuous disasters, had more than 80% of its autumn fields affected. The cooperative mobilized its members to rush to support and replant, and now most of the corn and millet have been hoeed once, and all the broken stalks of paddy fields have been replanted with radishes and autumn barley.

Agricultural cooperatives in various disaster areas have received active support from agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas during the rescue and disaster relief efforts. After the Tianjiahui and Yinmahui villages in Xingxian County, northwestern Shanxi, suffered disasters, six nearby agricultural cooperatives, including Guxian, immediately organized more than 130 young and middle-aged people and skilled workers, 75 livestock, and carried 2,000 jin of seeds to help them replant the disaster-stricken farmland.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee and other units also organized condolence groups to visit the seriously affected areas door-to-door and distributed a large number of quilts, cotton clothes, stoves, relief grain, and house repair funds to help the affected farmers rebuild their homes. Local banks also issued a batch of production loans specifically to support affected farmers in restoring production.

Ascertaining the Extent of the Disaster, Finding Solutions, Thinking of Ways, and Making Plans
Farmers in Hebei Disaster Areas are in High Spirits for Production and Overcoming Difficulties

The grassroots Party organizations in rural disaster areas of Hebei Province are ascertaining the extent of the disaster, finding solutions, thinking of ways, and making plans to help the disaster victims build up confidence in self-reliance through production and promote the movement of self-reliance through production.

The CCP branches in various townships and cooperatives in Quzhou County, Handan Prefecture, have helped 180 cooperatives formulate comprehensive plans for self-reliance through production and frugality by ascertaining the disaster situation, finding solutions, and mobilizing members to calculate income and expenses. After the CCP branch of Xihhezhuang Village in Yongnian County helped the Wuai Agricultural Cooperative make a production plan to overcome difficulties, it also helped more than 70% of the members make family production self-reliance plans.

Under the leadership of the CCP rural party organizations, agricultural cooperatives have made specific calculations and formulated plans for self-reliance through production, many agricultural cooperative members have a clear understanding of production and overcoming difficulties, and self-reliance production activities have gradually been carried out. Township and cooperative party organizations in Boye and Anxin counties in Baoding Prefecture have led 50,000 members of agricultural cooperatives to engage in more than 20 kinds of sideline production. In Dawangfu Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wuqing County, Tianjin Prefecture, 870 mu of the 900 mu of crops were flooded. Some members were so worried that they lay on the kangs and did not go out. After the CCP village branch led the agricultural cooperative to formulate a comprehensive production plan to overcome difficulties, the members felt that they had a way to overcome difficulties, their enthusiasm for production was high, and they immediately engaged in sideline production such as weaving mats, using wooden boats for transportation, and cutting grass. In twenty days, they earned a net income of 120 yuan.

A Large Number of Living and Production Materials
Are Transported from Tianjin to Various Disaster Areas

Tianjin is transporting a large number of living and production materials to the flood-stricken areas. Hundreds of motorized and wooden boats coming and going at the Dahongqiao Wharf are loaded with rice, flour, salt, medicine, building materials, vegetables, and other flood prevention and disaster relief materials, and are transported along the Ziya, Daqing, and South Canal to the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau also has special trains for transporting disaster relief materials, which are given priority and are not subject to planning restrictions. As of the 29th, 7.5 million jin of grain had been transported to Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province.

In order to support the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province in self-reliance through production, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee has decided to transport 10,000 jin of raw silk for weaving fishing nets, 60,000 jin of ramie, and a large number of tung oil for oil boats and bamboo poles for punting boats. The Tianjin commercial departments have also transferred more than 16,800 tons of fertilizer in advance to supply farmers in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong with topdressing to save late autumn crops and replant Chinese cabbage.

The China Pharmaceutical Company Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station has recently dispatched medicines worth 45,000 yuan to the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province. The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Pharmaceutical Factory completed the monthly plan for making anti-inflammatory tablets two days ahead of schedule in order to meet the urgent needs of farmers in the disaster areas. 1,860 bottles of 1,000-tablet anti-inflammatory tablets were transported to Hebei on the 28th.

Disaster Areas in Jilin Launch Activities to Increase Production, Ensure Harvests, and Develop Sideline Production

Disaster victims in flood-stricken areas of Jilin Province have been properly resettled, and activities for self-reliance through production have been launched.

All counties in disaster-stricken areas are taking the lead in organizing disaster victims to carry out self-reliance production activities as the current central task. Dehui County has already organized disaster victims to carry out eight sideline production activities such as fishing and weaving. The CCP General Branch Committee of Panjialing, Yanjia, and Pingfang townships, which were severely affected in Nong'an County, led the affected agricultural cooperatives to calculate three accounts: agricultural and sideline income accounts, labor surplus and shortage accounts, and horse grass and feed surplus and shortage accounts. After that, they formulated a self-reliance production plan, which increased the confidence of farmers in self-reliance through production. After calculation, the members of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Pingfang Township knew that they could still harvest more than one million jin of grain, and there would be no problem with food for the coming year. Their confidence in self-reliance through production was enhanced, so they actively launched activities such as increasing production, ensuring harvests, and developing sideline production. Many agricultural cooperatives that were less affected by the disaster have strengthened field management after drainage in order to strive for increased production and ensure harvests. At present, except for a small amount of crops that cannot be restored, most crops are expected to have a good harvest. In order to make up for the losses caused by the disaster, many agricultural cooperatives are currently rushing to plant autumn vegetables.

The affected counties are also trying to help disaster victims solve the problem of self-reliance in production. Shulan, Nong'an, and other counties have organized more than 5,000 disaster victims to work as temporary workers in the forestry industry and basic construction departments.

Xixian County Strives to Eliminate Famine in the Autumn

Currently, in Xixian County, Henan Province, 10 out of every 100 laborers are engaged in sideline production activities centered on self-reliance through production. Through this sideline production, more than 19,000 disaster-stricken farming households in the county have obtained all the food rations needed to overcome the famine; the food shortage problems of more than 15,000 other households have also been partially solved.

According to the plan of the Xixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the income from sideline production in the county will reach more than 2 million yuan in the second half of this year, and efforts will be made to eliminate famine in the county in the autumn. At present, 53 agricultural cooperatives in the county have established or improved a system for regular distribution of sideline income.

In the past month alone, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county have distributed more than 130,000 yuan in sideline income to their members. About half of the townships have had sideline income ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 yuan since the disaster.

700 Million Jin of Seeds Transported to Disaster Areas to Support Agricultural Production

Seven hundred and twenty million jin of seeds needed to support agricultural production in areas in Anhui, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces affected by floods and typhoons are being actively organized and transported from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Tianjin and other places.

The vast majority of the seeds transferred to the disaster areas are wheat seeds, of which a large proportion are improved varieties. It is understood that the 470 million jin of wheat seeds transferred from Sichuan and Shaanxi are the nationally famous "Nanda 2419" and "Bima No. 1". In addition to wheat seeds, the seeds allocated by various regions also include late autumn crop seeds such as buckwheat and mung beans.

In order to avoid infection with diseases and insect pests, agricultural departments and agricultural science experiment stations in various regions have paid attention to the inspection of seeds transferred from other places; and have conducted research on the problems in the introduction of seeds, and put forward specific measures.

Because of the large quantity of seeds transferred between provinces this time, the short time, and the long transportation lines, the agricultural and grain departments in various regions have established full-time seed transfer agencies to strengthen the leadership of this work; at the same time, all transportation departments across the country have given priority to all consigned crop seeds.

    灾区农民充满生产自救的信心
    山西受灾秋田大部补种改种完毕
    夏季以来，山西省有九十二个县、市遭受不同程度的大风、冰雹和洪水灾害。遭灾的秋田有七百零四万多亩。目前，这些农田除少数仍有积水外，大部分都及时进行了扶苗、补种和改种。兴县地区农业社，在八天当中就改种和补种了十五万多亩晚秋作物，并将受灾倒伏的作物全部扶起。连续遭灾的平顺县西沟乡金星农林牧生产合作社，有80％以上的秋田受了灾，这个社发动社员抢扶抢种，现已将大部玉米、谷子锄了一遍，打断秆茎的田禾全部改种成萝卜和秋大麦。
    各地受灾农业社，在抢险、抗灾中受到非灾区农业社的积极支援。晋西北兴县田家会、饮马会两村遭灾后，附近数十里的固县等六个农业社立即组织一百三十多个青、壮年和技术能手，七十五头牲口，并携带种籽两千斤，协助他们把遭灾的耕地加以改种。
    山西省人民委员会等单位还组织了慰问团到重灾区挨门逐户进行慰问，并发给灾民大批的被褥、棉衣、灶具、救济粮、修房费，帮助受灾农民重建家园。各地银行也发放了一批生产贷款，专门扶持受灾农民恢复生产。
    摸灾底、找门路、想办法、订计划
    河北灾民生产渡荒情绪高涨
    中共河北省灾区农村基层党组织正在摸灾底、找门路、想办法、订计划，帮助灾民树立生产自救信心，推动生产自救运动。
    邯郸专区曲周县各乡、社的中共支部，已经用摸灾情、找门路和发动社员算收入算开支等办法，帮助一百八十个社订出了生产自救节约渡荒的全面计划。永年县西何庄村党支部，帮助五爱农业社作出生产渡荒计划后，又帮助70％以上的社员作了家庭生产自救计划。
    在中共农村党组织领导农业社具体算账订出生产自救计划的情况下，很多农业社社员对生产渡荒心中有了底，生产自救活动也逐渐开展起来。保定专区博野、安新两县乡、社党组织已领导农业社五万名社员经营起二十多种副业生产。天津专区武清县大王甫村农业社九百亩庄稼被淹了八百七十亩，有些社员愁的躺在炕上不出门。经中共村支部领导农业社订出全面生产渡荒计划后，社员们感到有了渡荒的办法，生产情绪高涨，立即经营起编席、使用木船运输和打草等副业生产。二十天即挣得纯收入一百二十元。
    大批生活和生产资料
    从天津运往各灾区
    天津市正把大批的生活和生产资料源源运往水灾地区。来往在大红桥码头的数百只机船和木船，每天满载着米面、食盐、药品、建筑器材、菜蔬等防汛救灾物资，沿着子牙、大清、南运河，运往河北、山东、河南的受灾地区。天津铁路分局也设有运输救灾物资的专车，对救灾物资优先处理，不受计划限制。到29日止，仅运往河北省天津专区的粮食已有七百五十万斤。
    天津市人民委员会为了支援河北省受灾地区生产自救，已决定运去织渔网用的生丝一万斤，苎麻六万斤和大批油船的桐油、撑船的竹杆等。天津市商业部门还提前调拨了一万六千八百多吨肥田粉，供给河北、河南、山东水灾地区的农民追肥挽救晚秋作物和补种大白菜等。
    中国医药公司天津采购供应站，最近发往河北省受灾地区的药品，价值四万五千元。国营天津制药厂的工人们，为了满足灾区农民的急用，提前两天完成了制作消炎片的月计划，一千八百六十瓶千片装的消炎片，已在28日运往河北。吉林灾区展开增产保收和副业生产活动
    吉林省遭受水灾地区的灾民已经得到妥善安置，灾民生产自救的活动已经展开。
    各县受灾地区都把领导灾民开展生产自救活动作为当前的中心工作，德惠县已经组织灾民展开了打鱼、编织等八项副业生产。农安县受重灾的潘家岭、阎家、平房等乡的中共总支委员会，领导受灾的农业社算了农副业收入账、劳动力余缺账、马草马料余缺账等三笔账以后，订立了生产自救计划，增加了农民生产自救的信心。平房乡东方红农业社的社员们，经过算账，知道还能打一百多万斤粮食，明年一年的吃粮不成问题，生产自救的信心增强了，因此积极地展开了增产保收和副业生产等活动。受灾害较轻的许多农业社，在排水以后，都加强了田间管理，争取增产保收，现在除少量庄稼不能恢复外，大部庄稼可望丰收。为了弥补灾害造成的损失，当前，不少农业社正突击抢种秋菜。
    各受灾县还设法帮助灾民解决生产自救的出路问题。舒兰、农安等县已经组织五千多灾民到森林工业部门和基本建设部门去作临时工。
    息县争取把灾荒消灭在秋季
    当前，河南省息县农村在每一百个劳动力中，就有十个人投入了以生产自救为中心的副业生产活动。通过这段副业生产，全县已有一万九千多户被灾农户，得到了渡荒的全部口粮；另有一万五千多户的缺粮问题也得到了部分的解决。
    根据中共息县委员会的规划，今年下半年全县的副业生产收益要达到二百多万元，并且争取把全县灾荒消灭在秋季。现在，全县已经有五十三个农业社建立或健全了定期分配副业收益的制度。
    全县各农业社仅在最近一个月里，已把十三万多元的副业收益分给了社员。约占半数的乡，自从受灾到现在，副业收益已达一千元到六千元。
    七亿斤种子运往灾区支援农业生产
    支援安徽、河北、江苏、浙江、河南等省遭受水涝和台风等灾害地区农业生产需用的七亿二千万斤种子，正积极从四川、陕西、湖北、天津等地组织调运。
    以上调运灾区的种子绝大部分是小麦种，其中良种占很大比重。据了解，从四川、陕西外调的四亿七千万斤麦种是全国著名的“南大二四一九”和“碧蚂一号”。各地调拨的种子除小麦种以外，其他还有荞麦、绿豆等晚秋作物种子。
    为了免除病、虫害的感染，各地农业部门及农业科学试验站，都注意了外调种子的检验工作；并且对引种中的问题进行了研究，提出了具体措施。
    这次省际之间调拨种子由于数量大、时间短、调运线路长，因此，各地农业、粮食部门都成立了专职的种子调拨机构，加强了对这一工作的领导；同时，全国各交通部门对所有托运的农作物种子，也都予以优先承运。　（据新华社讯）
