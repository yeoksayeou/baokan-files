　　In Front of "Deadlines"
　　Zhong Huai

　　This spring, the Yangchun County Committee in Guangdong Province, in order to complete the sowing work early, issued orders to lower levels more than once, some of which were virtually on a tight schedule: "Be sure to soak all the grain seeds by the vernal equinox," "Limit to tonight (vernal equinox) to soak all the grain seeds, otherwise it will be regarded as dereliction of duty." To complete the plan of increasing peanut planting, after the Qingming Festival, the Yangchun County Committee issued instructions one after another: "Complete the task 100% no matter what," "Reclamation must also complete the task." Obviously, these "deadlines" of the Yangchun County Committee were highly subjective and coercive, violated the leadership principle of "adapting to local conditions and providing specific guidance," and were very likely to foster the commandism of the lower levels.

　　Here, we will not study the shortcomings and errors in the leadership style of the Yangchun County Committee for the time being. Let's take a look at how the following cadres implemented these "deadlines," which is very helpful for us to understand how to correctly treat the instructions of higher authorities.

　　The cadres of the Fu Chengxiang Gao Long Agricultural Cooperative, after receiving the instruction of "limit to tonight to soak all the grain seeds," considered the past lessons of setting a deadline for soaking seeds which resulted in sprouted rice, and suspected whether this "deadline" was feasible. Therefore, they consulted with the masses and listened to their opinions. Experienced farmers believed that the seeds should be soaked in batches, not all soaked on one night. The cadres of the Gao Long Agricultural Cooperative reported this opinion to the District Committee, and the District Committee, after consideration, agreed that they should proceed according to the plan of soaking seeds in batches. After receiving the task of increasing peanut planting, the cadres of the Gao Long Agricultural Cooperative made their best efforts and planted 600 mu more. There was really no land to plant the remaining 100 mu. If they had to "complete the task 100%," they would have to change the paddy fields to plant peanuts, but this would not truly increase production. They truthfully reported the situation to the higher authorities, and as a result, the higher authorities reduced the task of these 100 mu of peanuts.

　　The cadres of the Na Danxiang in the same county took another approach. They said, "There is no mistake in doing according to the instructions of the higher authorities." Someone suggested that if all the seeds were soaked together, they would not be able to transplant them all, and the rice would sprout. The reply was: "The District Committee is responsible for the sprouted rice. If you don't soak them, you are breaking the law!" It was clear that there was no land to increase peanut planting, but the township branch insisted on assigning the task of increasing several hundred mu of peanuts, because the District Committee had said that early-maturing crops could be plowed away and paddy fields could be changed to plant peanuts, and the task must be completed. Liang Tian, a member of the cooperative's management committee and accountant, disagreed with changing the paddy fields to plant peanuts, so the branch held a meeting of Party and Youth League members to criticize "Liang Tian's thinking," and his accounting position was also removed. In this way, the entire township soaked 36,000 jin of grain seeds in one night; the entire township plowed 30 mu of early-maturing crops and changed 148 mu of paddy fields that had already been transplanted, and finally completed the task of increasing peanut planting.

　　Here we see two completely different attitudes towards "deadlines":

　　One is to proceed from the actual situation and conduct independent thinking; the other is not to use one's brain, regardless of the actual situation, "do according to the instructions of the higher authorities, and there is no mistake."

　　One is to consult with the masses when encountering difficulties and contradictions in work, and to reflect the opinions of the masses to the leading organs, so that the leaders can better integrate with the masses; the other is to put big labels on people who have different opinions, and even threaten them with "breaking the law" and "dismissal."

　　One is to think of being responsible for the final result of production and for the masses while thinking of being responsible for the higher authorities; the other is that the tasks of the higher authorities must be completed, and as for future problems, "the District Committee is responsible."

　　Two attitudes, two approaches, which one is right? The facts have already made a conclusion: The early rice yield of the Gao Long Agricultural Cooperative in Fu Chengxiang increased by 25%, and 96% of the cooperative members increased their income in the summer harvest distribution, and the peanut yield is also estimated to increase by more than 30%. As for Na Danxiang, five of the six cooperatives in the entire township reduced production, and one maintained production. The early rice yield in the entire township is estimated to decrease by 30%, and the peanut yield will also decrease by more than 30%.

### 在“限令”前面

    在“限令”前面
    钟怀
    今年春天，广东阳春县委为了提早完成播种工作，不止一次地向下面发命令，有些命令简直是限时限刻：“务必在春分把所有的谷种浸齐”，“限今晚（春分）浸齐谷种，否则以失职论处。”为了完成增种花生的计划，清明过后，阳春县委同样接二连三地发出指示：“无论如何要百分之百地完成任务”，“开荒也得完成任务”。显然，阳春县委这些“限令”带着很大的主观性和强制性，违背了“因地制宜，具体指导”的领导原则，极有可能助长下边的强迫命令作风。
    这里且不去研究阳春县委领导作风中的缺点和错误。让我们来看看下面的干部怎样执行这些“限令”，这对我们理解应该如何正确地对待上级的指示是大有好处的。
    附城乡高?合作社的干部在接到“限今晚浸齐谷种”的指示以后，考虑到过去有过限期浸种结果出了谷仔的教训，怀疑这个“限令”是否行得通。于是，他们同群众商量，倾听群众的意见。有经验的农民都认为应当分批浸种，而不能在一个晚上浸齐种。高?合作社的干部便把这个意见向区委汇报，区委经过考虑，同意他们按照分批浸种的计划去做。在接到增种花生的任务以后，高?合作社的干部尽了最大的努力，多种了六百亩，剩下一百亩实在无地可种，如果一定要“百分之百地完成任务”，那就只好用水田来改种，可是这样做并不能真正增产。他们就实事求是将情况报告上级，结果上级削减了这一百亩花生的任务。
    这个县的那旦乡的干部却采取了另外一种做法。他们说：“照着上级的指示做去就没有错”。有人提出一齐浸种将来插不完要出谷仔，回答是：“出谷仔由区委会负责，你不浸就是犯法！”分明已经没有地可以增种花生，乡支部却硬把增种数百亩花生的任务摊派下去，因为区委说过，早熟作物可以犁掉，水田可以改种花生，任务非完成不可。一个合作社的社务委员兼会计梁添不同意将水田改种花生，于是支部召开党、团员会议批判“梁添思想”，他的会计职务也被撤掉。就这样，全乡在一夜之间浸了三万六千斤谷种；全乡一共犁了三十亩早熟作物，把一百四十八亩已经下了秧的水田改种，总算完成了增种花生的任务。
    在这里我们看到了对待“限令”的两种截然不同的态度：
    一种是从实际情况出发，进行独立的思考；另一种是不动脑筋，不顾实际，“照着上级指示的做去就没有错”。
    一种是在工作中遇到了困难和矛盾，就找群众商量，并将群众的意见反映给领导机关，使领导同群众更好地结合起来；另一种是遇到群众有不同的意见就扣大帽子，甚至以“犯法”、“撤职”相威胁。
    一种是在想到对上级负责的时候，同时想到要对生产的最后结果负责，要对群众负责；另一种是，上级的任务非完成不可，至于将来出了问题，“由区委会负责”。
    两种态度，两种做法，究竟哪一种对呢？事实已经做出了结论：附城乡的高?合作社早造稻谷增产25％，夏收分配中96％的社员增加了收入，花生估计也可以增产30％以上。至于那旦乡，全乡六个合作社就有五个减产，一个保产，全乡早造稻谷估计减产30％，花生也要减产30％以上。
