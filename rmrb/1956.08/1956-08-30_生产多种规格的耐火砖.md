    Producing Various Specifications of Fire Bricks
    Fire bricks are important building materials for constructing blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, boilers, and chimneys. These buildings are sometimes round and sometimes square, so the need for fire bricks is also diverse. However, the specifications of fire bricks currently produced in our country are not many. Take our construction site as an example: building a small boiler requires only 12,000 fire bricks, but in terms of specifications, it requires several types, including square, round, polygonal, and trapezoidal. However, we can only buy one size of fire brick. To meet the needs of the project, we have to mobilize workers to process them temporarily by chopping and then polishing. This not only affects the progress of the project but also causes losses. For a small project like ours, it took fifty workers to process and modify only over a thousand fire bricks. Some bricks, due to inconvenient processing and uneven chopping, also affect the quality of the project. If there were various specifications of fire bricks, these phenomena could be avoided. It is suggested that refractory material factories produce fire bricks of various specifications.

    生产多种规格的耐火砖
    耐火砖是建筑高炉、平炉、锅炉和烟囱等工程中重要的建筑材料之一，这些建筑物有的是圆的，有的是方的，因此它对耐火砖的需要也是各种各样的。可是目前我国生产的耐火砖规格不多。拿我们这个工地来说，建筑一个小型锅炉，所需要的全部耐火砖只有一万二千块，在规格上却需要方的、圆的、多角的、梯形的好几种。但是，我们只能买到一种尺寸的耐火砖。为了适应工程上的需要，只得动员工人临时加工砍，砍了以后还要磨光，结果不仅影响工程进度，也造成了损失。像我们这个不大的工程，用了五十个人工加工，才改制了一千多块耐火砖，有些砖由于加工不方便，砍的不整齐，还影响工程质量。如果有多种规格的耐火砖，这些现象都是可以避免的。建议耐火材料厂烧制各种规格的耐火砖。
