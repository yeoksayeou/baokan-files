Xinhua News Agency, London, August 17th: At the international conference on the Suez Canal issue held on the morning of August 16th in London, the participating countries discussed procedural matters.

    Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke during the discussion, offering opinions on the composition of the conference, the convening of the conference, and the conference's working procedures.

    Following Shepilov's speech, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau spoke in defense of the Western position, stating that the invitation to participating countries was "based on a fair basis."

    Lloyd suggested that the London Conference should follow the procedural principles of the United Nations and resolve any contentious issues through voting. Pineau also advocated making decisions at the conference by majority vote.

    Indian representative Menon opposed the British and French proposals. He pointed out that this conference was different from a United Nations conference because there were no universal principles, especially since Egypt did not participate in the conference. Menon said that if the conference made decisions by majority vote, it might "hinder obtaining objective solutions." Menon's speech was supported by representatives from the Soviet Union, Indonesia, Ceylon, and other countries.

    Menon also suggested that the conference not prescribe a specific agenda, as the participating countries knew the goals and objectives of the conference. This opinion was supported by Dulles.

    The conference finally decided to postpone the discussion on the voting issue until it was actually necessary to vote and decided not to prescribe an agenda for the conference.

    The exchange of views on procedural matters lasted for an hour and a half, and there were no sharp disputes during the discussion. The next meeting will begin to discuss substantive issues.

    在伦敦会议16日上午会议上
    梅农反对用多数表决的程序
    据新华社伦敦17日电　在八月十六日上午举行的关于苏彝士运河问题的国际会议上，参加会议的国家讨论了程序问题。
    苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在讨论中发言，对会议的组成、会议的召开和会议的工作程序提出了意见。
    在谢皮洛夫发言以后，英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺发言为西方的立场辩护，他们说对参加会议国家的邀请是“在公正的基础上发生的。”
    劳埃德建议伦敦会议遵照联合国的程序原则行事，凡有争论的问题通过表决来解决。比诺也主张以多数票作出会议的决定。
    印度代表梅农反对英法的建议。他指出，这个会议并不同于联合国会议，因为它并不存在普遍的原则，特别是因为埃及没有参加会议。梅农说，如果会议以多数表决作出决定的话，就可能“阻碍得到客观的解决办法”。梅农的发言得到了苏联、印度尼西亚、锡兰等国代表的支持。
    梅农还建议会议不要规定明确的议程，因为与会国家都知道这次会议的目标和目的。这个意见得到杜勒斯的支持。
    会议最后决定关于表决的问题留待以后碰到要实际进行表决的时候再来讨论，并且决定会议不规定议程。
    关于程序事项的交换意见进行了一个半小时，讨论中没有发生尖锐的争执。下次会议将开始讨论实质问题。
