    Military music workers are welcoming the first National Music Week with joy and excitement. Participating in the performances are the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department, the Military Band of the General Staff Department, the Zhan You (Comrades) Cultural Troupe, the Naval Cultural Troupe, and the Air Force Cultural Troupe, forming two concerts respectively.

    In the first concert, the joint choir composed of cultural troupes from various military branches sang songs praising the construction of the motherland and magnificent and proud military songs. These songs are: "In Happy Days," "I Am Busy Training for the Motherland," "Ready to Fly to the Battlefield at Any Time," "Ships are Sailing," and "We Must Plant the Victory Flag on Taiwan." These songs reflect the faces of various military branches and express the revolutionary soldiers' love for the great motherland and their sacred responsibility and honor to defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Soldiers also love light, lively, and humorous songs. In programs like "Really Hilarious," "I Want to Be a Good Sharpshooter," "It's Not That the Anti-Aircraft Gun Doesn't Obey," "Attacking the Sky and the Land Together," and "Tank Driver and Tractor Driver," people can perceive the simple, optimistic, and lovely image of the people's soldiers.

    Folk song performances are also a colorful part of the concert. If the adapted folk songs such as "Osmanthus Blooms, Happiness Comes," "Little River Flowing," "Sisters, Come On," "Red Army Returns to Wuzhi Mountain," and "Sisters Cutting Flowers" are popular with the masses, then it can be said that these are new gains made by military authors in learning from national and folk music in recent years.

    The trumpet concerto "Red Army Liberates Nanggoucha" (composed by Mei Bin) is a variation based on the Shaanxi folk song "Danan Goucha." It describes the revolutionary people of Nanggoucha raising the red flag and carrying out a tenacious struggle under the rule of the White Army, and finally liberating Nanggoucha together with the heroic Red Army. The author adopted a historical theme and made a programmatic description in the form of military music; this is a bold attempt.

    Here, I would like to introduce several large choruses performed by the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department: "The Immortal Hero Huang Jiguang" (lyrics by Dong Xiaowu, music by Shi Lemeng). The author vividly depicts the image of this immortal combat hero through tense and dramatic techniques, showing a moving picture of the Battle of Shangganling. This is a work with a strong national style and rich national tones. It is a relatively prominent choral work in recent years that expresses the character of new heroic figures.

    The melody of "Spread the Hero's Name in All Directions" (lyrics by Xu Huaizhong, music by Luo Zongxian and Lu Zulong) is the "Plateau Mountain Song," which has long been loved by many soloists. The melody is beautiful and moving, and the adapted a cappella chorus makes the original work more colorful and vivid. Through the contrast between the lead singer and accompaniment, and the layered development, the author subtly expresses the people's admiration and deep affection for the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army. The chorus technique is simple and appropriate.

    "The Long March Chorus" (lyrics by Chen Qitong, music by Shi Lemeng) is a newly completed large-scale work, divided into seven sections: "Heading for the Journey," "Conquering Snow Mountains to the Plateau," "Wishing the Red Army Safe Journey," "Crossing the Grasslands," "Lazikou," "Deep Admiration," and "Glory" (only the first, second, third, and seventh sections are sung this time). The author made an epic description and eulogy of the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army's predecessor - the Red Army. In the two military concerts, there are also various forms of instrumental music, solo, duet, and historical songs from various war periods.

    部队音乐工作者向音乐周的献礼
    晓河
    部队音乐工作者怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，来迎接第一届全国音乐周。参加演出的，有总政治部文工团歌舞团和总参谋部军乐团、战友文工团、海军文工团、空军文工团，分别组成的两个音乐会。
    在第一个音乐会上，由各军种文工团组成的联合歌队，演唱了为祖国建设而欢呼的颂歌和雄壮自豪的军歌。这些歌曲是：“在幸福的日子里”“我为祖国练兵忙”“随时准备飞向战场”“舰艇在行进”“一定要把胜利的旗帜插到台湾”。这些歌曲，反映了各个军种的面貌，表达了革命军人对于伟大祖国的热爱，和保卫祖国社会主义建设的神圣的责任感和荣誉感。
    战士们也喜爱轻松、活泼和富有风趣的歌曲，在“真正乐死人”“我要当个好射手”“不是机关炮不听话”“天空陆地一齐打”“坦克手和拖拉机手”等节目中，人们可以觉察到人民战士纯朴，乐观可爱的形象。
    民歌演唱也是音乐会中富有色彩的部分。如果说“桂花开幸福来”“小河淌水”“姐妹们来呀”“红军回到五指山”“姊妹剪花”等民歌改编的作品，受到了群众欢迎；那么可以说这是近年来部队作者在向民族、民间音乐学习的新收获。
    小号协奏曲“红军解放南沟岔”（梅滨作曲）是根据陕北民歌“打南沟岔”写成的变奏曲。它描写了革命的南沟岔人民举起红旗，在白匪军统治下，进行着顽强的斗争，终于和英勇的红军一起，解放了南沟岔。作者采用了历史的题材，以军乐的形式作了标题性的描写；这是一种大胆的尝试。
    这里，我介绍一下由总政治部歌舞团演出的几部大合唱：“不朽的英雄黄继光”（董小吾词，时乐蒙曲）的作者通过紧张的戏剧性的手法，集中地、真实地描绘了这个不朽的战斗英雄的形象，展示了上甘岭战役中一幅动人的画面。这是一部具有浓厚的民族风格，和丰富的民族音调的作品。是近年来表现新的英雄人物性格较突出的合唱创作。
    “把英雄的名字传向四面八方”（徐怀中词，罗宗贤，陆祖龙曲）的曲调，是早已为许多独唱家所喜爱的“高原山歌”。旋律优美动人，改编后的无伴奏合唱，使原作在色彩上更加丰富鲜明。作者通过领唱、伴唱的对比，和有层次的发展，细致地表现了人民对于解放军的英雄行为的崇敬和深厚的感情。合唱的手法是简洁的，恰当的。
    “长征大合唱”（陈其通词，时乐蒙曲）是一部新近完成的较大型的作品，分为：“走向征途”“战胜雪山到高原”“祝红军一路安康”“越过草地”“腊子口”“深心的崇敬”“光荣”等七段（此次只唱第一、第二、第三、第七四段）。作者对于人民解放军的前身——红军的可歌可泣的英雄业迹，作了史诗般的描述和歌颂。在两个部队的音乐会中，还有各种形式的器乐曲和独唱、对唱，以及各个战争时期的历史歌曲。
