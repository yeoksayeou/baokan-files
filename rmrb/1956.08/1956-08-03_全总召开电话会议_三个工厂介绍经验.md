Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

The experiences gained by three factories—Shanghai Boiler Factory, Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill, and Shenyang 53 Factory—in carrying out the advanced producer movement were shared with trade union organizations across the country through a telephone conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions one morning. Cadres from trade union organizations in fifty-six provinces, cities, and mining areas across the country participated in the meeting.

Wang Weiguang, director of the Shanghai Boiler Factory, vividly described how their factory transformed from a backward one to an advanced one. He said: Before the first half of 1955, the Shanghai Boiler Factory frequently failed to fulfill the state plan, and the quality of its products was also poor. In the second half of last year, the enterprise leaders gradually clarified the viewpoint of relying on the masses, changed their style of work, improved enterprise management, strengthened the collective leadership of the Party committee, and paid attention to the lives of the masses. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the masses was greatly stimulated. Since the third quarter of last year, they have been completing the state plan every month. In early July of this year, the entire factory comprehensively reached the 1957 production level eighteen months ahead of schedule. Zhao Xizhu, vice chairman of the 53 Factory's trade union, introduced their factory's experience in strengthening the organizational work of advanced workers leading the backward in various forms during the advanced producer movement. Zhang Yunyi, secretary of the Yuhua Cotton Mill's Party committee, introduced their factory's experience in continuously increasing the number of workers reaching advanced levels, as well as their experience in learning, summarizing, and promoting advanced experiences.

    全总召开电话会议
    三个工厂介绍经验
    据新华社讯　上海锅炉厂、武汉裕华纱厂、沈阳五三工厂等三个工厂开展先进生产者运动所取得的经验，在一日上午通过中华全国总工会召开的电话会议向全国各地工会组织作了介绍。参加会议的有全国五十六省、市单位和矿区的工会组织的干部。
    上海锅炉厂厂长王伟光生动地介绍了他们工厂是怎样由落后变成先进的。他说：上海锅炉厂在1955年上半年以前，经常完不成国家计划，产品质量也低劣。去年下半年，企业领导者逐步明确了依靠群众的观点，转变了作风，改进了企业管理工作，加强了党委的集体领导，注意关心群众生活，因此大大激发了群众的生产积极性。从去年第三季度以来就开始月月完成国家计划，今年七月初，全厂提前十八个月全面达到了1957年的生产水平。五三工厂工会副主席赵希珠介绍了他们工厂在开展先进生产者运动中利用各种形式加强先进带动落后的组织工作等方面的经验。裕华纱厂党委书记张允一介绍了他们工厂如何使达到先进水平的职工人数不断增加的经验以及学习、总结和推广先进经验方面的经验。
