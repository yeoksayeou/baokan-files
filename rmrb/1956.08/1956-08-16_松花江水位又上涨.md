Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th -- At 9:00 PM tonight, the water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area reached 120.04 meters, rising another four centimeters in ten hours. According to hydrological experts sent to Harbin by the Ministry of Water Resources, this second flood peak, formed by the confluence of the Lalin River flood peak and the high water levels of the Nen River and the Second Songhua River, will pass through Harbin on the 16th, at which time the water level here will rise further.

The flood control personnel on the 26-kilometer-long embankment in Harbin City have been urgently mobilized. Two rows of wave-breaking wooden rafts have been placed at the sharp bends and protrusions of each major dike. The six critical projects in the city have been rushed to completion. The flood control headquarters of each district has newly established underwater embankment inspection teams, and more than one hundred heroic divers have eliminated many hidden dangers on the dikes. After reinforcement and widening by more than 100,000 flood control troops, the dikes along the river are generally one to three meters wider than they were two years ago, and the rescue teams on each major dike are standing by, determined to overcome the great flood.

    松花江水位又上涨
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　今天晚上九时，哈尔滨地区松花江水位已达120.04公尺，在十个小时之内又上涨了四公分。据水利部派来哈尔滨的水文专家分析，这个由拉林河洪峰和嫩江、第二松花江高水位洪流汇合而成的第二次洪峰，将在十六日过哈尔滨，那时，这里的水位还要上涨。
    在哈尔滨市二十六公里长的堤坝上的防汛人员已经紧急动员起来。各大堤上的急弯、突出点都已经安置了两道防浪木排。全市六处险要工程已经抢修完毕。各分区防汛指挥部新建立了潜水查堤队，一百多个英勇的潜水员已经消除了许多堤坝上的隐患。沿江大堤经过十多万防汛大军的加固和加宽，一般已比两年前加宽一公尺到三公尺，各大堤上抢险队员正严阵以待，决心战胜大洪水的来袭。
