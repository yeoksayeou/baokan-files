Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th. The rural market in Sichuan Province is approaching its peak season. The state-owned department store's third-quarter supply plan for the entire province, in terms of value, is more than 60% higher than the same period last year; many commodities that have been bestsellers in rural peak seasons in the past, such as towels, socks, and rubber shoes, have increased by nearly double compared to the same period last year.

The state-owned department store is continuing to process and order goods from factories, while also improving its wholesale business to ensure market supply after the increase in rural purchasing power. State-owned department store wholesale stations in Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places have dispatched two batches of purchasing personnel to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places to purchase small commodities that are in great demand in the market. Within the province, state-owned department store wholesale stations at all levels have signed contracts with local industries, handicrafts, and specialized companies for the processing and supply of goods worth more than 80 million yuan. State-owned department stores in Luzhou, Suining, Nanchong, and other areas, in conjunction with the autumn supply of goods, have adjusted the variety of commodities in their respective areas to ensure that the supplied goods meet the requirements of local consumers.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th. The commercial departments of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are transferring a large quantity of daily necessities, food, and fruits to the Karamay oilfield to supply workers of all ethnic groups.

Now, there is already a chill in the morning and evening in the Karamay oilfield. In the retail departments of the trading company, a large number of autumn goods such as绒,毛衣裤,夹制服,带胶雨衣(velvet, wool sweaters and trousers, interlining uniforms, and rubber raincoats) have been put on the market. In the past month, the variety of goods in the trading company's retail departments located in the oilfield has increased from more than 200 to more than 1,000. Since the beginning of summer, a total of more than 110 tons of various fruits such as apples, watermelons, cantaloupes, and grapes transported from Yining, Manas, and Changji have been brought, and large quantities of fruits are still being continuously transported in.

According to the local climate conditions in Karamay, the commercial departments of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have also made early preparations and transportation of winter supplies. Cotton clothes, cotton gloves, cotton overcoats, felt boots, and other items needed for workers in winter have already been processed and ordered. 20,000 sets of cotton clothes have been almost completed and will soon be transported to the mining area. Rice and flour needed for the winter are now being transported from Yining, Tacheng, and Shawan to the mining area.

In order to enable workers of all ethnic groups to eat fresh vegetables and beef and mutton in winter, the commercial department has ordered 5 million catties of winter vegetables such as cabbage and green onions from the Manas Reclamation Area farm of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is nearby, and has selected the winter pasture at the foot of Genghis Khan Mountain, more than ten kilometers away from the mining area, as a place to store live livestock, so as to store a large number of live livestock for the consumption of workers of all ethnic groups in the mining area during the ice-sealed season.

    新疆商业部门把大批日用物资运油区
    新华社成都11日电　四川省农村市场已临旺季。省国营百货公司第三季度对全省的百货供应计划，以金额计，比去年同期增加60％以上；许多历年在农村旺季最畅销的商品如毛巾、袜子、胶鞋等，比去年同期增加近一倍。
    国营百货公司正在继续向工厂加工、订货，同时改进批发业务，以做好农村购买力提高以后的市场供应工作。成都、重庆等地的国营百货批发站，已经派出两批采购人员到上海、广州、天津等地去采购市场需要量很大的小百货。在省内，各级国营百货批发站已经同当地地方工业、手工业和专业公司签订了总值八千多万元的百货加工供应合同。泸州、遂宁、南充等专区的国营百货公司，结合秋季物资供应，对全区商品花色品种作了调剂，使供应的商品能符合当地消费者的要求。
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆维吾尔自治区商业部门正调运大批日用品、食品和水果，源源运到克拉玛依油区，供应各族职工。
    现在，克拉玛依油区早晨和晚上已经有凉意，在贸易公司门市部里，大批绒、毛衣裤、夹制服、带胶雨衣等秋季商品已经上市。设在油区的贸易公司门市部，近一月来货物品种已经从二百多种增加到一千多种。入夏以来从伊宁、玛纳斯、昌吉一带运来的苹果、西瓜、哈密瓜、葡萄等各种水果，共有一百一十多吨，大量的瓜果还在不断的运进中。
    新疆维吾尔自治区商业部门根据克拉玛依当地的气候情况，还及早地进行了冬季物资的准备和运输工作。冬季职工工作所需的棉衣、皮棉手套、皮棉大衣、毡筒等，早已在加工订制，两万套棉衣已快制成，不久就可运到矿区。现在正从伊宁、塔城、沙湾一带往矿区运输冬季所需的大米、面粉。
    为了使各族职工能在冬季吃到新鲜的蔬菜和牛、羊肉，商业部门已向附近的中国人民解放军玛纳斯垦区农场订购了白菜、大葱等冬季蔬菜五百万斤，并且选择了距矿区十多公里的成吉斯汗山脚下的冬季牧场，作为储存活畜的地方，储备大量活畜，以便在冰封的季节里供矿区各族职工食用。（附图片）
