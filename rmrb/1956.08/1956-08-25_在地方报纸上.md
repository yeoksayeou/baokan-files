On Local Newspapers

    Listen to the Opinions of Pig Farmers
    The Fujian Daily published an editorial on August 8th entitled "Listen to the Opinions of Pig Farmers." The editorial quoted a letter from Yang Fumei, director of the Huochetou Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Shaxian County. Yang Fumei's letter reflected three problems: First, the purchasing departments buy at low prices and sell at high prices, so farmers do not benefit. Their cooperative loses 4.43 yuan for every pig they sell. Second, pig farmers cannot afford to eat pork or oil. Third, after fulfilling the assigned purchase quotas, farmers cannot dispose of the extra pigs themselves. Yang Fumei said that if these problems are not resolved, they will not be willing to raise pigs anymore. The Fujian Daily pointed out that the situation reflected by Yang Fumei is not an isolated case in the province. The number of live pigs in the province this year is about 20% lower than last year. Of course, there may be other reasons, but the problems reflected by Yang Fumei are indeed an important reason hindering the increase in pig production.
    On the same day, the Fujian Daily also published a news item reporting that Pinghe County had increased pig production by more than 10,000 heads in just over a month by resolving specific problems in raising more pigs. The measures they took were: allowing pig farmers to keep five jin of pork for every vegetable pig sold to the state; not increasing the purchase quotas for pigs raised in addition to the three-fixed self-reported pig raising tasks completed by farmers; the county People's Bank issued a large number of pig loans; the Grain Bureau increased the supply of feed grain; and the food company directly distributed advance purchase payments and advance purchase grain to pig farmers.

    Prepare Wheat Seeds Early
    The Henan Daily published an editorial on August 15th entitled "Prepare Wheat Seeds Properly and Early." The editorial said: Preparing wheat seeds well and on time is the fundamental requirement for this year's autumn planting work and is the primary key to striving for a good wheat harvest next year. To achieve the requirement of planting wheat well on time, the key lies in doing a good job of preparing for wheat planting as early as possible, so that people are ready for the season, rather than the season waiting for people.
    Generally, agricultural cooperatives have reserved more wheat seeds during the summer distribution. However, there are still problems in the work of reserving and storing seeds, and the problems are even greater in areas that suffered disasters in the summer. The Hongli Agricultural Cooperative in Dazhao Township, Xiping County, retained nearly 20,000 jin of wheat seeds. In terms of quantity, it is enough for the entire cooperative to plant wheat, but in terms of quality, there are major problems. In addition to the sprouted and moldy seeds that cannot be used as seeds, only more than 6,000 jin are actually usable.
    The editorial also said: The current problem is that party and government leaders at all levels have not yet paid enough attention to the preparation work for wheat planting and do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation and problems in reserving and storing seeds. In particular, the agricultural and grain departments are generally satisfied with the large number of seeds reserved by agricultural cooperatives and do not see the problems that exist in the work of reserving and storing seeds. If this complacency is not quickly overcome, it will inevitably delay the farming season and affect production. Therefore, whether it is a disaster area or a non-disaster area, it is necessary to immediately organize special inspection teams, divide the region into several different types based on the summer harvest situation, and go to key cooperatives to conduct inspections warehouse by warehouse. Based on typical survey materials, calculate whether the wheat seeds reserved by each agricultural cooperative in the region are sufficient and whether the area of improved varieties can be expanded.
    The editorial concluded: All agricultural production cooperatives should see that the wheat seeds stored this year are not only mixed in variety, lack improved varieties, and of low quality, but also have been turned and dried less and have a higher moisture content, making them extremely susceptible to mildew. Each cooperative should combine the current autumn field management work, assign a certain amount of manpower to inspect the wheat seed storage work, take advantage of the weather to turn and dry and air-select the seeds. And according to the amount of wheat land, start to study and formulate a wheat planting plan, conduct germination tests universally before planting wheat, and select the seeds again to improve the seed germination rate, so as to ensure that the number of reserved wheat seeds is sufficient and the quality is high.

    听听养猪人的意见
    福建日报八月八日发表了题为“听听养猪人的意见”的社论。社论中引用了沙县城关镇火车头农业社主任杨福妹的来信。杨福妹在信中反映了三个问题：一、收购部门低价购入、高价卖出，农民得不到利益，他们社卖一头猪就要亏本四元三角四分。二、养猪的人吃不上肉和油。三、农民完成了派购任务，对多养的猪不能自行处理。杨福妹说，这些问题如得不到解决，他们就不愿再养猪了。福建日报指出，杨福妹反映的情况，在全省来说并不是个别的。全省今年的生猪比去年减少约20％，当然可能还有其他方面的原因，杨福妹反映的问题确是阻碍生猪增产的重要原因之一。
    同日福建日报又发表了一条消息，报道平和县由于解决了增养生猪中的具体问题，一个多月来增养生猪万余头。他们采取的措施是：每头菜猪卖给国家时，允许养猪户留五斤猪肉；农民完成三定自报养猪任务后，增养的生猪不增购；县人民银行发放大批生猪贷款；粮食局增加饲料供应粮；食品公司把生猪预购款和预购粮，直接发给养猪户。
    及早准备麦种
    河南日报八月十五日发表了“及早把麦种准备停当”的社论。社论说：适时地把麦种好，是今年秋种工作的根本要求，是争取来年小麦丰收的首要关键。实现适时种好小麦的要求，关键在于及早做好种麦前的准备工作，使人等季节，莫叫季节等人。
    各个农业社在夏季分配中，一般都留了较多的麦种，然而，在留种储种工作上还是有问题的，在夏季遭灾地区问题就更大一些。西平大赵乡红利农业社自留麦种近两万斤，论数量足够全社种麦之用，论质量则大成问题，除生芽、发霉不能作种子用的以外，实际管用的只剩六千多斤。
    社论还说：当前的问题，就在于各级党政领导尚未重视种麦准备工作，对留种储种工作中的情况和问题，了解不够，认识不足。特别是农业部门和粮食部门，一般都满足于农业社自留种子的数量不少，看不到留种储种工作中存在的问题。这种麻痹自满情绪如不迅速克服，必然贻误农时，影响生产。因此，无论是灾区，或者是非灾区都需要立即组织专门检查组，根据夏季收成情况，把本地区分成若干不同类型，分别到重点社逐仓进行检查，根据典型调查材料，算出本地区各农业社自留的麦种是否够用，良种面积能否扩大。
    社论最后说：各个农业生产合作社要看到今年入仓的麦种，不仅品种混杂，良种不多，质量不高，而且翻晒又少，水分较大，极易霉坏。各社要结合当前的秋田管理工作，指派一定力量，检查一下麦种保管工作，趁天进行翻晒和风选。并根据麦地多少，着手研究制定种麦计划，在种麦前普遍地进行发芽试验，再次进行挑选，提高种子发芽率，以保证所留麦种数量足、质量高。
