    The Face Is Also Revolutionary
    Han Saofu
    There was a self-proclaimed scholar who always wanted to publish "unique" insights to show off his erudition. For example, he had a different opinion on the two lines of poetry by Tao Yuanming that everyone is familiar with: "Picking chrysanthemums beneath the eastern fence, I leisurely gaze at the Southern Mountain." He said that Southern Mountain was not the name of a mountain, but that Southern Mountain meant longevity, "May your life be as long as the Southern Mountain." Because people in the past all said that drinking chrysanthemum tea could prolong life, the poet was inspired when picking chrysanthemums, thinking that he could live forever.
    One day, he was having dinner with a friend, and they talked about a folk song from the Water Margin: "The blazing sun is like a fire, the rice in the fields is half withered; the farmer's heart is like boiling soup, while the sons of princes wave their fans!" He explained: "Why is this poem revolutionary? Look at its first two words, 'Red Sun.' Red symbolizes revolution..." At this moment, one of his children was scooping a spoonful of bright red tomato soup to his mouth, and when he heard his father's words, he rushed to say, "Dad, look! This tomato soup is also revolutionary!" The old professor was stunned, and his face immediately turned red, while another child shouted, "Dad, your face is also revolutionary!"

    脸也是革命的
    韩扫夫
    有一位自封的学者，总想发表“独特”的见解，以显示自己渊博。譬如大家所熟悉的陶渊明两句诗：“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”。他的见解就与众不同。他说南山不是山名，南山即长寿之意，是“寿比南山”。因为从前的人都说喝了菊花茶可以延年益寿，因此诗人在采菊的时候，想到自己可以长生不老而诗兴大发了。
    有一天，他陪朋友一起吃饭，席间谈起水浒传中的一首民谣“赤日炎炎似火烧，野田禾稻半枯焦；农夫心内如汤煮，王孙公子把扇摇！”他解释说：“为什么这首诗富有革命性呢？你看它头两字就是‘赤日’，赤者红也，红色就是象征革命的……”这时他的一个孩子正舀了一匙鲜红的番茄汤送到咀边，听见爸爸的话忙抢着说：“爸爸，你看！这番茄汤也是革命的”老教授一愣，脸孔立刻红起来了，而另一个孩子却又叫起来：“爸爸，你的脸也是革命的了！”
