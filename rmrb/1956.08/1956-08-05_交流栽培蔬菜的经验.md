(Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou) Agricultural cadres from the suburbs of Shanghai held a discussion with cadres and farmers from the suburbs of Guangzhou on July 31st to exchange experiences in vegetable cultivation. Relevant staff from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and the South China Agricultural Science Research Institute also participated in this symposium.

　　At the meeting, cadres from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture said excitedly: The problem of how to produce a large quantity of vegetables in high-temperature climates to meet the needs of the people has been solved after our visit to the suburbs of Guangzhou. Choosing excellent heat-resistant varieties is very important for cultivating vegetables in high temperatures. The farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou have done a great job in this respect, but the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai have rarely achieved this.

　　The experience of using water-filled depressions (水坑地) by farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou also attracted the attention of the Shanghai cadres. Water-filled depressions not only reduce the temperature of the soil, but also facilitate drainage, water storage, and irrigation.

　　The cadres from the Guangzhou Suburban Office then introduced technical experiences related to variety selection, multiple cropping, and intercropping. They also said that they would compile these experiences and send them to the agricultural cadres in the suburbs of Shanghai for reference.

　　Wei Miaogen, director of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Shanghai, introduced his experience in planting eggplants in the spring and autumn seasons at the meeting, and also discussed the issue of tomato pruning. Cadres from the Guangzhou Suburban Office also introduced several methods for preventing and controlling vegetable diseases and insect pests.

　　At the end of the symposium, the cadres from Shanghai expressed their gratitude and invited the cadres and farmers from Guangzhou to visit the suburbs of Shanghai.

    交流栽培蔬菜的经验
    据新华社广州讯　来自上海市郊区的农业干部七月三十一日和广州市郊区的干部和农民座谈交流了栽培蔬菜的经验。广东省农业厅、华南农业科学研究所的有关工作人员也参加了这个座谈会。
    会上，上海市农业局的干部兴奋地说：怎样在高温的气候下生产大量的蔬菜，以满足人民的需要，这一问题已经在我们参观广州市郊区后获得了解决。选择优良的抗热品种，对于在高温下栽培蔬菜是很重要的。广州市郊区农民做得很好，但上海市郊区农民还很少做到这点。
    广州市郊区农民使用水坑地的经验，也受到上海市干部的注意。水坑地不但能够降低土壤的温度，而且便于排水、蓄水和浇水。
    广州市郊区办事处的干部接着介绍了有关选择品种、复种、间作的技术经验，并且说以后要把这些经验整理出来，寄给上海郊区的农业干部作参考。　　上海市郊区幸福农业社主任卫妙根在会上介绍了春、秋两季种植茄子的经验，并且谈到了番茄整枝的问题。广州市郊区办事处的干部还介绍了防治蔬菜病虫害的几种方法。
    当座谈会结束的时候，上海市的干部表示感谢，并且邀请广州市的干部和农民到上海市郊区去参观访问。
