Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 25th (TASS): Hungarian coal production reached 22.3 million tons last year, more than double the pre-war level. Currently, Hungary's per capita coal production is already one-half higher than that of France. This year, the plan is to produce 23 million tons of coal, and so far, the monthly coal production has exceeded the plan.

The rapid increase in Hungarian coal production is due to the implementation of mechanization measures in coal mining. During the first Five-Year Plan (1950-1954), dozens of "Donbas" and "Miner" brand coal mining combines and many other machines were added to Hungarian mines. This year, in the Tatabánya coalfield, which accounts for approximately one-third of Hungary's total coal production, three thousand highly productive machines, including loaders, conveyors, and other machines, will be added by the end of the year.

    匈牙利煤产量每月都超额完成计划
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利煤产量在去年达到了二千二百三十万吨，比战前增加了一倍以上。目前，按人口平均计算，匈牙利的煤产量已经比法国多二分之一。今年计划生产二千三百万吨煤，到目前为止，每个月生产的煤都是超过计划的。
    匈牙利煤产量的迅速增加，是在采煤工作中采取了机械化的措施。在第一个五年计划（1950—1954年）期间，匈牙利各矿山已增添了数十台“顿巴斯”和“矿工”牌采煤联合机和许多其他机器。今年，仅在开采量约占匈牙利全部煤产量三分之一的达塔班湟亚煤田，就将在年底前增添三千台具有高度生产能力的机器，其中包括装卸机、运输机和其他机器。
