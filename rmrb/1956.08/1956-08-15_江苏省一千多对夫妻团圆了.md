Since the beginning of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee has transferred or is about to transfer 2,336 people to accommodate the marital relationships of staff in various positions. Among them, more than 1,100 people have already reported to various locations, and the remaining transfer orders have been issued or are being actively processed.

This relocation covers provinces across the country, with 52 people being transferred to and from provinces as far away as Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Liaoning. Gong Dongying, an elementary school teacher from Songjiang County, whose husband works in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, wrote a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Personnel Bureau requesting a transfer. The bureau actively contacted the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Personnel Department. Recently, she has been transferred. In order to take care of the officers stationed in Nanjing and the cadres working in Nanjing, the personnel departments of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City have also specially organized forces to conduct investigations. According to the investigation, 230 family members of the troops stationed in Nanjing need to be transferred, and part of them have already been transferred. It is expected that all of them can be resolved by the end of September. The spouses of some cadres in Nanjing City who used to work in rural areas have also been properly placed in the suburban areas and Jiangning County.

In the relocation work, the relevant departments also pay attention to taking care of their original occupations and hobbies as much as possible. For example, Li Bingwan, an obstetrician at the Suqian Maternal and Child Health Station, whose husband works at Puzhen Railway Station, was transferred to work at Puzhen Railway Hospital.

    江苏省一千多对夫妻团圆了
    今年以来，江苏省人民委员会为照顾各个岗位上的工作人员夫妻关系而调动或即将调动的人数达2，336人，其中有一千一百多人已经到各地报到，其余的已下达调令或正在积极处理中。
    这次调动地区分布全国各省，较远的有新疆、甘肃、青海、云南、陕西、辽宁等省内外调动的五十二人。松江县小学教员龚东英的爱人在内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟工作，她写了一封信给江苏省人事局要求调去，该局就积极同内蒙古自治区人事部门联系，最近，她已调去。为照顾驻南京部队和在南京市工作的干部，江苏省和南京市人事部门还特地组织力量，进行了调查。根据调查驻南京部队中有二百三十个家属要调动，现在其中一部分已调来，预计在九月底可全部解决。在南京市一部分干部的爱人过去在农村工作，也妥善安置在市郊区和江宁县工作。
    在调动工作中，有关部门还注意尽量照顾他们原来的职业和爱好。如宿迁妇幼保健站助产士李炳婉的爱人在浦镇车站工作，她就被调到了浦镇铁路医院工作。
