　　　　Air Drop

　　Aviation pilot Zhou Zhenming had just returned to Beijing after completing a mission when he received a new order: to go to an airport in Hebei to participate in an airdrop of disaster relief supplies. He was so excited that he didn't sleep well that night.

　　The next day, he flew his plane over the Hebei Plain and saw an endless expanse of water engulfing all the villages. People standing on the rooftops waved to the sky. He couldn't see the expressions of the disaster victims or hear their voices, but he fully understood their eagerness for rescue. "We can't drop the life-saving food on the wrong target!" he encouraged himself, circling in the air to find the right drop zone, and gently dropped the grain.

　　When he returned after completing his first mission, he was exhausted. According to usual practice, he should have rested well. But when he thought about how many lives could be saved by dropping another bag of grain sooner, he immediately restrained his exhaustion, insisted on staying at the airport, sweating as he inspected and repaired the plane, even eating lunch at the airport.

　　In the afternoon, after carrying out his second airdrop mission, he busied himself studying the route for the next day's airdrop and the markings for the drop points, staying busy until after ten o'clock at night before going to sleep.

　　　　Rescue

　　Yang Luocong, a peasant from Yangjia Village, Zhengding County, in his forties, had been guarding the northern bank of the Hutuo River day and night, not having slept for two nights. This day, he was carrying a sack to reinforce the sub-dike of the Hutuo River when he suddenly heard cries and calls for help from the south bank of the river. He dropped the sack and went to the flood control headquarters to request permission to rescue people on the south bank. After receiving approval, he climbed across the iron bridge over the Hutuo River and arrived at the south bank. At this time, the south bank was a vast expanse of water. It was dark, and he couldn't see the villages. He jumped into the water without hesitation, wading through chest-deep water towards the cries. He carried people from the village to the embankment, one trip after another. His legs were scratched by branches, and blood flowed out. He bandaged the wounds and jumped into the water to rescue people again. This was the third night he had not slept, and fatigue and hunger tormented him. As he carried the tenth person toward the river embankment, he was so exhausted that he almost fainted, but when he thought of the small child he was carrying on his back, he struggled forward. As soon as he reached the shore, he collapsed. When he regained consciousness, the water was even deeper, and he could no longer wade through the water to rescue people. So he led the people he had carried over, broke off branches and made a raft, and set off for the disaster-stricken village again, persisting until he rescued the last person from the village.

　　Like Being at Home

　　In the home of Xu Yihai in Jiujie, Zhuozhou County, a woman was lying quietly on the kang (platform bed), with a child suckling in her arms. This was the wife of Meng Fanzhang, a disaster victim settled here.

　　It was in the afternoon of August 3rd when Meng Fanzhang's wife was giving birth when the North Juma River overflowed and breached its banks. The flood rushed into the village, the water passed his knees, over the bed, and they couldn't stay in the house. He held his newborn child in one hand and pulled his wife with the other, and went up to the roof. The rain was still falling, the water was still rising, and Meng Fanzhang was terrified. The rescue boat arrived, and cadres carried his wife onto the boat. Meng Fanzhang took the child onto the boat and arrived in Zhuozhou County. As soon as he got off the boat, Wang Shulan, a rescue worker in the city, rushed up to take his child, Wan Shulan took his quilt, and hired a tricycle for his wife, settling him into Xu Yihai's home. The Xu family treated them like their own family, giving them fresh vegetables and pickles, and letting them use the stove to cook first. The government sent millet and provided free medical treatment for his wife. Now they were living as if they were in their own home, Meng Fanzhang's wife was recuperating peacefully, and the baby was sleeping soundly.

    洪水到来的时候
    洛牧
            空　投
    航空驾驶员周振明刚执行完任务回到北京，就接到一个新的命令：到河北某地机场参加空投救灾物资。这一夜他激动得没有睡好觉。
    第二天，他驾着飞机来到河北平原的上空，看见一望无际的汪洋大水把所有的村庄都包围起来了。屋顶上站着的人群，向天空挥手致意，他看不见灾民的表情，听不到他们的声音，但是他完全了解这些人期待援救的心情。“不能投错目标损失了救命粮！”他勉励着自己，驾着飞机在空中盘旋，找准了投放目标，轻轻地把粮食投下去了。
    当他完成第一次任务回来，浑身都困乏了。按照平常惯例，是该好好休息一下的。但当他想到早投下一袋粮就能救活多少人命时，立刻就克制着困乏，坚持不离机场，挥汗检查和修理飞机，连午饭也在机场上吃。
    下午，执行了第二次空投任务回来，又忙着研究第二天空投的路线、空投地点的标帜，一直忙到夜里十点多钟才睡了觉。
            抢　救
    正定县杨家庄四十多岁的农民杨洛从，日夜守卫在滹沱河的北堤上，已经两个夜晚没有睡觉了。这天，他正扛着麻袋加修滹沱河的子埝，忽听河南岸传来了哭声和呼喊救命声。他扔下麻袋就到防汛指挥部请求到南岸抢救。得到批准后，他爬过了滹沱河的铁桥，来到了河南岸。这时南岸已是一片汪洋大水。天黑了，看不到村庄，他不顾一切地跳入水中，趟着齐胸深的大水，向着哭声扑去。一趟又一趟地从村中往堤上背人。腿被树枝划破了，鲜血直往外流，他包扎了伤口，又跳到水中去救人。这是第三个夜晚没有睡觉了，疲倦和饥饿折磨着他。当他救出第十个人往河堤上游时，全身疲乏得几乎昏倒，可是一想到自己身上还背着一个小孩子，他又挣扎着前进了。刚到了岸上，他自己就昏倒了。当他清醒过来后，水更深了，不能趟水抢救了。于是他就领着被他背过来的人，折树枝编成筏子，乘着筏子又向灾村出发了，一直坚持到从灾村救出了最后一个人。
    如同在自己家里
    在涿县城里九街徐义海的家里，炕上安静地躺着一个妇女，孩子正在母亲的怀里吮着奶。这是安置在这里的灾民孟繁章的妻子。
    那是8月3日的下午，孟繁章的妻子正生孩子，北拒马河漫溢决口了，洪水闯进了村，水漫过了膝盖，漫过了床铺，屋子里呆不下去了，他一手抱着刚生下来的小孩，一手拉着妻子，上了房顶。雨还在下，水还在涨，孟繁章正在心惊胆战，救生船赶来了，干部把他妻子背到船上，孟繁章抱着孩子上了船，来到了涿县城里。他刚一下船，城里的抢救工作人员王淑兰赶上来接过他的孩子，万淑兰接了他的被子，并给他的妻子雇了一辆三轮车，把他安置到徐义海家里。徐家像对待自己的家人一样，送给他们鲜菜和咸菜，把锅灶让他们先做饭。政府送来小米，又免费给他妻子治病。现在他们如同生活在自己家里一样，孟繁章的妻子在安心地休养，婴儿安静地酣睡着。
