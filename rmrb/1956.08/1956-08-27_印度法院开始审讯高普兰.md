    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 26th: According to the Press Trust of India, the court in Ahmedabad, Bombay Province, India, began the trial of Gopalan, leader of the Indian Communist Party's parliamentary group, on August 23rd. Gopalan was arrested on August 17th on charges of allegedly violating a city ban. The police guarded the court during the opening of the trial.
    The trial on August 23rd was delayed for nearly two hours due to demonstrations by supporters of the movement against the establishment of a bilingual Bombay state.
    The latest issue of "New Age" weekly published an open letter from Gopalan to the Prime Minister, in which he urged Nehru to pay attention to some facts regarding the curfew imposed in Ahmedabad during the recent riots against the formation of a bilingual Bombay state. In his letter, Gopalan pointed out: "Merchants, trading companies, and those places that have become strongholds of the Congress Party paid tribute to the martyrs, including even those merchants who suffered in the city's incidents. They know that the people killed were innocent, including young and peaceful demonstrators holding books in their hands." Finally, he asked the Prime Minister not to remain silent while "witnessing such things." "You are in a high position, and I believe you will come forward to stop these situations."

    印度法院开始审讯高普兰
    新华社新德里26日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度孟买省阿麦达巴的法院已经在8月23日开始对印度共产党议会党团领袖高普兰进行审讯。高普兰是在8月17日以所谓违反市内禁令的罪名被捕的。开审时，警察把法庭警戒了起来。
    由于反对建立孟买双语言邦的运动的支持者举行示威，8月23日的审讯延迟了将近两小时。
    最近一期“新世纪”周刊发表了高普兰给总理的公开信，他在信中促请尼赫鲁注意有关最近反对成立孟买双语言邦的骚乱期间阿麦达巴实行宵禁的一些事实。高普兰在他的信中指出：“商人、贸易公司和成为国大党据点的那些地方都对殉难者致敬，其中甚至也有在市内事变中遭了殃的那些商人。他们知道，被杀的人是无辜的人，其中有手里拿着书本的年青的和平示威者。”最后，他要求总理不要“目击这种事情”而保持沉默。“你身居高位，我相信你会挺身而出，使这些情形得到制止。”
