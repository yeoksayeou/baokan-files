In the Days of Fighting the Flood
Collective Writing by Xinhua News Agency Reporters in Harbin

In early August, Harbin, the largest city in the Songhua River basin, faced the threat of the largest flood in its history. People still remember the flood of 1932, which brought great pain and disaster to the people of Harbin. How did the people of Harbin get through this flood, which was close to the 1932 water level? This is a concern for everyone. The following are some snapshots of various aspects of Harbin during the days of fighting the flood.

In the Flood Control Headquarters

From the first day of August, the water level of the Songhua River rose sharply, quickly breaking the highest water level since liberation. During these days, the flood control personnel directed the people of the city day and night to carry out a tenacious struggle against the flood. More than thirty telephones in the city headquarters rang constantly, reporting the progress of the struggle on various fronts and issuing the commanders' orders. When a levee showed signs of seepage and subsidence, the headquarters immediately dispatched dozens of trucks loaded with personnel and equipment to support the emergency rescue.

At midnight on the 6th and the morning of the 7th, more than one million residents of the city were soundly asleep when suddenly wind and rain struck, and the flood peak of the Songhua River arrived simultaneously, with the water level rising to 119.64 meters. At 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, the water level rose to 119.72 meters, exceeding the water mark left by the 1932 flood on the piers of the Songhua River Bridge. In 1932, at this moment, the Daoli and Daowai districts of Harbin were already submerged in the flood. But now, although the waves are fiercely impacting the levees everywhere, the urban area is safe and sound under the protection of tens of thousands of flood control troops. Lu Qi'en, the general commander of flood control for the city and the mayor, and the responsible cadres of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led engineering personnel to the critical dikes in separate groups, braving the storm and rain to direct the emergency rescue. During these days, the State Council and the Central Flood Control Headquarters continuously allocated large quantities of flood control materials to Harbin from other places, and frequently made long-distance calls to the provincial and municipal flood control leading organs to inquire about the water situation and give instructions. During these days, the flood control headquarters concentratedly embodied the firm will of the people of the city to overcome the flood and the state's infinite concern for the lives of the people.

On the Dangerous Levees

As the flood continued to rise and seriously threatened Harbin, thousands of people were working day and night on the dozens of kilometers of river dikes, busily reinforcing and raising the levees and preparing for emergency rescue. In the Jiangnan Taiping District, there is a levee more than 4,000 meters long, behind which are more than a dozen factories, the Sankeshu Railway Station, and a large number of residents. It is one of the most dangerous sections of the city. Although nearly 10,000 people had been working day and night in shifts here to reinforce and raise the dikes for five days before the flood struck, the entire levee was generally raised and thickened by more than one meter, and in very dangerous places, it was raised by three or four meters. Hong Zhong, the head of Taiping District, is the general commander of the emergency rescue for this levee. Although he had not slept for three days and three nights, he still insisted on directing the emergency rescue on the levee. When the rescue workers from various factories discovered the danger, they immediately placed soil bags under the base of the levee that was about to collapse. The female workers of the cannery also participated in the emergency rescue struggle. They and the male workers ran together to transport the soil bags to the levee. More than 100 members of the Qianjin Vegetable Production Cooperative have been guarding the levee in shifts for four days and nights. Shi Keyi, the director of the cooperative and a Communist Party member, who had not slept for three days, took the lead in going into the water to drive wooden stakes, leading the cooperative members to block a dangerous section of the levee that was almost breached.

On the dangerous levees everywhere, people fought the flood with this kind of selfless spirit.

Ensuring Both Flood Control and Production

"Ensuring both flood control and production!" This is the fighting slogan put forward by the people of Harbin in the struggle against the flood. On the 7th, the reporter visited the state-owned Harbin Woolen Mill, which is close to the Songhua River, and saw that the river water was already rolling with waves inside the levee a dozen meters away from the factory. Trucks transporting flood control materials were constantly running on the levee, and people were busily piling up bags of sand to reinforce the levee, but the tall chimneys of the factory were still emitting thick smoke as usual, and the sound of machines turning could be heard from the factory buildings. Pan Xihui, the deputy director of the factory, is an old worker of the factory. He told the reporter that the flood that poured out of the Songhua River in 1932 had submerged the factory. When the flood struck, the workers did not have time to escape and had to squeeze onto the second floor, and production was suspended for three months.

This time, although the water level on the river surface has exceeded that of 1932, we are still producing. In various workshops, the workers are working hard to complete the August production plan, striving to produce twice as many plaid blankets this month as in July. During the days of fighting the flood, the vast majority of factories in Harbin, like the Woolen Mill, had their chimneys smoking as usual and their machines turning non-stop.

Shops Operating as Usual

During the days of the flood peak, business in the city was as usual. Jingyu Street, where commerce is concentrated, was as crowded as ever, with customers carefully selecting clothing, shoes, furniture, food, and toys in the shops. Mobile vendors selling fruit and popsicles on the street were shouting loudly.

The reporter visited the largest joint state-private department store in Harbin, Tongji Department Store. The manager of the store, Liu Shiqiu, had experienced the flood of 1932. He said that at that time, this prosperous street was a vast expanse of water, and people had to take a boat from the second-floor window to go out. At that time, the main urban areas were submerged, and the shops were closed for one or two months, and prices soared, bringing a huge disaster to the people. Later, he proudly talked about the situation of fighting the flood this time, saying that the threat of the flood had not affected business and people's lives. The business situation of the shopping mall has been completely normal for the past few days. In the first few days of August, the daily sales amount was around 13,000 yuan, which was an increase of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the daily turnover in July. This is because this period is when employees receive increased wages and come to the store to buy goods. The reporter observed various goods on the shelves in the business hall, and the prices of all commodities were the same as before and had not been changed.

Residents Under the River Dike

The Shinchang (New Market), Qiantang Street, and Dongshichang (East Market) areas of Daowai, which were the first to be flooded in 1932, are as bustling as ever these days. In the flower beds in the heart of the street, various brightly colored flowers are in full bloom. The Shinchang and Qiantang Street areas, known as the "Tianqiao" (Overpass) of Harbin, are still bustling with tourists. The posters in front of the Heilongjiang Provincial Folk Art Theater here announce the programs to be staged day and night. In the Tongli area of Shinchang Street, several teahouses are crowded with people listening to storytelling and comic dialogues. Several residents who have experienced the flood disaster of 1932 recounted to reporters the situation when the dike breached at that time. That year was also in early August. One day, before dawn, when they were still in their dreams, the river dike breached, and the surging flood quickly submerged several streets along the river. Zhang, an elderly woman living near the river, had her slab house filled with water, and her family of four had to climb to the roof and live there for more than a month. Gu Yun, a 68-year-old woman who now lives in Building 33 of Dongshichang, said that she had to get on a boat from the second floor and row a sampan to go out to buy food and fetch water. These residents who have personally suffered from flood disasters now live quietly in their own homes. The elderly woman surnamed Zhang also specially led the reporter to see the river dike, overlooking her house from the dike. The dike is higher than the house she lives in, and the doors and windows of the house are completely covered by the dike. The river dike forms a barrier for these residents.

    在同洪水做斗争的日子里
    新华社驻哈尔滨记者集体采写
    八月上旬，松花江流域最大的城市哈尔滨，面临着历史上最大洪水的威胁。人们还记得1932年的一次洪水，曾给哈尔滨市人民带来的巨大痛苦和灾难，那么在这一次接近1932年水位的洪水侵袭期间，哈尔滨市人民是怎样渡过去的呢？这是大家所关心的。下边就是在和洪水做斗争的日子里，哈尔滨各方面的一些片断情景。
    在防汛指挥部里
    从进入八月的头一天起，松花江的水位就时时猛涨，很快便突破了解放以来最高的水位。在这些日子里，防汛人员日夜不停地指挥全市人民，同洪水展开顽强的斗争。市指挥部里的三十多台电话机不时响着铃，报告着各个战线上的斗争情况，下达着指挥员的命令。有一处堤坝出现了浸透、沉陷现象，指挥部立刻派出数十辆大卡车，载着人员和器材前去支援抢险。
    六日午夜和七日早晨，全市一百多万居民正在安静地甜睡中，突然风雨交作，松花江的洪峰也同时袭来，水位上升到一一九·六四公尺，十日上午十时，水位升高到一一九·七二公尺，超过了1932年洪水在松花江大桥桥墩上留下的水痕。1932年在这个时刻，哈尔滨市道里，道外市区已沉浸在洪水中。但是现在峰浪虽然猛烈地冲击着各处堤坝，但在数万防汛大军的保护下，市区里平安无事。全市防汛总指挥、市长吕其恩和中共哈尔滨市委的负责干部分头带着工程人员，冒着暴风急雨，到危急的堤防去指挥抢险。在这几天里，国务院和中央防汛总指挥部不断从外地调拨给哈尔滨市大批防汛器材，并且经常给省、市防汛领导机关打来长途电话，询问水情和给予指示。在这些日子里，防汛指挥部集中地体现了全市人民战胜洪水的坚定意志和国家对人民生命的无限关怀。
    在险堤上
    当洪水继续上升严重威胁哈尔滨的时候，在绵长数十公里的江坝上，日夜都有成千上万的人在紧张地加固加高堤坝，和准备抢险。在江南太平区有一条四千多公尺长的堤坝，背后有十多个工厂、三棵树火车站和大量居民，它是全市几处最险要的堤段之一。虽然在洪水袭来前的五天里，已经有近万人日夜轮流在这里进行了加固加高堤防，全堤普遍加高、加厚了一公尺多，在十分险要的地方加了三、四公尺。太平区区长洪衷是这个堤的抢险总指挥，他虽然已经三天三夜没睡觉了，但仍然坚持在大堤上指挥抢险。来自各工厂的抢险工人们，发现险情后，立即把土袋子堵在快要塌决的堤脚下。罐头厂的女工们也参加了抢险斗争，她们和男工一起跑步把土袋子运到堤上。前进蔬菜生产合作社的一百多名社员，已经轮班在堤上坚守了四昼夜，三天不曾睡觉的社主任、共产党员石克义，带头下水打木桩，带领社员们把险些决口的一段险堤堵住了。
    在各处的险堤上，人们就是用这种忘我的精神，同洪水做斗争。
    防汛生产两不误
    “防汛、生产两不误！”这是哈尔滨市人民在和洪水做斗争中提出的战斗口号。七日，记者访问了紧靠着松花江的国营哈尔滨毛织厂，看到江水已在工厂的十几公尺外堤坝内翻滚着浪花。堤坝上运送防汛物资的汽车不停地奔驰，人们正在紧张地把一袋袋砂土垒起来加固堤坝，但工厂的高高的烟囱里仍和平日一样冒着滚滚的浓烟，从厂房里传出机器的转动声。这个厂的副厂长潘锡辉，是本厂的一位老工人。他告诉记者说，1932年松花江涌出的洪水，曾淹没了这个工厂。洪水袭来的时候，工人都没来得及逃出去，只好都挤在二层楼上，三个月内没能生产。
    这次，虽然江面上的水位已经超过了1932年，但是我们还在生产，在各个车间里，工人们正在努力完成八月份的生产计划，争取这个月比七月份多生产一倍的格子毛毯。在和洪水斗争的日子里，哈尔滨市绝大多数工厂，都和毛织厂一样，烟囱照常冒着烟，机器不停地在转动。
    商店营业如常
    在洪峰来临的日子里，市内营业如常，商业集中的靖宇大街，和往常一样，各商店顾客盈门，人们在细心地挑选着衣料、鞋子、家具、食品和玩具等货物。街上卖水果和冰棍的流动小贩，高声地在叫卖。
    记者访问了哈尔滨市最大的公私合营百货商店——同记商场，这个商店的经理刘实秋曾经历过1932年那场水灾，他说那时候这条繁荣的大街是一片汪洋，要出门得从二层楼窗子乘船。那时，主要市区都被淹没了，商店都停业一、两个月，物价猛涨，给人民带来了一场巨大灾难。后来，他又骄傲地说到这次和洪水做斗争的情形，他说这次洪水的威胁，没有影响营业和人民生活。几天来商场营业情况完全正常。八月以来的头几天，每天卖钱额都在一万三千元左右，比七月份每天的营业额还提高了四千到五千元，这是因为这个期间正是职工们领到增加的工资，纷纷到商店来买货。记者观察了营业室里货架上各种货物，所有商品的标价都和以前一样没有改动过。
    江堤下的居民
    1932年首当其冲被大水淹没的道外新市场、钱塘街和东市场十几条大街小巷，这些天里和往日一样热闹。街心的花圃里，盛开着各种鲜艳花朵。有哈尔滨“天桥”之称的新市场、钱塘街一带，游人仍然熙来攘往。这里的黑龙江省民间艺术剧院门前的海报上，预告日夜两场上演的节目。在新市场街同里，好几个茶社里都挤满听说评书、说相声的人。几位经历了1932年洪水灾害的居民，向记者追述当时堤坝决口的情形，那年也是八月上旬，有一天天还没放亮，他们正在睡梦中的时候，江堤决了口，汹涌的洪水飞快地淹没了沿江的几条街道。临江居民张老太太的板房子灌满了水，他们一家四口人爬到房顶上住了一个多月。现在住在东市场三十三号楼上的六十八岁的古云老太太，说她当时只好从二层楼上上船，摇着舢舨出门买菜、取水。这些亲身遭受过洪水灾难的居民，现在都安静地住在自己的家里。那位姓张的老太太还特地领记者去看江堤，从堤坝上俯瞰她住的房子。堤坝比她住的房子还高，房子的门窗完全被堤坝遮住了，江堤给这些居民形成了一道屏障。
