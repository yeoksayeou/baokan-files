Xinhua News Agency, Qinhuangdao, August 3rd – The largest glass manufacturing plant in China, the joint state-private Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory, is undergoing expansion. The restoration project of Furnace No. 1, which accounts for over 80% of the total expansion project of the factory, has been completed and officially put into production on August 1st.

The expansion project of this factory began in May of last year and is expected to be fully completed in November of this year. By then, the factory's output will increase by 1.4 times compared to the present.

The joint state-private Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory has a history of over thirty years. Its flat glass and frosted glass products are not only sold domestically but also exported to countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia. The factory's负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) told reporters that building a new glass manufacturing plant of the same scale as the existing one would require five times more investment and more than two years to complete compared to the expansion project. After the expansion project is completed, it will only take one and a half years to earn back the entire investment of the expansion project.

    新玻璃熔窑投入生产
    新华社秦皇岛3日电　我国规模最大的玻璃制造厂——公私合营秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂正在扩建。占全厂扩建工程总量80％以上的一号熔窑的恢复工程已经完工，在八月一日正式投入了生产。
    这个厂的扩建工程是在去年五月开始的，预计在今年十一月份全部完工，到那时全厂产量将比现在提高一点四倍。
    公私合营秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂已经有三十多年历史，出产的平板玻璃和磨砂玻璃不仅行销国内，还远销印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国。这个厂的负责人告诉记者，如果新建一座和现有厂同样规模的玻璃制造厂，需要比扩建工程多五倍的投资和二年多时间才能建成。在扩建工程完成以后，只要一年半的时间就能赚回全部扩建工程的投资。
