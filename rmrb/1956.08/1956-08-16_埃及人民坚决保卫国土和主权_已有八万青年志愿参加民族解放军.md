Xinhua News Agency, August 15th, Cairo Dispatch: Egyptian Minister of Education and Commander of the Egyptian National Liberation Army, Hussein, said at a meeting of university professors on August 14th that 80,000 young people have volunteered to join the Egyptian National Liberation Army.

	Hussein said that National Liberation Army units are being established in every province to accelerate the training of volunteers.

	On the same evening, Hussein said at a gathering of military training officers: "The Suez Canal issue is a matter of life and death for us and for the Arab countries. Our struggle with the imperialists is a long and continuous struggle, and this struggle has become even more vividly revealed since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company. We must have a standing armed force to repel the ambitions of the imperialists who are always trying to dominate the Middle East."

	He said: All students from the three national universities in Egypt will receive military training this summer together with the National Liberation Army. All students in middle and primary schools will receive military training next year.

	The Deputy Secretary-General of the Egyptian National Liberation Army, Ibrahim Tahawi, said that within a month, one million volunteers will be ready to take up arms to defend Egypt's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

	He said that this sacred struggle is built on a very solid mass foundation.

	Tahawi also said that we are prepared to establish military training centers throughout Egypt. The first training center began operations on August 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: According to a TASS report from Cairo on August 14th: The Egyptian people support and endorse the Egyptian government's position on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company.

	A conference of Egyptian intellectuals was held in Cairo on August 13th. The meeting was attended by 25,000 union members, teachers, doctors, journalists, lawyers, engineers, scientific workers, and members of various university groups.

	The resolution passed at the meeting stated that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is in line with Egypt's national interests and is a legitimate and necessary step to ensure Egypt's complete autonomy. The resolution also pointed out that any attempt by foreign countries to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs under the pretext of Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company will be regarded as a blatant violation of Egypt's sovereignty and freedom.

	On the same day, a mass rally was held in Giza to support the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. The Minister of Education and Commander of the National Liberation Army, Kamal el-Din Hussein, spoke at the meeting, emphasizing that at present, all the Egyptian people are united around the government led by President Nasser.

	The Egyptian Trade Union Federation issued a statement announcing that Egypt will hold a general strike on August 16th to protest against "various conspiracies and attempts by Western countries to re-influence and dominate our free country."

    埃及人民坚决保卫国土和主权
    已有八万青年志愿参加民族解放军
    新华社15日讯　开罗消息：埃及教育部长、埃及民族解放军司令侯赛尼八月十四日在大学教授的会议上讲话的时候说，已经有八万青年志愿参加埃及民族解放军。
    侯赛尼说，每一省都正在建立民族解放军部队，以加速对志愿人员的训练。
    同一天晚上，侯赛尼在一个军训官员的集会上说：“苏彝士运河问题是一个对我们以及对阿拉伯国家生死攸关的问题。我们和帝国主义者的战斗是一个长期而不断的战斗，在埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后，这种战斗就更为生动地显露出来了。我们必须有一支常备的武装力量，以击退总是竭力想统治中东的帝国主义的野心。”
    他说：埃及三个国立大学的全体学生今年夏天将和民族解放军一道受军训。中等学校和小学校的全体学生将在明年受军训。
    埃及民族解放军的副秘书长易卜拉欣·塔哈维说，在一个月内将有一百万志愿人员准备好手执武器来保卫埃及领土的完整和主权。
    他说，这个神圣斗争是建立在非常巩固的群众基础之上的。
    塔哈维又说，我们已准备在埃及各地建立军事训练中心。第一个训练中心已在八月十三日开始工作。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社开罗十四日讯：埃及人民拥护和支持埃及政府在苏彝士运河公司国有化问题上所采取的立场。
    开罗八月十三日举行了埃及知识分子大会。参加会议的有两万五千名工会会员、教师、医生、记者、律师、工程师、科学工作人员和各大学团体的人员。
    会上通过的决议说，苏彝士运河公司国有化是符合埃及的民族利益的，这是保证埃及完全自主的合法和必要的步骤。决议还指出，外国想借口埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定来干涉埃及内政的任何企图，都将被认为是对埃及的主权和自由的明目张胆的侵犯。
    同一天吉萨市举行了一个群众集会，支持苏彝士运河公司国有化。教育部长、民族解放军司令卡迈勒丁·侯赛尼在会上讲了话，他着重指出，目前，全体埃及人民都团结在纳赛尔总统领导的政府的周围。
    埃及工会联合会发表了一项声明，宣布埃及将在八月十六日举行总罢工，以抗议“西方国家想要重新影响和统治我们的自由国家的各种阴谋和企图”。
