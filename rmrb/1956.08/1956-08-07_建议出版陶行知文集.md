    Suggestion to Publish a Collection of Tao Xingzhi's Works
    In recent years, we have seen the publication of collections and complete works of many revolutionary martyrs, such as "The Complete Works of Wen Yiduo," "The Collected Works of Qu Qiubai," "The Complete Works of Tan Sitong," and "The Collected Works of Taofen," all of which have been well-received by readers. However, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, who had a broad influence in Chinese education, has not yet had his collection of works published.
    From 1916, when Mr. Tao Xingzhi began his work in education at Southeast University, to 1927, when he founded "Xiaozhuang Normal School" in Nanjing, to 1939, when he founded " Yucai School" in Chongqing, and to 1946, when he founded "Social University," his thirty years of practical activities and important works have had a great influence on the history of education in China and on the history of the democratic movement in China. In order to smoothly carry out the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in academic research, to facilitate everyone's in-depth study of Mr. Tao Xingzhi's academic thought, and to draw correct conclusions on the historical evaluation of Mr. Tao Xingzhi, I hope that relevant units will prepare and print "The Collected Works of Tao Xingzhi," and hope that someone can write a complete biography for him, so that more people can conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study of his life and thought. Commemorating a deceased person is actually an encouragement to millions of living people, and publishing "The Collected Works of Tao Xingzhi" as soon as possible is the best way to commemorate him.

### 建议出版陶行知文集

    建议出版陶行知文集
    这几年中我们已经看到许多革命先烈的文集和全集：像“闻一多全集”、“瞿秋白文集”“谭嗣同全集”“韬奋文集”等，都已经继续出版了，这都是受到读者欢迎的。但是在中国教育界有广泛影响的陶行知先生，却一直未见有他的文集出版。
    陶行知先生自从1916年开始在东南大学致力于教育事业，到1927年在南京创办“晓庄师范”，1939年在重庆创办“育才学校”，到1946年创办“社会大学”，三十年间的实际活动和重要著作，在中国的教育史上，在中国的民主运动史上有着很大的影响。为了顺利地开展学术上的“百家争鸣”，为了便于大家对于陶行知先生的学术思想作深入的研究，为了对陶行知先生的历史评价得出正确的结论，我盼望有关单位筹印“陶行知文集”，并希望有人能为他写出一本完整的传记，使更多的人能对于他的生活思想进行全面深刻的研究。对于一位死者的纪念实际上是对千百万生者的鞭策，能够早日印行“陶行知文集”是纪念他的最好的方式。　李士钊
