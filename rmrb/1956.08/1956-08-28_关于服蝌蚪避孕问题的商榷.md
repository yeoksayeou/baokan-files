    Discussion on the Issue of Taking Tadpoles for Contraception
    Since Mr. Shao Lizhi introduced the folk remedy of taking tadpoles for contraception in his speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress, the Beijing Daily also interviewed Dr. Ye Xichun, the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who originally provided this remedy. He affirmed the "reliable and dependable" nature of this folk remedy. After the newspaper published his interview, newspapers in various regions reprinted it, which aroused widespread attention from people of all social strata across the country, who regarded it as a blessing for "planned birth control." This is understandable.
    But is the issue really that simple? As an amateur researcher of traditional Chinese medicine, I have doubts. First, Dr. Ye Xichun did not explain the connection between tadpoles and the essence of conception, that is, he did not analyze it from a physiological and pharmacological point of view, telling people why taking tadpoles can prevent pregnancy. Second, we know that women's reproductive functions are closely related to various tissues of the body, and especially to menstruation. Therefore, although Dr. Ye said that the effectiveness of this folk remedy is as high as 95% based on his years of experience, he did not explain, based on his observations, the reactions of these women after taking it, such as whether their menstruation changed, whether their sexual function changed, and what the consequences of the changes were. Therefore, I can only say that his claim of "reliable and dependable" is unreliable and unscientific.
    Due to the long-term influence of feudal social morality, very few contraceptive prescriptions and medicines can be found in traditional Chinese medicine literature. As for the folk remedies circulating among the people, I have heard of three types, namely snails, river snails, and tadpoles. These three types of insects are not for internal use, let alone common medicines. Reliable records are lacking in medical books, but they share a common characteristic of being extremely yin and cold. We can infer from the opposite of "regulating menstruation and promoting fertility," and from Dr. Ye Xichun's mention in his interview that "traditional Chinese medicine contraceptive methods such as Liuwei Dihuang Wan with Phellodendron or Gentian Longdancao, which are very bitter and cold, are not necessarily completely effective," that the effect of taking tadpoles for contraception is a cold medicine, which has an inhibitory effect on reproductive function. If this assumption is correct, then I believe that the public release of this folk remedy does more harm than good. This is because taking tadpoles does not directly kill sperm or directly destroy eggs, so cold medicines are unlikely to have no other reactions, especially for people with asthenic-cold constitutions, which may lead to accidents. The story recorded by the Ming Dynasty writer Gui Youguang about his mother losing her life from eating river snails to prevent pregnancy can be taken as a warning. At the same time, the practice of treating all constitutions the same, regardless of whether they are deficient or excessive, fundamentally violates the traditional treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
    The introduction of this folk remedy is related to the health of millions of people and to the correct attitude towards fertility issues. Although Mr. Shao Lizhi hoped in his concluding remarks that the health departments would conduct research and then promote it, once it is publicized by newspapers, it is difficult to prevent people from taking it spontaneously (I heard that a factory is preparing to organize one hundred female workers to try it next spring). In order to be responsible to the people, I hope that this short article will be published in order to arouse in-depth research in the medical community and to draw relatively complete conclusions, so as to avoid avoidable mistakes and damages.

### 关于服蝌蚪避孕问题的商榷

    关于服蝌蚪避孕问题的商榷
    自从邵力子先生在全国人民代表大会第三次会议的发言中介绍了服蝌蚪避孕的单方之后，北京日报又访问了原提供这个单方的中医师叶熙春大夫，他肯定了这一单方的“稳当可靠”，报纸把他的谈话登了出来，各地报纸又纷纷转载，因此引起了全国各阶层人民广泛的注意，把它看作“有计划生育”的福音，这是可以理解的。
    问题是不是这样简单呢？作为一个业余中医研究者，在我看来，是有疑问的。第一，叶熙春大夫没有把蝌蚪同受孕的本质联系加以说明，也就是说：没有从生理上和药理上加以分析，告诉人们服蝌蚪为什么能够避孕。第二，我们知道妇女的生育机能同人体各个组织之间有着密切联系，同月经尤其息息相关，因此叶大夫尽管凭他的多年经验说这个单方的有效程度达95％，但是他没有根据他的观察说明这些妇女服用后的反应，例如月经是否发生变化？性机能有无变化？发生变化的后果如何？因此我只能说他说的“稳妥可靠”是不可靠的，是不科学的。
    由于中医长时期以来受了封建社会道德观念的影响，在医药文献上极少看到避孕方药。至于民间流传的单方，据我听到的就有三种，即蜗牛、田螺和蝌蚪。这三种虫类都不是内服药，更不是常用药，方书上缺少可靠的记载，但它们之间却有一个至阴至寒的共同性。我们从“调经种子”的反面来推论，以及叶熙春大夫在谈话中提到的“中医避孕方法如六味丸加黄柏或龙胆草大苦大凉之药也不见得完全有效”上，可以设想服蝌蚪避孕的作用是寒凉药，对生育机能起遏止作用。如果这一设想不错的话，那末我以为这一单方的公开提出是利少害多的。这是因为服蝌蚪既不是直接杀死精虫或直接破坏卵子，那末寒凉药下去就不可能不起其他反应，特别是虚寒体质的人就可能因而发生意外。明代文学家归有光记述他的母亲为了避孕吃田螺丧命的故事可以引为鉴戒。同时，不问虚实一体同行的做法是根本上违背中医的传统治疗方法的。
    这一单方的提出，关系到千万人民的健康，关系到正确对待生育问题，尽管邵力子先生在结语中希望卫生部门加以研究，然后推广，但一经报纸宣传，就很难阻止人们自发的服用（我就听到一家工厂准备在明年春天组织一百个女工来试验）。为了对人民负责，我希望将这篇短文刊载出来，以便引起医药界的深入研究，得出比较完整的结论，借以避免可以避免的错误和损害。　张遵时
