Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently decided to allocate more than 20,000 tons of chemical fertilizer in advance to support Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, which were severely hit by typhoons, for replanting or converting to late autumn crops.

These 20,000 tons are all quick-acting fertilizers. Currently, 4,000 tons have been transported to Zhejiang, and the rest are being actively organized for transfer. It is expected that all will be transferred by the end of August.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 18th: Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province are purchasing chemical fertilizers and applying them to farmland affected by the typhoon. In the Taihu Lake network area and along the Yangtze River, many agricultural cooperatives have applied chemical fertilizers to rice fields with poor growth and yellowing leaves after the storm. Agricultural cooperatives in Nantong and Yancheng prefectures sprayed phosphate fertilizer on cotton fields with better growth and applied quick-acting fertilizer containing nitrogen to cotton fields with weak cotton plants. In Baobei and Xianghua townships of Chongming County, two agricultural cooperatives saw their cotton plants recover after spraying phosphate fertilizer on more than 800 mu of wind-damaged cotton fields.

The Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has increased the allocation of more than 4.4 million jin of chemical fertilizer to the Suzhou Special District, which was loaded onto trains from Wuxi and Suzhou between the 12th and 15th and transferred to Wuxian and Wujiang, among other places, to supply farmers with topdressing for late rice. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also allocated more than 10 million jin of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer from the raw materials for manufacturing granular fertilizer to supply farmers in areas severely affected by the wind disaster. The 30 million jin of chemical fertilizer allocated by the state from Shanghai to Songjiang, Nantong, and other prefectures is also being transferred.

    两万吨化学肥料调运江浙灾区
    追施速效肥料的受灾作物有了转机
    新华社18日讯　全国供销合作总社最近决定提前调拨两万多吨化学肥料，支援遭受台风袭击较严重的浙江、江苏两省，供补种或改种晚秋作物之用。
    这两万多吨都是速效肥料。现在已有四千吨运到浙江，其余的也正在积极组织调运。预计到八月底可全部调运完毕。
    新华社南京18日电　江苏省各地农业社纷纷购买化学肥料，在遭受台风侵袭的农田里施用。太湖水网地区和长江两岸很多农业社，风后在长势差、叶子发黄的水稻田里追施了化学肥料。南通、盐城等专区的农业社在长势较好的棉田里喷了磷肥，在棉棵瘦弱的棉田里追施了含有氮素的速效肥料。崇明县堡北乡和向化乡有两个农业社，八百多亩受风害的棉田喷过磷肥后，棉花已经复苏。
    江苏省供销社增拨给苏州专区的四百多万斤化学肥料，已经在十二日到十五日由火车装运到无锡和苏州，转运吴县和吴江等地，供应农民给晚稻追肥。省供销社还从制造颗粒肥料的原料中拨出氮肥、磷肥一千多万斤，供应给受风灾较重地区的农民。国家从上海拨给松江、南通等专区的三千多万斤化学肥料，也正在调运中。
