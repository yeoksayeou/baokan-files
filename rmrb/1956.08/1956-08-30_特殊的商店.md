Some say: Anything that can't be bought elsewhere can be bought in Shanghai, and anything that can't be sold elsewhere can be sold in Shanghai. While this statement may be somewhat exaggerated, Shanghai's commercial division of labor is detailed, and its services are specialized. Among its more than 60,000 shops, there are indeed a number of special or rare shops. Most of them have decades of history and close supply and sales ties with all parts of the country. For a long time, the employees of these shops have possessed superb skills in the management of special commodities, and have also accumulated rich experience in serving the special needs of customers. Their business is an indispensable part of social life.

These shops have maintained their operating characteristics after the full-industry public-private partnership or conversion to state-owned enterprises this year. Precisely because of this, Shanghai, the largest commercial city in the country, continues to play a significant role in meeting the diverse needs of the people.

Colorful Opera Costume Shops

Guangdong Road is where Shanghai's opera costume shops are concentrated, with more than 40 shops lined up side by side. In their shop windows and stores, you can see Zhao Zilong's long armor, Yang Guifei's palace dress, Zhuge Liang's Bagua robe, as well as helmets studded with beads and unusually beautiful pheasant feathers...

These shops have been open for decades, the oldest, Xiang Tai Shun, has more than 100 years of history. The sewing technicians here not only have excellent skills, but are also proficient in various dramas, capable of making more than 1,000 kinds of opera costumes, hats, water makeup, bead flowers, boots, and fox tails. There are seventy or eighty kinds of beards alone. The materials used by the opera costume shops come from all over the country, and they maintain close relationships with famous Suzhou embroidery artists.

In recent years, opera costume shops have been serving as partners to theater troupes for their performances. Almost every shop has some photographs of famous actors from past generations. Famous actors such as Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Ma Lianliang, Gai Jiaotian, and Yuan Xuefen are all regular customers of these shops. They often receive orders from theater troupes all over the country. The more than 40 shops now have orders that will take until the second quarter of next year to complete, and they still cannot meet the demand even with round-the-clock work. Recently, the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe, led by the famous actor Zhou Xinfang, ordered more than 200 opera costumes here for performances of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea," and other plays, in preparation for overseas performances.

Many old-fashioned opera costume styles are gradually being improved. Various new patterns and designs have replaced the ferocious tiger heads and dragon patterns of the past. The chic and elegant shawls and ancient-style skirts worn by Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying in the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," after several beautifications based on the characters' personalities, appear even more beautiful on stage.

Diamond Polishing Shops Processing Diamonds

When people see a dazzling diamond, they rarely think that it was originally just an ordinary, shapeless crystal. It is only through the processing of diamond polishing shop technicians that it radiates its magnificent brilliance.

There are only 14 technicians in Shanghai engaged in diamond polishing, scattered in six shops. Now, some of them have become experts who are good at identifying diamond properties and possess first-class skills. These shops all have an electric grinding wheel, which the technicians use to grind diamond blanks into round, square, heart-shaped, and triangular jewelry diamonds and industrial diamonds. Their excellent techniques can make originally flawed diamonds become crystal clear and clean. One of the newest types of jewelry diamonds has 58 facets on the left, right, top, and bottom. When viewed through a magnifying glass, each facet looks like a petal, forming a blooming chrysanthemum, with shimmering light interlacing and changing endlessly. In recent years, these shops have polished many export diamonds for the country, earning a large amount of foreign exchange.

Nationally Rare Silk and Damask Shops

Several special silks and damasks and antique brocades needed for mounting calligraphy and paintings, letter fans, and books by famous figures of past dynasties are almost entirely supplied by two silk and damask shops in Shanghai. The silks and damasks supplied by these two shops are as thin as cicada wings and as beautiful as clouds, making the calligraphy and paintings more exquisite and possessing an elegant national style.

These two shops—Zheng Longchang and Yong Taichang—are located in alleys and have small storefronts, but they have close ties with more than 400 mounting shops and museums across the country. They understand the specifications and characteristics of silk and damask, and are familiar with its place of origin and sales channels. Every day, they receive a large number of purchase letters from all over the country. After these two shops implemented public-private partnership this year, orders have increased even more, and this rare silk and damask is now in short supply.

Lively Bird and Animal Shops

Walking into Shanghai's bird and animal shops is like entering a small zoo. In the birdcages, thrushes and canaries compete to sing; monkeys and rabbits are kept in wooden fences; glass boxes hold swarms of white mice; and some shops have large pythons as thick as bowls coiled in wooden basins. These seemingly small bird and animal shops supply the animals needed for experiments by hospitals, laboratories, and other units throughout the city. The 17 bird and animal shops in the Guangdong Road area alone supply more than 400,000 white mice, guinea pigs, toads, rabbits, and monkeys a year. They can find ways to supply whatever varieties and specifications of animals the hospitals need.

These shops often send buyers to deep mountains and dense forests in other provinces to purchase animals such as monkeys, pythons, pangolins, and golden pheasants, supplying zoos in various places. They also maintain supply and sales relationships with farmers in the suburbs who raise mice and rabbits.

Not long ago, more than 400 larks, canaries, thrushes, and mandarin ducks were shipped overseas, the largest batch supplied by Shanghai bird and animal shops to the Nanyang Islands and Singapore. According to the owner of a bird and animal shop called Zhou Taixing, overseas Chinese in that area love to raise these birds. In previous years, this shop also sold dozens of them there every year, but business has been particularly prosperous since this year.

Orthopedic Shops that Fit "Hands" and "Feet"

Disabled people who have lost their hands and feet can be fitted with artificial limbs at Shanghai's four orthopedic shops. These four shops have special workshops attached to them, which can use leather, aluminum sheets, wood, rubber, and other materials to make "long legs," "short legs," "long arms," and "short arms" for them according to the patient's height, joints, and degree of disability. People fitted with these "hands" and "feet" look almost like the real thing, and artificial hands can still hold books and newspapers; artificial legs can walk and ride bicycles. A "special leg" made for people who have lost one leg is attached to the buttocks and equipped with special switches and locks, allowing the patient to stand, sit, and walk as usual. In these shops, you can sometimes see patients who originally came in with crutches walking out smiling after being fitted with "legs and feet."

Orthopedic shops also make correctors for people with deformities, such as orthopedic shoes for clubfoot, flatfoot supports for flat feet, steel braces for hunchbacks, and stomach supports for the treatment of gastroptosis. These special devices can restore deformed areas to normal or compensate for their deficiencies.

Many patients from other provinces also write letters requesting artificial limbs. The shops often send personnel to hospitals and schools for disabled veterans in other places to take measurements and make patterns for the disabled. In the shops, you can often read letters of thanks from patients all over the country, some of which are accompanied by photos. Many people in the photos no longer show any signs of disability.

Silk and Satin Shops Buying and Selling Scraps

The public-private partnership Tong Xie Feng Silk and Satin Shop is the only shop in Shanghai that deals in silk and satin scraps. Customers can buy all kinds of scrap silk and satin here, and they can also sell their own unwanted materials to it, or exchange them.

This shop has been open for fifteen years, and it has ties with large silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, purchasing scrap or substandard materials from the factories. Whether it is silk, spun silk, or velvet, as long as the scrap is more than three inches, citizens can sell it to them. Not only do local silk, children's clothing, suit, opera costume, and embroidery shops often stock up from them, but people from all over the country, even as far as Tibet and Xinjiang, often come to this shop to purchase and match materials. Sometimes customers need a special pattern, and they can arrange for dyeing and printing on their behalf; if customers need a certain material, they can also purchase it on their behalf.

This year, after Tong Xie Feng implemented public-private partnership, the shop's operating characteristics have been retained, so business is very prosperous. To date, it has turned over more than 3,000 yuan in profits to the state.

Cleaning Shop with No Goods

Shanghai has such an interesting shop that it has no goods, but specializes in storing valuable winter clothing that is easily moldy and moth-eaten. This shop is called the Clean Storage Shop, and it was converted to state-owned two months ago. Now the shop has collected and stored more than 100 leather coats, suits, woolen clothes, and the like for customers. The shop has two special cold storage rooms, with blowpipes installed on the roof. The outdoor refrigeration compressor constantly blows cold air into the room. Not long ago, when the outdoor temperature in Shanghai rose to 34 or 35 degrees Celsius, the cold storage room was still very cool and dry, with the temperature maintained below 20 degrees Celsius. Storing fur and woolen clothes in such humidity and temperature prevents mold and moths from growing and multiplying, and also prevents fur clothes from yellowing and discoloring.

Waste Product Shops that Want Everything

The more than 1,400 waste product shops distributed in the small streets and alleys of Shanghai recover more than 300 tons of waste products every day. Their business policy is "I want anything that people don't want."

Some of the larger waste product shops have signed package purchase contracts with nearby factories and organizations, sending service personnel to assist in cleaning up warehouses on time, and then sorting out and pricing the discarded items; smaller ones have ties with peddlers who roam the streets and alleys, and the peddlers sell the waste products they collect from residents to them at any time.

Factory and organization scraps, fragments, and waste paper, residents' old clothes, scraps of cloth, old shoes, and old bottles, fish scales, shrimp shells, and bones from small vegetable markets, and hair from barbershops are the things they buy the most. Almost every shop has a workshop. After the waste products are purchased, they are sorted out. Some are sold for reuse, and some are sent to factories as raw materials. One waste product shop specializing in bottles, Fu Shun, buys and sells more than 2,000 old bottles every day. All kinds of glass bottles, even bottles that cannot be bought on the market, can be bought at this shop.

Shanghai has a large amount of latent waste products. These shops recover more than 4,000 tons of rags, about 2,000 tons of waste rubber, and 7,000 tons of miscellaneous bones a year. It is estimated that Shanghai barbershops cut down more than 1,100 kilograms of hair every day. After the waste product shops process it, it can be used as padding and fertilizer. Shanghai's annual exports of hair can be exchanged for about 1,900 tons of steel.

    特殊的商店
    新华社记者　穆青　叶世涛
    有人说：凡是买不到的东西在上海可以买到，卖不掉的东西也可以在上海卖掉。这句话虽不免有些过分，但是上海的商业分工细致、服务专门，六万多个商店中，的确有一批特殊的或者稀有的商店。它们大都已有数十年的历史，同全国各地有着密切的供销联系。长期以来，这些商店的从业人员在经营一些特殊商品方面有精湛的技术，在为顾客的特殊需要服务上也积累了丰富的经验。他们的营业是社会生活中不可缺少的一部分。
    这些商店在今年全行业公私合营或者改为国营以后，它们的经营特点仍旧被保持着。正因为这样，上海这个全国最大的商业城市，在满足人民各种各样需要方面，仍继续发挥着重大的作用。
    五彩缤纷的戏衣店
    广东路是上海戏衣店荟集的地方，这里并排开着四十多家戏衣店。在他们的橱窗和店堂里，可以看到赵子龙穿的长靠、杨贵妃的宫装、诸葛亮的八卦衣以及缀满珠子的头盔和异常美丽的雉鸡翎……。
    这些商店都开设几十年了，最老的一家祥泰顺有一百多年历史。这里的缝纫技师既有一手好手艺，又精通各种戏剧，能够做一千多种戏衣、戏帽、水妆头面、珠花、靴子和狐狸尾，光是胡子就有七、八十种。戏衣店所用的材料来自全国，并且和苏州一带的刺绣名手保持着密切的关系。
    这些年来，戏衣店一直是作为剧团的合作者来为他们的演出服务的，几乎每家店里都有一些历代名演员的剧照。全国著名的演员梅兰芳、周信芳、马连良、盖叫天、袁雪芬等，都是这些商店的老顾客。他们经常收到全国各地剧团的订货，现在这四十多家接到的订货要到明年第二季度才能做完，日夜赶工还满足不了需要。最近由名演员周信芳领导的上海京剧院，就在这里订制了演出“十五贯”“八仙过海”等戏的二百多件戏衣，准备出国表演。
    戏衣当中许多古老的式样正在逐渐改进。各种各样新颖的图案花纹，已经代替了过去张牙舞爪的虎头和龙纹。越剧“西厢记”里张生和崔莺莺身上潇洒清雅的披肩和古装裙，经过他们根据角色性格几度美化，在舞台上显得更加美丽动人。
    加工钻石的磨钻店
    当人们看到一颗光采夺目的金钢钻的时候，很少会想到它原来仅是一块不成形的普通的结晶体。只是经过磨钻店技师的加工，才使它放射出瑰丽多采的光辉。
    上海从事磨钻工作的技师只有十四人，分散在六个商店里，现在，他们中有的已经成为善于鉴别钻石性能、具有头等技术的行家了。这些店里都有一台电动的磨盘，技师们利用它把钻石毛坯磨成圆的、方的、鸡心的、三角形的首饰钻和工业钻。他们卓越的技术，可以使原来有污点的钻石变得晶莹洁净。有一种最新式的首饰钻，左右上下有五十八个面，从放大镜里看，每面就像一个花瓣，组成了一朵盛开的菊花，晶光交错，变幻无穷。最近几年来，这些商店为国家磨制了许多出口钻石，换回了大量外汇。
    全国稀有的绫绢店
    裱糊历代名人字画、笺扇和书册需要的几种特殊的绫绢和古锦，几乎全部都是由上海的两家绫绢商店供应的。这两个店供应的绫绢薄如蝉翼，美如云霞，用它们裱糊字画，使字画更加精致和具有优美的民族风格。
    这两个店——郑隆昌和永泰昌——开设在弄堂里，门面很小，但是他们却和全国四百多家裱糊店和博物馆有着密切的联系。他们懂得绫绢的规格和特点，熟悉它的产地和销路。每天他们都要收到来自全国各地的大批采购信。今年这两个店实行公私合营以后，订货的更加多了，这种稀有的绫绢现在已经供不应求。
    热热闹闹的鸟兽店
    走进上海的鸟兽店，就像一个小型的动物园。鸟笼里，画眉、芙蓉争相鸣啭；木栅栏里关着猴子和白兔；玻璃箱中养着成群的小白鼠，有些店的木盆里还盘有碗口粗的大蟒。这些看来规模很小的鸟兽店，却供应着全市医院、化验所等单位化验所需要的动物。光是广东路一带的十七家鸟兽店，一年就要供应四十多万只白鼠、豚鼠、蟾蜍、家兔和猴子。医院需要什么品种什么规格的动物，他们都能设法供应。
    这些商店经常派出采购员到外埠深山密林中去收购猴子、蟒蛇、穿山甲、锦鸡等动物，供应各地动物园。他们还和郊区养鼠、养兔的农民保持着供销关系。
    不久以前，有四百多只百灵、芙蓉、画眉和鵁凤等鸣禽，渡海出国，这是上海鸟兽店供应南洋群岛、新加坡一带最多的一批。据一家叫周泰兴的鸟兽店的主人说，那一带的华侨很喜爱饲养这些鸟类，往年，这家店每年也卖给那里几十只，今年以来，生意特别兴旺。
    配制“手”“脚”的整形店
    断了手、脚的残废人，可以在上海的四家整形店配上假手假腿。这四家店附设有特殊的工场，可以根据病人的身长、关节和残废程度，用皮革、铝片、木料、橡胶等为他们配制“长脚”、“短脚”、“长臂”、“短臂”。配上这些“手”“脚”的人，看起来跟真的差不多，而且假手同样可以拿书拿报；假腿可以走路、骑自行车。有一种给丧失一条腿的人装制的“特种腿”，按在臀部上，装着特殊的开关和锁，病人照样可站可坐，可以走路。在这些店里，有时可以看到原来拄着拐杖进来的病人，配好“腿脚”后笑容满面地走着出去。
    整形商店还为有畸形现象的人制作矫正器，例如跷脚用的整形皮鞋，平足病用的平足托，驼背用的钢挟背和治疗胃下垂病的胃托。这些特殊的器械可以让畸形部位恢复常态或者弥补它们的不足。
    许多外埠的病人也写信来要求配制假手假腿，商店常常派出人员去为外地的医院、荣誉军人学校的残废人量尺寸、打样子。在商店里经常可以读到各地病人写来的感谢信，有的还附来照片，很多照片上的人已看不出一点残废的样子。
    买卖零料的绸缎店
    公私合营同协丰绸缎商店是上海唯一经营绸缎零料的商店。顾客在这里可以买到各式各样的零碎绸缎，也可以把自己藏着不需要的料子卖给它，或者跟它交换。
    这家商店开设已有十五年，它和江浙一带的大丝绸工厂都有联系，收购厂里零碎的或不合规格的料子。市民的料子不论绸缎、绢纺、丝绒，只要在三寸以上，他们都收购。不但本埠的绸布、童装、西服、戏衣、绣品商店经常向他们配货，全国各地甚至远到西藏、新疆也常有人特地到这个商店来进货、配料。有时顾客需要一种特别的花样，他们可以代染代印；顾客需要某种料子，他们也能代为采购。
    今年，同协丰实行公私合营以后，商店的这些经营特点依然被保留着，因而生意十分兴隆，到现在，上缴给国家的利润已有三千多元。
    没有商品的清洁店
    上海有这样一家有趣的商店，它没有商品，专为人们保管霉季容易被霉蛀的贵重冬衣。这个商店叫做清洁保管商店，两个月以前改为国营。现在这个店已经为顾客收藏保管了一百多件皮大衣、西服、呢料衣服等。商店有两间特殊的冷藏室，房顶上装着鼓风管，室外的冷气压缩机不断地把冷风打进去。前不久，上海的室外温度上升到摄氏34、35度时，冷藏室里还是非常凉爽干燥，温度保持在摄氏20度以内。在这样的湿度、温度里贮藏皮货、呢料衣服，霉菌和蛀虫就不会生长繁殖，毛皮衣服也不会泛黄变色。
    无所不要的废品店
    分布在上海小街小巷的一千四百多个废品商店，每天回收的废品有三百多吨。他们的业务方针是“人家不要的东西我都要”。
    这些废品商店中，规模大一些的和附近的工厂、机关订立了包购合同，按时派出服务员到各单位协助清理仓库，然后把废旧的东西整理结价；小一些的同串街游弄的旧货摊有联系，摊贩们随时把从居民家里收购来的废品卖给他们。
    工厂、机关的下脚、碎料和废纸，居民家里的破旧衣服、碎布头、旧鞋和旧瓶，小菜场上的鱼鳞虾壳和骨头以及理发店中的头发，是他们收购得比较多的东西。几乎每个店都有工场，他们把废品收购来后，经过整理，有的卖出去重新使用，有的就送进工厂作原料。有一家专门经营瓶子的福顺废品店，每天买进卖出的旧瓶子有二千多只，各式各样的玻璃瓶，甚至市场上买不到的瓶子都可以在这个商店买到。
    上海的废品潜存量很大。这些商店一年回收的破布就有四千多吨，废橡胶约二千吨，杂骨也有七千吨。据估计，上海理发店每天剪下来的头发有一千一百多斤，经过废品店的处理，可以作衬垫和肥料，上海每年出口的头发大约可以换回一千九百吨钢材。
