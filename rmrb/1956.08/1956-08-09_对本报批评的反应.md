    Diesel Engine Parts Are Being Manufactured
    A letter from the Wuxi Second Bureau of Industry states: The situation reflected in the article "Let the Diesel Engines Run!" published in the People's Daily on July 4th is basically factual.
    In 1955, the Wuxi machinery industry faced a situation of "not having enough to eat," and needed to take on tasks. At that time, the provincial annual plan had not yet been issued, and we lacked foresight regarding the new situation. Therefore, we signed an agreement with the Geological Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry to supply diesel engine parts. Later, due to the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, the agricultural machinery manufacturing tasks allocated to us by the province increased sharply, and it was necessary to ensure that agricultural timing was not missed. In addition, the supply of materials was insufficient, so the diesel engine parts manufacturing task was squeezed out. Now, our bureau has taken measures to instruct the affiliated Power Machine Manufacturing Factory to manufacture some diesel engine parts.
    Faulty Switches Can Be Exchanged
    A letter from the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory states: The article "Small Electric Fan with a Malfunctioning Switch" published in the People's Daily on July 29th is completely accurate in its criticism of our factory. The pawl disc on the switches of our 16-inch table fans used to be made of imported bakelite powder. In 1955, due to a shortage of imported bakelite powder, we switched to using domestically produced bakelite powder. Because we were negligent during inspection and did not pay attention to mechanical strength, a batch of pawl discs were prone to cracking, causing the switches to malfunction. After we discovered this, although we took measures, some of the 16-inch table fans produced last year had already been fitted with these pawl discs of poor mechanical strength and were shipped out, making it impossible to recall them, causing losses to some users. We have now delivered 2,000 newly manufactured switches to the Shanghai branch of the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company for distribution to various regions. If users in various regions find that the pawl disc of a newly purchased 16-inch table fan (fan numbers between 53727 and 68726, with baked enamel covers) is cracked, they can bring the fan to the original purchasing company to exchange it for a new switch.
    Our factory is learning from this incident and is continuing to research ways to improve product quality. Recently, we have also changed the switch pawl disc to be punched from cloth-based phenolic laminate, which can completely eliminate the cracking problem.

专栏：对本报批评的反应

    柴油机配件正在制造
    无锡市第二工业局来信说：七月四日人民日报发表的“让柴油机开动起来吧”一文中所反映的情况基本上都是事实。
    1955年，无锡市机械工业存在着“吃不饱”的现象，需要承接任务。当时省内年度计划还没有下达，我们对新的形势缺乏预见，因此就与煤炭工业部地质勘探总局签订了供应柴油机配件的协议。以后由于农业合作化高潮到来，省内分配给我们的农业机械制造任务激增，而且要保证不误农时，加上材料供应不足，就把柴油机配件制造任务挤掉了。现在，我局已采取措施责成所属动力机制造厂制造部分柴油机配件。
    开关不灵可以掉换
    上海公私合营华生电器厂来信说：七月二十九日人民日报发表“开关失效的小电扇”一文，对我厂的批评完全属实。我厂出品的十六吋台扇的开关上的弹子盘，过去采用国外进口胶木粉压制，1955年由于进口胶木粉缺货，改用国货胶木粉，由于我们在检验时麻痹大意，没有注意机械强度，以致有一批弹子盘容易碎裂使开关失灵。后经发觉，虽已采取措施，但在去年出品的十六吋台扇中；已有一部分装置了这些机械强度很差的弹子盘出厂无法收回，使部分用户蒙受损失，现在我们已将二千只新造开关，陆续送交中国交通电工器材公司上海分公司转发各地。各地用户如新购十六吋台扇（台扇编号在五三七二七—六八七二六号之间，罩子是烘漆的），发现开关弹子盘碎裂时，可以将这种电扇携至当地原购公司掉换新开关。
    本厂汲取这次事件的教训，正在继续研究提高产品质量，最近又将开关弹子盘改用夹布酚醛板冲出，可完全消灭碎裂弊病。
