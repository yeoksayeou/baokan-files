Returning from a Visit to Japan
Ouyang Yuqian

The Chinese Beijing Opera Delegation's visit to Japan for performances was met with enthusiastic welcome from the broad masses wherever it went, causing a sensation unprecedented in the Japanese performing arts scene for the past sixty years. It is gratifying that artistic performances can enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Generally speaking, the Japanese are not unfamiliar with Chinese Beijing Opera. Mr. Mei Lanfang visited Japan twice in 1919 and 1924, and other Beijing Opera troupes have also been there since then. Moreover, many Japanese have visited China and most of them have seen Beijing Opera. In addition, there are many similarities between the performing styles of Chinese Beijing Opera and Japanese Noh and Kabuki, and the blood relationship between them is quite obvious. Therefore, the performance of Beijing Opera in Japan is different from that in Europe. Japanese audiences may have a stronger understanding of Beijing Opera, a deeper appreciation, and as fellow Orientals, they may feel closer to the art of their neighbors and find it easier to accept.

This Beijing Opera Delegation differed from previous Beijing Opera groups that went abroad in terms of lineup and repertoire. (1) In terms of lineup, Mr. Mei Lanfang is an artist of world renown in our country. His performing arts have unique achievements and are greatly welcomed by the broad masses everywhere. In addition to him, the other principal actors are also first-class young artists in our country, some of whom have just returned with honors from Europe and South Asian countries. Headed by Mr. Mei, this Beijing Opera Delegation is truly a perfect combination, complementing each other. (2) Drama is a collective art on stage, and the Beijing Opera Delegation demonstrated a high degree of collectivism, while each actor was able to independently think and create their own role, and complete the task given by a play, which is very rare. In the plays we performed, whether it was a small soldier or a palace maid, they were all played by actors skilled in acting. They often play a very small role after performing a lead role, and treat it as a lead role, without affecting the harmony and completeness of the art, which forms a high degree of unity of stage image, making each play have a perfect artistic style. (3) Actors must constantly strive for improvement in order to maintain eternal youth in their performance. The better a play is performed, the higher the mood becomes, the more refined the technique becomes, and the more the audience loves to watch it. This is the case with the Beijing Opera Delegation's plays. For example, Mr. Mei Lanfang, even though it is a familiar play that he has performed for decades, he never neglects it, and always calculates it in his mind, constantly discusses and studies it with others to revise it, even if it is a line or a small movement, he repeatedly deliberates to make it perfect. This spirit is also implemented in all the actors of the troupe. Everyone is extremely modest and has a strong desire to improve. This makes each performance feel fresh. (4) The content and form of the plays are healthy and full of vigor; the ideology and artistry are combined. For example, "The Drunken Beauty," originally only looked at some gestures, expressing only the bitterness of sex, and even some vulgar and erotic performances, after Mr. Mei's continuous revision, it has changed its face: the current "Drunken Beauty" uses Bai Juyi's poem about the people of Shangyang Palace to convey Yang Yuhuan's feelings. "Picking up the Jade Bracelet" and "Autumn River" praise free love, but without any erotic depiction. "Havoc in Heaven" expresses people's beautiful childhood. "Generals and Ministers Unite" expresses patriotism and the virtue of being brave in correcting mistakes. "Wild Boar Forest" describes Lin Chong being forced to go to Liangshan...

Because the many plays we performed are very artistic, there is no need to make any explanation or introduction to the content. The plot can be fully conveyed through song, dance and performing arts. Japanese audiences can understand the plot even if they do not understand Chinese. Generally, people feel that Beijing Opera is an ancient art, but the Beijing Opera of New China makes people feel full of youthful spirit. Prince Mikasa, the brother of the Japanese Emperor, said to me: "Beijing Opera is classical art, but your performance has a modern spirit." The famous director, Mr. Hijikata Tatsumi, asked me: "Originally, everyone thought that the performance of Beijing Opera was symbolic, but this time I see that your performance method is realistic. I think Yuan Shihai and several other actors' performances are like seeing the performances of famous European actors. Is this a phenomenon after the reform?" At that time, Mr. Takayama, who was next to him, replied: "Yuan Shihai has been abroad and has seen a lot of dramas. He may have been influenced by certain aspects of acting, but Chinese Beijing Opera originally had its own realistic tradition, and this tradition is profound." Mr. Hijikata Tatsumi added: "When I watched 'Farewell My Concubine,' I used binoculars to observe the expressions of each character on the stage from left to right and from right to left, even a small soldier or a maid was acting seriously, and appropriately without being excessive, which is very rare." I said: "That's right, this was not possible before. In the past, the play only looked at one or two protagonists, and the supporting roles were very casual, so that the protagonist could only express fragmented beauty from himself within a narrow range, and it was difficult to make a play a complete work of art. Now we pay attention to the unity of stage image and the integrity of art, so that the organizational structure of a play, the configuration of roles, the method and scale of performance, and the arrangement of song and dance are organically combined. In this way, both the protagonist and supporting roles are only working hard to accomplish the task given to him by the play, and the protagonist gets the support of collective strength, and can give more comprehensive play to his talents, and the play will be performed better and better." The members of the Beijing Opera Delegation grasped this point, and presented a new look. The youthful spirit and modern spirit mentioned by Japanese friends may mainly refer to this point.

A good performance of Beijing Opera must have a high level of technical skill. Beijing Opera actors must undergo long-term basic training and lay a solid foundation, otherwise they will not be able to master the complex and delicate dance movements. Beijing Opera actors must also be able to sing, act, and speak. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn to sing and speak lines, plus dancing and acting, it is indeed quite burdensome, so basic training is especially important. But today's actors must also have the cultural cultivation necessary for an artist, that is to say, a play must have its central idea, and then convey it to the audience through artistic performance. The performance of the Beijing Opera Delegation can attract a wide range of audiences, not only because it has healthy ideological content, but also because it has strong artistry, and its artistry is inseparable from its technical training in singing, acting, reciting, and dancing (fighting). But no matter how high the technical training is, its purpose is only to achieve the highest task of a play. As far as martial arts plays are concerned, it is not a simple performance of martial arts, nor is it different from acrobatics. It is to beautify the basic movements of Chinese martial arts and turn them into dances to perform a play. Beijing Opera's martial arts plays are always plays, and the drama is still quite strong. Although its dance is very strong, it is not dancing for the sake of dancing, and there are singing and reciting, which is different from Western ballet. Although it contains elements of pantomime, it would be wrong to say that its excellent parts and its characteristics are only pantomime; it would also be wrong to strengthen the pantomime-style performance and weaken other parts just to make it easier for foreigners to understand. How Chinese martial arts plays will develop in the future is not intended to be discussed here. In recent years, it is true that martial arts plays have been more integrated with the play. Another significant change is that in today's martial arts plays, the performances of various martial arts are intertwined and coordinated, and there are different organizations for performing different plays. Another point is that the new martial arts plays further develop the beauty of sculpture - and not only single-person sculptures, but also various group sculptures. Japanese artists have also seen this.

Plays like "Autumn River" and "Picking up the Jade Bracelet" can be understood without language, but they cannot be performed as pantomime. We still maintain the characteristics of combining singing, dancing, reciting, and acting. Facts have proved that in this way, people who understand the language are especially interested, and people who do not understand the language do not feel bored because of the singing and lines.

Like "Water Margin" and "Journey to the West," there are Japanese translations long ago, and they are almost household names in Japan. Therefore, audiences fully understand plays like "Wild Boar Forest" and "Havoc in Heaven." When Lin Chong and his wife separated, almost the entire audience shed tears. Although "Havoc in Heaven" is a mythological play, the audience does not feel that any part of it is unreasonable.

Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance in "The Drunken Beauty," the singing and body movements are beautiful and moving, which is generally acknowledged, but in the rich color, there is an unspeakable sorrow revealed from the clear singing and beautiful dance. I have met several Japanese performing artists and dancers, and they all have a deep impression on this point, and think it is extremely commendable. Moreover, the beauty's drunken state is slowly increasing little by little, and the sad mood is gradually increasing, and the singing is so soft and tactful, and the dance is so accurate and mellow, no wonder he is a world-renowned master.

This time we brought twenty-six programs, each with a different style and its own unique features. For example, with a single play like "Generals and Ministers Unite," "Picking up the Jade Bracelet," "At the Crossroads," and "The Drunken Beauty," after you finish watching one and then watch another, each one will give you a fresh feeling, and each artistic image is unified and complete, so the audience's mood is full from beginning to end. The Beijing Opera of New China intoxicated the Japanese audience.

The writer, Mr. Kotani Takeshi, talked about his impressions of watching the play and said: "I am not such a fragile person that I cry when I see others crying. Sometimes I laugh when I see tragedies, but when I see beautiful things, I can't help but be moved and shed tears..." He said that he thought the newspaper praised Beijing Opera too much. He went to see the play with the intention of finding fault. He intended to get a negative conclusion and walk out of the theater, but on the contrary, he was moved and shed tears. He said that Beijing Opera is really too beautiful. He also said that he had not read the instructions and had no "prior knowledge," but he could understand it after watching it. He said that some people say that Beijing Opera is like Japanese "Noh," like "Kabuki," like Western grand opera and operetta. He said that they may be a bit similar, but don't compare them. Beijing Opera is Beijing Opera. Professor Fujino Yoshio also said after watching Beijing Opera: "Four hours of intoxication, I have never felt so close to China in my life." A young man wrote a letter to Li Shaochun after watching the play, saying: "After watching 'Generals and Ministers Unite,' I felt a heavy weight; 'Picking up the Jade Bracelet' made me feel cheerful and pleasant; 'The Drunken Beauty' revealed Yang Guifei's complex loneliness in the beauty." He especially liked "At the Crossroads." He said: "That kind of bright, heroic rhythm deeply moved me... Before I saw it, I didn't know that there was such a good play in the world. How poor I am! After seeing it, I felt satisfied knowing that there is such a good play." - Endless praise, I have no way to convey them one by one. The Beijing Opera art of New China has indeed won the love of the broad masses of Japan and caused a sensation throughout Japan. Everyone is amazed by this unprecedented grand occasion.

The Beijing Opera Delegation was welcomed in Japan not only because of its artistic achievements. Of course, Chinese Beijing Opera has been reformed under the guidance of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," gradually removing certain dross and promoting the essence. It has made significant progress in recent years and presented a new look; but it must not be said that all the plays we perform are perfect - the past shortcomings are not completely overcome, and it is impossible to completely avoid conservative or rough biases in the process of reform. How to critically inherit the national heritage and promote excellent traditions, we have not done enough, and there are still many problems waiting to be solved. The realm of art is endless, and we must never be complacent because we are welcomed by the audience. The gain of this performance of the Beijing Opera Delegation in Japan is due to the fact that the Beijing Opera art of New China attracted the audience, and there is a more important factor, that is, the Japanese people's friendly concern for the Chinese people. The Japanese people often pay attention to every event in New China's economic and cultural construction, and every phenomenon of social change, and want to learn more about how the people of New China are in control of their own destiny and embarking on the road of independence, freedom, and democracy through all relations. They were extremely happy that they could see with their own eyes the artists of New China performing Chinese classical art in front of them and bringing the friendship of 600 million people to them amidst the heavy blockade. Last year, the Japanese Kabuki Troupe, headed by Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, brought the friendship of the Japanese people to China and was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people; similarly, the Chinese Beijing Opera Delegation's visit to Japan was also warmly welcomed by the Japanese people.

Whether from the historical, geographical, or long-term development prospects of the two countries, China and Japan have an eternally inseparable relationship in all aspects such as economy and culture. In order for the people of both countries to live a good life, it is necessary to seek true coexistence and co-prosperity. Therefore, peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation are in line with the wishes of the people of both countries. Japanese friends often tell us that no matter from which aspect, especially for the sake of Japan's independence, freedom and economic development, it is necessary to make friends with China. There is no doubt that China's peaceful policy and deep sympathy for the Japanese people have been widely recognized by the Japanese people. It is no accident that the Chinese Beijing Opera Delegation is called a peace envoy wherever it goes. The welcoming masses along the way are mostly those who do not have the opportunity to see the play, but they all wrote letters to express their admiration to us. A female student wrote a letter to us saying: "How I envy those girls who presented flowers to you! How lucky they are. I can't get the opportunity to be close to you. I only have one bright flower in my heart to offer to you!"

Welcoming the Chinese Beijing Opera Delegation, all levels of Japan showed a consistent attitude. The Asahi Shimbun, our host, made unusually cordial and thoughtful arrangements for us in terms of life and performance; Prince Mikasa, the brother of the Japanese Emperor, personally came to the backstage to see us; we were also received by the Japanese Diet; in all the places we went, the mayors of various cities, the chairmen of local councils, university presidents, professors, and well-known figures in the industrial, artistic, and academic circles organized grand welcome parties. At the welcome parties, there were gray-haired old men and women, as well as energetic and lively young men and women friends. Everyone scrambled to shake hands with us tightly. Their eyes, their attitude, and their conversations were so sincere, so genuine, and so full of enthusiasm! They gave us a large amount of flowers, as well as many precious souvenirs. For example, Inoue Yachiyo, a dancer from Kyoto (whose grandmother Inoue Yachiyo was a famous Japanese dance artist who died at the age of 101), gave Mr. Mei, the head of the delegation, a fan that her grandmother used at the age of 100.

We have visited many famous historical sites. The abbots in the temples, the residents in the villages, and the owners of the hotels all gave us solemn and courteous receptions. We also participated in the memorial service for the martyrs who were captured Chinese personnel, and also went to the tomb of the people's musician Nie Er to lay flowers. Representatives of the local government and the chairmen of the councils personally participated and delivered welcome speeches in these places. We also met some Japanese expatriates who had returned from China, and they held our hands tightly and shed tears of enthusiasm....

We also held several symposiums with the Japanese cultural circles. At each meeting, many people raised various questions. They wanted to know many things about New China, and we also hoped to satisfy their requests as much as possible, but each time we could not enjoy ourselves due to time constraints.

We did not perform in Kobe, but the citizens of Kobe - including overseas Chinese - held a grand welcome party for the delegation. Mr. Nakai Kazuo, the former mayor of Kobe, visited China last year. He delivered a speech on behalf of the meeting, earnestly hoping that the relations between China and Japan would be normalized. The mayor of Kobe hosted a luncheon for us in a scenic spot in the suburbs. After the banquet, Mr. Nakai Kazuo introduced us to visit the Mitsubishi Shipyard. The person in charge of the factory accompanied us all around the factory in a car for a week. This was a special reception, which is usually impossible.

At the welcome party in Nagoya, the national flags of China and Japan were hung, and dozens of children - the oldest were thirteen or fourteen years old, and the youngest were six or seven years old - played the Chinese national anthem and several songs such as "People of the World Are of One Heart" and "Tokyo-Beijing" on their violins. They were extremely neat and powerful, and everyone was moved by it. It is said that they practiced for more than two months specifically to welcome the Beijing Opera Delegation.

The above are just some brief descriptions, which can show the Japanese people's expression of friendship to the Chinese people. Now I want to talk about a few Japanese friends in more detail:

Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke is someone we all know. As soon as we arrived in Tokyo, we saw him and his wife. He invited us to watch the play. Mr. Mei, the head of the delegation, presented him with a bouquet of flowers. He introduced Mr. Mei to the audience on the spot, saying that Kabuki was warmly welcomed in China, and expressed his deep friendship to the Chinese people. He hosted a grand banquet at his home for all the members of our delegation. He and his wife greeted the guests with his brothers, sisters-in-law, sons, daughters-in-law, grandsons, and granddaughters. It was not yet July at that time. He erected a bamboo pole in the yard according to Japanese customs, and hung strips of five-color paper flowers on it. He and his family wrote their best wishes on the strips of paper. At the banquet, he raised his glass and gave a speech, first recalling the experience of Kabuki's performance in China last year with gratitude. He hoped that the cultural exchange between China and Japan would develop day by day, and the friendship between the people of the two countries would continue to increase. Finally, he pointed to the bamboo pole with five-color paper hanging in the yard, and said the wishes he had written on the paper in advance. He said: "Despite the Milky Way separating us, he hopes to be able to meet once a year like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl at least." When he spoke, his tone was very heavy, and his eyes were shining with tears. Everyone present was moved by his sincere feelings.

Japanese actors are very busy. They have to perform twenty-five days a month, two performances a day and night. Actors go to the backstage from 10:00 am and cannot finish until 10:30 pm. Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke was no exception. The remaining five days a month, because they have to prepare for performances in other cities, they cannot rest. When we performed in Fukuoka, Kyoto, and other places, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke's troupe followed us there. He always arrived there a day in advance, and he and his wife brought their children to the backstage to see us. Two days before we were about to return home, there was a reception and a farewell party. Because he had a play, he could not attend, but he still rushed to the end of the meeting after hastily removing his makeup. On the day we returned home, he had a late play the night before, and he had to rush to perform the daytime play that day, but he arrived at the plane at 6:00 am to wait for us. The plane was delayed for some reason that day. We did not arrive at the airport until almost 10:00 am, causing many friends who came to see us off (including Japanese friends and overseas Chinese) to wait at the airport for four hours. Until we got on the plane, a large group of people waved their handkerchiefs, some shook the flags of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and many people raised the five-star red flag and shouted "Goodbye!" Wishing us a safe journey. Also, the couple, Mr. Ennosuke's son Danshiro (Danshiro's wife is a very famous film actress), rushed to the hotel late at night to give us gifts. On the way, they had a car accident, and Danshiro's wife injured her face. At that time, after he sent his wife to the hospital, he still came to talk to us reluctantly for a long time. Their enthusiasm is really touching, and we are really uneasy. Fortunately, we heard that his wife's injury was not serious and would not leave any marks on her face. But the friends who saw us off at the airport waited so long in the hot weather and under the sun!

This time our visit to Japan, in addition to enhancing mutual understanding and further establishing friendly relations through artistic performances, had another purpose, which was to learn from friends in the Japanese art circles. Many friends collected materials for us, some photocopied rare books for us, and Mr. Nakamura Tadayuki personally transcribed the theater reviews of the Spring Willow Society's performance of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in Japan in 1907. Mr. Chida Koreya, Mr. Kinoshita Junji and other gentlemen collected a lot of drama materials for us. Among the friends in the dance community, several Noh experts accompanied us everywhere, and taught us a few pieces of Noh and Kyogen in their spare time, and also taught a few Japanese classical dances and folk dance programs. We also invited the Gagaku experts from the Imperial Household Agency and learned the dance of Lanling Wang Po Zhen Yue. We can be considered to have had a preliminary contact with Japanese classical art.

We have very few stage staff, and we rely entirely on the help of Japanese friends. Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke sent several of the most skilled professional cadres from the Kabuki-za, Mr. Chida Koreya sent a stage manager from the Haiyuza, and the Zenjinza sent a young actor and a young director. They not only manage design, production, and manage large and small props, they also help with staging, curtains, and help manage all the affairs backstage. For example, the two young men from the Zenjinza also helped manage the actors' snacks and tea in the backstage. These friends have good skills, good attitudes, and good work spirit. During the performance days, they never leave the backstage. When it comes to changing places to perform, they and our members work together overnight to install the stage until dawn. These young people do not talk casually, they just work sincerely and diligently. They are all healthy and lively, and extremely enthusiastic about studying their business. They also pay attention to the safety of our members at all times and protect them. We have established a deep friendship with each other after spending fifty-odd days and nights together. In addition, the backstage staff of the theaters in various places cooperated unusually harmoniously, and there has never been a single accident. Everyone in this industry knows that this is very rare. Even the front-desk service staff treated us very well. The manager of the Teito Hotel where we stayed in Tokyo personally went to the backstage every day to manage the food. In addition, the Asahi Shimbun sent several young female students who understood Chinese to take care of everyone's daily life very thoughtfully. In addition, the security personnel and car drivers were also assigned very well. In all the places we went, some male and female students voluntarily came to help with the consent of the Asahi Shimbun. We cannot forget the concern and assistance of these many friends mentioned above.

There are also our patriotic overseas Chinese, who welcomed the art delegation of the motherland with a lofty spirit of patriotism and the highest enthusiasm. They made great efforts to support the performance of the Beijing Opera Delegation. Several overseas Chinese joined the joint office of the Asahi Shimbun and the Beijing Opera Delegation. Because they were familiar with all aspects of Japan, they helped a lot. After the Beijing Opera Delegation arrived in Japan, they worked hard, rain or shine, day and night, and never stopped.

Japan and we have not established diplomatic relations. The Beijing Opera Delegation's visit for performances could not but encounter some complex and special situations. In addition to releasing leaflets and making shameless rumors and slanders, the reactionary side was always prepared to slander and harm us. The patriotic overseas Chinese, together with the security personnel, paid close attention to the safety of our members. In order to reassure the hosts, all the comrades in our delegation accepted the care of the Asahi Shimbun, took collective action when going out, and did not casually stroll on the streets. No matter who went out to do what, they explained it to the office in advance. Each member raised their vigilance and tried their best to ensure that unscrupulous elements had no chance to take advantage of. Thanks to the care and assistance of the Asahi Shimbun and friends from all walks of life, our performance was able to be completed smoothly.

This time, our members demonstrated a high degree of artistic enthusiasm and internationalist spirit, showing a selfless labor attitude, strictly abiding by discipline, being cautious in words and deeds; being kind and modest to people, working hard to learn, and striving to avoid arrogance and complacency. This also gave Japanese friends a good impression. The organization and planning of the delegation's office were relatively strict. Whether it was foreign affairs or the handling of daily life within the delegation - such as transportation, accommodation, and diet and hygiene - everything was orderly and guaranteed the performance.

Because of the Japanese people's sincere and deep friendship with the Chinese people, the enthusiastic support of many friends in all walks of life in Japan, and the assistance of patriotic overseas Chinese, coupled with our own efforts, the strength of all parties was gathered together to form a huge force, which enabled this visit and performance to Japan to proceed smoothly and end successfully. First of all, we should express our gratitude to friends from all walks of life in Japan. We hope that the cultural exchange between China and Japan and the friendship between the people of the two countries will be further developed and strengthened. We hope to continue to work together and redouble our efforts for this in the future. May the artists of the two countries join hands closely.

    访日归来
    欧阳予倩
    中国访日京剧代表团到日本作访问演出，所到之处受到广大群众热烈的欢迎，哄动一时，为日本演出方面六十年来未有的盛况。能够通过艺术表演增进两国人民的友谊，这是令人感到高兴的事。
    一般的说，日本人对于中国京戏不很生疏：1919年和1924年梅兰芳先生曾经两次到日本，此后也还有其他的京剧团去过；历来还有许多日本人到过中国，大多数看过京戏；加之，中国京戏和日本的能乐、歌舞伎的表演方式有不少类似之点，彼此之间存在血缘关系颇为显然。因此，京戏在日本上演和在欧洲不同：日本观众对京戏的理解力可能更强一些，欣赏力可能更深一些，同是东方人对近邻的艺术也可能感觉亲切而比较易于接受。
    这次京剧代表团在阵容、剧目各方面和过去出国京剧团体有所不同。（一）就阵容看，梅兰芳先生是我国有世界声誉的艺术家。他的表演艺术有独特的成就，在任何地方都受到广大群众的盛大欢迎。除他而外，其他的主要演员也都是我国第一流的青年艺术家，有的刚从欧洲以及南亚各国载誉归来。以梅先生为首的这个京剧代表团真所谓珠联璧合，相得益彰。（二）戏剧是舞台的集体艺术，京剧代表团发挥了高度的集体主义精神，而每个演员都能独立思考创造自己的角色，完成一个戏所给与的任务，这是很难得的。在我们所演的戏里，无论是一个小兵或是一个宫女，都是由善于演戏的演员担任的。他们往往演过一出正戏之后，赶扮一个极小的角色而把它当正角来演，又不妨害艺术的谐和与完整，这就形成了舞台形象的高度统一，使每个戏都具有完美无缺的艺术风格。（三）演员要在表演方面保持永远的青春，必须不断地力求精进。同样一个戏越演越好情绪就越高，技术也就愈加精练，观众也就会越看越爱看。京剧代表团的戏就是这样。像梅兰芳先生，尽管是他演过好几十年的熟戏，他也从来毫不忽略，随时随地拿来在心中盘算，不断和人讨论研究加以修改，那怕是一句台词，一个小动作，他认为不妥就反复琢磨以求尽善尽美。这种精神也贯彻到全团的演员。大家都极为虚心而进取之念很强。这就使每个戏演一次有一次新鲜的感觉。（四）戏的内容与形式都是健康的、有朝气的；思想性与艺术性相结合着的。例如“贵妃醉酒”，原来只看些身段，表现的只是性的苦闷，甚至于有些庸俗色情的表演，经梅先生不断修改之后便改换了面目：现在的“醉酒”是以白乐天咏上阳宫人那样对宫中妇女的同情来传达杨玉环的感情的。“拾玉镯”和“秋江”歌颂自由恋爱，但没有一点色情的描写。“闹天宫”表现了人们美丽的童年。“将相和”表现爱国精神和勇于改过的美德。“野猪林”描写林冲被逼上梁山。……
    由于我们所演的那许多戏艺术性都很强，所以用不着对内容作任何解释或介绍，通过歌舞和表演艺术就能充分传达。日本的观众就是不懂中国话也能体会剧情。一般都感觉到京剧是古老的艺术，新中国的京剧令人感觉到充满着青春的气息。日本天皇的兄弟三笠宫殿下对我说：“京戏是古典艺术，看你们的表演却有现代化的精神。”名导演土方与志氏问我：“原来大家都认为京戏的表演是象征性的，但这一次我看你们的表演方法是现实主义的，我看袁世海还有其他几位演员的表演，就好像看到欧洲名演员的表演，这是不是经过改革后的现象？”当时山尊在旁边回答他说：“袁世海到过外国，也看过不少话剧，在演技方面也可能受到某些影响，但是中国京戏原来也就有它现实主义的传统，而且这一传统是深厚的。”土方与志氏又说：“当我看‘霸王别姬’的时候，曾经用望远镜从左到右从右到左，反复观察台上每一个角色的表情，那怕是一个小兵、一个侍女都认真的在做戏，而且恰如其份毫不过火，这非常难得。”我说：“对的，这是以前所做不到的。以前的戏只看一两个主角，配角十分随便，这样就使主角只能在一个狭小的范围之内从他本身表现片断的美，很难使一出戏成为完整的艺术品，现在我们注意到舞台形象的统一性和艺术的完整性，这样就使一个戏的组织结构，角色的配置，表演的方法和分寸，歌舞的安排都有机的结合起来，这样不论主角配角都只是为了达成一个戏所给他的任务而努力，而主角得到集体力量的支持，就更能全面的发挥才能，戏就会越演越好。”京剧代表团的团员们掌握了这一点，就呈现了新的面目，日本朋友所说的青春的气息、现代化的精神，主要也可能指的是这一点。
    京戏的好的表演是必须有高度的技术水平的，京戏的演员都要经过长时间的基本训练，把底子打的很结实，要不然就不能够掌握复杂的又是很细致的舞蹈动作。京戏演员还要能唱、能做、能念。练会唱工和道白，已经要花很大很长的工夫，再加上舞蹈做工，的确相当繁重，因此基本训练特别重要。但是今天的演员还要有一个艺术家所必要的文化修养，也就是说，一个戏必定有它的中心思想，然后通过艺术的表演传达给观众。京剧代表团的表演所以能够吸引广大的群众，不仅是有健康的思想内容，还因为它有很强的艺术性，而它的艺术性是和它唱、做、念、舞（打）的技术锻炼分不开的。但是无论怎么样高度的技术锻炼，它的目的只是为达成一个戏的最高任务。就武戏而言，并不是单纯的表演武工，更不同于杂技，它是把中国武术的基本动作加以美化，成为舞蹈来表演一个戏的。京戏的武戏始终是戏，戏剧性还是相当强的。尽管它的舞蹈性很强，但并不是为舞蹈而舞蹈，而且有唱有念不同于西洋的舞剧。它尽管包含着哑剧的成分，但是如果说它的优秀部分、它的特点只是哑剧，那是错误的；如果只为着外国人容易懂，加强哑剧式的表演，而削弱其它的部分，也是错误的。中国的武戏今后如何发展，不打算在这里多谈。近几年来武戏更多的跟戏结合起来了确是事实。还有一个显著的变化，就是在如今的武戏中各种武功的表演，都是互相交错，互相配合，为着表演不同的戏，而有不同的组织。还有一点就是新的武戏，更进一步的发挥了雕塑美——而且不仅是单人造象，还创造出了各种的群象。这一些日本的艺术家们也都看出来了。
    像“秋江”、“拾玉镯”这样的戏，是不必通过语言就能看得懂的，但也不能就把它当哑剧来演；我们还是保持着歌、舞、念白，做工四者相结合的特点。事实证明：这样，懂话的人格外感到兴趣，不懂话的也并不为着有歌有白而感到沉闷。
    像“水浒传”、“西游记”，都早有日文译本，在日本几乎是家喻户晓的，所以像“野猪林”、“闹天宫”这类戏，观众完全明白，当林冲和娘子分别，差不多全场都掉眼泪。“闹天宫”尽管是一个神话戏，可是观众认为没有一处地方感觉不合情理。
    梅兰芳先生演“贵妃醉酒”，唱工、身段美丽动人，这是公认的，但是在浓艳之中含着一种说不出的哀愁从清歌妙舞中流露出来。我见到好几个日本的表演艺术家和舞蹈家，他们都对这一点有深刻的印象，认为极其难能可贵。而且贵妃的醉态是慢慢儿地一点一点增加，愁闷的心情也一步一步加重，而歌声又是那么清柔婉转，舞态又是那样准确而圆润，无怪其为世界名手。
    这回我们带去二十六个节目，每一个戏都有不同的风格，都有它独到之处。例如这样一单戏，“将相和”、“拾玉镯”、“三岔口”、“贵妃醉酒”，你看完一个再看另外一个，每一个都会给你以新鲜的感觉，而且每一个艺术形象都是统一的、完整的，所以观众自始至终情绪饱满。新中国的京戏陶醉了日本的观众。
    作家小谷刚氏谈他看戏的感想说：“我并不是看见人家哭我就哭这么一个脆弱者，有时看悲剧往往会笑出来，可是见了美的东西就不由得被感动而掉了泪……”他说，他认为报上把京戏捧得太过，他是怀着挑错的心情去看戏的，他满打算得一个否定的结论走出剧场，可是恰恰相反，他被感动流了眼泪，他说京戏实在太美了。他又说，他没看过说明书，毫没有“预备知识”，可是看了就能理解。他说有人说京剧像日本的“能乐”，像“歌舞伎”，像西洋的大歌剧、小歌剧，他说可能都有点像，但是不要拿来比，京剧就是京剧。还有一位教授藤野义雄氏看了京戏也说：“四个钟头的陶醉，在他一生中从来没有感觉到和中国那样亲近。”有一个青年看了戏以后，写信给李少春，他说：“看了‘将相和’感觉份量很重；‘拾玉镯’令人感到隽爽愉快；‘贵妃醉酒’在优美之中透露出杨贵妃复杂的孤独感。”他特别欢喜“三岔口”，他说：“那种明快，豪壮的韵律深深的感动了我……没看之先不知道世界上有这么好的戏，我是多么贫乏！看了之后知道了有这种好戏的存在，使我感到满足。”——无穷赞美的声音，我也没有法子一一传达，新中国的京剧艺术确是获得日本广大群众的爱好，哄动了日本全国，所有的人都对这种空前盛况感到惊异。
    京剧代表团所以在日本受到欢迎，并不仅是在艺术上的成就。当然，中国的京戏在“百花齐放推陈出新”的方针指导之下，进行了改革，逐渐去掉了某些糟粕，发扬了精华，这几年来有显著的进步，呈现出新的面目；但绝不能说我们所演的戏就都是十全十美——过去的缺点并不是说完全克服了，在改革运动的进行当中也不可能完全避免保守或是粗暴的偏向，如何批判的承继民族遗产，发扬优良传统，我们做的还很不够，还有不少的问题等待解决。艺术的境界是无穷无尽的，决不能因为受到观众的欢迎而自满。这一次京剧代表团在日本演出上的收获，一方面由于新中国的京剧艺术吸引了观众，还有更重要的因素，就是日本人民对中国人民友好的关怀。日本人民经常留意新中国在经济、文化建设方面的每一件事，和社会变革的每一个现象，很想通过一切关系更多的了解新中国的人民如何掌握着自己的命运，走上独立、自由、民主的道路。他们在重重封锁当中，能够亲眼看到新中国的艺术家在他们面前表演中国的古典艺术，同时把六万万人民的友谊带给他们，使他们感到异常高兴。去年以市川猿之助氏为首的日本歌舞伎剧团把日本人民的友谊带到中国，受到中国人民热烈欢迎；同样，中国京剧代表团访问日本也受到日本人民热烈的欢迎。
    中日两国无论从历史、地理和两国发展的远大前途看，彼此在经济、文化等一切方面有永远不可分离的关系。为着两国人民都能过好日子，必须求得真正的共存共荣。所以和平共处、友好合作是符合于两国人民的愿望的。日本朋友常对我们说，无论从哪方面看，尤其是为了日本的独立、自由和经济的发展，必定要和中国交朋友。无可怀疑，中国的和平政策和对日本人民深切的同情，已经相当普遍地为日本人民所认识。中国京剧代表团每到一处都被称为和平使节，不是偶然。沿途欢迎的群众，他们大都是没有看戏的机会的，但都写信向我们表示倾慕。有一位女学生写信给我们说：“我多么羡慕那些给你们献花的姑娘们啊！她们多幸运。我得不到和你们亲近的机会，我只有把我心里唯一的一朵鲜艳的花献给你们！”
    欢迎中国京剧代表团，日本各阶层表现着一致的态度。邀请我们的主人朝日新闻社为我们在生活方面和演出方面所作的安排异常亲切周到；日本天皇的兄弟三笠宫亲自到后台看我们；我们还受到日本国会的招待；所到各处，各市市长、各地议会议长、大学校长、教授与产业界、艺术界、学术界的知名人士等组织了盛大的欢迎会。在欢迎会上，见到的有白发苍苍的老先生、老太太，也有精壮活泼的男女青年朋友，每一个人都争先恐后和我们紧紧的握手，看他们的眼神、看他们的态度、听他们的谈话，都是那么诚恳那么真挚，那么富于热情！他们赠给我们大量的鲜花，还有许多珍贵的纪念品，例如：京都舞蹈家井上八千代，（他的祖母井上八千代是个日本有名的舞蹈艺术家，101岁才去世。）她把她的祖母在一百岁时用的一把舞扇赠给梅团长。
    我们游历过很多名胜古迹，寺院里的住持、村里的居民、旅馆的主人，都给我们以隆重和殷勤的招待。我们还参加了中国被俘人员殉难者的慰灵祭，还到人民音乐家聂耳的墓上去献花，在这些地方都有当地政府代表人和议会的议长亲自来参加，致欢迎辞。我们还遇到一些从中国回去的日本侨民，紧紧拉着我们的手，流下热情的眼泪……。
    我们还和日本文化界开过好几次座谈会，每一次的会都有很多人提出各种的问题，他们希望知道新中国的许多事情，我们也很希望尽量满足他们的要求，可是每一次都因时间限制不能尽兴。
    我们并不曾在神户演出，可是神户市民——包括华侨却为代表团开了盛大的欢迎会。前神户市长中井一夫先生去年访问过中国，他在会上代表致词，恳切地希望中日两国关系正常化。神户市长招待我们在郊外名胜处午宴，宴毕，中井一夫先生介绍我们参观了三菱造船厂，厂的负责人陪我们全体乘坐汽车在工厂里绕了一周，这是特别招待，平时不可能的。
    在名古屋的欢迎会上挂着中日两国国旗，有几十个少年儿童——最大的十三四岁，小的六七岁——拿着小提琴演奏中国国歌和“全世界人民心一条”、“东京—北京”等好几支乐曲，异常整齐而有力，大家为之感动。听说他们专为欢迎京剧代表团练习了两个多月。
    以上只是一些简略的叙述，可以看出日本各阶层对中国人民友谊的表现，现在我想就几位日本朋友再谈一谈：
    市川猿之助先生是我们大家都知道的。我们一到东京就看见他和他的夫人。他请我们看戏，梅团长献给他一束花，他当场对观众介绍梅先生，说歌舞伎在中国受到热烈欢迎，对中国人民深厚的友谊表示感谢。他在家里盛宴招待我们全体团员，他夫妇带着兄弟、弟媳妇、儿子、儿媳妇、孙子、孙女等全家迎接宾客。那时还没到七月，他照日本的旧俗在院子里竖起一根竹竿，在上面挂满一条条的五色花纸，他和他家人都把自己最好的愿望写在那一条条的纸上。在席上他举杯致词，首先以感谢的心情回忆了歌舞伎去年在中国演出的经过，他希望中日两国文化交流日益发展，两国人民的友谊不断地增进。最后他指着院子里挂着五色纸的竹竿，说出他预先写在纸上的愿望，他说：“尽管是银河阻隔，他希望能和牛郎织女一样，至少一年能够相会一次。”他说话的时候，语调很重，眼里闪着泪光，他那种真挚的感情，在座的人无不为之动容。
    日本的演员都是很忙的，每月要出演二十五天，每天要演日夜两场，演员从上午十点钟到后台，要到晚上十点半才能完事，市川猿之助先生也没有例外。每月剩
  下的五天工夫，因为要为到其他各城市演出作准备，也并不能够休息。我们在福冈、京都等处演出的时候，市川猿之助先生的剧团接着我们在那里上演，他总是提前一天到那里，和他的夫人带着儿女赶到后台来看我们。我们将近回国的头两天有一次招待会和一次饯别会，他因有戏不能参加，可是到会快完的时候，他还是匆匆忙忙卸了装赶来。我们回国那天，他头天晚上戏演的很晚，那天还要赶演日场，可是他清早六点钟就到飞机上等着我们，那天飞机因故迟开，我们将近十点才到飞机场，使得许多送行的朋友（有日本朋友也有华侨），在飞机场等候到四小时之久。一直等到我们上了飞机，大群的人有的挥着手巾，有的摇动着日中友好协会的会旗，还有许多人举起五星红旗，大声叫着“再见！”祝我们一路平安。还有就是头天晚上猿之助先生的儿子段四郎夫妇（段四郎夫人是很有名的电影演员），深夜赶到旅馆来送给我们礼物，在路上，撞了车，段四郎夫人伤了脸，当时他把他夫人送到医院之后，还来和我们依依不舍地谈了半天。他们的热情实在可感，我们心上实在不安，幸喜听说他夫人伤还不重，不致在脸上留下什么痕迹。可是在飞机场上送行的朋友，那么热的天，在太阳底下饿着肚子等那么长的时候！
    我们这次访问日本除了通过艺术表演增进彼此间的了解，进一步建立友好关系，还有一个目的，就是要向日本艺术界的朋友学习。许多朋友有的为我们搜集资料，有的为我们影印难得的书籍，还有像中村忠行先生亲手为抄录1907年春柳社在日本演“黑奴吁天录”的剧评。千田是也，木下顺二等各位先生为我们搜集了许多话剧资料。舞蹈界的朋友中有好几位和能乐专家一直跟随我们到各处，利用空闲时间教会了我们几个能乐和狂言的片断，还教会了几个日本古典舞蹈和民间舞蹈的节目。我们还请到了宫内省的雅乐专家，学会了兰陵王破阵乐的舞蹈。对日本的古典艺术也算有了初步的接触。
    我们的舞台工作人员很少，全靠日本朋友帮忙。市川猿之助先生从歌舞伎座派了好几位最熟练的专业干部，千田是也先生从俳优座派来一位舞台监督，前进座派来一位青年演员、一位青年导演。他们不仅管理设计、制作，管理大小道具，他们还帮着装台、司幕、帮着管后台一切事务。像前进座的两位青年还帮着管演员们在后台的点心和茶水。这些朋友技术好、态度好、工作精神好，在演出的日子里，他们一步也不离开后台。一到换地方上演，他们和我们的团员一同连夜赶着装台工作到天亮。这几位青年都不随便乱说话，就是诚诚恳恳埋头工作。他们都很健康活泼，钻研业务极为热心。他们还随时随地注意我们团员们的安全，加以卫护。五十几天朝夕相处，我们之间建立了深厚的友情。此外各地剧场的后台工作人员都合作得异常和洽，从来没有出过一点事故。干这行的都知道这是很难得的。就是前台的服务人员也待我们非常好。我们在东京所住帝都旅馆的经理，每天亲自到后台管理伙食。还有朝日新闻社派来几位懂中国话的青年女学生照顾大家的日常生活十分周到。此外还有警卫人员、汽车司机们都分配得很好。我们所到各处还有些男女学生经过朝日新闻的同意自动来帮忙。我们不能忘记以上所说这许多朋友们对我们的关心和协助。
    还有我们爱国的侨胞，他们以崇高的爱国主义精神，怀着最高的热忱来欢迎祖国的艺术代表团。他们尽了很大的努力来支持京剧代表团的演出。有几位侨胞加入了朝日新闻社和京剧代表团的联合办事处。他们因为熟悉日本各方面的情形，帮了很大的忙。京剧代表团到达日本以后，无论风里雨里、白天黑夜，他们辛辛苦苦工作，从来没有停过。
    日本和我们没有建交，京剧代表团去作访问演出不可能不遭遇一些复杂的特别情况。反动方面除了散放传单进行无耻的造谣污蔑之外，随时都准备中伤暗害。爱国华侨对我们团员们的安全曾与保卫人员共同加以严密的注意。我们全团同志为着使东道主人放心，接受了朝日新闻社的关照，出外采取集体行动，不随便到街上游逛。无论谁出去做甚么，都预先向办事处说明，每个团员自己提高警惕，极力做到使不良分子无机可乘，由于朝日新闻社以及各方面朋友的关怀和协助，我们的演出得以顺利完成。
    这一次我们的团员们发挥了高度的艺术热情和国际主义精神，表现着忘我的劳动态度，严格遵守纪律，谨慎言行；对人和蔼谦虚，努力学习，力戒骄傲自满。这样也给与了日本朋友以好的印象。团的办事处组织计划都较严密，无论对外交际、对团内的日常生活处理——例如交通、住宿以及饮食起居卫生方面都有条不紊保证了演出。
    由于日本人民对中国人民真挚深厚的友谊，由于日本各界许多朋友的热情支持，还有爱国侨胞协助，加上我们自己的努力，就把多方面的力量荟聚起来形成一个巨大的力量，才使这一次的访日演出得以顺利进行，完满结束。首先应当对日本各界朋友表示感谢。希望中日两国文化交流，两国人民的友谊更加发展、更加巩固。希望今后继续为此而共同加倍努力。愿两国的艺术家们紧密地携起手来。
