Xinhua News Agency, August 4th dispatch from Cairo: Ali Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Palace, issued a statement on the evening of August 3rd, stating that the communiqué of the British, French, and American talks in London attempts to obscure the truth by avoiding mentioning Egypt's rights.

In this statement, Sabri refuted point by point the joint communiqué issued by Britain, France, and the United States on August 2nd following the London talks. Sabri's statement pointed out that the joint communiqué was issued in an atmosphere where the Western powers, Britain, France, and the United States, were exerting pressure on Egypt and threatening the use of military force in an attempt to force the Egyptian people to submit.

Sabri said that the London communiqué states that the International Suez Canal Company will operate until 1968, but it fails to mention the fact that the canal is to be handed back to Egypt in 1968. "All this clamoring in London shows that these governments (Britain, France, and the United States) have no intention of allowing Egypt to recover the Suez Canal even after the expiration of the lease."

The London communiqué states that the International Suez Canal Company is of an international nature, but it fails to mention the fact that this company is an Egyptian limited company.

Sabri pointed out that the communiqué mentions the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement signed in 1954, but it does not mention the fact that Article 8 of this agreement stipulates that the Suez Canal is an integral part of Egyptian territory.

The London communiqué recognizes Egypt's "right to enjoy and exercise all the powers of a fully sovereign and independent nation." Sabri said that Egypt's nationalization of the International Suez Canal Company is an exercise of this right.

Sabri said that the communiqué's assertion that the nationalization of the International Suez Canal Company "involves the arbitrary and unilateral seizure by one country of an international institution" is untrue, because this company is an Egyptian company registered in Egypt and, according to Article 16 of the contract signed between the International Suez Canal Company and the Egyptian government in 1866, it is subject to Egyptian law.

The London communiqué insists that the nationalization of the International Suez Canal Company "is more serious in its implications because it is openly for the purpose of enabling the Egyptian government to make the canal serve solely the national interests of the Egyptian government" rather than international interests. Sabri pointed out that these two objectives are linked together, because there is no contradiction between Egypt's national interests and its importance as an international waterway.

In refuting the London communiqué's allegation that Egypt is forcing employees to work under the threat of imprisonment, Sabri said that the Egyptian government does not prohibit employees of the International Suez Canal Company from resigning, as long as they give prior notice in accordance with current regulations, giving ample time. But the government cannot tolerate anyone leaving immediately without notice, as this could hinder the effective navigation of the canal.

### 埃及当局驳斥英法美三国会谈公报  重申埃及收回运河是行使独立国家的权利

    埃及当局驳斥英法美三国会谈公报
    重申埃及收回运河是行使独立国家的权利
    新华社4日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府政治局局长阿里·萨布里八月三日晚上发表声明说，英、法、美三国伦敦会谈公报企图不谈埃及的权利以便混淆事情的是非。
    萨布里在这篇声明中逐点驳斥了英、法、美三国八月二日发表的伦敦会谈联合公报。萨布里的声明指出，联合公报是在企图迫使埃及人民屈服的西方三国对埃及施加压力、威胁使用军事力量的气氛中发表的。
    萨布里说，伦敦公报说国际苏彝士运河公司开办到1968年，但是它却不提运河要在1968年交还埃及的事实。“所有这些在伦敦的叫嚷说明这些政府（英国、法国和美国）甚至在租借期满后也无意让埃及收回苏彝士运河”。
    伦敦公报说国际苏彝士运河公司具有国际性质，但是它却没有提到这个公司是埃及的一个有限公司这个事实。
    萨布里指出，公报提到了1954年签订的英埃协定，但是它却不提这个协定第八条规定苏彝士运河是埃及领土的组成部分这个事实。
    伦敦公报承认埃及“享有和行使一个完全自主和独立国家的一切权力的权利”。萨布里说，埃及把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有就是行使这种权利。
    萨布里说，公报所说国际苏彝士运河公司的国有化“牵涉到由一个国家专横地片面地夺取一个国际机构的问题”，这是不真实的，因为这个公司是一个在埃及注册的埃及公司，根据1866年国际苏彝士运河公司同埃及政府签定的合同第十六条的规定，它要服从埃及的法律。
    伦敦公报硬说国际苏彝士运河公司国有化“在它的含意方面是更加严重，因为它公然是为了达到使埃及政府能够使这条运河单纯只为埃及政府的国家利益”，而不是为了国际利益服务的目的。萨布里指出，这两个目的是连在一起的，因为埃及的民族利益和作为一条国际水道的重要性是没有任何矛盾的。
    萨布里在驳斥伦敦公报中所谓埃及以监禁的威胁来强迫职员们工作这一点时说，埃及政府不禁止国际苏彝士运河公司的职员辞职，只要他们按照现行规则规定事先提出通知，给人充分时间。但是政府不能容忍任何人不提出通知就立即离去，因为这可能妨碍运河的有效航运。
