　　“Market conditions” was originally a term used in the commercial market, but now some people study academic questions and write articles while also watching for "market conditions."

　　For example, a book or an article is published, and for a month or two, no one publicly expresses any opinion. Is it that no one has read it? That's not necessarily the case. In non-public settings, one can hear "whispers" and "righteously indignant" voices, but not in writing, because they are waiting for "market conditions."

　　There are many sources for "market conditions": how a certain authority figure views it, how a certain editorial department views it, how a certain relevant unit views it, how Beijing views it, and so on.

　　Inquiring about "market conditions" is to ensure "writing articles" is safe, just like a merchant doing business who thinks that if they accurately inquire about the "market conditions" they can avoid losing money. Once the "market conditions" are ascertained, this book or article suddenly becomes the target of public criticism, or praise, or angry denunciation, and many newspapers and periodicals take the opportunity to make a commotion.

　　However, sometimes it is not so safe, because "market conditions" are not entirely accurate. Sometimes this "market condition" is overturned by that "market condition." Thus, those who act according to "market conditions" fall into an awkward situation, rack their brains, and are full of complaints:

　　"Can I be blamed for this? I originally had a basis." It seems to be justified. "Alas, writing articles is really difficult." It seems infinitely wronged.

　　This cannot help but remind people of Chekhov's short story "The Chameleon." The crime of a small hunting dog greatly troubled the police officer Ochumelov, who could not determine whether this dog was the general's or a wild animal? In other words, it was too difficult to determine the "market conditions" of this dog, sometimes "it is the general's," and sometimes it is a "baseborn creature." This official sometimes becomes indignant and wants to impose extreme punishment on this wild animal; sometimes he is gentle, declaring that the dog is a precious animal. This novel was written about the old Russia of decades ago. From the complaints of those who act according to "market conditions," one seems to hear the voice of Ochumelov again. Ochumelov naturally did not complain (he had already reached the point where he could calmly and freely do this or that). However, in that he had no interest in whether the dog bit someone, but only in determining the "market conditions" of this dog, it is the same as some people who have no research interest in how a book or article itself should be judged, but are keenly interested in waiting for "market conditions."

　　But in the end, one cannot avoid falling into an awkward situation. Waiting and waiting, rushing and rushing, one only earns a handful of worthless bonds, bounced checks—useless articles.

　　What to do? Complaining about heaven and blaming others is useless.

    论等“行情”
    李业
    “行情”本来是过去商业市场上的用语，但现在有的人研究学问、写文章也要看“行情”了。
    比如，一部书或一篇文章发表了，一月，两月，没有人公开发表什么意见。是没人读过吗？倒也不见得。在非公开场合，就能听到“窃窃私语”、“义正辞严”之声，但不见于文字，因为是在等“行情”。
    “行情”来源颇多：某权威人士如何看法，某编辑部如何看法，某有关单位如何看法，北京如何看法等等。
    打听“行情”，是为了“写文章”保险，就像商人做生意，以为打听准了“行情”就可以不致于赔本一样。一旦“行情”打听了出来，这部书或这篇文章，就突然成为众矢之的，或颂扬，或怒斥，不少报刊也趁机会热闹一阵子。
    然而，有时也并不保险，因为，“行情”并不全准确。有时这个“行情”被那个“行情”所推翻。于是，按“行情”办事的人，随之陷入了窘境，大伤脑筋，牢骚满腹：
    “这能怪得我么，我本来是有根据的。”似乎理直气壮。“唉，文章真是难写。”又似乎无限委屈。
    这不禁使人想起契呵夫的小说“变色龙”。一只小猎狗的罪行，使那位巡官奥楚蔑洛夫大大伤了一番脑筋，始终不能确定这只狗是将军的呢？还是野畜生？换言之，是这只狗的“行情”太难于确定，忽而“是将军的”，忽而又是个“下贱胚子”。这位官长忽而愤慨，要对这野畜生施以极刑；忽而又温柔，宣称狗是娇贵的动物。这小说写的是几十年前旧俄时代的事。从那些按“行情”办事的人所发出的怨言声中，却使人仿佛又听见了奥楚蔑洛夫的声音。奥楚蔑洛夫自然并没有发什么怨言（他是已经到可以坦然自若地忽而这样忽而那样了）。但是，就他对于狗是否咬了人并无兴趣，只是对于确定这狗的“行情”有兴趣这一点来说，却是同某些人，对于一部书或一篇文章本身究竟应如何判断并无研究的兴趣、却津津有味于等“行情”，竟如出一辙。
    但是，终于还是不免要陷入窘境。等来等去，赶来赶去，最后只赚了一把废债券、空头支票——无用的文章。
    怎么办呢？怨天尤人是没有用的。
