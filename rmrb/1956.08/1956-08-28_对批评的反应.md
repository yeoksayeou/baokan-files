Responses to Criticism

    Zhao Zhihong, the public factory director of the jointly owned public-private Shanghai Steel Window Factory, wrote: After the "People's Daily" published the article "A Strange Attitude Towards Private Personnel" on page four on August 9th, our factory immediately organized a discussion among Party members and cadres. Everyone unanimously believed that the newspaper's criticism served as a warning to us, and we realized that the root of our mistakes lies in our thinking and actions failing to keep up with the development of the situation. We have decided to organize all factory workers to study the newspaper's critical article and Comrade Li Weihan's speech at the National People's Congress meeting; at the same time, we will establish a schedule for the factory's administrative and business work, create necessary systems, conduct criticism and self-criticism in a practical and realistic manner, and especially listen attentively to the opinions of private personnel, proactively consult with private personnel on handling affairs, study problems, and provide them with strong support and assistance.

    In addition, regarding the examples cited in the article "A Strange Attitude Towards Private Personnel," we have two points to clarify: First, our factory accepted the task of producing Czech-style steel windows before the factory director and Party branch secretary went to Beijing for a meeting, not during the meeting. A factory affairs meeting was held before their departure to make arrangements, and it was pointed out that difficulties must be overcome to complete this task. Later, this work was indeed completed under the leadership of private representative Wang Yimin. Second, regarding the responsibility of the leading authorities, our factory was under the leadership of the East China Engineering Management Bureau at the time of the joint venture and until March 1955, after which it was transferred to the Metal Structure Bureau. Therefore, the responsibility for "the delayed arrangement of Wang's work" in the article should be divided between the two bureaus.

    对批评的反应
    公私合营上海钢窗厂公方厂长赵志宏来信：八月九日“人民日报”四版“对私方人员的奇异态度”一文对我厂提出批评后，我厂即组织党员干部进行了讨论，大家一致认为报纸的批评对我们敲起了警钟，认识到我们错误的产生，主要是思想和行动跟不上形势的发展。我们已经决定组织全厂职工学习报纸的批评文章和李维汉同志在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言；同时把工厂的行政业务工作按期订出计划，建立必要的制度，实事求是地开展批评和自我批评，特别是要虚心倾听私方人员的意见，主动地和私方人员商量办事，研究问题并给以大力支持和帮助。
    另外，对“对私方人员的奇异态度”一文所引的事例有两点说明：一、本厂接受捷克式钢窗任务，系在厂长和党支部书记去北京开会之前，并非开会期间，且行前曾召开厂务会议进行布置，并指出必须克服困难完成这项任务。后来这一工作确实是在私方代表王逸民领导下完成的。二、关于领导机关责任问题，按本厂合营时及合营后到1955年3月均属华东工程管理总局领导，其后始划归金属结构总局，故文中说“对王的工作迟迟不给安排”其责任是应该分属于前后两个局的。
