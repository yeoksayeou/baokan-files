    The Artistic Features of the Film "Heart of the World"
    Xie Liming

    "Heart of the World" is the first progressive West German film to be shown in our country. This film reflects the West German people's desire for peace and hatred of war by depicting historical subject matter. In today's political environment in West Germany, amidst the warmongering clamor of American war profiteers, the appearance of such a good film makes its political significance something that should first and foremost be given ample consideration.

    Bertha von Suttner was the organizer of the Austrian Peace Society founded in 1891, and the author of the novel "Lay Down Your Arms," which promoted the idea of peace. "Heart of the World" is a film created based on her historical materials.

    Turning the historical Bertha into the Bertha on the screen was an arduous artistic creation process. The film's creators brought into play the special qualities of cinematic art, skillfully utilized film art techniques, and brilliantly created the image of Bertha, a kind-hearted peace warrior who loved humanity.

    The first artistic characteristic displayed by the film is its bold and decisive tailoring of the material. This film narrates events that took place over a full fifty years, and in terms of the changes in its historical background, includes the turbulent years of European imperialist contention from the Austro-Prussian joint war against Denmark in 1864 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In terms of Bertha's own experiences, it includes her entire process from a naive aristocratic young lady to an anti-war writer, an organizer of the international peace movement, until her death. Organizing a film that can only be shown for ninety minutes from such broad, long, and extremely complex historical material, the first question that attracts attention is how the artists extract the essence from it and discard unnecessary things, that is, how to tailor the material.

    The film uses extremely delicate techniques to depict Bertha's sincere love with her first lover, Philo - the scene where Philo bids farewell to Bertha before going to war. However, the development of the story below does not dwell on Bertha's longing for her lover Philo on the expedition, nor does it go to the battlefield to capture any scenes related to Philo. The camera suddenly turns, and the war is over. Moreover, Philo's body quickly appears in front of Bertha, who is holding a bouquet of flowers to welcome her lover. However, in these few scenes, Philo's fear before going to war is profoundly excavated, showing Philo and Bertha's different attitudes towards war and their mutual ideological influence, as well as the starting point of Bertha's ideological transformation from praising war to hating war. Therefore, this bold tailoring does not give people a rough feeling. On the contrary, it makes the central idea of the film more prominent.

    There are many other instances of large-scale tailoring in the film. For example, after Bertha's husband, Arthur, went to war, the events that took place in the three years from 1866 to 1870 were omitted. After Bertha wrote "Lay Down Your Arms" and showed it to Arthur, the film jumped from 1873 to 1892. This kind of tailoring technique is originally a common feature of general biographical films; compared with other similar films, "Heart of the World" is more successful in that this tailoring makes the dramatic conflicts more concentrated and the central thread more prominent. Its choice of materials depends on the needs of the central thread. Among the myriad of historical materials, only those plots that are most closely combined with the center of the film are selected. Analytically, it should be said that the central thread of "Heart of the World" is composed of extremely complex contradictory factors - including: Bertha's struggle with the munitions merchant Zaharoff, who relies on war to get rich; Bertha's struggle with Arthur's blindly supporting war ideology; naturally including her ideological influence on Nobel, the engineer who invented dynamite; and her self-transformation, and so on. Therefore, we say that the "conflict" that constitutes the film is complex and sharp. And what the author chooses are mostly those plots that can fully express these contradictory relationships. For example, all the plots in the film where the munitions merchant Zaharoff appears are mostly the most able to express the contradictory relationship between Zaharoff and Bertha. All the plots in which Bertha's husband, Arthur, appears also mostly show the complex relationship in which Bertha's love and ideological contradictions are intertwined with him. In addition, the appearance of other main characters is mostly under the same circumstances.

    Precisely because the central thread is based on many plots containing contradictory factors, and precisely because the central thread and each individual plot are organically combined; therefore, this bold tailoring not only does not cut off the continuity of the story and make the story loose, but also makes the central thread appear particularly concentrated and particularly prominent. This is one of the important factors that makes this film an artistically extremely complete and unified work.

    The second artistic characteristic of "Heart of the World" is its richness in action. Not only does the connection of shots show a rhythmically clear action; the inner action of the characters is also particularly rich.

    Inner "action" is one of the basic rules of film art, and whether it is the characterization and imaging of characters or the development of conflicts, it is closely related to whether the film's artistic structure has action. Therefore, the "action" problem directly affects the artistic quality of the entire film. In "Heart of the World," it can be said that the author has made good use of this basic rule. Therefore, every scene makes people feel that the emotions are implicit and full, the meaning is profound and sharp, and the depths of the audience's hearts are shaken rhythmically from time to time.

    In the film, the munitions merchant Zaharoff wants to use money to buy Bertha, attempting to use this method to prevent the development of the peace movement in order to launch a war between France and Italy; the center of the action thread of this scene is built on the struggle between Bertha and Zaharoff, but the secondary character Arthur is also organized into this action. These few minutes are the great key to Arthur's transformation in his life. In these few minutes, he finally realized the cunning and insidious nature of the munitions merchants, and also realized the fundamental question of who the war is beneficial to. It cannot be said that the ideological content of this scene is extremely rich. However, here you can neither hear Arthur say a single conceptualized sentence expressing ideological transformation, nor can you hear Bertha's half sentence of preaching. The film completely uses the technique of depicting inner action to describe this content. When Zaharoff wants to buy Bertha with 50,000 pounds so that she "won't give a speech tonight," Arthur is extremely angry, but he does not use superficial language but uses action to express his indignation; he opens the door, signaling Zaharoff to go out. Later, when he faints due to the recurrence of his old illness because of excessive indignation, the viewer can better understand the complex content contained in this action.

    As for Bertha, in these few minutes, the inner action is even richer. On the one hand, the peace conference is waiting for her to attend and speak; on the other hand, her beloved husband suddenly faints. At this time, she must both rescue her husband's life and rush to the venue to work; at the same time, her hatred for war instigators is also heightened; here, Bertha's inner activities cannot be said to be even more complex. However, you cannot hear a single superficial line expressing her thoughts and feelings at this time. She hates Zaharoff, but she eagerly shouts to him: "Zaharoff! Call someone, quickly!"; people can understand from this how eager she is in her heart to rescue her husband's life. But she finally temporarily leaves her husband and runs to the chaotic convention hall; people can understand from this the concern for world peace that fills her heart and her high sense of responsibility for the safety of all mankind. Due to the richness of the inner action, when we appreciate this scene, we feel that our hearts and the hearts of Bertha and Arthur are resonating strongly; and we also feel that our hearts and the heart of Zaharoff are colliding fiercely with each other. It can be said without exaggeration that the film creators have led us to a new realm of artistic appreciation in these few minutes.

    The third characteristic of the film is that the theme is gradually deepened with the development of the characters' personalities.

    Bertha, who came from an aristocratic family, began to hate war because her own life was devastated by war. Later, seeing the great power of Nobel's experiment with nitroglycerin explosives, her horizons expanded, and she saw the world outside of herself. Until she gave her heart to the whole world and worked hard for the safety of all mankind. As a character, the film shows the process of her character formation. The film also shows the transformation of Arthur, who blindly supported the war, from opposing Bertha to admitting the peace movement. The film also shows the ideological changes of Nobel, the engineer, under Bertha's influence. Even Zaharoff, the film also shows the development of his increasingly strong resistance and sabotage of Bertha's peace movement. In short, the film creators have grasped the law of developing characters' personalities in the changes of struggle. And it is performed quite well.

    If we were not very clear at the beginning of the film what kind of war the author was opposing, then, as the relationship between Bertha and Zaharoff unfolded, we gradually learned that the war that the author was focusing on opposing was the imperialist war that munitions capitalists used to get rich. And this idea became gradually sharper with the exposure of Zaharoff's crimes. The film further expresses sharp political ideas through the development of the character of Bertha.

    "We are neither emperors nor prime ministers, neither can we sign treaties, nor can we participate in politics. But there is one thing we can do, you, you and I, we must wholeheartedly, with all our strength, hate war and love peace... Our team is not small, don't think that war and peace can only be decided by the government, the government relies on our support! We the people!" This is what Bertha said, and it should also be said to be the central idea of the film, that peace is decided by the power of the people.

    With the progress of Bertha's struggle with Zaharoff, the film more profoundly raises the attitude towards peace to the fundamental question of life. In order to sabotage peace, Zaharoff bought all the tickets for the peace lecture organized by Bertha in Berlin, so that no masses entered the venue when the meeting was held. At that time, the white-haired Bertha said contemptuously to Zaharoff: "How painful it is for you to be a person, Zaharoff, why do you live this life? What do you believe in? It is sin! You have lived a life in vain..."

    Zaharoff said proudly: "What do you believe in? It is kindness... Good! Has your belief been realized? No. It is not surprising, in this world, what is more reliable is... money, madam! Power, madam!"

    Bertha replied firmly: "It is love..."

    This is not a simple debate, but a eulogy to an attitude towards life and a criticism of another attitude; this point is very profound.

    The film further expresses the firm belief in the future of the peace movement with the development of the characters. In the few minutes before the aging and weak Bertha passed away, she saw in the train a woman sitting opposite bidding farewell to her son who was leaving for the front at the station. At that time, Bertha was very excited, and she asked the woman with concern: "Is that your son?" In their conversation, Bertha told the woman firmly: "I truly believe that peace, world peace... one day, it will be realized."

    This scene more centrally connects the belief in the peace movement with the love of human life; this idea cannot be said to be extremely valuable.

    "Heart of the World" is a film with very strong political ideas and very high artistic achievements. But there are also things that make people feel slightly insufficient. If the first few paragraphs of the film could make a clearer explanation of the reactionary nature of the two wars in 1864 and 1866 that the film criticizes, then it would avoid some viewers' misunderstandings. Because listening to the lines of Bertha's uncle and Arthur and his parents, these two wars both seem to be Austria's national self-defense wars. Therefore, it is easy to make people mistakenly believe that the film is even opposing just wars. In addition, if the images of other characters (such as Professor Gechisel, etc.) participating in the peace movement who are active around Bertha are portrayed more vividly, then it will add more color to both the ideological content and artistic quality of the entire film.

    影片“世界的心”的艺术特色
    谢力鸣
    “世界的心”，是在我国上映的第一部西德进步影片。这部影片通过对历史题材的描叙，反映了西德人民渴望和平、憎恨战争的愿望。在西德今天的政治环境下，在美国战争贩子鼓吹新战争的叫嚣声中，出现了这么好的影片，它的政治意义是首先应该予以足够的估价的。
    蓓泰·冯·苏特纳是1891年创立的奥地利和平爱好者协会的组织者，是宣传和平思想的小说“放下武器”的作者。“世界的心”就是根据她的历史材料创作的影片。
    把历史上的蓓泰变成银幕上的蓓泰，是一个艰辛的艺术创作过程。影片创作者们发挥了电影艺术的特长，熟练地运用了电影艺术技巧，出色地创造了蓓泰——这个心地善良、热爱人类的和平战士的形象。
    影片在艺术上所表现的第一个特点是：对于素材的大刀阔斧地剪裁。这部影片叙述了整整五十年间所发生的事迹，以其时代背景的变迁来说，包括了自1864年普奥联合对丹麦的战争直到1914年第一次世界大战爆发之间，欧洲帝国主义者互相争衡的动乱年代。以蓓泰本人的经历来说，则包括了她从一个思想幼稚的贵族小姐发展为反战的作家，国际和平运动的组织者，一直到老死的全部过程。以这样广阔、漫长而又极其复杂的历史素材组织一部仅仅能放映九十分钟的影片，首先引人关注的问题就是艺术家怎样从中汲取精华，抛弃不必要的东西，也就是说，怎样剪裁素材。
    影片用了极细腻的手法来描绘蓓泰同她的第一个爱人飞罗的真挚的爱情——飞罗在出征前向蓓泰告别的一场戏。但以下故事的展开并没纠缠在蓓泰对远征的爱人飞罗的思念上，也没有向战场上去摄取有关飞罗的任何场面。镜头忽然一转，战争已经结束了。而且，飞罗的尸体很快便出现在手持花束迎接爱人的蓓泰面前。但是，这几节戏里，却极深刻地挖掘出飞罗在出征前的恐惧心里，表现了飞罗和蓓泰对于战争的不同态度和相互间的思想影响，以及蓓泰从赞扬战争到憎恨战争的思想转变的起点。因此这种大刀阔斧的剪裁，并不使人产生粗糙的感觉。而且反倒使影片的中心思想更加突现出来了。
    大块地剪裁，在影片里还有多处。例如蓓泰的丈夫阿瑟出征之后略掉了1866至1870三年多时间里发生的事情。蓓泰写出了“放下武器”，把它交给阿瑟看以后，影片又由1873年跳到1892年。这样的剪裁手法，本来是一般传记片的共同特点；“世界的心”同其他同类影片相比，做得更成功的是这种剪裁使戏剧性矛盾更加集中，中心线索更加突出。它对素材的取舍，取决于中心线索的需要。在千头万绪的历史素材中，只选取那些同影片中心结合最紧的情节。分析起来，应该这样说：“世界的心”的中心线索是由极复杂的矛盾因素所构成的——其中包括：蓓泰同依靠战争发财致富的军火商人扎哈洛夫的斗争；蓓泰同阿瑟的盲目拥护战争的思想的斗争；自然也包括她对发明炸药的工程师诺贝尔的思想影响；以及她的自我改造等等。因此，我们说构成影片的“冲突”是复杂而且尖锐的。而作者所选择的，大都是能充分表现这些矛盾关系的那些情节。例如影片中所选择的所有军火商人扎哈洛夫出场的情节，便大都是最能表现扎哈洛夫和蓓泰的矛盾关系的。所有蓓泰的丈夫阿瑟出场的情节，也大都表现着蓓泰同他之间的爱情与思想矛盾互相交织着的复杂关系。此外，其它主要人物的出场，大部也是处在同一情况之下。
    正由于中心线索是以许多包涵着矛盾因素的情节为基础的，正由于中心线索同每一个个别情节都是有机地结合着的；所以这种大刀阔斧的剪裁，不但没有割断故事的连续性，使故事松散，反而使中心线索显得特别集中，特别突出。这是这部影片成为一部在艺术上极其完整、统一的作品的重要因素之一。
    “世界的心”在艺术上的第二个特点是富于动作性。不但镜头的衔接表现了节奏鲜明的动作性；角色内心的动作，也特别丰富。
    内在的“动作”是电影艺术的基本规则之一，无论是人物的性格化、形象化问题，矛盾冲突的发展问题，都与影片的艺术结构是否具有动作性有密切关系。因此，“动作”问题就直接影响着整个影片的艺术质量。在“世界的心”中，可以说作者很好地运用了这一基本规则。因此，每一段戏都使人感到情绪含蓄而又饱满，含义深刻而又尖锐，时时使观众内心深处引起有节奏的震动。
    影片中军火商人扎哈洛夫要用金钱收买蓓泰，企图用这种方法阻止和平运动的开展，以便发动法国和意大利的战争；这段戏的动作线索的中心，是建筑在蓓泰同扎哈洛夫的斗争上，但次要人物阿瑟也同被组织在这一动作之中。这几分钟是阿瑟一生转变的大关键。在这几分钟里，他最后认识了军火商人的奸诈阴险，也认识了战争是对什么人有利的根本问题。这段戏的思想内容不能不说是极丰富的。但是，这里你既听不到阿瑟嘴里说出一句概念化的表示思想转变的词句，也听不到蓓泰的半句说教。影片完全用刻划内在动作的手法来描绘这一内容。当扎哈洛夫要以五万英镑收买蓓泰，使她“今晚不要演说”时，阿瑟气愤极了，但他并不用表面的语言而用动作来表现他的激愤；他把门打开，示意叫扎哈洛夫出去。后来，当他因为过度激愤旧病复发昏厥过去的时候，观者更可以从这一动作里领会它所包含的复杂的内容了。
    至于蓓泰，在这几分钟里，内心动作更是极丰富的。一方面是和平大会在等待着她到会演讲；一方面是心爱的丈夫的突然昏厥。这时她既要抢救丈夫的生命，又要急于到会场上去工作；同时，对战争煽动者的仇恨情绪，也更加提高；这里，蓓泰的内心活动不能不说是更加复杂的了。但，你却听不到一句表现她此时的思想、心情的表面上的台词。她痛恨扎哈洛夫，但却急切地向他喊道：“扎哈洛夫！叫人，快！”；人们由此可以理解她内心中是怎样急于抢救丈夫的生命。但她最后还是暂离丈夫跑向纷乱的大会场去；人们从此可以理解她心中所充满的对世界和平的关怀以及她对全人类安全的高度责任感。由于内在动作的丰富，所以我们在欣赏这段戏时，感到我们的心和蓓泰、阿瑟的心在强烈地起着共鸣；也感到我们的心同扎哈洛夫的心在激烈地互相撞击着。可以毫不夸张地说，影片创作者在这几分钟里把我们引向艺术欣赏的新的境界。
    该片的第三个特点是主题思想随着人物性格的发展而逐步加深。
    贵族小姐出身的蓓泰，开始由于本身的生活受到战争的摧残，对战争发生了憎恶。后来，见到诺贝尔试验硝酸甘油炸药时的巨大力量，眼界展开了，看到自己以外的世界。一直到她把心交付给全世界，为全人类的安全去努力奋斗。作为一个人物来说，影片表现了她的性格的形成过程。影片也表现了盲目拥护战争的阿瑟，由反对蓓泰到承认和平运动的转变。影片也表现了作为工程师的诺贝尔在蓓泰影响下的思想变化。甚至，连扎哈洛夫，影片也表现了他对蓓泰的和平运动愈来愈强烈的反抗和破坏的发展状况。总之，影片创作者们掌握了在斗争的变化中发展人物性格这一规律。而且表现得相当好。
    如果说在影片的开头，我们还不能十分清楚地看出作者所反对的战争是什么性质的战争的话，那么，随着蓓泰和扎哈洛夫的矛盾关系的展开，使我们逐步了解到作者所集中反对的战争是那些军火资本家借以发财的帝国主义战争。而且这一思想，更随着对扎哈洛夫的罪行的揭露而逐步尖锐起来。影片更通过蓓泰这个人物的发展表现了尖锐的政治思想。
    “我们既非皇帝又非总理，既不能签订条约，又不能参与政治。可有件事我们能做，你、你和我，我们要全心全意，用一切力量，来憎恨战争，来热爱和平……我们的队伍并不小，别以为战争与和平只有政府才能决定，政府要靠我们支持！我们人民！”这是蓓泰所讲的话，应该说也是影片的中心思想，和平由人民的力量来决定。
    随着蓓泰同扎哈洛夫的斗争的进展，影片更深刻地把对待和平的态度提到人生的根本问题上来。扎哈洛夫为了破坏和平，将蓓泰在柏林组织的和平讲座的票全部包买下来，以致开会时没有一个群众入场。那时，白发苍苍的蓓泰对扎哈洛夫鄙视地说：“你做人多痛苦，扎哈洛夫，你这一生一世，活着为什么？你信仰的是什么？是罪恶！白活了一生……”
    扎哈洛夫却骄傲自得地说：“你信仰的是什么？是善良……好啊！你的信仰实现了？没有。这不奇怪，在这世界上，更可靠的是……金钱，夫人！权力，夫人！”
    蓓泰坚定地答道：“是爱……”
    这里不是一场简单的论战，而是歌颂着一种对人生的态度，批判着另一种态度；这一点是很深刻的。
    影片更随着人物的发展表现着对和平运动的前途的坚定的信念。衰老体弱的蓓泰离开人世前的几分钟里，她在火车上见到对坐的妇人向车站上的出征的儿子告别。当时，蓓泰心中非常激动，她关切地向那妇人问道：“是你儿子？”在她们的谈话中，蓓泰坚定不移地告诉那个妇人说：“我真相信，和平，世界和平……有一天，一定会实现。”
    这段戏更集中地把对和平运动的信念同对人类生活的热爱联系在一起；这种思想不能不说是极可贵的。
    “世界的心”是一部政治思想很强，同时又是艺术成就很高的影片。但也有使人略感不足之处。假如影片的前几段对于影片所批判的1864年和1866年两次战争的反动性质能作更清楚的说明，那么，便会避免某些观众的误会。因为从蓓泰的叔父和阿瑟及其父母等人的台词中听来，这两次战争都似乎是奥地利民族的自卫战争。因此，容易使人误认为影片连正义战争也在反对。此外，在蓓泰周围活动着的参加和平运动的其它人物形象（如格奇赛尔教授等）如果刻划得更鲜明些，那么，无论对整个影片思想内容和艺术质量都会更加增色。
