How I Spend a Sunday?

    The Ordeal of a Shirt
    Shan Fu
    My wife and I work in different organizations, so we can only live together one day a week. To make this day more enjoyable, we often make a small plan. For example, we might go boating at Beiling Park, or stay home to read books and wash clothes, enjoying a quiet day.
    This particular Sunday, our plan was: to go to the Shenyang Clothing Company in the morning to buy a shirt, go early and return early, and then spend the remaining time reading. At noon, we would cook something delicious ourselves and invite friends over to play.
    Afraid of the crowds, we arrived at the clothing company as soon as it opened. However, we searched the entire clothing company but couldn't find a silk shirt; they simply didn't have any. We went to the Joint Corporation, the Department Store… we ran to several large companies, worked up a sweat, but still couldn't buy one.
    With no other choice, we decided to buy fabric and make one ourselves. So we squeezed into the department store again, and with great difficulty, selected a piece of fabric we liked. We excitedly took it to the ready-made clothing department of the clothing company. Unexpectedly, they wouldn't make clothes with customer-supplied materials. We had to leave in disappointment.
    There are many sewing cooperatives on Taiyuan Street. Every time we entered a sewing cooperative, they would open the fabric, shake it, and then frown, saying slowly, "Sorry, we don't have fine needles, we can't do silk work!" Their tone and attitude seemed to be cast from the same mold.
    I suddenly remembered that last year, I had a shirt made in a private tailor shop on Middle Street. So we went to Middle Street again.
    It takes twenty minutes to get from Taiyuan Street to Middle Street by trolley bus. On Sundays, it's crowded, and we were squeezed like sardines in the bus, hardly able to breathe. After getting off the bus, we went straight to that tailor shop. We saw a sign hanging in front of the door: "Shenhe District First Sewing Production Cooperative." But they said, "Sorry, we only make men's shirts, not women's shirts!" Although the reason was different from the sewing cooperatives on Taiyuan Street, their frowning, slow, and deliberate tone and attitude were exactly the same. I recognized him as the person from the former private tailor shop. I couldn't help but wonder: why was he so friendly to customers in the past, but now that he is organized, he is so indifferent to customers? Seeing the anger on my face, he said to my wife in a softened tone, "You can go to Dahua Cooperative across the street, they specialize in making women's shirts."
    What else could we do? We had no choice but to hold that damned piece of fabric and go to the Dahua Sewing Cooperative that specialized in making women's shirts.
    As soon as we arrived at that cooperative, we heard a chorus of arguments. Several female comrades were indignantly pointing at the tailors and saying:
    "What is this? We've been running around like tops all morning, going from sewing cooperative to sewing cooperative all over the city, and we finally found your place, but you're pushing us away again..."
    "I already know your secret: you don't want to do silk work because it's hard work and takes time, so you fool customers and make them run around!"
    This must have been the right thing to say, because the tailor changed his tone and defended himself, saying, "Originally... besides... making a silk piece takes two or three times the work, and a regular shirt costs one yuan in labor, but there's no additional charge for silk work. We are paid by the piece, so who wants to do it?"
    At this moment, I suddenly understood.
    "You make it: we'll pay whatever the labor cost is, otherwise, our fabric will become waste!"
    After temporary negotiation, the labor cost for a silk shirt was two yuan and two jiao, more than double the cost of a regular shirt, but what else could we do?
    By the time we got home, it was already past 2:00 PM. Seeing the note left by our friend, I remembered that we had invited him for lunch and to spend the holiday together.
    The pick-up time for the clothes was the following Sunday. When my wife tried it on, it looked like she was wearing a Taoist robe. Obviously, it needed alterations. But the tailor said unhappily, "It was made according to the measured size, how could it not fit?" After more anger and arguing, they agreed to make alterations. We spent another unpleasant holiday!

### 一件衬衣的周折

专栏：我怎样度过一个星期日？

    一件衬衣的周折
    单复
    我和我爱人在两个机关工作，每星期只能同住一天。为了把这一天过得愉快些，我们往往定一个小小的计划。比如到北陵划划船，或在家里看看书，洗洗衣服，平平静静地过一天。
    这一个星期日，我们的计划是：上午到沈阳服装公司买件衬衣，早去早回，剩下的时间好看点书，中午自己做点好吃的，约朋友来玩玩。
    为了怕挤，服装公司一开门，我们就到了。可是我们走遍了服装公司，却买不到一件绸衬衣，根本没有这种货。我们又到联营公司，百货公司……连跑了几个大公司，弄得我们满头大汗，还没有买到。
    没办法，我们就只好自己买料子做了。于是又挤进百货公司，好容易选了一块合心的料子，兴冲冲地拿到服装公司的成衣部。没想到，他们不给做来料。我们只得败兴出来。
    太原街有许多缝纫合作社，我们每进一家缝纫合作社，他们都把料子打开来，抖一抖，然后皱着眉头，慢声慢气地说：“对不起，我们没有细针，丝绸的活不能做！”他们的声调和态度，仿佛是一个模子倒出来的。
    我突然想起来，去年，我曾经在中街有一家私人裁缝铺子里，做过一件衬衣。于是我们又到中街去。
    从太原街到中街，坐无轨电车得二十分钟，星期日人挤，我们像沙丁鱼似地在电车里挤得喘不过气来。下了电车，我们直奔那家裁缝铺子。一看，门前也挂上：“沈河区第一缝纫生产合作社”的牌子了。可是他们说：“对不起，我们是专做男衬衣的，不做女衬衣！”理由虽然与太原街的缝纫合作社不同了，但他那种皱着眉头，慢声慢气的声调和态度，却完全一样。我认出他就是过去那家私营裁缝铺的人，我不禁惊奇了：为什么过去他对顾客那么和气，现在组织起来了，反而对顾客这样冷淡呢？他看到我脸上的愤愤之色，用缓和的口气对我爱人说：“你到斜对面大华合作社看看，他们是专做女衬衣的。”
    这有什么办法呢？我们就只好再捧着那块该死的衣料，去找那家专做女衬衣的大华缝纫合作社了。
    一到那家合作社，我们却听见了一片吵架声。好几位女同志，正愤愤不平地指着裁缝师傅说：
    “你们这算什么呢？整个上午我们像走马灯，在全市的缝纫合作社转来转去，好容易才找到你们这一家，你们却又推……”
    “我已经知道你们的底细了：你们嫌丝绸活不好做，花工夫，就胡弄顾客，让他们转来转去！”
    一定是这话说对了，那位裁缝师傅才改变了声调，申辩说：“本来……再说……做一件丝绸活，得花二、三倍工，而普通一件衬衣是一元工钱，丝绸活却没有另订。我们是计件工资，这谁愿意做呢？”
    这时，我才恍然大悟。
    “你们做吧：要多少工资给多少，不然，我们的衣料都成废料了！”
    经过临时协商，一件丝绸衬衣是二元二角的工钱，比普通衬衣高一倍多，可这又有什么办法呢？
    回到家里，已经下午二点多钟了。看见朋友留下的条子，才记起我们是约他来吃午饭，共度假日的。
    取衣服的时间是下一个星期日。我爱人一试穿，却像穿了道袍。显然，不改是不成的。但那位裁缝师傅却不高兴地说：“是照量的尺码做的，怎能不合适呢？”又经一番生气和争执，才答应给改。这一个假日，我们又过得很不愉快！
