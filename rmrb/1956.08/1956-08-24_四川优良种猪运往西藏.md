Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 22nd: Four skilled pig farmers from Sichuan Province departed from Chengdu yesterday with a batch of excellent breeding pigs, heading for Tibet.

This is the first time that Sichuan Province has supplied excellent breeding pigs to the Tibetan region. They were loaded into two specially prepared large trucks, totaling seventy-four sows and ten boars. Among them are the famous Rongchang White pigs, Neijiang Black pigs, Yorkshire pigs, and Rongchang pig hybrids. These pigs grow quickly, mature early, can eat a variety of coarse feed, and can gain 200 to 330 jin of meat in a year; the sows also produce many piglets.

This batch of breeding pigs will be transported to the Tagong Pig Farm, located more than 400 kilometers south of Lhasa. The Tagong area has the best climate and abundant agricultural products in Tibet, making it suitable for pig farming. The Tagong Pig Farm will use these breeding pigs to breed a large number of fat pigs to supply the meat needs of Lhasa and other places, and gradually promote breeding to make them adapt to the plateau environment. Because pigs in the Tibetan region grow slowly, generally taking two years to slaughter, and also have less fat and thicker skin, the Tagong Pig Farm also plans to cross the excellent breeding pigs from Sichuan Province with local pigs to improve the quality of local pigs. This will promote the Tibetan people's self-breeding of pigs, and change the long-term situation of transporting processed pork from Sichuan Province over long distances.

### 四川优良种猪运往西藏

    四川优良种猪运往西藏
    新华社成都22日电　四川省四名养猪能手昨天带着一批优良种猪，从成都出发到西藏去。
    四川省供应西藏地区优良种猪，这还是第一次。它们装载在两辆特备的大卡车里。计母猪七十四只，公猪十只。其中有著名的荣昌白猪、内江黑猪、约克夏猪和荣昌猪的杂交猪。这些猪生长快，成熟早，能吃多种粗饲料，一年就能长肉二百斤到三百三十斤；母猪产仔也多。
    这批种猪将被运往住于拉萨以南四百多公里的塔工养猪场。塔工一带是西藏气候最好、农产品很丰富的地方，适宜于养猪。塔工养猪场将用这批种猪来繁殖大量肥猪，以供应拉萨等地的肉食需要，并且逐步推广饲养，使它们适应高原的环境。由于西藏地区的猪生长慢，一般喂两年才屠宰，同时脂肪少和皮厚，塔工养猪场还准备把四川省来的优良种猪和当地猪杂交，以提高当地猪的品质。这样，将会对藏族人民自繁自养生猪起促进作用，改变长期从四川省远道运输加工猪肉的局面。
