    Afanti's Stories
    Local Customs
    A guest from Turkey came and stayed at Afanti's house. After dinner, the guest saw grapes on the dish rack and said:
    “People in our place, people in our place,
    Always eat some grapes before sleeping.”
    Afanti wouldn't let him eat the grapes, saying:
    “People here aren't like that,
    Grapes are saved to be eaten in the morning.”
          Following the Crowd
    One day, Afanti went to the market, and his donkey was stolen by a thief. He didn't dare tell his wife when he got home, so he just said to her:
    "Wife! Today everyone at the market lost their donkeys. Sigh, let's not talk about it."
    His wife said:
    "If everyone lost their donkeys, there must be a reason. Where's your donkey?"
    Afanti said impatiently:
    "Really! Everyone lost their donkeys, could I just sit there and watch? I lost my donkey along with them."
          True Intention
    One day, Afanti took his donkey to the market to sell it. He handed the donkey over to the broker and sat down beside him. A buyer came over, intending to check the donkey's teeth. The donkey opened its mouth and bit the buyer. The buyer left, very dissatisfied, shaking his bitten hand. After a while, a second buyer came, intending to feel the donkey's legs. As soon as he rolled up the donkey's tail, the donkey kicked him. This buyer limped away too. The broker led the donkey to Afanti and said:
    "This donkey has a terrible temper. It either kicks people or bites them. No one would want such a donkey, even if it was given away for free."
    Afanti said:
    "I brought it here not to sell it at all, but to let everyone see the suffering it has caused me."
          Paying the Bill
    One day, Afanti went to a bathhouse. The people in the bathhouse looked down on him and gave him an old basin and an old towel. Afanti didn't say anything and went to take a bath. After washing, he gave twice as much money as everyone else and left. The people in the bathhouse were very surprised. They regretted being so impolite.
    A few days later, Afanti came to the bathhouse again. This time, the people in the bathhouse treated him very respectfully, giving him a new basin and a new towel. But after washing, Afanti only gave a little money. The people in the bathhouse asked him:
    "Why are you only giving so little money?"
    "This is for the money for the last bath!" Afanti said.
    "What about the money for this time?" the bathhouse people asked.
    "Wasn't it given when I washed last time?" Afanti said.
          Friends
    When Afanti was a judge, someone asked him:
    "Afanti, how many friends do you have?"
    "Now I have countless friends, but only after I am no longer a judge will I know how many friends I really have."

    阿凡提的故事
    乡　风
    从土耳其来了一位客人，住在阿凡提的家里。晚饭后，客人看见碗架上放着葡萄，就说：
    “我们那里的人喏，我们那里的人喏，
    在睡觉的时候总要吃上一点儿葡萄。”
    阿凡提不让他吃葡萄，就说：
    “我们这里的人不是这样的，
    葡萄都是留着到早晨吃的。”
          从　众
    一天，阿凡提赶集去了，他的搭子叫小偷偷走了，他回家不敢告诉他老婆，只对她说：
    “老婆！今天集上的人都把搭子丢了，唉，别提这些事了。”
    他老婆说：
    “都把搭子丢了，其中一定有缘故的。你的搭子呢？”
    阿凡提挺不耐烦地说：
    “你真是！所有的人都把搭子丢了，我能白白地坐在那儿看着吗？我也跟他们一块把搭子丢了。”
          本　意
    一天，阿凡提把驴牵到市上去卖。他把驴交给了经纪人，自己就到旁边坐着。一个买主过来，打算看看驴的牙口，这驴张口就把买主咬了一口。买主很不满意地甩着咬破的手走了。过了一会儿，又来了第二个买主，他打算摸摸驴腿。刚把驴尾巴卷起来，驴就踢了他一脚。这个买主跛着腿也走了。经纪人把驴牵到阿凡提的跟前，说：
    “你这驴的脾气太坏，不是踢人就是咬人，这样的驴白给都没有人要。”
    阿凡提说：
    “我把它带到这里来压根儿就没想卖，我为的是让大伙看看它给我的苦处。”
          付　钱
    一天，阿凡提去洗澡。澡塘子里的人都看不起他，给了他一个旧脸盆和一块旧手巾。阿凡提什么话也没说就洗澡去了。洗完之后，他比其它人多给了两倍的钱就走了。澡塘子里的人很为惊讶，他们很后悔不该做那样不礼貌的事。
    过了些日子，阿凡提又来洗澡。这一次澡塘子里的人对他很尊敬，给他新脸盆、新毛巾。可是阿凡提洗完了只给了一点钱。澡塘子里的人就问他。
    “你怎么给这么一点钱呢？”
    “这是给的上次洗澡的钱！”阿凡提说。
    “那这次的钱呢？”澡塘子的人问。
    “不是在上次洗的时候给了吗？”阿凡提说。
          朋　友
    阿凡提做喀孜的时候，有人问他：
    “阿凡提，你有多少朋友？”
    “现在我有无数朋友，但是只有在我不当法官以后，才能知道我到底有几个朋友。”
    （李提甫、乔家儒、陈桂兰、刘宗诚译）
