Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 6th - Pakistani Foreign Minister Chaudhry delivered a speech at a public gathering in Bogra, East Pakistan, yesterday. He said: Pakistan has never and will never allow the United States to influence Pakistan's foreign policy.

The Foreign Minister said that the supreme goal of Pakistan's foreign policy is to defend its vital interests and enhance its prestige abroad. To illustrate this point, he mentioned Pakistan's consistent support for the Arab cause on the issues of Palestine and Algeria. He said that the United States' opinions on these issues differ from Pakistan's.

When talking about the Suez Canal issue, Chaudhry said that Pakistan does not want to doubt Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal at this stage, but Pakistan is definitely very concerned about the issue of continuing to enjoy free shipping facilities without discrimination along with other countries. He welcomes the proposal to convene a meeting of relevant countries to seek a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue. He believes that whatever the solution, Egypt's interests can be fully guaranteed. He also said that Pakistan has always been friendly to Egypt in the past and will always be friendly to Egypt in the future.

The Pakistani Foreign Minister said that Pakistan's underdeveloped situation is very serious, so it is in great need of economic assistance.

When talking about the policy of neutrality, he expressed that he could not understand this philosophy.

In his speech, he defended Pakistan's participation in military blocs, saying that this was to strengthen itself in order to cope with unforeseen events that might endanger its security and freedom.

    巴外长乔德里发表演说
    不让美国影响巴基斯坦外交
    欢迎召开国际会议和平解决苏彝士运河问题
    新华社喀喇蚩6日电　巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里昨天在东巴基斯坦博格拉的一个公众集会上发表了演说。他说：巴基斯坦从来没有而且永远也不会让美国来影响巴基斯坦的外交政策。
    这位外交部长说，巴基斯坦外交政策的最高目的是要保卫它的切身利益和提高它在国外的威信。为了说明这一点，他提到了巴基斯坦在巴勒斯坦和阿尔及利亚问题上一贯支持阿拉伯人的事业。他说，美国在这些问题上的意见同巴基斯坦是不同的。
    乔德里在谈到苏彝士运河问题的时候说，巴基斯坦不想在现阶段怀疑埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的权利，但是，巴基斯坦肯定地十分关心它继续不受歧视地同其他国家一同享受自由航运便利这一问题。他欢迎关于召集有关各国开会来设法和平解决苏彝士运河问题的建议。他认为，不论解决的办法是什么，埃及的利益都能够得到充分的保障。他又说，巴基斯坦过去一贯对埃及友好，今后仍将永远对埃及友好。
    巴基斯坦外交部长说，巴基斯坦的不发达状况非常严重，所以非常需要经济援助。
    在谈到中立政策的时候，他表示他不能理解这种哲学。
    他在演说中为巴基斯坦参加军事集团辩解，说这是为了加强自己，以便应付可能会危害到自己的安全和自由的不测事件。
