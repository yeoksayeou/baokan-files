Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 24th. Workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the vast Gobi Desert can now buy what they need right at the construction site. Many new mobile stores have been established on the construction site.

    Braving the wind and sand, reporters visited the mobile stores at the Ninth Construction Zone. In the food section of the store, in addition to watermelons and cantaloupes, there were canned goods shipped from the Northeast, candies produced in Shanghai, and halal pastries specially supplied to minority workers; the general merchandise counters displayed more than 1,000 kinds of goods. When the reporters entered the store, the counters were crowded with construction workers and family members buying goods. Some were buying pens and blue ink, some were selecting leather shoes and shirts, and several family members who had come from afar were looking at silk quilt covers produced in Hangzhou.

    The staff of the mobile stores proposed the slogan "We serve wherever the railway is built." For more than a year, as the construction project progressed, they have moved five times in the Gobi Desert. Because the construction sites are very scattered, the staff of the mobile stores also often push carts loaded with daily necessities or carry goods bags to the tents more than ten miles away to serve the workers scattered in various construction sites.

    戈壁滩上的流动商店
    新华社兰州24日电  在大戈壁修筑兰新铁路的工人们，可以在工地上买到他们所需要的东西。工地上已经新建立了许多流动商店。
    记者冒着风砂，访问了第九工区工地上的流动商店。商店的食品部里除了西瓜和哈密瓜以外，还有从东北运来的罐头、上海出产的糖果和专门供应少数民族工人的清真点心；百货部货柜里陈列的商品共有一千多种。记者走进商店的时候，货柜前正挤满了购买货物的筑路工人和职工家属，有的在买钢笔和蓝墨水，有的在选购皮鞋和衬衫，还有几个从远道来的职工家属，在翻看杭州出产的绸被面。
    流动商店的工作人员提出“铁路修到那里，我们就服务到那里”的口号，一年多来，随着筑路工程的推进，在戈壁滩上迁移了五次。因为筑路工地很分散，流动商店的工作人员还时常推着装载日用百货的小车或背着货包，到十多里外的帐篷里去，为分散在各个工地的工人服务。
