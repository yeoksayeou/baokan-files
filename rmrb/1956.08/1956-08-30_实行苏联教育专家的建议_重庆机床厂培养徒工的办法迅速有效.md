    Implementing the Suggestions of Soviet Education Experts
    Chongqing Machine Tool Plant's Method of Training Apprentices is Rapid and Effective
    The training work is the responsibility of the workshop director, who signs teaching contracts with experienced masters and teachers, systematically lecturing apprentices on technical theory, and providing material rewards to the experienced masters.

    (Our newspaper reports) The Chongqing Machine Tool Plant, following the suggestions of Soviet education expert Comrade Buretov, has implemented the method of individually training skilled workers in production, enabling apprentices to quickly reach the level of skilled workers.

    The characteristic of this training method is that the workshop director is responsible for guiding the training of skilled workers. After the factory director assigns the training task to the workshop, the workshop director signs operation skills teaching contracts with experienced masters and basic technical knowledge teaching contracts with teachers. The contracts specify concrete requirements for both masters and teachers, fundamentally overcoming the previous phenomenon of no one in the workshop being responsible for training. Last June, this factory accepted the entrustment of the Municipal Labor Bureau to train forty apprentices. Due to the adoption of this training method, after skills assessment and grading, all have now reached the technical level of Grade Two or above.

    The combination of theoretical education and practical operation is also one of the main characteristics of this factory's training method. They do not necessarily distribute newly recruited apprentices to workshops to be used as production workers immediately. Instead, they first organize these new learners to study technical theory courses for a period of time, and then go to the workshop for practical operation, while continuing to study theory. Only after they have a certain amount of basic technical knowledge are they assigned to various workshops to follow experienced masters in on-the-job production. A group of junior high school graduates recruited by this factory in the first quarter of this year was trained using this method. The factory organized them to systematically study basic technical theory knowledge such as blueprint reading, technical mathematics, metal materials, tolerance coordination, and process technology. Therefore, shortly after arriving in the workshop, most apprentices were able to independently master the operation. They are currently preparing to take skills assessments to be promoted to skilled workers.

    This factory implements a piece-rate wage system, where those who do more work earn more wages. When masters teach apprentices, they inevitably have to take time out of production to guide the apprentices' operation, which affects the master's production, and income decreases accordingly. In response to this situation, the training method formulated by the factory administration also stipulates methods of reward. They give a compensation allowance of three, four, or five yuan per month according to the simplicity or complexity of the technology taught by the experienced master. Some masters teach more apprentices, and the compensation allowance is increased accordingly. For each additional apprentice, the compensation allowance is increased by 30%. If the experienced master achieves the training requirements stipulated in the contract on time or ahead of schedule, they will be given one-quarter or one-third of the total compensation allowance as a reward to the master. This greatly encourages the enthusiasm of experienced masters to teach apprentices. Xia Wenqing, a master in the metalworking workshop, is training six apprentices. (Chongqing Daily)

    实行苏联教育专家的建议
    重庆机床厂培养徒工的办法迅速有效
    培训工作由车间主任负责，同老师傅和教师订立教学合同，给徒工系统地讲授技术理论知识，给老师傅以物质报酬。
    本报讯　重庆机床厂按照苏联教育专家布列托夫同志的建议，实行了在生产中个别培训技术工人的办法，使徒工很快达到了技术工人的水平。
    这种培训办法的特点是由车间主任负责指导培养技术工人的工作。厂长把培训任务交给车间以后，车间主任就同老师傅签订操作技能教学合同，同教师订立基本技术知识教学合同，在合同中，对师傅和教师都提出具体要求，这就根本上克服了以往车间无人负责培训工作的现象。这个厂去年6月间，接受市劳动局委托代培训四十名徒工，由于采用这种培训方法，经过考工评级，目前已全部达到二级以上的技术水平。
    理论教育和操作实际相结合，也是这个厂培训办法的主要特点之一。他们对新进厂的徒工，不一定马上分发到车间当成生产工人使用，而是首先组织这些新学工学习一个时期技术理论课，然后再到车间实习操作，同时继续学习理论，待他们具备了一定的基本技术知识以后，才分配到各个车间和老师傅一道跟班生产。今年第一季度这个厂招收的一批初中毕业生，就是采用这种方法培养的，厂里曾经组织他们系统地学习了识图纸、技工数学、金属材料、公差配合、工种工艺等基本技术理论知识，因此到车间不久，绝大部分徒工就能单独掌握操作了，最近正准备考工升为技术工人。
    这个厂实行的是计件工资，谁多做活就要多得工资。师傅带徒弟，必然要抽出一定的生产时间来指导徒弟操作，结果影响了师傅的生产，收入跟着就会减少。针对这种情况，厂行政制定的培训办法中，也规定出奖励的方法。他们按照老师傅所授技术的简繁，每月给以三元、四元或五元的补偿津贴费。有的师傅多带徒弟，补偿津贴也相应增加。每增加一个徒弟，就增加补偿津贴30％。如果老师傅按期或提前达到了合同规定的培训要求，就再给予全部补偿津贴总数的四分之一或三分之一的金额，作为对师傅的奖励。这更大大鼓舞了老师傅带徒弟的积极性，金工车间夏文卿师傅就培养着六个徒工。　　（重庆日报）
