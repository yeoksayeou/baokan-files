Xinhua News Agency, August 28th. In recent years, a total of 5,720 kilometers of new waterways have been opened up in inland rivers across the country. 8,523 kilometers of new navigation marks have been established on existing navigable waterways for ships, of which 6,607 kilometers have night navigation equipment. At present, navigation management agencies have been established in three rivers, namely the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and the Heilongjiang River, and in twelve provinces. Through continuous training and cultivation, the number of waterway workers has grown to nearly 10,000.

    The waterway conditions of the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and the Heilongjiang River have been greatly improved in recent years. Night navigation signs have been set up on the Sichuan River waterway, which has rapid currents and many dangerous shoals, and key整治 (rectification/improvement) projects have been carried out. The situation of "the Sichuan River being a natural barrier" where night navigation was impossible no longer exists. At present, a round trip from Yichang to Chongqing on the Yangtze River has been shortened from seven days to five days. In the past, large liners and deep-draft vessels in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River often could not pass due to shallow water during the dry season. After setting up signs and dredging shoals, it has been basically guaranteed that fully loaded ships can safely navigate day and night throughout the year. On the Heilongjiang border river and the Songhua River, all the damaged signs were restored within a year after liberation, and now electrified navigation signs have been installed. The navigation conditions of the Xijiang River in the Pearl River system have also been greatly improved after整治 (rectification/improvement).

    Inland waterway work in various provinces has also been greatly developed. At present, 108 general survey teams are conducting the second inland river survey. The work of opening up small rivers has begun. Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces have set up new-style navigation marks. The dangerous shoals of the Minjiang River in Fujian and the Yuanjiang River in Hunan have been initially整治 (rectified/improved) and can now be navigable all year round. Other provinces are also carrying out dredging of shoals, clearing stones, and blasting reefs to further improve waterway conditions and reduce navigation difficulties.

### 全国内河航道新辟五千多公里

    全国内河航道新辟五千多公里
    新华社28日讯　全国内河几年来共开辟了五七二零公里的新航道；在现有的通轮船航道上建立了八五二三公里的新航标，其中六六零七公里有夜航设备。现在，已有长江、珠江、黑龙江等三条江和十二个省设立了航道管理机构。经过不断的训练与培养，航道工作人员已经发展到将近一万人。
    长江、珠江、黑龙江的航道条件，几年来已经得到了很大的改善。在水流湍急滩险多的川江航道上设置了夜航标志，并且重点地进行了整治工程。过去所谓“川江天险”不能夜航的情况已经不存在了。目前，长江自宜昌至重庆往返一个航次已由七天缩短为五天；长江中下游过去在枯水季节，大班轮和吃水较深船舶常因水浅无法通航，经设标和疏浚浅滩后，基本上已能保证满载的轮船全年昼夜安全通航。黑龙江国境河流及松花江，在解放后的一年中就把被破坏的标志全部恢复起来，现在并装置了电气化的导航标志。珠江水系的西江经整治后航行条件也大有改善。
    各省内河航道工作也有很大开展。现在全国已有一零八个普查队进行第二次内河调查。小河开辟工作已经开始进行，湖南、湖北、江西、福建等省都设置了新式航标。福建闽江、湖南沅江滩险经过初步整治已能长年通航。其他各省对滩险的疏浚、清石炸礁工作也正在开展，以便进一步改善航道条件，减少航行困难。
