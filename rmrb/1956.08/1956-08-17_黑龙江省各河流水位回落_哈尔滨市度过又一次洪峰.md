    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: Water levels in the Nenjiang, Mudanjiang, and Lalin Rivers in Heilongjiang Province continued to fall today. According to a report from the Dalai Hydrological Station, the Nenjiang River's water level at 8:00 AM today was four centimeters lower than at the same time yesterday, but still eight centimeters above the guaranteed water level. The water levels of the Mudanjiang and Lalin Rivers have both fallen below the warning level.
    The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters today issued instructions by telephone to cities and counties along the rivers, requiring them not to become complacent. Before the floodwaters recede below the warning level, they must continue to mobilize manpower and materials to strengthen dyke protection and prevent risks. Flood control personnel must not leave the dykes until the final victory is won.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: The water level of the second flood peak of the Songhua River has begun to recede. The highest water level of the flood peak in the Harbin area reached 120.06 meters. By 5:00 PM today, it had slowly receded to 120 meters.
    When the flood peak passed through the Harbin area, several instances of seepage, sloughing, and subsidence occurred along the city's river embankments. However, thanks to the timely rescue efforts of the city's people and the People's Liberation Army, no breaches or overflows occurred. The floodwaters were consistently blocked outside the city's main dykes, and the vast majority of factories continued production while simultaneously engaging in flood prevention, and shops remained open as usual.
    Currently, Harbin is still under the threat of floodwaters that are more than three meters above ground level. The twenty-six kilometers of dykes surrounding Harbin, after being raised and widened by nearly one million people over the past ten days, are generally one meter and fifty centimeters above the current water level. The second flood control dyke protecting the urban area, which began to be repaired on the 14th, was completed at 5:00 PM today.

    黑龙江省各河流水位回落
    哈尔滨市度过又一次洪峰
    据新华社哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省嫩江、牡丹江、拉林河等江河水位今天继续下降。据大赉水文站的报告，今天早晨八时嫩江水位比昨天同一时间下降了四公分，比保证水位尚高八公分。牡丹江和拉林河水位都降到了警戒水位以下。
    省防汛指挥部今天通过电话向沿江各市县发出指示，要求各市县不要麻痹松劲，在洪水在未降到警戒水位以下以前，要继续动员人力物力，加强护堤防险，在未得到最后胜利时，防汛人员不得离开堤坝。
    据新华社哈尔滨16日电　松花江第二次洪峰水位开始回落。洪峰的最高水位在哈尔滨地区曾达到120.06公尺，到今天下午五时，已缓缓回落到120公尺。
    在洪峰经过哈尔滨地区时，市区沿江堤坝曾发生好几处渗水、脱坡、沉陷等险象。但在全市人民和人民解放军的及时抢救下，没有发生决口和漫堤。洪水始终被挡在市区大堤之外，绝大多数工厂边防汛边生产，商店也营业如常。
    目前哈尔滨市仍处在高出地面三公尺以上的洪水威胁之下。环绕哈尔滨市的二十六公里的堤坝，经过十多天来近百万人工的加高和加宽，一般堤坝都高出目前水面一公尺五十公分。从十四日开始抢修的保卫市区的第二道防汛堤坝，已在今天下午五时完工。
