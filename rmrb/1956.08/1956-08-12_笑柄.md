    Laughingstock
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Our government recently approved visits to China by eighteen American journalists, but the U.S. State Department hurriedly dropped an iron curtain in front of these journalists, forbidding them from going to China. This action by the U.S. State Department has become a laughingstock for journalists around the world. When Soviet journalists discussed this matter with me, they all found it extremely amusing. I think this can truly be "compared" to the incident of not allowing Soviet chefs to enter the country. If not allowing Soviet chefs to enter the country was out of fear that the American people would come into contact with the Soviets, and that the truth about life in socialist Soviet Union would leak into the United States; then, not allowing their own journalists to come to China cannot but be out of fear that they would come into contact with the Chinese people, and that the truth about life in the new China would leak into the United States. Dulles, who is accustomed to boasting about the American way of life while slandering the new China, now dares not let his own journalists take a look at China, his timidity and guilt being extremely obvious.
    On August 10, both "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published articles discussing this matter.
    "Pravda" published an article by Vishnevsky entitled "Dulles Closes the Door to China," saying that life played a malicious joke on American journalists. Only a few weeks ago, they were vehemently denying the American "iron curtain" of "Communist propaganda," saying that it was actually socialist countries, not Washington, that opposed the exchange of delegations and individuals. But today, a chorus of protests comes from across the ocean. It seems these journalists have discovered that the United States has an "iron curtain" and are very angry about it. The State Department's "decree" makes the United States appear as a foolish, frightened country. American policymakers still want to pretend they know nothing about the "Geneva spirit." They pretend not to hear the protests raised by the American public. The American press wants to appeal to Washington's "reason," but in vain. Dulles' State Department is busy patching up the holes in its "iron curtain," completely forgetting that the whole world finds its strange work very laughable.
    Rogov wrote in "Izvestia": The U.S. State Department hurriedly prohibited American journalists from visiting China, using the excuse of "America's highest interests" to refuse to issue passports. We don't know if this is an iron curtain or a bamboo curtain, only that it was abruptly dropped by Secretary of State Dulles' agency. The "New York Times" correspondent in Washington reported that American officials seem to believe that it is impossible to "risk" allowing journalists to go to China. Rogov sarcastically said: The U.S. State Department certainly doesn't want to "risk" anything, but only in the sense that it fears that the American people will learn even a little about the People's Republic of China, about the Chinese people's peaceful construction, and about the despair and bankruptcy of the U.S. ruling clique's continued policy of non-recognition and blockade of great China.

    笑柄
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    我国政府最近批准了十八个美国记者到中国访问，而美国国务院赶紧在这些记者面前哗啦一下放下了铁幕，不许他们到中国。美国国务院的这个举动，已经成为世界新闻工作者的笑柄。苏联新闻工作者和我谈起这件事时候，大家都觉得十分好笑。我想，这真可以和不让苏联厨师入境那件事相“媲美”了。如果说不让苏联厨师入境，是怕美国人民跟苏联人接触，怕社会主义苏联的生活真相漏进美国去；那么，不让自己的记者到中国来，不能不是怕他们跟中国人民接触，怕新中国的生活真相漏进美国去。惯于吹嘘美国式的生活而诬蔑新中国的杜勒斯，现在却不敢让他自己的记者到中国看看，其胆怯和心虚十分明显。
    八月十日，“真理报”和“消息报”都发表了谈论这件事的文章。
    “真理报”发表维什涅夫斯基以“杜勒斯关上到中国去的门”为题的文章说，生活对美国记者开了一个恶意的玩笑。仅仅几个星期以前，他们还慷慨激昂地否认“共产党宣传”的美国“铁幕”，他们说实际上反对交换代表团和个人的是社会主义国家而不是华盛顿。而今天，又从大洋彼岸传来了一片抗议声。看来这些记者们发现了美国有“铁幕”，对此感到非常气愤。国务院的“法令”使美国表现为一个愚蠢的吓坏了的国家。美国的决策者们仍旧想假装对“日内瓦精神”一无所知。他们对美国公众提出的抗议假装不闻不见。美国报界想诉诸华盛顿的“理智”也是徒然。杜勒斯的国务院正忙着缝补它的“铁幕”上的破洞，而完全忘记了全世界觉得它这种奇异的工作很是可笑。
    罗果夫在“消息报”上写道：美国国务院匆忙地禁止美国记者访问中国。借口“美国的最高利益”而拒绝发给护照。我们不知道这是铁幕还是竹幕，只知道它是由杜勒斯国务卿的主管机关断然放下的。“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者报道说，美国官方认为似乎不能“冒险”让记者们去中国。罗果夫讥笑说：美国国务院确实不愿“冒险”，但只是在如下含义上，就是它怕美国国内知道了甚至一点儿关于中华人民共和国、关于中国人民进行和平建设、关于美国统治集团继续进行的不承认和封锁伟大中国的政策的绝望而破产的真相。
