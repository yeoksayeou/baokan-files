    Meetings Flooding into Disaster
    To the Editor:
    Recently, state-owned commercial departments in Heilongjiang Province have been working to solve problems in the welfare of employees, such as employee housing, working hours, canteens, and nurseries, according to the spirit of the central government's instructions. However, the problem of too many and too long meetings, which seriously affects employees' rest, has not received due attention.
    Employees of a store in the Nangang District Trading Branch Company No. 1 in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, have to attend meetings every night. Monday night is the trade union activity day, conducting competition inspection and evaluation work; Tuesday night is for Party classes, and non-Party employees are called to meetings to discuss and study work; Wednesday night is Party and League life meetings, and League life meetings must absorb young people, because there are few older people, they are all included; Thursday night is theoretical study, and employees who do not study theory have to attend meetings to examine their work; Friday night is business and current affairs study. Saturday night should be for employees to rest, right? Not so. This night is often occupied by meetings that could not be squeezed in during the week. Because the employees of this store get up at four o'clock every morning to participate in cultural studies, work all day, and attend meetings at night, they often cannot go to bed until after ten o'clock, and those who live far away cannot get home until after eleven o'clock. Female employees with children are even more miserable, those whose children are in the nursery have to take them back, and they have to feed the children at night. Needless to say, time for rest and cultural and sports activities, even sleep time is very short. Most sleep for six hours, and the least for less than five hours.
    In Bayan County Department Store, meetings are so frequent that they completely break the rules. Meetings are held without notice here, and notice is only given when there is no meeting. Employees reflect, "We rarely see notices of no meetings in our unit. If we are notified that there will be no meeting one night, we are simply overjoyed."
    At present, not only are there too many meetings in the grassroots units of the state-owned commercial system in Heilongjiang Province, but they also last a long time, especially the long reports by leading cadres are even more of a headache. They do not prepare beforehand, but speak wherever they think of it at the meeting, digressing and taking the opportunity to elaborate, it's simply endless. As a result, leaders speak with relish on the stage, and employees below fall asleep. Of course, to do work, we have to hold meetings. I am not opposed to all meetings. Meetings that should be held and must be held must be held, and they must be held well. But we must oppose the leadership style that regards holding meetings as the only method of work, holding meetings for everything, and every meeting must be "long," with no mass viewpoint at all.

### 泛滥成灾的会议

    泛滥成灾的会议编辑同志：
    最近黑龙江省国营商业部门正在按照中央指示精神着手解决职工生活福利工作上的问题，诸如：职工住宅、劳动时间、食堂、托儿所等等。可是会议多，会议长，严重影响职工休息的问题却没有引起应有的重视。
    黑龙江省哈尔滨市南岗区贸易支公司一商店的职工，每天晚上都要开会。星期一晚上是工会活动日，进行竞赛的检查评比工作；星期二晚上是上党课，非党职工要被召集起来开会讨论研究工作；星期三晚上是党团生活会，团的生活会要吸收青年参加，因为没有几个老年，也是一包在内；星期四晚上是理论学习，不学理论的职工要开会检查自己的工作；星期五晚上是业务、时事学习。星期六晚上该叫职工们休息了吧？不是这样，这一天晚上也常常被平时挤不开的会议所占用。这个商店的职工由于每天早晨四点钟就起床参加文化学习，白天干一天工作，晚上开会，经常都在十点钟以后才能睡觉，家离得远的十一点多钟才能回到家。有小孩的女职工就更苦，小孩放在哺乳室的得抱回去，晚上还得给孩子喂奶，不用说休息和文化体育活动的时间，就是睡眠的时间都是很短的。最多的睡六个钟头，最少的还不足五个钟头。
    巴彦县百货公司会议多到完全打破了常规，这里开会是不发通知的，不开会时才通知，职工反映说：“我们单位很少看到不开会的通知，若是通知哪个晚上不开会，简直把我们乐坏了”。
    目前黑龙江省国营商业系统基层单位不但是会议多，而且一开起来时间就很长，特别是领导干部的大报告更使人头痛，事前不作准备，到会上想到哪讲到哪，东扯西拉，借题发挥，简直没完没了。结果形成领导者在台上讲得津津有味，职工在下边听得昏昏欲睡。当然，做工作，总得开会。我并不是反对一切的会议，应该开、必需开的会一定要开，而且还要开好。但是一定要反对那种把开会当做唯一的工作方法，不管什么事都开会，而且每会必“长”，毫无群众观点的领导作风。
