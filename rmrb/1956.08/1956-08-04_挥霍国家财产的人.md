    Squanderers of State Property
    Editor:
    Wang Bingchu of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, when transferred from the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission to the Xiang-E-Gan Flood Storage and Reclamation Commission as Director of the Office in December 1954, took all the furniture allocated to him by the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission. However, this still couldn't satisfy the director's demands. After taking office, his first act was to personally go to the market to purchase furniture. Consequently, Western-style glass cabinets, spring beds, mahogany square tables, etc., were all acquired. But this still wasn't enough, because there were no sanitary facilities in the house, so Guangzhou ceramic toilet bowls, Tangshan ceramic washbasins, bathtubs, etc., also appeared in the director's residence. While in Hunan, he saw that the ivory seals there were nice, so he spent public money to have a seal engraved with characters on all four sides (requiring a magnifying glass to see them clearly). To avoid criticism, he bought a dressing table for each section chief. Then, he spent more than 14,000 yuan to build a bathhouse. When building the bathhouse, someone said that the bathhouse wasn't needed urgently and that a kitchen should be built first. He said, "Whoever disagrees doesn't have to take a bath!" This director, in less than half a year in office, squandered a lot of money, of which nearly 2,000 yuan was spent on purchasing furniture and installing sanitary equipment for himself. Moreover, Director Wang even sought reimbursement from the public funds for the candy expenses for his wedding. People might say that Director Wang probably doesn't understand financial regulations. No! He does understand them. He even served as the chief of the finance department at the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission for two years!
    This director also often loses his temper and likes to reprimand people. Once, a purchasing agent from the office, Comrade Yu Wenlie, took a jeep to buy candy for the New Year festival. He returned late and was not given a ride to the theater, so he flew into a rage. The comrades in the secretariat hastily hired a pedicab for him. After watching the show past eleven o'clock, the secretariat sent a car to pick him up. Upon his return, he berated the driver and then woke Yu Wenlie from his sleep and scolded him for half an hour. Yu Wenlie, seeing that he seemed less angry, wanted to sit on the director's sofa for a while. Unexpectedly, Director Wang slammed the table and shouted, "Who told you to sit down? Stand up immediately!" Poor Yu Wenlie had to stand up immediately and say "Yes, yes, yes!" From then on, he never dared to see Director Wang again. Zhang Kechang, the head of the secretariat, was also frequently subjected to such reprimands. Because Director Wang was so arrogant and had such a rude style, the comrades were very afraid of him. The section chiefs didn't want to see him, and the cooks didn't dare to deliver food to him.
    When the Central South Greater Administrative Region was abolished, it was clearly stipulated that the Xiang-E-Gan Flood Storage and Reclamation Commission should be managed by the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, but Director Wang refused to obey the leadership. When the finance section of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission wanted to understand why they were using large trucks, Director Wang said, "Ignore them!" When the secretariat and personnel section sent quarterly and annual reports to the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, Director Wang also prevented them from sending them. During the Spring Festival, when members of the Communist Youth League went to the CYL committee of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission for a meeting, Director Wang said, "Don't forget that you are people of the Flood Storage Commission. Those who eat the Flood Storage Commission's food must attend the Flood Storage Commission's meetings."
    After the masses reported him, the Party General Branch of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission organized an investigation and submitted a report with proposed disciplinary actions to the Party Committee of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission. But this report was like a stone sinking into the sea. The Supervision Office of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission believed that he should not only be subject to Party disciplinary action but also administrative disciplinary action. Therefore, they wrote a report and sought the opinions of the Party Committee, but this report was also suppressed. What is the reason for this? It is hoped that the Party Committee of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission will conduct a serious investigation.

### 挥霍国家财产的人

    挥霍国家财产的人编辑同志：
    长江水利委员会的王炳初，1954年12月由长江水利委员会调到湘鄂赣蓄洪垦殖委员会任办公室主任时，就把长江水利委员会配备给他的家具全部带走。但是，这仍不能满足这位主任的要求，在他上任之后，第一件事是亲自上市场去购买家具，因此西式玻璃柜、弹簧床、红木方桌等，应有尽有。但是这仍不行，因为屋内没有卫生设备，于是广州磁座马桶、唐山磁面盆、洗澡盆等也出现在这位主任的宿舍里了。去湖南，他看到那里的象牙图章不错，于是他就花公家钱刻了一个四面有字（要用放大镜才能看清）的图章。为了怕人提意见，他就给每一位科长买了一个梳妆台。接着又花了一万四千多元修了一个浴池。修浴池时，曾有人说浴池暂时用不着，应该先修个厨房，他说：“谁不同意谁就不用洗澡！”这位主任到任不到半年，就挥霍浪费了很多钱，而其中为自己购置家具、安装卫生设备的就将近二千元。不仅如此，王主任结婚时的糖果费也要向公家报销。人们会说王主任大概不懂财经制度吧，不！他是懂得的，他还在长江水利委员会当了两年的财务处长哩！
    这位主任还经常发脾气，好训斥人。有次机关采购员俞文烈同志坐了吉普车去买年节的糖果，回来晚了，没有用汽车送他去看戏，他就大发雷霆，秘书科的同志急忙给他雇了辆三轮车，十一点多钟他看完戏，秘书科又派汽车把他接回来。回来之后，他训够了司机，又把俞文烈从梦中叫醒，训了半个钟头，俞文烈见他好像消了点气，就想在主任的沙发上坐一会儿，谁知王主任将桌子一拍，大喝一声说：“那个叫你坐下的，赶快站起来！”可怜的俞文烈只得马上站起来，口里还得说“是，是，是！”从此他再也不敢见王主任了，秘书科的负责人张克昌同志也经常受到这样的训斥。由于王主任这样盛气凌人，作风粗暴，所以同志们都很怕他，科长们不愿见他，炊事员不敢给他去送饭。
    在中南大区撤销时，曾明令规定湘鄂赣蓄洪垦殖委员会由长江水利委员会代管，可是王主任却不服从领导。长江水利委员会财务科要了解他们为什么要用大卡车，王主任说：“别理他！”秘书科、人事科向长江水利委员会送季报、年报表时，王主任也阻止不叫送。春节时团员们到长江水利委员会团委开会，王主任说：“别忘了你们是蓄委会的人，吃蓄委会的饭就要开蓄委会的会”
    在群众告发了他之后，长江水利委员会党总支曾组织过检查，也提出过处理意见报告长江水利委员会党委会。可是这个报告如同石沉大海。长江水利委员会监察室认为他不但要受党纪处分，而且应该受到行政纪律处分，因此就写了报告并征求党委意见，可是这个报告又被压下去了。这究竟是为了什么？希望长江水利委员会党委会认真检查一下。　子·羊
