Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 1st - The survey of hydropower resources in the Honghe River, Yunnan Province, was basically completed in late July. Existing data indicate that the main stream and tributaries of the Honghe River have a potential generating capacity of over 1.5 million kilowatts, making it the river with the most abundant hydropower resources in southern Yunnan.

The survey of the Honghe River began in June last year. Over the past year, the survey personnel have traveled throughout the Honghe River basin. They have found that the Honghe River's hydropower resources have many conditions that facilitate development: the dozen or so tributaries of the Honghe River that originate in the Ailao Mountains have drops of over 1,000 meters, making it possible to build high-head power stations with low investment and construction costs; the geographical conditions in the upper and middle reaches of the Honghe River are very suitable for building multi-year regulating reservoirs, so that the power generation capacity in dry years can be as abundant as in normal years; the banks of the Honghe River are mostly sandstone and phyllite, which are suitable for hydraulic engineering construction; the hydropower resources of the Honghe River are close to industrial and mining areas such as Gejiu, and do not require very long transmission equipment.

    红河水力资源丰富
    新华社昆明1日电　云南省红河水力资源的普查工作，在七月下旬基本结束。已经有的资料说明，红河的干流和支流蕴藏的发电能力在一百五十万瓩以上，是目前云南南部水力资源最丰富的一条河流。
    红河的普查工作是从去年六月开始的。一年以来，普查人员走遍了红河流域，他们发现红河的水力资源有许多便于开发的条件：红河南岸发源于哀牢山脉的十几条支流，都有一千公尺以上的落差，可以建立投资少、造价低的高水头电站；红河上、中游的地理条件，很适宜建立多年性的调节水库，使枯水年的发电能力也能同常年一样充沛；红河两岸大多是砂岩和千牧岩，这种岩石适宜于水工建筑；红河水力资源离个旧等工矿区近，不需要很长的输电设备。
