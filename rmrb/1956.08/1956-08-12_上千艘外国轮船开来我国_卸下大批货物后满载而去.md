Xinhua News Agency, August 11th—To date, over a thousand foreign ships have arrived in China this year. These ships have transported millions of tons of metal materials, complete sets of machinery, as well as fertilizers, rubber, and other materials. Simultaneously, thousands of foreign ships departing from China have carried millions of tons of Chinese-produced mineral ores, coal, salt, leather, medicinal materials, soybeans, tung oil, and other goods.

In recent years, the number of countries trading with China has increased year by year, and the number of foreign ships arriving in China has also increased year by year. This year, ships arriving in China come from over twenty countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Pakistan, Norway, Japan, Burma, the Netherlands, East Germany, France, Denmark, Turkey, India, Yugoslavia, the Union of South Africa, Italy, and North Korea. Some countries have established trade relations with China, while others have not. Some are regular liners, while others are specialized ships transporting entire shipments of goods. These ships have brought many materials urgently needed for China's economic construction and have returned fully loaded from Chinese ports, playing a certain role in China's foreign trade. The volume of goods imported and exported through Chinese ports last year increased threefold compared to 1953, and it is expected to reach more than fourfold this year.

These foreign ships are very welcome among the Chinese people. Foreign ships can freely travel to and from China's six major ports of Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, as well as the ports of Hainan Island, Fuzhou, Lianyungang, Yantai, and Yingkou. The Chinese Seamen's Union has established clubs in various ports to entertain foreign sailors and has also set up service departments to help foreign sailors purchase their favorite Chinese silk, carvings, and other specialties. Foreign sailors who come to China are very interested in the scenery of New China and the inexpensive and high-quality local products, and they unanimously praise the good order of Chinese ports.

Xinhua News Agency, August 10th—A relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Trade told reporters today that China has imported a large amount of construction materials from abroad in the first half of this year. The total value of imports arriving in the first half of this year increased by 20.52% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the import volume of complete sets of factory equipment, tractors, fertilizers, insecticides, mining drilling machines, and some important industrial raw materials increased the most.

The complete sets of equipment that have arrived in the first half of this year increased by approximately 36.95% compared to the same period last year. Imports of tractors more than doubled compared to the same period last year, fertilizers more than doubled, drilling machines increased by 76%, insecticides more than tripled, and rubber increased more than fivefold. Other major industrial raw materials such as copper wire, jute, wool, and wool tops have all increased to varying degrees compared to last year.

    上千艘外国轮船开来我国
    卸下大批货物后满载而去
    新华社11日讯　到现在为止，今年已经有上千艘外国轮船开来中国。这些轮船运来了成百万吨的五金器材，成套的机器设备，以及肥田粉、橡胶等物资。同时从中国开出的千艘外轮运出了几百万吨中国出产的矿砂、煤、盐、皮革、药材、大豆、桐油等。
    近几年来，和中国进行贸易的国家一年比一年增多，开来中国的外国轮船也一年比一年增加。今年开来中国的，有苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、英国、瑞典、芬兰、巴基斯坦、挪威、日本、缅甸、荷兰、民主德国、法国、丹麦、土耳其、印度、南斯拉夫、南非联邦、意大利、朝鲜等二十几个国家的轮船。有些国家已经和中国订立了贸易关系，有的还没有订立贸易关系，有些是定期班轮，有些是运送整船货物的专轮。这些船只带来了许多中国经济建设所急需的物资，又从中国港口满载而归，对于中国对外贸易起了一定的作用。去年从中国各港口进出口的物资已经比1953年增加了三倍，预计今年可以达到四倍以上。
    这些外国轮船，很受中国人民欢迎。外国轮船在中国著名的广州、上海、大连、天津、青岛、秦皇岛六大港，和海南岛、福州、连云港、烟台、营口等港，都可以自由往来。中国的海员工会在各港设有俱乐部招待外国海员，还设有服务部帮助外国海员购买他们喜爱的中国丝绸、雕刻品等特产。来到中国的外国海员们，对于新中国的风光和价廉物美的特产很感兴趣，并且一致赞扬中国港口秩序良好。
    新华社10日讯　对外贸易部有关负责人今天对记者说，今年上半年我国又从国外进口了大量建设物资。今年上半年进口到货的总额，比去年同期增长20.52％。其中进口量增长最多的是工厂成套设备、拖拉机、肥田粉、杀虫药剂、采矿用的钻探机和一些重要的工业原料。
    今年上半年已经到货的成套设备，比去年同期约增加36.95％，进口的拖拉机比去年同期增加两倍以上，肥田粉增加了一倍以上，钻探机增加了76％，杀虫药剂增加了三倍以上，橡胶增加了五倍以上。其他主要的工业原料如紫铜丝、黄麻、羊毛及毛条等，都比去年有不同程度的增加。
