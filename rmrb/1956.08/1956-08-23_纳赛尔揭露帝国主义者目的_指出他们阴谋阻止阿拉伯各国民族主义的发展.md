    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 22nd: Egyptian President Nasser, in an interview with a reporter from the Syrian newspaper "Al-Jiran," said that those who are attempting to infringe upon Egypt's legitimate rights are not only trying to undermine Egypt's sovereignty, but their aim is to stop the development of nationalism in Arab countries, because these people feel that this is a threat to their material interests and imperialist aims.
    Nasser said, "Every Egyptian now feels that he is not alone; beside him are millions of Arabs, a powerful force of struggle and sacrifice, whose advance cannot be stopped by anyone."
    He also said that the Arabs are determined to achieve their goals and develop their resources to live.
    Egyptian newspapers on August 21st reprinted this interview.
