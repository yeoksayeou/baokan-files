Actively Promote Scientific and Technological Knowledge to Workers

Learning the Science and Technology of Navigation

Qingdao Port suffers many shipping production and maritime damage accidents. The main reason is the low level of culture and technology among the crew. Generally, captains navigate by "looking at the mountains," and do not use technical operations such as "finding the ship's position," "light signals," and "signals." Therefore, the crew's desire to learn technology is very urgent. The Shandong Regional Committee of the China Seamen's Union and the Qingdao Seamen's Club, in conjunction with the Qingdao Port Supervision Bureau, invited the Municipal Science and Technology Popularization Association to hold a series of lectures on navigation science and technology starting in August 1954.

Through learning, the crew's knowledge of navigation science and technology has been improved, adapting to the needs of production development. For example, lectures on topics such as compass error conversion, finding ship positions, and how to use nautical charts have improved the crew's theoretical knowledge of navigation, accelerated ship turnover rates, reduced maritime damage accidents, and ensured safe navigation.

Lectures on the structure of internal combustion engines, DC motors and water pumps, and the principles of crankshaft fracture have improved the crew's understanding of internal combustion engine principles, further understanding of machine efficiency, and strengthened machine maintenance.

Scientific and technological lectures on typhoons, tidal movements, planets, fog, and snow have enriched the crew's natural science knowledge and overcome some superstitious, conservative, and backward ideas among the crew. Some crew members said, "Through the lectures, we learned that typhoons are not caused by the 'Wind Goddess' and that rising and falling tides are not caused by the 'Sea Dragon King.'" They understood that even in calm seas, fishing nets can still be rolled up due to underwater currents. The crew studied the problem of net rolling, improved the "drawstring" distance of the fishing nets, shortening it, reducing accidents, and increasing the number of fishing hauls.

Through learning, the crew's enthusiasm for learning scientific and technological knowledge has been enhanced, and many crew members have incorporated scientific and technological learning into their own study plans.

Lectures in the Cotton Mill

The regular activities of the Nanjing Cotton Mill's trade union club were limited to borrowing a few books and organizing weekend dances. It had never held any science knowledge lectures. Later, the trade union felt that this situation should be changed. After obtaining the support of the Party Committee and the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association, it organized two science and hygiene knowledge lectures in late April, attracting nearly 300 people and receiving a warm welcome from the masses.

The trade union absorbed technicians and cultural instructors who were more enthusiastic about social work to participate in the lectures.

In terms of lecture content, the primary consideration was to cater to the needs of the masses and to be able to address existing problems in production technology. The main problem in our current production is quality, which is closely related to how well impurity removal and sliver preparation work are done. Therefore, we decided to hold lectures on impurity removal and sliver preparation, as well as lectures on temperature and humidity issues related to quality. There are many female workers in our factory. The trade union also organized lectures targeting the illnesses of female workers, and also organized lectures on exercise and health. These contents basically meet the needs of the masses.

Through learning, the workers' enthusiasm for learning scientific knowledge has been greatly improved, and their work and technology have also improved.

Learning Technology in Conjunction with Production

The Guangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace's promotion of production technology and scientific knowledge began in 1954. By 1955, it was holding four or five lectures per month, and this February it had increased to fourteen lectures per month. These included technical lectures such as accelerated blueprint reading for mechanical workers and the basic principles of crane operators. The Cultural Palace has also held lectures on labor protection knowledge, such as the importance of factory safety and hygiene, how to reduce high temperatures in workshops, prevent industrial dust from entering the lungs, and first aid for work-related injuries. It has also held scientific knowledge lectures such as what is the universe, the structure of the Earth, and flying to the moon. The Cultural Palace also held lectures on women's health knowledge specifically for female workers.

After studying, the workers improved their theoretical level. Old worker Zhou Wen said, "I have been working for decades, and I only know how to do it. When apprentices ask me to explain the principles, I can't answer. After studying, I finally understand."

After the Cultural Palace held lectures on accelerated blueprint reading for mechanical workers, the general performance of the workers was very good, with 88% achieving good or excellent results. Some workers can construct according to blueprints after learning.

Through popular lectures on atomic energy, everyone clearly understood the two paths to utilizing atomic energy, thereby further deepening their love for the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and their hatred for the American aggressive bloc. (Guangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace)

### 积极向职工宣传科学技术知识

    积极向职工宣传科学技术知识
    学习航海的科学技术
    青岛港航运生产海损事故多，主要原因是：船员文化技术水平低。一般船长是看“山头航行”，不会使用“找船位”、“灯语”、“信号”等技术操作。因此，船员要求学习技术的心情非常迫切。中国海员工会山东区委员会青岛海员俱乐部会同青岛港务监督邀请市科学技术普及协会，在1954年8月开始举办航海科学技术讲座。
    通过学习，提高了船员的航海科学技术知识，适应了生产发展的需要。如通过罗镜差错换算、找船位、怎样使用海图等内容的讲座，提高了船员航海理论知识，加速了船只周转率，减少了海损事故，保证了航行安全。
    通过了内燃机构造、直流电机和水泵、大轴折断的道理等内容的讲座，提高了船员对内燃机原理的理解，进一步了解了机器效能，加强了机器勤修保养工作。
    台风、潮汐运动、星球、雾、雪等科学技术讲座，丰富了船员的自然科学知识，克服了船员中某些迷信、保守落后思想。有的船员说，“通过讲座，才知道起台风不是由于风婆婆作怪，涨、落潮不是因为海龙王闹海”。他们懂得了在风平浪静的时候，渔网下海还会卷起，是由于海底潮流的关系。船员们对卷网事情进行了研究，改进了渔网的“抽脚线”距离，由长改短，减少了事故，增加了捞鱼的网次。
    通过学习，提高了船员学习科学技术知识的热情，许多船员把科学技术学习订入自己学习规划中去。

    纱厂里开讲座
    南京纱厂工会俱乐部的经常活动，只限于借阅几本图书和组织周末舞会，从来没有举办过什么科学知识讲座。后来工会觉得应改变这种情况，在取得了党委的支持和江苏省科学技术普及协会的帮助以后，在四月下旬组织了两次科学和卫生知识讲座，吸引了将近三百多人参加，受到了群众的欢迎。
    工会吸收了对社会工作比较热心的技术员、文化教员参加讲演。
    在讲演内容方面，首先考虑到要能够切合群众的需要，能够同解决生产技术上存在的问题结合起来。我们当前生产上主要是质量问题，而质量又同除杂和条杆工作做得好坏有很大关系，因此确定了举办除杂和条杆的讲座，并且举办同质量有关的温湿度问题讲座。我们厂里的女工很多。工会又针对女工的患病情况，组织了讲座，另外还组织了锻炼与健康的讲座。这些内容基本上是符合群众需要的。
    通过学习，大大提高了职工对科学知识学习的热情，工作和技术也有所提高。

    结合生产学技术
    广州市工人文化宫的生产技术和科学知识的宣传，是从1954年开始的，到1955年每月举行四、五次讲座，今年二月已经增加到每月举行十四次。其中有机械工人速成看图、起重工基本原理等技术讲座。文化宫还举办过劳动保护知识讲座，如工厂安全卫生重要性、如何降低车间高温、防止工业尘埃侵入肺部、工伤急救等，还举办了宇宙是什么、地球的构造、飞向月球等科学知识讲座。文化宫还专为女工举办了妇女卫生知识的讲座等。
    经过学习后，工人们提高了理论水平。老工人周文说：“我干了几十年工作，只懂得如何做，学徒要我解释原理，我就没办法回答，经过学习才知道了。”
    文化宫举办过机械工人速成看图的讲座后，工人一般成绩都很好，成绩优良的占88％。有的工人学习后，能按图施工。
    通过原子能通俗讲座，大家清楚了利用原子能的两条道路，从而进一步加深对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的热爱，和对美国侵略集团的憎恨。　（广州市工人文化宫）（附图片）
