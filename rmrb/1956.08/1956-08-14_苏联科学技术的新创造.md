New Scientific and Technological Creations of the Soviet Union

    Ear-Insertable Radio
    Soviet engineer Kurlyanovich has created a portable radio so small it can be placed in the ear. It weighs only 300 grams in total.
    Its tiny box contains not only a radio receiver with a transmitter but also a miniature amplifier and a button-sized telephone. Its bulb can be used for both receiving and transmitting. These advantages are due to the use of semiconductors instead of amplifier tubes.
    This small radio is very easy to use. If you want to use the transmitter instead of the receiver, just flip a switch. The price of this radio is very low, with the cost of all parts being only about 100 rubles.
    The effective range of this radio is two kilometers. It is now mainly used by sports coaches and athletes. It is a necessary tool for skaters, skiers, cyclists, and track and field athletes during training. Parachutists can use it to receive long-distance guidance from coaches and accurately calculate landing points. This radio is also suitable for mountaineers and geologists. It is very convenient for car dispatchers to maintain contact with taxi drivers using it.
    This radio can not only be used for two-way communication but also for recording within a one-kilometer radius.
    In addition, this engineer has also created a pocket-sized ultra-shortwave radio weighing 400 grams. He is currently creating a semiconductor radio.

    Method of Grafting Dentures into the Jawbone
    According to the "Moscow Truth" on the 12th, Soviet medical scientists have created a unique method of grafting dentures into a person's jawbone. This method has been tested many times with good results, and the dentures are very firmly attached to the person's jawbone.
    The method is as follows: After a diseased tooth is extracted and the bleeding is stopped, a denture made of special plastic, identical in shape, size, and color to the original tooth, is placed in its original position. Its root has channels leading in all directions. When the denture is first installed, it is clamped tightly with specially made small aluminum splints. After three or four weeks, a strong connective tissue capsule forms around the root of the tooth, and solid muscle tissue penetrates the channels in the root, firmly fixing the denture in place. After a few months, X-ray photographs show that not only muscle has grown in the root area but also ossification is taking place.
    This method was created by Professor Yeliseyev of the First Moscow Medical College and young graduate student Vares after much exploration. The Scientific Committee of the Soviet Ministry of Health believes that this method can be recommended for use in dental clinics. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联科学技术的新创造
    可以放在耳朵里的无线电台
    苏联工程师库尔里雅诺维奇创制了一种小得可以放在耳朵里的携带式无线电台。它的重量总共只有三百公分。
    它的一个小小的盒子里不仅装有带有发讯机的收音机，而且还装有小巧玲珑的扩音器和小得像扣子那样的电话机。它的灯泡可以用来收音和发话。这种电台之所以具有这些优点，是由于利用半导体代替了放大管。
    这种小型的无线电台使用起来非常简单。如果不使用它的收音机而要使用它的发话机，只要扭一下开关就行了。这种电台的价格是很低廉的，全部零件的成本只有约一百卢布。
    这种无线电台的有效距离为两公里。现在它主要是供体育教练员和运动员用。它是滑冰、滑雪、自行车和田径运动员在锻炼的时候很必需的工具。跳伞运动员可以用它来接受教练员的远距离指导和准确地计算出着陆的地点。这种无线电台还适用于爬山运动员和地质工作者。汽车调度员用它来同出租汽车司机保持联系是很方便的。
    这种电台不单是可以用来进行双边联系，而且还可以进行一公里范围以内的录音。
    此外，这位工程师还制造了一种袖珍超短波无线电台，它的重量是四百公分。现在，他还在创制半导体无线电台。
    使假牙长入牙床的方法
    据“莫斯科真理报”12日报道，苏联的医学家创造了一种独特的使假牙长入人的牙床的方法。这种方法经过多次试验，结果良好，假牙在人的牙床上长得很牢固。
    这种方法是：当一颗病牙被拔除止血以后，在它的原来位置上装上一颗用特殊塑料做成的假牙，它的形状、大小、颜色和原来的牙齿一模一样，它的根部有通向四面八方的孔道。假牙初装上去的时候，用特制的小铝夹板夹紧。经过三、四个星期之后，在牙根的周围便形成了有力的联结组织肌囊，在牙根的孔道中渗入了结实的筋肉，这种筋肉把假牙牢牢固定在位置上。几个月之后，经爱克斯光照片证明，牙根部不仅生长了肌肉，而且在进行骨化。
    这种方法是莫斯科第一医学院教授叶利谢耶夫和青年研究生瓦雷斯经过多次探索后创造出来的。苏联卫生部科学委员会认为这种方法可以推荐给口腔科使用。（新华社）
