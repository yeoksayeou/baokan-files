Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th. Another batch of goods was shipped from Shanghai Port to Egypt today.

    Since the British authorities froze Egyptian pound deposits on July 28th, trade between various foreign trade units in Shanghai and Egypt has continued as usual. Based on completed contracts, these units have successively shipped five batches of goods to Egypt, including textile machinery, film projectors, silk, and vegetable oil. The Shanghai Sundries and Native Produce State-owned Export Companies have also concluded nineteen new transactions with Egyptian merchants.

    Trade between Shanghai Port and Egypt has greatly developed this year. From January to August this year, goods shipped from here to Egypt have increased fifteenfold compared to the same period last year.

    上海口岸又运一批商品往埃及
    新华社上海29日电　上海口岸今天又运往埃及一批商品。
    自7月28日英国当局冻结了埃及的英镑存款以后，上海各个对外贸易单位同埃及的贸易照常进行，这些单位根据已成交的合同，已经先后向埃及运出五批货物，其中包括纺织机械、电影放映机、丝绸和植物油等；上海的杂品、土产等国营出口公司并和埃及商户成交了十九笔新的交易。
    上海口岸今年和埃及的贸易有很大的发展，今年1月到8月从这里运往埃及的商品比去年同期增加了十五倍。
