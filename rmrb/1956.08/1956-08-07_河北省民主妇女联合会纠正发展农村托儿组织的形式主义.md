Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 5th: The Hebei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation recently instructed various localities to universally rectify childcare mutual aid organizations in agricultural cooperatives, and to correct the formalistic tendencies that have occurred in cooperatives in the development of these organizations.

After the realization of cooperativization in Hebei Province, local Party committees, with the assistance of women's federations, extensively developed childcare mutual aid organizations based on the demands of the broad masses of rural women actively participating in field production. Thanks to the development of various childcare organizations, more than 410,000 mothers were able to participate in field production.

However, due to the blindness of leadership at all levels when establishing childcare mutual aid organizations, as well as the task-oriented thinking and formalistic ideology of some cadres, there was a tendency to organize all children under the age of seven, regardless of actual needs and the wishes of the mothers, and to force children into childcare centers and groups even if there were elderly people at home to look after them.

The Hebei Provincial Women's Federation conducted in-depth investigations into these issues. The results of the investigation proved that currently, the number of children needing care only accounts for 30% to 40% of the total number of children, while the remaining children can be taken care of by cooperative members themselves. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation instructed various localities that, when organizing childcare mutual aid organizations or resolving the issue of nanny compensation, they must adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and should not blindly develop them regardless of reality and feasibility. In terms of organizational form, small-scale and diverse forms are encouraged, such as mothers taking turns to look after children, mixed care of older and younger children, and so on. If cooperative members can solve the problem of children's burdens themselves, they should not be forced to hand their children over to nurseries or groups.

### 河北省民主妇女联合会纠正发展农村托儿组织的形式主义

    纠正发展农村托儿组织的形式主义
    据新华社保定5日电　河北省民主妇女联合会最近指示各地普遍整顿农业社的托儿互助组织，纠正合作社在发展这一组织中发生的形式主义的偏向。
    河北省在实现合作化以后，各地党委曾协助妇联组织根据广大农村妇女积极参加田间生产的要求，大量发展了托儿互助组织。由于各种托儿组织的发展，共使四十一万多母亲得以参加田间生产。
    但是，由于各级领导机关在建立托儿互助组织时存在着盲目性，以及某些干部有任务观点和形式主义思想，因而产生了不看实际需要与母亲们的要求如何，一律把七岁以下的孩子全部组织起来，家中有老人看管的也强制孩子入所入组。
    河北省妇联针对这些问题进行了深入的调查，调查结果证明，当前需要受托的孩子仅占孩子总数的30％到40％，其余的孩子，社员自己可以解决。因此，河北省妇联指示各地，在组织托儿互助组织或解决保姆的报酬问题时，必须本着自愿互利的原则，不应脱离实际和可能盲目地去发展。在组织形式上，提倡小型的多种多样的形式，如母亲轮流看管、大小孩子混合看管等等。社员能自己解决孩子牵累的，不应该强迫她们把孩子交给托儿所、组。
