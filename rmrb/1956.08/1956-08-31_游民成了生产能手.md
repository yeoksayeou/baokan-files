Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 24th: More than one thousand former vagrants in Shenyang City have become skilled workers in various production posts. At the Anping Quarry south of Shenyang City, there are now more than four hundred former vagrants quarrying building stone. They work eight hours a day and can produce more than five thousand cubic meters of building stone each month. In the first half of this year, they quarried more than 35,900 cubic meters of building stone for the state, exceeding the original plan by 37%.

More than one hundred and forty former vagrants are working in the tile-making workshop of the Jianxin Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Shenyang. They can manufacture various cement tiles, magnesite tiles, and cement pipes for the state. Zhang Shukuai and Kong Qingnian, who had wandered the streets and engaged in theft for many years, have now become first-class skilled workers. They are engaging in socialist labor emulation with the workers of the entire workshop, and were rated as a model workshop in the entire factory in July.

This group of vagrants, who were stained with various bad habits in the old society, have now received education and transformation through labor. They live in state-built dormitories and, after eight hours of work, can study culture and engage in legitimate recreational activities. Because the state implements a wage system of "to each according to his work," their living conditions have improved. Many have married, some have remarried their former wives, and they have re-established their families.

    游民成了生产能手
    新华社沈阳24日电　沈阳市有一千多名过去的游民成为各个生产岗位上的能手。在沈阳市以南的安平采石场上，现在有四百多名过去的游民在这里采伐建筑石料。他们每天工作八小时，每月能生产出五千多立方公尺的建筑石料。今年上半年，他们给国家采出了三万五千九百多立方公尺的建筑用石，超过原计划37％。
    沈阳地方国营建新工厂里有一百四十多名过去的游民在制瓦车间劳动。他们能够给国家制造各种水泥瓦、菱苦土瓦和水泥管子。过去曾经多年流落在街巷从事盗窃生活的张述奎、孔庆年等人，现在都已经成为一等技术工人，他们和全车间的工人展开社会主义劳动竞赛，7月份曾经被评为全厂的模范车间。
    这一批在旧社会染上了各种恶习的游民，现在在劳动中都得到了教育和改造。他们住在国家建筑的宿舍里，八小时工作后，可以学习文化并进行正当的娱乐活动。由于国家对他们实行按劳取酬的工资待遇，他们的生活改善了，有许多人已经结了婚，有的人和从前的妻子复婚，又重新安家立业。
