    The Aura of Niu Er
    In the rain, a person wearing a soaked blue jacket, covered in mud, barged through a public bus; shouting loudly:
    "Make way, make way! Be careful I don't get your clothes dirty!" A woman was a little slow to move, and a patch of mud and blue immediately stained her white clothes.
    "Could you please squeeze a little slower?"
    "Afraid of being squeezed? Go home, it's not crowded at home!"
    "Look, you've stained my clothes!"
    "Then haven't you gotten a bargain? I'm not asking you for money for the color, what else do you have to say?"
    From him, we smelled the aura of Niu Er from the "Yang Zhi Sells His Knife" story in Water Margin.

    牛二气息
    雨天，一个披着淋湿了的蓝褂子的人，沾泥带水，在公共汽车里，横冲直撞；一面大声吆喝：
    “让让，让让！小心叫我弄脏了你的衣裳！”一个妇女回避得慢了一点，雪白的衣服上立刻染上了一片污泥和蓝色。
    “请您慢一点挤好不好？”
    “怕挤？回家去，家里不挤！”
    “您瞧，您把我的衣服染了？”
    “那你不是沾便宜了吗？我不找你要颜色钱，你还有什么可说的呢？”
    从他身上，我们嗅到了水浒传“杨志卖刀”里牛二的气息。	姚玉霞
