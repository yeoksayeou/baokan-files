Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Chen reports: This year, nearly two-thirds of the tens of thousands of tons of equipment used to construct Anshan Iron and Steel Company will be manufactured by China's own machinery and electrical factories.

An official from the Equipment Department of Anshan Iron and Steel stated to the reporter that three or four years ago, the vast majority of the equipment used to construct Anshan Iron and Steel was manufactured in the Soviet Union, but this year is different. This year, the amount of mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and coking equipment manufactured domestically has increased by more than 10,000 tons compared to last year. As a result, the proportion of equipment supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel by domestic factories has increased from over 40% last year to over 60% this year.

In Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steelmaking Plant, currently China's largest new-type steelmaking plant, rows of brand-new large steelmaking furnaces stretch from the south to the north side of the plant. Li Bingjun, a veteran foreman involved in the construction of this plant, said that almost all of the furnace body equipment of the steelmaking furnace is manufactured domestically. The tilting machine, which can easily tilt over a thousand tons of steelmaking furnace and molten steel, is a complex piece of equipment. The No. 1 and No. 2 steelmaking furnaces in this plant are still equipped with Soviet-made tilting machines, but the No. 3 and No. 4 steelmaking furnaces, as well as several others currently under construction, will be equipped with tilting machines manufactured in China.

One month ago, Anshan Iron and Steel's fifth automated blast furnace officially went into production. Standing next to this blast furnace, I saw workers skillfully operating the automated equipment for production. Xu Juliang, the furnace chief of this blast furnace, told the reporter that almost all of the more than one hundred pieces of equipment used in this blast furnace, including the weighing car that can weigh several hundred tons, the giant hoist, and the molten iron ladles, slag ladles, and charging hoppers, were manufactured by machinery and electrical factories in Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, and Shanghai, with the exception of a few pieces of equipment such as blowers.

At the construction site of the new sintering plant, which is eight or nine stories high and currently under construction, workers are installing sintering machines from the Soviet Union. However, a technician told the reporter that in a few months, sintering machines manufactured in China will be installed alongside these machines from the Soviet Union. The wide belt conveyors, crushers, sintered ore mixing machines, and cranes, stretching nearly ten li across the entire plant, are also all manufactured in China.

The reporter has visited many construction sites at Anshan Iron and Steel. In these projects, there are more and more pieces of equipment that bear the mark of being manufactured in China. An engineer from the Equipment Department of Anshan Iron and Steel once said to the reporter: "For many years, we have eagerly hoped to independently build our country's metallurgical industry. In New China, we are getting closer and closer to this beautiful aspiration with each passing day."

    我国机械和电器工业发展快
    鞍钢今年建设用的设备大半是国产品
    新华社鞍山18日电　新华社记者李沉报道：今年，建设鞍山钢铁公司的数万吨设备将近有三分之二是我国机械、电器工厂自己制造的。
    鞍钢设备处的一位负责人告诉记者说，三、四年前，建设鞍钢的设备绝大部分都是苏联制造的，但是今年不同了。今年国内制造的采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢和炼焦等设备比去年增加了一万多吨。这样，国内各工厂供应鞍钢的设备就由去年的占全部设备的40％多提高到今年的60％以上了。
    在我国目前最大的新型炼钢厂——鞍钢第二炼钢厂里，从厂房的南边一直延伸到北边，排列着一座座崭新的大型炼钢炉。建设这个工厂的一个老工长李秉钧说，差不多整座炼钢炉的炉体设备全都是由国内制造的。能把一千多吨重的炼钢炉和钢水轻易地倾倒过来的倾动机，是一项复杂的设备。这个厂的一号、二号炼钢炉还是安装苏联制造的倾动机，但是三号、四号和正在建设的几座炼钢炉，就要安装我国自己制造的倾动机了。
    一个月以前，鞍钢第五座自动化高炉正式投入了生产。我站在这座高炉旁边，看到工人们正在熟练地操纵着自动化的设备进行生产。这座高炉的炉长徐矩良告诉记者说，这座高炉用的能称好几百吨重的称量车，巨大的卷扬机，以及铁水罐、铁渣罐、装料罐等一百多项设备，除了鼓风机等少数设备以外，几乎全部都是沈阳、大连、抚顺、上海等机械、电器工厂制造的。
    在正在建设中的有八、九层楼高的新烧结厂工地，工人正在安装苏联来的烧结机。但是一个技术人员告诉记者说，再过几个月我国自己制造的烧结机就要和苏联来的这些机器并排地安装在一起了。贯穿在全厂将近十里路长的宽阔的皮带运输机和破碎机、烧结矿混合机、吊车等，也都是我国自己制造的。
    记者曾经访问过鞍钢的许多建设工地。在这些工程中，标志着我国自己制造的设备越来越多了。鞍钢设备处的一个工程师曾对记者说过：“多少年来我们热望能够独立建设祖国的冶金工业。在新中国，现在离这个美好的愿望一天比一天近了。”
