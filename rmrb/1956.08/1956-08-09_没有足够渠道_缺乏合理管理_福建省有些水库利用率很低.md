Title: Insufficient Channels, Lack of Proper Management: Some Reservoirs in Fujian Province Have Very Low Utilization Rates

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Gong Renzuo reports: Reservoirs built in Fujian Province last winter and this spring have played a certain role in the current fight against drought, but the usage is far from satisfactory. The utilization rate of some important reservoirs is very low.

The Tingxi Reservoir in Tong'an County should irrigate 200,000 mu, but the current actual irrigated area is 77,000 mu. The Lingxi Reservoir in Hui'an County can irrigate 100,000 mu of land, but currently only irrigates 10,000 mu.

Why is there such a big difference between the area that some reservoirs should irrigate and the area that is currently irrigated? According to reports from various places, the reasons are:

First, after the reservoirs were built, all the main canals, branch canals, and small ditches were not excavated, resulting in the inability to deliver water from the reservoirs. Reservoirs such as Tingxi, Dengyun, Douding, and Houwu were all in a hurry to mobilize farmers to open canals and dig ditches day and night only when the drought was serious and water was urgently needed but the stored water could not flow down. The Dengyun Reservoir in the suburbs of Fuzhou was completed in early April, and the remaining water conveyance channels were handed over to the masses of Yuefeng and Hengyu townships to excavate themselves. However, because the higher authorities did not supervise strictly and the masses were busy with spring planting, the canal excavation work was put on hold and basically did not start.

Second, after the reservoirs were built, irrigation management committees were not immediately established to strengthen irrigation management. Generally, the farmland on both sides of the upper reaches of the canals is fully supplied with water, the middle reaches are lightly supplied, and the tail end only gets a trickle. Here's an example: The township head and Party branch secretary of Yuefeng Township in the suburbs of Fuzhou were too lazy to mobilize the masses to open canals, so they diverted the water from the reservoir into a stream, which flowed through three or four li of dry sandy channel before being introduced to the ridges and flooding the fields one by one. The 62,000 cubic meters of water released from the reservoir in eight days and eight nights only irrigated a little over 100 mu. This amount of water could normally irrigate 3,000 mu.

Originally, when building a reservoir, it would be best to seize the opportunity after the reservoir is completed and organize the manpower and materials used to build the reservoir to also excavate the canals. In the past, however, most places in Fujian Province would withdraw the commanding personnel, technical personnel, and laborers after the reservoir was built, leaving the task of digging canals to the local district and township governments and the peasant masses. The peasants themselves face many difficulties in excavation.

### 没有足够渠道　缺乏合理管理  福建省有些水库利用率很低

    没有足够渠道　缺乏合理管理
    福建省有些水库利用率很低
    新华社福州7日电　新华社记者龚人左报道：福建省去冬今春兴修的水库，在目前抗旱斗争中已经发挥一定作用，但是使用情况远不能令人满意。一些重要水库利用率很低。
    同安县汀溪水库应该灌溉亩数为二十万亩，目前实际灌溉亩数是七万七千亩。惠安县菱溪水库能灌溉十万亩田，目前仅灌了一万亩。
    一些水库的应该灌溉亩数和目前实际灌溉亩数为什么相差这么多呢？根据各地反映，其原因是：
    一、筑起了水库后没有接连下来把所有干渠、支渠、毛渠开掘出来，以致造成水库有水送不出。汀溪、登云、斗顶、后吴等水库，都是到旱情严重了、需水急迫而积水流不下来时，才急急忙忙动员农民日夜来开渠挖沟。福州市郊登云水库四月初建成，剩下的输水渠道交给岳峰、横屿两乡群众自己开挖，可是因为上级督促不严，群众忙于春种，挖渠道工作就搁了下来，基本上没有动工。
    二、建筑起水库后没有立即成立水库灌溉管理委员会，加强灌溉管理。一般情况是，渠道上游两岸农田水吃得饱饱的，中游是吃得浅浅的，水尾吃到的只是点滴。有这样一个例子，福州市郊岳峰乡乡长和党支书懒于动员群众开渠道，把水库里的水引到一条溪里，流经三、四里长的干涸沙道，再引进田埂，逐丘漫流。水库在八日八夜放出的六万二千方水，只灌了一百多亩。而这些水通常是可以灌三千亩。
    本来修建水库时，最好在水库筑好后接着就趁热打铁组织建筑水库的人力物力把渠道也开挖好。而过去福建省各地多半是水库筑好后，指挥人员、技术人员以及民工就撤走了。把挖渠道的事交给当地区、乡政府和农民群众。农民自己开挖是有不少困难的。
