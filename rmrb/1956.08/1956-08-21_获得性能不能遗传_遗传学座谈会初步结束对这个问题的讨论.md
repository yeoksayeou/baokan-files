Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 18th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Xinchu reports: As of the 17th, the genetics symposium preliminarily concluded its discussion on whether acquired characteristics can be inherited.

Biologist He Dingjie described at the genetics symposium the changes in his nearly twenty years of teaching genetics: Early on, based on Darwin's theory of evolution, he believed that acquired characteristics (new traits produced by organisms during development due to adaptation to external conditions) could be inherited. For example, domestic ducks evolved from wild ducks; because they used their wings less and their feet more, the feet of domestic ducks are heavier than their wings, while the opposite is true for wild ducks. Later, someone cut off the tails of mice for many generations, but the mice born still had tails, so it was said that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. He said that after liberation, he learned that acquired characteristics could indeed be inherited.

At this symposium, this is still a matter of debate. For the past ten days, the focus of the symposium has been on the issue of spring wheat changing into winter wheat and winter wheat changing into spring wheat. At the same time, the issue of asexual hybrids was also discussed. These two facts are important arguments for some who believe that acquired characteristics can be inherited.

Several scientists presented the results of their own experiments at the meeting. Xu Bao, a young agricultural worker, introduced the experiment conducted by the Northeast Agricultural Research Institute in Gongzhuling starting in 1949, using methods of changing living conditions to transform spring wheat into winter wheat. In 1952, their experiment was successful. It has now been planted for four generations. The materials they used were spring wheat varieties from northern Northeast, where there has never been winter wheat. At the same time, they also conducted experiments to prove that the spring wheat they used was not mixed with winter wheat.

During the discussion, one opinion was that the materials they used were not pure, and that most of the wheat died after being sown, with only a few surviving. This was the effect of selection; because the spring wheat originally harbored recessive genetic factors (latent mutations), that is, factors with winter wheat characteristics, and once they encountered suitable developmental conditions, these winter wheat characteristics would be manifested.

Subsequently, it was pointed out that the reasons for the emergence of latent mutations should be revealed in order to clarify the essence of the problem. The Michurin school believes that acquired characteristics can be inherited, but this does not mean that all acquired characteristics must be inherited.

Some people believe that the effect of selection (like a sieve) exists, but the effect caused by environmental conditions is the main one. Selection is carried out on the basis of variations caused by the environment, and selection can consolidate variations.

### 获得性能不能遗传  遗传学座谈会初步结束对这个问题的讨论

    获得性能不能遗传
    遗传学座谈会初步结束对这个问题的讨论
    新华社青岛18日电　新华社记者吕新初报道：遗传学座谈会到十七日为止，初步结束了关于获得性能不能遗传的讨论。
    生物学家何定杰在遗传学座谈会上叙述了他近二十年来教授遗传学经历的变化：早先根据达尔文的进化论，认为后天获得性（生物体在发育过程中由于适应外界条件而产生的新性状）可以遗传，例如家鸭是野鸭变来的，由于少用翅膀，多用脚，所以家鸭的脚比翅膀重，野鸭则相反。后来有人割老鼠尾巴，割了很多代，结果老鼠生下来的老鼠还是有尾巴，所以说获得性不能遗传。他说，解放以后知道获得性还是可以遗传的。
    在这次座谈会上，这还是一个争论的问题。十几天来，座谈会争论的重点是春小麦变冬小麦和冬小麦变春小麦的问题。同时，也谈到了无性杂种的问题。这两件事实是有些人认为获得性可以遗传的重要论据。
    有几位科学家在会上提出他自己实验的结果。青年农学工作者徐豹介绍了东北农业科学研究所1949年开始在公主岭用改变生活条件的方法，使春小麦变为冬小麦的实验。1952年，他们的实验获得成功。现在已经种了四代。他们采用的材料是东北北部春小麦的品种，当地从来没有冬小麦。同时他们又作过实验，证明所采用的春小麦，没有混杂冬小麦。
    讨论的时候，有一种意见认为他们采用的材料不纯，小麦播下去以后多数死了，少数成活，这是选择的作用；是因为春小麦本来就潜伏着隐性的遗传因子（潜伏突变），即具有冬小麦性质的因子，一旦碰到适宜的发育条件，这种冬小麦的性质就显现出来。
    接着，有人指出，应该揭发潜伏突变产生原因，才能把问题实质搞清楚。米丘林学派认为后天获得性可以遗传，但并不是说所有一切的后天获得性全都一定要遗传。
    有些人认为选择（好像筛子一样）的作用是有的，但是环境条件引起的作用是主要的，选择是在环境引起变异的基础上进行的，选择可以巩固变异。
