    Is Eating Tadpoles Really Effective for Contraception?
    Recently, various newspapers published a single remedy for contraception by eating tadpoles, introduced by traditional Chinese medicine doctor Ye Xichun (Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health), which aroused great interest among people across the country, especially women. In Zhejiang, some people called newspapers and hospitals to inquire, while others wrote letters to newspapers, hospitals, and Dr. Ye Xichun to inquire. Now, many married young women are swallowing tadpoles alive. In the joint state-private Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory in Gongchen District, a suburb of Hangzhou, some female workers secretly use bowls and noodle boxes to catch tadpoles and swallow them alive, and some pregnant female workers also catch tadpoles and swallow them alive as an abortifacient. Gongchen District is a district in the suburbs of Hangzhou where schistosomiasis is relatively prevalent. The Xishi River where the female workers catch tadpoles not only has schistosoma parasites, but also hookworm eggs, ascaris eggs, and other parasites. The river water is dirty and smelly. Will the female workers swallow other parasite eggs along with the tadpoles when they swallow them alive? Could the tadpoles be intermediate hosts for schistosomiasis? These questions make the factory's medical staff very anxious. Section Chief Yu of the factory's health section called the Hangzhou Municipal Health Bureau for instructions, but the Health Bureau found it difficult to answer. The newspaper reported that tadpole contraception is "safe, reliable, and has no side effects," and that 95 percent can achieve contraception, while 5 percent are ineffective. Why is it effective? Why is it ineffective? How can it be guaranteed to be "safe, reliable, and have no side effects" to catch tadpoles in ditches and ponds where parasites may be present and swallow them alive?
    I went to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health to understand the effect of tadpole contraception, but they also found it difficult to answer. Wang Xiaochun, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine at the Provincial Department of Health's Traditional Chinese Medicine Department, said: "Now various newspapers have published this news one after another, especially the *Health News*, which represents the Central Ministry of Health, even used 'Tadpoles Can Prevent Pregnancy' as the title to answer readers' questions on July 13, as if the Ministry of Health has affirmed its efficacy." He believes that before the health department has conducted a scientific test on this single remedy and made a conclusion, in order to ensure people's health, relevant departments must dissuade people from blindly swallowing it.
    Dr. Ye Xichun said to me: "The single remedy for tadpole contraception has been passed down by word of mouth, with no written records and no scientific basis to test. It is only said to be simple, economical, safe, reliable, and without any side effects." The *Beijing Daily* once published a report interviewing Dr. Ye Xichun, saying that the "experiment" of taking tadpoles for contraception "has been conducted on no less than a hundred people," and that "it is at least completely effective for more than 95 percent of people, and only a few people have given birth within five years." He said that this report was wrong, and that the hundred people was a rough estimate. He only talked to people about this contraceptive remedy verbally, and had no way of knowing whether the other party swallowed it or not. Therefore, the 95 percent effectiveness is also exaggerated. He said that it is probably 70 to 80 percent effective, but this number is also an estimate from gatherings with friends, without any factual basis. Then he said, "It is difficult to check the examples, and I dare not fabricate them out of thin air, risk the wrath of the world, and deceive all the women in China." Finally, he said, "If I had known that Representative Shao Lizhi was going to speak about this at the meeting, I would not have mentioned it, because it is still under research."
    Regarding the effect of the single remedy for tadpole contraception, this is the situation I have learned. Because this single remedy was proposed by Representative Shao Lizhi in his speech at the National People's Congress meeting, it has attracted special attention. I believe that the *People's Daily* should adopt a responsible attitude to explain the truth to the masses.

### 吃蝌蚪真的能够避孕吗

    吃蝌蚪真的能够避孕吗
    最近，各地报纸刊登了叶熙春中医师（浙江省卫生厅副厅长）介绍的吃蝌蚪避孕的单方以后，引起了全国人民特别是妇女界极大的兴趣。在浙江，有的打电话给报社、医院询问，有的写信给报社、医院以及叶熙春医师询问。现在许多已经结婚的青年妇女都活吞起蝌蚪来了。设在杭州市郊拱宸区的公私合营杭州棉纺织厂里，有的女工悄悄地用碗、面盒去捞蝌蚪活吞，有的怀孕女工也去捞蝌蚪当作打胎药物活吞。拱宸区是杭州市郊血吸虫病流行较严重的一个地区，女工们打捞蝌蚪的西施河不但有血吸虫寄生，而且还有钩虫卵、蛔虫卵等其他寄生虫寄生，河水脏臭。女工们活吞蝌蚪会不会将其他寄生虫卵也一起吞下去呢？蝌蚪会不会是血吸虫的中间宿主？这些问题使得这个厂的医务人员很着急。这个厂的卫生科俞科长打电话请示杭州市卫生局，卫生局也难以答复。报上介绍蝌蚪避孕是“稳当可靠，没有任何副作用”，又说百分之九十五可达到避孕，百分之五无效。为什么会有效？为什么会无效？在寄生虫可能寄生的河沟、池塘里把蝌蚪捞出来活吞，又怎样能保证它“稳当可靠，没有任何副作用”呢？
    我到浙江省卫生厅了解蝌蚪避孕的效果，他们也很难答复。省卫生厅中医处中医师王晓春说：“现在各报都纷纷登载这个消息，特别是代表中央卫生部发言的健康报在七月十三日竟以‘蝌蚪可以避孕’为题来答读者问，好像卫生部已经肯定了它的效用似的。”他认为在卫生部门没有对这个单方进行科学的检验作出结论以前，为了保证人民健康，有关部门必须劝止盲目吞服。
    叶熙春医师对我说：“蝌蚪避孕单方是口口相传而来，无书籍记载，亦无科学根据可考，只传说简便、省钱、稳当可靠和无任何副作用”。北京日报曾登载过访问叶熙春医师的报道中说，服蝌蚪避孕的“试验已不下百十余人”，“至少对百分之九十五以上的人是完全有效的，只有少数人在五年内生育过”。他表示这个报道有错误，百十人是大概估计的。他把这个避孕单方介绍给人也只是口头上同人谈谈，到底对方吞了没有无从知道。因此，百分之九十五有效也有夸大，他说大概百分之七十到八十有效，但这个数字也是朋友聚谈中的估计，无事实根据。接着他又说“例子难查，而不敢无中生有，冒天下之大不韪，欺骗全中国妇女界”。最后他又说：“我早知邵力子代表要在会上发言讲这点，我就不谈了，因为尚待研究。”
    关于蝌蚪避孕单方的效果，根据我已经了解到的情况就是这些。因为这个单方是邵力子代表在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言中提出的，已引起人们特别关心。我认为人民日报应该采取负责的态度向群众说明真相。
