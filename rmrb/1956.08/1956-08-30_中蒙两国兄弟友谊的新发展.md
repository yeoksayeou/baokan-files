    New Development of Brotherly Friendship Between China and Mongolia
    After friendly talks between the government representatives of China and Mongolia, the "Agreement on Economic and Technical Assistance from the People's Republic of China to the Mongolian People's Republic" has been signed in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic. According to this agreement, the Chinese government will provide the Mongolian People's Republic with 160 million rubles of free aid from 1956 to 1959 to help Mongolia in its industrial, agricultural, and urban construction, and provide machinery, construction materials, and various technical personnel. This agreement marks a further development of the brotherly friendship and economic cooperation between China and Mongolia, which is a joyous event for the people of our two countries to celebrate together.
    The Mongolian People's Republic is our brotherly neighbor. The people of China and Mongolia have historically had close relations and a long-standing friendship. After the Mongolian people achieved the victory of the revolution in 1921, they gave the greatest sympathy and sincere support to the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, thus establishing a deep friendship between our two peoples. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China have established and greatly developed the friendship between China and Mongolia on a new basis. Since the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement in 1952, the friendly cooperation between China and Mongolia has entered a new stage of all-round development. In recent years, the volume of trade between the two countries has grown rapidly, and this year's trade volume will increase nearly sevenfold compared to 1951. At the same time, cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries have also grown, which has played an important role in promoting the common development of the two countries' economic construction and strengthening the friendship between the two peoples. The opening of the Beijing-Ulaanbaatar railway in January this year has shortened the distance between our two countries and provided more convenient conditions for friendly cooperation between the two countries. The signing of the Ulaanbaatar Agreement this time has written a new page in the history of Sino-Mongolian friendship, and it will certainly have a significant impact on strengthening the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The continuous strengthening and development of friendly cooperation between China and Mongolia not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the two peoples but also helps to strengthen the strength of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the heroic and hardworking Mongolian people have overcome countless difficulties through thirty-five years of efforts, have achieved brilliant achievements in national construction, and have made great contributions to the struggle against imperialist aggression and safeguarding international peace. However, due to historical and natural conditions, the Mongolian people still face certain difficulties in economic construction today. The Chinese people greatly admire the spirit of hard struggle of the brotherly Mongolian people and the great achievements they have made. At the same time, we are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the Mongolian people in construction and are willing to provide assistance to the best of our ability. The Chinese government's decision to provide economic and technical assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic this time fully reflects the deep feelings and aspirations of the Chinese people.
    The signing of the Ulaanbaatar Agreement this time once again embodies the superiority of the new type of international relations of socialism. The establishment of this relationship is for the common prosperity of the two countries' economies, for peace, friendship, and the promotion of people's welfare. The People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic are both socialist countries in Asia. In the big family of the socialist camp, each member country can overcome the difficulties in economic construction through mutual assistance and reasonable international division of labor, thereby greatly accelerating economic development. This economic assistance from China to Mongolia was formulated based on Mongolia's actual needs, and it will undoubtedly play a certain role in promoting Mongolia's economic construction and improving people's lives. The economic development of the Mongolian People's Republic is also adding strength to the entire socialist camp, and it will also provide better conditions for further developing economic cooperation between China and Mongolia. Therefore, this is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of China and Mongolia, and also in line with the interests of world peace, democracy, and socialism.
    In order to implement the construction plan stipulated in the agreement, a large number of Chinese engineering and technical personnel and workers will go to Mongolia to cooperate with the Mongolian people. This will further deepen the mutual understanding and close feelings between the two peoples, and enable the two peoples to better exchange their construction experience. We believe that after the common labor and wisdom of the Chinese and Mongolian peoples are condensed together, they will surely create brilliant fruits and create new records of the great friendship between the two countries. We hail the continuous development of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, and congratulate the Mongolian people on achieving new and greater achievements in socialist construction and the struggle to defend peace.

    中蒙两国兄弟友谊的新发展
    中蒙两国政府代表经过友好的会谈，已经在蒙古人民共和国的首都乌兰巴托签订了“关于中华人民共和国给予蒙古人民共和国经济和技术援助的协定”。根据这个协定，我国政府将在1956年到1959年内给予蒙古人民共和国一亿六千万卢布的无偿援助，以帮助蒙古进行工业、农业和城市建设，并提供机器设备、建筑器材和各种技术人员。这个协定标志着中蒙两国兄弟般的友谊和经济合作的进一步发展，这是我们两国人民同声欢庆的喜事。
    蒙古人民共和国是我们的兄弟邻邦。中蒙两国人民在历史上有着密切的关系和悠久的友谊。蒙古人民在1921年取得了革命的胜利以后，对于中国人民的革命斗争曾给予最大的同情和真诚的支援，因而使我们两国人民建立了深厚的友谊。中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，使中蒙两国的友谊在新的基础上建立并大大地发展起来。1952年中蒙经济和文化合作协定签订后，中蒙两国的友好合作进入了全面发展的新阶段。几年以来，两国之间的贸易额迅速增长，今年的贸易额将比1951年增加近七倍。同时，两国的文化交流和人民之间的友好往来也日益发展，这对于促进两国经济建设的共同发展和加强两国人民的友谊都起了重要的作用。今年一月北京—乌兰巴托铁路的通车，缩短了我们两国之间的距离，为两国的友好合作提供了更加便利的条件。而这次乌兰巴托协定的签订，在中蒙的友谊史上又写下了新的一页，它对于加强两国的兄弟友谊和合作必将发生重大的作用。中蒙两国友好合作的不断加强和发展，不仅符合两国人民的利益和愿望，而且有助于加强以苏联为首的世界和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量。
    在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在伟大苏联的真诚无私的援助下，英勇勤劳的蒙古人民经过三十五年来的努力，已经战胜了无数的困难，在国家建设上取得了光辉的成就，并在反对帝国主义侵略和维护国际和平的斗争中作出了巨大的贡献。但是，由于历史条件和自然条件的限制，蒙古人民今天在经济建设中仍然存在着一定的困难。中国人民十分敬佩兄弟般的蒙古人民艰苦奋斗的精神和他们所获得的伟大成就，同时我们也深切地关怀着蒙古人民建设中的困难，愿意尽力地给予援助。我国政府这次对蒙古人民共和国进行经济和技术援助的决定，充分地反映了中国人民的这种深厚的感情和愿望。
    这次乌兰巴托协定的签订，又一次体现了社会主义的新型国际关系的优越性。这种关系的建立是为了达到两国经济的共同繁荣，为了和平、友谊和增进人民的福利。中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国，都是亚洲的社会主义国家。在社会主义阵营的大家庭中，每个成员国家都可以通过互相帮助和合理的国际分工来克服经济建设中的困难，从而大大地加速经济的发展。这次我国对蒙古的经济援助，就是根据蒙古的实际需要而拟订的，它无疑将对促进蒙古的经济建设和改善人民的生活起一定的作用。而蒙古人民共和国经济的发展，也就是为整个社会主义阵营增加了力量，同时也将为进一步发展中蒙两国的经济合作提供更好的条件。因此，这是符合中蒙两国人民的根本利益的，也是符合世界和平、民主和社会主义的利益的。
    为了执行协定中规定的建设计划，我国大批工程技术人员和工人将要到蒙古去，同蒙古人民携手合作。这就将进一步加深两国人民的相互了解和亲密的感情，并使两国人民更好地交流彼此的建设经验。我们相信，中蒙两国人民共同的劳动和智慧凝结在一起之后，必将创造出光辉灿烂的果实，创造出两国伟大友谊的新纪录。我们欢呼中蒙两国人民牢不可破的友谊的不断发展，并祝贺蒙古人民在社会主义建设和保卫和平的斗争中，获得新的更大的成就。
