    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Tokyo News: The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting this morning and decided that the final decision on Prime Minister Hatoyama's trip to Moscow to break the deadlock in Soviet-Japanese negotiations would be made after Foreign Minister Shigemitsu returns home.
    Cabinet members unanimously agreed at the meeting that Shigemitsu should be recalled home quickly. Deputy Foreign Minister Takasaki Tatsunosuke has already sent a telegram to Shigemitsu recalling him home.
    This afternoon, the ruling party of Japan held another leaders' meeting to discuss Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union and the issue of breaking the deadlock in Soviet-Japanese negotiations. The meeting also agreed to wait for Shigemitsu to return home and listen to his detailed report on the Soviet-Japanese negotiations before deciding on a course of action.
    According to Kyodo News, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held a "private meeting" with Shigemitsu in London on August 19. Prior to this, according to a Reuters Washington dispatch, U.S. diplomatic circles expected Shigemitsu to receive strong support from "friendly governments" in London to reject the Soviet peace treaty conditions. Reuters said Dulles was expected to encourage Shigemitsu to insist on the position that the Soviet-held islands of Kunashiri and Etorofu be transferred to Japan during the meeting.

    日本内阁会议决定要迅速召回重光
    再决定鸠山赴苏打开苏日谈判僵局
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天上午举行内阁会议，决定首相鸠山去莫斯科打开苏日谈判僵局一事要等到外务相重光回国以后再作最后决定。
    内阁阁员在会上一致认为要迅速地把重光召回国来。代理外务相高碕达之助已经向重光发出了召他回国的电报。
    今天下午，日本执政党又举行首脑会议，讨论了鸠山访苏和打开苏日谈判僵局问题。会议也认为要等重光回国，听取他的关于苏日谈判的详细报告以后再决定态度。
    据共同社报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经在八月十九日在伦敦同重光举行了一次“私下会谈”。在这以前，据路透社华盛顿消息说，美国外交界人士预料重光在伦敦会得到“友好政府”的大力支持来拒绝苏联的和约条件。路透社说，预料杜勒斯在会谈中会鼓励重光坚持要求把苏联领土国后岛和择捉岛移交给日本的立场。
