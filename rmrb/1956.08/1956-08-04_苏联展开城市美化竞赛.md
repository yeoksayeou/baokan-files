    苏联展开城市美化竞赛
    新华社据苏联报纸消息　高加索最近出现了一种新型的竞赛，这是城市之间的建筑、美化工作和改善文化生活服务方面的竞赛。
    这个竞赛是在纳尔奇克、皮亚季戈尔斯克和奥尔忠尼启则三个城市的劳动人民之间展开的。经过这些城市的苏维埃会议的广泛讨论以后，竞赛者提出了具体的竞赛保证。
    奥尔忠尼启则的居民已经开始行动起来。每逢星期天，数以千计的人参加劳动。家庭主妇、老人和儿童积极参加了城市的美化工作。
    奥尔忠尼启则的劳动人民决定要建设十八公里瓦斯管道，建成二万多平方公尺住宅，种植六万多株树木，铺设新的电车道。
    皮亚季戈尔斯克人保证在今年年底前除了建成四千三百平方公尺住房，建设新的电车路线和柏油马路外，还要建筑新的浴室、游泳池、露天剧场、产妇院和电视中心等。
