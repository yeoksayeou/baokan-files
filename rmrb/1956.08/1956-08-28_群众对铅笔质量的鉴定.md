    Public Assessment of Pencil Quality
    The "Zhonghua" drafting pencil is a product of the Shanghai China Pencil Company Factory No. 1, a joint state-private enterprise. The lead core of this pencil has very good elasticity, is not easily broken, and does not scratch the paper when writing, making it a good pencil for drafting. If the wear resistance were better, it could truly replace imported goods. Li

    The 6B Sanxing pencil is a product of Shanghai China Pencil Company Factory No. 1. The lead core of this pencil has good elasticity, is not easily broken, has a dark color, writes smoothly, does not scratch the paper, and has a suitable hardness, making it a very good soft pencil for drawing.
    Good pencils suitable for general writing include: the "Dazhong" pencil, produced by Shanghai Joint State-Private China Pencil Company Factory No. 1, whose lead core has a suitable hardness and smoothness; the "Good Student" pencil, which is a good product among low-end goods, but the lead core color is dark, and the writing is not bright; the "Great Wall" eraser-tipped pencil, whose color is the same as the "Good Student" pencil, writes smoother than the "Good Student" pencil, and the eraser is firmly attached. The disadvantage is that the wood is soft on one side and hard on the other, making it difficult to sharpen. The "Diary" pencil is a relatively thin, small pencil with a sleeve, produced by Shanghai China Pencil Company Factory No. 1. Its lead core strength is higher than that of general writing pencils, making it a good product among graphite pencils. Lin

    The joint state-private China Pencil Company produces a "Sanxing Qinglian Color-Changing Pencil." We are all happy that China can manufacture this kind of pencil. One day, I and several other comrades each bought four or five pencils. When we went back and used a knife to sharpen them, they broke before we could even sharpen a point. We almost sharpened one pencil to the point where we couldn't hold it, and still couldn't get a point. I was afraid that my sharpening method was not correct, so I carefully tried to sharpen another one, but still couldn't get a point. I asked others, and it was the same. Wang Bo

    The production technology section of the Huaibei Salt Bureau received several Sanxing red and blue pencils, which are products of the joint state-private China Pencil Company Factory No. 2. These pencils break as soon as they are sharpened, breaking wherever they are sharpened. Lao Tan

    I bought a color-changing pencil manufactured by the joint state-private Sanxing Pencil Factory at the cooperative. I bought it back and sharpened it with a quick knife. To my disappointment, the lead core broke every time I sharpened a fraction of an inch. I found three experienced pencil sharpeners to sharpen it, and the result was the same. Spending 11 cents and 15 minutes of labor resulted in a pile of wood shavings and broken lead cores.

    The 353 all-red pencil produced by the joint state-private Sanxing Pencil Factory looks beautiful on the outside, with its red paint and gold trademark. But the quality is very bad, and the lead keeps breaking. I sharpened away two-thirds of the pencil without being able to use it, which made me so angry that I had to throw it into the drawer.

    群众对铅笔质量的鉴定
    “中华”绘图铅笔，是公私合营上海中国铅笔公司一厂的产品。这种铅笔的铅芯弹力很好，不容易断，写字不划纸，是绘图用的好铅笔。如果耐磨度再好一些，真可以代替进口货了。　李

    6Ｂ三星铅笔，是上海中国铅笔一厂的产品，这种铅笔的铅芯弹性较好，不容易断，色黑，写字滑度好，不划纸，硬度合适，是很好的画图用的软铅笔。
    适合一般书写用的好铅笔有：“大众”铅笔，上海公私合营中国铅笔公司一厂出品，铅芯硬度、滑度都很合适；“好学生”铅笔，是低挡货里的好品，就是铅芯颜色暗，写出字来不鲜明；“长城”皮头铅笔，颜色同“好学生”铅笔相同，写字比“好学生”铅笔滑，皮头装得牢固，缺点是木材一面软一面硬，削的时候费劲，“日记”铅笔，是一种比较细、小，带套子的铅笔，是上海中国铅笔公司一厂的产品。它比一般书写铅笔的铅芯强度都高，是石墨铅笔里的好品。　林

    公私合营中国铅笔公司出产了一种“三星青莲变色铅笔”，我们都为中国能制造这种铅笔而高兴。有一天我和另外几个同志，每人买了四、五支。回去用小刀一削，不等削出笔尖就断了，快把一支铅笔削得拿不住了，还没削出尖来。我恐怕削的方法不当，又小心地试着削另外一支，还是削不出尖来，我问了问别人，也是如此。　王勃

    淮北盐务局生产技术科，领了好几支三星红蓝铅笔，这是公私合营中国铅笔公司二厂的产品，这种铅笔一削就断，削到那里，就断到那里。　老谭

    我在合作社买了一支公私合营三星铅笔厂制造的变色铅笔，买回来用一把很快的小刀削起来。扫兴得很，每削出一分长，铅芯就断。我找了三个削铅笔有经验的人来削，结果也是同样的命运。花了一角一分钱和十五分钟的劳动，换来的竟是一堆木屑和断了的铅芯。

    公私合营三星铅笔厂出品的353全红铅笔，从外表来看，油漆漆得红润润的，还印着金色的商标，可够美的了。谁知质量很坏，老是断铅，一支铅笔削去三分之二，还没用上，气得我只好把它扔进抽屉里。　方红
