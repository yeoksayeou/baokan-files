The Ministry of Agriculture Instructs Typhoon-Affected Areas to Vigorously Help Farmers Rescue Livestock

(Our report) The Ministry of Agriculture issued a telegram on August 9, requesting the agricultural departments of Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei provinces, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, to vigorously help farmers do a good job in the aftermath and rescue of livestock. The telegram said:

The areas affected by this typhoon have suffered serious damage not only to crops, but also certain losses to animal husbandry. It is hoped that agricultural departments at all levels will follow the spirit of the State Council's emergency instructions on rescuing typhoon disasters and vigorously lead and help farmers do the following livestock aftermath and rescue work:

	1. For lost livestock, agricultural cooperatives should be mobilized to organize manpower to actively search.

	2. For livestock in areas where water cannot be cleared temporarily and feed is lacking, agricultural cooperatives should be helped to transfer them in an organized manner to grassland areas for feeding, and agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas should be mobilized to share grazing land or accept entrusted feeding.

	3. Feed that has been wetted by heavy rain should be mobilized by agricultural cooperatives to organize manpower for turning and drying to prevent mold and spoilage, which may cause livestock poisoning. For unrecoverable crops, they should be harvested in time as fodder.

	4. For livestock in disaster areas that cannot be transferred, the agricultural departments should consult with the grain and supply and marketing departments to find ways to quickly supply some commercial feed. For livestock that really cannot be kept, contact the supply and marketing cooperatives and food companies for purchase, and deal with them separately in a planned manner to prevent indiscriminate slaughter.

	5. Livestock are prone to epidemics after floods, and disease prevention and animal protection work should be strengthened.

	6. While rescuing crops, agricultural departments in various places must pay attention to rescuing livestock. Animal husbandry and veterinary cadres of agricultural technology extension stations and cadres of animal husbandry and veterinary stations must all be dispatched to do a good job in livestock rescue.

    农业部指示遭受台风侵袭地区
    大力帮助农民救护牲畜
    本报讯：农业部八月九日发出电报，要求遭受台风侵袭的福建、江西、湖南、湖北、河南、安徽、江苏、浙江、山西、山东、河北等省农业厅和上海市农林局，大力帮助农民做好家畜善后救护工作。电报说：
    这次受台风侵袭的地区，不但农作物遭受严重伤害，畜牧业也受到一定损失，希各级农业部门遵照国务院关于抢救台风灾害紧急指示的精神，大力领导帮助农民做好以下的家畜善后救护工作。
    1．对失散的牲畜应该动员农业社组织人力积极寻找。
    2．对积水一时不能退清缺乏饲料地区的牲畜，应该帮助农业社有组织地转移到有草地区饲养，并且要动员非灾区的农业社分让牧地或接受寄养。
    3．大雨后被淋湿的饲料应动员农业社组织人力进行翻晒，以防霉烂变质，引起家畜中毒事情。对于不可挽救的农作物应及时收割作饲草。
    4．对无法转移的灾区牲畜，应由农业部门与粮食、供销部门洽商设法迅速供应一些商品饲料。对实在无法继续饲养的牲畜应与供销社和食品公司联系收购，有计划地分别加以处理，防止滥宰。
    5．水灾后牲畜容易发生疫病，应加强防疫保畜工作。
    6．各地农业部门在抢救农作物的同时，必须注意抢救牲畜。农业技术推广站的畜牧兽医干部和畜牧兽医工作站的干部必须全部出动，搞好牲畜救护工作。
