    Shenyang City Deploys Material Conservation Targets
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Shenyang City recently held its Second Materials Conference. Vice Mayor Chen Hexuan, in his address to the conference, analyzed the current shortage of raw materials, pointing out that the primary reason for the shortage is the unprecedented enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in building socialism and the rapid development of all aspects of the national economy, which has caused the production of raw materials to lag behind demand. For example, national steel production this year increased by 50% compared to last year, while demand increased by more than 69%.
    According to the revised materials needs plan for 1956 after the review at the end of March, the supply of key materials needed for local industrial production, such as iron and steel materials, can only meet 56.2% of the demand, and metallurgical coke can only meet 36.5% of the demand. Other materials such as raw coal, chemical raw materials, and rubber also have problems in terms of specifications and supply time. In terms of basic construction, the steel and cement allocated by the state for the whole year can only meet about half of the needs. In addition, the phenomenon of wasting materials still exists, and the potential for material conservation is still great. For example, for the same type of water pump, the jointly owned Donghe Water Pump Factory uses 611 kilograms of pig iron, while the Hongxiang Water Pump Factory uses 645 kilograms. In addition, the systems for raw material management and use are not yet sound enough, some have not yet used quotas, and situations such as stockpiling and damage are still common. Some economic departments and grassroots enterprises have the erroneous ideas of "reporting less demand and asking for more" and "planning generously but using frugally," deliberately exaggerating plans and blindly asking for more. For example, the Shenyang City General Machinery Industry Company recently calculated that the amount of pig iron over-reported by various units alone reached more than 3,000 tons.
    In order to vigorously conserve raw materials in the second half of this year and ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan, the Shenyang City People's Committee, at the Second Shenyang City Materials Conference, specifically deployed conservation targets to the production units and basic construction units under the city's economic departments. In the second half of this year, local industrial production is required to save 15% of coal, an average of 15% of ferrous metals, including 30% of pig iron, an average of 25% of metallurgical coke, and an average of 10% of non-ferrous metals. Specific conservation targets have also been set for other chemical raw materials, timber, basic construction materials, etc.

    沈阳市布置节约物资指标
    本报讯　沈阳市最近召开了第二次物资会议，陈鹤轩副市长在会上对目前原材料不足的情况作了分析，提出目前原材料不足的主要原因是由于广大职工建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨，国民经济各方面发展迅速，致使原材料生产赶不上需要，如今年全国钢材生产比去年增长50％，而在需要方面却增加到69％以上。
    沈阳市在今年三月底复查后的1956年度物资需要计划，地方工业生产需要的主要物资供应，钢铁材料只能满足需要的56.2％，冶金焦炭只能满足需要的36.5％，其他如原煤、化工原料、橡胶等在规格和供应时间上也都有问题。基本建设方面，国家分配的钢材、水泥全年只能满足需要的一半左右。另外，浪费物资的现象仍然存在，物资潜力还很大。如同样型号的水泵，公私合营东合水泵厂要使用生铁611公斤，而洪祥水泵厂则使用645公斤。另外在原材料管理、使用方面，制度还不够健全，有的还没有使用定额，积压和损坏等情况也还普遍存在。有些经济部门和基层企业存在着“需少报多”，“宽打窄用”的错误思想，有意虚报计划，盲目多要。如最近沈阳市通用机械工业公司算了一笔账，仅生铁一项各单位多报的就达三千多吨。
    为了在今年下半年，大力节约原材料，保证全面完成国家计划，沈阳市人民委员会在沈阳市第二次物资会议上，向市属经济部门的生产单位和基本建设单位，具体布置了节约指标。今年下半年，要求地方工业生产方面，煤节约15％，黑色金属平均节约15％，其中生铁要节约30％，冶金焦炭要平均节约25％，有色金属平均节约10％，其他化工原料、木材、基本建设材料等都提出了具体节约指标。
