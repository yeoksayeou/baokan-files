Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: TASS, Sofia—The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a statement on August 28th regarding the West German authorities' ban on the German Communist Party, stating that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, on behalf of all Communist Party members and all working people, firmly protests this blatant violation of the democratic freedoms of the German people and expresses fraternal solidarity with the German Communist Party and the progressive forces in West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: TASS, New York, August 28th—The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a resolution condemning the decision of the West German Federal Constitutional Court to outlaw the German Communist Party.

The National Committee’s resolution stated: “We condemn those American groups that encouraged this judgment. This encouragement is in line with McCarthyism and does not reflect the sentiments of American democrats.

“We send our warmest greetings to the Communists and other progressive people in West Germany and assure them that democratic opinion will continue to call for opposition to this shameful decision."

    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚共产党中央委员会8月28日就西德当局禁止德国共产党一事发表声明说，保加利亚共产党中央委员会代表全体共产党员和全体劳动人民坚决抗议这种粗暴侵犯德国人民的民主自由的行为，并且对德国共产党和西德的进步力量表示兄弟的声援。
    据新华社29日讯　塔斯社纽约28日讯：美国共产党全国委员会发表决议，谴责西德联邦宪法法院取缔德国共产党的决定。
    全国委员会的决议说：“我们谴责那些鼓励作这种判决的美国集团。这种鼓励是同麦卡锡主义一脉相传的，并不反映美国民主人士的情绪。
    “我们向西德的共产党人和其他进步人士致最热烈的敬礼，并且向他们保证，民主舆论将继续呼吁反对这一可耻的决定。”
