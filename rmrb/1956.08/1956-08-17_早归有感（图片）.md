    Thoughts on Returning Home Early
    Leaving home early in the morning, returning in the middle of the night,
    Every evening spent in meetings without respite.
    Children see me and do not recognize,
    Smiling, they ask, "Where does this guest come from?"

    早归有感
    清早离家半夜回，天天晚上尽开会，儿童相见不相识，笑问客从何处来？
