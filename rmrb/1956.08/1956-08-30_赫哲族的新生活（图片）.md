    The New Life of the Hezhe People (Photo) by Yu Min
    The Hezhe people, who live in Sipai Village, Raohe County, on the banks of the Ussuri River in the northeastern border of our motherland, used to lack guns for hunting and nets for fishing, and did not know how to farm. After liberation, they had enough guns and nets, and the People's Government also helped them learn to farm. The agricultural production cooperative they organized was transferred to an advanced cooperative last winter. Top picture: He Decheng, a 79-year-old hunter, although old, is not showing any weakness, and he still wants to compete with the young hunters in skill. He is preparing to go hunting. Bottom picture: The cooperative's cattle herd grazing by the Ussuri River.

    赫哲族的新生活 　 于敏摄
    住在祖国东北边疆乌苏里江畔饶河县四排村的赫哲族人民，过去打猎缺枪，捕鱼少网，而又不会耕作。解放后，他们有了足够的枪和网，人民政府还帮助他们学会了种田。他们组织的农业生产合作社，在去年冬天转入了高级社。上图：七十九岁的老猎手何德成，年龄虽大，并不示弱，他还要和青年猎手们比一比本领。他正准备出猎。下图：放牧在乌苏里江边的合作社的牛群。
