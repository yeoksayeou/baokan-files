Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 16th: The Fujian Provincial Department of Industry convened a province-wide industrial capital construction meeting from August 4th to 14th, mobilizing all forces to resolve difficulties in the second half of the year's capital construction, such as insufficient supply of materials and lack of design and installation technical personnel. The aim is to strive to complete the entire year's capital construction plan.

Fujian Province's industrial capital construction investment this year is three and a half times greater than last year, but because the plan was approved relatively late, only 15.1% of the annual plan for construction projects was completed in the first half of the year. This greatly increased the amount of construction work in the second half of the year. In addition, the supply of building materials and design capabilities are not keeping up with construction needs. According to preliminary statistics, cement is short by about 27%, steel by about 50%, and 48 projects have not yet been designed. Installation forces will also face difficulties because many projects are concentrated in the fourth quarter for completion.

The meeting, through methods such as prioritizing, investigating the base, and calculating accounts, proposed many effective solutions to difficulties such as insufficient material supply, design, and installation capabilities. Regarding capital construction and equipment materials, the meeting decided to prioritize the supply of materials needed for the two medium-sized sugar factories and sixty-six small sugar and oil factories that must be put into production this year. For the materials lacking in other units, methods such as clearing warehouses, utilizing waste materials, collecting from inside and outside the province, and using substitutes without affecting the quality of the projects will be adopted to solve the problems. In order to solve the problem of designs not keeping up with construction needs, the meeting decided, based on the design capabilities of each special district, to entrust some simple projects originally designed by the Department of Industry to the special districts for independent design. In order to ensure that machines can be installed in a timely manner and put into production after the completion of the construction projects of each factory, the meeting decided that during the particularly tight installation period in the fourth quarter of this year, a group of fitters and power workers will be temporarily transferred from machine factories throughout the province to participate in the installation work, in order to ensure that a number of newly built medium and small sugar factories can be put into production during the sugarcane harvesting season.

After a comprehensive arrangement and balancing of the above issues by the meeting, of the 222 new and expanded projects in the province this year, in addition to the 29 that need to be completed and put into production next year, the rest can be built, installed, and put into production this year.

    动员各方面力量保证实现建设计划
    福建省今年将完成193项工程
    新华社福州16日电　福建省工业厅在八月四日到十四日召开全省工业基本建设会议，动员各方面力量，解决下半年基本建设中器材供应不足，设计、安装技术力量不足等困难，力争完成今年全年的基本建设计划。
    福建省今年工业基本建设投资比去年增加三倍半，但由于计划批准得较迟，上半年建筑工程仅完成全年计划的15.1％。这样就大大增加了下半年的施工量。另外，建筑器材供应、设计力量等也都赶不上施工需要。据初步统计，水泥少27％，钢材少50％左右，并有四十八个项目尚未设计完毕，安装力量也因许多工程都集中到第四季度才能完工而将发生困难。
    这次会议通过排队、摸底、算账等方法，对器材供应、设计和安装力量不足等困难，提出了许多有效的解决办法。关于基本建设和设备器材问题，会议决定首先对今年必须投入生产的二个中型糖厂、六十六个小型糖厂和油厂等所需的物资尽量给予供应；对其他单位所缺的物资，则采用清理仓库、利用废料、到省内外搜集和在不影响工程质量前提下，采用代用品等办法加以解决。为了解决设计赶不上施工需要的问题，会议根据各专区设计能力，决定把有些原来由工业厅负责设计的简单项目交由各专区自行设计。为了使各工厂建筑工程完工后，能及时安装机器、投入生产，会议决定在今年第四季度安装工程特别紧张的时候，将从全省各机器厂临时抽调一批钳工、动力工来参加安装工作，以保证一批新建的中、小型糖厂能在甘蔗收获季节投入生产。
    会议就以上问题进行了全面安排、平衡以后，全省今年新建、扩建的二百二十二个项目中，除二十九个需要在明年才能建设完成和投入生产以外，其余都可以在今年建筑安装完毕和投入生产。
