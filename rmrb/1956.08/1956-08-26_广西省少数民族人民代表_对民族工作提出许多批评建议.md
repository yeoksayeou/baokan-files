Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 24th. People's representatives from the over seven million ethnic minorities in Guangxi Province, including Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnicities, at the fourth session of the first Guangxi Provincial People's Congress, which concluded on the 22nd, raised many criticisms and constructive opinions regarding work in ethnic minority areas within the province.

Some representatives pointed out that the Party's ethnic policies have only been implemented for a few years, while the history of Han chauvinism spans thousands of years. It is inevitable that there will be errors and shortcomings in trying to eliminate thousands of years of ingrained habits in just a few years. These errors and shortcomings require the government to implement the ethnic policies more thoroughly and resolutely correct and improve them.

Zhuang representative and university professor Huang Xianfan said that some leading cadres subjectively believe that certain areas of Zhuang and Han people are "almost the same," and thus do not pay enough attention to ethnic work. This is especially evident in cultural and educational undertakings. For example, in some schools in Luozhai County, where Zhuang and Han people live together, there is insufficient consideration for the admission of Zhuang children, resulting in a very small proportion of ethnic minority students in the schools. Furthermore, less than three-tenths of the members of the Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe are from ethnic minorities. Huang Xianfan also criticized educational institutions for the delay in issuing educational subsidies to ethnic minorities. He also suggested that all cadres in the province universally study the ethnic policies so that these policies can be better implemented.

Regarding the training of ethnic minority cadres, some representatives criticized that in some autonomous organs, Han cadres did not adequately help ethnic minority cadres play their roles. In some places, they are not bold in promoting ethnic minority cadres, subjectively believing that they have poor work abilities and taking over their work, which has dampened the enthusiasm of some ethnic minority cadres. The representatives also pointed out another possible deviation: while eradicating the remnants of Han chauvinistic thought among some Han cadres, it is also necessary to conduct ideological education on ethnic unity, patriotism, and internationalism among ethnic minority cadres to prevent the growth of various local nationalist thoughts.

The representatives believe that taking into account the characteristics of ethnic minority areas is a very important issue. Some cadres, regardless of local and ethnic characteristics, believe that after the advanced stage of agricultural cooperativization in rural areas, everything can be done "handily" and "smoothly." In some cold mountainous areas with thin soil, ethnic minority farmers are forced to engage in close planting of small seedlings, resulting in serious yield reductions due to unsuitable climate, insufficient fertilizer, and manpower. Some cadres also want ethnic minorities in mountainous areas to reduce sideline occupations and grow more grain, resulting in losses outweighing gains.

The representatives suggested that the propaganda departments should be good at using ethnic minority people's favorite ethnic activity forms—Zhuang song gatherings, Dong lusheng festivals, etc.—to publicize ethnic policies. They also hope that the Guangxi Daily will publish more news about the new atmosphere in ethnic minority areas.

### 广西省少数民族人民代表  对民族工作提出许多批评建议

    广西省少数民族人民代表
    对民族工作提出许多批评建议
    据新华社南宁24日电　从广西省七百多万少数民族中来的僮、苗、瑶、侗等族的人民代表，在22日结束的广西省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，对省内民族地区工作提出了许多批评和建设性的意见。
    有的代表指出：党的民族政策实行只有几年，而大民族主义的历史则有几千年。要以几年的工夫消除几千年的积习，就难免没有错误和缺点。这些错误和缺点，需要政府更深入地贯彻执行民族政策，坚决去纠正和改进。
    僮族代表、大学教授黄现璠说，有些领导干部主观地认为某些地区僮族和汉族“差不多”，就不去重视民族工作。尤其表现在文化教育事业方面，如僮、汉族杂居的鹿寨县某些学校，对僮族子弟入学方面，照顾得不够，以致学校中少数民族学生比例很小；又如广西省民族歌舞团中少数民族团员还不到十分之三。黄现璠还对迟迟不发少数民族教育补助费的教育机构提出了批评意见。他还建议全省干部普遍学习一次民族政策，以便这一政策能更好地得到贯彻。
    在培养民族干部方面，有些代表批评有些自治机关里，汉族干部没有很好地帮助少数民族干部发挥作用。有些地方对民族干部不敢大胆提拔，主观地认为他们工作能力差，工作上包办代替，结果挫伤了一些民族干部的工作积极性。代表们同时指出了另一种可能发生的偏向：在铲除某些汉族干部的大民族主义思想残余的同时，也要注意在少数民族干部中进行民族团结、爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，防止各种地方民族主义思想的滋长。
    代表们认为，照顾民族地区特点是一个很重要的问题。有些干部不管地方和民族特点，认为农村高级合作化后，一切事情都可“得心应手”、“办得通”了。在有些气候寒冷土质瘦薄的山区里，也硬要少数民族农民搞小株密植，结果因为气候不宜、肥料人工不够而严重减产。还有些干部要山区少数民族少搞副业，多种粮食，结果得不偿失。
    代表们建议宣传部门要善于利用少数民族喜爱的民族活动形式——僮族歌墟、侗族籚笙会等来宣传民族政策，还希望广西日报多刊登一些民族地区的新气象。
