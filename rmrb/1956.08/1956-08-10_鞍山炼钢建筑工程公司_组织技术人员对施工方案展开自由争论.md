Anshan Steel Construction Engineering Company
Organizes Technical Personnel to Conduct Free Debate on Construction Plans

    (Our Dispatch) The engineering and technical personnel of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company's Steel Construction Engineering Company are currently engaged in a debate on how to handle the groundwater at the foundation of the new coke oven site's chimney.
    The debate was sparked by a disagreement between young technician Zong Fuyu and Chief Engineer Cheng Shitong. Cheng Shitong's opinion was to use piling to handle the groundwater, based on the chimney's height, the high groundwater level, and the strong wind force, requiring the foundation to be solid and durable. Zong Fuyu's opinion was that wells could be dug around the foundation to lower the groundwater level. The wind force calculated during the design exceeded the actual situation, and not piling could still ensure the foundation's solidity and durability. This could also shorten the construction period by forty days, save a large amount of steel, and reduce investment by more than 100,000 yuan. The Party committee and administrative leaders believed that a discussion could be organized to unify understanding and choose a reasonable plan.
    The debate began in early July. Zong Fuyu and Cheng Shitong both actively collected materials from all aspects and went to the site for investigation and research. Zong Fuyu also constantly consulted with workers and technicians, and conducted experiments on reducing the groundwater level on site. Up to now, five discussion meetings have been held, each demonstrating a spirit of seeking truth from facts, daring to raise objections, and also being brave in correcting their own incorrect views. Initially, some engineers felt that a technician's opinion was nothing. However, during the debate, after hearing that Zong Fuyu's opinion had a scientific basis, they changed their views and joined the debate.
    A conclusion to this debate is expected soon. The Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company believes that this kind of debate is very good. In the past, some comrades were unwilling to boldly raise different opinions, and if they were not valued, they would not persist, preventing positive factors from being brought into play. The experience gained in the work could not be systematically summarized, and after the work was done, it was not known what was right and what was wrong, or why it was right and why it was wrong. They decided that after this debate is concluded, they would then launch discussions on technical issues such as "Can large masonry be used in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel?" and "Can bamboo-reinforced concrete be used for large equipment foundations?". They also decided that in the future, before carrying out any new or important project, they would first hold a technical research meeting to fully discuss it; at the end of the project, they would hold another meeting to make a technical summary, and combine these discussions with the advancement of engineering and technical personnel towards science.
    During this debate, the project is still proceeding according to the original plan. (Liaoning Daily)

### 鞍山炼钢建筑工程公司  组织技术人员对施工方案展开自由争论

    鞍山炼钢建筑工程公司
    组织技术人员对施工方案展开自由争论
    本报讯　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司炼钢建筑工程公司的工程技术人员们，正就如何处理新焦炉工地烟囱基础的地下水展开争论。
    争论是由青年技术员宗福腴不同意总工程师程世通的意见引起的。程世通的意见是用打桩的办法处理地下水，根据是烟囱高，地下水位高，风力大，必须保证基础牢固、耐久。宗福腴的意见是可以在基础四周挖井降低地下水位，设计时计算的风力超过了实际情况，不打桩也可以保证基础牢固和耐久，并且可以缩短工期四十天，节省大量钢材，减少十多万元投资。党委和行政领导认为可以组织讨论，通过讨论统一认识，选择合理的方案。
    争论是在七月初开始的。宗福腴和程世通都积极从各方面收集材料，到现场去调查研究，宗福腴还不断向工人和技术人员请教，在现场作了减低地下水位的实验。到现在，已经开了五次讨论会，每次会上都表现了实事求是的精神，敢于提出反对意见，也勇于修正自己不正确的看法。最初，也有个别工程师认为一个技术员的意见没什么，在争论中，听到宗福腴的意见有科学根据，改变了自己的看法，参加到争论里来。
    这项争论最近就可以做出结论。鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司认为这种争论很好，过去有的同志有不同意见不愿大胆提出来，提出来没被重视也不坚持，使积极因素得不到发挥，工作中摸索到的经验不能系统地总结到一起，工作干完了也不知道哪对哪不对，或为什么对为什么不对。他们决定在这项争论结束之后，接着就“鞍钢建设中能否采用大块砌体？”“大型设备基础能否采用竹筋混凝土？”等技术问题展开讨论。他们还决定今后每进行一项新的或重要的工程之前，都先召开技术研究会议，充分展开讨论；工程结束时再召开会议作技术总结，并把这些讨论和工程技术人员向科学进军结合起来。
    在这次争论过程中，工程仍然照原方案进行。（辽宁日报）
