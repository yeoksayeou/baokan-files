Consumer Opinions

    Produce Good Contraceptives
    Domestic male condoms have shortcomings: they are too thick, too brittle, and break easily during use, causing great anxiety.
    The steel rings of domestically produced "vaginal diaphragms" are too hard, the rubber membrane is as stiff as leather, there are too few sizes, and they are too expensive, making them unaffordable for some people. It is hoped that relevant factories will use the best rubber to produce contraceptives, especially to produce more high-quality male condoms.
    The contraceptive cream produced by "Kefa" Pharmaceutical Factory is irritating, causing increased secretions after use. At the same time, the cream is not uniform in consistency, sometimes clear water flows out when the lid is opened; when squeezed harder, it comes out in clumps, making it difficult to use. It is best for the health department to research some non-irritating contraceptive drugs.

    No Shoes for the Elderly
    I wanted to buy my mother a pair of leather shoes. I searched the market and found many styles and colors, but no shoes for old ladies. Finally, I found a pair of black leather shoes with a large round opening, but when I tried them on, they were too narrow. There were no wider ones available, which was very disappointing.
    It is best for shoe manufacturers to not only focus on fast-selling items, but also think about older people.

    Enrich the Colors of Fountain Pen Barrels
    Most of the fountain pens seen in the market are black, and the styles are generally the same. Because of my work, I have two fountain pens; one with blue ink and one with red ink. Because the barrels are all black, I have to look carefully at the brand to tell them apart. It is hoped that fountain pen factories will break the old routine and enrich the colors and styles of pen barrels.

    You Say Before Meals, He Says After Meals
    I don't know why many pharmaceutical factories produce Class One drugs with inconsistent instructions for use and dosage. For example, the instructions for the 0.03g Santonin Calomel tablets manufactured by the local state-owned Guangdong Pharmaceutical Factory state: "Take one tablet every morning on an empty stomach"; the Santonin Calomel tablets produced by the state-owned Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory stipulate: "Adults take two tablets each time, once in the morning and once in the evening after meals"; Tianjin Pharmaceutical Factory's Santonin stipulates: "Adults take three times a day." The same medicine has some that are taken before meals, some after meals; some are taken once a day, and some are taken twice or three times. The dosages also vary greatly.
    The dosage of Santonin should be determined according to age and physical strength, but the prescriptions of each pharmaceutical factory are different, which is very inconvenient to use, especially for those who lack pharmacological knowledge, who find it even more difficult. The health department should stipulate a unified prescription for drastic drugs like Santonin produced by various factories to avoid errors.

    Soap Bigger Than Box
    Recently, I bought a bar of soap from the department store. When I got home, I tried to put it in the box, but it wouldn't fit. I had to cut the soap in half and use it in two pieces. Although this is not a big deal, it also shows that the coordination between factories is not good, otherwise this regret would not have happened.

    We Want Shatterproof Baby Bottles
    The quality of the baby bottles commonly found in the market is too poor. They shatter at the sight of boiling water, and they also shatter when boiled. Mothers hope to buy heat-resistant baby bottles. I wonder if the factories that manufacture baby bottles can do as Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling said, "Give the most precious things to children"!

    Do Not Stop Producing Pacifiers
    After reading Comrade Li Bingru's "Stop Producing Pacifiers" in the "Consumer Suggestions" column of the People's Daily on July 26, I think the problem is not as simple as she says. I am now a grandmother and a great-grandmother. My children were strictly compliant with the so-called "scientific parenting method" when they were young and did not use pacifiers. As a result, they cried and fussed when they were not being fed, and sometimes sucked on their own little hands; if they were given a pacifier, they would fall asleep after sucking on it for a while. My little grandson is the same way. He cries and doesn't sleep when it's not feeding time, but he falls asleep with a pacifier. Pacifiers have no holes and won't suck in air. My little grandson is one year old and growing very well. He has many teeth and his lips are normal and have not been affected in any way. On the contrary, I hope to produce some better quality pacifiers for many mothers, nannies, and children.

### 消费者的意见  生产好的避孕用具

    消费者的意见
    生产好的避孕用具
    国产男用避孕套有缺点：太厚、太脆，一用即破，使人非常担心。
    国产的“阴道隔膜”，钢丝环太硬，胶膜硬得像皮膜，号码少，价钱贵，有些人就买不起。希望有关工厂使用最好的橡胶生产避孕工具，特别是多生产些质量好的男用避孕套。
    “科发”药厂生产的避孕药膏，有刺激性，用后分泌物增多，同时药膏浓稀不匀，有时打开盖子流清水；再用力一挤，出来的又是块子，不好使。卫生部门最好研究一些没有刺激性的避孕用药。

    没有老年人穿的鞋
    我想给母亲买一双皮鞋，在市场上找来找去，感到皮鞋的花样是不少，颜色品种也很多，就是没有老太太穿的鞋。最后总算找到一双大圆口的黑皮鞋，回去一试又太瘦了，换肥的又没有，使人很失望。
    制鞋部门最好不要只看到畅销的热货，也为年纪大些的人想一想。

    丰富钢笔笔杆的颜色
    在市场上看到的钢笔，多半都是黑色的，样式也大体相同。我因为工作需要，有两支钢笔；一支上蓝水，一支上红水，因为笔杆都是黑色的，使用时要仔细看看牌子，才能分出来。希望制造钢笔的工厂打破老一套，丰富笔杆的颜色和式样。

    你说饭前他说饭后
    不知道为什么很多制药厂出品的一类药，吃法和剂量都不统一。比如地方国营广东制药厂制造的0.03克的山道年甘汞片，说明上写着“每晨空腹时服一片”；国营西南制药厂生产的山道年甘汞片却规定：“成人每次二片、早晚饭后服一次”；天津制药厂的山道年规定：“成人日服三次”。一样的药，有饭前吃的，有饭后吃的；有日服一次的、也有两次或三次的，剂量也相差很远。
    山道年应该根据年龄大小和身体强弱来决定用量，但是各制药厂的处方不同，用起来很不方便，特别是缺乏药理知识的人，更加感到困难。卫生部门对各厂生产的像山道年这样的剧烈的药品，应该规定统一处方，以避免发生错误。

    香皂比盒大
    最近我从百货公司买来一块香皂，回到家往盒里一放，怎么也放不进去，只好把香皂切开，一块变成两块用。这虽然不是什么大事，但也说明工厂和工厂之间联系配合得不好，否则就不会有这种憾事了。

    我们要不炸的奶瓶
    市场上常见的奶瓶，质量都太坏，一见开水就炸，煮的时候也炸。做母亲的，都希望能买到耐高热的奶瓶。不知道制造奶瓶的工厂能不能做到像宋庆龄副委员长说的“把最宝贵的东西给予儿童”！

    不要停止生产假奶头
    读了七月二十六日人民日报“消费者建议”栏内李冰如同志写的“停止生产假奶头”后，我认为问题不像她说的那么简单。我现在是祖母，又是外祖母。我的儿女幼时都是严格遵照所谓“科学育儿法”，不含假奶头的。结果不吃奶的时候大哭大闹，有时就吃自己的小手；如果给他们假奶头，含一会也就睡了。我的小孙子也是一样，没到吃奶的时间，好哭不睡，含了假奶头就睡了。假奶头没有眼，不会吸进空气。我的小孙子一周岁了，长得很好，牙齿长了很多，唇部也很正常，没受任何影响。倒是希望为许许多多母亲、保姆和孩子们生产一些质量更好的假奶头。
