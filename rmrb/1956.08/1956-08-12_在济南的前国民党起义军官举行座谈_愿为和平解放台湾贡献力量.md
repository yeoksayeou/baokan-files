Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th - The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened a symposium on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan on the 6th. Forty-six former Kuomintang officers of high and middle ranks who revolted in Jinan City attended the symposium.

Zhang Xuanwu, CPPCC member of Shandong Province, counselor of the provincial government, and former Lieutenant General Commander of the 41st Army of the Kuomintang, said in his speech: "I am most touched by Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn, earnest, and generous attitude and deep hope in explaining the policies to the Chiang army in Taiwan. From my own experience and the fact that the People's Government has consistently treated uprising personnel with generosity over the past seven years, it powerfully tells the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan that they should no longer have any doubt or concerns about their future." He also said that we do not lack the strength to liberate Taiwan; our goal of peacefully liberating Taiwan is to prevent the people of Taiwan from suffering casualties and property losses. In order to peacefully liberate Taiwan at an early date, we should do everything possible to strengthen propaganda to Taiwan and explain our policies.

Lin Zhaowu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jinan Municipal CPPCC and former Lieutenant General Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Sichuan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters, said, "For several years, American imperialism has used the pretext of preventing Communist 'aggression' to create the so-called 'free world' in Taiwan. In fact, it wants to use this base to attack the peaceful camp. We have a responsibility to use our past old friends, old colleagues, and relatives to explain the policies to the Kuomintang military and political personnel." Yang Da, former commander of the Kuomintang Provisional 9th Army, said: "What is hindering the liberation of Taiwan is American imperialism. If we can peacefully liberate Taiwan, it will be another major blow to American imperialism." He also said: "Peaceful liberation of Taiwan is possible because the Chinese people have a strong sense of national self-esteem. In the Chiang army in Taiwan, some people followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past and made contributions to China's independence and freedom. For several years, under the rule of American imperialism in Taiwan, they have completely become a colonial army. As long as they understand the policies, they will definitely be willing to get rid of the life of slavery, relying on others, and looking to others for guidance."

Zhang Pei, Standing Committee member of the Shandong Provincial CPPCC and former Lieutenant General Director of the Armored Corps Department of the Kuomintang Army University, Wang Dazhong, former Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang 41st Army working in the Shandong Provincial Department of Finance, and Cai Jinkang, member of the Shandong Provincial CPPCC and former Major General Brigade Commander of the Kuomintang Security Second Brigade, also spoke at the symposium. In their speeches, they all expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Finally, the symposium adopted the "Letter to the Chiang Army Officers and Soldiers in Taiwan."

    在济南的前国民党起义军官举行座谈
    愿为和平解放台湾贡献力量
    新华社济南10日电　中国人民政治协商会议山东省委员会在六日召开了和平解放台湾座谈会。参加座谈会的有在济南市的前国民党起义的高、中级军官四十六人。
    山东省的政协委员、省府参事、前国民党四十一军中将军长张宣武发言说：“我最受感动的是周恩来总理以严正、恳切、宽大的态度和深切的希望向台湾蒋军交代了政策。从我亲身的体验和七年来人民政府一贯优厚的对待起义人员的事实，有力地告诉了台湾国民党军政人员，对他们的未来不应当再有丝毫的怀疑和顾虑。”他又说，我们不是没有力量解放台湾，我们要和平解放台湾的目的，是不叫台湾人民遭到伤亡，财物遭到损失。为了早日和平解放台湾，我们应当尽一切方法加强对台湾的宣传，说明我们的政策。
    济南市的政协副秘书长、前国民党川鄂绥署中将秘书长林肇戊说，“数年来，美国帝国主义以防止共产党‘侵略’为借口，而造成台湾所谓‘自由世界’，其实他是想借这个基地向和平阵营进攻。我们有责任利用我们过去的老朋友、老同事以及亲戚等关系，向国民党军政人员说明政策。”前国民党暂九军军长杨达说：“阻挠解放台湾的是美国帝国主义，我们若能和平解放台湾，将对美国帝国主义又是一次很大的打击。”他又说：“和平解放台湾是可能的，因为中国人民的民族自尊心很强，在台湾蒋军中，过去有些人跟随孙中山先生为中国的独立自由立过功勋。数年来他们在台湾美国帝国主义的统治下，完全成了殖民地军队。只要他们懂得政策，他们一定也愿意早日摆脱寄人篱下、仰人鼻息的奴役生活。”
    在座谈会上发言的还有山东省政协常务委员、前国民党陆军大学机甲系中将主任章培，在山东省财政厅工作的前国民党四十一军参谋长王大中和山东省政协委员、前国民党保安二旅少将旅长蔡晋康等人。他们在发言中都表示愿为和平解放台湾贡献出自己的一切力量。
    最后，座谈会通过了“致台湾蒋军官兵书”。
