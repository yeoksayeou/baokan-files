Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Washington dispatch: Following the U.S. State Department spokesman White's statement at a press conference on August 6th that American journalists would not be allowed to visit China, the State Department issued a formal statement on August 7th banning American citizens (including journalists) from visiting China.

The State Department's statement said: "The State Department has taken this opportunity to conduct a thorough review of its policy of not issuing passports for travel to Communist China. After such a study, it has been decided that not issuing such passports remains the policy of the State Department."

The only defense that the U.S. State Department has put forward for its special "policy" is that China is still detaining American prisoners who have committed crimes in China. It insists that this situation creates "special obstacles" for Americans to visit China.

State Department press officer Lipp, after reading the above statement, said that American journalists visiting China would be considered "a violation of government policy and law" and could be sentenced to up to five years in prison or a fine of up to two thousand dollars.

The State Department's statement immediately aroused dissatisfaction in the American press. A spokesman for NBC said that people strongly opposed the State Department's view. The "New York Post" pointed out that the State Department's decision was a "dangerous, self-defeating, ridiculous act." The "New York Times" also published an editorial expressing regret over the State Department's attitude. It said: "We hope the State Department will eventually see that it is wise to help all newspapers cover news around the world as much as their abilities and wishes allow."

    美国国务院用刑罚威胁美国新闻记者
    再次发表声明禁止美国人来中国访问
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：继美国国务院发言人怀特八月六日在记者招待会上表示不准美国记者访问中国后，国务院又在八月七日发表正式声明，禁止美国公民（包括新闻记者）到中国访问。
    国务院的声明说：“国务院趁这个机会对它的不发去共产党中国旅行的护照的政策进行了缜密的研究。在经过这种研究以后决定，不发这种护照仍然是国务院的政策。”
    美国国务院为自己这特别的“政策”所提出的唯一辩护就是：中国仍然拘留着在中国犯罪的美国犯人。它硬说这种情况给美国人来中国访问造成了“特殊的障碍”。
    美国国务院新闻发布官里普在宣读了上述声明后表示，美国记者访问中国将被认为是“违反（美国）政府的政策和法律”，可能被判处五年以内的徒刑或两千美元以下的罚款。
    美国国务院的声明马上在美国新闻界引起了不满。美国全国广播公司的发言人说，人们强烈地反对国务院的看法。“纽约邮报”指出，国务院的决定是“危险的自招失败的荒唐举动”。“纽约时报”也发表社论对国务院的态度表示遗憾。它说：“我们希望国务院最后会看到帮助各种报纸根据能力和愿望尽量采访全世界的新闻是明智的。”
