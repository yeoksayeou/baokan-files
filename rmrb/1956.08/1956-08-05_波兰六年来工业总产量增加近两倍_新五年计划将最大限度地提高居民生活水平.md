Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 4th. Warsaw newspapers published on August 3rd the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party regarding the results of the Six-Year Plan and the basic guidelines for the 1956-1960 Five-Year Plan.

The resolution stated that in the past six years, People's Poland has made a significant step forward in the development of productive forces and the socialist transformation of the national economy. The tremendous development of the entire national economy, particularly heavy industry – the foundation for further growth – is a historic achievement of the past period. The total output of socialist industry increased by 185% compared to 1949, with production means (Category I) increasing by 196% and consumer goods (Category II) increasing by 171.4%. This means that the tasks of the Six-Year Plan in terms of industrial product production have been completed. In 1955, the final year of the Six-Year Plan, People's Poland produced 4.426 million tons of steel and 94.5 million tons of coal.

The Six-Year Plan was a period of massive investment and expanded construction. During this period, many new industrial enterprises were established, including the Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta, a chemical complex in Kędzierzyn, and many large power plants, machine-building factories, and mines.

The implementation of the Six-Year Plan particularly demonstrated the significance of Poland's economic cooperation with socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, whose assistance played a major role in the development of the Polish economy.

The resolution pointed out that during the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, in addition to significant achievements, there were objective difficulties and some mistakes were made. For example, insufficient development of agricultural production was a weakness of the national economy during the Six-Year Plan. The progress of implementing the Six-Year Plan was uneven, and the disproportionate phenomena in the development of various sectors of the national economy were not eliminated.

The resolution then pointed out that guaranteeing the maximum improvement of the living standards of urban and rural residents under the current conditions is the main task of the Five-Year Plan. During the Five-Year Plan, the average real wages of workers and the income of farmers should increase by 30%. The national income of the country should increase by 50% in five years. The total industrial output is planned to increase by 53% to 57%, and the output of agricultural products is planned to increase by 25% compared to 1955. By 1960, the last year of the Five-Year Plan, coal production will increase to 110 million tons, steel production will increase to 7.2 million tons, and electricity production will increase to 29.85 billion kilowatt-hours.

The resolution also stipulated tasks regarding the development of machine manufacturing, chemical, light industry, and other industrial sectors, and stipulated the tasks of Party organizations and state organs in ensuring the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

    波兰六年来工业总产量增加近两倍
    新五年计划将最大限度地提高居民生活水平
    新华社华沙4日电　华沙各报八月三日刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议关于六年计划执行结果和1956—1960年五年计划基本方针的决议。
    决议说，在过去六年中，人民波兰在生产力的发展和国民经济的社会主义改造方面向前迈进了一大步。整个国民经济，特别是国民经济进一步增长的基础——重工业——的巨大发展是过去一段时期所取得的历史性成就。社会主义工业总产量比1949年增加了185％，其中生产资料（第一部类）增加了196％，消费资料（第二部类）增加了171.4％。这就是说，六年计划在工业产品生产方面的任务已经完成了。在六年计划的最后一年——1955年，人民波兰生产了四百四十二万六千吨钢，九千四百五十万吨煤。
    六年计划是大量投资和扩大建设的时期。在这一时期内，建立了许多新的工业企业，其中包括诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业、肯杰仁的一个化学联合工厂、许多大的发电站、机器制造工厂和矿井等。
    在执行六年计划的过程中特别表明了波兰同社会主义阵营各国、首先同苏联的经济合作的意义，苏联的帮助在发展波兰经济中起了重大的作用。
    决议指出，在执行六年计划期间，除了取得重大的成就以外，一方面碰到了客观的困难，另一方面犯了一些错误。例如，农业生产没有得到足够的发展是六年计划期间国民经济的弱点。执行六年计划的进程是不均衡的，在发展国民经济各部门中的不成比例的现象没有得到消除。
    决议接着指出，保证在现在条件下最大限度地提高城乡居民的生活水平，是五年计划的主要任务。在五年计划期间，职工的平均实际工资和农民的收入应该增加30％。国家的国民收入在五年内应该增加50％。工业总产量规定增加53％到57％，农产品产量规定比1955年增加25％。到五年计划的最后一年——1960年，采煤量将提高到一亿一千万吨，钢产量提高到七百二十万吨，电力产量提高到二百九十八亿五千万度。
    决议还规定了关于发展机器制造业、化学、轻工业和其他工业部门的任务，规定了党组织和国家机关在保证完成五年计划方面的任务。
