Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency directive on flood prevention and disaster relief work on the 7th.

    After analyzing the rainfall and disaster situation, the directive emphasized that disaster relief, flood prevention, and production should be the central tasks in areas that have already suffered disasters. For villages surrounded by water, every effort must be made to ensure that no one who can be rescued loses their life. Grain and livestock must be actively rescued. At the same time, peasants should be organized to salvage crops, retrieve damaged crops, quickly drain water, and strive to plant more buckwheat, vegetables, and avoid delaying the sowing of wheat.

    The directive requires all economic enterprises and transportation departments throughout the province to organize all forces to provide disaster areas with supplies, especially daily necessities such as grain, coal, salt, and matches, to "supply the disaster victims wherever they go." The directive requires local health departments to strengthen medical and health work in disaster areas, and postal and telecommunications departments to ensure the smooth flow of communication lines. It also requires all disaster-stricken areas to immediately begin organizing diversified sideline production, give play to the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and launch mass movements for production self-reliance and economizing to overcome famine.

    The directive also stated that in all areas with flood prevention tasks, especially in the downstream areas of various rivers, there should be no relaxation or complacency. Sufficient forces should be organized to lead the masses in continuous struggle against floods. At the same time, leadership over agricultural and sideline production should be strengthened to achieve victory in both preventing and minimizing disasters and increasing production. All areas that have not suffered from floods should concentrate their efforts on strengthening field late-stage management to ensure the overfulfillment of production increase plans. Currently, attention should be paid to activities such as cultivating and weeding, topdressing and replenishing fertilizer, supporting and earthing up plants, preventing pests and diseases, as well as artificial pollination of corn and fine pruning of cotton.
