    Chinese Youth Support the Struggle of the German People
    Liao Chengzhi
    Chinese youth need peace because we are building our own happy lives. The disasters of war have not faded from our memories, and we know that world peace is indivisible. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about peace in Asia, and equally concerned about peace in Europe and every corner of the world. We feel immense resentment towards those who attempt to destroy the happy future of the younger generation with the flames of war. In recent years, the international situation has tended to ease, and the idea of peaceful coexistence has increasingly taken root in people's hearts. Chinese youth, like peace-loving youth all over the world, are encouraged by this.
    But at this very moment, the Federal Constitutional Court of West Germany declared the German Communist Party illegal. Although the West German authorities have imposed fabricated "crimes" on the German Communist Party, it is not difficult for people to see what their real purpose is.
    In 1933, Hitler set fire to the Reichstag and also placed the "crime" on the Communists, beginning a large-scale persecution of German peace and democratic forces, which resulted in countless young people being driven to the battlefield as cannon fodder. Today, the Adenauer regime is precisely copying Hitler's old tricks, taking the German Communist Party, the most active force in safeguarding national interests and peace, as the first step in attacking all domestic peace and democratic forces. They vainly attempt to cover the eyes and mouths of the German people by trampling on the most basic democratic rights, so that they can unscrupulously accelerate the establishment of revanchist armies, create new international tensions, and prepare for new wars.
    But their calculations are wrong. More than a decade ago, Hitler and his ilk could not avoid being buried without a trace. In today's era, when the power of the people is unprecedentedly strong, can the fate of those who want to follow his old path be any better? Listen, aren't protests already resounding in Germany, in Europe, and around the world!
    Chinese youth firmly support the just struggle of the German people and the German Communist Party against the Adenauer regime's anti-peace and anti-democratic measures, and deeply believe that all anti-people currents and whirlpools will eventually disappear into the torrent of the powerful people's forces. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the German people will surely victoriously defend their democratic rights and stop this anti-peace conspiracy.

    中国青年支持德国人民的斗争
    廖承志
    中国青年需要和平，因为我们正在建设自己的幸福生活。战争的灾难还没有从我们的记忆中消失，我们知道世界和平不可分，所以我们既深切关怀亚洲的和平，也同样地关心欧洲和世界各个角落的和平。我们对那些企图以战火来毁灭青年一代的幸福将来的人们感到无比的愤恨。近年来，国际局势趋于缓和，和平共处的思想日益深入人心，中国青年和全世界爱好和平的青年一样因此而欢欣鼓舞。
    但是就在这个时候，却发生了西德联邦宪法法院宣布德国共产党为非法的事件。尽管西德当局把莫须有的“罪名”强加到德国共产党的身上，但人们不难看出他们真正目的的所在。
    1933年，希特勒纵火焚烧国会，也将“罪名”强加在共产党人身上，而开始了对德国和平民主力量的大规模迫害，结果使无数青年被驱上战场，成为炮灰。今天，阿登纳政权正是抄袭希特勒的故伎，把打击维护民族利益与和平事业最积极的德国共产党作为打击国内一切和平民主力量的第一步。他们妄图以这种践踏最基本民主权利的办法来掩尽德国人民的耳目和嘴巴，好让他们为所欲为地加紧建立复仇主义军队，制造新的国际紧张局势，准备新的战争。
    但是他们的算盘打错了，在十多年前希特勒之流还不免死无葬身之地，难道在人民力量空前强大的今天，想走他的老路的人们的下场还会好些吗？听吧，在德国、在欧洲、在世界各地，不是已经发出了一片的抗议声吗！
    中国青年坚决支持德国人民和德国共产党为反对阿登纳政权的反和平、反民主的措施而进行的正义的斗争，并深信一切反人民的逆流和漩涡终将消失在强大的人民力量的巨流里。德国人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，必能胜利地保卫自己的民主权利，制止这个反和平的阴谋。
