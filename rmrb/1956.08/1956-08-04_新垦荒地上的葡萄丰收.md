Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 3rd. More than 1,000 mu of grapes at the State-owned Minquan Farm in Henan Province are nearing maturity. Bunches of fruit hanging on the vines are changing color. The best varieties, such as "Rose Fragrant" and "Black Han," have turned from yellow to purple. According to the lowest estimate, this year's harvest could exceed 230,000 jin.

　　This farm is located near Yifeng Village in Lankao County. This area was once the center of the old Yellow River course and, just a few years ago, was a desolate, uninhabited sandy wasteland. Since the construction of shelterbelts, the situation has changed dramatically. The Minquan Farm has utilized this sandy wasteland, which is most suitable for growing grapes and apples, and has opened up orchards, planting more than 1,000 mu of grapes and 3,000 mu of apples.

　　In order to strive for the first bumper harvest in the vineyard, the horticultural workers have strengthened management since the spring, generally carrying out seven pruning and pest control operations on the grapes.

　　This year, some of the apple trees have also begun to bear fruit.

    新垦荒地上的葡萄丰收
    新华社郑州3日电　河南省国营民权农场的一千多亩葡萄已接近成熟，挂满在蔓藤上的成串果实正在变色。品种最好的“玫瑰香”和“黑罕”等葡萄已由黄变紫。根据最低估计，今年可以收二十三万多斤。
    这个农场在兰考县仪封村附近。这里过去是黄河故道中心，几年前还是一片沙荒，渺无人烟。自从营造防护林后，情况大变。民权农场利用这一带最适宜种植葡萄和苹果的沙荒，开辟了果园，种植了一千多亩葡萄和三千亩苹果。
    为了争取葡萄园第一次丰收，园艺工人从春季起就加强了管理，普遍对葡萄进行了七次修剪和病虫防治工作。
    今年苹果树也有一部开始结实了。
