    This Year's Peak Season in Rural Markets May Be Delayed
    An Investigation Report on the Purchasing Power of Farmers in District One, Liling County, Hunan Province
    Zhang Lisen
    Editor's Note: Currently, some commercial staff have different views on the situation of rural markets after the autumn harvest this year. Some believe that rural markets will definitely be booming after the autumn harvest this year; some believe that the peak season in rural markets may be delayed; some believe that farmers will need to purchase a large number of consumer goods after the autumn harvest this year; some believe that farmers' purchasing power will mainly be used to purchase means of production. But what will the situation of rural markets be like after the autumn harvest this year? We published the investigation materials of Tongliao County's Aid-Village in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on July 23. Today's publication of the investigation materials of District One, Liling County, Hunan Province, is the second article, and these articles are for the reference of comrades engaged in commercial work.
    Liling County, Hunan Province, is a high-yield county with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. District One (Baitu Tan) is a key area for high yields of 1,000 jin. The district has 11,020 households, 51,300 people, 46,000 mu of paddy fields, and 6,000 mu of dry land, with an average of one mu of land per person. Sideline production is mostly making firecrackers, and the income from other sideline occupations accounts for about 70% of the annual monetary income. There are currently eight advanced agricultural production cooperatives and 128 elementary production cooperatives in the district (all are preparing to transition to advanced cooperatives after the autumn harvest). The number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 94% of the total number of farmers in the district.
    Farmers' income increased this year
    After agricultural cooperativization, farmers' enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented level. It is estimated that the average yield of early and late rice per mu in the district can reach 1,150 jin, an increase of 51.4% compared with last year. The total income of various sideline occupations of agricultural cooperatives in the district is estimated to increase by 16.2% compared with last year. In addition to agricultural and sideline income, there is also income from remittances from family members working outside. According to preliminary estimates, after deducting loans from all income, the average per capita income is 46.4 yuan, an increase of 37% compared with last year.
    According to our preliminary investigation in two advanced cooperatives and two townships, the total value of agricultural and sideline production and monetary income this year increased by 30%-40% compared with last year, which is roughly in line with the results of the overall calculation in the district.
    Take the Chuān xī Township Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative as an example. All the farmers in this township have joined the cooperative. Based on the total of 117,100 labor days in the cooperative, an average of 1.464 yuan can be earned per labor day, of which grain and tea oil and other in-kind items worth a total of 1.071 yuan should be distributed, and 0.393 yuan in cash. Calculated on the basis of the population of the township, the average per capita annual distribution is 44.8 yuan in kind and 16.4 yuan in cash; plus the investment in household fertilizer returned to the members and the income from the decentralized operation of sideline occupations by the members, the average per capita monetary income is 50.5 yuan, an increase of about 42% compared with last year.
    According to the materials from Tóngtáng Township (the township has one advanced cooperative and thirteen elementary cooperatives, and 97% of farmers have joined the cooperatives), the average per capita monetary income of the entire township is expected to be 47 yuan this year, an increase of about 30% compared with last year.
    The net commercial retail sales in the
    first half of this year decreased compared
    with the same period last year, excluding
    loan factors
    District One has little land and many people. Farmers have always relied on sideline income in winter and spring to supplement their family life, especially in the first half of the year when the proportion of sideline income is large. Last winter, during the high tide of cooperativization, rural areas concentrated their efforts on forming cooperatives, merging cooperatives, and busying themselves with production planning. Almost all rural labor was invested in field production, and the number of people engaged in sideline production decreased significantly. The income from various sideline occupations decreased by 14.5% compared with the same period last year. Chuān xī Township produced more than 400 boxes of firecrackers last spring, but only 80 boxes this spring. Some members did not have any sideline income this year because they all participated in field labor.
    Due to the decrease in sideline income and the impact of the disaster situation in 1954, the masses have a weak foundation, and poor households generally still account for about 50% in each township.
    After April, the sideline production operated by the members gradually increased, and the supply and marketing cooperatives vigorously carried out the purchase of small native products and waste products, and the rural economic situation has improved. However, except for making firecrackers and temporary work that can quickly obtain income, most of the increased purchasing power of other sideline productions such as pig raising, fish farming, and vegetable growing will be realized in the second half of the year.
    From the perspective of retail commodity circulation, the total retail sales of the pure commercial market in the district increased by 18.2% from January to May this year compared with the same period last year, but a large part of it was the result of the state issuing a large number of various loans and advance payment. Agricultural production cooperatives not only rely entirely on loans to purchase means of production from the market, but also use these loans for relief to poor households and daily expenses of the cooperatives. If the loan factor is excluded, the total retail sales of pure commerce in the district decreased by 4.6% from January to May this year compared with the same period last year.
    From the seasonal changes in sales of various commodities in the first quarter and April and May, April is the period of spring plowing and sowing, when a large number of means of production need to be purchased. The sales of means of production in this month increased more than twice compared with the same period last year. If the sales of means of production are excluded, the total retail sales of pure commerce in April increased by only 0.7% compared with the same period last year. The sales of means of production decreased significantly in May, and the sales of consumer goods became active, increasing by 23.5% compared with the previous month.
    Most of the agricultural and sideline income
    is concentrated in the second half of the year,
    but the currency put into the market before
    the end of the year is estimated to increase little
    Most of the agricultural and sideline income of the district this year is concentrated in the second half of the year, mainly due to the following two factors: wheat, rapeseed and other spring and summer harvest crops are mostly left for the masses to consume themselves, and the amount sold is small. Since last winter and this spring, many sideline productions have decreased, and this bias began to be reversed after April, but some sideline products need to be sold in the fourth quarter and next spring. According to preliminary estimates in Chuān xī Township, the income from selling agricultural and sideline products and engaging in transportation and other labor in the township this year accounts for 23.4% in the first half of the year and 76.6% in the second half of the year.
    According to the situation in this area, the distribution of agricultural cooperatives will be carried out once in late July after the early rice is harvested; the annual final accounts and final distribution will be carried out after November. The Chuān xī Township Advanced Cooperative can produce 16,000 dan of early rice this year. After deducting 7,000 dan for requisition and purchase, and 280 dan for seeds, about 8,720 dan will be distributed to the members, and the average per capita distribution in the township will be 300 jin. The cash obtained by the agricultural cooperatives from selling early rice, after deducting the advance payment for early rice and part of the production loans, is not enough to invest in late rice and sideline production. Therefore, the summer harvest distribution is basically all in kind. The masses in this area are accustomed to eating early rice, and most of the early rice distributed to the members is kept for rations, except for a small number of poor households or households with more sideline occupations who need to sell part of the grain for turnover. The cash needed by ordinary members on a daily basis mainly relies on their own sideline income or borrowing from the cooperative in advance. Therefore, the market retail sales in this district in the third quarter are estimated to not increase compared with the previous period.
    So will the purchasing power of this district be concentrated in the fourth quarter? Judging from the situation in this area, because the harvest of late rice and the final distribution of agricultural cooperatives throughout the year will be after November, some cooperatives may postpone it because the accountants are not proficient. Therefore, the currency distributed to the members and put into the market will basically be in December or later, and it is estimated that the market retail sales in October and November will not increase significantly. According to the rough calculation of the currency income and expenditure in Chuān xī Township this year, after deducting non-commodity expenditures from the total currency income of the township, commodity expenditures account for about 34% in the first half of the year, about 36% in the second half of the year, and about 30% is transferred to next year. In the commodity expenditures in the first half of the year, 28% was realized by relying on national loans and advance payments. The advance payment for early rice needs to be fully repaid after the early rice is harvested, and it is estimated that about half of the agricultural production loans will also be repaid before the end of the year, totaling about 15% of the total currency expenditure in the second half of the year, which means that the purchasing power of this part of the currency has been realized in advance in the first half of the year. This is also an important reason why the increase in purchasing power in the second half of the year is not large.
    The purchasing power in the fourth quarter of this year will increase compared with the third quarter, but it is estimated that it will not increase much. In addition to the impact of the time of late rice harvest and year-end distribution, agricultural cooperatives have very little cash that can be concentrated and controlled before the end of the year, and it is also a reason why it is impossible to purchase a large amount of means of production. According to the responsible comrades of several agricultural cooperatives such as Chuān xī and Guāngmíng, in order to implement the policy of less deduction and more distribution and increase the income of the members as much as possible, almost all cash income at the end of the year, except for repaying part of the loans, will be distributed to the members. The public accumulation and public welfare funds retained by the agricultural cooperatives and the share capital supplemented by some members are basically in-kind items such as seeds, rice straw, sweet potato vines, and pigs and fish that are not up to the standard for sale. To purchase the means of production and other large expenses needed for winter and spring, agricultural production cooperatives mainly rely on pigs fattened with fertilizer and grown fish and other sideline income that have not participated in the distribution, and most of these will be realized in the coming spring.
    In addition, there is another situation that deserves attention. According to the investigation of five typical households, three households are preparing to rebuild new houses next spring, and some self-operated sideline occupations such as raising pigs, chickens and ducks also need to purchase pig breeds, chicken breeds and feed. Judging from the situation in this area, most of the bricks, tiles, wood and carpenters, tilers and some sideline production materials needed for house construction can be solved by the agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, the currency spent by the members will return to the cooperatives, and these money will eventually be turned to production investment by the agricultural cooperatives.
    Based on the above situation, if there are no unexpected disasters, the increase in agricultural and sideline production this year is certain, and the increase in members' income is also certain. However, because most of the agricultural and sideline production and sales are concentrated in the second half of the year, most of the rural monetary income (excluding loans) will also be concentrated in the second half of the year; because the members' income from the summer harvest distribution is all in kind, and the cash obtained by the agricultural cooperatives from selling grain is limited after repaying the loans, it is estimated that the market retail sales in the third quarter will not increase much; because the agricultural cooperatives can only carry out the year-end final accounts and final distribution after November, the growth reflected in the market retail sales in the fourth quarter will mainly be after December. Therefore, judging from the situation in this area, the peak season in the market may not be advanced but delayed.
    Several issues worthy of attention
    First, after agricultural cooperativization, the investment in agricultural and sideline production has increased greatly compared with the individual economy period. However, in the total investment of agricultural cooperatives, a considerable proportion of some means of production is solved by the cooperatives themselves, and there is a gradual increase in the trend. After the implementation of the method of dividing agricultural and sideline occupations and uniformly calculating labor remuneration, the production capacity of some members who can do carpentry and bamboo weaving in some cooperatives exceeds the needs of the cooperative itself, and they have to find ways to go out to solicit work and process for other agricultural cooperatives.
    It should be said that it is reasonable and necessary for agricultural cooperatives to prepare part of the means of production by their own efforts. From the perspective of supply and marketing cooperatives, in the future, to supply agricultural means of production, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research, closely contact with agricultural cooperatives, on the one hand, to avoid blindly operating varieties that agricultural cooperatives can solve themselves; on the other hand, it is more important to deeply understand the varieties, quantity and time required by agricultural cooperatives to purchase various agricultural and sideline production materials from the market, organize the sources of these varieties in many ways, and meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives as fully as possible.
    Second, in areas that mainly produce grain and also produce other cash crops and local specialties, in the past, during the individual economy period, although the output of some cash crops was not large, because of decentralized operation, some farmers produced more, some farmers produced less or did not produce, so there was still a considerable proportion sold in the market. However, after cooperativization, due to the implementation of collective operation and unified distribution, many products are mostly or even entirely left for their own consumption, and the commodity volume has decreased significantly. Take Chuān xī Township as an example, this year's tea, tea oil, palm slices, ramie, etc., under the unified adjustment of the agricultural cooperatives, each household can only be divided into more than one jin of tea, tea oil less than two jin per person, palm slices and ramie are not enough for the members to make raincoats and ropes. However, these products are also materials that the state needs to expand the purchase of. If the trend of reducing the sales volume of these products is allowed to develop, it will inevitably cause market supply tension and affect industrial production and export needs. To fundamentally solve this contradiction, the main thing is to guide agricultural cooperatives to expand the production of these products in a planned way. However, increasing production, especially increasing the production of perennial crops such as tea and palm slices, takes a considerable amount of time to be effective; before the production volume has increased, in order to ensure the state's needs for these products, it is also necessary to carry out propaganda and education work for the members of the agricultural cooperatives, so that they understand the importance of reducing their own consumption as much as possible and selling more products to the state. At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperatives should further strengthen the integration of production and sales with agricultural cooperatives, vigorously carry out the contract system, and actively and systematically guide the production of these products through the contract system, ensure the source of goods, and strengthen the purchase.
    Third, agricultural cooperatives are currently vigorously developing diversified operations. The planning of each cooperative for various sideline productions is generally based on its own production capacity and conditions. They do not know much about the sales channels of the products produced and the sources of raw materials. Therefore, it is easy to produce blind operation, which makes some sideline products encounter difficulties in sales or raw material supply. Therefore, the leading organs and commercial departments at all levels should conduct a comprehensive arrangement and unify the balance plan for the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives, especially those that have problems in sales or raw material supply, according to the specific situation of production, supply and sales, prevent blind production, and prevent agricultural cooperatives from suffering losses.

    今年农村市场旺季可能推迟
    湖南省醴陵县一区农民购买力的调查报告
    张立森
    编者按：目前有些商业工作人员对今年秋后农村市场情况有几种不同的看法，有的认为今年秋后农村市场一定会旺；有的认为农村市场旺季可能推迟；有的认为今年秋后农民需要购买大批生活资料；有的认为农民的购买力将主要用于购买生产资料。但是今年秋后农村市场情况究竟会怎样呢？我们在七月二十三日发表了内蒙古自治区通辽县支援村的调查材料，今天发表的湖南醴陵县一区的调查材料是第二篇，这些文章都供做商业工作的同志作参考。
    湖南省醴陵县是千斤丰产县，一区（白兔潭）又是千斤丰产的重点区。全区有11，020户，51，300人，稻田46，000亩，旱土6，000亩，每人平均有田一亩；副业生产大部分是制鞭炮，加上其他副业收入，占全年货币收入70％左右。全区现有八个高级农业生产合作社和128个低级生产社（秋后准备全部转为高级社），参加农业生产社的农户占全区农户总数94％。
    今年农民收入有增加
    农业合作化后，农民生产积极性空前高涨，估计全区每亩早、晚稻平均产量可达到1，150斤，比上年增产51.4％。全区各农业社全年各项副业总收入估计比上年增加16.2％。除了农副业收入外，还有出外工作的职工汇给家属的款项收入。据初步估算，全部收入在扣除贷款后，每人平均为46.4元，比去年增加37％。
    根据我们在两个高级社和两个乡的初步调查，今年农副业生产总值和货币收入较去年增长30％—40％，和全区算大账的结果大致相符。
    以汆溪乡高级农业生产社为例。这个乡的农民全部都入了社。按全社117，100个劳动日计算，平均每个劳动日可得1.464元，其中应分粮食及茶油等实物共合1.071元，现金0.393元。如按全乡人口计算，平均每人全年可分得实物44.8元，现金16.4元；加上归还社员家肥投资和社员分散经营的副业等收入，平均每人货币收入50.5元，比上年约增加42％。
    根据僮塘乡材料（全乡有一个高级社，十三个低级社，入社农户占97％），全乡全年平均每人货币收入预计为47元，比上年约增长30％。
    今年上半年纯商业的零售
  总额除去贷款的因素比去年同
  期下降
    一区田少人多，农民一向是靠冬、春两季的副业收入来弥补家庭生活，特别是上半年副业收入占的比重大。去冬在合作化高潮中，农村集中力量组社、并社和忙于生产规划。农村劳动力几乎全部投入田间生产，从事副业生产的人数显著减少，各项副业收入比去年同期减少14.5％。汆溪乡去春生产鞭炮四百多箱，今春只生产了八十箱。有些社员今年因全部参加了田间劳动，副业收入全没有了。
    由于副业收入减少，加上1954年灾情影响，群众底子空，各乡困难户一般仍占50％左右。
    四月份以后，社员经营的副业生产逐渐增多，供销社大力开展小土产和废品收购，农村经济情况已有好转。但各项副业生产除做鞭炮和做临时工等能很快得到收益外，其他如养猪、养鱼、种菜等副业生产所增加的购买力大部分将在下半年实现。
    从零售商品流转情况来看，今年一至五月份全区纯商业市场零售额较上年同期增加18.2％，但很大一部分是由于国家大量发放各项贷款和预购款的结果。农业生产社向市场购买生产资料不但完全依靠贷款，就是对困难户生活的救济和社里日常开支，也是绝大部分使用这些贷款。如果除去贷款的因素，今年一至五月份全区纯商业零售总额较去年同期还下降4.6％。
    从第一季度和四、五月份各类商品销售的季节变化来看，四月份正是春耕播种、需要大量购置生产资料的时期，这个月内生产资料的销售比去年同期增加两倍以上。如除去生产资料销售额，四月份纯商业零售总额仅比上年同期增加0.7％。五月份生产资料销售显著减少，生活资料销售转趋活跃，较上月增长23.5％。
    农副业收入绝大部分集中
  在下半年，但年前投入市场的
  货币估计增长不大
    今年全区农副业的收入大部分集中在下半年，主要是由于以下两个因素：小麦、菜籽等春收、夏收作物多半留给群众自己消费，出售量少。去冬今春以来，许多副业生产减少，四月份以后才开始扭转这一偏向，但若干副业生产品需要到第四季度和明春才能出售。根据汆溪乡初步估算，全乡今年出售农副产品和从事搬运等劳动所得货币的收入，上半年占23.4％，下半年占76.6％。
    按照这个地区的情况，农业社分红大约在七月下旬早稻登场后实行一次预分；实行全年决算和最终分配，要在十一月份以后。汆溪乡高级社今年可产早稻16，000担，除去征、购7，000担，及籽种280担，约余8，720担分给社员，全乡平均每人可分300斤。农业社出售早稻所得，除去早稻预购款和部分生产贷款外，余下现金全部用作晚稻及副业生产投资还不够。因而夏收预分，社员所得基本上都是实物。这个地区群众习惯吃早稻，社员所分得的早稻除少数困难户或自己经营副业较多的户需要出售一部分周转粮外，绝大多数都留作口粮。一般社员日常所需现金，主要靠自己的一些副业收入或向社里预借。因此，这个区第三季度市场零售额估计不会比上期增长。
    那么这个区的购买力是不是将集中出现在第四季度呢？就这个地区的情况看来，由于晚稻登场和农业社全年最后分配要在十一月份以后，有些社因为会计不熟练，可能还要推迟。因此，社员分到现金投向市场的货币，基本上要在十二月份或更迟一些，估计十、十一月份市场零售额也不会有很大增长。根据汆溪乡今年货币收支情况粗略的计算，全乡货币收入减除非商品支出后，全部商品支出中，上半年支出约占34％，下半年约占36％，转移到明年使用的约为30％。在上半年的商品支出中，有28％是依靠国家贷款和预购款实现的。早稻预购款在早稻登场后需要全部归还，农业生产贷款估计在年前也要归还一半左右，两项合计约占下半年货币总支出15％，就是说这部分货币的购买力提前在上半年实现了。这也是下半年购买力增长不大的一个重要原因。
    今年第四季度的购买力比第三季度将有增长，但估计不会增长很多，除了由于晚稻收获和年终分配的时间影响外，农业社在年前能够集中支配的现金很少，不可能大量购买生产资料也是一个原因。据汆溪、光明等几个农业社负责同志谈，为了贯彻执行少扣多分，尽可能增加社员收入的方针，年终分配的时候，各项现金收入除偿还部分贷款外，差不多全部都要分给社员，农业社所扣留的公积、公益金和部分社员补交的股金，基本上都是籽种、稻草、薯藤和还不够出售标准的猪、鱼等实物折价。农业生产社要购买冬春所需生产资料及其他大宗开支，主要是靠养肥的猪和长大的鱼和其他一些未能参加分配的副业收入，而这些绝大部分要在明春才能实现。
    另外，还有一个值得注意的情况。根据五个典型户的调查，有三户准备明春翻盖新房，若干自己经营的副业如养猪、养鸡鸭等还需要购买猪种、鸡种及饲料等。就这个地区情况看来，房屋修建所需砖瓦、木料和木工、瓦工和若干副业生产资料，绝大部分可以由农业社解决。因此，社员所支出的这部分货币又将回到社里来，而这些钱最后农业社也是转向生产投资。
    根据以上情况，如果不发生意外灾害，今年农副业增产是肯定的，社员收入增加也是肯定的。但由于农副业生产和出售绝大部分集中在下半年，农村货币收入（不包括贷款）绝大部分也将集中在下半年；由于夏收分配社员所得全部是实物，农业社出售粮食所得现金除归还贷款外，所余有限，因而估计第三季度市场零售不会增加多少；由于农业社在十一月份以后才能实行年终决算和最后分红，反映到第四季度市场零售额的增长主要将在十二月份以后。因此，就这个地区情况看来，市场旺季可能不是提前而是推迟。
    值得注意的几个问题
    第一、农业合作化后，农副业生产投资较个体经济时期有了很大增加。但在农业社投资总额中若干生产资料由社自己解决的占相当大的比例，还有逐渐增加的趋势。在实行农副业分工和统一计算劳动报酬的办法以后，有些社内会做木工、篾工的社员的生产能力超过本社的需要，还要设法出外揽活，替其他农业社加工。
    农业社利用自己力量准备一部分生产资料，这种发展趋势应该说是合理的和必要的。从供销社方面来说，今后供应农业生产资料，就更需要加强调查研究，密切同农业社联系，一方面要避免盲目经营那些农业社可以自己解决的品种；另方面更应当深入了解农业社需要向市场购买的各项农副业生产资料的品种、数量和需要的时间，多方面去组织这些品种的货源，尽可能充分满足农业社需要。
    第二，在以产粮为主、兼产其他经济作物和土特产的地区，过去在个体经济时期，若干经济作物虽然产量不大，但因分散经营，有些农户产的多，有些农户产的少或不产，因而还有相当大的比例在市场出售。但合作化以后，由于实行集体经营和统一分配，有许多产品大部甚至全部留作自己消费，商品量显著减少。以汆溪乡为例，今年生产的茶叶、茶油、棕片、苎麻等，在农业社统一调剂之下，每户只能分到茶叶一斤多，茶油每人不到二斤，棕片、苎麻分给社员打蓑衣、绳子还感不足。但是这些产品也正是国家需要扩大收购的物资，如果听任这些产品出售量减少的趋势发展下去，势必引起市场供应紧张，影响工业生产和出口需要。要根本解决这个矛盾，主要是要指导农业社有计划地扩大这些产品的生产。但增加生产，特别是增加茶叶、棕片等多年生作物的生产，需要经过相当时间才能有效；在生产量尚未提高之前，为了保证国家对这些产品的需要，还需要对农业社社员进行宣传教育工作，使他们了解尽可能减少自己消费，多将产品卖给国家的重要意义。同时供销社应进一步加强同农业社的产销结合，大力开展合同制，通过合同制积极地有计划地指导这些产品的生产，保证货源，加强收购。
    第三，目前农业社正在大力发展多种经营，各社对各项副业生产的规划一般都是根据本身的生产能力和条件考虑的，对于所生产出来的产品销路和所需原料来源的情况就不大了解，因此很容易产生盲目经营，使有些副业产品在销路上或原料供应上发生困难。因此各级领导机关和商业部门对于农业社的副业生产，特别是对那些在销路上或原料供应上有问题的副业生产，应当根据产、供、销的具体情况进行全面安排，统一平衡计划，防止盲目生产，使农业社不致遭受损失。
