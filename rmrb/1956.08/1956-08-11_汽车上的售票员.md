    Bus Conductor
    Zheng Xia
    I had to go to the western suburbs, so I took a public bus.
    It was really crowded. I was squeezed in the crowd, unable to move at all. Coupled with the stuffy weather, I was sweating and feeling dizzy, unable to tell where the bus had gone. Suddenly, I heard a loud girl's voice: "Comrades, please hold on tight, the bus is turning west." I quickly grabbed the handrail, and my body bent eastward with the bus. After the turn, I thought to myself, "This conductor is really good. Thank goodness she called out, otherwise, I would have fallen on someone else." When we arrived at the station, I saw a young girl wearing a white top, holding a child in her arms, walking onto the bus, shouting as she walked: "Comrades, please give up your seat." She put the child down, and immediately went down to help an old lady up.
    The bus started again. It was so crowded, I saw her here and there, I don't know what method she used to weave through the crowd. As far as I could see, it was simply impossible to move.
    In no time, she had sold all the dozens of tickets. She stood at the bus door and said, "For the convenience of passengers, I will introduce the first and last bus times and the driving time..."
    When I first got on the bus, I was a little worried that with so many passengers getting on and off, it would take a lot of time, and the bus would not run on schedule. So after a while, I would check my watch. Now I see that the bus is running exactly as she said, so I feel relieved.
    She saw a little baby sleeping in its mother's arms, so she went over and said with concern: "You are getting off soon, wake your child up, otherwise he will catch a cold when you get off the bus." She said to another passenger: "The old lady in front of you just came from the countryside and doesn't know the way. She is going the same way as you, please take care of her when you get off the bus."
    What kind of thinking, what kind of power supports her in doing this? I decided to talk to her.
    "What's there to talk about?" This girl, named Bai Shulan, said, "All the conductors on public buses in Beijing do this. Everyone has been a passenger, who doesn't know the feelings of passengers?"
    "Isn't everyone who takes the bus in a hurry to do something?" Bai Shulan said: "When I sell tickets, I think in my heart: this person may be going to the construction site to work, that person may be going to the office to do something, another person is probably going to the factory to attend an important meeting, and another must be going to find their relatives... If I sell tickets a little slower, they will be late, and may delay something important. When I think of this, my enthusiasm comes."

    汽车上的售票员
    郑夏
    有事要到西郊去，我搭了辆公共汽车。
    人真多，我挤站在人群中，动都不能动一下，加上这闷人天气，弄得身上淌汗，头也发晕，辨不清车走到那儿了。这时我忽然听到一个响亮的女孩子的说话声：“同志们，请扶好，车子要往西拐了。”我赶紧抓住扶手，身子随车向东弯了一下，转过去了，我心里想：“这个售票员真不错，亏她喊了喊，不然，准摔倒在别人身上了。”到站了，只见一个穿着白上身、年岁不大的女孩子手里抱着个孩子，正往车上走，一面走还一面嚷着：“同志们请让个座”，她把孩子放好，马上又下去扶了个老太太上来。
    汽车又动了，人那么挤，我看见她一会儿在这一处，一会儿又到那一处了，不知她用的是什么法儿，能在人缝中钻来钻去，要叫我看，简直是一点动不得。
    没一会，她已把几十张票统统卖完了，她站在车门口说：“为了乘客方便，我把首末车和行车的时间介绍一下……
    刚上车的时候，我确实有点担心，乘客那么多，上上下下要耽搁多少时间，车子准不能按钟点行走，所以走一会，我就看看表，现在看车子走得和她说的一丝儿不差，我放心了。
    她看见一个小娃娃在妈妈的怀里睡着了，就走过去关心地说：“你快下车了，摇醒你的孩子吧，不然下车会着凉的。”她又对另一个乘客说：“你座前的这位大娘刚从乡里来，不认识道儿，她和你是同道，下车请关照关照。”
    什么样的思想什么样的力量支持着她这样作？我决定去找她谈谈。
    “有什么好谈的呢？”这位名叫白淑兰的姑娘听了说：“我们北京市公共汽车所有的售票员都是这样作的，大家都作过乘客，谁不知道乘客的心情。”
    “坐车的人那一个不是有急事要办？”白淑兰说：“当我卖票时，我心里就想：这个人也许是到建筑工地上去工作，那个人可能是去机关办事，另一个大概是去工厂开什么重要的会，再一个一定是去找自己的亲人……我要是卖票卖得慢了点，他们去晚了，说不定就会把一件重要的事耽搁了。这样一想我的干劲就来了。”
