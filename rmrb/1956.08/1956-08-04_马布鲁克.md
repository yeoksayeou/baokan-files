    "Mabrouk"
    Ai Qing
    According to a Reuters dispatch on July 26th: Egyptian President Nasser announced tonight the nationalization of the Suez Canal. ... When Cairo Radio broadcast President Nasser's announcement, Egyptians in Cairo cheered, jumped, kissed each other, and said "Mabrouk" (congratulations) to each other. I have passed through Suez twice, and each time my heart was filled with sorrow—the entire canal was guarded by others, imperialism held Egypt's throat; Egypt was exploited to the point of utter poverty, with unemployed people and beggars everywhere; under those low eaves, everyone was skin and bones; foreign ships were docked at sea, foreign gentlemen and ladies smiled joyfully, and countless Egyptians floated by the ships, begging for francs and pennies to be thrown into the water... This is the past, this is an unpleasant memory that has remained in my heart for more than twenty years, and every time I think of Egypt, it always makes my heart ache. Now the Egyptian people have roared, and the humiliated Suez has gained freedom! The banner of liberation is planted on the canal's buildings, and the enslaved nation has raised its head! Listen, the storm emanating from Cairo, how proud the sound is! Both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea have stirred up huge waves... Look, the sun rising from the East, with incomparably beautiful light, radiating across the vast desert, is shining on both banks of the Nile... Mabrouk! Mabrouk! 600 million people pay tribute to you! May you be fearless and move forward bravely, with the people of the whole world as your backing!

    “马布鲁克”
    艾青
    据路透社七月二十六日电：埃及总统纳赛尔今晚宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有。……当开罗电台广播纳赛尔总统的宣告时，开罗的埃及人欢呼、跳跃互相吻抱和互相“马布鲁克”（道贺）。我曾经两次路过苏彝士，每次心里都充满了忧愁——整条运河都被人家把守，帝国主义扼住了埃及的咽喉；埃及被搜刮得很穷很穷，到处都是失业者和乞丐，在那些低矮的屋檐下，一个个都是骨瘦如柴；外国轮船停泊在海上，外国的绅士和太太喜笑颜开，无数的埃及人浮游在船边，乞求着法郎和便士投下水来……这是往事，这是不愉快的记忆，在我的心里留了二十多年，每次当我想起埃及的时候，总是使我的心要感到辛酸。如今埃及人民发出了怒吼，屈辱的苏彝士得到了自由！解放的旗帜插上运河的建筑，被奴役的民族抬起了头！听啊，从开罗发出的风暴，声音显得多么骄傲！无论地中海和红海，都已激起了万丈波涛……看啊，从东方升起的太阳，带着无比美丽的光芒，辐射过辽阔的沙漠，正在尼罗河的两岸照耀……马布鲁克！马布鲁克！六万万人向你们致敬！愿你们无所畏惧，勇往直前，全世界的人民都是你们的后盾！
