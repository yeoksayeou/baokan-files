Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Ministry of Higher Education invited presidents and provosts from fifty-six universities to hold a symposium in Beijing starting on the 1st.

　　The main content of this symposium is to study how to correctly implement the principles of "learning from Soviet experience and combining it with Chinese reality" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in teaching reform, so as to improve teaching work, reduce students' excessive burden, cultivate students' ability to work independently, and ensure the quantity and quality of talent training.

　　At the symposium on the 1st, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of Higher Education, introduced the main situation of the current teaching work in higher education. Zeng Zhaolun said that the achievements of higher education reform in the past few years have been great. This is inseparable from learning from the Soviet Union. The main shortcomings in the current teaching work are: some of the regulations, teaching plans, and teaching syllabuses formulated by the Ministry of Higher Education overemphasize uniformity, and the implementation steps are also somewhat rushed; some teaching plans and teaching syllabuses have excessively high requirements, and they do not sufficiently consider the actual conditions and unbalanced development of various schools, lacking the necessary flexibility. In some reforms of teaching methods and organizational systems, too much attention has been paid to learning from the Soviet Union in form; the understanding of its spiritual essence is insufficient; some of the things that are effective in the Soviet Union but are not yet sufficiently conditioned in our country have not well considered China's actual conditions, and often require reaching or approaching the current standards of the Soviet Union; some have an insufficient understanding of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that there are deviations in implementation and the desired effect cannot be achieved. He asked the representatives attending the meeting to study and come up with suggestions for improvement based on the above situation.

　　The symposium will last for two weeks.

    高等教育部邀请高等学校校长和教务长座谈
    研究教学改革工作的问题
    新华社2日讯　高等教育部邀请五十六所高等学校的校长和教务长，从一日起在北京举行座谈会。
    这次座谈会的主要内容是研究如何在教学改革中正确贯彻“学习苏联经验、结合中国实际”和“百家争鸣”的方针，以改进教学工作，减轻学生过重负担，培养学生独立工作能力，保证培养人材的数量和质量。
    在一日的座谈会上，高等教育部副部长曾昭抡介绍了目前高等教育教学工作中的主要情况。曾昭抡说，几年来，高等教育改革的成绩是很大的。这是和学习苏联分不开的。目前在教学工作中的主要缺点是：高等教育部所订的有些规章制度和教学计划、教学大纲过分强调统一性，执行步骤也有些偏急；有些教学计划和教学大纲要求偏高，对各校实际条件和发展不平衡等情况考虑不够，缺乏必要的灵活性。在有些教学方法、组织制度方面的改革，过多地注意在形式上学习苏联；体会其精神实质不够；有的是苏联行之有效而我国目前条件还不够的，没有很好考虑我国实际条件，往往要求达到或接近苏联目前的标准；有的是对苏联的先进经验了解不够正确，以致执行时有偏差，不能达到应有的效果。他要求到会代表就以上情况研究出改进的意见。
    座谈会将举行两星期。
