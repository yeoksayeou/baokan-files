Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: According to a Yugoslav News Agency report on August 11th: Yugoslav President Tito issued a statement regarding the Yugoslav government's attitude towards the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and the upcoming London Conference.

    Tito said: First, I would like to point out that, according to the 1888 Convention, our country is the legal successor to the maritime rights of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. But even without considering this point, Yugoslavia is still one of the Mediterranean maritime nations and therefore has a direct interest in the issue of navigation on the Suez Canal.

    Therefore, we are very surprised that the three countries convening the London Conference have completely ignored our country's interests in this regard and its right to participate in any conference that may examine the issue of navigation on the Suez Canal. This does not seem to be accidental, because other countries with similar interests have not been invited to participate in this conference, which casts a shadow on the conference's motives, purposes, and effectiveness.

    This one-sided attitude towards the problem and the haste shown by the conveners of the conference are particularly regrettable, because they have also adopted certain economic measures and threatened to use force against Egypt. All of this is happening in a situation that marks a gradual relaxation of international tensions. This has already caused a change in the international atmosphere. This is not only related to the three countries convening the conference, but also to the entire world related to the defense of peace. This action is bound to be a blow to the United Nations and all past efforts aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening world peace.

    As for the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, we believe that no one can refute the right of a sovereign country to nationalize anything on its own territory if it believes that doing so is beneficial to the people and national sovereignty. In this matter, it is clear that what is actually involved is an Egyptian company subject to Egyptian law and jurisdiction. We believe that maintaining the canal, keeping it functioning normally, and managing and protecting it are integral parts of Egypt's sovereign rights. Of course, the general principle of freedom of navigation, especially the principle of free navigation on the Suez Canal without any discrimination, is a matter of concern to the entire world; moreover, any country through whose territory such an important international waterway passes must fulfill its corresponding international obligations. The Egyptian government has already declared its willingness to respect these obligations. Therefore, it is wrong to forcibly attach the stigma of Egypt failing to fulfill its obligations to Egypt, a sovereign country.

    Tito said, finally, I want to state that we believe that the way the London Conference was convened and the atmosphere of threatened use of force make it impossible for Egypt and other relevant countries to have confidence in the conference. It should be emphasized that no conference can discuss Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, and what this right includes (including managing and guaranteeing freedom of navigation through the canal). International conferences can only discuss the conditions for implementing the principle of free navigation, and in doing so, Egypt must participate in the discussions on an equal footing, and Egypt cannot be forced to accept any decision.

### 铁托总统声明  外国无权干涉埃及收回运河  伦敦会议不应排斥南斯拉夫和其他一些国家

    铁托总统声明
    外国无权干涉埃及收回运河
    伦敦会议不应排斥南斯拉夫和其他一些国家
    新华社12日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社十一日报道：南斯拉夫总统铁托就南斯拉夫政府对于苏彝士运河公司国有化和即将举行的伦敦会议所持的态度问题发表了声明。
    铁托说：首先，我愿意指出，根据1888年公约，我们国家是前奥匈帝国海上权利的合法继承人。但是即使不把这一点考虑在内，南斯拉夫也还是地中海的海运国家之一，因此在关于苏彝士运河的航行问题上有着直接关系。
    因此，我们感到非常惊奇的是，召集伦敦会议的三国完全忽视了我们国家在这方面的利益和它参加任何可能检查苏彝士运河航行问题的会议的权利。这并不似乎是偶然的，因为其他有类似利益的国家也没有被邀请参加这个会议，这样一来就给会议的动机、目的和功效投下了暗影。
    对问题的这种片面态度以及会议召集者所表现的急急忙忙的样子，是尤其令人遗憾的。因为他们同时还采用了某种经济措施并且扬言要对埃及使用武力。这一切都发生在标志着国际紧张局势逐渐缓和的这样一个局势中。这已经造成了国际气氛的改变。这不仅关系到召集会议的三国，而且还关系到同保卫和平有关的整个世界。这一行动对于联合国和过去一切旨在实现缓和国际紧张局势和加强世界和平的努力，都必然意味着是一个打击。
    至于把苏彝士运河公司收归国有一事，我们认为没有人能够驳斥一个主权国家把它自己领土上的任何东西收归国有的权利，如果它认为这样做是对人民和国家主权有利的话。在这件事上，显然所实际牵涉到的是一个受埃及的法律和管辖权的约束的埃及公司。我们认为，保养运河、保持运河的正常作用以及管理和保卫运河，是埃及主权权利的组成部分。当然，一般的航行自由原则，特别是不受任何歧视地在苏彝士运河上自由航行的原则，是整个世界所关切的问题；而且，凡是领土上有这样一种重要的国际水道通过的国家，都一定不会不负起相应的国际义务的。埃及政府已经宣称愿意尊重这种义务。因此，硬把所谓埃及将不履行它的义务的污名加在埃及这样一个主权国家的身上是不对的。
    铁托说，最后，我要说明，我们认为召开伦敦会议的方式以及扬言要使用武力的气氛，使得埃及和其他有关国家不能够对会议产生信心。应当强调指出，没有任何会议能够讨论埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的权利，以及这种权利所包含的东西（包括管理和保证通过运河的航行自由）。国际会议只能够讨论实施自由航行的原则的条件，而且在这样作的时候一定要有埃及在平等的基础上参加讨论，而不能够强迫埃及接受任何决定。
