One of the greatest features of the First National Music Week was the concentrated performance of representative excellent works by some famous musicians since the May Fourth Movement.

Although the era in which these works were produced has passed, today, when we listen to them, their artistic charm and their sounds still excite us and strongly infect us. From these works, we can feel the great spiritual strength of the Chinese people struggling for national liberation and a happy life, as well as the arduous years and fighting course the Chinese people have experienced in the past.

From these works, we can also relive the history of the development of Chinese music and art over the past thirty years. At the same time, it also makes us deeply appreciate the hard work of the predecessors in creating new national music and absorbing world music culture, as well as the rich fruits of their musical creation.

Among these works, those with profound ideological content and most representative of the voice of the Chinese people are of course the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai. We can not only hear the well-known works of these two outstanding composers, but also hear works that have never been performed before. From Nie Er's "New Woman," "Graduation Song," "The Road Song," and "Dock Workers' Song," we can appreciate his keen sense of real life and his firm confidence in the revolutionary cause of the working class. Nie Er's talent was multifaceted. From his "Village Girl Outside the Great Wall," "The Newspaper Boy," "Spring Dawn at Emerald Lake," and "Golden Snake Dance," we can see that he was not only good at writing militant songs full of the spirit of the times, but also at writing beautiful, lyrical, and moving music. The clear themes, melodies with a strong national flavor, fresh and poetic conception, and vivid musical images expressed in these songs all deeply move us. Each of his songs has a different style and different expressive techniques. It is difficult for us to find two works with completely identical styles and artistic expressions in all his music. Xian Xinghai, due to his different conditions from Nie Er and the longer duration of his artistic activities, left behind a larger number of works. This time, we can hear his most popular songs, such as "Yellow River Cantata," "On the Taihang Mountains," "Midnight Song," "March of the Manchurian Prisoners," and "Sour Jujube Thorns." More valuable is that we can hear his two large-scale instrumental works that have never been performed, "First Symphony" ("National Liberation Symphony") and "Man Jiang Hong Suite." The "First Symphony" is a magnificent epic depicting the long and arduous revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. When we hear this work, we are deeply shaken by its enormous artistic power. Based on Chinese folk music materials, the composer used European traditional forms and techniques to shape the heroic image of the Chinese people who advanced wave upon wave, fighting bravely. In the "Man Jiang Hong Suite," we feel the immortal image of the loyal and unyielding national heroes in Chinese history praised by the composer. The composer made a good artistic processing of this ancient tune with orchestral techniques, greatly enriching its expressiveness; at the same time, it also profoundly reflects the composer's grand conception. This can be used as an example for us to learn how to adapt classical and folk music into orchestral music. We can definitely say that the study and research of Xian Xinghai's legacy cannot ignore his excellent instrumental works.

In terms of works reflecting the great struggle of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism, we had many excellent song writers in the past, leaving a very rich and precious legacy. Performing these works today is of great practical significance. Because they reflect the Chinese people's perseverance and optimism in that struggle, they served as the horn of progress to inspire the broad masses of people in the past, and today they can still inspire our enthusiasm to participate in socialist construction. Like Mai Xin's "March of the Big Swords," Zhang Shu's "Hong Bo Song," Ren Guang's "Fight Back to Our Old Home," and Zhang Hanhui's "Songhua River" performed this time, they are all representative works. Today, hearing these songs again can still evoke the noblest feelings in our hearts. Especially for those who have personally experienced the War of Resistance Against Japan, the feelings are even deeper. If these excellent songs are accompanied by accompaniment and made them regular performance programs for future concerts, it is a very meaningful work.

However, we cannot ignore other composers of different schools who have contributed to the Chinese people and to the Chinese music industry. They have made many contributions in developing music education and introducing world music culture. Some of their works also reflect the demands and aspirations of the people to varying degrees and express a certain spirit of the times. This music week performed many good works in this regard. We can hear the excellent works of Xiao Youmei, Huang Zi, Zhao Yuanren, Liu Tianhua, Zheng Zhisheng, and Li Jinhui. Their works have different characteristics, different styles, and different artistic attainments, which are worthy of our serious study. Among them, Xiao Youmei and Huang Zi have made relatively outstanding contributions to the Chinese music industry. Xiao Youmei was the earliest music educator in China who systematically introduced Western European music theory to China, and also the earliest old composer who used European musical forms to create. His solo song "Question," performed this time, although only a song, can also show his artistic talent and his attempt to express the enlightenment democratic ideological tendency at that time. Another person who made great contributions to music education and creation was Huang Zi. He received strict and complete foreign music education, and at the same time had a deep knowledge of Chinese national music, and made great efforts in pursuing national style. He wrote many vocal works, many of which were welcomed by the masses. Especially when the Japanese imperialist aggression was deepening, he was inspired by the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, and the themes, content, and style of his works underwent great changes. He attempted to use large-scale vocal works to express the patriotic demands of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese struggle. This is the earliest attempt in modern Chinese music history. From the "Anti-Enemy Song" and "The Flag is Flying" heard this time, we can feel the composer's intention and the voice of the people at that time reflected in the works. Judging from the depth of the musical image, the excitement of the tone, the boldness of the momentum, the maturity of the skills, and the completeness of the form of these two works, they can be called excellent works. In addition, we can also hear his "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" and "Nostalgia" (orchestral music). The former is a cantata often performed in past concerts. This work has a distinct national color, a novel and original style, and a dramatic conception; in terms of the content it seeks to express, the composer has completed the task. At present, we have very few large-scale vocal works with ancient history as the theme; it can also be said that no one has made such achievements so far. I think this is a musical narrative poem that uses the historical facts of the "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" to describe a love tragedy. According to this understanding, then the composer has completed the task in terms of musical art expression quite well. However, his "Nostalgia" is much worse than the previous works; because its musical image is blurred, and the musical language lacks national characteristics.

In this performance, it is also worth mentioning Li Jinhui's "Little Painter". There is an obvious difference between Li Jinhui's early works and his later works. His early works such as "Moonlit Night", "Sparrow and Child", and "Poor Qiu Xiang" were all popular. Among them, "Little Painter" has more realistic content. This children's opera reflects the kind of unreasonable education imposed on children in the old era that violated their physical and mental development. The composer satirized stubborn and pedantic private school teachers and parents, and shaped a lovely children's image who resisted the old feudal education. This performance was also warmly welcomed by the audience.

Of course, the excellent works since the May Fourth Movement are not limited to these. Many works by composers who are still alive today have not been introduced. It can be said that this is just a beginning to promote and inherit the excellent musical traditions since the May Fourth Movement, and there is still much work waiting for us to do.

In short, many outstanding works of the past, no matter how different their schools, styles, and personalities are, are treasures in our music treasure house. Our musicians have the responsibility to make their brilliance more brilliant and more gorgeous, so that the broad masses of people can recognize their value through performances and introductions, and truly make them a musical wealth for the whole people.

    五四以来音乐艺术的光辉
    杨琦
    第一届全国音乐周最大的特色之一，就是集中地演出了五四以来部分著名音乐家的一些具有代表性的优秀作品。
    产生这些作品的时代虽然过去了；但是，今天听起来，它们的艺术魅力，它们的音响，仍然使我们心情激动，使我们受到强烈的感染。从这些作品中，我们能感觉到中国人民为民族解放、为幸福生活而斗争的伟大精神力量和中国人民过去所经历的艰苦岁月和战斗的历程。
    从这些作品中，还可以重温一遍三十年来中国音乐艺术发展的历史。同时，也使我们深切地体会到，前驱者们在创立新的民族音乐和吸取世界音乐文化方面的辛勤劳绩，以及在音乐创作上的丰盛成果。
    在这些作品中，具有深刻思想内容，最能代表中国人民心声的当然是聂耳、星海的作品。我们不但能听到这两位杰出的作曲家的为群众熟知的作品，同时也能听到过去未曾演出过的作品。从聂耳的“新女性”、“毕业歌”、“大路歌”、“码头工人歌”里，我们能够体会到他对于现实生活的敏锐感觉，对于工人阶级革命事业的坚强信心。聂耳的才能是多方面的。从他的“塞外村女”、“卖报歌”、“翠湖春晓”、“金蛇狂舞”就可以看出，他不但善于写富有时代精神的战斗性的歌曲，也能写优美抒情娓娓动听的乐曲。这几个曲子所表现出的明朗的主题，有浓厚民族色彩的旋律、清新的诗意的构思、鲜明的音乐形象，都使我们深受感动。他的每一个曲子都有不同的风格和不同的表现手法，我们很难在他的所有乐曲中找出两个风格和艺术表现完全相同的东西来。而星海由于他的条件和聂耳不同，又由于他艺术活动的时间比较长，所以留下的作品数量比较多。这次，我们可以听到他的最受人民欢迎的歌曲“黄河大合唱”、“在太行山上”、“夜半歌声”、“满洲囚徒进行曲”、“酸枣刺”等。更可贵的是我们能听到他的两部从未演出过的大型器乐作品“第一交响乐”（“民族解放交响乐”）和“满江红组曲”。“第一交响乐”是一部描写中国人民在中国共产党领导下进行长期艰苦革命斗争的宏伟的史诗。我们听到这部作品的时候，深深为它那巨大的艺术力量所震动。作曲家在中国民间音乐材料的基础上，运用了欧洲的传统形式和手法，塑造了中国人民前仆后继、英勇战斗的英雄形象。在“满江红组曲”中，我们感受到作曲家所歌颂的中国历史上忠诚不屈的民族英雄的不朽形象。作曲家用管弦乐手法对这支古曲作了很好的艺术加工，大大丰富了它的表现力；同时，也深刻地体现了作曲家的宏大构思。这可以作为我们学习把古典和民间乐曲改编为管弦乐的范例。我们可以肯定地说，学习和研究星海的遗产绝不能忽略他的优秀的器乐作品。
    在以反映中国人民反抗日本帝国主义的伟大斗争为题材的作品方面，我们过去有许多优秀的歌曲作家，留下了一大笔非常丰富而珍贵的遗产。这些作品在今天来演出，是有很大现实意义的。因为，它们反映了中国人民在那个斗争中的坚毅乐观的精神，它们过去作为前进的号声鼓舞了广大的人民群众，今天仍然能够鼓舞我们参加社会主义建设的热情。像这次演出的麦新的“大刀进行曲”、张曙的“洪波曲”、任光的“打回老家去”、张寒晖的“松花江上”，都是具有代表性的作品。今天，重新听到这些歌曲，仍能在我们内心深处唤起最崇高的感情。特别对亲身经历过抗日战争的人来说，感触更为深切。像这些优秀的歌曲，如果配上伴奏，使它们成为今后音乐会的经常演出节目，是一件很有意义的工作。
    但是，我们也不可以忽视另外一些对中国人民、对中国音乐事业有过贡献的不同流派的作曲家。他们曾经在发展音乐教育事业，介绍世界音乐文化等方面有过很多贡献。他们的部分作品也在不同程度上反映了人民的要求和愿望，表现了一定的时代精神。这次音乐周演出了不少这方面的好的作品。我们可以听到萧友梅、黄自、赵元任、刘天华、郑志声、黎锦晖等人的优秀作品。他们的作品有着不同的特点、不同的风格和不同的艺术造诣，值得我们认真地学习。其中对中国音乐事业有着比较突出的贡献的是萧友梅和黄自。萧友梅是我国最早的系统地介绍西欧音乐理论到中国来的音乐教育家，也是最早采用欧洲音乐形式进行创作的老作曲家。这次演出的他的独唱歌曲“问”，虽然仅仅是一首歌曲，但也能看出他的艺术才能和他企图表达的当时启蒙的民主思想倾向。另一位在音乐教育和创作上贡献较大的是黄自。他受到严格而完整的外国音乐教育，同时对中国民族音乐也有深厚的知识，在追求民族风格方面曾作了很大的努力。他写了不少声乐作品，有许多受到了群众的欢迎。特别在日本帝国主义侵略日益加深的时候，他受到中国人民英勇斗争的启发，作品的题材、内容、风格都起了很大的变化。他企图用大型声乐作品，来表达中国人民反日斗争的爱国主义要求。这是我国近代音乐历史上最早的尝试。从这次所听到的“抗敌歌”、“旗正飘飘”中，我们能够感觉出作曲家的意图和作品所体现出的当时的人民的呼声。就这两个作品的音乐形象的深度，音调的激昂，气势的豪壮，技巧的成熟，形式的完整来看，是可以称为优秀作品的。另外，我们还能听到他的“长恨歌”和“怀旧”（管弦乐），前者是过去音乐会中常常演出的一部清唱剧。这部作品具有鲜明的民族色彩，新颖的独创风格，戏剧性的构思；从它所要求表现的内容来说，作曲家是完成了任务的。目前，我们以古代历史为题材的大型声乐作品还很少；也可以说，到现在还没有人作出这样的成绩。我认为这是一部借“长恨歌”这段史实来描写爱情悲剧的音乐叙事诗。依照这样的理解，那末作曲家在音乐艺术表现方面的任务是相当好地完成了的。但是，他的“怀旧”比起前面几个作品来就差多了；因为它的音乐形象模糊，音乐语言缺乏民族特征。
    在这一次演出中，值得提出来的还有黎锦晖的“小小画家”。黎锦晖早期的作品和他后期的作品显然是有区别的。他早期的作品如“月明之夜”，“麻雀与小孩”“可怜的秋香”等都曾获得人们的喜爱。其中“小小画家”更较有现实内容。这部儿童歌剧，反映了旧时代加于儿童身上的那种不合理的、违反儿童身心发展的教育。作曲家讽刺了顽固迂腐的私塾老师和家长，塑造了一个反抗旧式封建教育的可爱的儿童形象。这次演出，也受到了听众的热烈欢迎。
    当然，五四以来的优秀作品不仅仅是这一些，有很多今天还健在的作曲家的作品都还没有加以介绍。可以说，这不过是发扬和继承五四以来优秀音乐传统的一个开端，还有许多工作等待我们来做。
    总之，过去的许多杰出的作品，不管它的流派、风格、个性怎样千差万别，都是我们音乐宝库中的珍宝。我们的音乐工作者有责任使它们的光彩愈发灿烂、愈发绚丽，让广大人民通过演出介绍认识到它们的价值，真正使它们变成为全民的音乐财富。
