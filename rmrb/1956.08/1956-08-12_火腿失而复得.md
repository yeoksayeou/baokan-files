　　Ham Recovered
　　Fang Wen

　　Although this happened a long time ago, it remains unforgettable to me.

　　At the end of last year, I went from Ji'an to Nanchang for a meeting. The camphor wood chests from Ji'an are very famous and sell well throughout the country; and the ham in Jiangxi Province is also top quality. At the request of a friend, I took a camphor wood chest and a ham to Nanchang. Because I was familiar with the Camphor Wood Chest Cooperative, for convenience, the day before I left, I put the ham in the camphor wood chest and asked the Camphor Wood Chest Cooperative to send it to the bus station to check as luggage. Unexpectedly, when I opened the chest in Nanchang, the ham was gone.

　　Did the Camphor Wood Chest Cooperative take the ham out and then forget to put it back in? I thought about it, and it didn't seem likely. The Camphor Wood Chest Cooperative had no need to open the chest. I thought and thought, but couldn't figure it out.

　　About half a month later, I returned to Ji'an from Nanchang. At the station, I heard that an unclaimed ham was being advertised. My heart couldn't help but skip a beat. Could it be the ham that I had lost? I went to the stationmaster:

　　"I heard there's a ham being advertised here?"

　　"Yes? Is it yours? How heavy is it? What are its characteristics?"

　　"Seven catties and four ounces, with a piece of the trotter chopped off."

　　"Ah!" The stationmaster suddenly exclaimed. "We've finally found the owner. You were going to Nanchang from here about two weeks ago, weren't you?"

　　I was so happy at this point that I could only nod. I never thought I'd find the ham. But I still didn't understand why the ham was left at the station. I asked the stationmaster, and this is what happened:

　　The day I went to Nanchang with the camphor wood chest, another passenger also had a camphor wood chest. The camphor wood chests were exactly the same, except one had ham in it and the other didn't. When they got off the bus, they accidentally took each other's. After the passenger arrived at his destination in Nanchang, he found that he had an extra ham, so he quickly called the Nanchang bus station and then personally delivered it to the bus station. The Nanchang bus station had no way to find the owner, so they made a long-distance call to the Ji'an bus station. The Ji'an bus station had been advertising it for nearly half a month.

　　I asked someone to take the ham to the friend who had asked me to buy it. From this, I gained the following feeling: How lovable our country is! In the past, people used "no one picks up lost articles" to praise the stability of society and the noble moral qualities of the people. Now, our country is more than just a place where no one picks up lost articles!

    火腿失而复得
    方文
    这虽是很久以前的事情，但它却使我久久不能忘怀。
    去年底，我从吉安到南昌开会。吉安的樟木箱是很有名的，畅销全国各地；火腿在江西省来说也是上品。受朋友之托，我带了一只樟木箱、一只火腿上南昌。因为和樟木箱合作社熟悉的关系，为了方便，临行前一天我就把火腿装在樟木箱里，托樟木箱合作社代送汽车站打行李票。万想不到，到了南昌打开箱子时，火腿却不见了。
    是樟木箱合作社把火腿拿出来了后来忘记放进去？想了想，不像，樟木箱合作社没有必要开箱子。左想右想，想不出个名堂。
    过了半个来月，我又从南昌回到吉安。在车站上，我听到有一无主的火腿正在招领。心中不免一动，莫非是自己不见了的那只火腿？便去找站长：
    “听说这里有只火腿招领？”
    “是呀？是你的吗？多重？有什么特征？”
    “七斤四两，砍了一块脚爪。”
    “哎呀！”站长这时突然叫起来了。“这一下总算找到主了。你是前半个月由这上南昌去的，是不是？”
    我这时高兴得只知道点头。我怎样也想不到还能找到这火腿。但我还是不明白火腿为什么会丢在车站上。又问站长，原来是这样：
    我那天上南昌是带樟木箱，另一个旅客也带了樟木箱。樟木箱完全一个样，只是一个装了火腿，一个没装火腿，下车时彼此拿错了。那个旅客到南昌目的地后，发现多了一只火腿，忙打电话告诉南昌汽车站，后又亲自把它送到汽车站。南昌汽车站没有办法找失主，就打长途电话给吉安汽车站。吉安汽车站招领已近半个月了。
    我把火腿托人带给了托买的朋友。由此我得到这样一个感受：我们的国家多可爱啊！古人曾经用路不拾遗歌颂社会的安定和人们崇高的道德品质，现在我们的国家又何止是路不拾遗呢！
