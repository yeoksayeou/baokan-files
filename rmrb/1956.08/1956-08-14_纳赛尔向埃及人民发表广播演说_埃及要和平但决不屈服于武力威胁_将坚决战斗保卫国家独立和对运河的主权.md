Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Cairo News: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser delivered a radio address to the Egyptian people on August 12th after holding a press conference. He said, "Egypt will forever strive for peaceful solutions to international problems, but we are unwilling to be under the yoke of any country."

    **Nationalizing the Canal is Egypt's Legitimate Right**

    In his speech, Nasser reiterated that nationalizing the International Suez Canal Company was Egypt's legitimate right. He pointed out, we have not seized the Suez Canal. We have merely nationalized the Canal Company. This is our legitimate right. We do not wish to be under the influence of anyone. We are an independent and autonomous country defending our own rights.

    He said that British newspapers say Gamal Abdel Nasser has seized the canal. How can I seize something that belongs to us, to Egypt? Three major powers, which claim to be the leaders of the free world and the defenders of the freedom and sovereignty of all nations, have begun to exert tremendous pressure on the nation of Egypt, simply to prevent us from restoring our rights in the Suez Canal. They intend to starve the Egyptian people and humiliate us, simply to suit their own purposes. It is quite astonishing that such actions should come from those who insist that they are the defenders of world freedom.

    President Nasser said: "This is not a matter of the Suez Canal, but a matter for all small countries fighting against imperialism and defending their independence."

    Nasser's speech, delivered in Arabic, pointed out that the West's reaction to Egypt's nationalization of the Canal Company amounted to a clamor.

    He asked, "What exactly is this clamor that is taking place abroad?" He said that what we understand is that Britain owns 44% of the shares and receives profits amounting to five or six million pounds sterling annually.

    "So is the clamor arising because Britain is losing these five or six million pounds sterling?" Nasser said, no, it is because another sphere of influence is being eliminated.

    He said, "We cannot agree to become anyone's sphere of influence under any name or under any company."

    **Economic Sanctions by the Three Powers Cannot Force Egypt to Surrender**

    Nasser said that the economic sanctions implemented by the three major powers can never force Egypt to surrender.

    He pointed out, "The economic pressure exerted on us by the three powers may affect us, but it will not starve us. We have prepared for it and will continue to fight against it."

    He said that we had anticipated this pressure. That is why we have done our best to arrange our own affairs and finances in order to be prepared for any emergency and to prevent any one or more countries from forcing us to accept their conditions. We have done our best to cooperate with all countries in the world. We have always relied on Britain and the Bank of England in our transactions and commerce, but at the same time, we are striving to liberate ourselves.

    **Egypt's Refusal to Attend the London Conference is Justified**

    Nasser explained in a calm and peaceful tone why he refused the invitation to attend the London Conference. He said: "What the three powers are concerned about is merely controlling the free world, establishing spheres of influence, and subjugating other countries. In this way, their intentions are clearly shown to the truly free world. Therefore, we refuse to attend the London Conference today. I was originally prepared to go to London, but given what we understand to be the true intentions of the three major powers, what use is there in attending this conference? Egypt has always been willing to peacefully resolve all international problems in a manner that conforms to the interests of all countries and world peace, but what are these countries truly seeking, peace or world hegemony?"

    Nasser asked, "Does France truly desire peace? If so, then why does it not resolve the Algerian question and end the daily massacres taking place in Algeria?

      "What is Britain truly seeking, peace or safeguarding Britain's position in the world? If they still wish to be the masters of the Suez Canal region, then how do they understand the matter of withdrawing from there?"

    He accused Britain of adopting "nineteenth-century methods." He also said that Egypt wants peace, but it will never succumb to any aggression, economic or military threats.

    He pointed out that the West's demand for the internationalization of the canal is merely collective imperialism under the guise of an international agreement.

    **Egypt Will Maintain Complete Freedom of the Suez Canal**

    Nasser repeatedly emphasized that Egypt will maintain complete freedom of this waterway. He pointed out that the hundreds of ships that have passed through the canal from the day of the company's nationalization until today prove that "we have done our best to maintain the freedom of the canal, and we will continue to do so, because this is very important for the world economy and world trade."

    Nasser said in his radio address that World Bank President Eugene Black had expressed his willingness to lend Egypt one billion US dollars if Egypt agreed to extend the Canal Company's lease in 1968.

    Nasser said that Eugene Black made this suggestion at a time when Egypt was facing an international conspiracy aimed at extending control over the canal.

    **Arab Nations Fully Support Egypt's Struggle**

    Nasser praised the national aspirations of the Arab world and Arab governments, because they wholeheartedly support Egypt's national movement. He said, "Arab nationalism has awakened and is ready to defend its own rights."

    Nasser said that the Arabs are not afraid of the "military preparations" being carried out by the West. He said that the people of the Arab countries are prepared to shed their last drop of blood to defend Egypt.

    Nasser also said, "We are prepared to wage total war, like the war currently being waged by the Algerian people to resist French colonialism, like the war that the heroic Vietnamese people once waged."

    He pointed out that the people of the Far East and the Middle East realize that it is not only Egypt's sovereignty that is under threat, but also their own independence and future.

    Nasser said that the people of these countries know that Egypt firmly adheres to the principles of self-determination, world peace, and the peaceful resolution of international disputes.

    Nasser cited the situation in Algeria as an example, saying that Britain and France have proven that they do not support these principles.

    Nasser concluded by saying, "If necessary, we will fight to the death to defend our independence, our sovereignty over the canal, and the rights of our people to life and peaceful labor."

    纳赛尔向埃及人民发表广播演说
    埃及要和平但决不屈服于武力威胁
    将坚决战斗保卫国家独立和对运河的主权
    新华社13日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔八月十二日在举行记者招待会以后向埃及人民发表了广播演说。他说，“埃及将要永远争取和平解决国际问题，可是，我们不愿意处于任何国家的枷锁之下”。
    把运河收归国有是埃及的正当权利
    纳赛尔在演说中重申把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有是埃及的合法权利。他指出，我们并没有霸占苏彝士运河。我们仅仅是把运河公司收归国有。这是我们的正当权利。我们不希望处在任何人的影响之下。我们是保卫着自己权利的独立自主国家。
    他说，英国报纸说加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔霸占了运河。我怎么能够霸占本来属于我们、属于埃及的东西呢？自命为自由世界的领导者以及各国人民的自由和主权的捍卫者的三个大国，开始对埃及国家施加强大的压力，仅仅是为了阻止我们恢复我们在苏彝士运河的权利。它们打算饿死埃及人民，使我们受屈辱，仅仅是为了适合它们自己的目的。这种做法竟然出自那些硬说自己是世界自由的保卫者的人们，这是十分令人惊异的。
    纳赛尔总统说：“这不是一个苏彝士运河的问题，而是为反对帝国主义、保卫自己的独立而斗争的一切小国的问题。”
    纳赛尔用阿拉伯语发表的演说指出，西方对埃及把运河公司收归国有的反应等于是一场叫嚣。
    他问，“在国外发生的这种叫嚣究竟是什么呢？”他说，我们所理解的是，英国拥有44％的股票，它每年得到数达五六百万英镑的利润。
    “所以引起叫嚣是因为英国丧失了这五六百万的英镑吗？”纳赛尔说，不是的，这是由于另一个势力痕迹正在被消除。
    他说，“我们不能同意在任何名义或者在任何公司之下成为任何人的一个势力地区”。
    三国经济制裁不能迫使埃及投降
    纳赛尔说，三大国实行的经济制裁决不能迫使埃及投降。
    他指出，“三国对我们所施加的经济压力，可能使我们受到影响，可是不会使我们饿死。我们已经对它有所准备，也将要继续对它进行斗争。”
    他说，我们原来就预料到这种压力。所以我们才尽力安排我们自己的事务和财政，以便做好准备来对付任何紧急情况，并且防止任何一国或者更多的国家强迫我们接受它们的条件。我们已经尽力同全世界所有国家合作。我们在我们的交易和商业中一直依靠英国和英格兰银行，但是同时也争取解放我们自己。
    埃及拒绝参加伦敦会议合乎道理
    纳赛尔用安静而平和的语调解释了他为什么拒绝关于参加伦敦会议的邀请。他说：“三国所关心的，仅仅是控制自由世界，建立势力范围和使其他国家屈从罢了。这样，它们的意图就清楚地向真正的自由世界表明了。因此，我们今天拒绝参加伦敦会议。我原是准备到伦敦去的，可是，从我们所了解的三大国的真正意图看来，参加这个会议究竟有什么用处呢？埃及始终愿意在符合一切国家和世界和平的利益的情况下和平地解决一切国际问题，可是这些国家所真正寻求的，到底是和平还是世界霸权呢？”
    纳赛尔问道，“法国真正希望和平吗？假如是真的，那末它又为什么不解决阿尔及利亚问题，结束每天在阿尔及利亚进行的屠杀呢？
      “英国所真正寻求的，究竟是和平还是保障英国在世界的地位呢？假如他们仍然希望作苏彝士运河地区的主人，那末，他们在对于从那里撤退一事是怎样理解的呢？”
    他指责英国采取“十九世纪的方法”。他还说，埃及要和平，但是它决不会屈服于任何侵略力量或者经济或军事威胁。
    他指出，西方关于运河国际化的要求只是在一个国际协定的幌子下的集体帝国主义而已。
    埃及将保持苏彝士运河完全自由
    纳赛尔再三强调指出，埃及将保持这条水道的完全自由。他指出，从公司国有化那天起直到今天所通过运河的数以百计的船只证明，“我们已经尽力保持运河的自由，我们将继续这样做，因为这对于世界经济和世界贸易是非常重要的”。
    纳赛尔在广播演说中说，世界银行行长尤金·布莱克曾经表示愿意贷给埃及十亿美元，如果埃及同意在1968年延长运河公司的租借期的话。
    纳赛尔说，尤金·布莱克是在埃及面临着目的在于延长对这条运河的管制时间的国际阴谋的时候提出这个建议的。
    阿拉伯各国全心支持埃及的斗争
    纳赛尔赞扬阿拉伯世界和阿拉伯各国政府的民族愿望，因为它们全心全意地支持埃及的民族运动。他说，“阿拉伯的民族主义已经觉醒，并且准备保卫它自己的权利。”
    纳赛尔说，阿拉伯人不畏惧西方正在进行的“军事准备”。他说，阿拉伯各国人民都准备流他们的最后一滴血来保卫埃及。
    纳赛尔又说，“我们准备进行总体战，像目前阿尔及利亚人民进行的抗拒法殖民主义者的、像英勇的越南人民曾经进行过的战争那样”。
    他指出，远东和中东各国人民都认识到，受到威胁的不仅是埃及的主权，而且还有他们自己的独立和前途。
    纳赛尔说，这些国家的人民都知道埃及坚决遵守自决、世界和平、和平解决国际争端的原则。
    纳赛尔引阿尔及利亚的情况为例说，英国和法国证明了它们不支持这些原则。
    纳赛尔最后说，“如果必要，我们将战斗到死来保卫我们的独立、我们对运河的主权和我国人民的生活及和平劳动的权利”。
