Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 22nd: The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee issued a statement on the 21st saying that the prohibition of the German Communist Party is directed against the interests of all German people because this action greatly increases the difficulties in unifying Germany in a peaceful and democratic way.

The statement emphasized that the victorious communist ideology can neither be "outlawed" nor prohibited or destroyed. The people of Czechoslovakia express their firm solidarity with the heroic struggle of the West German communists, and support the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to build socialism and strive for the democratic unification of Germany. Czechoslovakia will increase its vigilance, consolidate its economic strength, and strengthen its proletarian internationalist ties with the working people of West Germany and all peace-loving countries in response to the strengthening of fascist tendencies in West Germany.

    捷共中央发表声明
    支援德国共产党的英勇斗争
    据新华社布拉格22日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会二十一日发表的声明说，禁止德国共产党这一行动的锋芒是针对着德国全体人民的利益的，因为这个行动大大地加重了在按和平和民主方式统一德国方面的困难。
    声明强调说，胜利的共产主义思想是既不能够“宣布非法”，也不能够禁止或是摧毁的。捷克斯洛伐克人民对西德共产党人的英勇斗争表示坚决的声援，对于德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的努力和争取德国的民主统一表示支持。捷克斯洛伐克将提高它的警惕性、巩固它的经济力量和加强同西德劳动人民及所有争取和平的国家的劳动人民之间的无产阶级国际主义联系，以回答西德的法西斯趋向的加强。
