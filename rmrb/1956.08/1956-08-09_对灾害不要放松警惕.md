    Don't Relax Vigilance Against Disasters
    Still "Considering, Considering?"
    This year, the Zhentou Township Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, planted more than 1,300 mu of cotton in Beidu Village, most of which is fertile land. The cotton is growing well, and the co-op members are in high spirits.
    However, on July 11th, cotton bollworms were suddenly discovered, and they spread rapidly. By July 14th, almost every cotton plant had worms. According to experienced farmers, if the worms are not treated quickly, cotton production could be reduced by about half in a few days. Seeing this situation, the cooperative actively organized manpower to capture the worms, and reported to the Suburban People's Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, requesting assistance. The reply received was: consider it, think of a solution. The cooperative leaders had no choice but to request support from a certain infantry school stationed locally, and they received truly powerful help here. On July 15th and 16th (July 15th was a Sunday, and was exchanged with the Sunday of the 22nd), from the school leaders on down, all the students, staff, and some family members actively helped the farmers catch worms under the scorching sun. In two days, all the cotton fields were caught through twice, and some fields were even caught three times, saving these more than 1,300 mu of cotton from more serious losses. The co-op members were moved to tears.
    However, when the insect plague was extremely serious and rescuing the cotton was as urgent as fire, the leaders and business cadres of the city and district governments were nowhere to be seen. It is said that they were still considering!

    Where Did the Flood Control Equipment Go?
    Now is the flood season, and there is always the possibility of major floods occurring. The preparation of flood control equipment is very important. However, recently, farmers in some areas along rivers in Liaoning Province have not taken care of flood control equipment, resulting in a large amount of rot and loss, failure to distinguish between public and private, and random misappropriation. For example, the Shengli Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Hujia District, Panshan County, misappropriated 1,090 grass bags, and Qingsha Township in Gaosheng District borrowed 870 grass bags and 50 reed mats, and have not yet returned them. When Beizhen County checked the flood control equipment, it was found that 1,606 grass bags and 39 wooden stakes were lost or damaged. In Liaoyang County, more than 10,000 flood control grass bags and sacks rotted. Similar situations are quite common in various places. I suggest that the leadership in various riverside areas pay attention to educating the masses to cherish flood control equipment, and establish a management system. Organs or individuals who illegally misappropriate flood control equipment should be investigated and dealt with. (Feng Wenbing)

### 对灾害不要放松警惕

    对灾害不要放松警惕
    还要“考虑考虑”吗？
    河北省石家庄市郊区振头乡农业社今年在北杜村种了一千三百多亩棉花，其中大部分是丰产地。棉花长得很好，社员们情绪也很高。
    但是在七月十一日，突然发现了棉铃虫，蔓延很迅速，到七月十四日几乎每株棉花上都有了虫子。据有经验的农民说：如果不赶快治，几天就可以使棉花减产一半左右。看到这个情况，社里一方面积极组织人力进行捕捉，一面向郊区人民委员会和市人民委员会报告，请求帮助，得到的答复是：考虑考虑，想想办法再说。社里负责人不得已便去请求驻在当地的某步兵学校支援，在这里却得到了真正有力的帮助。七月十五、十六两天（十五日是星期日，十六日是和二十二日的星期日对调过来的），从校首长起，全校的学员、职工以及一部分家属，都在炎热的阳光下，积极帮助农民捉虫。两天内把全部棉田都捉了两遍，有的地还捉了三遍，使这一千三百多亩棉花，免遭更为严重的损失。社员们感动得流下泪来。
    可是，就在这虫灾万分严重，抢救棉花急如星火的时候，市、区政府的负责人和业务干部一个也不见来，据说，还在考虑呢！
            （执言）
    防汛器材哪里去了？
    现在正是汛期，随时有发生大水的可能，防汛器材的准备是十分重要的。可是，最近辽宁省沿河有些地区的农民对防汛器材不加爱护，以致大量腐烂、丢失，公私不分，随便挪用。如盘山县胡家区胜利前进等农业合作社，挪用了1，090条草袋子，高升区青沙乡借用了870条草袋和50领席子，直到现在没有还。北镇县清查防汛器材的时候，发现丢失损坏的草袋子就有1，606条，木桩39根。辽阳县烂掉的防汛草袋、麻袋达一万多条。各地类似这种情况还很不少。我建议各地沿河地区的领导方面注意教育群众爱护防汛器材，并建立保管制度，对非法挪用防汛器材的机关或个人，要进行追查、处理。　（封文炳）
