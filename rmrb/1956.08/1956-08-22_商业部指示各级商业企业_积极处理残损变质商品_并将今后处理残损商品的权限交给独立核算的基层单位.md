    Ministry of Commerce Directs Commercial Enterprises at All Levels
    Actively Handle Damaged and Deteriorated Goods
    And Transfer the Authority to Handle Damaged Goods in the Future to Independently Accountable Grassroots Units
    (This Newspaper News) The Ministry of Commerce issued instructions on August 16 regarding the handling of current, damaged, and deteriorated goods.

    The instructions pointed out that in recent years, in order to stabilize the market, supply the needs of the people, and transform capitalist industry and commerce, state-owned commerce has purchased a large number of goods through processing, ordering, purchasing, and exclusive sales. The vast majority of these goods are marketable, but a considerable portion is difficult to sell for various reasons. Among these difficult-to-sell goods, the vast majority are still needed by the people and must be properly handled through various appropriate methods.

    The instructions required commercial enterprises at all levels to adopt different handling methods according to different situations when dealing with difficult-to-sell goods.

    However, for certain fabrics that are not marketable in location A but may be marketable in location B, or not marketable in spring but marketable in autumn, mutual exchange and seasonal adjustment methods must be adopted to solve the problem, and they must not be treated as damaged or deteriorated goods. For those that are damaged or deteriorated, they should be sold at reduced prices according to the degree of damage or deterioration. Deteriorated coal can also be handled at a reduced price.

    For certain goods that cannot be sold at all in some places, such as high-end watches, cameras, radios, wool fabrics, silks and satins stored in county towns and markets below county towns, as well as ice skates stored in non-freezing areas and high-heeled shoes stored in mountainous areas, they should not be treated as damaged or deteriorated goods. They must be transferred to stores in nearby larger cities that can sell them and must not be sold at reduced prices in the original storage areas.

    For certain goods that are difficult to sell due to outdated styles, they should be handled through processing and modification and should not be sold at reduced prices as damaged or deteriorated goods.

    The instructions required the managers of all city, county branches and sub-branches, as well as central wholesale stations and secondary stations, to personally take action in the process of handling slow-moving, damaged, and deteriorated goods, vigorously mobilize the masses of employees to quickly take inventory of warehouses, and actively handle all damaged and deteriorated goods. When handling these goods, they should report to the local commercial administrative department for approval before implementation. Large-scale handling should be reported to the local People's Committee for approval.

    The instructions pointed out that in order to ensure that all goods that should be handled are handled completely and to minimize national losses, commercial administrative and business departments at all levels must supervise and inspect the work of handling damaged and deteriorated goods by subordinate units. If the inspectors sent by the superior department believe that a certain commodity is not handled properly, they can make suggestions.

    After handling the current damaged and deteriorated goods, the Ministry of Commerce has also stipulated a handling method for some damaged and deteriorated goods that may appear in the future. This method stipulates that the handling of damaged and deteriorated goods should be decided by the managers of companies, stations, and stores at all levels that directly operate the business and independently implement accounting, by convening relevant personnel to discuss and decide, and reporting to the superior company and the commercial administrative department at the same level for record. In this way, the shortcomings of delayed processing caused by the need to report to the superior for approval for certain goods that need to be processed can be avoided.

    This method stipulates that the handling of damaged and deteriorated goods should be based on the principle of minimizing the loss of state property as much as possible and being able to sell the goods, and should be handled in a timely manner according to the degree of damage and deterioration of various goods, and different methods should be adopted.

    Finally, the method also requires commercial units at all levels to separate damaged and discounted goods from good goods. Goods that can be stamped with the words "damaged," "expired," or "bargain" must be stamped to strictly prevent the substitution of inferior goods for good goods and deceiving consumers.

    Both the instructions and the method pointed out that in the process of handling damaged and deteriorated goods, price tags should be publicly displayed, and internal private distribution is prohibited. After handling damaged and deteriorated goods, serious summaries should be made, lessons should be learned, business management should be improved, and better services should be provided for production and consumers.

    商业部指示各级商业企业
    积极处理残损变质商品
    并将今后处理残损商品的权限交给独立核算的基层单位
    本报讯　商业部八月十六日发出了关于处理目前、残损、变质商品的指示。
    指示指出，几年来，为了稳定市场，供应人民需要和改造资本主义工商业，国营商业通过加工、订货、收购、包销的办法购进了大量商品。这些商品的绝大部分都是适销的，但是，也有相当一部分由于种种原因而难以推销。在这些难以推销的商品中，绝大部分商品还是为人民所需要的，必须通过各种妥善的办法加以适当处理。
    指示要求各级商业企业，在处理难以推销的商品的时候，要根据不同情况，分别采取不同的处理办法。
    但是，对于在甲地不适销、在乙地可能适销以及春季不适销，秋季适销的某些布匹，则必须采取相互交流和季节调剂的办法加以解决，不得视作残损变质商品来处理。对于其中残损变质的，应按照其残损变质的程度削价出售。对于变质的煤炭，也可以降价处理。
    对于某些地方根本不能销售的商品，如县城及县城以下市场所存的高级手表、照相机、收音机、呢绒、绸缎，以及根本不结冰地区所存的溜冰鞋，山岳地区所存的高跟鞋等，也不应当作残损变质商品来处理，必须一律调至附近能够销售的较大城市的商店出售，不得在原存地区降价出卖。
    对于某些由于式样过时而难以推销的商品，则应通过加工改制的办法加以处理，不能视作残损变质商品降价出售。
    指示要求各市、县分、支公司和中央批发站、二级站的经理，在处理冷背、残损、变质商品的过程中，必须亲自动手，大力发动职工群众迅速清点库仓，积极处理全部残损变质的商品，在处理的时候，应报经当地商业行政部门批准执行，其中大宗的处理应报经当地人民委员会批准执行。
    指示指出，为了作到既把应该处理的商品全部处理完，又能最大限度的减少国家损失，各级商业行政和业务部门，必须对所属下级单位处理残损变质商品的工作进行监督检查。上级部门派出的检查人员如果认为某项商品处理不当，可以提出建议。
    在处理了目前残损变质的商品以后，对于今后出现的一些残损、变质商品，商业部又规定了一个处理办法。这个办法规定对残损、变质商品的处理，一律由直接经营业务并独立实行核算的各级公司、站、店经理召集有关人员开会讨论决定，并报上级公司和同级商业行政部门备案。这样，便可避免某些需要处理的商品因需报请上级批准，而发生的处理不及时的缺点。
    这个办法规定，处理残损、变质商品，应根据既能尽量减少国家财产损失，又能销得出去的原则，并按照各种商品的残损、变质程度，分别采取不同办法，及时予以处理。
    办法最后还要求各级商业单位对于残损折价商品必须和好商品分开，凡能加盖“残损”“过期”“廉价品”字样的商品必须加盖，严格防止以次顶好，欺骗消费者的行为。
    指示和办法都指出在处理残损、变质商品过程中，应当公开挂出牌价，禁止内部私自分掉。处理残损、变质商品后，应当认真进行总结，从中吸取经验教训，改善经营管理，更好地为生产和消费者服务。
