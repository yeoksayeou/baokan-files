    The First Market Day in Zhu Ting Town After the Early Rice Harvest
    Wu Shiqi
    In mid to late July, many sailboats loaded with general merchandise, fabrics, groceries, and non-staple foods successively arrived at Zhu Ting Town, Xiangtan County, from Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and other places along the Xiang River. This was a large batch of goods that the Zhu Ting Wholesale Store of the State-owned Department Store and the Shuangjiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had transferred to supply consumers in this area after seeing the bumper early rice harvest.

    On the day before the August 1st market day, state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives transferred another batch of goods from the warehouse and displayed them on the counters. Everything was prepared in an orderly manner.

    On August 2nd, a clear morning, young girls, young men, and old people came to the market one after another from the border of Hengshan and You County, from dozens of miles away, carrying local specialties.

    After nine o'clock, a long line of grain delivery teams was lined up in front of the grain purchasing station, and the purchasing staff was busy weighing and calculating accounts. Although the grain purchasing station hired some temporary staff, it was still extremely busy.

    The timber purchasing yard was full of handcarts, and farmers transported hundreds of bundles of fir planks and more than a thousand tree strips. The Chinese medicinal materials purchasing station was also crowded with people, and piles of medicinal materials such as sea buckthorn bark and *Millettia dielsiana* , totaling hundreds of kinds, were piled up in bundles and packages. The agricultural and sideline product purchasing station was also crowded with farmers selling fir bark, orchids, bamboo, charcoal, and other agricultural and sideline products.

    Around ten o'clock, the various outlets and stalls were crowded with people again. The sounds of tearing cloth, abacus calculations, and inquiries were intertwined. A young unmarried couple from Huanglong Township walked into the No. 1 fabric outlet of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The salesperson, Ma Yinbin, introduced them to many kinds of patterns. They looked at this and that, and finally bought 15.45 yuan worth of cloth and left with smiles.

    The three department store outlets of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the department store consignment shops of small vendors were also crowded with buyers. An old man over sixty walked back and forth several times and finally bought half a kilogram of wool. He was very happy. He had been thinking about a woolen sweater for several years, and today it came true.

    The food department was also bustling with people. In order to facilitate customers from afar, the food department specially prepared a stir-fried shredded pork dish for only four jiao a bowl. On this day, the eight service staff of the two food departments received more than 500 customers.

    At four o'clock in the afternoon, the people who went to the market left the market in groups of three or five, carrying their beloved things.

    In the evening, I attended a symposium held by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. After a day of intense work, the total sales amount of the town was 4,756 yuan, which was equivalent to the sum of the business volume for the four days from July 29 to August 1. The purchase amount also increased by 40% compared with the previous market day. Commercial personnel are making better preparations for the peak season market.

    早稻丰收后朱亭镇的第一次集日
    吴士奇
    七月中下旬，湘江河上满载着百货、布匹和杂货、副食品的许多帆船，陆续从长沙、株州、湘潭等地开到了湘潭县朱亭镇。这是国营百货公司朱亭批发商店和双江区供销合作社看到早稻丰收后，为供应这个地区的消费者调来的大批物资。
    八月一日墟期（集日的意思）的前一天，国营商店和供销合作社又从仓库里调出了一批商品，陈设在柜上。一切都准备得有条不紊。
    八月二日，一个晴朗的早晨，年轻的姑娘们、小伙子们、老人们从衡山，攸县的边界，从几十里外，挑着、提着土特产品，先后来到了墟场。
    九点多钟，一条长长的送粮队伍，排列在粮食收购站的门前，收购员忙碌着过秤、算账。尽管粮食收购站雇请了一些临时人员，也还是忙得不可开交。
    木材收购场上，摆满了土车子，农民运来了数百捆杉板，千多根树条。中药材收购站上也是人来人往，一担担、一包包的海桐皮、活血藤等上百种药材堆集起来了。农副产品收购站上，也挤满了出售杉树皮、兰竹、木炭等农副产品的农民。
    十点钟左右，各个门市部里和摊子上又挤满了人。撕布声，算盘声，询问声交织在一块。黄龙乡一对年轻的未婚夫妻，走进了供销社第一布匹门市部里，营业员马寅斌为他俩介绍了好些种花色，他俩选这看那，最后买了价值15.45元的布，笑盈盈地走了。
    供销社三个百货门市部和小商贩百货代销店里也挤满了购买者。一位上六十岁的老爹，来回走了几遍，最后买了一磅半毛线。他十分高兴。他想了几年的毛线衣，今天实现了。
    饮食部里的人也是川流不息，饮食部为了便利远路来的客人，还特地备了一种只四角一盆的炒肉丝，这一天两个饮食部的八个服务员，接待了五百多位顾客。
    下午四点钟，赶集的人们提着心爱的东西，三五成群地离开了墟场。
    晚间我参加了供销合作社召开的座谈会。经过一天紧张工作，全镇销售总金额是4，756元，相当于七月二十九至八月一日四天营业额的总和；收购额也比较上一场上升了40％。商业人员们正在为旺季市场作更好的准备。
