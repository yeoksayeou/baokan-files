In Lanzhou, the city of melons and fruits, various melons are already on the market. The melon shops and stalls on the streets are filled with melons of various colors: white, green, black, and patterned. Here you can find the famous Lanzhou melon, Drunken melon, Hami melon, Yellow fragrant melon, Green fragrant melon, "Jinta Temple," and "Jinhe Horse." Whether you are strolling on the street or visiting places like Wuquan Mountain and Yantan, you can enjoy all kinds of fragrant and delicious melons. When you approach a melon stall and see the already cut red or green melon flesh and the juice seeping out, and smell the refreshing fragrance, you can't help but want to eat some. In this season, the people living in Lanzhou are truly blessed.

There are more than ten varieties of melons produced in Lanzhou. Different varieties have different flavors. The Lanzhou melon (i.e., Bailan melon) is sweet, the Drunken melon and Hami melon have a hint of wine flavor, the "Jinta Temple" and "Shili Xiang" melons are crispy, and the dry sandy land watermelon has a lot of water and sugar, melting in your mouth. Among these melons, the best is the Lanzhou melon. Last year, this melon was shipped to several countries in Southeast Asia via Hong Kong and was deeply loved by overseas Chinese, who called it "Lanzhou Honey Melon."

The area of land used for growing melons in the suburbs of Lanzhou is about 13,000 mu. The climate here is dry with low rainfall, which is suitable for the growth of melons. It has a long history of melon production, and farmers have accumulated rich experience, with many melon-growing experts who have inherited their skills for generations.

Since the realization of cooperation in the suburbs of Lanzhou this spring, farmers have been highly enthusiastic about production, and there have been many improvements in cultivation techniques, with a significant increase in the amount of fertilizer applied. It is estimated that this year's melon production will increase significantly compared to last year.

This year, 5 million jin of Lanzhou melons will be shipped to foreign countries and major cities in China. The first batch of 240,000 jin has already been shipped to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and other places in late July.

    兰州街头瓜香浓
    燕树桂
    在瓜果城市的兰州，各种瓜已经上市。街道上的瓜店里和瓜摊子上，摆满了白的、绿的、黑的、花的各种皮色的瓜。这里有著名的兰州瓜、醉瓜、哈密瓜、黄香瓜、绿香瓜、“金塔寺”、“金河马”。不论是在街上散步，还是在五泉山、雁滩等地游览，都可以吃到各种香甜可口的瓜。当你一走近瓜摊，看到那已经切开的红色或绿色的瓜瓤和它渗出来的汁液，闻到那扑鼻的香味，你就非吃一吃不可。在这个季节里，住在兰州的人真是太幸福了。
    兰州出产的瓜，有十多种。品种不一，味道各有不同。兰州瓜（即白兰瓜）香甜，醉瓜、哈密瓜甜中带有几分酒味，“金塔寺”、“十里香”瓜吃起来香脆，旱沙地西瓜水份大、糖份多，放在口里即可溶化。这些瓜里面最好的要算兰州瓜。这种瓜去年经香港运到东南亚几个国家，深为华侨所喜爱，称之为“兰州蜜瓜”。
    兰州郊区种瓜的土地面积约有一万三千亩。这个地方气候干燥，降雨量少，适宜瓜的生长。它产瓜的历史已经相当久，农民积有丰富的经验，有很多祖传几辈的种瓜能手。
    今年春天兰州郊区实现合作化以后，农民生产热情很高，耕作技术有很多改进，施肥数量有很大增加。预计今年瓜的产量较去年增加很多。
    今年兰州瓜将有五百万斤运销国外和国内各大城市。第一批二十四万斤，已经在七月下旬运往北京，上海、香港、新嘉坡等地。
