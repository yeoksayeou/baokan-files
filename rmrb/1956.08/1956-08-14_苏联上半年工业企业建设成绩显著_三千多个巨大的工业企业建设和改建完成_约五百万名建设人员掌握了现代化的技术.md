　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from TASS: The Soviet Union completed the construction, reconstruction, and expansion of over three thousand five hundred huge industrial enterprises in the first half of this year, including over four hundred power stations. Currently, there are approximately five million construction workers throughout the Soviet Union who have mastered modern technology.
　　From 1929 to 1955, the Soviet Union constructed and restored over twenty-nine thousand huge industrial enterprises, over five thousand state-owned farms, and over nine thousand machine tractor stations. In existing and newly established industrial centers, in the vast forests of Siberia, and on the remote and expansive wilderness, Soviet construction workers have established thousands of enterprises, state-owned farms, machine tractor stations, as well as over two thousand new cities and workers' towns.
　　While undertaking enterprise construction, the Soviet Union also carried out large-scale residential construction. During the period from 1929 to 1955, a total residential area of approximately 430 million square meters was constructed and restored in cities and workers' towns alone. During the fourth and fifth Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union's agricultural areas also constructed and restored five million houses.
　　In the years of the previous Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union expanded the network of social and cultural institutions, establishing and restoring seventy-five thousand six hundred schools, and thousands of hospitals, clinics, kindergartens, nurseries, libraries, theaters, sanatoriums, rest homes, gardens, and parks.
　　The total investment in construction in the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan amounts to 990 billion rubles, more than half the investment in this area during the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联在今年上半年建成、改建和扩建了三千五百多个巨大的工业企业，其中有四百个以上的电力站。目前，全苏联大约有五百万名掌握现代化技术的建设人员。
    自1929到1955年，苏联共建成和恢复了两万九千多个巨大的工业企业、五千多个国营农场、九千个以上机器拖拉机站。在原有的和新建立的工业中心，在西伯利亚大森林地带和辽远广阔的荒地上，苏联的建设人员已经建立起数以千计的企业、国营农场、机器拖拉机站以及两千多个新的城市和工人镇。
    苏联在展开企业建设的同时，也进行了大规模的住宅建设。从1929年到1955年的时期内，单在城市和工人镇就建造和恢复了总面积约达四亿三千万平方公尺的住宅。苏联农业地区在第四个和第五个五年计划期间也建造和恢复了五百万幢住宅。
    在前几个五年计划年代里，苏联扩大了社会文化机构网，建立和恢复了七万五千六百所学校，数以千计的医院、诊疗所、幼儿园、托儿所、图书馆、戏院、疗养院、休养所、花园和公园。
    苏联在第六个五年计划在建设方面的投资总额达九千九百亿卢布，比第五个五年计划的这方面投资多一半以上。
