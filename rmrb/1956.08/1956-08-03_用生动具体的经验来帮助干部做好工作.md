    Use Vivid and Specific Experiences to Help Cadres Do Their Work
    Since the People's Daily expanded to eight pages, it has introduced too few experiences in industrial and agricultural production, enterprise and cooperative management, and political work. It is hoped that the newspaper will pay attention to using vivid and specific experiences to educate and help cadres do their work well.　(Xia Zheng)

    用生动具体的经验来帮助干部做好工作
    人民日报在改出八版以后，对工农业生产、企业和合作社的经营管理以及政治工作方面的经验，介绍得太少。希望报纸要注意用生动具体的经验来教育和帮助干部做好工作。　（夏峥）
