Eliminating Unintelligible Writing

Readers have written to criticize the unintelligible writing in articles and news reports published in this newspaper. Here are a few examples:

Are "Orphans" Also Enjoying a "Happy Old Age"?

Zhang Zhichun writes: On August 16th, on the fourth page under the headline "Caring for the People's Livelihood," there was a news item titled "No Longer Destitute." It said: "Since its establishment in May of this year, the Fenyang Reformatory in Shanxi Province has taken in a total of forty-seven disabled elderly and orphans who were destitute. Now they are all living a happy and pleasant old age." Editor, please tell me: Are the "orphans" in the reformatory also enjoying a "happy old age"? How can you be so careless with words?

At What Place are They "Straining Their Eyes"?

Yu Feng and Xu Zhongyuan write: On August 6th, on the fourth page, in the article "They are Looking Towards the Mainland," there is the following sentence: "Those mothers and wives whose sons and husbands were captured while fishing at sea are straining their eyes and calling out to the mainland." This is inaccurate. The mothers and wives whose sons and husbands were captured by the Chiang Kai-shek troops are naturally facing Taiwan, "straining their eyes" for their loved ones. How can you say that they are "straining their eyes and calling out to the mainland"?

Who are the Two Ophthalmologists?

Zhou Jianying writes: The news item "Heterologous Corneal Transplantation" published on the seventh page on July 25th stated: "Two ophthalmologists from Liuzhou People's Hospital are studying the heterologous corneal transplantation of Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao..." I want to know: Who are these two ophthalmologists from Liuzhou People's Hospital? And which hospital do Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao belong to? In fact, Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao are the two ophthalmologists from Liuzhou People's Hospital. This sentence, due to its ungrammatical structure and unclear logic, has created a significant factual error.

What Do We Need to Know?

Opinions on the "In the Capital" Column

I really enjoy reading the "In the Capital" column in the newspaper. As far as I know, many people who do not live and work in Beijing, like me, also like this column. Because the words "Capital" have a special attraction, people feel particularly close to it.

However, we do not simply want to know about the daily lives of the people in the capital, such as the small vegetable markets, the conductors on the buses, the children's carts that serve the children... Of course, these also reflect some aspects of the capital, but they are not the main ones. What we need to know more about are the many things in the capital that are worthy of pride. For example, the article "In Front of Tiananmen Square" made us feel as if we were personally witnessing the magnificent scene in front of Tiananmen Square. Also, the twelve-year plan for the renovation of the Forbidden City in the capital, the construction of the largest swimming pool in the country in Taoranting Park, etc., are all the news items that we love to read the most. Unfortunately, writers rarely write articles about these aspects, and reporters rarely write news about them.

We also need to know about the industrial, cultural, educational, and municipal construction situation in the capital, the modern buildings in the capital, and the long-term plans for the capital's construction. The capital has always been famous as a cultural city, but what is it really like? Please give us pictures and news about this! (Mao Yu)

    读者、作者、编者
    消灭文理不通的现象
    读者来信，对本报发表的文章和新闻中的文理不通的缺点，提出了批评，以下是几个例子：
    “孤幼”也在过“愉快的晚年”么？
    张稚春来信：8月16日第四版在“关心人民的生活”标题下，有一则“不再无依无靠了”的消息说：“山西省汾阳教养院，从今年五月份成立以来，一共收容了无依无靠的残老、孤幼四十七人，现在他们都过着幸福而愉快的晚年。”请问编辑同志：教养院里的“孤幼”也在过“愉快的晚年”么？你们对待文字怎么能这样粗心大意呢？
  对什么地方“望眼欲穿”？
    御风、徐中元来信：8月6日第四版“他们眼望着祖国大陆”一文中有这样一句话：“那些因在海上捕鱼而被抓去儿子和丈夫的母亲和妻子们，望眼欲穿地对着大陆呼唤。”这是不确切的。被蒋军抓去了儿子和丈夫的母亲和妻子们，自然是面对着台湾，对她们的亲人“望眼欲穿”，怎么能说她们“望眼欲穿地对着大陆呼唤”呢？
    两位眼科医师是谁？
    周建英来信：7月25日第七版刊登的“异种角膜移植术”尚未获得成功的消息中说：“柳州市人民医院两个眼科医师研究徐延安和唐继道的异种角膜移植术……”。我想知道：这柳州市人民医院两位眼科医师是谁？徐延安和唐继道两人又是哪个医院的呢？事实上，徐延安和唐继道两人就是柳州市人民医院的两位眼科医师。这句话因为语法不通，逻辑不明而造成了一个显著的事实错误。
    我们需要知道什么？
    对“在首都”专栏的意见
    报纸上的“在首都”专栏，我很喜欢看，据我所知道的，很多同我一样不在北京生活和工作的人，也很喜欢这个专栏。因为“首都”这两个字，是特别有吸引力的，人们对它特别感到亲切。
    但是，我们并不是单纯地想知道首都人民的日常生活，譬如什么小菜市啦，汽车上的售票员啦，为儿童服务的儿童车啦……。当然，这些也反映了首都的一些情况，但不是主要的。我们更需要知道的是首都的很多足以让人引以自豪的东西。譬如：“在天安门前”那篇文章，使我们仿佛亲自看到天安门前那种气象万千的景象。还有首都故宫修缮的十二年规划，陶然亭修建了全国最大的游泳池等，都是我们最爱看的消息。可惜，作家们很少写这方面的通讯，记者们也很少写这方面的消息。
    我们还需要知道首都的工业、文化教育和市政建设的情况，需要知道首都的一些现代化的建筑，以及首都建设的长远规划。首都一向是以文化城闻名于世的，但是，究竟是什么样子呢？请给我们这方面的图片和消息吧！　（毛羽）
