    Be Good at Cooperating and Working with Non-Party Cadres
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    In our institutions, schools, and mass organizations, there are Communist Party cadres and also non-Party cadres. There is a relationship of cooperation and joint work between them. For several years, the relationship of cooperation and joint work between Party and non-Party cadres has been basically good, and has been continuously improving. Most Communist Party members respect the work authority of non-Party cadres and have helped them in various ways to achieve results in their work, and have also provided necessary care and consideration in their lives. Especially recently, the Party Central Committee convened a conference on the issue of intellectuals, and later clearly put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and various democratic parties. The relationship of cooperation and joint work between Party and non-Party cadres has had many new improvements. However, there are also some institutions, schools, and mass organizations where the relationship between Party and non-Party cadres is not normal: some Party member cadres only see the leading role of the Communist Party and do not see that non-Party individuals also have a significant role; they only see their own strengths and do not see the strengths of others; they only see their own progress and do not see the progress of others. Therefore, they are unwilling to actively cooperate and work with non-Party individuals; or they are only willing to cooperate with non-Party individuals who are progressing rapidly, but are unwilling to cooperate with non-Party individuals who are progressing more slowly. They also have some degree of disrespect for the work authority of non-Party cadres. Either the division of labor is not clear, leaving people with little to do. Or good working conditions are not prepared for non-Party cadres. Some also make decisions arbitrarily and do not pay attention to consultation with non-Party cadres. These have all affected the initiative and enthusiasm of non-Party cadres in their work, preventing non-Party cadres from making good use of their knowledge and experience and fully发挥their strengths.
    Everyone knows that the socialist revolution and socialist construction we are currently undertaking is an extremely glorious and great, but also extremely arduous and complex undertaking. In the struggle to complete this undertaking, the Chinese Communist Party plays a major leading role. However, at any time, Communist Party members are only a minority of the people, and their knowledge and experience are, after all, limited. If there is only the effort of Communist Party members, without the active participation and support of the broad masses of the people, and without the close cooperation of the broad non-Party cadres, the socialist cause cannot be victorious. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee has consistently attached great importance to the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front, attaches importance to strengthening the unity and cooperation between Party and non-Party cadres, and believes that this cooperation is fixed and unchangeable, forever.
    In consolidating the people's democratic united front, correctly handling the relationship of cooperation and joint work between Party and non-Party cadres in institutions, schools, and mass organizations is of great significance. On the one hand, this is because non-Party cadres in institutions, schools, and mass organizations come from various different classes and strata and maintain contact with people from all sides. If the relationship of cooperation and joint work is handled well, our Party and state organs will be able to constantly hear the voices and opinions of all sides, and will be more thorough and comprehensive when considering and deciding on policies, guidelines, and plans. At the same time, we will be able to discover and correct shortcomings and errors in our work more promptly, and maintain correct leadership. On the other hand, the cause of socialist construction requires talent in many fields, especially a large number of scientific and technical personnel and specialists, which requires us to consciously cooperate with non-Party individuals even more. The vast majority of non-Party cadres working in our institutions and schools are intellectuals, and many of them are senior scientific and technical personnel who possess the diverse knowledge, skills, and rich experience necessary for national construction. If the cooperation between Party and non-Party cadres is handled well, non-Party cadres will be able to make good use of their strengths and promote the smooth development of the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, the idea and practice of some Party member cadres looking down on non-Party individuals and being unwilling to cooperate and work with them is completely wrong and is a concrete manifestation of sectarianism, which can only have a harmful impact on the country's socialist construction.
    To improve relations and fully发挥the strength of non-Party cadres, it is necessary to ensure that non-Party cadres truly have positions and power. When appointing them, they should be assigned appropriate positions based on their abilities and specialties, and a clear division of labor should be made between the leading and deputy positions. At the same time, they should be given power commensurate with their positions, so that they have all the convenient conditions for carrying out their work. Only having a work position without a clear division of labor means having a position and power in name only. If there is a clear division of labor but no convenient conditions for carrying out the work, if matters that should be known cannot be known, if telegrams and documents that should be seen cannot be seen, if meetings that should be attended cannot be attended, non-Party individuals will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities well, and their enthusiasm and initiative will have no way to发挥. But today, some Party member cadres have not done this. These comrades are sometimes so busy that they do not even have time to rest, but they do not trust non-Party individuals and do not allow them to take on the tasks that they should be responsible for; or although they have assigned certain tasks to non-Party individuals, they are unwilling to boldly放手let them do it. This situation is clearly very abnormal and we hope that it can be quickly corrected.
    The democratic style and spirit of consultation of Communist Party members are also extremely important in improving the relationship of cooperation and joint work between Party and non-Party cadres. Consultation on matters, on the one hand, can give non-Party cadres the opportunity to fully express their opinions, enhance their enthusiasm, initiative, and sense of responsibility in their work, and thus advance more quickly; on the other hand, it can indeed enable the Communist Party and state organs to hear widely and prevent many errors and shortcomings. Conversely, if Communist Party members are self-righteous and do not like to listen to the opinions of non-Party cadres; or are only willing to listen to opinions that are the same as their own and are unwilling to listen to different and opposing opinions, non-Party cadres will not be willing to express their opinions, or will not say everything. Over time, this will create estrangement between Party and non-Party cadres and damage the political enthusiasm and work initiative of non-Party cadres.
    Of course, emphasizing respect for the opinions of non-Party cadres does not mean that we should maintain a hypocritical and vulgar harmony with non-Party cadres. If we clearly know that some of their opinions are incorrect, but do not point them out; if we clearly discover that there are shortcomings and errors in their work, but do not conduct sincere and frank criticism. This polite attitude cannot truly improve relations; on the contrary, it will make non-Party cadres think that the Party does not trust them. The correct attitude should be to treat each other with sincerity and handle contradictions and differences between each other with a comradeship. But today, in some institutions, schools, and mass organizations, in addition to some Party member cadres who severely lack a democratic style and cannot tolerate different and opposing opinions, there are still many Party member cadres who adopt a polite attitude and a laissez-faire attitude in their cooperation and joint work with non-Party cadres. The reason why these comrades adopt this attitude is mainly that they do not see or underestimate the progress and improvement in the political and ideological awareness of non-Party cadres in recent years, and they think that non-Party cadres are unwilling and unable to accept criticism. In fact, many non-Party cadres are willing to accept and are able to accept criticism. They very much hope that Party member cadres will impolitely point out their shortcomings and errors and conduct necessary checks and appraisals of their work.
    In order to further improve the relationship of cooperation and joint work between Party and non-Party cadres in institutions, schools, and mass organizations in the future, we believe that it is necessary to conduct regular propaganda and education on the united front policy within the Party, criticize various ideas and behaviors that are not conducive to the unity and cooperation between Party and non-Party cadres, and make Party member cadres understand the importance and long-term nature of uniting and cooperating with non-Party individuals. At the same time, based on the principle that the relationship between Party and non-Party members in institutions, schools, and mass organizations is basically an internal relationship of the working class (non-Party cadres are also wage laborers), necessary revisions and supplements should be made to the work system of institutions, schools, and mass organizations to make it conform to the nature and requirements of the united front work in institutions, schools, and mass organizations, and to make it conducive to发挥the initiative and enthusiasm of non-Party cadres.

    要善于同非党干部合作共事
    本报评论员
    在我们的机关、学校和群众团体中，有共产党员干部，也有非党干部。他们之间存在着合作共事的关系。几年来，党和非党干部的合作共事关系基本上是好的，并且是不断进步的。大多数共产党员对于非党干部的工作职权都是尊重的，并且从各方面帮助他们在工作上做出了成绩，在生活上也作了必要的关怀和照顾。特别是最近时期，党中央召开了知识分子问题会议，以后又明确地提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，党和非党干部的合作共事关系有了很多新的改进。但是也还有一些机关、学校和群众团体的党和非党干部的关系不够正常：有一些党员干部只看见共产党的领导作用，看不见党外人士也有重大的作用；只看见自己的长处，看不见人家的长处；只看见自己的进步，看不见人家的进步。所以他们就不愿意主动地同党外人士合作共事；或者只愿意同进步很快的党外人士合作，而不愿意同进步较慢的党外人士合作。对于非党干部的工作职权，他们也有某种程度的不尊重。或者是分工不明确，弄得人家没有多少事情可作。或者是没有给非党干部准备很好的工作条件。也有的是遇事独断专行，不注意同非党干部协商。这些都影响了非党干部在工作中的主动性和积极性，使非党干部不能很好地运用他们的知识和经验，充分发挥他们的长处。
    大家知道，我国正在进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，是一个极其光荣伟大、同时也是极其艰巨复杂的事业。在为完成这个事业而进行的斗争中，中国共产党起着主要的领导作用。但是不论在任何时候，共产党员都只是人民群众中的少数，他们的知识和经验毕竟是有限的。如果只有共产党员的努力，而没有广大人民的积极参加和支持，没有广大非党干部的紧密合作，社会主义事业是不可能胜利的。正因为这样，所以党中央一贯非常重视人民民主统一战线的巩固和扩大，重视加强党和非党干部的团结合作，并且认为这种合作是固定不移的，永远不变的。
    在巩固人民民主统一战线中，正确地处理机关、学校和群众团体中的党和非党干部的合作共事关系，具有十分重要的意义。这一方面是因为机关、学校和群众团体中的非党干部来自各个不同的阶级和阶层，同各方面的人保持着联系。合作共事的关系搞好了，我们的党和国家机关就能够经常听到各方面的呼声和意见，在考虑和决定政策、方针和计划时就会更周密、更全面，同时也就能够更及时地发现和纠正工作中的缺点和错误，保持正确的领导。另一方面，社会主义建设事业需要多方面的人才，特别是需要大批的科学技术人员和专门家，这就更加要求我们自觉地同党外人士合作。在我们的机关、学校中工作的非党干部，绝大多数都是知识分子，其中还有许多人是高级科学技术人员，他们具有为国家建设所必需的多方面的知识、技能和丰富的经验。党和非党干部的合作搞好了，非党干部就能够很好地发挥自己的长处，促进社会主义建设事业的顺利发展。因此，有些党员干部看不起党外人士，不愿意同他们合作共事的想法和作法是完全错误的，是一种宗派主义情绪的具体表现，只能对国家的社会主义建设发生有害的影响。
    要搞好关系，并且充分发挥非党干部的力量，就必须保证非党干部真正有职有权。在任用他们的时候，应当根据他们的能力和特长，分配给适当的职务，在正副职之间作明确的分工，同时赋予与职务相称的权力，使他们有进行工作的一切便利条件。只有工作职务，没有明确的分工，有职有权就是空的。有了明确的分工，如果没有进行工作的便利条件，应该与闻的事不能与闻，应该看的电报文件不能看，应该参加的会议不能参加，党外人士也不可能很好地履行职责，他们的积极性和主动性也就无从发挥。而今天有些党员干部却没有这样作。这些同志有时忙得连休息的时间也没有，但却不相信党外人士，不让他们负起应当担负的任务；或者虽然分配了党外人士以一定的任务，但是不肯大胆放手地让他们去作。这种情况显然是很不正常的，希望能够迅速地纠正。
    共产党员的民主作风和遇事协商的精神，在搞好党和非党干部的合作共事关系上也是极为重要的。遇事协商，一方面是可以使非党干部获得充分发表意见的机会，提高他们工作上的积极性、主动性和责任感，因而更快地前进；另一方面也的确能使共产党和国家机关广听博闻，防止许多错误和缺点。相反的，如果共产党员自以为是，不喜欢听取非党干部的意见；或者只愿意听取同自己相同的意见，不愿意听取不同的和反对的意见，非党干部有意见也就不愿意发表，或者是言而不尽。这样，久而久之，就会在党和非党干部之间造成隔阂，伤害非党干部的政治热情和工作积极性。
    当然，强调尊重非党干部的意见，并不是要我们同非党干部保持虚伪庸俗的一团和气。明明知道他们的某些意见不正确，也不向他们指出；明明发现他们的工作中有缺点和错误，也不进行诚恳坦率的批评。这种客客气气的态度，并不能真正搞好关系，反而会使非党干部认为这是党对他们不信任。正确的态度，应当是彼此相待以诚，用同志的态度来处理彼此间的矛盾和分歧。而今天在一些机关、学校和群众团体中，除了有部分党员干部十分缺乏民主作风，不能容忍不同的和反对的意见以外，在同非党干部的合作共事上采取客客气气，彼此相安无事态度的党员干部，也还是不少的。这些同志所以采取这种态度，主要是他们看不见或者低估了几年来非党干部的政治思想觉悟的进步和提高，以为非党干部不愿意和不能够接受批评。其实，许多非党干部是愿意接受、也能够接受批评的，他们很希望党员干部不客气地指出他们的缺点和错误，对他们的工作进行必要的检查和鉴定。
    为了在今后进一步改善机关、学校和群众团体中的党和非党干部的合作共事关系，我们认为有必要经常在党内进行统一战线政策的宣传教育，批判各种不利于党和非党干部团结合作的思想和行为，使党员干部都懂得和党外人士团结合作的重要性和长期性。同时还应当根据机关、学校和群众团体中的党和非党关系基本上是工人阶级内部关系（非党干部也都是工资劳动者）这个原则，对机关、学校和群众团体的工作制度作必要的修改和补充，使之符合于机关、学校和群众团体中的统一战线工作的性质和要求，使之有利于发挥非党干部的积极性主动性。
