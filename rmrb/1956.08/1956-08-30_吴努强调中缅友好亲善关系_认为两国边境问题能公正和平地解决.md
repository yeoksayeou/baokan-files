Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 29th: U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma and former Prime Minister, told reporters from the Rangoon "Nation" newspaper on August 28 that "the goodwill existing between Burma and China is sufficient to ensure that they can find a just solution to the problem on their own."

    U Nu, when speaking about the Sino-Burmese border issue, pointed out, "I firmly believe that this is a problem that Burma can handle, a problem that can be resolved with China in a friendly spirit."

    U Nu believes that China and Burma are friendly. He said that he was deeply moved by the sincerity and sympathy shown by Soong Ching Ling when she recently discussed the Sino-Burmese border issue with him. U Nu also pointed out that China had given Burma the most favorable terms in terms of barter trade. "The fact is that when we had 200,000 tons of spoiled rice, China was willing to buy it, even though China did not particularly need this rice."

    U Nu said, "It is my view that it is appropriate to raise diplomatic opinions through formal channels."

    A reporter asked: Why has no initiative been taken so far, despite the strong opinions expressed by newspapers and certain political figures? U Nu said, "The government cannot be incited to make irresponsible statements or take irresponsible steps." U Nu pointed out, "An appropriate atmosphere of mutual trust and mutual amity should be created to help fairly resolve outstanding issues."

    U Nu also believes that face-to-face talks may find a fair and peaceful solution.

    A reporter asked: "Are you prepared to lead or send a Burmese delegation to China, or invite a Chinese delegation with great power to come for direct negotiations?" U Nu said without hesitation: "We are ready to go to China or receive a Chinese delegation at any time."

    In his reply to the newspaper's reporter, U Nu also said, "This is a problem we must handle with the utmost patience. I have appealed for restraint. I reiterate this appeal to the press."

    U Nu also pointed out, "We must never ignore the fact that, regardless of what government system either country may adopt at any time, we are destined to coexist as neighbors."

    吴努强调中缅友好亲善关系
    认为两国边境问题能公正和平地解决
    新华社仰光29日电　缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席、前总理吴努8月28日对仰光“民族报”记者发表谈话说，“缅甸和中国之间存在的善意足够保证仅仅靠它们自己就能求得问题的公正解决”。
    吴努就中缅边境问题发表谈话时指出，“我十分相信，这是一个缅甸能够处理的问题，是一个能够同中国以友好精神来解决的问题”。
    吴努认为，中国和缅甸是亲善的。他说，他深为宋庆龄最近同他在讨论中缅边境问题时所抱的热诚和同情的态度所感动。吴努还指出，在换货贸易方面，中国曾经给缅甸最有利的条件。“事实是，当我们有二十万吨坏了的大米的时候，中国却愿意收购它，虽然中国并不特别需要这些大米。”
    吴努说，“通过正式途径来提出外交上的意见，是我认为适当的做法”。
    有记者问：尽管报纸和某些政界人士提出强烈的意见，为什么到目前为止还没有采取主动？吴努说，“政府不能受人煽动来发表不负责任的声明或者采取不负责任的步骤”。吴努指出，“应当创造有助于公平解决悬而未决的问题的互信和互相亲善的适当的气氛”。
    吴努还认为，面对面的会谈可能找出公正和和平的解决办法。
    有记者问：“你是否准备率领或是派遣一个缅甸代表团到中国去，或是邀请一个具有大权的中国代表团前来，举行直接谈判？”吴努毫不迟疑地说：“我们随时都准备好到中国去或是接待一个中国代表团来”。
    吴努在答复该报记者时还说，“这是一个我们必须以最大的耐心来处理的问题。我曾经呼吁过要采取克制态度。我重新向报界提出这个呼吁”。
    吴努还指出，“我们决不能无视这一事实：不管两国中任何一个国家在任何时候可能采取什么政府制度，我们注定地要作为近邻来共处”。
