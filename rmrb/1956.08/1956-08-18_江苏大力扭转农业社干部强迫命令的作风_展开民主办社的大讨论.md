    Jiangsu Vigorously Reverses the Coercive and Commandist Work Style of Agricultural Cooperative Cadres
    Launches a Broad Discussion on Democratic Cooperative Management

    (Our Dispatch) A broad discussion on "democratic cooperative management" has unfolded among the vast ranks of cadres in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province. The first phase of this discussion concluded on August 4th, and initial results have already been achieved. Many cooperative cadres have changed their coercive and commandist work style and have begun to lead production in a democratic manner.

    "Democratic cooperative management" is an important issue after the realization of cooperation in the countryside. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee pointed out when leading this discussion: At present, 76% of the farmers in Jiangsu have joined advanced cooperatives. The farmers have handed over their land, cattle, and large farm tools to the cooperatives and placed all their hopes on the cooperatives. Therefore, they expect the cooperative cadres to lead them in running the cooperatives well, develop production, and increase income. At the same time, in the past, farmers worked independently, each caring for themselves. Now that everyone lives in a large family, they also demand that cooperative members and cooperative cadres must care for and respect each other, especially that cooperative cadres treat people equally, act justly, and take the lead in being democratic, harmonious, and united. The urgency of this issue was made even more acute and pressing by the suicide of Zhou Dejin, a poor peasant cooperative member in Jurong County. The Provincial Party Committee seized upon this tragic event and launched a discussion on "democratic cooperative management" through the Nanjing Xinhua Daily.

    Zhou Dejin was a poor peasant cooperative member in the Gangzi Village Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County. He was active in production and honest. Because the production team leader, Wang Zhengfu, did not fairly record work points, and Zhou Dejin was injured while working, he was not assigned lighter work. He had argued with the team leader several times and reported the matter to Chen Yilu (a Communist Party member), the director of the cooperative's supervisory committee and head of the production brigade, requesting a transfer to another group. However, Chen Yilu simplistically and harshly labeled him, scolding Zhou Dejin for standing on the same line as rich peasants and groundlessly accusing him of damaging the latch on the village granary door, leading Zhou Dejin to mistakenly believe that the cooperative suspected him of having political problems. As a result, he became mentally deranged and ultimately hanged himself.

    After this incident, the Jurong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted an in-depth investigation and reported to the Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the time: "At present, cooperative cadres like Wang Zhengfu and Chen Yilu are not isolated cases in the countryside. They are enthusiastic about the cause of socialism and want to do their jobs well. They are not bad people who violate laws and discipline. However, their ideological level is low, their work experience is lacking, and particularly, they do not care enough about the fate of others and cannot treat the masses with empathy. Therefore, in their work, they often lack the correct solutions to problems, unconsciously treat the masses with simplicity and impatience, even resorting to hurtful words and labeling, turning good deeds into bad ones. The Party should not simply punish such cadres but should proceed from the standpoint of care and unity, patiently educate them, explain the principles clearly, help them raise their awareness, correct their mistakes, and improve their work style." The Provincial Party Committee issued a notice in June, requiring all rural branches of the Party in the province to use the Jurong County Committee's investigation report on the Zhou Dejin incident as teaching material to conduct broad and in-depth discussions and education on democratic cooperative management. Through reading, casual talks, and discussions, the Party branches would encourage cooperative cadres to overcome their erroneous work styles and methods through self-reflection, criticism, and self-criticism. Comrade Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, twice demanded and arranged at the Provincial Party Committee's enlarged meeting that the local prefectural, municipal, and county committees and village branches seriously lead this discussion and pay attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses to run agricultural cooperatives well. The Suzhou, Songjiang, Nantong, and other local prefectural committees and the Changshu, Baoying, and other county committees of the Chinese Communist Party successively issued instructions, requiring the grassroots organizations of the Party in various places to organize and lead Party members and township and cooperative cadres to earnestly participate in the discussion on democratic cooperative management. The Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station and the nineteen county newspapers and radio stations in Jiangdu, Baoshan, Jurong, and other places also launched publicity and discussions on democratic cooperative management, reporting on the local discussion situation. In Changshu County, each township generally had around 400 people participating in the discussion. The Party training classes in Jintan, Gaoyou, and other counties treated the "democratic cooperative management" discussion as one of the most important contents of study. From mid-July to August 10th, Xinhua Daily had received more than 600 pieces of submissions participating in the discussion on democratic cooperative management.

    This discussion is being conducted by explaining principles, discussing right and wrong, setting up examples, and raising the understanding of grassroots cadres to promote cadres to consciously improve their thinking and work style. The Xinhua Daily has now concluded the first phase of the discussion. In the first phase, the following questions were successively discussed: "Is economic restriction not a form of coercion and commandism?", "Can tasks be completed without coercion and commandism?", "How should backward cooperative members be treated?". The discussion mainly criticized the ideology and work style of coercion and commandism and advocated repeated and patient specific education of cooperative members to establish the ideology and work style of democratic management. The second phase of the discussion began on August 4th, mainly criticizing the erroneous ideology and work style of not running cooperatives according to the principles of democratic management, and advocating the ideology and work style of relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses to run cooperatives. Afterward, the discussion will mainly focus on how to correctly combine collective interests and individual interests, and study solutions to address the causes of coercion and commandism and failure to manage cooperatives according to the principles of democratic management.

    This discussion has achieved initial results: The Party members and cadres who participated in the discussion have generally improved their thinking and have been improving their work while learning. For example, after cadres of the Heping No. 1 Cooperative in Jurong County participated in the discussion, they realized that arbitrarily deducting work points was a coercive act of forcing the masses to obey the decisions of the cooperative committee economically. They then abolished all regulations on arbitrarily deducting work points. Cao A'da, the director of the Baofeng No. 3 Cooperative in Wu County, used to have a very rigid attitude in his work. After participating in the "democratic cooperative management" discussion organized by the township branch, he realized the harm of coercion and commandism, and his work style changed. His attitude towards cooperative members became kind and sincere, and his work style became meticulous and thorough. As a result, cooperative members reflected, "It's as if a new director has come to our cooperative." From the director to the twenty-three production team leaders of the No. 3 Branch of the Jiangdong Vegetable Production Cooperative in the Yuhuatai District of Nanjing City participated in the discussion. They put forward seventy-four rationalization proposals for improving their work style and have begun to lead production with a new work style. The cooperative re-arranged labor hours during hot weather, doing more work in the morning and evening and resting more at noon. Xu Renhai of the 21st Production Team got back the fifteen work points that had been deducted from him arbitrarily, and he got up at two o'clock the next morning to water the fertilizer. The work style of the sixty-three Party members and cooperative cadres of the Youhao No. 2 Agricultural Cooperative in Yutai Township, Pandang District, Binhai County, has also undergone obvious changes. For example, recently, when Yan Jiabang, the leader of the sixth production team, assigned cooperative member Mei Youcheng to plant sweet potatoes, Mei was unwilling to go. Yan Jiabang changed his past rigid attitude, patiently explaining the reasons. Mei Youcheng was moved and happily accepted the assignment. He also told people everywhere, "The team leader is so amiable, we can't be careless in production." The cooperative members also displayed their enthusiasm. After studying, cadres of the Heping No. 1 Cooperative in Luoshe Township, Jurong County, also abolished the regulations on deducting work points in the third and seventh teams. In order to increase the income of cooperative members, the cooperative management committee specially held a meeting and decided to actively develop pig raising. They also took into account the difficulties of cooperative members who could not afford or could not buy piglets and decided to give some of the cooperative's piglets to cooperative members to raise. They also sent people out to buy more piglets to give to cooperative members to raise, which would be repaid by cooperative members in the future.

    Many Party organizations believe that this discussion is specific, vivid, rapid, and timely. After the discussion, they learned methods for improving their leadership style. When arranging the discussion, the Yixing County Committee also summarized the exemplary deeds of Jiao Shunxiang, the production team leader of the Meiling Cooperative in the county, who promoted democracy and united cooperative members to engage in production, and distributed them to the branches and agricultural cooperatives to educate cooperative cadres on learning the correct leadership methods through comparisons of good and bad.

    江苏大力扭转农业社干部强迫命令的作风
    展开民主办社的大讨论
    本报讯　江苏省广大农村干部展开了关于“民主办社”的大讨论。这次讨论的第一阶段在八月四日结束，已经收到了初步的效果。不少社干部转变了强迫命令的作风，开始以民主的作风领导生产。
    “民主办社”，是农村中实现了合作化以后的一个重要问题。江苏省委在领导这一次讨论开始的时候，曾经指出：目前江苏全省已有76％的农户参加了高级社，农民把土地、耕牛、大型农具交给了社，把一切指望都放在社的身上。因此，他们指望社干部带领他们把社办好，能够发展生产，增加收入。同时，过去农民是各干各的，自顾自的，现在大家在一个大家庭里过日子，他们同样要求社员和社干部必须互相关心，互相尊重，特别是社干部要平等地对待人，公道地办事，带头做到民主、和睦、团结。这一个问题的迫切性，由于句容县发生贫农社员周德金上吊自杀的事件，更加尖锐和迫切地提了出来。省委抓紧了这一个惨痛的事件，通过南京新华日报，发动了“民主办社”的讨论。
    周德金是句容县岗子村农业社一个生产积极，为人老实的贫农社员，因为生产小队长王正福记工分不公平，周德金干活受了伤，又不分配轻活给他做。他曾和小队长争吵过几次，并向社监察委员会主任兼生产大队长陈义禄（共产党员）反映，要求调到别组工作。可是陈义禄却简单生硬地给他扣大帽子，责骂周德金同富农站在一条线上，又毫无根据地说他弄坏了村粮库门上的搭子，致使周德金误以为社里怀疑他有政治问题，因此而神经错乱，最后上吊自杀。
    这个事件发生以后，中共句容县委进行了深入的检查，报告省委。省委当时指出：“目前农村里像王正福、陈义禄这样的社干部，并不是个别的。他们对社会主义事业是热心的，是想把工作做好，他们并不是违法乱纪的坏人。但是，他们思想水平低，工作经验缺乏，特别是关心别人的命运不够，不能够将心比心地对待群众，因此，在工作中常常缺少正确的解决问题的办法，不自觉地用简单急躁的态度对待群众，甚至出口伤人，扣大帽子，把好事办坏。党对这类干部，不是简单地采用惩办的办法，而应该从爱护、团结出发，耐心教育他们，向他们讲清道理，帮助他们提高认识，改正错误，改进作风。”省委就在六月发出通知，要求全省党的农村支部，以句容县委关于周德金事件的检查报告为教材，广泛深入地进行民主办社的讨论和教育，通过阅读、漫谈和讨论的方法，启发社干部以自我反省、批评和自我批评的方法，来克服错误的工作作风和工作方法。省委书记刘顺元同志曾两次在省委扩大会上要求并布置各地委、市委、县委和村支部认真领导这一讨论，并注意发挥干部群众的积极性，办好农业社。中共苏州、松江、南通等地委和常熟、宝应等县委先后发出指示，要求各地党的基层组织，组织和领导党员和乡、社干部认真的参加民主办社的讨论。江苏人民广播电台、江都、宝山、句容等十九个县报、广播站也都展开了民主办社的宣传和讨论，报道当地讨论情况。常熟县各乡参加讨论的一般都有四百人左右。金坛、高邮等县党训班把“民主办社”讨论，作为重要的学习内容之一。从七月中旬开始到八月十日止，新华日报已收到参加民主办社讨论的稿件六百多件。
    这次讨论是通过说道理，论是非，树立榜样，提高基层干部的认识，推动干部自觉地改进思想和作风来进行的。现在新华日报已结束第一阶段的讨论。在第一阶段中，先后讨论了：“经济上限制不是强迫命令吗？”“不强迫命令能不能完成任务？”，“怎样对待落后社员？”等问题，主要批判强迫命令的思想和作风，宣传反复地、耐心地具体教育社员树立民主管理的思想和作风。第二阶段的讨论从八月四日开始，主要批判不按照民主管理的原则办社的错误思想和作风，宣传依靠群众智慧和力量办社的思想作风。以后主要讨论怎样把集体利益和个人利益正确结合起来，并针对产生强迫命令和不按照民主管理办社的原则，研究解决办法。
    这一讨论已收到初步的效果：参加讨论的党员干部普遍提高了思想，边学习边改进工作。例如句容县和平一社干部参加讨论以后，认识到乱扣工分是从经济上强制群众服从社委会决定的强迫命令行为，便把乱扣工分的各种规定取消。吴县保丰三社社主任曹阿大以前做工作态度很生硬，参加了乡支部组织的“民主办社”讨论以后，认识到强迫命令的危害，作风便有了改变，对社员的态度和蔼诚恳，作风细致深入，因此社员反映“好像换了一个新主任到我们社里来了”。南京市雨花台区江东蔬菜生产合作社第三分社从主任到二十三个生产队长都参加了讨论，他们对改进工作作风提出了七十四条合理化建议，并已开始用新作风来领导生产，社内在天气酷热的时候重新安排了劳动时间，早晚多做活，中午多休息。第二十一生产队徐仁海得到退还被乱扣的十五个工分以后，第二天早上两点钟就起床浇粪。滨海县潘荡区育才乡友好第二农业社的党员和社干部等六十三人，工作作风也有了明显的转变。如第六生产队长严加邦最近有一次派社员梅友成栽山芋，梅不愿去，严加邦改变了过去生硬的态度，耐心地说明道理，梅友成受到感动，愉快地接受了分配，并且他还到处对人说：“队长和和气气，我们生产可不能马马虎虎。”社员也发挥了积极性。句容县骆墅乡和平一社的干部们，经过学习，第三、第七等中队扣工分的规定也都取消了。为了增加社员的收入，社管委会专门开会研究，决定积极发展养猪，并照顾社员买不起或买不到小猪的困难，决定把社里的一部分小猪给社员养，还派人外出再买一部分小猪给社员养，将来由社员还本。
    许多党的组织都认为这次讨论具体、生动、迅速、及时，经过讨论学到了改进领导作风的办法。宜兴县委在布置讨论的时候，并总结了本县梅岭社生产队长焦顺祥发扬民主、团结社员搞生产的模范事例，发给支部和农业社，以好坏对比来教育社干部学会正确的领导方法。　（甄为民、乔云铸）
