    The Saying "Silkworms are Difficult to Raise in Summer" is Broken
    (Our dispatch) This year, Jiangsu Province distributed more than 7,000 summer silkworm seeds in more than 30 counties. Now, summer silkworm cocoons have generally appeared on the market.

    This year, the output of summer cocoons is generally about 30 to 40 jin per silkworm seed. The first production team of the 24th cooperative in Changan Township, Wuxi County, harvested 60 jin and 3 liang of cocoons from one silkworm seed. This breaks the farmer's long-held belief that silkworms are difficult to raise in summer.

    The price of summer cocoons this year is slightly higher than that of spring cocoons. The increase in cocoon prices has encouraged the enthusiasm of silkworm farmers for reproduction. After selling summer cocoons, silkworm farmers have ordered autumn silkworm seeds one after another.

    Rural supply and marketing cooperatives in major cocoon-producing areas have set up purchasing stations in key producing areas. In order to take care of situations with small quantities, wide distribution, and busy farming, they generally adopt the method of scheduled fixed-point mobile purchasing, which is very popular among farmers.

    “夏天不好养蚕”的说法打破了
    本报讯　江苏省今年在三十多个县发放了七千多张夏蚕种，现在，夏蚕茧已普遍登场了。
    今年夏茧产量一般每张蚕种可产三十到四十斤左右，无锡县长安乡第二十四社第一生产队所养的一张蚕种，结了六十斤零三两茧子。打破了农民一向认为夏天不好养蚕的说法。
    今年夏茧的价格比春茧又提高了一些。茧价的提高，鼓舞了蚕农再生产的积极性，蚕农卖掉夏茧以后，纷纷订购秋蚕种。
    各产茧地的农村供销合作社，已在重点产区设了收购站，为了照顾量少、面广、农忙等情况，一般都采用了约期定点流动收购的方法，农民很欢迎。　（李锡荣）
