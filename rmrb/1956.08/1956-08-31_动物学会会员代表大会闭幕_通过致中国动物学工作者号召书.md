Xinhua News Agency report: The Second National Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Zoological Society, held in Qingdao, concluded on the 28th.

This congress received a total of fifty papers on zoological theory and animal surveys. Twenty-three of these papers were read and discussed at the congress.

The congress clarified that in the next few years, zoological research should prioritize the investigation and research of animal geographic regions, and the work on animal geographic regions should be combined with resource surveys. In addition, zoological work related to agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, breeding, and aquaculture, as well as the basic theoretical work of zoology itself, should also be initiated.

In addition: The Second National Member Representative Congress of the Chinese Zoological Society passed a letter of appeal, hoping that Chinese zoologists would unite and do everything possible to complete the task of developing science. It also called on Chinese zoologists abroad and in Taiwan to return as soon as possible to jointly build the motherland.

The letter of appeal stated: An incomparably broad prospect for scientific development lies before us. The "1956-1967 National Science and Technology Development Long-Range Plan Outline" (draft) has been initially prepared, and it will guide the future development of zoological science in China, thereby accelerating the construction of the motherland.

The letter of appeal stated: Chinese zoologists abroad! Colleagues in Taiwan engaged in zoological work! Our great motherland is becoming more prosperous and powerful day by day, and we will be happier. However, the people of the motherland demand more from us. We and the people of the whole country sincerely hope that you will return as soon as possible to jointly build a happy, prosperous, and strong motherland.
