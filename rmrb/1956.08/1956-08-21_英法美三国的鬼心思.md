The Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company on July 26, guaranteeing the freedom of navigation in the canal. Egypt's measures are entirely reasonable. This is a matter that a sovereign state has full power to handle, and no outsider should "make carping comments" about it.

The sovereignty of this canal has always belonged to Egypt. It was dug by the Egyptian people themselves through more than ten years of labor and the sacrifice of many precious lives. Unfortunately, from the day the canal company was established, for nearly a century, all rights have been forcibly plundered by countries such as Britain and France. From 1870 to 1930, they had already seized 3.5 billion gold francs; in 1927 alone, Britain obtained a profit of 1.55 million pounds. This is a typical example of some countries enslaving and exploiting other countries, which is absolutely contrary to reason and can be said to be no different from the behavior of robbers. Now that the master has stood up and taken back what was stolen from the plunderers, they should bow their heads, admit their guilt, and quickly offer it with both hands. What else is there to say?

However, what is the attitude of countries such as Britain, France, and the United States? For the past half month, the three capitals of London, Paris, and Washington have been in chaos, engaging in intense activities, creating a murky atmosphere. Some convened emergency cabinet meetings with the heads of the army, navy, and air force participating, while others issued rude and impolite "protests" to the Egyptian government; this was immediately followed by freezing Egypt's foreign exchange deposits, shouting for economic blockade, and clamoring for military intervention. Sure enough, Britain ordered its armed forces to enter a state of alert on July 31, France declared that it was "taking all measures" to protect French interests in Egypt, and the United States stated that it was "conducting urgent consultations with other relevant governments." They even declared that they would form a joint military command, attempting to create an international tense situation of "the mountain is about to be covered by rain, and the wind is filling the building" to threaten Egypt. Isn't this set of stale tricks extremely boring? Isn't it making trouble out of nothing?

What is even more ridiculous is that the markets in London, Paris, and New York also followed suit, with stock prices falling and gold prices rising. Isn't this just the capitalists in London, Paris, and New York going against each other? Because whether gold rises or stocks fall, since some people make a lot of money, some people will suffer a great loss. In the end, it is just "fools troubling themselves."

Seeing that the set of threats and intimidation was not necessarily effective, the leaders of Britain, France, and the United States, after all-day and all-night summit meetings, issued a joint communique on August 2, insisting that the Suez Canal Company was an "international institution" and that an international conference should be held in London to discuss the future of the Suez Canal. The purpose was to turn the canal into "international control" in form, but in substance, it would still be controlled by Britain, France, and the United States. This is an evil intention to use international forces to oppress Egypt, to damage Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, and to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. Of course, one hand cannot cover the sky, and it will be criticized by people of justice.

People cannot help but ask: The Suez Canal, as Egyptian territory, the Thames River, as British territory, the Seine River, as French territory, and the Hudson River, as American territory, although they differ in their geographical location, what is the difference in the meaning of the word "territory"? If someone now proposes to hold an international conference to discuss the future of the Thames River, the Seine River, and the Hudson River, and proposes a plan for "international control," what would the leaders of Britain, France, and the United States think of such a proposal, would they welcome it or protest it?

Therefore, I hope that the leaders of Britain, France, and the United States will think about the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company by the Egyptian government from the other's perspective, first thinking about themselves, and then thinking about others, treating others as they would like to be treated themselves, and they will feel at ease; otherwise, they will only be asking for trouble, making themselves a laughingstock in the world, and making themselves even more isolated.

    英法美三国的鬼心思
    资耀华
    埃及政府七月二十六日宣布把苏彝士运河公司国有化的时候，就保证了运河航行的自由。埃及的措施，完全是合情合理的。这是一个主权国家自己有全权处理的事，任何外人都不应该“啧有烦言”的。
    这条运河的主权一直是属于埃及，是埃及人民耗费了十多年的劳动力、牺牲了很多的宝贵生命亲手开凿成的。不幸，从运河公司成立那一天起，近百年来，全部权利都被英、法等国强力掠夺了去。从1870年到1930年，它们已经夺取了三十五亿金法郎；1927年一年，英国就获得了一百五十五万英镑的利润。这正是一些国家奴役剥削另外一些国家的典型例子，是绝对违背情理的，也可以说是同强盗的行为并没有什么两样。现在主人站起来了，从掠夺者手里把过去被抢走的东西收回来，他们就应该俯首认罪赶快双手奉献出来才是道理，还有什么别的话好说呢？
    然而，英、法、美等国的态度却怎样呢？半月来，伦敦、巴黎、华盛顿三个首都就陷于混乱，紧张地进行活动，闹得乌烟瘴气。有的召开有陆海空三军首脑人参加的紧急内阁会议，有的向埃及政府提出粗暴无礼貌的“抗议”；紧接着就是冻结埃及的外汇存款，叫喊经济封锁，大呼军事干涉。果然，英国于七月三十一日就下令三军进入戒备状态，法国宣称正在“采取一切措施”以保护法国在埃及的利益，美国表示“正在同其他有关的政府进行紧急的协商”。它们甚至宣称要组成联合军司令部，企图造成“山雨欲来风满楼”的国际紧张局势来威胁埃及。这一套陈腐的把戏，是不是无聊之极吗？是不是无理取闹吗？
    还有更可笑的，就是在伦敦、巴黎、纽约市场上，也跟着起哄，股票行市下落，黄金价格上涨，这又是不是伦敦、巴黎、纽约资本家们自己人同自己人过不去呢？因为无论黄金上涨也好，股票下落也好，既然有人赚大钱，就要有人吃大亏，闹来闹去，不过是“庸人自扰”罢了。
    看到威胁恐吓这一套把戏不一定灵验，英、法、美三国经过整天整夜的首脑会议后，于八月二日又发出联合公报，硬说苏彝士运河公司是一个“国际机构”，要在伦敦召开一个国际会议来讨论苏彝士运河的前途问题，目的就是想把这条运河弄成形式上是“国际管制”，实质上依然由英、法、美来把持。这是一个想利用国际力量来压迫埃及的鬼心思，想损害埃及的主权和尊严，干涉埃及的内政。当然一手不能遮天，是要遭到正义人士的指责的。
    人们不禁要问：作为埃及领土的苏彝士运河，作为英国领土的泰晤士河，作为法国领土的塞纳河，作为美国领土的赫德逊河，它们在地域的位置上虽然有所不同，但在“领土”这两个字的意义上有什么两样呢？假使现在有人主张开一个国际会议，来讨论泰晤士河、塞纳河、赫德逊河的前途问题，并提出“国际管制”的方案，试问英、法、美三国首脑对这样的提案要作何感想，是欢迎呢还是抗议呢？
    所以，我希望英、法、美三国的首脑们，对于埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司国有化这件事，要设身处地的想一想，先想想自己，再想想人家，将心比心，认识到己所不欲，勿施于人，就会心安理得；否则，它们只会是自找苦恼，遗笑于天下，而使自己更加陷于孤立。
