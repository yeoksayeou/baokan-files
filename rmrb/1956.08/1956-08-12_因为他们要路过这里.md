    Because They Have to Pass Through Here
    The Shigou Gou mining area primary school for workers' children in Inner Mongolia has only one rather small toilet for one hundred and fifty female students. Unfortunately, on July 29th of this year, this not-very-large women's toilet was also demolished. The people who demolished the toilet were Secretary Zhang of the Baotou Coal Mine Preparatory Office Party Committee, the Chief of the Administrative Section, the Chief of the Security Section, and the Director of the Office. Their dormitories are on the hillside behind the school, and they have to pass by this toilet when they come and go. They disliked that the road was not easy to walk and that the toilet had a foul odor, so they ordered the toilet to be demolished and used the bricks from the toilet to pave the road.
    On the day the toilet was demolished, the school's clerk raised an objection, but they said: This is a decision made by our office. Shuguang

    因为他们要路过这里
    内蒙古石拐沟矿区职工子弟小学校一百五十个女学生，只有一个不很大的厕所。可惜在今年七月二十九日，这个不很大的女厕所也被拆毁了。拆毁厕所的人，是包头煤矿筹备处的党委张书记，行政科长、保卫科长和办公室主任等。他们的宿舍就在学校后边的山坡上，来往要经过这一厕所旁边。他们嫌路不好走，厕所有臭味，就下令拆除厕所，用厕所的砖石铺道。
    拆厕所的那天，学校的事务员曾提出意见，但他们却说：这是我们处里决定的。　曙光
