Since the second quarter of 1953, certain aspects of the British economy have shown a new upward trend. British industrial production increased by 5.9% in 1953, 7.4% in 1954, and about 5% last year. The level of export volume increased by about 14.3% from 1952 to last year. From 1952 to 1954, Britain's international balance of payments continued to have a considerable surplus for two years (totaling 344 million pounds), and gold and dollar reserves also increased from 1.8 billion US dollars at the end of 1952 to 2.7 billion US dollars at the end of 1954. The number of employed people in Britain has also increased in the past few years.

However, since the fourth quarter of 1954, the British economy has begun to show signs of a new crisis. This new crisis is first manifested in the sharp increase in the foreign trade deficit, and the problem of foreign trade has become extremely acute due to the rapid expansion of domestic currency. Last year, although industrial production, domestic market capacity, and employment continued to expand, the foreign trade situation deteriorated sharply again. According to official British statistics, last year Britain's export value increased by 8.5% (export volume increased by 7%), while import value increased by 15% (import volume increased by 12%). The trade deficit was as high as 862 million pounds, the highest figure since 1952. As a result, Britain's international balance of payments showed a deficit of 103 million pounds last year for the first time since 1952. In the past year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves shrank by 642 million US dollars, reaching the lowest point since 1953 (420 million US dollars), only 120 million US dollars away from the officially so-called "danger point."

At the same time, the inflation situation is becoming increasingly serious. The amount of pound sterling in circulation has increased from 437 million pounds in 1937 to 1.37 billion pounds in 1952, and reached as high as 1.73 billion pounds at the end of last year. In the past year alone, retail prices in Britain rose by 9%, and fuel prices in wholesale prices also rose by 13%. The cost of living rose by about 6%. This situation affects the prices of export goods, making it more difficult for British goods to be sold in the world market.

The causes of this crisis are as follows:

First, the main reason is the result of economic militarization and abnormal expansion. The rise in British industrial production in the past few years has been mainly due to the expansion of armaments and war preparations, the investment boom in renovating industrial equipment, and the credit expansion that stimulated people's purchase of goods on credit. Since the 1951 fiscal year, Britain's direct military expenditure has doubled, from 770 million pounds to an unprecedented peak of more than 1.5 billion pounds in the previous fiscal year. The expansion of armaments and war preparations and the technological innovation carried out to cope with foreign competition have triggered a wave of fixed capital investment. From 1952 to 1955, British fixed capital investment increased by 31%. Like the United States, British monopoly capitalists are also desperately encouraging people to purchase goods on credit, and consumer credit reached 600 to 700 million pounds at the end of last year. The expansion of armaments and war preparations, the addition of industrial equipment, and purchases on credit have expanded the demand for machinery and equipment and durable consumer goods. In fact, this is the foundation of this rise. However, such an expansion of the domestic market has had two consequences: on the one hand, it has greatly increased imports, thus expanding the foreign trade deficit. For example, last year the import value of coal and steel was 170 million pounds, accounting for about one-fifth of Britain's trade deficit last year. On the other hand, it has had a restrictive effect on exports, weakening Britain's export capacity and making the situation worse. Some important products are piling up and cannot be sold. For example, between 1954 and 1955, Britain's automobile production increased by 20%, domestic sales increased by 39%, while exports increased by only 3%. The export volume of other important export commodities continued to decline. For example, the export of cotton textiles in 1955 decreased by about 12% compared with 1954.

Secondly, there is the intensification of competition in the international market and the measures taken by some countries to restrict imports. The British government's continued pursuit of the US policy of "embargo" against socialist countries has also restricted Britain's own opportunities to expand new markets. The terms of Britain's foreign trade last year (the comparison of import and export prices) were also unfavorable to Britain. Between 1952 and 1954, Britain benefited from a decrease in import prices and the relative stability of export prices, gaining 500 million pounds. Last year, the situation was different. Trade conditions began to be unfavorable to Britain. Within one year, the price of British imports rose by 3%, while the price of exports rose by only 2%. A comparison of export changes between Britain and other industrialized countries shows the weakening of Britain's position in the world market. Last year, Britain's exports of industrial products increased by 5% compared with the previous year, but the exports of industrial products from eleven other industrialized countries increased by an average of 13%.

In order to prevent the development of domestic inflation and increase exports, the British government took measures last year such as raising bank interest rates, restricting bank credit and consumer credit, and also proposed a "tighten the belt" supplementary autumn budget. All these measures did not touch on the main reasons for Britain's economic difficulties, but only further lowered the people's living standards, so it was impossible to solve the difficulties encountered by the British economy. As a result, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler was transferred. At the beginning of this year, the Conservative government implemented a series of new measures to deal with the crisis. The main contents of these measures are as follows:

(1) The bank interest rate was raised again to 5.5%, reaching the highest interest rate level since 1931.

(2) The number of initial payments that people must pay when buying goods by installment payment is further increased.

(3) Government subsidies for bread prices were reduced, and milk prices were increased.

(4) Investment subsidies to encourage industries to start new basic projects were stopped, and investment in state-owned industries was reduced.

(5) New municipal construction plans for local governments and new school construction plans were postponed, and the expenses of government non-military departments and school construction were reduced.

These anti-crisis measures taken by the Conservative government actually have no new content. Their general spirit is still to increase exports by reducing wages, restricting people's consumption, and ensuring the profits of capitalists. In order to cover up the attack on the living standards of the working people, the British ruling group has repeatedly publicized that Britain's economic difficulties are mainly due to wages increasing too fast and workers buying too many things, which restricts exports and causes inflation. In fact, this is unfounded. Since 1947, although there has been growth in production, there has been no increase in the real income of workers. Although the amount of wages has increased due to the continuous struggle of the British working class, the cost of living index has also increased in the same way, and the price index of food, which accounts for the main part of the working people's expenses, has risen faster than wages.

In fact, the main problem is the burden placed on the British economy by long-term expansion of armaments and heavy overseas military obligations. Britain could basically solve its current difficulties if it could reduce its current level of military spending by half. Taking the international balance of payments crisis as an example, the total deficit last year was 103 million pounds, but overseas military expenditure last year was as high as 157 million pounds.

The British economic situation in the first few months of this year proves that some of the measures taken by the new British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan, like those taken by his predecessor, cannot fundamentally solve the problem.

On the surface, Britain's foreign trade situation in the first half of this year seems to have improved somewhat compared with the same period last year. Exports increased faster than imports compared with the same period last year; the trade deficit was more than 300 million pounds, a decrease of more than one-third compared with the same period last year. This has given Britain a surplus of 100 million pounds in its international balance of payments. But as long as you study it carefully, the situation is still not optimistic.

First of all, although the value of British exports in the first half of this year increased by 14% compared with the same period last year, most of this was not due to an increase in the actual quantity of exports, but due to some other reasons, such as the rise in the price of export goods this year, the decrease in exports in the first half of last year due to strikes in the transportation industry, and the inclusion of a considerable loan to the United States in exports in the first half of this year. According to estimates by the British Ministry of Trade, the actual export volume in the first half of this year was only 6% more than the same period last year. This is the same as the average increase in the previous two years, and lower than the increase last year. It can be seen that the increase in the first half of this year does not indicate any obvious improvement in the export situation.

Secondly, although British industrial production stagnated in the first few months of this year, the consumption of domestic civilian durable goods decreased sharply, and the import of agricultural products was reduced, British imports did not decrease, but increased further. This fact proves that as long as the large-scale expansion of armaments continues, it is difficult to reduce imports.

Third, one of the reasons for the reduction in Britain's trade deficit this year is the favorable change in trade conditions for Britain. Import prices have not increased as fast as export prices, and some imports have even fallen in price. However, the imports that have fallen the most in price are all products from overseas countries in the sterling area (such as rubber, tin, and jute). This price drop will in turn affect Britain's exports to these countries and will affect the increase in the sterling area's gold and dollar reserves.

Fourth, although Britain's gold and dollar reserves have increased this year, the amount of reserves is still at a very low level, even much lower than in 1953. Since there have been considerable increases in Britain's industrial production and foreign trade for more than two years, this level is obviously far from enough.

These measures by the government have also failed to weaken the further development of inflation. The cost of living index in Britain has risen by 3% in the first few months of this year. In May of this year, the prices of coal, utilities, vegetables, potatoes, etc. in Britain all rose significantly. The official British estimate originally believed that the rise in the cost of living this year would average about 2% to 3%, but business people now believe that the cost of living in Britain this year will increase by 5% to 6% compared to last year.

Due to the stagnation of industrial production and the continued development of inflation, the position of the pound sterling has been weakened. On June 26 of this year, the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the US dollar in the London Stock Exchange fell below parity (i.e., one pound equals 2.8 US dollars) for the first time since November 1 of last year. Many Western European countries have sold off the pound sterling in large quantities in exchange for other currencies (mainly the US dollar). As a result, the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the currencies of most Western European countries has also fallen. Therefore, speculations about another devaluation of the pound sterling have appeared again.

The situation has become so critical that British Prime Minister Eden has recently repeatedly sounded the alarm to the British people, emphasizing that the export crisis and inflation are the most direct and vital threats facing Britain today. Facts have proved that the economic policy of draining the pond to catch all the fish, which the British government has always adopted, not only cannot solve Britain's economic problems, but has deepened the factors of the crisis. The people who formulate British economic policy now have to start facing reality, admitting that British economic problems cannot be solved without reducing the heavy burden of armaments, and believe that expanding trade between the East and the West is necessary. In this way, people see that the British government has recently decided to cut this year's military expenditure by 50 million pounds, and has used the so-called "exception procedure" on the "embargo" issue. However, 50 million pounds is only a fraction of Britain's huge military expenditure, and the half-hearted practice of invoking the "exception procedure" is far from enough to solve the problem that Britain must seek vast new markets in the face of increasingly fierce competition in the capitalist world market. The real way out of the current British economic predicament lies in fundamentally abandoning the harmful "cold war" policy, drastically reducing armaments and overseas military activities, and at the same time kicking away the "embargo" and fully developing peaceful trade relations with socialist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    英国经济目前的问题
    谢曜
    1953年第二季以后，英国经济的某些方面出现了上升的新趋向。英国的工业生产在1953年增加了5.9％，1954年增加了7.4％，去年又增加了5％左右。出口实物量的水平从1952年至去年上升了约14.3％。从1952年至1954年，英国的国际收支继续两年都有相当的顺差（总数达三亿四千四百万镑），黄金美元储备也从1952年底的十八亿美元增加到1954年底的二十七亿美元。英国的就业人数在过去几年中也有了增加。
    但自1954年第四季起，英国的经济就已开始出现新的危机的征象。这个新的危机首先又是在对外贸易逆差急剧增加上表现出来，而对外贸易的问题又因为国内通货的急速膨胀而变得异常地尖锐。去年，尽管工业生产、国内市场的容量和就业方面还在继续扩大，对外贸易的情况却又急剧地恶化起来。按照英国官方的统计，去年英国的出口值虽然增加了8.5％（出口实物量增加了7％），而进口值却增加了15％（进口实物量增加12％）。贸易逆差高达八亿六千二百万镑，是1952年以来最高的数字。结果，去年英国的国际收支从1952年以来首次出现了一亿零三百万镑的逆差。在去年一年里面，英国的黄金美元储备缩减了六亿四千二百万美元，达到了1953年以来的最低点（四亿二千万美元），距官方所谓的“危险点”只差了一亿二千万美元。
    同时，通货膨胀情况也愈来愈严重了。英镑的流通量自1937年的四亿三千七百万镑增加到1952年的十三亿七千万镑，去年年底，竟高达十七亿三千万镑。单在去年一年内，英国的零售价格就上升了9％，批发价格中的燃料价格也上升了13％。生活费用上升了6％左右。这种情况影响出口货的价格，从而使英国货在世界市场上销售更为困难。
    造成这次危机的原因有下列两个方面：
    首先，主要的是经济军事化和畸形膨胀的结果。过去几年中英国工业生产的上升，主要是由于扩军备战，革新工业设备的投资热潮，以及刺激人民赊购货物的信用膨胀。从1951年度以来，英国的直接军费已增加了一倍，从七亿七千万镑增加到上年度的十五亿镑以上的空前高峰。扩军备战和为了应付国外竞争而进行的技术革新引起了固定资本投资的浪潮。从1952到1955年，英国固定资本投资增加了31％。像美国一样，英国垄断资本家也拚命鼓励人民赊购货物，消费者信用去年年底已高达六、七亿镑。扩军备战，增添工业设备和赊购，扩大了对机器设备和耐用消费品的需求。事实上，这也就是这次上升的基础。但这样扩大国内市场，造成了两方面的后果：一方面大大增加了进口，因而扩大了对外贸易的逆差。例如，去年煤炭和钢铁的进口值一亿七千万镑，占英国去年贸易逆差的约五分之一。另一方面，产生了限制出口的作用，削弱了英国的出口能力，使情况愈来愈坏。有些重要的产品积压起来，销不出去。例如，在1954—1955年间，英国的汽车产量增加了20％，国内销售量增加了39％，而输出额却仅增加了3％。另外一些重要出口商品，外销量继续降低，例如，棉织品的出口，1955年比1954年又减少了约12％。
    其次，就是国际市场上竞争的加剧和一些国家采取了限制入口的措施。英国政府继续追随美国执行对社会主义国家的“禁运”又限制了英国自己扩大新市场的机会。去年的英国对外贸易的条件（进出口价格的对比）也是对英国不利的。在1952年至1954年间，由于进口价格下降和出口价格的相对稳定，英国曾得到了五亿英镑的好处。去年的情况不同，贸易条件开始对英国不利，一年内英国的进口货价格上升了3％，而出口货仅只上升2％。从英国和其他工业国家出口变化的比较可以看出英国在世界市场上地位的削弱。去年英国工业品的出口虽然比前年增加了5％，但其他十一个工业发达的国家的工业品出口却平均增加了13％。
    为了阻止国内通货膨胀的发展和增加出口，英国政府在去年就采取了提高银行利率、限制银行信贷和消费信贷等办法，还提出了一个“束紧裤带”的秋季补充预算。所有这一切措施，都未触及英国经济困难的主要原因，而只是进一步降低人民生活水平，因此不可能解决英国经济所遭遇的困境。结果是前财政大臣巴特勒调职。今年初，保守党政府实施了一系列新的措施来对付危机。这些措施的主要内容如下：
    （一）将银行利率再提高到5.5％，达到了1931年以来的最高利率水平。
    （二）再增加人民用分期付款办法购买货物时必须交付的最初付款数目。
    （三）削减政府对面包价格的补贴，并提高牛奶的价格。
    （四）停止给予鼓励工业开始新的基本工程的投资补助，同时减少国营工业的投资。
    （五）推迟地方政府新的市政建设计划和建筑学校的新计划，削减政府非军事部门和学校建筑的费用。
    保守党政府这一些反危机的措置实际上没有什么新的内容，它们的总的精神仍然是要用削减工资，限制人民消费，保证资本家利润的办法来增加出口。为了掩护对劳动人民生活水平的进攻，英国统治集团一再宣传说，英国经济困难主要是由于工资增加得太快，工人买东西太多，结果就限制了出口和造成了通货膨胀。实际上，这是毫无根据的。自1947年以来，尽管生产有了增长，工人的实际收入却并没有什么增加。虽然由于英国工人阶级不断的斗争，工资数额有所增加，但生活费用的指数也有着同样的增加，而占劳动人民开支的主要部分的食物的价格指数，上升得比工资要快。
    事实上，主要的问题是长期扩张军备和沉重的海外军事义务加于英国经济的负担。英国只要能够把目前的军费水平减少一半，目前的困难情况就基本上能解决。以国际支付平衡危机为例，去年总逆差为一亿零三百万镑，但去年的海外军事开支就高达一亿五千七百万镑。
    今年最初几个月的英国经济情况，证明了英国新任财政大臣麦克米伦采取的一些措施，和他前任所采取过的一样，并不能根本解决问题。
    表面上看来，英国今年上半年的对外贸易情况似乎比去年同期有了若干改进。出口和去年同期相比增加得比进口要快些；贸易逆差为三亿多镑，比去年同期减少了三分之一以上。这使得英国的国际收支有了一亿镑的赢余。但只要仔细地研究一下，情况是仍然不能乐观的。
    首先，今年上半年英国出口值虽然比去年同期增加了14％，但这大部分并非出口实际数量的增加，而是由于一些其他原因，如今年出口货价格的上升、去年上半年的出口因运输业的罢工而减少以及今年上半年出口中包括偿还美国的一笔为数可观的贷款等。据英国贸易部估计，今年上半年实际出口量比去年同期不过多6％。这和前两年平均增加额一样，而比去年增加额还要低些。由此可见今年上半年的增加并不表明出口情况有了什么明显的改进。
    其次，尽管今年头几个月英国的工业生产停滞不前，国内民用耐用品的消费量急剧减少，并且减少了农产品的输入，但英国的进口还是没有减少，而是进一步增加了。这个事实证明，只要继续大量扩充军备，进口是很难缩减的。
    第三，英国今年贸易逆差减少的原因之一是由于贸易条件的有利于英国的变化。进口货价格增加得不如出口货快，而且有些进口货还跌了价。但进口货跌价最多的都是英镑区海外各国的产品（如橡胶、锡、黄麻等），这种跌价反过来会影响英国对这些国家的出口，并将影响英镑区黄金美元储备的增加。
    第四，英国的黄金美元储备今年虽然有所增长，但储备的数量依然处于很低的水平，甚至比1953年还少得多。由于二年多来英国的工业生产和对外贸易都有不少增加，这个水平显然是远远不够的。
    政府这些措置也没有能削弱通货膨胀的进一步发展。英国今年头几个月的生活费用指数已上升了3％。今年五月，英国的煤炭、公用事业、蔬菜、马铃薯等等的价格都有了显著的上涨。英国的官方估计本来认为今年生活费用的上升平均约在2％到3％之间，但目前商界人士认为今年英国的生活费用将比去年增长5％到6％。
    由于工业生产停滞不前和通货膨胀继续发展，英镑的地位已日益削弱。今年六月二十六日伦敦交易所中的英镑对美元的汇率，又从去年十一月一日以来第一次下降到平价（即一镑合2.8美元）之下。许多西欧国家都大批抛出英镑来换取其他货币（主要是美元）。结果，连英镑同大多数西欧国家货币的汇率也都降低。因此关于英镑再一次贬值的推测又出现了。
    情况的危急到了这种程度，以至英国首相艾登最近一再向英国人发出警号，强调出口危机和通货膨胀是英国当前最直接和生死攸关的威胁。事实证明，英国政府历来采取的那种竭泽而渔的经济政策不仅不能解决英国经济的问题，反而加深了危机的因素。英国经济政策的制定人们现在不得不开始正视现实，承认若不减轻沉重的军备负担，英国经济问题就无法解决，并且认为扩大东西方的贸易是必要的。这样，人们就看到最近英国政府决定削减本年度军费五千万镑，并且在“禁运”问题上运用了所谓“例外程序”。但是五千万镑不过是英国庞大军事开支的一个零头，而援引“例外程序”这种半心半意的作法也远不足以解决英国在遭遇资本主义世界市场上日益猛烈的竞争之下必须寻求广大的新市场的问题。解脱目前英国经济困境的真正出路在于根本抛弃有害的“冷战”政策，大量裁减军备和海外军事活动，同时踢开“禁运”，在平等互利的基础上充分发展同社会主义国家的和平贸易关系。
