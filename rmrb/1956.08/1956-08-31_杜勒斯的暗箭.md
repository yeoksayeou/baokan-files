    Dulles's Dagger
    Feng Zhidan
    The London Conference had just ended, and the American propaganda machine immediately launched a massive attack on the Soviet Union, insisting that Egypt's refusal to accept the "international control" plan for the Suez Canal was the result of Soviet instigation. At a press conference on August 28, Dulles indicated that he was the mastermind behind this propaganda attack. He said that at the London Conference, "only the Soviet Union showed itself to be a country that did not want to find a way to achieve a peaceful solution." According to Dulles, this was because the Soviet Union opposed "the plan he proposed," and the Soviet Union believed that this "Dulles Plan" "was merely a trick to reimpose colonialism on Egypt." According to Dulles, the reason Egypt was unwilling to accept the "Dulles Plan" was also due to the "propaganda" the Soviet Union conducted among the Arabs, and so on.
    It is well known that Dulles harbored a great deal of resentment because the London Conference did not vote to pass his plan. He vented this resentment entirely on the Soviet Union, with extremely malicious intentions. He thought that by this method, he could easily shift the responsibility for the peace-damaging actions taken by the United States, Britain, and France to force Egypt to accept the "Dulles Plan" onto the Soviet Union. He thought that through this propaganda, he could confuse the Egyptian people, making it seem as if the United States was hostile not to Egypt but to the Soviet Union. In this way, the United States could provoke a rift between Egypt and the Soviet Union, isolating Egypt in order to force it to accept the "Dulles Plan."
    It can be seen that Dulles's arrow, which is ostensibly aimed at the Soviet Union, is actually a dagger aimed at the Egyptian people. No matter how much Dulles secretly shouts: Good arrow, good arrow, Dulles's archery skills are really not very good. This arrow neither hit the Soviet Union nor the Egyptian people.
    The matter is very clear: the Soviet Union was not the only country that opposed the "Dulles Plan" at the London Conference. Dulles does not dare to openly scold India, Indonesia, and Ceylon, which hold the same opposing attitude, which is his only option, but that does not mean that he has not offended these Asian countries that uphold justice. Moreover, Dulles's arrow also shot out a result that he was extremely unwilling to see, that is, he personally proved that the Soviet Union is opposed to colonialism and is a friend of the people of all countries striving for independence and freedom. Moreover, India, Indonesia, and Ceylon, which hold the same attitude as the Soviet Union, are also active fighters against colonialism.
  　If one knew how much Dulles himself wanted to wear this crown of anti-colonialism, one would understand how great a loss this arrow brought to himself.
    As for the Egyptian people, they will not be grateful to Dulles for reminding them of the influence of Soviet "propaganda." On the contrary, they will not let go of the colonialist smell in Dulles's words. Colonialists have never believed that oppressed people can have their own wisdom. Dulles does not believe that the Egyptian people have their own will, their own sense of smell, and vision; therefore, he believes that the actions of the Egyptian people depend on Soviet "propaganda." Dulles and other American colonialists treat the Egyptian people as fools, as ignorant and uncultured people. It is with this view that, some time ago, when Egypt accused Western countries of "collective colonialism," the American propaganda machine said that this accusation was something the Egyptians could not have thought of; it must have been thought up by people who came from the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that the Egyptian people will make their own judgments about this argument of American colonialists who despise the Egyptian people.
    The Egyptian people are becoming more and more vigilant and experienced in their struggle against colonialism. Dulles firing a dagger at such people is tantamount to suicide.

    杜勒斯的暗箭
    冯之丹
    伦敦会议刚结束，美国宣传机器立刻对苏联大肆攻击，硬说埃及不接受“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划是苏联煽动的结果。在8月28日的记者招待会上，杜勒斯表明他是这种宣传攻击的主使人。他说，在伦敦会议上“只有苏联表现出是一个不想寻找实现和平解决的办法的国家。”据杜勒斯说，这是因为苏联反对他“所提出的计划”，苏联认为，这个“杜勒斯计划”“只是一个把殖民主义重新加于埃及身上的伎俩”。据杜勒斯说，埃及之所以不愿接受这个“杜勒斯计划”，也就是由于苏联在阿拉伯人中间进行了“宣传”，云云。　　杜勒斯因为伦敦会议没有投票通过他的计划而怀着一肚子的怨气，这是谁都知道的事情。他把这股怨气完全发泄到苏联身上，是有着十分恶毒的打算的。他以为，用这个办法，就可以把美、英、法为了迫使埃及接受“杜勒斯计划”而采取的破坏和平的行动的责任，轻易地推在苏联身上。他以为，通过这种宣传，可以迷惑埃及人民，似乎美国所敌视的并不是埃及而是苏联。这样，美国就可以挑拨埃及和苏联之间的关系，使埃及陷于孤立，以便于强迫埃及接受“杜勒斯计划”。
    可见，杜勒斯这支表面上射向苏联的箭，实际上是射向埃及人民的一支暗箭。不管杜勒斯暗地里在叫：好箭，好箭，但是杜勒斯的射箭技术，实在并不高明。他这支箭既没有射中苏联，也没有射中埃及人民。　　　　　　　
    事情很清楚，在伦敦会议上反对“杜勒斯计划”的并不只苏联一国。杜勒斯不敢公开责骂抱同样反对态度的印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰，正是他的不得已处，但是并不因此他就不得罪了这些坚持正义的亚洲国家。而且，杜勒斯这一箭，还射出了他极不愿意有的一个结果，这就是他亲口证明了苏联是反对殖民主义的，是争取独立自由的各国人民的朋友。而且，和苏联抱同样态度的印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰，也都是反殖民主义的积极的战士。
  　如果知道杜勒斯自己是多么想戴上这顶反殖民主义的桂冠，就可以明白他这一箭给他自己带来的损失是多么大。
    至于埃及人民，他们对于杜勒斯提醒他们苏联“宣传”的影响是不会感激的。相反，杜勒斯的这些话里的殖民主义的气味，他们倒不会放过。殖民主义者从来都不认为被压迫的人民能有自己的智慧。杜勒斯不相信埃及人民有自己的意志、自己的嗅觉和视觉，因此他认为埃及人民的行动取决于苏联的“宣传”。杜勒斯之流的美国殖民主义者把埃及人民都当作是傻子，是愚蠢而没有文化的人。正是抱着这种看法，前些时候，埃及指责西方的“集体殖民主义”，美国宣传机器就说，这种指责埃及人是想不出来的，一定是从苏联去的人给想出来的。毫无疑问，对于美国殖民主义者这种蔑视埃及人民的论调，埃及人民是会作出自己的判断的。
    埃及人民在同殖民主义者作斗争中，正在锻炼得越来越机警而且老练。杜勒斯向这样的人民放暗箭，就等于自杀。
