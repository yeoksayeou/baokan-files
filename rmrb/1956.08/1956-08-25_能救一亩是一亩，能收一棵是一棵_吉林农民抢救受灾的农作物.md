    "Save every mu you can, harvest every stalk you can"
    Jilin Farmers Rush to Rescue Disaster-Stricken Crops
    (Our newspaper's Changchun dispatch, August 24th) Currently, the floodwaters in Jilin Province have receded, and Party and government leading organs at all levels are taking various measures to lead disaster-stricken people in self-salvation through production. Under the slogan of "Save every mu you can, harvest every stalk you can," farmers across the province are rescuing crops on over 710,000 hectares of land that have suffered varying degrees of disaster. By August 20th, floodwaters had been drained from over 220,000 hectares of land, and field management had been strengthened. After the Qianfeng and Qianming agricultural cooperatives in Kouqian District, Yongji County, were hit by the disaster, they organized more than 2,000 people who spent two days using their hands to prop up over 120 hectares of fallen crops. These crops are now growing very well. In Nong'an County, mountainous areas are also adding soil to the base of more than 1,500 hectares of sorghum and corn to promote the early maturity of the crops.
    In order to support farmers in disaster areas in their production, the Jilin Provincial People's Committee allocated more than 3,500 tons of late-season seeds such as buckwheat and golden soybeans to farmers in July. This batch of seeds can increase the replanting area by more than 38,000 hectares. By mid-August, 110,000 yuan in relief funds had been distributed to help severely affected households solve their production and living difficulties. Party and government leading organs in various counties are also actively seeking sideline income sources for disaster victims to increase their income. The CCP Jiaohe County Committee specifically convened a sideline production conference attended by township general branch secretaries, agricultural cooperative directors, and supply and marketing cooperative directors. After exploring sideline production sources, the county can carry out more than 130 types of sideline production, with planned income of more than 4 million yuan. Currently, more than 200 agricultural cooperatives across the county have generally launched a surge in sideline production, with income already exceeding 1.3 million yuan by mid-August. The CCP Huaide County Committee also contacted local sugar factories, railways, stone quarries, and other relevant departments, and can organize 4,700 disaster victims to participate in various types of labor, increasing sideline income. The development of these sideline productions can not only greatly compensate for agricultural losses but also encourage disaster victims to increase production and increase their income.

    “能救一亩是一亩，能收一棵是一棵”
    吉林农民抢救受灾的农作物
    本报长春24日电　目前，吉林省洪水已经下降，各级党政领导机关正采取各种措施领导灾民生产自救。全省农民在“能救一亩是一亩，能收一棵是一棵”的口号下，抢救遭到不同程度灾害的七十一万多公顷土地上的农作物。到8月20日已排除二十二万多公顷地的积水，并加强了田间管理。永吉县口前区前峰、前明等四个农业社受灾以后，组织二千多人经过两天的时间，就用手扶植起一百二十多公顷倒伏的庄稼。这些庄稼现在长得都很好。农安县靠山区还将一千五百多公顷的高粱、苞米放了秋垅，以促进农作物的早熟。
    吉林省人民委员会为支援灾区农民生产，在七月份就调拨了荞麦、金黄豆等三千五百多吨晚田种籽给农民，这批种籽可增加复种面积三万八千多公顷。到八月中旬已发放十一万元救济款，帮助严重的受灾户解决生产和生活上的困难。各县党政领导机关并积极为灾民寻找副业来源，以增加收入。中共蛟河县委专门召集了乡总支书记、农业社主任和供销社主任等参加的副业生产会议。经过挖掘副业生产来源，全县可进行一百三十多种副业生产，计划收入四百多万元。现在全县已有二百多个农业社普遍掀起了副业生产热潮，到八月中旬已经收入了一百三十多万元。中共怀德县委，还与当地糖厂、铁路、打石厂等有关部门联系，可以组织四千七百多灾民参加各种不同的劳动，增加副业收入。这些副业生产开展后，不仅可以大量弥补农业上的损失，而且鼓励了灾民增加生产和增加收入的信心。
