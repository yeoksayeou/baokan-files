Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 31st - Pakistani political figures have generally expressed support for Egypt's actions in exercising its sovereignty.

Karachi Mayor Siddiq Wahab stated on July 29th that the Egyptian President's decision was bold and correct.

Mir Abdul Qayyum, General Secretary of the Pakistan Republican Party, said in Lahore on the same day: President Abdul Nasser's action of nationalizing the Suez Canal has brought "a ray of light on the edge of a cloud that has long enveloped the Middle East." He praised it as a "great action by a patriotic statesman" and expressed his conviction that the people and government of Pakistan will "do everything possible to support the Egyptian people in their historic struggle for freedom."

Mir, Secretary of the Pakistan World Muslim Association, issued a statement calling on the Pakistani government to support the Egyptian people in their struggle against foreign interference and imperialist conspiracies.

Muhammad Ashraf Bhatti, convener of the Lahore Islamic Democratic Conference, said that this "historic step" will end the Western imperialists' exploitation of the East. He called on all Eastern countries to support Egypt and stand by its side.

    巴基斯坦世界穆斯林协会秘书米尔发表声明，要求巴基斯坦政府支持埃及人民进行反对外国干涉和帝国主义阴谋的斗争。
    拉合尔伊斯兰民主大会召集人穆罕默德·阿希拉夫·巴蒂说，这个“具有历史意义的步骤”将使西方帝国主义者剥削东方的情况终结。他要求一切东方国家支持埃及，同它站在一边。
