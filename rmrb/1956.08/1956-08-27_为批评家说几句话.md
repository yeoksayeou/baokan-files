    A Few Words for Critics
    Li Xifan
    For a long time, two slogans have been popular in literary and art circles: "Creation lags behind reality, and criticism lags behind creation." In literary and art circles, one can often see this phenomenon: whenever criticism is mentioned in conversation, people frown deeply, and some well-meaning comrades even shake their heads slowly, as if everything is unimaginable. Some authors say with indignation: Look, the backwardness in creation is all caused by you critics, you who use concepts and formulas to shackle our thinking. After the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, literary and art criticism naturally became the target of public criticism. Some literary and art discussion meetings even wrote in the notification of the discussion meeting: What kind of pressure have you been subjected to in your creation in the past (such as literary and art criticism)? It seems that all the backward phenomena in literary and art creation should be the responsibility of literary and art criticism. Under this circumstance, some critics who lack self-confidence have been frightened by this accusation. Some simply declared that they had "changed careers" and would no longer engage in criticism but go to write novels, and some simply put down their pens and politely declined all invitations to write. The young critics who are just learning to walk are even more afraid to approach it, and after retreating, they can't help but envy creation; a young critic said with emotion: "Criticism cannot stand the test of history, only great works can stand the test of history. Erroneous criticism talks about Sholokhov's works with relish; correct criticism still uses Sholokhov's works as an example to refute the absurdity of erroneous criticism." It seems that the so-called literary and art criticism is just one right and wrong, and the other is also a right and wrong. Only creation can be immortal, always "right," and without "wrong." Since it is a hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending, why do this "thankless" criticism? It is better to choose another flower and go to another house. As a result, the old critics are silent, and the new critics are also depressed.
    Is all the backwardness in literature and art the fault of the critics?
    Admittedly, there has been rude criticism in literary and art circles in recent years, as well as various kinds of vulgar and simplistic criticism, which should be criticized. However, we should also believe that many serious critics must also have a bitter heart if they have to point out more than praise in their comments. The joy of critics lies in obtaining good works to read and recommend, and definitely not in scolding everything.
    Critics need to have a high degree of aesthetic cultivation, so that they can write creative criticism. They should not say some clichés that everyone else is saying, nor should they imitate one after another. Creative criticism should explain and enrich the writer's creation, and help readers understand the work more deeply through living language. And truly great critics also need to be good at seeing things that the writer may not fully understand through the world of artistic images created by the writer. However, no matter how high the aesthetic level of literary and art criticism is, it is impossible to open up magnificent flowers on the anemic soil of literary and artistic creation. Literary and art criticism is by no means an isolated phenomenon in the tide of literary and art thought. Creation and criticism are a whole in literary and art phenomena. Criticism can guide or hinder the prosperity and development of creation, and creation can also promote or influence the prosperity and development of criticism. They are mutually causal and inseparable. Therefore, the backward phenomenon in criticism not only reflects the problem in criticism, but also illustrates the level of our literary and artistic creation. High-rise buildings must be built on a solid foundation, and only duckweed floats on the water. It is like medieval alchemists trying to extract gold from rubble to expect miracles in criticism without miracles in creation. We need to overcome all the backward phenomena in literary and art criticism, and we need to improve the aesthetic quality of literary and art criticism, but this is a wish that can only be achieved through the joint efforts of the literary and art circles; and truly responsible literary and art workers will definitely seriously face the backward phenomena in literature and art, and find out the real reasons from all aspects, and find out the reasons from the writers' life practice and creative practice, and cannot simply "scold everything" critics.

    为批评家说几句话
    李希凡
    很久以来，文艺界就流行着两句口号，叫做“创作落后于现实，批评落后于创作”。在文艺界经常可以看到这样一种现象：闲谈中只要一提到批评，就会有人深深地锁起了眉头，有的好心的同志甚至慢悠悠地摇摇头。意思大概是一切不堪设想。有些作者不无愤慨地说：瞧，创作上的落后，都是你们批评家搞的，是你们用概念和公式套住了我们的思想。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针提出之后，成为众矢之的的自然又是文艺批评。有些文艺问题的讨论会，甚至在开讨论会的通知上写着：你在创作中过去受到过什么样的压力（例如文艺批评）等等，仿佛文艺创作中的一切落后现象，都要由文艺批评负责。在这种情况下，一些缺乏自信心的批评家，就被这种责难吓昏了。有的干脆声明自己已经“转业”，不再搞批评而要去写小说了，有的干脆搁笔，委婉地谢绝一切约稿。而刚刚学步的年轻的批评工作者，就更加退避三舍，退避之余，不免也开始艳羡创作了；有一位年轻的批评工作者感慨地说：“批评是经不起历史考验的，只有伟大的作品才经得起历史的考验。错误的批评津津有味地谈论萧洛霍夫的作品；正确的批评，却也仍然以萧洛霍夫的作品为例驳斥错误批评的荒谬。”看来，似乎所谓文艺批评也者，此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，只有创作才可能是不朽的，永远是“是”，而没有“非”。既然是百花齐放、百家争鸣，那何必搞这“费力不讨好”的批评呢？还是另选别花另走他家的好。于是，老的批评家沉默了，新的批评家也消沉了。
    难道文艺上的一切落后现象，都是批评家的罪过吗？
    诚然，文艺界近年来有过粗暴的批评，也有过各式各样的庸俗的、简单化的批评，这应该受到批判。但是，我们也应该相信，许多认真的批评家假使他在他的评论中不得不指斥多于赞许的话，他的心也一定是苦的。批评家的愉快正是在得佳作而读之，而推荐之，决不是在骂倒一切。
    批评家需要有高度的美学修养，这样，他才能写出创造性的批评。他不应该说些人云亦云的陈词滥调，也不应该千篇一腔地因循模仿。创造性的批评，要解释和丰富作家的创作，通过活的语言帮助读者对于作品理解得更深。而真正伟大的批评家，还需要善于透过作家所创造的艺术形象的世界，看到作家未必全然理解的东西。但是，文艺批评无论有多么高度的美学水平，也不可能在贫血的文学和艺术创作的土壤上开放出瑰丽的花朵。文艺批评决不是文艺思潮中孤立存在的现象。创作和批评，是文艺现象上的整体，批评可以引导或阻碍创作的繁荣和发展，创作同样也可以推动或影响批评的繁荣和发展，它们是互为因果不可分离的。因此，批评上的落后现象，并不只是反映了批评上的问题，也说明了我们文学艺术创作上的水平。高楼大厦必须建筑在巩固的基地上，只有浮萍才飘浮在水面上。没有创作上的奇迹，却希图有批评上的奇迹，这正像中世纪炼金的术士妄想从瓦砾里炼出黄金一样。我们需要克服文艺批评上的一切落后现象，我们需要提高文艺批评的美学质量，但是，这却是文艺界共同努力才能达到的愿望；而真正负责的文艺工作者，一定会十分严肃地正视文艺上的落后现象，从各个方面找出真正的原因来，从作家们的生活实践和创作实践中找出原因来，不能单单“骂倒一切”批评家。
