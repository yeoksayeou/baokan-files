Column: Reaction to Criticism

    A letter from the Labor and Wage Section of the Tangshan Joint Public-Private Qixin Cement Company states: The article "Trainees or Handymen?" published in the People's Daily on July 7th criticized us for frequently assigning trainees from the cultural training class to do odd jobs. After our review, this criticism is correct. Now, according to work needs, we have assigned some technicians and young and strong workers studying in the cultural training class to production posts, and the rest remain in the training class to continue their studies.

    学员工人已经划清
    唐山公私合营启新水泥公司劳动工资科来信说：七月七日人民日报发表的“是学员还是杂工”一文，批评我们不该经常抽调文化培训班的学员去作杂工，经我们检查，这个批评是正确的。现在，我们已经根据工作需要，把部分在文化培训班学习的技工和青壮工，分配到生产岗位上去，其余的仍留在培训班，组织他们继续学习。
