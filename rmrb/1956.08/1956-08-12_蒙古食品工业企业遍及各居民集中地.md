Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, August 11th: According to the Mongolian "News" report, Mongolia, which had no food industry before the revolution, now has a food industrial enterprise for every four hundred people on average. The more than two thousand food industrial enterprises that have been built successively are spread throughout all populated areas of the country.

The vast majority of Mongolia's food industrial enterprises were established after the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party passed a resolution on developing the food industry in 1940. In state-owned industry, the proportion accounted for by the food industry had reached approximately 52% in 1955.

Oil production has grown rapidly. Before 1948, Mongolia needed to import a large amount of butter every year, but now it exports thousands of tons of high-quality domestic oil.

    蒙古食品工业企业遍及各居民集中地
    据新华社11日讯　乌兰巴托消息：据蒙古“消息报”报道，在革命以前没有食品工业的蒙古，现在平均每四百多人就有一个食品工业企业，陆续建设起来的两千多个食品工业企业遍及全国各居民集中地。
    蒙古的食品工业企业绝大多数都是在1940年蒙古人民革命党通过了有关发展食品工业的决议以后建立起来的。在国营工业中，食品工业所占的比重1955年已经达到约52％。
    油类生产增长得很快，在1948年以前，蒙古每年需要输入大量黄油，而现在却有数以千吨计的国产优质油脂输出。
