A Popular Grain Store

The comrades working at the Ximishi Grain Store in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, have a good service attitude and are welcomed by the nearby masses.

The comrades at this grain store can always think of the masses. For example, if many people are waiting outside to buy grain before the store opens, they open early to sell grain. Even after closing time, they leave someone on duty until 8:00 PM. This reduces the phenomenon of queuing to buy grain. Once, an elderly woman from Miaoqian Street came to the store to buy grain. Director Zhao of the store thought, how can she carry all this grain back? So he decided to carry the grain home for her. People were so moved they didn't know what to say!

This grain store also often publicizes and explains grain supply policies to the masses. For example, when the fixed-time supply method was cancelled, they not only publicized it on the blackboard, but also held meetings with the residents' committee. Because their publicity work was well done and it was convenient for the masses to buy grain, the actual monthly grain sales decreased compared to before. They also hung an opinion book at the entrance and regularly held meetings with residents' representatives to solicit opinions.

They also pay close attention to grain storage, always implementing diligent cleaning and inspection, as well as adopting the advanced-in, advanced-out and later-in, later-out grain selling methods. They generally achieve four cleans (clean warehouse, clean counter, clean floor, clean bags). In recent years, there has never been a single grain spoilage incident. (Bai Zhe)

An Unpopular Grain Supply Station

The Jin Tie District Grain Supply Station in Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, has stipulated a "card system" for selling grain. This means that each resident group is issued a grain purchase card, and residents take turns going to the supply station to buy grain, but the card can only be used once a day and is limited to one household. Most of the residents in the Jin Tie District are working people with unstable incomes, and they cannot buy all of their monthly food at once, so residents compete to grab the cards in order to buy grain, sometimes even arguing. Because of buying grain with cards, the staff at the supply station are not as busy as before and happily say: "This is the superiority of the system."

Is this system really superior? The residents of the Jin Tie District need to answer. (Leng Qing)

Delivery to the Field

The members of the Liangzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, recently received more than 30,000 yuan in advance grain payments. The members all wanted to take this opportunity to buy some supplies needed for the summer, but they are in the busy stage of summer hoeing, and no one wants to abandon production to go to the market. At this time, the Changtu County Department Store, in conjunction with the Liangzhongqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative, immediately sent people carrying vests, undershirts, rubber shoes, towels, socks, shirts, soap, and more than 180 other kinds of general merchandise to the fields where the members of the Liangzhong Agricultural Cooperative were working, so that the members of the Agricultural Cooperative could freely choose and buy the goods they needed without affecting production.

After selling in the fields, the people from the department store and the supply and marketing cooperative also brought samples of autumn goods, displayed them to the farmers during their work breaks, solicited their opinions, and carried out pre-sale registration work.

The members of the Liangzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative are very satisfied with this approach of the department store and the supply and marketing cooperative. (Wang Zhihan)

Everyone Says: Who is Good and Who is Bad?

The spring of my small alarm clock broke, and I took it to the Xidan Public-Private Joint Hengdeli Watch Store in Beijing to have it replaced. An old shop assistant looked at it and patiently said to me: "Comrade, your small clock must be fitted with a Hungarian original spring, but we don't have this kind of spring. If we casually fit it with a Western or Chinese spring, it definitely won't be accurate. This would not only delay your affairs but would also make us look dishonest and lose the trust of customers. You should wait for the original spring to arrive."

I originally intended not to repair it, but I rely on this small alarm clock every day to urge me to work and rest on time. I thought I would try my luck at the No. 1 Service Station of the No. 4 Clock Repair Production Cooperative on West Chang'an Street. Unexpectedly, they accepted the job. I was really happy!

I asked cautiously: "What kind of spring will you use?"

They said: "A Western spring."

"Will it be accurate?" I asked anxiously again.

"Guaranteed to be accurate," they replied with confidence.

Because I was eager to use the clock, I agreed to replace it with a Western spring at a high price of 3.60 yuan (the small clock itself only cost 12.60 yuan).

Needless to say, I was fooled. I regret not listening to the old shop assistant at the Hengdeli Watch Store. The small clock stopped ticking the very night I brought it back after it was repaired. I shook it a few times and it started ticking again, but it stopped again in a few hours. I had to take time out to have it repaired again, but it still stopped and started intermittently.

Please compare the above two service attitudes and business styles: who is good and who is bad? (Zhang Zheng)

There is such a Hygienic Catering Business!

On the evening of June 24th, I was passing through Jinan on the highway and went to the "Feng Ju Heng Restaurant" at Jingyi Road and Xiaowei Road to eat. The walls of the restaurant were painted snow-white, and there was a license issued by the Jinan Patriotic Health Campaign Committee for a "Clean and Hygienic Catering Business" hanging on the wall. At first glance, it would indeed make a good impression. However, the millet porridge they sold was sour, and the kidney noodles had an unpleasant stench. I reluctantly ate it because I was hungry at the time. That night, I got sick, first with stomach pain, followed by vomiting.

Feng Ju Heng Restaurant is a "Clean and Hygienic Household" in Jinan City, but it is not hygienic at all. Now that the weather is hot, whether the catering industry in various places is clean and hygienic has a great relationship with people's health. I hope that the catering industry in various places will not be as unhygienic as this "Clean and Hygienic" catering business. (Cao Peilin)

    什么样的服务态度和服务方法好
    什么样的服务态度和服务方法不好
    受欢迎的粮食门市部
    山西太原市西米市粮食门市部工作同志的服务态度好，受到了附近群众的欢迎。
    这个粮食门市部的工作同志都能处处为群众着想。例如，还没有开门营业的时候，如果外面等了许多购粮群众，他们就提早开门卖粮；就是下班时间，也留人值日到八点钟为止。这样，排队购粮的现象减少了。一次，庙前街一位年迈的老太太到门市部买粮食，门市部的赵主任就想，这些粮食她怎么背得回去？于是决定把粮食代老太太扛回家去。感动得人们不知说啥好！
    这个门市部还能经常向群众宣传解释粮食供应政策。例如取消定时供应办法的时候，他们除在黑板上宣传外，还召开居民委员会。因为他们的宣传工作做得好，群众买粮方便，每月实销的粮食就比以前减少了。他们还在门口挂了意见簿，定时召开居民代表会来征求意见。
    他们对粮食保管也很注意，始终贯彻了勤打扫勤检查，以及采取先进先销，后进后销的售粮办法。他们一般作到了四净（仓库净，柜台净，地面净，袋子净），几年来没有发生过一次坏粮事故。（白哲）
    不受欢迎的粮食供应站
    辽宁锦州市锦铁区粮食供应站规定了“卡片制”的售粮方法。这就是在每个居民组发一个购粮卡片，居民轮流到供应站去购买，但卡片每天只准用一次，而且只限一户购买。锦铁区的居民大部分是收入不固定的劳动人民，他们不能把一个月的食粮都买到家里，因而居民们为了买粮都争先恐后的抢卡片，有时甚至吵起架来。由于凭卡片买粮，供应站的工作人员不像以前那样忙乱，都高兴地说：“这是制度的优越。”
    这种制度到底优越不优越呢？需要锦铁区的居民来回答。

    送货到地头
    辽宁省昌图县亮中农业生产合作社的社员在最近领到了三万多元的预购粮款。社员们都想趁此买些夏季需要的用品，可是正处于夏锄紧张阶段，谁也不愿放弃生产去赶集。这时，昌图县百货公司会同亮中桥供销合作社马上派人携带着背心、汗衫、胶鞋、毛巾、袜子、衬衣、香皂等一百八十多种百货送到亮中农业社社员正在进行生产的地头上，使农业社社员们在不影响生产的情况下任意挑选和购买他们所需要的商品。
    在地头推销后，百货公司和供销社的人又带去秋季商品样品，趁农民工余时间展览出来给他们看，征求他们的意见，并且进行预售登记工作。
    亮中农业生产合作社的社员们对百货公司和供销合作社的这种做法感到非常满意。　（王智翰）
    大家说：谁好谁坏？
    我的小闹钟的弦断了，送到北京市西单公私合营亨得利钟表行去配弦。一位老店员看了看，对我耐心地说：“同志，你这座小钟非配匈牙利原弦不可，这种弦我们还没有。如果马马虎虎的给你配上个西洋弦或中国弦，那保险走不准。这样，一来耽误你的事；二来也显得我们不诚实，失去顾客的信任，你还是等配原弦吧。”
    我本打算不修了，可是这个小闹钟是我每天离不开的，它督促我按时作息。我想再到西长安街第四钟表修理生产合作社第一服务站去碰碰运气吧，出乎意料之外，他们接下了这个活。我真高兴啊！
    我警惕地问了一句：“配什么弦？”
    他们说：“西洋弦。”
    “能走的准吗？”我耽心地又问了一句。
    “保险走的准，”回答的挺有把握。
    由于用钟表的心切，我就以三元六角的高价同意换西洋弦了（买这座小钟才十二元六角）。
    不用说，我是上当了。我悔不该不听亨得利钟表行那位老店员的话。这座小钟修好后取回来的当天晚上就停了摆，我摇晃了几下又走起来；可是等不到几小时又不走了。不得已，我又抽空去回修了一次，结果还是时停时走。
    上面两种服务态度和商业作风，请大家来评比一下：谁好谁坏？
             （张铮）
    有这样一家卫生饮食业户！
    六月二十四日傍晚，我因公路过济南，到经一路小纬一路的“丰聚恒饭店”吃饭。这家饭店屋里四壁粉刷得雪白，墙上还张挂着一张由济南市爱国卫生运动委员会发给的“清洁卫生饮食业户”的执照，乍一看，确实会使人发生好感。可是他们卖的小米稀饭却是发酸的，腰花面也有一股难闻的臭味，当时我因肚饿勉强吃了下去，当天夜里我就病了，先是肚痛，接着呕吐。
    丰聚恒饭店是济南市的“清洁卫生饮食户”，可是一点也不卫生。现在天气热了，各地饮食业是否清洁卫生对人们的身体健康有着很大的关系，希望各地的饮食业不要像这家“清洁卫生”饮食业这样不卫生。　（曹沛霖）
