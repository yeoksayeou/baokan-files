Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 8th: The Indian News Agency reports that Indian Prime Minister Nehru made a statement on the Suez Canal issue in the People's House on August 8th (this statement was also read in the Federal House) as follows:
	On July 26th, President Nasser announced in a speech in Alexandria that the Suez Canal Company had been nationalized. Following the issuance of the nationalization law by the President's order, the control of the company's offices in Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, and Cairo has been taken over by the Egyptian government.
	The assets and debts of the company have been taken over by the state. The law stipulates that shareholders will be compensated according to the stock market price on the day before nationalization. This compensation will be paid after the transfer of all assets and property of the company.
	The management of the Suez Canal navigation is entrusted to an independent agency, which has an independent budget and possesses all powers, unrestricted by government rules and regulations.
	The funds and assets of the nationalized company have been frozen. The new agency is obliged to retain existing personnel, and these personnel are not allowed to leave their posts without permission. The decree also stipulates the implementation of this law and penalties for violators.
	This announcement has aroused worldwide repercussions. A serious crisis has arisen, which, if not resolved through peaceful means, could lead to conflict, the scope and impact of which are difficult to estimate. In this crisis, the first thing to consider is striving for a calmer atmosphere and a rational perspective. When emotions dominate, the real issues recede into the background, or are viewed or presented in such a way as to emphasize contentious differences and arouse or incite already heightened emotions.
	It is not easy for anyone to escape this unfortunate entanglement, even more difficult for the parties in dispute, and absolute objectivity is impossible even for others. In this crisis, we are not only dealing with the issues in dispute, but we also see the rise and conflict of powerful forces.
	Therefore, we must deal with the problem facing us, otherwise, it will overwhelm us. So, it is appropriate to look at the facts and history of this issue.

		Egypt's Sovereignty Over the Canal is Undisputed
	The Suez Canal Company, which has been nationalized by Egypt, controls the operations and facilities and possesses the lease of the Suez Canal. The canal itself is in Egypt and is an integral part of Egypt. Therefore, Egypt's sovereignty is beyond doubt. This was recognized in the license granted to the canal company in 1856 by the Governor of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, in subsequent agreements, and as recently as 1954. The original 1856 license, which stipulated the terms of the canal lease, stated that the Suez Canal "should always remain open as a neutral waterway to all merchant ships sailing from one sea to another, without any distinction, exclusion, or preference to any person or nation..."
	The 1888 Constantinople Convention reaffirmed that the Suez Canal should always remain free and open.
	The Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954, reached between the governments of the United Kingdom and Egypt, clearly expressed the attitude towards Egypt's sovereignty on the one hand and the nature of this international waterway.
	The People's House will be interested in the narrative in this agreement, which is an agreement concluded shortly before the current crisis between Egypt and the United Kingdom, the two main parties. Article 8 of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement states: "The two contracting governments recognize that the Suez Maritime Canal is an integral part of Egypt, a waterway of international importance in economic, commercial and strategic terms, and express their determination to uphold the agreement signed in Constantinople on October 29, 1888, guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal."
	In a solemn agreement between Egypt and the United Kingdom, Egypt's sovereignty and the nature of this waterway of "international importance" were recognized, and both countries expressed their determination to uphold the 1888 Convention.
	The Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian company, and Egypt believes that this company should abide by the laws of the country. Except for a small portion, the company's shares are owned by foreign governments or nationals. The British government owns 44% of the shares. The board of directors has thirty-two directors: nine British, sixteen French, five Egyptian, one American, and one Dutch.
	The Suez Canal Company's lease was originally due to expire in 1968; the current Egyptian government and previous Egyptian governments have publicly announced that the lease will not be extended. At that time, various assets and obligations will be transferred to Egypt in accordance with the 1856 agreement.
	Therefore, the Egyptian government's current decision appears to be to take over the Suez Canal Company ahead of schedule. There is no question of confiscation here, as the canal company's shareholders will be compensated according to market prices. Even if there are any outstanding differences on this matter, these differences do not need to give rise to developments that lead to an international crisis.
	The Egyptian government has also reiterated that they will respect all obligations they have undertaken under international agreements, and they have also referred to the 1888 Convention and the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement in their reiteration.

	Western threats of displaying the use of force do not take into account the situation in today's world and Asia.
	The reactions of the French and United Kingdom governments to Egypt's announcement were swift, sharp, and intense. Honorable members of the People's House have seen in the newspapers news of land and naval actions ordered by the United Kingdom and France, as well as certain military measures taken by Egypt. These actions have been heavily publicized, and they have made the situation even more serious. All of this has not only affected Egyptian public opinion but also the public opinion of the entire Arab world. Throughout Asia, which has not forgotten its past colonial rule, it has aroused great indignation.
	I do not want to add fuel to the fire of already aroused anger, but if I do not state that threatening to use the display of force to resolve this dispute or to forcibly impose their views on this issue is the wrong approach, then I have not fulfilled my obligations to the People's House and our country, nor have I fulfilled my obligations to all parties related to this crisis, especially to Britain and France. This method is not the method of this era, this method is not based on reason. It does not take into account the situation in today's world and the situation in today's Asia. If that were all, we might be able to restrain ourselves patiently and assume that this mood will pass. However, it would be unrealistic and imprudent if we did not express our deep concern about these developments and point out their ominous implications. We deeply regret these reactions and the measures reportedly taken as a result, and we express our hope that these reactions and measures will cease, that the parties concerned will be able to negotiate, and that a peaceful solution will be sought.
	We also deeply regret that in the various steps that led to this crisis, neither party took the initiative to notify or consult each other, either alone or jointly.
	We have great respect and concern for Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, and we also have great respect and concern for our friendly relations with it. Egypt's decision to nationalize was prompted by the US government's decision on the Aswan Dam issue, and the United Kingdom government later took the same decision. The manner in which this decision was made hurt Egypt's pride and self-esteem even more than the decision itself, and it took even less account of a nation's emotions.
	The suddenness of the nationalization decision and the way it was implemented may also be part of the reason for these intense reactions. However, the various provisions for nationalization under Egyptian law are within the scope of the Egyptian government's authority.
	As I told the People's House a few days ago, President Nasser and I did not discuss the Suez Canal issue during our recent meeting. Considering this issue and making the relevant decisions must have been a later matter.
	The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have held lengthy emergency consultations, and their views have been explained in a joint communiqué, which honorable members have probably seen in newspaper reports.

	India does not consider the list of invited countries to be appropriate.
	This communiqué recognizes Egypt's autonomous rights, but it seems to limit this autonomous right only to the nationalization of assets that—in the words of the communiqué—"do not have the characteristics of international interests." If this is the point of contention, then those intense reactions and belligerent postures—though I still hope these postures are not preparations for war—are unnecessary, and their consequences are distressing.
	The three countries have also agreed to convene a meeting in London on August 16, 1956, of the signatory countries of the 1888 Convention and other countries mainly related to the use of the canal, and they have also agreed to participate in this meeting. The United Kingdom has, according to the decision, sent invitations to twenty-three countries, namely: Australia, Ceylon, Denmark, Egypt, Ethiopia, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United States, Soviet Union.
	The Indian government received an invitation from the United Kingdom on August 3 to attend the London conference "on the Suez Canal issue." Prior to this, the United Kingdom government had been constantly informing the Indian government of developments.
	The government recognizes that the situation and the circumstances that have arisen are extremely serious, and it has given urgent and careful consideration to all aspects of this issue—including the reply to the invitation. The government has also been in contact with relevant countries, including Egypt.
	The government has always been clear that it cannot participate in any meeting that imposes the conclusions to be reached on the participants in advance. The government will also refuse to participate in any preparations for war or sanctions. Or participate in any steps that infringe on Egypt's sovereignty. The government is also concerned that many countries that should be included in the category of signatories or major users of the 1888 Convention have not been included in the list of invitees. I do not want to make any invidious distinctions, but I would like to explain to the People's House that the exclusion of Burma seems to us to be a particularly regrettable omission. Yugoslavia, as a successor state in terms of the 1888 Convention and also a maritime country, should also be included among the invited countries. Therefore, the Indian government does not consider the list of invited countries to be appropriate.

	India's participation in the meeting is in no way subject to prior restrictions or constraints.
	The government has requested clarification from the United Kingdom government, and certainly believes that its participation in the meeting does not mean that it is limited or constrained by the practices and principles stated in the joint communiqué. It recognizes that Egypt cannot and will not participate in the Suez Canal meeting, because it is only an invitee in this meeting, and it has not been consulted on the issue of convening this meeting.
	The Indian government must make a decision on the situation it faces. India is not an irrelevant party. It is a major user of this waterway, and this dispute is not without impact on its economic life and development, not to mention the development of the world situation related to this.
	Moreover, India is very concerned about avoiding conflict. It has friendly relations with Egypt, and together they have accepted the Bandung Declaration and the "Five Principles." India also has good and close relations with the major Western countries concerned. We attach great importance to these relationships, as this House and the whole world know. The considerations and criteria on which the government had to base its decision—this was not an easy decision to make—were how it could most effectively contribute to avoiding conflict and finding a peaceful solution before it was too late. The People's House will recognize the seriousness of the situation, as the government does.

  India's greatest concern is to negotiate a solution on the basis of Egyptian sovereignty.
	Therefore, India's greatest concern is to resolve this issue through an agreement between all parties concerned on the basis of Egyptian sovereignty and dignity, and to abandon the postures of threat and violence, and unilateral actions on either side.
	Therefore, the government has obtained the necessary assurances from the United Kingdom and has made its position very clear. The government is convinced that its participation in the London Conference will not harm the interests of Egypt or its sovereignty and dignity. The government, feeling the gravity of its responsibility, has decided to accept the invitation and send a representative to the conference.
	The government has maintained close contact with Indonesia and Ceylon, and with other countries that broadly take the same position as India on this issue.
	The government is fully aware that this meeting cannot reach a final decision, as that requires Egypt's consent.
	Sir, I understand that the People's House is as seriously concerned about this issue as the government. I would like to ask the People's House to share the government's hope that India's participation will help in the effort to strive for a peaceful solution.

    尼赫鲁就苏彝士运河问题发表的声明全文
    新华社讯　据印度新闻处新德里八日电：印度总理尼赫鲁于八月八日就苏彝士运河问题在人民院发表声明（这篇声明同时在联邦院宣读）如下：　　七月二十六日，纳赛尔总统在亚历山大港发表的演说中宣布，苏彝士运河公司已经收归国有。在总统的命令颁布了国有化法律以后，该公司在塞得港、伊士美利亚、苏彝士和开罗的办事处的控制权已经为埃及政府所接管。　　公司的资产和债务由国家接管。法律规定按照在收归国有前一天的股票市场价格赔偿股东。这种赔偿将在公司的全部资产和财产移交后偿付。　　苏彝士运河航务管理工作委托给一个独立的机构，它有独立的预算，并且拥有一切权力，不受政府的规则和条例的限制。
    收归国有的公司的款项和资产已经被冻结。新的机构有义务保留现有人员，同时，这些人员不经许可不准离职。法令还规定执行这个法律和对违法者处罚。　　这项宣布引起了世界范围的反响。一个严重的危机发生了，这种危机如果不是通过和平的方法予以解决，便会导致冲突，而这种冲突的范围和影响是不易估计的。在这个危机中，首先必须考虑争取一个较平静的气氛和具有理性的看法。当情感占优势的时候，真正的问题便退居次要地位，或者是这样看待它或提出它，以致强调争执方面的分歧和引起或煽动已经激起的情感。　　任何人要逃避这种不幸的牵连是不容易的，对争执方面来说更加不容易，甚至对其他人来说，绝对客观也是不可能的。在这种危机中，我们不仅要应付争执中的问题，而且我们看到了强大力量的兴起和冲突。
    因此，我们必须处理面对我们的问题，否则，它便会把我们压倒。所以，看一看这个问题的事实和历史是适当的。
       埃及对运河的主权是毫无疑问的
    被埃及收归国有的苏彝士运河公司控制了经营和设备，并且拥有苏彝士运河的租借权。这条运河本身在埃及，并且是埃及的不可分割的一部分。因此，埃及的主权是毫无疑问的。在鄂图曼帝国下的埃及总督在1856年给予运河公司的执照中和在后来的协定中以及在近到1954年的时候，都承认了这一点。规定运河租借权条款的原来的1856年执照规定，苏彝士运河“应该作为一条中立的水道对从一个海洋驶往另一个海洋的一切商船始终保持开放，不得对人或国家有任何区别、排斥或偏爱……”
    1888年的君士坦丁堡公约重申，苏彝士运河应该始终保持自由和开放。
    在联合王国和埃及两国政府达成的1954年的英埃协定中清楚地表示了对埃及一方面的主权和这条国际水道的性质所抱的态度。
    人民院会对这个协定中的叙述感到兴趣，这个协定是在目前的危机中的两个主要方面埃及和联合王国前不久才缔结的协定。英埃协定的第八条说：“两缔约国政府认识到苏彝士海运运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分，是一条在经济上、商业上和战略上具有国际重要性的水道，并表示决心维护1888年10月29日在君士坦丁堡签订的保证在苏彝士运河有通航自由的协定。”
    在埃及和联合王国缔结的一项庄严的协定中承认了埃及一方面的主权和这条具有“国际重要性”的水道的性质，它们两国还都表示决心维护1888年公约。
    苏彝士运河公司是一个埃及公司，埃及认为，这个公司应该遵守这个国家的法律。这个公司的股票除了一小部分以外是为外国政府或国民所拥有。英国政府拥有44％的股票。董事会中有三十二个董事：九个英国人、十六个法国人、五个埃及人、一个美国人和一个荷兰人。
    苏彝士运河公司的租借期本来到1968年将要满期；现任的埃及政府和前任各届埃及政府都曾经公开宣布租借期不会再加以延长。到那时，各种资产和义务都将根据1856年的协定转交给埃及。
    因此，埃及政府现在的决定看来是要提前接收苏彝士运河公司。这里并不产生没收的问题，因为运河公司的股票所有者们将根据市场价格得到补偿。即使这件事情上还存在着任何悬而未决的分歧的话，这些分歧也并不需要引起导致国际危机的那样一些事态发展。　　埃及政府也已经重申他们将尊重他们根据国际协定所承担一切义务，并且他们在重申的时候也提到了1888年的公约和1954年的英埃协定。
    西方威胁用炫耀使用武力的方法是没有考虑到今日世界和亚洲的情况
    法国政府和联合王国政府对埃及这项宣告的反应很快，很尖锐，也很激烈。人民院可敬的议员们已经看到报纸上关于联合王国和法国下令采取的陆海军行动以及埃及所采取的某些军事措施的消息。对于这些行动渲染得很厉害，它们已经使局势变得更加严重。这一切不仅影响了埃及的舆论，而且也影响了整个阿拉伯世界的舆论。在还没有忘却过去所受的殖民地统治的整个亚洲，激起了巨大的愤懑。
    我不想给已经激起的忿怒火上添薪，但是如果我不说明威胁用炫耀使用武力的办法来解决这一纠纷或强迫推行他们在这一问题上的观点是错误的办法的话，那我就没有履行我对人民院和我们国家所应尽的义务，甚至也没有履行我对同这一危机有关联的一切方面所应尽的义务，尤其是没有履行我对英国和法国所应尽的义务。这种方法不是这个时代的方法，这种方法也不是出于理智。它没有考虑到今日世界的情况和今日亚洲的情况。如果一切就是这样，我们也许可以耐心地克制自己，并且设想这种情绪将会过去。但是，如果我们不表示自己对这些事态的深切关怀，不指出它们的不祥的含意，那将是不实事求是的，也是不谨慎的。我们对于这些反应和据传因此而采取的措施觉得非常遗憾，我们表示，我们希望这些反应和措施能够停止，有关方面将能进行谈判，并且寻求和平的解决办法。
    我们也感到非常遗憾的是，在引起这种危机的各种步骤中，任何一方都没有独自或共同地主动互相通知或互相磋商。
    我们对于埃及的主权和尊严非常尊重和关心，对于我们同它的友好关系也非常尊重和关心。埃及实行国有化的决定是由美国政府在阿斯旺水坝问题上的决定所促成的，联合王国政府后来也采取了同样的决定。而作出这项决定的方式比这项决定本身更加伤害了埃及的自豪感和自尊心，更加不考虑一个民族的绪情。
    作出国有化决定的突然性和执行这一决定的方式，可能也是促成这些激烈的反应的一部分因素。但是，根据埃及法律实行国有化的各项规定本身则是属于埃及政府职权范围以内的。
    正如我在几天以前已经告诉人民院的那样，在纳赛尔总统和我最近相会的时候，我们并没有讨论苏彝士运河问题。考虑这个问题和作出有关的决定一定是后来的事情。
    美国、联合王国和法国三国政府进行了长时间的紧急磋商，它们的观点已经在一篇联合公报中说明了，各位可敬的议员想必已经在报纸消息中看到这项公报。
     印度不认为被邀请国的名单是恰当的
    这项公报承认埃及的自主权利，但是它似乎把这种自主权利仅限于把——用公报中的话来说——“不具有国际利益的特征”的资产收归国有。如果这就是分歧之点的话，那末那些激烈的反应和好战的姿态——不过我仍旧希望这些姿态并不是战争准备——都是不必要的，它们的后果是令人痛心的。
    三国还一致商定召集1888年公约的各缔约国和同使用运河主要有关的其他国家在1956年8月16日在伦敦举行会议，它们并且一致同意参加这次会议。联合王国已经根据决定向二十三个国家发出邀请，这二十三个国家就是：澳大利亚、锡兰、丹麦、埃及、埃塞俄比亚、德意志联邦共和国、法国、希腊、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、意大利、日本、荷兰、新西兰、挪威、巴基斯坦、葡萄牙、西班牙、瑞典、土耳其、美国、苏联。
    印度政府在八月三日从联合王国那里接到了参加“关于苏彝士运河问题”的伦敦会议的邀请。在这以前，联合王国政府曾经不断把事态发展情况通知印度政府。
    政府认识到已经产生的局势和形成的情况是极端严重的，它已经对这个问题的各个方面——包括对邀请的答复——进行了急切和谨慎的考虑。政府还同包括埃及在内的有关国家一直进行着接触。
    政府始终很清楚，它不能参加任何事先就把要达成的结论强加在与会者身上的会议。政府同样也将拒绝参加任何备战或制裁的安排。或者是参加任何触犯埃及主权的步骤。对于应该包括在1888年公约签字国或主要使用者的范畴内的许多国家没有被列入被邀请者名单这件事情，政府也感到关切。我并不想作什么惹人厌恶的区别，但是我希望向人民院说明，把缅甸排斥在外在我们看来是一种特别令人遗憾的遗漏。南斯拉夫，由于它在1888年公约方面说来是一个继承国，而且也是一个海运国家，所以也应当列入被邀请国。因此，印度政府不认为被邀请国的名单是恰当的。
    印度参加会议决不受事先的限制和约束
    政府已经请求联合王国政府加以澄清，而且肯定认为，它参加会议决不意味着它受到联合公报所陈述的做法和原则的限制或约束。它认识到埃及不能也不会参加苏彝士运河会议，因为在这个会议中它只是一个被邀请者，而且关于召开这个会议问题并没有同它商量。
    印度政府必须对它所面临的情况作出决定。印度不是一个无关的方面。它是这条水道的主要使用者，这种纠纷对它的经济生活和发展不是没有影响的，更不必说同这有关的世界局势发展了。
    而且，印度是非常关心避免冲突的。它同埃及有友好关系，同它一起接受了万隆宣言和“五项原则”。印度也同有关的主要西方国家有良好和密切的关系。我们极为重视这些关系，这是本院和全世界都知道的。政府在作出它的决定——这不是一个容易作的决定——时所必须根据的考虑和准则是，它怎样能够最有效地致力于避免冲突，并且在不太晚以前找到和平解决办法。人民院将认识到局势的严重性，正如政府所认识的那样。
  印度最关切的是在埃及主权的基础上协商解决问题
    因此，在埃及的主权和尊严的基础上通过一切有关方面的协议来解决这个问题，并且放弃威胁的姿态和暴力，放弃双方任何一方面的片面行动，就是印度所最关切的了。
    因此，政府从联合王国获得了必要的保证，并且十分明确地说明了自己的立场。政府确信：它参加伦敦会议，并不会损害埃及的利益或是它的主权和尊严。政府感到自己所负的责任的严重性，决定接受邀请，派遣代表参加这个会议。
    政府曾经同印度尼西亚和锡兰以及大致在这个问题上同印度采取同样态度的其他国家保持紧密的联系。
    政府十分了解，这次会议不能够达成最后的决定，因为那需要埃及的同意。
    先生，我了解，人民院同政府一样严重地关心这个问题。我谨要求人民院同政府一样抱有这种希望：印度的参加会有助于争取和平解决的努力。
