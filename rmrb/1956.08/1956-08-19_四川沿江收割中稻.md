Harvesting of Mid-Season Rice Along the Yangtze River in Sichuan

(By our correspondent) Sichuan has begun its autumn harvest. Since the Beginning of Autumn, the sounds of threshing machines and rice tubs have filled the fields along the Yangtze River, from Yibin to Wanxian. The more than 400,000 mu of mid-season rice harvested in the Yibin Special District generally yielded more than 10% higher than last year. The 150,000 mu of mid-season rice in the Pingba area of ​​Kai County yielded about 30% more than last year. In the fields where the mid-season rice has been harvested, many are already cultivating ratooning rice and late autumn crops. Farmers in Luzhou, Yibin, Jiangjin, and other special districts have already planted more than 500,000 mu of corn, autumn sweet potatoes, broad beans, vetch, and other green manure and feed crops.
