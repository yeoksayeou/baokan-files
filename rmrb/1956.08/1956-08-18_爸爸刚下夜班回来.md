    Dad Just Got Back from Night Shift
    Li Xue'ao
    Child, don't make a fuss,
    Quietly put on your clothes and hat.
    Dad just got back from night shift,
    Dad just lay down to sleep.
    You ask him why he's talking in his sleep,
    That, I really don't know.
    Maybe he's dreaming that your little boat has sailed into the sea,
    Maybe he's dreaming that his "Red Arrow" [Note]
    Has flown into the sky.
    You ask him why he's smiling,
    That, I really don't know.
    Maybe it's because you've learned a new song,
    Maybe it's because his picture is up on the big-character poster again.
    Child, don't make a fuss,
    Quietly put on your clothes and hat.
    Let Dad sleep peacefully,
    "Grandpa Sun" is waving and smiling at you from the window!
    [Note] The red arrow on the production chart. Dad often tells the child about it.

    爸爸刚下夜班回来
    李学鳌
    孩子，不要吵闹，
    轻轻地穿衣戴帽。
    爸爸刚下夜班回来，
    爸爸刚躺下睡觉。
    你问他为什么说梦话，
    这我可不知道。
    也许梦见你的小轮船跑到海里了，
    也许梦见他的“红箭头”〔注〕
    飞上天了。
    你问他为什么笑，
    这我可不知道。
    也许因为你又学会一支新歌，
    也许因为他的像片又上了大字报。
    孩子，不要吵闹，
    轻轻地穿衣戴帽。
    让爸爸安静地睡吧，
    “日头爷爷”正在窗前向你招手、微笑！
    〔注〕生产图表上的红箭头。爸爸常讲给孩子听。
