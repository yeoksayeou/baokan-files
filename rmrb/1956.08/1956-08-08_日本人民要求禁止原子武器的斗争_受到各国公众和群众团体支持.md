Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in his congratulatory message to the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs: "Not only must atomic warfare be prohibited, but atomic explosion tests must also be stopped, because people are now concerned that even such explosions will cause damage to humanity."

    This congratulatory message was read out on the opening day of the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo on the 6th. The message further stated that today, humanity faces the choice between terrifying mass destruction and peaceful progress. Nehru believes that only through peaceful coexistence can the countries of the world continue to survive.

    The World Conference is receiving increasing numbers of congratulatory messages from countries around the world. Philippine President Magsaysay also sent a telegram wishing the conference success. He said that the conference, which continues to call for lasting peace and disarmament, will be supported by all peace-loving people around the world.

    The people of the world are expressing warm support for the World Conference. Representatives from international organizations such as the World Peace Council, trade unions, women's organizations, scientific workers, journalists, and from more than a dozen countries including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Belgium, and Brazil have arrived in Japan. Their participation in the conference has boosted the Japanese people's confidence in demanding a ban on nuclear weapons.

    Foreign representatives held a press conference in Tokyo on the 6th. The Secretary-General of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, Mr. Beegha, announced at the meeting that foreign delegations will fight with all their strength to ban nuclear weapons tests.

    On the afternoon of the 6th, Tokyo Governor Seiichiro Yasui held a garden party at the Prince Hotel to entertain the representatives of various countries attending the World Conference.

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from New York: Three American groups wrote to the Japanese people on the 6th, expressing support for their call to stop hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific.

    These three groups are the Catholic Worker Movement, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, and the War Resisters League. On the occasion of the Japanese people's painful commemoration of the eleventh anniversary of the atomic bombing, they expressed regret for the United States' dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They requested the Japanese Consul General in New York, Hayao Tsuchiya, to convey their support and apology to the Japanese people.

    That afternoon, representatives of these three groups braved the rain to march with placards opposing war and declaring nuclear weapons illegal.

    这封贺电六日已经在第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的东京开幕会议上被宣读。贺电又说，今天，人类面临着要在恐怖的大规模毁灭同和平进步之间作选择的局面。尼赫鲁认为，世界各国只有通过和平共处才能继续生存。
    世界大会正在收到来自世界各国的愈来愈多的贺电。菲律宾总统麦格赛赛也曾经打电报祝大会成功。他说，继续呼吁实现持久和平和裁减军备的大会，将得到全世界一切爱好和平的人们的支持。
    世界各国人民对世界大会表示热烈支持的态度。已经有世界和平理事会和工会、妇女、科学工作者、新闻工作者等国际组织，以及中国、苏联、美国、英国、法国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、瑞典、比利时、巴西等十几个国家的代表到达日本。他们的参加大会，鼓舞了日本人民要求禁止核子武器的信心。
    外国代表们六日在东京举行了记者招待会。世界科学工作者协会总书记比嘉在会上宣布，外国代表团将全力为禁止核子武器试验而斗争。

    这三个团体是天主教工作者运动、修好团契和反战同盟。他们在日本人民沉痛纪念遭受原子弹轰炸十一周年的时候，对美国向广岛和长崎投掷原子弹表示遗憾。他们请求日本驻纽约的总领事土屋隼向日本人民转达他们的支持和歉意。
