At 2:00 PM on July 31st, the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team, consisting of thirty-one members, successfully reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, a mountain with an altitude of 7,546 meters located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Thus, for the first time, human footprints were left on the peak of this mountain, known as the "Father of Ice Mountains."

The first person to attempt to climb the summit of Muztagh Ata was the famous Swedish traveler Sven Hedin. Sixty-two years ago, he rode yaks to climb the mountain, but he failed four times to reach above 6,800 meters. In 1947, the famous British mountaineer Eric Shipton, who had served as an instructor for the Himalayan expedition team, also came here. Although his servants helped him carry heavy luggage, he only勉勉强强勉勉强强勉勉强强勉勉强强勉勉强强勉勉强强managed to reach about 7,000 meters. Because of frostbite, Eric Shipton had to bow his head to this huge "pyramid"-like ice mountain.

"Father of Ice Mountains"

The Kirgiz and Tajik herdsmen call this high mountain "Muztagh Ata" or "Ayzilai Ada," meaning the "Father of Ice Mountains" or "Father of Holy Mountains" among the tens of thousands of square kilometers of mountains and ice peaks in this area.

This tall snow peak can even be seen clearly from Kashgar, which is five or six hundred li away. Every year, a huge amount of snowmelt flows from here, irrigating millions of mu of land in the Kashgar and Yarkand oases. However, heavy snow often falls on the snow-capped mountains throughout the four seasons. The accumulated snow still reaches 150 to 200 meters thick. Under the summer sun, the temperature of this snow mountain sometimes rises above 10 degrees Celsius, but as soon as a dark cloud covers the sun, the temperature immediately drops below 0 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature often drops to more than 30 degrees Celsius below zero.

This tall snow mountain has abrupt cliffs and complex icefall areas. When climbing, steps must be dug out with an ice axe to continue. Mountaineers can easily fall into ice river cracks and lose their lives if they are not careful. Above 6,800 meters, not only is there a lack of oxygen and extreme cold, but also the loose snow makes it difficult to move forward. However, the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers, with their perseverance, finally planted the national flags of China and the Soviet Union on the summit of Muztagh Ata.

Ordinary Soviet and Chinese People

"We are all ordinary Soviet people and ordinary Chinese people," I have heard the heads of the Chinese and Soviet mountaineering teams say more than once. In the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team, most of them are workers, engineers, trade union cadres from Moscow and Beijing, Harbin and Leningrad, the Urals and Anshan, as well as the road-building model worker who opened up the Chueer Mountain on the Kangzang Highway. Forty-eight-year-old Leningrad lathe operator Berezhkov, as the captain of the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team, successfully led all the activities of the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team this time. And the deputy captain of the mountaineering team, Kuzmin, an engineer from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, always took the lead in enduring hardship during each march. He often used one or two times more strength than others to open the road on the ice and snow. When returning to the camp, he stayed behind to take care of everyone and ensure their safe descent.

In the past, Chinese and Soviet athletes participated in the Patriotic War and the Liberation War along with millions of working people. Most of the older Soviet athletes served as commanders or combatants in the snow mountain troops during the Patriotic War. Many young Chinese athletes also participated in the Liberation War.

When the German invaders planted the invaders' flag on the summit of Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, it was Soviet meritorious athlete Shestokoleno and his comrades who climbed to the top of the mountain and tore down the invaders' flag.

The Honor of the Motherland

Before climbing the main peak of Muztagh Ata, the Soviet mountaineers proposed the slogan of winning glory for the people of the two great countries and making sure to climb to the top of the mountain. Many speeches emphasized that as long as they could still think, they must overcome the greatest difficulties to climb to the top and ensure the collective's safe ascent to the top. In this way, on July 26, the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers left the base camp and climbed higher step by step. After reaching the area above 5,500 meters, which is covered with ice and snow all year round, they connected every four people together with strong nylon ropes and put ice claws on the soles of their ice shoes. Above 6,800 meters, they all changed into high-mountain boots and advanced in knee-deep snow.

Some people say that in all activities, there is no friendship and cooperation more intimate than mountaineering. Indeed, the Chinese and Soviet team members marched together during the day and slept in the same bed at night. Whenever it was time to eat, the well-trained Soviet mountaineers always cared about the diet of the young Chinese team members, trying to find food that suited the Chinese taste. Soviet cinematographer Grieg was physically weaker, so the Chinese team members helped him carry the movie camera.

As they approached the top of the mountain, the difficulties increased unprecedentedly. In order to save energy, thirty-one people advanced together, stepping on the same footprints. During the break, everyone remained silent, but whenever they found their companions falling behind, someone would carry their belongings, massage their legs to promote blood circulation, so that they could continue to move forward together.

Berezhkov said: "It is precisely because everyone feels that we are an inseparable whole that it increases our infinite strength. And the congratulatory telegrams and letters from the people of China and the Soviet Union also encouraged the hearts of each of us." He said that even for a very strong athlete, it would be difficult for him to guarantee that he could reach the top without assistance. Shi Zhanchun, deputy captain of the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team, said: "The reason why we have achieved victory is also that we are closely linked to the cause of the whole people. The honor of the motherland is supporting us."

    中、苏两国人民的荣誉
    新华社记者　杨克现
    七月三十一日十四时，由三十一人组成的中、苏混合爬山队全部登上了新疆维吾尔自治区境内海拔7，546公尺的慕士塔格山顶峰。从此，这个被称为“冰山之父”的高山顶上，第一次留下了人类的足迹。
    第一个企图攀登慕士塔格山顶峰的是瑞典的著名旅行家斯文·赫定。六十二年前，他骑着牦牛登山，但是他四次也没能到达六千八百公尺以上的地方。1947年，曾经担任过喜马拉雅山考察队指导员的英国著名爬山家埃·希普顿也来到了这里。虽然他的仆人帮他背上了沉重的行囊，但是他只勉勉强强地到达了七千公尺左右的地方。因为脚冻，埃·希普顿不得不向这座巨大的“金字塔”般的冰山低头。
    “冰山之父”
    柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族牧民都把这座高山叫做“慕士塔格达”或“艾则来提阿达格”。意思是这一带数万平方公里的众山冰峰之中的
  “冰山之父”或“圣山之父”。
    这座高大的雪峰，甚至从远离五、六百华里的喀什噶尔也看得清楚。每年从这里流下了巨量的雪水，灌溉着喀什噶尔和叶尔羌绿洲数百万亩土地。但是雪山上四季经常大雪纷飞。积雪仍然达到一百五十到二百公尺厚。在夏天的阳光下，这座雪山的温度有时候上升到摄氏10度以上，但是只要有一朵乌云遮住了太阳，气温便立刻下降到摄氏零度以下。到了夜晚，温度经常降到摄氏零下30多度。
    这座高大的雪山，有着突兀的悬崖和形势复杂的冰瀑地带。爬山时必须用冰镐挖出台阶，才能继续前进。登山的运动员稍不小心，便可能掉入冰河裂缝中丧命。在六千八百公尺以上，不仅缺乏氧气和极度严寒，而且积雪疏松，使人难以前进。但是中、苏两国的爬山运动员，以坚忍不拔的意志，终于把中、苏两国国旗插在慕士塔格山顶上。
    普通的苏维埃人和中国人
    “我们都是普通的苏维埃人和普通的中国人”，我不止一次听到中、苏爬山队负责人这样说。在中、苏爬山队中，大多数人是来自莫斯科和北京、哈尔滨和列宁格勒、乌拉尔和鞍山的工人、工程师、工会工作干部，以及打通康藏公路雀儿山的筑路模范。四十八岁的列宁格勒旋工别列次基，作为中、苏爬山队的队长，他这次极成功地领导了中、苏混合爬山队的一切活动。而爬山队的副队长库兹明——一位古比雪夫水电站的工程师，他在每次行军中始终吃苦在先。他经常用比别人多一两倍的力气，在冰雪上开路。在返回营地的时候，他又留在后面照顾大家一个个地安全下山。
    中、苏运动员在过去的历史中，曾经和千百万劳动人民一起，参加了卫国战争和解放战争。大多数年长的苏联运动员在卫国战争时期，都担任了雪山部队的指挥员或战斗员。年轻的中国运动员，有不少人也参加了解放战争。
    当德寇把侵略者的旗帜插上了欧洲最高峰厄尔普鲁士顶峰的时候，是苏联功勋运动员谢多连科和他的战友攀登到山顶扯掉了侵略者的旗帜。
    祖国的荣誉
    在攀登慕士塔格山主峰之前，苏爬山运动员提出了为两个伟大国家人民争光，一定要爬到山顶的口号。许多人的发言中都强调，只要还能够思想，都一定要克服最大的困难爬到山顶，并且要保证集体安全地攀登到山顶。就这样，七月二十六日中、苏爬山队员离开了大本营，一步一步地登高。到了五千五百公尺以上终年盖着冰雪的地方以后，他们每四个人用拉力很强的尼龙绳连接在一起，在冰鞋底套上了冰爪。到了六千八百公尺以上，他们又全换上了高山用的高筒靴，在没膝的雪中前进。
    有人说，在一切活动中，再没有比爬山这种友谊合作更为亲切的了。的确，中、苏队员他们白天一起行军，晚上同床共寝。每到吃饭的时候，久经锻炼的苏联爬山队员总是关心年轻的中国队员的饮食，设法找出适合中国人口味的食品。苏联电影师格列克体力比较弱，中国队员就帮助他背上电影摄影机。
    在快到高山顶的时候，困难空前增加了。为了节省力量，三十一个人共同踏着一个脚印前进。休息的时候，大家不发一言，但是只要发现他们的伙伴掉队，就有人背上了伙伴的东西，按摩他的腿使血液流通，以便继续共同前进。
    别列次基讲道：“正是因为大家感到我们是一个不可分割的整体，所以就增加了无限的力量。而中、苏两国各地人民的贺电和来信，也都鼓舞着我们每一个人的心。”他说，即使是身体很强壮的运动员，他也很难保障他一人不要援助可以到达山顶。中、苏爬山队副队长史占春说：“我们所以取得胜利，还在于我们和全民的事业有着密切的连系。祖国的荣誉在支持着我们。”
