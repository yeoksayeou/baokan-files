    Contagion
    Gao Shiqi
    If you yawn at night, and the person next to you also yawns, can you say that he was infected by you?
    You can't say that, because yawning is a normal physiological phenomenon, and has nothing to do with contagion.
    The most obvious examples of contagion are coughs, colds, influenza, and pneumonia, all of which are related to it. A cough that lasts for a long time is very dangerous, especially a cough with tubercle bacilli.
    If a person coughs severely and emits germs everywhere, people who come into contact with him are likely to be infected. Therefore, one must cover one's mouth with a handkerchief or wear a mask when coughing, which is a matter of public health ethics.
    Generally speaking, the process of contagion includes three factors.
    The first factor is the infectious agent. This refers to germs, viruses, and parasites, all of which are invisible enemies. For a long time, they have developed the habit of parasitic life. Sometimes, they also secrete a strong toxin that wantonly destroys the cells they parasitize, which poses a great threat to human health and life.
    The second factor is the object of contagion. People and animals are likely to encounter sudden attacks by germs at any time and anywhere in their long lives, especially when they are weak and malnourished. Even the lowest forms of life can hardly escape this disaster.
    However, in higher animals and humans, due to the highly developed higher nervous system, the protective effect is very complete. Some people have strong resistance, and even if they are infected temporarily, they do not develop any clinical symptoms.
    Pavlov said: "The process of contagion is a struggle between the organism and the germs. The result of the struggle is either the failure of the enemy or the victory of the enemy." But sometimes, bacteria and humans coexist peacefully, which produces immunity. Don't forget that once this balance is lost, the disease will still break out.
    Here, we should also pay close attention to a type of person called "healthy carriers." After being infected, they do not develop symptoms themselves, but carry germs everywhere and spread contagion everywhere. These people must be exposed and eradicated in a timely manner.
    The third factor is the medium of contagion. This refers to dirty air, raw and cold water, flying dust, dirty hands, contaminated food, the excrement and utensils of patients, especially insects such as mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and lice. Their activities allow the enemies of the microbial world to gain a bridge to climb onto the human body.
    Now that autumn has arrived, this is the most active season for mosquitoes. When you find one or two mosquitoes in the corner, you should remember that the work of eliminating the four pests has not been done well. Some of these mosquitoes are carrying infectious agents—Japanese encephalitis virus or malaria protozoa—and are looking for targets! We must also be vigilant and pay attention to prevention!

    传染
    高士其
    晚上，如果你打了一个哈欠，在你身旁的人也打了一个哈欠，能不能说他是受了你的传染呢？
    不能这样说，因为打哈欠是一种普通生理现象，与传染无干。
    传染现象最显明的例子是咳嗽、伤风、流行性感冒和肺炎，都和它有关。咳嗽如果是长期经久不停的话，是很危险的，尤其是带有结核菌的咳嗽。
    一个人如果咳嗽的很厉害，到处发射病菌，和他接触的人，都有受传染的可能。所以，在咳嗽的时候，必须掩以手巾，或戴上口罩，这是公共卫生道德。
    一般说来，传染的过程，都包含着三种因素。
    第一种因素，就是传染的因子。这就是指病菌、病毒和寄生虫而言，这些都是肉眼看不见的敌人，长久以来，它们就养成寄生生活的习惯，有时候，还分泌出一种猛烈的毒素，对于寄生的细胞妄加破坏，这就造成了对人类健康与生命的莫大威胁。
    第二种因素，就是传染的对象。人和动物，在他们漫长的一生中，随时随地都会遭遇到病菌突然的袭击，尤其是当身体虚弱、营养不足的时候。这种灾祸，就是最低级的生命，也难幸免。
    不过，在高等动物和人类，由于高级神经系统非常发达，保护性的作用非常完善，有的人抵抗力强盛，就是一时受到传染，也不发生任何临床症状。
    巴甫洛夫说过：“传染的过程，就是机体和病菌之间的斗争，斗争的结果，不是敌人的失败，就是敌人的胜利。”但是，有时候细菌与人和平共处，相安无事，这就产生了免疫现象。不要忘记，这种均衡一旦失去，病仍旧会发作起来。
    在这里，我们还应当严密注意，有一种人叫做“健康带菌者”，他受了传染之后，自己不发生病状，却带着病菌到处散布、到处传染。对于这种人，要及时揭发和根治。
    第三种因素，就是传染的媒介。这是指污浊的空气、生冷的水、飞扬的尘土、污手、污染过的食物、病人的排泄物和用具而言，特别是蚊子、苍蝇、跳蚤、虱子之类的昆虫，它们的活动，使得微生物界的敌人，得到了攀登人体的桥梁。
    现在秋天到了，这是蚊子最活跃的季节，当你在墙角发现一两个蚊子的时候，应当想起，这是除四害的工作没有做好。这些蚊子，有的带着传染的因子——乙型脑炎病毒或疟疾原虫——正在寻找对象哩！我们还得提高警惕，注意预防啊！
