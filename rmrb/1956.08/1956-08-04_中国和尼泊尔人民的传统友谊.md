    The Traditional Friendship Between the Chinese and Nepalese People

    Nepal is our neighbor. For a long time in the past, China and Nepal have had close cultural relations, and the people of the two countries have a deep traditional friendship.
    In ancient Chinese historical books, Nepal was called "Nibo Luo" or written as "Ni Po Luo". Sakyamuni Buddha was born in Lumbini Park in Nepal, and the Chinese people knew about this Buddhist holy place very early. The famous Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang went to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures (starting in 629 AD and returning in 645 AD), and wrote the book "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," which also contained a simple introduction to Nepal. The book writes:
    "The country of Nibo Luo is about four thousand li in circumference and is located in the snowy mountains. The capital city of the country is about twenty li in circumference. The mountains and rivers are connected, suitable for growing grains and fruits, and produces red copper yaks." "In recent times there was a king named Angshuvarman, a great scholar, intelligent and wise, who created his own theory of phonology. He valued learning and respected virtue, and his fame spread far and wide. Southeast of the capital city there is a small pool. If a person throws fire into it, the water will burst into flames. If other objects are thrown in, they will also turn into fire."
    The "Great Capital" he mentioned is Greater Kathmandu, where there are still hot springs today. During the Tang Dynasty, there were five Chinese Buddhists who went to Nepal to study Buddhism, including Xuanzhao, Daofang, and Daosheng. These people are recorded, and there is no telling how many are not recorded.
    In the seventeenth year of the Zhenguan reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty (643 AD), Li Yibiao was sent to India as an envoy and passed through Nepal. King Naling Deva was very happy to see him and personally accompanied him to see the hot springs. In the twenty-first year of the Zhenguan reign (647 AD), Nepal sent envoys to China, bringing "spinach and scallions." Spinach is spinach. From then on, a new nutrient-rich vegetable was added to the food of the Chinese people.
    In the twenty-second year of the Zhenguan reign (648 AD), the Tang Dynasty sent Wang Xuance as an envoy to Magadha in Central India. Before he arrived, King Siladitya (Harshavardhana) died, and there was great chaos in the country. Minister Aruṇāśva established himself as king and sent troops to attack Wang Xuance. Wang Xuance and the dozens of cavalrymen he led were all captured. He escaped to Tibet and requested assistance. At that time, Princess Wencheng was in Tibet. Tibet sent 1,000 soldiers, and Nepal sent 7,000 cavalrymen, who followed Wang Xuance into Magadha and captured the rebellious minister Aruṇāśva alive. Nepal's military assistance solved the difficult problems of the Chinese envoy. In the second year of the Yonghui reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty (651 AD), King Śrī Narendradeva of Nepal sent envoys to China to present local products. China and Nepal maintained a long-term peaceful and friendly relationship.
    During the late Tang and Five Dynasties period and the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties (8th-12th centuries), due to traffic blockages, the exchanges between the Chinese and Nepalese people decreased.
    In the first year of the Zhongtong reign of the Yuan Dynasty (1260 AD), Emperor Shizu Kublai Khan ordered State Preceptor Phagpa (a Tibetan) to build a golden pagoda in Tibet. Nepalese craftsmen were famous for their superior skills, so eighty people were selected to carry out this task. Among these craftsmen, there was a need to produce a team leader, but no one dared to take on the task. A seventeen-year-old boy stepped forward and volunteered to take on this position. Others thought he was too young and not capable enough. He said, "Young in age, not young in heart." So he led a team of craftsmen away from his motherland. This young man was the great sculptor Arniko, who was later praised in the "History of Yuan" and "Biographies of Technicians". There are not many foreigners like Arniko who have biographies in China's "official history."
    As soon as Phagpa saw Arniko, he was greatly surprised and appointed him as the chief supervisor. The pagoda was completed the following year, and he requested to return to his country, but Phagpa advised him to come to the capital of the Yuan Dynasty. The clever Arniko also attracted the attention of Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan asked him, "What are your special skills?" He replied, "I have studied painting, sculpture, and gold casting." Kublai Khan showed him a bronze acupuncture statue and said to him, "This bronze statue has been damaged for a long time, can you repair it?" He said, "I haven't done it before, please allow me to try!" In the second year of Zhiyuan (1265 AD), the new bronze statue was completed, and the joints and meridians were extremely complete. No gold casting craftsman did not admire his genius. At that time, most of the statues in the temples and monasteries in the two capitals (Kaiping and Beijing) were made by Arniko. In the tenth year of Zhiyuan (1273 AD), he was appointed as "General Manager of Artisans of Various Colors." In the thirteenth year (1276 AD), envoys were sent to Nepal to pick up his wife. In the sixteenth year (1278 AD), Arniko was appointed as Grand Situ, concurrently leading the "Jiangzuo Yuan" (the royal architectural engineering institution), with the same rank as the "Prime Minister." Arniko died of illness in the tenth year of the Dade reign of Emperor Chengzong (1306 AD). A pagoda was built to bury him in Gangziyuan, Xiangshan Township, Wanping County. He was named "Duke of Liang," posthumously awarded honorary titles, and his parents and grandparents were also posthumously awarded honorary titles. Arniko personally undertook the construction and sculpture projects, including "three pagodas, nine large temples, two ancestral halls, and one Taoist palace." He also added and repaired many statues in various temples; he also manufactured some ingenious instruments such as the "armillary sphere."
    Arniko had six sons. The eldest son, Asengge, served as Grand Situ. In the second year of the Huangqing reign of Emperor Renzong (1313 AD), Wan'an Temple was repaired, and "Asengge was ordered to supervise the Buddha statues." The second son, Asula, served as "Dalu Huachi" (Secretary-General) of the "General Administration Office of Artisans of Various Colors." They were also sculptors.
    Apart from Arniko and his sons, no sculptor in Chinese history has ever received such respect from the feudal dynasty.
    Arniko had a Chinese student named Liu Yuan, who "studied the Western Indian Buddhist images." The statues he made were "wonderfully combined with divine thoughts, and the world praised them." It is said that some of the statues in Beijing's Baiyun Temple, Guangji Temple, Xiangshan Temple, and Dongyue Temple were made by Liu Yuan. Unfortunately, due to the long period of time, or due to the relocation of temples, or due to repeated repairs, it is difficult to identify them. The "Liulan Plastic" Hutong at the north entrance of Fuyou Street in Beijing is named in memory of this great sculptor, who lived here in those years.
    Arniko passed on the esoteric sculpture art, and Liu Yuan inherited and developed it. This kind of statue, with a slender waist and high bun, is lifelike and has left a deep impression on the sculptures of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Arniko and Liu Yuan made great contributions to Chinese Buddhist art.
    In the fourteenth century, the Ming Dynasty unified China. The Ming Dynasty called Nepal "Nibala". In the seventeenth year of Hongwu (1384 AD), Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty sent the monk Zhiguang to Nepal as an envoy with a jade seal and colored coins. King Madanarama of Nepal also sent envoys to China, carrying "golden pagodas, Buddha statues, famous horses, and local products," arriving in Nanjing in the twentieth year of Hongwu (1387 AD). Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty sent Zhiguang to Nepal again. In the eleventh year of Yongle (1413 AD), Yang Sanbao was sent to congratulate the new King Shakya Sangha of Nepal on his enthronement. In the sixteenth year of Yongle (1418 AD), the eunuch Deng Chengzhai was sent, and in the second year of Xuande (1427 AD), the eunuch Hou Xian was sent to Nepal, presenting fine brocade, ramie silk, and other local products. The envoys of the two countries exchanged visits and came and went continuously.
    Official books of the Qing Dynasty referred to Nepal as "Gurkha"—the name of an ethnic group in Nepal. In the late eighteenth century, armed conflicts occurred between the ruling classes of China and Nepal. But these brief, unpleasant years did not hinder the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and cultural and economic ties were quickly restored. Nepalese music was introduced to China and has been recorded. The Qing Dynasty court had "Gurkha tribal music": "The two dancers both wear red and green silk clothes, red felt hats, and red colored shoes. Each foot is tied with a string of red bells, that is, gong guli. The five singers all wrap their heads with red and green cloth, one of them wears green silk clothes and red colored shoes, the rest wear Hui clothes and red sheepskin boots. One plays the sitar, one plays the stabla, one plays the stanbule, and one plays the sarangi, totaling six people. Two of them wrap their heads with foreign brocade, and the rest wrap their heads with red and green cloth; they wear Hui clothes and red sheepskin boots. Their belts are made of various colors of silk cloth." Dala, dabla, danbule, and sarangi are all names of musical instruments, which are still used in Nepal, India, and other places today.
    Chinese culture has also spread to Nepal. Many buildings in Kathmandu have been influenced by Chinese architectural styles. Ms. Pu Sha, a member of the Nepalese cultural delegation, said: "Lychees were introduced from China, and Nepalese people also call them 'lychees,' the sounds are the same. Potatoes were also introduced from China, and Nepalese people call them 'Chinese potatoes.'"
    Pa. Sharma, head of the Nepalese cultural delegation, said: "Our two neighbors have always eagerly shared each other's best achievements in a spirit of friendly exchange. This explains why family-like feelings and respect have always dominated our relationship." He repeatedly congratulated the re-establishment of friendly relations between China and Nepal, which had been interrupted in the past few decades of this century. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people is very solid and will surely be further developed in the future. I wish the cultural exchanges between the two peoples will become more frequent, mutual understanding will become deeper, and we will work together for the cause of human peace.

    中国和尼泊尔人民的传统友谊
    中国科学院历史研究所第二所副研究员　阴法鲁
    尼泊尔是我们的邻邦。在过去长远的年代里，中国和尼泊尔一直有密切的文化关系，两国人民有深厚的传统友谊。
    中国的古代史籍中称尼泊尔为“尼波罗”，或写作“泥婆逻”。释迦牟尼佛诞生在尼泊尔的蓝毗尼园，中国人很早就知道这个佛教圣地。唐代著名的玄奘法师去印度取经（公元629年启程，645年归国），曾写成“大唐西域记”一书，其中也有关于尼泊尔的简单的介绍。书中写道：
    “尼波罗国，周四千余里，在雪山中。国大都城，周二十余里。山川连属，宜谷稼，多花果，出赤铜犛牛。”“近代有王，号鸯输伐摩，硕学聪睿，自制声明论。重学敬德，遐迩著闻。都城东南有小水池，以人火投之，水即焰起。更投余物，亦变为火。”
    他所说的“大都”即大都班尼各里，现在仍有温泉。在唐代，中国的佛教徒到尼泊尔学习佛法的有玄照、道方、道生等五人。这些人都见于记载，不见于记载的不知道有多少。
    唐太宗贞观十七年（643年），派李义表出使印度，经过尼泊尔。国王那陵提婆见了他，非常高兴，亲自陪着他去看温泉。贞观二十一年（647年），尼泊尔派使臣来中国，带来“菠薐酢菜、浑提葱”。菠薐菜就是菠菜。从此，中国人民的食物中增加了一种养分丰富的新蔬菜。
    贞观二十二年（648年），唐朝派遣王玄策出使中印度的摩揭陀国，还没有到达，国王尸罗逸多（戒日王）就死了，国内大乱。大臣阿罗那顺自立为王，发兵迎击王玄策。王玄策和他带领的几十名随从骑兵，全被俘掳。他脱身逃到西藏，要求援助。那时文成公主在西藏。西藏发兵一千人，尼泊尔发骑兵七千人，随王玄策攻入摩揭陀国，生擒乱臣阿罗那顺。尼泊尔的军事援助，为中国的使节解决了困难问题。唐高宗永徽二年（651年），尼泊尔国王尸利那连陀罗派使臣来中国赠送土产。中国和尼泊尔保持着长期的和平友好关系。
    在唐末和五代时期以及北宋、南宋时期（8—12世纪），由于交通阻隔，中国人民和尼泊尔人民的来往减少了。
    元中统元年（1260年），世祖忽必烈令国师八合斯巴（西藏人）在西藏修建黄金塔一座。尼泊尔的工匠以技术优越著名，就选派八十人来进行这项工作。在这些工匠中需要产生一个领队，大家都不敢担任。有一个十七岁的少年挺身而出，愿意担任这项职务。别人认为他年纪太小，能力不够。他说：“年幼，心不幼。”于是他率领着一队工匠离开了祖国。这个少年就是后来“元史”“方技传”上所表扬的大雕塑家阿尼哥。像阿尼哥这样在中国“正史”上立传的外国人是不多的。
    八合斯巴一看见阿尼哥，大为惊奇，派他做总监工。第二年塔成，他请求回国，八合斯巴劝他到元朝的首都来。聪明的阿尼哥又受到忽必烈的注意。忽必烈问他：“你有什么特长？”他回答：“学过绘画雕塑铸金的技艺。”忽必烈让他看一座针灸铜像，向他说：“这个铜像年久缺坏，你能够重新修补起来吗？”他说：“没有做过，请允许我试试吧！”至元二年（1265年），新铜像做成，关节脉络都极完备，铸金的工匠没有不佩服他的天才的。当时两京（开平、北京）寺观中的神像多半出于阿尼哥之手。至元十年（1273年），任命他作“诸色人匠总管”。十三年（1276年）派使臣到尼泊尔接了他的夫人来。十六年（1278年），任命阿尼哥为大司徒，兼领“将作院”（皇家的建筑工程机构），官级和“丞相”相同。成宗大德十年（1306年）阿尼哥病死，建塔葬于宛平县香山乡冈子原，封为“凉国公”，追赠荣誉爵衔，并追赠他的父母和祖父母以荣誉爵衔。阿尼哥一生所亲自担任的建筑及塑造工程，计有“塔三、大寺九、祠祀二、道宫一”，其他在各庙中增塑和修补的神像还很多；也制造过“浑天仪”等一些奇巧器物。
    阿尼哥有六个儿子。长子阿僧哥曾任大司徒。仁宗皇庆二年（1313年）修万安寺，“令阿僧哥提调其佛像”。次子阿述腊曾任“诸色人匠总管府”的“达鲁花赤”（秘书长）。也都是雕塑家。
    除了阿尼哥父子，在中国历史上没有一个雕塑家曾经受到封建王朝这样的尊重。
    阿尼哥有一个中国学生叫刘元，“学西天梵像”。他造的像，“神思妙合，天下称之”。相传北京的白云观、广济寺、香山寺、东岳庙中有一些神像出于刘元之手。可惜时代久远，或因寺庙迁移，或因历次修补，已经不易辨识。现在北京府右街北口的“留蓝塑”胡同，就是为纪念这位大雕塑家而命名的，当年他在这里居住过。
    阿尼哥传来的是密教的雕塑艺术，刘元承继之后又加以发展。这种造像，细腰高髻，栩栩如生，给明清两代的雕塑留下了深刻的影响。阿尼哥和刘元在中国佛教美术上都有很大的贡献。
    十四世纪，明朝统一了中国。明代称尼泊尔为“尼八剌”。洪武十七年（1384年），明太祖派僧智光持玺书彩币，出使尼泊尔。尼泊尔国王马达纳罗摩也派使臣来中国，携带“金塔、佛像及名马、方物（土产）”，于洪武二十年（1387年）到达南京。明成祖派智光再次出使尼泊尔。永乐十一年（1413年）派杨三保庆贺尼泊尔新国王沙葛新的即位。永乐十六年（1418年）派中官邓诚斋，宣宗宣德二年（1427年）派中官侯显出使尼泊尔，赠送绒锦、紵丝等方物。两国的使臣互相聘问，来往不绝。
    清代的官书称尼泊尔为“廓尔喀”——尼泊尔的一个民族的名称。十八世纪末叶，中国的统治阶级和尼泊尔的统治阶级之间曾发生过武装冲突。但这短暂的不愉快的年份并没有妨害两国人民的传统友谊，而且很快地就恢复了文化上和经济上的联系。尼泊尔的音乐传入中国，已见于记载，清代的宫廷里有“廓尔喀部乐”：“司舞二人俱衣红绿绸衣，戴红猩毡帽，著红彩履。每足各系红铃一串，即公古哩。司歌五人，俱以红绿布缠头，内一人衣绿绸衣，著红彩履，余衣回子衣，著红羊皮靴，司达拉一人，司达布拉一人，司丹不勒一人，司萨朗济一人，共六人。内二人以洋锦缠头，余皆以红绿布；衣回子衣，著红羊皮靴。其带均以杂色绸布为之。”达拉、达布拉、丹不勒、萨朗济都是乐器名，至今仍然在尼泊尔、印度等地使用着。
    中国文化也传到了尼泊尔。加德满都的许多建筑物都受了中国建筑形式的影响。尼泊尔文化代表团团员布·沙女士说：“荔枝是从中国传去的，尼泊尔人也称它‘荔枝’，声音相同。马铃薯也是从中国传去的，尼泊尔人称它为‘中国马铃薯’”。
    尼泊尔文化代表团巴·夏尔马团长说：“我们这两个邻居一直以一种友好的互通有无的精神，渴望着分享彼此最好的成就。这就说明了为什么如家庭般的情感和尊重一直主导着我们之间的关系。”对于中尼两国重新恢复了在本世纪过去的几十年中曾经中断的友好关系，他再三表示庆贺。中尼两国人民的传统友谊是非常巩固的，今后一定会得到更大的发展。祝两国人民的文化交流日益频繁，相互了解日益深刻，共同为人类的和平事业而努力。
