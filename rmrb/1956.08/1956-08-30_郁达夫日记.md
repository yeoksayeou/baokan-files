Yu Dafu's Diary
Editor's Note: The unpublished original diary of the late writer Mr. Yu Dafu was discovered in the author's hometown of Fuyang, Zhejiang. This diary starts from September 8, 1929, and ends on June 17, 1930, with some missing parts in the middle. We have selected some excerpts to be published here.

1930 Shanghai

January 10th, Friday, Sunny. [Note]
It has been a long time since my last article was published in the Beixin Weekly. If a person avoids all activities in the world and regards the ups and downs of today's affairs with an extremely indifferent attitude, then he can easily become eccentric. This is my recent mood. There is no doubt that most of my contemporaries will laugh at me and slander everything I see or do. However, time is the best judge. I place my only hope in the coming era. Let the heroes of the era play the roles of heroes, I wait, until the snow of last year melts away.
Tomorrow is Saturday again. Before I breathe my last, I must persist in my work—writing "Mirage."

February 1st, Saturday (Lunar New Year's Day), Clear and refreshing.
It feels like spring. The Beginning of Spring is in three days. I hope that my creativity can also escape from the dead end of hibernation from now on.
Today I read "The Flight" by a female writer Muriel Hine, which was a bit interesting. In short, the psychological descriptions of women, there are some aspects that must be described by women. I had previously read this female writer's "Autumn", which was also a work above the horizon. After reading it, I didn't feel cheated. There are probably many unknown writers' creations like this, but it's a pity that I don't have the time to read more.
In the afternoon, an agent from Anhui University came to visit, explaining that the university treated me harshly because no one was in charge, and invited me to dinner. I felt extremely unhappy.

February 17th, Monday (the nineteenth day of the first month), Sunny and warm.
It really feels like spring. It felt very hot sitting in the car. I hadn't read the newspaper for several days. When I arrived in Jiaxing, I was eager to know some news from the outside world. I bought a copy of the North China Daily News. After reading it, I realized that the Central Plains was about to have another war. The Chiang Kai-shek exchange government failed to collapse last time. This time, it probably won't be reliable. Let's see how Yan Xishan's magic weapon works.
I got home in the evening, and I was extremely tired. I drank a pound of wine with dinner, got drunk, and went to bed early.

February 20th, Thursday (the twenty-second day of the first month), Sunny.
I went out to buy newspapers in the morning. The war between Chiang and Yan seemed inevitable. I went to Hongkou and bought several novels.
I visited Mr. Lu Xun in the afternoon and talked until night.
It rained in the evening. I received a telegram from Peking University urging me to leave.

May 1st, Thursday (the third day of the fourth month), a gloomy and rainy day.
A murderous aura permeated the concession. I stayed indoors, not daring to take a step out. One hundred and seven representatives of the demonstration movement have been imprisoned. It is unlikely that there will be a parade today. The power of warlords and imperialists is indeed great, but this is like a lid on a steam can. The steam in the can is constantly boiling. Sooner or later, it will probably explode one day.
Today, to express my respect for those who have been imprisoned, I will not read books or do anything all day, which can be regarded as a disguised expression of grief. Beixin sent one hundred yuan in the afternoon.
I went to bed early in the evening. The affected area was not very painful.

May 29th, Thursday (the second day of the fifth month), Clear and refreshing.
I got up at ten in the morning and read a Japanese novel, which was not very good.
In the afternoon, I went out and bought Willa Cather's novel "Death Comes For The Archbishop" at a used bookstore. This is the only novel that this female novelist wrote with a foreign background, so it's probably a bit different from her previous works.
I went to the bookstore to look at the newly published books, and I only felt that there were more new, crudely made things. Maybe I myself have been eliminated by the times. There really wasn't a single new book that was worth reading.

May 30th, Friday (the third day of the fifth month), Cloudy and sunny.
Today is a memorial day, the day five years ago when British imperialists massacred Chinese people on Nanjing Road. I didn't go out all day. Someone came in the afternoon to tell me news from the streets, saying that security was tight and six or seven people distributing leaflets had been arrested.

June 9th, Monday (the thirteenth day of the fifth month), Clear and refreshing.
My hemorrhoids have healed nine-tenths. When I got up in the morning, I felt light and quick. I can work hard from now on.
In the morning, I read Kagetsu's "Yuan" and wrote a letter to a young writer. I have to prepare to write "Mirage" from now on.
I took a nap in the afternoon and got up at three o'clock. Another young writer came to visit. I should definitely not meet with these idle young people in the future, because I don't have that much free time to provide them with conversation material. I went out of the West Gate in the evening and bought two kinds of modern people's poetry.
The moon was bright and the wind was strong in the evening. The weather was really wonderful.

### 郁达夫日记

专栏：

    郁达夫日记
    编者按：已故作家郁达夫先生的未发表的日记原稿，是在作者的家乡浙江富阳发现的。这本日记自1929年9月8日起，至1930年6月17日止，中间有残缺处。我们选录了一些发表在这里。
    一九三○年上海
    一月十日。星期五，晴。〔注〕
    从最近一篇文章在北新周刊上发表以来，时间已经很久了。一个人如果回避了世上的一切活动，并且用一种极端冷淡的态度来看待今天的人事浮沉的话，那他是很容易变得怪僻的。这就是我近来的心情。毫无疑问，大部分我的同代人都会笑话我，并且诽谤我所看到或做的每一件事情。但是，时间是最好的裁判者。我把唯一的希望寄托在即将到来的时代上。让时代的英雄们扮演英雄的角色吧，我等待着，一直到去年的雪也融化了为止。
    明天又是星期六了。在我咽气以前，我要坚持我的工作——写“蜃楼”。
    二月一日，星期六，（旧历正月初三），晴爽。
    是春天的样子了，三日后就立春，我希望自己的创作力也能够从此而脱出冬眠的绝境。
    今天读一位女作家　MurielHine　的　The　Flight，还有点趣味。总之女性的心里（理）描写，是有些地方非要由女子来描写不可的。从前曾读过这女作家的Autumn，也是水平线以上的作品，读了还不觉得是被骗了。无名作家的创作，大约像这样的总也不少，可惜没有工夫来多读一些。
    午后有安徽大学的代理人来访，说明该大学之所以待我苛刻者，实在因为负责无人之故，并约我去吃了一餐晚饭，真感到了万分的不快。
    二月十七日，星期一（正月十九），晴暖。
    大有春天的样子了。坐在车里觉得热得很。几日不看报，到了嘉兴，急欲知道一点外界的消息，买字林西报一份，读后才晓得中原又将大战了，蒋交易所政府，前次不倒，这一次大约总靠不住了，且看看阎老西的法宝如何罢。
    晚上到家，人也倦极。晚饭饮酒一斤，醉倒了，早睡。
    二月二十日，星期四，（正月二十二日），晴。
    午前出去买报，蒋阎的战争，似已不可免了。过虹口，买小说数册。
    午后访鲁迅氏，谈到了夜。
    晚上雨，接北大来电，催我动身。
    五月一日，星期四，（四月初三），是阴惨的雨天。
    租界上杀气横溢，我蛰居屋内，不敢出门一步。示威运动代表者们一百零七人都已被囚，大约今天的游行，是不会再有了。军阀帝国主义者的力量真大不过，然而这也犹之乎蒸汽罐上的盖，罐中蒸气不断地在涌沸，不久之后，大约总有一天要爆发的。
    今天为表示对被囚者们的敬意，一天不看书，不做事情，总算是一种变相的志哀。午后北新送钱一百元来。
    晚上早睡，患部痛不甚剧。
    五月二十九日，星期四，（五月初二），晴爽。
    午前十时起床，读了一篇日本人的小说，不大好。
    午后出去，在旧书铺买　WillaCather　的小说　Death　Comes ForThe Archbishop，这是这一位女小说家作的唯一的以异国为背景的小说，大约是和她的以前诸作，总有点不同。
    上书铺去看了出版的新书之类，只觉得新的粗制滥造的东西多起来了，或者是我自己为时代所淘汰了罢，新出的东西，可以看看的，真一册都没有。
    五月三十日，星期五（五月初三），阴晴。
    今天是纪念日，是五年前英帝国主义者在南京路惨杀中国人的日子。一天不出去，午后有人来告以街市上的消息，说戒备森严，捉去散传单者六七人。
    六月九日，星期一，（五月十三），晴爽。
    痔漏已好了九分，早晨起来只觉得一身轻快，以后可以努力做事情了。
    午前将花袋氏的“缘”读了，写了一封信给一位文学青年。以后是不得不预备写“蜃楼”了。
    午后小睡，三时起床，又有一位文学青年来访。以后当绝对不接见这一类有闲的青年，因为我没有这许多闲工夫来供他们的谈助。旁晚出西门，买近人词两种。
    晚上月明风紧，天气真好极了。
