    Simplify Procedures for Transferring Cadres
    I work in personnel, in the Personnel Section of the Third Engineering Division of the Ministry of Railways Tunnel Engineering Company. In order to solve the problem of couples working in different places, we have contacted some departments. But the responses we received were: too busy to transfer, requires approval from the Provincial Party Committee.
    Similar situations are quite common at present. In order to quickly solve the problem of couples working in different places, it is suggested that the State Council Personnel Bureau make regulations in this regard to simplify the procedures for transferring cadres. Sun De'ai

    简化调动干部的手续
    我是做人事工作的，在铁道部隧道工程公司第三工程处人事科工作。为了解决夫妇不在一块工作问题，我们曾和一些部门取得了联系。但得到的答复是：工作忙，不能调，需要经过省委同意。
    类似这样的情况，目前相当普遍。为了迅速解决夫妇不在一起工作的问题，建议国务院人事局能在这方面做出规定，简化调动干部的手续。　孙德爱
