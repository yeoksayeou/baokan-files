    When the trams in Beijing are running, in addition to making a "ding-ding" sound, they sometimes emit a piercing shriek. The more frequently and longer this shriek is sounded, especially on busier streets, the more it adds to the noise in the city. Shanghai's bustling areas are no less busy than Beijing's, but we have never heard the trams making such shrieking noises there, and there have been no traffic accidents because the trams do not shriek. We hope that the trams in Beijing will try to avoid making shrieking noises as much as possible when they are running.

    不要发出刺耳的怪叫声
    北京市的电车开行时，除了发出叮叮的声音外，有时还发出一种刺耳的怪叫声。这种怪叫的声音，在比较热闹的街上，鸣得越多，越长，因而增加了市内吵杂声音。上海市的热闹地区不比北京少，但是却没有听到过电车怪叫的声音，也并没有因电车不发出怪叫声就发生交通事故。希望北京市的电车开行时，尽量避免发出怪叫的声音。
