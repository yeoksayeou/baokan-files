I am visiting your beautiful, peace-loving country with particularly pleasant feelings. Now, I bid farewell to this beautiful, peace-loving country with the same feelings. Dear Indonesian friends, I have stayed in your country for about ten days. During these ten days, thanks to the excellent arrangements of President Sukarno and your government, I was able to visit famous cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, and Yogyakarta, as well as Bali, and had extensive contact with the hardworking and courageous Indonesian people. The diligence and courage of your people, the unanimous love for freedom of your entire nation, the abundance of resources and the magnificence of the mountains and rivers of your motherland, and especially the warm welcome given to me everywhere, have left an indelible impression on me. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my gratitude once again to the Indonesian government and people.

Visiting Indonesia has made me more keenly aware of the greatness of the Bandung Spirit. A year ago, in your famous city of Bandung, representatives of twenty-nine Asian and African countries gathered together for the first time as sovereign and equal nations, many of which had only recently been liberated from colonialism. The Chinese people are proud to have played a role in such a great event. This conference allowed the Asian and African peoples to fully express their national aspirations and greatly advanced the struggle to safeguard peace in Asia, Africa, and the world.

When recalling the preparations for the Asian-African Conference and the proceedings of the conference, one must express gratitude to the five initiating countries: India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon, for their initiative and lofty ideals. One must also thank the Indonesian government and people for the excellent arrangements made for the conference and the appropriate atmosphere provided. Particularly outstanding was President Sukarno's opening address, which set the tone for the entire course of the conference, and equally outstanding was Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's skillful leadership in guiding such a complex conference to complete the discussion of the entire agenda. With the outstanding contributions of other participants and the enthusiastic support of many other peoples and countries, the Asian-African Conference achieved great success.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung more than a year ago signaled the beginning of a new era in Asia and Africa. In the short decade since the end of World War II, earth-shattering changes have taken place in these two regions. During this period, more than 1.2 billion people have shaken off colonial oppression, gained liberation, and begun to rebuild their countries.

The Asian-African Conference showed that this change has altered the balance of power in the world. The old colonial system, which once served as a reserve force and foundation for imperialist countries, is disappearing from the stage. In fact, the days when imperialists could order the Asian and African peoples around and use them as tools for wars, plunder, and racial discrimination are gone forever. The Asian-African Conference showed that such a large number of people have emerged as a force based on their own rights, determined to completely eliminate the vicious colonial system and determined to strive for friendly cooperation between countries and between peoples. This shift in trend is of great significance.

What is particularly noteworthy about the Asian-African Conference is the spirit manifested by this major political event of our time. After all, the countries participating in the conference were extremely different in economic and social systems. Their religious and political beliefs varied greatly. However, the conference showed that the solidarity between countries transcended these differences, allowing everyone to focus on the most pressing issues of these regions and this era: independence, peace, and progress. The reason is simple: the factors uniting these countries outweighed the factors dividing them, and the common history of suffering from and fighting against colonial oppression was a major factor among them. Even those who went to Bandung with different intentions found that this was the mainstream of the conference. The final result was the unanimous adoption of the drafted resolutions. This further greatly promoted the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples, which, although still growing, has already had a great impact on regional and worldwide affairs.

The historic achievements attained at the Asian-African Conference are called the "Bandung Spirit." Inspired by this spirit, the peoples of Asia and Africa have achieved many victories in the past year in the struggle against colonialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of their own independence.

Sudan, Tunisia, and Morocco have broken free from foreign control. Algerian patriots are waging an unyielding battle for the right to national self-determination. Arab countries, led by Egypt, have taken steps to defend their sovereignty and thwart the various conspiracies of imperialists to drag them into aggressive military alliances. Today, Egypt is completely independent. For the first time in seventy years, it has completely shaken off the occupation of foreign troops. This is a great victory for the Egyptian people and deserves our most ardent congratulations. Recently, Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal. This is a legitimate action taken by a sovereign state, and we fully support it.

In Indonesia, you have passed laws abolishing the Round Table Conference Agreement and established a province in West Irian. In Japan, the movement to free Japan from American control is growing stronger and stronger. The broad masses of the Japanese people have expressed their desire to establish normal relations with their two neighbors, China and the Soviet Union.

Today, the most important fact in the political life of the Middle East and Southeast Asia is the resolute resistance of the peoples of various countries to the military blocs instigated by imperialist countries. In recent months, more than one politician in both the East and the West has regretted not seeing this point. Even in those Eastern countries that have already joined these blocs, the Bandung Spirit is at work. In these countries, people are increasingly openly expressing doubts about whether the path their countries have been led down is wise. Time and facts have exposed the pretense that these blocs are for the defense against so-called subversion and aggression; these blocs have now been seen through as conspiracies to transfuse the blood of the Asian and African peoples into the dying colonial system. No Eastern people are willing to knowingly participate in such conspiracies.

These facts and many other facts show that the consensus and united action of the Asian and African peoples have become a decisive force in the ongoing struggle against colonialism. Today, no major issue concerning these regions can be resolved without the participation of Asian and African countries. Those who previously had no say have regained their say. We use this say to speak out in unison against the harm caused to any of us by foreign forces. This explains why the nationwide movement in India to recover Goa, Indonesia's demand for the recovery of West Irian, China's demand for the recovery of its own territories, such as Taiwan and other islands, and the struggle of Malaya and other peoples for their own independence have received universal and unanimous support.

The solidarity of the Asian and African peoples has also enabled their governments to play an increasingly important role in international affairs. This was clearly seen at the Tenth United Nations General Assembly, when the concerted action of Asian and African countries played an unprecedentedly prominent role. At the initiative of Asian and African member states, the issue of sharp protests against colonialism was placed on the agenda, despite fierce opposition from colonial countries and their supporters. In the draft human rights covenants, a clause on national self-determination was included, also despite the opposition of the colonialists. The failure of colonial countries to provide assistance to their trust territories in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter has been fully exposed in the United Nations Trusteeship Council. It is no secret that one of the reasons why certain countries want to deprive China of its legitimate status in various United Nations agencies is because they fear the voice of our 600 million people, and we will certainly support the activities of the Asian-African group in the United Nations to help expose the crimes of colonialism and arouse popular indignation against them.

The solidarity of the Asian and African peoples, as manifested by the Bandung Spirit, also exerts its influence on world affairs in various other ways. Evidence of this is the widespread endorsement by peoples of all countries of the Five Principles and the Ten Principles unanimously agreed upon at the Bandung Conference as Asia's answer to the current world's problems. These principles are the basis for the growing sincere relations and cooperation between us. They have also played a very good role in promoting peace and friendly relations far beyond Asia and Africa. Many peace-loving countries and broader strata of people recognize these principles and put them into practice. It should be mentioned that the recent joint communiques issued by the Soviet and British leaders and the Soviet and French leaders respectively contain the essence of the Five Principles. This is nothing new for the Soviet Union, but it is certainly the first time that several major Western powers have formally recognized the principles of peaceful coexistence as the norm for international behavior in bilateral documents. Of course, this is to be welcomed. And we hope that this trend will be further developed, especially that Western countries can have this development in their relations with Eastern countries.

Since gaining liberation, many Asian and African countries have adopted a stance independent of any type of bloc. The political leaders of these countries have correctly refused to participate in the military alliances fostered by imperialist countries. They condemn these alliances, accusing them of expanding colonial aggression and attempting to expand the arms race, thereby subjecting the Asian and African peoples to the scourge of this terrible burden. By adopting this just stance, these countries have created insurmountable obstacles for some who seek to exploit differences in the world's political and economic systems to play a disruptive role in regional and global issues. As a countermeasure, these Asian and African countries, in their foreign relations, emphasize those factors that allow countries to set aside differences and cooperate on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Today, this independent and autonomous stance has become the policy of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa. Since this stance has such great power, it is bound to have an impact on the international situation. In fact, this stance has become an important factor in fostering a general mood of peace throughout the world. This stance has achieved such an important position that all countries must express their attitude towards it.

As everyone knows, China is a socialist country in terms of social system, and we uphold peace, democracy, and socialism. As such, perhaps you may be interested in our view on the issue of an independent and autonomous stance.

Let me state frankly that, since we believe that there is more than one road to achieving our desired goals of peace and justice, we fully understand the view of some Asian and African countries that they feel they can play their greatest role in this struggle by not joining any side. There is no contradiction here. The reason why we all pursue the same goals is the logical development dictated by the historical conditions of these regions. As for the different paths we take in pursuing these goals, they are also the logical development of the unique historical conditions of each country. There are some common ideas that dominate the entire lives of us Easterners, and here are just a few examples: on the one hand, we insist on stopping foreign forces from interfering in our internal affairs; on the other hand, we focus on the arduous task of building our countries, and to carry out construction, peace is a fundamental prerequisite. Our common history and common goals allow us to properly view the differences between us, thereby reducing these differences to their proper proportions, and to practice a high degree of cooperation among us in order to maintain normal and beneficial relations between countries with different systems.

However, there are some places where people are attacking the independent and autonomous stance taken by some Asian countries. They say it is "outdated" and "immoral." They claim that this stance does not follow the line of "not pleasing either side." They deduce that if a country maintains this stance, it is "indifferent to the fate of others." Among these people, there seems to be some confusion in the interpretation and requirements of this concept. Some people think that if there is to be neutrality, then this neutrality is impractical, but in action it is of course beneficial to their side. But now let us look at the real content of this attack and confusion! What angers these people is that even those who maintain an independent stance openly state that they hate the dangerous military "convention craze" and "position of strength" policies that interfere in the affairs of other regions and other countries. What displeases these people is that the Eastern peoples consider colonialism to be the main danger and equate military conventions instigated by imperialism with colonialism. What worries these people is that those who take an independent stance actually actively advocate that everyone should enjoy justice and actively maintain peace at the same time. In fact, what they are attacking is mainly this point.

We in China do not have any confusion about the independent and autonomous stance of some Asian and African countries, nor do we feel angry, displeased, or worried. We do not attack this stance. We greatly appreciate this stance because it helps to realize the wishes of all Asian and African peoples and expands the possibilities of world peace. We recognize that, although our social systems are different, this does not prevent us from respecting each other's wishes, and that our relationship can be the most friendly and cooperative.

I think we have proven this many times, especially after the Bandung Conference. China is one of the countries that initiated the Five Principles, and since the formulation of these principles, we have always abided by them. We have actively worked to expand the influence of the Five Principles to other parts of the world. We also support the Ten Principles formulated at the Asian-African Conference. China has consistently strived to consolidate already established friendly relations and to create conditions for friendly relations where friendly relations are not enough or lacking, regardless of political and economic systems, and regardless of whether countries are large or small, near or far. We have greatly expanded our trade and cultural exchanges and strived for further expansion. Most importantly, we have consistently sympathized with and supported all peoples who are fighting for national self-determination and national construction. This is how the Chinese people are united with all the peoples of Asia and Africa and the peace-loving people of the world.

I think it goes without saying that everything I have just said is directly reflected in the existing good relations between China and Indonesia. But please let me add that this relationship is something that the Chinese people are extremely happy about. We hope that we can further improve and strengthen our ties with you, and we guarantee to do our best in this regard.

We also hope to maintain this close relationship with all our Asian and African sister countries. Because we firmly believe that our history clearly teaches us that only by strengthening our solidarity and cooperation, only by faithfully adhering to the Bandung Spirit, can we all make progress and help each other in the historic task of eliminating our economic and cultural backwardness. At the same time, only by adhering to this path of progress can we fully play our role in the great struggle to safeguard world peace.

May all countries in Asia and Africa achieve independence and freedom!

Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples!

Long live world peace and international cooperation!

    万隆精神和亚非人民之间的团结
    宋庆龄八月二十二日在印度尼西亚共和国电台发表的演说
    我以特别愉快的心情访问了你们这个美丽的、爱好和平的国家。现在我也以同样的心情向这个美丽的、爱好和平的国家告别。亲爱的印度尼西亚朋友们，我在你们国家已经逗留了大约十天。在这十天中，由于苏加诺总统和你们的政府的出色的安排，我能够访问了雅加达、万隆和日惹等名城及峇里岛，并且同勤劳和勇敢的印度尼西亚人民进行了广泛的接触。你们人民的勤劳和勇敢，你们全国人民一致对于自由的热爱，你们祖国物产的丰富和山河的壮丽，特别是到处给予我的热烈欢迎，都给我留下不可磨灭的印象。请允许我利用这个机会对印度尼西亚政府和人民再一次表示感谢。
    访问印度尼西亚，使我更加亲切地体会到万隆精神的伟大。一年以前，在你们的名城万隆，二十九个亚非国家的代表第一次作为有自主权和平等的国家聚会一堂，这些国家中有许多是最近才从殖民主义下解放出来的。中国人民为在这样伟大的事件中也起了一份作用而感到自豪。这次会议使亚非人民得以充分表达他们的民族愿望，并且大大推进了维护亚非和世界和平的斗争。
    在回想起亚非会议的筹备工作和会议的进行情况时，人们就必须对五个发起国家，印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦和锡兰表示感谢，感谢它们的倡议和远大的理想。人们还必须感谢印度尼西亚政府和人民，感谢他们为会议作了良好的布置，提供了适当的气氛。特别出色的是苏加诺总统的开幕词，这篇演说确定了会议整个进程的气氛，同样出色的是沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理老练地领导了这样一个复杂的会议完成了对全部议程的讨论。加上其他与会者的卓越贡献和其他许多人民和国家的热烈支持，亚非会议获得了伟大的成就。
    一年多以前在万隆举行的亚非会议，显示出在亚非两洲已经开始的一个新纪元。在第二次世界大战结束以来的短短十年中，这两个地区发生了惊天动地的变化。在这个时期，十二亿以上的人摆脱了殖民压迫，得到了解放，并且开始重新建设他们的国家。
    亚非会议表明，这一变化已经改变了世界力量的对比。一度作为帝国主义国家后备力量和基础的旧殖民主义制度，正在从舞台上消失。事实上，帝国主义分子可以对亚非人民发号施令，把他们当作战争、掠夺和种族歧视政策的工具的日子已经一去不复返了。亚非会议表明，这样众多的人民已经根据自己的权利作为一支力量出现，他们决心彻底消除恶毒的殖民主义制度，并且决心为各国之间和各国人民之间的友好合作而努力。这种在趋向上的转变，意义是十分重大的。
    亚非会议特别引人注意的是当代这一重大政治事件所表现出来的精神，毕竟，参加会议的国家在经济和社会的制度上是极为不同的。他们的宗教和政治信仰差别很大。但是会议却显示出，各国之间的团结一致超越了这些分歧，使大家可以集中全力来对付这些地区和这个时代的最迫切的问题：独立、和平和进步。理由很简单，那就是，把这些国家团结在一起的因素超过了分裂它们的因素，而它们都有过遭受殖民主义压迫和同殖民主义压迫作斗争的共同历史，就是其中主要的因素。连那些怀着不同的意图到万隆去的人，也发现这一点是这个会议的主流。最后的结果是全体一致通过草拟的各项决议。这就进一步大大促进了亚非人民的团结，这种团结虽然还在茁长，可是已经在地区性的和全世界的事务中产生了极大的影响。
    人们把亚非会议上所获得的历史性成就叫作“万隆精神”。在这种精神的鼓舞下，亚非两洲人民在过去一年内，在反殖民主义、争取和维护自己的独立的斗争中，获得了许多胜利。
    苏丹、突尼斯和摩洛哥已经摆脱了外国的控制。阿尔及利亚爱国者正在为争取民族自决的权利而进行着不屈不挠的战斗。以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家已经采取了步骤，来保卫它们的主权和挫败帝国主义者把他们拖进侵略性军事联盟的各种阴谋。今天，埃及已经完全独立。它在七十年来第一次完全摆脱了外国军队的占领，这是埃及人民的一个伟大的胜利，值得我们最热切地祝贺。最近埃及宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有。这是主权国家所采取的正当行动，我们完全支持这一行动。
    在印度尼西亚，你们已经通过了法案，废除圆桌会议协定，并且在西伊里安设省。在日本，争取使日本摆脱美国控制的运动正日益高涨和壮大。日本人民大众已经表示了要同他们的两个邻邦中国和苏联建立正常关系的愿望。
    今天，在中东和东南亚政治生活中最重要的事实，是各国人民对帝国主义国家所策动的军事集团的坚决反抗。最近几个月来，东方和西方都有不止一个政治家由于没有看到这一点而成为后悔不及的人。甚至在那些已经参加了这些集团的东方国家中，万隆精神也在发生作用。在这些国家里，人们对于他们的国家被引导走上的道路是否明智越来越公开表示怀疑。时间和事实已经揭穿这样一种饰词，那就是，这些集团是为了防御所谓颠复和侵略；这些集团现在已经被人看穿是把亚非人民的鲜血输送给垂死的殖民主义制度的阴谋。东方人民谁也不愿明知故犯地参预这种阴谋。
    这些事实和许多其他事实表明，亚非人民的一致见解和团结行动，对于在继续进行中的反殖民主义斗争，已经成为决定性的力量。今天，没有一个有关这些地区的重大问题可以没有亚非国家的参加而得到解决。以前没有发言权的人已经争回了他们的发言权。我们利用这种发言权，齐声疾呼，反对外来势力对我们之中任何人所造成的损害。这就说明了，印度收回果阿的全国性运动，印度尼西亚要求收回西伊里安，中国要求收回台湾和其他岛屿等自己的领土，马来亚和其他人民争取自己的独立，为什么得到了普遍一致的支持。
    亚非人民的团结也使他们的政府在国际事务中发挥越来越重要的作用。这一点在第十届联合国大会上看得很清楚，当时亚非国家的行动一致发挥了空前卓越的作用。在亚非会员国家的倡议下，对殖民主义提出尖锐抗议的议题列入了议程，尽管殖民国家及其支持者激烈地反对。在人权公约草案中，同样不顾殖民主义者的反对而列入了一项关于民族自决权的条款。殖民国家不按照联合国宪章的规定对于他们所托管的领土给以帮助，这种情况在联合国托管理事会得到充分的揭露。某些国家所以要剥夺中国在联合国各机构中的合法地位，其原因之一就是因为他们害怕我们六万万人民的声音，这一点已经不是什么秘密了，而我们是一定会支持联合国亚非集团的这种活动，协助暴露殖民主义的罪行，并且激起人民对它们的义愤的。
    由万隆精神表现出来的亚非人民的团结也以别的种种方式对世界事务发挥它的影响。证明这一点的是，作为亚洲对当前世界各项问题的答案的五项原则和万隆会议一致同意的十项原则，得到了各国人民的广泛拥护。这些原则是我们之间日益发展的诚挚关系和合作的基础。它们对于促进远在亚非以外的地方的和平和友好关系也起了非常好的作用。许多爱好和平的国家和更为广泛的各阶层人民承认这些原则，并且付诸实施。应该提到，在最近苏英领导人员和苏法领导人员分别发表的会谈公报中，都包含了五项原则的实质内容。对苏联来说这不是什么新鲜的事，但是这肯定是几个西方大国第一次在双边文件中正式承认把这些和平共处的原则当作国际行为的规范。当然，这是应该欢迎的。我们并且希望这种趋势有更进一步的发展，特别是希望西方国家在他们同东方国家的关系中能够有这种发展。
    许多亚非国家自从得到解放以后，采取了独立于任何类型的集团之外的立场。这些国家的政治领袖们正确地拒绝参加帝国主义国家所扶植的军事联盟。他们谴责这些联盟，指责它们是扩大殖民侵略和企图扩大军备竞赛，从而使亚非人民遭受这一可怕的重担的祸害。由于采取了这种正义的立场，这些国家就替某些人布下了难以逾越的障碍，这些人试图利用世界上政治和经济的制度的差别，以便在地区性和世界性问题上起破坏的作用。作为对策，这些亚非国家在对外关系中，强调那些使各国可以撇开分歧并且根据平等互利的条件实行合作的因素。今天，这种独立自主的立场已经成为亚非亿万人民的政策。这种立场既然具有这样大的力量，就必然对国际局势产生了影响。事实上，这种立场已经成为在全世界促使和平情绪普遍滋长的一个重要因素。这种立场已经取得了如此重要的地位，以致一切国家都非对它表明态度不可。
    大家知道，从社会制度来说，我们中国是一个社会主义国家，我们拥护和平、民主和社会主义。既然如此，也许我们对于独立自主立场这个问题的看法会使你们感到兴趣。
    让我直截了当地说明，由于我们相信，达到我们所向往的和平和正义的目标的道路不止一条，我们完全理解某些亚非国家的看法，他们觉得他们从不参加任何一方的立场上可以在这个斗争中发挥他们最大的作用，这里并没有矛盾。我们大家之所以都追求同样的目标，那是这些地区的历史条件所规定的逻辑发展。至于我们追求这种目标时所走的道路之所以不同，也是各个国家所特有的历史条件的逻辑发展。有一些共同的思想支配着我们东方人的全部生活，这里只列举其中的几种表现：一方面，我们坚持主张停止外来力量干涉我们的内部事务，另一方面，我们集中精力从事建设我们的国家的艰巨工作，而要进行建设，和平就是一个根本前提。我们共同的历史和共同的目标，使我们可以恰当地看待我们之间的分歧，从而把这些分歧缩小到恰如其分的程度，并且为了在不同制度的国家之间保持正常和有益的关系而在我们之间实行高度的合作。
    然而，有些地方却有人抨击某些亚洲国家所采取的独立自主的立场。他们说这是“过时的”、“不道德的”。他们声称这种立场不是遵循“不讨好任何一方”的路线的。他们推论说，如果一个国家保持这种立场，它就是“对别人的命运漠不关心”。在这些人士中间，对于这个概念的解释和要求，看来是有些混乱的。有些人认为如果要有中立的话，那么这种中立是没有实践的，而在行动上却对他们方面当然有利。但是现在让我们来看一看这种抨击和混乱的真正内容吧！令这些人士生气的是，连那些保持独立立场的人也公开表示，他们讨厌那些干涉其他地区和其他国家事务的危险的军事“公约狂”和“实力地位”政策。令这些人士不高兴的是，东方人民认为殖民主义是主要的危险，并且把帝国主义所策动的军事公约同殖民主义等量齐观。令这些人士不安的是，那些采取独立立场的人竟然同时积极地主张人人均应享有正义并且积极地维护和平。事实上，他们所抨击的，主要是这一点。
    我们中国对于某些亚非国家的独立自主的立场并没有什么混乱的看法，也不感到生气、不高兴或者不安。我们不抨击这种立场。我们极为赞赏这种立场，因为它有助于实现一切亚非人民的愿望，并且扩大了世界和平的可能性。我们认识到，尽管我们的社会制度各有不同，但是这不妨碍我们互相尊重别人的意愿，而且我们的关系可以是最友好和最合作的关系。
    我想，我们已经多次证明了这一点，特别在万隆会议以后。中国是首创五项原则的国家之一，自从制定了这些原则以来，我们一直信守这些原则。我们曾经积极努力来把五项原则的影响扩大到世界其他各地去。我们也支持亚非会议上所制定的十项原则。中国一贯努力于巩固已经建立的友好关系，并且在友好关系还不够或者还缺乏的地方努力为友好关系创造条件，而不问政治经济制度怎样不同，也不问国家是大是小，是近是远。我们已经大大扩大了我们的贸易和文化交流，并且努力争取进一步的扩大。最重要的是，我们一贯同情并且支持一切为民族自决和建设国家而奋斗的人民。中国人民就是这样同亚非全体人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起的。
    我想用不着我多说，刚才我所说的一切都直接表现在中国和印度尼西亚之间现存的良好关系上。不过请让我补充一句，这种关系是使中国人民感到极为高兴的一件事。我们希望我们可以更进一步改善并且加强我们同你们的联系，我们保证在这方面尽最大的努力。
    我们也希望同我们所有的亚非姊妹国家保有这种亲切的关系。因为我们坚信，我们的历史明确地教导了我们，只有加强我们之间的团结和合作，只有忠实地坚持万隆精神，我们大家才能在消除我们经济文化落后状态的历史性工作中得到进步并且互相帮助。同时，只有坚持这条进步的道路，我们才能在维护世界和平的重大斗争中充分发挥我们的作用。
    我们认识到万隆精神并不单单适用于亚非两洲。反之，它有助于在最广大的地区促进协商和和解、友好和合作的思想。在这方面，中国随时准备尽力来解决同某些国家的关系中的一些具体问题，中国同这些国家的关系到现在为止不能说是最好的。这特别适用于我们同美国的关系。一年多以前，我国周恩来总理在万隆声明，我们准备同美国政府的高级代表会晤，以便解决我们之间悬而未决的问题，从而为改善亚洲和太平洋地区的局势提供良好的气氛。中美两国大使在日内瓦的会谈曾使我们感到有些高兴，但是现在大家都很清楚，要得到根本的结果就得举行真正的高级会议。为了这个目的，我愿再一次提出中国人民和政府的这一建议，希望现在它会得到美国方面的适当响应。
    朋友们，由于亚非会议的召开和它所显示出来的世界三分之二人口的团结一致，你们的国家和你们的人民已经为创造历史建立了卓越的功绩。但是随着我们国家的前进，并且由于我们必须迎击殖民主义者破坏我们团结的新的进攻和阴谋，就需要我们每天创造新的历史。我们必须进一步努力，来扩大我们已经得到的伟大胜利，并且表明被压迫人民和国家的觉醒是能够扫清一切障碍并且继续获得更大胜利的一支力量。
    中国人民将永远在这个令人鼓舞的事业中同其他亚非人民站在一起。我们欢迎一切有助于促进这个事业的行动。阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理最近建议考虑在适当时机在符合国际气氛的条件下召开第二次亚非会议的可能性，我们欢迎这个建议。我们愿意尽一切可能来加强我们同亚非国家的友好合作，同他们团结起来为我们本国人民的幸福和繁荣、为亚洲、非洲和世界的和平而共同奋斗。
    愿亚非所有国家得到独立和自由！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平和国际合作万岁！
