An Encounter While Visiting

On the morning of August 17th, I rode my bicycle to the Ministry of Agriculture to discuss work. When I arrived at the entrance of the Ministry of Agriculture, I pushed my bicycle towards the parking area. Unexpectedly, the comrade in charge of watching the bicycles said, "We only park bicycles belonging to personnel of the Ministry; visitors cannot park here." I asked, "Where can visitors park?" He turned his head and said, "Over there!" I looked, and oh! There were three bicycle racks placed by the roadside to the west of the Ministry of Agriculture's gate, but no one was managing them.

I further asked, "Is anyone responsible for watching over the bicycles parked there?"

He rolled his eyes and said impatiently, "No one is responsible? Don't you see other people's bicycles are parked there too?"

Since other people's bicycles were parked there, I thought I had no reason to be special, and I couldn't find another parking area nearby, so I had to park my bicycle by the roadside as well.

However, to be honest, when I walked into the Ministry of Agriculture's office building to discuss work, I was still constantly worried about my bicycle parked by the roadside. If it really got stolen! I wouldn't be able to afford to pay for it even if I didn't eat for two months.

As far as I know, this phenomenon isn't unique to the Ministry of Agriculture. Could these organizations also consider visitors and provide some convenience? Guo Feng

    会客的遭遇
    八月十七日上午，我骑着车子去农业部接洽工作。走到农业部门口，就把车子推向存车处。不料那位负责看车的同志说：“这里只存本部人员的车子，客人的不能在这里存。”我说：“客人的存在哪里？”他把头一扭说：“存在那边！”我一看，呵！原来靠农业部大门西面的马路边放着三个车架子，却无人管理。
    我又问：“放在那里有没有人负责看管？”
    他把眼皮一翻不耐烦的说：“没人负责？你没看见别人的车子也都在那里放着吗？”
    既然别人的车子都在那里放着，我想自己也没有理由特殊，附近又找不到另外的存车处，我只好把车子也放在马路边。
    不过，说实在的，当我走进农业部办公大楼接谈工作的时候，心里还老在惦记着那辆在马路边放着的车子。假若真的丢了呀！我可得两个月不吃饭也赔不起。
    据我所知，这现象还不止农业部一个部门如此。这些机关能不能也为客人打算一下，给点方便呢？　　果风
