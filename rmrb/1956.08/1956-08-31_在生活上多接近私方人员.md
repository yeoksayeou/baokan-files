On a holiday, the Youth League of a certain professional company in a certain city organized a picnic and played a game of "find the note and win a prize." A public shareholder representative participated with his child. They searched all over the mountains and fields but couldn't find a single note, while a private shareholder representative found two right away. The private shareholder representative, seeing that the public shareholder representative's child hadn't found any notes, enthusiastically offered to give the child one. The public shareholder representative refused to let the child accept it. The child, not understanding the "inside story," innocently reached out and clamored for it. The public shareholder representative had no choice but to accept. However, he couldn't shake it off in his heart, feeling that it was a matter of "stance" and that he shouldn't have accepted it.

If things are like this even in a game, then in daily work, of course, everyone is even more careful, keeping the boundaries clear.

It is said that similar things have happened in other joint public-private enterprises. For example, some people are afraid to talk to private sector personnel individually, and some are afraid to go out with private sector personnel.

Public representatives in joint public-private enterprises have a responsibility to unite, educate, and transform private sector personnel. Doing a good job in public-private cooperation is for the sake of uniting and educating private sector personnel, striving for their early transformation into self-reliant laborers.

If the public and private sectors draw a clear line between each other everywhere, and even fear losing their "stance" by giving away a note in a game, the result will inevitably be to deepen the estrangement between them, which is detrimental and harmful to the country's socialist transformation.

Standing firm does not mean avoiding contact with private sector personnel. Only by getting closer to private sector personnel in life can we better understand their ideological situation, so that we can unite and educate them through various means. This is the attitude that a person who truly stands firm on the working class's stance should have.

    在生活上多接近私方人员
    耿荆山
    一个放假的日子，某市某专业公司青年团组织野游，玩“找纸条得奖”的游戏。有一个公方股长带着他的小孩一起参加。他们找遍山野，没有找到一张纸条；而另一个私方股长却一下找到了两张。私方股长看见公方股长的小孩没有找到纸条，热情地要送给小孩一张。公方股长无论如何不许小孩要。小孩却不懂得“内情”，天真地伸手嚷着要，公方股长无可奈何，只好接受了。但他心中始终放不下去，觉得这是有关“立场”的问题，认为不该接收。
    游戏尚且如此，日常工作相处当然更是处处留心，界线分明了。
    据说这样的事情，在其他公私合营企业中也发生过这种现象。比如有人怕和私方人员个别谈话，有人怕和私方人员一起游玩。
    公私合营企业中的公股代表有责任团结、教育和改造私方人员。搞好公私共事关系，是为了团结和教育私方人员，争取他们早日改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    如果公私双方处处划上一道鸿沟，甚至在游戏中连送一张纸条都怕有失“立场”，其结果必然是加深彼此之间的隔阂，对国家的社会主义改造事业无益而有害。
    站稳立场，不等于避免和私方人员接触。只有在生活中多接近私方人员，才能更多地了解他们的思想情况，以便通过各种方式对他们进行团结和教育，这才是真正站稳工人阶级立场的人所应该具有的态度。
