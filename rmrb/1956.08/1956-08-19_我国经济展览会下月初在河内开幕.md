Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 18th. The Chinese Economic Exhibition is scheduled to open in Hanoi in early September. The construction of the exhibition hall is nearing completion, and almost all of the more than 3,000 exhibits have been transported, including heavy industrial products, light industrial products, handicrafts, agricultural products, native products, and specialty products.

    This exhibition hall, the largest in Hanoi's history, is located near the Hanoi Railway Station. It was built by Vietnamese workers with a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In the hot and rainy season, the workers not only did not stop working for a single day, but also overfulfilled their tasks and saved thousands of workdays. The labor enthusiasm shown by Vietnamese workers in building the hall vividly reflects the profound friendship between the people of Vietnam and China.

    At present, the installation and arrangement work inside the exhibition hall is being stepped up, and all the work will be completed soon.

    我国经济展览会下月初在河内开幕
    新华社河内18日电　中国经济展览会定九月初在河内开幕。展览馆的建筑工程已经接近完成，三千多种展品差不多已经全部运到，其中包括重工业品、轻工业品、手工艺品、农产品、土产和特产等。
    这个河内历史上规模最大的展览馆位于河内火车站附近，它是在越南工人兄弟高度的劳动热情下赶建出来的。在炎热而多雨的季节里，工人们不但没有停止过一天的工作，而且超额完成了任务和节省了成千个工作日。越南工人在建馆中表现的劳动热情，生动地反映了越中两国人民深厚的友谊。
    目前，展览馆内部的安装和布置工作正在加紧进行，全部工作不久即将完成。
