    People and Shoes
    Qin Mu
    The relationship between people and shoes is that people make shoes and people wear shoes; it is definitely not shoes making people, or shoes "wearing people."
    People make shoes and wear them in order to walk better. Therefore, shoes are required to fit well. Naturally, "five babies in one bed" means that once you wear shoes, your feet and toes will inevitably be constrained, but this constraint should never turn your toes into sardines in a can, leaving them no room to stretch. If the shoes are too tight, they can be modified or the laces loosened. If sand gets in, you should also take off your shoes to clean them out. These are all things below common sense, and saying any more would make people suspect the author has gone mad.
    However, in real life, some people completely ignore these principles, wearing tight shoes, like women with bound feet in ancient times wearing arch shoes, wobbling as they walk, yet praising themselves for "obeying the rules."
    Many of the systems, methods, and regulations for work are very much like shoes, intended to help us do our work better. But just as shoes sometimes don't fit very well and must be padded or the laces loosened, these things are not completely inflexible. However, in real life, there are quite a few people who, as human beings, obey these systems, methods, and regulations as if they were matter obeying the laws of physics and chemistry.
    There have been similar incidents like this:
    In some places, in order to encourage farmers to raise pigs to a larger size before selling them, it is stipulated that the specifications for pigs purchased by the purchasing station are 120 jin (60 kg). Some farmers bring their pigs, and the staff at the purchasing station use sticks to drive the pigs around the yard, letting the pigs relieve themselves before weighing them. Upon weighing, it is exactly 119 and a half jin (59.75 kg). So, they say "does not meet specifications" and tell the farmers to take the pigs back. The pigs are taken back! But the people selling the pigs are truly "full of grievances."
    Hospitals have a set of procedures where patients must register and pay fees before being admitted. These procedures should naturally be followed under normal circumstances. But in many places, things like this have also happened, where patients in extremely urgent situations are carried into the hospital, and the hospital staff insist on completing all the formalities slowly before allowing them to see a doctor, resulting in deaths due to lack of medical attention.
    Things like these make one wonder whether these people want to wear shoes to walk properly, or whether they want to use a pair of arch shoes to trap their feet, making it impossible to move an inch?
    As for those who rigidly enforce regulations and disregard the lives of others, can you really say that they have a good sense of organization and discipline? I don't think so. They often use "systems" and "regulations" as a cover to hide their indifference and heartlessness towards people, and to cover up the festering sore of their weak sense of responsibility towards the people's cause.
    All the regulations and methods of all our undertakings and all our departments must be subordinate to socialist construction and improving the people's happy life. All minor principles must be subordinate to this major principle. When minor principles and major principles conflict in special circumstances, should we firmly adhere to the major principle and major principles, or should we cling to a minor principle and forget the major principle and major principles completely? It is often on this point that one can see the true strength of a person's principles.

    人和鞋子
    秦牧
    人和鞋子的关系，是人制造鞋子，人穿鞋子；决不是鞋子制造人，鞋子“穿人”。
    人是为了更好地走路才制造鞋子和穿上鞋子的。因此，要求鞋子能够合脚。自然，“五个宝宝一张床”，既要穿鞋子了，脚板，脚趾免不了要受约束，但这约束决不是要把脚趾变成罐头里的沙丁鱼，不让它有任何伸缩的余地。鞋子紧了，可以改造，可以放松鞋带。砂子溜进来了，还应该除下鞋子来清理清理。这些，都是常识以下的事情，再说下去就会有人怀疑作者发了神经病了。
    然而在实际生活里，却竟然有人完全不睬这些道理，他们穿着紧鞋子，像古代的缠脚妇女穿弓鞋一样，弄得走路摇摇摆摆，却自许为“遵守制度”。
    许多工作的制度、办法、规章，作用本来和鞋子很相像，是为了帮助我们工作做得更好。但正像鞋子有时会不很合脚，必须垫一块皮或者放松鞋带一样，这些东西并不是完全不许可有灵活性的。可是，现实生活里却竟然有不少人以人的身分，却像物质遵守物理和化学的定律一样，来遵守这些制度、办法、规章。
    有过类似这样的一些事情：
    有些地方为了使农民把猪养得大一点才出卖，规定收购站收购生猪的规格是120斤。有的农民把猪抬来了，收购站的人员就用棍子把猪赶得在院子里团团转，让猪拉过了屎尿之后才来过秤。一秤，不多不少是119斤半。于是，说一声“不合规格”，就要农民把猪抬回去。猪是被抬回去了！然而卖猪的人却真个是“怨声载道”了。
    医院有它的一套病人必须登记、缴费才得入院的办法。这些办法在通常的情形下自然是应该遵守的。但好些地方也发生过这样的事情，情况异常紧急的病人抬进院来，医院人员一定要慢吞吞地办完一切手续才准见医生，结果就发生了失医致死的事情。
    像这一类事情，都使人想起，究竟这些人是想穿着鞋子好好走路呢，还是想用一对弓鞋套住自己的脚，使自己寸步难移？
    像这些死板地执行规章，不理别人死活的人，你说他们真的是组织性纪律性很好么？我看也不见得。他们往往是用“制度”“规章”做幌子，来遮盖自己对人的冷淡无情，遮盖自己对人民事业责任心薄弱的烂疮罢了。
    我们一切事业的一切部门，一切规章和一切办法，都要服从于社会主义建设和增进人民的幸福生活，一切小道理都要服从这个大道理，当小道理和大道理在特殊情形下发生冲突的时候，紧紧遵守大道理大原则呢，还是抓住一点小道理，把大道理大原则忘个干净？常常在这一点上，可以看出一个人真正原则性的强弱。
