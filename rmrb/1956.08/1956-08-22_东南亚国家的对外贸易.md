    Foreign Trade of Southeast Asian Countries
    Xiao Deqi
    A characteristic of the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries is that the value of foreign trade accounts for a very large proportion of national income, trade items are concentrated in a few commodities, and trade partners are concentrated in a few countries. For example, the value of foreign trade in Malaya generally accounts for 50%-60% of national income, Ceylon accounts for more than 30%, Burma accounts for 25%-30%, Thailand accounts for 20%, and the Philippines accounts for about 10%. This means that the economic life of these countries is often affected by foreign trade.
    Many important resources in Southeast Asia occupy an important position in the world, such as natural rubber production accounting for more than 95% of the capitalist world, tin accounting for more than 50%, cinchona, hemp, teak, and pepper accounting for more than 90%, coconut 75%, palm oil 50%, cane sugar 14%, and tea 18%. Some of these products are produced entirely for foreign markets, and most of them are exported abroad. For example, most of the cultivated land in Malaya is used to produce rubber for export, so that grain production cannot meet one-third of the national needs. In 1955, the export value of rubber in Malaya accounted for 54% of the total export value. In the same year, the export value of tin in Malaya accounted for 12% of the total export volume. In other words, rubber and tin account for 66% of Malaya's total export value and are the lifeline of Malaya's national economy.
    Indonesia's rubber production ranks first in the capitalist world, tin ranks second, and there are also iron ore and oil. These products are almost entirely supplied for export. In 1955, rubber and oil alone accounted for 46% of the total export value.
    All the rubber produced in Burma, 30% of the rice, and more than 50% of the cotton and beans are supplied for export. In 1954, rice and rubber accounted for 83% of the total export value. In 1955, the export value of tea, rubber, and coconut products in Ceylon accounted for 91% of its total export value, rice and rubber in Thailand accounted for 74%, and sugar and coconut in the Philippines accounted for 64%. Therefore, if the prices of these commodities fluctuate, it will inevitably affect the foreign exchange changes of these countries and threaten their national income.
    Imperialist countries occupy a monopoly position in the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries. For example, about 80% of the total export value of the Philippines is exported to the United States, and more than 70% of the total import value comes from the United States. In Indonesia's export trade, the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Singapore account for about 60%.
    This situation has brought endless disasters to Southeast Asian countries. Especially since the implementation of the "embargo," imperialist countries have, on the one hand, prohibited them from exporting so-called strategic materials to socialist countries, and on the other hand, used methods such as reducing purchases or stopping purchases to lower prices, making their trade deficits larger, gold reserves reduced, fiscal deficits increased, inflation, and unemployment increased. Compared with 1951 and 1954, due to the price fluctuations of these products, Indonesia's export value decreased from 1,292 million US dollars to 865 million US dollars; Thailand decreased from 367 million US dollars to 283 million US dollars. On the other hand, the imports of Southeast Asian countries are all necessities of life, and it is very difficult to make any adjustments in prices. They have to spend a lot of money every year to import grain, food, and necessities of life. Import prices cannot be reduced to offset the decline in export product prices, so countries can only reduce foreign exchange reserves. For example, Burma's foreign exchange reserves were 211 million US dollars at the end of 1953, and decreased to 92 million US dollars at the end of 1955. Indonesia was 511 million US dollars at the end of 1951, and decreased to 212 million US dollars at the end of 1953. The Philippines was 400 million US dollars at the end of 1948, and decreased to 191 million US dollars in October 1955. Thailand was 359 million US dollars at the end of 1951, and decreased to 273 million US dollars at the end of 1954.
    These countries also have to reduce the import of machinery and equipment. For example, compared with 1952 and 1955, Indonesia decreased from 174.42 million US dollars to 112.21 million US dollars, and Malaya decreased from 167 million US dollars to 124 million US dollars. These restrictions have weakened their domestic construction, while inflation and fiscal deficits continue to plague them, sometimes reaching dangerous levels. From 1951 to 1955, currency in circulation increased by 1.5 times in Indonesia, 88% in Burma, 36% in Malaya, and 43% in Thailand. Inflation has caused a sharp rise in the price of imported goods, further worsening the trade trend.
    The disaster brought about by the "embargo" is prominently manifested in the rubber trade. In 1951, Indonesia exported 806,000 tons of rubber, earning 653 million US dollars in foreign exchange; in 1954, it exported 740,000 tons of rubber, worth 264 million US dollars, that is, a decrease of nearly 10% in quantity and a decrease of 60% in value. In terms of price, the average price of Indonesian exported rubber per ton in 1951 was 810 US dollars, while in 1954 it was 357 US dollars, that is, in 1954, Indonesia lost 453 US dollars for every ton of rubber exported, and the loss in rubber exports alone was 325 million US dollars throughout the year, which is about one-third of Indonesia's total export value for the whole year.
    The "embargo" caused Malaya's foreign trade to decline sharply. In 1950, Malaya's foreign trade surplus was 1,099 million ringgits, and in 1951 the surplus was 1,318 million ringgits. Since 1952, it began to have a deficit. In 1953, the deficit was 218 million ringgits, and in 1954 the deficit was 30 million ringgits. In 1950, Malaya exported 780,000 tons of rubber, and in 1954 it was 610,000 tons, a decrease of 170,000 tons; in terms of price, the rubber price in March 1954 was one-fifth of the highest price in 1951. The export value in 1954 decreased by 49% compared with 1951. This is the result of the United States' "embargo" on the one hand and reducing imports to lower prices on the other hand. In 1954, the United States purchased less than half of Malaya's rubber in 1951, which forced the living standards of planters in 500,000 small and medium-sized rubber plantations in Malaya to be reduced by more than half.
    On the rice issue, Southeast Asian countries have been affected by the dumping of US agricultural products. Before the war, from 1934 to 1938, the average annual rice export of Southeast Asian countries was 8.9 million tons, and the US rice export during the same period was only 68,000 tons; by 1952, Southeast Asian countries decreased to 5 million tons, while the United States increased to 790,000 tons. In 1954, Thailand's rice exports decreased by 32% compared with 1950, and Burma also decreased a lot compared with before the war. Since the second half of 1953, rice has been piled up, leading to spoilage and price declines, which has affected the sharp decline in foreign exchange income. In 1956, Thailand's initial rice inventory was 80,000 tons, and Burma's was 600,000 tons, while the United States stepped up dumping to compete for the market. Brazil, the traditional market for Thai rice, has been occupied by US rice. At the beginning of March this year, the United States sold 165,000 tons of rice to Pakistan in the name of "relief," and at the same time sold 250,000 tons to Indonesia in the form of loans. Recently, the United States has also negotiated with Japan to dump 250,000 tons of surplus rice paid in Japanese yen. The Burmese "Nation" pointed out that the US dumping of rice to Pakistan has taken away a traditional market for Burmese rice. In 1955-56, the United States is preparing to export 770,000 tons of new rice, plus an inventory of 790,000 tons, it will export 1.56 million tons, which will further threaten the output of rice in Southeast Asian countries.
    Southeast Asian countries are adjacent to China and have traditional trade relations, but due to the interference and control of imperialism, trade exchanges have been hindered. For example, in 1948, the trade between the Philippines and China was 25 million US dollars, while in recent years the total has been only 2 million US dollars. This situation is obviously unfavorable to the economic life of Southeast Asian countries.
    What is the way out for the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries? We can see from the official remarks and business opinions of Thailand and the Philippines. Recently, the Thai Minister of Finance told the press that Thai business circles no longer need to worry and should boldly trade with China. The "Thai People's Daily" editorial said that it is self-imprisonment to prohibit trade with a country with a population of 600 million - Thailand's old customers in Asia; and said that trade with China will improve the already withered Thai market. The chairman of the New Traders and Producers Association of the Philippines said on June 16 that establishing trade relations with socialist countries would mean an increase in trade volume and an increase in employment opportunities for the Philippines' two million unemployed. He pointed out that relying on trade with the United States puts Philippine business in an annoying dilemma. There are also more and more people in the Philippine Congress who advocate developing trade relations with socialist countries.
    On June 4, the Ministers of Industry and Commerce of Singapore and Malaya jointly announced the lifting of the rubber "embargo" and allowed exports to China. The next day, Thailand said it would follow suit. Indonesia, the largest rubber producer, also lifted the ban. So far, the rubber "embargo," which has been in place for nearly six years, has been further broken. Rubber is the main source of national income for Malaya and Indonesia, and it is also the main source of tax revenue for their governments. Within two hours of the announcement of the lifting of the "embargo," the price of No. 1 rubber in the Singapore market rose by four ringgits per pound. The chairman of the Singapore Rubber Workers' Union said that the lifting of the ban on rubber exports to China has brought bright prospects for the rubber industry, and local tax revenue can increase by more than 200 million ringgits per year.
    The United States is the largest consumer of rubber, but from January to May this year, US automobile production decreased by 25% compared with the same period last year, and its demand for rubber will decrease. The United States produced 900,000 tons of synthetic rubber last year, and this year it will increase to about 1.14 million tons. US President Eisenhower said that the United States will produce 1.7 million tons of synthetic rubber in 1958. It can be seen that countries that produce natural rubber have no other way out than to break all taboos and actively develop and strengthen trade exchanges with all countries.
    The resolutions of the Asian-African Conference greatly promoted economic cooperation between countries. After this conference, foreign trade between Asian and African countries has developed greatly. For example, Burma's trade volume with Eastern European People's Democratic countries was only 1 million US dollars in 1953, while it increased to 7 million US dollars in 1955; trade with China was 3 million US dollars in 1953, while it increased to 27 million US dollars in 1955. During the same period, Indonesia's trade with China increased from 6,700 US dollars to 15.15 million US dollars, and trade with Eastern European People's Democratic countries increased from 10 million US dollars to 60 million US dollars. Recently, Indonesia has signed a new trade agreement with Czechoslovakia, with a trade volume of 6 million pounds for each party.
    In April this year, the Soviet Union and Burma signed a supplementary trade agreement, under which Burma will supply the Soviet Union with 400,000 tons of rice annually for four years, accounting for about one-quarter of Burma's total rice exports. Romania has also recently bought 20,000 tons of rice from Burma. Ceylon has also established trade relations with Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania and other countries.
    Now, the call for Southeast Asian countries to carry out trade with socialist countries is becoming more and more common. The economic development plans of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries have opened up new prospects for the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries. We are willing to further develop trade relations with these countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, in order to seek common economic prosperity for all countries.

    东南亚国家的对外贸易
    萧德义
    东南亚各国对外贸易的特征是，对外贸易价值在国民收入中所占比重极大，而贸易项目集中于少数商品，贸易对象又集中于少数国家。例如，马来亚对外贸易价值一般占国民收入的50％—60％，锡兰占30％以上，缅甸占25％—30％，泰国占20％，菲律宾约占10％。这意味着这些国家的经济生活不能不经常受着对外贸易的影响。
    东南亚地区的许多重要资源在世界上占着重要地位，如天然橡胶产量占资本主义世界95％以上，锡占50％以上，金鸡纳、大麻、柚木、胡椒各占90％以上，椰子75％，棕油50％，蔗糖14％，茶叶18％。这些产品有的全部为国外市场而生产，有的绝大部分输往国外。例如，马来亚全国大部耕地面积用于生产供出口的橡胶，以致粮食产量不能满足全国需要的三分之一。1955年马来亚橡胶出口值占出口总值的54％。同年马来亚锡出口值占出口总量的12％。换句话说，橡胶和锡占马来亚出口总值的66％，是马来亚国民经济的生命线。
    印度尼西亚橡胶产量占资本主义世界第一位，锡占第二位，还有铁矿和石油，这几种产品几乎全部供应出口。1955年仅橡胶和石油就占出口总值的46％。
    缅甸所产全部橡胶，30％的大米，50％以上的棉花和豆类都供应出口。1954年米和橡胶两项占出口总值的83％。1955年锡兰茶叶、橡胶和椰子产品出口值占它的出口总值的91％，泰国的米和橡胶占74％，菲律宾的糖和椰子占64％。因此，这些商品的价格如果发生波动，就不能不影响这些国家的外汇变动，并威胁它们的国民收入。
    帝国主义国家在东南亚国家对外贸易中占有垄断地位。例如菲律宾出口总值中约近80％输往美国，进口总值中有70％以上来自美国。印度尼西亚的出口贸易中，美国、荷兰、英国和新加坡约占60％。
    这种情形给东南亚国家带来无穷的灾难。尤其从实行“禁运”以后，帝国主义国家一方面禁止它们把所谓战略物资输往社会主义阵营各国，一方面又利用减少收购或停止收购的手段以压低价格，使得它们的贸易逆差加大，黄金储备减少，财政赤字增大，通货膨胀，失业增加。1951年和1954年比较，由于这些产品的价格波动，使印度尼西亚的出口价值由129，200万美元减为86，500万美元；泰国由36，700万美元减为28，300万美元。另一方面，东南亚各国进口的都是生活必需品，要想在价格上作任何调整都非常困难，它们每年要花一大笔钱来输入粮食、食品和生活必需品。进口价格不能减低以抵销出口产品价格的下降，因此各国只有减少外汇储备。例如，缅甸的外汇储备1953年底为21，100万美元，1955年底减为9，200万美元。印度尼西亚1951年底为51，100万美元，1953年底减为21，200万美元。菲律宾1948年底为四亿美元， 1955年10月减为19，100万美元。泰国1951年底为35，900万美元，1954年底减为27，300万美元。
    这些国家还不得不减少机器设备的进口。例如，1952年和1955年比较，印度尼西亚从17，442万美元减为11，221万美元，马来亚从16，700万美元减为12，400万美元。这些限制削弱了它们的国内建设，同时通货膨胀和财政赤字也继续在袭击它们，有时达到危险程度。从1951年到1955年，通货在印度尼西亚增加1.5倍，缅甸增加88％，马来亚36％，泰国43％。通货膨胀使进口货猛烈上涨，使贸易趋势进一步恶化。
    “禁运”带来的灾难，突出地表现在橡胶贸易上。1951年印度尼西亚出口橡胶80.6万吨，收入外汇65，300万美元；1954年出口橡胶七十四万吨，价值26，400万美元，也就是在数量上减少近10％，在价值上减少60％。拿价格来计算，1951年印度尼西亚出口橡胶每吨平均价格为810美元，而1954年为357美元，也就是1954年印度尼西亚每出口一吨橡胶要损失453美元，全年仅在橡胶出口上就损失三亿二千五百万美元，这个数字约等于印度尼西亚全年出口总值的三分之一。
    “禁运”使马来亚对外贸易直线下降。1950年马来亚对外贸易出超109，900万叻元，1951年出超131，800万叻元，自1952年以后开始入超，1953年入超21，800万叻元，1954年入超三千万叻元。1950年马来亚出口橡胶七十八万吨，1954年为六十一万吨，减少十七万吨；在价格上，1954年3月的橡胶价格为1951年最高价格五分之一。1954年出口值比1951年减少49％。这是美国一面“禁运”一面减少进口以压低价格的结果。1954年美国购买马来亚橡胶不及1951年的一半，这迫使马来亚五十万中小橡胶园的种植者的生活水平降低一半以上。
    在大米问题上，东南亚国家受到了美国农产品倾销的影响。战前1934—38年东南亚国家大米出口平均每年八百九十万吨，同期美国大米出口只有六万八千吨；到1952年东南亚国家减为五百万吨，而美国增为七十九万吨。1954年泰国大米出口比1950年减少32％，而缅甸也比战前减少很多，自1953年下半年起，大米堆积，以致腐坏，价格下跌，影响外汇收入急剧下降。1956年泰国大米初期库存为八万吨，缅甸为六十万吨，美国却加紧倾销，争夺市场。作为泰国大米传统市场的巴西已被美国大米所侵占。今年三月初，美国以“救济”名义向巴基斯坦销售大米十六万五千吨，同时向印度尼西亚以贷款方式销售二十五万吨，最近美国又同日本谈判按日元支付倾销剩余大米二十五万吨。缅甸“民族报”指出：美国对巴基斯坦倾销大米是夺去了缅甸大米的一个传统市场。1955—56年度，美国准备出口新米七十七万吨，再加上库存七十九万吨，它将要出口156万吨，这将使东南亚国家大米的输出遭到进一步的威胁。
    东南亚国家与中国毗邻，有传统的贸易关系，但由于帝国主义的干涉和控制，贸易来往受到阻挠。例如，1948年菲律宾与中国贸易为2，500万美元，而近几年来合计只有二百万美元。这种情况对于东南亚国家的经济生活显然是不利的。
    东南亚国家对外贸易的出路何在呢？我们看一下泰国和菲律宾的官方言论和商业界意见就可以说明。最近，泰国财政部长向报界发表谈话，要求泰国商业界不必再有顾虑，大胆地同中国贸易。“泰人报”社论说，禁止同有六亿人口的国家——泰国在亚洲的老主顾——进行贸易是自我禁锢；并说，同中国贸易将使已经枯萎的泰国市场好转起来。菲律宾新贸易商和生产者商会会长于六月十六日发表谈话说，同社会主义阵营国家建立贸易关系，将意味着贸易量的增加和菲律宾二百万失业者就业机会的增加，他指出依赖美国的贸易，使菲律宾商务处于令人烦恼的进退两难的局面。菲律宾国会中主张发展与社会主义阵营贸易关系的人也越来越多了。
    六月四日，新加坡与马来亚的工商部长一同宣布解除橡胶“禁运”，准许输往中国。第二天泰国表示要照办。出产橡胶最多的印度尼西亚紧接着也解除了禁令。至此，实行了将近六年的橡胶“禁运”，已经进一步打破了。橡胶是马来亚和印度尼西亚国民收入的主要泉源，也是它们政府税收的主要来源。在宣布解除“禁运”后两小时内，新加坡市场一号胶价每磅直升四叻仙。新加坡橡胶工会主席说，橡胶输往中国禁令解除，胶业前途获得光明，而当地税收每年可增加二亿元以上。
    美国是橡胶的最大消费者，而今年一至五月份美国汽车生产比去年同期减少25％，它对橡胶的需求将会减少。美国去年人造胶生产九十万吨，今年将提高约为114万吨。美国总统艾森豪威尔说，美国1958年将产人造胶一百七十万吨。由此可见，生产天然橡胶的国家除了打破一切戒律，积极开展和加强同各国之间的贸易来往，是不能有别的出路的。
    亚非会议的决议大大推动了各国之间的经济合作。在这个会议以后，亚非国家之间的对外贸易有了很大的发展。例如，缅甸1953年与东欧人民民主国家贸易额仅一百万美元，而1955年增为七百万美元；与中国贸易1953年为三百万美元，而1955年增为2，700万美元。同期印度尼西亚与中国贸易从6，700美元增为1，515万美元，与东欧人民民主国家贸易从一千万美元增为六千万美元。最近印度尼西亚又与捷克斯洛伐克签订新的贸易协定，各方贸易额为六百万英镑。
    今年四月，苏联与缅甸签订了补充贸易协定，缅甸在四年内每年将供应苏联大米四十万吨，约占缅甸大米出口总量的四分之一。罗马尼亚最近也向缅甸买米二万吨。锡兰与捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚等国也建立了贸易关系。
    现在，东南亚国家要求与社会主义阵营国家开展贸易的呼声愈来愈普遍。苏联、中国和人民民主国家的经济发展计划，为东南亚国家的对外贸易展开了新的远景，我们愿意在平等互利的基础上同这些国家进一步发展贸易关系，以谋求各国经济的共同繁荣。
