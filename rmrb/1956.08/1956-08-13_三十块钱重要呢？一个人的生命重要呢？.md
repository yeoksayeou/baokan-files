It's hard to believe that in our society, which acknowledges that people are the most valuable of all assets, thirty yuan could be considered more important than a person's life, more important than the life of a soldier who once defended the motherland. But this is exactly what happened at the Hui County Hygiene Hospital in Henan: Zhang Jinfu, a demobilized construction soldier and a Communist Party member, died tragically because he didn't have thirty yuan and couldn't get timely treatment.

In January of this year, Zhang Jinfu fell seriously ill. After being diagnosed by a doctor at the local Yimin Clinic, he was told he needed to be sent to a hospital for treatment immediately. The next morning, Zhang Jinfu was sent to the Hui County Hygiene Hospital. After the doctors at the Hui County Hygiene Hospital made a diagnosis, they decided to admit the patient for treatment. When Zhang Jinfu's second brother, Zhang Jinan, who had brought him, went to complete the admission procedures, he was refused by accountant Huo Yunming because he only had five yuan on him. Zhang Jinan ran to get his wife's (who came with him to admit Zhang Jinfu) only two yuan, but he was refused again by accountant Xu Qi'an. Xu Qi'an said, "Patients must pay at least 20 yuan for medicine and 10 yuan for food before being admitted! Without the money, you can't be admitted!" Zhang Jinan pleaded repeatedly to have the patient admitted first, and he would go back and sell some things to pay the money, but he was still refused permission. Later, although the Hui County Civil Affairs Department agreed to let the patient be admitted for treatment first, the hospital's director, Director Li, still insisted on completing the formalities first. Just because he was short a little money, Zhang Jinfu, who had a fever of over 40 degrees, was left to the side.

It's also hard to believe that a hospital that claims to serve the people would take a "see and don't save" attitude when seeing a patient with a serious illness. But the Hui County Hygiene Hospital was like that. Zhang Jinfu clearly registered for emergency treatment at the Hui County Hygiene Hospital, but the outpatient doctor, Niu Peiji, ignored this and continued to diagnose ordinary patients. He only gave Zhang Jinfu a diagnosis after seeing three ordinary patients. By this time, Zhang Jinfu was already in a coma, with a temperature of 40.7°C. When examining his blood, it was only possible to squeeze out a little blood from his ear because the patient's blood concentration was too high. This situation indicated that the illness was very serious, and the hospital should have taken emergency measures to treat him. However, doctors Niu and Zhao (Tingming) only diagnosed him, prescribed two Bai'erding injections and three packets of Aspirin. Zhang Jinan took the prescription to get the medicine and spent a long time finding someone to get the medicine. After getting the medicine, he wasted more time looking for someone to give the injection. By this time, it was already 1:30 PM, and the patient's temperature had risen again. Only then did the hospital convene doctors Niu, Zhao, and six other doctors and the treatment section chief for a consultation. After the consultation, they decided to admit the patient. During the admission procedures, the outpatient doctors thought that since the patient had been admitted, the outpatient department could ignore him. The ward doctors thought that since the patient had not yet entered the ward, they could ignore him. No one took care of the patient. It was not until after 4:00 PM that the patient finally entered a temporary ward, sleeping on a bare mat. It was still winter at that time, and there was no fire in the room, so it was very cold. The patient's family asked a nurse to get some coal to start a fire, but the nurse said, "Go home and get your own coal!" As a result, no fire was started. Finally, the patient entered the ward. After a spinal fluid test, the doctors suspected encephalitis and prescribed one penicillin injection and one camphor cardiazol injection. The patient's family searched everywhere for someone to get the medicine, but by the time they finally got it, the patient was already dead.

In their eyes, it seemed that money was more important than life. Money being more important than life is a capitalist business idea, which has nothing to do with our hospitals that serve the people. Although people's hospitals also charge fees for registration, medicine, and food, this is not for profit, but to enable medical institutions to continue working and treat more people. The purpose of people's hospitals is to serve the people, and rescuing patients in critical condition is an undeniable responsibility of medical institutions. Director Li and others at the Hui County Hospital completely forgot this principle and put money first.

After Zhang Jinfu died, when the county and district investigated the matter, the Hui County Hygiene Hospital tried to shirk its responsibility and made two false reports. They changed the patient's registration time to 11:55 AM, said that they had injected the patient with penicillin and camphor cardiazol, and given the patient the necessary treatment. They claimed that the patient's death had nothing to do with the hospital, cleared themselves of responsibility, and deceived their superiors. When the relevant provincial authorities investigated the matter, they continued to insist on their mistakes and passively resisted. This matter has not yet been completely resolved.

    三十块钱重要呢？一个人的生命重要呢？
    高之波　韩大正
    你很难相信，在我们这个承认人是一切财富中最宝贵的财富的社会里，三十块钱会比一个人的生命更重要，会比一个曾经保卫过祖国的战士的生命更重要，但是在河南辉县卫生院就发生了这样的事情：复员建设军人、共产党员张金富就因为没有三十块钱，得不到及时的治疗，而惨痛地死去了。
    今年一月间，张金富得了急病，经过当地益民诊所医生的诊断急需送医院治疗，第二天早晨，张金富被送到辉县卫生院。辉县卫生院的医生诊断以后，决定病人入院治疗。当送病人来的张金富的二哥张金安去办理住院手续的时候，因为身上只带有五块钱，就遭到了会计霍运明的拒绝。张金安跑去把他妻子（一起送张金富入院来的）身上仅有的两块钱也拿了来，可是又遭到会计徐启安的拒绝。徐启安说：“病人入院最少要先交药费二十元，伙食费十元，没有钱入不了院！”张金安再三哀求先让病人住院，他回去卖了东西再来交钱，还是得不到许可。以后，虽然由辉县民政科同意病人先入院治疗，但是卫生院的李院长仍然坚持要先办理好手续。就因为短少一点钱，发着四十度以上高烧的张金富被丢在一边。
    你也很难相信，会有一个自称为人民服务的医院，在看到一个有急病的病人时，采取见死不救的态度。可是辉县卫生院就是这样的。张金富在辉县卫生院明明挂的是急诊号，可是门诊医生牛培基却不管这个，继续诊断普通病人，直到看完了三个普通病人的病之后，才给张金富诊断。这时，张金富已经昏迷，体温达到40.7℃。检查血液的时候，因为病人血液浓度增大，只能勉强在耳部挤出一点血来。这种情况说明病情已经非常严重，医院应该采取紧急措施治疗，可是仅由牛、赵（廷明）二医生诊断了一下，开了两只白尔定和三包阿斯匹灵。张金安拿着处方去取药，找了好久，才找到人取到药。取了药后找打针的人，又耽误了一些时间。这时已是下午一点半钟，病人体温又有增高，这才由院方召集牛、赵等六位医生和治疗股长会诊。会诊以后，决定病人住院。在办理入院手续期间，门诊医生认为病人决定住院了，门诊方面可以不管，病房医生又认为病人还没有进入病房，病房医生可以不管。谁也不去照顾一下病人。到下午四点多钟，病人好容易进了临时病房，睡在一个光席上。那时还是冬天，屋里没生火，冷得很。病人家属请求一位护士弄点煤生火，那护士却说：“回你家取煤去！”结果火没有生成。最后病人入了病房，经过刺穿脊髓液化验，医生的印象是脑炎，开了盘尼西林一只、康福那心一只的处方，病人的家属拿着处方又到处找不到取药人，好容易把药取来，可是病人已经死去。
    在他们看来，好像钱重于生命。钱重于生命，这是资本主义经营思想，这同我们为人民服务的医院毫不相干。人民的医院虽然也要收挂号、药品和住院伙食等费用，但这却不是为了谋利，而是为了使医疗机构能够继续工作下去，为更多的人治疗疾病。人民医院的工作目的就是为人民服务，而抢救病人于危急之中，更是医疗机构不可推卸的责任。辉县的李院长等人完全忘掉了这个原则，而把钱放在了第一位。
    张金富死后，县、专区追查这件事情的时候，辉县卫生院企图推卸自己的责任，作了两次假报告。他们把病人挂号时间给说成是上午十一点五十五分，说给病人注射了盘尼西林、康福那心，对病人进行了应有的治疗，病人之死和院方无关，把责任推卸干净，欺骗上级。在省的有关机关追查这件事情的时候，他们仍然坚持错误，消积抵抗。这件事情，直到现在还没有得到彻底解决。（附图片）
