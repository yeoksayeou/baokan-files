Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram: The Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Liji Township, Yancheng County, has devised various ways to increase production to compensate for the losses caused by the strong typhoon. After discussions between cooperative cadres and members, it was decided to apply fertilizer again to the well-growing late rice fields, strengthen field management, and control pests, striving to increase production by 40 catties per mu. More than 1,000 mu of late rice could yield over 40,000 catties more. The cooperative, based on the opinions of various production teams, also decided to increase the planting of late autumn crops such as carrots and arrowhead by 25 mu each, which could generate an income of more than 1,000 yuan this year. Utilizing wasteland and the edges of fields to increase the planting of mung beans and expand vegetable gardens could generate an income of more than 5,000 yuan. The cooperative also plans to send 20 members to help the textile company gin cottonseeds after the autumn harvest, which could generate more than 1,000 yuan in wages. With these measures implemented, the cooperative will not only make up for the losses caused by the typhoon but also increase its income by more than 2,000 yuan.

    五星农业社恢复生产办法多
    据新华社南京电　盐城县利济乡五星农业社想出多种增产办法弥补由强台风造成的损失。经过社干部和社员商量，决定在生长较好的晚稻田里再增施一遍肥料，加强田间管理和治虫，争取每亩增产四十斤。一千多亩晚稻就可多收四万多斤。社里又根据各生产队提出的意见，增种晚秋作物胡萝卜、茨菇各二十五亩，今年内可收入一千多元；利用荒地和地头地脑增种绿豆，扩大菜地，可以收入五千多元。社里还打算秋收以后派二十个社员帮助纺织品公司轧棉子，能够收入一千多元的工资。这些办法实行了，全社除弥补上台灾损失外，还能增加二千多元的收入。
