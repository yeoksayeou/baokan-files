Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 11th: The Indonesian Parliament unanimously passed a resolution on August 10th expressing support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The resolution expressed the hope that Indonesia could defend national interests at the London conference in accordance with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference. The resolution also requested that in resolving the Suez Canal issue, all relevant countries should consider both freedom of navigation and world peace.

The Indonesian delegation to the twenty-four-nation London conference on the Suez Canal issue will depart for London on August 13th. The delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abdulgani.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 11th: An Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on August 10th that the Colombo countries had reached an understanding on the issue of participating in the conference. The Colombo countries unanimously believe that Egypt has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal. The Asian-African countries participating in the conference will act in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference—that is, the principle that international disputes should be resolved peacefully. These countries have also reached an understanding that the dignity and sovereignty of Egypt must be respected at the conference.

The spokesman also said that the decision to participate in the conference was made after the United Kingdom made an explanation, saying that any country participating in the conference could put forward proposals and suggestions, so participation in the conference did not mean being bound by the opinions of the three major powers.

In answering a reporter's question, the spokesman said that Indonesia's participation in the conference means that we have some opinions to put forward as a constructive contribution to the peaceful resolution of this issue.

    印度尼西亚外交部发言人说亚非国家已取得谅解
    要在伦敦会议上按万隆精神行事
    印度尼西亚国会支持埃及收回苏彝士运河
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚国会八月十日一致通过了一项决议，表示支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有。决议表示希望印度尼西亚能够在伦敦会议上根据亚非会议的精神来保卫民族利益。决议还要求在解决苏彝士运河问题的时候，有关各国既要考虑航行自由，也要考虑世界和平。
    出席讨论苏彝士运河问题的二十四国伦敦会议的印度尼西亚代表团将在八月十三日启程前往伦敦。这个代表团将由外交部长阿卜杜加尼率领。
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人八月十日说，科伦坡国家已经就参加会议问题取得谅解。科伦坡国家一致认为埃及完全有权把苏彝士运河收归国有。参加会议的亚非国家将按照万隆会议原则——即国际纠纷应当和平解决的原则——来行事。这些国家还取得这样的谅解：在会议上一定要尊重埃及的尊严和主权。
    这位发言人还说，参加会议的决定是在英国作了解释以后作出的，英国方面说，任何参加会议的国家都可以提出方案和建议，因此，参加会议并不等于受三大国的意见的约束。
    这位发言人在答复记者的问题的时候说，印度尼西亚参加会议就意味着我们有一些意见要提出，作为对和平解决这个问题的建设性的贡献。
