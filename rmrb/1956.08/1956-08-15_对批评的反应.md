Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs letter:

    After reading the article "Why only the lower levels are anxious," published in your newspaper on July 2nd, which criticized the Department's sluggish handling of official documents and excessive issuance of documents, we immediately conducted a review. The phenomenon of issuing documents without considering the actual situation at the lower levels, subjectively demanding rapid processing, and failing to respond promptly to questions submitted by the lower levels does exist.

    In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings in our work, we plan to conduct further investigation. At the same time, we will improve the follow-up system and the work responsibility system to prevent similar occurrences.

    对批评的反应浙江省民政厅来信：
    七月二日你报登载“为什么光叫下边急”一文批评本厅公文处理拖拉，下发公文过多，我们看了后，即进行了检查。我们在下发公文中不考虑下边实际情况，即主观要求急速办理，而对下边请示的问题，却不及时答复，这种现象是存在的。
    为了切实克服这些工作中的缺点，我们准备再作进一步的检查，同时把催办制度和工作责任制度健全起来，以防止类似现象的发生。
