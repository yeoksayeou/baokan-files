Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: Over ten thousand railway workers braved the rain on the 5th to rush repair work on various main railway lines that had been washed away by floods. By the 6th, the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways had resumed normal traffic, and all trains held up on the Beijing-Hankou line had safely departed. On the 6th, another seven thousand people were concentrated along the Shi(jiazhuang)-Tai(yuan) railway line, rushing to repair mountain tunnels and roadbeds that had collapsed due to the floods. It is expected that the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line can be opened to traffic on the 8th. The local government has arranged living arrangements for the thousand-plus passengers stranded near the Weishui station on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line.

From the 2nd to the 5th, due to the sudden attack of typhoons and rainstorms, mountain floods broke out in East China and North China, and rivers overflowed, washing away dozens of sections of roadbeds on the Beijing-Hankou, Longhai, and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railways. In some places, the steel rails were also bent or washed away one or two hundred meters away.

Since the railway administrations had already established flood prevention headquarters in advance, and each engineering section along the railway lines had established a repair team, as soon as they received news of the railway being washed away, they immediately dispatched rescue trains carrying a large number of sleepers, rubble, ballast, straw bags, and sacks to the flood-stricken areas. Railway workers worked tirelessly day and night in the pouring rain to repair the roadbeds that had been washed away by the floods. Therefore, most of the damaged lines were quickly repaired, some being repaired as they were damaged. The Zhe(jiang)-Gan(xi) Railway, which was first cut off by the floods on the 2nd, resumed traffic the next day. The Pukou and Hankou ferry services, which had been temporarily suspended on the 2nd due to strong winds, had also quickly resumed operation. Although the roadbeds of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways were submerged in floodwaters ranging from one foot to three or four feet deep in many sections, and many places were damaged, traffic was quickly restored after the floodwaters receded. Currently, only the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line and the Nantongpu line are still under intense repair.

### 上万铁路职工抢修被洪水冲断的铁路  京汉陇海两铁路恢复通车

    上万铁路职工抢修被洪水冲断的铁路
    京汉陇海两铁路恢复通车
    据新华社6日讯　上万的铁路职工在五日冒雨抢修被洪水冲断的各条铁路干线。到六日，京汉、陇海两条铁路已经恢复正常通车，被阻在京汉线上的各次列车都已经安全开出。六日还有七千人正集中在石（家庄）太（原）铁路沿线抢修被洪水冲坍的山洞和路基。预计石太线在八日可以通车。被阻在石太线微水车站附近的千余旅客，已经由当地政府安排生活问题。
    从二日到五日间，因为台风和暴雨的突然袭击，华东、华北地区山洪暴发，河水泛滥，把京汉、陇海、石太等铁路的路基冲断了几十处。有的地方铁路钢轨也被冲弯或冲到了一两百公尺以外。
    由于各铁路管理局事先都已经成立了防洪指挥部，沿铁路线各工务段成立了抢修队，当得到铁路被冲断的消息之后，立刻就出动了抢险列车，带着大量的枕木、片石、石碴、草袋、麻袋赶到洪水泛滥地区。铁路职工在倾盆大雨之中，不分昼夜紧张地抢修被洪水冲断的路基。因此，被冲坏的线路大部分很快就被修复了，有的随坏随修。最先在二日被洪水冲断的浙赣路在第二天就恢复通车。因风势太大在二日一度停航的浦口和汉口的轮渡，也已经迅速复航。京汉和陇海路虽然许多地段路基被一尺多到三、四尺深的洪水淹没，冲毁了许多处，但是水势下落后，很快就修复通车了。现在，只有石太线和南同蒲线还在紧张抢修之中。
