Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 26th -- The Shizitan Hydropower Station's reservoir in Sichuan has begun impounding water, and the power station will soon officially generate electricity. As of August 25th, the reservoir had already impounded more than 150 million cubic meters of water. Now, standing on the dam of the reservoir, one can see this beautiful artificial lake taking shape. All buildings and residents within the reservoir area have long been completely demolished and relocated. The Longxi River water flowing into the reservoir has turned several small hills originally scattered in the reservoir area into green islands.

The impoundment of water at the Shizitan Reservoir has created important conditions for the power station to generate electricity ahead of schedule this year. The reservoir has a total area of ​​63 square kilometers and a storage capacity of more than 820 million cubic meters. The reservoir is designed for multi-year regulation. In addition to supplying the Shizitan Hydropower Station with water for power generation during the annual dry season, the impounded floodwaters can also regulate flood years and dry years, ensuring that there is no water shortage in dry years.

The impoundment of water at the Shizitan Reservoir also has a significant effect on several hydropower stations previously built in the Longxi River basin. The natural flow of the Longxi River is not large. In the past, the Shangdong and Xiadong power stations built on this river relied on natural flow for power generation. Every year, the power generation was very low during the dry season, or even completely stopped. Because the Shizitan Reservoir is built at the uppermost point of the several power stations already built in the Longxi River basin, after it impounds water, the power stations below can change the past embarrassing situation of "relying on the heavens for food" during the dry season.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 26th -- The construction project of the Shizitan Hydropower Station in Sichuan has entered the tense construction phase before power generation.

As of August 20th, more than 80% of the planned workload of the entire construction project of this power station had been completed. At present, the dam has been poured to the predetermined height, and the reservoir has been officially impounded. The main components of the first generator set have been installed, and the second and third units are also under intense installation.

The Shizitan Hydropower Station, originally planned to start generating electricity at the end of this year, can be completed in September; the power generation time can be two to three months ahead of the original plan.

In the past two months, the workers building the Shizitan Hydropower Station have launched a socialist competition to strive for early power generation. The surge tank project was originally planned to take three months to complete, but now they have taken measures from all aspects and decided to strive to complete it in two months. Since the installation team began installation, almost every installation project has been completed ahead of schedule. July was the first month that the new 1956 quota was officially implemented at this construction site, and more than 80% of the workers on the entire construction site exceeded the new quota target. During this tense construction phase, responsible cadres such as the director, party secretary, and chief engineer of the Shizitan Hydropower Engineering Bureau all moved to the site to work and personally directed the construction of key projects such as the water diversion system and electromechanical installation. The Engineering Bureau and various work areas transferred hundreds of cadres and workers to support the weak links in the construction.

### 龙溪河上出现了美丽的人工湖  狮子滩水库开始蓄水  水电站将提前两三个月发电

    龙溪河上出现了美丽的人工湖
    狮子滩水库开始蓄水
    水电站将提前两三个月发电
    新华社重庆26日电　四川狮子滩水电站的水库开始蓄水，不久电站就要正式发电。到8月25日，水库已经蓄水一亿五千多万立方公尺。现在，站在水库的拦河大坝上，可以看见这座美丽的人工湖正在形成。水库范围以内所有的建筑物和居民，都早已全部拆除和迁移。流进水库的龙溪河水，已经把原来散布在水库区内的几个小山丘变成了绿色的小岛。
    狮子滩水库蓄水，为电站提前在今年发电创造了重要条件。这座水库的面积共有六十三平方公里，蓄水量可达八亿二千多万立方公尺。水库是按多年调剂设计的，所拦蓄的洪水除了供给狮子滩水电站在每年枯水季节发电的需要外，还可以使洪水年与枯水年互相调剂，保证枯水年不致缺水。
    狮子滩水库蓄水对于过去建设在龙溪河流域的几座水电站也有很大作用。龙溪河水的天然流量不大，过去建设在这条河流上的上硐及下硐等电站依靠天然流量发电，每年到了枯水季节发电量很少，甚至完全停止发电。狮子滩水库由于建设在龙溪河流域已经建成的几座电站的最上面，它蓄水以后，下面的几座电站在枯水期就可以改变过去“靠天吃饭”的困窘状态。
    新华社重庆26日电　四川狮子滩水电站的建设工程，已经进入发电前的紧张施工阶段。
    到8月20日为止，这个电站的全部建设工程已经完成了计划工程量的80％以上。目前拦河大坝已经浇筑到预定高度，水库已经正式蓄水。第一台发电机组的主要机件已经安装完了，第二台和第三台也正在紧张进行安装。
    原计划在今年年底开始发电的狮子滩水电站，在9月份就可以建设完工了；发电的时间可比原来计划提前两个月到三个月。
    最近两个月来，建设狮子滩水电站的职工开展了争取提前发电的社会主义竞赛。调压井工程原来计划要三个月才能完工，现在他们从各方面采取措施，决定争取两个月完成。安装队职工从开始安装以来，几乎每一项安装工程都比计划提前完工。7月份是这个工地正式实行1956年新定额的第一个月，全工地有80％以上的工人都突破了新定额指标。在这紧张的施工阶段，狮子滩水力发电工程局局长、党委书记、总工程师等负责干部，都搬到现场办公，亲自指挥引水系统和机电安装等关键工程的施工。工程局和各个工区抽调了几百名干部和工人，支援施工中的薄弱环节。（附图片）
