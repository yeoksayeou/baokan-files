Xinhua News Agency, August 27th dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian Foreign Ministry accused France and Britain on the 26th of exerting "diplomatic pressure" on the governments of "certain countries" in an attempt to prevent pilots from those countries from signing contracts with Egypt to work in the Suez Canal.

The Foreign Ministry's accusation was based on reports from Egyptian embassies abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th dispatch from Paris: The former Suez Canal Company issued a statement in London on August 26th aimed at disrupting navigation in the Suez Canal. The statement described certain administrative measures taken by the Egyptian management authorities of the Suez Canal Company as "interference" at "all levels" of the company and "intimidation" of employees, and insisted that the "personal safety and property safety" of the canal company's employees were in an "unreliable state." The statement implied that the non-Egyptian staff of the canal company should resign.

The head of the former Suez Canal Company said that the above statement had been notified to the company's staff in Egypt, and that instructions would be given to them in the future through foreign consulates in Egypt.

    新华社27日讯　开罗消息：埃及外交部26日指责法国和英国对“某些国家”的政府施加“外交压力”，企图阻止这些国家的领航人员和埃及签订关于在苏彝士运河工作的合同。
    外交部的这种指责是根据埃及驻外国大使馆的报告而提出的。
    据新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：前苏彝士运河公司8月26日在伦敦发表了目的在于破坏苏彝士运河航行的声明。这个声明把苏彝士运河公司的埃及管理当局采取的一些行政措施说成是对公司“所有各级”的“干涉”和对雇员的“威迫”，并且硬说运河公司职工的“个人安全和财产安全处在不可靠的状况”。声明示意运河公司的非埃及籍工作人员离职。
    前苏彝士运河公司的负责人说，上述声明已经通知在埃及的公司工作人员，而且今后还要通过外国在埃及的领事馆对他们给予指示。
