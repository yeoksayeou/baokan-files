Xinhua News Agency, Jiangling, August 24th: At the Hao Xue wharf on the Yangtze River and more than a dozen wharves such as Shayang on the Han River, dock workers are loading large quantities of superior wheat seeds onto ships, transported by farmers from the Jingzhou Special Zone of Hubei Province and the state-owned farms there, to support farmers in the disaster-stricken provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan.

On August 22nd, this special zone shipped another 18 million jin of "Nanda" superior wheat seeds, 5 million jin of local superior wheat seeds, and 2 million jin of local superior barley seeds "June Yellow" to Anhui Province. Including the wheat seeds previously transferred to Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu, a total of 40 million jin has been shipped.

Before shipment, these wheat seeds were tested and proven to be of good quality, with a germination rate generally above 80% or 90%.

When the middle reaches of the Yangtze River experienced severe flooding in 1954, people across the country provided enthusiastic support to the Jingzhou Special Zone, which was the most severely affected. Farmers in Jingzhou ate grain shipped from Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces and planted seeds sent from other places. Now, when Jingzhou farmers heard the news that these provinces had suffered from floods and typhoons, they expressed deep concern for the people in the disaster areas.

    优良麦种支援灾区
    据新华社江陵24日电　在长江的郝穴码头和汉江的沙洋等十几个码头上，码头工人正在把湖北省荆州专区的农民和那里的国营农场运来的大批优良麦种装船启运，支援受灾的安徽、江苏、河南等省农民。
    八月二十二日，这个专区又给安徽省运去了“南大”小麦良种一千八百万斤，当地小麦良种五百万斤，当地大麦良种“六月黄”二百万斤。连前次调运给安徽、河南、江苏的麦种在内，总共运去了四千万斤。
    这一批麦种启运前，经过检验证明质量都很好，发芽率一般在百分之八九十以上。
    当1954年长江中游地区发生大水以后，全国各地人民对受灾最重的荆州专区给予了热情的支援。荆州农民吃过安徽、江苏和河南等省运来的粮食，种过外地送来的种子。现在，当荆州农民听到这些省分遭到水灾和台风灾害的消息后，对灾区人民深切关怀。
