Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th. Four Jiaotong University students interning at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory are to receive a rationalization proposal award from the factory.

They are Hong Yuchen, Pu Jisheng, Chai Peiqi, and Huang Wenhao, students from the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University. During their internship at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory this summer, they discovered that a lathe specifically for machining worms had to be shut down for five hours every day and undergo major repairs every seven or ten days, which greatly hindered production. During operation, the lathe had to reverse direction every two seconds, causing the motor to be overloaded and overheat, leading to frequent breakdowns. This had become a long-standing, unresolved problem for the factory. Based on the principle of a slip-ring motor, they suggested modifying the lathe's motor to solve the problems of overload and overheating during reversing by increasing resistance and reducing current. The factory adopted their suggestion, and the old electrician Shi Chuquan helped with the modification, which has now been successfully tested. According to the calculations of the Rationalization Proposal Committee, the implementation of this rationalization proposal will reduce downtime by 696 hours per year, save 3,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and reduce many repair costs. Therefore, it was decided to award Hong Yuchen and others bonuses in accordance with the prescribed reward measures.

    交大实习生获得合理化建议奖金
    新华社上海29日电　在上海机床厂实习的四个交通大学学生，将要得到该厂发给的一项合理化建议奖金。
    他们是交通大学电器工艺系的学生洪雨辰、浦稷生、柴佩琪和黄文豪。今年暑期他们在上海机床厂实习的时候，发现有一台专门车削蜗杆的车床每天要停工五小时，每隔七天或十天就要大修理，对生产妨碍很大。这台车床在操作中必须每两秒钟就要倒顺车一次，车床电动机负荷过重，温度过高，因此经常损坏，已经成为该厂一项长期没有解决的问题。他们根据一种滑环式电动机的原理，建议把这台车床的电动机改装，用增大电阻、减小电流的办法解决倒顺车中电动机负荷过重、温度过高的问题。这项建议经厂方采纳后，就由老电工施褚泉帮助改装，现在已经试验成功。根据合理化建议委员会的计算，这一项合理化建议实现的结果，该厂每年可以减少六百九十六个小时的停工损失，节约三千六百度电和许多修理费用，因此决定按照规定的奖励办法发给洪雨辰等奖金。
