The Creed of a "Good Official"
    Zhu Li

In the old society, there was a type of "good official" whose creed was "Let them laugh or curse as they will, I will still be a good official." There is an essential difference between the leading personnel of our new society and the "officials" of the old society, which doesn't need much explanation. At the same time, in our society, the people have democratic rights, and they can raise opinions about any work and criticize the shortcomings of any leading personnel. There is no need to "laugh or curse." However, some leading personnel understand the mystery of "Let them laugh or curse as they will, I will still be a good official," and they are truly learning to be "good officials."

The true attitude of a "good official" towards the opinions and criticisms raised by the masses is: you can raise opinions as much as you want; you can criticize as much as you like; but I will not accept your opinions, and I will not sincerely correct my shortcomings. Sometimes, under the pressure of the masses, the "good official" will also express a "humble acceptance" of the opinions and criticisms raised by the masses. However, the expression is just an expression, and after the expression, the problem is not dealt with, and the shortcomings are still not corrected.

What are the consequences? The consequence is that fewer and fewer people raise opinions and criticisms, and the world seems to be at peace. In fact, this kind of "peaceful" atmosphere is a corrosive that wears down the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff and workers, and it is an obstacle to the real promotion of democracy. But the "good official" seems unable to see it.

So, what should be done? In addition to asking the higher authorities to strengthen effective help for the "good official," the leaders must resolutely raise opinions and resolutely criticize, and must not relax. It is very necessary for people to learn from the example of those responsible doctors who cannot casually let a patient leave the hospital until they have cured him.

    “好官”的信条
    朱力
    旧社会里有一种“好官”，他们的信条是“笑骂由他笑骂，好官我自为之”。我们新社会的领导人员，跟旧社会的“官”有本质上的不同，这是用不着多说的了。同时，在我们的社会里，人民都有民主权利，对任何工作有意见都可以提，对任何领导人员的缺点都可以批评，“笑骂”是大可不必的。然而，有的领导人员却懂得“笑骂由他笑骂，好官我自为之”的奥妙，他真正学起“好官”来了。
    “好官”对群众提出来的意见和批评的真实态度是：意见，你们可以尽量提；批评，你们尽管批评；可是你们的意见我就是不接受，我的缺点就是不真改。有时，在群众的压力之下，“好官”对群众提的意见和批评也表示一下“虚心接受”。可是，表示也不过是表示而已，表示之后，问题并不处理，缺点仍然不改。
    后果怎样呢？后果是：提意见、提批评的人愈来愈少，天下好像太平起来了。实际上，这种“太平”空气是消磨工作人员的积极性和创造性的腐蚀剂，是真正发扬民主的障碍。可是“好官”好像看不到。
    那末，怎么办呢？除了请上级对“好官”加强有效的帮助而外，被领导者们还得坚决提意见、坚决批评才是，千万不能松劲。人们很有必要学习那些负责任的大夫的榜样，没有把病人治好，就不能马马虎虎让他出院。
