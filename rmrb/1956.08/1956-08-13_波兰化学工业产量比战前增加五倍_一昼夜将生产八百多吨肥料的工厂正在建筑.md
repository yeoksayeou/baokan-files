Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 11th: Since liberation, Poland has built nearly fifty new chemical industrial enterprises, and almost all of the existing chemical factories have been expanded, renovated and modernized. Currently, the output of Poland's entire chemical industry is almost five times greater than before World War II, and it can now produce around five hundred new chemical products that Poland did not produce in the past.

The production of artificial fertilizers has increased significantly. At present, nitrogen fertilizer production has increased to about four times the pre-war level, and phosphate fertilizer has increased to more than three and a half times.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1950-1955), construction began on Poland's largest chemical complex in Kędzierzyn, Silesia, and some of its factories have already gone into production. For example, its nitrogen fertilizer plant currently produces approximately 40% of Poland's total nitrogen fertilizer output. The construction of the combined enterprise is still being carried out extensively. A second nitrogen fertilizer plant is under construction, and this plant will soon be put into production, producing 850 tons of fertilizer per day.

    波兰化学工业产量比战前增加五倍
    一昼夜将生产八百多吨肥料的工厂正在建筑
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰在解放以来建成了将近五十个新的化学工业企业，原有的化学工厂也几乎全部得到了扩建和改建得现代化了。现在，波兰整个化学工业的产量差不多比第二次世界大战前增加了五倍，它目前可以生产波兰过去没有生产过的五百种左右的新化学产品。
    人造肥料的生产有了显著的增加。现在，氮肥已经增加到战前水平的四倍左右，磷肥增加到三倍半以上。
    在六年计划期间（1950—1955年），开始在西里西亚的肯杰仁建设的波兰规模最大的化学联合企业，有些工厂已经投入生产。例如它的氮肥工厂目前所生产的氮肥已经占波兰氮肥总产量的40％左右。联合企业的建筑工程现在还在广泛地进行。第二个氮肥工厂正在建筑中，这个工厂不久就可以投入生产，它一昼夜将生产八百五十吨肥料。
