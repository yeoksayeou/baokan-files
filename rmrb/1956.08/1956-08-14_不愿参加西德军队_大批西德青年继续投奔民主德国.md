Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 11th: More and more West German youths are fleeing to the German Democratic Republic to live a life of peaceful labor, unwilling to be conscripted into the West German army.

Now, the reception station in Schöneberg receives thirty to forty people fleeing from West Germany every day. This number is double what it was before the West German parliament passed the conscription law.

In the first three weeks of July alone, 300 West German residents came to the German Democratic Republic through the Eisenach reception station.

According to the German News Agency, many people from West Germany have found work in factories and agricultural production cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic. Many industrial and agricultural production units in the German Democratic Republic have announced that they are ready to recruit more West German compatriots to engage in peaceful labor together.

    不愿参加西德军队
    大批西德青年继续投奔民主德国
    据新华社柏林11日电　越来越多的西德青年投奔到德意志民主共和国过和平劳动的生活，而不愿被征去参加西德军队。
    现在，绍尼堡的收容站每天要接待三四十个从西德逃来的人。这个数字比西德议会通过征兵法以前多一倍。
    在七月份的头三个星期中，仅仅通过埃森纳赫收容站到民主德国来的西德居民就有三百人。
    据德意志通讯社报道，从西德来的许多人都在民主德国的工厂和农业生产合作社里参加了工作。民主德国的许多工农业生产单位宣布，它们还准备吸收更多的西德同胞一起来从事和平劳动。
