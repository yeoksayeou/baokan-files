Abstract of Local Newspaper Commentary,
    Less Blame, More Help
    The "Jilin Daily" published a commentary on the 2nd of August entitled "Less Blame, More Help," criticizing the shortcomings of some grassroots Communist Party organizations, which tend to blame rather than help their members. The commentary said: A Communist Party member burst into tears just after leaving the Party Congress meeting. Why was he crying? It turned out that he had been inappropriately criticized at the meeting. He said, "I'm busy to death every day, and you still 'lecture' us for not being active enough in our work. What exactly am I supposed to do to be considered right!"
    The commentary then cited the fact that some grassroots Party organizations are currently adopting crude attitudes toward Party members. At a Party Congress of the Baiquan Township General Branch in Xi'an County, Jilin Province, the meeting went on until midnight, all spent criticizing Party members, saying this was wrong and that was not right, without praising a single good thing. The commentary said, "Does this Party General Branch with hundreds of members not have some good Party members? It's just that the Party leaders here haven't paid attention to and promoted the positive factors, but only used negative criticism to deal with negative factors."
    The Jizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative Branch in Yafu Township, Yongji County, Jilin Province, had not held a dedicated Party work meeting for seven months in the past. When something needed to be done, they would just grab the production team leader and then call on Party members to take the lead in completing the task. Some Party members felt very distressed because they had no direction in their work, and some Party members just worked blindly, regardless of whether they were doing it right or not. The commentary said: To only call on Party members to take the lead in completing tasks, without specifically helping Party members overcome the difficulties of lacking experience and methods in their work, thus damaging the enthusiasm of Party members, is a leadership failure of the Party organization. This branch later accepted the lesson of neglecting Party leadership, specifically formulated measures to help improve the level of Party members, assigned tasks to Party members in detail, and explained the working methods to Party members. As a result, Party members became active.
    The commentary pointed out: Caring for Party members, cherishing Party members, and actively helping to improve Party members are important responsibilities of Party organizations and are also the prerequisites for giving play to the enthusiasm of Party members and doing good work. Unfortunately, some Party organizations not only do not do this, but also find many excuses, such as saying that Party members' levels are too low; or that Party members are too young and too naive; or that Party members are too old to accept new things, and so on. Is it true that if one's "level is low," one cannot do Party work? The commentary cited facts to prove that as long as Party members with different levels of awareness and work ability are given practical requirements, Party members with "low levels" can also improve and do good work.
    The commentary concluded: Less blame, more help, does not mean weakening or obliterating criticism and self-criticism within the Party. The political ideology and awareness level of Party members are gradually improved through Party education and work practice. When Party members' awareness is improved, they will not tolerate some of the shortcomings and bad phenomena within the Party. In this way, the democratic life and criticism and self-criticism within the Party will only be strengthened, not weakened. (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 5th)

### 少责难，多帮助

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    少责难，多帮助
    “吉林日报”二日以“少责难，多帮助”为题发表评论，批评目前一些共产党的基层组织对党员责备多、帮助少的缺点。这篇评论说：有个共产党员，刚刚走出党员大会的会场就哭了起来。他为什么要哭呢？原来在会上不适当地批评了他。他说：“一天忙的要死，还‘训’我们工作不积极，到底怎样做才算对呢！”
    评论接着又举出了目前有些基层党组织采取粗暴的态度对待党员的事实。吉林省西安县白泉乡总支的一次党员大会开到半夜都是在批评党员，这个不对，那个不是，没有表扬一个好的。评论说：“难道这个有上百名党员的党总支，就没有一些好的党员吗？只是这里党的领导者没有注意和发扬积极因素，仅仅用消极的批评对待消极因素而已。”
    吉林省永吉县亚复乡集庄农业生产合作社分支部，过去有七个月没有开过专门党的工作会议。有事只抓生产队长，然后号召党员带头完成任务。有的党员因为工作没有方向感到很苦闷，有的党员不管对不对只是蒙头干。评论说：像这样只号召党员带头完成任务，而不具体帮助党员克服工作中缺少的经验和缺少办法的困难，因而损害了党员的工作积极性，这是党组织领导上的过失。这个分支部后来接受了忽视党的领导的教训，具体制订了帮助提高党员水平的办法，详细地给党员分配了任务，向党员交待了工作方法，这样，党员就积极起来了。
    评论指出：关心党员，爱护党员，积极帮助提高党员，是党组织的重要职责，也是发挥党员积极性作好工作的前提。可惜有些党的组织不但没有这样作，反而找出许多借口，或者说党员水平太低；或者说党员太年轻太幼稚；或者说党员年纪太大，不能接受新鲜事物，等等。是否“水平低”就不能做党的工作呢？评论列举事实证明：只要对觉悟和工作能力不同的党员提出符合实际的要求，“水平低”的党员也是可以提高和做好工作的。
    评论最后说：少责难，多帮助，并不是削弱和抹煞党内的批评和自我批评。党员的政治思想和觉悟水平是在党的教育和工作实践中逐渐提高的。党员的觉悟提高了，他们也就不会容忍党内的一些缺点和坏现象了。这样党内的民主生活和批评与自我批评就只有加强，不会削弱。　（新华社长春5日电）
