Xinhua News Agency report: The workers of all ethnic groups developing the Karamay Oilfield overcame the scorching heat of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit and completed the July drilling plan two days ahead of schedule.

In July, the temperature in the Karamay area rose to over 120 degrees Fahrenheit several times, exceeding the highest historical temperature in the Turpan Basin, known as the "Land of Fire." At the same time, the July drilling task increased by 23.3% compared to June. The consumption of water for engineering and daily life also increased this month. The water supply distance is generally as long as 40 kilometers. Cars transporting water in the Gobi Desert braved the high temperatures, causing water tanks to boil constantly and tires to burst frequently, which often prevented the timely supply of drilling and domestic water. Workers of all ethnic groups had high morale in such hot weather. Drilling workers working under the scorching sun often had cracked lips due to lack of drinking water. Many drilling teams were forced to suspend work due to insufficient drilling water supply. When the water was delivered, they devised various methods to make up for the work lost during the shutdown. The water transport drivers used their rest time to jointly repair damaged vehicles and worked around the clock to basically ensure the domestic water supply for the workers. In July, although each drilling team suspended work several times due to the shortage of water and equipment, they still completed seven exploratory wells on time.

    克拉玛依油田职工战胜酷暑
    据新华社讯　开发克拉玛依油田的各族职工战胜华氏一百二十多度的炎热气候，提前两天完成了七月份的钻井计划。
    七月份，克拉玛依地区的气温曾几次上升到华氏一百二十度以上，超过号称“火洲”的吐鲁番盆地历史上最高气温。同时，七月份钻井任务又较六月份增加了23.3％。这个月工程和生活方面的用水量也增加了。供水距离一般都长达四十多公里，冒着高温在戈壁滩上运水的汽车，水箱不断沸腾，轮胎经常爆破，使得钻井和生活用水经常不能按时供应。各族职工在这样的炎热气候里，劳动情绪很高。在烈日下工作的钻井工人，常常因为没有足够的饮水，嘴唇都干得裂了缝。许多钻井队因钻井用水供应不上一度停工。当水运到了以后，他们想出种种办法补上停工期间的工作量。运水的驾驶员们利用休息时间来共同修理损坏了的车辆，日夜轮流工作，基本上保证了职工的生活用水。七月份各井队虽然都因为水和器材供应不上而几次停工，但是仍然按时钻完了七口探井。
