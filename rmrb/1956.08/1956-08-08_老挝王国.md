    The Kingdom of Laos is a constitutional monarchy located on the Indochinese Peninsula. It borders China to the north, Vietnam to the east, Thailand and Myanmar to the west, and Cambodia to the south. It has an area of 220,000 square kilometers. The north and east are entirely rugged mountains and continuous forests, while the Mekong River basin in the south is a fertile plain.

    Laos has a population of approximately three million, comprising more than thirty ethnic groups, with the Lao people accounting for more than half, and the rest mainly consisting of the Khmu and Hmong peoples, among others. Most residents are Buddhist.

    Laos is an ancient cultural country of the East. In its heyday in the 13th century, it was one of the most prosperous countries in Southeast Asia. The Lao capital, Vientiane, and the old capital, Luang Prabang, still preserve relics of ancient culture.

    In 1893, after occupying Vietnam and Cambodia, French colonialists invaded Laos and turned it into a French "protectorate." From the first day of the French invasion of Laos, the Lao people never ceased their armed struggle against colonial rule. During World War II, in March 1945, Japanese troops invaded Laos. The French colonialists fled in panic, and the Lao people launched another anti-Japanese struggle.

    In August 1945, encouraged by the victory of the Vietnamese "August Revolution," the Lao people seized power from the Japanese on October 12, 1945, and established the "Lao People's Committee" in Vientiane, forming a temporary anti-Japanese government, formulating the Lao Independent Constitution, and declaring Lao independence. In November, the King of Laos abdicated.

    In March 1946, French colonialists, under the pretext of disarming the Japanese troops, invaded Laos again with the assistance of British and Australian troops. In April 1946, the Kingdom of Laos government was re-established. In October 1953, France and Laos signed a "Treaty of Friendship and Association," recognizing Lao independence, but it remained part of the French Union.

    Under the frenzied attacks of the French colonialists, some leaders of the provisional government fled to Thailand, and some patriots retreated to the eastern border, establishing the "Lao Liberation Committee" to continue the armed struggle. In August 1950, the first People's Congress was held, forming the Lao Free Unified Front, and establishing the Resistance Government with Prince Souphanouvong as Prime Minister.

    The Lao People's Armed Forces continued to grow and become stronger. By 1954, the Lao fighting forces had liberated half of the country and nearly one million people. The three provinces of Sam Neua, Phongsaly, and Attapeu were completely liberated. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Lao fighting forces complied with the Geneva Accords and gathered in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, pending a political solution.

    In March of this year, the Kingdom of Laos government formed a new cabinet headed by Souvanna Phouma. In early August, representatives of the Lao fighting forces and the Lao Kingdom government held a meeting in Vientiane and reached an agreement on a political solution, which will have a beneficial impact on the peace of Indochina and Asia.

    老挝王国
    老挝是一个君主立宪的国家，位于印度支那半岛，北邻我国，东接越南，西面和泰国缅甸相毗邻，南连柬埔寨。面积二十二万平方公里。北部和东部全是险峻的山岭和连绵不断的森林，南部湄公河流域是一片肥沃的平原。
    老挝约有三百万人口，包括三十多个民族，其中寮族占一半以上，其余主要是卡族和苗族等。居民多半信奉佛教。
    老挝是东方的文化古国，在十三世纪的全盛时代，它曾是东南亚最繁荣的国家之一。老挝的首都万象和旧都琅勃刺邦现在还保存着古代文化的遗迹。
    1893年，法国殖民者继占领越南和柬埔寨以后，侵占了老挝，并把它变为法国的“保护国”。从法国侵入老挝的第一天起，老挝人民就从未停止过反对殖民统治的武装斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，1945年3月，日本军队侵入老挝，法国殖民者仓皇逃跑了，老挝人民从此又掀起了抗日的斗争。
    1945年8月，日本投降后，由于越南“八月革命”胜利的鼓舞，老挝人民在1945年10月12日从日本手中夺回政权，并在万象成立了“老挝人民委员会”，组成临时抗战政府，制定老挝独立宪法，宣布老挝独立。十一月，老挝国王宣布退位。
    1946年3月，法国殖民者借口解除日军武装在英、澳军队的援助下又侵入老挝。1946年4月，老挝王国政府重新成立。1953年10月，法国与老挝签订了“友好联合条约”承认老挝独立，但仍为法国联邦的一部分。
    在法国殖民者的疯狂进攻下，临时政府的部分领袖逃入泰国，一部分爱国者就退到东部边境，建立“寮国解放委员会”继续坚持武装斗争。1950年8月，举行了第一次人民代表大会，组成了寮国自由统一战线，成立了以苏发努冯为总理的抗战政府。
    老挝人民武装力量不断的增长和壮大，到1954年，寮国战斗部队即已解放了半数的国土和近百万的人民。桑怒、丰沙里、阿速坡三省已全部解放。1954年日内瓦会议后，寮国战斗部队遵守日内瓦协议，集结在桑怒和丰沙里两省，以待政治问题的解决。
    今年三月，老挝王国政府组成了以梭发那·富马为首的新内阁。八月初，寮国战斗部队和老挝王国政府的代表在万象举行会议，就政治解决问题取得了协议，这将对印度支那和亚洲的和平发生有利的影响。　（陈汝厚）
