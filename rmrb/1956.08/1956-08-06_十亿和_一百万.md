Title: Ten Billion and "One Million"

　　Recently, a strange advertisement appeared in American newspapers. This advertisement occupied a full page and its title was: "Appeal to the Democratic and Republican Conventions: Do Not Let Communist China Enter the United Nations." The advertisement was published by a so-called "Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United Nations."

　　This so-called "committee" is actually an organization put together by a very small group of the utterly discredited so-called "China Lobby." The most active "executive committee member" in this organization is the well-known U.S. Representative Walter Judd, who takes subsidies from the Chiang Kai-shek Group, claims to be a close friend of Chiang Kai-shek, and is called the "Taiwan Congressman" by others. These people also know that their reputation is not worth much, so they dare not sign their own names, but create the name of a so-called "One Million Signature Committee" to bluff and deceive.

　　But what is the use of posing as "one million signatures"? Today, the countries in the world that have recognized the People's Republic of China have a population of over ten billion. If we add those countries that have de facto recognized China and have extensive cultural and economic ties with China, this number will be even larger. Even if Judd and his ilk really get "signatures" from one million Americans, it is still miserably small compared to ten billion people.

　　The tragedy of people like Judd, who are resolutely hostile to the Chinese people, lies here. Despite the United States using every means to slander China, more and more countries are friendly to China, and more and more people are demanding the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. The vast majority of the American people, as well as political figures with a little insight, also demand a change in the United States' unrealistic policy towards China. This situation makes that small group of people in the United States who are resolutely hostile to China restless and uneasy, and they cannot help but panic. In the United Nations, in the United States Congress, and at various party conferences, they shout hoarsely to express their hostility towards China. However, their shouts have not received attention from the American people, let alone welcome. Therefore, they have no choice but to learn from their backstage bosses' methods of selling goods, using large-scale advertisements to sell these outdated "Cold War" goods to the American people. To discerning people, the larger their advertisements are, the more it shows how desolate their market is. (Ping)

### 十亿和“一百万”

    十亿和“一百万”
    最近，在美国报纸上出现了一幅奇怪的广告。这幅广告占整版的篇幅，它的标题是：“向民主党和共和党大会呼吁：不让共产党中国进入联合国”。刊登这幅广告的是一个所谓“反对接纳共产党中国加入联合国一百万人委员会”。
    这个所谓“委员会”，实际上是倒霉不堪了的所谓“院外援华集团”的极少数的一撮人搞起来的一个组织。在这个组织中最活跃的“执行委员”，是众所周知的拿蒋介石集团的津贴、自称是蒋介石的密友、被别人称做“台湾议员”的美国众议员周以德。这些人也知道自己的声名值不了多少钱了，因而不敢自己署名，而制造这么一个所谓“一百万人签名委员会”的名义来虚张声势。
    但是，冒充“一百万人签名”的名义又有什么用呢？现在，全世界已经承认中华人民共和国的国家，人口超过十亿以上。如果加上那些在事实上承认了中国，同中国有着广泛的文化和经济联系的国家，这个数目就还要大得多。就算周以德之流真的搞到了一百万美国人的“签名”吧，这和十亿人比起来，就渺小得十分可怜。
    周以德之流坚决敌视中国人民的人的悲哀之处，也就是在这里。尽管美国用一切办法来诬蔑中国，同中国友好的国家却越来越多了，要求恢复中国在联合国的合法地位的人也越来越多了。美国绝大多数人民以及稍有见地的政治人物，也要求改变美国对中国的不现实的政策。这种情况使得美国那一小撮坚决敌视中国的分子坐立不安，如坐针毡，不能不手忙脚乱了。在联合国、在美国国会里，在各种政党会议上，他们都力竭声嘶地发出敌视中国的叫嚣。可是，他们这种叫嚣并没有受到美国人民的注意，更不要说欢迎了。因此他们只好学他们的后台老板们推销商品的办法，用大登广告来向美国人民推销这些“冷战”的背时货。对于明眼人来说，他们的广告登得越大，就越说明他们的市场是多么冷落。　（平）
