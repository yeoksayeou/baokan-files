Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 18th. Harbin City Flood Control Commander and Mayor Lü Qi'en told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 18th: Although the Songhua River water level in the Harbin area is gradually and slowly receding, Harbin is facing a very arduous and protracted flood control struggle.

Since the water level began to recede on the 16th, the water level had dropped to 119.83 meters by 5:00 PM on the 18th, but the dangerous situations appearing on the dikes have increased compared to the past. Dikes that have been inundated by high water levels for half a month have experienced seepage, piping (i.e., holes appearing at the foot or body of the dike from which water gushes out), and slope failures in many places. It is also easy for collapses and breaches to occur as the river recedes, so the people of the city are persisting in the fight against the flood.

Lü Qi'en said: In response to the current flood control situation, the Harbin City Flood Control Headquarters has taken emergency measures to strengthen the planning, organization, and discipline of the flood control struggle. Although the dikes in the urban area have been generally raised and reinforced through the first and second phases of flood control projects, some dikes were originally extremely thin and must continue to be reinforced. The third phase of flood control project has already started, and the mobilized materials and manpower are greater than the previous two phases. The Harbin City Flood Control Headquarters has allocated an electric shovel and five bulldozers to support the soil extraction site, and has also newly laid temporary railway tracks for transporting soil. Elite People's Liberation Army troops have been entirely assigned to the critical Guxiang Dike project to take on dike repairs and emergency work. A segment-based responsibility system has also been established for each dike, and dedicated technical personnel are assigned to each dangerous situation to be responsible for technical guidance and monitoring. Patrol, signal, warning, and emergency response teams for each dike have also been organized to ensure that the emerging industrial city of Harbin will not be flooded.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 18th. The first and second phases of dike reinforcement projects in Harbin were basically completed on the 17th. These phases were rushed to completion in just over ten days by one hundred thousand soldiers and civilians working day and night. To rush to complete the first and second phases, a total of more than one million workdays were spent, and more than ten thousand train cars, thousands of cars, carriages, wheelbarrows and other vehicles and ships were used, excavating more than 400,000 cubic meters of earth. The third phase of the dike project is now continuing.

The foundations of the original dikes in Harbin were relatively weak, some built next to waterlogged depressions, and some built on garbage dumps, so they were extremely prone to waterlogging and seepage under prolonged inundation.

The City Flood Control Headquarters recently held a flood control engineering technical exchange meeting, and based on the generally weak foundation of the city's dikes, it was decided to strengthen dike inspection work and formulate construction measures for the third phase of dike reinforcement projects.

### 哈尔滨地区松花江水势续落  十万军民加固堤防工程坚持防汛斗争

    哈尔滨地区松花江水势续落
    十万军民加固堤防工程坚持防汛斗争
    新华社哈尔滨18日电　哈尔滨市防汛总指挥、市长吕其恩十八日对新华社记者说：哈尔滨地区松花江水位虽然逐渐缓慢地回落，但是哈尔滨却面临着一个十分艰巨的持久的防汛斗争。
    自从十六日江水回落以来，到十八日下午五时水位已降到119.83公尺，但各处堤坝出现的险象却比过去增加了。受高水位洪水浸润达半个月的堤坝，好多处都发生了渗水、管涌（即堤脚或堤身上出个窟窿，往外涌水）、脱坡的现象；江水回落时又很容易发生倒堤和溃堤，因此全市人民正坚持不懈地和洪水作斗争。
    吕其恩说：哈尔滨市防汛指挥部针对当前防汛情况，已经采取了紧急措施，加强了防汛斗争的计划性组织性和纪律性。经过第一、二两期防汛工程，市区堤坝虽然已经普遍加高和加固，但是有的堤坝堤身原来极为单薄，必须继续将其加固。目前第三期防汛工程已经动工，动员的物力和人力都大于前两期工程。哈尔滨市防汛指挥部已经调拨了一台电铲和五台推土机支援取土场，并且还新铺设了临时运土铁道。险要的顾乡大堤工程已全部调派精壮的人民解放军担任修堤和抢险工作。各堤坝还建立了分段负责制，每个险象都派专职的技术人员负责技术指导和监视。各堤坝的巡逻、信号、警戒和抢险的队伍也组织起来了，使新兴工业城市哈尔滨决不受洪水的浸入。
    据新华社哈尔滨18日电　哈尔滨市第一、二期堤防加固工程已在十七日基本上完工，第一、二期堤防加固工程是在十多天的时间内经过十万军、民日以继夜地抢修起来的。为了抢修一、二期工程，总共花去了一百多万个工作日，动用了一万多节火车皮、成千上万辆汽车、马车、轱辘马车等各种车辆和船舶，挖掘了四十多万立方公尺的土方。现在继续进行第三期堤防工程。
    哈尔滨市原来各堤坝的基础比较薄弱，有的建在积水的洼田旁边，有的建在垃圾堆上，因此在洪水长期浸润下，极易发生浸水渗水现象。
    市防汛指挥部最近召开了防汛工程技术交流会议，根据市区大堤基础普遍薄弱的情况，决定加强查堤工作和制定第三期加固堤坝工程的施工措施。
