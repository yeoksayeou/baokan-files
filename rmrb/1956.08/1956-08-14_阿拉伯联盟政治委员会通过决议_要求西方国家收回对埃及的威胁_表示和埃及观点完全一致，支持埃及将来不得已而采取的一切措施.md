Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 13th: The Arab League Political Committee passed a resolution at its meeting on August 12th, expressing support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal and demanding that Western powers withdraw their pressure and threats against Egypt.

The meeting was attended by delegations from the nine member states of the Arab League (Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Libya, and Jordan). The meeting was initiated by Syria specifically to discuss measures by Arab countries to support Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal. The resolution stated that the Arab countries agreed with Egypt's decision to nationalize the Egyptian joint-stock Suez Canal Company, and they believed that the canal was an integral part of Egypt. The Egyptian government's action to nationalize the canal was an act of national sovereignty.

The resolution declared that the Arab countries shared the same views as Egypt and fully supported all measures that Egypt might inevitably take in the future.

The Political Committee also requested that Western powers consider peaceful means as the best way to resolve international disputes, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

The resolutions of the Political Committee meeting will be submitted to the Arab League's general assembly for approval.
