Building New Factories Everywhere

    **Shanxi Builds a Batch of Small Factories**

    Shanxi Province is currently constructing forty-one small combined factories in the larger towns along the Datong-Puzhou Railway and in the Taihang and Zhongtiao Mountains. Once completed, these factories will be responsible for repairing new agricultural tools and processing grain for the local agricultural cooperatives. In the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi and the fruit-producing areas of southeastern Shanxi, fifteen oil pressing workshops and two fruit processing plants have also been added. After the completion of these factories and with the use of 40 to 60 kW power generating equipment, the physical labor that farmers spend on grinding flour, milling rice, and pressing oil can be freed up for agricultural production. The large quantities of fruit produced annually in the mountainous areas can be processed locally, reducing the various losses caused by transporting them to distant locations for processing. New agricultural tools for agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas can also be repaired locally.

    Construction on this batch of factories began in June and July, and all will be completed by the end of 1957. After these factories are put into production, they will be managed by the respective counties.

    **Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory Enters Construction Climax**

    The Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory, which began construction in May this year, has entered the climax of its construction phase. The tool and repair workshops of this factory have completed the concrete pouring of the column foundations; the sixty-two reinforced concrete support columns and huge ground beams have also been completed. Construction of the cutting tool factory building, including nine workshops for milling cutters, drill bits, and screw tools, officially broke ground on August 1. The central metal materials warehouse and underground pipeline projects also started construction successively.

    In recent days, flatbed trailers with a load capacity of twenty tons and various types of vehicles have been transporting construction materials, prefabricated components, and machinery and equipment to the construction site more intensely; large cranes and lifting machinery for construction are also being moved to the site one after another. All projects that have started or are about to start have been equipped with rain protection equipment to ensure normal construction during the rainy season.

    **Xi'an Meat Processing Complex Begins Construction**

    A large-scale, modern meat processing complex began construction in Xi'an on August 1.

    It will be the first and largest meat processing complex in the Northwest region. The factory is divided into two sections: slaughtering and cold storage, with main workshops for freezing, refrigeration, and ice making. Most of the production process will use mechanical operation. After the factory is completed, it will be able to slaughter 1,000 pigs, 1,000 sheep, and 100 cattle daily, producing more than 70 tons of frozen meat. It will also process and store aquatic products, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and other non-staple foods; by-products such as pig offal can also be made into more than twenty kinds of spiced preserved meats.

    This factory will be put into production in the second quarter of next year. The products will mainly supply the food needs of people in various cities, towns, industrial and mining areas within Shaanxi, and some products will also be exported.

    **Inner Mongolia Builds Wool Processing Plant**

    A modern state-owned wool processing plant began construction in Jining City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on August 1.

    Inner Mongolia ranks first in the country in cashmere production and third in wool production. The cashmere, wool, and camel hair purchased from the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and agricultural areas of the grasslands contain many impurities such as sand, soil, moisture, and grease. After arriving at the processing plant, through production processes such as sorting, color separation, and wheeling, they can become pure wool and cashmere, which are then packaged by highly efficient baling machines and transported to domestic wool mills or exported. Each workshop in this factory has good dust removal equipment to protect workers' health.

    In addition to the raw materials supplied by Inner Mongolia, cashmere and wool from Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other provinces will also be transported here by rail for processing. After this factory officially goes into production next year, it will be able to process nearly 10,000 tons of cashmere and wool annually.

    **Veterinary Biological Pharmaceutical Factory Goes into Production**

    The newly built Sichuan Provincial Veterinary Biological Pharmaceutical Factory has recently gone into production; about one hundred boxes of medicines are now leaving the factory every day.

    The thirteen kinds of medicines produced by this factory with its current equipment capacity can not only meet the needs of this province but also supply other provinces in large quantities.

    The factory has four production workshops: a hog cholera vaccine workshop, a bacterial vaccine workshop, a bovine and equine serum workshop, and a disinfection culture medium workshop, as well as a by-product processing workshop. In addition, the factory also has a healthy isolation room for animals for experiments, which can raise more than 1,400 pigs, 3,600 white mice, guinea pigs, chickens, sheep, etc.; in the hog cholera vaccine workshop, there is also a pigsty area that can raise 1,500 pigs, which are transferred from the healthy isolation room for use as raw materials for medicines.

    **Liuxi River Hydropower Station Begins Construction**

    A hydropower station is being built on the Liuxi River, a tributary of the downstream Beijiang River in the Pearl River system. The main construction of this hydropower station began on August 3. Before the main construction began, the power plant, mechanical repair plant, and employee dormitories that serve the construction have been established. The road leading to the dam site has also been basically completed.

    The Liuxi River Hydropower Station construction site is located in Conghua County, Guangdong Province. According to the design specifications, the water resources of the Liuxi River will be developed in two stages.

    This hydropower station was surveyed and designed by our country's engineering and technical personnel. The geological conditions here are very good. The dam site is in a narrow gorge with steep walls on both sides, and the geology is all solid granite bedrock; the slope from the dam site to the water turbine is 14 per thousand, with a large natural drop; the distribution of building sites is uniform, allowing for simultaneous construction. Therefore, the project can be completed with less investment and in a shorter period.

    This hydropower station is being built to meet the rapidly growing electricity needs of industrial and mining enterprises in the Guangzhou area and the lives of the people of Guangzhou City. In addition to power generation, it will also play a certain role in irrigation, flood control, navigation, fisheries development, and urban water supply.

    **Xinjiang Expands Several Coal Mines**

    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is working to expand several old coal mines. The expansion project of the local state-owned Urumqi Liudaowan Coal Mine is underway; the expansion projects of another old coking coal mine in the Urumqi coalfield and a coal mine in the Hami area will also begin in August.

    The expansion projects of these coal mines mainly involve adding some equipment and expanding the coal mining face. Therefore, the investment is small, and the results are quick. After the completion of the expansion projects of the two coal mines in the Urumqi coalfield, the production volume will be 2.8 times that of the present. Before the new large-scale coal mines are built, the expansion of these old coal mines can appropriately meet the needs of local industrial and railway development. The coal mine in the Hami area will supply a large amount of raw coal to the Qaidam Basin this year.

    **Building an Automated Dairy Plant**

    A modern dairy plant is being built in Hezuo, the seat of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee in Gansu Province. Sixteen projects, including factory buildings, hydropower stations, offices, and woodworking shops, are currently under construction, and machinery can be installed in the fourth quarter of this year.

    The production process of this factory is fully automated. The factory's hydropower station can supply electricity not only to the factory itself but also to various agencies and residents in Hezuo.

    This factory has received technical and material support from all over the country during its construction. Its main machinery is manufactured in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Dalian, Chongqing, and other places. A group of skilled workers has been transferred from the Northeast, and a group of Tibetan workers has been trained locally, all of whom have mastered the technology. After this factory is put into production in the first quarter of next year, it will use trucks to purchase milk from various pastoral areas. The problem that the milk of herdsmen often sours and spoils because it is not easy to store and transport will be solved.

    到处建设新工厂
    山西兴建一批小型工厂
    山西省正在同蒲铁路沿线和太行、中条等山区的较大城镇兴建四十一座小型联合工厂。这些工厂建成后，将担负修配当地农业社的新式农具和粮食加工等工作。在晋南棉产区和晋东南水果产区，还分别增设了十五个榨油车间和两个水果加工厂。这些工厂建成后，利用四十至六十瓩的动力发电设备，将可腾出农民在磨面、碾米、榨油等方面花费的体力劳动用于农业生产。山区每年大量出产的水果能够就地加工，减少运往远地加工造成的各种损耗。山区农业社的新式农具也可就地修配了。
    这批工厂在今年六、七两月动工，到1957年底全部建成。这些工厂投入生产以后都将交各县管理。成都刃具厂进入施工高潮
    今年五月动工兴建的成都刃具厂，已经开始进入施工高潮。这座工厂的工具和修配厂房，已经完成了柱基的混凝土浇灌工程；六十二根钢筋混凝土支柱，巨大的地梁也都做好了。包括铣刀、钻头、螺丝工具等九个车间的刃具厂房工程，已经在八月一日正式破土。先后开工的还有中央金属材料仓库、地下管道等工程。
    这些天来，载重二十吨的平板拖车和各式汽车，正在载着各种施工材料、预制构件和机器设备，更加紧张地运往工地；施工用的大型吊车、起重机等机械，也在陆续开往现场。所有已经动工和即将动工的工程上都装置了防雨设备，以便在雨季也能正常施工。
    西安肉类联合加工厂动工
    一座规模很大的现代化肉类联合加工厂八月一日在西安动工兴建。
    它将是西北地区第一座最大的肉类联合加工厂，厂内分为屠宰和冷藏两个部分，设有冷冻、冷藏、制冰等主要车间。生产过程大部分将采用机械操作。工厂建成后，每天能宰猪一千头、羊一千只和牛一百头，可以制成冻肉七十多吨。同时将加工和贮藏水产、蛋品、水果、蔬菜等副食品；生猪内脏等副产品，还可以制成二十多种五香腊味。
    这座工厂将在明年第二季度投入生产。产品主要供应陕西境内各城镇、工矿地区人民的食用，同时还有一部分产品出口。
    内蒙古建设绒毛加工厂
    一座现代化的国营绒毛加工厂，八月一日在内蒙古自治区集宁市动工兴建。
    内蒙古的羊绒产量占全国第一位；羊毛产量占全国第三位。从草原上半农半牧区和农业区收购来的羊绒、羊毛和驼毛中，有许多杂质砂土、水份和油污等，到加工厂后，经过择毛、分色、过轮等生产过程就可以成为纯净的毛和绒，最后由效率很高的榨包机打包运送到国内各毛织厂或出口。这个工厂的各个车间都有保护工人健康的良好的吸尘设备。
    这个工厂的原料除由内蒙古供应外，山西、河北、陕西等省的绒毛也将由铁路运到这里来加工。这个工厂明年正式投入生产后，每年可处理将近一万吨绒和毛。兽医生物药品厂投入生产
    新建四川省兽医生物药品厂，最近已经投入生产；现在每天出厂的药品约有一百箱。
    这个厂按今年的设备能力所生产的十三种药品，除了满足本省需要以外，还可以大量供应其他省份。
    这个厂有猪瘟疫苗车间、菌苗车间、牛马血清车间、消毒培养基车间等四个生产车间和一个副产品加工车间。此外，厂里还设有一个可以养一千四百多头猪、三千六百多只小白鼠、天竺鼠、鸡、羊等作试验用的动物健康隔离室；在猪瘟疫苗车间里，还有一个可以养一千五百头猪的猪舍区，这些猪是从健康隔离室转来作药品原料用的。
    流溪河水电站开工
    珠江水系北江下游的支流——流溪河，正在兴建一个水力发电站。这个水电站的主体工程在八月三日开始施工。在主体工程动工以前，为施工服务的动力厂、机械修配厂和职工宿舍已经建立起来。通往拦河坝坝址的公路也已经基本上修筑完成。
    流溪河水电站工地在广东省从化县境内。根据设计规定，流溪河的水力资源将分两级开发。
    这个水电站是我国的工程技术人员勘测设计的。这里的地质条件很好，坝址在两岸壁陡而狭窄的峡谷中，地质全部是坚固的花岗岩磐；从坝址到装水轮机处的坡度达到千分之十四，天然落差很大；建筑物地址分布均匀，可以同时进行施工。因此，能够用较少的投资、在较短的期间内把这个工程完成。
    这个水电站是为满足广州地区的工矿企业和广州市人民生活迅速增长的用电需要而兴建的。它建成以后除了发电以外，对于灌溉、防洪、航运、发展渔业及供给城市用水等，也有一定的作用。
    新疆扩建几处煤矿
    新疆维吾尔自治区正在着手扩建几处旧煤矿。地方国营乌鲁木齐六道湾煤矿的扩建工程正在进行；乌鲁木齐煤田的另一处生产焦煤的旧矿井和哈密地区的一处煤矿的扩建工程，也将在八月份开工。
    这几处煤矿的扩建工程，主要是增添部分设备和扩大采煤工作面。因此，投资较少，收效很快。乌鲁木齐煤田两个矿井的扩建工程完工以后，生产量将等于现在的二点八倍。在新的大型煤矿没有建成以前，扩建的这些旧煤矿可以适当满足当地工业和铁路发展的需要。哈密地区的煤矿今年内就将向柴达木盆地供应大量的原煤。
    修建自动化的乳品厂
    在甘肃省甘南藏族自治州人民委员会所在地合作，正在兴建一座现代化的乳品厂。厂房、水电站、办公室、木工房等十六项工程目前正在紧张施工，今年第四季度即可安装机器。
    这座工厂的生产过程全部是自动化的。工厂的水电站，除供本厂以外，还可供给合作各机关和居民的用电。
    这个厂在兴建中，得到全国各地的技术和物质力量的支援。它的主要机械是上海、杭州、大连、重庆等地制造的。由东北调来了一批技术工人，并且在当地培养了一批藏族工人，他们都已经掌握了技术。这座工厂在明年第一季度投入生产后，将用汽车到各牧区收购牛奶。牧民们的牛奶因不易贮藏和外运，常常发酸腐坏的问题将得到解决。　（本栏新闻都是新华社稿）
