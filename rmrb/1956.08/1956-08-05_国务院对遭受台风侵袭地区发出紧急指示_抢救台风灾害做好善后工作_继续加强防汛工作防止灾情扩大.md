The State Council Issues Emergency Instructions to Areas Affected by Typhoon
Rescue Typhoon Disaster and Do a Good Job in Aftermath
Continue to Strengthen Flood Control Work to Prevent Disaster from Expanding

(Reported by this newspaper) The State Council issued an emergency instruction on August 4th, requiring areas affected by the typhoon to do a good job in rescue and aftermath work. The instruction stated: On the 2nd of this month, the typhoon landed at Xiangshan Port in Zhejiang Province, and most areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shanghai, as well as parts of Shandong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, were affected. The wind force at the center of the typhoon reached level 12 or above, and the wind force in areas within about 1,000 kilometers from the center reached level 8 or above. This typhoon was the largest since liberation in terms of wind force and scope. The areas where the typhoon arrived generally experienced heavy rain or rainstorms, causing river water levels to rise. Although all localities made relatively thorough arrangements for typhoon and disaster relief prevention, and the broad masses of people and cadres and workers actively participated in rescue efforts, greatly reducing the harm, the collapse of houses, casualties of people and livestock, and especially the damage to crops are still very serious. The disaster situation in the provinces already affected by the Huai River basin is even more serious, and many areas that were expected to have a good harvest have suffered new disasters.

The State Council is very concerned about this typhoon disaster and instructed all localities to earnestly do the following four tasks:

   1. Rescue work is urgent and brooks no delay. The injured should be helped with medical treatment, and the dead should be helped with burial; those still in dangerous areas should be transferred to safe locations; those whose houses have collapsed and are homeless should be temporarily accommodated in public residences or temporary shelters; and grain should be transferred from other areas to meet the urgent needs of areas without grain. In short, the masses affected by the disaster and experiencing difficulties should receive appropriate care in terms of medical treatment, housing, and food.

   2. In areas where circuits are interrupted, efforts should be made to repair them as soon as possible, especially to ensure that the power lines for factories are quickly unblocked to avoid affecting production.

   3. Flood control work must be strengthened. Sea dikes and dams destroyed by wind and waves should be repaired as soon as possible; areas with tense water situations should be closely monitored to prevent the disaster from continuing to expand and reduce crop losses. For crops that have already been damaged, those that can be rescued should be strengthened with field management to restore their growth; those that cannot be rescued should be replanted or converted to other crops in a timely manner.

   4. Areas affected by the typhoon should list rescue and aftermath work as one of the current central tasks; the Provincial People's Committee should organize responsible cadres to go down, on the one hand, to understand the situation, and at the same time, to discover problems and solve them on the spot. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the County People's Committee should vigorously help the district and township cadres to do a good job in the aftermath.

The State Council will also send working groups to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan provinces and Shanghai to understand the situation and help with the work.

    国务院对遭受台风侵袭地区发出紧急指示
    抢救台风灾害做好善后工作
    继续加强防汛工作防止灾情扩大
    本报讯　国务院八月四日发出紧急指示，要求遭受台风侵袭的地区做好抢救和善后工作。指示说：本月二日台风自浙江省的象山港登陆，浙江、江苏、安徽、河南、河北、上海的大部地区，以及山东、福建、江西、湖南、湖北的部分地区都遭受到侵袭。台风中心风力达十二级以上，中心外围约在一千公里以内的地区，风力也达八级以上。这次台风的风力大、范围广，是解放以来最大的一次。在以上台风到达的地区普遍降了大雨或暴雨，河流水位因而上涨。虽然各地对台风和救灾的防范准备，做了比较周密的部署，加以各地广大人民和职工干部的积极抢救，使危害大为减轻，但是房屋倒塌、人畜伤亡，特别农作物的损害仍是很严重的，淮河流域已经受灾的省份的灾情更为严重，许多可望丰收的地区又发生了新灾。
    国务院对此次台风灾害甚为关怀，指示中要求各地切实做好以下四项工作：
    一、抢救工作是急不容缓的。对伤者要帮助医疗，对死者要帮助安葬；对仍处在危险地区的要转移到安全地点；对房屋倒塌、无家可归的，应当暂时安置到公共住所或搭盖临时席棚，对无粮的地区要设法调运一部分粮食以应急需。总之，使受灾有困难的群众，在治病、住房、吃粮等方面得到适当照顾。
    二、电路中断的地区，要抓紧修复，特别是要使工厂动力的线路，迅速畅通，以免影响生产。
    三、防汛工作更要加强起来。对风浪摧毁的海塘堤坝，要尽早修复；水情紧张的地区，要严密看守，防止灾情继续扩大，以减少农作物的损失。已经受害的农作物，能够抢救的，要加强田间管理，使其恢复生长；不能抢救的，要及时补种、改种。
    四、遭台风地区，应当把抢救和善后工作列为当前的中心工作之一；省人民委员会要组织负责干部下去，一方面摸清情况，同时发现问题，就地解决。专署和县人民委员会更要大力帮助区乡干部做好善后工作。
    国务院并将派出工作组分赴浙江、江苏、安徽、河南四省和上海市了解情况、帮助工作。
