Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: According to Bangkok newspapers, the Burmese Ambassador to Thailand, U Pe Khin, once again spoke to the Bangkok press on August 22nd, denying the lie of so-called Chinese "aggression" against Burma. He pointed out that foreign news agencies saying that China was "invading" Burma was completely without factual basis.

U Pe Khin said that the Burmese people do not feel that China has any intention of "invading" Burma, and the Burmese government and the Burmese people firmly believe that China and Burma can adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and coexist peacefully with each other.

He pointed out that China and Burma are currently negotiating on the issue of the undefined Sino-Burmese border, and he believes that the border issue can be resolved through negotiations.

U Pe Khin returned to his post in Thailand on the 21st from Burma after returning home to report on his work. He said that he had participated in the Burmese government's discussion on this issue while in Burma, and the unanimous conclusion was that the problem was very small.

    缅甸驻泰国大使指出
    所谓中国“侵略”缅甸全是胡说
    缅甸政府和人民深信中缅两国坚守和平共处原则
    新华社27日讯　据曼谷报纸消息：缅甸驻泰国大使吴佩庆8月22日再一次向曼谷报界发表谈话，否认所谓中国“侵略”缅甸的谎言。他指出，外国通讯社说中国“侵略”缅甸，这是完全没有事实根据的。
    吴佩庆说，缅甸人民并没有感到中国有“侵略”缅甸的企图，缅甸政府和缅甸人民都深信，中缅两国是能坚守和平共处原则，彼此实行和平共处的。
    他指出，中缅两国目前正就中缅未定界问题进行谈判，相信经过谈判后边界问题是能够获得解决的。
    吴佩庆回国述职后在21日从缅甸回到泰国任所。他说，他在缅甸时曾经参加缅甸政府对这个问题的讨论，结果一致认为问题甚为微小。
