Regarding the handling of wage arrears owed to employees by private industrial and commercial enterprises during the private ownership period, and employee overdraws during the same period, after the full conversion of private industrial and commercial enterprises to joint state-private ownership, there are inconsistencies in understanding and practices across different regions. This newspaper inquired with relevant departments of the State Council and learned about the principles for handling the aforementioned two issues. These principles were already outlined in the State Council's "Instructions on Principles for Handling Debts and Other Issues When Private Enterprises Implement Joint State-Private Ownership" on March 30th of this year. The key points of this instruction are: Wage arrears owed to employees by the original private enterprises should, in principle, be repaid during the joint operation. If the enterprise's assets are already insufficient to cover its debts, or if there are very few remaining assets, repayment can be reduced or waived after labor-management consultation. If the determined wages cannot be paid off in cash, the joint state-private enterprise can repay them in installments. Wages owed during periods of work stoppage or reduced production can be reduced or waived after labor-management consultation.

Employee overdraws in enterprises should also, in principle, be repaid; however, the specific circumstances should be considered, and repayment can be reduced or waived after consultation for employees who are genuinely experiencing financial difficulties.

If enterprises in various regions have not addressed the above two issues, or if they have not been handled appropriately, they should be handled or rectified in accordance with the aforementioned instructions from the State Council.

    私营企业拖欠职工工资和职工长支问题
    国务院已经提出处理原则
    本报讯　私营工商业在私营时期拖欠职工工资和职工在私营时期的长支问题，在私营工商业全行业公私合营以后如何处理，各地在认识上和作法上不很一致。本报为此向国务院有关部门进行了解，获悉关于上述两个问题的处理原则。在今年3月30日国务院“关于私营企业实行公私合营的时候对债务等问题的处理原则的指示”中业已提出，这个指示的要点是：原私营企业拖欠职工的工资，原则上应该在合营的时候偿还，如果企业的资产已经不抵负债或者资财所余无几，经过劳资协商，可以少还或者不还。确定偿还的工资，如果不能用现款还清，可以转由公私合营企业代为分期偿还。停工减产期间所欠的工资，经劳资协商，可以少还或者不还。
    职工在企业中的长支，原则上也应该偿还；但是，要分别情况，对生活确实困难的职工，经过协商，可以少还或者不还。
    各地企业如果对上述两个问题没有处理，或者处理得不妥当的，都应该按照国务院上述的指示进行处理或者加以改正。
