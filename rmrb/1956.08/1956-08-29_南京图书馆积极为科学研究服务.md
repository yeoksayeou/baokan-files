The Nanjing Library Actively Serves Scientific Research

    (Our Nanjing News) The Nanjing Library is one of the key libraries in the country, with a collection of more than 2.4 million Chinese and foreign books. An average of more than 3,000 books and materials are consulted by readers every day.

    The Nanjing Library has seven specialized reference rooms, concentrating all relevant precious books and materials from the library's collection. Experts and scholars can often obtain first-class reference materials here. The library has 1,400 volumes of historical materials related to the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Since 1951, two quiet rooms have been specifically set aside for Professor Luo Ergang, a renowned expert in the history of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and other experts to conduct research. The "Local Chronicles" room has a wide and rich collection of books, which is rare in China. When the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was studying earthquake problems in basic construction, it used the books and materials in this room and gained a lot of knowledge. The Chinese Agricultural Heritage Research Office of Nanjing Agricultural College used local chronicles and other books to collect a large amount of data and compiled the reference books "Selected Materials of Chinese Agricultural Heritage" and "Abstracts of Chinese Agricultural Books." Shang Yanliu, an 83-year-old "Tanhua" (third place in the imperial examination), read nearly a hundred kinds of reference books in the Nanjing Library in order to complete a 200,000-word book "A Record of Qing Dynasty Imperial Examinations." In order to facilitate the needs of scientific research in various aspects, the library has set up mobile stations in factories to send books to workers; it has opened personal and organizational lending services to give greater play to the role of books.

    The micro-film reader in the Nanjing Library has films of various rare books. Experts and scholars in Nanjing can come to the library to read the rare books collected by the Beijing Library. At the same time, the Nanjing Library also has a number of transcribed copies, photographic copies of rare books, and unique books and materials. They accept commissions from researchers in other places to copy duplicates. They assisted researchers from the People's Literature Publishing House in Beijing who were studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" by copying books such as "Doghouse Talk on Red" and "Reading Red Xiaoshi"; when a professor from Shandong University was studying the works of Kong Shangren, the author of "The Peach Blossom Fan," they assisted in copying the entire "Lake and Sea Collection."

    In March of this year, the Nanjing Library, together with the libraries of 28 units including Nanjing universities and scientific research institutions, compiled a joint catalog of foreign periodicals and signed interlibrary loan contracts among the 28 libraries to promote interlibrary loans to meet the needs of experts and professors for academic research. In July, the library jointly organized a training class for library staff with the libraries of Nanjing University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, etc. Through the study, they initially mastered the basic knowledge of catalog bibliography, general reference books, Chinese and foreign book classification and cataloging, and data organization, so they can better serve scientific research.

    This year, through the international interlibrary loan relationship established between the Beijing Library and the Soviet National Lenin Library, scientific workers in Nanjing can borrow books from the Soviet Union through the Nanjing Library. At the same time, they are also actively replenishing foreign scientific and technical books and preparing to establish a scientific and technological book reading room and a local literature reading room. In order to facilitate expert research, they are also preparing to gradually establish eight individual research rooms. At present, the library is carrying out the sorting of 150,000 Chinese books, the collection of foreign periodical joint catalogs, and the compilation of special bibliographies of "Chinese Medicine" and "Ancient Chinese Agricultural Books."

    南京图书馆积极为科学研究服务
    本报南京讯　南京图书馆是全国重点图书馆之一，藏有中外书籍二百四十万册以上。每天平均有三千多册次的图书资料和读者见面。
    南京图书馆有七个专门资料室，集中了馆藏一切有关的珍贵图书资料。专家学者们常常能在这里得到第一等的参考材料。这个馆有一千四百册有关“太平天国”的历史资料，从1951年以来，就专门辟了两间僻静的房间，给研究“太平天国”历史的著名专家罗尔纲教授和其他专家们进行研究工作。“地方志”室藏书的广泛丰富是国内少有的。中国科学院地理研究所在研究基本建设中的地震问题时，利用这个室内的图书资料，得到不少收获。南京农学院中国农业遗产研究室，利用地方志和其他书籍，搜集了大批资料，编辑了“中国农业遗产资料选集”和“中国农书目提要”参考书。八十三岁的“探花”商衍鎏为了完成“清代科举考试述录”一部二十万字的著作，在南京图书馆阅读了近百种参考书。这个馆为了便利各方面科学研究的需要，在工厂设立了流动站，把图书送到工人手里；开办了个人和机关团体外借书籍工作，使图书发挥更大的作用。
    南京图书馆内设立的显微影片阅读机，备有各种善本书的胶卷，南京的专家学者来馆就可以阅读到北京图书馆收藏的善本书。同时，南京图书馆内也藏有不少传钞本、摄影善本、孤本等书籍资料，他们接受外地研究工作者的委托，钞录副本。他们曾应北京人民文学出版社的红楼梦研究工作者要求，协助钞录了“犬窝谈红”、“读红小识”等书；山东大学教授研究“桃花扇”作者孔尚任的著作，他们曾协助钞录了“湖海集”全部。
    今年三月，南京图书馆联合南京各高等学校和科学研究机关二十八个单位的图书馆，编制了外文期刊联合目录，同时，签订二十八个图书馆际互借合同，推动馆际互借，以满足专家教授学术研究的要求。七月，该馆和南京大学、南京工学院等图书馆联合举办了图书馆人员训练班，通过学习，使他们初步掌握了目录版本学，一般工具书，中外文图书分类编目及资料整理等基本知识，可以更好地为科学研究服务。
    今年，他们通过北京图书馆和苏联国立列宁图书馆建立的国际互借关系，南京的科学工作者可以通过南京图书馆借到苏联的图书。同时，他们还积极补购外文科学技术图书，筹备成立科学技术图书阅览室、地方文献阅览室。为了便利专家研究，他们还准备逐步建立八个个人研究室。目前，馆内正在进行十五万册中文图书的整理工作，外文报刊联合目录的集稿工作和“中国医药”、“中国古农书”专题书目的编印工作。
