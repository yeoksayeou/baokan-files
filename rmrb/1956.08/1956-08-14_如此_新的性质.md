Such "New Qualities"

The American bourgeois press is evidently very happy about the West German parliament's passage of the conscription law. They call it a "giant step" in the rearmament of West Germany by the Western countries.

However, American cold war strategists also know that the people of all countries will not forget the crimes of Hitler's Wehrmacht, and are wary of the revival of a militarist army. Therefore, they are making a big deal of publicizing that the 500,000-strong West German army to be established has so-called "new qualities."

The July 20th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" even listed a large number of arguments for this claim. It said that most of the equipment of the West German army will come from other countries, so "Germany will be completely dependent on its allies"; the West German army will become part of the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, so it must obey the decisions of the North Atlantic Organization, rather than accepting the decisions of the German command; at the same time, all officers must learn English, and officers must learn English and French.

In addition, the American press has also hyped that the West German army will not wear the uniforms and jackboots of Hitler's Wehrmacht, but will instead wear American Eisenhower jackets and leather shoes.

In the eyes of these American propaganda strategists, the West German army is dependent on American equipment and subsidies, accepts the orders of American generals in the North Atlantic Organization, wears American military uniforms, and speaks English, so people don't need to have any fears.

However, the people are not as easily fooled as those propaganda strategists think. The people will look at the facts. The vast majority of the leading figures in the West German army today are those old Hitler's generals. For example, Hausinger, the chairman of the Supreme Military Council, was the former chief of operations of Hitler's General Staff. He planned the attacks on the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, and was still clamoring "to attack whenever there is an opportunity" after the war. Speidel, the current head of the army, was the chief of staff of Hitler's Ninth Army Corps, which occupied France, and carried out the so-called "scorched earth" tactics in Ukraine. Also, Luger, the person in charge of the navy, is a "confidant" of Hitler's Field Marshal Rommel... Like these, the people still see the blood on their hands.

Dressing up the revived Wehrmacht in the guise of the American army will not diminish people's hatred of it. It is the American army that is now the object of hatred everywhere. From Iceland to Okinawa, people are shouting "Yankee Go Home," which is clear proof. Therefore, the new German army dressed up by the United States can only be doubly hated by the people.

"U.S. News & World Report" actually admits that the West German army is a mercenary army under American command, ready to serve as a vanguard.

As for the control of American generals, that can better illustrate the danger of the West German "new" army. People know where the world's largest war planning comes from today.

If this revived Hitler's Wehrmacht has anything new, it is precisely because it will be driven to serve not only the interests of the Ruhr magnates—as in the last war—but especially to sell their lives for the masters on the other side of the ocean. (Lin Sheng)

### 如此“新的性质”

    如此“新的性质”
    美国资产阶级报刊对于西德议会通过征兵法显然是很高兴的。它们称之为西方国家重新武装西德的一个“巨大的步骤”。
    但是，美国冷战策士们也知道各国人民不会忘掉希特勒国防军的罪行，而对重新复活一支军国主义军队心存戒惧。于是，它们大事宣传将要建立的五十万西德军队，具有所谓“新的性质”。
    七月二十日的“美国新闻与世界报道”还为这种说法列举了一大串论据。它说，西德军队的大部分装备将来自别的国家，这样“德国就将完全依赖于它的盟国”；西德军队将成为北大西洋公约组织在欧洲武装部队的一部分，因此它必须服从北大西洋组织的决定，而不是接受德国司令部的决定；同时，所有官员必须学英文，军官必须学英文和法文。
    此外，美国报刊还渲染过西德军队将不穿希特勒国防军的制服和高统靴，而换上美国的艾克式上衣和大皮鞋。
    在这些美国宣传策士看来，西德军队既依赖于美国的装备和津贴，又接受北大西洋组织中美国将军的命令，穿着美国军装，说着英语，那末，人们就大可不必有什么戒惧了。
    但是，人民并不像那些宣传策士所想的那样容易受骗。人民是会看事实的。目前担任西德军队领导人物的绝大多数都是那些旧日的希特勒的将军。如任最高军事委员会主席的豪辛格，就是过去希特勒参谋本部的作战处长。他曾策划过进攻荷兰、比利时、法国的计划，并在战后还在叫嚷“只要一有机会就进攻”。现任陆军首脑的斯派达尔，曾是占领法国的希特勒第九军团的参谋长，并在乌克兰执行过所谓“焦土”战术。还有，作为海军负责人的卢格，则是希特勒的元帅隆美尔的“亲信”……诸如此类，人民仍然看见这些人手上沾满着的血。
    把重新复活的国防军打扮成美国军队模样，不会减少人们对它的憎恨。正是美国军队现在到处成为人们憎恨的对象。从冰岛到冲绳岛，人民高呼“美国佬滚回去”，就是明证。因此，美国打扮的新国防军，只能受到人民双重的憎恨。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”实际上也承认：西德军队正是一支受美国指挥的、准备充作先锋的雇佣军。
    至于说到美国将军的控制，那更能够说明西德“新”军队的危险性。人们是知道的，现今世界上最大的战争策划出自什么地方。
    如果这支复活起来的希特勒国防军也有新的地方，那恰恰是因为它将被驱使来不只是为鲁尔巨头——像上次大战时一样——的利益服务，而且尤其是替大洋彼岸的老爷们卖命。　（林生）
