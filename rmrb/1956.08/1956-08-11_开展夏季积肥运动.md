    Launch a Summer Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign
    Cut Green Grass, Compost Green Manure
    500,000 Youths in Henan's Countryside Launch a Fertilizer Accumulation and Production Blitz
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 8th. Rural youths in Henan Province are launching a massive summer fertilizer accumulation campaign to "cut green grass and compost green manure."
    In agricultural production cooperatives throughout Henan, many youth fertilizer accumulation shock teams (groups) have recently been established at the cooperative or production team level. According to statistics from only forty-eight counties, including Anyang and Changge, 14,875 fertilizer accumulation shock teams (groups) have been organized, with over 500,000 youths participating. In nearly twenty days during early and mid-July, they composted over 3.977 billion catties of green manure and other fertilizers.
    The youths have shown great enthusiasm and achieved significant results in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, earning praise and support from within and outside the agricultural cooperatives. Members of the Youth Production Team of the Gongtong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangmiao Township, Changge County, proposed the slogan: "Every village sounds with activity, youths go to the battlefield, clear out the green grass, sweep up the soil and chaff." They led three other production teams to cut over 4,300 catties of green grass in one afternoon. In order to complete the cooperative's topdressing task on time, sixteen members of the Chongyi Township Youth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County, led by the Youth League Branch Secretary Niu Fengtong and Liu Aiyun, pressed over forty carts of green manure in one evening while carrying lanterns. The cooperative members composed a quick-rhythm clapper ballad to praise them, saying: "The youths are truly capable, accumulating green manure, leading the charge, guaranteeing increased production in the autumn."
    Based on the early arrival of the rainy season this year, the lush growth of green grass, and the favorable conditions for composting green manure during the hot summer, youth league organizations across Henan Province are widely mobilizing youths to carry out fertilizer accumulation activities such as "Fertilizer Accumulation Movement Month" or "Fertilizer Accumulation Movement Week."
    The fertilizer for next year's entire year depends on this summer's accumulation
    This newspaper reports that in order to prepare for next year's production, the Fusheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tonghua County, Jilin Province, has formulated a production plan for the fallow period. This plan includes six projects: agriculture, sideline occupations, fertilizer accumulation, and promoting early maturity of crops. The specific content of the fertilizer accumulation project is:
    During the fallow period, complete 80% of the annual fertilizer accumulation plan of 12,593 cartloads. The specific plan is to accumulate 9,673 cartloads of penned manure, soil manure, and fine manure; store 36,000 catties of saltpeter ash and stove soil; and prepare 800 cartloads of peat soil for granular fertilizer. All three cattle pens and three horse pens in the cooperative are regularly padded. Over 2,100 cartloads of green manure will be composted in three water pits and three hemp ponds. During this period, the cooperative will also make full use of all 140 toilets, 140 chicken coops, and over 200 kang beds to accumulate fine manure.
    We Only Realized the Shortage of Fertilizer After Doing the Accounting
    This newspaper reports that members of the Yixin Agricultural Cooperative in Caisang Township, Lin County, Henan, are enthusiastically launching a multi-pronged fertilizer accumulation campaign. As of July 28th, they had accumulated 9,000 dan of smoked fertilizer, collected over 3,800 catties of sheep droppings, swept up 16,000 catties of black ash soil from inside houses, penned 30,000 dan of manure, 6,000 dan of night soil, dug 30 manure pit bottoms, and cut 80,000 catties of artemisia, totaling over 4.7 million catties of various fertilizers.
    After the wheat harvest, the cooperative calculated the overall fertilizer shortage, and the result was that the autumn field topdressing alone was short 4 million catties of fertilizer. Based on this situation, the cooperative management committee made a decision to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign throughout the cooperative and formulated fertilizer accumulation contracting standards. The enthusiasm of the cooperative members was heightened, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated naturally increased.
    Returning Rice Straw to the Fields as Fertilizer Eliminates Worries About Late Rice Base Fertilizer
    This newspaper reports that various regions in Guangdong Province are adopting the method of returning rice straw to the fields to overcome the difficulty of insufficient base fertilizer for late rice. This method is very popular among farmers in fertilizer-deficient areas. More than 830 agricultural cooperatives and over 5.6 million mu of rice fields in the Foshan, Huiyang, and Gaoyao special districts have implemented high-stubble harvesting, and then plowed and composted the rice straw into fertilizer. In the first agricultural cooperative of Heshuikou Township, Zhongshan County, fields where rice straw is returned account for more than 90% of the cooperative's rice fields. Dongguan County is also specifically helping farmers improve their stove equipment, using other firewood instead of rice straw, so that more rice straw can be used as fertilizer.
    Rice straw contains abundant fertilizer, and applying four to five hundred catties per mu can meet the entire fertilizer needs of late rice, and it can also improve the soil. (Li Shaoqiu)
    Women are Busy Accumulating Fertilizer
    This newspaper reports that the management committee of the Xinmin No. 1 Cooperative in Gaojiayao Township, Lishu County, Jilin Province, called on its members to not return empty-handed from the fields, and to cut a bundle of grass each day for composting green manure. The cooperative also studied a method to record the quantity and quality of the manure accumulated by each household in a small notebook when the fertilizer accumulation team goes to each team to collect manure. With this in mind, the members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer has increased. More than 20 female members of the third production team took advantage of the rainy days to dig three fertilizer composting pits, composted 250 bundles of green grass, and padded 20 carts of soil. Hu Guizhi's family has already accumulated about 3,000 catties of human waste, pig, chicken manure, and small ash.

    开展夏季积肥运动
    割青草　沤绿肥
    河南农村五十万青年突击积肥造肥
    新华社郑州8日电　河南省农村青年正在开展一个声势浩大的“割青草、沤绿肥”的夏季积肥运动。
    河南省各地农业生产合作社里最近都以社或生产队为单位，建立了许多青年积肥突击队（组）。仅据安阳、长葛等四十八个县的部分乡统计，就组织了积肥突击队（组）一万四千八百七十五个，参加的青年在五十万人以上。他们在七月上旬和中旬近二十天的时间内，共压沤绿肥和其他肥料三十九亿七千多万斤。
    青年们在积肥运动中劲头足，成绩大，受到农业社内和社外的赞扬和支持。长葛县双庙乡共同农业生产合作社的青年生产队队员提出
  “村村家伙响，青年上战场，青草要铲净，土糠要扫光”的口号，他们带动其他三个生产队在一个中午就割青草四千三百多斤。安阳县崇义乡青年农业生产合作社为了按时完成全社追肥任务，在青年团支部书记牛凤桐、刘爱云的带领下，十六个队员在晚上提着灯笼一次就压绿肥四十多车。社员们编了快板赞扬他们说：“青年人，可真行，积绿肥，打先锋，秋季增产有保证。”
    河南省各地青年团的组织，根据今年雨季提前、青草生长茂盛、夏季天热是沤压绿肥的有利时机等情况，正在广泛动员青年开展“积肥运动月”或“积肥运动周”等积肥活动。
    明年一年施的肥料全靠今年夏季攒积
    本报讯　吉林省通化县复盛农业生产合作社为了给明年生产作好准备，已制定了挂锄期间的生产计划。这个计划包括农业、副业、积肥、促使作物早熟等六个项目，积肥项目的具体内容是：
    在挂锄期间，完成全年积肥计划12，593车的80％。具体计划是过圈粪、土粪和细粪9，673车，存硝灰、炕洞土36，000斤，准备好800车作颗粒肥料用的草炭土。全社的三个牛圈，三个马圈都定期垫起。在三个水坑和三个麻泡子里沤绿肥二千一百多车。在此期间并充分利用全社的一百四十个厕所、一百四十个鸡架和二百多铺炕积攒细肥。
    算了账才知肥料少
    本报讯　河南林县采桑乡一心农业社的社员，正热火朝天地展开了多头多路的积肥运动。截至七月二十八日，共熏肥九千担，拾羊粪蛋三千八百多斤，扫屋内黑灰土一万六千斤，圈肥三万担，大粪六千担，挖粪坑底三十个，割蒿八万斤，共计积各种肥料四百七十多万斤。
    这个社麦收后，就把全社缺肥账算了一下，算的结果，只秋田追肥一项就缺肥四百万斤。社管理委员会根据这一情况作出全社开展积肥运动的决定和制定积肥包工标准。社员群众的积肥情绪高了，积肥的数量自然就增加了。
    稻秆回田作肥料晚稻基肥不发愁
    本报讯　广东省各地正在采取稻秆回田的办法来克服晚稻基肥不足的困难。这个办法很受缺肥地区农民的欢迎。佛山、惠阳和高要专区已有八百三十多个农业社，五百六十多万亩稻田实行了高茬割禾，然后把稻秆犁翻沤烂作肥。中山县合水口乡第一农业社，实行稻秆回田的田占全社稻田90％以上。东莞县还具体帮助农民改善炉灶设备，用其他柴草代替稻秆，以便有更多的稻秆用做肥料。
    稻秆含有丰富的肥份，每亩施下四、五百斤就能满足晚稻的全期需肥，并且还可改良土壤。（李少球）
    妇女积肥忙
    本报讯　吉林省梨树县高家窑乡新民一社管理委员会，号召社员下地回来不空手，每人一天割一捆草沤绿肥。社里还研究一个办法，就是在积肥小组到各队去起粪的时候，把各家积的粪肥数量、质量都记在小本子上。社员们心里有底了，积肥劲头就高了。第三生产队的二十多名妇女社员，利用下雨天挖了三个沤肥坑，沤了二百五十捆青草，垫了二十车土。社员胡桂芝家攒的人粪尿、猪、鸡粪和小灰，已经有三千斤左右了。
