The First National Music Week has launched academic discussion activities. Beginning on the 4th, the music workers participating in Music Week began holding symposiums in five groups: opera creation, vocal performance, folk, classical music, traditional opera music, and lyric writing. These topical discussions aroused great interest among professional workers in various fields. Everyone broadly exchanged opinions on the current situation and existing problems, as well as how to implement the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy in all departments of musical art. These topical discussions will continue and will be explored in more depth.

In addition, the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music will begin exhibiting the Chinese Music Historical Materials Exhibition in conjunction with the First National Music Week, starting on the 5th. The exhibition has five display rooms: Chinese Music Historical Materials Display Room; National Musical Instrument Display Room; Chinese Folk Music Materials Display Room; Nie Er Memorial Room; and Xian Xinghai Memorial Room. Through these five exhibition rooms, one can see that China has a long history and a rich and diverse national musical heritage.
