    Kunming, August 21st (by our newspaper's reporter) — The situation in some areas of Yunnan Province where work related to ethnic minorities in mountainous regions was neglected has seen considerable improvement. The CPC Qujing, Zhaotong, and Wenshan Prefectural Committees are currently taking measures based on the different characteristics and demands of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas to provide special assistance and care, so as to enable them to rapidly shake off their backward conditions.
    In the seventeen counties of Qujing Prefecture, twenty-seven ethnic groups reside (including various branches of the Yi people), accounting for 9.3% of the total population of the prefecture. After the implementation of agricultural cooperativization, peasant households joining cooperatives have accounted for 90% of the total number of households in the local area. In recent years, through the efforts of all parties, various ethnic minorities in mountainous areas have changed their original backward conditions to varying degrees.
    However, in the course of this work, there was a lack of due assistance and consideration for the special demands and difficulties of ethnic minorities. In some areas, district and township cadres had a rigid and coercive style, violating the special customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Production plans and labor arrangements of some agricultural cooperatives, and the handling of relationships between cooperatives and their members, generally neglected the characteristics of mountainous areas. Insufficient consideration was given to ethnic specialties in the arrangement of labor within the cooperatives, and there were unreasonable phenomena in labor quotas. There were large disparities in labor remuneration and work points among equal labor forces of various ethnic groups. In some areas of Zhaotong Prefecture, insufficient consideration was given to the Miao people in mountainous areas in economic work such as loans and trade. Insufficient work has also been done in developing Party and League members and promoting ethnic minority cadres. In Zhongxing Township, Daguan County, the Sixth Group is a Miao village, and only three League members have been developed in recent years. The demand of the Miao people for regional autonomy has also not been addressed in a timely manner.
    In order to meet the different demands and characteristics of the people of all ethnic groups, Qujing, Songming, Rongfeng, Zhaotong, Yongshan, Wenshan, Qiubei and other regions have strengthened cadre education based on the problems found in a comprehensive inspection of the work in ethnic minority areas. Cadres in all areas are required to continue to overcome Han chauvinist ideas ideologically, change their leadership style, respect the special customs and habits of ethnic minorities, and earnestly care about the demands of ethnic minorities in mountainous and high-altitude mountainous areas. Yongshan County is vigorously developing animal husbandry based on the characteristics of mountainous areas. It is also establishing a demonstration farm in Malan Township, selecting and allocating fine breeds of livestock. The Mina Agricultural Cooperative in Qiubei County is helping Miao and Tu people who earn fewer work points to improve their production techniques, develop diversified operations, promote the specialties of Miao and Tu members, and strive for more income by working more. Some cooperatives in the Qujing area are making every effort to promote the skills of members of various ethnic groups, helping and encouraging them to improve farming techniques, improve tools, gradually fix耕地耕地, and change the habit of not applying or applying little fertilizer. The Zhaotong Prefecture plans to establish one Miao middle school and ten primary schools. In addition to establishing health centers in all eighty-eight districts of the prefecture, it will establish venereal disease prevention and treatment centers and groups in Yongshan, Yanjin, Qiaojia, Yiliang and other counties, requiring the basic elimination of venereal diseases among the Miao people by 1962.
    In order to further strengthen the work in ethnic minority areas, Lunan, Shizong, Luxi, Xundian, Yongshan, Yanjin, Zhenxiong, Weixin and other counties, in addition to assigning dedicated personnel among the county party committee members to be responsible for the specific leadership of mountainous and high-altitude mountainous areas, some counties have also established mountainous area work committees.

    中共云南曲靖地委等采取措施改进山区工作
    帮助各兄弟民族迅速摆脱落后状况
    本报昆明21日电　云南省某些地区忽视山区少数民族工作的情况已有不少改进。中共曲靖、昭通、文山等地委，目前正在根据山区少数民族不同的特点和要求，采取措施，给以特殊的帮助和照顾，使他们迅速摆脱落后状况。
    曲靖专区十七个县内，居住着二十七个民族（包括彝族各支系），占全区总人口的9.3％，在实行农业合作化以后，入社农户已占当地总户数的90％。几年来，经过各方面的努力，山区各少数民族在不同程度上改变了原有的落后面貌。
    但是，在这个工作的过程中，对于少数民族中特殊的要求和困难，缺少应有的帮助和照顾，有些地区的区、乡干部作风生硬、强迫命令，违犯了少数民族特殊的风俗习惯。有的农业社的生产规划劳力安排和处理社和社员的关系上，普遍地忽略了山区特点。在社内劳力安排上照顾民族特长不够，劳动定额存在不合理现象，各族同等劳动力之间，劳动所得劳动工分悬殊很大。昭通专区有些地区对山区苗族人民在贷款、贸易等经济工作中照顾不够。在发展党、团员和提拔民族干部方面作的也很不够。大关县中兴乡六大组是苗族住的寨子，几年来只发展了三个团员。对于苗族人民要求的区域自治也没有及时注意解决。
    为了满足各族人民不同的要求和特点，曲靖、嵩明、榕峰、昭通、永善、文山、丘北等地区，根据对少数民族地区工作全面检查出来的问题，加强了干部教育。要求各地干部从思想上继续克服大民族主义思想，转变领导作风，尊重少数民族特殊的风俗习惯，切实关心山区和高寒山区少数民族的要求。永善县根据山区的特点，大力发展畜牧业。并在马兰乡建立一个示范性的农场，选配优良畜种。丘北县密纳农业社帮助得工分少的苗、土族社员提高生产技术，发展多种经营，发扬苗、土族社员的专长，作到多出工，争取更多的收入。曲靖地区有的社尽量发扬各族社员一技之长，帮助和鼓励他们改良耕作技术，改进工具，逐步固定耕地，改变不施肥和少施肥的习惯。昭通专区计划成立一所苗族中学、十所小学，除全区八十八个区设立卫生所外，在永善、盐津、巧家、彝良等县设立性病防治所和组，要求到1962年基本上消除苗族中的性病。
    为了进一步加强少数民族地区的工作，路南、师宗、泸西、寻甸、永善、盐津、镇雄、威信等县，除了在县委委员中确定专人负责山区和高寒山区的具体领导之外，有的县还建立了山区工作委员会。
