Xinhua News Agency, August 26th—Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, spoke today at the Fourth Beijing Municipal Youth League Congress on several issues in the current work of the Youth League.

In his speech, Hu Yaobang first called on young people to continue to work hard for the socialist construction of the motherland. He said that at present, our country's economy and culture are very backward. If we do not strive to overcome this phenomenon, it will be extremely difficult to build socialism, and it will prevent us from advancing economically by leaps and bounds. Therefore, we must work hard, rely on our own efforts, strive for foreign aid, and catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in a few decades. This is our general direction.

Hu Yaobang then expressed his opinions on four issues in the current work of the Youth League. He said that the Youth League should continue to strengthen the education of young people in communist ideology and morality. In recent years, the Youth League has made great achievements in this regard. Under the leadership of the Party, the Youth League has conducted education among young people on class struggle, patriotism, internationalism, national unity, love of labor, adherence to discipline, and the need for good morals. All of this has been done correctly. But there are also shortcomings. For example, in some places, discipline is handled too mechanically, with discipline everywhere. There are too many meetings. Ideological struggle, criticism and self-criticism are necessary and correct, but some people randomly label others and do not reason, which is unacceptable.

Second, we must continue to organize young people to march towards culture and science. He said that science is diverse. The work of each department, such as youth, trade unions, and Party affairs, is also science, and there should be experts in these departments. At the same time, everyone's level and working conditions are different. Therefore, the march towards science should be based on specific plans according to different situations, with some learning culture, some learning technology, some improving their professional skills, and some studying Marxism-Leninism.

Third, we must continue to carry out independent activities for building socialism. In the past, the Youth League independently did a lot of work, but the shortcoming was insufficient planning, so it only focused on quantity and not quality, being tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and spreading too thin. We must continue to carry out these activities in the future.

Fourth, continue to strengthen the organizational construction of the League and improve the grassroots level of the League. At present, there are two incorrect views on the Youth League: one is that the Youth League is almost the same as the Party, and the other is that the Youth League is a mass organization. In fact, the Youth League should be an advanced, but also somewhat mass-based, organization of youth close to the Party. Therefore, too many Youth League members cannot be developed too casually. A certain discipline, a certain organizational life, frequent criticism and self-criticism, frequent ideological education, and periodic organizational rectification are needed to maintain the advanced nature of our Youth League.

The congress began on the 22nd. The congress will discuss and determine the current tasks of the Beijing Municipal League organization, elect a new Municipal League Committee, and elect delegates to the Third National Congress of the League. Attending the congress are 924 outstanding League members and League workers from all fronts in Beijing.

    在北京市青年团代表大会上
    胡耀邦谈目前青年团的工作
    据新华社26日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦，今天在青年团北京市第四次代表大会上就目前青年团工作中的几个问题讲了话。
    胡耀邦在讲话中首先号召青年们要为了祖国的社会主义建设而继续艰苦奋斗。他说，目前我国的经济、文化都很落后。我们不努力克服这一现象，要建成社会主义将有极大的困难，将使我们经济上不能大踏步前进。因此，我们必须努力干，自力更生，争取外援，在几十年内赶上并超过资本主义最发达的国家，这就是我们总的方向。
    胡耀邦接着对目前青年团工作中的四个问题发表了意见。他说，青年团在目前应当继续加强对青年共产主义的思想品质的教育。几年来青年团在这方面有很大成绩，青年团在党的领导下对青年进行了阶级斗争、爱国主义、国际主义、民族团结以及爱劳动、守纪律、要有美好道德等教育，这些进行得都很正确。但是也有缺点，如有的地方对纪律搞得太机械，什么地方都有纪律。开会多了一点。思想斗争、批评与自我批评是要的、对的，但是有的人却乱扣帽子，不讲道理，这就要不得了。
    第二，要继续组织青年向文化科学进军，他说，科学是多种多样的，青年、工会、党务等每一部门业务也都是科学，这些部门里也应该有专家。同时，每个人水平、工作条件又不同，因此，向科学进军要根据不同情况订出具体规划，有的学文化，有的学技术，有的提高业务，有的学习马列主义。
    第三，要继续进行建设社会主义的独立活动。以前青年团独立地做了许多工作，缺点是计划性不足，因此只顾数量不顾质量，前紧后松，铺得太大。今后要继续开展这些活动。
    第四，继续加强团的组织建设，把团的基层搞好。目前对青年团有两种不对的看法，一种以为青年团和党差不多，一种以为青年团是群众团体。实际上，青年团应该是接近党的青年中先进的但也有一定数量群众性的组织。因此青年团员不能发展得太多太滥，需要一定纪律，一定的组织生活，经常的批评与自我批评，经常进行思想教育，定期进行组织整顿，以保持我们青年团的先进性。
    这次代表大会是在22日开始的，代表大会将讨论并确定北京市团组织当前的工作任务，选举新的团市委和出席团的第三次全国代表大会的代表。出席这次大会的有来自北京市各个战线上的优秀团员和团的工作人员共九百二十四人。
