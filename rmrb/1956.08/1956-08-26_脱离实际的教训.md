	Lessons from Disconnecting from Reality
	Ji Jingfeng
	Beginning in March of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and Traffic Management Department implemented a "reform" in the suburbs to eliminate backward modes of transportation. The specifics were: bicycles were no longer allowed to carry passengers or goods on suburban roads, farmers' trailers were not allowed to enter the urban area, small wooden boats were not allowed to operate on the Huangpu River, and so on. The rationale was that these backward modes of transportation were inefficient, unsafe, and unsightly in a modern industrial city.
	However, the results of this reform were contrary to expectations. Not only was the traffic order in the suburbs of Shanghai no better than before, but it was even more inconvenient for the local people. Cadres and masses who used to ride bicycles now had to walk; farmers who used to use trailers to haul things had to carry them on their shoulders; those who used to transport goods on the Huangpu River by small wooden boats now had to rely on the only ferry. Workers living in the suburbs had to squeeze onto buses to go to and from work. There were too many people and not enough buses. Some waited for four or five buses without being able to get on, and they were so anxious about being late for work that they stopped cars on the road and refused to let them pass. In the past, supply and marketing cooperatives took advantage of the many rivers in the suburbs, hiring one or two small wooden boats to transport goods to the village outlets in two days. Now they have to use large ships with a load capacity of more than ten tons to transport a few tons of goods. Because the rivers are narrow and the ships are large, they have to wait for the high tide to sail, which takes five days to transport the goods to the village outlets. Moreover, these large ships are in danger of being damaged when sailing in small rivers.
	The elimination of so-called "backward modes of transportation" disrupted the original urban-rural transportation links and affected the lives of urban and rural people. In the past, there were more than thirty small wooden boats on the Huangpu River transporting people and vegetables day and night. Now that small wooden boats are prohibited, especially after the city ferry stops at 10 p.m., vendors cannot cross the Huangpu River to buy vegetables, and farmers cannot cross the Huangpu River to sell vegetables. If they wait until the ferry opens at 4 a.m. to cross the Huangpu River to buy and sell vegetables, they will miss the early vegetable market. Many vendors had to cross the Huangpu River before 10 p.m. on the first day to buy vegetables in the suburbs, and then wait for the ferry to open the next day to transport them to the urban area. However, there are especially many people queuing for the first boat in the morning. Every morning, there are more than 100 vegetable vendors queuing at the Ningguo Road West Ferry, as well as hundreds of workers going to work. The workers, fearing they would be late for work, demanded to cross first, while the vegetable vendors also emphasized the importance of supplying vegetables to the citizens and were unwilling to fall behind. As a result, those who did not squeeze onto the boat protested and refused to let the boat leave. Originally, there was a boat every fifteen minutes, but sometimes, due to the noise and commotion, the boat had not left the shore after half an hour. In the past, suburban farmers mainly relied on trailers and bicycles to transport vegetables to the city. A trailer could carry 500 jin, and a bicycle could carry 200-300 jin. Now, they can only carry more than 100 jin by manpower every day. Large quantities of vegetables cannot be transported out and are piling up and rotting, while the retail vegetable market is experiencing a vegetable shortage.
	Shanghai is a modern industrial city, and it should gradually replace backward modes of transportation with modern ones; however, it must not be divorced from the current reality and make decisions casually. There are more than 2,600 bicycles in the suburbs of Shanghai that make a living by transporting passengers and goods, and more than 5,000 two-wheeled trailers, three-wheeled trucks, and rubber-tired carts. In the three townships of Liu Li, Gaoqiao, and Yangjing in the eastern suburbs alone, there are 190 small wooden boats. These so-called backward modes of transportation play a significant role in urban and rural production and sales transportation today, and before modern transportation tools replace them, they are still more advanced than "walking on two feet and carrying burdens on two shoulders." These modes of transportation have gradually formed in the needs of people's production and life for hundreds of years. We should not adopt a crude attitude to simply eliminate them, and the result of the elimination has only made Shanghai, which is currently facing a serious shortage of transportation capacity, feel particularly difficult.
	The harmful consequences of blindly eliminating backward modes of transportation were so serious that recently, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Traffic Department had to decide to revise this method: bicycles are allowed to carry people and goods in the suburbs, and they are preparing to issue licenses to farmers' trailers. However, this is still a lesson worth remembering. How much loss can disconnecting from reality bring to work!

    脱离实际的教训
    吉景峰
    上海市公安局和交通管理部门从今年三月起，在郊区实行了一项取缔落后交通运输工具的“改革”。它的具体内容是：不准自行车再在郊区道路上携带客人和货物，农民的拖车不准进入市区，小木船不准在黄浦江里行驶等等。理由是这些落后的交通工具效率低，不安全，在近代工业城市里来往也不雅观。
    但是这项改革的结果事与愿违，上海郊区的交通秩序不但不比过去好，对当地人民反而更加不方便了。原来搭自行车代步的干部和群众，只好用两条腿跑路；原来用拖车拉东西的农民只好用两肩挑；原来用小木船在黄浦江上运东西的，现在只能依靠唯一的轮渡。家在郊区的工人上下班只好挤公共汽车，人多汽车少，有的等了四、五班汽车还挤不上去，眼看误了上工时间，就急得拦住马路上的汽车不让开走。供销社过去利用郊区河道多的特点，雇一两只小木船花两天工夫，就可以把货物运到各乡的门市部。现在只好用载重十几吨的大船运几吨货。因河道狭小，船身庞大，必须等大潮水来时才能行船，这样就得花五天时间才能把货物运到各乡门市部；何况这些大船在小河道行驶还有被碰坏船身的危险。
    取缔所谓“落后交通工具”的结果，使原有的城乡交通联系受到破坏，影响了城乡人民的生活。以前黄浦江上有三十几只小木船夜以继日地在这里渡人运菜，现在小木船被禁止通行了，特别是市轮渡在晚上十时停航后，小贩不能过黄浦江买菜，农民不能过黄浦江卖菜，如果等到早上四点钟轮渡开航后再过黄浦江去买菜卖菜，就赶不上早菜市场了。许多小贩只好在第一天晚上十时前渡过黄浦江，到郊区把菜买好，等第二天轮渡开来再往市区运。可是早上第一班船排队的人特别多。宁国路西渡口每天早上排队的菜贩都有一百多人，还有好几百上工去的工人。工人怕误了上工时间要求先过渡，菜贩也强调供应市民的蔬菜重要不愿落在后面，于是没有挤上船的人，吵着不让船开。本来是十五分钟一班，有时因吵吵闹闹，半个钟头船还没有离开岸。过去郊区农民往城市运菜，主要靠拖车和自行车，一部拖车可装五百斤，一辆自行车也可装二、三百斤，现在用人力每天只能挑一百多斤，大批蔬菜运不出去而积压和霉烂；蔬菜零售市场上却在闹菜荒。
    上海是一个现代化的工业城市，应该逐步地以现代化的交通工具代替落后交通工具；但是绝不能脱离当前的实际情况，随便作出决定。上海郊区靠运客运货谋生的自行车有两千六百多辆，两轮拖车、三轮货车和胶皮塌车有五千多辆，仅东郊区六里、高桥、洋泾三个乡镇就有小木船一百九十条。这些所谓落后的运输工具今天在城乡产销运输方面起着不小的作用，而且在现代化交通运输工具没有代替它以前，终究比“两脚走路、两肩挑担”先进得多。这些交通工具是在几百年来人民生产和生活需要中逐渐形成的，我们不应当采取粗暴的态度简单地加以取缔，而取缔的结果恰恰使目前运输力严重不足的上海格外感到困难。
    盲目取缔落后交通工具的恶果那么严重，最近，上海市公安局交通处不得不决定修正这个办法：准许自行车在郊区带人带货，并准备给郊区农民的拖车发牌照。但是，这仍然是个值得记取的教训，脱离实际会给工作带来多大的损失呵！
