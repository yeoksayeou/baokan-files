Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th – According to an Agence France-Presse report from Saigon on the 6th, well-informed sources said that the French government has notified the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference that it is willing to send representatives to participate in the Joint Ceasefire Commission in the demilitarized zone at the 17th parallel to help implement the Vietnam ceasefire agreement.

The French government expressed this attitude in a recent note to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The Soviet and British governments wrote to the French government on May 8, requesting France to continue to play a mediatory role in maintaining the Vietnam ceasefire.

Since the withdrawal of French armed forces from South Vietnam at the end of April this year, the French Federal Forces Delegation has refused to attend the Joint Ceasefire Commission in the demilitarized zone. During this period, incidents of the South Vietnamese authorities violating the demilitarized zone have increased significantly.

    法政府愿意重新参加越南停战委员会
    新华社河内7日电　据法新社六日从西贡报道，消息灵通人士说，法国政府已经通知日内瓦会议的两位主席，表示它愿意派代表参加在十七度线的非军事区联合停战委员会，以帮助实施越南停战协定。
    法国政府是在新近交给日内瓦会议两位主席的照会中表示了这个态度的。苏联和英国政府在五月八日曾经写信给法国政府，要求法国在维持越南停战的工作中继续起斡旋的作用。
    自从法国武装部队在今年四月底撤离南越以来，法国联邦部队代表团即拒绝出席非军事区的联合停战委员会。在这个期间，南越当局侵犯非军事区的事件有显著的增加。
