    Introduction to Mars
    Mars – Closest to Earth This Year
    Recently, Mars has become the most noticeable star in the night sky. Around 8 p.m., people can see it emitting a fiery red glow in the southeastern sky.
    Mars, like Earth, is one of the nine major planets in the solar system and orbits the sun. In terms of distance from the sun, Earth is third and Mars is fourth, so Mars' orbit is larger than Earth's. Therefore, it takes longer to orbit the sun. Its year is approximately equal to two Earth years. Because of this, Earth and Mars approach each other approximately every two years. This is when Earth is exactly between the sun and Mars, which is called "opposition." That is to say, the opposition of Mars occurs on average every two years. However, Mars' orbit is elliptical, meaning it is more flattened. When it reaches the side of the flattened orbit closer to the sun, it is called perihelion; when it reaches the other side, it is called aphelion. At the same time, the distance between Mars and Earth varies greatly, reaching up to 400 million kilometers at its farthest. When in opposition, it is closer to Earth, with the distance being less than 100 million kilometers. If Mars is near its perihelion and happens to be in opposition, it will be closest to Earth, which is called a great opposition; this occurs on average every fifteen or seventeen years, always between July and September. This year, Mars passes its perihelion on August 22nd and is in great opposition on September 11th. The date of closest approach to Earth is September 7th, when it will be only 56 million kilometers away. At this time, Mars is also brighter than at any other time, sixty to seventy times brighter than usual. For one or two months around September 7th, it can be seen almost all night long, making it a good opportunity to observe Mars.
    Earth's Sister Planet
    Mars is smaller than Earth, with a diameter of only 6,900 kilometers, half the diameter of Earth. Its volume is also smaller, with roughly seven Mars equaling one Earth. Mars has many similarities to Earth, so some say Mars and Earth are like sister planets. Earth has revolution and rotation, and so does Mars. Mars rotates once in 24 hours and 37 minutes, half an hour longer than Earth's rotation. Mars orbits the sun in about 687 days, almost equivalent to two Earth years. Also, the axis of rotation of Mars is inclined at 65 degrees to the ecliptic plane, similar to the Earth's axis of rotation, which is inclined at 66.5 degrees to the ecliptic plane. Therefore, Mars also travels at an angle, with yearly seasonal changes, just like Earth. As for the gravity on the surface of Mars, it is smaller than that of Earth, only one-third.
    Mars receives two and a half times less sunlight than Earth, and it is colder on Mars than on Earth. In winter, the temperature is between minus 60 and minus 80 degrees Celsius, and in summer, it is between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius above zero. Near the north and south poles, like on Earth, the sun sometimes does not set below the horizon.
    In addition, Mars has two satellites, or two moons.
    Some Conditions on Mars
    The Earth's surface has a thick atmosphere, and the surface of Mars is also surrounded by an atmosphere, but it is thinner than Earth's. Clouds and fog can be seen on Mars through a telescope. The most noticeable are the two white patches at the north and south poles of Mars, which look like ice and snow on Earth. These are the polar caps. The polar caps grow larger in winter and gradually shrink in spring, as if the ice and snow are melting due to warmer weather. Through a telescope, you can also see some black stripes on Mars. In the past, some people thought these were canals dug by Martians; according to current scientific research, these are likely to be cracks on Mars. We can also see spots on Mars, some reddish-orange, others blue and dark green. The color of some spots changes with the seasons: they are grayish-brown in winter; after spring comes, the color gradually deepens, and in autumn, they become light gray again. Soviet astronomers have studied these interesting phenomena and believe that the reddish-orange spots are deserts, and the blue and green spots are plants on Mars, which change color with the seasons, just like plants on Earth.
      Is there life on Mars?
    As everyone knows, life must have certain conditions to exist: temperature, air, and water. There is air on Mars, but it is much thinner than on Earth, about the same as the air at an altitude of 15 kilometers above Earth. The air is mostly carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen, only 15% of the oxygen on Earth. The temperature has already been mentioned above. As for water, we can see ice and snow on the polar caps through a telescope, so there is naturally water. Based on these conditions, it is very likely that there is life on Mars. Academician Tikhov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has been studying Mars for many years, using spectral analysis to study various types of plants on Earth, comparing these types with spectral observation data of spots on Mars. He believes that the plants on Mars should be similar to moss plants in the polar regions or on high mountains and plateaus on Earth. A new discipline called astrobotany has been established, and an astrobotany research laboratory has been built at the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, which has opened up new avenues for studying whether there is life in space.
    Many scientists believe that there are plants on Mars; since there are plants, there may well be animals. But whether this can become a reality remains to be seen in future research, because there is not enough evidence and material yet, so we cannot be sure. At the same time, some scholars oppose this view.
    The Significance of Mars Observation
    Mars' orbit is outside Earth's orbit. From Earth, its direction of movement in the sky is very complex. Sometimes it moves from west to east, sometimes from east to west, and sometimes it seems to stop moving. Our ancestors called Mars "荧惑" (Yinghuo, "the bewildering fire star"), which can be said to be due to this confusing movement.
    We know that when the Polish astronomer Copernicus (1473-1543) discovered the heliocentric theory, people did not understand the orbits of planets revolving around the sun. It was not until the German astronomer Kepler (1571-1630) discovered the three laws of planetary motion that this problem was solved. Kepler's great discovery was based on the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's (1546-1601) faithful observations of Mars for more than 30 years. From this, we can know that past observations of Mars have had great significance.
    The fact that plants survive on Mars has almost been confirmed. This once again confirms the Marxist-Leninist philosophical view of life: that life is a normal process of material development, and as long as there are suitable conditions, life can always occur.
    This approach of Mars to Earth is a good opportunity for us to observe Mars. Unfortunately, the observatory of the Beijing Planetarium has not yet been completed, and we cannot use a 13-centimeter telescope for observation, but only a few small telescopes for the public to observe.

    火星介绍
    火星——今年最接近地球
    近来，火星已经成为夜空中最引人注意的星球，大约在晚上八点钟左右，人们在天空的东南边可以看到它放出红火色的光芒。
    火星和地球一样，是太阳系中九大行星之一，也是围绕太阳运行的。从离开太阳的远近来说，地球是第三，火星是第四，所以火星的轨道比地球的轨道为大。因此，绕太阳一周要费更长的时间，它的一年约等于地球的两年；因为这样，每隔两年，地球和火星就要接近一次。这时候，地球刚好在太阳和火星的中间，就叫做“冲”；也就是说，火星冲日平均约隔两年发生一次。但是，火星的轨道是椭圆，也就是说比较扁圆的；当它走到扁圆轨道比较近太阳这一头时，叫做过近日点，当走到另一头时，叫做过远日点。同时火星离地球的距离变化很大，最远时可以达到四万万公里；当冲的时候，就比较接近地球了，这时距离就只在一万万公里以内。如果，火星在过近日点附近，恰好为冲的时候，那它将最接近地球，这叫做大冲；平均每隔十五年或十七年才发生一次，而且总是在7月和9月之间。像今年火星在8月22日过近日点，在9月11日大冲，而最接近地球的日期，则在9月7日，这时离地球只有五千六百万公里。这时候火星也比它任何时候都亮，比它平常时候亮到六七十倍。在9月7日前后各一、二个月里，几乎整个晚上都可见到它，这是我们看火星的好机会。
    地球的姐妹星
    火星比地球小，它的直径只有六千九百公里，是地球直径的一半；体积亦比地球小，差不多要七个火星才抵得上一个地球。火星有许多情况和地球相像，所以有人说火星和地球好像是姐妹星。地球有公转和自转，火星亦有。火星自转一周是二十四时三十七分，比地球自转一周多半个钟头。火星绕太阳一周约是六百八十七天，差不多相当于地球的两年。还有一点，火星的自转轴和黄道面斜交成六十五度，这跟地球自转轴和黄道面斜交成六十六点五度相似；因此火星亦是斜着身子走，跟地球一样，亦有一年四季的变化。至于火星上表面的重力，比地球为小，只有三分之一。
    火星上接受太阳的光比地球少两倍半，在火星上比地球要冷些，冬天时候是摄氏零下六十度到八十度，夏天是零上十度到二十度。南北两极附近，亦和地球一样，太阳有的时候不落到地平线以下。
    另外，火星有两个卫星，也就是有两个月亮。
    火星上的一些情况
    地球表面有很厚的大气层，火星表面也有大气层包围着，但是比地球稀薄。用望远镜可以看到火星上的云雾。最显著的，是火星南北极的两个白斑，很像地球上的冰雪，这就是极冠。极冠冬季会变大，春季逐渐缩小，好像是因为天气暖和冰雪溶化了一样。在望远镜里，还可以看到火星上有些黑色条纹，过去有人认为这是火星上的人开凿的运河；照现在科学家研究的情形看来，这可能是火星上的裂缝。我们还可以看到火星上的斑点，有红橙色的、也有蓝色和暗绿色的。有些斑点的颜色随着季节在变化：冬天是灰褐色的；春天来了以后，颜色逐渐加深，秋天又变成淡灰色。苏联天文学家研究了这些有趣的现象，认为：红橙色的斑点是沙漠，蓝色和绿色的斑点是火星上的植物，它们也像地球上的植物一样，随着季节的不同在变换着颜色。
      火星上有生命吗？
    大家知道，生命存在必须有一定条件：温度、空气和水。火星上是有空气的，不过比地球稀薄得多，大约相当于地球十五公里高空的空气，空气成份以碳酸气比较多，氧气很少，只有地球上氧气15％。温度在上面已经说过。至于水份，我们用望远镜看到极冠上有冰和雪，那自然就有水了。根据这些情况来看，火星上是很可能有生命存在的。苏联科学院通信院士奇霍夫多年研究火星，用光谱分析研究了地球上的各种植物类型，把这些类型去和火星上的斑点的光谱观测资料相比较，认为火星上的植物应该是和地球上两极地区或高山、高原上的苔藓植物相似。并且已经成立了一门新兴的学科，叫做天体植物学，并在哈萨克科学院建了一所天体植物研究室，这为研究天体有无生命开辟了新的道路。
    有很多科学家都认为火星上有植物；既然有了植物，亦完全可能有动物。但是到底能否成为事实，还有待于今后的研究，因为现在还没有充分的证据和材料，所以不敢肯定。同时还有一部分学者反对这种看法。
    火星观测的意义
    火星轨道在地球轨道的外侧，我们从地球上看，它在天空上的移动方向，非常复杂，有时由西向东移动，有时由东向西移动，有时又好像停留着不动；我们祖先把火星叫做“荧惑”，可以说就是由于这种使人迷惑的移动的缘故。
    我们知道，当波兰天文学家哥白尼（1473—1543年）发见地动学说的时候，人们还不明白行星绕太阳旋转的轨道。到了德国天文学家刻白尔（1571—1630年）发见行星运行的三大定律以后，才解决这个问题。刻白尔的这个伟大发现，是根据丹麦天文学家第谷（1546—1601年）对于火星的三十多年的忠实的观测纪录。由此可以知道过去火星观测，具有过重大的意义。
    火星上有植物生存着，几乎是已经证实了的事实。这又一次地证实了马克思、列宁哲学对于生命的看法；这就是，生命是物质发展的正常过程，只要有适当的条件，生命总可以发生的。
    这次火星的接近地球，是给我们观察火星的好机会。可惜北京天文馆的天文台还没有建成，不能用十三厘米的望远镜来观测，只用几架小望远镜供群众观察。
