Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 27th: The writing systems of the Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Xibe ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will all be reformed using the Cyrillic alphabet to create new writing systems. The writing systems of the Uzbek and Tatar ethnic groups will adopt the Cyrillic alphabet currently used by the Uzbek and Tatar ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. The reform of the Mongolian language will be implemented according to the new writing system plan formulated by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This writing system reform plan was decided at the Autonomous Region Ethnic Language and Writing Science Discussion Meeting convened by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Language and Writing Reform Committee, held in Urumqi from the 15th to the 22nd.

More than 240 representatives of language and writing workers from various ethnic groups and representatives from all walks of life participated in this meeting. The meeting also proposed creating a writing system for the Tajik ethnic group in the future and further studying the writing system reform work of the Daur ethnic group.

The writing systems currently used by the aforementioned ethnic groups all have a long history. They have made significant contributions to the development of their respective ethnic cultures, enriching the cultural treasury of the motherland, and consolidating ethnic unity. However, these writing systems have shortcomings such as many variations in glyphs, complex additional symbols, and inconvenient writing, which prevent them from fully expressing the entire language of each ethnic group, causing many difficulties for the people in their use and in newspapers and publications, and cannot meet the needs of socialist cultural construction. After the new writing system based on the Cyrillic alphabet is implemented, the above shortcomings can be resolved. It will also create favorable conditions for other ethnic groups, especially Han cadres, to learn the languages of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, enabling cadres of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to better help and learn from each other. On the closing day of the meeting, Saifuddin, Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, attended and spoke. He pointed out that with the development of the autonomous region's socialist construction, the writing systems currently used by the people of all ethnic groups can no longer meet the needs, and it is more appropriate to formulate a new writing system based on the Cyrillic alphabet. Some problems cannot be solved all at once, and continued scientific research work must be carried out after the meeting.

    维吾尔、哈萨克等民族的文字
    将采用斯拉夫字母进行改革
    新华社乌鲁木齐27日电　新疆维吾尔自治区维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、锡伯等四个民族的文字都将采用斯拉夫字母重新制定新文字；乌孜别克、塔塔尔两个民族的文字将采用苏联乌兹别克民族和鞑靼民族目前使用的斯拉夫字母的文字；蒙古族文字的改革将根据内蒙古自治区制定的新文字方案实施。这个文字改革方案是15日到22日在乌鲁木齐市举行、由新疆维吾尔自治区语言文字改革委员会召开的自治区民族语言文字科学讨论会确定的。
    参加这次会议的有各民族语言文字工作者代表和各族各界代表共二百四十多人。这个会议还提出今后将为塔吉克族创造文字，进一步研究达呼尔族的文字改革工作。
    上述各民族现在应用的文字都有悠久的历史，它们对于发展本民族的文化，丰富祖国文化宝库，巩固民族团结都有过重大的贡献。但是这些文字因有字形变化多，附加符号复杂，书写不便等缺点，不能充分表达出各民族的全部语言，使人民在使用的时候以及在报纸、出版等方面造成许多困难，不能适应社会主义文化事业建设的需要。以斯拉夫文字母为基础的新文字推行以后，上述缺点都可以得到解决。并且对于其他民族尤其是汉族干部学习新疆各民族语文创造有利的条件，使自治区各族干部能更好地互相帮助互相学习。在会议闭幕这一天，新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎到会讲话。他指出：随着自治区社会主义建设事业的发展，各族人民现在使用的文字已经不能适应需要，采用斯拉夫字母为基础制定新文字是比较适当的。有些问题还不是一次所能解决，会后还必须继续努力进行科学研究工作。
