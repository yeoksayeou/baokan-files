The first National Junior Sports Meet has opened in Qingdao. This is the first national sports meet for young people in our country's history, and it is also a major event in our country's youth and children's education. Young people and children are in a period of physical and intellectual growth. Giving them good physical education during this period, guiding them to engage in correct physical exercise, and ensuring that the vast number of young people are healthy, plays a significant role in enhancing the health of our people and will have a profound impact on the future of the motherland.

In recent years, under the slogan of cultivating young people and children into well-rounded socialist new people, youth sports activities have been widely carried out. Physical education in middle and primary schools has been continuously improved, teaching results have been significantly enhanced, and extracurricular and off-campus activities have also been widely developed. The vast number of young athletes have a strong interest in participating in sports activities, actively exercise, and have achieved outstanding results. Many people have not only reached the junior level standard but also reached the national third-level and second-level athlete standards. They are promising new forces in our country's sports athletes.

However, from the overall situation, the development of youth sports activities is still far from the requirements of the country and the actual needs of the vast number of young people and children. The scope of youth sports activities is not wide enough, and the quality of physical education is not high enough. In the past, relevant leading departments did not give due attention to youth sports activities, the work of improving youth physical education was carried out too slowly, and they rarely understood and studied the situation of youth sports activities. Therefore, we must earnestly strengthen the leadership of youth sports activities, make plans, and actively and gradually develop youth sports activities.

Currently, some secondary schools do not have physical education plans, do not have physical education teachers, or the physical education teachers have not received professional sports training. This affects the quality of physical education to varying degrees. Many primary schools do not have physical education plans. Many physical education teachers do not understand sports business. Physical education teachers in middle and primary schools feel that their professional knowledge is insufficient and urgently need to improve. Relevant leading departments should meet their needs. Sports colleges can increase enrollment, and at the same time, provinces and cities should adopt flexible forms, try to run more short-term sports training classes, amateur sports schools, or send special personnel to give mobile lectures, and cultivate a large number of physical education teaching talents. Gradually equip middle and primary schools with a sufficient number of full-time physical education teachers who have received professional sports training, and constantly help them continue to improve. Now, the Ministry of Education has compiled the physical education teaching syllabus (draft) for middle and primary schools. This teaching syllabus will be piloted nationwide, and it is hoped that all schools will conscientiously implement it to improve the quality of physical education.

In order to exercise the body, there must be sufficient sports equipment and activity venues. At present, there are not many schools with better sports equipment and wider activity venues. To solve this problem, in addition to the education administrative departments appropriately increasing some sports funds for schools, various places can also enrich sports equipment according to different conditions and local conditions, in accordance with the principle of frugality. Make full use of existing sports venues, let young people and children get exercise, and help them exercise. Relevant departments should make plans for setting up sports venues and gradually seek solutions.

Developing youth sports activities must pay attention to the characteristics of young people and children, and young people and children cannot be allowed to carry out activities according to the items and rules of adults, using the equipment of adults. When organizing them to participate in sports activities, they should be grouped according to different ages and should not be treated in a one-size-fits-all manner as adults. If you do not pay attention to the characteristics of young people and children and make excessive demands, it will affect their physical health and even cause accidents. There is very little sports equipment suitable for young people and children, and it is hoped that relevant parties will pay attention to solving this problem.

From the growth process of an excellent athlete, they must be exercised from a young age to achieve outstanding achievements when they grow up. At present, a large number of excellent young athletes have emerged in our country. If we train them well in a timely manner according to their different specialties, and can absorb them to participate in youth and youth amateur sports school studies, then a group of national and world record creators will emerge among them, making new contributions to improving the technical level of sports in our country.

We believe that the first National Junior Sports Meet will achieve excellent results. The conference will be of great help in strengthening sports education for young people, stimulating the enthusiasm and interest of the vast number of young people in participating in physical exercise regularly, further developing youth sports activities, and discovering talented young athletes.

We wish the first National Junior Sports Meet a success!
We wish the vast number of young friends in our country good health!

    祝少年们身体好
    全国第一届少年体育运动大会在青岛开幕了。这是我国历史上第一次全国性的少年体育运动大会，也是我国少年儿童教育事业中的一件大事。少年儿童正处在长身体长知识的时期，在这个时期给他们以良好的体育教育，引导他们正确地进行体育锻炼，使广大的少年们身体好，这对于增进我国人民的健康有着重大的作用，对于祖国的未来将发生深远的影响。
    几年来，在培养少年儿童成为全面发展的社会主义新人的口号下，少年体育运动已经广泛开展。中、小学校中的体育教学不断改进，教学效果显著提高，课外、校外活动也都有了广泛开展。广大少年运动员对参加体育活动有着浓厚的兴趣，积极锻炼，获得了出色的成绩。许多人不仅达到了少年级标准，而且达到了国家三级和二级运动员标准。他们是我国体育运动员中很有希望的新生力量。
    但从整个情况来说，少年体育运动的开展距离国家的要求和广大少年儿童的实际需要还很远。少年体育运动开展的面还不够广阔，体育教学的质量还不够高。有关领导部门过去对少年体育运动没有给予应有的重视，对改进少年体育教学的工作进行得过于迟缓，也很少对少年体育运动的情况进行了解和研究。因此，我们要切实地加强对少年体育运动的领导，并且作出规划，积极地逐步地开展少年体育运动。
    目前，有些中等学校没有体育教学计划，没有体育教师，或是体育教师没有受过体育专业训练。这就在不同程度上影响到体育教学的质量。许多小学没有体育教学计划。许多体育教师不懂体育业务。中学和小学的体育教师都感到自己业务知识不足，迫切要求提高。有关领导部门应当满足他们的这种要求。体育学院可以增加招生名额，同时，各省市应当采用灵活的形式，尽量多办些短期的体育训练班、业余体育学校，或派专人作流动讲学，大量培养体育教学人才，给中、小学校逐步配备起足够数量的经过体育专业训练的专职体育教师，并且要不断地帮助他们继续提高。现在，教育部已编订出中、小学的体育教学大纲（草案）。这个教学大纲将开始在全国试行，希望各学校认真贯彻执行，提高体育教学质量。
    为了操练身体，必须具有足够的体育设备和活动场地。目前，体育设备较好、活动场地较宽的学校是不多的。要解决这个问题，除了教育行政部门适当地给学校增加一些体育经费以外，各地还可以根据不同的条件、因地制宜，按照节约的原则，充实体育设备。充分运用现有运动场地，让少年儿童得到锻炼，并且帮助他们锻炼。有关部门应当作出设置体育场地的规划，逐步求得解决。
    开展少年体育运动必须注意到少年儿童的特点，不能让少年儿童按照成年人的项目和成年人的规则，使用成年人的器材去进行活动。在组织他们参加体育活动的时候，应当按照不同的年龄分组，不能像对待成年人那样一揽子地进行。如果不注意少年儿童的特点，要求过高，那就会影响他们身体的健康，甚至发生事故。体育器材适合少年儿童用的很少，希望有关方面能注意解决。
    从一个优秀运动员的成长过程来说，必须从小就进行锻炼，才可能在长大以后取得杰出的成就。目前，我国已经涌现了大批优秀的少年运动员。如果我们及时地根据他们不同的特长进行很好的训练，并且能吸收他们参加青年和少年业余体育学校学习，那么，他们当中就将会出现一批国家和世界纪录的创造者，对提高我国体育运动的技术水平作出崭新的贡献。
    我们相信，全国第一届少年体育运动大会一定会获得优良的结果。大会对于加强少年的体育教育工作，激发广大少年经常参加体育锻炼的热情和兴趣，进一步开展少年体育运动，会有很大的帮助，并且将发现有才能的少年运动员。
    谨祝全国第一届少年体育运动大会的成功！
    谨祝我国广大的少年朋友们身体好！
