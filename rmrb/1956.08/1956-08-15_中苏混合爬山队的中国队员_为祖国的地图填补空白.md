Xinhua News Agency, Mustagh Ata, August 14th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Kexian): The Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team's scientific research activities in the Mustagh Ata area have concluded. On the afternoon of the 13th, the last scientific research team returned to the Kanjut Sar base camp from the north slope of Mustagh Ata.

　　Since the 5th, the mountaineering team successively dispatched three research teams to operate around Mustagh Ata. The team members reached many places that were blank even on the most accurate maps. The Chinese mountaineering team members drew their newly discovered locations and glaciers on the map of the motherland.

　　The scientific research teams reached the ends of the main glaciers. For the first time, Chinese athletes erected markers of glacier retreat and glacier melting intensity on the glaciers of the motherland to continue scientific research on glaciers in the future. The athletes also photographed the flow patterns of the main glaciers as data. The athletes also collected plant specimens and various rock specimens they saw at the ends of each glacier.

　　In early August, Mustagh Ata experienced wind and rain. Many athletes still worked despite the wind and rain.

    体育新闻中苏混合爬山队的中国队员
    为祖国的地图填补空白
    新华社慕士塔格山14日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队的慕士塔格山区科学研究活动已经结束。十三日下午，最后一个科学研究组从慕士塔格山北坡回到坎其拜尔苏的大本营。
    爬山队从五日起，陆续派出三个研究组，围绕着慕士塔格山活动。队员们走到了不少连最精确的地图上也是一片空白的地方。中国爬山队员把他们新发现的地点和冰河，画在祖国的地图上。
    科学研究组曾经到达了各主要冰河的尾部，中国运动员第一次在祖国的冰河上竖立了冰河萎退的标记和冰河融化强度的标记，以便日后继续进行对冰河的科学研究。对于主要冰河的流状，运动员也一一摄影作为资料。运动员还在各个冰河尾部搜集了他们见到的植物标本和各种岩石标本。
    八月上旬，慕士塔格山下风雨交加。不少运动员仍然冒着狂风大雨工作。
