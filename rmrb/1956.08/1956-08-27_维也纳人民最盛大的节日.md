　　Vienna People's Most Grand Festival
　　Xie Wenqing

　　Since 1945, the people of Vienna have looked forward to the first Sunday of August every year, because this day is the day of the festival held by the Austrian Communist Party's newspaper "Austrian People's Voice." On this day, people put on their most beloved clothes, in a happy mood, with their families, in pairs, or with friends, to go to the tree-lined Prater Park to participate in the festival. They all know that spending three schillings (Austrian currency) to buy a ticket is to show their support for the voice of the Austrian people, and to do their part for the cause of peace, democracy, and defending the rights of the working people. The festival is also a way to strengthen the connection between the Communist Party and the working people, and to enhance the friendship between the working people. People can participate in various recreational activities at the festival, and also listen to speeches by communists, understand the truth of the current international and domestic situation from their speeches, clarify their goals, and draw courage for the struggle. Every year at the festival, clear political slogans are put forward.

　　This year, some people were also worried about "whether the festival could be held." The bourgeois newspapers slandered and said: "The past festivals were held by the Soviet garrison. This year the Soviet army has withdrawn, and the Communist Party cannot afford to hold the festival!" But the large-scale preparatory work carried out in the months before the festival surprised these rumor-mongers. More than two thousand activists led many workers day and night to participate in the preparatory work in the form of voluntary labor. Comrade Lean, the person in charge of the festival preparation committee, said: "People say we can't afford to hold the festival, but we have to make it better and bigger, and show them our strength!" This year's preparations for the festival were particularly busy and intense. Preparatory committees for each district were established in every district of Vienna. Seeing this situation, the Vienna City Government also came forward to obstruct it. It once ordered that Prater Park should not be rented for the festival. But the Communist Party members in the city council, with the support of the people, broke this administrative obstruction. On August 5th, Prater Park, as in previous years, opened its doors to the workers of Vienna, and the festival was held as scheduled.

　　This year's festival was the largest in eleven years. At the festival, a policeman asked Comrade Donay of the festival preparation committee: "How many people are participating in the festival today?" Comrade Donay asked him to estimate it himself. The policeman thought for a while, held up five fingers and flipped them over, saying, "Well, it's over 100,000 people!" But according to preliminary statistics, more than 120,000 tickets were sold that day.

　　There are all kinds of activities at the festival, and everyone can find activities that suit their tastes here. There are sports activities, exhibitions, various recreational activities, and two stages for performing arts programs. Tens of thousands of spectators gathered in front of each stage. The Slovak Song and Dance Troupe came specially from Bratislava to perform wonderful songs and dances. A small violin team from Hungary also came to play dozens of pieces of music. Their music attracted tens of thousands of listeners, and they played many famous Viennese tunes. When they were excited, people couldn't help but sing and dance along with the music. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries also held photo exhibitions here. The workers of Vienna saw the happy life and labor construction of the people of socialist countries in these photos.

　　The festival is also divided into twenty-three districts according to Vienna's administrative divisions. Each district has its own activity center, and they compete with each other to attract the crowded people with various literary and artistic and recreational activities. In the various gift display sheds, there are 240,000 gifts of all sizes donated to the festival by the workers of Vienna. In addition, there are a large number of gifts from the newspapers of fraternal parties of various countries. Among them are the latest model of cars made in the German Democratic Republic, the world-famous "Jawa" brand motorcycles made in Czechoslovakia and sold in 120 countries, and the exquisite Chinese handicrafts praised by the world. All these gifts are sold in the form of a charity sale. For three schillings you can draw a lottery ticket. A total of 44,000 people won various gifts, including some who won cars and motorcycles. The income from the charity sale will be used partly as the funding for next year's festival, and the other part as the fund for the "Austrian People's Voice."

　　The grand festival in Vienna on August 5 this year also showed the strong solidarity of the working class of all countries. The newspapers of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Soviet Union, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and China sent representatives to participate in the festival and delivered speeches at the festival. Among them, the Soviet "Pravda" and the Chinese "People's Daily" sent representatives for the first time, so their speeches were particularly warmly welcomed. The representative of "People's Daily" was often surrounded by enthusiastic people asking questions. They showed a particularly keen feeling to these friends who had come to Vienna from Beijing after traveling about half the globe. People asked how big China really was, what mountains and rivers China had; asked what clothes Chinese people wore and what food they ate; asked how China's socialist construction was going; asked how much the lives of Chinese workers had improved. An old woman with white hair and tears welling up in her eyes patted my shoulder and said: "Go around more, talk to our workers more! Meeting you, shaking hands, and talking will give the Austrian workers the confidence and courage to fight. They will personally feel that on the other side of the earth, there are also their closest comrades supporting their struggle for democracy, freedom and socialism!"

　　On the night of August 5th, colorful and fantastic fireworks were set off in the high sky of Vienna. The fireworks were launched for more than half an hour, which was the end of the festival. The most grand festival of the people of Vienna ended in this late night.

    维也纳人民最盛大的节日
    谢文清
    自从1945年以来，维也纳人民每年都盼望着八月份的第一个星期日，因为这一天是奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”举办的联欢节的日子。在这一天，人们穿上自己最心爱的衣裳，带着愉快的心情，全家、成对或携着朋友到那林木遮天的普拉特公园去参加联欢节。他们都知道，花上三个先命（奥币）买一张入场券，就是表明自己对奥地利人民的呼声的支持，就是自己为和平、民主和保卫劳动人民权利的事业尽了一点力量。联欢节也是加强共产党同劳动人民的联系、增进劳动人民之间友谊的一种方式。人们在联欢节上可以参加各种游艺，同时也听听共产党人的演说，从他们的演说中了解当前国际、国内局势的真相，明确行动目标，并吸取斗争的勇气。每年联欢节上，都提出明确的政治口号。
    今年，也曾有人担心“联欢节是否搞得起来”。资产阶级的报刊诬蔑说：“过去的联欢节是苏联驻军举办的，今年苏军撤走了，共产党办不起联欢节了！”但在联欢节前几个月进行的规模庞大的筹备工作就使这些造谣者吃了一惊。两千多个积极分子带领着许多工人日夜不停地以义务劳动的方式参加筹备工作，联欢节筹备委员会负责同志列安说：“人家说我们搞不起联欢节，我们偏要搞得更好、更大，要显示我们的力量给他们瞧瞧！”今年联欢节的筹备工作特别繁忙紧张，维也纳每个区都建立了区的筹备委员会。看到这种情况，维也纳市政府也曾出面阻挠，它曾命令不准把普拉特公园租让给联欢节用。但共产党在市议会的议员在人民支持下打破了这个行政阻碍，八月五日这天，普拉特公园像往年一样，向维也纳的劳动者敞开着大门，联欢节如期举行了。
    今年联欢节的规模是十一年来最大的一次。在联欢节上，曾经有一个警察问联欢节筹备委员会的唐奈同志：“今天有多少人参加联欢节？”唐奈同志请他自己估计一下。这个警察想了一会，伸出五指翻了一下说：“嗯，总在十万人以上！”可是据初步统计，这一天出售的入场券却达十二万多张。
    联欢节上有各种各样的活动，每个人都可以在这里找到合于自己口味的活动节目。有体育活动，有展览会，有各种游艺，有两个演出文艺节目的舞台。每个舞台前都聚集着上万的观众。斯洛伐克歌舞团特地从布拉迪斯拉发赶来演出精彩的歌舞。匈牙利也有一个小提琴队赶来演奏了几十支乐曲。他们的琴声吸引了成千上万的听众，他们演奏了许多著名的维也纳乐曲。兴浓时，人们都情不自禁地手舞足蹈地随着琴声歌唱了起来。捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利等国还在这里举办有图片展览，维也纳的劳动者在这些图片上看到了社会主义国家的人民的幸福生活和劳动建设。
    联欢节还按维也纳的行政区划而划分为二十三个区，每个区都有自己的活动中心，都互相比赛，以各种文艺和游艺活动吸引着拥挤的人群。在各个礼品陈列棚里陈列着二十四万件大大小小的由维也纳劳动者向联欢节捐献的礼物。此外，还有各国兄弟党的机关报赠送的大批礼物。其中有德意志民主共和国造的最新式的小汽车，有捷克斯洛伐克造的名闻全球并行销一百二十个国家的“雅瓦”牌摩托车，也有举世赞美的精细的中国手工艺品。所有这些礼物都以义卖的方式出售。花三个先令就可抽一张彩票。共有四万四千人抽到了各种不同的礼物，其中有人抽到了小汽车和摩托车。义卖的收入将以一部分用作下一年联欢节的经费，另一部分作为“奥地利人民之声报”的基金。
    在今年八月五日维也纳盛大的联欢节上，也表明了各国工人阶级的坚强团结。苏联、意大利、法国、德国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和中国等各国共产党和工人党的机关报都派代表参加了联欢节，并在联欢节上发表了演说。其中苏联“真理报”和中国“人民日报”是第一次派出代表，所以他们的讲话受到特别热烈的欢迎。“人民日报”的代表经常被热情的人们围住问长问短。他们对这些从北京经过约半个地球的路途来到维也纳的朋友表现了一种特别热切的感情。人们问中国到底有多么大，中国有什么山、什么河；问中国人穿什么衣裳，吃什么饭；问中国的社会主义建设进行得怎么样了；问中国工人的生活提高了多少。一位白发苍苍的老太太含着夺眶欲出的泪珠拍着我的肩膀说：“多到各处走走，多同我们的工人谈谈吧！同你们见见面，握握手，谈谈话，就会给奥地利的工人以斗争的信心和勇气。他们会亲身感到在地球的那一边，也有着他们最亲密的同志支持着他们为民主、自由和社会主义而作的斗争！”
    八月五日的夜晚，在维也纳的高空放出了五光十色变幻离奇的焰火，焰火放射了半个多小时，这是联欢节的尾声了。维也纳人民最盛大的节日就在这深夜中结束了。
