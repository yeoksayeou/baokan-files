Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 10th. Tianjin's five state-owned cotton textile factories saved more than 257,000 kilograms of raw cotton for the country from April to July. In July, the average cotton consumption per yarn bale in these five factories was 192.92 kilograms, which is more than two kilograms less than the national standard.

The reason these five factories were able to save a large amount of raw cotton was because they adjusted the technological design of the "scutcher" and "steel wire" processes, and increased the production of coarser yarns. In the past, a lot of cotton fibers were lost in the "scutcher" impurity removal process. In May, the factories fully analyzed the performance of the raw cotton and appropriately improved the air intake method, which reduced the waste cotton rate of the "scutcher" process by 0.5%. Appropriately extending the cleaning cycle of "picker laps" in the "steel wire" process also reduced the raw cotton consumption by 0.2% per yarn bale. These factories also increased the production of three types of coarse yarns, which made full use of the waste cotton after impurity removal, which also greatly reduced the consumption of raw cotton.

In July, the first-grade, first-quality yarn produced by these five factories all exceeded the national standards, and four of them reached 100%.

### 天津五个棉纺厂  节约原棉二十五万多公斤

    天津五个棉纺厂
    节约原棉二十五万多公斤
    新华社天津10日电　天津市五个国营棉纺织厂在四至七月内，为国家节约了二十五万七千多公斤原棉。七月份这五个厂每件纱的平均用棉量是一百九十二点九二公斤，比国家规定的标准少两公斤以上。
    这五个厂能节约大量原棉，是由于调整了“清花”、“钢丝”工序的工艺设计，并且增产了一部分粗支纱。过去在“清花”除杂过程中损失的棉纤维很多，各厂在五月份充分分析了原棉的性能，适当地改进了进风方法等，使得“清花”工序的落棉率降低了0.5％。“钢丝”工序适当延长了清除“抄车花”的周期，又使每件纱可以少用0.2％的原棉。这些厂还增产了三种粗支纱，使除去杂质以后的落棉得到了充分利用，这也大大地减少了原棉的消耗。
    这五个厂在七月份所生产的一等一级纱，都超过了国家规定的指标，其中有四个厂达到了100％。
