    Unnamed's "Drunken Peace"
    ——Reading Notes on Tunes
    Lei Zizhen

“Better to be a dog or chicken in times of peace than a human in times of chaos.” This is the voice of the Chinese people, who have suffered long-term war and hardship, yearning for peace.

Peace is something the people spare no blood and sweat to strive for, and successive rulers, both Chinese and foreign, have also attempted to build their "peace" on this blood and sweat. For thousands of years, although there have been several "prosperous ages" in Chinese history, which "prosperous age" was not created by the working people! Unfortunately, the fruits of the prosperous age were stolen by the feudal rulers. Therefore, what often follows the "prosperous age" is the unpeaceful "chaotic age."

Historically, there was the "prosperity" of Zhenguan and Kaiyuan, and there was also the so-called "rebellion" of Huang Chao and Song Jiang.

During the Yuan Dynasty's hundred-plus years, the rulers created contradictions between the people of the north and south, promulgated harsh laws discriminating against ethnic groups, implemented brutal tortures, engaged in bloodless usury, arbitrarily seized people's fields, wives, daughters, and culture, and mistreated intellectuals who spread culture. Such things are too numerous to recount. Their purpose was simply to establish their "peace" on the heads of the people.

However, what was the result?

When Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty was compiling "輟耕錄" (輟耕錄), he recorded an anonymous "Drunken Peace," which is now transcribed below:

	The mighty Yuan, with treacherous officials in power,
	Opening rivers and changing currency, the root of disaster.
	Causing tens of thousands of Red Turbans. [Note]
	Official laws are excessive, punishments are heavy,
	The people resent;
	People eating people, paper money buying paper money,
	When was this ever seen?
	Thieves become officials, officials become thieves,
	Mixing up the foolish and the wise.
	Alas, pitiful!

Although this tune does not point out the real causes of the sinful society, only chanting the phenomena, it expresses the people's hatred for the evil feudal rulers.

Despite the Yuan Dynasty's laws stipulating: “Those who write lyrics and tunes with the intention of committing treasonous and evil words” will “be sentenced to death.” But when "輟耕錄" recorded this tune, it said: "I don't know who created it, but from the capital to Jiangnan, everyone can recite it." It can be seen that the Chinese people were unwilling to be humiliated, and even more unafraid of death, so it has been preserved for hundreds of years through the Ming and Qing Dynasties to this day.

The Chinese people have experienced so much struggle and shed so much blood and sweat to obtain today's peace. Anyone who attempts to destroy it will repeat the same "Alas, pitiful" fate.

[Note] "Red Turbans" refers to the peasant army led by Liu Futong and Han Liner at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, also known as the "Red Army."

    无名氏的“醉太平”
    ——读曲杂记
    雷子震
    “宁为太平鸡犬，不做乱世黎民”。这是中国人民遭受了长期的战乱苦痛而发出的渴慕太平的声音。
    太平，人民不惜以血汗来争取，历代中外统治者也企图在这血汗上建立他们的“太平”。几千年来，中国历史上虽也曾出现过几次“太平盛世”，但无论汉武、唐宗，哪一“盛世”不是劳动人民所创造的呢！遗憾的是，盛世的果实却为封建统治者所窃取。因之，往往随着“太平盛世”而来的总是不太平的“乱世”。
    历史上有过贞观、开元之“盛”，也有所谓黄巢、宋江之“乱”。
    元朝百余年间，统治者制造南北人民之间的矛盾，颁定歧视民族的苛律，施用残暴的酷刑，经营杀人不见血的高利贷，任意侵占人民的田产妻女、文化，虐待传播文化的知识分子。如此种种，罄竹难书。其目的，也只是为了在人民的头上，建立他们的“太平”而已。
    然而，其结果如何呢？
    元人陶宗仪撰辍耕录时，曾录了一首无名氏的“醉太平”，现转抄于下：
    堂堂大元，奸佞专权，开河变钞祸根源。惹红巾万千〔注〕。官法滥，刑法重，黎民怨；人吃人，钞买钞，何曾见；贼做官，官做贼，混愚贤。哀哉可怜！这曲，虽然没有指出罪恶社会的真实原因，只是现象的传唱，但是，却表达出人民对于万恶的封建统治者的憎恨。
    尽管元朝法律规定：“妄撰词曲，意图犯上恶言”者“处死刑”。但辍耕录录此曲时曾说：“不知谁所造，自京师以至江南，人人能道之。”可见中国人民是不甘受辱，更不怕死，故经明、清以来数百年保存至今。
    中国人民经历了多少斗争，流了多少血汗，才得到今天的太平。谁企图破坏，谁都会再蹈“哀哉可怜”的复辙的。
    〔注〕“红巾”系指元末刘福通、韩林儿领导的农民军，或称“红军”。
