Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 6th - An agricultural production cooperative jointly organized by Han and Korean ethnic groups will see over 90% of its members increase their income this autumn, further strengthening the friendship between the two groups. This cooperative, located in Lafa Township, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, is called the ChunGuang Agricultural Cooperative.

This cooperative has 1,170 households, one-third of which cultivate paddy fields, mostly Korean members. In the early stages of the cooperative, improper handling of income distribution between paddy and dry fields caused dissatisfaction among members of both ethnicities. The initial decision was to uniformly distribute rice and dryland grain. Korean members felt that rice had a higher value and required less labor, while dryland crops had a lower value but required more labor in field operations. They opposed this unified distribution, believing it would reduce their income. Members planting dry land were satisfied with the unified distribution. After several disputes, someone suggested that if the paddy field yield exceeded the normal output, the excess would be fully subsidized to the paddy field households. However, the dryland households objected.

Based on this problem, the CCP Lafa Township General Branch extensively consulted with members of both ethnic groups and decided to allow the paddy field farmers to fully utilize their skills and increase their income. This involved three measures: increasing the paddy field area undertaken by skilled Korean and Han members, rational contract work, and overproduction rewards. After discussion, the area of paddy fields managed by each Korean member's labor force increased from five mu last year to seven mu, with higher labor remuneration based on a four-level quota, resulting in higher income. At the same time, Han members also stated that, due to lower skills, they preferred to cultivate a maximum of six mu. This also satisfied the Han members' requirements for paddy field cultivation. To avoid land disputes, more than 200 hectares of paddy fields were newly opened and distributed to each team for cultivation. During contract work, skilled paddy field households could receive compensation for the labor time they saved, while ensuring work quality. Calculations showed that cultivating one hectare of paddy field required 145 labor days for skilled Korean members, while Han members planting paddy fields for the first year required 204 labor days. Which number should be used for the contract? Someone once suggested: regardless of skill level, those who are capable should do more, meaning the skilled workers would be contracted at 145 labor days, and the less skilled at 204 labor days. Everyone believed this would weaken the enthusiasm of the skilled members. Finally, it was decided that each hectare would be contracted at 204 labor days (with specific adjustments for each plot), so the skilled team would earn 59 more labor days. Overproduction rewards were implemented. Due to differences in irrigation, rice transplanting, and other techniques, the rice yield per hectare varied by 1,000 to 2,000 jin among production teams. The cooperative set the baseline yield for each team at 8,000 to 9,000 jin, which is the level that the average team planting paddy fields for the first year could achieve. Production teams exceeding this target would receive 60% of the overproduction as a reward.

According to inspections in early July, after adopting the above measures, the 304 Korean households that planted paddy fields last year had already earned nearly 100 labor days, surpassing the dryland team members, ensuring that over 90% of the households would increase their income. According to income estimates from 58 Korean households, each member could earn 60 more labor day rewards this year than last year, with a total income of 459 yuan, slightly higher than last year. This is calculated based on the minimum income of only 2.7 yuan per labor day. If the plan is completed and overproduction rewards are added, the income will be significantly higher than last year.

The measures to increase the income of paddy field households have consistently encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members. Han and Korean members are more united, and the cooperative has newly opened 220 hectares of paddy fields.

    运用了劳动好技术高多分配的原则
    春光社种水田的朝鲜族社员种旱田的汉族社员普遍增加收入
    新华社长春6日电　一个由汉族、朝鲜族共同组织起来的农业生产合作社，今年秋收将有90％以上的社员增加收入，而且两族人民的友谊进一步得到巩固。这个社在吉林省蛟河县拉法乡，名叫春光农业社。
    这个社有一千一百七十户农户，其中三分之一农户是种水田，而且大部分是朝鲜族社员。建社初期，由于水田、旱田收益分配处理不当，使两族社员都不愉快。当时决定，稻子和旱田粮食统一分配，朝鲜族社员认为，稻子价值高，花费劳动少，旱田作物价值低，田间操作花费劳动多，实行统一分配，自己收入就会减少，他们反对这种做法。种旱田的社员对统一分配很满意。经过几次争执，有人提出如果水田高出常年产量，就把超过部分全数补助给水田户。但旱田户反对。
    中共拉法乡总支根据这个问题，广泛和两族社员群众商谈，决定采取让种水田的社员充分施展他们的技能，也增加他们的收入。这就是增加朝鲜族与汉族社员种水田熟手所担负的水田面积、合理包工和超产奖励三个办法。经过讨论，朝鲜族社员每个劳动力负担面积从去年五亩增加到七亩，按照四级定额，水田劳动报酬又高，他们收入就多了。同时，汉族社员也提出，因为技术低，情愿最多种六亩地。这样也满足了汉族社员种水田的要求。为了避免双方争地，新开了二百多公顷水田，分给各队耕作。包工时，在保证作业质量的原则下，技术熟练的水田户可以得到自己所节省下的工时报酬。经过计算，种一公顷水田，技术熟练的朝鲜族社员只要一百四十五个劳动日，而第一年种水田的汉族社员就要付出二百零四个劳动日。按哪个数字包工呢？曾经有人认为：不分技术高低，能者多劳，就叫有技术的按一百四十五个劳动日包工，技术低的按二百零四个劳动日包工。大家认为这会削弱技术高的社员的积极性。最后决定每公顷按二百零四个劳动日包工（每块地具体调整），技术高的队就会多得五十九个劳动日。实行超产奖励。各个生产队由于灌溉、插秧等技术不同，每公顷水稻产量相差一、二千斤。这个社按一般第一年种水田的队所能达到的八千到九千斤作为各队基础产量标准，凡是超产的生产队则可以得到超产部分的60％的奖励。
    据七月上旬的检查，采用上述办法后，去年种水田的三百零四户朝鲜族社员已经得到劳动日将近一百个，超过了旱田队员，可以保证90％以上农户都能增加收入。据五十八户朝鲜族社员的收入概算，今年每个社员可以比去年多收入六十个劳动日报酬，总收入可达四百五十九元，比去年略有增加。这仅是按每个劳动日只分二元七角的最低收入计算，如果完成计划加上超产奖励，就可以显著地比去年多了。
    增加水田户收入的作法，一直鼓舞着社员的生产热情。汉族和朝鲜族社员更加团结了，并且全社新开了水田二百二十公顷。
