    "Unspeakable Difficulties"
    Mǎ Qiánzú
    After publishing "Regarding Deletion and Alteration," I couldn't help but feel "apprehensive." Being an editor myself, while I don't necessarily subscribe to Ah Q-ism and conceal the "scab" on my head, I must expose my scalp and proclaim to everyone: "I have a scab here!" This may not necessarily be considered brave, but the most important thing is how to prevent scabs from growing on myself again.

    In the past, many writers started out as editors, but now very few writers are willing to become editors. Times have changed, and editors are often "subjected" to writers' "scolding": dissatisfaction with "revising manuscripts," "delaying manuscripts," and "manuscript fees" – the so-called "three manuscripts" problem – all converge on the publishing house editors. In righteous indignation, some even declared at a writers' association symposium that they would expel a certain editor from a publishing house, who was involved in approving manuscript fees, from the association. Editors have thus become the target of public criticism. Alas! The difficulty of being an editor is indeed more difficult than ascending to the blue sky.

    Naturally, we will never shirk responsibility. Arbitrarily deleting and altering writers' articles is, in any case, wrong. However, the difficulty of an editor's situation is beyond the imagination of outsiders. It is truly a case of having "unspeakable difficulties."

    Some say that whether the "Hundred Schools of Thought" can be developed depends on the editors of publishing houses. But they don't know that editors have even more hurdles to overcome. As far as I know about a certain publishing house, editors face three hurdles: The first is the "criticism hurdle." Once a book is published, and receives social criticism, the responsibility falls on the editor. Readers, upon seeing the criticism, regardless of whether they have actually read the book or not, write letters to denounce it. The second is the "reader hurdle." But these two "hurdles" are still relatively easy to overcome. "Grievances have their source, debts have their debtor." The book is written by the writer. For the editor, at most, it's a matter of committing the "crime" of "oversight," and an explanation will suffice. But then comes the "self-criticism hurdle." This comes from higher authorities and simply cannot be avoided. So, let's "self-criticize," but often once is not enough, twice; twice is not enough, three times. It is truly a major hurdle.

    Some time ago, I saw an abstract of a commentary in the People's Daily introducing the Soviet magazine "Communist," entitled "Importance of Plekhanov's Philosophical Legacy." The last paragraph said: "The book reviewer also pointed out that some of the shortcomings in the book should be the responsibility of the State Political Books Publishing Bureau. The publishing bureau delayed the publication of Fomina's work for five years, during which the book was subjected to much criticism, in effect forcing the author to accept the then-widely popular erroneous views." This statement couldn't help but make people smile wryly. Although the views are erroneous, they are "widely popular," so the responsibility is not with the editors of the publishing bureau. The world only has famous professors and famous reporters, but rarely sees famous editors; it is difficult for editors not to be swept away by "widely popular" views. What is the reason? The three hurdles are difficult to overcome. And the so-called three hurdles are, in fact, nothing more than "widely popular" social trends.

    In order to respond to the "Hundred Schools of Thought," responsibilities must be clearly distinguished. I believe that editors should bear political responsibility, but other than that, writers should bear the literary responsibility themselves. In this way, the three hurdles will be broken, and editors will not be seen as obstacles to the "Hundred Schools of Thought."

### “难言之隐”

    “难言之隐”
    马前卒
    发表了“关于删改”，心里不免“愀然”。自己也是当编辑的，虽然不必抱阿Q主义，讳言头上的“癞”，但一定要扒开头发，扬言于众：“我这里有个癞疤！”也未必算是勇敢，问题是怎样使自己身上不再长癞疮，最为要着。
    在过去是，不少作家是当编辑起家的，而现在则是很少作家愿意当编辑。时易势移，编辑就常常“挨”到作家的“骂”：“改稿”、“压稿”和“稿费”——所谓“三稿”问题的不满，全都集中到出版社编辑身上，甚至义愤之余，有人在作协座谈会上，竟声言要开除某出版社与核定稿费有关的某编辑的会籍了。编辑也就这样成为众矢之的。噫嘘嚱！编辑之难，确也难于上青天了。
    自然，我们也决不推诿责任。任意删改作家的文章，无论如何是不应该的。但做编辑的处境之难，决不是外人所能想像的。真所谓有“难言之隐。”
    有人说，“百家争鸣”能否开展，其中的一个大关，就在于出版社的编辑。但他们不知道编辑要过的关更多。就我所知道的某出版社来说，编辑有三关：第一个是“批评关”。一本书出来了，一受到社会批评，责任就落在编辑身上。读者看到批评，不管是否自己真的读过那书没有，于是写信来纷纷斥责，第二个来了“读者关”。可是这两个“关”，还是容易过的。“冤有头，债有主”，书是作家写的，对编辑说来，最多不过是犯了“失察”之“罪”，解释一番也就罢了。但接着而来的还有“检讨关”。这是上级下来的，不过是不行的。那就“检讨”吧，可是往往是一次不行，二次；二次不行，三次。实在是个大难关。
    前些时候，看到人民日报一篇介绍苏联“共产党人”杂志的评论“重视普列哈诺夫的哲学遗产”的文章摘要。最后一段说：“书评作者又指出，书中的某些缺点是应由国家政治书籍出版局负责。出版局把福米娜的著作一直拖了五年才出版，在这当中这本书遭到了许多批评，事实上就是硬要作者接受当时广为流行的错误见解。”这段话不免叫人哑然失笑。见解虽然错误，却是“广为流行的”，可见责任还不在出版局的编辑。世上只有名教授、名记者，却还很少看到名编辑；编辑而不为“广为流行”的见解所漂没，是很难的。什么原因呢？三关难过。而所谓三关者，事实上也是“广为流行”的社会风气而已也。
    为了响应“百家争鸣”，必须明辨责任。我以为，编辑应负的是政治责任，除此而外，文责概由作家自负。如此，则三关破，而编辑也不至于被看作是“百家争鸣”的拦路石了。
