Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, August 18th. In the past month or so, twenty-nine jointly owned public-private stores in Shanghai have moved to Luoyang under the unified arrangement of the government.

These stores include those dealing in general merchandise, cotton cloth, stationery, and medicine, as well as service industries such as clothing manufacturing. Among them are the Wanguo Pharmacy, Dadong Department Store, and Lao Jielun Cotton Cloth Store, which are all relatively well-known stores in Shanghai.

Since these stores opened in Luoyang, their business has been very good, and their turnover is generally higher than in Shanghai. For example, since the opening of the Lao Jielun Cotton Cloth Store in Luoyang, it has been full of customers, and the average daily sales volume has increased by more than half compared to Shanghai. The Guang Shengxiang and Dadong department stores have a high demand for undershirts brought from Shanghai, and the daily sales volume of cosmetics has increased more than seven times compared to Shanghai.

Although these stores have moved to Luoyang from Shanghai, more than two thousand miles away, the customers they meet here are not all strangers. More than half of the customers received by the Dadong Department Store every day were originally workers and their families in Shanghai. At present, these stores have a high level of enthusiasm for business and are preparing to expand their procurement plans, increase the variety of goods they offer, and better serve their customers.

    上海一批商店迁洛阳
    新华社洛阳18日电　在最近一个多月中，上海市有二十九户公私合营商店在政府的统一安排下迁来洛阳。
    这些商店，有经营百货、棉布、文具，医药等商品的，也有制造服装等服务性行业的。其中如万国药店、大东百货商店、老介伦棉布店等，在上海市都是比较著名的商店。
    这些商店在洛阳开业以来，营业情况很好，营业额一般比在上海时上升。如老介伦棉布店在洛阳开业以后一直是顾客盈门，平均每天的销货额比在上海时增加一半以上。广升祥和大东两家百货商店，从上海带来的汗衫供不应求，经营的化妆品每天的销售量比在上海时增加了七倍多。
    这些商店虽然远从二千多里的上海迁来洛阳，但是他们在这里遇见的顾客却全不是陌生的。大东百货商店每天接待的顾客，原来是在上海的工人和家属占一半以上。目前这些商店的经营情绪很高，都在准备扩大进货计划，增加经营品种，更好地为顾客服务。
