    新华社哈尔滨13日电　松花江上空前未有的高洪峰正严重地威胁着哈尔滨。松花江上游连日暴雨，松花江支流拉林河的洪峰已直泻到松花江，今天下午四时，哈尔滨地区松花江水位已高达一一九点八六公尺，超过了1932年大水灾时的最高水位，水面高出地面达三公尺。现在水势仍在继续猛涨中。
    哈尔滨市人民正在紧急动员起来保卫哈尔滨。市党政领导机关从八月十三日晨二时到中午连续召开紧急会议，动员全市一切人力、物力保卫哈尔滨的安全。哈尔滨市人民委员会、中共哈尔滨市委员会在今天分别发出命令和紧急通知，号召全市人民、党员、团员动员一切力量为确保哈尔滨安全，保卫社会主义建设，战胜洪水而斗争。
    今天，在沿江堤岸上，由全市人民和人民解放军组成的十万防汛大军正全力加固堤防和抢险；在道外二十道街的马路上已开始铺设铁道运土。全市准备用火车、汽车、大车在最近几天内将三十多万立方公尺的土送上堤防，把已修筑好的市区近二十六公里的堤坝普遍加固和加高，并且正在加紧建筑第二道堤坝。在险堤附近都配备了抢险队和抢险器材，以保护堤坝安全。
