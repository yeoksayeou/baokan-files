Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 27th. Wu Bannong, former leader of the Economic Section of the Kuomintang Government's delegation to Japan and chief representative of the delegation to the Allied Headquarters for Reparations and Restitution, and Su Menggong, former Second Secretary of the Kuomintang Government's Embassy in South Korea, returned to Tianjin on the "Xing'an Maru" ship on the 25th from Japan.

In order to achieve the goal of returning to the motherland, Wu Bannong resigned from the position entrusted to him by the Kuomintang government in May 1950 and resided in Japan. After being laid off by the Kuomintang government, Su Menggong lived in Fukuoka and Tokyo, Japan, waiting for the opportunity to return to the country. Now they have finally returned smoothly to the motherland they have been separated from for ten years.

Wu Bannong and Su Menggong both brought their families with them this time. Wu Bannong, 50, said: "We often listen to the radio broadcasts from the motherland, and when we hear about the construction of the motherland, we are often so excited that we shed tears and are determined to return to the motherland and do our part for the construction of the motherland." Su Menggong, who worked in the Kuomintang government's foreign affairs department for 20 years, said: "For many years, we have been looking forward to the independence and strength of the motherland, and today this dream has been realized."

    前国民党的两名外交官员返回祖国大陆
    新华社天津27日电　前国民党政府驻日本代表团经济组组长兼驻盟军总司令部赔偿归还代表团首席代表吴半农和前国民党政府驻南朝鲜大使馆二等秘书宿梦公，在25日乘“兴安丸”轮船由日本回到天津。
    为了达到返回祖国的目的，吴半农在1950年5月间就辞去了国民党政府委派他的职务，在日本居住。宿梦公在被国民党政府裁减以后，先后住在日本的福冈和东京，等待回国的机会，现在他们终于顺利地回到了阔别十年的祖国。
    吴半农和宿梦公这次回来的时候都带着他们的家眷。五十岁的吴半农说：“我们时常收听祖国的广播，听到祖国建设的情况，往往兴奋得流下泪来，决心返回祖国，为祖国建设尽一分力量。”在国民党政府做了二十年外交工作的宿梦公说：“多少年来我们一直盼望着祖国的独立和强盛，今天实现了这个梦想。”
