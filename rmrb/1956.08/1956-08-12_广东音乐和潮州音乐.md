At the National Music Week, the Guangdong delegation from the South, performing Guangdong music and Chaozhou music, attracted audiences at every performance and became one of the highlights of the Music Week.

The famous Guangdong music ensemble piece, "Dragon Boat Race," depicts the lively and festive scene of the Dragon Boat Festival in the fifth lunar month, a Southern custom. This piece effectively embodies the characteristics of Guangdong music: distinct rhythms, smooth melodies, and varied tunes. The music begins with the bright sounds of the suona horn, signaling the start of the dragon boat race, followed by brisk and tight percussion and orchestral music. The music draws the audience into the dragon boat racing scene, with the bustling crowd and the brave racers paddling their dragon boats seemingly appearing before their eyes. The percussion instruments become faster and heavier, successfully portraying the momentum of the "winning the pennant." Then, the melodious flute, accompanied by the sonorous drum, concludes with joy after the victory. Another piece, "Rain Hitting Banana Leaves," fully utilizes the strengths of the dulcimer, dongxiao flute, and erhu fiddle to express the mood of a rainy Southern summer night. The rain, sometimes heavy and sometimes light, patters on the banana leaves. After a burst of wind and rain, the sky clears, and the tune shifts into a peaceful realm.

The Guangdong delegation's performance of the Chaozhou large percussion ensemble "Celebrating the Harvest" uses familiar folk melodies such as "Stepping on Straw Sandals," "Nine Turns Back," and "Thrush Jumping on the Shelf" as its foundation. It utilizes the characteristics of the large percussion to express the theme of farmers joyfully celebrating the harvest. The Chaozhou orchestral piece "Butterflies Gathering Flowers" uses the mellow and gentle tone of the Chaozhou large suona horn paired with the light sound of small gongs to skillfully depict the image of butterflies dancing gracefully among the flowers.

Guangdong music has extremely rich melodies, with a strong Southern flavor, unique performance methods, and continuously improving and adding instruments. Chaozhou music is characterized by its simplicity, magnificence, healthiness, and brightness; it has a rich and diverse range of percussion instruments and can harmoniously resonate with orchestral instruments.

    广东音乐和潮州音乐
    在全国音乐周上，来自南国的广东代表队演奏的广东音乐和潮州音乐，吸引了一场场听众，成为音乐周上出色的表演之一。
    著名的广东音乐合奏节目“赛龙夺锦”，描写了南方习俗、五月端阳赛龙舟时人们热烈欢腾的情景。这首乐曲很好地体现了广东音乐节奏鲜明、旋律流畅、曲调变化多端的特点。乐曲以嘹亮的唢呐表示龙舟竞渡开始，相随而来的是轻快紧凑的锣鼓和管弦乐。音乐把人们引进了赛龙舟的场景之中，喧闹的人群、驾着龙舟竞渡的勇士仿佛出现在眼前。打击乐器愈来愈快愈重，成功地表现了“夺锦”时的声势。接着，悠扬的笛声伴随着雄浑的鼓响，以胜利后的欢欣作结束。另一支乐曲“雨打芭蕉”充分发挥了扬琴、洞箫和二胡的特长，表现了多雨的南方夏夜的情调。时大时小的雨点，敲打着芭蕉叶，在一阵疾风暴雨之后，天晴气朗，曲调转入了宁静的意境。
    广东代表队演奏的潮州大锣鼓“庆丰收”，采取“草鞋踏”、“九回头”、“画眉跳架”等民间熟悉的曲牌为基调，运用大锣鼓的特点，热闹地表达了农民欢庆丰收的主题。潮州管弦乐“粉蝶采花”，以音色圆润柔和的潮州大唢呐配着轻盈的小锣声，巧妙地描画了一双蝴蝶在花丛中翩翩飞舞的形象。
    广东音乐的曲调极其丰富，带有浓郁的南方色采，有着独特的演奏方法，乐器也在不断地增添和改良。潮州音乐是以淳朴壮丽、健康明朗为特色的；有着丰富多样的打击乐器，而且能够和管弦乐器和谐地交响。
