　　More Help for Cooperative Cadres to Improve Leadership Work

　　More people don't necessarily mean better work

　　During the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the Shicun Construction Agricultural Cooperative in Tunliu County, Shanxi, transformed from a primary cooperative of 74 households to an advanced cooperative of 210 households. After the expansion and upgrade, under the influence of the idea that "more people make things easier," the cooperative arranged a total of 101 cadres, from the cooperative director and team leaders to group leaders and section chiefs, almost one cadre for every two households. At the same time, they also believed that as long as they weren't idle, they were contributing to socialist construction. So they ran around all day, shouting and yelling; however, they didn't solve any specific problems. Last winter and this spring, in the cooperative's well-digging water conservancy project, seven cadres (cooperative director, deputy director, team leaders, etc.) ran from this well to that well every day, looking and talking. As a result, out of the thirty wells dug with more than ten thousand workdays, only ten were useful, and the other twenty had to be filled in. The members were very dissatisfied, and they made up a jingle saying, "Too many cadres, too many mouths, only talk, don't do, leadership is like a puppet." Since the transition to an advanced cooperative, the cooperative's office has had five or six cadres almost every day, some calculating accounts, some arguing, and some specifically sweeping and doing odd jobs. Zhao Chenghai, the storekeeper, only participated in the production team's weeding of seedlings for half a day in the past six months, but his non-production workdays amounted to 112, of which more than seventy were spent doing odd jobs in the office. The members reflected: It's a blessing to be a cadre, "Standing in the public house (office) for a while, you get four and a half work points."

　　In the recent rectification of the cooperative, the county committee's work team helped the cooperative cadres solve these problems. They first rectified the organization, and based on the actual situation of the cooperative, set up one person each to be responsible for management of the storehouse and the cashier, without setting up a special section; organized a livestock breeding team to manage the animals, and reduced the number of accountants from three to two. The management committee was reduced to nine people, so that there were only thirty cadres in the whole cooperative. Then, they helped the cooperative cadres examine their thinking, so that they established a working style of going deep into the masses, and established various necessary systems. After this rectification, both the cooperative cadres and the members felt that the work was orderly and things were easier to handle. The relationship between the cooperative cadres and the members has also become closer.　　　　　　Zhang Xuezhong

　　Why are there so many subsidized cooperative cadres?

　　The Shadui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dingjia Township, Bishan County, Sichuan, has a total of 418 households of members, and as many as 294 cooperative cadres enjoy misspent work subsidy treatment. This includes 19 members of the cooperative's director and deputy director, supervisors, agriculture, sideline, technical reform, capital construction, culture, education, and health committee, 24 production team leaders and deputy leaders, 12 team accountants, 36 storekeepers, 106 production group leaders and deputy leaders, 53 scorers, and health workers, technicians, spare-time school teachers, etc. The fixed subsidy work points total 45,860 points (the actual misspent work points are not yet calculated), which is nearly 4% of the total work points of the whole cooperative.

　　Although there are so many subsidized cadres, very few people actually do things. Of the 294 people mentioned above, 106 have not done any actual work. Some have never attended meetings in the cooperative or the team, some are always at home holding their babies, and some go to the fields for a walk when they are happy. When the members see them go, they say dissatisfiedly, "Those who stroll along the field edges and get work points are here again."

　　Why is there such a strange phenomenon? Originally, some county and district cadres, in order to make their own work easier, required all the cooperative cadres belonging to their own business departments in the cooperative to be subsidized with work points. Cao Zhengfang, the deputy director of the district women's federation, found the cooperative director and emphasized, "Women account for half of the population, don't underestimate women." Therefore, under her instruction, all 53 women cadres in the cooperative received subsidized work points. The cadres of the district health center also rushed to the cooperative and said, "Health care is very important, be sure to give the health workers two work points every day." The cadres of the county culture and education section said to the cooperative cadres: "The literacy campaign should be done as quickly as possible." Therefore, it was stipulated that 42 spare-time school teachers should also be given two work points per person per day; it was also stipulated that those who teach the first book of textbooks should be evaluated four points for each preparation, and those who teach the second and third books should be evaluated eight to twelve points for each preparation.

　　Please think about it, how can an agricultural cooperative be run well with so many ends tied up at the same time!　　　　　Zhou Xinmao

　　Leading agricultural cooperatives cannot always sit in the office

　　The cadres of the Huai Road Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gupei Township, Jiashan County, Anhui, are busy with clerical work such as approving notes every day, and the cooperative's production is not doing well.

　　Take several major farm works such as plowing, sowing, weeding, wheat harvesting, and transplanting rice seedlings. The management committee has never organized any forces to go deep into the team (group) to check and accept them once. Usually, production guidance is accustomed to verbal calls, meeting arrangements, and accustomed to making decisions sitting in the office. For example, when the cooperative pre-paid and settled the work point accounts of each team (group) in the summer, the directors and accountants in the cooperative did not proceed from the actual situation, and subjectively decided that no matter how many times the spring-sown corn and sorghum had been weeded, they would be recorded as weeding twice. Some teams that did not weed the sorghum once were also recorded as weeding twice, and some teams that weeded three or four times were also recorded as weeding twice. This caused great dissatisfaction among the members, affected the members' enthusiasm for labor, and caused great losses to production. Some crops in the fifth production team had not been weeded once in early July, and the cotton seedlings were yellow and thin; the breeder of the fourteenth team did not feed the cattle, starved one cow to death, and left one cow on the mountain, which was drowned by heavy rain. Although the cooperative cadres knew about these serious problems, they always used the excuse of being busy with work and did not go to check and deal with them. Even more seriously, three teams abandoned more than 150 mu of land and did not plant it, and the cooperative did not know about it. This phenomenon is not only a problem existing in the Huai Road cooperative. Leading organs at the county and district levels should organize forces to conduct a serious inspection of the leadership methods of agricultural cooperatives in their respective regions, and propose solutions to the problems.　　Yang Ruchun

### 多多帮助社干部改进领导工作

    多多帮助社干部改进领导工作
    人多不一定好办事
    在农业合作化高潮中，山西屯留县史村建设农业合作社，由原来74户的初级社转成了210户的高级社。扩社升级以后，领导干部在
  “人多好办事”思想的支配下，社里从社长、队长到组长、股长，大小干部共安排了101个，差不多两户就有一个干部。同时，他们又认为：进行社会主义建设，只要不闲着就行。于是终天东奔西跑，大喊大叫；可是，没有解决一点具体问题。去冬和今春这个社在水利建设打井中，就有七个干部（正副社长，队长等）每天从这个井边跑到那个井边，看一看，说一说。结果用一万多个工打的三十眼井，只有十眼管用，其余二十眼都得填了。社员非常不满，他们编了一个顺口溜说：“干部多，嘴太稠，光说话，不动手，领导好比当戏妞。”自转高级社以来，社的办公室里差不多每天都有五、六个干部，有的在算账，有的在争吵，还有的专门在那里扫地打杂。保管员赵成孩，半年来只参加生产小组剔过半天谷苗，可是非生产记工却有112个，而其中在办公室打杂的工又有七十多个。社员反映：当上干部真有福，
  “公房（办公室）站一站，也得四分半。”
    在最近整社中，县委工作组帮助社干部解决了这些问题。他们首先整顿组织，根据社里实际情况，保管出纳各设一人负责管理，不设专门股，组织一个耕畜饲养小组管理牲口，会计员由三人减成两人。管理委员缩减到九个人，这样全社干部只有三十个。接着又帮助社干部检查思想，使他们树立了深入群众的工作作风，并建立了各种必要的制度。经过这样整顿以后，社干部和社员都觉得工作有秩序，事情好办了。社员和社干部的关系也更加亲密了。　　　　　　张学忠
    受补贴的社干部为什么这样多？
    四川璧山县丁家乡沙堆农业生产合作社，共有社员418户，而享有误工补贴待遇的社干部就有294人，这里包括社的正副主任、监察、农业、副业、技术改革、基本建设、文教卫生等委员十九人，生产队正副队长二十四人，队的会计十二人，保管员三十六人，生产组正副组长106人，记分员五十三人，以及保健员、技术员、业余学校教师等，固定补贴工分共计45，860分（实际误工而评定的还未计算在内），将近全社劳动总工分的4％左右。
    受补贴的干部虽然这样多，实际做事的人却很少。前面所说的294人中，就有106个没做实际工作，有的从未参加过社里或队里的会议，有的终天在家里抱娃娃，有的高兴的时候走到田间逛一转。社员见到他们去时，就不满意地说：“逛田坎、拿工分的人又来了。”
    为什么会有这样奇怪的现象呢？原来是有些县、区干部，为了自己业务好搞些，对合作社里属于自己业务部门的社干部，就都要求补贴工分。区妇联副主任曹正芳找到社主任强调说“妇女占人口一半，莫把妇女轻视了。”因此，在她的指使下，全社五十三个妇女干部都得到了补贴工分。区卫生所的干部也急忙跑到合作社说“保健工作很重要，一定要给保健员每天记二分。”县文教科干部对社干部说：
  “扫盲工作越快越好。”于是规定42个业余学校教师每人每天也记两分；还规定教第一册课本的，备课一次评四分，教第二、三册的备课一次评八分到十二分。
    请大家想一想，像这样多的头绪一齐缠在农业社身上，农业社怎么能办得好呢！　　　　　周新茂
    领导农业社不能老是坐在办公室里
    安徽嘉山县古沛乡淮道农业生产合作社社干部天天忙于批条子等事务工作，社里的生产搞得很不好。
    拿耕田、播种、锄田、割麦和栽秧等几项主要农活来说吧，管委会从来就没有组织力量深入队（组）检查验收过一次。平时指导生产习惯于口头号召、会议布置，习惯于坐在办公室里做决定。比如：在夏季预支结算各队（组）工分账目时，社内的几个主任和会计不从实际情况出发，主观决定春种的玉米、高粱不管锄过几次，一律按锄两次记工，有的队高粱一次未锄也给记两次工，有的队锄了三至四次也记两次工。这样便引起社员的极大不满，也影响了社员的劳动积极性，给生产上造成很大的损失。第五生产队七月上旬还有些庄稼一次未锄，棉苗又黄又瘦；十四队的饲养员不给牛吃草，饿死牛一条，把牛丢在山上，被大雨淋死一条。这些严重的问题，社干部虽然知道，但总是借口工作忙，不去检查处理。更严重的是有三个队把土地丢掉一百五十多亩不种，社内还不知道。这种现象不仅是淮道一个社存在的问题。各地县、区领导机关，都应该组织力量，认真地对本地区的农业社的领导方法进行一次检查，提出解决问题的办法。　　杨如春
