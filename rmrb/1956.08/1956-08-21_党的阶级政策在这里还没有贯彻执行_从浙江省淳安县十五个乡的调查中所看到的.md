    The Party's Class Policy Has Not Been Implemented Here
    As Seen from an Investigation of Fifteen Townships in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province
    Mao Hongyuan
    Editor's Note: The investigation conducted by the inspection team organized by the Jian'de Prefectural Committee of Zhejiang Province in Chun'an County is worthy of attention. After the basic realization of agricultural collectivization, the leadership in many areas has paid little attention to the relationship between poor and middle peasants. In fact, even if advanced cooperatives are realized, the issue of the relationship between poor and middle peasants will still need close attention for a considerable period of time. The situation of squeezing out and suppressing poor peasants described in this investigative material also exists elsewhere; the situation of not taking care of the interests of middle peasants also exists in some places. Problems such as relaxing vigilance against landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and the emergence of new forms of exploitation within the community, are all worthy of attention. The situation may be as serious as in Chun'an County in a very small number of cases; however, after the realization of agricultural collectivization, it is necessary for each region to continue to pay attention to changes in the class situation and to conduct a class situation investigation at a certain period.
    In order to prepare for the development of advanced cooperatives after the autumn harvest, the Jian'de Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province organized fifteen inspection teams (a total of 138 people) to go deep into Gangjing, Qiaoxi, and Xin'an, three townships in Chun'an County with relatively good work, Tuoqiao, Chayuan, and five other townships with medium work, and Lishang, Jiukeng, and seven other townships with relatively poor work to check the current agricultural collectivization movement. These townships found that the Party's class policy in rural areas had not been implemented in most cooperatives. In many agricultural cooperatives, poor peasants could not hold their heads high or did not dare to, wealthy peasants held a leading advantage and controlled the real power of the cooperatives; a small number of cooperatives were even manipulated by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements. Therefore, there were chaotic phenomena such as disunity among middle and poor peasants, middle peasants squeezing out poor peasants, wealthy peasants engaging in exploitation within the community, and bad elements spreading rumors and sabotage.
    Among the 3,118 heads and management committee members of 487 cooperatives, current poor peasants and newly lower-middle peasants accounted for 46%; old lower-middle peasants and newly promoted middle peasants accounted for 25%; old upper-middle peasants accounted for 20%; and former landlords, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionaries accounted for 9%. Some villages, fearing that poor peasants would take advantage, organized middle-peasant cooperatives; poor peasants were also dissatisfied and organized poor-peasant cooperatives, and they were mutually opposed. In four villages, including Shuinan and Chayuan, each village had "a pair" of cooperatives, namely, one middle-peasant cooperative and one poor-peasant cooperative. Among them, a cooperative in Shuinan Village, Jinxi Township, as a result of mutual exclusion between middle and poor peasants, was divided into three small cooperatives, which the masses called "middle-peasant cooperative," "dirt-poor cooperative," and "capitalist cooperative." At present, this "capitalist cooperative" has collapsed because the members only care about doing their own business and ignore production within the community.
    In many agricultural cooperatives, poor peasants have been severely hit politically and economically by wealthy peasants and bad elements. For example, Nantanshe in the first village of Tuoqiao Township, proposed "three don'ts" when recruiting members: ① Don't take those with weak labor, ② Don't take those with economic difficulties, ③ Don't take grain-deficient households. In the eighth village of Xiancui Township, all landlords and rich peasants joined the agricultural cooperative, but 127 middle and poor peasant households failed to join. Among them, the poor peasant Zhu Shigui requested to join three times, but was refused. The cooperative cadres said: "Difficult households have no rations, and the community dares not accept them." Xin'an Township, which has a good foundation for collectivization, also has seven cooperatives that have taken various ways to attack poor peasants. For example, the director of Chengzhongshe is a poor peasant and cannot run the family; management committee member Shao Zuliang (middle peasant) lent the community's money to old middle peasants; the poor peasant Ge Zixiang, who is over seventy years old, had difficulty in life and borrowed three yuan from the community, but he did not receive it after running three times. The wealthy middle peasant Shao Jieyou openly scolded the poor peasants: "You rubbish, you shouldn't have been pushed into the community. One day we will sweep you out." Shao Yuntang, a middle peasant who had been a false head of the Baojia system, openly attacked the director of the community, saying: "The director calls for meetings and blows whistles, what's the use!" Another example is that in Dayefan, Jiu Village, Lishang Township, the thirteen households who were excluded and working alone were four households of hired poor peasants who had difficulty in production, and nine households of widowed, orphaned, and childless households without labor. Among them, Ye Linyi (member of the Communist Party of China), a veteran, applied to join the community four times but was not approved. There are also some communities controlled by bad elements and wealthy peasants that attack poor-peasant communities. For example, Yongguangshe (middle-peasant cooperative) in the tenth village of Xin'an Township attacked Hongguangshe (22 members, with 21 poor peasants) in the same village, saying: "Don't be afraid that you are active in production, in the future you will starve so that your two legs are straight."
    In dealing with economic relations, in a large part of the communities, wealthy peasants take advantage and poor peasants suffer losses. In the initial stage of agricultural cooperatives, the fixed remuneration for land and the evaluation of the value of economic crops that are put into the community, the same land, is evaluated higher for middle peasants than for poor peasants. For example, in Yanwoshe, Gangkou Township, the tea output of middle peasants is on average 10% higher than that of poor peasants. Mo Shikui, a middle peasant, could only pick 350 catties of tea from a mountain, but it was evaluated as 470 catties; Hong Xiaosi, a poor peasant, could pick 280 catties of tea from a tea mountain, but it was only evaluated as 220 catties. This situation exists in townships that produce tea such as Mocuan and Lishang. The depreciation of cattle and farm implements is generally more reasonable in cooperatives led by poor peasants, and the main bias is that middle peasants raise prices. In the production fee and equity fund of each community in Gangkou Township, all the poor peasants have paid in full, but most of the middle peasants have not paid. After the middle peasants depreciate the value of the cattle and farm implements put into the community to offset the public ownership shares, the surplus can be returned in installments, but the middle peasants want to take all the production fee and equity fund borrowed by the poor peasants to pay off the debts. As a result, most of the production fee and equity fund borrowed by the poor peasants were given to the middle peasants. Another example is Xinguangshe in Xin'an Township. The deputy director (middle peasant) put a cow into the community, the normal price is 120 yuan, but he insisted on depreciating it to 130 yuan, and asked the community to pay off the price within one year; the members did not agree, and he criticized them for being "selfish."
    According to the understanding in fifteen townships, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries were all absorbed into the community without distinction. Before being absorbed, there was no discussion among the masses, and after being absorbed, no different situations were handled separately. Lu Wenkui, a counter-revolutionary element under control, controlled Jiansheshe in Jiu Village, Chayuan Township. Lu is a counter-revolutionary element with bloody debts and deserves to be shot; due to his surrender and confession, he handed over eleven guns and was sentenced to control. After joining the community, he bought off the militia captain and the head of the community and treated him as a formal member. According to the investigation of the tenth village of Lishang Township, Yao Hongqing, a landlord element, and Shang Qitian, a rich peasant element, organized a cooperative with some old middle peasants; Shang Qitian was also made a "township labor model," but in fact, he only worked fifty workdays in the community in five months, which has a very bad influence among the masses. Zheng Futang, a rich peasant in Tuoqiao Township, was asked by the community to cut old wheat by the creek, but he went to the mountain to cut tender wheat. After a reactionary landlord in the sixth village of Gangkou Township, who had been an executive member of the Kuomintang district branch, joined the community, he obtained the qualification of a "formal member" and tried his best to sabotage the community.
    The phenomenon of exploitation by employing workers in a small number of township cooperatives is also very serious. In the Xinjianshe of Mocuan Township, middle peasant members all hire short-term workers. Liu Zushou, a middle peasant member, hired a long-term worker and a short-term worker to engage in exploitation. Similar situations have also occurred in some communities in Lishang Township. The exploitation method is that members pay to hire cheap short-term workers from outside the community (generally only six or seven days at a time), and the community records the labor work points in the name of the employer.
    The leadership of district and township cadres over agricultural production cooperatives is not specific, the style is generally general, satisfied with meeting leadership, and lacks meticulous and specific leadership. Some cadres cannot find the problems existing in the cooperatives; some do not know how to solve the problems after they are discovered, so they "bypass the cooperatives." According to the statistics of 360 communities in nine townships including Heyang, 130 communities have special personnel responsible for district and township cadres, accounting for 36%; 158 communities have district and township cadres visiting without solving problems, accounting for 44%; 72 communities have no cadres visiting, accounting for 20%. Due to the lack of in-depth leadership, a large number of community-run cadres still do not understand how to run the community. According to the statistics of 128 district and township cadres in eleven townships including Chayuan, only 35 really understand how to run the community, 53 are half-understanding, and 40 still do not understand how to run the community. In Jin'feng Township, District Chief Liang said to the first community: I don't have time, I want to go to the second community to solve the problem; when he arrived at the second community, he said again: I don't have time, I want to go to the third community to solve the problem. In fact, there are many problems in the cooperative, but he just "bypasses the community" and does not solve them.
    After the inspection team organized by the prefectural committee discovered these problems, it aroused the attention of the county party committee. Now, the county is solving these problems in the process of rectifying the community.

### 党的阶级政策在这里还没有贯彻执行  从浙江省淳安县十五个乡的调查中所看到的

    党的阶级政策在这里还没有贯彻执行
    从浙江省淳安县十五个乡的调查中所看到的
    毛洪元
    编者按：浙江省建德地委组织的检查组在淳安县所作的调查很值得注意。在基本上实现了农业合作化以后，许多地区的领导方面对于贫农中农之间的关系问题不大注意了。实际上，即使实现了高级合作化，贫农中农关系的问题，在相当长时期内仍然是需要密切注意的。像这个调查材料中叙述的排挤和压抑贫农的情况，在别的地方也有；不照顾中农利益的情况，在一些地方也存在着。对地主富农分子和反革命分子放松警惕、社内出现新的剥削形式等问题，都值得注意。情况像淳安县这样严重的可能是极少数；但是，在实现农业合作化以后继续注意阶级情况的变化，在一定时期作一次阶级情况的调查，对于每个地区都是必要的。
    中共浙江省建德地委为了作好秋收后发展高级合作社的准备工作，组织了十五个检查组（共一百三十八人），深入淳安县港井、桥西、新安三个工作较好的乡，妥桥、茶园等五个工作中等的乡，里商、鸠坑等七个工作比较不好的乡，检查了当前农业合作化运动中的问题。在这些乡发现：党在农村中的阶级政策，在大部分合作社没有贯彻执行。在不少农业社里，贫农抬不起头或不敢抬头，富裕农民占领导优势，掌握合作社的实权；少数合作社甚至被地主、富农、反革命分子和别的坏分子操纵。因此，出现了中贫农闹不团结，中农排挤贫农，富裕农民在社内进行剥削，坏分子造谣破坏等混乱现象。
    在四百八十七个社的三千一百一十八个社长、管理委员当中，现贫农同新下中农占46％；老下中农新上中农占25％；老上中农占20％；原地主、富农分子及反革命分子占9％。有些村中农怕贫农揩油，就组织了中农社；贫农也不服气，就组织了贫农社，互相对立。水南、茶园等四个村，每村都有“一对”合作社，即一个中农社、一个贫农社。其中锦溪乡水南村有一个社，因中贫农互相排斥的结果，分成三个小社，群众称之为“中农社”、“赤贫社”、“资本主义社”。目前，这个“资本主义社”因为社员只顾自己做生意不管社内生产，已经垮台。
    在不少农业社里，贫农在政治上经济上受到富裕农民及坏分子的严重打击。如妥桥乡第一村南坦社，吸收社员的时候提出“三不要”：①劳力弱的不要，②经济困难的不要，③缺粮户不要。闲萃乡八村地主富农全部参加了农业社，中贫农倒有一百二十七户未能入社。其中贫农朱士贵三次要求参加，都遭到拒绝。社干部说：“困难户没有口粮，社里不敢接受。”合作化基础好的新安乡，也有七个社采取各种各样方式打击贫农。例如：城中社主任是贫农，当不了家；管理委员邵祖良（中农）把社里的钱借给老中农；七十多岁的贫农葛子相生活困难，向社借支三元钱，跑了三次都没有支到。富裕中农邵结有当面骂贫农：“你们这些垃圾，不应该推到社里来。总有一天把你们扫出去。”当过伪保长的中农邵云堂公开打击社主任，说：“主任叫叫开会，吹吹哨子，有鸟用！”又如：里商乡九村大叶畈被排斥在外面单干的十三户，四户是生产有困难的雇贫农，九户是无劳力的鳏寡孤独户，内有转业军人叶林宜（中共党员）四次要求参加社，没有得到批准。也有一些坏分子及富裕农民操纵的社，打击贫农社。如新安乡十村永光社（中农社）打击同村红光社（二十二户社员，有二十一户贫农），说：“不怕你们生产积极，将来要二只脚饿得笔直。
    在经济关系问题的处理上，有很大一部分社富裕农民占便宜，贫农吃亏。初级社土地固定报酬及经济作物入社评产，同样的土地，对中农的评的比贫农的高。如港口乡燕窝社，茶叶定产中农比贫农平均高10％。中农莫石奎的一块山只能采茶叶350斤，评产评成470斤；贫农洪小四一块茶山能采茶叶280斤，评产只评了220斤。莫川、里商等出产茶叶的乡都有这种情况。耕牛农具折价，贫农掌握领导的社一般比较合理，主要偏向是中农抬高价格。港口乡各社生产费股份基金，贫农全部交清，中农多数还没有交。中农折价入社的耕牛农具抵交公有化股份金后，多余的本可分期还给，但是中农却要把贫农基金贷款全拿来还账。结果，贫农贷来的生产费股份基金大部分都给了中农。又如新安乡新光社，副主任（中农）入社的耕牛，正常价格一百二十元，他硬要折价一百三十元，并要社里一年还清价款；社员不同意，被他批评为“自私自利”。
    据在十五个乡了解，地主、富农、反革命分子都被不加分别一律吸收入社，吸收以前没经过群众讨论，吸收了以后又没有分别不同情况进行处理。茶园乡九村建设社，被被管制的反革命分子陆文奎掌握。陆是血债累累的反革命分子，罪该枪决；由于自首坦白，交出了十一支枪，改判管制。他入社后收买民兵队长及社长，把他当作正式社员看。据里商乡十村的调查，这个村的地主分子姚洪清、富农分子商其田，同一些老中农组织了一个合作社；商其田还被弄成了“乡劳动模范”，实际上入社五个月只在社里做过五十工，在群众中影响很坏。妥桥乡富农郑富堂，社里叫他到溪边割老麦，他偏偏跑到山上去割嫩麦。港口乡六村一个反动地主、做过国民党区分部执行委员的人入社后取得了“正式社员”资格，在社内极力进行破坏。
    少数乡合作社雇工剥削的现象也很严重。莫川乡新建社中农社员都雇短工。中农社员刘祖寿雇了一个长工、一个短工，进行剥削。里商乡有些社也发生了类似情况，剥削方式是社员出钱雇社外便宜的短工（一般雇一次只做六、七天），社里把劳动工分记到雇主名下。
    区乡干部对农业生产合作社的领导不具体，作风一般化，满足于会议领导，缺乏细致具体的领导。有的干部对合作社里存在的问题发现不了；有的问题发现后不知道该怎么解决，就“绕开合作社走”。据合洋等九个乡三百六十个社统计，有区乡干部专人负责的社有一百三十个，占36％；区乡干部走马看花去而不解决问题的有158个社，占44％；没有干部去过的社七十二个，占20％。由于领导不深入，大批办社干部到现在还不懂得办社。据茶园等十一个乡一百二十八个区乡干部的统计，真正懂得办社的只有三十五个，半懂不懂的五十三个，现在还不懂办社的四十个。在金峰乡，梁区长到第一社说：我没有工夫，要到第二社去解决问题；到了第二社，又说：没有工夫，要到第三社去解决问题。实际上是：合作社里的问题很多，他偏偏“绕开社走”，不去解决。
    地委组织的检查组发现了这些问题以后，才引起了县委的重视。现在，这个县正在整社工作中解决这些问题。
