    The Bisezhai to Hekou section of the Dian-Vietnam Railway was opened to traffic in 1909. It suffered severe damage during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and all the rails along the line were dismantled.

    滇越铁路一段开始修复
    据新华社讯　滇越铁路碧色寨到河口段的线路修复工程，已经全面施工；碧色寨至芷村段的铺轨工程也已开始。这段铁路修复以后，将便于和越南民主共和国已经通车的河内到老街的铁路相衔接。
    滇越铁路碧色寨到河口段铁路，曾在1909年通车。在抗日战争时期，遭到了严重破坏，沿线铁轨全被拆除。
