    Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Eden and military authorities ordered on August 10th to postpone again the large-scale military deployment to the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. The airlift of elite infantry to the Suez area has been ordered to be delayed for 24 hours. Some troop transport ships have also halted their operations. In addition, Britain announced that it would withdraw two battalions of paratroopers from the Middle East.

    The British authorities also issued an order on August 9th regarding the "postponement" of military deployments. On this day, the British Ministry of Defence cancelled British Overseas Airways Corporation's decision to airlift 3,000 soldiers to Libya, scheduled for the early morning of August 10th. At the same time, the troop transport ship "Empire Knowledge," carrying an anti-aircraft artillery unit, decided to postpone its departure. The 22,000-ton aircraft carrier "Fortress," carrying sufficient jet aircraft, also stopped at Gibraltar on its way to Cyprus and entered dry dock.

    British officials did not explain the reasons for the sudden slowdown in strengthening military forces in the Mediterranean. However, according to Associated Press reporter Gaver, this "slowdown" by Britain was taken "at a time when worldwide anxiety about the possibility of war has increased," and "under the increasing pressure for a peaceful resolution of the Suez crisis." United Press International pointed out that this postponement was related to Indian Prime Minister Nehru's criticism of Western military measures. It also pointed out that Libya's determination not to allow British reinforcements to land was also a reason why Britain had to postpone its military deployment.

    Although the British authorities made this indication of a "slowdown" in action, the British Ministry of Defence issued a statement on the evening of August 9th stating that the British government's intention to take "preventive military measures" to deal with Egypt's policy of reclaiming the Suez Canal had not changed.

    在全世界要求和平解决苏彝士运河问题压力下
    英国政府再次延缓增兵中东
    新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登和军事当局在八月十日下令再次推迟向地中海和中东地区的大规模军事调动。向苏彝士地区空运精锐步兵一事已经奉令延缓二十四小时。一些运兵船也停止了行动。此外，英国还宣布，要从中东撤回两营伞兵。
    英国当局在八月九日也发出过关于“推迟”军事调动的命令。这一天，英国国防部撤销了英国海外航空公司把预定在八月十日清晨空运三千名士兵到利比亚去的决定。同时，载有一个高射炮队的运兵船“帝国知识号”决定延期出航。载有足数的喷气飞机的二万二千吨的航空母舰“堡垒号”也在赶赴塞浦路斯的途中停留在直布罗陀，并且开进了干船坞。
    英国官方没有解释突然放慢增强地中海军事力量的原因。但是，据美联社记者加弗向指出，英国这种“放慢”的行动，是“在全世界对于战争爆发的可能性感到的不安有了增长的时候，”“在日益增长的、要求和平解决苏彝士危机的压力下”采取的。合众社消息指出了这次推延和印度总理尼赫鲁抨击西方军事措施有关。它还指出，利比亚决心不让英国增援部队着陆，这也是英国不得不推迟它的军事调动的一个原因。
    虽然英国当局作出了这种“放慢”行动的表示。英国国防部八月九日晚间又发表声明说英国政府要采取“预防性军事措施”来对付埃及收回苏彝士运河的政策并没有改变。
