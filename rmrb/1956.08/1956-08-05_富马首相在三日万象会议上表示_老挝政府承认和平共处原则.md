Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th: According to Vientiane Radio, Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said at the Vientiane Conference on the 3rd that his government recognizes the Five Principles. He pointed out that the Kingdom government has established relations with many countries and also has connections with China. Premier Zhou Enlai has also invited him to visit China. These relationships prove that Laos is taking a neutral path.

Phouma then said that there are currently some foreigners in Lao territory. However, when we no longer need them, we can ask them to leave.

At the Vientiane Conference on the 3rd, Phouma responded to the five agenda suggestions made by Prince Souphanouvong, head of the Lao Fighting Units delegation, including the issues of neutrality and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

In response to other suggestions, Phouma said that regarding the rights of the Lao Fighting Units, they will enjoy all rights when they return to live together in the country. He also said that the Lao Patriotic Front will be considered a political party operating openly.

Phouma also stated that the relevant departments of the Kingdom are conducting research on realizing the people's free and democratic rights, and are also studying the issue of elections, with the number of deputies possibly increasing. Phouma affirmed that the Kingdom's elections are held in accordance with the constitution, every four years.

Souphanouvong announced that he would pay attention to the opinions of the Kingdom government delegation and study them. He said that if major issues can be resolved in principle, minor issues can also be resolved.

The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 4th.

According to Vientiane Radio, the Lao Kingdom government held an important cabinet meeting on the 2nd to thoroughly study and discuss the five agenda suggestions of the Lao Fighting Units, and decided on the Lao government's position on these suggestions.
