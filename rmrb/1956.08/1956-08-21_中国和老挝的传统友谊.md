    The Traditional Friendship Between China and Laos
    Chen Yulong

    Laos is our southern neighbor, and our two peoples have a long-standing traditional friendship.

    The border between China and Laos stretches for more than 500 kilometers. The Lancang River, which originates in southwestern China, meanders south through Laos, Cambodia, and into the sea in southern Vietnam (the Lancang River is called the Mekong River within Indochina). This river irrigates the fertile lands of both China and Laos, nourishes the people of both countries, and facilitates friendly exchanges between the two peoples.

    According to the records of ancient books such as the "Book of the Later Han," "New Book of the Tang," "Chronicles of Huayang," and "Unofficial History of Nanzhao," as early as the Later Han Dynasty (1st century AD) and the Tang Dynasty, the Chinese people had friendly exchanges with the ancient ethnic groups living in the area of Laos, and had some understanding of the local mountains, rivers, products, customs, and habits. The records in these ancient books mark the long history of friendship between the Chinese and Lao peoples, and are valuable documents for studying the ancient history of Laos and the relationship between China and Laos.

    In 857 AD, the Lao people began to establish a prosperous and strong country in Meng Zhao (now Luang Prabang). By the 13th century, Laos was one of the centers of civilization in Southeast Asia. In the hundreds of years that followed, the friendly exchanges between China and Laos became increasingly frequent.

    In the relevant historical records of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese historians already used the current name of Laos ("Laos") or "Nan Zhang." The Qing Dynasty continued to use the name "Nan Zhang." According to the Lao language, "Nan Zhang" means "Land of a Million Elephants."

    The "History of the Ming Dynasty" records many events of friendly exchanges between China and Laos. In 1403 (the first year of the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty), when Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty ascended the throne, Laos sent envoys to present local products; in 1407, 1408, and 1409, they sent people to present gifts such as elephants, horses, rhinoceros, and gold and silver utensils. In 1409, Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty also sent the eunuch Yang Lin to return gifts of silk fabrics. After that, Lao envoys came to China for visits every year, and the Ming Dynasty government treated them with courtesy. During the reigns of Xuande, Jingtai, Hongzhi, and Jiajing, Lao envoys visiting China continued to arrive.

    During the Qing Dynasty, there were still frequent exchanges between the two countries. In 1729 (the seventh year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty), King Dao Sun of Nan Zhang sent envoys to deliver to the Qing government a gilded Burmese-script book written on palm leaves, along with two trained elephants. The envoys passed through Pu'er in Yunnan and traveled to Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and other places to enter Beijing, and people were sent to escort them along the way. The following year (1730), Laos sent envoys to pay a visit again. In 1736 (the first year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty), the Qing Dynasty government presented King Dao Sun of Nan Zhang with gifts such as colored silk fabrics. In 1749 and 1761, Laos sent envoys to China twice, presenting many trained elephants. In 1782 (the forty-seventh year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty), Lao envoys Ba Zhenghong and others arrived in Beijing, and the Qing Dynasty government hosted a banquet in the Sanwusi Hall of the Ziguang Pavilion and returned gifts such as tea and fruits. In 1795 (the sixtieth year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty), King Zhao Wenmeng of Laos sent envoys to present a volume of the Longevity Sutra and other gifts. Later, in 1799 (the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign) and 1807 (the twelfth year of the Jiaqing reign), Laos sent envoys to renew friendship, and the Qing Dynasty government treated them with courtesy.

    Along with these friendly exchanges, the economic and cultural exchanges between the two peoples became increasingly close.

    From the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty (1403-1424), some Chinese began to reside in Laos. They lived in harmony with the local people and played a role in exchanging production knowledge and cultural arts. According to some historical records, the Lao people's "methods of making wine and spirits, and raising silkworms" were introduced from China. The bronze drums used by residents in some parts of Laos are very similar to the bronze drums used by various ethnic minorities in Lingnan, China, which is also one of the proofs of the close economic and cultural exchanges between the two peoples. Trade activities between the Chinese and Lao peoples have been very active throughout history. Residents in our border areas often exchanged goods such as salt, tobacco, and textiles with the Lao people for forest products such as benzoin and rattan. The bamboo smoking pipes produced in Laos are comparable to those produced in Yunnan, China, and have long been loved by the Chinese people. The rosewood produced in Laos can be used to make exquisite furniture, which has long been popular among the Chinese people.

    The Lao people are devout Buddhists, and Buddhism has also been spread in China for a long time. Buddhist culture has also played a role in promoting the traditional friendship between the two peoples throughout history.

    Chinese historians have made many vivid praises and descriptions of Laos' long-standing civilization and abundant products. For example, the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty" describes the situation of Luang Prabang in Laos: "The city is at the foot of the mountain, where the Nam Khan River (and the Mekong River) meet, and the water flows through the city. The royal palace is in the north of the city, with houses built against the mountain, and the scale is magnificent. Buddhist tombs, temples, and pagodas stand in the city. There are many gardens on both sides of the river... Its products include various metal mines. The rice includes both japonica and glutinous rice. There are many corn, few millet and wheat. There are indigo, lacquer, rattan, bamboo, hemp, cotton, coconut leaves, palmyra palm, sugar cane, betel nut, cardamom, tobacco leaves, sesame, peanuts, and pine and oak trees are especially abundant..."

    The above facts show that the economic and cultural ties between China and Laos in history are very close, and the traditional friendship between the two peoples is very deep. The two peoples have always exchanged what they have for what they need, and have been friendly and mutually helpful.

    However, in the past hundred years, both China and Laos have been subjected to colonialist aggression, which has artificially hindered the friendly exchanges between the two peoples, but the connection between each other, especially in terms of spirit and emotion, has not been severed because of this hindrance. The two peoples have always sympathized with each other in the struggle against colonialism. During the Second World War, the two peoples fought side by side against Japanese fascism. During the Indochina War, the Chinese people showed great sympathy and concern for the suffering of the Lao people and the external interference they encountered. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai, head of the Chinese delegation, had friendly contact with the delegation of the Kingdom of Laos. During the Bandung Conference, the Chinese delegation and the delegation of the Kingdom of Laos also had cordial meetings, conveying the friendly feelings of the two peoples.

    Now, the visit of the delegation of the Royal Lao Government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, to our country for a friendly visit marks that the friendly relations between China and Laos have entered a new historical stage. Through this friendly visit, the traditional friendship between the two peoples will surely be further consolidated and developed, and the peaceful and friendly exchanges between the two countries will surely be closer.

    中国和老挝的传统友谊
    陈玉龙
    老挝是我国南邻的国家，我们两国人民有着长久的传统友谊。
    我国和老挝的国境相连达五百多公里。发源于我国西南的澜沧江，蜿蜒曲折地南下流经老挝、柬埔寨至越南南部入海（澜沧江到了印度支那境内后就称做湄公河）。这一条河流灌溉着中、老两国肥美的土地，滋养着两国的人民，也便利了两国人民的友好往来。
    根据“后汉书”、“新唐书”、“华阳国志”、“南诏野史”等古籍的记载，早在后汉（公元一世纪）和唐代，我国人民就已和居住在老挝一带的古代民族有友好的来往，对于当地的山川物产、风土人情有所了解。这些古籍的记载，标志着中、老两国人民历史友谊的悠久，而且是研究老挝古代历史和中老两国系关史的珍贵文献。
    公元857年，老挝人民在孟兆（今琅勃剌邦）开始建立起一个繁荣昌盛的国家。到十三世纪，老挝是当时东南亚的文明中心之一。此后数百年间，中、老两国的友好来往就日益频繁了。
    在明代有关的史籍上，我国史家已称老挝的今名（“老挝”）或称“南掌”。清代仍沿用“南掌”的称呼。照老挝语言来解释，“南掌”含有“万象之邦”的意思。
    “明史”里面记载着中、老两国友好往来的许多事迹。1403年（明永乐元年）明成祖即位，老挝曾派使者赠送方物；1407年、1408年、1409年均曾派人来赠送象、马、犀、金银器皿等礼物，明成祖在1409年也派中官杨琳回赠文绮。此后，老挝连年皆有使者聘问中国，明朝政府均优礼酬答。宣德、景泰、弘治和嘉靖年间，聘问中国的老挝使臣仍不绝于途。
    到了清朝，两国之间仍有不断的往来。1729年（清雍正七年），南掌国王岛孙派遣使臣致送清朝政府销金缅字编蒲国书一道，驯象二只，使臣经云南普洱转往贵州、湖南、湖北、河南等处入京，沿途各地均派人护送。次年（1730年），老挝又派使臣前来聘问。1736年（清乾隆元年），清朝政府曾赠送南掌国王岛孙彩缎文绮等礼物。1749年和1761年，老挝曾两次遣使来中国，赠送驯象多只。1782年（清乾隆四十七年）老挝使臣叭整哄等四人到北京，清朝政府曾在紫光阁三无私殿设宴接待，并回赠茶果等礼物。1795年（清乾隆六十年），老挝国王召温猛派遣使臣送来长生经一卷和其他礼物。以后在1799年（清嘉庆四年）和1807年（清嘉庆十二年），老挝又先后遣使来修好，清朝政府也优礼酬答。
    随着这些友好往来，两国人民在经济、文化方面的交流也日益密切了。
    从明朝永乐年间（1403—1424年）起，就有一些中国人开始侨居老挝。他们与当地人民和睦相处，在交换生产知识和文化艺术方面，起了一定的作用。据某些史籍的记载，老挝人民的“制酒醴养蚕丝之法”，是从我国介绍过去的。老挝一些地方的居民使用的铜鼓，与我国岭南各少数民族所使用的铜鼓很类似，这也是两国人民经济文化交往密切的证明之一。中老两国人民之间的贸易活动，在历史上是很活跃的。我国边境居民常以盐、烟草、纺织品等货物和老挝人民交换安息香、藤等林产品。老挝出产的竹制烟筒与我国云南的出产品媲美，早就为我国人民所喜爱。老挝出产的红木可制精美家具，很早就深受我国人民的欢迎。
    老挝人民笃信佛教，佛教在我国也传播久远。佛教文化在促进两国人民历史上的传统友谊方面，也起了它的作用。
    我国史家们对于老挝悠久的文明和丰富的物产，曾有许多生动的赞扬和描述。例如，“清史稿”中描写老挝隆勃剌邦（即琅勃剌邦）的情形说：“城在山下，当南冈江（和湄公河）会流处，水穿城而过。王宫在城之北，背山建屋，规制壮丽。佛墓寺塔，森立城市中。濒江两岸多花园。……其物产有五金各矿。稻则有粳有糯。多包谷、少粟麦。有靛青、漆、藤、竹、麻、棉、椰叶、桄榔、甘蔗、槟榔、豆蔻、烟叶、芝麻、花生，而松木、楢木尤多……。”
    以上的事实说明，中国和老挝在历史上的经济与文化的联系是非常密切的，两国人民之间的传统友谊是非常深厚的。两国人民向来就是有无相通、友爱互助的。
    但是，近百年来，中国和老挝都曾受到殖民主义者的侵略，这就使得两国人民的友好往来受到人为的阻碍，但彼此之间的联系特别是精神和感情方面的联系，并没有因为这种阻碍而断绝。两国人民在反对殖民主义的斗争中，一直是相互同情的。在第二次世界大战年代中，两国人民曾经并肩作战，共同抵抗日本法西斯。在印度支那战争期间，中国人民对老挝人民所受的战争苦难以及所遇到的外力干涉寄予很大的同情和关怀。在1954年日内瓦会议上，我国代表团团长周恩来总理与老挝王国代表团曾经有过友好的接触。在万隆会议期间，我国代表团和老挝王国代表团也有过亲切的会晤，传达了两国人民的友好感情。
    现在，以老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府代表团到我国来进行友好访问，更标志着中国和老挝的友好关系进入了一个新的历史阶段。通过这次友好访问，两国人民的传统友谊必将日益得到巩固与发展，两国之间的和平友好往来也一定会更加密切。（附图片）
