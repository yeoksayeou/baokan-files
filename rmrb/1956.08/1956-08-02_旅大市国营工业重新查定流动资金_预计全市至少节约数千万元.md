    Lüda City State-Owned Industries Reassess Working Capital
    Expected Savings of at Least Tens of Millions of Yuan Citywide
    (Our Dalian News) Lüda City's state-owned and locally state-owned industries have begun reassessing their working capital quotas. Preliminary estimates suggest that this reassessment will save the city at least tens of millions of yuan in working capital.
    For several years, the working capital quotas for Lüda City's state-owned and locally state-owned industries have been too high, with working capital increasing at a much faster rate than production. According to statistics from nineteen state-owned factories, the total value of production in 1955 increased by only 58.3% compared to 1951, while the working capital quota increased by 88.2%. According to statistics from twenty-eight factories under the Lüda City Industrial Bureau, the total value of production in 1955 increased by only 53.9% compared to 1952, while the working capital quota increased by 114.7%. This abnormal proportional relationship, where the increase in working capital quotas exceeds the increase in the total value of production, means that a large amount of capital is being stockpiled and wasted. According to statistics from twenty-two state-owned factories, materials exceeding the quota stockpiled by the end of 1955 amounted to 35 million yuan, and more than 26 million yuan in funds were idle and unused. For example, the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory had a surplus of 3.54 million yuan in funds left over from the fourth quarter of last year, while its production plan was completed by 152.7%. Due to the abundance of funds, this factory, despite stockpiling a lot of materials, could often avoid borrowing from banks.
    Since the third quarter of last year, many factories have revised their working capital plan quotas based on instructions from higher-level management agencies. As a result, working capital has been reduced to some extent. According to statistics from twelve state-owned factories in Dalian City alone, more than 16 million yuan was reduced. When drawing up plans this year, most factories have also paid attention to implementing the principle of saving funds. For example, for the aforementioned twelve factories, although the total value of production increased by 22.4% compared to last year, working capital increased by only 3.8%. This shows that certain achievements have already been made in saving working capital.
    However, this does not mean that there is no more potential to be tapped in saving working capital. For example, the Dalian Steel Plant had reduced its working capital twice, and after reassessing it in May with the assistance of the Lüda City branch of the People's Bank of China, it further reduced its working capital by more than 3 million yuan while ensuring normal production. In the same month, the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory also reduced its working capital by more than 3 million yuan after reassessment. Preliminary estimates suggest that the working capital of factories in Lüda City is generally at least 15% too high. This means that the working capital saved from twenty factories could reduce the state's investment in the working capital needed for three larger factories. Therefore, tapping the potential of working capital is a very meaningful task.
    The CPC Lüda City Committee believes that this situation of high working capital quotas and the stockpiling and waste of funds is a common phenomenon in all factories in the city. Therefore, it has decided to conduct a comprehensive working capital quota reassessment in all state-owned and locally state-owned industries in the city, so as to limit working capital to the minimum required for normal production. This work is now under the direct leadership of the CPC Lüda City Committee, with the mobilization of self-assessment by state-owned factories, assisted by units such as the People's Bank of China. The Lüda City Local Industry Working Capital Reassessment Central Group, jointly formed by the Lüda City Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Lüda City Industrial Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and other relevant departments, is specifically leading the reassessment of various factories in local industry.
    Currently, the reassessment work of the first batch of seven state-owned factories and five locally state-owned factories has begun, and other factories are also actively preparing to proceed. It is expected that this work will be completed by the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter.

### 旅大市国营工业重新查定流动资金  预计全市至少节约数千万元

    旅大市国营工业重新查定流动资金
    预计全市至少节约数千万元
    本报大连讯　旅大市国营和地方国营工业开始重新查定流动资金的定额。据初步估计，通过这次查定，全市至少可以节约数千万元的流动资金。
    几年来，旅大市国营和地方国营工业的流动资金定额是偏高的，流动资金增长的速度远远超过生产增长的速度。据十九个国营工厂统计，生产总值1955年只比1951年增长58.3％，而流动资金定额却增长了88.2％。据旅大市工业局二十八个厂统计，生产总值1955年比1952年只增长53.9％，而流动资金定额却增长了114.7％。这种流动资金定额增长大于生产总值增长的不正常比例关系，意味着大量资金被积压浪费。据二十二个国营工厂统计，1955年末超定额积压的物资就有三千五百万元，另外还有二千六百多万元的资金闲置未用。像大连工矿车辆厂去年第四季度用剩的资金有三百五十四万元，而生产计划却完成了152.7％。由于资金充裕，虽然这个工厂积压了很多物资，却还能经常不向银行借款。
    自去年第三季度以来，很多工厂根据上级管理机关的指示，修订了流动资金计划定额。因此，流动资金有了一定程度的削减。仅据大连市十二个国营工厂统计，就减少了一千六百多万元。今年各厂在订计划的时候，多数工厂也都注意贯彻执行节约资金的原则。如上述十二个工厂，今年生产总值虽然比去年增加了22.4％，但是流动资金只增加3.8％。这说明在节约流动资金方面已经取得了一定的成绩。
    但是，这并不是说节约流动资金就没有什么潜力可挖了。如大连钢厂曾经两次削减流动资金，五月份在人民银行旅大市分行的协助下重新查定后，又在保证生产正常进行的原则下，削减了流动资金三百多万元。同月份，大连工矿车辆厂经过查定，也削减了流动资金三百多万元。据初步估计，旅大市各厂流动资金大约至少偏高15％。这就是说，从二十个工厂节约下来的流动资金，就可以使国家减少对三个较大的工厂所需流动资金的投资。因此，挖掘流动资金的潜力，是一件非常有意义的工作。
    中共旅大市委认为这种流动资金定额偏高，积压和浪费资金的情况是全市各厂的普遍现象，因此决定在全市国营和地方国营工业中普遍进行流动资金定额查定工作，以便把流动资金限制在正常生产的最低限度需要上。现在这一工作正在中共旅大市委直接领导下，发动各国营工厂自查，由人民银行等单位协助；并且由人民银行旅大市分行、旅大市工业局、财政局等有关部门联合组成了旅大市地方工业流动资金查定中心组，具体领导地方工业各厂进行查定。
    目前，全市第一批七个国营工厂和五个地方国营工厂的查定工作已经开始，其余各厂也在积极准备进行。预计这一工作在第三季度末和第四季度初可全部结束。
