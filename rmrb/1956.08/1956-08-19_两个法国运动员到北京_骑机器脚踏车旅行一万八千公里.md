    据新华社18日讯　法国体育杂志“路和跑道”的编辑安·福龙同他十八岁的伙伴、机械师让·纳斯卢，骑着机器脚踏车经过一万八千公里的长途跋涉，在昨天骑着机器脚踏车到达北京。这两位法国运动员今年四月三日离开巴黎，经过西德、民主德国、波、捷、匈、南、希、土、伊朗、阿富汗、巴基斯坦、印度和缅甸，在八月三日抵达昆明。
    他们的旅行工具是一种时速四十五公里、重量不到八十磅的机器脚踏车。这种车在没有燃料的时候，还可以用脚踏动前进。
    他们打算在北京游览一个星期，然后取道乌兰巴托和莫斯科返巴黎。全部乘机器脚踏车的行程将达到三万公里左右。安·福龙说，他们是第一次用这种轻型的机器脚踏车作这样长途旅行的两个人。
