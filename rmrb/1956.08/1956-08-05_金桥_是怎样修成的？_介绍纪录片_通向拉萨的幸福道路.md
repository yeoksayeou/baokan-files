How Was the "Golden Bridge" Built?
—Introducing the Documentary "The Road to Happiness Leading to Lhasa"
Su Fang

The snow-covered mountains are so beautiful, and the calm lake water is so clear; in the boundless fields, the wheat ears sway in the wind, and on the vast grasslands, herds of cattle and sheep come and go. This is the beautiful and prosperous Tibet. For a long time, transportation between Tibet and the interior of the motherland was blocked, and the Tibetan people could not receive more help from the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, nor could they improve their lives more quickly. In order to change this situation, and to better help the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, we built the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, known by the Tibetan people as the "Golden Bridge," creating an unprecedented miracle. "The Road to Happiness Leading to Lhasa" is a large-scale color documentary recording the construction of these two highways. With fairly vivid pictures, this film truthfully reflects the heroic acts of the road-building soldiers, workers, and Tibetan laborers fighting against nature, especially the magnificent spirit of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who participated in the road construction work as early as 1950, making "high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way."

The high mountains and turbulent rivers of Tibet once frightened many travelers and explorers. The book "A Complete Account of Tibet" published in 1930 described Tibet's transportation as: "Boulders lie in disorder, roads for people and horses are cut off, dangers and difficulties abound, beyond description"; "No one in the world who comes here does not tremble with fear." But our road-building heroes climbed this "roof of the world," rarely visited by humans, and fought against nature with overwhelming power! From the film, we saw many touching things: the roaring Nujiang River was difficult to cross; but in order to erect a cableway on the river to transport food and people, soldiers Li Wenyan, Cui Ximing, and their comrades drove a small rubber boat and charged through the raging waves. In order to go to a new construction site, soldiers grabbed ropes and climbed step by step up the cliffs where even wild goats could hardly gain a foothold... Work was hard, and life was equally hard! The film uses humorous artistic techniques to highlight this situation through one or two scenes: the soldiers on Mount Que'er got up, but the shoes in front of the bed were frozen to the ground, and it took a lot of effort to pull the shoes off the ground and put them on! And the humorous commentary "I really didn't expect it would be difficult to get up here" also strengthened the expressiveness and appeal of this shot. We also saw the soldiers resting: they were engrossed in looking at picture albums, happily playing the flute, and concentrating on playing chess. These scenes clearly tell us: they have a high degree of revolutionary optimism, they have an indelible fighting will, and they will never bow their heads to difficulties!

The film devotes considerable space to showing the care and support of the Tibetan local government and the Tibetan people for the road construction project. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni both came to the construction site to express their condolences to the road construction troops and laborers, and the Dalai Lama personally went to the tomb of martyr Zhang Fulin to offer prayers. The young Tibetan girl, Qumei Bazhen, worked tirelessly to transport materials for the road builders, driving cattle herds across the plateau. More and more Tibetan laborers were also participating, with men and women working hard to dig soil and carry stones. In order to enable Lhasa to better breathe in sync with the heart of the motherland—Beijing, the Tibetan people contributed their strong strength to the road construction project.

Wherever the road was built, new scenes appeared. New towns were built; new-style farms were established; hospitals were established; schools were established! Cars brought daily necessities, and veterinarians also came to the grasslands! Look! How young and strong the mother who came out of the hospital holding her newborn baby looked, and how sweetly and joyfully the children who were listening to the teacher reading books smiled. A prosperous and happy scene appeared on the desolate grassland.

At the end of the film, it shows the grand occasion of the full completion of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. Looking at the red flags flying everywhere, looking at the colorful flowers dancing everywhere; listening to the joyful laughter, listening to the happy songs, our hearts can't help but tremble with joy. Once again, with excitement, we pay tribute to the road-building heroes who have made outstanding contributions. We also sincerely thank the staff who participated in the filming of this film (this film was jointly produced by the Film Studio of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Czechoslovak Army Film Studio). In order to make this film, they traveled through mountains and rivers and traveled to many major areas of Kangzang, paying a huge amount of labor. Their careful cultivation has yielded good harvests. This film won the Reporting Documentary Award at the 9th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, precisely because it vividly and truthfully reported to people how the great "Golden Bridge" was built!

    “金桥”是怎样修成的？
    ——介绍纪录片“通向拉萨的幸福道路”
    苏方
    复盖着积雪的山峰是这样秀丽，平静的湖水是这样澄澈；无垠的田地里麦穗临风摇摆，辽阔的草原上牛群、羊群来来往往。这就是美丽、富庶的西藏。长时期来，西藏和祖国内地交通阻隔，藏族人民不能更多地得到祖国各族人民的帮助，不能更迅速地提高自己的生活。为了改变这种情况，为了更好地帮助藏族人民，在党和政府的领导下，在各族人民的共同努力下，我们修通了被藏族人民称为“金桥”的康藏、青藏两条公路，创造了亘古未有的奇迹。“通向拉萨的幸福道路”就是纪录这两条公路修筑情况的大型彩色纪录片。这部影片，以相当生动的画面，把筑路战士、工人、藏族民工们和大自然作斗争的英雄行为，特别是从1950年就参加筑路工作的中国人民解放军指战员们的“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的宏伟气概，作了真实的反映。
    西藏的高山激流曾经吓倒过许多旅行家和探险家。1930年出版的“西藏始末纪要”一书中形容西藏的交通说：“乱石纵横，人马路绝，艰险万状，不可名态”；“世上无论何人，到此未有不胆战股栗者”。但是我们的筑路英雄们却爬上了这人迹罕到的“世界屋脊”，以排山倒海的威力，跟大自然作战！从影片里面，我们看到了多少感人的事情：奔腾咆哮的怒江是难以渡过的；但是为了要在江面上驾起滑索，将粮食和人输送过去，战士李文炎、崔锡明和伙伴们驾起一只小小的橡皮船，冲过了惊涛骇浪。为了到新的工地去工作，在野羊也难插足的峭壁上，战士们却抓住绳索一步步地向上攀登……。工作艰苦，生活也同样艰苦！电影以富有风趣的艺术手法，通过一、两个场面，把这种情况突出地表现了出来：雀儿山上的战士起床了，可是床前的鞋子却冻在地上，得费多大的劲才能把鞋拔起来穿在脚上啊！而“真没有想到，在这里起床都有困难”这一句幽默的解说词。也加强了这个镜头的表现力和感染力。我们也看到战士们休息时的情况：他们正在聚精会神地看画报，正在愉快地吹着笛子，正在专心一意地下象棋。这些情景明显地告诉我们：他们有着高度的革命乐观主义精神，他们有着不可磨灭的战斗意志，他们是决不会向困难低头的！
    影片以相当大的篇幅表现了西藏地方政府和藏族人民对于筑路工程的关怀和支持。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼都曾来到工地向筑路部队和民工进行慰问，达赖喇嘛还亲赴烈士张福林墓前作了祈祷。年青的藏族姑娘曲梅巴真，为了给筑路人员运送物资，不辞劳苦，赶着牛群在高原上奔走。藏族民工也愈来愈多了，男男女女都在紧张地挖土背石。为了使拉萨能跟祖国的心脏--北京更好地呼吸相通，藏族人民在筑路工程中贡献了自己强大的力量。
    路修到哪里，哪里就出现了新气象。新的城镇建设起来了；新式农场建立了；医院建立起来了；学校建立起来了！汽车运来了生活用品，兽医也来到了草原！看啦！那抱着初生的婴儿从医院里出来的母亲显得多么年青健壮，那在听老师讲书的孩子们笑得多么甜蜜欢欣。荒漠的草原上呈现出了繁荣幸福的景象。
    影片最后，表现了康藏、青藏两条公路全线通车的盛况。看着那到处飘扬的红旗，看着那到处飞舞的彩花；听着那愉快的笑声，听着那幸福的歌声，我们的心也不禁因为喜悦而颤动起来。我们再次怀着激动的心情，向建立了卓著功勋的筑路英雄们致敬。我们也衷心地感谢参加拍摄这部影片的工作人员们（这部影片是由中国人民解放军总政治部电影制片厂和捷克斯洛伐克陆军电影制片厂联合摄制的）。为了摄制这部影片，他们曾经跋山涉水，走遍了康藏许多主要地区，付出了巨大的劳动。他们精心的耕作，获得了良好的收成。这部影片在第九届卡罗维发利国际电影节上，荣获了报道纪录片奖，这正是由于它生动而又真实地向人们报道了伟大的“金桥”是怎样修成的！
