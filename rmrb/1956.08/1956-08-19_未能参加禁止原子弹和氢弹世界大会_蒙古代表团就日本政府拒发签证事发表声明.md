Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The delegation from the Mongolian People's Republic, invited by Japanese peace activists to attend the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan, was unable to attend because the Japanese government refused to issue visas. The delegation issued a statement on the matter in Beijing on the 14th.

The statement said that the noble purpose of this conference and the Japanese people's struggle against atomic weapons have been fully understood and warmly supported by the Mongolian people. The Mongolian people are determined to join the Japanese people and the people of the world in opposing the threat of atomic war and defending peace in Asia and the world.

The statement pointed out: "The Japanese peace workers invited representatives of the Mongolian people to participate in the work of this conference, but the Japanese government, regardless of the invitation of the Japanese people, refused to issue visas to the representatives of the Mongolian people without any basis whatsoever. This stance of the Japanese ruling clique is very strange and shows no desire for peace.

"We believe that the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will make a great contribution to the struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, to strive for lasting peace, and to oppose any threat of war. We pay tribute to the conference and offer our best wishes for success to the conference."

The delegation departed from Beijing on the 14th to return to their country.

    未能参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会
    蒙古代表团就日本政府拒发签证事发表声明
    新华社17日讯　应日本和平人士邀请去日本参加第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的蒙古人民共和国代表团，因为日本政府拒绝发给签证没有能够成行。代表团十四日在北京就这件事发表了声明。
    声明说，这一次大会的崇高目的和日本人民反对原子武器的斗争，得到了蒙古人民的完全理解和热烈的支持。蒙古人民有决心和日本人民、全世界人民一道反对原子战争的威胁和保卫亚洲和世界的和平。
    声明指出：“日本的和平工作者邀请蒙古人民代表参加这次大会的工作，但是日本政府却不顾日本人民的邀请，毫无任何根据地拒绝发给蒙古人民代表团进入日本的签证。日本统治集团的这种立场是非常奇怪和毫无和平愿望的。
    “我们相信第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会将对禁止原子武器和氢武器、争取持久和平和反对战争的任何威胁的斗争带来巨大的贡献。我们向大会致敬并把最好的愿望——工作胜利献给大会。”
    代表团已经在十四日从北京动身回国。
