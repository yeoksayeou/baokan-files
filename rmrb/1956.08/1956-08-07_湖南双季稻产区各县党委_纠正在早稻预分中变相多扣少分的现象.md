Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th. The Chinese Communist Party committees in the double-cropping rice areas of Hunan Province are promptly correcting the phenomenon of disguised excessive deductions and under-distribution in the pre-distribution by some cooperatives.

This year, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have generally had bumper harvests of early rice. During pre-distribution, some cooperative cadres wanted to retain more public property and implemented a policy of covert deduction but overt non-deduction, using underestimated yields to reduce the actual portion distributed to members. According to a check of 2,444 cooperatives in Xiangtan, Wangcheng, Xiangyin, and Pingjiang counties, 449 cooperatives, in particular, reduced the actual proportion distributed to members to below 60% due to underestimated yields. The pre-distribution plan of the Xin Jian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingjiang County stipulated that 60% of the early rice would be distributed to members, but according to the actual yield of early rice in the whole cooperative, only slightly more than 50% was distributed to members. This aroused dissatisfaction among the members.

Based on the results of the investigation, the CCP committees in various counties further educated the cadres of the agricultural production cooperatives on the distribution policy of less deduction and more distribution, more work, more gain, re-examined and revised the unreasonable pre-distribution plans, distributed the excess deduction to the members according to workdays, and explained it to the members. More than 110 cooperatives in Taoyuan and Pingjiang counties, which originally implemented excessive deduction and under-distribution, have re-examined and revised their pre-distribution plans, increasing the portion distributed to members from below 60% of the total income to about 60% to 70%. The actual total yield of early rice in Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanxian County was more than 728,000 catties, but the portion originally distributed to members was only more than 250,000 catties, accounting for 34% of the total yield. Many members could not even get enough rations according to workdays, so they were unwilling to work. After the cooperative re-examined and revised the pre-distribution plan, it was decided to distribute 65% of the early rice to the members, so that more than 90% of the members increased their income compared with the same period last year. The day after the new pre-distribution plan was announced, all the labor force of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative actively invested in the rush planting of late rice.

### 湖南双季稻产区各县党委  纠正在早稻预分中变相多扣少分的现象

    湖南双季稻产区各县党委
    纠正在早稻预分中变相多扣少分的现象
    新华社长沙5日电　湖南省双季稻地区的各县中共党委，及时纠正部分社在预分中的变相多扣少分现象。
    今年各地农业生产合作社早稻普遍丰收，在预分中，部分社的干部想多留公共财产，实行了暗扣明不扣，用低估产量的办法降低了实际分配给社员的部分。据湘潭，望城、湘阴、平江四个县2，444个合作社的检查，就有449个社由于低估产量，分配给社员的实际比例都在60％以下。平江县新建农业生产合作社的预分方案规定60％的早稻分给社员，但按全社早稻实际产量计算，分配给社员的只50％多一点。这引起了社员的不满。
    各县中共党委根据检查结果，进一步向农业生产合作社干部进行了少扣多分、多劳多得的分配政策教育，对不合理的预分方案重新做了审查和修订，把多扣部分按劳动日分给社员，并向社员作了解释。桃源、平江两县原来实行了多扣少分的一百一十多个合作社，重新审查和修订的预分方案，都已把分给社员的部分由原来占总收入的60％以下提高到了60％到70％左右。南县新华农业生产合作社早稻实际总产量七十二万八千多斤，原来分给社员部分仅只二十五万多斤，占总产量的34％，许多社员按劳动日连口粮也分不足，因而不愿意出工。这个社重新修订预分方案后，决定把65％的早稻分给了社员，这样90％以上的社员比去年同期增加了收入。新的预分方案公布的第二天，新华农业社的全部劳动力都积极投入了抢插晚稻。
