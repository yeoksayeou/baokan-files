    Good Place North and South of the Tianshan Mountains
    Building Reservoirs to Utilize Snowmelt for Irrigating Farmland
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Bureau has surveyed ten small reservoir sites for agricultural cooperatives in Urumqi, Mi泉(Mi Quan), Changji, Jimusaer, Qitai and other counties on the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in the past six months. Among them, the Ta Qiaowan and Shi Er Hu reservoirs in Mi泉(Mi Quan) County have already started construction, and the Shi Ren Zi Gou and Jiu Dao Wan reservoirs in Urumqi County, as well as reservoirs in other areas, have also started design and measurement work one after another.

    Before construction and design, the Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Bureau sent water conservancy technicians to conduct detailed investigations of the terrain, soil, water sources, and the soil, crops, and farming methods in the irrigation areas around each reservoir. These small reservoir sites are all selected in places close to farmland and where the natural terrain is conducive to water storage. The projects are relatively simple, with low investment and high returns. After the completion of the Shi Ren Zi Gou Reservoir in Urumqi County, the storage capacity will be 3.2 million cubic meters, which can increase the irrigation area of nearly 10,000 mu of land. The total project cost is only more than 300,000 yuan, and the income from the reservoir in the first year can completely offset these costs.

    The vast farmland north and south of the Tianshan Mountains mainly relies on the snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains in summer for irrigation. During the summer flood season, most of the water flows into the Gobi Desert, and there is often a shortage of water in the spring when the accumulated snow has not melted. After the completion of these reservoirs, the difficulty of water shortage in the farmland of the above-mentioned areas will be gradually resolved.
    Reclaiming Saline-Alkali Land into Fertile Fields
    A land planning work team has arrived in the Korla Oasis from Urumqi and is currently working on planning Boguxi Lake, an ancient lake on the banks of the Peacock River that is heavily saline-alkali and about to dry up, into a mechanized state-owned farm.

    The planning of this farm is being carried out by the Ministry of Land Reclamation to reclaim the vast saline-alkali land in northwest China and Xinjiang into fertile fields, using this as a typical demonstration and to improve the technology of agricultural cadres in various places for developing saline-alkali land. This is also Xinjiang's first attempt to design an irrigated farm on heavily saline-alkali land. The focus of the farm planning work is on solving irrigation, drainage systems, and improving land fertility. The salt content of the soil in Boguxi Lake reaches 24% to 40%, exceeding the standard of 3% or less for general salt content. The groundwater level is only about 50 centimeters, the terrain has a large difference in elevation, soil erosion is high, and salt and alkali are easily exposed to the surface. The project of opening up a farm here is complex and requires high technology.

    The farm will be planned by the end of this year and is expected to be put into production next year. Various crops will be planted by the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps and developed into a comprehensive farm.
    Developing the Eastern Tianshan Forest Area
    The red pine and white pine produced in the eastern Tianshan Mountains are being continuously transported eastward to construction sites along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Yumen Oil Mine, and the Qaidam Basin. In the past two months alone, thousands of logs have been transported from the Hami forest area to Hongliu Garden, Hongliu River, and other places along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to build construction sheds. It is estimated that the wood supplied for railway construction this year (excluding sleepers) will be equal to the entire logging volume of the forest area last year, and a large amount of wood will also be supplied to the Yumen Oil Mine and the Qaidam Basin for construction. This year, the planned logging volume of this forest area has increased by two times compared to last year.

    A forest management survey team with hundreds of staff is conducting a comprehensive survey in the forests stretching hundreds of miles in the eastern section of the Tianshan Mountains. The forest area in Hami County and Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County alone is more than 70,000 hectares, and the main tree species is high-quality red pine. In order to meet the needs of various places, the Hami forest area has newly opened a logging area in August.
    Building a Highway Over the Tianshan Mountains
    The highway from Hami to Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County on the northern side of the Tianshan Mountains is under construction. After the completion of this highway, the timber from the Tianshan forest area, and the grain, livestock products, and coking coal from Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County can be transported to Hami in large quantities by trucks to meet the needs of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway during construction and after it opens to traffic. It will also play a major role in the economic and cultural development of Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County.

    This highway is being rebuilt using an existing cart road. It is about 130 kilometers long, passing through the Tianshan forest area and crossing the Tianshan Temple at an altitude of 1,700 meters above sea level. The project is relatively arduous. It is expected to be completed and open to traffic within this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 天山南北好地方

    天山南北好地方
    兴建水库利用雪水灌溉农田
    新疆维吾尔自治区水利局，半年多以来在天山南北麓乌鲁木齐、米泉、昌吉、吉木萨尔、奇台等县，为各农业社勘察了十处小型水库库址。其中米泉县塔桥湾和十二户两个水库已经施工，乌鲁木齐县石人字沟和九道湾以及其他各地的水库也陆续开始设计和测量。
    在施工和设计以前，自治区水利局派了水利技术干部对各水库周围的地形、土质、水源和水库灌溉区的土壤、作物、耕作方法等作了详查。这些小型水库库址都选在靠近农田、自然地势利于蓄水的地方，工程比较简单，投资少而收效大。乌鲁木齐县石人字沟水库建成以后，蓄水量为三百二十万公方，可增加近万亩土地的灌溉面积，全部工程费用只用三十多万元，水库的第一年收益就可以完全抵清这些费用。
    天山南北广大农田主要靠夏季消融的天山雪水灌溉。夏季洪水期大部分的水泄入戈壁滩，春季积雪未化时又往往缺水。这些水库建成之后，上述各地农田的缺水困难将逐步得到解决。
    把盐碱地开垦为良田
    一个土地规划工作队由乌鲁木齐到达了库尔勒绿州，正在进行把孔雀河畔一个盐碱很重快要干涸的古代湖泊——博古西湖规划为一个机械化的国营农场的工作。
    规划这座农场是农垦部为了把我国西北和新疆广阔的含有盐碱的土地开垦为良田，以这里作为典型示范，并借此提高各地农业干部开发盐碱土地的技术。这也是新疆第一次尝试在盐碱较重的土地上设计一个灌溉农场。这座农场规划工作的重点在于解决灌溉、排水系统及提高土地肥力问题。博古西湖土地的含盐量达24％到40％，超过一般含盐量应在3％以下的标准；地下水位只有五十公分左右，地形高低差很大，水土流失多，盐碱易于晒出地面。在这里开辟农场的工程是复杂的，需要较高的技术。
    农场在今年底将规划完毕，预计明年可以投入生产，由新疆军区农业生产建设部队种植各种作物，辟为综合性的农场。
    开发天山东部林区
    天山东部出产的红松、白松正源源东运到兰新铁路沿线工地、玉门油矿和柴达木盆地。仅最近两月，从哈密林区运往兰新铁路沿线红柳园、红柳河等地修筑工棚的木料就有几千根。预计今年内供给修筑铁路的木料（不包括枕木），就将等于这个林区去年全年的采伐量，供给玉门油矿和柴达木盆地进行建设的木料也很多。今年，这个林区的计划伐木量比去年增加了两倍。
    一个拥有几百名工作人员的森林经理调查大队，正在天山东段绵延几百里的森林中进行全面调查。仅哈密县和巴里坤哈萨克族自治县的森林面积就有七万多公顷，主要树种是优质木材的红松。为了满足各地的需要，哈密林区在八月份又新开辟了一处采伐区。修筑翻越天山的公路
    从哈密通向天山北面巴里坤哈萨克族自治县的公路正在修建。这条公路建成以后，天山林区的木材，巴里坤哈萨克族自治县的粮食、畜产品和焦煤，就可以由汽车大量运到哈密，以供应兰新铁路修筑时和通车后的需要，并且对发展巴里坤哈萨克族自治县的经济和文化事业将起很大作用。
    这条公路是利用原有的一条大车路改建的，全长约一百三十公里，中间经过天山林区，还要跨过天山山脉海拔一千七百公尺的天山庙，工程比较艰巨。预计今年内可完工通车。（据新华社讯）
