Romania's Achievements

    Heavy Industry Accounts for Over 60%
    Romania's total industrial output has more than tripled since liberation. Metallurgy, petroleum, coal mining, machinery, and chemical industries have developed particularly rapidly. In 1955, Romania produced 575,000 tons of pig iron, 765,000 tons of steel, 6.2 million tons of coal, and 4.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Heavy industry now accounts for over 60% of the entire industry. Petroleum is Romania's most important industrial product. Before the war, the annual output was only more than 6.5 million tons, but now it has exceeded 10 million tons, ranking second in Europe (next only to the Soviet Union). Romania's machinery industry has developed even more rapidly. Before the war, less than 1% of the machinery in the country's factories was produced domestically. Now, Romanian-produced machinery and equipment can meet more than 60% of the country's needs.
    During the second Five-Year Plan, which began this year, Romania's total industrial output will increase by another 60% to 65%, which is equivalent to 4.6 to 4.8 times the pre-war level of 1938.
      Annual Grain Production Exceeds 10 Million Tons
    The rapid increase in grain production is Romania's greatest achievement in agriculture in recent years. In 1955, its grain output reached 10,834,000 tons, an increase of more than 4 million tons compared to 1951. Calculated per capita, Romania can now distribute approximately 620 kilograms of grain per person per year. By 1960, Romania's grain output will increase to 15 million tons.
    Romania's agricultural collectivization has also made progress, especially rapidly in the first half of this year. The number of collective farms and cooperative farming societies increased from more than 6,300 at the end of last year to more than 9,400 in June of this year. During this period, a total of more than 195,000 peasant households joined cooperatives. Now, the socialist sector in Romania's agriculture accounts for 29.3% of all arable land and 37.1% of the total sown area.
    The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party recently passed a resolution on the socialist transformation of agriculture. It was decided to vigorously develop agricultural collectivization during the second Five-Year Plan, so that by 1960, the socialist sector will supply 60% to 70% of the commodity agricultural products.
      National Income More Than Double Pre-War Levels
    Romania's economic achievements can be reflected in the increase in its national income. In 1955, Romania's national income was two and a half times that of 1948, and nearly double that of the pre-war period. Now, 71% of the total national income comes from socialist economic components.
    In 1938, agriculture accounted for a much larger proportion of the national income than industry. Due to the rapid development of industry after liberation, industry now accounts for nearly half of the national income.
          Income and Consumption
    The actual income of the working people increased by 28% during the first Five-Year Plan. At the same time, expenditures decreased. Before the war, rent and various public utilities expenses accounted for nearly half of a worker's or employee's monthly income, while in 1955, they only accounted for one-eighth or one-ninth.
    In terms of consumer goods, the consumption of main foods by working-class families in 1955 increased compared to 1948 as follows: bread by more than half, oils and fats by two times, meat by 85%, sugar by 138%, and milk by 25%. In the past five years, Romania's commodity circulation has doubled.

    罗马尼亚的成就
    重工业比重占60％以上
    罗马尼亚的工业总产量在解放以后增加了二倍多。冶金、石油、采煤、机械、化学等重工业部门发展得特别迅速。罗马尼亚在1955年出产了生铁五十七万五千吨，钢七十六万五千吨，煤六百二十万吨，发电量四十三亿瓩时。重工业在整个工业中的比重已占60％以上。石油是罗马尼亚最重要的工业产品。战前全年产量只六百五十多万吨，现在已超过一千万吨，占欧洲的第二位（仅次于苏联）。罗马尼亚的机械工业发展更是迅速，战前全国工厂内不到百分之一的机械是本国出产的。现在罗马尼亚出产的机器设备已能满足全国60％以上的需要了。
    在从今年开始的第二个五年计划期间，罗马尼亚的工业总产量将再增加60％到65％，也就是说，将等于战前1938年的四点六到四点八倍。
      谷物年产一千多万吨
    谷物生产的迅速增加是罗马尼亚农业近年来的最大成就。1955年它的谷物产量已达到一千零八十三万四千吨，比1951年增加了四百多万吨。按人口平均计算，现在罗马尼亚全国每人每年可以分得约六百二十公斤谷物。到1960年时，罗马尼亚的谷物产量将增加到一千五百万吨。
    罗马尼亚的农业合作化也有了进展。特别在今年上半年，发展得更是迅速。集体农庄和联合耕种社的数目从去年年底的六千三百多个增加到今年六月份的九千四百多个。在这段时间内参加合作社的农民共有十九万五千多户。现在罗马尼亚农业中的社会主义部分占全部可耕地的29.3％，占全部播种面积的37.1％。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会在最近通过了一个关于农业社会主义改造问题的决议。决定要在第二个五年计划期间大力发展农业合作化，以便到1960年的时候使社会主义部分所供应的商品农产品达到60％到70％。
      国民收入比战前多两倍
    罗马尼亚的经济成就可以从它的国民收入的增加反映出来。1955年，罗马尼亚的国民收入等于1948年的二倍半，而比战前增加了近两倍。现在全部国民收入的71％是来自社会主义经济成分的。
    1938年，农业在国民收入中所占的比重大大地超过工业，由于解放后工业的迅速发展，现在工业在国民收入中所占的比重已近一半。
          收入和消费
    劳动人民的实际收入在第一个五年计划期间增加了28％。而同时，支出却减少了。在战前，房租和各种公用事业的支出要占一个工人或职员每月收入的近一半，而在1955年只占到八、九分之一。
    在消费品方面，工人家庭主要食品的消费量1955年比1948年增加如下：面包一半多，油脂两倍，肉类85％，食糖138％，牛奶25％。在过去的五年内，罗马尼亚的商品流通量增加了一倍。
