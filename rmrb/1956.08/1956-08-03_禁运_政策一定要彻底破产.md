The United States' policy of forcing countries accepting "U.S. Aid" to implement "embargoes" is part of its overall plan to disrupt normal international relations, poison the international atmosphere, and create global tensions.

It attempts to hinder the economic development of socialist countries by severing their economic ties with other nations. Simultaneously, it undermines the normal economic relations between countries adhering to the "embargo" policy and the socialist camp, forcing these countries into one-sided economic dependence on the United States. This allows the U.S. to monopolize markets, and through plunder and deterioration of these countries' economies, makes them more economically reliant on the U.S., thereby compelling them to follow the U.S. politically.

Facts have proven that the "embargo" has not hindered the economic development of socialist countries, but has caused serious losses to the countries that follow this policy.

The "embargo" has had particularly severe consequences for Southeast Asian countries, which have always relied on the production and export of raw materials and food. As we know, Malaysia and Indonesia account for about half of the world's tin production, and natural rubber accounts for 70% of the world's total. In addition, Thailand, Burma, and other countries in the region also have abundant reserves of valuable raw materials. However, the "embargo" prevents Southeast Asian countries from conducting normal trade with China, the Soviet Union, and other People's Democratic countries. Through the "embargo" policy, U.S. monopoly capital controls the rich raw material sources of Southeast Asian countries, relying on its monopoly position as the largest buyer to arbitrarily lower prices through measures such as reducing purchases, refusing to purchase, and increasing the production of substitutes. This makes it difficult for Southeast Asian countries to sell their products, resulting in a sharp drop in prices, a sharp decline in exports, and an increase in import surpluses. According to a report by the British "Rubber Research Board," Southeast Asian rubber producers' income decreased by $575 million in 1953 alone due to the decline in rubber prices. Due to the decline in rubber prices, Indonesia's rubber exports decreased by $1 billion from 1951 to 1953.

Under the dual blows of the U.S. "embargo" and price suppression, these countries not only face extreme difficulties in foreign trade, but their raw material production is also increasingly shrinking, especially the small-scale agricultural production that occupies an important position. For example, small-scale rubber production in Malaysia accounts for more than two-fifths of the country's total rubber production, and its output decreased from 270,000 tons in 1951 to 240,000 tons in 1952. During the same period, Indonesia's small-scale rubber production, calculated by export volume, also decreased from more than 590,000 tons to more than 440,000 tons. Although production is shrinking day by day, there is still an artificial surplus. According to statistics, the surplus of natural rubber in 1952 reached as high as 315,000 tons.

The impact of the "embargo" on Japan's national economy is particularly serious. It has greatly reduced Japan's trade with China. According to statistics from the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, before the Second World War, Japan's annual exports to China accounted for 34.1% of Japan's total exports, and imports from China accounted for 16.6% of Japan's total imports. However, by 1955, the proportions had fallen to 1.45% and 3.69% respectively.

The U.S. uses the "embargo" to prevent Japan from obtaining cheap coal, salt, and iron ore from China, forcing Japan to import these materials from the U.S. and other countries at high prices and excessive freight costs.

The "embargo" has also caused serious losses to Britain. Britain has always dominated the raw material markets of countries such as Malaysia, thereby obtaining huge dollar revenues. In the past, Indonesia's and Thailand's exports were also transshipped through Singapore. From the second half of 1951 to the first half of 1952, Britain's dollar income from the sale of rubber in Malaysia alone was almost equal to the total dollar income of the British mainland's exports to the United States. However, due to the rubber price decline and sluggish sales caused by the "embargo" policy, Britain lost $200 million in revenue in Malaysia in 1953.

China and Britain have had trade relations for more than 270 years. In the years with the highest trade volume between the two countries in the past, the total import and export volume reached $200 million. The "embargo" has caused the trade volume between the two countries to drop sharply.

The U.S. "embargo" policy has also damaged the export trade of other Western capitalist countries. At the same time, it has made the problem of commodity markets, which are already fiercely competitive in the capitalist world market, particularly acute.

Therefore, the U.S.'s "embargo" policy, which is imposed on various countries, has naturally met with increasingly strong opposition from various countries. The calls for lifting the "embargo," especially for lifting restrictions on trade with China, are rising and gradually turning into action. In June of this year, the British government announced that it would use the "exception procedure" to expand trade with China. At the same time, Britain authorized all its colonial governments to relax the "embargo" on China. On June 4, the governments of Singapore and Malaysia officially announced the lifting of the ban on exporting rubber to China.

These measures have caused a great reaction in all aspects. The Indonesian government expressed its welcome to this and announced that Indonesia is no longer bound by the rubber embargo. Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and some Western European countries have also expressed dissatisfaction with the "embargo" policy, advocating expanding trade between East and West, especially demanding expanding trade with China. Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi said: Like Britain, Japan must make greater efforts to increase trade with China. On the West German side, they are also "particularly interested" in the news of Britain's relaxation of exports to China, and Ruhr industrialists have even launched a campaign, resolutely demanding that the West German government lift all restrictions on trade with the East as soon as possible. The Philippine Senate Majority Leader Primicias made a statement, agreeing to trade with the People's Republic of China, and called on Philippine entrepreneurs not to over-rely on the United States.

Currently, the voices of opposition to the "embargo" from all over the world can be heard everywhere. Agence France-Presse reporter Bellamy reported that world public opinion seems to be convinced that "trade bans have become an error of the times today."

The United States continues to exert diplomatic pressure on countries that demand the relaxation of the "embargo," but has not achieved the results it expected. Eisenhower and Eden said in a statement after their meeting in Washington earlier this year: "The scope of trade controls should be reviewed now and periodically in accordance with the constantly changing situation." As we all know, the United States has delayed this review, and Britain could not wait and took unilateral action to relax the embargo by using the "exception procedure." United Press reporters said uneasily when reporting on Britain's actions: "From the government's point of view, the trap is here: Since Britain has taken the lead in expanding trade with Communist China, other countries will be encouraged to take the same action. If too many exceptions are tolerated in the embargo list, then these exceptions will no longer be exceptions, and this control—referring to the trade 'embargo'—will soon be dead in name only."

Lifting the "embargo" and trade restrictions, restoring and developing normal trade between countries not only has significant economic implications, but also clears the way for establishing trust between countries, bringing them closer together, establishing broad connections between people of all countries, and promoting the resolution of international political issues. This is in line with the vital interests of all countries and peoples. It is precisely because of this that it has become a universal demand of public opinion in various countries.

The Chinese government and people have always advocated developing international trade on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchanging what one has for what one needs. Due to the joint efforts of the Chinese government and various circles in other countries, the number of countries and regions trading with China has increased from 47 in 1954 to 62 in 1955. In terms of the trade volume between China and Asian, African, and Western countries, it increased by 28.2% in 1955 compared to 1954. In the future, with China's economic development and the achievements of various countries in further eliminating trade barriers, trade relations between China and other countries will develop on a larger scale. The notorious "embargo" policy is bound to be thoroughly bankrupted.

    “禁运”政策一定要彻底破产
    林沧海
    美国强迫接受“美援”的国家实行“禁运”政策，是它破坏国际正常关系、毒化国际气氛、制造世界紧张局势的总计划的一部分。
    它企图用割断社会主义国家和其他国家经济联系的办法来阻挠它们经济的发展，同时破坏奉行“禁运”政策的国家同社会主义阵营各国间的正常经济关系，迫使这些国家同美国建立片面的经济关系，使美国得以垄断市场，并且用掠夺和恶化这些国家的经济的方法，使它们在经济上更加依靠美国，从而在政治上也不得不追随美国。
    事实已经证明，“禁运”并未能阻碍社会主义国家的经济发展，但对于奉行这个政策的国家则造成了严重的损失。
    “禁运”给一向依靠生产和输出原料和粮食的东南亚国家带来特别深重的恶果。大家知道，马来亚和印度尼西亚的锡产量约占全世界总产量的一半，而天然橡胶产量更占全世界总产量的70％。此外、泰国、缅甸和这个区域的其他国家，有价值原料的蕴藏也是很多的。可是“禁运”使东南亚国家不能对中国、苏联及其他人民民主国家进行正常的贸易。美国垄断资本通过“禁运”政策控制东南亚国家丰富的原料来源，仗着最大买主的垄断地位，以减购、拒购和增产代用品为手段，任意压低价格，使得东南亚国家的产品销售困难，价格猛跌，出口激减，入超增加。据英国“天然橡胶局”报告书说，由于橡胶跌价，仅在1953年内，东南亚橡胶生产者的收入就减少了五亿七千五百万美元。印度尼西亚由于橡胶价格的下降，从1951年到1953年就减少了十亿美元的橡胶出口。
    在美国“禁运”和压价的双重打击下，这些国家不仅对外贸易处于极端困难的境地，而且原料生产日益萎缩下来，特别是占有重要地位的小农生产剧烈减少。如马来亚小农橡胶产量占全国橡胶产量五分之二以上，其产量就从1951年的27万吨，减少到1952年的24万吨；同期印度尼西亚小农橡胶产量以输出数量计算，也由59万余吨减为44万余吨。生产虽然日益萎缩，还发生了人为的过剩现象。据统计，1952年天然橡胶的剩余数达三十一万五千吨之多。
    “禁运”对于日本国民经济的影响是特别严重的。它使日本对中国贸易大大地削减了。据日本国际贸易促进协会的统计，第二次大战前日本每年对中国的输出占日本全部输出的34.1％，从中国的输入占日本全部输入的16.6％，可是到了1955年，比重分别下降到1.45％和3.69％。
    美国利用“禁运”不让日本从中国得到廉价的煤、盐和铁矿砂等，而迫使日本不得不用高价和过高的运费从美国及其他国家输入这些物资。
    “禁运”对英国也造成了严重的损失。英国一向支配着马来亚等国的原料市场，从而获得巨大的美元收入。过去，印度尼西亚和泰国的输出品也经由新加坡转口。1951年下半年至1952年上半年，英国仅从马来亚出售橡胶所得美元，就几乎等于英国本部对美输出的全部美元收入。但由于“禁运”政策造成橡胶跌价和滞销，1953年英国在马来亚就损失了两亿美元的收入。
    中英两国贸易关系已有二百七十多年的历史，在过去两国输出入额最高年份曾达到两亿美元。“禁运”使两国贸易额急剧下降了。
    美国的“禁运”政策，也使得西方其他资本主义国家的出口贸易受到损害，同时，使得本来就在资本主义世界市场上剧烈竞争着的商品市场问题特别尖锐起来。
    因此，美国这种强加于各国身上的“禁运”政策，自然地遭到了各国越来越强烈的反对。要求解除“禁运”特别是取消对中国贸易的限制的呼声日益高涨，而且逐步变成为行动了。今年六月，英国政府宣布运用“例外程序”扩大对中国的贸易。同时，英国授权给它所有的殖民地政府，对中国实行放宽“禁运”。六月四日，新加坡和马来亚政府正式宣布取消了向中国输出橡胶的禁令。
    这些措施在各方面引起了很大的反应。印度尼西亚政府对此表示欢迎，并宣布印度尼西亚也不再受橡胶禁运的约束。日本、泰国、菲律宾和西欧的一些国家，也纷纷表示不满“禁运”政策，主张扩大东西方的贸易，特别是要求扩大对中国的贸易。日本的通商产业相石桥湛山说：像英国一样，日本必须作出更大的努力来增加同中国的贸易。在西德方面，对英国放宽对中国出口的消息，也“特别感到兴趣”，而鲁尔区工业家们甚至发动了运动，坚决要求西德政府尽快的取消同东方进行贸易的一切限制。菲律宾参议院多数派领袖普里米西亚斯发表谈话，赞成和中华人民共和国的贸易，并且号召菲律宾的企业家不要过分信赖美国。
    目前世界各国反对“禁运”的呼声，到处可闻。法新社记者贝拉密报道说：世界舆论似乎已经确信“贸易的禁令今天已成为时代的错误”。
    美国对要求放宽“禁运”的国家不断施加外交压力，但未能得到它所期望的结果。艾森豪威尔和艾登今年初在华盛顿会谈后曾在声明中说：“应该在现在和定期地按照不断变化的局势就贸易管制范围加以审查。”大家知道，美国拖延了这种审查，英国迫不及待，就采取了运用“例外程序”放宽禁运的单独行动。合众社的记者在报道英国的这种行动时不安地说：“从政府的观点来看，陷阱就在这里：既然英国已经领头扩大对中国共产党的贸易，其他国家就会得到鼓励而采取同样行动。如果容忍禁运货单有太多的例外，那末，这些例外就会不再是例外，而这种管制——指贸易‘禁运’——也就会很快地名存实亡。”
    取消“禁运”和贸易限制，恢复和发展国与国间的正常贸易，不仅具有经济方面的重大意义，而且还可以为国与国之间建立信任扫清道路，使它们互相接近，建立各国人民之间的广泛联系，促进国际政治问题的解决。这是符合所有国家和人民的切身利益的。也正是因为如此，这成了各国舆论的普遍的要求。
    中国政府和人民一贯主张在平等互利和互通有无的原则上发展国际贸易。由于中国和其他国家的政府或各界人士的共同努力，同中国进行贸易的国家和地区已从1954年的四十七个增加到1955年的六十二个。以中国同亚非国家和西方国家的贸易额来说，1955年比1954年增加了28.2％。今后，随着中国经济的发展，和各国进一步消除贸易障碍的成就，中国同其他国家之间的贸易关系将会更大规模地发展起来。臭名远扬的“禁运”政策是一定要彻底破产的。
