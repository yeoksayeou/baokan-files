Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 12th: The first group of over 120 surveyors participating in the preliminary survey of the southern section of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway have departed from Chengdu and along the Neijiang-Kunming Railway in the past few days. The second group of over 150 people will also head to the construction site in late August.

Most of these surveyors have participated in the survey work for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Lizhan Railway, the Yingxia Railway, and the Neijiang-Kunming Railway. Before their departure this time, they fully studied the Chengdu-Kunming Railway route and learned various advanced survey experiences.

The Chengdu-Kunming Railway is divided into the northern section (Chengdu to Emei, approximately 150 kilometers), the central section (Emei to Xichang, approximately 400 kilometers), and the southern section (Xichang to Kunming, approximately 540 kilometers). The preliminary survey of the northern section began in early June and has now completed more than 70 kilometers. Aerial surveys of the central section will be conducted before the end of the year.

    新华社成都12日电　参加初测成（都）昆（明）铁路南段的第一批一百二十多名勘测人员，已经在这几天分别从成都和内昆铁路沿线出发；第二批一百五十多人，也将在本月下旬前往工地。
    这些勘测人员大都参加过宝成铁路、黎湛铁路、鹰厦铁路和内昆铁路的勘测工作。这次出发前，他们充分研究了成昆铁路线路和学习了各种先进勘测经验。
    成昆铁路分成北段（成都到峨眉约一百五十公里）、中段（峨眉到西昌约四百公里）和南段（西昌到昆明约五百四十公里）。北段在六月初就开始了初测，现在已经完成了七十多公里。中段将在年底前进行航测。
