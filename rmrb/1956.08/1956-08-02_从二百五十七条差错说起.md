Starting from Two Hundred and Fifty-Seven Errors
Xi Ren

The state-owned commerce of Xi'an is currently inspecting property management. The problems uncovered at the East Main Street Wholesale Department of the Xi'an Department Store reveal how serious the discrepancies between accounts and physical goods, and losses and waste are in state-owned commercial departments!

This wholesale department was established in April of last year. In just the eight months from April to December of last year, there were two hundred and fifty-seven error incidents involving sums of five yuan or more. This included 5,933 yuan in overages and 4,915 yuan in shortages, not even including the 457 yuan already compensated by employees. In addition, there were damaged goods valued at 4,066 yuan, calculated at the original price.

What are the reasons for these errors and accidents?

Let's see how this wholesale department manages its goods: there are often goods in the warehouse without records, and records without goods, and the warehouse keepers have no idea of the amounts. In July of last year, the keeper's ledger showed twenty plain-faced basins, but they could not be found in the warehouse, so they reported a "shortage" and considered it canceled. However, these twenty basins were later found in a pile of goods. For a long time, there were four dozen more wool sweaters and trousers in the warehouse than were recorded in the accounts. This kind of reporting shortages when there were none, and overages when there were none, happened dozens of times last year.

In the store, samples in the counters were not placed in designated locations according to their numbers, but were placed randomly. Furthermore, the goods were not neatly arranged and classified, and the inspection and acceptance process was not thorough, leading to particularly serious instances of incorrect receiving and payment. These types of errors accounted for one hundred and sixty-five of the two hundred and fifty-seven errors. On one occasion, a customer came to buy 263 dozens of Jia-brand Camel brand plates, but the salesperson mistakenly paid out Zheng-brand plates, resulting in a loss of more than 48 yuan.

From the director to the salespeople, some in this wholesale department hold some erroneous ideas. They believe that "overages don't count as accidents, only shortages count as errors," and that "mistakes and confusion don't matter, because it all stays within the state." The main wholesale customers of this department are within the city, and they say: it's easy to recover or return goods because the distance is short and the people are familiar; and even if errors occur with wholesale goods from outside the city, there are various ways to recover them. It is precisely because of these erroneous ideas that they reduce their sense of responsibility at work.

Is it really that easy to recover wrongly paid goods and money? Once, a salesperson mistakenly wrote the "8" in the retail price of Lanji razor blades, 4 jiao 8 fen, as a "3", and sold 5,580 blades at 87% of the retail price, resulting in a loss of more than 242 yuan. In order to recover the loss, the salesperson tried every possible means to recover the money. As a result, although 162 yuan was recovered from forty customers, there was still a loss of 80 yuan, and it took a full fifteen working days.

Judging from the property management of the East Main Street Wholesale Department of the Xi'an Department Store, the property management of state-owned commerce is chaotic. During the in-depth development of this inspection work, some commercial workers emphasized how busy they were, couldn't spare the time, and were unwilling to conduct a good inspection. This is wrong. Now is the time to eliminate this chaotic situation. State-owned commercial departments must, under the principle of "no mistakes, no confusion, no loss," mobilize the broad masses of employees to achieve consistency between accounts and accounts, and between accounts and goods within a certain period, eliminate errors and accidents, and manage the property of the state and the people well.

    从二百五十七条差错说起
    西人
    目前西安市国营商业正在检查财产管理。从西安市百货公司东大街批发部检查出来的问题来看，国营商业部门账账不符、账货不符、损失浪费等现象是多么严重！
    这个批发部是去年四月成立的。仅仅在去年四月到十二月的八个月里，五元以上的差错事故，就有二百五十七条。其中长款五千九百三十三元，短款四千九百一十五元，这还不包括职工已经赔偿的四百五十七元在内。另外，还有按原价计算的价值四千零六十六元的残损商品。
    发生这些差错事故的原因是什么呢？
    且看这个批发部是怎样保管商品的：仓库里常常有货没账，有账没货，保管人员心中无数。去年七月间，保管员的账簿上有二十个素花脸盆，而库房里却找不见，于是报了个“短”字，就算勾销了。可是后来在货堆里又找到了这二十个脸盆。很久以来，仓库里就多了四打绒衣绒裤，而账上却没有。这种本来不短报短，本来不长报长的账，去年曾发生过几十次。
    商场里，柜台内的样品，不是按号放到一定的地方，而是随便乱放。加上商品本来就摆布划分不严，验收不细，这样互相倒错，错收错付的现象，特别严重。这类差错在二百五十七条差错中，就占一百六十五条。有一次，顾客来买甲字骆驼牌菜盘二百六十三打，营业员错付成正字菜盘，损失四十八元多。
    这个批发部从主任到营业员都有一些错误的想法。他们认为“长款不算事故，短款才算差错”，“错了、乱了、反正肉烂在锅里”。这个批发部的主要批发对象都在市内，他们说：路近人熟，追补退货很容易，就是外来批发货物，发生了错货现象，也有各种办法追回。正因为有这样一些错误的想法，在营业的时候，便减低了工作责任心。
    追回错付货款，是不是那样容易呢？有一次营业员把兰吉刀片零售价四角八分的“八”字错写成“三”字，这样按零售价打八七折批发出去五千五百八十片，损失了二百四十二元多。营业员为了挽回损失，就想尽办法去追。结果，虽然在四十家顾客那里，追回了一百六十二元，还是损失了八十元，而且耽搁了整整十五个工作日。
    从西安市百货公司东大街批发部的财产管理来看，国营商业的财产管理是混乱的。在这次检查工作深入开展的时候，有些商业工作人员强调工作忙，挤不出时间，不愿意好好检查。这是错误的。现在应该是消除这种混乱现象的时候了，国营商业部门必需在“不错、不乱、不损”的方针下，动员广大职工，在一定时间内做到账账相符，账货相符，消灭差错事故，把国家和人民的财产管好。
