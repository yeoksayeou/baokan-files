Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 30th. The symposium on pond and dam management and rice irrigation, convened by the Ministry of Water Conservancy in Liling County, Hunan Province, a well-known double-cropping rice high-yield area, concluded on the 28th after twelve days. Two hundred and thirteen people, including water conservancy workers, water conservancy models, and agricultural cooperative directors from seventeen provinces and cities, participated in the symposium.

Ponds and dams account for a large proportion of water conservancy facilities in the country. After the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization in various regions, one of the important tasks in water conservancy irrigation management is to further improve pond and dam management, so as to give full play to its benefits and promote agricultural production increase. Therefore, participants in the symposium spent a lot of time on on-site visits and carefully studied the irrigation management of the Sihe Reservoir irrigation area in Liling County, the adjustment of the pond and dam network canal system of the Hejialong and Chenjialong agricultural cooperatives, and the rice irrigation of the Hequan agricultural cooperative. The Sihe Reservoir irrigation area, among others, fully utilized the benefits of ponds and dams to solve the water irrigation problems for expanding double-cropping rice on the basis of not very superior existing water conservancy facilities. The Sihe Reservoir and its group of small ponds have a total storage capacity of 1.9 million cubic meters. Before 1953, the average drought resistance capacity was only 20 days, and the yield of rice per mu was less than 400 jin. After the establishment of a management organization, rational adjustment of the canal system, and unified allocation of water, the average drought resistance capacity was increased to more than 50 days. In this year of drought, with more than two months of no rain, the rice fields are still irrigated with more than an inch of water. The early rice yield averaged 436 jin per mu, and the late rice is growing well, with an estimated harvest of more than 500 jin per mu. After the Hejialong and Chenjialong agricultural cooperatives adjusted the pond and dam network canal system and divided irrigation areas, the drought resistance capacity of rice fields increased by one and a half times compared to the past. After the Hequan agricultural cooperative implemented irrigation methods for rice according to seedling condition, season, cultivation, and soil quality, the average yield of early rice reached 528 jin per mu this year, and the estimated yield of late rice is 550 jin per mu.

At the symposium, water conservancy workers from various provinces fully exchanged experiences in pond and dam management and rice irrigation. Nineteen representatives from thirteen provinces successively made typical speeches at the meeting and exchanged more than fifty kinds of experience materials. For example, Shaanxi Province introduced that the Lian River system irrigation area adopted seasonal irrigation of farmland with different water conservancy facilities, so that the rice field irrigation area this year expanded to 157,400 mu, an increase of 1.4 times compared with the pre-liberation period. This experience has attracted the attention of water conservancy workers in the southern provinces. Li Chenggui, a famous agricultural labor model, also made a report on high-yield rice at the symposium.

In order to systematically master pond and dam management methods and rice irrigation techniques, water conservancy workers from various provinces selected representatives to form four thematic groups to study issues such as organization and management, irrigation techniques, adjustment of irrigation canal systems, and engineering management and maintenance.

    发挥塘坝灌溉效益促进农业增产
    十七个省市的水利工作者等进行实地参观和交流经验
    新华社长沙30日电　水利部在著名的双季稻高产区湖南省醴陵县召集的塘坝管理和水稻灌溉座谈会，开了十二天，已经在28日闭幕。有十七个省、市的水利工作者、水利模范和农业社主任共二百一十三人，参加了这个座谈会。
    塘坝在全国水利设施中占着很大的比重。在各地基本实现农业合作化后，水利灌溉管理工作中的重要任务之一就是进一步搞好塘坝管理，使之充分发挥效益，促进农业增产。因此，参加座谈会的人用很多时间作了实地参观，并且认真研究了醴陵县四和水库灌溉区的灌溉管理、何家垅和陈家垅农业社的塘坝网渠系调整、河泉农业社的水稻灌溉等经验。四和水库灌溉区等都是在现有水利设施不太优越的基础上，充分发挥塘坝效益，解决了扩种双季稻的水利灌溉问题。四和水库和它的一群小塘坝蓄水量共达一百九十万公方，1953年以前平均抗旱能力只有二十天，每亩稻田产量不到四百斤。以后这里建立管理组织，合理调整渠系，统一调剂用水，平均抗旱能力就提高到五十天以上。像今年这样两个多月没下雨的干旱年成，稻田里仍灌有一寸多深的水，早稻产量平均每亩就有四百三十六斤，目前晚稻生长很好，估计每亩可以收获五百多斤。何家垅和陈家垅农业社把塘坝网渠系加以调整和划分灌溉区后，稻田抗旱能力比过去提高一倍半。河泉农业社对水稻实行看禾苗、分季节、按耕作、按土质的灌溉方法后，今年早稻每亩平均产量达到五百二十八斤，估计晚稻每亩能收五百五十斤。
    在座谈会上，各省水利工作者充分地交流了塘坝管理和水稻灌溉的经验。先后有十三个省的十九个代表在会上作了典型发言，并且交换了五十多种经验资料。如陕西省介绍濂水河系灌溉区采取按季节按不同水利设施引水灌溉农田，使今年的稻田灌溉面积扩大到十五万七千四百亩，比解放前增加一点四倍。这个经验引起了南方各省水利工作者的重视。著名的农业劳动模范李呈桂还在座谈会上作了关于水稻丰产的报告。
    为了系统地掌握塘坝管理方法和水稻灌溉技术，各省水利工作者在会议期间选派代表混合组成四个专题小组，对组织管理、灌溉技术、灌溉渠系调整、工程管理养护等问题作了研究。
