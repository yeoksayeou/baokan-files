Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 11th: Pakistani Prime Minister Ali said at the opening of the Karachi Agricultural Conference on August 10th that Pakistan must become self-sufficient in grain and have large reserves to prevent famine crises.

He said, "We cannot and should not rely on foreign aid for a long time. We must produce enough food to meet our needs, and we must be self-reliant."

He specifically mentioned the importance of land reform and said that the important issue of enabling farmers to obtain a real share of the land remained to be resolved. Only those who cultivate the land can supply the food we need, but they do not receive fair economic and social treatment. He also spoke of the need to change the tax system, which does not sufficiently encourage farmers to produce.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi: Pakistan and the United States signed an agreement on August 7th regarding the import of grain from the United States. According to this agreement, Pakistan will import grain and other commodities from the United States with a total value of more than 46 million US dollars. The United States will use 80% of the funds paid by Pakistan for this purpose to carry out a "defense support" program for Pakistan.

Pakistani newspapers have expressed deep dissatisfaction with this agreement. On August 10th, the Urdu newspaper "Landlord" published an editorial saying that Pakistanis do not like American wheat, milk, cheese, and other such things. "In the past, such things have been imported from the United States, and have caused various diseases and stomach upsets."

The editorial said that the government's import of these items is a waste of 220 million rupees. "If this money were allocated as loans to farmers, they could produce twice as much milk, cheese, and tobacco in one year as is imported from the United States."

The Urdu newspaper "Battle" published a cartoon on August 11th criticizing the agreement. The cartoon depicts two doctors shaking hands and happily saying, "American wheat is here again."

    巴基斯坦舆论不满政府进口美国谷物
    巴总理说不能长期依赖外国供应粮食
    据新华社喀喇蚩11日电　巴基斯坦总理阿里八月十日在喀喇蚩农业会议的开幕会上说，巴基斯坦必须要使粮食能够自给自足，而且要有大量的存粮，以防荒年危机。
    他说，“我们不能而且不应当长期依赖外援。我们必须生产足够数量的粮食来满足我们的需要，我们必须自立。”
    他特别提到土地改革的重要性，并且说，使耕者从土地中得到真正的一份这个重要问题还有待解决。只有种地的人才能供应我们需要的粮食，然而他们却得不到公平的经济和社会待遇。他还谈到需要改变不能充分鼓励农民生产的税收制度。
    据新华社喀喇蚩讯　巴基斯坦和美国在八月七日签订关于从美国进口谷物的协定。根据这一项协定，巴基斯坦将从美国输入总值四千六百多万美元的谷物和其他商品。美国将把巴基斯坦为此付出的款项的80％用来进行对巴基斯坦的“防御支持”计划。
    巴基斯坦报纸对这项协定深表不满。八月十日乌尔都文“地主报”发表社论说，巴基斯坦人不喜欢美国的小麦、牛奶、干酪以及别的诸如此类的东西。“在过去，从美国已经进口过这种东西，并且起了各种疾病和肠胃不适”。
    社论说，政府进口这些东西是想浪费两亿两千万卢比。“如果把这笔钱作为贷款分配给耕作者的话，他们可以在一年内生产出比从美国进口的数量多一倍的牛奶、干酪和烟草”。
    十一日的乌尔都文“战斗报”刊载了一幅漫画抨击这个协定。这幅漫画画着两个医生在握手并且快乐地说，“美国的小麦又来了”。
