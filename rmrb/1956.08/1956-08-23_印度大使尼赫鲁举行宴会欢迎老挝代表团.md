Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma stated in Beijing tonight that, since the Bandung Conference, the Kingdom of Laos has accepted the Panchsheel Principles, or the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, without reservation, and has adopted a policy of peaceful neutrality within the Kingdom's government that he leads, implementing the Five Principles in practice.

The Prime Minister made these remarks at a banquet hosted by Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, to welcome the Lao Kingdom Government Delegation he is leading. He said that the Kingdom of Laos has no other wish than to live in peace and be on friendly terms with its neighbors.

Speaking of his visit to China, the Prime Minister said, "Today we visit our great neighbor, China, just as we visited India last year, and just as we will visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam tomorrow. We seek peace and friendship everywhere, and we do our best to create an environment of peace and prosperity everywhere. In seeking friendship and understanding, we spare no effort and shrink from no hardship."

The Prime Minister said: "The agreement we have just concluded with the Lao fighting forces makes us optimistic about the future of our country. Because after the conclusion of this agreement, we eliminated the last remnants of the Indochina War."

The Prime Minister also recalled the friendly relations between Laos and India. He said that they appreciate and closely observe India's efforts to fight for world peace. He said that he was happy to praise Prime Minister Nehru's personal contributions.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China also spoke at the banquet. He said that Laos, India, and China are all countries with ancient cultures and have had friendly relations for a long time in history, for nearly two thousand years.

He said that in modern times, our three countries have suffered from the scourge of colonialism. Imperialists started with a very interesting name for this region. They called the region connecting India and China "Indochina," which proves our friendly history. Sure enough, our three countries participated in the armistice of Indochina, which means that we all worked together for the anti-colonialist struggle.

The Premier said that not only that, but our three countries, together with other Asian and African countries, reached the famous declaration of the Ten Principles of Peace at the Bandung Conference.

The Premier said that this time, the visit of Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma to China emphasizes that the Five Principles advocated by India and China are the ties that bind our three countries together.

The Premier added that regardless of the Ten Principles of Bandung or the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we are all for the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world, without excluding any country or being hostile to any nation.

Premier Zhou Enlai wished for the victory of the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and for world peace and friendship among all countries.

The host of the banquet, Ambassador R.K. Nehru, in his speech welcoming Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Lao Kingdom Government Delegation, reviewed the long history of friendly relations between India and Laos and the new friendly relations established after the Geneva Conference, and congratulated Laos on the achievements it has made in its efforts to achieve national unity. He said that His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma stated last night that Laos has unanimously returned to reconciliation, which will enable the Lao government and people to devote themselves more effectively to other tasks. When the Lao people can now concentrate on greater tasks, a country should have a peaceful environment. The Indian Ambassador pointed out that the policy of peaceful neutrality reiterated by Laos in the joint statement after the recent Vientiane talks not only conforms to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but also to the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

The Ambassador further said that the very fact of accepting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence helps to create the necessary conditions for peaceful and friendly international relations. Ambassador Nehru hoped that the visit of the Lao Kingdom Government Delegation to China will contribute to the favorable trend of easing the world situation.

He Long, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian, Vice Premiers of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Huang Yanpei and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and responsible persons of relevant departments were invited to attend the banquet.

Heads of diplomatic missions, commercial representatives, and economic delegations of various countries in China, as well as David Marshall, Chairman of the Singapore Labor Front and former Chief Minister of Singapore, were also invited to attend the banquet.

    印度大使尼赫鲁举行宴会欢迎老挝代表团
    新华社22日讯　老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王今晚在北京说，万隆会议以后，老挝王国毫无保留地接受了潘查希拉原则或和平共处五项原则，并且在他所主持的王国政府中采取了和平中立的政策，把五项原则在事实上履行了。
    这位首相在印度驻华大使拉·库·尼赫鲁为欢迎他率领的老挝王国政府代表团的宴会上说，老挝王国除了和平生活和同邻国和睦相处以外，别无其他愿望。
    首相在谈到访问中国的时候说，我们今天访问我们伟大的邻邦——中国，如同我们去年访问印度一样，也如同明天我们将访问越南民主共和国一样。我们到处寻求和平和友谊，我们到处在尽我们的微力建立和平和繁荣的环境。在寻求友谊和了解的情况下，我们不遗余力，也不辞劳苦。
    首相说：我们刚刚同寮国战斗部队所缔结的协定，使我们对于我国的前途感到乐观。因为这个协定缔结以后，我们就消除了印度支那战争的最后余波。
    这位首相还回述了老挝和印度两国间的友好关系。他说，我们赞赏地注视着印度为世界和平而斗争的努力。他说，他乐于对尼赫鲁总理个人的功绩加以赞扬。
    中华人民共和国总理周恩来也在宴会上讲了话。他说，老挝、印度和中国都是有着古老文化的国家，并且在历史上很早就有来往，差不多都有近两千年历史的友好关系。
    他说，近代以来，我们三个国家都蒙受殖民主义者的祸害，帝国主义者从这一地区起了一个很有趣的名字，他们把将印度和中国联系起来的这个地区叫作印度支那，这就替我们把友好的历史作了证明。果然，印度支那的停战我们三个国家都参加了，这就是说我们都共同为反殖民主义斗争而努力。
    总理说，不仅如此，我们三个国家又在万隆会议上同其他亚非国家一起，达成了著名的十项和平原则的宣言。
    总理说，这次老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王来中国访问，又强调印度、中国倡导的五项原则，是把我们三个国家联系起来的纽带。
    总理又说，不管万隆的十项原则，不管和平共处的五项原则，我们都是为了世界上所有国家和平共处，不排斥任何国家，也不敌视任何民族。
    周恩来总理祝万隆精神和和平共处五项原则的胜利，祝世界和平和各国友好。
    宴会的主人——拉·库·尼赫鲁大使在他的欢迎梭发那·富马亲王和老挝王国政府代表团的讲话中，回顾了印度和老挝两国的悠久的友好历史和在日内瓦会议后建立的新的友好关系，并且祝贺老挝在努力求得全国人民团结中所取得的成就。他说，梭发那·富马亲王殿下在昨晚谈到老挝已全国一致归于和好，这将使得老挝政府和人民能更有效地致力于其他的任务。在老挝人民现在可以专心致力于更伟大的任务的时候，一个国家应当具有一个和平的环境。这位印度大使指出老挝在最近万象会谈后的联合声明所重申的和平中立政策，不但符合和平共处五项原则，而且也符合日内瓦协定的规定。
    大使又说，接受和平共处五项原则这一事实本身就有助于为和平的和友好的国际关系创造必要的条件。尼赫鲁大使希望老挝王国政府代表团的访问中国，将有助于世界局势缓和的有利的趋势。
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、李先念，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长黄炎培、彭真、外交部副部长张闻天和有关部门的负责人应邀出席了宴会。
    各国驻华使节、商务代表和经济代表团团长、以及新加坡劳工阵线主席、前新加坡首席部长戴维·马歇尔也应邀出席了宴会。
