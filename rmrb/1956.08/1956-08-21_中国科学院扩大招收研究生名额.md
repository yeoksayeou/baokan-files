Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is expanding its enrollment of graduate students this year, increasing the originally planned 315 students to 361.

　　The number of scientists serving as supervisors has also increased from 236 to 263. A number of scientists who recently returned from countries such as Britain and the United States are also planning to supervise graduate students.

　　The Chinese Academy of Sciences will simplify the application procedures for graduate student enrollment without lowering the quality. The application process will adopt a free application method. Applicants do not need to submit a letter of consent or recommendation from their original work unit. Applicants only need to submit a graduation certificate and a letter of certification from their university (including students who graduated early). This year's university graduates assigned to units affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences may apply on a voluntary basis, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences requires its affiliated units to provide support. Applicants may choose two majors with the same or similar examination subjects when applying, and the examination will be taken according to the first choice.
