Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 3rd: The autumn rice planting work in northern Vietnam has been basically completed. In the fourth inter-zone, the Northwest Zone, and the Viet Bac Inter-zone provinces, transplanting has been completed in almost all areas. Most areas of the Third Inter-zone and the Left Bank Zone have also completed transplanting.

To complete this year's autumn planting plan, the people of Vietnam have overcome many difficulties. Most of the rice fields in Hai Phong and Hai An counties, which originally had alkaline soil, have been desalinated and planted with seedlings. Good results have also been achieved in drainage and drought resistance work in various places.

Improved planting techniques have also been widely used. Farmers in many places have implemented deep plowing and careful cultivation, warm water soaking, and small-plant planting, and have actively carried out fertilizer accumulation campaigns.

During the autumn planting work, the Vietnamese government has given great assistance to the people in various places. Farmers in many places have received thousands of tons of improved seeds from the government, and the government has also transferred tens of thousands of head of draught cattle from mountainous areas to the plains to support farmers in plowing and reclaiming wasteland. At the same time, the government also organized local farm tool workshops to produce more than 395,000 plows and tens of thousands of harrows, hoes, etc., to support farmers in their autumn planting.

    越南秋稻插秧结束
    据新华社河内3日电　越南北方的秋稻种植工作已经基本完成。在第四联区、西北区和越北联区各省，几乎所有地方的插秧工作都已经结束。第三联区和左岸区的大部分地区也已经插秧完毕。
    为了完成今年的秋种计划，越南各地人民曾经克服了许多困难。原来土壤含碱的海防、海安县大部分稻田已经脱碱，并且插上了秧苗。各地排水、抗旱的工作也取得了良好的成绩。
    改良的种植技术也得到广泛运用，许多地方的农民已经实行深耕细作、温水浸种、小株栽植等，并且积极开展了积肥运动。
    在秋种工作中，越南政府曾经给各地人民很大的帮助。许多地方的农民从政府那里领到了成千吨的良种，政府并且把上万头耕牛从山区调配到平原地带支援农民翻耕和开荒。政府同时还组织了各地的农具作坊生产了三十九万五千多件铧犁和上万件的耙、锄头等，以支援农民的秋种。
