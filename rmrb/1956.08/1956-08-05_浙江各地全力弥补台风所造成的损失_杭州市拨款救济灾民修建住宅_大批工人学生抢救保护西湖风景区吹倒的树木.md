Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th - Zhejiang Province is continuing its rescue and replanting work. Haimen District, which was the first to be hit by the typhoon's landfall, currently has nearly 10,000 people rescuing river embankments and wharf materials. The seawalls and dikes in the coastal areas of the Wenzhou area have remained intact through the joint efforts of the military and civilians. The Longyan Pond in Yuhuan County was breached by the typhoon, but the breach was quickly blocked by the masses. Large numbers of people are continuing to patrol and rescue dangerous sections of the Puyang River, Tiaoxi River, and the lower reaches of the Qiantang River. During the rescue, the leading organs of Zhejiang Province allocated a large number of sacks, wooden stakes, and other flood control materials to support critical construction sites.
    The urban rescue work is proceeding smoothly. Some of the cities that were hit by the typhoon and rainstorms have already provided shelter for the affected residents. Public housing in Shaoxing City has been vacated to provide housing for the disaster victims, and the injured have received treatment. More than 20 households near the No. 3 Branch of the Ningbo Hefeng Textile Factory were trapped in the water and were immediately rescued by the People's Liberation Army. Some of the houses damaged by the typhoon are being repaired, and transportation and telecommunications tools are also being restored.
    The drought that once appeared in Huangyan, Wenling, and Yuhuan counties has now been eliminated, and the drought in some areas has been alleviated and reduced. The rural areas are seizing the opportunity of clear weather after the heavy rain to carry out replanting as quickly as possible.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th - This morning, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee jointly formed two visiting groups to visit YuHang and Fuyang counties, which were severely affected by the typhoon.
    The Provincial Department of Agriculture, financial departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives are vigorously transferring seeds and building materials such as wood and bamboo to supply disaster areas for replanting and building houses. Commercial departments have also made arrangements for the supply of non-staple foods needed by the people.
    In order to solve the problem of food for the people in the disaster area, the Provincial Grain Department decided to allocate a batch of food to the disaster victims. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs allocated another 667,000 yuan in relief funds to 29 counties and cities affected by the typhoon and rainstorm on the evening of the 3rd. Various provincial health departments have also been urgently mobilized to form ten medical and epidemic prevention teams, which have been distributed to areas with serious disasters for rescue. The Provincial Health Department has also prepared a large number of bleaching powder, 666 and other disinfectant and insecticide drugs to allocate to various places to strengthen prevention work.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th - Hangzhou City, which was hit by a strong typhoon, is continuing to take various measures to make up for the serious losses caused by the typhoon. The typhoon that hit Hangzhou City this time had winds of level 12 or higher, and the wind and rain were extremely strong. Although the city and district people's committees had taken precautions in all aspects in advance, the losses were still very large. According to incomplete statistics as of the 3rd, more than 300 people were injured and 83 died throughout the city. Most of the casualties were due to the collapse of houses, and a few were due to electric shock and drowning when the tide came in. 135 civilian ships docked on the Qiantang River were overturned or smashed, and 19 people were unaccounted for. About 5,000 houses collapsed throughout the city due to the typhoon, leaving 20,000 disaster victims. More than 31,000 trees were damaged in scenic spots such as Bai Causeway and Su Causeway, and on both sides of the city's roads. Many large trees were uprooted, some were broken, and most were tilted by the typhoon. Seventeen buildings in famous scenic spots such as the Chuyang Platform, Lingyin Temple, and Qianwang Hall were damaged.
    During the typhoon, nearly 10,000 workers, farmers, government cadres, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Hangzhou City, under the command of the Municipal People's Committee, bravely carried out rescue operations. The affected residents have been temporarily housed in warehouses, schools, and some private houses, and food is provided by the People's Committee. Injured citizens were successively sent to hospitals or first-aid stations. On the 3rd, more than 1,000 gardeners, more than 800 young students, and a large number of government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and residents were working hard to rescue and protect damaged trees and various flowers and plants. On the evening of the 3rd, under the strong electric lights around West Lake, they decided to stay up all night and support all the trees that had been blown down.
    The Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee held an emergency meeting on the 3rd and decided to ask the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee to allocate funds to build 30,000 square meters of housing and allocate 300,000 yuan in relief funds; it suggested that the People's Bank provide long-term low-interest loans to residents to build their own houses. At the meeting, a housing construction committee headed by Vice Mayor Zhou Feng was established to specifically lead the construction work. The meeting also decided that injured citizens would not be charged any fees if they were particularly economically difficult after being sent to the hospital, and only the cost of medicines would be charged if they were not economically difficult. The meeting issued a call to all cadres in the city, urging them to ensure that no one starved to death and that everyone had a house to live in.

    新华社杭州4日电　浙江省各地继续进行抢险抢救和抢种工作。首先遭受台风中心登陆袭击的海门区，目前近万人正在抢救江堤和码头物资。温州专区沿海地区的海堤海塘经过军民协力抢救，全线安然无恙。玉环县龙岩塘为台风冲破缺口，很快就被群众把缺口堵住。浦阳江、苕溪、钱塘江下游等河流各个险工地段，有大批群众坚持巡守和抢救。在抢救期间，浙江省领导机关调拨大批麻袋、木桩等防汛器材支援险要工地。
    城市抢救工作进行的很顺利。有些被台风暴雨侵袭的城市，受灾居民已经得到安置。绍兴市公共房屋已被腾出供给受灾人居住，受伤人员得到治疗。宁波市和丰纱厂第三分厂附近二十多户居民困在水中，被解放军立即抢救出来。有些被台风刮坏的房屋正在修理，交通电讯工具也在修复。
    现在黄岩、温岭、玉环等县一度呈现的旱象已经消除，有些地区旱象也得到缓和和减轻，农村中正抓紧大雨以后天气晴和的时机进行抢种。
    新华社杭州4日电　今晨，中共浙江省委员会和省人民委员会联合组成了两个慰问组，分赴由于台风经过受灾较重的余杭和富阳两县慰问。
    省农业厅、财经部门和供销合作社正大力调运种子和木材、毛竹等建筑器材供应灾区补种和建筑房屋之用。商业部门对人民所需的副食品的供应也做了安排。
    为了解决灾区人民的口粮问题，省粮食部门决定拨出一批口粮给灾民。省民政部门在三日晚上又把六十六万七千元救济款拨给受到台风暴雨侵袭的二十九个县市。省级各个卫生部门也紧急动员起来组成十个医疗防疫队，分发到灾情严重的地区，进行抢救。省卫生厅还准备了大量的漂白粉、六六六等消毒杀虫药品拨给各地，加强预防工作。
    新华社杭州4日电　遭受强大台风侵袭的杭州市正在继续采取各种措施，弥补这次台风所造成的严重损失。这次侵袭杭州市的台风，风力在十二级以上，狂风暴雨异常猛烈，虽然市和各区的人民委员会事先在各个方面做了防范，损失仍然很大。根据到三日为止的不完全统计，全市有三百多人受伤，八十三人死亡，大部分的伤亡是由于房屋被吹塌，少数是由于触电和潮水涌进时淹死。停泊在钱塘江边的民船有135只被打翻或撞碎，十九人不知下落，全市由于台风侵袭而倒塌的房屋有五千间左右，灾民有两万人，在白堤、苏堤等风景区和市区马路两边有三万一千多株树木受到损失，有不少大树连根拔起，有的被刮断，大部分被台风吹得倾斜。著名的名胜如初阳台、灵隐寺、千王殿等十七所建筑受到损失。
    在遭受台风侵袭期间，杭州市有近万工人、农民、机关干部和解放军战士在市人民委员会指挥下，奋不顾身地进行抢救，受灾的居民已经被安置到仓库、学校和一些民房里暂住，并且由人民委员会供给饭食。受伤市民陆续送进了医院或急救站。三日，全市一千多个园林工人、八百多个青年学生和大批的机关干部、解放军战士以及居民，正在努力抢救保护受损树木和各种花木。三日夜晚，在西湖周围强烈的电灯光下，他们决定通宵不睡，把吹倒的树木全部扶植。
    杭州市人民委员会三日召开了紧急会议，决定请浙江省人民委员会拨款建造住宅三万平方公尺，拨救济费三十万元；建议人民银行以长期低利贷款给居民自造房屋。会上还成立了以副市长周峰为首的房屋修建委员会，具体领导修建工作。会议还决定，受伤市民送医院后，经济特别困难的一律不收费用，经济不困难的也只收药费成本。会议向全市所有干部发出号召，一定要做到不饿死一个人，使所有的人都有房子住。
