    Xiang and Li Rivers Have Different Sources
    Li Chuanxin
    "The Xiang and Li Rivers share the same source," this saying is widely known. However, this statement is actually incorrect.

    The Xiang River originates from Haiyang Mountain in Xing'an, and the Li River originates from the Darong River in Xing'an. The sources of the two rivers are a hundred li apart and are not "the same source." It is only the "Ling Canal" that connects the two rivers. The Ling Canal was dug by Shi Lu during the Qin Dynasty, and embankments were built along the banks, which are the famous "Qin Embankments." This man-made Ling Canal can really be called the "Xiang-Li Canal." It is more than fifty li long. Although it is not as magnificent as the Soviet Union's "Volga-Don Canal," the principle is the same. It also shows the wisdom and strength of the ancient working people of our country.

    However, people have always said that the "Xiang and Li Rivers share the same source," and even the locals are used to saying this. At the place where the Xiang River and the Ling Canal are connected, there is a pavilion called "Divergence Pavilion," next to which there is a stone tablet with the four characters "Xiang and Li Rivers Diverge," all of which violate scientific facts. Therefore, the statement in Mr. Hu Peheng's article "Xiang and Li Boundary" published in the People's Daily on July 6 is also inappropriate in my opinion.

    湘漓异源

    “湘漓同源”，这句话已经尽人皆知。但是，这说法其实是错的。
    湘江发源于兴安海阳山，漓江发源于兴安大溶江，两水发源地相距百里，并非“同源”，只不过“灵渠”这一条运河把两水沟通而已。灵渠是秦代史禄所凿，沿岸筑堤，即有名的“秦堤”。这条人工开凿的灵渠，实在可以名为“湘漓运河”，全长五十多里，虽不及苏联“伏尔加河——顿河运河”的宏伟，但其理则一，也可见我国古代劳动人民的智慧和力量。
    但是，人们却一直都说是“湘漓同源”，连当地的人也都这样说惯了。在湘江和灵渠相连的地方，有一亭叫“分水亭”，亭旁有石碣写“湘漓分派”四大字，这些都是违反科学史实的。因此，人民日报七月六日所载胡佩衡先生“湘漓分界”一文，其中的说法我也认为不妥当。
