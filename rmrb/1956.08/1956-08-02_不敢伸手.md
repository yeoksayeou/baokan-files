    Afraid to Raise a Hand
    In Monteria, USA, a car driver blamed his traffic violation on the ongoing local government elections. He told the police with a straight face that he didn't signal when turning because he was "afraid that if he raised his hand, all the candidates would rush onto the road to shake hands with him."
    This is a small news item published in a recent issue of the American "Time" magazine. From this small news item, people can imagine the ugly state of American politicians currying favor with voters and vying for votes in an election year.

    不敢伸手
    在美国蒙特里亚城，一个汽车司机把他违反交通规则原因归咎正在进行的地方政府选举，他理直气壮地对警察说，汽车转弯时他没有伸手作信号，是因为“害怕如果伸出手来，所有候选人都要跑到马路上抢着和我握手”。
    这是登在最近一期美国“时代”周刊上的一条小新闻。从这条小新闻里，人们可以想像在选举年里，美国政客们笼络选民和争夺选票的丑态。
