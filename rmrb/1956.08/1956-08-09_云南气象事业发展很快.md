    Yunnan Meteorological Undertakings Develop Rapidly
    (Our newspaper, Kunming) With the development and needs of industry and agriculture, Yunnan's meteorological undertakings have also greatly developed in recent years. It has developed from five meteorological stations before liberation to forty-seven, and will develop to eighty by the end of this year. The meteorological data issued by these meteorological stations to the outside world has also increased from the original two or three units to 114. At present, the accuracy of meteorological forecasting work in Yunnan Province can reach 80%. The meteorological stations in various parts of Yunnan issue weather forecasts in a timely manner, which are deeply welcomed by the broad masses of people. For example, at the end of July, Yunnan was continuously rainy. The Yuxi County granary planned to roast 500,000 catties of wheat with fire. After hearing the forecast of sunny weather in the mid-term (meaning two or three days), they changed to sun drying, which saved a lot of firewood costs. After hearing that it would be sunny, the cadres of Yangchang Xiaocun in Jinlong Township, Qixiqu, Kunming City, organized the masses to rush to harvest more than 150 mu of wheat. In Xishuangbanna, the masses asked the meteorological station about the weather when they wanted to harvest crops, hold meetings, or go to the streets. The establishment of these meteorological stations and the ability to accurately predict the weather have changed the superstitious ideas of many people, and made the broad masses of people more believe in science.

    云南气象事业发展很快
    本报昆明讯　随着工农业的发展和需要，近几年来云南的气象事业也有很大的发展。它已从解放前的五个气象台站发展到四十七个，今年底将发展到八十个。这些气象台站对外发的气象资料也由原来的二、三个单位增加到114个。现在云南省气象预报工作，准确程度能做到80％。云南各地的气象台站及时发布气象预报，深为广大群众所欢迎。如七月底云南阴雨连绵，玉溪县粮库拟用火烤的五十万斤小麦，在听到预报中期（即两三天的意思）天晴的消息后，即改为太阳晒，这样节约了很多柴火费。昆明市七区金龙乡羊肠小村的干部听到要天晴后，即组织群众抢收了一百五十多亩小麦。在西双版纳，群众要收割庄稼、开会、上街都到气象站问天气。这些气象台站的建立和能准确地预报天气的阴晴，改变了不少人们迷天信鬼的思想，使广大群众更加相信了科学。　（卢雨亭）
