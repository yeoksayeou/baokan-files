    Robertson Waits for "Time"

    American cold war diplomats, not daring to openly oppose peaceful coexistence, have always wanted to use ideological differences to sow seeds of discord. They have repeatedly argued that the Communists are unwilling to abandon communism, which is why socialist countries should not be trusted and should not have friendly relations with them.

    Recently, Walter Robertson, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, once again performed this clumsy trick. This time, however, he resorted to Rudyard Kipling's verses, drawing a conclusion that "makes us extremely uneasy today."

    Robertson nostalgically recalled the "good old days" when colonialism safely ruled the East. Robertson said that at that time, the West "almost everyone, when talking about the Far East, always began by quoting Kipling's famous lines: 'Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.'"

    But, unfortunately, the days when colonialists could do whatever they wanted in the East were not so "eternal." Robertson admitted that the end of such days has finally arrived, and the East has stood up and "met" the West, thus "suddenly generating a large number of significant problems." What are these problems? The first one on his list of "problems" is "a deep hatred of Western colonialism," and, of course, what particularly makes Robertson gnash his teeth is the liberation of the Chinese people and the growing international status of New China.

    In order to provoke suspicion and hatred among the people of other countries towards the people of socialist countries, Robertson tried his best to portray the liberation of the Chinese people and the peaceful foreign policy of People's China as a "threat to the Far East," even containing the danger of "encircling the United States." He also contrasted the liberation of the people of China, Vietnam, and other countries with the fact that many other Asian and African countries "freed themselves from dependence on Western countries and gained freedom and independence" after the war. But he could not but include the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard peace and promote international cooperation, along with the Eastern anti-colonialist struggle, as "problems" that the colonialists "encountered" in the East. In this way, Robertson slapped himself in the face, admitting that the struggle for independence, freedom, and lasting peace led by communists or nationalists in various Eastern countries is a fatal blow to colonialists and instigators of war.

    That is precisely the fact. The people of many countries in Asia and Africa have broken the shackles of imperialism and embarked on the road of independent development. Moreover, due to this common destiny and struggle, Asian and African countries have become increasingly closely united on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. No matter how Robertson and his ilk try to use ideology to provoke and undermine this friendly and cooperative relationship, they cannot prevent the Five Principles from taking root in people's hearts and the influence of the ideas of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation from continuing to expand.

    Prime Minister Nehru recently criticized the United States' Cold War policy of "encouraging hatred, suspicion, and fear of others." He opposed considering the conflict between East and West from an ideological point of view and pointed out sharply that the United States' forcing others to comply with its will is fueling the division of the world into two hostile camps. These words of Prime Minister Nehru prove that Cold War propaganda, which is deliberately peddling outdated anti-communist goods, is increasingly losing its market in Asia and Africa.

    But the Cold War diplomats, who have been repeatedly frustrated, still stubbornly reiterate that "the United States will never admit defeat." Robertson wants to cheer up the colonialists, but he is struggling to find facts that can encourage them, so he has no choice but to tell them: "Time is on our side." This is what Robertson expects. However, in expressing such confidence, Robertson has overlooked the most fundamental fact, which is that the clock of history is turning in the opposite direction to what he is pointing to. And it is this very fact that dooms the "confidence" of Robertson and his ilk to utter failure. (Jin)

### 罗伯逊等待的“时间”

    罗伯逊等待的“时间”
    美国冷战外交家不敢公开反对共处，一直想利用意识形态方面的不同散播不和的种子。他们一再地争辩着说：共产党人不愿意离开共产主义，这就是不应该信任社会主义国家并同它们友好相处的根据。
    最近，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊，就又一次表演了这种拙劣手法。不过，这一回，他求助于吉卜林的诗句，得出了一个“使我们今天极感不安”的结论。
    罗伯逊不胜感慨地想念到殖民主义安然统治东方的“过去的好日子”。罗伯逊说，那时西方“差不多每一个人在谈到远东时一开头总是引述吉卜林的著名诗句：‘东方是东方，西方是西方，两者永远不会碰头’。”
    但是，不幸，殖民主义者在东方为所欲为的日子并不是这样“永远”的。罗伯逊承认，这种日子的尽头终于已经到来了，东方站起来和西方“会了面”，从而“一下子产生了一大批重大的问题”。是些什么问题呢？列在他的“问题”中的第一个是，“深深地憎恶西方的殖民主义”，同时，当然特别使罗伯逊切齿痛恨的是中国人民的解放和新中国国际地位的蒸蒸日上。
    罗伯逊为了挑拨其他国家人民对社会主义国家人民的猜疑和仇恨，竭力想把中国人民的解放和人民中国的和平外交政策描绘为“对远东的威胁”，甚至包含“包围美国”的危险。他还把中国、越南等国人民的解放，同战后另外许多亚非国家人民“摆脱了依赖西方国家的地位而获得了自由和独立”对立起来。但他又不能不把中国人民维护和平和促进国际合作的斗争同东方反殖民主义斗争，一起列为殖民主义者在东方所“碰”到的“问题”。这样，罗伯逊就等于自己打了自己一个巴掌，承认不论是共产主义者或是民族主义者所领导的东方各国争取独立自由和持久和平的斗争，都是对殖民主义者和战争挑拨者的致命打击。
    事实正是如此。亚洲和非洲许多国家的人民都已折断了帝国主义的枷锁，走上独立发展的大道。而且，由于这共同的命运和斗争，亚非国家已在和平共处五项原则的基础上日益紧密地结合在一起。尽管罗伯逊之流怎样想利用意识形态来挑拨和破坏这个友好合作的关系，都不能阻止五项原则的深入人心、和平共处和国际合作的思想的影响的不断扩大。
    尼赫鲁总理最近就抨击了美国“鼓励对别人的仇恨、猜疑和恐惧”的冷战政策。他反对从意识形态的观点出发来考虑东西方的冲突，并一针见血地指出，美国强使别人遵从它的意志，正在助长把世界分裂为两个敌对阵营。尼赫鲁总理的这些话，证明别有用心地推销反共的背时货的冷战宣传，在亚非地区已经越来越没有市场了。
    但一再遭到挫败的冷战外交家，仍然硬着头皮重申“美国决不会承认失败”。罗伯逊要给殖民主义者打气，而又苦于找不到可以使他们得到鼓舞的事实，就只好告诉他们说：“时间是有利于我们的”。罗伯逊这样期望着。可是，罗伯逊在表示这样的信心时，忽略了一个最根本的事实，就是历史的时针是向着他所指的相反的方向旋转的。而正是这个事实，注定了罗伯逊之流的“信心”要全部落空。　（今）
