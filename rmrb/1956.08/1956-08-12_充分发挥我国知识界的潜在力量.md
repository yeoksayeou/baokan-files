    According to the instructions of the State Council, five agencies, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the State Technological Commission, and the State Council Expert Bureau, issued a joint announcement on the recruitment of scientific research personnel, teaching and educational administrative personnel for higher and secondary schools, technical personnel, and translators. This is an important measure to implement the Party and the state's policy towards intellectuals and further give play to the potential strength of China's intellectual circles. Through this recruitment, senior intellectuals in society who have not yet found employment will have broad employment opportunities, and some experts who are inappropriately assigned will also receive necessary adjustments. This will greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the broad intellectual circles and have a positive effect on the country's economic and cultural construction.
    The targets of this recruitment are primarily senior intellectuals in society who have not yet found employment. According to investigations in various regions in recent months, there are many senior intellectuals in society who have employment conditions but have not yet found employment. Among the intellectuals in Beijing who were surveyed before May this year and had not yet found employment, 2,321 had a university education, including 1,482 university graduates, 771 university dropouts, and 68 others. Among them, 375 were engaged in the study of natural sciences and engineering technology, 1,349 in social sciences and language and education, and 597 in other departments. Beijing is absorbing these people into employment, and by the end of July, the materials of 1,825 people had been sent to various employing departments. 317 people have been confirmed for employment, and the rest are being reviewed and prepared for employment.
    The materials from various places generally reflect that these unemployed intellectuals have seen the vigorous development of socialist construction and are all eager to participate in the work and are willing to dedicate their efforts to national construction; the reasons why they have not been employed are various. Some are because they are older and in poor health; some are because they have had some political and historical problems; and some are because they have ideological concerns or some family burdens. However, some agencies also have a bias towards excessively high requirements in recruiting personnel. For people with more complicated political history and social relations, and those who are older, in poor health, or have heavy family burdens, even if they have the ability to work, they are generally unwilling to employ them. This is wrong. We should recognize that these people have made considerable progress and changes in recent years, and we should use the strength of these intellectuals who have not yet been employed in accordance with the needs of work development.
    In this recruitment and in future employment, excessively high health requirements should not be the primary consideration for applicants. As long as the body is generally healthy and can work regularly, it can be employed. As long as they have certain expertise and can be competent in their work, even if they are old and weak, they can be given regular or quantitative work according to the specific situation, such as teaching a few hours of classes at a school, doing some research work or translation work, and so on. On the issue of political history and social relations, we must strictly abide by the guiding principles in Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the issue of intellectuals. As long as the person is not currently a counter-revolutionary, although social relations are complicated, the person has no problems, or although there were problems in the past, they have made appropriate confessions, and those who only have general political and historical problems and the circumstances are not serious, should all be employed according to their talents and given appropriate work to give play to their strength. After employment, the staff of the relevant departments must earnestly unite this group of senior intellectuals who have newly joined the work politically and help them overcome difficulties in their work. We should not force uniformity in personal habits and styles. For those who are older, weaker, and have heavy family burdens, especially women with children, special care should be given, such as allowing them to freely dispose of their spare time and not forcing them to participate in collective activities and collective learning, etc.
    On the other hand, the employed personnel should also recognize that they have certain expertise and skills, which are very good working conditions. However, because they joined the work late, they must humbly learn and continuously improve their political and professional level through practice, pay attention to contacting the masses, and conduct self-education and self-transformation through criticism and self-criticism, so as to better exert their strength and serve the people.
    Among the experts in service and other senior intellectuals, if they are suitable for scientific research, teaching, specialized technical work, or translation work, but their current work is not appropriately assigned, and they are not using their expertise, those who request adjustments may also apply through their original units or be introduced by their original units.
    Since the Central Committee convened the conference on the issue of intellectuals, the situation of inappropriate use of senior intellectuals in many institutions and enterprises has been further improved; however, there are still some people whose work is not assigned appropriately and cannot give play to their expertise. Some students who have studied abroad could have taught in universities or done scientific research, but are now doing general administrative work in institutions; one student who studied in Japan and specialized in aircraft repair was originally a first-class engineer, but was left in a training class of an institution to teach; a epigrapher works as a food administrator in an institution. What is more noteworthy is that after these unreasonable situations are discovered, obstacles are often encountered during the adjustment. This kind of departmentalism must be opposed. It is hoped that all departments will cooperate with this recruitment work, and that leading comrades will personally check the arrangement and use of experts and senior intellectuals in their own units, and actively recommend and introduce those who are inappropriately arranged and used and cannot be adjusted by their own units to apply. If some people's work arrangements are indeed very inappropriate, and their units cannot adjust them, and the individual requests to apply, but the work department does not introduce them but prevents them, then the individual can directly register with the recruitment committee to apply, and the recruitment committee should accept it. Of course, the adjustment of work for engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines should not hinder production. Therefore, although the work of some people does need to be adjusted, their application should also be agreed to by the leadership of their unit, so that the leadership can make arrangements for personnel adjustments, so as not to affect production work.
    The personnel recruited this time must be distributed according to their knowledge, technical ability and the needs of the country, and taking into account their personal wishes. Only in this way can we make the best use of their talents. In general, work can be assigned locally, which is beneficial to both the country and the employed personnel. Among them, those with special expertise needed by the central government agencies should be arranged by the central government agencies; those who need to be assigned to other areas and have no special difficulties should obey the transfer. In addition, those who do not yet have employment conditions should actively prepare for employment conditions and strive to participate in work as soon as possible.

### 充分发挥我国知识界的潜在力量

    充分发挥我国知识界的潜在力量
    根据国务院的指示，中国科学院、高等教育部、教育部、国家技术委员会、国务院专家局等五个机关，发布了联合招聘科学研究人员、高等和中等学校教学和教育行政人员、技术人员以及翻译人员的通告。这是贯彻执行党和国家对知识分子的政策，进一步发挥我国知识界的潜在力量的一项重要措施。通过这次招聘工作，将使社会上还没有就业的高级知识分子获得广泛的就业机会，一部分工作安排不当的在职专家也将得到必要的调整。这样就会大大地激发广大知识界的积极性，对国家的经济、文化建设事业发生良好的作用。
    这次招聘的对象，首先是社会上还没有就业的高级知识分子。根据最近几个月各地的调查，社会上有不少具有就业条件的高级知识分子还没有就业。北京市今年五月以前调查还没有就业的知识分子中，具有大学程度的就有2，321人，其中大学毕业的1，482人，大学肄业的771人，其他68人。他们中间研究自然科学和工程技术的有375人，社会科学和语文、教育的有1，349人，属于其他科系的597人。北京市正在吸收这些人就业，截止七月底，已将1，825人的材料送往各用人部门。已经确定录用的317人，其余正在审查，准备录用。
    各地材料普遍反映，这些未就业的知识分子看到了社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展，都热烈地要求参加工作，愿意为国家建设献出自己的力量；而他们所以未能就业，有各种原因。有的是因为年龄较大，身体不好；有的是因为有过一些政治历史问题；还有一些人是因为个人思想上存在着顾虑或有一些家累。但有些机关在录用人员上，也有要求过高的偏向。对于政治历史、社会关系比较复杂的人和年纪较大、身体较差或者家累较重的人，虽然他们有工作能力，一般都不愿录用。这是不对的。我们应当承认这些人几年来已有相当的进步和变化，应当按照工作发展的需要，把这些还没有就业的知识分子的力量使用起来。
    在这次招聘中以及将来聘用以后，对于应聘人员的健康条件首先不应要求过高。身体一般健康，能够经常工作，就可以聘用。只要有一定专长，工作能够胜任，即使年老体弱，也可以根据具体情况，给予定期或定量的工作，如在学校担任几个钟头的课，作一部分研究工作或翻译工作等等。对于政治历史和社会关系问题，必须严格遵守周恩来同志关于知识分子问题报告中的指示原则。只要本人现在不是反革命分子，社会关系虽然复杂，但是本人并无问题，或者过去虽有过问题，但已经作了适当交代，以及只有一般政治历史问题，情节不重的人，都应该量才聘用，给以适当工作，以发挥他们的力量。在聘用以后，有关部门的工作人员，必须认真地从政治上去团结这一批新参加工作的高级知识分子，帮助他们克服工作中的困难。对于个人的生活习惯和作风，不应该去强求一致。对于年龄较大、身体较弱和家庭负担较重的人，尤其是有子女的妇女，都应当特别给以照顾，如业余时间完全由他们自由支配，不勉强他们参加集体活动和集体学习，等等。
    另一方面，被聘用人员也应当认识到，自己具有一定的专长和技能，这是很好的工作条件，但是，由于参加工作较晚，必须虚心学习，通过实践，不断提高自己的政治水平和业务水平，注意联系群众，用批评和自我批评的方法进行自我教育和自我改造，以便更好地发挥自己的力量，为人民服务。
    在职专家和其他高级知识分子中，如果有适合于作科学研究工作、教学工作、专门技术工作或翻译工作，而目前他们的工作又分配得很不适当，用非所学，要求调整的人，由原单位提出或是由本人申请经原单位介绍，也可以应聘。
    自从中央召开知识分子问题会议以后，很多机关企业中，对于高级知识分子使用不当的情形已有进一步的改善；但是，也还有一些人的工作分配得不尽适当，不能发挥他们专长。有的留学生，本来可以在大学里教书或作科学研究工作，但现在做了机关的一般行政工作；有一位留日学生，专攻飞机修造，原是一级工程师，却被留在一个机关的训练班里教书；一位金石学专家，在一个机关当伙食管理员。更值得引起注意的，是这些不合理的情况被发现以后，在调整的时候还常常遇到阻碍。这种本位主义思想必须反对。希望各部门能够配合这次招聘工作，由领导同志亲自动手，检查一下本单位对专家和高级知识分子的安排和使用情况，对那些安排和使用不当，本单位又无法调整的人，应该主动地推荐出来，介绍他们应聘。如果有些人工作安排确实很不适当，本单位又无法调整，本人请求应聘，工作部门不予介绍反而加以阻止，那末，本人可以直接向招聘委员会报名应聘，招聘委员会应该接受。当然，在厂矿生产单位中的工程技术人员，调整工作不能妨碍生产。因此虽然有些人的工作确实需要调整，但在他们申请应聘的时候，也要得到本单位领导上的同意，让领导上对于人事调整有所安排，以免影响生产工作。
    对这次招聘来的人员，必须依据本人学识、技术才能和国家的需要，并照顾本人志愿进行分配。只有这样，才能做到人尽其才。分配中一般可以就原地分配工作，这对国家和被聘用人员双方都有好处。其中有特殊专长而为中央机关所需要的，应由中央机关安排；有的需要分配到其他地区本人又没有特殊困难的，应当服从调配。此外，暂时还没有就业条件的人，应该积极准备就业条件，争取早日参加工作。
