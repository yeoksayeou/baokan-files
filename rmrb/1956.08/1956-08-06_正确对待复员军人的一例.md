An Example of Correctly Treating Demobilized Soldiers

The placement work for demobilized soldiers should include two aspects. On the one hand, actively help them solve their living and employment problems; on the other hand, help them continuously improve ideologically, politically, culturally, and professionally. That is to say, attention should be paid to cultivating and educating them. The work of placing demobilized soldiers in Funing County, Hebei Province, is a good example of correctly treating demobilized soldiers, which can be used as a reference for various places.

Since the beginning of the work of placing demobilized soldiers in Funing County, a total of 3,318 demobilized soldiers have been received. These people have not only been properly placed, but many demobilized soldiers have made new achievements in production and various work positions.

The placement work of demobilized soldiers in Funing County was not done well from the beginning. Before 1954, the county leaders regarded this work as too simple, thinking that placing demobilized soldiers was just issuing letters of introduction and sending them to the townships. What was the result? Many demobilized soldiers had difficulties in production and life, but the township cadres "respected and stayed away" from these demobilized soldiers and did not actively help them solve their difficulties. Therefore, some demobilized soldiers had disagreements with the township cadres and even accused the district, county, and provincial people's committees, and even accused the central government. As a result, the lower levels searched and the upper levels urged, putting the county in a very passive position.

The problem was in front of them. What attitude did the Funing County Committee of the Communist Party of China take? They did not blame the demobilized soldiers for being "naughty," nor did they complain that the demobilized soldiers added "trouble" to them, but instead examined their own work. The reason why the previous resettlement work of demobilized soldiers was not done well was mainly because the leading cadres and most of the cadres did not understand the important significance of this work and only handed it over to a few civil affairs workers. Therefore, they immediately strengthened the organization of the Transfer and Construction Committee and inspected the work of resettling demobilized soldiers at district chief meetings, civil affairs assistant meetings, township cadre meetings, and mass meetings. The county leaders made self-criticisms, and the behavior of Zhang Hongguang, a Communist Party member of a unit in Chengguan District, who had consistently attacked demobilized soldiers, was publicly criticized. The county party committee also made a regulation: from the county party committee members to other cadres, no matter who goes to the countryside to inspect work, they must understand the resettlement of demobilized soldiers. Through these measures, a kind of atmosphere of caring for demobilized soldiers was created from top to bottom.

When specifically placing demobilized soldiers, Funing County thoroughly implemented the policy of "warm welcome, close unity, and bold use." In advance, according to the public property situation and the list of demobilized soldiers notified by the troops, cadres were sent to the townships and villages to assist the grassroots cadres in making good placement plans. When the demobilized soldiers arrived, welcome and condolences were organized, and sometimes the county magistrate himself went to welcome them. In helping to solve the specific difficulties of demobilized soldiers, the principle of supplementing what is lacking was implemented. This made the demobilized soldiers feel warm. For example, the demobilized soldier Miao Yuqing was homeless, so the county found him three houses in his hometown of Songzhuang Township and added some furniture. The agricultural cooperative also incorporated him into the production team. On the day he moved into his new home, the village party secretary, the director of the women's association, and others came to help, some cleaning the courtyard and some laying the kang mat. When Miao Yuqing arrived home, he saw that everything was properly arranged, as if there was a warm family there, and he was deeply moved. The day after arriving home, he actively participated in the production team.

While the vast majority of demobilized soldiers were placed to participate in agricultural production, vocational placement was also carried out for demobilized soldiers with specialized skills and those with a junior high school education or above. The county's directly affiliated organs implemented the principle of giving priority to employing demobilized soldiers. When each unit lacked people, they took the initiative to contact the civil affairs department and the transfer and construction department; in this way, 225 demobilized soldiers were recruited to participate in work in the first half of this year. When the county purchasing bureau added new personnel, it recruited 21 people at one time, 17 of whom became cadres.

The leaders of Funing County helped demobilized soldiers suffering from various diseases to receive treatment. Most of the demobilized soldiers who were suffering from various chronic diseases at the end of 1955 have now recovered their health. Of the 318 unmarried demobilized soldiers received in 1955, 272 have been married and established happy families.

However, even if problems such as placement, medical treatment, and marriage are solved, problems will still occur if the cultivation and education of demobilized soldiers are relaxed. There was a period in Funing County when this issue was not noticed. Therefore, some people were not at ease with agricultural production, and some people committed illegal and undisciplined acts. The county party committee accepted this lesson. Since 1955, in addition to instructing the grassroots organizations of townships and villages to pay attention to the education of demobilized soldiers, it also specifically built demobilized soldier study stations in Chengguan, Haiyang, and other townships, and selected people with strong abilities and certain prestige among the demobilized soldiers to serve as political instructors; sometimes, leaders and cadres from the county and districts also went to teach classes. This had a very good effect. Six demobilized soldiers in Shuangling Township were originally not at ease with agricultural production. After studying, they improved their understanding and were at ease in actively learning agricultural production techniques. Now, 62 study stations have been established in the county, with 1,050 people participating in learning year-round; in addition, 1,396 people are participating in literacy learning.

In March of this year, the county also gathered 37 demobilized soldiers with more serious ideological problems to study. At the same time, 18 demobilized soldier backbones were selected to participate, taking them as examples, exchanging ideas, and conducting self-education. After the patient help of leaders and other comrades, most people made self-criticisms and corrected their understanding. For example, the demobilized soldier Wang Zhanting not only did not work hard in production in the past, but also defrauded the masses of money; after studying, he realized his mistakes, and after returning to his hometown, he took the initiative to confess to the cadres and actively participated in production and helped the cadres with their work.

In addition, staff members of the units where they work also help demobilized soldiers who participate in the work of the organs to become familiar with their work. The demobilized soldier Lu Shen was assigned to work in the Finance and Trade Department of the County Party Committee in March last year. With everyone's help, he became familiar with all the work within a month and was selected as a representative to attend the Hebei Provincial Socialist Construction Activists Conference. More than 200 demobilized soldiers employed in various agencies are generally competent, and more than 50 have been promoted to leadership positions.

Now, the demobilized soldiers in Funing County have become a powerful new force in agricultural production and other work positions. According to the statistical materials of Funing County, the activists who have emerged have reached 66.5% of the total number of demobilized soldiers.

    正确对待复员军人的一例
    对复员军人的安置工作，应当包括两个方面。一方面是积极设法帮助他们解决生活问题和就业问题；另一方面是帮助他们在思想上、政治上以至文化上、业务上不断提高，这就是说，要注意培养和教育他们。河北省抚宁县安置复员军人的工作，是正确对待复员军人的一个较好的例子，可供各地参考。
    抚宁县安置复员军人的工作开始以来，共接收了复员军人3，318人，这些人不仅得到了妥善的安置，有很多复员军人在生产和各个工作岗位上作出了新的成就。
    抚宁县的复员军人安置工作也并不是一开始就做得好的，在1954年以前，县的领导人员曾把这个工作看得过分简单，认为安置复员军人，只不过是开开介绍信，介绍到乡就算完了。结果怎样呢？不少复员军人在生产和生活上有困难，乡干部对这些复员军人却是“敬而远之”，不去积极地帮助他们解决困难，因此，有些复员军人就和乡干部闹意见，并且控告区、县、省人民委员会，甚至控告到中央。于是下边找，上边催，使县里处在非常被动的地位。
    问题摆在面前了，中共抚宁县委采取什么态度呢？他们不是去怪复员军人“调皮”，不是去埋怨复员军人给他们添“麻烦”，而是检查了自己的工作，过去的复员安置工作所以没有做好，主要是领导干部和大多数干部不了解这一工作的重要意义，只是交给少数民政工作人员去做。于是他们立即加强了转业建设委员会的机构，并且分别在区长会议、民政助理会议、乡干部会议、群众大会上，检查了安置复员军人的工作，县领导上作了自我批评，对城关区某单位的共产党员张宏光一贯打击复员军人的行为进行了公开的批评。县委又作出一条规定：从县委委员到其他干部，不管谁下乡检查工作，都要了解复员军人的安置情况。通过这些措施，从上到下造成了一种关心复员军人的风气。
    在具体安置复员军人的时候，抚宁县深入地贯彻了“热情欢迎、亲密团结、大胆使用”的方针。事先根据公产情况和部队通知的复员军人名单，派干部深入到乡、村，协助基层干部作好安置计划。在复员军人到来的时候，又组织了欢迎慰问，有时，县长自己也去欢迎。在帮助解决复员军人的具体困难上，贯彻了缺啥补啥的原则。这样就使复员军人感到了温暖。例如：复员军人苗雨清无家可归，县里就在苗雨清的原籍宋庄乡，给他找了三间房，并且添置了一些家具，农业合作社又把他编入了生产队。迁入新居那天，村支书、妇女主任等人都来帮忙，有的打扫屋院，有的铺炕席。苗雨清到家一看，样样安置妥当，好像原来就有温暖的家庭一样，深受感动。在到家后的第二天，就积极参加了生产队。
    在绝大多数复员军人被安置参加农业生产的同时，对于有专门技术和有初中以上文化程度的复员军人还进行了职业安置，县的直属机关贯彻了优先录用复员军人的原则。各单位缺人时，都主动到民政部门、转业建设部门去联系；这样，今年上半年就吸收了225名复员军人参加了工作，县采购局在增添新人员时，一次就吸收了二十一名，其中有十七人当了干部。
    对患有各种疾病的复员军人，抚宁县领导上帮助他们治病。1955年年底还患着各种慢性疾病的复员军人，现在已经大部分恢复了健康。1955年接收的318名未婚的复员军人，已有272名结了婚，建立了美满的家庭。
    但是，尽管安置、治病、婚姻等问题都解决了，如果放松了对复员军人的培养教育，也还会发生问题。抚宁县曾经有一个时期，没有注意到这个问题。因此，就有一部分人不安心农业生产，有些人发生了违法乱纪的行为。县委接受了这个教训，从1955年开始，除了责成乡、村基层组织经常注意对复员军人的教育外，还特地在城关、海洋等乡，试建了复员军人学习站，由复员军人中选出能力较强有一定威望的人作政治教员；有时县、区的领导干部也去上课。这样做效果很好，双岭乡原来有六名复员军人不安心农业生产，经过学习以后，提高了认识：安心积极学习农业生产技术。现在全县已建立了六十二个学习站，有1，050人常年参加学习；另外，还有1，396人参加扫盲学习。
    今年三月，县里又把三十七名有较严重思想毛病的复员军人集中起来，进行学习。同时，抽调了十八名复员军人的骨干分子参加，以他们为榜样，互相交换思想情况，进行自我教育。经过领导人员和其他同志的耐心帮助，绝大部分人都进行了自我批评，端正了认识。例如：复员军人王占庭，过去不但不好好劳动生产，还骗取群众钱财；学习以后，他认识了自己的错误，回乡后就主动找干部作了检讨，并积极参加生产，帮助干部工作。
    此外，对参加机关工作的复员军人，也由所在单位的工作人员帮助他们熟悉业务。复员军人鲁深在去年三月被分配到县委财贸部工作，在大家帮助之下，一个月以后，就熟悉了全部业务工作，并且被选为出席河北省社会主义建设积极分子会议的代表。在各个机关中就业的二百多名复员军人，一般都能称职，有五十余名已被提拔为领导工作人员。
    现在，抚宁县的复员军人，在农业生产及其他工作岗位上，已成为一支有力的生力军，根据抚宁县的统计材料，已经涌现出来的积极分子，达到复员军人总数的66.5％。		（徐述荣、王胜波、周相武、张恳久、徐作震）
