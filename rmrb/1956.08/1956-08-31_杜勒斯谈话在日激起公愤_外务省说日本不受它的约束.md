Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: News from Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced to the Diet today that Japan is not bound by Dulles's remarks of August 28 during the Japanese-Soviet negotiations.
    The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet met today to deliberate on issues such as the Japanese-Soviet negotiations. Both ruling and opposition party members expressed indignation at Dulles's remarks in their speeches. Japanese legislators demanded that the government clarify whether it is bound by Dulles's remarks.
    Takahashi, Acting Director-General of the Treaty Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, pointed out in response to inquiries that the obligations assumed by Japan under Article 27 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which came into effect in 1952, are valid for three years. He further pointed out that even before the expiration of the term of obligation, Japan is not bound by this clause on special issues such as territorial issues.
    At the same time, Acting Foreign Minister Takasaki Tatsunosuke acknowledged that the Japanese "inherent territory" is not included in the Kuril Islands that Japan has already renounced.
    Liberal Democratic Party member Etsujiro Uehara criticized Dulles's remarks in his inquiry as "greatly offending the feelings of the Japanese people." He also said that it is meaningless to convene an international conference to decide the sovereignty of the Kuril Islands, because no major power is willing to involve itself in such a troublesome matter.

    杜勒斯谈话在日激起公愤
    外务省说日本不受它的约束
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本外务省今天向国会宣布，日本在日苏谈判中并不受杜勒斯8月28日的谈话的约束。
    日本国会众议院外务委员会今天开会审议了日苏谈判等问题。执政党和在野党的议员在发言中都对杜勒斯的谈话感到激愤。日本议员要求政府说明它是否受杜勒斯谈话的约束。
    外务省代理条约局局长高桥在答复质询时指出，1952年生效的旧金山和约的第二十七条所规定的日本所担承的义务，有效期限是三年。他进一步指出，即使在担承义务的期限未满的情况下，日本在领土问题等特殊问题上也不受这个条款的约束。
    同时，代理外务相高碕达之助承认，在日本已经放弃的千岛群岛中，并不包括日本的“固有领土”。
    自由民主党议员植原悦二郎在质询中指责杜勒斯的谈话“大大地触犯了日本人民的感情”。他并且说，关于召开国际会议来决定千岛群岛的主权是没有意义的，因为没有一个大国愿意把自己牵连到这种麻烦的事情中去。
