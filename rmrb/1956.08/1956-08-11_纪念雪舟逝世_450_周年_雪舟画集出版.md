Xinhua News Agency, 9th. To commemorate the 450th anniversary of the death of Sesshū, a world cultural figure and great Japanese painter, a specially printed art collection was published on the 8th by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House.

Guo Moruo wrote a dedication for this exquisite art collection, praising the cultural exchange and friendship between China and Japan. The Chinese painter Fu Baoshi created a portrait of Sesshū and wrote an article introducing Sesshū's life and artistic achievements.

The art collection includes over forty of Sesshū's famous paintings, including beautiful landscape paintings, lifelike flower and bird paintings, and realistic portrait paintings. From this art collection, one can see Sesshū's artistic talent and the breadth of his selection of subjects. His landscape paintings are particularly outstanding, sometimes employing some of the techniques of the Chinese Song Dynasty painters Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, boldly using texturing and striking, and sometimes using the splashed-ink painting methods of Ming Dynasty painters such as Li Zai, creating a unique style. The art collection includes Sesshū's representative works "Landscape Handscroll," "Four Seasons Landscape," and "Autumn and Winter Landscape," which fully demonstrate the characteristics of landscape painting in terms of composition and perspective. Whether it is deep mountains and secluded valleys, or beautiful rivers, they are expressed with both grandeur and sentiment. Two landscape paintings in the art collection are woodcut color prints made by Rong Bao Zhai Xin Ji, an old Beijing art workshop.

    纪念雪舟逝世450周年
    雪舟画集出版
    新华社9日电　纪念世界文化名人、日本伟大画家雪舟逝世四百五十周年特印画集，八日由人民美术出版社出版。
    郭沫若为这部精美的画集题词，歌颂中、日两国文化交流和人民友谊。国画家傅抱石作雪舟画像，并著文介绍雪舟的生平和艺术成就。
    画集中选辑了雪舟名画四十多幅，有优美的山水画、栩栩如生的花鸟画，以及逼真的肖像画等。从这个画集可以看出雪舟的艺术才能和选择题材的广阔。他的山水画特别出色，有时采用中国宋代画家马远、夏珪的一些手法，大胆地皴擦捶擢，有时也用一些明代画家李在等的破墨画法，别具风格。画集里选印的雪舟的代表作“山水长卷”、“四季山水”和“秋冬山水”等，从章法和透视上充分发挥了风景画的特点，无论是深山幽谷、美丽江河，都表现得既有气魄又富情致。画集中有两幅山水画是北京古老的艺术品作坊——荣宝斋新记印制的木刻彩印的。
