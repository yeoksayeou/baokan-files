    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：纽约长岛威斯特堡7月4日发生的一件轰动美国的婴孩绑票案已经在上星期破案。被绑的婴孩早已死亡。绑票的人叫安杰洛·拉马加，是一个非常需要钱来维持整个家庭生活而又找不到固定职业的美国工人。
    8月24日“纽约邮报”在“付钱……付钱……‘他非弄点钱不可’”的标题下报道这个美国社会的悲剧说：“事情今天看来是这样的：自己也是一个父亲的安杰洛·拉马加由于负债累累，无法担负，竟然铤而走险，为了弄钱不惜进行最后的疯狂的努力，绑架了温伯格家的婴儿，索取赎金。
    “他们中间谁也没有梦想到，他们所认识的这个勤劳的人，情愿天天连续每天工作十八个钟头来尽量赚钱养家的一个人，竟然堕落到绑架婴儿的地步。……”
