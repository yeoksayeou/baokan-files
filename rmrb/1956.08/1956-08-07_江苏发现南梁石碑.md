    Jiangsu Discovers Southern Liang Stone Stele
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee unearthed a Southern Liang stone stele, which had been lost for nearly a thousand years, at the site of the tomb of Xiao Xiu, the Prince Ancheng Kang of the Southern Liang Dynasty (located within the compound of Gan Jiaxiang Elementary School in Qixia District, Nanjing). This stone stele is one of the tomb steles of Xiao Xiu, and it was found split into four pieces.
    Xiao Xiu was the younger brother of Emperor Wu of Liang, Xiao Yan, and died in the 17th year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty (518 AD). There were originally four stone steles in front of his tomb, each engraved with articles written by contemporary literati Wang Sengru, Lu Chui, Liu Kaochuo, and Pei Ziye, describing his life. It is said that the original intention was to choose one of the articles to be engraved on a stele, but because all four articles were well-written, all four steles were engraved simultaneously. Later, according to the "Classified Compilation of Events of the Six Dynasties," only two steles remained in the Shaoxing era of the Southern Song Dynasty (1131 AD), and the other two only had the base left.
    Currently, the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committees are planning to conduct a comprehensive excavation to continue searching for the lost steles and spirit path stone pillars.

    江苏发现南梁石碑
    本报讯　最近，江苏省文物保管委员会和南京市文物保管委员会，在原南梁安成康王萧秀成墓址（现南京市栖霞区甘家巷小学院内），掘出了一块遗失将近千年的南梁石碑。这块石碑是萧秀成的墓碑之一，掘出时已分裂为四块。
    萧秀成是梁武帝萧衍之弟，死于梁天监十七年（公元518年）。在他墓前原有四座石碑，分别刻着当代文学家王僧孺、陆倕、刘考绰和裴子野为他撰写的记述生平的文章，据说当时原想选出一篇刻到碑上去，但因为四篇文章写得都好，所以，就同时刻了四块碑。后据“六朝事迹编类”所记，在南宋绍兴年间（公元1131年）就只剩下两座，其余两座只剩了下面的碑座。
    现在，江苏省和南京市文物保管委员会正在设计进行全面发掘，继续寻找失去的石碑和神道石柱。
