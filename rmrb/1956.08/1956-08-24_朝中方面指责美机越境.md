Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 23rd: At the Secretary-Generals' meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held today, the Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that, during the period from the beginning of August to August 21, U.S. military aircraft had illegally intruded into the airspace over the military control area of the Korean and Chinese side five times in violation of the Armistice Agreement. He demanded that the U.S. side take effective measures to ensure that such incidents do not occur again.

Of these five incidents, one occurred on August 2nd, when a U.S. military propeller-driven aircraft crossed the Military Demarcation Line from the airspace above Cheorwon, intruded into the airspace above Majang-ri on the Korean and Chinese side, and then changed direction and flew back to the U.S. side from the airspace above Jiap-ri.

    朝中方面指责美机越境
    新华社平壤23日电　在今天举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长指出，在从八月初到八月二十一日为止的期间内，美方军用飞机曾经五次违反停战协定非法侵入朝中方面军事控制地区上空。他要求美方采取有效措施，保证此类事件不再发生。
    在这五次事件中，有一次是在八月二日，美方军用螺旋桨式飞机一架从铁原上空越过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面的马场里上空，然后又变换方向从地甲里上空飞回美方地区。
