Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th: The new school year of 1956-1957 will begin in Soviet schools at all levels on September 1st.

This year, Soviet secondary and higher education institutions will make some major reforms in teaching. According to the resolution of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, general secondary schools will continue to strengthen comprehensive technical education and eliminate the phenomenon of separation between teaching and life to a certain extent.

According to newspaper reports, the Russian Federation has formulated a new teaching plan for general secondary schools. This teaching plan will be implemented in five hundred schools starting from September 1st this year. It is reported that the characteristic of the new plan is to further strengthen students' education in production theory and labor. For example, in grades 8 to 10, the practical training course will be cancelled and a new course, "Fundamentals of Production," will be offered. The teaching time for the new course will be twice that of the past practical training course. The time for manual labor courses in grades 3 and 4 and practical training in grades 5 and 6 will be greatly increased, and the teaching time for history, geography, physics, and other courses will be correspondingly reduced. The new plan takes into account the characteristics of comprehensive technical education in different regions. In cities, the "Fundamentals of Production" course is linked to industrial problems, while in agricultural areas, it is linked to agricultural problems.

The Soviet Union has published 104 kinds of textbooks for the new school year, with a total of 138 million copies. The textbooks for general middle schools have been simplified in content, the language is more popular, and they are more suitable for comprehensive technical education. In addition, the instruments and equipment for school experiments have been greatly increased. The income obtained by secondary vocational schools in production internships will no longer be turned over to the state but will be used to strengthen the material basis of the schools.

In the new school year, Soviet institutions of higher education will strengthen scientific research. Specialized scientific research laboratories will be established in some major schools to study individual important issues in science and the national economy. From the new school year, all institutions of higher education will offer three independent social science courses: History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, political economy, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism. The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education has formulated new teaching syllabuses for these courses in accordance with the spirit of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

With the arrival of the new school year, the Soviet Union will begin to implement a new system for granting scholarships to students in universities and secondary vocational schools. According to the new system, if students have financial difficulties and need state assistance, they can get scholarships, but their grades should be at least three. In the past, only students with grades of four and five could get scholarships.

    苏联的新学年开始了
    普通中学加强技术综合教育
    高等学校加强科学研究工作
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联各级学校9月1日就要开始1956—1957年新学年了。
    今年苏联的中等和高等学校在教学工作上都要作一些重大改革。普通中等学校将根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，继续加强综合技术教育，消除一定程度上的教学和生活脱节的现象。
    据报纸消息说，俄罗斯联邦已经制定了新的普通中等学校的教学计划。这个教学计划从今年9月1日起在五百个学校里实行。据悉，新计划的特点是进一步加强对学生的生产理论和劳动的教育。例如，在8到10年级取消实习课而开设一门新课“生产基础”。新课的讲授时数等于过去实习课的两倍。3、4年级手工劳动课程和5、6年级实习的时数将要大大增加，历史、地理、物理等课程的教学时数将相应减少。新计划照顾到了在不同地区进行综合技术教育的特点，在城市中“生产基础”课同工业问题联系，而在农业地区则同农业问题联系。
    苏联已经为新的学年出版了一百零四种教科书，共一亿三千八百万册。供普通中学用的教科书在内容上精简了一些，文字比较通俗，更适合于进行综合技术教育之用。除此以外，学校作实验用的仪器和设备大大增加。中等专业学校在生产实习中获得的收入不再交给国家，而用来加强学校的物质基础。
    在新的学年中，苏联各高等学校将加强科学研究工作。在一些主要的学校里将建立专门的科学研究实验室，研究科学和国民经济中的个别重要问题。所有高等学校从新学年起将开设三门独立的社会科学课程：苏共党史、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。苏联高等教育部已经按照苏共第二十次代表大会决议的精神制定了这些课程的新的教学大纲。
    在新学年到来的时候，苏联将开始实行新的颁发大学和中等专业学校学生助学金的制度。按照新制度，如果学生经济困难而需要国家帮助，就可以得到助学金，但是学生的成绩至少应该是三分。而在过去，只有得四分和五分的学生才能够得到助学金。
