    Rescind the Order Protecting Backwardness
    All the printed materials needed by the various units under the Jinan Railway Bureau are entrusted to the printing factory of the General Affairs Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau. Just look at what kind of things this printing factory is doing:
    Quality: We planned to use kraft paper to print archive bags, but they were printed with soft paper. Eight or nine out of every hundred were broken and could not be used at all. The paper inside the printed work logs is more than one centimeter larger than the cover. When we raised objections to them, the reply we received was: "Just make do with it."
    Price: Our original printed materials were all printed by the Xuzhou Local State-Owned Printing Factory. Each ordinary envelope cost eight fen, and each letter of introduction cost five jiao. The envelopes printed by the printing factory of the General Affairs Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau cost two fen and three li each, three times more expensive, and the quality of the paper was also worse. Each letter of introduction costs seven jiao and one fen, which is also much more expensive. Just as we were about to raise objections, an invoice stamped with "Payment due within three days, overdue penalty" was sent. There is no doubt that the price cannot be reduced.
    Delivery Time: According to regulations, delivery should be made at the end of the month or quarter, but even with repeated urging, they always deliver it late; if we don't urge them, it will be even more delayed. Once, our printed letters of introduction could not be printed in time, and the comrades on business trips could not leave.
    Readers may wonder: The printing factory of the General Affairs Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau is doing such a bad job, why is its attitude so arrogant? Readers may say: You deserve it, why don't you find a better printing factory to print your materials?
    There is a story behind this! The story is that on October 8, 1955, the Jinan Railway Bureau issued an order stating that "the printing materials needed by all subordinate units should be entrusted to the railway printing factory for printing, and no printing materials should be entrusted to printing factories outside the railway system without authorization, otherwise, they will not be reimbursed." It is this order that has become a protective talisman for protecting backwardness, restricting us from entrusting printing materials to printing factories that are cheap and of good quality, which makes us extremely distressed.
    We demand that this unreasonable restriction be lifted, and that administrative orders not be used to protect the lack of enthusiasm to improve work and irresponsible work attitude of the printing factory of the General Affairs Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau.

    取消保护落后的命令
    济南铁路管理局所属各个单位需要的印刷品，都是委托济南铁路管理局总务处印刷厂承印的。请看这个印刷厂尽做些什么样的事情：
    质量方面：我们计划用牛皮纸印档案袋，却给印成软纸的，每一百个中还有八、九个破的，根本不能用。印的工作日志，里面的纸竟比皮面大一公分多。向他们提意见，得到的答复是：“凑合着用吧”。
    价格方面：我们原来的印刷品都是徐州地方国营印刷厂承印的，每个普通信封是八厘，每本介绍信是五角。济南铁路管理局总务处印刷厂印的信封每个是二分三厘，贵了三倍，纸的质量还差。每本介绍信要七角一分，也贵多了。正想提意见时，盖着“限三日内交款、过期照罚”的章子的发票送来了。毫无疑问，价钱是不能减的了。
    交货期限方面：按规定都是月底、季终交货，但即便是三番五次地催促，他们总要过期才能送到；如果不去催他们，更要耽误事。有一次我们印的介绍信没有能及时印出，出差的同志都出不去了。
    读者们也许会奇怪：济南铁路管理局总务处印刷厂工作这样糟，为什么态度反而如此专横呢？读者们也许会说：你们自己也是活该，为什么不另外找个好一点的印刷厂承印呢？
    这背后有文章呵！文章就是1955年10月8日，济南铁路管理局下过一道命令，命令所属各单位“所需印刷品均应向铁路印刷厂托印，不得自找路外印刷厂托印，否则不准核销”。就是这道命令，成了保护落后的护身符，限制了我们不能到价廉物美的印刷厂去托印印刷品，使我们万分苦恼。
    我们要求取消这种不合理的限制，不要用行政命令去保护济南铁路管理局总务处印刷厂这种不积极改进工作和不负责任的工作态度。
