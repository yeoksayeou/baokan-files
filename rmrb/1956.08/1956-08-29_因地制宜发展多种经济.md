Editor's Note: The two articles published here are worthy of our attention. The famous "Huai Medicine" from Wen County and the popular "Qinghua Bamboo Goods" have experienced serious production declines due to the subjective and one-sided thinking of the local leadership (as well as other factors, of course). This has not only harmed the economic lives of local farmers but has also directly affected the needs of the state and the people. The losses caused by this kind of one-sided thinking, which emphasizes grain and cotton production while neglecting diversified operations, are not limited to these two counties. The reduction in production is not limited to these medicinal materials and bamboo goods either. It is hoped that areas with similar problems will conduct a comprehensive review of the problems in the leadership of production in their regions, taking into account the development of various local economies.

Why Has the Production of "Qinghua Bamboo Goods" Decreased?
By Our Correspondent Wang Changlong

　　For generations, the people of Xuliang Town in Bo'ai County, Henan Province, have relied on managing bamboo gardens and weaving bamboo goods as their main source of income. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the town can weave bamboo goods, producing more than sixty varieties of products, including bamboo tables, bamboo chairs, bamboo beds, bamboo baskets, bamboo sieves, and bamboo curtains. These products are collectively known as "Qinghua Bamboo Goods" and are sold throughout Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces. People's economic lives are quite comfortable, and there is a saying: "As long as the bamboo knife is working, there is no fear of rising grain prices."

　　Xuliang Town has 923 households with more than 3,500 people, with more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land, averaging more than six fen per person, and more than 1,005 mu of bamboo gardens, averaging more than two fen and eight li per person. This is clearly a rural area with a large population and little land. In January of this year, the Xuliang Collective Farm was established. The farm's management committee, based on past production, specifically calculated the income from agricultural and sideline production: the income from managing bamboo gardens and weaving bamboo goods accounted for 73.4% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations; while the income from agricultural production only accounted for 26.6% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. Thus, the Xuliang Collective Farm should have started from reality, first managing the bamboo gardens and weaving bamboo goods well, and then planning to allocate a certain amount of labor to do a good job in agricultural production. This would have been the correct approach to suit the local conditions. However, the Xuliang Collective Farm did not arrange production in this way. Like other grain-producing areas with more land, it focused on agricultural production and placed the production of handicrafts, which accounted for the main income of the farm members, in a secondary position. This practice, which violated the demands of the farm members and the local conditions, inevitably affected the increase in the income of the farm members.

　　The Xuliang Collective Farm has three directors and four deputy directors. Six directors and deputy directors are responsible for leading agricultural production, while only one deputy director is responsible for leading bamboo goods production. In fact, even this one deputy director is sometimes pulled away to engage in agricultural production. In this way, the directors' efforts are concentrated on agricultural production, and the production of bamboo goods is naturally neglected. The calculation of labor is also unreasonable, with the daily remuneration for agricultural production being too high and the remuneration for weaving bamboo goods being too low. For example, the farm stipulates that one labor day is worth 20 work points. A full laborer doing farm work can generally earn 20 work points a day, but a full laborer weaving bamboo goods, with the exception of a few skilled and fast people, cannot reach this number. As a result, the farm members are willing to do agricultural work but unwilling to weave bamboo goods. During the summer harvest and planting season, the farm also stipulated that a cash advance of 3 jiao could be given for earning one labor day doing farm work, while only 2 jiao could be given for earning one labor day weaving bamboo goods. This further dampened the enthusiasm of the farm members for weaving bamboo goods. Precisely because of this, the transaction volume of bamboo goods produced by the Xuliang Collective Farm from its establishment in January to the end of July was only more than 100,000 yuan, a decrease of more than three-quarters compared to the same period last year.

　　With such a large reduction in the production of bamboo goods, the income of the farm members naturally decreased accordingly. In addition, agricultural production required more investment than in the past, so the farm members generally complained that they "had no money to spend." Some farm members asked the cadres for money, but the cadres could only stare blankly and do nothing. Farm member Dou Dewen has very high skills in weaving bamboo baskets. In the past, he had more than 3.7 mu of his own bamboo garden. He processed and weaved his own bamboo poles to sell bamboo baskets, and he always had plenty of pocket money. In January of this year, his more than 3.7 mu of bamboo garden was valued at 400 yuan and put into the farm. The payment was deposited in the farm and could not be used casually. Although some labor work points earned from weaving bamboo goods were also advanced, the amount was very limited, which made Dou Dewen feel very financially difficult. In late July, Dou Dewen's son got married and needed money. He went to the farm cadres to borrow 30 yuan. The farm cadres also felt that it should be lent, but the farm had no money to lend. Finally, they managed to borrow 5 yuan. Farm member Li Deyi had 130 yuan deposited in the farm. He was eager to spend money and said to anyone he met: "If anyone gives me 30 yuan, I will give them my 130 yuan deposit in the farm."

　　During the summer wheat distribution, the farm did not implement the policy of more pay for more work, but distributed it equally according to the population, which made the farm members very dissatisfied. During the summer harvest and planting season, there was a lot of farm work and bamboo weaving work in their own farm, but more than 80 farm members went to work and earn wages at the state-owned farm five or six li away, causing losses to the farm's production. Some farm members were unwilling to weave bamboo goods collectively in the farm and sold them individually. Farm members Zhang Jinming and Zhang Fengsheng can weave a kind of sieve for drying medicine, which requires very fine bamboo weaving skills. Only three people in the whole farm can weave it. Because the work points stipulated by the farm were unreasonable, and the labor days earned could not be reasonably divided in time, the two of them had been weaving their own products for a long time. One person can weave one a day and earn two yuan. They can sell it at any time and get cash immediately. How could they be willing to participate in the collective work in the farm? In the spring, more than 1,600 farm members collectively wove bamboo goods, but by the beginning of August, only about 300 farm members persisted in collective production. This affected the fulfillment of the contract signed between the farm and the county supply and marketing cooperative's bamboo goods promotion station. As of August 7, the farm had not delivered any of the nine varieties of goods except for the flood prevention bamboo ropes that had been completed.

　　Why did the Xuliang Collective Farm fail to organize production in accordance with the actual situation and local conditions? This cannot be blamed solely on the leaders of the farm. Li Yongchang, Deputy Secretary of the Bo'ai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "The failure of the Xuliang Collective Farm to organize production in accordance with local conditions is inseparable from the county committee's generalized leadership and the guiding ideology of one-sidedly emphasizing agricultural production and neglecting diversified operations." The farm directors of the Xuliang Farm also had ideological resistance to this method of arranging production that put the cart before the horse. They said: The county committee's guidance on agricultural production is very specific, but in terms of diversified operations and sideline production, whether in written instructions or in meetings, only the sentence "areas with sideline occupations and handicrafts should strengthen leadership" is added at the end. But there is no specific content and requirements on how to strengthen leadership. The cadres from the county only ask for reports on the situation and materials, but do not help solve specific problems. The Bo'ai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly knew that among the 100 agricultural production cooperatives in the county, 23 cooperatives had bamboo gardens, and the income from bamboo goods production in 18 cooperatives accounted for more than 60% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations, but this bias has not been corrected. Now is the time to solve the problem.

Quickly Restore the Production of "Huai Medicine"
Li Shulin Zhang Xincan

　　The Chinese yam and rehmannia produced in Wen County, Henan Province, are commonly known as "Huai Medicine" (Wen County belonged to Huaiqing Prefecture in the past, so the medicinal materials produced are called Huai Medicine), which is famous at home and abroad and is an important variety in medicine. The characteristics of Wen County rehmannia are: thin skin, high oil content, and chrysanthemum heart; the characteristics of Chinese yam are: firm texture, thin slices, and white color. According to a survey, before the Anti-Japanese War, the county planted about 80,000 mu of Chinese yam and rehmannia every year (accounting for one-sixth of the county's total cultivated land), with an annual output of 10 million jin of Chinese yam and 16 million jin of rehmannia. Calculated at current prices, this is equivalent to more than 9 million yuan, which accounts for almost half of the county's agricultural production income. The farmers in Wen County not only have the technology to grow Chinese yam and rehmannia, but also can process Chinese yam and rehmannia into finished products. Therefore, in the past, merchants purchasing medicinal materials came to Wen County in an endless stream.

　　Old members of the Mengcun Agricultural Production Cooperative said that their village had 860 households. In the past, the whole village planted 600 mu of rehmannia every year, averaging 7 fen per household. Calculated at 500 jin per mu, the annual output was 300,000 jin. At the current price of 3 jiao and 5 fen per jin, the income from planting rehmannia alone would be more than 100,000 yuan, which would be equal to the total output value of the 5,000 mu of wheat planted by the cooperative this year. Chao Xiusong, a farmer in Chaozhao Village, planted 1.1 mu of Chinese yam one year before the Anti-Japanese War and sold it for 130 yuan; while the 13 mu of wheat he planted that year had a good harvest, but only yielded 10 shi of wheat, with a total value of less than 100 yuan. This shows that in the past, the farmers in Wen County relied on planting these special products to increase their income. Not only that, but the land that has been planted with Chinese yam and rehmannia can grow good crops for several years in a row. Therefore, it is also very beneficial in adjusting stubble and cultivating land fertility. In addition, there are income from by-products such as yam beans (grown on the seedlings) and yam peels from planting Chinese yam, as well as income from the processing of Chinese yam and rehmannia. This is the main way for 70% of farmers in Wen County to increase their income over the years, and it is also the way for agricultural cooperatives in Wen County to develop diversified operations and increase the income of their members in the future.

　　However, since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the production of medicinal materials in Wen County, like other agricultural production, has suffered extremely serious destruction. The planting of rehmannia has decreased by 80%; although the planting of Chinese yam has not decreased much, it has all been eaten as a substitute food. After the liberation of Wen County in 1947, the people's government vigorously developed production and guided farmers to grow medicinal materials at reasonable purchase prices. By 1949, the county had restored the planting of Chinese yam and rehmannia to more than 29,000 mu, producing more than 2.4 million jin of Chinese yam and more than 3 million jin of rehmannia, which greatly stimulated the rural economy. However, after 1950, the number of mu planted with medicinal materials gradually decreased. By 1955, the county only planted more than 7,100 mu of Chinese yam and rehmannia, accounting for slightly more than 24% of the planting area in 1949, and less than 10% compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. According to the statistics of the Wen County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's special product purchasing group, in 1955, the county purchased 1.5 million jin of Chinese yam and more than 170,000 jin of rehmannia, totaling more than 670,000 yuan, which is about one-third of the total value of 2.05 million yuan of special products sold in the county in 1949. This has greatly reduced the income of the farmers in Wen County and caused economic stagnation.

　　Why has the production of medicinal materials in Wen County decreased? The main reason is that the Wen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wen County People's Committee have a mindset of emphasizing grain and cotton and neglecting special products when guiding farmers' production, saying that farmers who plant special products are taking the capitalist road, and fertilizer is not supplied to farmers who grow special products. This has caused farmers to have misconceptions such as it is shameful to grow special products and it is not easy to buy grain if you grow special products. In addition, the low purchase prices have seriously dampened farmers' enthusiasm for managing special products. In 1949, state-owned companies purchased Chinese yam at an average price of 40 yuan per 100 jin; rehmannia at an average price of 20 yuan per 100 jin. However, at that time, private merchants purchased rehmannia at 140 yuan per 100 jin and Chinese yam at 70 yuan per 100 jin. Farmers' planting of medicinal materials was not enough to cover the cost. Many households ate Chinese yam as a substitute food and burned rehmannia as firewood. This was a great loss to the production of farmers in Wen County.

　　This spring, after the Central Committee issued the instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, the Wen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wen County People's Committee began to pay attention to the diversified operations of agricultural production cooperatives and to restore the production of Chinese yam and rehmannia. The bank loaned 8.1 million yuan, the supply and marketing cooperative paid more than 60,000 yuan in advance payments, and supplied 560,000 jin of cake fertilizer to meet the needs of farmers to grow Chinese yam and rehmannia. However, these measures are of no help this year. Because the "seedlings" for planting Chinese yam and rehmannia must be cultivated in the previous year before they can be planted in the second year, the county will only plant about 8,000 mu of Chinese yam and rehmannia this year, and the plan to plant 23,000 mu has not been completed. The Wen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should learn from past lessons and lead the agricultural production cooperatives to prepare for planting Chinese yam and rehmannia next year as soon as possible. The departments that purchase medicinal materials should purchase them at reasonable prices in order to guide agricultural production cooperatives to restore and develop the production of Huai medicine, increase farmers' income, and stimulate the rural economy.

    因地制宜发展多种经济
    编者按　这里发表的两篇文章，很值得我们注意。驰名中外的温县“怀药”和畅销各地的“清化竹货”，在当地领导上主观、片面的思想作风影响下（当然还有其他一些原因），严重减产了。这不仅使当地农民的经济生活受到损失，并且直接影响到国家和人民的需要。这种单纯强调粮棉生产、忽视多种经营的片面思想所造成的损失，何止这两个县？减产的又何止这些药材和竹货？希望存在类似问题的地区，结合当地各种经济发展状况，对自己地区生产领导上的问题，也作一全面的检查。
    “清化竹货”为什么减少了
    本报记者　王昌隆
    河南省博爱县许良镇的人们，历年来就是以经营竹园和编制竹货为主要收入。全镇所有男女全半劳力都会编制竹货，生产的主要品种有竹桌、竹椅、竹床、竹篮、竹筛、竹帘等六十多种，这些产品统称“清化竹货”，畅销于河南、山西、河北、山东等省，人们经济生活是很宽裕的，相传有“只要竹刀响，不怕粮价涨”的说法。
    许良镇有九百二十三户人家三千五百多口人，有耕地二千多亩，平均每人合六分多；有竹园一千零五亩，平均每人合二分八厘多。这显然是一个人多地少的农村。今年一月，许良镇成立了集体农庄，庄务管理委员会曾根据历年来生产情况，具体计算过农副业生产收入：全庄经营竹园和编制竹货生产收入，占农、副业总收入的73.4％；而农业生产收入，仅占农副业总收入的26.6％。这样，许良集体农庄本应该从实际出发，首先经营好竹园和编制竹货的生产，再规划出一定劳力搞好农业生产，这才是适合当地情况的正确作法。但是许良集体农庄不是这样安排生产，它和其它土地较多的产粮区一样，以经营农业生产为主，把占庄员生活主要收入的手工艺编制竹货生产，放在次要地位。这种违背庄员要求、违反当地条件的做法，势必影响庄员收入的增加。
    许良集体农庄有三个主任，有四个副主任，分工领导农业生产的有正副主任六人，领导竹货生产的只有一个副主任，实际上就连这一个副主任有时也还被拉去搞农业生产。这样，主任的力量都集中在农业生产上，编制竹货的生产自然就被忽视了。劳动的计算也不合理，农业生产劳动日报酬偏高，编制竹货劳动报酬偏低。如庄里规定一个劳动日工分是二十分，做农活的一个全劳动力，一般一天都赚到二十个工分，但编制竹货生产的一个全劳动力，除个别技术熟练、手快的人能赚到二十个工分外，绝大多数人都达不到这个数字。这样，就使得庄员们愿做农业生产活，而不愿编制竹货。夏收夏种时，庄里还曾规定做农活赚到一个劳动日，可先支给现金三角；编制竹货赚到一个劳动日，只支给两角。这就更打击了庄员们编制竹货生产的积极性。正因为这样，许良集体农庄从1月份建庄到7月底止，竹货生产交易额仅有十万多元。比去年同时期要减少四分之三还多。
    竹货生产既减少了这样多，当然庄员们的收入也就随着减少了。加上农业生产比过去投资大，因此庄员们普遍反映“没钱花”。有些庄员找干部要钱，干部也大瞪两眼没办法。庄员窦德文编竹篓技术很高，过去自己有三亩七分多竹园，自己的竹竿，自己加工编制竹篓出卖，手里的零花钱向来是很宽裕的。今年1月他的三亩七分多竹园作价四百元入了庄，价款存在庄里不能随便用，编制竹货赚到的劳动工分虽也预支了一些，为数也很有限，这就使窦德文大感经济困难。7月下旬，窦德文儿子结婚需要花钱，他找到庄干部要借三十元钱，庄干部也觉得应借给，而庄里却没有钱借，最后东筹西措才借给他五元。庄员李德义，在庄里存有一百三十元钱，他急着花钱，见人就说：“谁给我三十元，我庄里存的一百三十元钱就顶给谁。
    夏季小麦分配，庄里没有贯彻执行多劳多得政策，而是按人口平均分配，庄员们很不满意。夏收夏种时，自己庄里的农活、编竹货活很多，但却有八十多个庄员自流地到五、六里外的国营农场干活挣工资去了，以致庄里生产遭受到损失。还有些庄员不愿在庄里集体编竹货，个人自编自卖。庄员张金鸣、张凤生会编一种晒药的筛子，这是编竹很细致的技术，全庄只有三个人会编。因庄里规定的工分不合理，挣到的劳动日又不能即时合理分红，他们两个长期是各自编各自的。一天一个人能编一个，能赚两元钱，自己卖随时可以卖出得现款，这样，他们怎能愿意参加庄里去集体搞呢？春季有一千六百多庄员集体编制竹货生产，到8月初就减少到只有三百来个庄员坚持集体生产了。这就影响到庄里和县供销社竹货推销栈签订的合同的实现。截至8月7日，庄里除了已完成防汛竹绳外，其余九种品种一件也没有交货。
    许良集体农庄为什么不从实际出发，因地制宜地组织生产呢？这不能光怪农庄的领导干部。中共博爱县委副书记李永昌说：“许良集体农庄没有因地制宜组织生产，是和县委的一般化领导，片面强调农业生产、忽视多种经营的指导思想分不开的”。许良农庄的庄主任们，对这种轻重倒置安排生产的办法，思想上也是有抵触的。他们说：县委指导农业生产上很具体，可是，在多种经营和副业生产上，不管书面指示也好，开会布置也好，只是在末尾加上一句“有副业、手工业的地区要加强领导”。但如何加强领导，就没有具体内容和要求了。县里来的干部只叫汇报情况、要材料，不帮助解决具体问题。中共博爱县委清楚地知道全县一百个农业生产合作社中，有二十三个社有竹园，有十八个社竹货生产收入占农副业总收入60％以上，但对于这种偏向，却一直没有纠正。现在，是解决问题的时候了。
    赶快恢复“怀药”生产
    李树林　张新灿
    河南省温县所产的山药、地黄，通称“怀药”（温县过去属怀庆府，故所产药材称怀药），驰名国内外，为医药中重要品种。温县地黄的特点是：皮细、油水大、菊花心；山药的特点是：质坚、刨片薄、色泽洁白。据调查，抗战前全县每年种山药、地黄面积在八万亩左右（占全县总耕地面积六分之一），年产山药一千万斤，地黄一千六百万斤。按现在价格计算，约合人民币九百万元以上，几乎占全县农业生产收入的一半。温县农民不仅有种植山药、地黄的技术，而且还能把山药、地黄加工制成成品，所以在过去的温县农村中，收购药材的客商络绎不绝。
    孟村农业生产合作社的老社员谈，他们村八百六十户，在过去，全村每年要种地黄六百亩，每户平均种七分。按每亩产五百斤计算，全年共产三十万斤。就以现在价格每斤三角五分钱计算，全村光种地黄的收入就有十万多元，这将等于该社今年种五千亩大小麦的产量总值。晁召村农民晁秀松，抗战前有一年种一亩一分山药，卖了一百三十元；而当年他种的十三亩小麦，收成很好，才收了十石小麦，总值还不到一百元。这说明温县农民在过去，是依靠种植这些特产来增加自己收入的。不仅如此，凡种植过山药、地黄的土地，都能连长几年好庄稼。因此在调剂茬口，培养地力上也有很大好处。另外，种山药还有山药豆（秧子上结的）、山药皮等副产品收入，以及山药、地黄加工工资的收入。这是过去多年来温县70％农户增加收入的主要门径，也是今后温县农业社发展多种经营增加社员收入的道路。
    但是，从抗日战争爆发以后，温县的药材生产和其它农业生产一样，遭到了极其严重的摧残和破坏。地黄种植减少80％；山药虽没大减少，但都作为代食品吃掉。1947年温县解放后，人民政府大力发展生产，并以合理的收购价格指导农民种植药材。1949年温县全县恢复种植山药、地黄已达二万九千多亩，产山药二百四十多万斤，地黄三百多万斤，这就大大活跃了农村经济。可是，1950年以后，种植药材亩数又日趋下降，到1955年全县种植山药、地黄只有七千一百多亩，占1949年种植面积的24％多一点，比起抗战前还占不到10％。据温县供销社特产收购小组统计，1955年度全县收购山药一百五十万斤，地黄十七万多斤，共折人民币六十七万多元，大约相当于1949年全县特产出售总值二百零五万的三分之一。这就使温县农民大大减少了收入，引起了经济生活上的死滞。
    温县的药材生产为什么会减少呢？主要是中共温县县委和温县人民委员会，在指导农民生产时有重视粮棉轻视特产的思想，说农民种植特产是走资本主义路线，有肥料也不供应给种特产的农民。这就使农民思想上产生了种特产耻辱、种特产不易买到粮食等错觉。再加上收购价格偏低，严重打击了农民经营特产的积极性。1949年国营公司收购山药每百斤平均价格四十元；地黄每百斤平均价格二十元。但当时私商收购地黄每百斤是一百四十元，山药每百斤七十元。到1951年国营公司收购山药每百斤价格降到二十元，地黄每百斤价格降到十一元。农民种植药材不够本，许多户把山药当代食品吃掉，把地黄当柴烧了。这是温县农民生产上莫大损失。
    今年春季中央颁发了勤俭办社指示后，中共温县县委和温县人民委员会，才开始注意了农业生产合作社的多种经营，注意了恢复山药、地黄的生产，并曾由银行贷款八百一十万元，供销社支付预定金六万多元，供应饼肥五十六万斤，以适应农民种植山药、地黄的需要。可是，这些措施今年已经无济于事。因为种植山药、地黄必须头年培育好“栽子”，第二年才能种植，所以全县今年只种植山药、地黄大约八千亩，没有完成种植二万三千亩的计划。中共温县县委应该接受过去的教训，及早领导农业生产合作社做好明年种植山药、地黄的准备工作。收购药材的部门，应该用合理价格来收购，以指导农业生产合作社恢复和发展怀药生产，增加农民收入，活跃农村经济。
