    Should Commune Members Have Private Plots?
    The Henan Daily has recently published a series of articles discussing whether members of agricultural production cooperatives should have "private plots." Participants in this discussion include leaders and members of agricultural production cooperatives. Some people say that commune members should be given "private plots," while others say "it's better not to have them." This discussion has not yet ended.
    Those who advocate not giving commune members "private plots" believe that "private plots" are the root of "selfishness and self-interest." Wu Yushan, the head of Yanzhuang First Cooperative in the Zhengzhou suburban area, said in an article: If commune members have "private plots," they will have divided loyalties, and the relationship between personal interests and collective interests will be more difficult to arrange. For example, the fertilizer accumulated by commune members is always used on "private plots" first, while grass and soil fertilizers are given to the cooperative. There is also a prominent conflict between the time commune members spend on the cooperative's labor and on "private plot" labor. For example, in the primary cooperative he used to lead, there was a commune member named Peng Xiuyi who grew some very good cucumbers. He couldn't eat them all, so he had to sell cucumbers every day, and he didn't have time to do work for the cooperative. Wu Yushan said: The more urgent the busy farming season, the harder it is to allocate labor. For example, last summer, after the rain, weeds grew rapidly. At the critical moment when weeding was urgently needed, only four out of the thirty-four households in the entire cooperative were weeding in the cooperative's fields. The rest were working in their "private plots." Commune members with serious selfish and self-interested thoughts even stole sweet potato seedlings from the cooperative to plant in their own fields.
    Wu Yushan also believes that the location of "private plots" is also a problem. If a piece of land is centrally allocated to commune members, they will argue with each other, with one saying "he planted too much of mine" and the other saying "he stole my vegetables." If the plots are located by the side of the village, the crops are easily pecked by chickens, dug by pigs, and eaten by calves. If the plots are far away, not only is it inconvenient to travel and cultivate, but it also results in small patches scattered everywhere, hindering the cooperative's rational division of farming areas.
    If "private plots" are not retained, what will commune members eat? Wu Yushan said that the cooperative can collectively open several vegetable gardens to grow vegetables to solve the problem of commune members eating vegetables. Kang Shilin, a member of the CCP Zhengzhou Suburban Qilihe Township Branch, who is located in the Qilihe Cooperative, decided to abolish "private plots" last June. In his article, Kang Shilin introduced their cooperative's solution to the problem of commune members eating vegetables: each production team, based on the size of its population, allocated a certain amount of land to open vegetable gardens, which were managed uniformly by the production team, with commune members who have experience in growing vegetables being specially responsible for planting. He said that everyone had no objections to this approach.
    Those who advocate giving commune members "private plots" have different views on the above opinions. Li Wenbin, a commune member of the Zhengzhou Suburban Liulin Agricultural Cooperative, represents this type of opinion in his article. He said that the members of their cooperative do not have "private plots," but he has never been able to understand it. He believes that the reasons given by the cooperative cadres for not giving commune members "private plots" are insufficient. For example, it is said that commune members will only use fertilizer on "private plots," but in reality, each commune member only has a few cents of "private plots," so how much fertilizer can they use? As long as commune members are diligent and accumulate more fertilizer, it will be enough. It is said that commune members will only take care of the work of "private plots" and will affect the cooperative's production, but he believes that this is last year's "almanac" and is not suitable for use this year. This year, the primary cooperatives have been transformed into advanced cooperatives, the land remuneration has been abolished, and the commune members' source of income mainly depends on the labor income in the cooperative. Who can not actively participate in the cooperative's production to earn more workdays? The production of "private plots" can be carried out using the gaps in the morning and evening when the cooperative is not producing. As for the problem that there are many households in the cooperative and "private plots" are difficult to allocate, he believes that it can be solved as long as commune members think of a solution together. For example, a piece of land can be left by the side of the village for everyone to plant, or a little can be allocated on the land originally belonging to the commune members. He believes that commune members have a demand for "private plots." Li Wenbin said: In previous years, he had three cents of vegetable land, and he couldn't finish eating the vegetables he grew. Since he no longer has vegetable land, it has been very inconvenient to eat vegetables.

    The Hebei Daily recently published an article by Wu Xuan, director of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xueliuying Township, Baoding City, which also discussed the issue of "private plots." He said that in the past, the cadres of their cooperative believed that there was a conflict between allocating vegetable plots for commune members to plant and the cooperative's production. Therefore, a public vegetable garden was established in the cooperative. For commune members with high awareness, the cooperative did not allocate vegetable plots to them because they did not actively request them; vegetable plots were allocated to commune members with low awareness. The facts of the past six months have proved that it is not beneficial to not allocate vegetable plots to some commune members. It has increased trouble for the cooperative: commune members do not have cash to buy vegetables and have to buy on credit. One person buys a few cucumbers, a few scallions, and a few pounds of eggplant a day... and a long account has to be kept. There are even more problems for the commune members: a large group of people crowd into the vegetable garden to buy vegetables in the morning. Those who go late cannot buy the vegetables they want to eat, so they cannot eat what they want. Some commune members who live far away from the vegetable garden are unwilling to go to buy vegetables every day, and the cooperative cannot deliver vegetables in time, so they often cannot eat vegetables. The money that commune members spend on buying vegetables sometimes amounts to more than ten yuan a month. If they had a little vegetable land of their own, it would not take much effort, and it would be convenient to eat vegetables. Now, even commune members with high awareness are also requesting that some vegetable plots be allocated to them next year for their own planting.

### 社员该不该有自留地

    社员该不该有自留地
    河南日报上最近连续发表了几篇文章，讨论农业生产合作社社员该不该有“自留地”的问题。参加这个讨论的有农业生产合作社的领导人员和社员。有的人说应该给社员“自留地”，有的人说“还是不留好”。这个讨论还没有结束。
    主张不给社员分“自留地”的人认为“自留地”是“自私自利”的根子。郑州市郊区燕庄一社社长吴玉山在文章中说：社员有了“自留地”就多了一条心，个人利益和集体利益的关系就更难安排了。如社员积的肥料，总是先拣细肥上在“自留地”里，草粪、土粪才给社里。在社员从事社里的劳动和“自留地”的劳动时间上，矛盾也很突出。比方，他原来领导的初级社里有个社员叫彭修义，自己种了些黄瓜，长的很好，吃不完，因此，就得天天卖黄瓜，没工夫做社里的活。吴玉山说：越是在最紧急的农忙季节，劳动力越不好调配。比方，去年夏季，雨后草苗争长，在急需赶紧锄草的关头，全社三十四户，在社里锄地的只有四人。其余的大都在“自留地”里干活。自私自利思想严重的社员，还偷剪社的红薯秧往自己地里栽。
    吴玉山还认为“自留地”留在哪里也是问题。集中留一片地分给社员，社员之间不是这个说“他多种我的了”，就是那个说“他偷我的菜了”；留在村边，种上的作物又容易遭鸡啄、猪刨、牛犊子吃；留远地，不光来往耕作不方便，还弄得遍地这一小块，那一小块，妨碍社里合理划分耕作区。
    不留“自留地”，社员吃菜怎么办呢？吴玉山说，社里可以集体开几个菜园种菜，解决社员吃菜问题。中共郑州郊区七里河乡支部委员康世林所在的七里河社，去年六月间就由干部决定取消了“自留地”。康世林在他写的文章上介绍了他们社解决社员吃菜问题的办法：各生产队根据本队人口多少，抽出一定数量的土地开辟菜园，由生产队统一经营，指定有种菜经验的社员专门负责种植。他说这样做大家也没意见。
    主张给社员分“自留地”的人，对上述意见有不同的看法。郑州郊区柳林农业社社员李文彬的文章，代表了这类意见。他说，他们的社社员没有“自留地”，可是他到现在一直想不通。他认为社干部不给社员“自留地”的那些理由是不充分的。比如，说社员积肥会只往“自留地”里上，实际上每户社员只有几分“自留地”，能上多少肥料呢？只要社员手勤一点，多积些肥料就够用了。说社员有了“自留地”只顾干“自留地”的活，会影响社里的生产，他认为这是去年的“皇历”，不适合今年用了。今年初级社转成高级社，取消了土地报酬，社员的生活来源主要依靠在社里的劳动所得，谁能不积极参加社的生产好多得些劳动日呢？“自留地”里的生产，利用早、晚社里生产的空隙时间就可以进行。至于说社里户数多，“自留地”不好分配的问题，他认为只要让社员大家想办法就可以解决。例如在村边留块地分给大家种，或者在原属社员的土地上划分一点都可以。他认为社员是有“自留地”的要求的。李文彬说：往年他有三分菜地，种的菜吃不完，自从没有菜地以后，吃菜很不方便。
         ×××
    河北日报最近发表了保定市薛刘营乡曙光农业社主任吴暄的一篇文章，也谈到“自留地”的问题。他说，过去他们社干部认为给社员分自种菜地和社里的生产有矛盾，因此，在社里建立了公共菜园。对于觉悟高的社员，因为他们不积极要求分配自种菜地，社里就不分给他们；觉悟低的社员，就分给他们。半年来的事实证明，部分社员不分给菜地并没有好处。对社里来说是增加了麻烦：社员没有现钱买菜，都得赊账。一个人一天买几根黄瓜，几根葱、几斤茄子……就得记一大篇账。对社员们来说问题就更多了：早晨菜园里挤一大堆人买菜，去得晚的人，自己想吃的菜买不到，就吃不上合心的菜；有些离菜园远的社员，不愿意天天去买菜，社里又不能及时送菜，就常常吃不上菜。社员们买菜的钱，有的一个月计算一下就是十多元。如果自己有点菜地，用不了多少工夫，吃菜还方便。现在，觉悟高的社员也要求明年能分一些自种菜地。
