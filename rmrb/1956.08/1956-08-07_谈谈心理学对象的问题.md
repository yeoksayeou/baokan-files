Marxist-Leninist philosophy has pointed out that human psychological phenomena are the highest product of matter, the function of a particularly complex material (the human brain). Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity provides a method for studying brain activity and reveals the basic laws of brain function. These have prepared the correct theoretical premises and a solid scientific foundation for psychological scientific research. However, because psychology is a relatively young science in the modern scientific system, due to the high complexity of psychological activities themselves, the lack of extensive and in-depth scientific research in psychology, and the insufficient connection with practice, the question of the object of psychology is still hotly debated in the psychological community. The first Soviet Psychology Conference in 1952 raised and discussed this issue. Later, through the second and third psychological conferences in 1953 and 1955, debates on this issue unfolded. At the same time, the Soviet journals "Problems of Philosophy" and "Soviet Education" successively published a series of related articles. The fourth issue of "Problems of Philosophy" in 1954 and the ninth issue of "Soviet Education" in 1955 each made "discussion summaries." (The Chinese translations of the relevant Soviet papers and the "summary" of "Problems of Philosophy" mentioned in this article are all found in "Several Problems of Psychological Science," published by Science Press; the Chinese translation of the "summary" of "Soviet Education" is found in "Psychological Translation Report," 1956, first issue.) The Chinese psychological community has been closely watching the development of the discussion on the object of psychology in the Soviet psychological community and has gained a lot of useful inspiration from it. At the first plenary meeting of representatives of all members of the Chinese Psychological Society in 1955, we systematically studied the relevant Soviet papers and conducted discussions. However, due to our insufficient extensive and in-depth scientific research in psychology, and even weaker connection with practice, we also feel theoretical difficulties and have divergent opinions on these issues. We believe that the solution to these problems must rely on further extensive and in-depth scientific research, strengthening the connection with practice, and correct philosophical generalization.

The discussion on the object of psychology in the Soviet academic community, especially the "discussion summaries" of the two journals "Problems of Philosophy" and "Soviet Education," has helped us clarify that the essence of this issue lies in the relationship between higher nervous activity and psychological activity. It has also helped us clarify some obviously erroneous viewpoints on this issue that violate Marxist-Leninist philosophy and Pavlov's theory. For example, some people believe that since psychological activity is a function of the brain, psychology can be merged with higher nervous activity physiology, which mainly studies brain activity; in this way, psychology loses its special research object, and therefore, as a separately existing psychological science, there is no basis for it. This view obviously mistakenly equates general higher nervous activity with human psychological activity, forgets the qualitative difference between human and animal higher nervous activity, and obliterates the important characteristics of human psychological activity. The "summary" of "Problems of Philosophy" calls this erroneous argument a nihilistic viewpoint of biologizing psychology. Another erroneous viewpoint is the nihilistic viewpoint of sociologizing psychology. It starts from the correct viewpoint of the social constraints of human psychological activity, but it tends to understand psychological activity by separating it from the function of the human brain, obliterating the natural essence of human beings, and imagining people as products of abstract social relations, thus believing that applying Pavlov's theory to understand human psychological activity seems hopeless. Still other erroneous arguments take the path of psychophysical parallelism when trying to distinguish the so-called physiological aspect of higher nervous activity from the psychological aspect. Some argue that the neural processes of higher nervous activity are the object of physiology, while the content or results of higher nervous activity are the object of psychology. Here, either psychological activity is excluded from brain reflexes, or psychological activity is regarded as a phenomenon that, although determined by nervous activity, has its own independence. No matter what form their argument takes, its dualistic essence is obvious. The "summary" of "Soviet Education" also criticized an erroneous argument that equated psychological activity with a material phenomenon like electromagnetic waves based solely on speculation. In short, the discussion on the object of psychology in the Soviet academic community has criticized some obviously erroneous viewpoints, which is of great significance. However, it has not yet actively solved the deeper differences of opinion in the debate based on scientific facts, so that the object of psychology can be basically clarified. Judging from the discussion of the relationship between higher nervous activity and psychological activity, most psychologists (including the "summary" of "Problems of Philosophy") have correctly recognized that human psychological activity is also human higher nervous activity; psychological activity is not only the result of the brain's reflective activity, but also includes the process of the brain's reflective activity. However, there are still theoretical difficulties in understanding this principle. For example, what is the relationship between human higher nervous activity physiology and psychology? Is all human higher nervous activity psychological activity? To clarify this issue, we first need to clarify whether there are different levels of development in the function of human higher nervous activity. For example, the brain's regulation of the functions of various internal organs is mainly at the level of physiological phenomena, which is certainly human higher nervous activity; however, how people carry out highly developed abstract generalization thinking, how people carry out creative thought and imagination, how artists carry out the shaping of artistic images, and how scientists carry out scientific abstraction and generalization are also manifestations of human higher nervous activity, but it is obviously a higher level of development of human higher nervous activity, which has entered the field of psychology. Although physiological activity is included in this kind of psychological activity, it is no longer simply physiological activity as generally understood, but shows an important new quality of higher nervous activity - the ability of highly abstract generalization. Similarly, the scientific interpretation of this kind of human higher nervous activity phenomenon cannot be accomplished by pure physiological research. Therefore, psychological activity is a phenomenon that only appears in human beings when higher nervous activity develops to the highest level, and it is the concrete embodiment of the unity of human natural essence and social essence. Psychology is the science that aims to reveal the laws of the occurrence and development of this phenomenon. In this regard, Pavlov's theory of two signal systems has opened up a correct path for us to conduct scientific research. However, today our scientific work in this area is only just beginning. Moreover, the theoretical difficulties we encounter in this area are mainly due to the lack of sufficient scientific basis in this area. Therefore, to scientifically solve the basic theoretical problem of the relationship between higher nervous activity and psychological activity, we must carry out the following three aspects of research.

(1) Conduct comparative research on the evolution of nerve function in various animals with different levels of development in their racial development process, especially those key issues that are most sufficient to explain the qualitative characteristics of nerve function development, such as directional reflexes, trace effects, analysis and synthesis capabilities, and the transformation of conditioned reflexes. Through the experimental study of these issues, we can not only grasp the scientific facts of the gradual emergence of new qualities in the development of animal nerve function, so as to generalize the laws of animal nerve function development, but also enrich our knowledge of the natural development history of human higher nervous activity, so that we have sufficient scientific basis when comparing human and animal higher nervous activity.

(2) Conduct developmental psychological research on infants from the initial stage of life to the acquisition of language ability to clarify how infants gradually develop the coordinated activity of the first and second signal systems, develop language, and generate advanced thinking under the influence of human society and education. This research can enable us to understand how infants' higher nervous activity gradually develops from its mainly physiological level to the psychological level, so as to correctly grasp the essence of human psychological activity and the laws of its occurrence.

(3) We must reveal the essence of human abstract thinking from the psychological research of language and thinking. Obviously, abstract thinking not only distinguishes humans from animals, but also is the basic premise of human creative activity. How did human higher nervous activity develop the new quality of highly abstract thinking in its individual development process? The answer to this question will enable us to develop human psychology based on the laws of psychological development. At the same time, we must also study how pathological phenomena of psychological activity occur in the human brain under the influence of various pathogenic factors, and under what conditions it restores its normal activity. This will enable us to further understand the relationship between the human brain and psychological activity.

When we correctly distinguish the qualitative differences between animal and human higher nervous activity, and we master the laws of the occurrence and development of human psychological activity, then we can scientifically solve the problem of the relationship between human higher nervous activity and human psychological activity. Here, people may ask again: Some of the above-mentioned psychological research has just begun, and some have not even started yet. Should we abandon the discussion on the object of psychology at present? We believe that it is also wrong. Any science must follow the principle of starting from scientific facts when conducting philosophical analysis and generalization in its theory. In order to fully clarify the relationship between psychological activity and higher nervous activity, today's scientific facts in psychology are still very insufficient, but there are already some. Based on the accumulated scientific facts, it is still possible and necessary to make corresponding correct conclusions in theory. Because the above-mentioned scientific research also needs this correct conclusion as a guide. As for those issues that cannot be concluded for the time being and the scientific facts that urgently need to be enriched, they can be summarized as the goals of our future scientific research. This is a pragmatic scientific attitude. The method of simply quoting sentence by sentence from "citation" to "citation," which is popular among some people in the psychological community at present, cannot solve the philosophical problems of science.

Correct philosophical analysis and generalization based on the existing facts of scientific research will promote the smoother and healthier development of a science. Here, improving our Marxist-Leninist philosophical level is of course the most fundamental key. At the same time, in view of the lessons learned from the discussion of the object of psychology in the Soviet academic community, we believe that the attitude towards classical works is also very important. Therefore, the following two points are particularly worthy of our attention.

(1) Marxist-Leninist reflection theory correctly points out the scientific path to understanding human psychological activity for us. However, we must consider that when the classical writers put forward these principles, they mainly focused on the relationship between the subject of reflection and the reflected external world, that is, they were put forward within the scope of epistemology. As a specific object of psychology, an independently existing science, namely human psychological activity, is obviously more complex, because it includes the external world as the dynamic source of human cognitive function, the entire reflection process of brain reflective activity, and the entire complex problem of human transforming the external world through the initiative of reflective activity. Just as Lenin pointed out, we cannot confuse the theory of a certain structure of matter with the category of epistemology ("Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," p. 121), we cannot simply apply the category of consciousness in epistemology as a synonym for the entire psychological activity. However, many relevant papers in the past often simplified the problem in this way, which caused a lot of ideological confusion. For example, some people say that psychology is the study of human consciousness, so it is very natural to arouse people's debate on the materiality of psychological activity. In fact, the category of consciousness in epistemology cannot be simply equated with psychological activity, the object of psychology. For example, thinking as a psychological concept cannot be understood and studied without its material coat - language. Therefore, many debates on materiality and non-materiality raised in the discussion of psychological activity are actually the result of ideological confusion. Therefore, how to understand the philosophical category of dialectical materialism and how to correctly use it to help us interpret scientific facts is what we must carefully study.

(2) Marxist-Leninist classical writers did not systematically write on psychology problems. They sometimes touched on it when discussing philosophical categories, and sometimes they used it as an example for analogy. We should also consider that the classical writers also had their own characteristics of the times when they put forward a certain point of view, especially the influence of the scientific development level at that time on their explanation of a certain point of view. Therefore, when we discuss the specific problems of a science today, we should understand its spiritual essence as the guiding principle of our thinking, and we cannot isolate and extract its isolated words and phrases regardless of the specific occasion or the essence of the problem and then draw conclusions. For example, in many relevant papers we have come into contact with, Lenin's argument in the article "What is 'The Friends of the People'?" is often quoted, pointing out that psychology should directly study the material entity of psychological phenomena, that is, the nerve process ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 1, p. 124). There is no doubt about the correct guiding significance of this argument for psychological research. However, some people oppose psychological phenomena to their material entity, and instead cite Lenin's argument as a defense for their obviously erroneous dualism of nerve-psychological theory. In the "summary" of "Problems of Philosophy," after quoting this argument, it goes on to say: "... Therefore, nerve processes and psychological phenomena cannot be confused with each other." Such a statement is at least very unclear. Now that Pavlov's theory has developed (in Lenin's time, Sechenov's theory of reflexes lacked scientific experimental research), we should understand Lenin's argument in conjunction with the scientific facts of the characteristics of human higher nervous activity. The higher nervous process of people who have developed to the psychological level is also the "nerve process" referred to by Lenin, which is also the object of psychological research.

In short, dogmatic treatment of classical works will hinder the smooth development of our scientific research. Especially in dealing with the highly complex issue of the relationship between higher nervous activity and psychological activity, if we do not specifically analyze the problem on the basis of scientific facts, but simply replace psychological concepts with epistemological philosophical categories, it will not solve the problem, and it will not be of any benefit to psychological scientific research. Widely carrying out scientific research and creatively carrying out philosophical analysis and generalization should be the correct way to solve the object of psychology, especially the relationship between psychological activity and higher nervous activity.

    谈谈心理学对象的问题
    丁瓒
    马克思列宁主义哲学曾经指出，人的心理的东西是物质的最高产物，是特别复杂的物质（人脑）的机能。巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动学说提供了研究大脑活动的方法，揭露了大脑工作的基本规律。这些都为心理学进行科学研究准备了正确的理论前提和坚实的科学基础。但是，由于心理学在现代科学体系中是一门较年轻的科学，由于心理活动本身的高度复杂性，对于心理学科学研究的不够广泛和深入，以及对于实践的联系还很不够，所以心理学的对象问题在心理学界还有热烈的争辩。1952年苏联第一次心理学会议上就提出并且讨论了这个问题。后来经过1953年和1955年的第二、第三两次心理学会议，就这个问题展开了争论。同时，苏联“哲学问题”和“苏维埃教育学”两个杂志先后发表了一系列有关论文。1954年第四期的“哲学问题”和1955年第九期的“苏维埃教育”又都分别作出了“讨论总结”。（本文提到的苏联有关论文和“哲学问题”杂志的“总结”中译文均见“心理科学的几个问题”，科学出版社出版；“苏维埃教育学”杂志的“总结”中译文见“心理学译报”1956年第一期。）中国心理学界一直注视着苏联心理学界关于心理学对象问题的讨论的发展，并且从中获得了不少有益的启发。在1955年中国心理学会第一次全体会员代表大会上，又系统地学习了苏联有关这方面的论文，并进行了讨论。但是，由于我们对心理学的科学研究更是不够广泛和深入，对实践的联系更是薄弱，我们在理论问题上也同样感到困难，存在着分歧的意见。对于这些问题的解决，我们认为必须依赖进一步广泛而深入地展开科学研究，加强对实践的联系，以及正确地进行哲学概括。
    苏联学术界关于心理学对象问题的讨论，特别是“哲学问题”和“苏维埃教育”两个杂志的“讨论总结”，帮助我们明确了这个问题的本质是在于高级神经活动同心理活动的关系问题。并且也帮助我们澄清了在这个问题上若干显然是违反了马克思列宁主义哲学和巴甫洛夫学说的错误观点。例如，有人认为心理活动既然是脑的机能，那末心理学就可以同主要是研究大脑活动的高级神经活动生理学合而为一；这样，心理学就失去了自己的特殊研究对象，因而作为一门单独存在的心理科学也就没有什么依据了。这种看法，显然是把一般的高级神经活动同人的心理活动错误地等同起来，忘记了人同动物的高级神经活动的质的区别，抹煞了人的心理活动的重要特点。“哲学问题”杂志“总结”就称这种错误论点为把心理学生物学化的取消派观点。另一种错误观点是把心理学社会学化的取消派观点，它是从人的心理活动的社会制约性这一正确的观点出发的，但是它倾向于脱离了人脑的机能来理解心理活动，抹煞了人的自然实质，把人设想成抽象的社会关系的产物，因而认为应用巴甫洛夫学说来理解人的心理活动似乎是没有什么希望的。再有一些错误的论点是在想区别高级神经活动的所谓生理方面同心理方面时走上心物平行论的歧途。有人这样论证：高级神经活动的神经过程是生理学的对象，而高级神经活动的内容或结果则是心理学的对象。在这里，或者把心理活动排除在大脑反射之外，或者把心理活动视为同神经活动虽有被决定的关系，但是具有本身的独立性的一种现象。无论他们的提法采取何种方式，其二元论的实质都是显然的。“苏维埃教育学”杂志的“总结”还批判了一种单凭臆想的把心理活动等同于像电磁波一样的一种物质现象的错误论点。总之，苏联学术界关于心理学对象问题的讨论，批判了某些显然是错误的观点，这是有着很大的意义的。但是，积极地根据科学事实解决争论中更深刻的意见分歧，使心理学对象问题能在基本上得到明确，还是没有做到。从高级神经活动同心理活动的关系问题的讨论情况看来，多数的心理学家（包括“哲学问题”杂志的“总结”）已经正确地认识到人的心理活动也就是人的高级神经活动；心理活动不仅是人脑反映活动的结果，同时也包括了人脑反映活动的过程。但是，对于这个原则的理解，还存在着理论上的困难。例如，人的高级神经活动生理学同心理学的关系是怎样的呢？是不是所有人的高级神经活动都是心理活动呢？如要弄清这个问题，那就首先需要弄清，人的高级神经活动在其机能上是不是还存在着不同的发展水平。举例来说，脑对于身体内部各种器官机能的调节作用主要是属于生理现象的水平，这固然是人的高级神经活动；但是，人怎样进行高度发展的抽象概括思惟，人怎样进行创造性的思想和想像，艺术家怎样进行艺术形象的塑造，科学家如何进行科学的抽象和概括，这同样也是人的高级神经活动的体现，但是显然是人的高级神经活动发展的更高水平，已经进入了心理学的领域。在这种心理活动中虽然包括着生理活动，但是已不单纯是一般所理解的生理活动，而是表现了高级神经活动的重要新质——高度抽象概括的能力。同样，对于人的这种高级神经活动现象的科学阐释就不是单纯的生理学研究所能济事的了。所以心理活动是只有在人身上才可以找到的高级神经活动发展到最高水平上所出现的现象，是人的自然实质同社会实质的统一的具体体现。心理学就是要揭露这种现象的发生和发展的规律的科学。在这方面，巴甫洛夫的两种信号系统学说为我们进行科学研究开辟了正确的途径。但是今天我们在这方面的科学工作还只是开始。并且，我们在这方面所遭遇到的理论上的困难，其主要原因也正在于这方面的科学依据不够。因此，我们要科学地解决高级神经活动同心理活动的关系这个基本理论问题，就必需展开以下三方面的研究。
    （1）对各种发展水平不同的动物在其种族发展过程中神经机能的演化进行比较研究，特别是那些最足以说明神经机能发展的质的特点的关键问题，如定向反射、痕迹作用、分析综合能力和条件反射的转化等问题。通过这些问题的实验研究，不仅可使我们掌握动物神经机能发展中新质逐渐产生的科学事实，从而概括出动物神经机能发展的规律，同时也就能够丰富我们对于人的高级神经活动的自然发展史的知识，使我们对于人同动物的高级神经活动进行比较时有足够的科学依据。
    （2）对婴儿从初生期到获得语言能力这一阶段进行发生心理学的研究，来阐明婴儿如何在人的社会影响和教养下逐渐发生了第一、第二两种信号系统的协同活动，发生了语言，产生了高级思维。这种研究可使我们认识婴儿的高级神经活动如何从其主要是生理的水平而逐步发展到心理水平，从而正确地掌握人的心理活动的本质及其发生的规律。
    （3）我们要从语言和思维的心理学研究来揭露人的抽象思维的本质。显然，抽象思维不仅使人区别于动物，并且是人的创造性活动的基本前提。人的高级神经活动如何在其个体发展过程中发展了高度抽象思维这个新质的？这个问题的解答将使我们有可能依据心理发展的规律来发展人的心理。同时，我们也要研究人脑在各种不同的致病因素影响下如何发生了心理活动的病理现象，又在什么条件下恢复它的正常活动。这就可使我们更深入一步地认识人脑同心理活动的关系。
    我们正确地区别了动物同人的高级神经活动的质的差异，我们掌握了人的心理活动发生和发展的规律，那末我们就可以科学地解决人的高级神经活动同人的心理活动的关系问题了。在这里，人们可能又要问：上述的心理学研究有些是刚刚开始，有些甚至还没有开始，我们是不是在目前就放弃心理学对象问题的讨论呢？我们认为那也是不对的。任何一门科学在其理论上进行哲学分析和概括的时候，必须从科学事实出发，这是必需遵守的原则。为了充分地明确心理活动同高级神经活动的关系问题，今天心理学的科学事实还非常不够，但是也已经有了一些。根据已经积累的科学事实，在理论上作出相应的正确结论还是可以的，并且是必要的。因为上面所说的科学研究还必需有这种正确的结论来作指导。至于那些暂时还不能遽下结论的问题和亟待充实的科学事实就可总结出来作为我们将来进行科学研究的目标，这就是实事求是的科学态度。像在目前心理学界某些人们中间所流行的那种从“引证”到“引证”的单纯寻章摘句的办法，是解决不了科学的哲学问题的。
    依据科学研究已有的事实进行正确的哲学分析和概括，将促进一门科学更顺利更健全的发展。在这里，提高我们的马克思列宁主义哲学水平，当然是最根本的关键所在。同时，有鉴于苏联学术界讨论心理学对象问题时的教训，我们认为用什么态度来对待经典著作的问题也很重要。因此，下述两点就特别值得我们注意。
    （1）马克思列宁主义反映论，为我们正确地指出理解人的心理活动的科学途径。但是我们必需考虑到经典作家们在提示这些原理时，主要是着重在于反映者主体同被反映的外间世界的关系上，也就是说是在认识论范围以内提出来的。而作为一门独立存在的科学——心理学的具体对象即人的心理活动，显然是更为复杂的，因为它包括了外间世界作为人的认识作用的动力来源、人脑反映活动的整个反射过程，以及人通过反映活动的能动性来改造外间世界等整个的复杂问题。正如列宁所指出的，我们不能把物质的某种构造的理论同认识论的范畴混为一谈（“唯物主义与经验批判主义”，第121页）一样，我们也就不能把认识论的意识范畴同整个心理活动简单地作为同义语来应用。但是，过去不少有关论文往往这样把问题简单化了，因而就引起不少思想上的混乱。例如，有人说心理学就是研究人的意识的，于是就很自然地会引起人们关于心理活动的物质性问题的争论。实际上，认识论的意识范畴同心理学对象的心理活动之间是不能简单地划一等号的。例如作为心理学概念的思维，就不能离开其物质外衣——语言来理解和研究。所以在讨论心理活动时提出物质性同非物质性的许多争论，其实都是思想混乱的结果。因此，如何理解辩证唯物主义哲学范畴，以及如何正确地运用它来帮助我们阐释科学事实，是我们必需慎重研究的。
    （2）马克思列宁主义经典作家们并没有系统地专论过心理学的问题，他们有时是在论证哲学范畴时涉及的，有时还是在用来作例证进行类比时涉及的。我们还应考虑到经典作家们提出某一论点时也有着他们的时代特点，特别是他们在说明某一论点时所受的当时科学发展水平的影响。所以我们今天在讨论一门科学的具体问题时，就应该体会其精神实质作为我们思想的指导原则，而不可以不管具体场合、不管问题实质而孤立地摘录其片言只语从而遽下论断。例如，在我们所接触到的不少有关论文中，常常引用列宁在“什么是‘人民之友’”一文中所提示的心理学应该径直研究心理现象的物质本体即神经过程的论点（“列宁全集”，第1册，第124页）。这个论点对于心理学研究的正确指导意义是毫无疑问的。但是，有人却把心理现象同其物质本体对立起来，反而引用列宁这个论点为其显然是错误的神经——心理论的二元论来作辩解。就在“哲学问题”的“总结”中，也在引用这个论点以后接着就说：“……因此，神经过程与心理现象是不能彼此混同的”。这样的提法至少是很不明确的。在巴甫洛夫学说发展了的现在（在列宁的时代，谢切诺夫的反射论还缺乏科学的实验研究），我们就应该把列宁这个论点结合到人的高级神经活动特点的科学事实来理解。在发展到心理水平的人的高级神经过程也就是列宁所指的“神经过程”，也就是心理学的研究对象了。
    总之，教条主义地对待经典著作，将妨碍我们科学研究的顺利开展。特别是在处理高级神经活动同心理活动的关系这样一个高度复杂的问题上，我们要是不在科学事实的基础上具体地分析问题，而只是简单地用认识论哲学范畴来替代心理学概念，那是不能解决问题的，对于心理学的科学研究也是不会有什么好处的。广泛地展开科学研究，创造性地进行哲学分析和概括，应该是解决心理学对象，特别是心理活动同高级神经活动的关系问题的正确途径。
