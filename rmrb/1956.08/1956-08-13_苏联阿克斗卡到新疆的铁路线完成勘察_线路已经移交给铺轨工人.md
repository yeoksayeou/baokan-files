Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 12th: Soviet survey personnel, having completed the survey work of the Soviet section of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway, have handed over the line to track-laying workers.

Along the route of this future railway, the surveyors have explored many resources conducive to railway construction. For example, according to the survey results, the future Zhalanashikul station, located near the middle of the Junggar Gate, will be able to obtain sufficient water because the surveyors discovered thick aquifers fifteen to twenty meters underground. Sufficient underground water sources have also been discovered at fifteen passing loops and two station locations on the future railway.

The work of investigating rock production areas in the area of Friendship Station has been completed. A fifty-meter-thick layer of granite suitable for decoration was discovered there. Sand and gravel production areas have been discovered near the village of Uqi-Alal.

    苏联阿克斗卡到新疆的铁路线完成勘察
    线路已经移交给铺轨工人
    新华社莫斯科12日电　完成了兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路苏联境内段的勘察任务的苏联勘察工作人员，已经把线路移交给铺轨工人。
    勘察工作者在这条未来铁路的沿线上已经勘察出了许多有助于铁路建设的资源。例如，根据勘察结果，位于准噶尔山口中间左近的未来的扎拉纳什库尔车站，将可以获得充足的用水，因为勘察者在那里从十五到二十公尺的地下深处发现了厚厚的含水层。在未来铁路的十五个会让站和两个车站地方，也发现地下有充足的水源。
    在友谊站地段调查岩石产地的工作已经结束。那里发现有适合装饰用的厚达五十公尺的花岗石层。在乌契—阿拉尔村附近已经发现有砂砾产地。
