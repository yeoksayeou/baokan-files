Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou. More than sixty kinds of tropical plants with economic value have been discovered in Fujian Province. These include several latex plants such as the India rubber tree and climbing rubber, tropical oil crops such as avocado, physic nut, stone chestnut, and the American pecan, which is valued by countries all over the world for its high nutritional value. There are also okra, wine palm, mangrove, gambier, star anise, bay laurel, betel nut, and kapok from Java, which are beverage, dye, spice, medicinal, and fiber plants, as well as sweet sapodilla, mango from Luzon, and pomelo from Siam.

Most of these tropical plants were introduced by overseas Chinese from their places of residence. Now they have taken root and grown in Fujian, blooming and bearing fruit, and have the prospect of being propagated in large quantities. A large number of climbing rubber plants have been found mixed in a tropical rainforest. The thick vines climb and wrap around tall trees or hang in the air. According to the analysis by teachers and students of the Biology Department of Xiamen University, the rubber content of this climbing rubber reaches 40%. The dried rubber sheets made from it have high elasticity and toughness, and can be used to manufacture advanced rubber products. Okra, which tastes no less than coffee, has been discovered in Xiamen, Longxi, and Yunxiao. It only needs to be sown in April each year, and it can reproduce in large quantities on its own without care, and it can be harvested in July.

The above-mentioned tropical plants with economic value were discovered by the Tropical Crop Investigation Group of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture during an investigation in southern Fujian. This investigation started on July 6th and ended on August 9th. Zhao Xiuqian, a professor in the Biology Department of Xiamen University, also participated in this investigation. At present, the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture is studying and formulating a plan for developing tropical crops in large quantities in Fujian in the future based on this investigation material and other materials, and has notified the agricultural departments of relevant counties and cities to pay attention to protecting these discovered tropical crops and collect a large number of seeds for future propagation.

    福建省发现六十多种热带植物
    据新华社福州电　福建省已经发现富有经济价值的热带植物六十多种。其中有印度橡胶树、藤本橡胶等多种胶乳植物，有鳄梨、麻风树、石栗和受到世界各国珍视的、营养价值很高的美洲山核桃等热带油料作物，有秋葵、酒椰子、红树、薯莨、八角、香叶树、槟榔和爪哇木棉等饮料、染料、香料、药用和纤维植物，还有甜美的人心果、吕宋芒果、暹逻蜜柚等热带水果。
    这些热带植物大部分是由福建华侨陆续从侨居地引种来的，现在都已在福建生根成长，开花结果，有大量繁殖的前途。已发现的大量混生在一片热带雨林中的藤本橡胶，粗大的藤条都攀附和缠绕在大乔木上或悬垂在空中。根据厦门大学生物系师生检验分析结果，这种藤本橡胶含胶量达40％，制成的干胶片弹性大、韧性强，可制造高级橡胶产品。在厦门、龙溪和云霄等地发现的味道不亚于咖啡的秋葵，每年只要在四月间播种，不加照料就能自行大量繁殖，到七月间就可收获。
    上述富有经济价值的热带植物，是福建省农业厅热带作物调查组从福建南部调查发现的。这次调查从7月6日开始到8月9日结束。厦门大学生物系教授赵修谦也参加了这次调查。现在，福建省农业厅正根据这次调查材料和其他材料，研究和拟定今后在福建大量发展热带作物的方案，并已通知有关县市农业部门要注意保护这些已发现的热带作物，大量采集种籽，以便今后繁殖。
