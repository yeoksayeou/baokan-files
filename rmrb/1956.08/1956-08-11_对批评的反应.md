    Reactions to Criticism
    Uncomfortable Sock Linings Have Been Discontinued
    A letter from the Beijing Local State-Owned Qinghe United Factory states: "The article 'Uncomfortable but Pretty Sock Linings' published in the People's Daily on May 24th criticized the poor quality of our factory's products. After our inspection, this criticism is correct. These sock linings were knitted by our factory last year using hand-operated knitting machines. Due to improper operation and uneven rocking force, some sock openings were too tight. However, we stopped knitting these socks in August of last year. We have now requested department stores to stop selling and accept returns, and the factory has re-examined the quality standards for semi-finished products to avoid similar situations from happening again."
    Leather Shoe Quality Being Improved
    A letter from Jiangsu Province First Prison states: "The People's Daily's criticism on May 29th that the leather shoes from the Nanjing Local State-Owned Xinsheng Shoe Factory were of poor quality and high price is correct. The factory has conducted an inspection, established a management system, designated specific personnel to be responsible for product quality inspection, and also established a technical quality research group. Substandard leather is now not allowed to enter the warehouse, and substandard leather shoes are not allowed to leave the factory. Scraps of leather that were not previously paid much attention to are now being utilized. Recently, the process of stitching the welt has also been improved, and work that originally took 69 minutes can now be done in only 32 minutes."
    "Unclaimed" Parcel Incident Resolved, Responsibility Established
    A letter from the Shandong Province Changle County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau states: "The article 'Unclaimed' published in the People's Daily on July 20th, criticizing our bureau for accumulating parcels and returning them to the origin as 'unclaimed,' is entirely true. This was an oversight in our work, and the responsibility has now been determined. The personnel responsible for the dereliction of duty will be punished."

    对批评的反应
    难穿的袜套已经停织
    北京市地方国营清河联合工厂来信说：五月二十四日人民日报发表“难穿的漂亮袜套”一文，批评我厂产品质量不好。经我们检查，这个批评是正确的。这种袜套是我厂去年用手摇袜机织的，因为操作不当，摇力不匀，有的袜口紧。不过，去年八月已不再织这种袜子。现在我们已请求百货公司停销退换，厂里又重新审查了半成品规格质量标准，避免再次发生类似情况。
    皮鞋质量正在改进
    江苏省第一监狱来信说：五月二十九日人民日报批评南京地方国营新生制鞋厂的皮鞋质量不好，价格高，是正确的。厂里已进行了检查，建立了管理制度，指定专人负责产品质量检查，还成立了技术质量研究小组，不合格的皮子已一律不进库，不合格的皮鞋已一律不出厂。过去不大注意的零碎皮子，现在也都加以利用。最近还改进了缝沿条的工序，原来用六十九分钟做的活，现在只用三十二分钟就可以了。
    “无人认领”包裹事已查清责任
    山东省昌乐县邮电局来信说：七月二十日人民日报发表“无人认领”一文，批评我局积压包裹，并按“无人认领”的情况退回原处一事，完全属实。这是我们工作中的疏忽，现在已经查清责任，有关失职人员将受到处分。
