    Negligence in Dushan County Hospital, Guizhou Province, Endangers Lives
    Editor:
    We are writing to report an incident to you: On June 21st, Li Wende, from the fourth production team of the Mawan Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, was herding a group of cattle up the mountain when he was suddenly attacked and severely injured by a tiger. After the masses learned of this, they immediately organized a tiger-hunting team and went to search and surround the mountain. After discovering the tiger's tracks, cooperative member Luo Dengming went forward with a gun to kill it, but the bullet did not fire, and he was pounced on and bitten by the tiger. Later, the tiger was killed by the masses. After the township sent the two farmers who were bitten by the tiger to the Dushan County Hospital, the person in charge of the hospital first demanded that they pay 30 yuan in medical expenses, and then demanded grain coupons and proof of identity. They explained that because the incident was unexpected, they were not prepared, and also because they did not understand the hospital's procedures, they requested to send them over tomorrow, and to be admitted and given medication today. However, the hospital's surgeon, Li Qifu, said: "This is the state's system, the hospital's rules. Without money, without grain coupons, without proof, you are not allowed to be hospitalized." Until late at night, the hospital still did not allow them to be admitted (the people sent by the township had already returned, unaware of this situation). These two seriously injured farmers, in a state of no care, hunger, cold, and excruciating pain, crawled and walked back to their homes, which were over ten kilometers away from the hospital. Their wounds had already become inflamed and festering, and they had no choice but to use local remedies and medicines for treatment.
    This incident has aroused widespread anger and dissatisfaction among the masses, who all say: The hospital is the people's hospital, why does it not care about people's lives? We request that the relevant departments promptly investigate and handle this incident of negligence that endangers lives.

### 贵州独山县卫生院玩忽人命

    贵州独山县卫生院玩忽人命编辑同志：
    我们向你反映一件事情：六月二十一日，麻万乡农业生产合作社第四生产队的李文德赶一群牛上山去放牧，途中突然遇见一只老虎把他扑倒，咬成了重伤。群众知道这个消息以后，立即组织了打虎队，前往搜山围捕。发现了虎踪以后，社员罗登明就提枪前往捕杀，可是子弹没有打响，他被虎扑倒咬伤。后来老虎被群众打死了。乡里把被虎咬伤的两人送到独山卫生院以后，卫生院的负责人首先要他们交三十元的医疗费，其次要交米票和证明。他们说因为事情出于意外，没有准备，而且因为不明白院里的手续规矩，要求明天再送上，今天暂时住下先敷药。但院里的外科医生黎启富却说：“这是国家的制度，院里的规矩，没钱，没米票，没证明就不准住院。”一直到了深夜，卫生院还是不让他们住下（乡里派来的人先回去了，不知这一情况）。这两个重伤农民，在无人护理和饥寒剧痛交迫的情况下，连爬带走地回到了距医院二十华里的家中。他们的伤口已经发炎溃澜，只好用土方土药治疗。
    这件事已引起广大群众的愤怒和不满，群众都说：医院是人民的医院，为什么不管人的死活？我们要求有关部门迅速调查处理这一玩忽人命的事情。
