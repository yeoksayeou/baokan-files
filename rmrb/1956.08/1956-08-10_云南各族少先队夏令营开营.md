    Yunnan Ethnic Minority Young Pioneers Summer Camp Opens

    (By our reporter) The Yunnan Province Young Pioneers Summer Camp opened in Kunming on the afternoon of August 1. A total of 324 children from various ethnic groups in Yunnan are participating in this summer camp, including 118 children from more than ten ethnic minorities such as Dai, Yi, and Zhuang. Some of these children come from the foothills of Gaoligong Mountain, some from the banks of the Jinsha River, and some from mines.... These outstanding representatives of the Young Pioneers from ten special districts and two cities will happily spend a colorful summer vacation in this family of nationalities. The vast majority of these children are in Kunming for the first time, and it is the first time that they have gathered together with so many fraternal ethnic friends, and everyone is very excited. The Dai child Dao Andi traveled so far for the first time, and she had a happy smile on her face when she talked about it; when someone asked the Yi child Peng Xiuying if she missed home here, she cocked her head and said, "I don't miss it at all, it's so good here!" Everywhere in the camp, you can see children in twos and threes wearing different ethnic costumes talking intimately and making friends. In the evening, they held a get-together with forty combat heroes and model figures from the Kunming Military Region. The programs they performed received warm applause. (Zhang)
