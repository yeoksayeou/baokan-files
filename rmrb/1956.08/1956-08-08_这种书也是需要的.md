    Since the discussion of "Dream of the Red Chamber" began, some people have become alarmed at the sight of textual research articles.

    There was a critical article published in the sixth issue of "Wenyi Xuexi" in 1956, "On the Characters in Lu Xun's Novels." The author believed that Zhou Xiasou (the author of "The Characters in Lu Xun's Novels") used bourgeois idealist methods to conduct textual research on the characters in Lu Xun's novels, and that it "stripped away the social significance and ideological significance of the typical images of Mr. Lu Xun's great works," "guided readers not to seriously consider the ideological content of the works, but to fall into the quagmire of petty bourgeois low-level interests," and "therefore, it has considerable deceptiveness and serious harm," and so on. This kind of criticism is unfounded, because Zhou Xiasou's "The Characters in Lu Xun's Novels" is not a textual research article, nor is it an analysis of literary works, but a memoir. These articles provide a lot of information for further research on Lu Xun's novels. Some of the local artifacts, dialects, customs, and habits in Lu Xun's novels are not understood by outsiders, and this book also explains them.

    Are these materials useful? I think they are useful. Discovering and mastering the sources of a writer's creative materials, and then exploring his process of refining and typifying the materials, is of great significance to the study of a writer. Now, we do not have too much material on Lu Xun's creative materials, but too little. For example, Zhou Xiasou's record of Lu Xun's cousin Liu Si suffering from "persecution mania" was personally experienced by Lu Xun. This is related to Lu Xun's creation of "A Madman's Diary." We can also see from these materials how Lu Xun refined this ordinary event into an anti-feudal novel with strong combat effectiveness.

    Criticism should be based on specific content, and demands beyond the content of the article should not be made. We cannot demand that a barbershop must sell cigarettes, nor can we demand that a cigarette stand must give customers haircuts. Unfortunately, there are many such unreasonable buyers now.

    这种书也是需要的

    自从“红楼梦”的讨论开展以后，有些人一见考据的文章，就心惊肉跳。
    发表在“文艺学习”1956年第六期的有一篇“关于‘鲁迅小说里的人物’”的批评文章，作者以为周遐寿（“鲁迅小说里的人物”的作者）是用资产阶级唯心主义的方法来考证鲁迅小说中的人物，是“抽去了鲁迅先生伟大著作的社会意义和典型形象的思想意义”是“引导读者不对作品的思想内容进行严肃的思考，而堕入小市民的低级趣味的泥坑”，“因而它就带有相当大的欺骗性和严重的危害性”云云。这种批评是无的放矢的，因为周遐寿的“鲁迅小说里的人物”并不是什么考证文章，也不是文学作品的分析，而是回忆小品。这些文章提供了不少有关进一步研究鲁迅小说的资料。鲁迅小说里有些关于乡土的文物方言，风俗习惯，外方人不是都能了解的，这本书里也作了说明。
    这些资料是不是有用呢？我以为是有用的。发现和掌握一个作家的创作素材的来源，从而探讨他对于素材的提炼和典型化的过程，对于研究一个作家是有很大意义的。现在，我们对于鲁迅创作素材这方面的材料，不是掌握得太多，而是太少。像周遐寿所记的关于鲁迅的表兄弟刘四得了“追害狂”的事，是鲁迅亲身经历的。这和鲁迅创作“狂人日记”是有关系的，我们也可以从这些资料中看出鲁迅如何把这一件普普通通的事，提炼成一篇反封建的、具有强烈的战斗性的小说。
    批评应该根据具体内容，不能提出文章内容以外的要求。我们不能要求理发店一定得卖烟卷，也不能要求香烟摊子得给顾客理发，可惜现在这种不近人情的买主却很多。
