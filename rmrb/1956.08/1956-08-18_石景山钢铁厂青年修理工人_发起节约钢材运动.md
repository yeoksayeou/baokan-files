    Youth Repair Workers at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    Initiate Steel Conservation Campaign

    (Our dispatch) Beginning in August, the youth repair workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a steel conservation campaign. This campaign was initiated by the Sun Wantong team from the repair and installation workshop of the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office. On August 2nd, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Youth League Committee convened a meeting of repair workers from eight workshops, including the iron smelting department and the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office. After introducing the Sun Wantong team's achievements in saving the state 6,500 kilograms of steel in half a year, all the youth repair workers in the plant unanimously agreed to launch a steel conservation campaign throughout the plant.

    In the past half-month, the youth repair workers throughout the plant have been trying every means to utilize waste materials and save steel. When the Liu Yongmao forging team from the repair and installation workshop of the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office was making chain plates for coal washing, they utilized waste materials and saved more than 900 kilograms of steel. These waste materials were proactively sourced from the waste material depot by the transportation team of the work section, and found in the waste material pile by Youth League member Ma Yuzhen. When riveter Zhang Shuangmu was making a sampling platform for the chemical workshop, he originally planned to use new materials, and the materials had already been collected. Later, they found usable waste materials in the waste material depot and returned the new materials they had collected. Under the enthusiastic influence of the forgers and riveters, the workers in the repair distribution depot proactively fenced off an open space next to the workshop with wire, gathered the picked-up waste materials, and prepared to supply the needs of various workshops.

    Although the work of the young fitters cannot save large quantities of steel like the forgers and riveters, they can also save small quantities of steel. They have set up a special "treasure basin" in the workshop to collect unused small parts such as screws, which can be processed and repaired for reuse, thus saving steel for the country. Under the promotion of the young workers, the master craftsmen in the fitter team of the coal washing workshop are also actively taking action. In the first half of the month, this team has saved about 1,000 kilograms of steel.

    In order to make the steel conservation campaign regular, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Youth League Committee issued a steel conservation manual to the youth repair workers on the 17th, calling on every worker to fill in their steel conservation achievements in the manual at any time, and prepare to summarize and commend them on a monthly basis. At the same time, it was proposed that safety and production quality should be guaranteed in steel conservation. (Ping)

### 石景山钢铁厂青年修理工人  发起节约钢材运动

    石景山钢铁厂青年修理工人
    发起节约钢材运动
    本报讯　从八月份起，石景山钢铁厂的青年修理工人开展了一个节约钢材运动。这次运动是由总机械师室修理安装车间的孙万通小组倡议的。青年团石景山钢铁厂委员会在八月二日召开了炼铁部和总机械师室等八个车间的修理工人大会，会上介绍了孙万通小组在半年中给国家节约了六千五百公斤钢材的情况以后，全厂青年修理工人一致同意在全厂开展一个节约钢材运动。
    半月来，全厂青年修理工人都在想尽一切办法利用废料，节约钢材。总机械师室修理安装车间刘永茂锻工小组做洗煤用的链子板时，利用废料，节约了钢材九百多公斤。这些废料都是由工段的运输小组主动向废料库联系，由青年团员马玉珍在废料堆中找出来的。铆工张双目为化工车间做取样平台时，原来计划用新料，料已领出，后来他们在废料库中找到可以利用的废料，又把领来的新料退回去。修理分库的工人们在锻工和铆工的热情影响下，主动在车间的旁边用铁丝围起一块空地，把拣来的废料集中起来，准备供应各车间的需要。
    青年钳工的工作虽然不能像锻工和铆工那样能够节约大钢材，但也能节约小钢材。他们在车间里特别设立了一个“聚宝盆”，把不用的螺丝等小零件集中起来，加工修理后，又可以用，这样为国家节约钢材。洗煤车间的钳工小组，在青年工人的推动下，老师傅们也积极行动起来了。在上半个月内，这个小组已节约了钢材一千公斤左右。
    青年团石景山钢铁厂委员会为了使节约钢材运动能够经常化，在十七日给青年修理工人发了一本节约手册，号召每一个工人把自己节约钢材的情况随时填在手册上，准备按月总结，进行表扬。同时提出在节约钢材中，还要保证安全和生产的质量。　（平）
