    Human Fossils in Guangxi Caves
    Pei Wenzhong
    The recent discovery of abundant and important human fossils in Guangxi caves is inseparable from the long-term use of "dragon bones" as a medicinal material by the Chinese people.

    "Dragon bones" are fossils of ancient vertebrate bones. Since about two thousand years ago in the Han Dynasty, Chinese physicians have used "dragon bones" as hemostatic and sedative agents in internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics. Because humans lacked knowledge of paleontology at the time, and because the Chinese feudal ruling class at the time fabricated a mythological animal called "dragon" to fool the ruled people, this medicinal material was called "dragon bones," and animal tooth fossils were called "dragon teeth."

    In China's long feudal society, scientists of past dynasties were limited by the historical conditions of the time, and could only discuss the non-existent "dragon," and could not study "dragon bones" from the perspective of paleontology. Of course, they did have scientific analyses of the medical properties and effects of "dragon bones," as well as their place of origin and cause of formation.

    From another perspective, because of the long-term use of "dragon bones" in traditional Chinese medicine, the broad masses of the Chinese people became acquainted with "dragon bones," which led to many important discoveries.

    The discovery of the world-renowned Peking Man was due to the discovery of "dragon bones" in the caves by workers burning lime at Zhoukoudian.

    Since the liberation of mainland China in 1949, the Central People's Government has repeatedly issued notices to the whole country to pay attention to the protection of ancient cultural relics discovered underground in the motherland. The people have also been educated in patriotism, and they attach great importance to the cultural relics discovered underground in the motherland, reporting to the government or handing over the discoveries to the government.

    Regarding human fossils, the first discovery was in 1951 in Ziyang County, Sichuan, where a human skull fossil was found. The second was in 1954 in Dingcun, Xiangfen County, Shanxi, where three fossil teeth of Paleolithic humans and a large number of crudely made stone tools from the Paleolithic Age were discovered. The former discovery was due to workers discovering "dragon bones" while excavating the bridge foundation of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and human fossils were found in the "dragon bones," which the workers handed over to the cultural department. The latter discovery was also due to workers discovering "dragon bones" while digging sand, which led to formal excavation.

    In recent years, the people of Guangxi Province have written letters to the People's Government reporting the production of "dragon bones" in mountain caves in many areas, and often sending specimens to cultural institutions or the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to this, a Dutchman named Koeningswald had discovered several "Gigantopithecus" teeth in "dragon teeth" purchased from Chinese pharmacies (later some people believed that "Gigantopithecus" might be "Gigantanthropus"). Based on letters from the broad masses of the people, Chinese scientists believed that "Gigantopithecus" was likely produced in the caves of Guangxi. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences dispatched a working team to Guangxi at the beginning of this year to investigate and study the deposits in the caves and the "dragon bone" fossils within them.

    With the strong assistance of the Guangxi Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the "dragon bones" purchased by cooperative societies over the years were concentrated in Nanning for inspection by the working team. As a result of the inspection, the working team discovered not only many valuable mammalian fossils, but also nine "Gigantopithecus" teeth and a type of hominid tooth.

    Later, more than twenty "Gigantopithecus" teeth were discovered in a large number of "dragon bones" from the export company in Guangzhou.

    The working team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with the Guangxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau and guided by local people, investigated more than 200 caves in seven counties, including Laibin, Shanglin, Liujiang, Wuming, Daxin, Fusui, and Chongzuo in Guangxi Province, from January to March this year, and conducted more detailed studies and small-scale excavations in individual caves.

    As a result of this field work, in addition to the discovery of many types of mammalian fossils, fossils related to humans and near-humans were also discovered. In a cave in Daxin County, a "Gigantopithecus" tooth was found. This is the first known location, cave, and stratum of "Gigantopithecus" production. It was found in the hard soil and stone deposits in the cave, and it coexisted with pandas, brown apes, and mammalian fossils commonly found in caves in southern China. Further research may clarify the question of whether it is "Gigantopithecus" or "Gigantanthropus," and at the same time, it can reveal the natural environment in which this advanced primate lived and the reasons for its development in such a huge direction.

    In addition, the working team also discovered a Paleolithic human fossil in a cave in Helong Village, Laibin County, in a hard deposit, including a part of the back lower portion of the skull, the upper jawbone and several heavily worn teeth, and a single upper molar. These specimens are currently being repaired.

    In many caves, fragmentary and rather large tooth fossils that resemble both humans and apes have been found, and are now being studied by anthropologists.

    Human fossils and a large number of cultural relics and animal bones from the Neolithic Age have also been found in the Guangxi caves.

    This preliminary work and discovery in Guangxi fully demonstrates that in the vast area of Guangxi, there are limestone caves; the caves all have fossil-containing deposits, which contain abundant fossils from all stages of human development. This also shows that during the Quaternary period, the Guangxi region had an excellent natural environment, and the ancestors of mankind grew and multiplied here, living in limestone caves, carrying out arduous struggles with nature, overcoming difficulties, and becoming the masters of the world.

    Continued and more in-depth research on human fossils in Guangxi caves will undoubtedly make more contributions to the history of human development.

    广西山洞中的人类化石
    裴文中
    最近在广西山洞里发见了丰富而重要的人类化石，这是同中国人民把“龙骨”当作一种药材长期地使用分不开的。
    “龙骨”就是古代脊椎动物骨胳的化石。大约从二千年以前的汉代起，中国医药学家就使用“龙骨”作内科、妇科、小儿科的止血剂和镇定剂。因为当时人类对于古生物学知识还很贫乏，又因为当时的中国封建统治阶级为了愚弄被统治的人民，而臆造了一种神话化的动物“龙”，所以当时就把这一种药材叫做“龙骨”，动物牙齿的化石叫做“龙齿”。
    在中国长期的封建社会里，历代的科学家受了当时历史条件的限制，只在根本不存在的“龙”字上进行讨论，而不能从古生物的分类上研究“龙骨”，当然他们对“龙骨”在医疗上的性质和作用以及它的产地和生成的原因等，都有了科学的分析。
    从另一方面看，由于中药医疗中长期使用“龙骨”，中国广大的人民群众因而认识了“龙骨”，又因而引起了许多的重要的发现。
    世界知名的中国猿人的发现，是由于周口店烧石灰的工人发现山洞中有“龙骨”而引起的。
    从1949年中国大陆解放以后，中央人民政府对于祖国地下发现的古代文物一再通令全国注意保护，人民群众也受了爱国主义教育，对于祖国地下发现的文物更十分重视，纷纷向政府报告或者把发现的东西交给政府。
    关于人类化石方面，首先于1951年的时候，在四川资阳县发现了真人的化石头骨，其次是于1954年在山西襄汾县丁村发现了旧石器时代的人类三枚牙齿的化石和大量的旧石器时代的粗制的石器。前者的发现，是因为工人挖掘成渝铁路的桥基而发现“龙骨”，在“龙骨”中发现了人的化石，工人们交给了文化部门的。后者的发现，也是因为工人们在挖砂时发现了“龙骨”去正式发掘发现的。
    近几年以来，广西省人民群众，纷纷向人民政府写信报告在许多地区的山洞中出产“龙骨”，并且经常把标本寄交文化机关或者中国科学院。在这以前，曾经有一个荷兰人孔尼华在我国药店中购买的“龙齿”中发现了几枚“巨猿”的牙齿（后来又有人认为“巨猿”可能是“巨人”）。我国科学家们根据广大人民的来信，认为很可能“巨猿”是广西的山洞中出产的。因此，中国科学院在今年初派遣了一个工作队，到广西去调查和研究山洞中的堆积和其中的“龙骨”化石。
    由于广西省供销合作社联社的大力协助，把各地合作社历年所收购的“龙骨”集中在南宁，由工作队进行检查。检查结果，工作队除了发现许多种有价值的哺乳动物化石以外，还发现了九枚“巨猿”的和一种似人的牙齿。
    以后，在广州的出口公司的大量的“龙骨”中，又发现了二十多个“巨猿”的牙齿。
    中国科学院的工作队同广西省文化事业管理局合作，在当地人民向导下，从今年一月到三月间，在广西来宾、上林、柳江、武鸣、大新、扶绥、崇左等七个县境内，调查了二百多个山洞，并且在个别的山洞中，进行了比较详细的研究和小规模的发掘。
    这个野外工作的结果，除了发现许多种的哺乳动物化石以外，还发现了关于人和近于人类的化石。在大新县的一个山洞中，发现了一枚“巨猿”的牙齿。这是第一次知道的“巨猿”出产的地点、山洞和地层。它是在山洞里坚硬的土石堆积中发现的，它同熊猫、褐猿以及江南山洞中常见的哺乳动物化石共生。进一步的研究，可能澄清究竟是“巨猿”或者“巨人”的问题，同时可以知道这种高等的灵长类动物生活的自然环境以及为什么向这样巨大的方向发展的原因。
    另外，这个工作队在来宾县合隆村的一个山洞里，在坚硬的堆积中，还发现了一种旧石器时代的人类化石，计有头骨后部下面一部分，上颌骨和几个磨蚀很深的牙齿，还有一个单独的上臼齿。现在这些标本还正在修理中。
    在许多的山洞中，还发现了似人又似猿的零星的、相当巨大的牙齿化石，现在正由人类学家进行研究。
    在广西的山洞中，还找到了真人的化石和新石器时代的大批文化遗物和当时的动物骨胳。
    在广西的这个初步的工作和发现完全说明：在广西的广大区域中，有石灰岩生成的山洞；山洞里都有含化石的堆积，其中蕴藏着丰富的人类发展各阶段的化石。这也可以说明，当第四纪的时期，广西这个地区有优良的自然环境，人类的祖先生长和繁殖在这里，生活在石灰岩的山洞中，同自然界进行艰苦的斗争，战胜了困难，成了世界上的主人。
    继续和更深入地对于广西山洞中的人类化石进行研究，没有疑问将对人类发展的历史，有更多的贡献。
