    Unforgettable Twenty-Four Hours
    By Zhǎn Cháo, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

    An airplane, laden with friendship, flew from the north and slowly landed at Gia Lam Airport in Hanoi.

    Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and the delegation of the Royal Lao Government concluded their friendly visit to China and arrived in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as guests. The Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are neighbors, both Indochinese countries, sharing a common border of over a thousand kilometers from north to south. The peoples of the two countries have enjoyed traditional friendship since ancient times, and in the past century, they have suffered from the same foreign colonialist aggressors and rulers. It is particularly significant that many leaders of the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once studied in Hanoi, some even being old classmates and friends in the same school and class. Now, when their respective countries have gained peace and independence, they meet again in this very beautiful city, which records their youthful friendship.

    After receiving a grand welcome at the airport, the delegation of the Royal Lao Government took cars across the Long Bien Bridge, which they had been away from for many years, passed through the center of Hanoi, circled half of the picturesque Hoan Kiem Lake, and then headed towards the Presidential Palace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. There, President Ho Chi Minh warmly received Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith, and all members of the delegation, and invited them to lunch together. President Ho Chi Minh said, "Since ancient times, Vietnam and Laos have been two neighboring countries, and our two peoples are brothers. But for nearly a century, the vicious imperialists have alienated us and separated our two peoples. Thanks to the patriotic spirit of our two peoples, and thanks to the unity and heroic struggle of our two peoples, the imperialists have been driven away, and our countries have achieved independence. We believe that the time has come to restore our brotherly relations." Prince Souvanna Phouma said, "In the past, both of our countries were enslaved, and we have always had close relations. Today, our two countries are two independent countries, so there is no reason or anything that can hinder the development and consolidation of this friendship."

    During the lunch, Prince Souvanna Phouma proposed that everyone toast to the health of President Ho Chi Minh and to the development and consolidation of the friendship between the two countries. President Ho Chi Minh proposed a toast to the health of the King of Laos, to the health of Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and the entire delegation, and to the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and Laos. President Ho Chi Minh entrusted Prince Souvanna Phouma with some of his personal gifts—a set of exquisite silver tableware, etc.—to be given to the King of Laos. President Ho Chi Minh said that he was willing to give a gift from the Chinese people to the youngest member of the delegation of the Royal Lao Government (two Chinese-made pens and pencils in a beautiful red velvet box). As a result, Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith's daughter, Suphang, received the gift. In this informal, family-style lunch, the delegation of the Royal Lao Government enjoyed delicious Vietnamese cuisine.

    In the afternoon, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of the Kingdom of Laos began talks. Deputy Prime Minister Vo Nguyen Giap and Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith, along with more than ten other people, also participated in the talks. Other members of the delegation of the Royal Lao Government visited the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Women's Union.

    At the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Chairman Ton Duc Thang and Vice Chairman Ton Quang Phiet warmly received the guests. Standing Committee member Nguyen Thi Thuc Vien and Phongsavanh Souphanouvong, a member of the Lao Kingdom Parliament, were classmates at Hanoi Normal University. They had been separated for nearly thirty years and now reunited, chatting happily.

    The female guests in the delegation of the Royal Lao Government visited the Vietnam Women's Union. The hosts and guests were very affectionate when they met. They exchanged greetings and chatted casually about family matters. Mrs. Katay Don Sasorith said: Seeing you treat us so warmly, I am reminded of my days in China. I miss Beijing very much and dream of Beijing. General Sonthon Pathammavong's wife said: I hope that we can visit you again soon. Nguyen Thi Thap, chairwoman of the Vietnam Women's Union, said: We would also very much like to visit your beautiful capital, Vientiane, in Laos. Many guests agreed, saying that the women of our two countries are sisters, and we are united. Laos has a women's association, and Vietnam also has a women's association. We can often talk together in the future. We are very close neighbors, and it only takes two hours by plane to meet. The women of Vietnam and Laos also talked about peace and the happiness of their children. Vietnamese women gave gifts such as hand-embroidered bibs to the Lao women. Afterwards, they toured the streets of Hanoi together.

    In the evening, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong held a grand banquet to entertain Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and all members of the delegation of the Royal Lao Government. On one side were classmates from the Hanoi Lycée Albert Sarraut era: Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, and Dr. Pham Ngoc Thach, Deputy Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; on the other side were classmates from Hanoi University: Katay Don Sasorith, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, and Hoang Minh Giam, Minister of Culture of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Nguyen Khanh Toan, Deputy Minister of Education. People toasted each other for health and friendship. After the banquet, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and many leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam accompanied Prince Souvanna Phouma and the delegation of the Royal Lao Government to spend a joyful evening at the Hanoi Opera House, enjoying various beautiful singing and dancing programs performed by Vietnamese artists.

    The next morning, the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Royal Lao Government continued their talks in an atmosphere of intimacy and mutual understanding, and achieved good results. Finally, both parties jointly signed a joint statement. The statement affirmed the traditional good neighborly relations between Vietnam and Laos since ancient times and believed that in the new situation, for the common interests of the people of the two countries, this traditional friendship must be restored and developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    The photographer quickly captured the solemn signing ceremony with his lens.

    Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma shook hands intimately and then took a car together to Gia Lam Airport. Countless bouquets of flowers were given to Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and other guests. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said, "We are only saying 'farewell for now' today. We believe that in the near future, in Hanoi and in Vientiane, economic and friendly relations between Laos and Vietnam will be realized."

    From 10:10 a.m. on August 28 to 10:45 a.m. on August 29, the leaders of the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos completed tremendous work in this short period of twenty-four hours. They laid the foundation for the restoration and development of traditional friendship between two close neighbors. This historically significant day will forever be recorded in the annals of friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and Laos.

    难忘的二十四小时
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    一架满载着友情的飞机，从北方飞来，徐徐地降落在河内嘉林飞机场上。
    梭发那·富马首相和老挝王国政府代表团结束了他们在中国的友好访问，又来到越南民主共和国的首都作客。老挝王国同越南民主共和国毗邻而居，同是印度支那国家，从北到南有着连延上千公里长的共同的边界。两国人民自古就有着传统的友谊，近百年来又遭受到同一的外来殖民主义者的侵略和统治。特别有意义的是，老挝王国和越南民主共和国的许多领导人，过去都曾经在河内读过书，有的还是在一个学校、一个班级的老同学和老朋友。现在，当他们各自的国家都获得了和平、独立的时候，他们又在这个非常美丽的、记载着青年时代友谊的城市里相会了。
    老挝王国政府代表团在飞机场上接受了隆重的欢迎之后，乘坐汽车通过久别多年的龙编大铁桥，经过河内市区的中心，在富有诗情画意的还剑湖边兜了半个圈子，然后驰向越南民主共和国主席府。在这里，胡志明主席亲切地接见了老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王、副首相卡代和代表团全体人员，并且请他们共同进午餐。胡志明主席说：“自古以来，越南和老挝是两个毗邻的国家，我们两国人民是兄弟。但是近一世纪来，凶恶的帝国主义离间我们，将我们两国人民分离开来。由于我们两国人民的爱国精神，由于我们两国人民的团结和英勇斗争，帝国主义已经被赶走，我们的国家已经取得独立。我们认为恢复我们的兄弟关系的时候已经到了。”梭发那·富马亲王说：“以前，我们两国都是被奴役的，我们素来就有着密切的关系。今天，我们两国已经是两个独立的国家，因此就没有任何理由、也没有什么东西能够阻挠这种友谊的发展和巩固。”
    午餐进行中，梭发那·富马亲王提议大家为胡志明主席的健康、为两国友谊的发展和巩固干杯。胡志明主席提议为老挝国王的健康、为梭发那·富马首相和代表团全体的健康、为越南和老挝两国人民牢不可破的友谊干杯。胡志明主席将他个人的一些礼物——一部精致的银质餐具等，托梭发那·富马亲王转送给老挝国王。胡志明主席说，他愿意把一件中国人民送给他的礼物（二对装在美丽的红绒盒子里的中国制造的钢笔和铅笔），转送给老挝王国政府代表团里最年轻的一位团员。结果卡代副首相的女儿苏芳接受了这个礼物。在这个不拘仪式的、家庭式的午餐里，老挝王国政府代表团吃到了美味的越南菜肴。
    下午，越南民主共和国范文同总理和老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王开始会谈。参加会谈的还有武元甲副总理和卡代副首相等十余人。老挝王国政府代表团的其他一些人则分别访问了越南民主共和国国民大会常务委员会和越南妇女联合会。
    在越南民主共和国国民大会，孙德胜委员长和孙光阀副委员长热情地接待着客人们。常务委员阮氏淑媛和老挝王国议会议员彭·苏发那冯是河内师范大学的同学，他们分别将近三十年了，现在又在一起聚首，愉快地畅谈着。
    到越南妇女联合会去作客的，是老挝王国政府代表团里的女宾们。宾主见面，十分亲热。她们互相问寒问暖，随便叙述着家常。卡代夫人说：见到你们这样亲切地款待我们，我又想起在中国的日子，我很想念北京，做梦也梦见北京。顺吞·巴探马冯将军夫人说：但愿不很久，我们再来访问你们。越南妇女联合会主席阮氏十说：我们也非常愿意到老挝美丽的首都万象访问你们。许多客人都表示同意说，我们两国妇女是姊妹，我们团结在一起了。老挝有妇女会，越南也有妇女会，以后可以经常在一块交谈，我们是非常近的邻居，坐飞机只要两个钟头就能见面。越南和老挝的妇女们还谈到了和平，谈到了孩子们的幸福。越南妇女把亲手刺绣的胸围等礼物赠送给老挝妇女。随后，她们一起游览了河内的街市。
    黄昏的时候，范文同总理举行盛大酒会，欢宴梭发那·富马首相和老挝王国政府代表团全体团员。这边是当年河内阿比沙罗中学时代的同学：老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王和越南民主共和国卫生部副部长范玉石博士；那边是当年河内大学的同学：老挝王国副首相卡代和越南民主共和国文化部部长黄明鉴，教育部副部长阮庆全。人们互相举杯祝贺健康和友谊。酒会后，范文同总理和越南民主共和国的许多领导人，又陪同梭发那·富马亲王和老挝王国政府代表团，在河内大戏院里度过欢乐的夜晚，欣赏了越南艺术家们表演的各种优美的歌舞节目。
    第二天早上，越南民主共和国政府代表团和老挝王国政府代表团继续在亲密的、互相谅解的气氛中进行会谈，并且取得了良好的结果。最后双方共同签署一项联合声明。这个声明肯定了越南和老挝两国自古就有的传统的睦邻关系，认为在新的形势下，为了两国人民的共同利益，必须在和平共处五项原则的基础上恢复和发展这种传统的友谊。
    摄影师把庄严的签字仪式迅速地收进了镜头。
    范文同总理和梭发那·富马首相亲密地握手，然后一起乘车到嘉林机场。无数束鲜花送到梭发那·富马首相和其他客人们的手里。梭发那·富马首相说，我们今天只是“暂别”，我们相信，在最近的将来，在河内以及在万象，老挝和越南的经济关系和友好关系将会实现。
    从8月28日上午十时十分到8月29日上午十时四十五分，在这短短的二十四小时内，越南民主共和国和老挝王国政府的领导人已经完成了巨大的工作。他们为两个亲近的邻居之间恢复和发展传统的友谊奠定了基础。这个富有历史意义的日子，将永远记载在越南和老挝两国人民的友谊的史册中。
