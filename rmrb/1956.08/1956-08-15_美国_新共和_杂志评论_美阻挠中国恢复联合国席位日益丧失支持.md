Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 14th: The American magazine "New Republic" published an editorial on August 13th, warning the Democratic and Republican parties not to "rigidly" include clauses in their election platforms that refuse to allow China to enter the United Nations, so as not to "backfire and cause headaches for the winning party in the election," because this proposition is increasingly losing support from other countries.

The magazine pointed out that the majority of NATO member states and "free Asian countries," including Pakistan, which has a military alliance with the United States, advocate admitting China into the United Nations. The recently held Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference also agreed with this point.

    美国“新共和”杂志评论
    美阻挠中国恢复联合国席位日益丧失支持
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：八月十三日的美国“新共和”杂志发表社论，警告民主党和共和党不要“刻板地”在它们的竞选政纲中列入拒绝让中国进入联合国的条文，以免“回过头来使得在大选中取胜的党头痛”，因为这种主张已经愈来愈得不到别的国家的支持。
    这家杂志指出，北大西洋集团的多数成员国和包括同美国有军事同盟关系的巴基斯坦在内的“亚洲自由国家”都主张接纳中国进入联合国。不久以前举行的英联邦总理会议也同意这一点。
