On "Closed-Door Policy"
    Kong Sang

On the issue of developing local industries, some people still adopt a "closed-door" policy today. Please read the letter from reader Lu Ren:

    "I am a worker who recently transferred from Tianjin to work in Taiyuan. When I was in Tianjin, we all used 'Zhongzhi Soap' produced by the China Oil and Fat Chemical Plant to wash clothes. This soap costs seven cents a piece and is of good quality, but it is not available in Taiyuan. We have to use the soap produced by the Taiyuan Soap Factory. The price of this soap is not low, but the quality is terrible. It not only does not clean clothes well, but also turns white clothes yellowish-black. At first, I thought that 'Zhongzhi Soap' was produced in small quantities, which is why it was not sold in Taiyuan. Later, a fellow townsman who works in the Taiyuan Department Store told me that it was because they were afraid that the products of the Taiyuan Soap Factory would not sell, so they did not supply 'Zhongzhi Soap' to the citizens..."

This practice of digging moats between regions and using administrative means to exclude inexpensive and high-quality products from other places is by no means isolated. These comrades advocate a closed-door policy, supposedly to boost the local economy; however, the methods they adopt are to protect the backward and exclude the advanced.

However, can the "gate" really be closed? With the prohibition of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at the top, and the opposition of millions of consumers at the bottom, the "gate" cannot be closed. In the past few years, in order to "protect" the local leather shoe industry, Liaoning Province adopted prices that were 30% to 50% higher for leather shoes from the south. What was the result? The result was that it increased the burden on consumers. Some people who were unwilling to pay high prices and unwilling to buy local leather shoes asked others or bought them from the south through the post office. As for the factories being "protected," they were like being given an anesthetic, always thinking that they were not bad, and that their annual plans were completed well. In fact, until now, the products are still of poor quality and high price.

Some local industrial products in Beijing, such as wool textiles and enamelware, have made rapid progress, almost catching up with the most advanced levels in the country. These enterprises have not received the "protection" of a "closed door." Also, because there is no "protection," the workers always feel the need to quickly improve their skills. They opened the "gate," looked around the world, and when they saw advanced experience somewhere, they invited people in to teach, or sent people out to learn.

Therefore, if you want to seriously develop local industries, opening the "gate" is much better than "closing the door."

    论“闭关自守”
    孔桑
    在发展地方工业的问题上，今天还有人采用“闭关自守”的方针。请看读者陆仁的来信：
    “我是最近由天津调来太原工作的一个工人。在天津时，我们都用中国油脂化学厂出产的‘中植皂’洗衣服。这种肥皂每块七分钱，质量很好，但在太原买不到。我们只好使用太原肥皂厂生产的肥皂。这种肥皂的价钱不算低，质量可太坏，不仅洗不净衣服，而且把白衣服染成黄黑色的。起初，我以为‘中植皂’的产量少，太原才没有卖的。后来，在太原市百货公司工作的一位同乡告诉我：那是因为怕太原肥皂厂的产品滞销，才不向市民供应‘中植皂’。……”
    这种在地区之间挖壕沟，以行政手段排挤外地价廉物美的产品的做法，绝不是个别的。这些同志提倡闭关自守，据说是为了繁荣地方经济；但是他们采用的方法却是保护落后，排挤先进。
    然而，“关”是闭得住的吗？上有党中央和国务院的制止，下有千百万消费者的反对，“关”是关不住的了。几年来，辽宁省为了“保护”地方皮鞋工业，对南方来的皮鞋采用了高达30％到50％的价格出售。结果怎么样呢？结果是加重了消费者的负担，有些既不甘心出高价，又不愿意买当地皮鞋的人，就托人或者通过邮局到南方去买。而被“保护”的工厂呢，则像吃了麻醉药一样，总以为自己很不坏，年年计划都完成得不错。其实，直到现在，产品依然是质次价高。
    北京市的一些地方工业产品，如毛纺织品、搪瓷品之类，进步很快，差不多赶上国内最先进的水平了。这些企业并没有得到“闭关”的“保护”。也因为没有“保护”，职工们才时刻感到有迅速提高技术的必要。他们打开“关”门，环视宇内，看见哪里有先进经验，就请人进来教，或者派人出去学。
    所以，要想认真的发展地方工业，打开“关”门实在比“闭关自守”高明得多。
