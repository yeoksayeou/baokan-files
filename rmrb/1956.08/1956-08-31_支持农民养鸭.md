    Supporting Farmers in Duck Raising

    (Our report) This newspaper reports that various regions in the Fuzhou Special District of Jiangxi Province are encouraging farmers to massively breed export-quality ducks and develop duck-raising production. In Linchuan County, five hatcheries have 4,000+ mother ducks, and in the spring hatching alone, they have produced 45,000 ducklings. Now they are actively preparing breeding eggs and preparing for autumn hatching. To solve the technical issues of duck hatching, the Livestock Products Company has sent technicians to various townships in Yihuang County to guide hatchery production. In Nanfeng County, where people were not accustomed to raising ducks in the past, this year, with the assistance of the local Food Company and Supply and Marketing Cooperative, agricultural cooperatives such as Peishan and Baishe in the county have also purchased more than 8,000 ducklings. The Nanfeng Supply and Marketing Cooperative is also searching for duck sources in various places, and the county plans to develop a flock of 20,000 ducks this year. To cooperate with the development of duck raising, the Special District Agricultural Bank has now issued loans, and the Grain Bureau supplies 5-7 catties of grain per duck depending on the situation. The Yihuang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also signed sales contracts with the hatcheries. The entire district is expected to produce 150,000 ducklings this year, laying a favorable foundation for future duck-raising production. (Chen Daonan)

    支持农民养鸭
    本报讯　江西省抚州专区各地鼓励农民大量孵育口岸鸭，发展养鸭生产，临川县五个孵房有四千多只母鸭，仅春孵就已产小鸭四万五千只，现在又积极筹备种蛋、准备秋孵。为了解决孵鸭技术，畜产公司派出技工深入宜黄县各乡指导孵房生产。南丰县过去不习惯养鸭，今年在当地食品公司和供销社协助下，该县沛山、白舍等农业社也购来小鸭八千多只。现南丰供销社还在各地寻找鸭源，全县计划今年发展群鸭二万只。配合养鸭的发展，专区农业银行，现已发放了贷款，粮食局根据情况给每只鸭供应粮食五到七斤，宜黄县供销合作社并和孵房订立销售合约，全区今年预计将生产小鸭十五万只。为今后养鸭生产打下了有利基础。（陈道南）
