    Rockets and missiles have a close connection in development. A rocket is a type of jet engine. A missile, however, is an unmanned aircraft that relies on the power of a jet engine to fly.
    Rocket jet engines have two different types: liquid fuel and solid fuel. Early rockets were solid-fuel. During the early Tang Dynasty, Chinese alchemists first invented gunpowder. According to the History of the Song Dynasty, in the third year of Xianping during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Northern Song Dynasty (1000 AD), Tang Fu presented rockets and other gunpowder weapons to the court. Later, this weapon was used in the wars between the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties.
    Around the 13th century, the rockets invented in China were introduced to Arab countries, and then passed on to Europe by the Arabs. Since the 20th century, modern science has developed greatly. Rockets have also developed from solid fuel to liquid fuel. The great Soviet scholar Tsiolkovsky made great contributions in this area. He proposed using alcohol, gasoline, etc. as fuel, and liquid oxygen as an oxidant, and in 1903 published the famous paper "Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices," laying the theoretical foundation for space flight. Subsequently, scholars in France, the United States, and Germany also conducted considerable research.
    As a power device that generates reaction thrust, the greatest advantage of a rocket is that it can fly not only in the extremely thin air of high altitudes but also in a vacuum. This is because it carries not only fuel but also an oxidant to aid combustion. Relying on the mixing and combustion of the two in the combustion chamber, and ejecting backward through the nozzle to generate reaction thrust, it can move forward in space. Oxidants and fuels are collectively referred to as propellants. A liquid fuel rocket is one in which the propellant is liquid; similarly, a rocket in which the propellant is solid is called a solid fuel rocket.
    In the military field: it is required that the rocket consume less propellant per second while generating greater thrust. The thrust of the liquid fuel rocket that appeared at the end of World War II was 25.5 tons, and now it has long exceeded this value.
    More than a thousand kinds of liquid propellants have been tested in the past ten years, but perhaps no more than ten are good oxidants. Commonly used ones include liquid oxygen, nitric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. There are many suitable fuels, such as alcohol, gasoline, hydrazine, and liquid hydrogen. The most important components of a liquid rocket are the combustion chamber and the nozzle. Since the combustion temperature is as high as 2,000 to 3,000 degrees Celsius, scientists are working hard to solve the problem of heat transfer in the combustion chamber. Recently, several new cooling methods have achieved great success.
    Solid-fuel rockets formerly used black powder as a propellant. Currently, a mixed solid of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, as well as a small amount of additives, is mostly used. This solid propellant is usually made into strips, called grains. The design of the grain shape is very important because it is closely related to the burning time, thrust, and ignition.
    The two types of rockets have their own characteristics. Liquid fuel rockets generate greater thrust per kilogram of propellant consumed per second, and can also carry more propellant, extending the working time to tens of minutes. Solid-fuel rockets have a very simple structure and are easier to use, but the solid propellant must be installed in the rocket's own combustion chamber, so it cannot be loaded much, resulting in a very short working time, only a few seconds or tens of seconds. At present, they are widely used in different types of missiles.
    In addition, a photon rocket is also being studied. The working principle of a photon rocket is to rely on the ejection of a stream of light particles (i.e., photons) to generate reaction thrust. In theory, this rocket can obtain a huge speed close to the speed of light. However, it is still far from the practical stage.
    A missile is an unmanned aircraft that moves forward by relying on the power of a jet engine; it relies on a certain amount of power, and is controlled from a distance through a certain mechanism, and can fly to a predetermined target according to the will of the controller. Because it was developed in warfare and was first used in offensive weapons, it is called a missile.
    Missiles first appeared in World War II. These were the V-1 and V-2 used by Germany. After the war, this missile weapon was further developed. Currently, many countries are working hard to research and improve it, and make it one of the standing weapons. Missiles are the result of the rapid progress of radio, reaction jet propulsion (especially rockets), and high-speed flight and other scientific and technological advancements in the past dozen years. It can also be said that it is mainly the crystallization of the development of these three sciences.
    As a weapon, missiles have many different types, among which the more important ones are: anti-aircraft (surface-to-air), air combat attack (air-to-air), aerial bombing (air-to-surface), and ground-launched long-range bombing (surface-to-surface) and other types ("surface" refers to ground or water surface).
    In addition to military use, missiles can also be used for high-altitude scientific research and artificial satellites, serving the peaceful construction cause of mankind.
    Generally speaking, any missile is composed of three main systems: a power device, structural parts (such as wings, fuselage, tail, etc.), and an automatic control mechanism. In addition, depending on the nature of the missile, its useful payload can be an explosive warhead made up of explosives and a fuse, or instrumentation equipment for scientific research.
    The power device of a missile is a jet engine, and there are currently three different types: rocket, ramjet, and turbojet. Among them, rocket is the most widely used, followed by ramjet, and turbojet is the least used. Since most missiles use rocket jet engines, and the entire missile is almost completely filled with rockets, some people sometimes call this type of missile (such as long-range ballistic intercontinental missiles) a rocket weapon. In fact, they often refer to the same thing.
    Liquid fuel rockets are most widely used because of their long working time, large thrust, and ability to fly at high altitudes, making them most suitable for large missiles. Solid fuel rockets are widely used because of their short working time, suitable for short-range rapid-fire, such as air combat missiles. Ramjet engines have a simple structure and are suitable for high-speed (2-4 times the speed of sound) missiles. At the same time, because they use air for combustion, they do not need to carry an oxidant, so the fuel consumption per unit thrust per second is much less than that of rockets. However, because they use air, the altitude is not high, about 20,000 meters. And because it has the serious disadvantage of not being able to generate thrust when stationary, it needs other power devices to help it take off, so its application is limited. As for the turbojet engine commonly used in general jet aircraft, it is only suitable for missiles with lower speeds (sonic range), such as unmanned bombing missiles.
    Since most missiles fly at supersonic speeds and must operate very flexibly, the wings and tails are mostly cross-shaped, and sometimes triangular or rectangular with short wingspans are used. Because these shapes generate less resistance during flight, they can obtain a certain degree of stability and maneuverability in the atmosphere, which is more conducive to high-speed flight.
    One of the most important components of a missile is its automatic control system. This is also the most complex and characteristic part of it. At present, this automatic control system has not yet reached a very perfect state and still needs further research.
    The development of automatic control systems in missiles has been promoted by the tremendous advances in radio remote control and radar science and technology in the past dozen years.
    Automatic control systems come in many varieties, depending on the missile's mission, flight time, and operational intent. But they include two basic types. One is for dealing with rapidly moving targets in the air, such as enemy bombers; the other is for dealing with stationary or slowly moving targets on the surface, such as munitions factories on the ground or warships on the sea.
    The automatic control system for dealing with aerial targets should, in principle, obtain the following information: the current location of the target, the location the target is about to reach, the location of the missile itself, and a coordinate system used as a reference. After this information enters the electronic computer, it can be determined how the missile's flight path should be corrected. The correction signal is transmitted by radio waves, and through the autopilot and power control system in the missile, it is converted into appropriate control forces, so that the missile changes its orientation according to the controller's "command" and accurately flies to the target.
    In the final stage of the missile flying to the target, an "automatic sight" can also be used. Although its effective range is not large, it is accurate and reliable. One type uses the energy emitted from the target, such as infrared rays or noise emitted by the engine on an enemy aircraft, to make the missile automatically aim.
    The automatic control system for dealing with ground targets is different from the one mentioned above. This system needs to compare the missile's flight path with the predetermined flight path, and make detailed corrections throughout the power flight time. Except for short-range ones, the control equipment is installed in the missile. For accurate flight over long distances, such as several thousand kilometers, a telescope can also be installed on the missile to use the light of the sun, moon, or a certain star to determine the direction of navigation, and fly to the predetermined target through the action of the autopilot system in the missile.
    These different types of missiles work using automatic control systems. For example, anti-aircraft missiles (surface-to-air) can fly out from the launch pad on the ground when an enemy aircraft is approaching, and then fly along the narrow radio beam that the radar shoots at the target, and destroy it.
    Modern scientific and technologically advanced countries possess all kinds of missile weapons. Some ballistic intercontinental missiles are as long as ten to tens of meters, weigh ten to tens of tons, and can fly at supersonic speeds for several thousand or even tens of thousands of kilometers. This type of missile can also be equipped with a nuclear warhead. On the other hand, some missiles are very small, for example, air combat missiles, some are only one or two meters long, and weigh only a few kilograms. The length of general missiles is about three meters to eight meters, weighing from hundreds of kilograms to tons.
    Judging from the technical level achieved by missiles, they have become a powerful and effective weapon, which can be used for attack or defense. As one of the most scientifically and technologically advanced countries in the world, the Soviet Union has achieved great achievements in this area and is still developing rapidly; even the imperialist countries have to admit this. From this, it can be seen that the anti-aggression warnings made by Comrade Khrushchev and Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov to the imperialist countries on various occasions have a completely solid material foundation.

    火箭和导弹
    北京航空学院副教授　史超礼
    火箭和导弹的发展有着密切的联系。火箭是喷气发动机中的一种。而导弹却是一种依靠喷气发动机的动力来飞行的、不载人的航空器。
    火箭喷气式发动机具有液体燃料和固体燃料两种不同的型式。早期的火箭是固体燃料式的。唐朝初年我国炼丹家首先发明了火药。据宋史记载，北宋真宗咸平三年（公元1，000年），唐福向朝庭进献了火箭等火药式武器。后来这种武器曾在宋、金、元三国战争中得到了应用。
    约在十三世纪，我国发明的火箭传入阿拉伯国家，再经阿拉伯人之手传到欧洲。二十世纪以来，近代科学得到巨大的发展。火箭也由固体燃料式进一步发展为液体燃料式。苏联的伟大学者乔尔可夫斯基在这方面贡献很大。他曾提出用酒精，汽油等作燃料，用液体氧作氧化剂的方案，并于1903年发表了“用火箭工具探测宇宙”的著名论文，奠定了宇宙航行的理论基础。嗣后，法国、美国和德国的学者们也作了不少的研究。
    作为一种产生反作用推力的动力装置，火箭的最大优点是，它不但能在空气极为稀薄的高空中飞行，而且还能在真空中飞行。因为它本身不但携有燃料，同时还携有助燃的氧化剂。依靠二者在燃烧室中混合燃烧，由喷管向后喷出，产生反作用推力，就可在空间前进。氧化剂和燃料合称为推进剂。所谓液体燃料式火箭，即其推进剂为液体；同理，推进剂是固体的就叫做固体燃料式火箭。
    在军事方面：要求火箭在每秒内消耗的推进剂要少，而产生的推力要大。第二次世界大战末期出现的液体燃料火箭的推力有25.5吨，如今早已超过这个数值了。
    十余年来试验过的液体推进剂约在千种以上，然而良好的氧化剂也许还不超过十种。其中常用的有液体氧、硝酸和过氧化氢等。合用的燃料却很多，如酒精、汽油、肼、液体氢之类。液体火箭最主要的构件是燃烧室和喷管。由于燃烧温度高达摄氏二、三千度，科学家们正在为很好地解决燃烧室的热传导问题而努力。近来已有几种新的冷却方法获得很大的成功。
    固体燃料火箭的推进剂在从前常用黑色火药。目前则多用硝化纤维和硝化甘油以及少量附加物的混合固体。这种固体推进剂通常制成条状，叫做元条。元条形状的设计很关重要，因为它和燃烧的时间以及推力、点火都有密切的关系。
    两种火箭各有其特点。液体燃料火箭每秒内消耗每公斤推进剂所产生的推力大，也可以多带推进剂，延长工作的时间到几十分钟。固体燃料火箭的构造很简单，使用较方便，但是固体推进剂必须装在火箭本身的燃烧室里面，所以不能多装，因而工作时间极短，只有几秒或几十秒钟。目前它们都广泛地使用于不同类型的导弹上。
    此外，还在研究一种光子火箭。光子火箭的工作原理是依靠光粒子（即光子）流的喷射来产生反作用推力。照理论上讲，这种火箭可得到接近于光速的巨大速度。不过它现在距实用阶段还很远。
    导弹，是一种依靠喷气发动机的动力而前进的不载人的航空器；它依靠一定的动力，通过某种机构从远处控制，能够按控制者的意志飞向预定的目标。由于它是在战争中发展起来的并且最先用在攻击性的武器上，所以叫做导弹。
    导弹最初出现于第二次世界大战中。那就是德国使用的V—1和V—2。战后这种导弹武器得到更进一步的发展。目前很多国家都在努力从事研究改进，并且使它成为常备的武器之一。导弹是最近十几年来，无线电、反作用喷气推进（特别是火箭）和高速飞行等科学技术飞跃进步的结果。也可以说，主要是这三门科学发展的结晶。
    作为武器，导弹具有多种不同的类型，其中比较重要的有：防空用的（表面对空中），空战攻击用的（空中对空中），空中轰炸用的（空中对表面），和地面发射远程轰炸用的（表面对表面）等几种（“表面”指地面或水面）。
    除了军用外，导弹还可以作高空科学研究和人造卫星，为人类的和平建设事业服务。
    任何一种导弹，一般说来，都是由动力装置、结构部分（如机翼、机身、尾翼等）、和自动控制机构等三个主要系统构成的。此外，按导弹性质的不同，它的有用载荷可以是由炸药和引信合成的爆炸头，或者是作科学研究用的仪器设备。
    导弹的动力装置是喷气式发动机，目前有火箭式、冲压式和涡轮喷气式三种不同的类型。其中火箭式使用最广泛，冲压式次之，涡轮式应用最少。由于大多数导弹使用火箭式喷气发动机，而整个导弹几乎完全给火箭占满，所以有时有人管这种导弹（例如远程弹道式洲际导弹）叫火箭式武器。实际上往往指的是同一个东西。
    液体燃料火箭由于工作时间较长，推力较大，且能在高空飞行，最适用于大型导弹，所以使用最广。固体燃料火箭由于工作时间短，适用于短程速射，如空战用的导弹，它的使用也颇广泛。冲压式喷气发动机的构造简单，适用于高速（音速的2—4倍）导弹，同时因为它利用空气进行燃烧，就不需要带氧化剂，所以每单位推力每秒所耗的燃料比火箭所耗推进剂要少得多。但也就因为利用空气，所以高度不高，约在两万公尺左右。并且由于它具有静止时不能产生推力的严重缺点，需要其他动力装置帮助它起飞，因此它的应用受到限制。至于一般喷气飞机上常用的涡轮喷气式发动机仅适用于速度较低（音速范围）的导弹，如无人驾驶的轰炸导弹之类。
    由于导弹绝大多数都是以超音速飞行的，而且要运转非常灵活，所以机翼和尾翼多采用十字形，有时也采用三角形或翼展较短的长方形。因为采用这些形状，在飞行时，产生的阻力小，在大气中飞行能获得一定的稳定性和机动性，对于高速飞行比较有利。
    导弹最主要的构成部分之一是它的自动控制系统。这也是它最复杂、最具有特色的一部分。在目前这种自动控制系统还未能达到十分完善的地步，还必须作进一步的研究。
    导弹中自动控制系统的发展，是最近十几年来在无线电远距离控制和雷达科学技术方面的巨大进展所促成的。
    自动控制系统随着导弹的任务，飞行时间和操作意图的不同而有许多种类。但包括两种基本不同的类型。一种是对付空中迅速移动着的目标的，如敌方轰炸机；另一种是对付表面上静止或移动缓慢的目标的，如地面上的军火工厂或海面上的军舰等。
    对付空中目标的自动控制系统，在原则上应获悉下列情报：目标目前所在的位置，目标即将到达的位置，导弹本身所在的位置，以及某种用作参考基准的座标系统。这些情报进入电子计算机以后，就可确定导弹飞行路线应作如何的修正。修正的讯号由无线电波发射出去，通过导弹中自动驾驶仪和动力控制系统，转为适当的操纵力量，使导弹按照控制者的“命令”，改变方位，准确地飞向目标。
    在导弹飞向目标的最后阶段、还可使用“自动瞄准器”。它的有效范围虽然不大，但精确可靠。其中一类是利用目标中发出来的能量，如敌机上发动机发出的红外线或噪音，来使导弹自动地进行瞄准的。
    对付地面目标的自动控制系统和上面说的不同。这种系统需要把导弹的飞行路线和预定的飞行路线作比较，并且在整个动力飞行时间内经常地予以细致的校正。除短程者外，控制设备都装在导弹中。为了远距离，比如几千公里的准确飞行，还可在导弹上安装望远镜，利用太阳、月亮或某一星球的光亮来确定航行的方向，通过导弹中的自动驾驶仪系统的作用，向预定的目标飞行。
    这些不同类型的导弹都是采取自动控制系统来工作的。例如防空用的导弹（表面对空中），在敌机临近时，可由地面的发射架上飞出去，然后沿着雷达射到目标上的狭小的无线电波束，飞向目标，把它炸毁。
    现代各科学先进国家拥有各式导弹武器。有的弹道式洲际导弹，长达十几到几十公尺，重达十几到几十吨，能以超音速飞行好几千甚至上万公里。这种导弹还可安装核子武器的爆炸头。另方面，有的导弹又很小，例如空战用的导弹，有的只有一、二公尺长，重量也只有几公斤。一般导弹的长度约三公尺至八公尺，重几百公斤到几吨。
    由导弹所达到的技术水平看，它已成为一种威力强大、有效的武器，可以作攻击用，也可作防御用。作为世界上科学技术最发达的国家之一，苏联在这方面已获得巨大的成就，并且还在迅速地发展着；这点甚至帝国主义国家都不得不承认。由此可知，赫鲁晓夫同志和苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅，历次向帝国主义国家所作的反侵略的警告，是有完全坚实的物质基础的。
