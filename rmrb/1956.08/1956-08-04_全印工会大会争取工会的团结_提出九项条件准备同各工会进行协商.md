Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 2nd – The General Council of the All-India Trade Union Congress, at a meeting held in Calcutta, passed a resolution reiterating its call for unity among all trade unions and appointing a seven-member committee to consult with other trade union organizations.

The General Council meeting lasted three days and closed on July 30th. The meeting laid down nine major conditions for achieving trade union unity and instructed the seven-member committee to conduct consultations with various trade unions based on these conditions.

The nine conditions stipulated in the resolution include: unconditional acceptance and respect for the democratic functions of trade unions; appropriate representation of various ideologies in the leadership structure of joint organizations; freedom from interference by the government, employers, or political parties; the final decision-making power for all important decisions—including collective contracts—rests with the general organization; recognition of every worker's right to participate in any political party; acceptance of strikes as a last resort; and the establishment of only one trade union in a factory.

In another resolution, the General Council of the All-India Trade Union Congress called on all trade union organizations to establish special consultation committees to strive for an immediate 25% increase in wages. The resolution demanded that the government stipulate a national minimum wage of one hundred rupees and appoint a wage committee to carry out this task. The resolution also demanded guarantees that the living standards of workers be gradually improved and that they be able to obtain a fair share of the profits resulting from increased productivity.

The General Council also criticized certain provisions of the Savings Fund Act and the Labor Disputes Act, calling on workers to hold a "Labor Relations Day" to demand the elimination of the defects in these laws.

    全印工会大会争取工会的团结
    提出九项条件准备同各工会进行协商
    新华社新德里2日电　全印工会大会总理事会在加尔各答举行的会议通过决议，再次呼吁各工会团结一致，并且任命一个七人委员会同其他工会组织进行协商。
    总理事会会议共举行三天，在七月三十日闭幕。这次会议订出了实现工会团结的九项主要条件，并且指示七人委员会根据这些条件来同各工会进行协商。
    决议规定的九项条件包括：毫无保留地接受和尊重工会的民主职能；在共同组织的领导机构中各种观念形态都有适当的代表权；不受政府、雇主或政党的干涉；对一切重要决定——包括集体合同——的最后决定权属于总机构；承认每个工人有权参加任何政党；接受以罢工作为最后手段；在一个工厂只成立一个工会。
    全印工会大会总理事会在另一项决议中呼吁所有工会组织成立特别协商委员会，以争取立即增加工资25％。决议要求政府规定全国最低限度工资为一百卢比，并且任命一个工资委员会来进行这项工作。这项决议还要求保证使工人们的生活水平逐步提高，并且使他们能够在生产力提高而带来的利润中取得公平的一份。
    总理事会还批评了节约储蓄基金法和劳资纠纷法中的某些规定，它号召工人们举行“劳资关系日”来要求消除这些法律的缺陷。
