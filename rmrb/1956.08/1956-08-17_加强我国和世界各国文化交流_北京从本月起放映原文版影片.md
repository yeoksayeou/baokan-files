In order to strengthen cultural exchange between China and other countries, Beijing will begin screening original language films this month. The China Youth Art Theater and the Soviet Exhibition Center Cinema will screen new original language films weekly beginning this month. The films to be shown in August include seven films such as the Soviet film "On the Stage," the French film "Malan Flower, Fang Fang," the Czechoslovak film "Prehistoric Adventure," and the West German film "Heart of the World."

The purpose of screening original language films is to strengthen cultural exchange between the people of our country and the people of the world. It is also to meet the needs of some audiences. Many university professors, students, and staff members hope to learn foreign languages through original language films and better understand the lives of people in various countries. Literary and art workers hope to learn from film artists from various countries through original language films. Foreign embassy staff, Soviet and people's democratic countries' experts, and foreign guests visiting Beijing also hope to see original language films from their own countries and other countries.

The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation has prepared more than 40 original language film copies from more than ten countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, France, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Spain, and India, for audiences. Many of them are based on world-famous works, such as Shakespeare's "Othello," "Twelfth Night" (both Soviet films), "Hamlet" (British film), and Dickens' "The Pickwick Papers" (British film). It is reported that ten major cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Urumqi, and Shenyang, will begin screening original language films before the end of this year.
