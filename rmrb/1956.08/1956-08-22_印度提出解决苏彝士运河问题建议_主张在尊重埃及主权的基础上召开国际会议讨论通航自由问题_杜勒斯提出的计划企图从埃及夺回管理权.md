Xinhua News Agency, London, August 21st. The attempt by Britain and France to forcibly pass a resolution endorsing the international control plan for the Suez Canal has met with strong opposition both inside and outside the Suez issue conference.

	Indian representative Menon, in his first speech at the conference on August 20th, said that any solution could not be imposed on others but could only be reached through consultation. He believed that Egypt would find it impossible to accept international control of the canal. He also believed that although the canal has been recognized as Egyptian, it has an international nature. The question now is to find a way to link the international users' interest group with the new Egyptian company, and this should be determined through consultation.

	He said that the interests of users must be guaranteed through consultation, and this should be possible through the cooperation of the Egyptian government and with its help. Egypt will not abolish the nationalization of the company. Therefore, a way must be found to make the Egyptian government a participant in a solemn agreement.

	Menon emphasized that a peaceful solution must be sought, because any other solution is truly terrible, and therefore the conference must adopt a conciliatory attitude and not issue commands.

	Menon said that international management is impossible and cannot be forcibly implemented. Menon put forward a draft proposal considered to be the basis for a peaceful solution. The content of this proposal is:

	“Principles:

	“One – Recognition of Egyptian sovereignty.

	“Two – Recognition that the canal is an indivisible part of Egypt and also a waterway of international importance.

	“Three – Freedom of navigation for all countries, without hindrance, in accordance with the Constantinople Convention of 1888.

	“Four – Tolls should be fair and equal. Canal facilities should be open to all countries without discrimination.

	“Five – The canal should be maintained in normal condition at all times and maintained in accordance with modern technical requirements for navigation.

	“Six – The interests of canal users should be duly recognized.

	"Recognizing that it is urgently needed to find peaceful and rapid solutions to the situation of the canal based on these principles and the UN Charter, and to immediately open the way for negotiations based on these recommendations:

	"Noting that Egypt, even as recently as July 21, 1956, declared its determination to fulfill all its international obligations and the guarantees of the 1888 Convention and the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement relating to this Convention, the following proposals are put forward, believing that they will provide a basis for negotiations aimed at seeking a peaceful solution:

	“Recommendations:

	“One: Revise the Constantinople Convention of 1888 in order to reaffirm its principles and make some necessary amendments for today, especially the amendments to the company clauses relating to fair and equal tolls and charges and canal maintenance as stipulated in the above-mentioned items four and five.

	“Two: Consider taking all steps, including a conference attended by representatives of the signatory countries of the 1888 Convention and representatives of all users and user countries of the canal, to discuss the above-mentioned first proposal.

	“Three: Consider combining the interests of international users and the interests of the Egyptian Suez Canal Company without prejudice to Egyptian ownership and operation.

	“Four: Establish a consultative body representing the interests of users with the responsibilities of consultation, negotiation and liaison, based on regional representation and interests.

	“Five: The Egyptian government shall submit an annual report of the Egyptian Suez Canal Company to the United Nations.”

	The Indian proposal was put forward after consultation with many representatives outside the meeting and is fairly consistent with the speeches of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Indonesia and Ceylon. However, it is very different from another proposal put forward by the US representative at the meeting on August 20th.

	Although US Secretary of State Dulles' plan verbally recognizes Egypt's sovereignty over the canal, its purpose is to seize the management of the canal from the Egyptian government through the Suez Canal Commission that it proposes to establish. It insists: “The management, maintenance and development of the canal, as well as its expansion to increase shipping volume to benefit world trade and Egypt, will be the responsibility of the Suez Canal Commission. Egypt will grant this commission all the rights and facilities necessary to carry out the above tasks.

	Dulles carefully removed the word “international” that was originally to be added to this committee. However, he still insists: “The members of the committee, in addition to Egypt, will also include other countries selected from the member countries of the convention in a manner unanimously agreed upon with due consideration of usage, trade conditions and geographical location; The composition of the committee shall be such as to ensure that it performs its duties only for the best possible operational results, without political motives that favor or are prejudiced against canal users." In addition, Dulles also requested "the establishment of an arbitration commission to resolve any disputes regarding fair compensation to Egypt or fair compensation to the Suez Canal International Company, or other issues arising from the operation of the canal."

	Dulles knew that this proposal would definitely be rejected by Egypt, so he suggested, "We should not base our opinions on speculation as to whether the Egyptian government will agree."

	As previously reported, the United States, Britain, and France intend to force the conference to pass their proposals by a majority vote, but frequent activities outside the conference over the weekend proved that their efforts to this end were unsuccessful. It is believed that Dulles' proposals and speeches were revised at the last minute, which caused the opening of the August 20th meeting to be delayed by nearly an hour.

	Before putting forward his proposal, Dulles said that this meeting was not a meeting to make decisions that were binding on those who did not agree. This meeting is also not a meeting to issue any kind of ultimatum to Egypt. He said that it may not be possible to reach complete agreement on his plan, but he hoped to obtain the maximum possible agreement. He said that if there are different views, these different views should also be explained and told to Egypt.

	All of this shows that the initiators of the conference, in view of the difficulty in forcing through a binding resolution, are seeking to quickly end the conference and obtain as much support as possible so that they can be in a relatively strong position when dealing with Egypt after the conference, although this resolution will not have any force if it does not receive the agreement of important countries such as the Soviet Union, India, and Indonesia.

### 印度提出解决苏彝士运河问题建议  主张在尊重埃及主权的基础上召开国际会议讨论通航自由问题  杜勒斯提出的计划企图从埃及夺回管理权

    印度提出解决苏彝士运河问题建议
    主张在尊重埃及主权的基础上召开国际会议讨论通航自由问题
    杜勒斯提出的计划企图从埃及夺回管理权
    新华社伦敦21日电　英法要强行通过赞成对苏彝士运河实行国际管制计划的决议的打算，在苏彝士问题会议内外都遭到了强烈的反对。
    印度代表梅农八月二十日在会议上第一次发表演说，他说任何解决办法都不能强加在别人身上而只能通过协商得出。他认为埃及将认为不可能接受由国际机构管制运河。他也认为，虽然运河已被承认是埃及的，但是它具有国际的性质。现在的问题是要找出如何使国际使用者利益集团同新的埃及公司联系的方法，而这应当通过协商来确定。
    他说，使用者的利益一定得设法通过协商来加以保证，而通过埃及政府的合作和在埃及政府的帮助下是应当可能做到这一点的。埃及不会取消这个公司的国有化。因此必须设法使埃及政府成为庄严协议的一个参加者。
    梅农强调说，一定要求得和平解决的办法，因为除此以外别的办法的确是很可怕的，因此，会议一定要采取和解态度而不要发号施令。
    梅农说，国际管理是不可能的，而且也是不能强迫实行的。梅农提出了被认为是和平解决办法的基础的建议草案。这个建议的内容是：
    “原则：
    “一——承认埃及的主权。
    “二——承认这条运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分，也是具有国际重要意义的一条水道。
    “三——遵照1888年君士坦丁堡公约，对一切国家实行自由、不受阻挠的通航。
    “四——通行税收费应该公正和平等。运河的设施应该没有歧视地对一切国家开放。
    “五——运河应予保养使它不论在何时都处于正常状态中，并且依照有关航行的现代技术要求予以保养。
    “六——运河使用者的利益应当得到应有的承认。
    “认识到，这样做是迫切需要的：必须找到根据这些原则和联合国宪章和平而迅速地解决有关运河的局势的办法并且必须立即根据这些建议为谈判开辟道路：
    “注意到，埃及甚至近在1956年7月21日还宣布埃及决心履行它的一切国际义务和1888年的公约与1954年的英埃协定中有关这个公约的保证，兹提出下面的建议，相信它们将为谋求和平解决的谈判提供基础：
    “建议：
    “一、修改1888年的君士坦丁堡公约，以便重新肯定它的原则和作出一些今天所必要的修正，特别是有关上述第四项和第五项所规定的公正和平等的通行税和收费与运河保养方面的公司条款的修正。
    “二、考虑采取一切步骤，包括有1888年公约签字国代表和运河的所有使用者和使用国代表参加的会议，来讨论上述第一条建议。
    “三、在不损害埃及的所有权和经营的情况下考虑把国际使用者的利益和埃及苏彝士运河公司的利益结合起来。
    “四、根据地区代表权和利益成立一个负有咨询、协商和联络的职责的代表使用者利益的协商机构。
    “五、埃及政府向联合国递交埃及苏彝士运河公司的年度报告。”
    印度的建议是在会场外同许多代表商量后提出的，它同苏联、印度尼西亚和锡兰代表的发言是相当一致的。但是，它同美国代表在八月二十日会议上提出的另外一个建议有很大不同。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯提出的计划虽然在口头上承认埃及拥有对运河的主权，但是它的目的是要通过它所建议成立的苏彝士运河委员会把运河的管理权从埃及政府手中夺取过来。它坚持：“管理、保养和发展运河以及把它扩大以增加航运量以利于世界贸易和埃及的工作，将是苏彝士运河委员会的责任。埃及将给予这个委员会为执行上述任务而需要的一切权利和便利。
    杜勒斯小心地取消了原定要加在这个委员会之上的国际字样。然而他仍然坚持：“委员会的成员，除了埃及之外，还有在适当地考虑到使用、贸易状况和地理位置的情况下一致同意的方式从公约成员国中选出的其他国家；委员会的成份要能够保证，它履行它的职责只是为了获致最好不过的经营效果，不怀有赞同运河使用者或对它们抱有偏见的政治动机。”此外，杜勒斯还要求“成立一个仲裁委员会以解决关于给予埃及公平报酬或给予苏彝士运河国际公司公正赔偿或者由于运河的经营而引起的其他问题的任何争端。”
    杜勒斯知道这种建议一定会遭到埃及的拒绝，因此他建议，“我们表示意见不应该以埃及政府是不是将会同意的猜测为根据。”
    前已报道，美、英、法三国打算强使会议以多数票通过他们的建议，但是上周周末在会外进行的频繁活动证明，他们为了这个目的而进行的努力是不顺利的，人们认为，杜勒斯的建议和演说在最后一分钟进行了修改，这是使八月二十日的会议的开幕拖延将近一小时的原因。
    杜勒斯在提出他的建议以前说，这次会议并不是作出对那些并不同意的国家具有约束力的决定的会议。这次会议也不是通过它来对埃及提出任何性质的最后通牒的会议。他说，也许不可能对他的方案取得完全一致的意见，但是他希望能获得在可能范围内最大限度的一致。他说，如果有不同的看法，这些不同的看法也应该说明，并且告诉埃及。
    这一切可以说明，会议的发起国鉴于难于强行通过某种具有约束力的决议，正在设法迅速结束会议，取得尽可能多的支持，以便它们在会后同埃及打交道时可以处于比较有力的地位，虽然这种决议如果得不到像苏联、印度、印度尼西亚这样重要的国家的同意是不会有什么力量的。
