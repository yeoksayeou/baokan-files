    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. The German News Agency published a communiqué from the Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic. The communiqué warns the West German authorities against banning the German Communist Party.
    The communiqué states that the West German Constitutional Court, at the request of the Bonn government, intends to ban the German Communist Party. At this last moment, we issue a warning: Do not take such fatal actions that can only be understood as an open attack on the cause of German unification. Banning the German Communist Party will seriously hinder any negotiations in preparation for a unified Germany. The communiqué also points out that banning the Communist Party means moving towards the abolition of fundamental democratic freedoms. The German people will never recognize such arbitrary acts. The Bonn government's brutal measures against this party, which has been steadfastly fighting to safeguard democratic freedoms, show all the German people that the current Bonn government is pushing Germany onto the fatal path of militarization. The German people must not allow this to happen.

    民主德国总理新闻处发表公报
    警告西德当局不要迫害德共
    新华社柏林16日电　德意志通讯社发表了德意志民主共和国总理新闻处的公报，这个公报警告西德当局不能禁止德国共产党。
    公报说，西德宪法法院根据波恩政府的要求，打算禁止德国共产党。我们在这最后的一刻提出警告：不要采取这一类只可能被理解为公开打击德国统一事业的致命行动。禁止德国共产党将会使得任何为统一德国作准备的谈判遭到严重困难。公报还指出，禁止共产党意味着走向取消基本民主自由。德国人民什么时候也不会承认这一类专横行为。波恩政府针对着这个一直在坚定地为保障民主自由而斗争的党而采取的残暴措施，向全体德国人民表明了目前的波恩政府正在把德国推上军国主义化的致命的道路。德国人民不应当允许这种情况发生。
