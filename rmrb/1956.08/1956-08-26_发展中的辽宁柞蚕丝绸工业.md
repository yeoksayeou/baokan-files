	Developing Liaoning's Tussah Silk Industry
	Ru Zhi
	Tussah silk is one of China's main special products. Liaoning Province is the main production area of ​​tussah silk in China, and its output accounts for about 70% of the country's tussah silk production. In the past few years, Liaoning's tussah silk industry has seen rapid recovery and development. The output of tussah silk in 1955 was twelve times that of 1949, and the output of tussah silk fabric in 1955 was six times that of 1949. There are now nine silk reeling factories, six silk fabric factories, silk joint factories, bleaching factories, etc. The number of employees has also increased three times compared to 1949. 80% of the produced tussah silk is exported to countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, Britain, Sweden, Italy, Japan, and India.
	Although the output of tussah silk has increased a lot in recent years, it is still far from meeting the needs of domestic and foreign markets. Therefore, this year, many tussah silk factories in Liaoning Province have carried out a large amount of capital construction. A total of 3,246 silk reeling machines and 286 silk weaving machines will be added. Now, except for the Xinsheng Silk Reeling Factory in Haicheng, the construction of other factories has been completed and put into production before May. More than 5,000 newly employed workers have embarked on the production posts of the silk industry. After these expanded and newly restored factories are put into production, they can increase the annual output by 236 tons of tussah silk and 2.6 million meters of tussah silk fabric. With the increase in efficiency and the addition of shifts, this year's tussah silk production will increase by 88% compared with last year, and tussah silk fabric production can increase by 47% compared with last year. The investment in these expanded and newly restored factories can be fully recovered in only half a year.
	In addition, three large-scale new factories are currently being designed and prepared for construction and expansion. Among them, the Fengcheng Silk Joint Factory and the expanded Wulongbei Spun Silk Factory will start large-scale construction at the end of the third quarter of this year, and the main buildings can be completed by the end of the year. The Anshan No. 2 Spun Silk Factory, which will start construction next year, will also be a large-scale spinning, weaving, and dyeing joint factory with 20,000 fine spinning spindles and 250 silk weaving machines. The above three factories will all adopt the world's latest equipment, and will be the largest silk joint factories in China after completion. These factories can produce jacquard silks and high-grade silk materials for various purposes, and fundamentally solve the problems of dull colors and large shrinkage rates. These factories can recover all investments within one year after being put into production.

    发展中的辽宁柞蚕丝绸工业
    如芝
    柞蚕丝绸是我国主要特产之一。辽宁省是我国柞蚕丝绸的主要产地，它的产量要占全国柞蚕丝绸产量的70％左右。几年来辽宁柞蚕丝绸工业有了很快的恢复和发展，1955年柞蚕丝产量为1949年的十二倍，1955年柞蚕绸的产量为1949年的六倍。现有缫丝厂九座，绸厂和丝绸联合厂、漂炼厂等六座。职工也较1949年增加了三倍。生产的柞蚕丝绸80％是出口运到苏联、波兰、民主德国、英国、瑞典、意大利、日本、印度等国的。
    虽然这几年来柞蚕丝绸产量增加得很多，但还是远不能满足国内外市场的需要。因此今年辽宁省许多柞蚕丝绸工厂进行了大量的基本建设。总共将增加缫丝机三千二百四十六台、织绸机二百八十六台。现在除海城的新生缫丝厂以外，其它各厂的建设工程都在五月份以前先后竣工，投入生产，有五千多名新就业的职工踏上了丝绸工业的生产岗位。这些扩建和新恢复的工厂投入生产后，每年可增产二百三十六吨柞蚕丝和二百六十万公尺柞蚕绸。加上提高效率和增加班次，今年的柞蚕丝产量将比去年提高88％，柞蚕绸产量可以比去年增加47％。这些扩建和新恢复工厂的投资，只需半年时间就可以全部收回。
    此外，今年正在设计和筹备新建和扩建三个规模较大的新工厂。其中凤城丝绸联合厂和扩建的五龙背绢纺厂，将在今年三季度末大兴土木，年底就可以完成主要建筑。将在明年动工的鞍山第二绢纺厂，也将是一个设有二万枚精纺锭、二百五十台织绸机的大型纺、织、染联合工厂。上述三个工厂都将采用世界最新的设备，建成后都是我国规模最大的丝绸联合工厂。这些工厂可以生产各种用途的提花绸和高级绸料，并根本上解决色不鲜、缩率大的问题。这些工厂投入生产后一年就可将全部投资收回。
