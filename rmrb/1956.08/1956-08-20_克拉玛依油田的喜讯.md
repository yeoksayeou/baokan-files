Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 18th: Abundant water needed for production and life in the Karamay oil area will be drawn from the Manas River in Xinjiang. Currently, a water conservancy survey team is measuring along the route of the more than 40-kilometer-long water diversion pipeline. The full-scale construction of this water diversion pipeline project will begin in early September. It is expected that before the winter freeze, the water from the Manas River will flow into the Karamay oil area through seamless steel pipes.

The development work in the Karamay oil area is progressing rapidly, and the number of employees and their families in the oil area is also increasing rapidly. The water volume of the Baogulun River, which was originally an important water source for the oil area, cannot meet the water needs of the oil area. The Manas River has an annual river flow of 1.2 billion cubic meters, with a maximum of 1.6 billion cubic meters, which can completely solve the water problem in the oil area. At present, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau has sent a large number of responsible cadres to the construction site to guide the pipeline construction work. Yumen Oil Mine has also decided to send a group of technicians to support the pipeline construction project.

Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 18th: (Xinhua Reporter Yi Xiao reports) The lives of the workers in the Karamay exploration area are improving day by day.

Although the objective environment here is very difficult, the Party Committee and the leadership of the Oilfield Exploration Department are doing everything possible to make the workers' lives better. On the Gobi Desert, the water supply is the most difficult, but the Party and government leaders of the exploration area have insisted on the principle that it is better to have the drilling rig stop working due to lack of water than to let the workers go thirsty. The leaders of the exploration area extracted a certain number of cars to transport sweet water from 40 kilometers away. Now, the workers have universally access to boiled water, and can wash their faces and clothes.

The workers' meals have also been improved. In the newly built canteens for ethnic minorities, Han people, and Soviet experts, fresh vegetables such as eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, and cabbage can be eaten at every meal; ethnic minority workers can also often eat beef and mutton and their favorite roasted naan.

Now, Karamay has become a prosperous small town. Trading companies, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Bank of China, and post and telecommunications bureaus have all set up business offices here. Workers can buy cloth, general merchandise, books and periodicals in Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian languages, as well as valuable fruits such as Turpan grapes, Yili apples, Hami melons, and refreshing drinks such as Tianshan soda. What makes the workers especially happy is that the postal car that comes every other day brings them bundles of letters from relatives in distant places.

The exploration area's trade union has also invited barbershops, sewing groups, shoe repair groups, and laundry rooms, so that workers will no longer have to wear long hair and shoes with exposed heels. A very deep impression the reporter got in Karamay was that everyone was dressed very neatly during their spare time. The sewing group is very busy every day, accepting orders for new-style clothing such as dresses and calico shirts from the girls.

Living conditions are also improving. Now, most workers still live in tents, yurts, wooden houses, and dugouts, but new houses are being built one after another, and a group of workers have already moved into new homes. There are also cultural and health facilities such as radio stations, cultural study classes, libraries, and hospitals, and the hospital has equipment such as X-rays. Cultural and recreational life is also very active. Various teams have been formed. The trade union also shows movies and holds dance evenings every weekend.

    克拉玛依油田的喜讯
    从玛纳斯河将引来丰足的水
    新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　克拉玛依油区生产和生活所需要的水，将从新疆玛纳斯河引来。现在，一支水利勘测队正在四十多公里长的引水管道沿线测量。九月初，这个引水管道工程就要全面施工。预计在冬季冰封之前，玛纳斯河的水就可以顺着无缝钢管的管道，流入克拉玛依油区。
    克拉玛依油区的开发工作进展很快，油区的职工和家属也正在迅速增加，原先作为油区重要水源的包古伦河水量不能满足油区用水的需要。玛纳斯河全年河水流量有十二亿立方公尺，最高达十六亿立方公尺，可以使油区的用水问题得到彻底解决。目前，新疆石油工业管理局已经派出大批负责干部，到工地指导管线修建工作。玉门油矿也决定派一批技术人员，前来支援管线的修建工程。
    生活正在改善着
    新华社克拉玛依18日电　新华社记者伊晓报道：克拉玛依探区职工的生活正在日益改善着。
    这里虽然客观环境很困难，但是这里的中共党委同油田钻探处的领导方面，还是想尽办法使职工生活得好一些。在戈壁滩上，水的供应是最困难的，但是探区党政领导方面坚持了宁可使钻机没有工程用水停工，也不能让工人渴着的原则。探区领导方面抽出一定数量的汽车从四十公里以外运来甜水。现在，职工都普遍喝到了开水，而且可以洗脸洗衣服了。
    职工的饭食也有了改进。在新建的少数民族的、汉族的和苏联专家的几个食堂里，每顿饭都可以吃到茄子、蕃茄、洋芋、豆角、洋白菜等新鲜蔬菜；少数民族的职工，还可以经常吃到牛羊肉和他们最喜欢吃的烤饷。
    现在，克拉玛依已经成了一个繁荣的小市镇。贸易公司、新华书店、人民银行和邮电局，都在这里设立了营业机构。职工们可以买到布匹、百货、汉、维、哈、俄各种文字的书籍报刊，以及吐鲁番葡萄、伊犁苹果、哈密瓜等名贵的水果和天山汽水等清凉饮料。特别使工人们高兴的，是隔一天来一次的邮车给他们带来了成捆的远方亲人的来信。
    探区工会还请来了理发馆、缝纫组、修鞋组和浆洗房，职工们再也不会拖着长头发、穿着露脚跟的鞋子了。记者在克拉玛依得到的一个很深刻的印象，就是大家在工余都穿得很整洁。缝纫组每天忙碌得很，他们接受了姑娘们大批连衣裙、花布衫等新式服装的订货。
    居住条件也在改善着。现在大部分职工还是住在帐篷、蒙古包、木板房和地窑里，但是新住宅正在一幢幢地兴建起来，有一批工人已经迁入新居。这里还有了广播站、文化学习班、图书馆和医院等文化卫生设施，医院里有X光等设备。文化娱乐生活也很活跃。各种球队已经组成。工会在每周末还放映电影和举行舞蹈晚会。
