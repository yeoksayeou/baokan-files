Xinhua News Agency, Mount Muztagata, August 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ke reported: The Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team's reconnaissance group for Kongur Mountain returned to the newly established Kanchibairsu base camp on the 9th. When they forded the Kanchibairsu stream, all the team members remaining at the base camp formed a line to welcome them.

Kanchibairsu, located at an altitude of 3,700 meters above sea level, is northwest of Mount Muztagata, between Kongur Mountain and Mount Muztagata. It is convenient to conduct reconnaissance of Kongur Mountain and scientific research on Mount Muztagata from here. The Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team began moving here from the Tegangbulak base camp southwest of Mount Muztagata on the 4th, using cars and camel teams. The relocation work was completed on the 7th.

The Kongur Mountain reconnaissance team, which departed on the 5th, consisted of seven people and was led by Kuzmin, the deputy leader of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team and a Soviet meritorious athlete. They advanced along the Kökösel Glacier on the southwest slope of Kongur Mountain, climbed to an altitude of 5,600 meters above sea level on Kongur Mountain, and obtained some information for climbing Kongur Mountain.

Recently, the climate in the Pamir Mountains has changed drastically, with frequent blizzards and sometimes thunderstorms. At 1:00 PM (local time) on the afternoon of the 8th, while the scouts were returning to the base camp, lightning flashed past them, and the scouts' hair and eyebrows were strongly attracted by the electricity, standing up immediately, and all the metal objects around them vibrated and rang, narrowly avoiding an electric shock.

In the past few days, the mountaineering team's scientific research group has also been working near the glacier despite the rain and snow. They have collected dozens of rock and plant specimens.

    侦察公格尔山
    新华社慕士塔格山10日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队侦察公格尔山小组九日回到了新建立的坎其拜尔苏大本营。当他们涉过坎其拜尔流水后，留在大本营的全体队员曾经整队欢迎他们。
    拔海三千七百公尺的坎其拜尔苏在慕士塔格山西北，在公格尔山和慕士塔格山之间。从这里侦察公格尔山和对慕士塔格山作科学研究都很方便。中、苏混合爬山队从四日开始由慕士塔格山西南的特干布拉克大本营用汽车和骆驼队向这里迁移。迁移工作已经在七日全部结束。
    五日出发的公格尔山侦察小组共七人，由中、苏混合爬山队副队长、苏联功勋运动员库兹明率领。他们沿着公格尔山西南坡的寇寇赛冰河前进，曾经攀登到公格尔山拔海五千六百公尺的地方，并且获得了一些攀登公格尔山的资料。
    近来，帕米尔山区一带气候变化骤烈，经常狂风大雪，有时又雷雨交加。八日下午一时（当地时间），侦察员返回大本营途中，闪电从他们近旁掠过，侦察员的头发、眉毛受电力强烈吸引，立即竖起，身旁金属用品全都震动作响，险些中电。
    几天来，爬山队科学研究小组也冒着雨雪在冰河附近工作。他们已经搜集了数十种岩石和植物标本。
