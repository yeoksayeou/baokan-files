    Please Provide Convenience for Bathers
    Yudechi Bathhouse is a relatively large bathhouse in Jinan City, Shandong Province. Especially in the summer, more people come here to bathe. However, in June of this year, the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee used the single rooms upstairs as a guest house, and later allocated the eastern half of the pool seats upstairs to the guest house. As a result, it is difficult for people who go to bathe to find a seat. People hope that the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee can provide convenience for bathers.　Xiu Ting

    请给洗澡者以方便
    浴德池是山东济南市比较大的一个浴池，特别在夏季，到这里洗澡的人更多。但今年六月份，省人民委员会办公厅却把楼上的单房间做为招待所，以后又把楼上东半部的池座也划归招待所所有。这样，去洗澡的人就很难找到座位。人们希望省人民委员会办公厅，能够给洗澡人以方便。　秀亭
