Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 16th: Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo reported to Parliament on the evening of August 15th regarding the incident of the attempted arrest of the Foreign Minister. He said that the claim that Foreign Minister Abdulgani was involved in a corruption case was clearly being used to achieve the political goal of weakening the government.

The incident occurred on August 13th, just as the Foreign Minister was preparing to depart for London to attend the conference on the Suez Canal issue. Some military personnel went to his residence to detain him. At that time, Mrs. Abdulgani informed Sastroamidjojo of the situation by telephone.

Sastroamidjojo went on to say that he immediately contacted Army Chief of Staff Nasution and told him that such actions would greatly damage the country's prestige, as Abdulgani was about to lead a delegation to London to attend the Suez Canal issue conference.

Officials had already announced on August 14th that Foreign Minister Abdulgani would continue to attend the conference on the Suez Canal issue in London.

    印度尼西亚总理在国会报告
    若干军人企图拘捕外交部长
    据新华社雅加达16日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约八月十五日晚在国会就企图拘捕外交部长的事件作了报告。他说，所谓外交部长阿卜杜加尼和贪污案有关显然是被用来达到削弱政府的政治目的。
    事情发生在八月十三日，正当外交部长准备启程到伦敦去参加关于苏彝士运河问题的会议的时候，若干军人到他的住宅去拘留他，当时，阿卜杜加尼夫人把这一情况用电话通知沙斯特罗阿米佐约。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约接着叙述说，他立即同陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安联系，并且告诉这位参谋长说，这样的行动会大大损害国家的威信，因为阿卜杜加尼正在要率领一个代表团到伦敦去参加苏彝士运河问题会议。
    官方已经在八月十四日公布，外交部长阿卜杜加尼将继续在伦敦参加关于苏彝士运河问题的会议。
