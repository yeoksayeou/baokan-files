Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 12th: According to a report in the "Burma Daily" on August 11th, the Burmese government and representatives of the United States in Rangoon are negotiating on the issue of American investment in Burma to operate various industrial and mining enterprises.

According to reports, American investment companies are currently very interested in investing in Burma.

The "Burma Daily" said that American companies have already submitted conditions for investing in Burma for the Burmese government to consider.

The American companies are demanding that the Burmese government must guarantee that industries funded by American companies will not be nationalized for a prescribed number of years.

In the event of nationalization, the investment companies must be fully compensated for their assets, equipment, property, etc. If a decision is made to nationalize, a compensation arbitration committee must be established, comprised of an equal number of representatives from the Burmese government and the relevant American companies.

American companies require that the payment of income tax should be in accordance with current U.S. income tax laws, and that appropriate tariffs must be put in place to protect the enterprise's products from foreign competition.

At the same time, Burma must allow a substantial portion of the profits earned by these enterprises to be remitted back to the United States each year.

It is said that Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and the U.S. Ambassador to Burma are discussing these conditions. The Burmese government believes that foreign investment in Burma must contribute to the development of Burmese industry and help promote the production of commodities that are vital to Burma's economic life. If the negotiations are successful, the two governments will sign an investment guarantee agreement.

    缅美谈判美国在缅甸投资问题
    新华社仰光12日电　据“缅甸人报”八月十一日报道，缅甸政府和美国驻仰光的代表正在进行关于美国在缅甸投资以经营各项工矿企业的谈判。
    据报道，美国的投资公司目前对于在缅甸投资很感兴趣。
    “缅甸人报”说，美国公司已经向缅甸投资的条件，供缅甸政府考虑。
    美国公司要求，缅甸政府必须保证：由美国公司资助的工业在规定的若干年内不得收归国有。
    万一收归国有时，必须全部赔偿投资公司的资产、设备、财产等等。如果决定收归国有，必须设立一个由缅甸政府和有关的美国公司各派同样数目的代表组成的赔偿裁判委员会。
    美国公司要求：缴纳所得税时应按照目前美国的所得税法，必须以适当的关税来保障企业的产品不受外国的竞争。
    同时，缅甸必须允许这些企业所获得的利润的相当的部分每年汇回美国。
    据说，缅甸副总理吴觉迎和美国驻缅甸大使正在讨论这些条件。缅甸政府认为，在缅甸的外国投资必须是有助于缅甸工业的发展和有助于促进对于缅甸经济生活至为重要的商品的生产的。如果谈判成功了的话，两国政府将签订一个投资保证协定。
