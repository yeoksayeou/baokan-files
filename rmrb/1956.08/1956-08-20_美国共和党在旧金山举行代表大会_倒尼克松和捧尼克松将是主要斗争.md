Xinhua News Agency, August 19th. Following closely after the US Democratic National Convention, the ruling Republican Party will also hold its national convention in San Francisco from August 20th to 24th. The convention will nominate the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this year's US election and approve the campaign platform drafted by the party's platform committee.

Within the Republican Party, only Eisenhower has indicated his willingness to participate in the presidential nomination. Therefore, the always-intense struggle over candidate nominations at this convention will mainly revolve around the vice-presidential candidate issue.

Eisenhower suffered two serious illnesses in the past year, which sparked much speculation in American political circles and newspapers about whether he was willing to run or able to serve another term as president, and what might happen if he was elected to another term. Because the Republican Party cannot find another presidential candidate who can replace Eisenhower to win votes and maintain the Republican Party from splitting, the Republican Party machine has had to urge Eisenhower to run again.

Running for the vice-presidency alongside Eisenhower is the current Vice President Nixon. Nixon is very unpopular in the United States because of his extreme right-wing political stance. Given Eisenhower's health, some Republicans worry that the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket risks causing the Republican Party to suffer a defeat, because voters, considering the possibility of Nixon succeeding Eisenhower as president, may not vote for the Republican Party. At the same time, the "internationalist" faction within the Republican Party is also worried that if Eisenhower's health suffers an accident after being re-elected, power in the White House will fall into the hands of Nixon, who represents the "isolationist" forces within the Republican Party, which they are extremely unwilling to see. Therefore, not long ago, a "Dump Nixon Movement" broke out within the Republican Party, demanding Massachusetts Governor Herter as the vice-presidential candidate.

The "Dump Nixon Movement" initiated by Stassen is still ongoing. According to US news agencies, influential figures within the Republican Party, such as Senator Nolan, strongly support Nixon. Knight, one of the three giants of the California Republican Party (the other two are Nolan and Nixon), once indicated that he did not support Nixon because of his power struggle with Nixon. However, he was almost deprived of his position as the head of the California delegation to the Republican National Convention by Nolan because of this. Therefore, this largest delegation has now promised to support Nixon.

The Republican Party's campaign platform has not yet been announced. Sources say that it will still use "peace and prosperity" as its main campaign slogan. At the same time, given that the past four years of governance have not fulfilled the promise of this slogan put forward in 1952, it can only rely on Eisenhower's personal "prestige" to win votes. The Republican Party machine is vigorously promoting Eisenhower's role in international affairs, especially at last year's Geneva Four-Power Summit, adding a "peacemaker" image to his wartime hero image from World War II. This is to divert voters' dissatisfaction with the Republican government's "brinkmanship" and "massive retaliation" policies.

According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine: One of the most troubling issues in the Republican campaign is the agricultural crisis. Fearing that the deepening agricultural crisis over the past four years will cause the Republican Party to lose a large number of farmer votes, Eisenhower is preparing to set up his campaign headquarters in Wisconsin, a key area in the Midwest agricultural region, to try to ease farmers' discontent.

### 美国共和党在旧金山举行代表大会  倒尼克松和捧尼克松将是主要斗争

    美国共和党在旧金山举行代表大会
    倒尼克松和捧尼克松将是主要斗争
    新华社19日讯　紧接在美国民主党全国代表大会之后，现在执政的共和党也将在八月二十日到二十四日在旧金山举行全国代表大会。代表大会将为今年的美国大选推举出共和党的总统和副总统候选人，并且批准党的纲领委员会拟定的竞选纲领。
    在共和党内部，现在只有艾森豪威尔一个人表示愿意参加总统候选人提名，因此，在这个代表大会上，总是十分激烈的关于候选人提名的斗争将主要围绕着副总统候选人问题进行。
    艾森豪威尔一年来两次身得重病，曾经在美国政界和报刊中间引起许多关于他是否愿意参加竞选或者是否能够连任总统，以及如果当选连任可能会发生什么意外的揣测。由于共和党找不出另外一个能够代替艾森豪威尔来博取选票并且能够代替他来维系共和党免于分裂的总统候选人，共和党的党机器不得不敦促艾森豪威尔再出来竞选。
    和艾森豪威尔一起竞选副职的是现任副总统尼克松。尼克松由于他的极右的政治立场而在美国非常不得人心。鉴于艾森豪威尔的健康情况，共和党内有人担心艾森豪威尔——尼克松竞选名单有使共和党遭受失败的危险，因为选民在估计到尼克松继艾森豪威尔出任总统的时候，就可能不投共和党的票。同时共和党内的“国际派”分子也担心万一艾森豪威尔的健康在连任总统后发生意外，就会使白宫权力落入代表共和党内代表“孤立派”势力的尼克松的手里，而这是他们所极不愿意的。因此，不久以前，在共和党内爆发了一个“倒尼克松运动”，要求以马萨诸塞州州长赫脱为副总统候选人。
    由史塔生发动的“倒尼克松运动”目前仍然在进行中。据美国通讯社报道，共和党内有势力的人物像参议员诺兰等，坚决支持尼克松。加里福尼亚州共和党三巨头之一奈特（另外两个是诺兰和尼克松）因为和尼克松争权夺利曾一度表示不支持尼克松。可是，他因此而险些被诺兰弄得失去这个州出席共和党代表大会的代表团团长的职位。因此这个最大的代表团现在已经答应支持尼克松。
    共和党的竞选纲领目前还没有公布。有消息说，它将仍然以“和平与繁荣”作为主要的竞选口号。同时，鉴于过去四年的施政并没有使它在1952年提出的这个口号得到兑现，它只能打算依靠艾森豪威尔的个人“声望”来拉选票。共和党的党机器正在大吹大擂地宣传艾森豪威尔在国际事务中、特别是在去年日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上的作用，在他的第二次世界大战战时英雄面貌之外，再给他加上一个“和平缔造者”的面貌。以此来转移选民对共和党政府的“战争边缘”政策和“大规模报复”政策的不满。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说：共和党竞选中最头痛的问题之一是农业危机。由于害怕过去四年来农业危机的日益加深会使共和党失去大量农民选票，艾森豪威尔正准备把他的竞选总部设在中西部农业地区的关键地带威斯康星州，来设法缓和农民的不满情绪。
