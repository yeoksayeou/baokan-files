    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 8th: The Communist Party of Indonesia, at a press conference held on August 3rd, released the resolutions of the recent Fourth Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Party.
    The resolution stated that after in-depth discussions, the meeting adopted the report entitled "Unite to Strive to Realize the Demands of the August 1945 Revolution," made by General Secretary Aidit of the Communist Party of Indonesia on behalf of the Politburo, and expressed full support for the new tasks outlined in the report in the political, organizational, and ideological spheres.
    The resolution also adopted and agreed with the Politburo's political line and its activities in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia and the resolutions of previous plenary meetings of the Central Committee.
    The resolution stated that the plenary meeting noted with satisfaction the strengthening of the people's forces in Indonesia, and the consistent loyalty of the Indonesian people and youth to the goals of the August Revolution. The plenary meeting concluded with satisfaction that the emergence of an international united front against war and colonialism is a democratic and progressive development, which is conducive to the cause of peace and independence.
    The plenary meeting agreed with the Politburo's conclusion on the international and domestic situation: broad possibilities exist for developing the people's movement and the Party.
    The meeting considered that the current international situation also demonstrates the extraordinary progress of the movement for national independence and the decline of the imperialist and colonialist system.
    The resolution stated that the resolution program of the First All-Indonesia People's Congress held in August 1955 and the program of the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, although one program is better than the other, both programs can serve as the direction for the daily struggle of the Indonesian people, because both programs have already been agreed upon by the majority of Muslim and nationalist masses and the entire Communist Party masses.
    The plenary meeting respects the active independent foreign policy of the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet and condemns those who hope to pursue a two-faced policy—that is, progressive in diplomacy and reactionary in domestic affairs.
    The major task of the Communist Party of Indonesia at present is to urge Indonesia to implement a more active anti-colonialist and peaceful policy to strengthen Indonesia's position among the countries of the world, especially in Asia and Africa. At the same time, the Communists must strive to ensure that Indonesia's strong international position can be used to serve the interests of its own people, especially in eliminating the economic influence of the Dutch big capitalists.
    The resolution stated that the plenary meeting agreed with Aidit's report's clear analysis of the existence of three forces in the balance of domestic political forces: stubborn forces, progressive forces, and intermediate forces. The plenary meeting also fully agreed with the political line of making every effort to unremittingly develop the progressive forces, unite the intermediate forces, and isolate the stubborn forces.
    This plenary meeting agreed with the conclusion that, based on the analysis of the influence of Indonesian political parties among the masses, the Communist Party of Indonesia must strive to unite the Muslim (and other religious) masses, the nationalist masses, and the communist masses to carry out the struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Based on the analysis of the various classes within Indonesia, the Communist Party of Indonesia must make efforts to unite the workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, revolutionary intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, that is, to unite the progressive forces and the intermediate forces.
    The resolution then analyzed the interrelationship between the general program and the program of current demands put forward by the Communist Party of Indonesia. The resolution stated that the plenary meeting affirmed that the Party's general program indeed puts forward the Party's struggle goals in the entire stage of the national and democratic revolution, in the entire stage of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, while the program of current demands can be changed according to the changes and differences in the situation, but no matter how frequently it may change, the task remains the same, that is, to unite the people and meet the economic and political demands of the vast majority of the people in the initial stages of the national and democratic revolution.
    The meeting was convinced that the principle of realizing the demands of the August Revolution in the general program as a long-term program is correct. The meeting also affirmed that, according to the general program, a program of demands has been formulated as a program for discussion and cooperation with those who oppose colonialism, which has many similarities with the program of the Second Sastroamidjojo Cabinet and the resolutions passed by the First All-Indonesia People's Congress. It has also been used as a demand on the current government and as an instruction for mass actions.
    The resolution said, when referring to the parliamentary struggle, that the Politburo made it clear that the Communist Party of Indonesia not only regards the parliament as a forum for propaganda, but also puts forward progressive demands in many aspects. It is possible to transition from Indonesia's current situation to a people's regime through parliamentary methods. The Communist Party of Indonesia will insist on striving to turn this possibility into reality, but the Communist Party of Indonesia and the entire people must be vigilant against the sinister attempts of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries who oppose the transition to a people's regime through parliamentary methods. The existence of the possibility of a peaceful transition to a people's regime does not mean that the Communist Party of Indonesia must only work more actively within the parliament. It must continue to work to awaken and mobilize the masses, especially the workers and peasants.
    The resolution stated that the plenary meeting considered that the current demands of the people include the demands of all revolutionary classes, including the demands of the proletariat represented by the Communist Party of Indonesia. Therefore, if a cabinet crisis occurs, the Communist Party of Indonesia will put forward the demand to organize a national united government. However, whether the Communist Party of Indonesia wants to participate in such a cabinet depends on two questions: first, whether the program of such a cabinet represents the interests of the people, and second, whether the composition of the cabinet can guarantee the realization of the above-mentioned program.
    The plenary meeting considered that the program of demands stipulated as slogans for action represents the urgent interests of all revolutionary, democratic, and patriotic classes and groups in the motherland. Realizing the program of demands of the Communist Party of Indonesia will develop all progressive forces, unite the progressive forces and the intermediate forces, and will only be detrimental to the stubborn forces and their masters. After the program of demands is realized, the struggle of the Indonesian people will develop to the stage of realizing the general program to thoroughly achieve the various demands of the August Revolution.
    The resolution went on to say that the plenary meeting fully agreed with the view mentioned in Aidit's report that the Communist Party of Indonesia, which has more than one million members and has been tested by two general elections, has become one of the largest communist parties in the world. The growth of the Communist Party of Indonesia is a reflection of the growth and high political consciousness and high organizational ability of the Indonesian working people. After the victorious results of the past general elections, the attitude of the Communist Party of Indonesia on every issue has been expected and noticed by the people, and at the same time, progressive people do expect more leadership from the Communist Party of Indonesia. Aware of our responsibilities, we will develop this reality by intensifying our efforts to safeguard the daily interests of the people and redouble our courage, vigilance, preparedness, wisdom, and perseverance in the struggle to realize the demands of the people stipulated in the Party program.
    The resolution pointed out that it is only possible to complete these tasks when the unity within the Party is consolidated, and the unity in ideology, policy, and organization. In order to achieve this, the primary task of the Communist Party of Indonesia at present is to re-examine the Party ranks, find out the shortcomings of the Party and eliminate these shortcomings.
    The resolution then pointed out the guidelines for improving the various tasks of Party building.
    The resolution concluded by saying that the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, with the Politburo's report as a guide, believes that the Communist Party of Indonesia has the strength to complete its glorious and arduous task: to realize the various demands of the people, and finally to realize all the demands of the August Revolution based on the slogan of "thoroughly eradicating imperialism and feudalism."

    印度尼西亚共产党中央扩大会议通过决议
    团结大多数人民促进民族和民主革命
    促使国家执行更积极的反殖民主义政策和和平政策
    新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚共产党在八月三日举行的一个记者招待会上，发表了党中央委员会最近举行的第四次扩大全体会议的决议。
    决议说，这次会议在经过深入讨论后，通过了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在会上代表政治局所作的题为“团结起来争取实现1945年8月革命的要求”的报告，并且表示完全支持报告中所综述的在政治、组织和思想方面的新任务。
    决议还通过并且同意政治局的政治方针以及它在执行印度尼西亚共产党第五次全国代表大会决议和中央委员会以前几次全体会议决议时所进行的活动。
    决议说，全体会议满意地注意到印度尼西亚人民力量得到加强，印度尼西亚人民和青年一贯忠于八月革命的目的。全体会议满意地作出结论，认为反战争和反殖民主义国际统一战线的出现是民主和进步的发展，这种发展有利于和平和独立的事业。
    全体会议同意政治局对于国际和国内形势所作出的这个结论：发展人民运动和党的广泛可能性是存在的。
    会议认为，目前的国际形势也表明了争取民族独立的运动的非凡的进展和帝国主义殖民主义体系的衰退。
    决议说，在1955年8月召开的第一届全印度尼西亚人民代表大会的决议纲领和第二次阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁的纲领，虽然一个纲领比另一个纲领好，但是两个纲领都可以作为印度尼西亚人民日常斗争的方向，因为两个纲领都已经为大多数的穆斯林和民族主义者群众和整个共产党群众所同意了。
    全体会议尊重第二次阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁的积极的独立外交政策，并且谴责那些希望奉行两面政策——就是说，在外交方面进步，在内政方面反动——的人。
    印度尼西亚共产党目前的重大任务是促使印度尼西亚执行更积极的反殖民主义政策和和平政策，以加强印度尼西亚在世界各国，特别是在亚非国家之间的地位。同时，共产党人必须努力使印度尼西亚的强有力的国际地位能够被用来为它本国人民的利益服务，特别是在肃清荷兰大资本家的经济影响方面。
    决议说，全体会议同意艾地的报告中关于国内政治力量对比中存在着顽固势力、进步势力和中间势力三种势力的明晰的分析。全体会议也完全同意尽一切力量不懈地发展进步力量，团结中间力量，孤立顽固力量的政治方针。
    这次全体会议同意这样的结论：根据关于印度尼西亚各党派在群众中的影响的分析，印度尼西亚共产党必须努力使穆斯林（和其他宗教）群众、民族主义者群众和共产主义者群众团结起来，进行反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争。根据对于印度尼西亚国内各阶级的分析，印度尼西亚共产党必须进行努力，使工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、革命知识分子和民族资产阶级团结起来，这也就是说使进步力量和中间力量团结起来。
    决议接着分析了印度尼西亚共产党提出的总纲领和当前要求的纲领之间的相互关系。决议说，全体会议肯定，党的总纲领的确提出了党在民族和民主革命的整个阶段，在反帝国主义和反封建革命的整个阶段的斗争目标，而当前要求的纲领能够按照情况的变化和不同加以改变，但是不管它可能改变得多么频繁，任务仍然是一样，就是在民族和民主革命的最初几个阶段中团结人民和满足绝大多数人民的经济和政治要求。
    会议确信作为长期纲领的总纲领中实现八月革命的要求的原则是正确的。会议还肯定，根据总纲领，已经拟订了要求纲领，作为同那些反对殖民主义的人们进行讨论和合作的纲领，这个纲领同第二次沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁的纲领以及第一届全印度尼西亚人民代表大会所通过的决议有很多相同之处。它还被用来作为对现政府提出的要求和对群众行动的指示。
    决议在提到议会斗争时说，政治局明白表示印度尼西亚共产党不仅认为议会是进行宣传的讲坛，而且也在许多方面提出进步的要求。通过议会方法从印度尼西亚目前的状况过渡到人民政权是可能的。印度尼西亚共产党将坚持努力把这种可能变成现实，但是印度尼西亚共产党和全体人民必须警惕那些反对通过议会方法过渡到人民当政制度的国内外反革命分子的罪恶企图。通过和平方法过渡到人民当政制度的可能性的存在，并不意味着印度尼西亚共产党只有在议会内部才必须更加积极地进行工作。它必须继续努力唤醒和动员群众，特别是工农群众。
    决议说，全体会议认为，目前人民的要求包括有一切革命的阶级的要求，其中也包括印度尼西亚共产党所代表的无产阶级的要求。因此，如果内阁发生危机，印度尼西亚共产党将提出组织民族联合政府的要求。但是，印度尼西亚共产党是否想参加这种内阁，那要取决于两个问题：首先是这种内阁的纲领是否代表人民的利益，第二是内阁的组成是否能够保证上述纲领的实现。
    全体会议认为，规定为行动口号的要求纲领所代表的，是祖国一切革命、民主和爱国的阶级和集团的迫切利益。实现印度尼西亚共产党的要求纲领就会发展一切进步势力，团结进步势力和中间势力，而只会不利于顽固势力和他们的主子。在要求纲领实现以后，印度尼西亚人民的斗争将发展到实现总纲领以彻底达到八月革命的各项要求的阶段。
    决议接着说，全体会议完全同意艾地的报告中所谈到的看法，即：拥有一百万以上的党员和经受过两次普选的考验的印度尼西亚共产党，已经成为世界上最大的共产党之一。印度尼西亚共产党的壮大是印度尼西亚劳动人民的壮大和高度政治觉悟和高度组织能力的反映。在过去的普选得到胜利结果之后，印度尼西亚共产党对每一个问题的态度受到了人民的期望和注意，同时进步人士的确盼望从印度尼西亚共产党得到更多的领导。由于意识到我们的责任，我们将发展这种现实，办法是为维护人民的日常利益而加紧努力，在为实现党纲所规定的人民的要求而进行的斗争中加倍增加我们的勇气、警惕、准备、智慧和坚忍不拔的精神。
    决议指出，只有当巩固了党内的团结，在思想上、政策上和组织上的团结的时候，才有可能完成这些任务。为了达到这一点，目前印度尼西亚共产党的首要任务是重新检查党的队伍，找出党的缺点和消灭这种缺点。
    决议接着指出了改进党的建设的各项工作的方针。
    决议最后说，以政治局报告为指针的具有历史意义的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第四次全体会议相信：印度尼西亚共产党有力量完成它的这种光荣而繁重的任务：实现人民的各种要求，最后实现以“彻底铲除帝国主义和封建主义”的口号为基础的八月革命的一切要求。
