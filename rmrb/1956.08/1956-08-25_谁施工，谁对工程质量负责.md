It is the bounden duty of the construction and installation departments to guarantee that projects of excellent quality are handed over to the state. Over the past few years, although the construction and installation enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have guaranteed the quality of most key projects, quality accidents have been extremely frequent during the construction process. Many projects have undergone multiple reworkings before quality was assured. These quality accidents have caused a large waste of manpower and material resources to the state. Taking the Anshan area as an example, in 1955 alone, more than 3,000 quality accidents occurred, resulting in a loss of 188,800 yuan. In June of this year, in a certain project of the 401 factory undertaken by the Sixth Construction Corporation, the quality accidents involving only 18 column bases resulted in a loss of more than 4,000 yuan. As for the impact of quality accidents on the construction period, it is even more difficult to estimate. Therefore, how to take effective measures to reverse the frequent rework and poor quality of construction and installation projects has become an important issue that must be seriously addressed by all construction departments.

In the past, in order to ensure project quality, many construction and installation enterprises had established large technical supervision institutions or independent technical inspection organizations. Inspectors were deployed at the site, and every time a process was completed, it had to undergo one or two inspections. With such a strict inspection system, it should be said that the quality of the project should be guaranteed; however, in fact, serious quality accidents still occurred one after another. The key to the problem is that the project is carried out by construction personnel, and inspectors can only carry out inspections after the project is completed or has reached a stage, which makes it difficult to "prevent problems before they occur," so quality accidents are difficult to avoid.

The Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry accepted the experiences and lessons of the past few years, and from the second quarter of this year, it determined the policy of strengthening mass self-inspection to ensure project quality. This policy requires mobilizing the masses, so that every construction worker can consciously shoulder the important task of ensuring project quality, and truly achieve "whoever constructs, is responsible for project quality"; paying attention to quality inspection at any time and place, and finding and correcting quality problems in a timely manner; changing the past practice of solely relying on technical inspectors for "independent inspection", and focusing the work of technical inspectors on supervising the preparation for construction, doing a good job of technical explanation, and implementing the self-inspection system during construction; at the same time, simplifying self-inspection procedures as much as possible to avoid spending time filling out self-inspection records, so that construction personnel have more time to carry out quality inspections.

Initially, many units were not very resolute in implementing this policy. Some leaders did not trust the masses, fearing that the masses would be irresponsible, and believing that in the past, even with dedicated personnel for inspection, the quality of the project could not be guaranteed, so how could allowing the masses to inspect themselves guarantee that no accidents would occur.

The facts of the past few months have proved that this concern is unnecessary. The important issue is to explain to the masses the benefits of strengthening self-inspection; as long as the propaganda and education work is truly done well, the broad masses can shoulder the responsibility of inspecting their own project quality. At present, many construction and installation enterprises' worker groups have taken the initiative to propose measures to improve quality. For example, the youth commando team of the Fourth Construction Corporation, led by Li Changzhi, proposed a "three accurate" project quality guarantee, including accurate making, accurate installation, and accurate inspection. The Fu Dongchang team formulated a self-inspection system of "inspecting as we work, specialized self-inspection, handing it over to the team after it is qualified, and handing it over to the construction foreman after the team leader inspects and it is qualified." After the Second Mining Engineering Company of Anshan Construction Corporation strengthened self-inspection, the workers guaranteed that the quality inspection would pass at one time, and listed it as one of the central contents of the collective contracts signed by each team.

Up to now, the time for the construction and installation enterprises affiliated with the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to implement the policy of strengthening self-inspection is not very long, and there are not many units with a very solid foundation for self-inspection. However, even from the preliminary achievements, strengthening self-inspection has produced good results in ensuring project quality. According to the statistics of various construction and installation units, the number of quality accidents that occurred in the second quarter of this year decreased by more than 1,000 compared with the same period last year. If we look at the losses caused by quality accidents for every 10,000 yuan of work completed, the average was 18 yuan in the second quarter of last year, and only 6 yuan in the second quarter of this year, a reduction of two-thirds. In particular, the achievements of some units that have carried out self-inspection work better are even more significant. For example, the Second Engineering Company of the Fifth Construction Corporation strengthened self-inspection work in April of this year. There were seven quality accidents in April, with a loss of more than 300 yuan. There were only four quality accidents in May, with a loss of only 10 yuan. In June, the number of quality accidents had been reduced to two, and the loss was also very small. After the Fourth Construction Corporation strengthened self-inspection work, the number of quality accidents also decreased month by month. This company had 36 quality accidents in the first quarter of this year, including 6 major accidents, while only 27 general quality accidents occurred in the second quarter, and all major accidents were eliminated. The Second Mining Engineering Company of Anshan Construction Corporation hardly had any quality accidents in the second quarter. However, in some units that do not attach importance to self-inspection work and where self-inspection work is only a formality, such as the Sixth and Seventh Construction Corporations, there were still many quality accidents in the first half of this year, and many accidents were also of a more serious nature.

Some people also worry that self-inspection work will affect the progress of the project. The facts of the past few months have proved that this concern is also unnecessary. In the past, with the method of solely relying on technical inspectors for "independent inspection," every process had to wait for technical personnel to inspect it, and there was often a delay of one or two days between the upper and lower processes before construction could continue. Since strengthening self-inspection work, the procedure of waiting for the inspector to inspect when the upper and lower processes are handed over has been cancelled, thus speeding up the progress. For example, the Fourth Construction Corporation, in doing an identical project in a certain factory, used to take three days to complete, but after strengthening self-inspection work, it can be completed in half a day, with efficiency increased several times.

Strengthening self-inspection work has also increased the interest of construction and inspection personnel in studying and improving technology. Because they all understand that only by improving technology can they discover and prevent project quality accidents, and can they truly ensure project quality. Since strengthening self-inspection work, the technical inspection personnel of many units have shifted their attention to preventing quality accidents. Some have taken the initiative to help foremen and workers become familiar with drawings and correct improper operations in a timely manner.

The significance of strengthening self-inspection work for ensuring project quality is unquestionable. However, there are still some issues in the specific methods that require further efforts by various construction and installation enterprises in their future work to create and accumulate experience.

    谁施工，谁对工程质量负责
    方萱
    保证把优等质量的工程交给国家，是建筑安装部门的天职。几年来，冶金工业部所属各建筑安装企业，虽然保证了大部分重点工程的质量，但是在施工过程中，质量事故还是极其频繁的，有许多工程项目都是经历了多次返工，才保证了质量。这些质量事故，给国家造成了大量人力和物力的浪费。拿鞍山一个地区来说，在1955年一年中，就发生过三千多次质量事故，损失费用达十八万八千八百多元。今年六月份，第六建筑总公司在四○一厂的某项工程中，仅十八个柱基发生的质量事故，就损失了四千多元。至于因质量事故给工期的影响，就更难估计了。因此，如何采取有效措施，扭转建筑安装工程返工频繁、质量低劣的情况，已经成为各建筑部门必须认真解决的一个重要问题。
    过去，为了保证工程质量，许多建筑安装企业曾经设立了庞大的技术监督机构或独立的技术检查组织，检查人员遍于现场，每当一道工序施工完毕，就要经过一、两次检查。如此严密的检查制度，按说工程质量应该有保证了；但是事实上严重的质量事故，仍然是层出不穷。问题的关键就在于工程是施工人员作的，检查人员只能在工程完工或者告一段落以后进行检查，这就很难作到“防患于未然”，因此质量事故也就很难避免了。
    冶金工业部建筑局接受几年来的经验教训，从今年第二季度起，确定了用加强群众性的自检工作来保证工程质量的方针。这个方针要求放手发动群众，使每个施工人员都能自觉的担负起保证工程质量的重大任务，真正做到“谁施工，谁负责工程质量”；随时随地注意质量检查，发现质量有问题，及时设法纠正；改变过去单纯依靠技术检查人员“独立检查”的作法，把技术检查人员的工作重点放在督促做好施工准备，做好技术交底以及在施工中执行自检制度上；同时又尽量简化自检手续，避免把时间都花在填写自检记录上，让施工人员有更多的时间进行质量检查。
    最初，不少单位在贯彻执行这个方针的时候并不是很坚决的，有些领导人员不相信群众，怕群众不负责任，认为过去有专人检查，还保证不了工程质量，让群众自己检查又怎样能保证不出事故呢。
    几个月来的事实证明，这种顾虑是没有必要的，重要的问题在于向群众说明加强自检工作的好处；只要真正做好了宣传教育工作，广大群众是可以担负起自己检查工程质量的责任的。目前已经有不少建筑安装企业的工人小组主动提出改进质量的措施。例如第四建筑总公司青年突击队李长志小组，提出制作准、安装准、检查准等“三准”的工程质量保证书，傅东昌小组订出“随作随检查，专人自检，合格后才交小组，组长检查合格后才交施工工长”的自检制度。鞍山建筑总公司第二矿山工程公司，加强自检工作以后，工人们保证质量检查一次合格，并把它列为各小组签订集体合同的中心内容之一。
    到目前为止，冶金工业部建筑局所属各建筑安装企业，贯彻加强自检工作的方针的时间虽然还不算长，自检工作的基础很巩固的单位也还不多，但是，即便从初步获得的成绩来看，加强自检工作对保证工程质量也已产生了良好的效果。根据各建筑安装单位的统计，今年第二季度发生的质量事故，比去年同期减少了一千多次。如果拿每完成一万元的工作量因质量事故造成的损失来看，去年第二季度平均是十八元，今年第二季度平均只有六元，已经减少了三分之二。尤其是一些开展自检工作较好的单位，成绩更加显著。例如第五建筑总公司的第二工程公司，今年四月份起加强了自检工作，四月份发生的质量事故是七次，损失三百多元，五月份发生的质量事故只四次，损失仅十元，六月份质量事故已经减少到两次，损失也很小。第四建筑总公司加强自检工作以后，质量事故也逐月减少，这个公司在今年第一季度曾发生质量事故三十六次，内有六次重大事故，而第二季度只发生一般质量事故二十七次，重大事故全部消灭了。鞍山建筑总公司的第二矿山工程公司，第二季度几乎没有发生质量事故。但是，在一些不重视自检工作和自检工作流于形式的像第六、第七建筑总公司等单位，今年上半年的质量事故仍然很多，而且许多事故的性质也比较严重。
    还有些人担心自检工作会影响工程进度。几个月来的事实证明，这种顾虑也是不必要的。过去那种单纯依靠技术检查人员“独立检查”的办法，每个工序完毕都得等待技术人员检查，上下工序之间，往往要拖一两天的时间才能继续施工。自从加强自检工作以后，上下工序交接时等待检查员检查的手续取消了，因此也就加快了进度。像第四建筑总公司，在某厂做一项完全相同的工程，过去要三天才能完成，加强自检工作后，半天就可以完成，效率提高了几倍。
    加强自检工作，也提高了施工和检查人员钻研和改进技术的兴趣。因为他们都明白，只有提高了技术，才能发现和预防工程质量事故，才能真正保证工程质量。自从加强自检工作以后，已有不少单位的技术检查人员，把注意力转移到预防质量事故方面去了。有的主动帮助工长和工人熟悉图纸，及时纠正操作不当的现象。
    加强自检工作，对保证工程质量的意义，是无可置疑的。但是，在具体作法上还有一些问题，仍需各建筑安装企业在今后工作中作进一步的努力，来创造和积累经验。
