    More Than Ninety Enterprises Across the Country are Rushing to Manufacture Equipment for the Tractor Factory
    The First Group of Technicians Transferred and Trained by Various Regions Have Arrived at the Factory
    (Our Report) In order to support the tractor factory in producing tractors ahead of schedule, ninety-six factories across the country are rushing to manufacture mechanical equipment for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant needs tens of thousands of machines, parts, and sets in total. Among these, apart from those manufactured with the help of the Soviet Union, about 90% are manufactured by our own country. Many of these products are being produced for the first time in our country. For example, the six types of large machine tools undertaken by the Shenyang First and Second Machine Tool Plants, and the bridge-type grab cranes undertaken by the Dalian Crane Plant. Since the tractor factory proposed earlier this year that some workshops be put into production ahead of schedule, many factories have been actively rushing to manufacture them, striving to deliver the equipment ahead of schedule. More than thirty factories have already delivered more than 1,000 machines, parts, and sets ahead of schedule, creating favorable conditions for the upcoming equipment installation work.

    Furthermore, the first batch of workers needed for the First Tractor Plant to start production this year has recently arrived at the factory. This batch of workers includes a total of seventy-six people, including lathe operators, fitters, and milling machine operators. Some of them were sent by the tractor factory to fraternal factories for training and have returned after completing their training, while others were sent by fraternal factories to support the tractor factory.
    Thanks to the enthusiastic training provided by various fraternal factories, the technical level of the workers studying in foreign factories has improved rapidly over the past year or so. The four lathe operators who studied in the production workshop of the Shanghai Bicycle Factory had never seen automatic lathes before, but now they are all able to operate them skillfully. The workers who studied in the repair workshop of the Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory not only improved their technical level, but also worked with other workers to improve production tools, increasing production efficiency by about five times.

    全国九十多个企业为拖拉机厂赶制设备
    各地抽调和代为培养的第一批技工已经到厂
    本报讯　为了支援拖拉机厂提前出拖拉机，全国有九十六个工厂正为第一拖拉机制造厂赶制机械设备。第一拖拉机制造厂全部需要的机械达数万台、件、套。其中除苏联帮助我们制造的以外，有90％左右靠我国自己制造。在这些产品中，好多都是我国从来没有生产过的。像沈阳第一、第二机床厂承制的六种大型机床，大连起重机厂承制的桥式抓斗吊车，今年自从拖拉机厂提出部分车间提前投入生产以后，许多厂都在积极赶制，争取提前交付设备。现在已有三十多个工厂提前交付了一千多台、件、套的设备，为即将开始的设备安装工作创造了有利条件。（河南日报）
    又讯　第一拖拉机厂今年开工生产所需要的工人，第一批已于最近到厂。这批工人，有车工、钳工、铣工等共七十六人。他们有的是拖拉机厂派到兄弟厂学习期满回来的，有的是兄弟厂派来支援拖拉机厂的。
    在外厂学习的工人，由于各兄弟厂的热情培育，一年多来，技术水平提高得都很快。在上海自行车厂生产车间学习的四个车工，过去都没有见过自动车床，现在都能够熟练地进行操作，在上海纺织机械厂修理车间学习的工人，不但提高了自己的技术水平，还和其他工人一起，改进了生产工具，使生产效率提高了五倍左右。（河南日报）
