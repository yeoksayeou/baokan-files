    Eliminate All Resistance, Enliven and Strengthen Democratic Life
    Lu Zhi
    Recently, our Party and our country have shown a new atmosphere in promoting and strengthening democratic life both inside and outside the Party, and in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. This new atmosphere is fully reflected in the National People's Congress and the Party Congresses of various provinces that were held not long ago. This new atmosphere is very exciting and encouraging. Because it is by relying on it that we can better stimulate and mobilize all positive factors inside and outside the Party to make more effective contributions to the great and arduous socialist construction.
    But it would be wrong for anyone to think that further improving democratic life and overcoming subjectivism and bureaucraticism will be smooth sailing and will not require tenacious struggle. Here, I would like to especially mention the necessity and importance of eliminating all habitual resistance that is not conducive to improving democratic life.
    Just over half a year ago, a certain comrade, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee on opposing right-leaning conservatism (and subjective empiricism), and in the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything," raised some opinions to a certain leading organ regarding some problems in the work. The motivation for raising the opinions was undoubtedly good, and the content of the opinions was basically appropriate, or worthy of reference. The person in charge of the leading organ handled these opinions in a relatively humble and serious manner, and many comrades also believed that raising the opinions was justified; but how did some surrounding comrades view this action of his? Look: it was simply a cacophony, a collective attack, and making things difficult for him. Some comrades said: Are you raising these opinions with some personal emotions mixed in? What is your motive? What is your purpose? One comrade said sarcastically: Ha, not simple, silent until it speaks, and then it surprises everyone! An old comrade who had not seen him for a long time said even more bluntly: Are you trying to show off? This is the so-called pursuit of "motive" theory. Some comrades said: You should do your own work first, mind less of these "idle affairs," I have so much experience in this regard, otherwise you will suffer. This is called the don't mind "idle affairs" theory. There were also some comrades who said: Your views must be very one-sided, can you really be so familiar with the situation? We must be cautious, in short, you are inconsiderate and a bit reckless. Still other comrades said: Writing a report is a very serious matter, don't write a report here and a report there, it will be annoying, even if your motive is good, if the content you raise is inappropriate, it will not be good for you. This is another "caution" theory and "weighing the pros and cons" theory. Even more incomprehensible is that a responsible comrade even flew into a rage and questioned: Who are you preparing to show this thick book to! What contribution have you made to the revolution!
    What can you call these various unhealthy trends and fallacies that are not conducive to normal democratic life? I think we can only call them stubborn and hateful negative factors and habitual resistance. Of course, many comrades' remarks are mostly unintentional, spontaneous, and sometimes even out of a position of caring for comrades, but precisely because of this, it is even more terrible.
    The fact is very clear, a comrade raises his own opinions and views on the problems existing in the work, instead of welcoming him with full enthusiasm, you first question his motive, what will be the result? Needless to say that there is no personal motive involved, even if some are mixed in, should you first ask about the motive instead of looking at whether the content of the opinion is justified? As for the theory of not minding "idle affairs," this is even more of a vulgar argument. In fact, it is to ask everyone to "only care for oneself" and not to "benefit the world at the same time," because, the "idle affairs" they are talking about are often major issues that are unrelated to themselves but related to the Party, the country, and the people, shouldn't every revolutionary be concerned about such "idle affairs"? Then where is your revolutionary sense of justice and responsibility reflected? As for the so-called "caution" theory that your views are not comprehensive or inconsiderate, maybe you yourself think or others have thought that you are "experienced, stable, and principled," but in most cases, this is just a cowardly and passive "cancellationist" excuse. Indeed, one should strive to be comprehensive and well-founded when making suggestions, but one's work has great limitations after all, and in fact it is difficult for him to achieve broader, more comprehensive and specific insight and understanding, so, is it not also necessary and beneficial to talk about one's impressions, feelings and views based on one's limited knowledge, observations and hearings? As for the so-called "weighing the pros and cons" theory that proceeds from the perspective of personal gain or loss everywhere, this is even more of a despicable and decadent thought, it has nothing in common with the qualities of an upright revolutionary. As for the kind of aggressive absurd theory such as "what contribution have you made to the revolution," it is even more absurd and unworthy of attention, because it expresses a typical privilege mentality.
    The above-mentioned various unreasonable arguments that are not conducive to democratic life must not be regarded as isolated and accidental examples in our Party and country, but rather as having a certain or more or less universal and typical significance. Even according to the many examples published in the People's Daily, it can be fully illustrated that, at present in our Party and country, due to the loud calls and resolute opposition of the Party and the government, the phenomenon of daring to openly suppress legitimate criticism has been greatly reduced, but the kind of reluctance to listen to criticism, even disguised suppression, giving various cold receptions, accusations, and various kinds of remarks and styles that are not conducive to democratic life, are still numerous. These stubborn and hateful negative factors and habitual resistance, although their market has become narrower and narrower recently, have not been thoroughly and forcefully liquidated and corrected.
    The problem is very clear, due to the superiority of our social system, the provisions of the Constitution and the Party Constitution guarantee the most basic democratic life of our Party and all citizens. The problem is that we are not satisfied with the existing situation, we want to further promote and improve our precious democratic life, so as to better exert all positive factors and prevent and correct the occurrence of errors and shortcomings. Our respectable ancestors taught us: "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, listen to one side and you will be in the dark." The great Lenin taught us: After the proletariat has seized power, we must be especially careful about the breeding and harm of new types of bureaucracy. Our leader Chairman Mao earnestly instructed us: The criticizer and the criticized should "know everything and say everything; those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should take it as a warning; correct it if you have it, and encourage it if you don't." At a time when our Party and government are vigorously strengthening democratic life inside and outside the Party, people with various remarks and styles that are not conducive to democratic life should be awakened: it is time to make up your minds to deeply examine and thoroughly eliminate those negative emotions and habitual resistance. If they are unwilling to eliminate them automatically and consciously, we must help them and fight against them. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary should have a very sincere, humble, upright and selfless style and character. At the same time, all people should give full play to their greatest enthusiasm, to further strengthen and improve the democratic life of our country, and to dedicate themselves to accelerating the construction of the great motherland - socialist construction.

### 消除一切阻力，活跃和健全民主生活

    消除一切阻力，活跃和健全民主生活
    鲁直
    最近时期，我们的党和我们的国家，在发扬与健全党内外的民主生活，开展批评与自我批评方面，出现了一片新气象。这种新气象，充分地表现在不久前召开的全国人民代表大会及各省党代表大会上。这种新气象是十分令人兴奋鼓舞的。因为正是依靠它，可以更好地激发与调动党内外的一切积极因素，去为伟大艰巨的社会主义建设做出更有成效的贡献。
    但是如果有谁认为要进一步健全民主生活，克服主观主义与官僚主义作风，将会一帆风顺而不需要进行坚韧的斗争，那就错了。在这里，我想特别提一下消除一切不利于健全民主生活的习惯阻力的必要性与重要性。
    仅仅在半年多以前，某同志由于响应党中央的关于反对右倾保守主义（以及主观经验主义）的号召，本着“知无不言、言无不尽”的精神，向某领导机关提出了对工作中某些问题的意见。提意见的动机无疑是善良的，意见的内容基本上也是恰当的，或值得参考的。对于这些意见，领导机关的负责人还是较为谦虚地郑重地受理了，许多同志也都认为提意见是正当的；但是周围一些同志对他这种举动怎样看待呢？你看吧：简直是七嘴八舌，群起而攻之，而难之。有的同志说：你所以提意见，是不是夹杂着某种个人情绪？你的动机何在？目的何在？一个同志讽刺说：哈，真不简单，不鸣则已，一鸣惊人！一个久别重逢的老同志更干脆地说：你是不是想出风头？这是所谓追究“动机”论。有的同志说：你还是先作好自己的工作吧，少管这些“闲事”，在这一方面我是有过多少经验呵，否则你会吃亏的。这叫做莫管“闲事”论。还有一些同志说：你的看法一定有很大的片面性，难道说你对情况能如此熟悉吗？必须慎重将事，总之你是欠考虑，有点冒失。又有的同志说：写报告是非常郑重的事情，你不要左一个报告，右一个报告，这样是会令人生厌的，即使你的动机善良，如果你所提内容不当，就不会对你有好处的。这又是一种“慎重”论和“权衡利害论”。更令人费解的是：一位负责同志竟大发雷霆追问道：你写这一厚本本准备给谁看！你对革命有什么贡献！
    对于这些形形色色的不利于正常民主生活的歪风与谬论，你能叫它什么呢？我想只能称它为顽固可恶的消极因素与习惯阻力。当然许多同志的这些言论，大多是出于无心的，自发的，而且有时还是出于爱护同志的立场，可是正因为这样，它就更为可怕了。
    事实很清楚，一个同志对工作中存在的问题提出自己的意见与看法，你不是满腔热忱地欢迎，反而首先追问人家的动机，这会产生一种什么结果呢？不用说没有个人动机在内，纵然夹杂着一些，难道说你应当首先询问动机而不看意见的内容是否正当吗？至于说莫管“闲事”论，这更是一种庸俗的论调。实际上就是要大家“独善其身”，不必“兼善天下”，因为，他们所说的“闲事”往往正是与自己无关，却于党于国于人民有关的大事，难道这样的“闲事”我们每一个革命者不应当过问吗？那么你的革命的正义感与责任感又表现在哪里呢？至于所谓你的看法欠全面或欠考虑的所谓“慎重”论，也许你自己认为或者旁人也曾认为你“老练、稳健、原则性强”，其实在大多数场合下，这不过是一种胆怯的消极的“取消主义”的遁词吧了。的确一个人提意见应当力求全面，有根有据，但是一个人的工作毕竟有着很大的局限性，事实上他很难做到更广泛、全面而具体的洞察与了解，这样，难道说根据自己有限的所知所见所闻，谈出自己的印象、观感与看法，不也是必要而有益的吗？说到那种处处从个人得失的角度出发的所谓“权衡利害论”，这更是卑鄙腐朽的思想，它与一个光明正大的革命者的品质是毫无共同之处的。至于所谓“你对革命有什么贡献”这样一种咄咄逼人的怪论，更加荒谬绝论，不屑一顾，因为这表现了一种典型的特权思想。
    上述这种形形色色的不利于民主生活的歪道理绝不能认为这在我们党和国家内只是个别的偶然的事例，勿宁说还具有一定的或多或少的普遍的典型意义。即使根据人民日报上所刊载过的许许多多的例子中，也完全可以说明，目前在我们的党和国家内，由于党与政府的大声疾呼与坚决的反对，那种敢于公开压制正当批评的现象已经大大地少见了，但是那种不爱听批评甚至变象压制、给以种种冷遇、责难以及各种各样的不利于民主生活的言论与作风，还是不少的。这些顽固可恶的消极因素与习惯阻力，最近它们的市场虽然越来越狭窄，但是它还没有得到彻底的有力的清算与纠正。
    问题很清楚，由于我们社会制度的优越性，宪法和党章的规定，保证了我们党内和全体公民的最基本的民主生活。问题在于我们不满足已有的现状，我们要进一步发扬与健全我们的可贵的民主生活，以便于更好地发挥一切积极因素，防止和纠正错误缺点的产生。我们的可敬的古人训诫我们说：“兼听则明，偏听则暗”。伟大的列宁教导我们说：在无产阶级取得政权以后，要特别当心新型的官僚主义的滋生及其危害。我们的领袖毛主席谆谆指示我们：批评者与被批评者应当“知无不言，言无不尽；言者无罪，闻者足戒；有则改之，无则加勉”。当此我们的党和政府正在大力加强党内外的民主生活之际，具有种种不利于民主生活的言论与作风的人们应当猛醒：是要下决心深刻检查并彻底消除那些消极情绪与习惯阻力的时候了。如果他们不愿意自动自觉地消除，我们就要给他们帮助、同他们斗争。我们每一个共产党员与革命者，都应当具备非常诚恳、谦虚、正直无私的作风与品格。同时一切人们，都应当发挥自己最大的积极性，为进一步加强与健全我国的民主生活，为了发挥一切积极因素去为加速伟大的祖国的建设——社会主义的建设而献身努力。
