The new semester is approaching, and the graduates of this year's three-year postgraduate program in Marxist-Leninist fundamentals at one university have not yet been assigned jobs.

The previous method of teaching Marxist-Leninist fundamentals chapter by chapter and section by section is no longer feasible. How should it be taught in the future? The old teachers are worried, and the new teachers are even more at a loss.

The Party Central Committee put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and then calls appeared in the newspapers against reading manuscripts in universities, which is a good thing. These graduates, who are waiting quietly for job assignments, had already opposed the learning method of "taking notes in class, comparing notes after class, moving notes in classroom discussions, and reciting notes for exams" as early as 1953. Several people had repeatedly raised opinions to the school leadership, but at that time, one of the school leaders said: "It's not that you know too many details, but that you know too few or too little details." As a result, the struggle against dogmatic learning methods was shelved.

In the school, according to the prevailing trend of the past few years, postgraduates began to collect lecture notes from Marxist-Leninist majors across the country in the year before graduation. In order to collect these lecture notes, the students established various contacts in the local area and other places. In order to purchase and reprint these lecture notes, they often spared no expense, in order to "draw a ladle according to the gourd" when they become teachers after graduation.

In the past, as long as the graduates had several sets of lecture notes, they would happily take up their posts as soon as the job assignment list was published, and step into another university to become teaching assistants or lecturers. This time, however, it is different. Carrying piles and bundles of lecture notes cannot make the play a success, because the slogan of a hundred schools of thought contending is so loud, and the opposition to reading lecture notes is a common sentiment.

Shouldn't we now learn from the lessons of reading lecture notes, overcome dogmatism, and make "flowers bloom" and "birds sing"?

    照着葫芦也画不成瓢了
    冰
    新学年快到了，一个大学的马克思列宁主义基础专业本届毕业的三年制研究生的工作还没有分配。
    以往那种按章按节讲授马克思列宁主义基础的办法是不行了。今后如何教呢？老教员在发愁，新教员更是没办法。
    党中央提出了百花齐放和百家争鸣的方针，接着报上出现了反对在高等学校念讲稿的呼声，这是好事。这些正在静候分配工作的毕业生，在1953年老早就反对“上课记笔记，下课对笔记，课堂讨论搬笔记，考试背笔记”的学习方法。有好几个人曾经一再向学校领导方面提过意见，可是，当时学校负责人之一说：“你们不是条条儿知道得太多，而是条条儿知道得不多或者太少”。于是反对教条主义学习方法的斗争便搁浅下来了。
    在学校里，按照几年来相袭的风气，研究生在毕业的前一年，就开始搜罗全国各地马克思列宁主义专业的讲稿。同学们为了搜罗这些讲稿，在本埠、外埠建立了各种联系，为了购买和翻印这些讲稿，往往是不惜工本，为的是在毕业以后当教员的时候“依照葫芦好画瓢”。
    历届毕业生只要具备了几套讲稿，工作分配名单一发表，便欣然就道，跨进另一所大学去当助教或讲师去了；这次却不然，背上成堆成捆的讲稿，并不能把戏唱成，因为百家争鸣的口号如此响亮，反对念讲稿又是人同此心。
    现在难道还不应该接受念讲稿的教训，克服教条主义，使“花开”“鸟鸣”起来吗？
