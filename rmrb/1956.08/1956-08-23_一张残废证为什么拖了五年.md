Why Did a Disability Certificate Take Five Years?
Zhang Liqun, Deputy Director of the People's Reception Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

    Revolutionary disabled soldier Zheng Dianzhang lost his disability certificate and applied to the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section for a replacement. This matter should have been easily resolved. However, the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section created all kinds of difficulties and refused to reissue it. Later, Zheng Dianzhang questioned them, further angering the cadres of the Preferential Treatment Section, who then further attacked and framed Zheng Dianzhang. In order to find proof to replace his disability certificate and to lodge complaints, Zheng Dianzhang went to the Central South region three times and to Beijing five times, visiting Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, and other provinces, as well as Liaoyang, Andong, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other cities, and contacting more than a dozen local and central government agencies. However, after more than five years, the problem was not resolved; instead, he was detained five times and imprisoned for two years and five months. Only this year was the matter properly handled.
    Revolutionary disabled soldier Zheng Dianzhang joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in September 1945 when Northeast China was liberated, serving as a scout and deputy squad leader of a scout squad. In the winter of 1947, he was shot in the ear during the battle of Tonglue Fort in Anshan, resulting in a second-class B disability. He was demobilized in the spring of 1949. He first lived in Andong City, then moved to Liaoyang City. In July of the same year, he was introduced to live in Shenyang City by the Liaoyang Civil Affairs Section. After arriving in Shenyang, Zheng Dianzhang even received a disability allowance from the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau once. In the winter of 1950, Zheng Dianzhang lost his disability certificate. He described the circumstances of the loss to Li Jinghua, a cadre of the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section, and suggested, "The bureau still has the transfer introduction letter and the stub for receiving disability allowance, which can serve as proof." However, Li Jinghua did not consider the evidence provided by Zheng Dianzhang and simply replied, "Proof from the original unit is required before a replacement can be issued." Soon, Zheng Dianzhang found a personal certificate from Ren Guoguang, a reconnaissance staff officer from his original unit, in Shenyang. Li Jinghua told Zheng, "Personal certificates are invalid." Zheng immediately questioned Li Jinghua, "Why are they invalid?" Li Jinghua said, "They are just invalid. What can you do? Proof from a political organ above the division level of the unit is required before a replacement can be issued." In fact, the government had not made such a regulation.
    In order to replace his disability certificate, Zheng Dianzhang had no choice but to find "proof from a political organ above the division level of the unit." In the spring of 1951, Zheng Dianzhang traveled from Shenyang to Liujiang County, Guangxi, to find Zhang Zaokai, the former operations section chief of his original unit (Zhang was then the county magistrate of Liujiang), to provide proof of his identity so that he could find the former Central South Military Region to issue a letter of introduction. On the way, Zheng Dianzhang was detained by the military police and sent to the military law department of the former Central South Military Region because he was wearing a military uniform without documents. The military law department inquired about Zheng's situation with the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau. The bureau replied, "The situation of Zheng Dianzhang is unclear." As a result, Zheng Dianzhang was detained for eight months before being released based on proof from the police station in Shenyang where Zheng Dianzhang resided. Therefore, after returning to Shenyang, Zheng questioned Li Jinghua and Zhang Tinghan, cadres of the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section: "I received disability allowance from your bureau, and I applied to your bureau for a replacement after losing my disability certificate. Why did you say that my situation was unclear?" This questioning only made the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section's impression of Zheng Dianzhang even worse. In 1952, Zheng, unable to replace his certificate and without money, ate a meal in the North Market of Shenyang City without paying and was sentenced to labor reform for eight months by the judicial organs.
    In the summer of 1953, Zheng Dianzhang went to the Central South Military Region again to find proof. The military law department of the Central South Military Region contacted Zheng's original unit and confirmed that "Zheng Dianzhang is indeed a revolutionary disabled soldier," and wrote a letter of proof for Zheng Dianzhang, asking him to request the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau to reissue his disability certificate. However, the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau further attacked Zheng Dianzhang, using the excuse that "Zheng Dianzhang is of poor character, has consistently defrauded food, and has been dealt with by the government several times," and sent Zheng to the Beishi District Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the District People's Court for detention in August 1953. In order to find a basis for sentencing Zheng Dianzhang, the Civil Affairs Bureau sent letters to Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Jinzhou, Yingkou, the military law department of the Central South Military Region, and other places to collect Zheng's "misdeeds." During this period, the military law department of the Central South Military Region also directly informed the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau that "Zheng Dianzhang is indeed a veteran and should be issued a replacement disability certificate and be resettled." However, the Civil Affairs Bureau still compiled some incomplete and untrue materials and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the District Court. The District Court sentenced Zheng Dianzhang to eight months of imprisonment based on these materials.
    In August 1954, Zheng Dianzhang went south again to find the Central South Military Region to help solve the problem of replacing his disability certificate. While passing through Xinxiang County, Henan, he was detained by the local government for three months because he had no money to pay for his meals. He was later released with proof from the military law department of the Central South Military Region and sent back to Shenyang City in January 1955 and handed over to the Public Security Bureau. The City Public Security Bureau immediately contacted the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section for handling, but the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section refused to take responsibility. The Public Security Bureau treated Zheng Dianzhang as a social vagrant and sent him to a labor re-education camp for fifty-seven days.
    During these more than five years, Zheng Dianzhang appealed to the former Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal People's Court, the former Northeast Civil Affairs Bureau, the Northeast People's Procuratorate, and relevant central government agencies, requesting support. He went to the Shenyang Municipal Committee several times. The Municipal Committee still handed over his application to the Civil Affairs Bureau for handling. Although they also asked to solve Zheng's food and lodging problems, the Civil Affairs Bureau never solved them. When Zheng Dianzhang went to the Municipal Committee again, the Municipal Committee did not pursue the matter. Zheng Dianzhang went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs five times. In 1953, the visiting section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs studied Zheng Dianzhang's problem when He Tong, the head of the Preferential Treatment Section of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau, came to Beijing to report on his work, and instructed that it be handled as soon as possible. The Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in August of the same year, saying: "Zheng Dianzhang defrauds food and money and is of poor character. The issue of replacing his disability certificate has not been resolved because the procedures are not in compliance." In April 1954, the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent another letter to the former Northeast Civil Affairs Bureau for investigation. The Northeast Civil Affairs Bureau then instructed the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau to handle it. At this time, He Tong, the head of the Preferential Treatment Section of the bureau, still sarcastically said to Zheng Dianzhang: "Zheng Dianzhang, you went to Central South and Beijing, your problem has not been solved, has it? I am still the head of the section, am I? I can afford to lose this position as the head of the section; can’t I compensate you, Zheng Dianzhang!" Later, when Zheng Dianzhang went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs again to request support, the cadres in the visiting section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, based on the report from the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau, not only did not handle it but also said that he was "impersonating a disabled soldier" and refused to deal with it. Zheng Dianzhang then appealed to the State Council. The reception office of the State Council introduced him to the Ministry of Supervision. After contacting the Ministry of Internal Affairs by telephone, the comrades who received him at the Ministry of Supervision neither listened to Zheng Dianzhang's complaint in detail nor analyzed the nature of the problem. They simply said, "Replacing the disability certificate is the responsibility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and we are not in a position to handle it." As a result, it was not accepted. In order to seek a solution to the problem, Zheng Dianzhang appealed to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in April 1955. At this time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent people to investigate for eight months, confirming that Zheng Dianzhang was indeed a disabled soldier, re-evaluated his rank as second-class A, reissued his disability certificate and disability allowance, dealt with the personnel who had wrongly handled this problem, and asked the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee to be responsible for Zheng Dianzhang's resettlement.
    Now the problem of Zheng Dianzhang has been finally handled by the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee. Because Zheng Dianzhang was detained and imprisoned several times, his health was damaged, and his eyes were about to go blind. He was sent to the Affiliated Hospital of the China Medical University in Shenyang for treatment. The Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau and the relevant personnel responsible for this incident have made self-criticisms. He Tong, the head of the Preferential Treatment Section, has been dismissed, and the relevant personnel in the section have also received the punishment they deserve. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has issued a notice to the civil affairs departments in various regions regarding this incident, and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee has also notified the entire province, requiring people's committees at all levels to conscientiously convey the information in relevant departments, and to comprehensively and thoroughly check the preferential treatment work in conjunction with the current demobilization and resettlement work.
    In addition, Zheng Dianzhang does have many shortcomings and mistakes in his words, actions, and daily life, such as alcoholism, gambling, a violent temper, frequent quarrels with people, falsely reporting his military service years, and falsely reporting his place of origin. Therefore, the local government should often educate Zheng Dianzhang. Zheng Dianzhang should also cherish his glorious history and strictly abide by discipline.
    Zheng Dianzhang's application for a replacement disability certificate was originally a very simple matter, but it was only because of the bureaucracy of certain organs, listening to only one side of the story, especially certain cadres of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Bureau, who were initially irresponsible, and then deliberately created difficulties and engaged in attacks and frame-ups based on preconceived notions, that the problem could not be resolved for a long time, causing serious damage to the prestige of the Party and the government. We should learn a lesson from this incident.

    一张残废证为什么拖了五年
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会办公厅人民接待室副主任　张力群
    革命残废军人郑殿章遗失了残废证，向沈阳市民政局优抚科申请补发。这件事本来是很容易解决的。但沈阳市民政局优抚科却百般刁难，不予补发。以后，郑殿章提出了质问，更触怒了优抚科的干部，他们便进一步对郑殿章进行打击陷害。郑殿章为了寻找补领残废证的证明和进行控告，曾三次到中南地区，五次到北京，先后到过河北、河南、广西等省和辽阳、安东、武汉、广州等市，找过地方的和中央的十几个机关，但是经过五年多的长时间，问题却没有得到解决，反而五次被扣押，坐监两年又五个月。一直到今年，这件事才得到正确处理。
    革命残废军人郑殿章，1945年9月东北解放时参加中国人民解放军，曾当侦察员和侦察班副班长。1947年冬，在鞍山铜略堡战斗中耳部中弹，致成二等乙级残废，1949年春复员。先住安东市，后到辽阳市，同年七月由辽阳市民政科介绍到沈阳市居住。郑殿章到沈阳后还曾在沈阳市民政局领过一次残废金。1950年冬，郑殿章遗失了残废证，他向民政局优抚科的干部李景华叙述了遗失经过，并提出“局里尚有转移介绍信和领取残废金的存根可以做证。”但是李景华并没有考虑郑殿章所提的证据，就简单地答复“需要有原部队的证明，才能补发”。不久郑殿章在沈阳找来原部队侦察参谋任国光的个人证明，李景华对郑说“个人证明无效”。郑即质问李景华“为什么无效。”李景华说“就是无效，你怎么样呢？须有部队师以上政治机关的证明，才给补发”。事实上，政府并没有这样规定过。
    郑殿章为了补领残废证，只好去找“部队师以上政治机关的证明”。1951年春，郑殿章由沈阳到广西柳江县找原部队的作战科长张造凯（张当时是柳江县长），为他做身份证明，以便找前中南军区开证明信件。在途中，郑殿章因身着军服无证件，被部队押送前中南军区军法处。军法处向沈阳市民政局询问郑的情况，该局答复“对郑殿章问题不清楚”。因此郑殿章被扣押八个月后，才由沈阳市郑殿章所在的派出所证明释放。为此，郑殿章返沈后向民政局优抚科干部李景华、张廷汉提出质问：“我在你局领过残废金，残废证遗失后并向你局申请补发，为何你们说对我的问题不清楚？”这种质问换来的是民政局优抚科对郑殿章的印象越发坏了。1952年，郑由于补证不得，手中无钱，在沈阳市北市场吃了饭没有付钱，被司法机关劳动改造了八个月。
    1953年夏天，郑殿章又去中南军区找证明。中南军区军法处同郑原在部队联系，证实“郑殿章确是革命残废军人”，即给郑殿章写了证明信。让他向沈阳市民政局要求补发残废证。可是沈阳市民政局反而进一步对郑殿章实行打击，以“郑殿章品质恶劣、一贯骗食，曾被政府处理过几次”等为借口，于1953年8月将郑送北市区公安分局转区人民法院扣押。为找给郑殿章判刑的根据，民政局并向辽阳、辽中、锦州、营口、中南军区军法处等地发信搜集郑的“劣迹”。在这期间，中南军区军法处也直接函告沈阳市民政局说“郑殿章确实是荣军，希望补发残废证，并进行安置”。可是民政局仍把搜集到的一些不完全真实的材料综合后交公安分局转区法院。区法院就根据这些材料判了郑殿章八个月徒刑。
    1954年8月，郑殿章为找中南军区协助解决补领残废证问题，再度南下。在路过河南新乡县时，因吃饭无钱付饭费，被当地政府扣押了三个月，以后经中南军区军法处证明释放，于1955年1月送回沈阳市交给公安局。市公安局即和市民政局优抚科联系处理，而民政局优抚科推脱不管，公安局即把郑殿章当作社会游民送劳动教养所改造了五十七天。
    在这长达五年多的岁月中，郑殿章曾向前沈阳市人民政府、中共沈阳市委会、市人民法院，原东北民政局、东北人民检察署以及中央有关机关申诉，请求支持。他前后到沈阳市委会数次，市委将他的申请仍交民政局处理，虽然也叫解决郑的食宿问题，但民政局一直不予解决。郑殿章又去找市委会时，市委也未予追究。郑殿章前后到过内务部五次，内务部来访科1953年曾就沈阳市民政局优抚科长贺统来京汇报工作时，顺便研究了郑殿章的问题，并指示从速处理。沈阳市民政局于同年八月间向内务部报告说：“郑殿章骗食骗财，品质恶劣，补发残废证问题，因手续不合，没有补发。”1954年4月内务部又函请原东北民政局清查。东北民政局又责成沈阳市民政局处理。这时该局优抚科长贺统仍然对郑殿章讽刺说：“郑殿章你上中南上北京，你的问题没有解决还是没有解决吧！我科长还是科长吧！我拚这个科长不干，还赔不起你郑殿章吗！”以后郑殿章再到内务部请求支持时，内务部来访科接见他的干部根据沈阳市民政局的报告，不但不予处理，反说他是“冒充残废军人”，推出不管。郑殿章随又到国务院申诉，国务院接待室介绍他到监察部，监察部接见他的同志用电话和内务部联系后，既不详细听取郑殿章的申诉，也不分析问题的性质，便简单地说：“补发残废证问题是内务部的事情，我们不好处理。”结果未予受理。郑殿章为了求得问题的解决，又于1955年4月向全国人民代表大会常务委员会申诉。这时，才由内务部派人经过八个月的调查，证实郑殿章确实是残废军人，给他重新评定了等级为二等甲级，补发了残废证和残废金，对错误处理这个问题的人员作了处理，并请辽宁省人民委员会对郑殿章负责安置。
    现在郑殿章的问题已由辽宁省人民委员会做了最后的处理。郑殿章由于几次被扣押坐狱，身体受到摧残，双目将要失明，曾被送入沈阳中国医科大学附属医院治疗。沈阳市民政局和有关人员对这一事件应负的责任，都已做了检讨，优抚科长贺统已被撤职，科内有关人员也受到了应得的处分。内务部已就这一事件向各地民政部门发出通报，辽宁省人民委员会也通报全省，要求各级人民委员会在有关部门认真进行传达，并结合当前复员安置工作，全面深入地检查优抚工作。
    另外郑殿章在言语行动和日常生活上确实存在着不少的缺点和错误，如酗酒、赌钱、性格暴躁、常同人争吵、虚报军龄、假报籍贯等。因此，当地政府对郑殿章应经常进行教育。郑殿章也要珍惜自己的光荣历史，切实遵守纪律。
    郑殿章申请补发残废证，本来是一个很简单的问题，只是因为某些机关的官僚主义，偏听偏信，特别是沈阳市民政局某些干部，初则不负责任，继则从成见出发，故意刁难进行打击陷害，致使问题长期得不到解决，使党和政府的威信遭受到严重的损失。我们应该从这一事件中吸取教训。
