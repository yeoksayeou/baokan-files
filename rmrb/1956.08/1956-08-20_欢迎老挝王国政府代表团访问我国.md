    Welcome the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos to Visit Our Country
    The Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, led by Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, has arrived in our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of our government. The Chinese people warmly welcome the distinguished guests from afar.
    China and Laos are neighboring countries with a long history of friendship. The people of the two countries have had economic and cultural ties since ancient times. In the Middle Ages, Laos appeared in Southeast Asia as a country with a brilliant civilization. At that time, messengers between China and Laos traveled back and forth frequently, leaving many touching records of friendship. In modern history, the scourge of colonialism once hindered our friendly ties; however, the people of the two countries, with their common aspirations for peace, safeguarding their respective national independence, and opposing colonialism, have come closer together again. Now, both China and Laos, after a long struggle for national independence, have once again taken control of their own national destiny. Although the paths we have taken in the past are different, and our current social systems are also different, mutual contact at the Bandung Conference has proved that our two countries, like all Asian and African countries, have many common aspirations and common interests. These common aspirations and interests have laid the foundation for the restoration and development of friendly relations between our two countries.
    Our government has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy and is willing to establish normal relations with all countries in the world, especially hoping to establish friendly and good-neighborly relations with Asian countries. Our country and India, Burma, and other countries advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in international relations. Our government and people actively support and abide by the Ten Principles adopted by the Asian-African Conference to guide peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries. The people of our country believe that all countries, regardless of differences in political systems, regardless of size or strength, are completely equal in international affairs, and on the basis of peaceful coexistence, can establish friendly relations of mutual respect and mutual assistance. Based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, our country has long established normal diplomatic relations with India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and other countries in Asia, and has recently established friendly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia. Similarly, the people of our country sincerely hope to establish and develop friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos.
     The Kingdom of Laos contributed to the success of the Bandung Conference. The Royal Government has repeatedly expressed its support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. Recently, in the joint communiqué issued at the Vientiane talks, Prime Minister Phouma explicitly announced that the Kingdom of Laos pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, and will establish friendly relations with all countries, especially its neighbors, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the Kingdom of Laos will not join any military alliance and will not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on Lao territory. These policies of the Government of the Kingdom of Laos have been valued and welcomed by the Chinese people.
    More and more facts prove that the pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality by Asian and African countries, that is, the pursuit of an independent and autonomous foreign policy of not participating in military blocs and rejecting foreign interference, is a major contribution to maintaining world peace. The implementation of this policy will prevent the expansion of war forces, and will prevent colonial countries from undermining the unity of Asian and African countries, creating division and opposition among Asian and African countries, and intensifying international tensions. Premier Zhou Enlai recently said: "Many countries in the world that do not participate in military blocs, especially countries in the Asian and African regions, actively participate in international affairs and greatly strengthen the forces for international peace." As a result of the pursuit of peaceful and independent policies by many Asian and African countries, their international status is rising, they have more and more friends, and their domestic unity is also increasing day by day. Colonial countries can no longer easily bully them. It can be seen that pursuing a policy of peace and independence is beneficial to Asian and African countries in every way. The Chinese people sincerely wish the Kingdom of Laos prosperity and strength on the basis of pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, and play an increasingly important role in the international family of the Asian-African peace region, and in the cause of maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia.
    There is no doubt that this friendly visit to China by the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, headed by Prince Phouma, is a good opportunity to promote mutual understanding and trust between China and Laos. The people of our country are doing their best to build their own country in order to get rid of the economic backwardness left over by the long-term scourge of colonialism. We urgently need a peaceful international environment, and we also need the mutual cooperation and mutual care of friendly countries to promote each other's construction. We hope that we will make progress, and we also hope that all Asian countries will develop. We have sincere goodwill towards all our Asian neighbors. Our country and Laos have many common requirements and aspirations in terms of maintaining peace and developing our own economic and cultural construction, so we can help each other in many ways. We hope that Prime Minister Phouma and the distinguished guests of the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos can see what they want to see, learn what they want to learn, and lay a good foundation for the establishment and development of friendly relations between China and Laos during their visit to our country, and make valuable contributions to expanding the Asian peace region and maintaining world peace.

    欢迎老挝王国政府代表团访问我国
    老挝王国首相富马亲王率领的老挝王国政府代表团，应我国政府的邀请已来到我国进行友好访问。中国人民热烈地欢迎远道来访的贵宾们。
    中国和老挝是具有长久历史友谊的邻邦。两国人民很早以来就有经济和文化的联系。在中世纪，老挝就以一个光辉灿烂的文明国家出现在东南亚，那时中国和老挝两国之间的信使已往来不绝，留下了许多动人的友好记录。在近代历史上，殖民主义的祸害曾使我们之间的友好联系受到阻碍；但是两国人民在争取和平，维护各自民族独立和反对殖民主义的共同愿望下，又重新接近起来。现在，中国和老挝两国经过长期的争取民族独立的斗争，都已经重新掌握了自己的民族命运。我们两国虽然过去所走的道路不一样，现在的社会制度也不同，但是，在万隆会议上的相互接触证明，我们两国之间，如同所有亚非各国之间一样，有着许多共同的愿望和共同的利害关系。这些共同的愿望和利益，奠定了我们两国之间恢复和发展友好关系的基础。
    我国政府一向奉行和平外交政策，愿意同世界上一切国家建立正常的关系，特别是希望同亚洲各国建立友好睦邻的关系。我国同印度、缅甸等国倡导在国际关系中实行和平共处的五项原则，我国政府和人民积极地支持和遵守亚非会议所通过的指导亚非各国间的和平相处、友好合作的十项原则。我国人民认为，一切国家不问政治制度的异同，不分大小强弱，在国际事务中都是完全平等的，在和平共处的基础上，都是能够建立起相互尊重和相互帮助的友好关系的。根据和平共处的原则，我国在亚洲早已同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦等国建立正常外交关系，新近又同柬埔寨王国建立了友好关系。同样地，我国人民也衷心地期望同老挝王国建立和发展友好关系。
    老挝王国是对于万隆会议的成功作出了贡献的国家之一。王国政府对于和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则，曾经一再表示予以支持。最近，在万象会谈所发表的联合公报中，富马首相又明确地宣布，老挝王国奉行和平中立政策，并将根据和平共处的五项原则，同各国、特别是各邻国建立友好的关系；老挝王国将不加入任何军事联盟，不容许在老挝领土上建立外国军事基地。老挝王国政府的这些政策，受到了中国人民的重视和欢迎。
    越来越多的事实证明，亚非国家奉行和平中立政策，也就是奉行不参加军事集团和拒绝外国干涉的独立自主的外交政策，是对于维护世界和平的重大贡献。实行这种政策，就会阻止战争势力的扩张，就会使得殖民国家想要破坏亚非国家的团结、制造亚非国家的分裂和对立以加剧国际紧张局势的图谋不能得逞。周恩来总理最近说：“世界上不参加军事集团的许多国家，特别是亚非地区的国家，积极地参加国际事务，大大地加强了国际和平力量。”许多亚非国家奉行和平独立政策的结果，它们的国际地位日益提高，朋友越来越多，国内团结也日见增进。殖民国家对它们再也不能轻易加以欺侮了。由此可见，奉行和平独立政策对于亚非国家来说，是有百利而无一弊的。中国人民衷心地祝愿老挝王国在奉行和平中立政策的基础上，在亚非和平地区的国际大家庭里走向繁荣昌盛，并为维护印度支那和亚洲和平的事业发挥越来越大的作用。
    毫无疑问的，以富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府代表团这次到中国作友好访问，是促进中国和老挝的互相了解和信任的一个很好的机会。我国人民正在以全力建设自己的国家，以摆脱因长期的殖民主义祸害所遗留下的经济上的落后状态。我们迫切需要一个和平的国际环境，也需要友好国家的相互合作和相互关怀来促进彼此的建设。我们希望自己进步，也希望亚洲各国都得到发展。对于所有亚洲的邻邦，我们都怀着诚挚的善意。我国和老挝在关于维护和平和发展自己的经济文化建设方面，有着许多共同的要求和愿望，因此我们在许多地方可以互相帮助。我们希望，富马首相和老挝王国政府代表团的各位贵宾在访问我国期间，能够看到他们所愿意看的，能够了解到他们所愿意了解的，并且为建立和发展中国和老挝两国的友好关系打下一个良好的基础，为扩大亚洲和平地区和维护世界和平的事业作出有价值的贡献。
