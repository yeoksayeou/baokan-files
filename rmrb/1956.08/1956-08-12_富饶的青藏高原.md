The Abundant Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

Iron Sand Roads, Piles of Coal

From Naqitai to Amdo Maima, this area of ​​six to seven hundred kilometers in radius is the central part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From this area to the four edges of the Great Plateau, it is more than a thousand kilometers. Many people think this is a "barren area" where no one lives for miles. In fact, this is a treasure house of the motherland.

When we passed through this "barren area", we walked on a "railway" near the hot springs. The so-called railway is not a railway with rails for trains, but a section of highway paved with iron ore sand. There, iron ore outcrops are visible everywhere. By slightly opening the surface soil, iron ore sand can be seen. Mu Shengzhong, director of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureau, said that he had shown the iron ore sand there to experts, and the experts believed that it contained a lot of iron. Some of it could be directly smelted into steel in an open-hearth furnace without going through a blast furnace. When we passed Uli, we saw piles of coal. Coal outcrops can also be seen on the ground in that area. It is said that there is also a coal mine 20 kilometers north of the Tongtian River. Tongtian River and Uli are north of the Xiao Tanggula Mountains, and the hot springs are south of the mountains. Uli is 204 kilometers away from the hot springs, and Tongtian River is only 108 kilometers away from the hot springs. Such close proximity of iron and coal production areas is an ideal place for developing industry.

The Tibetan region is full of Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine transgression areas. Unlike the Paleozoic Kunlun Mountains, this area is full of microfossil remains, which is the main source of petroleum. Therefore, Tibet has abundant oil shale and asphalt (oil seepages). In addition, the rock formations of the major mountain ranges in Tibet have been more or less metamorphosed, and the Cenozoic faults and fractures are particularly severe. This is another major condition for Tibet to have abundant mineral resources. Preliminary exploration has revealed hundreds of mineral deposits, including more than 30 kinds of useful minerals. Several scientists traveling with us unanimously believed that if Tibet is developed, it may become a heavy industrial base like the Urals in the Soviet Union.

Tibet may also have many rare metals that are rare in the interior of the motherland. We also brought back some mineral samples from Gyantse. Because we do not know the composition, Comrade Zou Jiayou has sent them to the Ministry of Geology for reference. On April 30, at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Sun Yunzhu, Wu Jue Nong and I reported this situation to representatives from all walks of life in Tibet in a joint congratulatory speech, and it was valued by them. Later, Liu Xia · Tubdeng Dagba and Losang Wangdui told me, "I never thought that Tibet had such development prospects. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the unanimous support of all ethnic groups can we develop it."

Fertile Grasslands, Herds of Wild Animals

In the past, we mostly believed that the plateau is a combination of mountains, with many mountains and little flat land. There may be some minerals, but the land is not necessarily fertile.

In reality, it is not like that. The plateau is flat land, so it is said: "From a distance, it looks like mountains; up close, it looks like plains (ie, flat land)." Even between the big mountains, there are many vast basins and large lawns. From Naqitai to the Yarlung Zangbo River, I passed many large grasslands and mountain basins. The soil there is very similar to the soil in the Soviet black earth belt. It also contains black organic matter and is rich in lime. The soil layer is two to three feet thick, and the fine roots combine the soil into one piece. Road construction workers dug the soil into pieces and placed it next to the highway as a route marker. There are many voles in the soil, some weighing two or three pounds. From the car, we often saw voles on both sides of the road, sticking their heads out of their holes.

After crossing the Bayan Har Mountains all the way to Heihe, wild animals such as wild horses, wild cattle, wild sheep, deer, wolves, etc. were found in many places along the way. Near the Tuotuo River, wild animals were in groups. Several fawns lingered on the highway, Qing wolves squatted on the side of the road, watching the cars come and go, and wild sheep scattered on the hillside to graze. This is what I saw with my own eyes. According to road construction workers, wild cattle, weighing about a thousand pounds, often hit the car with their heads, refusing to let it move forward.

In these basins and grasslands, we saw dissolved glacial water flowing down from the mountains everywhere. Some of it became small rivers, and some of it flowed across the ground. I got out of the car and carefully examined the color of the water. Some of it was grayish-green, and some of it was grayish-white or grayish-black. This is because the areas through which the snow water flows contain different amounts of rotten organic matter and lime. Therefore, I concluded that even on the mountains or hillsides, there is also the same fertile soil.

The fact is indeed like this. In the southern part of Qinghai Province, the large mountains we passed were all soil-quality grass mountains, with occasional rocks. The snow water rivers in the valleys were also gray, not clear. This is probably the Paleozoic mountain range, because after hundreds of millions of years of sunshine, rain, and wind, the surface rocks have weathered.

Even from Lhasa to Shigatse, the two Mesozoic mountains passed on the road—Mount Xugela and R惹拉—mostly do not have exposed rocks on the mountains, but are covered by a one- to two-foot-thick layer of brown soil. Fine grass also grows on the soil, as well as creeping pine (ie, the raw material for making Tibetan incense). Under the soil layer is sandy soil and rocks. This structure is particularly clear where the highway passes, because the soil layer has been removed.

These places are good places for developing animal husbandry. Areas below 4,400 meters above sea level can also develop agriculture. The plateau already has yaks and sheep suitable for the local natural conditions. I saw that the yak's hair was more than a foot long, and the sheep's hair was more than five inches long. If we further improve pastures, organize grazing, and develop, the prospects are great.

Thriving Qing稞, Delicious Vegetables

Many comrades may not know, or may not believe, that agriculture can be developed on a plateau at an altitude of 4,000 meters. In fact, in the valleys we passed, such as the Lhasa River, the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the Nyang Chu River, there is already a considerable development of agriculture and individual water conservancy irrigation projects. After liberation, agricultural experimental farms were established in Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo and other places, and wasteland was also reclaimed in Gyantse, Ali, Dingqing, Bomi and other places. In addition to the original crops in Tibet, there are also 24 kinds of crops, 33 kinds of vegetables, and 7 kinds of fruit trees that have been successfully trial-planted there. The lotus white cabbage grown there weighs more than 20 pounds each, and potatoes yield more than 6,000 pounds per mu. When the central delegation visited the farm, Tibetan workers Baima Yixi and others presented the fresh vegetables they grew, such as tomatoes, green peppers, radishes, and Chinese cabbage, to Vice Premier Chen Yi. Vice Premier Chen Yi personally planted apple seedlings brought by the delegation from Beijing in the soil, and said to a Tibetan youth: "I hope it will live for ten thousand years."

Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter in One Day

The air on the plateau is thin. At an altitude of 5,000 meters, the air is half as thin as at sea level. Moreover, the climate varies greatly in one day. South of Naqitai, it is very cold in the morning and evening, and it is as cold as winter in the tent. At noon, the sun is very strong, and it feels like summer. The west wind is very strong every afternoon. We lived in Naqitai on April 9th. The lowest temperature at night was minus 2.5 degrees Celsius. On the 10th, we lived in the Chumar River, and the temperature at night was minus 19 degrees Celsius. On the 11th, we lived in the Tuotuo River, and the temperature at night was minus 11 degrees Celsius. On the 12th, we lived at the Wenquan Station, and the temperature at night was minus 8 degrees Celsius. On the 13th, we lived in Amdo Maima, and the temperature at night was minus 11 degrees Celsius. On the 14th, we lived in Heihe, and the temperature at night was minus 7 degrees Celsius. These places are generally around 4,500 meters above sea level. When we first arrived, most of us had some physiological reactions. We all underwent strict health checks in Beijing, but no matter how strong you are, you will inevitably feel short of breath.

However, people are most adaptable to the environment. We had some reactions when we first arrived on the plateau, but we gradually got used to it after living there for a few days. In the so-called deserted area, we saw many pioneers, road construction workers and their tents. We felt short of breath with a slight movement, but they were doing heavy physical labor. We also met many heroic exploration team members who carried tools and climbed mountains and ridges there.

From Chaka Salt Lake all the way to Heihe, and in various parts of Tibet, we met many young men and women from all parts of the interior who responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to develop the western plateau of the motherland. Some are preparing to set up banks and post and telecommunications bureaus, some are setting up trading companies, and some are organizing medical institutions. I asked them if they were used to the local climate. They all said they were used to it. In fact, it is indeed the case.

Personally, I am older and come from the easternmost part of the motherland with the lowest altitude. Along the way, in addition to generally feeling that there was not enough oxygen and breathing was a little difficult, there were no other reactions. I was not exposed to the heat in the car with a temperature above 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) during the day, and I was not exposed to the cold in the tent with a temperature of minus 10 degrees (Celsius) at night. I did not have a fever for three months, and I did not feel dizzy or lightheaded after crossing several high mountains at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters. After living in Lhasa for more than 20 days, I felt that I had mostly adapted, but my appetite was slightly reduced. But when I went to Gyantse at a higher altitude, I ate and drank a lot because the food was in the northern style.

In Lanzhou, the doctor told us that when we first arrived on the plateau, it was best to be calm and slow. However, I often violated the doctor's instructions. Once, I went to the hot spring at an altitude of 4,880 meters. Because the scenery was so beautiful, the snowy peaks were overlapping above, forming several silver screens, and the warm water was gurgling below, flowing endlessly. We lived on the western hillside, facing the silver peaks, which was really moving. I was so happy that I ran around and explained the formation of the mountains to my friends. I was too excited and talked too much, and I felt dizzy for a while. I immediately ate two cloves of raw garlic, and it was fine. As for the young and strong comrades, some went up the mountain to bathe in the hot springs on the mountain, and some went down the river to wash their feet in the hot springs at the bottom of the river. Everyone was very happy. They had walked on the plateau for a few days and had already adapted.

What I said above is the highest part of the plateau, which is the pastoral area. As for the agricultural areas of Tibet, which are below 4,000 meters above sea level, it is easier to adapt to. Taking Lhasa and Shigatse as examples, Lhasa is 3,600 meters above sea level, which is more than twice as high as Mount Tai. Because of the latitude, the climate is similar to that of Beijing. It is not as cold as Beijing in winter and not as hot as Beijing in summer. It is also a suitable place to live. Although Shigatse is more than 3,800 meters above sea level, the climate is somewhat similar to my hometown of Caozhou, Shandong. When I arrived there, I felt at home because of the dirt roads in the suburbs and the houses where I lived.

    富饶的青藏高原
    何思原
    铁砂铺路，煤炭成堆
    自纳赤台到安多买马，这六七百公里方圆的地方是青藏高原的中心部分，从这一带到大高原的四缘，都有一千多公里。许多人认为，这是千里无人烟的“荒凉地区”。其实不然，这是祖国的一个宝库。
    我们经过这“荒凉地区”的时候，在温泉附近曾走了一段“铁路”。所谓铁路，不是通行火车的有轨铁路，乃是用铁矿砂铺起来的一段公路。那里，到处铁矿苗外露，把表面的泥土稍为掀开，就可看见铁矿砂。青藏公路局慕生忠局长说，他曾把那里的铁矿砂拿给专家看，专家认为含铁成分很多，有些可以不通过高炉，直接在平炉里炼出钢来。我们过乌丽时，看见煤炭成堆，那一带也是在地面上就可以看见露出的煤炭。听说通天河北二十公里处也有煤矿。通天河和乌丽在小唐古拉山以北，温泉在山南，乌丽离温泉二百零四公里，通天河到温泉只有一百零八公里，铁煤产地这样接近，是发展工业的理想地方。
    西藏境内到处是中生代和新生代的海浸地区，它和古生代昆仑山一带不同，这里充满了微体古生物的遗迹，这就是造成石油的主要源泉。所以，西藏有丰富的油页岩和沥青（油苗）。又西藏各大山脉的岩层或多或少地遭受了变质，新生代断层和断裂尤为剧烈。这又是造成西藏具有丰富矿产的主要条件。初步勘探出来的矿藏已有百处，包括三十多种有益矿物。同行的几位科学家都一致认为，如果西藏加以开发，可能成为像苏联的乌拉尔那样的重工业基地。
    西藏可能还有很多为祖国内地所少有的稀有金属。我们从江孜还带来一些矿苗，因为我们不知道成分，已由邹家尤同志送地质部参考。四月三十日我和孙云铸、吴觉农两位科学家在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上的联合祝词中，曾将这种情形报告给西藏各界代表，并得到他们的重视。后来，柳霞·土登塔巴和洛桑旺堆等告诉我说，“想不到西藏有这样的发展前途，这只有在中国共产党的领导下，得到各兄弟民族的一致支持，我们才能够开发出来。”
    肥草遍地，野兽成群
    我们以前多认为，高原既是群山的结合体，山多平地少，可能有些矿物，但土地不一定肥沃。
    实际上又不然。高原是平地，所以说：“远看是山，近看是川（即平地）”。即大山之间，也有许多广阔盆地和大块草坪。从纳赤台到雅鲁藏布江，我经过许多大草坪和山间盆地。那里的土壤很类似苏联黑土地带的土壤，也含有黑色有机物质，且富有石灰质。土层厚达二三尺，草细根长把土壤结合一块。修路工人把土掘成块，置于公路旁作为路线的标志。土内多田鼠，肥大的有二三斤重，在汽车上，我们常常看见两旁的田鼠，自穴中露出头来。
    过了巴颜喀喇山一直到黑河，沿途有许多地方发现野兽，如野马、野牛、野羊、鹿、狼等，在沱沱河附近，野兽成群，有几只小鹿在公路上徘徊不去，青狼蹲在路旁，看汽车往来，野羊散漫地在山坡上吃草，这是我亲眼看见的。又据修路工人说，常有野牛重约千斤，用头抵着汽车，硬是不让前进。
    在这些盆地和草坪上，我们到处看见山上流下来的溶解冰水，有的成为小河，有的在地面上漫流，我下车仔细察看水色，见有的发灰青色，有的发灰白色或灰黑色。这就是因为雪水流下所经过的地带，含有腐烂有机物和石灰质的多寡不同的缘故。因此，我断定即在山上或山坡上，也有同样的肥沃土地。
    事实的确是这样。在青海省南部，我们所经过的大山，都是土质草山，间有石块，山谷的雪水河也是灰色，而不是清水。这大概是古生代的山脉，因为经过几亿年日晒、雨淋、风吹，表面岩石已经风化了。
    即从拉萨到日喀则，路上经过那两座中生代的大山——旭格拉山和惹拉，山上也是大都看不见外露岩石，而是由一二尺厚的褐色土层复盖着。土上也长满细草，还有爬松（即制藏香的原材料），土层下是砂土乱石。这种构成，在公路经过处，因为已经将土层抛开，特别看得清楚。
    这些地方是发展牧畜业的好地方，海拔在四千四百公尺以下的地方，还可以发展农业。高原上已有适于当地自然条件的牦牛和绵羊，我看牦牛的毛有一尺多长，绵羊的毛也有五寸多。如果进一步改良牧草，组织放牧，发展前途是很大的。
    青稞茁壮，蔬菜鲜美
    可能有很多同志还不知道，或者还不相信，在海拔四千公尺的高原上，能够发展农业。其实，我们经过的地方，如拉萨河、雅鲁藏布江、年楚河等谷地，已有相当发展的农业和个别的水利灌溉工程，解放以后，又在拉萨、日喀则、昌都等地设立了农业试验场，在江孜、阿里区、丁青、波密等处也开垦了荒地。除了过去西藏原有几种作物外，那里又有二十四种农作物、三十三种蔬菜、七种果树，都已试种成功。那里试种出来的莲花白，一颗有二十多斤重，马铃薯每亩收获六千多斤。中央代表团参观农场时，藏族工人白马益西等把他们栽培的番茄，青椒，萝卜、白菜等新鲜菜蔬献给陈毅副总理，陈副总理又把代表团从北京带来的苹果树苗，亲手栽进土里，并对一位藏族青年说：“希望它活一万年。”
    一日之间，春夏秋冬
    高原上的空气稀薄，在海拔五千公尺的地方，空气比海平面稀薄一半，并且，一日之间气候差别很大。自纳赤台以南，早晚很冷，在帐篷内寒冷如冬，中午日照甚烈，又好像夏天。每天下午西风很大。我们四月九日住纳赤台，夜间最低温度是零下二度半，十日住楚马尔河，夜间温度为零下十九度，十一日住沱沱河，夜间为零下十一度，十二日住温泉站，夜间为零下八度，十三日住安多买马，夜间为零下十一度，十四日住黑河，夜间为零下七度。这些地方，一般皆在海拔四千五百公尺左右，初到时，生理上大都有些反应。我们在北京每个人都经过严格的健康检查，但是无论你多么健壮，都不免要感到呼吸急促的。
    但是，人是最能适应环境的，我们初到高原有些反应，但是稍住几日，即逐渐习惯。在所谓千里无人烟的地方，我们看见许多开路先锋，修路工人和他们住的帐篷。我们稍一动作，就气喘难受，而他们却在作繁重的体力劳动。我们还遇见许多英勇的勘探队员，他们抬带工具还在那里爬山越岭。
    自茶卡盐池一直到黑河，以及西藏各地，我们遇见许多来自内地各处的男女青年，他们是响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召来开发祖国西部高原的。有的在筹办银行，邮电局，有的在设立贸易公司，有的在组织医疗机构，我问他们对本地气候习惯不习惯，都说已经习惯了，事实上，确是这样。
    就我个人说，我是年岁比较大的，并且来自海拔最低的祖国最东部；一路上，除了一般地感觉氧气不够，呼吸稍难外，并无其他反应，白天在温度百度（华氏）以上的汽车里，未曾受暑，夜间在零下十度（摄氏）的帐篷里，未曾受凉。三个月没有发过烧，几次过海拔五千多公尺的高山，也不感觉头晕脑胀。在拉萨住了二十多天，就觉得大部分已适应了，只是食欲稍减。但是到海拔更高的江孜，因为饭菜是北方口味，反大吃大喝。
    在兰州时，医生告诉我们，初到高原，最好是情绪安静，行动缓慢，我却常常违背医生的指示，一次到海拔四八八○公尺的温泉，因为风景太美丽了，上边雪峰重叠，构成银屏几道，下边温水潺潺，川流不息，我们住在西山坡，面对银峰，实在动人。我一时高兴，到处乱跑，又为友人讲解山脉的形成。太兴奋了，说话太多了，一时感觉头晕，当即吃了两瓣生蒜，也就好了。至于年青力壮的同志们，则有的上山，到山上温泉洗澡，有的下河，到河底温泉去洗脚，大家兴高彩烈。他们在高原上走了几天，已经适应了。
    以上所说的是高原上最高部分，是牧畜区；至于西藏农业地区，海拔在四千公尺以下，更容易适应了。以拉萨和日喀则为例，拉萨海拔三千六百公尺，虽已高出泰山两倍多，因为纬度关系，气候和北京差不多，冬季不如北京冷，夏季没有北京热。更是适于居住的地方。日喀则虽然海拔三千八百多公尺，但气候却有点和我的家乡山东曹州一带相同。我到那里，见市郊的土路，住居的房屋，使我有家乡之感。
