After the Start of Autumn, Late Autumn Crops Can Still Be Planted

    A group of agricultural scientists and experienced farmers in Jiangxi believe that as long as sufficient base fertilizer is applied and field management is done well, crops planted about ten days after the Start of Autumn can still maintain their yield.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th. Due to the drought, many late rice seedlings in Jiangxi province's rural areas had not been transplanted before the Start of Autumn (August 7th), and many autumn dry-land crops had not been sown. Therefore, whether planting after the Start of Autumn can guarantee a harvest and what technical measures should be taken have become issues of widespread concern. At a symposium jointly convened by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Nanchang Branch of the China Agricultural Society on August 6th, a group of agricultural scientists and farmers with rich production experience answered these questions.
    At the symposium, based on scientific experiments and practical production experience, everyone unanimously agreed that the earlier the late rice is transplanted, the higher the yield. However, due to objective limitations, late rice that could not be transplanted before the Start of Autumn can still be rushed into planting within ten days after the Start of Autumn to strive for maintaining yield; even if it is transplanted around August 20th, it can still yield a certain harvest. Professor Zhou Changxin and Zhou Xibin of Jiangxi Agricultural College introduced the situation of their school's rice sowing period experiment last year, saying that the "Zhechang No. 9" late rice variety, which has a longer growing period, was sown on July 16th and transplanted on August 16th, yielding 200 catties of rice per mu; the "Nanchang Liuxu" late rice variety, which has a shorter growing period, was sown and transplanted at the same time, yielding 110 catties per mu. The two professors believe that late planting of late rice varieties with longer growing periods generally results in less yield reduction. Wan Tang'an, vice-chairman of the "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Nanchang County, said that when they expanded the planting of late rice in 1954, they planted a lot of rice seedlings ten days after the Start of Autumn. At that time, the members of the cooperative thought that there would be no harvest from planting rice after the Start of Autumn, so the field management was very poor. However, the harvest still yielded more than 160 catties per mu. Based on the fact that the late rice sowing in Jiangxi Province this year was earlier and sparser than in previous years, everyone believed that if it is planted within ten days after the Start of Autumn and field management is done well, it is still possible to strive for a higher or the same yield as last year.
    This year, the sowing of late rice throughout the province was earlier than in previous years, and the seedlings are generally older. Therefore, everyone at the meeting believed that only by densely planting more seedlings can the maturity be accelerated and the yield increased. Zhang Dunzhao, a technician at the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, said that in 1954, a farmer named Yu in Dianqian Township, Nanchang County, planted late rice on August 28th with very short row spacing and 16 seedlings per hole, and a quarter of them had matured by late October; however, Fu Chaoke, a farmer in Sanhe Township, Xinjian County, planted late rice on August 26th with long row spacing and only seven or eight seedlings per hole, and only one-tenth of them had matured by late October. In addition, everyone believed that applying sufficient base fertilizer, weeding early, and planting the elongated seedlings deeply are also important technical links to ensure the yield of late-planted late rice.
    At the meeting, professors from Jiangxi Agricultural College and technicians from the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute also introduced the experiences of farmers in Shangrao, Yushan, Jiujiang, Yujiang, Poyang and other counties in planting soybeans, sweet potatoes, late corn and yellow millet after the Start of Autumn in previous years and obtaining good harvests.

### 立秋后还可以栽种晚秋作物

    立秋后还可以栽种晚秋作物
    江西一批农学家和有经验的农民认为：只要下足底肥、做好田间管理工作，立秋后十天左右栽种的庄稼，还可以保产。
    新华社南昌9日电　由于天旱，江西省农村中立秋（八月七日）前夕还有许多晚稻没有插秧，许多秋季旱作物也没有种下。因此，立秋以后种下去能不能保证收成？应该采取哪些技术措施？就成为大家普遍关心的问题。八月六日江西省农业厅和中国农学会南昌分会联合召开的座谈会上，一批农学家和富有生产经验的农民回答了这些问题。
    座谈会上，大家根据科学试验和生产实践的经验，一致认为晚稻愈早插，产量愈高。但是，由于客观条件的限制，未能在立秋前栽插下去的晚稻，立秋后十天内还是可以抢插，争取保产；迟到八月二十日左右插的，也能够有一定的收成。江西农学院教授周长信、周熙彬介绍他们的学校去年作水稻播种期试验的情况时说，七月十六日播种、八月十六日移栽的生长期较长的“浙场九号”晚稻，每亩收谷二百斤；同时播种、移栽的生长期较短的“南昌柳絮”晚稻，每亩也收到一百一十斤。两位教授认为迟插生长期较长的晚稻品种，一般减产较少。南昌县“八一”农业社副社长万堂安说，他们社里在1954年扩种晚稻时，立秋后十天还栽了很多禾，当时社员们认为立秋后栽禾无收，因此田间管理工作做得很差，但是收割的结果，每亩仍有一百六十多斤。根据江西省今年晚稻播种较早、较稀的情况，大家认为如在立秋后十天插上，又做好田间管理工作，仍可能争取到比去年高些或者相同的产量。
    今年全省晚稻播种比往年早，秧苗一般长得较老。因此，会上大家认为只有密植多插秧，才能提早成熟，增加产量。江西省农业科学研究所技术人员张敦照说，1954年南昌县店前乡一个姓喻的农民在八月二十八日栽下晚稻，行距很短，每穴插秧十六根，到十月下旬成熟的已达四分之一；可是新建县三合乡农民傅朝科在八月二十六日栽下晚稻，行距很长，每穴只插秧七、八根，到十月下旬只有十分之一成熟。另外，大家认为下足底肥，及早耘禾，并且把拔了节的秧苗深插下去，也是保证迟插晚稻产量的重要技术环节。
    会上，江西农学院教授和江西省农业科学研究所的技术人员还分别介绍了上饶、玉山、九江、余江、鄱阳等县农民往年在立秋后栽种大豆、蕃薯、晚玉米和黄粟得到了较好收成的经验。
