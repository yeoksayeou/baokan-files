    Old Problems Are Hard to Solve

    In work, all problems that have been delayed for a long time without being resolved become old problems as time goes by. The older the problem, the smaller the hope of solving it seems to be. Because some people have become accustomed to it and are numb, and no one takes it seriously anymore.

    This can only lead to problems becoming older and more numerous. Now, we should really change this situation and make our work advance more rapidly.

    老问题难解决
    工作中，凡是长期拖延没有解决的问题，随着岁月的增长，都变成了老问题。问题越老，解决的希望似乎越小。因为有些人从习惯到麻痹，谁也不以为然了。
    这样，只能使问题越拖越老、越拖越多，现在，实在应当改变这种局面，使我们的工作更迅速地前进。    周小萍
