    In the Forests of the Carpathian Mountains
    Romania, Yi Puerkalu
    The little forest train, with its metallic clang, passed through the solemnly standing pine forest. The locomotive whistled from time to time, as if paying tribute to the rising morning glow, the rose-colored distance, and the dawn that turned the leaves into a golden expanse. Through the white, misty fog emitted by the locomotive and illuminated by the sunlight, one could see the red-tiled roofs of Dobruja, the Sacur River, and the Crianța peaks, easily mistaken for a small black cloud suspended high in the sky.
    "Do you see those huge pine trees up there? They've been there for over two hundred years. These trees have seen a lot..."
    These few words from the old lumberjack, Cozma Bucur, spoken in a low but somewhat emotional voice, reminded me of an image that, not long ago, was very typical of many corners of Romania: the entire mountain range, once famous for its forest wealth, was sparsely populated with pine trees. Former capitalist corporations (mostly foreign capital) used sharp saws to cut down 1.4 million hectares of forest. Continuous, lush forests were devastated and razed to the ground. Now, thanks to the Romanian government's extensive afforestation and forest protection plans, such scenes are gradually disappearing. The few remaining traces are a testimony to a tragic history.
    Indeed, some scenes in the forest life of Romania have also disappeared forever without a trace. This refers to the past labor, the past life of lumberjacks. Regarding people's lives, it can be said that the exploitation of people by the masters of this place was even more cruel than the exploitation of these ancient trees.
    Cozma told me, "In the past, lumberjacks were destined to live a miserable life and die early. We worked with axes and hooks, just like our ancestors. Large timber was hauled by livestock, and sometimes by manpower. People slept in earthen cellars. As for food, more than 80 percent of us suffered from scurvy because we didn't have enough to eat. Medical benefits and medicine subsidies were out of the question. Even wages were given to us like we were thieves, just a few food stamps that were only valid in the shops opened by the bosses, which only sold dry bread and alcohol."
    But that era is long gone...
    Today, as you walk through the various forest farms in Romania and visit the new working conditions and living environments, you will see everywhere the profound changes that have taken place here in the era of people's power. This is how it is, and how it should be. Forests are one of the greatest wealths of our people. Emerald green pine forests, beech forests, and oak forests cover a quarter of Romania's land. Caring for the forests and our forest industry has always been the focus of attention of our Party and government. Due to the large-scale afforestation carried out every year, and due to the strict adherence to reasonable scientific principles in the development of forests, not only have the forests been revived, but also the labor and life of lumberjacks have been truly renewed. 1948 was a year of great transformation in the development of our country's forest industry, the year of the nationalization of forests and the arrival of the first batch of highly productive machines, machinery, and equipment from the Soviet Union. At that time, the first guest of the new life appeared in our forests—the chainsaw. Old lumberjacks, people who had spent their lives bitterly in the mountains, stroked the soft saw blades of the chainsaws with their weathered, rough hands, chainsaws that freed them from the exhausting work of wielding axes. The speed of logging has been greatly accelerated. However, a huge contradiction arose between the two to four-fold increase in the speed of forest harvesting and the then-current state of timber transportation: ox carts and water troughs, the only two tools for transporting timber, were no longer able to cope with the work. Piles of sawn timber rotted due to being left in the forest for too long and being exposed to rain.
    We must find a way to rectify the work. And the work was indeed rectified. Industrial locomotives, cranes, and generator sets for cranes, hundreds of various types of tractors, winches, self-propelled cranes, trucks, etc., were transported to our country from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. In the past five years, various new equipment in our country's forest industry has increased by nine to twenty times. Hundreds of kilometers of narrow-gauge forest railways have been laid. At the same time, many kinds of machinery and equipment have also begun to be manufactured in our country.
    During the years of our country's first Five-Year Plan, the labor productivity of the forest industry has been greatly improved, far exceeding the highest indicators during the capitalist rule. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan (we have already entered the first year of the second Five-Year Plan), it is stipulated that output and labor productivity will be greatly increased, while costs will be reduced.
    The lives of lumberjacks have undergone profound changes. In some places in the ancient Carpathian forests, workers' villages have been built for forestry workers, and electric lights have been installed for them. The workers' villages have dining halls, bathrooms, clubs, libraries, clinics, radio stations, and cinemas. In the recent years alone, more than 2,500 bases have been built, accommodating 80,000 workers. In the past, lumberjacking, which was regarded as "hard labor," now enjoys special honor. In the past three or four years, more than 40,000 workers have learned to operate new machines and units. Among them, thousands of advanced individuals in socialist competition have emerged, brave fighters striving for the victory of new things and striving to adopt scientifically based labor methods. The resolutions of the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party from August 19 to 20, 1953, guaranteed fair and reasonable wages for forestry workers.
    The lives of rafters have also changed. These people, who inherited ancient customs and lived on the water day and night, have obtained new working and living conditions. Bases and dining halls have been built specifically for them along the Bistrița River. The cliffs in the Toanci Valley and other places have been blasted away with explosives, cliffs that so many rafters had crashed into in the past. Many other things have been done for them!
    ...The wood falls from above, from the mountains, all the way to the chainsaw yards set up in the valleys. Hundreds of sawmills surround the edge of the forest like a necklace, working intensely day and night. Here, one can see a clear contrast between the past and the present: the simple small factories, like blacksmith shops in the countryside, have been replaced by new and improved factories. We can be proud of the dozens of such factories that have now been built. The powerful Vaduri and Vătrel Dornei timber joint factories, which occupy an advanced position in our national economy, are truly large factories like cities. For example, at the Vătrel Dornei joint factory, the production process is fully mechanized. The wood is no longer handled by hand as it used to be, but gently slides along toothed conveyor belts into the boiling water pool, where snow, ice, and mud are washed away. Then, the steel teeth of another conveyor belt grab them and send them to the huge electric saw workshop, where electric saws saw them open in a few minutes, turning them into white boards, piled high.
    The application of timber in our national economy is diverse, and if you were to list a list of uses, you could write several pages. However, in addition to the general uses of timber, we have now begun to manufacture new products—products of the future—according to the instructions of the 11th Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party. We have successfully used boards pressed from wood chips to make furniture, doors, truck boxes, and carriage walls. This kind of board is surfaced with decorative paper and soaked in a chemical, and can be compared with fine wood inlay. Wood fiber is also an achievement that our forestry has recently achieved. This achievement makes it possible to achieve good results in the production of certain important machines and instruments. For example, in the production of electrical industry products such as leather cases, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, sewing machines, etc. Layered, pressed wood is now used to manufacture gears, bearings, small pinions, etc.
    The Romanian People's Republic is one of the largest timber exporting countries in the world. In our national economy, timber exports occupy an important position. Romania's forests—pine, palm, and beech—are well received in dozens of countries, such as those in the Middle East and Near East. The boxes used to transport citrus fruits in these countries are made of Romanian wood.
    ...Of course, there are still some difficulties. Our country's forestry has not yet risen to the height required by the ever-growing needs of the national economy. Production efficiency in many timber processing factories and sawmills is still low due to insufficient utilization of equipment, insufficient skilled workers, and insufficient concern from some technical leaders for the wider adoption of advanced labor methods. However, all these difficulties are temporary, difficulties in progress, and the forestry workers of Romania can completely overcome them. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    在喀尔巴阡山的森林中
    罗马尼亚　伊·普尔卡鲁
    小小的森林火车带着钢铁的铿锵声穿过了凝然伫立的松树林。机车不时地鸣叫着，好像是在向升起的朝霞、向玫瑰色的远方和把树叶映成一片金黄色的晨曦致敬。透过机车所喷出的、为阳光所照射的白蒙蒙的雾气，可以看到多布鲁查的红瓦屋顶、萨库尔河以及很容易被当作是悬在高空的一朵小黑云的克良格山峰。
    “你看见了高处的那些巨大的松树吗？它们在那里已经呆了两百多年。这些树木可说是历尽沧桑的了……”
    老伐木工人柯兹马·布库尔的这几句声音低沉的但多少有些激动的话，使我回想起不久以前对罗马尼亚许多角落说来还是很有典型性的一幅景像：过去曾以自己的森林财富著称的整个山脉，只疏疏落落地长着一些松树。以前的资本主义大公司（大部分是外国资本）用锐利的锯子锯掉了一百四十万公顷的林木。连绵不断的繁茂的树林受到摧残，被夷为平地。现在，由于罗马尼亚政府实行广泛的植林和护林计划，这类景象已经在逐渐消失了。现存的不多的残迹是悲惨的历史的见证。
    真的，在罗马尼亚的森林生活中也有一些不留踪迹地永远消失的景象。这里指的是过去的劳动，是过去伐木工人的生活。关于人们的生活，可以说，以前这地方的主人对人的剥削比对这些古老的树木的剥削还残酷。
    柯兹马对我说，“过去，伐木工人命定要过悲惨的生活和早死。我们正像我们的祖先一样，是用斧头和钩子工作的。大木料用牲口拉，有时也用人力来拉。人们睡在土窖里。至于吃的呢，我们中有百分之八十以上的人都因吃不饱而害坏血病。医疗津贴和医药补助是根本谈不到的。甚至发工资也像对待小偷儿似地，塞给我们一点饭票，这种饭票只有在老板开设的那些光卖干面包和酒精饮料的铺子里才通用。”
    但是，这个时代早已过去了……
    今天，当你走过罗马尼亚的各个林场，参观新的劳动条件和生活环境的时候，处处都会看到在人民政权年代这里所发生的深刻变化。情形是这样，而且应当是这样。森林是我国人民最大的财富之一。翠绿色的松林、山毛榉林和橡树林复盖着罗马尼亚四分之一的土地。关怀森林、关怀我们的森林工业，一直是我们的党和政府的注意中心。由于每年进行的大面积造林，由于对森林的开发严格遵守合理的科学的原则，不但使森林复活了，而且也使伐木工人的劳动和生活得到了真正的新生。1948年是我国森林工业发展中大转变的一年，是森林国有化和从苏联运来首批有高度生产效率的机器、机械和设备的一年。当时，在我们的森林出现了新生活的第一位贵宾——电锯。年老的伐木工人，在山林中很苦地度过自己一生的人们，用他们的饱经风霜的粗糙的手抚摩着电锯的柔软的锯条，就是这些电锯使他们摆脱了那令人疲惫不堪的挥动斧头的工作。伐木的速度大大加快了。但是，在森林采伐速度加快两倍到四倍的情况和当时的木材运输状况之间，出现了一个巨大的矛盾：牛车和水糟这两种运输木料的唯有的工具，已经不能胜任工作了。一堆堆锯倒的木料由于在森林里放得过久，受到雨淋，而腐烂了。
    必须设法整顿一下工作。而工作也确实得到了整顿。从苏联和各人民民主国家向我国运来了工业用机车、起重机以及起重机用的发电机组、成百的各种类型的拖拉机、绞车、自动行动吊车、载重汽车等等。近五年来，我国森林工业的各种新的设备分别增加到九—二十倍。已经铺设了数百公里的窄轨森林铁路。同时许多种机器设备也已在我国开始制造。
    在我国第一个五年计划的几年间，森林工业的劳动生产率已大大提高，远远超过了资本主义统治时期的最高指标。到第二个五年计划末（我们已经进入了第二个五年计划的第一年），规定还要大大提高产量和劳动生产率，同时要降低成本。
    伐木工人的生活发生了深刻的变化。在古老的喀尔巴阡山森林中的一些地方为林业工人建起了工人村，为他们安装了电灯。工人村设有饭厅、浴室、俱乐部、图书馆、诊疗所、广播站和电影院。仅在最近几年就建筑了能容八万名工人的二千五百多个基地。过去被看成“苦役”一样的伐木工作，现在享有着特殊的荣誉。近三、四年来，有四万多名工人学会了操纵新机器和机组。他们中间涌现出数千名社会主义竞赛的先进者，争取新事物胜利、争取采用有科学根据的劳动方法的勇敢的斗士们。1953年8月19日至20日罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全会扩大会议的决议，为林业工作人员保证了公平合理的工资。
    筏夫的生活也有了变化。这种继承了古老的习惯，不分昼夜地在水上生活的人，已经得到了新的劳动条件和生活条件。沿比斯特里查河专门为他们建筑了基地和饭厅。托安奇山谷和其他地方的峭岩，已用炸药炸去，过去曾有多少筏夫撞上它们啊。为他们还做了许多事情！
    ……木头从上面，从山上一直落到设置在山谷中的电锯场。森林边缘的四周像项圈一样围着几百个锯木工厂，这些工厂夜以继日地紧张工作着。这里看得出过去和现在之间的鲜明对比：像农村的铁匠铺似的简陋的小工厂已被新的完善的工厂所代替。我们可以因现在建成的数十个这种工厂而自豪。瓦都里和瓦特尔·多尔涅依的强大的木材联合工厂，在我国国民经济中占有先进的地位，这是真正的城市般的大工厂。例如，在瓦特尔·多尔涅依的联合工厂中，生产过程已完全机械化了。木头已经不像从前那样用手搬运，而是轻轻地顺着有锯齿的传送带滑到滚水池里来，在这儿洗掉雪、冰和泥。然后另一个传送带的钢齿把它们抓住，送往巨大的电锯车间，几分钟后电锯就把它们锯开，变成白色木板，高高地堆起来。
    我国国民经济中对木材的应用是多种多样的，要是列一个用途表，就可以写上好几页。但是，除去一般的木材用途以外，我们现在根据罗马尼亚工人党第十一次代表大会的指示，已开始制造新产品——未来的产品。我们已成功地用木屑压制成的板子做家具、门、卡车厢和车厢壁。这种木板表面镶上装饰用纸并用一种化学药品浸过，就可以同镶嵌细木媲美。木质纤维也是我国林业不久以前所达到的成就。这项成就使得在生产某几种最重要的机器和仪器时达到良好的效果。例如在生产电气工业制品的皮套、吸尘器、冰箱、缝纫机等。层状的经过压制的木材，现在用来制造齿轮、轴承、小牙轮等。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国是世界上最大的木材输出国之一。在我国国民经济中，木材的出口占有重要地位。罗马尼亚的森林——松、棕树和山毛榉，在几十个国家，例如在中近东各国，都得到好评。这些国家运输橘类植物所用的箱子，就是用罗马尼亚的木材制造的。
    ……当然，还遇到一些困难。我国的林业还没有提高到国民经济不断增长着的需要所要求的高度。还时常因设备利用不够充分、工人不够熟练以及某些技术领导人对于更广泛地采用先进劳动方法关心不够，使许多木材加工工厂和锯木工厂的生产效率不高。但是，所有这些困难都是暂时的、前进中的困难，罗马尼亚的林业工人是完全可以克服的。　（本报特约稿）
