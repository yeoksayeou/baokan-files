The Trend of Opera
    Xu Wujia
    I haven't seen Shangdang local opera for many years. After watching it, I have some feelings, which are not specifically for Shangdang opera.

    Shangdang opera has come to perform in Beijing. In my opinion, it is significantly different from before, at least in one aspect: it now has female actors. This is an inevitable path in the development history of female roles. These rising stars must study hard and rehearse a lot in order to master more repertoire, especially traditional repertoire. Furthermore, the male artists who used to play female roles should continue to perform and should also train female apprentices well, so as to complete and fulfill their own historical mission. Other opera genres do this, and Shangdang opera should do the same. This trend is a positive trend, a good trend, and we can follow it.

    Another significant difference between Shangdang opera and before is the makeup and costumes of the female roles. Improvements in this area are naturally necessary, and should continue to develop. However, in recent years, I have seen that various local operas almost only follow one path in the makeup of female roles: they all follow the style of Peking Opera and Yue Opera (of course, the makeup methods and costumes of these two opera genres have their advantages), creating a uniform style. All the ladies and young mistresses must be covered in jewelry; the maids must not only have a bun, but also wear a thick braid, and the costumes are short jackets and long trousers, performing ancient people without any ancient flavor. This style is currently blindly followed. But I don't think this trend is a positive trend, as it has wiped out the characteristics of many local operas. Therefore, I would like to advise Shangdang opera to have the spirit of "Let the storms rage, I sit steadily in my fishing boat" in this regard, and not to "fall with the wind."

    In terms of headwear, I think it's better to keep it simple and elegant. Although Yan Rui, a courtesan of the Song Dynasty, wrote the line "If I can get mountain flowers to fill my head, don't ask where I'm going," that was only to pursue freedom in front of the government, not to really fill her head with flowers; if the whole head is covered with red flowers, without seeing any black hair, what kind of monster would that be? In saying this, I have no intention of asking everyone to be uniform. On the contrary, I want "a hundred flowers to bloom." I hope that each opera genre will study the original makeup methods and costumes of female roles: see what is beautiful and what is not; see what is too simple and what is too trivial; and how to improve on the original basis. You can learn from others, but you don't have to copy and imitate completely. The uniformity in the makeup of female roles mentioned above is precisely the wrong trend that hinders "a hundred flowers blooming" and "a hundred schools of thought contending," and it is worth being vigilant about.

    The trend of opera is not just about headwear and makeup. I am not only interested in hair issues (like people discussing braids), but just "drawing inferences from one instance." In addition, in terms of repertoire, costumes, language, music, props, directing techniques, etc., each local opera genre should develop steadily on the basis of its original traditions, maintain its unique style, and learn from others' strengths to make up for its own weaknesses. Absorbing external influences is necessary, but there is no need to blindly follow the trend.

    Let the trend of opera be one of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own skills," and don't turn the richness and diversity of the past into the uniformity of today.

    戏风

    多年未看上党家乡戏，看后有所感触，并非专为上党戏而发。
    上党戏来北京演出，据我看，同以前有显著不同的，至少有一条，这就是有了女演员。在旦角的发展史上这是必然之路。这些后起之秀，必须好好学习，多多排练，以求掌握更多的剧目，特别是传统剧目。再就是过去演旦角的男艺人们，仍当多多演出，并当好好带女徒弟，这样才能完成并尽到他们自己的历史使命。这点其他剧种这么做，上党戏也应当这么做。这股风是正风、好风，可以顺风而下。
    上党戏另外一点跟从前显著不同的，就是旦角的化妆和服装。这方面的改进，自然也是应该的，而且还应该不断发展。可是，这几年来，我看各种地方戏，在旦角的化装上，几乎只遵循一条路，都是随京剧和越剧的路子（当然这两个剧种的旦角化妆方法和服装都有它们的长处），来了一个清一色，凡是夫人、小姐，必是遍头珠翠；丫环则必上髻而外，还硬装一条粗大的辫子，而服装又是短衣长裤，演古人而无古风。这一套，目前也是靡然风从。但这股风我却觉得不是正风，它把许多地方戏的特色刮掉了。因此，我想奉劝上党戏在这方面要有“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”的气魄，不必“顺风倒”。
    头上，我以为是放简洁、雅致一些好。宋妓严蕊虽然有“若得山花插满头，莫问奴归处”之词，那只是在官府前面追求自由之意，并非是真个头上插满鲜花；如果满头全是红花，而不见黑发，那又成个什么怪物？我这么说，也毫没有要求大家统一起来的思想。正相反，倒是要求“百花齐放”。希望各剧种对原来的旦角化妆法、服装行头进行研究：看什么美，什么并不美；看什么是过于简陋了，什么又是过于琐碎了；如何在原来基础上加以改进。可以向人家来学，但不一定要全盘抄袭和模仿。上述旦角化妆方面的清一色化，倒正是阻碍“百花齐放”与“百家争鸣”的歪风，值得警惕的。
    戏风，不只头上化装一端，我并非只对头发问题（如人们议论辫子一样）有兴趣，只不过“举一反三”而已。此外，如剧目、服装、语言、音乐、道具、导演手法等等，各地方剧种都应该在自己原有传统的基础上加以稳妥的发展，保持特有的风格，取人之长补己之短。吸收外来影响，是必要的，但不必盲目风从。
    戏风，来一个“八仙过海，各现身手”吧，不要使当年的丰富多采，变成为今日的清一色。
