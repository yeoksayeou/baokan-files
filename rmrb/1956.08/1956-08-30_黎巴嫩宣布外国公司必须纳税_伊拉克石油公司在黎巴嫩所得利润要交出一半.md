Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 29th: Lebanon's Minister of State for Petroleum Affairs, Saeb Salam, said at a press conference on the 28th that from now on, all foreign companies in Lebanon must pay taxes and abide by Lebanese law.

Salam said that the tax-exempt treatment and differential treatment enjoyed by foreign companies in Lebanon are "relics of the past."

According to Lebanese law, various foreign companies agree that paying a portion of their profits to the government is equivalent to paying taxes.

Salam said at the press conference that Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have accepted the "Arabian Pipeline Company's" proposal to share profits worth 16 million US dollars. He also said that negotiations with the "Iraqi Petroleum Company," whose pipeline also passes through Lebanon, were not going smoothly.

Salam said that Lebanon is determined to obtain 50% of the profits earned by the "Iraqi Petroleum Company" in Lebanon. He said, "For the sake of our self-respect, we cannot accept less than 50% of the profits." He pointed out that the "Iraqi Petroleum Company" claimed to have made a profit of 11 million Lebanese pounds last year.

Salam also said that if the "Iraqi Petroleum Company" ceases its operations here, the Lebanese government has the right to confiscate its property according to law.

    黎巴嫩宣布外国公司必须纳税
    伊拉克石油公司在黎巴嫩所得利润要交出一半
    据新华社29日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩负责石油事务的国务部长赛布·萨拉姆28日在记者招待会上说，从现在起，在黎巴嫩的一切外国公司必须纳税和遵守黎巴嫩的法律。
    萨拉姆说，在黎巴嫩的外国公司所受的免纳税金的待遇和差别待遇，“是过去的遗物”。
    根据黎巴嫩的法律，各个外国公司同意把它们的一部分利润付给政府就等于缴纳税款。
    萨拉姆在记者招待会上说，黎巴嫩、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦已经接受了“阿拉伯油管公司”所提出的分摊价值一千六百万美元的利润的建议。他同时说，同油管也通过黎巴嫩的“伊拉克石油公司”所进行的谈判并不顺利。
    萨拉姆说，黎巴嫩决心要在“伊拉克石油公司”在黎巴嫩得到的利润中分得50％。他说，“为了我们的自尊心，我们决不能接受少于50％的利润。”他指出，“伊拉克石油公司”去年还说得到了一千一百万黎巴嫩镑的利润。
    萨拉姆还说，如果“伊拉克石油公司”停止它在这里的经营，黎巴嫩政府根据法律有权没收它的财产。
