Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch: Bangkok—Thai Economic Party Member of Parliament Nai Chern Puribo stated on August 23rd at the annual meeting of the Thai branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference had adopted the principle of peaceful coexistence, but some countries were obstructing peaceful coexistence.

Nai Chern told the press that he had decided to submit a motion to the Thai Parliament supporting the People’s Republic of China’s accession to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, for the Thai delegation to propose at the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference.

Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch: Bangkok newspaper reports: Nai Phenthai Chotnuchit, leader of the Thai "Hyde Park Movement Party," said at a press conference held on August 24th that the "Hyde Park Movement Party" believes that the Inter-Parliamentary Union should accept China as a member of the Union.

Nai Phenthai said, "We recognize the Beijing government as the government of 600 million Chinese people. If our party comes to power, we will immediately recognize it because it is a reasonable and legitimate government sufficient to represent the vast number of Chinese people."

He also said, "We support China's restoration of its seat in the United Nations and support the United Nations' rapid recognition of this government representing 600 million Chinese people. We also advocate the formal establishment of trade relations with China."

Former Thai Prime Minister and Democrat Party leader Nai Khuang Aphaiwong said that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is not a monopolistic organization of a certain country or a certain government, and every country has the right to participate. Therefore, the Thai delegation should not oppose the People's Republic of China joining this organization. At the same time, China's representatives should not be refused to come to Thailand to attend the meeting under the pretext that Thailand has not yet established diplomatic relations with China.

    泰国政界领袖主张
    各国议会联盟应接纳中国
    据新华社30日讯　曼谷消息：泰国经济人党议员乃琛·蒲里博8月23日在各国议会联盟泰国分会常年大会上说，各国议会联盟会议曾经通过了和平共处的原则，但是却有一部分国家在阻挠和平共处。
    乃琛对报界说，他决定向泰国议会提出支持中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟的议案，以供泰国代表在各国议会联盟会议提出。
    据新华社30日讯　曼谷报纸消息：泰国“海德公园运动党”领袖乃彭泰·触的努七在8月24日举行的记者招待会上说，“海德公园运动党”认为，各国议会联盟应当接纳中国成为联盟的会员。
    乃彭泰说，“我们承认北京政府是六亿中国人民的政府，如果我们的党得以执政，我们将立即承认它，因为它是足以代表中国广大人民的合理和合法的政府”。
    他还说，“我们支持中国恢复在联合国里的席位，支持联合国从速承认这个代表六亿中国人民的政府。我们还主张同中国正式建立贸易关系”。
    泰国前总理、民主党领袖乃宽·亚派旺说，各国议会联盟并不是某一个国家或某一个政府的垄断组织，每个国家都有权利参加。因此，泰国代表不应当反对中华人民共和国加入这个组织。同时不应当借口泰国同中国还没有建立邦交而拒绝中国代表来泰国参加会议。
