    Striving to Catch Up with Advanced Domestic Levels
    Heilongjiang and Chongqing Improve the Quality of Local Industrial Products

    (Reported by this newspaper) To produce more and better daily necessities, state-owned factories in Heilongjiang Province are actively organizing teams to learn advanced experiences from various places. The Food Industry Bureau has decided that within the next two years, product quality should catch up with advanced domestic levels.

    In the first half of this year, state-owned factories in rubber, leather, shoes, soap, glass, oil and fat chemicals, matches, ceramics, enamel, pharmaceuticals, and fountain pens sent people to advanced factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places to learn. In early July, the Food Industry Bureau organized more than 140 people, including factory directors, technicians, and workers from food industry factories, to learn advanced experience in manufacturing soybean oil, various wines, canned goods, pickles, and soft drinks in major cities such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou.

    Currently, the quality of more than ten types of products from Heilongjiang's local industries has improved. After the leather workshop of the Harbin Leather and Shoemaking United Factory promoted the advanced experiences of Tianjin and Shanghai, it solved the long-standing problem of rough leather surfaces, improving the leather grade. After the Gongnong Match Factory promoted Qingdao's advanced operating methods, the number of defective matches decreased, and the problems of "eating heads," misfires, and failure to strike disappeared. The quality of enamel products from the Harbin Enamel Factory, except for some issues with acid and heat resistance, meets the standards in other aspects, and some aspects have already caught up with the level of advanced factories. According to feedback from commercial departments, the 32-size washbasin they produce is very popular among consumers. The Harbin Oil and Fat Chemical Factory solved the problems of water separation and thinning in snow cream, and the fragrance has also been enhanced.

    The quality of other products such as shoe polish, rubber shoes, matches, soap, injectable medicines, and fountain pens has also improved. It is expected that more affordable and high-quality daily necessities will appear on the market in the near future. (Huang Yunfei, Sun Junwen)

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th - Since the launch of the product quality improvement campaign in Chongqing's local industries in April, the quality of products in most factories has improved.

    According to a report at the third factory director conference held by the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau from August 1st to 3rd, the quality of 88 out of 93 local industrial products has risen. Among them, light bulbs, rubber shoes, small rubber balls, sulfuric acid, etc., have reached or exceeded the quality standards stipulated by the state and have caught up with the advanced national level. For example, the average service life of light bulbs has reached about 1,500 hours. Sulfuric acid has been well-received by various industrial departments in the city because it has reduced impurities. The quality of the rotary press ink produced by the Chongqing Paint Factory has improved significantly because it adopted the quality standards of the Tianjin Paint Factory and learned from Tianjin's technical data; Chongqing Daily, which used to purchase rotary press ink from other regions, has already placed bulk orders with this paint factory.

    In the first two months of this year, although the total industrial output value of Chongqing's local industries increased by 43% compared to the same period last year, the quality of most products showed a downward trend. In order to change the situation of declining product quality, the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau, under the supervision and assistance of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, launched a product quality improvement campaign in the city's local industries. In this campaign, based on deeply mobilizing the masses, various factories universally conducted quality planning, formulated or revised product quality standards, and improved enterprise management. Many factories also put the products of advanced coastal areas, foreign products, and the same varieties of products from their own factories together, so that all employees could evaluate them, in order to learn from others' experiences. Chongqing Leather Company, Chongqing Leather Factory, Chongqing Automobile Parts Factory, and others even invited university professors, Soviet experts, and representatives of mass organizations to discuss how to improve product quality.

    In the process of formulating quality standards, many factories have specifically studied the impact of equipment, technical operations, and raw materials on quality, and proposed practical and feasible measures to improve quality. For example, the Chongqing Paint Factory had long been unaware of the reason why the paint was not smooth and fine. This time, after specific analysis, it was discovered that it was because the semi-finished product in the oil refining workshop - the clarification time of crude oil was insufficient. Therefore, when formulating quality standards, this factory came up with a solution to improve the quality of the paint.

### 努力赶上国内先进水平  黑龙江和重庆的地方工业产品质量提高

    努力赶上国内先进水平
    黑龙江和重庆的地方工业产品质量提高
    本报讯　黑龙江省地方国营工厂，为了生产更多更好的日用品，积极组织力量到各地去学习先进经验。食品工业局决定在今明两年以内，要使产品质量赶上国内的先进水平。
    今年上半年，橡胶、皮革、皮鞋、肥皂、玻璃、油脂化学、火柴、陶瓷、搪瓷、制药、金笔等地方国营工厂，都派人到天津、上海等地的先进工厂去学习。七月初，食品工业局又组织了食品工业工厂的厂长、技术人员、工人等一百四十多人，到天津、上海、北京、武汉、广州等各大城市，学习制造豆油、各种酒、罐头、酱菜和清凉饮料等方面的先进经验。
    现在，黑龙江省的地方工业，已经有十多种产品的质量提高了。哈尔滨制革制鞋联合厂制革车间，推广了天津、上海的先进经验以后，解决了长期没有解决的面革粗糙问题，提高了皮革等级。工农火柴厂推广青岛的先进操作法以后，火柴的废支减少了，吃头、放炮和划不着的现象也没有了。哈尔滨搪瓷厂的搪瓷品质量，除了耐酸、耐热还有些问题以外，其他项目都合乎标准，有的项目已经赶上了先进厂的水平。据商业部门的反映，他们生产的32号面盆很受消费者欢迎。哈尔滨油脂化学厂解决了雪花膏出水和发稀的毛病，香味也加浓了。
    其他如鞋油、胶鞋、火柴、肥皂、针剂药品和金笔等，质量也都有所提高。预计在不久的将来，将会有更多的物美价廉的日用品出现在市场上。　（黄云飞、孙浚文）
    新华社重庆5日电　重庆市地方工业从四月份开展产品质量优良运动以来，大部分工厂的产品质量都提高了。
    据重庆市工业局在八月一日到三日召开的第三次厂长会议上的报告表明：九十三种地方工业产品中，有八十八种产品的质量上升。其中电灯泡、胶鞋、小皮球、硫酸等都已经达到或超过国家规定的质量标准，赶上了全国的先进水平。例如电灯泡平均使用寿命已经达到了一千五百小时左右。硫酸因为减少了杂质，受到全市各工业部门的欢迎。重庆油漆厂出产的轮转机墨因为采用了天津市油漆厂的质量标准和学习了天津厂的技术资料，质量已经显著提高；一向购买外区轮转机墨的重庆日报，已经向这个油漆厂成批定购。
    重庆市地方工业在今年头两个月中，虽然工业总产值比去年同期增长了43％，但是大部分产品质量都有下降的趋势。为了改变产品质量下降的情况，重庆市工业局在中共重庆市委员会的督促、帮助下，在全市地方工业中开展了产品质量优良运动。各厂在这一运动中，在深入发动群众的基础上，普遍进行了质量规划，制订或修订了产品质量标准和改进了企业管理工作。不少工厂还把沿海先进地区的产品、国外的产品和本厂相同品种的产品放在一起，让全体职工进行评比，以便从中学习别人的经验。重庆皮革公司、重庆皮革厂、重庆汽车配件厂等更邀请了大学教授、苏联专家和群众团体的代表一起座谈如何改进产品质量的问题。
    在制定质量标准的过程中，许多工厂都具体研究了设备、技术操作、原料等对质量的影响，提出了切实可行的改进质量的措施。如重庆油漆厂长期以来不知道油漆不光不细的原因在那里。这次经过具体分析才发现原来是因为炼油车间的半成品——原油的澄清时间不够。因此，这个工厂在制订质量标准的时候，就想出了办法，使油漆质量有所改进。
