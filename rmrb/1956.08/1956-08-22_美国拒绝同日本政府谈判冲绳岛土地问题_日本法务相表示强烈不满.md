Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 21st: Japanese Minister of Justice Ryozo Makino today expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, General Lanzil, for refusing the Japanese government's intervention in the Okinawa land issue.

Makino stated that he would explain Japan's position in detail to the U.S. State Department and demand that the United States not unnecessarily provoke anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people.

Prior to this, the Okinawa Five Groups Council, in order to resolve the issue of the U.S. military's increased requisition of land for military use as soon as possible, had requested that the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, General Lanzil, who also serves as the Chief Executive of the U.S. Ryukyu Military Government, hold a tripartite meeting with the Japanese government and representatives of the Okinawan residents. However, Lanzil wrote to Hidehira Higa, the Chief Executive of the local Ryukyu government, on August 17, publicly refusing to negotiate with the Japanese government and only intending to "consult" with Higa at an "appropriate time."

Lanzil's attitude has also aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Okinawan public. Social Democratic Party figures pointed out that if the U.S. military authorities do not make concessions to accept the four principles proposed by the residents, negotiations held in Okinawa will not be effective.

Okinawan residents, in order to defend their homes and oppose the U.S. plan to increase the requisition of 12,000 acres of land to expand military bases, have put forward four principles, including "Not a single 'tsubo' of land will be sold to the United States," and are continuing their struggle. Okinawan residents have also sent representatives to Japan to explain their plight under U.S. military rule, and they have received the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

Under these circumstances, the U.S. military authorities not only refused to negotiate with the Japanese government but were also afraid of the Japanese public sending a delegation to Okinawa for investigation. On August 20, the U.S. military authorities, on the grounds that they "could not handle it in good faith," refused to allow an 18-member delegation composed of many Japanese mass organizations to go to Okinawa.

    美国拒绝同日本政府谈判冲绳岛土地问题
    日本法务相表示强烈不满
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本法务相牧野良三今天对远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔拒绝日本政府干预冲绳岛土地问题一事表示强烈的不满。
    牧野表示，他要向美国国务院详细说明日本的立场，并且要求美国不要不必要地激起日本人民的反美情绪。
    在这以前，冲绳岛的五团体协议会为了早日解决美国增征军用土地问题，曾经要求兼任美国琉球军政府行政长官的远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔同日本政府和冲绳岛居民代表举行三方面的会谈。但是，兰尼兹尔在八月十七日写信给当地的琉球政府行政主席比嘉秀平，公开表示拒绝同日本政府会谈，只打算在“适当时机”同比嘉“协商”。
    兰尼兹尔的这种态度也引起了冲绳岛公众的强烈不满。社会大众党人士指出，如果美军当局不作让步来接受居民提出的四项原则，在冲绳举行的谈判是不会有什么效果的。
    冲绳岛居民为了保卫家园，反对美国增征一万二千英亩土地来扩建军事基地的计划，曾经提出了“一坪土地也不卖给美国”等四项原则，并且正在继续进行着斗争。冲绳岛居民还派代表到日本说明了他们在美军统治下的苦状，他们得到了日本广大群众的支持。
    在这种情况下，美军当局不仅拒绝同日本政府谈判，并且害怕日本公众派代表团到冲绳岛进行调查。八月二十日，美军当局以“不能作善意的处理”为词，拒绝准许日本许多群众团体组成的一个十八人的代表团到冲绳去。
