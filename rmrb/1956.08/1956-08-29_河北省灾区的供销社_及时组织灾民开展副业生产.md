    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Telegram: Supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas of Hebei Province are adopting the method of "planning while acting, producing while acting, and promoting sales while producing," to promptly organize disaster victims to develop sideline production and help them to help themselves through production.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various disaster areas are arranging a variety of sideline production activities for disaster victims based on local existing foundations and the principle of having raw materials and sales channels, and are formulating procurement plans. The Baoding Special Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has initially formulated a plan for this winter and next spring, including sixty-nine kinds of sideline occupations such as homespun cloth, cotton blankets, belts, vermicelli, aquatic products, crude saltpeter, and local medicine, from which disaster victims can earn more than 34.6 million yuan. In early August, disaster victims in seven counties, including Qingyuan and Xincheng, produced more than twenty kinds of sideline products such as vermicelli, pockets, and medicinal materials, with a total value of more than 40,000 yuan. In Huanghua, Jiahe, and other seven counties in the Cangxian Special District, more than 20,000 disaster victims, under the arrangement of local supply and marketing cooperatives, have engaged in more than ten kinds of sideline production such as braiding straw hat braids, twisting hemp ropes, and weaving reed bags, and sold sideline products worth more than 159,000 yuan to the supply and marketing cooperatives in early August. The Ninghe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has pre-purchased more than 4.2 million catties of green dry grass, 37,000 straw bags, and more than 13,000 reed mats from disaster victims, and has distributed 48,963 yuan in pre-purchase deposits.
