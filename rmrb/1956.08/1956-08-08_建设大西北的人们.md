    The People Building the Great Northwest
    By Our Special Correspondent Shao Hua

    Not long ago, I visited the Great Northwest. I cannot forget the richness and beauty of the Great Northwest, and I especially cannot forget the young people who are working selflessly to develop and build it.

    We cannot imagine developing and building the Great Northwest as something as beautiful as poetry, as light as cotton. Coming here means being prepared to face hardship and difficulty. And the youth of this construction era are unwilling to choose an easy path for themselves.

    There was a young man from Liaoning Province named Yu Dianzhi who was inspired by a news report in the newspaper titled "Building Our Motherland's Rich Interior." He wrote several letters to the Yumen Oil Mine, saying that he wanted to be a petroleum exploration team member in Yumen. But the Yumen Oil Mine wrote back several times, saying: You are still young, you should continue your studies. Later, he simply wrote back saying: "You don't need to reply, I am leaving immediately for Yumen to realize my ambition!" So, he scraped together enough money for the trip, passed through the starting point of the Great Wall, Shanhaiguan, crossed its endpoint, Jiayuguan, and arrived in Yumen. He finally became a petroleum vanguard – an exploration team member. He said: "I don't want to live an easy life, only a life of arduous struggle has meaning!"

    The Yumen Oil Mine has a nationally famous women's surveying team. Most of them came from the coastal areas of East China. One day in July last year, He Binbin, the leader of a line selection group in this team, was working in the desert. Because they finished too late, they didn't return to the tent, and it got dark. Then a strong wind rose. Although it was summer, the weather suddenly turned cold. One comrade suggested digging a pit in the ground and burying themselves in the sand to keep warm. But after a while, the sand cooled down, so they dug again and changed locations. They changed several times throughout the night before making it to dawn. Then they jumped up cheerfully and started working again. In May last year, Chen Zhuying's group from their team went to work in a place in the Helan Mountains. Once, they didn't get a drop of water for two days. They sent two team members to find water. Because these two team members hadn't had a drop of water for two days either, they fainted as they walked. But in the end, they used the strength of their will to find the water. They said, "When we think that the places we have surveyed will see the rise of forests of oil derricks, all the hardships become sweet and joyful!"

    This spring, tens of thousands of demobilized construction soldiers came to Yumen. Many of them were former combat heroes. Liang Guanglu, the artillery squad leader of a certain unit, killed thirty-four enemies in sixteen days in a battle in Korea, and was awarded a second-class merit. This time, when they were transferred to Yumen, it was originally decided that cars would take them from the regiment to the division. But because there was not enough gasoline, they had to walk. This further increased their determination to build Yumen. What excitement they felt as they welcomed their first day of work in Yumen! Many comrades couldn't sleep that night and got up before dawn. Because: "From today onwards, we will become oil workers!"

    I also visited Liujiaxia. Because of the need to determine the dam site of the hydroelectric station ahead of schedule, this place is in a tense period. In the Yellow River Gorge, on the steep and straight cliffs, you can see groups of two or three drilling, surveying, and geological workers everywhere. Tents, drilling towers, red flags, and markers are spread throughout every corner. Here, if you talk to anyone, their enthusiasm for construction will immediately and strongly infect you. There was a young man who graduated from Changchun Northeast Geological Institute last December. His name is Han Changyao, and he was born in the land of fish and rice in the South. When graduating, he could fill out three choices for his work area. But he filled them all with "Borderland, Borderland, Borderland"; Regarding the scope and nature of work (such as indoor, outdoor, teaching work, etc.), he could also fill out three choices. He filled them with "Outdoor, Outdoor, Outdoor." When his classmates learned that he was assigned to Liujiaxia, they all said with envy: "You are so lucky!" He said to the classmates who were assigned to Xinjiang: "You are even more fortunate, I can only work in the central part of the borderland!" When he set off from Changchun to the Northwest, passing through Zhengzhou, everyone had a few days off and could go home to see their families. But the grand ambition of developing and building the Great Northwest made him eagerly want to reach his work post immediately. When he arrived in Liujiaxia, it was a severe winter. Making a 1:2000 map requires high accuracy; every stone must be visible. In order to meet the quality standards, he often had to hang on cliffs with ropes, persevering despite the wind and snow. He would bring a few cold steamed buns up the mountain before dawn, and because he couldn't bring water, he would sit on the snow and eat them at noon, quenching his thirst with snow. When he talked about this, I asked him: "As a young student, how do you feel about encountering such a hard life as soon as you leave school?" He replied: "We don't feel it's hard, it's a blessing. No one can enjoy the beauty of the motherland's nature as much as we geological workers. When we look at the rushing Yellow River under our feet from the snowy mountains, and at the endless white mountain ranges in the distance, we will think: In a few years, there will be a huge power station here. At that time, we will take a speedboat, go for a stroll in the upstream reservoir, and watch thousands of electric lights reflected in the lake, that will be beautiful!"

    There is also a women's surveying team in Liujiaxia, the famous Chen Xiudi Team. In order to build the country's water conservancy projects, their footprints have covered the Yongding River, Sanmenxia, and now Liujiaxia. Working in the frozen winter, their hands became stiff, so they rubbed them to get a little warmth and continued working. They left with a few cold steamed buns in the morning and could only return to the tent at night. In the rainy summer, they didn't know how many times their clothes were soaked through with sweat and rain in a day. But regarding these hardships and difficulties, Chen Xiudi said: "We are human, and humans live to overcome difficulties. When we think: our drops of sweat will turn into bright electric lights, and these cliffs will turn into beautiful lakes, all difficulties become very small!"

    Not only does the encouragement of the distant future turn hard life into happiness; how well people find happiness in hard work! The days when I was in Liujiaxia were beautiful spring days. Every morning, groups of two or three people set off, facing the dawn, carrying heavy instruments. When the sun set, they came back with their sweat-soaked shirts. At this time, not to mention the grand scenes on the playing field, inside the tents, accordions were played, harmonicas were blown, and the songs of youth were sung. Some young people who liked peace and quiet went to the Yellow River to fish in twos and threes. A mischievous young man quietly walked behind him and pulled the accordion forcefully "嗡——", scaring away the fish that was about to be hooked. Then there was a chase and laughter similar to children playing hide-and-seek. They were so happy and full of youthful vitality in their work!

    About ten miles east of Lanzhou is the construction site of the Yellow River Bridge on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. This is China's first large-scale steel arch bridge, which was completed not long ago. When you stand under the bridge, you feel like it's a long rainbow painted in the sky. The river water is swirling, rushing and roaring. But when you stand on the bridge, you can't hear the sound of the rushing and roaring. The people working below seem so small. This makes it hard to imagine how people erected such a huge thing in the sky. I visited a crane operator here named Han Fuyuan. I asked him how many bridges he had built, and he counted on his fingers for a long time, only remembering a few of the larger ones: Wulonggou Bridge, Dahecha Bridge, Cangku, Jingjiadian Bridge, etc. At the beginning of the construction of this bridge, he had countless times taken a raft back and forth on the rushing and roaring Yellow River; In order to rescue the bridge pier that was washed away by the flood, he had to go into the waist-deep water in the freezing cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius every day and work for several hours. I asked him if he was cold, he said: "It's a bit cold, but if you wipe your hands with alcohol, you'll still sweat after working for a while. Speaking of hardship, building the bridge in Wulonggou was the hardest. At that time, there were no houses, and tents were set up on the snow with some wheat straw for bedding. At night, the ground would melt as soon as you lay down; as soon as you went to work during the day, it would freeze again. — It's much better now!"

    "It's much better now!" I heard many people say this sentence in the Northwest, no matter how hard it seems now. At the same time, people not only like to compare with the hardships of the past, but also like to compare themselves with the greater hardships of others. In this bridge construction site, some live in damp cave dwellings, some live in small houses where there is no room to turn around after placing a bed; A tarpaulin is used as a door, and a hole is dug in the wall as a window; When it rains, it doesn't rain outside, but it still drips inside. But the comrades here said: "The conditions here are simply blessed by nature. Because there is an inexhaustible supply of Yellow River water, it has aroused the envy of many people!"

    Not only do people love to say: "It's much better now," but also they love to say: "Come and see again later!" What confidence do people have in the bright and brilliant future of construction!

    In order to cultivate those tens of millions of acres of sleeping fertile fields, for the undiscovered treasures of the vast Gobi Desert and the Qilian Mountains, the Great Northwest attracts the hearts of tens of millions of people. Currently, immigrants and land reclamation teams from Henan, workers from Shanghai, cadres, engineers, technicians, and experts from Beijing, plus machines, steel, cement, rails, and steel pipes, are surging like a tide from the sky to the ground towards the Northwest. The trains on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the cars on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway, and the planes from Lanzhou to Urumqi, are all crowded going west; but relatively empty going east. Buying a train, car, or plane ticket to the west is simply difficult.

    Despite this, manpower is still lacking for the rich and vast Great Northwest. All departments need people. Just one example is enough to illustrate the problem: The trade company of the Yumen Oil Mine needs 1,500 to 1,700 people; but now they only have 200 people. Getting a haircut here takes fifteen minutes; because there are many people eating, the cooks have also switched to continuous day and night operations. The children of immigrants from Henan who have graduated from elementary or junior high school could not easily find jobs in Henan. As soon as they arrive here, railways, oil mines, hospitals, trade companies, banks, post offices... are all arranged for them...

    I would like to use these few sentences to describe my overall impression of traveling in the Northwest:

    The Great Northwest extends a welcoming hand to the eastern part of the motherland, and the Great Northwest shines with brilliant light. It seems to be saying: Young people, hold up your chests that can overcome difficulties, take bold strides, towards the Great Northwest, start – march!

### 建设大西北的人们

    建设大西北的人们
    本报特约记者　韶华
    不久之前，我访问了大西北，我忘不了大西北的富饶和美丽，我尤其忘不了为了开发和建设大西北而忘我劳动的那些青年们。
    我们不能够想像：开发和建设大西北，像诗歌一样美妙，像棉絮一样轻柔。到这里来，是应该准备迎接艰苦和困难的。而真正建设时代的青年，是不愿意为自己选择轻松的道路的。
    辽宁省有一个名叫于殿志的青年，他受到报纸上“建设我们祖国富饶的内地”一篇通讯的鼓舞，曾几次写信给玉门油矿，说他要到玉门作一个石油勘探队员；而玉门油矿几次写信给他都说：你还年青，你应当继续升学。后来，他干脆写信说：“你们不必回信了，我马上就出发到玉门实现我的志愿！”于是，他凑足了路费，进了伟大长城的起点山海关，越过它的终点嘉峪关来到了玉门。他终于成了石油尖兵——勘探队员了。他说：“我不愿意过轻松的生活，只有艰苦的斗争生活才有意义！”
    玉门油矿有一个全国闻名的女子测量队。她们大多是从华东沿海来的。去年七月有一天，这个队里的何彬彬领导一个选线组在沙漠里工作。因为完工太晚，没有回到帐棚，天就黑了。这时又起了大风。虽然是在夏天，可是天气骤然寒冷起来。一个同志提出在地下挖一个坑，把自己埋在沙窝里取暖。可是过了一刻，沙子凉了，她们就再挖再换。一夜换了好几次，才熬到黎明。于是她们又欢蹦乱跳地起来工作了。去年五月，她们队的陈珠英小组到合黎山一块地方工作。有一次两天没有得到一滴水。她们便派了两个队员去找水。因为这两个队员也是两天没喝一滴水，走走就晕倒了。但结果她们用自己坚强意志的力量，还是把水找来了。她们说：“当我们想到我们勘测过的地方将要升起一座座的石油塔的丛林，一切的艰苦都变成甜蜜和快乐了！”
    今年春天，有成千上万的复员建设军人来到了玉门。他们之中有不少是过去的战斗英雄。某部炮兵班长梁广禄，在朝鲜某次战斗中，十六天内曾打死了三十四个敌人，立了二等功。这次，他们转业到玉门时，本来决定由汽车把他们从团里送到师里的。但因为汽油不够，只好步行。这更增加了他们建设玉门的决心。他们到了玉门，是以如何兴奋的心情来迎接自己的第一个工作日呵！许多同志在那天夜里睡不着觉，天不亮就起床了。因为：“从今天起，我们就成为一个石油工人了呀！”
    记者也曾经访问了刘家峡。因为要提前确定水电站的坝址，这里正处在紧张的时期。在黄河的峡谷中，在立陡笔直的山崖上，你到处可以看见三三五五的钻探、测量、地质工作者。帐棚、钻塔、红旗、标杆布满在各个角落。在这里你随便找个什么人谈谈，他们对建设的热情会马上强烈地感染着你。有一个去年十二月才从长春东北地质学院毕业的青年。他的名字叫韩长耀，他生在南方的鱼米之乡。在毕业时关于自己的工作地区，可以填三个志愿。可是他填的却都是“边疆、边疆、边疆”；关于工作的范围和性质（如室内、野外、教学工作等），也可填三个志愿。他填的是“野外、野外、野外”。当同学们知道他被分配到刘家峡的时候，都以羡慕的口气说：“你真幸福！”他向分配到新疆的同学说：“你们更幸福，我只能在边疆的中部工作了！”当他从长春出发来西北经过郑州的时候，每个人都有几天假期，可以回家看一看。但是开发和建设大西北的宏愿使他渴不可耐的要马上到达自己的工作岗位。他到了刘家峡，正是严寒的冬天。作二千分之一的填图，精确度要求很高；每一块石头都必须看得到。为了达到工作质量标准，常常要用绳索吊在悬崖上工作，任凭风雪怎样吹打，也要坚持下去。早晨天不亮带几个冷馒头上山，因为不能带水，中午就坐在雪地上啃着吃，渴了就吃雪。他谈到这里，记者曾问他：“对于一个青年学生，一出学校门就碰到这样的艰苦生活，你感觉怎样呢？”他回答说：“我们并不觉得苦，这是幸福的。谁也没有我们地质工作者能够这样尽情欣赏祖国大自然的美景。我们在雪山头上看着眼下奔腾的黄河，看着远处白色的绵绵山岭都会想到：过不了几年，这里就会出现一个巨大的发电站。那时候，我们坐上汽艇，在上游水库游逛几遭，看着千万盏电灯映在湖水里，那才美呢！”
    在刘家峡也有一个女子测量组，那就是著名的陈秀娣组。为了建设祖国的水利事业，她们的足迹印遍了永定河、三门峡，现在也印遍了刘家峡。在冰封雪冻的冬天工作，她们的手冻僵了，就搓磨一下取点温暖继续工作。早晨带几个冷馒头出发，晚上才能回到帐棚里。在多雨的夏天，汗水和雨水也不知道一天湿透过多少次衣服。但是对于这些艰苦困难，陈秀娣说：“我们是人，人就是为了克服困难而生活的，当我们想到：我们的滴滴汗水，将要变成盏盏雪亮的电灯的时候，这悬崖陡壁将要变成美丽的湖泊的时候，一切困难都变得非常渺小了！”
    不仅是远景的鼓舞使艰苦的生活变成幸福；人们又多么会在艰苦的工作中寻找快乐啊！记者在刘家峡的那几天，正是美丽的春日。每天早晨，三三五五的人，迎着黎明的曙光，扛着沉重的仪器出发了，太阳落山时，他们提着汗水浸透了的上衣，又回来了。这时，球场上的胜景不必说，在帐棚里边，手风琴奏起来，口琴吹起来，青春的歌声唱起来了。有些爱好安静的青年们，就三三两两地到黄河边去垂钓。调皮的小伙子悄悄地走到他身后，猛力拉一下手风琴“嗡——”，刚要上钩的鱼儿被吓跑了。于是出现了一场类似孩子们捉迷藏的追逐、嘻笑。他们在劳动中，是那样的愉快，充满了青春的活力！
    从兰州东去十来里地，就是包兰铁路黄河大桥工地。这座中国第一座大型钢拱桥，在不久之前已经竣工了。你站在桥下面，简直觉得它是画在天空的一道长虹。河水在旋转，在奔腾咆哮。而当你站在桥上面的时候，那种奔腾咆哮的声音已经听不见了。在下面工作的人，看来是那样的小。这使你很难想像，人们是怎样把这样的庞然大物支架在天空的。记者曾经访问了这里一个名叫韩复元的起重工。我问他修过多少桥梁，他扳着手指头算了半天，只举了几个比较大的记得起来的：鸟龙沟桥、大河岔桥、沧口、井家店桥等。在修建这座桥的开初，他曾经无数次的架着木筏在奔腾咆哮的黄河上来往；为了抢救被洪水冲垮的桥墩，他曾经在零下二十多度的严寒中，每天下到没腰的深水里，工作好几个小时。记者问他冷不冷，他说：“冷是冷一些，不过用酒把手擦一擦，下去工作一会还会出汗的。要说苦，在乌龙沟修桥时才算苦呢。那时没有房子，在雪上搭起帐篷铺点麦秸就是宿舍。晚上躺下来一暖地面就化了；白天一上班，就又结冻。——现在好多了！”
    “现在好多了！”记者在西北曾听许多人说过这句话，不管现在看来还是怎样的艰苦。同时，人们不仅爱和过去的艰苦作比较，人们也喜欢用别人的更艰苦来同自己作比较。在这个桥梁工地，有的住的是潮湿的窑洞，有的住的是摆一张床就没有转身地方的小房子；雨布一挡就是门，墙上挖个孔就是窗户；下起雨来外面不下了，里面还滴哒不停。但这里的同志们说：“我们这里的条件简直是得天独厚。由于有取之不尽用之不竭的黄河之水，引起了很多人的羡慕！”
    不仅人们爱说：“现在好多了”，而且人们也爱说：“等以后你再来看看！”人们对建设的光辉灿烂的远景，怀着怎样的信心啊！
    为了开垦那千万亩熟睡的良田，为了大戈壁和祁连山还没有被发现的宝藏，大西北吸引着千万人的心。目前，从河南来的移民，垦荒队，从上海来的工人，从北京来的干部、工程技术人员、专家，加上机器、钢材、水泥、铁轨、钢管，像潮水一样从天空到地面向西北涌流。兰新铁路的火车，兰新公路的汽车，从兰州到乌鲁木齐的飞机，往西——全是拥挤的；往东——却是比较空松的。你要买一张西去的火车、汽车或飞机票，简直是困难的事。
    尽管这样，对于富饶和广阔的大西北，人力仍然是缺乏的。一切的部门都需要人。这里只举一个例子就够说明问题了：玉门油矿的贸易公司需要一千五至一千七百人；而现在他们才有二百人。在这里理一个发是十五分钟；因为吃饭的人多，炊事员也改为日夜流水作业。从河南来的移民的高小或初中毕业的子女，在河南时不容易找到工作，一到这里，铁路、油矿、医院、贸易公司、银行、邮电局……全都安排下来了……
    我想用这样几句话，来说明我在西北旅行的总印象：
    大西北向祖国的东部伸出欢迎之手，大西北闪着灿烂的光。她好像说：青年们，挺起战胜困难的胸膛，迈起豪壮的步伐，向大西北，开步——走！
