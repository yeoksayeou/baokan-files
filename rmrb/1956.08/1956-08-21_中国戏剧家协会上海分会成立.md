Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th: The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association was established on the 19th. At the inaugural meeting, Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Zhang Junxiang and 96 others were elected as directors and alternate directors.

    At the inaugural meeting, Zhou Xinfang said to more than 400 drama workers: Shanghai is the birthplace of spoken drama and film, and also a city with a large opera troupe. The potential strength of Shanghai's drama circle is very strong, but these forces have not been fully mobilized, and drama work cannot meet the needs of the people. In order to mobilize the strength of dramatists, encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of drama workers, and better organize the drama team, the establishment of this branch is of great significance.

    Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, who came to Shanghai from Beijing to attend the meeting, elaborated in detail to the attendees the importance of prosperous creation, learning from the national tradition of opera, and correctly understanding the educational role of modern dramas and historical dramas. He hoped that the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association would strengthen unity with fraternal units, troupes, artists, and drama workers, and carry out criticism according to the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," continuously improve drama art, and serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Many drama workers criticized at the meeting the past conservative and rude attitude towards the national opera heritage, and suggested that the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association discuss this issue. They also requested the branch to study and solve the living difficulties that exist in many troupes in Shanghai and other problems that hinder the development of the drama industry.

    中国戏剧家协会上海分会成立
    新华社上海20日电　中国戏剧家协会上海分会已在十九日成立。在成立大会上选出了周信芳、袁雪芬、张骏祥等九十九名理事和候补理事。
    周信芳在成立大会上向四百多个戏剧工作者说：上海是话剧和电影的发祥地，又是拥有庞大戏曲队伍的城市，上海戏剧界的潜在力量十分雄厚，但是这些力量尚未充分调动起来，戏剧工作还不能满足人民群众的需要。为了调动戏剧家力量，鼓舞戏剧工作者的积极性和创造性，更好地把戏剧队伍组织起来，成立这个分会是有很大意义的。
    由北京来上海参加大会的中国戏剧家协会主席田汉，向到会者详细地阐述了繁荣创作、向戏曲的民族传统学习和正确认识现代剧与历史剧的教育作用的重要性。他希望中国戏剧家协会上海分会加强与各兄弟单位、剧团、艺人、戏剧工作者之间的团结，并根据“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，展开批评，不断提高戏剧艺术，为祖国社会主义建设服务。
    许多戏剧工作者在会上批判了过去对民族戏曲遗产采取保守和粗暴的态度，并建议中国戏剧家协会上海分会能对这一问题进行讨论。他们还要求分会对目前上海许多剧团中所存在的生活困难以及其他阻碍戏剧事业发展的各种问题加以研究解决。
