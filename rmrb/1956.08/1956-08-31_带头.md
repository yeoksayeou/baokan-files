    Leading by example, originally a good method to promote work, carry out movements, and drive social progress, often encounters problems despite being a universally recognized principle.

    Not long ago, Anyang mobilized farmers to dig wells. Digging wells was one of the best measures to solve rural water conservancy problems, but due to the lack of bricks and stones, farmers had to find ways and means. The Party Branch Secretary of a certain township mobilized farmers to "dig" ancestral graves, and "led by example" by first "digging" his own ancestral grave. Under his "leadership," the farmers followed suit and dug up ancestral graves. Some opened the graves and said to the bones: "Grandpa, please help us build socialism too!"

    The township Party Branch Secretary "led by example" and dug up his ancestral grave in order to mobilize everyone to dig wells. His sincerity for socialism is very touching, but the impact was very bad, which was really beyond his expectations.

    It can be seen that one cannot "lead" randomly. If one "leads" randomly, it will lead to bad results.

    Even for the best things, leading by example must first drive thought; if one uses one's own "leadership" to "force" the masses to do as oneself does, it is actually a disguised form of coercion and commandism, and good things can be turned into bad things.

    带头

    先进带后进，本是推进工作、开展运动、带动社会前进的好方法。但就在这大家公认的规律上，却也常常发生问题。
    不久以前，安阳动员农民打井，打井本是解决农村水利问题的一个最好的措施，但由于缺乏砖石，农民须挖窍门、想办法。某乡的支部书记就动员农民“挖”祖坟，并“带头”首先“挖”了自己的祖坟。农民在他这样“带头”之下，纷纷挖起祖坟来。有的挖开坟墓对着尸骨说：“老爷爷，请你也帮助我们建设社会主义吧！”
    乡支部书记为了动员大家打井，“带头”挖了自己的祖坟，其真心为社会主义，是很感动人的，可惜影响却很不好，实在出乎他的意料之外。
    可见“头”也不能乱“带”，乱“带”，就会带出恶结果。
    即使是最好的事情，带头也要首先带动思想；如果以自己的“带头”，“逼着”群众照自己的样子作，实际上那是变相的强迫命令，好事也会作成坏事的。
