Xinhua News Agency, August 15th. The Second National Congress of the Chinese Education Workers' Union closed in Beijing on the 15th.

    The Congress determined that the current tasks of the Education Workers' Union are to give play to the role of the union organization as a communist school, to unite and educate all education workers and science workers; to mobilize and organize them to march towards culture and science, to improve the quality of education and work standards; to go deep into the masses and protect their interests in all aspects, to strive to help them improve their working conditions, solve various difficulties in life and learning, and oppose all bureaucratic styles of work that disregard the suffering of the masses; to continuously expand the ranks of advanced producers; and to strive to improve the cultural level of the people and cultivate new forces for socialist construction.

    The discussions at the Congress reflected that current education workers, especially primary and secondary school teachers and amateur teachers, are facing the phenomenon of excessive burdens. In some areas, especially in rural areas, there is still political discrimination against teachers, and the social status of teachers is not being given the respect it deserves. There are also situations in which their work is arbitrarily controlled in various aspects; many of their personal difficulties, such as housing, the burden of multiple children, and advanced studies, have not received due attention from relevant departments, and some problems that should and could be solved have not been resolved. Teachers in institutions of higher learning have too many part-time jobs and social activities, and it is generally reflected that six-fifths of their time is not well guaranteed.

    The Congress believes that the Education Workers' Union must effectively protect the interests of education workers and science workers in the future. In order to enable education workers and science workers to better carry out teaching and scientific research work, the Education Workers' Union must actively play a supervisory role, urging and helping the administration to create the necessary working conditions for them, ensuring that they have ample time for lesson preparation and scientific research, and ensuring the supply of necessary books, reference materials, equipment, and instruments.

    Regarding the issue of improving living conditions, the Congress believes that the Education Workers' Union must overcome bureaucracy, be good at relying on the enthusiasm of the masses, care about all aspects of the masses' lives, and promptly reflect the suffering of the masses; better use the union's membership hardship subsidies and do a good job in the mutual assistance savings fund. The Congress requires educational administrative departments to change the past practice of only asking about work and not caring about the suffering of the masses, and, under the conditions of need and possibility, to genuinely care about and solve the living difficulties of the masses and change the unreasonable situation of welfare expenditure.

    The Congress believes that the Education Workers' Union must also strengthen the political work of the masses and help the masses further improve their ideological level through self-education methods.

    The Congress believes that the Education Workers' Union should establish and improve its organizational structure, actively develop membership, and resolutely correct the phenomenon of closed-doorism.

    At the closing meeting, the delegates unanimously approved Wu Yuzhang and other eighty-eight people as members of the Second National Committee of the Chinese Education Workers' Union.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th. Vice Chairman Zhu De received all the delegates attending the Second National Congress of the Chinese Education Workers' Union on the afternoon of the 15th and took a photo with the delegates.

    Also present at the reception were Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Zizai, Vice Minister of Higher Education, and Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education.

    新华社15日讯　中国教育工会第二次全国代表大会十五日在北京闭幕。
    大会确定教育工会当前的任务是，发挥工会组织的共产主义学校的作用，团结、教育全体教育工作者、科学工作者；动员和组织他们向文化进军，向科学进军，提高教育质量和工作水平；深入群众，从各个方面保护他们的利益，努力帮助他们改善工作条件，解决生活上、学习上的各种困难，反对一切漠视群众疾苦的官僚主义作风；不断扩大先进生产者的队伍；为提高人民的文化水平，培养社会主义建设的新生力量而奋斗。

    大会认为，教育工会今后要切实保护教育工作者和科学工作者的利益。为了使教育工作者、科学工作者更好地搞好教学业务和科学研究工作，教育工会要积极地起到监督作用，督促和帮助行政为他们创设必要的工作条件，保证他们有较充裕的备课和科学研究时间，保证供应必要的图书参考资料、设备和仪器。
    关于改善生活条件的问题，大会认为，教育工会必须克服官僚主义，善于依靠群众的积极性，关心群众生活上各方面的问题，及时反映群众的疾苦；更好地使用工会的会员困难补助费和搞好互助储金会的工作。大会要求教育行政部门改变过去只问业务，不关心群众疾苦的作风，在需要和可能的条件下，切实关心和解决群众的生活困难，改变福利费开支不合理的情况。
    大会认为，教育工会还必须加强群众的政治工作，帮助群众以自我教育的方法进一步提高思想水平。
    大会认为，教育工会应该建立和健全组织机构，积极发展会员，切实纠正关门主义的现象。
    在闭幕会上，到会代表一致通过了吴玉章等八十八人为中国教育工会第二届全国委员会委员。
