Luoyang Lights
Bai Hua

The night train sped along the south bank of the Yellow River, the soft-sleeper carriage was very quiet…

In our small compartment, there were four berths, two upper and two lower. I lay on the upper berth, and across from me was a young woman with a child, who was already sound asleep. The blonde little boy occasionally raised his head, grinning at the white-haired lieutenant general in the berth below mine. He hadn't lain down yet. I could see his silver hair and hear him amusing the child with great interest. Across from the general sat a major who had just boarded at Xin'an. This traveling companion hadn't taken off his hat when he entered the carriage. He saluted the general, and then silently lifted the corner of the curtain, gazing out the window. Outside was the darkness, the lights of the countryside flying past the window like scattered stars...

I had just finished reading Kazakevich's "Spring on the Oder," and for a long time, I felt as if Lieutenant General Xishukrelov was standing in front of me, deep in thought...

"It's one o'clock!" The voice of the general below me, talking to himself, attracted my attention: "Almost to Luoyang!"

"Yes," I replied to the general from above, "Almost there..."

"Where are you going?"

"I'm going to Beijing!"

"And you?" the general asked the major.

"I'm going to Zhengzhou to transfer to Hankou, then take the Yuehan Railway to Hunan, and then transfer again to Guizhou to take a bus back to Yunnan." He answered the general very carefully and fluently, as if reporting to his superior.

"That's a long way to go!" The general said meaningfully.

"It's not close!"

"You..." the general said, "You work in an infantry regiment, right?"

"Yes. I'm the deputy regimental commander in the border troops." The major hesitated and asked the general, "Sir, you?..."

"I work in a military region!" The general uttered these words lightly. People who had worked in the army for a long time could understand that he was the commander of the military region.

"Ah!" The major's gaze fell on the general's gold shoulder boards. After a long silence, they started talking again.

"That unit in Yunnan, is it from the Taiyue Military Region?" the general asked him.

"Yes, it came from Taiyue..."

"I met your troops before."

"Yes, our corps cooperated with almost every fraternal unit."

"Did you participate in the attack on Luoyang in the spring of 1948?"

"I did! Ah! Were you in the Chen-Su army before?"

"Yes! This time I'm out here, you could say it's a return to the old battlefield!" The general lifted the curtain and looked at the scattered lights. He said heavily and excitedly: "Luoyang! Luoyang! I will never forget this city..."

"You can't forget the places where you fought." The major agreed with his view.

"No, no," the general shook his head, "Some places you just can't remember... you remember the place where more blood was shed the clearest. Although I didn't shed blood in Luoyang, a comrade shed a lot of blood for me..."

The general pulled out a black leather bag from under his pillow, and from the bag he took out a worn-out notebook made from the reversed binding of an ancient thread-bound book. He slowly flipped through the notebook and said to the major:

"This time I came out, I specifically brought my old diary with me. Reading it on the road can remind me of many things. You can look at this page, which has the Battle of Luoyang. I won't write as movingly as a novel. Novels are written by writers, but many writers disdain writing about good comrades and true events like I do in my diary."

The major took the general's diary. Because the light was too high, he had to stand up to read it. This way, not only could he see it clearly, but I could see it clearly too. I figured it was okay since it was the general's old diary, and there was nothing secret about it, and since the general motioned for me to look, I just took a look as well. The general's diary was written in ink—how interesting! He could still carry an ink box during the war. The handwriting was powerful but hasty, unlike his current composure. He wrote:

March 12, 1948, Sunny, in the ancient capital of Luoyang

I dislike the slow speed of advancing troops the most, as it can affect the victory or defeat of the entire battle and the entire battlefield situation. Before dawn, I scolded the regimental commander of the ×× regiment. The vanguard troops had entered the city at ten o'clock last night, but the follow-up troops could not continuously move in. Most of the ×× regiment was still crowded in Dongguan before dawn. That kind of slowness shows the commander's lack of decisiveness and timidity. Although the enemy's flanking fire could still shoot at the bridge, they could not control this bridge in any way. One of our brigades has already passed over this bridge. There are still bodies of many comrades from the spearhead troops on the bridge. I placed our position behind a broken wall next to the bridgehead. The operations staff officer made suggestions to me, and I sent him away! He doesn't understand the meaning of me standing in front. The telephone operator didn't want to pull the telephone forward, which made me very angry. I said: "You are not cherishing your deputy brigade commander! You are cherishing the enemy!" The telephone operator dared not disobey. But the guard made suggestions again. I did not argue with him. I ordered him: "Go! Order you to run to find the commander of the mountain artillery battalion, and tell them to advance quickly!" The guard left, and I was much freer. At this time, there was a fraternal unit wearing gray military uniforms—the Taiyue troops—passing over the bridge one by one, their postures very low and light!

Just as two fraternal units were moving side by side onto the bridge, the enemy fired artillery continuously. Heavy mortar shells exploded around me. I waved my arms and shouted for the troops to take cover.

"Eat—eat—!" Experienced soldiers can tell that the landing point of this curved artillery shell is nearby. I also realized the danger. Just as I hadn't had time to consider how to deal with it, a comrade in a gray military uniform jumped over and pushed me to the ground, pressing on top of me. The shell exploded, and a column of smoke mixed with fire and clods of earth rose in front of me. Like a heavy hailstorm, flying shrapnel and clods of earth fell again, making the ground tremble. I felt blood on my neck, but I also felt that I was not injured. When I sat up, I saw that the comrade in the gray military uniform next to me was bleeding from his forehead. Obviously, it was a very dangerous wound. I was about to call for a stretcher when I saw two comrades in gray military uniforms running over to carry him away.

Our army's artillery finally destroyed the enemy's flanking bunkers, and the troops poured into the city like flowing water. This torrent could be seen in two colors in the morning glow, one was straw yellow and the other was blue-gray. It was this torrent that toppled the old Luoyang and made Luoyang the people's Luoyang.

Street fighting is still continuing. Now, the remaining three gates of Luoyang have been breached, and all the troops entering the city are besieging the enemy's last position: Luoyang Middle School in the northwest corner of the city.

The pace of the battle has slowed down slightly, but my mood has become even more tense, because I am worried about the nameless comrade who shed blood for me. He may die from excessive blood loss; even if he can be cured, a very deep scar will be left on his forehead... I wish the brave comrade longevity! I hope he can live to continue fighting...

The train whistled and gradually slowed down. The major closed the general's diary. He looked at the general, who was lifting the curtain to look out. At this time, I saw the major pull the brim of his hat down again, almost covering his eyebrows...

"Dear passengers!" The clear voice of the female announcer on the platform, "You have arrived at Luoyang Station. Luoyang is a famous ancient capital. Since its liberation in the spring of 1948, it has become more beautiful day by day..."

The general stood up from his seat, excitedly nodding his head at the window, his silver hair trembling. He put his right hand on the major's shoulder. The major looked hesitantly at this white-haired, battle-tested general. I—only I saw that the major's shrewd and excited eyes were wet, and his pupils reflected the brilliant, star-like lights of Luoyang...

    洛阳灯火
    白桦
    夜行火车在黄河南岸驰行着，软席寝车厢内非常安静……
    我们这个小房间里有四张铺，两张上铺两张下铺。我躺在上铺，在我对面躺着的是一个带着孩子的年青女人，这时她已经沉睡了。黄头发的小男孩不时抬起头裂着嘴对着我铺下面那个白了头发的中将微笑，他还没躺下，我能看见他那银丝似的头发，能听见他很有兴致地和孩子逗着乐的声音。将军的对面坐着刚从新安上来的一个少校。这个旅伴一进车厢就没脱帽，他对着那位将军敬了个礼，以后就默默地掀开窗帘的角，注视着窗外，窗外是黑夜，农村的灯火像疏落的星星似地从窗前飞过……
    我刚刚把卡扎凯维奇写的“奥德河上的春天”看完，很久，我还觉得西淑克雷洛夫中将就站在我的眼前沉思着……
    “一点了！”我下面的那位将军自己对自己说话的声音吸引了我：“快到洛阳了！”
    “是的，”我在上面回答将军：“就要到了……”
    “你到哪里去呀？”
    “我去北京！”
    “你呢？”将军又问那位少校。
    “我到郑州转车到汉口，再坐粤汉线的车到湖南，然后再转车到贵州搭汽车回云南。”他很仔细，并很流利地回答了将军，就像是在向自己的首长做报告。
    “路还远得很喽！”将军意味深长地说。
    “是不近哩！”
  “你……”将军说：“你是在步兵团里工作吧！”
    “是。在边防部队里担任副团长。”少校迟疑地问将军：“首长，你？……”
    “在一个军里工作！”将军轻轻地吐出这几个字，在军队里长期工作过的人就可以明白他就是军长。
    “啊！”少校的目光落在将军的金肩章上。沉默了很久，他们俩又开始了谈话。
    “云南那个部队就是太岳区的队伍吧？”将军问他。
    “是，是从太岳出来的……”
    “我和你们的队伍见过面。”
    “是的，我们兵团差不多配合过每一个兄弟部队。”
    “1948年春天，攻打洛阳你参加了吗？”
    “参加了，啊！以前您是在陈、粟大军？”
    “是呀！我这一次出来可以说是旧地重游喽！”将军掀开窗帘，看着那些疏落的灯光。他沉重而激动地说：“洛阳！洛阳！这个城市我是不会忘记的……”
    “作过战的地方都忘不了。”少校同志同意他的看法。
    “不，不，”将军摇摇头，“有些地方就记不住，……哪里流的血多，哪里就能记得最清，我在洛阳虽然没有流血，可有一个同志替我流了很多血……”
    将军从枕下抽出一个黑皮包，从皮包里取出一个破旧的用线装古书翻过来订成的本子，他慢慢地翻着这个本子对少校说：
    “我这回出来，特意带着以前的日记本子，在路上翻翻，能想起很多事，你可以看看这一页，写有洛阳战役的事，我不会写得像小说那样动人，小说是作家写的，可有很多作家不屑像我记日记那样，把一些好同志和真事写出来。”
    少校接过将军的日记本，由于灯太高，他不得不站起来看，这么一来，不但他能看清，就是我也能看清，我觉得好在是将军以前的日记，没什么秘密，并且将军示意让我看，我也就顺便看了一遍。将军的日记是用墨笔写的——真有意思！战争时期他还能带墨盒。字迹很威武而潦草，不像他现在那么沉静。他写着：
    1948年3月12日，晴天，于古都洛阳
    我最不喜欢前进速度中的迟缓的部队，它能影响整个战斗的胜负，整个战场的形势。天不亮我就把××团的团长骂了一顿，先头部队在昨夜十点就攻进了城，后续部队不能源源不断运动进去，××团大部分人在天亮以前还在东关拥挤着，那种迟缓就说明了指挥员的不坚决和畏缩。虽然敌人的侧射火力还能往桥上射击，但无论如何他们是不能控制这座大桥了，这座桥上已经通过了我们一个多旅，尖刀部队有很多同志的尸体还在桥上。我把我们的位置放在桥头旁边的一块断墙背后，作战参谋向我提意见，我把他支派走了！他不懂我站在前面的意义。电话员不愿意把电话机往前拉可气火了我，我说：“你们不是在爱惜你们的副旅长！是在爱惜敌人！”电话员不敢不听话了。可警卫员又提意见了，我没有跟他争辩，我命令他：“去！命令你跑步找到山炮营营长，叫他们迅速前进！”警卫员去了，我可自由多了。这时我身边有一支穿灰军装的友邻部队——太岳的队伍，他们一个跟一个从桥上通过，姿势很低，很轻巧！
    正在两支兄弟部队并肩往桥上运动的时候，敌人连续开炮了，重迫击炮弹在我周围爆炸，我挥着胳臂喊着，要部队隐蔽。
    “吃——吃——！”有经验的军人都能听得出来这颗曲射炮弹的着地点就在附近，我也意识到这个危险，正当我还没有来得及考虑如何处置的时候，一个穿灰军装的同志跳过来，一把把我推在地上，他压在我的身上。炮弹爆炸了，在我面前升起了混着火和土块的烟柱，像下大冰雹一样，飞起的弹片和土块又落下来，打得土地发抖。我觉得我的脖子里有血，但我又觉得我确实没受伤，等我坐起来的时候，我才看见身边那个穿灰军装的同志额头上往外冒着血，很显然，是一个很危险的伤口。我正要叫担架，看见两个穿灰军服的同志跑过来把他抬走了。
    我军的炮火最后把敌人侧面碉堡都摧毁了，部队像流水一样从桥上拥进城去，这一股巨流在早晨的霞光中可以看见两种颜色，一种是草黄色，一种是蓝灰色，就是这样一股巨流冲倒了旧的洛阳，使洛阳成为人民的洛阳。
    巷战还在继续着。现在，洛阳其余的三座城门都被攻破了，全体入城部队都在围攻敌人最后的一个阵地：城西北角的洛河中学。
    战斗的节奏稍微缓慢了一些，但我的心情反而紧张了，因为我耽心那一位为我流着血的无名战友，他也许会流血过多而牺牲；即使能治好，他的额头上也将留下很深很深的疤……我祝福英勇的战友长寿！希望他能活着继续战斗……
    列车嘶叫了一声，渐渐缓慢下来。少校合上将军的日记本，他看了看将军，将军正撩起窗帘往外看。这时候，我看见少校又用手把自己的帽沿往下拉了一拉，拉得几乎压住了眉毛……
    “亲爱的旅客们！”站台上的女广播员清脆的声音，“你们到达的是洛阳站，洛阳是有名的古都，从1948年春天解放以来，她变得一天比一天更美丽了……”
    将军从座位上站起来，对着窗外激动地点着头，银白的头发抖动着。他把右手搭在少校的肩膀上，少校踌躇地看了看这位白发苍苍、身经百战的将军。我——只有我看见少校那精明激动的眼睛潮湿了，他的瞳孔里反映着灿烂的繁星般的洛阳灯火……
