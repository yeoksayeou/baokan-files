Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 6th: Former Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh, who had been imprisoned for three years, was released from prison on August 4th.

Western news agencies reported that Mossadegh, after his release, told a relative that Egypt's reclaiming of the Suez Canal was "completely legitimate."

Shortly after becoming Prime Minister of Iran in 1951, Mossadegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British oil enterprise in Iran. Later, a coup took place in Iran in 1953, and Mossadegh was subsequently arrested. An Iranian military tribunal sentenced him to three years imprisonment for treason.

General Riahi, who served as Chief of Staff during Mossadegh's time in office, was also released on August 3rd. He was also sentenced to three years imprisonment.
