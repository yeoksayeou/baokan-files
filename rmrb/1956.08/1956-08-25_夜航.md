    Night Navigation
    Liang Hanbing

    At night, the Wu River, a tributary of the Pearl River, appears exceptionally calm. The water flows gently along the foot of Wu Mountain, the murmuring sound of the water like a soft whisper. The moon breaks through the clouds! The waterfall cascading straight down from the valley glitters with silver light in the moonlight.

    The wooden boat of the Sanyuanli Fruit Production Cooperative circles past the sharp bend, carrying four people. Cooperative member A Da is at the bow, Xiao Li at the stern, these two young men skillfully rowing, the wooden boat swiftly cutting through the water. In the middle of the boat are four large bamboo baskets filled with newly harvested lychees and pineapples.

    Standing by the bamboo baskets is the cooperative chairman, Guo Huiquing. His beard is already gray, a long pipe in his mouth, quietly watching ahead. Lying on his back is an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl, his granddaughter Gui Li, who is intently gazing at the moon.

    "Grandpa, is it time to change shifts?" Gui Li asks Guo Huiquing.
    "Not yet? We'll switch after Chicken Beak Shoal. You rest well for a bit!"
    "How much further to the supply and marketing cooperative? It's making me anxious!"
    "What's the rush? When I was young, every time the fruit came in, I had to run back and forth to the market twice a night! Year after year, you get used to it."
    "Then tell me a story," Gui Li sits up, waiting for her grandfather to tell her a story.
    "Oh! You don't forget to ask me to tell you stories even when we're out! Okay, how many do you want? I have plenty! What should I tell you?" From the foot of the mountain across the river, a rumbling sound comes, followed by the whistle of a train. The echoes in the valley are deafening, and soon the train is visible....

    Guo Huiquing looks at the train speeding by like a fire dragon, knocks the ash from his pipe on the side of the boat and says, "Xiao Li, I'll tell you a story about dismantling the railway!" He then says to A Da, "Remember to call us to change shifts at Chicken Beak Shoal; I easily forget things when I'm telling a story."

    "Don't worry!" A Da and Xiao Li answer in unison. From their cheerful tones, you can tell that they are also eager to hear the story.

    "That was the second year after the Japanese surrender. Our entire village's orchards were growing vigorously. Just entering May, the lychees were already red. In the sun, they looked like clusters of small red lanterns. Ha! Everyone was overjoyed, thinking that once the fruit was picked, they could buy rice, pay debts, and make clothes. But unexpectedly, the Kuomintang's village thugs, the Bao chief, and the tax bureau also had their eyes on these fruits. As soon as the fruit was pruned, this tax and that donation came knocking on the door. The tax bureau also colluded with the merchants in the market to keep the prices very low. A hundred catties of lychees couldn't even buy a斗 of rice. Even though the fruit was abundant, everyone's difficulties increased instead. There was no way to live. One day, we heard that a train carrying military supplies was passing on the railway, shipped from the United States. We were furious when we heard that. I took the lead, gathered the young men, and colluded with the railway maintenance workers. We borrowed tools, and as soon as it got dark, we came out in wooden boats. Fifty or sixty of us got on the railway, and without saying a word, we started working. In less than an hour and a half, we dismantled more than a 里 of track..."

    A gust of wind blows across the water, and a water bird skims across the surface. Suddenly the wooden boat rocks violently twice.

    "What's wrong with the boat?" Guo Huiquing asks in surprise.
    It turned out that A Da and Xiao Li were so engrossed in listening to the story that they forgot to row. When Guo Huiquing shouted, they swallowed hard and started rowing again.

    "Well, what happened after it was dismantled?" Gui Li asks eagerly.
    "What happened?" Guo Huiquing laughs heartily, "It released our anger! That night, a train loaded with cannons and bullets arrived, more than thirty cars in total, and it plunged straight into the Wu River, standing up like a pagoda."
    "Why didn't you take us?" A Da asks dissatisfied.
    "Oh! Take you? You were only seven or eight years old then."

    A Da and Xiao Li both laugh after hearing that. They row the oars even more joyfully, the wooden boat flying like an arrow. The river channel gradually narrows, the mountains on both sides converging, and the boat soon reaches Chicken Beak Shoal. Guo Huiquing replaces A Da, and Gui Li takes over Xiao Li's oar.

    Suddenly a flash of lightning, followed by a muffled thunderclap, the Wu River is no longer calm, the waves are rolling. The wooden boat loses its balance, rising and falling with the rolling waves, the rain pouring down rapidly.

    Guo Huiquing orders A Da and Xiao Li to take out the tarpaulin to cover the fruit, while he continues to row steadily. This kind of sudden storm in the South is common, and Gui Li also straightens her chest as usual, rowing with all her might. The boat's speed is still very fast.

    Suddenly, with a loud "boom", a large rock rolls down from the top of the mountain across the river, landing right in the center of the railway track.

    "Landslide! The mountain stone has collapsed!" Guo Huiquing shouts repeatedly, steering the boat towards the shore, Gui Li also follows her grandfather, changing direction and rowing. Through the rain, the dark, ominous shadow of the giant rock can already be seen.

    "Quick! Quick! A Da, Xiao Li, we must quickly get ashore and move the stone away!"

    The boat is ashore, Guo Huiquing uses a thick hemp rope to tie the boat to a small tree, the waves lapping against the hull, the boat like a bound beast, desperately trying to break free.

    "Chairman Guo! What if the boat capsizes?" Xiao Li asks Guo Huiquing worriedly.

    "If it capsizes, it capsizes, the train is more valuable than our few baskets of fruit."

    With that, he is the first to run onto the railway track, A Da, Xiao Li, and Gui Li also follow.

    The fallen stone is a cubic meter in size, and the four of them use all their strength to pull it off the tracks. The rain continues to fall, and their clothes are already soaked.

    夜航
    梁寒冰
    夜，珠江的支流武水显得格外平静，水缓缓地顺着武山山脚流着，潺潺的水声好像有人轻声低语。月亮拨开乌云钻出来了！从山谷里直泻而下的瀑布，让月光照得发出了银色的闪光。
    三元里水果生产合作社的木船从急湾处打着回旋划过来了，船上坐了四个人，社员阿大在船头，小李在船尾，这两个小伙子，熟练地摇着桨，木船轻快地向前钻去。船的中间放着四只大的竹筐，里面装满了新下来的荔枝和菠萝。
    靠竹筐站立的是社长郭辉青，他胡须已花白，嘴里衔着长烟管，悄悄地望着前方。仰面躺着一个十八九岁的姑娘，这是他的孙女桂莉，她正凝神地望着月亮。
    “爷爷该换班了吧？”桂莉向郭辉青说。
    “早呢？过了鸡嘴滩才该咱接班，你好好歇一会儿吧！”
    “还有多远到供销社？真让人心焦！”
    “有啥急的？我年青的时候，果子一下来，哪天夜里也得往市场来回跑两趟！年年如此，日子长了也就习惯了。”
    “那您给我讲个故事听吧。”桂莉欠起身，等着爷爷给讲故事。
    “哦！出门你也不忘让我给你讲故事啊！好，要听多少，有多少！你说我讲什么好呢？”从河对面的山脚下，传来了一阵轰隆隆的声音，接着便听到了火车汽笛声。山谷里的回音震耳，很快地就看见火车了……。
    郭辉青看了看像火龙一样飞跑的火车，把烟袋往船帮上磕了磕说：“小莉，我就给你讲一段拆铁道的故事吧！”一面又对阿大说：“你们想着到鸡嘴滩叫我们爷儿俩换班；我讲起故事来可容易忘事啦。”
    “放心吧！”阿大、小李齐声回答着，从他们那愉快的声调里，可以听出，他们俩也急于想听故事。
    “那是在日本投降以后的第二年，咱们整个村子的果林都长的很旺盛；刚进五月，荔枝就红了，太阳一照，就像一嘟噜、一嘟噜的小红灯似的。喝！家家满心欢喜，心想等果子摘下来，该买米、还债、做衣服了。可是没料想，国民党的村丁、保长、税务局也都看中了这些果子。果子刚刚剪枝，这个税、那个捐，便要上门来了。税务局又勾结了市场的商人，把价码压的很低，一百斤荔枝，也换不上一斗米，果子丰收了，家家反而增加了困难，日子没办法过了。有一天，我们听说铁道上要过一趟军火列车，是从美国运来的，我们听了都要把心给气炸了。我领着头，把年轻小伙子们都联络起来，又和铁路的养路工区串通好，借了工具，等天刚黑便划着木船出来了。我们五六十个人上了铁道，二话没说就干起来了，不到一个半小时，就拆散了一里多长的路轨……”
    水面上吹来一阵风，水鸟擦着水皮飞过去了。忽然木船猛然摇动了两下。
    “船怎么了？”郭辉青奇怪地喊道。
    原来阿大和小李光顾了听故事，忘了摇桨。郭辉青这一喊，他们才咽了一口唾沫，重又摇起桨来。
    “嗯！扒了又怎样？”桂莉追问着。
    “怎样？”郭辉青爽朗地大笑起来，“出气了呗，夜里果然来了一列装满大炮子弹的火车，一共三十多节，一下就跌入了武水，像宝塔似地竖了起来。”
    “为什么不带我们去？”阿大不满意地问。
    “哦！带你们？那时你们才七八岁呀。”
    阿大、小李听后都笑了，他们把桨摇的更欢了，木船像箭似地飞跑着。河道渐渐地窄了，两边的山集拢过来，船很快地就到了鸡嘴滩，郭辉青替换了阿大，桂莉接过了小李的桨。
    忽然一道闪光，沉闷的雷声接着响了起来，武水不平静了，浪花翻滚着。木船失去了重心，随着翻滚的浪花起伏，雨急骤地泼了下来。
    郭辉青命令阿大和小李，把篷布拿出来盖好果子，自己仍然很平稳地摇着桨。南方这种突然袭来的暴风雨，是常有的，桂莉也照旧挺直了胸脯，用力摇着桨。船行的速度仍然很快。
    突然，“轰隆”一声巨响，从河对面的山顶上滚下来一块大石头，正好落在了铁道的中心。
    “坍方了！山石坍方了！”郭辉青连声喊着，把船向岸边摇去，桂莉也跟着爷爷转换了方向摇着桨。透过雨丝，已经可以望见巨石黑魅魅的影子了。
    “快！快！阿大、小李，咱们要赶快靠岸把石头搬出去！”
    船靠岸了，郭辉青用粗麻绳把船系在小树上，浪花拍打着船梆，船像是一头被缚住的野兽，狠命地向外挣脱。
    “郭社长！船要是翻了呢？”小李担心地问郭辉青。
    “翻了就翻了，火车比咱们这几筐果子值钱。”
    说罢，他第一个跑上了铁道，阿大、小李、桂莉也跟了上去。
    落下来的石头足有一立方公尺，他们四个人用尽力量把它拉到了轨道外面。雨继续下着，他们的衣裳早已湿透了。
