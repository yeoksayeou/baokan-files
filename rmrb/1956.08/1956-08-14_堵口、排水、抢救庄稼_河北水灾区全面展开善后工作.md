Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 13th: With water levels receding in the upper reaches of various rivers in Hebei Province, comprehensive post-disaster work to restore production has fully commenced.

In response to the receding water levels in the upper reaches of various rivers, the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department has organized five working groups to go to Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other regions to assist in blocking breaches. The Baoding Regional Flood Control Headquarters has also dispatched more than ten cadres, led by the commissioner, to provide specific guidance on breach blocking at the locations along the Zhulong River. By August 10th, five of the thirty-four major breaches on the main streams of the four river systems of the Grand Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, and Yongding River had been closed.

Simultaneous with blocking the breaches, various localities are actively draining water to rescue crops. Currently, Tongxian and Baoding regions have drained accumulated water from 3.82 million mu of farmland. In the cotton-growing areas of Feixiang and Cheng'an in Handan region, accumulated water has been drained from more than one million mu of cotton fields. Linzhang County has also supported and rescued more than 20,000 mu of seedlings.

Many villages that were flooded are starting to rebuild their homes with the help of the People's Government. Farmers in the flooded villages of Linzhang and Wei counties in Handan region are repairing their houses. More than 100 carpenters organized by Shulu County in non-disaster areas have rushed to the flood-stricken areas to help farmers repair their houses. More than 20,000 disaster victims in the villages in Gaoyang and Lixian counties of Baoding region, which were more severely flooded and where the floodwaters have not receded, have been transferred to safe areas and have also established temporary homes.

The people in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei have received great support from all sides. In addition to the large amount of relief funds allocated by the State Council for emergency relief, the Agricultural Bank of China has also allocated 10 million yuan in agricultural loans to Hebei Province to support farmers in restoring production. Grain, transportation departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives in Handan, Baoding, and other places have also promptly transferred grain, coal, and buckwheat and vegetable seeds to help disaster victims overcome difficulties in their lives and production. Relevant departments in Baoding region have established organizations for work-for-relief, livestock management, and native produce procurement, and have begun to organize disaster victims for production. Ninghe County in Tianjin region is actively rushing reeds, tung oil, blood meal and other fishing gear materials to the flood-stricken areas to support disaster victims in developing fisheries production.

    堵口、排水、抢救庄稼
    河北水灾区全面展开善后工作
    新华社保定13日电　河北省各河上游水势回落，各项恢复生产的善后工作已经全面展开。
    针对各河上游水势回落的情况，河北省水利厅组织了五个工作组分赴邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定等专区，协助堵口工作。保定专区防汛指挥部也派出干部十多人，由专员带领，到潴龙河两岸决口地点具体指导堵口事宜。到八月十日，南运河、子牙河、大清河、永定河四个河系主要干流上的三十四处重要决口，已有五处堵闭。
    与堵口同时，各地积极排水抢救庄稼。现在通县、保定专区已经排除农田积水三百八十二万亩。邯郸专区肥乡、成安等棉区，已经排除棉田积水一百多万亩。临漳县并且扶救了两万多亩禾苗。
    许多遭受洪水冲淹的村庄，在人民政府的帮助下开始重整家园。邯郸专区临漳、魏县等被淹村庄的农民正在修补房子。束鹿县在非灾区组织的一百多名木工，已赶赴水灾区帮助农民抢修房子。保定专区高阳、蠡县等县被淹较重、洪水未撤的村庄的二万多名灾民，转移到安全地区后也建立了临时家庭。
    河北水灾地区人民得到了各方面的很大支持。除国务院拨来大批救济款急赈外，中国农业银行又拨给河北省一千万元的农业贷款，支持农民恢复生产。邯郸、保定等地的粮食、交通部门和供销合作社，也及时调运粮食、煤炭和荞麦、蔬菜种籽，帮助灾民克服生活生产困难。保定专区有关部门已成立以工代赈、牲口管理、土产收购等组织，着手组织灾民生产。天津专区宁河县正积极向水灾区赶运苇箔、桐油、血料等捕鱼用具用料，支持灾民开展渔业生产。
