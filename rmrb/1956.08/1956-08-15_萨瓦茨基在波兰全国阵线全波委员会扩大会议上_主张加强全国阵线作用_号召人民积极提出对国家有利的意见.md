Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 14th. The Chairman of the Polish Council of State, Zawadzki, stated that currently, the Polish National Unity Front is an ideological, political, and organizational form of universal unity of the people based on the victorious people's democratic system, carrying out the struggle for peace and socialist construction.

When the local organizations of the National Unity Front are implementing the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, they should not be merely formalistic as they often were in the past. Instead, they should ensure that the vast majority of urban and rural residents regard the program put forward by the Party to the people as their own, fully discuss and analyze it, and find the best ways to implement this program in specific situations and under different circumstances from this free, creative, and patriotic discussion.

Zawadzki made these remarks at the enlarged plenary session of the All-Poland Committee of the National Unity Front, which opened on August 13th. He is a member of the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the Polish National Unity Front. He delivered a report on "The Work and Tasks of the National Unity Front" at the meeting.

When talking about the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, he said that the action program stipulated by these resolutions is to utilize all possible resources and potentials to improve the material situation of the Polish people as soon as possible, especially those employees with the lowest wages, and to thoroughly correct the deviations and errors in past planning and administrative work, so as to further democratize all aspects of the country's social, political, and economic life.

Zawadzki called on the Polish people to put forward new ideas that are beneficial to the country and of great value in further improving the people's living standards to enrich the program put forward by the Central Committee to the people of the whole country.

This plenary session will be held for two days, summarizing the work of the All-Poland Committee of the National Unity Front and stipulating new goals and working methods for local organizations. In view of the death of the Chairman of the All-Poland Committee, Bierut, the plenary session will also elect a new Chairman of the All-Poland Committee.

    萨瓦茨基在波兰全国阵线全波委员会扩大会议上
    主张加强全国阵线作用
    号召人民积极提出对国家有利的意见
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基说，目前，波兰全国阵线是以胜利的人民民主制度为基础的、普遍团结人民来进行争取和平和社会主义建设的思想、政治和组织形式。
    全国阵线各地组织在执行统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议的决议的时候，不应该像过去时常表现的那样只是徒具形式，而要使城乡绝大部分居民把党向人民提出来的纲领当作他们自己的纲领，充分地进行讨论和分析，并且从这种自由的、创造性的、爱国主义的讨论中找出在一定的场合和不同的情况下实现这个纲领的最好的方法。
    萨瓦茨基是在八月十三日开幕的全国阵线全波委员会扩大全体会议上说这些话的。他是波兰全国阵线全波委员会主席团委员。他在这次会议上做了关于“全国阵线的工作和任务”的报告。
    在谈到统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议的决议的时候，他说，这些决议所规定的行动纲领是为了利用各种可能的资源和潜力来尽快地改善波兰人民、首先是工资最低的那些职工的物质情况，并且彻底地纠正过去计划和行政工作方面的偏向和错误，使国家的社会、政治和经济生活的各方面进一步民主化。
    萨瓦茨基号召波兰人民提出对国家有利的、在进一步提高人民的生活水平有很大价值的新意见来丰富党中央全会向全国人民提出的纲领。
    这次全体会议将举行两天，将总结全国阵线全波委员会的工作和规定地方组织的新的目标和工作方法。鉴于全波委员会主席贝鲁特已经逝世，全体会议还将选举全波委员会主席。
