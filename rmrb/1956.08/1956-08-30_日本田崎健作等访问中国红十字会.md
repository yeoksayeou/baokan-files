Xinhua News Agency, August 29th. The entire personnel of the sixth Japanese "Martyr's Ashes Escort Group for Chinese War Dead," headed by Takezo Tasaki, and Takezo Takagi, the ship representative of the Japanese Red Cross's "Kouan Maru," visited the Chinese Red Cross in Beijing this afternoon. Li Dequan received them.

During the meeting, Li Dequan expressed her welcome to them and thanked the Japanese people for the sincere friendship they showed in the work of returning the ashes of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan. She said that through these friendly exchanges and the continued efforts of the people of China and Japan, the friendship between the two peoples would develop more broadly.

Takezo Tasaki, the head of the ashes escort group, said that they were representing the peace-loving people of Japan in escorting the remains of Chinese martyrs to China. He said: "These martyrs were deprived of their precious lives by Japanese imperialists. Whenever we peace-loving Japanese people think of these things, we are eager to join hands with your people to prevent the tragedy of war from recurring. In order to realize our desire for peace, we are working hard in our country to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs and to achieve disarmament. I think this is the best way to comfort the martyrs." Finally, Takezo Tasaki, on behalf of the ashes escort group, asked Li Dequan to send a pair of exquisite light blue palace lanterns, which they had brought specially from Japan, to the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Memorial Hall to be hung in front of the martyrs' spirits.

Takezo Takagi expressed his gratitude for the lenient treatment of Japanese war criminals by the Chinese government and the assistance of the Chinese Red Cross in helping these people return to Japan.

Those present at the meeting included Hu Lansheng, Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross, and Lin Shixiao and Peng Yan, Deputy Secretaries-General.

    日本田崎健作等访问中国红十字会
    新华社29日讯　以田崎健作为首的日本第六批“中国殉难烈士骨灰护送团”全体人员和日本红十字会“兴安丸”随船代表高木武三郎，今天下午在北京访问中国红十字会，李德全接见了他们。
    接见时，李德全对他们表示欢迎，并且感谢日本人民在送回中国在日本殉难烈士骨灰工作中表现出的真挚友谊。她说，通过这些友好往来和中日两国人民的继续努力，中日两国人民的友谊将会更广泛地发展。
    骨灰护送团团长田崎健作说，他们是代表爱好和平的日本人民护送中国殉难烈士遗骨前来中国的。他说：“这些烈士们都是被日本帝国主义者夺取了宝贵的生命。我们爱好和平的日本人民每想到这些事情，就迫切地要求和贵国人民携起手来，使战争的惨剧不再重演。我们为了实现和平愿望，正在国内为禁止使用原子弹、氢弹和实现裁减军备而努力。我想，这就是安慰殉难烈士的最好方法。”最后，田崎健作代表骨灰护送团请李德全把他们特地从日本带来的一对精致的淡蓝色的宫灯，送到抗日烈士纪念馆，挂在烈士们的灵前。
    高木武三郎表示感谢中国政府对日本战争犯罪分子的宽大处理和中国红十字会协助这些人回到日本。
    接见时在座的有中国红十字会副会长胡兰生，副秘书长林士笑、彭炎等人。
