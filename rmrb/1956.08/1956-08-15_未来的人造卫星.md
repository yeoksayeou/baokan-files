Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 14th: A recent article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" stated that Soviet and American scientists are preparing to launch a batch of artificial Earth satellites during the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958.

After the first artificial satellites are launched, manned artificial satellites, manned interplanetary stations, and finally interplanetary airships will follow. Many scientists believe that the establishment of interplanetary stations can be achieved within the next decade.

How will they be launched?

The article states that artificial satellites may be launched using a three-stage rocket. One foreign scientist's design stipulates that the first and second stages of the rocket will be powered by liquid fuel, and the third stage will be powered by gunpowder. The first stage of the rocket will use up its fuel and detach at an altitude of 50 kilometers, the second stage will detach at an altitude of 200 kilometers, and the third stage will fall off after sending the artificial satellite into its predetermined orbit around the Earth. The total weight of the rocket before launch is about 40 tons, while the satellite itself weighs only a few tens of kilograms. The power of the rocket engine is equal to the power of the entire Dnieper Hydroelectric Station.

How fast will they travel?

Artificial satellites will orbit the Earth at a speed of 8 kilometers per second (completing one revolution around the Earth in one and a half hours) at an altitude of at least 300 kilometers; otherwise, atmospheric resistance will cause them to quickly lose speed and fall. However, since there is also a small amount of air at such high altitudes, the satellite's speed will gradually decrease due to the resistance of this air, and it will eventually fall and burn up in the air like a meteor.

How long will they stay in space?

According to preliminary calculations, the residence time of artificial satellites in space is: about one year at an altitude of 480 kilometers; about two weeks at an altitude of 320 kilometers; and only a few hours at an altitude of 160 kilometers.

What will be their size and weight?

The article points out that artificial satellites will not be too large, because for every kilogram of weight added to the satellite, the entire rocket must be increased by 200 kilograms, of which fuel alone accounts for 160 kilograms. Some scientists believe that it should be a sphere with a diameter of about 300 millimeters, about the size of a basketball; others believe that it should be a cylinder with a diameter of about 300 millimeters. Artificial satellites should rotate around their own axis in order to maintain a fixed position in orbit.

How will they communicate with the ground?

Artificial satellites are equipped with various instruments that are small in size and weight, many of which are made of semiconductors. They will automatically conduct observations in the air and transmit the results to the Earth via radio. All instruments must be sealed, otherwise they will fail due to the strong ionization of the atmosphere at high altitudes.

The outer shell of the satellite should be very light. Some advocate using very thin aluminum, lined with a solid framework. However, some studies require it to have a non-metallic outer shell, so it will be made of plastic. To facilitate observation from the ground, artificial satellites should be silver or milky white.

In order to observe the activities of artificial satellites and receive the materials they send, people need to establish research stations on the ground with extremely complex equipment, including radio direction finders, optical observers, and a series of other instruments that "process" the materials sent by the satellite into codes.

    未来的人造卫星
    新华社莫斯科14日电　“共青团真理报”最近发表的一篇文章说，苏联和美国科学家们正在为1957年—1958年国际地球物理学年期间放出的一批人造地球卫星做准备工作。
    在第一批人造卫星发出以后，将跟着出现有人的人造卫星、有人的星际站，最后是星际飞艇。许多科学家认为，建立星际站在最近十年内就可以实现。
    怎样发射出去？
    文章说，人造卫星可能用三段式火箭发射。有一种外国科学家的设计规定，火箭的第一、二两段用流体燃料发动，第三段用火药发动。火箭的第一段将在五十公里高空处把燃料用完而脱落，第二段在二百公里高空脱落，第三段则在把人造卫星送上预定的环绕地球的轨道以后落掉。火箭在发射前的总重量约为四十吨，而卫星本身只不过是几十公斤。火箭发动机的能力等于整个第聂伯河水电站的能力。
    运行速度如何？
    人造卫星将在至少是三百公里的高空中以每秒八公里的速度绕着地球旋转（一小时半可以绕地球一周），否则大气的阻力会使它很快失去速度而坠落下来。但是，由于在这样的高空中也有少量的空气，卫星的速度将因这些空气的阻力而逐渐降低，最后也会像流星一样坠落下来在空中烧掉。
    在宇宙中停留多久？
    据初步计算，人造卫星在宇宙中停留时间是：四百八十公里高空约为一年；三百二十公里高空约为两星期；一百六十公里高空只能存在几个小时。
    体质和重量怎样？
    文章指出，人造卫星不会太大，因为它每增加一公斤重量，整个火箭就要增加二百公斤，其中单是燃料就要占一百六十公斤。有些科学家认为它应当是直径约为三百公厘的球体，就像篮球那样大；也有人认为它应当是直径约三百公厘的圆柱体。人造卫星应当绕着自己的轴旋转，以便保持运行的确定地位。
    怎样和地面联系？
    人造卫星上设有体积和重量都不大的各种仪器，其中很多都是用半导体作的。它们将在空中自动进行观察，并且把观察结果用无线电传到地球上来。所有仪器必须密封起来，否则，它们将会由于高空大气的强烈离子化作用而失效。
    卫星的外壳应当很轻，有人主张用很薄的铝作，内部衬以坚固的骨架。但是，某些研究要求它具有非金属外壳，因此它将用塑料制成。为了便于在地面观察，人造卫星应当是银色的或是乳白色的。
    为了观察人造卫星的活动和接收它发来的材料，人们在地面上需要建立设备极其复杂的研究站，那里有无线电测位器、光学观测器以及其他一系列把卫星发来的材料“加工”成电码的仪器。
