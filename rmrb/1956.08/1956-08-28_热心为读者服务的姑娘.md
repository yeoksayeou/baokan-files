    A Girl Who Warmly Serves Readers
    Yin Bo
    Comrade Yu Guiqin only came to the Harbin Xinhua Bookstore in March of this year. She firmly remembers the following: for bookstore salespersons, serving the people means always caring about the needs of readers and finding ways to satisfy their requirements. Therefore, in a short period, she has made many achievements and has been praised by readers many times.
    Once, an elderly man came to the store to buy the "Dictionary of Medicine." Unfortunately, this book had just sold out. The old man was very anxious and muttered to himself, "I've wanted to buy this book for a long time, but I could never save enough money. Now that I've finally saved enough, the book is gone. What bad luck!" At this moment, Yu Guiqin walked over from the side and sincerely said, "Grandpa, don't worry. This book will be available soon. You can tell me your address, and I'll notify you when it arrives." The old man felt a glimmer of hope upon hearing this, but he wasn't entirely convinced. He said "120 Badao Street" and left in disappointment.
    Half a month later, the "Dictionary of Medicine" indeed arrived. Yu Guiqin remembered the old man's purchase. However, there are many Badao Streets in Harbin. How could she find 120 Badao Street there? She regretted not being more thorough that day and not asking for the old man's detailed address. She began to hesitate, but then she considered that the old man might be researching traditional Chinese medicine and must be urgently needing this book. Now that the Party has emphasized the importance of developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, how could I not notify him? No, I must notify him!
    The next morning, Yu Guiqin had a day off, and she wanted to use this time to notify him. But the weather wasn't cooperating; it started to rain. She waited in her dormitory for half the day, but the rain didn't stop. She looked at the clock and realized that she would have to go and relieve her shift in a little over an hour. What should she do? She couldn't wait any longer. So, she hurried out the door in the rain. Harbin was still unfamiliar to her, and she hadn't walked many of the streets. Where was 120 Badao Street? She couldn't even figure out the direction. She could only look slowly, asking as she went. After much back and forth, she finally found the "Old and New Badao Streets" and followed the street to find "Number 120." But the residents of this house were knife sharpeners. Why would they buy such a book? Yu Guiqin was happy for a moment, but then came disappointment.
    The rain continued to fall, and her clothes were soaked. Yu Guiqin became somewhat melancholy again. But the scene of the old man buying the book reappeared in her mind. This book must be of great help to the old man's research work on traditional Chinese medicine, or else why would he be so anxious when he couldn't buy it? So, she decided to continue searching. Soon, she found "Daowai Nanxun Badao Street." She immediately cheered up again but was also worried that there would still be no hope. She quickened her pace and looked for the numbers one by one. When she arrived in front of number 120, she saw the old man before she even asked. She excitedly walked in and kindly told the old man that the "Dictionary of Medicine" had arrived.
    The old man was entertaining guests, but at this moment, he was touched by the girl who had come to deliver the news in the rain. He only cared about entertaining Yu Guiqin and almost forgot about his guest.
    When Yu Guiqin returned to the bookstore, it was only a few minutes before she had to relieve her shift. Although she was very tired and her clothes were wet, she felt an unspeakable joy and happiness in her heart. (Attached image)

    热心为读者服务的姑娘
    音波
    于桂琴同志是今年三月才到哈尔滨新华书店的。她牢牢地记住这样一句话：对书店的营业员来说，为人民服务就是时刻关心读者需要，想办法满足读者的要求。因而她在短时期内，就作出了不少成绩，曾多次受到读者的赞扬。
    有一次，一位年迈的老人来门市部购买“医药大辞典”，不巧，这种书刚卖完。老人很着急，自言自语地叨咕着：老早就想买这本书，可钱总凑不够，这回凑齐了，书又没有了，真遭糕！这时于桂琴从旁边走过来，诚恳地说：“老大爷，您别急，这种书很快就能来的，您可以把住址告诉我，来了我就通知您。”老人听她这样一说，虽然感到有些希望，但并不十分相信，说了一声“八道街一百二十号”就扫兴地走了。
    半月之后，“医药大辞典”果然来了。于桂琴就想起了老大爷买书的事。但是哈尔滨有很多八道街，到那里去找这个八道街一百二十号呢？她后悔那天不细致，没有问清楚老人的详细地址。她开始有些踌躇，但又一考虑，那位老人可能是研究中医的，一定急于需要这本书。现在党又强调提出发挥祖国医学遗产，我能不通知他吗？不，一定要通知他的！
    第二天上午于桂琴正好休息，她便想利用这个时间去通知他。但天不作美，又下起雨来了，她在宿舍里等了半天，雨还没有停。她看看表，还有一点多钟就要去换班了，怎么办呢？不能再等下去了。于是她就冒雨急急忙忙地走出门去。哈尔滨对她还是很生疏的，很多街道她根本没有走过。八道街一百二十号在那里呢？连方向都摸不清，她只有慢慢地去找。边走边打听，经过往返周折，终于找到了“新旧八道街”，并顺着街道找到了“一百二十号”。可是这家住户是磨剪子的，怎么会买这样的书呢？于桂琴高兴了半天，继而来的是失望。
    雨还不停地下着，衣服都淋湿了，于桂琴又有些惆怅起来。但老人买书时的情景又浮现在她的眼前了。这本书对老人的中医研究工作，一定有很大帮助，不然为什么买不到他就那样着急呢？于是她决心继续找。不一会，她又找到了个“道外南巡八道街”她马上又高兴起来，但也担心仍然没有希望。她加快脚步，挨号找了下去，到了一百二十号门前，还未等她询问，就看见了那位老人。她兴奋地走了进去，亲切地将“医药大辞典”这本书来了的消息告诉了老人。
    这位老人正在招待客人，但此时却被冒雨为他送讯的姑娘所感动。他只顾招待于桂琴，几乎把那位客人都忘记了。
    当于桂琴回到书店时，差几分钟就该换班了。她虽然很疲倦，衣服也很潮湿，但内心中却觉得有说不出的高兴和愉快。（附图片）
