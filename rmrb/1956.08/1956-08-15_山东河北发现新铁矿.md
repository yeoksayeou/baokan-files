Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: A large iron ore deposit of industrial value has been confirmed in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong Province. Preliminary exploration has shown that the reserves are very abundant. Currently, geological exploration personnel from the Ministry of Geology are conducting large-scale exploration work to further determine the resource situation in the iron ore area.

According to the geological exploration personnel working in this area, there are many favorable conditions for building an iron and steel complex in this iron ore area: not only are there water sources and electricity available, but also various necessary auxiliary materials, such as smelting flux, refractory materials, and even coking coal, can be obtained in the vicinity of the mining area or within Shandong Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 13th: New iron ore deposits have been discovered in Wu'an County, Hebei Province. According to preliminary data, the average iron content of this iron ore is 54.66%, and harmful components such as silicon dioxide, sulfur, and phosphorus are also very low, making it suitable for steelmaking.

The Hebei Provincial Department of Industry has already established a basic construction engineering office in the mining area. Employees of the drilling team are continuing to carry out work on hydrogeological exploration and tunnel exploration. Preparations for mine construction are also underway in full swing.

    山东河北发现新铁矿
    新华社济南13日电　在山东省沂蒙山区已经证实有一个有工业价值的大铁矿；这个铁矿经初步勘探证明，储量十分丰富。目前，为进一步探明铁矿区的资源情况，地质部的地质勘探人员正在进行大规模的勘探工作。
    据在这个地区进行地质勘探的工作人员说，在这个铁矿区建设钢铁联合企业，具有很多有利条件：附近不但有水源和电力可以利用，各种必要的辅助材料，如冶炼熔剂，耐火材料，以至炼焦煤等，也都可以在矿区周围或山东境内获得解决。
    新华社保定13日电　河北省武安县发现了新铁矿。据初步得到的资料证明，这个铁矿平均含铁量为54.66％，而且二氧化矽，硫和磷等有害成分也很少，适合于炼钢用。
    河北省工业厅已经在矿区设立了基本建设工程处。钻探队的职工们，正继续进行关于水文勘探和洞探等工作。建矿的准备工作，也在紧张进行。
