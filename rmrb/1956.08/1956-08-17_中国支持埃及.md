    The Government of the People's Republic of China issued an important statement on the Suez Canal issue on August 15. This statement pointed out that, both legally and morally, the Egyptian government is fully entitled to nationalize the Suez Canal Company; the so-called "management arrangements under international system" is an interference in Egypt's internal affairs and a violation of Egyptian sovereignty. The statement pointed out that the brutal pressure exerted by the United States, Britain, and France on Egypt seriously violates the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law; the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal can be resolved through peaceful consultation. The statement pointed out that the ongoing London conference has no right to make decisions on the Suez Canal issue, let alone discuss issues involving Egyptian sovereignty; the Chinese government supports the Egyptian government's proposal to convene a broad international conference. The content of this statement correctly expresses the Chinese people's sympathy and concern for the just struggle waged by the Egyptian government and people, and their desire and proposition for resolving the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal through consultation and easing the current situation.
    The United States, Britain, and France's crude interference in Egypt's action to nationalize the Suez Canal Company has created tension between the United States, Britain, and France and Egypt, and created a serious situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Suez Canal area. This situation should not have happened at all, and it runs counter to the interests of freedom of navigation in the canal and the interests of peace and security in this region.
    The facts since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company have powerfully demonstrated that Egypt has managed this waterway more effectively than before nationalization, and that nationalization has not only not affected but has better guaranteed the freedom of navigation in the canal. However, the United States, Britain, and France are closing their eyes and dare not face this fact squarely. They insist that the Egyptian government's sovereign act of nationalization endangers freedom of navigation and threatens their "life and strength"; they insist that only international control conforms to the so-called "international nature" of the Suez Canal. They attempt to impose an "international organization" on Egyptian national sovereignty, cancel the nationalization of the canal company, and continue to maintain their colonial exploitation and privileged status.
    In order to achieve this goal, the United States, Britain, and France have adopted high-handed measures against the Egyptian government. They have frozen the Egyptian government's property and funds, and implemented trade restrictions and other economic sanctions. More seriously, they have mobilized land, sea, and air forces, deployed troops in the Eastern Mediterranean, brandishing their swords, showing off their power, and intimidating Egypt. As our government's statement pointed out, this action is not only a threat to Egypt, but also a threat to all countries that demand to get rid of colonial rule and demand to safeguard their sovereignty and independence, and also a threat to world peace and security as a whole.
    World opinion believes that the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, making the Suez Canal the property of the Egyptian state and people again, is completely a legitimate act of an independent sovereign country, and believes that this is already an irreversible fact. At the same time, world opinion is increasingly strongly condemning the actions of the United States, Britain, and France in threatening Egypt and attempting to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. First of all, the Arab countries have shown a spirit of close unity. The Political Committee of the Arab League stated in its resolution that infringing upon the sovereignty of any Arab country is infringing upon the sovereignty of all Arab countries. The socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, firmly support Egypt's just struggle and oppose any interference and threat against Egypt by the United States, Britain, and France. Yugoslavia made a solemn protest against the United States, Britain, and France's show of force and the London conference's ulterior motives. India and many Asian and African countries believe that respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity is an unshakeable principle, and express their indignation and unease about the war preparations and other pressures carried out by the United States, Britain, and France. Countries participating in the Baghdad Pact also expressed support for Egypt's position and opposition to the position of the United States, Britain, and France. What other Western countries are concerned about is also clearly not the restoration of the colonialists' gunboat policy, but the continued free navigation of the Suez Canal. In the struggle over the Suez Canal issue, the United States, Britain, and France are facing not only the 23 million Egyptian people who are determined to fight bravely to safeguard national sovereignty and freedom of navigation in the canal. They are also facing the awakened and united people of the Arab countries, and the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice. Military threats and various brutal pressures cannot intimidate the Egyptian government and people.
    There is no doubt that Egypt is the country most concerned about the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. Egypt has already proven this with concrete actions. Not only that, the Egyptian government has also proposed convening an international conference with the broad participation of relevant countries, in order to consider concluding an agreement to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation in the canal. This shows that although the United States, Britain, and France still insist on their predetermined plans to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs and infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty, the Egyptian government is willing to make every effort to seek possible ways to resolve the complex and serious situation currently arising over the Suez Canal issue. This fully demonstrates the Egyptian government's spirit of attaching importance to peaceful consultation. The planners of the London conference—the United States, Britain, and France—should see the sincere wishes of the Egyptian government and the demands of Asian and African countries and world opinion; only on the basis of fully respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, carrying out peaceful consultations, is the only reasonable way to resolve the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. And in the current situation, it is even more necessary for Britain and France to consider this issue with a more calm and realistic attitude.
    The Chinese people will, together with the Asian and African people and the people of the world, actively support all the efforts made by the Egyptian government and people to realize this proposal and safeguard peace in this region.

### 中国支持埃及

    中国支持埃及
    中华人民共和国政府八月十五日就苏彝士运河问题发表了一项重要声明。这个声明指出，不论从法律上或道义上来说，埃及政府完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有；所谓“在国际制度下的经营安排”是对埃及内政的干涉和对埃及主权的侵犯。这个声明指出，美、英、法三国对埃及所施加的横暴压力，严重地违反了联合国宪章和国际法准则；有关苏彝士运河航行自由的问题能够通过和平协商求得解决。这个声明指出，目前正在举行的伦敦会议没有权利对苏彝士运河问题作出决定，更没有任何权利讨论涉及埃及主权的问题；中国政府支持埃及政府提出的召开广泛性国际会议的建议。这个声明的内容正确地表达了中国人民对埃及政府和人民所进行的正义斗争的同情和关切，对协商解决有关苏彝士运河航行自由问题和缓和目前局势的愿望和主张。
    美、英、法三国粗暴地干涉埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的行动，已经造成了美、英、法三国和埃及之间的紧张关系，造成了东地中海和苏彝士运河区的严重局势。这种情况是完全不应该发生的，是同运河航行自由的利益和这个地区的和平和安全的利益背道而驰的。
    苏彝士运河公司国有化以来的事实有力地证明，埃及已经比国有化之前更加有效地管理着这条水道，国有化不仅一点没有影响到、反而更好地保障了运河的航行自由。但是，美、英、法三国却闭着眼睛，不敢正视这个事实。他们硬说埃及政府的国有化的主权行为危害航行自由，威胁他们的“生命和力量”；硬说只有国际管制才符合所谓苏彝士运河的“国际性质”。他们企图以一种“国际机构”强加于埃及国家主权之上，取消运河公司的国有化，继续维护他们的殖民剥削和特权地位。
    为了达到这个目的，美、英、法三国对埃及政府采取了高压的手段。他们冻结了埃及政府的财产和资金，实行了贸易限制和其他经济制裁的措施。更严重的是：他们调动了陆、海、空军，陈兵东地中海，剑拔弩张，耀武扬威，对埃及进行恫吓。正像我国政府声明所指出，这种行动不仅是对埃及一个国家的威胁，而且是对一切要求摆脱殖民统治、要求维护自己的主权和独立的国家的威胁，也是对整个世界和平和安全的威胁。
    全世界的舆论都认为埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司国有化，使苏彝士运河重新成为埃及国家和人民的财产，完全是一个独立的主权国家的合法行为，并且认为这已经是一个不可改变的事实。同时，全世界的舆论越来越强烈地谴责美、英、法三国威胁埃及和企图干涉埃及内政的行动。首先，阿拉伯国家表现出紧密团结的精神，阿拉伯联盟政治委员会在决议中表示，侵犯任何一个阿拉伯国家的主权，就是侵犯所有阿拉伯国家的主权。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国坚决支持埃及的正义斗争，反对美、英、法三国对埃及的任何干涉和威胁。南斯拉夫对美、英、法三国的炫耀武力和伦敦会议的别有居心，作了严正的抗议。印度和许多亚非国家都认为尊重埃及的主权和尊严是不可动摇的原则，并且对美、英、法三国所进行的战争准备和其他压力表示愤慨和不安。参加巴格达条约的国家也表示支持埃及的立场，反对美、英、法三国的立场。其他西方国家所关心的，也显然不是恢复殖民主义者的炮舰政策，而是苏彝士运河的继续自由航行。在苏彝士运河问题的斗争中，美、英、法三国所面对的，不单是决心为维护国家主权和运河航行自由而英勇奋斗的二千三百万埃及人民。他们还面对着已经觉醒的、团结一致的阿拉伯各国人民，面对着爱好和平和主张正义的全世界人民。武力威胁和各种横暴的压力都吓不倒埃及政府和人民。
    毫无疑问，埃及是最关心苏彝士运河航行自由的国家。埃及已经用具体的行动证明了这一点。不仅如此，埃及政府还建议召开由有关国家广泛参加的国际会议，以便考虑缔结一个协定来重新肯定和保证运河的航行自由。这说明虽然美、英、法三国仍坚持干涉埃及内政和侵犯埃及主权的预定计划，但是埃及政府为了解决目前在苏彝士运河问题上所产生的复杂和严重的局势，却愿意尽一切努力来寻求可能的途径。这充分表现了埃及政府重视和平协商的精神。伦敦会议的策划者——美、英、法三国应该看到埃及政府的这种真诚愿望，看到亚非国家和全世界舆论的要求；只有在充分尊重埃及的主权和尊严的基础上，进行和平协商，这才是解决有关苏彝士运河航行自由的唯一合理的途径。而在目前情况下，英、法两国更有必要用比较冷静和现实的态度来考虑这个问题。
    中国人民将同亚非人民和全世界人民一起，积极支持埃及政府和人民为实现这个建议和维护这个地区的和平所作的一切努力。
