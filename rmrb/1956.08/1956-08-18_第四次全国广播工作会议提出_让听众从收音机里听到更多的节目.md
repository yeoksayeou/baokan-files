    Xinhua News Agency, August 16th. The goal of all broadcasting workers is to let listeners hear more programs on the radio. This was proposed at the Fourth National Broadcasting Conference, which concluded today.
    The conference was held in Beijing from July 25th. More than 50 people, including heads of radio stations from various provinces and cities and related personnel, participated in the conference. The conference focused on studying the work principles and tasks of radio stations.
    The conference believes that radio stations should focus on news and artistic programs, but many radio stations now do not pay enough attention to these two types of programs. In the future, we must first improve news reports, making them more numerous, faster, shorter, and better, and report on everything that the people care about. We must expand the scope of program material, strengthen ties with the masses, pay more attention to people's lives, and provide necessary education. We must also, in the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," frequently introduce ongoing academic debates to listeners, and broadcast more artistic programs in various forms to achieve "Let a hundred flowers bloom."
    The conference criticized the erroneous decision made at the Second National Broadcasting Conference in 1954, which required local radio stations to rebroadcast Central Radio Station programs for the majority of the time. The conference believes that it is necessary for local radio stations to rebroadcast certain programs of the Central Radio Station for a certain period of time, but it is more important to strive to run self-produced programs well. Radio stations with the conditions should also appropriately increase wavelengths, add programs, and extend broadcast time so that listeners can choose to listen to what they like.

    第四次全国广播工作会议提出
    让听众从收音机里听到更多的节目
    新华社16日讯　让听众从收音机里听到更多的节目，是全体广播工作者的奋斗目标。这是今天结束的第四次全国广播工作会议提出来的。
    这次会议从七月二十五日起在北京召开。参加会议的有各省、市广播电台负责人和有关人员五十多人。会议着重研究了广播电台的工作方针和任务。
    会议认为，广播电台应该以新闻性的和文艺性的节目为主，但现在有许多电台对这两种节目不加重视。今后首先要改进新闻报道，做到多、快、短、好，凡是人民关心的事情都应该报道。要扩大节目取材的范围，加强和群众的联系，更多地关心人民生活，并且给予必要的教育。还要根据“百家争鸣”的精神，经常向听众介绍正在进行的学术争论，要更多地播送各种形式的文艺节目，做到“百花齐放”。
    会议指责了1954年召开的第二次全国广播工作会议要求各地电台以多数时间转播中央电台节目的错误决定。会议认为，各地电台以一定时间转播中央电台的某些节目是必要的，但更重要的是努力办好自办节目。有条件的电台还要适当增加波长、增添节目、延长广播时间，使听众们可以选择收听自己喜爱的东西。
