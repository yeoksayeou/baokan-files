Xinhua News Agency, Xilinhot, August 28th. The Mongolian Medicine Academic Research Committee of the Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on the 26th. This organization, dedicated to assisting Mongolian doctors (Lama doctors) in conducting academic research, was established upon the decision of the first Mongolian Medicine Representatives Conference of the Xilin Gol League.

　　Mongolian medicine is an integral part of China's medical heritage. For a long time, Mongolian medicine has played a significant role in protecting the health of people in pastoral areas. It possesses profound medical theories and rich clinical experience. For example, infectious hepatitis and some gynecological ailments occurring on the Xilin Gol grassland are currently treated by Mongolian doctors.

　　After the establishment of the Mongolian Medicine Academic Research Committee, it will specifically assist the more than three hundred Mongolian doctors scattered across the grasslands in carrying out academic research and improving medical techniques. The committee has decided to extensively collect and translate relevant Mongolian medical academic theoretical materials, sort out and research clinical experience, secret prescriptions, and single remedies, and plans to hold Mongolian medicine refresher courses and organize Mongolian doctors from various banners to exchange experiences.

    锡林郭勒盟成立蒙医学术研究委员会
    新华社锡林浩特28日电　内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟蒙医学术研究委员会已在26日成立。这个专门帮助蒙医（喇嘛医）进行学术研究的组织，是锡林郭勒盟第一次蒙医代表会议决定建立的。
    蒙医是中国医学遗产中的组成部分。长期以来，蒙医在保护牧区人民健康方面起着重大作用。它有较深湛的医学理论和丰富的临床经验。例如在锡林郭勒草原上发生的传染性肝炎和妇科的一些疑难病症，目前就是依靠蒙医来治疗的。
    蒙医学术研究委员会成立后，将具体帮助散布在草原上的三百多名蒙古医生展开学术研究，提高医疗技术。这个委员会决定广泛征集、翻译有关蒙医学术理论资料，整理研究临床经验、秘方、单方，并计划举办蒙医进修班，组织各旗蒙古医生交流经验。
