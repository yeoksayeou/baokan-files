Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 12th: Hu Keshi, Director of the Organizing Committee of the First National Junior Games and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered the opening speech at the First National Junior Games today.

Hu Keshi said that the First National Junior Games, which opened today, is a pioneering event in the history of sports in our country. There are 1,816 young male and female athletes participating in this conference. They are young athletes from all regions of the motherland, including twenty ethnic groups.

Hu Keshi said that this conference is a conference to review the achievements of youth sports, and also a mobilization conference. It calls on all young people in the country to exercise, develop their physical and intellectual strength, and cultivate brave, lively, and persevering character and the spirit of collectivism.

This conference is also a propaganda conference. It aims to promote all sectors of society to pay attention to youth sports, promote the development of youth sports, and create conditions for carrying out youth sports. The strength or weakness of young people's physique is related to the future of the motherland, and a healthy physique can be obtained through physical exercise. Therefore, caring about youth sports is caring about the future of the motherland.

Hu Keshi pointed out that the level of sports in our country is still relatively backward. To make our country's sports catch up with the advanced level of the world, it must go through a long period of effort, which requires special attention to the physical exercise of young people. Because today's youth will be the living force that creates new records and catches up with the advanced level of world sports in the future.

Finally, Hu Keshi expressed the hope that young athletes will display the spirit of courage, perseverance, liveliness, agility, unity and friendship, learn from each other, improve their skills, and work hard for the success of the First National Junior Games.

    新华社青岛12日电　全国第一届少年体育运动大会组织委员会主任、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实，今天在全国第一届少年体育运动大会上致开幕词。
    胡克实说，今天开幕的全国第一届少年体育运动大会是我国体育运动历史上的一次创举。参加这次大会的少年男、女运动员有1，816名，他们是来自祖国各个地区包括二十个民族的年轻选手。
    胡克实说，这次大会是检阅少年体育运动成绩的大会，同时也是一个动员大会。它号召全国的少年们都来锻炼身体，发展自己的体力和智力，培养勇敢、活泼、坚毅的性格和集体主义的精神。
    这次大会还是一个宣传大会。它要推动社会各界都来重视少年体育运动，都来促进少年体育运动的发展，都来为开展少年体育运动创设条件。少年体质的强弱关系着祖国的前途，而健壮的体质是可以通过体育锻炼来获得的。因此，关心少年体育运动，就是关心祖国的未来。
    胡克实指出，我国现在体育运动水平还是比较落后的。要使我国的体育运动赶上世界的先进水平，必须经过一个长时间的努力，这就要求特别注重少年的体育锻炼。因为，今天的少年将是明天创造新纪录、赶上世界体育运动先进水平的有生力量。
    胡克实最后希望少年运动员们发挥勇敢坚毅、活泼机敏和团结友爱的精神，互相学习，提高技术，为全国第一届少年体育运动大会的成功而努力。
