Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 22nd: Petroleum exploration personnel searching for oil in the western Ordos Basin have discovered new oil-bearing structures and oil and gas shows this year, adding to the more than ten oil-bearing structures previously discovered in the area. These oil-bearing structures are distributed in the grasslands and loess plateaus near Wuzhong, Lingwu, and Huanxian in Gansu. The newly discovered structures this year are on the eastern and western flanks of a syncline, and are regularly aligned in rows with the previously discovered structures. At the same time, many hand-operated drill holes drilled in the western part of the basin this year encountered gas and oil sands. Gorus, a Soviet petroleum geology expert, who recently returned to Xi'an after assisting the Ministry of Petroleum Industry in inspecting work in the Ordos Basin, and Chinese geological experts, after seeing these exploration results, believe that the discovered oil and gas shows not only have regional distribution characteristics, but also are multi-layered (i.e., strata of all ages may contain oil). This, combined with the newly discovered structures in the area in the past, further illustrates that the western Ordos Basin is a very promising oil-bearing area.

For more than three years since 1950, geological exploration personnel conducted exploration in the southeastern corner of the Ordos Basin and believed that the physical properties of the oil-bearing strata in this area were not good. Based on the advice of Soviet experts, starting in 1953, exploration efforts were shifted to the western part of the basin, where more than ten geological structures suitable for oil storage have been found within three years. Currently, the western part of the basin has more than twenty geological surveying, seismic, ground electrical, and gravity-magnetic teams, focusing on detailed measurement work on the structures that have been found. The Xi'an Petroleum Geological Survey Office also has preliminary plans to send out approximately twice as many various field teams to the area next year as this year, and to bring in a batch of large and medium-sized drilling rigs to drill some reference wells to determine the stratigraphic situation of the basin, structural wells to determine the structural situation, and deep exploration wells. The Hungarian geophysical exploration team, which is assisting our country in petroleum exploration, will soon arrive in the western part of the basin to carry out large-scale exploration work in this area.

### 鄂尔多斯地台西部发现新的储油构造

    鄂尔多斯地台西部发现新的储油构造
    新华社西安22日电　在鄂尔多斯地台西部寻找石油的勘探人员，今年又发现了新的储油构造和油气苗，加上原来在这个地区发现的共达十几个储油构造。这些储油构造分布在甘肃吴忠、灵武和环县附近的草原和黄土高原地带。今年新发现的构造在一条向斜层的东西两翼，和过去发现的构造有规则地并列成排。同时，在地台西部今年打的许多手摇钻的钻孔里，遇到气体和油砂。最近从鄂尔多斯地台帮助石油工业部检查工作后回到西安来的苏联石油地质专家戈鲁斯，和中国地质专家们看到这些勘探成果后认为：发现的这些油气苗不但具有区域性的分布较广的特征，而且是属多层性的（即各时代的地层都可能含油）。这和过去在这个地区新发现的构造联系起来估价，又进一步说明在鄂尔多斯地台西部是很有含油希望的地区。
    1950年以来的三年多时间里，地质勘探人员曾在鄂尔多斯地台东南一隅进行过勘探，认为这个地区含油地层的物理性质不好。根据苏联专家的意见，从1953年起便把勘探力量移到地台西部，三年内在这里已经找到十几个适合储油的地质构造。现在，地台的西部已经有二十几个地质测量、地震、地面电测、重磁力队，集中力量对已经找到的构造进行细测工作。西安石油地质调查处还初步计划明年在这个地区派出比今年约多两倍的各种野外队，还要调进一批大、中型钻机，钻凿一些探明地台地层情况的基准井、探明构造情况的构造井和深探井。帮助我国进行石油勘探工作的匈牙利地球物理勘探队最近将到达地台西部进行工作，准备对这个地区开展较大规模的勘探工作。
