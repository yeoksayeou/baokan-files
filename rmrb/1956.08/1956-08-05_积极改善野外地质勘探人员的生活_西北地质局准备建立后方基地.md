Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram: The Northwest Geological Bureau is actively preparing to establish rear bases for the Geological Bureau in five regions: Lanzhou, Jiuquan, Xi'an, Xining, and Qaidam. This plan was proposed by the Northwest Geological Bureau at the recent Gansu Provincial Trade Union Cadre Meeting.

The more than 7,000 employees of the twenty field geological exploration teams under the Northwest Geological Bureau work for many years scattered in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai, etc., with great mobility. The problems of employee housing and regular family reunions have not been resolved for several years. In order to solve these problems, the Northwest Geological Bureau decided to build 120,000 square meters of dormitories, nurseries, schools and other buildings for employees in the next two years. These buildings not only include a large number of employee dormitories built in the rear base, but also a batch of temporary dormitories built on the exploration site. In order to solve the problem of children of employees entering schools, some nurseries, schools, etc. will be appropriately established in the rear base and on the exploration site. After these dormitories, nurseries and schools are completed next year, they can basically solve the housing problems of field staff and their families, as well as the problem of children of employees entering schools.

In order to take care of field staff so that they can better handle private matters, return home to visit relatives, and solve marriage problems, the Northwest Geological Bureau also decided to extend the original public rest time; wages will be paid as usual during the public rest period. In addition, necessary improvements will also be made in terms of medical care, cultural life, and material supply.

    积极改善野外地质勘探人员的生活
    西北地质局准备建立后方基地
    新华社兰州电　西北地质局正在积极准备在兰州、酒泉、西安、西宁和柴达木等五个地区，建立地质局的后方基地。这项计划是西北地质局在最近召开的甘肃省工会干部会议上提出来的。
    西北地质局所属二十个野外地质勘探队的七千多名职工，长年分散在甘肃、陕西和青海等地工作，流动性很大，职工住房和定期跟家属团聚等问题，几年来一直没有得到解决。为了解决这些问题，西北地质局决定在今明两年里要为职工兴建十二万平方公尺的宿舍、托儿所、学校等建筑物。这些建筑物不但包括在后方基地建设的大批职工宿舍，同时也包括在勘探工地上建设的一批临时性的宿舍。为了解决职工子弟入学问题，在后方基地和勘探工地上，都将适当地建立一些托儿所、学校等。这些宿舍、托儿所和学校在明年建成以后，就可以基本上解决野外工作人员和家属的住房，以及职工子弟入学等问题。
    西北地质局为照顾野外工作人员能更好地处理私事、回家探亲和解决婚姻问题，还决定延长原来的公休时间；公休期内工资照发。此外，在医疗、文化生活以及物资供应方面，也将进行必要的改善。
