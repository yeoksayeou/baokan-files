Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 26th. Agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangxi Province have overcome the drought and basically completed the autumn crop planting work. As of now, the province has planted over 14.2 million mu of autumn crops such as late rice, sweet potatoes, beans, and corn. Including the planned and currently being planted 2 million mu of buckwheat, the total area of autumn crops in the province this year has slightly expanded compared to last year.

In recent days, Jiangxi Province has experienced widespread rainfall. After the rain, agricultural cooperatives in various areas are seizing the opportunity to carry out field management of autumn crops. Generally, agricultural cooperatives have weeded the fields once. Agricultural cooperatives in the southern Jiangxi region have generally weeded the late rice fields twice and applied fertilizer once.

Since June, Jiangxi Province has experienced widespread drought, causing difficulties for planting work. Agricultural cooperatives in various areas vigorously launched a campaign to combat drought and rush-plant autumn crops. Party and government leading organs at the special district and county levels have successively dispatched large numbers of work teams and cadres to rural areas to lead and assist farmers in combating drought. On average, several million farmers across the province have been投入(tóurù - commit; throw into; plunge into; put into operation; invest in) committed to combating drought and rush planting every day. Up to now, most have completed and exceeded the original planting plans for autumn crops.

    江西省农业生产合作社
    战胜干旱完成秋季播种
    新华社南昌26日电　江西省各地农业生产合作社战胜干旱，基本结束秋季作物的播种工作。全省到目前止，已种下的晚稻、红薯、豆类、玉米等秋季作物共一千四百二十多万亩，加上计划和正在播种的二百多万亩荞麦，全省今年秋季作物面积比去年稍有扩大。
    近几天来，江西全省普遍降雨，雨后，各地农业社正抓紧时机进行秋季作物的田间管理，各农业社一般都进行了一次田间耘草、赣南地区的农业社对晚稻田已普遍耘两次草，追施了一道肥料。
    江西省从6月以来曾普遍发生干旱，给播种工作造成困难，各地农业社大力开展了抗旱抢种秋季作物的运动。各专区、县党政领导机关先后派出大批工作组和干部下乡领导和协助农民抗旱。全省平均每天约有几百万农民投入抗旱抢种，到现在止，大都完成和超过原订秋季作物的播种计划。
