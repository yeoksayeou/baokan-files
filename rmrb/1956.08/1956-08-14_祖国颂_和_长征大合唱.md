    "Ode to the Motherland" and "The Long March Chorus"
    Ye Lin

    Since the performances of the large-scale vocal works "Ode to the Motherland" and "The Long March Chorus," different opinions have been debated. Some believe "Ode to the Motherland" is excellent but are relatively disappointed with "The Long March"; others hold the opposite view. These two works have made a rather deep impression on me. They represent two different creative styles, and their strengths and weaknesses, I feel, stand in stark contrast.

    "Ode to the Motherland" has a relatively rigorous musical structure. The author employs four general themes – a "leading theme" of a song of praise nature贯穿 throughout the entire piece, a theme recalling the development of revolutionary history, a theme of the emergence of New China, and a "cheering" theme. The author's treatment of these four musical themes is obviously carefully conceived. They are not simple linked songs but appear alternately and echo each other in different tonalities, possessing an artistic logical force. The use of this large-scale choral form without separate movements can be said to be a new development in our choral art. I find it very gratifying, although it still has certain limitations and cannot delve deeply into and elaborate on each theme. However, it is relatively focused, has greater generalizing power, and can better organize and inspire the audience's emotions. Some say that "Ode to the Motherland" has a good atmosphere, and I think this is greatly related to its rigorous and dramatically developing musical structure.

    The elaborate voice leading, orchestration design, and the full use of modulation in harmony in "Ode to the Motherland" are also obvious advantages of the work. These aspects fully demonstrate the composer's professional talent in musical composition techniques. However, perhaps the author focused too much attention on these aspects and relaxed the factors of melody and lyrics. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall integrity of the chorus, there are also relatively significant defects. It would be untrue to say that this chorus lacks melody; its melody is beautiful and not difficult to understand. However, the regret is that besides the musical content, it does not help people better understand the content of the lyrics. Some people reported that they only understood four lines after singing for a long time. This means that its melodic image is still incomplete. If we further scrutinize the lyrics of this chorus, we can find more shortcomings. In some places, the wording is very far-fetched, such as the opening: "Millennial snow on the top of Changbai Mountain, ten thousand miles of wind and sand on the Northwest Plateau. Motherland, we proudly sing for you." This desolate scene is not enough to describe the current appearance of our motherland, nor is it necessary to "proudly sing" for this "ten thousand miles of wind and sand." In addition, lines such as "See the place our ancestors pioneered, flowing eastward along the river, welcoming the fiery red sun, riding the wind and waves," are also difficult to explain in terms of grammar and logic, being merely a patchwork of unconnected short sentences. It is no wonder that the audience cannot understand it.

    Shi Lemeng's work "The Long March Chorus" expresses another creative style and characteristics. Although only one movement of this chorus has been heard, the author's intentions and the scope of the work can be appreciated. This movement is composed of five parts. First, a heart-stirring and heavy song by the male bass laments the suffering of old China. This section of singing is very substantial, creating the typical mood of an impending thunderstorm at the beginning of the revolution. Then, the Red Army theme, subtly hinting at the melody of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," appears, singing the birth of the people's armed forces in a cordial and powerful way. What I like most is the third section, which is the theme of the people praising the Red Army in a folk song style. It has a strong Shaanxi folk song style, singing the people's mood in the language of folk tunes in a cheerful rhythm. I feel that this section is in the same vein as Xinghai's "New Year Chorus." After that, the Kuomintang's attack immediately follows, and then the Red Army theme reappears, ending with the victorious northward march for resistance against Japan and the ten-thousand-mile Long March.

    These two works of different styles and genres illustrate the possibility of developing composers' creative personalities and different genres of choral works. The first movement of "The Long March" is only the overture to the entire chorus, but from its style and genre, it shows that this is another type of choral genre that is closer to the people. At the same time, it also shows that any musical genre is not just a fixed frame; it should be fully developed and created according to the needs of the theme and the composer's personality.

    However, although the structure of the first movement of "The Long March Chorus" has clear layers, it lacks organic development and connection in the musical structure. It has many good musical fragments, but the coherence is very poor, the design of the voices and the treatment of harmony are also too thin, especially the accompaniment part of the orchestra is written particularly weakly. These problems, I think, are inevitable in the process of exploring and practicing the genre of music.

    As for the simple and profound style of "The Long March," the power of the melody that is approachable and close to folk tunes, I think is a significant advantage of this work. This work has a strong element of language recitation, every line of lyrics can be clearly and powerfully conveyed, and has a strong ideological content. These are all very valuable. Shi Lemeng's works do not pursue a superficial brilliance in melody. The profound emotion hidden in the chapters and sentences can only be appreciated by singing and listening more. I think Shi Lemeng's "Immortal Hero Huang Jiguang" and this "Long March" belong to this type. Using this characteristic in the creation of "The Long March" coincides with the needs of the theme, giving the work a deeper ideological power.

    From the performance of these two large-scale vocal works, it can be appreciated that the creative path of vocal choral genres is broad, and it also allows the free development of creative personalities. At the same time, it is also necessary to learn from each other's strengths, which will enable our creation to achieve more vigorous development.

### “祖国颂”和“长征大合唱”

    “祖国颂”和“长征大合唱”
    叶林
    大型声乐作品“祖国颂”同“长征大合唱”演出了以后，引起了不同意见的争论，有人认为“祖国颂”很好，而对“长征”则比较失望；有些人的意见则恰好相反。这两部作品对我的印象是比较深刻的。它们代表了两种不同的创作风格，它们的长处和短处，我觉得恰好又成为鲜明的对照。
    “祖国颂”有着比较严谨的音乐结构，作者在这里面采用了四个概括性的主题——贯串全曲的颂歌性质的“主导主题”、回忆革命历史发展的主题、新中国出现的主题和“欢呼”主题。作者对这四个音乐主题的处理显然是经过了精心的构思的，它们不是简单的联唱，而是在不同调性上交替出现和相互呼应，具有一种艺术上的逻辑力量。这种不分乐章的大型合唱曲体裁的使用，可以说是我们合唱艺术上的一种新的发展，我觉得是十分可喜的，尽管它还具有一定的局限性，不可能在每个主题上都进行深入的刻划和发挥，但它毕竟是比较集中的，有着较大的概括力量，易于把听众的情绪更好地组织和鼓舞起来。有人说“祖国颂”的气氛很好，我想这和它严谨而具有戏剧性发展的音乐结构有很大的关系。
    “祖国颂”的精工的声部处理、配器设计以及和声上充分发挥转调的力量，也是作品的明显优点，这许多方面都充分地表现了作曲者对音乐创作技巧方面的专业才能。只是，也许作者过多地把注意力集中在这些方面，而对曲调同歌词的因素比较放松了，因此，从整个合唱的完整性方面看来，也同时存在着比较显著的缺陷。如果说，这首合唱的曲调性不强，那是不真实的，它的曲调优美，并不难于理解；但遗憾的是除了音乐上的内容以外，它并没有帮助人更好地理解歌词的内容。有人反映说，唱了半天只听懂了四句。这就是说，它的曲调形象仍然是不完整的。如果我们进一步推敲一下这首合唱的歌词，则可以发现有更多的缺点。有好些地方在词句上十分牵强，像开头的：“长白山顶千年的积雪，西北高原万里风沙。祖国啊，我们骄傲地为你歌唱。”这种苍凉的景象并不足以说明我们祖国今天的风貌，也没有必要为了这种“万里风沙”而“骄傲地歌唱”。此外，又如“看我们祖先开辟的地方，顺江流滚向东方，迎接那火红的太阳，乘风破浪。”等词句，在文理上也很难解释，只不过是一些没有联系的短句的拼凑。这也就难怪听众听不懂了。
    时乐蒙的作品“长征大合唱”则又表现为另一种创作风格和特点。这个大合唱虽然只听到了一个乐章，但也可以体会出作者的意图和作品的规模。这一章是由五个部分组成的，首先是一段男低音动人心魄的沉重的歌唱，咏叹着旧中国的苦难。这一段歌唱是十分有分量的，一开始就创造出了革命前夕的那种霹雷将至的典型情绪。然后，隐伏着“三大纪律，八项注意”曲调的红军主题出现了，它亲切而有力量地歌颂了人民武装的诞生。我最喜欢的还有第三段，这是人民歌颂红军的民歌风的主题，它有着浓厚的陕北民歌的风格，在愉快的节奏中以民间歌调的语言唱出了人民的心情，这一段我觉得和星海的“新年大合唱”的风格是一脉相承的。之后，紧接的一段是反动派的进攻，然后又再次出现了红军的主题，以胜利的北上抗日万里长征来结束。
    这两个不同风格不同体裁的作品说明了作曲家创作个性和不同体裁合唱曲的发展的可能性。“长征”第一章还不过是整个大合唱的序曲，但从它的风格与体裁来看，都说明了这是另一种类型的更为接近民间的合唱体裁，同时也说明了任何音乐体裁都不会仅是一个固定的框子，它完全应该根据主题和作曲家个性的需要来发展和创造。
    不过，“长征大合唱”第一章的结构虽然层次明显，但却缺少音乐结构上有机的发展和联系。它有不少很好的音乐片断，但连贯性很差，声部的设计和和声的处理也嫌单薄，特别是乐队的伴奏部分写得尤为贫弱。这些问题，我想是在乐曲体裁的摸索实践过程中难免会发生的。
    至于“长征”的那种朴实深沉的风格，平易近人而又接近民间音调的那种曲调的力量，我认为正是这个作品的显著优点，这个作品有着强烈的语言朗诵的因素，每一句歌词都能够清晰而有力量地传送出来，并且有着强烈的思想内容。这些都是十分可贵的。时乐蒙的作品并不追求一种旋律上的表面的华采，蕴藏在章句之中的那种深邃的感情，只有多唱多听，才能体会出来。时乐蒙“不朽的英雄黄继光”和这首“长征”，我想都是属于这一类型的。把这种特点使用在“长征”的创作上，正好符合于题材的需要，使作品具有较深的思想力量。
    从这两个大型声乐作品的演出中，可以体会出：声乐合唱体裁的创作道路是广阔的，也容许创作个性的自由发展；同时，相互学习彼此的长处也是必要的，这将可以使我们的创作得到更蓬勃的发展。
