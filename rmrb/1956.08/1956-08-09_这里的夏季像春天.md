    Here, Summer is Like Spring
    Yǐng Chuān
    The summer in Jinan is truly hot. People wave their fans constantly, yet sweat continues to pour down. In such scorching weather, one might think: the workers toiling in the high-temperature workshops of factories, beside the reverberatory furnaces or cupola furnaces, must be so hot they can hardly breathe! However, in the high-temperature workshop of the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory, the scene is entirely different. A rhythmic clapper verse circulates here: "Our workshop is clean and airy, thirst is quenched with soda, heat is relieved with cold ice. Leaders, concerned about heatstroke, hand us iced tomatoes and milk... with artificial rain and mist fans, our summer here is like spring..."
    In the forging workshop, hundreds of pounds of fiery red iron, having been forged the first time, are reheated for the second time. At this moment, the workers can take a break. Some stand beneath the autumn-like breeze of the fans to cool off, others squat by the refrigerator drinking iced milk or eating iced tomatoes. By the time the iron ingots in the furnace reach the required temperature, the sweat on the workers' bodies has long disappeared. In recent days, as the temperature in Jinan has been rising continuously, the mercury in the thermometers in this workshop has been forced to drop by artificial rain. In the foundry workshop, the thermometer on the west wall beside the cupola furnace has not exceeded 32 degrees Celsius since the beginning of this summer. Here, one can hardly see any sweat on the workers' bodies. At the south end of this workshop, there is a small room called the "Cold Air Delivery Room." When the cold air delivery device is turned on for an hour, the workshop temperature can be reduced by 10-13 degrees Celsius.
    Last year, in the forging workshop and foundry workshop of this factory, accidents of workers fainting due to high workshop temperatures occurred. Worker absenteeism was also quite high. This year, attention has been paid to cooling measures, and the worker attendance rate has remained above 98%; the phenomenon of people fainting is no longer seen. Worker Lü Hongjun said: "Producing under such good working conditions, how can we lack enthusiasm!" Many workers have exceeded their quotas. The foundry workshop has the most difficulty in guaranteeing quality in the summer, but the average reject rate of this workshop is only 1.73%, and it has been rated as an advanced workshop in the Jinan Municipal Machinery Industry Inter-factory Competition for two consecutive quarters.

    这里的夏季像春天
    颖川
    济南的夏天，天气真够热的。人们手里的扇子不停地挥着，汗水仍在不住地往下流。在这样炎热的天气里，人们会这样想：工作在工厂高温车间反射炉或冲天炉旁的工人，会热得连气都喘不过来了吧！可是，在济南柴油机厂的高温车间，却是一种完全不同的景象。这里流传着一段快板：“我们的车间，又干净，又透风，渴了有汽水，热了有冷冰。领导上怕我们中暑得病，又把冰镇的西红柿和牛奶递到手中……既有人工造雨，又有喷雾风扇，我们这里的夏季像春天……”
    在锻工车间，几百斤重的炽热的红铁，被锻打完第一火，又重新进行第二遍加热。这时候，工人们可以休息一下。有的便站在像秋风般的风扇下取凉，有的蹲在冰箱旁饮用冰镇牛奶或吃冰镇西红柿。当炉里的铁块烧到需要的温度的时候，工人们身上的汗珠早已消失了。最近几天，济南市的温度不断上升，这个车间里温度计的水银柱，却被人造雨强迫着下降了。在翻砂车间里，冲天炉旁西墙上的那只寒暑表，今年夏天以来一直没有超出过三十二度。在这里，几乎看不到工人们身上有汗珠。这个车间的南头有一座小屋，叫“冷风送风室”。冷风送风器开一小时，车间温度可以降低10—13度。
    去年，这个厂的锻工车间和翻砂车间，因为车间温度高，都曾经发生过工人晕倒的事故。工人缺勤的也相当多。今年重视了降温工作，工人出勤率一直保持在98％以上；晕倒人的现象，再也看不见了。工人吕鸿钧说：“在这样好的劳动条件下生产，劲头怎么能不足呢！”许多工人都突破了定额。翻砂车间在夏季最难保证质量，但这个车间的平均废品率还只有1.73％，连续两个季度被评为济南市机械业厂际竞赛的先进车间。
