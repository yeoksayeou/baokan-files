Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 19th: The Burmese National United Front issued a written statement on August 17th, pointing out that the so-called Sino-Burmese border issue was created by the running dogs of imperialism.

The statement said that the Burmese people hope that the government will implement a firm policy of peaceful neutrality, rather than a vacillating policy.

The leaders of the Burmese National United Front, U Aung Than, Tekin Chit Maung, and U Than Byin, also pointed out at a press conference held that day that the current situation on the Sino-Burmese border should not be regarded as an act of aggression, because the area is still in dispute. Burma can say that the area is theirs, and China can have a different view.

Tekin Chit Maung, leader of the opposition party in the Chamber of Deputies, said: "This matter (the border incident) is very clear. Historically speaking, this issue is unresolved, and we, like the federal government, believe that a peaceful solution can be sought. We also believe that peacefully demarcating a boundary line acceptable to both sides can enhance goodwill and friendship between the two countries."

    缅甸民族团结阵线发表声明
    要求政府实行坚定的中立政策
    指出缅中边境问题是帝国主义走狗制造的
    新华社仰光19日电　缅甸民族团结阵线在八月十七日发表书面声明，指出所谓缅中边境问题是帝国主义的走狗们制造的。
    声明说，缅甸人民希望政府实行坚定的和平中立政策，而不是动摇不定的政策。
    缅甸民族团结阵线领袖吴昂丹、德钦漆貌和吴丹彬在这天举行的记者招待会上还指出，不能认为目前缅中边境上的局势是侵略行动。因为那个地区仍然争执未决。缅甸可以说那个地区是它的，中国可以有不同的看法。
    德钦漆貌是代表院中反对党的领袖，他说：“这件事（边境事件）是很清楚的。从历史上说，这个问题是未解决的，我们跟联邦政府一样认为可以求得和平解决。我们也认为，和平地划定双方都能接受的分界线可以增进两国间的善意和友谊。”
