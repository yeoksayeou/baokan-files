    The Viet Bac Autonomous Region, a new ethnic autonomous region, has been officially established in the Viet Bac mountainous region, where ethnic minorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam live. The Viet Bac Autonomous Region includes the five provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Tuyen Quang (excluding An Binh County), Thai Nguyen (excluding Phu Binh and Pho Yen counties), and Huu Lung County of Bac Giang Province. It covers an area of 26,000 square kilometers, accounting for 8% of the total area of Vietnam and 16% of the area of North Vietnam. More than 790,000 people of more than ten ethnic groups, including Tho, Nung, Viet, Man, Cao Lan, Miao, Zhai, Lo Lo, San Chi, Ai, Guizhou, and Dai, live in the autonomous region.
    The scenery of the Viet Bac mountainous area is very beautiful. It has mountains, water, and plains. Mau Son Mountain is a good summer resort, and Tam Dao, Ba Be Lake, and Tam Thanh Cave are scenic spots. Hidden in the continuous mountains are many precious treasures. It produces various valuable timbers. Coal, gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, nickel, and other mineral deposits are abundant. In addition, it is rich in Amomum villosum, anise, medicinal materials, fungus, mushrooms, tea, peaches, plums, and fragrant pears, and other local products.
    On the vast plains of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, there are many fertile farmlands, which can produce tens of thousands of tons of grain every year. The output of economic crops such as sugar cane, cotton, and peanuts is also very large. Animal husbandry and fisheries are also quite developed.
    At present, the Viet Bac Autonomous Region lacks large-scale industry, but small-scale industry and handicrafts are relatively developed. Women of all ethnic groups here can weave cloth, and there are handicraft workshops for weaving cloth and silk everywhere. Many families have purchased looms. Women of the Tho, Nung, and Man ethnic groups are good at embroidery. Lang Son, Bac Kan, and other provinces are rich in bamboo, and various bamboo tables and chairs produced here sell very well. In addition, small-scale industries such as papermaking, brick and tile making, and pottery in Viet Bac have a long history. The small-scale industry of manufacturing agricultural tools is developing rapidly.
    Transportation in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region is also relatively developed. The Hanoi-Munankwan Railway passes through the autonomous region, and there are also several highways and major rivers. Every year, tens of thousands of tons of timber and local products are transported from the mountainous areas to the plains through the Lo River. The Ky Cung River in Lang Son Province and the Bang Giang River in Cao Bang Province provide convenient conditions for trade between China and Vietnam.
    Due to its superior geographical conditions, the Viet Bac mountainous area has become the birthplace of the Vietnamese revolution and the birthplace of the Vietnamese People's Army, and it is also an important old revolutionary base area during the Anti-Japanese War. The people of all ethnic groups in the Viet Bac region have made great contributions to the Vietnamese revolution and the cause of resistance against the French. Since the victory of the August Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the face of the Viet Bac region has undergone tremendous changes. The farmland and forest wealth that were occupied by French colonialists and feudal landlords in the past have returned to the hands of the peasants. The per capita rice output in the entire region has increased from 185 kg per person in 1948 to 299 kg per person in 1955. In 1955 alone, the value of forest products sold to the state in the entire region was equivalent to 15,000 tons of rice. Now, more than half of the farmers in the region have organized themselves and participated in 14,000 mutual aid teams. Before the August Revolution, almost all the people of the ethnic minorities were illiterate, and there was only one middle school in the entire region. Now, illiteracy has been basically eliminated, and there are already two senior high schools, thirty-eight junior high schools, and five hundred and sixteen primary schools in the entire region, with 50,000 students. Fifteen hospitals have also been established in the autonomous region, and more than 80% of the villages have their own health committees and medical stations. With the establishment of the ethnic autonomous region, the people of all ethnic groups will surely give play to greater enthusiasm and initiative and achieve new and greater achievements in consolidating North Vietnam and striving for the reunification of the motherland.

    富饶和美丽的越北自治区
    在越南民主共和国少数民族聚居的越北山区，一个新的民族自治区——越北自治区正式成立了。越北自治区包括高平、谅山、北?、宣光（安平县除外）太原（富平、普安两县除外）五个省和北江省的友陇县，它的面积达两万六千平方公里，占越南全国面积的8％。占北方面积的16％。自治区内居住着土、侬、越、僈、高朗、苗、寨、倮倮、山及、艾、贵州、傣等十多个民族的七十九万多人民。
    越北山区的风景非常优美。它有山、有水，也有平原。境内的牡山是良好的避暑胜地，三岛，巴贝湖和三清洞是景色秀丽的名胜区。在绵延不断的崇山峻岭中，蕴藏着许多珍贵的财富。这里出产各种贵重木材。煤、金、银、铜、锡、铅、镍等矿藏都很丰富。此外还盛产沙仁、茴香、药材、木耳、香菇、茶叶、桃李和香梨等土特产品。
    在越北自治区广阔的平原上，有着许多肥沃的耕地，每年可出产成千成万吨的粮食。甘蔗、棉花和花生等经济作物产量也很大。畜牧业和渔业也颇为发达。
    目前越北自治区虽然缺乏大工业，但小工业和手工业比较发达。这里的各族妇女都会织布，到处都有织布和织丝绸的手工业作坊，许多家庭购置了织布机。土族、侬族和曼族的妇女擅长刺绣。谅山、北?等省盛产竹材，这里出产的各种竹制桌椅，销路很大。此外，越北的造纸、烧砖瓦、陶器等小工业都有悠久的历史。制造农具的小工业正在迅速地发展。
    越北自治区的交通运输也比较发达。河内——睦南关铁路经过自治区境内，此外还有几条公路和几条大河流。每年有好几万吨木材和土产经过泸江从山区运到平原地区。谅山省的棋拱河和高平省的朋江对于中越两国的贸易往来提供了便利的条件。
    由于拥有优越的地理条件，越北山区成为越南革命的发源地和越南人民军的诞生地，也是抗战时期重要的老根据地。越北区各族人民对于越南革命和抗战事业有着巨大的贡献。在八月革命胜利和越南民主共和国成立以后，越北区的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。过去被法国殖民者和封建地主侵占的耕地和森林财富，已经回到农民的手中了。全区按人口平均计算的大米产量从1948年每人185公斤增长到1955年的每人299公斤。仅在1955年，全区卖给国家的森林产品价值相当于一万五千吨大米。现在，全区一半以上的农户已经组织起来，参加了一万四千个互助组。在八月革命前各少数民族中几乎所有的人民都是文盲，全区仅有一所中学。现在，文盲已经基本上消灭了，全区已经有两所高级中学、三十八所初级中学和五百一十六所小学，学生达五万名。自治区内还设立了十五所医院，80％以上的村庄都有自己的卫生委员会和医疗站。随着民族自治区的成立，各族人民必将发挥更大的积极性和主动性，在巩固北越和争取祖国统一的斗争中取得新的更大的成就。　（周）（附图片）
