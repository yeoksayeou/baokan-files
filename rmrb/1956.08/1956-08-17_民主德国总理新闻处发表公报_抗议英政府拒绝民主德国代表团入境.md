Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 16th. The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic issued a communiqué on the 15th, protesting the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to members of the GDR delegation to the London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue. The communiqué pointed out that the British government's action was unreasonable, as the British government has no right to decide which country can participate in this international conference. At the same time, the meeting to be held in London relates to the 1888 Suez Canal Convention, and Germany is one of the participating countries in this convention. Before Germany is reunified, the GDR is entitled to inherit Germany as one of the two Germanys, and the West Germany, which was invited to attend the meeting, has no right to represent both parts of Germany.

The communiqué concluded: Refusing to issue entry visas to members of the GDR delegation cannot prevent the GDR from supporting the just demands of the Egyptian government and opposing any actions that may infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty and threaten peace.

    抗议英政府拒绝民主德国代表团入境
    新华社柏林16日电　德意志民主共和国总理新闻处十五日发表公报，抗议英国政府拒绝发给民主德国出席讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议的代表团人员以入境签证。公报指出，英国政府的这个行动是无理的，因为英国政府没有权利决定哪一国家能否参加这一国际会议的问题。同时，将在伦敦举行的会议关系到1888年的苏彝士运河公约，而德国是这个公约的参加国之一。在德国恢复统一以前，民主德国是有权继承德国的两个德国之一，应邀出席会议的西德没有权利代表德国的两部分。
    公报最后说：拒绝发给民主德国代表团人员入境签证，不能阻挡民主德国支持埃及政府的正义要求和反对一切可能侵害埃及主权和威胁和平的行动。
