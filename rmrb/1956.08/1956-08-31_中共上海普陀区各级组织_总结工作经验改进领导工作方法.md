Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 30th. The Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai's Putuo District have changed their previous generalized leadership methods.

Putuo District is a concentrated industrial area. Now, the district committee's leaders and general cadres frequently go deep into factory workshops to help grassroots organizations summarize their experiences in a timely manner. If they find that a factory has good political work experience, they organize experience exchange meetings in that factory, then visit relevant personnel, and then hold symposiums to exchange experiences and insights and offer criticisms and suggestions. Recently, they used this method to summarize and exchange some of the work experience of the Party branches in the front spinning workshops of the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory and the state-owned Shanghai Eleventh Cotton Textile Factory, which was welcomed by the grassroots Party organizations. After learning from the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory's experience in organizing brother contracts, the first workshop of the Wah Shing Electric Appliance Factory smoothly formed more than thirty pairs of brother contracts, enabling workers' technical skills to improve more quickly.

Many factory Party organizations have adopted the methods of sending study groups and receiving "foreign students" to exchange Party work experience and improve their leadership work. This year, the No. 1 State Cotton Mill has sent cadres to learn from fraternal factories' experience in carrying out propaganda and mobilization work, organizing workshop production meetings, and has also established irregular contacts with fraternal factories to exchange experience in certain aspects of Party work. Currently, more than fifty factory Party organizations in Putuo District have learned from their experience in improving leadership work.

    中共上海普陀区各级组织
    总结工作经验改进领导工作方法
    据新华社上海30日电　上海普陀区的中国共产党各级组织改变了过去一般化的领导方法。
    普陀区是工业集中的区域。现在区委的领导人员和一般干部，经常深入工厂车间，及时帮助基层组织总结经验。他们发现那个厂有好的政治工作经验，就在那个厂组织经验交流会，然后访问有关人员，再开座谈会，相互交流经验和体会，提出批评建议。最近，他们用这种办法总结和交流了国营上海第二纺织机械厂和国营上海第十一棉纺织厂前纺车间党支部的一些工作经验，受到了基层党组织的欢迎。华生电器厂学习国营上海第二纺织机械厂组织兄弟合同的经验后，第一车间顺利地组成了三十多对兄弟合同，使工人技术水平更快地提高。
    许多工厂党的组织采用派遣学习组和接待“留学生”的方法，交流党的工作经验，改进自己的领导工作。国棉一厂今年已派出干部向兄弟厂学习了开展宣传鼓动工作、组织车间生产会议等工作经验，还和兄弟厂建立了不定期的联系，交换某一方面党的工作的经验。现在，普陀区已有五十多个工厂的党组织学习了他们的改进领导工作的经验。
