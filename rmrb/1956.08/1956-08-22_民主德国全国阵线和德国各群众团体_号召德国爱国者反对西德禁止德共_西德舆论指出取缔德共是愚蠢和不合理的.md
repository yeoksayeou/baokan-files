Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Berlin dispatch: According to TASS, the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a call on August 20th to all German patriots, demanding the immediate cancellation of the West German Federal Constitutional Court's verdict banning the German Communist Party.

The statement, unanimously adopted at the enlarged meeting of the Presidium, pointed out that the banning of the German Communist Party is a warning to every German patriot. This matter concerns not only communists, but also residents of all strata in Germany. At the same time, this is also an event of international significance.

Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Berlin dispatch: According to TASS, August 20th, German mass organizations are protesting the West German government's ban on the German Communist Party and the persecution of democratic organizations.

The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League stated in "Young World Newspaper" that banning the German Communist Party, as well as West Germany's joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and implementing compulsory military service, are against the interests of the youth and all the German people. The Free German Youth League calls on all German young men and women to unite and resolutely fight against the Federal Government's anti-communist measures.

The Federal Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation protested the police's raid on the Bremen office of the Federation. It issued a statement saying, "We demand an immediate end to any persecution of the Democratic Women's Federation and an end to obstructing its work. We demand that, for the sake of our children's interests, the Democratic Women's Federation should be given the freedom to operate in the Federal Republic."

The protest statement of the Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee Federation emphasized that all German patriots, especially workers and working people, should speak out loudly and resolutely protest the banning of the German Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 21st: Bonn dispatch: The chairman of the League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom, Elvers, issued a statement on August 18th opposing the banning of the German Communist Party. The statement said, "Thoughts cannot be eliminated with a big stick... We are not the protectors of the German Communist Party, but we believe that banning the German Communist Party is unreasonable."

The chief writer of Dortmund's "West German Daily" also believes that banning the German Communist Party is completely foolish. This "will inevitably have an adverse effect on the issue of restoring German unity." He also said: "At present, no one knows what impact such an action as banning the Communist Party will have on the internal peace of our country."

The "Baden Globe" and the Social Democratic Party's "New Rhine Newspaper" and "Westphalia Review" also accused the West German Federal Constitutional Court's verdict of banning the German Communist Party as illegal, foolish, and inopportune. The "Westphalia Review" also believes that this verdict has significant implications for the future of the West German government's policies.
