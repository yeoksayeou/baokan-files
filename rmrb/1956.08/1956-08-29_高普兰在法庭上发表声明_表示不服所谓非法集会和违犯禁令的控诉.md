Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 28th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, A.K. Gopalan, leader of the Indian Communist Party's parliamentary group, expressed his disagreement in the Ahmedabad court on August 27th with the charges of illegal assembly and violation of a prohibition order.

The prosecuting authorities stated that Gopalan violated the prohibition order and on August 17th had convened a mass meeting in the Khadia area of Ahmedabad, and delivered a speech despite police warnings.

In a statement to the judge, Gopalan said, "This charge is being forced upon me for the sake of political retaliation."

He accused that his arrest when he was preparing to go to Delhi was "a deliberate attempt to put me in jail before the next election."

He said that he had come to investigate the situation in Ahmedabad. Anyone and everyone could get a curfew pass, "but I alone was not given a pass, and despite being a responsible member of Congress, I was treated like a vagrant child. If the authorities did not want me to move around and speak to anyone, they should have notified me; only if I violated their prohibition order should they have taken action against me."

He explained that on August 17th, the day he was arrested, he had visited the families of martyrs in one area. People gathered around him, and he asked them about the local situation. He said he was unaware of any orders prohibiting gatherings and processions. In fact, some members of Congress have been holding gatherings in certain areas.

The judge announced that the court would reconvene on August 30th.

    高普兰在法庭上发表声明
    表示不服所谓非法集会和违犯禁令的控诉
    据新华社新德里28日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度共产党议会党团领袖阿·库·高普兰8月27日在阿麦达巴法庭上对非法集会和违犯禁令的控诉表示不服。
    检察当局说，高普兰违反禁令，8月17日曾经在阿麦达巴的卡迪亚地方召集群众集会，并且不顾警察的警告发表了演说。
    高普兰在对法官发表的一项声明中说：“把这个罪名硬加在我的头上，是为了进行政治上的报复。”
    他指责说，当他准备前往德里时逮捕他，是“在下次选举以前把我关进监牢的一种蓄意的企图”。
    他说，他是为了考察阿麦达巴的情况而来的。任何人和每一个人都可以得到宵禁通行证，“唯独不给我通行证，而且尽管我是国会的一个负责的议员，却把我当作流浪儿童来看待。如果当局不希望我走动和对任何人说话的话，他们就应该通知我；如果我违犯他们的禁令的话，才对我采取行动”。
    他解释说，在8月17日他被捕那一天，他曾经到过一个地区访问烈士的家属。人们都围着他，他向他们询问关于当地的情况。他说，他不知道有禁止集会和游行的命令。实际上，曾经有些议员一直在某些地区举行集会。
    法官宣布到8月30日再开庭。
