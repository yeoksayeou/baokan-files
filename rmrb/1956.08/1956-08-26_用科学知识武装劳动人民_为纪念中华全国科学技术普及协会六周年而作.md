Arm the Working People with Scientific Knowledge
    -- Written in Commemoration of the Sixth Anniversary of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    Wu Yuzhang, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization

    The wave of "marching towards science" is rising vigorously across the country. The working people's demand for learning scientific and technological knowledge, and the scientific and technological workers' desire to arm the working people with scientific knowledge, have never been as urgent as they are today.

    "We cannot move forward without learning science and technology." This is the universal cry of the working people on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory Science Popularization Association's member workgroup in Hubei Province, in coordination with wage reforms, held seven technical lectures on new technology standards for different types of work, which were enthusiastically welcomed by the workers. Two hundred people attended the fitter's technical lectures. From the start of the course on June 14th until the end, not a single worker was late or left early. During each lesson, not only was the classroom packed, but the doorways and windows were also crowded. After class, whether in the workshop or in the dormitory, workers would take out their new technology standard manuals and read intently or study together during their breaks. The agricultural science and technology lectures at the Hangzhou Farm in Zhejiang Province were widely welcomed by local cadres and farmers, becoming agricultural schools for four townships and twenty-four cooperatives. No matter the weather or how far the journey, the students would come to listen to the lectures. After listening, they would run back more than ten *li* without complaining, showing even more interest than they would in watching a play. Many agricultural cooperative cadres said, "We are willing to go even if it's further away to learn science and technology."

    Scientific and technological workers recognize that arming the working people with scientific knowledge is a glorious task and urgently demand to do science popularization work. Zhao Liangchen and Chen Yongde, technicians from the former Tianjin Power Supply Bureau, regularly gave systematic technical lectures at the Tianjin First Cultural Palace. After being transferred to work in Beijing, they continued to travel to Tianjin on Sundays to give lectures. Professor Zhao Xuetian of Huazhong Institute of Technology, after creating a quick method for mechanical workers to learn how to read drawings, which solved the common difficulty of reading drawings among mechanical workers, this rapid method was universally adopted by mechanical workers across the country. This year, he also created a quick method for mechanical workers to draw. Mr. Yu Boping, a fifty-six-year-old doctor in Suzhou, from the time of the Korean War to Resist America and Aid Korea to the present, has tirelessly given 478 health lectures to workers, farmers, cadres, students, and residents, with a total audience of 126,549 people. Promoting health knowledge to the working people has become his hobby.

    Under the new situation of the broad masses actively learning scientific and technological knowledge, the organizations of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization at all levels, under the leadership of the Party and with the support and cooperation of relevant departments, are actively promoting science popularization work to various factories and mines, and to the countryside.

    Since the beginning of this year, the association's organizational and promotional work has progressed at a rapid pace. With the exception of the two regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, branch organizations of the association have been established in twenty-six provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities directly under the central government across the country. The association's branch organizations, members, and member workgroups in counties and province-administered cities are developing daily. To date, the number of branch organizations has grown from 110 to approximately 500. At the end of 1955, the total number of members in the association was only a little over 38,000, and the number of member workgroups was only a little over 660. However, from April to June of this year, in Shanghai alone, the number of members has increased from 4,500 to 12,200, and the number of member workgroups has increased from 130 to 460. The association's organization is continuing to expand. Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other provinces will universally establish branch organizations in all counties and cities in their respective provinces by the end of this year.

    In the past, the association averaged 10,000 lectures per year, but this year's task is several dozen times more than in previous years. There has been an increase in both rural areas and in the armed forces. Just in terms of workers, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has requested that the association provide four lectures per month for each grassroots club in the trade union system and six lectures per month for each regional club. This task is enormous. In recent months, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the association have taken a series of measures to meet these requirements. Many provinces and cities, in accordance with the association's propaganda policy, combined with production, practical realities, and the needs of the masses, have carried out scientific and technical lectures based on the principles of small size, variety, easy understanding, lively presentation, and voluntary attraction. In the association's grassroots organizations, emphasis is placed on the fact that the association's member workgroups carry out their work independently and autonomously under the leadership of the grassroots factory and mine Party committees and in close cooperation with the grassroots trade unions. In Harbin, many factories can conduct more than ten lectures per month. For example, workers at Factory 449 extended the life of their cutting tools by three to five times after hearing an introduction to the advanced experience of electrical spark purification. After hearing an introduction to the advanced experience of corn milling cutters, the efficiency of milling workers increased by 3.3 times. Tianjin State Cotton Factory No. 4 conducted more than 20 advanced experience exchange meetings, technical studies, and natural science lectures in one month from mid-June to mid-July. All workers in the factory's electrical department participated in a technical study class. They said, "Each lecture is divided into two sessions, each lasting fifty minutes. The class ends before we know it, the time is too short." On July 15, the Shanxi Machinery Factory held twelve lectures in one day, covering forging, riveting, milling, welding, and other subjects. Workers and technicians of all trades came to participate. Since April of this year, Nanjing has begun to promote science popularization work to the grassroots level. By July, the Science Popularization Association had signed cooperation contracts with several major industrial trade unions. 60% of factories with more than 200 people have held scientific and technical lectures and developed association members, and the remaining factories are also developing plans to start conducting them. The organizational work and promotional activities in Shanghai have been widely carried out, and the vast majority of the seventeen industries have been mobilized.

    The association's publishing事业 has also seen great development. This year, in addition to continuing to publish the two periodicals "Science Popularization" and "Science Pictorial," the association has also created two magazines, "Knowledge is Power" and "Learn Science." "Knowledge is Power" (five issues in total) was compiled by the editorial department of the Soviet Labor Reserve Administration's organ "Knowledge is Power" for Chinese young workers. After the publication of the five issues was completed in August of this year, the Chinese Ministry of Labor and the association will continue to publish this magazine in order to make the flower of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people forever flourish. In the first half of this year alone, the association's general association published seventy-five kinds of pamphlets, with a print run of 3,762,000 copies. In order to publish popular science propaganda reading materials more, faster, better, and more economically, and to create visual materials to accompany lectures, the association established the Science Popularization Publishing House and two Science Popularization Visual Materials Factories this year.

    In the past six years, although the association's work has achieved some success under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, both the quality and quantity of work are not up to the needs of the working people for scientific and technological knowledge. This requires us to implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for cultural and artistic and scientific work, to make science popularization work richer and more colorful, and to strive to meet the requirements of the people across the country who are actively learning scientific and technological knowledge.

    Scientific and technological workers, mobilize and shoulder the sacred responsibility of arming the working people with scientific knowledge!

    用科学知识武装劳动人民
    ——为纪念中华全国科学技术普及协会六周年而作
    中华全国科学技术普及协会名誉主席　吴玉章
    “向科学进军”的浪潮，正在全国风起云涌地兴起。劳动人民要求学习科学技术知识，科学技术工作者用科学知识武装劳动人民，都从来没有像今天这样迫切。
    “我们再不学习科学技术就不能前进了。”这是工农业生产战线上劳动人民普遍的呼声。湖北省科普协会江岸机车车辆厂科普会员工作组，配合工资改革，举办了不同工种的七个关于新技术标准的技术讲座，都受到了工人们的热烈欢迎。参加钳工技术讲座听讲的有二百人，从6月14日开课到结束，没有一个工人迟到或早退，在每次上课的时候，不仅教室里挤满了人，就是门口窗口也是拥挤不堪。课后不论在车间或在宿舍里，只要是在休息时间，工人们就把口袋里的新技术标准手册掏出来，聚精会神地阅读或互相研究。浙江杭县农场的农业科学技术讲座，受到当地干部、农民的普遍欢迎，成了四个乡、二十四个社的农业学校。学员们不管天气怎样，路有多远，都赶来听课，听了课跑回去十来里路也不讲苦，比看戏还有兴趣。许多农业社干部说：“学习科学技术就是再远一些，我们也愿意去。”
    科学技术工作者认识到用科学知识武装劳动人民是一项光荣任务，迫切地要求做科学普及工作。前天津市电业局的技术员赵良臣、陈永德同志经常在天津市第一文化宫作系统的技术讲演，他们调到北京工作以后，还照常坚持在星期天赶到天津去讲演。华中工学院赵学田教授，在创造了机械工人速成看图法，解决了机械工人中普遍存在的看图纸的困难后，全国机械工人普遍学习这个速成看图法。今年他又创造了机械工人速成画图法。苏州一位五十六岁的医师俞伯平先生从抗美援朝到现在，不辞辛劳地为工人、农民、干部、学生、居民等作过四百七十八次卫生讲演，听众达十二万六千五百四十九人之多。向劳动人民宣传卫生知识已经成为他的爱好。
    在广大群众积极学习科学技术知识的新的形势下，中华全国科学技术普及协会各级组织，在党的领导和有关部门的支持和合作下，积极地把科学普及工作推向各个厂矿，推向农村。
    今年以来，协会的组织工作和宣传工作都以飞跃的速度进展着。除新疆、西藏两个地区外，全国二十六个省（自治区）和直辖市都建立了协会的分会组织。协会在县、省辖市的支会组织，会员和会员工作组，每日都有新的发展。到目前，支会已由一百一十个发展到约五百个。1955年底，全会会员人数只不过三万八千多人，会员工作组只不过六百六十多个，而今年四月到六月份里，仅上海一市，会员已从四千五百人发展到一万二千二百人，会员工作组已从一百三十个发展到四百六十个。协会的组织还在继续不断地扩大着，湖北、湖南、安徽、江苏、江西等省将在今年年底前在全省县、市普遍建立起支会。
    过去，协会平均每年讲演一万次，而今年的任务则比往年多几十倍。不论农村和部队方面都有增加，仅就职工方面来说，今年全国总工会就要求协会为工会系统的每个基层俱乐部每月讲演四次，每个地区俱乐部每月讲演六次。这个任务是巨大的。近几个月来，全国总工会和协会正为满足这样的要求而采取了一系列的措施。许多省、市按照协会的宣传方针结合生产、结合实际和群众需要，开展以小型多样、通俗易懂、生动活泼、自愿吸引的原则举办科学技术讲演。在协会基层组织中强调协会会员工作组在基层厂矿党委领导下，在基层工会的密切合作下，自主自动地开展工作。哈尔滨的许多工厂每月能进行十次以上的讲演，如四百四十九厂的工人听了电火花纯化先进经验的介绍后，刀具寿命延长三倍到五倍，听了苞米铣刀先进经验的介绍后，铣工效率提高三点三倍。天津国棉四厂6月中旬至7月中旬的一个月内进行了先进经验交流会、技术学习、自然科学讲演等二十多次，这个厂电动部全体工人参加了技术学习班，他们说：“每一次讲课讲两堂，每堂五十分钟，不知不觉就下课了，时间太短。”山西机器厂在7月15日一天时间内举办了锻、铆、铣、焊等十二个讲座，各工种的工人和技术人员都来参加。南京市自今年4月以来，已开始将科学普及工作推向基层，到7月，科普协会已同几个主要产业工会，签订了协作合同，二百人以上的工厂有60％都举办了科学技术讲演，发展了协会会员，其余各厂也正在制定计划开始进行。上海市的组织工作和宣传活动已广泛地开展，十七个产业中绝大部分已经动起来了。
    协会的出版事业也有了很大的发展。今年协会除继续出版“科学大众”和“科学画报”两个刊物外，还创办了“知识就是力量”和“学科学”两种杂志。“知识就是力量”（共五期）是苏联劳动后备总局机关刊物“知识就是力量”编辑部为中国青年工人编的。到今年8月，五期出版完毕后，中国劳动部和协会为使这个中苏人民友谊的花朵永远繁荣下去，将继续出版这个杂志。今年上半年，仅协会总会出版的小册子有七十五种，印数三百七十六万二千册。协会为了更多、更快、更好、更省地出版通俗科学宣传读物和创造配合讲演用的形象资料，分别于今年成立了科学普及出版社和两个科普形象资料厂。
    六年来，协会的工作在各级党委的领导下虽然取得了一些成绩，但无论从工作的质量或数量来说，都赶不上劳动人民对科学技术知识的需要。这就需要我们贯彻中共中央对文化艺术和科学工作所提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，把科学普及工作做得更丰富多采，为满足全国人民积极学习科学技术知识的要求而奋斗。
    科学技术工作者们，动员起来，肩负起用科学知识武装劳动人民的神圣职责！
