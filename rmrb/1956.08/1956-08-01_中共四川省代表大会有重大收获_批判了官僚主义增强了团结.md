Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th: The exposure and criticism of bureaucracy and coercive commandism in leadership work, thereby raising the ideological level of the representatives and further strengthening the unity of the Party, were major gains of the first congress of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province.

This congress was held in Chengdu from July 14th to 26th. The congress promoted democracy. The 715 representatives who attended the meeting seriously discussed the work report of the previous provincial Party committee, and eighty-four people spoke at the meeting (including written speeches). The representatives unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the correct implementation of the policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee by the provincial Party committee over the past year, the basic realization of the primary form of agricultural cooperation throughout the province, the decisive victory achieved in the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, and the achievements made in other aspects of work. At the same time, the representatives also solemnly exposed and criticized the shortcomings and mistakes in the work of the previous provincial Party committee and provincial-level leading organs, as well as the prefectural and municipal Party committees. These shortcomings and errors mainly consisted of the provincial Party committee sometimes neglecting to take into account the interests of the masses when dealing with the relationship between national and individual interests. For example, the growth of workers' wages was not commensurate with the growth of labor productivity, and insufficient attention was paid to workers' welfare. In the work of commerce, taxation, banking, etc., there were instances of deviating from the masses and harming the interests of farmers, such as the existence of capitalist business ideology in commercial work, the erroneous adoption of methods of suppressing prices at each level when purchasing local and special products, and the adoption of coercive command methods when promoting industrial products. This spring, no active measures were taken to solve the difficulties in the lives of a few impoverished farmers in rural areas. When formulating plans or programs, the leading organs lacked a realistic approach of investigation and research, and in the process of criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, some blind and impetuous emotions appeared. In order to strive to achieve an average annual grain production target of 800 jin per mu by 1962, the previous provincial Party committee prescribed several major measures that were too demanding and rushed, such as the promotion of Yin-fang japonica rice and wheeled plows in some areas without adapting to local conditions, which caused or may have caused losses in these areas.

The meeting pointed out that this spring, when the leading organs arranged for the lower levels to formulate production plans, plant double-cropping rice, raise silkworms, eliminate illiteracy, and promote various advanced technologies, they did not make appropriate arrangements according to the importance and urgency of the tasks, did not pay attention to investigation and research, and did not humbly listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres and the masses. Sometimes, they used the work speed of other provinces under different conditions to demand the work of this province, which led to the development of coercive commandism among grassroots cadres. The representatives criticized: The higher authorities are in a hurry to urge tasks and demand figures on the phone, and the lower-level cadres are busy all day long attending meetings, filling out forms, ordering plans, and assigning tasks, and they are afraid of being criticized as "right-leaning conservative" and "lacking national consciousness," so they adopt simple, crude, and coercive methods to complete tasks, which has led to very bad results for many good things and frustrated the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the broad masses.

The congress believes that the reason why the leading organs have bureaucracy and subjectivism is mainly due to the lack of mass viewpoint, lack of concern for the suffering of the masses, lack of in-depth investigation and research into reality and the masses, and one-sidedness in ideological methods. During the congress, the presidium repeatedly solicited opinions from the representatives on the congress. Some representatives believed that the provincial Party committee's work report focused more on reviewing and arranging work, less on conducting in-depth reviews of ideological style, more self-criticism in the congress speeches, and less criticism of the provincial Party committee. After listening to the representatives' opinions, the presidium made improvements. Everyone was encouraged to speak freely. If there were opinions that they did not want to say at the congress, they could say them at the group meetings and then forward them to the presidium. Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, also made a speech at the congress, conducting an in-depth review of some of his own shortcomings and mistakes in leadership thinking and work style, especially his subjective and bureaucratic ideological style. The representatives were satisfied with Li Jingquan's review.

In order to effectively overcome bureaucratic work style, the congress made specific plans in the following aspects and instructed the current provincial Party committee to implement them. These aspects are: improving leadership style, implementing the mass line, correcting coercive commandism; implementing democratic centralism in various organizations, strengthening the supervision of the Party and the masses, strengthening collective leadership and individual responsibility; the main leading comrades of Party committees at all levels should spend a certain amount of time going deep into the lower levels and the masses, streamlining institutions, simplifying official documents, and reducing all unnecessary meetings, so that leading cadres can get rid of red tape and bureaucratism and get out of the office; strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership, improving the theoretical study of cadres, etc.

The congress elected thirty-nine members and thirteen alternate members of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and fifty-three delegates and six alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Before the election, the representatives pointed out that the candidate list for the Eighth National Congress delegates did not adequately consider regional balance, and requested the presidium to make adjustments. The presidium adopted everyone's opinions.

    中共四川省代表大会有重大收获
    批判了官僚主义增强了团结
    新华社成都30日电　揭发和批判了领导工作中的官僚主义和强迫命令作风，从而提高了代表们的思想水平，进一步增强了党的团结，是中国共产党四川省第一次代表大会的重大收获。
    这次大会从七月十四日到二十六日在成都市举行。代表大会发扬了民主，到会的715名代表对前届省委的工作报告进行了认真的讨论，有八十四人在大会上发了言（包括书面发言）。代表们一致对省委一年来正确地执行了党中央的政策方针，全省基本上实现了初级形式的农业合作化，在对手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面取得的决定性胜利以及其他各方面工作取得的成就表示满意。同时，代表们也严肃地揭发和批判了上届省委和省级领导机关以及地委、市委工作中的缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误主要是省委在处置若干国家和个人利益的关系问题上，有时忽略了兼顾群众的利益。如职工工资的增长和劳动生产率的增长不相适应，照顾职工生活福利不够。在商业、税收、银行等工作中都曾有过脱离群众损害农民利益的情况，如商业工作中存在着资本主义经营思想，收购土产和特产品时错误地采取了压级压价办法，推销工业品时采用了强迫命令的方法。今年春天，对农村中少数贫困农民在生活上的困难没有采取积极的措施加以解决。在制定规划或计划时，领导机关缺乏调查研究实事求是的作风，在批判右倾保守思想过程中，又出现了某些盲目急躁情绪。为了争取在1962年达到平均每亩年产粮食八百斤的增产指标，前届省委规定采取的若干主要措施要求过高过急，如在部分地区没有因地制宜地去推广银坊粳稻和带轮犁，因而使这些地区已经或可能遭受损失。
    会上曾指出，今年春天，领导机关向下面布置制定生产计划、种双季稻、养蚕、扫盲、推广各种先进技术等工作的时候，没有根据轻重缓急加以恰当的安排，没有注意调查研究，没有虚心听取下层干部和群众的意见，有时以外地不同条件下的工作速度来要求本省的工作，因而使基层干部的强迫命令作风有所发展。代表们批评说：上面在电话上急着催任务、要数字，下面干部就一天到晚忙于开会、填表、订计划、派任务，又怕被批评为“右倾保守”、“没有国家观念”，就采取了简单粗糙、强迫命令的方法去完成任务，以致使许多好事得到了很坏的结果，挫折了基层干部和广大群众的积极性。
    大会认为，领导机关所以有官僚主义和主观主义作风，主要是由于缺乏群众观点，不关心群众疾苦；缺乏深入实际、深入群众进行调查研究；以及思想方法上的片面性。大会期间，主席团曾几次向代表们征求对大会的意见。有些代表认为省委的工作报告中检查和布置工作较多，从思想作风上进行深刻检查较少，在大会发言中自我检查多，对省委批评少。主席团听取代表们意见后，作了改进。鼓励大家畅所欲言，如果有意见不愿在大会上说的可在小组会上说，再转给主席团。中共四川省委第一书记李井泉也在大会上作了发言，对他自己在领导思想和工作作风上的一些缺点和错误，特别是对主观主义和官僚主义思想作风进行了深入的检查。代表们对李井泉的检查感到满意。
    为了切实地克服官僚主义作风，大会从下面几个方面作了具体规划，责成本届省委加以实现。这几个方面是：改进领导作风，贯彻群众路线，纠正强迫命令作风；在各种组织中贯彻民主集中制，加强党和群众的监督，加强集体领导和个人负责制；各级党委的主要领导同志要有一定时间深入下层、深入群众，精简机构，简化公文，减少一切不必要的会议，使领导干部摆脱文牍主义、事务主义，走出办公室；加强党的政治思想领导，改进干部的理论学习等。
    大会选举了中共四川省委员会的委员三十九人、候补委员十三人和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表五十三人、候补代表六人。在选举之前，代表们提出八大代表候选人在照顾地区上有不够的地方，要求主席团加以调整，主席团采纳了大家的意见。
