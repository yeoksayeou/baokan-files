    China's Largest Cotton Plantation
    First Phase of Construction Basically Completed

    (Our dispatch) The first phase of construction of China's largest cotton plantation, the Anjihai Farm in the Manas River basin of Xinjiang, was basically completed at the end of July. This year, about 120,000 mu of newly reclaimed land will be put into production, planting winter wheat and green manure. In order to enable this farm to quickly go into production, construction began in December last year, concentrating main efforts on building the farm's main artery -- the main canal and some farmland irrigation channels. The earth and stone works of the main canal and more than 40 canal structures such as the canal head intake gate and flood discharge gate were completed at the end of July. The second phase of the project has now begun.

    On August 1, a test water release was conducted on the main canal, and farmland irrigation began. When the canal head gate was raised, the rolling Tianshan snow water, churning with waves, slowly flowed from the main canal into the arid grassland. (Shi Jishi)

    我国最大植棉场
    首期建场工程基本完成
    本报讯　我国最大植棉场——新疆玛纳斯河流域的安集海农场，第一期建场工程，已在七月底基本结束。今年在新开垦的土地中，约有十二万亩地投入生产，将种植冬麦和绿肥。为使这个农场能够迅速投入生产，从去年十二月开始施工，便集中主要力量，先修建农场的大动脉——总干渠和部分农田灌溉渠道。总干渠的土、石方工程和渠首进水闸、排洪闸等渠道建筑物四十余座已在七月底完成。第二期工程现已开始。
    八月一日总干渠进行试验放水，开始灌溉农田，当渠首闸门升起后，滚滚的天山雪水，翻腾着浪花，从总干渠缓缓地流入了干旱的草原。　（史记实）
