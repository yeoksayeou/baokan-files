Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch. Beijing's local industries are currently constructing twelve new factories, expanding more than sixty factories, and carrying out technical transformations in over one hundred and fifty factories.

    Once these factories are completed, they will greatly increase the supply of daily necessities for the people. The Beijing Food Factory's newly built soda water workshop is equipped with automated machinery from the Watson's Soda Water Factory, which was relocated from Shanghai, capable of producing one hundred and twenty bottles of soda water per minute. The Shangyi Fruit Wine Factory, which produces more than twenty types of high-quality wines such as champagne and white wine, will build new factory buildings next to the vineyards in the western suburbs; once completed, its production capacity will increase twofold. The Qinghe Woolen Mill is constructing a serge workshop with the largest production capacity in the country, capable of producing 1.8 million meters of high-quality serge annually. A new wire machine installed in a newly built workshop at the Yanjing Paper Mill can produce twelve tons of high-quality printing paper every day.

    The production of goods needed for national construction has greatly developed this year. The newly built glass factory was designed with the help of experts from the German Democratic Republic, and the equipment is also the latest automated equipment manufactured in the German Democratic Republic. Once this factory is completed, it can produce nineteen tons of glass instruments daily, with a variety of up to three thousand types. A heavy canvas factory is installing machinery, and the heavy canvas produced annually can be made into more than twenty-eight thousand large tents of sixteen square meters for geological exploration workers. Factories producing large quantities of building materials such as cement hollow bricks, marble, and granite are also under construction.

    Farmers will also receive more fertilizer, pesticides, and agricultural tools. The bacterial fertilizer factory, established using old factory buildings, has an annual output of 1,800 tons, enough to fertilize 50 million mu of land for planting cotton and soybeans. The newly built pesticide workshop of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory can produce mercuric acetate for mixing four million tons of wheat seeds, mercuric chlorophenol sulfonate for soaking five million three hundred thousand tons of rice seeds, and ten thousand tons of DDT emulsion annually.

    These factories are being built according to the principle of small investment, great effect, and quick results. The Jianguo Steel Rolling Mill can increase its annual output fourfold by adding and improving equipment on the existing foundation with very little capital. The Chongwen Weaving Factory, which was originally scattered in fifty places for production, can increase its production efficiency threefold after merging, expanding, and carrying out technical transformations. Most of the factories under construction can be put into production this year.

    北京市新建扩建七十多个工厂
    还有一百五十多个工厂正在进行技术改造
    新华社5日讯　北京市地方工业目前正在新建十二个工厂、扩建六十多个工厂，还有一百五十多个工厂正在进行技术改造。
    这些工厂建成以后，将大大增加人民生活日用品的供应。北京市食品厂新建的汽水车间，装置了由上海迁来的屈臣氏汽水厂的自动化机器，一分钟就能生产一百二十瓶汽水。生产香槟、白葡萄等二十多种上等酒的上义果酒厂，要在西郊葡萄园旁建设新厂房；建成以后，生产能力将提高两倍。清河制呢厂正在兴建一座全国生产能力最大的哔叽车间，一年可以生产一百八十万公尺上好的哔叽。燕京造纸厂在一个新建的车间里安装的一台长网机，每天可以生产十二吨上等印刷纸。
    供应国家建设需要的生产，今年有很大发展。新建的玻璃厂是民主德国专家帮助设计的，设备也是民主德国制造的最新式自动化设备。这个厂建成以后，每天能生产十九吨玻璃仪器，品种达三千种。一座重帆布厂正在安装机器，每年生产的重帆布可以制成两万八千多座地质勘探工作人员用的十六平方公尺的大帐篷。建设中的还有大量生产水泥空心砖、大理石、花岗石等建筑材料的工厂。
    农民也将得到更多的肥料、农药和农具。利用旧厂房建立的细菌肥料厂，年产量达一千八百吨，足够给五千万亩种植棉花和大豆的田地施肥。北京市制药厂新建的农药车间一年可以生产拌四百万吨麦种用的醋酸苯汞、浸五百三十万吨稻种的氯酚磺酸汞，还可以生产一万吨滴滴涕乳剂。
    这些工厂是按照投资少、收效大、收效快的原则建设的。建国轧钢厂用很少的资金在旧有的基础上添置和改善设备，年产量就可以提高四倍。崇文织布厂原来分散在五十个地方生产，合并后进行扩建和技术改造，生产效率可以提高三倍。建设的工厂大部分今年都可投入生产。
