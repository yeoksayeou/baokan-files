Response to Criticism

    Letter from the Chinese Communist Party Branch Committee of the China Sundries Export Company: The content of the letter "No Praise for the Good, No Criticism for the Bad" published on the fourth page of the People's Daily on July 28 is consistent with the facts and is of great help in improving our branch work. The branch committee has made a decision: to severely criticize Comrade Sun Liji, order him to make a profound self-criticism to the masses, and set a deadline for correcting his mistakes. In addition, some specific measures have been stipulated to correct our mistakes and shortcomings, in order to invigorate the life of the agency branch.
