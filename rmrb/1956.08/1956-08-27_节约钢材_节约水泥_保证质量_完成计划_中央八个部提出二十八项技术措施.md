Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch. The central eight ministries recently proposed twenty-eight technical measures to save steel and cement, and jointly instructed their subordinate units to earnestly implement them.

The methods stipulated in these measures have proven to be very effective in past practical work and experiments, and can ensure the quality of projects. For some construction projects, "clinker-free cement," which can be manufactured on the construction site, can completely or partially replace cement; steel bars can be cold-treated to save 20% to 35%; and bamboo-reinforced concrete floor slabs can be used to replace steel-reinforced concrete floor slabs, saving 40% to 80% of steel bars.

The joint instructions of the eight ministries stated that the current domestic supply of steel and cement is insufficient. In order to complete as much of this year's capital construction plan as possible and ensure the quality of projects, all units should cooperate when implementing these technical measures. When the units responsible for construction propose suggestions for revising certain designs or changing materials, the units responsible for design and other relevant units should not delay, but should quickly discuss with the construction units and make a decision.

This instruction was jointly issued by the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Building Construction.

    节约钢材　节约水泥　保证质量　完成计划
    中央八个部提出二十八项技术措施
    新华社26日讯　中央八个部最近提出二十八项节约钢材、水泥的技术措施，并且联合指示所属单位认真执行。
    这些措施所规定的方法，在过去实际工作和试验中证明，收效很大，并且能保证工程质量。有些建筑工程，可以用在施工现场就能制造的“无熟料水泥”全部或部分地代替水泥；钢筋经过冷处理，可以节约20％到35％；用竹筋混凝土楼板代替钢筋混凝土楼板，可以节约40％到80％的钢筋。
    八个部的联合指示中说，目前国内钢材、水泥供应不足，为了尽可能地多完成今年的基本建设计划，并保证工程质量，各单位执行这些技术措施时，应协力合作，负责施工的单位提出修改某些设计或变更用料的建议时，负责设计的单位和其它有关单位不应拖延，应迅速和施工单位商议并作出决定。
    这个指示是第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、煤炭工业部、电力工业部、石油工业部、轻工业部、高等教育部和建筑工程部联合发出的。
