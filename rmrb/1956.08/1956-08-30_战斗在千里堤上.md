    Fighting on the Thousand-Li Dike
    By our reporter Wang Lin
    The floods in central Hebei Province overflowed the dikes of the Zhurong River, the Daqing River, and more than a dozen rivers between the two, engulfing tens of millions of mu of crops that were about to be harvested, destroying many villages and towns, and rolling violently into Baiyang Lake. The water level inside the Thousand-Li Dike quickly rose to 11.48 meters. The water surface from Xida'wu to Gufotang in Renqiu County was only one or two centimeters away from the top of the dike. People still clearly remember the disaster caused by the Japanese invaders in 1939, when they breached the dike here to eliminate the anti-Japanese base area in central Hebei. At that time, the water level in the lake was more than 2.5 meters lower than it is now, and it overflowed the dikes of the Ziya River and the lower reaches of the Grand Canal, cut off the Jinpu Railway, and flooded Tianjin. This year, the water level inside the dike is not only five meters higher than outside the dike, but the floodwaters from the breached dikes of the Ziya River system have also created a vast expanse of water outside the dike. The heavy pressure of the high water level inside the lake and the soaking of the water outside the dike put the Thousand-Li Dike in a dangerous situation of "being attacked by water on both sides and fearing wind from all directions." Thousands of meters of the outer slope had slid, and centuries-old dikes had cracked. The lives and property of the people in the vast area east of Baiyang Lake, as well as Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway, were under serious threat.

    At this critical moment, more than 5,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army rushed to the Thousand-Li Dike overnight to wage a tenacious battle against the flood. The entire dike needed to be heightened, and the dangerous sections needed to be reinforced immediately. However, with water on both sides of the dike, dry soil could only be obtained by boat from the "Ancient City" walls twenty miles away, and there were very few boats and tools. But difficulties cannot daunt the people's army. They adopted the method of keeping the tools working without stopping the people, and transported materials day and night. All the officers and soldiers waded through waist-deep water, carrying土bags weighing more than 200 pounds, and climbed up the muddy and steep dike. They got up after falling, and if their feet were pierced by rotten wood and broken tiles, they didn't even look at them, but picked up the土bags and continued to climb. Yin Fengchen, a soldier of the 17th Company of a certain unit, had already injured his shoulders while rescuing the Caohe granary, but he still carried土bags non-stop. Duan Shixiang, a soldier of the 3rd Company of a certain unit, damaged his shoulder while carrying soil, so he simply carried a bag on his back.

      Rows of wooden stakes were quickly driven in near the collapsed dike roots, and newly built secondary dikes appeared on sections of the dike, greatly reducing the danger. However, the flood was not willing to give in. On the night of the 14th, a level 5 northwest wind attacked with heavy rain. On the vast expanse of water, waves two or three feet high rose, and the waves surged forward, frantically impacting the dike. The waves flew over the unfinished secondary dikes and washed away the outer slope of the dike. The situation was extremely dangerous, and some of the laborers in the Baiyang Lake area who had participated in flood relief work for many years were also a little flustered. At this critical moment, all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army demonstrated their excellent combat qualities. In the face of the wind and rain, they fought calmly and bravely with the wind and waves on the dike sections assigned by their leaders. The wind and waves pulled out the windbreak piles of the dike section responsible for by the teaching battalion of a certain unit, and the windbreak firewood was also washed away. Deputy Instructor Li Baoshan took the lead in going into the water, and more than 20 officers and soldiers were knocked down by the wind and waves, but they drilled back up and finally retrieved the stakes in the flood. In places where there were no windbreak piles at all, they jumped into the water, lay on the dike, and used their bodies as stakes to prevent the wind and waves from eroding the dike. The wind and waves knocked them into the lake several times, but they always swam back tenaciously and continued to lie on the dike as before. Others waded to places with trees to cut branches in order to build windbreak walls. If there weren't enough axes, they broke the branches with their hands. Xu Zhen, a soldier of the 3rd Company of a certain unit, after cutting a boatload of branches, still stood in the water and pushed the boat forward. When the instructor asked him to get on the boat, he said, "It doesn't matter if I soak in the water a little longer, as long as our efforts can prevent millions of people from suffering from floods, it doesn't matter if it's colder!" Shao Chengde cut three boatloads of branches continuously. When the leaders asked him to rest, he resolutely said, "My task is to defend the socialist construction of the motherland. Now our industrial cities and transportation lifelines are threatened by floods, how can I rest!" The heroes' tenacious fight finally made the flood lower its head. The Thousand-Li Dike, which was once in a state of paralysis, was not only restored to its original strength in the hands of the heroes, but also became more majestic and taller.

    战斗在千里堤上
    本报记者　王林
    河北中部的洪水，漫过了潴龙河、大清河和这两河之间十几条河流的堤防，吞没了千万亩丰收在望的庄稼，冲毁了不少的村镇，横冲直撞地滚入了白洋淀。千里堤内的水位，迅速地涨到了一一点四八公尺。任丘县境内的西大坞至古佛堂段水面离堤顶只有一两公寸了。人们还清楚地记得，1939年，日本强盗为了消灭冀中抗日根据地，在这里掘堤放水所造成的惨祸。那时淀内的水位比现在低二点五公尺多，就漫过了子牙河和南运河下游的堤防，冲断了津浦铁路，淹了天津市。今年，堤内水位不仅比堤外高五公尺，而且堤外也由子牙河系的决堤洪水，造成了一片汪洋。淀内高水位的重压，淀外水的浸渍，使千里堤处在“两水夹击，四面怕风”的险境。上千公尺的外坡溜沉了，上百年的老堤劈裂了，白洋淀以东广大地区人民的生命财产，和天津市及津浦铁路，处在严重的威胁之下。
    在这千钧一发的时刻，五千多名解放军官兵，连夜赶到了千里堤上，向洪水展开了顽强的搏斗。全部堤防需要加高，险堤更要立即加固。但是，两水夹堤，要用船到二十里外的“古城”城墙上才能取得干土，而且船只、工具很少。但困难难不倒人民的军队，他们采用歇人不歇工具的办法，昼夜抢运。全体官兵都是涉过齐腰的深水，扛着二百多斤重的土袋，爬上泥泞陡峭的大堤。跌倒了爬起来，脚被烂柴碎瓦扎破了，看都不看一眼，背起土袋来继续爬。某部十七连战士尹凤臣，在抢救漕河粮库时，已经压破两肩，但是仍然一刻不停地抢扛土袋。某部三连战士段士详，抬土时肩膀压坏了，他就干脆自己背一袋。
      坍塌的堤根附近，迅速地打上
  了成排的木桩，整段的堤防上，出现了新修的子埝，险情大大减轻了。但是，洪水不甘心低头，在14日夜里，五级的西北风夹着急雨袭来，汪洋万顷的水面上，起了二、三尺高的浪花，后浪推着前浪，发狂似地冲击着大堤。浪花飞过了尚未筑成的子埝，冲刷着大堤的外坡。情况危险万分，在多年参加抢险工作的白洋淀附近地区的民工中，有的人也有些张惶了。在这紧急关头，解放军的全体官兵们，表现出他们优良的战斗素养，在急风骤雨中，在领导上分配的堤段上，沉着而勇敢地和风浪搏斗。某部教导营负责堤段的防风桩，被风浪拔掉，防风柴也漂走了，副教导员李宝山带头下水，二十多名官兵被风浪打下去，又钻上来，终于在洪水中捞出了桩料。在根本没打防风桩的地方，他们就跳入水中，伏在堤上，以身代桩，阻止风浪对堤防的冲刷，风浪几次把他们掀到淀里，他们总是顽强地游回来，照旧伏在堤上。另有一些人为搞好防风墙，涉水到有树的地方去砍树枝，斧头不够用，就用手折。某部三连的战士许珍，在砍满一船树枝之后，仍旧站在水里，推船前进，指导员让他上船，他说：“我让水多泡一会儿不要紧，只要能通过我们的努力，使千百万的群众不受洪水的灾害，再冷点也算不了什么！”邵成德一人连续砍了三船树枝，当领导上让他休息的时候，他坚决地说：“我的任务是保卫祖国的社会主义建设，现在我们的工业城市和交通命脉都受着洪水的威胁，怎么能休息哩！”英雄们的顽强战斗，终于使洪水低头。一度呈现瘫痪状态的千里堤，在英雄们手中，不仅恢复了原来的坚强面貌，而且更加雄伟高大了。
