Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th: Lao news: At the Vientiane talks held on August 2nd, the Royal Lao Government expressed its acceptance of the five-point agenda proposed by the Lao Fighting Units delegation on the same day.

The five-point agenda proposed by the Lao Fighting Units is:

	I. The issue of freedom, democracy, and free participation in elections and campaigning;
	II. The issue of the legitimate interests of the Lao Fighting Units;
	III. The issue of free general elections and a coalition government throughout the country;
	IV. The issue of the path of peace and neutrality and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence;
	V. The issue of resolving the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly peacefully.

Souphanouvong Explains
The Five-Point Agenda

Prince Souphanouvong, the head of the Lao Fighting Units delegation, explained each of the above five points at the meeting. He first spoke about the issue of freedom and democracy, saying that since Laos shook off imperialist rule, the Lao people's deep desire has been to enjoy various democratic freedoms. Although the kingdom's constitution has already made provisions for these rights, they have not yet been implemented. Therefore, he suggested that the Royal Government:

	A. Must ensure that everyone truly enjoys all the most basic democratic freedoms, such as freedom of speech, publication, and assembly.

	B. All citizens who can read and write have the right to run for office, and all male and female citizens have the right to vote.

	C. All democratic reforms that have been implemented in the Lao guerrilla areas and base areas throughout the country during the war of resistance should be legalized.

When explaining the second item on the agenda, Souphanouvong said that the interests of the Lao Fighting Units should be properly resolved. He pointed out that the Lao Fighting Units are a truly patriotic force that has contributed to the cause of fighting for the people's freedom, independence, and happiness, and has received widespread sympathy and support from the people. In accordance with the Geneva Accords, the Royal Government must recognize and guarantee the rights of the Lao Fighting Units' Patriotic Front and other organizations, such as youth, peasant, and women's organizations, to conduct legal activities throughout the country. The Royal Government must guarantee the civil rights of the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel and must not treat them differently. The Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel must be able to participate in political power and professional departments from the central to local levels.

Souphanouvong also demanded that free general elections be held throughout the country in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and that a coalition government be established with the Lao Fighting Units participating in an appropriate position. He said that the most pressing demand of the Lao people at present is to hold free general elections throughout the country in accordance with the Geneva Accords to unify Laos. We feel that the general election in December 1955 did not conform to the spirit of the Geneva Accords because it did not bring all citizens together into a common life.

After the general election, a coalition government must be established, in which the Lao Fighting Units and other parties participate, to complete the cause of national unity.

Regarding the fourth item on the agenda, Souphanouvong said that the Royal Government must resolutely move towards peace and neutrality and sincerely implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. According to the current domestic and international situation, the only way to maintain peace, neutrality, and national unity is to implement a policy of peace and neutrality. There is no other way. By respecting and adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality, we can gradually get rid of the control of foreign reactionary forces and win the help of all countries. In this regard, Cambodia is a valuable example for us. In the past, Cambodia also had many difficulties.

Souphanouvong continued by stating that the resolution of the two-province issue is closely related to the resolution of basic political issues nationwide. On the basis of properly resolving the aforementioned four issues, we are willing to make reasonable concessions on the two-province issue, on the principle of acknowledging that the two provinces belong to the Royal Government system. In order to solve this problem, the pressing issue at present is to stop the conflict in the two provinces on the principle that the troops of all parties remain in their original locations.

Souphanouvong concluded by saying that compared to Cambodia, we have more favorable conditions. In order to realize a policy of peace and neutrality, Laos must sincerely implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, establish friendly relations with other countries, especially neighboring countries, not participate in any military alliances, and not allow foreign countries to establish military bases on Lao territory.

Souphanouvong hoped that the Royal Government and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would carefully study the above-mentioned opinions of the Lao Fighting Units. He also believed that, on the basis of equality, consultation, and mutual concessions, the negotiations between the two sides would definitely achieve good results.

Phouma Accepts
The Five-Point Agenda

At this meeting, after Prince Souphanouvong spoke, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, the head of the Royal Government delegation, then spoke. According to Vientiane Radio, Phouma said that the government accepted and would carefully study the several agenda items proposed by the Lao Fighting Units delegation. In the talks, we will discuss them in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Accords. Regarding the general election of December 25, 1955, we held it in the manner that has always been carried out. We regret that the Lao Fighting Units were unable to participate in this general election. Now, the government is studying the issue of women's suffrage. Regarding the issue of freedom of speech, the government feels that there are no obstacles, as long as the speech is within the scope stipulated by law and the constitution.

Phouma said to the Lao Fighting Units delegation, "I know very well that you have fought for the independence and unity of the motherland. Your cause is the same as our cause. After you return, you will enjoy all rights, and we guarantee that the government will not take any retaliatory action. If there are still questions, the Royal Government agrees to discuss them with the National Assembly to formulate regulations to take care of you and provide guarantees. Regarding the issue of cooperation between the Kingdom and Laos, we can make mutual concessions."

After the meeting, the delegations from both sides greeted each other during the break and took pictures together.

    万象会议双方表示互相让步的意愿
    老挝政府接受寮方所提五项议程
    新华社河内4日电　老挝消息：在八月二日举行的万象会议上，老挝王国政府已经表示接受寮国战斗部队代表团当天提出的会议的五项议程。
    寮国战斗部队方面提出的五项议程是：
    一、自由民主和自由参加选举、竞选的问题；
    二、寮国战斗部队的正当利益问题；
    三、全国范围内的自由普选和联合政府的问题；
    四、和平中立道路同和平共处五项原则的问题；
    五、以和平方式解决桑怒和丰沙里两省的问题。
    苏发努冯解释
    五项议程
    寮国战斗部队代表团团长苏发努冯在会上对以上五点逐一作了解释。他首先讲到自由民主问题说，自从老挝摆脱帝国主义的统治以后，老挝人民的深切愿望是希望享有各种民主自由权利。虽然王国的宪法对这些权利业已作出规定，但是尚未实行。因此，建议王国政府：
    甲、必须使每一个人真正享有如言论、出版、集会等的最普通的一切民主自由权利。
    乙、所有会读会写的公民都有竞选权，所有的男女公民都有选举权。
    丙、在全国各地的寮国游击区和根据地内，在抗战期间已经实行的一切民主改革应得到合法化。
    在解释第二项议程的时候，苏发努冯说，应当妥善地解决寮国战斗部队的利益。他指出，寮国战斗部队是一支真正爱国的力量，曾经为争取人民的自由、独立和幸福的斗争事业作出了贡献，得到人民的广泛同情和支持。按照日内瓦协定，王国政府必须承认和保证寮国战斗部队方面的爱国战线和其他各个组织，如青年、农民、妇女等组织在全国各地进行合法活动的权利。王国政府必须保证寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员的公民权利，不得分别对待。寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员必须能够参加从中央到地方上的政权和专业部门。
    苏发努冯还要求按照日内瓦协定在全国范围内进行自由普选和成立有寮国战斗部队以适当的地位参加的联合政府。他说，老挝人民目前最迫切的要求，是按照日内瓦协定在全国范围内进行自由普选，来统一老挝，我们觉得1955年12月的普选不符合日内瓦协定的精神，因为它并没有把所有公民集合到共同生活里来。
    在普选以后，必须成立联合政府，其中有寮国战斗部队和其他党派参加，以完成祖国的统一事业。
    关于第四项议程，苏发努冯说，王国政府必须坚决走向和平中立，并且诚恳地实行和平共处的五项原则。根据目前的国内外形势，维护和平、中立和国家统一的唯一办法是执行和平中立的政策。除此以外，没有任何其他道路。尊重和奉行和平中立政策，我们就能逐渐摆脱外国反动势力的支配，并且能争取各国的帮助。在这方面，柬埔寨是我们的一个宝贵的榜样。过去柬埔寨也有许多困难。
    苏发努冯接着说，两省问题的解决是和全国性的基本政治问题的解决有着密切关系的。在适当地解决前述四个问题的基础上，我们愿意在承认两省是属于王国政府系统的原则上，就两省问题作出合情合理的让步。为了解决这个问题，目前的迫切问题是要在各方部队保存原地的原则上，停止两省内的冲突。
    苏发努冯最后说，和柬埔寨比起来，我们有着更多顺利的条件。为了实现和平中立政策，老挝必须诚恳地实行和平共处五项原则，和其他国家、尤其是邻近国家建立友好关系，不要参加任何军事联盟，并且不让外国在老挝领土上建立军事根据地。
    苏发努冯希望王国政府和梭发那·富马首相详细研究寮国战斗部队的上述意见。他并且相信，在平等、协商和互相让步的基础上，双方的谈判一定会获得良好的结果。
    富马首相接受
    五项议程
    在这次会议上，在苏发努冯亲王发言以后，王国政府代表团团长梭发那·富马首相接着发言。据万象电台广播，富马说，政府接受并且将仔细研究寮国战斗部队代表团所提出的几项议程。在会谈中，我们将根据日内瓦协定的条款来讨论。关于1955年12月25日的普选，我们是按照一向所进行的方式举行的。我们觉得遗憾的是寮国战斗部队方面没有能够参加这一次普选。现在，政府正在研究妇女有选举权的问题。对于言论自由问题，政府觉得没有任何阻碍，只要言论是在法律和宪法所规定的范围之内。
    富马向寮国战斗部队代表团说，我深知各位已经为祖国的独立和统一而斗争。各位的事业和我们的事业一样。在各位回来以后，各位将享有一切权利，我们保证政府没有任何报复的行动。如果还有疑问，王国政府同意和国民议会进行讨论，以制定照管各位和给以保障的条例。对于王国和寮国之间的合作问题，我们可以互相让步。
    会后，双方代表团在休息时互相问好，并且在一起照了相。
