Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 8th. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently summarized its work for the first half of the year, carefully examined the deviations existing in its work, and realistically arranged the construction plan for the second half of the year.

The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is responsible for the construction tasks of the two major railway trunk lines, Lanxin and Baolan. At the beginning of this year, when opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, the enthusiasm of the cadres was greatly enhanced, but at the same time, there was also a tendency to simply pursue the speed of track laying, without fully considering design documents, material supply, and construction force and other objective conditions. For example, on the Lanxin Railway, although the Engineering Bureau concentrated a great deal of effort to lay rails to Yumen ahead of schedule, due to difficulties in subjective and objective conditions, the roadbed width in some places was not sufficient; slope protection and retaining walls in many work sites could not be built in time; most of the station buildings along the line and the ancillary facilities adapted to the track-laying project were also not built in time due to problems in design, construction, and material supply. Therefore, this section of the line could not be quickly handed over for operation after the track laying was completed. Due to the original plan being unrealistic, the First Engineering Bureau only completed about 30% of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

After summarizing the losses caused by the overly ambitious plan, the First Engineering Bureau revised the construction plan for the second half of the year. The original plan was to lay tracks to Dijiatai on the Baolan Railway by "August 1st." Now, according to the actual situation, it is considered impossible to achieve, and the construction period has been postponed. Several dedicated lines originally included in this year's track-laying plan have not yet had their survey dates determined and cannot be constructed in the second half of the year, so they have also been reduced from the original plan.

When rearranging the construction plan for the second half of the year, the leading cadres of the First Engineering Bureau also fully noted the possibility of re-emergence of right-leaning conservative tendencies after the plan was revised, so they particularly emphasized giving play to positive factors and tapping potential. They had separately investigated the potential of labor, material supply, construction machinery, and transportation force, and actively strived for local government assistance to solve a part of the insufficient transportation tools and labor. Recently, the Engineering Bureau also held a cement-saving experience exchange meeting, and plans to promote more than a dozen advanced experiences in saving cement in the second half of the year to overcome the difficulties caused by the untimely supply of cement. A batch of small machinery that has been abandoned for several years will also be gradually put into use in the project in the second half of the year.

    采取实事求是的态度，纠正计划偏高的毛病
    铁道部第一工程局重新安排计划
    新华社兰州8日电　铁道部第一工程局最近总结了上半年的工作，认真检查了工作中存在的偏向，并且实事求是地安排了下半年的施工计划。
    铁道部第一工程局担负着兰新、包兰两大铁路干线的修筑任务。在今年年初反对右倾保守思想的时候，干部的积极性是大大提高了，但是同时也产生了单纯追求铺轨进度的偏向，不充分考虑设计文件、材料的供应情况和施工力量等客观条件。例如兰新路，工程局虽然集中了很大力量把钢轨提前铺到玉门，但是，由于主观条件和客观条件存在着困难，有些地方路基宽度没有修够；许多工点的护坡、挡土墙不能及时建筑；沿线大部分站场房屋和铺轨工程相适应的附属设备，也因为设计、施工和材料供应方面存在着问题，没有及时修筑起来。因此，这段线路在铺轨完成以后仍然不能很快移交营业。由于原计划不切合实际，第一工程局在上半年里，整个工程只完成了年度计划的30％左右。
    第一工程局在总结了由于计划偏高给工作带来损失的情况以后，重新修改了下半年的施工计划。原计划包兰铁路要在“八一”铺轨到狄家台。现在，根据实际情况认为不可能做到，已经把工期延后了。原列入今年铺轨计划的若干条专用线，勘测日期至今还没有确定，下半年不可能施工，因此也从原计划中削减掉了。
    在重新安排下半年施工计划的时候，第一工程局领导干部也充分注意到在修改计划以后可能重新产生右倾保守的倾向，所以特别强调发挥积极因素，挖掘潜力。他们曾经分别对劳动力、材料供应、施工机械、运输力量等方面的潜力，进行了摸底，并且主动争取地方政府帮助解决了一部分不足的运输工具和劳动力。最近工程局又召开了节约水泥的经验交流会议，下半年准备推广十多种节约水泥的先进经验，以克服水泥供应不及时所造成的困难。几年来弃置不用的一批小型机械，下半年也将陆续用到工程上去。
