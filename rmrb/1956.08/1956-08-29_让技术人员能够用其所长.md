    Let Technical Personnel Use Their Strengths
    Zhu Li
    One of the important contents of the Party and the state's policy on intellectuals is to place specialized talents in the places where the country needs them most, so that specialized talents can exert their expertise for the benefit of the country. In our country's socialist construction, the job assignments for many technical personnel in many departments are appropriate, enabling them to use what they have learned and exert their expertise. However, there are also cases where some units have not assigned some technical personnel appropriately, causing them to use something other than what they have learned, and to not use their strengths.
    For technical personnel whose job assignments are not appropriate, adjustments should be actively carried out in a planned way to give play to their expertise that is beneficial to the country. However, the leaders of some units are unwilling to make adjustments, worrying that this adjustment will cause "people's minds to wander and the world to be in chaos," fearing that adjusting this cadre will make other cadres uneasy, which would be terrible! When they have to negotiate with relevant departments for replacement, they are afraid of transferring out good cadres and not getting good ones in return. If they were to simply transfer them out, they would be even more unwilling to suffer such a "loss."
    This kind of thinking that fears "people's minds wandering and the world being in chaos" is an underestimation of the cadres' level of awareness, and it is a conservative thought. The kind of thinking that fears "suffering losses" and is unwilling to transfer or send cadres is a departmentalism that only sees the interests of its own department and not the overall interests of the country. These erroneous thoughts are certainly wrong. Indeed, the facts are not as bad as they think. Please look at the following example:
    After the leading personnel of the State Construction Commission and the Party Committee of their agency organized the cadres of the agency to study Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the issue of intellectuals, they carried out a series of work and found that among all the technical cadres in their agency, the job assignments of 10.9% of them were inappropriate. Therefore, they decided to take three measures to solve the problem: first, to make adjustments between the internal bureaus so that these technical cadres' learning and application are basically consistent. Second, for technical cadres who do not have suitable jobs in their own departments but can exert their expertise when transferred to other departments, they negotiate and exchange with other departments. The conditions for exchange they proposed were quite broad, and economic, foreign language or administrative cadres, etc., could be exchanged, which made it easier for the departments concerned to exchange. For individual units that really could not exchange cadres, they simply adopted the method of transferring them out. Third, for those whose work is indeed needed, but no more suitable person can be found to take on this work, they can only choose technical cadres who are close to it to take on the task, so that they can learn and improve from their work. For these technical cadres, the situation and the rationale are explained clearly, and they are educated to work with peace of mind.
    As a result of the State Construction Commission's actions, the technical cadres who had their jobs adjusted were satisfied and had high morale; the technical cadres who could not be transferred due to work needs were generally settled down after persuasion and education and care in their work; other cadres did not have "wandering minds," let alone "the world being in chaos." Everyone only had opinions about the inappropriate use of cadres in the past, and strongly supported this adjustment of cadres. As for the matter of exchanging cadres with relevant departments, although it was more troublesome, as long as the leading comrades of both sides negotiated well and the personnel departments of both sides cooperated closely, things were still not too difficult to handle.
    The first phase of the State Construction Commission's adjustment work for technical cadres has come to an end, but they have found that the situation of some cadres being inappropriately assigned still exists, and they are still paying attention to solving it. What they are doing is very good, and their experience is worth learning from by other departments. Those comrades who have conservative and departmentalist ideas should accept their experience, overcome their erroneous ideas, and earnestly implement the Party and the state's policy on intellectuals.

    让技术人员能够用其所长
    朱力
    把专门人材用在国家最需要的地方，使专门人材能够发挥他们对于国家有益的专长，这是党和国家关于知识分子的政策中的重要内容之一。在我国的社会主义建设当中，许多部门对于许多技术人员的工作分配是恰当的，是能够用其所学和能够发挥他们的专长的。但是，有些单位对有些技术人员的工作分配得不恰当，使他们学非所用，用非所长的情形也是有的。
    对于技术人员的工作分配得不恰当，那就应该有计划地积极地进行调整，以发挥他们对于国家有益的专长。可是，有些单位的领导人员却不愿意进行调整，他们耽心这一调整就会“人心思动，天下大乱”，怕调整了这个干部，其他的干部也会不安心工作，那怎么得了！要跟有关部门协商调换，他们又怕把好干部调出去，换不回好的来。要干脆输送出去吧，那他们是更不愿意这样“吃亏”的。
    这种怕“人心思动，天下大乱”的思想，是对干部的觉悟程度估计不足，是一种保守思想。那种怕“吃亏”而不愿意调换干部也不愿意输送干部的思想，是只看到本部门的利益而没有看到国家的整体利益的本位主义思想。这些错误思想当然都是不对的。的确，事实并不像他们所想的那样坏，不信请看下面这个例子吧：
    国家建设委员会的领导人员和他们机关的党委，在组织机关干部学习了周恩来同志关于知识分子问题的报告以后，进行了一系列的工作，检查出他们这个机关的全体技术干部中，有10.9％的人工作分配得不适当。于是他们便决定采取三个办法来解决：一是在内部各局之间进行调整，使这些技术干部学用基本上一致。二是在本部门没有适当工作，调到别的部门可以发挥专长的技术干部，就跟别的部门协商调换。他们提出的调换条件是相当宽的，经济、外文或行政干部等都可以换，这样，有关部门换起来也比较方便。对于个别单位确实不能互换干部的，他们就干脆采取了输送出去的办法。三是工作的确需要、但又找不到更适合的人来担任这种工作，只能选择跟它相近的技术干部来担负，使他从工作中学习、提高。对于这些技术干部，就讲清情况和道理，教育他们安心工作。
    国家建设委员会这样作的结果，调整了工作的技术干部心满意足，工作情绪很高；因工作需要而不能调动的技术干部，经过说服教育和在工作中给予关怀，一般的也安下心来了；其他干部也并没有“人心思动”，更没有“天下大乱”，大家只是对过去使用干部不恰当有意见，对这次调整干部非常拥护。至于跟有关部门调换干部的事，虽然比较麻烦，但只要双方领导同志协商好，双方的人事部门密切配合，事情也还是不太难办的。
    国家建设委员会对技术干部的调整工作第一期已告结束，但他们发现某些干部分配不当的情况仍然存在，他们也还在注意解决。他们这样做是非常好的，他们的经验是值得别的部门记取的。那些有着保守主义和本位主义思想的同志们，更应该接受他们的经验，克服自己的错误思想，认真执行党和国家关于知识分子的政策。
