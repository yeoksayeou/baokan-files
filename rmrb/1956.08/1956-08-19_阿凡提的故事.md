The Story of Afanti

Nasruddin Afanti is a legendary figure widely known in various regions of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In the legends, Nasruddin Afanti is portrayed as an ordinary peasant who is exceptionally intelligent, witty, and humorous. He often rides a donkey to right injustices and is respected by the people for his courage to resist the rulers. Stories about him exist among the Uygur, Kazakh, and Uzbek ethnic groups.

Wisdom

Someone boasted to Afanti about a Qazi [note] who had recently moved into their neighborhood, saying:

“He is a very clever and wise man.”

“Possibly,” said Afanti, “because he rarely uses his wisdom, his mind is full of it.”

[Note]: A Qazi is a person who judges residents' disputes according to Islamic classics.

Child's Prayer

One day, Afanti went out and saw a group of parents leading a group of primary school students. He asked:

“Where are you taking the students?”

“We are going to pray for rain,” said a parent.

“Are you using the children to pray to God for rain?”

“Yes, children who are minors are innocent, and their prayers are powerful.”

“Not necessarily,” said Afanti, “if children’s prayers were powerful, then not a single Khalifa [note] in the school would survive.”

[Note] Khalifa: a teacher in the school who teaches religious classes.

Willing...

Afanti came to an orchard and wanted to steal some fruit to eat, so he went inside. He looked at the fruit and said to himself:

“Please, Mr. Nasruddin, if you want to eat apricots, eat apricots; if you want to eat peaches, eat peaches; if you want to eat apples, eat apples!” Before he finished speaking, the gardener slapped him in the face from behind. Afanti retorted, "Then if you want to eat slaps, eat slaps!"

After speaking, he left.

I’m Asleep

Once, Afanti and a friend were lying down to sleep. His friend tugged at Afanti’s sleeve and said:

“Afanti!”

“Yes!”

“Aren’t you asleep?”

“What do you want to say?”

“I want to borrow some money from you,” said the friend.

“No, I’m asleep.” Saying this, Afanti began to snore.

    阿凡提的故事
    纳斯尔丁·阿凡提，是流传在新疆维吾尔自治区各地的传说中的人物。在传说中的纳斯尔丁·阿凡提是这样一个人物：他是最聪明、机智、幽默的一个普通的农民；他经常骑着一头毛驴在外面打抱不平，因为敢于反抗统治者，受到群众的尊敬。在维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克等民族中，都有关于他的故事。
    智慧
    有人向阿凡提吹嘘新近来到他们住区的喀孜〔注〕说：
    “他是一个很聪明，很有智慧的人。”
    “可能的，”阿凡提说：“因为他很少用他的智慧，所以他脑子充满了智慧。”
    〔注〕：喀孜是按照伊斯兰教经典裁判居民的纠纷的人。
    孩子的祷告
    一天，阿凡提出门，在门口看见一群家长带着一群小学生走过，就问：
    “你们带着学生上哪里去呀？”
    “我们去求雨。”一个家长说。
    “是利用孩子向上帝求雨吗？”
    “是呀，未成年的孩子是无罪的，他们的祷告是有力量的。”
    “未见得吧，”阿凡提说：“要是孩子的祷告有力量的话，那么学校里的哈里发〔注〕就一个也活不成了。”
    〔注〕哈里发，学校里教宗教课的教员。
    愿意……
    阿凡提来到一个果园旁边，想偷几个果子吃，就进去了。他看着果子自言自语地说：
    “请吧，纳斯尔丁先生，你愿意吃杏就吃杏，愿意吃桃就吃桃，愿意吃苹果就吃苹果吧！”话还没说完，园丁从他身后就打了他一个嘴巴。阿凡提接口说：“那么你愿意吃嘴巴的话就吃嘴巴吧！”
    说完，就走了。
    我睡着了
    有一回，阿凡提和他的一个朋友躺在一处睡觉，他那朋友拉拉阿凡提的衣襟说：
    “阿凡提！”
    “哎！”
    “你没睡着吗？”
    “你想说什么？”
    “我想跟你借点钱。”朋友说。
    “不，我睡着了。”说着，阿凡提就打起呼噜来了。
              （李提甫、乔家儒、陈桂兰、刘宗诚译）
