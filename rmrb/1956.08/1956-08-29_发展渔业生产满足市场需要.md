Guangdong Coastal Fishery Cooperatives Launch Technical Reform Movement

    In the past six months, fishery production cooperatives along the coast of Guangdong Province have launched a technical reform movement, promoting more than ten advanced technologies and experiences related to improved fishing nets, tools, and operating methods.

    All large trawlers in the Zhanjiang Special District and the vast majority of fishing boats in the Shantou, Huiyang Special Districts, and Hainan Administrative Region have been equipped with "ceiling nets" (天井网). Mud filter nets (滤泥网), funnel nets (漏斗网), and bow sheaves have also been used on most fishing boats. During the spring and summer fishing seasons this year, fishing boats that have been modified with ceiling nets generally increased production by more than 15%. Some fishing boats on Hainan Island increased production by 30% compared to before using ceiling nets. The installation of bow sheaves on trawlers not only saves two laborers but also improves work efficiency. Fishermen reflect: Technical reform really solves problems!

    The Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Department has established technical guidance stations in major coastal counties and fishing ports this year to help fishermen promote advanced technologies. Various fishing areas have also summarized and promoted advanced experiences in fishery production through visits, broadcasts, exhibitions of physical objects, and large-scale fisherman training classes.

Repair and Build Ships to Welcome the Fishing Season

    Before the upcoming autumn fishing season, fishery cooperatives in various coastal areas of Guangdong have built and repaired a large number of new and old fishing boats. According to recent incomplete statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Department, about 760 new ships have been built, of which more than 270 are large and medium-sized fishing boats with a deadweight of 400 to 1,000 dan (石担), more than double the number of ships built throughout last year.

    The scale of ship repairs this year is also larger than in previous years. The vast majority of fishing boats in the Shantou, Zhanjiang, and other special districts have been renovated, with numbers exceeding one thousand. Many new and old fishing boats have already been put into production in the Shanwei fishing ground, where the autumn fishing season comes earlier.

    More than 93% of fishermen in coastal Guangdong have joined cooperatives this year. To support fishermen in developing production, the state has allocated more than 24 million yuan in fishery loans this year, nearly double that of last year. In addition, relevant departments in coastal areas also allocated timber and other materials early for shipbuilding and repair. It is estimated that more than 1,400 new ships will be built throughout the province this year.

Fujian Holds Coastal Work Conference to Study Fishery Production Issues

    The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a work conference in coastal areas from the 8th to the 19th, focusing on studying the development of fishery production.

    During the spring fishing season this year, Fujian experienced frequent strong winds, which affected fishermen's ability to go out to sea, resulting in a slight decrease in the amount of fish caught in the first half of the year. Fishermen are currently facing many difficulties in production and life. In reviewing the fishery production work in the first half of the year, the conference criticized the purely profit-seeking view of the relevant economic departments serving fishery production in their purchasing and supply work. The conference pointed out that this error has affected certain abnormal phenomena in the production, sales, and supply relationship in fishery production.

    The heads of the relevant economic departments who participated in the meeting made self-criticisms in their speeches and stated that they would quickly correct past mistakes and put forward preliminary plans to improve the production, sales, and supply relationship. The aquatic products department is also preparing to extract a portion of its profits to support fishery cooperatives in developing production and improving welfare undertakings.

    Currently, fishermen in Fujian Province who have joined fishery cooperatives account for 96.15% of the total number of fishing households. After studying the issue of further consolidating fishery cooperatives, the conference put forward improvement plans for the business management, labor organization, and income distribution of fishery cooperatives.

Cannot Ignore the Interests of Fishermen

    The Yangtze River Daily published an editorial on the 25th entitled "Support the Demands of Fishermen," criticizing the bureaucratic style of the three freshwater fish farms in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, which one-sidedly emphasized national interests and ignored the suffering of fishermen and market needs. The editorial wrote that there are dozens of large and small lakes in the suburbs of Wuhan, covering an area of more than 300,000 mu, which is a nationally renowned freshwater fish farming area. Why has fresh fish disappeared from the market for a long time recently? From the letters of the fishermen, we know that it is neither that there are no fish in the lakes, nor that the fishermen are unwilling to fish, but that after the farms managed the large and small lakes, they put up notices of "lake bans" everywhere in order to allow the fish to continue to grow, so as to complete their "task calculated by output." As a result, citizens cannot eat large or small fish; fishermen's livelihoods have also been blocked because they cannot engage in fishery production. Members of the fishery cooperative changed from three meals a day to two meals, and some members can only eat fine bran. Many fishermen have to abandon their fishing nets and become peddlers. Some fishermen could not bear it and "stole" fish, and were fined by the farm cadres when they were caught. The cadres only know how to catch fishermen who "steal" fish, but never study why the fishermen "steal" fish.

    The editorial pointed out that there are many ways for farms to complete national tasks. If the 300,000 mu of freshwater lakes are well managed, calculating an average annual output of 400 jin per mu, it would exceed ten times the annual task of the three farms. If they can adopt the many valuable opinions put forward by the fishermen, they will manage better.

    The editorial concluded that the farms must reverse the wrong practice of abandoning fishermen and operating independently and should act in accordance with the principle of meeting market supply and benefiting both the country and the fishermen.

    发展渔业生产满足市场需要
    广东沿海各渔业社  开展技术改革运动
    在过去的半年里，广东省沿海各渔业生产合作社开展技术改革运动，推广有关改良网具、工具和操作方法的十多种先进技术和先进经验。
    湛江专区的全部大拖风渔船和汕头、惠阳专区、海南行政区的绝大多数渔船，都装上天井网。滤泥网、漏斗网和船头滑车等，也已在大多数渔船上使用。在今年春季和夏季渔汛中，改装天井网的渔船一般增产15％以上，海南岛有些渔船使用天井网比以前增产30％。在拖风渔船上装了船头滑车以后，不但可以节省两个劳动力，而且还提高了工作效率。渔民们反映：技术改革真解决问题！
    广东省水产厅今年在沿海各主要县份和渔港建立了技术指导站，帮助渔民推广先进技术。各地渔区还通过参观、广播、举办实物展览和渔船大工训练班等方式。总结和推广了渔业生产的先进经验。
    修造船只迎接鱼汛
    在秋季鱼汛即将到来之前，广东沿海各地渔业社已经建造和修理了大批新渔船和旧渔船。据广东省水产厅最近不完全统计，目前已经造好的新船有七百六十艘左右，其中有二百七十多艘是载重量在四百担到一千担的大、中等渔船，比去年全年的造船数量增加了一倍多。
    今年各地修船的规模也比往年大，汕头、湛江等专区的绝大多数渔船都曾加以整修，数量都在千艘以上，在秋季鱼汛来得较早的汕尾渔场已经有许多新旧渔船投入生产。
    今年广东沿海的渔民已有93％以上加入了合作社。为了扶助渔民发展生产，今年国家先后拨下二千四百多万元渔业贷款，比去年增加了将近一倍。此外，沿海各地的有关部门也及早调拨木材等材料，造船、修船，预计今年全省建造的新船将在一千四百艘以上。
    福建召开沿海工作会议
     研究渔业生产问题
    中共福建省委员会在8日到19日召开了沿海地区工作会议，着重研究了发展渔业生产问题。
    今年春汛时期，福建地区大风频繁，影响渔民出海，因而上半年捕鱼量略有减少，当前渔民们在生产和生活上还有不少困难。会议在检查上半年渔业生产工作中，批评了为渔业生产服务的有关经济部门在收购和供应工作中存在的单纯盈利观点。会议指出，这个错误已经影响了渔业生产中的产、销、供关系的某些失常现象。
    参加会议的有关经济部门的负责人，在发言中作了自我检讨，并且表示要迅速纠正以往错误，提出了改进产、销、供关系的初步方案。水产部门还准备从利润中抽出一部分钱来，支援渔业社发展生产和改善福利事业。
    目前福建省参加渔业社的渔户，已经占总渔户96.15％。会议在研究进一步巩固渔业社的问题以后，对渔业社的经营管理、劳动组织和收益分配等提出了改进方案。
  不能漠视渔民利益
    长江日报在25日发表“支持渔民的要求”的社论，批评湖北省、武汉市等三个淡水鱼养殖场片面强调国家利益，漠视渔民疾苦和市场需要的官僚主义作风。社论写道，武汉市郊区有大小湖泊几十个，面积三十多万亩，是全国闻名的淡水鱼养殖区，为什么最近很长时期市场上鲜鱼绝迹了呢？从渔民的来信中才知道：既不是湖里无鱼，更不是渔民不愿捕鱼，而是养殖场在管理大小湖泊以后，为了使鱼继续成长，到处树起“禁湖”的告示，以便为它们完成“以产量计算的任务”。这样一来，市民们大鱼小鱼都吃不到了；渔民由于不能进行渔业生产，生活来源也被堵塞了。渔业社的社员们改每日三餐为两餐，有的社员甚至只能吃细糠，很多渔民不得不抛开渔网去当小贩，有的渔民忍耐不了，“偷”捕了鱼，被养殖场干部捉到后罚了款。干部们只知道捉“偷”捕鱼的渔民，却从没有研究渔民们为什么要“偷”捕鱼。
    社论指出，养殖场完成国家任务的途径是很多的。如果把三十万亩面积的淡水湖很好管理起来，以平均每亩年产四百斤计算，就可以超过三个养殖场全年任务的十倍以上。如果它们能够采纳渔民们提出的很多宝贵的意见，会经营得更好。
    社论最后说，养殖场必须扭转抛开渔民、独家经营的错误作法，应当按照满足市场供应，既利国家又利渔民的原则办事。
