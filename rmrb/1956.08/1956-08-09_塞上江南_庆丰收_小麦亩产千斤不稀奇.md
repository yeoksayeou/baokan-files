    "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall" Celebrates Bumper Harvest
    Wheat Yields of 1,000 Jin Per Mu Are Not Uncommon
    (Reported by this newspaper) On the Yellow River Plain in northern Gansu Province, known as "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall," a wheat harvest has been achieved that has not been seen in recent years. The average yield per unit area of wheat from the more than 670 agricultural production cooperatives on the plain reached 405 jin. This is an increase of 30% to 40% compared to the bumper year of 1955, with a total output increase of more than 165 million jin. At the same time, many large-area, high-yield units have emerged. More than 270 agricultural cooperatives in Wuzhong, Lingwu and other counties and cities of the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture (excluding a small mountainous area of Lingwu) achieved an average yield of 500 jin per mu; the more than 20,000 mu of wheat in 26 agricultural cooperatives in Yongning County achieved a yield of 600 to 700 jin per mu.

    Good news of yields of 1,000 jin per mu are also constantly coming from various agricultural cooperatives: more than half of the 16 agricultural cooperatives in Wuzhong City have seen "1,000-jin wheat"; the wheat yield per mu in the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangzheng Township, Yongning County, reached a maximum of 1,200 jin; the Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative created 30 mu of "1,000-jin wheat" on saline-alkali land; and the Xinlian Agricultural Cooperative at the foot of Helan Mountain, which has always been known as a drought-stricken area, achieved a yield of 1,100 jin per mu on 15 mu of wheat fields as a result of fighting against drought.

    With the bumper wheat harvest, 90% to 95% of the members of various agricultural cooperatives have increased their income. The grain distributed per labor day can generally be converted into 2.2 to 2.3 yuan, with the highest reaching 4 yuan. Liu Zhongxuan, a member of the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongwei County, earned 1,429 yuan in summer alone, more than four times his total income last year. Qiao Lianhe, a Beijing immigrant who has only been here for more than half a year, also received more than 3,300 jin of wheat, enough for his family of seven to eat for more than a year.

    “塞上江南”庆丰收
    小麦亩产千斤不稀奇
    本报讯　号称“塞上江南”的甘肃省北部的黄河平原上，获得了近年来所没有的小麦丰收。平原上的六百七十多个农业生产合作社的小麦单位面积产量，平均达到了四百零五斤。比丰收的1955年要增产三成到四成，总产量增加了一亿六千五百多万斤。同时，还出现了许多大面积高额丰产单位。吴忠回族自治州的吴忠，灵武等县、市（不包括灵武少部分山区）的二百七十多个农业社，每亩产量平均达到了五百斤；永宁县的二十六个农业社的两万多亩小麦，每亩产量达到六、七百斤。
    亩产千斤的喜讯也不断从各个农业社传出：吴忠市的十六个农业社，有半数以上出现了“千斤麦”；永宁县掌政乡星火农业社的小麦亩产量，最高达到了一千二百斤；宝丰农业社在盐碱化的土地上，创造了三十亩“千斤麦”；一向被人称为干旱地区的贺兰山脚下的新联农业社，和干旱作斗争的结果，有十五亩麦田每亩产一千一百斤。
    随着小麦的丰收，各个农业社有90％到95％的社员增加了收入。一般每个劳动日所分的粮食可折合两元二、三角钱，最高的达到了四元。中卫县沙滩农业社社员刘仲选，光夏季收入就达一千四百二十九元，比去年全年还多四倍多。到这里才有半年多时间的北京移民乔连河，也分到了三千三百多斤小麦，足够他全家七口人吃一年多。
