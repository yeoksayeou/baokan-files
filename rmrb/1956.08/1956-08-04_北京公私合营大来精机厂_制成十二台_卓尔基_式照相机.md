    Beijing Joint State-Private Da Lai Precision Machinery Factory
    Manufactures Twelve "Zorki" Cameras

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Beijing Joint State-Private Da Lai Precision Machinery Factory recently manufactured twelve small Soviet "Zorki" cameras with coupled rangefinders. These cameras have a maximum shutter speed of 1/500th of a second and a maximum lens aperture of f/3.5. Tests have shown that the rangefinder and shutter speeds are accurate, and the photos taken are clear.
    The "Zorki" camera is a small-batch trial product of this factory. Except for the optical glass lens, all other parts are manufactured by the factory itself. They will also trial-produce twin-lens reflex cameras in the third quarter, with plans to mass-produce both types of cameras starting next year.
    The Machinery Industry Company of the Beijing Third Local Industry Bureau has increased investment in the factory, expanded the factory buildings, and added technicians, workers, and machinery. In the small-batch trial production, it also organized cooperation between the factory and joint state-private factories such as Shiwen Instrument Factory and Xinguang Electroplating Factory. The Machinery Industry Company has now formulated plans for further expanding the factory's production. (Attached picture)

    北京公私合营大来精机厂
    制成十二台“卓尔基”式照相机
    新华社讯　北京公私合营大来精机厂最近制成十二台小型的有连动测距装置的苏联“卓尔基”式照相机。这些照相机的快门速度最快达五百分之一秒，镜头最大的口径是三点五，经过试验，测距和快门速度都准确，拍摄的照片清晰。
    “卓尔基”式照相机是这个工厂小批试制的产品，除了镜头的光学玻璃镜片以外，其他都是由这个工厂自己制造的。他们在第三季度内还要试制双镜头反光镜照相机，计划从明年起大批生产这两种照相机。
    北京市第三地方工业局机械工业公司在这个厂增加了投资，扩大了厂房，增添了技术工人和机器设备，在小批试制中还组织了世文仪器厂、新光电镀厂等公私合营工厂和这个厂协作。现在机械工业公司已经为这个厂制定了进一步扩大生产的计划。（附图片）
