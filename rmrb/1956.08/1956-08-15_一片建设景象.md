A Scene of Construction

    In a special district of Fujian Province:
    Seventeen local state-owned factories and mines in the Fuan Special District of northeastern Fujian are under intense design and construction. These factories and mines include oil mills, sugar mills, sulfur mines, small machine repair shops, small combined factories, and power plants.
    Northeastern Fujian is a famous camellia seed producing area in Fujian Province. In the past, indigenous oil pressing methods were used, which were labor-intensive, time-consuming, yielded little oil, and produced low-quality oil. The establishment of four oil mills in Fuan, Xiapu, and Fuding, each with a daily pressing capacity of 17.5 tons of camellia seeds, will initially change this backward situation. Currently, the plan is to press 1,000 tons of oil annually, and in the future, the equipment's potential can be exploited to press an additional 800 tons of camellia oil. The four new sugar mills in Fuan and Ningde, with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 190 tons, can save 25,000 man-days and 500 head of cattle during the 120-day crushing season compared to indigenous sugar mills. The abundant sulfur mines in Zhouning and Fuan can supply farmers with insecticides and fertilizers, as well as industrial raw materials, after they are officially put into production.

    The Shijiazhuang Starch Factory
    The exterior construction of the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory, a large-scale project that began construction in June of last year, has now been completed. A large part of the equipment installation has also been completed.
    The Shijiazhuang Starch Factory is a new type of chemical factory built with the full assistance of the Soviet Union. The process from raw material entering the factory to product production is almost entirely mechanized and automated. Even the workers in the main factory building use automatic elevators to go to and from work. Various devices have complete safety and protection measures. The workers' welfare facilities are also very good. Production workshops have cloakrooms, nursing rooms, and male and female bathrooms.
    This factory is expected to be officially put into production in the second quarter of next year, and will produce large quantities of glucose to improve people's health and starch for the food and textile industries every year.

    Building Power Stations for Ethnic Minorities
    A small-scale hydroelectric power station for both lighting and production is being built in the suburbs of Longsheng Autonomous County of various ethnic groups in Guangxi Province. When this hydropower station is completed before National Day this year, it will be able to install 2,000 electric lights. During the day, electricity can be used to drive rice milling machines and sawmills for production. Currently, there are 300 people of Zhuang, Dong, Yao, Miao and other ethnic groups working on the construction site every day to divert water. (Xinhua News Agency)
    
    For Increased Vegetable Oil Production
    The first small-scale solvent extraction vegetable oil factory built in Luohe City, Henan Province, is designed according to advanced Soviet experience, and its equipment is highly automated. The factory's production method uses chemical solvent benzene extraction, and the oil extraction rate can reach 97% of the soybean oil content. Compared with the most effective mechanical pressing method, the oil extraction rate can be increased by 16%, labor productivity will be increased by nearly one time, and the cost will be reduced by about 20%. The soybean meal after extraction also has great economic value and can be used as industrial raw materials for plastics, artificial wool, and adhesives. This factory can be put into production in the first quarter of next year. After it is put into production, it can process more than 80,000 catties of soybeans per day, and produce more than 5.26 million catties of oil annually. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    A Batch of New Oil Pressing Enterprises
    Sichuan Province is building eleven machine oil pressing factories. These factories are located in Qianjiang, Pengxi, Anxian, Yibin and other counties in the tung oil, cotton, rapeseed and peanut producing areas. Among them, seven factories can press 10 tons of raw materials per day, and the other four factories can press 5 tons. After all these factories are put into production, they can produce more than 24.36 million catties of various oils and fats every year. (Xinhua News Agency)
    
    Hangzhou Will Have a Clock and Watch Industry
    A Hangzhou Clock and Watch Manufacturing Factory with an annual output of one million clocks has selected a site in the quiet and clean scenic area of ​​Yuquan in Hangzhou and is expected to start construction in the fourth quarter of this year. Jinsheng Clock and Watch Manufacturing Factory and Hengdeli Clock and Watch Manufacturing Factory, famous for manufacturing Diamond brand alarm clocks and electric clocks, have also decided to move to Hangzhou and merge into the Hangzhou Clock and Watch Manufacturing Factory. This factory is expected to start producing clocks and watches in the first half of next year. (Gao Juexiao)
    
    Finding a Way Out for Wild Fruits
    A large-scale fruit wine factory is under construction in Yakshi, a city in the Greater Khingan Range forest area of ​​the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and can be completed and put into production at the end of August.
    The Greater Khingan Range forest area is rich in wild fruits such as "Dushi" and "Yageda", with an annual output of more than one million catties. In the past, they were treated as waste because they were not utilized. This year, brewing and other departments collected these fruits for testing and proved that they can be used to make various delicious fruit wines. The winery is now mobilizing people of all ethnic groups to collect wild fruits such as "Dushi" and is starting to purchase them. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一片建设景象
    福建省的一个专区里
    闽东北福安专区有十七个地方国营厂矿正在紧张地进行设计和施工。这些厂矿包括榨油厂、糖厂、硫磺矿、小型机器修配厂、小型联合工厂和电厂等。
    闽东北是福建省著名的油茶籽产地，过去土榨加工油茶，费工费时，出油少，质量低。福安、霞浦、福鼎建立四个日榨十七吨半茶籽的油厂后，这种落后状况就能初步改变；目前计划每年榨油一千吨，将来发挥设备潜力，还可增榨八百吨茶油。福安、宁德新建的四个糖厂，日榨甘蔗一百九十吨，在一百二十天榨期中，比土糖坊可节省二万五千个人工和五百头牛力。藏量丰富的周宁、福安硫磺矿正式生产后，可以供应农民做杀虫药剂和肥料，也可作工业原料。　（福建日报）
    石家庄的淀粉厂
    去年六月动工兴建的规模巨大的石家庄淀粉厂厂房外型建筑工程，现在已经全部完工；设备安装也完成了一大半。
    石家庄淀粉厂是苏联全面帮助我国建设的一座新型的化学工厂。这个厂从原料进厂到产品生产过程，几乎全部是机械化自动化的，连在主厂房生产的工人，上下班都乘自动电梯。在各种设备上，都有完善的安全、保护装置。工人的福利设备也很好。生产车间有更衣室、哺乳室、男女洗澡间等建筑。
    这个工厂预计在明年第二季度正式投入生产，每年将大量生产增进人民身体健康的葡萄糖和食品工业、纺织工业用的淀粉。

    给少数民族修电站
    广西省龙胜各族自治县城郊，正在兴建一座供照明、生产两用的小型水力发电站。这座水电站在今年国庆节前建成的时候，能够安装两千盏电灯；白天可以用电力带动碾米机和锯木机进行生产。现在，水电站的工地上每天都有三百多僮、侗、瑶、苗等民族人民在做开渠引水工作。　　　（新华社）
    为了增产植物油
    河南省漯河市兴建的第一座小型溶剂浸出植物油厂，是根据苏联先进经验设计的，它的设备自动化程度较高。工厂的生产方法，是利用化学溶剂苯浸出法进行的，出油率能达到大豆含油量的97％；同最有效的机械压榨法比较，出油率能提高16％，劳动生产率提高将近一倍，成本降低20％左右。浸出后的豆粕，经济价值也很大，能做塑胶、人造羊毛、胶合剂等工业原料。这个厂到明年第一季度就可以投入生产。投入生产以后，每日能整理大豆八万多斤，全年可以产油五百二十六万斤以上。（据新华社讯）
    一批新榨油企业
    四川省正在兴建十一座机器榨油厂。这些工厂分别设在桐油、棉花、菜籽和花生产区的黔江、蓬溪、安县、宜宾等县。其中，有七座工厂每日能榨原料十吨，另四座厂能榨五吨。这些厂全部投入生产后，每年可以生产各种油脂二千四百三十六万多斤。　　　　　（新华社）
    杭州将有钟表工业
    一个年产一百万只钟的杭州钟表制造厂，已经在杭州玉泉幽静清洁的风景区选定厂址，预计在今年第四季度就可动工兴建了。制造钻石牌闹钟和电钟闻名的金声钟表制造厂、亨得利钟表制造厂，也决定迁往杭州，并入杭州钟表制造厂。这个厂预计在明年上半年开始生产钟表。　　　　　　　　　（高抉小）
    给野果找出路
    一座规模较大的色酒厂正在内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区城市牙克石动工兴建，八月底可以完工投入生产。
    大兴安岭林区盛产“杜士”“牙格达”等野生果子，每年产量达一百多万斤，过去因为没有利用都当成了废物。今年，酿酒等部门搜集这些果子化验，证明可以用以制出各种味美的色酒。酿酒厂现在正动员各族人民采集“杜士”等野生果物，并且开始收购。　（新华社）
