India's economic relations with capitalist countries are quite close. According to statistics from the Reserve Bank of India, at the end of 1953, the face value of foreign capital in India was 4.21 billion rupees (market value of 5.26 billion rupees), of which British capital was 3.47 billion rupees, accounting for about 82%. Many major industries and banks are operated by foreign merchants. In addition, India's foreign trade is also mainly with capitalist countries, with trade between Britain and the United States accounting for about 50% of India's total imports and exports, while socialist countries account for a very small proportion.

However, due to the Indian government's policy of friendly cooperation with all countries in the world, India's economic and trade relations with socialist countries have also greatly developed in recent years.

In terms of economic and technical cooperation, the Soviet Union is helping India build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel. Three hundred Soviet experts have already come to work in India, and India has also sent three hundred technicians to study in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is helping India establish an advanced industrial technology institute free of charge, which can train one thousand technical cadres every year, and is sending experts to India to explore oil resources and supply oil drilling equipment. At the same time, it is sending diamond experts to help India mine diamond mines on a large scale, and provide technical data and machinery and equipment. The Soviet Union sent India seventy tractors, sixty combine harvesters and other agricultural machinery, which can be used to open mechanized farms of about 30,000 acres. In addition, the Soviet Union has also suggested helping India build lead smelting plants, hydroelectric power plants, pharmaceutical factories, etc. Czechoslovakia is supplying India with 2,050 carriages, fifty locomotives, a cement plant, two sugar factories, two steam power plants, a diesel power plant, a forging and pressing factory and foundry, a machine tool factory, a camera factory and a glass factory. In addition, it is also in talks with India to help build an aluminum plant. Poland is supplying India with equipment for coal mines and railway vehicle factories, and suggests helping India explore mineral resources, especially coal and copper mines. The German Democratic Republic is helping India develop the film manufacturing and lignite industries, and has sent a technical delegation to India. This coal mine can produce 3.5 million tons of lignite annually. Romania is supplying India with oil drilling equipment and technicians. Hungary has suggested supplying India with machinery assembly plants. Yugoslavia will also give India technical assistance in dock construction and shipbuilding industries. Our country and India also exchange technical data and send experts to visit each other. Experts from our country visited paper mills in India, and experts from India visited water conservancy projects in our country. Recently, two Indian agricultural delegations came to our country to visit and inspect. Indian industrialists and businessmen have also requested our country to supply some complete sets of light industrial equipment.

In terms of foreign trade, India has signed trade agreements with almost all socialist countries, and the volume of trade has also increased greatly. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and India increased more than four times in 1955 compared with 1953; the trade volume between our country and India increased more than two times in 1955 compared with 1954. The trade volume between other socialist countries and India has also increased.

With the rapid development of trade between India and socialist countries, transportation has become an urgent problem to be solved. In April and May of this year, India signed shipping agreements with the Soviet Union and Poland respectively. These two agreements, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, stipulate that the Soviet and Indian parties shall each arrange six ocean-going vessels totaling 55,000 tons, and the Polish and Indian parties shall each arrange three vessels to regularly sail to Soviet-Indian and Polish-Indian ports, equally distribute cargo, stipulate reasonable freight rates, grant each other's ships the most favorable treatment and convenience, and send representatives to regularly consult on relevant issues.

Strengthening economic and trade relations between India and socialist countries is in line with India's national interests and the principle of international cooperation.

The Indian government requires the development of national industries, especially heavy industry, but capitalist countries are unwilling to see India's this requirement realized. They try their best to maintain the one-sidedness of the Indian economy, attempting to make it forever dependent on capitalist countries. For example, the delegation of the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development," which serves American capitalists, opposed India establishing its own steel plant. The American "Ford Motor Company" and "General Motors Company" established a car assembly plant in India that can only produce car bodies and a few ordinary parts, while engines and important parts must be imported from the United States. In 1952, the Indian government suggested that these two companies gradually expand the factory into a car manufacturing plant, but they not only did not accept this suggestion, but closed the original factory and even transported away the original factory equipment.

Contrary to capitalist countries, socialist countries believe that India can only overcome the one-sidedness of its economy in order to eliminate its economic backwardness. To do this, it is necessary to develop national industries, especially heavy industry. When the Indian government develops industry, they are willing to do their best to assist.

Although capitalist countries also give India some economic or technical "assistance", this "assistance" is to facilitate the expansion of its influence. Therefore, political conditions are often attached when giving "assistance." The "Indo-US Technical Cooperation Agreement" stipulates that India should provide rupees equal to the amount of "assistance" as a "counterpart fund," and the use of this fund shall be determined and supervised by the United States. This agreement also stipulates that the "experts" sent by the United States to India enjoy the privileges of diplomatic personnel, and the Indian government should give them all kinds of conveniences to "investigate and survey" its economy and resources. The United States also uses "assistance" as a tool to exert pressure. Many influential American politicians have demanded that "assistance" to India be stopped. For example, Senator Knowland said: "The United States has no reason to continue to assist countries that do not help build alliances (referring to American military blocs)."

Contrary to capitalist countries, socialist countries establish broad economic cooperation with India on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for sovereignty. Socialist countries never attach any political conditions when providing India with economic or technical assistance.

When capitalist countries give India "assistance" or invest in India, they not only want to obtain privileges, but also want to obtain generous profits. For example, in 1951, the American Texaco Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company, and British Burma Shell Oil Company jointly built three oil refineries in India, stipulating that crude oil imports are tax-free, oil refinery equipment imports are taxed at the lowest rate, while the selling price of petroleum products is not lower than the market price of petroleum products imported by India. Therefore, the profits of these three oil refineries are staggering. According to a recent report published by Mobil Oil Company, its oil refinery in Mumbai has made profits equivalent to 60% of the investment amount in the past year alone. However, according to the opinions of Indian government experts, the profit actually reached 200%.

Contrary to capitalist countries, socialist countries' assistance to India is not for the pursuit of profit, and the interest on loans is also very low. The following example shows the different attitudes taken by capitalist countries and socialist countries when assisting India. When helping India build a steel plant, the annual interest rate of the loan given to India by West Germany was 5.5%-6%, while the annual interest rate of the loan given to India by the Soviet Union was only 2.5%. After the steel plant is built, West Germany will occupy a large part of the shares and have great management rights in the plant, while the Soviet Union does not require to own shares or participate in the management of the plant. The Indo-Soviet agreement also stipulates that the strength of Indian experts and workers and domestic materials should be used as much as possible when constructing the steel plant. This increases orders for Indian enterprises, thus promoting the increase of employment. This measure of the Soviet Union has aroused a profound reaction among the Indian government and people. They believe that the Indo-Soviet agreement will accelerate India's industrialization. Indian Production Minister Reddy pointed out that the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union for the construction of this factory enable India to accept complete technical experience and may reduce dependence on foreign assistance in the future.

Capitalist countries and India conduct trade in an unequal exchange manner. The industrial products they supply to India are mostly consumer goods, which is only beneficial to capitalist countries, and is often unfavorable to India's efforts to get rid of its economic backwardness.

Contrary to capitalist countries, socialist countries not only trade with India at fair and reasonable prices, but also supply India with various machines, railway vehicles and other means of production and complete sets of equipment. When Bulganin and Khrushchev visited India, an agreement was reached that the Soviet Union would supply India with one million tons of steel from 1956 to 1958. Some socialist countries and India trade also stipulate that the Indian rupee should be used as a means of payment. This can eliminate the payment difficulties caused by India's lack of foreign exchange.

Now India is implementing the second five-year plan focusing on the development of heavy industry. It needs more economic and technical assistance, and also needs to import more means of production and complete sets of equipment. We believe that the economic and trade relations between India and socialist countries will surely be further developed.

    印度同社会主义国家经济关系和贸易关系的发展
    王兆勋
    印度和资本主义国家的经济关系是相当密切的。据印度储备银行的统计，截至1953年底，在印度的外国资本的票面价值是42.1亿卢比（折合市场价值是52.6亿卢比），其中英国资本是34.7亿卢比，约占82％。许多主要工业和银行都由外商经营。此外，印度的对外贸易也以资本主义国家为主要对象，英美两国对印度的贸易额占印度进出口总额的50％左右，而社会主义国家只占非常小的比重。
    但是由于印度政府执行同世界各国友好合作的政策，近些年来印度同社会主义国家的经济关系和贸易关系也有了很大的发展。
    在经济和技术合作方面，苏联帮助印度建立一个年产130万吨钢材的炼钢厂。三百个苏联专家已经到印度工作，印度也派遣三百个技术人员到苏联学习。苏联无偿地帮助印度建立一个高级工业技术学院，每年可以训练一千个技术干部，并派遣专家到印度勘查石油资源，供应石油钻探设备。同时派遣金钢钻专家帮助印度大规模开采金钢钻矿，并提供技术资料和机器设备。苏联送给印度七十辆拖拉机，六十辆收割机和其他农业机械，这些机械可以用来开办三万英亩左右的机械化农场。此外，苏联还建议帮助印度建立炼铅厂、水电厂、制药厂等。捷克斯洛伐克供应印度2，050个车厢，五十个火车头，一个水泥厂，两个制糖厂，两个蒸气发电厂，一个柴油发电厂，一个锻压工厂和翻砂厂，一个工作母机厂，一个照相机厂和一个玻璃厂。此外，还正在和印度接洽帮助建立一个炼铝厂。波兰供应印度煤矿和铁路车辆厂的设备，并建议帮助印度勘查矿源，特别是煤矿和铜矿。德意志民主共和国帮助印度发展电影制造业和褐煤工业，并派遣技术代表团到印度。这个煤矿每年可以生产三百五十万吨褐煤。罗马尼亚供应印度石油钻探设备和技术人员。匈牙利建议供应印度机器装配厂。南斯拉夫在码头建筑和造船工业方面也将给印度技术援助。我国和印度也互相交换技术资料和互相派遣专家访问。我国的专家参观了印度的造纸厂，印度的专家参观了我国的水利工程，最近还有两批印度农业代表团来我国访问和考察。印度的工商业家也要求我国供应某些轻工业成套设备。
    在对外贸易方面，印度已经差不多和所有社会主义国家签订了贸易协定，贸易额也有很大的增加。苏联和印度的贸易额，1955年比1953年增加了四倍多；我国和印度的贸易额，1955年比1954年增加了两倍多。其他社会主义国家和印度的贸易额也都有增加。
    随着印度同社会主义国家贸易的迅速发展，运输成为迫切需要解决的问题。今年四、五月间印度先后同苏联、波兰签订了航运协定。这两个协定根据平等互利的原则，规定苏印双方各安排共五万五千吨的海洋航轮六艘，波、印双方各安排三艘，定期航行苏印、波印口岸，平均分配货载，规定合理运费，互相给予对方船只以最优惠待遇和方便，互派代表定期协商有关问题。
    印度同社会主义国家加强经济关系和贸易关系，是符合印度民族利益的，也是符合国际合作的原则的。
    印度政府要求发展民族工业，特别是重工业，但是资本主义国家不愿意看到印度的这种要求得到实现，它们竭力保持印度经济的片面性，企图使它永远依赖资本主义国家。例如，为美国资本家服务的“国际复兴开发银行”的代表团就曾反对印度建立自己的炼钢厂。美国“福特汽车公司”和“通用汽车公司”在印度建立了一个只能生产车身和少数普通零件的汽车装配厂，而发动机和重要机件都须从美国输入。1952年，印度政府曾建议这两个公司逐渐把工厂扩建为汽车制造厂，结果它们不但不接受这个建议，反而关闭了原来的工厂，甚至还运走了原有的工厂设备。
    和资本主义国家相反，社会主义国家认为印度只有克服经济的片面性，才能够消灭它的经济的落后性。为了做到这一点，必须发展民族工业，特别是重工业。当印度政府发展工业的时候，它们愿意尽力予以协助。
    资本主义国家虽然也给予印度一些经济或技术“援助”，但是这种“援助”是为了便于扩张它的势力。因此，在给予“援助”的时候，常常附有政治的条件。“印美技术合作协定”规定，印度应提供和“援助”金额相等的卢比作为“对等基金”，由美国来决定和监督这项基金的用途。这个协定还规定美国派往印度的“专家”享有外交人员的特权，印度政府要给他们“考察和调查”它的经济和资源的种种便利。美国还利用“援助”作为施加压力的工具。许多有势力的美国政客们都曾要求停止对印度的“援助”。例如，参议员诺兰说：“美国没有理由一定要继续援助对建立同盟（指美国军事集团）没有帮助的国家。”
    和资本主义国家相反，社会主义国家是在平等互利、互相尊重主权的基础上和印度建立广泛的经济合作。社会主义国家给予印度经济或技术援助的时候，绝不附带任何政治条件。
    资本主义国家给予印度“援助”或向印度投资的时候，不仅要取得特权，而且要获得优厚的利润。例如，1951年美国德士古石油公司、美孚石油公司、英国缅甸壳牌石油公司和印度合建三个炼油厂，规定原油进口免税，炼油厂设备进口按最低税率纳税，而石油产品的出售价格却不低于印度进口的石油产品的市价。因此，这三个炼油厂的利润是惊人的。据美孚石油公司最近发表的报告，它在孟买的炼油厂仅仅在过去一年中，就获得了相当于投资额60％的利润。但据印度政府专家的意见，实际上，利润达到了200％。
    和资本主义国家相反，社会主义国家对印度的援助不是为了追求利润，贷款的利息也是很低的。下面的例子可以看出资本主义国家和社会主义国家对印度援助时所采取不同的态度。在帮助印度建立炼钢厂时，西德给印度的贷款年息是5.5％—6％，而苏联给印度贷款年息只2.5％。炼钢厂建成后，西德将占有很大一部分股份，并且在该厂中拥有很大的管理权，而苏联则不要求拥有股份，也不要求参加工厂的管理。印苏协定还规定在建筑炼钢厂时要尽量使用印度专家和工人的力量以及印度本国的材料。这样给予印度企业增加了订货，因而将促进就业的增加。苏联这一措施在印度政府和人民中间引起了深刻的反应。他们认为印苏协定将加速印度的工业化。印度生产部长雷迪曾经指出，苏联对建设这座工厂所提出的条件，使印度能够接受完整的技术经验，并且将来可能减少对于外国援助的依赖。
    资本主义国家和印度进行贸易是采取不等价交换的方式，它们供应印度的工业品绝大部分是消费品，这仅仅对资本主义国家是有利的，而对印度摆脱它的经济的落后性常常是不利的。
    和资本主义国家相反，社会主义国家不仅按照公平合理的价格和印度进行贸易，而且供应印度的是各种机器、铁路车辆等生产物资和成套设备。布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问印度时曾达成协议，自1956年到1958年苏联供应印度一百万吨钢材。社会主义国家和印度进行贸易，有的还规定用印度卢比作为支付手段。这样可以免除印度因为缺少外汇而造成的支付困难。
    现在印度正在实行以发展重工业为重点的第二个五年计划，它需要更多的经济和技术的援助，也需要进口更多的生产物资和成套设备。我们相信，印度和社会主义国家的经济关系和贸易关系一定会得到进一步的发展。
