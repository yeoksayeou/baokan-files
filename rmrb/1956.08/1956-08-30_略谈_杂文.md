A Brief Discussion on "Essays"
    He Yongming
    I read Ding San's "A Brief Discussion on Specifications" essay in the People's Daily, and I'd also like to talk about essays.
    Ding San's article essentially says that the author walked into a "cooperative restaurant" in a certain county town in Zhejiang and wanted to eat dishes like stir-fried three delicacies. The strange restaurant had fixed "specifications" for its three delicacies. The author didn't like that kind of three delicacies and wanted to order another dish with a different recipe, but was told it wasn't allowed because it was the restaurant's "specification"! This led the author to think about writing, believing that articles are not entirely without specifications, but absolutely do not need the rigid specifications of the Eight-legged essay. Finally, the author expressed the following sentiment:
    "True specifications and styles should be creative and vibrant living things, and their greatest enemy is dead 'specifications.' As soon as one encounters dead 'specifications,' all living things perish. It's the same for cooking, even more so for writing, and isn't it the same for handling affairs and doing work!"
    However, there is another aspect to the actual situation, which is that there are too few genuinely hard things and things with truly good specifications. For example, when it comes to writing essays, aren't some people currently working hard to learn from Lu Xun's essays? Lu Xun's essays often include citations, metaphors, and associations that seem unrelated to the article's theme, but when you look at the whole text, these citations, metaphors, and associations are logically clear, closely related to each other, and reveal a brilliant argument, a profound insight. Such citations, metaphors, and associations require broad knowledge and the ability to understand the internal relationships of things. Therefore, a short article is worth reading again and again, giving people wisdom and strength. This is a hard thing that others cannot refute or destroy, a truly good specification. But some people do not learn Lu Xun's essays in this way, do not learn Lu Xun's ability to observe things, but only focus on those citations, metaphors, and associations, and think that these things are the "specifications" of essays; as for the article's argument, they forget it after reading it, or can infer it without finishing it. At first glance, you can tell that he is "making an article," which is very superficial. This first proves that these people themselves originally had no "specifications," so they can naturally adapt to any "specifications." How can such things not "perish"? Because his own statement is inherently untenable, his words are inaccurate, and his argument is based on falsehood, how can it withstand being "touched"?
    To break the rigid specifications of the Eight-legged essay, we need truly good specifications, truly hard things. There is a Chinese saying, "True gold fears no fire," and it's the same for being a person and doing things, "especially for writing articles."

### 略谈“杂文”

    略谈“杂文”
    何用铭
    在人民日报上读到丁三的“略谈规格”的杂文，也来谈谈杂文。
    丁三的文章大意是说，作者在浙江某县城走进一家“合作饭店”，要吃炒三鲜之类的菜，这个古怪的店子的三鲜的规格是死的，作者不喜欢那样的三鲜，要另炒一盆，说是不行，这是店子的“规格”！于是使作者联想到写文章，认为文章也不是完全没有规格的，但绝对不需要八股式的规格。末了，作者就发表了这样的感慨：
    “真正的规格和风格应该是有创造性和生命力的活东西，它的大敌就是死的‘规格’。一碰到死‘规格’，一切活东西便呜呼哀哉了。做菜如此，写文章尤其如此，办事做工作又何尝不是如此！”
    但是实际生活中也有另一方面的情况，就是真正的硬东西和真正有好规格的东西太少了。譬如写杂文吧，目下不是有些人很在努力学鲁迅的杂文么？鲁迅的杂文，其中常常有引证，有比喻，有看去似乎与文章主题无关的联想，但综览全文，这些引证、比喻和联想却逻辑分明，彼此紧密相关，揭示一个精辟的论点，一个深刻的见解。这样的引证、比喻和联想需要有渊博的知识和洞悉事物内在关系的能力，因此，一篇短文，累读不厌，给人以智慧和力量。这是别人驳不倒、打不烂的硬东西，真正的好规格。但有些人却不是这样去学鲁迅的杂文，去学鲁迅观察事物的本领，而只看中那些引证、比喻和联想，而且以为这些东西就是杂文的“规格”；至于文章的论点呢，看了也就忘了，或者没有看完就可以推想到。一眼看去，就知道他在“做文章”，浅得很。这就首先证明这些人自己本来没有什么“规格”，自然可以去适应任何“规格”的。像这样的东西，怎么不容易“呜呼哀哉”呢？因为他自己的陈述本来就站不住脚，话又不准，立论就虚，怎么经得起“碰”呢？
    要打破八股式的文章规格，需要真正的好规格，真正的硬东西。中国有句俗话说，真金不怕火炼，做人做事如此，“写文章尤其如此”。
