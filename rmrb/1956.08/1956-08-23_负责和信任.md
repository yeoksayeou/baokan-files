    Responsibility and Trust
    Guiding Principles
    There is a type of person who is both "conscientious" and "responsible" in their work. Their principles are as follows:
    If there is no notification to do something, even if it is a good thing, don't do it, otherwise you will be held responsible if something goes wrong.
    Do not carry out instructions given only orally or by phone, there must be written evidence, otherwise if problems arise, the person who gave the instructions may deny it and there will be no proof, and you will be held responsible.
    If the superior instructs two points, do not add a third point based on the actual situation, otherwise if something goes wrong, you cannot bear the responsibility. Zhou Shuwen
    Appoint but Distrust
    A company in Wuzhou City issued a special two-part letter of introduction to comrades going on business trips. The first part is for introduction to the destination, and the second part is a "return slip" to be signed by the other party, to prove that the cadre actually arrived at the unit. The comrade on the business trip must return with this return slip to close the case.
    Having sent people to represent the unit on official business, yet not trusting that they actually went. If you can't even trust whether they went, how can you trust them to truly represent the unit in handling affairs? Gui Mingchong

    负责和信任
    办事准则
    有这么一种人：办事既“认真”又“负责”。准则如下：
    没有通知要做的事，虽然是好事也不要去做，否则错了要负责任。
    仅有口头、电话通知的事不要执行，一定要有明文为据，否则出了问题，指示人翻案无据可查，自己就要负责。
    上级指示了两点，且不要根据实际情况补充为三点，否则出了错，自己担当不起。　周书文
    任而不信
    梧州市某公司发给出差工作同志一种特殊的两联介绍信，第一联是介绍前去的，第二联是由彼方签证的“回头单”，以便证明这个干部确实到达了该单位，出差同志必须凭这张回头单回去销差。
    既派出人去代表本单位公干，却又不相信他们真正前去。连他是否前去都信不过，又怎能相信他真正代表本单位办事呢？　桂鸣虫
