Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Tokyo News: The Japanese Socialist Party pointed out today that US Secretary of State Dulles' statement yesterday, attempting to seize the Ryukyu Islands, "clearly demonstrates the ambition of US imperialism and is also an attempt to hinder the normalization of Japanese-Soviet relations."

Dulles said at a press conference in Washington yesterday that he had asked Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu in London to pay attention to Article 26 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, namely: if another government obtains from Japan more favorable treaty conditions than those provided by the San Francisco Peace Treaty, then the signatories of the San Francisco Peace Treaty can demand the same benefits.

The Associated Press said that Dulles also explicitly stated that he did so to notify Japan that if it recognizes the Soviet Union's "control" of the Kuril Islands when it signs a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, then the United States may demand to obtain the Ryukyu Islands, including the military base on Okinawa.

The International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting after learning of Dulles's statement. After the meeting, Tadao Sata, the director of the International Bureau, issued a statement saying that the Socialist Party cannot agree with Dulles's statement. He said that the validity period of Article 26 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty is three years and has now expired. Furthermore, the treaty's reference to granting signatory countries the same benefits should only be interpreted as limited to various economic interests.

Dulles's statement also shocked some people in the Japanese government and the ruling party. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the US interpretation is unacceptable. This may be a kind of US restraint or warning to Japan. The Japanese Foreign Ministry's interpretation of Article 26 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty is that this clause has lost its binding force after three years, and that the provision for granting equal benefits only applies to monetary matters and not to territorial issues. The Foreign Ministry also pointed out that Okinawa cannot be arbitrarily recognized by Japan and the United States as being occupied by the United States.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ichiro Kono believes that Dulles's statement is "the most unnecessary and superfluous, because it is a warning on an issue that is purely between two independent countries."

    日政界斥杜勒斯阻碍日苏媾和
    社会党揭露美国企图霸占琉球野心
    外务省也不满美国对日本进行威胁
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯昨天发表的企图霸占琉球群岛的谈话，“明显地表现了美帝国主义的野心，同时也是企图妨碍日苏邦交正常化的表现”。
    杜勒斯昨天在华盛顿的记者招待会上说，他在伦敦时曾经要日本外务相重光葵注意旧金山和约中的第二十六条，即：如果另一国政府从日本获得了比旧金山和约所提供的更优惠的和约条件的话，那么旧金山和约的缔约国可以要求同样的利益。
    美联社说，杜勒斯还明确表示，他这样做为的是通知日本：如果它同苏联签订和约时承认苏联可以“控制”千岛群岛的话，那末美国可能要求取得包括冲绳岛军事基地在内的琉球群岛。
    日本社会党国际局在知道杜勒斯的这个谈话以后举行了会议。会后，国际局长佐多忠隆发表谈话声明，社会党不能同意杜勒斯的说法。他说，旧金山和约的第二十六条的有效期限是三年，现在已经届满。并且条约指的给予缔约国以同样利益只应该解释为限于各种经济利益方面。
    杜勒斯的谈话也引起了日本政府和执政党内一部分人的震惊。据共同社报道，日本外务省认为，美国的解释是难以接受的。这可能是美国透露出的一种对日本的牵制或者警告的意思。日本外务省对旧金山和约第二十六条的解释是：这个条款已经经过三年，失去了约束力，并且这项规定给予同等利益的条款只是以处理金钱为对象，不适用于领土问题。外务省并且指出，冲绳岛并不能任意由日美两国承认它为美国所占有。
    农林相河野一郎认为，杜勒斯的谈话是“最没有必要而且是多余的，因为它在纯粹是两个独立国家之间的问题上进行警告。”
