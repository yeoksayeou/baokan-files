A Football Team's "Leader"
    Li Lijin

    Some time ago, Deputy Director Cui of the People's Bank of China's Gan'nan Office heard news: the Gan'nan Office football team had been chosen to represent the Jiangxi Provincial Bank system in the national bank system football tryouts to be held in Qingdao.

    Deputy Director Cui was very happy to hear this news and began feverish activity. Deputy Director Cui wasn't happy because the office football team was fortunate enough to participate in the national tryouts; rather, it was because he himself could find a way to use the team's trip to Qingdao to "return to his hometown in glory."

    It seemed that Deputy Director Cui, thinking of using the team's trip to Qingdao to "return to his hometown in glory," should obtain the status of a team member. But soccer skills are a practical matter, and it's easy to see who is better or worse on the field, so it's impossible to fake it. It seemed this approach wouldn't work. So, Deputy Director Cui racked his brains day and night trying to come up with a solution.

    The team's departure time was fast approaching. Deputy Director Cui suddenly had a "bright idea": wouldn't he be able to go home if he got the title of team leader? So he immediately made an "urgent" phone call to the provincial bank, requesting that the provincial bank approve him as the team leader. The provincial bank simply said, "We have no opinion whether you go or not." They told Deputy Director Cui to discuss it with the office's director and ask for instructions from the Gan'nan District Party Committee. The clever Deputy Director Cui thought that if he discussed this honestly with the director and requested instructions from the District Party Committee, he might not be able to go to Qingdao. So Deputy Director Cui came up with a plan, deleting "or not" from the provincial bank's statement "We have no opinion whether you go or not," changing it to: "You go, we have no opinion." The director thought: since the provincial bank agreed to Deputy Director Cui's going, he had no objection either. Next, Deputy Director Cui also deceived the District Party Committee.

    Arriving in Wuhan, the team stayed for one day. Then someone brought an oral notice: the preparatory committee for the Central South Region basketball, volleyball, and football tryouts in the banking system announced that the football tryouts would not be held in Qingdao but in Wuhan. This news was undoubtedly a major blow to Deputy Director Cui. However, Deputy Director Cui was very good at "adhering to principles" on this issue, declaring: this news is unofficial and non-official, we must have organization and discipline, and absolutely obey the decisions of higher authorities. If he truly doubted the authenticity of this news, he could have seen the official notice from the head office at the Central South Region game preparatory committee, but Deputy Director Cui did not do so. Deputy Director Cui instructed the football captain to buy train tickets and ordered the players to prepare for departure. At that time, some people suggested that this was inappropriate, but Deputy Director Cui ignored them and resolutely led a large group of people to Qingdao.

    When the team arrived in Zhengzhou and had just checked into the Henan Provincial Branch's guesthouse, a comrade working at the guesthouse told him: the Central South Region game preparatory committee called and told you to quickly return to Wuhan to participate in the tryouts. Upon receiving this notice, Deputy Director Cui truly regretted that he had not stayed in a hotel. If he had stayed in a hotel, Wuhan would not have been able to find the Jiangxi football team. "I will not give up until my goal is achieved!" So Deputy Director Cui made a long-distance call to the Jiangxi Provincial Branch for instructions. The Provincial Branch instructed: obey the unified command of the Central South Region and immediately return to Wuhan to participate in the tryouts. It seemed there were no loopholes to exploit in the instructions from the Provincial Branch, but how could he "give up halfway?" He took emergency measures and called the head office directly, telling the head office: "The Jiangxi team traveled in two groups. Most of the players have arrived in Qingdao, and the remaining players have arrived in Zhengzhou." He requested the head office to allow the Jiangxi team to go to Qingdao. The head office considered that since some people had already gone to Qingdao, they should go to Qingdao! So, Deputy Director Cui triumphantly convened a general meeting of all team members, announcing the "good news" that the head office had approved the team to go to Qingdao. To prevent the head office from seeing through his deception, and so that the Qingdao side could prove that the Jiangxi team arrived in Qingdao in two groups, Deputy Director Cui divided the entire team into two groups, ordering one group to depart immediately and the other to stay in Zhengzhou and leave later. At the same time, he severely criticized the players who advocated returning to Wuhan for not having a strong "fighting spirit" and not being "principled," and he hated the players who criticized him for deceiving the organization.

    Paper cannot contain fire. Before the team arrived in Qingdao, the head office had already detected the trick played by Deputy Director Cui and told the Qingdao Branch: after the Jiangxi football team arrives in Qingdao, order them to return to Wuhan immediately. This was a bolt from the blue: just as Deputy Director Cui, with a very triumphant feeling and a smile of "victory," stepped on the land of his hometown that he had longed for for so long, what greeted him was not the smiling faces of his relatives, but the train tickets sent by the Qingdao Branch to return to Wuhan! In this way, Deputy Director Cui had to dejectedly lead his troops back to Wuhan.

    Perhaps some people thought that Deputy Director Cui's idea of "public-funded return to glory" would stop there? No, Deputy Director Cui, with his "indomitable" will, placed his hopes on the game. If the Jiangxi team won and went to Qingdao to participate in the national competition, he could still return home at public expense. Under the control of this idea, even more unethical things were done. In the football tryouts in Wuhan, there were only three teams: Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong. They played in a round-robin elimination format. In the first game, Jiangxi played Hubei and won; in the second game, Jiangxi played Guangdong. In the first half, Jiangxi led two to zero. In the second half, Guangdong scored two goals, and Deputy Director Cui became anxious. He thought that if Jiangxi could not win, his plan to "return to glory at public expense" would be completely bankrupt. At the same time, seeing that Guangdong's center forward number four had some "small moves" on the field, he cursed: "Damn it, take him out." This was of course a hint to his own team. So Guangdong's number four player was injured. Seeing this "desired" "result," Deputy Director Cui's face again floated with a triumphant smile. However, the smile did not stay on his face for long, because in the end, the Guangdong team defeated the Jiangxi team by three to two.

    In the third game, Guangdong played the Hubei team. Although Deputy Director Cui had ordered the two Jiangxi team members who were acting as linesmen to "find a way to get Guangdong a few eleven-meter penalties (i.e., penalize Guangdong for goal kicks)," in the end, his efforts were in vain—the Guangdong team obtained the right to participate in the national competition held in Qingdao.

    It seems that this case of "public-funded return to glory" should be closed here, but wait. When Deputy Director Cui learned that a team member had revealed to the Jiangxi Provincial Branch the inside story of his leadership's trip to Qingdao, he became enraged and immediately mobilized other team members to report that the person who reported him had "political problems." Such a person who, in order to achieve his personal goals, does not hesitate to take any means, even harming comrades, must not be allowed to run rampant.

    一个足球队的“领队”
    李力今
    前些日子，中国人民银行赣南办事处崔副主任听到了一个消息：赣南办事处的足球队，被决定代表江西省银行系统，参加全国银行系统在青岛举行的足球选拔赛。
    崔副主任听了这个消息非常高兴，而且开始了紧张的活动。崔副主任高兴的不是由于办事处的足球队能够荣幸地参加全国选拔赛；而是因为他自己可以设法借球队去青岛之便“荣归故里”。
    崔副主任想到要借球队去青岛之便“荣归故里”，似乎应该取得一个队员的身份。但球技是一个最实际的问题，一下场就可以看出谁高谁低，要瞒混也瞒混不了。看来这一着是行不通的。于是，崔副主任急得日夜想办法。
    球队出发的时间已很紧迫。崔副主任忽然急中生“智”，弄个球队领队的名义不就可以回家了吗？于是立即给省行挂了一个“加急”电话，要求省行批准他当球队的领队。省行只是说“你去或不去，我们没有意见。”要崔副主任和办事处正主任商量，并且向赣南区党委请示。聪明的崔副主任想，如果这样如实地同正主任商量，请示区党委，就可能去不成青岛。于是崔副主任心生一计，就从省行“你去或不去，我们没有意见”这句话上删去了“或不去”三个字，就变成了：“你去，我们没有意见”。正主任想：既然省行同意崔副主任去，也就没有意见。接着，崔副主任又骗过了区党委。
    到了武汉，球队停留了一天，就有人带来了口头通知：银行系统中南篮、排、足球选拔赛筹委会通知，决定足球选拔赛不在青岛举行，改在武汉举行。这个消息，对崔副主任无疑地是一个很大的打击。但是，崔副主任在这个问题上是很能“坚持原则”的，宣称：这个消息是非正式的、非官方的，我们要有组织性和纪律性，绝对服从上级的决定。如果是真正怀疑这个消息的真实性的话，那么到中南球赛筹委会就可看到总行的正式通知了，崔副主任却没有这样做。崔副主任一面指示足球队长买车票，一面命令队员准备出发。当时有人提出这样作不妥当，崔副主任置之不理，毅然率领一大队人马立即向青岛进发。
    球队到了郑州，刚刚住进河南省分行的招待所，招待所的工作同志就告诉他：中南球赛筹委会来电话，要你们赶快返回武汉参加选拔赛。得到这个通知，崔副主任真是自怨自艾，为什么自己不去住旅馆？如果住旅馆，武汉再来电话，也没法找到江西的足球代表队。“不达目的誓不休”，于是崔副主任给江西省分行打了个长途电话请示，省分行指示：要服从中南统一指挥，立即返回武汉参加选拔赛。看来从省行的指示里是没有空子可钻的了，但是，那能“半途而废”呢？他又采取了紧急措施，直接给总行打电话，对总行说：“江西代表队分两批走的，有一大部分队员已到青岛，剩下这部分队员已经到了郑州。”要求总行准许江西队去青岛。总行考虑既然已有人去青岛，就到青岛吧！于是，崔副主任洋洋得意地召开了一个全体队员大会，宣布了总行已经批准球队去青岛的“好消息”。为了防止总行识破他的骗局，使青岛方面能够证明江西代表队是两批到达青岛的，崔副主任就把全队分成了两批，命令一批立即出发，一批留在郑州晚一步走。同时严厉地批判了主张回武汉的队员是“斗争性”不强，“原则性”不高，对批评他欺骗组织的队员则恨之入骨。
    纸，是包不住火的，在球队还没到达青岛之前，总行已经察觉到崔副主任所玩的把戏，告诉青岛分行：江西足球代表队到达青岛后，就令他们立即返回武汉。这真是晴天霹雳：正当崔副主任怀着非常得意的心情，带着“胜利”以后的微笑，踏上他已缅怀多日的故乡土地上的时候，迎接他的不是亲人的笑脸，而是青岛分行送来返回武汉的车票！这样，崔副主任不得不垂头丧气地率领着自己的人马返回武汉。
    也许有人以为崔副主任“公费荣归”的念头总会到此打住了吧？不，有着“百折不挠”的意志的崔副主任又把希望寄托在球赛上了，如果江西队得胜，去青岛参加全国赛，他还是可以假公济私地回一趟家。在这一思想支配下，更缺德的事情作出来了。在武汉参加足球选拔赛的只有江西、湖北和广东三个队，采取循环淘汰的方式比赛。第一场江西对湖北，江西获胜；第二场江西对广东，上半场二比零，江西占先，下半场广东中两球，崔副主任有些着急了，他想到江西如果不能获胜，“公费荣归”的打算就彻底破产。同时看到广东队中锋四号在球场上有些“小动作”，就骂了一句：“他妈的，把他干掉。”这当然是给自己球队的一个暗示。于是广东队的四号队员就负伤了。看到这个“如愿以偿”的“结果”，崔副主任脸上又浮上了得意的微笑。但是，笑，并没有在他脸上停留多久，因为全场比赛的结果，广东队以三比二战胜了江西队。
    第三场，广东对湖北队，虽然崔副主任曾经命令江西队的两个当巡边员的同志，要“想法搞广东队几个十一公尺（即罚广东队的门球）”，结果，还是枉费心机——广东队取得了参加在青岛举行的全国赛的权利。
    似乎，这桩“公费荣归”的公案应该就此结案了，不，且慢。当崔副主任知道有个队员向江西省分行揭露了他领队去青岛的底细以后，就恼羞成怒，立刻发动另外的队员检举这个反映者有“政治问题”。对于这样一个为了达到个人目的、不惜采取一切手段甚至陷害同志的人，决不能让他横行到底。
