Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 30th – Many agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province are implementing a relatively advanced individual responsibility system for field production management during summer production. It plays a significant role in inspiring members' enthusiasm, overcoming inefficient labor allocation and management, improving current production, and realizing the annual agricultural production increase plan.

Generally, this method involves each production team within the agricultural cooperative, based on the year-round contract work and output system. During summer production, tasks that can be individually managed, such as weeding and cotton field management, are discussed among the team members. Based on their skills and available labor, a certain number of mu (unit of area) are assigned to them for responsible management. This method was created by some older cooperatives based on past experience. By the end of July, many well-established agricultural cooperatives in the province were implementing this management method during summer production. In Shen County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, during weeding and inter-tillage, 205 out of 305 agricultural cooperatives had implemented the method of group-contracted plots and individual-contracted rows within the production team. In Xingtai County, Xingtai Prefecture, more than 150 cooperatives, accounting for half of the total number of cooperatives in the county, contracted the summer management of various major crops to individual households. In Nanhe County, cooperatives implementing this method also accounted for 60% of the county's agricultural cooperatives.

According to inspections in various areas, implementing this method has the following benefits: First, it can strengthen members' sense of responsibility for field management of crops and unleash their enthusiasm. For example, after implementing this method, Li Qingfu, a member of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Changli County, discovered that the dry-sown sweet potato seed tubers in a neighboring village were moldy while visiting relatives. He immediately returned home and rushed to check the dry-sown sweet potato field under his management. Many members of this cooperative are now able to proactively make suggestions to the production team leader and captain regarding farm work arrangements and production improvements based on the agricultural season. Second, the production team leader does not need to temporarily assign work, wait for everyone to arrive in the fields, and divide the work at the field head. After members contract the rows, they can also go to the fields earlier and finish work later, arranging farm work according to their own time, which can improve labor efficiency. According to key investigations in Xingtai, Nanhe, and other counties, after contracting weeding and inter-tillage to individual cooperative members, labor efficiency generally increased by 20-30% compared to before. Third, clear responsibility facilitates inspection, evaluation, and rewards, which can improve the quality of farm work. When weeding seedlings, the Sixth Production Team of the Wugong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Raoyang County implemented the individual responsibility system of row-contracted management, which corrected the phenomenon of some members neglecting quality and ensured that quality requirements were met. After implementing the field management responsibility system, the Xishahe Township Agricultural Cooperative promptly commended and rewarded more than 100 members who were diligent and paid attention to quality because it was easy to inspect and evaluate, which prompted members to pay attention to quality.

Agricultural cooperatives that have adopted this method have generally achieved good results in current production. After implementing this method, the Hongqi Cooperative in Changli County did not have a single mu of seedling shortage out of its 20,000 mu of crops this year, despite the heavy rainfall, wet land, and busy and intense farm work. In Nangong County, after the agricultural cooperatives sowed 500,000 mu of cotton fields, they implemented team-contracted areas, group-contracted plots, and individual-contracted rows. They have now pruned the branches three times and treated the fields for pests four times in a timely manner. The first generation of cotton bollworms was quickly eliminated at the first instar upon discovery. The cotton is growing better than in previous years.

According to the experience of agricultural cooperatives in various areas, in implementing the member's individual responsibility system for crop management, it is necessary to pay attention to leveraging members' expertise (such as women being good at cotton field management), taking into account members' special difficulties, and resolving the integration of individual responsibilities with concentrated, intensive farm work such as drought resistance, flood prevention, and pest control. According to local experience, these issues can be properly addressed after discussion and consultation with the members. When discussing how to allocate the rows, many teams in the Wugong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Raoyang County allocated more cotton field management to female laborers after repeated and full consultation with the members, and also allocated land closer to the village to them, so the vast majority of members were satisfied. At the same time, the leadership should also handle matters based on the specific circumstances and members' requests. Whether to contract to groups, households, or individuals, which crops and what tasks to contract, should be decided by each cooperative and team themselves, and uniformity should not be forced.

    河北省许多农业合作社在夏季生产中
    实行田间管理个人负责制
    社员责任心加强，劳动效率和农活质量提高
    据新华社保定30日电　河北省许多农业生产合作社，在夏季生产中推行了一种比较先进的个人负责的田间生产管理方法。它对启发社员积极性，克服劳力指挥不开支配不当，搞好当前生产和实现全年的农业增产计划，有很大作用。
    这种方法一般的是：农业社的各生产队在全年包工包产的基础上，在夏季生产中，队内把可以由个人负责的农活如除草、棉田管理等，经队内社员讨论，根据社员特长和可能出工的数量，划出一定的亩数交由他们负责管理。这种方法是一些老社根据过去的经验创造的。到七月底止，这个省许多基础较好的农业社都在夏季生产当中实行了这种管理方法。石家庄专区深县在锄草中耕时，305个农业社，已有205个社实行了生产队内的组包块、人包垅的办法。邢台专区的邢台县；将各种主要作物的夏季管理包到户的社有一百五十多个，占全县总社数一半。南和县实行这种办法的社，也占全县农业社的60％。
    根据各地检查，实行这种办法有以下几种好处：一、能够加强社员对于农作物的田间管理的责任心，发挥社员的积极性。如昌黎县红旗农业社实行这个办法后，社员李庆福在走亲时发现外村的旱直播甘薯种薯霉烂，便立刻回家跑到他负责管理的旱直播甘薯地里去检查。这个社许多社员现在都能根据农时，积极主动地向生产组长、队长提出农活安排和改进生产的建议。二、生产队长不用临时派工、等齐下地、地头分活了。社员包垅后又可早下地晚收工，根据自己的时间安排农活，这样就能提高劳动效率。据邢台、南和等县重点调查，将锄草中耕分别包给各户社员后，劳动效率一般都较前提高了百分之二、三十。三、责任分明，便于检查，便于评比奖励，可以提高农活质量。饶阳县五公乡农业社第六生产队锄苗时实行了包垅管理的个人负责制，便纠正了一些社员忽视质量的现象，都达到了质量要求。西沙河乡农业社实行田间管理责任制后，因为容易检查、评比，及时表扬奖励了一百多名劳动积极注意质量的社员，促使社员都注意了质量。
    采取这种办法的农业社，对当前的生产都搞得很好。昌黎县红旗社实行这种办法后，在今年雨多地湿、农活相当繁忙紧张的情况下，全社的两万亩庄稼没有一亩苗荒。南宫县各农业社的五十万亩棉田，自播种后实行队包片、组包块、人包垅，现在已及时整过三遍枝，治过四次虫，第一代棉铃虫一发现，就被迅速地消灭在一龄里。棉花比哪年都长的好。
    根据各地农业社的经验，实行农作物管理的社员个人负责制，必须注意发挥社员专长（如妇女善于棉田管理）照顾社员特殊困难，和解决个人分管与抗旱、防汛、治虫等集中突击性农活的结合等问题。根据各地经验，这些问题交社员讨论协商后，都能得到适当的处理。饶阳县五公乡农业社，在进行讨论怎样分垅时，经过社员反复充分的协商，许多队都把棉田管理多分配给女劳力，并且分给了她们离村较近的地，因此绝大多数社员都满意。同时，领导上还要根据具体情况与社员要求办事，包给组、包给户还是包给人，包哪几种庄稼和什么活，应允许各社各队自己决定，不应强求划一。
