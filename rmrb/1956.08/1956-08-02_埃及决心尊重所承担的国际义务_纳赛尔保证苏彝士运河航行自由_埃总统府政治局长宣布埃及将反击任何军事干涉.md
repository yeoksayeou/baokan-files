Xinhua News Agency, August 1st, Cairo dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser issued a statement on July 31st saying that freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal will not be affected by the nationalization of the canal.

	Nasser's statement was released to reporters by Ali Sabri, Secretary of the Political Bureau of the Presidential Palace. The statement has been sent to Egyptian embassies abroad, foreign diplomatic representatives in Cairo, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, so that the world can know the position taken by Egypt on the Suez Canal issue.

	Nasser said in the statement, "On July 26, 1956, the Suez Canal was nationalized. However, the action of the Egyptian government in exercising its rights has aroused some opposition from a few governments, especially the governments of France and the United Kingdom. This opposition is without any basis.

	"The Suez Canal Company has always been an Egyptian company, and like all other Egyptian companies, it can be nationalized.

	"This nationalization will not affect, in any way or to any extent, the international obligations undertaken by Egypt.

	"We remain determined to respect all our international obligations; and the guarantees in this regard in the 1888 Convention and the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement will be fully maintained now and in the future. Freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal will not be affected or implicated in any way or to any extent.

	"Moreover, no one is more concerned than Egypt about the freedom of passage and the prosperity of traffic on the canal.

	"We believe that the traffic situation on the canal in the years to come will not disappoint all our hopes and the hopes of the entire world.

	"Egypt believes that its position is just, and it will not be diverted from the direction it has set for itself in this regard, but will continue to move forward for its own interests and the interests of the great family of world nations."

	After Sabri handed over the above statement to reporters, he was asked what Egypt was prepared to do, given reports that Britain might take "some naval action" in the Eastern Mediterranean. Sabri said, "We have to wait and see."

	He said that if any country carries out military intervention against the nationalization of the Suez Canal, "Egypt will retaliate."

	He also said, "Egypt will not allow foreign warships to be stationed in the ports of the Suez Canal unless they are on friendly visits."

    埃及决心尊重所承担的国际义务
    纳赛尔保证苏彝士运河航行自由
    埃总统府政治局长宣布埃及将反击任何军事干涉
    新华社1日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔七月三十一日发表声明说，苏彝士运河的航行自由不会因为这条运河的国有化而受到影响。
    纳赛尔的声明是由总统府政治局长阿里·萨布里向记者发布的。这项声明已经送交埃及驻外国的大使馆、各国驻开罗的外交代表和联合国秘书长，以便让全世界都知道埃及在苏彝士运河问题上所采取的立场。
    纳赛尔在声明中说，“在1956年7月26日，苏彝士运河国有化了。然而，埃及政府行使它的权利的行动引起了少数政府的某种反对，特别是法国和联合王国政府的反对。这种反对是没有任何根据的。
    “苏彝士运河公司一直是一个埃及公司，像所有其他埃及公司一样，可以加以国有化。
    “这一国有化不会以任何方式或在任何程度上影响埃及承担的国际义务。
    “我们仍旧决心尊重我们所承担的一切国际义务；而且1888年的公约和1954年英埃协定中有关这方面的保证在现在和将来都会得到充分的维持。苏彝士运河上的航行自由不会以任何方式或在任何程度上受到影响或连累。
    “而且，没有人能比埃及更关心通行自由和运河上交通运输的昌盛了。
    “我们相信，在今后的年代中运河上的交通运输情况将不辜负我们的所有希望和整个世界的希望。
    “埃及相信它的立场是正义的，它不会被转移脱离它在这方面为自己制定的方向，而是将为了它自己的利益和世界国家大家庭的利益继续前进。”
    在萨布里把上述声明交给记者以后，有人问他，鉴于有消息说英国可能在东地中海采取“某种海军行动”，埃及准备怎么办。萨布里说，“我们必须等着瞧。”
    他说，如果任何国家对苏彝士运河国有化进行军事干涉，“埃及将予以反击”。
    他又说，“埃及将不允许外国军舰驻在苏彝士运河的港口，除非是进行友好访问。”
