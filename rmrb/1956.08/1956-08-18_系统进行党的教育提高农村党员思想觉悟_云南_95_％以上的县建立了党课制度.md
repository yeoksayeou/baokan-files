    Systematically Conduct Party Education to Raise the Ideological Awareness of Rural Party Members
    Over 95% of Counties in Yunnan Have Established Party Class Systems

    (Our Newspaper News) Yunnan Province's Party organizations at all levels have made considerable achievements in establishing and improving the Party class system. Now, over 95% of the counties have adopted the Party class education method. It has played a significant role in educating rural Party members on basic Party knowledge, inner-Party democracy, and connecting with the masses to overcome undesirable tendencies within the Party.
    Not long ago, the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee inspected the branch education work in several regions. The results of the inspection showed that the vast majority of rural Party members were eager to attend Party classes and systematically receive Party education. The county and district committees generally valued the education of rural Party members, and no one used various excuses to oppose attending Party classes anymore. Often, before the county committee had made a unified arrangement, some district committees would take the initiative to start Party classes. In order to further enhance the Party spirit of rural Party members and strengthen the role of the branch as a fighting fortress, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department made further arrangements regarding rural branch education work, requiring the propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels to effectively manage Party classes. From now until September, rural branch education, in conjunction with conveying the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, will conduct education on the tasks of the socialist revolution and the new situation of the socialist revolution in rural areas, especially on the current tasks of rural branches and the mass line, so that all Party members understand that the task of the Party in rural areas in the future is to properly manage existing agricultural cooperatives, ensure increased production, continuously improve labor productivity, improve the people's material and cultural life, consciously overcome bureaucratic and commandist thinking and working styles, and further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, in order to resist the influence of various capitalist and small producer ideologies. In terms of education methods, in addition to regularly educating Party members through various work meetings and Party training classes, counties that have already established a Party class system should adhere to and improve it; counties that have not established a Party class system should quickly establish it and persist in it. In order to save manpower and improve the quality of lectures, whether in mountainous or plain areas, the Party class transmission system can be adopted, that is, the branch selects one to three part-time teachers, and the county Party Committee Propaganda Department regularly tutors the Party class teachers, organizing them to return to the branch to impart knowledge to Party members. This transmission method has achieved good results in various places.

    系统进行党的教育提高农村党员思想觉悟
    云南95％以上的县建立了党课制度
    本报讯　云南省各级党的组织在建立健全党课制度方面，取得相当成就。现在已有95％以上的县采用了党课教育方式。在对农村党员进行党的基本知识、党内民主以及联系群众克服党内不良倾向方面，都起了很大的作用。
    不久以前，中共云南省委宣传部检查了几个地区的支部教育工作。检查结果说明，广大农村党员都迫切要求上党课，系统地接受党的教育。县、区委对农村党员的教育一般是重视的，已经没有人再以各种借口来反对上党课，往往县委还没统一布置，有的区委就主动地去上党课了。为了进一步增强农村党员党性，加强支部战斗的堡垒作用，关于农村支部教育工作，省委宣传部作了进一步的布置，要求各级党委宣传部门对党课加以切实的管理。从现在起到九月，农村支部教育结合传达省党代表大会精神，进行社会主义革命任务和当前农村中社会主义革命新形势的教育，特别是关于当前农村支部任务和群众路线的教育，以便使全体党员懂得今后党在农村中的任务是必须办好现有的农业社，保证增产，不断地提高劳动生产率，提高人民物质文化生活，自觉地克服官僚主义和命令主义的思想作风，进一步密切党和群众的关系，以抵制各种资本主义思想和小生产者思想影响。在教育方式上，除通过各种工作会议及党的训练班等经常对党员进行教育外，凡已建立党课制度的县，应加以坚持和健全；凡是没有建立党课制度的县，应该迅速建立起来，并坚持下去。为了节省人力，提高讲课质量，不论山区或平原地区，都可采用党课传授制，即由支部选拔兼职教员一至三人，由县委宣传部对党课教员定期加以辅导，组织他们回支部向党员传授。这种传授办法，在各地都得到了良好的效果。
