　　Chengdu, August 30th (from our newspaper) Wanxian and Leshan Special Districts in Sichuan Province have recently inspected and corrected false phenomena in the preliminary distribution trials of annual income in some agricultural cooperatives. In these areas, some agricultural cooperatives, failing to proceed from reality, have adopted methods such as increasing production indices, expanding the calculation of sideline income, and arbitrarily adding work points in order to meet the principle of increasing income for 90% of cooperative members and not decreasing income for 10% of cooperative members.

　　The Gaojian Agricultural Cooperative in Fenshui Township, Wanxian County, could only increase production by about 15% this year. However, when the cooperative cadres conducted the preliminary distribution calculation, they raised the production increase target to 52%. In the preliminary distribution calculation of the Qingle Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Guanying Township, Leshan County, it was found that some cooperative members could not increase their income, so they expanded the calculation of sideline income to make up for it. Even the fifty fattened pigs planned to be raised within the cooperative were counted as actual income in the distribution plan. When the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Tuzhu Township of this county conducted the preliminary distribution calculation, they arbitrarily added work points to some farmers who could not increase their income. For example, cooperative member Han Miaoxian is a semi-laborer, and she has only done and may only do one hundred work points in the future, but the cooperative calculated three hundred and twenty work points for her. Some agricultural cooperatives have taken advantage of the recent opportunity of the state increasing grain prices, calculating cooperative members' income last year based on last year's grain prices and calculating this year's income based on the current increased grain prices. In this way, the income appears to have increased in terms of currency value, but when calculated in terms of grain, the income is actually less than last year. As a result, some cooperative members who were originally going to have reduced income have nominally increased their income. Many cooperative members sarcastically say: "This is called spiritually increasing income."

　　The reason for this situation is that some resident cadres and cooperative cadres have an insufficient understanding of the purpose and significance of the preliminary distribution calculation, and only seek immediate pleasure in the accounting, regardless of whether it can be cashed in the future. In addition, some cooperatives set unrealistic "thousand-jin cooperative" plans during the spring plowing and production, and now they are afraid of being ridiculed by others for failing to complete the plan, so they deliberately falsely report yields and increase production targets.

　　Currently, the relevant leading departments in these areas are inspecting and correcting these deviations. Some cooperatives in the Wanxian area with overestimated yields are re-estimating production and conducting preliminary calculations in conjunction with the autumn harvest. The Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has also instructed its subordinate areas to conduct a general inspection of the preliminary calculation work to correct various false phenomena.

### 四川省万县、乐山等专区  纠正农业社分配试算中的虚假现象

    四川省万县、乐山等专区
    纠正农业社分配试算中的虚假现象
    本报成都30日电　四川省万县、乐山等专区最近检查纠正了部分农业社在进行全年收益分配试算中的虚假现象。这些地区的某些农业社在分配试算中，不从实际出发，采取提高增产指数、扩大计算副业收入和乱加工分等方法，以图符合90％的社员增加收入和10％的社员不减少收入的原则。
    万县分水乡高枧农业社今年实际只能增产15％左右，社干部在试算分配时，却将增产指标提高到52％。乐山县冠英乡青乐第四农业社在试算分配中，发现有些社员不能增加收入，就扩大计算副业收入来弥补，连社内计划饲养的五十头肥猪，也被作为实际收入算在分配方案之内。这个县的土主乡红星农业社试算分配时，对一些不能增加收入的农户就凭空给他们加工分。如社员韩妙仙是个半劳动力，她已做的和今后可能做的只有一百个工分，社内却给她算了三百二十个工分。还有一些农业社趁着最近国家提高粮食价格的机会，按去年的粮价算社员去年的收入，用现在提高后的粮价算今年的收入。这样，从币值来看是增加了收入，但是按粮食计算，收入反比去年减少了。这样，有些原来要减少收入的社员便形式上增加了收入。许多社员都以讽刺的口吻说：“这叫做精神增加收入”。
    产生这种情况的原因，是部分驻社干部和社干部对试算分配的目的和意义认识不足，算账只图眼前皆大喜欢，不管将来能否兑现。另外，有的社在春耕生产时订了不切合实际的“千斤社”的计划，现在看到完不成计划，怕别人讥笑，因此故意谎报产量，提高增产指标。
    目前，这些地区的有关领导部门正检查纠正这些偏向。万县地区有些估产偏高的社，正结合秋收，重新估产试算。中共乐山地委也指示所属各地普遍检查一次试算工作，纠正各种虚假现象。
