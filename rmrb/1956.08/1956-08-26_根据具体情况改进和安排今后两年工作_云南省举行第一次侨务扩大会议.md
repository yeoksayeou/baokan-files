Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 24th: The seven-day Yunnan Province's First Expanded Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference concluded on the 22nd. More than 300 representatives of various ethnic groups from border autonomous prefectures (regions) and nine special districts, including Yuxi and Mengzi, and two cities, participated in the conference.

The conference conveyed the spirit of the Fourth Expanded Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, reviewed the shortcomings and problems existing in Yunnan Province's implementation of domestic overseas Chinese affairs policies since liberation, and arranged overseas Chinese affairs work for the next two years based on the actual situation in Yunnan Province.

There are approximately 50,000 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Yunnan Province. In the past few years, the overseas Chinese affairs departments in Yunnan Province have basically correctly implemented domestic overseas Chinese affairs policies in handling various overseas Chinese affairs issues. As a result, the patriotism and socialist consciousness of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese throughout the province have significantly improved. More than 90% of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in rural areas have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and many agricultural labor models have emerged, some of whom have become the main cadres of cooperatives or township governments. Some returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese with certain skills and considerable cultural levels have generally been assigned to work in industrial and mining, transportation, trade, or cultural and educational departments according to their specialties. Some of those with poorer skills have also undergone short-term technical studies and professional training in their jobs. Many of these people have won the title of advanced worker or outstanding youth of "good health, good study, and good work." Since 1955, due to widespread publicity of the overseas remittance policy and the handling of incidents involving the infringement of overseas remittances, remittances have continuously increased, and the production and living needs of relatives of overseas Chinese have been met in a timely manner.

However, due to the lack of in-depth practical investigation and research and close contact with the masses in the work of various levels of overseas Chinese affairs departments, there have been shortcomings in the work of overseas Chinese affairs in recent years, such as generalized leadership and insufficient consideration of the characteristics of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. For example, in the unified purchase and sale of grain, insufficient consideration was given to the labor and technical conditions and certain special grain needs of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in rural areas. Assessments were based solely on land conditions, resulting in generally high assessments. There was also a lack of reasonable arrangements for their labor in agricultural cooperatives. In addition, the publicity of overseas Chinese affairs policies to the masses was also insufficient. These shortcomings were seriously criticized at the meeting, and suggestions for improvement were put forward.

After discussion and research, the meeting believed that the problems in realizing socialist agricultural cooperation in overseas Chinese hometowns and the specific difficulties of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in production should be investigated and dealt with in conjunction with the rectification of cooperatives before autumn, to prepare for the basic realization of socialist agricultural cooperation this winter and next spring. In addition, it was requested that all localities actively develop diversified economies in overseas Chinese hometowns according to local conditions, such as animal husbandry, forestry, horticulture, and other rural sideline occupations. Special support should be given to needy overseas Chinese households to ensure that more than 90% of cooperatives increase production and more than 90% of overseas Chinese household members increase their income. In addition to doing a good job in asset verification and fixed interest payments for overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, it is also necessary to improve public-private relations and appropriately adjust and arrange agents and relatives of overseas Chinese enterprises.

Due to Yunnan's superior climate conditions and many barren hills and wastelands, overseas Chinese hometowns can also greatly develop tropical and subtropical cash crops. The government is prepared to allocate large areas of land and should mobilize overseas Chinese to actively manage them. At the same time, it is prepared to establish an Overseas Chinese Investment Committee to welcome overseas Chinese investment in local industries. The meeting also put forward specific suggestions for future work concerning returned overseas Chinese workers, staff and students.

    根据具体情况改进和安排今后两年工作
    云南省举行第一次侨务扩大会议
    新华社昆明24日电　历时七天的云南省第一次侨务扩大会议在二十二日闭幕。来自边疆各自治州（区）和玉溪、蒙自等九个专区、两个市的三百多个各族代表参加了这次会议。
    会议传达了中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会第四次侨务扩大会议决议的精神，检查了云南省解放几年来，在贯彻执行国内侨务政策方面所存在的缺点和问题，并根据云南省的实际情况安排了今后两年内的侨务工作。
    云南省归侨和侨眷约有五万人。几年来，云南省侨务部门在处理各项侨务问题中，基本上正确执行了国内侨务政策，因此，全省广大归侨、侨眷的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟有显著提高。农村中90％以上的归侨、侨眷都已参加了农业生产合作社，涌现了不少农业劳动模范，有的已成为合作社或乡政权的主要干部，一些具有某种技能和相当文化水平的归侨、侨眷，一般都已按照他们的特长分配在工矿、交通运输、贸易或文教等部门工作，一部分技术较差的，还在工作岗位上进行了短期的技术学习和业务进修。这些人当中，有很多都已获得先进工作者的称号，或者是“身体好、学习好、工作好”的优秀青年。1955年以来，由于广泛宣传了侨汇政策，和处理了侵犯侨汇的事件，使侨汇不断增多，侨眷生产和生活上的需要都得到及时解决。
    但是，由于各级侨务部门在工作中还缺乏深入实际的调查研究和密切联系群众的工作作风，因此，几年来在侨务工作中存在着领导一般化和对归侨、侨眷的特点照顾不够的缺点。例如，在粮食统购统销中，对农村的归侨、侨眷的劳动技术条件与某些特殊用粮需要考虑不够，单纯凭土地条件评产，结果一般评产偏高；对他们在农业社中的劳动力也缺乏合理安排；另外，向群众宣传侨务政策也不够经常。会上对这些缺点都作了严肃的批评，提出了改进的意见。
    会议经过讨论研究以后，认为今后在侨乡实现社会主义农业合作化中的问题和生产中归侨、侨眷的具体困难，应在秋前结合整社工作进行调查、处理，为今冬明春基本实现农业社会主义合作化作好准备；另外要求各地因地制宜，积极发展侨乡的多种经济，如畜牧、林业、园艺以及其它农村副业。对有困难的侨户进行特殊扶持，保证90％以上的合作社增加生产和90％以上的侨户社员增加收入。对华侨工商业者，除作好核资、定息等工作外，还要改进公私关系和适当地调整与安排华侨企业代理人和侨眷。
    由于云南气候条件优越，荒山荒地很多，所以侨乡还可以大量发展热带和亚热带经济作物，政府准备拨出的大片土地，应动员华侨积极经营。同时，准备成立华侨投资委员会，欢迎华侨投资经营地方工业。会议对归侨职工和学生方面的今后工作也提出了具体意见。
