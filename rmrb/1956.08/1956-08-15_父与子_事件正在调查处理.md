    "Father and Son" Incident Under Investigation

    The article "Father and Son" published in this newspaper on July 19th has attracted the attention of a wide readership. As of August 14th, we have received more than 580 letters from readers. In their letters, readers expressed their indignation at Zhang Fengru's abusive behavior towards his father and the lenient attitude of the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and demanded serious action. We have requested the Shanxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party to investigate and handle this matter.

    “父与子”事件正在调查处理
    本报七月十九日发表的“父与子”一文，引起了广大读者的注意。到八月十四日止，已经收到读者来信五百八十多封。读者在来信里，对张枫如虐待父亲的行为和中共阳泉市委的姑息态度，表示愤慨，并且要求严肃处理。这事件，我们正请中共山西省委监察委员会调查处理。
