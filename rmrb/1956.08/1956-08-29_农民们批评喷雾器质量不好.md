    Farmers Criticize Poor Quality of Sprayers
    Our agricultural technology extension station is responsible this year for ensuring disease prevention and increased production for more than 8,500 mu of potatoes. The main technical measure taken in the summer is spraying copper sulfate solution during the potato growing season. From the beginning of June to mid-July, we purchased a total of 176 compression sprayers produced in Shandong and Tianjin. When these sprayers were first delivered, the members of the agricultural production cooperatives welcomed them. However, in less than five days, more than 90% developed problems such as leaks in the water tank and air leaks in the air cylinder. The Nanhebao Agricultural Production Cooperative bought a total of 70 sprayers, including 50 from Shandong. Now only one is still usable. Of the 20 from Tianjin, only two are still usable. These sprayers have been generally repaired twice by coppersmiths, and the repair costs alone have exceeded 46 yuan. Currently, more than 60% of these 170-plus sprayers are still incomplete and unusable.
    Because of the sprayer troubles, our plan for the third spraying of copper sulfate solution has become problematic. However, potato late blight is spreading rampantly. These broken sprayers are really harmful!

    Farmers in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, bought a batch of troublesome sprayers this year. The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative bought 14 single-tube sprayers, and eight broke after only one day of use. Three had not even been used yet when leaks were found at the "outlet joint," so the brand-new sprayers had to be repaired first. The Star Agricultural Production Cooperative bought eight sprayers, and all were repaired twice after five applications of pesticide. The Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative bought 14 sprayers, and nine were repaired after being used twice. The main problems with these sprayers are leaks, or the "nozzle" becoming blocked and spraying pesticide directly onto people from the air cylinder. This has resulted in many cases of poisoning. When the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative used single-tube sprayers to spray the highly toxic insecticide "1605," four people were poisoned in one day because the machines were leaking everywhere. Two people were poisoned in the Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, one of whom was severely poisoned. As a result, many members are afraid to spray "1605" pesticide, which has hindered pest control work in the cotton fields.
    Many farmers are discussing: These bad things must have been made by people who cut corners. But these are products of the state-owned Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory, not the work of unscrupulous merchants. So, why is the quality so bad? Please, Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory, answer! Chao Liting

### 农民们批评喷雾器质量不好

    农民们批评喷雾器质量不好
    我们这个农业技术推广站，今年担负着保证八千五百多亩马铃薯防病增产的任务。夏季主要采取在马铃薯生长期喷打硫酸铜液等技术措施。从6月开始到7月中旬，我们共购买了山东和天津生产的压缩式喷雾器一百七十六架。这些喷雾器刚运到的时候，农业生产合作社社员们很欢迎。但是用了不到五天，90％以上就发生了盛水筒漏水、气筒跑气等毛病。南河堡农业生产合作社共买了七十架，其中山东出的五十架，现在只有一架还好使，天津出的二十架，只有两架好使。这些喷雾器已经普遍找铜锡匠修过两次，单修理费就花了四十六元多。现在，这一百七十多架喷雾器，60％以上还是残缺不全，无法使用。
    因为喷雾器捣乱，我们第三次喷硫酸铜液的计划便成问题了。但是，马铃薯晚疫病正在猖狂地流行。这些破烂喷雾器真是害人不浅呵！

    江西省九江县农民今年买了一批伤脑筋的喷雾器。红星农业生产合作社买的十四架单管喷雾器，只用了一天就坏了八架，有三架还没有用，就发现“出水接头”上漏药水，崭新的喷雾器就得先进行修理。明星农业生产合作社买的八架喷雾器，打了五次药水，一律修了两次。五星农业生产合作社买的十四架喷雾器，用过两次就修理了九架。这些喷雾器主要的毛病，是漏药水，或者在“喷头”堵塞的时候从气筒里直接向人身上喷药水。结果造成了许多中毒事故。红星农业生产合作社用单管喷雾器喷射“一六○五”毒性杀虫药剂的时候，因为机器满身破漏，在一天内中毒的就有四人。明星农业生产合作社中毒的有两个人，其中有一个中毒非常严重。这样一来，许多社员都不敢去打“一六○五”药水了，结果妨碍了棉田除虫工作。
    许多农民在议论：这些坏东西，准是制造的人偷工减料了。但是这是地方国营上海农业药械厂的产品，并非奸商所做所为。那末，质量为什么这么坏呢？请上海农业药械厂来答复一下吧！　巢理庭
