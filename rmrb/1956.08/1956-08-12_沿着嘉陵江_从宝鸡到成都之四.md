Along the Jialing River—From Baoji to Chengdu, Part Four
By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

For several days, I have been traveling along the banks of the Jialing River. The滔滔 (tāo tāo - torrential) river water, beating against cliffs, colliding with boulders, swirling into eddies, splashing into waves, like a giant python, sometimes roaring through steep gorges, sometimes rushing wildly through open river sources. For many years, it has flowed through the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan, blocking travelers from crossing the river. An ancient Chinese poet once described the Jialing River in this way:

	"Carving stones to release rushing torrents, hailed as the ancient Yu the Great's feat,
	Night renders the mountain store hazy, a lonely sleep on an uneasy mat.
	Water's nature is inherently quiet, stones themselves make no sound,
	How can the two collide, thunder rolling, startling the empty mountains?"

Today, the torrents of the Jialing River, although still as turbulent and roaring as in the past, have been subdued by the road builders fighting day and night on the river, becoming even more compliant. They have cut through towering mountains on the river, built many magnificent bridges, and allowed the torrents to change their old river course.

Moving Rivers and Shifting Mountains

This is Sanduishui and Lijia Mountain in Liangdang County, Gansu. The Jialing River, rushing down from the southern foothills of the Qinling Mountains, is suddenly blocked by a stone mountain lying across the river valley; then, it winds around two large "V" shapes along the narrow mountain valley. If the Baoji-Chengdu Railway passing through here were to follow the usual method of tunneling through mountains, it would have to build four large bridges and cross the Jialing River four times within a distance of four kilometers, which would inevitably delay the progress of the project. Later, based on the suggestion of Soviet expert Chichikin, it was decided to blast open two mountains in the middle, which would not only save several bridges but also advance the project.

Captain Feng Huanan, who was responsible for carrying out this blasting mission, although he was a combat engineer company commander who had personally destroyed many enemy bunkers, couldn't help but feel a little timid in the face of the large explosion of 263 tons of explosives.

"Success only, no failure; we must blast open a mountain with one shot!" Under the guidance of Soviet experts, after more than a month of preparation, Captain Feng repeatedly instructed the youth shock brigade leader, Tian Kehui, before the detonation. The explosion began with a deafening roar, and a cloud of thick smoke rose from the foot of the mountain, instantly obscuring half the sky. In a violent earthquake, Lijia Mountain was split open with a wide river channel, and the river suddenly changed direction, rushing straight south.

Standing on the newly built embankment-like roadbed by the river, Captain Feng Huanan pointed to the more than 40-meter-wide gap and said to me:

"You see, it took Yu the Great many years to carve the Dragon Gate, but we only used three seconds to blast open a mountain!"

Attacking the Riverbed

Among the struggles of the road construction workers to conquer thousands of rivers, streams, and sixteen crossings of the Jialing River, the construction of the Zhan'erxiang No. 10 Bridge was the most difficult. Although the span of this bridge is not long, it is the key to whether the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be opened to traffic ahead of schedule. The No. 3 pier here—the last pier of the entire line—suddenly encountered an accident during pouring. The raging river suddenly turned sharply eastward in front of a stone cliff, eroding the riverbed rock layer into a steep slope with one side high and the other low; at the same time, half of the foundation of the No. 3 pier was bottomless quicksand and slippery mud, while the other half was blocked by a sloping isolated rock. Building a bridge on such an unstable foundation was as risky as building a tall building on a beach. Therefore, the quicksand and slippery mud must be quickly removed from the riverbed; otherwise, the caisson cannot be placed firmly in the rapids.

"Comrades: We must break through this last barrier!" Captain Lu mobilized all the workers. Diver Li Wenju and others immediately took wind drills and dived into the turbulent river, swimming and groping underwater to drill, blast, and dig sand. Although breathing was very difficult at the bottom of the water, and their heads would become dizzy with the slightest movement, they took turns working in the water for thirty-six consecutive hours. They cleared the reefs and quicksand, lowered the caisson, and drove steel pipes around the caisson. At this time, the rapids suddenly rushed in, bringing a surge of mud and sand through the gaps in the steel pipe foundation, burying six workers inside the caisson. When the situation was extremely dangerous, excavation squad leader Bai Dengke was the first to grab the steel rope and break free from the quicksand, and he helped others escape the danger. Later, they drove steel pipes into the caisson and used the internal pressure grouting and drainage sinking method to overcome the back sand in the riverbed, and finally erected a tall pier in the turbulent heart of the river. When we arrived here, the bridge-laying machine coming from the north was stretching its giant arm, like an eagle grabbing a chick, installing steel beams one by one on top of the pier.

Brave Boatmen

The beautiful Tanjiachuang in Huixian County is adorned like a large garden with verdant green trees, red pomegranate flowers, and fruit trees laden with loquats and walnuts. Wooden boats occasionally floated down between the green mountains and turbulent currents. When the night crept up from the foot of the mountains and the lights began to appear on the Jialing River, I followed the songs and "hoisting chants" and walked along the riverbank. It turned out to be a group of boatmen pulling towing lines, transporting cement, stone, and equipment from afar.

He, He Wanfa, a "small captain" from Sichuan, is only nineteen years old this year, but he has been safely sailing wooden boats in the turbulent river for three years. Once, when the boat ran aground, he immediately jumped into the icy river, using his shoulders to move the side of the boat and push it past the dangerous shoal. Yao Kaiming, who was crossing the flood, when the rapids pushed the boat onto a reef and the boat was broken, and the flood poured in, he immediately took off his clothes to plug the hole, and he also used his chest to block the flood, saving the wooden boat that was about to sink. Kong Xiangfu, a fifty-six-year-old helmsman, steered a sheepskin raft, swaying through the storms and waves, day and night, delivering explosives and equipment to the construction site, and ferrying people across the valley. Although the river water splashed on his clothes, he always loved to stroke his thick beard and smile, saying: "To build the railway, I feel thirty years younger!"

For several years, it was these people who braved the wind and rain, avoided hidden reefs and dangerous shoals, and opened up shipping routes in the white waves, sending tens of millions of tons of grain, vegetables, and equipment to the front lines of the construction site, supporting the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway!

Workers' Villages

Many workers' villages are scattered along the valleys of the Jialing River. Here, there are clinics, supply stations, sundry stalls, barbershops, cobbler's stands, and green mailboxes of postal agencies and places for banks to handle savings. In the clubhouse in the thatched shed, there are many musical instruments, and the sound of Qinqiang opera can be heard from afar. Every time after work, you can also see people wearing vests printed with the words "Baoji-Chengdu Railway" active on the basketball court, while others hold fishing rods, fishing by the river while listening quietly to the broadcasts from the capital.

In a worker's village near the estuary, I visited some worker families. Although the thatched mud huts they lived in were very crowded, they were kept very tidy and clean, and some walls were even hung with meritorious service certificates. What surprised me most was that many of the children playing in the yard had the same names like "Baocheng", "Fengsha", "Fulu", "Baojian". These children, who have been traveling with their parents on railway construction sites since birth, their parents love to name their children after the railways they built with their own hands. In the past year, hundreds of children have been born on the construction site of the Fourth Bureau and Second Division alone. When I visited the family of worker Wang Chongxin, his wife had just given birth to a boy, the child was red and fat, like a pomegranate flower. I asked him what his name was. Wang Chongxin smiled and said: "I haven't given him a name yet. After thinking about it, it's always related to the meaning of Baoji-Chengdu Railway and Jialing River!..."

    沿着嘉陵江——从宝鸡到成都之四
    本报记者  纪希晨
    几天来，我一直沿着嘉陵江畔旅行。那滔滔的江水，拍打着悬崖，撞击着巨石，涌卷起漩涡，飞溅起浪花，像巨蟒一般，忽而怒吼着穿过陡峭的峡谷，忽而又狂奔过开阔的河源。多少年来，它就这样流过陕、甘、川三省，把来往旅人横阻在江的两岸。我国古代有一个诗人曾这样描写嘉陵江。
    凿石泄奔湍，称古神禹迹，
    夜渲山门店，独宿不安席，
    水性自云静，石中本无声，
    如何两相激，雷转空山惊，
    今天，嘉陵江的激流，虽然同过去一样汹湍咆哮，却已被日夜战斗在江上的筑路工人，制服得更加伏贴了。他们在江上切开了巍峨的高山，修起了许多座雄伟的大桥，让激流改变了旧日的江道。
    改河移山
    这里是甘肃两当县的三度水和李家山。从秦岭南麓奔泻下来的嘉陵江，流到这里，突然被一座横卧在河谷中的石山阻挡起来；然后沿着狭窄的山谷，连绕两个“V”形的大圈。经过这里的宝成铁路，如果按照经常凿洞穿山的办法，必须在四公里的距离内，先后修筑四座大桥梁，四次跨过嘉陵江面，这样，就势必延缓工程的进展。后来，根据苏联专家契契金的建议，决定把两座山拦腰炸开，既可以节省几座桥梁，也可以把工程提前。
    执行这项爆炸任务的冯化南队长，虽然曾是亲手炸毁敌人许多碉堡的工兵连长，可是面对着二百六十三吨炸药的大爆破，心中也不免有些胆怯。
    “只许成功，不许失败；我们要一炮炸开一座山！”在苏联专家指导下，经过一个多月的准备，冯队长在起爆以前，再三向青年突击队长田克会嘱咐。爆破开始，轰的一声，山脚腾起一股浓烟，转眼遮住了半个天，在一阵剧烈的地震中，李家山被劈开了一道宽阔的江道，河流也猛然改变了方向，照直向南奔来。
    站在江边新筑起的长堤似的路基上，冯化南队长指着炸开的四十多公尺宽的豁口，对我说：
    “你看，大禹凿龙门费时好多年，可是，我们只用三秒钟就炸开了一座山！”
    江底的进攻
    筑路员工在征服千百条江河沟渠和十六次横跨嘉陵江的斗争中，以修筑站儿巷十号大桥最为艰难。这座大桥，跨度虽然不长，却是宝成铁路能否提前通车的关键。这里的三号桥墩——全线的最后一个桥墩，在浇灌时突然发生了意外。汹涌的江水，在一座石崖前突然向东猛折，把江底岩层冲刷成一高一低的陡坡；同时，三号桥墩的基础，有一半是探不见底的流沙、滑泥，而另一半，却被倾斜的一块孤石挡住了。要在这种不稳固的基础上架起桥来，就像在沙滩上修高楼那样冒险。因此，必须迅速把流沙、滑泥从江底清除，否则，沉井就无法在激流中放稳。
    “同志们：我们要攻破这最后一关”。吕队长向全体工人动员说。潜水工李文举等马上带着风钻，鱼儿似的钻入湍急的河流里，游泅着摸索在水下打钻，放炮，挖沙。虽然在水底呼吸十分困难，稍一动作头就晕昏起来，可是，他们却一直轮流在水里工作了三十六个小时。清除了礁石，流沙，放下了沉井，并在沉井周围打好了钢管。这时，激流猛然一冲，又把一股泥沙从钢管基础的空隙里冲进来，一下把六个工人埋在沉井里面。当情况十分危险的时候，开挖班长白登科，首先抓住钢绳，从流沙里挣脱出来，而且帮助别人脱离了危险。后来，他们又在沉井里打钢管，用内部压浆排水下沉法，克服了江底的反沙，终于把一座高高的桥墩，在波涛汹涌的江心中竖立起来。我们来到这里的时候，从北边开来的架桥机，正伸着巨臂，像老鹰攫着小鸡似的，将一根根钢梁安装在桥墩上面。
    勇敢的船工
    美丽的徽县谈家庄，被翠绿的青树林，红的石榴花和累累结满枇杷、核桃的果木树，点缀得像一座大花园。青山激流间，不时漂下来一只只木船。当夜色从山脚袭来，嘉陵江上燃起点点灯火的时候，我顺着传来的歌声、“号子”声，沿着江岸走到跟前，原来是一群船工，拉着牵藤，从远方运来了水泥，石料和器材。
    他，来自四川的“小驾长”何万发，今年才十九岁，可是已驾着木船，在波涛汹涌的江水里，安全航行了三年。一次，船搁了滩，他马上跳进流着冰凌的江水里，用肩膀扛动船舷，推船过了险滩。横渡洪水的姚开明，当激流将船冲到暗礁上把船撞破，洪水喷灌进来时，立刻脱下衣服塞住洞口，还用胸脯把洪水阻挡起来，挽救了快要沉没的木船。五十六岁的老舵手孔祥福，不分黑夜白天都驾着羊皮船，飘摇在狂风险浪里，给工地送去炸药、器材，从峡谷渡过往来的人员。尽管江水溅湿了他的衣衫，但他总爱捻着满腮的浓须，微笑着说：“为了修铁路，我像年轻了三十年！”
    几年来，就是这些人，冒着狂风暴雨，躲过了暗礁险滩，在白浪涛天里开辟了航线，把千万吨粮食、蔬菜和器材，送到了工地最前线，支援着宝成铁路的建设！
    工人的村庄
    在嘉陵江的河谷上，散布着许多工人的村庄。这儿有医务所，有供应站，有杂货摊，理发店，补鞋担，还有邮政代办所的绿色信箱和银行办理储蓄的地方。草棚中的俱乐部里，摆了许多乐器，老远都可以听见唱秦腔的声音。每当下班的时候，还可看到穿着印有“宝成铁路”字样的背心的人们，活跃在篮球场上，有的则拿着钓鱼杆，一面在江边钓鱼，一面静听着首都的广播。
    在河口附近的一个工人村里，我访问了一些工人家庭。他们居住的茅草泥棚虽然十分拥挤，但收拾得都很整齐干净，有些墙壁上还悬挂有立功的奖状。最使我惊奇的是在院子里玩耍的孩子们，有许多都叫着“宝成”、“丰沙”、“福路”、“宝建”等相同的名字。这些一生下来就同父母辗转在铁路工地上的孩子们，他们的父母都爱用自己亲手修筑的铁路来命名自己的孩子。一年来，单四局二处工地就诞生了几百个孩子。当我访问工人王重新家庭的时候，他的爱人刚生下一个男孩子，小孩长的又红又胖，好像一朵石榴花一样。我问他叫什么名字，王重新笑了笑说：“我还没有给起下名字，想来想去，反正总离不开宝成路、嘉陵江的意思！……”
