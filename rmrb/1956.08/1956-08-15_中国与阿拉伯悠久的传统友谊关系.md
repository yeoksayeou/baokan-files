The friendly relations between Asian and African countries, especially between China and Arab countries, have seen new development since the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries in April 1955. China and Egypt signed cultural exchange minutes and a trade agreement, exchanged trade delegations, teachers and students. Later, trade agreements were also signed with Syria and Lebanon. On May 16th of this year, Egypt announced its recognition of the People's Republic of China, followed by a joint communique announcing mutual dispatch of ambassadors. On July 3rd, Syria also announced its recognition of the People's Republic of China. On August 10th, China and Syria issued a joint communique announcing that they had decided to exchange ambassadors. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt and Syria not only conforms to the interests of the people of the three countries, but is also beneficial to world peace. It is a concrete manifestation of the Bandung spirit, and is therefore widely welcomed by the people of Asian and African countries. This is a milestone in the history of political, economic and cultural relations between the Chinese people and the people of Arab countries.

China and Arab countries are thousands of miles apart, but from a very early age, political and economic relations existed even under very difficult traffic conditions. According to the Arab historians and geographers Masudi, as early as the fifth century, Chinese ships frequently sailed to Oman, Siraf, the coast of the Persian Gulf, the coast of Bahrain, Obbla, Basra and other places. Ships from these areas also often came to China. After the Great Food Kingdom (Arabia) sent envoys to China in the second year of Yonghui in the Tang Dynasty (651 AD), exchanges between China and Great Food became increasingly frequent. According to Chinese historical records, in the second year of Yonghui in the Tang Dynasty (651 AD), the King of Great Food, Tan Mi Mo Mo Ni, sent an envoy, "saying that the Great Food clan has been a country for thirty-four years, and has gone through three masters." (Tang Shu Da Shi Zhuan, Ce Fu Yuan Gui Volume 970) Persians called Arabs "Da Shi," and the "King of Da Shi" here refers to Uthman (reigned 644-656), the third successor to the Prophet Muhammad.

From the second year of Tang Yonghui to the fourteenth year of Tang Zhenyuan (651-798), Great Food sent envoys a total of thirty times in one hundred and forty-seven years.

Muawiyah established the Umayyad Dynasty in Damascus, Syria. The color was white, and Chinese historical books called it the White-Clad Great Food. It lasted for fourteen dynasties and ninety years (661-750) before it was destroyed by the Abbasid Dynasty.

Abul Abbas (translated as Abu Luo Ba in the Tang Shu) established the Abbasid Dynasty in Baghdad, Iraq. The color was black, and Chinese historical books called it the Black-Clad Great Food. It lasted for thirty-seven dynasties and five hundred and nine years (750-1258) before it was destroyed by the Mongol Hulagu.

Before the sixth year of Tianbao (747), the envoys were only called Great Food envoys without distinction, and all referred to envoys of the White-Clad Great Food. After the eleventh year of Tianbao (752), the envoys were called Black-Clad Great Food envoys to show the change of dynasties. This is a detailed record in Chinese history.

In the first year of Shangyuan (760), "eighteen people, including the White-Clad envoy and the Po Ye envoy, were entertained at the Yan Ying Hall." In the seventh year of Dali (772), "Great Food sent envoys to pay tribute." One of these records vaguely mentions "Great Food," while the other adds the adjective "White-Clad." Both refer to the Umayyad Dynasty of Spain. This is because Abd al-Rahman, a descendant of the Syrian Umayyad Dynasty, fled to Spain and rebuilt the Umayyad Dynasty in Cordoba, which lasted for twenty-four dynasties and two hundred and seventy-five years (756-1031). Although they were far away in Spain, they sent envoys to China twice, and the first envoy had as many as eighteen people, which shows how much they valued China's friendship.

In the fourth year of the Song Qiande (966), taking advantage of the monk Xingqin's travels to the Western Regions, the Song Dynasty emperor entrusted him to send a letter to the Caliph of the Black-Clad Great Food to express his greetings.

In the first year of Song Kaibao (968), Great Food sent envoys to China. From the first year of Kaibao to the first year of Jiayou (968-1056), there were as many as seventeen visits in eighty-nine years. Great Food merchants also presented gifts to the Chinese emperor.

After the Mongols conquered China and destroyed the Abbasid Dynasty, transportation between China and Arab countries became more convenient, and exchanges between the Chinese and Arab peoples became more frequent. During the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He, a Hui Muslim from Yunnan, was sent to the West seven times, visiting Southeast Asia and the Middle East Arab countries. Envoys from Arab countries also came to China many times. Most noteworthy were the two missions from Egypt: one during the Yongle period (around 1414) and the other in the sixth year of Zhengtong (1441). The then Egyptian king was Sultan al-Ashraf of the Mamluk Dynasty (Slave Dynasty 1250-1517).

After colonialism expanded its power into Asia and Africa, exchanges between China and Arab countries were hindered. In 1949, the Chinese people's revolution won victory, and the Chinese people took control of their own destiny. After the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, relations between Arab countries and China became closer, as evidenced by the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt and Syria.

The close economic ties between China and Arab countries can be demonstrated by the following facts. For eight hundred years, from the beginning of the eighth century to the end of the fifteenth century, before Europeans came to the East, international trade around the world was controlled by the Arabs. In the late eighth century, after the Abbasid Dynasty established its capital in Baghdad, Arab international trade entered its golden age.

According to Chinese historical records, Arab merchants left their footprints everywhere in Southeast Asian countries. Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Mingzhou, and Hangzhou in China were all foreign trade ports during the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Customs offices were set up in each port to collect tariffs and manage foreign trade. In that era, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Yangzhou all had Arab expatriate communities. From this, one can imagine the prosperity of trade between China and Great Food.

At that time, Arab merchants transported ivory, rhinoceros horns, pearls, gemstones, agate, various spices, and medicinal materials to China in exchange for Chinese silk, porcelain, tea, gold, silver, and coins, which they then transported to the West to seek huge profits. According to statistics on foreign trade in the tenth year of Xining in the Song Dynasty (1077), the three customs offices of Guangzhou, Mingzhou, and Hangzhou purchased as much as 354,449 catties of frankincense. In the eighth century, there was a market in Baghdad dedicated to selling Chinese porcelain (Ya'qubi's Geography). This development of international trade not only revitalized the economic life of various countries to a certain extent, but also promoted friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples.

Many medicinal materials imported from Arab countries have been propagated on Chinese soil. Many Chinese names for spices and jewels are transliterations or semantic translations of Arabic names. For example, "乳香 (rǔxiāng)" (frankincense) is a semantic translation of lubān. "没药 (mòyào)" (myrrh) and "末药 (mòyào)" are transliterations of murr, which originally means "bitter." "胡芦巴 (húlúbā)" (fenugreek) is a transliteration of hulbah (a legume seed, shaped like a bean but with a bitter taste, hence the name bitter bean). "押不卢 (yābùlú)" is a transliteration of yabrūh, the name of the mandrake root. "鸦鹘 (yāhú)" and "亚姑 (yàgū)" are transliterations of yā-qū (ruby). "祖母绿 (zǔmǔlǜ)" and "助木剌 (zhùmùlà)" are transliterations of (zummurrud) emerald. "绿甘 (lǜgān)" is a transliteration of rukhām (marble or white jade).

The names of Chinese goods imported into Arab countries have also taken root in the Arabic language. For example, shāi (tea) is the most commonly used noun. Arabs call China al-Sin (Qin), so they call porcelain sini (Chinese, Chinese man) and trays siniyyah (Chinese, Chinese woman). Arabic dictionaries also preserve nouns such as junk (ship), dārsini (Chinese medicine, referring to cinnamon), khār sini (zinc), and so on.

We can also see the friendly relationship between China and Arab countries from a linguistic perspective. Arabs use porcelain pots, porcelain cups, and trays for tea every day. Whether men, women, old, or young, they have to say or hear the nouns shāi, sini, siniyyah, etc., every day. They feel very cordial when they mention China or meet Chinese people.

In the Middle Ages, Arabs not only dominated international trade in Asia, Africa, and Europe, but were also disseminators of world culture. They not only preserved the brilliant ancient Greek culture, but also absorbed the cultures of Egypt, Syria, Persia, India, and China, promoted and developed them, and then spread them to various countries in the East and West. There are many reasons for the European Renaissance, but the introduction of Arab culture is one of the important reasons.

The Arabs transmitted Chinese papermaking, printing, and the compass to the West, and introduced Islam, the Arabic language, astronomy, and medicine to China.

According to the Persian writer Nuruddin, during the Umayyad Dynasty (White-Clad Great Food 661-750), the descendants of Hassan and Hussein, grandsons of the Prophet Muhammad, were persecuted by the White-Clad Great Food and the Black-Clad Great Food, and therefore fled to the bank of a river on the Chinese border (possibly the Tarim River). They expressed to the Chinese emperor their willingness to become Chinese subjects, and the Chinese emperor accepted their request.

In the Middle Ages, there were two routes of transportation between China and Central and Western Asia: land and sea. The introduction of Islam, in addition to the northwestern land route mentioned above, also had the maritime route of the South Seas. The remnants of the Guangta Mosque in Guangzhou and the Qingjing Mosque in Quanzhou are both buildings from the Tang and Song dynasties. The Arabic inscriptions recently unearthed in Quanzhou prove that there were already a large number of Muslims there during the Song Dynasty.

At that time, Muslims had the freedom to believe in religion and perform religious ceremonies without interference from anyone. The Arab Sulaiman has the following record:

"Guangfu (Guangzhou) is a gathering place for merchants. The Chinese emperor selects one Muslim to handle lawsuits for Muslims who come to trade there. Every time on Fridays and festivals, he leads the public in prayers, preaches doctrines, and prays to Allah for the 'Sultan' (translated as king) of the Islamic countries. The merchants of Iraq all submit to his judgment because he is just, fair, and judges according to religious teachings."

According to Ibn Battuta, in addition to the judge in charge of litigation, there was also a cleric in charge of religious affairs, which is the "摄思廉 (Shè sī lián)" (Shaikh al-Islam, Islamic elder) mentioned in the Yuan Wu Jian Qingjing Temple Record.

Chinese Islam has always been respected by the Chinese government and the Chinese people for more than a thousand years. Only under the Qing Dynasty were Muslims massacred, and during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they were discriminated against and persecuted. The mosque outside Chaoyangmen in Beijing and the mosque in Mujiazhuangzi in Tianjin were also demolished a year before liberation. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China explicitly stipulates that citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of religious belief. This is a concrete manifestation of the Chinese people's belief in freedom throughout the ages.

The Arabic language, along with Islam, was introduced into China and was once the common language among Muslims during the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Today, the Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minorities in the Northwest still use Arabic letters to spell their languages. This script is on our commonly used RMB banknotes. Every Chinese person comes into contact with these Arabic letters every day. In almost every mosque across the country, people are learning the Arabic text of doctrines and precepts. Every Friday, the Ahong (Imam) recites the "虎土白 (Hǔ tǔ bái)" (Khutbah, sermon) in Arabic. Believers are still reciting the Arabic version of the Quran. Dozens of male and female students in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University are learning this beautiful international language. The China Islamic Institute and the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade also teach this language.

Arabic astronomy, calendar calculation, and astronomical instruments were introduced into China during the Yuan Dynasty and played a certain role in the evolution of Chinese astronomy and calendar calculation. The Huihui (Muslim) calendar was used for more than four hundred years during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

Today, Chinese children learn ten Arabic numerals in kindergarten. Chinese men and women, young and old, especially those engaged in mathematics, physics, chemistry, finance, banking, and accounting, write countless Arabic numerals every day. Therefore, the Chinese people also feel very cordial when mentioning Arab countries and Arab peoples.

Arabic medicine has also made great contributions to China. Arabs not only imported many medicinal materials, but also imported Arabic medicine.

Medicinal materials imported from Arab countries, such as frankincense, myrrh, styrax, cloves, ambergris, benzoin, borax, rhinoceros horn, castor (sea dog kidney), fenugreek, etc., have been widely adopted by the Chinese medical community. The Yuan Secretariat's "Records of Huihui Books" contains "忒毕医经 (Tè bì yī jīng)" ("Tibbi Medicine Classic"). "忒毕 (Tè bì)" is a transliteration of the Arabic word tibb, meaning medicine. This may be Avicenna's "Canon of Medicine." The Beijing Library still houses a manuscript of "Huihui Prescriptions," but unfortunately it is incomplete.

During the Yuan Dynasty, the "广惠司 (Guǎng huì sī)" (Guanghui Department) was established under the Imperial Hospital, with a rank of Zheng Sanpin (third rank), in charge of repairing and manufacturing Huihui medicines and preparing formulas for imperial use, to treat the guards and the poor in the capital. (Yuan Shi Bai Guan Zhi)

Arabic medicine was also popularized among the people. Arab doctors were particularly famous for their surgery. The Yuan Tao Zongyi's "辍耕录 (Chuò gēng lù)" (Records While Resting from Plowing) has the following record, which can be used as proof:

"Ren Zizhao said: 'When I lived in the capital in the past, a neighbor's child suffered from unbearable headaches. There was a Huihui medical officer who used a knife to cut open his forehead and took out a small crab, as hard as a stone, still able to move, and died shortly after. The pain also stopped quickly. I managed to obtain the crab and still keep it today.' Xia Xuemao said: 'I once saw a passerby in Pingjiang Chenmen with a distended horse's belly, falling to the ground. A passing old Huihui saw this, cut a small piece from his left leg, I don't know what it was. The horse immediately rode away.'"

The things that these two "Huihui medical officers" and "old Huihui" cut out of people's foreheads and horse's legs were probably tumors. Tumors are things that are as hard as crabs, which are called Saratan in Arabic medicine, meaning crab, translated into the Western word Cancer, which also means "crab."

Arabs made significant contributions to chemistry. They invented the distillation method. The Chinese method of distilling wine may have been learned directly from the Arabs, or it may have been indirectly introduced by Westerners. The Qing Zhao Xue Min's "本草纲目拾遗 (Běncǎo Gāngmù Shíyí)" (Compendium of Materia Medica Supplement) says:

"Anything with substance can be extracted for dew. Dew is the essence of matter. The method originated in the Atlantic Ocean and was introduced to China. Large items use a steamer, and small items use a pot, both can be used for steam extraction. The dew is the gas water of the steamed item. Although items have various colors, the dew extracted is always white, and can only be distinguished by gas, not by color."

We only know that there are abridged Chinese translations of "One Thousand and One Nights," but we don't know that as early as the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty (late 17th century), Liu Zhi, a Hui scholar in Nanjing, had already written three books in Chinese, "天方性理 (Tiānfāng Xìnglǐ)" (Islamic Philosophy), "天方礼典 (Tiānfāng Lǐdiǎn)" (Islamic Rituals), and "天方至圣实录 (Tiānfāng Zhìshèng Shílù)" (The True Record of the Islamic Prophet), to introduce Arabic philosophy, Islamic doctrines, and the history of the Prophet Muhammad. In the sixteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1890), Ma Anli, a Hui scholar in Yunnan, translated the beautiful praise poem (Qasida al-Burda) by the famous Egyptian poet Busiri (1212-1296) into Chinese in the style of the "Book of Songs" and published it with the original Arabic poem in Chengdu, calling it "天方诗经 (Tiānfāng Shījīng)" (Islamic Book of Songs).

In addition to the papermaking, printing, and compass mentioned above, the Arabs learned Chinese painting, brocade weaving, and porcelain manufacturing from Chinese culture. According to Du Huan, who lived in the Great Food Kingdom for several years in the mid-7th century, Chinese artists in Great Food included Fan Shu and Liu Ci from Jingzhao, who taught Chinese painting, and Le Pei and Lü Li from Hedong, who taught weaving methods. (Du You Tongdian Volume 193)

The part of the great work "Canon of Medicine" by the Arab physician Avicenna that discusses pulse diagnosis may have been introduced to Arabia from China via Persia.

Judging from the large number of porcelain pieces unearthed in the ancient city of Fustat in Cairo, Egypt, the Egyptians had been extensively imitating Chinese porcelain as early as the Fatimid Dynasty (969-1171, i.e., the second year of Song Kaibao to the seventh year of Qiandao).

Chinese shadow puppetry was introduced to Egypt in the 12th century through the Mongols and Turks and was loved by the Egyptian people, especially children. Before the introduction of movies to Egypt, shadow puppetry was very popular in Egypt and other Arab countries, and everyone loved to watch folk tales performed by "Qaraquz." After the invention of movies, shadow puppetry is still popular, especially in the Egyptian countryside. Now that the Egyptian people can see Chinese Peking Opera and movies, they are even more excited.

During my studies in Egypt, I translated Confucius' "Analects" into Arabic. This classic work has been valued by the academic community. Now, progressive writers in Syria have translated Chairman Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On New Democracy," and "On Practice" into Arabic. Progressive writers in Egypt have recently translated Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and some of Lu Xun's works. Our "Land Reform Law" also has an Arabic translation.

China and Arab countries have had a long history of traditional friendship. Since colonialism invaded Eastern countries, we have also had common experiences. Now, China has been liberated, and the Chinese people have stood up. We express sympathy and support for the national liberation movements of the people of Eastern countries, especially the people of Arab countries, and their just struggle to safeguard independence and sovereignty. We are willing to help and cooperate with their economic and cultural construction. Our unwavering policy is to strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress.

    中国与阿拉伯悠久的传统友谊关系
    马坚
    自1955年4月亚非国家万隆会议以来，亚非各国间，特别是中国与阿拉伯各国间的友谊关系获得了新的发展。中国与埃及，签订了文化会谈纪要、贸易协定，并且与埃及互派贸易代表团，交换教师和留学生。后来又与叙利亚和黎巴嫩签订了贸易协定。今年五月十六日，埃及宣布承认中华人民共和国，接着中埃两国发表联合公报，宣布双方互派大使。七月三日，叙利亚也宣布承认中华人民共和国。八月十日，中叙两国发表联合公报，已经决定互派大使。中国与埃、叙的建交不仅符合三国人民的利益，对于世界的持久和平也是有利的，这是万隆精神的具体表现，所以受到亚非各国人民的普遍欢迎。这是中国人民与阿拉伯各国人民政治、经济、文化关系史上的里程碑。
    中国与阿拉伯国家，相距数万里，但是很早以前，在交通十分困难的情况下，就已发生政治上和经济上的关系。据阿拉伯的历史学家和地理学家麦斯欧迭的记载，远在五世纪的时候，中国船只就经常航行到俄曼、西拉甫、波斯湾海岸、巴哈林海岸、俄卜莱、巴索拉等地。这些地区的船只也常到中国来。唐永徽二年（651年）大食国遣使来中国以后，中国与大食的往来逐渐频繁起来。据中国史书的记载，唐永徽二年（651年），大食王啖密莫末腻派遣使者来，“自言大食氏有国三十四年，历三主矣。”（唐书大食传，册府元龟卷970）波斯人称阿拉伯人为“大食”，这里的“大食王”是指穆罕默德圣人的第三位继位者欧思曼（644—656年在位）。
    自唐永徽二年到唐贞元十四年（651—798年），一百四十七年间，大食共派遣使节三十次。
    穆尔威叶建立伍麦叶王朝于叙利亚的大马士革，色尚白，中国史书上叫做白衣大食，传十四朝，历九十年（661—750年），亡于阿拔斯王朝。
    艾卜勒·阿拔斯（唐书译为阿蒲罗拔）建立阿拔斯王朝于伊拉克的巴格达，色尚黑，中国史书上叫做黑衣大食，传三十七朝，历五百零九年（750—1258年），亡于蒙古人旭烈兀（Hulagu）。
    天宝六年（747年）以前的使者只称大食使者，不加区别，都是指白衣大食的使者。自天宝十一年（752年）以后的使者都称黑衣大食使者，以示朝代的更替，这是中国历史细致的记载。
    上元元年（760年）“宴白衣使婆谒使等十八人于延英殿会”。大历七年（772年）“大食遣使朝贡”。这两条记载，一条浑云“大食”，一条加“白衣”的形容词，所指的都是西班牙的伍麦叶王朝。因为叙利亚伍麦叶王朝的遗族阿卜杜·赖哈曼曾逃到西班牙，重建伍麦叶王朝于哥尔多华，传二十四朝，历二百七十五年（756—1031年）。他们虽远在西班牙，还两次派遣使节到中国来，而第一次的使节有十八人之多，足见他们是怎样重视中国的友谊。
    宋乾德四年（966年）因僧人行勤游西域之便，宋朝皇帝托他带信给黑衣大食的哈里发，向他致意。
    宋开宝元年（968年）大食遣使来中国。自开宝元年到嘉祐元年（968—1056年）八十九年间，共达十七次之多。大食商人也有向中国皇帝献礼的。
    自蒙古人征服中国和消灭阿拔斯王朝后，中国与阿拉伯各国间的交通愈加便利，中国人民与阿拉伯各国人民间的往来更加频繁。明朝时云南回民郑和七次奉使西洋，曾到东南亚和中近东阿拉伯各国，阿拉伯各国的使臣也曾屡次到中国。最值得注意的是埃及的两次遣使。一是在永乐中（1414年前后），二是在正统六年（1441年）。当时埃及国王是麦姆鲁克朝（奴隶王朝1250—1517）的素鲁檀（国王）阿失剌福。
    自殖民主义向亚非两洲扩张势力后，中国与阿拉伯各国之间的往来遭到妨碍。1949年中国人民革命胜利，中国人民掌握了自己的命运。亚非各国万隆会议后，阿拉伯各国与中国的关系更形密切，中国与埃、叙的建交就是一个明证。
    中国与阿拉伯各国的经济联系的紧密，可由下面这些事实加以证明。自八世纪初到十五世纪末，欧洲人到东方来之前，八百年间，全世界的国际贸易都由阿拉伯人操纵。到八世纪末，阿拔斯王朝定都于巴格达之后，阿拉伯人的国际贸易进入全盛时代。
    据中国史书的记载，东南亚各国到处有阿拉伯商人的足迹，中国的广州、泉州、明州、杭州，在唐、宋、元时代都是外国贸易港，各置市舶司以征关税，并管理对外贸易。在那个时代，广州、泉州、扬州都有阿拉伯侨民的居住区。由此可以想见当时中国和大食国间贸易之盛。
    当时阿拉伯商人把象牙、犀角、真珠、宝石、玛瑙、各种香料和药材贩运到中国来换取中国的丝绸、磁器、茶叶、金银和钱币，又贩运到西方去，以谋取厚利。据宋神宗熙宁十年（1077年）的外国贸易统计，广州、明州、杭州三州市舶司所收购的乳香达354，449斤之多。八世纪时，巴格达城里有专卖中国磁器的市场（叶孤比地方志）。这种国际贸易的发展，不仅在一定程度上活跃了各国的经济生活，也促进了中国人民与阿拉伯人民之间的友谊。
    阿拉伯人输入中国的许多药材已在中国的土地上繁殖起来。许多香料和珠宝的中国名称是阿拉伯名称的译音或者译义。例如，“乳香”是译lubān的义。“没药”和“末药”是译murr的音，本义是“苦的”。“胡芦巴”是hulbah的译音（这是一种豆科植物的种子，形似豆而味苦，故称苦豆）。“押不卢”是译yabrūh的音，是曼陀罗根的名称。“鸦鹘”和“亚姑”是译yā—qū（红宝石）的音。“祖母绿”和“助木剌”是译（zummurrud）翡翠的音。“绿甘”是译rukhām（大理石或汉白玉）的音。
    输入阿拉伯各国的中国货物的名称也在阿拉伯语文里生了根，如shāi（茶叶）就是最常用的名词。阿拉伯人称中国为al—Sin（秦），故称磁器为sini（中国的、中国男人），称托盘为siniyyah（中国的、中国女人）。阿拉伯文字典里还保存着junk（船）、dārsini（中国药，指桂皮）、khār sini（锌）等等名词。
    我们从语言学上也可以看到中国与阿拉伯国家之间的友谊关系。阿拉伯人每天使用磁壶、磁杯和托盘做茶具，无论男女老幼，天天都要说到或者听到shāi、sini、siniyyah等等名词，他们提到中国或者遇见中国人是十分亲切的。
    在中古时期，阿拉伯人不仅执亚、非、欧三洲国际贸易的牛耳，而且是世界文化的传播者。他们不仅保全了古代希腊灿烂光明的文化，而且吸收了埃及、叙利亚、波斯、印度、中国的文化，而加以发扬光大，然后传播到东西各国。欧洲文艺复兴的原因固然很多，但是阿拉伯文化的传入是重要原因之一。
    阿拉伯人把中国的造纸术、印刷术、指南针传到西方去，把伊斯兰教、阿拉伯文、天文学、医药等传入中国。
    据波斯著作家努尔丁的记载，伍麦叶王朝（白衣大食661—750年）时代，穆罕默德圣人的外孙哈桑和侯赛尼的后裔先后遭受白衣大食和黑衣大食的迫害，因而逃避到中国边境某条河的河畔（可能是塔里木河）。他们向中国皇帝表示愿意做中国的臣民，中国皇帝接受了他们的请求。
    在中古时期，中国与中亚和西亚的交通，有海陆两路。伊斯兰教的传入，除上面所说西北的陆路外，还有南洋的海道。现在广州的光塔、泉州的清净寺遗址，都是唐宋时代的建筑物。最近在泉州出土的阿拉伯文石刻，可以证明宋朝时候那里已经有大量的伊斯兰教徒了。
    当时伊斯兰教徒有信仰宗教和举行宗教仪式的自由，不受任何人的干涉。阿拉伯人苏莱曼有下面的记载：
    “广府（广州）是买卖人的汇集处，中国皇帝简选伊斯兰教徒一人，办理前往该处经商的伊斯兰教徒的诉讼，每当聚礼日和节日，就由他率领大众做礼拜，宣讲教义，并为伊斯兰教国的‘素勒丹’（译云国王）向安拉祈祷。伊拉克的商人们都服从他的裁判，因为他是公正廉明，依照教典而裁判的。”
    据伊本·白图泰的记载，除管理诉讼的裁判官外，还有管理教务的教长，这就是元吴鉴清净寺记所提及的“摄思廉”（Shaikh I slām，伊斯兰教长老）。
    中国的伊斯兰教千多年来一贯受到中国政府和中国人民的尊重，只有在清朝统治之下伊斯兰教徒遭到了屠杀，在国民党反动统治时期遭到了歧视和迫害，北京朝阳门外的清真寺和天津穆家庄子的清真寺也在解放前一年被拆毁了。中华人民共和国宪法以明文规定中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由。这是历代中国人民对于信仰自由的具体表现。
    阿拉伯语文随着伊斯兰教传入中国，曾经是唐、宋、元时代伊斯兰教徒间通用的语文。现在西北的维吾尔、哈萨克等少数民族还用阿拉伯字母拼写他们的语言，我国通用的人民币上就有这种文字。每个中国人天天都要跟这些阿拉伯字母接触。全国各地的清真寺里差不多都有人在学习阿拉伯文本的教义和教律。每星期五，阿訇都用阿拉伯文宣读“虎土白”（讲演）。教徒们还在诵读阿拉伯文的古兰经。北京大学东方语言系有几十名男女学生在学习这种优美的国际语文，中国伊斯兰教经学院和北京对外贸易学院也教这种语文。
    阿拉伯的天文历算和天文仪器，在元朝时候传入中国，对于中国的天文历算的演进起了一定的作用。回回历在元、明、清三朝，沿用四百余年。
    现在，中国的儿童们在幼儿园里就要学会十个阿拉伯数码。中国的男女老幼，特别是从事于数学、物理学、化学、财政、金融和会计工作的人们，每天不知道要写多少阿拉伯数码。因此，中国人民在提及阿拉伯国家和阿拉伯人民的时候，也感到很亲切。
    阿拉伯医药对于中国的贡献也是很大的。阿拉伯人不仅输入许多药材，而且输入阿拉伯的医学。
    阿拉伯人输入中国的药材，如乳香、没药、木香、丁香、龙涎香、安息香、硼砂、犀角、腽肭脐（海狗肾）、胡芦巴等，都被中国医药界广泛采用。元秘书监志“回回书籍”内有“忒毕医经”。“忒毕”是阿拉伯字tibb的译音，意义是医学。这可能是阿维森纳的“医典”。现在北京图书馆还收藏着“回回药方”的手抄本，可惜已残缺不全了。
    元朝时候在太医院下设“广惠司，秩正三品，掌修制御用回回药物及和剂，以疗诸宿卫士及在京孤寒者”。（元史百官志）
    阿拉伯医学也普及于民间。阿拉伯医生的外科手术特别著名，元陶宗仪辍耕录有下面的纪载，可以为证：
    “任子昭云：‘向寓都下时，邻家儿患头疼，不可忍，有回回医官，用刀割开额上，取一小蟹，坚硬如石，尚能活动，顷焉方死，疼亦遄止。当求得蟹，至今藏之。’夏雪蓑云：‘尝于平江阊门见过客马腹膨胀，倒地。店中偶有老回回见之，于左腿内割取小块出，不知何物也。其马随即骑而去。’”
    这两位“回回医官”和“老回回”从人额上和马腿上割取出来的东西大概是毒瘤。毒瘤是像螃蟹样坚硬如石的东西，阿拉伯医学上把它叫做Saratān，意为螃蟹，译成西方文字的Cancer，也是“螃蟹”的意思。
    阿拉伯人对于化学曾有重大的贡献，他们发明蒸溜法，中国蒸酒的方法可能是直接从阿拉伯人学来的，也可能是由西洋人间接传入的。清赵学敏本草纲目拾遗说：
    “凡物之有质者，皆可取露，露乃物质之精华，其法始于大西洋，传入中国。大则用甑，小则用壶，皆可蒸取，其露即所蒸物之气水。物虽有五色不齐，其所取之露无不白，只以气别，不能以色别也。”
    我们只知道天方夜谭有汉文的节译本，却不知道远在清朝康熙时代（十七世纪末叶）南京的回族学者刘智早已用汉文著“天方性理”、“天方礼典”和“天方至圣实录”三书，以介绍阿拉伯哲学、伊斯兰教教典和穆罕默德圣人的历史了。清朝光绪十六年（1890年），云南的回族学者马安礼曾把埃及著名的大诗人蒲绥里（1212—1296）的优美的颂赞诗，（Qasidta al—Burda）用诗经的体裁译成汉文，与阿拉伯原诗刊行于成都，叫做“天方诗经”。
    中国文化对于阿拉伯文化的影响，除上面说过的造纸术、印刷术、指南针外，阿拉伯人曾学习中国的绘画、织锦和磁器制造。据七世纪中叶曾旅居大食国若干年的杜环记载，中国的艺术家在大食的有京兆人樊淑和刘泚，传授中国绘画，河东人乐阫和吕礼，传授织络的方法。（杜佑通典卷193）
    阿拉伯医学家阿维森纳的伟大著作“医典”内论切脉的部分，可能是从中国经波斯而传入阿拉伯的。
    据埃及开罗古城“符斯塔特”出土的古物中大批的磁器来看，远在法特米王朝（969—1171年，即宋开宝二年到乾道七年）时代，埃及人就大量地仿造中国磁器了。
    中国的皮影子戏，通过蒙古人和土耳其人，于十二世纪时传入埃及，受到埃及人民，特别是小朋友们的热爱。在电影传入埃及之前，皮影子戏在埃及和其他阿拉伯国家十分流行，大家都爱看“盖拉古兹”里演出的民间故事。发明电影以后，皮影子戏仍然受欢迎，特别是在埃及的农村里，现在埃及人民能看到中国的京戏和电影，他们更加兴奋了。
    我在埃及求学的期间，曾将孔子的论语译成阿拉伯文。这部古典著作受到学术界的重视。现在，叙利亚的进步作家已将毛泽东主席的“论人民民主专政”、“新民主主义论”和“实践论”等著作译成阿拉伯文，埃及的进步作家最近又翻译了毛泽东主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”和鲁迅的部分著作，我国的“土地改革法”也有了阿拉伯文的译本。
    中国与阿拉伯各国之间曾有过悠久的传统友谊关系。自殖民主义侵略东方各国以来，我们又曾有过共同的遭遇。现在，中国已经获得了解放，中国人民已经站起来了。我们对于东方各国人民，特别是阿拉伯各国人民的民族解放运动，和维护独立与主权的正义斗争，表示同情和支持；对于他们的经济建设和文化建设，愿意帮助和合作。我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。
