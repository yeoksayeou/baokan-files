The Kingdom of Laos is a country in the Indochinese Peninsula rich in resources and with a long-standing culture. Its terrain is very complex, with plateaus, mountains, vast plains, and dense jungles. The Laotian Plateau ranges in height from over 2,400 meters to 600 meters and is known as the "Roof of Indochina." Mountains and plateaus account for about 80% of the country's land area. Rain and fog shroud the mountain gorges, with forests following one after another. The country is divided into three parts: Upper Laos, Central Laos, and Lower Laos. The climate is subtropical, making it easy to grow crops and raise livestock.

Most of the Laotian people are farmers. The vast plains of the Mekong River basin are fertile for rice. In the 1953-1954 fiscal year, over 660,000 hectares were planted with rice, producing 620,000 tons of rice. Coffee and tobacco are important agricultural exports of Laos, with an annual production of about 1,500 tons and 600 tons respectively. Cotton is produced in the Hua Phan Plateau in the northeast. Animal husbandry is relatively developed in the Bolaven Plateau in the south, producing elephants, cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, etc. There are also many hunting products, with a large number of animal skins exported each year. Laos is rich in forest products. The teak produced in the Mekong River basin is hard and most suitable for shipbuilding materials. Rosewood can be used to make exquisite wooden objects. The Savannakhet province in the south is the largest center of timber production, with a large mechanical sawmill. Timber is mostly exported to Saigon and Thailand. There are hundreds of kinds of bamboo, the best of which is called "Phuak Bamboo," which has long been famous in our country. The purple gum (shellac) produced in the Hua Phan Plateau is of good quality and has a wide range of uses. In addition, there are also special products such as rosewood and benzoin and cardamom. Laos has abundant reserves of minerals such as tin, iron, gold, platinum, silver, antimony, coal, manganese, lead, and gemstones, but very little has been mined. Before the war, there were two large-scale tin mines, exporting about 1,800 tons of tin ore annually. After the war, only one tin mine resumed production, producing 560 tons of tin in 1953.

Freshwater fisheries are well developed in the Mekong River and its tributaries and many pools and swamps. Vientiane and Luang Prabang along the Mekong River are the two major fishery centers.

The Mekong River runs through Laos. Due to the many gorges and rapid water flow, navigation is difficult, but it has abundant water power, which can be used for power generation in the future. The upper reaches from Vientiane to Suwannaphum are navigable by small steamers all year round. Below Suwannaphum, there are three major rapids on the river, so steamers cannot travel directly from Saigon to Vientiane. Land transportation is very difficult because deep valleys and high mountains overlap each other. The length of the highway is about 3,000 kilometers. Among them, a major highway runs from Luang Prabang through Vientiane, Thakhek, and Savannakhet, and can reach Cambodia and Saigon in southern Vietnam. Laos is also connected to the coastal areas of Yi'an, Dong Hoi, and Guangzhi in eastern Vietnam by highways. Crossing the Mekong River from Vientiane, one can reach the Gulf of Siam via the railway in Thailand.

Trade between Laos and Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand is very frequent. Some Laotian products are sold as far away as the Philippines, Europe, and the Americas. Laotian exports include various precious forest products, tin ore, coffee, tobacco, elephants, ivory, cattle, etc.; imports include salt, cloth, and industrial manufactured goods.

Like Cambodia, Burma, and Ceylon, Laos is also a Buddhist country in Southeast Asia, but it is also influenced by Brahmanism; in addition, some people believe in Christianity and Chinese Taoism. Ancient Laotian culture was very developed. Buddhism played a major role in its cultural development. In 1350, King Fan Gan hired eminent monks to widely spread Buddhism. During the reign of King Siddhattha, the capital was moved to Vientiane, where castles and temples were built, and culture flourished. Religious architecture constitutes the center of art. The temples are exquisitely decorated and colorful. Pagodas are one of the main components of urban architecture in Laos. The exquisite pagodas and reliefs of Vientiane, as well as the magnificent palaces and halls of Luang Prabang, are the cultural treasures of Laos and the crystallization of the hard work of the Laotian people.

The Laotian script is derived from Pali, and the language is monosyllabic. Most of the existing religious literary works are manuscripts. Laotian poetry has its own style, consisting of nine to twelve lines. The Laotian people are very fond of music. Dance has been influenced by India. Many beautiful folk songs praising love are circulated among the Laotian people. There are many sacrifices every year, which are grand ceremonies for folk gods and cultural and recreational gatherings to celebrate the fruits of labor. Among them are the "Water Pouring Festival," "Plowing Festival," and "Harvest Festival," etc., and the "Buddha Festival" held in June is the grandest sacrifice of the year.

Due to the long-term rule of colonialists in the past, modern education in Laos is still underdeveloped. There are about 280 schools with about 16,000 students. There are not many middle schools, and institutions of higher learning are yet to be established.

Since gaining independence, the Laotian people have begun to improve their economic and cultural situation. Prime Minister Phouma announced in the National Assembly on February 28 this year that the government is studying a five-year plan. The purpose of this plan is to repair the road system and improve navigable waterways, develop agriculture and animal husbandry, and explore and develop underground resources. Now, the Kingdom of Laos has announced the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality, and the Vientiane talks have also reached an agreement towards national peace and unification. The domestic and international situations are conducive to the construction of Laos. Therefore, the recovery and prosperity of Laos's economy, and the development and improvement of its culture can be expected in the future. (Attached picture)

    老挝王国的经济和文化
    陈玉龙
    老挝王国是中印半岛上的一个物产丰富和文化悠久的国家。它的地形结构很复杂。境内有高原，有山岳，有广漠的平原，也有茂密的丛林。老挝高原的高度自二千四百余公尺至六百公尺不等，有“印度支那屋脊”之称。山地和高原约占全国土地面积80％。山峡中雨雾迷蒙，丛林相继。全国分为上寮、中寮和下寮三个部分。气候属亚热带，农作物和牲畜成长颇易。
    老挝人民大部务农。湄公河流域的大平原盛产大米。1953—1954年度种稻六十六万余公顷，产米六十二万吨。咖啡和烟叶是老挝重要的出口农产品，前者年产约1，500吨，后者约600吨。东北部的华班高原，出产棉花。南部的波罗芬高原，畜牧业比较发达，产象、牛、马、羊、猪等。狩猎产品也多，每年有大量兽皮出口。老挝的林产十分丰富。湄公河流域出产的柚木质地坚硬，最宜于作造船材料。红木可制精致木器。南部的沙湾拿吉省，是木材生产的最大中心，设有很大的机械锯木厂。木材多向西贡及泰国方面输出。竹有百数十种，最佳者叫“濮竹”，很早就闻名我国。华班高原出产的紫梗（火漆），质量俱佳，用途甚广。此外，还有紫檀树、安息香、白豆蔻等特产。老挝蕴藏着很多的锡、铁、金、白金、银、锑、煤、锰、铅和宝石等矿产，但已开采的很少。战前有两个规模较大的锡矿，每年输出锡砂约1，800吨。战后只有一处锡矿恢复生产，1953年产锡560吨。
    湄公河及其支流和许多池沼之间，淡水渔业很发达。湄公河沿岸的万象和琅勃剌邦，是渔业两大中心地。
    湄公河纵贯老挝全国。由于峡多水急，航运困难，但有丰富的水力，将来可利用发电。上游从万象到素旺一段，终年可通小汽船，素旺以下，河上有三大险滩，所以汽船不能从西贡直航万象。陆上因为深谷与高山互相重叠，交通十分困难。公路长约3，000公里。其中主要的一条公路，从琅勃剌邦经万象、他曲和沙湾拿吉，可以通到柬埔寨和越南南部的西贡。老挝和越南东部沿海的宜安、洞海和广治等地，也有公路相连。从万象渡湄公河，可经泰国的铁路通暹罗湾。
    老挝和越南、柬埔寨、泰国之间的贸易很频繁。有些老挝的产品，远销到菲律宾、欧洲和美洲等地。老挝的出口货物有各种珍贵的林产、锡砂、咖啡、烟叶、象、象牙、牛等；进口货物有盐、布和工业制成品等。
    和柬埔寨、缅甸、锡兰等国一样，老挝也是东南亚的一个佛教国家，但也受到婆罗门教的影响；此外，还有人信仰基督教和中国的道教。老挝古代文化甚为发达。在它的文化发展过程中，佛教曾经起了很大的作用。1350年，国王范甘延聘高僧，广传佛教。到悉达第罗王时，迁都万象，筑城堡，建庙宇，文化鼎盛。宗教的建筑构成了美术的中心。寺院装饰精致，色彩绚烂。宝塔是老挝城市建筑的主要组成部分之一。万象精致的佛塔和浮雕以及琅勃剌邦辉煌的皇宫和大殿，都是老挝的文化宝藏，也是老挝劳动人民的心血结晶。
    老挝的文字是从巴利文衍变而来，语言是单缀语。现存的有关宗教文学著作大半是写本。老挝的诗有自己的风格，由九句到十二句构成。老挝人民非常喜爱音乐。舞蹈接受了印度的影响。老挝民间流传着许多歌颂恋爱的优美的民谣。每年有许多祭祀，是民间的祀神盛典，也是庆祝劳动成果的文化娱乐集会。其中有“灌水祭”、“耕作祭”、“收获祭”等等，而六月间举行的“佛陀之祭”，则是一年中最盛大的祭祀。
    由于过去长期遭受殖民者的统治，老挝的现代教育还不发达。现有学校约280所，学生16，000人左右。中学不多，高等学校还待创立。
    取得独立地位以后，老挝人民已在着手改善自己的经济文化情况。富马首相今年二月二十八日在国民议会中宣布，政府正在研究一个五年计划。这个计划的目的是，修整道路系统和改进可以通航的水路，发展农业和畜牧业以及探查和开发地下资源。现在，老挝王国宣布实行和平中立政策，万象会谈也达成了走向全国和平统一的协议。国内外形势都有利于老挝的建设。因此，今后老挝的经济的恢复和繁荣、文化的发展和提高，是可以预期的。（附图片）
