Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 13th: Farmers in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area in Shaanxi Province have begun to migrate. On the 11th, more than 500 farmers departed from Xi'an by automobile for the Yinchuan area of Gansu Province. In the next ten days or so, more than 4,000 more people will depart in batches.

The Sanmenxia Reservoir project occupies more than two million mu of land, most of which is in Shaanxi Province. To support the smooth progress of this great project, the farmers in the reservoir area of Shaanxi are determined to respond to the government's call and migrate in batches starting this year. The first batch of migrants are all young and middle-aged people and agricultural cooperative cadres, many of whom are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They will first build houses and reclaim wasteland in the resettlement area of the Yinchuan Special District in Gansu, creating conditions for the future migration of their entire families, cooperatives, and villages. The family life problems of those who leave have also been properly arranged.

Before the migrants departed, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee had initially formulated a plan for reasonably handling migrant property and compensating for losses. The state will allocate land to the migrants in the resettlement areas and issue land reclamation subsidies. The state will also provide demolition and relocation compensation for the houses demolished and relocated by the migrants. When building houses in the resettlement area, the state will provide assistance in terms of materials and design technology to fully ensure that the migrants' living standards are no lower than their current level. At present, more than 60,000 rafters purchased by the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee for the migrants to build houses have been transported to the Yinchuan resettlement area. More than 100 head of livestock, more than 50 carts, and more than 3,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows and other agricultural implements needed for the first batch of migrants to build houses and reclaim wasteland are also being transported to the resettlement area by the state in advance.

    三门峡水库区农民开始迁移
    新华社西安13日电　陕西境内三门峡水库区的农民开始迁移。十一日，五百多名农民乘汽车从西安出发前往甘肃省银川地区。在最近十天左右，还有四千多人也将分批出发。
    三门峡水库工程占地二百多万亩，其中大部分在陕西境内。水库区内的陕西农民们为了支援这一伟大工程的顺利进行，都决心响应政府号召，从今年开始分批迁移。第一批移民中都是青壮年和农业社骨干，其中有很多人是共产党员和青年团员。他们将先在甘肃银川专区的安置区修建房舍，开垦荒地，为将来全家、全社、全村的迁移创造条件。他们走后的家庭生活问题，也都得到了妥善的安排。
    陕西省人民委员会在移民出发前，已初步制定了合理处理移民财产、补偿损失的方案。国家将在安置地区分配给移民土地，并发给垦荒补助费。对移民拆除、迁建的房屋，国家也将给予拆除迁建补偿费。在安置区修建房屋时，国家将在材料、设计技术方面给予协助，以充分保证移民生活不低于现在的水平。现在，陕西省人民委员会购备的移民盖房用的六万多根木椽，已经运到银川安置区。首批移民盖房、开荒需用的一百多头牲畜，五十多辆大车和三千多件双轮双铧犁等农具，也由国家负责提前运往安置区。
