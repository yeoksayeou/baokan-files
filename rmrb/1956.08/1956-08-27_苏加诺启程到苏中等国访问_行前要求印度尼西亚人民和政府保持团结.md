Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 26th: President Sukarno and his entourage of forty people left here this afternoon to visit the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the People's Republic of China.

    In a brief speech before his departure, Sukarno called on the Indonesian people, and especially the government, to "maintain unity and cherish Indonesia's good reputation in its efforts to strive for progress."

    He said, "If a spirit of friendship permeates among our leaders, all the problems we currently face can be solved."

    He pointed out, "The main purpose of the Republic of Indonesia is not only to make its independence impeccable and to seek happiness for its people, but also to realize world peace and cooperation among all countries in the world."

    He said, "If we can maintain our unity and cultivate a spirit of friendship, all difficulties can certainly be resolved."

    Vice President Hatta, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, senior military and government officials, and foreign diplomatic envoys were at the airport to see him off.

    President Sukarno will stop in Bangkok and Karachi en route to Moscow and will spend the night in Tehran. The President is expected to arrive in Moscow on August 28.
