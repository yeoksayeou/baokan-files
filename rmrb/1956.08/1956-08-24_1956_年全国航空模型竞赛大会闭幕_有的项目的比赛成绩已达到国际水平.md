    The competition included five events, all conducted according to international competition regulations. The Xi'an Aviation Academy team achieved first place with a total score of 2,454 points (the highest possible score was 2,700 points), followed by the Beijing team with 2,270 points, the Shanghai team with 1,863 points, the Nanjing Aviation Academy team with 1,825 points, and the Nanjing team with 1,768 points. They secured second, third, fourth, and fifth places, respectively (a total of five places were awarded).

    The first place winner in the Level 2 Glider Towing Model category was Li Yulian from the Wuhan team, the second place winner was Li Changzhou from the Tianjin team, and the third place winner was Bao Yuhan from the Nanjing Aviation Academy team. The first place winner in the Level 2 Rubber-Band Powered Model Airplane category was Shou Erkang from the Beijing team, the second place winner was Shi Dingbang from the Xi'an Aviation Academy team, and the third place winner was Li Rongxue from the Xi'an team. The first place winner in the Level 3 Rubber-Band Powered Model Airplane category was Tang Yijun from the Xi'an Aviation Academy team, the second place winner was Shi Zhida from the Beijing team, and the third place winner was Lu Zhongyi from the Shanghai team. The first place winner in the Level 1 Free Flight Piston Engine Model Airplane category was Liu Mingdao from the Xi'an Aviation Academy team, the second place winner was Gu Qiyuan from the Beijing team, and the third place winner was Ling Qizhang from the Shanghai team. In the above five events, except for the Level 2 Glider Towing Model category, the first-place winners in the other four categories all achieved the maximum score (540 points).

    Athletes who won first and second place in individual events in this competition have reached the standard of second-class aviation model athletes, and athletes who won third place have reached the standard of third-class athletes.

    Zhong Linde, a member of the Xi'an Aviation Academy team participating in the speed model airplane test, achieved a speed of 234 kilometers per hour with his jet-powered speed model airplane, which is equivalent to the second-place level in the international competition held in Prague in 1955.

    The technical advisor invited to the conference, Comrade Maldenov, a Soviet aviation model athlete, said that the results of the towing, rubber band, and free flight events in this competition are equivalent to the level in the Soviet Union. (Yang Mingxun) (Photo attached)
