Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 13th: Sharma, head of the Nepalese Cultural Delegation to China, Minister of Education, Health, and Local Autonomy of the Nepalese government, told reporters in Hong Kong on August 11th that China's culture and art have experienced a genuine renaissance since 1949. Now, it has achieved tremendous development on a mass basis. "What impressed me most was the integration of traditional and modern art; even traditional martial arts operas have new significance."

He said that after returning to Kathmandu, he would formally invite a Chinese cultural and artistic delegation to visit Nepal.

Speaking about China's industrialization plan, Sharma said: Before coming to China, we thought that China had been bound by foreign and feudal forces for a long time, and its industry must not be very good. But after personally visiting automobile factories, steel factories, and other heavy industrial sectors, we realized that they have made such significant achievements in reviving old industries and building new industries in just seven years.

He said that the Chinese people have a strong sense of responsibility, enthusiasm for work, and spirit of unity. He expressed that he is completely optimistic about China's future.

Sharma spoke of his meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, and said that Chairman Mao Zedong's life is simple, his thoughts are outstanding, and his attitude is amiable and approachable. This is precisely the condition that an ideal great leader of our Orient should possess. We only talked for half an hour, but it was as if we had known each other for several years.

    尼泊尔访华团团长赞扬新中国
    表示对中国的前途完全乐观
    据新华社香港13日电　尼泊尔访华文化代表团团长，教育、卫生、地方自治政府大臣夏尔马八月十一日在香港对记者说，中国的文化艺术在1949年以后获得了真正的复兴。现在它已经在群众的基础上获得了巨大的发展。“尤其使我印象深刻的是传统艺术和近代艺术的融合，即使是传统的武剧也有它的新的意义”。
    他说，他回到加德满都以后将正式邀请一个中国文化艺术代表团到尼泊尔去访问。
    谈到中国的工业化计划的时候，夏尔马说：在到中国以前，我们以为中国长期受到外国和封建势力的束缚，它的工业一定好不了多少，可是当我们亲自参观了汽车厂、钢铁厂等重工业部门以后，才知道他们在短短七年内，在复兴旧工业和建设新工业方面竟有了如此重大的成就。
    他说，中国人民有强烈的责任感和工作热情和团结精神。他表示他对中国的前途是完全乐观的。
    夏尔马谈到受毛泽东主席接见的情形，并且说，毛泽东主席生活简朴，思想卓越，态度和蔼可亲，这正是我们东方人理想的伟大领袖所该具有的条件。我们仅作了半小时的谈话，但彼此间已经像是认识了几年的朋友似的。
