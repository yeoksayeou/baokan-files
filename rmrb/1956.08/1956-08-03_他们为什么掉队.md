Why Did They Fall Behind?
By our staff reporter Wang Lin

Since the public-private joint venture Tangshan Huaxin Cotton Textile Factory launched the advanced producer movement, it has selected advanced producers three times. Although many new advanced producers have emerged each time, a large number of advanced producers have also fallen behind. According to the results of the selections in April and May (June's have not yet been evaluated), among the 1,454 advanced producers selected before April, 411 fell behind, accounting for over 28.8% of the total number of advanced producers.

Why did they fall behind? Zheng Guoxing, the vice chairman of the factory's trade union, and Geng Ruijun, the secretary of the Party committee office, said: The Municipal Party Committee required that by the end of the fourth quarter, the advanced producer ranks should be expanded to 70% of the factory's total employees, and specified specific targets to be achieved each quarter. The implication is that, in order to meet the Municipal Party Committee's requirements for expanding the ranks of advanced producers, they couldn't focus on cultivating and improving the existing advanced producers.

The Municipal Party Committee's stipulation of targets for expanding the ranks of advanced producers may not be appropriate. However, continuously expanding the ranks of advanced producers is always right. To achieve this goal, we must rely on advanced producers and ordinary producers to learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, overcome weaknesses, and improve together. The leadership must earnestly create conditions for advanced producers to continue to advance. However, this factory only focused on letting advanced producers lead and help others, but neglected to continue cultivating and improving existing advanced producers, rarely listened to their opinions and demands, and solved their work difficulties. In the first workshop of the yarn division, the lighting was too dim. Night shift fine yarn workers found it difficult to check for thread breaks unless they put their eyes close to the spindles, which directly affected product quality. Workers repeatedly requested a solution to this problem, but no one has paid attention to it to date. In the second workshop of the yarn division, the temperature and humidity have not been well controlled for half a year. The places where the wind should be strong are weak, and the places where the wind should be weak are strong. The temperature in the workshop is very high, so that the end breakage rate and the cotton waste rate always exceed the national standards. The advanced production team led by Han Guihua (a representative attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers) was therefore unable to maintain the advanced record it had achieved. They had raised their opinions to the leadership many times, but it was not resolved until July 2nd. Many advanced producers' successful experiences were not affirmed, and obstacles encountered on the way forward could not be eliminated in time. Not only could their advanced role not be fully utilized, but the advanced quotas already achieved could not be maintained, and they even failed to complete the production plan, thus becoming dropouts.

In the serious situation of advanced producers falling behind in large numbers and a large number of direct production workers being unable to fully complete production tasks, it is naturally impossible for a truly large number of advanced producers to emerge. The Huaxin Cotton Textile Factory even adopted the method of making up the numbers to "expand the advanced production team." The fine yarn workshop, where only more than one hundred people comprehensively completed the production tasks, selected 208 people who reached the level of advanced producers in June. In the dyeing factory, any auxiliary worker who did not have an accident in a month was nominated as an advanced producer. As a result, from a formal point of view, the ranks of advanced producers were expanded and the advanced producer movement was deepened, but in reality, it damaged the development of the real advanced producer movement.

    他们为什么掉队
    本报记者　王林
    公私合营唐山华新棉纺织厂，自开展先进生产者运动以来，已经评选过三次先进生产者。每次评选虽然有不少新的先进生产者出现，但是也有成批的先进生产者掉队。据四、五两月评选的结果统计（六月的还没有评），在四月以前评选出的一千四百五十四名先进生产者中，有四百一十一人掉队，占先进生产者总数的28.8％强。
    他们为什么掉队了？厂工会的副主席郑国兴，党委办公室的秘书耿瑞军说：市委要求到第四季度末，把先进生产者队伍扩大到全厂职工总数的70％，并规定了每一季度要达到的具体指标。言外之意就是说，要达到市委对扩大先进生产者队伍的要求，就顾不上培养和提高现有的先进生产者了。
    市委规定扩大先进生产者队伍的指标，这种做法不一定合适。但是，不断扩大先进生产者队伍总是对的。要达到这个目的，就要依靠先进生产者同普通生产者互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高，就要领导上认真地为先进生产者创造继续前进的条件。但是这个厂只注意了让先进生产者去带动和帮助别人，却忽略了继续培养和提高现有先进生产者，很少去听取他们的意见和要求，解决他们工作中的困难。纱场的一场，灯光太暗，夜班的细纱工人不把眼睛凑到锭子切近的地方，就很难检查出是否出了断头，这直接影响着产品的质量。工人们一再请求解决这个问题，但迄今无人过问。纱场的二场，半年来温湿度掌握得不好，该风大的地方风小，该风小的地方反而很大，场房里的温度很高，以致断头率和白花率总是超过国家规定的指标。韩桂花（出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表）领导的先进生产小组，因此不能保持已经达到的先进纪录。她们曾经向领导上提过多次意见，但一直拖到七月二日才得到解决。很多先进生产者创造的成功的经验没有人肯定，在前进途中遇着障碍不能及时消除。他们的先进作用固然不能充分发挥，已经达到的先进定额，也不能继续保持，甚至完不成生产计划，而成为掉队者。
    在先进生产者成批掉队、大量的直接生产工人不能全面完成生产任务的严重情况下，自然不可能有真正大量的先进生产者出现。华新棉纺织厂竟采取凑数的办法来“扩大先进生产队伍”。只有一百多人全面完成生产任务的细纱车间，六月份却评选出二百零八个达到先进生产者水平的人。在染厂，凡是一个月中没出事故的辅助工，就被提名为先进生产者。这样作的结果，从形式上看，先进生产者队伍是扩大了，先进生产者运动是深入了，实际上却损害了真正的先进生产者运动的开展。
