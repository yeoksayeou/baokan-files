Xinhua News Agency, August 13th. According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency, the Yugoslav newspaper "Politika" published a commentary today on Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's statement at a press conference on the 12th, saying that Abdel Nasser's resolute rejection of the invitation for Egypt to participate in the London conference (a conference that will make pre-arranged decisions about a part of Egyptian territory) demonstrates a realistic attitude, and a realistic attitude that has been confirmed by the estimation of some obvious facts.

"Politika" said that Abdel Nasser is not limited to simply rejecting orders from others and passively allowing his opponents to defend themselves at the London conference (where they want to attack Abdel Nasser). In his reply, Nasser also actively developed the idea of international cooperation and proposed a simple and reasonable counter-proposal.

"Politika" concluded that this is a broader approach in all aspects, regarding the qualifications of participating countries, the composition of participating countries, and the purpose of the conference, while not making any decisions in advance. All relevant parties, including Britain and France, can now adopt a truly international method to resolve the Suez crisis without losing their prestige.

    南斯拉夫报纸认为
    埃及采取现实态度
    据新华社13日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，南斯拉夫“政治报”今天就埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔十二日在记者招待会上的声明发表评论说，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔断然拒绝了要埃及参加伦敦会议（这个会议将对埃及的一部分领土作出事先准备好的决定）的邀请，这种作法表明了一种现实态度，并且是一种已经被对于一些明显的事实所作的估计证实了的现实态度。
    “政治报”说，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔并不只限于单单拒绝别人的命令，和白白地听任他的对手们在伦敦会议上（他们想在这个会议上攻击阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔）为他们自己辩护。纳赛尔还在他的答复中积极地发展了国际合作的主张，并且提出了一种既简单又合理的反建议。
    “政治报”最后说，这是一个在各方面都比较广泛的途径，就与会国的资格、与会国的组成和会议的目的而论都是这样，同时又不在事先作出任何决定。包括英国和法国在内的一切有关方面现在都可以采取真正是国际的方法来解决苏彝士危机而不至于丧失它们的威信。
