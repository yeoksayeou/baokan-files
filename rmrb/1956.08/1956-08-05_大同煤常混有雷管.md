    Datong Coal Often Mixed with Detonators
    The mixed coal allocated to our city from Datong Coal Mine often contains detonators. We picked out three detonators in January this year, and another one in June. In May, Wang Xiqun, a villager from Pangma Village, Xingtai County, was using the mine's mixed coal to cook lunch when a detonator suddenly exploded, injuring his arm and buttocks. He was saved from danger after emergency treatment. We hope that Datong Coal Mine will take effective measures as soon as possible to avoid similar accidents and ensure the safety of coal use for the masses.

    大同煤常混有雷管
    大同煤矿调拨我市的混炭中经常混有雷管。今年元月份我们捡出了三个雷管，六月份又发现了一个。五月份有邢台县庞马村村民王喜群中午用该矿混炭做饭，忽然雷管爆炸，炸伤了手臂和屁股。经过紧急调治，才转危为安。希望大同煤矿早日采取有效措施，避免类似事故再次发生，保证群众用煤安全。
