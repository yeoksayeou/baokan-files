    Huaxin Cement Plant's No. 2 Kiln
    Creates New Safety Record
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) As of midnight on July 30th, the No. 2 kiln of the joint state-private Huaxin Cement Plant in Huangshi City created a new record of 220 days of safe operation, increasing the national cement output by more than 6,000 tons and saving more than 10,000 yuan in repair costs.
    The No. 2 kiln is 145 meters long and is one of the largest cement kilns in the country in terms of volume.
    Recently, the employees of the No. 2 kiln have actively promoted the advanced operating methods created by workers Chen Yungui and Liu Biao of the plant, such as "advance small slow-speed operation" and "stabilizing the kiln's firing temperature," keeping the temperature inside the kiln at a uniform level for a long time and maintaining the rapid operation of the cement kiln, which improved cement production and quality. At the same time, they have strengthened the protection and inspection of the kiln skin. This new record is more than double the highest safety record in the plant's history.

    二号窑长达145公尺，是全国体积最大的水泥窑之一。
    最近，二号窑的职工，积极推广了本厂工人陈运贵、刘彪创造的“提前打小慢车”、“稳定窑内烧成温度”等先进操作法，使窑内温度长期处于均匀状态，并且保持了水泥窑的快速运转，提高了水泥的产量和质量。同时，他们又加强了对窑皮的保护、检查工作。这次创造的新纪录比这个厂历史上最高的安全运转纪录还高出一倍以上。
