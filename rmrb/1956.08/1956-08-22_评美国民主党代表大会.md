    A Critique of the US Democratic Party Convention
    Guo Mu
    The US Democratic Party National Convention opened in Chicago on the 13th of this month, and after five days of clamor and noise, it concluded on the 17th. This convention adopted a campaign platform and elected Stevenson and Kefauver as the Democratic Party's candidates for president and vice president this year.
    In the "two-party system" of the United States, every presidential election year, the two parties, both representing the interests of the monopoly capitalist groups, engage in mutual attacks and disputes to confuse voters and win votes. This year, the opposition Democratic Party, taking advantage of the American people's dissatisfaction with the current government's domestic and foreign policies, attacked the ruling Republican Party as usual. At this Democratic Party convention and in the pre-convention campaign, Democratic politicians repeatedly accused the Republican government of being a "cabinet of millionaires," while portraying the Democratic Party as the "protector" of the interests of farmers, workers, and small business owners.
    They refuted the Republican Party's claims of American economic "prosperity," pointing out that "prosperity" was merely an "illusion" for American farmers, workers, and small business owners, while large corporations benefited greatly. In terms of foreign policy, targeting the Republican Party's self-proclaimed "peace" slogan, the Democratic Party attacked the Republican government for repeatedly bringing the United States to the brink of war, and criticized the Republican Party's clumsy diplomacy for causing the United States to "lose out in the Cold War," with its prestige abroad falling to "an unprecedented low." The Democratic Party's exposure of these misdeeds of the US government in domestic and foreign affairs is in line with the facts. However, Democratic politicians have avoided the fact that the Republican government's important domestic and foreign policies have always been supported by the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in Congress.
    The Democratic Party is doing its best to show that it is better than the Republican Party, attempting to convince the majority of voters that they can change the current predicament of the United States. Stevenson, the newly elected Democratic presidential candidate, made a so-called "New America" promise to American voters at the closing session of this convention. According to Stevenson himself, the campaign platform adopted by this Democratic Party convention is a "signpost pointing to this New America." But if people look at this Democratic Party campaign platform, it will become clear that the Democratic Party's "signpost pointing to a New America" has nothing new to offer on fundamentally important policy issues.
    For example, the foreign policy section of this Democratic Party platform proposes to "restore the Democratic Party's policy of seeking peace through strength." Everyone knows that the Republican government has basically inherited the so-called "position of strength" policy of the Truman administration in foreign affairs for several years, and it is this policy that has brought and continues to bring failures to the United States. The Democratic Party's platform also trumpets that the United States must have "sufficient" armed forces, even though the Democratic Party clearly knows that the Republican government has not relaxed the arms race. Like the Republican Party's policies, this Democratic Party platform also expresses "determination to oppose" the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations and to continue to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is the most reactionary policy.
    In terms of domestic policy, the Democratic Party, considering the crucial role of the attitudes of farmers, laborers, and blacks in the election, made certain promises in the relevant clauses of the platform in order to win this part of the vote. For example, the domestic policy section of this platform promises farmers that they will receive fully equal income, workers that the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law will be repealed, and blacks that racial discrimination will be eliminated. But these beautiful promises, as shown by the actual actions of the Democratic or Republican parties after being elected to power in the past, are to be forgotten as soon as the election is over. The hypocritical nature of this promise is also evidenced by this kind of reaction: Many Democrats believe that if the Democratic Party wins this year's election, this platform will put the future Democratic government in a serious dilemma.
    Nevertheless, the Democratic Party's selection of these issues to attack the Republican Party in the campaign and to make these promises, in a sense, illustrates the domestic political climate in the United States. The American people demand to abandon the "Cold War," end the arms race, eliminate the threat of war, and improve the economic situation. They are dissatisfied with the policies adopted by the government in recent years, policies that have made the United States unprecedentedly isolated internationally while adding a heavy burden to the people. Under the influence of the development of the situation, the people's movement for peace and democracy in the United States has developed significantly. It is this development that has forced the politicians of the two parties to take it into consideration in this election year. The Democratic Party, as the opposition party, believes that it is a good strategy to disguise itself as the advocate of the people's interests and to attack the Republican Party for being responsible for all the failures and difficulties encountered by the United States.
    However, since the Republican government has merely inherited the policy guidelines of the Truman administration, since the Republican government has promoted its various major policies with the cooperation of the Democratic Party, and since the Democratic Party has not put forward any new and positive program of action on some major policy issues, the Democratic Party's empty - though not unfounded - attacks on the Republican Party cannot win it much political capital. The Democratic Party's weak and ineffective attacks on the Republican Party's misdeeds show the extent of the corruption of the American two-party system.

    评美国民主党代表大会
    果木
    美国民主党全国代表大会本月十三日在芝加哥开幕，经过五天的喧嚷吵闹，已于十七日宣告收场。这次大会通过了一个竞选纲领，并选出了史蒂文森和克弗维尔为民主党今年的总统、副总统候选人。
    在“两党制度”下的美国，每逢总统选举年，两个同是代表垄断资本集团利益的政党，为了迷惑选民、骗取选票，总要相互攻击吵嚷一番。今年，在野的民主党，利用美国人民对现政府内外政策的不满，照例向当政的共和党进行了攻击。在这次民主党代表大会上以及在会前的竞选宣传中，民主党的政客一再指责共和党政府是个“百万富翁的内阁”，而将民主党装扮成为农民、工人、小企业家利益的“保护人”。
    他们驳斥了共和党提出来的关于美国经济“繁荣”的说法，指出“繁荣”对于美国农民、工人、小企业家来说不过是一种“幻觉”，而是大公司得到了极大好处。在外交政策方面，针对共和党为自己吹嘘的“和平”口号，民主党攻击共和党政府曾使美国一再频临战争的边缘，并且批评共和党的拙笨外交已使美国“在冷战中失利”，国外的威信降到“从来未曾如此低落”的程度。民主党揭发的这些美国政府在内政外交上的劣迹，是合乎事实的。但是民主党的政客们却避开了一个事实，就是共和党政府的重要的内政和外交政策，一直是得到了在国会中占据多数的民主党的合作的。
    民主党竭力想表现自己比共和党高明，企图使广大选民相信他们能够改变美国目前所处的困境。刚刚当选民主党总统候选人的史蒂文森，就在这次代表大会的闭幕会议上，向美国选民提出了所谓“新美国”的诺言。据史蒂文森自己说，这次民主党代表大会通过的竞选纲领，就是“指向这个新美国的路标”。可是人们如果看了这个民主党的竞选纲领，就会明了民主党的“指向新美国的路标”，在具有根本重要性的政策问题上并没有什么新鲜东西。
    例如，民主党这个纲领的外交政策部分，提出要“恢复民主党的通过实力谋求和平的政策”。大家知道，共和党政府几年来在外交上基本上是承袭了杜鲁门政府的所谓“实力地位”政策的，正是这种政策，为美国招致了并且继续招致着失败。民主党的纲领还鼓吹美国必须拥有“足够的”武装力量，虽然民主党明明知道共和党政府并没有放松过军备竞赛。和共和党的政策一样，民主党的这个纲领也表示“决心反对”恢复中国在联合国的席位，并且要继续支持蒋介石集团。这是最反动的政策。
    在国内政策方面，民主党考虑到农民、劳工和黑人的态度在选举中的关键性作用，为了争取这部分选票，他们在纲领有关条文中作了某些诺言。例如，这个纲领的内政部分，对农民就有保证使农民得到完全平等的收入的诺言，对工人就有取消塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法的诺言，对黑人就有消除种族歧视的诺言。但是这些漂亮诺言，正像以往民主党或共和党获选当政后的实际行动所显示的，是只要选举一结束，就要被忘掉的。这种诺言的虚伪性质，从这样的一种反应也得到证明：有许多民主党人认为：如果民主党在今年选举中获胜的话，这个纲领就会使未来的民主党政府陷于严重的进退两难的境地。
    虽然如此，民主党在竞选中选择这些问题来对共和党进行攻击，并且作出这些诺言，在某种意义上毕竟是说明美国国内的政治气候的。美国人民要求抛开“冷战”，终止军备竞赛，消除战争威胁和改善经济情况。他们不满意政府几年来所采取的政策，这种政策使得美国在国际上空前孤立，同时给人民加上沉重的负担。在形势发展的影响下，美国国内主张和平民主的人民运动有了显著的发展，正是这种发展使得两党的政客们在这选举年中不得不加以考虑，而作为在野党的民主党认为，把自己扮成人民利益的拥护者，出来攻击共和党应对美国所遭遇的一切失败和困难负责，是得策的。
    可是，既然共和党政府不过是承袭了杜鲁门政府的政策方针，既然共和党政府是在民主党的合作下推行它的各种重大政策的，既然民主党并没有在一些重大的政策问题上提出任何新的积极的行动纲领，因此民主党对共和党的那些空泛的——虽然并非没有根据的——攻击也就并不能替它赢得多少政治资本。民主党对共和党劣迹的这种软弱无力的攻击，倒是说明美国两党制度腐朽的程度。
