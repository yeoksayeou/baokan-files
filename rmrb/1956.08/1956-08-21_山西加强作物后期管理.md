Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 16th. Rural areas in Shanxi Province are currently carrying out late-stage management activities for grain and cotton crops to prevent insufficient soil fertility from affecting their development and growth. During this activity, agricultural cooperatives in various localities are calculating agricultural work hours, allocating labor, and rationally adjusting quotas. Many women and semi-able-bodied laborers have also been mobilized to participate in various tasks they can handle. In Changzhi Prefecture, many agricultural cooperatives have also adopted the method of assigning agricultural work to households, setting quality, quantity, work points, and deadlines for completion. So far, in the Jinan Prefecture, which is a major cotton-producing area, 3.86 million mu of cotton fields have generally been hoed three to four times, and one-quarter of the cotton fields have been top-dressed with fertilizer. 60% of the cotton fields have started pruning early. Farmers in Changzhi and other prefectures have also implemented soil cultivation when applying top dressing to corn.

    山西加强作物后期管理
    新华社太原16日电　山西省农村中正在开展粮、棉作物后期加工管理活动，防止因地劲不足而影响它们的发育生长。在这一活动中，各地农业社都计算农活时间，调配劳动力，合理调整定额。许多妇女和半劳动力也被发动起来，参加各项能够担负的工作。长治专区不少农业社还采取了农活归户、定质、定量、定工分和限期完成的办法。到目前为止，在盛产棉花的晋南专区，三百八十六万亩棉花已经普遍锄过三次到四次，并且有四分之一的棉田施了追肥，60％的棉田提早开始整枝。长治等专区的农民在给玉米追肥时，还实行了培土。
