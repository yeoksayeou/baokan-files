China, Albania Sends Greetings to You!
Lin Li

In May and June of this year, I was invited to Albania to attend the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and to visit Albania's construction achievements. From Tirana, the capital of Albania, I went to Shkodër, an ancient city in the north; from Durrës and Vlorë on the Adriatic coast, to the beautiful southern cities of Gjirokastër and Sarandë. The revolutionary holy land of Korçë left a deep impression on me, and the new atmosphere of the Stalin Oil City is unforgettable. I met many people and visited many places in Albania. What impressed me most was the Albanian people's respect and boundless enthusiasm for the Chinese people. Although it was my first time in Albania, I felt like I had returned to my hometown after many years. Every Albanian felt like a long-lost relative.

As I strolled along the streets of Tirana with several Chinese comrades, I saw all the Albanians smiling at us. Children followed us in groups, shouting. Their eyes were full of enthusiasm, curiosity, and respect. The children threw flowers at us and greeted us innocently, clapping their hands and saying, "Welcome 'Kines' (Albanian for Chinese)," or shouting, "Mao Zedong!" Sometimes, we would occasionally kiss a girl's face or pat a boy's head, and those children who were kissed or patted would immediately run back to their parents like lively birds, happily boasting, "The 'Kines' kissed my face," or "The 'Kines' patted my head." Their fathers and mothers would then greet us from afar.

The day after the congress closed, I accompanied the delegation of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to travel to southern Albania. In almost every town or village we passed, there were cheering crowds. Some small mountain villages, fearing that the Chinese representatives would not get out of the car, even put up ropes on the edge of the village in advance. They said, "Even if it's just to meet and shake hands." The responsible persons of the local party committees and governments not only went to the border areas under their jurisdiction to greet us, but also kept sending us out of their jurisdiction. When the Chinese representatives arrived in Sarandë, it was already dark. The reception staff, fearing that we were too tired, let us bypass the welcoming crowds and go directly to the hotel. But as soon as we walked into the hotel entrance, people swarmed over, demanding to meet with the Chinese representatives, shouting "Welcome Kines!" and rhythmically clapping and shouting, "Mao Zedong!" When the Chinese representatives walked out of the hotel, they were immediately surrounded by countless flowers. Countless hands reached out from the crowd. Many people were not satisfied with shaking hands once, turning around to shake hands a second or third time... People cheered, people clapped, people rushed to greet the Chinese representatives, until the hosts led the Chinese representatives to the platform on the roof of the hotel, so that everyone who welcomed us could see our faces, and until the Chinese representatives spoke, people reluctantly and slowly left the front of the hotel...

The Albanian people love the Chinese people and regard making friends with the Chinese as a great happiness and pleasure. The night before leaving Tirana, the clock had passed twelve o'clock, and I couldn't sleep, thinking about what I had seen and heard in Albania, thinking about my friends in the press, thinking about every word I had said at the banquet just now, thinking, thinking... Suddenly there was a burst of "bang, bang, bang" knocking on the door. I turned on the light, opened the door, and the person who came in handed me a telegram, said "Sorry, good night!" and left. I opened the telegram and saw only a few words on it: "Wish you a safe journey." The telegram was sent from the city of Peshkopi, and the sender was Said Hika Guroshi, a staff member of the People's Theater. He originally lived in Tirana and went to the countryside for performances a week ago. During this week, he made two long-distance calls, each time with these two sentences: "Wish you good health, and send my regards to the Chinese people after you return home." Said had made friends and corresponded with a dozen actors from the Central Song and Dance Troupe of China. But he felt that he had too few Chinese friends and wanted to make more Chinese friends. He said that the more exchanges between the people, the closer and more consolidated the friendship between China and Albania will be.

Said's words reminded me of Dimio Kleni from Muzina Village. This is a middle-aged man who lost his left arm in the war and had two bullet scars on his cheeks. His village seemed to have only a dozen households and was located on the mountainside of a steep mountain range. When he learned that the Chinese were going to pass by his village, he gathered all the people he could gather and stayed by the roadside all day waiting. But when the Chinese arrived, Dimio was so excited that he couldn't say anything. He took out a photo from his pocket and said that this was a panoramic view of Muzina Village, for which he had paid his left arm and blood. For the friendship between the people of China and Albania, and to commemorate this rare meeting, he wanted the Chinese representatives to accept his photo and convey his respect to the Chinese people.

The Albanian people are enthusiastic. But they are not as accustomed to tight hugs and passionate kisses as ordinary Europeans. Even with the best of friends, they only hug lightly, then put their left cheek to the left cheek, and their right cheek to the right cheek. And this etiquette is limited to the same sex. There is generally no hugging or cheek-touching between men and women. But in the exchanges between the people of China and Albania, they completely broke this habit. In the tobacco factory in Durrës, as soon as the young girls saw the "Kines," they handed over bunches of flowers, and then tiptoed to kiss and hug. The branch secretary of this factory said: The feelings of the female workers are pure and sincere. Because during the drought in Albania, when the people lacked food, the female workers saw with their own eyes bags of rice from China being unloaded at the port of Durrës.

The Albanian people respect the Chinese people and also like Chinese literary works and daily necessities very much. All bookstores have collections of short stories by Guo Moruo and others, and Zhou Libo's "Hurricane" has been translated into Albanian. In the oil city with less than 13,000 people, the number of people watching the Chinese movie "The White Haired Girl" exceeded 12,000. Chinese goods in stores are always placed in the most eye-catching places. Many public and private stores also use the Chinese "People's Pictorial" as a showcase to attract customers. The Albanian poet Aleksei Çaci, who has been to China, always holds his Chinese-style hat in his hand even when he doesn't need a hat. As soon as he saw us, he turned the inside of the hat over and said: "Beijing, Shengxifu product". Vasili Lali, who worked with us, said that when Chinese silk first arrived in Tirana, his wife almost deafened him. She asked him to buy Chinese silk fabric every day. He said that if a city girl does not have a piece of Chinese fabric, it will cause chaos at home and unrest in the neighborhood. The rice and milk powder that China aided Albania have long been eaten. But the bags containing the rice and the wooden barrels containing the milk powder are still treasured by the Albanian people. Some people even display them as decorations.

In Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha asked us to send his regards to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Shehu asked us to wish Comrade Zhou Enlai good health, and Minister of National Defense Balluku said that he had met Comrade Peng Dehuai in Warsaw and asked us to send his regards to Minister Peng Dehuai. The people at the Scientific Research Institute sent greetings to Guo Moruo. The technicians in the oil city learned oil extraction in the Soviet Union. They said that they knew many Chinese students when they were studying in Moscow and asked us to send their regards to them one by one... The entire Albanian people sent their greetings and thanks to their Chinese counterparts. However, where can I find so many people! So I can only say: China, Albania sends greetings to you!

### 中国，阿尔巴尼亚向你问好！

    中国，阿尔巴尼亚向你问好！
    林里
    今年五、六月间，记者应邀到阿尔巴尼亚参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的第三次代表大会，并参观阿尔巴尼亚的建设成就。我从阿尔巴尼亚的首都地拉那，去到北方的古老城市斯库台；从亚得里亚海边的都拉斯和发罗那，去到风景幽美的南方城市纪诺卡斯特和沙兰达。革命圣地科尔查给我留下了深刻的印象，斯大林石油城的新生气象使人长久不忘。我在阿尔巴尼亚接触到了许多人，访问了许多地方，给我印象最深的是阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的尊敬和无限热情。我虽然是第一次到阿尔巴尼亚，但却感到像是回到了多年不见的故乡，每一个阿尔巴尼亚人，也像是久别重逢的亲人。
    我同几个中国同志在地拉那街上闲游，看见所有的阿尔巴尼亚人都在向我们微笑。孩子们成群成群地跟着、嚷着。他们的眼睛里充满了热情、好奇和尊敬。孩子们向我们投掷鲜花，天真地向我们问好，一边还鼓着掌说：“欢迎‘基乃斯’（阿语中国人之意）”，或者高呼：“毛泽东！”有时候，我们偶尔吻一下女孩子的脸，或者抚摸一下男孩子的头，那些被吻或被抚摸的小孩，立刻就像活蹦乱跳的小鸟，飞也似地跑回大人的跟前，嬉皮笑脸地夸耀着：“基乃斯吻了我的脸。”或者说：“基乃斯摸了我的头。”他们的父亲和母亲，也就远远地向我们招呼致意。
    代表大会闭幕的第二天，记者随同中共中央代表团到阿尔巴尼亚南方去旅行。在我们所有路过的大小城镇或乡村，几乎都有夹道欢呼的人群。有些小山庄，怕中国代表不下车，还事先在村边拦上绳子。他们说：“哪怕只是见见面、握握手也好。”地方党委和政府的负责人不光到他们所管辖的边界地带去迎接，而且还一直送出他们的管辖地。中国代表到达沙兰达的时候，天已经黑了。招待人员怕我们疲劳过度，就让我们绕过了欢迎的人群，直接进了旅馆。但是我们刚一走进旅馆的门口，人们就一下拥了过来，他们要求跟中国代表见面，高呼“欢迎基乃斯！”并且有节奏地鼓掌高呼：“毛泽东！”中国代表走出旅馆，立刻就被无数的鲜花包围起来。人丛里伸出了数不清的手，许多人握一次手还不满足，反转身来再握二次、三次……。人们欢呼，人们鼓掌，人们争先恐后地向中国代表问好，直到主人们把中国代表领到旅馆楼顶的平台上，让所有欢迎的人都看见了我们的脸，直到中国代表讲了话以后，人们才依依不舍地慢慢离开旅馆门前……。
    阿尔巴尼亚人热爱中国人民，都把同中国人交朋友当做极大的幸福和愉快。离开地拉那的前一天夜晚，时钟已经过了十二点，我翻来复去睡不着，我想着在阿尔巴尼亚的见闻，想着新闻界的朋友们，想着刚才在宴会上说过的每一句话，想着，想着……突然传来一阵“嘭嘭嘭”的敲门声。我开开灯，开了门，进来的人把一份电报递给我，说了一声“对不起，祝你晚安！”就走了。我打开电报一看，上面只有几个字：“祝你一路顺风。”电报是从贝什柯比城发来的，发电的人是人民剧院的工作人员赛依得·希卡·格乌罗希。他本来住在地拉那，一周前下乡演出。在这一周中，他来过两次长途电话，每次都是这么两句话：“祝你身体健康，回国后向中国人民问好。”赛依得曾同我国中央歌舞团的十几位演员交了朋友，通了信。但他觉得他的中国朋友太少，还要接交更多的中国朋友。他说人民和人民之间的交往越多，中阿两国的友谊就越密切巩固。
    赛依得的话，使我记起了穆兹纳村的季米奥·克莱尼。这是一个在战争中失掉了左臂，两腮上带着两颗弹痕的中年人。他的村子看来不过十多户，又是在丛山峻岭的半山腰。当他知道中国人要从他的村边经过时，他召集了所有能够召集的人，整天呆在路边等候着。但当中国人到了的时候，季米奥却激动得什么也说不出。他从口袋里掏出来一张照片，说这是穆兹纳村的全景，他为它曾经付出过左臂和鲜血。为了中阿两国人民的友谊，也为了纪念这次难得的会见，他要中国代表收下他的照片，并向中国人民转致他的敬意。
    阿尔巴尼亚人是热情的。但他们不像一般欧洲人那样习惯于紧紧的拥抱和狂热的亲吻。即使对待最好的朋友，也只是轻轻地抱一抱，再把左脸挨一挨左脸，右脸挨一挨右脸。而就是这个礼节，也仅限于同性之间。男女之间一般是不拥抱，也不挨脸的。但在中阿两国人民的交往上，他们完全打破了这个习惯。在都拉斯的烟草工厂里，年轻的姑娘们一看见“基乃斯”就把一束束的鲜花递过来，紧接着就踮起脚尖来亲吻、拥抱。这个工厂的支部书记说：女工们的感情是纯洁的、真诚的。因为在阿尔巴尼亚闹旱灾，人民缺少粮食的时候，女工们亲眼看见了中国运来的大米一袋一袋地在都拉斯海港卸下。
    阿尔巴尼亚人尊重中国人，也非常喜欢中国的文学作品和日用品。各个书店里都有郭沫若等人的短篇小说集，周立波的“暴风骤雨”已译成阿文。不满一万三千人的石油城，观看中国电影“白毛女”的人数，竟超过了一万二千人次。商店里的中国商品，总是摆在最惹人注目的地方。许多公私店铺，还把中国的“人民画报”当作招揽顾客的橱窗画。到过中国的阿尔巴尼亚诗人阿列克赛·恰奇，就是在不需要帽子的时候，也总要把那顶中国式的帽子拿在手里。他一看见我们，就把帽里翻过来说：“北京，盛锡福出品”。陪我们一起工作的瓦西里·拉利，他说中国绸子初到地拉那时，他的妻子简直要把他的耳朵吵聋了。她天天要他去买中国绸子衣料。他说一个城市姑娘如果没有一件中国衣料，那就会把家里闹得天翻地复，四邻不安。中国援助阿尔巴尼亚的大米和奶粉早已吃完了。而装大米的袋子和盛奶粉的木筒，却还被阿尔巴尼亚人珍惜地保存着。有的人甚至还把它们当做装饰品陈列起来。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，恩维尔·霍查同志要我们代他向毛泽东同志问候，谢胡同志要我们代他祝福周恩来同志的健康，国防部长巴卢库说，他跟彭德怀同志曾在华沙相见，要我们向彭德怀部长问好。科学研究所的人们问候郭沫若。石油城的技术人员是在苏联学会采油的。他们说，在莫斯科学习时，认识不少中国同学，要我们向他们一一问好……。阿尔巴尼亚的全体人民，都向他们中国的同行同业问好致谢。然而，我向哪里去找这许多人呢！所以我只好说：中国，阿尔巴尼亚向你问好！（附图片）
