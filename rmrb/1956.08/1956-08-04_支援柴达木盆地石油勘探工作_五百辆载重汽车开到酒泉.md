Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 3rd. Recently, the state allocated another 500 trucks to support oil exploration in the Qaidam Basin. Accompanying the trucks were 1,220 drivers, assistants, and management cadres. All personnel and vehicles have successively arrived in Jiuquan, the location of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau Transportation Company.

The newly arrived truck drivers were originally soldiers of the People's Liberation Army with high technical skills. They are excited to participate in the industrial construction of the great Northwest of the motherland, and have written letters of determination and pledges to the leadership, expressing their determination to make new contributions to the transportation work in the Qaidam Basin.
