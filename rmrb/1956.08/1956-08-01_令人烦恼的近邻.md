    Annoying Neighbors
    The Fourth Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry erected a temporary mat-shed stage about five or six meters west of the workers' dormitory of the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3. However, the rest days of these two units are not the same. The company still has Sundays off, while the rest day of Mill No. 3 is Wednesday. Almost every Saturday night, the stage is filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, sometimes even until two or three in the morning. Looking at the workers' dormitory next to the stage, there are workers who have worked all day and have to go to work the next day or late at night, and everyone hopes to sleep peacefully. However, the noise is too loud to fall asleep, especially for female workers with children, who suffer even more. They have just spent a lot of effort to coax their children to sleep, but the noise wakes them up again. Several thousand workers have one day a week when they can't sleep well, affecting their work the next day.
    Before the stage was built, Mill No. 3 had raised several opinions with the person in charge of the construction and installation company, but to no avail. It is said that the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau also knows about this. But why does everyone seem to be unaware and indifferent? A reader

    令人烦恼的近邻
    纺织工业部第四建筑安装工程公司在西北国棉三厂工人宿舍西边约五、六公尺的地方搭了一座席棚的临时戏台。可是这两个单位的休息日不一致，公司还是星期日休假，而三厂的休息日却是星期三，当公司休息的时候，正是三厂工作的日子。差不多每到星期六的晚上，这个戏台上就锣鼓喧天，有时候甚至闹到深夜两三点钟。再看看紧挨着戏台的工人宿舍呢，里面是做了一天工的工人，明天或者深夜就要去做工，大家都希望安安静静地睡好觉，可是喧闹声音太大了，无法睡着，尤其是有孩子的女工更遭罪，刚刚费了好大的劲把孩子哄睡了，喧闹声又把孩子惊醒。几千个工人每个星期总有这么一天睡不好觉，影响第二天的工作。
    早在戏台未搭之前，三厂就曾向建筑安装公司负责人提出几次意见，最后还是没有效果。听说西北纺织工业管理局也知道这件事。但为什么大家都像是不知道似的，不闻不问呢？　一读者
