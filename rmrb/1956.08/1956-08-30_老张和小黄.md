    Old Zhang and Little Huang
    Shen Weipeng
    In the Shanghai Sino-Public Joint Venture Huaming Cigarette Factory, if you mention Old Zhang and Little Huang in the tobacco steaming workshop, everyone will nod and give a thumbs up, saying, "These two comrades are really good, both are advanced producers in the factory!" Outsiders wouldn't know that in the past, one of them was prone to losing his temper at work, and the other was prone to complaining, neither of them were close to being advanced at all.
    Originally, Old Zhang was an old worker in the factory; while Little Huang was just a temporary worker when Shanghai was first liberated. In the past, being a temporary worker was like being a young daughter-in-law under a harsh mother-in-law, working hard and bearing the brunt of hardship, being cautious, and speaking softly; it was really unpleasant. At that time, Little Huang swallowed his anger; if Old Zhang told him to go east, he wouldn't dare go west, all in the hope of becoming a permanent worker soon. However, months passed without any news of becoming a permanent worker, Little Huang was full of complaints and couldn't help but grumble: "Being a temporary worker is like being a nobody." When these words reached Old Zhang's ears, Old Zhang immediately put on a stern face and said, "If you don't want to do it, get out, who asked you to come!" After liberation, Little Huang eventually became a permanent worker. But both of them still had a knot in their hearts. Old Zhang always felt that although Little Huang was a bit clever, he was unwilling to suffer losses and liked to complain, so it was best to ignore him. Little Huang always felt that Old Zhang was like a firecracker, he would explode at the slightest touch, so it was best to avoid him. Years passed, and the knot seemed to remain untied.
    At the beginning of this year, the team leader of this workshop went on long-term sick leave, so Old Zhang and Little Huang were responsible for the workshop's work separately. Old Zhang worked at the head of the machine, and also had to take care of switching on the steam valve in order to control the moisture content. In this way, Old Zhang often had to drop his work to check the valve, and sometimes he had to go to other related workshops to hear their opinions on the moisture content. Soon, the workers at the head of the machine had opinions, saying that Old Zhang running around like this was affecting the work at the head of the machine. When Little Huang heard about it, he wanted to talk to Old Zhang, but he was afraid that a disagreement would ruin things. After considering it again and again, he felt that he should start from the work, so he cautiously stopped Old Zhang and said, "You've been controlling the moisture content very well these past few days, everyone praises you, but..."
    As soon as Old Zhang heard "but," his face changed: "If you have something to say, say it truthfully!"
    Seeing that something was wrong, Little Huang quickly said, "It's nothing, it's nothing."
    Old Zhang became even angrier: "If you have any opinions, raise them face to face, don't be half-hearted!"
    Little Huang thought that things had already become stiff, so he might as well just say it: "When you run around at work, the work at the head of the machine is affected, let's think of a solution together!"
    Old Zhang's face turned red with anger, and he said, "What? I'm connecting with related workshops in order to control the moisture content, I'm not going to play, am I wrong to do that? If you have the ability, you can do it, I can't do this job."
    At this time, Little Huang was really full of complaints and felt extremely wronged, he suppressed it, but thought to himself, "Forget it, forget it, let's just get through the day, doing just enough to get by."
    Soon, Old Zhang was transferred to a job that allowed him to run around and connect with others to control the moisture content. The problem was solved, and the two of them also forgot about it.
    The labor emulation campaign was launched vigorously in the factory. At the end of the first quarter when awarding prizes, Old Zhang was rated as an advanced producer because he had achieved results in controlling moisture content. During the group discussion, everyone was silent for a long time, and Old Zhang himself felt ashamed and said, "I don't have any achievements, but I have a lot of shortcomings, especially my bad temper." Once this started, it was like the floodgates had opened, and everyone raised their opinions. Old Zhang gained a lot of enlightenment.
    Recently, Little Huang saw that the scrap picking workshop was having difficulty completing its tasks, so he used his brains and came up with a method of using an electric fan to blow away the scraps, helping them improve their work efficiency. This work took him three or four hours every day, so he had to come back at night to take care of his own work. Unexpectedly, Old Zhang silently finished his work for him every time.
    During the second quarter's award ceremony, everyone nominated Old Zhang, saying, "Old Zhang has achieved great results in controlling the moisture content, his temper has also improved, and he also actively helps Little Huang with his work." Everyone also nominated Little Huang, saying, "Little Huang helps other workshops complete their tasks, he is also more active and proactive in his own work, and he doesn't complain anymore." Both of them were elected.
    After the meeting, the two waited for an opportunity to get together, smiled embarrassedly, and shook hands tightly.

    老张和小黄
    沈伟鹏
    在上海公私合营华明烟厂里，提起蒸叶工段上的老张和小黄，大家都会点点头，翘起大拇指说：“这两位同志可不错，都是厂里的先进生产者呢！”外来人那里知道，他俩过去在工作上，一个爱发脾气，一个爱发牢骚，一点沾不上先进边儿。
    原来，老张是厂里的老工人；而小黄，在上海刚解放时还是个临时工。从前做临时工，就像在恶婆婆底下当小媳妇似的，干活，吃苦在先，战战兢兢，低声下气，真不好受。小黄那时忍气吞声，老张叫他朝东，他不敢朝西，一切为了早升长工。可是几个月过去，升长工的音信半丝没有，小黄牢骚满肚，忍不住咕噜起来：“做临时工，灰孙子做的。”这话传到老张耳里，老张顿时面孔板起来，说：“不愿做，就滚蛋，谁请你来！”解放后小黄毕竟升了长工。但两人心里总有疙瘩。老张总觉得小黄虽然有些小聪明，但是不肯吃亏，爱发牢骚，少理为妙。小黄总觉得老张是个爆仗，碰碰就发脾气，少惹为妙。几年过去，疙瘩似乎还没解开。
    今年初，这个工段上的小组长因病长期修养去了，工段工作就由老张和小黄分别负责。老张在车头上工作，一面还得照顾开关水汀，以便掌握含水量。这样，老张得常常丢掉手边活，去看水汀，有时还要到别的有关工段去听听他们对含水量的意见。不久，车头上的工人们有意见了，说老张这么跑来跑去，影响车头工作。小黄听说后，想和老张谈谈，又怕一言不合坏了事，考虑再三，觉得应从工作出发，才小心翼翼地叫住老张说：“你这几天掌握含水量很好，大家都称赞，但是……”
    老张听到“但是”，面色就变了：“有什么话，实事求是说出来！”
    小黄一看不对头，连说：“没什么，没什么。”
    老张更火了：“有什么意见当面提，不要半吊子！”
    小黄心想事情已经弄僵，不如直说算了：“你在工作时跑来跑去，车头工作受影响，我们一起想办法吧！”
    老张气得满脸火红，说：“什么？我为了掌握含水量，到有关工段连系连系，又不是去玩，就做错了吗？你有本领你来干，我这行工作干不来。”
    小黄这时真是满肚牢骚，感到委屈得要命，自己抑止住了，心里却说：“算了，算了，大家过一天算两个半天，做一日和尚撞一日钟。”
    不久，老张调了一个工作，可以保证他跑来跑去连系掌握含水量。问题解决，两人也淡忘了。
    劳动竞赛在厂里轰轰烈烈开展起来了。第一季度末评奖时，老张由于掌握含水量有成绩，被评为先进生产者。小组讨论时，大家闷声不响，静默了很久，老张自己惭愧起来，说：“我没啥成绩，缺点倒不少，特别是脾气暴躁。”这么一开头，就像河水开了闸，大家都提起意见来了。老张得到不少启发。
    小黄新近看到拣碎片工段难以完成任务，就开动脑筋想出用电扇吹的方法，帮助他们提高工作效率。这工作得每天花他三、四小时，他只好晚上再来料理自己的工作。不料，老张不言不语地每次都替他做完了。
    第二季度评奖时，大家提名老张说：“老张掌握含水量很有成绩，脾气也改好了，还主动帮助小黄工作。”大家又提名小黄说：“小黄帮助别的工段完成任务，自己工作也比较积极主动，牢骚也不发了。”两人全当选了。
    会后，两人等个机会走到一起，很不好意思地笑了笑，紧紧握了握手。
