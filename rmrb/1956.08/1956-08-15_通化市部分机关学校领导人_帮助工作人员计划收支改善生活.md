    Tonghua City Officials in Some Government Offices and Schools Help Staff Plan Income and Expenses to Improve Life

    (Our Dispatch) Party, government, and trade union leaders in some government offices and schools in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, frequently pay attention to helping staff arrange their lives, plan expenditures, and improve their living standards. For example, the Housing Management Office, the Korean Middle School, and other government offices and schools have included this work in their administrative work plans and have assigned specific personnel to be responsible for it. The principal of the Korean Middle School often combines various major reports to call on teachers and staff to plan expenditures and save money. Last summer vacation, the school teachers were paid two months' salary in advance, and the principal urged them to keep only half a month's salary, and deposit the extra or temporarily unused money in the bank. Recently, school leaders also instructed Li Zongji, the head of the trade union, to go deep into the teaching staff to help arrange their economic lives. Many teachers have already made savings plans for three to five years. Some plan to save money to buy valuable books, some plan to buy radios, and some plan to accumulate funds for their children's education. Now, more than 90% of the teachers in this school are participating in savings. The Municipal Housing Management Office not only regards helping to arrange the lives of staff as a welfare work, but also as a political and ideological work of the Party and the administration. Director Long of the management office has spoken to the staff on many occasions about planning expenditures, saving money, so as to support national construction and improve personal and family life. Before last year, many employees of this office spent money without a plan and owed a large amount of administrative loans. Since the leadership attached importance to helping everyone arrange their lives, not only did they no longer have to borrow money from the administration, but many people also had savings. In the past, Yu Linzhou always spent more than 60 yuan a month before the end of the month, and life was very difficult. Later, after the leadership helped him arrange his life and plan his expenses, he had surplus money every month and also deposited money in the bank. Therefore, his work is also more active than before.

    通化市部分机关学校领导人
    帮助工作人员计划收支改善生活
    本报讯　吉林通化市部分机关、学校的党、政、工会领导人员经常注意帮助工作人员安排生活，计划开支，改善生活。如房产管理所、朝鲜中学等机关学校，把这一工作列入行政工作计划，并且设有专人负责。朝鲜中学校长经常结合各种重大报告号召教职员计划开支，节约储蓄。去年暑期，学校教师都提前发了两个月工资，校长动员他们只留下半个月的工资，其他多余的或暂时不用的钱都存入银行。最近他们学校领导上还责成工会负责人李宗骥深入教职员中帮助安排经济生活，有不少的教师已订出了三年到五年的节约储蓄计划，有的准备存钱买贵重的书籍，有的准备买收音机，也有的准备积蓄子女教育费。现在这个学校参加储蓄的教师已有90％以上。市房产管理所不仅把帮助安排工作人员生活作为生活福利工作，而且作为党和行政的政治思想工作。管理所龙主任曾在很多场合向工作人员讲计划开支，节约储蓄，以支援国家建设和改善个人家庭生活的道理。去年以前，这个所的许多职工用钱没计划，欠下了大笔行政借款，自从领导上重视了帮助大家安排生活的工作以后，不但不再要向行政上借钱了，而且很多人有了积蓄。于林洲过去一个人每月六十多元钱总是不到月底就花光了，生活很感困难。后来经过领导上帮助他安排生活，计划开支，月月有了余钱，在银行还存了款。因此，他的工作也比从前更积极了。　　　　（罗绳武）
