    Pulan Zong Under the Himalayas
    Ni Qian
    It was August in the Ali grassland of western Tibet, when the weather was sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy. I followed the representatives of the Third Sub-Delegation of the Central Delegation from Gar Kunsha to Pulan Zong under the Himalayas. After passing the southwesternmost ridge of the Gangdise water system, we saw the towering rock peaks and snow ridges of the Himalayas. In the deep valley under the snow mountains, the Peacock River shimmered with silver-gray waves. The fields on both sides were green, and villages faced each other. Around some villages' houses, tall willow trees provided lush shade. After days of travel in the high-altitude grassland, arriving suddenly in this valley less than 4,000 meters above sea level felt like going from the northern border to southern China.
    Pulan Zong is the only purely agricultural area with a mild climate on the Ali grassland. Currently, the highland barley and barley ears are beginning to ripen, and plump bean pods are growing on the pea vines. Every morning, when scarlet clouds echoed among the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, Tibetan farm women in red and green skirts began to weed and irrigate the fields. In the evening, the setting sun shone on the crisscrossing canals, emitting glittering golden light, and children whistled, driving cattle and sheep from the mountain slopes towards their farmhouses.
    Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Pulan Zong in 1952 helped local Tibetan farmers repair canals, reclaim land for production, and issue interest-free agricultural loans every year, this agricultural area, which was originally declining, has gradually prospered again. Over the years, the land along the Peacock River has increased. In addition to the soldiers reclaiming hundreds of acres of land, Tibetan farmers have also opened up many small plots. Both the year before last and last year, the valley had a bumper harvest, and this year is also a good year.
    Pulan Zong is located at the confluence of two rivers along the Peacock River. A tributary originating from the Himalayas flows into the Peacock River here. On the high mountains on the river bank, the red and white ancient castle-style buildings of the Zong government and monasteries are distributed. Below the mountains is the famous Pulan Zong market. This market is one of the larger markets in the Ali area, but people only trade here in summer and autumn. The 1954 agreement between the Chinese government and the Indian government on trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India stipulated that this place is one of the trade markets. These days, the tent shops of Indian merchants trading here have formed a street market on the high platform of the river bank, and bags of salt carried by yaks from the herders are piled up on the beach. During the day, bustling crowds conduct transactions, and at night, lights shine on the river bank. This market used to be very desolate, but in recent years, because social order is stable, the transaction volume of the market has increased significantly. During the four to five months of the trade period each year, the traded salt, grain, wool, and daily necessities reach hundreds of thousands to one million sheep-loads (each sheep-load is more than twenty catties). The trade team sent here by the Ali Branch of the State-owned Tibet Trading General Company has recently supplied many tea leaves and grains to the herders at low prices. The Ali Branch of the People's Bank of China has also set up a team here and opened commercial remittances.
    Near the market, the school building of Pulan Zong Elementary School, which can accommodate one to two hundred children, is under construction, and more than ten classrooms with sufficient light and teachers' dormitories have been completed. This beautiful place under the Himalayas, which is sung by the Tibetan people, is about to become an economically and culturally developed place on the Ali grassland.

    喜马拉雅山下的普兰宗
    倪潜
    正是西藏高原西部阿里草原时晴时雨的八月，我随中央代表团第三分团的代表们从噶尔昆沙到了喜马拉雅山下的普兰宗。走过冈底斯水脉最西南面的一道山岭，便见到了喜马拉雅巍峨的重重岩峰雪岭，雪山下的深谷中，孔雀河泛着银灰色的波浪，两岸田野碧绿，村落相望，有些村子的房舍周围，高大的柳树绿荫葱笼。在高寒草原上经过多日旅途生活之后，突然来到这拔海不到四千公尺的山谷中，真像从塞北到了江南。
    普兰宗是阿里草原上仅有的气候温和的纯农业区。目前青稞、大麦穗子开始黄熟，豌豆秧上结着肥硕的豆荚。每天清晨，当绯红的云带在喜马拉雅积雪的群峰中回荡的时候，穿着红绿衫裙的藏族农妇便开始在田里拔草灌水；傍晚，夕阳照得纵横的水渠发出点点金光，孩子们吹着口哨，赶着牛羊，从山坡走向农舍。
    自从1952年进驻普兰宗的中国人民解放军帮助当地藏族农民修复水渠，开荒生产，并且年年发放无息农贷以来，这个原来走向雕敝的农业区又逐步兴旺起来了。几年来，孔雀河畔的田地增加了，除了战士们开垦了数百亩田地外，藏族农民也开了许多小块的田地。前年和去年，河谷里都获得丰收，今年也是好年景。
    普兰宗位于孔雀河边两条河流的汇合处，发源于喜马拉雅山脉的一条支流在这里注入孔雀河。在河岸高高的山头上，分布着宗政府和寺院的红色和白色的古城堡式的建筑。山下便是有名的普兰宗市场，这个市场是阿里地区较大的市场之一，但人们只有夏季和秋季才在这里贸易。1954年我国政府和印度政府签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中，规定这里为贸易市场之一。这些日子，在这里进行贸易的印度商人的帐篷商店，在河岸高台地上形成了街市，牧民们用羊子驮来的盐袋在沙滩上堆成了堆。白天，熙熙攘攘的人们进行着交易，夜晚，河岸上发出点点灯光。这个市场从前很萧条，但是最近几年来，因为社会秩序安定，市场的交易额显著地增加了，在每年四五个月的贸易期中，成交的食盐、粮食、羊毛和日用品达数十万到一百万羊驮（每羊驮二十多斤）。国营西藏贸易总公司阿里分公司派到这里的贸易小组，最近向牧民低价供应了许多茶叶和粮食。中国人民银行阿里分行也在这里设了小组，开放了商业汇兑。
    在市场附近，能容纳一二百名儿童的普兰宗小学的校舍正在建筑，十多间光线充足的教室和教员宿舍已经落成。这个被藏族人民歌唱的喜马拉雅山下的美好的地方，即将成为阿里草原上经济、文化发达的地方。
