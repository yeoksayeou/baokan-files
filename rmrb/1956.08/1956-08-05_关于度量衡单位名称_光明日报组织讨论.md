    Regarding the nomenclature of units of weights and measures, *Guangming Daily* is organizing a discussion. Unifying the nomenclature of units of weights and measures in our country is a relatively complex issue, and it is also an issue closely related to the lives of the people. In our country, it has not been thoroughly resolved for decades. Until now, the "gong" system of names and the metric system of names are still popular, causing a lot of inconvenience and confusion. The National Bureau of Metrology has conducted some investigation and research on the issue of unifying the names of units of measurement for more than a year, and has drafted a plan for unifying the names of units of weights and measures nationwide. At the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, Delegate Li Chenggan (Director of the National Bureau of Metrology) made a speech on this issue, introducing the spirit of the plan. However, many people, especially scientists and technicians, believe that this plan is still open to discussion, and they have put forward some different views. Starting from the fourth of this month, *Guangming Daily* will successively publish opinions from all parties on this issue and conduct discussions for the reference of relevant departments, so as to absorb useful opinions from all parties and make this plan more perfect.

    关于度量衡单位名称
    光明日报组织讨论
    本报讯　光明日报开展关于度量衡单位名称的讨论。统一我国度量衡单位名称是一个比较复杂的问题，也是和人民生活密切有关的问题。在我国，几十年来还没有获得彻底解决，直到现在，还流行着“公”字系统的名称和米突制的名称，造成很多不便和混乱。国家计量局对统一度量单位名称问题，一年多以来作了一些调查研究工作，并拟订了统一全国度量衡单位名称的方案。在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，李承干代表（国家计量局局长）对这一问题作了发言，介绍了方案的精神。但是许多人，特别是科学工作者和技术人员认为这一方案尚有商榷之处，他们提出了一些不同的看法。光明日报从本月四日起陆续发表各方面对这个问题的意见，进行讨论，供有关部门参考，以便吸取各方面有益的意见，把这方案拟订得更趋完善。
