    Shenyang-produced civilian goods are beginning to be welcomed by users. This is a new phenomenon that has emerged after twenty-two local state-owned factories in Shenyang learned advanced experiences from brother factories in Shanghai.

    The Shenyang Qidong Cotton Weaving Factory learned the operational experience of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 and State-owned Cotton Factory No. 19. The seersucker produced can withstand long-term washing and ironing, eliminating the shortcoming of past seersucker not having "bubbles." It is now very popular on the market. After Shenyang's rubber shoe factories learned the Shanghai low-temperature rubber mixing method, the rubber surface of the rubber shoes produced is very shiny, and the phenomenon of wrinkles on the toe has also been changed. The wooden beds produced by the Shenyang Wood Factory are also very sturdy and beautiful. They can be freely disassembled and assembled when they need to be moved, and do not affect the degree of solidity. Due to learning the advanced experience of Shanghai brother factories, the product quality of the Shenyang Enamel Factory has now been rated as second in the country.

    In order to change the situation of poor product quality, twenty-two local industrial factories in Shenyang (including heating and plumbing equipment, textiles, rubber shoes, wood products, printing, pharmaceuticals, cultural and educational supplies, glass instruments, and aluminum manufacturing industries) sent factory directors, section chiefs, technicians, workshop directors, and workers to Shanghai brother factories in the second quarter to learn advanced experience in various aspects and establish friendly connections. After returning to Shenyang in June, many factories established advanced experience promotion groups, summarized the advanced experience they had learned, formulated promotion plans, and helped workers gradually master the advanced experience of improving product quality according to technical data.

    学习上海兄弟企业的先进经验
    沈阳地方工业产品受到用户欢迎
    据新华社讯　沈阳市生产的民用品开始受到用户欢迎。这是沈阳二十二个地方国营工厂学习了上海兄弟厂的先进经验以后，呈现的新气象。
    沈阳市启东棉织厂学习了上海国棉一厂和国棉十九厂的操作经验，生产的泡泡纱能经受长期洗涤和熨烫，消除了过去泡泡纱没有泡的缺点，现在在市面上很受欢迎。沈阳市各胶鞋厂学习上海低温炼胶法以后，生产的胶鞋胶面非常光亮，鞋头也改变了有皱折的现象。沈阳市木器厂生产的木床，也非常结实、美观，需要搬动的时候可以自由拆拼，而且不影响牢固程度。沈阳市搪瓷厂由于学习上海兄弟厂的先进经验，现在产品质量已经被评为全国第二位。
    沈阳二十二个地方工业工厂（包括水暖器材、纺织、胶鞋、木器、印刷、制药、文教用品、玻璃仪器和制铝等行业），为了改变产品质量低劣的局面，在第二季度曾经派出厂长、科长、技术人员、车间主任和工人，去上海各兄弟厂学习各方面的先进经验，并且建立了友谊联系。六月份回沈阳之后，很多工厂成立了先进经验推广组，总结了所学来的先进经验，制订了推广的规划，并且按着技术资料帮助工人逐步掌握了提高产品质量的先进经验。
