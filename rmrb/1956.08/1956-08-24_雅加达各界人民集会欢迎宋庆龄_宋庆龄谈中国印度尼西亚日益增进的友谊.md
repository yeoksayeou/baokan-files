Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 23rd: People from all walks of life in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, held a mass rally at the stadium on the evening of August 22nd to welcome Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China.

In her speech to Indonesian friends (full text on pages five and six), Soong Ching Ling pointed out that the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people is growing day by day. She said that in recent years, we have raised the friendship between our two countries and peoples to a higher level. As newly independent countries, our fundamental interests are more aligned today than ever before. Many of the problems we face are fundamentally the same. At home, our main task is to eliminate our backwardness and improve the lives of our people. In foreign affairs, our main task is to strive for friendly cooperation between countries and for peace in Asia and the world. In striving for harmonious relations, we have only one condition: that others treat us as equals and recognize our political and national independence. Because our two young countries, like other Asian and African countries, face the same problems, the deeper our friendship, the more we can learn from each other, the more we can exchange, and the greater the support we can give each other. Our history and our times demand close cooperation.

The stadium was filled with a friendly atmosphere. The Indonesian and Chinese flags were hung on the stage. On both sides of the stage were pictures of two large hands shaking. When Soong Ching Ling arrived at seven o'clock, Jakarta Mayor Sudiro greeted her at the door. Sitting on the stage with Soong Ching Ling were National Assembly Chairman Sadono and his wife, Sudiro and his wife, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen and his wife, and others.

In his speech, Mayor Sudiro said that Soong Ching Ling was welcomed in Jakarta by friends and brothers fighting against imperialism, colonialism, feudalism, and capitalism. He pointed out that Soong Ching Ling's work "Struggle for a New China" is well known among the Indonesian people. The Mayor said that the Indonesian people's revolution, which began in 1945, has not yet been completed, and Soong Ching Ling's forty years of struggle experience may be useful to the Indonesian people.

About two thousand people from all walks of life in the capital attended the rally. When Soong Ching Ling was speaking, thousands more were listening outside the stadium.

After Soong Ching Ling's speech, Mayor Sudiro presented her with gifts on behalf of the citizens of Jakarta. He said that he believed that Soong Ching Ling's speech would greatly strengthen the friendly ties between the people of Indonesia and China, as well as between Beijing and Jakarta.

    雅加达各界人民集会欢迎宋庆龄
    宋庆龄谈中国印度尼西亚日益增进的友谊
    据新华社雅加达23日电　印度尼西亚首都雅加达各界人民八月二十二日晚上在体育馆举行民众集会，欢迎中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄。
    宋庆龄向印度尼西亚朋友们讲话（全文见第五、六版）时指出，中国和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊正在日益增长。她说，在最近几年内，我们已经把我们两国和两国人民之间的友谊提到更高的水平。作为新近得到独立的国家，我们的根本利益今天较以往任何时期更为一致。我们所面对的许多问题在基本的方面是相同的。在国内，我们面对的主要任务是消灭我们的落后状态，改善我们人民的生活。在对外事务方面，我们的主要任务是争取各国之间的友好合作，争取亚洲和世界的和平。在争取建立和谐的关系方面，我们只有一个条件，那就是，别人平等对待我们，承认我们的政治和民族独立。由于我们两个年青的国家，同其他亚非国家一样，都面对着同样的问题，我们之间的友谊越深，我们可以相互学到的东西就越多，我们可以交流的东西就越多，我们可以相互给予的支持就越大。我们的历史和我们的时代要求我们进行密切的合作。
    体育馆里充满着友好气氛。台上悬挂着印度尼西亚和中国的国旗。台的左右两侧挂着两支大手在握手的图画。当宋庆龄在七点钟到达的时候，雅加达市长苏迪罗在门口迎接她。同宋庆龄一起坐在台上的有国会议长沙多诺和夫人、苏迪罗和夫人、中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和夫人等。
    苏迪罗市长在讲话中说，宋庆龄在雅加达受到为反对帝国主义、殖民主义、封建主义和资本主义而战的朋友们和兄弟们的欢迎。他指出，宋庆龄的作品“为新中国奋斗”，在印度尼西亚人民中间是大家都知道的。市长说，在1945年开始的印度尼西亚人民的革命还没有完成，而宋庆龄四十年的斗争经验对印度尼西亚人民可能有用。
    参加集会的有来自首都各阶层的约两千人。当宋庆龄在讲话的时候，还有成千的人在体育馆外面倾听着。
    宋庆龄讲话后，苏迪罗市长代表雅加达市民向她赠送礼品。他说，他认为宋庆龄的这篇讲话将大大加强印度尼西亚和中国两国人民之间以及北京和雅加达之间的友好联系。
