Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 16th (by Xinhua reporter Lü Xinchu): The symposium on genetics held in Qingdao has discussed the question of whether asexual hybridization (grafting) can produce hybrids in the three days since the 14th.

The experimental data on asexual hybridization producing hybrids is an important argument for the Michurin school in criticizing the chromosome theory of the Mendel-Morgan school. This is because grafting is the combination of tissues of the stock and scion, unlike sexual hybridization which is the combination of cell nuclei. Therefore, after grafting, the chromosomes in the cell nuclei are not transmitted. The Michurin school believes that grafting can produce hybrids, which shows that chromosomes are not genetic material (or rather, not the main genetic material).

Zu Deming, Deputy Director and Geneticist of the North China Agricultural Science Institute, cited tomato grafting experiments conducted by Soviet biologist Grushchenko and eggplant grafting experiments conducted by Zu Deming himself, which proved that asexual hybridization can produce hybrids. He said that the results of asexual hybridization experiments by other scientists in China and scientists in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Japan, and other countries also proved this fact. Zu Deming said that some people's grafting experiments were unsuccessful because their methods were not correct.

Wang Zhongyan, Professor and expert in genetic breeding at South China Agricultural College, also cited his own two-year example of grafting moonflowers onto sweet potatoes. He said that according to preliminary observations, grafting can obtain hybrids. Sweet potatoes grafted with moonflowers produced offspring with new traits. He has now observed the second generation, and the yield of the second generation sweet potatoes is generally 20% to 30% higher than that of ungrafted sweet potatoes.

However, Wu Zhongxian, Professor and Geneticist at Beijing Agricultural University, believes that asexual hybridization cannot produce hybrids. He said that the materials, methods, and analysis of results used in the grafting experiments conducted by Grushchenko and Zu Deming had problems. The changes in traits after grafting were not the result of grafting, but other reasons. For example, if the materials used are not purebred, then even without grafting, the traits of their offspring may change. He said that a biological hybrid must have the dual traits of both parents and be able to be inherited. He believes that what is obtained by grafting is a "chimera" – a combination of the tissues of two organisms, but this situation cannot be inherited, and its offspring cannot remain "chimeras."

Li Shuxuan, Professor and Horticulture Expert at Zhejiang Agricultural College, believes that believing that asexual hybridization can produce hybrids does not mean denying that chromosomes are genetic material. He said that most plants do not easily produce asexual hybrids (hybrids produced by asexual hybridization), so it cannot be considered a universal law. At the same time, the fact of a few asexual hybridizations cannot be used to overthrow the chromosome theory that has been proven by more facts.

Some experts believe that more in-depth research experiments are needed to explore the principles of these issues.

### 在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会  讨论无性杂交能否产生杂种问题

    在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会
    讨论无性杂交能否产生杂种问题
    新华社青岛16日电　新华社记者吕新初报道：在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会，从十四日以来的三天中讨论了无性杂交（嫁接）能不能产生杂种的问题。
    无性杂交产生杂种的实验资料，是米丘林学派批判孟德尔、摩尔根学派的染色体学说的重要论据，因为嫁接是砧木和接穗的组织的结合，不像有性杂交那样是细胞核的结合，所以嫁接以后，在细胞核中的染色体并没有传递。米丘林学派认为，嫁接能产生杂种，就说明染色体不是遗传物质（或者说不是主要的遗传物质）。
    华北农业科学研究所副所长、遗传学家祖德明举出，苏联生物学家格鲁森科作的番茄嫁接实验和祖德明自己作的茄子嫁接实验，证明无性杂交可以产生杂种。他说，国内其他科学家和保加利亚、南斯拉夫、日本等国科学家实验无性杂交的结果，同样证明了这个事实。祖德明说，有些人作嫁接实验没有成功，是由于他们的方法不对头。
    华南农学院教授、遗传选种专家王仲彦也举出他自己进行了两年的月光花嫁接甘薯的例子。他说，根据初步的观察，嫁接是可以获得杂种的。他用月光花嫁接以后的甘薯产出了具有新性状的后代。现在他已观察到第二代，第二代的甘薯一般比没有嫁接的甘薯产量高20％到30％。
    但是，北京农业大学教授、遗传学家吴仲贤认为无性杂交不能产生杂种。他说，格鲁森科和祖德明等作的嫁接实验所采用的材料、方法以及对结果的分析都有问题，嫁接以后产生性状的变化，不是嫁接的结果，而是其他的原因。比如采用的材料不是纯种，那末即使不通过嫁接，他的后代的性状也可能有变化。他说，生物学的杂种，必须是具有双亲的双重性状，并且要能遗传下去。他认为嫁接得到的是“嵌合体”——两个生物体的组织的拼合，但这种情况不能遗传下去，他的后代不可能仍旧是“嵌合体”。
    浙江农学院教授、园艺专家李曙轩的看法是：相信无性杂交可以产生杂种，不等于否认染色体是遗传物质。他说，大多数的植物不容易产生无性杂种（无性杂交产生的杂种），所以还不能认为这是一个普遍的规律，同时也不能用少数无性杂交的事实来推翻已经用更多事实证明了的染色体学说。
    有些专家认为：对于这些问题，还需要作更多更深入的研究实验，才能探明原理。
