A deputy manager of a joint state-private department store wrote a letter saying: "The state representative and I are too courteous with each other. When he speaks to me, I stand up; when I speak to him, he stands up." The letter also stated that he had difficulty getting involved in many matters, and spent his days wandering around, expressing some frustration in his words.

Courtesy is originally a manifestation of mutual respect and a traditional virtue of the Chinese people, and should be beyond reproach. However, the "courtesy" reflected by this deputy manager is not this kind of courtesy. Otherwise, why would "frustration be hidden" behind the "courtesy"? If people are together all day, and are always so polite, can this continue for long? What is the meaning of "unable to get involved"? Let's tentatively surmise that the state representative may be wary of the private personnel, while the private personnel lack sufficient initiative!

I have heard people say that after the joint state-private operation of enterprises, some state representatives are afraid that contacting private personnel will cause them to lose their standpoint; some private personnel are afraid that excessive words and deeds will lead to mistakes. Therefore, both parties are polite and keep a respectful distance from each other, but behind their backs they all have some complaints. Here, the word "fear" does not contain any positive factors. It is honorable for capitalists to gradually transform from exploiters to laborers, so what is there to be afraid of? They should exert their strength, work hard to participate in production and management, and achieve results. For state personnel, they should fully recognize that the acceptance of socialist transformation by capitalists is a great force for construction, and it is the state personnel's unshirkable task to unite and educate them. Some people are afraid that they will be "transformed" by the capitalists; are they afraid of others, or are they afraid of themselves? What is the reason for being so afraid of oneself?

Mutual respect is necessary, but its foundation should be frankness and sincerity. Only in this way can we improve the working relationship in joint state-private enterprises; and when the working relationship is improved, it signifies that the production and management level of joint state-private enterprises has taken a big step forward.

### 谈“客气”

    谈“客气”
    林晰
    一家公私合营百货商店的副经理来信说：“公方代表和我之间太客气了。他对我说话，我站起来；我对他说话，他站起来。”这封信里还说，他有许多事情插不上手，每天只得游游荡荡，言语之间流露了一些苦闷的情绪。
    客气原是互相尊重的表现，也是我国人民传统的美德，应该无可非议。但是，这位副经理反映的“客气”，却不是这种客气。不然，为什么还会在“客气”的后面“隐藏着苦闷呢”？终日相处而终日如此彬彬有礼，能够长此下去吗？“插不上手”又是怎么回事？姑且估断一下，大概是公方代表对私方人员存着某种戒心，而私方人员又缺乏足够的主动性吧！
    听见有人说，企业公私合营以后，有些公方代表害怕同私方人员接触会丧失立场；有些私方人员则害怕自己言行过分会犯错误。因此双方客客气气，互相敬而远之，背后却都有些牢骚。在这里，
  “怕”字里面不包含任何积极的因素。资本家从剥削者逐步转变成劳动者很光荣，有什么可怕的呢？他们理当发挥自己的力量，努力参加生产和经营管理工作，并且作出成绩来。对公方人员来说，应该充分认识到资本家接受社会主义改造对建设事业是个很大的力量，对他们进行团结和教育是公方人员义不容辞的任务。有些人害怕自己会被资本家“改造”了；这是怕别人呢，还是怕自己呢？这样害怕自己，那是什么道理？
    互相尊重是需要的，但它的基础应当是坦率和真诚。只有这样，才能搞好公私合营企业中的共事关系；而共事关系搞好了，就标志着公私合营企业的生产和管理水平向前大大地迈进了一步。
