Xinhua News Agency, Baise, 7th — In the remote mountainous areas of Longlin, Bama, Mubiān and other areas of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province, more than 400 single-ethnic agricultural cooperatives and multi-ethnic joint cooperatives have established new accounting systems with the help of Han Chinese youths who came to support them.

After the Zhuang, Yao, Miao and other minority farmers in the remote western mountainous areas of the autonomous prefecture established agricultural cooperatives, they generally lacked accountants. Some cooperatives used iron bars to punch holes in cardboard to record accounts, or used beans to represent points, resulting in many errors and omissions, and very messy accounts. Just as the cooperative members were worried that the agricultural cooperatives would be difficult to consolidate, more than 490 Han Chinese youths from Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuzhou and Rongxian Special District voluntarily signed up to provide support. They were assigned to the agricultural cooperatives that were most difficult to consolidate to work as accountants, chief accountants, or accounting instructors for the district. In the past few months, they patiently sorted out the old accounts and spread new bookkeeping methods. The Yangsuo Ethnic Joint Cooperative in Longlin Autonomous County had not cleared its work points for four or five months due to the lack of an accountant. After Liu Yuanhua, a young Han Chinese woman, was assigned to this cooperative, she climbed mountains and ridges day and night to check accounts in all 27 production teams of the cooperative, and helped the work-point recorders record work. In less than 20 days, she cleared the cooperative's work points for five months. Lü Jingxia, who was assigned to Fengshan County, cleaned up the old accounts of the agricultural cooperative and announced the new accounts to the members every month.

Many of these young Han Chinese accountants also serve as literacy teachers in agricultural cooperatives, helping members learn to read, do abacus calculations, and register work points. At the same time, many young Han Chinese accountants have also learned the languages of minority nationalities from local farmers.

    桂西僮族自治州汉族青年
    帮助少数民族社建立会计制度
    新华社百色7日电　广西省桂西僮族自治州隆林、巴马、睦边等边远山区的四百多个单一民族农业社和多民族联合社，在前来支援的汉族青年的帮助下建立了新的会计制度。
    自治州西部边远山区的僮、瑶、苗等少数民族农民建立农业社后，普遍缺乏会计。有些社记账时用铁条把硬纸穿洞记算，或用豆代替记分，因此错漏很多，账目很乱。正当社员们担心农业社难以巩固的时候，桂林、柳州、南宁、梧州四市和容县专区等地有四百九十多名汉族青年志愿报名前来支援。他们被分配到最难巩固的农业社里做会计、会计主任或区的会计辅导员。几个月来，他们耐心地整理了旧账目，传播了新记账方法。隆林各族自治县央索民族联合社由于没有会计，四五个月的工分都没有清理过。汉族女青年刘媛华分配到这个社后，不论白天黑夜，爬山越岭到全社二十七个生产队去查账，帮记分员记工，不到二十天，就把全社五个月的工分清理清楚。分配到凤山县的吕静霞，把农业社的旧账清理好，每月把新账向社员公布。
    这些汉族青年会计，很多人还担任农业社的扫盲教师，帮助社员学文化、打算盘、登记工分等。同时不少汉族青年会计还向当地农民学会了少数民族语言。
