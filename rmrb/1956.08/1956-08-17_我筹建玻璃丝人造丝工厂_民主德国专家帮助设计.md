Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 14th -- Experts in man-made fibers from the German Democratic Republic are stepping up their design work for the glass fiber factory and rayon factory that China is preparing to build.

Wilke, the technical deputy director of the Engels Man-Made Fiber Factory, who is in charge of the design work for these two factories, told reporters: Experts from the German Democratic Republic are rushing to complete the preliminary design in Karl-Marx-Stadt based on the materials from the on-the-spot surveys in Beijing and Baoding, where the factories are located. The preliminary design will be completed by the end of October this year, and the complete design will be completed by the end of March next year, to ensure that the glass fiber factory and rayon factory officially start production in 1958.

After these two factories are completed, their equipment technology and production methods will reach the most advanced level in the world. The glass fiber factory will produce more than 300 tons of glass fiber annually, and the rayon factory will produce tens of thousands of tons of rayon annually. These man-made fibers can not only be made into colorful glass fiber and rayon clothing, socks, shirts, and scarves of various patterns, but also into beautiful necklaces, bead bracelets, handbags, and durable curtains, tablecloths, and carpets.

    我筹建玻璃丝人造丝工厂
    民主德国专家帮助设计
    新华社柏林14日电　民主德国的人造纤维专家们正在为中国筹备建立的玻璃丝工厂和人造丝工厂加紧进行设计工作。
    负责这两个厂的设计工作的恩格斯人造纤维工厂技术副厂长威尔克告诉记者说：民主德国的专家们正在卡尔·马克思斯塔特根据在工厂所在的北京和保定实地勘测的材料赶制初步设计。初步设计将在今年十月底作好，全部设计要在明年三月底完成，以保证玻璃丝工厂和人造丝工厂在1958年正式开始生产。
    这两个厂建成后，它们的设备技术和生产方法都将达到世界最先进的水平。玻璃丝工厂将年产玻璃丝三百吨以上，人造丝工厂年产上万吨的人造丝。这些人造纤维不但可以制成五光十色各种花样的玻璃丝和人造丝衣料、袜子、衬衣、围巾，还可以制成美丽动人的项练、珠镯皮包和持久耐用的窗帘、桌布和地毯。
