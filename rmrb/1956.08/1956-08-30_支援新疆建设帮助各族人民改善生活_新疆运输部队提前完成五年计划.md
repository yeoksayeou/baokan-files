    Supporting Xinjiang's Construction and Helping People of All Ethnic Groups Improve Their Lives
    Xinjiang Transportation Troops Complete Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Our Urumqi Dispatch) The Transportation Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps completed its first Five-Year Plan on August 20, one year, four months, and ten days ahead of schedule. In three years and seven months, they completed a total of 634.7 million ton-kilometers of transportation tasks, created over 180 million yuan in wealth, and turned over nearly 40 million yuan in net profit to the state.
    In Xinjiang, with its vast territory and inconvenient transportation, the Transportation Corps of the Production and Construction Corps is a powerful transportation force. In recent years, this transportation corps has transported large quantities of steel, cement, machinery, and factory equipment, as well as various materials and daily necessities, from within the country and the Sino-Soviet border, strongly supporting Xinjiang's economic construction and promoting the improvement of the material and cultural life of people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, it has also accumulated a large amount of funds for the Production and Construction Corps to develop water conservancy and farm construction.
    In recent years, this transportation corps has attached importance to promoting advanced experience, and while completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, it has also saved a large amount of fuel. From last year to June of this year, a total of 1,175.5 tons of gasoline were saved according to the prescribed fuel consumption, and together with other savings, the total cost was reduced by 16% in three and a half years. This year, in carrying out the "Safety, Saving, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" campaign, the experience of Su Changfu's safe, economical driving of 250,000 kilometers without major overhaul and An Guodong's tire maintenance experience were promoted. In the first half of the year, the funds saved from tires alone could buy back 581 sets of domestically produced (900-20) tires. Units such as the Sixth Company of the First Detachment and the First Brigade, which were relatively backward in production in the past, have also caught up with the level of advanced units this year.
    From August 20 to 25, this transportation corps held a political work conference to summarize the experience of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and formulated new measures to strive for better completion of new transportation tasks.

    支援新疆建设帮助各族人民改善生活
    新疆运输部队提前完成五年计划
    本报乌鲁木齐电　新疆军区生产建设兵团运输部队在8月20日提前一年四个月零十天完成了第一个五年计划。他们在三年又七个多月中，共完成了六亿三千四百七十多万吨公里的运输任务，创造了一亿八千多万元的财富，上缴给国家的纯利润将近四千万元。
    生产建设兵团运输部队在地区辽阔、交通不便的新疆，是一支强大的运输力量。几年来，这支运输部队从关内和中苏边境运进了大批的钢材、水泥、机器和工厂设备，以及各种物资和生活用品等，有力地支援了新疆的经济建设，促进了各族人民物质文化生活的改善。同时，也为生产建设兵团发展水利和农场建设，积累了很大一笔资金。
    几年来，这支运输部队由于重视了推广先进经验，在提前完成五年计划的同时，还节约了大量油料。从去年到今年六月，按照规定的耗油量，共节省了汽油一千一百七十五吨半，连同其他节约累计起来，三年半降低了总成本16％。今年在开展“安全、节约、行驶十万公里无大修”的运动中，推广了苏长福安全、节约、行驶二十五万公里无大修的经验和安国栋保养轮胎的经验等，上半年光轮胎一项的节约资金，就可买回（900—20）国产胎五百八十一套。过去生产上比较落后的一支队、一大队的六中队等单位，今年也赶上了先进单位的水平。
    这支运输部队在8月20日至25日，召开政治工作会议，总结了这次提前完成五年计划的经验，并且制定了新的措施，力争更好地完成新的运输任务。
