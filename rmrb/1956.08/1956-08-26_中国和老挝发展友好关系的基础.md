These days, our people have been enthusiastically and happily welcoming the distinguished guests of the Lao Royal Government delegation on their friendly visit to our country. The leaders of the Chinese and Lao governments have also held sincere and friendly talks. Based on the completely unanimous agreements reached during the talks, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Phouma have signed a joint statement, which lays the foundation for developing friendly relations between our two countries.

This joint statement indicates that the visit of the Lao Royal Government delegation to our country and the talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Lao governments have deepened the mutual understanding between our two countries, further affirmed the common desire of both countries to maintain peace and mutual respect, and defined the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries. In his speeches in our country, Prime Minister Phouma has repeatedly emphasized the position of the Kingdom of Laos in pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality and supporting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and expressed the willingness of the Kingdom of Laos to develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with our country. The position and desire of the Kingdom of Laos have made a deep impression on the people of our country. On the other hand, the Chinese people's full commitment to peaceful construction, their determination to maintain peace, their adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and their deep desire to develop friendly relations with all countries, especially Asian countries, are also easily understood by the distinguished guests of the Kingdom of Laos in their extensive contacts within our country. Based on this beneficial mutual understanding, the friendship between our two countries has been further developed, and common demands and aspirations have become clearer. Therefore, in the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Phouma, the Lao Royal Government explicitly declared that it "resolutely implements a policy of peace and neutrality." At the same time, the two governments reached a completely unanimous agreement on observing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and developing good-neighborly relations. The Chinese people express a warm welcome and firm support for these agreements reached by the Chinese and Lao governments. We firmly believe that, due to the signing of these agreements, the long-standing traditional friendship between China and Laos has not only been restored, but has also been placed on a brand-new foundation, making it more vital and having broad prospects for full development. Certain people who attempt to create artificial factors to harm the relations between China and Laos and hinder the trend of peaceful coexistence will be greatly disappointed. The agreements between the Chinese and Lao governments fully conform to the interests of the people of both countries, and are also conducive to promoting the continued relaxation of the international situation and maintaining the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

The agreement in the joint statement on developing economic and cultural cooperation between China and Laos is also of great significance. Our two countries are geographically adjacent neighbors, have a tradition of mutual cooperation in history, and one of the common problems currently facing us is to commit ourselves to getting rid of the scourges left by the colonialists and developing our own economic and cultural construction. These many factors determine the necessity and possibility of developing economic and cultural relations between our two countries. In recent years, especially since the Bandung Conference, the development of economic and cultural cooperative relations among Asian and African countries has been playing an increasingly significant role in consolidating the independence of Asian and African countries, promoting the construction of Asian and African countries, and enhancing mutual solidarity. There is no doubt that, taking this agreement as a starting point, the economic and cultural relations between China and Laos will become increasingly close, thereby bringing benefits to the people of both countries.

As a friendly neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the people of our country greatly cherish the friendship of the Lao government and people towards us, and also earnestly hope that the Kingdom of Laos will continue to develop in building its own country. Not long ago, the significant achievements made by Prince Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong in the Vientiane talks received warm congratulations from the people of our country. We believe that, under the new situation of domestic unity and solidarity and the acquisition of more friends internationally, the Kingdom of Laos will increasingly move towards prosperity and strength.

Although the visit of Prince Phouma and the distinguished guests of the Lao Royal Government delegation to our country was not long, the seeds of friendship they left behind will be permanently deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of both countries. The Chinese people will respond to this friendly visit of the Lao Royal Government delegation with practical actions of resolutely abiding by and implementing the various agreements reached between the Chinese and Lao governments, vigorously developing the friendship between the two countries, and jointly committing themselves with the Kingdom of Laos to maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia.

    中国和老挝发展友好关系的基础
    这些天来，我国人民怀着兴奋愉快的心情热烈欢迎老挝王国政府代表团各位贵宾在我国的友好访问。中国和老挝两国政府领导人并举行了诚挚和友好的会谈。根据会谈中所达成完全一致的协议，周恩来总理和富马首相已签署了联合声明，这为发展我们两国之间的友好关系奠定了基础。
    这一联合声明说明，老挝王国政府代表团这次在我国的访问和中国和老挝两国政府领导人的会谈，已经加深了我们两国的相互了解，进一步肯定了两国对于维护和平和互相尊重的共同愿望，并确定了指导两国之间的关系的基本原则。富马首相在我国的历次讲话中，一再强调老挝王国奉行和平中立政策和支持和平共处五项原则的立场，并表示老挝王国愿意和我国发展睦邻友好的关系。老挝王国这种立场和愿望，在我国人民中产生了深刻的印象。在另一方面，我国人民全力从事和平建设，决心维护和平，坚守和平共处的五项原则，热望同所有国家，特别是同亚洲各国发展友好关系的深切愿望，这也是老挝王国的贵宾们在我国境内的广泛接触中所容易了解到的。基于这种有益的相互了解，我们两国之间的友谊进一步发展了，共同的要求和愿望更加明确了。因此，在周恩来总理和富马首相发表的联合声明中，老挝王国政府明确地声明“坚决执行和平中立政策”，同时，两国政府对于遵守和平共处的五项原则和发展睦邻关系也达成了完全一致的协议。中国人民对于中国和老挝两国政府所达成的这些协议，表示热烈的欢迎和坚决的拥护。我们深信，由于这些协议的签订，中老两国之间历史悠久的传统友谊，不仅已经重新恢复了，而且已经被置于一种全新的基础上，使它更加具有生命力，具有充分发展的广阔前途。某些企图制造人为的因素来损害中国和老挝两国之间的关系和阻碍和平共处的时代潮流的人们，必将感到大失所望。中国和老挝两国政府的协议，完全符合两国人民的利益，也有利于促进国际局势的继续和缓和维护亚洲与世界和平的事业。
    联合声明中关于发展中国和老挝两国之间的经济和文化合作的协议，也具有重大的意义。我们两国在地理上是边境毗连的邻邦，在历史上有过相互合作的传统，而在当前所面临的共同问题之一，就是致力于摆脱殖民主义者所遗留下的祸害而各自发展自己的经济和文化建设。这许多因素，决定了我们两国之间发展经济和文化关系的必要和可能。近几年来，特别是万隆会议以来，亚非各国之间经济、文化合作关系的发展，对于巩固亚非各国的独立，促进亚非各国的建设和增进相互之间的团结，正在产生着日益显著的作用。毫无疑问，中国和老挝两国之间以这次协议为起点，在经济和文化关系上必将日益密切起来，从而给两国人民都带来福利。
    作为老挝王国的友好的邻邦，我国人民十分珍视老挝政府和人民对我们的友谊，同时也热望老挝王国在建设自己国家方面不断地得到发展。不久以前，富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王在万象会谈中所取得的重大成就，受到了我国人民热烈的祝贺。我们相信，老挝王国在国内统一团结和在国际上获得更多朋友的新形势下，必将日益走向繁荣和富强。
    富马亲王和老挝王国政府代表团各位贵宾在我国访问的时间虽然不长，但他们所留下的友谊的种子将永久地深植在两国人民的心灵深处。中国人民将以坚决遵守和实现中国和老挝两国政府所达成的各项协议、大力发展两国之间的友谊，并和老挝王国共同致力于维护印度支那和亚洲和平的实际行动，来回答老挝王国政府代表团这次的友好访问。
