Commentary on Current International Affairs:

    The situation arising from Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a complex and acute struggle. This struggle will have a significant impact on the future development of the international situation.

    On July 26, Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which greatly shocked the Western colonial powers.

    Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is completely reasonable and legal, because the canal is located on Egyptian territory. The Suez Canal Company is a company registered in Egypt and is governed by Egyptian law. Egypt's nationalization of an enterprise on its territory is an act within its sovereignty, and other countries have no right to interfere.

    Since the Suez Canal is an international waterway, the Egyptian government, after announcing the nationalization of the canal company, guaranteed the freedom of navigation and actively took measures to ensure that the Suez Canal could better serve international shipping.

    But the colonial powers were unwilling to let the matter rest. Unable to find a reason to oppose the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, they simply shouted and insisted that Egypt was not capable of managing the canal, that Egypt's guarantee of freedom of navigation was unreliable, and demanded so-called "international control" of the canal, attempting to use this sleight of hand to cancel the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, thereby permanently controlling the canal indefinitely. Britain and France clamored particularly loudly, even mobilizing troops and showing a murderous intent to prepare for armed intervention. The United States, on the one hand, supported Britain and France, and on the other hand, put on a "prudent" face, pretending to hope that the issue would not escalate and could be resolved peacefully.

    British and French Appearances Deceptive

    There is a reason why Britain and France are so furious.

    Britain owns 44% of the shares in the Suez Canal Company. This shareholding not only allowed Britain to control the Suez Canal Company, but also brought it huge annual dividends. Now that control and dividends are lost, it is of course very painful. But more importantly, the Suez Canal is the lifeline of this colonial empire. It is an important transportation route for Britain to extract raw materials and oil from Asia and East Africa and to export manufactured goods to these places. Strategically, the Suez Canal Zone was once a huge British military base controlling the Middle East and Africa. Although Britain was forced to withdraw its troops from here, as long as the Suez Canal Company is in its hands, it can still return at any time if the situation requires. The loss of control over the canal company deepens the crisis of the British Empire.

    What Britain is particularly afraid of is the chain reaction that Egypt's actions may cause in Asia and Africa. Britain spent a great deal of effort to resolve the crisis caused by Iran's nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. If Asian and African countries follow Egypt's example and nationalize the enterprises operated there by British monopoly capital, the future of British colonialism will be unimaginable. The victory of Egypt's anti-colonialist struggle will greatly encourage the courage and confidence of the people of the colonial lands of Asia and Africa to fight for independence, and the colonial system will accelerate its collapse. It is this terrifying scene of the setting sun shining on the British Empire that has led the British ruling group to determine to suppress Egypt in order to save its decline.

    France owns 52% of the shares in the Suez Canal Company, more than Britain's share. But what worries France even more than the interest on the shares is the impact of Egypt's actions on Algeria. France fears that the Algerian people, stirred by an even higher tide of anti-colonialism, will more resolutely deal with the French colonialists.

    However, it is not so easy to suppress the Egyptian people by force. Apart from other factors, Britain and France do not have enough strength now. British troops are busy dealing with the people of Asian and African colonies. In order to suppress the Algerian people, France has exhausted its domestic troops, making it even more difficult than Britain. Therefore, it has to rely on Britain, wanting to use Britain's strength to protect France's interests. And Britain itself must rely on the United States. As a Japanese reporter said, France wants to lean on Britain, and Britain wants to lean on the United States. But the United States has its own plans!

    U.S. Faces Dilemma

    This ally of Britain and France has very complicated feelings about Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company. The United States' diplomatic predicament of being caught in a dilemma and being stretched thin has once again been exposed.

    Like Britain, the United States is very hostile to the Egyptian independence movement, because no matter how many methods they have used, the Egyptian government still adheres to its independent, peaceful, and neutral policy. In particular, Egypt's recognition of China has greatly angered the United States. For colonial countries, an independent Egypt appearing in Africa is a serious threat to colonialism. The influence of Egypt's policy of peace and neutrality has caused great difficulties for the United States' plan to piece together an aggressive bloc in the Middle East.

    Therefore, after failing to win over Egypt, the United States wants to find ways to strike at Egypt. Its refusal to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam is to create difficulties for the Egyptian government, so as to eventually subvert this government that it finds disagreeable. The United States wants to use this method of killing one to warn a hundred to suppress the increasingly high tide of the anti-colonial movement and the trend of peace and neutrality that is sweeping the world.

    Although Britain was the hardest hit by Egypt's actions, this action, following the U.S. and Britain's refusal to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam, was, after all, a loud slap in the face of the United States. Although the United States does not have a large interest in the Suez Canal Company, the United States' oil interests in the Middle East are quite large. The impact of Egypt's actions will similarly damage the United States' colonial interests. At the same time, the United States is not oblivious to the strategic value of the Suez Canal. Therefore, the United States also feels that it is necessary to suppress Egypt.

    But if the United States comes out in the open and supports Britain and France's war actions, it will completely expose the true face of American colonialism in front of the whole world. Moreover, in the year of the U.S. election, bringing the American people to the "brink of war" will completely bankrupt the Republican Party's campaign slogan of "peace and prosperity." But not supporting Britain and France is not an option, because in the end, the United States itself is the number one colonial power, and it must oppose the anti-colonial movement. It is this dilemma that makes the United States dare not openly support Britain and France's military threats and put on some conciliatory gestures, but on the other hand, breathes through the same nostril as Britain and France on fundamental issues.

    In the United States' view, when Britain and France are having bad luck in the Middle East and Africa, it is also the most favorable time for the United States to squeeze out Britain and France's influence. If the United States can support Britain and France's demands on the one hand, and pretend not to be unsympathetic to Egypt and the people of the Middle East on the other, and cope with this crisis, the United States may be able to appear as a friend of the Middle East and African people, replacing the positions of Britain and France, old colonialists, who are increasingly resented by the people of this region.

    Behind-the-Scenes Intrigue at the London Conference

    Therefore, when Britain and France urgently asked the United States to discuss ways to deal with Egypt, the United States only sent Assistant Secretary of State Murphy to London. This made Britain and France very dissatisfied. Britain and France are not unaware of the United States' plans, but in this emergency, they have to "drink poison to quench their thirst." In order to obtain the support of the United States, Britain and France put pressure on the United States. Militarily, Britain and France deliberately made a show of force, and threatened that if the United States did not support them, they would "go it alone." This, on the one hand, was intimidating the Egyptian people, and on the other hand, it was also showing the United States its determination to drag it down. At the same time, Britain and France did not forget to inform the United States of the "great righteousness" of the common interests of the colonial countries, and pointed out that the United States also needed the support of Britain and France on many issues - such as obstructing the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations.

    In order to put pressure on Egypt and force it to make concessions, while at the same time coping with Britain and France and showing the "unity" of the colonial countries, the United States announced the freezing of Egyptian government assets in the United States, sent its Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea to conduct "exercises," and Dulles also rushed to London in person. As a result of the London talks, a joint communiqu√© was issued, deciding to invite twenty-four selected countries to hold a meeting in London on August 16 to discuss the issue of "international control" of the Suez Canal. The list of invited countries was drawn up in accordance with the principle of ensuring that the three countries could get majority support at the meeting, so as to enable the meeting to complete the task of rubber-stamping the "international control" plan for the three countries.

    The United States fundamentally agrees with this "international control" plan in its heart, but it does not dare to call for it as openly as Britain and France, and is thus caught in a dilemma. Success in this plan would benefit the United States. It can take the opportunity to intervene and gain control over the Suez Canal, which it has long coveted. However, in doing so, the United States must reveal its true colors as a colonialist in front of the entire world, and the impact may also require "international control" of the Panama Canal, which the United States single-handedly controls. Therefore, when Dulles returned to the United States after the joint communiqu√© was issued, he said that the United States had not assumed any obligation to take any measures in the event that the London conference failed. This sentence was said to the American people, and also to the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people. The United States simultaneously spread the atmosphere of being willing to continue to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam, and repeatedly stated that the Sixth Fleet's actions in the Mediterranean were planned long ago. Not only that, but the United States also reversed Britain and France's practice and ordered American merchant ships to pay tolls to the Suez Canal Company under Egyptian management.

    This attitude of the United States greatly disappointed Britain and France, but there was nothing they could do. On the one hand, they continued to make military threats against Egypt in a tense manner, wanting to force Egypt to come to the London conference, and on the other hand, they actively formulated their wishful "international control" plan, preparing to bring it to the London conference for a vote and passage.

    Colonialists Isolated

    But the development of the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to these three colonial countries. Military threats have not intimidated the Egyptian people, but have aroused the indignation of the people of Asia and Africa and all those in the world with a sense of justice. Arab countries resolutely stand on Egypt's side, and even Iraq and Iran in the Baghdad Pact support Egypt's nationalization actions. The Arab people have also countered Britain, France, and the United States' military threats with counter-threats of sabotaging Middle Eastern oil pipelines and confiscating foreign oil fields. Egypt's western neighbor Libya resolutely opposes Britain's increase in troops in Libya, and announced that it will not allow Britain to use Libya as a route to attack Egypt.

    World opinion also severely condemns Britain, France, and the United States' outdated gunboat policy, believing that this is a threat to world peace. In particular, the people of Asian and African countries, under the illumination of the Bandung spirit, unanimously condemned the colonialist policies of Britain, France, and the United States, and unanimously supported Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company. The Chinese people more enthusiastically support the just actions of the Egyptian people in opposing colonialism and resolutely safeguarding sovereignty and independence. The Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries' support for the Egyptian people has further encouraged the Egyptian people's courage and confidence in their struggle.

    Not only that, but many countries invited by Britain, France, and the United States to attend the London conference also do not support the so-called "international control" plan, and especially oppose their policy of military threats. Many countries only agreed to participate after Britain guaranteed that they could disagree with the principles put forward in the joint communiqu√© of the three countries. The Soviet Union and Asian and African countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Iran all support Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, oppose Britain and France's military threats, and advocate peaceful consultations to resolve the issue on the basis of not infringing upon Egypt's sovereignty. Even those countries that were selected by the Western three countries and thought would support them, under the influence of neutralism, are only concerned about guaranteeing the free navigation of the canal, and are unwilling to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the colonial interests of Britain, France, and the United States, offending Egypt. Moreover, for countries like West Germany and Japan among them, the weakening of Britain and France in the Middle East is an opportunity for them to expand their own markets, and there is no need to sacrifice their own interests to help Britain and France. Greece has sharp contradictions with Britain on the Cyprus issue, and in order to obtain Egypt's support in the United Nations on the Cyprus issue, Greece is unwilling to offend Egypt, so it refused to participate in the meeting. Italy and the Netherlands have good trade relations with Egypt; Spain is unwilling to lose its influence in North Africa because of the Suez Canal Company issue; Norway, Denmark, and Sweden only want their shipping in the canal to remain normal as it is now, and are unwilling to stir up trouble. Under these circumstances, Britain and France, which are clamoring for armed intervention, are very isolated.

    Especially after the Indian and Soviet governments successively issued righteous and stern statements resolutely safeguarding Egypt's sovereignty, the future of the London conference is already quite clear. The British bourgeois magazine "The Economist" cannot but admit that "if there is to be a fight, it will only be fought by a very limited number of countries, perhaps only Britain and France. In that case, Britain and France cannot even expect the many countries with which they need to be friendly to remain friendly neutrals."

    Under the pressure of the situation, Britain cannot but leave itself room for retreat, because it is highly questionable whether Britain can afford to sit on the lid of a powder keg forever. Although Eden's broadcast speech on August 8 carried an uncontrollable hatred and attacked Nasser, he also said that Britain was not seeking a military solution, but seeking the broadest international agreement. This, on the one hand, was to shirk Britain's responsibility in case the situation deteriorated, and on the other hand, it also reflected Britain's state of being unable to do what it wanted. At the same time, Britain announced the suspension of sending troops to the Mediterranean to ease world opinion's criticism of Britain.

    Egypt's Conciliatory Attitude and U.S. Strategy

    On August 12, the Egyptian government issued a statement opposing international control of the Suez Canal, refusing to participate in the London conference, and pointing out that the conference has no right to make any decisions. At the same time, Egypt suggested initiating a broad conference with other signatory countries of the 1888 Constantinople Convention in order to review the Constantinople Convention and consider concluding an agreement by all participating countries to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal.

    Egypt's conciliatory attitude is in stark contrast to the arrogance of Britain and France, and opens the door to a peaceful resolution of the issue of free navigation of the Suez Canal. Britain, France, and the United States have been completely bankrupt legally, morally, and politically. It is already very difficult for them to bypass Egypt's proposal and hand over their "international control" plan to the London conference for signing and sealing.

    Under these circumstances, the United States is trying to put itself in a more advantageous position than Britain and France, and to seize the initiative. Although the United States still expressed its support for the "international control" plan, claiming that there were no differences with Britain and France, the U.S. State Department has used the vague term "international means" to replace the "international control" put forward in the joint communiqu√© of the three countries, but the real meaning of so-called international means is still international control. The meeting between the U.S. President and the leaders of the two parties in Congress, which was held after the Egyptian government issued a statement, was originally advertised as authorizing the President to take action against Egypt, but the statement issued after the meeting said that a "peaceful and fair solution" could be reached based on the concept of the 1888 Convention.

    The United States is doing this not because it has any substantial differences with Britain and France, but because it is more cunning than Britain and France. The United States recognizes that Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company will definitely have a huge impact on anti-colonialism. The question is whether this impact will come sooner or later. If Britain and France take the approach of threatening force to directly intervene in Egypt, all Arab countries will immediately rise up to deal with the colonialists. If a more roundabout approach is taken, the colonial countries can buy time to use economic, diplomatic, and even subversive means to achieve what they cannot achieve by threatening force. U.S. Senator Johnson, who participated in the meeting between the U.S. President and the leaders of the two parties in Congress, said that they discussed the impact that Egypt's actions might have on the United States in "less than fifteen minutes, less than fifteen days, or less than fifteen months." This sentence is enough to illustrate what the United States is considering.

    The Future of the London Conference

    On August 16, the Western-proposed London conference will be held without Egypt's participation. It can be predicted that at this meeting and outside the meeting, there will be fierce and acute struggles between colonialism and anti-colonialism, between the imperialist bloc and peaceful and neutral countries, between international justice and power politics, and within the imperialist bloc. The London conference has no right to make any decisions on the Suez Canal issue. It should only be an exploratory conference to pave the way for further consultations with Egypt and other relevant countries in the future. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and other countries that sympathize with Egypt and uphold justice will play an active role and influence at the meeting. On August 15, on the eve of the London conference, our government also issued a statement supporting the Egyptian government's proposal to convene a broad international conference to resolve the dispute, and hoping that Britain and France would adopt a wise attitude conducive to easing international tensions and stop threatening force.

    On the other hand, it must also be estimated that in the face of the possibility that the meeting may not achieve its intended purpose, the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States may become angry, exert great pressure on Egypt and the countries participating in the meeting, and even make unilateral decisions to force implementation. The fact that Britain immediately resumed sending troops to the Mediterranean after the Egyptian government issued a statement full of conciliatory spirit, and that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd threatened to use force as a last resort on the eve of the meeting, shows the existence of this possibility. Therefore, people must still be vigilant and continue to vigorously support the Egyptian people's struggle to force the colonial countries to change their attitudes.
