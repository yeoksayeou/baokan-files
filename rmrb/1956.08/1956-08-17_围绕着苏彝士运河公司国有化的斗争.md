Commentary on Current International Affairs:

    The situation arising from Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a complex and acute struggle. This struggle will have a significant impact on the future development of the international situation.

    On July 26, Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which greatly shocked the Western colonial powers.

    Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is completely reasonable and legal, because the canal is located on Egyptian territory. The Suez Canal Company is a company registered in Egypt and is governed by Egyptian law. Egypt's nationalization of an enterprise on its territory is an act within its sovereignty, and other countries have no right to interfere.

    Since the Suez Canal is an international waterway, the Egyptian government, after announcing the nationalization of the canal company, guaranteed the freedom of navigation and actively took measures to ensure that the Suez Canal could better serve international shipping.

    But the colonial powers were unwilling to let the matter rest. Unable to find a reason to oppose the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, they simply shouted and insisted that Egypt was not capable of managing the canal, that Egypt's guarantee of freedom of navigation was unreliable, and demanded so-called "international control" of the canal, attempting to use this sleight of hand to cancel the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, thereby permanently controlling the canal indefinitely. Britain and France clamored particularly loudly, even mobilizing troops and showing a murderous intent to prepare for armed intervention. The United States, on the one hand, supported Britain and France, and on the other hand, put on a "prudent" face, pretending to hope that the issue would not escalate and could be resolved peacefully.

    British and French Appearances Deceptive

    There is a reason why Britain and France are so furious.

    Britain owns 44% of the shares in the Suez Canal Company. This shareholding not only allowed Britain to control the Suez Canal Company, but also brought it huge annual dividends. Now that control and dividends are lost, it is of course very painful. But more importantly, the Suez Canal is the lifeline of this colonial empire. It is an important transportation route for Britain to extract raw materials and oil from Asia and East Africa and to export manufactured goods to these places. Strategically, the Suez Canal Zone was once a huge British military base controlling the Middle East and Africa. Although Britain was forced to withdraw its troops from here, as long as the Suez Canal Company is in its hands, it can still return at any time if the situation requires. The loss of control over the canal company deepens the crisis of the British Empire.

    What Britain is particularly afraid of is the chain reaction that Egypt's actions may cause in Asia and Africa. Britain spent a great deal of effort to resolve the crisis caused by Iran's nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. If Asian and African countries follow Egypt's example and nationalize the enterprises operated there by British monopoly capital, the future of British colonialism will be unimaginable. The victory of Egypt's anti-colonialist struggle will greatly encourage the courage and confidence of the people of the colonial lands of Asia and Africa to fight for independence, and the colonial system will accelerate its collapse. It is this terrifying scene of the setting sun shining on the British Empire that has led the British ruling group to determine to suppress Egypt in order to save its decline.

    France owns 52% of the shares in the Suez Canal Company, more than Britain's share. But what worries France even more than the interest on the shares is the impact of Egypt's actions on Algeria. France fears that the Algerian people, stirred by an even higher tide of anti-colonialism, will more resolutely deal with the French colonialists.

    However, it is not so easy to suppress the Egyptian people by force. Apart from other factors, Britain and France do not have enough strength now. British troops are busy dealing with the people of Asian and African colonies. In order to suppress the Algerian people, France has exhausted its domestic troops, making it even more difficult than Britain. Therefore, it has to rely on Britain, wanting to use Britain's strength to protect France's interests. And Britain itself must rely on the United States. As a Japanese reporter said, France wants to lean on Britain, and Britain wants to lean on the United States. But the United States has its own plans!

    U.S. Faces Dilemma

    This ally of Britain and France has very complicated feelings about Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company. The United States' diplomatic predicament of being caught in a dilemma and being stretched thin has once again been exposed.

    Like Britain, the United States is very hostile to the Egyptian independence movement, because no matter how many methods they have used, the Egyptian government still adheres to its independent, peaceful, and neutral policy. In particular, Egypt's recognition of China has greatly angered the United States. For colonial countries, an independent Egypt appearing in Africa is a serious threat to colonialism. The influence of Egypt's policy of peace and neutrality has caused great difficulties for the United States' plan to piece together an aggressive bloc in the Middle East.

    Therefore, after failing to win over Egypt, the United States wants to find ways to strike at Egypt. Its refusal to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam is to create difficulties for the Egyptian government, so as to eventually subvert this government that it finds disagreeable. The United States wants to use this method of killing one to warn a hundred to suppress the increasingly high tide of the anti-colonial movement and the trend of peace and neutrality that is sweeping the world.

    Although Britain was the hardest hit by Egypt's actions, this action, following the U.S. and Britain's refusal to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam, was, after all, a loud slap in the face of the United States. Although the United States does not have a large interest in the Suez Canal Company, the United States' oil interests in the Middle East are quite large. The impact of Egypt's actions will similarly damage the United States' colonial interests. At the same time, the United States is not oblivious to the strategic value of the Suez Canal. Therefore, the United States also feels that it is necessary to suppress Egypt.

    But if the United States comes out in the open and supports Britain and France's war actions, it will completely expose the true face of American colonialism in front of the whole world. Moreover, in the year of the U.S. election, bringing the American people to the "brink of war" will completely bankrupt the Republican Party's campaign slogan of "peace and prosperity." But not supporting Britain and France is not an option, because in the end, the United States itself is the number one colonial power, and it must oppose the anti-colonial movement. It is this dilemma that makes the United States dare not openly support Britain and France's military threats and put on some conciliatory gestures, but on the other hand, breathes through the same nostril as Britain and France on fundamental issues.

    In the United States' view, when Britain and France are having bad luck in the Middle East and Africa, it is also the most favorable time for the United States to squeeze out Britain and France's influence. If the United States can support Britain and France's demands on the one hand, and pretend not to be unsympathetic to Egypt and the people of the Middle East on the other, and cope with this crisis, the United States may be able to appear as a friend of the Middle East and African people, replacing the positions of Britain and France, old colonialists, who are increasingly resented by the people of this region.

    Behind-the-Scenes Intrigue at the London Conference

    Therefore, when Britain and France urgently asked the United States to discuss ways to deal with Egypt, the United States only sent Assistant Secretary of State Murphy to London. This made Britain and France very dissatisfied. Britain and France are not unaware of the United States' plans, but in this emergency, they have to "drink poison to quench their thirst." In order to obtain the support of the United States, Britain and France put pressure on the United States. Militarily, Britain and France deliberately made a show of force, and threatened that if the United States did not support them, they would "go it alone." This, on the one hand, was intimidating the Egyptian people, and on the other hand, it was also showing the United States its determination to drag it down. At the same time, Britain and France did not forget to inform the United States of the "great righteousness" of the common interests of the colonial countries, and pointed out that the United States also needed the support of Britain and France on many issues - such as obstructing the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations.

    In order to put pressure on Egypt and force it to make concessions, while at the same time coping with Britain and France and showing the "unity" of the colonial countries, the United States announced the freezing of Egyptian government assets in the United States, sent its Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea to conduct "exercises," and Dulles also rushed to London in person. As a result of the London talks, a joint communiqué was issued, deciding to invite twenty-four selected countries to hold a meeting in London on August 16 to discuss the issue of "international control" of the Suez Canal. The list of invited countries was drawn up in accordance with the principle of ensuring that the three countries could get majority support at the meeting, so as to enable the meeting to complete the task of rubber-stamping the "international control" plan for the three countries.

    The United States fundamentally agrees with this "international control" plan in its heart, but it does not dare to call for it as openly as Britain and France, and is thus caught in a dilemma. Success in this plan would benefit the United States. It can take the opportunity to intervene and gain control over the Suez Canal, which it has long coveted. However, in doing so, the United States must reveal its true colors as a colonialist in front of the entire world, and the impact may also require "international control" of the Panama Canal, which the United States single-handedly controls. Therefore, when Dulles returned to the United States after the joint communiqué was issued, he said that the United States had not assumed any obligation to take any measures in the event that the London conference failed. This sentence was said to the American people, and also to the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people. The United States simultaneously spread the atmosphere of being willing to continue to assist Egypt in building the Aswan Dam, and repeatedly stated that the Sixth Fleet's actions in the Mediterranean were planned long ago. Not only that, but the United States also reversed Britain and France's practice and ordered American merchant ships to pay tolls to the Suez Canal Company under Egyptian management.

    This attitude of the United States greatly disappointed Britain and France, but there was nothing they could do. On the one hand, they continued to make military threats against Egypt in a tense manner, wanting to force Egypt to come to the London conference, and on the other hand, they actively formulated their wishful "international control" plan, preparing to bring it to the London conference for a vote and passage.

    Colonialists Isolated

    But the development of the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to these three colonial countries. Military threats have not intimidated the Egyptian people, but have aroused the indignation of the people of Asia and Africa and all those in the world with a sense of justice. Arab countries resolutely stand on Egypt's side, and even Iraq and Iran in the Baghdad Pact support Egypt's nationalization actions. The Arab people have also countered Britain, France, and the United States' military threats with counter-threats of sabotaging Middle Eastern oil pipelines and confiscating foreign oil fields. Egypt's western neighbor Libya resolutely opposes Britain's increase in troops in Libya, and announced that it will not allow Britain to use Libya as a route to attack Egypt.

    World opinion also severely condemns Britain, France, and the United States' outdated gunboat policy, believing that this is a threat to world peace. In particular, the people of Asian and African countries, under the illumination of the Bandung spirit, unanimously condemned the colonialist policies of Britain, France, and the United States, and unanimously supported Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company. The Chinese people more enthusiastically support the just actions of the Egyptian people in opposing colonialism and resolutely safeguarding sovereignty and independence. The Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries' support for the Egyptian people has further encouraged the Egyptian people's courage and confidence in their struggle.

    Not only that, but many countries invited by Britain, France, and the United States to attend the London conference also do not support the so-called "international control" plan, and especially oppose their policy of military threats. Many countries only agreed to participate after Britain guaranteed that they could disagree with the principles put forward in the joint communiqué of the three countries. The Soviet Union and Asian and African countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Iran all support Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, oppose Britain and France's military threats, and advocate peaceful consultations to resolve the issue on the basis of not infringing upon Egypt's sovereignty. Even those countries that were selected by the Western three countries and thought would support them, under the influence of neutralism, are only concerned about guaranteeing the free navigation of the canal, and are unwilling to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the colonial interests of Britain, France, and the United States, offending Egypt. Moreover, for countries like West Germany and Japan among them, the weakening of Britain and France in the Middle East is an opportunity for them to expand their own markets, and there is no need to sacrifice their own interests to help Britain and France. Greece has sharp contradictions with Britain on the Cyprus issue, and in order to obtain Egypt's support in the United Nations on the Cyprus issue, Greece is unwilling to offend Egypt, so it refused to participate in the meeting. Italy and the Netherlands have good trade relations with Egypt; Spain is unwilling to lose its influence in North Africa because of the Suez Canal Company issue; Norway, Denmark, and Sweden only want their shipping in the canal to remain normal as it is now, and are unwilling to stir up trouble. Under these circumstances, Britain and France, which are clamoring for armed intervention, are very isolated.

    Especially after the Indian and Soviet governments successively issued righteous and stern statements resolutely safeguarding Egypt's sovereignty, the future of the London conference is already quite clear. The British bourgeois magazine "The Economist" cannot but admit that "if there is to be a fight, it will only be fought by a very limited number of countries, perhaps only Britain and France. In that case, Britain and France cannot even expect the many countries with which they need to be friendly to remain friendly neutrals."

    Under the pressure of the situation, Britain cannot but leave itself room for retreat, because it is highly questionable whether Britain can afford to sit on the lid of a powder keg forever. Although Eden's broadcast speech on August 8 carried an uncontrollable hatred and attacked Nasser, he also said that Britain was not seeking a military solution, but seeking the broadest international agreement. This, on the one hand, was to shirk Britain's responsibility in case the situation deteriorated, and on the other hand, it also reflected Britain's state of being unable to do what it wanted. At the same time, Britain announced the suspension of sending troops to the Mediterranean to ease world opinion's criticism of Britain.

    Egypt's Conciliatory Attitude and U.S. Strategy

    On August 12, the Egyptian government issued a statement opposing international control of the Suez Canal, refusing to participate in the London conference, and pointing out that the conference has no right to make any decisions. At the same time, Egypt suggested initiating a broad conference with other signatory countries of the 1888 Constantinople Convention in order to review the Constantinople Convention and consider concluding an agreement by all participating countries to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal.

    Egypt's conciliatory attitude is in stark contrast to the arrogance of Britain and France, and opens the door to a peaceful resolution of the issue of free navigation of the Suez Canal. Britain, France, and the United States have been completely bankrupt legally, morally, and politically. It is already very difficult for them to bypass Egypt's proposal and hand over their "international control" plan to the London conference for signing and sealing.

    Under these circumstances, the United States is trying to put itself in a more advantageous position than Britain and France, and to seize the initiative. Although the United States still expressed its support for the "international control" plan, claiming that there were no differences with Britain and France, the U.S. State Department has used the vague term "international means" to replace the "international control" put forward in the joint communiqué of the three countries, but the real meaning of so-called international means is still international control. The meeting between the U.S. President and the leaders of the two parties in Congress, which was held after the Egyptian government issued a statement, was originally advertised as authorizing the President to take action against Egypt, but the statement issued after the meeting said that a "peaceful and fair solution" could be reached based on the concept of the 1888 Convention.

    The United States is doing this not because it has any substantial differences with Britain and France, but because it is more cunning than Britain and France. The United States recognizes that Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company will definitely have a huge impact on anti-colonialism. The question is whether this impact will come sooner or later. If Britain and France take the approach of threatening force to directly intervene in Egypt, all Arab countries will immediately rise up to deal with the colonialists. If a more roundabout approach is taken, the colonial countries can buy time to use economic, diplomatic, and even subversive means to achieve what they cannot achieve by threatening force. U.S. Senator Johnson, who participated in the meeting between the U.S. President and the leaders of the two parties in Congress, said that they discussed the impact that Egypt's actions might have on the United States in "less than fifteen minutes, less than fifteen days, or less than fifteen months." This sentence is enough to illustrate what the United States is considering.

    The Future of the London Conference

    On August 16, the Western-proposed London conference will be held without Egypt's participation. It can be predicted that at this meeting and outside the meeting, there will be fierce and acute struggles between colonialism and anti-colonialism, between the imperialist bloc and peaceful and neutral countries, between international justice and power politics, and within the imperialist bloc. The London conference has no right to make any decisions on the Suez Canal issue. It should only be an exploratory conference to pave the way for further consultations with Egypt and other relevant countries in the future. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and other countries that sympathize with Egypt and uphold justice will play an active role and influence at the meeting. On August 15, on the eve of the London conference, our government also issued a statement supporting the Egyptian government's proposal to convene a broad international conference to resolve the dispute, and hoping that Britain and France would adopt a wise attitude conducive to easing international tensions and stop threatening force.

    On the other hand, it must also be estimated that in the face of the possibility that the meeting may not achieve its intended purpose, the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States may become angry, exert great pressure on Egypt and the countries participating in the meeting, and even make unilateral decisions to force implementation. The fact that Britain immediately resumed sending troops to the Mediterranean after the Egyptian government issued a statement full of conciliatory spirit, and that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd threatened to use force as a last resort on the eve of the meeting, shows the existence of this possibility. Therefore, people must still be vigilant and continue to vigorously support the Egyptian people's struggle to force the colonial countries to change their attitudes.

### 围绕着苏彝士运河公司国有化的斗争
顾思

    围绕着苏彝士运河公司国有化的斗争
    顾思
    埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后所引起的局势，是一场复杂而尖锐的斗争。这场斗争将对今后国际形势的发展产生重大的影响。
    七月二十六日，埃及宣布把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，使得西方殖民国家大为震惊。
    埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，是完全合理合法的。因为运河是在埃及的领土上。苏彝士运河公司是在埃及注册的一家公司，它受埃及的法律管辖。埃及把在它领土上的企业收归国有，是它主权范围以内的行为，其他国家是无权干涉的。
    由于苏彝士运河是一条国际通航的运河，所以埃及政府在宣布把运河公司国有化以后，保证运河通航自由，并且积极采取措施，使苏彝士运河能够更好地为国际航运服务。
    但是殖民国家不肯就此干休。他们拿不出理由来反对苏彝士运河公司国有化，就只好大叫大嚷，硬说埃及没有能力管理运河，硬说埃及对运河通航自由的保证靠不住，要求对运河实行所谓“国际管制”，想用这个偷天换日的手段来取消苏彝士运河公司的国有化，从而就可以无限期地永久控制运河。英、法两国叫嚣得特别厉害，它们甚至调兵遣将，露出一付杀气腾腾准备武装干涉的凶相。美国一方面支持英法，一方面又摆出“审慎”的面孔，装作希望问题不要闹大、能够和平解决的样子。
    英法外强中干
    英、法两国这样怒气冲天，是有原因的。
    英国在苏彝士运河公司中占有44％的股份。这部分股份不但使英国控制了苏彝士运河公司，而且每年给它带来巨额的红利。现在控制权和红利一旦丧失，当然十分心痛。但是，更重要的是因为苏彝士运河是这个殖民帝国的生命线。它是英国从亚洲和东非搜括原料、石油和向这些地方输出制成品的重要交通线。在战略上来说，苏彝士运河区曾经是英国控制中东和非洲的巨大军事基地。英国虽然被迫从这里撤退了它的军队，但是只要苏彝士运河公司在它手里，一旦情况需要，它仍旧可以随时回来。对运河公司控制权的丧失，加深了大英帝国的危机。
    而使英国特别害怕的，是埃及的行动在亚洲和非洲可能引起的连锁反应。英国花了极大的力气，才解决了伊朗把英伊石油公司收归国有所引起的危机。如果亚非国家都向埃及学习，把英国垄断资本在那里经营的企业收归国有，英国殖民主义者的前途就将不堪设想。而埃及反殖民主义斗争的胜利，将大大鼓舞亚非两洲殖民地人民争取独立的勇气和信心，殖民制度将加速崩溃。正是落日照临在大英帝国头上的这幅可怖的情景，使得英国统治集团决心要镇压埃及，来挽救自己的没落。
    法国在苏彝士运河公司中拥有52％的股票，比英国的份额还要多。而比股票利息更使法国担心的是埃及这个行动对阿尔及利亚的影响。法国害怕阿尔及利亚人民在更加高涨的反殖民主义浪潮的激动之下，将更坚决地同法国殖民者周旋。
    但是，要用武力来镇压埃及人民并不是那么容易的。除去其他因素不说，英国和法国现在都没有足够的力量。英国的军队都在忙着应付亚洲和非洲殖民地人民。法国为了镇压阿尔及利亚人民，国内兵力已经罗掘俱穷，比英国还困难得厉害。因此它只好依靠英国，想借英国的力量来保护法国的利益。而英国自己却又必须依靠美国。正如一位日本记者所说的，法国想靠在英国身上，而英国又想靠在美国身上。可是美国却另有自己的打算！
    美国进退两难
    这位英、法的盟友对于埃及收回苏彝士运河公司这个行动，抱有很复杂的心情。美国外交进退两难、捉襟见肘的窘境，这一次又暴露无遗。
    美国和英国一样，对埃及独立运动是十分仇视的，因为不管它们用了多少办法，埃及政府仍然坚持它的独立的和平中立的政策，特别是埃及承认了中国，使美国大为恼怒。对于殖民国家来说，一个坚持独立的埃及出现在非洲，是对殖民主义的严重威胁。而埃及奉行和平中立政策的影响，使得美国在中东拚凑侵略集团的计划遭到了巨大的困难。
    因此，美国在争取不到埃及以后，就要想办法打击埃及。它拒绝援助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝，就是想给埃及政府制造困难，以便最后颠复这个使它觉得不顺眼的政府。美国想用这个杀一儆百的办法，来镇压日益高涨的反殖民主义运动和在世界范围内风起云涌的和平中立的趋向。
    埃及的行动打击得最厉害的虽然是英国，但是这个行动紧跟在美、英拒绝援助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝以后，毕竟也是打在美国脸上的一记响亮的耳光。美国在苏彝士运河公司中虽然没有很大的利益，但是美国在中东的石油利益是相当巨大的。埃及的行动影响所及，将使美国的殖民利益同样受到损害。同时，美国对于苏彝士运河的战略价值，也并不是不眼红的。因此，美国也觉得镇压一下埃及是有必要的。
    但是美国如果出头露面，支持英法的战争行动，就会在全世界面前彻底暴露美国殖民主义的真面目。而且在美国大选的年头，把美国人民带到“战争边缘”上去，共和党的“和平与繁荣”的竞选口号就要彻底破产。但是不支持英、法又不行，因为到头来美国自己就是头一号殖民国家，它必然要反对反殖民主义运动。正是这种左右为难的处境，使得美国一方面不敢公开支持英法的军事威胁，而摆出某些和解的姿态，但是另一方面在基本问题上却和英法一鼻孔出气。
    在美国看来，英、法在中东和非洲倒霉的时候，也正是美国排挤英、法势力的最有利的时机。如果美国能够一面支持英、法的要求，一面又装出并不是不同情埃及和中东人民的面孔，把这场危机应付过去，美国就有可能在英、法这些老牌殖民主义者越来越遭到这个地区人民敌视的情况下，以中东和非洲人民的朋友的姿态出现，代替英、法的地位。
    伦敦会议幕后的勾心斗角
    因此，当英、法急如星火地要求同美国商量对付埃及的办法的时候，美国只派了助理国务卿墨菲到伦敦去。这使英、法非常不满。英、法对于美国的打算并不是不了解，但是在这紧急关头，也就只好“饮鸩止渴”。为了取得美国的支持，英、法对美国施加了压力。在军事上，英、法故意弄得刀剑铿锵，并且扬言如果美国不支持，它们就要“单独干”。这一方面固然是恫吓埃及人民，另一方面也是向美国表示要把它硬拖下水的决心。同时英、法也没有忘记向美国晓以殖民国家共同利益的“大义”，并且指出美国在许多问题上——例如阻挠恢复中国在联合国的席位问题——也少不了英、法的支持。
    为了对埃及施加压力，迫使它作出让步，同时又应付英、法，表示殖民国家的“团结”，美国宣布冻结埃及政府在美国的财产，把它在地中海的第六舰队开出来举行“演习”，杜勒斯也亲自赶到伦敦。伦敦会谈的结果，发表了联合公报，决定邀请挑选出来的二十四个国家，在八月十六日在伦敦举行会议，讨论苏彝士运河的“国际管制”的问题。这张被邀请国的名单，是按照能够保证三国在会上得到多数支持的原则拟订的，以便使会议完成给三国的“国际管制”计划盖橡皮图章的任务。
    对于这个“国际管制”计划，美国骨子里完全赞成，但又不敢像英法那样露骨地叫，因而也是左右为难。搞成了这个计划，对美国有好处。它可以趁此插手，来得到它垂涎已久的对苏彝士运河的控制权。但是，这样一来，美国就必须在整个世界面前露出殖民主义者的真面目，而且影响所及，也有可能要求对美国一手控制着的巴拿马运河也来个“国际管制”。因此，杜勒斯在联合公报发表以后，回到美国的时候，就说美国对于伦敦会议万一失败以后采取什么措施，并没有承担任何义务。这句话是说给美国人民听的，也是说给埃及和中东人民听的。美国同时散布愿意继续援助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的空气，并且一再声明第六舰队在地中海的行动是早就计划了的。不但如此，美国还一反英、法的做法，命令美国商船向埃及管理下的苏彝士运河公司交纳通行税。
    美国这种态度使英、法非常失望，但是又无可奈何。它们一方面继续剑拔弩张地对埃及进行武力威胁，想把埃及逼到伦敦会议上来，一方面积极拟订它们那个一相情愿的“国际管制”的计划，准备拿到伦敦会议上来表决通过。
    殖民主义者孤立了
    但是，情势的发展对于这三个殖民国家越来越不利了。武力威胁并没有吓倒埃及人民，反而激起了亚非人民和全世界稍有正义感的人的忿慨。阿拉伯国家坚决地站在埃及这一边，甚至巴格达条约集团中的伊拉克和伊朗，也支持埃及的国有化行动。阿拉伯人民并且以破坏中东的油管、没收外国油田的反威胁，来对付英、法、美的武力威胁。埃及的西邻利比亚坚决反对英国增加在利比亚的兵力，并且宣布不许英国假道利比亚进攻埃及。
    世界舆论也严厉谴责英、法、美的过了时的炮舰政策，认为这是对世界和平的威胁。特别是亚洲和非洲各国人民，在万隆精神照耀之下，众口一词地谴责英、法、美的殖民主义政策，一致支持埃及收回苏彝士运河公司。中国人民更热烈地支持埃及人民的反对殖民主义、坚决维护主权和独立的正义行动。中国人民和亚非各国人民对埃及人民的支持，更加鼓舞了埃及人民的斗争勇气和信心。
    不但这样，被英、法、美邀请来开伦敦会议的许多国家，也不支持所谓“国际管制”的计划，特别反对它们的武力威胁政策。许多国家都是在英国保证它们可以不同意三国联合公报中提出的原则以后才答应参加的。苏联以及亚非国家像印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、锡兰、伊朗等国，都支持埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，反对英、法的武力威胁，主张在不侵犯埃及主权的基础上和平协商解决问题。就是西方三国挑选出来认为会支持它们的那些国家，在中立主义的影响下，它们所关心的只是保证运河自由通航的问题，不愿意替英、法、美三国的殖民利益去火中取栗，得罪埃及。而且对于其中像西德和日本这样的国家来说，英、法在中东的削弱，正是它扩张自己市场的机会，更没有为了帮助英、法去断送自己利益的必要。希腊同英国在塞浦路斯问题上有尖锐的矛盾，而且为了取得埃及在联合国中对塞浦路斯问题的支持，希腊不愿冒犯埃及，所以拒绝参加会议。意大利、荷兰同埃及有良好的贸易关系；西班牙不愿因为苏彝士运河公司问题而丧失自己在北非的影响；挪威、丹麦、瑞典只要自己在运河的航运像现在这样始终保持正常，不愿意去惹是生非。在这种情况下，叫嚣武力干涉的英、法就十分孤立了。
    特别在印度和苏联政府先后发表了义正词严、坚决维护埃及主权的声明以后，伦敦会议的前途如何，已经相当明显。英国资产阶级的杂志“经济学家”也不能不承认，“要打的话也只会是十分有限的一些国家来打，或许只有英国和法国。在那种情况下，英法甚至不能指望它们需要与之友好的许多国家保持友爱的中立。”
    在形势的逼迫下面，英国不能不给自己留下作退一步打算的余地，因为英国是否经得起永远坐在火药筒的盖子上是大成问题的。艾登八月八日的广播演说虽然带着不可遏制的憎恨大肆攻击纳赛尔，可是同时又说英国并不谋求武力解决，而是谋求最广泛的国际协议。这一方面固然是为了在万一局势恶化时可以推卸英国的责任，另一方面也确实反映了英国力不从心的窘态。同时，英国宣布停止向地中海派遣部队，以缓和世界舆论对英国的责难。
    埃及的和解态度和美国的策略
    八月十二日，埃及政府发表声明，反对国际管制苏彝士运河，拒绝参加伦敦会议，并且指出会议无权作出任何决定。同时埃及建议同1888年君士坦丁堡公约其他签字国发起一个广泛性的会议，以便审查君士坦丁堡公约，并考虑由所有与会国家缔结一个协定来重新肯定和保证苏彝士运河航行自由。
    埃及这种和解态度同英法的专横，恰巧成了一个鲜明的对照，并且给和平解决苏彝士运河的自由通航问题打开了大门。英、法、美在法理上、道义上、政治上已经彻底破产。它们要想撇开埃及的建议，把自己的“国际管制”计划交给伦敦会议去签字画押，已经是十分困难的事情了。
    在这种情况下，美国就竭力使自己处于比英、法有利的地位，争取主动。美国虽然还表示支持“国际管制”的计划，声称同英、法没有分歧，但是美国务院已经用“国际手段”这种含糊的说法来代替三国联合公报中所提出的“国际管制”，其实所谓国际手段的真实含义仍然是国际管制。在埃及政府发表声明以后举行的美国总统同国会两党领袖的会议，本来是被宣传成要授权总统对埃及采取行动的，但是会议以后发表的声明却说，可以根据1888年公约的概念“来达成和平而公平的解决办法”。
    美国这样做，并不表明美国同英、法有什么实质上的不同，而只是因为它比英、法更狡猾一些。美国认识到，埃及收回苏彝士运河公司肯定将对反殖民主义产生巨大的影响。问题是使这影响来得快一些还是慢一些。如果采取英、法的用武力威胁来对埃及直接进行干涉的办法，所有阿拉伯国家都将立即起来对付殖民主义者。如果采取比较迂回的手段，殖民国家就可以赢得喘息的时间，以便用经济的、外交的以至颠复活动的手段，来达到它们用武力威胁不能达到的目的。参加美国总统和国会两党领袖会议的美国参议员约翰逊说，他们讨论了埃及的行动在“十五分钟以内、十五天以内或者十五个月以内”可能对美国发生的影响。这句话很足以说明美国的考虑何在。
    伦敦会议前途如何
    八月十六日，西方建议的伦敦会议将在没有埃及参加之下举行。可以预料，在这个会议上和会议以外，殖民主义与反殖民主义之间，帝国主义集团与和平中立国家之间，国际正义与强权政治之间，以及帝国主义集团内部，都将有激烈的尖锐的斗争。伦敦会议无权对苏彝士运河问题作出任何决定。它只应成为一个探讨性的会议，以便为将来同埃及以及其他有关国家作进一步的协商开辟途径。苏联、印度、印度尼西亚等同情埃及、主持正义的国家，在会议上将会起积极的作用和影响。我国政府也在八月十五日伦敦会议前夕发表声明，支持埃及政府提出的召开广泛性国际会议来解决争端的建议，并且希望英、法采取有利于和缓国际紧张局势的明智态度，停止武力威胁。
    另一方面，也必须估计到，在面临会议可能达不到预定目的的情况下，英、法、美三国有可能老羞成怒，对埃及以及参加会议的国家施加强大的压力，甚至作出片面的决定来强迫施行。英国在埃及政府发表充满和解精神的声明以后立即恢复向地中海派遣部队，以及英国外交大臣劳埃德在会议前夕扬言要以武力作最后手段，就说明了这种可能性的存在，因此人们仍然必须保持警惕，并且继续有力地声援埃及人民的斗争，来迫使殖民国家改变它们的态度。
