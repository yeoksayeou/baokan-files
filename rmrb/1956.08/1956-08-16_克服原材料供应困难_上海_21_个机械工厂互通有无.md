Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 14th. Twenty-one factories in Shanghai under the First Ministry of Machine Building have mutually adjusted 578 tons of raw materials in the past three months. The raw material supply departments of these factories hold regular meetings to share information and help overcome difficulties in material supply.

When the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory was manufacturing forging hammers in July, it urgently needed a batch of steel. After contacting the China Shipbuilding Factory, it obtained two tons of leftover steel plate, ensuring the production of the forging hammers. Recently, the China Shipbuilding Factory did not have enough pig iron, and it also obtained four tons from the Mining Machinery Factory. When the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory was manufacturing a batch of cylindrical grinders in July, the alloy steel for the main shaft was insufficient, so it found one ton of temporarily unused alloy steel at the Shanghai Tool Factory. In June and July, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory supported eight factories, including the Tool Factory, Steam Turbine Factory, and Motor Factory, with raw materials worth more than 30,000 yuan. At the same time, its own factory also received much help from these eight brother factories.

Now, there is more and more mutual exchange between factories. The Shanghai Supply Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building recently convened a meeting of supply section chiefs from factories in the East China region to further deploy this work, which is deeply welcomed by the factories.

    克服原材料供应困难
    上海21个机械工厂互通有无
    新华社上海14日电　第一机械工业部在上海的二十一个工厂，在最近三个月里，互相调剂了五百七十八吨原材料。这些工厂的原材料供应部门定期召开互通有无的会议，克服了不少材料供应上的困难。
    上海矿山机器厂七月份制造锻钎机的时候，急需一批钢材。这个工厂和中华造船厂联系后，调到了两吨钢板边角余料，保证了锻钎机的生产。最近中华造船厂需用的生铁不够，也在矿山机器厂调到了四吨。上海机床厂七月份在制造一批外圆磨床的时候，主轴的合金钢不够了，就在上海工具厂找到了一吨暂时不用的合金钢。上海机床厂在六、七两月曾经以价值三万多元的原材料支援了工具厂、汽轮机厂、电机厂等八个工厂，同时自己工厂也得到了这八个兄弟厂的许多帮助。
    现在各厂之间互通有无的往来愈来愈多了。第一机械工业部在上海的供应办事处最近召集华东地区所属工厂供应科长开会，进一步布置了这项深受各厂欢迎的工作。
