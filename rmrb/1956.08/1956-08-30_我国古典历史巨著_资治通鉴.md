    Our Country's Classical Historical Masterpiece – "Zizhi Tongjian"
    Wang Chongwu
    "Zizhi Tongjian," after being punctuated and reorganized, has recently been published by "Gu籍出版社" [Classical Books Publishing House]. It is our country's famous classical chronicle. The author, Sima Guang, referred to abundant historical materials and spent nineteen years writing a political history that uses years as the warp and events as the weft, comprehensively covering important historical events from the Warring States period to the Five Dynasties (403 BC – 959 AD), spanning over 1300 years.

    This book has been highly praised by historical scholars since the Song Dynasty, so many people imitated it and wrote chronicles in the same style, such as Li Tao's "Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian" of the Song Dynasty, Xue Yingqi's "Song Yuan Tongjian" of the Ming Dynasty, Bi Yuan's "Xu Zizhi Tongjian" of the Qing Dynasty, Xia Xie's "Ming Tongjian," and Xu Zi's "Xiaotian Jinian," etc. These books are generally considered good books among chronicles, and they were all written under the influence of "Tongjian."

      Chronicles have a long history in our country, and the book "Zuo Zhuan" greatly improved upon previous writing methods. However, this genre also has its limitations. In order to focus the reader's attention, the chronicle style cannot be too verbose, which means that many historical facts cannot be included, and sometimes even important historical facts must be deleted. Therefore, Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty wrote "Records of the Grand Historian," creating the biographical format. Except for the "Annals" section, which still used the old chronicle style, other historical facts related to people, systems, economy, and other aspects were categorized into biographies, treatises, and tables, thus breaking the old format and making the content much richer than before. Later generations followed the example of "Records of the Grand Historian" in compiling history, becoming the so-called orthodox history style. But the orthodox history style also has its shortcomings. First, classifying and summarizing the entire history into various aspects makes it difficult to concentrate when reading and to see the overall picture of historical development. Second, the content is too broad and the volume is too large, which is very inconvenient for the average reader. Therefore, even after the orthodox history style became popular, the chronicle style was still very much needed. For example, during the Three Kingdoms period, Xun Yue abridged Ban Gu's "Book of Han," which had more than 800,000 words in the orthodox history style, into a chronicle called "Han Ji" with more than 83,000 words. This book was not well written, but it was still popular with the general reader. Since then, authors of all dynasties have tried to write chronicles. But generally speaking, the quality was not high, which relegated this genre to a secondary position; it could not compare with the orthodox history style, and its popularity in society was relatively narrow.

    Since "Zuo Zhuan," there were more than 1000 years from the Warring States period to Sima Guang's time. To record the history of this period, from "Records of the Grand Historian" to "History of the Five Dynasties," there were more than 1500 volumes of orthodox history in the biographical and treatise format. Such voluminous books, as Sima Guang said, even historians may not be able to read in detail, let alone the average candidates busy with exams. This shows that a concise chronicle history was still urgently needed. The compilation of "Zizhi Tongjian" was to meet this need. It started from the Warring States period, precisely to follow "Zuo Zhuan." In Sima Guang's view, the chronicles since Xun Yue's "Han Ji" were of low quality, so "Tongjian" had to start from the Warring States period. This was Sima Guang's confidence. At the same time, Sima Guang did achieve this. We can see that he has pushed the advantages of this genre to a glorious peak on the basis of the "Zuo Zhuan" chronicle style.

    Sima Guang had a unique love for history since he was a child. He read widely and paid attention to the institutions and anecdotes of past dynasties. To meet the need, he had long wanted to compile a chronicle called "Tong Zhi." In 1066, he wrote the Zhou and Qin sections, a total of eight volumes, and presented them to Emperor Yingzong of the Song Dynasty. In that year, Emperor Yingzong ordered the compilation of the deeds of emperors and ministers of past dynasties, using "Tong Zhi" as the basis for "continued additions" and compilation. The following year, it was renamed "Zizhi Tongjian." Emperor Yingzong also wrote a preface to show encouragement. Therefore, the first eight volumes of "Tongjian," that is, the Zhou and Qin sections, were basically completed before Sima Guang was ordered to compile the book in 1066.

    The compilation of "Zizhi Tongjian" was divided into two periods: The first was from 1066 to 1070, when Sima Guang was a Hanlin academician in Kaifeng, the capital of the Song Dynasty. In these five years, he completed the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, a total of seventy-eight volumes. The second was from 1071 to 1084, when Sima Guang compiled in Luoyang. In these fourteen years, he held redundant and leisurely official positions, which gave him more time to complete the history of the Jin to Later Zhou dynasties, a total of two hundred and sixteen volumes. He submitted each dynasty to the emperor of the Song Dynasty after he finished compiling it. Due to changes in official positions, the official titles on the front of each volume are often different, from which we can see the time of writing of each volume. Sima Guang was forty-eight years old when he was ordered to compile the book, and he was already sixty-six years old when the whole book was finalized. He died two years later. In his later years, he devoted all his energy to writing "Tongjian." He said in the table presenting "Tongjian": "Now my bones are thin and emaciated, my eyesight is blurred and near-sighted, I have few teeth left, and my spirit is declining... My energy is exhausted in this book."

    Sima Guang had three capable assistants when writing this famous history book. One was Liu Shu, Sima Guang said that he "was good at memorization, read everything outside of biographies, including village records, private notes, and miscellaneous sayings." "For thousands of years, he had a firm grasp of both major and minor events, all of which were based on evidence and could be verified." Liu Shu made great contributions to the overall planning and management of the whole book. Sima Guang once said: "Guang's acquisition of Daoyuan (Shu) is like a blind teacher getting a physiognomist." Liu Shu was most familiar with the history of the Three Kingdoms to the Sui Dynasty and the Five Dynasties. This section of history in "Tongjian," a total of one hundred and forty-five volumes, accounting for nearly one-half of the entire book, the majority of the first drafts were written with the help of Liu Shu.

    The second was Fan Zuyu. He followed Sima Guang in Luoyang to compile books for more than ten years, and most of the first drafts of the Tang to Five Dynasties sections (eighty-one volumes) were compiled by Fan Zuyu. (The first draft of the Five Dynasties section was originally compiled by Liu Shu, but he died before finishing it, and it was later completed by Fan Zuyu.) He separately engraved the drafts of the Tang Dynasty section that he had organized as "Tang Jian" in twelve volumes, with three hundred and six "Discussions" attached, many of which differed from "Tongjian." By comparing the two, we can see where Sima Guang's cuts and choices were made.

    The third was Liu Ban. Liu Ban was responsible for the work of sorting and arranging the sixty volumes of the "Han Ji" section of "Tongjian."

    The compilation method of this book can be roughly divided into three processes. First, the details of the historical facts were extracted from various books in chronological order, called "Congmu" (roughly the same as the card materials copied by modern people). Second, the "Congmu" were selected and connected to form a "Changbian" (long draft). Third, the "Changbian" was revised, compared, simplified, and deleted to become the final draft. The first two steps were mostly done by Liu Shu, Liu Ban, Fan Zuyu, etc., while copying and transcription were done by scribes. The last step was written by Sima Guang himself. Based on his extensive reading, he worked to simplify and condense. Sima Guang said that when he was compiling books in Luoyang, it took him three days to complete the deletion and modification of one volume of "Changbian." He deleted a lot of text, for example, the "Changbian" of Tang Ji had six or seven hundred volumes, which were reduced to eighty-one volumes after deletion. In addition, the time spent on the textual research during the revision must not have been short. It can be seen that the third step was the most laborious.

    "Tongjian" has the following characteristics:

    First, Sima Guang and others referred to many books and mastered a large amount of material before compiling, so the content of this book is not empty or lacking, and the general records are accurate and credible. According to Song Dynasty records, someone in Luoyang had seen the drafts of "Tongjian," and the number was so large that they filled two rooms. It is also said that "Tongjian," in addition to excerpting the orthodox history, adopted as many as two hundred and twenty-two kinds of miscellaneous histories; in order to verify the differences between the truth and falsehood, one event often adopted three or four kinds of books. Therefore, he sighed: "Without a thorough understanding of the orthodox history, it is not easy to judge the achievements of Tongjian!"

    Sima Guang wrote the basis for his cuts and choices when writing the book into "Tongjian Kao Yi" in thirty volumes (originally a separate publication, the Yuan Dynasty edition with Hu's commentary was scattered under the main text), from which we can see that he used Book A to correct the errors of Book B, and used the Annals to correct the errors of the Treatises, citing as many as three hundred and five kinds of books (including the orthodox history). He was not bound by the traditional historical perspective, and the materials he cited were not necessarily compromised by the orthodox history. For example, "Tongjian" used "Records of the Grand Historian" and "Book of Han" more in the Western Han Dynasty, and used "Book of Later Han" in the Eastern Han Dynasty in about seventy or eighty percent of the places, but used the orthodox history in Wei, Jin to Sui in only sixty or seventy percent of the places, and in Tang Dynasty in less than fifty percent of the places. Ouyang Xiu's "New Book of Tang" and "New History of the Five Dynasties" were only intended to write articles and play with the style, and "Tongjian" used them even less. Sima Guang only sought truth and facts, and widely selected materials from miscellaneous histories and even novels, which was very commendable at the time. In the table presenting Tongjian, he described the process of compiling the book: "Studying hard, exhausting all my thoughts, not enough time in the day, continuing with the night, reading through old histories, collecting from novels, the bamboo slips filled up like a sea of smoke, excavating the hidden, calculating every detail."

    Second, many of the historical materials used in "Tongjian" are from lost books, so "Tongjian" is not only an old-fashioned chronicle history book, but also a collection of lost historical materials. "Chongwen Zongmu" contains more than 30,000 volumes of books, which is a catalog of the official collection of books before Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty. When Sima Guang and others compiled "Tongjian," the official allowed them to refer to these books as much as possible, especially the history books among them, which they must have read carefully. But many books have now been lost. In 1071, Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty gave Sima Guang more than 2,000 volumes of books from his Yingdi collection, plus Sima Guang's own collection, which should have been a large number, and these books must have been lost as well, just like the books listed in "Chongwen Zongmu." But some of the essence of the books, thanks to Sima Guang's quotation, are fortunately preserved in "Tongjian." For example, Sun Sheng's "Wei Shi Chunqiu," Pei Ziye's "Song Lue," and Xiao Shao's "Taiqing Ji" are quite important for the study of the history of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. "Tongjian" not only adopted their historical facts, but also recorded their conclusions, preserving many records of each book. Liu Fang's "Tang Li" was a better book among the Tang Dynasty chronicles, but this book was incomplete in the Southern Song Dynasty, and later it was lost, but "Tongjian" "picked up almost all the events of the whole book," so this book, although lost, is still not lost. "Tongjian" selected the most books on the events of the Tang and Five Dynasties, including genealogies, family biographies, records, novels, etc., in addition to historical biographies and literary collections, and most of these books have also been lost.

    Third, although "Tongjian" is a history compiled during the feudal period, it is different from other histories. It does not record ghost stories, astronomical phenomena (astronomical phenomena are briefly recorded in the "Tongjian Catalogue" he wrote), it does not record "strange festivals" for gaining fame, nor does it record literature and writers that are irrelevant to politics. Therefore, "Tongjian" is only a plain and relatively credible political history, which also includes some important social, economic, and upper-class cultural historical materials. Sima Guang said that he "only took the historical facts that are related to the rise and fall of the country and related to the welfare of the people" to compile "Tongjian." Therefore, it is not difficult to see that he tried to write in broad strokes, not fussing over trivial matters, so most of what he recorded are important historical facts, and even after thousands of years, it is still valuable for reference today.

    It should also be pointed out that Sima Guang and Wang Anshi had different views on the "reform" issue. "Zizhi Tongjian" was originally written for lectures to the emperor, and the book often "borrowed other people's wine cups to dispel his own grievances," and in many places revealed Sima Guang's attacks and retaliations against the opposing party. For example, in Volume 1, after "Three Families Divide Jin," "Chen Guang said": "Virtue wins talent is called a gentleman, talent wins virtue is called a villain"; it also said: "Since ancient times, there have been many rebellious ministers of the country and prodigal sons of the family who have more talent than virtue, which leads to overthrow," which is clearly aimed at the New Party headed by Wang Anshi. (See "Sima Guang's Anthology," "Talent and Virtue Theory") Volume 51, under "Fan Ying's Affair," it is recorded: "Hiding is not what a gentleman wants, people do not know themselves and the Tao cannot be practiced, and when evil people coexist, harm will befall them, so hide deeply to avoid it," which seems to be written for his political frustration and retirement to write books. In Volume 3, under the sections on Su Qin and Zhang Yi, Yang Xiong's "Fa Yan" is quoted to attack the study of diplomacy during the Warring States period, and according to Bi Yuan's "Xu Tongjian," Sima Guang told Emperor Shenzong about this matter: "The art of diplomacy is not beneficial to governance, and the reason why I preserve its events in the book is to show that the customs at that time were specialized in debate, and the ruler of the country listened to it, which is what is called using a clever tongue to restore the country." This is clearly also aimed at the reformers. He attacked the new laws, saying that these were only the views of Wang Anshi, Han Jiang, Lü Huiqing, and others; Wang Anshi's eloquent speech and good at debate can make right wrong, which can destroy the country!

    It can be seen that "Tongjian" is not only an important reference book for learning ancient history, but also because Sima Guang permeated his own political views into the book, reflecting the increasingly acute contradictions of the ruling class in the Song Dynasty, which is of great help for understanding the political struggles at that time.

    The "Zizhi Tongjian" reprinted by Gu籍出版社 [Classical Books Publishing House] this time is based on the Yuan Dynasty edition with Hu's commentary, which was re-engraved by Hu Kejia of the Qing Dynasty, and has been punctuated and reorganized. In addition to punctuation and paragraphing, some annotations and other processing have been added to make it easier for readers to learn and refer to.

    我国古典历史巨著—“资治通鉴”
    王崇武
    “资治通鉴”经过标点整理以后，最近由“古籍出版社”出版了。它是我国著名的古典编年史。作者司马光参考了丰富的史料，花了十九年的时间才把从战国到五代（公元前403——公元959）一千三百余年的重要史实，综写成以年为经、以事为纬的政治史。
    这部书自宋朝以来便为历史学者所推崇，因此有很多人摹仿它，写成同样体裁的编年史，如宋李焘的“续资治通鉴长编”、明薛应旗的“宋元通鉴”、清毕沅的“续资治通鉴”、夏燮的“明通鉴”、徐鼒的“小腆纪年”等。这些书在编年史中，一般都称为好书，全是在“通鉴”的影响之下编写的。
      编年史在我国有着悠久的历史渊源，“左传”一书在继承以往写作方法上，更大有提高。可是这种体裁也有它的很大的局限性。为了使读者的注意力集中，编年体不能过于枝蔓，这就使得有很多史实容纳不了，有时即使是重要的史实也必须删掉。因此，汉司马迁作“史记”，创纪传书表体。除本纪一项仍沿用旧日的编年体而外，另把其他有关人物、制度、经济等项其他方面的史实，分别归类到传、书、表里去，这样就打破了旧规格，内容方面比以前充实多了。此后各代修史都效法“史记”，成为所谓正史体。但正史体也有它的缺点。第一，把整个历史分类归纳到各方面，阅读起来不集中，不易看出历史发展的全貌。第二，内容包罗太广，分量过重，对于一般读者很不方便。所以正史体通行以后，编年体仍是十分需要的。如三国时荀悦把班固八十余万字的正史体“汉书”，缩编为八万三千多字的编年史“汉纪”，这部书编得并不好，但仍受一般读者的欢迎。此后历代作者都曾试作过编年史。但一般说来，质量不高，从而把这种体裁降到次要的地位；它远不能和正史体相比，在社会上的流行面是较为狭小的。
    “左传”以后，从战国到司马光生时，共有一千多年。记载这段时间的历史，从“史记”到“五代史”，有一千五百多卷的纪传志表体的正史。这样卷帙浩繁的书籍，正像司马光所说，就是专门研究历史的人也未必都能细读，何况是一般忙于应考的举子。这说明简明编年体历史还是迫切需要的。“资治通鉴”的编纂就是适应这种要求。它起自战国，正是为了上接“左传”。在司马光看来，自荀悦“汉纪”以来的编年史是水平不高的，因此，“通鉴”就有必要自战国写起，这是司马光的自负之处。同时，司马光确已做到了这一点。我们可以看出，他在“左传”编年体的基础上已把这种体裁的优点推到光辉的顶峰。
    司马光从幼年时起就对历史有着独特的爱好。他博览群书，留心历代的典章掌故。为了适应需要，他早就想编写一部名叫“通志”的编年史。并于1066年写成周秦部分，共八卷，进呈给宋英宗。这年英宗诏令编集历代君臣事迹，命以通志为底本，“续加”修纂。次年改名为“资治通鉴”。英宗并亲为作序，以示鼓励。所以“通鉴”的前八卷，即周秦部分，基本上是1066年司马光奉诏纂书之前作成的。
    “资治通鉴”的编纂共分两个时期：一是1066至1070年司马光在宋朝的首都开封做翰林学士时编纂的。这五年中，编完了周、秦、汉、魏四朝，共七十八卷。二是1071年至1084年司马光在洛阳编纂的。这十四年中，他做的都是冗闲散官，时间较多，编完了晋至后周十二朝的历史，共二百一十六卷。他每编完一代，便上缴给宋朝的皇帝。由于官职的变迁，所以每卷前面署名上的官衔常常不一样，从这里可以看出各卷的写作时代。司马光奉诏修书时，年四十八岁，全书定稿时，已经六十六岁了，此后又过了两年的光景才死去。他在晚年是以全副精神致力于“通鉴”写作的。他在进“通鉴”表上说：“今骸骨癯瘁，目视昏近，齿牙无几，神识衰耗……臣之精力，尽于此书。”
    司马光在编写这部著名历史书时有三位得力的助手。一是刘恕，司马光说他“为人强记，纪传之外，闾里所录，私记杂说，无所不览”。“上下数千载间，细大之事如指掌，皆有稽据可考验”。对于全书的擘划经营，刘恕的贡献很大。司马光曾说：“光之得道原（恕），如瞽师之得相者。”刘恕对三国至隋以及五代的历史最熟悉，“通鉴”这一段的历史共一百四十五卷，占全书的二分之一弱，大部分的初稿是由刘恕帮助写成的。
    其次是范祖禹。他跟随司马光在洛阳修书十几年，唐迄五代部分的初稿（八十一卷）大半是范祖禹编写。（五代部分初稿，原为刘恕编，但编写未完便死去，后归范祖禹完成。）他把自己整理的唐代部分稿子，单刻为“唐鉴”十二卷，并附“论”三百零六篇，其中有很多主张和“通鉴”不同。两相对照，可以看出司马光的剪裁去取之处。
    再次是刘攽。“通鉴”汉纪部分六十卷，排比整理的工作多出自刘攽之手。
    这部书的编纂方法大约可分为三个过程。一、先把史实的原委始末从各书摘录下来，按照年月日的次序排列好，叫作“丛目”（略同近人所抄的卡片材料）。二、将“丛目”加以选择去取，相互粘连起来，成为“长编”。三、把“长编”加以考订比对，精简删削，成为定稿。前两步骤大半为刘恕、刘攽、范祖禹等人所作，而抄录誊写则出自书手。后一步骤，则为司马光自己下笔。他在博览的基础上，作删繁就简的工作。司马光在洛阳修书时，自称一卷长编的删改，要用三天的时间才能完成。他删去的文字非常多，例如唐纪长编有六、七百卷，删削后，成为八十一卷。再加上删改时所作的考证工夫，所花的时间一定也不少。可见第三步工作是最费力气的。
    “通鉴”这部书有以下几个特点：
    第一，司马光等人参考了很多书籍，掌握了大量材料，才进行编纂，因此这部书的内容不空洞、不贫乏，一般的记载都确凿可信。据宋朝人记载，有人曾在洛阳见过“通鉴”的草稿，数量之多竟堆满了两间屋子。又说，“通鉴”除摘录正史以外，采用杂史，多至二百二十二种；为了考辨异同真伪，一件事往往采用三、四种书。因此叹道：“不观正史精熟，未易决通鉴之功绩也！”
    司马光把他写书时剪裁去取的根据写成通鉴考异三十卷（原为单刊本、元刊胡注本散入于正文之下），从这里可以看出他用甲书纠正乙书的遗误，用本纪校正志传的讹舛，所引书籍多至三百零五种（连正史在内）。他不为传统的历史眼光所拘泥，援引的材料不一定都折衷于正史。如“通鉴”西汉阶段采用“史记”、“汉书”的地方固然比较多，东汉采用“后汉书”处也有十分之七八，但魏、晋至隋采用正史的地方不过十分之六七，唐代采用正史之处则不到十分之五。欧阳修作“新唐书”、“新五代史”，只是刻意写文章，玩笔调，“通鉴”采用的地方尤其少。司马光唯务求真求是，把杂史甚至小说的材料都广加甄采，这在当时说来，是很值得称赞的。他在进通鉴表自述编书的经过时说：“研精极虑，穷竭所有，日力不足，继之以夜，遍阅旧史，旁采小说，简牍盈积，浩如烟海，抉擿幽隐，校计毫厘。”
    第二，“通鉴”采用的史料，有很多书籍是失传的，所以“通鉴”不仅是旧式的编年历史书，而且也是已佚史料的汇集书。“崇文总目”共载书籍三万多卷，是宋神宗以前的官家藏书目录。司马光等纂修“通鉴”时，官家允许他们尽量参考这些书，特别是其中的史部书籍，他们必定细读过。但有很多书现在已经失传。在1071年，宋神宗又曾把他的颍邸藏书两千多卷赐给司马光，再加上司马光自己的藏书，应该是一个很大的数目，这些书必定和“崇文总目”所列的书籍一样，也有很多失传的。但书中的若干精华，由于司马光的引用，幸而还保存在“通鉴”里。举例说，孙盛“魏氏春秋”、裴子野“宋略”、萧韶“太清纪”等书对于研究魏晋南北朝的历史是相当重要的，“通鉴”既采其史实，又录其论断，保存了各书的很多记载。柳芳“唐历”是唐代编年史中较好的书，但此书在南宋时便已残缺，后来就失传了，可是“通鉴”“掇取全书事几尽”，所以此书虽佚犹不佚。“通鉴”于唐五代事，甄采书籍最多，除史传文集而外，有谱牒、家传、实录、小说等，这些书也大半失传。
    第三，“通鉴”虽然是封建时编纂的历史，但它和其他历史不同，不载鬼怪之说，不记天文星象（天文星象简记于所作“通鉴目录”中），不录沽名钓誉的“奇节”，也不载与政治无关的文艺和文人。所以“通鉴”全书只是一部平实的、比较可信的政治史，其中也包括一些重要的社会经济和上层文化的史料。司马光说他“专取关国家盛衰，系生民休戚”的史实来编写“通鉴”。因此不难看出，他企图在大处着笔，不斤斤计较于细枝末节的琐事，因此所记大半为重要史实，时隔千年，今日阅读起来，还是有参考的价值。
    还得指出，司马光与王安石在“变法”问题上有着不同的主张。“资治通鉴”原为向皇帝进讲而作，书中往往“借他人的酒杯，消自己的块磊”，很多地方露出司马光对敌党的攻击和报复。如卷一“三家分晋”后“臣光曰”下说：“德胜才谓之君子，才胜德谓之小人”；又说：“自古昔以来，国之乱臣，家之败子，才有余而德不足，以至于颠复者多矣”，这分明是针对以王安石为首的新党而发的。（参看“司马光文集”“才德论”）卷五十一，于“樊英事”下记：“隐非君子之所欲也，人莫己知而道不得行，群邪共处而害将及身，故深藏以避之”，这好像是为自己在政治上失意、隐退著书而写。卷三，苏秦、张仪条下，引杨雄“法言”，对战国时的纵横之学大加攻击，据毕沅“续通鉴”记司马光为宋神宗进讲此事说：“纵横之术，无益于治，臣所以存其事于书者，欲见当时风俗专以辩说相高，人君悉国而听之，此所谓利口复邦者也。”这分明也是对变法诸人而发的。他攻击新法，说这些只是王安石、韩绛、吕惠卿等几个人的主张；王安石巧言善辩，以是为非，可以亡人之国！
    由此可见，“通鉴”不仅是学习古代历史的重要参考书，而且因为司马光把他自己的政治主张渗透在书里，从这部书里反映出宋代统治阶级日益尖锐的矛盾，这对于了解当时的政治斗争情况也有很大的帮助。
    古籍出版社这次重印的“资治通鉴”，是根据清胡克家翻刻的元刊胡注本加以标点整理的。除标点分段以外还增加了一些校注和其他加工，更便于读者学习和参考。
