    Under the Daba Mountains
    —From Baoji to Chengdu VI
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
    Ancient Plank Roads
    On the road south to Chengdu, we sometimes traveled by train and sometimes by car, passing through the ancient plank roads under the Qinling and Daba Mountains.
    From Shuangshipu in Feng County, along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, we crossed Jiuzunliang and Ziguanling to the south, passing through Miaotaizi and Liuba, until we reached Baocheng. The car journey was always through deep mountains and valleys. Just as the ancient poem says, “Above are layered cliffs, below is a deep river; travelers who pass here must find lodging,” the precipitous mountains and rushing rivers set off the majestic and perilous “Lianyun Plank Road” of the ancient plank road.
    It is said that the plank road that Zhang Liang advised King Han, Liu Bang, to burn down during the Chu-Han contention more than two hundred years BC was located here. The lush forests and murmuring streams of Miaotaizi are said to be where Zhang Liang secluded himself and became a monk. There is still a Zhang Liang Temple in the town. Ancient cypresses tower within the temple, and green bamboos line the path. There is also the Sutra Teaching Tower where Zhang Liang studied in those days. When we arrived at Ma Dao (Horse Road), we also made a special visit to the place where Xiao He, the Prime Minister of Han, chased after Han Xin. At the head of the iron cable bridge on the left bank of the Ma Dao River, two stone tablets are erected, one inscribed with "The place where the Han Prime Minister chased Han Xin," and the other with the four characters "Han Stream rises at Night." Legend has it that Han Xin initially failed to gain the trust of Emperor Gaozu of Han and fled from Hanzhong to this place. Because the Ma Dao River rose at night, he could not cross, and was thus caught up by Xiao He and appointed as a general by Emperor Gaozu of Han. To this day, the proverb "If not for the Han Stream rising one night, the Liu Dynasty would not have lasted four hundred years" is still circulating among the people. Below the winding Qipan (Seven-Bend) Mountain is the Shimen (Stone Gate) Cave, which was opened up during the Han Dynasty. The cliffs on both sides are precipitous and the terrain is dangerous. It is said that when Cao Cao sent troops through this plank road, he fell off his horse, and the words "King Wei of Han Rolls in the Snow" are still engraved on the stone wall. Zhuge Liang also passed through this place many times when he sent troops north to attack Wei.
          On the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road
    Leaving the Baohe Gorge, the view suddenly opens up. On the vast and fertile Hanzhong Plain, rivers crisscross, and the fields are full of green rice seedlings. The corn grows as tall as walls. Except for the absence of bamboo forests, the other products and scenery are similar to the Western Sichuan Plain. On the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway lined with weeping willows, vehicles loaded with passengers, goods, and materials to support railway construction shuttle back and forth all day long. Large quantities of grain, timber, and more than 300 kinds of local and special products such as tung oil, raw lacquer, and ramie produced in southern Shaanxi are transported by road to various parts of the country, and some are even sold in the international market. Although the volume of transportation on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway has decreased by 25% since the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the short-distance transportation along the line has greatly increased due to the large amount of materials that need to be concentrated on the railway line. As a highway transportation hub, Hanzhong can reach Laokou in Hubei via Ankang in southern Shaanxi in the east, Chongqing via northern Sichuan in the south, and Tianshui and Lanzhou in Gansu via Shuangshipu and Huixian in the west. The Baoji Transportation Station, which owns 800 vehicles, will also be moved to Hanzhong in the future to expand transportation capacity in this area.
    Located on the edge of the Hanzhong Basin and the Daba Mountains, the ancient Mian County is backed by mountains and faces water, making it a strategic passage for Sichuan-Shaanxi exchanges. The new city, with a population of more than 40,000, has a relatively prosperous commerce and transportation industry. Dingjun Mountain in the south of the city is high and dangerous. Legend has it that during the Three Kingdoms period, Huang Zhong beheaded Xiahou Yuan in front of the mountain, and Liu Bei built an altar in Mian County to declare himself King of Hanzhong. Later, Zhuge Liang was also buried on Dingjun Mountain after his death. The Zhuge Wu Hou Temple and the tomb of Shu general Ma Chao are also preserved along the highway.
    Places the Red Army Passed Through
    From Ningqiang in southern Shaanxi to Guangyuan in Sichuan, passing through the Daba Mountains, which are more than 2,000 meters above sea level, the highway sometimes winds like a ribbon in the valleys, and sometimes spirals around the green peaks. On the cloud-covered hills and between the cliffs, the slogans written by the Red Army in those years, such as "Realize the National Soviet," "Crush the New Offensive, Defend the Autumn Harvest and Planting," and "Develop the Financial Resources of the Soviet Area, Develop Foreign Trade," are still clearly visible. In 1933, when the Sichuan-Shaanxi Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan, they arrived in Guangyuan, Jianmen, Zhaohua and other areas from Tongjiang and Nanjiang. Many of the narrow paths the Red Army once traversed are now places where trains pass. Guangyuan County, where the Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Soviet Government and the Jialing County Workers' and Peasants' Government were once stationed, is the first large county after the railway entered Sichuan. The production of musk, bupleurum, gastrodia elata, wood ear, raw lacquer and hundreds of other local products here has increased after the opening of the railway. The output value of medicinal materials alone has increased by 350,000 yuan compared with three years ago. The long beard grass, which had been abandoned in the past, is now sold to Hunan. New theaters and cinemas have been built in the county seat, and the Guangyuan and Rongshan coal mines have also been expanded. The population of Baolun Courtyard in Zhaohua County, which was just an ordinary small town four years ago where travelers couldn't even find a hotel, has now increased two and a half times after the opening of the railway, becoming a new distribution center for local products and daily necessities.
        Jianmen Mountain Area
    After passing Guangyuan and Zhaohua, when the train enters the Jianmen Mountain area, which stretches for more than a hundred miles along the steep valleys, the view is dominated by towering cliffs and the "Seventy-two Peaks of Jianmen," which soar into the clouds like dozens of sharp swords piercing the blue sky. Below it is the Jianmen Pass, which Du Fu described as "One man guarding the pass in anger, a million cannot approach." The large characters written on the pass, such as "Natural Barrier and Magnificent Plan," "Sichuan Gate Fortress," and "Chang'an in Sight," truly express its majestic momentum. It is said that during the late Three Kingdoms period, the Shu general Jiang Wei relied on this dangerous terrain to resist the Wei soldiers; the temple commemorating him still exists. The Motianling Mountains, which stretch across several provinces, have been regarded as a dreaded place by travelers since ancient times. When the Wei general Deng Ai led his troops to take a shortcut from here and secretly crossed Yinping to raid Western Sichuan, the soldiers wept because the steep cliffs and precipices were impossible to walk on. Deng Ai and his soldiers had to bind themselves with felt shirts and ropes, climb trees, and roll down the mountain rocks.
    However, today, trains pulled by two locomotives travel like swimming dragons through the mountains. Looking up from the train window, one cannot see the top of the mountain; looking down, there is a bottomless abyss. The railway is like a shining black satin, tightly wrapped around the mountainside. The large characters "Heroes emerge in the face of difficulties, good men emerge from narrow riverbanks," which were carved by the road construction workers on the stone walls, shine dazzlingly in front of the passengers' eyes. The line engineering was extremely difficult. Each kilometer of roadbed required an average of more than 80,000 cubic meters of fill, and the most required more than 130,000 cubic meters, which is one or two times more than the amount of work per kilometer on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Just as people were marveling at how the road construction heroes split open the mountains and built this railway on stone walls of dozens or even hundreds of meters high, a comrade from the Second Engineering Bureau who was traveling with us said:
    "The workers conquered Jianmen Mountain with their wisdom and sweat. They often stuck to the cliffs of dozens of meters like geckos, and sometimes they even imitated the method of building ancient plank roads, chiseling stone holes in the rock walls, inserting steel brazes, and building wooden boards to chisel the mountain open in mid-air with one hammer after another. Every step forward here requires a huge price. Young blasting expert Zhang Tingheng and other seven martyrs sacrificed their lives while blasting the dangerous Mingyue Gorge. In order to commemorate them, people have erected a monument and built a cement-filled tomb in the place where the martyrs rest. Many passengers passing by there silently pay their respects to the martyrs!"

    大巴山下
    ——从宝鸡到成都之六
    本报记者　纪希晨
    古栈道
    在南往成都的道路上，我们有时乘着火车，有时乘着汽车，从秦岭和大巴山下的古栈道中穿过。
    从凤县双石铺，沿着川陕公路，向南翻过酒尊梁、紫关岭，经过庙台子、留坝，直到褒城，车子一直穿行在深山峡谷中。正像古诗所写：“上有层岩下深江，过此行人足皆宿”，那险峻的山峰，奔腾的河流，把古栈道“连云栈”衬托得特别雄伟、险要。
    公元前二百多年楚汉相争时，张良曾向汉王刘邦献计火烧的栈道，相传就在这里。林木苍翠，溪流潺潺的庙台子，传说就是张良隐居出家的地方。现在镇上还有张良庙。庙内古柏参天，绿竹夹道，有当年张良读书的授书楼。到了马道，我们还专门参观了汉相国萧何追韩信的地方。马道河左岸的铁索桥头上，竖立着两块石碑，一块写着“汉相国追韩处”；另一块写着“寒溪夜涨”四个大字。相传，韩信起初不得汉高祖的信任，从汉中跑到这里，因马道河水夜涨，没有渡过，才被萧何追回，为汉高祖封为大将。直到现在，民间还流传着“不是寒溪一夜涨，那得刘朝四百年”的谚语。盘绕回转的七盘山下，有汉朝开凿的石门洞，两边悬岩峭壁，形势险要，据说曹操发兵经此栈道时曾滚下马来，至今石壁上还刻有“汉魏王滚雪”的字样。诸葛亮屡次出兵北上伐魏，也都经过这个地方。
          川陕路上
    出了褒河峡谷，眼前豁然开朗，辽阔富饶的汉中平原上，河流纵横，原野上到处是绿色的稻秧，玉蜀黍长得像墙一样。这里除了没有竹林，其他物产风貌，都同川西平原相像。垂柳夹道的川陕公路上，整日穿梭奔驰着满载着客货和支援铁路建设的车辆。陕南出产的大批粮食、木米和桐油、生漆、苎麻等三百多种土、特产品，经公路载运到国内各地，有的还远销国际市场。宝成铁路部分通车营业后，川陕公路的运输量虽比前减少了25％，但是，由于大量物资需要向铁路线集中，因之，沿线短途运输却比以前大为增加了。作为公路交通中心的汉中，东可经陕南安康到湖北老河口，南可经川北到重庆，西可经双石铺、徽县到达甘肃的天水、兰州。拥有八百辆汽车的宝鸡运输站，将来也将移至汉中，扩大这一带的运输力量。
    位于汉中盆地和大巴山边沿的古沔县，背山面水，为川陕交往必经的咽喉。拥有四万多人的新城，商业和运输业相当繁荣。城南的定军山，山势高险，相传在三国的时候，黄忠在山前斩夏侯渊，刘备并筑坛于沔县称汉中王。后来，诸葛亮死后也安葬在定军山。公路上边，还保存有诸葛武侯祠和蜀将马超的坟墓。
    红军走过的地方
    从陕南宁强到四川广元，穿过拔海两千多公尺的大巴山，公路时而带子似的缠绕在山谷中，时而又盘旋在绿色的山峰的上边。在那云雾笼罩的山岗上，岩壁间，当年红军刻写的“实现全国苏维埃”、“粉碎新进攻，保卫秋收秋种”、“开发苏区财源，发展对外贸易”的标语，仍然清晰可见。1933年，川陕工农红军北上抗日时，从通江、南江到达广元、剑门、昭化等一带。当年红军走过的羊肠小道，如今有许多都是火车经过的地方。曾经驻过川陕省苏维埃和嘉陵县工农政府的广元县，是铁路入川后的第一个大县。这里出产的麝香、紫胡、天麻、木耳、生漆等数百种土特产，通车后产量增加了，其中仅药材一项产值就比三年前增加了三十五万元，过去一直被荒废的龙须草，如今远销到湖南。县城内新建了戏院和电影院，广元、荣山两煤矿也进行了扩建。昭化县的宝轮院，四年前还是一个普通的小镇，过路旅客都找不到旅店，可是通车后人口却增加了两倍半，成为新兴的土特产和日用百货的集散地了。
        剑门山区
    过了广元、昭化，当火车沿着陡峭的峡谷，进入绵延百余里的剑门山区时，眼前尽是峭壁千刃的高山，耸入云端的“剑门七十二峰”，像几十只利剑插刺在蓝天的上面。它的下边，就是被杜甫形容为“一夫怒临关，百万未可傍”的剑门关，关上写的“天堑雄图”，“蜀门镇固”、“眼底长安”的大字，真切的道出了它的雄伟气势。据说三国末年，蜀将姜维曾在这里据险抗拒魏兵；纪念他的祠庙至今还在。连绵数省的摩天岭，自古就被行旅视为畏途，魏将邓艾引兵从这里抄小路、偷渡阴平奔袭西川时，士兵因峻壁巅岩，不能行走，尽皆哭泣，邓艾和士兵只得用毡衫绳索，自缚其身，攀木挂树，滚下山岩。
      可是，今天双机牵引的火车，却游龙一般穿行在丛山上。从车窗往上看，仰脸看不见山顶；往下看，万丈深渊。铁路像一条发光的黑缎，紧紧的缠绕在山腰上面。筑路工人在石壁上刻的：“困难面前显英雄，狭窄河岸出好汉”的大字，夺目的闪耀在旅客的眼前。线路工程十分艰难，每公里路基平均要填八万多方，最多的达十三万多方，比京汉路每公里的工程量大一、二十倍。当人们正在惊叹筑路英雄们怎样把高山劈开，在几十丈、甚至几百丈的石壁上，修出了这条铁路的时候，同行的第二施工局的一位同志对我说：
    “工人们用智慧和血汗征服了剑门山。他们常像壁虎一样贴在几十丈的峭壁上面，有时还仿照修古栈道的办法，在岩壁上凿出石洞，插上钢钎，架上木板，在半空中一锤锤把山凿开。在这里每前进一步都要付出巨大的代价。青年爆破手张挺横等七烈士，就是在爆破天险明月峡时牺牲的。为着纪念他们，人们在烈士们安息的地方，立起了纪念碑，修起了水泥灌浇的墓穴，许多旅客乘车经过那里，都默默的向烈士们致敬！”
