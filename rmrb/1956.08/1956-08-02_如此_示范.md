    Such "Demonstration"
    Fan Chang Farm Lags Behind Agricultural Cooperatives
    State-owned farms have better production conditions and higher technology than farmers, but for some reason, our Anhui Province’s Fan Chang County State Farm lags behind the masses in everything.
    This year, the county promoted the superior variety of Shengli rapeseed. The farm planted thirteen mu, but when the rapeseed was flowering and podding, they plowed under nine mu as green manure in a confused manner. The farm's reasoning was: severe lack of seedlings and poor growth. However, the county party committee had repeatedly issued notices to strengthen field management of summer crops, promptly weed and topdress, check seedlings and fill in gaps to ensure full and strong seedlings. The agricultural cooperatives actively acted according to these instructions, but the state-owned farm, which should have set an example, turned a deaf ear.
    This year, the county also vigorously promoted double-cropping rice. Most agricultural cooperatives completed their tasks, but the state-owned farm did not. When asked why they couldn't complete the task, they replied very simply: 30% of the seedlings rotted, and there was no way to complete it. A 30% seedling rot is rare and unheard of in our county this year. If the farmers had such rotten seedlings, they would be extremely anxious, but Fan Chang Farm was neither anxious nor flustered. The farm has technicians, seeds, and fertilizers, so why didn't they actively replant after such severe seedling rot occurred?
    For example, this year our county transferred in 10,000 jin of the superior variety Yinfang rice from outside, and the farmers were willing to accept it. When ten jin of Yinfang rice seeds were distributed to the state-owned farm, they were unwilling to take it.
    This farm not only has these problems in agricultural production, but also many problems in animal husbandry. A Yorkshire Large White pig contracted an infectious disease. They butchered it for more than ninety jin of meat and sold it to farmers at a reduced price on credit. Soon after, the large breeding bull at the breeding station also died of anthrax.
    In short, this state-owned farm has not played a demonstrative role and has even fallen behind the farmers. We hope that Fan Chang Farm will quickly improve its work and truly become a model state-owned farm.

    Hu Li Hai Farm: Seedling Scarcity and Weed Growth
    If you want to visit the Hu Li Hai State Farm in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia, there is a very convenient way to identify it: once you cross the Liao River, in the boundless fields, the most desolate land is all the farm's. This is more accurate than hanging a sign.
    Local farmers ridicule this state-owned farm, saying, "The land where our agricultural cooperative borders the farm's should have a wall built, otherwise, the weeds from the farm's land will blow into the cooperative's land."
    Why has this farm left its land desolate to such an alarming extent? Farm Director Wu said: "The farm's original operating plan was mechanized farming, but the higher authorities abolished 'mechanized farming'... Last year, the farm planted 600 hectares of land, and this year it opened up another 800 hectares of virgin land. Each worker has to do an average of more than six hectares of farm work, which is much more than the agricultural cooperatives."
    Now the seedlings in the agricultural cooperatives are growing luxuriantly, but the small seedlings on the farm are still in the waist-high weeds. The agricultural cooperatives are weeding, but the farm, even after the local party and government organs and schools provided support for weeding, still has 200 hectares of land without seedlings.
    Although we don't know much about the farm's spring reclamation tasks, seeing the weeds in the farm's farmland growing to such an alarming extent is indeed distressing.

    Shayang Farm Disputes Profits with Agricultural Cooperatives
    The Eighth Branch of the Hubei Provincial State-owned Shayang Farm is located in Xingfu Township, Ninth District, Jingmen County. The relationship between this farm and the local agricultural cooperatives is very bad. Liu Kaibang, the director of the Youai Agricultural Cooperative in Xingfu Township, organized two members to go to Zhoujia Lake to fish and engage in sideline production. Zhoujia Lake was originally ownerless, but the Eighth Branch interfered and did not allow fishing, saying that Zhoujia Lake was theirs. What was even more unreasonable was that they took away all of the Youai Cooperative's more than two thousand fish hooks, made the two people stand in the sun for half a day, and destroyed a fishing boat on the lake embankment.
    When members of the worker-peasant cooperative went fishing, the farm also took away their three fishing nets (worth more than 120 yuan).
    In addition, in May, the Eighth Branch put cattle into the Youai Agricultural Cooperative's land, eating 720 seedlings. After this problem occurred, the Jingmen County Party Committee called the Shayang Farm to discuss a solution. The comrades from the farm said: "We are directly under the leadership of Hubei Province and not under the leadership of your county." Up to now, this problem has been unresolved for two months. How the farm should treat the agricultural cooperatives in the future, whether to continue to have these disputes with the agricultural cooperatives, or to discuss and resolve problems properly with the agricultural cooperatives, is something that the farm leaders should seriously consider.

### 如此“示范”

    如此“示范”
    繁昌农场落在农业社后面
    国营农场生产条件比农民好，技术比农民高，但不知道为什么我们安徽省繁昌县国营农场却事事落在群众后面。
    今年全县推广胜利油菜优良品种，农场种植了十三亩，但当油菜开花结角的时候，竟稀里糊涂犁掉九亩作绿肥。农场的道理是：缺苗严重，生长不茂。然而县委曾经几次通知加强夏季作物田间管理，及时除草追肥，查苗补苗，以保证全苗旺苗，农业社都根据这些指示积极行动，有示范作用的国营农场却置若罔闻。
    今年县里又大量推广双季稻。多数农业社都完成了任务，而国营农场却没有完成。问他们为什么不能完成任务，他们答复得很干脆：秧坏了30％，没有办法完成。今年坏秧30％，在我县是少闻罕见的。假如农民烂了这么些秧，那真不知要怎样焦急，繁昌农场却一不急，二不慌。农场有的是技术员，有的是种子、肥料，为什么发生这样严重的烂秧情况而不积极补种呢？
    再如我县今年从外调入一万斤优良品种银坊稻，分给农民都乐意接受。分配十斤银坊稻种给国营农场，他们也不愿意要。
    这个农场不仅在农业生产上有这些问题，在畜牧方面也有不少问题。一只约克夏大白猪得了传染病，他们把它剥了九十多斤肉，降价赊销给农民。不久配种站大种牛也得了炭疽病死了。
    总之，这座国营农场，并没起到示范作用，甚至落在农民后边。我们希望繁昌农场迅速改进工作，真正成为一个示范的国营农场。

    胡力海农场苗荒草长
    如果你要想去内蒙古通辽县胡力海国营农场参观，有一个非常便利的辨认方法：一过辽河，在一望无边的大片田地里，荒得不像样子的地全是农场的，这比挂牌子还准确。
    当地农民这样嘲笑这个国营农场“咱农业社同农场挨垅的地，应当打道墙，要不，农场地的草籽会刮到社的地里来”。
    为什么这个农场把地荒到这种惊人的程度呢？农场吴场长说：“这场的经营计划原是机耕，可是上级把‘机耕’撤消了……去年农场种六百垧地，今年又开了八百垧生荒，每个工人要平均做六垧多地的农活，比农业社多得多。
    现在农业社地里的苗都茂盛地生长着，农场地里的小苗仍在半人高的蒿草中；农业社正在趟地，可是农场呢，在当地党政机关学校增援锄草后，还有二百垧地没开苗。
    尽管我们对农场今春的垦荒任务不怎么了解，但看到农场的庄稼地里荒草长到这种惊人程度，确实感到痛心。

    沙洋农场同农业社争利
    湖北省地方国营沙洋农场第八分场，设立在荆门县九区幸福乡，这农场同当地农业社的关系很不好。幸福乡友爱农业合作社主任刘开榜组织了两个社员到周家湖去捕鱼，搞副业生产，周家湖本是无主的湖，但八分场却出来干涉，不准捕鱼，说周家湖是他们的。更不讲理的是，竟将友爱社下的鱼钩二千多张全部拿走了，把两个人弄在太阳下晒了半天，把一支渔船弄上湖堤破坏了。
    工农社的社员去捕鱼，农场也把他们的三张鱼网拿去了（值一百二十多元）。
    此外，八分场在五月份把牛放到友爱农业社地里，吃了七百二十蔸秧。这一问题发生以后，荆门县委曾给沙洋农场打电话，商量解决，农场的同志说：“我们直属湖北省领导，不属你们县领导。”到现在，这一问题已有两月之久，还不能解决。农场今后究竟怎样对待农业社，是继续同农业社闹这些纠纷好呢，还是同农业社好好商量解决问题好呢？这是农场负责人应当好好考虑的。　（刘士泉）
