Fountain (and another chapter)
—Copied from "My Morin Khuur Song Collection"
Tian Jian
	On the green grass there is a fountain, as white as a jade hairpin flower, that is the pure white spring water, gushing from underground to the surface.
	A shepherdess walks by here, driving her cattle and sheep, she drinks a mouthful of spring water, about to bid farewell to her hometown.
	Right on this pasture, soon a blast furnace will stand tall; next year, or the year after, the first batch of steel will be produced here.
	Shepherdess, behind you, the cranes roar in symphony; shepherdess, in front of you, the Yellow River sends waves.

	In the spring water there is a human figure, as white as a daffodil, that is a shepherdess, she smiles and looks at us.
	When she drinks a mouthful of spring water, she sees her own eyes, still hidden in the water spray, so black and full of affection.
	Shepherdess, please rest assured, the masters of the grassland are the people, no matter where you move to, you are still family here.
	No matter where you go, the sparks are shining on you; the spring water will also flow very far, and follow your footprints.
	Beside the tent, on the green grassland, there is a white tent, it looks like a white sail, sailing far away on the sea.
	A surveying team leader rides a horse, carrying a bag, the bag is filled with ore, returning fully loaded, jingling all over.
	Girls come out of the tent, plucking the strings of their instruments, welcoming the people returning from afar!
	Cheer for him, wish him good health!

    喷泉（外一章）
    ——抄自“我的马头琴歌集”
    田间
    一青草上有一道喷泉，白得像玉簪花一样，那是洁白的泉水，从地下喷射到地上。牧羊女走过这里，赶着她的牛和羊，她喝了一口泉水，要告别她的故乡。就在这一块牧场上，不久高炉就要立起；明年，或者是后年，这里要出第一炉钢。牧羊女，她的背后，起重机轰隆地交响；牧羊女，她的前面，黄河送来了波浪。
    二泉水里有一个人影，白得像水仙一样，那是一位牧羊女，她微笑着望着我们。当她喝下一口泉水，她看见自己的眼睛，还藏在水花里面，是那样的乌黑、深情。牧羊女啊请你放心，草原的主人是人民，不论你迁居到哪里，你还是这里的亲人。不论你往哪里走，火花在照耀你们；泉水也会流得很远，会跟着你的脚印。在帐篷边在青青的草原上，有一顶白的篷帐，它好像白的船帆，正在大海上远航。勘探队长骑着一匹马，身上挂着一个行囊，行囊里装的是石矿，满载而归全身叮当。姑娘们走出帐篷来，把手上的琴弦拨响，迎接远方归来的人！为他欢呼，祝他健康！
