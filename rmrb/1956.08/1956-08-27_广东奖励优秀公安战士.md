Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 25th: Eighty-six outstanding public security fighters who have been stationed for a long time along the coast and inland areas of Guangdong Province, received various awards at the Representative Conference of Activists of the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Guangzhou area, which closed on the 21st.

　　Liu Jusen, a new soldier who joined the Public Security Forces last year, has become an outstanding border guard in less than a year, and was rewarded at this conference. He can spot distant targets with his eyes in the dark night, and distinguish various subtle sounds with his ears. He has captured seven criminals who illegally crossed the border. Once, when Liu Jusen was patrolling on a windy and rainy night, he noticed that the incessant croaking of frogs ahead suddenly stopped, and he immediately concluded that the frogs had been disturbed. He calmly and vigilantly monitored the movement ahead, and sure enough, he found three shadows flashing. He then quietly searched through the bushes and finally caught the three fugitives.

　　Also receiving awards at this conference were the soldiers of the 3rd Platoon of the 1st Company of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces, who relied on the masses in remote mountainous areas to capture and annihilate airborne special agents, and Li Zihui, an inspector at a certain border station, who successively captured more than 40 counter-revolutionary criminals who attempted to sneak into the country and flee abroad. They were all awarded the honorary titles of "Duty Expert," "Excellent Shooter," and "Technical Expert" at the conference.

    广东奖励优秀公安战士
    新华社广州25日电　八十六位长期驻守在广东省沿海和内地的优秀的公安战士，在21日闭幕的中国人民解放军公安军驻广州地区部队积极分子代表大会上，分别获得各种奖励。
    去年应征参加公安军的新战士刘巨森，入伍不到一年，就已成为一个出色的边防战士，在这次大会上受到了奖励。他能够在漆黑的夜晚用眼睛发现远方的目标，用耳朵分辨出各种细微的声音，先后捕获了七个偷越国境的罪犯。有一次，刘巨森在刮风下雨的黑夜里巡逻的时候，他发觉前面喧闹不休的青蛙叫声突然中断，便立刻断定青蛙受到了惊扰。他沉着机警地监视着前面的动静，果然发现有三个人影在闪动。他接着悄悄地从草丛中搜索过去，终于把那三个逃犯捉住了。
    在这个大会上获奖的，还有在偏僻山区依靠群众捕捉和歼灭空降特务的公安军某部一连三排的战士，先后捕获企图潜入国境和潜逃国外的反革命罪犯四十多名的边防某站检查员李梓惠等人。他们都在大会上分别获得执勤能手、优等射手和技术能手的光荣称号。
