Xinhua News Agency, August 17th dispatch from Athens: Egyptian President's Office Political Bureau Director Sabri told reporters in Athens on August 16th, on his way to London, that Egypt would reject any decision aimed at establishing "international control" over the Suez Canal. He said: "Any decision of the (London) conference that involves Egyptian sovereignty will not be accepted by Egypt. Egypt will abide by the 1888 Convention and is prepared to sign a bilateral or collective agreement on guaranteeing the freedom of navigation on the canal and its passage fees."

When talking about his mission to London, Sabri said that his mission was not to be "an observer" at the London conference. He "will stay at the Egyptian Embassy, watch the development of the conference, and report directly to President Nasser." He also said that if he was asked, he would be willing to provide the conference with any information about the nationalization of the canal company. But he does not intend to take the initiative to make contacts there.

When asked if Egypt intended to blow up the canal in the event of an attack, Sabri replied: "Everything is possible, because that would be a major war." But he went on to say that he did not think war was likely because world opinion opposed the use of force.

He said he was pleased that Greece boycotted the London conference.

There are also reports that Sabri arrived in London on the evening of August 16. At a press conference held after his arrival in London, he emphasized: "We insist that we should have sole control over the canal and its economy. If (foreign countries) use force, we will defend ourselves." He said that other countries "are just customers, who only have the right to buy things in a store, and no more rights than that."

When asked if the London conference would have good results, he replied: "Possibly."

At the same time, he said that Egypt "will not participate under any circumstances" in this meeting. He said: "We will participate" in another meeting, "if this meeting is convened according to the guidelines suggested by (Nasser) President. However, there cannot be any discrimination on the question of who can or cannot participate."

    萨布里经雅典和到伦敦时发表谈话
    不容干涉埃及对运河的主权
    新华社17日讯　雅典消息：埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里八月十六日在前往伦敦途经雅典的时候向记者发表谈话说，埃及将拒绝以建立对苏彝士运河的“国际管理”为目的的任何决定。他说：“（伦敦）会议的任何涉及埃及主权的决定是不会被埃及接受的，埃及将遵守1888年公约，并且准备签订一项关于保证这条运河的自由通航和它的通行费的双边协定或者集体协定。”
    萨布里谈到他去伦敦的任务的时候说，他的任务不是做伦敦会议的“一个观察员”。他“将留在埃及大使馆，注视会议的发展，并且直接向纳赛尔总统报告”。他还说，如果他被要求，他愿意向会议提供有关运河公司国有化的任何材料。但是他不打算主动在那里进行联系。
    有人问，万一埃及受到进攻是不是打算炸毁运河，萨布里回答说：“一切可能性都有，因为这将是大战。”但是他接着又说，他认为战争不可能发生，因为世界舆论反对使用武力。
    他说，他对于希腊抵制伦敦会议感到满意。
    另外还有消息说，萨布里已经在八月十六日晚上到达伦敦。他在到达伦敦后举行的记者招待会上强调说：“我们坚持我们应该有对运河及其经济的唯一控制权。如果（外国）使用武力，我们就将保卫自己。”他说，其他的国家只“是顾客，只具有一个到商店里买东西的人那样的权利，而没有更多的权利。”
    有人问，伦敦会议是不是会有好的结果。他回答说：“可能。”
    同时，他又说，埃及“在任何情况下都不会参加”这个会议。他说：“我们将参加”另一次会议，“如果这个会议是根据（纳赛尔）总统建议的方针而召开的。不过，在谁可以参加或不可以参加的问题上，不能有任何歧视。”
