Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 27th. Gansu Province is building a number of modern new cities. There are currently five modern cities in the province that are being planned, surveyed, or expanded on their original foundations. Some cities will be built in wilderness and on the Gobi Desert.

Lanzhou, a city with more than 2,000 years of history, is now undergoing large-scale reconstruction. People who visited Lanzhou in the past two years simply don't recognize this ancient and reborn city. Near the railway station, in the eastern suburbs, huge building complexes are growing like mushrooms after a rain. The urban area, which is more than sixty kilometers long, has a construction area of about 1.1 to 1.2 million square meters this year. Lanzhou used to have only one Yellow River iron bridge, but now it has increased to four.

On the rich Hexi Corridor, there are three cities being built and surveyed along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Huangyang Town near Wuwei County will become one of the cultural centers of Gansu Province. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary College, Animal Husbandry Technical School, and Water Conservancy School are being built here, and some factory sites have also been selected here. Zhangye County, located in the rich Heihe River basin, used to be called "Silver Zhangye." Now, construction has begun in the old county town and the nearby Gobi Desert. Jiuquan County, near Jiayuguan, is currently conducting topographic surveys prior to urban planning. This city, praised by ancient poets with the lines "grape wine, luminous cups," will have many large chimneys in the future and become one of Gansu Province's industrial bases.

Some new cities will also be built along the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. The Baigen City, which has already started construction, is more than eighty kilometers away from Lanzhou. It was originally a barren mountain, but now houses are being built on a large scale according to urban planning, roads are being opened up, and water supply pipelines more than twenty kilometers long are being laid.

According to the person in charge of the Gansu Provincial Urban Construction Bureau, there are still many difficulties in the construction of these new cities, such as insufficient technical force and a lack of equipment, building materials, and transportation. At present, the Construction Bureau has only a few urban planners, not a single hydrogeologist, and even car drivers are insufficient. It still needs strong support from other places.

The pipeline project of the Lanzhou Refinery is one of the most complex projects that has already started; if all the pipelines were connected in a single straight line, it would be equivalent to the distance from Lanzhou to Xi'an. This is a corner of the pipeline project area. Sima (Gansu Daily News Agency draft)

### 随着工业建设和交通运输的发展  甘肃古老的名城正在新生  荒野和戈壁滩上也将出现一批现代化城市

    随着工业建设和交通运输的发展
    甘肃古老的名城正在新生
    荒野和戈壁滩上也将出现一批现代化城市
    新华社兰州27日电　甘肃省正在建设一批现代化的新城市。现在全省正在有计划地进行建设、勘测或在原有基础上进行扩充的现代化城市共有五座，有些城市将要建筑在荒野和戈壁滩上。
    建城已经有两千多年历史的兰州——现在正在大规模地进行重新建设。在前两年曾到过兰州的人现在简直就不认识这个古老而又新生的城市了。靠近火车站的东郊一带，庞大的建筑群正像雨后春笋一样地成长起来。长达六十多公里的市区，今年约有一百几十万平方公尺的建筑面积。从前兰州只有一座黄河铁桥，现在已经增加到四座。
    在富饶的河西走廊上，沿兰新铁路线正在建设和勘测的有三座城市。武威县城附近的黄羊镇将要变成甘肃省的文化中心之一，畜牧兽医学院、畜牧技术学校、水利学校等正在这里建筑校舍，有些工厂的厂址也已经在这里选定了。处在富饶的黑河流域的张掖县过去被叫做“银张掖”，现在在旧县城和附近的戈壁上已经铺开了建设的场面。嘉峪关附近的酒泉县城，现在正在进行城市规划前的地形测量工作。这座古代诗人曾以“葡萄美酒夜光杯”的诗句赞美过的城市，今后将要出现许多大烟囱，成为甘肃省的工业基地之一。
    在包兰铁路线上也要建设一些新的城市，现在已经动工建设的白艮市距兰州八十多公里。那里原来是一片荒山，目前正按照城市规划大批地建筑房屋，开拓马路，敷设长达二十多公里的供水管道。
    据甘肃省城市建设局负责人说，这些新城市在建设过程中还有很多困难，例如技术力量不足，设备、建筑材料和交通工具都感缺乏。现在建设局只有少数的城市规划人员，水文地质人员一个也没有，甚至汽车驾驶员都感到不够，还需要外地的大力支援。（附图片）
