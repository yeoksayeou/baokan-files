    Tokyo Dispatch: Development of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Movement in Tokyo
    Lan Hai
    Chiyoda Ward is the central district of Tokyo. The Japanese Imperial Palace, the Diet, and the Prime Minister's official residence are all located in this ward. From July 21st to 23rd this year, the song "Tokyo-Beijing" echoed from the newly built auditorium of the Chiyoda Ward Office. The song crossed the dark green moats and high stone walls, spreading into the pine forests within the Imperial Palace. More than 300 representatives from all over Japan gathered here to hold the 6th National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association.
    The mayor of Chiyoda Ward, Murase, is also the president of the Chiyoda Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association. He addressed the conference on behalf of the people of the ward, saying, "I sincerely respect the leaders of the new China who are practicing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. I and our ward residents feel honored that the 6th National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association can be held in the newly built ward office auditorium in our ward."
    The conference received hundreds of congratulatory telegrams from local autonomous bodies such as prefectures, cities, towns, and villages throughout the country, from various people's organizations led by trade unions, and from members of the Diet. There were also warm congratulations from Chinese people's organizations and peace organizations in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, New Zealand, and Czechoslovakia.
    During the three-day meeting, representatives from all walks of life across the country eagerly requested to speak, expressing their joy at the growth of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people over the past year.
    The representatives enthusiastically discussed the increasingly frequent mutual visits between the people of China and Japan. Nobuo Shioya, vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that more than 500 Japanese trade union representatives had visited China. Recently, they established the "China Visiting Workers' Roundtable Conference" to carry out activities to ensure that the friendship agreement signed by the workers' organizations of Japan and China can be realized on the basis of the united solidarity of all Japanese workers. Shioya also pointed out that it is abnormal to have to detour from Beijing to Japan. He believes that directly connecting Tokyo and Beijing is the mission of the Japanese people.
    Masami Tani, managing director of the Japan Youth Group Council, which has 4.5 million members, reported to the conference that 22 youth representatives would soon visit China. These youth representatives will consult with the broad masses of Japanese youth before departing. In every prefecture, youth organizations from cities, towns, and villages will hold several meetings to discuss what gifts they will bring to the Chinese youth and what issues they hope to discuss with them.
    Representatives from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kyoto, and other places happily reported on the warm reception of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, the Chinese Scientific Delegation, and the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe by the Japanese people, as well as the enormous impact these visits, performances, and exhibitions had on the Japanese masses. The Mayor of Okayama City, Tabuchi, said that the Okayama Prefecture people have always been proud of its scenic spot, Korakuen Garden, which now has red-crowned cranes not seen for thirty years. This was a gift from Mr. Guo Moruo to the Japanese people after his visit to Japan. Masafumi Seki, a representative of the Fukuoka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said that when Mr. Guo Moruo visited his alma mater, Kyushu University, last year, he gave a speech saying, "I learned four things at my alma mater, Kyushu University: love of country, love of the people, love of truth, and love of peace." This sentence deeply touched the hearts of the citizens of Fukuoka. Mr. Guo Moruo has now become an "unforgettable person" for the citizens of Fukuoka. The exhibition of Chinese commodities in Japan has brought great hope to the Japanese business community, which is in urgent need of developing foreign trade. Seki said that on May 3rd this year, when the Japanese ship "Daiichi Unyo Maru" loaded with 5,000 tons of fertilizer powder went to China, many people in Fukuoka City went to the port to see it off.
    Representatives from Hokkaido and other places described the enthusiasm of people there who traveled long distances by train to appreciate the performances of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe. They proposed that the next time a Chinese art troupe comes to Japan, it must perform in various parts of eastern and northern Japan.
    Now, striving to go to China for friendly visits has become the most interesting thing for people of all classes in Japan. Okayama Mayor Tabuchi said: "'We want to be friends with the Chinese people' has become the call of the people of the entire Okayama Prefecture and Okayama City." The Okayama City Council recently unanimously passed a resolution to send a delegation to visit China. And it is determined to work together with local autonomous bodies across the country to promote friendly exchanges between China and Japan. Led by the six major cities, more than 20 prefectural and municipal autonomous bodies across the country hope to exchange visiting delegations with China. The governors of Mie Prefecture and Chiba Prefecture, and the governor of Osaka Prefecture have taken the lead in requesting the government to issue exit visas to delegations visiting China.
    Suggestions for promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges were also put forward at the conference like "a hundred flowers blooming". Kenzo Nakajima, chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, reported that they will hold a Chinese art exhibition in Japan this autumn or next spring. The painter Jinjiro Takamatsu proposed that during this exhibition, Chinese artist representatives should be invited to participate. Kanzo Uchiyama, vice president of the Japan-China Friendship Association, reported that when the exhibition commemorating the 450th anniversary of the death of Japanese painter Sesshu is held in Beijing this August, Japan will send three painters, Hoshun Yamaguchi, Meiji Hashimoto, and Momoo Kitagawa, to China on behalf of the Japanese art world to participate in the exhibition. Makoto Ueno of the Japan Print Association introduced the situation of the Chinese Artists Association holding Japanese print exhibitions many times in various parts of China. He said that there have been many requests in various parts of Japan to hold Chinese print exhibitions.
    Representatives such as the Buddhist priest Noritaka Nakano of the Japan-China Buddhist Exchange Association spoke about the exhibition of Buddhist art pictures of Maijishan and Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves presented by the Chinese Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries to the Japan-China Friendship Association, which were held in Tokyo and Kyoto. They expressed that Japanese Buddhist representatives are eagerly hoping to visit China and go on pilgrimages to temples and Buddhist sites in various parts of China. Ms. Kiyoko Takeda, who returned from a visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese Christian Church, reported in detail on the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christians that she had personally witnessed. She eagerly hopes that Christians in Japan and China can visit each other.
    Ms. Haniko Hani, a representative of the Japan Society for the Protection of Children, hopes to exchange compositions of children from China and Japan. Akio Saito, an assistant professor at Hokkaido University, hopes to realize extensive mutual contact between teachers, students, mothers, and even children in China and Japan.
    At the same time as the opening of the Japan-China Friendship Association Conference, two exhibitions were held in Tokyo—the Japanese Children's Picture Exhibition and the Women's Clothing Handicraft Exhibition. The exhibits of these two exhibitions are planned to be exhibited at the Japanese Commodity Exhibition held in Beijing and Shanghai this autumn, and will be presented to children and women in China. The former was drawn by children from all over Japan wholeheartedly for the Chinese children. The latter was made by members of forty women's organizations in Japan working together. Among them were the hanging paintings dyed by Kinpo Konishi, an 86-year-old dyer from Nishinomiya City, and the exquisite handicrafts made by teenage girls.
    In order to promote scientific and technological exchanges between China and Japan, this conference decided to separate the scientific and technological work from the original cultural and artistic group of the Japan-China Friendship Association and establish a separate scientific and technological exchange group. This was proposed based on the new situation in which the Japanese academic community requested to strengthen scientific and technological exchanges between China and Japan after the visit of the Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan last year. This institution has appointed Yagichi Noguchi, a professor in the Department of Agriculture at the University of Tokyo, and Hidehiko Tamaki, a professor in the Department of Physics, as organizers, and has received the support of many scholars and professors throughout the country, led by Dr. Hideki Yukawa. More than 30 scientists who participated in this conference concluded: "Scientific and technological exchange between China and Japan is an indispensable part of the progress of Japanese science and technology. China's great construction is a guarantee of peace in Asia, and it is an honor for Japanese scholars to be able to assist in this work."
    During the conference, Toshitaro Kuniyoshi, the general representative of the first batch of Japanese war criminals who had been leniently treated by the Chinese government and returned home on July 3, reported with tears in his eyes on the humane treatment they had received in China and their gratitude to the Chinese people. Kuniyoshi said, "From the point of view of the crimes we committed, it would be right to sentence us to any serious crime. We are also human beings, and how can our conscience not be awakened under such humane treatment and leniency." The conference passed a resolution amid a moving storm of applause, expressing heartfelt thanks to Premier Zhou Enlai and the Red Cross Society of China.
    Through these three days of discussions, the representatives unanimously believed that in order to achieve peace in Asia and independence for Japan, one of the central tasks at present is to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. After heatedly discussing various issues related to the normalization of diplomatic relations, the representatives unanimously adopted a number of resolutions requesting the government to negotiate with China on the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations between China and Japan, demanding the complete lifting of the embargo, turning the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement into a government-to-government agreement, and demanding that the government abolish restrictions on exit visas. It was also decided to petition various government departments to request the realization of these resolutions.

    东京通讯日中友好运动的发展
    蓝海
    千代田区是东京的中心区。日本的皇宫、国会和首相官邸都在这个区内。今年七月二十一日到二十三日，从千代田区区政府新建的大礼堂里，传出来了“东京——北京”大合唱的歌声。歌声越过暗绿色的城濠和高高的石墙，扩散到皇宫内的松林中。来自日本各地的三百多名代表，在这里举行了日中友好协会第六届全国大会。
    千代田区区长村濑，就是日中友好协会的千代田分会会长。他在大会上代表这个区人民致词说：“我从内心尊敬实践着和平共处五项原则的新中国的领袖。我和我们的区民对于日中友好协会的第六届全国大会能在本区新建的区政府礼堂内召开，感到光荣。”
    大会收到了几百封贺电，它们来自全国各地的县、市、町、村地方自治机关，来自以工会为首的各人民团体，来自国会议员们。还有从中国各人民团体和英、美、法、苏、新西兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国的和平团体发来的热烈的祝词。
    在三天的会议上，来自全国各界各阶层的代表们，争先恐后地要求发言，以表达他们对于过去一年间中日两国人民友谊的增长所感到的喜悦。
    代表们热烈地谈到了中日两国人民日益频繁地相互访问的情况。日本工会总评议会副主席盐谷信雄说，曾到中国访问过的日本工会代表，已经超过五百人了。最近，他们成立了“访中工人恳谈会”的组织，以便开展活动，促使日、中两国工人团体所签订的友好协定能在全日本工人一致团结的基础上得以实现。盐谷信雄并提出，现在从北京到日本去，必须绕道而行，这种情况是不正常的。他认为把东京和北京直接连接起来，这是日本人民的使命。
    拥有四百五十万会员的日本青年团协议会常务理事谷正己向大会报告，最近将有二十二名青年代表去访问中国。这些青年代表将和广大日本青年协商后才动身。在每一个县份里，从市、町、村的青年组织，都要召开好几次会议，讨论他们给中国的青年带去什么礼物，希望和中国青年谈些什么问题。
    来自东京、大阪、名古屋、京都等地的代表，兴高采烈地报告了日本人民先后欢迎中国商品展览会、中国科学代表团和中国京剧团的热烈情况，以及这些访问、演出和展览在日本群众中所留下的巨大影响。冈山市市长田渊说，冈山县人民一向引以自豪的名胜——后乐园里，现在又有了三十年看不见的丹顶鹤了。这就是郭沫若先生访日后赠送给日本人民的。日中友好协会福冈县联合会的代表关正文说，去年郭沫若先生在访问他的母校九州大学时发表谈话说：“我过去在我的母校九州大学，学到了四件事，这就是：爱祖国、爱人民、爱真理和爱和平。”这句话深深地打动了福冈市民的心。郭沫若先生现在已经成为福冈市民的“忘不掉的人”了。中国商品展览会在日本的展出，给急需发展对外贸易的日本工商界带来了巨大的希望。关正文说，今年五月三日日本轮船“第一云洋丸”载着五千吨肥田粉去中国时，福冈市许多人都到港口去送行。
    来自北海道等处的代表，叙述了他们那里的人们不远千里地乘火车赶去欣赏中国京剧团表演的热情。他们提议，在下一次中国艺术团来日本的时候，一定要到东部和北部日本各地去公演。
    现在，争取到中国去进行友好访问，在日本已成为各阶层人民最感兴趣的事。冈山市长田渊说：“‘我们要和中国人做朋友’这句话，已经成为全冈山县和冈山市人民的呼声。”冈山市议会最近一致通过决议，准备派遣代表团访问中国。并且下了决心，要和全国各地的地方自治机关共同努力，促进中日两国的友好往来。以六大都市为首，全国已经有二十多个县、市的自治机关希望和中国交换访问代表团。三重县和千叶县的县知事，大阪府的府知事，已经带头向政府提出请求，要求发给访问中国的代表团以出国签证。
    要求促进日中文化交流的建议，在大会上也像“百花齐放”一样被提了出来。日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏报告说，在今年秋天或是明年春天，他们将在日本举办中国美术展览会。画家高松甚二郎就提议，要在这一次的展览期间，邀请中国的美术家代表来参加。日中友好协会副会长内山完造报告说，当今年八月在北京举办纪念日本画家雪舟逝世四百五十周年的展览会时，日本将派遣山口逢春、桥本明治、北川桃雄三位画家代表日本画坛赴中国参加这次展览。日本版画协会的上野诚介绍了中国美术家协会在中国各地多次举办日本版画展览的情形。他说，在日本各地也纷纷提出了要求举办中国版画展览的希望。
    日中佛教交流协会的中野教笃法师等代表，谈到了东京和京都等地举办的由中国对外文化协会赠送给日中友好协会的麦积山和敦煌千佛洞等佛教美术图片展览会的情况。他们表示，日本佛教代表们都热烈希望去访问中国，到中国的各地庙宇和佛教胜地去巡礼。应中国基督教教会的邀请，访问中国归来的武田清子女士详细地报告了她所亲自见闻的中国基督教徒的三自爱国运动。她热烈期望日中两国的基督教徒能够互相访问。
    日本保卫儿童会代表羽仁说子女士希望交换日中两国儿童的作文。北海道大学的斋藤秋男助教希望能够实现日中两国的教师、学生、母亲以至于孩子的广泛相互接触。
    和日中友好协会大会开幕的同时，在东京举办了两个展览会——日本儿童图画展览会和妇女服装手工艺品展览会。这两个展览会的展览品，都预备今年秋天在北京、上海举办的日本商品展览会上展出，并赠送给中国的儿童和妇女。前者是日本各地的孩子们一心一意地为中国的小朋友们画出来的。后者是由日本妇女界四十个团体的成员共同努力制作出来的。其中有西宫市八十六岁的印染师小西绢甫所染的挂画，也有十多岁的少女所做的精致的手工艺品。
    为了促进日中两国的科学技术交流，这次大会决定，从日中友好协会原有的文化艺术小组内，把科学技术工作分开来，单独成立了一个科学技术交流小组。这是根据去年中国科学代表团访日以后，日本学术界要求加强日中两国科学技术交流的新情况提出来的。这个机构，已推定东京大学农学系教授野口弥吉、物理系教授玉木英彦等为筹备人，并且得到了以汤川秀树博士为首的全国的许多学者和教授们的赞助。参加这次大会的三十多名科学家得出结论说：“日中两国科学技术的交流，对于日本科学技术的进步是不可缺少的一环。中国的伟大建设是对亚洲和平的保证，日本学者能够协助这件工作，是他们的光荣。”
    在大会进行期间，受到中国政府的宽大处理、于七月三日回国的第一批日本战争犯罪分子的总代表国友俊太郎，在大会上流着眼泪，报告了他们在中国所受到的人道待遇和他们对中国人民的感激。国友俊太郎说，“从我们所犯的罪行来说，判处我们任何严重罪刑都是应该的。我们也是人，在受到这样的人道待遇和宽大处理的情况下，我们的良心怎么能不被唤醒过来呢。”大会在令人感动的暴风雨般的掌声中通过决议，向周恩来总理和中国红十字会表示衷心的感谢。
    通过这三天的讨论，代表们一致地认为，为了亚洲的和平和日本的独立，当前的中心任务之一就是要促进日中两国的邦交正常化。代表们在热烈地讨论了有关邦交正常化的各个问题后，一致通过了要求政府就日中邦交正常化的问题和中国进行谈判、要求全面解除禁运、把日中渔业协定变为政府之间的协定、要求政府取消出国签证的限制等多项决议，并决定向政府各部请愿，要求实现这些决议。
