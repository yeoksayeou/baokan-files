　　Advocate “Visiting the Wise and Asking About Suffering”

　　The Yunnan Daily published an editorial on July 12th entitled "Advocate 'Visiting the Wise and Asking About Suffering'." The editorial said: A dangerous tendency that runs counter to the Party's mass line is currently growing in some rural Party organizations and among some cadres. They think that "since collectivization has been achieved, the peasant masses are very obedient, and things are easy to handle." They even think that "the masses have no difficulties." Thus, a simple command-style approach to work and a tendency to disregard the suffering of the masses have emerged, fostering bureaucracy, commandism, and a style of work that is divorced from the masses.

　　The editorial pointed out: After collectivization, only by adhering to the tradition of the mass line, caring more about the suffering of the masses, paying more attention to supporting and promoting advanced things and creations among the masses, and paying more attention to developing the wisdom of the masses can we maintain and continue to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Otherwise, the enthusiasm of the masses will be hurt in both tangible and intangible ways. Therefore, we must advocate "visiting the wise and asking about suffering," implement the mass line, and oppose bureaucracy, commandism, and all manifestations of being divorced from the masses.

　　The editorial concluded: County and district Party committees should actively help township branches establish good work styles. Some bad things come from above, such as: not explaining policies, only being obsessed with pushing tasks downward, layer upon layer, lacking investigation and research, and the habitual practice of generalized leadership becoming the norm. These things should be thoroughly corrected from above.

### 提倡“访贤问苦”

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    提倡“访贤问苦”
    七月十二日的云南日报以“提倡‘访贤问苦’”为题发表了社论。社论说：在若干农村党组织和干部中当前正滋长着一种与党的群众路线相违背的危险倾向。他们以为“已经合作化了，农民群众都很听话，事情好办了。”甚至以为“群众没有什么困难了”。于是产生了简单的命令行事和不问群众疾苦的思想倾向，滋长了官僚主义、命令主义、脱离群众的作风。
    社论指出：合作化以后，坚持群众路线的传统，更加关心群众疾苦，更加重视支持和推广群众中的先进事物和创造，更加重视发扬群众的智慧，才能保持和继续提高群众的积极性和创造性。否则，就会有形和无形地挫伤群众的积极性。为此，要提倡“访贤问苦”，贯彻群众路线，反对官僚主义、命令主义和一切脱离群众的表现。
    社论最后指出：县、区党委应积极帮助乡支部树立良好的作风。有些不好的东西是从上面来的，如：不交代政策，只醉心于把任务往下压，一层层地压，缺乏调查研究，一般化的领导积习成风。对于这些，应该从上面加以彻底改正。
