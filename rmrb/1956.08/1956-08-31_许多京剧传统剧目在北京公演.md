    Many Traditional Peking Opera Pieces Performed Publicly in Beijing

    (Our report) Recently, a large number of traditional Peking Opera pieces that have not been staged for a long time have been continuously performed on the stages of various theaters in Beijing. The re-staging of these old plays, which actors love to perform and audiences love to watch, has reversed the situation of repertoire depletion that has persisted for many years and has broken various rules and regulations for evaluating repertoire. The attendance rate of each theater has also generally increased.

    Ma Lianliang, a famous Peking Opera actor, has seen all the tickets for each performance of his signature play "A Pot of Snow" sold out early since its public performance. His realistic performance method in this play has won unanimous praise from the audience. At present, Ma Lianliang is sorting out another play, "The Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," which has not been staged for a long time before liberation. Shang Xiaoyun recently staged "Qin Ying's Expedition to the West," an old play that has not been performed for fifteen years. "A Bolt of Cloth" ("Zhang Gudong Borrows a Wife"), co-starred by Xiao Cuihua and Ma Fulu, is recognized by the audience as an excellent farce discovered recently, and its theme and performance methods should be re-evaluated. The veteran artist Xiao Changhua believes that the playwright of "A Bolt of Cloth" is a very talented comedy master. "Si Lang Visits His Mother," starring Zhang Junqiu, and "Luoma Lake," starring Li Wanchun, are also recent repertoires that have been enthusiastically welcomed by audiences in the capital. The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe led by Li Wanchun is successively preparing to rehearse nearly twenty traditional repertoires such as "The Birthday Escort," "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma," and "Flogging the Inspector." Xu Donglai and Xu Dongming recently performed the old play "Yanmen Pass" (i.e., "North-South Combination"). After returning from Hong Kong, the famous Peking Opera actors Tan Fuying and Qiu Shengrong are sorting out their signature plays "Sangyuan寄子" (lit. "The Orphan寄子 from Mulberry Garden") and "Lianhuan Tao" ("Linked Plots"), etc., and these plays will also be performed publicly soon.

    In order to conduct the work of excavating and sorting out the traditional repertoire in a guided manner, the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Directing Committee has selected a batch of traditional repertoire for trial performances since May this year. Because the legacy of opera and drama is mainly preserved in the actors, all the participants in the trial performances are famous actors and veteran artists. So far, more than 20 plays such as "Si Lang Visits His Mother," "Zhuliang Village," "Meilong Town," and "Wang Baochuan" have been tried out. After these plays have been initially revised by the artists, they will be publicly performed. Each theater troupe is preparing to widely solicit public opinions during the performance and then make further revisions.

    许多京剧传统剧目在北京公演
    本报讯　在北京各剧院的舞台上，最近连续演出了大批久未上演的京剧传统剧目。这些艺人爱演、观众爱看的老戏的重新上演扭转了多年来剧目枯窘的局面，打破了衡量剧目的各种清规戒律，各剧院的上座率也普遍提高。
    著名京剧演员马连良的拿手好戏“一捧雪”公演以来，每一场的戏票都是早早预售一空。他在这出戏中的现实主义的表演方法，获得了观众的一致赞扬。目前马连良正在整理另一个在解放以前就久未上演的剧目“三顾茅庐”。尚小云最近上演了十五年未演的老戏“秦英征西”。筱翠花和马富禄合演的“一匹布”（张古董借妻）被观众公认是最近发掘的一出优秀闹剧，对于它的主题思想和表演方法都应得到重新估价。老艺人萧长华认为，“一匹布”的剧作者是一位极有才能的喜剧大师。张君秋主演的“四郎探母”和李万春主演的“落马湖”也是最近受到首都观众热烈欢迎的剧目。李万春领导的北京市京剧一团陆续准备排演的传统剧目还有“生辰纲”、“张汶祥刺马”、“鞭打督邮”等近二十个。徐东来和徐东明最近演出了老戏“雁门关”（即“南北合”）。著名京剧演员谭富英和裘盛戎从香港回来以后，正在整理他们的拿手戏“桑园寄子”、“连环套”等，这几个戏不久也要公演。
    为了有领导地进行挖掘和整理传统剧目的工作，北京市戏曲编导委员会从今年五月起，选择了一批传统剧目进行试演。因为戏曲的遗产主要是保留在艺人身上，所以参加试演的都是著名演员和老艺人。到目前为止已经试演了“四郎探母”、“珠帘寨”、“梅龙镇”、“王宝钏”等二十多出戏。这些戏经过艺人们初步修改以后，即行公演。各剧团准备在演出中广泛听取群众意见，然后再作进一步的修改。
