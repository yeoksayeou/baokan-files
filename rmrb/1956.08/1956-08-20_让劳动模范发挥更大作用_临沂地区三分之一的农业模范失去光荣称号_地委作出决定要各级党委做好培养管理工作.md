Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, August 19th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yuming): How can we strengthen the cultivation of agricultural labor models and give play to their roles so that they truly become the backbone figures in building a new socialist countryside? The Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province recently discussed this issue and made a decision.

In recent years, the Linyi region has produced 5,295 advanced figures in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and other fields who have attended labor model conferences at or above the county level. However, among these people, 1,905 have now lost the honorary title of labor model, and many others, although they still retain the title of labor model, are no longer playing the role of labor model. At the same time, the phenomena of being detached from the masses and falsely reporting achievements exist to varying degrees among a considerable number of model figures.

How is this situation caused? The Prefectural Committee believes in the discussion that neglecting the cultivation and education of model figures is the most important reason for this situation. Only using them, not cultivating them, only paying attention to the technical experience of model figures, not paying attention to their political and ideological situation, only praising their achievements and advantages, and not carrying out political and ideological education and necessary criticism, are serious shortcomings that currently exist universally. As a result, many model figures have gradually developed complacency and arrogance. They look down on grassroots rural cadres and surrounding agricultural cooperatives, do not humbly learn from the experiences of others, and the distance between them and the masses is growing. Individual model figures have even developed from arrogance to corruption and degeneration. The Prefectural Committee also pointed out in the discussion that the situation of not cherishing the production time of model figures, having many concurrent jobs, attending many meetings, and participating in many social activities has not been changed as it should be, which is also one of the reasons why they are divorced from production and the masses.

The Prefectural Committee believes that in order to mobilize all forces to build a new socialist countryside, party committees at all levels must attach great importance to the work of cultivating and managing labor models. Therefore, the Prefectural Committee discussed and adopted a decision on cultivating and managing agricultural labor models. The decision emphatically requires party committees at all levels to strengthen the political and ideological education of labor models, constantly improve their socialist consciousness, gradually transform their conservative and backward consciousness, correct and prevent complacency, and regard this as an important link in cultivating and improving labor models. It is necessary to organize and promote their advanced experience, give them praise and encouragement, teach them working methods, and also regularly educate and help them correct their shortcomings so that they can continuously improve and achieve greater success. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely reduce the concurrent jobs and social activities of labor models, and generally not let them assume administrative positions, so that they can concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in production and leading agricultural production cooperatives. In order to do a good job in the cultivation and management of labor models, the decision stipulates a number of systems, such as the party committees at all levels managing labor models at different levels, holding labor model meetings quarterly, party committees regularly discussing and studying the work of cultivating labor models, and gradually establishing labor model archives.

In order to more powerfully promote the socialist construction cause in the countryside, the decision also requires party committees at all levels to regard the cultivation of a large number of new model figures as an important task. In addition to strengthening the regular education of labor models, counties, districts, and communes should also formulate reward methods for labor models according to specific circumstances.

    让劳动模范发挥更大作用
    临沂地区三分之一的农业模范失去光荣称号
    地委作出决定要各级党委做好培养管理工作
    新华社临沂19日电　新华社记者陈雨明报道：怎样加强对农业劳动模范的培养和发挥他们的作用，使得他们真正成为建设社会主义新农村中的骨干人物？中共山东省临沂地方委员会最近就这个问题进行了讨论，并且作出了决定。
    最近几年来，临沂地区曾先后涌现了5，295名出席县以上劳动模范会议的农、林、牧、水利等方面的先进人物。但是，在这些人中间，现在已经有1，905个失去了劳动模范的光荣称号，还有不少人虽然还保留着劳动模范的称号，但是已经不起劳动模范的作用了。同时，脱离群众和虚报成绩的现象，也在相当一部分模范人物中不同程度的存在着。
    这种情况是怎样造成的呢？地委会在讨论中认为，忽视对模范人物的培养和教育，是造成这种情况的最主要的原因。只使用、不培养，只注意模范人物的技术经验，不注意他们的政治思想状况，只表扬他们的成绩和优点、不去对他们进行政治思想教育和进行必要的批评，这是当前普遍存在着的严重缺点。因此，不少模范人物逐渐滋长了骄傲自满情绪，他们瞧不起农村基层干部和周围的农业社，不虚心学习别人的经验，和群众的距离越来越远。个别的模范人物甚至由骄傲自大发展到了腐化堕落。地委会在讨论中还指出：不珍惜模范人物的生产时间，兼职多、开会多、社会活动多的情况还没有得到应有的改变，这也是造成他们脱离生产、脱离群众的原因之一。
    地委会认为，为了调动一切力量来建设社会主义的新农村，各级党委必须十分重视培养和管理劳动模范的工作。因此，地委会讨论通过了一项关于培养管理农业劳动模范的决定。决定中着重要求各级党委把加强对劳动模范的政治思想教育，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟，逐渐改造他们的保守落后意识，纠正和防止骄傲自满情绪，作为培养提高劳动模范的重要环节，既要组织推广他们的先进经验，给予表扬与鼓励，教给他们工作方法，又要经常教育和帮助他们改正缺点，使他们不断的提高和取得更大的成就。同时，要坚决减少劳动模范的兼职和社会活动，一般的不要让他们担任行政职务，使得他们能够集中力量搞好生产和领导好农业生产合作社。为了做好劳动模范的培养管理工作，决定中规定了由各级党委分级管理劳模、按季召开劳模会议、党委定期讨论研究培养劳模的工作和逐步建立劳动模范档案等项制度。
    为了更有力的推动农村的社会主义建设事业，决定中还要求各级党委必须把培养大量新的模范人物当成一项重要工作去进行，除了对劳动模范加强经常的教育以外，各县、区、社还应根据具体情况，制定劳动模范的奖励办法。
