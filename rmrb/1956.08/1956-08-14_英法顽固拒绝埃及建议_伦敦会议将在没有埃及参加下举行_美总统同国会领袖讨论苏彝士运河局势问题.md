Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: British and French Foreign Ministry spokesmen stated on the evening of August 12th that despite Egyptian President Nasser's declaration that Egypt refuses to participate in the London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue, the conference will still be held according to the original plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.

Agence France-Presse reported that London diplomatic sources confirmed that the United Kingdom is unwilling to postpone the London conference scheduled for August 16th, and the United Kingdom has never believed that Egypt's participation is essential for the conference.

French diplomatic circles also stated that Egypt's proposal to hold another enlarged conference to discuss the Suez issue would not be accepted by the United States, Britain, and France.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower discussed the Suez Canal situation with congressional leaders on August 12th. An official statement issued by the White House after the meeting said that "the situation has been serious, and finding a constructive solution is difficult."

The meeting held at the White House specifically discussed the recently learned decision of Egypt to refuse to participate in the London conference. Despite President Nasser's solemn statement that the London conference has no right to discuss issues within the scope of Egyptian sovereignty and is not qualified to make decisions, the White House statement insisted that "since twenty-two out of the twenty-four invited countries have accepted the invitation, this conference will provide an opportunity to reach a peaceful and just solution."

    美总统同国会领袖讨论苏彝士运河局势问题
    据新华社13日讯　英国和法国外交部发言人八月十二日晚上分别表示，尽管埃及总统纳赛尔已经声明埃及拒绝参加讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议，这个会议还是要按照英法美三国原定的计划举行。
    法新社消息说，伦敦外交人士证实英国不愿意把预定在八月十六日举行的伦敦会议延期，英国从来不认为非有埃及参加会议不可。
    法国外交界人士也表示，埃及提出的另外举行讨论苏彝士问题的扩大会议的建议不会被美英法三国接受。
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔八月十二日同国会领袖们讨论了苏彝士运河局势问题。白宫在会后发表的一篇正式声明中说，“局势一直是严重的，求得建设性的解决办法是困难的”。
    在白宫举行的这次会议，特别讨论了刚刚获悉的埃及拒绝参加伦敦会议的决定。尽管埃及总统纳赛尔严正声明伦敦会议无权讨论属于埃及主权范围以内的问题并且没有资格作出决定，白宫声明仍然坚持说：“既然二十四个被邀请国中间有二十二个国家接受了邀请，这次会议将提供达成和平的、公正的解决的机会。”
