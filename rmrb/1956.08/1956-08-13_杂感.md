Random Thoughts

    The first National Music Week is being held in Beijing.

    Huang Youkui, a singer who hadn't sung for many years, sang "Southern Jiangsu Folk Song," and Man Qianzi, who also hadn't sung for many years, sang "Daoqing." Senior musician Li Jinhui composed new tunes, and the conference also specially organized a concert of excellent works since the May Fourth Movement. Young people are excited, old people are comforted, and many ballad singers shed tears of emotion at being able to participate in this performance.

    At the same time, foreign電 (I'm not sure this character is correct) news brought a message from the American music industry. The Non-American Activities Committee and the Veterans Association released a blacklist of the music industry, forcing film studios, radio stations, television stations, and record companies to fire a large number of musicians, including violinist Sidney Green and singer Eddie Ruthgarten. Facts are more powerful than propaganda, and this is one example.

    It is reported that the United States announced that it does not intend to assume obligations for the Suez Canal dispute, and Britain and France expressed "pain and surprise."

    What made Britain and France even more "painful and surprised" was the revelation of an inside story by the United Press (United Press Washington, 30th dispatch, see Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao"). It is said that the United Kingdom and international banks originally intended to agree to fund Egypt's construction of a barrage. Later, Dulles changed his mind because he received information that the Soviet Union was unwilling to fund Egypt's project, so he believed that the refusal of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to provide funding was a blow to the Soviet Union and Egypt. Of course, Dulles was confident that Egypt would succumb to this pressure.

    Let others run into walls, and then immediately express "no intention to assume obligations for the dispute" after they hit the wall.

    This is American-style "friendship." As a result, the people who tasted this kind of friendship were "painful and surprised."

    第一届全国音乐周正在北京举行。
    多年不唱了的歌唱家黄友葵唱了“苏南民歌”，同样也是多年不唱了的满谦子唱了“道情”，前辈音乐工作者黎锦晖作了新的曲子，大会还专门组织了一场“五四”以后优秀作品的音乐会。年轻人兴奋，老年人欢慰，许多说唱艺人以能够参加这次演出而流了感动的眼泪。
    正在同时，外电传来了一条美国音乐界的消息。非美活动委员会和退伍军人协会开了一张音乐界的黑名单，迫使电影厂、电台、电视、唱片厂开除了一大批音乐家，包括提琴家西尼·格林，歌唱家艾迪·鲁斯加顿在内。事实比宣传有力，这是一例。
    报载：美国宣布不拟对苏彝士运河争端担任义务，英法两国表示“苦痛和惊讶”。
    更使英法两国“苦痛和惊讶”的，是合众社揭露了一个内幕消息（合众社华盛顿三十日电，见香港“大公报”）。据说，英国和国际银行是本来打算同意资助埃及建筑水闸的，后来杜勒斯改变了主意，因为他得情报说苏联不愿意资助埃及这项计划，所以就认为英法美三国拒绝资助，是对苏联和埃及的打击。当然，杜勒斯十拿九稳，认为埃及是会在这个压力下屈服的。
    让别人去碰壁，碰了之后又立即表示“不拟对争端承担义务”。
    这是美国式的“友谊”。于是，尝到这种友谊滋味的人们“痛苦和惊讶”了。
