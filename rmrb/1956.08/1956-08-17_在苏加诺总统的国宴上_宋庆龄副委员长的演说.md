At President Sukarno's State Banquet
Vice Chairman Soong Ching-ling's Speech

Your Excellency President, and friends:

    I feel very honored and happy that President Sukarno and the Indonesian government have given me the opportunity to fulfill my long-held wish to visit your beautiful, rich, and great country. If Asia had not undergone tremendous changes in the past decade, we could not have imagined such a pleasant gathering here today. I am very pleased to be able to represent the Chinese people, who are undergoing tremendous changes, to express friendship and goodwill to the Indonesian people, who are also undergoing the same process, in this historic era. Although I have only been here for a short time, I am deeply moved by your hospitality and the warm welcome of your people, and I am deeply impressed by the prosperous scene of your country. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my warm gratitude to President Sukarno and the Indonesian government, and my highest respect to the heroic and hardworking Indonesian people.

    Eleven years ago, after a long and heroic struggle, the Indonesian people finally ended the colonial rule that had existed in your country for nearly three centuries and established your own republic—the Republic of Indonesia.

    In order to eliminate the remnants of imperialism, your country has decided to cancel all agreements reached at the Round Table Conference. In the past decade, your country has achieved great successes in all aspects. President Sukarno has succinctly pointed out that the progress Indonesia has made in eleven years far exceeds the achievements of several generations during colonial rule.

    People all over the world are happy for your achievements. Similar changes are also taking place in other parts of Asia and Africa. This powerfully illustrates how vigorous and powerful the Asian and African countries are after eliminating the harmful effects of colonialism. This powerfully proves that the era of imperialism is over, forever over, and Asia and Africa have entered a new historical era.

    The people of Asia and Africa are firmly opposed to colonialism, but they do not want to be enemies of any country or oppose their legitimate rights and interests. They believe that true friendship and lasting peace between countries can only exist when all countries, regardless of their political and social systems, respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and treat others on an equal footing. Some Asian countries, including Indonesia and China, put forward the five principles with this belief, which are known worldwide as "Panchasila"; and the decisions made at the Asian-African Conference held in your country's famous city of Bandung fully demonstrated the determination of all Asian and African countries to strive for friendly coexistence with all other countries and to maintain peace. The Chinese people are pleased to see that, due to the recent mutual visits and contacts between leaders of countries with different social systems, mutual trust between countries is constantly deepening, and the proposition of peaceful coexistence is being accepted by more and more countries. President Sukarno's visits to other countries are very important in promoting peaceful coexistence and promoting the spirit of the Bandung Conference. In the near future, President Sukarno will visit China. I firmly believe that through this visit, not only will the friendly cooperation between our two countries be greatly strengthened, but also the meeting between the leaders of the two countries will have a beneficial impact on maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    Now, the Indonesian people, like the Chinese people, are faced with the huge task of rapidly developing our national economy, first of all, developing our national industries, and eliminating the economic stagnation and backwardness caused by colonialism, so that our people can enjoy a happy life politically, economically, and culturally. We will never believe the arbitrary propaganda that Asian and African countries cannot make any economic progress if they do not exchange sovereignty for foreign aid. The Chinese people have given the best rebuttal to this arbitrary propaganda through their own experience in economic construction. I think the situation in Indonesia is the same. Only by exchanging goods and services and carrying out joint cooperation between countries on an equal and unconditional basis can we get the right way to strengthen economic relations. I firmly believe that the economic ties between China and Indonesia, developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit between the two countries, will play an increasingly important role in promoting the economic prosperity of our two countries.

    I now propose a toast to the deep friendship between the people of China and Indonesia, to the promotion of the Bandung Conference spirit, to the maintenance and consolidation of world peace, and to the health of President Sukarno and all our friends here.

    在苏加诺总统的国宴上
    宋庆龄副委员长的演说总统阁下和诸位朋友们：
    我感到非常荣幸和高兴，苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府给了我一个机会来实现我长期以来所怀抱的访问你们这个美丽的、富庶的、伟大的国家的愿望。要不是亚洲在过去十年中有了巨大的改变，我们就不能想像今天在这里会有这样愉快的聚会，我很高兴在这个具有历史意义的时代能够代表正在经历巨大的改变的中国人民向也在经历同样过程的印度尼西亚人民表示友谊和善意。虽然我到这里来不久，你们的殷勤招待和你们人民的热情欢迎使我深受感动，你们全国的繁荣的景象给了我很深的印象。请允许我利用这个机会向苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府表示我热烈的感谢，并且向英勇勤劳的印度尼西亚人民表示我最高的敬意。
    十一年以前，印度尼西亚人民在经过长期英勇的斗争以后，最后结束了在你们国家存在了将近三个世纪的殖民统治，并且建立了你们自己的共和国——印度尼西亚共和国。
    为了肃清帝国主义残余，你们的国家已经决定取消在圆桌会议上达成的一切协议。在过去的十年中，你们国家在各方面获得了伟大的成就。苏加诺总统已经扼要地指出，印度尼西亚在十一年中所取得的进展远远超过了在殖民统治期间几十代所取得的成就。
    全世界人民为你们的成就感到高兴。在亚洲和非洲的其他部分，也正在发生同样的变化。这有力地说明了亚非国家在消灭了殖民主义的有害的影响以后所表现出来的朝气是多么蓬勃有力。这有力地证明了帝国主义的时代已经过去了，永远过去了，亚洲和非洲已经进入了新的历史纪元。
    亚洲和非洲的人民坚决反对殖民主义，但是他们并不想成为任何国家的敌人，或者反对它们的合法权益。他们相信，只有在一切国家，不问其政治和社会制度如何，彼此尊重主权和领土的完整，并且在平等的基础上看待别人的情况下，国家之间才能够有真正的友谊和巩固的和平。包括印度尼西亚和中国在内的一些亚洲国家怀着这种信念，提出了五项原则，也就是全世界所知道的“潘查希拉”；并且，在贵国的著名城市万隆举行的亚非会议所作出的决定，充分表现了所有亚非国家争取同其他一切国家友好共处和维护和平的决心。中国人民高兴地看到：由于最近各种不同社会制度的国家的领袖之间的相互访问和接触，国家之间的信任正在不断加深，而和平共处的主张正在为愈来愈多的国家所接受。苏加诺总统对其他国家的访问在促进和平共处和发扬万隆会议精神方面是非常重要的。在最近的将来，苏加诺总统将要访问中国。我坚信，通过这次访问，不但我们两国的友好合作将大大加强，而且两国的领袖的会晤对维护亚洲和全世界的和平将发生有益的影响。
    现在，印度尼西亚人民同中国人民一样，面临着巨大的任务，就是迅速发展我们的国民经济，首先是发展我们的民族工业，以及消除殖民主义造成的经济上停滞落后的状况，以使我们人民能够在政治上、经济上和文化上享受幸福生活。我们决不相信这种武断的宣传，说什么亚非国家如果不用主权来换取外援就不能够在经济上取得任何进展。中国人民通过他们自己的经济建设的经验，已经给予这种武断的宣传以最好的驳斥。我认为，印度尼西亚的情况也是这样。只有交换货物和劳务，并且在平等而不附有条件的基础上进行国家之间的共同合作，才能得到加强经济关系的正确道路。我坚信，中国和印度尼西亚在两国平等和互利的基础上发展的经济联系，将在促使我们两国经济繁荣方面发挥越来越大的作用。
    我现在建议，为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民深厚的友谊，为万隆会议精神的发扬，为世界和平的维持和巩固，为苏加诺总统和在这里的我们全体朋友的健康，干杯。
