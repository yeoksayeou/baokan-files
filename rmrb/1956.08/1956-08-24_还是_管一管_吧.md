    Still Need to "Manage" It
    Shí Yè
    Someone said: "Finding housing in Hailun City, Heilongjiang, is harder than ascending to heaven." It seems this statement is not without basis.
    If you don't believe it, look at the facts! A comrade surnamed Dong from the Hailun County Cultural Center wanted to rent a few rooms. He registered at the Hailun City Housing Management Office in 1954, and it still hasn't been resolved.
    Is it that there are no houses in Hailun City? No, on the contrary, there are many empty houses, and these houses only need minor repairs. For example, in the 16th group of the 9th street, there are five very good empty brick houses, which have become "toilets" simply because they lack kangs (heated platforms). There are many similar "toilets" in other places. Some people's houses are not even as good as these "toilets," so they requested the Housing Management Office to repair these "toilets" themselves. However, the Housing Management Office turned a deaf ear.
    Having houses empty and not repaired will naturally make the housing problem more tense, but this is just tension and not enough to cause an "accident." What is incomprehensible is that some houses are still occupied but are on the verge of collapse, and the Housing Management Office does not repair them either. For example, the wall of a house in the 5th street is about to fall, and the Housing Management Office simply tied the wall with ropes. The houses of the Municipal Timber Company also suffered the same fate. Their reason for not repairing the houses is: "There is no repair value, wait until they collapse and then build new ones."
    It seems that although the housing problem in Hailun City is tense, if the Hailun City Housing Management Office can seriously "manage" instead of "ignore," the tense situation will naturally ease. Especially for those houses whose lives are maintained by ropes, if they are still "ignored," once the life of the house is destroyed, it is true that new ones can be built, but if the life of a person is also destroyed, it is no trivial matter. Therefore, the Hailun City Housing Management Office should still "manage" it!

    还是“管一管”吧
    石页
    有人说：“在黑龙江海伦城内找住房比登天还难”，看来这句话并非无的放矢。
    不信，请看事实吧！海伦县文化馆有一个姓董的同志想租几间房子，1954年就在海伦市房产管理处挂了号，一直到现在，还没有解决。
    是不是海伦城内没有房子呢？不是，相反的，还空着许多房子，这些房子只要稍加修理就行了。如九街十六组就空着五间很好的瓦房，就是因为缺少炕，大好的瓦房变成了“厕所”，其他地方还有不少类似的“厕所”。有些人的房子既然不如这里的“厕所”，就向房产管理处提出要求：自己把这些“厕所”修理修理。但是，房产管理处却置若罔闻。
    有房子空着不给修理，自然会使住房问题更加紧张，但这只是紧张而已，还不至发生“事故”。使人不可理解的是：有一些仍旧住着人而眼看又摇摇欲坠的房子，房管处也不给修理。如五街有一家房子的墙壁都快倒了，房管处只用绳子绑绑墙就算了。市木材公司的房子也遭到了同样的命运。他们不修房子的理由是：“没有修理价值，等倒了再盖新的。”
    看来，海伦市的住房问题虽然紧张，但是，如果海伦市房产管理处能够认真“管理”，而不是“不理”，紧张局势自然会和缓一些。特别是对那些靠用绳子来维系生命的房子，如果仍旧“不理”，一旦房子的生命毁了，确实可以盖新的，但是，万一人的生命也跟着毁了，那可非同儿戏。因此，海伦市房产管理处还是应该“管一管”吧！
