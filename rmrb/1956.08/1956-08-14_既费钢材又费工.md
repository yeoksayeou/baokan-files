Wasteful of Steel and Labor

The 120-horsepower and 80-horsepower crankshaft forgings needed by our factory are produced in cooperation with Factory 444. They leave too much allowance for machining during forging, which wastes a lot of steel. For example, one end of the 120-horsepower crankshaft only needs a length of four and a half inches, but the blank length from Factory 444 is more than eleven inches. The actual diameter of the shaft only needs to be four inches, but the blank diameter is more than ten inches. The weight of this crankshaft after all machining is only 185 kilograms, but the blank made by Factory 444 weighs 850 kilograms. This means that each blank must have 665 kilograms removed to become a finished product. This not only wastes steel but also wastes the labor of the workers at Factory 444 and our factory. So far, we have processed more than sixty such blanks, and one can imagine how serious the waste is. Every time we process them, we feel distressed by this waste. In order to save steel and labor for the country, we hope that Factory 444 will quickly correct this shortcoming.

    既费钢材又费工
    我们工厂需要的一百二十马力和八十马力的曲轴锻件，是由444厂协作的。他们在锻造时留的加工量太多，浪费了很多钢材。像一百二十马力曲轴，有一头实际需要长度只四寸半，444厂的毛坯长度却有十一寸多。轴的直径实际只要四寸，毛坯直径却有十寸多。这种曲轴的重量全部加工以后，只有一百八十五公斤，而444厂做的毛坯却有八百五十公斤，这就是说每根毛坯必须削除六百六十五公斤才能变成成品。这不仅浪费了钢材，也浪费了444厂和我厂职工的劳动。这样的毛坯到目前为止，我们已经加过工的就有六十多根，可以想像它的浪费是多么严重。我们每当加工的时候，一面加工就一面为这种浪费痛心。为了给国家节约钢材，节省劳力，我们希望444厂赶快改正这个缺点。
