Xinhua News Agency report:

The tens of thousands of road-building workers entering the Gobi Desert to construct the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are receiving care from the state, and their living and working conditions are improving daily. When the road construction project west of Yumen had not yet fully commenced, the leadership of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction dispatched people to conduct thorough investigations into the uninhabited Gobi Desert regarding the living supplies and working conditions of the workers. As the road construction project progresses westward, more than ten supply stores have been rapidly established at the new construction sites. The sales staff also organized mobile service teams, allowing workers to purchase necessary daily necessities without leaving their work sheds. The state also specially allocated a refrigerated car so that road-building workers living in the Gobi Desert can also taste the delicious fish and shrimp transported from the coast. Several worker bathhouses have also been established at the new construction sites in the Gobi Desert. A newly built, well-equipped construction site hospital has also begun to serve the vast number of road-building workers.

Since July, the daily working hours of road-building workers have been reduced from nine hours to eight hours. The on-site construction units have also recently rearranged the summer working hours, allowing workers sufficient time to rest indoors during the hot midday hours. Workers working in windy and sandy areas have received goggles and masks. Many construction sites have been equipped with stoves for boiling water, so workers can drink boiled water nearby when they are thirsty at work. Workers working in dispersed locations have also been issued water bottles.

Recently, the trade union organizations at the construction site have also purchased a batch of volleyballs, basketballs, and musical instruments for the road-building workers, and earthen stages have been built on the construction sites for the workers to perform plays. The workers have organized their own bands and held several weekend dance parties in the Gobi Desert. Several film projection teams have also been sent to the new construction sites, frequently traveling throughout the Gobi Desert to show movies to the vast number of road-building workers.

    关怀戈壁滩上的筑路职工
    新华社讯　进入大戈壁修筑兰新铁路的几万筑路职工得到国家的关怀，他们的生活条件和工作条件正在日益改善。当玉门以西筑路工程还没有全面动工的时候，兰新铁路的施工领导部门就派人深入荒无人烟的大戈壁滩，进行了有关职工生活供应和工作条件等方面的调查。随着筑路工程向西进展，新工地上迅速建起了十多个供应商店。售货员们还组织了流动服务组，工人们不用离开工棚就能买到需要的生活用品。国家还专门调拨了一辆冷藏车，使生活在戈壁滩上的筑路职工，也能尝到从沿海运来的鲜美鱼虾。戈壁滩新工地上还建立了几座职工浴室。新建的一所设备相当完善的工地医院，也开始为广大筑路职工服务。
    从七月份起，筑路职工每天的工作时间已经由九小时缩短到八小时。现场施工单位最近也重新安排了夏季工作时间，让工人们在闷热的中午有足够的时间在室内休息。在风砂地区工作的工人，都已经领到了风镜和口罩。许多工地已经配备了烧水用的炉子，工人们工作口渴的时候，可以就近喝到开水。分散工作的工人也都发给了水壶。
    施工现场的工会组织，近来还为筑路职工添购了一批排球、篮球和乐器，工地上搭起了职工们演戏用的土戏台。工人们组织了自己的乐队，在戈壁滩上举行了好几次周末跳舞晚会。新工地上还派来了几个电影放映队，经常流动在戈壁滩上为广大筑路职工放映电影。
