Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the First National Music Week (Excerpts)
Vice Minister of Culture Liu Zhiming

Since the founding of New China in 1949, the music industry has developed rapidly and made great achievements.

First, the content, themes, forms, and styles of musical compositions are richer and more diverse than in the past. Not only have many works been produced in large choruses, orchestral pieces, national orchestral pieces, solo singing, and solo performances, but also progress has been made in film music, opera, dance music, and the adaptation and creation of traditional opera music. Many veteran composers and young composers have contributed many excellent and gratifying new works.

There are now more than ten regular periodicals publishing musical works nationwide. Approximately 150 or more new musical works are introduced each month. The total sales volume of these periodicals is approximately 600,000 copies per issue.

Professional music performance groups have also greatly developed. The song and dance troupes, opera houses (opera troupes), orchestras, and choruses directly under the Ministry of Culture alone number fifty-seven, with approximately 4,000 music workers. In addition, there are music units under the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, cultural and art troupes of various trade union systems and central ministries, and music workers in traditional opera troupes. Under the guidance of the general policy of strengthening artistic practice and meeting the needs of the people, these professional groups have greatly strengthened their performance activities in recent years. Touring performances to rural areas, factories, and cities have increased significantly, and musical activities have begun to become regularized in some large cities.

We have also achieved certain successes in exploring classical music and collecting, compiling, and arranging ethnic and folk music. The classical music piece "Guangling San" had been lost for more than a thousand years, and scholars of past dynasties had concluded that it could "never be found again." However, through the efforts of musicians, it was finally found. The famous classical music score "Youlan Qinpu" was also considered an unorganizable and unrecognizable antique in the past, but after painstaking research by our musicians, some clues have now been sorted out. These should be considered very valuable achievements. In terms of publishing classical music, folk music, and music of various ethnic minorities, according to incomplete statistics, more than 170 kinds of various special collections have been published since 1949.

The mass music movement is also flourishing. Amateur choirs and amateur orchestras in factories, mines, schools, and rural areas have developed vigorously in recent years.

In recent years, the performances of Chinese art troupes abroad have become more and more frequent, and music programs account for a large proportion of them. Those ethnic, folk, and classical music programs with strong Chinese characteristics and Chinese style performed by touring groups have been highly praised by foreign friends. Many of our young and outstanding singers and instrumentalists have won awards in international music competitions.

In terms of music education, we already have five higher music academies and schools, as well as some art colleges and music departments of normal colleges. Higher music academies and schools have affiliated music middle schools and primary schools, as well as amateur music primary schools, which ensures a strong reserve force for our music industry.

In recent years, with the help of Soviet music experts, some advanced professional training courses have also been held, providing an opportunity for further study for some musicians who already have a certain level of accomplishment.

Although China's music industry has made great progress and achieved important results, it is still far from meeting the growing cultural demands of the broad masses of people. We must admit that the narrowness of themes, the lack of diversity in forms and styles, and the phenomenon of technical poverty in musical creation are still quite serious. There is a general feeling that the quantity of creation is large, but the quality is not high enough, and there are not enough outstanding creations that have been popular among the people for a long time. The "hundred flowers" of the music industry have not yet fully bloomed, especially in terms of inheriting and carrying forward the national music tradition, sorting out and studying national music heritage, and exploring and sorting out folk music programs, which has not been done enough. We have also not done enough to mobilize and unite all forces in the music industry, and there are still a large number of talents in the music industry whose strength has not been fully utilized.

In the past, music theory work was even weaker, and there was a lack of research on various schools of music theory, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern. In theoretical research and music criticism, there was a lack of an atmosphere of free discussion, and there were phenomena of simplification and rudeness. This has made it impossible for us to solve some major music theory problems well for a long time. This cannot but affect the further development of the music industry.

This conference will feature musical works from various periods, themes, and styles of ancient and modern China. This will be a conference where a hundred flowers bloom, and it should also be a conference where a hundred schools of thought contend. I hope that everyone will speak freely and have full and free discussions on the various programs and related issues. We welcome everyone to "contend." Only when we truly achieve "a hundred schools of thought contend" can "a hundred flowers" truly "bloom." At the same time, we also have many shortcomings, and only through debate can they be effectively overcome.

We believe that under the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," under the general goal of serving the people, and under the grand premise of further building a socialist music culture, the music industry will surely be able to do its best, give full play to its strengths, and set off a new upsurge of creative socialist music creation, so that the various flowers of musical art can bloom more brilliantly and fragrantly.

    在第一届全国音乐周开幕式上的讲话（摘要）
    文化部副部长　刘芝明
    1949年新中国建立以来，音乐事业迅速向前发展，有了很大成绩。
    首先，是音乐创作的内容、题材、形式、风格等方面，比过去丰富多样了，不但在大合唱、管弦乐曲、民族管弦乐曲、独唱、独奏方面产生很多作品，而且在电影音乐、歌剧、舞蹈音乐、戏曲音乐的改编、创作上也有了一定的进步。许多老作曲家、青年作曲家都贡献出不少优秀的、新颖可喜的作品。
    现在全国发表音乐作品的定期刊物在十种以上。每月约有一百五十首以上的新的音乐作品被介绍出来。这些刊物每期的销售数共约六十万份。
    专业的音乐演出单位，也有了很大的发展。单是文化部系统所属的歌舞团、歌剧院（歌剧团）及乐团、合唱团等便有五十七个，其中音乐工作者在四千人左右。另外，中国人民解放军总政治部所属的音乐单位、各工会系统的和中央各部的文工团、队，以及戏曲团体中的音乐工作者。这些专业团体近年来在加强艺术实践，满足人民要求的总的方针的指导下，演出活动大大加强了，到农村、工厂和各城市巡回演出的活动显著地增加了，在一些大城市音乐活动开始经常化了。
    我们在发掘古典音乐及搜集、整理民族、民间音乐方面也获得了一定的成绩。古典乐曲“广陵散”，失散了已经有一千多年，历代文人已经做了“再也找不到了”的结论。但是，经过音乐家的努力，到底还是找到了。著名的古典乐谱“幽兰琴谱”在过去也是被认为无法整理，不可辨认的古董了，可是经过我们音乐家的苦心钻研，现在已整理出一些头绪。这些应当认为是很可珍贵的成绩。在古典音乐、民间及各少数民族音乐的出版方面，据不完全统计，自1949年以来，已出版了各种专集一百七十多种。
    群众音乐运动也在蓬勃地开展。工矿、学校、农村的业余合唱团、业余乐队，近年来的发展十分旺盛。
    近几年来，我国艺术团体到国外的演出是愈来愈频繁了，其中音乐节目的演出占有很大的比重。出国演出团体所表演的那些具有强烈的中国色彩、中国气派的民族、民间和古典音乐节目，曾得到外国朋友很高的评价。我们有许多年轻的、优秀的歌唱家、演奏家，在参加国际音乐竞赛当中光荣地获奖。
    在音乐教育事业方面，已经拥有五个高等音乐院、校和一些艺术专科学校与师范学院的音乐系，在高等音乐院、校里附设有音乐中学、小学，还有业余音乐小学，这样，就使得我们音乐界的后备力量有了有力的保证。
    近几年，在苏联音乐专家的帮助下还举办了一些高级的专业训练班，使一部分已有一定修养的音乐家获得了进修的机会。
    我国的音乐事业，虽已有了很大的发展，取得了重要的成绩，但是距离广大人民日益增长的文化要求还是很远的。我们不能不承认在音乐创作上，题材的狭窄，形式与风格的不够多样以及技巧贫乏的现象，还是相当严重存在的，普遍感到创作数量很大，质量不够高，长期在人民当中盛行不衰的优秀创作还不够多。音乐界“百花”还没有完全开放出来，特别是对于民族音乐传统的继承和发扬，对于民族音乐遗产的整理和研究，对于民间音乐节目的发掘和整理，作得十分不够。我们对于动员和团结音乐界的各方面的力量，也做得不够，音乐界还有大量的人才，他们的力量没有得到充分发挥。
    音乐理论工作过去更是十分薄弱，对于中外古今各种学派的音乐理论缺乏研究。在理论研究和音乐批评工作中，缺乏自由讨论的空气，存在着简单化和粗暴的现象。这就使得我们对于一些主要的音乐理论问题，长期得不到很好的解决。这不能不影响到音乐事业的进一步的发展。
    这次大会将演出我国古代和现代的各个时期，各种题材，各种风格的音乐作品，这将是百花齐放的大会，同时也应该是百家争鸣的大会，希望大家对演出的各种节目和有关问题，畅所欲言，进行充分的、自由的讨论。我们欢迎大家“争鸣”，只有真正做到“百家争鸣”，“百花”才能真正“齐放”。同时，我们的缺点也是不少的，也只有经过争论才能有效地加以克服。
    我们相信，音乐界在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针下，在为人民服务的总目标下，在进一步建立社会主义的音乐文化的大前题下，一定可以各尽所能，各竭所长，掀起一个新的创造性的社会主义音乐创作的高潮来，使音乐艺术的各种花朵，开得更加灿烂，更加芬芳。
