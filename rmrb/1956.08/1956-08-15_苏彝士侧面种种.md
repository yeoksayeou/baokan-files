For Whom Do They Toil and Labor?

The Suez Canal has suddenly shaken the globe. The authorities in London and Paris are in a state of chaotic mourning—these well-dressed gentlemen have even resorted to uncivilized personal attacks on Egyptian President Nasser; simultaneously mobilizing warships and recalling reservists. Their news agencies are treating the climate on this waterway between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea as their peak reporting season, hoping to create fiery waves and black clouds here. Moreover, Mr. Eden, acting with great courage, has been sweating profusely these past few days. Mr. Pineau has even personally shuttled back and forth across the English Channel; even Mr. Dulles, who is busy enough with this year's domestic elections, has not shied away from the long journey, jumping off a plane in London.

May I ask: for whom do they toil and labor? Have not these eminent gentlemen always been so busy that they have no time to attend to the unemployment of millions at home? And Suez is neither on the British Isles nor in France, nor does it have any connection with the territory of the United States!

The American C. Wright Mills, in his book "The Power Elite," published a few years ago, mentioned that the people of Montana in the United States are clever people, and whenever they encounter something wrong, they "always use one sentence to explain it: 'The Company'." It turns out that the people of Montana's clever and concise phrase has long been prescient and has clearly explained to us mortals the reason for the frantic behavior of the British, French, and American authorities on the Suez issue. And since they are serving the fat and sturdy monopoly companies behind them, how can they not work diligently! In this light, it is not at all excessive for Messrs. Eden, Pineau, and Dulles to appear as if they are in mourning.

An Unskilled Chorus

Not long ago, the United States broke its promise and refused to provide assistance for the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt, which it had already agreed to. Admittedly, this was a self-comforting threat to independent-minded Egypt—that is, a fantastical threat. How long ago was it that, when Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, in the midst of the clamor for a military response from Britain and France, the United States also had its renowned Cold War veteran, Senator McCarthy, issue fiery condemnations; on the other hand, the United Press International, quite surprisingly, released a harmonizing air on the first of this month, saying that Dulles "favored finally reconsidering the issue of providing aid to the Aswan Dam." Although this news agency denied the news on the same day, the very next day, it was still the same United Press International that reported a statement by Hollister, the director of the United States International Cooperation Administration, saying that the United States' renewed proposal to help with the funds needed to build the Aswan Dam "could conceivably be found."

Truly, the weather is unpredictable, and the world is full of such fantastically unpredictable lightning-like changes!

However, this change may also be quite reasonable. Because I also had an oversight, which is that when the United Press International reported that Dulles favored reconsidering the aid issue, there was also a prerequisite, called "if Egyptian President Nasser is willing to agree to establish an international committee" to manage the Suez Canal. This means, Egypt, oh Egypt, in the past, I wouldn't help you build a dam, so you took back the canal; now I'm still helping you build it, can't you give the canal back to me? Moreover, in this way, it can avoid the murderous atmosphere, able to avoid using force, and only use—money, US dollars or pounds, etc.; isn't this more civilized and noble?

Unfortunately, although Egypt's nationalization of the canal company also announced that a portion of the canal's revenue would be used to build the dam, this is only a concrete and minor matter. The Egyptian people created the magnificent pyramids in the distant past, and today they have become one of the examples bringing beautiful dawn to the long night of Africa and the Arab region; how can such a solemn country, as those petty people think, have to take back the canal simply because you don't help me build a dam! The fundamental nature of Egypt's actions lies in recovering its inherent sovereignty and defending its dignity and independence. Sovereignty and independence cannot be destroyed by force, nor can they be bought with money. As for military threats, Egypt has mobilized with unanimous support, and all Arab countries, including Iraq, which participated in the Baghdad Pact, are firmly supporting Egypt. Even Israel has stated that it will take a neutral stance on the canal issue; Syria and other countries have indignantly raised their arms, vowing to cut off the oil pipelines of the colonialists if necessary for Egypt's just actions, and even the devout Muslim brothers are shouting to resist the conspiracy of the invaders; as for the overall support of the people of other countries for Egypt and the enthusiastic feelings of sending cheers to Suez from afar, it is simply about to make the earth boil. Look: can this be shaken by force? Regarding monetary bribery: in the past, the United States refused to provide aid precisely because Egypt insisted on independence and self-determination, but today it still vainly hopes to exchange aid for Egypt to abandon its sovereignty, isn't this still responding to all changes with constancy? -- Egypt has already demonstrated its infinitely awe-inspiring ambition, and this kind of repeated seduction with sweet talk can only slightly increase the color of vulgarity. It is really unexpected that such a powerful United States has not fully understood even this bit of common sense!

Back then, the American people also carried out a heroic and immortal struggle for independence and sovereignty. At that time, people represented by the imperishable names of Jefferson, Lincoln, and Washington not only did not think of fearing force, but also never thought that anyone's money could buy their will, causing them to give up the struggle for independence and sovereignty. If today the US authorities' plan to buy other people's sovereignty with money could become a reality, then the American independence movement would probably have ended, and even the existence of the current United States of America would be unimaginable! It seems that historical knowledge is really a useful thing! If today's American gentlemen would be willing to flip through their own history a little, then perhaps they would not have to be mediocre and shallow enough to be coy and show their banknotes after military clamor on the Egyptian issue, performing an unskilled harmony!

Such Penance

According to reports, since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, international shipping on this waterway has continued as usual, and, according to statistics, the number of ships passing through the canal in the first ten days increased from 421 in the same period last year to 455. Kyodo News also reported on the impressions of a Japanese merchant ship passing through the canal, saying that they did not find any changes there—official procedures and management work were the same as usual, and the passengers were satisfied with the visits. If one had to say there were changes, of course there were, that is, the expression of the upper-class Europeans and Americans in the canal area was unhappy, while the Egyptian people were very happy and expressed enthusiastic praise and full support for the country's measures, and all Egyptian employees on the canal donated a day's wages to build the Aswan Dam, and so on. The above news, apart from the excited mood of the Egyptian people, all other items were also reported by Reuters and United Press International.

Still the same Reuters and United Press International, etc., also simultaneously reported many other news items, saying that the freedom of navigation in the canal had been undermined by Egypt and therefore lost its guarantee—despite the fact that, in parallel with the above news, the Egyptian government had repeatedly issued statements guaranteeing freedom of navigation.

It doesn't stop there. Reuters also said that a Conservative Party lord had asked the government to build another canal from the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea through Israel to the Mediterranean, and it is said that the government believes that this idea is not unthinkable. In addition, while 125 British ships passed through the waterway as usual in the first ten days after Egypt took back the canal, foreign news agencies reported that three British ships, for the first time in the entire history of British ships since the canal was opened, did not take the Suez route, but instead detoured around the distant Cape of Good Hope. Sure enough, it was quite serious, as if the Suez Canal had become like a tiger's mouth.

What is the use of such penance! Moreover, these penance-like actions, apart from finding excuses for the ugly military threats that have been proven by facts to not scare anyone, really have no greatness at all. Just like Ah Q's spiritual victory method, it is still only used in desperate situations where there is no other way; this kind of penance by colonialists is even lower than Ah Q's, isn't it? However, even the British Empire has dressed itself up as a lamb under the tiger's mouth, which is quite meaningful.

    苏彝士侧面种种
    石潭
    为谁辛苦为谁忙？
    苏彝士运河突然间震动着全球。伦敦和巴黎当局忙乱得如丧考妣——这些衣冠楚楚的绅士，竟至不文明到对埃及总统纳赛尔滥施人身攻击；同时调动兵舰，征召预备兵；他们的通讯社更把这个地中海和红海之间的水道上的气候当作了报道的旺季，希图在这里制造出火烈的浪头和黑色的云彩。而且，艾登先生还以大勇而居东道，连日来竟不惜大汗满头；比诺先生更亲身奔波于英伦海峡的两岸；甚至正为今年国内的大选忙得够瞧的杜勒斯，也不避路途遥远，从飞机上钻进了伦敦。
    请问：为谁辛苦为谁忙？衮衮诸公不是从来就忙得连国内千百万人的失业都无暇顾及的么？而苏彝士是既不在英伦海岛和法兰西，又是与美利坚的版图毫无牵扯的呢！
    美国人赛尔提斯在他几年前出版的“豪门美国”这本书上谈过一件事，说是美国蒙大拿州的人民都是聪明人，他们随便碰到什么不对的事情，“总用一句话来说明：‘公司’”。原来蒙大拿州人民的这句聪明的简炼的话，早就是瞻前顾后，一语道破地为我辈凡人说明了英、法、美当局诸公对待苏彝士问题的手忙脚乱的缘由。而既然是为他们背后腰板既肥且硬的垄断公司服务，又哪有不效劳之理！如此说来，艾登、比诺和杜勒斯诸位先生之表现出如丧考妣，自当是毫不过分的了。
    不高明的唱和
    不久以前，美国曾经撕毁诺言，拒绝了早已同意的对埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的援助。诚然，这是对坚持独立自主的埃及的一种自我安慰式的威胁——也即是幻想式的威胁。曾几何时，当埃及宣布苏彝士运河公司国有化以后，在英国、法国大呼武力对付之余，美国也一方面让自己鼎鼎大名的冷战老将——参议员麦卡锡发出了火药熏人的叫骂；另一方面，竟又甚为新鲜地由合众社在本月一日放出了这么一个唱和的空气，说是杜勒斯“赞成最后重新研究对阿斯旺水坝提供援助的问题”。虽然这个通讯社在同一天又否认了这条消息，第二天，仍旧是同一的合众社，却又报道了美国国际合作署署长霍利斯特的谈话，说是美国重新建议帮助建筑阿斯旺水坝所需的款项，“可以想像得到也许能找得到的”。
    这真是天有不测风云，人世间同样也有如此幻然莫测的闪电般的变化！
    不过，这种变化或许也颇有道理。因为我还有个疏忽，这就是合众社报道杜勒斯赞成重新研究援助问题的时候，还有一个前提，叫作“如果埃及的纳赛尔总统愿意同意设立国际委员会”以管理苏彝士运河的话。这就是说，埃及啊埃及，过去我不帮你修水坝，你就收回运河；现在我还帮你修，你难道不可以再把运河交给我么？况且，这么一来，又能免去杀气腾腾，能够不用武力，而只用——钱，美金或英镑之类；这不更为文明而高尚么？
    稍有不幸的是，埃及之将运河公司国有化，虽也宣布了要以运河收入之一部用作修筑水坝，但这只不过是一件具体而细微的事。埃及人民曾经在遥远的过去创造了灿烂的金字塔，今日更成为了给漫漫长夜的非洲和阿拉伯地区带来美丽朝霞的榜样之一；如此庄严的国土，焉能像那些小人所想的那样，只因为你不帮我修水坝，我就要收回运河！埃及的行为之根本性质，乃在于收回固有的主权，保卫自己的尊严和独立。夫主权和独立者，既非武力所能摧毁，又岂是金钱所能买得的么？若论武力威胁，则埃及已经上下一致地动员起来，所有阿拉伯国家，包括曾参加巴格达条约的伊拉克在内，都在坚决支持埃及。连以色列在运河问题上都表示要采取中立；叙利亚等国更是愤然振臂，声言为埃及的正义行动必要时将不惜扼断殖民者的油管，甚至虔诚的穆斯林弟兄们也高呼反抗侵略者的阴谋；至于其他各国人民之全体支持埃及与向苏彝士遥寄欢呼的热烈之情，简直都要使地球沸腾而起。请看：这是武力所能撼动的么？再论金钱收买：过去美国的拒绝援助，正是因为埃及坚持独立自主，今天却又妄想以援助来换得埃及放弃主权，这不依然是以万变应不变么？——埃及早已表现了其无限凛然之志，此种花言巧语的再三勾引，不过能稍增下流的成色而已。真料不到一个赫赫的美国，竟连这点常识都未能全然领悟！
    想当年美国人民也曾为独立和主权而进行过英勇的不朽的斗争。那时候，以杰弗逊、林肯、华盛顿这些光芒不灭的名字为代表的人们，是不仅没有想到过害怕武力，并且也决没有想到过任何人的金钱能够买下他们的意志，使他们放弃为独立和主权而进行的斗争的。如果今天美国当局以金钱买下别人的主权的打算能够成为真理，那末，当年美国的独立运动恐怕也有可能完蛋，而目前的美利坚合众国之存在，甚至也会是不可想像的呢！看来历史知识还真是一个有用的东西！今日美国诸公如若肯稍微翻翻自己的历史，则在埃及问题上或许不会在武力叫嚣之余，还要平庸浅薄到忸怩作态地露出钞票，表演着并不高明的唱和的吧！
    如此苦行
    报载，自从埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有以来，这条水道的国际航运一直照常进行，并且，据统计，头十天当中通过运河的船只，从去年同时期的421艘增加到455艘。共同社还报道了一条日本商船通过运河的观感，说是并没发觉那里有什么变化——官方手续和管理工作同往常一样，船客要参观也得到了满足。如果非要说变化，当然也有，那就是运河区的高等欧美人士表情不快，而埃及人民则非常快活，并表示热烈赞扬和全力支持国家的措施，以及运河上的全体埃及职工捐献一日工资修建阿斯旺水坝等等。上述消息，除了埃及人民的兴奋情绪以外，其它各项，是连路透社和合众社也都报道了的。
    依然是同一的路透社和合众社等等，却又同时报道了许多另外的消息，说是硬说运河的航行自由遭到了埃及的破坏因而失去了保证——尽管和以上消息并行，埃及政府曾对航行自由再三发表声明加以保证。
    还不止于此。路透社还说，保守党有个上议员曾要求政府另外修筑一条从红海的阿卡巴湾通过以色列达到地中海的运河，据说政府认为此说也并非不能考虑。此外，在埃及收回运河后的头十天里面照常通过水道的455艘轮船中包括125艘英国船的同时，据外国通讯社报道，竟有三艘英国船在运河开辟以来的整个英船的历史上第一次不走苏彝士，而改道绕驶遥远的好望角。果然煞有介事，好像苏彝士运河已经变成了虎口一般。
    真是何苦来！况且，这些苦行似的动作，除了给已被事实证明决吓不倒任何人的丑恶的军事威胁找寻借口以外，其它也实在并无丝毫伟大之处。就如阿Q的精神胜利法，也还是只在别无办法的绝处才用一用；殖民主义者的此等苦行，比之阿Q，不是还要等而下之么？然而，连大英帝国竟至都装扮成虎口下的羔羊那样，倒又是颇含深长之意的。
