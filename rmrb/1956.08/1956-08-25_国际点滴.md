　　International Snippets

　　Stolen Money Must Also Be Taxed
　　In the United States, all income, without exception, is subject to income tax. In St. Louis, a thief recently stole $24,000. He was caught and imprisoned. In addition to the theft, he was also charged with tax evasion for failing to report this income to the authorities.

　　Life in Prison is Better Than Outside
　　Life in prison is better than outside – this is the experience of Carson, a 34-year-old recidivist in Texas, USA. In prison, he at least has food to eat and clothes to wear, albeit unsightly prison garb, but outside, he can’t even get that. Therefore, he recently decided to send a threatening letter to President Eisenhower. As a result, he achieved his goal and was sent back to the Houston prison in Texas.

　　Selling Eyeballs
　　People often say, “cherish something like cherishing your eyeballs,” which shows that eyeballs are the most precious thing for everyone. But in Beria, Ohio, USA, a man with four children, to pay medical expenses, painfully announced that he was willing to sell his left eyeball, which had perfect vision. This father, who did not want to be named, is only thirty-five years old and a veteran of World War II. He and his wife have already sold all their property to treat his illness, and now he has no choice but to sell his own eyeball.

    偷的钱也要纳税
    在美国，无论哪一种收入都得缴纳所得税，没有例外。在圣路易城有一个小偷，最近偷了两万四千元。他被抓起来关进了监狱。除了因为偷窃行为，还因为他没有向当局报告这笔收入，因此是意图瞒税。
    监狱的生活比外边好
    监狱的生活比外边好，这是美国得克萨斯州三十四岁的积犯卡森的体会。在监狱里，他至少可以有饭吃，也可以有得穿，尽管是不甚雅观的囚衣，可是在外边，连这一些也得不到。因此，他最近决定向艾森豪威尔总统发出一封恐吓信。结果他果真达到了目的，他被重新关进了得克萨斯州的豪斯顿监狱。
    出卖眼珠
    人们常爱说：“像爱护眼珠一样”爱护某一事物，这说明眼珠是每一个人最宝贵的东西。但是在美国俄亥俄州柏莱尔，有一个有四个孩子的人为了支付医药费，忍痛宣布愿意出售他的视力完好的左眼珠。这位不愿公布姓名的父亲才三十五岁，是第二次世界大战的退伍军人。他和他的妻子已经变卖了家中的全部财产来治疗他的病，现在他只好出卖他自己的眼珠了。
