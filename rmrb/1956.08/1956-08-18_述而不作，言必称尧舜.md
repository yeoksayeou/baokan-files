Merely Recounting, Not Creating; Invariably Praising Yao and Shun
What is the Reason?
　　In recent years, we have read hundreds of essays in newspapers and periodicals, and these essays have at least three things in common:
　　One, their theories are impeccable;
　　Two, their texts are lengthy;
　　Three, their content is largely the same; reading one more or one less makes little difference.
　　In fact, the root cause of these three commonalities is only one: the materials for the articles are mostly copied from classic works. Since the materials are mostly copied from classic works, what else can readers say? The theories are naturally impeccable. Since the materials are mostly copied from classic works, it is much easier to copy other people's words than to say one's own; once you pick up a pen and copy, you can easily produce tens of thousands of words, so it is naturally impossible to keep the length short. Since the materials are mostly copied from classic works, readers have at least read some classic works, or seen those materials in similar articles by others. Therefore, for those repetitive articles that can at most consolidate memory but not greatly inspire thought, reading one more or one less naturally feels like there is not much difference. The spiritual essence of this type of article can be said to be "merely recounting, not creating; invariably praising Yao and Shun."
　　As a tool for popularizing knowledge of classic works, this type of article may be very good; but if they are regarded as works for academic research and the expression of thought, then there is a problem.
　　However, on the other hand, why have so many of that type of article been published in recent years? Some readers probably cannot avoid sharing some responsibility. We cannot fail to admit that in recent years there has indeed been such a trend: if a person writing an article happens to say something not entirely the same as classic works, some readers will label them, saying that they violate Marxism-Leninism, and even that there are problems with their thinking. Whether those who make this kind of criticism are themselves Marxists-Leninists, and whether there are problems with their own thinking, will not be discussed for the moment, but this kind of criticism does indeed powerfully encourage the trend of daring only to copy books and not to say one's own words. On July 11th, Mr. Tang Yue published an article in the People's Daily entitled "On Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," in which there was a concluding sentence: "We should not immediately label people as idealists as soon as we hear them say something that is different from the words in the articles of Marxists." This sentence is indeed right on the mark.
　　Now that the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is being promoted, some people will certainly contend very well, and some people may not contend so well; this is bound to happen. For those who do not contend so well, as long as they are not deliberately making trouble for the people, we must not immediately label them as "contending wildly." Since the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is being promoted, we should first cultivate a climate of daring to express one's own opinions. This climate needs to be cultivated from all aspects. Not to mention academic atmosphere, even the atmosphere of eating and dressing needs to be gradually cultivated. Why is it that in the past few years, almost everyone, regardless of gender or age, wore uniforms made of gray-blue cloth of the same length, while now female cadre comrades dare to go to department stores to buy floral fabric to make new clothes, and male cadre comrades dare to take out old suits that have been piled up for many years, damaged by insects and gnawed by mice, and wear them? Although the matters are different, the principle is the same.
　　Today is the era of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and the gentlemen who "merely recount, not create; invariably praise Yao and Shun" should change their style.

    述而不作，言必称尧舜
    云何
    近年来，我们在报刊上读过了数以百计的论文，那些论文至少有三个共同点：
    一、理论无懈可击；
    二、文字篇幅长；
    三、内容大同小异；多看一篇，少看一篇，没多大出入。
    其实这三个共同点的根源只是一个：文章的材料大半是从经典著作里抄来的。材料既然大半是从经典著作里抄来的，读者还有什么话可说？理论自然是无懈可击了。材料既然大半是从经典著作里抄来的，抄别人的话比说自己的话容易得多，提笔一抄，万言立就，欲求篇幅之短，自然是不可得矣。材料既然大半是从经典著作里抄来的，读者好歹也看过点经典著作，或者从别人类似的文章里看见过那些材料，因此，对于那些至多只能巩固记忆而不大能启发思想的重复文章，多看一篇，少看一篇，自然觉得没多大出入了。这一类文章的精神实质可以说是“述而不作，言必称尧舜”。
    作为普及经典著作知识的工具，这一类文章也许是很好的；如果把它们当作研究学术、发挥思想的著作看，那就有问题。
    然而，话又说回来了。为什么这些年来那一类文章发表得那么多，一部分读者恐怕不能不分担些责任。我们无法不承认，近年来确有这么种风气：写文章的人要是偶然说一句跟经典著作不尽相同的话，一部分读者就会给他们扣帽子，说他们违背了马克思列宁主义，甚至于说他们思想上有问题。作这种批评的人自己是不是马克思列宁主义者，自己思想上是不是有问题，姑且不讨论，可是这种批评的确有力地助长了只敢抄书不敢说自己的话的风气。七月十一日，唐钺先生在人民日报发表的“谈百家争鸣”一文里有这样一句归结语：“我们不要一听别人说与马克思主义者的文章中词句不同的话，就把人家扣上唯心主义者的帽子。”这句话确是切中时弊的。
    现在既然提倡百家争鸣，有些人一定鸣得非常好，也有些人可能鸣得不那么太好，这是必然会有的情形。对于那些鸣得不太好的人，只要他们不是故意跟人民捣乱，我们千万别给他们立刻扣上“乱鸣”的帽子。既然提倡百家争鸣，我们应该首先培养敢于发表自己意见的风气。风气是要从各方面培养的。不要说学术风气，就是吃东西，穿衣服的风气也是需要逐渐培养的。为什么前几年不论男女老少，几乎大家都是一式长短的灰蓝布制服，而现在女干部同志敢于到百货公司选购花布制新衣，男干部同志敢于把积压多年、虫伤鼠咬的旧西服拿出来穿在身上呢？事情虽不同，道理是一个。
    今天是百家争鸣的时代了，“述而不作，言必称尧舜”的先生们应该换换笔调了。
