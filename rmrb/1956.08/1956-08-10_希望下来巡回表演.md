    Hoping for Touring Performances Down Below

    Editor:
    I hope that national or local representative teams of various ball sports can frequently come down to tour and perform, and provide technical guidance to sports enthusiasts, so as to promote the development of various ball sports in various places. In the past, apart from the men's and women's basketball teams, which often toured and performed in various places, very few other ball sports teams came down. Taking Shijiazhuang City as an example, apart from the Beijing Sport University table tennis team coming to perform this year in the second quarter, for the past few years, we have only been able to see men's and women's basketball teams from various places. Of course, we welcome basketball teams, but we also equally welcome volleyball, football, badminton, tennis and other representative teams to come to perform. I think sports enthusiasts and the broad masses of people in other cities will also have the same request.　Li Shisheng

### 希望下来巡回表演

    希望下来巡回表演编辑同志：
    我希望全国性的或地方性的各种球类代表队，能够经常到下边来巡回表演比赛，并对体育爱好者进行技术指导，以推动各地各种球类运动的发展。过去除了男女篮球代表队还经常到各地巡回表演以外，其他球类代表队下来的却寥寥无几。以石家庄市为例，除了今年第二季北京体育学院乒乓球代表队曾来表演以外，几年以来，我们只能见到各地的男女篮球代表队。当然，我们欢迎篮球代表队，但也同样欢迎排球、足球、羽毛球、网球等代表队前来表演比赛。我想其他各城市的体育爱好者以及广大人民一定也会有同样要求。　李适生
