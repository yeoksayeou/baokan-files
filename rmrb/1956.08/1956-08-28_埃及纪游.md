		(XI) Visiting Egyptian Factories
		In Alexandria, we visited several factories owned by Egyptian national capital. Egypt, as a whole, is still an agricultural country. It has no heavy industry of its own, only some light industries. These light industries mainly developed during the World Wars, taking advantage of the respite when imperialists were preoccupied with wars. Alexandria is the city where Egypt's light industry is relatively concentrated.
		The first factory we visited was the Bana Factory, which was not very large. Within one factory site, there were four small factories: two match factories, a compressed wood factory, and a prefabricated house factory. These four factories had a total of two to three hundred workers. The factory owner was named Bana. The facilities inside the factory were already very old, and they were even using a semi-manual match-making machine.
		This semi-manual match-making machine had been in use for over thirty years. Right after the end of the First World War, international monopoly capitalist groups prohibited the import of match-making machines into Egypt, so Bana created this machine himself. His match factory was opened in 1925; after thirty-one years, the factory has seen some development, but compared to the long period of "thirty-one years," the factory's development is obviously very slow. It is easy to understand that this slow development is due to the rule of foreign colonialists.
		Mr. Howaily, the chief engineer of the Bana Factory, accompanied us on the visit and introduced the factory's history. He has worked in this factory for twenty-four years, almost half his life, and he can be said to have witnessed the arduous journey of this slow development of Egypt's national industry. Howaily wears thick glasses and a not very elegant jacket; it is almost a habit that when the factory owner comes in, he stands respectfully and speaks to us carefully. It seems that he is an honest and loyal person.
		The second factory we visited was the Sabasi Textile Factory. The factory owner, Mr. Sbasi, had visited China a few months ago. He warmly received us. This factory was opened in 1938 and now has 70,000 spindles, more than 5,000 workers, and 1,000 looms. It can produce 45 tons of cotton yarn and 60,000 to 70,000 meters of cloth per day. Some of the factory's products are exported to Asian and Arab countries. While we were talking to Mr. Sbasi, Mr. Barden Loni, who was sitting next to him, interjected, "I remember when I was studying in London, the British said that you shouldn't have a textile industry; Lancashire should be the only textile center. So they bought high-quality Egyptian cotton at a cheap price of two pounds and then sold the finished products to Egypt at a high price of forty to fifty pounds. That's nonsense. We Egyptians should have our own textile industry."
		In the Sabasi factory, a new factory building is under construction. Sbasi pointed to this factory building and said, "Soon, I hope that this new factory building will be equipped with Chinese textile machines. I think the performance of Chinese textile machines is very good. If I had gone to China earlier, I might not have purchased European textile machines."
		In the suburbs of Alexandria, there are also several larger textile factories. For example, the Mahala Factory has 150,000 spindles, 3,000 looms, and 15,000 workers. The Misr Textile Factory and the Rayon Factory also have more than 10,000 workers in total. Alexandria has several larger enterprises belonging to the Misr Group.
		Some of the light industrial enterprises with relatively concentrated capital in Egypt mostly belong to the Misr Group. If you walk into the Misr Bank in Cairo, you will see many offices with a photograph of an Egyptian man, who is Talat, the founder and first general manager of Misr Bank. He started this bank during the great upsurge of the Egyptian national movement right after the end of the First World War. At the beginning, the bank's capital was only 80,000 Egyptian pounds, but now it has grown to 2 million Egyptian pounds, with reserves of more than 5 million Egyptian pounds. The core of this consortium has now been formed. In Egypt, the contradiction between imperialist economy and Egyptian national economy is deepening day by day. (Attached picture)

    埃及纪游

    （十一）参观埃及人的工厂
    在亚历山大，我们参观了几个埃及民族资本的工厂。就整个埃及来说，还是个农业国家。它没有自己的重工业，只有一些轻工业。这些轻工业主要是在世界大战期间，乘着帝国主义忙于战争的空隙发展起来的。亚历山大就是埃及轻工业比较集中的城市。
    我们参观的第一个工厂是巴拿工厂，规模不很大。在一个厂址内有着四个小工厂：两个火柴厂、一个压缩木厂和一个活动房屋厂。这四个厂共有工人二、三百人。厂主就叫巴拿。厂内的陈设已经很陈旧了，甚至还使用着一架半手工的制火柴机器。
    这一架半手工的制火柴机已经使用了三十多年。第一次世界大战刚结束的时候，国际垄断资本集团禁止把制火柴机器运入埃及，巴拿便自己创制了这架机器。他的火柴厂是在1925年开办的；经过了三十一年的时间，工厂有了一些发展，但是如果同这“三十一年”的漫长岁月比较起来，当然这个厂的发展是很缓慢的。很容易理解，这种缓慢的发展是由于有外国殖民者的统治。
    巴拿工厂总工程师豪威利先生陪同我们参观，并给我们介绍工厂的历史情况。他在这个工厂里工作了二十四年了，差不多度过了他的半辈子，他可以说目击了埃及民族工业的这种缓慢发展的艰苦历程的。豪威利戴着一付厚度的眼镜，披着一件不很讲究的上衣；差不多已经是习惯了，当厂主进来后，他一直恭恭敬敬地站立着，并且小心翼翼地跟我们说话。看来，他是一个老实忠厚的人。
    我们参观的第二个工厂是萨巴西纺织厂。厂主斯巴西在几个月前曾经访问过中国。他热情地接待了我们。这个工厂是1938年开办的，现在有七万纱锭，五千多个工人，一千台织布机。每天可以产棉纱四十五吨，产布六万至七万公尺。这个工厂的产品一部分外销到亚洲和阿拉伯各国。当我们正同斯巴西先生谈话时，旁边坐的巴登洛尼先生插进来说：“我记得以前在伦敦念书时，英国人说，你们不应该有纺织工业，兰开夏应该是唯一的纺织中心。于是他们以两镑的廉价收购走埃及质地优良的棉花，然后以四十到五十镑的高价将成品卖给埃及。这是胡说，我们埃及人应该有自己的纺织工业。”
    在萨巴西工厂里，一个新的厂房正在建设中。斯巴西指着这个厂房说：“不久之后，我希望这个新厂房将要安上中国的纺织机。我认为中国纺织机的性能非常好。如果我早去了中国的话，我也许不会购置欧洲的纺织机了。”
    在亚历山大郊外，还有着几个规模较大的纺织工厂。例如马哈拉工厂有十五万纱锭，织布机三千台和工人一万五千人。密斯尔纺织厂及人造丝厂也共有一万多工人。亚历山大有好几个属于密斯尔财团的较大的企业。
    埃及的一些资金较为集中的轻工业企业，大都是属于密斯尔财团的。如果你走进开罗密斯尔银行，你就能看到许多办公室里挂着一个埃及人的像片，这是密斯尔银行创始人、第一任总经理塔拉特。他是在第一次世界大战刚结束时，乘着埃及民族运动的巨大的高潮而兴办了这个银行的。开始时银行资本只有八万埃镑，而现在已发展到了二百万埃镑，准备金有五百多万埃镑。这个财团的核心现在已经形成。在埃及，帝国主义经济与埃及民族经济的矛盾正日益加深。（附图片）
