    Old Man Ding's Heart
    Old Man Ding Fuxiang is a poor member of the Wenfeng Township Agricultural Cooperative in Lezhi County, Sichuan. After he joined the cooperative last year, the cooperative saw that his family of three were all old and weak, so they assigned him an ox to raise.

    The cooperative's care moved Old Man Ding greatly. As soon as he received the ox, he took meticulous care of it. Every day, he cut more grass than others, and he watered it regularly. Before long, the ox became strong and plump.

    But one day in mid-May, Old Man Ding suddenly came down with dysentery. Even in his illness, he never forgot the ox, and he instructed his wife, "If I die, you must take good care of the ox. You and your daughter are short of labor, and you can only rely on the cooperative!"

    On May 20th, his wife saw that he was getting sicker, so she went out to buy medicine for him. His daughter, Xiuzhen, also went to the hillside to work. Old Man Ding woke up from a coma and found that neither of the two people were at home. He worried that the ox had no grass, so he got out of bed, barely supported himself to sharpen his sickle, and carried his basket on his back, staggering out to cut grass. People on the road advised him to go back and rest, but he replied, "The ox belongs to everyone in the cooperative. Even if I die, I won't let the ox go hungry."

    Old Man Ding's body was ultimately too weak. As he was cutting, he fainted on the ridge of the field. Fortunately, he was discovered by cooperative members Ding Yuxing and others, who quickly carried him back. By the time Auntie Ding returned with the medicine, he had already passed away. The cooperative members said sadly, "Old Man Ding never forgot to take care of the cooperative's ox even as he was dying. We must learn from him."

    丁老汉的心
    丁福祥老汉，是四川乐至县文蜂乡农业社的一个贫苦社员。他在去年入社后，社里看到他家三口都是老弱，就分一头牛给他喂。
    社里的照顾，使丁老汉很感动。他把牛接到手，就精心喂养起来。每天，他比别人割的青草多，水也饮的匀。没有多久，那头牛就变得体壮膘肥了。
    但到五月中的一天，丁老汉忽然拉起痢来。在病中，他还念念不忘那头牛，吩咐老婆说：我若是死了，你们一定把牛喂好。你娘俩是缺少劳力的人，只有依靠社啊！”
    五月二十日，他老婆见他病的更沉重了，就出去给他买药，女儿秀贞也上坡做活去了。丁老汉从昏迷中醒来，发现家中两个人都不在，他担心牛没有草，就从床上爬起来，勉强支撑着磨好镰刀，背起背蔸，东倒西歪的出去割草。路上有人劝他回去休息，他回答说：“牛是社里大伙的，我就是死了也不让牛受饿。”
    丁老汉的身体到底太虚弱了。他割着割着，就昏倒在田坎上。幸好被社员丁玉兴他们发现了，连忙把他抬回去。等丁大娘买药回来，他已断气了。社员们悲痛地说：“丁大爷临死都不忘爱护社里的耕牛，我们一定要向他学习。”
