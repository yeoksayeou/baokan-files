A Thousand Spindles Without a Break
Sun Yang
In the fine spinning workshop of Chongqing's 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, over half of the doffers achieved a thousand spindles without a break within a month. This is truly a miracle.

Fewer yarn breaks during doffing are more beneficial for increasing production, improving quality, and saving cotton. Not long ago, the doffers of the 610 Factory launched a competition to achieve one hundred spindles without a break, but most doffers still experienced breaks on every spindle. Even the most skilled could only manage two or three spindles without a break. One day, after attending a Party branch meeting, doffer Geng Suying kept thinking about what the general branch secretary had said: Party members should help those lagging behind catch up with the advanced in the competition and take the lead in guaranteeing one hundred spindles without a break. This principle was certainly correct, but putting it into practice was not easy. She was one of the excellent doffers in the workshop and had once calculated that on the first day of the competition, only two of her spindles had no breaks, the second day three spindles had no breaks, and the third day only one spindle had no breaks. How far away was she from the goal!

Geng Suying became even more silent. She concentrated all her energy on reducing yarn breaks. Why were there so many breaks? She discovered that the main reason was that during doffing, she used one hand to pull out a bobbin, break the yarn, and then insert a tube. When breaking the yarn and inserting the tube, the tube often failed to secure the yarn end, resulting in a break. Could this operating method be improved? This idea sparked in Geng Suying's mind. After several days of thinking, she finally quietly, and also boldly, improved the operating technique. Once, she used one hand to pull out two bobbins at once, then inserted the tubes into the spindles, securing the yarn, and then discarding the bobbins. Unexpectedly, none of the four spindles had any breaks. However, just as she was about to finish the fifth spindle, a tube was inserted, and a break occurred again.

Four, only four spindles without a break! Could she not improve further? Geng Suying was very puzzled but not discouraged. In any case, this was better than the original operation. She continued to study and found that the yarn break on the fifth spindle was because the tube did not secure the yarn. She thought: If I press it firmly with my hand after inserting the tube, wouldn't the yarn be tightened? Yes, I'll try it again like that tomorrow.

The next day, Geng Suying continued to try to improve her operating technique. She quickly pulled out two bobbins and inserted two tubes with one hand, then gently pressed the tubes with her hand before discarding the bobbins. She tried this again and again, and unknowingly, she had doffed nine spindles without a single break. This was truly a remarkable leap forward.

Filled with joy, Geng Suying immediately reported her improved operation for reducing yarn breaks to the deputy foreman.

The deputy foreman was shocked! All the doffers in the workshop were pulling one bobbin and inserting one tube, but she had come up with the unique idea of pulling two and inserting two. "No, you are violating the operating procedures!" the deputy foreman said sternly.

Violating operating procedures was a disgrace for any worker. The deputy foreman's criticism made Geng Suying feel wronged, but it was difficult to defend herself. She temporarily abandoned the experiment, waiting to report to the leadership and proceed after receiving support.

Before Geng Suying could report to the workshop leadership, someone had already reported it for her. Geng Suying received the support of the workshop leadership and began to try to improve again.

The miracle was finally created by Geng Suying: for several days in a row, she had over thirty spindles without a break. Her deeds of creating a new record immediately spread throughout the workshop. The doffers all came to watch her doff. Everyone believed that her method could not only reduce yarn breaks but also reduce labor intensity, solving a major problem in production. Soon, everyone automatically learned Geng Suying's method of doffing.

New records of fifty spindles and seventy spindles without a break continued to appear. The doffers now felt that the competition for one hundred spindles without a break was too conservative. They automatically revised their targets, wanting to move towards one thousand and two thousand spindles without a break! In May, more than 61% of the doffers in the entire workshop reached the record of over one thousand spindles without a break. All these changes took place in just over a month.

Geng Suying is constantly moving forward on the road of competition. Recently, she was awarded the honorary title of "Youth Socialist Construction Activist" by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    落纱一千台不断头
    孙阳
    重庆六一○纺织染厂细纱车间，在一个月的时间内，半数以上的落纱工人都做到落纱一千台不断头。这真是一件奇迹。
    落纱断头越少，对提高产量、提高质量和节约棉花越有利。不久以前，六一○厂的落纱工人展开了落纱一百台不断头的竞赛，但是大部分落纱工人还是台台断头，技术高明的也只有两、三台不断头。一天，落纱工人耿素英开完党支部大会回来，一路上总想着总支书记讲的话：党员们要在竞赛中帮助落后赶上先进，带头实现一百台不断头的保证。这道理当然很对，但做起来可不简单。她是车间里优秀的落纱工之一，曾经自己统计了一下：竞赛的第一天只有两台车没有断头，第二天有三台车没有断头，第三天又只有一台车没有断头。离目标还有多远呀！
    耿素英变得更加沉默。她把全副精力都集中在减少断头的问题上。断头为什么多呢？她发现主要是在落纱的时候，用一只手拔一个纱管，甩断纱条后再插上一个筒管，在甩纱条、插筒管的时候，往往筒管没有压住纱头，就产生了断头。能不能把这个操作法改进一下呢？这个想法像火花一样在耿素英的思想中闪烁着。经过几天的思考，她终于悄悄地、也是大胆地改进了操作技术。一次，她用一只手一次拔下两个纱管，然后把筒管插入锭子，压住纱条，再甩纱管。真出人意料之外，这样一来，四台纱都没有断头。可是，第五台车刚刚要落完的时候，一个筒管插下去，又断头了。
    四台，仅仅四台不断头！难道不能再提高些吗？耿素英心中十分纳闷，但并没有灰心丧气。不管怎样，这总比原来的操作好些。她继续研究，发现第五台车落纱断头，是因为筒管没有把纱条压住。她想：要是在插管以后，再用手把它按稳，纱条不就可以压紧吗？对，明天就这样再试一下。
    第二天，耿素英又继续尝试着改进操作技术。她迅速地一手拔两个纱管、插两个筒管，然后又用手把筒管轻轻按一下，才甩纱管。这样一次又一次地试着，不知不觉，她已经落了九台车都没有一根断头。这真是个了不起的跃进。
    耿素英怀着喜悦的心情，连忙把自己改进操作减少断头的情形报告给副工长。
    副工长大吃一惊！全车间的落纱工都是拔一个纱，插一个管，她却独出心裁地拔两个，插两个。“不行，你这是违反操作规程！”副工长严厉地说道。
    违反操作规程，对任何一个工人来说都是不光彩的事情。副工长的批评使耿素英感到委屈，但也很难申辩。她暂时放弃了试验，等报告领导，并得到支持以后再进行。
    耿素英还没向车间领导反映，不知是谁已经代她反映了。耿素英得到车间领导的支持，又开始尝试着改进。
    奇迹终于被耿素英创造出来了：一连几天她都有三十几台车不断头。她创造新纪录的事迹，立刻在全车间里传开了。落纱工都自动跑来看她落纱。大家认为她这个方法不仅可以减少断头，还可以减轻劳动强度，解决了生产上的一个重大的问题。很快地，大家都自动地学习耿素英的方法落纱。
    五十台、七十台不断头的新纪录不断出现。落纱工们现在对一百台不断头的竞赛已感到太保守了。她们自动地修改了自己的指标，要向一千台、二千台不断头前进！就在五月份，全车间有61％以上的落纱工达到了一千台以上不断头的纪录。而这一切变化，前后才不过一个多月的时间。
    耿素英在竞赛的道路上不断向前迈进，最近，她已获得青年团重庆市委员会授予的“青年社会主义建设积极分子”的光荣称号。
