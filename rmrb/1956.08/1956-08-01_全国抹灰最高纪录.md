Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Telegram: The Fan Shengrong Plastering Group of the Construction Engineering Department of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has consistently been advanced, set a new national record of 245.86 square meters plastered per person per day on the twenty-fifth, reaching 1,060% of the state quota. The quality of the plastering fully meets specifications.

Fan Shengrong attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers and is the creator of the advanced "layered, flow-line, staggered joint" plastering method. In 1955, his group used this method to complete two years and two months' worth of tasks in one year. In April of this year, Fan Shengrong also set a new national record of plastering 120 square meters of large walls per day. On July 9th, Wang Jingxi, a plasterer from the First Engineering Company of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, created a result 81.1% higher than Fan Shengrong's previous record by learning the Fan Shengrong group's plastering method. Following this, the Fan Shengrong group further improved operations and implemented the "small flow-line operation method", creating the new national record.

Fan Shengrong and his plastering group are praised by the masses as "forever advancing" people and groups in the Construction Engineering Department of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps.

    全国抹灰最高纪录
    新华社乌鲁木齐电　中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队建筑工程处一贯先进的樊生荣抹灰小组，企业二十五日又创造了平均每人日抹二百四十五点八六平方公尺的全国最高纪录，达到国家定额1，060％。抹灰质量完全合乎规格。
    樊生荣曾出席全国先进生产者代表会议，是“分层流水接岔”先进抹灰法的创造者。1955年，他的小组用这个方法一年内完成了两年零两个月的任务。樊生荣在今年四月间又创造了每天抹大墙一百二十平方公尺的全国新纪录。七月九日，新疆维吾尔自治区第一工程公司抹灰工人王景锡因为学习了樊生荣小组抹灰法，创造了超过樊生荣曾达到的最高纪录81.1％的成绩。接着，樊生荣小组进一步改进操作，实行了“小流水作业法”，创造了现在全国新的最高纪录。
    樊生荣和他的抹灰小组在新疆军区生产建设部队建筑工程里，被群众赞为“永远前进”的人和小组。
