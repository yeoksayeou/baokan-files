Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 26th: Japanese circles in Tokyo jointly held a garden party yesterday to entertain all members of the Chinese delegation attending the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The twelve joint organizers of this garden party included the Japan China Friendship Association, the Japan China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, and the Former Japanese Diet Members Visiting China Delegation.

Kanzō Uchiyama, President of the Japan China Cultural Exchange Association, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the organizing groups. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude and respect for the contributions made by the Chinese delegation to peace and Japan-China friendship during the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. He said that he hoped to further strengthen the friendship between the two peoples and defend peace through cultural, economic, and other exchanges.

Xu Guangping, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech at the meeting, expressing gratitude for the warm hospitality of the hosts. She said that the Chinese people are peace-loving. The Chinese people sent us to participate in the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which is proof that the Chinese people are standing together with the Japanese people to oppose war and defend peace. She hoped that the Chinese and Japanese people would unite and work hand in hand to defend world peace!

The garden party proceeded in a very friendly and cordial atmosphere.

Finally, Kikuichiro Yamaguchi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, delivered a closing speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the opinion of not wanting Japan to be neutralized is a big mistake. He said that Japan should not only be neutral, but also serve as a bridge for world peace. He also said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru are the foundation for peaceful coexistence.

At the meeting, representatives of many groups presented flowers and souvenirs to the Chinese delegation.

    日本各界举行游园会招待我国代表团
    宾主一致希望加强两国友好和保卫和平
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本各界昨天在东京联合举行游园会，招待出席第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的中国代表团全体人员。
    这个游园会的十二个联合主办团体包括日中友好协会、日中文化交流协会、日本国际贸易促进协会、日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议、前日本国会议员访华团等。
    日中文化交流协会会长片山哲代表主办团体致欢迎词，他对中国代表团在第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会期间对和平和日中友好所作的贡献表示衷心的感谢和敬意。他说，希望通过文化和经济以及各方面的交流更加加强两国人民的友好和保卫和平。
    中国代表团团长许广平在会上致词，对主人的盛情招待表示感谢。她说，中国人民是爱好和平的，中国人民派我们来参加第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，这是中国人民同日本人民在一起反对战争、保卫和平的证据。她希望中日两国人民团结一致，为保卫世界和平而携手前进！
    游园会在非常友好亲切的空气中进行。
    最后，自由民主党副干事长山口喜久一郎在会上致闭会词。他指出，不希望日本中立化的意见是大错特错的。他说，日本不但要中立化，还要为世界和平做一个桥梁。他又说，周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理提倡的和平五项原则是和平共处的基础。
    在会上很多团体的代表向中国代表团献花和赠送纪念品。
