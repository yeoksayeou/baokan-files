The Third Game Against the Romanian Team
Chinese Men's Basketball Team Instructors Chen Wenbin, Zhang Changlu

At 8 p.m. on August 26th, our athletes began their game against the Romanian men's basketball team.

The Romanian team is an internationally strong team. When we visited Romania this year, we drew with them. Before this game, we carefully observed their games against the Beijing team and the "August 1st" team. The Romanian team's characteristic is mainly calmness; the main players Fölbert, Földo, and Nedeff have comprehensive skills, and these three form a strong core; in addition, there are two tall centers, Kukos and Novak. Their tactics are also varied. In the first game against the Beijing team, the tactic was to play a small "8" pattern on the perimeter, while the center coordinated under the basket; in the second game against the "August 1st" team, they adopted a tactic of spreading out for mid-range shots in positional attacks, and using baseline crosses to deliver the ball from the corners to the center for layups. This tactic was relatively successful. The previous two games also exposed some of the Romanian team's weaknesses, such as slow transition from offense to defense and an imbalance of strength in the basic lineup.

Based on the comparison of the strengths of both sides, in order to win this final game, first, we must adopt a collective defense method. The slogan we put forward was "Pressure on the ball, block without the ball" (that is, to pressure the opponent holding the ball, not giving him a chance to shoot or pass the ball to the center, while blocking the opponent's other players' layup routes); second, adopt fast-break tactics, and achieve short passes and simultaneous starts; third, strive to win rebounds.

In the final game, the emotions of both teams were somewhat tense within the first two minutes. The Romanian team used a combination of perimeter screens, baseline crosses, and coordination through the center to give full play to each player's skills. Our team's collective defense tactic of "pressure on the ball, block without the ball" was also relatively successful; however, individual players, due to insufficient tactical training, were not good at controlling their emotions, only focusing on pressuring the player they were defending, while ignoring the collective defense, thus giving the opponent several opportunities to score under the basket. Our fast breaks played some role in the game, but because the opponent's offense was very active and our players were nervous, the fast breaks were not used completely smoothly, and the timing of their initiation was also not well grasped. A total of ninety-seven rebounds were contested in this game, and our team won more than 50%, which played an important role in the game.

In addition, our team inserted too few players in positional attacks, relying more on scoring from mid-range shots, but the shooting accuracy rate in this game was only 38% (the shooting accuracy rate of our team in general international competitions is about 45%). Now, in retrospect, if our team had done more screening and cutting, it would not only have improved the shooting accuracy rate, but also could have caused more fouls on the opponent, winning more points, because this was precisely the weakness of the opponent's insufficient bench strength.

In short, we were able to win this game mainly due to the efforts and cooperation of all the players. At the same time, we must not neglect learning from the Romanian team's advantages simply because we won this game. It should also be pointed out that the smooth progress of this game and the normal display of the skills of the players of both teams are inseparable from the serious and responsible attitudes of the referees from China and Romania in this game.

    同罗马尼亚队的第三场比赛
    中国男子篮球队指导　陈文彬  张长禄
    8月26日晚8时，我国运动员开始同罗马尼亚男子篮球队比赛。
    罗队是国际上一支实力相当强的队伍，今年我们访问罗马尼亚的时候曾经同他们打成平手。在这次比赛以前，我们仔细地观察了他们同北京队和“八一”队的比赛。罗队的特点主要是沉着；主力队员弗尔伯尔特、弗尔多和涅德夫等的技术很全面，他们三人组成强有力的核心；另外还有库科斯和诺瓦契克两个高个子中锋。他们的战术也是变化多端，第一场同北京队比赛的战术是在外围打小“8”字，同时由中锋在篮下策应；第二场同“八一”队的比赛，采用在阵地进攻中以拉开在中距离投球，和利用端线交插、从场角供球给中锋上篮的战术，这个战术运用得比较成功。前两次比赛也暴露出罗队的一些弱点，如由进攻转入防守慢；基本阵容中力量不均衡。
    根据双方力量对比，要想赢得这最后一场球赛，第一，必需采用集体防守的办法。我们提出的口号是“有球的逼，没球的封”（就是逼迫对方持球的运动员，不给他投篮机会或递球给中锋，同时封锁对方其他队员上篮的路线）；第二，采用快攻战术，并且作到短传和同时起动；第三，要尽力争夺篮板球。
    在最后一场，开始两分钟内双方队员的情绪都有些紧张。罗队运用外围掩护、端线交插和通过中锋相结合的进攻战术，充分发挥了每个队员的技术。我队“有球的逼，没球的封”的集体防守战术也比较成功；但是个别队员由于战术修养不够，还不善于控制自己的情绪，只顾逼自己防守的队员，而忽略了集体防守，因此给对方造成几次篮下得分的机会。我们的快攻在比赛中发挥了一些作用，但是因为对方进攻很活跃和我队员的情绪紧张，快攻运用得并不完全顺利，发动的时机也掌握得不好。这场比赛共争夺了九十七次篮板球，我队夺得超过了50％，这在比赛中起了重要的作用。
    另外，我队在阵地进攻中插入少，多靠在中距离投篮得分，但这场比赛的投篮命中率仅达38％（我队在一般国际比赛中的投篮命中率约在45％左右）。现在检查起来，当时我队如果多作掩护切进，不但可以提高投篮命中率，而且还有可能造成对方更多的犯规，赢得更多分数，因为这正是对方后备力量不足的弱点。
    总之我们能够赢得这场球赛，主要还是靠全体队员的努力和合作。同时我们丝毫不能因为赢了这场球就忽略了学习罗队的优点。还应该指出的是，这场比赛的顺利进行和两队队员们技术的正常发挥，是同这场球赛的中罗两国裁判员的认真负责分不开的。
