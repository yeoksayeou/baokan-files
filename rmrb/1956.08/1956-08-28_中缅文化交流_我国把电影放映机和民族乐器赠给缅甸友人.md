    中缅文化交流
    我国把电影放映机和民族乐器赠给缅甸友人
    据新华社仰光27日电　中国驻缅甸大使馆参赞程之平8月25日代表中国文化部和中缅友好协会把一架十六毫米的放映机和附件以及一套中国民族乐器（另外还有影片“天仙配”一部尚未运到）交给今年5月间曾经到中国访问的缅甸电影代表团团长吴仰拿，由他转交缅甸电影戏剧协会主席吴丁内。这些礼物是中国文化部和中缅友好协会在缅甸电影代表团访问中国的时候表示要赠给缅甸电影戏剧协会的。
    电影戏剧协会主席吴丁内在赠送仪式上说，缅中两国的文化交流有悠久的美好的历史，只是在缅甸受到帝国主义的统治以后才告中断。吴丁内相信，中国的这些乐器将有助于丰富缅甸的音乐和加强缅中两国的友谊。
    吴仰拿说，他对这次访华之行感到满意。缅甸电影代表团满怀兴趣地研究了中国电影工业。
