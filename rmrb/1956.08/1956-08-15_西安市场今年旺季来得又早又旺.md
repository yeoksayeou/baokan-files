    Xi'an Market Sees Early and Robust Peak Season This Year
    According to Xinhua News Agency, with the development of industrial construction, Xi'an City's commercial peak season arrived two months earlier this year. The total sales of state-owned commercial departments in Xi'an City in July increased by about 7% compared with June, and increased by more than 67% compared with the same period last year. The sales of joint state-private stores in the city have also increased significantly. The second quarter also saw a situation where the off-season was not weak, and the market sales volume greatly exceeded the same period in previous years.
    This year, Xi'an City's capital construction investment has increased compared with last year. In particular, the construction area has expanded and the progress has accelerated in the second half of the year, requiring a lot of construction materials and daily necessities. This is the main reason for the early arrival of the peak season. In addition, after the quality and variety of some industrial products in Xi'an City have improved, they have been welcomed by consumers from all over the country. Since the beginning of this year, more than ten regions, including Xinjiang, Qinghai, Henan, and Hebei, have purchased large quantities of enamel products and cotton textiles from Xi'an. The sales volume of many commodities produced in Xi'an has increased several times compared with the past.
    The increase in income of farmers in the suburban rural areas and the Guanzhong area compared with previous years is also one of the factors for the early arrival of the current commercial peak season. The Chenghuangmiao Cooperative Store in Xi'an City, which is famous for operating small commodities suitable for rural areas, saw its turnover in July increase by more than 30% compared with June. This store has established sales relationships with more than 100 rural supply units in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Shanxi and other provinces. In July alone, it supplied more than 20,000 yuan of small commodities to Tianshui, Gangu and other places in Gansu.
    State-owned commercial departments in Xi'an City have already arranged the market supply work for the peak season in response to these characteristics.

    西安市场今年旺季来得又早又旺
    据新华社讯　随着工业建设事业的发展，西安市今年商业旺季提前两个月到来。七月份西安市国营商业部门销售总额比六月增加7％左右，比去年同期增长67％以上。全市公私合营商店的销售额也有很大增长。第二季度也出现了淡季不淡的情况，市场销售量大大超过往年同期。
    今年西安市基本建设投资比去年增加，特别是下半年施工面积扩大、进度加速，需要的建设器材和日用物资很多，这是旺季提前到来的主要原因。此外，西安市某些工业产品质量提高和品种增加以后，受到各地消费者欢迎。今年以来，已有新疆、青海、河南、河北等十多个地区向西安采购了大批搪瓷制品和棉织品，很多西安市出产的商品的销售量比以往增加了几倍。
    郊区农村和关中地区的农民收入比往年增加，也是目前商业旺季提早到来的因素之一。以经营适销农村的小百货著称的西安市城隍庙合作商店，七月份营业额比六月份增加了30％以上。这个商店已和陕西、甘肃、四川、山西等省一百多个农村供应单位建立了销货关系，仅七月份内，供应给甘肃天水、甘谷等地的小百货就达两万多元。
    西安市各国营商业部门已经针对这些特点，安排了旺季市场供应工作。
