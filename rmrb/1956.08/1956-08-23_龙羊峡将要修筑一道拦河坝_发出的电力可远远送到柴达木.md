Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    A survey work for another large-scale comprehensive water conservancy project on the main stream of the Yellow River - the Longyang Gorge Hydro-junction Project has begun. Currently, two advance surveying teams are conducting level control measurements in the reservoir area surrounded by mountains.
    Longyang Gorge is located in Guide County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and is the uppermost cascade project in the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan. The entire gorge is more than 30 kilometers long, with banks as high as five to six hundred meters, and the riverbed has a steep slope, making it an ideal dam site for a large-scale hydroelectric power station. According to the technical and economic report of the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan, if a dam is built at Longyang Gorge, it can hold more than 20 billion cubic meters of water, and the power generation capacity is initially estimated to reach about one million kilowatts. Its cost is lower than that of Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia. The electricity generated here can be sent all the way to the Qaidam Basin.
    After this large-scale hydro-junction is formed, it can not only irrigate a large amount of farmland on both sides that has not yet been fully reclaimed, but also provide regulation when the water volume of the Liujiaxia Reservoir is insufficient.

### 龙羊峡将要修筑一道拦河坝  发出的电力可远远送到柴达木

    龙羊峡将要修筑一道拦河坝
    发出的电力可远远送到柴达木
    据新华社讯　黄河干流上的另一个大型综合水利工程——龙羊峡水力枢纽工程的勘测工作开始了。目前，两个先头测量组正在群山环抱的水库区里进行水准控制测量。
    龙羊峡在青海省海南藏族自治州贵德县境内，是黄河综合利用规划中处在黄河最上游的一个梯级工程。整个峡长三十多公里，两岸高达五、六百公尺，河床坡度又大，是理想的大型水电站的坝址。根据黄河综合利用规划技术经济报告的估计，如果在龙羊峡修筑一道拦河坝，就可以拦蓄住二百多亿公方的水量，发电能力初步估计可以达到一百万瓩左右。它的造价比三门峡和刘家峡要低。从这里发出的电力一直可以远送到柴达木盆地。
    这个大型水力枢纽形成以后，不但可以灌溉两岸尚未完全开垦的大量农田；而且当刘家峡水库的水量感到不足的时候，还可以从这里得到调剂。
