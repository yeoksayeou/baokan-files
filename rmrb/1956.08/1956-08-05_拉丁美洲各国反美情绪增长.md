Xinhua News Agency, August 4th (TASS, New York, 3rd dispatch): The American magazine "Horizon" recently published a series of articles written by its correspondents stationed in Latin American countries. These articles analyze the reasons for the increasing dissatisfaction with the United States in these countries.

    The "Horizon" magazine's correspondent in Brazil pointed out that anti-American sentiment in the country has a broad base. "The political situation in Brazil fully demonstrates this. Those centrist and right-wing parties that should have supported the US position from an ideological point of view are now also opponents of the Americans... Brazilians complain that the United States has not pursued a fair and progressive policy on the issue of Brazil's industrialization and development... The fact that American companies take almost all of the proceeds, leaving only a small portion in Brazil as investment, has caused much condemnation... Racial discrimination is also causing dissatisfaction among Brazilians towards the United States."
    The "Horizon" magazine's correspondent in Chile pointed out that dissatisfaction with the United States is widespread among workers and some intellectuals. The reporter pointed out that the worst representatives of the United States in Chile are the giant American companies in public utilities that have obtained favorable contracts and preferential tax rates. In addition, the actions of Americans in Chile and their treatment of Chilean citizens have caused resentment.
    The correspondent in Havana said: "In Cuba, for various reasons, especially because of the actions of (American) sailors in Havana and other places in Cuba, anti-American sentiment has grown in recent years."
    The reporter also pointed out that the United States' approach to Cuban sugar exports to the United States and the support of American officials for Cuban President Batista have also caused dissatisfaction among all sectors of Cuban society.
    The "Horizon" magazine's correspondents in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Panama, Uruguay, and Venezuela also pointed out that many influential groups in these countries complain about American discriminatory measures, which have caused inflation, unemployment, and persecution of politicians who advocate greater political and economic freedom in these countries.

    拉丁美洲各国反美情绪增长
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约三日讯：美国“视界”杂志最近刊载了它驻拉丁美洲各国记者写来的一系列文章。这些文章分析了这些国家对美国的不满情绪日益增长的原因。
    “视界”杂志驻巴西记者指出，这个国家的反美情绪有它的广泛基础。“巴西的政治局势可以充分证明这一点。那些从思想观点上看本来应当支持美国立场的中间政党和右翼政党，现在也是美国人的反对者……巴西人抱怨美国在巴西工业化和发展的问题上没有奉行公正的进步的政策……美国公司几乎拿走了全部进款，而留在巴西作为投资的只是其中很小的一部分，这一事实引起了许多的责难……种族歧视同样也在引起巴西人对美国的不满。”
    “视界”杂志驻智利记者指出，在工人以及某些知识分子中广泛流行着对美国的不满。记者指出，美国在智利最坏的代理人就是获得了有利的合同和优惠税率的在公用事业方面的几家巨大的美国公司。此外，美国人在智利的行动和他们对待智利公民的态度，都引起愤懑。
    驻哈瓦那记者说：“在古巴，由于各种各样的原因，特别是由于（美国）水兵们在哈瓦那和古巴其他地点的行径，反美情绪近年来已经增长。”
    记者还指出，美国对古巴糖输往美国这件事所采取的做法以及美国官员对古巴总统巴蒂斯塔的支持，也引起了古巴各阶层的不满。
    “视界”杂志驻阿根廷、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、危地马拉、墨西哥、秘鲁、巴拿马、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉的记者也指出，这些国家中许多有影响的集团都抱怨美国的歧视措施，这种歧视措施造成了这些国家的通货膨胀、失业和对那些主张有较大的政治、经济自由的政治家的迫害。
