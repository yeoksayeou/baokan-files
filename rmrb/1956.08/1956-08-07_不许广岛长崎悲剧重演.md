    Don't Let the Tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Repeat Itself
    August 6th and August 9th are dates the Japanese people can never forget. Eleven years ago, in the instant the atomic bomb dropped by the United States exploded, more than 300,000 peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lost their lives, and a large number of peaceful residents were injured. This was a rare tragedy in history. The Japanese people commemorate this tragedy with heavy hearts and indignation. Last August, people from all walks of life in Japan held the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Now, they are holding the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. People all over the world stand with the Japanese people, and they regard the conference held in Japan as an accusation and demonstration by all people of conscience against the atomic maniacs who have lost their humanity!
    Today, eleven years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki suffered atomic bombings, people cannot fail to notice that the Japanese people and the people of all countries are facing new threats from atomic and hydrogen bombs. The tears of the relatives of the victims of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki have not yet dried, and more than 100,000 injured people are still struggling on the verge of death with various injuries from the atomic bombs, yet the United States has again exploded new atomic and hydrogen bombs on the high seas of the Pacific. In March 1954, Aikichi Kuboyama, a crew member of the Japanese "Lucky Dragon No. 5," was also killed by an American hydrogen bomb explosion. The United States, completely disregarding the protests of the Japanese and Asian peoples, continues to conduct this cursed experiment on the high seas of the Pacific. At the same time, the United States is turning the entire Japan into a base for launching atomic warfare, dragging the entire Japanese nation into a deeper abyss of disaster.
    However, the Japanese people have not been overwhelmed by grief and threats. In recent years, people from all walks of life in Japan have united more closely and, together with the people of all countries in the world, stood at the forefront of the struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs. The signature campaign against atomic and hydrogen bombs, which began in August 1954, had more than 38 million participants by March of this year. The two houses of the Japanese Diet also passed resolutions in February of this year, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of testing of such weapons. Today, the song "Don't Drop Atomic Bombs Again" has resounded throughout Japan, and the Japanese people's movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs is surging even higher.
    The conference held by the Japanese people not only calls for the prohibition of atomic weapons, but also discusses the issues of military bases and disarmament. The Japanese people's struggle against atomic weapons is merging with the struggle of people all over the world to defend peace. In order to further ease international tensions, peace-loving people in all countries are now working hard for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. They also advocate that before a comprehensive agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament, countries should disarm independently, and agreements can be reached on partial issues, such as the cessation of atomic weapons testing. In June of this year, the World Peace Council wrote to the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, requesting the speedy conclusion of an agreement to cease the testing of atomic weapons.
    In terms of disarmament, the Soviet Union has set an example. Not only has it made unremitting efforts to reach an agreement on disarmament issues at various international conferences, but it has also taken the lead in announcing two rounds of troop reductions of 640,000 and 1.2 million people. Recently, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also declared that the Soviet Union supports the resolutions of the Japanese Diet on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of testing of such weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov also suggested on July 16 that the testing explosions of atomic weapons should be stopped without delay. However, these actions and suggestions of the Soviet Union have not yet received corresponding support from Western countries.
    While obstructing the reaching of a comprehensive agreement on the issue of disarmament, the United States unreasonably insists that it will continue to test atomic weapons until a comprehensive agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament. This attitude proves that the United States is still unwilling to abandon its bankrupt policy of strength. On August 2nd, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Twining openly stated that the United States must strengthen its nuclear weapons-centered forces and will use such weapons in war.
    Today, international tensions have eased, which provides favorable conditions for the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament. However, because certain groups in the United States still adhere to their bankrupt policy of strength, people all over the world must wage a stronger struggle to defend peace and eliminate the new threat of war. We, the Chinese people, are determined to join hands with the people of all countries in the world to warmly support the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs being held in Japan, and believe that this conference will be a new contribution to the world peace movement. We believe that as long as the people of all countries in the world unite and wage a resolute struggle, the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will not be repeated, the voice of peace will surely drown out the cries of war, and the power of peace will surely thwart the activities of war.

### 不许广岛长崎悲剧重演

    不许广岛长崎悲剧重演
    八月六日和八月九日，是日本人民永远不能忘记的日子。十一年前，在美国投掷的原子弹爆炸的一瞬间，广岛和长崎的三十多万和平居民丧失了生命，大批和平居民受了伤。这是历史上罕见的大悲剧。日本人民怀着沉痛和激愤的心情来纪念这个悲剧。去年八月，日本各界人民举行了禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。现在，他们正在举行禁止原子弹氢弹第二届世界大会。全世界人民都同日本人民站在一起，他们把日本所举行的大会看作是一切有良心的人们对丧失人性的原子狂人的控诉和示威！
    在广岛和长崎遭受原子弹轰炸十一年后的今天，人们不能不注意到，日本人民和各国人民正面临着原子弹和氢弹的新的威胁。广岛和长崎原子弹受害者的亲人泪痕未干，十多万受伤者现在仍带着原子弹的各种伤害在死亡线上痛苦挣扎，美国就又在太平洋的公海上爆炸新的原子弹和氢弹了。1954年3月，日本“福龙丸”船员久保山爱吉又被美国氢弹爆炸夺去了生命。美国根本不顾日本和亚洲各国人民的抗议，至今仍在太平洋的公海上进行这种可咒诅的试验。同时，美国正把整个日本变为发动原子战争的基地，把整个日本民族拖向更大的灾难深渊。
    但是，日本人民并没有被悲痛和威胁所压倒。近些年来，日本各界人民日益紧密地团结起来，同世界各国人民一道，站在反对原子弹氢弹斗争的前列。1954年8月开始的禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动，到今年三月止，已有三千八百多万人参加。日本国会两院今年二月也通过决议，要求禁止原子武器并停止试验这种武器。今天，“不准再投原子弹”的歌声已经响彻日本全国，日本人民反对原子弹和氢弹的运动更加高涨了。
    日本人民所举行的这次大会，不只呼吁禁止原子武器，同时还要讨论军事基地和裁减军备问题。日本人民反对原子武器的斗争，正同世界各国人民保卫和平的斗争汇合在一起了。为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，现在各国爱好和平人民也正为裁减军备和禁止原子武器而努力。他们并且主张，在裁军问题未达成全面协议以前，各国应该单独裁军，并且可以就局部问题达成协议，例如停止试验原子武器等。今年六月，世界和平理事会就曾致书美苏英三国政府，要求迅速缔结停止试验原子武器协定。
    在裁军方面，苏联已作出了榜样。它不仅在历次国际会议上为裁军问题达成协议作了不断的努力，而且率先前后两次宣布裁军六十四万人和一百二十万人。最近，苏联最高苏维埃并声明，苏联支持日本国会关于禁止原子武器和停止试验这种武器的决议。苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫七月十六日又建议原子武器的试验爆炸应该毫不拖延地停止进行。但是，苏联的这些行动和建议至今仍未得到西方国家的相应的支持。
    美国一边阻挠在裁军问题上达成全面协议，一边又无理地坚持说，在没有就裁军问题达成全面协议以前，它还要继续试验原子武器。这种态度证明美国仍不肯放弃原子战争的准备。八月二日，美国空军参谋长特文宁就公开说，美国要加强以核子武器为中心的力量，并且将在战争中使用这种武器。
    今天，国际紧张局势已经有了缓和，这给禁止原子武器和裁军提供了有利的条件。但是由于美国某些集团仍然坚持它的已经破产了的实力政策，全世界人民为了保卫和平，为了消除新的战争威胁，还必须进行更坚强的斗争。我们中国人民决心同世界各国人民一道，热烈支持正在日本举行的第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，并认为这次大会将是对世界和平运动的一个新的贡献。我们相信，只要世界各国人民团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，广岛和长崎的悲剧就不会重演，和平的声音就一定会湮没战争的叫嚣，和平的力量就一定会挫败战争的活动。
