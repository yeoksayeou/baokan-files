    Border Soldiers Love the Border
    Zhao Qi
    I recently visited a unit stationed in the Himalayan region. In the Yadong Valley on the southern slope of the Himalayas, it is now the time for Tibetan farmers to harvest highland barley. The soldiers planted red flags in the fields on the mountainside, helping the masses with the busy harvest and transport. The Tibetan men and women of the mountain village labored while singing mountain songs as if celebrating a festival, some bringing sweet milk tea to comfort the soldiers who were working with them in the fields.
    A year ago, this heroic unit, which had built the Kangzang Highway, walked across the Himalayan region and arrived in the Yadong Valley. As soon as the officers and soldiers put down their backpacks, they helped the residents rush to harvest highland barley. They regarded guarding the Himalayan region as their glory. In March of this year, they and Tibetan laborers together finally built the highway from central Tibet to the Himalayan region. For most of the past six years, this unit has been building roads in deep mountain canyons. Now, for the first time, they live in Tibetan villages, using their hands, hardened by steel drills, to plow and harvest for the Tibetan farmers, and using their shoulders and backs to carry water and firewood for their landlords. They lent the picks and shovels they used to build roads in the past to the residents as production tools, and used their military horses to transport grain for the villagers.
    Many poor Tibetan farm families had almost everything taken care of by the soldiers, from plowing and sowing to harvesting, from water to firewood. Langqiong Zhuoma, a sixty-one-year-old woman from Chunshi Village, has no children and cultivated several plots of hillside land. After a squad from the unit moved into her house, she no longer had to work in the fields. She called all the soldiers "dear children," and the soldiers called her "Mama." Whenever the soldiers returned from class or production, they could drink the boiled water she had already prepared. Sometimes when the unit watched movies, she would wait until late at night. Once, when soldier Zhao Wenxue was ill, the old woman was so sad that she couldn't sleep, and sat by the bed burning juniper incense (a Tibetan custom for praying for good luck), and got up at night to make sweet tea for the patient.
    The medical staff of the unit treated the local residents day and night. A child named Basang in Galinggang Village was critically ill. After eight days and eight nights of treatment and care, the child's life was finally saved.
    The glorious border soldiers all love the border of the motherland. Wu Xueshuang, the deputy squad leader who had made contributions to the construction of the Kangzang Highway, told reporters: "I love the border of the motherland, and I love the hardworking Tibetan people here. When the Tibetan people live a happy life, we are happy in our hearts!"

    边疆战士爱边疆
    赵奇
    我最近访问了驻在喜马拉雅山区的一支部队。在山南麓的亚东河谷，现在正是藏族农民收割青稞的日子。士兵们把红旗插在山腰田里，帮助群众忙割忙运。山村的藏族男女像过节日一样地唱着山歌劳动，有的带着甜奶茶，慰问在田间和他们一起劳动的士兵。
    一年前，这支曾经修筑过康藏公路的英雄部队，徒步走过喜马拉雅山区，来到了亚东河谷。官兵们一放下背包，便帮助居民赶收青稞。他们把驻守喜马拉雅山区当作自己的光荣。今年三月，他们和藏族民工一起，把公路从西藏中部最后修到了喜马拉雅山区。这支部队的过去六年，大部分时间是在深山峡谷中修路。现在，他们第一次住到藏族的乡村里，用他们被钢钎磨出硬茧的手给藏族农民翻地和收割，用肩和背给房东背水、运柴。他们把过去修路用的铁镐洋锹，借给居民当生产工具，用自己的军马为村里的居民运粮食。
    许多贫苦的藏族农家，从翻地下种到收割，从用水到烧柴，几乎全被士兵们包下了。春石村六十一岁的朗琼卓玛，没有儿女，种了几块山坡地。部队一个班住到她家以后，田里的活再也不用她劳累了。她把士兵们一律喊作“亲孩子”，士兵们也都称呼她为“妈妈”。每当士兵们上课或生产回来的时候，都能喝到她早已准备好的开水。有时部队看电影，她就一直守候到深夜。有一次，士兵赵文学病了，老妈妈难过得睡不着觉，坐在床边烧柏枝香烟（藏族人民祈祷吉祥的习俗），夜里起来为病人烧甜茶。
    部队的医务工作人员，不分日夜地为当地居民治病。噶林岗村一个名叫巴桑的孩子病得危急万分，经过他们八天八夜的治疗和护理，这个孩子的生命终于得到了挽救。
    光荣的边疆战士们都热爱祖国的边疆。曾经在康藏公路修建工程中立过功的副班长吴学双就对记者说：“我爱祖国的边疆，我爱这里勤劳的藏族人民。藏族人民过着幸福生活，我们的心里也就高兴了！”
