    Orphan Becomes University Student
    Wang Wenhu, an orphan who was in the Hangzhou People's Nursery six years ago, was admitted to the East China Aeronautical Institute this summer.
    Wang Wenhu is a graduating high school student from Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School in Zhejiang Province and is eighteen years old this year. His parents died one after the other when he was still a child. Wang Wenhu had no uncles or brothers, and no siblings. Although he had a maternal aunt, she was too poor to support him. He only had an elderly grandmother who made a living by sewing and mending clothes to raise him.
    In 1948, Wang Wenhu was ten years old. The old grandmother had no way to support him any longer, so she tearfully sent her only beloved grandson to the orphanage—the pseudo-Zhejiang First Nursery. After liberation, this nursery and the nursery of the pseudo-Zhejiang Relief Institute were merged into the Hangzhou People's Nursery (now renamed the Hangzhou Children's Education Center). In February 1951, Wang Wenhu, who was studying at the People's Nursery, was admitted to Hangzhou Junior Middle School of Zhejiang Province (now renamed Hangzhou No. 4 Middle School of Zhejiang Province) because of his excellent academic performance and equivalent academic qualifications. After graduating from junior high school in 1953, he was admitted to the senior high school department of Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School.
    Wang Wenhu has a particularly strong memory and comprehension. In school, his total score was always above 80 points each semester. In this summer's graduation exam, he got a score of five in eight subjects out of eleven, and the remaining three subjects were also four. Therefore, when applying for university this time, the school approved him to apply for the national defense industry school that the country needs most.
    Wang Wenhu is relatively thin and small because of malnutrition since childhood. Because he usually insists on physical exercise, he can reach the health level required by a national defense school.

    孤儿成了大学生
    六年前还在杭州市人民保育院的孤儿王文虎，今年暑假考取了华东航空学院。
    王文虎是浙江省杭州第一中学的应届高中毕业生，今年十八岁。他还在童年的时候，父母就相继病故。王文虎没有叔叔和伯伯，也没有兄弟姊妹，虽然有一个姨母，但因为家穷，也没有办法养活他，只有一个年老的祖母，靠给人缝缝补补，挣几个钱抚养他。
    1948年，王文虎十岁了，老祖母没有办法再养活他，就忍痛把她唯一的爱孙送进了孤儿院——伪浙江省第一育幼院。这个育幼院，解放后和伪浙江省救济院育幼所合并为杭州市人民保育院（现在改为杭州市儿童教养院）。1951年2月，在人民保育院学习的王文虎，因为学业成绩优良，以同等学力考取了浙江省杭州初级中学（现改名为浙江省杭州第四中学），1953年初中毕业后，考取了杭州第一中学高中部。
    王文虎的记忆力和理解力特别强，在学校里每学期总成绩在八十分以上。今年暑假毕业考试时，十一门功课中有八门得了五分，其余三门也都是四分。因此，在这次投考大学时，学校批准他报考国家最需要的国防工业学校。
    王文虎由于从小营养不良，身体比较瘦小。因为他平时坚持体育锻炼，所以能够达到一个国防学校所要求的健康水平。
