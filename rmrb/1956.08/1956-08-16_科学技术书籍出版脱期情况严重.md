Reader's Letter:

    Serious Delays in Publication of Scientific and Technological Books

    To the Editor:

　　The failure of publishers of scientific and technical books to publish on schedule is a very serious problem. For example, the Geological Publishing House's "Surveying" and "Research Method of Crystal Optical Thin Sections" were intended as teaching materials for professional schools in the spring semester and should have been published in January. However, the former is now scheduled for publication on August 25, and the latter was cancelled due to excessive delays. The Light Industry Publishing House planned to publish eleven titles in March, but only four were actually published. The Ministry of Light Industry notified various regions as early as January of this year to purchase the "Introduction to the Preparation Experience of Chinese Patent Medicine" published by the company at Xinhua bookstores, but the books were not complete until mid-July. The People's Posts and Telecommunications Publishing House planned to publish 28 titles in May, but only six were actually published. The National Defense Industry Publishing House planned to publish ten titles in April, but only two were actually published. The Building Installation Engineering Publishing House planned to publish fifteen titles in March, but only two were actually published. The State Construction Commission requested the central ministries to notify their subordinate units that the fourteen volumes of the publishing house's "Provisional Technical Specifications for Construction and Installation Engineering Construction Acceptance" could be published in the first quarter and that enterprises should accept projects based on these books. However, the book only began to be published in May, and there is still one volume that has not been published. The acceptance personnel in Harbin units commented: By the time you ship the books, our acceptance work will have already ended. The Power Industry Publishing House, the Textile Industry Publishing House, the People's Medical Publishing House, and the Renmin University of China Press also have serious problems in not publishing according to plan.
　　Some professional publishers keep postponing the publication dates of their books. For example, the Science Press's "Isotope Chemistry" was originally announced to be published in December 1955, then changed to January of this year, then to March, and then to April, but it has not yet been published. The People's Medical Publishing House's "Practical Medical Entomology" was originally scheduled to be published in March, then changed to April, then to May, and then to the end of June, but it was not actually published until late July. The China Forestry Publishing House expected to publish "Financial Organization of Timber Harvesting and Transportation Enterprises" in September of last year, but it was delayed until March of this year, saying it would be published in June, but now it is announced that it will be published in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only are the above books in this situation, but most books are in this situation.
　　Due to the failure of various publishing houses to publish according to plan, the supply work of bookstores has been affected, and it has also caused many difficulties for readers in marching towards science. For example, the publication period of the "Quick Picture Reading for Mechanical Workers" published by the Science Popularization Association was delayed by four months. The Nanjing Technical School had to repeatedly change its teaching plan to wait for the book to be published, and finally the Nanjing Xinhua Bookstore had to engrave more than 30 wax papers on behalf of the school and print more than 30,000 handouts. The Higher Education Press's "Basic Theory of Electrical Engineering" (I), "Theoretical Mechanics Tutorial," and "Quantitative Analysis" and other books could not be published in time, so the Hubei Provincial Industrial Technology School in Hankou and other units had to send people directly to Beijing to ask for the books. A factory in Northeast China could not buy these books in various cities in Northeast China, so it also sent people to Beijing to ask for the books.
　　Currently, our Second Distribution Department receives an average of about 60 letters a day inquiring about the status of book distribution and publication. We have to spend a lot of manpower to handle these letters, which causes many difficulties in our work. We urgently request relevant publishing houses to seriously examine their publishing plans and quickly change the abnormal situation of publishing. We are willing to work together with various publishing houses to meet the urgent demands of relevant units and the vast number of readers to march towards science.

### 科学技术书籍出版脱期情况严重

专栏：读者来信

    科学技术书籍出版脱期情况严重编辑同志：
　　科学技术专业书籍的出版社不能按计划出书的情况非常严重。如地质出版社的“测量学”、“晶体光学薄片研究法”是供应春季专业学校的教材，应该在一月份出版，可是，到现在前者计划八月二十五日出版，后者因拖延过久订货作废了。轻工业出版社三月份计划出书十一种，实际只出了四种。该社出版的“中药成药配制经验介绍”，轻工业部早在今年一月就通知各地向新华书店购买，而书到七月中旬才出齐。人民邮电出版社五月份计划出书二十八种，实际出版六种。国防工业出版社四月份计划出书十种，实际出版二种，建筑安装工程出版社三月份计划出书十五种，实际出版了二种。该社的“建筑安装工程施工验收暂行技术规范”共十四册，国家建设委员会曾要中央各部通知所属各单位，这部书可在第一季度出版，要各企业单位根据这部书验收工程，但这部书到五月才开始出版，到现在还有一册未出。哈尔滨各单位的验收人员提意见说：等你们把书运来了，我们的验收工作早就结束了。其它如电力工业出版社、纺织工业出版社、人民卫生出版社、中国人民大学出版社不能按计划出书的情况也很严重。　
　有些专业出版社出书日期一拖再拖。如科学出版社的“同位素化学”一书，预告1955年12月出版，后改今年一月，一月改三月，三月又改四月，可是到现在还没有出。人民卫生出版社的“实用医学昆虫学”原预告三月出版，后改四月，再改五月，又改六月底，实际到七月下旬才出书。中国林业出版社预计在去年九月出版“木材采运企业财务组织”一书，拖到今年三月，说在六月出书，现在又通知说在今年第四季度才出书。不仅仅以上几本书如此，多数的书都是这样的情况。　　由于各出版社不按计划出书，结果影响了书店的供应工作，同时也给读者向科学进军造成了不少困难。如科学普及协会出版的“机械工人速成看图”出版期延迟了四个月，南京市技工学校不得不一再改变教学计划，等书出版，最后只好由南京新华书店代学校刻写了三十多张蜡纸并印了三万多张讲义。高等教育出版社“电工学理论基础”（一）、“理论力学教程”、“定量分析”等书，由于不能及时出版，汉口湖北省工业技术学校等着用书，不得不直接派人到北京要书，东北某工厂在东北各城市都未买到这几本书，也派人到北京来要书。　　目前我所第二发行部平均每天要收到查询发书情况和出版情况的信件约六十件，我们要花很多的人力来处理这些信件，工作上发生很多困难。我们迫切要求有关出版社认真检查出书计划，迅速改变出书不正常的情况。我们愿意同各出版社共同为满足有关单位、广大读者向科学进军的迫切要求而努力。
