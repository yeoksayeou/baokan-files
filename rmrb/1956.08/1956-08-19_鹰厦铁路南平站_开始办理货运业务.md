Xinhua News Agency, Nanping, 16th. The Nanping Station of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway began handling freight services on the 15th.

　　At 6:00 a.m. on the 15th, the first train departing from Nanping Station, carrying more than 530 tons of timber and salt, rumbled towards Yingtan through green hills and valleys. As the train passed, lumberjacks and farmers in mountain villages along the line stood on tiptoe, craned their necks, and waved in cheers.

　　The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway stretches 312 kilometers from Yingtan to Waiyang, and then from Waiyang to Nanping, the terminus of the Wai (yang)-Nan (ping) branch line. In order to start freight operations ahead of schedule, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and civilian road builders worked day and night on maintenance projects along this section of the line. The 23-kilometer Wai-Nan branch line, from the start of track laying to the beginning of operations, took only thirty-four days. This line is now linked to the Minjiang River waterway. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments in various locations downstream of the Minjiang River are signing materials transportation contracts with Nanping Station.

    鹰厦铁路南平站
    开始办理货运业务
    新华社南平16日电　鹰厦路南平车站十五日起办理货运业务。
    十五日上午六时，由南平车站开出的第一列车，载着五百三十多吨木材和食盐，穿过青山翠谷，向鹰潭隆隆开去。当列车经过时，沿线山村的伐木工人和农民颠足翘首，挥手欢呼。
    鹰厦铁路从鹰潭到外洋，再由外洋到外（洋）南（平）支线终点的南平，共长三百十二公里。中国人民解放军铁道兵和筑路民工为了提前举办货运业务，曾经在这段线路上日夜进行维修工程，其中外南支线的二十三公里线路从开始铺轨到开始营业，前后只用了三十四天时间。现在，这段线路已和闽江航道联结起来了。闽江下游各地国营商业和供销合作部门正在与南平车站签订物资运输合同。
