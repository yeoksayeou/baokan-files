Before and After Our Research on Polyploidy
　　Bao Wenkui

　　To talk about polyploidy in plants, we must first talk about chromosomes. Chromosomes are one of the main components of the cell nucleus, and their number is generally fixed in a plant species. For example, common cultivated wheat has forty-two, and rice has twenty-four. In the early 20th century, botanists discovered that plant species with close kinship in taxonomy often have a certain multiple relationship in their chromosome numbers. For example, many species in the wheat genus have a minimum chromosome number of fourteen, followed by twenty-eight, and a maximum of forty-two. They are all multiples of seven. Therefore, the wheat species with fourteen chromosomes is called diploid (meaning twice seven), the species with twenty-eight chromosomes is called tetraploid, and the species with forty-two chromosomes is called hexaploid. Tetraploid and hexaploid are collectively referred to as polyploids.

　　What is the meaning of the multiple relationship of chromosome numbers? The theory now agreed upon by most scholars is that diploid species are primitive species, and polyploid species are derived species. That is to say, polyploid species are synthesized from diploid primitive species. Hybridization experiments combined with chromosome group analysis have confirmed this theory. However, this does not mean that all the diploid ancestral species that make up the polyploid can be found. Because some may not have been discovered yet, and some may have been eliminated by nature. For example, to this day, only one diploid ancestral species has been found in the wheat genus, and two more are waiting for us to discover. In the Brassica genus, three diploid ancestral species with different numbers have been found, namely: common rapeseed with twenty chromosomes, kale with eighteen chromosomes, and black rapeseed with sixteen chromosomes. Many polyploid species of the Brassica genus have been proven to be related to these three ancestral species.

　　Polyploids account for a relatively high percentage in the plant kingdom, which has been proven by many statistical materials. We have statistically analyzed 1,711 species of seed plants, of which 38.17% are polyploids. In Gramineae plants, the percentage of polyploids is even higher. We have statistically analyzed 107 species, of which 71.96% are polyploids. Therefore, it is obvious that polyploidy occupies an important position in the formation of plant species. The discovery of this natural law is not only of theoretical significance, but also opens up avenues for artificial creation of new plants in practice. According to this natural law, it is possible for us to create many new plant species that have never existed on Earth. The first to achieve results in this area was the Soviet botanist Karpechenko, who synthesized a new polyploid species of radish and kale thirty years ago. He named the newly synthesized species radish-brassica.

　　The chromosome number of the first generation of general distant hybrids is only half the sum of the chromosome numbers of the two parents, and they are often infertile. This is because the number of chromosomes in eggs and sperm is only half (haploid), so the resulting combination is only a diploid hybrid. Therefore, one of the first problems to be solved in the artificial creation of new polyploid species is: how can the number of chromosomes be doubled? Therefore, during this period, many scientists conducted extensive research on the problem of chromosome doubling. This important task was not fundamentally solved until the discovery of the effect of colchicine in 1937. Colchicine is a plant alkaloid extracted from a plant called colchicum that grows along the Mediterranean coast. Treating hybrid seeds or seedlings with colchicine can turn the original infertile diploid into a fertile tetraploid synthetic species. Therefore, after 1937, many artificially induced polyploids were created. The importance of this in selection work can be fully illustrated by the work of Academician Tsitsin, who said: "Using the phenomenon of polyploidy, in 1947 I was finally able to formulate a method to completely overcome the infertility of the first generation of rye-elymus hybrids. Overcoming the infertility of rye-elymus hybrids is a great victory for Soviet selection."

　　Polyploids obtained by doubling the chromosome number of the first generation of distant hybrids are called allopolyploids, because their chromosomes come from different parental species. We can also double the chromosomes of species that have not been hybridized. The polyploids thus obtained are called autopolyploids, because their chromosomes come from the same species. Allopolyploids are synthetic new species that are easily understood to have new properties. Although autopolyploids are simply a doubling of the chromosome number, they often show new characteristics compared to the original diploids. The most common are that the plants become larger, the flowers and fruits or seeds become larger, as well as changes in other physiological characteristics. These changes are often of economic value to humans. Therefore, Baranov concluded in a paper "Polyploid Plants Serving Soviet Agriculture": "Polyploidy is an objective law of nature mastered by science, and it must be made to serve Soviet agriculture."

　　In the winter of 1950, I returned to my motherland from the United States, and in early 1951, I began polyploid induction and selection work. We used colchicine to treat seedlings, and in two years, we obtained four varieties of barley autopolyploids, wheat-rye distant hybrid allopolyploids, and three varieties of rice autopolyploids. In 1953, we obtained several types of wheat-rye hybrids. However, unfortunately, because colchicine treatment was considered by some to be reactionary and Morganist, it was no longer used for treatment. As a result, these un-doubled chromosome hybrids failed to obtain offspring due to infertility.

　　Whether it is autopolyploid or allopolyploid, although they can all set seeds, the seed setting rate often fails to reach the normal level, and the seeds are often shriveled and unfilled. This is the main difficulty encountered in applying the law of polyploidy to cereal crops. This difficulty was fully estimated before our work began. Based on the effect of colchicine on dividing cells, I initially believed that artificially induced polyploids have a high degree of homogeneity, so their seed setting rate is not high, and the seeds are not full enough, which is similar to the degradation phenomenon produced by multiple forced self-pollination. If this reasoning is correct, then as long as we find a way to make artificially induced polyploids heterozygous, the problem of their seed setting rate and seed plumpness will be solved. The method of heterogenization can use strong stimulating factors, such as ultraviolet light, X-rays, and high-energy particles generated by radioactive elements, to cause genetic variation in the organism from the inside; or it can use the method of hybridization between polyploid varieties to make it heterozygous. The original plan was to use both methods at the same time, so when I returned to China, in addition to bringing a few grams of colchicine, I also brought ultraviolet light tubes and X-ray tubes. Unfortunately, these three things were opposed by some people in the institute, so they were all stopped in 1953. Ultraviolet light and X-rays were only tried on autotetraploid rye for a short time, and their effects could not be confirmed because the time was too short. I think this work is also worth considering in the near future when radioactive elements, the products of atomic energy, can be used conditionally.

　　As for the hybridization work between polyploid varieties, obvious results began to be obtained in the summer harvest of 1954. At that time, the hybrid between barley autotetraploid varieties had reached the second generation. The seed setting rate of many plants was already close to normal, and the seed plumpness had also increased significantly. The thousand-grain weight of many plants had more than doubled compared to the diploid original species. The hybrid of wheat-rye allopolyploid and common wheat had also reached the second generation, and the same promising plants with normal seed setting rate, full seeds, and vigorous growth also appeared. Rice autotetraploid indica-japonica hybridization was only successfully obtained in the greenhouse in early spring of 1954. The performance of the first generation hybrid that year was unexpectedly good. Everyone knows that the fertility of the first generation of diploid indica-japonica hybrids is extremely low, and generally less than 6% of the spikelets can set seeds. However, the first generation of tetraploid indica-japonica hybrids we obtained generally reached a seed setting rate of about 50%, and the thousand-grain weight of the seeds also exceeded that of the diploid by 60%. This result is worthy of attention in rice breeding work.

　　In 1954, when we had just obtained preliminary results and were preparing the land to sow polyploid materials of wheat crops, the institute suddenly notified us to stop polyploid research work. We disagreed with this measure taken by the leaders. On the one hand, I asked the leading comrades to take a look at our existing materials, and at the same time pointed out that such a decision was against the spirit of the Constitution that had just been promulgated not long ago. On the other hand, I also requested that if the institute did not allow us to plant, please allocate a small piece of land to us, and all expenses would be borne by myself. We could take time out of work to carry out research work in order to preserve these seeds. But these requests were not granted. As a result, the ones that had not been sown were stopped from sowing, and the tetraploid barley that had already been sown and emerged were also removed by the comrades of the secretary's office leading the agricultural workers. The wheat-rye allopolyploids that were sown in pots in stages were also ordered by the leading comrades to be pulled out by the comrades who were conducting the experiment. At that time, our grief was indescribable. We felt sorry for these many valuable materials, and we experienced the harm caused by dogmatism and authoritarianism. But we also firmly believe that this is not the policy of the Party and the government towards scientific work. Our Party is a Party of seeking truth from facts established on the basis of the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism. We have no doubt that work that is beneficial to the people will eventually receive the support of the Party and the government.

　　Soon after, the leaders of the Agricultural Science Research Institute asked me to make a review on the issue of colchicine at the provincial technical conference in Sichuan Province. At the meeting, the comrades routinely raised many sharp criticisms and accusations, and my review failed to pass. After the meeting, I asked the leading comrades of the Agricultural Science Research Institute to allow me to express my own opinions on the issue of polyploidy at the meeting, and they agreed. At the meeting the next day, I described the significance of polyploidy work and the current situation of the polyploid materials we have obtained, and presented the paper published by Corresponding Academician Baranov in the second issue of the Soviet Journal of Botany in 1954: "Polyploid Plants Serving Soviet Agriculture." After a day of discussion, the chairman of the meeting finally announced three conclusions:

　　1. It is believed that applying colchicine to treat polyploids is divorced from reality and divorced from politics.

　　2. Using colchicine to treat polyploids is in conflict with Michurin's theory.

　　(Based on the above two points, it is believed that the route and method of using colchicine to treat polyploids should be stopped.)

　　3. An article was published in the newspaper a few days ago saying that disputes in science and technology allow for the existence of minority opinions. Comrade Bao Wenkui's opinions are different from those of the comrades. We allow him to stick to his own opinions and do not force him to accept everyone's opinions, but we hope that he can accept them in the future.

　　This was on November 24, 1954.

　　In the past few years, I don't know how many struggles have been carried out to continue our polyploid research work. The complete cessation of this research work is just the culmination of this issue's struggle. Why are they so determined to oppose polyploidy and colchicine? What is the main basis for opposition? The main basis is nothing more than Academician Lysenko's sentence in the report on the current status of biological science at the All-Union Agricultural Conference in 1948: "This (referring to X-rays, colchicine - author) is not the road of planned selection, not the road of progressive science." If it is not progressive, it is of course backward. It is only natural to oppose and eliminate backward things. At the same time, when talking about polyploidy, one has to talk about chromosomes. Morgan's gene theory says that genes are on chromosomes, so it is inferred that talking about chromosomes and doing polyploid research work is Morganism. Morganism is idealistic, anti-scientific, and reactionary, so it is concluded that doing polyploid research work is also idealistic, anti-scientific, and divorced from politics.

　　However, I think it is completely understandable for a scientist to love the research work he is engaged in and to value even the smallest research results he has obtained. Although all polyploid work was stopped, I did not give up this research work in my mind. We were anxious about the polyploid materials that were stopped from sowing. If these materials could not be sown in the autumn of 1955, all seeds would be completely lost due to their inability to germinate. Therefore, in May of that year, we reported the polyploid problem that occurred here to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Agriculture. About a month later, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Agriculture restoring polyploid research work. In early July, we once again had the opportunity to sow rice polyploid materials. Although the sowing time was too late, we still harvested some seeds of the second generation of tetraploid indica-japonica rice hybrids, and now their third-generation seedlings are growing vigorously. The polyploid materials of barley and other crops that were sown last autumn also yielded better results during the summer harvest this year.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong called on us to march towards science, catch up with the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years, and put forward the policy of implementing "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in science and technology. Premier Zhou Enlai made a "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals," and Minister Lu Dingyi also made a "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" report. All of this fully demonstrates the Party and government's attention and concern for scientific undertakings. I fully agree with what President Guo Moruo said, that letting a hundred schools of thought contend is a socialist competition in science and technology. In this competition, I am determined to strive to be an advanced scientific worker. (Attached pictures)

    我们研究多倍体的前后
    鲍文奎
    谈到植物的多倍体，就得先说一下染色体。染色体是细胞核的主要组成部分之一，在一个植物种中，它的数目一般是一定的。例如普通栽培的小麦有四十二个，水稻有二十四个。在二十世纪初期，植物学家发现在分类上有亲缘关系的植物种，它们的染色体数目常存在一定的倍数关系。例如小麦属中的许多种，它们的染色体数目最少有十四个，其次是二十八个，最多有四十二个。它们都是七的倍数。因之，称十四个染色体的小麦种为二倍体（七的二倍的意思），二十八个染色体的种为四倍体，四十二个染色体的种为六倍体。四倍体，六倍体，都统称为多倍体。
    染色体数目的倍数关系到底包含着什么意义呢？现在为大多数学者所同意的学说是：二倍体的种是原始种，多倍体的种是衍生种。这就是说，多倍体的种是由二倍体的种原始种综合而成的。从杂交试验结合染色体组分析的结果都证实了这个学说。但是，这并不是说所有组成多倍体的二倍体原种都可能找到。因为有的可能尚未被发现，有的可能已被自然界所淘汰。例如直到如今，在小麦属中还只找到一个二倍体的原种，还有两个尚待我们去发现。在芸苔属中已经找到了三个数目不等的二倍体原种，就是：二十个染色体的普通油菜，十八个染色染体的甘兰菜，和十六个染色体的黑油菜，许多芸苔属的多倍体种都已经被证明同这三个原种有亲缘关系。
    多倍体在植物界中占有相当高的比数，这已是为许多统计材料所证明了的事实。我们曾统计一千七百一十一个种子植物的种，其中就有38.17％是多倍体。禾本科植物中，多倍体所占的百分数更高，我们统计一百零七个种，其中就有71.96％是多倍体。所以多倍体在植物种的形成上占有重要的地位是显而易见的。这个自然规律的发现，不但在理论上有它重要的意义，而且在实践上也为人工创造新的植物开辟了途径。根据这个自然规律，我们就有可能创造出许多在地球上尚未存在过的新的植物种。在这方面第一个得到成果的是苏联植物学者卡毕钦科，他在三十年以前，综合了萝卜和甘兰菜得到新的多倍体种，他给所合成的新种命名为萝卜——芸苔属。
    一般远缘杂种第一代的染色体数目只有二个亲本染色体数目之和的一半，而且常常是不孕的。这是由于卵和精子的染色体数目都只有半数（单倍体），所以由之结合而成的还只是二倍体杂种。因此，在人工创造多倍体新种中，首先要解决的一个问题，就是：怎样才能够使染色体数目加倍。所以在这一个时期，许多科学家对加倍染色体问题进行了广泛的研究。这个重要的任务一直到1937年发现秋水仙精的作用，才基本上得到解决。秋水仙精是一种产于地中海沿岸称为秋水仙的植物中所提炼出来的植物硷。经秋水仙精处理杂种种子或幼苗，就可以使原来不孕的二倍体成为能结实的四倍体综合种。所以在1937年以后，许多人工引变的多倍体就创造出来了。这在选种工作上的重要意义，可以从齐津院士的工作中得到充分的说明，他这样说：“利用多倍体现象，我在1947年终于能够制定方法，借它之助，黑麦——鹅冠草第一代杂种不孕性完全被克服。黑麦——鹅冠草杂种不育性的克服是苏维埃选种的伟大胜利。”
    加倍远缘杂种第一代的染色体数目而得到的多倍体称为异源多倍体，因为它的染色体是由不同种的父母本而来的。我们也可以加倍未经过杂交的种的染色体，这样所得到的多倍体称为同源多倍体，因为它的染色体来自同一个种。异源多倍体是综合的新种，它具有新的性质是容易理解的。同源多倍体虽然只是简单的染色体数目的加倍，但比之原来的二倍体，也常出现了新的特性，最常见的如植株变得粗大，花和果实或者种子变大，以及其它生理特性上的改变。这些改变对人类来说常常是有经济价值的。所以巴拉诺夫在一篇“为苏联农业服务的多倍体植物”的论文中总结说：“多倍体是为科学所掌握的自然界的客观规律，必须使它为苏联的农业服务”。
    1950年冬天，我从美国回到了祖国，1951年初并开始了多倍体的引变和选种工作。我们采用秋水仙精处理幼苗的办法，两年中获得了四个品种的大麦同源多倍体，小麦——黑麦远缘杂种异源多倍体，和三个品种的水稻同源多倍体，在1953年我们又得到了几种类型的小麦——黑麦杂种，但是，可惜得很，因为秋水仙精的处理工作被某些人认为是反动的、摩尔根主义的，所以不再应用它进行处理，结果这些未经加倍染色体的杂种都因不孕而未能得到后代。
    无论是同源多倍体或异源多倍体，虽然都能结实，但结实率常常不能达到正常程度，而且种子也常绉缩不饱满。这是运用多倍体规律于禾谷类作物上所遇到的主要困难。这个困难，在我们工作开始前就曾经给予充分的估计。根据秋水仙精对分裂细胞的作用，我初步认为人工引变的多倍体具有高度的同质性，所以它的结实率不高，种子不够饱满，是同多次强迫自交而产生的退化现象相似的。如果这个推理是正确的话，那末只要设法使人工引变的多倍体异质化后，它的结实率和种子饱满度问题就会得到解决。异质化的办法可以用强烈的刺激因素，如紫外光，爱克斯光以及放射性元素而产生的具有高能量的粒子，使有机体从内部发生遗传上的变异；也可以用多倍体品种间杂交的方法使它具有异质性。原来的计划中就同时运用了这两种办法，所以在我回国时，除带了几克秋水仙精外，也带了紫外光管和爱克斯光管。不幸这三样东西都是所里的一些人所反对应用的，因此到1953年起就全都停止运用。紫外光和爱克斯光只在同源四倍体黑麦上试用过一下，因为时间太短，它们的效果无法证实。我想最近的将来在有条件运用原子能的产物放射性元素的时候，这项工作也是值得考虑进行的。
    至于多倍体品种间的杂交工作，到1954年夏收时，就开始得到了明显的效果。那时大麦同源四倍体品种间杂种已到第二代，许多植株的结实率已经接近正常，种子的饱满度也有很明显的增加，许多植株的千粒重比二倍体的原种增加了一倍以上。小麦——黑麦异源多倍体同普通小麦的杂种，也已到第二代，其中也同样的出现了结实率正常，种子饱满，并且生长健旺，看起来是有希望的植株。水稻同源四倍体籼粳杂交到1954年早春在温室内才获得成功。当年第一代杂种的表现就出乎我们意料之外的良好。大家都知道二倍体籼粳杂种第一代可孕性亟低，一般能结种子的小穗不到6％。但是我们所获得的四倍体籼粳杂种第一代，一般的结实率就达到50％左右，种子的千粒重也超过了二倍体的60％。在水稻育种工作中，这个结果是值得重视的。
    就在初步获得结果的1954年，当我们正在整地预备播种麦类多倍体材料的时候，突然所里通知我们停止多倍体研究工作。对于领导方面的这一措施，我们是不同意的。我一方面请领导同志看一下我们已有的材料，同时指出这样的决定是违背不久前才公布的宪法的精神的。另一方面我又请求如果所里不允许我们种，就请拨给我们一小块地，一切费用由我自己负担，我们可以在工余抽出时间来进行研究工作，以便保存这些种子。但这些请求都没有得到许可。结果尚未播种的停止播种，已经播种出苗的四倍体大麦也由秘书室同志带领农工铲除，在钵子里分期播种的小麦——黑麦异源多倍体也在领导同志监督下勒令试验的同志亲手拔除。当时我们的悲痛实在是无法用言语所能形容的。我们为这许多的宝贵材料而痛惜，我们体验到教条主义和权威思想所带来的危害。但我们同时也深信这决不是党和政府对待科学工作的政策。我们的党是根据马克思列宁主义的科学理论所建立起来的实事求是的党。我们毫不怀疑，于人民有利的工作毕竟有一天会得到党和政府的支持。
    不久以后，农业科学研究所的领导方面又要我在四川省全省技术会议上作关于秋水仙精问题的检讨。在会上同志们照例提出了许多尖锐的批评和责难，我的检讨没有能够通过。会后我要求农业科学研究所的领导同志允许我在会上发表我自己对于多倍体问题的意见，得到同意。在第二天的会上我述说了多倍体工作的意义及现在我们已经获得的多倍体材料的情况，并提出了巴拉诺夫通讯院士在1954年第二期苏联植物学杂志上所发表的论文：为“苏联农业服务的多倍体植物”。经过一天的讨论，最后由会议主席宣布了三点结论：
    一、认为应用秋水仙精处理多倍体是脱离实际和脱离政治的。
    二、用秋水仙精处理多倍体是同米丘林学说相冲突的。
    （根据以上两点，认为用秋水仙精处理多倍体的路线和方法应该停止。）
    三、前几天报上曾发表文章说：在科学技术上的争辩是容许少数人的意见存在的。鲍文奎同志的意见和同志们的看法有距离，我们允许他坚持自己的意见，不强迫他接受大家的意见，但希望他将来可以接受。
    这是1954年11月24日的事。
    几年来为了继续我们的多倍体研究工作，不知道进行了多少次的斗争，这次研究工作完全被停止，不过是这个问题斗争的顶点。他们为什么会这样坚决地反对多倍体和秋水仙精呢？反对的主要根据是什么呢？主要的根据不外是李森科院士在1948年全苏农业会议上论生物科学现状报告中的一句话：“这（指爱克斯光，秋水仙精——作者）不是计划选种的道路，不是进步科学的道路”。不是进步的，当然就是落后的。落后的东西应该反对、清除也是理所当然的。同时谈到多倍体就不得不谈到染色体，摩尔根的基因学说就是说基因是在染色体上的，所以就得到推论，谈染色体，做多倍体研究工作就是摩尔根主义。摩尔根主义是唯心的、反科学的、反动的，所以就得出结论做多倍体的研究工作也是唯心的、反科学的、脱离政治的。
    但是，我想一个科学工作者热爱他所进行的研究工作，重视他所得到的即使是很小一点点的研究成果，也是完全可以理解的。虽然一切多倍体工作是被停止了，可是我在思想上并没有放弃这项研究工作。我们对被停止播种的多倍体材料感到焦虑，这些材料如果在1955年秋还不能播种，则所有种子必将因不能发芽而完全损失。所以在是年五月间，我们就向中国科学院和农业部反映这里所发生的多倍体问题。约一个月以后，就得到农业部恢复多倍体研究工作的电报，七月初，我们又才重新得到机会播种水稻多倍体材料，虽然播种时间已太迟，但四倍体籼粳稻杂种第二代还是收获了一部分种子，现在它们的第三代幼苗正在旺盛的生长中。去年秋天播种的大麦等多倍体材料，今年夏收时也得到了较好的结果。
    毛泽东主席号召我们向科学进军，十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平，并提出了在科学技术上要贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，周恩来总理作了“关于知识分子问题的报告”，陆定一部长也作了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告。这一切都充分表示了党和政府对科学事业的重视和关怀。我确信在党和政府的领导下，祖国的科学事业一定会迅速的繁荣起来。我完全同意郭沫若院长所说的，百家争鸣是科学技术的社会主义竞赛。在这个竞赛中我决心努力争取做一个先进的科学工作者。（附图片）
