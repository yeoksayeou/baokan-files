    Shenyang Residents Display Spirit of Unity and Mutual Assistance
    Vacating Over a Thousand Rooms for Families Lacking Housing
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Many residents and private homeowners in Shenyang City, displaying a spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, are enthusiastically helping families lacking housing to solve their housing problems; they have now vacated more than 1,500 public and private rooms for these families to live in.
    This mass house-vacating movement was initiated by Gao Rongyuan, a people's representative of Heping District in Shenyang City, who appealed to all the people in the city. His appeal was met with the support of the vast majority of residents. For example, the residents of No. 4 Wenmiao Hutong in Shenhe District, seeing that Liu Zesen in the backyard needed a house to get married, vacated a room for him. Li Jie, a resident of No. 52 Renyi Street in Heping District, not only vacated his best room but also cleaned it thoroughly, waiting for the families lacking housing to move in.
    The vacated houses are uniformly allocated by the Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau, giving priority to those who urgently need housing. Now, more than 800 families lacking housing have received houses. The family of Wang Jingtao, a resident of No. 10 Yongchang West Hutong in Dadong District, had a house in danger of collapsing due to the sinking foundation, and the whole family was worried all day long. Now, they have moved into a safe residence. Zheng Peichang's wife, an employee of the Municipal Textile Company, had been living in her relatives' house for several years. She is about to have a baby soon, and they very much hoped to have a room of their own. After learning about this situation, the real estate management department has also allocated them a room from the rooms vacated by residents.

    沈阳市居民发挥团结互助精神
    腾出千余间房屋让给缺房户
    本报讯　沈阳市的许多住户和私房业主，发扬团结友爱、互相帮助精神，热情地帮助缺房户解决住房问题；现在已经腾出一千五百多间公房和私房给缺房户住。
    这种群众性的让房行动，是由沈阳市和平区人民代表高荣远，向全市人民倡议而开展起来的。他的倡议提出之后，受到了广大居民的拥护。如沈河区文庙胡同四号的住户，看到后院刘泽森要房子结婚，他们便把一间房让给了他。和平区仁义街五十二号住户李杰，不仅让出了自己最好的房间，还打扫得干干净净，等待缺房户迁入。
    让出来的房屋，都由市房地产管理局统一调配，尽先分配给急需房屋的人住。现在，已经有八百多户缺房户得到了房子。大东区永昌西胡同十号住户汪景涛家里，由于房基下沉，房子有倒塌的危险，一家人整天提心吊胆。现在，他们已经迁入了安全的住宅。市纺织品公司职工郑培畅的妻子，几年来一直住在亲戚家里，最近要生孩子了，他们非常希望自己能有一间屋子，房产管理部门了解到这个情况以后，也已经从居民让出来的房间中，分给她一间。
