    Beijing Team Defeats Marseille Women's Team Yesterday

    (Our Dispatch) Yesterday evening, more than six thousand enthusiastic spectators in the capital braved the rain to watch the match between the women's basketball team of the Marseille University Sports Club of France and the Beijing Women's Basketball Team at the Beijing Gymnasium. The result of the contest between the women's basketball teams from these two Eastern and Western cities with revolutionary traditions was a 53-38 victory for the Beijing team, winning by fifteen points.

    The Marseille University team has a glorious history. In 1945, they were the French champions; from 1944 to 1953, they maintained the title of French university champions for nine years. In yesterday's game, the team's tactics and techniques were better than in their first match on the 28th, with a tight zone defense. When their center, number 12, Libau, was closely guarded by the Beijing team, they covered number 14, Massini, a skilled mid-range shooter. In the last quarter, although three of the Marseille University team's main players were fouled out for committing five fouls, they did not lose by much. The Beijing team has just returned triumphantly from Zhengzhou, and the players are in high spirits and full of morale. Last night, their use of center offense tactics was very successful. Center number 8, Yang Jie, scored four field goals and twelve free throws alone, totaling twenty points. (Jiang Guangyu)

    北京队昨胜马赛女子队
    本报讯　昨天晚间首都六千多热情的观众，冒雨到北京体育馆观看了法国马赛市大学体育俱乐部女子篮球队同北京市女子篮球队的比赛。这两个东西方有着革命传统的城市的女子篮球队交锋结果，北京队以五十三比三十八赢了十五分。
    马赛市大学队过去有着光辉的战绩，1945年他们是法国的冠军队；从1944年到1953年九年中，一直保持了法国大学冠军队的称号。昨天这场比赛，全队的战术和技术比28日初战时表现得更好，联防封锁得很严。当他们的中锋十二号丽苞被北京队看守得很严的时候，就掩护中距离投篮能手十四号玛茜妮投篮。最后一节马赛市大学队虽有三个主力队员因为五次犯规被罚下，但是并没有输多少球。北京队刚刚从郑州载誉归来，队员的精神饱满、士气旺盛。昨晚，他们通过中锋进攻的战术运用得很成功。中锋八号杨洁一个人就投中四个球、罚中十二个球，共得了二十分。（蒋光裕）
