    Stop the Waste of "Happiness"
    In the past two or three years, the trend of holding feasts is still popular. The article "'Third-Class Meals' Cause Unpleasantness" in the People's Daily on August 11 mentioned that when the newly built Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 vertical shafts of the Huainan Coal Mine held the transfer to production ceremony in July, a banquet was held. As far as I know, when a newly built factory is put into production, when a power station is completed and generates electricity, and when some meetings open and close, banquets are often held to entertain guests. The host feels that it is decent and generous, and the guests can enjoy a feast, which is truly a "win-win for everyone."
    We should not oppose banquets across the board. In certain occasions (such as entertaining foreign guests), banquets are still indispensable. However, if we regard banquets as one of the contents of celebrating and commemorating the completion of projects, holding meetings, etc., and form a habit, as if completion and meetings must be accompanied by banquets, then it becomes a waste of "happiness."
    Think about it, how many projects in our country will be completed one after another, and how many meetings will be held in succession? If banquets are held every time, how much valuable construction funds will be spent?

    停止“快乐”的浪费
    最近两三年来，会餐之风仍在流行。八月十一日人民日报“‘三等餐’引起的不愉快”一文里就说，淮南煤矿新建的谢家集二号和三号竖井七月间举行移交生产仪式的时候，举行了会餐。据我知道的，一个新建的工厂投入生产、一个电站建成发电、一些会议开幕和闭幕，往往都要置办酒席，大宴宾客。主人觉得体面、大方，客人得以豪吃痛饮，真正是“皆大欢喜”。
    我们不应当一律反对会餐，在某些场合里（如宴请外宾），会餐还是不可少的。但是，如果把会餐当成庆祝和纪念工程完工、开会等等的内容之一，相习成风，好像完工、开会就非会餐不可，那就成了一种“快乐”的浪费。
    想想看，我们国家有多少项工程要陆续完工，有多少个会议要相继召开？要是每次都举行会餐，得花掉多少宝贵的建设资金？　　　	内五
