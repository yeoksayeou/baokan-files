Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 2nd. More than two thousand four hundred Qingtian stone carvings were recently shipped directly from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, to the Soviet Union. These stone carvings are all exquisite works of art and handicrafts carefully carved by the artists, including large-scale landscapes, vases, and delicate ashtrays. They are part of the 15,000 Qingtian stone carvings ordered by the Soviet Union from China this year.

Qingtian stone carving is a famous folk art and handicraft in China. This stone carving craft has a history of more than 700 years. Many excellent works have participated in international and domestic exhibitions and enjoy a high reputation at home and abroad.

In order to ensure the quality of the stone carvings for export and to increase new varieties, the artisans engaged in stone carving have organized research groups and inspection groups in each handicraft production cooperative to which they belong.
