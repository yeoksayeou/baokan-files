Strange Attitudes Towards Private Individuals
　　Zhang Shihong

The Shanghai Steel Window Factory has been a joint state-private enterprise for over four years. However, for more than four years, Wang Yimin, the private representative of the factory, has had no work to do and has been subjected to undue coldness and discrimination.

Wang Yimin is sixty-four years old this year. As early as 1950, he applied for joint ownership and requested to "dedicate" the factory twice. After the joint venture, he took the initiative to ask for work, saying: "I am old and hope to make some contributions to socialist construction in the limited few years." This request is also completely reasonable, but it has not been supported and valued by the public representatives. The public factory director set up a separate office for Wang Yimin. In fact, he had no official business to handle. Every day he just went to work and got off work, went to the workshop to take a look, and read newspapers and magazines; he was not invited to attend any administrative meetings or production meetings in the factory, and the public representatives ignored him when they saw him; the workers were afraid of being labeled as "leaning towards the bourgeoisie," and they dared not approach him.

Such treatment of private representatives certainly does not lead to the transformation of people, and it is also completely detrimental to the development of the enterprise. Wang Yimin worked as a construction engineer before liberation, specializing in reinforced concrete design. He has rich technical experience and management skills, and he is also familiar with the potential strength of the factory. For example, last year, when the public factory director and the party branch secretary went to Beijing for a meeting, a military unit wanted to order Czech-style steel window columns and ran to several large cities but could not find a factory that could accept the task. Later, they found the Shanghai Steel Window Factory. This factory had never produced this product before and originally intended not to accept it, but after Wang Yimin took the initiative to study it, personally designed it, and offered ideas, it was trial-produced by experienced old workers, and the task was finally completed on schedule, which greatly satisfied the military unit. Obviously, this kind of production initiative and enthusiasm of private individuals is very beneficial to the development of the enterprise and should be encouraged. But on the contrary, because this technical experience is in the hands of Wang Yimin, a capitalist, he is treated coldly and despised everywhere. For example, once a worker put forward a rationalization proposal, and the technical section drew drawings according to this proposal. Wang pointed out that this design was not safe enough and a device should be added, but the technical section did not accept it, insisting that there was no problem with safety. In the end, the facts proved that Wang's suggestion was correct.

Why should such a cold and discriminatory attitude be adopted towards a private representative who has technical experience and is willing to accept transformation? In addition to the fact that the Metal Structure Bureau, the department in charge of this factory, should be responsible for the delay in arranging Wang's work, and that the former public representative Hao Chengxi had a relatively serious sectarian mood, the main reason is that the public personnel and party organization of this factory have the following two one-sided and erroneous views:

First, they have always believed that treating private representatives in this way means taking a firm stand and drawing a clear line with the bourgeoisie. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the cadre's class consciousness in this factory improved, and the line with the capitalists was drawn clearly, which is good. But this led to an extremely naive idea, as if "drawing a clear line of class" meant breaking off all relations with the capitalists. Any connection with the capitalists was a sign of an unstable position. Last year, a public factory director from this factory went to Wang Yimin's home once, smoked a cigarette and left, and immediately reported it to the branch secretary for the record, fearing that others would say that he had lost his position. There are other similar examples. This understanding of "taking a firm stand" is obviously wrong. Because they neither saw the positive side of private individuals nor did they see the profound changes that have taken place in class relations in recent years. They don't know that without contacting private individuals and without working on them, it is impossible to complete the task of dual transformation. In order to transform people, detailed and patient work should be carried out. There should be a lot of contact with them in work, thought, and daily life. As long as this contact is conducive to their transformation, it is necessary and not terrible. This kind of contact will only gradually change the position of private individuals, and for public personnel, there is no question of position involved.

Second, they only see the shortcomings and weaknesses of private individuals and cannot see their advantages and positive aspects. When people talk to the public representatives of this factory about Wang Yimin, they emphasize Wang Yimin's shortcomings and weaknesses, saying that he has some historical problems, that he is afraid of hardship at work and lacks a sense of responsibility, and that he still has some selfish plans after the joint venture, and so on. These may all be facts. But what is so strange about that? Isn't it precisely because they were once capitalists, with the essence of capitalists and various ideological characteristics, that we need to transform them through persuasive education? It is unrealistic to think that the various performances of private individuals must be the same as those of public personnel, and to require them to be at the level of revolutionary cadres. But this unrealistic idea has become one of the reasons why this factory does not assign work to Wang Yimin. They do not give him opportunities for practical exercise on the one hand, and they want him to make progress on the other hand. How is this possible? Isn't this as absurd as wanting someone to learn to swim but not allowing him to go into the water?

Now, the problems of this factory have been initially resolved due to the intervention of higher-level leading organs. But the above two one-sided and erroneous views can be found in almost all joint ventures where public-private relations are not handled well. This view is caused by the narrowness, one-sidedness, and lack of developmental perspective in the thinking methods of many of our comrades. They only see certain negative factors of private individuals that are being transformed and gradually weakened, and they cannot see the positive factors that are developing and strengthening. Their vision is too old, too outdated, and too small to keep up with the ever-changing development of reality, which will inevitably greatly increase the difficulties in their work and cause us to encounter obstacles that could have been avoided in improving the public-private relations of joint ventures.

    对私方人员的奇异态度
    章世鸿
    上海钢窗厂公私合营已四年多了。但是，四年多以来，这个厂的私方代表王逸民一直没有工作可做，而且长期受到不应有的冷淡和歧视。
    王逸民今年六十四岁了，早在1950年他就申请合营，而且两次要求“献”厂。合营以后，他又主动要求工作，他说：“我年纪已老，希望在有限的几年中能对社会主义建设作一些贡献。”这种要求也是完全合理的，但却得不到公方代表的支持和重视。公方厂长为王逸民设了一间单独的办公室。事实上他是无公可办，每天只是上班下班，到车间转一转，看看书报；厂内开任何行政会议、生产会议都不叫他出席，公方代表看到他也不理睬；职工怕被套上“靠拢资产阶级”的帽子，也不敢和他接近。
    这样对待私方代表，当然谈不到对人的改造，而且对企业的发展来说也是完全不利的。王逸民解放前任过建筑工程师，专门从事钢骨水泥设计，有丰富的技术经验，也有管理能力，对本厂的潜在力量也很熟悉。举个例说，去年公股厂长和党支部书记去北京开会时间，一个部队机关要订购捷克式钢窗柱，跑了几个大城市，找不到能接受这批任务的工厂，后来找到了上海钢窗厂。这个厂过去也没有生产过这种产品，原拟不接受，但经王逸民主动加以研究后，亲自设计，出主意，由有技术的老工人试制，终于如期完成了任务，部队机关极感满意。显然，私方人员这种生产上的主动性和积极性是十分有利于企业的发展的，应该受到鼓励。但恰恰相反，因为这种技术经验是被王逸民这个资本家掌握了，就处处遭到冷淡和轻视。比如有一次工人提出一个合理化建议，技术科按这个建议画图纸，王提出这样设计还不够安全，应加上一个什么装置，但技术科不接受，硬说安全没有问题。最后，事实证明还是王的建议是正确的。
    为什么对这样一个有技术经验而又愿意接受改造的私方代表要采取这种冷淡和歧视的态度呢？除了这个厂的主管部门金属结构总局不应该对王的工作迟迟不作安排，和前公方代表郝成禧有比较严重的宗派主义情绪，应该负一定的责任以外，主要还是由于这个厂的公方人员和党组织存在着下面两种片面的错误的观点：
    第一，他们一直认为这样对待私方代表，才是站稳了立场，和资产阶级划清了界线。“五反”以后，这个厂的干部阶级觉悟提高了，和资本家的界线划清了，这是好的。但由此就产生一种极其幼稚的想法，似乎“划清阶级界线”就是和资本家一刀两断，任何和资本家的联系都是立场不稳的表现。去年，这个厂一个公方厂长到王逸民家去了一次，抽一枝烟就走，回来还立即向支部书记汇报备案，深怕别人说他丧失立场。还有其他类似的例子。这样理解“站稳立场”，显然是错误的。因为他们既没有看到私方人员的积极性一面，也没有看到几年来阶级关系所发生的深刻变化。他们不知道，不和私方人员发生联系，不对他们进行工作，就无法完成双重改造的任务。为了改造人，就应该进行细致的耐心的工作，就应该和他们在工作上、思想上、日常生活上发生很多的联系，这种联系只要有利于对他们的改造，都是必要的而不是可怕的。这种联系只会逐步改变私方人员的立场，而对公方人员来说，则并没有涉及什么立场问题。
    第二，只看到私方人员的短处和缺点，看不见他们的优点和积极的一面。当人们和这个厂的公方代表谈到王逸民时，他们强调王逸民的短处和缺点，说他有一些历史问题，说他工作上怕艰苦，责任心不强，说他合营后仍有一些自私自利的打算，等等。这些可能都是事实。但有什么值得奇怪的呢？难道不正是因为他们曾经是资本家，具有资本家的本质和各种思想特点，我们才需要通过说服教育方式来对他们进行改造吗？以为私方人员的各种表现必须和公方人员一样，用革命干部的水平去要求他们，这是不实际的。但这种不实际的想法竟成为这个厂不分配王逸民工作的理由之一。他们一方面不给他实际锻炼的机会；一方面又要他进步，这怎么可能呢？这不正好像要一个人学会游泳但又不准他下水一样荒谬吗？
    现在，这个厂的问题由于上级领导机关的干预已初步得到了解决。但上面这两种片面的错误观点几乎在公私关系搞得不够好的合营厂中都可以找到。这种观点是由于我们许多同志思想方法上的狭窄性、片面性和缺乏发展的观点所造成的。他们只看到私方人员某些正在改造并且逐步削弱着的消极因素，而看不到正在发展着、增强着的积极因素。他们的眼光太老、太旧、太小，跟不上一日千变的现实的发展，这就势必大大加重了工作中的困难，使我们在改善合营企业公私关系中遭到本来可以避免的阻力。
