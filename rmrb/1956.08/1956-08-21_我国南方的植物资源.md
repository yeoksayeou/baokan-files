    Plant Resources in Southern China
    Huang Chengjiu
    No other country in the world has such a vast latitudinal range as China, spanning both the tropics and temperate zones. Our southernmost point, Zengmu Ansha, is located at approximately 4 degrees north latitude, while our northernmost point reaches 53 degrees 25 minutes north latitude. In terms of plant resources, China is the richest country in the world. This region, endowed with exceptionally favorable natural conditions, not only supports a diverse range of plants but also allows for the cultivation of various economic crops introduced from tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Southern China serves as the base and treasure trove for our nation's tropical and subtropical plant resources, holding immense significance for our socialist construction in terms of defense, economy, and scientific research.
    Southern China, influenced by warm air masses from the equatorial Pacific, tropical Pacific, and Indian Ocean, is characterized by high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and high humidity.
    Rubber is an essential material for industry, medical equipment, and our daily lives. The Brazilian rubber tree, reaching up to 30 meters in height, has already been planted in southern China and is thriving.
    There are also cultivated and naturally growing tropical and subtropical oil crops with high oil yields and excellent quality. Coconut trees, reaching 20-30 meters in height and containing high oil content (approximately 20 jin of oil per 100 coconuts), are planted in southern Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan, as well as on the various small islands of Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands. Hainan Island also cultivates oil palm, a tropical species, which is the oil crop with the highest oil yield per unit area in the world (the highest oil yield of oil palm is about 3,000 kilograms per hectare, while the general oil yield of peanuts is only 300 kilograms per hectare). Coconuts are edible, and coconut oil and palm oil are industrial oils, used as lubricants, rust inhibitors, and basic raw materials for making soap and candles. The outer pericarp of coconuts can also be made into ship ropes, cords, and other products. Its straight and sturdy trunk is also used as a roof beam, which is not only beautiful but also durable.
    Castor bean, growing in Hainan Island, Yunnan, and southern Taiwan, is a perennial tree (while in north of the Yangtze River, it is an annual dwarf plant), flowering and bearing fruit all year round. Its seeds are large, and its oil yield is particularly high. Castor oil is a high-grade machine lubricating oil, used as a lubricant for airplanes and automobiles, and it is also a medicinal laxative, with a wide range of uses.
    Many sea buckthorn trees, another excellent oil plant, also grow semi-wild in Hainan Island.
    Southern China also grows tropical fiber plants with extremely high yields and excellent quality. Such as sisal, Mauritius hemp, false pineapple hemp, and other hard fibers belonging to the Agavaceae family, as well as abaca, Java kapok, etc. In addition, there are many wild fiber plants that have not yet been studied and utilized. These plants are the main raw materials for the defense industry and the textile industry, which can be made into nautical ropes, linen fabrics, sacks, photographic sensitive paper, banknotes, etc.
    Cinchona trees, which grow well, are cultivated in southern Yunnan and Taiwan. Quinine is currently still an important medicine in the treatment of malaria. As for wild medicinal plants such as borneol Ai, etc., there are countless.
    Some excellent volatile oil plants, such as citronella, patchouli, eucalyptus, and geranium, have a wider range of uses. Cinnamon oil, star anise oil, and scented grasses, etc., can only grow in large quantities in the south.
    In Hainan Island and southern Yunnan and Taiwan, there are also beverage crops such as coffee and cocoa. Pepper, used for seasoning and spices, is also planted in Hainan Island.
    As for the fruits we eat every day, they are even more abundant. There are world-famous lychees; pineapples, citrus fruits, and bananas, which support our country's socialist construction and earn foreign exchange through large-scale exports; lemons and Dragon Tooth bananas, which were "tributes" during the Tang and Song dynasties; mangoes, known as the "king of tropical fruits"; avocados and sapodilla, which are not often heard of but contain rich nutritional value; and jackfruit, Lingnan papaya, longan, custard apple, mangosteen, wampee, star fruit, plantain, rose apple, etc. According to the report by Professor Hou Kuangzhao and others, there are about 130 kinds of fruits in South China alone.
    Sugarcane is also a specialty of the South. It grows well and fast in the South, with high sugar yield and good quality. In fact, southern China has become an important base for our country's cane sugar industry.
    Tannins, which are indispensable to the leather industry, are also grown in southern China, such as mangroves and other types of tannin plants.
    Rice, in the South, due to its unique natural conditions, can be planted three times a year in some areas. The national record for the highest yield per unit area is often in the South, but there, the potential for increasing grain yield per unit area is still very large.
    Although the natural forest area in southern China is second only to the Southwest and Northeast, it is more abundant and faster than other regions in terms of the diversity of tree species and growth rate. Generally speaking, their growth rate is two to three times faster than that in the Northeast. In Hainan Island, usually after a forest is completely felled (or burned out), it can grow into a dense coppice forest of 2-4 meters high in two or three years.
    The South also produces a very strong hardwood that is resistant to acid and alkali - rosewood (wild lychee wood); high-grade furniture wood with fine texture, excellent quality, and small specific gravity - teak, as well as soft wood with excellent quality (coniferous plants) and innumerable famous hardwoods, such as rouge, oil dan, bitter catalpa, Musheng, red Machilus, green plum, hopea, Phoebe nanmu, camphorwood, and the very precious Verrucano tree, which was recently discovered in large quantities by botanists, etc.
    One of the noteworthy and relatively primitive ferns with a simple internal structure - Psilotum nudum, is commonly seen in the forests south of central Hainan Island. Metasequoia, which existed in large quantities in the late Mesozoic Era but is on the verge of extinction on today's earth, only exists alive along the inland rivers of southern China. There are indeed many unique plants in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and southeastern Yunnan, especially in the latter region, which is very worthy of our vigorous investigation and research. For example, Rhodoleia championii, distributed in the Shiwan Dashan Mountains and southeastern Yunnan, which was first collected by Professor Qin Renchang, a Chinese botanist, is a rare and special plant.
    Many foreign tropical plants are also planted in Hainan Island, such as the traveler's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis) originating from Madagascar. The tree shape is like a banana, but the upper part of the stem is flat and stores a lot of water. If you drill a small hole in the stem, there will be a constant flow of water to quench your thirst. Tropical travelers like it very much and call it the traveler's tree.
    There are so many kinds of plants in the South that we have only mentioned one or two out of a thousand. It should be known that the number of plant species in the urban area of Guangzhou alone (about 1,600 species) is about the same as the number of plants in the entire Hebei Province. In short, the diversity of plants and the available plant resources in southern China are extremely rich.
    Due to the special geographical environment and climatic conditions in southern China, it plays an extremely important role in supporting national industrialization, improving people's living standards, and in the research value of botany. In recent years, the specific figures from agricultural harvests, forest product utilization, and the export of agricultural economic crops have fully demonstrated the important significance of the plant resources in this region.
    Our great motherland's South, this inexhaustible treasure house of terrestrial resources, we must pay good attention to it, study it, and make good use of it, it will play a huge role in our socialist construction. (Attached pictures)

    我国南方的植物资源
    黄成就
    世界上没有一个国家，在纬度的幅员上有如我国地跨热带和温带这样辽阔广大，最南点从北纬约四度曾母暗沙起至最北点北纬五十三度二十五分止，在这个由南至北的土地上，就植物资源来说，我国是世界上植物资源最丰富的国家。在这个具有十分优越的自然条件的地区里，不但生长着种类繁多的植物，而且还可以栽种由南洋热带地区引进的好些经济作物。我国的南方，是我国热带、亚热带植物资源的基地和宝库，它对我国社会主义建设，无论在国防上，经济上和科学研究上都具有重大意义。
    我国的南方，由于受到赤道太平洋，热带太平洋和印度洋暖气团的影响，形成了气温高、雨量多、湿度大等特征。
    橡胶是工业、医疗用具以至我们日常生活上需用的重要物资。高达三十公尺的巴西橡胶树在我国的南方已有栽植，并且生长得很好。
    那里还有人工栽种的和天然生长的产油量很高，品质优良的热带、亚热带油类作物。在云南、广西、广东、福建和台湾的南部以及海南岛和西沙群岛的各个小岛屿上都栽种着高达二三十米的，含油量很高的（一百个椰子约产油二十斤）椰子树；在海南岛还栽种一种原产热带的油棕，它是世界上油料作物中单位面积产油量最高的油料作物（世界上每公顷的最高产油量油棕约三千公斤，而花生的一般产油量每公顷只三百公斤）。椰子可供食用，椰油和油棕油都是工业用油，可作润滑剂，防锈剂以及用作制造肥皂、蜡烛等的基本原料；椰子的外果皮还可以制成船缆、绳索和其他用品，至于它的挺直而坚实的树干，人们还用来做屋梁，不但美观，而且耐用。
    生长在海南岛、云南和台湾南部的蓖麻是多年生的乔木（生长在长江以北的是一年生的矮小植物），一年四季都开花结实，种子很大，产油量也特别高。蓖麻油是一种高级的机器润滑油，可用作飞机和汽车的润滑剂，它也是医药上的轻泻剂，用途很广。
    在海南岛还半野生着很多海棠树，它也是一种很好的油类植物。
    在我国南方还生长有产量极高，品质优良的热带麻类纤维植物。如剑麻、番麻、假菠萝麻以及其他属于龙舌兰科的硬质麻类和蕉麻、爪哇木棉，等等。此外，还有不少尚未加以研究和利用的野生麻类植物，这类植物是国防工业和纺织工业的主要原料，它可制成航海用的绳缆、麻质布料、麻袋、照相用的感光纸、货币纸，等等。
    在云南和台湾南部栽种着生长良好的金鸡纳树。金鸡纳霜在医治疟疾方面目前还是一种重要药品之一，至于野生药用植物如冰片艾等等，更是数不胜数了。
    一些很好的挥发性油类植物，例如香茅、广藿香、桉树和香叶等，用途更广的如桂皮油、八角茴香油和瑶香草等，只有在南方才能大量生长。
    在海南岛和云南、台湾的南部，还有饮料作物如咖啡和可可，作调味用和香料用的胡椒也在海南岛种植起来了。
    至于我们日常食用的果品更是丰富。那里有名闻世界的荔枝；有支援我国进行社会主义建设换取资金、大量出口的菠萝、柑橘类和香蕉等；有在唐朝和宋朝时期作为“贡品”的柠檬和龙牙蕉；有号称热带果王的芒果；有一般人不常听见过的但含有丰富营养价值的鳄梨和人心果；此外还有木菠萝（菠萝蜜）、岭南木瓜、龙眼、番荔枝、山竹、黄皮、阳桃、芭蕉、蒲桃，等等。根据侯宽昭等教授的报告，仅在华南地区就有为数约一百三十种的果品。
    甘蔗也是南方特产之一。它在南方生长得又好又快，产糖量高，品质又好，事实上，我国的南方已经是我国蔗糖工业的重要基地了。
    制革工业不能少的单宁，在我国南方也生长着如红树等等种类甚多的单宁植物。
    水稻，在南方由于自然条件得天独厚，有些地区一年可种三熟。全国单位面积最高额的丰产纪录常在南方，然而，那里对于提高粮食单位面积产量的潜在力还是很大的。
    我国南方天然林面积虽然次于西南和东北，可是，在树种的多样性和生长速度方面都较其他地区多且快。一般说它们的生长速度要比东北的快两、三倍。在海南岛，通常一个森林被彻底地全部砍伐（或烧光）之后，经过两三年的时间，又可以长成两至四公尺高的密茂的萌生林了。
    在南方还出产耐酸耐碱性很强的十分坚实的硬木——酸枝（野生的荔枝木材）；纹理细密，质地优良，比重很小的高级家具木材——柚木以及品质优良的软木材（松柏类植物）和不胜枚举的著名的硬木材，如胭脂、油丹、苦梓、母生、红椤、青梅、坡垒、楠木、樟木，和最近由植物学家大量发现的十分珍贵的蚬木，等等。
    引人注意的、它的内部结构较简单而相当原始的蕨类植物之一种——松叶兰，在海南岛的中部以南的树林中到处可见。约在中生代的末期已大量存在但是在今天的地球上行将灭绝的水松，只有在我国南方的内河沿岸仍有活的存在。台湾、海南岛和云南东南部等地的特有植物实在不少，尤其是在后一个区域里，很值得我们大力进行调查研究。例如分布在十万大山以至云南东南部的，首先由我国植物学家秦仁昌教授采到的马尾树等就是罕见的特殊植物。
    在海南岛还栽种了好些外来的热带植物，例如原产马达加斯加的旅人木（旅人蕉），树形像芭蕉，但茎干的上部是扁的，贮水很多，如果在茎干上钻一个小洞，就有可以解渴的水源源流出。热带旅行者们很喜欢它，把它叫做旅人木。
    南方植物种类繁多，我们仅仅说出了不过是千分之一、二。要知道，仅广州市市区的植物种类（约1，600种）在数目上已经和河北省全省的植物相差不多了。总之，在我国的南方，植物的多种多样性及其可利用的植物资源是极其丰富的。
    由于我国南方具有地理环境和气候条件的特殊优越性，它无论在支援国家工业化，提高人民生活水平以及在植物学方面的研究价值上都起着极其重要的作用。几年来，从农业收成林产利用和农业经济作物的输出的具体数字上，已经充分地说明了这个地区的植物资源的重要意义了。
    我们伟大祖国的南方，这个无尽藏的地上资源的宝库，我们要很好地重视它，研究它和很好地去利用它，它将为我们的社会主义建设发挥巨大的作用。（附图片）
