The Western European "Common Market" and "Free Trade Area"
Mi Bing

The six countries of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and West Germany have been discussing the "European Common Market" plan in negotiations in Brussels this year. This plan has been put on the agenda as a step in the "Little Europe" scheme long planned by the United States and the ruling groups of Western European countries.

Britain has expressed unusual concern about this issue. Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan stated that he would maintain contact with Spaak (Belgian Foreign Minister), the host of the Brussels six-nation talks, to coordinate their efforts. Britain is attempting to expand the Common Market plan to all member states of the European Economic Cooperation Agency to form a broad Western European "Free Trade Area" as a flank of the proposed "Third Economic Force."

The "Common Market" plan is linked to the United States' policy of enslaving Western European countries. But this is only one aspect of the problem. There is another aspect that cannot be ignored, namely the various forces within Europe and their development trends, and the role these forces play as factors determining European issues. The "Common Market" issue contains complex and intertwined contradictions, the most important of which are the contradictions between Britain and the United States, between West Germany and Britain and France, and between most Western European countries and the United States.

The United States is attempting to build a "United States of Europe" on the basis of destroying the sovereignty of Western European countries. The "Common Market" plan is a step towards unifying Europe economically. The "European Coal and Steel Community" was actually established five years ago as a preparatory stage for the "Common Market" and as its core. The member states participating in the "European Coal and Steel Community" are the main body of "Little Europe." The "Common Market" plan is an attempt to establish an all-encompassing international cartel in order to set uniform European market prices that are favorable to American procurement and sales, and to control resources and markets.

In this plan of the United States, West Germany plays a particularly important role. The United States attempts to use West Germany's dominance in the Western European market as a means to promote this plan, and to control West Germany's activities in the European market through its influence over West Germany and its economic ties with West Germany.

However, the trade and tariff policies of the United States in the post-war period have aroused dissatisfaction among most Western European countries. The contradictions between these countries (including Britain) and the United States have become increasingly acute. Therefore, the implementation of the United States' plan to control the Western European market cannot but encounter strong resistance.

Since 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has lowered the tariffs of most Western European countries. However, the United States still maintains its own tariff barriers. Due to the implementation of unequal tariff policies, the trade deficits and international balance of payments deficits of many Western European countries have increased. Gold and dollar shortages have swept through most of Western Europe. How to get rid of this predicament has become a common demand of Western European countries. In recent years, these countries have formed a common pressure on the United States, forcing the United States to lower tariffs so that their goods can enter the United States domestic market under more favorable conditions. In order to ease the dissatisfaction of Western European countries, prevent the development of centrifugal tendencies, and prevent the relationship between the United States and European neutral countries from further deteriorating, the United States has had to make certain concessions verbally or in practice.

The fourth meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which lasted for four months from January to May this year, was convened under these circumstances. At the meeting, the United States made some concessions to individual major countries participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but most Western European countries did not get the results they expected. The meeting did not solve the difficulties they faced.

Britain originally attempted to share the extra profits in international trade through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, Britain did not get its wish. Although Britain maintained higher tariff levels compared to the European low-tax countries, and gained some benefits by reducing tariff preferences for imports from other Commonwealth countries in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade weakened the Imperial Preference system. According to the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, when goods from the United States and other competitors enter the markets of Commonwealth member states, they also receive preferential treatment. The benefits that Britain enjoys from the Imperial Preference system are in danger of being divided. Under these circumstances, Britain has had to re-examine its trade and tariff policies to deal with competition from the United States.

In order to gain benefits in the European market, West Germany actively responded to the instigation of the United States. In the proposed "Common Market," West Germany will occupy a dominant position. With its overwhelming economic and technological advantages, it attempts to manipulate other countries within the "Common Market." Due to the inherent foundation of West German industry, its rapid expansion and the adoption of new technologies in the post-war period, coupled with lower wage levels, the cost of West German industrial products is much lower than that of other Western European countries. Therefore, in export trade, other Western European countries find it difficult to compete with West Germany. At present, West Germany has not only regained the foreign markets it lost at the end of the war, but also seized a part of the overseas markets of Britain and France. Due to its trade advantage, West Germany is in an absolutely dominant creditor position within the Payment Union. Under these circumstances, what can the establishment of a unified market mean for countries with relatively weak competitiveness such as France and Italy? These countries should be able to gain a lot of inspiration from the activities of the "European Coal and Steel Community" over the past few years.

Therefore, no matter how temporarily tolerant the ruling groups of other Western European countries are towards West Germany's economic expansion policy, West Germany's re-entry into the European market as a strong competitor will inevitably and has already sharpened its contradictions with other Western European countries.

The establishment of a "Common Market" dominated by West Germany means the weakening of Britain's economic position in Europe. Britain will certainly not take a cold attitude towards such an issue that is closely related to its own interests.

The purpose of Britain's organization of the Western European "Free Trade Area" is to seize economic control over Europe from the United States and West Germany, establish a Western European trade group led by Britain, and complement the Commonwealth and Sterling Area markets. In practice, Britain intends to first implement so-called trade "liberalization," and then carry out tariff adjustments at an appropriate time. Britain attempts to attract capital from the Western European region to the track of the Commonwealth through these steps in order to meet the urgent needs of the Commonwealth countries for capital. Not long ago, the Undersecretary of Economic Affairs of the British Treasury said in the House of Commons that the "Common Market" plan should not only stipulate a single external tariff, but also be linked to the free flow of capital and labor. He said that such a common market has a strong ability to resist external competition.

Western European countries, including Britain, have been severely hit by the United States and West Germany in terms of market and tariff interests. This common situation has created a certain possibility for coordination between Britain and most European countries on trade and tariff issues.

At the recent meeting of the Ministerial Council of the European Economic Cooperation Agency held in Paris, Britain expressed its active desire to organize a Western European "Free Trade Area." The meeting, chaired by Macmillan, discussed trade "liberalization" and tariff issues. However, no final agreement was reached on these two issues. The participating countries agreed to postpone the provision of 90% trade "liberalization" for another eighteen months. The meeting discussed automatic tariff reductions on "European goods" agreed upon unanimously, and the establishment of trade and tariff links between the countries participating in the "Common Market" plan and other member states of the European Economic Cooperation Agency. Britain showed a delaying attitude on the issue of tariff reduction. Britain's consideration is first to buy enough time to seek appropriate ways to resolve the contradictions between the Imperial Preference system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that may be caused by tariff reductions in the European region. Secondly, Britain attempts to use the desire of low-tax countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries) to urgently reduce tariff barriers to pull these countries into its "Free Trade Area" plan. Therefore, Britain will not easily promise tariff reduction measures before these countries agree to this plan. Third, on the issue of tariff reduction itself, Britain attempts to strive for a solution that is unilaterally beneficial to itself, that is, Britain still maintains higher tariff levels than other low-tax countries. In the past, there was talk in Britain about the issue of "secondary preferential" arrangements in the Western European region. The so-called "secondary preferential" is in relation to the "Imperial Preference system," and its preferential rate and scope are subject to the provisions of the "Imperial Preference system." Judging from Britain's current activities in Europe, the spirit of the "secondary preferential" arrangement will be embodied in Britain's future tariff policies towards Western European countries.

However, can Britain or other European low-tax countries rely on these methods to enhance their respective economic positions? Today, these countries have still not completely freed themselves from their dependence on the United States. They still follow the dangerous policy of arming West Germany. They still bear heavy military obligations, and huge amounts of funds are tied up in arms production or consumed as direct military expenditures. Therefore, the speed of fixed capital innovation in civilian industries and the rise in production indices in these countries appear slow. Their competitiveness in foreign markets is still relatively weak. Under these circumstances, the "Free Trade Area" plan cannot help Britain or any other Western European country get rid of the difficulties they face. The establishment of the "Common Market" will only further marginalize and enslave these countries economically.

In order to get rid of the difficult economic situation they are currently in, Western European countries cannot abandon national sovereignty; on the contrary, they should strengthen national sovereignty. Western European countries, including Western European powers such as Britain, France, and Italy, particularly need independent trade and tariff policies to protect their own interests and develop trade relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. They should fundamentally change their current policies towards West Germany to prevent threats from West Germany, while at the same time getting rid of the burden of armaments and transferring manpower and resources to the track of peaceful industries in order to improve the living standards of the vast majority of the people and export capabilities. Only in this way can Western European countries truly enhance their own independent economic position.

    西欧“共同市场”与“自由贸易区域”
    弭兵
    法、意、荷、比、卢和西德等六个国家今年在布鲁塞尔进行的谈判中，讨论了“欧洲共同市场”计划。这一计划作为美国与西欧国家统治集团久已筹划的“小欧洲”方案的一个步骤而提上了议事日程。
    英国在这一问题上表示了异常的关切。财政大臣麦克米伦声明他将与布鲁塞尔六国谈判主持人斯巴克（比利时外交大臣）保持接触，以协调彼此的努力。英国企图把共同市场的计划扩大到所有欧洲经济合作局成员国家，以形成广泛的西欧“自由贸易区域”，作为正在拟议中的“第三种经济力量”的侧翼。
    “共同市场”计划是与美国奴役西欧各国的政策相联系的。但是这只是问题的一方面。还有不可忽视的一面，就是欧洲内部的各种力量及其发展趋势，以及这些力量作为决定欧洲问题的因素所起的作用。在“共同市场”问题上，包含着复杂的、互相交织着的矛盾，其中最主要的是英美矛盾、西德和英法之间的矛盾、大多数西欧国家和美国之间的矛盾。
    美国企图在摧毁西欧各国主权的基础上来建立起“欧洲合众国”。“共同市场”计划便是从经济方面统一欧洲的一个步骤。“煤钢联营”实际上是作为“共同市场”的准备阶段，同时又是作为它的核心而在五年以前建立起来的。参加“煤钢联营”的各成员国，便是“小欧洲”的主体。“共同市场”的计划是企图建立起包罗万象的国际卡特尔，以便规定对美国采购和销售有利的统一的欧洲市场价格，控制资源与市场。
    在美国这一计划中，西德起着特殊重要的作用。美国企图以西德在西欧市场上的优势作为推行这一计划的手段，并通过自己对于西德的影响和同西德之间的经济联系来控制西德在欧洲市场上的活动。
    但是，美国在战后时期的贸易和关税政策引起了大多数西欧国家的不满。这些国家（包括英国在内）与美国的矛盾日益尖锐化。因此，美国企图控制西欧市场的计划的实行，便不能不遇到强大的阻力。
    1947年以来，国际关税与贸易总协定压低了多数西欧国家的关税。然而美国却依然保持着自己的关税壁垒。由于不平等的关税政策的实施，增大了许多西欧国家的贸易逆差和国际收支赤字。黄金和美元荒席卷了大部分西欧地区。如何摆脱这种困境，成了西欧国家的共同要求。近几年来，这些国家对美国形成了一种共同的压力，逼迫美国降低关税，以便它们的商品在比较有利的条件下进入美国国内市场。美国为了缓和西欧国家的不满，以防止离心倾向的发展，并使美国与欧洲中立国家的关系不至进一步趋于恶化，不得不在口头上或实际上作出某些让步。
    自今年一月至五月为期四个月的国际关税与贸易总协定第四次会议，就是在这种情况下召开的。会上，美国对于参加关税与贸易总协定的个别大国作了一些让步，但是大多数西欧国家并未能得到他们所期待的结果。会议没有解决它们所面临的困难。
    英国本来企图通过关税与贸易总协定来分享国际贸易中的额外利润。但是，英国并未能如愿以偿。尽管英国与欧洲各低税国家比较起来维持了较高的关税水平，并且由于按照关税与贸易总协定减低了自其他英联邦国家入口的关税优惠待遇，因而得到了某些利益，但是关税与贸易总协定却削弱了帝国优惠制。按国际关税与贸易总协定的规定，当美国及其他竞争者的商品进入英联邦成员国的市场时，同样也得到优惠待遇。英国自帝国优惠制所享受的利益，便处于被瓜分的危险之中。在这种情况下，英国不得不重新审查自己的贸易与关税政策，以对付来自美国方面的竞争。
    西德为了争取欧洲市场上的利益，积极响应美国的策动。在拟议中的“共同市场”中，西德将占统治地位。它以其压倒的经济与技术上的优势，企图在“共同市场”内部摆弄其他各国。由于西德工业的固有基础与战后时期的迅速扩充和新技术的采用，加上较低的工资水平，西德工业产品的成本大大低于其他西欧国家。因此在出口贸易上，其他西欧国家难于与西德竞争。目前，西德不仅已夺回了战争结束时所失去的国外市场，而且夺取了英、法的一部分海外市场。由于贸易上的优势，使西德在支付同盟以内，处于绝对优势的债权人的地位。在这种情况下，统一市场的成立对于像法国、意大利这样一些竞争能力比较薄弱的国家能意味着什么呢？从几年来“煤钢联营”的活动中，这些国家应该能得到很多的启示。
    因此，不论其他西欧国家的统治集团对于西德的经济扩张政策暂时如何容忍，但西德作为一个强大的竞争者重新进入欧洲市场，必然会而且已经使它与其他西欧国家的矛盾尖锐化。
    由西德占统治地位的“共同市场”的建立，意味着英国在欧洲经济地位的削弱。对于这样一个与自身利益密切相关的问题，英国当然不会采取冷淡的态度。
    英国组织西欧“自由贸易区域”的目的，在于自美国和西德方面夺取对于欧洲的经济控制，建立以英国为首的西欧贸易集团，与英联邦和英镑区市场相辅而行。在作法上，英国打算先实行所谓贸易“自由化”，然后在适当时期再进行关税调整。英国企图通过这些步骤把西欧地区的资本吸引到英联邦的轨道上来，以满足英联邦各国对资本的迫切需求。不久前，英国财政部经济次官在下院谈到，“共同市场”的计划不仅应规定有单一的对外关税，而且这一计划还应与资本和劳动的自由流动相联系。他表示，这样的共同市场具有对抗外部竞争的强大能力。
    西欧国家，包括英国在内，在市场和关税利益上受到美国和西德的沉重打击。这种共同处境使英国与多数欧洲国家在贸易与关税问题上产生了某种协调的可能性。
    最近在巴黎举行的欧洲经济合作局部长理事会会议上，英国表明了对于组织西欧“自由贸易区域”的积极愿望。会议在主席麦克米伦的主持下讨论了贸易“自由化”和关税问题。但是在这两个问题上都没有达成最后的协议。与会各国同意把90％贸易“自由化”的规定再搁置十八个月。会议讨论了按一致同意的“欧洲货”自动减税，和建立参加“共同市场”计划的各国与欧洲经济合作局其他成员国之间的贸易和关税联系。在减税问题上，英国表现了拖延的态度。英国的考虑首先在于争取足够的时间，以寻求适当途径来解决由于在欧洲地区减税而可能引起的同帝国优惠制以及同关税与贸易总协定之间的矛盾。其次，英国企图利用低税国家（荷、比、卢、瑞士及斯堪的纳维亚国家）迫切要求降低关税壁垒的愿望，把这些国家拉入到自己的“自由贸易区域”的计划中来。因此，在这些国家同意这一计划之前，英国不会轻易地允诺减税措施。第三，在减税问题本身，英国企图争取对自己单方面有利的解决，即英国仍然比其他低税国家维持较高的关税水平。过去在英国曾一度谈论过西欧地区的“次优惠”安排问题。所谓“次优惠”，是对于“帝国优惠制”而言，其优惠率与优惠范围，均服从于“帝国优惠制”的规定。从英国今天在欧洲的这些活动来看，“次优惠”的安排的精神将会贯注在今后英国对西欧各国的关税政策之中。
    但是，英国或者是其他欧洲低税国家是否能依靠这些办法来增强各自的经济地位呢？今天，这些国家仍然没有完全摆脱对于美国的依附。它们至今还追随美国奉行着武装西德的危险政策。它们仍然担负着沉重的军事义务，巨额的资金被束缚于军火生产之上，或作为直接军费消费了。因此，这些国家的民用工业固定资本革新的速度与生产指数的上涨，都显得缓慢。它们在国外市场上的竞争能力仍然比较软弱。在这种情况之下，“自由贸易区域”的计划并不能帮助英国或任何其他西欧国家摆脱它们所面临的困难。“共同市场”的建立，只会使这些国家在经济上进一步被排挤和奴役。
    西欧国家为了要摆脱它们目前所处的困难的经济地位，便不能放弃国家主权；而是相反，应当加强国家主权。西欧国家，包括像英国、法国、意大利这样的西欧大国在内，都特别需要独立自主的贸易和关税政策，以保护自身的利益并在平等互利的基础上，发展同一切国家的贸易关系。它们应当从根本上改变对西德的现行政策，以防止来自西德方面的威胁，同时摆脱军备负担，将人力与资源转移到和平工业的轨道上来，以提高广大人民的生活水平和出口能力。只有这样，西欧国家才能真正增强自身独立的经济地位。
