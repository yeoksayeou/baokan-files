　　Since the advent of the socialist upsurge, the volume of freight transport in various cities has greatly increased, and the phenomenon of urban transport capacity being incompatible with transport volume has emerged. This phenomenon is becoming more serious day by day with the development of production and construction.

　　Due to insufficient transport capacity, goods to be shipped out cannot be transported to the docks in time; raw materials that have been transported in cannot be delivered to the places where they are needed on schedule. It even causes industrial production and capital construction units to stop work and wait for materials.

　　Increased transport volume is an objective need, and insufficient transport capacity is an objective difficulty. It seems that the solution to the transportation blockage problem must start with increasing transportation equipment. However, increasing transportation equipment cannot be achieved immediately. The main method at present is to tap transportation potential.

　　Several news items published in this newspaper today prove that it is possible to tap a large amount of transportation potential. Wuhan City organized the self-provided freight vehicles of government agencies and enterprises to participate in urban transportation. A preliminary survey of 101 available vehicles in 134 units showed that they can help the transportation department transport about 50,000 tons of goods per month; Shanghai City implemented night transportation, which can transport 7,000 tons more of goods every day. It is estimated that by the fourth quarter, the daily transportation capacity can be increased by 15,000 tons compared with the current level, which can basically change the situation that urban transportation capacity is incompatible with transport volume; Liaoning Province mobilized more than 8,900 rural carts, which transported millions of tons of goods accumulated in various cities to the places where they were needed.

　　There are really many ways! Can't other places learn these methods? For example, government agencies and enterprises in various cities have many self-provided vehicles, which are sometimes idle and sometimes overwhelmed; there are many cases where trucks run empty on the return trip after carrying goods one way. It should also be possible in other regions to organize the freight vehicles of government agencies and enterprises like Wuhan City, uniformly dispatch and allocate them, and organize counter-current circulation transportation. Areas with conditions for implementing night transportation can also imitate Shanghai's method to increase the transportation volume of existing vehicles. As for rural transportation forces, they are the powerful brotherly troops of the national transportation department. Appropriately organizing rural transportation forces and using slack farming time to participate in urban transportation is an effective way to overcome transportation difficulties.

　　In short, as long as you actively use your brains, think of ways, and find a solution, a way out can always be found.

    编后杂感
    自从社会主义高潮出现以来，各地城市的货物运输量大大增加，出现了市内运力和运量不相适应的现象。这种现象正在随着生产、建设的发展，一天比一天严重。
    由于运力不足，调出的商品不能及时运往码头；运来的原料不能按期送到需要的地方。甚至使得工业生产和基本建设单位停工待料。
    运量增加是客观需要，运力不足是客观困难，看来解决运输堵塞问题非从增加运输设备着手不可。但是，增加运输设备不是马上可以做到的，目前主要的办法是挖掘运输潜力。
    今天本报发表的几条消息，证明了大量挖掘运输潜力是可能的。武汉市组织机关企业的自备货运汽车参加市内运输，仅初步调查了一百三十四个单位的一百零一辆可以利用的汽车，每月就可以帮助运输部门运货五万吨左右；上海市实行夜间运输，每天可以多运七千吨货物，预计到第四季度，每天运力可比现在提高一万五千吨，可以基本上改变市内运力和运量不相适应的局面；辽宁省动员了八千九百多辆农村大车，就把积压在各城市的几百万吨货物送到了需要地点。
    办法真是不少啊！这些办法别的地方难道就不能够学习吗？例如各个城市的机关企业都有许多自备车辆，有时闲置，有时忙不过来；单程运货，汽车回来空跑的现象都是不少的。像武汉市这样把机关企业的货运汽车组织起来，统一调度调剂，组织对流循环运输，在其他地区也应该是可以做到的。有条件实行夜间运输的地区，也可以仿照上海的办法，提高现有汽车的运输量。至于农村运输力量，更是国家运输部门的强大的兄弟部队。适当组织农村运输力量，利用农闲时间参加城市运输，是克服运力困难的有效办法。
    总之，只要积极地动脑筋，想办法，出路总是可以找到的。
