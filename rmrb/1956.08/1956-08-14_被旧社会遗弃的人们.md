    Those Abandoned by the Old Society
    Xinhua News Agency Shanghai Collective Writing
    Shanghai, the former "Paris of the Orient," was once the source of all the evils of the old society. At that time, countless innocent people suffered humiliation and devastation here, deprived of even the most basic right to life as a human being. Poisoned by the old society, some were reduced to selling smiles on the streets, others were destitute and begged from door to door; many degenerated into hooligans and gamblers, and many were forced to take desperate risks...
    The people overthrew the rulers of the old society, fundamentally eradicating the foundation of evil, and this group of people abandoned by the old society began a new life. Over the years, the People's Government has educated and reformed them; those who were insulted and harmed have regained their human dignity; those who were habitually idle have also rediscovered the long-forgotten joy of labor.
    More Than 60,000 Vagrants Embark on a New Path
    Now, when you come to Shanghai, you no longer have to worry about being blackmailed, nor do you have to be wary of stones suddenly flying from crowds engaged in brawls; on the streets, you will no longer see "ducktail haircuts and drainpipe trousers" rushing about, or people stubbornly following you, begging for alms...
    These people, who once lived in the dark corners of old Shanghai and were tainted with idleness – hooligans, petty thieves, "A-fei" (young thugs), beggars, and vagrants – have, in recent years, been transformed into people who understand labor, have recovered their inherent goodness, and have begun new lives.
    The Harbin Mansion, once a gathering place for vagrants, has become a melting pot for receiving and reforming them – the Shanghai New People's Vocational Training Center. Now, the sound of labor echoes here. Beside the blazing furnace, young men swing heavy hammers, striking with a clang; dozens of lathes in the machine shop hum incessantly; large trucks carry door and window frames, freshly made in the carpentry shop, to construction sites, where their construction teams are building new factories and residential buildings. The more than 1,300 vagrants taken in by the Vocational Training Center have now become machinists, carpenters, and truck drivers, having built many factories, cinemas, sanatoriums, and schools in Shanghai and elsewhere, and manufactured lathes, farm tools, and complete sets of laundry machines. They earn a monthly salary and live well. Kang Miaogen, formerly a notorious hooligan leader nicknamed "Shanghai A-Kang," who used to have two or three hundred apprentices specializing in gang fights and extortion, and also dominated brothels and trafficked in drugs for profit, has, after several years of reform, learned a good skill through labor and become a fifth-grade drainage worker. He has also taken in more than twenty apprentices, who call him Master Kang. However, what he teaches is no longer extortion and fighting, but the techniques of digging ditches and laying water pipes. When people ask him about his feelings, he always says: "The People's Government has made me a human being. If I had continued to live as I did in the past, I would have either been beaten to death in a fight or poisoned myself by using 'white powder' (heroin)."
    Since liberation, Shanghai has taken in and reformed more than 60,000 vagrants, more than 20,000 of whom have become workers in state-owned farms, and many others have gone to the Northeast, Xinjiang, Gansu, and other places to become teachers, cadres, workers in industrial and mining enterprises, and accountants in agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some have even joined the People's Liberation Army. Shen A-wu, Ge Jinmu, and other nine people, who had long been petty thieves and hooligans, went to Lanzhou this March to support key national construction projects and became porters on construction sites. In a letter of good news recently sent to the Shanghai reform through labor organs, they said that their production team of nine had exceeded its plan every month and was named an advanced production team in the second quarter. Zhao Baoxi, a former vagrant, entered the Shanghai New Life Cotton Mill and became an excellent yarn delivery worker. He joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and recently got married, establishing a happy family. These days, he received a notice from the trade union, inviting him to take a short vacation at West Lake in Hangzhou.
    After Escaping the Fiery Pit
    In old Shanghai, in the evenings, the bustling Sima Road and "Great World" areas were filled with prostitutes. Heavily made up, they roamed the streets and alleys, waiting forlornly for customers under the dim streetlights until very late at night.
    Now, this scene has long disappeared.
    In 1951, the People's Government closed all the brothels in the city. All the homeless and unemployable prostitutes were taken into the Shanghai Women's Labor Re-education Center. Here, the government treated these women, who had suffered devastation and abuse, for sexually transmitted diseases, organized them to study culture, and helped them learn production skills such as knitting gloves, socks, and towels, so that they could become useful members of society. Over the years, this re-education center has reformed more than four thousand prostitutes and clandestine prostitutes. Many of them have already participated in the country's industrial and agricultural construction, and some have married workers, farmers, or staff members, living happy family lives. Now, the re-education center regularly receives a large number of letters from them reporting on their new lives.
    There is a lane called Huile Lane on Sima Road, which used to be a concentration of brothels. The New Huile Lane in front housed twenty-eight famous high-class brothels, and the Old Huile Lane in the back had more than ten lower-class brothels. Now, this murky, dissolute place has completely changed. Many of the old residents still live here, but no one is engaged in the profession of selling smiles anymore.
    The old residents of Huile Lane still clearly remember the tragic story of a prostitute named Kres A-liu here before liberation. This beautiful woman, who could speak several languages, was once very popular and had a constant stream of visitors. Later, she grew old and lost her beauty, contracted a serious illness, and died miserably on the street. After liberation, the fate of another prostitute in Huile Lane, Ke Aijuan, was completely different. After receiving education and technical training at the re-education center, Ke Aijuan became a lathe operator at the state-owned Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 3. After entering the factory, Ke Aijuan worked hard to learn techniques from experienced workers and improved her operations. In May of this year, she was promoted to a fourth-grade technician. A year ago, she married the accountant Tang Qingrong. Her husband cherishes her experiences and is particularly considerate of her.
    Foreign guests visiting Shanghai like to visit this re-education center to see the women learning production techniques, as well as the hospital, club, sports ground, and nursery set up for the children of the women in the center. The complex and meticulous work carried out by the People's Government in Shanghai to eliminate prostitution and the achievements it has already made have aroused the strong interest and praise of foreign guests. G. Fanuli, an Italian botanist visiting China, wrote in the re-education center's guest book: This transformation of "lost women" has great moral value. The work you are doing has become a model for the whole world.
    They Are Also Flowers of the Motherland
    Along the Huangpu River, a row of red houses accommodates more than a thousand children aged seven to eighteen, all of whom are vagrant children and poor orphans tainted by the bad habits of the old society. Here, the People's Government has specially established a children's re-education home for them, where they receive a regular primary school education.
    The children in the re-education home attend four or five classes every day. Children over the age of thirteen also have two hours of labor after classes. Now, they have learned to make sturdy and beautiful small wooden stools, small tables, small wooden horses, and clothes racks. The girls use sewing machines to make very nice children's clothing and adult shirts, and those who do well receive bonuses.
    In the past, these children followed big hooligans, fighting, stealing, and abducting all day long, learning many evil tricks. Now, they have organized science and technology groups, sports teams, brass bands, drama, harmonica, and dance groups according to their own interests, and hold interesting evening parties once or twice a week. The electrically operated flagpole made by the science and technology group was sent to Beijing for exhibition, and recently they have made a slide projector.
    Many children have changed their bad habits. The lively Zhu Daolin is only twelve years old this year. His father used to be a robber, and his sinful life influenced him. At the age of six or seven, he started picking people's pockets on the road. He himself can't remember how many times he was caught and sent to the Public Security Bureau. When he was taken into the children's re-education home last year, Zhu Daolin said despairingly to the teacher: "There is a pile of my materials in the Public Security Bureau, shoot me, let me be reborn and be a very, very good person." The careful teacher sensed his desire for reform from the child's words, and they encouraged and educated him. Now Zhu Daolin can abide by the rules and will help other children study. He is striving to wear a red scarf (Young Pioneer scarf) before going home.
    Zhang Xiaolong, at the age of eleven, was seduced by hooligans and became a pickpocket, running around Suzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other ports. He once sneaked into a bank to steal people's deposits and stole wristwatches and gold pens inserted in pockets many times. Now he is a relatively good student and joined the Young Pioneers before Children's Day this year.
    During this summer vacation, eight children have been admitted to middle school. Yun Zhong, an orphan who doesn't even know who his parents are or his birthday and age, has been admitted to the Shanghai Shinan Middle School. The students of Shinan Middle School warmly welcomed him and came to the re-education home to visit him, asking him what difficulties he needed help with.
    The Shanghai Children's Re-education Home and other children's shelters in Shanghai have taken in more than 5,700 children from 1950 to the present, and now there are no more street children to be seen.
    Over the past six years, the children taken in have grown up. More than 1,300 people have participated in industrial construction, more than 600 people have joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and more than 90 people have gone to the border areas to participate in construction.
    Here, There Is No More Tragic Old Age
    People who have lived in Shanghai may still remember that in the past, every winter when the cold wind was blowing, the gate of Pushan Villa was crowded with many destitute and homeless old people and beggars who were freezing and starving to death. Before they died, these people struggled desperately, crawling step by step to the gate of this charitable organization, fearing that no one would bury them after their death. Before their breathing stopped, the only thin clothes they wore were often stripped off, because this tattered piece of clothing could add a little warmth to someone who still wanted to live through the winter.
    This tragic scene constantly threatened poor, lonely, and helpless old people in the old society, but now, in the new society, they no longer have to wander the streets worrying about their old age. The People's Government has taken them into the Shanghai Nursing Home, where they live a stable life, with the state providing food, clothing, and shelter.
    Now, the nursing home has eight quiet and clean houses accommodating more than two thousand elderly people and disabled people. Those suffering from chronic diseases, tuberculosis, and blindness are accommodated in specialized departments of the nursing home, with specialized clinics providing them with treatment. There is also a recreational room with radios, a small library, and a small shop supplying sweets, pastries, and cigarettes that the elderly people like.
    In the blind department, many of them are street performers who are used to a wandering life. They have come here to live a stable collective life, have not forgotten their own skills, and have passed on their skills to more people, forming a blind national orchestra, which has performed in many factories in Shanghai and has been well received by the workers.
    Recently, the nursing home received fifteen workers who had pulled rickshaws for twenty to forty years. They were poor all their lives in the old society. Although some of them were not yet sixty years old, they had been exhausted by a life of suffering. After the rickshaws were eliminated, they were taken in here and are now reading newspapers, playing chess, and living a quiet life with other old people.

    被旧社会遗弃的人们
    新华社驻上海记者集体采写
    上海，这个过去的“十里洋场”，它曾经是旧社会罪恶的渊薮。那时，千万无辜者在这里受尽了凌辱、摧残，得不到作为一个人的最起码的生活权利。他们在旧社会的毒害下，有的沦落在街头卖笑，有的无依无靠，沿门求乞；许多人堕落为流氓、赌棍，许多人被迫挺而走险……。
    人民推翻了旧社会的统治者，从根本上铲除了罪恶的基础，这一群被旧社会遗弃的人开始了新生。这些年来，人民政府教育、改造了他们，被侮辱被损害的，恢复了人的尊严；游惰成性的，也从劳动中重新获得久已遗忘的愉快。
    六万多游民走上新路
    现在当你来到上海的时候，已经不用担心被人讹诈，也不用提防从啸聚械斗的人群中突然飞来的石头，街头上，你再不会看到“飞机头、小裤管”横冲直撞，或者有人牢钉在你身后硬求布施……。
    这些曾经生活在旧上海的阴暗的角落，染上了游惰习气的人们——流氓、小偷、阿飞、乞丐和流浪汉，这几年已经被改造为懂得劳动、恢复了人的固有的善良性格，开始他们新的生活。
    曾经是游民聚居的哈尔滨大楼，已经成为收容改造他们的熔炉——上海市新人习艺场。现在，这里传出的是劳动的声音。在熊熊的炉火旁边，年轻小伙子抡起大铁锤叮叮当当敲打着；机械车间里的几十部车床不停地轰鸣着；大卡车载着木工车间刚制出的门架和窗架运向建筑工地，那里，他们的建筑工程队正在修建一批新厂房和新住宅。习艺场收容的一千三百多游民现在已成了机器匠、木工和卡车司机，曾经为上海和外地修造过许多处厂房、电影院、疗养所、学校，制造出车床、农具和成套的洗衣机器。他们每月都有工资收入，生活过得很好。原来绰号“上海阿康”的流氓头目康妙根，过去手下有二、三百名徒弟，专门包打群架、敲诈勒索，并且还霸占妓院，贩运毒品取利，经过几年来的改造，他已在劳动中学会了一手好手艺，成为五级的建筑沟漏工，他并且收了二十几个学徒，大家叫他康师傅。但是，他教的已不是讹诈、斗殴，而是挖阴沟、埋水管的技术，当人们问起他的感想时，他总要说：“人民政府使我变成了一个人，如果像过去那样生活下去，我不是在打架中被打死，就是自己吃‘白面’被毒死了。”
    从解放到现在，上海共收容改造了六万多游民，其中两万多人已经成为国营农场的工人，还有很多人到了东北，新疆、甘肃等地当了教师、干部、工矿企业的工人和农业生产合作社的会计。有的还参加了人民解放军。原来长期做小偷和流氓的沈阿五、葛金木等九人，今年三月到兰州去支援国家重点建设，做了建筑工地的搬运工，他们最近给上海教养机关寄来的一封报喜信说，他们九人组成的生产小组，月月都超额完成计划，在第二季度里被评为先进生产小组。过去的流浪汉赵宝喜，进了上海新生棉纺厂，成为一个优秀的送纱工，参加了中国新民主主义青年团，不久前结了婚，建立了美满的家庭。这几天，他接到了工会的通知，请他到杭州西湖去作短期的休养。
    脱离了火坑以后
    旧上海的傍晚，热闹的四马路、“大世界”一带，到处都有娼妓在活动。她们浓妆艳抹，游荡在街头巷尾，很晚很晚，还在幽暗的街灯下凄凉地等待着客人。
    现在，这种情景早已消失了。
    1951年人民政府封闭了全市的妓院。所有无家可归、无法转业的妓女都被收容到上海市妇女劳动教养所里。在这里，政府替这些受尽摧残蹂躏的妇女医治性病，组织她们学习文化，并帮助她们学会织手套、袜子、毛巾等生产技能，使她们成为社会上有用的人。几年来，这个教养所已改造了四千多个妓女和暗娼。她们当中，不少人已经参加了国家的工农业建设，有的已经和工人、农民或职员结了婚，过着幸福的家庭生活。现在，教养所经常收到她们报告自己新生活的大批来信。
    四马路上有一条叫做会乐里的弄堂，过去这里是妓院的集中地。前面的新会乐里开设着二十八家著名的高等妓院，后面的老会乐里有十多家下等妓院，现在这个乌烟瘴气、荒淫糜烂的地方已经完全变了样，住在这里的，有不少还是当年的老居民，但是已经没有一个人再从事卖笑的生涯。
    会乐里的老居民今天还清楚地记得，解放前这里的一个名叫克雷斯阿六的妓女的悲惨故事。这个会说几国语言的美丽的女人，当年曾经红极一时，门庭若市，后来年老色衰了，染上了一身重病，结果惨死在街头。解放后，会乐里另一个妓女柯爱娟的遭遇就完全不同了。柯爱娟经过教养所的教育和技术训练后，成了国营上海益民食品三厂的车床工人。柯爱娟进厂后，努力向老师傅学技术，改进操作，今年五月被提升为四级技工。一年前，她已和会计汤庆荣结了婚。丈夫怜惜她的遭遇，对她分外体贴。
    到上海访问的外国客人们，都喜欢到这个教养所里参观妇女们学习生产技术的情形，参观这里的医院、俱乐部、运动场和为被收容的妇女们的孩子设立的托儿所。人民政府在上海为消灭娼妓而进行的复杂细致的工作和已经获得的成绩，引起了外国客人们的浓厚兴趣和赞扬。来中国访问的意大利的一位植物学家基范里在教养所留言
  中说：这种对“迷途的妇人”的改造，具有很高的道德价值。你们所进行的这项工作已成为全世界的模范。
    他们也是祖国的花朵
    黄浦江边，一排红色的洋房里住着一千多个七岁到十八岁的孩子，他们都是沾染了旧社会不良习气的流浪儿童和贫苦无依的孤儿。在这里人民政府特地为他们举办了一个儿童教养院，使他们受到普通小学的教育。
    教养院里的儿童每天上四、五节课，十三岁以上的孩子，课余还有两小时的劳动。现在，他们已经学会做结实美观的木头小矮凳、小桌子、小木马、衣架。女孩子们用缝纫机缝制了很好看的儿童服装和大人的衬衣，成绩好的还得到了奖励金。
    过去，这些孩子跟着大流氓，成天打架斗殴，偷盗拐骗，学会了很多罪恶的勾当。现在，他们按照自己的兴趣组织了科技小组、球队、铜管乐队、戏剧、口琴、舞蹈小组，每个星期都要举行一、二次有趣的晚会。科技小组制造的电动升降旗杆曾被送到北京去展览，最近他们又制成了幻灯机。
    许多孩子已改掉了过去的坏习惯，活泼的朱道林今年才十二岁，他父亲过去是强盗，罪恶的生活影响了他，六、七岁便在路上摸人家的口袋，被抓送到公安局的次数，连他自己也记不清楚了。去年被收容到儿童教养院来的时候，朱道林绝望地对老师说：“公安局里有一大堆我的材料，枪毙我吧，让我重投个胎，做一个顶顶好的人。”细心的老师从孩子的话里觉察到了他要求改造的愿望，他们鼓励他、教育他，现在朱道林已能遵守纪律，还会帮助别的孩子学习，他正在争取带上红领巾以后再回家。
    章小龙十一岁的时候，就在流氓引诱下，堕落做扒手，跑过苏州、南京、上海等码头，他曾经混到银行去偷人家的存款，也曾多次窃取戴在大人手腕上的手表和插在口袋上的金笔。现在他是一个比较好的学生，今年儿童节前已加入少年先锋队。
    今年暑假里，有八个孩子已考取了中学。连自己的父母是谁，自己的生日年龄都不知道的孤儿恽中已考进了市南中学。市南中学的同学非常欢迎他，特地到教养院来访问他，问他有什么困难需要帮助解决的。
    上海市儿童教养院和上海其他的儿童收容机构，从1950年到现在共收容了五千七百多个儿童，现在街头再也看不到流浪儿童了。
    六年来，收容的儿童已成长了，有一千三百多人参加了工业建设，有六百多人参加了中国人民解放军，有九十多人已到边疆去参加建设。
    这里，不再有悲惨的晚年
    在上海住过的人也许还记得，过去每到冬季寒风凛冽的日子，普善山庄的门前就挤满了许多冻饿得奄奄一息的孤苦老人和乞丐。这些人在临死以前拚命挣扎着，一步一步地爬到这个慈善机关的门前来，生怕死后没有人埋葬他们。他们在呼吸还没有中断的时候，身上仅穿的一件薄衣也往往被人剥下来，因为这一件褴褛的衣服对还想过一个冬天的人可以增加一点温暖。
    这种悲惨的景象，在旧社会时刻都在威胁着贫苦孤独无依无靠的老人，而现在，在新社会里，他们再也不用流浪街头为自己晚年担忧了，人民政府已把他们收容在上海市养老院，度着由国家供养吃穿住的安定的生活。
    现在，养老院有八座安静而清洁的屋子收容着两千多个老人和残废者。患有慢性病的、肺结核病的和双目失明的人都被收容在养老院专门的分部里，有专门的医务所为他们进行治疗。这里，还有装置无线电的文娱室、小型图书馆和供应老人们喜爱的糖果、糕饼和卷烟的小商店。
    在盲人分部，其中许多人是习惯于流浪生活的街头艺人。他们来到这里过着安定的集体生活，并没有忘记自己的擅长，而且把他们的技艺传授给了更多的人，组成了一个盲人国乐队，曾经到上海好多工厂去演奏，得到了工人们的好评。
    最近，养老院来了十五个拉过二十到四十年人力车的工人，他们在旧社会里穷了一辈子，虽然有的人还不到六十岁，却已经被痛苦的生活折磨得精疲力尽，人力车消灭以后，他们被收容到这里，现在正和其他的一些老人们一起，每天读报、下棋，过着安静的日子。
