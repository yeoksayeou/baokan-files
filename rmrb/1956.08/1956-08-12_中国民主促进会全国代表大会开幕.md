Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Second National Congress of the China Association for Promoting Democracy opened in Beijing today. This congress will, based on the requirements of the new situation, review and summarize the work of the past six years, and on the basis of unifying the correct understanding of the major policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," further determine the future direction and tasks of the association.

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said in his opening speech that not long before the opening of this congress, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and the democratic parties. The proposal of this policy is a great encouragement to the democratic parties, and at the same time, it puts forward new requirements and increases the responsibilities of the democratic parties and their members. Ma Xulun said that the congress requires everyone to take responsibility, open their minds, and boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions on the work of the association, the work of their own positions, and the work of the united front, to know everything and say everything, so as not to fail the expectations of the country, the people, and all members on us.

Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, delivered a work report of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy at today's congress. In his report, Zhou Jianren talked about the work achievements of the China Association for Promoting Democracy since the First National Congress convened in April 1950. He said that in order to mobilize all forces to serve socialism, the local organizations of the association have strengthened the work of contacting the masses, reflected many situations and problems, and organized them to study on a voluntary basis. Some local organizations have also conducted more in-depth investigations and research on intellectuals recently. With the development of the work of the association, the organization of the association has also been developed and consolidated. The number of current members has increased more than eighteen times compared with the time of the First National Congress. Now the organization of the association has a national scale.

Zhou Jianren mentioned in his report that the association's work in the past also had serious shortcomings. The main ones are: the leadership lags behind the masses, and the work lags behind reality. Especially after the arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation, the work of the association could not adapt to the increasing objective needs. Due to the existence of right-leaning conservative ideas, the leadership style of the Central Committee of the association has been cautious and timid, lacking specific leadership in the work of local organizations, thereby reducing the influence and role that the association can play. Zhou Jianren also suggested in his report several tasks that the association should implement in the future.

Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, made an explanation on the draft amendment to the Charter of the China Association for Promoting Democracy at the congress.

A total of 272 delegates attended and were present at this congress. Most of them are cultural and educational workers.

This congress will also amend the charter and elect a new central leadership.

Representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, as well as representatives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Education also attended the opening ceremony of the congress. Xu Dixing, representative of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Chen Shutong, representative of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and Zeng Zhaolun, representative of the China Democratic League, spoke or delivered written speeches at the meeting, expressing warm congratulations to the congress.

    中国民主促进会全国代表大会开幕
    新华社11日讯　中国民主促进会第二次全国代表大会今天在北京开幕。这次大会要根据新的形势的要求，来检查和总结六年来的工作，在统一对“长期共存、互相监督”这一重大方针正确认识的基础上，进一步确定今后会的方针和任务。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦在开幕词中说，这次代表大会开幕前不久，中国共产党提出了共产党与各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针。这个方针的提出对于各民主党派是一个巨大的鼓舞，同时也提出了新的要求，加重了各民主党派及其成员的责任。马叙伦说，代表大会要求大家负起责任，敞开思想，对会的工作、对自己岗位的工作、对统一战线工作大胆地提出批评和建议，做到知无不言，言无不尽，以不辜负国家和人民以及全体会员对我们的期望。
    中国民主促进会副主席周建人在今天的大会上作了中国民主促进会第三届中央理事会工作报告。周建人在报告中谈到从1950年4月召开第一次全国代表大会以来中国民主促进会的工作成就。他说，为了调动一切力量为社会主义服务，民进各地组织都加强了联系群众的工作，反映了不少情况和问题，并在自愿基础上组织他们进行学习。有些地方组织，近来还比较深入地进行了关于知识分子的调查研究工作。随着会的工作的发展，会的组织也得到了发展和巩固。现有会员人数比第一次代表大会时增加了十八倍多。现在会的组织已具有全国规模。
    周建人在报告中谈到过去会的工作还有严重的缺点。主要是：领导落后于群众，工作落后于实际。特别在社会主义改造高潮来临之后，民进的工作不能适应日益增长的客观需要。由于右倾保守思想的存在，民进中央的领导作风上存在着谨小慎微、缩手缩脚等缺点，对地方组织的工作缺乏具体领导，从而减低了民进所能发挥的影响和作用。周建人在报告中还向大会建议民进在今后应予贯彻的几项工作。
    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊在大会上作了关于中国民主促进会章程修改草案的说明。
    参加这次大会的出席和列席的代表共有272人。他们大多数是文化教育工作者。
    这次代表大会还要修改会章，选举新的中央领导机构。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国共产党中央统一战线工作部、各民主党派的代表以及中国科学院、文化部、教育部的代表也参加了大会的开幕式。中共中央统战部代表许涤新、政协全国委员会代表陈叔通、中国民主同盟代表曾昭抡在会上讲了话或发表书面讲话，向大会表示热烈祝贺。
