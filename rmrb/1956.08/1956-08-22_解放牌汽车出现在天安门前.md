Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Ten brand-new, dark green domestically produced "Liberation" brand automobiles appeared in Tiananmen Square in Beijing today. These automobiles are part of the first batch of thirty-eight vehicles transported to Beijing from the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

At a little after 4:00 PM, when these automobiles drove into Tiananmen Square, they were quickly surrounded by crowds. An experienced driver, Geng Wenyuan, stroked the smooth fender and said, "For twenty years, I've driven all kinds of cars, but this is the first time I've seen a car with Chinese characters on it."

People from other places who had come to admire Tiananmen Square and the Monument to the People's Heroes were also attracted. A tourist from Shanghai took out his camera and captured these beautiful new cars in his lens. Hu Jige and Deng Peizhi, returned students who had recently come back from the United States, carefully examined every part of the new automobiles. They said that they had heard news abroad about the motherland producing cars, and they were truly happy to see them so soon after returning to the motherland.

These domestically produced automobiles were transported from Changchun to the Nanyuan Railway Station in Beijing at a little after 1:00 PM today. (Attached picture)

    解放牌汽车出现在天安门前
    据新华社21日讯　十辆崭新的深绿色的国产“解放牌”汽车，今天在北京天安门广场上出现。这批汽车是从长春第一汽车制造厂运来北京的首批三十八辆汽车中的一部分。
    下午四点多钟，当这批汽车开进天安门广场的时候，很快就被人群包围了起来。老司机耿文元抚摸着光滑的挡泥板说：“二十年来，我开过各种各样的车，这次可是头一次看到上面有中国字的汽车。”
    外地来瞻仰天安门、人民英雄纪念碑的人们也被吸引来了。一位上海的旅客拿出了照相机，把这些漂亮的新汽车摄入了镜头。从美国归来不久的留学生胡继葛、邓培植仔细地看了新汽车的每一个部分，他们说在国外就知道祖国生产汽车的消息，回到祖国不久就看到了它，真是高兴。
