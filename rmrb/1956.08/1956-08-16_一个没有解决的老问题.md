    An Unresolved Old Problem
    Although local Party newspapers have repeatedly called for reducing the concurrent posts and unnecessary meetings of labor models, this problem has not yet been resolved in some areas.
    Take Li Fenghua, a forestry labor model in Shanxi Province, for example. She is the deputy director of the Houzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiping Township, Fushan County, and also serves as a Party branch committee member, director of the Township Democratic Women's Federation, member of the County Democratic Women's Federation, representative to the Provincial, County, and Township People's Congresses, representative of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, director of the Credit Cooperative, and cadre of the Forestry Management Section, holding no less than ten positions. After the Spring Festival, she attended the Socialist Construction Activists Conference held by the Jinan Special District Democratic Women's Federation. After the meeting, she attended the Shanxi Province Socialist Construction Activists Conference, followed immediately by the Shanxi Province People's Congress. These three meetings alone took up one month and one day of her time. After returning from the province to the county, she also attended the County Forestry Conference and the Party Representatives Conference. Back in the township, she was constantly attending large and small meetings. Others could skip them, but as a labor model, she had to attend every meeting. Due to Li Fenghua's many concurrent positions and frequent attendance at meetings, she had very little time to participate in the cooperative's production. In the past six months, she only worked fifteen labor days. The result was that she missed a lot of work and caused dissatisfaction among the cooperative members.
    If this problem is not resolved, how can labor models play a model role, a bridge role, and a backbone role in production?　　　　Zhou Xueren
      Editor's note: Recently, we have again received
  many letters discussing the problem of too many concurrent posts and too much meeting attendance for agricultural cooperative directors and labor models. This has been an old problem for many years. However, since it has not yet been resolved, it is still a problem that has not become obsolete. Why is this problem so difficult to solve? We hope that leading comrades in areas with similar situations will seriously examine it, find the root cause, and find a solution.

    一个没有解决的老问题
    各地党报虽一再提出减少劳动模范的兼职和不必要的会议，但这个问题在一些地区到现在还没有得到解决。
    拿山西省林业劳动模范李凤花来说，她是浮山县西平乡侯寨农业生产合作社的副主任，又兼任着党支部委员、乡民主妇女联合会主任、县民主妇女联合会委员、省、县、乡人民代表大会代表、供销合作社代表、信用合作社理事、林业管理股干部，大小不下十个职务。她从过了春节以后，就出席了晋南专区民主妇女联合会召开的社会主义建设积极分子大会。会议结束后，接着又出席了山西省社会主义建设积极分子大会，紧接着又参加了山西省人民代表大会。三个会议，就占去了她一个月零一天的时间。由省回县后，还参加了县林业会议、党代表会议。回到乡里，更是大会、小会接连不断。别人不参加可以，但她是劳动模范，会会不能缺席。由于李凤花兼职多，参加的会议多，也就很少有时间参加社的生产。半年来，她只作了十五个劳动日。结果是：误了很多工，还引起社员不满。
    这个问题不解决，让劳动模范怎样在生产中起模范作用、桥梁作用和骨干作用呢？　　　　周学仁
      编者按：我们最近期间又收
  到不少来信，谈到农业社主任和劳动模范兼职太多、出席会议太多的问题。这已经是一个多年以来的老问题了。可是，既然还没有解决，它就还是一个并未过时的问题。这个问题究竟为什么这么难解决？希望有同样情况的地区的领导同志把它认真检查一下，把根源找出来，把解决问题的办法找出来。
