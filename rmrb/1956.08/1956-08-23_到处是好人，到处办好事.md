    Everywhere are Good People, Everywhere Do Good Deeds
    A Photo Provides a Clue, a Wallet Finds its Owner After Traveling a Thousand Miles
    Several months ago, one afternoon, the fleet administrator of the Zhenjiang-Grand Canal passenger liner sent a beautifully crafted wallet lost by a passenger to the office of the director of the passenger transport department of the Zhenjiang Inland River Navigation Bureau. The comrades in the office opened the wallet and found a 600-yuan fixed deposit certificate and 32 yuan in cash.
    Who dropped this wallet? Everyone analyzed it in detail. The fixed deposit certificate had the name Wu Tingyuan filled in as the depositor, and it was stamped with the seal of the ×× County Branch of the People's Bank of China. However, the characters "×× County" were illegible. The wallet also contained more than a dozen cloth coupons, some for military use, some from Shandong Province, and a supply transfer certificate for Wu Tingyuan with the rank of company commander, but without the unit name. In addition, there were seventeen photos of soldiers. As for the notebook stapled to the wallet, it was blank from beginning to end. After searching for a long time, the only clue obtained was that "Comrade Wu Tingyuan is a company commander in the People's Liberation Army, currently living in Shandong Province." But vast Shandong Province, where to find Wu Tingyuan?
    Everyone studied it repeatedly and felt there was no way to proceed. Comrade Wang Peizi, the director of the passenger transport department, suddenly had an idea: these photos were probably given to him by his company comrades. Perhaps Comrade Wu Tingyuan has been demobilized. Why not inquire at the Zhenjiang reception station for demobilized and discharged soldiers? After contacting them by phone, there was no Wu Tingyuan among the recently demobilized revolutionary soldiers. This line of hope also fell through. But everyone was not discouraged and looked in the wallet again. Suddenly, they found that the corner of a photo had the address of the donor, Comrade Li Longde's hometown. This was a valuable clue!
    A letter written to Comrade Li Longde was sent out that day. When Comrade Li Longde wrote back, the comrades in the office were overjoyed and shouted: "We finally found him!" However, Comrade Li Longde only knew the hometown address of Comrade Wu Tingyuan, but did not know his current work location. The problem could not be solved immediately.
    Twenty days later, Comrade Wu Tingyuan received a letter from Li Longde forwarded from his hometown. He was deeply moved by the spirit of the Zhenjiang Inland River Navigation Bureau's passenger transport department's concern for passengers. He wrote back, his words filled with emotion, but because he was too excited, he omitted the address in the letter. What to do? Everyone had to look for clues on the envelope. The envelope was printed with the title "Tenth Detachment of the Shandong Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Team." Shandong Province is so big, where exactly is the Tenth Detachment? The postmark had a place name of three characters of which only "Yellow River" was recognizable. When inquired at the post office, the post office searched for a long time but could not find the place. Finally, in the latest gazetteer under the Shandong Province section, they found "Yellow River Ya". That evening, a letter addressed to Yellow River Ya was sent from Zhenjiang.
    On the morning of July 17th, Comrade Wu Tingyuan's reply arrived. The passenger transport department sent the wallet out in the afternoon. This wallet, after a not-so-short period of three months, finally found its owner.

    Sanatorium for Patients in the Organization
    The Shanghai Municipal Corporation of the China Textile Products Company painted three spacious and bright rooms last September to serve as dormitories for tuberculosis patients. All tuberculosis patients who need to recuperate can apply to live there. Patients there can eat Grade A dishes for only one jiao, and half a pound of milk for eight fen. During the day, they listen to the radio and play cards in the recreation room. In the evening, they sit around on the sundeck telling jokes and stories, and they are in very high spirits. Some people water the potted flowers every day, watching them grow and bloom.
    In less than a year, this sanatorium has accommodated more than twenty patients, half of whom have recovered and started working.　Zhou Weibang
    Thank you for Resurrecting Dead Letters
    I work in the editorial department of the Inner Mongolia Daily in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. My family often writes the address wrong when sending me letters from Shandong. Once, the address on the envelope was "Inner Mongolia Editorial Department," and another time it was "Hohhot Fa Chi Daily." On July 23, I received another letter from my family, with the address on the envelope written as: "Hohhot Fa Chi City Editorial Department." There are three newspapers in Hohhot City, and it is surprising that these letters with unclear addresses could be received. I must thank the postal workers for repeatedly attempting delivery without getting annoyed. Even letters with only the city name and person's name on the envelope were delivered. How much hard work the postal workers must have put in to bring dead letters back to life!　Yin Zhi
    Buying Tickets is Not Difficult at Weixian Station
    Weixian Bus Station of the Weifang Branch of Shandong Provincial Transportation Company is a distribution center for passengers in the Jiaodong and Lunan areas. Every day, seven or eight hundred passengers depart from here by bus. In the past, the order here was not good, and passengers had to wait a long time to buy tickets, and it was not easy to get them. In order to facilitate passengers, Weixian Bus Station implemented a telephone ticket purchase method. In this way, buying tickets is no longer crowded, and the elderly and mothers with children are particularly satisfied. However, some passengers transfer in Weixian and need to take a bus immediately after getting off the train, and telephone ticket purchases cannot solve their problem. The Weixian Bus Station sends people on the 83rd train from Pukou to Qingdao to sell bus tickets. Such a service method makes passengers generally satisfied, and they hope that other bus stations will learn this spirit of wholeheartedly serving passengers.	　Liu Yan

### 到处是好人，到处办好事

    到处是好人，到处办好事
    照片一张得线索，皮夹千里找主人
    几个月前的一个下午，镇（江）运（河）客班轮船的船队管理员，把一个旅客遗失的精美的皮夹送到了镇江内河航运局客运部主任室。室内的几个同志打开了皮夹，发现里面有一张六百元的定期储蓄存单和三十二元现钞。
    这个皮夹是谁丢下的？大家详细地进行了分析。定期储蓄存单上除了存款人姓名填着吴廷元三字以外，还盖有中国人民银行××县支行的图章，可是，偏偏“××县”的字迹一点也看不出来。皮夹里还有十几张布票，一部分是军用的，一部分是山东省的，还有一张填着连长职务的吴廷元的供给转移证，但没有单位名称。另外就是十七张战士的照片，至于钉在皮夹里的笔记本，从头到尾都是空白的。找了半天，得到的一点线索只是“吴廷元同志是解放军的连长，现住在山东省。”可是茫茫山东省，何处去找吴廷元呢？
    大家反复研究了一番，都感到没有办法。客运部主任王培梓同志脑中突然闪过一个念头：这些照片估计是他连队的同志送给他的，可能吴廷元同志已转业下来了，不妨向转业复员军人镇江接送站了解一下。电话联系以后，最近转业的革命军人中并没有吴廷元这个人。这一线希望也落空了。可是大家并不灰心，又在皮夹里找，突然发现有一张照片角落上写着赠送人李龙德同志家乡的地址，这可是个宝贵的线索啊！
    一封写给李龙德同志的信，当天就发出去了。当李龙德同志来信后，办公室里的同志都高兴得叫起来：“到底找着了。”可是，李龙德同志除知道吴廷元同志的家乡地址以外，也不知道他现在的工作地点，问题还是不能马上解决。
    二十天以后，吴廷元同志收到从家乡转去的李龙德的信，他被镇江内河航运局客运部职工关怀旅客的精神深深感动了。他写来了回信，字里行间充满感情，可是因为太激动了，来信中又漏写了地址。怎么办呢？大家只好在信封上找线索。信封上印着“山东省水利工程队第十大队”的衔头，山东省这么大，第十大队究竟在那里呢？邮戳上三个字的地名只认出“黄河”两个字。到邮局查询，邮局查了很久，也找不到这个地方，最后，在一份最新的地名表上山东省栏内查出一个“黄河堐”。当晚，试投黄河堐的信，从镇江发出。
    七月十七日上午，吴廷元同志的复信来了。客运部在下午就将皮夹寄出。这个皮夹，经过三个月不算短的时间，终于找到了主人。

    机关里的病员宿舍
    中国纺织品公司上海市公司去年九月粉刷了三间宽敞明亮的房子，作为肺结核病员的宿舍，凡是需要休养的肺结核病患者，都可以申请去住。在那里的病员只要花一角钱就能吃到甲等菜；花八分钱可以吃到半磅牛奶。他们白天在文娱室里听无线电、打打牌，傍晚围坐在晒台上说笑话，讲故事，精神十分愉快。有的人每天给盆花浇水，看着它长大开花。
    在不到一年的时间里，这个病员宿舍共接纳了二十多个病员，有半数病人身体已经好转，并且开始工作了。　周维邦
    感谢把死信复活
    我在内蒙古呼和浩特市内蒙古日报社编辑部工作。家里从山东给我来信常常把地址写错，有一次，信封上的地址写的是“内蒙编辑部”，另一次写的是“呼和法持日报”。7月23日又收到家里的来信，信皮上写的是：“呼和法持市编辑部”。呼和浩特市共有三个报社，像这些通讯处不明的信居然都能收到，不得不感谢邮递员同志不厌烦地反复试投。甚至连信封上只写市名、人名的信也给投递到了。邮递员为了把死信变活，不知付出了多少辛勤的劳动呵！　阴　之
    潍县车站买票不难
    山东省运输公司潍坊分公司潍县汽车站是胶东、鲁南地区旅客的集散点。每天有七、八百旅客从这里乘车出发。过去这里的秩序不好，旅客买票要等很长的时间，并且还不容易买到。潍县汽车站为了便利旅客，实行了电话购票办法，这样，买票就不拥挤了，老人和带孩子的母亲特别感到满意。但是有些旅客是从潍县转车的，下了火车马上就要乘汽车，电话购票不能解决他们的问题。潍县汽车站就派人随浦口至青岛的第八十三次列车出售汽车票。这样的服务方法使旅客普遍感到满意，希望其他汽车站学习这种热心为旅客服务的精神。	　刘岩
