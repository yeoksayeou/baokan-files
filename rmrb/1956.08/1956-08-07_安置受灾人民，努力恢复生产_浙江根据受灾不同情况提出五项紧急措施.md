(Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 6th) The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee convened an emergency enlarged meeting on the 5th to discuss disaster relief, prevention, and the rapid restoration of production following the typhoon and rainstorm.

During the powerful typhoon and rainstorm that hit Zhejiang Province, 52 counties and 5 cities suffered varying degrees of damage. According to incomplete materials currently reported, more than 1,960 people died, more than 1,200 were injured, and more than 38,000 houses were blown down or damaged. Regarding crops, most of the early rice had been harvested before the typhoon arrived. The mid-season rice was in its maturing period, with a small planting area, estimated to be about 30,000 mu affected, with a yield reduction of about 30%. Ramie suffered damage on 700,000 mu, with losses of about 40% to 50%. Cotton suffered damage on about 130,000 mu, with losses of about 40%. Mulberry orchards and fruit trees suffered significant losses. Thanks to the emergency measures taken by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, relevant provincial departments, and leadership organs at all levels before the typhoon arrived, and their all-out efforts in defense, losses were reduced.

After the typhoon hit, the Provincial People's Committee immediately instructed all localities to carry out emergency rescue operations and save lives. The provincial agriculture, forestry, grain, health, transportation, postal and telecommunications, banking, supply and marketing cooperatives, public security and other departments cooperated with each other and joined the struggle against the typhoon. Most members of the CCP prefectural committees and county committees stayed on the river and sea dikes day and night to direct the flood control struggle. The broad masses of cadres, the people, and the People's Liberation Army troops went all out to block breaches and rescue people. Transport planes dropped more than 13,000 jin of cooked food over YuHang, Xiangshan and other places. After days of rescue, most of the disaster-stricken people have been resettled, and are now working hard to restore production.

The meeting held that although the disaster brought about by the typhoon and rainstorm was serious, the degree of damage varied from place to place. Therefore, all localities should take measures according to different situations. In parts of Zhoushan and Ningbo prefectures and the cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing, which were more seriously affected, the current focus should be on rescue and disaster relief and restoring production. In most parts of Jiaxing Prefecture and parts of JinHua, Wenzhou and other prefectures, which suffered minor losses, efforts should be made to cultivate crops, fully restore production, and strive for a bumper harvest. In areas that have not been hit by the typhoon and are currently experiencing drought, efforts should be made to fight drought and rush planting to strive for a greater bumper harvest. Towns and cities must resume production as soon as possible, restore telecommunications and transportation, and do a good job in material allocation and supply.

The meeting, based on the disaster situation in Zhejiang Province, determined five emergency measures: First, actively mobilize the masses to engage in production for self-relief and do a good job in current relief work: provide emergency treatment to the injured; solve the problem of food and immediate housing for disaster victims; and try to purchase and transport building materials to repair damaged houses. Second, vigorously mobilize the masses to restore production, actively cultivate crops, quickly wash seedlings and apply timely topdressing fertilizer, and rush to plant late-season crops. In addition to transferring a large number of late-maturing crop seeds and fertilizers, and allocating loans, all localities should also find ways to solve specific problems in production according to local conditions. Third, rush to repair seawalls and important river dikes to prevent the recurrence of high tides and typhoons. Fourth, salvage and dry damp grain and various materials; transfer necessary materials to ensure market supply. Fifth, quickly repair roads, bridges, and lines to ensure smooth transportation and telecommunications.

The meeting also decided that the Provincial People's Committee and representatives from all walks of life would form a delegation to visit Zhoushan, Ningbo and other places to express condolences, and will send working groups to help with work in various places.

(Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou) Twelve medical and epidemic prevention teams departed from Hangzhou City today for YuHang, Xiangshan, YinXian and other areas that were severely hit by the typhoon. This is the third batch of medical and epidemic prevention teams organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department and the Logistics Health Department of the Zhejiang Military Region to support disaster areas.

After Zhejiang Province was hit by a typhoon starting on the 2nd, people's lives and property suffered serious losses. In addition to issuing timely instructions, the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department and the Logistics Health Department of the Zhejiang Military Region requested all localities to quickly dispatch medical personnel to disaster areas for rescue and disaster relief, and organized 41 medical and epidemic prevention teams to go to key disaster areas in batches for rescue.

According to statistics from Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Xindeng, more than 260 mobile medical teams have been organized to go deep into disaster areas to conduct medical rescue. The Ningbo Municipal Health Bureau mobilized the city's medical forces, organized 33 emergency stations, and set up a large number of temporary beds, in addition to treating the injured in the city, also treated seriously injured patients from nearby disaster-stricken counties. On the 2nd, Hangzhou City organized 12 emergency rescue teams to rescue 166 injured people and transferred them to hospitals for treatment.

    安置受灾人民，努力恢复生产
    浙江根据受灾不同情况提出五项紧急措施
    本报杭州6日电　浙江省人民委员会于五日召开紧急扩大会议，讨论遭受台风暴雨侵袭后的救灾、防灾和迅速恢复生产工作。
    浙江省这次遭到强大的台风和暴雨侵袭时，有五十二个县、五个市受到不同程度的灾害。根据目前汇报的不完整的材料，有一千九百六十多人死亡，一千二百多人受伤，三万八千多间房子被刮倒或遭到破坏。在农作物方面，早稻已在台风入境前大部分抢收完毕，中稻正在成熟期，种植面积不大，估计大约有三万亩受到损失，减产三成左右。络麻受灾面积有七十万亩，损失约40％到50％。棉花约有十三万亩受到损失，损失在40％左右，桑园果树损失很大。由于浙江省人民委员会、省级各有关机关和各地各级领导机关在台风到达前采取了紧急措施，全力做了防御工作，因而减少了损失。
    台风入境以后，省人民委员会立即布置各地紧急抢险，抢救人命。全省农业、林业、粮食、卫生、交通、邮电、银行、供销合作社，公安等部门互相配合，投入了抗御台风的斗争。大部分中共地委委员、县委委员日夜坚守在江海堤上指挥防汛斗争。广大干部、群众和人民解放军部队都全力以赴，堵口救人。运输飞机在余杭、象山等地上空共投下了一万三千多斤熟食品。经过连日的抢救，受灾人民大部得到安置，现在正努力恢复生产。
    会议认为：这次台风暴雨所带来的灾害虽然严重，但各地受灾程度不一，因此各地应按不同情况采取措施：受灾比较严重的舟山、宁波等专区的部分县和杭州、宁波、绍兴三个市，当前应该抢险救灾，恢复生产；对受到轻微损失的嘉兴专区的大部和金华、温州等专区的部分县，应该努力培育农作物、全力恢复生产，争取丰收；没有受到台风侵袭，目前尚有旱情的地区，应努力抗旱抢种，争取更大丰收。城镇要尽快地全部恢复生产，恢复电讯联络和交通运输，做好物资调拨和供应工作。
    会议根据浙江省的灾害情况，确定五项紧急措施：一、积极发动群众生产自救，并做好当前的救济工作：对受伤者进行急救；解决灾民的口粮和眼前住房问题；设法采购和调运建筑器材，修理损坏房屋。二、大力发动群众恢复生产，积极培育农作物，迅速洗苗和及时追肥，抢种连作晚物；除调运大量后熟作物种籽、肥料：拨放贷款外，各地还要因地制宜地设法解决生产中的具体问题。三、抢修海塘和重要河堤，预防大潮汛和台风再度侵袭。四、抢救和翻晒受潮粮食和各种物资；调运必需物资，保证市场供应。五、迅速修复道路、桥梁和线路，保证交通电讯畅通。
    会议还决定由省人民委员会和各界代表组成慰问团前往舟山、宁波等地进行慰问，并将派出工作组帮助各地进行工作。
    据新华社杭州电　十二个医疗防疫队今天分别从杭州市出发到余杭、象山、鄞县等遭受台风袭击比较严重的地区。这是浙江省卫生厅和浙江军区后勤卫生处组织的第三批支援灾区的医疗防疫队。
    浙江省从二日开始遭受台风袭击后，人民生命财产受到严重损失。浙江省卫生厅和浙江军区后勤卫生处除及时发出指示，要求各地迅速抽调医务力量深入灾区抢险救灾外，并组织了四十一个医疗防疫队，分批到重点受灾地区进行抢救。
    据绍兴、嘉兴、新登三地的统计，已组织了二百六十多个巡回医疗队，深入受灾地区，进行医疗抢救。宁波市卫生局动员全市医务力量，组织了三十三个急救站，筹设了大量的临时病床，除收治本市受伤者外，还收治附近受灾县份的重伤患者。杭州市在二日那天曾组织了十二个急救组，抢救了166个受伤者，分别把他们转送到医院治疗。
