    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Discovers Large Area of Lush Grassland
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The grassland survey team of the Shawan Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps recently discovered a large area of lush grassland in the Usu and Jinghe areas, which can vigorously develop animal husbandry.
    From mid-March to late June, the grassland survey team of the Shawan Reclamation Area conducted a preliminary survey in the Usu and Jinghe areas at the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains. They discovered large areas of lush grassland in Anjihai Da Xiao E Ba Tan, Halamotun, Xialageda, Sikeshu, Maotou Shankou, Jiangjungou and other places. It is estimated that Anjihai Da Xiao E Ba Tan alone has more than one million mu. It is estimated that each of the other Halamotun, Xialageda and other places is enough for at least 100,000 to 200,000 livestock to graze. Most of these grassland areas have normal climates, and there are a large number of winter and summer pastures inside and outside the mountains. After detailed exploration and planning in the future, many pastures can be opened up to vigorously develop animal husbandry. (Production Front News)

    新疆生产建设兵团发现大面积的丰盛草原
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团沙湾垦区草原调查组，最近在乌苏、精河一带，发现了大面积水草丰盛的草原，可以大力发展畜牧业。
    沙湾垦区草原调查组，从三月中旬到六月下旬，在天山北麓乌苏、精河一带进行初步调查，发现在安集海大小恶坝滩、哈拉毛屯、下拉各搭、四棵树、毛头山口、将军沟等地，有大面积水草丰盛的草原，仅安集海大小恶坝滩估计有一百万亩以上。其他哈拉毛屯、下拉各搭等地，每处估计至少够十万至二十万只牲畜放牧。这些草原地区大都气候正常，山内外有大量冬夏草场，将来进行详细勘测规划后，可以开辟很多牧场，大力发展畜牧业。　（生产战线报）
