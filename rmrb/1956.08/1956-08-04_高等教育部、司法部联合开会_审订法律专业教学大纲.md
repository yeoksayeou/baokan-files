    Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Justice jointly convened a meeting from July 20th to August 1st to review and approve the teaching syllabus for law majors. Following the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," the meeting reviewed and approved the teaching syllabi for five courses: "Theory of State and Law," "People's Republic of China State Law," "Civil Law," "Criminal Law," and "Criminal Procedure."

    When discussing the system structure and specific content of each chapter of the teaching syllabus, the meeting unanimously agreed that blind imitation should be avoided when learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Regarding the civil law and criminal law teaching syllabus, the meeting decided to separate the Soviet content and include it in specialized or elective courses for research. Some participants in the criminal procedure discussion believed that criminal procedure should focus on teaching the Chinese part, and the application of Soviet theory should also be taught from the perspective of China's actual situation. Participants in the discussion on the theory of state and law had a debate on whether to focus on teaching China's theory of state and law. After the debate, everyone agreed that China's content should be emphasized, and students should be taught to use these theories to summarize the laws of development of China's state and law to solve China's practical problems.

    Participants also raised many issues and opinions that should be paid attention to in linking theory with practice. The meeting also discussed teaching plans, teaching methods, and the compilation of teaching materials.

    高等教育部、司法部联合开会
    审订法律专业教学大纲
    据新华社2日讯　高等教育部和司法部在七月二十日到八月一日联合召开法律专业教学大纲审订会议，根据“百家争鸣”的方针，审订了“国家与法的理论”、“中华人民共和国国家法”、“民法”、“刑法”和“刑事诉讼”五门课程的教学大纲。
    在讨论到教学大纲的体系结构和各章节具体内容时，会议一致认为在学习苏联先进经验方面应当防止生搬硬套。对民法和刑法教学大纲，会议决定分出其中苏联部分的内容，把它放在专门化或选修课程中去研究。有些参加刑事诉讼讨论的人认为，刑事诉讼应该以讲授中国部分为主，对苏联理论的运用也应从中国实际出发加以讲授。参加国家与法的理论讨论的人对于是否着重讲授中国的关于国家与法的理论问题，发生了争论。经过争论以后，大家认为应该着重讲中国的内容，教导学生运用这些理论，总结中国国家与法的发展规律来解决中国的实际问题。
    参加讨论的人对于理论联系实际还提出不少应注意的问题和见解。会议还讨论了教学计划、教学方法和编写教材等问题。
