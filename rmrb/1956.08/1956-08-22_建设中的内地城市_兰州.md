    Lanzhou, a city in a river valley plain located in the center of the country, is being built at a rapid pace. If you stand on the Gaolan Mountain, 2,000 meters above sea level, and look down at the city, you will see a busy construction scene. The entire city of Lanzhou is like a huge construction site, with red flags flying from building scaffolds in many places. Heavy-duty trucks and horse-drawn carts, loaded with sand, gravel, and various building materials, are constantly heading towards various construction sites. Groups of bulldozers and road rollers are working rumblingly on newly designated factory sites and newly paved roads. Tall cranes are constantly waving their giant arms. All of this shows that Lanzhou has entered a large-scale construction phase.

    Lanzhou has a long history and broad prospects for development. As early as the Western Han Dynasty, Jincheng Commandery was established here. It is a transportation hub in the Northwest and a transportation hub connecting Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang with coastal areas. The city is rich in resources, including not only oil, coal, salt, mirabilite, sulfur, and gypsum, but also various rich metal mineral deposits. Lanzhou is also located on the Yellow River. After the great plan to develop the Yellow River's water resources is realized, 500-ton tugboats will be able to reach Lanzhou. At that time, Lanzhou will become a prosperous water transportation port.

    In order to gradually build Lanzhou into a new type of industrial city, the People's Government began to formulate the city's urban plan and prepare for large-scale industrial construction as early as 1950, and built, renovated, and expanded many factories and mines. Now the number of factories and mines in Lanzhou has increased more than five times compared with before liberation, and the total output value has reached more than 29 times that before liberation. This year, the scale of construction in Lanzhou is even larger, with basic construction investment being five times greater than last year. Many important projects to be built in Lanzhou during the First Five-Year Plan have mostly begun construction. The Lanzhou Refinery, which officially started construction in April this year, is installing oil tanks and underground pipelines. After some workshops are put into production next year, it will be able to refine some of the crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield. China's first modern petroleum machinery manufacturing plant is leveling the factory site, and construction of the factory building will also officially begin soon. The city's only power source, the state-owned Lanzhou Power Plant, has basically completed the second phase of expansion, which more than doubled the original power generation capacity, and is preparing for the third phase of expansion. Thirteen local industries serving large-scale industry are being expanded and renovated. Seven light industrial factories relocated from Shanghai to Lanzhou are also busy preparing for the construction of factory buildings. After the Second Five-Year Plan begins, Lanzhou will not only supply the people of Gansu with more daily necessities, but also provide more means of production to national industrial areas and oil exploration areas. These include large petroleum drilling rigs of more than 3,200 meters and the latest turbine drills, as well as various gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, and other petroleum products. The new Lanzhou will be an industrial city centered on the petroleum industry and machinery manufacturing industry.

    The transportation industry in the Lanzhou area is also developing rapidly. Today, highways extend in all directions, and air transportation has routes to Xi'an, Beijing, and Almaty in the Soviet Union via Urumqi. The scale of railway construction is even more spectacular. Before liberation, Lanzhou did not have a single railway. Now, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway has been opened to traffic, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou trunk lines are under construction. The Lanzhou-Xining section of the artery from Lanzhou to the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai has been surveyed and designed, and construction can begin in the fourth quarter of this year. Currently, railway designers are surveying the railway lines from Lanzhou to Liujiaxia and from Lanzhou through Lintao into Sichuan. With the construction of many railway trunk lines, the large-scale Lanzhou Railway Hub Station has also started construction. After this project is completed, the total volume of goods passing through Lanzhou each year will be more than three times the current volume. At that time, a railway network of nearly 10,000 kilometers will connect North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China into one area with Lanzhou as the center.

    In addition to factories and railway transportation, new construction projects also include schools and hospitals. Since liberation, ten new hospitals have been built in Lanzhou. The largest Lanzhou General Hospital, which was completed in February this year, has now begun to serve patients. Lanzhou University, Lanzhou Medical College, Northwest University for Nationalities, Northwest Normal University, Northwest College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and other universities are building or expanding their campuses. The large-scale Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Petroleum Institute and Railway Institute have also begun construction in Lanzhou. More than a dozen secondary technical schools specializing in training construction talents for the country in industry, agriculture, health, petroleum, railway, etc. are also under construction and actively preparing for construction.

    Along with the development of economic and cultural construction, the population of Lanzhou has increased from 210,000 before liberation to nearly 540,000. Since liberation, a large number of workers and students have come from Shanghai, Jinan, Hankou, Tianjin, and the Northeast. They have enthusiastically joined the ranks of building a new Lanzhou. Now, where they have worked with their hands, rows of neat and tall buildings have appeared. Now the urban area of Lanzhou has expanded more than twice as much as in the past, and the area of new buildings is equal to 80% of the old ones. In order to ensure the construction of the new industrial zone, 33 new roads, totaling 63 kilometers in length, have been newly built since liberation, and 15 new reinforced concrete bridges and stone bridges have been built. Before 1953, Lanzhou only had one Yellow River Bridge. Only three years later, there are now two permanent railway bridges and two semi-permanent highway bridges. In the past, the people of Lanzhou always drank muddy Yellow River water. Now, with the needs of industrial construction, a large-scale tap water factory has begun construction, and the first phase of the project can be completed in 1957.

    The public transportation and cultural and entertainment venues in Lanzhou have also greatly developed. In order to facilitate the work and sightseeing of employees, Lanzhou has increased a large number of buses; suburban passenger trains were also officially opened on August 1. Lanzhou currently has eleven cinemas and theaters, and three cinemas, two theaters, and a large-scale workers' cultural palace will be built this year. Yantan Park and Wuquan Mountain Park will be further renovated. In the future, 27-meter-wide green belts will be built along both banks of the magnificent Yellow River, and the scenery and climate of Lanzhou will be even more attractive! (Attached picture)

    建设中的内地城市——兰州
    新华社记者　解力夫
    兰州，这座居于全国中心位置的河谷平原城市，正在以飞快的速度建设着。你要站在拔海两千公尺的皋兰山上俯瞰市区，就会看到一幅繁忙的建设景象。整个兰州像个庞大的建设工地，许多地方都有红旗飘扬的建筑架。满载着砂石和各种建筑材料的载重卡车和马车，川流不息地驰向各个工地；成群的推土机、压路机正在新划定的厂址上和新铺设的马路上隆隆地工作着。高大的起重机不停地挥舞着巨臂。这一切景象表明：兰州已经进入大规模的建设了。
    兰州有着悠久的历史和广阔的发展前途。远在西汉时就在这里设立了金城郡。它是西北的交通要塞，又是甘肃、青海、新疆联系沿海各地的交通枢纽。城市附近资源丰富，不仅藏有石油、煤、盐、芒硝、硫磺、石膏，而且还有各种丰富的金属矿藏。兰州还凭临黄河，开发黄河水利的伟大计划实现以后，五百吨的拖船就可以开到兰州。那时，兰州又将成为繁荣的水上码头。
    人民政府为了把兰州逐步建设成为一个新型的工业城市，早在1950年就着手制定这个城市的城市规划和进行大工业建设的准备工作，并且新建、改建和扩建了许多厂矿。现在兰州市的厂矿已比解放前增加了五倍多，生产总值已经达到解放前的二十九倍多。今年兰州市的建设规模更大，基本建设投资比去年大五倍。第一个五年计划在兰州兴建的许多项重要工程，大部分都已开始施工。今年四月正式开工兴建的兰州炼油厂，正在安装油罐和地下管道，明年部分车间投入生产后，即可炼制玉门油矿的部分原油。我国第一座现代化的石油机械制造厂，正在平整厂地，不久厂房工程也要正式施工。全市唯一的电源地——国营兰州电厂，去年扩建的比原来发电量大一倍多的第二期工程，已基本完工，并着手准备第三期的扩建。十三个为大工业服务的地方工业正在扩建和改建。由上海迁来兰州的七个轻工业工厂也在忙着筹建厂房。等到第二个五年计划开始以后，兰州市不仅要供给甘肃人民更多的生活用品，而且将有更多的生产资料供给全国工业区和石油探区。其中包括三千二百多公尺的大型石油钻机和最新式的涡轮机钻及各种汽油、柴油、润滑油等石油产品。新的兰州将是以石油工业和机械制造工业等为中心的工业城市。
    兰州地区的交通事业也在迅速地建设着。如今公路四通八达，航空运输有通往西安、北京和经过乌鲁木齐到苏联的阿拉木图等航线。铁路建设的规模更为壮观。解放前兰州没有一条铁路，现在已经通车的有天兰铁路，正在建设的有兰新、包兰两大干线。由兰州通往青海柴达木的大动脉已经完成了兰州—西宁间的定测工作，今年第四季度就可以动工兴建。现在铁路设计人员正在勘测兰州到刘家峡、兰州经临洮进入四川的铁路线。随着许多铁路干线的修筑，规模巨大的兰州铁路枢纽站也在开工兴建了。这一工程完成之后，每年从兰州吞吐的货物总量将为现在的三倍以上。那时，近万公里的铁路网将以兰州为中心，把华北、西北、西南地区连成一片。
    新建工程除工厂、铁路交通外，还有学校、医院。解放后兰州新建了十所医院。今年二月份完工的规模最大的兰州综合医院，现在已经开始为病人服务了。兰州大学、兰州医学院、西北民族学院、西北师范学院、西北畜牧兽医学院等高等学校都在新建或扩建校舍。规模宏大的中国科学院西北分院及石油学院、铁道学院也开始在兰州兴建。十多座专门为国家培养建设人材的工业、农业、卫生、石油、铁路等中等技术学校也正在紧张施工和积极筹建中。
    伴随着经济、文化建设的发展，兰州市的人口已由解放前的二十一万增加到近五十四万了。解放后由上海、济南、汉口、天津和东北等地来了大批的工人和学生。他们怀着满腔的热情参加了建设新兰州的行列。如今在他们双手劳动过的地方，已出现了一排排整齐的高大建筑物。现在兰州的市区比过去扩大了一倍还多，新建房屋面积等于旧有的80％。为了保证新工业区的建设，解放后新拓建了三十三条马路，长达六十三公里，新修的钢筋混疑土桥和石桥共有十五座。1953年前，兰州还只有一座黄河桥，仅仅隔了三年，现在已有两座永久性的铁路桥和两座半永久性的公路桥了。过去，兰州人民一向吃的是混浊的黄河水。现在，随着工业建设的需要，一座规模宏大的自来水工厂已经动工兴建，第一期工程在1957年就可以完工。
    兰州市的公共交通和文化娱乐场所也有了很大的发展。为了便于职工工作和游览，兰州市已经增加了大批公共汽车；市郊的旅客列车也在八月一日正式开放。兰州市现有影、剧院十一个，今年还要建设三个电影院、两个剧院和一座规模宏大的工人文化宫。雁滩和五泉山公园要进一步整修，将来沿着波涛壮观的黄河两岸，还要建设起各二十七公尺宽的绿化地带，那时兰州的风景和气候就更加引人入胜了！（附图片）
