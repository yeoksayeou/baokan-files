    Two Blossoms from the Border Regions
    Zeng Lizhong
    In the fourth and fifth performance evenings held during Music Week, the delegation from Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and the delegation from Inner Mongolia brought two sets of very brilliant programs to the audience in the capital. If the musical arts of these two fraternal nationalities were like two buds waiting to bloom in the past, and therefore did not attract widespread attention, then today, these two flowers have blossomed splendidly!

    The first program of the Yanbian delegation, the chorus "Song of Changbai Mountain" (lyrics by Jin Zhe, music by Zheng Zhenyu), has a refreshing and refined style throughout the entire work. For each different lyrical content, the composer has found appropriate musical language to express it, making the musical image of the whole piece particularly vivid and infectious. The first section sings of the magnificent mountains and rivers of Changbai Mountain and the strong character of the people. The sonorous singing makes you feel involuntarily how lovely the mountains and rivers there are, and how amiable the people there are. And when you hear the second section singing of the scene of liberation: "Ah! The red flag is flying over Changbai Mountain, the song of victory shakes the thousands of miles of plateau...", the momentum is so heroic. The author used richer modulation and variable meter techniques in revealing this image. Although some expressive techniques and individual fragments of melody are obviously somewhat similar to the "Memories of the Past" and "The People of Stalingrad are Advancing" sections of Shostakovich's "Song of the Forests," if this is not a coincidence, I believe that the author can integrate his own musical ideas when borrowing the expressive techniques of these famous fragments, and carry out creative and unique expressions, and it should still be said that it is a more successful attempt.

    The conductor, Piao You, handled this song very well. According to the characteristics of this work, he tried his best to show the content of the song in the Korean style. The conductor tried hard to highlight the national style in the work that was only present as a not-so-obvious factor. This is especially obvious in the female solo part.

    The female solo "Song of the Maiden" is also a very novel and moving program. This song has interlude after each section is sung. The singer, Fang Chushan, appropriately added some dances to express the different emotions contained in the lyrics in these interlude fragments. The movements are so simple, pure, and meaningful that you feel that it is not dance but wings added to the melody. The performer perfectly devoted herself to the music, thus endowing the performance with a layer of musical and poetic artistic conception, and producing a kind of power that grabs people's hearts.

    All the programs of the Inner Mongolia delegation have a very distinct and simple style.

    The male solo by Hazhabu expressed a very moving musical image. From his melodious and vast singing, you can not only imagine the beautiful scenery of the grassland, but also appreciate the brave and emotional character of the Mongolian people.

    The folk song choir adapted by De Boshih and others and the two dance pieces compiled by Ming Tai and Gao Tai are very simple and exquisite in technique, and sound lively and moving.

    The matouqin solo "Hailong" by the old singer Se Laxi was particularly popular. It is even more touching that he came all the way to Beijing to perform such a wonderful program for the audience at such an old age.

    The solo by the young female singer Bao Yinde Lige, although it is an old program sung in 1953, still feels fresh, but there does not seem to be enough new creation in the performance. I wonder if this is due to insufficient help in further improving her artistic expression? When she lived in Beijing last year, I rarely saw any famous artists paying special attention to this point, but only noticed to invite her out when there was a task to go abroad, which is not enough.

    来自边疆的两朵鲜花
    曾理中
    在音乐周举行的第四、第五两次演出晚会上，来自延边的朝鲜族代表团和来自内蒙古的代表团，给首都的听众带来了两套非常精采的节目。如果说，这两个兄弟民族的音乐艺术，在过去像是两枝含苞未放的花，因而未引起人们普遍注意的话；那末，今天，这两枝花已经灿烂地开放出来了！
    延边代表团的第一个节目合唱“长白之歌”（金哲词郑镇玉曲），整个作品都具有一种爽朗洗炼的风格。每段不同的歌词内容，作曲者都找到了恰当的音乐语言来表现，全曲的音乐形象就特别显得鲜明和具有感染力。第一段歌唱长白山的壮丽山河和人民的坚强性格，那种浑厚的歌声，使你情不自禁地感到那里的山河是多么可爱，那里的人民又是多么可亲。而当你听到第二段歌唱解放的情景时：“啊！红旗飘扬在长白山上，胜利的歌声震撼了千里高原……”，气势却又是那样的豪迈。作者在揭示这一形象时，运用了较丰富的转调和变节拍手法。有些表现手法和个别片段的曲调，虽然比较明显的听得出有点类似萧斯塔科维奇的“森林之歌”的“过去的回忆”和“斯大林格勒的人民在前进”两段，如果这不是一种偶合的话，我认为作者能在借镜这些名作片段的表现手法时，融汇了自己的乐想，进行了创造性的独特表现，应该说它仍然是一种比较成功的尝试。
    指挥者朴佑处理这支歌也很出色。他根据这个作品的特点，尽量以朝鲜族的风格来展示歌曲内容。指挥者努力地将作品中某些仅仅还是作为一种不太明显的因素而存在的民族风格突现出来了。特别是在女声独唱部分，这一点更明显。
    女声独唱“闺女之歌”，也是一个非常新颖动人的节目。这支歌在每唱完一段之后，都有间奏。演唱者方初善在这些间奏片段中，按照歌词所涵的不同情绪，适当地加上了一些舞蹈来予以抒发，动作是那么简单纯朴而又意味深长，使你觉得那不是舞蹈而是给旋律安上了翅膀。表演者完美地投进到音乐中，因此给表演赋上了一层音乐和诗的意境，并且产生了一种攫住人心的力量。
    内蒙古代表团的全部节目，有着极鲜明而朴质的风格。
    哈扎布的男声独唱，表现了极动人的音乐形象。从他那悠扬辽阔的歌声里，你不仅可以想象到草原上的美景，而且可以从中体味得出蒙古人民那种作风骁勇而感情却又那么深挚细致的性格。
    德伯希夫等改编的民歌小合唱和明太、高太所编的两支舞曲，手法都很朴素精致，听起来活泼动人。
    老歌手色拉西的马头琴独奏“海龙”，特别受到欢迎，以他那样大的年纪，还远道来京为听众们演出这样精采的节目，更使人感动。
    女青年歌唱家宝音得力格的独唱，虽然是1953年唱过的老节目，但听来仍感到清新，不过在表现上新的创造似乎还不够多。我想，这是否由于对她在艺术表现上进一步的提高帮助得不够所致呢？去年她住在北京的时候，就很少见到有哪位名家特别关心到这一点，而只是一有出国任务才注意到请她出来，这是不够的。
