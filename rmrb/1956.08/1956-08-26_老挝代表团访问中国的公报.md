Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, issued a communiqué on the visit of the Government Delegation of the Kingdom of Laos to China at a press conference this evening. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

	For thousands of years, the Kingdom of Laos (Lan Xang Dynasty) has maintained good relations with its great neighbor, China. It was only at the end of the last century that this relationship was interrupted by foreign rule. Now that the Kingdom of Laos has restored its independence and freedom, it naturally seeks to re-establish traditional friendly ties with the People's Republic of China. Countries may have different political and social systems, but their economic and cultural interdependence, especially between two neighboring countries, remains an eternal truth.
	Furthermore, while Laos in the past has waged wars with certain neighboring countries to safeguard its freedom and independence, it has never suffered any aggression from the great China. Laos and China have always maintained extremely harmonious relations, respecting each other's customs and habits. Therefore, the Government of the Kingdom of Laos gladly accepted the invitation from the Chinese Government to visit its great neighbor.
	The delegation of nearly thirty people, led by His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, departed from Vientiane on August 19th on a special plane of Lao Aviation, and after a brief stop in Hanoi, arrived in Guangzhou on the same day. The delegation stayed in Guangzhou that afternoon and evening, and the next day (August 20th) changed to a special plane prepared by the Chinese government and arrived in Beijing in the evening after lunch in Hankou.
	During the Lao delegation's stay in Beijing, His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State Katay Don Sasorith and Minister of Finance, National Economy and Planning Leuam Insixiengmay, held lengthy and important talks with Premier Zhou Enlai of the Chinese Government, accompanied by his key aides.
	Later, all members of the Lao delegation were received by His Excellency Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China.
	These talks and receptions were filled with the most sincere friendship, and wherever the Lao delegation passed, whether in Guangzhou, Hankou, Beijing, or Shenyang, where it arrived on August 23rd to visit the great industrial city of Northeast China, the delegation received grand, friendly welcomes and warm hospitality from the Chinese people and local authorities.
	On the eve of its departure from Beijing, the Lao delegation issued a joint statement on the talks between the leaders of the two governments. The delegation will return to Vientiane via Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hanoi.

    老挝代表团访问中国的公报
    新华社25日讯　老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王在今晚记者招待会上发表了关于老挝王国政府代表团访问中国的公报。公报全文如下：
    在已有千年的历史中，老挝王国（兰生王朝）一向同它的伟大邻邦——中国保持着良好的联系。只是在前世纪末期，这种关系始由于外国的统治而中断。现在老挝王国已经恢复了它的独立和自由，自然地它要寻求同中华人民共和国重新恢复传统的友谊联系。各国可以有着不同的政治社会制度，但是它们之间的经济和文化的相互依赖，尤其是在两个接壤国家之间，仍是一种永恒的真理。
    此外，如果老挝在过去为了保障自己的自由和独立，曾经同某些邻国进行过战争，但是它从来没有遭受到来自伟大的中国的任何侵略。老挝同中国一直关系极为敦睦，并且互相尊重各自的风俗及习惯。因此，老挝王国政府就欣然地接受了中国政府的邀请，前来访问它的伟大的邻邦。
    由老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王所率领的近三十人的代表团，于八月十九日乘老挝航空公司专机由万象启程，在河内稍事停留后，当日到达广州。代表团当日下午与当晚在广州逗留，次日（八月二十日）改乘中国政府所准备的专机经汉口进午餐后，傍晚抵达北京。
    在老挝代表团逗留北京期间，梭发那·富马亲王殿下在副首相兼国务部长卡代·敦·萨索里特和财政、国家经济和计划部长仑·英锡相迈陪同下和中国政府总理周恩来阁下在其主要助手陪同下曾作了长时间的重要会谈。
    以后，老挝代表团全体团员曾受到中华人民共和国主席毛泽东阁下的接见。
    这些会谈和接待充满了最诚挚的友谊，并且在老挝代表团经过的地方，无论是广州、汉口、北京或是为了参观东北伟大的工业城市而于8月23日到达的沈阳，代表团到处受到中国人民和各地方当局盛大的友好欢迎和热情的款待。
    老挝代表团在离别北京前夕，关于两国政府领袖之间的会谈，已经公布一个联合声明，代表团将经上海、汉口、广州及河内返回万象。
                               1956年8月25日于北京
