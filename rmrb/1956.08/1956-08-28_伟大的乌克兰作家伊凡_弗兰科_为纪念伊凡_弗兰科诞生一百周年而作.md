	"I am a son of the people,
	My motto is: labor, happiness, and freedom!" - Ivan Franko

	August 27th of this year marks the centenary of the birth of the great Ukrainian writer, outstanding social activist, and revolutionary democrat, Ivan Franko. According to the decision of the special meeting of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm on April 9th of this year, Ivan Franko has been listed as one of the world cultural figures to be commemorated this year.

	Ivan Franko is one of the most outstanding classical writers in the history of Ukrainian literature in the 19th and early 20th centuries, following the great poet Shevchenko, and also one of the most beloved writers of the Ukrainian people. His glorious name is forever juxtaposed with those of Taras Shevchenko, Mikhail Kotsiubinsky, Lesya Ukrainka, and others. He inherited and developed the excellent traditions of revolutionary democratic literature. His rich and prolific activities in literary creation, literary criticism, and academic research marked a new era in the history of Ukrainian literature.

	Ivan Franko was also an enthusiastic and sincere revolutionary fighter who closely linked his lifelong literary creation and social activities with the cause of striving for the liberation of the Ukrainian people, the cause of striving for human happiness and freedom, and the cause of friendship and unity among the people of all countries in the world. Neither poverty nor persecution, neither arrest nor imprisonment, could shake or destroy his strong will. He was a loyal son of the Ukrainian people, and he was forever loyal to his people and cause! He once said:

	Poetry and labor - are two great forces!
	I promise to serve them to the end of my life.

	In another place, he wrote:

	I am willing to fight for the cause of justice!
	I am willing to die for it,
	And I want to carry the banner of struggle
	Intact all the way to the grave!

	Now let us look back at the path of life and creation that Ivan Franko walked through for sixty years:

	Ivan Franko was born on August 27, 1856, in the family of a village blacksmith in Galicia, Western Ukraine. Galicia was then under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but the local people lived under the oppression of Polish rulers and landlords. Therefore, from his childhood, Ivan Franko deeply experienced the dual oppression of national and social exploitation, and also personally knew the sad and bitter life of the people of Western Ukraine. When Ivan Franko was studying in primary school, he began to read literary works. The collection of poems "Kobzar" by the great Ukrainian poet Shevchenko had a profound influence on him, and he could almost recite every poem in this collection. He started writing very early, and his earliest poems were published in 1874 in the "Friend" magazine founded by students in Lviv. In 1875, he finished Drohobych Middle School and was admitted to the Department of Philosophy of Lviv University. In 1876, he published his first collection of poems "Ballads and Stories", and the following year he published "Boryslav Short Stories", which were written about the life of oil mine workers in Boryslav. During this period, under the influence of Shevchenko's creation and the ideas of Russian progressive writers such as Herzen and Chernyshevsky, Ivan Franko actively participated in the national and social liberation movement, and gradually formed his own revolutionary democratic worldview.

	In 1877, Ivan Franko and the editorial committee members of "Friend" magazine were arrested for the first time for promoting socialist ideas. Although the sentence was only six weeks, he was imprisoned for more than eight months. After his release, he more actively participated in the revolutionary struggle: he joined the "Workers' Committee" in Lviv, edited the Polish workers' newspaper "Labor Newspaper", co-founded the "Social Friend Magazine" with Pavlik, a famous political commentator and writer in Western Ukraine, lectured on political economy in workers' groups, compiled popular political economy textbooks, and even translated individual chapters of Marx's "Capital" and Engels' "Anti-Dühring". In 1880, Ivan Franko was arrested for the second time and imprisoned for three months. After his release, he struggled against persecution and poverty on the one hand, and engaged in writing and social activities with amazing strength on the other. In 1887, his famous collection of poems "From the Heights and Depths" was published. From this year until 1897, he participated in the editing of the Polish progressive newspaper "Lviv Post". In 1889, Ivan Franko was arrested for the third time for advocating the liberation of Galicia from the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and was imprisoned for two and a half months. Repeated arrests and imprisonments, coupled with the persecution and tracking of the secret police, did not shake his will, but instead strengthened his determination to fight.

	In the 1880s and 1890s, Ivan Franko had become the leading figure in Western Ukrainian literature and social activities. In 1904, he greeted the upcoming 1905 revolution in an article entitled "The Breath of the Russian Spring". Under the inspiration of the 1905 revolution, he wrote the famous long poem "Moses", predicting a bright future for mankind, and in the same year he wrote an article in support of the great writer Gorky, who was imprisoned by the Tsarist government.

	In early 1907, Ivan Franko's health began to deteriorate, and his hands and feet were paralyzed, but in the years that followed, he continued to write and engage in literary history research. He died in Lviv on May 28, 1916, at the age of sixty. The working people of Ukraine buried him in the Lychakiv Cemetery, and now his tombstone is engraved with the image of the "Kamenyar" (The Stonecutter) he praised. This sculpture symbolizes his life of arduous struggle: the Stonecutter uses a hammer to hit the solid rock, to pave a flat road for the happy people of future generations to walk on!

	In terms of literary creation, Ivan Franko's talent was multifaceted and prolific. He was a poet, novelist, playwright, translator, political commentator, literary critic, literary historian, and folklorist. He was also a linguist, historian, and economist. In his more than forty years of creative activity, he wrote nearly five thousand works. To commemorate the centenary of his birth, Ukraine has compiled and printed his twenty-volume collection of works. If all of his works were compiled and printed, it would be at least over a hundred volumes, which also shows the richness of his literary legacy.

	In poetry, Ivan Franko left us collections of poems such as "From the Heights and Depths" (1887), "Withered Leaves" (1896), and "My Emeralds" (1898), as well as the long poem "Moses". The collection of poems "From the Heights and Depths" burns people's hearts with passionate verses, calling on people to rise up and engage in struggle. In Ukrainian literature, this collection of poems is regarded as the most outstanding work after Shevchenko's collection of poems "Kobzar". In prose, Ivan Franko wrote "Boryslav Short Stories" (1877), the novella "Boa Constrictor" (1878), "Boryslav is Laughing" (1881), and the historical novel "Zakhar Berkut" (1882). Through these works, Ivan Franko wrote about the disenfranchised, miserable, and bitter life of the people of Western Ukraine; heavy labor, terrible poverty, the abuse, insult, and contempt of the blood-sucking exploiters towards the oppressed, everywhere were sighs, groans, and tears; but at the same time, he also wrote about their spontaneous passion for light and freedom, and the selfless struggle for national and social liberation. In drama, Ivan Franko wrote more than six multi-act plays and five one-act plays, among which "Stolen Happiness" (1893) is the most famous, and is still a program frequently performed in Soviet theaters to this day. In literary history, he wrote treatises on the literature of Ukraine, Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic. He also did extensive work in introducing foreign literary works.

	Ivan Franko attached great importance to the weapon of literature. He believed that literary works should have a high degree of ideology, tendency, and combat effectiveness. They should awaken people's consciousness and inspire them to fight for a better life. Ivan Franko had an unrelenting struggle against those idealistic, trans-social and trans-class literary theories. He said to the Ukrainian bourgeois nationalists: "I'm sorry, gentlemen! Advocating supra-party literature is just your dream, just your fantasy. In fact, such literature does not exist. … Our only aesthetic law – that is life." In his famous essay "Literature, its Mission and its Most Important Features" (1878), Ivan Franko pointed out that "literature should be realistic," "literature should be national," and "literature should be popular." He believed that "the purpose of literature is to serve the people, so it requires literature to be understood by the people." Ivan Franko also said in another article on literature: "Every advanced writer - whether he is Slavic, German, French, or Scandinavian - should be like a big tree, he should extend his roots as deeply and firmly as possible into the soil of his own familiar nation, absorb as much of its vibrant milk as possible, digest it in his own body, and the trunk and crown should be immersed in the internationalist atmosphere of ideological, scientific, social, aesthetic and moral intentions. Only such a writer can be valuable, he can express and be good at expressing his opinions to the entire educated human race on those major issues that most excite his mind, and at the same time he can choose a form that best suits the writer's national characteristics to express his opinions."

	Ivan Franko also attached great importance to the work of introducing and translating literary works from various countries in the world, believing that this would help develop the literature of his own nation. For this reason, in addition to his creative activities, he also spent a lot of time engaged in translation work. In 1883, he told the female poet Ulyana Kravchenko: "Today, to write a good novel, one has to read the literary works of many other peoples, one needs to have a developed method of expression and possess rich knowledge." He also said: "Translating foreign works, whether literary works or scientific treatises, is an important cultural factor for every nation, it makes it possible for the broad masses of people to understand the works and achievements of human spiritual labor." He believed that translation work is like a "golden bridge," linking the ancient and the present, and making the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of all countries in the world closer.

	Ivan Franko translated the works of Homer, Sophocles, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Shelley, Burns, Schiller, Goethe, Heine, Hugo, Pushkin, Gogol, Chernyshevsky, Mickiewicz, Jan Neruda and many others. The Ukrainian translations of books such as Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex", Goethe's "Faust", Pushkin's "Boris Godunov", Gogol's "Dead Souls", and Chernyshevsky's "What is to be Done?" were all done by him.

	In addition to engaging in literary creation activities, Ivan Franko also dedicated his life to social activities and revolutionary causes, to the cause of striving for the liberation of the Ukrainian people, the friendly unity of the people of all countries in the world, and the cause of striving for a happy and bright future for all mankind. This spirit of dedication to the cause of the people runs through his entire life like a red line. Ivan Franko said in his early poems:

	People, people! I am your brother,
	For you I want to dedicate all my strength,
	I want to use the blood in my heart,
	To wash away your sorrows.

	Ivan Franko was full of infinite confidence in the happy and bright future of mankind, as he pointed out in the poem "Written to Fellow Prisoners":

	Our goal - that is human happiness.

	In his masterpiece "Kamenyar" (The Stonecutter), he also said:

	We all have a belief:
	We want to use our hands to chisel open cliffs and crush boulders,
	We want to use our own blood and flesh to build a strong road,
	When that new day comes,
	Another life is about to come, and the world will change from then on.

	When the Ukrainian people celebrated the 25th anniversary of Ivan Franko's literary and social activities in 1898, he said in his reply: "As a son of a peasant who grew up eating peasant's hard bread, I consider it my duty to dedicate my life's work to these ordinary people!" Looking at the life of Ivan Franko, he has indeed gloriously fulfilled his duty, and the happy and free life he predicted has long been fully realized in the vast land of Ukraine.

	Ivan Franko's glorious name and his immortal works are extraordinarily dear to us Chinese people. Today, we, together with the people of the whole of Ukraine, the people of the whole Soviet Union, and progressive people all over the world, commemorate the centenary of Ivan Franko's birth. We want to strengthen the friendly unity of the people of all countries in the world. We want to fight for the cause of world peace and the happy and bright future of mankind. Let Ivan Franko's passionate verses inspire us to move forward! Ivan Franko's image is glorious and immortal! Let us use his words in "Hymn" to commemorate him.

	Immortal revolutionary -
	His spirit calls on us
	To fight for progress, happiness, freedom,
	He is a glorious and immortal example!…………
	He lives forever, he has not died! (with picture)

    伟大的乌克兰作家伊凡·弗兰科
    为纪念伊凡·弗兰科诞生一百周年而作
    戈宝权
    “我是人民之子，
    我的口号是：劳动，幸福和自由”！——伊凡·弗兰科
    今年的8月27日，是伟大的乌克兰作家、杰出的社会活动家和革命民主主义者伊凡·弗兰科诞生的一百周年。根据世界和平理事会今年4月9日在斯德哥尔摩举行的特别会议的决定，把伊凡·弗兰科列为今年纪念的世界文化名人之一。
    伊凡·弗兰科是十九世纪和二十世纪初叶的乌克兰文学史上，继伟大的诗人谢甫琴科之后而起的一位最杰出的古典作家，也是乌克兰人民最敬爱的作家之一。他的光辉的名字，和塔拉斯·谢甫琴科、米哈伊尔·柯丘宾斯基、莱霞·乌克兰卡等人的名字，永远并列在一起。他继承了和发展了革命民主主义文学的优秀传统。他在文学创作、文艺批评和学术研究等方面的丰富多产的活动，标志出了乌克兰文学史上的一个新的时代。
    伊凡·弗兰科又是一位热情的和真诚的革命战士，他把自己一生的文学创作和社会活动，同争取乌克兰人民的解放事业，同争取人类的幸福自由和全世界各国人民友爱团结的事业，紧紧地联系在一起。无论是穷困和迫害，无论是逮捕和监禁，什么都不能把他的坚强的意志动摇和摧毁。他是乌克兰人民的忠诚的儿子，他永远忠于自己的人民和事业！他曾经这样讲过：
    诗歌和劳动——是两个伟大的力量！
    我答应要一生为它们服务到底。
    在另一处地方，他又写道：
    我情愿为了正义的事业而斗争！
    我情愿为了它而死亡，
    并且要把斗争的旗帜
    完整地一直带到坟墓里去！
    现在让我们在此回顾一下伊凡·弗兰科在六十年当中所走过的生活和创造之路吧：
    伊凡·弗兰科于1856年8月27日，诞生在西乌克兰加里西亚的一个乡村铁匠的家庭里。加里西亚在当时受奥匈帝国的统治，可是当地的人民却是生活在波兰的统治者和地主的压迫之下的。因此伊凡·弗兰科从童年时起，就深深体验到民族的和社会的双重压迫，同时也切身知道西乌克兰人民的悲哀的和辛酸的生活。伊凡·弗兰科在小学读书时，就开始阅读文学作品。乌克兰大诗人谢甫琴科的诗集“琴手”给了他很深的影响，他差不多能背诵出这本诗集的每一首诗。他开始写作的时间也很早，1874年时他最早的诗作就已经发表在里沃夫出版的学生们创办的“朋友”杂志上。1875年他读完德罗高贝奇中学，随即升入里沃夫大学的哲学系。1876年他出版了第一本诗集“歌谣和故事”，第二年又出版了以鲍里斯拉夫油矿工人生活为题材而写成的“鲍里斯拉夫短篇小说集”。就在这个时期当中，在谢甫琴科的创作和赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基等俄国进步作家的思想影响之下，伊凡·弗兰科积极地参加民族和社会解放的运动，并且逐渐形成了自己的革命民主主义的世界观。
    1877年，伊凡·弗兰科和“朋友”杂志的编辑委员们因宣传社会主义思想的罪名第一次被捕，判决虽然只是六个星期，但他在牢狱里却被囚禁了八个多月。出狱之后，他更加积极地参加革命斗争：他加入了里沃夫城的“工人委员会”，编辑波兰文的工人报纸“劳动报”，和西乌克兰著名的政论家及作家巴甫里克合办了“社会之友杂志”，在工人小组中讲授政治经济学，编写了通俗的政治经济学教科书，甚至还翻译了马克思的“资本论”和恩格斯的“反杜林论”的个别章节。1880年伊凡·弗兰科又第二次被捕，共囚禁了三个月。释放之后，他一方面在和迫害及穷困进行斗争，一方面又以惊人的力量从事写作和进行社会活动。1887年他的著名的诗集“高山和低地”出版。从这一年起直到1897年止，他参加了波兰文的进步报纸“里沃夫邮报”的编辑工作。1889年伊凡·弗兰科又因为宣传争取将加里西亚从奥匈帝国统治之下获得解放而第三次被捕，共囚禁了两个半月。接二连三的逮捕和监禁，再加上宪警的迫害和追踪，并没有动摇他的意志，却反而更加增强了他斗争的决心。
    在十九世纪的八十年代和九十年代，伊凡·弗兰科已成为西乌克兰文学和社会活动中的主导人物。1904年时，他曾经在“俄罗斯的春天的气息”一文中迎接了即将来临的1905年革命。在1905年革命的感召之下他写成了著名的长诗“摩西”，预言了人类美好的将来，同一年还写了文章来声援被沙皇政府囚禁着的伟大作家高尔基。
    1907年初，伊凡·弗兰科的健康开始恶化，手脚瘫痪，但此后许多年当中，他还是继续写作和从事文学史的研究工作。1916年5月28日他在里沃夫城逝世，享年六十岁。乌克兰的劳动人民把他埋葬在雷恰科夫墓地，现在他的墓碑上雕刻了一个他所歌颂过的“碎石夫”的形象。这个雕刻象征了他艰苦斗争的一生：碎石夫用铁锤敲打着坚固的山岩，好铺出一
      条平坦的大道来，让后代的幸福的人们从上面走过！
     从文学创作来说，伊凡·弗兰科的才华是多方面的，同时又是多产的。他是位诗人和小说家、剧作家和翻译家、政论家和文艺批评家、文学史家和民俗学者，他又是位语言学家、历史学家和经济学家。在他四十多年的创作活动中，他一共写了将近五千篇作品。为了纪念他的诞生一百周年，乌克兰已编印了他的二十卷的著作集。假如把他的全部作品都编印出来，那至少要在一百卷以上，从此也可以看出他的文学遗产之丰富了。
    在诗歌方面，伊凡·弗兰科留给了我们“高山和低地”（1887年）、“落叶”（1896年）和“我的箴言”（1898年）等诗集以及长诗“摩西”。诗集“高山和低地”，用激情的诗句燃烧着人们的心，号召人们起来从事斗争。在乌克兰文学当中，这本诗集被视为是继谢甫琴科的诗集“琴手”之后的最杰出的作品。在散文方面，伊凡·弗兰科写了“鲍里斯拉夫短篇小说集”（1877年）、中篇小说“巨蟒”（1878年）、“鲍里斯拉夫在笑”（1881年）和历史小说“扎哈尔·别尔库特”（1882年）。通过这些作品，伊凡·弗兰科写出了西乌克兰人民的无权的、悲惨的和辛酸的生活；沉重的劳动、可怕的贫困、喝血的剥削者对被压迫者的虐待、侮辱与蔑视，到处是叹息、呻吟和眼泪；但同时他也写出了他们渴望光明和自由的自发的激情，为了争取民族和社会解放而进行的忘我的斗争。在戏剧方面，伊凡·弗兰科写过六个多幕剧和五个独幕剧，其中以“被窃取的幸福”（1893年）最为有名，一直到现在还是苏联各剧院经常上演的节目。在文学史方面，他写过论乌克兰、俄罗斯、波兰和捷克等国的文学的论著。在介绍外国文学作品方面，他也做了很广泛的工作。
    伊凡·弗兰科非常重视文学这个武器。他认为文学作品应该具有高度的思想性、倾向性和战斗性。它们应该唤醒人们的自觉，鼓舞人们去为了美好的生活而斗争。伊凡·弗兰科曾经和那些唯心主义的超社会和超阶级的文学理论作过无情的斗争，他这样对乌克兰资产阶级的民族主义者们讲道：“对不起，先生们！提倡超党的文学，——这只是你们在做梦，这只是你们的幻想，事实上这样的文学是从不存在的。……我们的唯一的美学法则——这就是生活。”伊凡·弗兰科在他所写的著名的论文“文学，它的使命及其最重要的特点”（1878年）一文中曾指出：“文学应该是现实主义的”，“文学应该是民族的”，“文学应该是人民的”。他认为“文学的目的——是为人民服务，因此就要求文学应为人民所理解”。伊凡·弗兰科在另一篇论文学的文章中又讲道：“每一个先进的作家，——无论他是斯拉夫人、德国人、法国人、还是斯堪的纳维亚人，——他本身应该象一株大树，他要把自己的根，尽可能更深地和更牢固地伸到自己亲切的民族的土壤里去，尽可能更多地吸取它的充满活力的乳汁，把它在自己的身上消化掉，而树干和树梢要沉浸在思想性，以及科学的、社会的、美学的和道德的意向的国际主义气氛当中。只有这样的作家才有可能具有价值，他能向整个有教养的人类，就那些最激动他的心灵的重大问题发表和善于发表自己的意见，同时他能选用一种最适合作家的民族特点的形式，来发表自己的意见。”
    伊凡·弗兰科对介绍和翻译世界各国文学作品的工作也非常重视，认为这会有助于发展自己民族的文学。正因为这样，他在创作活动之外，还化了很多时间来从事翻译工作。1883年他这样告诉女诗人乌里雅娜·克拉甫琴科：“在今天，要写一篇好的小说，一个人就得阅读许多其他国家人民的文学作品，就需要有一种已经发展了的表达方法和据有丰富的知识。”他又这样讲过：“翻译外国作品，无论是文学作品还是科学论著，对于每一个民族都是一个重要的文化因素，它使得广大的人民群众有可能了解人类精神劳动的作品和成就。”他认为翻译工作有如一座“黄金的桥梁”，把古代和今天连结起来，把世界各国人民之间的相互了解和友谊更加紧密起来。
    伊凡·弗兰科翻译过荷马、索福克里斯、但丁、莎士比亚、密尔顿、拜伦、雪莱、彭斯、席勒、哥德、海涅、雨果、普希金、果戈里、车尔尼雪夫斯基、密茨凯维奇、杨·聂鲁达等许多人的作品。像索福克里斯的“奥地普斯王”、哥德的“浮士德”、普希金的“鲍里斯·高都诺夫”、果戈里的“死魂灵”、车尔尼雪夫斯基的“做什么？”等书的乌克兰文译本，就都出自他的手。
    除了从事文学创作活动之外，伊凡·弗兰科还把他的一生都献给了社会活动和革命的事业，献给了争取乌克兰人民解放的事业、世界各国人民的友好团结和争取全人类幸福美好的将来的事业。这种献身于人民的事业的精神，就像一条红线似地贯穿了他整个的一生。伊凡·弗兰科在他早期的诗歌中就讲道：
    人们啊，人们！我是你们的弟兄，
    为了你们我要献出一切力量，
    我要用我心中的鲜血，
    来洗清你们的悲伤。
    伊凡·弗兰科对于人类幸福美好的将来，充满了无限的信心，像他在“写给狱中难友”一诗中就指出：
    我们的目的——这就是人类的幸福。
    在他的名作“碎石夫”一诗中他又讲道：
    我们都怀着一个信念：
    我们要用双手凿开悬崖，粉碎巨石，
    我们要用自己的鲜血和骨肉筑成坚固的大路，
    当那新的一天来临的时候，
    另一种生活即将来到，世界也将从此改观。
    当1898年乌克兰人民庆祝伊凡·弗兰科的文学和社会活动二十五周年时，他在答词中讲道：“作为一个吃农民的硬面包长大了的农民之子，我认为把自己一生的劳动献给这平凡的人民，是我自己的义务！”从伊凡·弗兰科的一生来看，他的确光荣地完成了自己的义务，而且他所预言的幸福和自由的生活，在乌克兰的广阔的土地上也早已完全实现了。
    伊凡·弗兰科的光辉的名字和他的不朽的作品，对于我们中国人民是异常亲切的。今天，我们和全乌克兰的人民、全苏联的人民、全世界的进步人士一同来纪念伊凡·弗兰科的诞生一百周年，我们要加强全世界各国人民的友好团结，我们要为全世界的和平事业和人类幸福美好的未来而斗争。让伊凡·弗兰科充满激情的诗句鼓舞着我们前进！伊凡·弗兰科的形象是光辉不朽的！让我们借用他在“颂歌”中的话来纪念他。
    永生的革命家——
    他的精神号召着我们
    为了进步、幸福、自由而斗争，
    他是光荣不朽的榜样！…………
    他永远活着，他没有死亡！（附图片）
