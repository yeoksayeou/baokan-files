    Little Calf Seedling
    Han Zi
    Three years ago, one evening, I stayed overnight at a farmer's house in Dazhuang. I immediately gained the goodwill of the hostess, who arranged my accommodation as if I were a relative. At that time, there was only a six-year-old boy in her family besides her, and because he was spoiled, he had a girl's name: Little Zhu Yatou. Both mother and son were very beautiful, and what was striking was that they both had a pair of melancholy eyes, which seemed to hide some secret in the dim lamplight. Little Zhu Yatou looked at his mother and then at me as if pleading. The mother sighed softly and called to him:
    "Go, go to Auntie's side and talk to her!"
    Little Zhu Yatou came over, first nestled against me, and then I helped him sit on my lap. We were face to face, enough to talk about everything wholeheartedly. Sure enough, he opened his heart:
    "Our little calf seedling has been sold!" There was an almost imperceptible sigh in his low tone. Then he added: "It was sold so my sister could go to Nanjing to see her eyes. My sister's eyes are going blind!"
    I knew this was common. Before the countryside had completely shaken off poverty, an unexpected illness could force a family to sell their most beloved possessions.
    After a while, Little Zhu Yatou continued to complain:
    "The little calf seedling misses its mother!"
    "How do you know?" I asked.
    "People coming back from the market said so."
    After another while, he almost couldn't hold back his tears and said softly:
    "Its mother misses it too!"
    "How do you know?" I asked.
    "Its mother isn't eating!"
    We couldn't talk about anything else that night. At that time, how much I wanted to buy the little calf seedling back for Little Zhu Yatou.
    Three years later, I couldn't find the original Dazhuang village. The original village had become a green expanse of rice paddies, and rows of new houses were built on the nearby western hillside. The sunny thatched cottages gleamed with golden light. The tallest of these houses was the office of the Xishan Township Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    I couldn't find Little Zhu Yatou in this village either, because he was now a primary school student, and from the day he started school, he was only allowed to be called by his formal name (even by his mother): Zhu Hanming. He hesitated for only a moment after school in the evening before recognizing me and immediately became affectionate with me. He was much more lively, and although he had grown two heads taller, I could see that he was more like a child than before. He wanted to be my guide and take me to see the cooperative's cattle. It seemed that this was a happy and proud task for him. At this moment, I remembered his little calf seedling.
    "Is your little calf seedling here too?" I asked.
    "You'll know when you get there," Zhu Hanming replied triumphantly.
    "There" was on the eastern hillside, a green meadow, with the stream below being the best place for the cattle to drink.
    So many cattle! There were cows lying down happily with their eyes closed, nursing their calves; there were yellow cattle with bulging eyes, raising their heads and watching something; flower cattle swaying their heads lively; water buffalo with black and shiny bellies; little calf seedlings, some scratching themselves with their mothers, some jumping and dancing. I was looking for Zhu Hanming's little calf seedling among them. He looked at me slyly and asked:
    "Have you recognized it?"
    I shook my head. After all, I had never seen their family's little calf seedling. It was only in the unforgettable impression described by Zhu Hanming that I felt I would recognize it.
    "There, over there!" Zhu Hanming waited for a while and finally pointed to the stream excitedly. I saw a strong cow drinking water, followed by a little calf seedling. If my guide hadn't corrected me, I would have mistaken this cow for his treasure. He said:
    "The one in front is it, and the one behind is its little calf seedling. It's become a mother!" Saying this, he became shy for some reason. After a while, he added: "The old cow staring at them both across the river is our family's old cow, it's the grandmother."
    Zhu Hanming and I held hands and ran to the stream like little calf seedlings, jumping and hopping. The cattle on the hillside all watched in the direction we were running, letting out a burst of joyous calls. After we had seen enough of the three generations of cattle, the little guide gave a final explanation:
    "They are all in the same cooperative now. Look how many grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters there are!"

    小牛秧子
    菡子
    三年以前的一个晚上，我在大于庄一个农民的家里借宿。立刻，我取得了女主人的好感，她像招待亲戚似地安排了我的住处。这时她的家中除她而外只有一个六岁的小男孩，由于娇惯，他有一个女孩子的名字：小朱丫头。母子俩都是很秀丽的，引人注意的是他们都有一对忧郁的大眼睛，在幽幽的油灯光下，这样的眼睛似乎隐藏着什么心事。小朱丫头求告般地望望母亲又望望我，母亲轻轻地叹了口气招呼他：
    “去，到阿姨那边去，跟她去谈谈吧！”
    小朱丫头过来了，先偎着我，然后由我扶他坐上了我的膝盖，我们面对面，足以倾心地谈谈一切，果然他打开了心事：
    “我们家小牛秧子卖掉啦！”低低的声调中有微不可辨的叹息。随着他又补充道：“卖了给姐姐上南京瞧眼睛的，姐姐眼睛快瞎啦！”
    我知道这是常有的事，在农村还没有彻底摆脱贫穷之前，一个人的意外的疾病，能迫使家中卖去最心爱的东西。
    过了一会，小朱丫头继续申诉道：
    “小牛秧子想它妈妈呐！”
    “你怎么知道的？”我问。
    “赶集的人回来说的嘛。”
    又过了一会，他几乎忍不住自己的眼泪，轻轻地说：
    “它妈妈也想它呐！”
    “你怎么知道的？”我问。
    “它妈妈不吃饭嘛！”
    这个晚上我们什么也不能再谈。那时我多么想替小朱丫头把小牛秧子买回来。
    过了三年的大于庄，我已经找不到原来的庄子。原来的庄子变成一片绿茸茸的稻田，一排排新的住宅盖在附近的西山坡上，向阳的茅屋泛着金色的光，其中最高大的一座房子是西山乡高级农业生产合作社的办公室。
    我在这个庄上也找不到小朱丫头，因为他现在已经是一个小学生，从上学的那天起他就只准别人（包括他的妈妈在内）叫他的大号：朱汉明。傍晚他放学回来，只犹豫了一下就认出我是谁，并且立刻和我亲昵起来。他活泼多了，虽然长高了两个头，但我看出他比从前更像一个孩子。他要做我的向导带我去看社里的牛，看来这是他快乐而骄傲的差使，这时我想起了他的小牛秧子。
    “你们家的小牛秧子也在吧！”我问。
    “你到了那边就知道了。”朱汉明得意地回答我。
    那边就是东山坡上，一片青青的草地，下面的溪流正是最好的饮牛处。
    多少的牛呵！有幸福地眯着眼睛躺着喂奶的母牛；有鼓着眼睛昂着头观望着什么的黄牛；花牛活泼地幌着脑袋；水牛的肚子黑亮黑亮的；小牛秧子们有的和母亲一起擦痒，有的一跳一蹦地舞蹈。我就在它们里边找朱汉明的小牛秧子。他狡猾地打量着我问：
    “你认出来了么？”
    我摇摇头，究竟我没有看见过他们家的小牛秧子呵，只是在朱汉明所叙述的难忘的印象里，我觉得我会认出它来。
    “哪，在那边！”朱汉明等候了一会，终于喜不自禁地指着溪边对我说。我看见一条正在饮水的壮牛，它的后面跟了一条小牛秧子。要不是我的向导纠正我，我就要把这条小牛当作他的宝贝了。他说：
    “前面的是它，后面的是它的小牛秧子。它做了妈妈啦！”说着，他不知为什么害臊起来。一会，他又补充：“对河盯着它们两个看的是我们家的老牛，它是外婆。”
    我和朱汉明拉着手，像小牛秧子那样一跳一蹦地跑到溪边去，山坡上的牛都注意看着我们奔去的方向，发出一阵欢叫。到我们看够了牛的三代，小向导才作最后的说明：
    “都在一个社里啦。你看多少的爷爷、奶奶、爸爸、妈妈、兄弟姊妹呵！”
