    A Disappointing Accordion
    We finally got approval from the trade union and bought a "Beijing" brand accordion. To our great disappointment, within three days, several keys broke in succession. Two were completely silent, one couldn't produce a sound, and another key was stuck down and wouldn't come back up. When we had to use a "silent" key, we had to immediately change direction and use the pushing method to make it sound. We played the accordion with this particularly "brilliant" technique.
    I don't know how this accordion, labeled as first-class and with a certificate of conformity, left the factory?

    令人扫兴的手风琴
    我们好容易得到工会的批准，买来一架“北京”牌手风琴。扫兴得很，不到三天，连着坏了几个键盘。两个完全哑了，一个拉不出音，还有一个键盘按下去起不来。遇到要用“无声”的键盘时，只好马上转换方向，用推的办法使它发音。我们就是用这种特别“高明”的手法拉手风琴的。
    不知道这架贴着一等品和合格证的手风琴怎样出厂的？
