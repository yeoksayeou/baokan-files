    Happy Big Ditch
    Liu Minwu
    When I returned to the army after my home leave, my comrades all asked me with concern about the situation in my hometown. My hometown? It's in Qiaokou, Wangcheng, Hunan Province, by the Xiang River and the Liulin River, by Qingcao and Tianjing Lakes, and it is now completely different from the past.

    I remember that in the past, farmers used to worry about those low-lying paddy fields during the rainy season. They often watched their nearly ripe rice being submerged by floodwaters, unable to be saved. However, waterlogging was less harmful than flooding. In the past, whenever floods came, the Xiang River burst, and the Liulin River, which flowed into the Xiang River, also swelled. Once the riverbanks on both sides were breached by floods, the villages near Qiaokou would suffer huge disasters, with rice fields flooded, houses collapsed, and livestock washed away. How many families lost their homes and fled everywhere due to the harm of floods.

    This place, which was prone to flooding, was equally susceptible to drought when it didn't rain. Farmers drew water day and night to irrigate their fields, and some high-lying fields could not be irrigated, causing the seedlings to wither. For many years, many farmers sacrificed their lives because of such overwork.

    The Communist Party has come, and happiness has followed. The people have established their own regime, and the farmers have used their own hands to repair and fortify the dikes, block the Liulin River leading to the Xiang River, conquer the disaster of floods, and create unimaginable miracles.

    Now, the abandoned Liulin River dike has rows of planted poplars, and the river is filled with many carp, black carp, and grass carp. The nearby farmers praise this blocked river as the "Happy Big Ditch."

    Due to the blockage of the Liulin River and the reinforcement of the Xiang River dikes, those low-lying fields that yielded little or nothing for nine years out of ten in the past have now become fertile fields with bumper harvests. The state has issued loans to the nearby advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives and installed water pumps. When there is too much rain, the farmers pump the waterlogged water from the fields into the lakes and rivers; when the land is dry, they pump the lake and river water into the fields. When I went home, it hadn't rained for a long time, and the water pumps were working day and night; the members of the agricultural cooperatives that had not yet installed water pumps said enviously, "Water dragons (water pumps) are really good, you see, human power really surpasses the work of nature."

    The rural areas near Qiaokou are not only changing rapidly in appearance, but also the ideological level of the working people there has greatly improved. I visited Ren Rangliang, a farmhand who was very superstitious before liberation, and asked him if he still went to temples to worship gods. He told me that the facts of the past few years had taught him that relying on heaven and gods was not good, and that following the Communist Party and working actively would bring unlimited happiness.

    When dusk comes, the breeze brings the fragrance of nearly ripe rice, children return from school with their schoolbags on their backs, jumping and bounding; old people lead their oxen back from the green grasslands; young men and women carry their farm tools back from the fields. The newly erected signs for building roads and digging canals extend from near to far, and construction will begin after the autumn harvest. My hometown, the place where I grew up, will become so beautiful!

    幸福大沟
    刘敏吾
    当我请假探家回到部队的时候，同志们见了我都关切地问起我的家乡的情况。我的家乡吗？那在湘水、柳林江之滨，青草、天井湖之畔的湖南省望城乔口，现在真是和过去完全不同了。
    记得在过去，一到雨季，农民就对着那些低洼的稻田发愁。他们常常眼看着快成熟的稻子，被渍水淹盖了，无法拯救。然而渍水比起洪水的危害还要小一些。过去每当洪汛到来的时候，湘水暴发，通向湘水的柳林江也跟着涨水。一旦两岸的河堤被洪水冲溃了，乔口附近的村庄就要遭受巨大的灾害，稻田被淹没，房屋被冲塌，牲畜被冲走。多少人家呵，由于洪水的危害，失去了自己的家园，到处逃荒。
    这容易遭受水灾的地方，不下雨，旱灾同样可怕。农民白天黑夜车水灌田，有的高田得不到灌溉，禾苗枯萎了。多少年来，许多农民就因为这样操劳过度，葬送了生命。
    共产党来了，幸福也跟着来了。人民建立了自己的政权，农民用自己的双手，修固了堤防，堵塞了通向湘江的柳林江，征服了洪水的灾害，创造了想像不到的奇迹。
    现在废弛了的柳林江河堤，栽了一行行的杨柳，江里养了许多鲤鱼、青鱼、草鱼。附近农民夸誉这条堵塞了的河为“幸福大沟”。
    由于柳林江的堵塞和湘水河堤的加固，过去那些十年九不收的低田，现在成了丰收的良田。国家给附近的高级农业生产合作社发了贷款，装上了抽水机，雨水多了，农民就把田里的渍水抽到湖里和河里去；土地干涸了，就把湖水、河水抽进田里来。我回家的时候，天久不雨，抽水机日夜不停地工作着；那些还没有安装抽水机的农业合作社的社员羡慕地说：“还是水龙（抽水机）好，你看真是人力胜天工。”
    乔口附近的农村，不仅在外貌上日新月异，那儿劳动人民的思想水平也有了很大的提高。我访问过一个在解放前迷信很深的雇农任让亮，问他现在还去庙里敬神不去。他告诉我，这几年来的事实教育了他，靠天靠神没有好处，跟着共产党走，积极劳动，幸福无限。
    黄昏来到的时候，微风送来快要成熟的稻谷香味，孩子们背着书包，跳跳蹦蹦地从学校回来了；老年人牵着黄牛，从青草坪回来了；青年男女荷着农具，从田野回来了。新插下的修建公路、开凿水渠的标志，从近处伸向远方，秋收后就要开始动工了。我的家乡，这生长我的地方，将要变得多么美丽呵！
