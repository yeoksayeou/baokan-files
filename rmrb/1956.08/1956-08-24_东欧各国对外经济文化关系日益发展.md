Eastern European Countries' External Economic and Cultural Relations are Increasingly Developing

　　Exporting Machines to Sixty Countries

　　Czechoslovakia's foreign trade is developing rapidly. In 1955, its trade with capitalist countries increased by 37%; trade with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America increased by 54%.

　　Various machines and equipment now account for nearly half of Czechoslovakia's exports. It is now one of the five countries in the world that export the most metal cutting machine tools. Its machine industry products are exported to sixty countries, and its world-famous "Jawa" motorcycles are sold to 110 countries. One-sixth of the world's sugar factories have all or most of their equipment supplied by Czechoslovakia.

　　Going to South America to Perform

　　A song and dance troupe composed of Slovak youth artists recently traveled from Czechoslovakia to South America for a performance tour. They plan to perform in Uruguay for two weeks, stay in Chile for ten days, visit Argentina for two weeks, and perform in Brazil for a month. On their way back, they will also visit Genoa, Milan, and Venice in Italy.

　　In addition, ballet dancers from the Prague National Theater have accepted an invitation to visit the United Kingdom. They will travel to London in September this year, and the program includes Dvořák's Slovak Dances and ballet from Smetana's opera "The Bartered Bride."

　　Trading with Seventy Countries

　　Romania is trading with seventy countries this year, compared to only thirty-four countries in 1950.

　　Romania's trade volume with capitalist countries is constantly increasing. In 1955, its trade volume with France increased to more than twenty-two times that of 1950, its trade volume with Egypt increased to nearly nine times, and its trade volume with the United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Finland and other countries increased to more than three and a half to seven times.

　　The structure of Romania's foreign trade has undergone tremendous changes in the era of the people's regime. This year, its exports of machinery and equipment have increased to about twice that of 1952. At present, Romania's industrial products exported to foreign countries include: complete sets of petroleum equipment, machine tools, tractors, seagoing vessels, electrical equipment, petroleum and chemical products, building materials, etc.

　　Building Bridges for the Nile

　　Hungary is building seven bridges for the Nile River in Egypt that can be used by trains and cars. Two of them have already been shipped to Egypt, and the other five are being manufactured in the "William Pick" carriage and machine factory in Győr on the Danube. It is expected that one of them will be completed by August 1957.

　　In Egypt's bidding for these bridges, companies from sixteen capitalist countries submitted bids, but as a result, Egypt adopted the plan designed by Hungary. Since these bridges are to be made into components and then transported to Egypt, the design must take into account the strength of the bridge itself, and at the same time try to make them light in order to reduce the load on transport ships. As a result of the Hungarian engineers' design, the weight of the bridge, which is nearly two thousand seven hundred feet long, was reduced by 25% without reducing its strength.

　　Establishment of Foreign Art Exchange Agency

　　Romania recently established a new agency specifically responsible for foreign art exchanges—the Romanian Art Performance and Touring Bureau. This institution will invite and receive famous artists and art groups from various countries to perform in various parts of Romania. They include band conductors, instrumental performers, opera and light music singers, symphony orchestras and jazz bands, dancers, folk song and dance troupes, etc. On the other hand, this institution will also organize domestic artists and art groups to perform abroad.

　　The institution has now established contacts with relevant units in France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, Argentina, Italy, Australia, Iceland, Japan and other countries. In the 1956-1957 theater season, the Romanian public will have the opportunity to appreciate the performances of artists from Western Europe, North and South America, and Romanian artists will also go to some countries to perform.

　　Extensive Exchange of Travelers

　　The exchange of travelers between Poland and foreign countries is developing more and more. Recently, travelers from many countries in Europe and elsewhere have traveled to Poland, and at the same time, many Polish travelers have traveled abroad.

　　Travelers from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States, France, and Canada have all been to Poland. This year, two groups of Polish travelers have visited Yugoslavia and Italy. In addition, more people will travel to the Soviet Union, Eastern European People's Democratic Countries, France, Italy, Sweden, and Norway.

    东欧各国对外经济文化关系日益发展
    向六十个国家输出机器
    捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易迅速发展。1955年它同资本主义国家的贸易增加了37％；和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的贸易增加了54％。
    在捷克斯洛伐克的出口物中，各种机器和装备已近占到一半。现在它是世界上出口金属切削机床最多的五个国家之一。它的机器工业产品的输出对象包括六十个国家，而它的驰名世界的“雅瓦”牌机器脚踏车更行销到一百一十个国家。全世界有六分之一的制糖厂的全部或大部分设备是由捷克斯洛伐克供给的。
    到南美洲去演出
    一个由斯洛伐克青年艺术家组成的歌舞团最近由捷克斯洛伐克前往南美洲作访问演出。它们计划在乌拉圭演出两周，在智利逗留十天，在阿根廷访问两周，在巴西演出一个月。在回来的途中，他们还将访问意大利的热那亚、米兰和威尼斯。
    另外，布拉格国家剧院的芭蕾舞演员已接受访问英国的邀请。他们将在今年九月间前往伦敦，演出的计划中包括德沃夏克的斯洛伐克舞和斯麦塔纳歌剧“被出卖的新嫁娘”中的芭蕾舞。同七十个国家进行贸易
    罗马尼亚今年同七十个国家进行贸易，而1950年时它只同三十四个国家有贸易关系。
    罗马尼亚同资本主义国家的贸易额不断增加。1955年它同法国的贸易额增加到1950年的二十二倍以上，同埃及的贸易额增加到将近九倍，同英国、西德、意大利、荷兰、土耳其、芬兰等国的贸易额增加到三倍半到七倍以上。
    罗马尼亚对外贸易的结构在人民政权年代中发生了巨大的变化。今年，它向国外输出的机器设备增加到了1952年的两倍左右。现在，罗马尼亚向国外输出的工业品包括：全套石油设备、工作母机、拖拉机、航海船只、电气设备、石油和化学产品、建筑材料等。
    为尼罗河造桥
    匈牙利正在为埃及的尼罗河建造七座可以通行火车和汽车的桥梁，现在其中两座已经运到埃及，其他五座正在多瑙河畔久尔城的“威廉·皮克”车厢与机器工厂中制造。预计其中一座在1957年8月间即可完工。
    在埃及对这些桥梁的招标中，曾有十六个资本主义国家的企业投标，但结果埃及采纳了匈牙利设计的计划。由于这些桥梁都要制成构件以后运往埃及，因此设计时既要考虑到桥梁本身的牢固，同时也要尽力使它们轻便，以便减少运输船只的负荷。匈牙利工程师设计的结果，使长近二千七百英尺的桥梁的重量减轻了25％，而不减其牢固性。
    成立对外艺术交流机构
    罗马尼亚最近新成立了一个专门负责对外艺术交流的机构——罗马尼亚艺术演出和巡回局。这个机构将邀请和接待各国著名艺术家和艺术团体前来罗马尼亚各地演出，他们包括乐队指挥、器乐演奏家、歌剧和轻音乐演唱家、交响乐队和爵士乐队、舞蹈家、民间歌舞团等。另一方面，这个机构也将组织本国的艺术家和艺术团体去外国演出。
    现在这个机构已经同法国、比利时、英国、美国、阿根廷、意大利、澳大利亚、冰岛、日本等国的有关单位建立了联系。在1956—1957年的戏剧季节里，罗马尼亚的公众将有机会欣赏到西欧和南北美洲各国艺术家的表演，同时罗马尼亚艺术家也将到一些国家去演出。
    广泛交换旅行家
    波兰和外国之间交换旅行家的活动正在日益开展。最近欧洲和其他地方的许多国家的旅行家都到波兰去旅行，同时波兰也有许多旅行家到国外去旅行。
    苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、德意志联邦共和国、美国、法国和加拿大的旅行家都曾到过波兰，今年有两批波兰旅行家已访问南斯拉夫和意大利。此外，还有更多的人将到苏联、东欧各人民民主国家、法国、意大利、瑞典和挪威等国去旅行。
