"The Weakness of Force"
Excerpt from the British weekly "New Statesman and Nation," August 11
Author: George Wigg
Editor's Note: Although the Western countries' attempts to use military threats against Egypt have been thwarted, there are still those who want to use this threat to force Egypt to accept the "international management" of the Suez Canal, which infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty. However, apart from the ravings of some people who are blinded by the outdated "gunboat policy," there are still some relatively clear-headed and self-aware voices in Britain.

"Immediately! Send troops to defeat Nasser." This was a demand made by a prominent Conservative Member of Parliament a week ago. Leaving aside the ineffectiveness of such a demand as a long-term policy action, the question arises: is it possible?

Let us accurately state the strength that Britain can now put on the battlefield. First, let's talk about the army. For some time, the War Office has been facing increasing difficulties in finding infantry reinforcements for overseas garrisons. In June, "The Times" reported that the 21st and 50th Medium Regiments of the Royal Artillery and the 15th and 43rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments had been ordered to prepare to deal with emergencies as infantry battalions. "The Times" said: "The fact that these four artillery regiments have to prepare to undertake internal security tasks overseas, as if they were infantry battalions, shows how eager the army is to find infantry troops, because many infantry troops are involved in Cyprus, Malaya, and other places. The army is actually lacking in infantry." Note that this was the situation even before the threat of war.

The situation in the Royal Air Force is even worse. There are no swept-wing fighter squadrons in the Middle East – a fact that the government has not denied. We have about a thousand Hunter aircraft, of which about four hundred are now assigned to twenty-five first-line squadrons. If we do not call Israel a fighter base – and it is almost impossible for the Israelis to give us convenience, because they know that the Egyptians can immediately bomb their cities – the only alternative place is Cyprus. Therefore, the Hunter aircraft must fly three hundred miles from the airport to fight, and undoubtedly must carry extra fuel. Even so, they can only stay over Egypt for a short time.

The opponents they will encounter are not outdated aircraft but MiG-15s, which are among the best aircraft in the world. If the aircraft delivered to Egypt are new, then they will be unmatched by the Hunter aircraft under the control of average pilots. Therefore, if the Hunter aircraft are forced to take off from Cyprus, the task of establishing air superiority will be extremely uncertain.

Some may say that aircraft taking off from aircraft carriers can provide sufficient cover. Unfortunately, our naval aircraft are outdated goods such as "Vampire" and "Meteor," which constitute our current air power in the Middle East. The Navy's "Sea Hawk" aircraft can probably cope with the forty Ilyushin Il-28 bombers that Egypt bought from Russia, but they are no match for the MiG-15s.

The Conservative Member of Parliament who advocates that we should defeat Nasser is probably thinking of a war conducted by airborne troops – in which the parachute brigade in Cyprus will seize Egyptian airports and establish contact with amphibious forces. However, this hope is not encouraging. Despite the loans given to the Royal Air Force by civilian airlines, our transport aircraft are too small and too few. If they encounter MiG-15 aircraft, what will happen is simply unimaginable. An alternative to basing combat in Cyprus would be a ground offensive from Libya. This offensive cannot be realized in the short term, because the troops constituting the 10th Armored Division are too few and too scattered, and cannot conduct this kind of combat activity for several months.

It is necessary to face this conclusion: the threat of war immediately makes countries face painful realities. And the real situation we face is that, despite the enormous sums of money spent since 1951, re-conquering Egypt may be a long-term and certainly a very costly undertaking. Sir Eden should think at this time that those who start wars rarely avoid downfall in the end.

    “武力的弱点”
    摘自8月11日英国“新政治家与民族”周刊

    编者按：尽管西方国家对埃及实行武力威胁的企图已经遭到了打击，但依然还有人想用这种威胁来强迫埃及接受侵犯埃及主权的“国际管理”苏彝士运河的办法。不过，除了被过时的“炮舰政策”冲昏了头脑的一些人的狂言乱语以外，在英国也还是有一些较为清醒和有自知之明的言论。
    “马上！派军队去打垮纳赛尔。”这是一个著名的保守党议员在一星期前提出的要求。且不谈这种要求作为一种长期的政策行动的无效性，就发生了这样的问题：这是可能的吗？
    让我们确切地叙述一下英国现在能够投在战场上的力量。首先来谈谈陆军。若干时候以来陆军部在为海外驻军找步兵增援部队方面一直面临着愈来愈大的困难。6月里“泰晤士报”报道，皇家炮兵第二十一和第五十中型团以及第十五和第四十三轻反飞机团已奉命准备好作为步兵营应付紧急情况。“泰晤士报”说：“这四个炮兵团竟然要准备好在海外担任内部安全任务，就像他们是步兵营似的，这表明陆军是多么急于要找步兵部队，因为许多步兵部队都被牵涉在塞浦路斯、马来亚和其他地方了。陆军实际上缺乏步兵。”注意，这是我们甚至在没有战争威胁以前的情况。
    皇家空军的情况甚至更为糟糕。在中东没有一个中队的掠翼战斗机——这是政府没有否认的一个事实。我们有大约一千架猎人式飞机，到现在为止其中约有四百架编入二十五个第一线中队。如果我们不称以色列是一个战斗机基地——以色列人也差不多不可能给我们方便，因为他们知道埃及人可以立即轰炸他们的城市——唯一的替代地方就只有塞浦路斯了。因此猎人式机必须从机场飞行三百英里去作战，并且无疑一定得额外多带燃料。即使如此，它们也只能在埃及上空停留一段很短的时间。
    它们将遇到的对手不是陈旧的飞机而是米格十五式机，这是世界上最好的飞机之一。如果运给埃及的那些飞机是新式的，那末它们在一般水准的驾驶员的控制下将非猎人式机所能匹敌，因此，如果猎人式机被迫从塞浦路斯出动的话，建立空中优势的任务将是一种极端没有把握的事。
    可能有人要说，从航空母舰上起飞的飞机可以提供充分的掩护。不幸我们的海军飞机是像“吸血鬼式”和“流星式”这类陈旧的货色，这类飞机构成我们目前在中东的空军力量。海军的“海鹰式”飞机大概能够应付埃及从俄国买来的四十架伊柳辛二十八式轰炸机，但是它们不是米格十五式的对手。
    主张我们应当打垮纳赛尔的保守党议员大概想着一种由空运部队来进行的战争——在这种战斗中，在塞浦路斯的伞兵旅将夺取埃及的机场，并同两栖部队建立联系。但是，这种希望却不是令人鼓舞的。尽管有民用航空公司给予皇家空军的贷款，我们的运输机还是太小而且太少。如果它们碰到了米格十五式飞机会发生些什么情况，那是简直不堪设想的。对于以塞浦路斯为基地的战斗的替代办法，就是由利比亚进行地面进攻。这种进攻在短期内不能实现，因为构成第十装甲师的部队太少而且分散得太开，在几个月内不能进行这种战斗活动。
    必须面对这种结论：战争的威胁立即使各国起来对付痛苦的现实。而我们所面临的真实情况是，尽管自从1951年以来花费了极为巨大的款项，然而重新征服埃及可能是一种长期的、而且一定是一种非常耗费的工作。艾登爵士在这个时候应当想到，那些发动战争的人最后很少不垮台的。
