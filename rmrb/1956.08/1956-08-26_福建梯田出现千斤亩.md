Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 23rd: The Shihou Village production team of the Xiantou Agricultural Cooperative in Hua’an County, Fujian Province, harvested an average yield of 1,055 jin per mu from 5.2 mu of paddy fields and terraced fields planted with early rice. Another production team achieved an average yield of 1,061 jin per mu from 1.27 mu of terraced fields. This is the highest early rice yield record in the mountainous areas of Fujian.

The other 20-plus mu of rice fields in the Shihou Village production team also yielded an average of over 900 jin of dried grain per mu.

During the harvest period, the leading organs of Hua'an County sent cadres to Xiantou Cooperative for on-site investigation. After drying, winnowing, weighing, and measuring the land plot by plot, they confirmed that the aforementioned high-yield record was completely accurate.

The high yield of the mountain and terraced fields of Xiantou Cooperative is mainly attributed to the improvement of the soil, the use of improved varieties, the improvement of rice transplanting techniques, and the strengthening of field management.

    福建梯田出现千斤亩
    新华社福州23日电　福建省华安县仙都农业社市后村生产队在五亩二分山田和梯田上栽的早稻，平均每亩产量达到一千零五十五斤；另一个生产队的一亩二分七厘梯田平均每亩产量一千零六十一斤。这是福建山区的最高早稻丰产纪录。
    市后村生产队的另外二十多亩稻子，平均每亩也收干谷九百多斤。
    在收割期间，华安县的领导机关曾派干部到仙都社实地调查，经过晒干、扬净过秤和逐丘丈量了土地，证实上述丰产纪录完全真实。
    仙都社的山田和梯田能够高额丰产主要是改良了土壤，采用了良种，改进了插秧技术，并且加强了田间管理。
