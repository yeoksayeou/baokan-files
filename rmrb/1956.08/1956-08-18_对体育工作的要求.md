The convocation of the National Sports Work Conference is timely. Sports work is still a new undertaking in our country. The achievements made in sports so far are far from meeting the needs of national defense and economic construction. Moreover, the rapid development of sports has also brought many noteworthy problems. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to summarize experience, overcome shortcomings, and further improve sports work.

In recent years, due to the improvement of people's material life, the improvement of labor equipment, the development of medical care, the cultivation of clean and hygienic habits, and the promotion of sports, the health of our people has been significantly improved. However, because the old society destroyed the health of the working people, and the current national construction tasks are heavy, labor conditions and medical care cannot be completely and properly resolved in a short period of time, so that the people's health has not yet reached the proper level. Many cadres, students, workers, and farmers often have to affect their work or study due to poor health when undertaking relatively heavy work or study tasks. This situation requires us to continue to implement the Party Central Committee's instruction to "improve the people's health and enhance the people's physique," to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's call for "three goods," and to actively carry out sports to adapt to our country's great socialist construction tasks.

So, what specific requirements should there be for sports work?

Sports is a science and a part of socialist cultural construction. It is wrong to demand too much or too quickly from sports, without paying attention to the level of national economic and cultural construction development. However, it is also wrong to think that the country's various construction tasks are extremely heavy, sports work does not need to be actively carried out, or that it is not necessary to put forward certain requirements and formulate certain standards. At a time when our country is carrying out a great socialist revolution and construction, it is necessary to put forward certain requirements for the health of the people, especially the youth, just like scientific and technological knowledge, cultural and theoretical knowledge, and moral character cultivation. Only in this way can the physical conditions of the broad masses of the people adapt to the needs of various tasks, and can the youth truly achieve "three goods." Therefore, we should attach importance to sports, and put sports work into the entire national plan, and carry it out actively, steadily, and reliably.

In order to further improve sports work, we should pay attention to strengthening the specific leadership of sports associations at all levels. Since sports associations at all levels have been newly established in a relatively short period of time, the institutions are not yet sound and lack work experience. Therefore, it is necessary to enrich the content of activities, establish regular work, further consolidate grass-roots sports associations, and actively and responsibly solve various problems in mass exercises, so that the broad masses of the people can better participate in sports activities.

The Labor and Defense System is the foundation of China's sports system and is an advanced and scientific sports system. It has been implemented with good results and must continue to be implemented. However, during the implementation period, some places have reported that there are too many items, the standards are too high, the requirements are too urgent, and it seems too tense. Therefore, the items and standards under trial should be appropriately revised according to the actual situation, and relevant departments should earnestly strengthen the specific leadership of the Labor and Defense System work. In schools, the Labor and Defense System should be correctly and closely combined with physical education classes, and problems in the implementation of the Labor and Defense System should be studied at any time in order to continuously improve the work.

Competition activities should be unified in planning and establish a system to avoid confusion; we must improve the quality of competition and prevent unnecessary phenomena of missing work and classes. The textbooks, teaching methods, and system requirements for cadre training should be more enriched and improved. Youth and children's amateur sports activities should be carried out according to needs and possibilities. Sports scientific research work should be valued.

Sports workers should have an active, diligent, in-depth, meticulous, and assiduous work style, and should always strengthen contact with all relevant parties, always humbly listen to the opinions of all parties, and use various positive forces to do the work well. All relevant parties, public opinion, and people who care about sports and youth health should also actively support and help carry out sports, and often make criticisms and suggestions, so that China's sports can develop correctly under the cooperation of all relevant parties and the supervision of the masses.

Sports work is cared for and valued by the Party and the government, it is loved and supported by the broad masses of the people, especially the youth, and after several years of practice, it has proven to have great significance and effect on production and national defense. This work is not being done too much now, but it is not being done enough. We believe that after the National Sports Work Conference summarizes its experience, sports work can be done better, the people's sports cause will be further developed, and the level of sports technology will definitely be improved.

    对体育工作的要求
    全国体育工作会议的召开是及时的。体育工作在我国还是一项新的事业。目前体育运动已经取得的成绩，还远远赶不上国防建设和经济建设的需要，而且由于体育运动发展的迅速，也带来了很多值得重视的问题。因此必须继续不断地总结经验，克服缺点，进一步做好体育工作。
    近几年来，由于人民物质生活的提高，劳动设备的改善，医疗护理工作的发展，清洁卫生习惯的养成，以及体育运动的推行，我国人民的健康状况已经有了显著的改进。但是，因为旧社会对劳动人民身体的摧残，以及目前国家建设任务的繁重，劳动条件、药物护理还不能在短时间内完全妥善解决，以致人民的健康状况仍然没有达到应有的水平。不少干部、学生以及工人、农民在承担比较繁重的工作或学习任务时，常常因身体健康状况不良，不得不使工作或学习受到影响。这种情况，要求我们必须继续贯彻党中央“改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质”的指示，实现毛泽东同志的“三好”号召，积极开展体育运动，以适应我国伟大的社会主义建设任务。
    那末，对于体育工作究竟应该有些什么具体的要求呢？
    体育是一门科学，是社会主义文化建设的一部分。对体育运动要求过高过急，不注意国家经济建设、文化建设发展水平是不对的。但是认为国家各项建设任务异常繁重，体育工作不必积极进行，或者不必提出一定的要求和制定一定的标准也是不对的。在我国正在进行伟大的社会主义革命和建设的时候，对人民，特别是对青年的身体健康，需要同科学技术知识、文化理论知识和思想品德修养一样，提出一定的要求。只有这样，才能使广大人民的身体条件适应各项工作的需要，才能使青年真正做到“三好”。因此，应该重视体育运动，应该把体育工作放在整个国家计划中，积极、稳妥、可靠地去进行。
    为了进一步做好体育工作，当前应该注意加强对各级体育协会的具体领导。由于各级体育协会是在较短时期内新建立起来的，机构尚不健全，缺乏工作经验，所以必须充实活动内容，树立经常工作，进一步巩固基层体育协会，积极负责地解决群众锻炼中的各种问题，使广大群众更好地参加体育活动。
    劳卫制是我国体育制度的基础，是先进的、科学的体育制度，推行以来已收到良好的效果，必须继续推行。但在推行期间，有的地方反映项目过多，标准偏高，要求过急，显得过分紧张。因此，对于试行中的项目、标准，应根据实际情况进行适当修改，有关部门要切实加强对劳卫制工作的具体领导。在学校中要将劳卫制同体育课正确地密切结合，随时研究劳卫制推行中的问题，以便不断地改进工作。
    对于竞赛活动，应该统一规划，建立制度，以免混乱；要提高竞赛质量，防止不必要的误工误课的现象发生。干部训练的教材、教法、制度要求更加充实和完善。青年少年业余体育活动要根据需要和可能开展起来。体育科学研究工作，应该受到重视。
    体育工作者要具有积极努力、深入细致、刻苦钻研的工作作风，经常加强同各有关方面的联系，随时虚心听取各方面的意见，运用各种积极力量，把工作做好。各有关方面，社会舆论，以及关怀体育运动和青年健康的人们也应该积极支持和帮助开展体育运动，经常提出批评和建议，使我国体育运动在各有关方面的合作和群众监督下正确地发展起来。
    体育工作是为党和政府所关怀和重视的，它为广大人民群众，特别是青年所热爱和拥护，并且经过几年实践证明，对生产和国防更具有巨大的意义和作用。这个工作现在不是做得太多了，而是做得还不够。我们相信经过全国体育工作会议总结经验，体育工作一定可以做得更好，人民体育事业一定会进一步开展起来，运动技术水平一定可以得到提高。
