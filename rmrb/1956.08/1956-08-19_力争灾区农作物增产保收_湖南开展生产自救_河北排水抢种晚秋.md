    Strive for Increased Production and Harvest in Disaster Areas
    Hunan Carries Out Production for Self-Relief; Hebei Drains Water and Rush-Plants Late Autumn Crops
    (Reported by this newspaper) Farmers in the areas of Hunan Province that suffered the most severe drought, such as Shaoyang, Qianyang, Hengyang, and Chenxian, are actively planning and carrying out autumn and winter production, and are widely engaging in production for self-relief.
    Currently, although early rice in Hunan Province has generally achieved a bumper harvest, the drought has caused serious losses to intermediate rice and dryland crops in some areas, and has affected the planting area of late rice. According to statistics from the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the drought-affected area in Hunan Province has reached more than ten million mu, of which 600,000 mu have yielded no harvest, 3.5 million to 4 million mu will suffer severe yield reductions, and other miscellaneous grains will also be reduced by 50% compared to last year. The drought-stricken areas are mainly the five special districts of Hengyang, Shaoyang, Qianyang, Xiangtan, and Chenxian. In addition, the drought-affected area in Changde Special District is 670,000 mu, and in Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, it is 380,000 mu. The disaster situation is still developing. In the province, 1.61 million mu of late rice could not be planted due to the drought. In order to salvage the losses from the drought and ensure increased income for farmers, all localities have made serious analyses of the current situation at county party secretary meetings or telephone conferences, and have decided to take the following measures to carry out production for self-relief: expand the area of autumn-sown crops; seize the harvest of mid-season rice and implement careful threshing and harvesting; strengthen the cultivation and management of late rice and other existing crops; and develop sideline production according to local conditions.
    All disaster-stricken counties have transferred a large number of cadres, led by the responsible cadres of the county, to go deep into key areas to lead the masses in fighting the drought while rushing to plant or replant. From the county to the township to the cooperative, everyone is actively revising autumn and winter production plans, expanding the area of autumn planting, and increasing grain output. In the 16 joint cooperatives of the eighth district of Chenxi County in Qianyang Special District, more than 4,000 mu of rice seedlings were drought-stricken and died, and all of them have now been replanted with miscellaneous grains. In Nanshan Agricultural Cooperative of Longhui County in Shaoyang Special District, more than 4,000 mu of fields have suffered from drought. The cooperative's party branch and cooperative management committee mobilized members to use 320 waterwheels day and night in three shifts to draw water, striving to save more than 2,000 mu of mid-season rice. On the one hand, they are processing and fertilizing the more than 1,000 mu of rice fields that have been rescued, striving for greater increases in production; at the same time, they are expanding autumn planting and promoting intercropping. Autumn miscellaneous crops have been expanded from the original plan of more than 3,100 mu to more than 5,800 mu, and more than 20,000 jin of seeds and more than 40,000 dan of fertilizer have been prepared. In addition, 154 laborers have been drawn to operate 13 kinds of sideline production. Hengyang Special District plans to expand the autumn planting area to 4.04 million mu on the basis of last year's 3.6 million mu. The shortage of seeds will be solved through mutual adjustment and local purchase.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 18th. As the water level of each river steadily declines, various preparations for autumn planting and rush-planting of late-autumn fast-maturing crops in the water-damaged areas of Hebei Province have been fully launched.
    According to incomplete statistics, Hebei Province has currently drained more than 8.5 million mu of accumulated water. More than 1 million jin of vegetable seeds and 700,000 jin of buckwheat seeds prepared by relevant departments have been successively transported to the disaster areas to ensure timely replanting of dehydrated land. Ding County has rush-planted more than 100,000 mu of buckwheat and more than 10,000 mu of vegetables on the 400,000 mu of land that has been drained.
    In order to ensure timely wheat planting, 65 million jin of high-quality wheat seeds transferred from Shaanxi Province to Hebei Province have begun to be transferred.

    力争灾区农作物增产保收
    湖南开展生产自救　河北排水抢种晚秋
    本报讯　湖南省遭受旱灾最严重的邵阳、黔阳、衡阳、郴县等地区农民，正在积极规划和进行秋冬生产，广泛地开展生产自救工作。
    目前，湖南全省早稻虽然普遍获得丰收，但旱灾又给部分地区的中稻和旱田作物带来严重的损失，并且影响到晚稻的种植面积。据中共湖南省委统计，湖南全省受旱面积已达一千多万亩，其中有六十万亩颗粒无收，有三百五十万亩到四百万亩要严重减产，其他杂粮也将比去年减产50％。受旱地区主要是衡阳、邵阳、黔阳、湘潭、郴县等五个专区。另外，常德专区受旱面积有六十七万亩，湘西苗族自治州三十八万亩。灾情尚在发展中。全省因旱灾不能播下晚稻的有一百六十一万亩。为了挽救旱灾损失，确保农民增加收入，各地都在县委书记会议或电话会议上，对当前情况作了认真的分析，决定采取以下措施，开展生产自救；扩大秋种作物面积；抓紧中稻收割，实行细打细收；加强晚稻和其他现有农作物的培育管理；因地制宜，开展副业生产。
    受灾各县都抽调了大批干部，由县的负责干部率领深入到重点地区，领导群众一面抗旱，一面抢种或改种。从县到乡到社，都在积极修订秋冬生产计划，扩大秋种面积，增加粮食产量。黔阳专区辰溪县第八区十六个联社，旱死禾苗四千多亩，现已全部改种杂粮。邵阳专区隆回县南山农业社有四千多亩田受旱，该社党支部和社务管理委员会发动社员用三百二十部水车日夜三班轮流车水，力争抢救二千亩以上中稻。一方面在已救出的一千多亩稻田中加工加肥，争取更多增产；同时扩大秋种，推行间作。秋杂作物由原计划三千一百多亩扩种到五千八百多亩，现已准备了二万多斤种子，四万多担肥料。另外还抽出一百五十四个劳力，经营十三种副业生产。衡阳专区秋种面积，计划在去年三百六十万亩的基础上，扩大到四百零四万亩。缺种问题，通过互相调剂，就地收购，求得解决。
    据新华社保定18日电　随着各河水势平稳下降，河北省水灾地区秋种的各项准备和抢种晚秋快熟作物等工作已经全面展开。
    据不完全的统计，目前河北全省已经排出积水八百五十多万亩，有关部门备好的一百多万斤蔬菜和七十万斤荞麦种籽，已先后运往灾区，保证了脱水土地及时抢种。定县已在泄水的四十万亩土地上，抢种上十万多亩荞麦和一万多亩蔬菜。
    为了保证适时种麦，从陕西省调拨河北省的六千五百万斤优良麦种，已经开始调运。
