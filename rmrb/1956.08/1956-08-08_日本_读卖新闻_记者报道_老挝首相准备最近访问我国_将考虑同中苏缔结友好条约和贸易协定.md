Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Tokyo Dispatch: The "Yomiuri Shimbun" reporter reported from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, on the 6th, that the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Souvanna Phouma, intends to visit China in the near future. After the Lao issue is resolved, a Lao delegation of about twenty people, headed by the Prime Minister, will visit China.

Phouma said that the Royal Government is considering the issue of concluding treaties of friendship and trade agreements with China and the Soviet Union. The Royal Government supports the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and based on these principles, the Royal Government hopes to normalize relations with major countries, including China.

Phouma said that among these five principles, mutual non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are particularly important. His country is prepared to deal with any foreign aggression. He also said that, as described in the Geneva Accords, the Kingdom will maintain neutrality and will not participate in any military blocs.

In his conversation with the Japanese reporter, Phouma also expressed the hope to conclude trade and economic cooperation agreements with Japan.
