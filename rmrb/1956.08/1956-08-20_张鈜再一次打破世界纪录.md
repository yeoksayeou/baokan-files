    Zhang Hong Breaks World Record Again

    Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: Beijing marksman Zhang Hong once again broke the world record for the 25-meter rapid fire pistol silhouette target event for men in the shooting athlete selection performance competition that concluded today.

    Twenty-two-year-old Zhang Hong fired sixty bullets, hitting a total of 585 rings (full ring is 600 rings), exceeding the world record of 584 rings created by Soviet athlete Kalinichenko in 1954. However, Zhang Hong's score this time was two rings less than the 587 rings he achieved in the shooting competition held in Shanghai in mid-July this year.

    The head of the selection performance competition organizing office said that Zhang Hong's new world record cannot be recognized as an official world record, because according to international rules, a new shooting world record must be created in a world competition to be recognized.

    Li Jie (Beijing), who won second place in the silhouette rapid fire competition, and Dong Ruiguang (Zhejiang), who won third place, both scored 582 rings. Their scores and Zhang Hong's score all exceeded the 575-ring standard for Chinese Master of Sport.

    Today also held the men's military rifle 300-meter distance standing, kneeling, and prone shooting competition. Zhao Shanjun from Shandong won first place with a score of 1,072 rings. Liu Jiaqiu from Hunan won second place with a score of 1,051 rings. (Attached picture)

    张鈜再一次打破世界纪录
    据新华社19日讯　北京市的射击运动员张鈜在今天结束的射击运动员选拔表演赛中，再一次打破了男子自选小口径手枪人像靶二十五公尺距离速射的世界纪录。
    二十二岁的张鈜发射六十发子弹共命中了585环（满环是六百环），超过了苏联运动员卡列尼钦科在1954年创造的584环的世界纪录。但是张鈜这次的成绩，比他今年七月中旬在上海参加射击比赛时创造的587环的纪录要少两环。
    选拔表演赛组织处的负责人说，张鈜创造的新世界纪录并不能被承认为正式的世界纪录，因为按照国际规则规定，新的射击世界纪录必须是在世界比赛中创造的，才能被得到承认。
    获得人像靶速射比赛第二名的李杰（北京）和第三名的董瑞光（浙江）的成绩都是582环，他们和张鈜的成绩都超过了中国运动健将级575环的标准。
    今天还举行了男子军用步枪三百公尺距离立、跪、卧姿射击比赛，山东选手赵善俊以1，072环的成绩获得第一名。湖南选手刘佳秋获得第二名，成绩是1，051环。（附图片）
