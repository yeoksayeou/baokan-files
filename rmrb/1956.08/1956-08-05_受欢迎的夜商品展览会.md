    Popular Night Goods Exhibition

    (Our report) During the busy season of rush harvesting and planting, members of the Ling'an Township agricultural cooperative in Chongde County, Jiangsu Province, are busy from dawn until dusk. This year's spring harvest was abundant, and the income of more than 90% of the cooperative members has increased compared to last year. It is precisely the time when the members have surplus money in hand, but they do not have time to go to the streets to buy things.

    In late June, the Ling'an Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized the cooperative groups and the twelve public-private joint ventures in the town, along with fifteen peddlers and two "peddler boats," to go to the countryside to supply farmers with daily necessities and production materials, achieving "delivery to the door, to the cooperative." They loaded more than 400 kinds of commodities, including the non-staple foods, farm tools, general merchandise, cotton cloth, and sprayers that farmers urgently needed, and used the evening hours to hold night "commodity exhibitions" in the agricultural cooperatives. They have toured and exhibited eight times, and have been welcomed by the local farmers. At a night commodity exhibition held in the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Qianlin Township, the turnover reached more than 600 yuan. The farmers all said that they hoped they would often deliver goods to the countryside in the future. (Wen Duancao)

    受欢迎的夜商品展览会
    本报讯　在抢收抢种的农忙季节里，江苏省崇德县灵安乡的农业社社员们，从天蒙蒙亮一直忙到黄昏。今年春花丰收，农业社百分之九十以上的社员的收入都比去年增加了，正是社员手中有余钱的时候，他们却没有时间上街买东西。
    六月下旬，灵安镇供销合作社就把这个镇上的合作小组和公私合营的十二个行业、十五担货郎担和二只“货郎船”组织起来，下乡巡回供应农民日常用品和生产资料，做到“送货上门、上社”。他们装载了当前农民迫切需要的副食品、农具、百货、棉布和喷雾器等四百多种商品，利用晚上的时间，在农业社召开夜“商品展览会”。他们先后巡回展览了八次，受到当地农民欢迎。在钱林乡胜利农业社召开的一次夜商品展览会上，营业额达到六百多元。农民们都说，希望他们以后常常送货下乡来。　（温端操）
