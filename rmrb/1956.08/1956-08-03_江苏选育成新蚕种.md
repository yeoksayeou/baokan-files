Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 1st. A new variety of silkworm capable of reeling high-grade raw silk has been successfully bred at the Hushu Pass Sericulture School in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province.

    The new silkworm variety produces long cocoon silk with fine denier, suitable for reeling high-grade raw silk. The new silkworm variety is produced by crossbreeding Hucan No. 1 and No. 2. After several years of breeding trials and continuous selection, it has a high cocoon yield. This silkworm variety still needs to undergo feeding identification in rural areas before it can be promoted.
