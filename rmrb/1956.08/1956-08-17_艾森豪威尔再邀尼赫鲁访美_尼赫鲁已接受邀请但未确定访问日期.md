Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 15th: The White House announced on August 14th that U.S. President Eisenhower has issued a new invitation to Indian Prime Minister Nehru to visit the United States.

　　Nehru was originally scheduled to visit the United States in July of this year. However, Eisenhower fell ill in June, and Nehru suggested postponing his visit.

　　United Press International reported: "This new invitation emphasizes President Eisenhower's desire to maintain close personal relations with Nehru, an influential figure in Far Eastern affairs and the nominal leader of the so-called neutral bloc of nations."

　　The report added that many believe Eisenhower could use the talks with Nehru to "dispel Nehru's doubts and concerns about U.S. foreign policy" and bring India "closer to the United States than before."

　　According to an Associated Press report from New Delhi on the 14th, a spokesman for Nehru told Congress on Tuesday that Nehru has accepted Eisenhower's re-invitation, but no date has been set for the visit.

　　The report said that Nehru's trip to Washington is expected to take place after the U.S. presidential election in November.

    艾森豪威尔再邀尼赫鲁访美
    尼赫鲁已接受邀请但未确定访问日期
    据新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫八月十四日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经向印度总理尼赫鲁发出一项请他访问美国的新的邀请。
    尼赫鲁原订在今年七月间访问美国。但是在六月间艾森豪威尔生了病，尼赫鲁建议推迟他的访问。
    合众社消息说：“这项新的邀请强调说明了艾森豪威尔总统希望保持和尼赫鲁这个在远东事务举足轻重的人物和所谓中立国家集团名义上的领袖的密切的私人关系。”
    消息又说，许多人认为艾森豪威尔可以利用同尼赫鲁的会谈来“解除尼赫鲁对美国外交政策的怀疑和顾虑”，使印度“比以前靠近美国”。
    据美联社新德里十四日的消息，尼赫鲁的一位发言人星期二告诉国会说，尼赫鲁已经接受了艾森豪威尔的再度邀请，但是没有确定这次访问的日期。
    消息说，人们认为，尼赫鲁的华盛顿之行将在今年十一月美国总统选举以后进行。
