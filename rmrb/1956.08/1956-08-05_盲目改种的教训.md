The Hengmei Township Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, which achieved a bumper harvest of early rice, saw more than 60% of its members' income decrease compared to the same period last year. What's going on? After a recent inspection, the cooperative determined that this was due to the blind change in the spring, when dry land that had always been rotated and intercropped with various crops was converted to grain crops, mainly rice.

Hengmei Township is close to the town and is a hilly area. The township has 1,400 mu of paddy fields on flat land and 500 mu of dry land on high ground. However, there are many people and little land, with an average of just over seven fen of land per person. For a long time, local farmers have been accustomed to planting rice in paddy fields on flat land, and continuously rotating and intercropping peanuts, vegetables, sugarcane and other crops on dry land on high ground from the beginning to the end of the year. These drylands can generate an average annual income of about 300 yuan per mu, which is almost four times more than growing rice, and even more than growing sorghum. In addition, the vines and leaves of peanut and other crops can be used to raise pigs, so almost every household raised pigs in the past. By relying on such operations, the lives of local farmers could still be maintained.

This spring, after the establishment of a single advanced cooperative in the township, all but 100 mu of the 500 mu of dry land were converted to grain crops. Most were converted to rice, and a small portion was converted to sorghum. At that time, the members opposed this. Some members even thought to themselves that they had joined the wrong cooperative. After a rough calculation, the cooperative's cadres also knew that such operations would not increase income; but they had to change the crops because the district leadership insisted on it.

The result of the change was: a summer harvest of 300 jin of sorghum per mu, and an increase in early rice from 290 jin to 400 jin per mu compared to last year, with a total output increase of more than 250,000 jin. Although grain production increased, the original multiple income streams within half a year became only one income stream. At the same time, due to the lack of feed, the number of pigs decreased from 500 to 300. The cooperative has not engaged in other sideline occupations, except for the 400 ducks that were recently raised. The cooperative's income in the first half of the year decreased by about 45% compared to the same period last year. The income of many members was less than half of what it was in the first half of last year. As a result, the members were very dissatisfied, starting work at eight o'clock every morning and finishing at four o'clock in the afternoon, with one or two hours of rest in between. Some members sat idly at the construction site, unwilling to work. Another 120 members requested permission to go to the city to seek a living.

Faced with such a serious situation, the cooperative's cadres and the district leadership realized that the crop change this spring was indeed a mistake. The cooperative decided to restore the original rotation and intercropping of various crops on the high-altitude dry land in the second half of the year, and proposed to expand diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, striving to have income soon to make up for the shortfall in the first half of the year. The members expressed their agreement one after another, and production enthusiasm generally increased. At present, the members have started to prepare the ridges for sowing according to the plan for rotating and intercropping dryland crops in the second half of the year. The cooperative has also established six sideline production teams, and in addition to the ducks, sheep and fish that have already been raised, plans to increase the number of chickens and ducks by more than 2,000 and 71 sows within one or two months. The piglets born to the sows will be provided for the members to raise privately. From September onwards, various crops in the dryland will begin to mature, and there can be income every month. It is estimated that the income from dryland alone in the second half of the year will be more than 74,000 yuan, which is more than double the income from growing late rice. The total income for the second half of the year is estimated to be 190 yuan per member household, which will be an increase compared to the same period last year.

    盲目改种的教训
    新华社记者　梁福擎
    获得早稻丰收的广东省中山县恒美乡高级农业生产合作社，今年上半年有60％以上的社员收入比去年同期减少了。这是怎么一回事呢？最近社里对此作了检查，肯定是今年春季盲目地把历来轮种、间种各种作物的旱田，改种了以水稻为主的粮食作物所致。
    恒美乡邻近城镇，是一片丘陵地带。全乡平地有一千四百亩水田，高地有五百亩旱田，不过，人多地少，平均每人只有七分多田。长时期以来，当地农民习惯在平地的水田里种水稻，在高地的旱田里从年头至年尾不断轮种、间种花生、蔬菜、甘蔗等作物。这些旱田平均每亩全年可以收入三百元左右，比种水稻的收入将近多四倍，比种高粱的收入就更多了。再加花生等作物的藤叶可以用来养猪，因此过去差不多是户户养猪的。就是依靠这样的经营，当地农民的生活还可以维持得过去。
    今年春季全乡成立单一的高级社后，五百亩旱田除留一百亩种甘蔗外，其余都改种了粮食作物。大部分改种了水稻，小部分改种了高粱。当时社员就反对这样做。有的社员还暗想眼看是入错了社了。社的干部经过大略的算账，也知道这样的经营是不可能增加收入的；但想到区的领导机关一定要改种，而不得不改种。
    改种的结果是：夏收高粱每亩三百斤，早稻每亩从去年的二百九十斤增加到四百斤，总产量也比去年增加二十五万多斤。虽然粮食增产了，但是原来半年内可以有多次收入，现在变成了只有一次收入。同时，由于缺乏饲料，猪的数目从五百头减少到三百头。社里除了在最近才养的四百只鸭以外，没有经营其他的副业。全社上半年的收入约比去年同期减少了45％。许多社员的收入还不及去年上半年的一半。于是，社员大为不满，出勤时每天早上八点才开工，下午四点就收工，中间还休息一两个钟头。有些社员到了工地就闲坐，不愿干活。还有一百二十个社员要求准许到城市去谋生。
    面对这样严重的情况，社的干部和区的领导机关知道今年春季的改种是真的错了。社里决定下半年高地的旱田恢复原来轮种、间种各种作物，并且提出扩大因地制宜多种经营的办法，争取最近就有收入来弥补上半年的不足。社员们纷纷表示同意，生产情绪普遍高涨。目前社员们已经按照下半年旱田轮种、间种的计划，开始整垄播种了。全社还成立了六个副业生产队，除已经养的鸭、羊和鱼外，还准备在一两个月内增养二千多只鸡、鸭和七十一头母猪。母猪生下的小猪，将供给社员私养。从九月份起，旱田里的各种作物开始成熟，便可以月月有收入。估计下半年单旱田的收入就有七万四千多元，比种晚稻的收入多出一倍多。下半年全部收入平均每户社员可以有一百九十元，将比去年同期有所增加。
