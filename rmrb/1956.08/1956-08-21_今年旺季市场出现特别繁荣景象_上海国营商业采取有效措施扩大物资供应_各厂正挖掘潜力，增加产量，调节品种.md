Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th. This year, peak season markets across the country have shown extraordinary prosperity. Representatives from state-owned commercial departments across the country have recently come to Shanghai to request the supply of more goods. The amount of various daily-use general merchandise they require for the fourth quarter alone exceeds Shanghai's supply capacity by nearly one time. Almost every region is requesting temporary sources of goods in addition to the originally contracted third-quarter amounts.

Currently, Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments are taking various measures to expand supply. Procurement and supply stations of companies dealing in knitwear, cotton goods, general merchandise, and textiles have conducted research with relevant industrial departments. Some have even sent personnel to factories to help them tap potential and increase production. More than seventy weaving, cotton blanket, wool textile, shirt, and raincoat factories have increased or fully utilized shifts according to the requirements of the commercial departments, and the commercial departments are finding ways to supply them with the raw materials needed for increased production. According to market demand, some factories are starting to adjust product varieties, reducing the production of plain socks, 42-count yarn handkerchiefs, bamboo shell thermos bottles, and enamel basins, which are already in large supply in Shanghai, and increasing the production of children's socks, cotton socks, iron shell thermos bottles, and enamel mugs, which are in widespread demand in various regions. Some procurement and supply stations are also purchasing inventory from factories and handicraft production cooperatives; others are conducting commodity sorting and rationally reducing inventory to expand supply. Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments originally planned to supply a total number of goods to various regions in the second half of the year that was already 18% higher than the same period last year. After taking the above measures, Shanghai will supply an additional 1.5 million pairs of rubber shoes, 76 million meters of cotton cloth, 120,000 kilograms of woolen yarn, 1.9 million cans of meat and fruit, and more than 600,000 dozens of towels, socks, shirts, wool gloves, enamel mugs, and iron shell thermos bottles to various regions this year. Some of these goods have already been shipped out ahead of schedule.

    今年旺季市场出现特别繁荣景象
    上海国营商业采取有效措施扩大物资供应
    各厂正挖掘潜力，增加产量，调节品种
    新华社上海20日电　今年各地旺季市场出现了特别繁荣的景象。全国各地国营商业部门的代表最近纷纷到上海要求供应更多的商品，单是他们提出第四季度需要的各种日用百货，就超过了上海供应能力的近一倍。几乎每个地区都要求在原订第三季度合同以外补充临时货源。
    目前，上海国营商业部门正在采取各种措施，以扩大供应。针棉织品、百货、纺织品等公司的采购供应站分别和有关工业部门进行了研究，有的双方还派出人员下厂，帮助工厂挖掘潜力，增加产量。七十多个织布、棉毯、毛纺、衬衫、雨衣工厂已经根据商业部门的要求，增加或开足了班次，而商业部门也设法供应他们增产需要的原料。根据市场的要求，有些工厂正着手调节生产品种，减少一部分上海备货较多的平口袜、四十二支纱手帕、竹壳热水瓶、搪瓷面盆的产量，增产各地普遍需要的童袜、棉毛袜、铁壳热水瓶、搪瓷口杯等商品。有的采购供应站还向工厂、手工业生产合作社收购存货；有的进行了商品排队，合理压缩库存来扩大供应。上海国营商业部门原来计划在下半年供应各地的商品总数，已经比去年同期增加18％。采取了上述这些措施后，年内上海将多供应各地一百五十万双胶鞋、七千六百万公尺棉布、十二万斤毛线、一百九十万听肉类、水果罐头和六十多万打毛巾、袜子、衬衫、羊毛手套、搪瓷口杯、铁壳热水瓶等。这些商品中有一部分已经提早运出。
