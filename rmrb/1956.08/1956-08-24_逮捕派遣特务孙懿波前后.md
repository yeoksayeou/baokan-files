Before and After the Arrest of KMT Special Agent Sun Yibo
    Lu Qing
    On August 17, 1956, I and my comrades, acting under the law, arrested Sun Yibo, a special agent sent to Beijing by the "Intelligence Bureau of the National Security Bureau" of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service in Taiwan.

    At 8:30 in the morning, we arrived by car at Sun Yibo's residence at No. 8, Huoyaoju Third Alley. We walked to the door of the north room where he lived, and Sun Yibo, who was sitting on the sofa, suddenly stood up.

    I rushed forward and told him, "Don't move!"

    At this moment, Sun Yibo instinctively and violently shivered. But he immediately suppressed it.

    I announced, "We, the Beijing Public Security Bureau, with the approval of the Beijing Procuratorate, now announce to you: You are under arrest!"

    "I don't know why you are doing this?"

    Hearing his questioning tone and feigned calm, it seemed he wanted to express some "protest." Based on experience, I immediately judged: this was a "resolute element," and he still harbored侥幸 thoughts and was preparing to resist! I immediately said, "No, you know what you have done. The question now is: it's best if you voluntarily hand over the evidence of your criminal activities. It will be much better for you to hand it over voluntarily than for us to search it out!"

    "I don't know. Search if you want!" Sure enough, Sun Yibo adopted a self-destructive attitude.

    At the same time, one of our comrades was talking to Sun Yibo's wife, Lin Yongtao, in another room. Lin Yongtao, 22 years old this year, graduated from Maria High School in Hong Kong. Introduced by Sun Yibo, she joined the secret service organization, received special agent training in Taiwan, and was assigned as Sun Yibo's lieutenant-level radio operator. She married Sun in Hong Kong and secretly came to Beijing together. Originally, she should also have been arrested, but because she is now pregnant, the government, in the spirit of humanitarianism, did not arrest her. After our comrade explained the policy to her and told her the advantages and disadvantages, she immediately said: I am determined to confess and hand over all the evidence.

    Lin Yongtao first opened a leather bag containing disguises and took out two bottles. One bottle contained invisible ink, and the other contained invisible ink protection solution. Lin Yongtao said that the Hong Kong secret service originally issued a packet of powder for the invisible ink. After Sun Yibo arrived in Beijing, he dissolved it in distilled water for easy use. Then, she opened a suitcase, turned out a small notebook, and took out a piece of paper from the notebook. The paper contained two communication contact addresses in Hong Kong left to him by the Hong Kong secret service. Lin Yongtao also handed over some other evidence.

    Ironclad evidence was on the table, and Sun Yibo, crouching in the corner, buried his head between his legs, trying to hide his panic. But he was speechless.

    When we collected these counter-revolutionary evidences, completed the necessary legal procedures, and escorted the special agent away, I suddenly glanced at the coffee table next to the sofa where Sun Yibo had been sitting. It was actually holding a thick book of Marxist-Leninist works—a textbook on political economy, with a bookmark in it!

    Before, I had roughly understood what kind of special agent Sun Yibo was, but now I saw even more clearly what a stubborn, cunning, and foolish fellow he was.

    ×　×　×

    Sun Yibo was originally a Kuomintang army colonel regiment commander. After being defeated by our army, he fled to Hong Kong in 1949 and joined the Chiang Kai-shek secret service "Bureau of Confidentiality." He was appreciated by the secret service boss Mao Renfeng, and he received special agent training in Taiwan. In March 1956, he was appointed as a colonel group leader by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service "Intelligence Bureau of the National Security Bureau," received a special agent fund of 9,000 Hong Kong dollars, and secretly came to the mainland. His mission was to collect intelligence, develop secret service organizations, and establish secret radio stations.

    On the first day Sun Yibo returned to the motherland, he began his criminal activities. That day, he went to Guangzhou to find his old subordinate, Luo Guangzhu, the former major battalion commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 57th Division of the Kuomintang army. He used coercion and enticement to develop Luo Guangzhu as an enemy intelligence agent, and gave Luo a copy of the secret code, more than 120 yuan in Renminbi, and ordered Luo to actively collect intelligence and send it directly to the Hong Kong secret service. Luo Guangzhu was originally a reactionary element. After Sun Yibo's co-opting, he revived his activities.

    After Sun Yibo arrived in Beijing, he told everyone that he was "returning to the motherland to participate in socialist construction," disguising himself as an intellectual who wanted to make progress, and registered to find a job.

    In July, Beijing launched a campaign to publicize the policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements. Sun Yibo attended four propaganda meetings held by the police station. All these meetings fully explained the policy, and more than once mentioned examples of dispatched special agents who confessed and surrendered and received lenient treatment. However, Sun Yibo was completely unmoved by all of this.

    It seems that this special agent believed that he was hiding very cleverly. He probably felt that he could "take root" and lie dormant, waiting for an opportunity to sabotage. Good, then let him taste the iron fist of the people!

    After Sun Yibo was arrested, we immediately notified his family. At 5 p.m., at No. 8, Huoyaoju Third Alley, I met Sun Yibo's elder brother, a professor at a university of technology.

    He came from the western suburbs, still breathless, and asked me about the details of Sun Yibo's arrest.

    I first briefly explained the reasons for Sun Yibo's arrest and Lin Yongtao's situation. Then, I handed the search record to Professor Sun to read. He quickly looked at the material written with facts, and his face showed agitation and indignation. This was completely understandable. Yesterday, this younger brother was still saying, "Returning to the motherland to participate in socialist construction"; now, Sun Yibo was confirmed to be a shameful special agent who sabotaged the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Professor Sun said heavily, "Alas! I was too negligent! I never thought about this before. This time he came back, I helped him go through the entry procedures at the police station..." He suddenly asked me as if he remembered something, "Is he related to that Luo Guangzhu in Guangzhou?"

    I replied yes.

    He said, "You see, how negligent, Luo Guangzhu sent him a letter, which was forwarded by my sister. The letter said he wanted to borrow money from him. Now that I think about it, the tone was very suspicious. At that time, I only thought that this Luo had a reactionary background in history, and I asked my sister to turn him back! I didn't expect them to be doing this, this..."

    I saw the heaviness and pain in Professor Sun's emotions. Indeed, Sun Yibo completely concealed and deceived his elder brother. After Sun Yibo arrived in Beijing, in order to prevent people from suspecting his source of income, he said that Lin Yongtao was the daughter of a Hong Kong capitalist and her family was very rich, and they would continue to receive financial support. He also said that the 800 yuan in Renminbi he had transferred from Hong Kong to the mainland through the bank before he came, and the three or four thousand Hong Kong dollars he brought with him, were all given to them by Lin Yongtao's family. In fact, this was all the dirtiest money—special agent funds.

    I also told Professor Sun that although Lin Yongtao had initially confessed to the problem, her understanding of her crimes was not enough. I hoped that he would educate Lin Yongtao more, so that she would recognize her sins, see her future clearly, dispel her worries, and confess completely.

    Professor Sun repeatedly said, "Yes! All these measures of the government are completely correct! I fully support them! I myself will make a review to the school organization!"

    When I said goodbye to Professor Sun, he shook my hand and said again, "Alas! I really didn't expect him to be such a counter-revolutionary..."

    Yes! The current class struggle is still complex, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is still sharp, and people still need to be vigilant!

    逮捕派遣特务孙懿波前后
    鲁青
    1956年8月17日，我和同志们奉命依法逮捕了台湾蒋介石的特务机关“国家安全局情报局”派来北京的特务分子孙懿波。
    上午八点半，我们乘车到达火药局三条八号孙懿波的住址。我们走到他住的北屋门口，在沙发上坐着的孙懿波就猛然地立起来。
    我赶上前去，告诉他：“不要动！”
    这时，孙懿波全身本能地、急剧地打了一阵寒战。但他马上又抑止住了。
    我宣布：“我们北京市公安局经北京市检察院批准，现在向你宣布：你被捕了！”
    “我不知道你们这是为什么？”
    听他这反问的口气和故作镇静的态度，似乎还要表示点“抗议”。按照经验，我立刻判明：这是个“坚决分子”，他现在还心存侥幸，准备顽抗呢！我马上说：“不，你作的事情你知道。现在问题是：最好你把你进行犯罪活动的罪证，自动缴出来。自动缴出来比我们给你搜查出来，对你来说要好得多！”
    “我不知道。你们搜吧！”果然，孙懿波是采取了自绝的态度。
    就在这同时，我们的一位同志在另一个房间里同孙懿波的妻子林咏涛进行了谈话。林咏涛，今年二十二岁，在香港玛丽亚高中毕业，经孙懿波介绍参加特务组织，在台湾受了特务训练，配属为孙懿波的上尉报务员，在香港和孙结婚，一同潜来北京。本来她也是罪应逮捕的，但因为她现在怀孕，政府本着人道主义的精神未予逮捕。当我们的同志向她阐明政策，晓以利害以后，她马上表示：我决心坦白，把罪证全缴出来。
    林咏涛首先打开了一个装有化装品的皮包，从中取出两个瓶子来，一瓶是密写药水，另一瓶是密写保护药水。林咏涛说，关于密写药，香港特务机关原来发给的是一包药粉，孙懿波到北京以后，用蒸馏水溶成了药水，以便随时使用。接着，她又打开了一个皮箱，翻出一个小本，从小本里取出一页纸片，纸片上是孙懿波写的香港特务留给他的两个通讯联络地址。林咏涛还交出另外一些罪证。
    铁一般的罪证都摆在桌面上了，而蹲在墙角的孙懿波，还把脑袋缩在两条腿当中，努力掩饰着他的惊慌。但是他已经哑口无言了。
    当我们收起这些反革命罪证，办完应有的法律手续，押走这个特务分子的时候，我突然瞥见在原来孙懿波坐的那张沙发旁的茶几上，居然放着厚厚的一本马列主义著作——政治经济学教科书，书里还夹着一个书签哩！
    从前，我已经大致了解到孙懿波是一个怎样的特务，现在我就更清楚地看出了这是一个多么顽固、狡猾而又愚蠢的家伙。
          ×　×　×
    孙懿波原先是个蒋伪军的上校团长，被我军击溃后，在1949年逃往香港，参加了蒋介石特务机关“保密局”。他得到了特务头子毛人凤的赏识，他在台湾受了专门的特务训练。1956年3月他接受蒋介石特务机关“国家安全局情报局”的派遣被任命为上校组长，领到特务经费港币九千元，潜来大陆。他的任务是搜集情报、发展特务组织，建立秘密电台。
    孙懿波回到祖国大陆的第一天，就开始了他的罪恶活动。当天他去广州找到了他的旧部下、曾任蒋军57师2团少校营长的罗广洙，用胁威利诱的方法，发展罗广洙充当敌特情报员，并交给罗密药一份，人民币一百二十多元，布置罗积极搜集情报，直接向香港特务机关寄发。罗广洙本来也是个反动分子，经孙懿波这一笼络，就死灰复燃地积极活动起来了。
    孙懿波来到北京以后，逢人便讲他是“回祖国参加社会主义建设的”，把自己装扮成要求进步的知识分子的样子，登记找职业。
    七月间，北京市展开关于对反革命分子的镇压与宽大相结合的政策宣传，孙懿波参加了四次派出所召开的宣传会议。所有这些会议都全面地交代了政策，也不只一次讲到派遣特务坦白自首受到宽大处理的实例。然而，孙懿波对这一切完全无动于衷。
    看来，这个特务分子相信自己隐蔽得很巧妙，大概他觉得是可以“扎下根”，潜伏下去，待机破坏的。好，那就让他尝尝人民的铁拳滋味吧！
          ×　×　×
    孙懿波被捕后，我们立即通知了他的家属。下午五点，在火药局三条八号，我会见了孙懿波的哥哥，一位工业大学的教授。
    他从西郊赶来，气喘未定，就问我关于孙懿波被捕的原委。
    我首先简要地说明孙懿波被捕的原因和林咏涛的情况。接着，就把搜查记录交给孙教授看。他迅速地看着用事实写下来的材料，脸上显示出激动和愤慨。这是完全可以理解的。昨天，这位弟弟还口口声声说：“回祖国是参加社会主义建设”的；现在，孙懿波却被证实是破坏祖国社会主义建设的可耻的特务分子。
    孙教授沉重地说：“唉！我太麻痹了！从前，我就没有往这方面想过。他这次回来，是我替他到派出所办理的入境手续……。”他忽然像想起什么事情一样地问我：“他和广州的那个罗广洙是不是有关系？”
    我回答说是。
    他说：“你看看，这多麻痹，罗广洙给他来过信，是由我妹妹转的，信里说要向他借钱，现在想起来，口气很可疑。那时，我只想到这个姓罗的在历史上有反动身份，我让妹妹给挡回去了！没想到他们是干这，这……”。
    我看出了孙教授情绪上的沉重和痛苦。确实，孙懿波是完全隐瞒和欺骗了他的哥哥的。孙懿波到北京以后，为了不使人怀疑他的经济来源，他说林咏涛是香港资本家的小姐，家里很有钱，将来还源源不断接济。他把他从香港来大陆前通过银行汇进来的八百元人民币和随身带来的三、四千元港币，也说成是林咏涛家里给他们的。事实上这都是最肮脏的钱——特务经费。
    我还告诉孙教授，林咏涛虽然初步交代了问题，但对罪行的认识还不够，希望他对林咏涛多加教育，使他认清罪恶，看清前途，解除顾虑，彻底坦白。
    孙教授一再表示：“对啊！政府这一切措施，完全正确！我完全拥护！我自己要向学校组织上检讨！”
    我和孙教授告别的时候，他握着我的手又说了一句：“唉！我真没料到他是这样一个反革命……”
    是啊！当前的阶级斗争还是复杂的，革命和反革命的斗争还是尖锐的，人们还需要警惕啊！
