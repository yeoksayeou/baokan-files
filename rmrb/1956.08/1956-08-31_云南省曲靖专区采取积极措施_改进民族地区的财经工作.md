    Kunming, this paper, 29th. Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has adopted active measures to improve financial and economic work in ethnic minority areas.
    In commercial work, the primary focus has been on strengthening the procurement of local and special products from mountainous rural areas, especially mountain goods, medicinal materials, and livestock products such as pigs, cattle, and sheep. Items suitable for external transfer are transferred as much as possible, while those that cannot be transferred are processed locally, and sales channels are actively sought. The supply work has also changed from the previous uniform approach of not being thorough or analytical. Attention is paid to organizing the supply of materials according to the characteristics of the mountainous areas. In the future, in addition to expanding the operation of ready-made medicines to meet the needs of the people in the mountainous areas, ethnic commodity stores will be gradually established in areas where ethnic minorities are relatively concentrated, specifically responsible for supplying the commodities needed by ethnic minorities. In areas where Hui people live and along major transportation routes, Hui canteens and Hui non-staple food stores will be established to ensure the living needs of the Hui people.
    Regarding price issues, the current price level of industrial products in county towns will remain unchanged, and the current price difference between county towns and primary markets will be eliminated, with only transportation and miscellaneous expenses maintained. To encourage private merchants to supply goods to the countryside, a slight price difference may be allowed in areas that are far away and cannot be returned to on the same day. For individual high mountain areas, arrangements will be made in the spirit of not losing or making money, with slightly higher prices for individual commodities, to take care of the lives of the people in the mountainous areas.
    For agricultural and sideline products, if they are needed for local supply, they will be processed locally to reduce selling prices. For those to be transported out, transportation and miscellaneous fees will be verified to overcome the past phenomenon of excessively high transportation and miscellaneous fees. The grading of products will also be simplified and clearly defined to avoid increasing the trouble for farmers and the phenomenon of some business cadres suppressing grades and prices. For example, for live pigs, the original system of five grades and fifteen levels was very troublesome for farmers. In the future, it will be changed to three grades: below 60 kilograms, 60-80 kilograms, and above 80 kilograms.
    Special care will also be given to the festivals of ethnic minorities. Slaughter tax will be exempted for livestock slaughtered for festivals, and the supply of grain for festivals will also be increased.
    In order to discover problems in a timely manner and ensure the financial and economic work in ethnic minority areas is done well, leading cadres of the financial and economic departments will go deep into the ethnic minority areas every quarter to understand the situation and arrange work.

    云南省曲靖专区采取积极措施
    改进民族地区的财经工作
    本报昆明29日电　云南省曲靖专区采取积极措施，改进民族地区的财经工作。
    在商业工作上，首先注意了加强山区农村土特产的收购工作，特别是山货药材及猪、牛、羊等畜产品，收购后能外调的尽量外调，不能外调的就在当地加工，再积极寻找销路。供应工作也改变了过去不深入、不分析、千篇一律的做法，注意根据山区特点来组织物资供应。今后除了要扩大成药的经营以满足山区群众的需要外，还在兄弟民族比较集中的地区，逐步成立民族商品门市部，专门负责供应兄弟民族所需要的商品；回族聚居区及交通要道，将成立回族食堂及回族副食品门市部，以保证回民生活上的需要。
    在价格问题上，工业品在县城现行价格水平不动的基础上，取消目前县城到初级市场的差价，当中只保持运杂费用；为了鼓励私商下乡供应，在路途较远当天不能往返的地区，可适当有一点差价；对个别高寨山区，则将本着不赔不赚的原则和个别商品略高的精神进行安排，以照顾山区人民的生活。
    农副业产品，如果是当地需要供应的，就在当地组织加工，以降低销价；要外运的，则采取运杂费核实的办法，克服过去运杂费偏高的现象；并将产品的等级简化，加以明确的规定，以免增加农民的麻烦及某些业务干部压级压价的现象。如毛猪，原分五等十五级，农民很觉麻烦，今后改为六十公斤以下、六十——八十公斤和八十公斤以上三等。
    兄弟民族的节日也将给以特殊的照顾，为节日而宰杀的牲口，免纳屠宰税，节日的粮食供应也将增加。
    为了能够及时发现问题，保证做好民族地区的财经工作，财经部门的领导干部，每一个季度都将深入到民族地区，具体了解情况，安排工作。
