    Organize Peak Season Supply Work According to This Year's Characteristics
    (Our Report) Jiangchuan County, Yunnan Province, specifically analyzed the characteristics of this year's peak season to prepare for peak season supply work. In the past, Jiangchuan County was caught off guard due to neglecting peak season supply work, resulting in stockouts. It also experienced overstocking and failure to meet plans due to vigorously developing sources of goods. This year, they learned from past lessons and adopted a method that combined calculating the overall situation with typical investigations to analyze the characteristics of the peak season. This year's peak season is characterized by: the earlier start of flue-cured tobacco by two seasons, with the purchasing bureau starting procurement in early August. The Jiangchuan County Party Committee has decided that agricultural cooperatives should sell tobacco and distribute income simultaneously. This means the peak season may arrive earlier. This year, farmers' living standards have improved, and the variety of commodities needed will also increase. Their overall calculation is: In agriculture, the county has 92,168 mu of flue-cured tobacco, producing 300 jin per mu, totaling over 27 million jin, worth 12.44 million yuan; 46,400 mu of rice, yielding 750 jin per mu, worth 2.18 million yuan; sideline production income is estimated at 2.92 million yuan; salary increases for cadres and other investments amount to 300,000 yuan. The total income is 17.84 million yuan, and after deducting public grain, rations, tobacco deposits, etc., totaling 10.68 million yuan, there is still 7.16 million yuan remaining as the purchasing power of the cooperatives and their members. This averages 55 yuan per person for purchasing means of production and living materials. They also helped cooperative members calculate their individual accounts. The Seventeenth Production Team of Sanjie Township has 59 households with 241 people, and the average purchasing power per person for the whole year is 91.86 yuan. This includes 31.21 yuan for food, 14.22 yuan for cotton cloth, 6.16 yuan for knitwear, 9.61 yuan for daily necessities, 4 yuan for means of production, 9 yuan for medicine, and 17.66 yuan for other items. During the investigation, they also learned about the specific commodities needed and, based on this, helped the Sanjie grassroots cooperative to formulate a specific purchase plan. Other grassroots cooperatives also conducted preliminary investigations and made purchase plans. Their specific methods for doing a good job in peak season supply are: (1) Propose a preliminary purchase plan based on clearing warehouses and taking stock. The Finance Committee organized the signing of purchase contracts totaling 1.63 million yuan, accounting for 38% of the peak season supply plan. (2) Organize procurement teams to purchase goods in advance. In July, eleven people were transferred from cooperatives and department stores, trade, knitting, textile, special sales, food, cultural goods, coal construction and other companies, to Kunming to expedite delivery. State-owned enterprises purchased goods that were operated by state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives purchased goods that were not stocked by state-owned stores. They used mutual consultation, supervision, and guarantees to ensure the supply of goods during the peak season. (3) Vigorously organize processing to enable farmers to wear ready-made clothes. This year, after the upsurge of cooperativization, farmers have high attendance rates and do not have time to sew clothes and make shoes. They processed more than 25,000 pieces of clothing, trousers, hats, shoes, cotton wadding, etc. in the county; in addition, they ordered more than 59,000 pieces in Kunming, most of which can be shipped to Jiangchuan by the end of August. With these sources of goods, during the peak season, they can only be busy selling goods, and will not be like last year, where farmers had to wait three months to have clothes to wear after buying cloth. During the peak season, according to last year's method, an internal exchange meeting is held every half month to one month to further ensure that commodities are suitable and timely. In response to the above situation, they also trained a group of temporary salespersons.

    根据今年特点组织旺季供应工作
    本报讯　云南省江川县具体分析今年旺季特点，准备旺季供应工作。江川县过去因为忽视了旺季供应工作而手忙脚乱，造成脱销；也曾经因为大力开展货源而造成积压，完不成计划。今年，他们接受过去的教训，采取算大账和典型调查相结合的办法，分析了旺季特点。今年旺季特点是：烤烟提前了两个节令，采购局于八月上旬即开始收购。江川县委已决定农业社要一面卖烟、一面分配。这样旺季就可能提前到来。今年农民生活水平提高了，商品品种也就需要增加。他们算的大账是：农业方面，全县烤烟92，168亩，每亩产300斤，共2，700多万斤，值1，244万元；稻谷46，400亩，每亩750斤，值218万元；副业生产收入估计有292万元；干部增加工资和其他投放30万元。以上共收入1，784万元，除去公粮、口粮、烤烟定金等共1，068万元，还剩716万元作为社和社员的购买力。这样平均每人有55元购买生产资料和生活资料。他们还帮助社员算了小账。三街乡第十七生产队有五十九户241人，全年平均每人购买力为91.86元。其中购买食品31.21元，花纱布14.22元，针棉织品6.16元，日用百货9.61元，生产资料4元，医药9元，其他17.66元。在调查中还摸到他们需要的具体商品，并在这个基础上帮助三街基层社做出具体进货计划。其他各基层社也进行了初步调查，做出进货计划。他们做好旺季供应工作的具体办法是：（1）在清仓库排队的基础上提出初步的进货计划，由财委会组织签订进货合同协议163万元，占旺季供应计划的38％。（2）组织要货组提前进货。七月份抽调合作社及百货、贸易、针织、纺织、专卖、食品、文化用品、煤建等公司共十一人，到昆明催货。凡是国营经营购进的由国营进，国营商店不进的由合作社进。他们用互相商量，督促，保证旺季货源供应。（3）大力组织加工，使农民穿现成衣服。今年合作化高潮到来后，农民出勤率高，没有时间缝衣服做鞋子，他们在本县加工了衣、裤、帽、鞋、棉絮等共两万五千多件；另外又在昆明订了五万九千多件，八月底可以大部运到江川。有了这些货源，旺季就可以只忙卖货，不会像去年一样农民买了布要三个月后才有衣穿。在旺季中照去年办法，每半月到一月开一次内部交流会，进一步使商品对路和及时。针对上述情况，他们还训练了一批临时售货员。
