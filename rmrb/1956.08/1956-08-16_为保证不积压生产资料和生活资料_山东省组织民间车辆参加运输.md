Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th. Shandong Province's transportation departments are vigorously organizing civilian transportation tools to participate in local transportation, in order to solve the current difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity.

With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, Shandong Province's road transportation volume has greatly increased. According to the Transportation Department's existing transportation capacity calculations, more than two million tons of goods will be backlogged in the second half of this year due to insufficient vehicles. The vast majority of these are grain, coal, salt, and various agricultural production materials and basic construction equipment.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to the above situation. They believe that it is necessary to adopt the method of organizing and leveraging the potential of civilian transportation to overcome the current difficulty of insufficient state transportation tools and complete transportation tasks. According to relevant departments' investigations, agricultural cooperatives across the province currently own approximately 430,000 rubber-wheeled and iron/wooden-wheeled carts, as well as more than 1.05 million handcarts. If these tools are mobilized, they can transport 14 million tons of materials per month. As long as a portion of these transportation tools are organized to participate in sideline transportation, the problem of material backlog throughout the province can be solved. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives can also receive substantial freight fees, increasing the income of cooperative members.

In order to strengthen leadership in this work, the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation held a meeting of transportation section chiefs from various special districts and some counties from August 8th to 11th, to discuss and formulate the "Provisional Organizational Regulations for County Transportation Management Stations" and the "Provisional Measures for County Transportation Management Stations to Organize and Manage Agricultural Cooperative Sideline Vehicles."

Currently, the work of mobilizing and organizing civilian transportation tools has begun throughout the province. Some counties have already established specialized agencies to manage this work—Transportation Management Stations—and have begun conducting surveys, registration, and grouping of civilian transportation tools. It is expected that in August and September, various localities will complete organizational preparations, and by the beginning of the fourth quarter, a large number of civilian vehicles will be organized to participate in the busy post-autumn transportation work.

    为保证不积压生产资料和生活资料
    山东省组织民间车辆参加运输
    新华社济南14日电　山东省交通运输部门，正在大力组织民间运输工具参加地方运输，以便解决当前运输力量不足的困难。
    随着工农业生产的迅速发展，山东省的公路运输量大为增加。根据交通厅现有的运输能力计算，今年下半年要有二百多万吨待运物资将因车辆不足而形成积压。其中绝大部分是粮食、煤炭、食盐以及各种农业生产资料和基本建设器材。
    中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会对上述情况都极为重视。认为必须采取组织发挥民间运输潜力的办法，来克服当前国家运输工具不足的困难，完成运输任务。据有关部门调查，目前全省各地农业社共拥有胶轮和铁、木轮大车约四十三万多辆，另外还有一百零五万多辆手推车。这些工具动用起来每月能够运输一千四百万吨物资。只要把其中的一部分运输工具组织起来参加副业运输，全省物资积压的问题就可以解决。同时在农业社方面，也可以因此得到巨额的运费，增加社员的收入。
    为了加强对这项工作的领导，山东省交通厅在八月八日到十一日，召开各专署和部分县交通科长会议，讨论和制定了“县运输管理站暂行组织章程”和“县运输管理站组织管理农业社副业车辆暂行办法”。
    目前，发动和组织民间运输工具的工作已经在全省各地开始进行。有些县已经建立了管理这一工作的专门机构——运输管理站，并且开始进行民间运输工具的调查、登记和编组编队等工作。预计在八、九两月份内，各地做好组织准备工作，到第四季度开始的时候，各地就将有大批民间车辆有组织地投入秋后繁忙的运输工作。
