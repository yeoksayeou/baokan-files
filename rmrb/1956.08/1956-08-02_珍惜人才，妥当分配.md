    Cherish Talent, Allocate Appropriately

    This summer, over 60,000 university graduates nationwide will participate in national construction work. Due to the rapid development of China's socialist transformation and socialist construction, the country is in urgent need of technical personnel in all fields. Therefore, the contradiction between the supply and demand of university graduates this year is more prominent than in previous years. According to incomplete statistics from various central departments and local areas, they need more than 190,000 university graduates this year, more than three times the actual number of graduates. In some individual majors, the demand is more than ten times the number of graduates. The number of graduates this summer is far from meeting the needs of the country, which requires us to cherish talent and allocate it appropriately.

    The work allocation plan for this year's university graduates is formulated based on the principles of meeting national needs, centralized use, prioritized allocation, and general consideration, combined with the principle of aligning learning with application. The allocation plan prioritizes the needs of scientific research, university faculty, and industrial departments (especially foreign-designed construction projects); it also gives appropriate consideration to other departments in urgent need and to the needs of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government.

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the conference on intellectual issues, the Party committees in various regions and departments have strengthened their leadership over the work of intellectuals. However, are there no problems with the allocation and utilization of university graduates? No. We can see from the following situation: From January to May this year, the Ministry of Higher Education received 1,606 letters from university graduates requesting job adjustments after the job allocation was announced. Among them, the largest number, 735 people, accounting for 45% of the total letters, reflected unreasonable utilization; 368 people, accounting for 23% of the total letters, requested consideration for physical weakness, family difficulties, and spousal relationships. Many facts reflected in the graduates' letters indicate that some units did not allocate graduates' jobs according to the principle of "aligning learning with application," wasting talent, and did not adequately consider the graduates' actual difficulties. For example, one department once assigned some surveying graduates to work in construction units, resulting in these graduates being "idle and bored," while on the other hand, the department's surveying units urgently needed surveying personnel but could not be satisfied. Some units only considered work needs when formulating graduate allocation plans, and rarely considered the graduates' majors. Furthermore, some departments excessively assigned recent graduates to work in upper-level administrative management organs. Obviously, these unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and utilization of graduates are very detrimental to our cause.

    The reasons for these phenomena are mainly due to bureaucracy and departmentalism in some employing departments. They usually do not understand the actual needs of their subordinate units, nor do they specifically study the professional uses of these graduates. When allocating graduates, they subjectively and irresponsibly allocate graduates' jobs casually. In addition, some comrades do not see that university graduates are the new force in China's intellectual community and the reserve force of experts. They do not understand the importance of cherishing talent and treat the allocation of graduates as a routine matter. Therefore, correcting the irresponsible behavior of these people, requiring them to seriously value talent, and properly allocating graduates' jobs is an extremely important issue at present.

    Now, the State Council has issued the "Instructions on the Unified Allocation of University Graduates Nationwide in the Summer of 1956." The instructions stipulate effective measures to address the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena.

    The State Council's instructions stipulate that, in the future, the employing departments and personnel departments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should establish a regular inspection system for the allocation and utilization of university graduates. Unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and utilization of university graduates should be seriously and responsibly adjusted, and graduates should be reassigned to suitable jobs. Therefore, if some units do not need or do not have jobs suitable for graduates' majors, they should actively request adjustments from higher-level departments. Do not "accept it and be content with it," and hold on to the idea of "preparing for a rainy day" by "stockpiling" graduates. Furthermore, do not treat graduates who request job adjustments with labels such as "This was allocated by the higher-level organization," "Work needs it," or "Requesting job adjustment is individualism."

    In order to better implement the rational allocation and utilization of university graduates, the State Council's instructions also clearly state that the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should regularly inspect and supervise the allocation and utilization of university graduates in this summer. If they discover any unreasonable allocation and utilization, such as using graduates in fields unrelated to their majors or arbitrarily forcing them to change careers, they have the right to propose reallocation opinions to the Ministry of Higher Education or relevant employing departments or the State Council, and these relevant departments will arrange their work separately. If university graduates themselves believe that the allocation is inappropriate or the utilization is improper, they can also submit opinions on reallocation of work to the relevant departments mentioned above. This method also applies to university graduates who were allocated jobs in previous years. In this way, by strengthening inspection and supervision on the one hand and fully promoting democracy on the other, it is possible to ensure that the graduate allocation work is done well.

    When considering the allocation of graduate jobs, the relevant personnel departments, schools, and business departments in various regions should implement the principle of "using local materials" and take into account the regionality of graduates. When possible, reasonable and reasonable consideration should also be given to graduates' physical, family, and other practical difficulties and spousal relationships, which will enable them to work with peace of mind and give full play to their enthusiasm.

    Of course, it should also be considered that when our motherland is carrying out large-scale socialist construction, some graduates, due to work needs or the special nature of their work, cannot completely solve all the difficulties at once, nor can they completely satisfy their requirements for the allocation area. In this case, we believe that these graduates will be able to understand the difficulties of the country, obey the needs of the motherland, and happily embark on their work posts.

    In order to do a good job in the allocation of university graduates, all employing departments, local personnel departments, and universities should earnestly implement the instructions of the State Council, and Party committees at all levels should also give due specific guidance and supervision to the graduate allocation work.

    Graduating students who have been educated by the Party and the state for many years, you are about to leave school happily and embark on glorious work posts. You will apply your theoretical knowledge to practical work and serve the socialist construction cause of the motherland under the great call to march towards science. I wish you to combine theory well with practice, study hard at your work posts, improve your thinking, diligently study your profession, and shoulder increasingly important construction tasks.

### 珍惜人才，妥当分配

    珍惜人才，妥当分配
    今年暑假，全国将有六万多名高等学校毕业生参加国家建设工作。由于我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，国家各方面需要技术人才非常迫切，所以今年高等学校毕业生供求矛盾比往年更加突出。根据中央各部门和各地方提出数字的不完全统计，他们需要今年高等学校毕业生约十九万多人，为实际毕业生人数的三倍多，其中个别专业毕业生竟相差十几倍。今年暑假毕业生人数远远不足国家的需要，这就要求我们更加珍惜人才，妥当分配。
    今年暑假高等学校毕业生的工作分配计划，是根据国家需要、集中使用、重点配备和一般照顾的方针，并且结合学用一致的原则来拟制的。分配计划尽先照顾了科学研究、高等学校的师资、工业部门（特别是国外设计的建设项目）的需要；对其他部门在迫切需要的情况下也给予了适当的照顾；对各省、自治区、直辖市的需要也作了适当的照顾。
    自从中共中央召开关于知识分子问题的会议以后，各地和各部门的党委，对知识分子工作的领导是加强了。可是，对于高等学校毕业生的分配和使用上是不是已经没有什么问题了呢？不是的。我们可以从下面的情况来看：今年一月到五月，高等教育部收到高等学校毕业生分配工作以后，要求调整工作的1，606人的来信，其中以反映使用不合理的为最多，计有735人，占来信总人数的45％；要求照顾身体病弱、家庭困难和爱人关系的368人，占来信总人数的23％。从毕业生来信中反映的许多事实，说明有些单位没有按照“学用一致”的原则分配毕业生的工作，浪费了人才；对毕业生实际困难的照顾不够。例如，有一个部门就曾经把一部分学测量的毕业生分配在施工单位去工作，以致这些毕业生“闲得发慌”，而另一方面这个部门的所属勘测单位急需测量人员却未能满足。有的单位在制定配备毕业生计划的时候仅仅根据工作需要，而很少考虑毕业生所学的专业。还有的部门把刚离开学校的毕业生过多地分配在上层行政管理机关工作。显然，这些对毕业生分配和使用不合理的现象，对我们的事业都是非常不利的。
    产生这些现象的原因，主要是由于某些用人部门存在着官僚主义和本位主义。他们平素对所属单位的实际需要并不了解，也不具体研究这些毕业生所学的专业用途。到分配毕业生的时候，他们就主观地不负责任地随便分配毕业生的工作。此外，有些同志看不见高等学校毕业生是我国知识界的新生力量，是专家的后备军这样一个重要的事实。他们不懂得珍惜人才，把分配毕业生的工作当做例行公事。因此，纠正这些人的不负责任现象，要他们认真地重视人才，把毕业生的工作分配妥当，是当前极其重要的问题。
    现在，国务院发出了“关于1956年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示”。指示中针对上面这些不合理现象，规定了有效的措施。
    国务院指示规定，今后各用人部门和省、自治区、直辖市人事部门对高等学校毕业生的分配和使用，应该建立经常的检查制度，对高等学校毕业生分配和使用不合理的现象，应认真负责地给予调整，重新分配给毕业生以合适的工作。因此，有的单位如果不需要或没有适合毕业生所学专业的工作，就应该主动请求上级部门调整。不要“既来之、则安之”，抱着“有备无患”的想法，把毕业生“储备”起来。更不能以“这是上级组织分配来的”、“工作需要”、“要求调整工作是个人主义”等等大帽子对待要求调整工作的毕业生。
  　为了更好地贯彻合理分配和使用高等学校毕业生，国务院的指示又明确地提出，省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会对本届暑期全国高等学校毕业生的分配和使用，应经常予以检查和监督，如果发现有分配和使用不合理，如用非所学、任意使他们改行等现象，有权向高等教育部或者有关使用部门或者国务院提出重新调配的意见，由这些有关的部门另行安排他们的工作。高等学校毕业生本人如果认为分配不当或者使用不当的时候，也可以向上面所说的有关部门提出重新分配工作的意见。这一办法同样也适用于前几年分配的高等学校毕业生。这样，一方面加强检查和监督，一方面充分发扬民主，就有可能保证把毕业生分配工作做好。
    各地有关人事部门、学校和业务部门在考虑分配毕业生工作的时候，应当贯彻“就地取材”的原则，照顾毕业生的地区性。对毕业生的身体、家庭等实际困难和爱人关系，在可能的情况下也要尽可能地给予合情合理的照顾，这会使他们安心工作，并且发挥他们的积极性。
    当然，也应该考虑到，当我们祖国正在进行大规模的社会主义建设事业的时候，有的毕业生由于工作需要或工作性质特殊，还不能一下子完全合理地解决一切困难的问题，还不能完全满足自己对于分配地区的要求。在这种情况下，我们相信这些毕业同学一定能够体谅国家的困难，服从祖国的需要，愉快地走上工作岗位。
    为了做好高等学校毕业生的分配工作，各用人部门，各地人事部门和各高等学校应当认真地执行国务院的指示，各级党委对毕业生分配工作也应当给予应有的具体指导和监督。
    受到党和国家多年教育的毕业同学们，你们就要愉快地离开学校走上光荣的工作岗位，你们将要把自己的理论知识运用到实际工作中去，在伟大的向科学进军的号召下，为祖国的社会主义建设事业而服务。祝你们把理论很好地同实际相结合，在工作岗位上努力学习，提高思想，刻苦钻研业务，担负起越来越重大的建设任务。
