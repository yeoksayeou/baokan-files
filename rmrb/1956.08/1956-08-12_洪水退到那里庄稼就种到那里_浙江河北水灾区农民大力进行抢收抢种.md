Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th. After the strong typhoon, Zhejiang is seizing the time to vigorously carry out emergency harvesting and planting to quickly restore agricultural production.

In the counties of the Jinhua Special District, where early-season crops were planted before the typhoon but not yet harvested, the vast number of farmers have been working for days to harvest more than one million mu of early-season crops and plant late rice, corn, and other autumn crops. Now, many agricultural cooperatives are nervously beginning to harvest mid-season rice. Members of five agricultural cooperatives in Xiayu Township, Lanxi County, are harvesting 400 mu of mid-season rice. The typhoon blew a lot of grain off in some fields. Male members are cutting rice in the front, and female members are sweeping up the blown-off grain in the back. In Andi Township, Jinhua County, some rice fields were flooded, and after the water receded, the fields were mixed with weeds and rocks. On the 3rd, the men and women of the township were cutting, washing, and drying at the same time. They harvested more than 62 dan of grain and cleared more than 2 dan of weeds in one day.

In the coastal Wenzhou Special District of southern Zhejiang, which was less affected by the typhoon, more than 500,000 mu of continuous cropping of late rice had not been transplanted due to drought at the end of July. After the typhoon, the counties urgently mobilized the masses to rush to plant. Huangyan, Yueqing, Yuhuan, and other counties have now finished emergency planting. The entire area is expected to finish emergency planting of all continuous cropping of late rice in the next few days.

The Ningbo Special District, which was more severely affected by the disaster along the coast, is also rushing to plant autumn crops such as continuous cropping of late rice and autumn corn. Linhai County has already planted 130,000 mu of continuous cropping of late rice by the 7th. Shaoxing County has planted more than 90% of its 370,000 mu of continuous cropping of late rice, and replanting of miscellaneous grain crops damaged by the typhoon in the mountainous areas is also underway. Farmers in Shangyu County on both banks of the Cao'e River immediately began to support seedlings and rush to plant as soon as the floodwaters receded. Many farmers proposed, "Plant crops wherever the floodwaters recede." In Zhangzhen Township, more than 100 mu of land had not been planted with continuous cropping of late rice. On the 5th, after the floodwaters receded on the 4th, a patch of green seedlings appeared in this field.

Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has allocated another 6 million yuan in loans to help farmers in disaster-stricken areas overcome production and living difficulties. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently transferred 4.86 million jin of chemical fertilizer from Shanghai to support farmers in disaster-stricken areas in restoring production.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th. Farmers in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei Province are not only rushing to block breaches, but also actively draining water, rescuing early-maturing crops, and rush-planting late-autumn crops.

After the river water within the territory of Xushui County in the Baoding Special District began to recede, farmers in more than 140 disaster-stricken villages throughout the county are, under the leadership of county and district cadres, blocking breaches and opening canals in the flooded land to drain water and rescue crops that have been washed down. As of the 7th, the county had drained accumulated water from more than 140,000 mu of land. Farmers in Dukou District, Shahe County, have completely drained accumulated water from more than 6,000 mu of corn and millet land. Members of the Balimiao Agricultural Cooperative have sown late-autumn crops such as buckwheat and vegetables on more than 1,000 mu of land where accumulated water has been drained.

Farmers in the eastern regions and counties located in the lower reaches of various rivers are also rationally organizing labor, intensifying flood prevention and draining water. In order to timely drain the accumulated water from more than 1,000 mu of flooded rice fields, agricultural cooperatives in five townships including Lizhuang Village, Gaozhuangzi, and Wantou in Jinghai County organized more than 600 members to widen and deepen the original two drainage ditches, quickly draining all the accumulated water and ensuring the normal growth of more than 1,000 mu of rice.

    洪水退到那里庄稼就种到那里
    浙江河北水灾区农民大力进行抢收抢种
    新华社杭州9日电　强台风过后，浙江各地正抓紧时机大力进行抢收抢种，迅速恢复农业生产。
    在台风前早种作物未及收完的金华专区各县，广大农民连日来已把一百多万亩早种作物抢收完毕，并种下了晚稻、玉米等秋季作物。现在许多农业社又紧张地开始抢收中稻了。兰溪县下余乡五个农业社的社员正在抢收四百亩中稻，有些田里被台风吹落了很多谷子，男社员在前面割稻，女社员就在后面把吹落的谷子扫起来。金华县安地乡有些被洪水淹了的稻田，水退后田里夹杂着许多杂草和石块，这个乡的男女社员在三日那天，一面割，一面洗，一面晒，一天就收割了六十二担多谷子，还清除了二担多杂草。
    受台风影响较轻的浙南沿海温州专区各县，在七月底原有五十多万亩连作晚稻因旱没有插下去，台风过后，各县就紧急发动群众抢种。现在黄岩、乐清、玉环等县已抢种结束，全区预计在最近几天内可以把连作晚稻全部抢种完毕。
    沿海受灾较重的宁波专区，也正在抢种连作晚稻、秋玉米等秋季作物。临海县十三万亩连作晚稻，七日已经抢种下去。绍兴县三十七万亩连作晚稻已种下90％以上，山区被台风伤毁的杂粮作物，也正在补种。曹娥江两岸的上虞县农民在洪水一下退就投入扶苗抢种工作，很多农民提出“洪水退到那里就把庄稼种到那里”。章镇乡原有一百多亩田没有种上连作晚稻，四日大水退后，五日这一片田里就出现了一片青苗。
    最近，中国人民银行浙江省分行又增拨了六百万元贷款，帮助受灾地区农民克服生产和生活困难。省供销合作社最近从上海调来四百八十六万斤化学肥料，支援受灾地区农民恢复生产。
    新华社保定9日电　河北省水灾地区农民一面紧张抢堵决口，一面积极排水，抢救早熟作物和抢种晚秋作物。
    保定专区徐水县境内的河水开始下落后，全县一百四十多个受灾村庄的农民，正在县区干部的领导下，一面堵口一面在洪水淹了的地里开渠排水，抢救被水冲倒的庄稼。到七日止，全县已在十四万多亩地里排泄了积水。沙河县渡口区的农民已把六千多亩玉米、谷子地里的积水全部排出。八里庙农业社的社员们在排出积水的一千多亩土地上播种了荞麦、蔬菜等晚秋作物。
    位于各河下游的东部地区各县农民，也合理地组织劳动力，一面加紧防汛，一面进行排水。静海县李庄村、高庄子、湾头等五个乡的农业社，为了及时排出一千多亩被淹稻田里的积水，组织了六百多名社员对原有的两条排水支渠进行了加宽、挖深，很快将积水全部排出，保住了一千多亩稻子的正常生长。
