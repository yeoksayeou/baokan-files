    Hail to You, Suez Canal!
    Wang Qiu
    Suez Canal, Suez Canal, I have long heard you telling: In the previous century, the people on the banks of the Nile, in droves, passed by the pyramids, it was their one hundred and twenty thousand souls, that earned you a life. Unfortunately, you were seized as soon as you were born, intruders trampled and ravaged your spine. Your sheep saw the waves reflecting the shadows of foreign knives, unable to swallow the green grass by the river, the camels heard the pirate's whistle, unable to shake the copper bells on their necks.
    Suez Canal, Suez Canal, for a whole century, you stirred with red waves of blood and tears, you suffered enough pain, moaning. You cherish six thousand years of culture, you cannot be separated from the two banks. I finally heard your roar, like a thunderbolt in spring, shaking off the blue flag on the building, your intense and merciless electric fire, burning the colonizers' eyebrows, making them so ashamed, and so shocked!
    Suez Canal, Suez Canal, all of ancient Egypt is laughing, whether it's camels, sheep, or the Sphinx. Tractors are about to pass by you, because you want to repay the Nile. You proudly become a conduit to peace, connecting the East and the West on your body.
    Suez Canal, I salute you, Suez Canal!

    我向你致敬，苏彝士运河！
    王秋苏彝士运河，苏彝士运河，我久久地听到你在叙说：前一个世纪，尼罗河岸的人民，成群地从金字塔旁经过，是他们的十二万灵魂，换来了你一条生命。不幸你生下来就被人霸占，闯入者踩在你脊梁上蹂躏。你们的羊群看到映着外国刀影的波涛，咽不下河边的青草，骆驼听到海盗的汽笛声，摇不响它颈上的铜铃。苏彝士运河，苏彝士运河，整整一个世纪，你激荡着血泪的红波，你受够了苦痛，呻吟。你珍惜着六千年的文化，你不能和两岸分开。我终于听到你的吼声，像一声春天的霹雳，震落了大厦上的蓝旗，你那强烈无情的电火，烧着了殖民者的眉毛，使他们这样羞恼，而又这样的震惊！苏彝士运河，苏彝士运河，古埃及一切在欢笑，无论是骆驼、羊，还是人面狮身像。拖拉机就要从你身旁走过，因为你要报答尼罗河。你骄傲的成为通向和平的孔道，把东西方联结在你的身上。苏彝士运河，我向你致敬，苏彝士运河！
