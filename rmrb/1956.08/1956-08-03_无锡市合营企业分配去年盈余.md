Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 1st. Nearly a thousand joint public-private enterprises in Wuxi have distributed their 1955 profits according to the "Four Horses Divide the Spoils" principle. Private shareholders received a total of more than 2.5 million yuan in dividends, accounting for over 20% of the total profits. Some enterprises also paid supplementary dividends for 1953 and 1954 to private shareholders.

All thirteen cotton textile factories in the city made profits in 1955. Before the joint venture, the Shenxin No. 3 Textile Factory had been losing money for several years. After the implementation of the joint public-private partnership on August 1, 1954, it made a profit of 1,989,000 yuan within five months. In 1955, the profit was nearly 2.6 million yuan. After consultation between the public and private parties, the private party received 570,000 yuan in dividends. The Wuxi-Chengjiang Automobile Company's 1955 profit was equivalent to 53% of the company's total capital. From the implementation of the joint public-private partnership in January 1953 to the end of last year, the company's profits were more than twice the company's total capital. During these three years, the dividends received by private shares were equivalent to 36% of the total private share capital.

    无锡市合营企业分配去年盈余
    新华社南京1日电　无锡市近千户公私合营企业根据“四马分肥”原则，分配了1955年的盈余。私股股东共分得股息红利二百五十多万元，占盈余总数20％以上。有些企业还同时向私股股东补发了1953年和1954年的股息红利。
    全市十三家棉纺工厂，1955年都有盈余。申新第三纺织厂在合营以前几年，一直是亏损，1954年8月1日实行公私合营以后，在五个月内就盈余一百九十八万九千元。1955年盈余近二百六十万元，经公私双方协商，私方分得股息红利五十七万元。锡澄汽车公司1955年的盈余相当于企业资本总额的53％。这个公司从1953年1月实行公私合营到去年底，获得的盈余比企业资本总额多两倍以上。这三年中，私股分得的股息红利相当于私股资本总额的36％。
