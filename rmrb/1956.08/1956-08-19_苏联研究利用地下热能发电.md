Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 18th: A Soviet Academy of Sciences expedition team exploring geothermal energy in Kamchatka is studying the possibility of using geothermal energy to generate electricity. The Soviet Union's first industrial experimental power station using natural steam will soon be built there.

Academician Shebakov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently answered questions from a reporter from "Red Star Newspaper" on this topic. He said that geothermal energy is a new type of energy source that heats and mineralizes underground water, causing it to emerge as geysers and hot springs. Some hot springs eject steam with temperatures as high as several hundred degrees, and some geysers periodically erupt boiling water dozens of meters high. Most hot springs and geysers discharge steam and water with temperatures of 85 to 100 degrees Celsius or even higher. Water at this temperature can be used to heat cities and villages, and steam can be extracted from the ground through drilling to drive turbines and generate cheap electricity.

Many regions in the Soviet Union have such geysers and hot springs, with the largest number in the eastern regions. In Kamchatka, this energy is particularly abundant. Hot springs are distributed in groups there, with approximately one hundred groups. Their temperatures are all above 100 degrees Celsius, and they can supply one million liters of boiling water per day.

Soviet scientists are studying the Pauzhetka hot springs, where natural conditions are particularly suitable for using geothermal steam for power purposes.

Shebakov also said that large-scale industrial construction is currently underway in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. Therefore, rationally utilizing the geothermal energy there to serve the construction effort will be of great significance.

    苏联研究利用地下热能发电
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　在堪察加考察地下热能的苏联科学院考察队正在研究用地下热能发电的可能性。苏联第一座利用天然蒸气的工业试验性发电站不久将在那里建成。
    苏联科学院谢巴科夫院士最近答复了“红星报”记者提出的有关这方面的问题。他说，地下热是一种新的能源，它把地下水加热和矿化，并且使地下水变成间歇喷泉和温泉而喷出地面。有些温泉喷出了温度高达数百度的蒸气，有些间歇喷泉定期喷出的沸水高达几十公尺。而大多数温泉和喷泉所喷出地面的蒸气和水，具有八十五度到一百度甚至一百度以上的温度。这样温度的水可以用来使城市和乡村暖气化，蒸气可以用钻井引出地面来推动涡轮机发出廉价的电力。
    苏联的很多地区都有这种间歇喷泉和温泉，其中以东部地区最多。而在堪察加，这种能源特别丰富。那里的温泉成群地分布，大约有一百群。它们的温度都在一百度以上，每天可以供应一百万公升沸水。
    苏联科学家正在研究帕乌热特卡的温泉，那里的自然条件特别适合于把地下蒸气用于动力方面。
    谢巴科夫还说，目前苏联东部地区正在进行大规模的工业建设。因此，合理地利用那里的地下热能来为建设事业服务将有重大的意义。
