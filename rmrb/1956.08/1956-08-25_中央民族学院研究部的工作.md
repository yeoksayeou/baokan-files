    Work of the Research Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities
    Su Keqin
    The Research Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities was established in September 1952. The task of the Research Department is to study the problems of China's ethnic minorities, as well as the languages, scripts, history, culture, social economy of the various ethnic minorities, to promote and introduce the excellent history and culture of the various ethnic groups. This was stipulated in the trial plan for the establishment of the Central Institute for Nationalities approved by the former Government Administration Council. Scientific research on ethnic minorities is a relatively weak sector in China's scientific research field. In order to realize the Party's tasks in the nationalities issue during the transition period, to help ethnic minorities develop political, economic, cultural, and educational construction, and to gradually transition to a socialist society, it is very necessary to vigorously strengthen scientific research on ethnic minorities.

    Over the past four years, the comrades of the Research Department have conducted preliminary collation and research on historical materials of some ethnic minorities, conducted some investigations and research on the social conditions in ethnic minority areas, and assisted national work organs in researching some ethnic identification issues. At the same time, some research work has been carried out in translating Soviet theoretical works on nationality issues, compiling teaching materials on the history and national conditions of certain ethnic minorities, and collecting and exhibiting ethnic minority cultural relics. In these tasks, the research staff have written some research papers, monographs, and materials, some of which have been printed and distributed to relevant units for reference.

    In carrying out the above-mentioned work, the comrades of the Research Department have gained some experience.

    The research staff of the Research Department are able to regularly participate in the practical activities of national work, receive direct leadership and assistance from the Party and the government, learn the Party's ethnic policies and the Party's rich experience in ethnic work, and at the same time, have better opportunities and conditions to study Marxism-Leninism's theory on nationality issues. This has not only increased the theoretical knowledge and practical experience of ethnic work for the research staff, but also enabled them to correct old academic ideological viewpoints from such learning and training, thereby embarking on the path of conducting scientific research on ethnic minorities in combination with the practice of ethnic work. This is an important experience and gain.

    The comrades of the Research Department have implemented the principle of integrating theory with practice in their work. The research topics they selected were all determined based on the actual needs of national work. For example, because the people of all ethnic groups in our country want to be able to read the history of their own ethnic group and a general history of China that correctly handles the historical relationships between the various ethnic groups, the Research Department is conducting research on the history of China's ethnic minorities and the historical relationships between the various ethnic groups in Chinese history. Furthermore, because the current national work requires a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the social conditions of ethnic minorities and the resolution of certain ethnic identification issues, the Research Department is conducting research on the social nature, cultural and living characteristics, and certain ethnic identification issues of the various ethnic minorities. Such research work not only meets the needs of national work but also promotes the development of this discipline. In particular, the discipline of ethnology, whose foundation was relatively weak in the past, has had its research content become relatively clear and rich through research combined with practice, and its name has also been preliminarily determined. In the past, some people neglected practice and always liked to go around in circles on the definition of this discipline; experience has proven that that has no positive significance for the development of this discipline.

    The comrades of the Research Department have paid attention to the connections and cooperation between various disciplines in their work. For example, history has absorbed materials from ethnology, ethnology has received the help of history and linguistics, and some work, such as the research on ethnic identification, has adopted a comprehensive research method combining several disciplines. In addition, the research staff of the Research Department in all aspects have paid attention to the method of conducting investigations and research in depth in ethnic minority areas. In the field of history, they have also paid attention to the work of extensively collecting, sorting, and compiling historical materials of ethnic minorities. The role of these research methods in promoting the development of these disciplines is very significant.

    Naturally, the scientific research work of the Research Department also has some shortcomings and even errors. For example, in the research on the social history of ethnic minorities, insufficient attention has been paid to the socio-economic structure and class relations; some research has revealed some erroneous ideas of bourgeois nationalism and erroneous theories of bourgeois ethnology. The comrades of the Research Department have already paid attention to these problems and are working hard to overcome them.

    The Central Institute for Nationalities has always adopted a cautious attitude in its publishing work. However, in the past, there was a period when we did not actively edit and publish the papers, monographs, and materials that could be printed and distributed in a timely manner. This shortcoming has only been corrected in the past year.

    In the past six months, some comrades of the Research Department have participated in the drafting of the twelve-year plan for scientific research on domestic ethnic issues and the history and languages of ethnic minorities, exchanged experiences with experts from relevant fields, and further clarified the direction and important issues of research. The implementation of the Party's resolution on the issue of intellectuals and the call for the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy have greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of the comrades of the Research Department and promoted the development of research work.

    From July 2nd to 4th of this year, our institute convened a scientific discussion meeting, specifically to discuss some research papers proposed by the comrades of the Research Department. Among these papers, some were general discussions on the research of ethnic minority history and ethnology, some discussed the social nature, development, changes, and historical periodization of ethnic minorities, some evaluated historical figures of ethnic minorities, some discussed ethnic identification issues, and some discussed the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities. More than 140 people participated in this meeting, including responsible comrades from relevant units and more than 40 experts in history, archaeology, ethnology, linguistics, and other fields. The meeting conducted a heated discussion on the above-mentioned papers, especially the research discussion on ethnic identification issues was the most heated, mainly discussing how to conduct specific analysis and research based on Marxist-Leninist theory on nationality issues and China's actual conditions, and the Party's ethnic policies. Different opinions were debated on several arguments put forward in some papers, such as the Uygur people having crossed the slavery stage in history, the Tibetan people being a slave society during the Tubo period, the Manchu people being a slave society during the Nurhaci period, the Daur people originating from the Khitan, and the "Tai" language not belonging to the Sino-Tibetan language family.

    Many comrades emphasized in their speeches at the discussion meeting that in future scientific research on ethnic minorities, history, archaeology, ethnology, linguistics, as well as anthropology and geography, should closely cooperate. Everyone also unanimously proposed in the discussion that in carrying out scientific research on ethnic minorities, we must conscientiously criticize and overcome the ideological tendencies of Han chauvinism and local nationalism; in particular, we must conscientiously criticize and overcome the ideological tendencies of Han chauvinism.

    Recently, the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress has transferred more than 50 research staff from various fields such as history, archaeology, ethnology, linguistics, and literature and art from our institute's Research Department and other academic institutions, and sent them to ethnic minority areas to conduct social history surveys of ethnic minorities. Before this group of personnel departed, they concentrated at the Central Institute for Nationalities for two months of study and preparation work. This survey work is a large-scale comprehensive scientific research work on ethnic minorities. Through this survey work, better conditions will be created for future scientific research on ethnic minorities, and it will also be an important exercise for the comrades of our Research Department who are participating in this work.

    中央民族学院研究部的工作
    苏克勤
    中央民族学院研究部是在1952年九月成立的。研究部的任务是研究中国少数民族问题，以及各少数民族的语言文字、历史文化、社会经济，发扬并介绍各民族的优良历史文化。这是前政务院批准的筹办中央民族学院试行方案中规定的。关于少数民族的科学研究工作是我国科学研究领域中比较薄弱的部门。为了实现过渡时期党在民族问题方面的任务，帮助少数民族发展政治、经济、文化教育建设事业，逐步过渡到社会主义社会，大力加强关于少数民族的科学研究工作是十分必要的。
    四年来，研究部的同志们对一部分少数民族的史料进行了初步的整理和研究，对少数民族地区的社会情况做了些调查研究，并协助民族工作机关做了些族别问题的研究。同时，在翻译苏联关于民族问题的理论著作、编写某些少数民族历史和民族情况的教材以及搜集、展览少数民族文物等工作中，都进行了一些研究工作。在这些工作中，研究工作人员已经写出了一些研究论文、专著和资料，其中一部分已经印发有关单位参考。
    研究部的同志们在进行上述工作中，摸索到了一些经验。
    研究部的研究工作人员，能够经常参加民族工作的实际活动，得到党和政府的直接领导和帮助，学习党的民族政策和党在民族工作方面的丰富经验，同时在学习马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论方面，也有较好的机会和条件，这不仅使研究工作人员增长了民族工作的理论知识和实际经验，而且使他们能够从这样的学习和锻炼中纠正旧的学术思想观点，从而步入结合民族工作的实践开展关于少数民族的科学研究工作的轨道。这是一项重要的经验和收获。
    研究部同志们在工作中贯彻了理论联系实际的原则。他们选定的研究题目，都是根据民族工作的实际需要而确定的。如我国各族人民要求能够读到本民族的历史，和正确处理历史上各族的相互关系的中国通史，研究部就进行关于中国各少数民族历史和中国历史上各族的相互关系的研究；又如当前的民族工作需要全面系统地了解少数民族的社会情况，和解决某些族别问题，研究部就进行关于各少数民族的社会性质和文化、生活的特点及某些族别问题的研究。这样的研究工作，不但符合于民族工作的需要，而且推动了本门学科的发展。特别是民族学这门学科，以前的基础是比较薄弱的，但通过结合实践的研究，它的研究内容已经比较明确和丰富了，它的名称也初步确定了。过去有的人忽视实践，总喜欢在这门学科的定义问题上绕圈子；经验证明，那对本门学科的发展是没有什么积极意义的。
    研究部的同志们在工作中注意了各个学科之间的联系和配合。如历史学吸收了民族学的材料，民族学得到了历史学和语言学的帮助，而有些工作，如对于族别的研究，则采取了几个学科综合研究的方法。此外，研究部各方面的研究工作人员都注重深入少数民族地区进行调查研究的方法，在历史学方面，还注意大量搜集、整理、编纂少数民族史料的工作。采用这些研究方法，对于这些学科的发展的推动作用是很大的。
    自然，研究部的科学研究工作也还存在着一些缺点甚至错误。如关于少数民族社会历史的研究工作中，对社会经济结构和阶级关系注意不够；有的研究表露了一些资产阶级民族主义的错误思想和资产阶级民族学的错误理论。研究部的同志们对这些问题已经引起了注意，正在努力克服中。
    中央民族学院在出版工作方面，一向是采取慎重处理的态度。但是我们过去曾在一个时期里，没有积极地把可能印发的论文、专著和资料及时地予以编辑出版，这个缺点，近一年来才有所纠正。
    近半年来，研究部的部分同志参加了关于国内民族问题和少数民族历史、语言的科学研究十二年规划草案的制定工作，同有关方面的专家们交流了经验，进一步明确了研究的方向和重要问题。党关于知识分子问题会议的决议的贯彻，和“百家争鸣”政策的号召，更大大地鼓舞了研究部同志们的工作热情，促进了研究工作的发展。
    本年七月二日到四日的三天内，我院召开了科学讨论会，专门讨论研究部同志们提出的一些研究论文。这些论文中，有概论少数民族历史和民族学的研究的，有论述少数民族社会性质、发展变迁和历史分期问题的，有评价少数民族历史人物的，有论述族别问题的，也有论述少数民族语言文字问题的。参加这次会议的共有一百四十余人，其中有各有关单位的负责同志和历史学、考古学、民族学、语言学及其他方面专家四十余人。会议就上述论文展开了热烈的讨论，特别是对于族别问题的研究讨论最为热烈，主要是讨论如何依据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论和中国的实际情况、党的民族政策，具体地进行分析研究的问题。对一部分论文提出的若干论点，如维吾尔族在历史上曾跨越了奴隶制阶段、藏族在吐蕃时期是奴隶制社会、满族在努尔哈赤时期是奴隶制社会、达呼尔族来源于契丹、“台”语不属于汉藏语系等等，都展开了不同意见的争论。
    许多同志在讨论会的发言中都强调在今后关于少数民族的科学研究工作中，历史学、考古学、民族学、语言学以及人类学、地理学等都应密切配合和合作。大家在讨论中还一致提出：在开展关于少数民族的科学研究工作中，必须认真批判和克服大汉族主义和地方民族主义的思想倾向；尤其必须认真批判和克服大汉族主义思想倾向。
    最近，全国人民代表大会民族委员会从我院研究部和其他学术机关调集了历史学、考古学、民族学、语言学和文学艺术等各方面的研究工作人员五十余人，派赴少数民族地区进行少数民族社会历史调查工作。这批人员出发以前集中在中央民族学院进行了两个月的学习和准备工作。这次调查工作是一项规模很大的关于少数民族的综合的科学研究工作。经过这次调查工作，将为今后关于少数民族的科学研究工作创造更好的条件，对于我们研究部参加这项工作的同志们来说，也是一次重要的锻炼。
