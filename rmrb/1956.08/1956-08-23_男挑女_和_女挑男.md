    "Men Picking Women" and "Women Picking Men"
    Shu Wu
    For thousands of years in old China, men have been picking women, picking them as toys, picking them as tools, picking them as slaves, picking them as livestock, with extremely harsh conditions.
    Women were in a position of waiting to be picked. Men were still afraid that they might have different ambitions, so they simply laid down a rule: "Marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog."
    Of course, men in New China still have to pick women, but they are picking them as people like themselves. This is not a gift from men, but a position they have won for themselves. The evidence is that they also have legally guaranteed rights to pick men, and they also have various selection criteria.
    But those who have always been in the position of selectors are now being selected, so there is a lot of chattering. Female workers shouldn't not love male workers! Rural girls shouldn't not love rural young men! And it is said that this is a manifestation of their bourgeois hedonistic and corrupt thinking, which will hinder the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants, and is essentially a reflection of the complex and sharp class struggle during the transition period. What a heavy hat!
    But the chattering stream has not cited any examples to prove that their ideal lovers are capitalists, or that their ideal careers are as mistresses, and what is being criticized is nothing more than the fact that female workers often admire technicians and People's Liberation Army officers, and rural girls often admire workers, and so on. To be honest, I am very suspicious of the truthfulness of this situation. Even as it is said, I don't see anything wrong with it. If it is said that girls should not pick their own lovers, then there is no legal basis for it. If it is said that admiring workers, technicians, and People's Liberation Army officers is bourgeois hedonistic and corrupt thinking, then it is unreasonable. Remaining, there is only one reason, that is, they love not people, but material enjoyment, and they do not love people, but the hardship of industrial and agricultural production labor, and so on.
    I don't want to argue about some big principles, such as that today in our society all work is hard and glorious labor, and that improving personal material life on the basis of labor is a completely reasonable requirement, and that understanding the love of girls uniformly so vulgar just exposes the vulgarity of the understanders themselves, and so on. I just want to appeal for our new country: women also have the right to pick men, this is a good phenomenon that our new country will have, it should be applauded, it should be cheered. Even if their selection criteria are not yet perfect at the beginning, don't immediately use big hats to suppress them! As for some workers and peasants who are troubled by not being able to find a lover for a long time, their troubles deserve sympathy, and their production enthusiasm being affected is also understandable, but what is the reason why they have not found a lover, is it only because they are peasants and not workers, or workers and not technicians or officers? This is still worth studying, and it is especially worthy of self-reflection by those involved. "They don't love me, which is ruining my production." This is just the reverse side of the feudal "disaster water" theory, and today we don't need to say it again, right?

    “男挑女”和“女挑男”
    舒芜
    旧中国几千年来，男人一直在挑选女人，当作玩物来挑，当作工具来挑，当作奴隶来挑，当作牲畜来挑，条件非常繁苛。
    女人处在这样的地位静待挑选，男人们还惟恐她们或萌异志，干脆立下一条规矩：“嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗。
    新中国的男人当然还是要挑选女人，但是，是把她们当作和自己同样的人来挑。这并非出自男人的恩赐，而是她们自己争得了这个地位。证据是，她们也有了法律保障的权利来挑男人，也有了这样那样的挑选标准。
    但一向站在挑选者地位上的，这回也轮到被挑选，于是，嘁嘁喳喳之声起来了。女工不该不爱男工呀！农村姑娘不该不爱农村小伙子呀！而且据说这就是她们资产阶级享乐腐化思想的表现，会妨害工农青年的生产情绪，实质上也是过渡时期复杂尖锐的阶级斗争的一种反映云。好一顶沉重的大帽子！
    但嘁嘁喳喳者流，也并没有举出任何实例，证明她们理想的爱人都是资本家，理想的职业都是当老板娘，所指责的也不过是女工们往往爱慕技术员和解放军军官，农村姑娘们往往爱慕工人，诸如此类而已。老实说，我是很怀疑这种情况反映的真实程度的。即如所云，我也看不出这里面有什么不好。倘说，姑娘们不应该自挑爱人，那是于法无据的。倘说，爱慕了工人、技术员、解放军军官，就是资产阶级享乐腐化思想，那是于理不通的。剩下来，只有一个理由，就是说她们爱的并不是人，而是物质享受，不爱的也并不是人，而是工农业生产劳动的艰苦，云云。
    我不想来辩论一些大道理，例如今天我们社会里一切工作都是艰苦而光荣的劳动，在劳动的基础上改进个人物质生活乃是完全合理的要求，把姑娘们的爱情一律理解得那么庸俗，正好暴露出理解者自己的庸俗，等等。我只想为我们的新国家呼吁一下：女人也有权利来挑男人，这是我们的新国家才会有的好现象，应该鼓掌，应该欢呼。就算开初她们挑选的标准还未尽妥善，也不要立刻用大帽子把她们压回去吧！至于某些因为长久找不到爱人而苦恼着的工农青年，他们的苦恼值得同情，他们的生产情绪受到影响也可以理解，但是，其所以尚未找到爱人的原因究竟何在，是不是仅仅因为他们是农民而不是工人，是工人而不是技术员、军官之故呢？这还是大可研究的，特别值得当事者反躬自察的。“她们不爱我，害得我生产搞不好。”这不过是封建的“祸水”论的反一个面，今天大可不必再出自我们口中了吧。
