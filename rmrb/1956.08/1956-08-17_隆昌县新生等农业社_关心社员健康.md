    Longchang County Xin Sheng and Other Agricultural Cooperatives
    Care for Members' Health
    (Our report) In the intense summer farming work, six advanced cooperatives, including Xin Sheng and Hongqi in Loufeng Township, Longchang County, Sichuan Province, have adopted various methods to prevent heatstroke among members, such as working more in the early morning and late afternoon, resting more at noon, not holding meetings in the evening, and purchasing heatstroke prevention medicines.

    Recently, each cooperative has adjusted its working hours, generally going to work early in the morning and finishing late in the afternoon, resting during the hottest part of the day (around 1 to 5 pm), and not holding meetings in the evening.

    Cooperative cadres also frequently visit members' homes to help solve their difficulties. When Li Wancheng, a member of the Hongxing Cooperative, injured his leg, the cooperative director Dai Xincheng visited him, and the cooperative also lent him money for medical treatment. When members of the Longsheng Cooperative lacked pocket money, the cooperative promptly distributed a portion of cash in advance to solve the members' living difficulties. This has further boosted the production enthusiasm of the members. (Liu Keqiang)

    隆昌县新生等农业社
    关心社员健康
    本报讯　在炎夏的紧张农活中，四川隆昌县楼峰乡新生、红旗等六个高级社采取早晚多干活，中午多休息，晚上不开会和购买防暑药品等各种办法防止社员中暑。
    最近各社都调整了出工时间，一般是清晨早出工，下午迟收工，大太阳的时候（下午一点到五点左右）休息，晚上也不开会。
    各社干部还经常深入社员家里进行访问，帮助解决社员困难。红星社社员李万成腿上受了伤，社主任戴新成就去慰问，社里还借钱给他医病。隆胜社社员没零钱用，社里便及时预分了一部分现金解决了社员生活困难。这样社员生产情绪更加高涨。　　　（刘克强）
