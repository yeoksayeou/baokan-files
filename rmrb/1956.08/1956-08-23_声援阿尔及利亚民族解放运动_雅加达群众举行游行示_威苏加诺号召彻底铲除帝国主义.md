Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 21st - Approximately 2,500 people in Jakarta, mostly students, held a demonstration on the evening of August 20th to support the Algerian people.

On this day last year, the Algerian people launched a large-scale uprising against the French troops stationed in Algeria. The demonstrators handed their resolution to Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo. The resolution expressed support for the Algerian people's struggle against French colonial rule.

The demonstrators also went to the residence of Mohammed Sidiq Ben Yahia, the Algerian representative in Jakarta, and presented him with an Algerian flag to express solidarity with the Algerian people.

The demonstrators had originally planned to also hand their resolution to the French Ambassador to Indonesia, but the doors of the French Embassy were tightly closed when the procession passed by.

President Sukarno addressed the demonstrators in the square in front of the Independence Palace, calling on the Indonesian people to support the struggle of the Algerian people and other people striving for independence. Sukarno said that imperialism, in whatever form, should be completely eradicated from the face of the earth.

    声援阿尔及利亚民族解放运动
    雅加达群众举行游行示威
    苏加诺号召彻底铲除帝国主义
    新华社雅加达21日电　雅加达大约二千五百人，其中大多数是学生，在八月二十日晚上举行游行示威，声援阿尔及利亚人民。
    在去年的这一天，阿尔及利亚人民对驻在阿尔及利亚的法国军队发动了大规模的起义。示威群众把他们的决议交给沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理。决议表示声援阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民统治的斗争。
    示威者还到阿尔及利亚驻雅加达的代表穆罕默德·西迪克·本·雅哈贾的寓所门前，送给他一面阿尔及利亚国旗，表示同阿尔及利亚人民团结一致。
    示威者本来准备也把他们决议交给法国驻印度尼西亚大使，但是法国大使馆的大门在队伍经过的时候紧紧关上了。
    苏加诺总统在独立宫前的广场上向示威群众讲了话，他号召印度尼西亚人民支持阿尔及利亚人民和其他争取独立的人民的斗争。苏加诺说，不管什么样形式的帝国主义，都应该从地面彻底铲除。
