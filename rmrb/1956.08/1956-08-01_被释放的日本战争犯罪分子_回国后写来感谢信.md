Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 29th. Among the first group of Japanese war criminals who were exempted from prosecution and released in late June, seven have sent letters to the Fushun War Criminals Management Center after returning to their hometowns. These letters were recently received.

In their letters, these Japanese expressed their gratitude for the lenient policy of the Chinese people and the care they received in the management center. Tadami Maruya, in a letter sent from Hiroshima Prefecture, said, "I have safely returned to my hometown, and I will never forget the scene of the farewell from everyone at the management center and the help from the Chinese Red Cross." The letter also stated, "What I am considering now is the issue of livelihood, and I must live on no matter what. The valuable life experiences I gained during my years of contact with the Chinese people have given me courage."

Morinosuke Yamanaka, in a letter sent from Saitama Prefecture on July 8th, said, "Before my parents saw me, they imagined me as an exhausted and pale person. My parents thought so, and so did my neighbors. However, when they saw me, the anxiety that had existed for eleven years quickly disappeared. My father said, 'We must thank China.'"

Noriyaki Mimura, in a letter sent from Hiroshima Prefecture, expressed his hatred for the war of aggression. The letter stated, "I was deceived into devoting my youthful enthusiasm to a wrong purpose, and from this bitter experience, I clearly recognized the crime of launching a war of aggression. After returning to my hometown and seeing everything around me, I sincerely hope for a peaceful and happy life."

    被释放的日本战争犯罪分子
    回国后写来感谢信
    新华社抚顺29日电　六月下旬被免予起诉释放回国的第一批日本战争犯罪分子中，有七人在回到故乡后，给抚顺战犯管理所寄来信件。这些信件是最近收到的。
    这些日本人在信中都感谢中国人民的宽大政策和在管理所中受到的关怀。丸谷忠三从广岛县寄来的信中说：“我已经平安无事地回到了故乡，我永远不忘管理所各位送别时的情景和中国红十字会对我们的帮助。”信中又说：“当前我所考虑的是生活问题，不管怎样我要活下去。在几年中我和中国人民接触当中所获得的宝贵的生活体验，给我鼓起了勇气。”
    山中盛之助在七月八日从琦玉县寄出的信中说：“我的父母没看到我之前，曾把我想像是一个疲劳殆尽、脸色苍白的人。父母如此，邻人也如此。可是，当他们看到我时，就很快地消除了十一年来一直存在的不安。我的父亲说：‘必须向中国致谢。’”
    三村法明从广岛县寄来的信中，表示了对侵略战争的憎恨。信中说：“我被骗把青春热情投入错误的目的，从这个苦的体验中，清楚地认识到发动侵略战争的罪恶。我回到故乡看到周围的一切以后，从心里盼望着和平幸福的生活。”
