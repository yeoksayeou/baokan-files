The hydrological technicians, radio operators, and rainfall and meteorological observers distributed across the major and minor rivers of Hebei Province actively conducted flood measurements and transmitted water situation reports during the flood control struggle, playing a significant role in overcoming flood disasters and strengthening flood prevention work.

All personnel at the Huangbizhuang Hydrological Station on the Hutuo River persisted in working day and night during the floods from August 3rd to 5th, and risked their lives to measure the extraordinary flood at the peak. At 5:00 AM on the 3rd, the water in the Grand Canal at the Guantai Hydrological Station rose sharply, seriously threatening the safety of the Grand Canal and the Jinpu Railway. All staff at this station measured the flow rate twenty-nine times and reported the water situation one hundred and forty-four times in three days, effectively cooperating with the flood control work.

Each station demonstrated creativity in capturing flood peaks, overcame various difficulties, obtained hydrological data, and reported it to flood control authorities at all levels in a timely manner. After the floodwaters overflowed the banks of the Fuyang River at the Aizinzhuang Station and flowed into the village, they installed a water gauge on a house to continue water level measurements. The Beihedian Hydrological Station on the Daqing River used elevated buoy piles to measure water levels. When the elevated buoy was washed away, they used the railway bridge to throw buoys to measure the flood velocity. The Xiabao Hydrological Station on the Bai River did not have elevated buoy equipment, so staff risked their lives to swim across the river and throw buoys to measure the flow velocity.

The personnel at the special reporting stations were equally diligent. Radio operators and telegraphers persisted in working day and night, ensuring that "people did not leave the machines and hands did not leave the keys." Various telecommunications bureaus also played an active coordinating role, repairing lines in a timely manner. When the lines at the Dongcichun Station on the Baigou River were washed away, preventing the water situation from being reported, the radio operator swam across the river to send a flood situation telegram, enabling the flood control command to accurately direct flood control work in various regions. The Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters received more than six thousand water situation telegrams from various reporting stations in the seven days from the 2nd to the 8th, with as many as one thousand two hundred and thirty-five received on the 3rd alone. Based on this water situation data, flood control work was able to be carried out in a timely manner.

Now that the flood peaks of the major rivers have receded, the hydrological station personnel in the Tianjin and Cangxian areas are determined to thoroughly carry out measurement and reporting work and ultimately overcome the floods. (Li Canzhang)

    河北省各河水文报汛人员
    在防汛斗争中立下功劳
    本报讯　分布在河北省各大、小河流的水文技术人员、报务人员以及雨量气象观测人员们，在防汛斗争中积极进行洪水测验，传递水情，对战胜洪水灾害加强防汛工作起了很大的作用。
    滹沱河黄壁庄水文站的全体人员在8月3日到5日的洪水期间，昼夜坚持工作，并且冒着生命危险抢测了洪峰到来时的特大洪水。南运河观台水文站3日5时河水猛涨，严重地威胁着南运河和津浦路的安全。这个站的全体工作人员在三天内测流量二十九次，报汛一百四十四次，有力地配合了防汛工作。
    各站在抢测洪峰当中发挥了创造性，克服了各种困难，测到了水情资料，并及时报给了各级防汛机关。滏阳河艾辛庄站在洪水出槽漫滩后，流进了村内，他们就在房上安设了水尺，坚持了水位测验。大清河北河店水文站利用高架浮标桩测水位，高架浮标冲跑了，就利用铁路桥投浮标施测洪水流速。白河下堡水文站没有高架浮标设备，工作人员就冒着生命危险，泅水投浮标测量流速。
    报汛专台的人员同样辛苦。报务员和摇机工人们昼夜坚持工作，作到了“人不离机、手不离键”。各电信局也起到了，主动的配合作用，及时抢修了线路。白沟河东茨村站线路被冲断了，水情报不出去，报务员便泅水过河，拍发汛情电报，使防汛指挥部门准确地指挥了各地的防汛工作。河北省防汛指挥部从2日到8日七天内收到各报汛站水情电报六千多份，仅三日一天就收到一千二百三十五份之多，根据这些水情资料，使防汛工作得以及时进行。
    现在各主要河流洪峰已下泄，天津、沧县两地区的水文站人员决心彻底作好测报工作，最后战胜洪水。　（李灿章）
