Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 7th August: Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike said at a press conference on August 6th that he has requested clarification from the British, French and American governments regarding the scope and objectives of the twenty-four nation conference on the Suez Canal issue.

    He said, I am still awaiting a reply before deciding whether to attend the proposed conference.

    Bandaranaike said: "Egypt has the right to nationalize the canal company, which is hard to dispute. On the other hand, it is also hard to dispute that there is a need to make satisfactory assurances for the international use of this important waterway. It may be possible to reconcile these two needs without insisting that the Suez Canal be under international control. If there is insistence on such international control, it would be difficult to seek any peaceful resolution without resorting to force."

    He pointed out that the convening nations of the twenty-four nation conference seem to have made up their minds to take some course of action to internationalize the canal, which Egypt opposes.

    He said, "Therefore, if the convening nations insist on their point of view, and Egypt insists on its point of view, it seems there is no other way but to provoke war.

    "If this is the case, it is not clear whether our participation in the proposed conference would be useful."

    锡兰总理要求澄清二十四国会议目的
    指出国际控制不能解决问题
    新华社7日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克八月六日在记者招待会上说，他已经要求英法美三国对关于苏彝士运河问题的二十四国会议的范围和目的加以澄清。
    他说，我仍在等待答复，然后再决定是否参加拟议中的这个会议。
    班达拉奈克说：“埃及有权把运河公司收归国有，这是很难置疑的，在另一方面，对国际利用这条重要的通道有必要作出令人满意的保证，这也是很难置疑的。也许有可能在不坚持苏彝士运河要由国际控制的情况下来调和这两种需要。如果坚持要有这样的国际控制的话，那就很难在不诉诸武力的情况下求得任何和平解决。”
    他指出，二十四国会议的召集国家似乎已经打定主意采取某种行动方针使运河国际化，而运河的国际化是埃及所反对的。
    他说，“因此，如果召集国家坚持它们的观点，埃及坚持它的观点，似乎除了挑起战争以外没有别的办法。
    “如果情况真是这样，我们参加拟议中的会议有没有用处，那就不清楚了。”
