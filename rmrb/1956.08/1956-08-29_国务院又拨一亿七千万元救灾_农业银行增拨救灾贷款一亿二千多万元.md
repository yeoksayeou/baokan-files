    Xinhua News Agency, August 28th – The State Council decided on August 25th to allocate another 170 million yuan to relieve people in areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, Shanghai and other provinces and cities that have suffered from typhoon and flood disasters.

    Including the relief funds issued before August, the total amount of relief funds allocated by the state to people in disaster areas this year has reached over 283 million yuan.

    This newly allocated relief fund will be used entirely for food relief, house repairs, and the purchase of winter clothing for people in disaster areas, as well as medical subsidies and for the purpose of restoring production.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 28th – In order to help farmers in disaster areas restore production, develop sideline occupations and solve living difficulties, the Head Office of the Agricultural Bank of China has allocated another 120 million yuan in production disaster relief loans to twelve provinces and cities, including Hebei, Anhui, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Tianjin, in the first and middle ten days of August. It also issued instructions on agricultural loan work in disaster areas, requiring banks in disaster areas to promptly and effectively issue production disaster relief loans.

    The instructions pointed out: Production disaster relief loans should be distributed according to the disaster situation and local conditions under the unified arrangement of the local Party committee, to help farmers solve difficulties in replanting, supplementing planting, changing planting, topdressing, and autumn plowing and sowing, such as the need for seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools; and to actively support local sideline production. In coastal areas, it is necessary to help fishermen who have suffered from typhoon disasters repair boats and mend nets so that they can resume production as soon as possible. Appropriate loan support should also be given to disaster victims for difficulties in food, house repairs, medical care, and livestock feed when state relief and social mutual assistance are still insufficient to solve them.

    The instructions said: In order to take care of disaster victims in severely affected areas with greater difficulties, the loan period should be appropriately extended, and attention should be paid to simplifying procedures, issuing loans in a timely manner, and catching up with production needs in order to give full play to the role of loans.
