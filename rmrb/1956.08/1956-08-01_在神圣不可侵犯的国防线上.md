    The Secret of the Stationery
    One day, a border inspection station was crowded with travelers waiting to be checked. Among the crowd, there was a well-dressed middle-aged man, constantly smoking "Bastille" cigarettes, peering at the inspector's movements through the thick smoke he exhaled. After a while, it was this "traveler's" turn to be checked. The inspector looked at his documents, asked some general questions, and then checked his luggage. Among the "traveler's" clothes, a clean and tidy "stationery" was found. When the inspector swept his sharp gaze over the "traveler," he saw the "traveler" tremble slightly, and beads of sweat rolled down his forehead.
    Two hours later, this "traveler" sat in the office of an officer at the border inspection station. The officer asked, "This stationery of yours is truly extraordinary! Did you bring it back for your own use?" The "traveler" said, "No, these are just a few ordinary sheets of stationery left over from abroad. It would be a pity to throw them away, so I brought them back." The officer smiled, flipped through the stationery in front of him, and then said in a serious tone, "It won't do you any good to play tricks here..." "Comrade, what do you mean? I don't understand." "There are no comrades here for you. Still trying to resist confessing!" With that, the officer applied a chemical agent to the stationery, and immediately the key points of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency's orders for the "traveler" to collect intelligence, as well as liaison codes and ciphers, appeared on the paper. It turned out that he was a disguised special agent. (He Cangyuan)
    Suspicious Footprints
    At dawn, the sea was shrouded in a vast fog, obscuring the distant islands and the surrounding mountains and villages.
    New recruit Li Guozhang patrolled along the sandy beach smoothed by the waves. This was his seventh time performing duty alone. He observed the movements along the coast, carefully checking and analyzing any slight tilting of the reeds or any new traces on the beach. When he reached a place with many sea rocks, he suddenly saw a footprint on the sandy beach. He carefully observed its size and shape, and determined that it was the footprint of a man walking from the land towards the sea. He thought, although people come here to pick seaweed, it's rare for someone to come alone. He followed the footprint with his eyes, and in a place with soft soil, he found that the toe of the footprint left a deeper and more obvious mark than the heel. He thought, when a person walks normally, the center of gravity of the whole body is on the heel, and the heel should leave a deeper and more obvious mark than the toe. Why is this footprint exactly the opposite? He took a few steps back and tested that when a person walks backwards, the toes touch the ground first. And it's the same as this suspicious footprint. Therefore, he judged that it was a trick played by bad elements who had landed. Li Guozhang tracked and pursued, and in a place piled with sea rocks, the footprints disappeared completely.
    Just as he was getting anxious, the squad leader arrived. After Li Guozhang reported, the squad leader decided that they would search separately. Before long, they found two leather shoe sole prints in the grass. They continued to search and finally caught a landed special agent under a tree with lush foliage. (Long Xike)
    Who is the Township Head?
    The patrol team was walking on the seawall when a young man came towards them.
    "Liberation Army comrades, where are you going?" the young man greeted them with a smile and a bow. The patrol leader looked at this person, whose face was unfamiliar and whose every move was unpleasant. He asked him, "Which township are you from?"
    "From Nanmu Township," the young man pointed west with his hand, and said skillfully and cordially, "Comrades, you are welcome to come to our township for a ball game when you have time."
    "Ah, Nanmu Township, who is your township head?" After the leader finished speaking, he thought while staring at the young man.
    "Surname Luo!" The young man was forced to speak by the leader's gaze when he really had no other way. As soon as the leader heard this, he understood everything. The township head was clearly surnamed Zhang, so why did he say he was surnamed Luo! He secretly winked, and the two soldiers behind him walked away along the designated route. He turned around, slowed down, and said as he walked, "I want to talk to Old Luo about organizing the army to help with work. Let's go together!"
    The young man saw that something was wrong, but he pretended to be calm and suspicious: "Our township head, was he recently re-elected! I'm afraid he's not surnamed Luo anymore. Really, I've been out at sea fishing for more than half a month, and I'm unfamiliar with the situation at home." He tried hard to get rid of the leader's entanglement, pointing to the hill ahead and saying, "I have something I want to go to the Youth League Secretary first. I've been out for half a month, and I should report my thoughts, or I'll be criticized for not having a sense of organization."
    "Young man, you're mistaken, the Youth League Secretary doesn't live over there, he lives over here. Come on, I'll take you."
    When they arrived at the Youth League Secretary's home, the young man changed his tune, "To be honest! I came from the city and wanted to buy some bamboo in the countryside. My boss runs a bamboo ware shop."
    The Youth League Secretary also heard the flaw and asked him, "The bamboo ware industry in the city has already been merged into cooperatives, why is your boss still arbitrarily asking you to go to the countryside to collect bamboo? Do you have a letter of introduction?" The young man was stunned by this question and couldn't figure it out for a moment, but he refused to admit defeat and still wanted to quibble: "Comrade, I really didn't know that you need a letter of introduction to collect bamboo in the countryside now, then let me go back and get a letter of introduction and come back!"
    The leader then said seriously to him, "Yes, the procedures in the border area are a bit troublesome, but you don't need to go back to write a letter of introduction. I'll call and ask about it for you. After the situation is clarified, I can take you to the agricultural cooperative to trade." Saying this, he poured a cup of tea and put it in front of the young man: "Sorry, please wait a moment."
    The matter was clarified, and this young man was not a local, nor was he a purchasing agent for any store, but a bad guy who had sneaked into the country. (Li Fenglin)
    The Man Caught "Looking for a Cow"
    Soldier Na Huaxian, with small branches stuck all over his body, hid in a bush beside a mountain road, observing the movements on both sides of the boundary river.
    At noon, the subtropical sun blazed like fire on the border. There wasn't even a breath of wind. Na Huaxian was sweating profusely from the heat. He ate a handful of dry food he had brought in the morning and unscrewed the stopper of his military canteen, taking a few gulps of water. Suddenly, he saw a person jump into the boundary river and swim towards this side. He quickly capped the canteen and watched the person's actions intently. Na Huaxian thought, "This guy is crossing the border illegally, he must not be a good person."
    The man crossed the river and sneaked along the mountain road towards the bushes, getting closer and closer. When the man was only three or four steps away from Na Huaxian, Na Huaxian suddenly jumped out of the bushes and shouted, "What are you doing?"
    "Looking for a cow, my cow, this tall, with a white ring around its neck..." the man said as he retreated. Na Huaxian had already seen the signs that he was about to run away. Na Huaxian took a few big steps to intercept his retreat.
    Na Huaxian found a sharp dagger and a map on the man. The guy knew he couldn't hide it anymore and confessed that he was an informant for the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek troops in Burma. (Wei Hua)

    在神圣不可侵犯的国防线上
    信笺的秘密
    一天，某边防检查站等待受检的旅客显得十分拥挤。在候检的人群中，有一个打扮得十分讲究的中年男子，不停地抽着“炮台牌”香烟，借着吐出的浓烟，斜看检查员的举动。不一会，轮到检查这个“旅客”了。检查员看过证件，作了一般的询问，接着检查行李。在这“旅客”的衣物中，发现有一本洁白整齐的“信笺”，当检查员用锐利的眼光扫视这“旅客”时，只见这“旅客”颤动了一下，额上的汗珠随着滚了下来。
    两小时后，这个“旅客”坐在边防检查站一个军官的办公室里。军官问：“你这本信笺，真是不平凡的信笺呵！是你带回自用的吧！”“旅客”说：“哪里，这是在国外用剩的几张普通信笺，丢了可惜，所以才带回来。”军官微笑着，用手翻着面前的信笺簿，接着又用严肃的口气说：“你在这里耍把戏，对你是没有好处的……”“同志，这是什么意思？我不懂。”“这里没有你的同志。现在还想抗拒坦白！”说罢，这个军官用一种药剂往信纸上一抹，信纸上立时显现出美蒋特务机关命令这个“旅客”收集情报的要点以及联络密码、暗号等。原来他是一个乔装旅客的特务。（何苍源）
    可疑的脚印
    黎明，海面上泛起了茫茫的大雾，掩没了远处的岛屿与周围的山峦和村落。
    新战士李国章沿着被浪花冲平的泥沙海滩巡逻。这是他第七次单独执行勤务了。他观察着海沿上的动静，发现芦苇有一点倾斜的地方，或者海滩上有什么新的痕迹就细心地检查和分析。当他走到一个海石林立的地方时，突然看到泥沙的海滩上有一条脚印。他详细地观察了大小和形状，辨别出是一个男人从陆地走向海边的脚印。他想，这里虽然有人来捡海菜，但很少一个人单独来。他眼不离地地随着脚印走去，在一片泥土松软的地方，发现脚印的脚尖比脚后跟留下的痕迹更深、更明显。他想，人在正常走路的时候，全身的重心是放在脚后跟上的，应该是脚后跟比脚尖留下的痕迹更深、更明显。为什么这条脚印却恰恰相反呢？他后退了几步，试验出人退着走时是脚尖先着地。并且和这条可疑的脚印一样。因此他判断是坏分子登陆耍的花招。李国章跟踪追查，在一片海石堆积的地方，脚印完全不见了。
    正在着急时，班长来了。李国章汇报以后，班长决定两人分头搜查。不多时，他们在草丛里发现两个皮鞋底印。他们继续搜索，终于在一棵枝叶茂盛的树下，抓住了一个登陆的特务。　（龙希克）
    乡长是谁？
    巡逻组在海堤上走着，迎面过来一个青年小伙子。
    “解放军同志，上哪里去？”这位小伙子嘻皮笑脸地点头哈腰。巡逻组长一看这个人，面貌很生疏，一切举止都不顺眼，便问他：“你是哪个乡的？”
    “是楠木乡的，”这位小伙子用手向西一指，又熟练又亲切地说，“同志，有空欢迎你们到我们乡来赛球。”
    “啊，楠木乡，你们乡长是谁？”组长说完后，一边思考，一边用眼盯着小伙子。
    “姓罗嘛！”小伙子被组长的视线迫得实在没有办法，才开了腔。组长一听，全明白了，乡长明明姓张，为啥说姓罗哪！他暗中使了一下眼色，后面的两位战士，便按指定线路走开了。他自己转过身来，放慢了脚步，边走边说“我想找老罗谈谈关于组织大军帮工的事，咱们一起走吧！”
    小伙子一看不对头，但却故做镇静和怀疑的样子：“我们的乡长，最近改选了吧！恐怕不是姓罗的了。真是，出海打鱼半个多月，家里的情况都生疏了。”他极力想摆脱组长的纠缠，指着前面的山岗说：“我有事想先到团支书那里去，出门半个月，该汇报思想了，要不又批评我没有组织观念。”
    “小伙子，你记错了吧，团支书不住在那边，是住在这边。来，我领你去。”
    到了团支书家里，这位小伙子变了卦，“老实说吧！我是从城里来的，想到乡下买点竹子，我的老板是做竹器店的。”
    团支部书记也听出破绽来了，便问他“城里竹器业已合营了，为什么你们老板还擅自叫你落乡收购呢？有介绍信吗？”被这一问，小伙子楞住了，一时弄不清头脑，但不肯认输，还想狡辩：“同志，我确实不知道，现在下乡收购竹子都要介绍信，那让我回去开好介绍信再来吧！”
    组长这时认真对他说：“是呀，边防区的手续要麻烦一些，不过不用回去写介绍信了，我替你打电话问一下，情况弄清楚后，就可带你到农业合作社去交易了。”说着，他倒了一杯茶，放到小伙子面前：“对不起，请稍等一会。”
    事情弄清楚了，这位小伙子不是本地人，也不是什么商店的采买员，而是潜入国境的坏蛋。（李逢琳）
    “找牛”落网的人
    战士纳华贤的身上插满了小树枝，隐藏在山路旁边的一丛草里，观察着界河两岸的动静。
    晌午了，亚热带的阳光火一样地射着边境。一点风儿也没有。纳华贤热得直淌汗。他吃了一把早上带来的干粮，又拔开军用水壶的木塞，“咕嘟咕嘟”喝了几口水。突然，他发现一个人跳进界河里朝这边游。他赶紧把水壶盖好，目不转睛地注视着那个人的行动。纳华贤想：“这家伙偷越国境，一定不是好人。”
    那人过了河，便鬼鬼祟祟地顺着山路朝树丛走来，越来越近了。当那人只离纳华贤三四步时，纳华贤忽然从草丛里跳出来，大声问他“干什么的？”
    “找牛，我的牛，这么高，脖子上有一圈白毛……”那人边说边往后退。他准备逃跑的迹象早被纳华贤看出来了。纳华贤几大步绕过去截住了他的退路。
    纳华贤从那人身上搜出一把锋利的匕首，和一张路线图。那家伙知道隐瞒不过了，招认了他是逃缅蒋军的情报员。　（蔚华）（附图片）
