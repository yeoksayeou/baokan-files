    A road is made by walking where there was no road before. A route map is drawn after the road has been walked. A route map is indispensable; with it, one walks faster and better. But is there anyone who can't move an inch without a route map? Is there anyone who mistakes studying the route map for having already walked the road? No.

    Then why are there quite a few people who dare not think without theoretical principles, and even regard reciting theoretical principles as thinking?

    To interfere with life is to be a brave warrior.

    Meddling in "the neighbor's cat giving birth" is just the chatter of old women in the old days.

    Those who admire and encourage personality cults never say, "I am just an individual. Come and worship me!" Instead, they say, "The organization is supreme, and I am the representative of the organization."

    The scary part lies precisely here.

    Independent thinking must be vigorously promoted and is urgently needed precisely because of this.

    Picking up sesame seeds and missing the watermelon is because you mistook the sesame seeds for watermelons.

    Raising every little thing "to the height of principle" will inevitably lower truly important things to the level of non-principle.

    Upon receiving criticism, one must admit all mistakes, not be allowed to defend oneself, let alone offer counter-criticism. When talking about oneself, one is only allowed to talk about shortcomings, not strengths, otherwise one is "arrogant and complacent."

    These practices are only enough to cultivate a habit of saying one thing and meaning another, and only enough to undermine people's legitimate self-esteem and self-confidence.

    Launching movements is great. Many problems that cannot be solved in normal times can be solved thoroughly and collectively during a movement.

    But if it becomes the case that no problem can be solved without launching a movement, and one is at a loss without launching a movement, then that is terrible.

    Everyone has a sense of right and wrong. But not everyone can easily distinguish between things that are similar.

    When it is time to oppose rash advances, everyone is of the same mind and comes to oppose rash advances. But what is a rash advance? Not everyone is entirely clear. Thus, some manifestations of socialist enthusiasm are opposed along with it.

    When it is time to oppose conservatism, for the same reason, some realistic and pragmatic scientific spirit will be opposed along with genuine conservatism, and some blind and rash styles of work will be advocated along with socialist enthusiasm.

    Accurately clarifying the specific content of each concept, especially drawing a clear line between various similarities, is a great task.

    炎风小语

    路是从没有路的地方走出来的。路程图是走出了路之后才画出来的。路程图不可少，有了它，走得更快更好。但有谁离了路程图就寸步难行的么？有谁把熟看路程图就当作是已经走了路的么？没有。
    那么，为什么却有不少人离了理论原则就不敢思想，甚至就把背诵理论原则当作是思想呢？
    干预生活的是勇士。
    管到“邻猫生子”的，只是旧时老太婆们的唠叨而已。
    欣赏和鼓励个人崇拜的人，从来不会说：“我，只是个人。你们来崇拜我！”而是说：“组织是无上的，而我就是组织的代表。”
    可怕之处，正在于此。
    独立思考之所以必需大力提倡，刻不容缓，正由于此。
    拣了芝麻，漏了西瓜，是因为把芝麻当成了西瓜的缘故。
    什么小事都“提到原则性的高度”，必然会把真正的大事降到非原则性的低度。
    一受批评，便需全盘认错，不许辩护，更不许反批评。凡说到自己，只许说缺点，不许说优点，否则便是“骄傲自满”。
    这些做法，只足以养成口是心非的作风而已，只足以斫丧人们正当的自尊心和自信心而已。
    搞运动是伟大的。许多平时无法解决的问题，可以在运动当中集中彻底解决。
    但如果弄成一切问题非待搞运动不能解决，离开搞运动便束手无策，那就可怕了。
    是非之心，人皆有之。疑似之间，却不是人人都容易辨别。
    应该反冒进的时候，人同此心，都来反冒进。但什么是冒进呢？却不是人人都十分明白。于是，把一些社会主义积极性的表现，一块儿反掉了。
    应该反保守的时候，由于同样的原因，又会把一些实事求是的科学精神同真正的保守一块儿反掉，把一些盲目冒进作风同社会主义积极性一块儿提倡起来。
    确切地弄清楚每一个概念的具体内容，特别是在种种疑似之间划清界线，是伟大的工作。
