    Increasing Cultural Contact
    By Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Head of the Pakistani Journalists Delegation to China
    The Pakistani journalists delegation has concluded its trip to China and returned home. The visit of this delegation was originally intended to coincide with Prime Minister Muhammad Ali's visit to China. Unfortunately, due to the Pakistani Prime Minister's poor health, the visit could not be realized. However, this unfortunate development gave the journalists from Pakistan greater freedom of movement and more opportunities to directly observe and study the new China firsthand. This delegation represents almost the entire Pakistani press and is the spokesperson for various opinions. Pakistan's various political thoughts, left, right, and center, have almost all come into contact with the reality of People's China for the first time, with the people and various regions, and the process of revolutionary progress. I am writing this article in a personal capacity, but I think I can say that no one in the group was not moved by the friendship, hospitality, and love of peace of the Chinese people, and no one was not moved by the high-speed, large-scale progress being made under the people's regime. When all of this is reported to the Pakistani people, it will surely increase further understanding and friendly relations between the two peoples. The importance of the relationship established between the journalists of the two countries, and through them, between the peoples of the two countries, cannot be ignored. It is a pity that this could not be done sooner.
    Two things impressed me particularly deeply. The first is: none of us had ever been to China, either before or after liberation, and the image of the new China in the minds of the vast majority of us was so vague, so unrealistic, and in some respects even completely incorrect. This is true not only for those who are deceived by American propaganda and do not understand the socialist revolution, but also for those who admire the new China. The first group lacks knowledge and understanding of the work and achievements of the people's regime, and the second group has limited knowledge of the magnitude of the tasks and the difficulty and complexity of the work. To be able to correctly appreciate the achievements of the new China and thus generate the correct impression, we must understand the dilapidated situation after the exploitation by feudalists and imperialists in the past—years of suffering, dilapidation, ignorance, and poverty, a situation that still exists and awaits elimination. This leads me to the second point—the people of other countries, especially the people of Asian countries, need more knowledge and understanding of the overall situation in the new China, and need more contact. Of course, this statement is not new, nor does it mean that People's China disagrees with or does not strive to increase such contact. Other factors are hindering it. Due to changes in the world situation, especially the first Asian-African Conference in Bandung, some of these factors are outdated, and other factors may be quietly disappearing.
    Therefore, it may still be timely to consider increasing contact between People's China and the people of other Asian countries, and to consider the scope and possibilities of this development. I would just like to put forward the following shallow opinions that I thought of during the trip in the cultural and academic fields. Due to the lack of accurate materials, these opinions cannot but be vague and fragmented; but there may still be points worth further discussion.
    (1) Language and Literature　Needless to say, language, in addition to being the most direct and comprehensive tool for social contact, is also the key to understanding a country's culture through the study of its literature and history. In the past, our education system and content were mainly controlled by the imperialist rulers to meet their own requirements. Therefore, in many Asian universities, language teaching is biased, emphasizing Western languages, and sometimes, for example, in India and Pakistan, even excluding native languages. Studying Asian languages ​​and literature is considered to be of no academic value. With the collapse of Asian colonialism, this situation should be changed at a faster rate than has already been achieved. Of course, Western languages ​​should still be studied, but greater emphasis should be placed on the study of Asian languages ​​to promote exchanges and cultural and political understanding between the peoples of Asian countries. I may be wrong, but my impression after visiting several Chinese universities is that there may still be considerable room for development in this regard. For example, some universities do not have Asian language departments, and other universities (although they have this department) lack several important Asian language courses. Further expanding these departments, inviting teachers from other Asian countries, and sending students majoring in languages ​​to other Asian universities for short-term study also increases opportunities for personal contact. I know that this kind of thing is already being done, but if the governments and university authorities of China and other countries, such as Pakistan, intervene in this matter, there may be further development. At the same time, arrangements for studying Chinese language and literature in other Asian universities can also be discussed. I don't know if there are any manuals or guides on Chinese (especially simplified characters) specifically for students from Asian countries. Such books and periodicals would be helpful to individuals or teaching groups interested in Chinese.
    Following the issue of language teaching is the issue of language translation. It is true that many modern Chinese works have been translated into Western languages. This is very useful. But to make them popular among a wide range of readers in countries like Pakistan, they need to be translated into the language of that country and published locally. This is unlikely for private publishers, who are unwilling to take the risk of losing money. Therefore, it can be considered whether China can translate more important works into several major Asian languages. Cadres engaged in this work can simultaneously translate important works written in other Asian languages ​​into Chinese. I know that the latter part of the work is already being done, but I still think that more attention can be paid to contemporary works from other Asian countries.
    (2) Films　In many Asian countries, such as Pakistan, where there are no theaters, movies are almost the only form of public entertainment, and on the other hand, they have become the only tool for the public to understand things. The production, distribution, and screening of films are in the hands of private merchants, who of course do not focus on culture, but only on commercial interests. The only Chinese films that can be seen in Pakistan are a few documentaries screened by the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan when China holds industrial and handicraft exhibitions in Pakistan. Several thousand people saw them, which aroused great interest. Of course, longer feature films can only be screened in commercial cinemas, but this has not been done so far. In addition to commercial issues, there are also language difficulties. Pakistani filmmakers cannot translate or dub Chinese films into their native languages ​​of Urdu and Bengali, and the audience does not understand other languages. Therefore, if our language can be copied onto the films in China, it would be much easier even from a commercial point of view. Similarly, films imported from our country can also be copied with Chinese. Some of our country's filmmakers are also cinema owners, and if the language difficulties are resolved, they may purchase, sell, or exchange films with China on a reciprocal basis. Our documentary films are operated solely by the government, and exchanges in this area may be conducted on a government-to-government basis.
    (3) Music　We were all surprised that some of China's orchestral and wind instruments are very similar to ours, and the tunes and melodies of the Xinjiang region are also similar to the music of our border regions. Therefore, the exchange of ideas and mutual performances between Chinese and Pakistani artists and musicians will definitely help both sides' musical imagination and creativity. I am sure that if a song and dance troupe from Xinjiang visits Pakistan, it will be very popular. Similarly, some of our country's musical masters may also interest Chinese listeners. Chinese dance composers may find that some of our instruments can be used in their orchestras. The opposite is also true.
    (4) Medicine　In addition to academic science (in which there have already been some connections), Asian countries also have some inherent traditional knowledge, such as medicine. We are very interested to find that today's China attaches great importance to its inherent medical system and is conducting learning and research in this area. In India and Pakistan, there are also inherent medical methods originating from ancient Greece, Arabia, and India. For a long time, due to lack of advocacy and organized research, this method has been submerged. Even so, most of the medical assistance, especially to the poorer people, comes from this area. Several doctors who use inherent medical methods enjoy a high reputation. There are also several colleges that teach this medical method. Although the theoretical basis of this medical method is not completely scientific, it has a wealth of practical knowledge about the properties of locally produced mineral and plant medicines and the treatment methods of purely local diseases. The exchange of this knowledge between Chinese and Pakistani doctors is valuable to both parties.
    In addition to the above, sports and other recreational activities are also obviously mediums for mutual contact.
    My intention in writing these is that although personal and delegation mutual visits are useful, this kind of contact is limited after all, and the effect is temporary, unless this contact is expanded to other areas, such as language, literature, music, sports, etc. Through these many mediums, not only individuals, but even the masses of both sides come into contact with each other. Only after the thoughts and hearts of the broad masses of people come into contact with each other can true friendship, understanding, and mutual respect grow.

### 增进文化方面的接触

    增进文化方面的接触
    巴基斯坦新闻工作者访华代表团团长  费兹·艾哈迈德·费兹
    巴基斯坦新闻工作者代表团已经结束了在中国的旅行回国了。这个代表团的访问本来是打算配合穆罕默德·阿里总理的访问中国的。不幸由于巴基斯坦总理的健康不好，访问未能实现。可是，这样不巧的发展，倒使从巴基斯坦来的新闻工作者有了更大的行动自由和更多的机会，来对新中国作直接的亲身的观察和研究。这个代表团几乎代表了巴基斯坦全体报界，是各种不同的舆论的发言人。巴基斯坦的各种政治思想，左、右和中间的，几乎全都是这样第一次接触到人民中国的实际情况，接触到人民和各个地区以及革命进展的过程。我是用个人身份来写这篇文章的，但是我想我能够说，全团没有一个人是不被中国人民的友情、殷勤招待和热爱和平所感动的，也没有一个不被在人民政权下所进行的高速度、大规模的进展所感动的。当这一切都向巴基斯坦人民报道了，那一定会增加两国人民之间的进一步了解和友好关系。两国新闻工作者之间因此建立起来的关系，以及通过他们建立起来的两国人民之间的关系的重要性，是不容忽视的。可惜，这样的事不能早一点做到。
    有两件事给我印象特别深刻。第一件是：我们都从没有到过中国，无论解放前或解放后，我们极大多数人心目中的新中国景象是多么模糊，多么不现实，在有的方面甚至于完全是不正确的。这种情况，不仅对于受美国宣传，不了解社会主义革命的受骗的人是如此，就是对景慕新中国的人也是如此。第一种人对于人民政权的工作和成就缺乏知识和概念，第二种人对于任务的重大和工作的艰巨复杂也所知有限。要能正确领略新中国的成就，从而产生正确的印象，那我们就要了解到过去封建主义者和帝国主义者剥削后的残破局面——年深月久的痛苦、破烂、愚昧和贫困，这种情况至今还存在着，等待消灭。这使我想到第二件事——别国人民，特别是亚洲各国人民，需要对新中国的全面情况有更多的知识和了解，需要更多的接触。当然，这样的说法并不是新鲜的，更不是指人民中国方面不同意或者不努力于增加这样的接触。有其他的因素在阻梗。由于世界局势的变化，特别由于万隆的第一次亚非会议，其中若干因素是过时了，其它若干因素说不定也在悄悄的消灭过程中。
    因此，为人民中国和其他亚洲各国人民之间增加接触，为这种发展的范围和可能性多加考虑，或者还不失时宜。我只想在文化和学术方面提出以下几点在旅途中想到的粗浅意见。因为缺乏正确的材料，这些意见就不能不是模糊的、片断的；但是其中或者还有值得进一步商讨之处。
    （一）语文和文学　不用说，语文除了是社交接触中最直接最全面的工具外，也是通过对一国的文学和历史的研究，因而了解一国的文化的锁钥。过去，我们的教育制度和内容，主要是被帝国主义统治者为适应他们本身要求所控制的。因此，在许多亚洲的大学里的语文教学存在着偏向，侧重西方语文，有时候，例如在印度和巴基斯坦，甚至排斥本国语言。研究亚洲的语文和文学，竟被认为在学术上是没有价值的。随着亚洲殖民主义的崩溃，这种情况应该以比已经做到的更高的速度来改变。当然，西方语文还是应该研究，但是更应该大大重视亚洲语文的研究，以此来增进亚洲各国人民之间的交往以及文化上和政治上的了解。我或者是搞错了，但是在我参观了几处中国的大学后所得的印象是：说不定在这方面还大有发展的余地。例如有的大学没有亚洲语文系，而在别的大学里（虽然有了这一系）却缺乏若干重要的亚洲语文的课目。进一步扩充这些学系，从其他亚洲国家延请教师，派遣主修语文的学生到其他的亚洲的大学里作短期学习，也就是增加了个人接触的机会。我知道这一类的事情已经在做了，但是如果由中国和其他国家的政府和大学当局，例如和巴基斯坦的，来过问这件事，那么大概还会有进一步的发展。同时，在其他亚洲大学里研究中国语文和文学的安排，也可以讨论。我不知道有没有专为亚洲各国学生使用的关于中文的（尤其是简体字）手册、指南一类的书刊。这样的书刊对那些对中文有兴趣的个人或者教学团体，是会有帮助的。
    紧跟着语文教学的问题，便是语文翻译的问题。不错，许多中国近代的作品已经译成西方文字。这是很有用的。但是要使它们在像巴基斯坦这样的国家里，在广泛的读者中流行，那就需要把它们译成这一国的文字，在当地出版。这对私人出版商来说是不太可能的，他们不愿意承担赔本的危险。因此，可以考虑是否能在中国将比较重要的作品译成几种主要的亚洲文字。担任这方面工作的干部，可以同时把用其它亚洲文字写的重要作品译成中文。我知道这后一部分的工作已经在做了，但是我还是认为，对亚洲其它国家的当代作品仍有可以更加注意的地方。
    （二）影片　在许多亚洲国家里，例如在巴基斯坦，没有剧院，电影差不多是唯一的公众娱乐项目，从另一方面看，也成了唯一的使公众了解事物的工具。影片的摄制、发行和上演是在私商手里，他们当然不从文化上着眼，而是专顾商业利益。在巴基斯坦所能看到的中国电影，只是当中国在巴基斯坦举行工业和手工艺品展览会的时候，中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆工作人员放映的几部纪录片。好几千人看到了，引起了很大的兴趣。当然，较长的故事片只能在商业化的电影院里上演，但是至今没有这样办过。除了商业方面的问题之外，还有语文上的困难。巴基斯坦的制片家无法将中国影片用乌尔都和孟加拉语文的本国语文来翻译或者配音，而观众是不懂其他语文的。因此，如果能在中国就把我国语文复印在影片上，即使是从商业上考虑也好办多了。同样地，从我国进口的影片也可以复印上中国语文。某些我国的制片家也是电影院的所有人，如果语文的困难解决了，他们就可能在相互的基础上，向中国购买、售出或者交换影片。我们的纪录影片是由政府单独经营的，这方面的交换或者可以在政府与政府之间的基础上进行。
    （三）音乐　我们都很惊奇，中国一部分管弦和吹打乐器和我国的很相似，新疆地区的音调和曲子和我国边疆地区的音乐也很相似。因此，中巴的艺术家和音乐家交换意见，互相演出，一定有助于双方音乐方面的想像和创造。我敢肯定，如果有一个新疆的歌舞文工团去访问巴基斯坦，一定会大受欢迎。同样的，某些我国音乐界的名手或者也会使中国听众感到兴趣。中国的舞曲创作者或者会发现，若干我们的乐器可以用在他们的管弦乐队中。相反也如此。
    （四）医药　除了学术科学方面（这方面已经有了若干联系），亚洲国家也还有若干固有的传统知识，例如医药。我们很有兴趣地发现，今天的中国很注重其固有的医药制度，正在进行这方面的学习和研究。在印度和巴基斯坦，也有发源于古代希腊、阿拉伯和印度的固有的医药方法。长时期以来，由于无人提倡，缺乏有组织的研究，这种方法一直被湮没着。即便如此，大部分的医药帮助，尤其是对较贫苦的人民，还是从这方面来的。几位使用固有的医药方法的医生享有盛誉。教授这种医药方法的学院也有若干存在着。虽然这种医药方法的理论基础还不完全科学化，但是它有大量的关于当地出产的矿物和植物药材的性能、以及纯粹是地方性疾病的治疗方法的实际知识。中国和我国的医生交换这种知识，对双方都是有价值的。
    除了上面讲到的以外，体育和其他方面的文娱活动也显然是互相接触的媒介。
    我写这些的用意是：个人的和代表团的相互访问虽然是有用的，但是这种接触毕竟是有限的，发生的效果也是一时的，除非这种接触扩展到其他方面，例如语文、文学、音乐、体育等等。通过这许多媒介，那不但是个人，就是连双方的群众也彼此接触到了。只有在广大的人民的思想和心灵彼此接触到了之后，真正的友谊、了解和相互尊重才能增长。
