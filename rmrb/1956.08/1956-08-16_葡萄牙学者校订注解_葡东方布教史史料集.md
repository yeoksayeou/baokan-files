    Portuguese Scholars Edit and Annotate
    Collected Historical Materials on the Portuguese Eastern Missionary History
　　The "Collected Historical Materials on the Portuguese Eastern Missionary History" (historical materials starting from 1499), edited and annotated by Portuguese scholar António da Silva Rego, has been published in Lisbon successively since 1947. By 1953, ten volumes had been published, all of which are about India. Historical materials related to China and Japan will also be sorted and published. These materials can be used as a reference for those who study the history of Sino-Western transportation and the history of Western colonialists' aggression against the East. (Ran)
