Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 25th: Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Kusumowidagdo said on August 24th that we can say the London conference was a failure. If that is the case, then our attitude is: other methods should be adopted, such as holding another international conference, to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue.

Someone asked about the news that Foreign Minister Abdulgani might meet with President Nasser in Cairo on his way back to Jakarta. He said that he had not received any notification to confirm whether this news was true. However, he said that it was understandable that Abdulgani would stop in Cairo to meet with President Nasser to discuss the situation of the London conference. He also said that Indonesia's attitude towards Egypt's request to convene a new conference would likely be raised by Abdulgani in his possible talks with Nasser.

On the same day, Indonesian Information Minister Sudibjo said that since the London conference had reached a deadlock, the Colombo countries should study Egypt's request to hold a second Asian-African conference.

He also said that if the Indonesian delegation acted in accordance with our government's policy, it would never accept Dulles' plan for international control of the Suez Canal.

    印度尼西亚外交部发言人主张
    另开国际会议解决运河问题
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人库苏莫维达在8月24日说，我们可以说伦敦会议是失败的，如果情况是这样的话，那末我们的态度是：应当采取其他办法，譬如说举行另外一次国际会议，来和平地解决苏彝士运河问题。
    有人问到外交部长阿卜杜加尼在回雅加达途中可能在开罗会见纳赛尔总统的消息。他说，他还没有得到任何通知说明这个消息是否属实。但是他说，阿卜杜加尼会在开罗停留以便会见纳赛尔总统讨论伦敦会议的情况，这是可以理解的。他还说，印度尼西亚对于埃及要求召开一次新的会议的态度很可能由阿卜杜加尼在可能同纳赛尔举行的会谈中提出来。
    同一天，印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比说，由于伦敦会议陷入僵局，科伦坡国家应该研究埃及提出的举行第二次亚非会议的要求。
    他还说，印度尼西亚代表团如果按照我国政府的政策行事的话，就决不可能接受杜勒斯关于国际管制苏彝士运河的计划。
