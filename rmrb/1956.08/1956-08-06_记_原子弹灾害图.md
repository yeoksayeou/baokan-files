    Remembering the "Atomic Bomb Disaster Pictures"
    Wang Zhi'er
    On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing more than 200,000 people. The diameter of the explosion's epicenter was eight kilometers, and the ground temperature was 6,000 degrees. The painter Maruki Toshi's house was four kilometers from the edge of the central district. His father, uncles, and others all died, leaving only his mother alive because the collapsed house shielded her. When Maruki and his wife, also a painter, Akamatsu Toshiko, rushed to Hiroshima from Tokyo, they witnessed the horrific aftermath. They resolved to depict it and denounce the atrocities of the imperialists. In the preparatory stage, they painted a total of 500 human figure paintings. By 1956, they had finally completed these ten major works. The first eight depict the suffering and rescue efforts. The last two depict the plight of fishermen from the Yaizu fishing port after the United States tested a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific in 1954, as well as the peace signature campaign launched by the Japanese people.

    The painters said that they were constantly encouraged by the masses during the creative process, receiving helpful suggestions, and making revisions and additions. During an exhibition in Japan, an old woman stroked a baby in one of the paintings. Akamatsu Toshiko wanted to stop her from damaging the painting, but was also deeply moved. Some Japanese viewers even felt that the painters had not fully and truthfully reflected the reality, for example, there were one or two babies in the paintings who seemed to be completely unharmed. The painters said that they couldn't bear to paint it too tragically; they hoped that these children would grow up and fight for peace.

    Their paintings have been exhibited more than 600 times in Japan, with an audience of eight million people. The first three were also exhibited in Europe. In 1952, the painters received the International Peace Gold Medal.

    记“原子弹灾害图”
    王之迩
    1945年8月6日美国在广岛投了原子弹，死亡二十多万人。爆炸中心直径八公里，地面温度六千度。画家丸木位里的家距离中心区边缘四公里。父亲、伯父等都死了，只剩下他的母亲因炸倒的房屋掩蔽了她，没有死。丸木和他妻子、也是画家赤松俊子从东京赶到广岛时，目击了炸后的惨景。他们决心要描绘它，来控诉帝国主义者的暴行。在准备阶段，他们共画了五百幅人体画。到1956年，才最后完成了这十部大作品。前八幅描写受害和救护。后两幅描写1954年美国在太平洋上试验氢弹后烧津渔港渔民受害的情景，以及日本人民开展和平签名运动的情景。
    画家们说，他们在创作过程中不断受到群众的鼓舞，接受有益的建议，进行修改和补充。在日本展览时，一位老大娘抚摸着画上的一个婴儿，赤松俊子一面想去阻止她别弄坏了画，一面也受到了极大的感动。有的日本观众还嫌画家没有充分如实地反映真实，比如画上有一、两个仿佛丝毫也没有受伤的婴儿。画家说，他们不忍心画得太悲惨，他们希望这些孩子长大起来，为和平而战斗。
    他们的画在日本举行了六百多次展览，观众八百万人，前三幅在欧洲也展览过。1952年画家们得了国际和平金质奖章。
