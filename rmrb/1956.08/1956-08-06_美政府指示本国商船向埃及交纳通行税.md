Xinhua News Agency, August 5th, Washington dispatch: The United States Treasury Department issued an order on August 2nd, instructing captains of American merchant ships passing through the Suez Canal to pay tolls to the Egyptian government.

However, the directive stipulates that each captain, while paying the tolls, must also submit a written statement saying that they are paying the tolls under protest, and that they do not waive the right to "recover or take other measures" in the future.

It is said that the State Department insisted on this clause so that if the canal returns to the company's hands, the shipowners can have a basis to demand the return of the tolls already paid to Egypt.

The directive also announced the relaxation of US trade with Egypt. Previously, when the US government froze the assets of the Egyptian government and the Suez Canal Company, it had ordered that American individuals and companies were not allowed to trade with the Egyptian government without permission.

    美政府指示本国商船
    向埃及交纳通行税
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部八月二日颁发命令，指示通过苏彝士运河的美国商船的船长向埃及政府交纳通行税。
    但是这个指令规定各个船长在交纳通行税的同时，要附交一篇书面声明，说他们是在不同意的情况下交纳通行税的，他们不放弃将来可能“收回或采取其他办法”的权利。
    据说国务院坚持这一条款，以便运河一旦回到公司手中的话，船主可以有根据要求取回已经付给埃及的通行税。
    这个指令同时宣布放宽美国同埃及的贸易。在这以前，美国政府在冻结埃及政府和苏彝士运河公司资产的时候，曾经下令不得许可，美国个人和公司不准同埃及政府进行贸易。
