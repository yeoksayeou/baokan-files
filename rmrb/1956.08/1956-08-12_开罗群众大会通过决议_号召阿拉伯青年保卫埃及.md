Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 11th: A mass rally of tens of thousands of people took place in Cairo's Liberation Square on August 10th. Participants included representatives from various Egyptian patriotic organizations, as well as Arab and Greek youth residing in Egypt. Leaders of Arab national movements delivered speeches at the rally. The assembly adopted a resolution calling on Arab youth to mobilize and prepare to defend Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The resolution stated that if imperialists launch an attack, all Arab people will take up arms to defend Egypt.

The rally called for a general strike in all Arab countries on August 15th, ahead of the London conference on the Suez Canal issue. The resolution also condemned "all imperialist attempts to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs and blatantly violate international law, the rights of all peoples, and the United Nations Charter." The resolution warned the colonialist countries that any attempt against Egypt or the Arab world would be met with resolute resistance.

Egyptian President Nasser continues to receive countless letters and telegrams from groups, organizations, and individuals expressing support for the government's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

    据新华社11日讯　开罗消息：八月十日，成千成万的人在开罗解放广场举行集会。参加大会的有埃及各爱国团体代表以及居住在埃及的阿拉伯各国青年和希腊青年。阿拉伯国家的民族运动领袖在会上发表了演说。大会通过决议，号召阿拉伯青年动员起来，准备保卫埃及对苏彝士运河的主权。决议说，如果帝国主义者发动进攻，全体阿拉伯人民将拿起武器来保卫埃及。
    大会号召在关于苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议前夕——八月十五日在各阿拉伯国家举行总罢工。大会还在决议中谴责“干涉埃及内政和公然违反国际法、各国人民权利和联合国宪章的一切帝国主义企图”。决议警告殖民主义国家说，反对埃及或阿拉伯世界的任何企图都将遭到坚决的抵抗。
    埃及总统纳赛尔继续收到无数团体、机关和个人表示支持政府把苏彝士运河收归国有的信件和电报。
