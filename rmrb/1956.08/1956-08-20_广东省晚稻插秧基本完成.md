Guangdong Province has Basically Completed Late Rice Transplanting

(Our Newspaper News) By August 15th, the transplanting work of over 4.1 million mu of late rice fields in Guangdong Province had been basically completed.  The small number of fields affected by drought and unable to be transplanted are being urgently replanted with high-yield crops such as sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes. The planting season is generally about seven days earlier than last year.

Through summarizing the experiences of early rice production and criticizing cadres' blind rashness and timidity regarding technological reforms, the promotion of advanced techniques in late rice production has further developed.  Over 85% of rice fields in the province's counties have adopted close planting with small seedlings. Chao'an County, the nation's first "Thousand-Jin Rice Yield County," has had over sixty agricultural cooperatives revise their overly high targets and rationally formulate land plans, adopting single- or double-seedling close planting based on seedling and fertilizer conditions. Gao'yao and Foshan Special Districts trained a large number of rice transplanters and conducted roving transplanting demonstrations to improve the quality of transplanting.

During summer planting, various localities widely launched campaigns to transplant pest-free seedlings.  The Pearl River Delta, previously most threatened by rice borers, this year adopted methods such as pest control in seedling fields, dipping seedling roots in liquid medicine during transplanting, and inserting smoked bones after transplanting – a "three-barrier" approach – effectively preventing the spread of rice borers.  According to statistics, twenty-one counties and six hundred and thirty-two townships throughout the province have been able to achieve pest-free seedling transplantation.

Currently, various localities have fully transitioned to field management. The broad masses of farmers are conducting field inspections to replant seedlings, carry out mid-season tilling, topdressing fertilizer, and diligently irrigate shallowly. Early-transplanted rice seedlings have already turned green.

    广东省晚稻插秧基本完成
    本报讯　到八月十五日，广东省四千一百多万亩晚稻田的插秧工作已经基本完成。其中少数受旱灾影响不能插秧的田，也正在加紧改种高粱、玉米、番薯等高产作物，栽植季节一般比去年提早七天左右。
    各地通过总结早造生产经验、批判了干部对技术改革的盲目冒进和缩手缩脚思想以后，晚造先进技术的推广有了进一步的发展。全省各县已有85％以上的稻田采用小株密植，全国第一个“水稻千斤丰产县”潮安县，有六十多个农业社修订了过高指标，合理制定土地规划，按照秧苗和肥料等条件分别采取单株或双株密植。高要、佛山专区训练了大批的插秧手，实行巡回插秧示范表演，以提高群众的插秧质量。
    在夏种中，各地广泛地开展插无虫秧运动。过去受螟害威胁最大的珠江三角洲，今年采取秧田除虫、移植时用药液蘸秧头、移植后插烟骨等“过三关”的方法，有效地制止了螟虫的蔓延。据统计，全省能够做到插植无虫秧的有二十一个县和六百三十二个乡。
    现在，各地已经全面转入田间管理、广大农民正在进行查田补苗、中耕、追肥和勤灌浅灌等工作，早插的禾苗已经回青。
