Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 31st - According to a TASS report from Budapest: The Hungarian National Assembly session opened in Budapest on July 30th.

    National Assembly Speaker Rónai, in his opening speech, emphasized the increasing contact between parliaments of various countries, especially those of the socialist camp.

    The meeting then listened to and adopted the report on the activities of the Presidium since the last session, presented by Kristóf, Secretary of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic.

    Based on the proposal of the Presidium of the National Assembly, the National Assembly relieved Gerő of his position as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Boldoczki of his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kish of his position as Minister of Chemical and Power Industries, Altomare of his position as Minister of Food Industry, Erdei-Gruz of his position as Minister of Education, and Czottner of his position as Minister of Coal Mining Industry.

    The meeting elected Hidas as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Marosán as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Imre Horváth as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sándor Horváth as Minister of the reorganized Coal Mining and Power Industries, Szabó as Minister of Chemical Industry, Nyers as Minister of Food Industry, and Kónya as Minister of Education.

    Deputies Vigh and Nezvál requested the parliament to relieve them of their duties as members of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic. The parliament agreed to their requests. Gerő and Rónai were elected as members of the Presidium.

    Former Minister of Defense Farkas resigned from his position as a deputy.

    In the afternoon session, the National Assembly listened to the report on the activities of the Hungarian Council of Ministers, presented by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Hegedüs.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 31st - According to a TASS report from Budapest: The Chairman of the Hungarian Council of Ministers, Hegedüs, delivered a summary report on the work of the Hungarian Council of Ministers at the National Assembly session on the afternoon of July 30th.

    Hegedüs first spoke about the significance of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party. He said that the Central Committee's resolution on the directives for the second five-year plan pointed out the direction for the government to develop the national economy, improve the material living conditions of the working people, and raise the cultural level of the working people. The Council of Ministers will take practical measures to realize this resolution.

    Hegedüs said that in the period since the last meeting, the Council of Ministers has been concentrating all its efforts on solving economic problems. The socialist industry completed 102.2% of the production plan for the first half of the year. Among them, the coal mining industry produced more than 350,000 tons of coal. Agriculture has taken a major step towards mechanization in this economic year. The number of tractors has increased by 3,500, and agriculture has also received a large number of other agricultural machines. In recent years, the mechanization of sowing work in state farms and agricultural production cooperatives has been basically realized. However, the supply of artificial fertilizers has not been improved temporarily.

    Hegedüs pointed out that due to the increased material interests of farmers, improved agricultural technology, and good weather, a bumper harvest is expected this year, and agriculture has every possibility of over fulfilling the annual task.

    Hegedüs continued that the favorable situation in industry and agriculture has enabled the government to take measures to improve the living standards of residents. In the first half of this year, the total value of goods sold to residents increased by more than 1.5 billion forints (Hungarian currency) compared with the first half of last year, and measures have been taken to improve people's living conditions.

    Hegedüs then talked about culture, education and improving the work of state organs.

    Subsequently, Hegedüs spoke about some issues in the international situation and diplomatic activities. He said that the government of the Hungarian People's Republic strives to promote the easing of international tensions and improve cooperation with countries with different social systems, thereby contributing to the maintenance of peace. In line with the desire to pursue a peaceful policy, the Hungarian government passed a decision last week to further reduce its armed forces by 15,000 people. In this way, next year's defense expenditure will be reduced by 35% compared with 1953.

    Hegedüs continued that the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the international events after the Congress made us more aware that further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp is the most important prerequisite for the healthy development of the international situation and the consolidation of peace.

    Hegedüs emphasized that Hungary has made many efforts to develop relations with Yugoslavia. He continued that great importance has also been attached to the development of Hungary's diplomatic relations with other countries. Since February, Hungary has established diplomatic relations with Burma, Sudan and Greece. Negotiations are also underway with eight countries. All these measures and plans are aimed at realizing the principle of active coexistence among countries.

    Hegedüs concluded by saying that the Party and the government, relying on the unity of the working people and in close alliance with the socialist camp countries, will certainly be able to achieve the major tasks before them, and will make unprecedented efforts to prosper the economy and culture, and to build a socialist Hungary by giving full play to the creativity and initiative of the working people.

    前国防部长法卡斯辞去了议员职务。
    在下午会议上，国民议会听取了部长会议主席赫格居斯作的关于匈牙利部长会议活动的报告。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利部长会议主席赫格居斯七月三十日下午在国民议会会议上作了关于匈牙利部长会议工作的总结报告。
    赫格居斯首先谈到匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会最近一次全体会议的决议的意义。他说，劳动人民党中央关于第二个五年计划指示的决议向政府指出了发展国民经济、改善劳动人民物质生活条件以及提高劳动人民文化水平的方向。部长会议将采取实际措施来实现这个决议。
    赫格居斯说，在上次会议以来的时期内，部长会议是在集中一切力量解决经济问题。社会主义工业完成了上半年生产计划的102.2％。其中煤矿工业多生产了三十五万多吨煤。农业在这一个经济年度中向机械化方面迈进了一大步。拖拉机数目增加了三千五百台，农业还得到了大量其它农业机器。最近几年来，已经基本上实现了国营农场和农业生产合作社播种工作的机械化。但是，人造肥料的供应工作暂时还没有得到改善。
    赫格居斯指出，由于农民物质利益有了增长，农业技术得到改进和气候良好，今年丰收在望，农业有一切可能超额完成年度任务。
    赫格居斯继续说，工业和农业方面的有利状况，使政府有可能采取提高居民生活水平的措施。今年上半年，售给居民的货物总值比去年上半年增加了十五亿福林（匈币名）以上，并且采取措施来改善人民居住条件。
    赫格居斯接着谈到文化、教育和改善国家机关工作等问题。
    随后，赫格居斯谈到了国际局势和外交活动中的一些问题。他说，匈牙利人民共和国政府努力促进缓和国际紧张局势，改善同社会制度不同的国家的合作，从而对维护和平作出贡献。匈牙利政府本着奉行和平政策的愿望，在上一星期通过了再一次裁减武装部队一万五千人的决定。这样，明年的国防费用将比1953年减少35％。
    赫格居斯接着说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议以及代表大会以后的国际事件使我们更加明白，进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结是健康地发展国际局势和巩固和平的最重要的前提。
    赫格居斯着重指出，匈牙利为发展同南斯拉夫的联系作了很多的努力。他接着说，在发展匈牙利同其他一些国家的外交关系方面也给予了极大的重视。从二月份以来，匈牙利就同缅甸、苏丹和希腊各国建立了外交关系。现在还正在同八个国家进行着这样的谈判。这一切措施和计划都是为了实现各国积极共处的原则。
    赫格居斯最后说，党和政府依靠劳动人民的团结一致，在同社会主义阵营国家结成紧密联盟的情况下，一定能够实现摆在它们面前的重大任务，并且将以空前的努力为繁荣经济和文化、为建立社会主义的匈牙利来发挥劳动人民的创造力和主动精神。
