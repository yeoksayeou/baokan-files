    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th - Jilin Province, with its short summers, has successfully trialed castor silkworm rearing this year. The results of castor silkworm rearing at each trial point are very good. The two boxes of castor silkworm seeds trialed by the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Kaitong County can produce 60 jin of cocoons and 7 jin of silk floss, increasing the income of cooperative members by 30 yuan.
    Jilin Province plants approximately 30,000 hectares of castor beans annually, so raising castor silkworms has considerable prospects for development.
