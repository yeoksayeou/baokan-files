    Guests Arriving in Beijing, the Capital

    Who can say for sure how many people from all over the country and foreign friends Beijing welcomes every day? Well then, let us introduce some of the people who came to Beijing on July 31st, an ordinary day in people's lives.

    Good News Brought by the Train

    On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, in the ninth carriage of the direct express train from Wuhan to Beijing, a sixty-five-year-old Mrs. Chen excitedly told a piece of good news to the passengers sitting next to her. Pointing to a young woman beside her, she said with a smile: "This time, I am specially accompanying her to Beijing to marry my third son." As soon as she finished speaking, the eyes of the passengers all turned to the young woman with bangs on her forehead, healthy dark skin, and a shy demeanor. Everyone asked with concern: "Have you known each other for a long time!" This young woman's name is Liu Xianrong. She lowered her head and said somewhat shyly: "It's been more than two years, he is an officer in the People's Liberation Army."

    The train pulled into Liangxiang Station, forty-one kilometers from Beijing. Sitting in the eleventh carriage, a woman named Shi Deying asked her neighbors for the eighth time how much longer it would take to get to Beijing, saying: "I specially bought an express ticket, but I didn't expect it to be so slow." After a while, she took out a letter from her arms and asked the passengers next to her where the "Shilibu Hydraulic Machinery Parts Manufacturing Factory in the Eastern Suburbs District" written on the envelope was located. It turned out that she was going to meet her husband.

    First, Go See Tiananmen Square

    At 10:50 AM, more than forty teachers from Henan Normal College and Henan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Accelerated Junior High School, who were on vacation in Beijing, walked out of the Beijing Railway Station with their simple luggage. Teacher Huang Jinglun said excitedly: "Finally arrived in Beijing!" Professor Wei Mingchu said with a smile to him: "You are an old Beijinger, and you still say that?" Huang Jinglun said: "As far as the capital is concerned, if you leave it for a year and a half, you can no longer be considered an old Beijinger, because it changes too fast!"

    Although the teachers did not sleep all night yesterday, everyone's spirits were very high. Some people suggested going to Tiananmen Square first, and everyone agreed. They had only just walked to the Beijing Post Office on Public Security Street when they all looked up at the Monument to the People's Heroes, each squinting their eyes and reading the inscription on the monument. When they walked near Tiananmen Square, their pace slowed down. Some people were comparing Tiananmen Square with the scenes they saw in movies, some were talking about the situation when the "May 1st" and National Day parades passed by every year, and some were looking for the most beautiful shots to take pictures of.

    In the past week, more than two thousand teachers from all over the country have come to Beijing to visit and enjoy their summer vacation. They come from Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Jilin, Chengde, and other places.

    Guests and Returnees from Afar

    At 4:10 PM, a green express train from Moscow pulled into Beijing Station. Before the train had even stopped, the passengers saw crowds of people waving flowers on the platform to welcome them.

    There were fifty-seven international friends on the train. Some of them were here to help with China's construction, and some were here to visit Beijing. Soviet geological experts Xie Minov, Sokonov, Shangtsair, and Yakusheva, who were invited to China to help plan and develop the Yangtze River water conservancy project, were warmly welcomed by staff from the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Geology as soon as they got off the train. From the platform to the station square, a joyous atmosphere of friendship enveloped the area.

    When the train came to Beijing from Tianjin, Polish glider manufacturing expert Steliga said: "This is my second time in China. The Chinese people's hard work, wisdom, and friendship made me really reluctant to leave when I returned home last year." Then, he said excitedly: "This time, my whole family has moved here." Soviet diesel engine production organization consultant Lev also came to China for the second time. Expert Lev said: "Last time I came by plane, but this time I specially took the train in order to see the scenery of the Chinese land."

    There were also many Chinese students on the train who had completed their studies and were returning home or returning for summer vacation, as well as members of Chinese delegations who had returned from international conferences.

    Wang Juntian, a staff member of the Special Engineering Company of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, studied the specialized business of building steel plant sewers in the Soviet Union. He said that after getting off the train in Beijing, he would soon go to Baotou to participate in the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base.

    A Song-Loving Girl from Jiangnan

    Beiwei Road Hotel has recently become a "music building", with beautiful songs and music from the border areas and inland areas being heard all day long. Zhejiang Province musicians who had just arrived in Beijing today gathered enthusiastically in the fragrant courtyard in the evening to rehearse the programs that will be performed at the First National Music Week.

    A folk song team composed of more than ten rural girls first rehearsed the folk song "Wax Plum Blossoms", which is one of the more than ten folk songs popular in their hometown. Among these singing girls, there is a thirteen-year-old vegetable-selling girl named Ding Youdi, whose musical talent was discovered when people heard her round and crisp singing voice on the street. These girls did not sleep the night before they came to Beijing, and they did not rest well for two nights on the train, but they are still so happy and jumpy today. When the national band practices the national instrumental ensemble, the melodious music is simply intoxicating. Wang Yanlong, a fifty-four-year-old veterinarian from Dongyang County Farm, has been playing the唢呐 (suona horn) for more than forty years. He came to Beijing for the first time to participate in the First National Music Week.

    At night, these musically talented girls and veteran artists, along with their counterparts from Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Yunnan, who had arrived in succession in the past few days, went to enjoy the opera "Liu Hulan" specially performed for them by the Central Experimental Opera House.

    Coming to Learn the Most Advanced Science

    The Soviet Exhibition of Science and Technology for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held at the Soviet Exhibition Hall, today received more than thirty scientists who came to Beijing from other places. They are only a small part of the many guests who come to the capital every day.

    Zuo Liliang, director of the Department of Radiology at the Seventh Hospital in Chongqing, and several companions from Sichuan, brought their notebooks today and recorded in their notebooks the applications and results of radioactive isotopes in treatment and diagnosis at the exhibition. He even sketched some instrument graphics. Zuo Liliang said that their hospital is the only place in the southwestern region that uses radioactive radium to treat diseases; their purpose in coming here to study this time is to further study the application of radioactivity in medicine. This is already the second time he has come to Beijing specifically to study. Xie Zhiguang, a famous Chinese radiology expert and director of the Department of Radiology at South China Medical College, visited the entire exhibition today, and exchanged views with Soviet experts on the relationship between radiology and X-ray when he left. Soviet experts introduced him to the situation in this regard in the Soviet scientific community, and he left the exhibition with satisfaction.

    Red Scarves from the East China Sea

    At night, in the athletes' hostel next to the Beijing Gymnasium, the lights were bright, and the staff were busy receiving the young swimming teams from Shanghai, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places. They led these little guests wearing red scarves, batch by batch, into the comfortable bedrooms that had been prepared in advance.

    The Xiamen City Youth Swimming Team is composed of nineteen children aged thirteen to sixteen. They took trains and ships, spending a full eight and a half days, and came to the motherland's capital for the first time. Their excited mood made them forget all fatigue. Late at night, they were still talking to each other about the vast and beautiful land of the motherland they saw along the way and the moving scenery of Beijing at night.

    These children, who grew up on the coast, have been swimming and learning various swimming techniques with adults on the coast since they were young. At the Youth Swimming Games held in Xiamen City this summer, each of them was an excellent player in various competitions. The thirteen-year-old team member Fu Cuirong and her four sisters all love swimming. Her sister, Fu Cuimei, once set a national record for the women's 100-meter backstroke, and she herself was the first place winner in the women's 50-meter backstroke competition at the Xiamen City Youth Swimming Games.

    These young swimming experts will participate in the National Youth Swimming Games in fifteen cities on August 5th. The instructors of each team have formulated training plans and are prepared to use these few short days to conduct the final training before the competition in the swimming pool.

    Arranging Life in Advance for the People

    In the spacious and comfortable Xiyuan Grand Hotel and Far East Hotel, a batch of new guests arrived today. When they reported in speaking dialects from various places, people knew that these guests were state-owned commercial workers from all over the country, coming to participate in various national professional conferences held in Beijing in early August.

    No one would have thought that right in the midst of this hot summer, hundreds of representatives from textile companies and cultural goods companies, braving the hot weather, came to Beijing from Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, the Northeast, and the coastal areas to arrange the winter woolen supply and the spring cultural goods supply plan for next year for the vast number of consumers.

    Among these people, there are many border representatives who have come to Beijing for the first time. They forgot their long-distance fatigue and ran out to look at this and that as soon as they settled down in the hotel. Everything in the capital attracted them, making them feel fresh and interesting.

    Every day, thousands of people from various work posts come to Beijing to attend meetings. For the happiness of the people, regardless of the severe cold or sweltering heat, they tirelessly run around the land of the motherland.

    在首都来北京的客人们
    北京，每天要迎接多少祖国各地人民和外国朋友，谁也说不清。那末，就让我们介绍一下在七月三十一日，人们生活中普通的一天，来到北京的一些人吧。
    列车带来的喜讯
    “八一”建军节前夕，从武汉到北京的直达快车的第九节车厢里，一位六十五岁的陈老太太兴奋地告诉邻座旅客一个喜讯。她指着身旁一位年青姑娘，笑哈哈地说：“这次，我是专门陪着她到北京和我的三儿子结婚的。”话刚落音，旅客们的眼光都转移到那位额前留着“刘海”、肤色黝黑健美、讲话腼腆的姑娘身上。大家都关心地问：“你们认识很久了吧！”这个姑娘叫刘娴嬫。她低下了头，有些羞怯地说：“有两年多了，他是人民解放军的军官。”
    列车驶进了距离北京四十一公里的良乡站。坐在第十一节车厢里的妇女石德英，第八次向邻座的旅客打听，到北京还要多少时间，她说：“我特地买了快车票，想不到还是这样慢。”隔了一会儿，她又从怀里掏出一封信，询问邻座的旅客信皮上写的“东郊区十里堡水工机械配件制造厂”在那里。原来，她是去会见丈夫的。
     先去看看天安门
    上午十时五十分，来北京休假的河南师范学院和河南省革命残废军人速成初级中学的四十多个教师拿着简便的行装走出了北京站台。教师黄经纶十分激动地说：“终于到北京了！”教授魏明初笑着对他说：“你是老北京，也还这么说？”黄经纶说：“对首都来说，离开它一年半，就不能再算老北京了，因为它变化太快了！”
    虽然，教师们昨天一夜没有睡觉，但是每个人的精神都十分饱满。有的人提议先去天安门看看，大家都同意了。他们才走到公安街北京邮局门口，就都仰望着人民英雄纪念碑，一个个眯起了眼睛念着碑上的题字。走到天安门附近的时候，他们步伐变慢了，有些人在比较着天安门和电影上看到的镜头，有的在谈论每年“五一”、国庆节游行队伍通过时的情况，有的在寻找最美的镜头准备照像。
    最近一周来，从各地来北京参观游览欢渡暑假的教师已经有二千多人。他们来自青海、内蒙古、河北、河南、广西、吉林、承德等各个地方。
    万里来客和归人
    下午四时十分，由莫斯科开来的一列绿色快车驶进了北京车站。列车还没有停稳，旅客们就看见月台上欢迎的人群挥舞着鲜花。
    列车上有五十七位国际友人。他们有的是来帮助我国建设的，有的是来北京访问的。应邀来我国帮助规划开发长江水利的苏联地质专家谢敏诺夫、索考诺夫、商采尔和雅库舍娃一下车厢，就受到水利部和地质部工作人员的热烈欢迎。从月台到车站广场，笼罩着一片友谊的欢乐气氛。
    列车从天津来北京的时候，波兰滑翔机制造专家斯泰利加说：“这是我第二次来中国。中国人民的勤劳、智慧和友情，在去年回国的时候，使我真舍不得离开。”接着，他兴奋地说：“这次，我们全家都搬来了。”苏联柴油机生产组织顾问列夫也是第二次来我国。列夫专家说：“上次我是坐飞机来的，这次为了能观赏中国大地的风光，特地改乘了火车。”
    列车上还有许多学成归国或回来度暑假的我国留学生，和参加国际会议归来的我国代表团人员。
    鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司特殊工程公司工作人员王俊田，在苏联学习了建设炼钢厂上下水道的专门业务。他说，他在北京下车以后，将很快到包头参加包头钢铁基地的建设。
    爱歌唱的江南姑娘
    北纬路旅馆近几天变成了一座“音乐楼”，整天都传出边疆和内地的优美的歌声和音乐。今天刚赶到北京的浙江省音乐工作者，傍晚就兴致勃勃地齐集在花草芬香的庭院，排练起将在第一届全国音乐周上演出的节目。
    十多个农村姑娘组成的一支民歌队先练唱了民歌“腊梅花开”，这是她们家乡流行的十多个民歌中的一个。这群爱歌唱的姑娘中有个十三岁的卖菜小姑娘丁幼弟，是人们在街头听到她圆润而清脆的歌声才发现她的音乐才能的。这些姑娘们来北京前一夜没有入睡，在火车上两夜又没有很好地休息，但是她们今天依然是那样的欢跳。当民族乐队练习民族器乐合奏的时候，悠扬的音乐简直醉人。东阳县农场一个五十四岁的老兽医王延龙吹奏唢呐已有四十多年，他因为参加第一届全国音乐周，也第一次来到了北京。
    入夜，这些富有音乐才能的姑娘和老艺人们，随同前些日子陆续来的新疆、蒙古和云南等地的同行们一道去欣赏中央实验歌剧院特为他们演出的歌剧“刘胡兰”。
    来学习最先进的科学
    在苏联展览馆举行的苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会，今天接待了三十多个从外地来到北京的科学家。他们只是每天来到首都的众多客人中的一小部分。
    重庆市第七医院放射科主任左立梁，今天和从四川来的几个同伴带着笔记本，把展览会上有关放射性同位素在治疗和诊断中的应用和结果，一一记在笔记本上。他连一些仪器图形也描绘了下来。左立梁说他们医院是西南地区唯一利用放射性镭治疗疾病的地方；他们这次来这里学习就是要进一步研究放射性在医疗上的应用。他已经是第二次来北京专门学习了。我国著名的放射学专家谢志光是华南医学院放射学教研组主任，他今天全部参观了这个展览会，走时还同苏联专家交换了关于放射学和X光学的关系的意见。苏联专家把苏联科学界在这方面的情况介绍给了他，他才满意地离开展览会。
    东海滨来的红领巾
    夜里，在北京体育馆旁边的运动员招待所里，灯火通明，工作人员们忙碌地接待着来自上海、厦门、福州等地的少年游泳运动队，他们一批一批把这些戴着红领巾的小客人引入早已准备好的舒适的卧房。
    厦门市少年游泳运动队是由十九个十三周岁到十六周岁的少年儿童组成的。他们坐火车、乘轮船，整整经过了八天半的时间，第一次来到祖国首都。兴奋的心情使他们忘记了一切疲劳。夜深了，他们仍然你一言我一语地谈论着沿途看到的祖国辽阔美丽的土地和北京夜晚动人的景色。
    这些在海滨长大的孩子，从小就跟着大人在海滨洗澡、学游泳，熟练各种游泳技巧。在今年夏季厦门市举行的少年游泳运动会上，他们个个都是各项比赛的优秀选手。十三岁的小队员傅翠蓉姊妹四人都爱好游泳。她的姐姐傅翠美曾经创造过女子一百公尺仰泳全国纪录，她自己也是厦门市少年游泳运动会上女子五十公尺仰泳比赛第一名。
    这些少年游泳能手在八月五日就要参加全国十五个城市少年游泳运动会了。各个队的指导员都制定好了训练计划，准备利用这短短的几天，在游泳馆里进行比赛前最后的练习。
    为人们预先安排生活
    在宽敞和设备舒适的西苑大旅社和远东饭店里，今天来了一批新客人。当他们说着各地的语音报到的时候，人们知道这些客人是来自祖国各地的国营商业工作者，来参加八月初在北京举行的各种全国性的专业会议。
    谁也想不到正当这个酷热的盛暑，几百个纺织品公司、文化用品公司的代表，就冒着炎热天气，从新疆、青海、内蒙古、东北和沿海一带来到北京，为广大消费者安排冬季的呢绒供应和明年春季的文化用品供应计划了。
    在这些人们当中，有许多第一次来北京的边疆代表。他们忘记了长途疲困，刚刚在旅店里安顿下来，就跑出来看这看那。首都的一切都吸引着他们，使他们感到新鲜、有趣。
    每天都有几千个各个工作岗位上的人们，来到北京开会。他们为了人民的幸福，不管严寒伏暑，不息地在祖国的土地上奔波着。
