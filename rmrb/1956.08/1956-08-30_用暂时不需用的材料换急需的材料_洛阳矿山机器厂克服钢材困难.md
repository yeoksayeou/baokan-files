Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant overcame difficulties with steel materials by exchanging temporarily unneeded steel for a large quantity of urgently needed steel materials. This averted the reduction of key construction projects due to insufficient construction materials and ensured the completion of the plant construction task according to the state plan.

    According to the construction projects planned for the second half of this year, the factory lacked more than 400 tons of construction materials, including rebar, I-beams, and threaded steel. The factory had applied for allocation from higher authorities and actively purchased materials on the market, but it still did not obtain the urgently needed steel. Under these circumstances, the factory had once considered postponing the construction of the No. 1 Metalworking Workshop, which was about to begin, until next year. The No. 1 Metalworking Workshop is a key project of the factory, and postponing its construction until next year would delay the entire plant construction progress by six months. This approach would inevitably prevent the huge capital already invested in the factory by the state from achieving its intended effect on schedule.

    In order to ensure the completion of the plant construction task according to plan, the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarded solving the steel shortage as the top priority. They assisted the administrative department in first clearing up their own steel inventory, listing the temporarily unneeded steel, and actively going to various places to exchange it. From the beginning of August, the factory dispatched seventeen cadres to Shanghai, Beijing, Taiyuan, the Northeast, and other places to carry out steel exchange work with many factories and mining units. No one returned empty-handed, and they all exchanged for urgently needed steel. Currently, more than sixty tons of steel that have been exchanged in various places are being shipped, and there are still multiple agreements being negotiated. According to the reports of the dispatched personnel, the steel that the factory lacks can be completely resolved. Their approach not only solved the urgent need for steel in their own unit but was also welcomed by many factories and mining units. For example, when they went to the Huai River Management Committee to exchange steel, they solved the Huai River Management Committee's urgent need for steel plates for flood control, and the Huai River Management Committee was also very satisfied to exchange the remaining rebar to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant.

### 用暂时不需用的材料换急需的材料  洛阳矿山机器厂克服钢材困难

    用暂时不需用的材料换急需的材料
    洛阳矿山机器厂克服钢材困难
    据新华社讯　洛阳矿山机器厂用暂时不需用的钢材换回了大批急需的钢材，解除了因建筑材料不足而削减主要工程项目的困难，保证按照国家计划完成建厂任务。
    这个厂根据今年下半年计划施工的工程项目计算，共缺少四百多吨钢筋、工字钢和螺纹钢等建筑材料。这个厂曾经申请上级调拨，并且主动到市场上购买，仍然没有得到急需的钢材。在这种情况下，厂里曾一度想把即将开始施工的一金工车间推迟到明年施工。一金工车间是这个厂的主要工程，如果推迟到明年施工，就会使整个建厂进度拖迟半年。这种做法势必使国家已投入这个厂的巨大资金，不能按期发挥效果。
    为了保证按照计划完成建厂任务，中共洛阳矿山机器厂委员会，把解决钢材不足的问题作为当前的首要任务。他们协助行政方面，首先清查了自己库存的钢材，并将暂时不需用的钢材列出清单，主动到各地去兑换。从8月上旬，厂内派出了十七名干部，分赴上海、北京、太原、东北等地，和许多厂矿单位进行了兑换钢材的工作。所到之处，无一空手，多少都换回了急需的钢材。目前，在各地已经换妥的六十多吨钢材正在起运，还有多处正在协议。根据派出人员的报告，这个厂所缺少的钢材可以完全解决。他们这种做法，不仅解决了本单位急需的钢材，而且受到许多厂矿单位的欢迎。如他们到治淮委员会去兑换钢材的时候，就把治淮委员会目前防汛急需的钢板给解决了，治淮委员会也很满意的把剩余的钢筋换给了洛阳矿山机器厂。
