Title: Tianjin Vehicle Depot Took a Detour in Worker Assessment: Difficult Exam Questions, Hard to Get Promoted, Workers Feel Depressed

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 6th (Xinhua reporter Yin Chongjing): Recently, the Tianjin Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration adopted impractical methods for worker assessment and promotion during the wage reform, causing many experienced but less educated veteran technicians to feel distressed and uneasy.

The vehicle depot's worker assessment is divided into a practical skills section and a theoretical knowledge section. The theoretical knowledge section invariably requires a written test, and those who cannot write must have someone write for them. The test requirements are both complicated and impractical: sixth-grade and above painters must know the ratio of chemical components of various paints; sixth-grade blacksmiths must be able to forge shrimp-shaped elbows, and sixth-grade lathe operators must be able to thread three head screws on a four-point iron pipe. The former question is not only unknown to the workers, but even the technical staff of the entire depot do not fully understand it; the latter two operations are not needed at all in the vehicle depot. As a result of the "assessment," the older and more skilled technicians are less likely to pass. For example, in the East Train Inspection Workshop, 73% of fifth-grade workers failed, and 83% of sixth-grade workers failed. Sun Baofeng, a fifth-grade veteran painter, is one of the most technically skilled in the entire depot, and once proposed rationalization proposals such as adjusting substitutes for thick black paint and saving paint, but only scored forty-odd points this time; Wang Yunfei, a sixth-grade fitter with forty-two years of service, only scored fifteen points. This has made the old technicians feel very depressed, even pessimistic and disappointed. They said, "We are old and useless!" "We know how to do it but can't say it." Many veteran technicians simply do not dare to apply for the exam. Sun Qinghai, a fifth-grade carpenter, told the union wage committee: "I won't take the exam, as long as I can keep my grade and get a little more money to improve my life." Zhao Zhenhua, a sixth-grade carpenter in his fifties, was mobilized to take the exam through old workers' forums and individual talks, but he still didn't take the exam when the time came. He said, "I'll retire in two years, why bother taking the exam?" "I'll do whatever the superiors tell me to do, and guarantee to complete it."

Another result of this complicated worker assessment is that it has created a very tense atmosphere in the depot: the 444 workers who applied for the exam stopped studying culture and were not at ease with production. Many workers are cramming technical grade standards day and night in order to prepare for the exam; during the exam, many workers are trembling and too nervous to answer. When Wang Tianjing, a sixth-grade lathe operator, was doing the practical screw threading test, the job was already done, but he forgot to turn off the switch due to excessive tension and went to drop the tool, resulting in a broken tool and almost causing an accident.

After discovering this situation, the Tianjin Municipal Industrial System Wage Reform Committee suggested that the vehicle depot ask the higher authorities whether this approach was appropriate. The committee believes that after workers study the technical grade standards, conducting an exam can promote workers to learn technology; however, the current widespread use of this method is not in line with the actual situation, especially for many elderly high-level technicians, who have low cultural levels and cannot learn the theory, but these people are precisely the backbone of production, with rich experience and good skills, and the exam cannot explain their actual technical level; if it is done improperly, it will affect their enthusiasm for further improving technology and production.

Now, the Beijing Railway Administration has instructed the Tianjin Vehicle Depot to stop this impractical worker assessment and promotion method.

### 天津车辆段考工工作走了弯路  考题太难，升级不易，工人情绪低落

    天津车辆段考工工作走了弯路
    考题太难，升级不易，工人情绪低落
    新华社天津6日电　新华社记者尹崇敬报道：最近，北京铁路管理局天津车辆段在工资改革当中采取了不切合实际的办法进行考工升级，使许多有经验但是文化水平较低的老技术工人感到苦闷不安。
    车辆段的考工，分为应会技术部分同应知理论部分；应知理论还一律要进行笔试，不会写的人得请人代笔。考试的要求既繁难又不切合实际：要六级以上的油漆工知道各种漆的化学成份的比例；要六级锻工作虾体弯头，六级旋工在四分铁上套三头丝扣。像前一个问题不但工人不知道，连全段的技术人员也不完全了解；后两个操作在车辆段根本不需要。“考”的结果，愈是等级高的老技术工人愈考不上。如东列车检查车间五级工人73％不及格，六级工人83％不及格。五级老油漆工孙宝封是全段技术相当好的，曾经提出调黑厚漆的代用品和节约用油等合理化建议，这次只考了四十多分；有四十二年工龄的六级钳工王云飞只考得十五分。这使得老技工情绪非常低落，甚至悲观失望，他们说，“人老了，不中用了！”“咱们会干不会说”。很多老技术工根本不敢报考。五级木工孙清海对工会工资委员说：“不考，只要能保住等级，长点钱改善生活就行。”五十多岁的六级木工赵振华虽然经过老工人座谈会和个别谈话被动员报考了，但是到考试的时候他还是不考，他说：“凑合两年退休了，还考什么？”“上级叫我做什么，我就做什么，保证完成”。
    这种繁难的考工的另一结果，是在段内引起了非常紧张的空气：四百四十四个报考的工人文化也不学了，生产也不安心了。许多工人为了准备应付考试，加班加点突击背诵技术等级标准；在考试的时候，很多工人浑身发抖，紧张得答不出。六级旋工王天经考实作套扣的时候，活已经做完，由于过分紧张没有关电钮就去落刀，结果把刀奔了，险些出了事故。
    天津市工业系统工资改革委员会发现这一情况以后，就建议车辆段向上级请示这样作法是否妥当。这个委员会认为：在工人学习技术等级标准以后，进行考试。用这种办法可以促进工人学习技术；但是目前普遍使用这种方法不切合实际情况，特别是许多老年高等级的技术工人，他们的文化水平低，理论学不进去，可是这些人恰恰是生产中的骨干，经验丰富，技术又好，考试并不能说明他们的实际技术水平；作得不适当，反而会影响他们进一步提高技术和生产的情绪。
    现在，北京铁路管理局已经指示天津车辆段停止了这种不切实际的考工升级办法。
