Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 14th, saying that the Korean people fully support the recent measures taken by the Egyptian government to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. The Korean people believe that this is a completely legitimate measure for the Egyptian people to exercise their sovereignty.

The statement pointed out that certain Western imperialist countries oppose this just measure of the Egyptian government and have taken a series of military threats, which is not only a blatant interference in Egypt's internal affairs but also an intolerable act that threatens world peace and the security of all nations.

The statement concluded by saying that all the Korean people demand that the imperialists immediately cease their illegal interference and threats against the Egyptian people. At the same time, the Korean people believe that this issue must be resolved peacefully in accordance with the principles of respecting the national rights of the Egyptian people and safeguarding the peace and security of all nations. A meeting like the scheduled London conference cannot legitimately resolve the Suez Canal issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue on the 14th, saying that the Vietnamese people fully support the decision of the government of the Republic of Egypt to nationalize the Suez Canal Company and believe that this issue must be resolved through peaceful consultations based on respect for Egyptian national sovereignty, while ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Suez Canal is on Egyptian territory and was built by the labor of the Egyptian people. Therefore, it is very proper and fully in line with Egyptian sovereignty for Egypt to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. The statement mentioned the Egyptian government's statement on maintaining the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and then pointed out that no country can invoke any reason to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs.

The statement also pointed out that the Egyptian government's actions are fully in line with the principles of respecting national independence and sovereignty and peaceful coexistence of the Bandung Conference, and also in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 15th: The government of the Czechoslovak Republic issued a statement on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company on the 14th, saying that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a completely legitimate action of the sovereign state of Egypt. The situation shows that the Egyptian government has in fact guaranteed the freedom of navigation.

The statement said, "The Czechoslovak government has taken note of the Egyptian government's statement and considers it to be completely satisfactory." The statement pointed out that the actions of the British and French governments violate the recognized principles of international law contained in the United Nations Charter.

The Czechoslovak government believes that the London Conference cannot make any binding decisions, whether from the countries chosen to participate or from the objectives predetermined for the meeting.

The statement supports the Soviet government's proposal that more relevant countries must be invited to participate in the meeting and requests that Czechoslovakia be invited to participate in the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: According to TASS, Sofia, August 14th: The Bulgarian government issued a statement on Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, saying that the Egyptian government's action of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, which operates on Egyptian territory, is in accordance with the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. The nationalization of the canal is a completely legitimate action taken according to Egypt's sovereignty. Some countries are worried that the nationalization of the Suez Canal may hinder navigation, but this is unfounded. The Egyptian government has issued a very clear statement stating that the Egyptian government guarantees the freedom of navigation of the canal.

The statement believes that the fact of nationalization must be taken into account when resolving all issues related to the navigation regime of the Suez Canal. Any attempt to cancel nationalization is tantamount to interfering in Egypt's internal affairs.

The statement expressed support for the Soviet proposal to discuss the issue of freedom of navigation of the canal within the framework of the United Nations. The statement pointed out that if this issue is to be discussed outside the United Nations framework, it can only be done with the participation of all relevant countries. Bulgaria is geographically close to this canal, and the canal plays an important role in Bulgaria's relations with a number of countries, and it has every right to participate in such a meeting.

The statement said that the Bulgarian government expresses its belief that in resolving all issues arising from the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the legitimate interests of the Republic of Egypt and the need to maintain and strengthen universal peace should be taken into account.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 15th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the Albanian government issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue on August 13th, saying that the Albanian government believes that the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is the legitimate and indisputable right of the Republic of Egypt.

The threatening methods and economic and military measures taken by some Western countries against the legitimate decisions of the Egyptian government constitute interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state; at the same time, these actions are contrary to the United Nations Charter and principles and are detrimental to the cause of maintaining world peace.

The Albanian government believes that neither the London Conference nor any other international conference has the right to discuss the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, nor can it pass any decisions that would affect the Egyptian government's sovereignty over the Suez Canal.

The Albanian government expresses its surprise that the initiators of the London Conference did not invite Albania and many other directly related countries to participate in the conference. It believes that only an international conference with representatives from all relevant countries and considering Egypt's legitimate rights and interests can make a positive contribution to the resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

    朝越捷保阿五国政府分别发表声明
    支持埃及收回苏彝士运河公司
    指出只有尊重埃及民族权利才能解决争端
    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人十四日发表声明说，朝鲜人民完全支持埃及政府最近关于苏彝士运河公司国有化的措施，朝鲜人民认为这是埃及人民行使他们的主权的完全合法的措施。
    声明指出，某些西方帝国主义国家反对埃及政府的这个正当措施，采取一系列的军事威胁，这不仅是对埃及内政的粗暴干涉，而且是威胁世界和平和各国人民安全的一种不能容忍的行动。
    声明最后说，全体朝鲜人民要求帝国主义者立即中止对埃及人民的非法干涉和威胁。同时，朝鲜人民认为：这一问题必须按照尊重埃及人民的民族权利和维护各国人民的和平和安全的原则，求得和平解决。像预定召开的伦敦会议那样的会议决不能正当地解决苏彝士运河的问题。
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国政府十四日就苏彝士运河问题发表声明说：越南人民完全支持埃及共和国政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定，并且认为必须在尊重埃及国家主权的基础上，通过和平协商的方式来解决这个问题，同时保证苏彝士运河通航的自由。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，苏彝士运河是在埃及领土上，由埃及人民劳动所建设起来的。因此，埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是很正当的和完全符合埃及主权的事。声明提到埃及政府维护苏彝士运河航行自由的声明，接着指出，任何国家都不能援引任何理由来干涉埃及的内政。
    声明并且指出，埃及政府的行动完全符合万隆会议的尊重民族独立和主权以及和平共处的原则，而且也符合联合国宪章的精神。
    新华社布拉格15日电　捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府十四日就苏彝士运河公司国有化问题发表声明说，苏彝士运河公司国有化是自主的国家埃及的完全合法的行动。情况表明，埃及政府事实上保证了航行的自由。
    声明说，“捷克斯洛伐克政府已经注意到了埃及政府的声明，并且认为它是完全可以令人满意的。”声明指出，英法两国政府的行动违反了联合国宪章中所包含的公认的国际法的原则。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，不论从选择参加的国家或是从会议事先规定的目标来看，伦敦会议都不能作出任何具有约束力的决定。
    声明支持苏联政府所提出的必须邀请更多有关国家参加会议的建议，并且要求邀请捷克斯洛伐克参加会议。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社索非亚十四日讯：保加利亚政府就埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定发表声明说，埃及政府把在埃及领土上经营的苏彝士运河公司收归国有的行动，是符合国际法的原则和联合国宪章的。运河的国有化是根据埃及的主权而采取的完全合法的行动。某些国家担心苏彝士运河的国有化可能妨碍航行，这是没有根据的。埃及政府已经发表了非常明白的声明，说明埃及政府保证运河的自由通航。
    声明认为，在解决有关苏彝士运河航行制度的一切问题时都必须考虑到国有化这个事实。要取消国有化的任何企图都等于干涉埃及的内政。
    声明表示支持苏联提出的主张在联合国的范围内讨论运河的自由通航问题的建议。声明指出，如果要在联合国范围外讨论这个问题，只能够在所有有关国家的参加下才能进行。保加利亚的地理位置靠近这条运河，运河在保加利亚同若干国家的关系上起着重要的作用，它有充分的权利参加这样的会议。
    声明说，保加利亚政府表示相信，在解决由于苏彝士运河公司国有化而引起的一切问题时，应考虑到埃及共和国的合法利益以及保持和加强普遍和平的需要。
    新华社布拉格15日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚政府八月十三日就苏彝士运河问题发表声明说，阿尔巴尼亚政府认为埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是埃及共和国的合法的和不可争辩的权利。
    某些西方国家对埃及政府的合法决定所采取的威胁办法以及经济和军事方面的措施，构成了对一个主权国家的内政的干涉；同时，这些行动是违背联合国宪章和原则，有害于维护世界和平的事业的。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，不论伦敦会议或任何其他国际会议都无权讨论埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的行动，也不能通过任何会影响埃及政府对苏彝士运河的主权的决定。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府对于伦敦会议的发起者没有邀请阿尔巴尼亚和其他许多直接有关的国家参加会议，表示惊异。它相信，只有一切有关国家都有代表参加并且考虑埃及的合法权利和利益的国际会议才能对于苏彝士运河问题的解决作出积极的贡献。
