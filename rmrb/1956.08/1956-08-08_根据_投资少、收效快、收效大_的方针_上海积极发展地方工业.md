    Following the Guideline of "Small Investment, Quick Results, Great Benefits,"
    Shanghai Actively Develops Local Industry
    (Our Shanghai dispatch on the 7th) Shanghai's local industry, in accordance with the central government's guideline of leveraging the potential of coastal industries, is currently undergoing large-scale capital construction. According to statistics from Shanghai's five local industrial bureaus, this year's capital construction investment will increase seven to eightfold compared to last year, with 326 units approved for capital construction. This year marks the year with the largest capital construction investment in Shanghai's local industry since liberation.
    "Small investment, quick results, great benefits" is a characteristic of this year's capital construction investment in Shanghai's local industry. Although the total investment in capital construction has greatly increased this year, the investment allocated to each construction unit is relatively small. There is only one Class B construction unit, with the rest being smaller Class C and Class D construction units. These construction units mainly utilize the existing industrial base for renovation or expansion, thus yielding quick and great results. For example, after the renovation of the Xinye Sulfuric Acid Plant, it will use ore to produce acid instead of sulfuric acid, reducing the cost per ton from the original 315 yuan to 160 yuan, and recovering the entire investment in less than a year. The Taishan Organic Chemical Plant only needs to invest more than 30,000 yuan to modify its existing equipment, and its output will increase by more than half, and the cost will also be greatly reduced.
    This year's capital construction investment in Shanghai's local industry pays special attention to improving product quality, strengthening new product manufacturing, and improving the working environment. Shanghai's local industrial bureaus will establish seventeen laboratories, which will create important conditions for improving the quality of Shanghai's industrial products and increasing new products. Many industrial units with poor working conditions, such as enamel, glass, thermos bottle, and some chemical factories, will focus on improving labor protection facilities. In the investment plan of Shanghai's First Light Industry Bureau this year, investment in improving product quality and trial-producing new products accounts for 44%, and investment in labor protection facilities accounts for 17%. Investment in improving product quality and trial-producing new products in Shanghai's Second Light Industry Bureau accounts for 25%, and investment in labor protection facilities accounts for 36%.
    This year, the proportion of investment in Shanghai's local heavy industry is very large. According to the needs of the country and Shanghai's specific circumstances, Shanghai's local industry will focus on developing the electromechanical industry. This year, twenty-two electromechanical factories will be renovated and expanded, and thirteen of these enterprises will be relocated and rebuilt. These factories will form a new electromechanical industrial zone in Shanghai.
    The rapid increase in capital construction tasks has brought heavy tasks to Shanghai's local industrial departments and construction enterprises. The current situation is: large tasks, insufficient resources, leadership work cannot keep up, lack of building materials and equipment, and insufficient design and construction forces, resulting in very slow progress. By the end of July, the amount of work completed was less than one-third of the annual task. Therefore, to complete this year's capital construction tasks in Shanghai's local industry, Shanghai's capital construction departments still need to make great efforts.

### 根据“投资少、收效快、收效大”的方针  上海积极发展地方工业

    根据“投资少、收效快、收效大”的方针
    上海积极发展地方工业
    本报上海7日电　上海地方工业，根据中央提出的发挥沿海工业潜力的方针，今年正在进行大规模的基本建设。根据上海五个地方工业局的统计，今年基本建设投资将比去年增加七、八倍，被批准进行基本建设的单位有326个。今年是解放后上海地方工业基本建设投资最大的一年。
    “投资少、收效快、收效大”，是今年上海地方工业基本建设投资中的特点。今年基本建设投资的总数虽然有很大增长，但分给每个建设单位的投资却很少，乙类建设单位只有一个，其余全部是规模较小的丙、丁类建设单位。这些建设单位主要是利用原有的工业基础进行改建或扩建，因此收效快而大。如新业制酸厂改建后，将以矿石制酸代替硫酸制酸，每吨成本将从原来的315元降为160元，生产不到一年就可以把全部投资收回。泰山有机化学厂只要投资三万多元，改装一下原有的设备，产量就将提高一半以上，成本也将大为降低。
    今年上海地方工业基本建设投资中，特别注意提高产品质量、加强新产品制造和改善劳动环境等方面。上海各地方工业局将建立十七个试验室，这将为提高上海工业品的质量、增加新的产品创造重要条件。许多劳动条件不好的工业单位，如搪瓷、玻璃、热水瓶及一些化工工厂，将着重改善劳动保护设施。上海第一轻工业局今年的投资计划中，关于提高产品质量和试制新产品的投资占44％，有关劳动保护设施的投资占17％。上海第二轻工业局关于提高产品质量和新产品试制的投资占25％，劳动保护设施的投资占36％。
    今年上海地方重工业的投资比重很大。根据国家的需要和上海的具体情况，上海地方工业将着重发展机电工业，今年有二十二个机电工厂进行改建和扩建，其中有十三个企业并将迁址新建。这些工厂将组成为上海一个新的机电工业区。
    基本建设任务的迅速增加，给上海地方工业部门和建筑企业带来了繁重的任务。目前的情况是：任务大，力量不足，领导工作赶不上，建筑材料和设备缺乏，设计、施工力量也不够，工作进展很慢，到七月底完成的工作量还不到全年任务的三分之一。因此，要完成今年地方工业的基本建设任务，还需要上海基本建设部门作极大的努力。
