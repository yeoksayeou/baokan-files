    新华社11日讯　巴格达消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利和外交部长比塔尔在同伊拉克首相赛义德举行了会谈以后，已经在八月十日晚上离开巴格达去沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得。
    阿萨利和比塔尔是在八月九日到达巴格达的，他们同伊拉克首相讨论了苏彝士运河问题。阿萨利在离开巴格达以前发表谈话说，“我高兴地告诉大家，伊拉克表示在国有化问题上支持埃及。”
    这位叙利亚总理说：“我还满意地发现所有阿拉伯国家的意见在这个问题上都是一致的。”他又说：
  “这一定会有助于下星期日将在开罗召开的阿拉伯联盟政治委员会会议；这个会议是应该得到真正的和令人满意的结果的。所有的阿拉伯国家都已经分别宣布他们准备和埃及合作。”
