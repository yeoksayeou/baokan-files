Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 25th: Farmers in the Songpu District of suburban Harbin, who were affected by the disaster, are actively engaged in production for self-relief, preparing to accumulate capital to rebuild their homes.

More than 130 horse-drawn rubber-wheeled carts from disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives in the district have participated in transportation work in the urban area. More than 900 young and middle-aged people have gone to brick factories, basic construction sites, and the city's food company and sheep farm to work as temporary workers, cooks, and breeders. Agricultural cooperatives such as Jin Xing and Hong Xing have also organized fishing teams, planning to catch 300,000 jin of fish this year. Qian Jin and Hong Xing agricultural cooperatives are also preparing to rush-plant late autumn crops such as autumn spinach and radishes on high ground.

A total of 4,600 hectares of farmland in Songpu District were flooded, and the disaster was relatively serious. However, the disaster-stricken farmers received timely relief and resettlement from the government, so their production mood is stable, and many cooperatives have formulated production self-relief plans. Jin Xing Cooperative plans to earn 270,000 yuan by the end of the year from fishing, transportation, and other sideline production, which is equivalent to the losses suffered in the flood, so that the cooperative's total annual income can still reach the original plan.

In order to better lead the disaster-stricken people to do a good job in production for self-relief, the Harbin Municipal People's Committee held a forum for township and cooperative cadres in Songpu District on August 23 to study and solve some problems in production and disaster relief.

    哈尔滨市郊区灾民
    开展生产自救活动
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　哈尔滨市郊受灾的松浦区农民正积极开展生产救灾活动，准备积资重建家园。
    全区受灾农业社的一百三十多辆马拉胶轮大车，已经参加市区运输工作。九百多个青壮年已到制砖厂、基本建设工地和市食品公司、牧羊场等单位充当临时工、厨师和饲养员。金星、红星等农业社还组织了捕鱼队，计划今年打鱼三十万斤。前进、红星等农业社还准备在高地抢种秋菠菜、水萝卜等晚秋作物。
    松浦区共有四千六百公顷农田被淹，灾情较重，但受灾农民及时得到了政府的救济和安置，因此生产情绪安定，不少社都制定了生产自救计划。金星社计划从捕鱼、运输和其他副业生产中，到年底要收入二十七万元，相当于水灾所受的损失，可使全社全年总收入仍旧达到原订计划。
    哈尔滨市人民委员会为了领导好灾民做好生产自救工作，在8月23日曾召开了松浦区受灾乡、社干部座谈会，研究解决了生产救灾中的一些问题。
