Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 27th: The Fourth World Student Congress opened in Prague on the morning of August 26th. Student representatives from the Soviet Union, China, various People's Democratic countries, the United Kingdom, France, and many other countries attended the congress.

    It is reported that the meeting will focus on discussing the cooperation and unity of international student groups of different tendencies.

    The main agenda of the congress is the first item: the prospects of the world student movement, and the tasks of the International Student Union and student groups in promoting international cooperation to eliminate existing divisions in the student movement and to subordinate this movement to the vital interests of students.

    Other agenda items include: approving new members; revising the constitution; establishing several committees to study issues of common concern to students from various countries, etc.

    At the morning session that day, Mr. Bélicon, Chairman of the International Student Union, explained the written report of the Executive Committee of the International Student Union on the first agenda item. The report emphasized that the Executive Committee firmly believes that unity is in the interests of all students worldwide, and that the unity of students from various countries is conducive to the efforts of all students to solve their own problems.

    The Executive Committee believes that if the International Student Union modifies its constitution and improves its work, it will be better able to serve the interests of students. The International Student Union affirms that it does not want to force the student movement to agree to use it as the sole basis for world student unity. All other student organizations or student groups, especially organizations associated with the Liaison Secretariat of National Unions of Students, can also contribute to world student unity, as long as they express their willingness to consider all proposals for restoring unity and can realistically view the coexistence of two international student groups.

    The report expressed support for the proposal to hold consultations between the International Student Union and the Liaison Secretariat of National Unions of Students.

    At the afternoon session, the representatives began discussions on the report of the Executive Committee.

    争取不同倾向的国际学生团体的合作和团结
    第四次世界学生代表大会在布拉格开幕
    新华社布拉格27日电　第四次世界学生代表大会8月26日上午在布拉格开幕。出席这次大会的有来自苏联、中国、各人民民主国家、英国、法国和其他许多国家的学生代表。
    据悉，会议将集中力量讨论不同倾向的国际学生团体的合作和团结问题。
    大会的主要议程是第一项议程：世界学生运动的前景，国际学生联合会和学生团体在为了消除学生运动的现有分歧和使这一运动服从于学生的切身利益而实行国际合作方面的任务。
    其他议程包括：批准新会员入会；修改会章；成立若干委员会来研究一些同各国学生共同有关的问题等。
    在这天的上午会议上，国际学生联合会主席贝利康就国际学生联合会执行委员会关于第一项议程的书面报告作了说明。这个报告着重说：执行委员会坚决相信团结是符合全世界所有学生的利益的，各国学生的团结有利于所有学生解决自己的问题的努力。
    执行委员会认为，如果国际学联把会章加以修改并且改进自己的工作，它将能够更好地为学生的利益服务。国际学生联合会肯定，它并不想强使学生运动同意以它作为世界学生团结的唯一基础。其他一切学生组织或者学生集团，特别是同各国学生联合会联络秘书处有联系的组织，也可以对世界学生团结作出贡献，只要它们表示愿意考虑关于恢复团结的一切建议，并且能够实事求是地看待两个国际学生集团并存的事实。
    报告表示支持国际学生联合会和各国学生联合会联络秘书处进行协商的建议。
    在下午会议上，代表们就执行委员会的报告展开了讨论。
