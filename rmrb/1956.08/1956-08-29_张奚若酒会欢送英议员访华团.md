Xinhua News Agency, August 28th—Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a reception tonight to bid farewell to the British all-party parliamentary delegation to China.

    At the reception, guests and hosts chatted amicably, and cheerful laughter filled the bright living room. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council asked the guests to toast for the friendship between the Chinese and British people, for the health of the parliamentarians, and for the guests to visit China again.
    The British all-party parliamentary delegation, led today by British Labour Party MP Rankin, proposed on behalf of all members a toast to China, to Chairman Mao Zedong, to Premier Zhou Enlai, and to Zhang Xiruo, President of the Foreign Affairs Institute.
    Schwan, a member of the Free Democratic Party of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, also attended tonight's reception. He spoke with Premier Zhou Enlai about his impressions of China. He believes that China has now made a good start. He said: "After I return, I will report everything I saw in China. I must promote mutual understanding between the People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany, expand economic and cultural exchanges, and eventually establish diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany." Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass to wish Sino-German friendship.
    The reception became more and more enthusiastic. British Labour Party MP Rankin once again expressed his gratitude on behalf of all members for the good hospitality from China. He said: "We will bid farewell to you tomorrow, wishing your people continued prosperity, wishing you all the best, and wishing your road paved with flowers to become a road to peace." Zhang Xiruo, President of the Foreign Affairs Institute, said to the guests: "Your visit has greatly helped to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between China and Britain."
    Among those present at the reception tonight were Li Weihan and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Qian Duansheng, Qiao Guanhua, and Luo Longji, Vice-Presidents of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and people from all walks of life.
