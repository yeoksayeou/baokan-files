    A Group of Professors, Doctors, and Artists Recuperate at Yunnan Workers' Sanatorium

    (Our newspaper Kunming) A group of professors, associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, doctors, artists, and primary and secondary school teachers are currently recuperating and vacationing at the Yunnan Province Workers' Sanatorium. This sanatorium is located in a garden by Kunming Lake, with very beautiful scenery. Coupled with the meticulous care provided by the sanatorium staff, the recuperating members are living very happily. Ma Zhongying, who has worked in primary school education for thirty-two years, said: In the past, the school had no place to live, and no one cared if I had to travel fifty *li* to and from class; now that my hair is gray, I never thought I could live such a life. Deng Xiaoci, the sixty-nine-year-old vice president of Kunming Normal College, excitedly said: This enthusiastic care and attention makes me feel that I have done too little for the people in the past. Zhang Ziqian, an old actor who has performed Dian Opera for sixty-one years, is here today as the master of the country to recuperate, and his excitement is indescribable. At a weekend evening party, he came out more than once to sing flower lanterns and Dian Opera. His happy and excited mood resonated with all the recuperating members.

    一批教授、医生、艺人在云南工人疗养院休养
    本报昆明讯　一批教授、副教授、讲师、助教、医生、艺人、中小学教师，正在云南省工人疗养院里休养度假。这座疗养院在昆明湖边的一个花园里，风景非常优美；加上疗养院人员无微不至的照顾，使休养员们的生活过得非常愉快。做了三十二年小学教育工作的马忠英说：过去学校没地方住，上课来回要跑五十里路也没人管；现在头发花白了的时候，想不到能过上这样的生活。六十九岁的昆明师范学院副院长邓孝慈激动地说：这种热情的关怀和照顾，使我更感到过去为人民做的工作太少了。演过六十一年滇戏的老演员张子谦，今天，他作为国家的主人来到这里休养，真是有说不出的兴奋。在一个周末晚会上，他不止一次的出来演唱花灯和滇戏。他那愉快激动的心情，引起了全体休养员的共鸣。
