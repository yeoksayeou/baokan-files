Joining the Cooperative with Joy, Withdrawing with a Gloomy Face
    Xiao Chaojing

    During the socialist transformation upsurge in January of this year, Chengdu’s handicraftsmen celebrated the collectivization of handicrafts as if it were a festival, with gongs and drums, rejoicing and elation. However, recently, many cooperative members have been withdrawing from the cooperatives with gloomy faces. According to incomplete statistics from the Chengdu Handicraft Industry Bureau, by the end of June, the shoe and hat, bamboo, wood, and palm rattan specialized cooperatives, and the art embroidery production cooperative alone had over 120 members withdrawing.

    Why are they withdrawing from the cooperatives? The main reason is that after joining the cooperatives, the labor income of some members decreased, leading to family financial difficulties. According to a survey of 128 people in the cultural, bamboo and wood, and ironwork industries, the income of 57 people was less than or did not increase compared to before joining the cooperative. Compared to individual handicraftsmen outside the cooperatives, the income of cooperative members appears even lower. The average monthly wage of cooperative members in the city is less than 23 yuan. According to statistics from 176 cooperatives with more than 23,300 people, approximately 48% have a monthly wage income of only 6 or 7 yuan to 25 yuan, while individual handicraftsmen outside the cooperatives have a monthly income of 30 or 40 yuan or more. Therefore, some cooperative members are willing to withdraw and work independently or change professions, and some, although they have not withdrawn, have very negative production attitudes, affecting the poor product quality and poor service attitude.

    There are naturally many reasons for the decline in the labor income of cooperative members; however, one of the main reasons is that the commercial departments have set the cost accounting for handicraft cooperatives too low, and the distribution of industrial and commercial profits is extremely unreasonable. After collectivization, many handicraft products are contracted for sales by the commercial departments, and the commercial departments often set the cost accounting of the cooperatives too low. For example, the actual cost of each foot of velvet in the velvet production cooperative is more than one jiao, but the state-owned company only accounts for it as more than eight fen. Therefore, since January of this year, the cooperative has lost more than 1,270 yuan in expenses alone. In terms of industrial and commercial profit distribution, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed that commercial profits should not exceed industrial profits. However, the relevant departments in Chengdu have not seriously implemented this instruction, and commercial profits are much higher than the profits of handicrafts. The ex-factory cost price of green velvet produced by the No. 3 Velvet Cooperative is 2.2 yuan per foot, with a profit of 4%. However, the wholesale price of green velvet at the Chengdu Wholesale Station of the department store is more than 2.5 yuan per foot, with a profit of 14.46%. The acceptance system for handicraft products is also unreasonably set, and the phenomenon of downgrading and lowering prices is very common. The Chengdu Wholesale Station of the department store has set 36 acceptance standards for the velvet cooperative, but when implementing these standards, there are no scientific instruments, and the acceptance is determined by the inspectors' naked eye observation. In this way, it is difficult for the cooperative's products to meet the company's harsh requirements, and some products that meet the specifications are also rated as substandard. The No. 1 Weaving Cooperative produced 26 mixed yarn cloth, medicinal gauze, and 28 tofu cloth in the second quarter, with a total profit of 2,081 yuan, but the company deducted 2,547 yuan just because the gauze was not "heavy" enough, resulting in a loss of 466 yuan for the cooperative. Some money had to be deducted from the wages of cooperative members.

    There are also many problems in the operation and management of the cooperatives and the arrangement of labor. The excessive public accumulation of some cooperatives is also one of the reasons for the reduced income of cooperative members. In the second quarter, the wage income of members of the No. 5 Daily Metal Production Cooperative accounted for only 65.37% of the total income, and the rest was used as the cooperative's public accumulation. There is also a tendency towards egalitarianism in wage distribution. The Xinghuo Leather Production Cooperative has a total of 18 processes, of which the box-drawing process is more complicated than other processes and has a higher labor intensity, but wages are distributed equally among members of other processes, and some members are unwilling to work in the box-drawing process. In particular, members with good skills but low incomes are even more dissatisfied.

    These problems have not yet been resolved. It is hoped that the handicraft management department will strengthen its leadership over the cooperatives, improve the operation and management of the cooperatives; in particular, it is hoped that the commercial departments will quickly change the phenomena of underestimating the cost accounting of handicraft cooperatives, excessively high commercial profits, and unreasonable product inspection systems. By these methods, the income of cooperative members can be guaranteed, the handicraft production cooperatives can be consolidated and improved, and the handicraft production can be continuously developed.

    欢天喜地入社，愁眉苦脸退社
    萧朝经
    在今年一月份社会主义改造高潮中，成都市的手工业者像过节一样，敲锣打鼓，欢欣鼓舞地庆祝手工业合作化。可是，近来有不少社员又愁眉不展地退出了合作社。据成都市手工业管理局不完全的统计，到六月底止，仅鞋帽、竹木棕藤两个专业社和美术刺绣生产合作社三个单位，就有一百二十多人退了社。
    他们为什么要退社呢？主要是一些社员在入社以后，劳动收入降低，家庭生活困难。据对文化、竹木、铁作三个行业中一百二十八人的调查，有五十七人收入比入社前减少或者没有增加。至于同社外手工业者比起来，社员的收入就显得更低了。全市所有合作社的社员工资，每月平均还不到二十三元。根据一百七十六个社二万三千三百多人的统计，每月工资收入仅六、七元到二十五元的占48％左右，而社外手工业者每月收入却在三、四十元以上。因此，有些社员愿意退社单干或者改业，有些尽管没有退社，但是生产情绪也很消极，影响到产品质量低劣和服务态度不好。
    社员劳动收入降低的原因，自然是多方面的；但是其中主要原因之一，是商业部门对手工业社的成本核定过低，工商利润分配极不合理。合作化以后，很多手工业产品都被商业部门包销，而商业部门在核定合作社的成本时，往往又订得偏低。例如丝绒生产合作社每尺丝绒的实际费用为一角多，但国营公司却只核定为八分多。因此，从今年一月份起，仅费用一项合作社就亏折了一千二百七十多元。在工商利润分配上，中共四川省委指示商业利润不能超过工业利润。但成都市有关部门却没有认真执行这个指示，商业利润大大高于手工业的利润。丝绒第三社生产的青绒，每尺出厂的成本价格为二元二角，利润4％。但百货公司成都批发站每尺青绒的批发价却为二元五角多，利润为14.46％。对手工业产品的验收制度也订得不合理，压级压价的现象十分普遍。百货公司成都批发站给丝绒社规定了三十六条验收标准，而在执行这些标准的时候，又没有科学仪器，凭验收员肉眼观察决定。这样，合作社的产品就很难满足公司的苛刻要求，有些合乎规格的产品也被评为次品。第一织布社第二季度生产的二六混纱布、药纱布和二八豆腐布，共得利润二千零八十一元，但仅因所谓纱布不够“重量”一项就被公司扣除了二千五百四十七元，合作社因此倒亏损四百六十六元。有些钱只得从社员的工资中扣除。
    合作社在经营管理和劳力的安排上，也存在不少问题，有些社的公共积累过多，也是社员收入减少的原因之一。日用金属第五生产合作社，第二季度社员的工资收入仅占总收入的65.37％，其余都作为社的公共积累。工资分配中，还有平均主义的偏向。星火皮件生产合作社共有十八个工序，其中抽箱工序比其他工序复杂，劳动强度较大，但同其他工序的社员平均分配工资，有的社员就不愿到抽箱工序工作。特别是技术好而收入低的社员更是不满。
    这些问题，到目前为止，还没有得到解决。希望手工业管理部门加强对合作社的领导，改善合作社的经营管理；特别希望商业部门要迅速改变对手工业社的成本审核过低，商业利润过高、产品检验制度不合理等现象。通过这些办法来保证社员收入，使手工业生产合作社巩固提高，使手工业生产不断发展。
