Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 24th. Following the bumper harvest of early rice, Sichuan Province is enthusiastically bringing new grain to market. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau, from mid-July to August 15th, the province has already procured over 330 million jin of new grain, more than double the amount procured during the same period last year. The Yibin, Luzhou, and Jiangjin special districts, where the harvest season is earlier, account for over 55% of the total procurement. The Western Sichuan Plain, where the harvest season is usually later, also saw some early rice enter the market in August. Considering the early arrival of the new grain and the simultaneous progress of autumn harvesting and planting in rural areas this year, grain departments in various parts of Sichuan Province have adopted methods such as purchasing in rural areas and storing in batches, while also simplifying the procedures for grain sales and settlements.

    四川新粮上市
    新华社成都24日电　早稻丰收后的四川省，新粮踊跃上市。据四川省粮食厅统计，从7月中旬到8月15日为止，全省已经收购新粮三亿三千多万斤，比去年同期增加二倍以上。收获季节较早的宜宾、泸州、江津三个专区，农民卖出的新粮占全部收购数字的55％以上。一向收获季节较迟的川西平原，8月份也有一部分早稻上市。根据今年新粮上市提早和农村中秋收秋种同时并进的情况，四川省各地粮食部门采取了下乡收购、分期入库的办法，并且简化了售粮结算手续。
