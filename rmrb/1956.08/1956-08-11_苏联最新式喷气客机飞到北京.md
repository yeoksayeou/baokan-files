    Soviet Latest Jet Airliner Flies to Beijing

    (Our report on the 10th) The world-shaking Soviet "Tu-104" new-type jet airliner successfully completed a trial flight between the two capitals of China and the Soviet Union – Moscow and Beijing.

    This afternoon, thousands of people excitedly waited at Beijing Airport for the arrival of the "Tu-104" jet airliner. At 3:48 PM, as people heard a rumbling sound in the sky and looked up to the horizon, a silver-white, streamlined airplane with swept wings flashed across the sky above the airport from the northwest. The plane circled the airport once and then smoothly landed on the runway, at which point the welcoming crowd erupted in thunderous applause.

    This "Tu-104" jet airliner took off from Moscow Airport at 11:30 PM on the 9th (4:30 AM on the 10th, Beijing time), and safely landed at Beijing Airport at 3:50 PM on the 10th. Excluding the approximately three-hour stopovers in Omsk and Irkutsk, the total flight time was just over eight hours, which is more than eleven hours shorter than the flight time of the fastest Il-12 airliner currently flying on this route.

    The captain of the aircraft, Sapergin, told Chinese and foreign reporters that the Moscow to Beijing route is approximately 6,300 kilometers, and the "Tu-104" aircraft maintained a speed of 810 kilometers per hour. There were thunderstorms over Omsk, but the plane flew at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the clouds and felt nothing. He also told reporters that before coming to China, the plane had visited Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Copenhagen, and other places. The Chinese passengers on board the aircraft unanimously praised the new aircraft for being fast, comfortable, and smooth. It was the first time for all of them to ride in this fast, new type of aircraft. Everyone felt as if they were riding in the most comfortable car traveling on a smooth highway. Soviet aviation personnel also guided Chinese aviation personnel to visit the new aircraft.

    According to the person in charge of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the "Tu-104" jet airliner came at the invitation of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, in order to give Chinese aviation industry workers and experts the opportunity to visit the new Soviet aircraft. It will return after a short stay.

    The Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation General Administration of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Beretsky, and the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Soviet "Pravda," and member of the Central Auditing Commission of the CPSU, Zhukov, arrived in Beijing on the plane. They were warmly welcomed by the person in charge of the Civil Aviation Administration of China and Chinese journalists. (Photo attached)

    苏联最新式喷气客机飞到北京
    本报10日讯　震动世界的苏联“TY—104”式新型喷气客机，在中苏两国首都——莫斯科和北京之间试航成功。
    今天下午，成千上万的人们在北京机场上兴奋地等候“TY—104”式喷气客机的到来。三时四十八分，当人们听到空中传来隆隆的响声抬头探望天际的时候，一架银白色的带着箭形翅膀流线型的飞机从西北方向闪电般地掠过机场上空。飞机绕机场飞行一周后，平稳地降落在跑道上，这时欢迎的人群中迸发出雷动般的掌声。
    这架“TY—104”式喷气客机是在九日晚十一时半（北京时间十日晨四时半）从莫斯科机场起飞的，十日下午三时五十分便安全降落在北京机场上，除去中途在鄂木斯克和伊尔库次克停留约三小时外，总共用了八小时多一些的航行时间，比目前在这条航线上飞行的最快的伊尔十二型客机航行时间缩短了十一个多小时。
    这架飞机的机长萨佩尔京对中外记者们说，从莫斯科到北京的航线约六千三百公里，“TY—104”式飞机保持每小时八百一十公里的速度。在鄂木斯克附近上空曾有雷雨，但是飞机在一万公尺的云层上飞行，什么也没感觉到。他还告诉记者们，这架飞机在到中国以前，曾到过华沙、布拉格、布达佩斯、哥本哈根等地。乘坐这架飞机的中国旅客们异口同声地称赞这架新型客机快速、舒适和平稳。他们都是第一次乘坐这种快速的新型客机，大家感觉到如同乘坐行驶在平坦的公路上的最舒适的汽车中一样。苏联航空人员还引导中国航空人员参观了这架新型的客机。
    据中国民用航空局负责人说，“TY—104”式喷气客机是为了使中国航空工业工作人员和专家有机会参观苏联的新式飞机，特应中国民用航空局的邀请前来的，短期逗留后即将返航。
    苏联部长会议民用航空总局副局长别列茨基和苏联“真理报”副总编辑、苏共中央检查委员会委员茹可夫等乘坐这架飞机来北京。他们受到了中国民用航空局的负责人和中国新闻界人士的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
