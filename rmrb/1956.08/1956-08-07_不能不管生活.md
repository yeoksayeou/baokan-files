    Cannot Ignore Life
    To the Editor:
    The employees of the Agricultural Production Team of the Hailun Farm in Heilongjiang Province work particularly long hours, especially in our Agricultural Production Team. We start working at 4:30 AM every day and continue until 9:00 PM when we go to sleep. Besides eating, we have no time for study or rest. We don't even get Sundays off.
    The leading cadres of this farm only care about the employees completing production tasks but don't care about the employees' lives. For example, Ji Guangxin, a worker in the Agricultural Team of the First Station directly under the farm, often travels on business and his salary cannot support his family. Not only did the leadership not help him find a way to solve his difficulties, but they also refused his request to take leave to go home and settle things, forcing him to resolutely demand to leave the farm. Another example is Yu Chuanfu, a cadre from the First Station, who had just recovered from lung disease after more than two years of recuperation and also suffers from severe neurasthenia, making it impossible for him to sustain 16 hours of work per day. He has repeatedly requested the farm's political work section to adjust his work, but more than two months have passed, and the problem has not been resolved.
    The relevant leading departments should correct this situation.

### 不能不管生活

    不能不管生活编辑同志：
    黑龙江省地方国营海伦农场农业生产中队的职工劳动时间特别长，尤其是我们所在的农业生产中队，每天从早晨四点半就开始工作，直到晚上九点睡眠为止，除了吃饭以外，没有丝毫的学习和休息时间。星期日也没有休息。
    这个场子的领导干部只知道要职工完成生产任务，却不关心职工生活。比如农场直属一站农业中队的工人纪光信，由于经常赶车出差，工资不能维持全家生活，领导上不但不帮他设法解决困难，纪光信要求请假回家安置一下，也不允许，逼得他坚决要求离开了场子。又如一站干部于传福，因为患肺病休养了两年多刚好转，而且还有较严重的神经衰弱症，不能支持每天十六小时的工作，曾经数次向场子政工科要求调整工作，但两个多月过去了，问题还没有解决。
    有关领导部门应该纠正这种情况了。　于传福　黄桂林
