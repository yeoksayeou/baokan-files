    The Advancing Japanese Workers' Movement
    Lan Hai
    Since the establishment of the "Japan Productivity Center" in Tokyo in March last year, based on the decisions made at the Shigemitsu-Allison talks, the suffering of Japanese workers has become even more severe. American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, using the slogan "Only by increasing productivity can Japanese industry develop," are carrying out deceptive propaganda among the Japanese people, importing large quantities of American machinery and technology into Japan, and causing Japanese industry to submit to American capital and become a processing factory for the United States.
    Of course, this is inseparable from the US's Far East war policy and the Japanese government's "Economic Six-Year Plan" and "Defense Six-Year Plan," which are adapted to this policy. The aim is to further exploit the Japanese working class, expand Japanese arms production, and dump arms abroad in order to open the way for the revival of Japanese militarism.
    In order to accelerate the implementation of this policy, American capital has strengthened its control over the so-called "lucky industries" - steel, shipbuilding, heavy machinery, chemicals, and other military industries - and increased the production capacity of these industries. For example, the five major companies in the steel industry account for 65% of the country's pig iron production and 50% of the thin steel plate production (compared to only 32% last year).
    Under the pretext of so-called "increased productivity," Japanese industry had accepted 501 cases of so-called "technical assistance" from the United States by the end of 1955. By the time the contracts expire, Japan will have to pay 74.88 billion yen in technical patent fees to the United States. Mitsubishi Electric alone has to pay US-based Westinghouse $1.2 million in technical patent fees every year. Currently, 33.5% of the total capital of the Japanese oil industry and more than 50% of the shares of the aluminum industry have been transferred to foreign capital (mainly American capital). In this way, Japanese workers are under the dual exploitation of American capital and Japanese capital.
    The increased exploitation of the working class has further shrunk the Japanese domestic market. This has further stimulated Japanese monopoly capitalists to militarize industry and rely on foreign markets, and has intensified competition between enterprises. Many small and medium-sized enterprises and the textile industry have been forced to close down. Workers' real wages continue to decline, labor intensity is constantly increasing, and layoffs are becoming more serious. For example, the textile industry is currently canceling some small businesses and laying off 200,000 workers in accordance with the Japanese "Temporary Measures Law for the Fiber Industry Equipment."
    In heavy industry, Nissan Motor Factory employed 7,300 workers in fiscal year 1953 and produced 1,500 vehicles per month, but this year it has reduced its workforce by 1,400 people, while monthly output has increased to 3,800 vehicles. In 1953, Toyota Motor Factory had 46 machines, 46 workers, and 14 inspectors in a workshop in the machine manufacturing factory. Now, it only has 12 workers and 8 inspectors, and plans to reduce the workforce by another 3 people this autumn. The workers working in these workshops have been deprived of even the time to go to the toilet due to the increased labor intensity. Although the workers are all dissatisfied, because the capitalists have adopted the American-style factory management system and deployed secret agents everywhere, workers are immediately threatened with dismissal if they say anything. In fact, workers have no freedom even to breathe.
    In the steel industry, the average monthly output per worker in 1951 was 3.91 tons of steel, but according to statistics from January to March this year, the monthly output per worker has been increased to 6.66 tons. The increase in labor intensity is very rapid. The eight-hour work system has become an empty slogan.
    The increase in labor intensity is accompanied by a constant increase in accidents. In the coal mining industry, there were 24 gas explosion accidents last year alone, with 218 victims, including 103 deaths. In the first half of last year, from January to June, 360 coal miners died in various accidents, and 29,000 were slightly or seriously injured. In the chemical industry, accidents occur almost every day.
    Under such high labor intensity, workers' wages are very meager. Due to rising prices, real wages have been further reduced. The average wage of Japanese workers is less than one-tenth of that of American workers. The real wages of workers at Yawata Iron & Steel Works are only 67% of the pre-war wages. The average wages of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises are even lower, less than 60% of the wages of workers in large enterprises. The wages of Japanese textile workers (mostly female workers) are still 43% lower than those of Indian textile workers today. Driven by life, Japanese workers have to work in factories with extremely high labor intensity and accept unreasonable overtime, so many people suffer from tuberculosis. It is not uncommon for 5% to 10% of workers in a workshop to suffer from tuberculosis.
    At the same time, increased labor intensity has brought more unemployed. Even according to government statistics, the number of fully unemployed has increased from 700,000 last year to 1.06 million in March this year, and the number of semi-unemployed has exceeded 10 million.
    The endless exploitation of American and Japanese capital has aroused strong resistance from the Japanese working class. Although the Japanese government and capitalists have suppressed, divided, and appeased Japanese trade union organizations in an attempt to make the Japanese workers' ranks disorganized and weak, their attempts have been frustrated.
    At its sixth congress in July last year, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided that trade unions should unite according to industrial categories and uniformly carry out the struggle to defend livelihoods centered on raising wages. The development of this struggle is concentratedly reflected in the spring struggle of Japanese workers between February and March this year. 3.5 million civil servants and workers in private enterprises took concerted action in a joint struggle. The power of this unity shook the government and capitalist camp. In the spring struggle, in addition to civil servants, trade unions of 570 private enterprise workers across the country, in accordance with the immediate demands of workers in their respective units, concentrated their efforts to form 200 regional joint struggles. Many workers in small and medium-sized enterprises also participated. In this struggle, 170 new trade unions of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises were created.
    2.3 million civil servants rose up in unison to demand a uniform increase in salaries of 2,000 yen, which was a direct battle against the Japanese government's military budget. The government used various threats and tried to suppress it, but they unswervingly persisted in the struggle and finally forced the government to issue a temporary allowance.
    In the struggle of trade unions in the private enterprise sector, more than 400 trade unions, including the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation, and the National Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation, have all achieved victory.
    The 200,000 workers of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, who waged the most heroic struggle, faced unprecedented enormous pressure from the 14 major coal mining companies all threatening to close down mines, but they persisted in the struggle without giving in. At Mitsui and Miike coal mines, the capitalists installed two-kilometer-long barbed wire fences and mobilized 5,000 armed police, but the 16,000 workers and 20,000 family members of these two coal mines were closely united and successfully carried out a 43-day strike.
    These struggles of Japanese workers to increase wages and improve working conditions are closely linked to their struggle for peace and independence. Because Japanese workers clearly know that their hardship is caused by the US war policy in the Far East and the rearmament policy of the Japanese government that follows the United States. In the struggles of the Japanese people to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, oppose military bases, oppose the revision of the constitution, strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, and support the Okinawan people in opposing the US military's forced expropriation of land, Japanese trade union organizations have always stood at the forefront of the struggle and played a leading role. In the recent House of Councillors election, the Japanese democratic forces made great progress, which was also a victory for the united strength of the Japanese people, headed by the working class.
    On the basis of the growth of struggle strength in the past year, Japanese trade union organizations are uniting and moving forward more widely. Since the end of July this year, many Japanese trade union organizations have successively convened their annual regular congresses to summarize the struggles of the past year and formulate new movement guidelines.
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan with half of Japan's organized workers (more than 3 million members), convened its seventh regular congress in Tokyo for four consecutive days from August 25, and adopted new movement guidelines. The most noteworthy thing is that the congress deleted the "non-participation in joint struggles controlled by the Communist Party" proposed in the draft of this year's movement guidelines. The new movement guidelines also advocate close ties with Chinese trade union organizations and demand that an Asian-African trade union conference be held as soon as possible. At the same time, the congress deleted the section in the draft on strengthening ties with the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions."
    The new movement guidelines of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan strongly advocate defending the workers' right to life. It calls for increased wages, opposes the so-called productivity improvement movement that strengthens capitalists' exploitation, and opposes any attempt by the United States to carry out military rule in the Far East.
    Now there are 14 million workers in Japan, of which about 6 million have joined trade union organizations. These trade union organizations will not only launch joint struggles in the process of striving for the common demands of workers, strengthen trade union organizations, and form a broader front for workers' struggles, but also become the core force of the great unity of the 90 million Japanese people in the struggle of the Japanese people for peace and independence.

    前进中的日本工人运动
    蓝海
    自从去年三月，根据重光、艾利逊会谈的决定在东京设立“日本生产力本部”以来，日本工人们的苦难就更加深重了。美国和日本垄断资本家以“只有提高生产力才是发展日本工业的道路”的口号，在日本人民中大肆进行欺骗宣传，把大量美国机器和技术输入日本，促使日本的工业屈从于美国资本和成为美国的加工工厂。
    当然，这是和美国的远东战争政策以及适应这一政策的日本政府的“经济六年计划”和“防卫六年计划”分不开的，目的是要进一步榨取日本工人阶级，扩大日本的军火生产，向国外倾销军火，以打开复活日本军国主义的道路。
  　为了加紧实施这个政策，美国资本加强了对所谓“走红运的工业”——钢铁、造船、重型机器、化学等军事工业的控制，提高了这些工业的生产能力。如钢铁业的五大公司，就占了全国生铁生产的65％，薄铁板生产的50％（去年仅占32％）。　　在所谓“提高生产力”的借口下，日本工业到1955年底已接受美国的所谓“技术援助”五百零一件。到合同期满的时候，日本将要向美国支付技术专利权费的金额将达七百四十八亿八千万日元。仅仅三菱电机一个公司，每年就要向美国的威斯汀豪斯公司缴纳一百二十万美元的技术专利权费。目前，日本石油工业总资本的33．5％，制铝工业股票的50％以上都已出让给外国资本（主要是美国资本）了。这样，日本工人就处在美国资本和日本资本双重的榨取之下。
    加重对工人阶级的榨取，就使日本国内市场变得更加萎缩了。这又刺激着日本垄断资本家进一步地使工业军事化和依赖国外市场，并加强了企业之间的竞争。许多中小企业和纺织工业等被迫倒闭。工人们的实际工资继续降低，劳动强度不断提高，被解雇的情况也更加严重了。如纺织工业正在根据日本“纤维工业设备临时措施法”取消一些小企业和解雇二十万工人。
    在重工业中，日产汽车工厂1953年度雇用七千三百个工人，月产一千五百辆汽车，可是今年减少了一千四百人，而每月的产量却提高到三千八百辆。丰田汽车工厂1953年在机器制造工场的一个车间，四十六台机器配备了四十六个工人和十四个检查员，现在仅仅配备了十二个工人和八个检查员，而且计划在今年秋天要再减少三人。在这些车间里工作的工人们，由于劳动强度的提高，连去厕所的时间都被剥夺了。工人们虽然全都不满，但是由于资方采用了美国式的工厂管理制度，到处布置了密探，工人们只要说了什么，马上就遭到解雇的威胁。事实上，工人们连呼吸的自由都没有了。
    在钢铁工业方面，1951年工人每月产量平均是3．91吨钢材，据今年1月到3月的统计，工人月产量已经被提高到6．66吨。劳动强度的提高是非常猛烈的。八小时劳动制已经成了一句空话。
    和提高劳动强度同时而来的，是灾害事故的不断增加。在煤矿工业部门，仅瓦斯爆炸事故，去年一年就有二十四起，遭难者达二百一十八人，其中一百零三人死亡。去年1月到6月的半年中，煤矿工人因各种事故死亡者三百六十人，轻重伤者达二万九千人。化学工业部门中，几乎天天发生事故。
    在这样高的劳动强度之下，工人的工资却十分菲薄。由于物价不断上涨，实际工资更加减少了。日本工人的平均工资，抵不到美国工人工资的十分之一。八幡制钢所工人的实际工资，也不过等于战前工资的67％，中小企业工人的平均工资更少，还不到大企业工人工资的60％。日本纺织工人（大都是女工）的工资，到今天还比印度纺织工人低43％。日本工人为生活所迫，不得不在劳动强度极高的工厂中工作，并接受不合理的加班加点，因而很多人患了结核病。一个车间里有5％到10％的工人患结核病的情况，是不稀奇的。
    同时，加强劳动强度带来了更多的失业者。即使根据政府的统计，完全失业者的人数也已从去年的七十万增加为今年3月的一百零六万了，而半失业者更已超过了一千万人。
    美国资本和日本资本的无止境的压榨，激起了日本工人阶级的强烈反抗。日本政府和资本家虽然对日本工会组织进行镇压、分裂和怀柔活动，想使日本工人队伍陷于涣散无力，但他们的这种企图却遭到了失败。
    日本工会总评议会在去年7月的第六次大会中，决定了工会按产业类别联合起来，统一进行以提高工资为中心的保卫生活的斗争方针。这一斗争的发展，集中地表现在今年2月到3月之间日本工人的春季斗争中。三百五十万的官公厅职工和私营企业的工人，采取了步伐一致的联合斗争。这种团结的威力，震撼了政府和资本家阵营。春季斗争中，除了官公厅职工外，全国五百七十个私营企业工人的工会，各自按照本单位工人的切身要求，集中力量组成了二百处的地区联合斗争。中小企业的工人也有很多参加了。在这次斗争中，产生了一百七十个新的中小企业工人的工会。
    二百三十万名官公厅职工，步伐一致地起来要求一律提高薪给二千日元，这是针对日本政府军事预算的直接战斗。政府使用各种威胁手段，试行镇压，可是他们毫不动摇地坚持了斗争，终于迫使政府不得不发了一笔临时津贴。
    在私营企业部门工会的斗争中，合成化学产业工会联合会、日本私营铁道工会总联合会、全国金属矿山工会联合会等四百个以上的工会都得到了胜利。
    最英勇地进行斗争的日本煤矿工会的二十万工人，面临到十四家大煤矿公司一齐以封闭矿井为恫吓的空前未有的巨大压力，但是他们毫不屈服地坚持了斗争。三井、三池煤矿，资方装置了两公里长的铁丝网，动员了五千名武装警察，然而这两个煤矿的一万六千名工人和两万名工人家属，紧密地团结在一起，胜利地进行了持续四十三天的大罢工。
    日本工人的这些争取提高工资和改善劳动条件的斗争，是和他们争取和平和独立的斗争紧密地结合在一起的。因为日本工人们清楚地知道，他们的困苦，是由于美国在远东的战争政策以及追随美国的日本政府的重新武装政策所造成的。在要求禁止原子弹氢弹、反对军事基地、反对修改宪法、争取恢复日苏、日中邦交、支持冲绳人民反对美军强征土地等等日本全国人民的斗争中，日本的工会组织总是站在斗争的前列，起着领导的作用。在不久前的参议院选举中，日本民主力量取得了很大的进展，这也是以工人阶级为首的日本人民团结的力量所获得的胜利。
    在过去一年的斗争力量增长的基础上，日本的工会组织正在更广泛地团结前进。日本的许多工会组织，从今年7月下旬以来陆续地召开本年度的定期大会，总结过去一年的斗争，并制定新的运动方针。
    拥有日本有组织的工人的半数（三百多万会员）的日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会，从8月25日起在东京召开了连续四天的第七次定期大会，通过了新的运动方针。最引人注意的是，大会删除了今年度运动方针草案中提出的“不参加共产党所控制的联合斗争”。新的运动方针还主张密切同中国工会组织的联系，并且要求早日召开亚非工会会议。同时，大会删去了草案中关于加强同“国际自由工会联合会”的联系的一节。
    日本工会总评议会新的运动方针，强烈主张保卫工人的生活权利。它要求增加工资，反对使资本家加强剥削的所谓提高生产力运动，反对美国对远东进行军事统治的任何企图。
    现在日本工人总数为一千四百万人，其中约有六百万人加入了工会组织。这些工会组织，今后不仅在争取工人的共同要求的斗争过程中，展开联合的斗争行动，壮大工会组织，结成更广泛的工人斗争战线，而且在日本人民争取和平和独立的斗争中，也将成为日本九千万人民大团结的核心力量。（附图片）
