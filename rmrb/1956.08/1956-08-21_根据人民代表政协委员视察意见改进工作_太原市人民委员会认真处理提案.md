    The Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee, in the past month, has addressed over a hundred opinions raised by municipal People's Representatives and CPPCC members after inspecting work, promoting various departments to actively improve shortcomings in their work.

    In June, eighty-five People's Representatives and CPPCC members from Taiyuan inspected nine factories, mines, and construction sites, twenty-two agricultural cooperatives, and seven healthcare institutions. Following their inspections, they submitted improvement suggestions to the Municipal People's Committee concerning industrial and mining production, employee welfare, rural work, and industrial and commercial supply and sales. These suggestions have now been conscientiously addressed by relevant departments and factories, mines, and other units. The Zhongyuan Glass Factory originally lacked heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment, leading to frequent cases of employees fainting while operating near high-temperature furnaces. After representatives raised this issue, the Taiyuan Municipal Bureau of Industry invested in installing automatic mixing machines and safety equipment, and installed thirteen water curtains to lower the temperature. Regarding the issues raised by the inspection team concerning the shortage of working capital, limited variety of goods, and short employee rest periods in joint public-private enterprises after the expansion of business, the Taiyuan Municipal Bureau of Commerce not only actively provided loans to joint public-private enterprises to circulate capital, but also improved procedures for sales invoicing and accounting, eliminating overtime. Additionally, over a hundred sales personnel were added to the textile and general merchandise main stores. The representatives and committee members' suggestions on supplying vegetables to urban residents have also been preliminarily improved. The Taiyuan Municipal Bureau of Commerce has increased wholesale markets and established wholesale stations in industrial and mining areas, and has also carried out direct producer-consumer business; adopted multiple supply methods, adjusted vegetable prices, and changed the previous regulation that vegetables were completely controlled by commercial supply and marketing institutions. The Taiyuan Municipal Grain Bureau, based on the inspection opinions, conducted a comprehensive survey of grain-deficient households in rural suburban areas, relaxed the scope and scale of subsidies, and subsidized over 800,000 jin of grain.

    In addition to promptly instructing relevant departments to conscientiously handle the opinions raised by representatives and committee members, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee also sent personnel to supervise and inspect the handling of the situation at any time. According to preliminary review, the vast majority of the more than one hundred opinions handled this time have been handled very well.

    根据人民代表政协委员视察意见改进工作
    太原市人民委员会认真处理提案
    新华社太原20日电　太原市人民委员会在最近一个月内处理了市人民代表和政协委员视察工作后提出的一百多条意见，推动各部门积极改进工作中的缺点。
    太原市八十五个人民代表和政协委员，六月间先后视察了九个厂矿和工地，二十二个农业社和七个医疗保健机构，他们视察后向市人民委员会提出了有关工矿生产、职工福利、农村工作、工商业供销等方面的改进意见。这些意见现在已经由各有关部门和厂矿等单位认真地作了处理。中原玻璃厂原来缺乏防暑降温设备，职工在高温炉旁操作，晕倒现象时有发生，经代表提出意见后，太原市工业局就投资安装自动拌料机和安全设备，并且安装了淋幕水帘十三块，降低了温度。视察组反映的关于公私合营商店营业扩大后发生的资金周转不灵，花样品种不多和职工休息时间少等问题，太原市商业局除了给公私合营商店积极贷款，周转资金外，还改进了销货开票会计等手续制度，消除了加班加点的现象，并且在纺织、百货两个总店增加了一百多个营业人员。代表和委员们提出关于供应城市居民蔬菜的问题也得到了初步改进。太原市商业局除增加批发市场和在工矿区建立批发站外，还开展产销直接见面的业务；采取多种供应办法，调整菜价，并改变了过去蔬菜完全由商业供销机构统一掌握的规定。太原市粮食局根据视察意见，对郊区农村缺粮户进行了全面调查，放宽补助范围和尺度，补助了八十多万斤粮食。
    太原市人民委员会除及时指示各有关部门认真处理代表和委员们提出的意见外，并且派人随时督促和检查处理的情况。据初步审查，这次处理的一百多条意见，绝大多数处理得很好。
