Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 28th: Some responsible persons of the CCP Anhui Lu'an Prefectural Committee have recently gone to the countryside in separate groups to conduct in-depth inspections of the late autumn crop planting situation, and have promptly resolved many important problems in the rush planting.

After suffering from waterlogging and typhoons, the seven counties in Lu'an Prefecture immediately began to rush plant late autumn crops. As of August 23, the entire prefecture had planted more than 2.8 million mu of late autumn crops such as late rice, late corn, mung beans, buckwheat, and potatoes, reaching 87.7% of the planned target. Currently, the farmers in the entire prefecture are in the most intense stage of rush planting late autumn crops. In order to strengthen leadership over this work, the three secretaries and deputy secretaries of the CCP Lu'an Prefectural Committee and the heads of various departments have gone to the countryside separately to conduct inspections.

When Wang Zixuan, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, inspected the rush planting work in the Chalukou District of Huoqiu County, he discovered that an agricultural cooperative in the district, due to improper labor allocation, focused on harvesting mid-season rice and neglected planting late rice. Therefore, Wang Zixuan personally helped the agricultural cooperative arrange farm work, dividing the labor force into three teams: harvesting mid-season rice, plowing rice fields, and planting late rice. This changed the situation of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. The Youchang Production Team of the Xialou Agricultural Cooperative in this district piled up the rice before it was dried, resulting in more than 1,200 jin of rice becoming moldy and sprouting. After Wang Zixuan discovered these situations during the inspection, he promptly educated the members and immediately organized them to turn over and dry the grain.

During the inspection, the responsible persons of the Prefectural Committee also found that many agricultural cooperatives lacked fertilizer. For example, the Guanyi Agricultural Cooperative in Feixi County planted 3,700 mu of late rice, of which 2,000 mu had no base fertilizer applied. However, many other agricultural cooperatives, by using various simple and effective methods of accumulating fertilizer such as "burning pot fumigation of soil" and "shoveling turf," ensured that sufficient base fertilizer was applied to all the late autumn crop fields. After the inspection, the responsible persons of the Prefectural Committee introduced the latter effective method of accumulating fertilizer and notified the county committees, requesting each county to educate the members to apply all existing fertilizer to the late autumn crop fields.

The CCP Lu'an Prefectural Committee has been closely monitoring the work of rush planting late autumn crops, but at the same time, it also educates farmers to adapt to local conditions and be realistic in the rush planting. For some areas where mid-season rice is maturing and being harvested too late, in order to ensure the harvest of late rice and not affect winter planting, the Prefectural Committee has notified the county committees not to mechanically require farmers to force planting of late rice, but to act according to the actual situation.

    中共安徽省六安地委负责人下乡
    具体领导灾民突击抢种晚秋作物
    新华社合肥28日电　中共安徽省六安地委部分负责人，最近分头下乡，深入检查抢种晚秋作物的情况，并及时解决了抢种中的许多重要问题。
    六安专区七个县在遭受内涝和台风等灾害后，即开始突击抢种晚秋作物。到8月23日止，全专区已栽种晚稻、晚玉米、绿豆、荞麦、马铃薯等晚秋作物二百八十多万亩，达到预订计划的87.7％。现在，全专区农民正处在抢种晚秋作物的最紧张阶段。为加强对这一工作的领导，中共六安地委正副书记三人和各部部长已分头下乡进行检查。
    地委副书记王子轩到霍丘县检查岔路口区的抢种工作时，发现这个区里有一个农业社，由于劳力支配不当，抓住了抢收中稻，放松了抢栽晚稻，于是王子轩亲自帮助农业社安排了农活，把劳力分成抢收中稻、犁稻田、抢栽晚稻三套班子，这样就改变了顾此失彼的情况。这个区下楼农业社油场生产队，没有把稻子晒干就忙着堆起来，结果有一千二百多斤稻子霉烂和发芽，王子轩检查中发现这些情况后，及时向社员进行教育，并立即组织社员翻晒粮食。
    地委负责人在检查中还发现许多农业社缺乏肥料。例如肥西县管驿农业社栽三千七百亩晚稻，就有二千亩没有施基肥。而另有许多农业社，由于运用了“烧锅熏土”、“铲草皮”等多种简便易行的积肥方法，保证在晚秋作物田全施了足够的基肥。地委负责人在检查后介绍了后一种行之有效的积肥方法外，并通知各县委，要求各县教育社员把现有肥料全部追施到晚秋作物田里。
    中共六安地委对抢种晚秋作物工作抓得很紧，但同时也教育农民在抢种中要因地制宜和实事求是。对有些中稻成熟和收割过迟的地方，为了保证晚稻的收成和不影响冬种，地委已通知各县委不要机械地要求农民勉强栽下晚稻，应根据实际情况办事。
