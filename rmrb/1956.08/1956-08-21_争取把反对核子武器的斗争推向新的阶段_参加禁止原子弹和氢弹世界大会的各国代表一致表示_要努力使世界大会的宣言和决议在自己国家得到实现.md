Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 20th: Nineteen representatives from various countries attending the Second World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a press conference in Tokyo yesterday, unanimously pledging to strive to realize the declaration and resolutions of the World Conference in their own countries.

Wang Yunsheng, the Chinese representative, said that if necessary, the National People's Congress of China would also make a resolution, like the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to support the resolution of the Japanese Diet to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

British famous peace activist Mrs. Felton expressed the hope that the British Parliament would pass a resolution to support the resolution of the World Conference.

Soviet representative Sofronov said that the Soviet Union had long been prepared to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Mrs. Blum of Belgium (representative of the World Peace Council) said that now is no longer the time to discuss the resolutions of the conference, but to implement them.

Mrs. Hojer of Sweden (representative of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom) said, "I am prepared to ask the government to send more representatives, including members of parliament, to Japan to investigate the situation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

Representatives of various countries attending the World Conference will visit Japan and then return to their respective countries.

Yasui Iku, Secretary-General of the Second World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out at the press conference that the struggle against nuclear weapons will enter a new stage—the political stage. He said that in the past two years, the main focus was on collecting signatures for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the number of signatures worldwide has reached 700 million; in the future, the focus will be on making the government make practical decisions to ban nuclear weapons and stop nuclear weapons testing through the parliament.

    新华社20日讯　东京消息：出席第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的各国代表十九人昨天在东京举行记者招待会，一致保证要努力使世界大会的宣言和决议在自己的国家实现。
    中国代表王芸生说，如果有必要，中国人民代表大会也将像苏联最高苏维埃那样，作出决议，支持日本国会禁止原子弹和氢弹的决议。
    英国著名和平战士费尔顿夫人表示希望英国国会通过决议，支持世界大会的决议。
    苏联代表索弗罗诺夫说，苏联早已准备禁止原子弹和氢弹。
    比利时的布伦姆夫人（世界和平理事会代表）说，现在已经不再是讨论大会决议的时候了。而应该去执行它们。
    瑞典的霍耶尔夫人（国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟代表）说：“我准备要求政府派遣更多的代表，包括议会议员在内，来日本考察广岛和长崎的情况”。
    出席世界大会的各国代表将在日本参观访问后陆续回国。
  第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会秘书长安井郁在记者招待会上指出，反对核子武器的斗争将进入新的阶段——政治阶段。他说，前两年主要致力于征集禁止核子武器的签名方面，全世界签名人数已经达到七亿；今后将着重于通过国会使政府作出实际禁止核子武器和停止核子武器试验的决定。
