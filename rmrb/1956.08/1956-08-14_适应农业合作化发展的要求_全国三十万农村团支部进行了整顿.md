    Xinhua News Agency, 13th. To adapt to the development of agricultural cooperation, approximately 300,000 rural Communist Youth League branches across the country have undergone rectification in the past six months.
    This rectification work was carried out in accordance with the "Resolution on Mobilizing and Organizing the Broad Masses of Rural Youth to Greet the High Tide of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in October of last year. At that time, the rural Communist Youth League organizations, whether in terms of the organizational leadership of the branches or in terms of the quantity and quality of the league members, could not keep up with the requirements of the development of cooperativization. Therefore, it was necessary to rectify the rural Communist Youth League branches.
    During the rectification, many regions implemented the spirit of adhering to education. Through studying and discussing the principles and policies of agricultural cooperativization and the role that the Communist Youth League organizations and the Communist Youth League members should play in agricultural cooperativization, the awareness of the league members was enhanced. At the same time, in conjunction with the inspection of work, democracy was promoted, and commendations and criticisms were carried out.
    After the rectification of the rural Communist Youth League branches, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of league members for production was further enhanced. After Guangxi Province rectified the work of the Youth League branch, the Youth League members requested to join the youth shock brigades. In this context, Guilin Prefecture established 1,497 youth shock brigades with more than 32,000 youth shock brigade members. These youth shock brigades played a leading role in production activities such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. On the first day after Heping Township in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, rectified the Youth League branch, 1,800 people participated in the youth shock brigade. The members reclaimed 1,200 mu of wasteland in four days. Youth League members in many areas also took the lead in joining agricultural production cooperatives. After the rectification in Yinchuan Prefecture, Gansu Province, 98% of the Youth League members joined the advanced agricultural production cooperatives. In Yongning County, Gansu Province, there were originally 118 Youth League members who had not joined the cooperative; at this time, they all actively requested to take the road of cooperativization and all joined the cooperative.
    After the rectification, the prestige of the rural Communist Youth League organizations among the broad masses of young people was further enhanced, and the young people requested to join the League. In the forty days after the rectification of the League in Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu Province, 11,861 Youth League members were developed. Most of these new League members were young activists who emerged in the agricultural cooperativization movement. Before the rectification of the Youth League branch in Guilin Prefecture, Guangxi Province, there were only 44 Youth League general branch committees; after the rectification, the number increased to 111 Youth League general branch committees.

    适应农业合作化发展的要求
    全国三十万农村团支部进行了整顿
    新华社13日讯　全国已有三十万个左右的农村青年团支部在最近半年多的时间内进行了一次整顿。
    这次整顿工作，是根据去年十月的中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会第四次全体会议关于动员和组织广大农村青年迎接农业合作化高潮的决议进行的。当时，农村青年团组织不论在支部的组织领导上，在团员的数量和质量上，都赶不上合作化发展的要求，因此必须对农村青年团支部进行整顿。
    在整顿时，许多地区都贯彻了坚持教育的精神，通过对农业合作化方针政策以及青年团组织和青年团员在农业合作化中应起的作用等问题的学习和讨论，提高了团员的觉悟，并且结合检查工作，发扬了民主，进行了表扬和批评。
    经过对农村青年团支部的整顿，广大青年团员的生产积极性更加提高了。广西省在整顿团支部工作以后，青年团员纷纷要求参加青年突击队。桂林专区就在这种情况下，建立了1，497个青年突击队。有三万二千多名青年突击队员。这些青年突击队在兴修水利、积肥等生产活动中都起了带头作用。湖北省黄冈专区和平乡整顿青年团支部后的第一天，就有一千八百人参加了青年突击队。队员们在四天内开垦荒地一千二百亩。许多地区的青年团员还带头加入农业生产合作社。甘肃省银川专区在整顿以后有98％的青年团员参加了高级农业生产合作社。甘肃省的永宁县原来有118名青年团员没有入社，这时都积极要求走合作化的道路，全部入了社。
    经过整顿以后，农村青年团组织在广大青年群众中的威信更加提高，青年们纷纷要求入团。甘肃省天水专区在整团后的四十天中就发展了11，861名青年团员，这些新团员中大部分是在农业合作化运动中涌现出来的青年积极分子。广西省桂林专区在整顿团支部工作以前，只有四十四个青年团总支委员会；整顿后增加到111个青年团总支委员会。
