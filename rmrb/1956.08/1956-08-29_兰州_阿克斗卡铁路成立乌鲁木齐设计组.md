Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 26th: The Urumqi Design Group for the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway was established yesterday.

This group is composed of a portion of engineers and staff recently dispatched by the Lanzhou First Railway Design Institute, as well as over 300 engineers and design technicians from the Hami-Urumqi and Urumqi-Alashankou sections. They will be responsible for the railway design work within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, from Hami to Alashankou on the border.

Liu Tieyan, chief engineer of the Urumqi Design Group, told reporters that the survey and design work for the Hami-Alashankou railway is adopting a method of "one survey, two-stage design." After the preliminary design is approved, construction can begin, advancing the construction timeline by one year compared to the original plan. It is expected that the entire preliminary design for the Hami-Alashankou section will be basically completed before the end of this year.

Currently, the fixed survey for the railway from Urumqi to Alashankou on the border has been completed. The fixed survey work for the Hami-Urumqi section will also be basically completed before the end of August, and most of the fixed survey data has already been submitted. Design preparation work also began on August 22nd.

    兰州—阿克斗卡铁路成立乌鲁木齐设计组
    新华社乌鲁木齐26日电　兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路乌鲁木齐设计组在昨天成立。
    这个组由兰州第一铁路设计院最近派来的一部分工程师、工作人员，和哈密到乌鲁木齐、乌鲁木齐到阿拉山口段的工程师和设计技术人员等三百多人组成。他们将担任新疆维吾尔自治区境内由哈密到国境阿拉山口的铁路设计工作。
    乌鲁木齐设计组总工程师刘铁岩对记者说，哈密到阿拉山口铁路的勘测和设计工作，是采取了一次勘测、两阶段设计的工作方法，初步设计批准后，就可以施工，施工时间比原计划可以提前一年。预计哈密到国境阿拉山口的全部初步设计，将于今年年底以前基本完成。
    现在，从乌鲁木齐到国境阿拉山口的铁路已经定测完毕；哈密到乌鲁木齐的定测工作也将在八月底前基本结束，绝大部分定测资料已经交出。从8月22日起，设计准备工作也开始了。
