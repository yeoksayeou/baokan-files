    五名女射击运动员
    达到或超过运动健将标准
    据新华社18日讯　正在北京举行的射击运动员选拔表演赛，今天在进行完女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺距离立、跪、卧姿射击表演赛时，有五名运动员的成绩达到或超过了中国运动健将级五百六十环的标准。
    河北省二十一岁的女运动员曹靖芬今天以射中571环的成绩获得第一名。她的成绩已经接近苏联运动员科尔穆什金娜去年在北京参加国际友谊射击竞赛获得第一名时创造的575环的纪录。
    北京市选手傅均洁获得第二名，她射中了565环。内蒙古自治区的选手陆桂珍，564环；江西省选手胡智，562环；浙江省选手李素萍，560环。
    女子射击比赛目前还没有被列为奥林匹克运动会的竞赛项目。因此，这次的女子比赛是表演性质的，同选拔参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的中国射击选手无关。
