    An Egyptian Travelogue

    (9) In Alexandria
    The Mediterranean's surging waves rushed over. The green, black, and golden waters crashed like a thousand troops against the twenty-mile coastline of Alexandria. Waves splashed several yards high on the shore, and the palm trees by the coast drooped their broad leaves like open umbrellas.

    Alexandria was founded in the 300s BC during the reign of Alexander the Great of the Macedonian Empire over Egypt. The city's architecture is extremely diverse, featuring Greek, Roman, ancient Egyptian Pharaonic, and Arabic styles.

    It is Egypt's largest commercial port and outlet to the sea, as well as its second-largest city. The harbor is located at the city's eastern end, with cargo ships docked at the wharves and dockworkers carrying heavy loads. A canal diverted from the Nile River leads to the sea. Although Alexandria's population of over 800,000 does not live on the banks of the Nile, they still drink its water. Wooden boats carrying cotton slowly navigate the canal towards the seaport docks, where the cotton is then shipped abroad.

    During World War II, German forces approached within about 100 kilometers of the city, and Hitler's German bomber squadrons came here to bomb. In the urban area of Alexandria, we still saw some bombed-out ruins. Farmeir, the Egyptian government official who accompanied us on the city tour, said: "From 1941 to 1944, we spent very bleak years in Alexandria, spending almost every night in air-raid shelters."

    In 1940, Italian fascist General Graziani invaded British forces in Egypt with an army of 200,000. Graziani failed. Then German fascist General Rommel appeared on the African battlefield. On June 13, 1942, the British army suffered a disastrous defeat in a battle, with 230 tanks destroyed in a single day. Hitler's destiny to seize North Africa seemed to be set, and Nazi German generals arrived within sixty miles of Alexandria. The Suez Canal area and the whole of Egypt were also in danger.

    However, in the distant Soviet Union, Hitler's millions of troops threw themselves at Stalingrad, and the heroic sons and daughters of the Soviets ultimately saved the world from Hitler's enslavement. At that time, Rommel requested aid from Berlin, threatening to take Egypt in one fell swoop, but the defeat at the Stalingrad front prevented Rommel from carrying out his African campaign, and Rommel's divisions finally collapsed in Africa.

    If it had not been for the Battle of Stalingrad, or if the battle had occurred later, then what we see in Alexandria today might not just be traces of ruins.

    In the streets of Alexandria, advertisements for American movies are even more rampant than in Cairo. Farmeir, who accompanied us on the city tour, told us: "American movies flood the free market here, British movies have been defeated, and I haven't seen a British film in four years. Currently, the Egyptian film industry is developing, so the public's interest in American movies is greatly diminishing." The streets are full of gas stations for taxis, all of which are British "Shell" and American "Vacuum," etc. The advertisements for Coca-Cola are equally startling.

    We walked along the coast of Alexandria, occasionally encountering a few Egyptian sailors. British sailors can no longer be seen here. Shortly after British warships bombarded Alexandria in the Mediterranean Sea in 1882, Alexandria became a British naval port. Farmeir sank into painful memories: "During the British rule, when I was still young, I often saw Egyptian parades and demonstrations in the streets, and the colonial army used bullets against the unarmed Egyptians, and blood flowed all over the streets. The coastline was full of British army barracks..."

    "But now the colonial army has been driven out by us." Farmeir was filled with a sense of pride. (Attached picture)

    埃及纪游

    （九）在亚历山大
    地中海汹涌澎湃的海浪奔袭过来了。那绿色的黑色的和金光闪闪的海水像千军万马冲击着二十哩长的亚历山大港的海岸线。海岸上飞溅着数丈高的浪花，岸边的棕梠树像张开的伞一样地下垂着它的宽大的枝叶。
    亚历山大，是在纪元前三百多年时马其顿帝国亚历山大大帝统治埃及时建立起来的。市内的房屋建筑是非常多样的，那里有希腊式的、罗马式的、古埃及的法老式和阿拉伯式的各种建筑物。
    这是埃及的一个最大的商港和出海口，也是埃及的第二大城市。市的东端是海港，码头上停泊着货船，码头工人背荷着沉重的货物。从尼罗河引来了一条运河，通向大海。亚历山大市八十多万居民虽然不住在尼罗河畔，但仍饮用尼罗河的水。运河上徐徐地行驶着载着棉花的木船，驶向海港码头，然后转运到国外去。
    第二次世界大战期间，德军曾逼近市郊约百公里，希特勒德国的轰炸机群也到这里来进行轰炸。在亚城的市区内我们还见到一些被轰炸的颓壁残瓦。陪同我们参观市容的埃及政府官员法米尔说：“从1941—1944年，我们在亚历山大度过了十分凄凉的年月，几乎每夜都是在防空壕里度过的。”
    1940年意大利法西斯将军格拉齐亚尼以二十万大军进攻在埃及的英军。格拉齐亚尼失败了。于是德国法西斯将军隆美尔出现在非洲战场上。1942年6月13日，英军在一次战役中惨败，一日之间被毁坦克二百三十辆。希特勒攫取北非的命运似乎已经定了，纳粹德国的将军来到了距亚历山大才六十哩外的地方。苏彝士运河区及整个埃及也在危急中。
    可是，在遥远的苏联，希特勒的数百万大军扑向斯大林格勒，苏维埃的英雄儿女最后拯救了全世界免于受希特勒奴役的命运。当时，隆美尔向柏林求援，扬言一举而下埃及，但在斯大林格勒前线的失利使隆美尔无法执行他的非洲作战计划，隆美尔师团终于在非洲溃退了。
    如果没有斯大林格勒战役，或者这个战役发生得较晚一些，那末，今天我们所看到的亚城也许不仅仅是一点点颓瓦的痕迹了。
    在亚历山大的街头，美国电影的广告甚至比开罗还要凶些。陪同我们参观市容的法米尔告诉我们：“这里美国电影充斥着自由市场，英国电影已经被击败，我已经有四年没有看到一部英国的片子了。目前埃及电影业正在发展，这样，公众对美国电影的兴趣正在大大地减退。”街上到处是出租汽车的加油站，都是英国的“壳牌”和美国的“真空牌”等等。可口可乐的广告同样是怵目惊心的。
    我们沿着亚城海边走去，偶尔遇到几个埃及的水兵。这里已不再能见到英国水兵了。自从1882年英国军舰在地中海上炮击亚城后不久，亚城便成为英国人的军港。法米尔沉入了痛心的回忆：“英国统治时期，那时我还年幼，常见街上埃及人的游行示威，殖民军用枪弹对付赤手空拳的埃及人，鲜血流满了街道。沿着岸边，布满了英军的营房……。”
    “但是，现在殖民军已经被我们撵出去了。”法米尔充满了自豪的感情。（附图片）
