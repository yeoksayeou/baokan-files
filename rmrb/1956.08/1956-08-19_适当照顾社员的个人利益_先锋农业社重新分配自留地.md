Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 17th: The Kunming Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative, led by Yunnan Province's renowned labor model Ruan Ziyun, re-addressed the issue of private plots during the summer rectification, ensuring appropriate consideration for the personal interests of its members.

After the 1,120 member households joined this advanced cooperative this spring, their private plots were all abolished. This was because cooperative cadres feared that members keeping small plots of land would "develop capitalism." For more than half a year, the vegetables that members ate every day had to be distributed by the production team every four or five days. Each time vegetables were distributed, more than a thousand households had to line up in several long queues, with each person spending half a day. Members not only couldn't eat fresh vegetables but also saw an impact on their production and labor point income. Members who used to grow some native tobacco for their own consumption on their private plots had to buy cigarettes in the streets. Some members who raised small livestock also lacked feed, so many members had to plant chili peppers on the drying grounds or grow melons on graves. However, the cooperative found it difficult to organize production management of these scattered private plots, and most of the seeds sown did not yield a harvest. In addition, every time members received vegetables, the cooperative had to record it and deduct labor points, and each month it had to pay for the labor points of the people in the production team responsible for distributing vegetables. The members were very dissatisfied.

In early July, at the members' representative assembly, members raised their opinions requesting a re-addressing of the private plot issue. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the cooperative cadres first examined the problem of neglecting the personal interests of the members and reviewed the series of problems that had occurred after the abolition of private plots. At the representative assembly, they decided to re-allocate private plots. As a result of the allocation: the private plots distributed to all members of the cooperative accounted for 3% of the average land per person in the local area (the local land is scarce, with an average of only one mu per person). Elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, and disabled members were all allocated small plots of land near their residences. The 120 households who did not have private plots in the elementary cooperative also received private plots this time.

### 适当照顾社员的个人利益  先锋农业社重新分配自留地

    适当照顾社员的个人利益
    先锋农业社重新分配自留地
    据新华社昆明17日电　云南省著名劳动模范阮自云领导的昆明先锋农业生产合作社，在夏季整社中重新处理了自留地问题，使社员个人利益得到适当的照顾。
    一千一百二十户社员自今年春天参加了这个高级社后，应有的自留地统统被取消了。原因是由于社干部怕社员留着一小块土地“发展资本主义”。半年多来，社员们每天吃的蔬菜，就得由生产队每隔四五天分一次。每分一次菜，一千多户社员又得排成若干个长长的队，每人花上半天的时间。社员们不仅吃不到新鲜蔬菜，还影响了生产和劳动工分的收入。过去在自留地上栽点土烟自己吃的社员，吃烟也得到街上去买，有的社员养些小家畜也缺少饲料，许多社员只好在晒场上栽辣子、坟头上种麦瓜。而合作社对这些零星分散的自留地，却很难组织生产管理，播下的籽种大多没有收成。再加上社员每次分得蔬菜要由合作社记账、扣工分，每个月还要支出一笔生产队中负责分菜的人的工分。社员很不满意。
    七月上旬，在社员代表大会上，社员提出了要求重新处理自留地的意见。社干部在中共党支部的领导下，首先检查了忽视社员个人利益的问题，回顾了取消自留地后所发生的一系列的问题，在代表大会上决定重新分配自留地。分配结果：全社社员分得的自留地占当地每人平均土地数的3％（当地土地较少，平均每人只有一亩）。老弱、孤寡、残废的社员都分得了住宅附近的小片土地。在初级社时就没有自留地的一百二十户社员，这次也分得了自留地。
