Let's talk about Dragons and Jiaos
Zhou Jianren

The vast majority of people know the name of the dragon. Many people can describe its shape. Mud and water workers in the South can even paint a "ink dragon" on the wall or in front of the stove with a brush. However, there has never been such an animal in the world; it only exists in people's imagination. Some people may ask: if there are no dragons on earth, why are "dragon bones" sold in Chinese medicine stores? Someone has studied that the so-called "dragon bones" are fossil bones and teeth of several unrelated animals. Some may also say that the dragon in imagination may be the memory of some ancient dinosaurs left by the ancients. But the era when dinosaurs lived was very far away from humans, and the two did not meet, so there could be no such memory.

However, imagined things cannot be imagined out of thin air. There must be some basis, plus distortion, fabrication, and embellishment to become an imagined thing that is not real.

In summer, narrow and urgent cyclones occur on the sea surface; from a distance, it looks like something hangs down from the clouds to the sea surface, and it looks like it is twisting. Commonly called "dragon sucks water," it refers to the dragon hanging down from the clouds and sucking water from the sea. In books, it is called "tornado." Tornadoes are a basis for people to imagine that there are dragons in the world.

Some stone tablets are often carved with dragons. The shapes are somewhat different. Some are simpler, and some are more complex. When Lu Xun lived in the Shaoxing Guild Hall in Beijing, he often copied rubbings in his spare time. He once told me that one kind of dragon shape on the stele is very similar to a crocodile. Indeed, several kinds of large reptiles were given the title of dragon in ancient times, such as the Yangtze River crocodile, which was anciently called Tuo Long, and the Jiao was also called Jiao Long. Therefore, we have reason to speculate that animals like crocodiles are the basis for the imagination of dragons. To sum up, the imagination of the dragon is composed of images such as crocodiles and "tornadoes." Or there are other factors, but it is certain that there is no real object.

Now let's talk about Jiaos along the way. In the old days, it was said in the folk customs of eastern Zhejiang that the Jiao was the son of a dragon. Eastern Zhejiang has many mountains, and after a long period of rain, there are often "mountain torrents." That is, a large amount of water accumulated in the mountains suddenly rushes down, which is called "coming out of the flood." Sometimes people and animals are washed away. Popular belief is that the Jiao is shaped like a small pig, and it flows down with the water during the flood, enters the sea from the river, and then transforms into a dragon and ascends to the sky. This story is obviously a bit incoherent. Since dragons often live in the clouds and also live on the seabed (popularly said that the Dragon Palace is on the seabed), why are the sons produced in the underground layers of the mountains? But this situation is not surprising, because it is not scientific knowledge, but just absurd superstition.

However, the Jiao is not an imaginary animal, but a real object. A huge lizard-like animal is produced in southern China and the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines and other places. The body is very large, and the large ones are more than two meters long. The head is relatively small; the neck is long and can be stretched and retracted. There are transverse black linear stripes on the snout and cheeks. Limbs are developed and the body is swollen. The tail is long and slightly flattened laterally. Records say that the body is dark brown with yellow-black spots on the back and yellow on the abdomen. The throat is yellow with black spots. The tip of the tongue is forked, and when walking, it sticks out its tongue. Li Shizhen said in the "Compendium of Materia Medica": "According to Pei Yuan's Guangzhou Ji, the Jiao is more than ten feet long, similar to a snake with four feet, shaped as wide as a shield, with a small head and thin neck..." The description of the shape is quite similar (the following description is not very similar, so it is omitted). It lives on the ground, in the water, or in trees, and eats small animals. It lays eggs in tree holes. It can lay eggs, which the ancients already knew, and the Guangzhou Ji said that "its eggs are also large." But it also said that it "can lead fish to fly," which is also wrong.

This animal is also in the Beijing Zoo, and the name written on the sign is "Marsh Monitor." This name is found in the zoological dictionary and was fabricated by the editors, probably because it is a lizard-like animal, very large, and often lives in marshes. But this name is obviously not as eye-catching and interesting as the original name "Jiao."

    谈谈龙和蛟
    周建人
    极大多数人都知道龙这名字。许多人能讲说它作什么形状。南方的泥水工人还能用毛笔在墙上或灶前画出一条“水墨龙”。然而世界上却并不曾有过这样的动物，它只存在人的想像中。有人会这样问：地球上没有龙，为什么中药铺里有“龙骨”出卖呢？曾经有人研究过，所谓“龙骨”是几种不相干的动物的化石骨头和牙齿。又有人可能说，想像中的龙也许是古人对于某种古代恐龙遗留下来的记忆。但恐龙生存的时代距离人类很遥远，二者没有碰过面，不可能有这记忆的。
    可是想像的东西也不是完全凭空能够想像起来的。也须有一些依据，加上歪曲、假造和附会便成为一种并非实有的想像的东西。
    夏季海面上会发生幅面较狭小的紧急的旋风；远远望去像有一条东西从云间挂下来到海面，看去像在扭动。俗叫“龙吸水”，指龙从云端下挂、向海吸水的意思。书上则称“龙卷风”。龙卷风是人们想像世上有龙的一种凭借。
    有些石碑上面常常凿着龙。形状多少有些不同。有的简单些，有的复杂些。鲁迅早先住在北京绍兴会馆里的时候，有一时期，暇时经常抄碑帖。他曾经对我说过，碑上有种龙形是很像鳄鱼的。的确，有数种大形的爬虫，古代都给以龙的称号，如扬子江鳄古称鼍龙，蛟又称蛟龙。所以我们有理由推想，鳄鱼这类动物是龙这想像物的凭借。综括起来说，龙的想像是由鳄鱼、“龙卷风”等形象而构成的。或者还有别的因素，但并无实物则是可以肯定的。
    现在连带讲到蛟。旧时浙东俗说蛟是龙子。浙东多山，久雨以后，常有“山洪暴发”的事情。即山中积水突然大量冲下，叫做“出洪”。有时把人、畜冲去。俗信蛟形如小猪，出洪时跟水流下，由江入海，后化为龙，飞升上天。这故事显然有点头尾不接。龙既常在云端，也常常住在海底（俗说龙宫在海底），为什么子却产在山中地层下面？但这种情况不足为奇，因为它并不是科学知识，只是无稽的迷信。
    可是蛟却并不是想像动物，是有实物的。我国南部及马来半岛、菲律宾等处产一种巨大的晰蜴类动物。身体很长大，大的达二公尺余。头部比较小形；颈部长，能伸缩。吻及颊部有横行黑色线状斑纹。四肢发达，体膨大。尾长，略略侧扁。记载上说，体呈暗褐色，背上有黄黑色斑，腹下黄色。喉部黄色、有黑点。舌端分叉，行走时，一伸一伸地吐着舌头。“本草纲目”上，李时珍说：“按裴渊广州记云：蛟长丈余，似蛇而四足，形广如楯，小头细颈……”形状的描写颇肖似（以下的描写不大像，故省去了）。它栖息在地面上，水中，或树上，吃小动物。卵生在树洞里。它能产卵，古人也已知道了，广州记上说“其卵亦大”。但又说它“能率鱼飞”，则又不对了。
    这种动物北京动物园里也有，牌子上写的名字是“泽巨蜥”。这名称见于动物学大辞典上，是编者们杜撰的，大概因为它是蜥蜴类动物，又很巨大，且常栖息在沼泽地的缘故。但这名称显然不及原来的名字“蛟”的引人注意与感兴趣。
