Xinhua News Agency, August 9th. The Ministry of Higher Education has decided to select a group of candidates who were not admitted in this year's national unified enrollment examination for higher education institutions to serve as teaching assistants in universities and colleges and as a reserve force for faculty.

This year, national universities and colleges will supplement their teaching staff with six thousand assistants (part of whom will be recruited from junior high school graduates). Starting this year, the situation where teaching assistants cannot meet the needs of teaching and scientific research work will be gradually improved.

Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, Chongqing University, and twenty-one other universities will recruit an additional six hundred candidates who were not admitted in the national unified enrollment examination for higher education institutions. The recruited students will be trained by these schools to become drafting teachers, in order to supplement the shortage of drafting faculty in various universities and colleges.

National secondary specialized schools will also recruit more than five thousand seven hundred candidates who were not admitted in the national unified enrollment examination for higher education institutions, and the schools will be responsible for training them to become teachers of general courses.

    新华社9日讯　高等教育部决定在今年全国高等学校统一招生未录取的考生中，选取一批人作为高等学校的教学辅助人员和师资的后备力量。
    全国高等学校今年将补充教学辅助人员六千人（其中一部分将招收初中毕业生）。从今年起，教学辅助人员不能满足教学和科学研究工作需要的情况，将逐步得到改善。
    清华大学、天津大学、重庆大学等二十一所高等学校，今年将从全国高等学校统一招生未录取的考生中再招收六百名。招收的这一部分学生将由这些学校负责培养为制图教师，以补充各高等学校制图师资的不足。
    全国中等专业学校也将从全国高等学校统一招生未录取的考生中招收五千七百多人，由学校负责培养为普通课的师资。
