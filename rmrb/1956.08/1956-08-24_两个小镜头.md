Two Short Scenes

    Talking About "Experience"
    In an organization, a young person called the admissions committee to inquire about the admission of candidates. After finally getting through, the young person said angrily, "It's outrageous! They hung up before I finished speaking." A person with a lot of experience making phone calls took the opportunity to impart their experience, saying, "If he (referring to the other party) hangs up, don't hang up. This way, you occupy their line, and they can't do anything about it. They can't dial out, and outsiders can't dial in. Even the telephone bureau can't do anything." Then, they used their own practical experience as an example to prove the reliability of this experience. Li Yuan
        Who's So Great?
    A county-level unit received a batch of college students in 1955. These people were assigned to rural areas to do horse insurance work. Because this work only involved signing forms, these college students made suggestions to the leaders, requesting that they be used rationally. Who knew that the leader of this unit would actually say, "Besides knowing a few more Chinese characters, what's so great about college students?" Zhang Nanxiong

    两个小镜头
    谈“经验”
    在一个机关里，有一个青年给招生委员会打电话，询问关于考生录取的问题。好不容易电话才挂通了，但不一会，这青年就气呼呼地说：“真不像话，还没有说完话，他们就把电话挂了。”旁边一位富有打电话经验的人就乘机传播经验说：“如他（指对方）挂了，你不要挂，这样占他一条线，他干急没法子：他也打不出来，外边也打不进去，就连电话局也没有法治。”接着还以自己实践的经验作例来证实这经验的可靠。　李　垣
        谁了不起？
    某一县级单位在1955年分到一批大学生。这些人被分配到农村作马匹保险工作。由于这一工作仅仅是签签单据，这些大学生便向领导提出意见，要求合理使用他们。谁知这个单位的领导人竟说：“除了多认识几个汉字，大学生又有什么了不起。”　张南雄
