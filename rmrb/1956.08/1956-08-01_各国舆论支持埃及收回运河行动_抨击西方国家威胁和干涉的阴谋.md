Czechoslovakia
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th. "Red Right" wrote today, welcoming the recent action by the Egyptian government to nationalize the International Suez Canal Company, that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company will strengthen Egypt's economic power and its independence. Revenue from the Suez Canal will promote Egypt's national economy and industrialization, and will improve the lives of the Egyptian people.

The newspaper emphasized that "Egypt is determined to defend its rights and independence with all its might," a determination that is warmly supported by Asian and African countries and peace-loving people around the world, including the people of Czechoslovakia.

Vietnam
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st. The news of Egypt's announcement to nationalize the Suez Canal continues to be headline news in Hanoi newspapers and is being praised.

Today's "New Era Newspaper" published a commentary, believing that Egypt has the right to nationalize the Suez Canal. It said that the income of the Suez Canal should belong to the Egyptian people who have been struggling against imperialism for more than seventy years. Egypt is qualified to cancel the unequal treaties that were imposed on it under the bayonet and through blackmail.

"Hanoi Daily" pointed out in its commentary on this event: The imperialists have suffered a severe setback in Egypt.

Yugoslavia
Xinhua News Agency, 30th, Belgrade, according to the Yugoslav News Agency. Today's "Combat Daily" emphasized that the Egyptian government has the right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. The newspaper believes in a commentary that the relevant parties should resolve any disputes that may arise from this issue through consultation.

"Politics Daily" emphasized that Egypt has the right to nationalize foreign property (even the International Suez Canal Company) on its territory. The newspaper said that all those who hope to ease the tension in the Middle East are concerned today that new and even more serious complicated problems should be avoided in the Suez Canal. When the representatives of the three Western countries are discussing their future policy direction towards Egypt, it may be worthwhile to reiterate that some past high-pressure measures have not led to positive results, but have only caused unnecessary difficulties for all parties.

India
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th. Indian newspapers continue to criticize the actions taken by Western countries against Egypt on the issue of the nationalization of the Suez Canal.

The Bombay "Free Press" published an editorial entitled "The Claws Are Out," saying: "The thunderous performance shows that behind the hypocritical claim of resisting Russia in Asia, the old imperialist goals have not disappeared at all, and they will drop their masks at the first opportunity and pick up the whip."

The newspaper said that the West has revealed its claws on the Suez Canal issue. Any Asian country that still has a certain amount of foreign capital in its country cannot forget this. What the West is fighting for in the struggle is not the "hearts" of Asia, but things that can be taken to feed the bodies of Westerners.

The Bengali newspaper "Epoch-Making Daily" said in its editorial: "In Egypt's current courageous struggle against Western countries, we wish Egypt complete success and salute its national leaders and the newly awakened masses. Let the Suez Canal be the beginning of a new tide of national liberation in Asia and Africa."

Burma
Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 31st. "Yangon Daily" said in an article on the 29th, "Nasser's step of nationalizing the Suez Canal is drastic, but it can be said that Egypt should do this because the canal company has enjoyed profits for eighty-six years."

Commenting on the possibility of British troops reoccupying the Suez Canal area, the newspaper said that if Britain sends troops to the Suez Canal because of Egypt's action to nationalize the canal, it would be a violation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty.

The newspaper also said that, on the other hand, if the United Kingdom, the United States, and France attempt to create a war by inciting the disputing parties on the Israeli-Jordan issue, then they will be responsible for launching the war.

Indonesia
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 31st. Indonesian newspapers continued to publish comments on the 30th supporting Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

"Social Messenger" said that Western countries are still considering the losses they have suffered due to Egypt's actions, without considering the emotions of the Egyptian people who have been suffering from the loss of the canal.

"Greater Indonesia Daily" said that Egypt's actions are admirable. This action is a correct answer to the withdrawal of US and UK aid to the Aswan Dam.

Commenting on the possibility of retaliatory action by Western countries, the newspaper wrote that the world today is no longer the world of one hundred and fifty years ago.

Ceylon
Xinhua News Agency, 31st. Colombo News: "Ceylon Times" published a commentary yesterday saying that Egypt's right as a sovereign country to nationalize the Suez Canal cannot be ignored. "Therefore, when Britain and France protest against Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, they are unrealistic."

The same day's "Daily News" believed that the situation caused by Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal has the danger of causing war. It warned that if the West uses force against Egypt, or even threatens it with force, it will only arouse the resentment of Asian nationalism.

The newspaper also said that Colombo countries, which have friendly relations with both Egypt and Britain, should be prepared to mediate when necessary to maintain peace in the Middle East.

Pakistan
Xinhua News Agency, 31st. Karachi News: The Urdu daily "New Era" in Lahore published an editorial on July 29th saying: This courageous step by the Egyptian President is another hot slap in the face of the imperialists.

On the same day, the English daily "Pakistan Times" in Lahore also published an editorial saying that Western countries must realize that the era of supranational commercial companies ruling and exploiting countries as masters has passed. Gunboat diplomacy can no longer be tolerated. Egypt and other Asian countries are now strong enough to resist this intimidation, and the world's non-imperialist bloc is strong enough to stop imperialist aggression.

Greece
Xinhua News Agency, 29th. According to Agence France-Presse, Athens: The Greek government newspaper "National Daily" in Athens published a commentary on July 28 saying that Greece will not participate in any retaliatory action that the United States, Britain, and France may launch against Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The newspaper also accused Western countries of using the wrong policy of "pressure" against Egypt and other Arab countries.

    各国舆论支持埃及收回运河行动
    抨击西方国家威胁和干涉的阴谋
    捷克斯洛伐克
    新华社布拉格28日电“红色权利报”今天在欢迎埃及政府最近采取的把国际苏彝士运河收归国有的行动的时候写道，苏彝士运河公司的国有化将加强埃及的经济力量和它的独立。从苏彝士运河得到的收入将促进埃及的国民经济和工业化的发展，并且将改善埃及人民的生活。
    这家报纸着重指出，“埃及决心以全力保卫它的权利和独立”，这种决心是得到亚非国家和全世界爱好和平的人民，包括捷克斯洛伐克人民在内的热烈同情的。
    越　南
    新华社河内31日电　埃及宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有的消息继续成为河内报纸上的大标题的新闻，并且得到赞扬。
    今天的“新时代报”发表评论，认为埃及有权利把苏彝士运河国有化。它说，苏彝士运河的收入应该属于七十多年来一直在对帝国主义进行斗争的埃及人民。埃及有资格取消在刺刀尖下和通过讹诈强加在它身上的不平等条约。
    “河内日报”在评论这一事件时指出：帝国主义者在埃及遭受到剧烈的挫折。
    南斯拉夫
    新华社30日据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德消息　今天的“战斗报”强调指出，埃及政府有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有。这家报纸在一篇评论中认为，有关各方面应该通过协商办法来解决这个问题所可能引起的争端。
    “政治报”强调指出，埃及是有权利把在它领土上的外国财产（即使是国际苏彝士运河公司）收归国有的。这家报纸说，所有希望缓和中东紧张局势的人今天所关心的是：应该避免在苏彝士运河方面引起新的、甚至更严重的复杂问题。当西方三国的代表正在讨论它们今后对埃及的政策的方针的时候，不妨重提一下，过去的一些高压措施并没有导致积极的结果，而只是对所有方面造成了不必要的困难。
    印度
    据新华社新德里30日电　印度报纸继续抨击西方国家在苏彝士运河国有化问题上对埃及采取的行动。
    孟买“自由新闻”以“露出爪子来了”为题，发表社论说：“大发雷霆的表现表明：在所提出的什么在亚洲抵制俄国的虚伪说法后面，旧的帝国主义目的仍然一点没有消失，一有机会就会丢掉假面具，抓起皮鞭子来。”
    这家报纸说，西方在苏彝士运河问题上露出了自己的爪子。任何亚洲国家，只要是自己国内仍然有一定的外国资本，都不可忘记这一点。西方在斗争中所争夺的，并不是什么亚洲的“人心”，而是可以拿去喂养西方人身体的东西。
    孟加拉文日报“划时代报”的社论说：“在埃及目前对西方国家进行的勇敢的斗争中，我们祝埃及完全成功，并且向它的国家领导人和新觉醒的群众致敬。让苏彝士运河成为亚洲和非洲新的民族解放潮流的开端吧。”
    缅甸
    据新华社仰光31日电　“仰光日报”二十九日在一篇文章中说，“纳赛尔把苏彝士运河收归国有的步骤是剧烈的，但是可以说，埃及应该做这件事，因为运河公司已经享受利润八十六年了。”
    这家报纸在评论英国军队可能再次占领苏彝士运河区的时候说，如果英国由于埃及采取把这条运河收归国有的行动而派遣军队前往苏彝士运河，它就是违反英埃协定。
    这家报纸又说，另一方面，如果英美法三国企图用煽动以色列—约旦问题各争执方面的办法来制造战争的话，那么它们将要负起发动战争的责任。
    印度尼西亚
    据新华社雅加达31日电　印度尼西亚报纸在三十日继续发表评论支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有。
    “社会使者报”说，西方国家仍在考虑由于埃及的这个行动而使它们遭受的损失，而没有考虑一直蒙受着丧失运河之苦的埃及人民的情绪。
    “大印度尼西亚报”说，埃及的行动是令人钦佩的。这种行动是对英美撤销援助阿斯旺水坝的一个正确的回答。
    这家报纸在评论西方国家可能采取报复行动时写道，现在的世界已不再是一百五十年以前的那个世界了。
    锡兰
    据新华社31日讯　科伦坡消息：“锡兰时报”昨天发表评论说，埃及作为一个主权国把苏彝士运河收归国有的权利是不能漠视的。“因此，当英国和法国对埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有一事提出抗议的时候，他们是不现实的”。
    同一天的“每日新闻”认为埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有所造成的局势有引起战争的危险。它警告说，西方如果对埃及使用武力，或者甚至是以武力来威胁的话，这只会引起亚洲民族主义的愤恨。
    这家报纸又说，同埃及和英国都有友好关系的科伦坡国家应当准备在必要时进行斡旋，以维持中东的和平。
    巴基斯坦
    据新华社31日讯　喀喇蚩消息：拉合尔的乌尔都文日报“新时代报”七月二十九日发表社论说：埃及总统的这一果敢步骤，使帝国主义者脸上又挨了热辣辣的一巴掌。
    同一天，拉合尔的英文日报“巴基斯坦时报”也发表社论说，西方国家必须认识到，统治和剥削作为主人的国家的超国家的商业公司的时代已经过去了。炮舰外交再也不能被容忍的了。埃及和其他亚洲国家今天已经强大到足以抗拒这种威吓，世界的非帝国主义集团已经强大到足以阻止帝国主义的侵略行动。
    希　腊
    新华社29日讯　据法新社雅典消息：希腊政府报纸雅典的“民族日报”七月二十八日发表评论说，希腊不会参与美英法三国可能发起的对付埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的任何报复行动。这家报纸还指责西方国家对埃及和其他阿拉伯国家使用“压力”的政策是错误的。
