    Seize the Time to Prepare for the Autumn Harvest
    Learn from Lessons, Prepare in Advance
    This newspaper reports that the autumn crops in Xiangshui Temple Township, Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province are about to ripen. The CCP Xiangshui Temple Township Branch learned a lesson from last year when the Qunying Agricultural Cooperative in the township suffered heavy losses because much of the rice was ruined by rain due to insufficient preparation. Starting in early August, they began to prepare for the autumn harvest by combining the clearing of labor work points, year-end income and expenditure accounts, and actively developing sideline production.
    With this arrangement, the cooperative members are in high spirits and determined to concentrate their efforts on the autumn harvest. The township's cooperatives have organized more than 200 rice cutting and threshing teams, and 14 carpenters have repaired more than 200 pieces of old threshing machines and mats. In addition, a number of new farm tools have been added.
    The Xiangshui Temple Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also changed its past cold attitude towards supplying farm tools. In early August, it held a production and sales business meeting, went deep into the agricultural cooperatives, conducted key investigations, and prepared a large number of autumn harvest farm tools according to needs.
    Timely Issuance of Agricultural Loans, Early Repair of Autumn Harvest Farm Tools
    This newspaper reports that the full-scale harvesting of single-season rice in the Zunyi Special Zone of Guizhou Province is only forty to fifty days away. According to the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest, the relevant departments in the area have made preparations for the autumn harvest in advance. The Zunyi Central Branch of the Agricultural Bank has allocated more than 1.16 million yuan in agricultural loans to help farmers purchase autumn harvest tools and overcome livelihood difficulties. As of August 13, according to incomplete statistics, six counties, namely Chishui, Meitan, Wuchuan, Renhuai, Tongzi, and Xishui, have conducted specific research on this year's autumn harvest preparations. All counties have attached importance to the labor arrangements of agricultural production cooperatives and the preparation of autumn harvest tools. The Rural Work Department of the CCP Meitan County Committee requires its subordinate areas to earnestly help agricultural production cooperatives make labor use plans, organize professional groups for threshing, drying, and plowing, so as to achieve simultaneous harvesting, distribution, plowing and planting. Many areas have now distributed agricultural loans to agricultural production cooperatives. Many supply and marketing cooperatives have prepared to supply autumn harvest tools.
    Furthermore, the Dingzhao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province is currently adding autumn harvest farm tools. The cooperative originally planned to purchase 26 new threshing plows, 13 large scales, and 24 drying mats, repair 39 threshing plows, and 166 weaved mats. With small farm tools such as baskets, dustpans, and sickles, the total cost was estimated at 1,070 yuan. Later, the cooperative management committee believed that this expenditure was too large and decided to organize members to manufacture and repair them. According to the members' skills, three groups of carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, and iron workers were established according to actual needs, and they contracted to make and repair autumn harvest farm tools respectively. The carpentry group is responsible for making and repairing threshing plows and changing the old scales to market scales; the bamboo craftsmen group is responsible for weaving large baskets and grass baskets; the iron workers group is responsible for making scale hooks and threshing plow nails. The members who participate in the above work are given a certain amount of remuneration by the cooperative. In addition, 150 soil drying grounds are being prepared to replace drying mats; 150 yellow bamboo mats are being purchased to replace weaved mats; and small farm tools such as brooms will be resolved by the team members themselves.
    In this way, the entire cooperative only needs to purchase 150 yellow bamboo mats, 12 pieces of wrought iron, and some threshing plow nails, which only costs 175 yuan in total, a reduction of 895 yuan compared to the original plan.
    Ensure That No Harvested Grain Is Lost
    This newspaper reports that summer hoeing has ended in the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yaojiabuzi Township, Zhuozi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and it is now seizing the time to manage the fields in the later stage and actively prepare for the autumn harvest.
    Various autumn crops have entered the late stage of growth. The fruits of a year of hard work are about to be harvested. In order to increase income, the members are seizing the time to continue weeding and cultivating the soil during the gaps in the hoeing work. Some members are respectively carrying out work such as suppressing green manure, repairing sheds and building pens, hitting grass *kulun* (building walls around the place where grass is stored to prevent livestock from trampling), leveling the field, and digging yam cellars. In order to improve the condition of livestock and ensure the successful completion of the autumn harvest and autumn plowing tasks, all 200 large and small livestock in the cooperative have been withdrawn from Huitengliang. The large groups have been divided into small groups for grazing with people day and night. The farm tools required for harvesting, such as sickles, forks, rakes, and brooms, have been uniformly reserved by the agricultural cooperative from the supply and marketing cooperative. As soon as the crops turn yellow, some will cut, some will bundle, some will pull, and some will thresh, ensuring that no grain is lost.

    抓紧时机准备秋收
    记取教训提前准备
    本报讯　陕西省南郑县湘水寺乡的秋田作物即将成熟。中共湘水寺乡支部汲取去年这个乡的群英农业社由于准备工作不够，社内大部水稻被雨淋坏的教训，从8月初旬起就着手结合清理劳动工分、全年收支等账目和积极开展副业生产，进行秋收准备。
    经过这样安排，各社社员的情绪很高，决心集中力量做好秋收工作。全乡各社已组织好二百多个割谷、打谷组，十四个木匠等已把二百多件破旧的拌桶、挡席等秋收农具进行修理。另外还新添置了不少新农具。
    湘水寺供销合作社也改变了过去对供应农具冷淡的作法，在8月上旬召开了产销业务会议，深入农业社，作了重点调查，已根据需要准备好大批秋收农具。
    及时发下农业贷款  赶早修好秋收农具
    本报讯　贵州遵义专区各地的单季水稻的全面收割只有四、五十天的时间了。这个区各有关部门根据今年秋收特点，提前进行了秋收准备工作。农业银行遵义中心支行根据当前秋收准备的需要，已下拨农贷款一百一十六万多元，帮助农民添置秋收工具和克服生活困难。到8月13日止，据不完全的统计，已有赤水、湄潭、婺川、仁怀、桐梓、鰼水六个县对今年的秋收准备工作作了具体研究。各县都重视了农业生产合作社的劳力安排和秋收工具的准备。中共湄潭县委农村工作部要求所属各地，切实帮助农业生产合作社做好劳力使用计划，分别组织打谷、晒谷、犁田等专业小组，做到边收边分和边耕边种。现在许多地区已把农贷款发到了各农业生产合作社。不少供销社都进行了供应秋收工具的准备。
    又讯　贵州开阳县顶兆农业生产合作社最近正在添置秋收农具，社里原计划新置挞斗二十六张、大秤十三把、晒席二十四床，修补挞斗三十九张、围席一百六十六床，加上箩篼、撮箕、镰刀等小农具，共要花人民币一千零七十元。后来，社管会认为这个开支数字太大，决定组织社员来制造和修补，根据社员们的手艺特长，按照实际需要成立了木工、篾工、铁工三个小组，分别承包新制和补修秋收农具。木工小组负责新制、修补挞斗，把原有的老秤改为市秤；篾工小组负责编大箩篼、草篮；铁工小组负责打秤钩、挞斗钉子等。参加以上活路的社员，由社里给予一定报酬。另外，整理土晒坝一百五十个，代替晒席；买一百五十床黄篾席代替围席；至于扫帚等小农具，统一由各队队员自己解决。
    这样，全社只需购买一百五十床黄篾席，十二个毛铁和部分挞斗钉子，而这几项共只需一百七十五元，比原计划的开支缩减了八百九十五元。
    保证不让到手的粮食受损失
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区卓资县姚家卜子乡五星农业社夏锄已经结束，现正抓紧田间后期管理和积极准备收秋。
    各种大秋作物已进入生长后期，一年辛勤劳动的果实眼看就要到手了，社员们为了增加收入，都抓紧挂锄空隙，继续拔草、培土。有些社员分别进行压绿肥、修棚搭圈、打草圐?（把存草的地方打起围墙，防止牲畜糟踏）、平垫场面、挖山药窖等工作。为抓好畜膘，保证胜利完成秋收秋翻任务，全社二百多头大小牲畜，已从灰腾梁抽回来，大群分成小群，日夜跟人放牧。收割所需要的镰刀、杈、朳、扫帚等农具，已由农业社向供销社统一预定，等庄稼一黄，割的割，捆的捆，拉的拉，打的打，保证不叫粮食受到损失。
