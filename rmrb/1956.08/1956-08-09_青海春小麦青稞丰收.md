Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 8th. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province are harvesting spring wheat in the river valley areas. Reports of good harvests are constantly coming from the fields on both sides of the Yellow and Huangshui Rivers. The wheat sown by the Salar farmers on the south bank of the Yellow River has an average yield of 500 jin per mu, an increase of 25% over last year. The yield of highland barley along the Huangshui River in Ledu County was about 400 jin per mu last year, but this year it reached 620 jin.

After the completion of agricultural cooperativization in Qinghai's rural areas this year, the irrigated area has been expanded, improved varieties suitable for different areas have been promoted, field management has been improved, and rainfall has been relatively even. Therefore, crops in both the river valley areas and the dry mountainous areas are growing very well, beginning to change the historical situation where irrigated and dry land could not both have bumper harvests at the same time. According to the estimate of the Rural Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, adding the output of late autumn crops replanted in some areas, the plan to increase grain production by 23% this year compared with last year will be overfulfilled.

    青海春小麦青稞丰收
    新华社西宁8日电　青海省农业区的各族农民正在收割川水地区的春小麦。丰收喜报不断从黄河和湟水两岸的田野上传来。黄河南岸撒拉族农民播种的小麦，每亩产量平均五百斤，比去年增产两成半。乐都县湟水沿岸的青稞去年每亩收四百斤左右，今年达到六百二十斤。
    今年青海农村完成合作化以后，灌溉面积有了扩大，推广了适宜于不同地区的良种，改进了田间管理工作，雨水也比较调匀，所以川水地区和山旱地区的庄稼都长得很好，开始改变了水地和旱地不能同时丰产的历史情况。据中共青海省委员会农村工作部估计，加上部分地区复种晚秋作物的产量，今年比去年增产粮食23％的计划将要超额完成。
