Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 20th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a public gathering in Bhuj, Kutch, western India, on August 19th, that India sincerely hopes that the Suez Canal issue can be resolved amicably and will not lead to a global war.

Nehru emphasized that the Suez Canal issue cannot be resolved by merely issuing statements of friendship or empty talk, but only through cooperation among all countries. A solution to the Suez Canal issue must be sought through cooperation among all countries, in order to avoid a "global war" in the world.

Nehru said that India is friendly to Egypt, Britain, and France, which makes India's task at the twenty-two-nation Suez Canal conference "more difficult."

Nehru said that India is concerned about the Suez Canal because its imports and exports pass through this waterway. If difficulties arise in the free passage of goods through the canal, then urgently needed machinery and equipment cannot be transported to India. This situation will greatly hinder the work being carried out under the Second Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 20th: Citizens of Delhi held a mass rally on the evening of August 19th for "Suez Day." The resolution passed at the meeting demanded that any solution to the current crisis should be based on recognizing Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, and on international agreements reached through consultations between Egypt and all relevant countries regarding the use of this Egyptian waterway by ships of all nations.

The conference was held at the Delhi Municipal Hall under the auspices of the All-India Peace Council. Nearly one thousand people from all walks of life participated in the conference, including members of the Delhi Municipal Committee and members of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly.

The Egyptian ambassador and diplomatic envoys from Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia also attended the conference.

The conference sent a telegram to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, expressing admiration for the heroic and just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard their national sovereignty when their national sovereignty was threatened by the force of certain countries. The conference also telegraphed Krishna Menon, the head of the Indian delegation to the London Conference, assuring him of heartfelt support for the Indian government's efforts to curb military threats and belligerent postures that endanger world peace.

Speaking at the conference, Sundarlal, vice chairman of the All-India Peace Council, condemned the US proposal to forcibly impose international control over the Suez Canal. He said that this proposal is not only completely untenable but also threatens international peace. He pointed out that the whole of Asia and Africa are united in supporting Egypt, and if the imperialist countries dare to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, they will find that they are not only opposing the Egyptian people but also the entire people of Asia and Africa, including the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    尼赫鲁总理表示
    印度渴望苏彝士问题和好解决
    德里人民举行“苏彝士日”支持埃及
    新华社新德里20日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁八月十九日在印度西部喀齐邦卜契的一个公众集会上说，印度非常希望苏彝士运河问题能够得到和好解决，并且不会导致世界上发生全面的战火。
    尼赫鲁强调说，苏彝士运河问题不能靠仅仅声称友好的声明或者空谈来解决，而只有在各国合作的情况下才能找到解决办法。必须在各国合作之下去寻求苏彝士运河问题的解决办法，这样才能避免在世界上发生“全面的战火”。
    尼赫鲁说，印度对埃及、英国和法国都是友好的，这就使得印度在二十二国苏彝士运河会议上的任务“更加困难”。
    尼赫鲁说，印度关心苏彝士运河，因为它的进出口货要通过这条水道。如果产生货物在运河内的自由通行发生困难的情况，那末迫切需要的机器和装备就不能运到印度。这种情况将会大大妨碍根据第二个五年计划所进行的工作。
    新华社新德里20日电　德里市民在八月十九日晚上举行“苏彝士日”群众大会。会上通过的决议要求：任何解决目前危机的办法都应该以承认埃及对苏彝士运河的主权，以及埃及和一切有关国家通过协商就各国船只使用这条埃及水道问题所达成的国际协议为基础。
    大会是在全印和平理事会主持下在德里市政厅举行的。参加大会的有各界人士将近一千人，其中包括德里市政委员会委员和德里邦立法议会议员。
    埃及大使以及伊拉克、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯的外交使节也参加了大会。
    大会发出电报给埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔，对埃及人民为了在他们的国家主权受到某些国家的武力威胁的时候维护国家主权而进行的英勇和正义的斗争表示钦佩。大会还打电报给参加伦敦会议的印度代表团团长克里希纳·梅农，保证衷心支持印度政府关于制止危及世界和平的军事威胁和好战的姿态的努力。
    主持大会的全印和平理事会副主席森德拉尔在讲话的时候谴责美国所提出的硬要对苏彝士运河实行国际管制的建议。他说，这种建议不但是完全站不住的，而且还威胁国际和平。他指出，整个亚洲和非洲都团结一致支持埃及，如果帝国主义国家敢于干涉埃及内政，那末，它们就会发现他们不仅是在同埃及人民作对，而且是同包括中国人民和苏联人民在内的亚非两洲全体人民作对。
