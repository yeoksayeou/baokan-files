Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 16th. A geophysical exploration team engaged in oil exploration has recently arrived at the edge of the Ordos Basin in northeastern Gansu Province. This geophysical exploration team is jointly composed of many experts from the People's Republic of Hungary who have been sent to China to assist in geophysical exploration and Chinese geophysical exploration personnel. The protocol signed by the Sino-Hungarian Joint Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation in February this year mentioned that the People's Republic of Hungary would provide China with scientific and technological assistance in geophysical exploration.

This exploration team is equipped with the latest magnetotelluric instruments, torsion balances, and seismographs, which can detect the secrets of oil reserves deep in the strata of several thousand meters. They plan to use this most advanced method to explore oil reserves within an area of 16,000 square kilometers within two years. The "mobile homes" carried by this geophysical exploration team have already been set up at the work site. Soon, they will fully launch oil exploration work.

The Ordos Basin includes parts of Gansu, Shaanxi, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with a total area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers. Currently, in addition to this geophysical exploration team, there are several other petroleum geological teams and oil drilling teams in the marginal areas of this platform. According to preliminary exploration in the past, this is a promising oil-bearing area.

    一支地球物理勘探队
    到达鄂尔多斯地台勘探石油
    新华社兰州16日电　一支进行石油勘探工作的地球物理勘探队，最近到达了甘肃省东北鄂尔多斯地台的边沿地区。这支地球物理勘探队，是由匈牙利人民共和国派遣来我国帮助进行地球物理勘探的许多专家和我国地球物理勘探人员联合组成的。今年二月间，中、匈科学和技术合作联合委员会签订的议定书上，曾经提到匈牙利人民共和国在地球物理勘探方面给中国以科学技术援助。
    这支勘探队带有最新式的大地电流仪、扭称仪和地震仪等，这些仪器能够窥测出几千公尺的地层深处蕴藏石油的秘密。他们计划在两年以内，用这种最先进的方法勘探出一万六千平方公里范围内的石油蕴藏情况。现在，这个地球物理勘探队携带的“活动房屋”，已经在工作地点安扎了起来。不久，他们就要全面展开石油勘探工作。
    鄂尔多斯地台包括甘肃、陕西和内蒙古自治区的各一部分，总面积约有三十万平方公里。目前在这个地台的边沿地区，除了这个地球物理勘探队以外，还有其他几个石油地质队和石油钻井队。据过去初步勘探了解，这里是一个有希望的含油区。
