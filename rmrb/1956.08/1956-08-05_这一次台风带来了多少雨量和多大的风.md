How Much Rain and Wind Did This Typhoon Bring?
Central Meteorological Science Research Institute
The powerful typhoon that landed in Zhejiang on August 2nd weakened rapidly by 8:00 AM on August 4th, about 20-30 kilometers north of Zhengzhou. Now the maximum wind force at the center is only level 4 or 5, and its nature has quickly changed to a general "low pressure," moving very slowly. However, this low pressure is still bringing heavy rain to northern Henan, southern Shanxi, and southern Hebei. For example, in the six hours from 2:00 AM to 8:00 AM on the 4th, Zhengzhou received 33 mm of rainfall, Xinxiang 22 mm, Yuncheng 34 mm, and Shijiazhuang 16 mm. It is estimated that this heavy rain in the area will disappear in the next day or two as the "low pressure" dissipates.

This powerful typhoon, like those in previous years, originated in the Pacific Ocean south of Japan. On July 28th, the center of this strong typhoon was located at 20 degrees north latitude and 140 degrees east longitude, moving in a northwest-west direction at a speed of 450-500 kilometers per day. The maximum wind force near its center reached above level 12. In the ocean, its level 6 gale circle reached 800-1000 kilometers from the typhoon center. By the afternoon of July 30th, it began to affect the East China Sea. On the morning of the 1st, level 6 gales began to affect the coastal areas of the Taiwan Strait and south of the Yangtze River and north of Fuzhou. Starting at 2:00 PM on the 1st, level 6 and 7 gales became common in southern Jiangsu, and level 5 and 6 gales also occurred in the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi. On the morning of the 2nd, this typhoon landed near Xiangshan Port in Zhejiang. The landing point had level 12 or higher gales and very strong rainstorms. At 8:00 AM, it passed through Hangzhou, at 2:00 PM it reached the vicinity of Wuhu, and at 8:00 PM it reached Chaohu. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, it reached the vicinity of Fuyang. At this time, the central wind force had weakened to only level 7 or 8. After that, it moved in a northwest direction at a slow speed, and the central wind speed decreased rapidly. By 8:00 PM on the 3rd, it reached 50 kilometers south of Kaifeng. At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, it reached 20-30 kilometers north of Zhengzhou. The central wind force was already very small.

There were widespread rainstorms on the path of the typhoon, but there were also strong winds or heavy rain in locations far from the typhoon. The maximum wind forces in various locations are as follows:

	Shanghai 34 meters per second (level 12)
	Zhoushan 40 meters per second (level 12)
	Haimen 34 meters per second (level 12)
	Haizhou 35 meters per second (level 12)
	Anqing 40 meters per second (level 12)
	Qingdao 32 meters per second (level 11)
	Nanjing 26 meters per second (level 10)
	Suzhou 24 meters per second (level 9)
	Changde 24 meters per second (level 9)
	Yueyang 22 meters per second (level 9)
	Jiujiang 24 meters per second (level 9)
	Heze 28 meters per second (level 10)
	Hankou 17 meters per second (level 7)
	Zhengzhou 28 meters per second (level 10)
	Xingtai 20 meters per second (level 8)
	Tanggu 23 meters per second (level 9)

From this, it can be seen that the strong winds caused by this typhoon were greatest in northern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, generally ranging from level 10 to level 12. The wind force in the northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong coastal areas was also level 8-11. Other areas such as Anhui, northern Jiangxi, Dongting Lake, eastern Hubei, eastern Henan, coastal and southern Hebei, and Shandong Province generally had level 6-8 gales, with some individual areas reaching level 12. The areas with the most rainfall were those through which the typhoon passed, such as Haimen with 141 mm, Tianmu Mountain with 248 mm, Huangshan with 318 mm, Wuhu with 129 mm, Bengbu with 105 mm, Fuyang with 99 mm, Kaifeng with 118 mm, and Zhengzhou with 173 mm. At the same time, affected by the typhoon, heavy rain was also caused in the mountainous areas of northeastern Hebei and Henan. For example, by 8:00 AM on the 4th, the rainfall in Beijing was 127 mm, Baoding 144 mm, Handan 153 mm, Anyang 144 mm, and Shijiazhuang 187 mm. The precipitation in these areas is equivalent to the average total monthly precipitation in August.

The strong winds and rainstorms caused by this typhoon affected ten provinces (northern Fujian, northern Jiangxi, northern Hunan, eastern Hubei, eastern and northern Henan, all of Anhui, all of Jiangsu, all of Zhejiang, Shandong, and Hebei), with Zhejiang Province being the most severely affected. Such a powerful typhoon is the largest since liberation and is also rare in the last fifty years. For example, the strongest typhoon that passed through Shanghai in late July 1915 had a maximum wind force of only 38 meters per second (level 12) and rainfall of 102 mm. The strongest typhoon that passed through Shanghai in late July 1949 had a maximum wind force of only 36 meters per second (level 12) and rainfall of 135 mm. The locations through which this typhoon center passed generally had level 12 or higher winds (around 40 meters per second) and rainfall of over 100 mm, with the largest rainfall exceeding 300 mm.

    这一次台风带来了多少雨量和多大的风
    中央气象科学研究所
    八月二日从浙江登陆的强大台风中心，到四日上午八时，在郑州北面二、三十公里处，减弱很快。现在中心最大风力已只有四、五级了，性质也已迅速改变为一般的“低气压”，移动很慢。但是这个低气压，目前还给河南北部、山西南部、河北南部带来很大的雨。例如在四日上午二时到八时，六个小时内的雨量，郑州下了三十三公厘、新乡二十二公厘、运城三十四公厘、石家庄十六公厘。估计这一带的大雨，在最近一、两天里，就可因“低气压”的消失而消失。
    这一次强大台风也和往年一样，发生在日本南部太平洋的洋面上。七月二十八日，这个强台风中心位置在北纬二十度东经一百四十度，每天以四百五十——五百公里的速度向西北偏西方向移动。它的中心附近最大风力到了十二级以上。在海洋上，它的六级大风圈，到达离台风中心八百——一千公里处。到了七月三十日下午，开始影响我国东海。一日早晨，六级大风开始影响到台湾海峡和长江以南福州以北的沿海地带。一日十四时开始，江苏南部普遍有了六、七级大风，江西鄱阳湖一带也起了五、六级大风。到二日早晨，这个台风在浙江象山港附近登陆。登陆地点有十二级以上大风，和很强的暴雨。八时，经过杭州，十四时，到达芜湖附近，二十时到巢湖。三日早晨二时到达阜阳附近。这时，中心风力已经减弱，只有七、八级了。以后向西北方向移动，速度很慢，中心风速很快减小。到三日二十时到达开封以南五十公里处。四日早晨八时，到了郑州以北二、三十公里处。中心风力已很小了。
    在台风经过的路径上，普遍有暴风雨，但是距离台风很远的地点，也有大风或大雨。各地的最大风力如下：
    上海每秒三十四公尺（十二级）
    舟山每秒四十公尺（十二级）
    海门每秒三十四公尺（十二级）
    海州每秒三十五公尺（十二级）
    安庆每秒四十公尺（十二级）
    青岛每秒三十二公尺（十一
  级）
    南京每秒二十六公尺（十级）
    苏州每秒二十四公尺（九级）
    常德每秒二十四公尺（九级）
    岳阳每秒二十二公尺（九级）
    九江每秒二十四公尺（九级）
    菏泽每秒二十八公尺（十级）
    汉口每秒十七公尺（七级）
    郑州每秒二十八公尺（十级）
    邢台每秒二十公尺（八级）
    塘沽每秒二十三公尺（九级）。
    由此看来，这次因台风造成的大风，以浙江北部和江苏南部最大，普遍在十级到十二级不等。江苏北部和山东南部沿海风力也有八——十一级。其他如安徽、江西北部、洞庭湖、湖北东部、河南东部、河北沿海和南部、山东全省，普遍有六——八级的大风，个别地区也到了十二级。而雨量最大的地方是台风经过的地方，例如海门有141公厘，天目山248公厘，黄山318公厘，芜湖129公厘，蚌埠105公厘，阜阳99公厘，开封118公厘，郑州173公厘。同时，受台风影响，在河北省和河南省的东北部沿山地区也造成大雨。例如到四日八时止，雨量在北京下了127公厘、保定144公厘、邯郸153公厘、安阳144公厘、石家庄187公厘。这些地区的降水量，相当于八月份平均月总降水量。
    这次因台风所造成的大风和暴雨，波及十个省（福建北部、江西北部、湖南北部、湖北东部、河南东部和北部、安徽全省、江苏全省、浙江全省、山东和河北），其中以浙江省受害最大。这样强大的台风，是解放以来最大的一次，也是五十年来所罕见的。例如1915年7月下旬，经过上海的一次强台风，风力最大也不过是每秒三十八公尺（十二级），雨量102公厘。1949年7月下旬，经过上海的一次强台风，风力最大也不过是每秒三十六公尺（十二级），雨量135公厘。而这一次台风中心经过的地点普遍在十二级以上（每秒四十公尺左右），雨量在100公厘以上，最大的雨量超过300公厘。
