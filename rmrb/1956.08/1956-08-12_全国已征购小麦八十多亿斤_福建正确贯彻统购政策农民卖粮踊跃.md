    Nationally, Over Eight Billion Jin of Wheat Has Been Purchased
    Fujian Correctly Implements Unified Purchase Policy, Farmers Sell Grain Enthusiastically
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th: After the wheat harvest, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are enthusiastically paying summer grain taxes and selling wheat.
    According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, by the end of July, the nation had purchased over eight billion jin of wheat. Among them, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces have all exceeded their purchase plans. Farmers in the areas along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province sold more summer grain to the state than in the same period last year. The summer grain purchase work in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Hubei provinces has completed 60% to 80% of the purchase plan.
    Due to excessive rainfall this year, the quality of wheat in some areas is not high, and some wheat has sprouted or become moldy. However, due to the timely organization of the masses by local Party and government leading organs and grain departments to carry out wheat drying work, and the universal implementation of quality determination, quantity determination, time determination, and location determination, the mildew and loss of waterlogged wheat have been greatly reduced.
    Currently, early rice in the southern provinces has been successively entering the market, and the purchase volume of early rice in some areas is growing rapidly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th (by Xinhua News Agency reporter Gong Renzuo): Fujian Province's grain departments purchased 140 million jin of early rice in July, an increase of 124.3% over the same period last year.
    Fujian Province has had a bumper harvest of early rice this year, with an estimated total output of 2.2 billion jin, an increase of 600 million jin over last year.
    In purchasing surplus grain, grain departments in various regions resolutely implemented the policy of fixed production and fixed purchase for three years unchanged, starting in 1955, with no increase in purchase for increased production. Some cadres in grain departments in the Longxi area, seeing that farmers had harvested more grain, once engaged in the phenomenon of increasing purchase tasks at each level and mobilizing farmers to sell more grain. This phenomenon was quickly corrected after being pointed out by higher authorities.
    The Fujian Provincial People's Committee recently considered that the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway track-laying project is progressing steadily, and the grain freight rates in areas along the railway have been or will be greatly reduced. Therefore, it decided to generally increase the unified purchase price of rice in twelve counties along the line, including Guangze, Sha County, and Zhangping. In this way, the farmers in the twelve counties can increase their annual income by more than 500,000 yuan.
    Farmers in various regions are very enthusiastic about selling unified purchase grain. Many agricultural production cooperatives completed their grain sales tasks one or two days after receiving the summer grain unified purchase task books. The quality of the grain already purchased in various regions generally meets national purchase standards.

    全国已征购小麦八十多亿斤
    福建正确贯彻统购政策农民卖粮踊跃
    新华社9日讯　麦收后，各地农业社交纳夏季公粮和出卖小麦都很踊跃。
    据粮食部统计，到七月底全国征购小麦已达八十多亿斤。其中福建、浙江、江西、贵州、湖南五省都超额完成了征购计划。安徽省沿江地区的农民卖给国家的夏粮比去年同期增加。山东、河南、河北、湖北等省的夏粮征购工作，已完成征购计划的60％到80％。
    因今年雨水多，部分地区的小麦质量不高，有些地区的小麦有发芽、霉坏现象。但由于各地党政领导机关和粮食部门及时组织群众进行了小麦整晒工作，并且普遍执行了定质、定量、定时、定点等工作，大大减轻了受涝小麦的霉坏和损耗。
    目前，南方各省早稻已陆续上市，有些地区的早稻收购量增长很快。
    新华社福州9日电　新华社记者龚人左报道：福建省粮食部门在七月份内收购早稻谷达一亿四千万斤，比去年同期增加124.3％。
    今年福建省早稻丰收，估计总产量达二十二亿斤，比去年增产六亿斤。
    各地粮食部门在收购余粮中，坚决贯彻了从1955年起定产、定购三年不变的增产不增购的政策。龙溪地区有些粮食部门的干部看到农民粮食收的多了，曾一度发生过层层加派征购任务，发动农民多卖粮的现象。这一现象经上级指出，很快就纠正了。
    福建省人民委员会最近考虑到鹰潭—厦门铁路铺轨工程正节节前进，铁路沿线地区的粮食运价已经或即将大大降低，因此决定将沿线的光泽、沙县、漳平等十二个县的稻谷统购价格，予以普遍提高。这样，可以使十二个县的农民全年增加五十多万元收入。
    各地农民出售统购粮的热情都很高，很多农业生产合作社接到夏粮统购任务书后的一天或两天，就完成了售粮任务。各地已收购的粮食的质量，一般都符合国家收购标准。
