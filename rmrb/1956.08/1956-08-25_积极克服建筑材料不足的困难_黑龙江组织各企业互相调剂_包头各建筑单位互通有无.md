Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd: Solving the difficulties of insufficient building materials through methods such as exchanging goods, mutually disclosing information, mutually adjusting, and balanced distribution has proven to be an effective method at the recent Heilongjiang Province state-owned and local state-owned enterprise building materials balance meeting.

This meeting allocated nearly 70,000 cubic meters of timber from the province's stockpiled timber for sale, meeting the needs of more than 95% of the units in the province that urgently needed timber. The timber needs of many key projects such as the Shuangyashan Coal Preparation Plant, the Northeast Third Engineering Company, and the Harbin Electric Brush Factory have all been resolved. The Jixi Mining Bureau was unable to complete more than 10,000 square meters of new family dormitories due to a shortage of timber, which was also fully resolved this time. The Northeast Third Engineering Company and other units voluntarily handed over more than 1,500 tons of their surplus cement for distribution at the meeting, meeting the urgent needs of seventeen units for cement. Forty-eight units in urgent need of steel also received varying degrees of satisfaction. An important factory building contracted by an engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering was previously suspended due to a shortage of 30 tons of 25 mm thick steel plates, while the company had stockpiled seamless steel pipes. Coincidentally, the Northeast Third Engineering Company's contracted project had the same specification of steel plates that were temporarily not needed, but urgently needed 20 tons of seamless steel pipes. The two parties exchanged materials at the meeting, and the problems were all resolved.

This meeting was convened by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee from the 9th to the 15th. Before the meeting, the Provincial People's Committee sent three working groups to investigate and grasp resource conditions. The meeting implemented the balance principles of combining regional balance and system balance, prioritizing key projects while taking care of general projects, and taking care of projects that could not be completed or started due to a lack of materials.

This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, basic construction units in Baotou City have actively adjusted building materials, basically overcoming the phenomenon of work stoppages due to lack of materials.

This year, the North China Baotou Engineering General Company has successively lent the Baotou First Engineering Office of the Beijing Infrastructure Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry 15 tons of angle steel and 146 tons of rebar. In June, when this engineering office was doing concrete work, the North China Baotou Engineering General Company lent them another 155 tons of volcanic ash. In addition, the North China Baotou Engineering General Company also lent some steel and cement to construction units such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Water Supply and Drainage Engineering Company, the Baotou Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau, and the Hohhot Industrial School Project. The projects of units such as the Baotou Hotel, General Hospital, and Department Store also borrowed a lot of steel, cement, and pipes from the North China Baotou Engineering General Company, basically ensuring the progress of construction.

The North China Baotou Engineering General Company has also received care from fraternal units. The Anshan Construction Baotou Branch lent them 200 tons of refractory bricks. The Water Supply and Drainage Engineering Company plans to lend them more than 7,000 meters of cast iron pipes of different diameters. The Baotou First Engineering Office of the Beijing Infrastructure Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry also exchanged ribbed steel bars of different diameters with the North China Baotou Engineering General Company, which provided convenience for both parties in construction.

    积极克服建筑材料不足的困难
    黑龙江组织各企业互相调剂
    包头各建筑单位互通有无
    新华社哈尔滨22日电　通过以物换物、互相交底、互相调剂、平衡分配来解决建筑材料不足的困难，在最近举行的黑龙江省国营和地方国营企业建筑材料平衡会议上被证明是一种有效的方法。
    这次会议从省内积压的木材中调拨出将近七万立方公尺木材出售，满足了省内95％以上的急需木材的单位的需要。双鸭山选煤厂、东北第三工程公司、哈尔滨电刷厂等许多重点工程需要的木材已经全部得到解决。鸡西矿务局因缺少木材影响一万多平方公尺新建家属宿舍不能竣工，这次也全部得到解决。东北第三工程公司等单位主动将他们多余的一千五百多吨水泥交出在会议上分配，满足了十七个单位对水泥的急需。四十八个急需钢材的单位也得到了程度不同的满足。建筑工程部直属工程公司承包的重要厂房，过去因缺少三十吨二十五公厘厚的钢板停工待料，同时公司却积存了无缝钢管。正好东北第三工程公司所承包的工程有同样规格的钢板暂时不用，但是又急需无缝钢管二十吨。会议上双方经过互相串换，问题都解决了。
    这次会议是中共黑龙江省委员会和黑龙江省人民委员会在九日到十五日召开的。会前，省人民委员会曾派出三个工作组下去摸底和掌握资源情况。会议中执行了地区平衡和系统平衡相结合、以重点工程为主照顾一般和照顾因缺少量物资而不能结尾或不能开工的工程等平衡原则。
    本报讯　包头市各基本建设单位，在中共包头市委领导下，积极调剂建筑材料，基本上克服了停工待料现象。
    华北包头工程总公司今年先后借给电力工业部北京基建局包头第一工程处工地角钢十五吨，钢筋一百四十六吨。在六月份，这个工程处做混凝土工程的时候，华北包头工程总公司又借给他们一百五十五吨火山灰。此外，华北包头工程总公司还借给内蒙古自治区给水排水工程公司、包头市工程管理局和呼和浩特市工业学校工程等施工单位部分钢材和水泥。包头市宾馆、综合医院、百货公司等单位的工程，从华北包头工程总公司也借出不少钢材、水泥和管材，基本上保证了施工的进行。
    华北包头工程总公司也得到了兄弟单位的关怀。鞍建包头分公司借给他们耐火砖二百吨。给水排水工程公司准备借给他们不同直径的铸铁管七千多公尺。电力工业部北京基建局包头第一工程处还同华北包头工程总公司调换了不同直径的螺纹钢，双方在施工中都得到了便利。　　　　　　　　　　（包头日报）
