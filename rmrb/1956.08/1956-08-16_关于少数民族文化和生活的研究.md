Research on Culture and Life of Ethnic Minorities
　　Fei Xiaotong, Lin Yaohua
　　China's ethnic minorities are in a period of tremendous and rapid transformation, transitioning towards socialism from different social foundations. This transformation is not only a change in the mode of production, from primitive societies or societies divided into hostile classes to societies without exploitation, but also an extremely broad and profound change in all aspects of culture and life. The people of all ethnic minorities will develop into people with highly developed cultures and modern lives during this great transitional period. The new cultures and new lives of all ethnic groups will not be created out of thin air or entirely imported from other ethnic groups, divorced from their original cultures and lives, but will inevitably be developed on the basis of their original ethnic cultures. This is a process of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, a growing process of developing the excellent traditions of one's own ethnic group on the one hand, and struggling against the old and harmful old culture and old ways of life on the other hand; it is also a process of creatively combining socialist content and national forms. The task of ethnologists is to study this process and help the people of all ethnic groups promote this process. This is the research on the culture and life of ethnic minorities. This research has three aspects:

　　1. The research of ethnologists on the culture and life of the people of all ethnic groups should first focus on observing the new things created by the people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party and the government; paying attention to how these new cultures and new lives arise, how they are accepted by the masses, and how they meet the new needs of the masses. This is the first and most important aspect of this research.

　　2. Since these new cultures and new lives are developed on the basis of original ethnic traditions and grow in the struggle against the dying old cultures and old ways of life, we must also have a full understanding of the original cultures and lives of all ethnic groups. It must be pointed out that the study of the old cultures and lives of all ethnic groups is for a better understanding of the contradictions existing in the current culture and life of all ethnic groups and for a more correct assessment of the significance of the new cultures and new lives, which is completely different from the bourgeois scholars' views of hunting for novelty and collecting antiques.

　　To correctly understand the changes in the original culture and life of the people of all ethnic groups in the socialist transformation, we must distinguish which are the national traditions that should be developed and which are the obstacles to the development of new cultures and new lives. This requirement leads us to analyze the relationship between culture, life, and the socio-economic base. In the original culture and life, some parts directly serve the exploiting classes, some parts are created by the working people to serve themselves, and some parts do not belong to the superstructure. Some of these parts with different natures should be eliminated in the socialist transformation, some can be utilized, and some must be developed. This is the second aspect of this research.

　　3. Socialist culture is developed through national forms that are loved and welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups. This is fundamentally different from bourgeois cosmopolitanism. The culture and life of a nation are the product of the long-term history of that nation and the accumulation of the wisdom of the working people of that nation. Due to different historical conditions, the working people of all ethnic groups have created the characteristics of their culture and life. Moreover, the people of all ethnic groups grow up in this life with special forms from an early age, developing their feelings for the forms of their own ethnic group, and at the same time becoming the basis for their continued development of their culture and life. In this sense, the culture and life of all ethnic groups have historical continuity. Of course, national forms are also constantly changing, but the law of this change is different from the law of social nature change. Deeply studying the national forms of culture and life of all ethnic groups and the law of its change is the third aspect of this research.

　　The socialist transformation of ethnic minorities in our country has only begun in the last few years, and ethnologists have not paid enough attention to this major historical event. However, this change is very rapid, so if we do not study this process in time, it will inevitably become an irreparable regret in the future. Therefore, we must put forward this research as an important task of ethnological research in the future.

　　Although we still lack sufficient attention and systematic research on the culture and life of ethnic minorities, we have also accumulated some scattered data in this area. From these data, we can see that the original culture and life of all ethnic groups are diverse and extremely complex. At the same time, we can also see that the people of all ethnic groups have their own unique creations, making their culture and life rich and colorful. We cannot give a comprehensive introduction to the culture and life of ethnic minorities in China here, but we are willing to put forward some preliminary opinions on the issues that should be paid attention to when conducting research in these areas.

　　1. We may as well start with material culture. Material culture includes production tools and living utensils. Production tools are the main part of the means of labor, and the improvement of production tools promotes the development of productive forces, thereby promoting the development of social economy. Therefore, people use different production tools at different stages of social development. The social development of ethnic minorities in our country is unbalanced, and the production tools they use are either very simple and primitive or relatively developed. Moreover, due to the vast territory of our country and the diverse geographical conditions, the production activities engaged in by people in various places are also different. Not only are there differences between agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, and hunting, but even if they are all engaged in agriculture, there are differences between plains and mountainous areas. Therefore, the diversity of their production tools is increased. The research on production tools should first pay attention to their level of development, and determine whether they are backward or advanced from the amount of production harvested by applying certain tools. The replacement of backward tools by advanced tools is a general phenomenon in the process of social development. Ethnologists should not only pay attention to this general phenomenon, carefully observe the speed at which new tools replace old tools, and the problems that exist, etc., but also pay attention to the fact that some old tools that have been replaced in major production activities are retained in handicraft and gardening activities, or in religious and social rituals, and even become tools for competition and entertainment.

　　In connection with production tools, we should also pay attention to the production knowledge and technology of all ethnic groups, especially the special knowledge and technology accumulated in a certain area for a long time. These are extremely valuable and are the basis for economic development. The establishment of a socialist society will give all ethnic groups full opportunities to develop their special production undertakings suitable for the local area. For example, the medicinal materials in the mountainous areas of Southwest China have extremely high economic value, and ethnic minorities have specialized knowledge and technology in collecting and cultivating these medicinal materials.

　　Living utensils should be studied in connection with all aspects of life, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, health care, and funerals. They all have national characteristics. Not to mention the art processed by the people of all ethnic groups in this regard, but only from the raw materials and forms, each has its own creations and habits. All kinds of ethnic costumes are familiar to us and have become a simple symbol for distinguishing ethnic groups. All ethnic groups also have differences in diet, and the eating habits developed from childhood are not easy to change. In the development of cities, the establishment of ethnic canteens has become a practical need. The same is true for the construction of houses and the forms of transportation. The national characteristics expressed in living utensils are of course related to the production situation of all ethnic groups. For example, nomadic ethnic groups wear leather and wool fabrics, eat meat and dairy products, live in yurts, ride horses, and pull large-wheeled carts, and ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas of Southwest China wear hemp fabrics, eat glutinous rice, live in bamboo buildings, and carry goods. These are obvious examples; however, a deeper study of all their forms, such as ethnic groups living in the same geographical conditions, some like white, some like black, and some like blue and red, these characteristics in form cannot be simply explained from the production situation. We must study them in conjunction with the history of these ethnic groups. The characteristics of all ethnic groups in living utensils will not undergo fundamental changes due to changes in social nature, and they can very well enter socialist society with many of these characteristics.

　　2. People's social life refers to customs and habits related to interpersonal relationships. The research in this area should first pay attention to the situations that are closely related to the nature of society, that is to say, no matter what ethnic group, the same situation will occur at a certain stage of development. For example, in primitive society, blood relationship is the basic link of social relations, and there are often many cumbersome ritual activities around the life programs that determine kinship. These are common characteristics of a certain stage of social development. However, the common characteristics of a certain stage of social development can also be retained in varying degrees in the subsequent stages in residual form, and new contents can be developed in the old forms. These situations not only confuse the analysis of social nature, but also make the research on social life more complicated.

　　In class society, the common characteristic of people's social life is class distinction. This distinction can be very large, even forming "two cultures." Therefore, when studying this society, we must first pay attention to this characteristic. In the past, some people often regarded the way of life of the ruling class of a certain ethnic group as the characteristic of this ethnic group, which was wrong.

　　When studying the social life of all classes in class society, we should also pay attention to the influence of the exploiting classes on the working people. The way of life of the exploiting classes is in a dominant position in class society, and the exploiting classes also use their power to promote various customs and habits that are beneficial to them. For example, discrimination against women, and even customs such as foot binding, are obviously detrimental to the working people, but due to the promotion and implementation of the exploiting classes, they are also popular among the working people. Therefore, the class analysis of social life is not simple.

　　Among the working people, their social life is mostly closely integrated with their production activities. For example, the nature of festivals is often the mobilization of production activities and the celebration of harvests; mass gatherings such as temple fairs and dancing parties are often combined with trade activities. These social activities certainly play a certain positive role in production, but in the process of transforming production technology, customs and habits related to backward technology can also play a negative role in hindering the transformation. The same situation should be paid attention to in many customs related to health care and funerals. Many life experiences of the working people are often fixed in customs and habits. When these customs and habits are formed, they can have a positive effect, but when living conditions change, these customs and habits become a force to maintain backward forms, which becomes an obstacle to progress. For example, although many taboos have certain hygienic value, they can also become an obstacle to the dissemination of scientific knowledge. More importantly, some customs and habits are currently very unfavorable to the development of production and even affect the development of the nation. Therefore, we must critically accept the customs and habits of the working people, and should not uniformly call them national characteristics and demand preservation and development. The investigation and research of ethnologists can help the people of all ethnic groups re-evaluate their customs and habits.

　　3. Art and literature are important parts of the culture and life of all ethnic groups. No matter what stage of social development, no ethnic group does not have its unique creation in this regard. Some people think that ethnic groups with backward production have no art and literature, which is not in line with the facts. Among the ethnic minorities in our country, some are still economically backward, but they also have valuable works of art; for example, the Gaoshan people in Taiwan are still quite primitive economically, but their carved totem versions have a high artistic level, and the shell clothes they weave have a long history and are also extremely beautiful handicrafts; the Yi people in Daliangshan use exquisite colors and patterns on their tableware and saddles, and the bamboo utensils of the Miao and Zhuang people, even the simplest fish baskets, have a high evaluation in art. The same is true for the literary works of all ethnic minorities. All ethnic groups have rich oral creations. The long poem "Ashima" of the Sani people in Yunnan has won the praise of the national literary and art circles once it was recorded and translated. As for ethnic groups with developed writing, more literary heritage is preserved. The "Story of Gesar" of the Mongolian people and the "Life of Milarepa" of the Tibetan people are examples that are already known to everyone. The situation in music and dance is the same. These arts and literature created by the working people, loved by the working people, and preserved over the generations are not only the precious heritage of all ethnic groups, but also the common wealth of our motherland's ethnic family that is worth being proud of.

　　The artistic creations of all ethnic groups provide rich research materials in many aspects of fine arts, literature, music, and dance, and these materials are equally valuable to ethnologists. On the one hand, ethnologists should use the living content reflected in these works to enrich their understanding of the social life of these ethnic groups in various periods. For example, the long poem "Ashima" vividly reflects the love of young men and women and the contradictions of the class society at that time, which gives us a close understanding of the social nature of Sani. On the other hand, ethnologists should also understand the formation and changes of their artistic styles from the historical conditions of these ethnic groups. For example, the music and dance of the Miao people in eastern Guizhou show a heavy, suppressed, introverted, and delicate style. This style may be inseparable from their long-term lack of their own regime and their history of being oppressed and dispersed. After liberation, the excited, grateful, and cheerful tones revealed in their songs praising Chairman Mao also reflect their mood of being reborn from the brink of death. For another example, Mongolian music has undergone changes in long and short tones in history, and this change suggests major changes that may have occurred in society at that time. The works of art and literature of all ethnic groups often give us evidence of cultural exchanges between ethnic groups. For example, the close relationship between the Tibetan people and the Han people in the Tang Dynasty is still reflected in their existing music and dance. The examples we have given here may be incorrect due to lack of research, but they can suggest that ethnologists have a vast field of research in this area.

　　Research on the art and literature of ethnic minorities is of great significance to the development of all ethnic groups. The ethnic minorities in our country are all in the stage of forming socialist nations. Art and literature play an important role in developing the common psychological characteristics of socialist nations, and at the same time, the formation of socialist nations has created the best conditions for the people of all ethnic groups to develop national art and literature. It can be foreseen that great works will inevitably appear during the period when they form socialist nations.

    关于少数民族文化和生活的研究
    费孝通　林耀华
　　我国的少数民族正处在巨大和迅速变革的时期，从不同社会性质的基础出发向社会主义过渡。这个变革不仅是生产方式的改变，从原始的或是分裂成敌对阶级的社会改变成没有剥削的社会，而且是极广泛和深刻的文化和生活各方面的改变。各少数民族的人民都将在这个伟大的过渡时期发展成具有高度文化和现代生活的人。各民族的新文化和新生活并不是离开了他们原有的文化和生活，凭空创造或全部向别民族输入的，而必然是从原有民族文化的基础上发展起来的。这是一个推陈出新的过程，是一个一方面发展本民族的优良传统，一方面和陈旧的和有害的旧文化、旧生活进行斗争的生长过程；也是一个社会主义内容和民族形式创造性的结合的过程。民族学者的任务就是研究这个过程和帮助各民族人民促进这个过程。这就是关于少数民族文化和生活的研究。这项研究有三个方面：
　　⒈民族学者对各民族人民的文化和生活的研究首先应当着重观察各民族人民在党和政府领导下所创造的新事物；注意这些新文化和新生活是怎样发生的，怎样为群众所接受的，怎样满足群众的新需要。这是这项研究的第一个，也是最重要的方面。
　　⒉这些新文化和新生活既然是在原有民族传统的基础上发展起来，和与衰亡的旧的文化、旧生活斗争中长成的，我们也必须对各民族原有的文化、生活有充分的认识。必须指出，对于各族旧有文化和生活的研究是为了更好的理解各族人民当前文化和生活中存在的矛盾和更正确地估计新文化和新生活的意义，这和资产阶级学者的猎奇和搜集古董的观点毫无相同之处。
　　要正确地了解各民族人民原有的文化和生活在社会主义改造中的变化，我们必须区别那些是应当发展的民族传统，那些是发展新文化、新生活的障碍。这个要求就引导我们去分析文化、生活和社会经济基础的关系。在原有的文化和生活中，有些部分是直接服务于剥削阶级的，有些部分是劳动人民创造出来服务于自己的，也有些部分是不属于社会上层建筑的。这些不同性质的部分在社会主义改造中有些是应该消灭的，有些是可以利用的，有些是必须发展的。这是这项研究的第二个方面。
　　⒊社会主义的文化是通过各民族人民所喜闻乐见的民族形式来发展的。这是和资产阶级的世界主义根本不同之处。一个民族的文化和生活是这个民族长期历史的产物，是这个民族劳动人民智慧的积累，由于历史条件不同，各民族劳动人民创造了他们文化和生活上的特点。而且各民族的人民从小在这种具有特殊形式的生活中成长，养成了他们对自己民族形式的感情，同时也成了他们继续发展他们的文化和生活的基础。在这个意义上，各民族的文化和生活具有历史的继承性。当然民族形式也是不断变化的，但是这种变化的规律却不同于社会性质变化的规律。深刻地研究各民族文化和生活所具有的民族形式和它变化的规律，是这项研究的第三个方面。
　　我国少数民族的社会主义改造是这几年才开始的，民族学者对这个重大历史事件的注意还很不够。但是这个变化是很迅速的，所以如果不及时研究这个过程，将来必然会成为一个不可弥补的遗憾。因此我们必须在这个时候把这项研究提出来作为今后民族学研究的一项重要任务。
　　我们对于各少数民族的文化和生活虽则还缺乏足够的注意和系统的研究，但是在这方面我们也累积了一些零星的资料。从这些资料中我们可以看到各民族原有的文化和生活是多种多样的，极为复杂的。同时，也可以看到各民族人民都有他们独到的创造，使他们的文化和生活丰富多采。我们在这里不能对国内少数民族文化和生活作综合的介绍，但是愿意对进行这些方面的研究时应当注意的问题提出一些初步意见。
　　⒈我们不妨先从物质文化说起。物质文化包括生产工具和生活用具。生产工具是劳动资料的主要部分，生产工具的改进，促进生产力的发展，从而促进社会经济的发展。所以人们不同社会发展阶段使用不同的生产工具。我国各少数民族社会发展不平衡，他们所用的生产工具有的是很简单和原始的，也有比较发达的。又由于我国幅员广大，地理条件多种多样，各地方人民所从事的生产也有不同，不但有农牧渔猎之别，即是都从事农业，还有平原和山区的差异。因此增加了他们所用生产工具的多样性。对于生产工具的研究首先应当注意它们的发展水平，从应用一定工具所收获的生产量来决定它是落后的还是先进的。落后的工具被先进的工具所代替是社会发展过程中的一般现象。民族学者不仅要注意这一般的现象，细致地观察新工具代替旧工具的速度，和存在的问题等等，而且还要注意有些在主要生产活动中被代替了的旧工具却保留在工艺和园艺的活动里，或是在宗教和社会的仪式里，甚至成为竞技和游艺的用具。
　　联系着生产工具，我们还应当注意各民族的生产知识和技术，特别是长期在一定地域里所积累的特殊知识和技术。这些都是极可宝贵的，而且是经济发展的基础，社会主义社会的建立将给各民族发展他们特别适宜于当地的生产事业以充分的机会。比如西南山区的药材具有极高的经济价值，而少数民族在搜集和培养这些药材上却具有专门的知识和技术。
　　生活用具是应当联系着衣、食、住、行、养生送死等各方面生活内容来研究的。它们都具有民族的特点，且不提在这方面各民族人民所加工的艺术，只从原料和形式上来说也各有各的创造和习惯。各式各样的民族服装是我们所熟悉的，也成了普通辨别民族的简单标志。各民族在饮食上也有差别，而且从小所养成饮食的习惯并不是很容易改变的。在城市发展中，民族食堂的设立已成了一个现实的需要。房屋的建筑，交通工具的形式也是如此。在生活用具上所表现的民族特点，一方面固然和各民族的生产情况有关，比如牧区民族穿皮革和毛织品、吃肉类乳品、住蒙古包、骑马、拉大轮车，和西南山区民族穿麻织品、吃糯米、住竹建的楼房，背运货品等，都是明显的例子；但是深入研究他们所有的形式，比如在同样地理条件下生活的各民族，有的好白，有的尚黑，有的又喜欢蓝色、红色，这种种形式上的特点却不是从生产情况简单地能加以说明的。我们必须结合这些民族的历史来进行研究。各民族在生活用具上所有的特点，并不都会因社会性质的改变而起根本的变化，他们很可以带着许多这类特点进入社会主义社会。
　　⒉人们的社会生活，就是有关人与人关系的风俗习惯等。这方面的研究，首先应当注意那些和社会性质有密切联系的情况，就是说不论什么民族，在一定的发展阶段上都会发生同样的情况。比如在原始社会里，血缘关系是社会关系的基本纽带，环绕着决定亲属关系的生活节目上常常有许多繁缛的仪式活动。这些都是某一社会发展阶段的共同的特点。但是某一社会发展阶段的共同特点又可以在不同程度上，以残余形式保留在其后的各阶段中，而且可以在旧的形式中发展了新的内容。这些情况不但可以迷惑社会性质的分析，也使社会生活的研究更为复杂。
　　在阶级社会里人们社会生活表现的共同特点就是阶级的区别。这种区别可以很大，甚至形成了“两种文化”。所以在研究这种社会时，首先要注意这个特点。过去常常有人把某一民族的统治阶级的生活方式作为这一个民族的特点，那是错误的。
　　研究阶级社会各阶级的社会生活时还应当注意剥削阶级对劳动人民的影响。剥削阶级的生活方式在阶级社会里是处于统治地位，剥削阶级还要利用他们的权力来推行有利于他们的种种风俗习惯。比如歧视妇女，甚至如缠脚等一类的风俗显然是对劳动人民不利的，但是由于剥削阶级的提倡和推行，在劳动人民中也有通行的。因此社会生活的阶级性的分析并不是简单的。
　　在劳动人民中，他们的社会生活大多密切地同他们的生产活动相结合。比如节令的性质就常是生产活动的动员和收获的庆祝；庙会、跳场等群众性集会常和贸易活动结合在一起。这些社会活动固然在生产中起着一定的积极作用，但是在生产技术的改造过程中，那些联系于落后技术的风俗习惯也可以起阻碍改造的消极作用。在有关养生送死的许多风俗习惯中同样应当注意这种情况。劳动人民的许多生活经验常被固定在风俗习惯里，当这些风俗习惯形成的时候可以有积极的作用，但是生活条件改变了，这些风俗习惯却成了维护落后形式的力量，那就成了进步的阻碍。比如有许多禁忌虽则是有一定的卫生价值的，但是也可以成为传播科学知识的阻碍。更重要的是有些风俗习惯在当前对生产的发展很不利，甚至影响到民族的发展。因此，我们对于劳动人民的风俗习惯也必须加以批判地接受，不应当一律称作民族特点而要求保存和发展。民族学者的调查研究就可以帮助各民族人民重新估计他们的风俗习惯。
　　⒊艺术和文学是各民族文化和生活的重要部分。不论社会发展到什么阶段，没有一个民族不在这方面有它独特的创造。有些人以为生产落后的民族是没有艺术和文学的，那是和事实不符的。在我国的少数民族中，有些在经济上还是落后的，但同样有可贵的艺术品；比如台湾的高山族经济上还相当原始，但是他们浮雕的图腾版却具有很高的艺术水平，他们所编织的贝衣，已有很长的历史，同样是极美的工艺品；大凉山的彝族所用的餐具和马鞍上绘着精美的色彩和花纹，苗族和僮族的竹器，即是很简单的鱼篓，在艺术上都有很高的评价。各少数民族的文学作品也是如此。各族人民都有丰富的口头创作。云南撒尼族的长诗“阿诗玛”一经记录和翻译了出来，已经赢得全国文艺界的推崇。至于文字发达的民族，文学的遗产保留得更多了。蒙古族的“格斯尔的故事”和藏族的“米拉日巴的一生”都是已经为大家所知道的例子。音乐舞蹈等方面的情况也是如此。这些劳动人民所创造、为劳动人民所爱好的历代保留下来的艺术和文学，不但是各民族宝贵的遗产，而且是我们祖国民族大家庭值得骄傲的共同财富。
　　各民族艺术上的创造提供了美术、文学、音乐和舞蹈多方面丰富的研究资料，这些资料对于民族学者同样是极可宝贵的。民族学者一方面应当以这些作品所反映的生活内容来丰富自己对这些民族各时期社会生活的认识，比如“阿诗玛”的长诗就生动地反映了青年男女的爱情和当时阶级社会的矛盾，使我们对撒尼的社会性质有了亲切的体会。另一方面，民族学者还应当从这些民族的历史条件来了解他们艺术风格的形成和变化，比如黔东苗族的音乐和舞蹈上表现出沉重、抑制、内向和细致的风格，这种风格可能是和他们长期缺乏自己的政权、被压迫和被分散的历史分不开的。解放后，从他们歌颂毛主席等曲子上所流露出来的兴奋、感激和舒畅的声调也正反映了他们从生死关头获得新生的情绪。又比如蒙古的音乐在历史上曾经发生过长短调的变化，而这种变化提示了当时社会上可能发生的重大变革。各民族艺术和文学上的作品也常常给我们看到各民族间文化交流的证据，比如藏族在唐代和汉族的密切关系还反映在他们现有的音乐、舞蹈上。我们在这里所举的例子由于缺乏研究可能是不正确的，但是可以提示我们民族学者在这方面的研究工作有着广阔的园地。
　　关于少数民族艺术文学的研究，对各民族的发展有重大的意义。我国的各少数民族都处在形成社会主义民族的阶段。艺术和文学在发展社会主义民族共同心理这个特征上起着重要的作用，同时，社会主义民族的形成也给了各民族人民发展民族艺术和文学创造了最好的条件。可以预见在他们形成社会主义民族的时期里必然会有伟大的作品出现。
