To Egyptian Families,

“Nationalize the Suez Canal!” “Egyptians will build the Aswan Dam themselves!” “No country, no nation, no group can intimidate us!” What resounding and resolute voices! What inspiring news!

Greetings! Egyptian fathers, mothers, and youths! Greetings! Every Egyptian family! Our whole family is moved by your bold actions, and we extend to you our highest respect!

Although Cairo is so far away from Shanghai, our hearts are so close today. The Chinese people have suffered deeply from imperialist aggression and oppression, and have won national independence and freedom through their own struggles. Therefore, we can more profoundly understand the full significance of your just struggle and more keenly appreciate your ardent and firm feelings.

Dear Egyptian fathers, mothers, and youths, there are four people in our family. Both my parents are history teachers, and they have repeatedly lectured in class about the glorious history of your ancient civilization and the history of blood and tears of the Suez Canal. However, today the Suez Canal, created by the blood and sweat of the Egyptian people, has finally returned to Egypt's embrace, forever ending its history of blood and tears. It is smiling. The descendants of the ancient civilization are personally writing the brilliant epic of modern Egypt. The two history teachers in our family will tell their students about your great struggle with excitement and reverence. Our eldest son is a journalist, and he is working with his colleagues to report the news of your victorious struggle to our people. Chinese journalists and all progressive public opinion in the world support you. Let the voice of truth and justice overwhelm all slander and clamor! The youngest member of our family—our little son—is a student in the water conservancy department of a university. He has a more intimate understanding and deeper feelings about the Aswan Dam and the Suez Canal than anyone else in the family. Chinese water conservancy workers are using and transforming rivers to benefit the people. How eagerly they look forward to their Egyptian counterparts! Based on their own personal experience, they firmly believe that the Egyptian people will definitely be able to manage the Suez Canal well, and the Aswan Dam will definitely be built by the Egyptians!

These days, the first thing we do when we get up is to turn on the radio to listen to news about your just struggle. In the evening, we anxiously wait to read the day's "People's Daily." We carefully read the relevant commentaries and news. Whenever our family gathers together, we always talk about your struggle, talk about you. In short, as we enjoy our happy family life and build our beautiful motherland with pride, how much we care about you and how much we sympathize with your just struggle!

We sincerely wish you final victory in your struggle to safeguard sovereignty and independence, and wish every one of your families a more pleasant and happier life.

A Chinese Family

    给埃及家庭
    “把苏彝士运河收归国有！”“埃及人要自己来建造阿斯旺水坝！”“没有任何国家、任何民族、任何集团可以吓倒我们！”……这是何等响亮、坚决的声音！这是多么振奋人心的消息！
    敬礼！埃及的父亲、母亲和青年们！敬礼！每个埃及家庭！我们全家为你们这种果敢的行动所激动，我们向你们致以最崇高的敬意！
    开罗距离上海虽然是那么遥远，然而今天我们的心却是这样相近。中国人民深受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫，又用自己的斗争换得了国家、民族的独立和自由，因此，我们也就能够更深刻地了解你们的正义斗争的全部意义，更亲切地体会到你们如此热烈和坚定的心情。
    亲爱的埃及父亲、母亲和青年们，我们全家四个人，其中爸爸妈妈都是历史教员，他们曾经不止一次地在课堂上讲述过你们这个文明古国的光荣历史，也讲述过苏彝士运河的血泪史。然而，今天由埃及人民血汗创造的苏彝士运河终于回到埃及的怀抱，永远结束了它的血泪史，它欢笑了。文明古国的子孙正在亲手撰写现代埃及光辉灿烂的史诗，我们家庭中的这两位历史教员，将以激动、崇敬的心情向学生讲述你们的伟大斗争。我们家中的大儿子是一个新闻工作者，他正跟自己的同行一起向我国人民报道你们胜利斗争的消息。中国新闻工作者和世界上一切进步的舆论都支持你们，让真理和正义的声音压倒一切污蔑和叫嚣！我们家中最小的一个——小儿子，是一个大学水利系的学生，他比家里任何一个人对阿斯旺水坝、对苏彝士运河有更亲切的体会，更深厚的感情。中国水利工作者正在利用和改造江河为人民谋福利，他们对埃及的同行是抱着多么殷切的期望呵！根据自己亲身的体验，他们坚决相信埃及人民一定能够管理好苏彝士运河，阿斯旺水坝也一定能够在埃及人手里建造起来！
    这几天，我们起身第一件事，就是打开收音机收听有关你们正义斗争的消息；傍晚，我们又焦急地等待着阅读当天的“人民日报”。我们仔细地阅读有关的评论和新闻。每当我们家人聚集在一起时，总要谈到你们的斗争，谈到你们。总之，在我们享受着幸福的家庭生活时，在我们怀着自豪的心情，建设我们美好的祖国时，我们是多么关怀你们，又多么同情你们的正义斗争呵！
    我们衷心地祝福你们在维护主权和独立的斗争中获得最后的胜利，祝福你们每一个家庭都过得更愉快，更幸福。
                        中国一家庭
                上海江苏路五十四弄二十七号
