Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th - In Anhui Province, more than ten million mu of rice, corn, sorghum, cotton, millet and other crops blown down by the typhoon have all been straightened up and revived. More than 5.45 million mu of early rice that had not been harvested before the typhoon has also been rushed to completion. Most of the houses blown down or damaged by the typhoon have been repaired, and the disaster victims have been properly resettled in a timely manner. More than 90% of those injured or crushed in the fight against the typhoon have been completely cured. At present, millions of farmers in Anhui Province continue to drain water, repair ponds and embankments, strengthen field management of crops, increase late autumn planting, and develop diversified economic production, striving to make up for the losses caused by the typhoon.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the ability of farmers to resist natural disasters has been greatly enhanced compared to the past. This strong typhoon lasted for three days in Anhui Province. Despite vigorous protection and rescue efforts, it still suffered serious losses. After the typhoon, the fallen crops, damaged houses, destroyed ponds and embankments, and flooded farmland had to be rescued in a timely manner. Because agricultural production cooperatives in various places, according to the disaster situation, uniformly divided the labor force into shock teams for rushing to harvest, rushing to plant, draining water, and repairing houses and embankments, a comprehensive rescue activity was launched, which solved the difficulty of insufficient labor. In Fuyang Prefecture, more than 1.7 million farmers used methods such as mounding soil around roots and building frames to straighten up 80% of the fallen crops within three days after the typhoon.
    Because agricultural cooperatives in various places helped disaster-stricken members solve the difficulties of lack of bamboo, wood, reed mats, rice straw and manpower, the house repair work progressed rapidly. In Wuhu Prefecture, more than 157,000 of the more than 210,000 houses blown down and damaged were repaired within ten days.

    安徽省受台风灾害地区
    恢复工作进展很快
    新华社合肥17日电　安徽省各地被台风刮倒的一千多万亩水稻、玉米、高粱、棉花、谷子等作物已全部扶直复生。台风前没有收割完的545万多亩早稻也已抢收完毕。被台风刮倒刮坏的房屋多半已修好，灾民都及时得到了妥善安置。在与台风搏斗中受伤、砸伤的人90％以上都治疗全愈。现在，安徽省每天仍有千百万农民在继续排除积水，修复塘坝圩堤，加强农作物的田间管理，增种晚秋，开展多种经济的生产，力争弥补台风造成的损失。
    实现了农业合作化以后，农民抗御自然灾害的力量比以前大大增强。这次强台风在安徽全境持续了三天之久，虽经大力防护和抢救，仍受到严重的损失。台风过后，倒伏的庄稼，刮坏的房屋，冲毁的塘坝圩堤，淹没了的农田等，都要及时进行抢救，由于各地农业生产合作社根据受灾情况，统一把劳力分成抢收、抢种、排水、修复房屋、堤圩等突击组，展开了全面的抢救活动，解决了劳力不足的困难。阜阳专区一百七十多万农民在台风过后的三天内，用壅根培土、搭架等办法，把80％倒伏了的庄稼都扶直了。
    由于各地农业社帮助受灾社员解决了竹木、芦席、稻草等材料和人力缺乏的困难，使房屋修复工作进展迅速。芜湖专区被刮倒刮坏的二十一万多间房屋，十天内就修复了十五万七千多间。
