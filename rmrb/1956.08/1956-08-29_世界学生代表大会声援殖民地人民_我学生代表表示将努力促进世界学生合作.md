Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th. The Fourth World Student Congress continued in Prague on the afternoon of August 26th, chaired by Japanese student representative Tanaka.

    The first speaker was Czechoslovak student representative Tímar. He supported the proposals in the International Student Union Executive Committee report regarding expanding student cooperation and strengthening student solidarity.

    Sudanese student representative Giddari also spoke at the meeting. His speech mainly concerned the struggle of Sudanese students against colonialism. He also supported the unity of student groups.

    After extensive discussion, the Congress passed the following resolution proposed by Moroccan and Tunisian students: "The Congress supports the struggle of the people in colonial territories for their national independence, expresses its solidarity with them, and pays silent tribute to the students who died in the war."

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th. The Fourth World Student Congress continued its plenary session on the morning of August 27th.

    At the beginning of the meeting, attendees stood and observed a minute of silence for the students who sacrificed their lives in the Algerian national independence struggle. This action of the Congress was based on a proposal made by Moroccan and Tunisian student representatives at the afternoon session on August 26th.

    During the moment of silence, four or five observers from the National Union of Students of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland temporarily left the meeting hall. Their excuse was that their organization's regulations did not allow them to participate in any political demonstrations. However, the majority of observers from this union attending the Congress still took consistent action with the Congress. Observers from student groups in France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland did not stand for the moment of silence.

    Algerian student representative Malek spoke at the meeting. He said that Algerian students were currently in a difficult period. He called on students from all countries to firmly oppose colonialism and to support the just struggle of Algerian students by all means possible. Malek requested cooperation with French students on an equal footing and hoped that French youth could raise their own voices and demand an end to the unjust war being waged in Algeria.

    Hu Qili, head of the Chinese student delegation, spoke next. He supported the International Student Union's proposal regarding the unity of the student movement and called for expanded contacts between student groups from various countries. He said that international student cooperation should be conducted on an equal footing, should take common interests as its starting point, be based on mutual respect for others' opinions, non-interference in internal affairs, and the resolution of differences and disputes through patient consultation. Since the lives of students in various countries and the situations of various international student organizations are very complex, the forms of cooperation development should be diverse. Hu Qili also advocated for the development of regional student cooperation. He believed that increasing international student cooperation and unity is an arduous and long-term task that requires special patience in order to gradually achieve results.

    Hu Qili continued, saying that Chinese students, who have deeply suffered from colonial oppression, deeply sympathize with the struggle of students in colonial countries against colonialism. They fully support the just action of Egyptian students and people in nationalizing the Suez Canal Company to ensure national sovereignty and independence. Chinese students are concerned about the plight of Algerian students. They maintain that colonial rule in Algeria must end, and the bloody war there must be stopped. Chinese students also support the struggle of students and people in India and Indonesia to recover Goa and West Irian, respectively.

    Hu Qili said: We have invited students from Norway, France, Australia, and Pakistan to send delegations to China as guests. In order to increase contact and understanding between Chinese and American students, we have also invited the United States National Student Association to send a delegation of fifteen people to visit our country. We are awaiting a positive response from our American friends.

    He concluded by saying that Chinese students will spare no effort to promote the cause of world student cooperation.

    Tunisian student representative Karoui's speech mainly concerned the struggle of students against colonial oppression. He advocated convening a congress of representatives from all student groups.

    Fournier, a representative of the National Union of Students of France, said that the union had not participated in the International Student Union for several years, and therefore the French student delegation was attending the Congress as observers. Fournier continued by saying that the union had decided to participate in all international student conferences, including the Fourth World Student Congress, in order to establish contact between student groups.

    He suggested that a "Cooperation Conference" be held in 1957, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Union of Students of France, inviting all national organizations to participate. According to his opinion, this conference should study those issues on which everyone could cooperate. He referred to issues such as the reform of higher education, the economic and social needs of students, and cultural and sports exchanges.

    Hungarian student representative Kostoni supported the French student's proposal to convene a "Cooperation Conference."

    Next, representatives from student groups in Austria and Burma spoke.

    The last speaker at the morning meeting was the Vietnamese student representative, who emphasized that Vietnamese youth are prepared to cooperate with student groups from other countries.

    世界学生代表大会声援殖民地人民
    我学生代表表示将努力促进世界学生合作
    新华社布拉格28日电　第四次世界学生代表大会26日下午继续在布拉格举行，由日本学生代表田中担任主席。
    第一个发言的是捷克斯洛伐克学生代表蒂马尔。他支持国际学生联合会执行委员会报告中提出的关于扩大学生合作和加强学生团结的建议。
    苏丹学生代表吉达里也在会上发了言。他的发言大部分是谈苏丹学生同殖民主义的斗争。他也支持学生团体的团结。
    代表大会经过广泛的讨论后，通过了摩洛哥和突尼斯学生所提出的下列决议：“代表大会支持殖民地人民争取自己民族独立的斗争，对他们表示声援，并且向在战争中死难的学生默哀致敬”。
    据新华社布拉格28日电　第四次世界学生代表大会27日上午继续举行全体会议。
    在会议开始后，到会者起立为在阿尔及利亚民族独立斗争中牺牲了生命的学生默哀一分钟。大会的这一行动是根据摩洛哥和突尼斯的学生代表在26日下午会议上提出的建议而作出的。
    在默哀的时候，英格兰、威尔士及北爱尔兰全国大学生联合会的观察员中有四、五个人暂时退出了会场。他们的借口是他们的团体的规章不允许他们参加任何政治性质的示威行动。但是，这个联合会参加大会的大多数观察员仍然和大会采取了一致行动。法国、荷兰和瑞士的学生团体的观察员没有起立默哀。
    阿尔及利亚学生代表马列克在会上发了言。他说，阿尔及利亚学生现在正处在困难时期。他呼吁各国学生坚决反对殖民主义，并且用一切办法来支持阿尔及利亚学生的正义斗争。马列克要求同法国学生在平等的基础上进行合作，并且希望法国青年能够发出自己的呼声，要求停止在阿尔及利亚进行的非正义的战争。
    中国学生代表团团长胡启立接着发言。他支持国际学生联合会提出的关于团结学生运动的建议，并且号召扩大各国学生团体之间的联系。他说，国际学生合作应当在平等的基础上进行，应当以共同的利益作为出发点，以互相尊重别人意见、不干涉内部事务，并且以耐心协商来解决分歧和争端作为基础。由于各国学生生活和各个国际学生组织的情况是很复杂的，因此，合作的发展形式应当是多种多样的。胡启立还主张发展区域性的学生合作。他认为增进国际学生合作和团结是一项艰巨和长期的工作，需要表现特别的耐心以便逐步获得结果。
    胡启立接着说，曾经深受殖民主义压迫的中国学生深切同情殖民地国家的同学为反对殖民主义而进行的斗争。他们完全支持埃及学生和人民把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以保证国家主权和独立的正义行动。中国学生关心阿尔及利亚学生所处的困境。他们主张阿尔及利亚的殖民统治必须结束，那里的流血战争必须被制止。中国学生还支持印度和印度尼西亚的学生和人民分别为收复果阿和西伊里安而进行的斗争。
    胡启立说：我们已经邀请挪威、法国、澳大利亚和巴基斯坦的同学分别派遣代表团到中国去作客。为了增进中美学生之间的接触和了解，我们还邀请美国全国学生联合会派遣一个由十五人组成的代表团访问我国。我们正期待美国朋友的赞同的答复。
    他最后说，中国学生将不遗余力地促进世界学生的合作事业。
    突尼斯学生代表卡罗乌伊的发言，大部分是谈学生反对殖民压迫的斗争。他主张召开所有学生团体代表大会。
    法国全国学生联合会代表富尔尼埃说，我国的联合会好几年一直没有参加国际学生联合会，因此，这次法国学生代表团是作为观察员出席代表大会的。富尔尼埃接着说，联合会决定参加一切国际性的学生会议，包括第四次世界学生代表大会，以便建立学生团体之间的接触。
    他建议在1957年，在法国全国学生联合会成立五十周年的时候举行“合作会议”，邀请所有全国性的团体参加这次会议。根据他的意见，这次会议要研究对大家来说都有可能合作的那些问题。他指的是改革高等教育、学生的经济的和社会的需要、文化和体育联系等问题。
    匈牙利学生代表科斯托尼支持法国学生提出的召开“合作会议”的建议。
    接着是奥地利和缅甸的学生团体代表发言。
    在上午会议上最后一个发言的是越南学生代表，他强调越南青年准备同其他国家学生团体进行合作。
