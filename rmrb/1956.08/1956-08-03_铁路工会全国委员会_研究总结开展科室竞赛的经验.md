Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 1st. In response to the current weakness in the socialist competition among departments within the national railway design system, the All-China Railway Trade Union Committee recently convened relevant personnel from national railway design units in Lanzhou to study the existing problems and summarize successful experiences, in order to further promote departmental competitions in depth.

The most common problem in the current departmental competition within the railway design system is the infrequent and untimely evaluation and reward system. Some units have not evaluated the results of the competition for half a year. The outstanding collectives and individuals emerging from the competition do not receive the rewards they deserve, and the broad masses of workers cannot receive timely education through the evaluation, which affects the enthusiasm of the masses for competition. The competition indicators of some units are set too high and are not closely integrated with the administrative planning and management work. By the end of the month, everyone often fails to meet the competition conditions, and the administrative leaders of these units therefore do not pay much attention to the departmental competition. The cadres leading the departmental competition are all anxious about the failure to deepen the competition.

At the meeting, everyone studied and summarized the experience of the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, which has been doing well in carrying out departmental competitions. The design institute takes the main content of planning management—delivering agreement design documents on time—as the main indicator of the competition, ensuring the delivery of design documents to the construction department ahead of schedule and on time. Around this center, contracts are signed between departments and groups, and everyone also makes individual work plans, which not only have a common goal for everyone to strive for but also specific tasks for each person. In the past year or so, the design institute has also carried out monthly evaluation and reward work, and the enthusiasm of the masses for competition has been high. All technical personnel and administrative management personnel have been put into the competition, and many collectives and workers who were originally backward have now won the title of advanced producer. When evaluating and discussing competition indicators, the administrative leaders of the design institute also participate and express their support. In the first six months of this year, the First Design Institute overfulfilled its tasks and delivered the design documents on time. The phenomenon that design has lagged behind construction for many years has been basically eliminated since the launch of the departmental competition.

After discussion, everyone believed that the experience of the First Design Institute is precisely the right remedy for the current problems in the departmental competition. Everyone decided to promote the experience of the First Design Institute in the national railway design system departmental competition, break the current situation of insufficient momentum in the departmental competition, and further promote the socialist competition in depth.

### 铁路工会全国委员会  研究总结开展科室竞赛的经验

    铁路工会全国委员会
    研究总结开展科室竞赛的经验
    新华社兰州1日电　针对目前全国铁路设计系统科室社会主义竞赛劲头不足的缺点，中国铁路工会全国委员会最近召集了全国铁路设计单位有关人员在兰州开会，研究存在的问题，总结成功的经验，以便把科室竞赛深入开展下去。
    目前铁路设计系统科室竞赛存在的问题中，最普遍的是评比奖励不经常、不及时。有些单位半年没有评比一次竞赛结果，竞赛中涌现的优秀集体和个人得不到应有的奖励，广大职工也不能通过评比得到及时的教育，影响了群众的竞赛热情。一部分单位的竞赛指标订得偏高，也没有和行政方面的计划管理工作紧密结合起来，到月底的时候往往大家都完不成竞赛条件，这些单位的行政领导人员因此对科室竞赛不很重视。领导科室竞赛的干部都为竞赛不能深入开展下去而焦急。
    会上，大家研究和总结了科室竞赛开展得较好的铁道部第一设计院的经验。这个设计院以计划管理的主要内容——按期交出协议设计文件为竞赛的主要指标，保证提前和按期向施工部门交出设计文件。围绕这个中心，各科室、小组间签订联系合同，每个人也订出个人工作计划，不但有大家奋斗的共同目标，还有各人的具体任务。一年多来，这个设计院还月月进行评比奖励工作，群众竞赛热情高涨，所有技术人员和行政管理人员全部投入了竞赛，许多原来落后的集体和工人，现在已经获得先进生产者的称号。在进行评比和讨论竞赛指标的时候，设计院的行政领导人员也参加，表示支持。在今年头六个月中，第一设计院超额完成了任务，按期交出了设计文件。多年来设计落后于施工的现象，在科室竞赛开展以来，已经基本上消除了。
    经过讨论，大家认为第一设计院的这些经验正是针对目前科室竞赛存在问题对症下药的良方。大家决定，要在全国铁路设计系统科室竞赛中推广第一设计院的经验，打破目前科室竞赛劲头不足的局面，把社会主义竞赛深入开展下去。
