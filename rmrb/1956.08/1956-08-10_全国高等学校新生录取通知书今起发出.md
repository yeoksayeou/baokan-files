Xinhua News Agency, 9th: National universities and colleges will begin issuing the first batch of admission notices to new students starting today. More than 350,000 candidates will receive notification from their application institutions or the Higher Education Enrollment Committee of their respective regions regarding whether they have been admitted.

At the same time, in order to better accommodate the preferences of candidates, the Higher Education Enrollment Committees of various regions will issue voluntary application request notices to those candidates whose political and health conditions, as well as examination scores, are basically qualified, but whose desired schools and majors are already full. These candidates will then be selectively admitted based on their second choices.

With a guaranteed source of candidates, the number of new students enrolled by national universities and colleges this year will exceed the original enrollment plan. In terms of the quality of new students, the examination scores of those admitted to science, engineering, agriculture, and medical undergraduate programs are similar to the admission standards of last year; the quality of new students in literature, history, finance and economics, and political science and law has improved compared to last year.

Among the new students admitted to higher normal schools, 20,000 are graduates of secondary normal schools and primary school teachers.

In order to give returned overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau who did not make the unified entrance examination in mid-July the opportunity to take the entrance examination, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have specially designated the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education to hold a supplementary examination in Guangzhou in mid-August for them, in conjunction with Sun Yat-sen University, South China Institute of Technology, and other institutions.

    全国高等学校新生录取通知书今起发出
    新华社9日讯　全国高等学校从十日起将发出第一批新生录取通知书。三十五万多名考生将要从报考学校或各地区高等学校招生工作委员会得到是否被录取的通知。
    在这同时，各地区高等学校招生工作委员会为了更好地照顾考生志愿，对于政治条件、健康条件、考试成绩基本上合格，但志愿报考的学校和专业已经满额的这一部分考生，将发出征求志愿通知书，再根据他们第二次选择的志愿，择优录取。
    在考生来源得到保证的情况下，全国高等学校今年招收的新生将超过原来的招生计划。在新生质量方面，今年录取的理、工、农、医类本科的考试成绩，和去年录取标准相近；文、史、财经、政法类的新生质量，比较去年有了提高。
    高等师范学校录取的新生中，有两万人是中等师范学校的毕业生和小学教师。
    为了使没有赶上七月中旬统一招生考试的归国华侨学生和香港、澳门学生有考试入学的机会，高等教育部、教育部和华侨事务委员会特指定广东省教育厅会同中山大学、华南工学院等校，八月中旬在广州为他们举行一次补考。
