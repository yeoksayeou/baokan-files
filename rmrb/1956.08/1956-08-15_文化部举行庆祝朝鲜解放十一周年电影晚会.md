Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China held a Korean film reception tonight to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    The Korean film "Newlyweds" was shown at the reception. The film vividly depicts the life of a newly married couple: the wife resolutely takes up a job, no longer content with just family life, and the husband changes his erroneous attitude towards work and his wife, building a new relationship through shared labor. The film criticizes the erroneous viewpoints of individual heroism in labor competitions and the underestimation of women's labor. A Korean color documentary depicting the Korean people celebrating the tenth anniversary of their liberation was also shown at the reception.

    Heads of the Ministry of Culture and other relevant ministries, people from all walks of life in the capital, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, Kim Kwi-nam, and other diplomatic envoys to China attended the reception.

    文化部举行庆祝朝鲜解放十一周年电影晚会
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国文化部在今晚举行朝鲜电影晚会，庆贺朝鲜解放十一周年。
    会上放映了朝鲜影片“新婚夫妻”。影片有趣地描写了一对新婚夫妻的生活：妻子从满足于小家庭生活而坚决走上工作岗位，丈夫改变了对工作、对妻子的错误态度，在共同的劳动中建立新感情。影片批判了在劳动竞赛中的个人英雄主义和轻视妇女劳动的错误观点。会上还放映了描述朝鲜人民欢庆解放十周年情景的朝鲜彩色纪录片。
    文化部和其他有关各部负责人，首都各界人士，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使馆临时代办金贵南和其他各国驻华使节出席了晚会。
