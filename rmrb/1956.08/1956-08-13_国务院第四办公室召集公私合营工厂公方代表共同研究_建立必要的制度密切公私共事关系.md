Xinhua News Agency, 11th – A symposium of public representatives from joint public-private factories, focusing on the study of public-private partnership, was held in Beijing from August 1st to 10th.

The meeting was hosted by the Fourth Office of the State Council, with the participation of more than 100 people, including public representatives from joint public-private factories in various provinces and cities, managers of specialized companies, and representatives from central industrial departments and relevant units.

According to reports from representatives from various regions, the main problem currently existing in the relationship between public and private parties is that, although personnel from both sides in many factories are superficially respectful, the relationship is not close enough.

The meeting concluded that there are many reasons for the lack of close relationships between public and private parties. In some cases, public representatives are cautious in their work and are afraid to actively utilize private personnel, resulting in excessive involvement and substitution. In other cases, private personnel themselves are afraid of taking responsibility and are not proactive enough in their daily work. Some cases are due to differing opinions among Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League members within the enterprise; others because employees do not fully understand the Party's policy of transforming private personnel. In addition, the lack of certain systems and methods in public-private partnership is also a reason for the lack of close public-private relations.

The meeting unanimously agreed that after the joint public-private ownership of the entire industry and the fixed interest rate, the relations of production in the factory have undergone fundamental changes, from workers' supervision of production in capitalist enterprises to state management of production under fixed interest rate conditions. This makes it possible to more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and give full play to the technology and experience of private personnel to improve the production of joint public-private enterprises. Everyone believes that the majority of private personnel possess production technology and business management knowledge, which is needed for the country's socialist construction. Since liberation, private personnel have undergone a seven-year transformation process, and the vast majority of them have expressed their willingness to take the socialist road under the leadership of the working class. As long as their education and transformation are strengthened, they will be able to overcome their ideological and stylistic shortcomings and better serve socialist construction.

Regarding how to carry out education and transformation work for private personnel, the meeting, after exchanging experiences in this area from various regions, pointed out that it is necessary to rely on the broad masses of workers under the leadership of the Party to educate and transform private personnel in enterprises through production practice, so that they understand the laws of social development, destroy capitalism, establish socialism, accept the leadership of the Party in their daily work, study hard, work actively, establish the view of relying on the masses, attaching importance to product quality and production safety, and gradually transform themselves into self-reliant laborers. At the same time, everyone believes that improving the relationship between public and private partners is an important link in the current education and transformation of private personnel and the improvement of production. There are many ways to educate and transform private personnel, such as inviting them to participate in various administrative meetings on production and operation, organizing them to participate in socialist competitions, holding regular symposiums between public and private parties, organizing them to study, and inviting them to participate in various social activities. These are all effective methods.

The meeting pointed out that in order to improve the relationship between public and private partners, there must be a clear division of labor between the public and private parties. Public representatives should first respect the powers of private personnel, avoid monopolizing and substituting their work, help them improve their political and professional levels, and support their correct opinions so that they can have the power and responsibility to fulfill their duties. The Party, the Communist Youth League, and the labor union should educate employees to respect the job leadership of private personnel within their professional scope.

The meeting believed that consulting with private personnel is not only for the purpose of educating private personnel, but also for absorbing their opinions to improve work and avoid possible errors in work. Therefore, public representatives must be modest and sincere when consulting with private personnel, and patiently listen to the opinions of private personnel; if there are disagreements on issues that do not require urgent resolution, they can refrain from making decisions immediately and continue to study and consult to achieve better solutions. If the private personnel have different views on certain issues of the factory Party committee during the consultation process, and these views are correct, the Party committee should consider revising its own opinions. If the opinions of the private personnel are inappropriate, they should also be clarified to the private personnel in order to reach a consensus.

The meeting emphasized that carrying out education and transformation of factory private personnel is the common task of the factory Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League. The factory Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League should list the work of public-private partnership as one of their daily tasks. Public representatives should regularly report on the situation of public-private partnership to the factory Party committee and put forward specific opinions requiring the labor union and the Communist Youth League to cooperate and collaborate. The persons in charge of the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League should ideally hold regular symposiums with private personnel to study and solve problems existing in public-private partnership.

According to the new situation that the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes after the implementation of joint public-private ownership and fixed interest rates in factories, the meeting requested the labor union to cooperate with the administration to organize socialist labor competitions, do a good job in production, and regularly conduct political and ideological education and united front policy education for the broad masses of workers. At the same time, assist the administrative department in doing a good job in educating and transforming private personnel and their families. The enterprise's Communist Youth League should strengthen the education of private young personnel. The general membership meetings, recreational, sports, and learning activities convened by the labor union can absorb the participation of private personnel.

When discussing which systems and methods need to be established in public-private partnership, representatives from various regions put forward the following suggestions and requirements:

	1. Private personnel may read administrative documents and reports that they should read within their job scope and may participate in meetings that they should participate in within their job scope.
	2. In newly established joint ventures, since various management systems have not yet been formally determined, some relatively major internal issues of the enterprise can be discussed through the democratic management committee.
	3. It is suggested that the factory and industry's board of directors, in addition to carrying out their original work, can also negotiate on public-private partnership relations, contact shareholders, adjust relations between private personnel, and carry out education for private personnel.
	4. Public representatives should work well with private personnel and relevant departments to arrange activities for private personnel inside and outside the factory. It is suggested that the Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the factory public representatives strengthen their contact.
	5. It is required that the provincial and municipal united front departments strengthen their leadership over joint public-private enterprises. It is hoped that the transmission of relevant united front work issues will be transmitted directly to the factory Party committee and comrades responsible for united front work as much as possible to avoid delays; it is suggested that documents on the policy of transforming private parties be sent directly to the grass-roots enterprise Party committees.

### 国务院第四办公室召集公私合营工厂公方代表共同研究  建立必要的制度密切公私共事关系

    国务院第四办公室召集公私合营工厂公方代表共同研究
    建立必要的制度密切公私共事关系
    新华社11日讯　以研究公私共事为主题的公私合营工厂公方代表座谈会，自八月一日至十日在北京举行。
    会议由国务院第四办公室主持，参加的有各省市公私合营工厂的公方代表和专业公司经理、中央各工业部门和有关单位代表一百多人。
    根据各地代表汇报，目前在公私共事关系上存在的主要问题是：不少工厂的公私双方人员，虽然表面上相敬如宾，但是关系上不够密切。
    会议认为形成公私共事关系不够密切的原因，是多方面的。有的是公方代表在工作中谨小慎微，不敢积极发挥私方人员的作用，因而工作上包揽过多，形成代替；有的是因为私方人员本身怕负责任，在日常工作中主动积极不够；有的是由于企业内的党政工团意见不一；有的因为职工对党的改造私方人员的政策了解不够。此外，在公私共事方面还缺少某些制度和办法，也是公私关系不够密切的原因。
    会议一致认为全行业公私合营和定息以后，工厂中的生产关系，已经发生了根本的变化，从资本主义企业的工人监督生产转变为定息条件下的国家管理生产。这就有可能更充分地发动群众的积极性和充分发挥私方人员的技术和经验来提高公私合营企业的生产。大家认为私方人员中的大多数具有生产技术和经营管理的知识，这些知识是国家的社会主义建设所需要的。解放以来，私方人员经过了七年的改造过程，他们中间的绝大部分都表示愿意在工人阶级领导下走社会主义的道路。只要加强对他们的教育改造，就能够克服他们在思想上、作风上的缺点，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    关于如何对私方人员进行教育改造工作，会议在交流了各地这方面的经验以后，指出：必须在党的领导下，依靠广大职工，通过生产实践来教育改造企业的私方人员，使他们懂得社会发展的规律，破资本主义，立社会主义，在日常工作中接受党的领导，努力学习，积极工作，树立依靠群众、重视产品质量和生产安全的观点，逐步地改造成为自食其力的劳动者。同时大家认为搞好公私共事关系又是当前教育改造私方人员和搞好生产的重要环节。教育改造私方人员的方式是多种多样的，如请他们参加生产经营的各种行政会议，组织他们参加社会主义竞赛，公私双方定期召开座谈会，组织他们学习，请他们参加各种社会活动，这些都是行之有效的办法。
    会议指出，要使公私共事关系搞好，公私双方必须有明确的分工。公方代表应当首先尊重私方人员的职权，不要包办代替他们的工作，帮助他们提高政治水平和业务水平，支持他们正确的意见，使他们能够有职有权，守职尽责。党、团、工会应当教育职工尊重私方人员业务范围内的职务领导。
    会议认为，和私方人员进行协商，不单是为了教育私方人员，而且也是为了吸收他们的意见以改进工作，避免工作中可能发生的差错。因此公方代表和私方人员协商的时候，必须虚心诚恳，耐心听取私方人员的意见；如果在不是迫切需要解决的问题上意见不一致，可以不急于做出决定，继续研究协商，求得更好地解决。工厂党委对某些问题的意见，在协商过程中，假使私方人员有不同看法，而这种看法是正确的，党委应该考虑修改自己的意见。如果私方人员的意见是不恰当的，也应当向私方人员说清楚，以便取得一致意见。
    会议强调指出，对工厂私方人员进行教育改造是工厂党政工团的共同任务。工厂的党政工团应当把公私共事方面的工作列为日常工作之一。公方代表要经常向工厂党委汇报公私共事的情况，提出要求工会和青年团配合协作的具体意见。工厂的党政工团的负责人最好能定期和私方人员开座谈会，研究和解决公私共事中存在的问题。
    会议根据工厂在实行了公私合营和定息以后生产关系已经发生根本变化的新情况，要求工会配合行政，组织社会主义劳动竞赛，搞好生产，经常对广大职工进行政治思想教育和统一战线政策教育。同时，协助行政部门做好教育改造私方人员及其家属的工作。企业的青年团要加强对私方青年人员的教育工作。工会召开的全体会员大会以及文娱、体育、学习等活动，可以吸收私方人员参加。
    在讨论公私共事中，需要建立那一些制度和办法的时候，各地代表提出了以下建议和要求：
    1、私方人员可以阅读他们职务范围以内应该阅读的行政文件和表报，可以参加他们职务范围以内应该参加的会议。
    2、在新合营工厂中，由于各项管理制度尚未正式确定，可以通过民主管理委员会讨论一些企业内部比较重大的问题。
    3、建议工厂和行业的董事会，除了进行原有的工作外，还可以协商公私共事关系、联系股东、调整私方人员之间的关系，以及对私方人员进行教育等工作。
    4、公方代表应当和私方人员及有关部门，很好地安排私方人员厂外厂内的活动。建议民主建国会、工商业联合会和工厂公方代表之间，加强联系。
    5、要求省市统战部门加强对公私合营企业的领导，有关统战工作问题的传达，希望尽可能直接向工厂党委和负责统战工作的同志传达，以免耽误时间；有关对私方改造政策的文件，建议直接发至基层企业党委。
