Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 19th: The first batch of thirty-eight "Jiefang" brand trucks manufactured by the First Automobile Works were loaded onto a train tonight and transported to Beijing.

After these trucks arrive in Beijing, they will participate in this year's National Day parade. Soon after, the second batch of trucks will also be transported to Beijing.
