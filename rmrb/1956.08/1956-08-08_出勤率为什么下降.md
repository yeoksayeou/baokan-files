    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Agricultural production cooperatives in Enshi County, Hubei Province, are experiencing difficulties due to the continuous decline in attendance rates of female members, resulting in labor shortages, especially as the busy autumn harvest season approaches.
    Rural women in Enshi County have a long-standing habit of labor, and women account for more than one-third of the labor force in many agricultural cooperatives. However, due to the county, district, and township Party organizations' laissez-faire attitude towards the work of nurseries during the busy farming season, more than one-third of the more than 2,200 permanent or temporary nurseries established between April and May this year have collapsed. As a result, the labor attendance rate of women has dropped by more than 20% compared with April and May.
    Wen Jieping, director of the Enshi County Women's Federation, said: The reason for this problem is that the leading cadres of the county and district Party and government do not pay enough attention to leading the agricultural cooperatives in running nurseries during the busy farming season. They believe that this is a trivial matter of "old women" and do not care about it. The problem of excessively high or low remuneration for nannies in the farm-busy nurseries run by agricultural cooperatives has not been resolved for a long time. If the remuneration is too high, the members are unwilling to send their children to the nurseries; if it is too low, no one is willing to work as a nanny. Many agricultural cooperatives hope that the leading cadres of the county and district will help solve this problem, and unanimously believe that if this problem is solved, the difficulty of insufficient labor in each cooperative can be overcome.

    出勤率为什么下降
    据新华社讯　湖北省恩施县的农业生产合作社由于妇女社员出勤率不断下降，产生了劳动力不够用的困难，特别是在当前繁忙的秋收季节快要到来的时候。
    恩施县农村妇女一向有劳动习惯，许多农业社在生产中有三分之一以上是妇女，但由于县、区、乡党组织对农忙托儿组的工作放任自流，今年四、五月间建立的二千二百多个常年的或临时的托儿组，有三分之一已经垮了，以致妇女劳动出勤率比四、五月间下降了20％多。
    恩施县妇女联合会主任温洁苹说：发生这个问题的原因，是县和区的党政领导干部对领导农业社办农忙托儿站的工作重视不够。他们认为这是婆婆妈妈无关紧要的小事，不闻不问。农业社办的农忙托儿所，媬姆报酬畸高畸低现象长期得不到解决，高了社员不愿送托，低了又无人愿干媬姆。许多农业社都希望县区领导干部帮助解决这个问题，一致认为：如果这个问题解决了，各社劳动力不够用的困难是可以克服的。
