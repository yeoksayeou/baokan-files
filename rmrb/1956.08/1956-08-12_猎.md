    Hunting
    Jin Ke
    Early Sunday morning, I borrowed an air rifle, preparing to go to the suburbs to shoot sparrows. Before leaving, I hesitated for a moment. Since the war years, I hadn't touched any firearms. Besides, there are fewer sparrows now, and the remaining ones are easily startled. They fly away at the slightest glimpse of a person.
    "Go, go! You could hit the Japanese devils and reactionaries, can't you hit a sparrow? You don't act like a sharpshooter from back then!" my sister pushed me out the door.
    After crossing the Huai River, I entered the fence of a farmhouse. A sparrow was leisurely perched on the roof ridge. Just as I was about to aim, an old woman shouted from inside the house, "Comrade, don't shoot! My little grandson is sleeping. The gunshot will scare him!"
    "Grandma, this gun won't make a sound," I explained with a smile, but she wouldn't believe me. By the time I was about to explain further, the sparrow had already flown away, and I couldn't find a second one.
    Just when I was getting anxious, a middle-aged man who looked like a postman came out of the gate of the agricultural production cooperative, pushing a bicycle.
    "Did you get any?" he asked.
    "No!" I replied dejectedly.
    He touched his neck and looked around, seemingly also anxious for me. Suddenly, his face lit up, as if he had remembered something.
      "Go to Xijia Port Station to shoot! There are so many sparrows there, and they aren't afraid of people. The day before yesterday, I saw two kids using slingshots to hit four!" He pointed towards the north, and at the end of a soybean field, several red rooftops were vaguely visible. "That's Xijia Port Station, about ten li away from the Huai embankment, and you have to wade through two or three streams."
    I waded through the last stream and washed the mud off my feet under a large tree. The rustling of the reeds in the wind and the chirping of various birds flying in the reeds and bushes lulled me into a drowsy state. Suddenly, several sparrows appeared on a nearby weeping branch. My heart stirred, and my fatigue dissipated.
    I fired a shot, but the sparrows continued to chirp freely on the branches. What was going on? I opened the gun barrel, and, oh, the bullet hadn't been fired! I cocked it again, but the sparrows noticed someone on the ground and flew away noisily.
    I approached the station building, where many young men and women were setting up ladders and climbing onto the station building to collect baby sparrows and sparrow eggs. The sparrows in the surrounding trees were making a racket. I walked over with the air rifle, and the railway workers greeted me with smiles.
    "You've come at just the right time. With a gun, it will be easier to deal with them."
    "It won't work, my gun is broken!"
    A young worker invited me into the room and handed me a glass of cold tea. He carefully studied the gun's problem with me. We checked it back and forth and found a crack on the firing cap that would cause air leakage, so the air pressure couldn't push the bullet out. The gun's owner had originally taped it with tape. A soldier waiting for the train suggested adding another layer of tape. At that moment, the staff at the station had found new tape, and we taped it on.
    I shot at the sparrows, but only knocked off many sparrow feathers. I just couldn't kill them. One sparrow was about to fall to the ground, but flew away with the bullet. The scorching sun was burning hot, and I was covered in sweat. The deafening cicada song and the sight of the tall hollyhocks seemed to increase my irritation.
    In front of the kind and enthusiastic young men and women, I suppressed my impatience and removed the tape from the gun again, then taped on three layers of tape. I fired five shots in a row, and five sparrows fell. My heart calmed down a lot, and the workers and girls laughed happily. A dark-skinned, smiling girl took a piece of hemp string to tie the sparrows together one by one for me. She said with a smile, "If I had a gun, I could guarantee we'd complete our branch's task of one hundred and twenty in three mornings."
    The particularly enthusiastic young worker insisted on dragging me to his house for lunch. We ate steamed buns and scrambled eggs with chives. The taste reminded me of the war years, when the villagers risked their lives to send food to the battlefield.
    After lunch, everyone was unwilling to rest and wanted to take me to the place with the most sparrows.
    In the afternoon, I took a southbound passenger train back to Bengbu. In the carriage, people looked at me in surprise as I held a string of twenty-five sparrows, but they didn't know that I had also given thirty-two to the people who enthusiastically helped me at Xijia Port.
    My sister greeted me at Bengbu Station. She took the sparrow string in one hand and the air rifle in the other.
    "Soldier, hurry home and take a refreshing bath, then find a cool place to take a nap. Before you wake up, I'll make five-spice fried sparrows. Tonight, we'll have dinner with Mom!"

专栏：我怎样度过一个星期日？

    猎
    金可
    星期天的大清早，我借到一支汽枪，准备到郊外打麻雀去。临走前，我迟疑了片刻，从战争年代过去以后，我就再也没摸过什么枪支；加上现在麻雀少了，残余的一些早都被人们打惊了，只见人影一闪，它们就一溜烟地飞掉了。
    “去，去！鬼子和反动派都打得着，还打不着麻雀吗？哪像个当年的射击手！”妹妹推着我出门。
    渡过淮河，我走进一家农舍的篱落，一只麻雀正悠闲地停在屋脊上。我刚要瞄准，突然，有位老大娘从屋里嚷着：“同志，不能开枪呀！我的小孙儿睡着了，开枪会吓着他！”
    “大娘，这支枪是不会响的。”我笑着向她解释，她哪里肯信。待我再要解释下去，那只麻雀已经逃掉了，我就再也找不到第二只麻雀。
    我正着急的时刻，一位邮递员模样的中年男人从农业生产合作社的大门里推着自行车出来。
    “打着了吗？”他问。
    “没有呢！”我懊丧地回答。
    他一手摸着脖子，眼睛向四野望了望，似乎也有些替我着急。突然间，他脸上显出活气，似乎想起什么。
      “你到奚家港车站去打！那里麻雀真多，又不怕人；前天我看见两个小孩拿弹弓打了四只！”说着，他用手朝正北里一指，在一片豆田的尽处，隐隐约约露出几片红色的房顶来，“那就是奚家港车站，从淮堤走过去约十里路远，还要趟两三处水。”
    我趟过最后一道溪流，在一株大树底下洗净了脚上的泥土。耳畔风吹芦苇的沙沙声，和飞鸣在苇草和灌木间的各种鸟雀的啼叫声，使我沉沉欲睡。忽然，有几只麻雀出现在近处的垂枝上，我心一动，疲劳消散了。
    我放了一枪，麻雀依然自由自在的在枝头上低唤着，怎么回事呢？我扳开枪筒，呀，子弹还没有射出去！我再扳了一下，麻雀发现草地上有人，噪着飞去了。
    我走近站房，许多姑娘、小伙们正架好梯子，爬到站房上去掏雏雀和雀蛋，四周树上的麻雀噪成一片。我提着汽枪走去，铁路工人们都笑着迎了出来。
    “来得正是时候，有了枪，就容易对付它们了。”
    “不行，我的枪坏了！”
    一个青年工人招呼我到屋里，随手又递过来一杯冷茶，他认真地和我研究枪出的毛病，我们扳过来扳过去地检查，发现在盖火上有一道裂缝会走汽，所以汽力顶不出子弹。枪主原来是用胶布贴住的，一位候车的军人便建议再贴一层胶布。当时站上的职员们已经找到新胶布，我们贴上了。
    我朝麻雀射去，结果打掉了许多麻雀的羽毛，就是打不死麻雀。有一只麻雀快要落到地面，又带着子弹飞走了。这时火热的太阳晒得烫人，我满身淌着汗，闹耳的蝉声和满眼一丈红的花朵，都仿佛增加我的火气。
    在亲切热情的小伙子和姑娘们面前我捺下性子，再把枪上的胶布拆下去，又贴上三层胶布。我一连发了五枪，便掉下五只麻雀来，我的心平静了许多，那些工人和姑娘们也都快活的笑了。一位皮肤黝黑、喜欢笑的姑娘拿一根麻线来替我把一只只的麻雀拴起来。她笑着说：“要是我也有一支枪的话，有三个早晨管保就能完成我们团支部的一百二十只的任务。”
    那位特别热情的青年工人硬拉我到他家里去吃午饭，吃的是馍馍和韭菜炒蛋皮，那滋味儿使我回想到战争年代，老乡们冒着生命危险往战场上送的饭菜。
    吃完饭，大家还不肯休息，要领我到麻雀最多的地方去。
    下午，我坐着一班南下客车回蚌埠来。在车厢里，人们惊讶地看我手提着一串二十五只麻雀，可是他们不晓得我还送给在奚家港热情帮助我的人们三十二只呢。
    妹妹迎到蚌埠车站上，她一手提过麻雀串儿，一手接过汽枪。
    “战士，快回家痛快洗个澡吧，然后再找个风凉地点睡一觉，不等你睡醒，我就把五香油炸麻雀做好，晚上，和妈妈一起吃晚饭！”
