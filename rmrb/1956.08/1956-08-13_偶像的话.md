    Words of an Idol
    Ai Qing

    In that famous old temple, there stood a tall statue. People beside it, even with their arms stretched straight, could not reach its knees. For many years, it had caused those who saw it to feel involuntarily solemn and respectful, to feel their own insignificance and humility, and thus to yearn for its salvation.

    This statue had stood for hundreds of years. It felt this was a kind of hard labor. Knowing it was powerless to help the masses who eagerly sought assistance from it, it felt ashamed and厌烦 (yànfán,厌烦 meaning annoyed or fed up), and finally spoke to those who worshipped it:

    "Mortals, how ridiculous are the things you do! You created me in your own image, magnified me, and wanted to generate power from me to suppress your restless spirits. But I am afraid of you.

    I dare to believe that the reason you created me is entirely because you lack self-confidence—look, what more can I have than you? And yet I do not possess what you yourselves have.

    If you were bolder, and smashed me to pieces, not a drop of blood would flow from my chest.

    Of course, I also know that your creation of me is also a bold act, because you are trying to make me an accomplice, to let me and you together deceive those who are weaker.

    I have suffered enough punishment. I have stood here for hundreds of years. Your ancestors sculpted me, and later you generations after generations pasted gold leaves all over my body, so that I could shine all over, but I loathe my position, just as I loathe hypocrisy.

    Please smash me to pieces, or else shrink me to the same size as you, and endow me with the blood necessary for life. If you could really do that, how grateful I would be to you—but this cannot be done.

    Therefore, I believe: it is still yourselves who can truly save you. And my existence can only illustrate your misfortune." After saying the last words, the statue suddenly collapsed like a large mountain.

    偶像的话
    艾青
    在那著名的古庙里，站立着一尊高大的塑像，人在他的旁边，伸直了手还摸不到他的膝盖。很多年以来，他都使看见的人不由自主地肃然起敬，感到自己的渺小，卑微，因而渴望着能得到他的拯救。
    这尊塑像站了几百年了，他觉得这是一种苦役，对于热望从他得到援助的芸芸众生，明知是无能为力的，因此他由于羞愧而厌烦，最后终于向那些膜拜者说话了：
    “众生啊，你们做的是多么可笑的事！你们以自己为模型创造了我，把我加以扩大，想从我身上发生一种威力，借以镇压你们不安定的精神。而我却害怕你们。
    我敢相信：你们之所以要创造我，完全是因为你们缺乏自信——请看吧，我比之你们能多些什么呢？而我却没有你们自己所具备的。
    你们假如更大胆些，把我捣碎了，从我的胸廓里是流不出一滴血来的。
    当然，我也知道，你们之创造我也是一种大胆的行为，因为你们尝试着要我成为一个同谋者，让我和你们一起，能欺骗更软弱的那些人。
    我已受够惩罚了，我站在这儿已几百年，你们的祖先把我塑造起来，以后你们一代一代为我的周身贴上金叶，使我能通体发亮，但我却嫌恶我的地位，正如我嫌恶虚伪一样。
    请把我捣碎吧，要末能将我缩小到和你们一样大小，并且在我的身上赋予生命所必须的血液，假如真能做到，我是多么感激你们——但是这是做不到的呀。
    因此，我认为：真正能拯救你们的还是你们自己。而我的存在，只能说明你们的不幸。”说完了最后的话，那尊塑像忽然像一座大山一样崩塌了。
