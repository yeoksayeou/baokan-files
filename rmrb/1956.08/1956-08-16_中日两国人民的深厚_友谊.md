The Chinese Peking Opera Troupe, entrusted by the Chinese people, visited neighboring Japan and introduced our classical drama art to the Japanese people, conveying the greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people. It was warmly welcomed by the Japanese people. Now, the delegation has returned to the motherland, bringing with them the deep feelings of the Japanese people for the Chinese people. I remember at the farewell banquet held by the delegation in Tokyo on July 16, I said to the Japanese friends from all walks of life present: "Today, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is not superficial, but sincere and profound. The hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people are as close as the geography of the two countries. After we return to our country, we will definitely cherish and convey the deep friendship of the Japanese people to all the Chinese people." At that time, more than 700 people in the audience—Japanese, overseas Chinese in Japan, and members of the delegation—responded with warm applause. The applause, louder and louder, continued for a long time. Indeed, the hearts of the people of the two countries were connected. Now, with excitement and joy, I will tell you about the situation of the delegation's visit and performance in Japan.

The Chinese Peking Opera Troupe visited Japan from Beijing on May 16 this year at the invitation of the Asahi Shimbun. From May 30 to July 12, the delegation performed a total of 32 shows in cities such as Tokyo, Fukuoka, Yahata, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Osaka, with an audience of more than 70,000 people (the last two shows were charity performances held to help Japanese war orphans and atomic bomb victims, and the ticket prices were reduced, so that nearly 10,000 ordinary people also had the opportunity to see the opera). About 10 million people across Japan watched the Peking Opera performances on television.

The delegation also had extensive contact with people from all walks of life in the Japanese cultural and art circles. In various cities in Japan, we held many symposiums and academic speeches with the Japanese traditional art circles, drama circles, academic circles, women's and student groups, and orally introduced the reform of Peking Opera and the situation of the drama movement in our country to them. In addition, we also met with overseas Chinese in Japan and had cordial conversations.

Wherever the delegation went, it was warmly welcomed by all circles in Japan. In Tokyo, more than 150 famous people from all walks of life in Japan, centered on the Japanese literary and art circles, formed a committee to welcome the Peking Opera Troupe. Sugiyama Motojiro, Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, received the leaders and famous Peking Opera actors of the delegation in the Japanese Diet Building and held a tea party. This was the first time that the Japanese Diet received a foreign drama delegation. In other cities, there were also organizations to welcome the Peking Opera Troupe. The heads of local councils and governments, such as the speaker, prefectural governor, county governor, and mayor, all came forward to welcome the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe. The local overseas Chinese also joyfully participated in the welcoming ranks of the delegation.

The delegation's performances in various parts of Japan attracted millions of viewers. Many people had to queue for several hours to buy tickets, and many others came from afar to see the show. In the theater, both men and women, young and old, watched with such absorption. They were extremely interested in every program. When the performance reached a climax, the audience cheered and applauded warmly. This joyful atmosphere made us forget that we were performing abroad. Outside the theater, people generally showed great interest in the Peking Opera Troupe's performance in Japan and gave it high praise. Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, said at a banquet that he had heard praise for Peking Opera everywhere in Japan. Otani Takejiro, President of the Shochiku Company of Japan, said: "I have been engaged in the theater business for sixty years, and I have never seen any theater troupe cause such a sensation as yours. This performance of Peking Opera in Japan is an unprecedented event on the Japanese stage in the past sixty years!" I would like to cite another fact as a supplement. On the evening of July 10, after the delegation held its closing performance in Tokyo, it also had to hold a closing ceremony. This practice is rare in Japan. At that time, some Japanese friends were very worried: "It's so late, the audience is tired of watching the show, are they still interested in the closing ceremony?" Indeed, this worry is reasonable: the audience was not invited by us, but paid for their own tickets to watch the show. They can leave at any time, and there is no restriction. However, when the closing ceremony was carried out according to the original plan, nearly 3,000 spectators, including many teenagers and children, sat quietly without moving. Their joyful eyes were focused on the stage, listening quietly to the speeches of the representatives of the Japanese side and the representatives of the Peking Opera Troupe, and applauding warmly. When Japanese social organizations and overseas Chinese in Japan presented flowers and gifts to the delegation, the applause from the audience became even louder. Finally, the entire audience raised their arms and shouted "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship!"

Why was the Peking Opera Troupe's performance in Japan so successful this time?

In 1919 and 1924, I went to Japan to perform twice. At that time, our country was in a state of poverty and weakness and was oppressed by imperialism. Chinese people were looked down upon. When I went to Japan to perform, all the funds, organization, and contacts depended only on my personal efforts and the help of a few Japanese friends to achieve some achievements. Although our art was welcomed by the Japanese people at that time, it was significantly different from today's situation. Now our country is independent and embarked on the road to prosperity. In recent years, 600 million Chinese people who have stood up have done a lot of beneficial things for the cause of human peace in the East and in the world. Our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved. This is the most basic reason why we are welcomed when performing abroad. For Japan, the deep sympathy and concern of our government and people for the Japanese people, and the sincere and generous friendly attitude shown in Sino-Japanese relations, have greatly moved the Japanese people. Therefore, the Japanese people are willing to make friends with the Chinese people. This time, they called the Peking Opera Troupe envoys of peace and friendship. Wherever the delegation went, the Japanese people enthusiastically shouted "Long live Japan-China friendship!" and sang the song "Tokyo-Beijing." The mayor of Kyoto, Takayama Gizo, said at the welcome meeting for the Peking Opera Troupe: "In the world, without the East, there is no world; in the East, without China, there is no Japan." He also said: "Some people regard diplomacy as diplomats wearing white gloves plus soldiers with swords, which is absurd! True diplomacy is the exchange of people's hearts, from which to achieve cultural, economic, and political exchanges." It was with such a mood that the Japanese people warmly received the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe.

The refined, beautiful, and expressive Peking Opera art intoxicated the Japanese audience. In particular, the highly collectivist spirit expressed by the reformed Peking Opera and the unified, complete, vivid, and harmonious artistic image were unanimously praised by the Japanese audience. Japanese audiences have reflected that Peking Opera art is an ancient art, but the Peking Opera of New China is full of youthful vitality.

Each actor in the delegation completed the task given by a play in the spirit of collectivism. Whether it is a soldier or a palace maid, under the highest goal of a play, they can play their role appropriately. Japanese drama circles believe that "the most significant feature of Peking Opera in New China is the high unity of the stage image," and they say that this is very difficult to achieve. Each program performed in Japan this time has different colors and different moods, each character in the play has its own unique features, and each program has been sorted out to strive for a clear plot and complete art. This makes the audience always refreshed and the mood of watching the show rising continuously. At first, many viewers were worried that they could not understand Peking Opera, and only walked into the theater with curiosity, but after watching it, they felt that although they could not understand the words, they could still understand the plot, and they became more and more interested in it. A novelist named Kotani Takeshi initially thought that the praise for Peking Opera was "exaggerated," so he went to see the play with a prejudice to pick faults. As a result, he was moved to tears. The next day, he also published an article in the newspaper, praising Peking Opera art endlessly.

The success of our performance in Japan this time should also be attributed to the warm care and strong help of Japanese friends and patriotic overseas Chinese. The Asahi Shimbun, the welcome committees in various places, and famous people from all walks of life gave the Peking Opera Troupe cordial receptions and many concrete help. Ichikawa Ennosuke sent his theater backstage manager and stage work leaders, Senda Koreya sent the stage supervisor of the Haiyuza, and the Zenshinza also sent an actor and a director to assist us. This brotherly friendship deeply moved us. Patriotic overseas Chinese living in various parts of Japan took out all their strength and took care of us meticulously. Many overseas Chinese helped the delegation work tirelessly, regardless of the wind, rain, or sun. Sometimes we asked them to take a rest, and they said: You are working for the motherland, and we are working for you is also working for the motherland; the glory won by the delegation for the motherland also has a share of us. Their patriotism encouraged our work mood.

In addition to performing in Japan, the delegation also watched various programs such as Japanese classical drama art, drama, film, and girls' singing and dancing. Many Peking Opera actors seriously studied more than a dozen excellent programs in Japanese classical drama dances such as "Noh," "Kyogen," "Kabuki," "Kyo-mai," "Nishizaki-mai," and "Gagaku" from Japanese artists. Our Peking Opera actors deeply fell in love with Japanese classical art. During their stay in Japan, they practiced tirelessly on the road, in hotels, and even in the backstage of Peking Opera performances. After returning to China, they have not interrupted. The delegation also brought back several sets of Japanese costumes from Japan, and will perform for everyone when they have the opportunity!

This time I went to Japan is a reunion in the old place, and I feel very kind and happy to reunite with old friends and meet new acquaintances. Some Japanese friends who used to accompany me on tours have passed away. I feel very sorry that I cannot relive the old friendship with them. However, this time I met more new friends. I am very touched by the care and hospitality of these new friends. This time I watched many dances with a long history in Japan. I think that the Japanese people attach great importance to their national heritage. However, due to the great changes in the social environment, their work in sorting out, improving, and developing has been restricted. Today, there are more tall buildings in Japan than before, and the number of cinemas has also increased several times. Unfortunately, the number of theaters has decreased compared to the past. Take the famous theater where I used to perform, the Imperial Theater, for example, it has now been converted into a cinema. There are more than 1,000 cinemas in Tokyo, but there are only three theaters that perform classical dramas. Japanese friends said that Tokyo will build a national theater within five years, with a directly affiliated theater troupe, and with affiliated drama schools, drama museums, etc., which has been included in the Japanese national budget. How happy I am for my friends in the Japanese art circles!

Now, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe has completed its performance mission and returned. Through this cultural exchange activity, the people of China and Japan can gain a further understanding of each other. As Japanese friends said, the hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people are closely linked together. The friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries are in line with the interests of the people of the two countries and are also necessary for the cause of world peace. This kind of friendly exchange will definitely become more frequent in the future. Then, the sincere friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will be further consolidated and developed.

    中日两国人民的深厚友谊
    梅兰芳
    中国访日京剧代表团受我国人民的委托，到邻邦日本进行了访问演出；把我国古典戏剧艺术向日本人民作了介绍，并且转达了我国人民对日本人民的问候和最好的愿望，受到日本人民的热烈欢迎。现在，代表团带着日本人民对我国人民的深情厚意回到了祖国。记得在七月十六日代表团在东京举行的告别宴会上，我对到会的日本各界友人说：“今天，中日两国人民的友谊不是泛泛的，而是真诚深厚的，中日两国人民的心也和两国的地理一样是靠近的。我们回国以后，一定珍重地把日本人民对中国人民深厚的友情传达给全中国人民。”那时，全场七百多人——日本人、旅日侨胞和代表团的人员听了这话，都报以热烈的鼓掌。一阵比一阵响亮的掌声继续了好久。真的，两国人民的心交流在一起了。现在，我怀着激动而愉快的心情，向大家讲一讲代表团在日本进行访问演出的情形。
    中国访日京剧代表团应日本朝日新闻社的邀请，在今年五月十六日由北京出发前往日本。从五月三十日起到七月十二日止，代表团在东京、福冈、八幡、名古屋、京都、大阪等城市，前后共演出三十二场，观众达七万多人（最后两场是为了救济日本战争中的孤儿和原子弹受害者而举行的义演；并且减低票价，使近万的一般群众也得到了看戏的机会）。在日本全国各地通过电视观赏了京剧演出的约有一千万人。
    代表团还和日本文化艺术界等各方面的人士进行了广泛的接触。我们在日本各城市和日本传统艺术界、话剧界、学术界、妇女和学生团体等，举行了多次座谈和学术讲话，把我国京剧改革工作和话剧运动的情况向他们作了口头的介绍。此外，我们还和旅日侨胞见了面，进行了亲切的交谈。
    代表团所到之处，都受到日本各界的热烈欢迎。在东京，以日本文艺界为中心的全国各阶层一百五十多位著名人士，组成了欢迎京剧团的委员会。日本国会众议院副议长杉山元治郎，在日本国会厦接待了代表团的领导人员和著名京剧演员，并且举行了招待茶会。这是日本国会第一次接待外国戏剧代表。在其他各城市，也都有欢迎京剧团的组织。各地方的议会和政府的负责人如议长、府知事、县知事和市长等，都曾出面欢迎中国京剧代表团。各地旅日侨胞们也欢欣鼓舞地参加了欢迎代表团的行列。
    代表团在日本各地演出，吸引了千百万的观众。许多人要排队买票站上好几个钟头，也有不少不远千里赶来看戏的，在剧院里，不论男女老少都看得那么出神。他们对每一个节目都感到极大的兴趣。演到精彩之处，台下就叫好，热烈鼓掌。这种欢乐的气氛，使我们在台上忘记了是在国外演出。在剧院外面，人们也普遍地对这次京剧代表团到日本演出，发生极大兴趣，给予好评。日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎在一次宴会上说，他在日本各地到处听到了对京剧的赞扬。日本松竹会社社长大谷竹次郎说：“我从事戏剧事业六十年了，从没见过任何一个剧团有你们这样的轰动。这一次京剧在日本的演出，出现了日本舞台上六十年来空前未有的盛况！”我想再举出一个事实作为补充。七月十日晚上，代表团在东京举行闭幕演出后还要举行闭幕仪式。这种作法在日本是少见的。当时有的日本朋友很担心：“时间那么晚，看戏的人都疲倦了，他们还对闭幕式感到兴趣吗？”的确，这种担心是有道理的：观众不是我们请去的，是自己花钱买票去看戏的。他们什么时候都可以随便走开，这是没有任何约束的。但是在闭幕式按原定计划进行的时候，近三千名的观众连许多少年儿童在内，都安静地坐着不动。他们的喜悦目光都集中在舞台上，静听日本方面的代表和京剧团代表的讲话，并且热烈鼓掌。在日本各社会团体和旅日华侨向代表团献花、赠送礼品时，台下的掌声更加响亮了。最后，全场观众振臂三呼“中日友好万岁！”
    为什么这次京剧代表团在日本演出能得到这样大的成功呢？
    在1919年和1924年，我曾两次到日本演出。那时，我们的国家处在贫弱无力和帝国主义的欺压之下，中国人是被人家看不起的。我到日本演出，一切资金和组织、联系等，只是靠我个人的努力以及少数日本朋友的帮助，才获得一些成就。那时我们的艺术虽然是日本人民所欢迎的，但和今天的情况比却显著不同。现在我们的国家独立了，走上了富强的道路。几年来，站起来的六万万中国人民，在东方，在世界上，对人类和平事业作出了不少有益的事情。我国的国际地位是空前地提高了。这是我们在国外演出受到欢迎的最基本的原因。对日本来说，我国政府和人民对日本人民的深切同情和关怀，在中日关系上所表示出的真诚而宽厚的友好态度，使日本人民受到极大的感动。因而日本人民都愿意和中国人民交朋友。这次他们称京剧团为和平友好使节。代表团所到之处，日本人都热情地喊“日中友好万岁！”欢唱“东京—北京”的歌子。京都市长高山义三在欢迎京剧代表团的会上说：“在世界上，没有东方就没有世界；在东方，没有中国就没有日本。”他还说：“有人把外交看作是戴白手套的外交官加上佩战刀的军人，那是荒谬！真正的外交，是人民的心的交流，从这里达到文化、经济和政治的交流。”日本人民就是以这样的心情热烈地接待了中国访日京剧代表团。
    精炼优美而富于表现力的京剧艺术，陶醉了日本的观众。尤其是经过改革的京剧所表现出的高度集体主义精神，和统一完整而生动和谐的艺术形象，得到了日本观众一致的赞美。日本观众有这样的反映：京剧艺术是古老的艺术，但是新中国的京剧却充满了青春的气息。
    这次代表团的每一个演员都本着集体主义的精神，去完成一个戏所给予的任务。不管是一个兵士或者是一个宫女，在一出戏的最高目的下，都能恰如其分地发挥他的作用。日本戏剧界人士认为，“新中国的京剧最显著的特点就是舞台形象高度的统一”，他们说这是很难作到的。这次在日本演出的每一个节目，都有不同的色彩和不同的情调，剧中每一个角色都有独到之处，而且每个节目都经过整理，力求剧情明确，艺术完整。这就使得每场演出，观众始终精神焕发，看戏情绪一直上升。最初有不少观众担心看不懂京剧，只是怀着好奇心走进了剧场，但在看了之后都觉得话虽然听不懂，而剧情还能理解，并且越看越有兴趣。有一位名叫小谷刚的小说作家，他起先认为大家对京剧的赞美是“乱捧”，于是他抱着专挑毛病的成见去看戏。结果，他被感动得流了泪。第二天，他还在报纸上发表文章，对京剧艺术赞美不绝。
    这次我们在日本演出所以获得这样的成功，还应该感谢日本友人和爱国侨胞们的热情关怀和大力帮助。朝日新闻社、各地欢迎委员会及各界著名人士，都给京剧代表团以殷勤的接待和许多具体帮助。市川猿之助派出了他的剧团后台经理和舞台工作各方面的负责人，千田是也派出了俳优座的舞台监督，前进座也派了一位演员和一位导演来协助我们工作。这种兄弟般的友谊使我们深受感动。旅居日本各地的爱国侨胞们拿出了全部的力量，对我们照顾得无微不至。许多侨胞不顾风吹雨淋太阳晒，始终不懈地帮助代表团工作。有时我们请他们休息一下，他们则说：你们为祖国工作，我们为你们工作也就是为祖国工作；代表团为祖国争得的光荣，也有我们一份。他们这种爱国主义精神鼓舞了我们的工作情绪。
    代表团在日本演出之外，还观摩了日本的古典戏剧艺术和话剧、电影、少女歌舞等多种节目。不少京剧演员认真地向日本艺术家学习了“能”、“狂言”、“歌舞伎”、“京舞”、“西崎舞”、“雅乐”等日本古典戏剧舞蹈中的十多个优秀节目。我们的京剧演员深深地爱上了日本的古典艺术。在日本期间，他们在旅途上，在饭店里，甚至在京剧演出的后台，不知疲倦地进行了练习。回国之后，他们也没有间断过。代表团还从日本带回了几套日本戏装，将来有机会还要演给大家看呢！
    我这次到日本是旧地重游，和旧遇新知欢聚，倍感亲切和愉快。过去有些曾经陪我游览的日本友人有的已经去世了。我不能和他们重温旧日的友情，感到十分遗憾。但是，这次我又结识了更多的新朋友。这些新朋友对我们的关怀和招待，使我非常感动。这次我在日本观赏了许多有悠久历史的舞蹈。我想，日本人民是非常重视他们自己的民族遗产的。但是由于社会环境变动很大，他们在整理、改进和发展的工作上受到了限制。现今日本的高大楼房比从前多了，电影院也增加了好几倍。可惜剧院却比过去减少了。就拿我当年曾经在那里演出过的一个著名剧场——帝国剧场来说，现在也已经改成电影院。在东京有一千多家电影院，而演古典戏剧的剧场却只有三个。听日本友人说：东京将在五年内建造一座国家剧场，有直属剧团，并有附设戏剧学校、戏剧博物馆等，这已经列入日本的国家预算。我是多么为日本艺术界的朋友高兴啊！
    现在，中国访日京剧代表团已经完成演出任务回来了。通过这次文化交流活动，中日两国人民当可获得进一步的相互了解。正如日本朋友所说，中日两国人民的心和心紧紧地连结在一起了。两国人民的友好往来是符合两国人民的利益的，也是世界和平事业所必须的。这种友好往来，今后一定会更加频繁起来。那么，中日两国人民的真挚的友谊必将进一步地得到巩固和发展。（附图片）
