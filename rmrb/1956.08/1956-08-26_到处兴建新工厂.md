    Anshan Iron and Steel Builds the Second Medium Plate Plant
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Medium Plate Plant, which began construction in June this year, has already begun pouring concrete foundations.
    In June, a construction team arrived at the construction site of the Second Medium Plate Plant. In the old medium plate plant, which was severely damaged more than a decade ago, they began dismantling the old foundations and clearing garbage. Now the demolition and clearing work has been largely completed, the plant buildings have been partially reinforced, and the construction project has officially started.
    The various medium-sized steel plates produced by the Second Medium Plate Plant in the future will be much better than those produced by the old medium plate plant in terms of length, width, thickness, and quality. This large-sized steel plate is urgently needed by China's shipbuilding industry, automobile industry, and tractor industry. This steel plate can also be used to build giant factories, railway bridges, crane frames and crane beams, as well as steam boilers, locomotives, train carriages, oil tanks, gas towers, gas pipelines, and agricultural implements.
    After this plant is put into production, the output of medium-sized steel plates will be more than double the steel plate production of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1955.
    This factory was designed by the designers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Office, and the main equipment is also manufactured by the relevant factories of Anshan Iron and Steel.
    The factory building is spacious and has automated loading equipment and some ventilation devices, and the working conditions are better than the old medium plate plant.

    A Large Hydropower Station on the Shangyou River
    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: A large-scale hydroelectric power station is being built on the Shangyou River in southern Jiangxi Province, which is very rich in water resources.
    Now, the first dry season concrete project of this hydropower station has been completed according to the original plan. The concrete of the dam body of the barrage has been poured out of the water surface, and the vault of the internal plant building on the left bank has been sealed. It is expected that by the end of this year, the concrete of the dam will be poured to the top of the spillway section. In early next year, the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment can be officially carried out at this hydropower station.
    The Shangyou River Hydropower Station started construction in March 1955. Its dam site is located at Tieshanguan in Shangyou County. Because the cliffs on both sides of the canyon area are steep and the river surface is narrow, the designers adopted a novel in-dam plant-style project layout. The in-dam plant building is as high as thirty-two meters, and the hydraulic turbine generators will all be installed in the huge concrete dam body, without the need to build a separate power plant building. Therefore, the cost of the entire hydropower station is relatively low, and the average investment in each kilowatt of power generation equipment is not much different from thermal power generation.
    This hydropower station was designed by Chinese technicians under the guidance of Soviet experts. Since the in-dam plant-style hydropower station is being built for the first time in China, and there are few in the world, the designers boldly adopted many new technologies in the design process.

    Shanghai Adds Power Plants
    This newspaper reports: Part of a large thermal power plant - the Wangting Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration has begun construction.
    Comrade Ke Qingshi mentioned in his report to the Fourth Session of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China that, in order to fully guarantee the electricity demand required for Shanghai's industrial growth, we should strive to rapidly expand the Jiangsu Wangting Thermal Power Plant and erect a high-voltage transmission line between the Zhejiang Xin'an River Hydropower Station and Shanghai to combine them into a power grid in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou triangle area.
    The vast majority of the design drawings and equipment such as boilers, turbines, and electrical equipment for the Wangting Thermal Power Plant are provided by Czechoslovakia, and the degree of automation is very high. It is estimated that after the completion of the first phase of the project in the second quarter of 1958, the power supply capacity will be more than three times that of the Qishuyan Power Plant.
    Wangting is located on the Shanghai-Nanjing line between Suzhou and Wuxi, straddling the canal and leaning against Lihu Lake in the west. It has convenient transportation and abundant water sources, and has many favorable conditions for the development of the power industry. After it was decided to build a station here in December last year, tense preparations for the construction of the factory began immediately. Now, the preparations are largely in place. The special railway line directly to the construction site of the plant has been completed, and various construction materials and mechanical equipment can be directly transported to the site. Temporary buildings for construction, such as offices, warehouses, and processing plants, have been completed, covering more than 12,000 square meters. Eight staff dormitories for employees will also be completed by the end of this month. Currently, we are actively preparing various building materials, allocating labor forces, training new workers, establishing and rectifying organizations, and striving to start comprehensive construction as soon as possible.

    Modern Tractor Repair and Assembly Plant
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: A modern tractor repair and assembly plant has begun construction in Zhengzhou. The entire project of this factory will be carried out in three phases, and the entire project will be completed in 1959. The main plant building of the first phase of the project, which is currently underway, is expected to be completed by the end of this year. After the completion of the first phase of the project, this factory can repair 400 standard tractor units per year.
    At present, there are more than 800 standard tractor units in state-owned farms and agricultural tractor stations in Henan Province. Since there has never been a decent repair and assembly plant, broken tractors often have to be loaded onto trains and transported to Beijing, Jinan, Bengbu and other places for repairs. Moreover, because these tractors come from seven countries and have sixteen brands, it is difficult to buy broken parts, and several units have stopped working as a result. After this factory is partially put into production by the end of this year, this situation will be greatly changed, and the repair cost is expected to be reduced by about 20% compared to the past.
    The plant building is designed according to the latest Soviet drawings, with heating, ventilation, lighting, upper and lower drainage channels, and upper and lower lifting equipment, as well as male and female bathrooms and changing rooms. It is very comfortable for workers to work in the factory.
    After this modern tractor repair and assembly plant is fully put into production in 1960, its main task will be to manufacture and repair the repair tools for all the regional tractor repair and assembly plants in Henan Province, and will undertake the task of manufacturing precision parts for agricultural machinery in the province.

    Automated Asbestos Beneficiation Plant
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd: Sichuan State-owned Asbestos Mine is building a new automated beneficiation plant. It is currently the largest and most modern asbestos beneficiation plant in China.
    This asbestos beneficiation plant was designed by Czechoslovak expert Feng Jia leading the engineering and technical personnel of the mine. The production process of this factory, from drying, crushing, screening to the production of finished asbestos products, is automated. The entire production process only requires nine workers to manage.
    Now, most of the machines and equipment manufactured in Sichuan according to the design have been completed and are being installed.

    A Large Dairy Factory on the Grassland
    Xinhua News Agency, Hailar: A large-scale modern dairy factory is being built on the east bank of the Yimin River in Hailar City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This factory started construction in late last month, and the foundation project of the main plant has now been completed.
    This dairy factory mainly produces lactose, acid gum, and cream to meet the needs of the domestic chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Acid gum will also be exported.
    After the factory is completed, it will be the largest of the existing and under-construction dairy factories in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Its production capacity can handle up to about 100 tons of milk per day, and the annual output of dairy products can reach more than 1,400 tons. The main machinery and equipment of this factory are all modern. From processing fresh milk to producing finished products and packaging, all operations will be done by machines. In order to maintain the acidity of fresh milk, the factory will also use refrigerated trucks in the summer to purchase milk from state-owned farms and herdsmen on the grasslands around Hailar City for 70-80 kilometers.
    This factory is expected to be put into production in May next year.

    Flour Mill under the Altai Mountains
    Xinhua News Agency, Yining: A modern flour mill with a daily output of 35,000 kilograms of flour is being built in Altay County under the Altai Mountains in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The civil construction project of the flour mill will be completed by the end of September, and it will be officially put into production in the first quarter of next year.
    In the past, the flour needed by the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups here was only processed and supplied by more than a dozen crudely constructed water mills distributed in the county. After the river freezes every winter, many water mills cannot turn for three or four months. Part of the required flour had to be transported by car from Urumqi City, which is six or seven days away. After this flour mill is completed, the flour produced will be fully supplied to people of all ethnic groups.

    到处兴建新工厂
    鞍钢建设第二中板厂
    据新华社讯　鞍钢在今年六月间动工建设的第二中板厂，现在已经开始浇灌混凝土基础。
    六月间，一支建筑工程队来到了第二中板厂的工地。他们在十几年前遭受严重破坏的旧中板厂里，开始拆除旧的基础，清除垃圾。现在这些拆除、清除工作已经大体结束，厂房也进行了部分的加固，建设工程正式开始施工了。
    第二中板厂将来生产的各种中型钢板，比旧中板厂生产的钢板，不论在长度、宽度、厚度和质量方面都要好得多。这种大规格的钢板是目前中国造船工业、汽车和拖拉机等工业所迫切需要的。这种钢板还可以用作建筑巨型的厂房、铁路桥梁、大吊车的车架和吊车梁，也可以制造蒸汽锅炉、火车头、火车车厢、石油罐、煤气塔、煤气管道以及农具等。
    这个厂投入生产以后，中型钢板的产量将比鞍钢1955年生产的钢板还要多一倍以上。
    这座工厂是由鞍钢设计处的设计师们设计出来的，主要设备也是由鞍钢有关工厂来制造。
    这座工厂的厂房宽敞，还有自动化的装料设备和一些通风装置，劳动条件比旧中板厂好。
    上犹江上的大型水电站
    新华社23日讯　江西省南部水力资源非常丰富的上犹江上，正在建设一个大型的水力发电站。
    现在，这个水电站的第一个枯水季节的混凝土工程，已经按照原定计划完成了。拦河坝的坝体混凝土浇出水面，靠左岸坝内厂房的拱顶已经封好。预计到今年年底，大坝的混凝土将浇到溢流部分的顶部。明年年初，这个水电站就可以正式进行机电设备的安装工作了。
    上犹江水电站是1955年3月开始建设的，它的坝址在上犹县的铁扇关，由于峡谷区两岸崖壁陡峭，河面狭窄，设计人员采用了形式新颖的坝内厂房式工程布置。坝内厂房高达三十二公尺，水轮发电机将全部安装在庞大的混凝土坝体内，不必另外建造发电厂房。因而，整个水电站的造价比较低，平均每瓩发电设备的投资和火力发电相差不远。
    这个水电站是在苏联专家指导下，由我国技术人员自己设计的。由于坝内厂房式的水电站在我国还是第一次兴建，世界上也为数不多，因此设计人员在设计过程中，曾经大胆地采用了许多新技术。
    上海增建发电站
    本报讯　一座大型的火力发电站——上海电业管理局望亭发电站部分工程已经开始施工。
    柯庆施同志代表中共上海市委在上海市人民代表大会第四次会议上所作的报告中曾经提到，为了充分保证上海工业增长所需要的用电量，争取把江苏望亭火力发电站迅速扩建起来，并架设浙江新安江水力发电站和上海之间的高压输电线，使之结合成为沪宁杭三角地带的电力网。
    望亭火力发电站绝大部分的设计图纸和锅炉、汽机、电气等设备，都是由捷克斯洛伐克供给，自动化程度很高。预计第一期工程在1958年第二季度完工后，供电能力就要比戚墅堰电厂大三倍以上。
    望亭位于沪宁线上苏州和无锡之间，跨越运河，西靠蠡湖，交通便利，水源充足，对发展电力工业有很多有利条件。去年十二月份确定在这里建站后，随即开始了紧张的建厂筹备工作。现在，筹备工作大致就绪，直达厂房施工点的专用线铁路已经建成，各种建筑器材和机械设备可直接运到工地；供施工用的办公室、仓库、加工厂等临时建筑已经完成一万二千多平方公尺；供职工居住的八幢职工宿舍也将在本月底完工。目前正积极准备各种建筑器材，调配劳动力量，培训新工人，建立和整顿组织，争取早日全面施工。　（解放日报）
    现代 化的拖拉机修配厂
    新华社郑州电　一座现代化的拖拉机修配厂开始在郑州动工兴建。这个工厂的全部工程分三期进行，整个工程将在1959年建成。目前正在进行的第一期工程的主厂房，预计在今年年底建成。第一期工程完成以后，这个工厂每年就可以修理四百个标准台拖拉机。
    目前河南省国营农场和农业拖拉机站，已有八百多个标准台拖拉机，由于从来没有一个像样的修配厂，往往要把坏了的拖拉机装上火车，运往北京、济南、蚌埠等地修理；又因这些拖拉机来自七个国家，有十六种牌号，坏了零件不好购买，已经有数台因此停止了工作。今年年底这个厂部分投入生产后，这种情况将大大改变，修理成本预计也要比过去降低20％左右。
    这个厂房是按照苏联最新图纸设计的，室内有暖气、通风、照明、上下排水道、上下起重设备，还有男女浴室、更衣室等。工人在厂内工作，非常舒适。
    这个现代化的拖拉机修配厂到1960年全部投入生产后，它的主要任务将是制造和修理河南省所有区间拖拉机修配厂的修理工具，并且将担负起全省农业机械精密零件的制造任务。
    自动化的石棉精选厂
    新华社成都23日电　四川国营石棉矿正在新建一座自动化精选厂。它是中国目前最大和最新式的一座石棉精选厂。
    这座石棉精选厂是由捷克斯洛伐克专家冯加领导着这个矿的工程技术人员设计的。这个厂的生产过程从干燥、粉碎、筛选到石棉成品生产出来，都是自动化的，整个生产过程只要九个工人管理。
    现在，按照设计在四川制造的全部机器设备，绝大部分已经做好，正在安装中。
    草原上的大型乳品厂
    新华社海拉尔电　在内蒙古自治区海拉尔市内伊敏河东畔，正在兴建一座大型现代化的乳品工厂。这座工厂是在上月下旬动工兴建的，现在已经完成了主要厂房的基础工程。
    这座乳品工厂主要生产乳糖、酸胶和奶油，供应国内化学、医药工业和食品业的需要，其中酸胶还将出口。
    这座工厂建成以后，将是内蒙古自治区现有的和正在兴建的乳品工厂中规模最大的一个。它的生产能力，每天最多能处理牛奶一百吨左右，一年出产乳制品最多可以达到一千四百多吨。这个厂的主要机器设备全部是现代化的。从处理鲜牛奶到生产成品以及包装，都将用机器操作。为了保持鲜牛奶酸度，这个厂在夏天还将使用冷藏汽车，在海拉尔市周围七、八十公里的草原上向各国营牧场和牧民收购牛奶。
    这座工厂预计在明年五月份投入生产。
    阿尔泰山下的面粉厂
    新华社伊宁电　新疆维吾尔自治区阿尔泰山下阿勒泰县正在修建一座日产三万五千公斤面粉的现代化面粉厂。面粉厂的土木建筑工程到九月底可完工，明年第一季度正式投入生产。
    过去这里的各族农牧民需用的面粉，只是依靠分布在县内的十几盘构造粗糙的水磨来加工供应。每年冬季河水封冻后，不少水磨三四个月无法转动。所需的一部分面粉还得靠汽车从六七天路程以外的乌鲁木齐市运来。这座面粉厂建成后，生产出的面粉将向各族人民充分供应。
