    The Wooden Handle on the Lid of the Spittoon
    Mu Chen
    Whenever I see the wooden handle on the lid of a spittoon in a meeting place or elsewhere, I can't help but ask myself: Why put a lid on the spittoon?
    Some measures, on the surface, seem very good, but after careful thought, they are not appropriate. The issue of covering spittoons is worth careful study.
    Why have spittoons? To prevent people from spitting and blowing their noses on the ground, thus spreading disease. But the result of covering the spittoon contradicts the purpose of having spittoons. The spittoon cuts off the route of disease transmission, but the wooden handle on the spittoon lid opens up a new route for disease transmission.
    Is the purpose of covering the spittoon to prevent microorganisms from flying out of the spittoon? Of course not. Because there is water in the spittoon, microorganisms will not fly out. The intention of covering the spittoon must be: first, to cover up the dirty things inside the spittoon to avoid obstructing the view; second, to prevent flies from crawling around on the spittoon. But in fact, covering the spittoon does not solve these two problems. Some covered spittoons are often not washed for several days, and covering them only hides the dirt inside, and flies still crawl around on the spittoon.
    But the most important issue is the wooden handle on the spittoon lid. How do people use covered spittoons? First, they use their hands to open the spittoon lid and put it on the ground, then they use their hands to blow their noses, and then they use their hands, already contaminated with nasal mucus, to put the spittoon lid back in place. The dark and dirty part of the wooden handle of the spittoon lid that we often see is the result of being contaminated countless times by people's oral and nasal secretions. Isn't such a wooden handle a medium for spreading disease? Why don't people feel wary of this wooden handle? Of course, if a regulation is made to let people only use one hand to lift the lid and the other hand to blow their nose, that might be good, but it will certainly not work.
    Setting up spittoons is still necessary now, but covering them is superfluous. It should be advocated to wash the spittoons clean every day, and add some disinfectant to the spittoon when conditions permit.

    痰盂盖上的木把
    穆晨
    我每当在会场里或是其他地方，看到痰盂盖上面那一根木把的时候，就不禁自问：为什么痰盂要加盖呢？
    有些办法，从表面看，似乎很好，但经过仔细一想，却并不合适。关于痰盂加盖问题，就很有仔细研究的必要。
    为什么设痰盂？为了避免有人随地擤鼻涕吐痰，以致传播疾病。但是痰盂加盖的结果，却与设痰盂的目的，有了矛盾。痰盂切断了疾病传播的路线，可是痰盂盖的木把却开辟了疾病传播的一条新的路线。
    痰盂加盖的目的是为了防止微生物从痰盂里飞跑出来吗？当然不是。因为痰盂里有水，微生物不会飞跑出来。痰盂加盖的用意一定是在于：第一，把痰盂里面的脏东西遮盖起来，免碍观瞻；第二，免得苍蝇在痰盂边上爬来爬去。可是事实上，痰盂加盖之后，并没有解决这两个问题。有些加盖的痰盂，往往几天不洗，加盖不过是掩盖了痰盂里面的肮脏，苍蝇依然在痰盂边上爬来爬去。
    但最重要的问题还在于痰盂盖上面那根木把。人们是怎样使用加盖的痰盂的呢？先用手把痰盂盖揭开，放在地上，然后用手擤鼻涕，再用已经沾染了鼻涕的手把痰盂盖放还原位。我们经常看到的痰盂盖木把上面污黑的那一段，就是被人们的口腔鼻腔排泄物沾染了不知多少次的结果。这样一根木把不正是一个传染疾病的媒介吗？人们为什么不对这根木把发生戒备之心呢？当然，如果做一个规定，让人们只能以一手提盖，另一手擤鼻涕，那也许是很好的，但那一定是行不通的。
    设痰盂现在还是必要的，加盖则是多余。应该提倡每天把痰盂刷洗干净，在条件可能的情况下，痰盂里面加些消毒的药水。
