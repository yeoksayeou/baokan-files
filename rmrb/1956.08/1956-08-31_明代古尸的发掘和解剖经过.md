Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 30th: Five Ming Dynasty corpses were excavated in Nantong and Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, in February and May-June of this year. They were buried underground for three to four hundred years without decaying, a fact that has aroused widespread interest both domestically and abroad.

The first striking phenomenon after these corpses were unearthed was the rapid change in skin color and the color of the water in the coffins. The skin of the female corpse Peng Shujie, buried in the 33rd year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty (402 years ago), was originally stone blue. Half an hour after the coffin was opened, her complexion turned grayish, and the next day it became dark gray. During the dissection of this corpse, the cut muscle appeared light red, but quickly turned grayish-red. The water in Peng Shujie's coffin was originally light yellow, but quickly turned green after the coffin was opened, and the next day it turned dark gray. Interestingly, the colors of this coffin water and the corpse's muscles did not change in an air-isolated environment.

Three of the five corpses were dissected. During the dissection, it was found that the corpses of Gu Neng and Sheng Yi were relatively dry (Gu Neng's corpse weighed only 15 kilograms, and Sheng Yi's corpse weighed 17.5 kilograms), and their internal organs were atrophied. Peng Shujie's female corpse was very plump, weighing 30.7 kilograms, and obese. X-ray examination revealed a layer of fat, and the internal organs were similar to those of a normal person.

The epidermis of these three corpses was covered with oily substances or many waxy nodules. A brown oily substance found in Sheng Yi's chest cavity could even be burned.

Experts observed and studied the cells of the corpses. The epidermis of Gu Neng's skin was detached, the subcutaneous connective tissue was intact, the elastic fibers of the blood vessel walls were normal, and the striated muscle fibers were intact but without striations or nuclei. Cartilage cells were present, and the cell nuclei could be seen in most of them. Sheng Yi's cartilage, upon examination, had cells but no nuclei. Cartilage cell cultures were performed on Peng Shujie's elbow joint cartilage, but no cell growth was observed. Examination of rib cartilage sections revealed cells and nuclei, with clear outlines of the nuclei, but the contents of the nuclei were blurred. Experts said that whether these were true nuclei remains to be further proven. As for the cells in the internal organs of the corpses, they were not clear. Peng Shujie's bone tissue could be sectioned without decalcification. What attracted people's attention was that two willow branches, about a foot long, found in Peng Shujie's coffin, had leaves that looked as fresh as newly picked ones. Microscopic observation revealed cells, and cells resembling chlorophyll granules could be seen in the palisade tissue cells within the peeled samples.

Many people had previously believed that the water in the coffins of Sheng Yi and Peng Shujie might have been artificially added preservatives, but the experts' observations negated this assumption. According to examination, the coffins were filled inside and out with sanhetu (a mixture of glutinous rice juice, sand, gravel, and lime; although this sanhetu is similar to modern concrete, it is less hard and water can penetrate it), or a large amount of rosin. Some coffins were also filled with dry loose cotton and a large amount of rush that could absorb moisture. This all indicates that the purpose was to prevent water from entering the coffin. Moreover, the coffin water was acidic (PH 5.3) and contained hydrogen sulfide, fatty acids, cadaverine, calcium, and magnesium. Although the coffin water originally contained no bacteria, experimental results showed that various bacteria could grow in the coffin water.

The coffins containing these corpses were all made of valuable wood such as Phoebe nanmu. The coffins generally had two layers, and a large amount of sanhetu and rosin were filled outside the coffins and between the two layers to ensure airtightness. Experts believe that the airtightness of the coffins played an important role in preserving these corpses for three to four hundred years.

### 明代古尸的发掘和解剖经过

    明代古尸的发掘和解剖经过
    据新华社南京30日电　今年二月和五、六月间在江苏省南通和扬州先后发掘出五具明代古尸，它们埋葬在地下三、四百年没有腐烂，这件事引起了国内外人士普遍的兴趣。
    这些古尸出土以后第一个引人注意的现象，是尸体肤色和棺中存水的颜色迅速变化。明嘉靖三十三年（距离现在四百零二年）埋葬的彭淑洁女尸的皮肤原是石青色，开棺后半小时，脸色就变灰暗，第二天变成了深灰色，这个尸体在解剖时，切开肌肉呈淡红色，但迅速变为灰红色。彭淑洁棺中的水原是淡黄色，开棺后迅速变成绿色，第二天转成深灰色。有趣的是，在隔绝空气的环境中，这种棺水和尸体肌肉的颜色都不变化。
    五具尸体中有三具作了解剖，在解剖过程中，发现顾能和盛仪的尸体比较干枯（顾能尸体仅重十五公斤，盛仪尸体重十七点五公斤），内脏萎缩；彭淑洁女尸很丰满，它重三十点七公斤，肥胖，用爱克斯光透射，还可见脂肪层，内脏同正常人相似。
    这三具尸体的表皮上都附有油脂状物或多数腊样结节，在盛仪胸腔中发现的褐色油状物还可以燃烧。
    专家们观察和研究了尸体的细胞。顾能皮肤的表皮脱失，皮下结缔组织完整，血管壁的弹性纤维正常，横纹肌纤维完整，但无横纹及核；软骨细胞存在，大部分可以看见细胞核。盛仪的软骨，经检查有细胞但无核。对彭淑洁的肘关节软骨曾作软骨细胞培养，不见有细胞生长，检查肋软骨切片，见有细胞和细胞核，核的轮廓明显，但核的内容模糊，专家们说，这是否真正的细胞核，尚待进一步证明。至于尸体内脏组织的细胞都看不清楚。彭淑洁的骨组织不经脱灰就可以切片。引起人们注意的是，在彭淑洁棺中发现的长约一尺左右的两根柳枝，枝叶颜色像新摘下的那样，用显微镜观察可以看见细胞，在撕片内栅状组织的细胞内还有类似叶绿素颗粒。
    曾有许多人认为盛仪和彭淑洁棺中的水可能是人工放进的防腐剂，专家们的观察否定了这种设想。据检查，在这些棺内外填塞有三合土（用糯米汁合砂石子，再用石灰搅拌而成，这种三合土虽似现在的混凝土，但硬度差，水可以浸进去），或大量松香，有的在棺中还装填干松的棉花和大量可以吸湿气的灯心草，这都说明是为了防止水侵入棺内。而且，棺水呈酸性（PH5．3），含硫化氢和脂肪酸、尸胺、钙、镁。棺水中原来虽然没有细菌，但试验结果证明，各种细菌都可以在棺水中生长。
    盛置这些尸体的棺椁都是用贵重的楠木等木材制成的，棺一般有两层，在棺外以及两层棺木之间填塞有大量三合土和松香，以保证密闭。专家们认为，这些尸体能保有三、四百年，棺的密闭程度起了重要的作用。
