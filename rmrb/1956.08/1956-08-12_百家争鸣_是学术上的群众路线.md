    "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the Mass Line in Academia
    Tang Yongtong
    As Chairman Mao predicted, with the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear. The policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is a necessary and timely mobilization order for launching a high tide of cultural construction.
    The entire history of the victorious development of the Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the Party eloquently proves that the mass line, based on Marxist epistemology, is the primary condition for doing all work well. To accomplish the great historical task of enabling our country's important scientific departments to catch up with the world's advanced levels within twelve years, it is necessary to more extensively and profoundly implement the mass line, which makes us invincible, in scientific work. The policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" can ensure the elimination of the idea of personal worship in the academic field, further and more effectively promote democracy, maximize the creative spirit of the people, and thus guarantee the further implementation of the mass line in the academic field.
    The proposal of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" has inspired academic workers.
    For thousands of years, no class or group in history has ever proposed such a policy, nor could they have. The spontaneous phenomenon of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was instead vigorously suppressed and destroyed by successive rulers. Qin Shi Huang's "burning books and burying scholars" and Emperor Wu of Han's "dismissal of all schools of thought," establishing Confucianism as the sole dominant ideology, are obvious examples of stifling "letting a hundred schools of thought contend."
    Only under the proletarian-led regime is it possible to propose the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" for the first time in history. This is because the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat is the dictatorship of the vast majority of the people over a very small number of exploiters. The people do not need to trap their thoughts in any fixed form to the point of stagnation and degeneration. "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" encourages the people to seek truth and gives the people's minds new vitality every day. Only the proletariat's philosophy—dialectical materialism—can theoretically arrive at the conclusion of advocating "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" for the first time. This is because the epistemology of dialectical materialism is to concentrate the opinions of the masses and then persist in them among the masses. It is inherently collectivist and ultimately aims at defending the interests of the masses. Marxism-Leninism is the constantly developing and creative truth. The proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is itself a great victory for Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" will never weaken Marxism-Leninism, but on the contrary, will make the truth of Marxism-Leninism clearer and more creatively and profoundly implemented in every academic field.
    The "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" that we are now advocating is fundamentally different from the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in ancient times, and it is also different from the "tolerance" advocated by Mr. Cai Yuanpei, which played a progressive role. The current "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" first and foremost serves a great purpose, which is socialist construction, which is to rapidly improve the scientific and cultural level of the motherland. Therefore, the main spirit of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" lies in maximizing the creative ability of the people to serve socialist construction.
    Therefore, in order to implement the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in institutions of higher learning, I think we should first study how to enable everyone to work creatively. For example, the current teaching reform has entered a new stage. We should do less empty discussion about teaching plans and teaching outlines, and more serious practical investigation to truly understand whether the students we train can creatively and independently solve practical problems after graduation. In the work process, is what they have learned useful? Is it applicable? What necessary knowledge do they still lack? If they still cannot work independently, what are the reasons? After such practical investigation and research, revising the teaching plan and teaching outline will definitely be more effective and practical.
    In fact, due to the serious influence of dogmatism in the past, we have rarely paid practical attention to cultivating students' independent thinking habits and independent research capabilities in the teaching process. Many students, after graduation, not only cannot work creatively, but even cannot work independently. For example, students assigned to some research institutes still have to take refresher courses. At present, how to cultivate students' independent thinking habits and independent research capabilities is indeed an urgent issue. We must come up with concrete measures from all aspects to quickly solve this problem. If the new forces we train cannot work creatively and independently, and cannot participate in "letting a hundred schools of thought contend," then we have not truly implemented the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend."
    On the other hand, we must vigorously develop the potential of teachers to carry out scientific work so that they can make creative contributions as much as possible. This requires creating some necessary conditions.
    For example, some older academic workers have accumulated some materials and have some insights and opinions over the decades. They all hope to have several assistants in order to carry out research more effectively and contribute their strength fully to the motherland. It would be a great pity if, like the famous linguist Yang Shuda, they passed away before they could pass on all their knowledge and talent to the younger generation. Therefore, the assistant problem is an urgent problem for older academic workers.
    In addition, some old professors have indeed unique insights in certain areas after decades of research. Can we also consider allowing them to offer some elective courses to impart this specialized knowledge, giving full play to their expertise, while completing the teaching plan? I think this will not only benefit Comrade Lu Dingyi's proposal to establish schools of thought, but also enable old professors to improve through teaching.
    To enable teachers to work creatively, a large amount of books and materials is needed, but the problem of books and materials has not been completely resolved in recent years. Because Peking University does not have houses, most of the books cannot be concentrated for use. The distribution of books in various schools is also unreasonable, and many books have to be stored unused because they have not been cataloged. Can we mobilize college students to sort out these books during the summer vacation? Of course, if so, they should be paid a certain salary. As for archives and ancient artifacts, even fewer can be used. I think relevant departments should quickly solve these problems.
    At the same time, the difference between the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" we are now advocating and the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and "tolerance" in ancient times lies in the fact that the current "letting a hundred schools of thought contend," since it is to promote the spirit of creation and build socialism, cannot be done in its own way, unrelated to each other, but must unite and help each other, seek truth in full and free discussion, in order to achieve the goal of improving the level of science and culture. This requires close cooperation between various scientific and cultural departments. At present, we still have many shortcomings in this regard. For example, the cooperation between research institutions and institutions of higher learning is not close enough. We should find ways to change this situation from all aspects. For example, research institutions, which master the problems that the country needs to research, can ask institutions of higher learning to help solve them; institutions of higher learning can also seek the help of research institutions when encountering difficulties in completing their educational tasks. We are faced with the arduous task of catching up with the world's advanced scientific level in twelve years. Only by mobilizing all forces, giving them reasonable and close organization, and working together can we live up to the trust of the Party and the people.
    Due to being ill for a long time, I do not have a good understanding of the actual situation. These opinions are inevitably subjective and one-sided, but the proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" makes me feel infinitely happy and encouraged. Therefore, I said what I thought in my heart. I will work hard with all academic workers to implement the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and welcome the high tide of cultural construction in the motherland.

### “百家争鸣”是学术上的群众路线

    “百家争鸣”是学术上的群众路线
    汤用彤
    正如毛主席所曾预言的，随着经济建设高潮的到来，必然出现一个文化建设高潮。百家争鸣的方针正是掀起文化建设高潮必要而及时的动员号令。
    中国人民革命在党的领导下胜利发展的全部历史，雄辩地证实了以马克思主义认识论为理论基础的群众路线乃是做好一切工作的首要条件。为完成使我国重要科学部门在十二年内赶上世界先进水平的伟大历史任务，就必须更广泛、更深刻地在科学工作方面贯彻使我们无往而不胜的群众路线。百家争鸣方针可以保证在学术领域内肃清个人崇拜思想，更深入、更有效地发扬民主，最大限度地发挥人民群众的创造精神，也就是保证群众路线在学术领域内的进一步贯彻。
    百家争鸣的提出使学术工作者感到振奋。
    几千年来，历史上任何阶级、任何集团都没有，也不可能提出这样的方针。春秋战国时代自发的百家争鸣现象反而受到历代统治者的大力镇压和摧残。秦始皇的“焚书坑儒”，汉武帝的“罢黜百家”，以儒家“定于一尊”都是扼杀百家争鸣的明显例证。
    只有在无产阶级领导的政权之下，才有可能第一次在历史上提出百家争鸣的方针。因为无产阶级领导的人民民主专政是绝大多数人民对于极少数剥削者的专政，人民不需要把自己的思想套在什么固定的形式里以致僵化、退化。百家争鸣促使人民去寻找真理，使人民头脑每日都有新的生机。只有无产阶级的哲学——辩证唯物主义才有可能第一次从理论上得出提倡百家争鸣的结论。因为辩证唯物主义的认识论就是要将群众意见集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。它本身就是集体主义的，以捍卫群众利益为最终目的的。马克思列宁主义就是不断发展创造的真理。百家争鸣方针的提出本身就是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。因此，百家争鸣决不会削弱马克思列宁主义，而是相反地，会使马克思列宁主义的真理愈辩愈明，使马克思列宁主义更富于创造性地、更深刻地贯彻到每一学术领域中去。
    我们现在提倡的百家争鸣根本不同于古代百家争鸣，也不同于蔡元培先生所曾提倡的，起过进步作用的，“兼容并包”。现在的百家争鸣首先是服务于一个伟大的目的，这就是社会主义建设，就是迅速提高祖国科学文化水平。因此，百家争鸣的主要精神就在于最大限度地发挥人民群众的创造能力以服务于社会主义建设。
    因此，在高等学校贯彻百家争鸣方针，我认为应该首先研究如何使每一个人都能创造性地进行工作。例如目前教学改革已经进入新的阶段，应当少作一些关于教学计划和教学大纲的空洞讨论，而应多作一些认真的实际调查，切实了解一下我们培养出来的学生毕业后是不是能创造性地、独立解决实际问题？在工作过程中，他们所学的东西是不是能用？是不是适用？他们还缺少哪些必要知识？如果他们还不能独立工作，原因又是什么？经过这样的实际调查研究，再来修改教学计划，教学大纲一定会更有效、更切实。
    事实上，过去由于教条主义的严重影响，我们在教学过程中还很少切实注意培养学生的独立思考习惯和独立研究能力。有很多学生毕业后不但不能创造性地进行工作，甚至还不能独立工作。例如被分配到某些研究所的学生就还得进行补课。目前，如何培养学生独立思考习惯和独立研究能力实在是一个迫不容缓的问题。必须从各方面想出具体办法来迅速解决这一问题。如果我们培养出来的新生力量不能创造性地独立工作，不能参与百家争鸣，我们就没有真正贯彻好百家争鸣的方针。
    另一方面，必须大力发挥教员进行科学工作的潜力，使他们尽量能作出创造性的贡献。这就需要创设一些必需的条件。
    例如年纪老一些的学术工作者，几十年来积累了一些材料，也有一些见解和看法，他们都盼望能有几个助手以便更有效地开展研究，把自己的力量充分贡献给祖国。如果像著名语言文字学家杨树达先生那样，还未能把自己的知识和才学全部传授给年青一代就与世长辞了，那是十分可惜的。因此，助手问题对于年纪大一些的学术工作者来说是一个迫切问题。
    另外，有些老教授经过几十年的研究，在某些方面确有独到之处，是否也可以考虑让他们在完成教学计划的情况下开设一些选修课程以传授这些专门知识，充分发挥他们的专长呢？我想这样不但对于陆定一同志提出的成立学派有好处，而且也可以使老教授通过教学得到提高。
    要使教师们能创造性地进行工作，就需要大量的图书资料，但是图书资料也是几年来一直未彻底解决的问题。北京大学由于没有房子，大部分图书不能集中起来加以利用。各校图书分布也有不合理之处，还有许多图书由于尚未编目，只好存库不用。是否可以动员大学生利用暑假来整理这些图书呢？当然，如果这样，应付给他们一定的工资，至于档案和古器物能利用的就更少。我想有关部门应迅速解决这些问题。
    同时，我们现在提倡百家争鸣不同于古代百家争鸣和“兼容并包”之处，还在于现在的百家争鸣既然要发扬创造精神，建设社会主义，就不能各行其是，互不相干，而要团结互助，在充分的自由讨论中寻求真理以达到提高科学文化水平的目的。这就要求各科学文化部门能够密切配合。目前，我们在这方面还有许多缺点，例如研究机构与高等学校的配合就还不够密切。应该从各方面想办法改变这种情况。例如研究机构掌握着国家需要研究的问题，就可以要求高等学校协助解决；高等学校在完成教育任务过程中遇到困难也可以争取研究机构的帮助。我们面临着十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平的艰巨任务，只有动员一切力量，加以合理的严密组织，同心协力，才能不负党和人民的委托。
    由于久在病中，我对实际情况了解很不够，这些意见难免有主观片面之处，但是，百家争鸣方针的提出使我感到无限欢欣鼓舞，因此，我说出了心里所想的。我将和全体学术工作者一起为贯彻百家争鸣方针，迎接祖国文化建设高潮而辛勤努力。
