Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission held a sports work conference in Beijing from late July to early August, summarizing the sports work of the first half of this year and discussing several important issues in the current sports work.

The conference pointed out that national sports associations have now grown to twenty-one (including four sports association preparatory committees); most factories, mines, and enterprises with more than 100 people, 80% of universities and colleges, and about 30% of secondary schools have established grassroots sports associations. This has played a good role in giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of sports activists and accelerating the development of mass sports activities. In the future, it is still necessary to strengthen leadership, establish regular work for sports associations at all levels, enrich grassroots activities, and further consolidate grassroots sports associations.

The conference believes that school sports associations should, under the leadership of the school administration and based on the principle of student voluntarism, improve the technical level of students in various sports; at the same time, they should assist the school administration in actively promoting the "Labor and Defense System" and organizing mass sports activities. The sports teaching and research section should specifically guide the work of the sports association and undertake various administrative affairs to avoid increasing the burden on students. Sports cadres of the student union should actively participate in the work of the sports association council; the Communist Youth League organization should undertake political and ideological work. The conference believes that leadership should be strengthened for established school sports associations; schools that have not yet established sports associations may temporarily not establish them.

The "Labor and Defense System" was one of the most hotly debated issues at this conference. According to incomplete statistics, about two million people are currently participating in "Labor and Defense System" exercises. Among those in fourteen provinces and cities who completed all items of the "Labor and Defense System" test by the end of June this year, more than 320,000 reached various levels of standards.

The conference believes that the items stipulated in the current "Labor and Defense System" item standards (draft) can be further reduced, and the standards for some items are also too high. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has invited sports teachers and experts to conduct research and make necessary revisions based on the purpose of the "Labor and Defense System" and the current actual situation. The conference decided that before the promulgation of the revised new item standards, the weight-bearing for the ten-kilometer weight-bearing march in the current "Labor and Defense System" will be temporarily cancelled, and items 9 and 10 in levels 1 and 2 of the "Labor and Defense System" will be combined into one item, and the rest will be implemented according to the original regulations. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education have issued a joint notice on the above interim regulations on August 11th.

The conference believes that requiring graduates of higher and secondary schools in 1958 to basically reach various levels of standards can only be used as a work goal and should not be a specific requirement; schools with poor conditions can also temporarily not promote the "Labor and Defense System". In factories, mines, and enterprises and government agencies, the "Labor and Defense System" should only be promoted in units with a relatively good foundation for sports association work.

The conference emphasized that sports commissions at all levels and relevant departments must strictly prevent casualties and accidents. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen specific organization, publicity, and medical supervision. It is necessary to make the broad masses of young people understand that "Labor and Defense System" exercises and tests are organized by healthy people based on the principle of voluntarism; the principle of gradual progress must be strictly observed, and tests should be conducted on the basis of adequate exercise and in accordance with the sports season.

The conference pointed out that a total of nineteen national sports games were held in the first half of this year, and international competitions are also increasing. In the past seven months, 106 athletes in 68 events and 11 teams have broken the 1955 national records 290 times. Chen Jingkai created a world record of 133 kilograms in the clean and jerk with both hands in the lightest weight class. However, due to the lack of unified arrangements for national competition activities, the quality of competition activities is not high, and athletes participate in competitions too many times, resulting in unnecessary delays in work and classes. In the future, comprehensive and unified arrangements should be made for competition activities.

In addition, the conference also pointed out that in cadre training, short-term intensive and diverse methods must be adopted to ensure quality and train a large number of sports cadres and activists.

Those attending the conference included heads of sports commissions in various provinces and cities, as well as sports professors and sports teachers from some universities and secondary schools.

    全国体育工作会议
    讨论当前体育工作中的问题
    新华社15日讯  体育运动委员会从七月下旬到八月初在北京召开了体育工作会议，总结了今年上半年的体育工作，讨论了当前体育工作中几个重要问题。
    会议指出，目前，全国性的体育协会已经发展到二十一个（其中有四个体育协会筹备委员会）；大部分百人以上的工厂矿山企业、80％的高等学校和30％左右的中等学校，都建立了基层体育协会；这对发挥广大体育积极分子的积极性，加速开展群众性体育运动起了良好的作用。今后还必须加强领导，建立各级体育协会的经常工作，充实基层活动，进一步巩固基层体育协会。
    会议认为，学校体育协会应该在学校行政领导下，根据学生自愿原则，提高学生各项运动的技术水平；同时要协助学校行政积极推行“劳卫制”，举办群众性体育活动。体育教研室应具体指导体育协会的工作，并把各种行政事务工作担当起来，以免增加学生负担。学生会的体育干部应积极参加体育协会理事会的工作；青年团组织应担负起政治思想工作。会议认为，对已建立的学校体育协会，应加强领导；目前还没建立体育协会的学校，可以暂不建立。
    “劳卫制”是这次会议讨论最热烈的一个问题。据不完全统计，目前参加“劳卫制”锻炼的约有二百万人，十四个省、市在今年六月底测验完“劳卫制”全部项目的人当中，有三十二万多人达到了各级标准。
    会议认为，现行的“劳卫制”项目标准（草案）中规定的项目，还可以再减少一些，有些项目的标准也偏高，体育运动委员会已经邀请体育教师、专家进行研究，根据“劳卫制”的目的和当前的实际情况作必要的修改。会议决定，在修改后的新项目标准公布以前，暂将现行“劳卫制”中十公里负重行军的负重取消，将“劳卫制”一级和二级中第九和第十两项合为一项，其他仍按原规定实施。体育运动委员会、高等教育部、教育部在八月十一日已经对上述暂行规定发出联合通知。
    会议认为，要求1958年高等和中等学校毕业生基本上分别达到各级标准，只能作为工作上的奋斗目标，不作具体要求；有的学校条件差，也可以暂不推行“劳卫制”。在工厂矿山企业和机关中，只在体育协会工作基础比较好的单位推行“劳卫制”。
    会议强调指出，各级体育运动委员会和各有关部门必须严格防止伤亡事故。为此，必须加强具体的组织、宣传和医务监督等工作。要使广大青年了解：“劳卫制”锻炼和测验是身体健康的人根据自愿原则组织起来进行的；必须严格遵守循序渐进的原则，测验应在充分锻炼的基础上并且按照运动季节来进行。
    会议指出，今年上半年共举办了十九次全国性的运动会，国际竞赛也日益增多。七个月来，已经有六十八个项目、十一个队、106名运动员二百九十次打破了1955年的全国纪录。陈镜开创造了最轻量级双手挺举133公斤的世界纪录。但是，由于对全国竞赛活动缺乏统一安排，竞赛活动的质量还不高，运动员参加竞赛次数重复过多，发生了不必要的误工误课等现象。今后应对竞赛活动作全面统一的安排。
    此外，会议还指出，在干部训练工作上必须采取短期速成、多种多样的方式，以保证质量，大量地训练体育干部和积极分子。
    参加这次会议的有各省、市体育运动委员会的负责人和部分高等和中等学校的体育教授和体育教师等。
