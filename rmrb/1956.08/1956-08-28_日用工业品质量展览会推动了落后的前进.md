Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. The Daily Use Industrial Products Quality Exhibition in Beijing closed on the 25th.

The exhibition, which opened on July 7th, was visited by a total of 190,000 people. All provinces and cities in the country organized delegations to visit.

Visitors submitted more than 5,000 comments to the exhibition. Most believed that using comparisons of good and bad products for criticism and praise is an effective method for promoting product quality improvement. Many people from various provinces and cities specifically sent the poor-quality products they had bought to the exhibition, requesting them to be displayed in order to prompt the factories producing these products to quickly improve. Many people also praised the new and good products exhibited at the exhibition.

Most of the poor-quality products displayed during the preparation and preview period of the exhibition have already been improved in quality, with more than 2,300 improved products being put on display. The Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory's products used to be of poor quality; however, in recent months, there have been relatively significant improvements, with the products now featuring bright colors, uniform enamel, and more beautiful shapes and patterns than before. The "Red Feather" brand rubberized raincoat produced by the Tianjin Joint State-Private Southeast Raincoat Factory originally leaked; now, not only does it not leak, but it has also increased in variety, producing silk crepe de chine raincoats and poplin raincoats, work clothes-style raincoats suitable for workers and miners, and "farmhouse-style raincoats" suitable for rural field work.

Many factories with poor product quality are actively seeking ways to improve. The "Happiness Brand" thermos bottles produced by the Beijing Glass Factory, which were referred to as "time bombs" and "cold bottles," were listed as poor-quality products at the exhibition. Now, the Beijing Glass Factory has accepted criticism and is determined to improve the quality of thermos bottles. They have recovered all finished products from department stores, scrapped some, and sold some at reduced prices based on the principle of "pricing according to quality," and are responsible for returns and exchanges. At the same time, the factory has stopped production and organized a trial production team to re-study and trial produce. The Joint State-Private Gold Star Fountain Pen Factory has also, based on consumer feedback, examined its complacency, learned from advanced experience, and solved problems such as rough nibs, uneven ink flow, and unsuitable nib elasticity, and has now achieved initial results.

### 日用工业品质量展览会推动了落后的前进

    日用工业品质量展览会推动了落后的前进
    新华社25日讯　在北京展出的日用工业品质量展览会在二十五日闭幕。
    展览会从7月7日开幕以来，参观的人数共达十九万人。全国各省、市都组织了代表团去参观。
    参观者向展览会提出了五千多条意见。大都认为用好坏产品对比进行批评和表扬，是促进产品质量提高的一种有效方法。许多省、市的人民还特地把他们买到的质量低劣的产品寄给这个展览会，要求展出，以促使生产这些产品的工厂迅速改进。还有不少人赞扬展览会展出的新产品和好产品。
    展览会在筹备和预展期间陈列的质量低劣的产品，大部分的质量已经有了改进，其中有二千三百多件改进后的产品被陈列出来。石家庄搪瓷厂过去的产品质量低劣；但是最近几个月来，有了比较显著的改进，产品色泽光亮，搪瓷均匀，造型、图案也比过去美观。天津公私合营东南雨衣厂的产品“红羽牌”夹胶雨衣，原来漏雨；现在不但不漏水了，还增加了花色品种，生产了真丝碧绉雨衣和府绸雨衣、适合工矿职工需要的工作服式雨衣以及适合农村田间耕作时穿的“农庄式雨衣”。
    许多产品质量低劣的工厂，正在积极设法改进。被人们称为“定时炸弹”、“冷瓶”的北京市玻璃厂生产的“幸福牌”热水瓶，在展览会上是被列为质量低劣的产品的。现在，北京市玻璃厂接受了批评，决心改进热水瓶质量。他们向百货公司收回全部成品，一部分报废，一部分根据“按质论价”的原则廉价处理，并且负责保退保换。同时，厂内停止生产，组织试制小组重新研究试制。公私合营金星金笔厂也根据消费者的意见，检查了自满情绪，学习先进经验，解决笔尖粗毛、下水不匀、笔尖弹性不合适等问题，现在已经获得初步成效。
