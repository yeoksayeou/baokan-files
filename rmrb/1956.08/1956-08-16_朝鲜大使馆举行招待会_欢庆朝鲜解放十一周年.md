Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Over a thousand Chinese and foreign guests gathered in the hall of the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate the 11th anniversary of Korean Liberation.

At this grand reception, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei, and others, toasted the host of today's reception, Kim Gui-nam, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, to celebrate the festival.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, extended warm congratulations to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the heroic Korean people.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: "The Chinese people are deeply concerned about the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. We believe that the proposals put forward by the governments of China and North Korea regarding the convening of a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea are fair and reasonable. The United States has not only rejected the proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments but has also unilaterally announced the cessation of the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams in South Korea. Some senior American military personnel have recently clamored for further disruption of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Chinese people resolutely oppose any conspiracy to undermine peace in Korea and will continue to work with the Korean people and peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to uphold the Korean Armistice Agreement and seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean question." He said: "The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Korean people on their achievements and sincerely hope that the Korean people will achieve new and great victories in the great cause of national construction and the peaceful reunification of their motherland."

Vice Chairman Zhu De proposed a toast to the prosperity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the continued development of the fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean peoples, to peace in Asia and the world, and to the health of the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government.

Before Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech, Kim Gui-nam, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, said in his speech that the Korean people had encountered numerous difficulties in the work of restoring the people's economy, which had been devastated by the war, and in stabilizing the people's lives. However, encouraged by the active support and fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp, the Korean people overcame these difficulties with selfless labor and achieved great achievements.

Kim Gui-nam said: "The Korean people, who are engaged in the cause of peaceful construction, advocate that their primary task—the reunification of the motherland—must be resolved by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis. We believe that no matter how the U.S. imperialist aggressor groups and the South Korean authorities obstruct and what kind of sinister conspiracy they harbor, the Korean reunification issue will surely be resolved by peaceful means with the active support of peace-loving people all over the world and with the efforts of the Korean people."

Then, Kim Gui-nam raised his glass and invited Chinese and foreign guests to toast the friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, forged in blood, and to the health of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

Among the Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception were the heads of various departments of Chinese state organs, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, family members of soldiers and martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers, well-known figures from all walks of life, as well as envoys, diplomats, and commercial representatives from various countries to China.

    朝鲜大使馆举行招待会
    欢庆朝鲜解放十一周年
    据新华社15日讯　有一千多位中外人士今晚在北京饭店的大厅里，欢庆朝鲜解放十一周年。
    在这个盛大的招待会上，朱德副主席、彭真副委员长、陈毅副总理、外交部副部长章汉夫和姬鹏飞等，都同今天招待会的主人——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办金贵南干杯，祝贺这个节日。
    朱德副主席代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和英雄的朝鲜人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    朱德副主席说：“中国人民深切地关怀朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们认为，中朝两国政府提出的关于召开有关国家的会议协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题的建议是公正合理的。美国不仅拒绝了中朝两国政府的建议，而且片面宣布停止中立国监察委员会视察小组在南朝鲜的活动。美国的某些高级军事人员最近更叫嚣要进一步破坏朝鲜停战协定。中国人民坚决反对任何破坏朝鲜和平的阴谋，并将同朝鲜人民以及世界上爱好和平的国家和人民一道为维护朝鲜停战协定和谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决而继续努力。”他说：“中国人民热烈祝贺朝鲜人民所取得的成就，并衷心地希望朝鲜人民在国家建设和争取祖国的和平统一的伟大事业中获得新的、巨大的胜利。”
    朱德副主席提议为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的繁荣，为中朝两国人民的兄弟友谊和互助合作事业的继续发展，为亚洲和世界和平，为朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府领导同志们的健康干杯。
    在朱德副主席讲话以前，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办金贵南在致词中谈到，朝鲜人民在恢复惨遭战争破坏的人民经济的工作中，以及在安定人民生活方面，曾遇到重重困难，但是，为伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营其它各国的积极声援和兄弟般的帮助所鼓舞的朝鲜人民，以忘我的劳动冲破和克服了这些困难，并获得了巨大的成就。
    金贵南说：“进行和平建设事业的朝鲜人民主张，自己的首要任务——祖国统一问题，必须在民主基础上由朝鲜人民自己解决。我们相信，不论美帝国主义侵略集团和南朝鲜当局怎样阻挠，抱有什么样的凶恶阴谋，但是在全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持下，在朝鲜人民的努力下，朝鲜统一问题一定能够用和平方法解决。”
    然后，金贵南举杯请中外客人为朝中两国人民以鲜血结成的友谊和团结，为以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导者们的健康干杯。
    出席招待会的中外客人中，有中国国家机关各部门的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，中国人民志愿军军人家属、烈士家属，社会各界著名人士，以及各国驻中国的使节、外交官员和商务代表等。
