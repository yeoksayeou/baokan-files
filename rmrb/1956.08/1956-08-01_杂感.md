Random Thoughts
Sima Niu

    A young female worker in a certain factory was once on friendly terms with a young male worker, but later fell in love with a college graduate technician in the factory. The young male worker was heartbroken, and his work suffered as a result. The leadership criticized the female worker, and indignantly said: "Nowadays, women only like to choose those with culture and technology. They are called workers, but in fact, their bourgeois ideology is very strong!"
    According to this, men and women should only make friends and fall in love with someone at "first sight"; only those without culture and technology can be considered proletarian; national vocational schools and universities are places for manufacturing the bourgeoisie.

    Books displayed in bookstores are easily dirtied by customers – this is undoubtedly a problem in bookstore management. So, some shop assistants suggested locking the displayed books in glass cabinets, and he was then selected as an advanced worker.
    This is clearly a misunderstanding of the word "advanced." It is probably also a misunderstanding of the word "work," because displaying books for customers to browse is a kind of "work" to attract readers to buy books, while locking them up is "not working."
    We must oppose such a life philosophy: the more you do (work), the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; if you do nothing, you make no mistakes.

    杂感

    某厂一个青年女工先曾和一个青年工人有较深友谊，但是后来和厂里的一个大学毕业生技术员相爱了。青年工人失恋，工作受到影响。领导方面批评了这个女工。并且不胜其义愤地说道：“如今的妇女尽喜欢挑有文化、有技术的。名是工人，其实资产阶级思想浓厚得很！”
    这么说来，男女交友、恋爱，概须“一见倾心”；没有文化、技术，才算无产阶级；国家专科、高等学校乃是制造资产阶级的场所。

    陈列在书店里的书籍容易被顾客弄脏——不能不说在书店经营上是一个问题。于是有的店员建议把陈列的书籍锁在玻璃柜子里，这样他就被选为先进工作者了。
    这显然是对“先进”一词的误解。恐怕也是对“工作”一词的误解，因为把书籍陈列出来让顾客翻看，这就是一种吸引读者买书的“工作”，而锁起来就是“不工作”。
    要反对这样一种人生哲学：多做（工作）多错，少做少错，不做不错。
