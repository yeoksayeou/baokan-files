Editor's Note: Representatives of provincial-level agencies of Anhui Province attending the First Anhui Provincial Party Congress have many opinions on this newspaper's July 18th publication of the report on the convening of the Anhui Provincial Party Congress, believing that this report and its title have shortcomings. After examination by the editorial department of this newspaper, it is also believed that this report and its title do indeed have shortcomings. The opinions reflected by the Anhui Provincial-Level Agencies Party Committee are now published below as a correction.

  (I) Opinions on the entire report:

	Most representatives believe that this report is one-sided and unrealistic. Some said: "Judging from our personal participation in the congress and our understanding of the situation, this congress was successful; but judging from the report, it gives the impression that the shortcomings of this congress are the main aspect." Some said: "The title of the report does not match the content, and the content of the report does not match the actual situation of the congress." Some believe: "This report did not report on the main aspects of the congress. For example, it did not mention that the congress comprehensively summarized the work, fully promoted democracy, and carried out criticism and self-criticism, but instead exaggerated certain individual shortcomings and individual opinions into prominent problems of the entire meeting. This is incorrect, and we are dissatisfied."

  (II) Opinions on several issues in the report:

	(1) Regarding the issue of "insufficient self-criticism in the Provincial Party Committee's work report."

	Most representatives said: "The Provincial Party Committee's work report is comprehensive, and the criticism is profound. We are satisfied. The report not only examined and self-criticized the shortcomings and existing problems in various tasks, but also conducted an examination of leaders at all levels, especially the Provincial Party Committee leadership, in the final part of the report. We believe that this report is imbued with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. It is incorrect to say that the self-criticism in the Provincial Party Committee's work report is poor simply because some provincial-level responsible comrades did not offer sufficient criticism and self-criticism in their speeches at the congress." During the group discussions at the representatives' congress, there were various different opinions on the issue of self-criticism in the Provincial Party Committee's report. Some individual representatives mentioned that "the Provincial Party Committee's work report examined the shortcomings in various tasks, but the self-criticism of the Provincial Party Committee's leadership was insufficient." However, there were also the following other opinions: The first opinion was that we do not think the Provincial Party Committee's self-criticism was insufficient, but rather that such a sentence was not added in writing: "The Provincial Party Committee bears leadership responsibility for all these shortcomings." If such a sentence were added, it would be clearer. The second opinion was that the above-mentioned shortcoming also does not exist, because the report clearly stated that "if we did not have these shortcomings, then our work achievements would be greater, and the shortcomings would be fewer." This sentence expresses the Provincial Party Committee's responsible attitude towards shortcomings and errors. The third opinion was that, according to our understanding, the Provincial Party Committee's examination of the shortcomings and errors in various tasks is a comprehensive examination of the shortcomings and errors in the Provincial Party Committee's work. Shortcomings and errors cannot be separated from specific work, and it is impossible to profoundly expose errors if they are separated from specific work.

	In addition, some reflected that: The report stated that "although the Provincial Party Committee's work report talked about general shortcomings and errors in the work, the self-criticism was insufficient." Judging from the meaning of this sentence, it seems that there are still some particularly serious problems that have not been examined. We believe that if the reporter does have that kind of implication, then it is incorrect.

	(2) Regarding the issue of "insufficient bottom-up criticism."

	Most representatives believe that bottom-up criticism and self-criticism were seriously carried out in the group discussions. Critical opinions were put forward on the Provincial Party Committee's work report and on the candidates, and all opinions were expressed. Some representatives said: According to our understanding, there were only so many problems and opinions, and all opinions were raised. The report stated that "many other opinions were also put forward to the Provincial Party Committee at the group meetings." The so-called other opinions are unknown, making people feel inexplicable.

	Some believe that "the speeches of individual responsible comrades of departments and committees of the Provincial Party Committee focused on business, some had the flavor of assigning work, or pointed fingers at subordinates too much, lacking the spirit of self-criticism." But some also believe that "the speeches of several responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee did make self-criticism and were very educational."

	(3) Regarding the issue of "improving the leadership of the congress."

	The representatives believe that the statement in the report about "improving the leadership of the congress" gives the impression that this congress took a detour and deviated, but in fact, the presidium has always grasped the leadership of the congress very tightly, and the meeting was proceeding normally, and nothing went wrong. Therefore, we do not have the feeling that the report said "the leadership of the congress was improved."

	(4) Regarding the election issue.

	The representatives reflected that: Judging from the report, it seems that the presidium was very imprudent in proposing the list of candidates, resulting in a very passive and tense situation, but this is not the case. The presidium was prudent in proposing the list of candidates, the representatives were serious in deliberating and discussing the list of candidates, and the election was proceeding normally. Passive and tense situations did not exist.

	(5) Regarding the issue of "production and unified purchase tasks being set too rigidly."

	The representatives believe that the report says: "The representatives raised opinions about the Provincial Party Committee's leadership in agricultural production and grain purchase, etc., where the tasks were set too rigidly and the demands were too high for some regions, believing that this was one of the reasons that prompted coercive orders in some regions." It is known that this is only the opinion of individual representatives in individual regions, but it is inaccurate to generalize it as the opinion of the representatives in the report.

	(6) Regarding the issue of "separation of party and government."

	The representatives believe that: The phenomenon of "separation of party and government" mentioned in the report is mainly proposed by our provincial-level agencies delegation, but the original intention is to say that the Provincial People's Committee should frequently convene meetings of directors of departments and bureaus in the future, because many of the cadres at the level of directors of departments and bureaus are democratic personages, and holding such meetings more often is beneficial to giving play to the role of democratic personages, and it does not mean that there are any serious problems in the relationship between the party and the government.

### 安徽省直属机关出席省党代表大会的代表  对本报关于安徽省党代表大会报道的意见

    安徽省直属机关出席省党代表大会的代表
    对本报关于安徽省党代表大会报道的意见
    编者按：安徽省直属机关出席省第一次党代表大会的代表，对于本报七月十八日刊登的安徽省召开党代表大会的报道有不少意见，认为这一报道和标题都有缺点，经本报编辑部检查，也认为这一报道和标题确有缺点。现在将安徽省直属机关党委会反映的意见发表如下，作为更正。
  （一）对整个报道的意见：
    大多数代表认为这个报道是片面的，是不切实际的。有的说：“从我们亲身参加大会了解的情况看，这次大会是成功的；但从报道中看，就使人感到这次大会的缺点是主要的。”有的说：“报道的标题与内容不符，报道的内容又与大会的情况不符。”有的认为：“这个报道没有把大会的主要方面报道出来。如对大会全面总结了工作，充分地发扬了民主，开展了批评和自我批评都未提到，而是把某些个别缺点和个别人的见解夸大成整个会议的突出问题，这是不对的，我们是不满意的。”
    （二）对报道中几个问题的意见：
    （1）关于“省委工作报告中自我批评差”的问题。
    多数代表说：“省委工作报告是全面的，批评是深刻的，我们是满意的。报告中既对各项工作的缺点和存在的问题进行了检查和自我批判，又在报告的最后一部分对各级领导首先对省委领导进行了检查，我们认为这个报告是贯注了批评和自我批评精神的。把某些省一级负责人在大会发言中批评与自我批评不够，说成是省委工作报告中自我批评差，是不正确的。”在代表大会小组讨论时，对省委报告中的自我批评问题有各种不同意见，其中是有个别代表提到“省委工作报告中对各项工作的缺点都检查了，但对省委领导方面自我批评不够。”但另外还有以下几种意见：第一种说，我们不是认为省委自我批评不够，而是认为在文字上没有加上这样一句话：“所有这些缺点，省委都是负有领导责任的。”如果加上这么一句就更加明确了。第二种说，上述这个缺点也不存在，因为报告中已明明提到“如果我们没有这些毛病，那么我们的工作成绩就会大一些，缺点就会少一些。”这句话就表示了省委对缺点和错误的负责态度。第三种说，根据我们理解，省委检查了各项工作中的缺点和错误，就是全盘检查省委工作中的缺点和错误，缺点和错误不能与具体工作分开，离开了具体工作就不可能深刻地揭发错误。
    另外，有的反映说：报道中所说“省委工作报告虽然谈到了工作中的一般缺点和错误，但自我批评不够。”从这句话的意思看，好像还有什么特殊严重的问题没有检查，我们认为如果报道人确有那种涵意，则是不对的。
    （2）关于“自下而上批评少”的问题。
    多数代表认为：在小组讨论中都认真地开展了自下而上的批评和自我批评，对省委工作报告、对候选人都提出了批评意见，做到了有什么意见就讲什么意见。有的代表说：据我们了解，问题和意见就是那么多，有意见都提了。报道中所说“小组会上还对省委提了不少其他意见”，所谓其他的意见不知指的是什么，使人感到莫名其妙。
    有的认为：“省委个别部委负责同志在会上的发言，对业务谈的多，有的像布置工作一样的味道，或者对下面指责的多，缺乏自我批评精神。”但也有的认为：“省委几个负责同志的发言是作了自我批评的，教育意义很大。”
    （3）关于“改进大会领导”的问题。
    代表们认为报道中关于“改进了对大会的领导”的说法，使人感到这次大会好像走了弯路，出了偏差，但事实上主席团对大会的领导始终是抓得很紧的，会议的进行是正常的，并没有发生什么问题，因此报道中所说“改进了对大会的领导”，我们是没有这个感觉的。
    （4）关于选举问题。
    代表们反映说：从报道看，好像主席团对候选人名单的提出很不慎重，以致搞得很被动很紧张，但事实并非如此。主席团对候选人名单的提出是慎重的，代表们对候选人名单酝酿和讨论是认真的，选举的进行是正常的，被动和紧张的情况是不存在的。
    （5）关于“生产和统购任务规定太死”的问题。
    代表们认为报道中说：“代表们对省委在领导农业生产和购粮等工作中，对某些地区规定任务太死，要求过大，提出了意见，认为这是促使某些地区发生强迫命令的原因之一。”据知这只是个别地区个别代表的意见，但在报道中把它笼统地说成代表们的意见，这也是不符实际的。
    （6）关于“党政不分”的问题。
    代表们认为：报道中提出的“党政不分”的现象，据知主要是我们省直机关代表团提出的，但本意是说今后省人民委员会应该经常召开厅局长会议，因厅局长一级干部中有不少是民主人士，多开这种会议，对发挥民主人士的作用是有好处的，并不是说在党政关系中有什么严重的问题存在。
