Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch from Bangkok: The semi-monthly magazine "Homeland" published an editorial on July 25th stating, "For the sake of the nation and the people, the government should be determined to recognize the People's Republic of China."

The editorial advocated that Thailand should implement an independent and autonomous foreign policy in international affairs, rather than acting as a follower of the United States.

The editorial said: "Now China has become an invincible and strong nation. Because we are both Asian peoples and share the same destiny, the Thai people sympathize with and support the Chinese people. At the same time, we can fully hope that the Thai people will also receive sympathy and fraternal assistance from the Chinese people."

The editorial cited Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the National People's Congress in June, in which he expressed China's willingness to be friendly with Thailand, and advocated that Thailand accept the hand of friendship extended by the Chinese people.

    泰国应接受中国人民的友谊之手
    新华社30日讯　曼谷消息：“祖国”半月刊七月二十五日发表社论说，“为了国家和人民的利益，政府应当下决心承认中华人民共和国”。
    社论主张，泰国应当在国际事务中实行独立自主的外交政策，而不是作为美国的追随者。
    社论说：“现在中国已经变成不可征服的坚强的大国了，由于同是亚洲人民，又有着同样的命运，因此泰国人民同情和支持中国人民。同时，我们也可以充分希望，泰国人民也将从中国人民那里获得同情和兄弟般的援助”。
    社论援引了周恩来总理六月间在全国人民代表大会上关于中国愿意同泰国友好的讲话，并且主张泰国接受中国人民伸出的友谊的手。
