Seven Proposals for Improving the Lives of Workers
Lü Tao

Editor's Note: The Harbin Municipal People's Committee's planned and comprehensive improvement of workers' lives is a very good practice. We recommend this article to our readers, and we especially hope that relevant leading comrades in various cities will read it.

The Harbin Municipal People's Committee passed seven proposals on improving the lives of workers on July 13. These proposals are: "Regarding the Housing Problem of Workers," "Improving the Management of Workers' Canteens," "Facilitating Sunday Rest and Changing the Hours of Supply and Service Industries," "Adjusting Electric Bus Fares, Routes, and Running Times," "Adjusting Clothing Processing Fees," "Improving the Work of Service Industries," and "Improving the Management of Lighting Electricity Consumption." The most obvious characteristic of these proposals is that they solve workers' living problems from multiple aspects, most of which do not require the state to spend money but are solved by improving work.

Let's first talk about the housing problem of workers. From the overall situation, the population of Harbin has increased greatly in recent years. In 1948, the city's population was 637,000, and now it has increased to nearly 1.4 million, a growth of more than double. During the same period, the residential area increased by only 21.3%. Based on this situation, building more houses is necessary and is the fundamental way to solve the problem. However, it is not possible to do so in a short period due to the state's financial and material resources. Therefore, when the Harbin Municipal People's Committee studied and discussed the proposal on workers' housing problems, in addition to planning to build some new houses, it also proposed the following two methods: one is to organize the exchange of housing between departments, between workers, and between residents; the other is to mobilize units and citizens with surplus housing to give up part of their houses through ideological education and political propaganda. These two methods were proposed under the following circumstances: According to a survey by the Harbin Municipal Real Estate Administration of 26,474 employees in 25 agencies and factories, 4,813 employees lived far from their workplaces and resided in different districts, and these employees requested housing from their units because they lived far from their workplaces. If they are helped to find suitable people to exchange houses with, they can live closer to the factory and they will not need housing. Another basis is that, although the city's housing is very tight, some units and citizens have not made good use of some of their houses, so it is possible to educate the units and citizens in a guided manner, so that they understand the difficult housing situation in the city and promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and give up the surplus houses. Through these two methods, we can make up for the current difficulties that the state's financial and material resources are limited and cannot build more housing.

Take the workers' canteen as an example. The proposal stipulates that the wages of cooks and managers and furniture expenses are borne by the state, which can reduce food costs somewhat. However, in addition to the above factors, the high food costs and the dissatisfaction of the masses are also related to the poor management of the canteen, the lack of attention to saving, the high prices of vegetables, and the small variety of supplies from the grain department. Therefore, in the "Improving the Management of Workers' Canteens" proposal, the Harbin Municipal People's Committee specifically pointed out that costs should be reduced in all aspects, requiring each worker's canteen to establish and revise various management methods and reward methods, mobilize workers to supervise the canteen, and overcome waste in the canteen. It also requires the grain department to increase the variety of supplies. In addition, it also advocates that canteens with suitable conditions raise pigs in the suburbs.

Many department stores and food stores in Harbin close very early, and it is difficult for workers to buy daily necessities and non-staple foods for the next day after dinner. The catering industry is also the same. After watching movies and dramas in the evening, workers are hungry and cannot get food. On Sundays, because workers concentrate on resting, the city's trams, buses, and ships on the river are very crowded. For these problems, the Municipal People's Committee passed a proposal: The business hours of stores belonging to the city's department stores, food, and trading companies were uniformly arranged, so that stores could be open from 5:00 am to 11:00 pm. At the same time, it also mobilized restaurants near entertainment venues to close after the show ended. The proposal also stipulates that trams and buses will extend business hours on Sundays. In order to allow workers to spend a pleasant holiday, some service companies are required to not rest on Sundays.

The above is only a part of the seven proposals passed by the Harbin Municipal People's Committee. Some of the problems may seem to be minor, but often these "minor matters" cause workers distress, so when solving workers' living problems, problems should be solved for workers from all aspects. Although some of them do not cost money, doing them well will benefit workers no less than the benefits obtained by spending money.

### 改善职工生活的七个方案

    改善职工生活的七个方案
    吕涛
    编者按：哈尔滨市人民委员会有计划地全面地改善职工生活，这种做法很好。我们向读者推荐这篇文章，特别希望各个城市有关的领导同志都来读一读它。
    哈尔滨市人民委员会七月十三日讨论通过了七项关于改善职工生活的方案，这些方案是：“关于职工住宅问题”，“改进职工食堂的管理”、“便利星期日的休息、改变供应、服务行业时间”“调整电汽车票价、线路、运行时间”“调整服装加工费”“改进服务性行业的工作”和“改进照明用电管理”。这些方案非常明显的特点是从多方面来解决职工生活问题，其中绝大部分是用不着国家花钱，而是通过改善工作来解决的。
    先以职工住宅问题来说，从总的情况看，哈尔滨市的人口几年来有很大的增加，1948年全市人口共六十三万七千人，到现在已增加到近一百四十万人，即增长一倍以上；而同一时期住宅面积不过增加了21.3％。根据这个情况，增建一些房屋是必要的，也是从根本上解决问题的方法。但是，在短时间内因国家财力、物力所限，还不可能这样做。所以哈尔滨市人民委员会在研究讨论职工住宅问题的方案时，除了计划新建一部分房屋以外，还提出了下面两个方法：一是组织部门之间、职工之间、居民之间互换住房；一是通过思想教育和政治宣传，动员用房有余的单位和市民让出一部分房子。这两个办法是在这样的情况下提出的：据哈尔滨市房地产管理局对二十五个机关、工厂中两万六千四百七十四名职工的调查，离工作岗位较远、跨区居住的就有四千八百十三名，这些职工因为离工作地点较远，便向本单位提出要房子。如果帮助他们找适当的对象互换房屋，能够住得离厂比较近些，他们就可以不要房子。另一个根据是，虽然全市的房屋很紧张，但是有些单位和市民却有部分房屋没有很好地利用，所以有领导地向各单位和市民进行教育，使他们了解全市房屋的困难情况，发扬互助友爱的精神，把多余的房子让出来，是可能的。通过这两个办法，就可以弥补目前因国家财力、物力有限而不能更多地建筑住宅的困难。
    再拿职工食堂来看，方案规定炊事员、管理人员的工资和家具费由国家负担，可以使伙食成本降低一些，但除了上述因素以外，伙食成本高，群众不满意的原因也同食堂管理不善，不注意节约，以及买菜价格过高，粮食部门供应品种过少有关。所以哈尔滨市人民委员会在“改进职工食堂管理”的方案里，特别指出从各方面降低成本，要求各个职工食堂建立和修订职工食堂各项管理办法和奖励办法，发动职工对食堂进行监督，克服食堂中的浪费现象。并且要求粮食部门增加供应品种。此外，还提倡有条件的食堂在郊区养猪。
    哈尔滨市许多百货商店和食品商店闭店时间很早，职工们在吃过晚饭后，就很难买到日用品和第二天要用的副食品。饮食业也是一样，职工在晚间看过电影和戏剧以后，肚子饿了，就吃不到饭。到了星期天，因为职工集中休息，市内的电车、汽车和江上的船只都非常拥挤。对于这些问题，市人民委员会通过了一项方案：对全市百货、食品、贸易公司所属商店的营业时间作了统一安排，可以作到从清晨五点钟到夜间十一点钟，都有商店营业。同时也动员娱乐场所附近的饮食店，等到散场后再闭店。方案还规定，电车、汽车在星期日延长营业时间。为了让职工能够愉快地度过假日，要求一部分服务性企业可以不在星期日休息。
    上面所说的这些，只是哈尔滨市人民委员会通过的七项方案的一部分内容，其中有些问题，看起来可能是小事，但是，常常是这些“小事”使职工苦恼，所以在解决职工生活问题的时候，就应当从各方面来为职工解决问题。虽然其中有些是不用花钱的，但是做好了，它给职工的好处，并不亚于花钱所得来的好处。
