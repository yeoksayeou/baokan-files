Sesshū and His Art
Fu Baoshi

　　Dwelling in the bay of Penglai weak waters, his demeanor is refined and transcends the mortal realm,
　　Long admired for his poems surpassing the mundane, only his paintings remain in the world,
　　Flying away to Vulture Peak with his tin staff, traversing the whale waves for ten thousand miles in a cup;
　　Knowing where to find him in longing after parting, the moon in the sky, clouds on the mountain.

This is a poem written by the poet Xu Lian in 1469 (the fifth year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty, the first year of Civilization in Japan) to bid farewell to the Japanese painter Sesshū when he returned home from Ningbo. From this poem, we can keenly feel the extremely sincere friendship hidden within the literary connection between the poet and the painter.

Sesshū is a landmark painter in Japan, and the one who completed Japanese ink painting, especially ink landscape painting. His remarkable achievements not only mark the ever-admirable height of Japanese painting in the fifteenth century, but more importantly, through his extraordinary talent and selfless labor, he creatively combined the ideological feelings of the Japanese people on the basis of ink's vigor and abbreviated splash ink expressions, and finally successfully formed his own national style, inherited and developed the excellent traditions of Japanese national painting, and enriched the content of Japanese culture. It is entirely understandable and very natural that the Japanese people unanimously respect him as "one in a thousand ages" and "the painting sage of ancient and modern times."

In the long history of cultural exchanges between China and Japan, which is most worthy of cherishing, the spirit of close and integrated relations between the two peoples is brilliantly embodied, and modeling art should be a more prominent department, and among modeling art, there is nothing like painting, especially ink painting. In the history of Japanese painting, Sesshū reached this glorious peak.

Sesshū is one of the world cultural celebrities commemorated this year as called for by the World Peace Council. With unparalleled intimacy, yearning, and reverence, I will try to review Sesshū and his immortal art, in order to express my enthusiasm for commemoration in a small way.

Sesshū grew up in the Muromachi period (1333-1573) when the conflict between the Japanese medieval samurai regime and the nobility was fierce. This era was: an era when "rebellions" occurred everywhere, and the Ashikaga shogunate was always in a tense, overwhelmed so-called "gekokujo"① situation; at the same time, this era was also: an era in which the Song and Yuan cultures, especially ink painting – this beautiful and vigorous flower cultivated by the Chinese and Japanese people – inherited from the Kamakura period (1192-1333), blossomed and bore fruit on Japanese soil.

Originally, since the late Kamakura period, Japanese painting had fallen into formal Buddhist paintings and "Yamato-e" (mainly picture scrolls) rooted in aristocratic culture, which were only engaged in illustrative or documentary purposes, and could no longer meet the needs of the new era. What replaced them and gained wide love and respect was vigorous ink painting, especially ink landscape painting. The visits of Yuan monks Yishan Yining and Liang Quan to Japan, and the efforts of Japanese monks such as Muan Ryoen, Tesshu Tokuji, Muso Kokushi... and even Mincho, Josetsu, and Shubun, all made great contributions to the development of Japanese ink painting. In particular, the two outstanding painters Josetsu and Shubun played an extremely important bridging role in Sesshū's art.

Sesshū's surname was Oda (or from the Fujiwara clan), his given name was Tōyō, and his art name was Sesshū, also known as Bikeisai, Gyochosai, Beigensanshu, and Unkokuken, etc., or called Sesshū Tōyō, or Tōyō Sesshū. There are also those who use Yang as the surname and call him Yang Sesshū or Yang Zhike. Why is he named "Tōyō"? According to Yamagata Shunan's "Biography of Sesshū": "It is because he admired Yang Buzhi's escape to Zen." Yang Buzhi was a great patriotic painter in the Southern Song Dynasty in China.

In 1420 (the eighteenth year of Yongle in the Ming Dynasty, the twenty-seventh year of Ōei in Japan), Sesshū was born in Akahama Village, Akaiwa County, Bitchū Province (now Okayama Prefecture), Japan. According to legend, when he was twelve or thirteen years old, his father sent him to the nearby Hofuku Temple of the Tendai sect to become a monk, but the young Sesshū neither worshipped Buddha nor recited scriptures, but just liked to paint. Because of painting, the old abbot once tied him to a pillar, but he dipped his toes in his own tears and drew a mouse on the floor, which moved the old abbot, and he let him paint from then on. This story is still talked about by the Japanese people.

Later, Sesshū went to Daitoku-ji and Shokoku-ji in Kyoto, the center of aristocratic power, and Kencho-ji in Kamakura, the center of samurai power, and inevitably studied Zen as a disciple. Although the specific activities of this period up to 1467 (when Sesshū was forty-eight years old) are still not clear, given his noteworthy actions in his later years after his fame and with generals (such as refusing Ōuchi Yoshioki's earnest invitation and recommending Kano Masanobu to paint murals for Ashikaga Yoshimasa... etc.), we can believe that he was a painter who was loyal to the nation, loyal to reality, and loyal to art, with lofty aspirations.

1468 (the fourth year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty, the second year of Ōnin in Japan) was the second year of the so-called "Ōnin War," a large-scale civil war that lasted for ten years in Japanese history. Sesshū came to China with the "missionary ship to Ming China" led by Ten'yo Seikei. He first stayed at Tentō-ji Temple in Ningbo, Zhejiang, one of the five major Zen temples and closely related to the founder of Japanese Zen Buddhism, Eisai, and was soon revered as the "chief seat," which can be proved by the inscription "Tentō First Seat" that is often seen on some of Sesshū's works after his return to Japan.

Although Sesshū's visit to China was short, it forged many unforgettable literary connections and left behind many masterpieces depicting Chinese mountains, rivers, famous attractions, and historical stories. At the request of his Chinese friends, he painted "Mount Fuji, Miho, and Seiken-ji Temple," a scenic view of the Eastern Sea of Japan, which made the famous calligrapher and painter Zhan Zhonghe happily praise it and write an enthusiastic poem: "Riding the wind, I want to travel east, especially to steal the feathered clothes from the pine forest"②. He also painted Ningbo Prefecture, Yūō-ji Temple, West Lake, Jing Mountain Temple, the Yangtze River, and Jinshan Temple, which prominently illustrates the inseparable traditional friendship between artists of the two countries who admire, respect, and learn from each other.

Sesshū also traveled up the Grand Canal to Beijing and painted murals in the central hall of the "Ministry of Rites," which gained extremely high praise. "The Minister Yao... summoned the students and pointed to the wall and said: 'This is the wonderful ink art of the Japanese monk Yang Sesshū. Even foreigners have such superb skills. Why don't you work hard to reach this realm!…'"③, his importance was promoted in this way.

When Sesshū came to China, Chinese painting had basically broken through some fixed forms and styles formed in the late Southern Song Dynasty and began a new change—that is, on the traditional basis of vigorous ink, abbreviated brushwork, and splash ink, it advanced in the direction of ink freehand landscape painting through the development of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. This objective fact, placed before Sesshū, who had gained deep insights into the art of Ma Yuan, Xia Gui, Muqi, and Yu Jian, could not but become a new subject. In 1495 (the eighth year of Hongzhi in the Ming Dynasty, the fourth year of Meio in Japan), when Sesshū was seventy-six years old, he inscribed these words on the "Broken Ink Landscape"④ to his disciple Suisui Sogen: "I once entered the Great Song Kingdom, traveled north across the Great River, passed through the suburbs of Qi and Lu to Luoyang to seek painting masters, but there were few who wielded their brushes with purity and grace. Here, Zhang Yousheng⑤ and Li Zai gained timely fame, and they passed on the essence of color setting and the method of broken ink. I returned to my homeland after several years. …" From this extremely important inscription, Sesshū seemed to feel a certain degree of regret during his trip to China because there were few painters who "wielded their brushes with purity and grace" at that time. However, "The mountains of Taihua and Hengyue, the waters of the Jiang, Huai, and He Ji, the differences between plants, trees, birds, and animals, and the differences between people's customs, are the paintings of the Great Tang Kingdom; and the method of splashing ink and the art of wielding the brush, gained in the heart and responding to the hand, are in me and not in others, and there is no teacher in the Great Tang Kingdom."⑥ We believe that this way of understanding Sesshū is more objective and therefore more realistic. At the same time, we cannot help but deeply regret that Sesshū's time in China was not very sufficient, collective travel was not very convenient, and several landscape painters who were somewhat representative at that time: Dai Wenjin (died around 1426-1435) died; Du Dongyuan (Qiong) (1396-1474) was old; Yao Yundong (Shou) (died around 1423-1495) and Shen Shitian (Zhou) (1427-1507), who were about the same age as Sesshū, had no chance to meet.

After returning to Japan in 1469 (the fifth year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty, the first year of Civilization in Japan), Sesshū once settled in Bungo Province, one of the centers of Zen Buddhism, and built a house called "Tenkai Zugarō" (Studio of Heaven-Revealed Painting). Later, when he was nearly seventy years old, he moved to Yamaguchi in Suō Province. Yamaguchi was a newly emerging city in the Muromachi shogunate period. He rebuilt his studio there, still named "Tenkai Zugarō." According to legend, not long after, because he refused the invitation of the feudal lord Ōuchi Yoshioki, he was persecuted and expelled from Yamaguchi and moved to Bōshū, living in Daikian in Iwami and Masuda counties. He probably settled here from then on and spent his healthy later years.

In August 1506 (the first year of Zhengde in the Ming Dynasty, the third year of Eishō in Japan), Sesshū, a landmark painter in Japan, died at the age of eighty-seven at Daikian in Iwami. This year is the 450th anniversary of his death.

Sesshū is a master painter in painting with all styles being exquisite and the national style being extremely distinct. According to the information and relics, I think it can be said that: Sesshū's paintings, landscape first, figure second, and flower and bird again.

"Figures of Taoism and Buddhism are based on Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty and Liang Kai of the Song Dynasty; landscapes, trees, and rocks are either from Ma Yuan or Xia Gui; the ink is dripping, with its own elegant taste, like the flow of Ruofen, a monk in West Lake; sweeping out clouds and mountains, startling people's ears and eyes, like Gao Yanjing, a monk in the Western Regions; water birds and mountain beasts are like Yi Yuanji of Changsha; colored flowers and birds are like Qian Shunju of Zhaxi; dragons, tigers, apes, cranes, reeds, wild geese, and egrets are slightly modeled after Fa Chang and removed his roughness and evil, and ink ghosts and Zhong Kui are quite like Gong Cuiyan's strangeness…"⑦ These are the words of Xingwu Liangxin, who traveled to China with Sesshū and had close relations with him, and is a more specific and comprehensive analysis of the origin and inheritance of Sesshū's art. Of course, this is a very important piece of information. To be honest, such an all-round painter was still rare in China after the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, we can hardly agree to focus solely on Sesshū's landscape works, especially some landscape works that are stylistically close to the vigorous ink paintings of the Southern Song Dynasty, and simply say that Sesshū is a "Northern School painting," or simply say that he is pursuing the so-called "Zhe School," which only existed in China in the early and mid-fifteenth century and did not play a leading role at that time. These are worth studying views that reduce and lower Sesshū's achievements.

Sesshū's landscape painting is the earliest and most outstanding completion of Japanese landscape painting in the history of Japanese landscape painting—after gradually detaching itself from being the background of picture scrolls. Because ink-based landscape painting (including ink and light color) matured in China in the tenth century of the Northern Song Dynasty, its development process is quite complex. Generally speaking, through the efforts of Dong Yuan, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, Mi Fu, Guo Xi, and Li Tang, a new style of vigorous ink paintings of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui and abbreviated splash ink paintings of Muqi and Yu Jian was formed in the Southern Song Dynasty. Their works, especially those of Ma, Xia, Mu, and Yu, were quickly welcomed after being introduced to Japan. After Josetsu, Shubun and other efforts to absorb and integrate, especially after Sesshū returned to Japan, nearly forty years of tenacious artistic labor laid a solid foundation for Japanese landscape painting and thereby promoted the rise of Japanese landscape painting.

The "Landscape Scroll" is Sesshū's landscape painting—it should be said to be the most representative work of all his remains. As far as I know, its scale, its grandeur, the richness of its content, and the depth of its touchingness are indeed masterpieces in the world of landscape painting that can be compared with Xia Gui's "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" in the Southern Song Dynasty. It is a treasure in the painting heritage of the Japanese Kamakura period; it is one of the important contributions made by Japanese painters to the world of modeling art. As for the compositional form of the "long scroll" (creative and appreciative), it was originally one of the forms that the people of China and Japan were accustomed to, loved, and good at using. In China, it was popular in the Southern Song Dynasty, but in Japan, it developed in the Kamakura period. But the key to the problem is not here. From the perspective of the realistic spirit of the "Landscape Scroll," Sesshū is truly "mountains and rivers without barriers, and light everywhere"⑧, using Chinese mountains and rivers as the keynote, showing his deep natural observation and rich artistic conception creation, closely combining with the preferences of the Japanese people everywhere, breaking through all the limitations of time and space, especially the limitations of seasons and climate, and vividly and organically integrating the moving scenery of the four seasons into a picture. We believe that this is what Chinese painters find difficult and what Japanese painters are particularly good at.

The "Landscape Scroll" was completed in 1486 (the twenty-second year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty, the eighteenth year of Civilization in Japan). It was a work by Sesshū at the age of sixty-seven, nearly twenty years after his return to Japan. It is very possible that the landscape of Zhejiang with West Lake in Hangzhou as the focus—that is, the realistic basis for the birth of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui's landscape paintings—has been accumulated in the old man's mind for a long time, so it is inevitable that it is often seen in his brush. It is also possible that the handling of certain parts may be a memory of the scenery of West Lake. This is precisely the extraordinaryness of the painter. Because an excellent and successful landscape painting is by no means a topographic sketch, but should not only give nature a vivid image but also give nature a rich content. As for the theory of "picture scroll," a form that the Japanese people traditionally love, its completion is not only an outstanding work of the Muromachi period but should be regarded as the development and improvement of the Japanese "picture scroll." It can also be regarded as the rebirth of the Japanese "picture scroll."

Sesshū's creative methods as the one who completed Japanese ink landscape painting—the expression forms and expression techniques—are also diverse, and everything starts from the content. For example, "Amanohashidate Map"⑨, which depicts one of the three scenic spots in Japan, and "Chinda Falls Map"⑩, a famous scenic spot in Kyushu, are both masterpieces of realistic subjects, but the forms and techniques of expression are different, one with light ink and light mist, sparkling waves and clouds; the other with a rainbow flying thousands of feet and rugged mountains and rocks. For example, "Mount Fuji, Miho, and Seiken-ji Temple"? and "Seiken-ji Temple"?, both use the majestic and solemn Mount Fuji, which symbolizes the soul of Japanese culture, as the main component of the picture. Their descriptions do not indiscriminately adopt the texture method of the axe-cut system but start from the needs of the content and use softer lines and ink-rendering techniques to create the majestic posture of the towering Mount Fuji.

Sesshū's outstanding achievements in landscape painting are not limited to this. He also highly mastered and developed the techniques of splashing ink and abbreviated brushwork. Like the "Broken Ink Landscape" collected by the Tokyo National Museum and the Ono, Kikuya, and Sumitomo families, all are exquisite works with elegant, clear, and distant artistic conceptions. Only when ink landscape painting reaches this realm is it possible to climb the peak of art.

Sesshū's figure paintings also give people a novel and powerful feeling very well. He skillfully drove a variety of expression forms to vividly depict the identities, temperaments, and inner worlds of different characters.

Sesshū's figure paintings can be roughly divided into two categories: one is portrait paintings, which are basically descriptions of real people, and the other is religious themes and Chinese historical stories. A typical work representing the former is "Portrait of Masuda Kanetaka"? This is a pure "Yamato-e" style so-called "national style portrait painting" that conveys the image of Masuda Kanetaka, the general of Ōuchi. In the past, some people suspected whether it was Sesshū's work, but the more important thing about Sesshū, the outstanding landmark painter, is that he is the inheritor and developer of the excellent traditions of national painting. A typical work representing the latter is "Huike Cutting His Arm"? This is a story depicting how Bodhidharma arrived in China (Mount Song, Henan) in the 30s of the sixth century, and Huike, who was later honored as the "Second Ancestor," stood in the snow in the severe cold and cut off his arm with a sharp blade to seek the Dharma. The painter profoundly shaped Bodhidharma, the "founder" of Zen Buddhism, and placed him in the rocky valley, his spirit was so detached; and Huike, half-buried in the snow, holding infinite determination, was so sincere and devout, holding his severed arm and standing behind Bodhidharma. They seemed to be speechless to each other, but they vividly and tensely revealed a tragic and touching scene. While depicting such a tenacious, unwavering, and repentant theme character, the painter used lines like the force of ten thousand jun (broad and unrestrained brushwork). This bold treatment is unprecedented in the history of painting. The so-called "vajra pestle at the tip of the brush" that Chinese painters aspire to, I think is nothing more than this. This is truly one of the most wonderful masterpieces in the world of religious painting.

As for flower and bird paintings, although they are not the main focus of Sesshū's creative life, a study of the few well-documented works also has amazing achievements and powerfully aroused the climax of colored flower and bird screen paintings in the Momoyama period and thereafter. For example, the "Four Seasons Flower and Bird Screen" of six panels each pair collected by the Maeda Ikutokukai and Mr. Kosaka Junzo? are wonderful examples.

These two pairs of screens are paper-based colored meticulous flower and bird paintings (in addition, there are some ink and abbreviated flower and bird works). As for this type of flower and bird works, it should be particularly pointed out that they have unique gorgeous decorative qualities. Like his landscape paintings, they are also closely combined with the preferences of the Japanese people, and a few flower and bird creations lead us into another beautiful world where the four seasons are like spring and full of vitality. Like the pair of screens collected by the Maeda Ikutokukai, according to the information, it was a work by Sesshū at the age of seventy-one in 1490 (the third year of Hongzhi in the Ming Dynasty, the second year of Entoku in Japan). In this work, the painter portrayed the different beauties of the four seasons with all kinds of sights, and while adopting pine, bamboo, and plum (Chinese call them the three friends of winter) as the main components, symbolizing the noblest qualities in the spiritual realm of the two peoples, he arranged double cranes, flying sparrows...; arranged spring flowers, summer lotus, autumn grass, and winter plums; arranged waterfalls after rain to snow in severe winter; such a lively, rich, and colorful picture brings people infinite beauty and hope.

In general, Sesshū's immortal art presents the world with a beautiful artistic conception of vigor, freshness, peace, and happiness, embodies the common feelings and wishes of the people of China and Japan, and has set a brilliant example in history for the cultural dissemination among human beings, especially among Asian countries.

Note: ① "Gekokujo" means the lower ruling the upper, which was originally an idiom in Japan since ancient times. This sentence was particularly popular in the Muromachi period. Because the samurai class surpassed the nobility, and the "Kanrei" were not bound by the samurai; on the other hand, the broad masses of the people everywhere had "rebellions."

### 雪舟及其艺术

专栏：

    雪舟及其艺术
    傅抱石
    家住蓬莱弱水湾，丰姿潇洒出尘寰，
    久闻词赋超方外，剩有丹青落世间，
    鹫岭千层飞锡去，鲸波万里踏杯还；
    悬知别后相思处，月在中天云在山。
    这是1469年（明成化五年，日本文明元年）四月，日本画家雪舟由宁波回国的时候，诗人徐琏送别的一首诗。我们从这首诗里面亲切地感觉到诗人画家的翰墨因缘之中蕴藏着极其真诚的友情。
    雪舟是日本划时代的画家，是日本水墨画特别是水墨山水画的完成者。他卓越的成就，不但标志着十五世纪日本绘画永远令人景仰的高度，更重要的是，通过他非凡的才能和忘我的劳动，在水墨苍劲、减笔泼墨的表现基础上，创造性地结合着日本人民的思想感情，终于出色地形成了自己的民族风格，继承并发展了日本民族绘画的优秀传统，丰富了日本的文化内容。日本人民一致尊崇他为“千古之一人”、“古今之画圣”，这是完全可以理解的，也是非常自然的。
    在最堪珍视的中日两国文化往来的悠久历史中，光辉地体现着两国人民亲密无间、水乳交融的精神的，造型艺术应是比较突出的一个部门，而造型艺术之中又莫如绘画，尤其是水墨画。在日本绘画史上，达到这个光辉顶点的，便是雪舟。
    雪舟是今年世界和平理事会号召今年纪念的世界文化名人之一。我怀着无比亲切、无比向往和无比崇敬的心情，就雪舟及其不朽的艺术，试加回顾，借以表达纪念之热忱于万一。
    雪舟成长于日本中世武家政权和贵族矛盾斗争剧烈的室町时代（1333—1573）。这个时代是：到处发生“叛乱”，足利氏幕府始终处于紧张应付、焦头烂额的所谓“下克上”①的时代；同时，这个时代又是：继承着镰仓时代（1192—1333）所输入的宋元文化特别是水墨画——这一中日人民所育成的美丽矫健的花朵，在日本的土壤上开花结子的时代。
    原来，日本绘画自镰仓时代晚期以来，陷于形式的佛画和根源于贵族文化，仅仅从事于说明性或记录性的“大和绘”（主要是绘卷物），已经大大不能满足新时代的需要，代之而起的获得广泛的爱好和尊崇的是淋漓苍劲的水墨画，特别是水墨山水画。元僧一山一宁、良铨的赴日，和日本默庵灵渊、铁舟德济、梦窗国师……乃至明兆、如拙、周文诸名僧的努力，都给日本水墨画的发展，作出了巨大的贡献。特别是如拙和周文两位杰出的画家，对雪舟的艺术具有极其重要的桥梁作用。
    雪舟姓小田（—说出藤原氏），名等杨，号雪舟，又号备溪斋、渔樵斋、米元山主、云谷轩等，或称雪舟等杨，或称等杨雪舟。还有以杨为姓称为杨雪舟或杨知客的。为什么名“等杨”呢？据山县周南的“雪舟传”说：“盖慕杨补之逃禅耳”。杨补之是我国南宋时代一位爱国主义的大画家。
    1420年（明永乐十八年，日本应永二十七年）雪舟诞生于日本备中国赤备郡赤滨村（今冈山县）。相传十二、三岁时，父亲把他送到附近天台宗的宝福寺出家，可是幼年的雪舟，既不礼佛，也不念经，就是喜欢画画。因为画画，有一次气的老和尚把他绑在柱子上，他却用脚趾蘸着自己的眼泪在地板上画了一只老鼠，结果感动了老和尚，以后就让他画画了。这个故事，到现在还是日本人民津津乐道的。
    以后，雪舟到过贵族势力中心京都的大德寺、相国寺和武家势力中心镰仓的建长寺，不可避免地是从师学禅。到1467年（雪舟四十八岁）为止，这一段时期的具体活动，现在虽还不可能明了，但鉴于他在盛名之后的晚年和将军们一些值得注意的行动（如拒绝大内义兴的恳聘和转介狩野正信为足利义政画壁……等传说），我们可以相信他是一位忠于民族、忠于现实而又忠于艺术的具有远大抱负的画家。
    1468年（明成化四年，日本应仁二年）是日本历史上所谓“应仁之乱”长达十年的大规模内战开始的第二年，雪舟随同以天舆清启为首的“遣明船”来到了中国。首先驻留的是五大禅林之一同时和日本禅宗之祖荣西禅师关系密切的浙江宁波的天童寺，很快就被尊为“首座”，这从雪舟返国以后一些创作上常见的“天童第一座”的题署可以证明。
    雪舟中国之游，为期虽然短暂，却结下了不少令人难忘的翰墨因缘和遗存了不少描写中国山川名胜、历史故事的杰作。他曾应中国友人之请画过日本东海胜景的“富士、三保、清见寺图”，使得当时著名的书画家詹仲和欢喜赞叹而题出“乘风吾欲东游去，特到松原窃羽衣”的热情诗句②。他还画过宁波府、育王寺、西湖、径山寺、扬子江和金山寺，突出地说明了两国艺术家们互相钦慕、互相尊重和互相学习的不可分割的传统友谊。
    雪舟又曾溯运河到过北京，画过“礼部院”中堂的壁画，获得了极高的评价。“尚书姚公……召诸生而指壁上曰：‘是乃日本上人杨雪舟之墨妙，外夷犹有斯绝手，二三子盍各勤尔业，以跻斯域！……’”③，其被推重有如此。
    当雪舟来到中国的时候，中国绘画已经基本上突破了南宋末期所形成的某些固定的形式和风格，开始了一个新的变化——即在水墨苍劲、减笔泼墨的传统基础之上，经由元四家的发展而朝着水墨写意山水的方向迈进。这个客观的事实，摆在对于马远、夏圭、牧溪、玉涧诸家艺术沈潜有得的雪舟面前，就不能不成为一个新的课题。1495年（明弘治八年，日本明应四年）雪舟七十六岁时，在给弟子如水宗渊的“破墨山水”④上题过这样几句话：“余曾入大宋国，北涉大江，经齐鲁郊至于洛求画师，虽然，挥洒清拔之者稀也。于兹长有声⑤、李在二人得时名，相随传设色之旨兼破墨之法矣。数年而归本邦也。……”从这段极其重要的题语中，雪舟对中国之行，由于当时“挥染清拔”的画家很少，似乎还感到一定程度的遗憾。可是“泰华衡岳之为山，江淮河济之为水，草木鸟兽之异，人物风化之殊，是大唐国之有画也；而其泼墨之法，运笔之术，得之心而应之手，在我不在人，是大唐国之无师也”。⑥我们认为，这样来理解雪舟是比较客观的，因而也是比较符合实际的。同时，我们也不能不深深地认为可惜的是雪舟游中国的时间究竟不很充裕，集体旅行究竟不很方便，当时具有一定代表性的几位山水画家：戴文进（进）（1426—1435顷卒）死了；杜东原（琼）（1396—1474）老了；年纪和雪舟差不多的姚云东（绶）（1423—1495顷卒）、沈石田（周）（1427—1507）辈，又无缘晤对。
    雪舟在1469年（明成化五年，日本文明元年）返国以后，曾经定住禅宗中心地之一的丰后国，并筑室名“天开图画楼”。后来，近七十岁了，迁居周防的山口。山口是室町幕府时期一个新兴的城市，他在那儿重新建筑了画室，仍名“天开图画楼”。传说不久，他因为拒绝了封建领主大内义兴的聘请，遭受了迫害被逐出山口而迁居防州，住在石见、益田郡的大喜庵。大约从此就定住这儿，渡过他健康的晚年。
    1506年（明正德元年，日本永正三年）八月，日本划时代的画家雪舟以八十七岁的高龄逝世于石见的大喜庵。今年是他逝世450周年。
    雪舟在绘画上是一位各体俱精，民族风格极为鲜明的大家。根据资料和遗迹看来，我想大约可以这么说：雪舟的画，山水第一，人物次之，花鸟又次之。
    “道释人物，依据唐之吴道子与宋之梁楷；山水树石，或出马远，或入夏圭；水墨淋漓，自具雅趣，西湖僧若芬之流也；扫出云山，惊人耳目，西域僧高彦敬之亚也；水禽山兽，则齐长沙之易元吉；着色花鸟，则类霅溪之钱舜举；龙虎猿鹤，芦雁白鹭，略师法常而去其粗恶，墨鬼钟馗，颇多龚翠岩之怪……”⑦这是出自和雪舟同船到过中国而且过从甚密的杏坞良心的话，对雪舟艺术的渊源及其继承关系作了比较具体和比较全面的分析，当然是一种非常重要的资料。老实说，像这样全能的画家，明代以后中国也还是不多见的。因此，我们很难同意孤立地单单着眼于雪舟的山水作品特别是某些风格上接近南宋水墨苍劲的山水作品，而把雪舟仅仅说成是“北宗画”，或者仅仅说成是追求着中国十五世纪初、中期才有而在当时并没有起主导作用的所谓“浙派”，这些都是缩小并降低雪舟成就的值得研究的看法。
    雪舟的山水画，是日本山水画史上——从作为绘卷物的背景而逐渐脱离之后，最早而又最卓越的完成者。因为以水墨（包括水墨淡彩）为基调的山水画在中国是成熟于十世纪的北宋的，它的发展过程颇为复杂。一般说，通过董元、李成、范宽、米芾、郭熙、李唐诸大家的努力，到了南宋，就形成了马远，夏圭的水墨苍劲和牧溪、玉涧的减笔泼墨的新的风格。他们尤其是马、夏、牧、玉的作品传到了日本之后很快地便受到了热烈的欢迎。经过如拙，周文等努力的吸收融化，特别是雪舟返国以后，将近四十年顽强的艺术劳动，奠定了日本山水画的宏固基础，并从而促成了日本山水画的勃兴。
    “山水图长卷”是雪舟山水画——应该说是他全部遗迹中最有代表性的作品。据我所知，它的规模之大，气象之雄，内容之富，感人之深，的的确确是世界风景名画中足与南宋夏圭“长江万里图”并美的杰作，是日本镰仓时代以来绘画遗产中的瑰宝；是日本画家对世界造型艺术所作出的重要贡献之一。至于“长卷”的这种构成形式（创作的和鉴赏的），原是中日人民所习见所喜爱而又善于利用的形式之一，在中国是盛行于南宋时代，在日本却发展于镰仓时代。但问题的关键并不在这儿。我们从“山水图长卷”富于现实主义精神的位置经营来看，雪舟真是“山河无隔碍，光明处处通”⑧地以中国山川为基调，出其湛深的自然观照和丰富的意境创造，处处紧密地结合着日本人民的爱好，突破了时间和空间的一切限制，尤其是季节、气候的限制，生动地有机地把春、夏、秋、冬各个季节动人的景色，集中在一幅画面。我们认为：这是中国画家所难能而是日本画家所特别擅长的。
    “山水图长卷”完成于1486年（明成化二十二年，日本文明十八年），是雪舟返国近二十年后六十七岁的作品。非常可能，以杭州西湖为重点的浙江山水——也即是诞生马远、夏圭山水画的现实基础，此老既久蓄之于胸中，就不免常见之于笔下。还有可能，某些部分的处理，或即忆写西湖的景色也是未可知的。这正是画家的卓越非凡之处。因为一幅出色的成功的山水画，决不是一张地形写生图，而应该是既要赋自然以生动的形象，又要赋自然以丰富的内容。作为“绘卷物”这一对于日本人民具有传统喜爱的形式论，它的完成，不仅仅是室町时代杰出的作品，应该认为是日本“绘卷物”的发展和提高。也可以认为是日本“绘卷物”的新生。
    日本水墨山水完成者雪舟的创作方法——表现形式和表现技法，又是多种多样、一切从内容出发的。如描写日本三景之一的“天桥立图”⑨和九州名胜的“镇田瀑布图”⑩，都是现实题材的杰作，而表现的形式技法就各各不同，一则淡墨轻岚，波光云影；一则虹飞千尺，山石嶙峋。又如“富士、三保、清见寺图”?和“清见寺图”?，都是以雄伟庄严象征日本文化灵魂的富士山为画面的主要构成部分，它们的描写就没有不加选择地采用斧劈系统的皴法而是从内容的需要出发，使用着较为柔软的线条和水墨渲淡的手法创造了巍然的富士的雄姿。
    雪舟在山水画方面卓越的成就还不止此，他还高度地掌握并发展了泼墨减笔的技法。像东京国立博物馆及小野、菊屋、住友诸氏所藏的“破墨山水”，无一不是淡雅清远别具意境的佳构。水墨山水到此境界，才有可能攀登艺术的高峰。
    雪舟的人物画，也十分出色地给人以新颖而有力的感觉，他曾极其熟练地驱使着多种多样的表现形式，生动地刻划着不同人物的身份、气质及其内心世界。
    雪舟的人物画大致可以分为两大类：一类是肖像画，基本上是现实人物的描写，一类是宗教题材和中国的历史故事。代表前者的典型作品是“益田兼尧像”?。这是一幅传写大内的将军益田兼尧的纯粹“大和绘”式的所谓“国风肖像画”，过去还有些人怀疑它是不是雪舟的作品，殊不知杰出的划时代的画家雪舟更重要的就在于他是民族绘画优秀传统的继承者和发展者。代表后者的典型作品是“慧可断臂图”?。这是一幅描写六世纪三十年代达摩到了中国（河南嵩山），后来被尊为“二祖”的慧可，冒着严寒屹立雪中以利刃断臂求法的故事。画家极其深刻地塑造了禅宗“始祖”的达摩，把它置于岩壑之中，精神是那么超然；而半身埋在雪里抱着无限决心的慧可，又是那么诚恳、虔敬，擎着断臂，站在达摩的背后，他们彼此似是无言，而却十分生动地紧张地揭示出一幅悲剧性的感人的画面。画家在刻划这样一位坚韧不拔九死无悔的主题人物的同时，使用了犹如万钧之力的线条（阔大奔放的笔法），这种大胆的处理，是画史上没有前例的。中国画家所向往的所谓“笔端金刚杵”，我想也不外如是。这真是世界宗教画中无比精彩的杰作之一。
    至于花鸟画，在雪舟的创作生活里虽然不是主要的，但就流传有绪的少数作品研究，也同样地具有惊人的成就，并有力地激起了桃山时代及其以后着色花鸟屏风的高潮。例如前田育德会和小坂顺造氏所藏的“四季花鸟屏风”各六曲一双?，便是精彩的例子。
    这两双屏风都是纸本着色工笔钩勒的花鸟画（另外，还有些水墨减笔的花鸟作品）。作为这一类型的花鸟作品，特别应该指出的是它们所独有的绚烂多彩的装饰性。和他的山水画一样，也紧紧地结合了日本人民的爱好，在为数很少的花鸟创作把我们引入了另一个四时如春、生气盎然的美丽世界。像前田育德会藏的那双屏风，据资料是1490年（明弘治三年，日本延德二年）雪舟七十一岁时的作品。画家在这一作品上，气象万千地刻划了四季不同的美景，采取了象征两国人民精神领域中最高贵品质的松、竹、梅（中国称它们为岁寒三友）为主要构成的同时，配置了双鹤、飞雀……；配置了春花、夏荷、秋草、冬梅；配置了雨后的瀑布到严冬的积雪；这样生动活泼丰富多彩的画面，给人们带来了无限的美好和希望。
    总的说来，雪舟不朽的艺术对世界提出了刚健、清新、和平、幸福的美的意境，体现了中日两国人民共同的感情和愿望，在历史上为人类特别是亚洲各国间的文化流播，树立了光辉的榜样。
