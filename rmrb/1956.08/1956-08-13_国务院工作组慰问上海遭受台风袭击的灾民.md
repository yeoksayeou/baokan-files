Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: A working group dispatched by the State Council spent two consecutive days, the 9th and 10th, in Shanghai extending condolences to flood victims.

The working group visited families in the Jiariqiao shantytown area of Luwan District, the hardest-hit area, conveying the State Council's concern for them and listening to the victims' requests for solutions to their living difficulties. When the working group visited the shantytown area of Pingmin Houcun in Putuo District, they were very pleased to see that the residents of Pingmin Houcun had organized their own disaster relief team, which was building new houses for victims such as Wang Xiuying. They encouraged them to fully mobilize the masses and continue to use mutual aid methods to repair damaged houses.

The working group also extended condolences to the Xietu New Village residents' rescue team in Luwan District, which had actively carried out rescues during the typhoon, and to Wang Ruidi, a resident who was seriously injured in the rescue. During the visit, the working group listened carefully to their requests and opinions.

After completing its work in Shanghai, the working group left for Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 10th to continue its work.
