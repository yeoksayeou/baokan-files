Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The National Wage Conference for Newly Joint State-Private Enterprises concluded today after fourteen days.

This conference, based on the "Decision of the State Council on Wage Reform," determined that the wage system of enterprises that have implemented joint state-private ownership and fixed interest rates after the full industry joint state-private ownership should be reformed in the second half of this year. At the same time, it conducted detailed research on the reform's direction, wage system, wage treatment for private personnel, and disguised wages.

The conference believes that in the more than six months since the establishment of the new joint state-private enterprises, production and business conditions have greatly improved. However, the original chaotic and unreasonable wage situation has become an obstacle to further improving production and implementing the principles of socialist management. The wage system of these enterprises should be reasonably adjusted based on the principle of "to each according to his work," and appropriate steps should be taken based on the actual situation to gradually achieve unification and rationality. The conference requested that, through this wage reform, the wage system within the new joint state-private enterprises can achieve basic unification and rationality, and the large disparities in wages between industries, within industries, and among various types of personnel can be improved.

The conference determined that the wage standards and wage system of the new joint state-private enterprises should gradually align with state-owned enterprises in the same region, with the same nature, and with similar equipment and technical levels. The current wage standards of workers, staff, and private personnel in the new joint state-private enterprises should be compared with the wage standards of state-owned enterprises of the same nature in the local area. Those that are higher will not be lowered, and those that are lower will be gradually increased in stages based on the enterprise's production, business conditions, and actual possibilities. The portion of the current wage standard that is higher than the newly set wage standard will be retained. The retained wages will be gradually offset in the future with wage standard increases and promotions.

Regarding the treatment of private personnel in the new joint state-private enterprises, the conference believes that they should be treated according to the same principles as employee wages. When evaluating their wages, in addition to their current position and work ability, their technical ability and management experience should also be considered, and their current wage level should be appropriately taken into account. For small business owners who originally did not have a fixed income, their wages should be evaluated based on their current position and work ability, while also appropriately considering their original labor income.

Regarding disguised wages, the conference believes that their nature should be distinguished, and they should be handled separately and in order, based on the actual situation of each enterprise. Those that have been cancelled will not be restored. Those that are of a welfare nature should be retained, and those with unreasonable methods should be improved. Some disguised wage benefits can be gradually replaced by establishing reasonable systems, and some can be partially or fully incorporated into the wage standard.

Because the original wage situation of the new joint state-private enterprises was quite chaotic and unreasonable, it is not possible to achieve complete rationality through one reform. Therefore, the conference particularly emphasized that political education for employees should be strengthened during the wage reform process.

The conference requested that all regions quickly formulate wage reform plans for new joint state-private enterprises in their respective regions and submit them to the State Council for approval. The conference also determined that regardless of when the new wage plan is announced, the portion of the newly set hourly wage standard that is higher than the current wage will be retroactively paid from July 1st of this year.

Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yun participated in the last two days of the conference, discussed with the representatives attending the conference, and gave instructions.

    全国新合营企业工资会议结束
    决定改革合营企业的工资制度
    新华社19日讯　全国新公私合营企业工资会议历时十四天，在今天闭幕。
    这次会议，根据“国务院关于工资改革的决定”，确定对全行业公私合营以后实行公私合营并已定股定息的企业的工资制度，在今年下半年进行一次改革，同时对改革的方针、工资制度、私方人员的工资待遇、变相工资等问题作了详细研究。
    会议认为，新公私合营企业半年多以来，生产、营业情况已有很大改善，但是原有的混乱不合理的工资状况，成为进一步提高生产和贯彻执行社会主义经营管理原则的障碍。对这些企业的工资制度，既要根据按劳付酬的原则作合理调整，又要从实际出发，采取适当的步骤，使之逐步达到统一合理。会议要求经过这次工资改革，使新合营企业内部的工资制度能够达到基本上统一合理，行业之间、行业内部以及各类人员之间的工资悬殊的状况能够有所改善。
    会议确定，新合营企业的工资标准和工资制度，应该逐步向同一地区、性质相同、设备与技术水平相近的国营企业看齐。新合营企业的工人、职员和私方人员的现行工资标准，同当地同类性质国营企业的工资标准相比较，高了的不降低，低了的根据企业生产、营业情况和实际可能，分期地逐步增加。现行工资标准高于新定工资标准的部分予以保留。保留的工资，今后随着提高工资标准和升级，逐步抵消。
    关于新合营企业中的私方人员的待遇，会议认为应该按照职工工资的同样原则处理。在评定他们的工资的时候，除了按照现任职务和工作能力以外，还要考虑到他们的技术能力和经营管理经验，并且适当照顾他们的现行工资水平。对于原来没有固定收入的小业主，应该根据他们的现任职务和工作能力，同时适当考虑他们原来的劳动收入情况来评定。
    对于变相工资，会议认为应该区别性质，分别先后，并且根据各企业的实际情况处理。已经取消的不再恢复。属于福利性质的，应该保留，办法不合理的加以改进。有些变相工资待遇，可以逐步地建立合理的制度来代替，有些可以部分或全部并入工资标准。
    因为新合营企业原有工资状况相当混乱不合理，还不可能经过一次改革使之达到完全合理，因此会议特别强调指出，在工资改革过程中，要加强对职工进行政治教育。
    会议要求各地迅速制定本地区新公私合营企业的工资改革方案，报国务院批准。会议又确定，新的工资方案不管什么时候宣布，新定计时工资标准高于现行工资的部分，一律从今年七月一日起补发。
    国务院副总理陈云参加了最后两天的会议，和出席会议的代表一起讨论，并且作了指示。
