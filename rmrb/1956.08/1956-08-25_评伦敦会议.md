    Commentary on the London Conference

    The London Conference discussing the Suez Canal issue concluded on August 23rd. As expected, due to inherent flaws in the way the conference was convened and the composition of its members, the London Conference did not and could not provide a legitimate and reasonable solution to the Suez Canal issue. However, the attempt by the United States, Britain, and France to use the London Conference to promote their "international control" plan has failed. The conference did not make any resolutions or issue any communiqués. It merely sent the conference records to the Egyptian government. No one has fulfilled any obligations of the conference, nor is anyone bound by it.

    It should be pointed out that the London Conference was not entirely meaningless for resolving the Suez Canal issue. During the conference discussions, the basic principles that should be followed in resolving the Suez Canal issue have been recognized to varying degrees. This is extremely important for further seeking ways to solve the problem. The basic principles that have been recognized are:

    *   Acknowledging Egypt's complete right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company;
    *   Ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal as an international waterway;
    *   Any solution must respect Egypt's sovereignty;
    *   Solutions to the problem must be sought through peaceful negotiations rather than threats of force.

    If the London Conference could reach an agreement on specific measures and steps based on these recognized principles, it would open the way for further discussions with Egypt and other relevant countries. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and Ceylon made great efforts at the conference based on these principles, putting forward positive proposals that fully respected Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. Their joint efforts had a positive impact on the development of the conference and the future resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

    On the other hand, although the United States, Britain, and France also verbally acknowledged these principles, their specific proposals effectively negated these principles. They attempted to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty, seize control of the Suez Canal's management, revive the old Suez Canal Company in disguise, and nullify Egypt's nationalization of the canal company. They also openly clamored at the conference to use force as a last resort, attempting to coerce Egypt into submitting to them. The stubborn and selfish intentions of the United States, Britain, and France hindered the London Conference from achieving positive results.

    Another important significance of the London Conference lies in the fact that it demonstrated the irresistible spirit of the times. Opposing colonialism, upholding sovereignty and independence; opposing militarism and threats of war, upholding peaceful consultation; this is the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit," this is the spirit of the times. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and Ceylon were precisely representing this spirit at the conference, speaking out for justice. It was this spirit of the times that caused the United States, Britain, and France to suffer setbacks on procedural issues at the beginning of the conference, forcing them to abandon their originally stipulated agenda and the rule of majority voting. It made them have to acknowledge the basic principles for solving the problem, and cover up and conceal their "international control" plan. It made them unable to realize their attempt to have the London Conference rubber-stamp their plan, and even unable to get those who supported them to sign and endorse the plan.

    The entire process of the London Conference made it clear that the United States is the most staunch supporter of colonialism. Although the United States made all kinds of conciliatory gestures before and during the conference, pretending to respect Egypt's sovereignty, it took the lead in attacking Egypt's sovereignty at the conference table, which in effect was an attack on all people who are striving for independence and opposing colonialism. And some Asian and African countries have actually forgotten the "Bandung Spirit" and provided flank cover for the US-initiated offensive. This situation is indeed regrettable, but what should especially alert the Asian and African people is that in the struggle of the Asian and African people for a common destiny, the imperialists' divide-and-rule strategy is the most insidious enemy.

    Now that the London Conference has ended, the resolution of the problem is still quite far away. The key to the problem now lies in whether the United States, Britain, and France are willing to change their rigid attitudes. Their current decision to send representatives from five countries to explain the Western "international control" plan to Egypt is actually an attempt to make the Western plan an ultimatum after the failure of the London Conference. At the same time, Britain and France are continuing to increase their military strength in the Mediterranean and are preventing foreign pilots of the Suez Canal from continuing to serve. They are trying to deliberately create difficulties in the navigation of the Suez Canal in order to use it as an excuse for armed provocation and intervention if Egypt refuses the Western plan.

    If the United States, Britain, and France are smart enough, they should recognize the spirit of the times manifested at the London Conference and learn from the lessons of the London Conference. Justice is on Egypt's side. The sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people are on Egypt's side. Any action that offends the Egyptian people will offend the people of Asia and Africa and all people with a sense of justice in the world. This is definitely not beneficial to Western countries. It is impossible to subdue the Egyptian people by force, and if they want to continue to solve the problem through negotiations, the United States, Britain, and France must abandon their intention to infringe on Egypt's sovereignty. Now the opportunity to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue has not been finally lost, and the United States, Britain, and France should honestly conduct peaceful consultations in accordance with the basic principles they verbally acknowledged at the London Conference. If they recklessly rely on force and provoke war, the whole world will never forgive them.

### 评伦敦会议

    评伦敦会议
    讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议已经在八月二十三日结束。正如人们所预料的，由于在会议的召开方式和会议成员等方面存在的先天性的缺陷，伦敦会议没有而且也不可能对解决苏彝士运河问题提供合法和合理的解决办法。但是，美、英、法三国企图利用伦敦会议来推行它们的“国际管制”计划的打算，已经遭到了失败。会议没有作出任何决议，也没有发表什么公报，它仅仅把会议记录送交给埃及政府，无论谁都没有履行会议的任何义务，受到它的任何约束。
    应该指出，伦敦会议对于解决苏彝士运河问题并不是毫无意义的。在会议讨论过程中，关于解决苏彝士运河问题所应该遵循的基本原则，已经得到了大家在不同程度上的承认。这对于进一步寻求解决问题的途径是极为重要的。已经得到承认的基本原则是：
    承认埃及完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有；
    必须保证作为国际通航水道的苏彝士运河的航行自由；
    任何解决办法必须尊重埃及的主权；
    必须通过和平谈判而不是武力威胁来谋求问题的解决。
    伦敦会议如果能够根据这些公认的原则在具体的措施和步骤上求得协议，就能为同埃及和其他有关国家作进一步的讨论打开道路。苏联、印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰根据这些原则，在会议上一起作了极大的努力，提出了充分尊重埃及的主权和尊严的积极的建议。它们的共同努力，对会议的发展和今后对苏彝士运河问题的解决，起了良好的影响。
    另一方面，美、英、法虽然口头上也承认这些原则，但是它们提出的具体建议却在实际上完全否定了这些原则。它们企图侵犯埃及的主权，夺取对苏彝士运河的管理权，变相地复活旧的苏彝士运河公司，使埃及把运河公司国有化的行动化为乌有。它们还在会议上公然叫嚷要以武力作为最后手段，企图胁迫埃及向它们屈服。美、英、法这种顽固的自私打算，阻挠了伦敦会议获得积极的结果。
    伦敦会议的另一个重要意义在于：它显示了不可阻遏的时代精神。反对殖民主义，坚持维护主权和独立；反对黩武主义和战争威胁，坚持和平协商；这就是“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”，这就是时代的精神。苏联、印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰正是代表着这种精神在会议上仗义执言。正是这种时代的精神，使得美、英、法三国在会议一开始的时候就在程序问题上遭到了挫折，被迫放弃了他们原先规定好的议程和多数表决的议事规则。使得它们不得不承认解决问题的基本原则，遮遮掩掩地提出它们的“国际管制”的计划。使得它们不能实现要伦敦会议给它们的计划盖图章的企图，甚至也不能做到使那些支持它们的人在这个计划上签字画押。
    伦敦会议的整个过程使人们看清楚了：美国是殖民主义的最坚决的支持者。尽管美国在会前和会中做尽了各种和缓的姿态，装出一副尊重埃及主权的面孔，但是在会议桌上它却带头向埃及的主权进攻，实际上也就是向一切争取独立、反对殖民主义的人民进攻。而某些亚非国家竟然忘记了“万隆精神”，在美国发起的这个进攻中给它作了侧翼掩护的工作。这个情况诚然使人感到遗憾，但是尤其应该引起亚非人民警惕的是：在亚非人民为共同命运而进行的斗争中，帝国主义的分而治之的策略，是最阴险不过的敌人。
    现在伦敦会议已经结束，但是离开问题的解决仍然相当遥远。目前问题的关键就在于美、英、法是否肯改变它们僵硬的态度。它们现在决定派遣五国代表，去向埃及说明西方的“国际管制”计划，实际上是想在伦敦会议失败以后，通过这种方式使西方的计划带有最后通牒的性质。同时，英、法正在继续向地中海增强兵力，并且阻挠苏彝士运河的外籍领港员继续服务。它们企图故意制造苏彝士运河通航的困难，以便在埃及拒绝西方计划时作为进行武装挑衅和干涉的借口。
    美、英、法如果有足够的聪明的话，就应当认识到伦敦会议上所表现出来的时代精神，记取伦敦会议的教训。正义在埃及这一边。亿万人民的同情和支持在埃及这一边。任何足以触怒埃及人民的行动，都将触怒亚非两洲和全世界一切有正义感的人。这对西方国家决不是有利的。要用武力来使埃及人民屈服是办不到的，而如果想继续通过谈判来解决问题，美、英、法就必须放弃侵犯埃及主权的打算。现在和平解决苏彝士运河问题的机会还没有最后丧失，美、英、法应该老老实实地按照它们在伦敦会议上口头承认的基本原则，来进行和平协商。如果它们竟然凭恃武力，挑起战端，全世界将决不会宽恕它们。
