A Call for Chengdu's Handicraft Industry
Wang Yi

(I)
Chengdu's handicraft products have always enjoyed a high reputation. Their characteristics are fine workmanship, diverse designs, and affordable prices. The colorful Shu brocade, comfortable and durable Mao Bian cloth shoes, and exquisite bamboo, rattan, and palm fiber utensils have always been sold well both inside and outside the province.

During the upsurge of socialist transformation across the country, more than 14,000 handicraft households in 20 industries in the city formed 263 cooperatives and cooperative groups. Nearly 34,000 members participated in the cooperatives (groups), accounting for 95% of the city's handicraft workers. From then on, Chengdu's handicraft workers embarked on a new path.

After being organized, the creativity and labor enthusiasm of the handicraft workers increased significantly. From February to June this year, nearly 1,100 new products were added. The rework rate of the leather manufacturing industry dropped from 10.25% in March to 3% in June, and the defect rate dropped from 3.99% to 0.28%. The labor productivity of the sewing industry increased by more than 22% in May compared to April. The cost of many products has also been reduced accordingly.

Like the situation in other parts of the country, after the overall cooperation of the handicraft industry in Chengdu, the most important issue currently is how to open up a broad road for further development of production; and to improve the difficult living conditions of handicraft workers in all aspects. These two issues are the hallmarks of the superiority of cooperation. To solve these two problems, the cooperation and mutual assistance of commercial cooperation departments, agricultural production leadership departments, and financial and taxation departments are necessary. Whoever does not value this cooperative and mutual assistance relationship is essentially not valuing the country's planned economy, and the result will be that planned economy is worse than no plan.

(II)
After the cooperation of handicraft workers in Chengdu, the production and sales situation has undergone great changes. The total value of production in 1956 is planned to increase by 34.56% compared to 1955. Currently, there are too many orders for furniture manufacturing, and production tasks have already been arranged for 1957; although the labor productivity of the sewing industry has been greatly improved, it still takes half a month to twenty days to wait in line to get a suit of clothes made. Products from other cultural supplies, machinery repair, and silk weaving industries are also in short supply.

After the scattered individual handicraft workers are organized, they face such a new market situation, and the management work often cannot keep up with the needs of the situation. New difficulties and shortcomings in the work are naturally inevitable, which need to be solved by the Chengdu handicraft management department. However, the most serious problem in Chengdu's handicraft production at present is still the insufficient supply of raw materials. Many industries are underutilized or shut down waiting for materials. Since the production situation cannot proceed normally, it is of course difficult to start other reform work.

The insufficient supply of raw materials is primarily related to the poor connection of production plans between departments. Chengdu's handicraft industry needed 180 tons of steel in the second quarter of this year, but only about 75% was supplied (including scrap steel supplied by the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives). Only about 70% of the silkworm silk needed last year was supplied. Although the raw materials for manufacturing brocade and velvet have been basically satisfied this year, the raw materials for silk thread cooperatives are still short by more than half. And these raw materials can be supplied locally in Sichuan. At present, there are 70 local iron smelting plants in the province, which are planned to produce 192,000 tons of iron in 1956. After making full use of existing equipment and appropriately expanding production, it is planned that the annual production level can reach 400,000 tons in 1962. As for silkworm silk, it is one of Sichuan's main export commodities. In 1925, the year with the highest output in history, Sichuan Province produced 716,000 dan, but only 262,000 dan were produced last year. Why has the potential of these raw material productions not been well exploited? This is inseparable from the failure to give full play to local initiative. If local small iron plants could have received national support earlier, if the China Silk Company did not set the purchase price of silkworm silk too rigidly (currently, Sichuan silkworm silk is 30.12% lower than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and 27.5% lower than that of Anhui and Shandong), if a little more could be left for local use when silkworm silk is allocated for export, or if it could be processed by local handicrafts before being exported... if this could be done, the production of raw materials would increase significantly, which would not harm the country in any way, and the local handicraft production would be saved.

Another reason for the insufficient supply of raw materials is completely man-made accidents. The castor oil needed by Chengdu's handicraft industry was originally supplied by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Native and Subsidiary Food Wholesale Department. At the end of March, it was transferred to the Municipal Oil Company. Due to unclear handover, the Oil Company did not prepare the supply, resulting in the shutdown of the chemical production cooperative waiting for materials. Another example is horse tails, cow tails, human hair, and wool, which were previously purchased by private merchants in Xichang, Kangding, and other places. Now they are supplied by the Animal Products Company, resulting in the interruption of the source of goods and the inability to connect the supply. Cadres of the Chengdu Bone, Horn, and Hair Production Cooperative also told me another situation: at present, their raw materials can only meet 50% of their needs. This is not because there are no bones and horns in nearby counties. He said: Not long ago, they sent people to Santai County and found that the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative had thousands of kilograms of bones and horns in storage. However, they must have a letter of introduction from the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives to purchase and transport them. This means that although the State Council stipulates that handicraft cooperatives can purchase raw materials locally, the "blockade" between regions and between departments has not been eliminated.

The above-mentioned phenomena should be overcome quickly. Otherwise, it will produce the following result: everyone is shouting about planning, but everyone is also destroying the plan.

(III)
The lives of handicraft workers in Chengdu are very hard. Before liberation, the salary of an ordinary worker was only seven or eight sheng of rice per month. After liberation, the situation changed, but at present, the wages of most workers are still low. According to a survey of 176 production cooperatives and more than 23,000 workers in Chengdu, 21.77% of workers earn less than 20 yuan per month, 52.51% earn 20 to 30 yuan, 23.31% earn 30 to 40 yuan, 2.19% earn 40 to 50 yuan, and only 0.22% earn more than 50 yuan per month. According to Chengdu's standard of living, if you earn 20 yuan a month, you cannot take care of family life in addition to your own life.

As for the original small business owners, some of their incomes are not as good as before. There is an old toothbrush brand, Liu Changshun, which used to take several apprentices, have a small storefront, and do a little wholesale business. Now there are only the old man, his daughter-in-law, and his grandson, a total of three generations and three people. The old man is 76 years old, his eyes are blurred, he does not do much work, and he has to rely on practicing medicine to supplement his family, and he has not participated in the cooperative. The main labor relies on the daughter-in-law and grandson. At present, the monthly income from making toothbrushes is only a dozen yuan, and the life is not as good as before.

Production is developing rapidly, but why is life still so difficult?

One of the reasons is that some cooperatives have quotas that are too high, or the processing fees are too low. The department store stipulates that the embroidery processing fee is 1.2 jiao per thousand stitches, and each person can only do more than 2,000 stitches per day, earning about 3 jiao. Yang Jingxian, a member of the embroidery cooperative, earns 6 yuan a month, sometimes eats only one meal a day, and is often uneasy and wants to change jobs.

Secondly, the public accumulation of cooperatives is too much, and the income of members is naturally reduced. In the third woodware cooperative, the average wage of members in the second quarter of this year was more than 27 yuan, while the average monthly accumulation was 17.3 yuan, accounting for 62.07% of the total wage; in the fifth metal cooperative, the average wage in the second quarter was 23.68 yuan, while the average accumulation per person was 8.85 yuan, accounting for 37.36% of the total wage. These accumulation plans are obviously too rash.

Again, there is the unreasonable distribution of profits between handicraft and commerce. According to a survey in Chengdu, the pure profit of a pair of men's leather shoes from the cooperative is 7.8%, and the retail profit of state-owned commerce is 22.8%; the pure profit of a rattan circle chair cooperative is 8.55%, and state-owned commerce is 21%; the pure profit of a canvas rainproof box cooperative is 3.5%, and state-owned commerce is 22.05%... This unreasonable phenomenon of profit distribution affects both the development of production and the income of handicraft workers.

Recently, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have begun to study how to adjust the wage issue of handicraft cooperatives. However, solving the life problem of handicraft workers, like solving the production problem, is a national problem, and various national departments must cooperate. How to increase processing fees and reduce commercial profits, this should be the work of state-owned commercial departments. How to ensure that the vast majority of handicraft workers increase production and increase income based on the principle of "less deduction and more distribution" is an important policy that the central handicraft management department should study. And this work is inseparable from the plan of the national financial department. If everyone does not move, relying solely on local solutions is powerless.

    为成都市的手工业呼吁
    王揖
    （一）
    成都市的手工业产品，素来享有盛名。它的特点是作工细、花色多、价钱便宜。五光十色的蜀锦，舒适耐穿的毛边布鞋，精巧玲珑的竹、藤、棕丝器具，都一向行销省内外。
    在全国社会主义改造高潮中，全市二十个行业的一万四千多户手工业者，分别组成了二百六十三个合作社和合作小组。参加合作社（组）的近三万四千名社员，占全市手工业从业人员的95％。成都的手工业者，从此踏上了新生的道路。
    组织起来以后，手工业者的创造精神和劳动热情显著地增长了。今年2月到6月，增加了近一千一百种新的产品。皮革制造业的返工率由3月份的10.25％降至6月份的3％，次品率由3.99％降至0.28％。缝纫业的劳动生产率，5月份比4月份提高了22％以上。很多产品的成本也相应地降低了。
    和全国其他地区的情况一样，成都市手工业全盘合作化以后，当前最重要的问题是如何为进一步发展生产打开广阔的道路；并从各方面改善手工业者艰苦的生活条件。这两个问题，是合作化的优越性的标志。而要解决这两个问题，又必须商业合作部门、农业生产领导部门、财政税收部门的协作互助。谁不重视这种合作互助关系，实质上也就是不重视国家的计划经济，其结果将是有计划比无计划更坏。
    （二）
    成都市手工业者合作化以后，产销情况发生了很大的变化。1956年的生产总值，计划比1955年增加34.56％。目前，家具制造订货太多，生产任务已经安排到1957年去了；缝纫业的劳动生产率虽然已经提高了很多，但要作一套衣服还得排队等半个月到二十天后才能取货。其他文化用品、机械修配、丝织品等行业的产品，也都是供不应求。
    分散的个体的手工业者组织起来以后，又面对着这样一个新的市场情况，经营管理工作往往会赶不上形势的需要，新的困难和工作缺点自然不会少，这是需要成都手工业管理部门努力解决的问题。但是，成都市手工业生产目前最严重的问题，还在原料供应不上。不少行业开工不足，或者停工待料。生产情况既然不能正常进行，其他各项改革工作当然也就很难着手了。
    原料供应不上，首先是和各部门的生产计划衔接不好有关。成都市手工业今年二季度需用钢铁一百八十吨，只供应了75％左右。（包括省联社供应的废钢）去年需用的蚕丝，只供应了70％左右，今年制造锦缎、丝绒的原料虽然已基本上得到满足，但丝线社的原料还缺一半以上。而这些原料都是在四川能就地供应的。目前，全省有地方炼铁厂七十个，1956年计划产铁十九万二千吨，在尽量利用现有设备和适当扩大生产以后，计划在1962年可以达到年产四十万吨的生产水平。至于蚕丝，更是四川出口的主要物资之一，1925年，即历史上产量最高的一年，四川省共产七十一万六千担，但是，去年只生产了二十六万二千担。为什么这些原料生产的潜力没有很好的发挥出来呢？这是和没有很好发挥地方积极性分不开的，如果地方小型铁厂能更早地得到国家的支持，如果中国蚕丝公司对蚕丝收购价格不要规定得太死，（目前四川蚕丝低于江浙30.12％，低于安徽、山东27.5％），如果蚕丝调拨出口的时候，多留一点给地方使用，或者由地方手工业加工后再出口……如果能够这样，原料的生产就会显著增加，对国家没有任何损害，而地方手工业生产也就得救了。
    原料供应不上的另一个原因，则完全是人为的事故。成都市手工业需用的蓖麻油，原来是由省供销社和土产副食品批发部供应，3月底转由市油脂公司负责，由于交代不清，油脂公司没准备货源，结果使化工生产社停工待料。又如马尾、牛尾、人发、羊毛，过去是由私商在西昌、康定等地采购的，现在改由畜产公司供应，结果是货源关系中断了，供应也接不上了。成都市骨角毛生产联社的干部还告诉我另一种情况：目前，他们的原料只能满足需要的50％。这并不是附近各县没有骨角了。他说：不久以前他们派人到三台县，就发现县供销社存放着数千斤骨角。不过一定得有省联社的介绍信才能购运。这就是说，虽然国务院规定了手工业社可以就地采购原料，但是地区之间，部门与部门之间的“封锁”仍未消除。
    上述这些现象，都是应该迅速克服的。否则，就会产生这样的结果：人人都在高叫计划，但是人人也在破坏计划。
        （三）
    成都市手工业工人的生活是很苦的。解放以前，一个普通工人的工资，每月只不过七、八升米。解放以后，情况有了变化，但是目前绝大部分工人的工资仍然偏低。根据成都市对一百七十六个生产合作社、二万三千多工人的调查，每月收入二十元以下的工人占21.77％，二十元至三十元的工人占52.51％，三十元至四十元的工人占23.31％，四十元至五十元的工人占2.19％，每月收入五十元以上的工人只占0.22％。按照成都的生活水平来说，如果每月收入二十元，除了本人生活而外，就不能兼顾家庭生活了。
    至于原来的小业主，他们的收入有的还不如从前。有一家做牙刷的老字号——刘长顺，从前经常要带几个徒弟，有一间小门面，还作一点批发生意。现在只有老爷子、媳妇和孙儿，三辈一共三口人。老爷子已经七十六岁了，眼睛发花，做活不多，还要靠行医来补助家用，没有参加合作社，主要劳动靠媳妇和孙儿。目前，每月做牙刷收入十几元钱，生活不及从前。
    生产发展得很快，生活为什么还这样困难呢？
    有些合作社的定额偏高，或者是加工工缴太低，这是原因之一。百货公司规定挑绣工缴费为每千针一角二分，而每人每天只能作两千多针，收入三角左右。挑绣社的一个社员杨静先，一个月收入六元，有时全天只吃一顿饭，经常不安心，想转业。
    其次是合作社的公共积累过多，社员的收入自然就减少了。木器合作社第三社，今年二季度社员平均工资是二十七元多，而平均每月的积累达十七元三角，占工资总额的62.07％；金属合作社第五社，二季度平均工资二十三元六角八分，而平均每人积累达八元八角五分，占工资总额的37.36％。这些积累的计划，显然是太冒进了。
    再次，就是手工业和商业利润分配的不合理。根据成都市的调查，有一种男皮鞋，合作社出厂纯利为7.8％，国营商业零售利润为22.8％；藤圈椅合作社纯利为8.55％，国营商业为21％；帆布防雨箱合作社纯利为3.5％，国营商业为22.05％………。利润分配的这种不合理现象，既影响了生产发展，也影响了手工业工人的收入。
    最近，中共成都市委和市人民委员会，已着手研究如何调整手工业合作社的工资问题。但是，解决手工业者的生活问题，和解决生产问题一样，这是一个全国性的问题，必须国家各个部门来配合。如何提高工缴费，降低商业利润，这应该是国营商业部门的工作。如何根据“少扣多分”的原则，保证绝大多数手工业者增加生产和增加收入，这是中央手工业管理部门应该研究的一项重要政策。而这些工作，又和国家财政部门的计划不可分离。如果大家不动起来，只靠地方解决，那是无能为力的。
