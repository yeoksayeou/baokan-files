Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 17th: Since news spread about the intention to declare the German Communist Party illegal, the West German Federal Constitutional Court has received numerous letters and statements protesting this conspiracy by West German reactionary groups.

    The Committee of Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters strongly protested against this anti-democratic conspiracy in Bonn in its letter. It resolutely demanded an end to the persecution of the German Communist Party, which stood at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle during the Hitler regime.

    Former West German citizens living in the Erfurt district of Democratic Germany, representing West German immigrants, wrote to the Federal Constitutional Court saying: We do not want the events of 1933 to be repeated. We know that after the German Communist Party is banned, the persecution of all progressive forces will become more intense.

    Many other organizations and individuals have also opposed the ban on the German Communist Party in various ways.

    The Democratic German Women's Federation sent a telegram to the West German government to protest.

    The Dresden District Organization Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation, representing approximately 700,000 trade union members, called on the Baden-Württemberg State Organization Committee of the West German Trade Union Federation to oppose the ban on the German Communist Party.

    Democratic German National Prize winner and writer Zweig called on all artists to help tear up this criminal plan.

    Municipal councilors in many West German cities, leaders of local Social Democratic Party organizations, and trade union cadres also opposed the ban on the German Communist Party.

    The West German bourgeois newspaper "Mannheimer Morgen" also expressed its protest. It wrote that history tells us that cooperation with communists in domestic and foreign affairs is now more necessary than ever before.
