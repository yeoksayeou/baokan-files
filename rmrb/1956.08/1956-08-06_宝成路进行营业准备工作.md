Xinhua News Agency Report: The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has fully commenced preparations for its official operation. These preparations include adjusting organizational structures, allocating personnel, deploying locomotives and rolling stock, and improving existing lines. In recent days, along the railway line from Baoji, Shaanxi, to Guangyuan, Sichuan, many locomotive crew members from various railway administrations have been driving their beloved locomotives, hauling passenger and freight cars, and arriving successively to participate in the transportation work of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The working base for the future management organization of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—the Chengdu Railway Administration—is also being constructed in large tracts near the Chengdu Railway Station.

In order to promptly open direct transportation services between Sichuan and various parts of the country after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway officially opens, and to prepare for the opening of international through transport, the Chongqing Railway Administration has, on the one hand, opened passenger and freight training classes to allow current cadres to take turns learning the business knowledge of handling direct transportation. On the other hand, it has sent personnel to the international through transport training class held by the Ministry of Railways in Fengtai, Beijing. Other rules, regulations, and management standards are also required to catch up with the national level in the shortest possible time.

    宝成路进行营业准备工作
    据新华社讯　宝成铁路全面开始了正式营业的准备工作。这些工作包括调整组织机构、配备人员、调配机车车辆以及已有线路的改善等。这几天来，从陕西宝鸡到四川广元的铁路线上，有许多来自各铁路管理局的机车乘务人员，驾着自己心爱的机车，拉着客、货车辆陆续前来参加宝成铁路的运输工作。宝成铁路未来的管理机构——成都铁路管理局的工作基地，也正在成都火车站附近成片地修建。
    为了在宝成铁路正式营业后能及时开办四川和全国各地的直达运输，和有准备地开办国际联运，重庆铁路管理局一面开办了客运和货运的训练班，让现职干部轮流学习办理直达运输的业务知识，一面又派人到北京丰台铁道部举办的国际联运训练班学习。其他规章制度和管理水平也要求在最短时期内赶上全国水平。
