Why was a martyr's family beaten? And why no action?
Suo Yunping
There is such a family member of a martyr: she not only did not receive the care, consideration, and respect she deserved, but was instead humiliated and beaten by the district chief, township head, and the township party branch secretary of the area. This persecuted family member of a martyr is Zheng Zhimei of Zhongying Village, Yuezhuang District, Yiyuan County, Shandong.

Why did Zheng Zhimei suffer such a fate? Did she commit any crime? Not at all. It was only because she exposed the mistakes of the cadres, offended their dignity, and therefore suffered retaliation from these cadres.

In the anti-corruption struggle meeting in 1947, Zheng Zhimei exposed that Du Chunjie, the village representative director, had done some things for the enemy when the enemy attacked Shandong, and criticized Du Chunjie for being two-faced and lacking a firm stance. This criticism was completely correct, and Du Chunjie should have examined himself based on these facts. However, Du Chunjie not only did not do so, but used his power to cancel the land tilling on behalf of Zheng Zhimei. Later, Zheng Zhimei had a quarrel with the mistress of the township clerk, Lü Chengde, and Lü Chengde also harbored resentment and planned revenge.

After the wheat harvest in 1949, Zheng Zhimei's family was supposed to pay 30 jin of grain to the state, but because the 300 jin of wheat harvested from the fields had been eaten and there was no other income at the time, she requested the township government to allow her to pay it all in the fall. This request was reasonable. However, Lü Chengde took the opportunity to distort the facts and said to District Chief Zhang Chengyin: "Zheng Zhimei harvested seven or eight hundred jin of wheat and is not paying the public grain." Zhang Chengyin, without investigation or research, detained Zheng Zhimei in the district and forbade anyone to give her food or water. Zheng Zhimei questioned the district chief: "What crime have I committed?" Zhang Chengyin not only did not admit his mistake, but arrogantly scolded Zheng Zhimei's husband, Liu Chenggong, as a "traitor." Zheng Zhimei was a woman of strong character and could not tolerate Zhang Chengyin's insult to her husband, who had sacrificed his life for the revolution, so she retorted to the district chief a few times. As a result, Zhang Chengyin became even more furious, hung Zheng Zhimei up, and personally beat her until her mouth and nose bled. Zheng Zhimei fainted that night because she was severely tortured. It is said that Zhang Chengyin did not know that Zheng Zhimei was a family member of a martyr when he beat her, but regardless of whether he knew it or not, it is a serious violation of law and discipline for a state cadre to beat people. Moreover, when someone told him that Zheng Zhimei was a family member of a martyr, he did not take measures to check and correct himself. This time, Zheng Zhimei was detained for two days and two nights, and she fell ill and became somewhat mentally disturbed after returning home. Zheng Zhimei's body never recovered, and the land was left barren. At this time, Lü Chengde reported to the district cadre Liu Qingli: Zheng Zhimei is confronting the government and not farming the land. Liu Qingli not only did not help solve the problem of tilling on behalf of Zheng Zhimei, but went to Zheng Zhimei's house and insulted her as "shameless" and "acting like a landlord." Zheng Zhimei was forced to beg for a living in the Linqu area. When the newly transferred District Chief Zhang Zhaolun found out, he not only did not show sympathy, but slandered Zheng Zhimei as "deliberately making trouble" and ordered people to tie Zheng Zhimei back home with guns and ropes. Later, Zheng Zhimei went to work as a nanny for the district cadre Wu Jingmei, but Zhang Zhaolun criticized Wu Jingmei for "not approaching good people," and as a result, Zheng was kicked out again.

In 1953, Zheng Zhimei was still unable to cultivate the land and requested the government to send someone to till on her behalf. However, Du Chunjie, the village representative director, scolded her again, and Yan Xiyi, the village party branch secretary, threw her to the ground and dragged her by the legs all the way to the township government, causing the skin on Zheng Zhimei's back to break open and bleed profusely. The township head, Du Bentai, even personally tied Zheng Zhimei to a tree, then fabricated facts and wrote a "accusation" letter, and sent it to the district. District Chief Zhang Zhaolun not only did not ask about the truth, but also thought that the "materials were insufficient" and asked the township to "supplement it further so that it can be sent to the Public Security Bureau." As a result, the township clerk fabricated nine major crimes against Zheng Zhimei, including spreading rumors and sabotage. District Chief Zhang Zhaolun personally interrogated her and detained Zheng Zhimei for three days and three nights, without giving her a grain of rice or a drop of water. Later, Zheng Zhimei's nephew went to the district and begged bitterly, and the district chief allowed her to be released on bail under the supervision of the township. The conditions for bail were: no going out, no sabotage, no going to the market, and reporting when visiting relatives. From then on, a glorious family member of a martyr was controlled like a counter-revolutionary element.

As long as you are a person who loves the revolutionary cause, you will be indignant when you see this. However, the problem is not just that. This case has not been properly handled to this day.

In 1952, when Zheng Zhimei was forced to a dead end, she went to the Yiyuan County People's Court to file a complaint while she was ill. Before that, the Yiyuan County People's Court had received a slander report from the district against Zheng Zhimei. In principle, since the Yiyuan People's Court received two completely opposite reports, it should have conducted in-depth investigation and research to find out the truth, let the wronged people be redressed, and let the lawbreakers be punished by law. However, the Yiyuan County People's Court did not do so. They listened to the report from the district one-sidedly and simply refused to accept Zheng Zhimei's complaint. A staff member of the court even reprimanded Zheng Zhimei. How could this kind of bureaucracy not make the victim suffer injustice?

The Civil Affairs Section of Yiyuan County also sent people to investigate the case in April 1955. Wu Shand, the section chief, repeatedly urged the County People's Procuratorate to handle the case, but Li Xiujiang, the then Procurator General of the Procuratorate, said: "What's the use of you coming to me alone? This case involves a member of the county party committee (Zhang Chengyin has been promoted to a member of the Yiyuan County Party Committee). We can't move him. You should go to the county magistrate!" Originally, the Constitution entrusted the people's procuratorial organs with the solemn responsibility of inspecting whether the staff of state organs abide by the law, but in the eyes of this procurator general, inspection is only for small cadres, and he is "unable to move" big cadres.

The Yiyuan People's Court and the Procurator General were like this, so what about the county magistrate? According to Wu, the head of the Civil Affairs Section: when he found the county magistrate and raised the case, the county magistrate, Dong Qinxiang, not only did not seriously handle the incident, but even hinted that the Civil Affairs Section should not interfere in the matter, which cannot but make people suspect that County Magistrate Dong Qinxiang sympathized with, protected, or supported Zhang Chengyin, and therefore deliberately turned a blind eye?

Finally, it should also be pointed out that the Yiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China also has an insufficiently serious attitude in dealing with this incident. After the Yiyuan County Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China investigated and clarified the truth of the case at the end of 1955, it had put forward opinions on the handling of these cadres who violated laws and discipline. Lü Chengde, one of the principal criminals and the township clerk, has been arrested and brought to justice, but the county committee has delayed for a long time in seriously handling Zhang Chengyin, one of the principal criminals in this case and the former district chief of Yuezhuang District.

The nature of the incident in which Zheng Zhimei, a family member of a martyr, was repeatedly humiliated by cadres and was unable to be redressed for a long time is very serious. The direct criminals in this incident certainly bear great responsibility, and at the same time, the Yiyuan County People's Court, the Yiyuan County People's Procuratorate, the Yiyuan County People's Committee, and even the Yiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, which are responsible for handling this incident, also bear great responsibility. Why are the relevant personnel handling this incident so biased? Why are they so afraid of advocating justice and dare not uphold the truth? Why are they so indulgent to criminals? The criminals in this incident should receive the punishment they deserve, but it is not enough to punish the criminals alone. More importantly, it is necessary to deeply examine the reasons why this incident has not been redressed for a long time. Those subjectivists, bureaucrats, and those who are afraid of personal gains and losses and dare not persist in the struggle must also be seriously dealt with in accordance with different circumstances. In this way, we can achieve the purpose of criticizing mistakes, learning lessons, educating cadres, and improving work.

    为什么吊打烈属？又为什么不处理？
    所云平
    有这样一位烈士家属：她不仅没有得到应有的关怀、照顾、尊敬，反而遭到当地区长、乡长和乡的党支部书记等的凌辱和吊打。这一位被迫害的烈士家属就是山东沂源县悦庄区中营村的郑志美。
    郑志美为什么遭到这样的命运呢？是不是她有了什么罪过呢？完全不是，只是因为她揭发了干部的错误，触犯了这些干部们的尊严，所以遭到了这些干部们的打击报复。
    1947年反贪污斗争会上，郑志美曾揭发了村代表主任杜春杰在敌人进攻山东的时候，给敌人做过一些事情，并批评杜春杰两面逢迎，立场不稳。这一批评是完全正确的，杜春杰理应根据这些事实检查自己，可是，杜春杰不仅没有这样做，反而利用职权，取消了对郑志美的代耕。后来郑志美又同乡文书吕成德的姘妇吵了一架，吕成德也因此怀恨在心，蓄意报复。
    1949年麦收后，郑志美家应缴公粮三十斤，但是因为田里收上来的三百斤小麦已吃光，一时又无其他收入，就要求乡政府准允她到秋后一并缴纳。这样的要求是合理的。但是，吕成德却乘机歪曲事实，对区长张成印说：“郑志美收了七、八百斤小麦，不缴公粮。”张成印既不调查，也不研究，就把郑志美扣押到区里，并且不准任何人给她饭吃和水喝。郑志美质问区长：“我究竟犯了什么罪？”张成印不但没有认错，反而蛮横地骂郑志美的丈夫刘成功是“汉奸”。郑志美是个性情刚强的妇女，不能容忍张成印污辱她为革命献出自己生命的丈夫，就顶撞了区长几句。这一来，张成印就更加大发雷霆，将郑志美吊起来，亲手打得她口鼻流血。郑志美因为受刑过重，当夜就昏迷过去。据说：张成印在吊打郑志美的时候，并不知道郑志美是烈属，但是，不管他知道不知道，身为国家干部打人吊人总是严重的违法乱纪的犯罪行为。何况当别人告诉他郑志美是烈属的时候，他也没有采取措施，检查纠正。这次，郑志美被扣押了两天两夜，回家后就得病，并且神经有些失常。郑志美的身体一直没有复原，土地就荒芜起来。这时，吕成德又向区干部刘庆礼反映：郑志美和政府对抗，不种地。刘庆礼不仅不帮助解决郑志美的代耕问题，反而到郑志美家辱骂她“不要脸”、“地主架子”。郑志美被迫无法，就到临朐一带讨饭度日。这时，新调来的区长张照伦知道后，不但不表同情，反而污蔑郑志美是“故意捣蛋”，叫人携枪带绳将郑志美捆回家来。后来，郑志美去给区干部吴景美当保姆，可是张照伦又批评吴景美“不接近好人”，结果，郑又被撵了出来。
    1953年，郑志美还是无力耕地，要求政府派人代耕。可是，村代表主任杜春杰又把她辱骂一顿，村支部书记彦希义并把她摔倒地上，扯着腿一直拖到乡政府，拖得郑志美背脊上皮开肉裂，鲜血直流。乡长杜本太还亲手把郑志美捆在树上，然后捏造事实，写了一封“控告”信，叫人送到区里。区长张照伦不仅不问清是非，而且嫌“材料不充分”，要乡里“再补充一下，以便送公安局”。于是，由乡文书又给郑志美捏造了造谣、破坏等九大罪状。区长张照伦亲自审讯，又把郑志美扣押了三天三夜，不给他吃一粒米，喝一滴水。后来，郑志美的侄儿到区苦苦哀求，区长才准许取保交乡管制，保释的条件是：不准出门，不准破坏，不准赶集上店，走亲戚要报告。从此，一个光荣的烈士家属，就像反革命分子一样，被管制起来。
    只要你是一个热爱革命事业的人，你看到这里就会激愤。可是，问题还不仅仅这样，这个案件一直拖到现在还没有得到正确的处理。
    1952年当郑志美被逼得走投无路时，就曾经带病到沂源县人民法院去控告，县人民法院在这之前曾接到区里对郑志美的污蔑报告。按理说，沂源人民法院既然接到两种情况完全相反的报告，就应该深入调查研究，弄清事情的真相，让含冤的人伸冤，让违法的人受到法律制裁。可是沂源县人民法院没有这样做，他们偏听偏信了区里的报告，根本不受理郑志美的控告，法院的一个工作人员还把郑志美训斥了一顿。这种官僚主义，怎能不使被害者含冤莫白？
    沂源县民政科为此案件也曾经在1955年4月派人去进行调查，科长吴善德曾数次催促县人民检察院处理此案，可是当时检察院检察长李秀江却说：“你光来找我有什么用？这一案件涉及到县委委员（张成印已提拔为中共沂源县委委员），咱们搬弄不动人家，你还是去找县长吧！”本来，宪法赋予了人民检察机关检察国家机关工作人员是否遵守法律的庄严责任，可是在这位检察长看来，检察只是对小干部而言，对大干部却是“搬弄不动”，无能为力。
    沂源人民法院和检察长如此，县长又怎样呢？据民政科吴科长谈：当他找到了县长，提出这一案件的时候，县长董钦祥不仅没有严肃处理这一事件，竟然暗示民政科不要过问此事，这就不能不使人们怀疑，县长董钦祥是不是同情、包庇或支持张成印，因而故意置若罔闻？
    最后，还应该指出中共沂源县委处理这一事件的态度也是不够严肃的。当中共沂源县监察委员会在1955年年底调查清楚这一案件的真相以后，对于这些违法乱纪的干部，已提出了处理意见，主犯之一的乡文书吕成德已被逮捕法办，但是县委会对这一案件的主犯之一，前悦庄区区长张成印却拖延了很长时期，没有予以严肃认真的处理。
    烈属郑志美受到干部多次凌辱而又长期不得平反的事件的性质是十分严重的。这一事件的直接犯罪分子们固然负有极大责任，同时，负有处理这一事件责任的沂源县人民法院、沂源县人民检察院、沂源县人民委员会以至中共沂源县委会也有极大责任。处理这一事件的有关的人员为什么要如此偏听偏信呢？为什么要如此害怕主张正义和不敢坚持真理呢？为什么对犯罪分子会如此姑息呢？这一事件的犯罪分子应该得到他们应得的惩罚，但是，仅仅惩罚犯罪分子是不够的，更重要的是必须深入检查一下这一事件长期不得平反的原因何在？必须对那些主观主义者、官僚主义者以及顾虑个人得失不敢坚持斗争的人也分别不同情况进行严肃的处理。这样，才能达到批判错误，接受教训，教育干部，改进工作的目的。
