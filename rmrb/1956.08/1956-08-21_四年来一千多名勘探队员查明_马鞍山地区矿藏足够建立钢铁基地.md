    Over a Thousand Explorers in the Past Four Years Confirm
    Mineral Deposits in Ma'anshan Region Sufficient to Establish Steel Base
    (Our newspaper dispatch) After four years of hard work by over a thousand exploration team members, it has been further confirmed that the mineral resources in the Ma'anshan region are sufficient to establish a massive steel base. The reserves of the Aoshan and Gushan iron mines within the territory of Dangtu County alone can meet the needs of large-scale expansion of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant.
    The 803 and 804 exploration teams, responsible for geological exploration in the Ma'anshan area, have discovered rich mineral resources buried in the continuous and undulating mountains of Ma'anshan over the past four years. The reserves of the five major ore bodies that have been explored or are undergoing large-scale exploration are generally tens of millions of tons more than originally estimated. Around these five ore bodies, iron ore has been discovered in four or five mountains. The head of the 804 exploration team said: The iron ore in Zhongshan, Hemushan, Diaoyushan, and Guanyinshan, which are adjacent to the Gushan ore body, is very rich. According to the rock formations and vein trends in this area, it is very likely a complete ore body.
    The iron ore in the Ma'anshan area is not only abundant in reserves but also of good quality and high grade, with an average iron content of over 50% and a maximum iron content of 65%.
    Currently, in the deep mountains centered on Ma'anshan and stretching for hundreds of miles, exploration team members, under the guidance of Soviet experts, are working day and night to conduct general surveys, measurements, geophysical prospecting, trenching, pitting, and drilling. Good news is constantly coming from the mountains: in one ore body, the first drill hit 99 meters of rich iron ore. Not long ago, the geophysical prospecting team discovered an anomalous reflection area of more than 20 square kilometers in Qianshan, not far from Ma'anshan. According to the geophysical prospecting team, this is likely a large ore body, and geological personnel have now been organized to conduct surface surveys on the mountain. The head of the 804 exploration team said with confidence: In the next two years, the amount of mineable iron ore they hand over to the motherland will be more than two and a half times greater than this year.

    四年来一千多名勘探队员查明
    马鞍山地区矿藏足够建立钢铁基地
    本报讯　经过一千多名勘探队员四年来的辛勤劳动，进一步证实马鞍山地区矿产资源足够建立一个巨大的钢铁基地。其中仅当涂县境内的凹山、姑山两个大铁矿的储藏量，就可满足马鞍山铁厂大规模扩建的需要。
    担负着马鞍山地区地质勘探工作的八○三和八○四等勘探队，四年来在马鞍山绵亘起伏的群山中，发现埋藏着丰富的矿产资源。已经探明或正在进行大规模勘探的五个大矿体，铁矿的储量一般都比原先估计的多出几千万吨。在这五个矿体的周围，都有四、五座山发现了铁矿。八○四勘探队负责人说：和姑山矿体毗连着的锺山、和睦山、钓鱼山、观音山的铁矿都很丰富，根据此地的岩层和矿脉走向来看，很可能是一个整的矿体。
    马鞍山地区的铁矿不仅储量丰富，而且质量好、品位高，平均含铁量在50％以上，最高含铁量达到65％。
    目前，以马鞍山为中心绵延数百华里的深山中，勘探队员们在苏联专家的指导下，正在夜以继日地进行着普查、测量、物理探矿和槽探、坑探、钻探等工作。喜讯也不断从山地里传出：有一个矿体打了第一钻，就有九十九公尺是富铁矿。不久前，物理探矿队在距离马鞍山不远的仟山发现一个面积达二十多平方公里的异常反映区。据物理探矿队估计，这里很可能是一个大矿体，现在已组织地质人员上山进行地表调查。八○四勘探队负责人满怀信心地说：在今后两年内，他们向祖国交出的可采铁矿量，将要比今年多两倍半以上。
