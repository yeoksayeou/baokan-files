　　Mr. Shao Lizi introduced Dr. Ye Xichun's tadpole contraceptive prescription at the National People's Congress, which aroused widespread attention. Although both Shao and Ye (Ye's talk appeared in the Hangzhou Daily on July 10) stated that this prescription still needed to be studied by the health department, some newspapers and periodicals believed that it was reliable without a doubt and immediately publicized it to the masses. The magazine "Rural Youth" (No. 14, with a circulation of over 210,000 copies) is one such example. When recommending this "small remedy," the editors not only used a series of "completely effective" and "safe and reliable" phrases, but also included the following embellishments: "Dr. Ye Xichun is seventy-six years old this year, with a completely white beard and eyebrows..."

　　As if this would further increase the reliability of the prescription.

　　Excessively adhering to "observing facial expressions and judging words" can lead to resolving lawsuits and making judgments; "Rural Youth," seeing "completely white beard and eyebrows," responsibly recommended a prescription that "still needs to be studied" to 210,000 farmers (of course, the actual number is more than this). ＊

　　In the office of a leading member of a certain factory, a certain leader was talking with an old comrade-in-arms he hadn't seen for many years. During the conversation, a certain technician came in to ask for instructions on official business. After finishing, the certain technical staff said “thank you”, the attitude was humble and polite.

　　After the door was closed again, the certain leader said to his old comrade-in-arms: "Look, a typical bourgeois ideological style!"

　　This is one example of "typical" simplification of judging people and discussing matters.

    邵力子先生在全国人民代表大会会议上介绍了叶熙春大夫的蝌蚪避孕单方，引起了广泛的注意。虽则邵、叶（叶的谈话见七月十日杭州日报）两位都表示这个单方还需要卫生部门的研究，可是有些报刊却认为它已经可靠无疑，立即向群众宣传起来。“农村青年”杂志（第十四期销数二十一万多册）就是这样。编者在推荐这个“小偏方”时不仅说了一连串的“完全有效”、“稳当可靠”等话，还有这样一些渲染：“叶熙春大夫，今年七十六岁，胡子眉毛全白了……”
    好像这样便更能增加单方的可靠性似的。
    过于执“察颜观色”，便能决狱断案；“农村青年”看见“胡子眉毛全白”，就负责地向二十一万（当然实际不止此数）农民推荐一个“还需要研究”的药方了。＊
    在某工厂的领导人员的办公室里，某领导人在同来访的多年不见的老战友谈话。谈话中间，某技术员进来请示公事，完毕后，某技术人员说了一声“谢谢”，态度是谦恭有理的。
    门重新关上以后，某领导人对他的老战友说：“瞧，典型的资产阶级思想作风！”
    这是看人论事“典型的”简单化之一例。
