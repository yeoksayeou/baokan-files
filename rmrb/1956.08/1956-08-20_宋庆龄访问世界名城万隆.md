Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, August 19th: Residents of Bandung welcomed the distinguished guest from China in the rain on August 18th. Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, admired the beauty of this world-famous city in the twilight under a light drizzle. She was accompanied by the Governor of West Java, Sanusi Hardjadinata, and his wife.

    When Soong Ching Ling's car stopped in front of the historically significant Independence Building, a large crowd suddenly gathered around the car and cheered for her. Governor Hardjadinata led the distinguished guest to visit the podium in the hall. Sixteen months ago, politicians from Asian and African countries announced the famous Ten Principles of the Bandung Spirit on this very podium.

    Later, she met with approximately 300 representatives of overseas Chinese at the office of the local Chinese Association.

    In the evening, Hardjadinata hosted a banquet in honor of Soong Ching Ling at the Governor's residence. At the banquet, he said that mutual understanding between the peoples of Indonesia and China is now becoming more important. He believed that the visit of the distinguished Chinese guest would help enhance the friendship between the two countries.

    Soong Ching Ling replied, "The Chinese people, and the people of Asian and African countries, are all your close friends, or, to be more precise, are all filled with the Bandung spirit. The recent heroic struggle of the Egyptian people to reclaim the Suez Canal is another powerful manifestation of the Bandung spirit." Soong Ching Ling said, "Historically, few cities (no matter how rich or beautiful) have won so many hearts as Bandung has." "Everyone who has visited Bandung misses it, including Premier Zhou Enlai, who often mentions the very pleasant days he spent here. He asked me to convey his greetings to you."

    宋庆龄访问世界名城万隆
    据新华社万隆19日电　万隆居民八月十八日冒雨欢迎来自中国的贵宾。中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄浏览了这个世界著名城市在薄暮时分霏霏细雨下的美景。陪同她的有西爪哇省长萨努西·哈贾韦纳塔和夫人。
    当宋庆龄的汽车停在具有历史意义的独立大厦前面的时候，大批的人突然围聚在汽车周围向她欢呼。哈贾韦纳塔省长引导贵宾参观了大厅的讲台。十六个月前，亚非国家的政治家们就是在这个讲台上宣布了著名的万隆精神十项原则。
    后来，她在这里的华侨协会办事处会见了大约三百名华侨代表。
    晚上，哈贾韦纳塔在省长官邸设宴招待宋庆龄。他在宴会上说，印度尼西亚和中国两国人民之间相互的了解现在变得更加重要了。他相信，中国贵宾的访问将有助于增进两国之间的友谊。
    宋庆龄致答词说：“中国人民、亚非各国人民都是你们的亲密朋友，说得更确切些，都充满着万隆精神。埃及人民最近为了收回苏彝士运河而进行的英勇斗争，是万隆精神的又一次强有力的表现。”宋庆龄说：“历史上还很少有一个城市（不管它多么富足多么漂亮）曾像万隆一样赢得这么多的人心。”“凡是到过万隆的人，都怀念着它，包括周恩来总理在内，他常常提到他在这里渡过的非常愉快的日子。他要求我向你们转达他的问候。”
