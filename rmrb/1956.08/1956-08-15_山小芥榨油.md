    Extracting Oil from Wild Mustard
    (This newspaper report) Our newspaper reported: Workers Liu Duwen and Li Futian from the Licheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Oil Mill in Shanxi Province discovered that a wild grass—wild mustard—can be used to extract oil. Wild mustard, also known as mountain mustard froth, grows in wheat fields, has dense pods, small seeds, and a shiny, oily color. Preliminary tests show an oil yield of 26%, which is half a catty more oil per hundred catties than small hemp, and fifteen and a half catties more oil than soybeans. This oil is edible, tastes very good, and can rival small hemp oil.

    山小芥榨油
    本报讯　山西省黎城县供销社油坊，工人刘都文、李福田发现野草——山小芥可以榨油。山小芥又叫山芥沫，生长在麦田里，角稠密，籽粒小，色泽光而油润。初步试验出油率26％，比每百斤小麻多出半斤油，比豆多出油十五斤半。这种油可以吃，味道很好可以赶得上小麻油。
