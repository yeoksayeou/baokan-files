Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th - At noon on August 3rd, in Bangli Village, Nandan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, someone suddenly shouted, "A tiger is catching and eating a dog in the fields!" As soon as the voice fell, an old man strode out and chased the tiger in the fields. The tiger, seeing the man chasing it, immediately bared its fangs and claws and pounced on the old man. The old man couldn't dodge in time and was injured on the top of his head by the tiger. As he quickly jumped to the side, his palm was bitten. But the old man still bravely stepped forward and fought the tiger with his bare hands. For a moment, man and tiger wrestled together, rolling down from a hillside more than ten feet high. At this time, the old man took the opportunity to jump up, tightly grabbed the tiger's neck, and used all his strength to press the tiger into the muddy slurry in the field, shouting, "The tiger is caught!" At this moment, production team leader Hu Kairong had already arrived. He quickly drew the firewood knife slanting behind the old man and fiercely killed the tiger.
    This old man is Grandpa Bai from Xiazai Village, Bangli Village. He is sixty-one years old this year. The story of him catching a tiger with his bare hands was published in the Yishan Peasant News of Guangxi Province on the 16th.

    六一老人空手打虎
    新华社南宁18日电　八月三日中午，在桂西僮族自治州南丹县帮里村，忽然有人高喊：“老虎在田坝上捉狗吃啦！”声音刚落，有一个老汉就健步飞奔，向田坝上的老虎追去。老虎看见人追来，立刻张牙舞爪地向老汉扑过来。老汉抵挡不及，头顶被老虎伤了一处，当他急忙跳过一边时，手掌又被咬伤了。但老汉仍然奋勇向前，赤手空拳地和老虎搏斗起来。一时人虎扭作一团，从一丈多高的斜山坡滚下去。这时老汉趁机跃起，紧紧地抓住老虎颈部，用尽力气把老虎按压到田里的烂泥浆中，并且高喊：“捉住老虎了！”这时，生产队长胡开荣已经赶到，他迅速地抽出老汉背后斜插的柴刀，狠命地把老虎砍死了。
    这位老汉是帮里村下寨屯的柏大爷，他今年已经有六十一岁了。他赤手空拳捉老虎的故事，登载在十六日的广西省宜山农民报上。
