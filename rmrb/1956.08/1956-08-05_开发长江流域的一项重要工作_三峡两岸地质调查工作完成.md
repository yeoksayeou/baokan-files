Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 3rd: From May to July this year, Chinese geologists completed a seepage geological survey of the limestone area of ​​more than 11,000 square kilometers on both sides of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Now they are actively sorting out the data and drawing geological maps. A formal geological survey report will be submitted soon.

The seepage survey of the limestone area in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River is an extremely important task in the development of the Yangtze River Basin. The areas where the seepage survey was conducted were all historically geological blanks on both sides of the Three Gorges, which geologists had never visited before.

In order to find out the complicated geological structure of the Three Gorges, the geologists haunted the mountains all day long. They climbed over the peaks of the so-called "skyline" that went straight into the clouds and went deep into the virgin forest area. Once, the geological team on the south bank of the Yangtze River led by engineer Dai Guangxiu, in order to find out the distribution of impermeable strata, crossed a mountain 2,000 meters above sea level and crossed more than 20 miles of primeval shrub forest with few people, until the Qingjiang River bank, a tributary of the Yangtze River. Sometimes, in order to determine an important geological point, the geologists often did not avoid difficulties and dangers, walking on the narrow and steep "cliff road" that was faintly visible on the mountainside. When encountering steep cliffs, they slowly climbed, grabbing branches and holding onto rocks.

In June and July, although continuous heavy rains and clouds swirling around the mountains often brought great difficulties to the work, their tenacious work spirit overcame the difficulties. Whenever the clouds were thick and it was difficult to see, the geologists ran more roads than usual and observed more carefully. At the same time, as long as the raincoats and straw hats could withstand the heavy rain, they always insisted on working.

Most of the people participating in the seepage survey in the Three Gorges area this time are young and excellent geological workers in our country. They have participated in the geological work of radically treating the Yellow River, Huai River and other rivers, and some of them are students studying at the Northeast Geological Institute. Geologists told reporters that the geological structure of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River is relatively complex, which requires them to run more and think more during their work and improve their observation ability. At the beginning, it often took them more than an hour to determine a geological point, but later it only took half an hour. They also said that now, except for a small part of the area on the north and south banks of the Three Gorges, the geological blank areas left by previous geologists have been filled.

### 开发长江流域的一项重要工作  三峡两岸地质调查工作完成

    开发长江流域的一项重要工作
    三峡两岸地质调查工作完成
    新华社武汉3日电　今年五月到七月，我国地质人员在长江三峡两岸完成了面积约达一万一千多平方公里的石灰岩区渗漏地质调查工作，现在他们正在积极整理资料，绘制地质图，不久就要提出正式的地质调查报告。
    长江三峡石灰岩区渗漏调查工作，是开发长江流域的一项极为重要的工作。进行渗漏调查的地区，都是三峡两岸历史上的地质空白地区，过去地质人员从来没有到过。
    为了弄清三峡两岸复杂的地质构造情况，地质人员终日出没在万山丛中，他们曾经几次翻过直插云端的所谓“天际线”的高峰，深入到原始森林地带。有一次，工程师戴广秀领导的长江南岸地质组为了查明隔水岩层分布情况，翻过海拔两千公尺的大山，穿过二十多里路断人稀的原始灌木林，直到长江支流清江岸边。有时，为了定一个重要的地质点，地质人员往往不避艰险，行走在半山腰中时隐时现的又窄又陡的“崖路”上。遇到陡壁峭岩，他们就攀枝扶石缓慢地爬行着。
    六、七月间，尽管连续不断的暴雨和缭绕山头的云雾经常给工作带来很大困难，但是他们顽强的工作精神战胜了困难。每当云雾浓厚、眉目难分的时候，地质人员就比平时多跑些路，观测时更加细心。同时，只要雨衣、草帽能够抵得住暴雨侵袭的话，他们总是坚持工作。
    参加这次三峡地区渗漏调查工作的人们，大都是我国年轻而优秀的地质工作者。他们曾经参加过根治黄河、淮河等河流的地质工作，其中还有一些是正在东北地质学院念书的学生。地质人员告诉记者，长江三峡地质构造比较复杂，这就使他们在工作时必须多跑多想，提高观测能力。开始时，他们定一个地质点，往往要花一个多小时，后来只需半小时。他们还说，现在三峡南北两岸除小部分地区外，前辈地质人员所遗留下来的地质空白地区，已经填补起来了。
