    Reading "Ten Years of Hard Study"
    Xiao Yan
    Ideological problems can be solved from the ideological aspect. If it is not, or not entirely, an ideological problem, and we insist on solving it from the ideological aspect, or even try to solve it by "labeling," then the problem cannot be solved. Fan Rongkang's article "Ten Years of Hard Study," published on the second page of the People's Daily on July 7th, has this problem.
    Besides neglecting the difference between complex labor and simple labor, and inappropriately comparing the remuneration of a college graduate who has just started working with that of a worker who has just entered the factory, the main shortcoming of this article is: it indiscriminately regards the complaint of "Ten years of hard study, still only one hundred and fifty" as an ideological problem, and forcefully connects it with "Enduring hardship to become superior" and "All other professions are lowly, only studying is noble" for criticism. It seems that the problem is completely solved in this way. Whoever has the complaint of "Ten years of hard study, still only one hundred and fifty" again, is thinking of becoming "superior," and holds the view of "studying is noble." In this way, no one dares to voice "complaints," right? But, is the problem gone? No.
    Holding the view of "Ten years of hard study" and competing with the people for待遇(treatment/pay), is certainly wrong. However, even so, even if someone does hold the views of "superior" and "studying is noble," we should, on the one hand, help them solve ideological problems, and on the other hand, seriously consider whether this "one hundred and fifty" is reasonable. Premier Zhou Enlai said in the "Report on the Question of Intellectuals": "Another important issue concerning the living treatment of intellectuals is the upgrading system. Our current upgrading system has many unreasonable aspects: many levels with small intervals; the levels of college graduates are too low..."
    It can be seen that dissatisfaction with "still only one hundred and fifty" is not just an ideological problem, but also a reflection of shortcomings in wage work. Precisely because of this, wage reform is necessary.
    Comrade Fan Rongkang is right to worry that "promising too much" will "spoil good things." The wage levels of our country's workers are generally not high, and although wage reforms are being carried out this year, it is indeed impossible to increase them much in the short term. This is because wage increases cannot be separated from increases in labor productivity. Only on the basis of continuously developing production and improving labor productivity can we gradually improve the lives of workers. It is wrong to "promise too much" without the growth of labor productivity; but it is also wrong to turn a blind eye to unreasonable phenomena, not allow expressing hopes, and not make improvements.

    Editor's note: After the publication of the article "Ten Years of Hard Study," dozens of submissions from readers were received, expressing different views on the article's wording. We have selected Comrade Xiao Yan's article to publish here. We believe that Comrade Xiao Yan's opinion is correct. Other submissions related to the article "Ten Years of Hard Study" will not be replied to individually.

### 读“十年寒窗苦”
小言

    读“十年寒窗苦”
    小言
    思想问题可以从思想方面来解决，如果不是、或者不完全是思想问题，也硬从思想方面来解决，甚至想靠“扣帽子”来解决，那问题是解决不了的。七月七日人民日报二版上，范荣康同志写的“十年寒窗苦”一文就有这个毛病。
    这篇文章除了忽略了复杂劳动同简单劳动的区别，不恰当地把一个刚参加工作的大、专学校毕业生的报酬，同一个刚进工厂的工人所得的报酬比较之外，最主要的缺点是：不加区别地把“十年寒窗苦，还是一百五”的怨言，一概视为思想问题，并且硬同“吃尽苦中苦，方为人上人”，“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”联系起来，加以批判。好像这么一来，问题就完全解决了。谁要是再有“十年寒窗苦，还是一百五”的怨言，谁就是想做“人上人”，就是抱有“读书高”的见解。这样，谁也不敢发“怨言”了吧！可是，问题是不是就没有了呢？不。
    持“十年寒窗苦”，跟人民争待遇，当然不对。但是，即使如此，甚至即使有人确实抱有“人上人”、“读书高”的见解，我们也应该一方面帮助他们解决思想问题，另一方面认真考虑一下，这个“一百五”到底合不合理。周恩来总理在“关于知识分子问题的报告”里就说过：“有关知识分子生活待遇的另一个重要问题是升级制度。我们现在的升级制度有很多不合理的地方：等级多而等距小；高等学校毕业学生的等级太低……”
    由此可见，不满于“还是一百五”，并不只是思想问题，同时也是工资工作中的缺点的反映，正因为这样，才要进行工资改革。
    范荣康同志担心“广许心愿”，会把“好事办坏了”，这是对的。我国职工的工资水平一般都不高，今年虽然进行工资改革，但在短期内也确实不可能提高很多。这是因为工资的增长不能离开劳动生产率的增长，只有在不断地发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，才能逐步改善职工生活。离开了劳动生产率的增长，去“广许心愿”是不对的；但因此对不合理的现象熟视无睹，不许心愿，不加改进，也是不对的。
    编者按：“十年寒窗苦”一文发表后，收到几十件读者的来稿和来信，对这篇文章的提法表示不同的看法。我们选择小言同志的一篇在这里发表。我们认为小言同志的意见是正确的。其他有关“十年寒窗苦”一文的来稿和来信不再一一回复了。
