To investigate the hydroelectric resource reserves in the Northwest, the Beijing Hydroelectric Design Institute and the Lanzhou Hydroelectric Survey and Design Institute jointly dispatched three survey teams in June of this year to conduct hydroelectric resource surveys in the Tongtian River, Inland River, Garmu River, and Tata Leng River basins in southern Qinghai.

This is the first time that hydroelectric resource survey personnel have appeared on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The areas where the survey teams are going are mostly plateaus at an altitude of four to five thousand meters, sparsely populated and with inconvenient transportation. The living supplies of the survey personnel must be transported by yak and mule from supply stations far away to the work sites. Fuel must also be transported from hundreds of miles away. The organization of the team, the large supply equipment, and the arduous transportation are rare for general survey teams.

The survey teams were warmly welcomed and entertained by local governments when they passed through Xining and Yushu. Before leaving Yushu, the survey team spent three days surveying a section of the Batang River, selecting several hydroelectric sites, roughly surveying two sections of the terrain, and making a schematic diagram of the water diversion layout for a 500 kW hydroelectric power station for one of the sections. A survey report and preliminary development opinions were put forward.

This survey team arrived at the survey site in late June and began work. The air on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is thin, and the air pressure is mostly below 450 mm. Working under these conditions requires a lot of physical strength and is prone to altitude sickness; slight exertion causes weakness throughout the body and shortness of breath. At present, all members of the survey team are overcoming all difficulties and working at a rate of six to eight kilometers per day on the Tongtian River, Garmu River, Tata Leng River, and other rivers with a total length of 1,500 kilometers. All survey work will be completed by the end of this year.

### 青藏高原上出现第一支水力资源普查队

    青藏高原上出现第一支水力资源普查队
    本报讯　为调查西北水力资源蕴藏情况，今年6月，北京水电设计院、兰州水电勘测处联合派出三个普查队，去青海南部的通天河、内陆河、噶尔穆河和塔塔棱河等流域，进行水力资源普查工作。
    水力资源普查人员在青藏高原还是第一次出现。普查队所去的地方，多是海拔四千到五千公尺的高原，人烟稀少，交通不便。普查人员的生活用品，须用牦牛、骡马从很远的供应站驮运到工作地点。燃料也须从百里之外运来。队部的组织，庞大的给养装备，艰巨的运输，都是一般查勘队所罕见的。
    普查队途经西宁、玉树时，曾受当地政府的热烈欢迎和招待。普查队在离开玉树前，曾用了三天的时间，对巴塘河的一段进行了踏勘，选出几个水力地址，草测了两段地形，并对其中的一段做出一个五百瓩水电站的引水布置示意图。提出了踏勘报告和开发的初步意见。
    这支普查队于6月下旬就到达普查地点开始了工作。青藏高原空气稀薄，气压多在四百五十公厘以下。在这种条件下进行工作，需要消耗大量体力，并且容易发生高空病症；稍一劳动便感到全身无力，呼吸急促。目前，普查队全体人员正在克服一切困难，在通天河、噶尔穆河、塔塔棱河等全长一千五百公里的河流上，每天以六到八公里的进度进行工作。全部普查工作，将在今年年底完成。
