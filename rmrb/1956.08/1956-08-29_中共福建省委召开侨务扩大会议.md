Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 27th: The Fourth Enlarged Meeting on Overseas Chinese Affairs of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee was held in Fuzhou from the 20th to the 25th. The meeting discussed how to further improve overseas Chinese affairs and develop production in overseas Chinese hometowns in the future.

Over the past year, Fujian Province has, in major social reforms such as agricultural cooperation, socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and handicraft cooperation, formulated many specific measures based on the characteristics and practical conditions of overseas Chinese hometowns, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their families. Now, more than 90% of returned overseas Chinese and their families have joined cooperatives, and more than 96% of overseas Chinese landlords and rich peasants have changed their class status ahead of schedule. Specific considerations have also been given to returned overseas Chinese and their families in terms of material supply.

However, the meeting believed that due to one-sidedness in leadership work and some cadres' lack of attention to overseas Chinese affairs, some deviations and errors have occurred in the implementation of overseas Chinese policies. The meeting pointed out that doing a good job in overseas Chinese affairs is a matter for the entire Party, and demanded that cadres at all levels, especially all overseas Chinese affairs cadres, should have a good understanding of the fact that overseas Chinese and their families are an indispensable force in socialist construction. In any work in overseas Chinese areas, the issue of overseas Chinese must be taken into consideration. The meeting made corresponding decisions on strengthening overseas Chinese affairs agencies at all levels and replenishing cadres to strengthen leadership over overseas Chinese affairs.

The meeting also specifically studied how to lead returned overseas Chinese and their families to develop production, increase income, and improve their material and cultural lives. The meeting demanded that efforts be made to increase the income of 90% of returned overseas Chinese and their families. In addition to actively developing production and rationally distributing labor income in the same way as the broad masses of peasants, the methods for increasing income should also take into account the specific characteristics of returned overseas Chinese and their families and give play to their strengths. For example, they can be organized to participate in various sideline productions according to the principle of voluntariness, and overseas Chinese family members who are not accustomed to field labor can be assigned to raise poultry, livestock, bees, silkworms, etc., or they can be organized to establish handicraft production such as car spinning, knitting, weaving, and embroidery, or participate in rural cultural education, health, and other work. In addition, the meeting also put forward specific requirements for guiding overseas Chinese investment, resettling returned overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students returning to the country.

More than 170 people attended the meeting, including deputy secretaries of the CPC local committees, county committees, city committees, and district committees in overseas Chinese areas, county heads and district heads, as well as overseas Chinese affairs cadres and responsible persons of relevant provincial leading agencies.

    中共福建省委召开侨务扩大会议
    新华社福州27日电　中共福建省委员会第四次侨务扩大会议20日到25日在福州市召开。会议讨论了今后如何进一步做好侨务工作、发展侨乡生产等问题。
    一年来，福建省在农业合作化、资本主义工商业改造和手工业合作化等重大社会改革中，都根据侨乡特点和实际情况，规定了许多具体措施，发挥了广大归侨和侨眷的积极性。现在有90％以上归侨和侨眷参加了合作社，96％以上的华侨地主、富农提前改变了成份。对归侨和侨眷在物资供应等方面也有具体照顾。
    但是，会议认为由于领导工作中的片面性和一些干部不重视侨务工作，以致在贯彻侨务政策中出现了一些偏差和错误。会议指出，做好侨务工作是全党的事情，要求各级干部特别是全体侨务干部，要很好地认识华侨和侨眷是社会主义建设中一支不可忽视的力量。在侨区任何工作都要考虑到华侨问题。会议对加强各级侨务机构并充实干部，以加强对侨务工作的领导等问题，做出了相应的决定。
    会议还具体研究了如何领导归侨侨眷发展生产，增加收入，改善他们的物质和文化生活等问题。会议要求力争90％的归侨和侨眷增加收入。增加收入的办法，除和广大农民一样积极发展生产和合理分配劳动收益以外，还要根据归侨和侨眷的具体特点，发挥他们的特长。如按自愿原则组织他们参加各种副业生产，对没有田间劳动习惯的侨眷可以分配以饲养家禽，家畜、养蜂、养蚕等，或组织成立车纺、针织、编织、刺绣等手工业生产，或参加乡村文化教育、卫生等工作。此外，会议还提出了对辅导华侨投资、安置归侨和归国华侨学生等工作的具体要求。
    参加这次会议的有侨区中共各地委、县委、市委、区委副书记，县长和区长，以及侨务干部和省的有关领导机关负责人等共一百七十多人。
