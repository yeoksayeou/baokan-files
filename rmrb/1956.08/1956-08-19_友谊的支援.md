    Friendship's Support
    This newspaper reports: Farmers in Wantan, Yongchang, Nvbu, Lanxi and other districts of Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, have demonstrated a spirit of unity and mutual assistance by donating the rice seedlings they could spare to farmers in areas affected by typhoon disasters, helping the disaster-stricken farmers replant late rice in a timely manner.
    As of August 10th, the county had sent out more than 420,000 bundles of double-season late rice seedlings, enough for farmers in disaster areas to plant more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields. The Shanghua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiayu Township uprooted more than 80,000 bundles of seedlings to support the disaster areas. After uprooting the seedlings overnight, the Shetang Agricultural Cooperative in Yongchang Township immediately had its cadres lead more than 60 cooperative members to transport the seedlings to the railway station.
    In order to quickly deliver the seedlings to the train for transport, more than 60 male and female members of the Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshan Township and more than 200 PLA soldiers and police officers have been actively bundling seedlings and loading them onto trains in recent days, striving to transport them as soon as possible so that farmers in disaster areas can promptly rush to plant and replant.

    友谊的支援
    本报讯　浙江省兰溪县万坛、永昌、女埠、兰西等区农民发挥了团结互助精神，把自己可以抽出的秧苗赠送给遭受台风灾害地区的农民，帮助受灾农民及时补种晚稻。
    到八月十日止，全县已经送出四十二万多把双季晚稻秧苗，可供灾区农民下种四千多亩水稻田。下余乡上华农业生产合作社把八万多把秧苗拔起来支援灾区。永昌乡社塘农业社连夜拔好秧苗后，当即由社干部率领六十多个社员把秧苗运送到火车站。
    为了把秧苗迅速交火车运出，岩山乡联盟农业社六十多个男女社员和二百多名解放军、公安队员，连日积极扎捆秧苗装车，争取及早运出，让灾区农民及时抢种、补种。
