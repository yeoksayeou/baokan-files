A Mixture of Joy and Fear
    – Some Thoughts After Participating in Scientific Planning
    Fu Ying
    Since returning to China in 1950, I have personally witnessed the daily improvement of the lives of the broad masses of people, the rapid development of national construction, and the gradual elimination of many bad systems left over by history. In just a few years, China has become a vibrant and confident country. For a scientist who has experienced many hardships, this new environment is like seeing a clear sky after a long rain and the clearing of clouds and fog. Naturally, one is extremely excited. However, after the excitement, I still feel frustrated at times. As a university teacher, my most important task is to cultivate young people. Like other teachers, I am willing to pass on all my skills, especially my research experience, to the next generation. However, in the first four or five years after returning to China, most of my energy was consumed by general teaching and administrative issues. I had no time to attend to the most important aspect of cultivating young people – scientific research. After I returned to Peking University in 1954, the university authorities supported research work, but the frustration was not completely eliminated because the direction of my efforts was not clear.
    In the great and complex undertaking of building a new China, there are many aspects that need research, but our scientific strength is extremely weak. To maximize the role of scientists, research topics must be properly arranged with priorities. To achieve this goal, we must know the specific requirements of our country's development. Otherwise, we may put the problems that need to be solved in the second Five-Year Plan behind and put the topics of the fifth Five-Year Plan in front. In this way, we will make the mistake of "distant water cannot quench a fire nearby" and misdirect our efforts. At the beginning of this year, the Party and the government once again satisfied the hopes of scientists. The State Council established the Scientific Planning Commission. The direction of scientists' efforts became clear, and my frustration was eliminated.
    In February, I received a notice to participate in scientific planning work. At that time, my mood was truly a mixture of joy and fear. I was joyful that the day we had been waiting for had arrived, and that I had the opportunity to contribute my humble opinion; I was fearful that the task was arduous and that we, who had no planning experience, even with the leadership of the Central Committee and the help of Soviet experts, could actually be competent. After receiving the draft of the most important task list, my excitement and fear increased simultaneously. Judging from this draft, the scale of this planning is truly unprecedented. From climate, ocean, agriculture, forestry, mineral resources, as well as medicine, health, engineering, and machinery, not only are everything we can think of included in the list, but also many things we cannot think of or dare not think of are also included. After this plan is completed, the change in the face of the country will far exceed our ideals. Twelve years is a very short time. Within this short period of time, the prosperous and strong motherland that we have dreamed of for decades will become a reality, and I will actually have the day to witness this miracle. How can I not be excited? Because the scale is so large and our strength is so weak, the plan we make cannot be without many shortcomings. If the plan is not made well, the loss to the country will not only be huge but also long-term. Thinking of this, I feel even more responsible and must work diligently to do things well.
    After four months of effort, we completed the historic task of formulating a science and technology plan. Now I would like to talk about some thoughts. These thoughts still come from a mixture of joy and fear. First of all, I believe that only in China under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such a comprehensive and long-term plan on this scale. Not only can no precedents be found in the history of China and capitalist countries, but even the Soviet academicians specially invited to China admire our courage. I am not only proud to be able to participate in this great work, but also fortunate to believe that we can definitely complete this plan based on the achievements of construction that I have personally seen. Second, I believe that through this planning, Chinese science can take root. China has been promoting science for nearly a hundred years, but science has not taken root in China. The main reason is that theory is divorced from practice. In old China, people engaged in science stayed in ivory towers all day long, not daring or willing to come into contact with reality. This kind of science is like a potted pine tree, which is also verdant and lovely, but not enough to be a pillar. When implementing this plan, scientists have stepped out of the ivory tower. Endless new problems require the development and growth of science. After twelve years, our scientific saplings will not be bonsai but pillars. Third, what impressed me deeply was the comprehensiveness of the plan. Not only can disciplines directly related to production develop rapidly, but some disciplines that are not directly related are also taken care of in the same way. In the initial stage, some scientists engaged in pure theory were a little lost after reading the list of most important tasks because their expertise was not closely related to those tasks. Although some disciplines do not have a direct relationship with production now, from the point of view of the development of a science, they are indispensable. For example, although number theory, quantum electrodynamics, and chemical bond theory cannot guide production now, no one can deny the importance of these three departments for the development of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, three basic sciences. After a long period of discussion, a basic theory item was added to the task list. This ensures the healthy development of all sciences and stabilizes the emotions of many scientists. Fourth, I received a lot of education when participating in the planning. For example, I wrote several explanations of central issues. When the draft was completed, I thought it was not bad, but when I took it to the group for discussion, everyone raised opinions, and I realized that it was completely different from what I thought. In addition, the discussion of many issues also gave me great inspiration. What I cannot forget most is Mr. Li Fangxun of Nanjing University's view on technological processes. He said that our engineers often rigidly apply foreign production methods to China, not knowing that any method is developed based on the properties of raw materials. Our resources are often different from those of foreign countries, so a method that is very successful in foreign countries may not get good results in China. An important task for our scientists and engineers is to develop production methods suitable for our country's raw materials. For example, if our country lacks a certain kind of alumina, we should not rigidly apply Hall's electrolysis method. Although this view is plain and unremarkable, it is a blow to the head for our scientists and engineers, especially those who have received higher education abroad. We often forget that methods are inseparable from raw materials, and we regard foreign methods as golden rules without distinguishing between right and wrong. The poor quality of products in many production units in recent years is the result of forgetting this simple truth. Finally, participating in the planning made me love my profession even more. I am engaged in colloid chemistry. Colloid chemistry is the most widely used and most neglected department in chemistry in China. Before liberation, very few universities offered this course. Even today, only two universities have this major, while all comprehensive universities and many colleges related to the chemical industry in the Soviet Union have this major. When browsing the central issues of various tasks, I found that 26 tasks were directly related to colloid chemistry. The scope is wider than any science can compare. Although the task of training talents has become heavier, I believe that colloid chemists at Nanjing University and Peking University will be very happy to accept this glorious task.
    The above are all aspects that excite me. Are there any aspects that make me fear besides worrying about not being able to do the planning well? The answer is definitely yes. The first is the lack of manpower. There are very few people who can lead research at present. This is a well-known situation, so there is no need to say more. The number of college graduates who can do at least basic research is also far from enough. What I fear most is not the lack of manpower, but the production of a large number of graduates who do not meet the requirements of research work because of the eagerness to fill vacancies and shorten the time limit. From the point of view of doing research, there is not only good and second-best, but also the difference between being able and not being able. Ten people who cannot do research work cannot replace one person who can do research work. If we are too hasty, we may ruin young people with potential for cultivation. The second is that departmentalism has not been eliminated. Some units open their mouths and ask for dozens of research institutes, each requiring thousands of college graduates. If there is a real need, that's fine, but the fact is not necessarily the case, because if you ask whether there are so many research topics to assign to these college students, the answer is often silence. Without considering the source of these college students, just in terms of mentors, these thousands of senior researchers are a big problem. Without senior researchers to lead, hoarding so many college students will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of idling, while some institutions with senior researchers do not have assistants. The third is some people's incorrect views on research and researchers. I heard that some people have made remarks about abolishing the Academy of Sciences. I also heard someone say: Now scientists want anything, and we give them anything. When they can't produce results in a few years, we will settle the accounts with them. Although these remarks are only the opinions of a very small number of people, and may not be the opinions of responsible persons, the existence of this kind of view is an obstacle to the development of science. Some of the above have been corrected when considering measures, and some will not happen at all under the correct leadership of the Party. However, this kind of phenomenon should still be paid attention to and overcome in the future.
    In the future, when implementing the scientific plan, universities will undoubtedly bear a great responsibility. I would like to express some opinions on scientific research in universities from the perspective of a plan implementer. At present, all universities have attached importance to research and have taken some measures to save some time for research. These are all gratifying phenomena. However, some problems have not been completely resolved. Here I only put forward some views on time and equipment for reference. As for the more important issue of cultivating young cadres, it is too long to talk about, so I will not mention it here. The first point to consider is the oral examination system. The current classes are all very large. Classes with more than 200 people are very common. Some people also teach more than one class (I am one of them). Calculating half an hour for one person in the oral examination, 200 people is 100 hours. During the oral examination, teachers must concentrate on listening to the students' answers. In this tense situation, working six hours a day is not too little, and 100 hours is 17 days. Because of the scheduling of examination schedules and other reasons, these 17 days cannot be arranged continuously, so the examination period for a large class will be dragged on for more than 20 days. Two examinations a year will be nearly two months. It is impossible to do research during these two months. This is equivalent to saying that at least one-sixth of the time in a year cannot be used for research. If the oral examination has great advantages, then it is still worthwhile, but from several years of experience, I have not found any advantages other than not having to look at the examination papers. On the contrary, I have seen many students sweating like pulp in the cold winter and teachers who are dizzy after returning home. The number of teachers and students with neurasthenia in schools has been alarming in recent years. "Collective life" is certainly one reason, but oral examinations may also be largely responsible. The second point to consider is the workload system. One of the purposes of implementing this system is to ensure teachers' research time. From the surface hours, it seems that the system is formulated very reasonably, but the fact is not so. The most unreasonable aspect of this system is that it does not count the time for preparing lessons. This is a fatal injury for young lecturers and teaching assistants. I have 33 years of teaching experience. Now, if I want to lecture in a way that satisfies myself, I need to spend four or five hours preparing for each lecture. Lecturers and teaching assistants are far less proficient than me. Their preparation time must be at least twice as long as mine. If the time for preparing lessons is removed, I don't know how many hours they have left for research and further study. The workload system is undoubtedly good, but it needs to be revised. The third point to consider is the supply of instruments. Purchasing instruments must have a catalog with detailed specifications. The import and export companies have been of little help to us in this regard. After finding the catalog by all means, we order goods from abroad. When the goods arrive, the customs must inspect them, and the inspectors are often very irresponsible. An important part of the X-ray camera purchased by Peking University from the Netherlands was broken, and a steel rod with a diameter of four centimeters in the viscometer purchased from Switzerland was bent. Similar things are not uncommon in other universities. Based on more than 20 years of experience in buying instruments from abroad, I can assert that this loss cannot be attributed to foreign manufacturers. The fourth point to consider is the supply of books. The International Bookstore has made achievements in its work. What I want to mention here is the slowness of importing books and periodicals. The British Chemical Society Journal, the American Chemical Society Journal, and Chemical Abstracts that Peking University ordered this year have not yet been placed on the shelves. These three kinds of publications are all what we need to refer to at all times, because there are many things in them that we urgently need to know. Seeing them one day earlier will save us one day of effort. The above situation is very unfavorable for carrying out scientific research. Their existence may be because the relevant parties and schools do not have enough contact. I hope that this situation can be improved in the near future; I also believe that this situation will definitely be improved.
    Now scientists across the country all hope that the scientific plan can be announced as soon as possible so that they can carry out their research in accordance with the requirements of the country. Scientists in universities, in addition to trying their best to train graduates who meet the requirements of research work, are also willing to work with scientists from the Academy of Sciences and industrial departments to complete this plan. As for how many departments will be able to reach the international level in twelve years, I don't think anyone can predict, but two things are certain: by then, science will definitely have taken root in China; our research results will definitely be valued internationally.
    Editor's note: It is understood that the customs inspection work has been improved. One of the purposes of our customs inspection of imported goods was originally to prevent damage and shortage of goods and protect the safety of goods. Therefore, under normal circumstances, customs inspection work will not and should not lead to damage to goods. In addition, the International Bookstore is also actively improving the import of foreign books and periodicals.

    一则以喜，一则以惧
    ——参加科学规划工作后的一些感想
    傅鹰
    我自1950年归国以来，亲眼看见了广大人民的生活日益改善，国家建设迅速发展，历史遗留下来的许多坏制度逐步消灭。在短短几年之中，中国变成了朝气蓬勃，充满自信心的国家。一个饱经忧患的科学工作者，在这个新环境中，真像久雨之后，忽然拨云雾而见青天，当然万分兴奋。但是兴奋之余，我有时仍感到苦闷。作为一个高等学校的教师，我的最重要任务是培养青年。同其他教师一样，我愿意将全身武艺，特别是研究经验，传授给下一代。但是在我回国的最初四、五年中，我的大部分精力全消磨在一般的教学和事务性问题上，对于培养青年的最主要环节——科学研究反而无暇过问。在1954年我回到北京大学以后，学校当局对于研究工作予以支持，但是苦闷仍未完全消除，因为努力的方向不明确。
    在建设新中国这一伟大而复杂的事业中，需要研究的方面很多，而我们的科学力量却异常薄弱。要想使科学家发挥最大的作用，就必须把研究题目妥当地安排个先后缓急。要想达到这个目的，就必须知道我们国家发展中的具体要求，否则就很可能把第二个五年计划中需要解决的问题排在后面，把第五个五年计划的题目反而排在前面。这样一来，就会犯了远水不救近火，用力不当的毛病。今年年初党和政府又一次满足了科学家的希望，国务院成立了科学规划委员会，科学家努力的方向明确了，我的苦闷消除了。
    二月里，我接到通知，要我去参加科学规划工作。我那时的心情真是一则以喜，一则以惧。喜的是我们朝夕盼望的日子来到了，而且我有机会贡献出一得之愚；惧的是任务艰巨，我们这些没有规划经验的人，虽然有中央的领导和苏联专家的帮助，究竟能否胜任？接到了最重要任务表的草案以后，我的兴奋和恐惧的程度又同时增加了。从这个草案看来，这次规划的规模之大真是史无前例。自气候、海洋、农林、矿产以及医药、卫生、工程、机械，不但我们想得到的都在表中，还有许多我们想不到或不敢想的也包括在内。这个规划圆满完成以后，国家面貌的改变将远远超过我们的理想。十二年的光阴是很短的。在这短短时间以内，几十年来梦想的富强的祖国就成为事实了，而我居然有亲眼看见这个奇迹的日子，怎么不兴奋呢？因为规模如此之大，我们的力量又如此薄弱，作出的规划不可能没有许多欠妥之处，而规划若是作的不好，对国家的损失不但是巨大的，而且是长期的。想到这里更感到自己的责任重大，要兢兢业业，才能把事办好。
    经过了四个月的努力，我们完成了制定科学技术规划的历史任务。现在我想略谈一些感想。这些感想还是发自一则以喜，一则以惧的心情。首先，我相信只有在共产党领导下的中国才可能有这种规模的全面长远规划。不但在中国和资本主义国家的历史中找不到先例，就是特聘来中国的苏联院士们也钦佩我们的勇气。我不但因为能够参加这个伟大的工作而自豪，而且还因为根据亲身看到的建设成就，相信我们一定可以完成这个规划而自幸。第二，我相信经过这次规划，中国的科学可以生根。中国提倡科学已将近百年，而科学在中国并未生根。主要的原因是理论脱离了实际。在旧中国搞科学的人整天关在象牙塔中，不敢也不愿意接触现实。这种科学就像盆景的小松树一般，虽也苍翠可爱，但是够不上栋梁之材。在执行这个规划时，科学家走出了象牙塔，无穷无尽的新问题，要求科学的发展和成长，十二年之后我们的科学小松树就不是盆景而成为栋梁了。第三，给我很深印象的是规划的全面性。不但同生产直接有关的学科可以迅速的发展，有些无直接关系的学科也同样的得到照顾。在最初阶段，有些搞纯理论的科学家看了最重要任务表后有点惘然，因为他们的专长同那些任务没有多大的关系。有些学科虽然现在同生产尚无直接的关系，但是从一门科学发展的观点来看，它们却是不可少的。例如数论、量子电动力学、化学键理论虽然现在还不能指导生产，但是对于数学、物理、化学三门基本科学的发展，谁也不能不承认这三个部门的重要性。经过了长时间的讨论，在任务表中添了基本理论一项。这样一来就保证了各门科学的健康发展，也安定了许多科学家的情绪。第四，在参加规划的时候，我受了很多教育。例如我写了几个中心问题的说明书，才脱稿的时候，我觉得还不坏，但是拿到小组中一讨论，大家一提意见，才知道完全不像自己所想的那样。此外，许多问题的讨论也给我很大的启发。最使我不能忘记的是南京大学的李方训先生对于工艺过程的见解。他说，我们的工程师常常将外国的某种生产方法硬搬到中国来用，不知任何方法全是根据原料的性质发展出来的。我们的资源常常和外国的不同，因此一种在外国很成功的方法在中国就很可能得不到好结果。我们科学家和工程师的一个重要任务，就是发展适合于我国原料的生产方法。例如我国缺少某种氧化铝，就不应当硬搬霍尔的电解法。这种见解虽然平淡无奇，但是对于我国的科学家和工程师，特别是在国外受过高等教育的，却是当头一棒。我们常常忘记了方法是同原料分不开的，而不分青红皂白把外国的方法当作金科玉律。近几年许多生产单位的出品质量不佳，就是忘了这个浅近真理的结果。最后，参加规划使我更热爱我的专业。我是搞胶体化学的。胶体化学是化学中应用最广而在中国最被忽视的一个部门。在解放前很少大学开过这门课。就是在今天也只有两个大学有这个专业，而在苏联所有的综合大学和许多同化学工业有关的高等学校都有这个专业。在浏览各项任务的中心问题的时候，我发现有二十六项任务同胶体化学有直接的关系。其范围之广远非任何科学所能比拟。虽然培养人材的任务加重了，我相信南京大学和北京大学的胶体化学家一定会很高兴地接受这个光荣的任务。
    以上所说的全是使我兴奋的方面。是不是除了担心不能将规划作好之外还有使我恐惧的方面呢？肯定地说是有的。首先是人力的缺乏。现时能够领导研究的人极少。这是人所共知的情况，不必说了，就是可以作起码研究的大学毕业生的数量也还差的很多。我所最怕的还不是人力不足，而是因为急于补缺，缩短年限而制造出大批不合乎作研究工作要求的毕业生。从作研究的观点来看，不但有好与次好，还有能与不能之别。十个不能作研究工作的人并不能代替一个能作研究工作的。若是操之过急，就很可能把有培养前途的青年毁了。第二是本位主义未曾消除。有的单位一开口就是几十个研究所，每所要上千的大学毕业生。倘若真有需要，倒也罢了，但事实却未必如此，因为若是请教一声有无那样多的研究题目分配给这些大学生，所得的答案常是哑然。姑且不考虑这些大学生的来源，只就导师而论，这上千个高级研究人员就是大问题。没有高级研究人员领导，囤积了这许多大学生，势必造成窝工现象，而有些有高级研究人员的机构中反而没有助手了。第三是某些人对于研究及研究人员的不正确的看法。我听说曾有人发过取消科学院的言论。又听见有人说过：现在科学家们要什么就给他们什么，等到过几年拿不出成绩时再跟他们算账。这些言论虽然只是极少数人的意见，而且未必是负责人的意见，但是此种见解之存在对于科学的发展就是一种障碍。以上所说的，有的在考虑措施的时候已经纠正，有的是在党的正确领导下根本不会发生。但是这类现象在将来还是应该注意防止和克服的。
    将来执行科学规划时，高等学校无疑的要负很大的责任。我想以一个规划执行者的资格对高等学校的科学研究发表一些意见。现时各校对研究都重视起来了，也采取了一些措施，节省出一部分时间来作研究。这全是可喜的现象。但是还有些问题未能圆满解决。在这里我只对于时间和设备提出一些看法以供参考，至于更重要的培养青年干部的问题说来太长，这里不提了。第一点应当考虑的是口试制度。现时的班全是很大的。二百多人的班是很普遍的。有些人还担任了不止一班的课（我就是一个）。以一人口试半小时计算，二百人就是一百小时。口试的时候，教师必须全神贯注地听学生的回答。在这种紧张的情形下，每天工作六小时就不少了，一百小时就是十七天。因为排考试日程和其他原因，这十七天不能连续着排，因此一个大班的考试时期要拖到二十多天。一年考两次就将近两个月。在这两个月中要想作研究是不可能的。这就等于说，一年至少有六分之一的时间不能作研究。倘若口试有很大的优越性，那还值得，但是从几年的经验来看，除了不必看考卷之外，我还未发现有何优点。相反的我倒看见了不少在严冬季节汗出如浆的学生和归家之后神魂颠倒的教师。近年来学校中神经衰弱的师生数目惊人。“集体生活”固然是一个原因，口试恐怕也要负很大的责任。第二点应当考虑的是工作量制度。实行这个制度的一个目的是保证教师的研究时间。从表面时数看来，似乎制定得很合理，但事实并不如此。这个制度的最不合理的地方是不算备课的时间。对于年青的讲师、助教，这是致命伤。我已经有三十三年教龄。现在我若想讲的使我自己满意，每讲一堂就需要用四、五小时来准备。讲师、助教们的业务水平远不如我。他们备课的时间至少要比我多一倍。如将备课的时间除去，我不知道他们还剩几小时去作研究和进修。工作量的制度无疑是好的，但有修改的必要。第三点应当考虑的是仪器的供应。购买仪器必须有带详细规格的目录。在这一点进出口公司给我们的帮助真是很少。千方百计找到了目录，向国外订货，货到的时候海关要检查，而检查的人常常是很不负责的。北京大学自荷兰买来的爱克斯光照像机坏了重要的零件，自瑞士买来的粘度计中四厘米直径的钢杆被压弯。类似的事情在其他大学中也是数见不鲜。根据二十多年自外国买仪器的经验，我可以断言这种损失不能算在外国厂家的账上。第四点应当考虑的是图书的供应。国际书店的工作是有成绩的。这里要提的是进口书刊迟缓的问题。北京大学所订今年的英国化学会志，美国化学会志，化学文摘至今还未列在架上。这三种刊物全是我们时刻需要参考的，因为其中有许多我们急需知道的东西，早一天看到就多省我们一天的工夫。以上的情况对于展开科学研究是很不利的。它们之所以存在，可能是因为有关方面和学校的接触不够。我希望在不久的将来这种情况可以改善；我也相信这种情况一定能改善。
    现在全国的科学家全希望科学规划能够早日公布，好配合国家的要求来进行自己的研究，高等学校中的科学家们除了尽量地培养合乎作研究工作的毕业生之外，还愿意和科学院及产业部门的科学家共同努力来完成这个规划。至于十二年后究竟有多少部门能够达到国际水平，我想谁也不能预言，但是有两点是肯定的：到那时科学在中国一定生了根；我们的研究成绩一定能得到国际间的重视。
    编者按：据了解，海关的检查工作已经有了改进。我国海关检查进口货的目的之一原是防止货物损坏短少、保护货物安全。因此在一般情况下，海关的检查工作是不会也不应该招致货物损坏的。另外，国际书店也正在积极改进外国书刊的进口工作。
