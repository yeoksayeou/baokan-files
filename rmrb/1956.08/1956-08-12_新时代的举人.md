It is said there is such a story: In the late Qing Dynasty, there was an examination for the degree of "juren" (recommended man), and the essay question was "On Xiang Yu and Napoleon." One candidate was stumped, because he did not know what "Napoleon" was. But the "juren" was, after all, skilled at writing, and he wrote the following ingenious piece: "Xiang Yu had the strength to uproot mountains, how could he not be able to seize a mere broken wheel?..." But at that time, it was very common for "xiucai" (government licentiates) and "juren" to only know how to write eight-legged essays and not know general knowledge.

Recently, when the Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy recruited new students, the Chinese language question was "Your Views on 'Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend'." Most of the comrades from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Water Conservancy who applied did not answer this question. The reason, it is said, was similar to that of the "juren" above, they did not know what "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" was all about. One comrade wrote: "I have heard of 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom,' but I do not know about 'Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend'." Some wrote off-topic, rambling on. Some even threatened to protest to the admissions committee, saying that this question was too "unpopular."

Presumably, this comrade did not actually protest to the admissions committee, it is best not to protest. "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is already quite "popular." Don't you see these four words everywhere in various newspapers and magazines recently? These comrades who failed the exam are all cadres of state organs, even if they do not read the newspaper every day, they should have heard something about it, who knew that you are so narrow and closed-off in your lives, so "unpopular"?

    新时代的举人
    蓟草
    据说有这样一个故事：清朝末年有一次考试举人，出的作文题是“项羽拿破仑论”。有一个举人难住了，因为他不知道“拿破仑”是什么。但举人毕竟是会写文章的，他写了如下妙文“项羽力能拔山，岂一破轮而不能拿乎？……。”但当时秀才、举人只懂得做八股文、不知道一般常识的情况是很普遍的。
    最近武汉水利学院招考新生，语文题目是“你对于‘百家争鸣’的看法”。去投考的水利部长江水利委员会的同志，绝大部分都没有按照这个题目做。原因据说和那位举人相仿，不知道“百家争鸣”是怎么回事。有位同志写道：“‘百花齐放’我听说过‘百家争鸣’我不知道。”有的文不对题，乱写了一通。还有人扬言给招生委员会提抗议，说这个题出得太不“大众化”。
    大约后来这位同志并没有真的给招生委员会提抗议，真是不提为妙。“百家争鸣”实在已经“大众化”得很了。你不见近来各种报纸杂志上触目皆是这四个字吗？这些考不出的同志都是国家机关干部，即便不天天看报，也该听到一些吧，谁知你们在生活里竟是狭隘、闭塞到如此不“大众化”呢？
