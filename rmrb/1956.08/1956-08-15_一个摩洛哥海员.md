    A Moroccan Sailor
    Sun Bin
    The sailor I met last year,
    I met him again today in the port,
    Dark reddish skin,
    Eyes sparkling.
    At that time, we were at the Seamen's Club,
    The screen showed films of the Youth Festival,
    He sat next to me, constantly sighing:
    "When will such good days come to us!"
    This time I met him again in the port,
    We shook hands tightly, we embraced,
    He shouted "Long live China!"
    His whole body radiated flames of joy.
    The club was brightly lit and filled with voices,
    He danced one dance after another,
    His singing was also particularly loud,
    He didn't want to return to the ship until late at night.
    His nationality is Moroccan, from Africa,
    His home is in the countryside of Casablanca,
    His country has declared independence today,
    This is the source of his pride and happiness.

    一个摩洛哥海员
    孙滨
    去年认识的那个海员，
    今天又在港口里遇见，
    黑里透红的皮肤，
    两只眼睛光闪闪。
    那时我们在海员俱乐部，
    银幕上放映着青年联欢节的影片，
    他就坐在我的旁边，不断地叹气：
    “这样美好的日子，什么时候才临到我们！”
    这回又在港口里遇见，
    我们紧紧地握手，我们拥抱，
    他高声地欢呼着中国万岁！
    他混身都喷射着喜悦的火焰。
    俱乐部灯火辉煌，人声鼎沸，
    他一场接着一场地跳舞，
    他的歌声也特别宏亮，
    一直到深夜还不想回船。
    他的国籍是非洲摩洛哥，
    家住在卡萨布兰卡的乡间，
    他的祖国今天宣布独立了，
    这就是他骄傲和快乐的根源。
