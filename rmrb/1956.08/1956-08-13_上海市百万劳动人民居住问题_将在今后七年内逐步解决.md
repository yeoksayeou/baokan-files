    Shanghai's long-standing housing shortage will be gradually resolved in the coming years. Currently, relevant departments are drafting a plan to solve the housing problem for one million laborers in Shanghai within seven years.
    From the start of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937 until the liberation of Shanghai, many houses in Shanghai were destroyed in the war, and not many new ones were built. The population, however, increased from 3.77 million in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War to more than 5 million at the time of liberation, causing a very serious housing shortage.
    In the seven years since liberation, under the principle of municipal construction serving production, the People's Government has built 1.61 million square meters of workers' housing, and the masses have built 1.46 million square meters of simple housing themselves. However, due to the development of production, the expansion of factories, the increase of enterprises, and the continuous expansion of the ranks of workers, Shanghai's population has increased by more than one million in the past seven years, so housing still cannot meet the needs. At present, more than one million laborers live in attics, lean-tos, small rooms, and shantytowns, with very poor conditions. In order to solve this problem, relevant departments are considering solving the housing shortage within seven years, that is, by 1962, through new construction, repair, reconstruction, and adjustments. Most of the funds for new housing construction will be invested by the state, a small part will be invested by enterprises, and the method of "self-construction with public assistance" by employees will be adopted.

    上海市百万劳动人民居住问题
    将在今后七年内逐步解决
    本报讯　上海长期存在的房荒问题，将在今后几年内逐步得到解决。目前，有关部门正在草拟七年内解决上海市一百万劳动人民居住问题的方案。
    上海的房屋，从1937年抗日战争时起直到上海解放时止，在战争中毁坏了不少，新建的不多；而人口在抗日战争初期只有三百七十七万，解放时增加到五百多万，因而房荒问题闹得十分严重。
    解放七年来，人民政府在市政建设为生产服务的方针下，新建了161万平方公尺的工人住宅，群众自建了146万平方公尺的简单房屋。但是，由于生产的发展，工厂的扩建，企业的增多，工人的队伍不断扩大，七年来，上海市人口又增加了一百多万，所以住房仍不能满足需要。目前有一百多万劳动人民住在搁楼、灶披间、亭子间以及棚户区，条件很差。为了解决这个问题，有关部门正在考虑在七年内即到1962年为止，通过新建、修理、改建和调整的办法来解决房荒问题。新建房屋的资金，大部分将由国家投资，小部分由企业投资和采用职工“自建公助”的办法。
