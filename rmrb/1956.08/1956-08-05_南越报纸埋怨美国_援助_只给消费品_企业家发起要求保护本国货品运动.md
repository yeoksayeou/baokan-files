Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st - Saigon Dispatch: As the economic situation in South Vietnam has deteriorated recently, South Vietnamese public opinion has increasingly voiced dissatisfaction that the economic "aid" the United States gives to South Vietnam is mainly consumer goods.

　　Saigon's "Worker's Daily" complained in a July 30th commentary that the main part of US "aid" is for projects such as buying buffaloes, pigs, fertilizer, insecticides, and food. It emphasized that South Vietnam "also needs machines in order to develop industry and consolidate the economy after the serious destruction of ten years of war."

　　The "Vietnam Times" also pointed out not long ago that the United States is unwilling to lay the foundation for South Vietnam's economic development and is not interested in helping South Vietnam repair railways and build dams.

　　According to Saigon newspapers, U.S. economic "aid" to South Vietnam rigidly stipulates that 82% of the commodities imported from the United States must include consumer goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 3rd - Vietnam News Agency reported based on South Vietnamese newspapers that South Vietnamese entrepreneurs are launching a movement to protect local goods.

　　Some large and small South Vietnamese entrepreneurs said at a meeting held in Saigon in July that many sectors of South Vietnamese industry, such as the rubber industry, the textile industry, the foundry industry, the copper industry, and the furniture industry, are facing various difficulties and are on the verge of bankruptcy due to the flooding of foreign goods and the lack of raw materials and markets.

    南越报纸埋怨美国“援助”只给消费品
    企业家发起要求保护本国货品运动
    据新华社河内31日电　西贡消息：随着最近南越经济情况的恶化，南越舆论日益公开地表示不满美国给南越的经济“援助”主要的是消费品。
    西贡“工人报”在七月三十日的评论中抱怨美国“援助”的主要部分都是供购买水牛、猪、肥料、杀虫药和食物等这样一些项目使用的。它强调指出，南越“为了要在十年战争的严重破坏之后发展工业和巩固经济，也需要机器”。
    “越南时报”在不久以前也曾经指责美国不愿给南越的经济发展打下基础，而对帮助南越修复铁路建筑水坝等都不感到兴趣。
    据西贡报纸报道，美国给南越的经济“援助”中硬性规定了从美国输入的商品中必须包括有82％的消费品。
    据新华社河内3日电　越南通讯社据南越报纸报道，南越企业家们正在发起要求保护本地货品的运动。
    南越一些大小企业家七月间在西贡举行的一次会议上说，南越工业的许多部门，如橡胶业、纺织业、铸造业、铜器业和家具业，由于外国货的充斥以及缺乏原料和市场，都面临种种困难，并且有破产之势。
