    Old News and New Events Talk About Zhanjiang
    By our special correspondent Huang Guliu
    Where is Zhanjiang?
    Not many people living north of the Five Ridges are familiar with this place.
    A long time ago, a Song Dynasty emperor exiled a poet he disliked to this remote area. The poet sailed from Yamen at the mouth of the Pearl River in Guangdong, to the waist of the Leizhou Peninsula in the northeast, disembarked at a port in Zhanchuan County, and went to Leizhou Prefecture, then crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to Hainan Island. On his way from the Leizhou Peninsula to Hainan Island, the poet savored the fruits abundant in the subtropical region, while writing poems and inscriptions, praising the richness of the local products. People still remember these two lines he wrote:
    "I'd eat three hundred lychees every day,
    And wouldn't mind being a Lingnan man always."
    This poet's name was Su Dongpo. The place where he disembarked on the Leizhou Peninsula is now Zhanjiang Port. Obviously, in the poet's mind, these places were charming and unforgettable.
    From that time onwards, several hundred years passed. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, in 1661 AD, a French merchant ship called "Amphitrite" was blown aground in this port by a typhoon. On board were French merchants, pirates, a group of colonialists with no small ambitions. They landed at Zhanjiang Port and stayed for more than six months. What were they doing? – Measuring waterways, drawing maps of the harbor's terrain and waterways. This excellent deep-water inner harbor attracted this group of colonialists. They understood that behind this port lay the rich Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. If they occupied this port and built railways to connect it with the interior, then it would be possible for them to carve up and exploit half of China's south and southwest. In 1898, French colonialists indeed sent warships to occupy this port, threatening Emperor Guangxu to demarcate the area within a few hundred miles around the port as a "concession" and give it to them. The people disagreed and launched a heroic and fierce armed struggle against the enemy that lasted for more than a year.
    The people rose up to fight, and the Qing officials panicked. Tan Zhonglin, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, submitted a memorial to Emperor Guangxu, seeking instructions.
    But what to do? Emperor Guangxu had no idea either. On the twenty-first day of the first month of the following year, Emperor Guangxu received a memorial from Prince Qing Yikuang, who was in charge of foreign affairs, and he picked up his vermilion pen and wrote "As proposed." These two words officially leased Guangzhou Bay—which is now called Zhanjiang—a fine port, to French colonialists in October 1899.
    Today, "Go to the Zhanjiang construction site!" "Go to Zhanjiang Port!" has become a call with great magic. This is not because you can eat so many lychees, pineapples, and bananas here every day, but because you can come here to do extremely great things that our predecessors never dreamed of. In just two or three years, these brave pioneers and builders have transformed Zhanjiang Port. They have made some brides who married away lose their way when they returned to their parents' home a few months later. They dredged inner and outer channels, built docks and warehouses, opened a civil aviation airport, built railways and highways, built power plants and water plants... New roads, new residential areas, industrial areas, and cultural areas, the construction of new seaside cultural parks, and the planting of every ornamental tree on the tree-lined roads are all carried out in accordance with urban construction plans. People are very surprised: there are passenger trains with soft and hard sleeper berths running between Hengyang and Zhanjiang every day; there are four regular civil aviation flights between Guangzhou and Zhanjiang every week; there are regular freighters with a load capacity of several thousand tons sailing to Guangzhou every five days; this is not enough, the road network extending to the east, west, north, and south sends more than hundreds of long-distance passenger and freight cars to various places every day. Seeing a modern port city that is most closely connected with the economies and cultures of Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asian countries suddenly standing in front of us! All this happened in such a short period of time, it is a bit unimaginable.
    This subtropical port city is so beautiful and so charming. Now, the people have the fate of the port in their own hands and want to build it more beautiful and magnificent, and will no longer allow the enemy to stick its aggressive pig snout in here.
    The people's Zhanjiang Port cannot be without a railway. Let's build a railway. A well-known general who used to work on the railway when he was young was sent to complete this task. The general led tens of thousands of railway soldiers from the borders of the northwest and northeast to the construction site of the Yuegui Border Railway. In the plains of eastern Guangxi and the Leizhou Peninsula, they were assisted by more than 100,000 migrant workers, and after nine months, they built a high-quality railway with a main line of 314 kilometers ahead of schedule. The eucalyptus trees planted on both sides of the railway protect the people's railway in formations of four longitudinal teams each. Beautiful, magnificent, making people feel refreshed and indescribably happy. This railway is like a giant, stretching its arms to the blue sea of Guangzhou Bay, embracing the entire Zhanjiang Port in its arms. Since the beginning of history, this is the first time that we Chinese have built a railway extending to the South China Sea. Su Dongpo, who lived in that era, certainly could not have dreamed of such a thing. The French colonialists had been entrenched here for half a century, but they did not do anything good either. Neither the emperors of previous dynasties, the imperialists, nor the Chiang gang could create any wealth for our people. “All are past and gone; to find men truly great, look to this age alone.” Today, we recite Chairman Mao's poem "Qinyuanchun" with proud feelings.
    Compared with other brother ports in the motherland, Zhanjiang Port has its own unique style. Tan Zhen, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the First Engineering Bureau of the General Bureau of Maritime Transportation Management, is an "old Tanggu" who has lived in Tianjin for more than 30 years. On his first day in Zhanjiang Port, he said to people, "I am so happy to come from a muddy water port to a clear water port!" Indeed, the seawater of Zhanjiang Port is azure blue and clear; because there are no rivers carrying sediment rushing into it in the port area. Outside the bay, Donghai Island and Jiezhou Island serve as its barriers, and in the typhoon-prone South China Sea, it is also an excellent typhoon shelter.
    From a natural good port to a modern commercial port, there is a complex transformation process in between. Transforming a natural harbor into a modern commercial port that fully meets the needs of domestic and foreign trade and transportation is a very arduous project. In order to allow giant ships of more than 10,000 tons to berth close to the wharf and unload or load huge amounts of cargo at the fastest speed, we must not only dredge the inner and outer channels, improve the navigation marks, build the wharves and warehouses, but more importantly, prepare all kinds of talents who can manage this transportation hub, and train skilled workers who can operate universal loaders, gantry cranes, and other machinery. Transforming nature and transforming people need to be carried out at the same time, which is not a simple matter.
    Now, Zhanjiang Port is like an unfinished outstanding oil painting. In this oil painting adorned with phoenix trees, coconut trees, stone chestnut trees, pot rack trees, silver flower trees, and eucalyptus trees, under the management of the craftsmen, its appearance and color are changing every day. These Lingnan trees are evergreen all year round. The phoenix tree grows even taller and more beautiful. Every May and June, the umbrella-like green leaves are covered with red flowers. From a distance, it looks like red flags are fluttering all over the city. Because the sea breeze disperses the heat on the ground, summer here is better than in large inland cities. Before the urban construction plan was drawn up, many agencies were vying to apply for coastal land at the eastern end of the port area to build office buildings and dormitories. A Soviet expert did not advocate doing this. He said that the characteristic of a coastal city is to allow citizens and travelers from all over the world to see the sea and contact the sea. Why use rows of agency houses to block people's vision and prevent people from fully appreciating the sea view and enjoying the benefits of the sea during their rest? How considerate and caring this expert is! Thanks to this expert's suggestion, the people of Zhanjiang will have a seaside cultural park to be proud of, where people can rest, visit, or swim to their heart's content.

    旧闻新事话湛江
    本报特约记者　黄谷柳
    湛江在哪里呢？
    住在五岭以北的人们，熟悉这个地方的是不多的。
    在很久以前，宋朝有一个皇帝，曾经把一个他不喜欢的诗人放逐到这个边远的地方来。这个诗人从广东珠江口的崖门，乘了一只帆船，驶到雷州半岛东北角的蜂腰部，在湛川县的一个港口舍舟登陆，前往雷州府，然后越过琼州海峡到海南岛去。这个诗人在雷州半岛到海南岛的途中，一边饱尝亚热带地区盛产的水果，一边作诗题字，赞赏这里物产的丰富。人们还记得他写的这两句诗句：
    日啖荔枝三百颗，
    不辞长作岭南人。
    这个诗人名字叫苏东坡。他在雷州半岛舍舟登陆的地方，就是如今的湛江港。很显然，在诗人的心目中，这些地方是魅人的，叫人留恋的。
    从那个时候起，又过去了好几百年，到了满清康熙皇帝统治的期间，也就是公元1661年，有一只叫做“安非特理号”的法国商船，被一阵台风刮到这个港口搁浅了。船上坐的是法国的商人、海盗，一群野心不浅的殖民主义者。他们在湛江港上陆，一住就是六个多月。干什么呢？——测量水道，画海港地形图和水路图。这个优良的深水内港，把这群殖民主义者吸引住了。他们明白：这个港口的背后是富饶的广东、广西、湖南、贵州、云南、四川。如果占据这个港口，修了通内地的铁路，那么中国的华南和西南半壁河山，就有可能任凭他们宰割和剥削了。1898年，法国殖民主义者果然派了兵船来占据这个港口，威胁光绪皇帝把这港口内外方圆几百里的地方划为“租界”，送给他们。老百姓不同意，掀起了持续一年多的英勇壮烈的武装抗敌斗争。
    人民起来抗战，满清官员慌了手脚。两广总督谭钟麟向光绪皇帝奏上一本，请示机宜。
    但究竟如何是好？光绪皇帝也没个主意。到了第二年的正月二十一日，光绪皇帝接到总理各国事务的庆亲王奕劻一个奏本，他就拿起朱笔，批了“依拟”两个字。这两个字，就正式把广州湾——也就是今天叫做湛江的优良港口，在1899年10月租让给法国殖民主义者了。
    今天，“到湛江工地去！”“到湛江海港去！”成了一种具有极大魔力的号召。这并不是因为到这里来每天可以吃多少荔枝、多少菠萝和香蕉，而是因为到这里来做我们的前人做梦也没有想到过的极其伟大的事业。这些勇敢的拓荒者和建设者，在短短两三年的时间内，使湛江港变了样。他们使得一些嫁出门去的新娘子，几个月后再回娘家来就迷失了方向。他们挖掘了内外航道，修建了码头和仓库，开辟了民航飞机场，建筑了铁路和公路，盖了发电厂和自来水厂……。新的马路，新的住宅区，工业区和文化区，新的海滨文化公园的兴建和林荫道上的每一棵风景树的种植，都是按照城市建设规划进行的。人们非常惊诧：衡阳和湛江之间每天竟有挂软硬席卧铺的旅客列车互相对开；广州和湛江之间每周竟有四次定期的民航飞机飞行；每五天有定期的载重几千吨的班轮开往广州；这还不够，向东西南北伸展出去的公路网，每天向各地发出去的长途客货汽车竟多达百辆以上。眼看一座跟欧洲、非洲和东南亚各国经济文化连系最近的近代化海港城市，突然屹立在我们的面前了！这一切都发生在这样短的时间里，真有点使人难以想像。
    这座亚热带的海港城市是这样美丽、这样魅人。现在，人民把海港的命运掌握在自己的手里，要把它建筑得更美丽、更雄壮，再也不容敌人把侵略的猪嘴伸进来了。
    人民的湛江港，不能没有一条铁路。咱们就来修一条铁路。一位赫赫有名的、年轻时曾经在铁路上干过活的将军被派来完成这个任务。将军率领了几万铁道兵，从西北、东北的国境边上，赶到粤桂边铁路线工地来。他们在桂东平原和雷州半岛一带，得到了十万以上的民工的协助，经过九个月的时间，就把一条正线三百一十四公里长的、质量很好的铁路提前修筑成功了。在铁路两侧种的桉树，各以四路纵队的阵势保护着这条人民的铁路。美丽，壮观，叫人看到心旷神怡，说不出来的欢喜。这条铁路活像一个巨人，把臂膀伸到湛蓝的广州湾的海边，把湛江港整个地搂在自己的怀抱里。从有历史以来，咱们中国人自己修建起伸展到南海边的铁路，这还是第一次。苏东坡活着的那个时代，当然梦想不到这样的事情。法国殖民主义者在这里盘据了半个世纪，更是一件好事也没有干。不管是历朝皇帝，帝国主义者和蒋帮，都不可能给我们人民创造什么财富。“俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝。”今天我们是怀着自豪的感情来诵读毛主席的“沁园春”这首词的。
    湛江港跟祖国的其他兄弟港相比，有它自己独特的风貌。海运管理总局第一工程局副局长兼总工程师谭真同志是个“老塘沽”，他在天津呆了三十多年了，到湛江港的头一天就对人说：“从浑水港来到清水港，真开心！”的确，湛江港的海水是湛蓝的、清澈的；因为港湾一带没有河流夹着泥沙向它冲击。港湾外边有东海岛和碣洲岛作它的屏障，在多台风的南海，它又是一个优良的避风港。
    从天然的良港到现代化的商港，中间有一个复杂的改造过程。把自然形态的港湾改造成完全符合国内外贸易交通需要的现代化商港，工程是很艰巨的。让万吨以上的巨轮能紧靠码头，并且以最快的速度卸下或装上巨量的货物，我们不仅要把内外航道疏浚好，把航标做好，把码头和仓库建筑好，更重要的是要把能管理这个交通运输枢纽的种种人材准备好，把驾驶万能装卸机、门式起重机等等机械的技术工人训练好。改造自然和改造人需要同时进行，这就不是一件简单的事情。
    现在，湛江港就仿佛是一幅没有完成的出色的油画。在这幅有着凤凰树，椰子树、石栗树、盆架子树、银华树和桉树点缀着的油画里，在匠师们的经营下面，它的面貌和颜色在天天改变着。这些岭南树木是四季常青的。凤凰树更长得挺秀，每逢五、六月间，在罗伞似的绿叶上面，长满了红花，远远看去，好像满城飘舞着红旗。因为海风吹散了地面上的热气，这里的夏天比内地大城市要好过一些。在城市建筑规划图还没有画好的时候，不少机关都争着要请领港区码头东端的海岸地皮来建筑办公楼和宿舍。一位苏联专家不主张这样做。他说，海滨城市的特点就是要让市民和各地来的旅客能看到海和接触到海，为什么要用一排排机关的房子堵住人们的视线，不让人们在休息的时候充分地欣赏海景和享受海的利益呢？这位专家多么体贴人和关心人啊！由于这位专家的建议，湛江人民将有一个可以自豪的海滨文化公园，人们在公园里可以尽情休息、游览或游泳。（未完）（附图片）
