    The typhoon alert, which began on August 2nd, was lifted on the 4th. This irresistible natural disaster has caused some loss of life and property in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and the cities of Shanghai and Hangzhou. However, thanks to the relatively adequate preventative measures taken in advance by various regions, the damage caused by this natural disaster has been greatly reduced to the extent possible. Now, the State Council has issued an urgent directive, calling on the areas affected by the typhoon to intensify rescue and relief efforts. This is a very urgent task.
    The ferocity of this typhoon, the strength of its winds, and the depth of its penetration inland are rare occurrences in the past fifty years. The organization and planning shown by the people in various regions in fighting the typhoon are also rarely seen. The Party and government leading bodies in the aforementioned provinces and cities, based on the typhoon warnings issued by the Central Meteorological Research Institute, made meticulous plans and deployments in advance, mobilizing huge amounts of manpower and material resources to fight against the fierce winds and torrential rains for two or three days and nights. Shanghai organized a 150,000-strong defense force against the typhoon, guarding dikes, protecting warehouses, repairing dangerous houses, and rescuing residents in distress. Therefore, although this typhoon that struck Shanghai was more violent than the one in 1949, the losses it caused were much smaller than in 1949. Other provinces and cities, like Shanghai, made the greatest efforts to defend against the typhoon, taking all possible measures to greatly reduce the damage the typhoon inflicted on the people. However, the losses caused by the typhoon's impact on more than a dozen coastal and riverine provinces and cities are still not to be ignored. To eliminate all the serious consequences caused by the typhoon, the Party and government leading bodies and the broad masses of the people in the affected areas need to continue to make even greater efforts.
    The most urgent task at present is to appease the affected residents. Although the number of casualties caused by this typhoon is not large, the number of affected residents is considerable. The dead must be buried, the injured must be treated, new homes must be arranged for those whose houses have been destroyed, and food must be provided to those who have difficulty making a living. These specific and meticulous tasks must be done in a timely manner. Various provinces and cities have already paid great attention to this work. For example, Jiangsu Province has formed four慰问 groups, led by responsible cadres such as the Deputy Governor, to go to various areas affected by the typhoon to conduct慰问, relief, and other work. Shanghai has prepared temporary resettlement stations for the victims whose homes were destroyed, and has also issued relief funds to those who have difficulty making a living. The central government is very concerned about the disaster situation in these provinces. The State Council has urged the People's Committees of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Shanghai to list rescue and relief work as one of the central tasks at present; at the same time, it has decided to send four working groups to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shanghai to understand the situation and assist in the work. To comfort and provide relief to the affected people, it is necessary not only to ensure that they have food to eat now, but also to ensure that they have food to eat in the future. That is to say, it is necessary not only to help them solve their living problems, but also to help them solve their production problems. Self-reliance through production and mutual assistance are still the fundamental ways to solve disaster relief problems.
    Restoring production in the disaster areas is a very important task. This typhoon has had little impact on industrial production in the disaster areas, but agricultural production in some areas has suffered considerable losses: tall-stalk crops have been blown down, vine crops have been broken, rice in low-lying areas has been washed away, and vegetables in the suburbs of cities have rotted. Emergency measures must be taken to make up for these losses; otherwise, the agricultural production increase plans in these areas will be difficult to complete. The Chinese people have rich experience in fighting floods. As long as the broad masses of farmers are mobilized, and their opinions are fully listened to and respected, drainage should be carried out where drainage is needed, and replanting should be carried out where replanting is needed. Because the season is not too late, it is entirely possible to find ways to remedy the situation and further reduce losses. Many agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Shanghai immediately convened symposiums with experienced farmers after the typhoon to discuss ways to make up for vegetable losses. They are doing it perfectly correctly.
    This typhoon has caused varying degrees of flooding in many provinces. According to the meteorological station's forecast, there may be rain in parts of Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi in the coming days, and the flood season in other provinces has not yet passed. Therefore, fighting floods is still a major task in many areas in the next month. In order to successfully complete the 1956 agricultural production increase plan, we must carry forward the tenacious spirit of fighting the typhoon and continue to work hard to overcome floods.

### 消除台风造成的灾害

    消除台风造成的灾害
    本月二日开始的台风警报已于四日解除。这场不可抗拒的自然灾害，在浙江、江苏、安徽、河南、河北等省区和上海、杭州等城市造成了一些生命财产的损失。但是，由于各个地区事先进行了比较充分的防御工作，已在可能的范围内大大地减少了这一场天灾的为害。现在国务院发出紧急指示，号召在台风侵袭过的地方，加紧进行抢救和善后工作。这是非常迫切的任务。
    这场台风来势之猛，风力之强，进入内陆之深，是五十年来所少见的。各地人民和台风作斗争所表现的组织性、计划性，也是很少有的。上面说的这些省、市的党政领导机关，根据中央气象科学研究所发布的台风警报，事先作了周密的计划和部署，调动巨大的人力和物力，和狂风暴雨作了两三昼夜的斗争。上海市组成十五万人的防御台风大军，守卫堤防，防护仓库，抢修危险的房屋，救护遇险的居民。因此，这次袭击上海的台风虽比1949年的更加凶猛，它所造成的损失却比1949年的小得多。别的省、市也和上海一样，为防御台风作了最大的努力，采取一切可能的办法，使台风给予人民的损害大大减轻。但是，这次沿海沿江十几个省市因受台风的侵袭而引起的损失仍然是不可忽视的。要消除台风造成的一切严重的后果，还需要各受灾地区的党政领导机关和广大人民继续进行更大的努力。
    目前最迫切的任务是安抚受灾的居民。这场台风造成的生命伤亡虽然不多，受灾的居民却为数不少。死亡的要埋葬，受伤的要治疗，毁掉房屋的要安排新居，生活困难的要救济粮米。这些具体的细致的工作，都要及时作好。对于这项工作，各个省、市都已予以很大的注意。如江苏省，已经组成四个慰问组，由副省长等负责干部率领，分别到受台风灾害的各个地区，进行慰问、救济等工作。上海市给房屋被毁的灾民准备了临时的安居站，还给他们当中生活困难的发了救济金。中央十分关怀这些省区的灾情。国务院已经督促浙江、江苏、安徽、河南、河北、山东、福建、江西、湖南、湖北等省和上海市人民委员会，把抢救和善后工作列为当前中心工作之一；同时决定派出四个工作组，分别到浙江、江苏、安徽、河南四省和上海市了解情况，协助工作。对于受灾的人民进行安抚救济，不仅要使他们现在有饭吃，而且要使他们将来有饭吃。这就是说，不仅要帮助他们解决生活问题，而且要帮助他们解决生产问题。生产自救，互助互济，仍然是我们解决救灾问题的根本办法。
    恢复灾区的生产，是十分重大的任务。这场台风对受灾地区的工业生产影响不大，但某些地区的农业生产却受了相当严重的损失：高秆作物被吹倒了，藤蔓作物被吹断了，低洼地区的水稻漂没了，城市郊区的蔬菜腐烂了。必须采取紧急措施弥补这些损失，否则，这些地区的农业增产计划势将难以完成。我国人民有同水灾作斗争的丰富经验，只要把广大农民发动起来，充分听取和尊重他们的意见，该排水的排水，该补种的补种，因为季节还不算晚，完全可能设法补救，进一步减少损失。上海郊区许多农业生产合作社在台风过后，立即召开老农座谈会，商量弥补蔬菜损失的办法，他们作得完全正确。
    这场台风给不少省份造成程度不同的水灾，据气象台预测，河北、河南、山西部分地区近日还可能有雨，其他省区的汛期还未过去。因此，同洪水作斗争，仍然是近一个月内许多地区的重大任务。为了胜利完成1956年的农业增产计划，我们一定要发扬同台风战斗的顽强精神，继续努力战胜洪水。
