    On a New Stairway

    A Trip Through the "Factory Zone"
    We visited the Czech region of Czechoslovakia for a month. For more than ten days, we left Prague and traveled more than a thousand li in seven states. Our journey was almost entirely in Czechoslovakian-made, highly efficient cars, driving on good roads paved with asphalt and stone.
    
    It was the colorful month of May, when a hundred flowers were in bloom. The bright cherry blossoms along the roads swayed in the spring breeze, and in the distance were picturesque river valleys. The rugged rocks were covered with lush green groves, and golden wheat fields stretched across the slopes between the river and the road. We admired the charming scenery of this beautiful country.
    
    But soon, we discovered an even more significant feature. As we left one city and headed for another, we first passed through the suburbs, where factory chimneys were usually smoking or mine hoists were turning. Nearby were multi-story workers' dormitories. No more than half an hour's drive, we would encounter a smaller city, where you would again find factories, mines, and workers' housing. Perhaps after another five minutes, you would see a village, but not in the usual sense. There were well-paved stone streets and two- or three-story houses. Along the streets, mothers pushed baby carriages just like those seen in Prague. Larger villages even had cinemas. Here lived members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, as well as workers from factories or mines near the village. You would encounter such villages every few minutes. After about two or three hours, we would reach a large industrial center, like Pilsen, Brno, or Ostrava.
    
    Of course, if we were looking for the differences between city and countryside, it would still be easy to find them. For example, it would be impossible to have an opera house in a village, and a few percent of remote mountain villages were not yet electrified. But the distance between city and countryside had become much smaller. This was not only because many rural residents had running water and electric stoves in their homes, but also because factories and mines scattered like stars were linking the entire Czech region together. The working class accounted for the majority of the population, and the influence and strength of the working class could be felt everywhere.
    
    Some say that the entire Czech region is a large machine factory. This time, it was as if we had taken a meaningful long journey through a "factory zone."
    
    The Level Already Reached
    In the Czech region, we visited more than a dozen industrial enterprises. Each enterprise not only far surpassed the production records of the bourgeois republic era in terms of quantity, but also greatly exceeded the quality and variety of products during the bourgeois rule.
    
    In the huge Lenin Factory in Pilsen, we saw a 5,000-ton hydraulic press being produced. The Czechoslovak comrade who led us on the tour said that another 12,000-ton giant hydraulic press had been installed in the new steel plant in Ostrava. To be honest, I had neither seen nor heard of a 12,000-ton hydraulic press before. In pre-liberation old China, a 1,000-ton hydraulic press was already considered large. Soon, we arrived in Ostrava and saw this behemoth in the forging workshop of the new steel plant. It was twenty meters high (equal to the height of a six-story building), and the large workshop of several thousand square meters was almost set up for it. When we went, it was working with a thunderous roar.
    
    This factory also produces vertical lathes with a diameter of twelve meters, which are indispensable cutting tools for manufacturing large turbine generators. However, the comrades at the Lenin Factory were not satisfied with their existing achievements. They were already preparing to produce larger vertical lathes with a diameter of twenty-two meters. In the bourgeois era, they would not have dared to dream of even a vertical lathe with a diameter of twelve meters.
    
    The new Spartak-brand cars produced by the Boleslav Automobile Factory are so popular that even the most discerning French are rushing to order them from this factory. Austrian merchants complained that there were too few of these new cars being shipped to them. We visited this factory for four hours and saw the entire process from parts production to car assembly. Comrades at the factory told us that a new factory building, much larger than the current one, would soon begin construction on the open space next to the old factory. By 1960, production would be one and a half times higher than it is now.
    
    In the Tatra passenger car factory in Prague, several fully assembled, magnificent carriages were being cleaned and the glass was being washed, ready for shipment. Deputy Director Ulba told us that this was an order from Turkey. Turkey ordered a hundred such carriages, seventy of which had already been shipped to Istanbul via Romania. After seeing them, the Turks said, "There is nothing to fault; they are world-class."
    
    There is no need to give more examples. For instance, Czech precision machine tools or electric trains have already reached first-class levels, which is already well known to many people.
    
    The lackeys of Western imperialists once used all sorts of conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to shake the Czechoslovak people's confidence in building socialism. Now they have completely failed because the people not only see the windows of state-owned stores filled with all kinds of inexpensive Czechoslovakian products, from nylon stockings to electric refrigerators, but they also feel from their daily lives that the people's democratic system is much better than the capitalist system. Based on the development of production, the people's lives have greatly improved compared to the First Republic era. Such figures are not meaningless: in 1937, adults and children together consumed an average of 80.6 kilograms of flour, 24 kilograms of sugar, and 26.8 kilograms of meat per year. In 1955, adults and children together consumed an average of 152 kilograms of flour, 33 kilograms of sugar, and 36 kilograms of meat per year. In the capitalist era, it was not easy for ordinary farmers to buy a bicycle, but now it is not uncommon for a village to have dozens of motorcycle-powered bicycles.
    
    We were guests in the home of miner Negola Adolf in Ostrava and carefully inspected the spacious, modernized four-room apartment he lived in. If only his family or a few miners lived here, it might not be a big deal, but in this newly built six-story residential area with elevators in each building, 5,000 mining and metallurgical workers' families, totaling 20,000 people, have already moved in. This place is called Broba, which is part of the new Ostrava district. Adolf is an underground coal miner. In the not-so-distant past, he lived alone in a dilapidated house with nothing. He fully understands the relationship between increasing production and the country and himself. He exceeds his production plan every month. He is a production expert and a member of the mine district club. His greatest hobbies are stamp collecting and playing puppet shows. He is very interested in Chinese shadow puppetry.
    
    On a New Stairway
    Never be satisfied with the level already reached. Today must be higher than yesterday, and tomorrow must be better than today. Now, the Czechoslovak people are confidently advancing towards a new and great goal, which is to build socialism in the second Five-Year Plan and catch up with the most developed capitalist countries in the West in terms of industrial output per capita and in all aspects of technological development.
    
    The new Five-Year Plan, starting in 1956, is actually a plan for new technological development, a grand plan to lead Czechoslovakia onto the path of full mechanization (creating preconditions for automation), electrification, and chemicalization.
    
    The characteristics of the new Five-Year Plan are: to increase the entire industrial production by 50%, to reduce production costs by 16%. Ninety percent of the methods to achieve this level rely on the improvement of labor productivity, which means mainly relying on the development of new technologies and the further mastery of new technologies by the entire working class. The people's democratic state provides financial guarantees. During the second Five-Year Plan, the state's financial investment is 152.6 billion crowns, almost doubling that of the first Five-Year Plan.
    
    The Czechoslovak people, located at the western end of the socialist camp, are engaging in peaceful competition with the West. "Catching up with the most advanced capitalist countries in the West in terms of industrial output per capita" is not a fantasy, nor is it just a calculation based on numbers. A strong industrial base, coupled with the Czechoslovak people's determination to build socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party and the boundless wisdom of the working class, makes it realistic to catch up with the Western capitalist world in major industrial sectors such as steel, electricity, coal, and machinery before 1960. The people of the West have seen and will continue to see how much vitality socialism has in this people's democratic country closest to them, and how many benefits it brings to the people.
    
    However, to realize such a grand plan is not an easy task. The Czechoslovak people understand that they must also use perseverance to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead. For example, to put industry on a new basis of full mechanization and production specialization, it is necessary to adjust the production structure and equipment, which is a huge and complex task. Furthermore, the technical level of Czechoslovak industry is already very high. We have seen in some enterprises that there is one technician for every five or so production workers. However, to catch up with and surpass the West in all aspects of technology, further improvement is still needed, especially to improve the large number of intermediate technicians.
    
    The optimistic and wise Czechoslovak people not only have the confidence to overcome difficulties, but they have already launched heroic and creative labor on the new stairway.
    
    In the Semily textile factory, the experimental production of air-jet shuttleless looms has achieved good results. We came to this 55-year-old textile factory, and in its carding workshop, we could even see machines produced in 1893. However, right next to them, the most modern looms in the world have appeared, and we have seen female workers who can skillfully operate these machines. Since mankind learned to weave, from the oldest wooden looms to modern automatic looms, it has never been without a shuttle. Now the loom is about to bid farewell to the shuttle, and a new shuttleless loom factory is about to be established in Semily. The second Five-Year Plan stipulates that 2,000 of these looms will be produced and equipped nationwide. The shuttleless loom can make 400 weft insertions per minute, while the best modern automatic shuttle loom can only make 170 weft insertions per minute, increasing production efficiency by more than double.
    
    A series of hydroelectric power stations have begun construction, and the power station at the Slapy dam on the Vltava River has already begun generating electricity. A larger hydroelectric power station is under construction at Orlík and will generate electricity in 1960, one year ahead of schedule. Large thermal power plants with high temperature and high pressure will also be established. Czechoslovakia's boiler manufacturing, especially automatic welding technology, has reached a very high level, and it is not difficult to manufacture ultra-high temperature and ultra-high pressure equipment. By 1960, nearly a thousand kilometers of railways nationwide will be electrified, and household electricity consumption will increase by 50%. At that time, the per capita electricity production will be 1,840 kilowatt-hours per year (currently it is 1,140 kilowatt-hours). This figure will exceed the level of West Germany, Belgium, and France, which are very developed in electricity production (this calculation is based on the projected development level of West Germany, Belgium, and France in five years). It would take fifty years for such a rate of growth to be achieved in the bourgeois republic.
    
    In the past decade, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Republic Government, the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of Czechoslovakia have created many achievements that were impossible to achieve during the bourgeois rule. Under the mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries, the Czechoslovak people are now on a new stairway, advancing towards new socialist peaks.

    在新的阶梯上
    张沛
    “工厂区”内的旅行
    在捷克斯洛伐克的捷克地区我们访问了一个月。其中有十多天，曾经离开布拉格，在七个州内旅行了一千多里。我们的旅程几乎全部是乘着捷克斯洛伐克自己生产的效率很好的小汽车，在铺着柏油和石块的良好的公路上驶行。
    这时，正是百花盛开的彩色的五月，公路两旁鲜艳的樱桃花在春风中摆动，远处有风景如画的河谷，嶙嶙的岩石上长满了翠绿的小树林，小河与公路之间的坡地上，铺展着一片金黄色的麦田，我们赞赏着这个美丽的国家的迷人的风光。
    可是不久，我们就发现了一个更有意义的特色。当我们离开一个城市向另一个城市出发时，首先经过城市的郊区，这里通常总有工厂的烟囱在冒烟或者矿井的卷扬机在辘辘转动，附近排列着多层建筑的工人宿舍。汽车的行程不超过半小时，我们又会遇到一个较小的城市，你在这里又会发现工厂、矿山和工人住宅。也许再走上五分钟，就会见到一个村庄，可是这不是我们通常概念中的村庄。这儿有铺得很好的石头街道，有两、三层楼的住宅，街道两旁，母亲们推着像在布拉格看到的一样的婴儿小推车，较大的村子还有电影院。在这里，住着农业生产合作社的社员，也住着村庄附近的工厂或矿山的工人。像这样的村庄，走几分钟就会遇见一个。大约过了两三个小时，我们就会到达一个大的工业中心，像比尔森、布尔诺、俄斯特拉发这样的大城市。
    自然，如果我们在这里寻找城市与乡村的区别还是很容易找到的，比如在村庄内还不可能有歌剧院，在百分之二、三的偏僻山村里还没有电气化，可是城市与乡村的距离已经小得多了。这不仅是因为许多乡村居民的家里有自来水、电灶，而且星罗棋布的工厂和矿山正在把整个捷克联成一片，工人阶级占了人口中的多数，到处感觉到工人阶级的影响和力量。
    有人说，整个捷克是一个大机器工厂，那末这一次，我们好像是在一个“工厂区”内，作了一次有意义的长途旅行。
    已经达到的水平
    在捷克地区，我们访问了十几个工业企业，每一个企业不仅在生产数量上把资产阶级共和国时代的生产纪录远远地摔在后面，而且在产品的品种、质量方面，也大大地超过了资产阶级统治时期。
    在比尔森巨大的列宁工厂里，我们看见了正在生产的五千吨的大水压机，领我们参观的捷克斯洛伐克同志说，另一个一万二千吨的巨型水压机，已经安装在俄斯特拉发的新钢厂里。说实话，以前我既没有看见过也没有听说过有一万二千吨的水压机，在解放前的旧中国，一千吨的水压机已经是很大的了。不久，我们到了俄斯特拉发，在新钢厂的锻压车间内，看见了这个庞然大物，它有二十公尺高（等于六层楼房的高度），这个几千平方公尺的大车间，差不多就是为它设立的。我们去时，它正在轰隆轰隆像雷鸣一样地工作着。
    就在这个工厂内还生产着直径十二公尺的立式车床，这种车床是制造大型透平发电机必不可少的切削工具。可是列宁工厂的同志们丝毫不满足已有的成就，他们已经在准备生产直径二十二公尺的更大的立式车床了。而在资产阶级时代，连直径十二公尺的立式车床也不敢梦想的。
    波莱斯拉夫汽车工厂出产的斯巴达克牌的新型小汽车，连最爱讲究的法国人，也争着向这个厂订货。奥地利的商人抱怨运给他们的这种新型汽车太少。我们曾在这个工厂访问了四个小时，看了从零件生产到汽车装配的整个过程。工厂的同志告诉我们，一个新的比现在的工厂规模大得多的新厂房，就要在旧厂旁边的空地上开始建筑。到1960年，产量将比现在提高一倍半。
    在布拉格的塔塔尔客车车厢工厂内，几节已完全装配好的华美车厢正在打扫和擦洗玻璃，准备外运。副厂长乌尔巴同志告诉我们这是土耳其的订货。土耳其订了一百个这样的车厢，其中七十个已经通过罗马尼亚运到伊斯坦布尔，土耳其人看了以后说：“找不到什么缺点，是世界第一流的货色”。
    用不着再举更多的例子，比如捷克的精密机床或者是电气火车等等，已经达到头等水平，这已经是很多人都知道的了。
    西方帝国主义者的仆从们，曾经施用了各种阴谋诡计，企图动摇捷克斯洛伐克人民对建设社会主义的信心，现在他们彻底地失败了，因为人民不仅看到国营商店的橱窗内摆满了各种各样价格便宜的捷克斯洛伐克产品，从玻璃丝袜到电气冰箱，而且他们从每天的生活里，感觉得到人民民主制度要比资本主义制度好得多。在生产发展的基础上，人民的生活比起第一共和国时代，有了很大的提高，这样的数目字不是没有意义的：在1937年，大人小孩一起，每人每年平均消费面粉80.6公斤，糖24公斤，肉26.8公斤，而在1955年大人小孩一起，每人每年平均消费面粉152公斤，糖33公斤，肉36公斤。在资本主义时期，普通的农民买一辆自行车也并不是很容易的事，而现在一个村子有几十部摩托发动的机器脚踏车已不算稀奇。
    我们在俄斯特拉发的矿工内哥拉·阿道尔夫家中作过客，仔细参观过他住的这套宽敞的设备近代化的四个房间，如果只是他一户或者几户矿工在这儿住，或许算不了什么，可是在这片新建的六层高、每幢房屋设有电梯的住宅区内，已经住上了五千个采矿和冶金工人的家庭，他们的总数是二万人。这个地方叫布罗巴，是新俄斯特拉发区的一部分。阿道尔夫是井下的采煤工人，在并不遥远的过去，他光杆一人住在破屋里，什么也没有，他完全懂得提高生产对国家对自己的关系，他每月都超额完成生产计划。他是生产能手，又是矿区俱乐部的委员，他的最大的爱好是集邮和玩木偶戏，他对中国的皮影子戏很有兴趣。
     在新的阶梯上
    绝不满足于已经达到的水平，今天要比昨天升得更高，而明天比今天还要美好。现在，捷克斯洛伐克人民，正信心充沛地向着一个新的巨大的目标前进，这就是在第二个五年计划中建成社会主义，在按人口计算工业产量、在技术发展的各个方面，赶上西方工业最发达的资本主义国家。
    从1956年开始的新五年计划，实际上是一个新技术发展的计划，是把捷克斯洛伐克领进全盘机械化（为自动化创造前提）、电气化和化学化道路上的远大计划。
    新五年计划的特点是：整个工业生产要提高50％，生产成本降低16％，达到这个水平的方法，百分之九十是依靠劳动生产率的提高，这也就是说主要依靠新技术的发展，依靠全体工人阶级进一步掌握新技术。人民民主的国家从财政上给予保证，第二个五年计划期间国家财政投资1，526亿克朗，几乎超过第一个五年计划一倍。
    处在社会主义阵营西端的捷克斯洛伐克人民，正在和西方展开和平竞赛。“按人口计算工业产量赶上西方最先进的资本主义国家”并不是一个空想，也不仅仅是依靠数字的计算；强大的工业基础，加上捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党领导下建设社会主义的决心和工人阶级无限的智慧，使得在1960年以前，钢、电力、煤和机械等这些主要的工业部门赶上西方资本主义世界，有了现实的可能性。西方的人民已经看到并且将继续看到离他们最近的这一个人民民主国家，社会主义有着多么大的生命力，给人民带来了多么大的好处。
    但是要实现这样一个远大的计划，并不是一件轻而易举的事，捷克斯洛伐克人民懂得还必须用坚忍的毅力去战胜前进道路上的困难。比如要把工业放在全盘机械化和生产专门化的新基础上，就要调整生产结构和设备，这是一件巨大而复杂的工作。再比如，捷克斯洛伐克工业的技术水平已经很高，我们看到一些企业中，每五个左右的生产工人，就有一个技术人员，但是要在技术的各方面赶上西方，赛过西方，还需要有进一步的提高，特别是要提高那些数量很大的中等技术人员。
    乐观而智慧的捷克斯洛伐克人民，不仅有信心克服困难，而且他们已经在新的阶梯上展开了英勇的创造性的劳动。
    在塞米利城的纺织工厂里，喷气式无梭织布机车间的试验性的生产已经收到良好效果。我们曾经来到这个有着五十五年历史的纺织厂，在它的梳棉车间里，甚至还能见到1893年出产的机器，然而就在它的旁边，出现了目前世界上最新式的织布机，我们看到女工们已能熟练地操纵这种机器。人类自从学会了织布以来，从最古老的木机到近代的自动织布机，从来没有离开过梭子，而现在织布机要同梭子告别了，一个新的无梭织布机工厂就要在塞米利城建立起来。第二个五年计划规定要在全国生产和装备两千台这种织布机。无梭织布机每分钟能打纬四百次，而现代最好的自动有梭织布机，每分钟只能打纬一百七十次，生产效率能提高一倍多。
    一系列的水电站已经开始兴建，弗尔塔瓦河上的斯拉皮水闸的电站已经开始发电。一个更大的水电站正在奥利克建筑，将比原计划提前一年在1960年发电。高温高压的大型火力发电站也将建立起来，捷克斯洛伐克的锅炉制造特别是自动焊接技术已经达到很高的水平，制造超高温超高压的设备，也不是什么困难的事了。到1960年，全国又将有近千公里的铁路电气化，家庭用电将增加50％，那时，按人口计算电的产量，每人每年将分配到1，840度（现在是1，140度），这个数字将超过世界上电力生产很发达的西德，比利时和法国的水平（这个计算是预计了西德、比利时、法国在五年中发展后的水平得出来的）。这个增长的速度，在资产阶级共和国需要五十年才能办到。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工人、农民、知识分子，在过去的十年中，在共产党和共和国政府的领导下，已经创造了许许多多资产阶级统治时期不可能达到的成就。在社会主义阵营各国互助合作下，现在捷克斯洛伐克人民处在一个新的阶梯上，向着新的社会主义的高峰前进。
