	All-Union Games Introduction
	Today, August 5th, the flag of the All-Union Games will be raised over the "Sports City" at the foot of the Lenin Hills in Moscow. Nine thousand six hundred outstanding athletes from the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union will participate in the Games. There will be twenty-two events: track and field, boxing, swimming, basketball, football, volleyball, tennis, rowing, shooting, and so on.
	To welcome the All-Union Games, a nationwide relay race with 800,000 participants began more than a month ago. The relay race includes various events such as motorcycle, bicycle, running, and rowing, divided into eight routes, ending in Moscow. The eight starting points are located in the border cities of the Soviet Union in the southeast, northwest, and northeast, the longest route being from Vladivostok to Moscow, passing through Siberia and the Urals, a distance of 10,000 kilometers. When the Games open, these eight relay race armies will also converge in Moscow's "Sports City."
	This Games is the largest sports event in the history of Soviet sports and is being held on the basis of unprecedented achievements in Soviet sports. During the year and a half of preparation for this Games, the republics held their respective sports meets, and all cities, villages, factories, and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union were swept up in a sports craze. During this period, thousands of new sports organizations emerged in the republics. According to incomplete statistics, 7,000 new sports organizations appeared in the Russian Federation alone, adding 700,000 new sports enthusiasts, with 12 million people participating in the competition. During the selection of athletes, the republics created 200 new All-Union records, 50 of which broke world records. Between 1955 and 1956, Soviet athletes created a total of 415 new All-Union records and 142 new world records. There are now 200 Muscovites who are holders of Soviet, European, and world titles. In the past year alone, Moscow's athletes have broken 139 All-Union records and 35 world records.
	The All-Union Games encourage people to exercise better and work hard in production. A motorcyclist from the "Lviv" locomotive repair factory in Ukraine won the right to participate in the relay race, but there was a decision: only outstanding producers and activists in sports work could participate. As a result, locksmith Solovey worked with doubled enthusiasm, completing 100% to 150% of his quota every day. On July 22nd, when this route of the relay race began, Solovey won the right to participate in the relay race by completing 345% of his monthly plan.
	Currently, there are 200,000 sports organizations in the Soviet Union, with more than 17.5 million people engaged in sports activities in these organizations. Soviet sports organizations are members of 30 international sports associations and have close ties with athletes from 50 countries. In the first seven months of this year, 84 sports groups from 20 countries visited the Soviet Union. During the same period, 121 Soviet sports delegations visited foreign countries. The growing sports ties between the Soviet Union and other countries promote the cause of peace and friendship between peoples of all countries.
	Soviet athletes continue to achieve excellent results in international competitions. For example, at the 7th Winter Olympics held at the beginning of this year, Soviet athletes won 26 gold medals, 5 silver medals, and 6 bronze medals, and the ice hockey players won the world championship. In May of this year, Soviet athletes also won the 9th International Cycling Competition.
	During the twelve days of the All-Union Games, the winners of the sports competitions representing the republics, Moscow, and Leningrad will receive All-Union champion gold medals. The team that wins three first places will receive a crystal cup awarded by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. Athletes who achieve excellent results will be selected for the Soviet delegation to participate in the 16th Olympic Games in Australia this autumn. (Fang)

    全苏运动大会介绍
    今天，八月五日，在莫斯科列宁山下“体育城”的上空将竖起全苏运动大会的旗帜。全苏联十五个加盟共和国的九千六百名优秀选手将参加大会比赛。比赛项目为二十二种：田径、拳击、游泳、篮球、足球、排球、网球、划船和射击等等。
    为了迎接全苏运动大会，早在一个多月以前，就开始了有八十万人参加的全苏接力赛。接力赛包括摩托车、自行车、跑步、划船等多种比赛项目，共分八路，终点是莫斯科，八个起点分布在苏联东南西北的边疆城市，其中最远的一路是从海参崴到莫斯科，中间经过西伯利亚、乌拉尔，长达一万公里。当这个运动大会开幕的时候，这八路接力赛大军也将在莫斯科的“体育城”会师。
    这次运动大会是苏联运动史上最大的一次运动会，也是在苏联运动获得空前成绩的基础上举行的一次运动会。在准备这次运动大会的一年半期间，各加盟共和国分别举行了运动会，全苏各城市、乡村，各工厂、集体农庄都卷入了体育运动的热潮。各共和国在这一期间出现了千百个新的体育团体，据不完全统计，仅俄罗斯联邦就出现了七千个新的体育团体，增加了七十万个新的运动爱好者，有一千二百万人参加了比赛。各共和国在选拔选手比赛时创造了二百个全苏新纪录，其中有五十个突破了世界纪录。1955到1956年间苏联运动员共创造了415次全苏新纪录和142次世界新纪录。现在有二百个莫斯科人是苏联、欧洲和世界冠军的保持者。仅去年一年，莫斯科的运动健将们就打破了一百三十九次全苏纪录，三十五次世界纪录。
    全苏运动大会鼓舞着人们更好地锻炼身体和努力生产。乌克兰“里沃夫”机车修理厂的摩托车手获得了参加接力赛的权利，可是有一个决定：只有优秀的生产者和体育工作的积极分子才能参加。于是，钳工索罗威伊以加倍的热情从事劳动，每天完成定额一倍到一倍半。七月二十二日，当这一路的接力赛开始的时候，索罗威伊以完成月计划345％的成绩获得了参加接力赛的权利。
    现在，全苏联共有二十万个体育组织，有一千七百五十多万人在这个体育组织里从事体育运动。苏联的体育组织是三十个国际体育协会的成员，同五十个国家的运动员有密切的联系。今年七个月内有二十个国家的八十四个体育团体访问了苏联，同时间内，121个苏联体育代表团到过外国。苏联和其他国家的日益扩大的体育联系促进着和平事业和各国人民间的友谊。
    苏联的运动健将们在国际比赛中不断获得优秀的成绩。例如，在今年年初举行的第七届冬季奥林匹克运动会上，苏联运动员得到了二十六枚金奖章，五枚银奖章和六枚铜奖章，冰球健将荣获世界冠军。今年五月在第九届国际自行车比赛中，苏联运动员也获得胜利。
    在十二天的全苏运动大会上，各加盟共和国、莫斯科和列宁格勒的代表队在运动比赛中获胜者将得到全苏冠军金质奖章。获得三项第一的队将得到苏联部长会议奖给的水晶杯。取得优良成绩的运动员将被选入苏联代表队，以便今年秋天去澳大利亚参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会。    （方）
