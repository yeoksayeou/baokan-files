In July, I took a car from Xigaze to Yadong and visited Yadong area, a corner of southern Tibet. When the car reached the Himalayan mountain pass nearly 5,000 meters high, Qomolhari, the third peak of the Himalayas, was dazzling with snow. At its foot, Lake Doje was as calm as a mirror, and white cranes often flew over the lake. To the north of the pass is a boundless wilderness. In the past, this place was sparsely populated, but now you can not only see cars coming and going, but also teams of rubber-wheeled horse-drawn carriages and mule teams with small colorful flags, making travel for merchants between the north and south of the Himalayas obviously more convenient than before. Going south from the pass, passing through Pali, known as the "highest city in the world," the terrain gradually descends by more than 2,000 meters, all the way down to the mild Yadon River Valley. On this day, I saw three kinds of natural landscapes in a row: from the weathered mountains where no grass grows to the shrub-covered areas, and then into the river valley with towering trees, their climates are also very different.

First Visit to Yadon

Entering a verdant narrow valley, you arrive at Yadong area. The natural environment and the residents' houses here are different from other areas of Tibet. The mountain slopes on both sides of the river valley are covered with wild roses, crabapples, and many wild flowers. Bees and butterflies dance among the flowers, and apple and peach trees in the village are laden with fruit. Due to the mild climate here, two crops can be planted a year. Now, the newly reclaimed farmland here has exceeded the original cultivated area. The highland barley in the terraced fields has already been harvested, more than two months earlier than in some other areas of Tibet. The People's Bank here has also issued two loans to the farmers in the valley.

Yadong is not a city with concentrated buildings. In this river valley, only Xiama and Renqinggang have small streets like towns. Since China and India signed the "Agreement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India" in Beijing, trade here has become more developed. When I came to Xiama, a new city was taking shape here. The newly built post and telecommunications building and Yadong Primary School will soon be completed. Following them will be the state-owned trading company, the People's Bank, and other buildings. Soon, a hydroelectric power plant will also be built here to meet the needs of developing small-scale industries and lighting.

Visiting the Yadon Forest Area

The Yadon River Valley, more than a hundred miles long, is a dense forest area. The famous Himalayan pine grows here, and many red and white pines have diameters of 60 to 80 centimeters and some are more than 20 meters high. The spruce and birch that grow here are also excellent building materials. In the past, few people had been to the forest. After the opening of the Jiangzi to Yadon highway, the forest resources were used for the first time to support the construction of central Tibet, and large quantities of wood were transported from here to Jiangzi and Xigaze. Now, a road leading to the forest area is extending into the depths of the forest. Tibetan loggers have also begun to grow up here. In addition to the people of Yadon and Pali, the loggers also include people from Lhasa, Xigaze, and Jiangzi, most of whom were farmers and herdsmen who could not make a living in the past. Now, the Tibetan people in the Yadong area are actively protecting the country's forest. The Yadong Forest Protection Committee has been established. Among the nineteen members of the committee, seventeen are Tibetans. They are all respected people in various villages in Yadong. They have played a great role in investigating forest conditions and carrying out forest fire prevention work. They also regularly carry out publicity and education on forest protection to the residents. Now, many Tibetan youths are enthusiastically signing up to join the forest protection team that will soon be established.

Tea Trees and Apples

Due to the good climate in Yadong, tea and apple production have great development prospects here. Now, relevant departments are starting to formulate plans for planting tea trees and apple trees. In Renqinggang, Yadong, I visited Wang Zonggeng, a young worker who was transferred here from the Guanxian Tea Experiment Farm in Sichuan to specialize in planting tea trees. He led me to visit the tea garden where more than 400 tea seedlings were cultivated. The tender leaves of the tea seedlings had already grown. He said that there was no tea tree in Tibet in the past, but tea is an indispensable item in the lives of the Tibetan people. According to the current growth of tea seedlings, there is no problem planting tea trees here. After observing the tea seedlings overwintering this year, they can be planted in large quantities next year. If Yadong can produce a large amount of tea in the future, it will not only open up new production avenues for local residents, but also change the situation in Tibet, which has always transported tea from the interior over long distances.

Yadong is also the most suitable place in Tibet for planting apple trees. Due to the lack of good varieties and scientific cultivation methods among the residents here, large-scale production is not yet possible. This year, the Yadong People's Bank has issued loans to residents to expand the planting of apple trees, encouraging people to purchase excellent varieties from other places and expand the area of apple orchards. Local Tibetan people have now begun to cultivate new apple seedlings.

    祖国边疆美丽的城市——亚东
    新华社记者　赵奇
    七月间，我搭上了从日喀则到亚东的汽车，访问了西藏南部的一角——亚东地区。当汽车到达近五千公尺高的喜马拉雅山山口时，在眼前的喜马拉雅山第三峰——琼莫拉热，雪光耀眼，在它脚下的多吉湖，平静如镜，经常有白鹤飞过湖面。在山口的北面，是一望无际的旷原，过去这里人烟很稀，现在不但能看到来往的汽车，还可以看见一队一队的胶轮马车和飘着小彩旗的骡帮，来往在喜马拉雅山脉南北的商旅显然比从前更加方便了。从山口向南走，经过有“世界高城”之称的帕里，地势逐渐降低了两千多公尺，一直下到气候温和的亚东河谷。这天，我一连看到三种自然界的面貌：从草木不生的风化了的山岭到灌木丛生的地带，然后进入树木参天的河谷，它们的气候的差异也是很大的。
    初访亚东
    进入一条翠绿色的狭谷便到了亚东地区，这里的自然环境和居民的房屋和西藏其他地区都不一样。河谷两岸的山坡上，开满了野玫瑰、海棠和许多野花，蜂蝶在花丛间飞舞，村子里的苹果树和桃树上，果实累累。这里由于气候温和，一年可以种植两季作物。现在，这里新垦的农田已经超过了原有的耕地面积。梯田里的青稞已经收割，比西藏其他的一些地区早两个多月。这里的人民银行也已经向河谷的农民发放了两次贷款。
    亚东不是一个房屋建筑集中的城市，在这条河谷里，只有下司马和仁钦岗有像村镇一样的小街道。自从我国和印度在北京签订了中华人民共和国和印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定以后，这里的贸易更加发展了。当我来到下司马的时候，新的城市正在这里形成，新建的邮电大楼和亚东小学校舍就要完工了，接着修建的还有国营贸易公司、人民银行和其他的楼房，不久，这里还将兴建一个水力发电厂，用来满足发展小型工业和照明的需要。
    访亚东林区
    一百多里长的亚东河谷，是一片茂密的林区，这里生长着有名的喜马拉雅松，很多红松和白松的直径长达六十公分到八十公分，有的高达二十多公尺。这里生长的云杉和桦木，也是很好的建筑材料。过去，森林里很少有人到过。江孜到亚东的公路通车以后，森林的富源才第一次用来支援西藏中部的建设，大批的木料从这里运到江孜和日喀则。现在，一条通往林区的公路正在向林区的纵深伸展。西藏的伐木工人也开始在这里成长起来，伐木工人中除了亚东人和帕里人外，还有拉萨人、日喀则人和江孜人，他们过去大都是无法维持生计的农民和牧民。现在亚东地区的藏族人民正在积极地保护国家的这片森林，亚东护林委员会成立起来了，委员会的十九名委员中，有十七个是藏族。他们都是亚东各村里有声望的人士，在调查森林情况和开展森林防火工作中，都起了很大的作用，他们还经常向居民进行保护森林的宣传教育。现在有许多藏族青年正在踊跃报名参加即将成立的护林队。
    茶树和苹果
    由于亚东气候良好，茶树和苹果生产在这里都有很大的发展前途。现在，有关部门正在着手制定种植茶树和苹果树的计划。在亚东的仁钦岗，我访问了一个从四川灌县茶叶试验场调到这里来，专门试种茶树的青年工人王宗庚，他领着我参观了培植着四百多株茶苗的茶园，茶苗的嫩叶已经生长出来。他说，西藏过去没有一株茶树，但茶叶是西藏人民生活中不可缺少的物品。根据现在生长的茶苗来看，在这里种植茶树已经没有问题，只等今年观察茶苗过冬情况以后，明年就可以大量种植了。如果将来亚东能够大量产茶，不仅为当地居民开辟了新的生产道路，还可以改变西藏一向到内地远道运茶叶的情况。
    亚东也是西藏目前最适合种植苹果树的地方，由于这里的居民缺乏良种和科学培植方法，现在还不能大量生产。今年亚东人民银行已经向居民发放了扩植苹果树的贷款，鼓励人民到外地采购优良品种，扩大苹果园面积。当地藏族人民现在已经开始栽培新的苹果树苗了。
