    Kingdom of Yemen
    The Kingdom of Yemen is located in the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula, guarding the exit of the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. It covers an area of approximately 195,000 square kilometers and has a population of nearly five million, mostly Arabs, who adhere to Islam.
    Yemen is a rich place on the Arabian Peninsula, with more rainfall, fertile land, and abundant agricultural products, earning it the title of "Arabian Paradise."
    The people of Yemen are mainly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. The coffee produced in Yemen is famous in the world market. Yemeni craftsmen are known for their exquisite skills, and the jewelry and household items they produce are widely sold in many countries in the East.
    Because Yemen possesses abundant oil resources and occupies an important strategic position, it has always been coveted by imperialists. In Yemen's history, it was twice occupied by Turkey. As early as 1839, Britain forcibly occupied Aden, a territory of Yemen. In 1863 and 1882, Britain successively expanded the territory of Aden and merged some parts of Yemen into Aden, placing the southern region of Yemen under British "protection," calling it the "Protectorate."
    The people of Yemen have constantly launched heroic armed struggles against the colonialists to oppose colonial oppression and defend their sovereignty and independence. It finally freed itself from Turkish oppression after World War I and forced Britain to recognize its independent sovereignty.
    However, Western colonialism's aggression against Yemen did not stop. After World War II, the United States stepped up its expansion and consolidation of its position in the Middle East, expanding its economic influence in Yemen. In 1946, the United States seized Yemen's oil exploration rights with a loan of one million US dollars. British and American imperialists are engaged in fierce struggles for Yemen's oil and market.
    After World War II, colonialists incited two bloody riots in Yemen. In January 1948, Britain, attempting to completely control Yemen, instigated Yemeni traitors to assassinate King Yahya of Yemen. However, this conspiracy was quickly defeated. Three months later, the eldest son of the late king, the current King Ahmad of Yemen, led troops to counterattack and restored the regime. In late March 1955, the imperialists arranged a conspiracy to subvert the Yemeni government, using the then Foreign Minister Emir Abdullah to launch a coup, forcing King Ahmad to abdicate. However, this conspiracy of the imperialists also failed to succeed. Crown Prince Badr of Yemen led tribal troops supporting the king to quell the rebellion and restore order.
    Not only that, in August 1949, Britain used threats and inducements to force Yemen to accept a number of aggressive conditions (such as demanding exclusive rights to exploit Yemen's oil and Yemen's trade); after being rejected, Britain forcibly occupied the Shapor oil-producing area of Yemen. Since the end of 1951, despite repeated protests from the Yemeni government, Britain has begun to extensively build strategic highways, military airfields, and other military facilities in the undefined border area. Britain has also amassed large numbers of troops on the Yemeni border, conducting military exercises; British military aircraft frequently violated Yemeni airspace, bombing Yemeni cities and villages, intimidating and provoking the Yemeni people. Britain also frequently provoked border conflicts between Yemen and Aden, creating incidents in an attempt to achieve its expansionist goals.
    This unbridled aggression by Britain has been resolutely opposed by the Yemeni government and people. On June 10 this year, Yemeni Minister of State and Deputy Foreign Minister Qadi al-Amri issued a statement saying that the so-called Eastern and Western Protectorates of Aden under British rule are part of Yemeni territory, and "the time has come for these lands to be reintegrated into Yemen." The statement also condemned the British army's aggression in Yemen.
    This aggressive behavior of Britain against Yemen has also aroused widespread anger among people all over the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa. The final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference held in April 1955 also noted this issue, and the participating countries unanimously agreed: "The Asian-African Conference supports Yemen's position on the issue of Aden and the southern region of Yemen known as the Protectorate, and calls on the parties concerned to achieve a peaceful resolution of this dispute."
    Yemen is now a member of the United Nations. It joined the Arab League in 1945, and it has consistently pursued a policy of unity and cooperation with Arab countries. In recent years, the United States' policy of piecing together aggressive military blocs and splitting Arab countries in the Middle East has been opposed by Yemen. The Yemeni government has announced that it stands on the neutral side and opposes "participating in military treaties and colonialism."
    The Yemeni government and people actively implement a foreign policy of peace and neutrality. Yemen's relations with Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab countries have become increasingly close. On April 21 this year, following the signing of a military, economic, and cultural cooperation agreement between Egypt and Yemen and a military agreement between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia signed a military treaty. The Yemeni government has repeatedly stated that it will take measures to strengthen unity and cooperation among Arab countries and oppose foreign interference in Arab affairs. Recently, Egypt's righteous action to nationalize the Suez Canal Company to safeguard its sovereignty and independence has received full support from the Yemeni government. The Soviet people and the Yemeni people have long-standing friendship. The Soviet Union and Yemen have long established diplomatic and commercial relations. Not long ago, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yemen, Saif al-Islam Muhammad al-Badr, was invited to visit the Soviet Union, which further promoted the development of friendly relations between Yemen and the Soviet Union.
    Our country and Yemen have friendly relations. During the Asian-African Conference held in April last year, our delegation had friendly contacts with the Yemeni delegation, laying a solid foundation for the development of friendly relations between the two countries. Now that our two countries have officially announced the establishment of diplomatic relations, it is the inevitable result of the two countries' implementation of independent foreign policies of peace and international cooperation.

### 也门王国

    也门王国
    也门王国位于阿拉伯半岛西南角，扼红海通印度洋出口处。面积约十九万五千平方公里，居民近五百万，绝大部分是阿拉伯族，信仰伊斯兰教。
    在阿拉伯半岛上，也门是一个富饶的地方；雨量较多，土地肥沃，农产品丰富，有“阿拉伯乐园”之称。
    也门人民主要从事农业和畜牧业。也门出产的咖啡，驰名世界市场。也门的手工艺者以精湛的技巧著称，他们所制造的首饰和家庭用具广泛行销于东方许多国家。
    由于也门拥有丰富的石油资源，在战略上占有重要地位，因此它一直为帝国主义者所觊觎。在也门的历史上，曾两度被土耳其侵占。远在1839年，英国便强占了也门的领土亚丁，1863年和1882年英国先后扩大亚丁的疆域，又将也门的一些地方合并于亚丁，把也门南部地区置于英国“保护”之下，称为“保护国”。
    也门人民为反对殖民主义压迫、保卫自己的主权和独立，曾不断地对殖民者展开壮烈的武装斗争。它终于在第一次世界大战之后，摆脱了土耳其的压迫，并迫使英国也不得不承认它的独立主权。
    但是，西方殖民主义对也门的侵略并没有停止。第二次世界大战后，美国加紧扩张和巩固它在中东的阵地，扩展了它在也门的经济势力。1946年，美国以一百万美元的贷款攫取了也门的石油开采权。英、美帝国主义者为了争夺也门的石油和市场，进行着剧烈的斗争。
    在第二次世界大战后，殖民主义者在也门煽动了两次流血暴动。1948年1月，英国企图完全控制也门，唆使也门的内奸谋杀了也门国王亚哈雅。可是这个阴谋很快地便遭到失败，三个月后，故王长子、即现在也门国王艾哈迈德率兵反攻，恢复了政权。帝国主义又于1955年3月底布置了一次企图颠复也门政府的阴谋，利用当时的外交大臣埃米尔·阿卜杜拉发动了政变，强迫国王艾哈迈德退位。但是，帝国主义的这次阴谋也没有能够得逞。也门皇太子巴德尔率领了支持国王的部落军队平服了叛乱，恢复了秩序。
    不仅这样，英国在1949年8月用威胁利诱的手段要也门接受其多项侵略条件（如要求对开采也门的石油和也门的贸易有专有权等）；遭拒绝后，英国更以武力强占了也门的沙波尔石油产区。自1951年年底以来，英国不顾也门政府的一再抗议，在未定界地区内开始广泛地修筑战略公路、军用机场和其他一些军事设施。英国还在也门边境集结大批军队，举行军事演习；英国军用飞机经常侵犯也门领空，轰炸也门的城市和乡村，对也门人民进行威吓和挑衅。英国并经常挑起也门和亚丁间的边境冲突，制造事件，企图达到它的扩张目的。
    英国这种肆无忌惮的侵略行为，遭到了也门政府和人民的坚决反对。今年六月十日，也门国务大臣兼外交副大臣卡迪·艾马里发表声明说，英国统治下的所谓亚丁东部和西部保护地是也门领土的一部分，“这些土地重新归并于也门的时机已经到来了”。声明并谴责英国军队在也门进行侵略。
    英国对也门的这种侵略行为，也引起了全世界人民、特别是亚非各国人民的普遍愤怒。1955年4月举行的亚非会议的最后公报中，也曾注意到这个问题，与会各国一致同意：“亚非会议支持也门在亚丁和被称为保护国的也门南部地区问题上的立场，并要求有关方面获致这一争端的和平解决。”
    也门现在是联合国的会员国。它于1945年加入阿拉伯联盟，它一贯实行和阿拉伯各国团结合作的政策。近年来，美国在中东采取的拼凑侵略性军事集团和分裂阿拉伯国家的政策遭到了也门的反对。也门政府宣布站在中立方面，反对“参加军事条约和殖民主义。”
    也门政府和人民积极执行和平中立的外交政策。也门同埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯等阿拉伯国家之间的关系已日益密切。今年四月二十一日，继埃及同也门签订军事、经济及文化合作协定和也门同沙特阿拉伯签订军事协定后，也门、埃及和沙特阿拉伯三国签订了一项军事条约。也门政府一再表示要采取加强阿拉伯国家间团结合作的措施，反对外国干涉阿拉伯国家的事务。最近，埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有这一维护自己主权和独立的正义行动，得到了也门政府的全力支持。苏联人民和也门人民之间本来有着长期的友谊。苏联和也门早已建立了外交和商业关系。不久以前，也门皇太子、副首相兼外交大臣塞弗·伊斯兰·穆罕默德·巴德尔应邀到苏联进行了访问，更促进了也门和苏联之间的友好关系的更加发展。
    我国和也门有着友好的关系。在去年四月间举行的亚非会议期间，我国代表团同也门代表团曾进行了友好的接触，为两国友好关系的发展奠定了巩固的基础。现在我们两国正式宣布建立外交关系，是两国执行独立的和平和国际合作的外交政策的必然结果。（周修庆）
