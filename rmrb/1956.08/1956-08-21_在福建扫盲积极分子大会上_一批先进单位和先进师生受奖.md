Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 19th: At the Fujian Province Literacy Elimination Activists Representative Conference, which closed on the 18th, fifty-one advanced literacy units and four hundred and fifty-one outstanding literacy workers, literacy teachers, and students were rewarded.

Among the advanced literacy units that were rewarded was the Dongyu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Longxi County. In leading this work, the unit managed to balance literacy and production. 78% of illiterate and semi-literate people in the district persisted in year-round spare-time cultural learning. During the spring plowing this year, the district eliminated illiteracy for 1,489 people. The average yield of early rice in the district reached 524 jin per mu, making it one of the high-yield areas for early rice in the county.

Among the literacy activists who were rewarded was Ji Guangquan, an excellent private school teacher from Pucheng County. Every night, he had to walk five li along a desolate mountain path, where tigers often roamed, to teach in a neighboring village. Once, a dog accompanying him was dragged away by a tiger, but he still mustered the courage to go to the private school to teach. From the winter of 1952 to the present, he has single-handedly eliminated illiteracy for seventy-four people.

Liu Jindi, the secretary of the Xipi Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Fu'an County, studied diligently, practiced hard, and improved his learning methods. In seven months, he went from being illiterate to being able to read and write. Wang Liyan, a young farmer who was illiterate four years ago but wrote a novel of 170,000 words this year, was also rewarded.

    受到奖励的扫盲先进单位，有中共龙溪县东屿区委会，这个单位在领导这一工作中做到了扫盲和生产兼顾，全区有78％的文盲半文盲坚持常年业余文化学习，区内在今年春耕中就扫除了一千四百八十九名文盲。这个区今年早稻产量平均每亩达五百二十四斤，是该县早稻丰产区之一。
    受到奖励的扫盲积极分子有浦城县优秀民校教师季光泉，他每天晚上要走五里经常有老虎出没的荒山小道到邻村去教学。有一次和他做伴的一只狗走在前面被老虎拖去了，但他仍然鼓起勇气走到民校上课。从1952年冬天到现在，他一个人就扫除了七十四个文盲。
    中共福安县溪邳乡支部书记刘金俤，勤学苦练，改进学习方法，在七个月中从文盲状态作到了会读会写。四年前还是个文盲，今年写出一部十七万字小说的青年农民王礼燕，也受到奖励。
