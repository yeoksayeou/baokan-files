Carry Forward National Tradition
Prosper Musical Art

The first National Music Week, which lasted for nearly four weeks in the capital, has concluded successfully after a large-scale and relatively comprehensive review of our country's music composition and performance.

This Music Week featured a relatively concentrated performance of various musical works with various themes, forms, and styles, including classical, ethnic, and folk music, music from the "May Fourth" era, and music from after the founding of New China. It demonstrated the richness of our national and folk music heritage and also showed the changes and new developments in our country's musical art over the past seven years. Such a grand and widely representative music event is unprecedented in our country. This was a Music Week of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

From the performances of Music Week, we can see that our country's musical creation has been further integrated with the people's lives, struggles, and thoughts, and with the people's construction cause. At the same time, our music workers have made valuable efforts in exploring, organizing, and studying our national, folk, and classical music heritage. In the performance programs of Music Week, folk songs, classical music pieces, and national instrumental music accounted for a large proportion. Moreover, there have been improvements in the quality of organization, processing, and adaptation, in the level of singing and playing, and in the organization and creation of lyrics. Musical works that use European musical forms, techniques, and instruments to express the lives of modern Chinese people have also made relatively significant progress in the pursuit of national style.

Music Week greatly encouraged the creative enthusiasm of veteran composers, performers, and young composers and performers; organized musical exchanges among eighteen ethnic groups, promoted the development of music of various ethnic groups, and demonstrated the unprecedented unity of our country's music circles. This unity is not only reflected in the wide representation of the members participating in Music Week, but also particularly reflected in the sincere and frank discussions on performance programs and various urgent issues in current music work during Music Week. These discussions are beneficial to promoting the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in our country's musical art, to improving the level of musical artistic thought, and to enhancing the unity of the music circles.

Naturally, from the performance programs and performances of Music Week, we can also see many shortcomings and problems. The most important of these are: our country's musical work policy is not clear enough, there is a phenomenon of neglecting national tradition and national heritage, the relevant departments lack specific assistance to the creative practice of music workers, the work of musical theoretical criticism is weak, and there is a lack of comprehensive planning and specific measures for the development of the music industry. These shortcomings and problems should be overcome and resolved.

Our country is a country with a long musical tradition. We have a rich national and folk music heritage. This heritage is an important part of the national culture accumulated by the motherland over thousands of years, and it has a close and inseparable connection with the spiritual life of our people. Many of these heritages have already been accepted by us, but there are still many rich treasures waiting for us to explore and organize. We should pay special attention to our national musical tradition, should more deeply and systematically explore the national and folk music heritage, and should strengthen the organization and research of the heritage. We should strive to familiarize ourselves with it, master it, and carry it forward. Our country's new people's music can only have better development and prosperity on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the national tradition and critically accepting foreign music as nourishment and reference.

Many excellent musical works since the "May Fourth" Movement are an important part of our national musical heritage and must be inherited. Many excellent works from various historical periods and various representative writers since the "May Fourth" period have left a very deep impression on the masses of the people. They not only had a great social role at the time, but can still inspire the people to continue to move forward today and should continue to be sung.

Further introducing, learning, and mastering the advanced theories and excellent techniques of foreign music is of great help to meeting the needs of our people's musical artistic life in many ways and promoting the development of our country's music industry, and this aspect of work should also be strengthened. However, when using foreign musical forms, techniques, and instruments to express the lives of the Chinese people, we should strive to make it have our own national style, and we should strive to popularize it, and we should not regard foreign musical theories and techniques as dogma, and mechanically apply it to our musical creation, and apply it to the organization and research of national and folk music. Chinese music must have its own national form and national style.

We should further vigorously carry out music creation and performance activities. Musicians should go deep into life, deep into the folk, and better and more create and perform musical works of various themes, forms, and styles that reflect the lives and struggles of our people. We should encourage the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in musical creation and performance, and allow musicians to have full freedom to choose the themes and topics they are familiar with and understand, and choose the forms of expression they like and are good at, so as to enrich the content of musical creation and enable various genres and styles of musical works and performances to be fully developed. Our music workers should give greater care and more frequent guidance to the musical activities of the masses, so as to make our country's mass music movement more vigorously developed.

The development of theoretical criticism is of utmost importance to the prosperity of the music industry. We should encourage the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in musical theoretical criticism to promote the construction of our country's musical theory, especially the construction of national musical theory.

In order to better inherit and carry forward our national musical tradition and further develop the people's music industry, there should be a comprehensive plan for the development of our country's music industry. We should systematically consolidate or develop national and folk music singing and playing groups, national and folk music research institutions, various choirs and orchestras in a planned and step-by-step manner; systematically improve music education, cultivate more musical talents; and take effective measures to strengthen music publishing, instrument manufacturing, and recording work.

The achievements of the first National Music Week fill us with confidence in the healthy development of our country's musical art. May the national music workers work together to push our country's people's musical art to a new era of prosperity.

### 发扬民族传统  繁荣音乐艺术

    发扬民族传统
    繁荣音乐艺术
    在首都举行了将近四个星期的第一届全国音乐周，对我国的音乐创作、表演作了一次规模巨大的比较全面的检阅，现在圆满地闭幕了。
    这次音乐周，比较集中地会演了我国古典的、各民族的、“五四”以来的和新中国成立以后的各种题材、各种形式和风格的音乐作品，显示了我国民族和民间音乐遗产的丰富，也显示了七年来我国音乐艺术的变化和新的发展。这样规模宏大和具有广泛代表性的音乐会演，在我国是空前的。这是一个“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的音乐周。
    从音乐周的演出中，可以看出我国音乐创作同人民的生活、斗争和思想感情，同人民的建设事业，都有了进一步的结合；同时我们的音乐工作者，对于我国民族、民间和古典音乐遗产的发掘、整理和研究，作了可贵的努力。在音乐周的演出节目中，民歌、古典乐曲和民族器乐，占了很大的比重；并且在整理、加工和改编的质量上，在演唱和演奏的水平上，在歌词的整理和创作水平上，都有提高。运用欧洲的音乐形式、技巧和乐器来表现现代中国人民生活的音乐作品，在追求民族风格上，也有了比较显著的进步。
    音乐周大大鼓舞了老作曲家、表演家和青年作曲家、表演家的创作热情；组织了十八个民族的音乐交流，推动了各民族音乐的发展，表现了我国音乐界的空前大团结。这种团结，不单表现在参加音乐周的成员的广泛的代表性上面，还特别表现在举行音乐周期间大家对于演出节目和当前音乐工作中各种迫切问题的诚恳坦率的讨论上面。这种讨论，对于促进我国音乐艺术的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，对于提高音乐艺术思想的水平，对于增强音乐界的团结，都是有益的。
    自然，从音乐周的演出节目和表演中，也可以看出不少缺点和问题。其中最重要的是：我国音乐工作的方针还不够明确，存在着轻视民族传统和民族遗产的现象，有关部门对音乐工作者的创作实践缺乏具体的帮助，音乐理论批评工作薄弱，对于音乐事业的发展缺乏全面的规划和具体的措施。对于这些缺点和问题，应当加以克服和解决。
    我国是一个有悠久音乐传统的国家，我们有丰富的民族和民间的音乐遗产，这些遗产是祖国千百年来积累起来的民族文化的重要组成部分，它和我国人民的精神生活有着密切不可分离的联系。这些遗产中有许多已经被我们接受下来，但是还有许多丰富的宝藏等待着我们去发掘和整理。我们应该特别重视我们民族的音乐传统，应当更加深入地和系统地发掘民族和民间的音乐遗产，并且加强对遗产的整理研究工作。应当努力去熟悉它，掌握它，发扬它。我国新的人民音乐，只有在继承和发扬民族传统的基础上，并且批判地接受外国的音乐作为养料和借鉴，才能有更好的发展和繁荣。
    “五四”运动以来的许多优秀的音乐作品，是我们民族音乐遗产的重要部分，必须加以继承。“五四”以来各个历史时期，各个代表作家的许多优秀作品，在人民群众中留下非常深刻的印象，它们不仅在当时有很大的社会作用，就是在今天也仍然能够鼓舞人民继续前进，应当继续加以传唱。
    进一步地介绍、学习和掌握外国音乐的先进理论和优良的技巧，对于多方面地满足我国人民对音乐艺术生活的需要，促进我国音乐事业的发展，是有很大帮助的，应当同样加强这方面的工作。但是，在运用外来的音乐形式、技巧和乐器来表现中国人民的生活的时候，应当努力使它具有我们自己的民族风格，并且要力求群众化，而不应当把外国的音乐理论和技巧当做教条，生吞活剥地运用到我们的音乐创作上来，运用到对民族和民间音乐的整理研究工作上来。中国的音乐必须有自己的民族形式和民族风格。
    应当进一步大力开展音乐的创作和演出活动。音乐家们应当深入生活，深入民间，更好地和更多地创作和演出反映我国人民生活和斗争的各种题材、各种形式和风格的音乐作品。应当鼓励音乐创作和表演上的“百花齐放”，允许音乐家有充分的自由选择他所熟悉的、了解的题材和主题，选择他所喜爱的、擅长的表现形式，使音乐创作的内容更加丰富，使各种不同体裁、不同风格的音乐作品和表演，都能够得到充分的发展。我们的音乐工作者，应当对群众的音乐活动给以更大的关怀和更多的经常的指导，使我国的群众音乐运动更加蓬勃地开展起来。
    理论批评工作的开展，对于音乐事业的繁荣有极重要的意义。应当鼓励音乐理论批评工作上的“百家争鸣”，以促进我国音乐理论的建设工作，特别是民族音乐理论的建设工作。
    为了更好地继承和发扬我国民族音乐传统，进一步发展人民音乐事业，对于我国音乐事业的发展应当有一个全面的规划。应当有计划有步骤地巩固或发展民族和民间音乐的演唱和演奏团体、民族和民间音乐的研究机构、各种合唱团和管弦乐团；系统地改进音乐教育，更多地培养音乐人才；并且采取有效措施，加强音乐出版、乐器制造和灌制唱片的工作。
    第一届全国音乐周的成果，使我们对我国音乐艺术的健全发展充满信心。愿全国音乐工作者共同努力，把我国人民音乐艺术推向一个繁荣的新时代。
