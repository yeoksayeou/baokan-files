A Folk Artist's Appeal
Qiao Xiyuan

I am a storytelling artist from Ji'an County, Jilin Province. I want to talk about the troubles and demands of us artists.

In the past, although it was stipulated that the county Bureau of Culture and Education should lead the folk professional artists, in fact, many county Bureaus of Culture and Education only did one thing: issue a letter of introduction to the artists when they went to other places to perform. The county Bureaus of Culture and Education, cultural centers and stations, did not mobilize professional artists or organize them to study. Artists did not get the opportunity to study, and their political and ideological awareness and artistic level could not be improved. Some county Bureaus of Culture and Education, cultural centers and stations, gave all the performance materials compiled and printed by the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Workers and the Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions to amateur theater troupes in towns and villages, but not to professional folk artists.

Because of the lack of organizational leadership and new performance materials, when professional folk artists went to various places to perform, some places banned performances, and some places left them alone. Once, a professional theater troupe went to Diaoyutai Village, Fifth District, Ji'an County, to perform a program including "Huang's Daughter Travels to the Underworld." The village cadres quickly drove the troupe away. However, no one cared about how to help the troupe improve its performance content.

Some artists said: "You always tell us to change the old stuff we sing, but no one guides us on how to change it. We can't get new stuff either. We don't even get to study. Let's just take the old path of selling songs for a living. We'll sing where we're allowed to sing; we'll leave where we're not allowed to sing; if we're not allowed to sing anywhere, we'll figure something out. If the day comes we're not needed, then that's it!"

This is a serious problem. Our country has launched socialist competitions on various fronts, making rapid progress in building a happy socialist society. But many of our professional artists have fallen behind and have not been able to serve socialist construction well. Therefore, I request that the cultural and educational departments of the Party and the government strengthen their leadership over folk professional artists, organize us to study, and improve our ideological awareness. I request that writers in the literary and art circles create or adapt more new songbooks to replace the old, poisonous ones. We professional folk artists all want to make progress. Who doesn't want to contribute to building a happy socialist society?

    一个民间艺人的呼声
    乔喜原
    我是吉林省辑安县的一个书曲艺人。我要讲一点我们艺人的苦恼和要求。
    过去，虽然曾经规定由县文教科领导民间职业艺人，但事实上许多县的文教科只做了一件事，就是艺人要到别的地方演出的时候，给他们开一封介绍信。县文教科，文化馆、站，没有把职业艺人发动起来，组织艺人学习。艺人得不到学习的机会，政治思想觉悟和艺术水平不能提高。有的县文教科，文化馆、站，把省文学艺术工作者联合会和省文化局、省工会编印的演唱材料全都发给城镇、乡村的业余剧团，不发给民间职业艺人。
    民间职业艺人由于缺少组织领导和新的演唱材料，到各地演唱的时候，有的地方就禁演，有的地方就放任不管。曾经有一个职业剧团到辑安县五区吊鱼台村演唱，演唱的节目中有“黄氏女游阴”。村干部赶快把这个剧团撵走了。但是，怎样帮助这个剧团改进演唱内容，却无人过问。
    有的艺人说：“咱们唱的旧玩艺，光说叫咱们改，也没有人指导咱们怎样改。新的玩艺，咱们也得不着。学习也捞不着学习。咱们就来个走老道卖唱挣钱吃饭吧，那场让唱咱就唱；那场不让唱咱就走；都不让唱再核计，那天不要就拉倒！”
    这是个严重的问题。我们的国家在各个不同的战线上都掀起了社会主义竞赛，突飞猛进地建设幸福的社会主义社会。但我们很多职业艺人，却落在后头，未能很好为社会主义建设服务。因此，我要求党和政府的文教机关加强对于民间职业艺人的领导，组织我们学习，提高思想觉悟。要求文艺界的作家们多创作或改编一些新的唱本，以代替旧的有毒素的唱本。我们民间职业艺人都是要求进步的，谁不希望为建设幸福的社会主义社会贡献自己的力量呢？
