Title: Not a New Experience

I arrived at Maozhuang Township in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, not long after the joint village agricultural cooperative had distributed wheat.

It is said that the more than two thousand mu of wheat in the joint village agricultural production cooperative grew as high as a person's chest. Although when I went, the late seedlings in the wheat stubble fields had already emerged, and I didn't see the wheat growing in the fields, I could still perceive a sense of triumph from the tense labor of the cooperative members in cultivating, removing insects, and pruning cotton. I asked the cooperative cadres how the wheat harvest was this year and how the distribution went. They didn't answer me with the statistic that more than 90% of the cooperative members had increased their income compared to the same season last year, nor did they compare this year's wheat yield of 350 jin per mu with last year's 270 jin per mu. Instead, they told me a few very interesting stories. *

Sun Luoyin, an old man from the Twenty-Eighth Production Team, had twelve people in his family, with as many as nine full and half-laborers working in the fields. Since his family joined the agricultural production cooperative in 1953, their lives had become more prosperous year by year. People all said that his family was truly "prosperous in both people and wealth." As the head of the family, Sun Luoyin was already very satisfied with this situation. At the same time, because he had a large group of children and grandchildren, and they were all outstanding workers in the cooperative, he felt that he could rest easy. He said to his wife, "We are destined to have good fortune in our later years and should enjoy a few years of happiness." He threw down his hoe and even relinquished the responsibility of managing the household to his son.

Since the elementary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative last winter, the cooperative required his family to contribute more than 500 yuan in share funds based on six full laborers and three half-laborers. This spring, the cooperative again mobilized him to invest. This disturbed the old man. Based on his experience in the elementary cooperative, Sun Luoyin knew that the advanced cooperative must be better than the elementary cooperative. But he was uneasy about paying money before receiving money. Therefore, the old man quickly took back the responsibility of managing the household, furrowed his brow, and economized on food and expenses, fearing that he would not be able to make ends meet and would incur debts.

In early June, the cooperative announced the preliminary wheat distribution plan. He did not expect that he would be allocated 2,500 jin of wheat in his name, an increase of 66% compared to last year. He smiled. But he was still worried that the cooperative would deduct this fee and that charge. He said, "This is still just on paper, it's not guaranteed." It wasn't until the afternoon of June 19th, when the cooperative members delivered the wheat to his house, that the stone weighing on his heart was lifted. In the evening, he called the whole family together and said, "I originally wanted to retire and not work anymore. It seems that socialism depends on labor. Let's do this: I'll take care of the six fen of vegetable garden for our own use, and you can free up your hands and feet to work more in the cooperative." This sixty-five-year-old man not only managed the private plot, but also joined the ranks of competitors in the fields the next day. He wanted to pass on his many years of production experience to the younger generation.

According to the cooperative cadres, Sun Luoyin's performance roughly represents the sentiments of about a hundred cooperative member households in the entire cooperative of more than 800 households. *

Zhang Luokuan, known as a production expert, is an honest man who doesn't like to talk much. One evening after the wheat harvest, the team headquarters of the Twenty-Ninth Team was crowded with people discussing matters. He slowly walked into the room and said to the captain in a reproachful tone, "The corn in the south of the village has had quite a few seedlings pulled out by the children, and no one is taking care of it. Wasting the cooperative's crops affects everyone. Everyone should restrain their own children." Everyone was surprised and delighted to hear the person who didn't like to speak say something. Some cooperative members who liked to joke said, "What's going on, has Luokuan been possessed!"

Originally, Zhang Luokuan was very concerned about the affairs of the cooperative. But since the elementary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, he had become somewhat passive. The eight rubber-wheeled carts that the cooperative spent more than 10,000 yuan to buy were left unused; the club spent more than 200 yuan to buy a "running donkey" and costume supplies; a movie cost 60 yuan, and regardless of whether people watched it or not, it was shown once every half a month. He was not satisfied with these things. Although the cooperative cadres later made self-criticisms at the cooperative members' meeting, he was still not very convinced. He stood at the head of the wheat field and said to the wheat, "Don't think you're growing strong, it might be discounted by 70% or 80% in the end." He adopted a "wait and see" attitude towards the advanced cooperative. This wheat distribution completely exceeded his expectations. He said to his wife, "The granary is filled with about eight hundred jin of wheat, this is the first time I've seen this since I can remember." It was this incident that awakened his original enthusiasm for the cooperative. Recently, he not only automatically put forward rationalization proposals, but also led a group of cooperative members to brave the rain to save more than 5,000 adobe bricks that the team was preparing to use to build livestock sheds. *

After the wheat distribution, a new atmosphere immediately appeared in the production of Maozhuang Township. Sun Sanyuan, the director of the supervisory committee of the cooperative and the deputy secretary of the branch, said to me, "In the end, we have gained a very important experience in the past six months: to make the cooperative members love socialism, we must increase production and guarantee that the cooperative members receive more grain." He glanced at me to see my reaction, and then said, "This experience is not new, is it! But it was not easy for us to gain this experience."

    并不新鲜的经验
    蔚蓝
    我到河北藁城县毛庄乡，正是那里的联村农业合作社分配小麦以后不多久。
    联村农业生产合作社的两千多亩小麦，据说长的齐了胸脯。虽然我去的时候麦茬地里的晚苗已经出土，没有看见那长在地里的小麦，但还是可以从社员们在中耕、除虫和进行棉花整枝的紧张劳动里，觉察到一种打了胜仗以后的情绪。我问社干部，今年小麦收成怎样？分配的结果如何？他们没有用90％以上的社员比去年同季增加收入的数字，也没有把今年小麦亩产三百五十斤与去年亩产二百七十斤作一个对比来回答我，却告诉了我几个很有意思的故事。＊
    第二十八生产队的老头孙洛印，家里有十二口人，光下地干活的整劳动力和半劳动力就有九个。他家从1953年参加农业生产合作社以来，日子过得一年比一年红火。人们都说他家真是“人财两旺”。作为家长的孙洛印对这样的光景已经很满足了；同时，因为儿孙一大群，在合作社里又都是出色的干将，觉得自己可以歇心了。他对老伴说：“咱们命里有后运，该享几年福了。”他把锄头扔下，连管家的事也撒手推给儿子了。
    自从去年冬天初级社转成高级社，社里让他家按六个整劳力和三个半劳力拿出了股份基金五百多元；今年春天，社里又动员他投资。这下子可把老头子的心打乱了。凭在初级社的经验，孙洛印知道高级社一定比初级社错不了。可是没进钱，先出钱，他不放心。于是，老头子连忙把当家的差事又揽在手里，皱起眉头，省吃俭用，怕的是进不敷出，落下窟窿。
    六月初，社里公布了小麦预分方案，他没有料想到自己名下应分两千五百斤麦子，比去年增加了66％。他脸上有了笑容。可是他还在担心社里再扣这个金那个费，他说：“这还是纸上的东西哩，不保险。”等到六月十九日下午，社员们把麦子送到他家，压在他心上的石头才落了地。晚上，他把全家人叫在一起，说：“我本来想歇老不干活了；看来，社会主义是出在劳动上。这样吧：把自留的那六分菜园归我种吧，腾出你们的脚手在社里多干活。”这位六十五岁的老人，不仅管了自留地，而且第二天又参加到竞赛的人群中下地了。他要把多年的生产经验传给年轻的一代。
    据社干部们说，全社八百多户，孙洛印的表现大约可以代表百来户社员的情绪。＊
    号称生产能手的张洛宽，是个顶不爱讲话的老实人。麦收后的一天晚上，二十九队的队部里挤满了正在讨论事情的人。他慢腾腾地走进屋子，用责备的口气向队长说：“村南那块玉米，让孩子们拔去了好些棵苗子，也没人管。糟塌了社里的庄稼，大家都有份。谁也应该管住自家的孩子。”大伙见不爱吭声的人说了话，又惊又喜。有些爱开玩笑的社员说：“怎么搞的，洛宽换了魂啦！”
    本来，张洛宽对社里的事情是很关心的。可是自从初级社转成高级社以后，他变得有点消极了。社里花一万多元买的八辆胶轮大车扔着不用；俱乐部里花二百来元买了“跑驴”和化装用品；一场电影花六十元，不管人们看不看，每逢半月放映一回。这些事，他都不满意。虽然后来社干部们在社员大会上作了检讨，他还是不大信服。他站在麦田头上对着麦子说过：“别看你长的强，说不定七折八扣就完了。”他对高级社抱着“看看再说”的态度。这次小麦分配，完全出乎他的意料，他对老婆说：“囤里盛上八百来斤麦子，还是我记事以来头一回。”就是这件事，唤起了他本来就有的爱社热情。他近来不只自动地提出合理化建议，而且带动一伙社员冒雨救护了队里准备盖牲口棚用的五千多块土坯。＊
    麦子分配以后，毛庄乡的生产立即出现了新气象。合作社监察委员会主任、支部副书记孙三元跟我说：“说来说去，这半年我们得了一条顶重要的经验：要让社员热爱社会主义，就得多多增产，就得保证社员多分粮食。”他瞅了瞅我，看我有什么反应，接着又说：“这经验不新鲜了吧！可是我们得到这条经验，并不是很容易的。”
