    Reversing the Trend of Neglecting Afforestation Quality
    Ministry of Forestry Decides to Launch National Seedling Inspection

    Xinhua News Agency, August 5th – The Ministry of Forestry recently issued a notice deciding to launch a comprehensive seedling inspection across the country earlier this year in order to identify experiences in improving afforestation quality and reverse the past phenomenon of neglecting quality in afforestation.

    This work requires focusing on inspecting afforestation quality, verifying the survival rate, area, density, and seedling growth, analyzing the reasons, summarizing experiences and lessons, and rewarding and commending advanced units and individuals, so that this inspection becomes the starting point for improving greening work. The scope of the inspection mainly covers forests newly planted this spring, and necessary supplementary inspections will also be conducted on forests planted in the past few years.

    Currently, forestry departments in various regions have formulated seedling inspection plans. Under the leadership of local Party and government leaders, they have invited the Communist Youth League Committee and supervisory departments to participate in forming working groups to conduct seedling inspection work. Provinces such as Shandong, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangxi are all preparing to start comprehensive seedling inspections around August, lasting for more than a month.

    In addition, the Tianshui Special Zone in Gansu has also selected various typical examples representing high-altitude cold and humid areas, hilly gully areas, and river valley areas in Wushan and Chengxian, according to natural conditions, to conduct seedling inspections in order to better improve technology and increase the survival rate in future afforestation. Zhangwu County in Liaoning Province mobilized township and commune cadres to conduct a general survey, proposing the method of "communes inspect what they plant, villages inspect what they plant," which has greatly sped up the seedling inspection work.

    It is expected that the national seedling inspection work will be completed around mid-September.

    扭转不重视造林质量的偏向
    林业部决定在全国开展幼林检查工作
    新华社5日讯　林业部最近发出通知，决定今年提前在全国各地开展一个全面的幼林检查工作，以便找出提高造林质量的经验，扭转过去造林不重视质量的现象。
    这项工作要求以检查造林质量为中心，核实造林成活率、面积、密度和幼林生长情况，分析原因，总结经验教训，奖励表扬先进的单位和个人，使这次检查成为改进绿化工作的起点。检查的范围主要是今年春天新造的林，过去几年造的林也进行必要的补查。
    现在，各地林业部门已制定幼林检查计划，在当地党政领导下，邀请青年团委和监察部门参加，组成工作组，进行幼林检查工作。山东、陕西、黑龙江、湖南、四川、广西等省都准备在八月左右开始，进行为期一个多月的全面幼林检查。
    此外，甘肃天水专区，在武山和成县还按照自然条件选定了代表高寒潮湿地区、丘陵沟壑区、河谷地区的各种典型，进行幼林检查，以便在今后造林中更好地改进技术，提高成活率。辽宁省彰武县发动乡、社干部进行普查，提出“社造社检查、村造村检查”的办法，使幼林检查工作进行很快。
    预计九月中旬左右，全国幼林检查工作将全部完成。
