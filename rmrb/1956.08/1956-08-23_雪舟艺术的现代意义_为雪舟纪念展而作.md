    The Modern Significance of Sesshū's Art
    ——Written for the Sesshū Memorial Exhibition
    Yamaguchi Hoshun, Head of the Japanese Sesshū 450th Anniversary Visiting Delegation to China
    Last year, the World Peace Council held in Vienna decided to commemorate ten world cultural figures this year, including Sesshū Tōyō, the great Japanese painter of the 15th century. This year marks the 450th anniversary of his death, and Japan held a grand Sesshū memorial exhibition. China will also solemnly hold a Sesshū memorial meeting and exhibition. We sincerely express our deep gratitude to the Chinese people for their kindness.
      Japanese culture has been influenced by Chinese culture in many ways since ancient times, especially in the field of fine arts, where it has developed by learning from China. This is similar to how modern European countries' fine arts are based on Greek art and have developed into unique arts of various nations. Greek art ended in ancient times, while Chinese art has continued for thousands of years and is still creating brilliant achievements. Japanese painting was based on ancient Chinese painting. Before Sesshū, the style of Yamato-e (Japanese painting) had already been completed, but it declined in the 15th century, after Sesshū appeared. At that time, Chinese painting (Song and Yuan paintings) was introduced to Japan again, giving Japanese painting a strong influence. In particular, landscape painting, with its profound natural interest and ink painting techniques, was absorbed as a new form of art. Zen monks in Japan learned this ink painting, and great masters such as Tenshō Shūbun appeared. Sesshū Tōyō was a disciple of Shūbun. With his extraordinary talent and experience, he established a true landscape painting style in Japan, laying the foundation for its future development.
    Sesshū not only learned from the works of Song and Yuan masters such as Ma Yuan, Xia Gui, and Liang Kai, but also humbly sought guidance from Ming Dynasty painters of his time. Therefore, he came to China in 1468. The four "Four Seasons Landscape Paintings" he painted at that time, signed "Japanese Zen Buddhist Tōyō," show that he was influenced by the Ming Dynasty court paintings. However, the greatest benefit Sesshū received as an artist in China was that he personally toured the mountains and rivers of China. After all, for a painter, the most fundamental and important thing is to observe nature with his own eyes and establish his own view of nature. Because of this, Sesshū had a deeper view of nature and expression techniques than Ming Dynasty painters who also inherited the traditions of the Song and Yuan painting academies, such as Li Zai, whom Sesshū himself admired.
    Some may ask: Does this mean that Sesshū was entirely a Chinese painter? My answer to this question is: He is similar to Dürer of Germany, who was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, and Poussin, the French master who studied painting during the Renaissance in Italy and laid the foundation for French painting. Sesshū did develop his creation based on Chinese Song and Yuan paintings, but within this style, he created a unique style. Let us use examples to illustrate this.
    We can compare the "Imitation of Xia Gui Landscape" and the "Winter Landscape" of "Autumn and Winter Landscapes," which are exhibited in the exhibition with photographs of the same size as the original. The contents of these two paintings are extremely similar, but the latter, that is, Sesshū's own creation, is more solid in content than the former. The configuration of rocks and rocks and the use of perspective are very reasonable. In particular, the bold painting method of vertically cutting the central part of the picture with a rock wall cannot be seen in Xia Gui's paintings, and it also contradicts the real scenery, but as a painting, it is real. It exaggerates and strongly expresses the unchanging posture of nature, which cannot be seen from the outside of nature alone. This is an important key to understanding Sesshū's paintings. This artistic attitude transcends the limitations of time and national boundaries and leads to modern world art. I think the reality of Sesshū's art, which is both old and new, lies here.
    Through this exhibition, everyone can see that Sesshū not only excelled in landscape painting, but also painted flowers, birds, and figures. In particular, the portrait of "益田兼尧" (Masuda Kanetaka), a feudal lord in Japan, shows that Sesshū was also familiar with the techniques of Yamato-e. Through all of Sesshū's works, I think everyone will see the subtle differences between Sesshū's paintings and Chinese paintings that are difficult to explain in words, and this difference is based on the differences in the climate of the mainland and the island country.
    What we modern painters should learn from Sesshū's art is not his painting themes, the shapes of mountains and rocks, trees, etc., the lines, painting methods, and other superficial things. Even a genius like Sesshū could not go beyond the scope of the style of the times, and there are also Sesshū's historical limitations here. If we modern people only imitate these things, I believe it is meaningless to modern painting.
    What we should learn from Sesshū is his vigorous will and strong spirit to oppose the Zhou Wen-style painting style, which at that time was sticking to the form of Chinese painting, and to create an innovative art, and not only to describe and reproduce natural landscapes on the surface, but, as mentioned above, to find the inherent things that constitute the beauty of nature, and to express them with unique lines and paintings, that free attitude of the artist.
      Japanese painting, on the basis of Sesshū's foundation in the 15th century, moved forward. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the school of painters who simply imitated Sesshū in form declined, and was replaced by great painters with truly Japanese characteristics who opposed this kind of imitation, such as Sōtatsu and Kōrin, and Ukiyo-e prints of common art also appeared. Ukiyo-e prints were introduced to Europe and later became the leader of the innovation of color in Western European Impressionism. In modern times, Japanese painting, which has inherited the traditions of these various historical factors, that is, painting equivalent to Chinese national painting, has undergone great development and changes in the past eighty years, along with oil painting learned from the West. Especially in the past ten years after the war, Japanese painting has been creating new styles. In short, whether before or after Sesshū, we have other innovative and excellent artistic heritages in various eras that are the same as Sesshū's works. This is exactly the same as the situation in China. Taking the opportunity of holding the Sesshū Memorial Exhibition as a start, gradually introducing these situations to China, and China also introducing the situation of the art world to Japan, I think this will be of great benefit to the development of art in both countries, and at the same time, it will be of great benefit to deepening the understanding and friendly relations between the people of the two countries. If this can be the case, I think the significance of holding this Sesshū Memorial Exhibition will be more profound and extensive.

    雪舟艺术的现代意义
    ——为雪舟纪念展而作
    日本雪舟450年纪念会访华代表团团长  山口蓬春
    去年在维也纳召开的世界和平理事会决定在今年纪念十位世界文化名人，日本十五世纪的伟大画家雪舟等杨也是其中之一。今年是他逝世四百五十周年，日本举行了盛大的雪舟纪念展览会，中国也将隆重地举行雪舟的纪念会和展览会。我们对中国人民的这种盛情由衷地致以深深的谢意。
      日本文化自古就多方面地受有中国文化的影响，特别在美术方面更是以中国为师而发展下来的。这点正和现代欧洲各国的美术以希腊美术为基础，发展成为各个民族特有的艺术的情况相同。希腊美术在古代就终结了，而中国美术却延续数千年，直到现在也还在创造着辉煌的业迹。日本绘画以古代中国画为基础，在雪舟以前，大和绘（日本画）的样式既已完成了，但在十五世纪，即雪舟出现之后，却衰退了。当时，中国画（宋元画）又被介绍到日本，给了日本绘画强烈的影响。特别是山水画，以其深邃的自然情趣和水墨表现技巧，被作为一种新的美术吸收过来了。日本禅宗的画僧们学习了这种水墨画，出现了天章周文这样的大家。雪舟等杨是周文的弟子，他以其颖异的资质和体验，在日本确立了真正的山水画形式，为其以后的发展奠定了基础。
    雪舟不仅向马远、夏圭、梁楷等宋元诸大家的作品学习，而且也极其谦虚地求师于和他同时代的明朝画家，因此，他在1468年来到了中国。当时他所画的署名“日本禅人等杨”的四幅“四季山水图”，说明着他是受了明代院画的影响的。但是雪舟作为一位艺术家，来到中国得到的最大的益处，却是他亲自游览了中国的山水。不管怎样，对于一个画家来说，最根本和最重要的，是要用自己的眼睛观察大自然，树立起自己的自然观。由于这点，雪舟比起同样承继了宋元画院传统的明代画家，例如雪舟本人也很推崇的李在等人，就有了更深刻的自然观和表现手法。
    也许有人会问：这样说来，雪舟岂不完全是一位中国画家了吗？对于这个问题，我的回答是：他和受到意大利文艺复兴的影响而出现的德国的丢勒，以及到意大利去留学、学习了文艺复兴时期的绘画、奠定了法国绘画基础的法国巨匠坡桑是相似的。雪舟的确是以中国宋元画为基础而发展他的创作的，但是在这一样式的领域内，他创造了独特的风格。我们就用实例来说明这点吧。
    我们可以把这次展览会上以原作同样大小的照片展出的“仿夏圭山水”和“秋冬山水”的“冬景”作一番比较。这两幅画的内容极其相似，但后者，即雪舟自己所创作的，在内容上比前者更坚实，岩石和岩石的配置以及远近法的运用都是非常合理的。特别是以岩壁垂直地切开画面中央部分的那种大胆的画法，是在夏圭的绘画里所看不到的，并且也跟现实的风景相矛盾，但是作为绘画却是真实的，它把单从自然界的外部看不出来的大自然的不变姿态，夸张地强烈地表现了出来。这是理解雪舟的画的重要关键。而这种艺术态度，是超越时间和国境的限制，而通向现代的世界美术的，我以为既古老又新颖的雪舟艺术的现实性就存在在这里。
    通过这次展览会，大家可以看到雪舟不仅工于山水画，而且也兼画花鸟和人物。特别是“益田兼尧”这幅日本封建时代领主的肖像，说明着雪舟也很熟悉大和绘的技法。通过雪舟的全部作品，我想大家会看出雪舟的画和中国画的难于用语言说明的微妙的不同，而这种不同是基于大陆和岛国的风土的差异的。
    我们现代画家，应向雪舟的艺术学习的地方，不是他的绘画题材，山石树木等等形、线、画法之类的表面的东西。这类东西，即使像雪舟这样的天才，也未能超出时代样式的范围之外，这里也有着雪舟的历史的局限性。现代的我们，光去模仿这些东西，我相信对于现代绘画是没有任何意义的。
    我们应该向雪舟学习的，是他反对当时因袭固守中国画形式的周文式的画风，而想创造出一种革新的艺术的那种雄浑的意志和坚强的精神，以及不单是从表面上描写和再现自然风景，而是像前面所说的，找出构成大自然的美的内在的东西，以独特的线和画来加以表现的那种艺术家的自由的态度。
      日本绘画，在十五世纪雪舟所奠定的基础上又向前发展，到了十六、七世纪，单纯从形式上模仿雪舟的一派画家衰落了，代之而起的是宗达和光琳这些反对这种因袭模仿的真正具有日本气派的伟大的画家，并且也出现了庶民艺术的浮世绘版画。浮世绘版画传到欧洲，后来成了西欧印象派色彩上的革新的前导。到了现代，继承了这些各式各样历史因素的传统的日本画，即相当于中国国画的绘画，在这八十年间，和从西洋学来的油画一道，又有了很大的发展变化。特别是战后十年来，日本画正在创造着新的样式。总之，不论是雪舟以前或雪舟以后，在各时代我们都拥有和雪舟作品同样的其他一些革新的优秀的美术遗产。这点，和中国的情况也完全相同。以这次举行雪舟纪念展览的机会为开始，今后逐步地把这些情况介绍给中国，中国也把美术界情况介绍给日本，我想这对于两国美术的发展是大有好处的，同时在加深两国人民的了解和友好关系上，也是大有好处的。如果能够这样，我想这次举行雪舟纪念展览会的意义就会是更深刻更广泛的了。
