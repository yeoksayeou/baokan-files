Xinhua News Agency, August 4th - Beijing's joint state-private enterprises have basically completed the distribution of private share dividends for the first half of the year. As of today, with just over a week remaining, over 97% of the dividends due have been paid out.

The method adopted for this distribution was to first issue dividends and then process shareholder registration and dividend receipt certificates. The payable interest was uniformly handed over to the original enterprise负责人 (person in charge), entrusting them to distribute it to each private shareholder. Thanks to their active assistance, the entire distribution work proceeded quickly and smoothly, and private shareholders quickly received their interest payments.

Capitalists were very happy after receiving their dividends and expressed their gratitude to the government. Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "This dividend distribution concretely embodies the Communist Party and the People's Government's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie. After joint operation, not only has our standard of living not decreased, but we still receive interest regardless of profit or loss. This is another profound education for us." Wang Minsheng, a member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The method of this dividend distribution is very good, demonstrating the government's full trust in capitalists, which is a great encouragement to us. Our Xinya Pharmaceutical Company lost money in the first half of the year, but we still received interest payments, providing a reliable guarantee for shareholders' livelihoods." Sun Yingbo, a shareholder of a joint state-private flour mill, said: "I received 12,500 yuan in dividends this time. I never expected such a generous interest rate." Liu Ruijiu, the former manager of the Beijing branch of the Shanghai Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, said: "The Beijing branch has been open for fifteen years and has always lost money. This is the first time I've received dividends."

    北京市公私合营企业
    上半年私股股息发放基本结束
    新华社4日讯　北京市公私合营企业发付上半年私股股息工作已经基本结束。到今天仅一周多的时间，全市应发的股息有97％以上已经发付。
    这次发付方法，采取了先发股息，然后再办理股东登记和发领息凭证等手续。并将应付息金统一交给原企业负责人，委托他代为发给各私股股东。由于他们的积极协助，整个发付工作进行得迅速、顺利，私股股东们很快就拿到了息金。
    资本家领到股息后非常高兴，表示感激政府。市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生说：“这次发息具体地体现了共产党和人民政府对资产阶级的和平改造政策。合营以后，生活不但不降低，赔赚还都给息，这对我们又是一次深刻的教育。”市工商业联合会委员王敏生说：“这次发息的办法很好，表现了政府对资本家的充分信任，对我们鼓励太大了。我们新药业上半年都赔钱，但也照样得到息金，使股东生活有了可靠保证。”公私合营面粉厂股东孙英波说：“这次我领到了一万二千五百元的股息，这样优厚的利息，是我没有想到的。”原上海新亚药厂北京分厂经理刘瑞久说：“北京分厂开办已经十五年了，一直赔钱，这次领到股息还是头一回。”
