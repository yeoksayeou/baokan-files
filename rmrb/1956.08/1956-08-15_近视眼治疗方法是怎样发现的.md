Comrade Zhang Yufu, head of the ophthalmology department of the People's Liberation Army's No. 169 Hospital, and all the comrades in the ophthalmology department under his leadership, discovered and adopted the method of using direct current electrical stimulation to treat refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, amblyopia, etc.) in their work. Since March 1955, they have treated 137 cases, involving 269 eyes. After measuring vision, 170 eyes were completely cured, 92 eyes showed improved vision, and only 7 eyes showed no improvement. The new myopia treatment method discovered by Comrade Zhang Yufu has been promoted and adopted in many hospitals. Although the long-term effects of this treatment method still need further observation, the excellent short-term efficacy is already very obvious.

For many years, the most common method of treating myopia has been optometry and prescribing glasses. However, many people with myopia cannot have their vision corrected even with glasses. Since Comrade Zhang Yufu began working in ophthalmology, he has often heard myopic patients asking doctors to cure them completely. In particular, he saw that some comrades in the army faced many difficulties in completing training and combat missions due to myopia. Therefore, Comrade Zhang Yufu was determined to study methods to completely cure myopia.

In March 1955, Comrade Zhang Yufu discovered a strange phenomenon in his ophthalmology work.

The situation was as follows: Zhou Guangqian, a typist in the hospital, had 150 degrees of myopia in his right eye. He was hospitalized for treatment of peripheral phlebitis of the retina in his left eye. He was treated with streptomycin iontophoresis, once a day for a total of five treatments. After the treatments, the myopia in his right eye improved significantly. After measuring vision, his left eye improved from 0.5 to 0.9, and his right eye improved from 0.3 to 2.0. This problem aroused great research interest in Comrade Zhang Yufu. He speculated that it might not be related to streptomycin, because streptomycin could not possibly have the effect of changing myopia. It was likely the effect of the electric current. Because of this problem, Comrade Zhang Yufu spent more than half a month of his spare time reading many medical books to find answers, but he found no clues. So he re-read various works of Pavlov's theory, carefully studied the relationship between the size of the current and the effectiveness of the treatment, studied the similarities and differences between the effects of current on local and closed therapies, and studied the causes of myopia, which gave him inspiration and encouragement.

While exploring the theory, the hospital party committee approved Comrade Zhang Yufu to conduct experimental treatments. However, the experiment was not smooth sailing. It was only after Comrade Zhang Yufu and all the comrades in the ophthalmology department painstakingly researched and overcame various difficulties that they achieved results. At the beginning, some patients did not believe in this new treatment method and were unwilling to accept it. But after they patiently persuaded them and explained the reasons, some people accepted the treatment. Comrade Zhang Yufu conducted a detailed analysis and research on the efficacy of all those who received treatment, and found that vision improved rapidly for those who had never worn glasses, and the treatment effect was definite. So, why was the efficacy poorer for those who wore glasses? Comrade Zhang Yufu re-studied the "additional conditioned reflex" part of Pavlov's theory. After repeated thinking and research with his comrades, he speculated that glasses might be hindering the improvement of vision. Therefore, they mobilized the comrades with myopia not to wear glasses during the treatment period, and the results showed the same significant effect. For example, because they initially applied the electrical therapy to the white of the eye, the patients were afraid of harming their eyes and had concerns, and they were very worried during the operation, resulting in low treatment efficiency. At this time, Comrade Zhang Yufu studied relevant physiology and anatomy books, improved the experimental methods, and did not use electrodes to contact the white of the eye, but used electrodes to contact the eyelids, temples, or upper eyelids. Treatment proved to have the same therapeutic effect, which significantly improved work efficiency, and patients were more willing to be treated.

Now, Comrade Zhang Yufu and other comrades in the ophthalmology department are continuing to experiment and research this therapy. In the ophthalmology work plan for 1956, they decided to complete the theoretical research work before the end of the year. They are full of confidence and determination to complete this task.

    近视眼治疗方法是怎样发现的
    曹蔚如
    人民解放军一六九医院眼科主任张玉符同志和他领导的眼科全体同志，在工作中发现和采用了平流电刺激疗法治疗屈光不正（近视、远视、散光、弱视等）的办法。从1955年3月以来，前后治疗了一百三十七个病例，二百六十九只眼睛，经过测量视力，一百七十只眼睛全好，九十二只眼睛的视力进步，只有七只眼睛没有进步。张玉符同志所发现的这种近视眼新疗法，在不少医院中被推广和采用了。这种治疗方法，虽然远期效果尚待进一步观察，但近期的优良疗效则已很明显。
    多少年来，治疗近视眼最通常的办法，就是验光配镜，但有不少害近视眼的人，即使配上眼镜，视力也不能补救。张玉符同志自从做眼科工作以来，经常听到近视患者要求医生给他们根治。特别是他看到部队有些同志由于近视，在完成训练和作战任务中增加了不少困难。于是，张玉符同志就决心研究根治近视眼病的方法。
    1955年3月，张玉符同志在眼科工作中发现了一个奇怪的现象。
    事情的经过情形是这样的：医院里的打字员周光前，右眼有一百五十度的近视，因左眼患网膜静脉周边炎住院治疗，对症采用了链霉素电游子透入疗法，每日治疗一次，共治疗五次以后，右眼的近视情况显著好转，测量视力，左眼由原来零点五进步到零点九，右眼由原来零点三进步到二点零。这个问题引起了张玉符同志极大的研究兴趣。他推想，可能与链霉素的关系不大，因为链霉素不可能有改变近视的效能，很可能是电流的作用。因为这个问题，张玉符同志曾经利用了半个多月的业余时间，翻阅了许多医学书籍，寻找答案，但是一点线索也没有得到。于是他又重新翻阅了巴甫洛夫学说的各种著作，用心研究了电流的大小和效果的好坏，研究了电流作用给局部与封闭疗法的异同，研究了近视的原因，因而得到了启示和鼓舞。
    在探索学理的同时，院党委批准了张玉符同志作试验性的治疗。但是，在试验中并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过了张玉符和眼科全体同志苦心钻研，克服了各种困难才获得成效的。开始时，有些病人不相信这种新疗法，不愿接受治疗，但经过他们耐心说服，讲清道理后，有些人才接受了治疗。张玉符同志对所有接受治疗的人员的疗效进行了细致的分析研究，发现凡是没有戴过眼镜的视力进步很快，治疗效果是肯定的。那末，戴眼镜的又为什么疗效较差呢？张玉符同志又重新研究了巴甫洛夫学说中“复加条件反射”一部分，经过反复思考，和同志们研究的结果，他推测可能是眼镜障碍了视力的进步。于是他们就动员患近视的同志在治疗期间不戴眼镜，结果疗效同样显著。再如因为他们首先采取的电疗部位是在白眼珠上，因此患者害怕伤害眼睛，存有顾虑，而且操作时担心很大，治疗效率很低。这时，张玉符同志又研究了有关生理学及解剖学方面的著作，改进了试验方法，不用电极接触白眼珠，而用电极接触眼皮或太阳穴或上眼皮，经过治疗证明有同样治疗效果，这样工作效率就显著地提高，病人也愿意治疗了。
    现在，张玉符同志和眼科其他同志对这一疗法正在继续进行试验和研究。在1956年的眼科工作规划中，他们决定在年底以前完成理论上的研究工作。他们对完成这项工作充满了信心和决心。（附图片）
