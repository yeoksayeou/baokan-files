    "Safe" Razor Blades
    I was very happy to see a Shanghai-produced "safe razor blade" at the People's Liberation Army Cooperative in Dengshikou, Beijing. Because most of the razor blades I used in the past were imported, I immediately bought a dozen when I saw a domestically produced one.

    When I got home, I used this razor blade to shave, but I couldn't hear any sound, and I didn't even feel a slight pain. I was so happy that I shaved and said, "These are really good razor blades." Unexpectedly, after shaving, I touched my face and found that not a single whisker had been shaved off. At first, I thought that the blade might not have been sharpened, so I changed to another one, then a third, and then a fourth... but the result was still the same.

    The comrades next to me laughed when they saw this. One comrade said, "The safe razor blades you bought are really 'safe' to the extreme; even whiskers are safely protected. If whiskers could talk, they would definitely be grateful to the factory that manufactures these safe razor blades." Zi Wei

    “安全”刀片
    我在北京灯市口军人合作社看到一种上海出产的“安全刀片”，心里很高兴。因为过去所用的刀片，大部分是进口货，现在见到国产的东西，一下就买了一打。
    回到家里，拿这种刀片刮起脸来，一点响声也听不到，连微痛的感觉也没有。我高兴得一边刮一边说：“真是好刀片。”不料刮完之后用手一摸，胡髭一根也没有被刮掉。最初以为可能是这个刀片没有开过刃，换了一片来用，接着换第三片、第四片……结果还是一样。
    旁边的同志见到这种情形，都大笑起来。一个同志说：“你买的安全刀片，真是‘安全’到家了，连胡髭也受到安全保护。如果胡髭会说话，一定要感激制造这种安全刀片的工厂。”　  自卫
