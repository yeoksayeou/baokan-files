    Beware of Conspiracies to Sabotage Sino-Burmese Relations

    On July 31st, the English-language newspaper "The Nation," published in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, carried a so-called "Burma Invaded" news item. This news item, which did not indicate its source, insisted that several hundred fully armed Chinese troops in the northern region of the Sino-Burmese border had advanced sixty miles along a five-hundred-mile-long line from their original defense line. While publishing the above news, the newspaper accused China of "reneging on its promises" and carrying out a so-called "naked and shameless invasion" of Burmese sovereignty, and so on.

    The news spread by the Burmese "The Nation" and its accusations against China are without any basis. The truth is that normal relations have been maintained between the two countries in the northern region of the Sino-Burmese border, and the Chinese border defense forces stationed there have always been stationed in their current defense area. As long as one notes the absurd military claims in "The Nation's" news that several hundred people could advance sixty miles along a five-hundred-mile-long line, one can see how ridiculous this news is.

    However, the American propaganda machine and certain people in Asia who fear nothing more than peace and stability considered this to be an opportunity. They immediately used the news from "The Nation" to vigorously provoke friendly relations between China and Burma, and to incite a tense atmosphere. They not only slandered China's peaceful foreign policy, but also ridiculed and attacked the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Burmese government. They even openly stated that Burma should be placed under the so-called "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, believing this was an excellent opportunity to drag Burma into the group.

    Under these circumstances, the Burmese government issued a statement on July 31st. The statement pointed out that "The Nation's" news was "untrue" and that the villages that "The Nation" insisted Chinese troops had occupied were still garrisoned by Burmese troops. They maintained radio contact with the relevant command headquarters. At the same time, the Minister for Kachin State Affairs of Burma, Zahtay, also told the press that he had not reported to the government any issue of Chinese troops advancing in the undetermined border area in northern Burma. This fully proves that the news from "The Nation" was completely fabricated.

    However, the Burmese government's statement also said that in the southern region of the Sino-Burmese border, Chinese troops had "entered Burmese territory in Wa State" and established "forward outposts" there. The Burmese "The Nation" on August 1st again vigorously publicized that China had "invaded" Burmese territory in the southern region, and repeated its bankrupt lie that Chinese troops had advanced in the northern region.

    It should be pointed out that the Burmese government's statement did not explain a very important situation. That is, the area mentioned in the statement is precisely the undetermined border area in the southern section of the Sino-Burmese border. On the issue of the demarcation of this border section, Burma has a different view from China. This difference should be resolved through consultations between the two countries, and not through any other means. Before the border issue is resolved, both sides should temporarily maintain the status quo, and the Chinese border defense forces have always been stationed in the existing defense area in this friendly spirit. In this case, there is no question of "entering" the other party's territory.

    China and Burma have always had friendly relations, and these relations have further developed in recent years. The Prime Ministers of China and Burma, together with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which are the solid foundation for the consolidation and development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations. The facts of the past six years have proved that the Chinese government has faithfully implemented a peaceful and good-neighborly foreign policy and resolutely adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve existing problems and differences with the Burmese government and other governments through peaceful consultation. We believe that the Burmese government also has the same intention.

    Regarding the issue of the Sino-Burmese border, former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu held discussions with the Chinese government during his visit to China in 1954. The joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma issued on December 12, 1954, stated that "in view of the fact that the Sino-Burmese border has not yet been completely demarcated, the two Prime Ministers believe that it is necessary to resolve this issue through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time, in accordance with the spirit of friendship." The solution to the Sino-Burmese border issue should obviously follow this mutually agreed upon approach. Before the Sino-Burmese border is formally demarcated, the two countries should temporarily maintain the status quo and prevent the occurrence of disputes. The Chinese border defense forces in the undetermined areas in the southern and northern Sino-Burmese borders strictly abide by this principle of maintaining the status quo. We believe that this is in the interests of the peoples of China and Burma, and also in the interests of peace in Asia.

    This can be clearly seen from the reaction caused after the Burmese "The Nation" spread fabricated news. Regardless of the intention of "The Nation" in fabricating this news, it provided an opportunity for those who are intent on creating trouble in Asia and creating a tense situation. From their remarks, it can be seen that they are not only hostile to the Chinese people, but also harbor ill intentions towards the Burmese people. At present, the situation in the world and Asia is tending towards relaxation. The enemies of peace are doing everything possible to provoke and sabotage, trying to achieve their goal of dividing Asia and implementing a divide-and-rule policy in Asia. Both China and Burma are countries that bear a major responsibility for maintaining peace in Asia, so we should be more vigilant and strengthen mutual friendship and unity, so that those who disrupt peace have no means to use their skills. We believe that with the joint efforts of our two peoples, all conspiracies to provoke and sabotage the relations between our two countries are bound to fail.

### 警惕破坏中缅关系的阴谋

    警惕破坏中缅关系的阴谋
    7月31日，在缅甸首都仰光出版的英文报纸“民族报”，刊载了一条所谓“缅甸被侵入了”的消息。这条没有注明来源的消息硬说，有武装全备的中国军队几百人，在中、缅两国边境的北部地区，从原有防线沿着五百英里长的一线向前推进了六十英里。这家报纸在发表上述消息的同时，指责中国“背弃自己的诺言”、对缅甸主权进行所谓“赤裸裸的和无耻的侵犯”等等。
    缅甸“民族报”所散布的这个消息和它对中国的指责，是没有任何根据的。事实的真相是：在中、缅边境的北部地区，两国之间一直维持着正常的关系，在那里的中国边防部队一直就驻守着现在的防区。只要注意到“民族报”的消息中几百个人居然能在五百英里长的一线上推进六十英里这种毫无军事常识的说法，就可以知道这个消息是多么荒唐无稽。
    可是美国的宣传机器和亚洲某些惟恐天下不乱的人，却认为这是一个可乘之机。他们立刻利用“民族报”的这个消息，大肆挑拨中、缅两国之间的友好关系，煽动紧张空气。他们不但对中国的和平外交政策进行诬蔑，而且对缅甸政府所奉行的和平中立政策也进行了嘲笑和攻击。他们甚至公开表示要把缅甸放在东南亚集团的所谓“保护”之下，认为这是把缅甸拖进东南亚集团的绝好机会。
    在这种情势下，缅甸政府在七月三十一日发表了一项声明。声明指出“民族报”的消息是“不真实的”，并且指出被“民族报”硬说中国军队已经进驻的几个村庄，目前仍然驻有缅甸的部队。他们同有关的指挥部保持着无线电联系。同时，缅甸的克钦邦事务部长扎泰也向报界说，他并没有向政府提出过中国军队在中缅北部未定界向前推进的问题。这就充分证明了“民族报”的消息完全是出于捏造的。
    然而，缅甸政府的声明中又说，在中缅边境南部地区有中国军队“进入了缅甸领土瓦邦”。并且在那里建立了“前哨哨岗”。缅甸“民族报”就在八月一日又大肆宣传中国在南部地区“侵犯了”缅甸领土。并且重复它那已经破产了的硬说中国军队在北部地区推进的谎言。
    应当指出，缅甸政府的声明没有交代一项十分重要的情况。这就是声明所提的地区正是中缅边境南段未定界地带。在这段边界划分的问题上，缅甸有着同中国不同的看法。这种分歧应该通过两国协商来求得解决，而不应该求之于任何其他途径。在划界问题未解决以前，双方应该暂时维持现状，而中国的边防部队一直就是本着这种友好的精神驻防在现有的防区之内。在这种情况下，根本不发生什么“进入”对方领土的问题。
    中、缅两国之间一向有着友好的关系，这种关系近年来并且有了进一步的发展。中、缅两国总理同印度总理尼赫鲁一起倡导了和平共处的五项原则，这些原则也就是中、缅友好关系巩固和发展的坚实基础。六年来的事实证明，中国政府忠实地执行了和平睦邻的外交政策，坚决遵守和平共处的五项原则。中国政府一再表示愿意通过和平协商的办法，来同缅甸政府以及其他国家政府解决相互间存在的问题和分歧。我们相信，缅甸政府也是具有同样的意愿的。
    关于中、缅两国边界的问题，前缅甸总理吴努在1954年访问中国的时候，曾经同中国政府进行了商谈。1954年12月12日发表的中缅两国总理会谈公报说，“鉴于中缅两国边界尚未完全划定，两国总理认为，有必要根据友好精神，在适当时机内，通过正常外交途径，解决此项问题。”中缅两国边境问题的解决，显然应该遵循这一双方一致同意的途径。在中缅边界还没有正式划定以前，两国应该暂时维持现状，同时防止纠纷的发生，中国边防部队在中缅南、北未定界地区就是严格遵守这个维持现状的原则的。我们认为，这是符合于中、缅两国人民的利益，也符合于亚洲和平的利益的。
    这一点，从缅甸“民族报”散布捏造的消息以后所引起的反应，可以看得很清楚。不管“民族报”捏造这个消息的意图是什么，但是它给那些存心在亚洲兴风作浪、制造紧张局势的人提供了一个机会。从他们的言论中可以看出，他们不但对于中国人民抱有敌意，而且对于缅甸人民也是同样不怀好意的。目前世界和亚洲的局势在趋于和缓，和平的敌人正在千方百计地进行挑拨和破坏，想达到他们分裂亚洲、对亚洲实行分而治之的目的。中、缅两国都是对维护亚洲和平负有重大责任的国家，因此更应该提高警惕，加强相互间的友好和团结，使得和平破坏者无所用其技。我们相信，在我们两国人民的共同努力之下，一切挑拨和破坏我们两国关系的阴谋是必然要失败的。
