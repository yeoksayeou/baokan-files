Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd. More than 100,080 family members of young and middle-aged men and women who migrated from Shandong Province to Heilongjiang Province this March and April have been properly settled by the local governments and agricultural production cooperatives in terms of production and living.

    All localities have incorporated the labor force among the immigrant families into agricultural production cooperatives in a unified plan, enabling them to actively engage in production, basically achieving the requirement of "no falling behind in production and no reduction in living standards." For example, the families of Zheng Jiying and Chen Yantian, members of the land reclamation team in Woniu Township, Licheng County, did not participate in labor in the past. After the land reclamation team members left, the agricultural production cooperative helped them solve the difficulties of food and childcare, and they actively participated in labor within the cooperative. After the wheat harvest, the families of these two land reclamation team members not only solved their living difficulties but were also rated as second-class labor models in the cooperative.

    All counties have assigned light and odd jobs to family members who are weak in labor or widowed, orphaned, or alone, according to their labor, age, and physical conditions, so that they have a certain income. Liu Jichang of Yanglou Township, Shanggao District, Tai'an County, is already fifty-six years old. After his son joined the land reclamation team, the cooperative asked him to look after the waterwheel. By the wheat harvest, he had earned a total of 600 work points and received more than 800 catties of wheat. He said happily: "I have never harvested so much wheat in my fifty or sixty years. This year, I received more than 800 catties in one season and became a surplus grain household." Some counties and districts also mobilized social mutual assistance or provided advance loans or subsidies of work points from agricultural production cooperatives to solve the problems for families with less labor and more people or families with temporary difficulties in life.

    Many county, district, and township people's governments or agricultural production cooperatives held family member forums before the land reclamation team members moved away, conducting education on building the motherland and the glory of land reclamation for the family members, and providing relief arrangements for family members with difficulties in production and life, which made the family members of the land reclamation team members very satisfied. After the spring land reclamation team members moved away, the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heze County promptly conducted a comprehensive survey of the labor, ideology, and living conditions of the team members' families, and formulated a plan to make specific and proper arrangements for each person, each household, and each season. According to a survey of thirteen immigrant families in this cooperative, nine of them received more wheat than in previous years in the wheat season pre-distribution because they participated in production labor. For the other four families, due to the large population and weak labor force, the cooperative used methods such as advance loans of work points, subsidies, or relief according to their situation to solve their living difficulties.

### 山东移民的家属十万多人  得到政府和农业社的妥善安置

    山东移民的家属十万多人
    得到政府和农业社的妥善安置
    新华社济南22日电　山东省今年三、四月份移往黑龙江省的十万零八千多个男女青壮年的家属，在生产上和生活上都得到了当地政府和农业生产合作社的较为妥善的安置。
    各地都把移民家属中的劳动力统一规划到农业生产合作社，使他们积极投入生产，基本上达到了“生产不掉队、生活不降低”的要求。如历城县卧牛乡垦荒队员郑吉英、陈延田的家属，过去不参加劳动，垦荒队员走后，农业生产合作社帮助她们解决了吃粮和看孩子的困难问题，她们便积极参加了社内劳动。麦收后，这两个垦荒队员的家属不但解决了生活上的困难，还被评为社内二等劳动模范。
    各县对于劳力弱或鳏、寡、孤、独的家属，都根据他们的劳力、年龄、身体条件，分别分配给他们轻活零活，使他们有一定收入。泰安县上高区羊楼乡的刘纪昌已经五十六岁，他儿子参加垦荒队后，社内就叫他看水车，他到麦收时共得了六百个工分，分到麦子八百多斤。他高兴地说：“我活了五六十岁还没打过这么多麦子，今年一季就分了八百多斤，成了余粮户。”有些县、区对于劳力少人口多或家庭生活暂时有困难的家属，还发动社会互济，或由农业生产合作社预借工分或补助工分来解决。
    不少县、区、乡级人民政府或农业生产合作社，在垦荒队员没有迁走以前，就召开了家属座谈会，对家属进行了建设祖国和垦荒光荣的教育，并且对生产上和生活上有困难的家属进行了救济安排，使垦荒队员的家属都很满意。菏泽县东方红农业生产合作社，在春季垦荒队员迁走之后，及时对队员家属进行了劳力、思想、生活情况的摸底排队，并且制定了计划，逐人、逐户、逐季地作了具体而妥善的安排。据这个社十三户移民家属的调查，其中九户因为参加生产劳动，在麦季预分中都分到比往年还多的小麦。其他四户家属，因人口多劳力弱，社内就根据他们的情况，分别用了预借工分、补助或救济等办法，解决了他们生活上的困难问题。
