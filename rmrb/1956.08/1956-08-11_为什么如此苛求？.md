    In June of this year, representatives from the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, holding the "Labor Force Allocation List" from the Beijing Labor Bureau, went to the Beijing Dongsi District Labor Allocation Office to request assistance in recruiting eighty-eight staff members. Most of these were to be trained as tracers and draftsmen, with two nursery workers and two cooks. The requirements were: aged eighteen to thirty, with a higher elementary or junior high school education. Except for the two nursery workers, who were required to be female, the remaining eighty-six could be male or female.
    In order to meet the requirements of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute, the Beijing Dongsi District Labor Allocation Office provided 1,200 registration forms of unemployed and jobless people for the Black Metallurgical Design Institute to choose from. However, they did not recruit according to the originally stipulated conditions. Out of the 1,200 people, they only selected seventy-six as potential recruits. Although the Labor Allocation Office felt that the requirements were too strict at the time, the selection of more than seventy people was still close to the numbers they requested. Unexpectedly, only thirteen were finally hired, and the remaining sixty-three registration forms were all returned.
    It is not necessary to delve into how overly strict the Black Metallurgical Design Institute was in selecting from the 1,200 registration forms; even the return of the sixty-three people is very unreasonable. Among these sixty-three people, there were fourteen Communist Party members and eight Communist Youth League members. Some, although not Party or League members, were politically reliable or relatively reliable. In addition, their age, health conditions, and education levels all met their recruitment conditions. For example, a young woman named Wang Shulan, a member of the Communist Youth League, twenty-two years old, and a graduate of higher elementary school, was not hired. Among the returned personnel, there were many young people who had just graduated from elementary school last year. With proper training, it would be entirely possible for them to become tracers or draftsmen, but these people were not hired.
    The actions of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute not only added difficulties to the labor allocation work and delayed the prospects of many unemployed young people, but in fact also damaged their own recruitment plans.

### 为什么如此苛求？

    为什么如此苛求？
    今年六月里，冶金工业部黑色冶金设计院的代表，拿着北京市劳动局的“劳动力调配单”，到北京东四区劳动调配所，要求协助他们招考八十八名工作人员。这中间大部分准备培养成描图员和制图员，另有保育员两人，炊事员两人。要求条件是：年满十八岁到三十岁，和高小毕业或初中的文化程度。除两名保育员规定要女性以外，其余八十六名男女均可。
    北京东四区劳动调配所，为了满足黑色冶金设计院的要求，曾先后提供了一千二百份失业和无业人员的登记表，让黑色冶金设计院从中挑选，但他们并没有按照原来规定的那些条件录取。在一千二百人中，他们仅挑出了七十六人作为录用对象。当时劳动调配所虽也感到要求太严，但挑出七十多人，总还算接近了他们所要求的数字。不料最后却只录用了十三名，其余六十三份登记表，又全部退回来了。
    黑色冶金设计院在一千二百份登记表中，挑选得过苛过严，先不必去管；单就退回来的六十三人来说，也有很没有道理的。这六十三人中，有十四名共产党员，有八名青年团员，有些虽不是党、团员，但都是政治上可靠或比较可靠的。另外，年岁、健康条件、文化程度也全合乎他们的招收条件。例如有一个叫王淑兰的女青年，是青年团员，今年二十二岁，高小毕业，也没有被录取。在退回的人员中，有很多都是去年小学刚毕业的青年，只要加以培养，成为一个描图员或制图员完全是可能的，但这些人都没有被录取。
    黑色冶金设计院这种作法，不只是给劳动调配工作增加了困难，延误了许多无业青年的前途，事实上也损害了他们本身的招工计划。
