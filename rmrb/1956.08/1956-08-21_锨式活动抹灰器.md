    Shovel-Type Mobile Plastering Tool
    Bu Jinsheng, a plasterer at the Northwest Medical College construction site of the Xi'an City Third Construction Company, has created an advanced plastering tool—the shovel-type mobile plastering tool. This tool resembles a wooden-handled iron shovel, but the left, right, and back of the shovel head have stops, like a dustpan. During operation, it's like using a large brush to paste advertisements, applying a shovel of plaster from the bottom to the top of the wall. An ordinary plasterer can plaster more than 140 square meters a day using this plastering tool, exceeding the state quota by nearly two times. It takes a normal worker more than a year to master general plastering techniques, at the fastest, but with the shovel-type mobile plastering tool, it only takes two or three days to learn how to do general plastering work.
    Comrade Bu Jinsheng is an old worker with twenty years of experience who used to be very sluggish in his work. After the launch of the Advanced Producer Movement this year, he felt ashamed of his backwardness and actively researched and experimented with the shovel-type mobile plastering tool. Now, Xi'an Third Construction Company is manufacturing this tool on a large scale, preparing to promote it throughout the company.

    锨式活动抹灰器
    西安市第三工程公司西北医学院工地粉刷工卜金升创造了一种先进的粉刷工具——锨式活动抹灰器。这个工具像一个木把铁锨，不过铁锨头的左、右和后面都有挡头，像个簸箕。操作的时候就像用大刷子贴广告一样，把一锨灰从墙下部抹到墙上部。一个普通的粉刷工使用这种抹灰器，一天能抹一百四十多平方公尺，超过国家定额将近二倍。一个普通工人要掌握一般粉刷技术，最快也得一年多，用锨式活动抹灰器，只要学两三天就能做一般的粉刷活。
    卜金升同志是个有二十年工龄的老工人，过去工作很疲沓。今年开展先进生产者运动以后，他感到自己落后的可耻，就积极钻研和试验锨式活动抹灰器。现在西安第三工程公司正在大量制造这种工具，准备在全公司普遍推广。
