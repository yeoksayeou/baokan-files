    This is the third batch of Japanese war criminals released by the Chinese government this year. Thus far, all 1,062 Japanese war criminals held in custody in China have been dealt with by our government.

After the decision was announced, five of the released Japanese war criminals, including Ishigaki Rinnosuke, spoke on the spot, repeatedly expressing their gratitude to the Chinese people for their leniency.

    Prior to this, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country had released 663 Japanese war criminals with lighter crimes and signs of repentance in two batches in June and July of this year. In addition, forty-five Japanese war criminals with serious crimes have been tried by the Special Military Tribunal organized by the Supreme People's Court of our country and sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment.
