    An Appeal from the Greater Khingan Range
    We are all migrant workers from Hebei, Liaoning and other provinces who recently came to the Greater Khingan Range to participate in the forest industry construction of the Northeast Forest Railway Engineering Office. In order to develop the timber resources of the Greater Khingan Range as soon as possible and support construction in various regions, we have all accepted the glorious task assigned by our superiors of "turning the forest area into a paradise" with great excitement.

    Although the climate here is relatively harsh, often reaching tens of degrees below zero in winter, and now - in July - it often rains two or three times a day, we are confident in completing the tasks assigned by the state. If there is no house to live in, we pitch tents; if there is no kitchen, we build simple sheds. However, we must also appeal: some problems that must be resolved are not resolved by the leadership in a timely manner, or not resolved at all, which seriously affects our work. The first is the untimely supply of tools. When we enter the construction site and are about to start working, we do not have shovels, which has caused serious delays. The second is that the labor protection conditions are very poor. This is a mountainous area, and there are many mosquitoes. 80% of us do not have mosquito prevention equipment. Everywhere you can see workers swatting mosquitoes while working. Many comrades have been bitten by mosquitoes, leaving red welts like cherries on their bodies. It rains a lot here, but many of us don't have rubber shoes, so we have to stand in the water to work, soaking our feet until they resemble leavened dough. After working all day, we want a good place to rest at night, but in the tent, on the one hand, mosquitoes bite, and on the other hand, it leaks rain, and the quilt is often wet enough to wring water out. We have raised these issues to the leadership more than once, asking them to find ways to resolve them, but suggestions remain suggestions and are not resolved. In order to improve working conditions and enable us to do more work, we demand that these problems be resolved quickly.

### 来自大兴安岭的呼吁

    来自大兴安岭的呼吁
    我们都是最近从河北、辽宁等省来到大兴安岭参加森林工业建设的东北森林铁路工程处的民工。为了早日把大兴安岭的木材开发出来，支援各地建设，我们都以极其兴奋的心情，接受了上级交给的“把林区变为乐园”的光荣任务。
    虽然这里气候比较恶劣，到冬天常常冷到零下几十度，现在——七月里常常一天下两三次雨，但是我们都有信心完成国家的任务。没有房子住，我们支帐棚；没有厨房，我们架芦席。可是，我们也必须呼吁：由于一些必须解决的问题，领导上不及时解决，或不给解决，也严重地影响了我们的工作。首先是工具供应不及时，我们进入工地，就要开始工作的时候，没有铁锹，曾造成了严重的窝工现象。其次是劳动保护条件很差。这里是山地，蚊子很多。我们中有80％的人没有防蚊设备。到处可以看到工人们一边工作，一边赶蚊子。很多同志们的身上，都被蚊子咬出一颗颗像樱桃似的红癍。这里雨多，但我们很多人没有胶鞋，只好站在水里干活，把脚都泡成发面馒头似的。白天干一天活本想晚上有个好的休息地方，可是帐棚里一方面蚊子咬，另一方面又漏雨，被子湿得常常可以拧出水来。这些问题，我们不只一次向领导上提出，请领导上设法解决，可是意见归意见，就是得不到解决。为了改善工作条件，使我们作更多的工作，要求赶快解决这些问题。
