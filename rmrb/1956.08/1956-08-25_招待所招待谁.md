    Who Do Guest Houses Host?
    Xiao Wen
    A comrade from the Chongqing Municipal Committee accompanied me to the Chongqing No. 1 Guest House—formerly the Southwest Administrative Committee Auditorium—at noon under the scorching sun.
    I had just put down my luggage when the receptionist followed. The first question was, "What level cadre is he?" This stunned me. I thought: perhaps there are too many guests and too few rooms, so they have to classify by rank.
    After lunch, I took a look around the building and found that most of the rooms were empty. Then I strolled down the street and saw more guest houses: the Second Guest House, the Third Guest House, the "Chongqing Hotel," guest houses of such-and-such department or such-and-such organization, a variety of names. I didn't go in. I wouldn't dare say these places were necessarily deserted, but it was a fact that people were not bustling in and out. With so many guest houses, are they uninhabited? Or are there people who can't get accommodation?
    At night, an old classmate accompanied me to the Pipashan Park. In our casual conversation, we inevitably touched upon the difficulties of traveling. He said, "Wuhan also has many guest houses, but the year before last when we went to Beijing and passed through Wuhan, we didn't have a letter of introduction, nor did we contact the local leaders, and we simply couldn't find a place to stay." Speaking of Chongqing, he also brought up a recent incident: not long ago, he and the former director of the Foreign Affairs Office were strolling down the street and wanted to take a look at the No. 1 Guest House, but because they were pedestrians, the doorman wouldn't let them in.
    Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing all have various kinds of guest houses; and wherever you go, you will hear travelers lamenting the difficulty of finding accommodation. However, no one or no place has ever resolved to unify the management of these guest houses and open them up. The result is that the division of labor among departments becomes more detailed, the more rooms guest houses occupy, the more numerous the travelers without accommodation become, and the lamentations never cease.
    If the vast majority of guest houses could be converted into hotels and managed as an enterprise, so that it wouldn't matter whether you arrived by car or on foot, and accommodation wasn't determined by rank... the state could increase revenue, and travelers would be more comfortable. What could be better?
    But then again, haven't these suggestions been around for a long time? Why is it still a problem now? I thought of a conversation with a comrade from Chongqing:
    "The People's Daily criticized the Southwest Administrative Committee Auditorium last year for its wasteful construction and low utilization rate. What are your thoughts?"
    "It's nothing, those are things we already knew."
    I think that's the problem. Although they already knew, they are unwilling to correct it; since they don't correct it, they slowly become accustomed to this unreasonable phenomenon.
    I hope that the comrades in Chongqing will tell people next time that the utilization rate of the No. 1 Guest House has reached 50%, 60%, or more.
    I hope that the first sentence travelers hear from receptionists will be: "Comrade, you must be tired from your journey, please rest!"
    Even more, I hope that the doors of guest houses everywhere will be open to travelers, "To acquire thousands upon thousands of rooms, may all travelers in the world be happy!"

### 招待所招待谁

    招待所招待谁
    肖文
    重庆市委的一位同志，在赤日炎炎的中午陪我到了重庆市第一招待所——从前的西南行政委员会大礼堂。
    刚刚把行李放下，招待员也尾随而来了。第一句话就是：“他是那一级干部？”这一下使我楞住了。我想：可能是客多房少，不能不分分等级。
    饭后，到大楼四周瞧瞧，原来绝大部分房间都是空着的。再到街头逛一遭，看到了更多的招待所：第二招待所、第三招待所、“重庆宾馆”、某某部或某某机关的招待所，名目繁多。我没有进去，不敢说这些地方一定是冷冷清清的，但进出的人并不熙熙攘攘，却是事实。这么多的招待所，是不住人呢？或是没有人住呢？
    夜间，一位老同学陪我登上枇杷山公园。闲谈中不禁又扯到旅途的艰难。他说：“武汉也有不少招待所，可是前年我们到北京去，路过武汉，没带介绍信，也没找当地的负责人，就简直找不到住的地方。”说到重庆，他也扯起一件近事：不久以前，他和交际处的前任处长蹓大街，想进第一招待所看看，因为是步行客，门房不让进。
    北京、上海、武汉以及重庆，到处都有各色各样的招待所；而你走到任何一个地方，也都会听到旅客们感叹住房困难。可是，从没有一个人或一个地方决心把这些招待所统一管理起来，开放开来。结果是部门分工越细，招待所占用的房间越多，无处住宿的旅客也越众，而感叹也迄无终止。
    如果能把绝大多数招待所改为旅馆，作为一项企业办理，进门不必分车行步行，住房不先问几等几级……国家既可增加收入，旅客也得到方便，何乐而不为呢？
    话又得说回来，难道这些意见不是早已有之的吗？为什么现在还成为问题？我想起了同重庆市一位同志的对话：
    “人民日报去年批评西南行政委员会大礼堂建筑浪费和利用率太低，你们的意见如何？”
    “没有什么，那都是我们早已知道了的事。”
    我想，问题就在这里。虽然早已知道了，就是不愿意改正；既然不去改正，慢慢就把这种不合理的现象看得不以为奇了。
    希望重庆市的同志下次将告诉人们：第一招待所的利用率已达到了50％、60％或者更多。
    希望旅客们听到招待员的第一句话将是：同志，旅途辛苦了，请休息吧！
    更希望各地招待所的大门都向旅客开放，“调整广厦千万间，愿使天下旅客俱欢颜”。
