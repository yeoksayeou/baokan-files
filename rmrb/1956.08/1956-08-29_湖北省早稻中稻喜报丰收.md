    Hubei Province Reports Bumper Harvest of Early and Mid-Season Rice

    (Our report) The autumn harvest season has arrived. In the rice paddies of the broad areas along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province, boundless golden waves are rolling. Tens of thousands of farmers are wielding their gleaming sickles to harvest rice. The threshing grounds are filled with the sound of threshing. The countryside everywhere presents a joyous scene of a bountiful harvest.
    This year, the total output of early and mid-season rice in the province is estimated to increase by approximately 1.6 billion jin compared to the bumper harvest of 1955, an average increase of about 10%. Jiangling County's million mu of mid-season rice is expected to increase by 30% to 40% compared to last year.
    After agricultural cooperation in Hubei Province, agricultural cooperatives in various localities implemented production reforms in accordance with local conditions. In addition to preparing large amounts of fertilizer last winter, which generally advanced the rice seedling transplanting period by 10 days to half a month this year, agricultural cooperatives in various localities also widely adopted measures such as sowing sparse seedlings, transplanting strong seedlings, implementing close planting, strengthening field management, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, creating many favorable conditions for this year's bumper harvest. This year, the planting area of double-cropping rice in the province was expanded, and the total output of early rice in the province increased by more than 60% compared to last year. Many paddy fields converted from dry land have yielded a harvest this autumn season equivalent to one or two years' grain harvests in the past.

    湖北省早稻中稻喜报丰收
    本报讯　秋收季节到了。湖北省长江、汉水两岸广大地区的稻田里，翻滚着一望无际的金黄色的波浪。成千上万的农民挥舞着闪闪发亮的镰刀在收割水稻。稻场里一片打谷声。农村中到处呈现着欢腾的丰收景象。
    今年全省早稻和中稻的总产量估计将比丰收的1955年增产约十六亿斤，平均增产一成左右。江陵县的百万亩中稻，预计较去年增产三成至四成。
    湖北省农业合作化以后，各地农业社因地制宜地实行了生产改革。除了去年冬天准备了大量肥料，使今年水稻播秧期一般提早十天到半月外，各地农业社并广泛采取播稀秧、插壮秧、实行密植、加强田间管理和防治病虫害等措施，为今年的丰收创造了许多有利的条件。今年全省双季稻的种植面积扩大，全省的早稻总产量比去年增加了60％以上。许多由旱地改成的水田，今年一季秋收就相当往年一两年的粮食收成。
