    Dalian, August 24th (From Our Own Correspondent) – The Dalian Motor Factory, after criticizing the erroneous thinking of demanding everything new, has revised its initial technical renovation plan formulated in June, based on the principles of fully utilizing existing factory buildings and equipment, closely integrating with current production, and achieving small investment with large returns. According to the new plan, the factory will complete its technical renovation by the end of 1957, and the output value in 1958 will increase by 172.3% compared to this year's planned output value. The entire investment in technical renovation will be recovered from the increased profits remitted within five months after the renovation is completed.

    The original plan formulated by the factory in June had many shortcomings: excessive demolition of old equipment, large investment, and prolonged production stoppage during construction, affecting the completion of current production tasks. Furthermore, the overall layout was not rational enough. The unreasonable situation of the main production workshop, the AC motor workshop, having an overly long process route could not be changed, resulting in long auxiliary production time, dispersed production area, and hindering the adoption of new technologies.

    The newly formulated technical renovation plan embodies the principle of small investment and large returns. It can reduce the demolition of old factory buildings by 1,476 square meters, reduce investment by more than 210,000 yuan, and increase revenue by 5 million yuan due to avoiding production stoppages. After completing these technical renovation projects, the output of the factory's three main products will be significantly increased. Comparing the planned output for 1958 with this year's, AC motors will increase by 233%, DC motors by 114%, and oil pumps by 100%. In terms of output per unit area, the annual output of units per square meter in 1958 will increase from 13.4 units this year to 19.7 units.

    Through technical renovation, the factory's technical level will be greatly improved. After the technical renovation is completed, they can use combined machine tools and various semi-automatic machine tools when processing the three main components of motors: machine bases, end caps, and shafts. Currently, the off-line and assembly processes in the workshop use trolleys and manual labor to transport parts. By 1958, all parts will be transported by roller conveyors. In the past, the factory did not have a central laboratory and lacked research-based testing of raw materials, purchased parts, and finished products. According to the technical renovation plan, a central laboratory will be established by the end of this year to conduct various research-based tests.

    充分利用旧有厂房设备，密切结合当前生产
    大连电机厂重订技术改造方案
    技术改造完成后，年产值可以提高一倍半，五个月就能收回全部投资
    本报大连24日电　大连电机厂批判了一切要换新的错误思想，根据充分利用旧有厂房和设备、密切结合当前生产和投资小、收益大的原则，否定了今年六月制定的第一个技术改造方案，而制定了新的技术改造方案。根据新的方案，这个工厂到1957年底将完成企业的技术改造，1958年的产值将比今年的计划产值提高172.3％，技术改造的全部投资将在改造完成后的五个月内从增加的上缴利润中收回。这个工厂在今年六月制定的方案有许多缺点：拆除旧的设备过多，投资大，并且在施工期中要长时期停产，影响当前生产任务的完成；另外，对总体布置的也不够合理，主要生产车间——交流电机车间的工艺路线过长的不合理情况不能得到改变，使生产辅助时间长，生产面积分散，不利于采用新技术。现在制定的新的技术改造方案体现了投资小收益大的原则，可少拆除旧厂房面积一千四百七十六平方公尺，减少投资二十一万多元，并且由于可以避免停产，会增加五百万元的收入。完成这些技术改造项目后，这个工厂的三种主要产品的产量都将有显著提高。以1958年和今年计划产量对比，交流电机提高233％，直流电机提高114％，油泵提高100％。从单位作业面积的产量来看，1958年每平方公尺年产台数可由今年的十三点四台提高到十九点七台。经过技术改造，这个工厂的技术水平将得到很大提高。技术改造完成后，他们在加工机座、端盖、轴等三种电机的主要部件时都可采用联动机床和各种半自动机床。现在车间的下线和装配等工序是用小车和人力传送部件的，到1958年各种部件都将由滚轴传送。这个工厂过去没有中心试验室，对原材料，外购件和成品都缺乏研究性的试验。根据技术改造方案规定，到今年年底这个工厂就将出现一座中心试验室，来从事各项研究性的试验。
