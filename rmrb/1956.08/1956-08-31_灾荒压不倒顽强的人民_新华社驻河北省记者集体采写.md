Like Brothers
On the evening of August 6th, when members of three agricultural cooperatives in Dongliuhang Township, Wuqing County, heard that some agricultural cooperatives in the Yongding River area had suffered from floods, they immediately organized a rescue team of twenty young and strong men. That night, led by Zhang Yihe, the secretary of the township's general Party branch, these young men sailed six small wooden boats, braving the wind and waves, towards the flood-stricken villages. Their families also busied themselves clearing out houses and gathering firewood, preparing to welcome the disaster-stricken brothers. After midnight, the rescue team rescued thirty-nine households of Cizhou Village from the flood's encirclement. Cadres and members of the three agricultural cooperatives in Dongliuhang Township immediately led them to the two hundred-plus rooms that had been cleared out, and sent them two thousand catties of freshly ground flour and five thousand catties of prepared firewood. The rescue team also helped the victims salvage grain, clothing, and other items, rescuing all salvageable property in two days and two nights. The seventy mu of vacant land by the fields and villages of the three agricultural cooperatives in Dongliuhang Township were given to these thirty-nine households to grow vegetables. Aunt Liu from Cizhou Village, with tears in her eyes, said to the members of Dongliuhang Township: "I have lived for most of my life, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have there been such good things. You treat us truly like brothers."

An Ordinary Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party
All 1,480 mu of crops in the Tongjian Agricultural Cooperative of Ximag 각 Village, Anci County, were flooded, and a tenth of the village's houses collapsed. Many members were frowning and hanging their heads in sorrow.

What to do in the face of disaster? The village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Ximag 각 Village convened a meeting of the branch committee and the management committee of the agricultural cooperative to calculate the sideline production that could be carried out, as well as the income from sidelines and the funds for overcoming the famine. After everyone searched east and west, they made a production plan for the entire cooperative to overcome the famine. After seven types of sideline production, such as weaving bamboo mats, fishing, and making insoles, were launched, the income for three months could provide food for all 350 people in the cooperative for five months. They told the members about this plan, and the members raised their heads. The village branch immediately sent people to the Anci County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and relevant units in Beijing to sign purchase and sale contracts for bamboo mats, etc., which could generate a profit of 4,500 yuan, and brought back 2,000 yuan in advance payment. With sales channels and capital, sideline production quickly got underway. Starting from August 8th, members engaged in small-scale transportation and sales, boating, and working, earning more than sixty yuan in five days. Various production activities to overcome the famine, such as draining water and replanting late vegetables, were also launched. Fifteen member households who had run out of food received 1,500 catties of relief grain from the government. Nine member households who had no houses to live in were also properly resettled. The members all thanked the village branch for pointing out the direction and leading them forward when disaster struck.

Of course, the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Ximag 각 Village is just an ordinary one among the many village branches in the disaster areas of Hebei Province.

Material Supply Boats
The villages belonging to Ninghe Town had been surrounded by floods for several days, and the villages were waiting for oil, salt, matches, and various raw materials for sideline production. Just as the victims were anxious, Li Yisan, the deputy director of the Ninghe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and four other cooperative cadres appeared with a pair of wooden boats fully loaded with daily necessities and production materials.

On August 9th, the pair of wooden boats arrived at Huzhuang. Li Yisan and others, on behalf of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, expressed their condolences to the victims and helped the village and cooperative cadres calculate how to overcome the famine through production. They supplied the village with 800 catties of reed mats, 10,000 catties of rice straw, and 50,000 catties of mat reeds, as well as fishing tools and daily necessities. All 145 people in the village then launched six types of sideline production, such as making straw bags, weaving mats, fishing, and transportation. When the victims saw the pair of wooden boats, they praised them as life-saving boats.

Li Bazhuang Under Recovery
Li Bazhuang in Qingyuan County is a village where the Tang River and Qingshui River, tributaries of the Daqing River, converge. When the flood peaks of the two rivers arrived on August 2nd, the exceptionally large floods broke through the river embankments and layers of village protection embankments, flowing into the village. More than 7,000 mu of crops in the village were flooded, and 450 of the more than 1,400 houses collapsed. After vigorous rescue efforts, the lives of all 406 member households were saved, but they suffered a loss of 196,000 yuan. The remaining autumn crops could only yield about 10,000 catties of grain.

When the floods began to recede, members of the Huizhong Agricultural Cooperative in Li Bazhuang replanted 300 mu of vegetables in high-lying areas. Now, cabbage and turnips are already a patch of green. All 450 women in the village participated in production such as spinning thread, weaving homespun cloth, weaving mats, and weaving nets. Sixty-six looms and more than 300 spinning wheels were all in operation. The village's twenty-five carts participated in transporting materials to the county's transportation station, earning 130 yuan per day. All men, women, and children in the village are working optimistically and diligently.

After the village received more than 1,000 yuan in relief funds from the government, work to restore their homes began. The agricultural cooperative selected more than twenty skilled laborers to help members repair houses free of charge. More than ten member households have already built forty new houses. Of course, there are still many difficulties in fully recovering. However, Li Rentian, the director of the agricultural cooperative, said with confidence: "Disaster cannot crush our Li Bazhuang."

    灾荒压不倒顽强的人民
    新华社驻河北省记者集体采写
    亲如手足兄弟
    8月6日傍晚，武清县东柳行乡三个农业社的社员们听说永定河套里边一些农业社遭受水灾，立刻组织了包括二十名青壮年的抢险队。当夜，这些小伙子们便在中共乡总支书记张义和的带领下，驾着六只小木船，乘风破浪向水灾村驶去。家里的人们也忙着腾房子、凑柴禾，准备迎接受灾的兄弟。过半夜，抢救队把茨州村的三十九户社员，从洪水包围中接救出来。东柳行乡三个农业社的干部、社员立刻带他们到已经腾出来的二百多间房子里住下来，又给他们送去刚磨好的两千斤面粉和准备好的五千斤柴禾。抢救队还帮助灾民抢运粮食、衣服等，在两天两夜内把能够抢救的财物都抢救出来。东柳行乡三个农业社场边、村边的七十亩空闲地，让这三十九户灾民种上了蔬菜。茨州村的刘大娘流着热泪对东柳行乡的社员们说：我活了多半辈子，只有共产党毛主席的领导，才有这样的好事情，你们待我们真像手足兄弟。
    一个普通的中共村支部
    安次县西麻各庄同建农业社的一千四百八十亩庄稼全部被淹了，全村十分之三的房屋倒塌了，许多社员都愁眉苦脸地低着头。
    灾荒临头，怎么办？中共西麻各庄村支部主持召集支部委员和农业社管理委员开会，盘算可以开展的副业生产，以及副业的收入和生产渡荒的费用。经过大家东找西算，作出了全社的生产渡荒计划。编竹?子、捕鱼、纳鞋底子等七种副业生产开展起来后，三个月的收入就可以供全社三百五十人吃五个月。他们把这个计划告诉给社员们，社员们抬起头来了。村支部立即派人到安次县供销社和北京的有关单位，签订了可以获利四千五百元的竹?子等购销合同，并且带回了两千元预购定金。有了销路，有了本钱，副业生产很快就搞起来。从8月8日开始，社员们搞小本运销、摆船、作工等，五天就挣了六十多元。排水、抢种晚菜等各种生产渡荒活动也开展起来了。十五户绝粮断炊的社员，分得了政府发给一千五百斤救济粮。九户没房住的社员，也得到了妥善的安置。社员们人人感谢村支部在灾难临头的时候给自己指出方向，领导他们前进。
    当然，中共西麻各庄村支部不过是河北省灾区许多村支部中普通的一个。
    物资供应船
    属于宁河镇的各个村庄被洪水包围好几天了，各村都等着油、盐、火柴和各种副业生产原料。正在灾民着急的时候，宁河镇供销社副主任李益三和其他四名社干部驾着一对满装日用百货和生产原料的木船出现了。
    8月9日，这对木船开到了胡庄。李益三等代表供销社向灾民作了慰问，并且帮助村、社干部盘算怎样生产渡荒。他们供给了这村八百斤苇箔，一万斤稻草和五万斤席苇，还有捕鱼工具和生活日用品。全村一百四十五人便开展起打草袋、织席、捕鱼、运输等六种副业生产。这对木船以后又开到孙庄、林庄和其它村庄。灾民们见到这对木船，就称道它们如同救命船。
    恢复中的李八庄
    清苑县李八庄是大清河支流唐河和清水河会流地方的一个村庄。8月2日两河洪峰到来时，特大洪水冲破了河堤和层层的护村埝，流进了村庄。全村七千多亩庄稼都被水淹，一千四百多间房子倒塌了四百五十多间。经过大力抢救，四百零六户社员都保全了生命，但是遭受了十九万六千元的损失。残留下来的秋季作物，也只能收一万来斤粮食。
    洪水开始退落时，李八庄惠众农业社的社员们就在高地抢种了三百亩蔬菜。现在白菜、蔓青已经一片青绿。全村四百五十名妇女参加了纺线、织土布、编席、织网等生产，六十六架织布机、三百多架纺花车都活动起来，村里的二十五辆大车参加到县运输站运输物资，每天可以收入一百三十元。全村男女老少都乐观而辛勤地劳动着。
    这个村得到政府一千多元的救济款后，恢复家园的工作就开始了。农业社抽出二十多名有技术的劳动力，无偿帮助社员修盖房屋。十多户社员已经盖起四十间新房子。当然，完全恢复元气还有很多困难。但是，农业社主任李仁田满有信心地说：“灾荒压不倒我们的李八庄。”
