Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th Dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated at a press conference on August 8th that Britain intends to resolve the Suez Canal issue peacefully with Egypt. However, he also said: This "does not indicate any change in Britain's attitude."

In the room next to where the press conference was held, talks between Britain and France regarding joint naval action to deal with Egypt continued as usual. Meanwhile, according to the Associated Press, the spokesman had privately stated that Britain's "determination to regain control of the Suez Canal has not weakened at all."

The Associated Press said that Britain's expression of willingness to resolve the issue peacefully is because "the Eden government no longer feels it can rely on unilateral military measures to achieve the internationalization of the canal."

It is also reported that the British statement was influenced by Nehru's speech in the People's Assembly on the 8th. Nehru said that the Anglo-French military action had aroused enormous anger throughout Asia.

Agence France-Presse reports pointed out that as Britain accelerates its plan to convene the 24-nation London conference today, the British Foreign Office's expression of willingness to resolve the issue peacefully is seen as an attempt to entice some countries to participate in the London conference. Moreover, it also intends to dispel the attempts of some countries to submit the canal issue to the United Nations.

    企图诱使一些国家参加伦敦会议
    英外交部表示愿同埃及和解
    但又透露英国无意放弃控制苏彝士运河的野心
    新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人八月八日在记者招待会上说，英国打算同埃及和平解决苏彝士运河问题。但是，他又说：这“并不表明英国的态度有所改变”。
    就在举行记者招待会的隔壁房间里，英法关于采取海军联合行动去对付埃及的会谈照常举行。同时，据美联社报道，这个发言人曾经私下表示，英国要重新控制苏彝士运河的“决心一点没有削弱”。
    美联社说，英国之所以表示愿意和平解决问题，是因为“艾登政府已经不再觉得可以靠片面军事措施来实现运河的国际化”。
    还有消息说，英国的声明是受到了尼赫鲁八日在人民院谈话的影响。尼赫鲁说，英法的军事行动，激起了整个亚洲的巨大愤怒。
    法新社消息指出，在今天英国加速推行它的召开二十四国伦敦会议计划的时候，英国外交部的这个愿意和平解决问题的表示，被认为是诱使一些国家来参加伦敦会议的行动。而且，它还打算打消某些国家要把运河问题提交联合国的企图。
