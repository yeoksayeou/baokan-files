Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Beijing has had continuous heavy rain, and the water levels of the Yongding River and other rivers in the suburbs have risen. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Flood Control Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and other units have taken emergency measures to repair houses and prevent floods and waterlogging.
	Yesterday afternoon and night, police officers from the public security stations in various districts of Beijing, cadres from the street offices and the Beijing Real Estate Administration Bureau, and many members of the residents' committees went out in the rain to conduct a general inspection of dangerous houses and carry out rescue and resettlement work. Xidan, Chongwen, Dongdan, Dongsi, and other districts have borrowed school buildings from primary schools in various districts to temporarily resettle residents living in nearby dangerous houses. Dongdan district alone assisted and rescued 278 households.
	To prevent street flooding and dangerous situations caused by rising river water, the Maintenance and Management Office of the Beijing Municipal Sewerage Engineering Bureau has assigned manpower to key river sections in urban and suburban areas, prepared flood control equipment, and strengthened hydrological observation and information work. A system of sectional responsibility has been adopted on the rivers to inspect and prevent the blockage of sewers or the backflow of river water at any time.
	The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy and relevant districts have sent cadres to the countryside to direct flood control and waterlogging prevention work. Many members of agricultural production cooperatives are repairing river embankments, digging ditches for drainage, and rescuing crops in the rain.
