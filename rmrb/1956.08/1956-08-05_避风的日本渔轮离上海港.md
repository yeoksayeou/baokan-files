Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 4th. The eight Japanese fishing boats, including the "Tokai Maru" and "Kyokuto Maru," which entered Shanghai Port to take shelter from the storm, safely left the port this afternoon.

On the morning of the 1st, when these eight fishing boats approached Shanghai Port from the East China Sea fishing grounds, the vanguard of a strong typhoon had already invaded Shanghai. The Shanghai branch of the China Fisheries Association dispatched ships, braving winds of force eight or above, to guide them into the harbor to drop anchor. Thereafter, the wind grew stronger and stronger, with waves on the Huangpu River rising more than one meter high. After being re-moored, the eight fishing boats were designated to be tied to the most solid and secure Minsheng Road Wharf in Shanghai Port.

During these three days, the Shanghai branch of the China Fisheries Association sent people to the boats to express their concern and purchased needed fuel, ice, non-staple foods, and daily necessities for them. After the typhoon warning was lifted, they also treated the crew members to a tour of the Shanghai urban area.

    避风的日本渔轮离上海港
    据新华社上海4日电　驶进上海港避风的日本东海丸、极东丸等八艘渔船已在今天下午安全离港。
    一日上午，这八艘渔船从东海渔场驶近上海港的时候，强台风前哨已经侵入上海。中国渔业协会上海市分会派出船只，冒八级以上大风，把它们引进港内抛锚。这以后，风力越来越强，黄浦江水浪卷起一公尺多高，八艘渔船经过移泊，被指定系缆在上海港最牢固、安全的民生路码头上。
    在这三天多里，中国渔业协会上海市分会曾经派人到船上慰问，为他们购买了需要的燃料、冰、副食品和日用品，并且在台风警报解除后招待船员们游览了上海市区。
