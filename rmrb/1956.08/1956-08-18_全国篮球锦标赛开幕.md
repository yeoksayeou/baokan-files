Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 17th: The 1956 National Basketball Championship began today in Zhengzhou.

    Participating in this championship are twenty men's and women's basketball teams from fourteen cities. These are the men's and women's basketball teams that won the championship or runner-up titles in the Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Nanchang competition zones of the National Basketball Championship for Large and Medium Cities last year. There are more than 250 male and female athletes.

    The competition will adopt a single round-robin system, with each men's and women's team playing against the other nine men's and women's teams respectively. A total of ninety games will be played. Due to the hot weather, the games will be held simultaneously at night on five floodlit courts.

    During the competition, the Championship Organizing Committee will improve the basketball skills of the teams and the level of the referees through observation, seminars, and reports. Through this competition, the ranking of basketball players will also be assessed for the first time.
