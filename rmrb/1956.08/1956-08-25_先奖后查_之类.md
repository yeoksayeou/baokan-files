The like of “Award First, Investigate Later”
		Wu Lü

The Lanzhou East Station of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau awarded bonuses to a group of people who made rationalization proposals, and also held a meeting to encourage them, calling on everyone to continue to make rationalization proposals in the future. It seems that they attach great importance to the work of rationalization proposals.

However, this is just "it seems." The bonus was given, the encouragement was given, and the call was made, and that was the end of the matter. Comrade Wang Dawen of the Freight Office created a "shipping date calculator" and received a bonus of twenty yuan, but it has not been heard that this tool will be adopted. Moreover, even the trial-produced model cannot be found. After a lot of effort, it was found, but only a wreckage remained.

Why is there such enthusiasm for rewarding, but instead a passive attitude towards truly adopting rationalization proposals? It turns out that Lanzhou East Station has never attached importance to employees' rationalization proposals, and many rationalization proposals have been lost. After the wind of opposing right-leaning conservatism spread, the masses had many opinions, and the leadership was in a flurry. In order to quell public resentment, it was decided to "award first, investigate later."

"Award first, investigate later" is indeed a brilliant idea. Isn't it a sign of great importance to rationalization proposals to give bonuses, hold meetings to encourage, and make calls? It's just that rewarding without investigating, or rewarding but not investigating, or rewarding and investigating but not finding anything, let alone adopting rationalization proposals, what is the meaning of this "award"?

To put it bluntly, this "award first, investigate later" is just to decorate the facade in the midst of opposing right-leaning conservatism, to perfunctorily deal with superiors and the masses. Of course, there will not be many places that propose the method of "award first, investigate later" to do the work of rationalization proposals; Lanzhou East Station has also made an inspection after receiving the readers' letter of criticism about this matter forwarded by this newspaper, and there is no need to add more comments here. However, there are still quite a few things similar to this, such as listening to the wind, observing the situation, decorating the facade, and perfunctorily dealing with superiors and the masses. For example, if the superiors emphasize safe production and the workers criticize "the Party Committee has never held a meeting to discuss safety issues," then hold a meeting to discuss safety issues; if the superiors emphasize caring about the hardships of employees and the workers criticize "the leading cadres have never visited the homes of workers," then go to visit once; if the superiors emphasize going deep into production and the workers criticize "the factory director never goes to the workshop," then go to the workshop for a walk. And so on, these are not uncommon things. It cannot be said that these are all to decorate the facade and perfunctorily deal with superiors and the masses, and there is indeed a serious implementation of the instructions of superiors and a sincere acceptance of the criticism of the masses; but there are indeed some that are just to decorate the facade and perfunctorily deal with superiors and the masses.

Paying attention to rewards is certainly good, but giving a reward does not mean adopting a rationalization proposal; holding a meeting to study safety issues is also good, but holding a meeting does not mean solving the problem of safe production; visiting the homes of workers is worth promoting, but visiting does not mean that the hardships of employees are relieved; going to the workshop is the same, going to the workshop does not mean going deep into production. If you really want to do a good job, the methods of "award first, investigate later" and other ways of decorating the facade and perfunctorily dealing with superiors and the masses must be discarded.

### “先奖后查”之类

    “先奖后查”之类
    吴滤
    兰州铁路管理局兰州东站给一批提合理化建议的人发了奖金，还开会鼓励了一番，号召大家今后要继续多多提合理化建议，看来是很重视合理化建议工作的。
    不过，这只是“看来”而已。奖金发了，鼓励过了，号召过了，事情也就完了。货运室王大文同志创造了“运送日期速算器”，得了二十元奖金，却一直没有听说要采用这个工具，而且连试制的模型也找不到，好容易找出来，已经只剩下一付残骸了。
    为什么热心于奖励，对真正采纳合理化建议反而消极了呢？原来兰州东站素来不重视职工的合理化建议，许多合理化建议已不知去向。反对右倾保守的风声传到后，群众意见纷纷，领导手忙脚乱，为了平息民愤，就决定“先奖后查”。
    “先奖后查”，主意确实很妙。既发奖金，又有开会鼓励，还加号召，岂不是很重视合理化建议了吗？只是未查就奖，奖而不查，或者奖而虽查，却查不出名堂，更不要说是采纳合理化建议了，这“奖”又有什么意义呢？
    揭穿了说，这“先奖后查”，就是在反对右倾保守声中装饰装饰门面，应付应付上级和群众而已。提出“先奖后查”的办法来做合理化建议工作的地方，当然不会很多；兰州东站在接到本报转去的读者对这件事的批评信之后，也已作了检查，这里无须多加评论。但是，类似这种听风声，看颜色，装饰装饰门面，应付应付上级和群众的事情，却还不少。比如上级强调安全生产，工人批评“党委会从来没有开过一次会讨论安全问题”，那么，就开一次会讨论安全问题；上级强调关心职工疾苦，工人批评“领导干部从来没有到工人家里访问过”，那么，就去访问一次；上级强调深入生产，工人批评“厂长从来不下车间”，那么，就到车间去走一趟。如此等等，都不是少见的事。不能说这些都是为了装饰装饰门面，应付上级和群众，里面确实有认真贯彻上级指示，虚心接受群众批评的；但也确实有只是为了装饰装饰门面，应付应付上级和群众的。
    注意奖励，当然很好，但发了奖并不就等于采纳了合理化建议；开会研究安全问题，也是好的，但开了会并不等于解决了安全生产的问题；到工人家里去访问，值得提倡，但访问了并不等于职工疾苦就解除了；下车间也是一样，下了车间并不等于就深入了生产。要是真想把工作做好，“先奖后查”之类装饰装饰门面，应付应付上级和群众的办法是要丢掉才行的。
