    Shandong Basically Completes Resettlement of 400,000 Demobilized Soldiers
    (Our Dispatch) Since 1950, Shandong Province has properly resettled over 400,000 demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns, and they have become a powerful force in the current construction of socialism. Over 95% of the demobilized soldiers who returned to the countryside have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 40% of them have been selected as grassroots cadres in villages and cooperatives. 36,432 of them are serving as chairmen of agricultural producers' cooperatives. In Zhu Guantun Village, Mi Zhen District, De County, the eight demobilized soldiers who returned this year set an example in the cooperative, relied on the masses, and actively took the lead in production, gaining the trust and support of the masses. Seven of them have now been elected as cooperative chairmen, committee members, and production team leaders. In the first half of this year, over 11,000 demobilized soldiers were introduced to work in state organs, factories, mines, and other units across the province. According to surveys, over 90% of them are working actively. Of the 47 demobilized soldiers assigned to Jinan Timber Company, 15 have now been named advanced workers.
    Currently, Shandong is understanding the situation with various business departments and registering the details to tap the potential of demobilized soldiers working in local areas. Employment is arranged according to the specialties of the demobilized soldiers, so that those returning home can immediately find work. (Hu Ping)

    山东四十万复员军人基本上安置就绪
    本报讯　自1950年以来，山东省回乡的四十余万复员军人基本上都得到妥善安置，他们已成为当前建设社会主义的一支强大力量。回到农村去的复员军人，95％以上都加入了农业生产合作社，其中又有40％的人被选为乡村、社的基层干部。单是担任农业合作社社长的就有36，432人。德县糜镇区朱官屯村今年回来的八名复员军人，在社里以身作则，依靠群众，在生产中积极带头，取得了群众的信任和拥护，现在已有七人被推选为社长、社委和生产大队长。今年上半年，全省介绍到国家机关、厂矿企业等单位工作的一万一千多名复员军人，据调查有90％以上的人工作是积极的，分配到济南市木材公司的四十七名复员军人，现在已有十五名被评为先进工作者。
    目前，山东各地为了发挥复员军人在地方上工作的潜力，先向各个业务部门了解情况，进行登记，然后根据复员军人的特长安置就业，这样使回乡的复员军人马上就能找到工作。　（胡平）
