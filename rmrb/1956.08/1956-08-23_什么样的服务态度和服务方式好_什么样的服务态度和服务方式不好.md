    Repairing Shoes in the Countryside

    The Panshi Town Shoe Repair Cooperative in Jilin Province, during the busy farming season, formed three mobile shoe repair teams. They wore red and black armbands with the words "Panshi Town Shoe Repair Cooperative Mobile Service Personnel" and carried letters of introduction from the cooperative. They also carried tools such as small presses, shoe lasts, hammers, and scissors, and went to various agricultural cooperatives to repair old shoes for the farmers. These mobile shoe repair teams were warmly welcomed by the agricultural cooperatives. The members happily said, "This is truly a benefit of collectivization. The shoe repairers never used to come to the countryside, but this time, during the busy farming season, they came to repair our shoes." In April, the three mobile teams repaired more than 330 pairs of old shoes for the farmers in just over twenty days, earning more than 124 yuan in repair fees. Some farmers who did not have cash offered chickens or old rubber shoe soles that could be used for repairs as payment.

    Based on the needs of the farmers, the mobile shoe repair teams also bought more than 1,200 pairs of old rubber and leather shoes sold by urban workers. After patching, soling, and nailing them, they sold more than 800 pairs to the farmers at very low prices. These practices were very popular with the farmers.

    Why Did They Stop Delivering Coal?

    In the past, when the local supply and marketing cooperative supplied coal to the residents of Chengguan Town, Liangxiang County, Hebei Province, it delivered the coal to the users' homes. However, since the supply and marketing cooperative transferred the business of supplying coal to the Liangxiang County Coal Industry Building Materials Company this summer, this method of delivering coal to households has been canceled. Now, residents must go to great lengths to find a porter every time they buy coal. At the same time, the Coal Industry Building Materials Company also stipulates that payment must be made and coal picked up on the same day, otherwise the coal cannot be taken.

    People are very surprised: these staff members of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company used to work in the supply and marketing cooperative. Why, after this transfer, did they cancel the methods that were popular with the masses?

      Touched by the People's Liberation Army

    One day, when the Shanghai Food Company's First Store was busy, saleswoman Zhang Huiying saw a naval soldier struggling to squeeze to the bread counter, carrying many things on his back and in his arms, and also carrying a luggage roll. Zhang Huiying immediately bought the bread for the naval soldier, found a cardboard box to pack the scattered items he was carrying, took them to the door, and hired a pedicab for him. After returning to his unit, the People's Liberation Army soldier wrote a letter to Zhang Huiying saying, "I want to learn from your spirit of serving the people and strive to liberate Taiwan."

        Difficult to Eat

    One Sunday noon, I played in Beihai Park in Beijing for a while and felt hungry. I really wanted to find a restaurant to eat. I ran from this street to that street, but every restaurant was full and there was no room. Later, I walked to Xisi and saw a restaurant from afar. I thought I could have a hearty meal, but when I got closer, I saw a blackboard hanging at the door with two large characters written on it: "Closed." I wanted to find another restaurant, but an "old Beijinger" told us: "Don't bother, Beijing restaurants are closed from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM." It turned out that by running around like this, I had missed the lunch hour and had to wait until dinner.

    Beijing's Breakfast Variety is Too Limited

    After learning about some of the service methods welcomed by customers in Shanghai from the newspaper, it occurred to me that in Beijing, on the one hand, it is necessary to quickly increase the number of service industries and expand the scope of services; on the other hand, Beijing's existing service industries should also think of more ways to better meet the needs of Beijing citizens on the existing basis. Taking breakfast as an example, Shanghai has countless varieties, such as glutinous rice balls, gluten noodles, pan-fried buns, beef soup, fine noodle soup... etc. But in Beijing, in the morning, it's just sesame cakes. Why always let Beijing residents eat sesame cakes?

    下乡修鞋
    吉林省磐石镇修鞋合作社在农忙期间，组成了三个下乡游动修鞋小组，带着“磐石镇修鞋合作社流动服务员”的红色黑字的袖标，拿着本社的介绍信，背着小压刀、鞋模子、锤子、剪子等工具，到各农业社为农民修补旧鞋。这些修鞋游动小组受到农业社的热诚欢迎，社员们高兴地说：“这真是合作化带来的好处，掌鞋的从来没下过乡，这回正在农忙的时候，也下乡来给我们修理鞋了。”四月份三个游动小组，下乡二十来天就为农民修理了三百三十多双旧鞋，收入修理费一百二十四元多。有的农民修鞋没有现款，就拿鸡子和修鞋能用的旧胶鞋底来顶修理费。
    游动修鞋小组根据农民的需要还买来城市职工卖掉的旧胶鞋、皮鞋一千二百多双，经过贴补、打掌、打钉后，用很便宜的价格卖给农民八百多双，这些做法很受农民欢迎。

    为什么不给送煤了
    河北省良乡县城关镇居民的用煤，原来由当地供销社供应的时候，是把煤送到各用户家里的。但是，自从今年夏天供销社将供应煤的业务移交给良乡县煤业建筑器材公司后，这种送煤到户的办法被取消了。现在，住户买一次煤，必须花很大功夫先去找拉脚的。同时，煤建公司还规定，当天付款，当天取煤，否则便不能取煤了。
    人们都很奇怪：煤建公司的这些工作人员，原来都是在供销社工作的，为什么这一移交，就把原来受群众欢迎的办法取消了？

      感动了解放军
    一天，上海市食品公司第一商店营业正忙的时候，营业员张慧英看见一个海军战士身上背着、手里抱着许多东西，还带着一个行李卷，艰难地挤到面包柜前来买面包。张慧英便马上替这个海军战士买好面包，并且找了一个纸箱，替他把手里拿的那些零星东西装好，送到门口，还代他雇了一辆三轮车。这位解放军回到部队后，给张慧英写来一封信说：“我要学习你这种为人民服务的精神，为解放台湾而奋斗。”

        吃　饭　难
    一个星期日的中午，我在北京北海公园玩了会，肚子饿了，很想找一家饭馆吃饭，从这条街跑到那条街，家家都是客满，无法插脚。后来又走到西四，老远就看见一家饭铺，满以为可以痛痛快快地吃顿饭了，那知走近一看，门口挂着一块黑板，上面写着两个大字：“休息”。我还想再去找，一位“老北京”对我们说：“甭了，北京饭铺都是下午两点到四点休息。”原来我这样一跑，已经错过吃午饭的钟点，只好等到吃晚饭了。

    北京的早点花样太少
    在报纸上了解到上海一些受到顾客欢迎的服务方式，使我想到：在北京，一方面需要迅速增加服务性行业的数量，扩大服务范围；一方面，北京原有的服务业，也应多想办法，使北京市民的生活需要能在现有的基础上得到更好的满足。即以早点来说，上海有数不清的花样品种，如粢饭团、百叶面筋、生煎馒头、牛肉汤、细粉汤……等等，而北京呢，在早上，除了烧饼，还是烧饼，为什么老是让北京居民吃烧饼呢？
