Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 9th: Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil told a reporter from the "Sudan News" on August 8th that the Western countries' insistence that Egypt is incapable of managing the Suez Canal is without any basis. He said that facts can be waited upon to prove whether this "assumption" of Western countries is justified.

Khalil also said: "Our responsibility is to support what is right. After considering this issue, we have reached this conclusion: Egypt's nationalization of the canal is within the scope of its sovereignty." He said that Sudan's "firm neutral policy" has not changed as a result of the events of the past few weeks.

    西方国家诬蔑埃及无力管理运河是没有根据的
    苏丹总理指出埃及有权把运河收归国有
    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：苏丹总理哈利尔八月八日对“苏丹新闻”报记者发表谈话说，西方国家硬说埃及没有能力管理苏彝士运河是没有任何根据的。他说，可以等事实来证明西方国家的这种“假想”是否有根据。
    哈利尔还说：“我们的责任是赞成正确的事。对这个问题进行考虑以后，我们已经得出了这种结论：埃及把运河收归国有是它主权范围以内的事。”他说，苏丹采取的“坚定的中立政策”，决没有因为过去几星期的事件而有所改变。
