Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 11th - The Polish government has issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Polish government considers the act of nationalizing the Suez Canal to be a decision stemming from the undeniable sovereignty of the Republic of Egypt. Therefore, the actions taken by the three Western governments must be regarded as an inadmissible attempt to exert pressure on a country exercising its sovereignty, and an attempt to violate Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all member states shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force. This action has already exacerbated the tense situation in the Middle East.

It is clear that the nationalization of the privately owned Suez Canal Company does not in any way hinder the freedom of navigation through the canal.

Moreover, it is well known that the guarantees given by the Egyptian government fully safeguard the freedom of navigation stipulated in Article 1 of the 1888 Convention, and that since the nationalization of the canal, navigation through the canal has been smooth and unimpeded.

Regarding the proposal by the three countries to convene a meeting in London, the Polish government has always believed that all international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means. Therefore, it believes that the United Nations is the appropriate forum for discussing issues related to freedom of navigation.

However, if the parties concerned agree to hold a special conference, the Polish government believes that the participation of all relevant countries should be ensured, and not just a randomly selected group of countries, as suggested by the three countries.

However, the Polish government believes that such a conference has no right to discuss or question the nationalization of the Suez Canal, as this action was taken on the basis of a perfectly valid decision by the government of the Republic of Egypt. To do so would be tantamount to an inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.

The People's Republic of Poland is a maritime nation with many large-tonnage ships navigating the Suez Canal, and therefore it is fully qualified to participate in such a conference.

The Polish government expresses its surprise at the failure to include Poland among the proposed participating countries.

The Polish government reserves its opinion on the nature and composition of the London conference proposed by the three countries. The Polish government believes that it is appropriate to allow Poland to participate in this conference on the same footing as all other relevant countries.

    波兰政府就苏彝士运河问题发表声明
    支持埃及政府维护主权的行动
    认为波兰完全有资格参加伦敦会议
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰政府发表了关于苏彝士运河问题的声明。声明全文如下：
    波兰政府认为把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动是出自埃及共和国的不容否认的主权的决定。因此必须认为西方三国政府采取的行动是企图对一个行使主权的国家施加压力的不能容许的尝试，是违背联合国宪章第二条第四款的尝试，这一款规定各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力。这个行动已经加剧了中东的紧张局势。
    很明显，把私有财产苏彝士运河公司收归国有根本不妨碍运河通航的自由。
    而且大家知道，埃及政府给予的保证完全保障了1888年公约第一条规定的航行自由，并且自从运河国有化以来，运河的航行一直畅通无阻。
    关于三国在伦敦召开会议的建议，波兰政府始终认为一切国际争端应当用和平方法解决，因此它认为，联合国是讨论与通航自由有关的问题的适当的讲坛。
    但是，如果有关方面同意举行一次特别会议，波兰政府认为应该保证所有有关国家的参加，而不仅仅是随便选择出来的一些国家参加，像三国建议所建议的那样。
    但是，波兰政府认为，这样一个会议决没有资格讨论或质问苏彝士运河国有化的行动，因为这个行动是根据埃及共和国政府的完全有效的决定采取的。如果这样做，就等于对一个主权国的内政进行了不能允许的干涉。
    波兰人民共和国是一个海运国，它有许多吨位很大的船只在苏彝士运河航行，因此它完全有资格参加这样一个会议。
    波兰政府对于未能把波兰列入建议中的与会国之列表示惊讶。
    波兰政府保留它对三国建议的伦敦会议的性质和成员的意见，波兰政府认为让波兰根据所有其他有关国家的同等权利参加这个会议是适当的。
