Such a "Scientific" View
	Jin Xiulong

Some people often say things like "That's not scientific" or "scientific" on a daily basis, but they have never seriously thought about what "science" is. For example, when a traditional Chinese medicine doctor writes a prescription, writing "Bupleurum falcatum five qian," "white peony three qian," or "Ophiopogon japonicus one liang," etc., but because they don't use a thermometer to measure body temperature, a stethoscope to check the pulse, or even wear a white coat, they think it's "unscientific and backward"! They rarely think about the therapeutic effects.

Logically speaking, the therapeutic effect is the standard for checking the scientific validity of medical treatment.

Regarding art, we have also been saying that singing has the science of vocalization; painting has the science of form; acting has the science of performance. But regarding what the science of vocalization, the science of form, and the science of performance are, people think about it just as little, or even don't think about it at all. The reason why they don't think about it much is because these things seem to have been concluded. For example, in drama, the Stanislavski system is science, and science is the Stanislavski system. Is there any need to think about it?

But things don't just let us off the hook because we don't think about them. The performances of Du Jinfang, Ye Sheng’lan, and others caused a sensation in Paris and all of Europe. Mei Lanfang has long been a world-renowned great artist. Qi Baishi's paintings are acclaimed at home and abroad. Some Soviet dramatists are greatly interested in our current methods of training opera actors. How can these be explained? Could it be that the performances of Mei Lanfang and others completely conform to the Stanislavski system, and Qi Baishi completely inherited Da Vinci or Raphael? Where is the complexity of the science of art?

If we are not arbitrary and truly want to talk about science, we must listen to the opinions of these great artists. Science cannot deny facts.

It seems that we have the right to doubt the following logic today:

--Artistic training should be based on science (we also agree on this point).
--What is science?
--Foreign things.

Simply put, the currently popular view of "science" is like this. Doubting certain things from foreign countries is doubting science! Doubting certain statements in the Stanislavski system is violating the socialist realism method of drama!

God knows whether this is promoting science or promoting superstition! In terms of film production methods, we are now much more "scientific," with bureaus and studios, each performing its own functions, and the equipment and systems can be said to be the most modern. But the output is low, and there are few good films! Isn’t this really holding a golden bowl and begging for food—the method is scientific, but the result is not good!

Isn’t it necessary to doubt such a "scientific" view?

    如此“科学”观
    金绣龙
    有些人平日虽也常说：“这不科学”或“科学”，但关于什么是“科学”，却从来没有认真想过。比如中医开药方，写着“柴胡五钱”、“白芍三钱”或“地冬一两”等等，但因为他不是用体温表量体温、用听诊器检查脉膊，甚至没有穿白衣服，便以为这“不科学，落后”！至于医疗效果方面的事，却很少想。
    照理说，疗效是检查医疗的科学性的标准。
    关于艺术，我们也一直在说，唱歌，有发声的科学；画画，有造型的科学；演戏，有表演的科学。但关于什么是发声的科学、造型的科学和表演的科学，同样地想的不多，甚至不去想。其所以不多想，便是因为这些似乎都有定论了。比如演剧，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系就是科学，科学就是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系。这还用得着想么？
    但事情并不因为不去想，就和我们善罢干休。杜近芳、叶盛兰等人的表演轰动了巴黎和全欧洲，梅兰芳许久以来就是举世公认的大艺术家。齐白石的画载誉中外。苏联的某些戏剧家对于我们今天训练戏曲演员的方法感到莫大兴味。这些怎么解释？难道梅兰芳等人的表演完全符合斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，而齐白石，则完全继承了达·芬奇或拉费尔？艺术科学的复杂性到那里去了？
    如果并不武断，真正要讲科学，就不能不听听这些大艺术家们的意见。科学不能不承认事实。
    看起来，我们今天有权利来怀疑这样的逻辑：
    ——应该把艺术训练建立在科学的基础上（关于这点，我们也赞成）。
    ——什么是科学呢？
    ——外国的。
    简单说来，目前流行的“科学”观就是如此。怀疑了外国的某些东西，就是怀疑科学！怀疑了斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系中的某些说法，就是违反了社会主义现实主义的演剧方法！
    天晓得这是在提倡科学，还是在提倡迷信！从电影的制片方法说，我们现在是“科学”多了，有局有厂，各司其职，而且装备与制度，都可说是最新式的。但就是出片少，而且是好片少！这岂不真是捧着金碗讨饭——方法是科学的，结果却不佳！
    难道不需要来怀疑一下这样的“科学”观么？
