Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: In mid-to-late July, female athletes from the Soviet Union and European People's Democratic countries set a batch of new world records.

On July 29th in Rostock, the women's relay team of the German Democratic Republic broke the world records for both the 4x440-yard relay and the 4x880-yard relay in a single day. Their time for the 440-yard relay was 45.8 seconds, faster than the official world record of 46.3 seconds held by Australia. Their time for the 880-yard relay was 1 minute 36.4 seconds, half a second faster than the world record created by the British team in 1953.

On July 14th, during the Romanian Olympic team selection trials held in Bucharest, Iolanda Balas broke the world record held by Britain's Hopkins (1 meter 74 centimeters) with a high jump of 1 meter 75 centimeters.
