Farmers Everywhere Thank the PLA for their Support

(Our dispatch) In the past week, various organizations, agricultural production cooperatives, and rural work comrades have written to the "People's Liberation Army Daily," expressing their gratitude to the local garrison troops for their enthusiastic support in summer hoeing, summer harvesting, drought resistance, and flood prevention, and reporting the good news of a promising harvest.

The letter from the Red Star Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Taihe Township, Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, stated: "This spring, when we were reclaiming paddy fields, we lacked manpower. More than 400 comrades from the troops came to help us dig the main canal of the irrigation ditch. During the spring plowing, the troops also timely sent eight mules, three double-wheel double-share plows, and other agricultural implements to support our spring plowing. Because the land was plowed deeply, the seedlings grew vigorously, and a good harvest is in sight this year."

Comrade Kexun from Aksu, Xinjiang, wrote: "The troops in the Aksu reclamation area help farmers train technical cadres, provide high-quality seeds at low prices, donate agricultural implements, and treat livestock, which has boosted farmers' confidence in increasing production." The director of the Xin Ke Agricultural Cooperative in Shule County said: "Our biggest difficulty is not understanding advanced agricultural science and technology. Now, with the help of the troops, we will definitely be able to increase production this year."

Comrade Lan Tiansheng from Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, wrote: "When a severe drought threatened spring plowing, more than 100 officers and soldiers from a certain unit came to Gutang'ao Cooperative No. 1 with their tents to help dig wells and open ditches, and divert water to irrigate the fields. They worked hard for three days and nights, solving the water source problem for more than 70 mu of paddy fields, and also helped transplant rice seedlings on 140 mu. Now the early rice has had a bumper harvest, with an increase of 55.5% compared to last year, and the income of all cooperative members will increase. The cooperative members remember the source of the water with gratitude, and everyone says, 'We should thank the PLA for their help!'"

    各地农民感谢解放军的支援
    本报讯　一周来，各地机关、农业生产合作社和农村工作同志纷纷给“解放军报”写信，感谢当地驻军在夏锄、夏收、抗旱、防涝中的热情支援，并且报告了丰收在望的喜讯。
    辽宁省辽阳市太河乡红星高级农业社的来信中说：今春，我们开垦水田的时候，人力不足，四百多位部队同志来帮助我们挖水渠的总干线；春耕时，部队又适时地送来了八匹骡马、三台双轮双铧犁和其他农具，支援我们春耕。由于地翻得深，苗就长得茁壮，今年丰收已经在望。
    新疆阿克苏地方的克迅同志来信说：阿克苏垦区部队帮助农民训练技术干部、廉价供应优良种子、赠送农具、医治牲口，鼓舞了农民增产的信心。疏勒县新克农业社主任说：“我们最大的困难是不懂先进的农业科学技术，现在有了部队同志的帮助，今年一定能够增产。”
    广东省惠阳县的蓝天胜同志来信说：在旱灾严重威胁春耕的时候，某部队一百多名官兵带着营幕来到古塘坳一社，帮助打井开圳、引水灌田，紧张地突击了三昼夜，解决了七十多亩稻田的水源，还协助插秧一百四十亩。现在早稻已丰收，比去年增产55.5％，全体社员的收入都将有增加。社员们饮水思源，人人都说：“应该感谢解放军的帮助！”
