Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 17th - The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in coordination with the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, has concluded its investigation into the elderly people in the Wuhan area who participated in the first uprising of the Xinhai Revolution. It has now been determined that, in addition to those who are already employed, there are 636 elderly people scattered throughout the city, with the largest number residing in the Wuchang District, the site of the uprising.

As early as the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, they successively joined the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, they were young officers, soldiers, or civil servants in the revolutionary war to overthrow the former Qing feudal dynasty. Now, these people have become white-haired old men aged sixty to eighty-six.

In the years since liberation, the People's Government has consistently cared for these elderly people, providing emergency relief, long-term relief, or temporary relief to those with financial difficulties, according to their individual circumstances.

The elderly people are very grateful for this investigation and the government's care and relief over the years. Many were moved to tears. They said: Since the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we, these old people without status, have been ignored. We are extremely grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government for their care for us.

    参加辛亥革命的老人
    得到人民政府关怀
    据新华社武汉17日电　政协湖北省委员会协同中国国民党革命委员会湖北省、武汉市地方组织在武汉地区调查参加辛亥革命首次起义老人的工作，目前已告结束。现在查明，当时参加起义的老人除已参加工作的人以外，还有636人散居在全市，其中以住在起义地点——武昌区的人数最多。
    远在1911年10月10日武昌起义时起，他们就相继参加了辛亥革命。他们当时都是推翻前清封建王朝革命战争中的年青官兵或文职人员。现在，这些人都成了白发苍苍的六十到八十六岁的老人了。
    解放后几年来，人民政府一贯关怀这些老人，对其中生活有困难的，都分别情况给予了急救、长年救济或临时救济。
    老人们对这次调查和政府多年来的关怀、救济，甚为感激。不少人感动得流了泪。他们说：从孙中山先生逝世以后，我们这些没有地位的老人无人过问，我们万分感激共产党和人民政府对我们的关怀。
