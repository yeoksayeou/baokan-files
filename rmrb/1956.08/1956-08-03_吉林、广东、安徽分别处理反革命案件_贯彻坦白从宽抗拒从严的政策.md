Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 2nd -- The Liaoyuan City People's Procuratorate of Jilin Province announced at a meeting of 25,000 people on July 31st that it would give lenient treatment to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang secret agent Yang Chengcai, who had confessed his crimes and showed genuine repentance and meritorious service. He was exempted from prosecution and given material rewards and employment opportunities based on his meritorious performance.

Before the national liberation, Yang Chengcai served in the Northeast as the head of the organization and training group of a Kuomintang county party headquarters and as an adjutant of the Liaoyang Armed Work Team. After the liberation of the Northeast, he fled to Qingdao and joined the Kuomintang army, where he served as deputy instructor of a company, staff officer of a regimental political department, and member of a division party headquarters, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. When the country was liberated, he fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang army. In April 1953, he was admitted to the "(Taiwan) Shipai Special Agent Training Class" (publicly known as the "General Political Department Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense") for a year of training. There, Yang Chengcai learned so-called all-round secret agent skills such as collecting intelligence, inciting defections, action and demolition, armed guerrilla warfare, psychological warfare, as well as social occupations for traffic liaison, secret writing, sending and receiving telegrams, photography, parachuting, and cover for secret agent activities. Shortly after graduating from this training class, Yang Chengcai was assigned by the Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization "Central Committee Second Group" as the "Station Chief of the Jiliao Border Area Work Station" in Northeast China, with the main task of developing Kuomintang underground organizations and gathering military and political intelligence of our side. In September 1955, Yang Chengcai sneaked into the mainland via Hong Kong. He had just returned home to Liaoyuan City when he encountered the vigorous Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign. The people sharpened their eyes and reported hidden counter-revolutionaries, and he was temporarily unable to carry out his secret agent activities according to the original plan, and was extremely hesitant and distressed. Just as he calmed down to reconsider his plan of action, the residents' group asked him to participate in meetings to discuss the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the sentencing rally for counter-revolutionaries. In these activities, he began to realize the people's government's policy of "combining suppression with leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries. Later, he watched the movie "Caught in the Net," realized the high vigilance of the people and public security organs, and became very nervous, feeling that he had also fallen into the net. From then on, he became more and more panicked and wavering, to the point where he could not sleep, could not eat, and suffered from neurasthenia and stomach problems.

In the half year or so since Yang Chengcai returned home, he saw that his old mother and his younger brother, who worked as a miner, and their family not only had food and clothing, but also enjoyed national labor insurance benefits and lived a happy life. His brother often told him about the country's large-scale construction, which gradually enabled him to calmly observe the new society in contrast to the deceptive propaganda of the Kuomintang secret service. Later, he also confirmed the people's government's lenient policy and realistic approach towards counter-revolutionaries who confessed their crimes from an old man named Lao Yang, who often attended hearings of cases in the local people's court. All of this made him begin to feel that there was no future in persisting in secret agent sabotage activities.

Although Yang Chengcai had written three liaison letters to the Kuomintang secret service leader in Hong Kong and received one reply after returning to the mainland, he finally embarked on the correct path of confessing and surrendering under the call of the people's government's lenient policy and with the help of his neighbors and relatives. On April 5, 1956, he dispelled all kinds of ideological concerns and surrendered to the Liaoyuan City Public Security Bureau of Jilin Province, confessed his crimes, and made accusations. After investigation by the people's government, it was confirmed that Yang Chengcai had indeed sincerely confessed his crimes and had performed meritorious service.

After receiving lenient treatment of exemption from prosecution, Yang Chengcai gratefully stated: I thank the people's government for giving me lenient treatment. I will definitely reform myself in the future and dedicate all my remaining strength to the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan and the socialist construction of the motherland.

The special agent who carried out the bombing activity on "May Day" was sentenced to death
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd -- The counter-revolutionary criminal Liu Li, who bombed the Shenzhen railway tracks in Guangdong Province on the evening of "May Day" this year, was arrested by our public security personnel within a month after the incident. The Bao'an County People's Court held a sentencing rally in Shenzhen Town on the afternoon of July 29th with nearly 4,000 people participating, and read out the death sentence to Liu Li and executed it immediately.

The counter-revolutionary criminal Liu Li (also known as Liu Lifu) joined the "Central Committee Second Group" secret service organization in Hong Kong in September 1953 through the introduction of secret agents Luo Zhiming and Yuan Bao. After receiving training in secret writing and other secret service techniques, he sneaked back to Shenzhen, Zhangmutou, Pinghu, Shawan and other places to collect our military intelligence, and repeatedly sent it to the Chiang gang's secret service in Hong Kong in secret writing. In April 1955, Liu sneaked back to Hong Kong from the mainland and, after a short period of training in explosive technology, was assigned by Chen Jinghui, a special agent of the "Central Committee Second Group" stationed in Hong Kong, to blow up a railway bridge near Shenzhen on the evening of "May Day". After accepting the task, Liu Li used the cunning techniques he had cultivated during the Chiang Kai-shek rule to cross the border illegally. On the evening of April 29, he sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong and blew up a steel rail and a sleeper two kilometers north of Shenzhen Station with a time bomb at 11 p.m. on "May Day" evening. Liu fled back to Hong Kong on the same night after the incident.

Liu was "commended" by the Chiang gang's secret service for this heinous act and received a bonus of 500 Hong Kong dollars.

After realizing this heinous plan, Liu became even more frantic. He then conspired with the secret agent "instructor" surnamed Song, who came from Taiwan to provide Liu with technical guidance on time bombing, to carry out even more vicious sabotage. Before this plan could be realized, Liu suddenly received a new mission from the Chiang gang's secret service. On May 31, he secretly carried four radio parts and sneaked into Shenzhen, and was arrested by our public security organs that day.

A public security officer described the process of Liu's arrest to reporters: As early as the day before Liu bombed the railway, Liu's suspicious activities in Shenzhen had aroused the suspicion of a fellow villager. After the bombing of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway, the public security organs quickly learned of this situation. Based on the materials provided by Liu's fellow villager, the public security organs closely monitored Liu's activities. On May 31, after Liu sneaked back into Shenzhen from Hong Kong again, he was quickly arrested by public security officers in a hotel.

After being arrested, Liu had no choice but to admit all his crimes in the face of irrefutable evidence. The Bao'an County People's Court sentenced Liu to death according to law. Before the execution, Liu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court, requesting lenient treatment for his crimes. After review, the Higher People's Court found that Liu's crimes were serious, the evidence was conclusive, and there were no circumstances that could mitigate his sentence in the entire process. The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court rejected his appeal.

Counter-revolutionary elements who committed murder and resisted arrest were shot dead on the spot
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 2nd -- Wan Yuchang, a counter-revolutionary element in Liuji Township, Fengtai County, Anhui Province, killed and wounded eight family members of our cadres and the masses, and resisted arrest with a knife. He was shot dead on the spot by our public security officers. This incident occurred on the evening of April 12, 1956.

At about 7:30 p.m. that night, the counter-revolutionary element Wan Yuchang took advantage of the opportunity that members of the agricultural production cooperative were going to attend a work point meeting and went to the home of Wang Kezhong, a village people's representative and militia captain, with a knife to commit murder. The murderer met Wang Kezhong's twelve-year-old daughter, Wang Huaiying, on the road and killed her. Then he broke into Wang Kezhong's house and killed Wang Kezhong's mother, wife, son, sister-in-law and four others, and wounded Wang Kezhong's ten-year-old son and sister-in-law. Wan Yupei, a member of the Communist Youth League, rushed to the scene to rescue the victims and was also wounded by the murderer.

After receiving the news, the Fengtai County Public Security Bureau immediately sent people to the scene to arrest him. The counter-revolutionary element Wan Yuchang resisted arrest with a knife and was shot dead on the spot by our public security officers. The injured masses were immediately sent to the County People's Hospital for treatment.

The counter-revolutionary element Wan Yuchang was a habitual bandit. Before liberation, he had worked in the puppet army. After liberation, he often defrauded and stole the property of the masses and trafficked two women. Wang Kezhong worked actively in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, the counter-revolutionary element Wan Yuchang harbored hatred for him and broke into Wang's house with a knife on the evening of April 12, attempting to kill Wang's entire family.

    吉林、广东、安徽分别处理反革命案件
    贯彻坦白从宽抗拒从严的政策
    悔罪立功的特务得到宽大处理
    新华社长春2日电　吉林省辽源市人民检察院七月三十一日在二万五千人的大会上，宣布给坦白了自己罪行并确有悔悟和有立功表现的蒋介石集团特务分子杨成才以宽大处理，对他免予起诉，并根据立功表现给以物质奖励和就业机会。
    杨成才于全国解放前曾经在东北充当国民党一个县党部的组训组长、辽阳武装工作队副官，东北解放后逃去青岛，参加国民党军队，曾任连副指导员、团政治部干事、师党部委员等职务，进行反革命活动。全国解放时随国民党军队逃到台湾，于1953年4月考入“（台湾）石碑特务训练班”（公开名义为“国防部总政治部干部训练班”）受训一年。杨成才在那里学习了收集情报、策反、行动爆破、武装游击、心理作战以及交通连络、密写、收发报、摄影、跳伞以及掩护进行特务活动的社会职业等所谓全能特务技能。杨成才从这个训练班出来不久，就被蒋介石的特务组织“中委会第二组”委派为东北“吉辽边区工作站站长”以发展国民党地下组织、刺探我方军政情报等为主要任务。1955年9月杨成才经香港潜来大陆，他刚回到辽源市家里，正赶上轰轰烈烈的肃反运动，人民群众都擦亮眼睛，检举暗藏的反革命分子，他一时无法按原来计划进行特务活动，就极为傍徨苦恼。当他刚静下心来准备重新考虑活动计划时，居民组却让他参加讨论肃反问题的会议和对反革命分子的宣判大会。在这些活动中他开始认识到人民政府对待反革命分子的“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策。以后他又看了电影“天罗地网”，认识到人民群众和公安机关的高度警惕性，心情非常紧张，感到自己也已落在法网中了。从此，他更加恐慌和动摇，以至睡不着觉，吃不下饭，还害了神经衰弱和肠胃病。
    杨成才回到家里半年多来，看到自己的老母亲和在煤矿当工人的弟弟等一家人不仅有吃有穿，还受到国家劳保待遇，过着幸福的生活。他兄弟还经常告诉他有关国家大规模建设的情况，使他渐渐能对照国民党特务机关的欺骗宣传冷静地观察新社会的事情。以后，他又从一个经常旁听当地人民法院审理案件的老杨头那里证实了人民政府对坦白自新的反革命分子的宽大政策和实事求是的作法。这些都使他开始感到，如果坚持进行特务破坏活动，是没有前途的。
    杨成才回大陆后，虽曾向在香港的国民党特务头子写过三封连络信并收到一封回信，但终于在人民政府宽大政策的感召下和他的邻居及亲友的帮助下，走上了坦白自首的正确道路。1956年4月5日，他打消了种种思想顾虑，向吉林省辽源市公安局自首，坦白了罪行，并进行了检举。经人民政府查实，杨成才确实真诚坦白了自己的罪行，并有立功表现。
    杨成才在受到免予起诉的宽大处理后感激地表示：我感谢人民政府给我宽大处理。今后一定重新作人，把余下的一切力量，献给为解放台湾的斗争和祖国社会主义建设事业。
    “五一”节进行爆破活动的特务被判死刑
    新华社广州2日电　今年“五一”节晚上爆炸广东境内深圳铁路路轨的反革命罪犯刘立，在案件发生后的一个月内，即为我公安人员逮捕归案。宝安县人民法院于七月二十九日下午在深圳镇举行的有近四千人参加的宣判大会上，宣读对刘犯判处死刑的判决书，并立即执行。
    反革命罪犯刘立（又名刘立福）于1953年9月在香港由特务分子罗志明、袁保介绍参加了“中委会第二组”特务组织，经过密写等特务技术训练后，于同年潜回深圳、樟木头、平湖、沙湾等地搜集我军事情报，并先后多次以密写方式寄给蒋帮驻香港的特务机关。1955年4月，刘犯由内地潜返香港，经过短期的爆炸技术训练后，于今年四月由“中委会第二组”驻香港的特务分子陈镜辉，指派他在“五一”节晚到深圳附近爆炸铁路桥梁。刘犯接受任务后，利用他在蒋介石统治时期培养成的偷越边境的狡猾伎俩，即于四月二十九日晚自香港潜来深圳，并在“五一”节晚上十一时以定时炸弹炸断了深圳站以北二公里地方的一根钢轨和一根枕木。事情发生后的当晚，刘犯逃回香港。
    刘犯由于这次罪恶的行动而受到蒋帮特务机关的“表扬”，并且领到五百元港币的奖金。
    刘犯在实现了这个罪恶的计划以后，就更加疯狂了，他接着和那个来自台湾对刘犯进行计时爆破等技术指导的姓宋的特务“教官”计议，准备进行更凶恶的破坏。这个计划还没有实现，刘犯忽然又接受了蒋帮特务机关新的任务，五月三十一日，他秘密携带电台零件四件潜来深圳，结果当天就被我公安机关逮捕了。
    一个公安人员向记者叙述了刘犯落网的经过说：早在刘犯爆炸铁路的前一天，刘犯在深圳的一些可疑活动已经引起了他的一个同乡的怀疑。爆炸广（州）深（圳）铁路案件发生后，公安机关很快就了解到这一情况。根据刘犯的同乡所提供的材料，公安机关密切注意了刘犯的活动。五月三十一日，刘犯自香港再度潜来深圳后，很快就在一个旅店中被公安人员逮捕了。
    刘犯被捕以后，在不容抵赖的各种罪证面前，不得不承认他的全部罪行。宝安县人民法院依法判处刘犯死刑，在执行前，刘犯不服判决，曾向广东省高级人民法院上诉，要求对他的罪行从宽处理。高级人民法院经过复核认为刘犯罪恶重大，证据确凿，而在前后整个过程中又无任何可以减刑宽处的情节，广东省高级人民法院驳回了他的上诉。
    行凶拒捕的反革命分子当场被击毙
    新华社合肥2日电　安徽省凤台县刘集乡反革命分子万玉昌行凶杀死、杀伤我干部家属和群众八人，并且持刀拒捕，当场被我公安人员击毙。这件事发生在1956年4月12日的晚上。
    那天晚七时半左右，反革命分子万玉昌乘农业生产合作社社员们去开记工会的机会，持刀到村人民代表、民兵队长王克中家中行凶。凶犯在路上碰见王克中十二岁的女孩王怀英，即将女孩杀死。随后闯到王克中家里，杀死了王克中的母亲、妻子、儿子、嫂子等四人，并将王克中的十岁男孩和弟媳妇二人杀伤。青年团员万玉佩闻讯赶到现场营救，也被凶犯杀伤。
    凤台县公安局得到消息后，当即派人前往现场逮捕，反革命分子万玉昌竟持刀拒捕，当场被我公安人员击毙。受伤群众立即送县人民医院医治。
    反革命分子万玉昌是一个惯匪，解放前曾在伪军中干过事，解放以后仍经常欺诈盗窃群众财物，并且拐卖过两个妇女。王克中在肃清反革命分子的斗争中工作积极。因此反革命分子万玉昌对他心怀仇恨，就在四月十二日晚乘王克中去开会的机会，持刀闯入王家，企图杀死王克中全家。
