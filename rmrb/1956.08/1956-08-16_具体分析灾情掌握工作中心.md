Local Newspaper Commentary

    The Zhejiang Daily published a report on August 10th regarding the resumption of production in the Ningbo Special District after suffering from typhoon damage, stating: Because the Party Committee timely and realistically analyzed the disaster situation, grasped the central task, and comprehensively strengthened leadership over all production activities, the work of resuming production in this special district has progressed rapidly. On the same day, the newspaper also published a commentary entitled "Analyzing the Disaster Situation, Strengthening Comprehensive Leadership over Production."
    The commentary said that timely analysis of the specific local situation is particularly important after typhoons and rainstorms. Only by analyzing the specific situation can we maintain a clear mind, consider the overall situation, and determine our course of action, without being misled by certain temporary or localized phenomena. From the Ningbo Prefectural Committee's analysis of the situation in the entire district, it can be seen that only a few counties in this special district suffered the most severe damage, and only a few townships in these counties were severely affected. Even in the affected townships, the disaster situation is uneven, with some villages being more severely affected, some less so, and some villages basically unaffected. Therefore, the Party committees in the Ningbo area have adopted different measures based on these different situations: In heavily affected townships and villages, they are carrying out crash programs of production and disaster relief in the short term; in the vast majority of lightly affected and unaffected areas, they are focusing on mobilizing agricultural cooperatives to rush planting, while rapidly arranging various production activities to strive for an all-round bumper harvest. Rural Party organizations should quickly organize the forces of finance, economics, culture, education, health, and all other departments to support farmers in doing a good job in production. Disaster relief work in lightly affected areas must be carried out in conjunction with production. They have already seen good results from doing so. The commentary pointed out that after the typhoon and rainstorm, some leading organs in some places were unable to maintain a clear mind in the face of the disaster situation, and were unable to grasp the key points of the work for a time. In their work deployment, they only focused on disaster relief, while somewhat relaxing the work of resuming production. They only wanted reports from below on the disaster situation, but did not promptly summarize the rich experience of the masses in fighting the disaster, and vigorously lead the masses to overcome difficulties. In this situation, it is often easy to unilaterally exaggerate the disaster situation, putting oneself in a very passive situation, and production is naturally difficult to quickly recover. Comrades in these areas should, like the Ningbo Prefectural Committee, carefully analyze the local situation, specifically understand the extent of the disaster, the remedies available, and the demands of the masses. On the one hand, they should carry out crash programs of disaster relief and handle post-disaster affairs; on the other hand, they should quickly get production going.
    The commentary said that those who have been lightly affected or not affected should also analyze the new situation that has emerged after the rain, and continue to take strong measures to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's agricultural production plan. Now there are new signs of drought development, the third generation of rice stem borers and other various pests are in full swing, and the tasks of replanting, seedling replacement, and crop conversion after the rain are also very heavy. The objective situation does not allow us to have any relaxation. Therefore, all localities must pay attention to overcoming complacency, explain to cadres and the masses the importance of doing a good job in production in lightly affected and non-disaster areas, and explain that these areas should not only ensure the completion of the original production plan, but should also strive to overfulfill the production plan to make up for the losses in severely affected areas. This is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to themselves.

### 具体分析灾情掌握工作中心

专栏：地方报纸的评论

    具体分析灾情掌握工作中心
    八月十日浙江日报发表了宁波专区受台风灾害后恢复生产的报道说：由于党委及时实事求是地分析灾情，掌握工作中心，全面加强对各项生产的领导，因此这个专区恢复生产的工作进展很快。同日，报纸并以“分析受灾情况，加强对生产的全面领导”为题，发表评论。
    评论说，在台风暴雨之后，及时分析本地的具体情况，在当前显得特别重要。只有分析了具体情况之后，才能保持清醒的头脑，并且从全局着眼，定出自己的行动方针，不至于为一时一地的某些现象所迷惑。从宁波地委对全区情况的分析可以看出，这个专区受灾最重的也只是少数县，而这些县又只有少数乡受灾比较严重。在受灾乡中，灾情也是不平衡的，有的村重些，有的村轻些，有的村则基本上没有受灾。因此，宁波地区的党委就针对这些不同情况，采取了不同的措施：重灾乡、村在短期内突击进行生产救灾工作；绝大部分轻灾和不受灾的地区则以发动农业社突击抢种为重点，同时迅速安排各项生产，争取全面丰收。农村的党组织应迅速组织财经、文教、卫生等一切部门的力量来支持农民搞好生产。轻灾区的救灾工作，一定要结合生产进行。他们这样做以后，已经收到了很好的效果。评论指出，台风暴雨之后，也有些地方的领导机关，在灾情的面前，不能保持清醒的头脑，一时抓不住工作的重点。他们在工作部署上，只抓住救灾，而对恢复生产的工作却有点放松。他们光要下面汇报灾情，而不去及时总结群众抗灾的丰富经验，大力领导群众战胜困难。在这种情况下，就往往容易片面夸大灾情，使自己陷于十分被动的境地，生产当然也就很难迅速恢复了。这些地区的同志应该像宁波地委一样，很好地分析一下当地的情况，具体地了解一下受灾的程度、补救的办法和群众的要求。一面突击救灾、处理善后事宜，一面迅速把生产抓起来。
    评论说，那些受灾较轻和没有受灾的，也应当分析一下雨后出现的新情况，继续采取强有力的措施，保证完成和超额完成今年的农业生产计划。现在旱情又有新发展的迹象，三化螟第三代和其他各种害虫正在盛发，雨后抢种、补苗、改种的任务也十分繁重，客观形势不容许我们有任何的松懈情绪。因此，各地一定要注意克服松懈情绪，向干部和群众说明搞好轻灾区和非灾区的生产的重要意义，说明这些地区不仅要保证完成原定的生产计划，而且应当努力争取超额完成生产计划，来弥补重灾区的损失。这不但对国家有利，对自己也有好处。
