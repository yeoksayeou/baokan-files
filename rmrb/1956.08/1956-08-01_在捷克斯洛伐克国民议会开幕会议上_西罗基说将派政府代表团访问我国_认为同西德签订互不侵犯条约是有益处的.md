Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 31st. The 11th session of the Czechoslovak National Assembly opened in Prague on July 30th.

　　Prime Minister Široký delivered a government work report at the session. In his report, he announced that the Czechoslovak government, accepting the invitation of the government of the People's Republic of China, has decided to send a government delegation to visit China this year. All the deputies present warmly applauded this decision.

　　Speaking on the international situation, Široký pointed out that Czechoslovakia's friendly relations with Egypt, Syria, and other countries in the Middle East are developing smoothly. He pointed out that the positive policies adopted by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to oppose colonialism and safeguard Egypt's independence and the security of the Middle East have won the sympathy of all peace-loving countries. Prime Minister Široký said that the Czechoslovak people highly value India's positive contribution to the cause of world peace. He also spoke of the increasing development of Czechoslovakia's friendly relations with Afghanistan, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries. He said that Czechoslovakia deeply understands and sympathizes with the worldwide movement of all countries to strive for the final defeat of colonialism and to strive for the right of every country to live and progress in a free and independent environment.

　　Široký emphasized that a "fundamental change" in the relations between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia was achieved last year based on sincere friendship and mutual cooperation. He stated that Czechoslovakia supports the Soviet Union's efforts to promote peace and friendship among nations and to achieve collective security in Europe. He also said that the Czechoslovak government believes that concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany would be beneficial.

　　Speaking on domestic issues, Prime Minister Široký said that the government is determined to ensure the unwavering implementation of the resolutions of the Czechoslovak Communist Party's National Congress and will strive to complete the directives of the Second Five-Year Plan adopted by the congress.

　　Široký said that in Czechoslovakia, the supply of fuel, electricity, and raw materials to the national economy has improved, and the achievements of the past two years prove that the belief that the backwardness of agriculture can be overcome is correct. In the past few years, due to the smooth development of the national economy, the people's living standards have also improved significantly. In the past three years, the prices of daily necessities have been reduced by an average of 17%. He went on to say that the government is now preparing to improve the wage system, the national insurance system, and criminal law.

　　He announced that from October 1st, the working week for employees will be reduced to 46 hours without reducing wages, and a seven-hour workday will be implemented during the Second Five-Year Plan period. According to the Second Five-Year Plan, by 1960, employees' wages will increase by one-third compared to 1955. In developing the economy, necessary attention must be paid to East Slovakia and the border areas of the Czech states, as well as other areas that have not received enough attention in the past.

　　The Prime Minister also said that the Czechoslovak government is focusing its attention on preparing and implementing various measures for local decentralization in order to make it possible to lead the economic and cultural development of various regions more specifically and flexibly. In addition, the administrative staff of state and economic institutions will be reduced on the basis of streamlining administrative work.

　　Široký finally spoke about the constitutional bill submitted to the session for discussion on expanding the powers of the Slovak national institutions.

　　President Zápotocký and National Assembly Chairman Fierlinger attended the session.

　　The next session will continue on July 31st.
