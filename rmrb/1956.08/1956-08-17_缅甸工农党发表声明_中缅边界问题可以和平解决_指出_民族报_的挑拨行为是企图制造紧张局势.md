Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 16th: The Burmese Workers' and Peasants' Party issued a statement on August 14th saying: "'The Nation' newspaper calling the border incidents an act of aggression by Communist China is not only attempting to damage the peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries, but also inviting imperialists and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene." The statement also said that "'The Nation' newspaper's provocative behavior aims to create tension in this region."

The statement pointed out that "This issue is actually not an issue of aggression, but simply a matter of differing opinions between the two governments (Burma and China) regarding the border line."

The statement further explained, "The Sino-Burmese border issue is not a new issue between Burma and China. This issue existed long ago during the Kuomintang government and the British colonial government."

The statement said that, but now, this issue is not the same as before. The government of the People's China and the government of independent Burma have no intention of expansion. The agreement on the Five Principles between the two governments, the development of economic relations between the two countries, and the friendship between the leaders and people of the two countries can all prove this point.

The statement emphasized that "Therefore, the foundation exists for making the Sino-Burmese border a line of peace and friendship," and that the border issue can be resolved amicably through peaceful negotiations.

    缅甸工农党发表声明
    中缅边界问题可以和平解决
    指出“民族报”的挑拨行为是企图制造紧张局势
    据新华社仰光16日电　缅甸工农党八月十四日发表声明说：“‘民族报’把边境事件叫作共产党中国的侵略行为，不仅是企图破坏两国间的和平友好关系，并且是在邀请帝国主义者和东南亚条约组织来实行干涉”。声明又说，“民族报”的“这一挑拨行为的目的是要在这个地区制造紧张局势”。
    这个声明指出，“这个问题实际上并不是侵略问题，而只是两国政府（缅甸和中国）对于边境的界线具有不同意见的问题。”
    声明进一步说明，“中缅边界问题并不是缅甸和中国之间新发生的问题。这个问题是在国民党政府和英国殖民政府时代早就存在的”。
    声明说，但是在现在，这个问题已经不是像以前那样了。人民中国的政府和独立的缅甸的政府都无意实行扩张。两国政府关于五项原则的协议，两国经济关系的发展以及两国领袖和人民间的友谊都可以证明这一点。
    声明强调说，“因此，使中缅边界成为一条和平和友谊界线的基础是存在的”，边界问题是可以通过和平谈判来和好地解决的。
