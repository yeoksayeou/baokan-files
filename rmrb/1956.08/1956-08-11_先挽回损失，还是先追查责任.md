    First Salvage the Losses, or First Investigate Responsibility?

    The Tangshan Municipal Public-Private Jointly Operated Dalun Dyeing Factory is a processing plant specializing in dyeing various blue and black khaki fabrics for the Tangshan Municipal Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company. In early July, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company discovered during a warehouse inspection that 14,800 bolts of blue and black khaki fabric in the Dalun Dyeing Factory's inventory did not meet quality standards, with a moisture content exceeding 8%. Some had a moisture content as high as 10%. On July 15th, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company formally proposed to the Dalun Dyeing Factory that these fabrics be returned for reprocessing. The Dalun Dyeing Factory argued: Why didn't the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company inspect them upon entry into the warehouse? This responsibility should be borne by the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company itself, leading to endless disputes. In fact, the Dalun Dyeing Factory had already discovered in February and March of this year that the moisture content of the khaki fabric leaving the factory exceeded the prescribed standards and should have been baked again. However, the Dalun Dyeing Factory, simply to catch up with the task, believed that even if these fabrics were not dry, they would not mold within a year, and hearing that khaki fabric was out of stock on the market, they relaxed their inspection work, resulting in a large number of unqualified products leaving the factory. The Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company used to have a relatively complete inspection, warehousing, and sampling system, but since this year, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company believed that since the contract stipulated that the Dalun Dyeing Factory would be responsible for any dampness or mold within one year of warehousing, they abolished these systems. In March of this year, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company's retail department discovered that the Dalun Dyeing Factory's fabric had a high moisture content, but this did not attract attention until early July when the central government sent people to organize a working group with the municipal departments concerned to inspect the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company's warehouse, and these fabrics were found. According to preliminary statistics, after all these fabrics are reworked, the direct losses alone (only dismantling, packaging, and handling wages) will amount to more than 1,000 yuan. What is serious is that the season for dampness and mold has arrived, and the two sides are still arguing about who should be responsible.

    May I ask the leaders of both sides: Are you going to deal with this problem first and then "investigate responsibility"? Or are you going to wait until all these fabrics are moldy before investigating responsibility together?

### 先挽回损失，还是先追查责任

    先挽回损失，还是先追查责任
    唐山市公私合营大伦染厂是专为唐山市花纱布公司加染各种青、蓝卡其布的加工厂。七月初花纱布公司在检查仓库的时候，发现库存大伦染厂的一万四千八百匹青蓝卡其布不合乎质量标准，含水率超过8％。有的含水率高达10％。花纱布公司就在七月十五日正式向大伦染厂提出：要把这些布退回大伦染厂重行加工。大伦染厂认为：花纱布公司入库的时候为什么不检查？这个责任应由花纱布公司自己负，就这样争执不休。其实大伦染厂早在今年二、三月份就发现了出厂的卡其布水分超过规定标准，本来应该再烘一遍。可是大伦染厂单纯为了追赶任务，认为这些布即便不干，在一年内也不会霉烂，又听说市场上卡其布脱销，就放松了检验工作，使不合格的产品大量出厂。花纱布公司过去有一套比较完善的检查入库和抽查制度，可是今年以来，花纱布公司认为反正合同上规定了入库的布在一年内生潮、发霉得由大伦染厂负责，因此就把这些制度取消了。今年三月份花纱布公司门市部曾发现大伦染厂的布含水率高，但是没有引起注意，直到七月初中央派人同市有关部门组织工作组检查花纱布公司的仓库，才把这些布检查出来。据初步统计这些布全部反工后，仅直接损失
  （只拆、包装和搬运工资）就达一千多元。严重的是发潮和发霉的季节已经到了，双方还在为究竟由谁负责而争执不休。
    请问双方领导人员：你们还是先把这个问题处理以后再“追查责任”呢？还是准备等这些布全部霉烂以后，一起追查责任呢？
