To the Editor:

    In July, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau held a Party representative meeting. At the meeting, the representatives raised many opinions on the living conditions of the employees. The main problem was that the leading cadres of the Engineering Bureau took too much care of their own lives, while caring too little about the welfare of ordinary employees. Everyone demanded a swift change to this situation.

    Taking housing as an example, the difficulty of having more people than houses is an objective reality. Precisely because housing is difficult, it is even more necessary to make a reasonable distribution of the existing houses. But how did the Engineering Bureau allocate houses? Please see: Cadres at or above the level of department director live in exquisite and comfortable "high-level cadre dormitories," each household having three bedrooms, one reception room, and one each of storage room, bathroom, and kitchen, a total of seven rooms, 68 square meters; those below the level of section chief live in general dormitories, section chiefs living in two rooms per household, 26 square meters, and general employees living in one room per household, 13 square meters. According to this regulation, the result is this: Some cadres at or above the level of department director have only two people, husband and wife, living in seven rooms (actually four rooms can be used as bedrooms), while employees, even if they have ten family members, are crammed into one room. And being able to get one room is considered lucky, because some employees can't even get one room and have to live in sheds. Ordinary employees have opinions about such an excessively disparate distribution method, but some leading cadres obviously haven't paid attention to the opinions of the masses, and even emphasize that doing so is taking care of senior intellectuals. Is it really "taking care" of senior intellectuals? Not entirely. Chen Changyan, a first-class engineer in the bureau, is a non-Party senior intellectual and also a department-level cadre, but his family of eight, spanning three generations, still lives crammed into two rooms in the general cadre dormitory; while Zhu Shiyuan, a Party member and deputy chief engineer, only has his wife, yet they live in a set of houses (seven rooms) in the "high-level cadre dormitory." Can this be considered implementing the Party's policy towards senior intellectuals?

    Not only is the gap between the living conditions of leading cadres and ordinary employees excessively large in terms of housing, but leading cadres are also given excessive care in the use of furniture. Taking the family of a bureau director as an example, the public has purchased for him four sofas, eight leather chairs, two armchairs, a dining table with a set of stools, a glass-inlaid rattan round table and a set of rattan chairs, three desks, as well as wardrobes, bookshelves, tea cabinets, bedside tables, clothes racks, and palm beds and other large quantities of furniture. However, it is impossible for employees renting private houses to borrow a stool or a plank from the bureau.

    Since the "high-level cadre dormitories" occupied by cadres at or above the level of department director are good houses with complete equipment, they should pay rent to the public according to their rank. However, they only pay 5.16 yuan per month for seven rooms per household. Taking the four rooms that can be used as bedrooms as an example, they pay an average of only 1.29 yuan per room, while general employees have to pay 1.37 yuan per month for one room, which is higher than the rent they pay. (Employees renting private houses pay even higher rent.) At the same time, many houses in "Liberation New Village" (the dormitory for general cadres) leak from above and are damp below, have no kitchens, and an average of five or six hundred people share one toilet. People have to wait about a quarter of an hour every morning to get a chance to use the toilet. These are problems that the Engineering Bureau can solve, but they have been dragging on without resolution. More seriously, some workers' sheds don't even have windows, and the inside is damp, dark, and smelly. The workers have asked the bureau to open a window, but it has not been opened.

    Similarly, there are also very unreasonable phenomena in the subsidy for employees with living difficulties. If an ordinary employee has living difficulties and requests a subsidy, it must go through group discussions, research by the basic-level trade union, and approval by the higher-level trade union. Not to mention the complicated procedures, they often cannot get a subsidy. But what about the leading cadres? The Political Department of the Engineering Bureau had a sum of cadre subsidies in the first half of this year. They stipulated that all cadres at or above the level of section chief could receive subsidies regardless of whether they had living difficulties. As a result, Dai Shufen, the director of the Political Department's Organization Department, received a subsidy of 100 yuan one day, and the next day his wife went to the street to buy fashionable clothes and high-heeled leather shoes. The same is true for the issue of bonuses. At the end of last year, ordinary employees participated in the evaluation and were awarded bonuses in three grades: A, B, and C, according to their work performance; but cadres at or above the level of department director received a bonus of 60 yuan each, regardless of their work performance. Are all cadres at or above the level of department director doing a perfect job? Zheng Jie, the Minister of the Political Department's Propaganda Department, often sleeps in the office and does not do a good job. Everyone has many opinions about him, but he also received a "bonus" of 60 yuan according to regulations. This is really a strange bonus. What role can such a reward play?

    Wuhan is very hot in the summer. Offices and some high-temperature workshops on various construction sites have not installed electric fans, and people can only work hard in the hot weather, sweating profusely; but cadres at or above the level of department director not only have electric fans in their offices, but also have electric fans installed in their dormitories by the public, one for each household. Many construction sites have not yet built reed mat sheds, but in the "high-level cadre dormitory" area, two pavilions with red pillars and green eaves were built long ago, spending more than 1,700 yuan.

    Although the representatives raised many opinions on these issues at the Party representative meeting, the presidium of the meeting did not seem to seriously consider them, and only generally said in the final summary that the leadership did not care enough about the lives of the masses. Are the facts mentioned above merely a matter of not caring enough about the lives of the masses? Taking such good care of the lives of leading cadres and not caring enough about the lives of the masses, what is this problem, and why not check it? At present, under the overall deployment of the Ministry of Railways, the Bridge Engineering Bureau has begun to prepare to spend some money to solve the problem of employee welfare. As for how to change the situation of excessively special treatment for leading cadres, there is still no movement. This is mainly because some leading comrades still believe that they should enjoy many unreasonable treatments, so they avoid talking about it at the meeting and do not start to change it after the meeting. Is it reasonable to receive a subsidy when there is no difficulty in life? Is it reasonable not to build sheds on the construction site or install electric fans in the construction site office, but to build sheds and install electric fans in one's own dormitory? Is it reasonable to live in the best house and pay the lowest rent? Comrades are not demanding "equality," but demanding reasonableness, demanding that these unreasonable phenomena be eliminated while solving the problem of employees' living difficulties.

### 不要求“平均”，而要求合理

    不要求“平均”，而要求合理编辑同志：
    七月里，武汉长江大桥工程局召开了党代表大会，会上代表们对职工生活问题提了许多意见。主要问题是工程局领导干部对自己的生活照顾得太多，而对一般职工的生活福利关心得太少了。大家要求迅速改变这种状况。
    拿住房来说，人多房子少是客观存在的困难。正因为房子困难，就更需要把现有的房子作合理的分配。可是工程局把房子是怎样分配的呢？请看：处长以上的干部住精致舒适的“高干宿舍”，每户有三个卧室、一个会客室和储藏室、卫生间、厨房各一间，一共七间，六十八平方公尺；科长以下的住一般宿舍，科长每户住两间，二十六平方公尺，一般职工每户住一间，十三平方公尺。按照这一规定就造成了这样的结果：有的处长以上的干部只有夫妻两口住了七间房（实际能作卧室的有四间），而职工哪怕家有十口，也挤在一个房间里。而一家能够分到一间房子还算幸运，因为有些职工连一间也分配不到，只好住在席棚里。对这样过份悬殊的分配办法，一般职工有意见，而有的领导干部显然没有重视群众的意见，还强调说这样做是照顾高级知识分子。真是“照顾”高级知识分子吗？也不完全是这样。局里一等工程师陈昌言是个非党的高级知识分子，也是处长级干部，但他家三代八口人至今仍然挤住在一般干部宿舍的两个房间里；而党员副总工程师朱世源一家只夫妇两人，却在“高干宿舍”里住了一套房子（七间），这能算贯彻党对高级知识分子的政策吗？
    不但住房问题上领导干部和一般职工相比过份悬殊，在使用家具上也对领导干部作了过多的照顾。以一户局长的家庭来说，公家就为他购置了沙发四件、皮椅八个、靠椅二个、餐桌连凳子一套、镶玻璃的藤圆桌和藤椅一套、写字台三张，还有衣柜、书柜、茶柜、床头柜、衣架和架子棕床等大批家具。而租用民房的职工想向局里借一张凳子、一付铺板也办不到。
    既然处长以上的干部所住的“高干宿舍”房子好，设备齐全，那就应该按等级向公家缴房租。可是，他们每户七间每月才出房租五元一角六分。就拿能作卧室的四间来计算，他们平均每间才出一元二角九分，而一般职工所住的一间房子每月得出一元三角七分，比他们出的房租还高。（租用民房住的职工，所出的租费就更高了。）同时，“解放新村”（一般干部的宿舍）的许多房子上漏下湿，没有厨房，并且是平均五、六百人共用一个厕所，人们每天早晨起来要等一刻钟左右才轮到上厕所的机会。这些问题都是工程局所能解决的，但始终拖着没有解决。更严重的是有些工人住的工棚连个窗户也没有，里面潮湿阴暗、臭气熏人，工人们要求局里开个窗户，也一直不给开。
    对职工生活困难的补助，同样存在着十分不合理的现象。如果是一般职工生活有困难请求补助，那就要经过小组讨论，基层工会研究，上级工会批准，手续繁杂不说，往往还不能得到补助。但是领导干部怎样呢？工程局政治部今年上半年有笔干部补助费，他们规定凡是科长以上的干部不管生活是否困难一律可受补助，结果，政治部组织部部长戴树芬头天收下一百元补助费，第二天他爱人就上街去买了时装和高跟皮鞋。在发奖金的问题上也是如此。去年年终评奖，一般职工都参加评比，按各人工作成绩分甲、乙、丙三等发奖；但处长以上的干部不论工作好坏，每人一律领到奖金六十元。难道处长以上的干部工作都做得尽善尽美了吗？政治部宣传部长郑杰时常在办公室里睡大觉，工作做得不好，大家对他意见很多，但他也按规定得到了六十元“奖金”。这真是一种奇怪的奖金，这样的奖励能起什么作用呢？
    武汉夏季酷热，各工地办公室和若干高温车间都未安装电扇，人们只能在炎热的天气里，汗流浃背地紧张工作；而处长以上的干部呢，不但办公室里有电扇，连他们的宿舍里也由公家设置了电扇，每户一把。许多工地都还没有搭起芦席凉棚，而在“高干宿舍”区里，早就花一千七百多元修盖了两座红柱绿檐的凉亭。
    虽然代表们在党代表大会上对这些问题提了许多意见，但大会主席团仿佛并没有认真考虑，只是在最后的总结中一般地说了说领导上对群众生活关心不够。难道上面说的这些事实，仅仅是对群众生活关心不够吗？对领导干部的生活关心得那么周到，对群众的生活关心得这么不够，这又是什么问题，为什么不检查检查呢？目前，大桥工程局在铁道部整个部署下，已开始准备花些钱来解决职工生活福利问题。至于如何改变领导干部生活待遇太特殊的状况，则至今不见什么动静。这主要是有的领导同志还认为他们应该享受很多不合理的待遇，所以在会上避而不谈，会后也不着手改变。难道生活没有困难而领补助费是合理的吗？难道工地上都不给搭凉棚，工地办公室都不安电扇，却给自己宿舍搭凉棚、装电扇是合理的吗？难道房子住的最好而房租出的最低是合理的吗？同志们不是要求“平均”，而是要求合理，要求在解决职工生活困难问题的同时，消除这些不合理的现象。
