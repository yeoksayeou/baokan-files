    New York City's Juvenile Crime Rate Soars

    According to a July 30th report in the "New York Times," the New York Police Commissioner stated in his semi-annual work report that juvenile crime cases in New York City increased by 41.3% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. A total of 4,826 boys and girls under the age of sixteen were arrested, compared to only 3,416 in the same period last year. The Police Commissioner requested an additional five thousand police officers, saying that the best way to protect citizens and property is to have "patrol officers on duty."

        An Episode in the Bullring

    When the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet docked in Barcelona, Spain, it coincided with a bullfighting festival in Barcelona. Many American sailors came to the bullring. They crowded the stands and occupied the best seats. When the bullfighter killed the bull and triumphantly circled the arena, the crowd responded with enthusiastic cheers and applause. At this moment, an American sailor in the stands also cheered, throwing his hat in front of the bullfighter's feet. The bullfighter instinctively took off his own bullfighting hat and picked up the American sailor's hat, placing it on his head. In that instant, the cheering of the crowd suddenly subsided, and a chorus of boos erupted from all around. The bullfighter realized that the crowd's emotions had changed and quickly took off the American sailor's hat, threw it on the ground, and put his own bullfighting hat back on. The square once again resounded with enthusiastic cheers and applause.

        斗牛场上的插曲
    美国地中海舰队在西班牙巴塞罗那港停泊的时候，正逢巴塞罗那举行斗牛盛会。在斗牛广场里来了不少的美国水兵。他们拥上看台，占据了最好的座位。当斗牛士把牛刺死，胜利地绕场一周时，群众报以狂热的欢呼与鼓掌。这时，看台上有一名美国水兵也在叫好，他把自己的帽子抛在场中斗牛士的脚前。这位斗牛士下意识地脱掉了自己的斗牛士的帽子，拾起美国水兵帽戴在头上。就在这一瞬间，群众欢呼的声音突然沉寂了，四周发出一阵嘘嘘的声音。斗牛士发现群众的情绪起了这种变化，赶快把美国水兵帽脱下，丢在地上，重新戴起自己斗牛士的帽子。广场里又响起了一阵热烈的欢呼与鼓掌。
