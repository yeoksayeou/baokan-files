The Guixi County Committee of the Communist Youth League of Jiangxi Province had its office unmanned for a full ten months from August 1955 to May 1956. Where did the cadres of the County Youth League Committee go? Some were transferred to do religious work, some were transferred to do archival work, and some were transferred to do work in central townships. As a result, the grassroots organizations of the League in these areas were left without leadership for a long time, and many problems could not be resolved.

Why were these cadres casually transferred to do this or that work, resulting in the long-term abandonment of their own work? This is because the Guixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party still adopted a "one-size-fits-all" approach to work. Whenever a central task came along, it would uniformly transfer cadres from mass organizations. The Guixi County Committee of the Communist Youth League was thus uniformly transferred, leaving it without leadership for a long period. What is the result of only paying attention to central work and neglecting departmental work? As some people have said, "Added a few staff members, but collapsed a mass organization." How can work be more beneficial? The Guixi County Committee really ought to study this.

    青年团工作停顿
    青年团江西省贵溪县委机关自1955年8月至1956年5月，整整十个月，没有人办公。团县委的干部都到哪里去了呢？有的被调去做宗教工作，有的被调去做档案工作，有的被调去做中心乡的工作。于是这些地区团的基层组织长期处于无人负责的状态，许多问题得不到解决。
    为什么这些干部会被随便调去做这样或那样工作以致他们本身的工作反而被长期放弃了呢？这是因为中共贵溪县委仍旧采取一揽子的工作方法，任何中心任务一来，就统一调用群众团体的干部，青年团贵溪县委就是这样被统一调用得长期无人负责的。这样只管中心工作，不管部门业务工作，其结果如何呢？正如有些人所说的一样：“多了几个工作人员，垮了一个群众团体的组织”。究竟怎样才对工作更有利？贵溪县委实在应当研究一下。
