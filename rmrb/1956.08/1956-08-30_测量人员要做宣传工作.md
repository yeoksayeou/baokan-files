    Surveyors Should Do Propaganda Work

    Recently, the triangulation team of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission came to our area to conduct measurements. They erected flags and scaffolds on the mountains, attracting many people. On the one hand, the masses felt novel and happy about this new thing they had never seen before; on the other hand, some people did have quite a few doubts.

    For example, once, a surveyor bent down on the road to adjust his shoes, and a farmer saw it and mistakenly thought he was doing some kind of "trick." After the surveyor left, the farmer secretly went to the place where he adjusted his shoes to see what was going on. The surveyor buried something under the scaffold, and the masses mistakenly thought it was a "talisman." The surveyor installed lightning rods on top of the scaffold, and the masses thought it was for "warding off evil."

    The masses once asked the surveyors: "Are you here to steal treasure?" Not only did they not explain, but they readily replied "Yes, we are stealing treasure." This increased the masses' doubts and aroused their dissatisfaction. I hope the surveyors will do more propaganda work and not remain silent when they see the masses.

    测量人员要做宣传工作
    长江水利委员会三角测量队，最近到我们这里进行测量。他们在山上插起旗子，搭起架子，吸引了许多群众。一方面，群众对这种从来不曾看见过的新事，感到新奇高兴；另一方面确实有一部分群众产生了不少怀疑。
    例如有一次，一个测量人员在路上弯腰提了一下鞋子，被一个农民看见了，误认为在搞什么“把戏”，测量人员走后，那个农民便偷偷地到提鞋的地方去看究竟。测量人员在架子底下埋了一个东西，群众就误认为下了什么“镇物”；测量人员在架子顶上安装了避电针，群众就认为是“避邪”的。
    群众曾向测量人员询问：“你们是来盗宝的吧？”他们不但不解释，反而顺口答复“是盗宝的”。这就增加了群众的疑虑，引起群众不满。希望测量人员多作宣传工作，不要见到群众不说话。
