Six Thousand Employees, Eight Shower Heads
Since Zhengzhou No. 4 State-owned Cotton Mill implemented anti-waste measures in the first half of last year, they drastically reduced the number of shower heads from fifty-two to eight (four for men, four for women). How can six thousand employees possibly take showers with only eight shower heads!

The No. 4 State-owned Cotton Mill and the Henan Textile Industry Bureau have raised this issue with higher authorities several times, but the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry refuses to resolve it, using reasons such as "limited state investment" and "a solution will be found within the factory director's fund after production begins." Alternatively, they suggest sharing a bathhouse with the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill. The No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill is not close to the No. 4 State-owned Cotton Mill. After working eight hours, employees would have to walk one and a half li to take a shower, leaving no time for anything else. The Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry should listen to the voices of the masses and find a way to solve this problem.

### 六千名职工八个淋浴头

    六千名职工八个淋浴头
    郑州国棉四厂去年上半年反浪费以后，一下子把淋浴头从五十二个减为八个（男四、女四）。试问六千名职工，只有八个淋浴头怎么洗澡呢！
    国棉四厂和河南纺织工业管理局为了这件事，向领导上提过好几回意见，纺织工业部基本建设总局拿：“国家投资有限”“将来生产后在厂长基金内设法解决”作理由不给解决，再不然就要求同国棉三厂合用一个浴池。国棉三厂同国棉四厂距离不算近，职工工作八小时以后，还要走一里半路去洗澡，就不用干别的了。纺织工业部基建局应该听一听群众的呼声，设法解决这个问题。　群众
