    At the All-Union Sports Meet

    Middleweight Press Sets World Record
    Young athlete Minayev has set a new world record in the middleweight press, the first world record to be broken at the All-Union Sports Meet.

    On the second day of the All-Union Sports Meet, the Moscow University indoor stadium was packed with spectators. Weightlifting record attempts were taking place. When the referee announced, "114 kg middleweight press, Minayev is ready," people wondered who Minayev was. No one in the audience knew him. When the short Minayev appeared, people doubted whether he could break the record. Minayev calmly looked at the audience, then looked at the barbell, took a deep breath, placed his hands on the bar, and lightly lifted the 114 kg barbell to his chest, then slowly pushed it above his head. At this moment, the whole arena erupted in applause. Twenty-three-year-old Minayev is a tank mechanic. He only started learning weightlifting last year. His new result broke Korzh's world record of 113.5 kg. (Dai Feng)

    New Swimming Pool, New Records
    The newly built swimming pool at the Moscow Central Stadium is not 25 meters long, but 50 meters long. There is a big difference between 50 meters and 25 meters in competition. In a 100-meter race in a 25-meter pool, athletes have to turn three times, and they can take advantage of each turn to push off the wall and gain time. Balankin won the men's 100-meter freestyle. He reached the finish line at the same time as twenty-year-old athlete Sorokin, and both had a time of 57.6 seconds. The women's 100-meter freestyle All-Union record, which had been held for 14 years, was broken last year by Volga, a middle school student from Estonia. On August 8, at the All-Union Sports Meet, she broke the women's 100-meter freestyle All-Union record in a 50-meter pool again with a time of 1 minute 7.1 seconds. The result of the men's 200-meter butterfly final was: Rubachov, a player from the Russian Federal Republic, won the All-Union championship with a time of 2 minutes 33.7 seconds.

    Women's 200-meter Breaststroke Final Champion
    On August 7, the women's 200-meter breaststroke final was held at the Central Stadium swimming pool. The final result was somewhat unexpected. Eighteen-year-old Ukrainian girl Kovalyenko won the national championship title with a time of 3 minutes 0.9 seconds. At the award ceremony, Kovalyenko received a gold medal, a champion certificate, and a set of Soviet champion uniforms.

    Kovalyenko is a student who just graduated from a middle school in Kyiv this year. Because of her consistently excellent academic performance, she received a gold medal upon graduation. Therefore, this year brought Kovalyenko two gold medals. She achieved excellent results in both her studies and sports.

    A Giant Basketball Player
    At the Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow, a basketball player is increasingly attracting the attention of spectators and basketball experts. This person is seven feet six and a half inches tall (2.29 meters) and weighs four hundred and four pounds (183 kilograms). His name is Vasily Akhtayev.

    Akhtayev comes from Almaty and is the center of the Kazakh basketball team. In a game between this team and the Turkmen team, the score was ninety-six to forty-five, and he scored forty-seven points alone.

    His style of play is to move back and forth under the basket, and when he receives the ball, he simply reaches out and puts the ball into the basket.

    Akhtayev started participating in sports activities by throwing the shot put, and he could throw the shot put to a place more than forty-one feet (12.49 meters) away, but he didn't like this sport, so he switched to volleyball, and later felt that the other athletes were too small, and he was afraid of hurting them, so finally he went to the basketball court. There, with more tall athletes, he felt more comfortable. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在全苏运动大会上
    中级推举创世界纪录
    青年运动员米纳耶夫创造了中级推举世界新纪录，这是全苏运动大会上出现的第一个世界新纪录。
    全苏运动大会第二天，莫斯科大学室内运动场挤满了观众。这里进行举重创纪录比赛。当裁判员宣布：114公斤中级推举，米纳耶夫准备时，人们纷纷议论谁是米纳耶夫。没有一个观众知道他。当个子不高的米纳耶夫出现时，人们怀疑他能否创造纪录。米纳耶夫沉着地望望观众，然后又看一下举重杠铃，深深地吸了一口气，双手按到杠轴上，轻快地将114公斤重的杠铃提到了胸前，之后又慢慢地将它推到头顶上。这时，全场爆发一片掌声。二十三岁的米纳耶夫是坦克机械师。他在去年才开始学习举重。他的新成绩打破了科尔日的113.5公斤世界纪录。　（戴枫）
    新式游泳池、新的纪录
    新建的莫斯科中央运动场的游泳池的长度不是二十五公尺，而是五十公尺。五十公尺和二十五公尺在比赛中有很大差别。在二十五公尺的游泳池里举行一百公尺比赛要转三次弯，运动员可以利用每次转弯的机会在池壁上蹬脚取巧，争取时间。巴兰金获得了男子一百公尺自由式的冠军。和他同时达到终点的还有二十岁的运动员索罗金，两个人的成绩都是五十七点六秒。保持了十四年之久的女子一百公尺自由式全苏纪录去年被爱沙尼亚的一个中学生沃加打破。八月八日在全苏运动大会上她又以一分七秒一的成绩打破了在五十公尺游泳池里女子一百公尺自由式全苏纪录。男子二百公尺蝶式决赛结果是：俄罗斯联邦共和国选手鲁巴乔夫以两分三十三秒七获得全苏冠军。
    女子二百公尺俯泳决赛冠军
    八月七日在中央运动场游泳池举行了女子二百公尺俯泳决赛。决赛结果使人感到有些突然。十八岁的乌克兰姑娘科瓦连科获得了全国冠军的称号，成绩是三分零点九秒。在授奖会上科瓦连科得到了金质奖章、冠军证书和苏联冠军制服一套。
    科瓦连科是今年刚从基辅一个中学毕业的学生，由于一贯学习成绩优良，在毕业时她得到一枚金质奖章。因此，今年给科瓦连科带来了两枚金质奖章。在学习上和运动上她都获得了出色的成绩。

    一位巨人篮球队员
    在莫斯科的列宁中央运动场上，有一个篮球运动员越来越引起观众和篮球运动专家们的注意。这个人身高七呎六吋半（二公尺二十九公分），体重四百零四磅（一百八十三公斤）。他的名字叫瓦西里·阿赫塔耶夫。
    阿赫塔耶夫来自阿拉木图，是哈萨克篮球队的中锋。这个队同土库曼队的一场比赛，比数是九十六对四十五，而他一个人就得了四十七分。
    他的打法是在篮下来回窜动，等接到来球就轻轻地一伸手把球投入篮中。
    阿赫塔耶夫开始参加体育活动的时候是推铅球，他能够把铅球推到四十一呎（十二公尺四十九公分）开外的地方去，但是他不欢喜这项运动，于是转而玩排球，后来又感到其他运动员个子太小，他怕伤了他们，所以最后他转进了篮球场。在那里，高大的运动员较多，他才感到比较自在些。　（新华社）
