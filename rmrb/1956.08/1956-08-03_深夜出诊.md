    Midnight House Call
    On a certain island on the Fujian front lines, Guo Wei, a health worker of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was fast asleep when he was suddenly awakened:
    "Health worker, health worker, please get up and have a look, an old fellow villager's child is very ill." The company's instructor, leading two old people, stood in front of Guo Wei's bed, urging Guo Wei to get up quickly.
    As soon as health worker Guo Wei heard there was a seriously ill patient, he jumped up, slung his medical kit over his shoulder, and followed the old people.
    It was raining heavily, the sea wind was howling, and the night was so dark it felt like a thick cloth had been put over people's eyes. Guo Wei followed the two old people, stumbling along, getting mud and water all over himself.
    Guo Wei arrived at the home of one of the old people. A child was no longer crying, his throat filled with a lot of mucus. Unable to breathe, his whole body was turning blue-purple. Guo Wei felt anxious when he saw this. If the mucus in his throat couldn't be extracted within half an hour, the child wouldn't survive! But the hospital was far away, and his company didn't have this kind of medical equipment. What to do! Guo Wei thought for a moment and decided to overcome the difficulties himself. He first gave the child an injection, and then used his hands to replace the "mouth opener," opening the child's mouth, and using a syringe to replace the "suction catheter," trying to suck the mucus out of his throat. He actually succeeded! The mucus was drawn into the syringe, and the child was able to breathe.
    Guo Wei braved the rain to return to the company to get medical supplies, his teeth chattering from the cold, his whole body shivering. Around two o'clock in the morning, Guo Wei went to the old fellow villager's house again and gave the child another injection. Soon, the baby was out of danger. When the sun came out in the morning, the child was already able to nurse. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 深夜出诊

    深夜出诊
    在福建前线某海岛上，中国人民解放军某部卫生员郭伟同志已经熟睡了，突然被人唤醒：
    “卫生员，卫生员，快些起来去看看，有个老乡的孩子病得很重。”连的指导员领着两个老百姓站在郭伟的床前，催郭伟快些起来。
    卫生员郭伟一听有重病人，一骨碌爬起来，背起出诊包就随着老乡去了。
    这时候正在下着大雨，海风嚎叫着，夜黑得像在人们的眼睛上蒙了厚厚的一块布。郭伟跟着两个老乡跌跌撞撞地走去，弄得身上又是泥、又是水。
    郭伟来到了一个老乡的家里，老乡的一个孩子已经不会哭叫了，喉咙里集塞了许多粘液，由于喘不出气来，蹩得浑身发了青紫色。郭伟一看心中有些着急，如果半小时内不能把喉咙里的粘液抽出来，小孩就活不了啦！可是医院离这个地方很远，而自己连队又没有这种医疗器械，这可怎么办！郭伟想了想，下定决心由自己来克服困难。他先给孩子打了一针，然后用双手代替“开口器”，把孩子的嘴打开，用注射器代替“吸痰器”试着把喉咙里的粘液吸出来。他居然试验成功了，粘液被抽在注射器里，孩子能够喘出气来了。
    郭伟又冒着雨赶回连部取医药用品，冻得上牙碰下牙，浑身打颤。夜晚两点钟左右，郭伟又往老乡家里跑了一趟，给孩子打了一针。不久，这个婴孩转危为安了。早晨太阳出来的时候，这个孩子已经能够吃奶了。　（新华社）
