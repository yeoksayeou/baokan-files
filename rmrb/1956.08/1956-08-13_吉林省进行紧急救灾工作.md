Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 11th: Eight work teams from Jilin Province departed for disaster areas on the 9th to conduct emergency disaster relief work.

With the northward movement of the low-pressure system in North China and the southward shift of the Siberian air current, from the 6th to the 7th, a heavy rainstorm occurred in a 50-kilometer wide and 360-kilometer long area in northern Jilin Province, including Fuyu, Dehui, Yushu, and Shulan counties. Rainfall ranged from 110 mm to 238 mm, causing flooding in some areas. The total area of ​​cultivated land flooded and waterlogged in the province increased from more than 300,000 hectares in July to approximately 540,000 hectares.

After the rainstorm, party and government leading organs in Fuyu and other counties urgently mobilized all forces to rescue people using steamships, wooden boats, and all water transportation tools, and organized drainage and disaster relief. The county head of Fuyu County led more than 7,000 people and has rescued more than 900 households out of more than 1,300 households surrounded by water, and has rushed to transport more than 80,000 catties of grain; rescue work is still continuing. The Jilin Provincial People's Committee has allocated emergency relief funds to the disaster areas.

On the Nenjiang River line, where the water level is still high and the wind and waves are strong, the secretary of the Baicheng Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is leading more than 30,000 people in building dikes to prevent the disaster from expanding.

The Jilin Provincial People's Committee held an emergency meeting on the 9th, deciding that flood prevention, drainage, and disaster relief work in the disaster areas should be listed as one of the current central tasks, and decided to establish a disaster relief committee. The meeting made emergency arrangements for providing loans to disaster victims, supplying grain and livestock feed, and preventing and treating diseases.

    吉林省进行紧急救灾工作
    新华社长春11日电　吉林省八个工作组在九日分赴灾区，进行紧急救灾工作。
    随着华北的低气压的北上和西伯利亚气流的南移，六、七两日，吉林省北部扶余、德惠、榆树、舒兰等县五十公里宽、三百六十公里长的地带降下了一场大暴雨。降雨量在一百一十公厘到二百三十八公厘，因此有些地方发生水灾。全省被淹和内涝的耕地面积，由七月份的三十多万公顷增加到五十四万公顷左右。
    扶余等县在暴雨过后，党、政领导机关紧急动员各方面的力量，利用汽船、木船和一切水上交通工具救人，并且组织排涝救灾。扶余县县长率领七千多人，已经把被水围住的一千三百多户农民救出了九百多户，抢运出粮食八万多斤；现在还在继续抢救。吉林省人民委员会已经对受灾地区拨下了急救款。
    在水位仍高、风浪又大的嫩江线上，中共白城地方委员会书记领导的三万多人正在紧张筑堤，防止灾情扩大。
    吉林省人民委员会九日召开紧急会议，决定灾区应把防汛、排涝和救灾工作列为当前中心工作之一，并且决定成立救灾委员会。对灾民发放贷款、供给粮食和牲畜饲料、防治疾病等，会议都作了紧急安排。
