Please Write Articles More Simply: Readers' Opinions on the Style of Articles in the Supplement

Many readers have written to express their enjoyment of the articles in the People's Daily's eighth-page supplement. However, some readers feel that some articles in the supplement "cite too many and too deep classical allusions, and are not simple enough"; "they like to use a semi-classical style, favoring obscure words and recondite allusions." Readers find it difficult to understand and feel that this is a shortcoming.

For example, reader Wang Qi wrote: The article "A Prime Minister's Belly" published on the eighth page on July 2 cited the sentence "The world tends to the same goal by different routes, and arrives at the same destination through a hundred deliberations" from the "Book of Changes". Several comrades with a high school education did not fully understand it and could only vaguely speculate on its meaning.

Reader Yu Jisheng wrote: The phrases "graceful conversation and unrestrained expression," "entered a realm of perfection," and "varying in speed" in the July 4 article "Talking About Prose," and the phrase "Han Chao Su Hai" in the July 13 article "Using Ears Instead of Eyes," are indeed difficult to understand. A comrade with a junior high school education had to put down the newspaper and consult a dictionary to understand the allusion "Han Chao Su Hai."

Liu Renci wrote: The general meaning of the article "Please Use 'The Four Books for Women' as a Mirror" on July 5 can certainly be understood, but the several passages of classical Chinese quoted in the article are unreadable. In particular, "xie du" and "zong zi" in "Admonitions for Women" are really incomprehensible; as for the sentence "gnawing rotten red velvet, laughing and spitting at her beloved," one can only speculate on its meaning, understanding it vaguely.

Zhang Shaoying cited the article "'Seriousness' and 'Miscellaneous Learning'" as an example, believing that some of the semi-classical sentences in the article, such as: "The more one knows, the higher one's vision becomes; the more choices one has, the more acute one's ability to distinguish beauty from ugliness and skill from clumsiness becomes. In this way, even if one does not want to think independently, it is impossible," only create reading difficulties for readers with a lower level of education.

The editorial department of this newspaper has received more than one hundred letters from readers expressing similar opinions. These readers all request that the articles in the newspaper be written in a more simple and easy-to-understand manner so that most readers can understand them. Wang Qi said in his letter: "We should not oppose the use of classical allusions in general, but merely using classical allusions is not enough. It is more urgent and necessary to seriously study classical cultural heritage to enrich and create our own language." Chen Zeyan and Liu Renci both hope that authors and editors will consider whether most readers can understand the classical allusions when citing them. If the reader has difficulty understanding and it is necessary to cite them, it is best to make some simple annotations.

Suggest Monitoring Agencies Pay Attention to Cases Exposed in Newspapers

Newspapers reflect the masses' criticisms and suggestions regarding various tasks, and also expose cases of illegal and undisciplined behavior by some staff members. I suggest that monitoring agencies in various regions regularly pay attention to criticisms in the newspapers, especially cases exposed in the newspapers, and urge relevant agencies to handle them, or directly conduct inspections and handle them. In this way, not only can the criticisms in the newspapers achieve better results, but it will also benefit the development of monitoring work.

专栏：读者、作者、编者

    读者、作者、编者
    请把文章写得通俗些读者对副刊文风的意见
    很多读者来信，表示喜欢阅读人民日报第八版的副刊，但是，也有读者认为副刊中有些文章“引经据典过多、过深，不够通俗”；“喜欢用一种半文半白的体裁，爱好晦涩的字眼和冷僻的典故”，读者看不大懂，感到美中不足。
    例如：读者王其来信说：七月二日第八版载“宰相肚皮”一文，引证“易经”中“天下同归而殊涂，一致而百虑”这句话，有好几个具有高中文化程度的同志，都不大了解，只能似是而非地揣测其意。
    读者余寄生来信说：七月四日“话说散文”一文中的“雍容谈笑、纵意挥斥”，“已入化境”，“疾徐有致”；七月十三日“以耳代目之类”一文中的“韩潮苏海”等词句，确实难懂。一个具有初中毕业文化程度的同志，为了弄懂“韩潮苏海”这个典故，不得不放下报纸去查词典。
    刘仁慈来信说：七月五日“请照‘女四书’的镜子”一文，整个的意思当然可以懂得，但是，这篇文章中引用的几段古文，就读不下去了。特别是“女诫”中的“媟黩”、“纵姿”等，实在不知道是什么意思；对“烂嚼红茸，笑向檀郎唾”一句话，也只能揣测其意，似懂非懂。
    张绍英来信，以“‘严肃’和‘杂学’”一文作为例子，认为文中的一些半文半白的句子，如：“所知既富，所见自高，可供较量抉择者越多，辨别妍媸区分巧拙的能力便越是敏锐。这样，虽欲不独立思考，不可得也。”等，只能给那些文化程度不高的读者造成阅读的困难。
    提出类似这种意见的读者来信，本报编辑部已经收到一百多件。这些读者都要求报纸上的文章写得通俗一些，使大多数读者都能看懂。王其在来信中说：“我们不应该一概地反对引经据典，但是仅仅引经据典是不够的。认真学习古典文化遗产，来丰富、创造我们自己的语言，是更加迫切和需要的。”陈则彦和刘仁慈的来信，都希望作者和编者在引经据典的时候，要想一想大多数的读者是否看得懂，如果是读者不容易看懂，而又必要加以引用的，最好作一些简单的注释。
      建议监察机关注意处理在报纸上揭发的案件
    报纸上反映了群众对于各项工作的批评和建议，也揭发了某些工作人员违法乱纪的案件。我建议各地监察机关经常注意报纸上的批评，特别是报纸上揭发的案件，并督促有关机关进行处理，或者直接进行检查处理。这样，不但可以使报纸上的批评得到更好的效果，而且对于监察工作的开展，也有好处。
                            （许之）
