    Unnamed Author: Complete Collection of Essential Matters for Home Use
    Xidi

    Books of this kind, needed by the people for daily life, have existed in many editions throughout history, but they are not easily passed down (we know that there were many in the Song and Yuan dynasties. However, very few from the Tang dynasty and earlier have been preserved). The people need this kind of daily consultant-style encyclopedia. More than twenty years ago, the "Daily Use Encyclopedia" published by the Commercial Press was quite popular. The "Multifunctional Trivial Matters" mentioned last time was one of them. This "Complete Collection of Essential Matters for Home Use" has no author's name – like this kind of book, it is not easy to know the exact author – and is a Jingchang edition from the early Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. It is divided into ten volumes, from A to J. Volume A includes "Learning" and "General Styles for Family Letters," etc. Volume B includes "Family Laws" and "Family Rituals," ending with "Clan Burial Diagram Method." Volume C is "Officialdom," but it includes "Duke of Zhou's Auspicious Days for Travel," "Explanation of Hundreds of Strange Events," and "Dreams and Thoughts," fully demonstrating the "fear of loss" mentality of officials. Volume D is "Residences," including "Good Methods for Husbandry." Volume E is "Agriculture and Sericulture," but it is attached with "Suitable Items for the Study" and "Distinguishing Doubts About Treasures." Volume F includes "Various Types of Tea" to "Wine Starter Types" and "Food and Drink Types." Volume G includes "Food and Drink Types," "Dyeing Types," "Incense Manual," and "Matters for the Ladies' Quarters." Volume H is "Guide to Official Learning." Volume I is "Hygiene," mainly focusing on "Books on Caring for the Elderly" and "Experienced Prescriptions for Treating Various Diseases." Volume J is "Self-Cultivation," mainly focusing on "Book on the Three Primes Assisting Longevity" and "Secret Discussions on Cultivation." Among them, Volumes D, E, F, G, and I are the most relevant to people's livelihood and practical use, very similar to "Multifunctional Trivial Matters." The other five volumes are prepared specifically for officials and scholars, and have little connection with ordinary people. There are many methods of planting, animal husbandry, and brewing, as well as experienced prescriptions for treating various diseases, that can be corroborated and supplemented with "Multifunctional Trivial Matters." "Distinguishing Doubts About Treasures" is a textbook for pawnshops, traditionally passed down in manuscript form. This is the earliest example found in a "printed book." Hu Wenhuan of the Ming Dynasty extracted it from the "Gezhi Congshu" and printed it as a separate book.

    无名氏：居家必用事类全集
    西谛
    像这样一类书，为民间日常所需要的，历代都有不少，惟不易流传下来耳（今所知的，在宋代、元代就有不少部。唐代和唐代以前的却绝少保存下来）。人民是需要这一类日常顾问式的百科全书的。在二十多年前，商务印书馆印的“日用百科全书”就颇受欢迎。上次述的一部“多能鄙事”，也就是其中之一。这部“居家必用事类全集”无撰者姓氏——像这一类的书都是不易知道确实的作者的——是明代万厉初年的经厂刊本。分甲至癸十集。甲集是“为学”和“家书通式”等。乙集是“家法”、“家礼”，末为“族葬图法”。丙集是“仕宦”，却有“周公出行吉日”、“百怪断经”、“梦寐因想”三项包罗在内，足徵仕宦者的“患得患失”的心理。丁集为“宅舍”，并及“牧养良法”。戊集为“农桑类”，却附以“文房适用”、“宝货辨疑”。己集为“诸品茶”以至“酒曲类”、“饮食类”。庚集为“饮食类”、“染作类”、“香谱”、“闺阁事宜”。辛集为“吏学指南”。壬集为“卫生”，以“养老奉亲书”“治诸病经验方”为主。癸集为“谨身”，以“三元参赞延寿之书”及“修养秘论”为主。其中，以丁、戊、己、庚、壬五集为最有关于民生实用，甚类“多能鄙事”。其他五集则专为仕宦和学人们准备的，和老百姓关系不大了。其中有许多种植、牧畜、酿造之法和治诸病的经验良方可与“多能鄙事”相印证相补充。“宝货辨疑”是典当铺的教科书，相传的都是钞本。这却是最早的见于“刻本”里的。明胡文焕刻“格致丛书”，却把它抽出作为一部单行的书印出。
