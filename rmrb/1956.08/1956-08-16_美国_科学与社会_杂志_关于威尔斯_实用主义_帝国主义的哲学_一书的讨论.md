    Discussion of Wells' "Pragmatism—Philosophy of Imperialism"

　　The American journal "Science & Society" published three articles in its fourth issue of 1954 and third issue of 1955, respectively, featuring book reviews and discussions by Horowitz and Cornforth on Harry Wells' "Pragmatism—Philosophy of Imperialism" (the full text has been translated and published in "Translations of Philosophy" No. 2, 1956).

　　Horowitz's book review first affirms that this book is the first detailed and meticulous work to discuss this American philosophy from a Marxist perspective, but expresses doubt about its "theoretical precision and historical accuracy." First, he criticizes Wells for failing to distinguish between the different development processes of American imperialism, treating it as a predetermined plane, and therefore treating pragmatism in the same way. "From Peirce to Dewey, the essential changes in pragmatism doctrine are simply seen as a Machiavellian schemer's conspiracy to make people accept what they originally wanted to reject."

　　Secondly, the author believes that Wells "recognizes that the Russian proletarian revolution seriously influenced the direction taken by pragmatism. ... However, it is not enough to take the view that pragmatism has changed due to this world-shaking event as a basis for obtaining a correct sociological view of pragmatism. Pragmatism should be considered from the perspective of the entire structure of modern American thought." The author believes that "pragmatism rose to fame in opposition to the absolute idealism of the Louisianan aristocracy." Wells did not mention the fierce and sustained struggle of pragmatism against this old-fashioned idealism, as well as the "return to religious morality and idealism" thought trend and its breeders, which are closely related to the hegemony of pragmatism, which is also a defect. Finally, the author mentioned that the rise of fascism has "placed the criticism of pragmatism on the basis that pragmatism can no longer provide an exclusive national doctrine." He said that it would be more beneficial if Wells could examine pragmatism from the perspective of the current social development of the United States.

　　Cornforth disagreed with Horowitz's above opinions. He said that Horowitz's opposition to Wells' main argument seems to be that Wells did not consider the fact that the various schools of pragmatism initially arose from opposition to "absolute idealism," but he believes that "Wells' main contribution lies in his exposing what he calls the 'three-step argument,' according to which pragmatism goes from opposing one form of idealism to re-establishing another form of idealism."

　　Secondly, Cornforth disagreed with Horowitz's criticism of Wells' accusation that pragmatism is a "Machiavellian schemer's conspiracy." He quoted Engels' explanation of the development of ideology in his letter to Franz Mehring, pointing out that "false ideological processes cannot be confused with conscious conspiracies."

　　Cornforth believes that the main shortcoming of Wells' work lies in: "When he explains the imperialist essence of pragmatism philosophy, he did not recognize that such an imperialist philosophy, from the nature of its historical development, contains many 'liberal' elements. Therefore, he did not properly deal with the fact that tens of millions of honest people support pragmatism or other similar philosophies on the progressive side against reactionary forces."

　　Cornforth believes that Horowitz's view that the rise of fascism makes it impossible for pragmatism to propose an exclusive national doctrine is also wrong.

　　Horowitz responded to Cornforth's above criticism.

　　The article first points out that the fact that Marxist scholars hold vastly different views on the issue of making a scientific explanation of pragmatism is due to ignoring the historical position of pragmatism and exposing the one-sidedness of replacing dialectical analysis with mechanical analysis. Therefore, he argues that philosophers must study the social origins and growth of philosophy.

　　He believes that "pragmatism was indeed unconditionally a manifestation of American capitalist culture from 1890 to 1946, but this is no longer the case," and the momentum of pragmatism has declined astonishingly. "The characteristic that once made pragmatism so attractive as a means of promoting expansionist policies has proven very untimely in this era."

　　Horowitz believes that those who study European fascism "know very well the wide range of uses of pragmatism." In order to save the theoretical crisis, fascism always "eclectically selects doctrines that they consider valuable from many philosophies" for their own use. After listing several examples illustrating how reactionary ideas have transformed the ideological system of American society, the author criticizes Wells for failing to consider these phenomena, and Cornforth also exposed his unfamiliarity with the situation in American intellectual circles.

　　The author disagrees with Cornforth's view that the "three-step argument" is Wells' "main contribution" to understanding pragmatism, because in his opinion, "it is already common sense that since Hume, subjective philosophy has gone from the negation of theology to the other extreme of idealism—spiritualism."

　　The author said that he did not say that Wells "accused pragmatism of being a Machiavellian schemer's conspiracy," but only said: Wells "treats pragmatism 'as a Machiavellian schemer's conspiracy' to make people accept what they originally opposed." Here, the author cites some examples from Wells' book to prove that from beginning to end, Wells has added conscious bad behavior to pragmatism that it does not possess.

　　The author expressed agreement with Cornforth's statement that "tens of millions of honest people support pragmatism on the progressive side." He believes that "this sentence, when we study this philosophy, makes it very necessary for us to treat the factors that make many honest American scholars find a home in the halls of pragmatism with as little excited subjectivity as possible and strengthen keen feelings."

### 美国“科学与社会”杂志  关于威尔斯“实用主义—帝国主义的哲学”一书的讨论

    美国“科学与社会”杂志
    关于威尔斯“实用主义—帝国主义的哲学”一书的讨论
　　美国“科学与社会”杂志在1954年第4期、1955年第3期先后发表了霍罗维兹和康福斯对哈利·威尔斯所著“实用主义——帝国主义的哲学”一书的书评和讨论的文章三篇（全文已译载在“哲学译丛”1956年第2期）。
　　霍罗维兹的书评首先肯定这本书是运用马克思主义观点论述这一美国哲学的第一部详尽的精心的作品，但对它的“理论上的精确性与历史上的准确性”却表示怀疑。首先他批评威尔斯不能区别美国帝国主义的不同的发展过程，把它看作是一种既定的平面，因此对实用主义也作了同样的处理，“从皮尔士到杜威，实用主义教义中的本质变化被简单地看成是一种玛基亚维利式的权谋家的阴谋，使人们接受他们原来所要拒绝的东西。”
　　其次，作者认为，威尔斯“认识到俄国无产阶级革命严重地影响了实用主义所采取的方向。……但认为实用主义所发生的变化是由于这一震惊世界的事件，以这种认识为基础，以求获得对实用主义正确的社会学的观点是不够的。实用主义应该放在近代美国思想整个结构的观点上来作考虑。”作者认为，“实用主义是因反对鲁一士底贵族的绝对唯心主义而崛起成名的。”而关于实用主义对这个旧式唯心主义所作的猛烈而持久的斗争以及与实用主义的霸权有密切关系的“回到宗教道德与唯心主义”的思潮及其孕育者，威尔斯都没有提到，也是一个缺陷。最后作者提到法西斯主义的兴起已“使人们对实用主义的批判放在这样的基础上，即实用主义已经不能提供一种独占的国家学说”。他说，威尔斯假如能够从美国现在的社会发展情况来考察实用主义，那将更为有利。
　　康福斯不同意霍罗维兹以上的意见。他说霍罗维兹反对威尔斯的主要论点，好像是说威尔斯没有考虑到实用主义各派学说最初都是从反对“绝对唯心主义起家的这个事实”，但是他认为，“威尔斯的主要贡献正是在于他揭露了他所称呼的‘三步论证’，实用主义就是按照这个‘三步论证’从反对一种形式的唯心主义，走到重新建立另一种形式的唯心主义的”。
　　其次，康福斯不同意霍罗维兹批评威尔斯指责实用主义是一种“玛基亚维利式的权谋家的阴谋”的说法。他引用恩格斯致法朗兹·梅林的信中关于意识形态的发展方式所作的解释指出，“虚假的意识过程不能与有意识的阴谋相混淆”。
　　康福斯认为，威尔斯底著作的主要缺点是在于：“当他说明实用主义哲学的帝国主义本质时，他没有认识到这样一种帝国主义哲学，从它的历史发展的性质本身看来，包含着许多‘自由主义’的因素。因此他没有恰当地处理这样一种事实，那就是千万正直的人们，他们之所以拥护实用主义或其他类似的哲学是站在反对反动势力的进步方面的。
　　康福斯认为，霍罗维兹关于法西斯的兴起使实用主义不可能提出一种独占的国家学说，也是错误的。
　　霍罗维兹对康福斯上述批评，作了答辩。
　　文章首先指出马克思主义学者致力于给实用主义做出科学的说明这个问题上持着大不相同的见解，是由于忽略了实用主义的历史地位，暴露了以机械分析代替辩证分析的片面性的特点。因此他主张哲学家必须研究哲学的社会起源与生长。
　　他认为“实用主义自1890年至1946年确实无条件地是美国资本家文化的表现，但是事情已不再是这样了”，实用主义的声势可惊地衰颓了。“过去曾使实用主义具有如此吸引力的、作为宣传扩张主义政策的一种手段的特点，在这个时代已经被证明非常不合时宜了。”
　　霍罗维兹认为研究欧洲的法西斯主义的人“很懂得实用主义的广泛用途”，法西斯主义为了挽救理论上的危机，它总是“在许多哲学中折衷主义地挑选他们认为有价值的学说”以为己用。在列举几个说明反动思想如何改造美国社会的思想体系的例证以后，作者批评威尔斯对于这些现象没有加以考虑，而康福斯也同样暴露了他对美国思想界情况的不熟悉。
　　作者不同意康福斯认为“三步论证”是威尔斯所提供的理解实用主义的“主要贡献”，因为在他看来“这已经是一种常识，即自休谟以来，主观主义的哲学就已经从对神学的否定走向唯心主义的另一极端——心灵主义。”
　　作者说，他并没有说过威尔斯“指责实用主义是一种玛基亚维利式的权谋家的阴谋。”只是说：威尔斯“把实用主义‘当作一种玛基亚维利式的权谋家的阴谋’，使人们接受他们原来反对的东西。”在这里作者从威尔斯书中举出一些例子证明，自始至终，威尔斯都给实用主义加上它并不具有的有意识的恶劣行为。
　　作者对康福斯所说的“千万正直的人们，他们拥护实用主义是站在进步方面的”一语表示赞同。他认为“这句话，在我们研究这一哲学时，让我们对待那种使得许多美国的正直学者们在实用主义的殿堂里面找到归宿之处的因素，尽可能减少激动的主观、加强敏锐的感觉是非常必要的。”
