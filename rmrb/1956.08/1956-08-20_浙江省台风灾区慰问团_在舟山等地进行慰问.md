Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 18th: The慰問團, composed of people from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province, has conducted extensive慰問 activities in Zhoushan, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, which were heavily affected by the typhoon, for more than a week.

The Zhoushan sub-group of the慰問團, led by Peng Ruilin, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee and head of the sub-group, went to Xiangshan County, the worst-hit area, on the 8th to express their sincere condolences to the affected people and stated that the people of the entire province have sufficient strength to support them in rebuilding their homes and restoring production. Peng Ruilin and others also慰問了 the cadres who had escaped danger and the families of cadres who had heroically sacrificed themselves in the fight against the typhoon.

When Sha Wenhan, head of the慰問團 and Governor of Zhejiang Province, and some members of the团慰問團 visited the Hangyi Agricultural Cooperative and the Jinjia Second Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hangzhou, which were also heavily affected, Governor Sha Wenhan had cordial conversations with the directors and members of these two cooperatives, inquired in detail about the disaster and the restoration of production, and encouraged them to strive to reach last year's output and increase the income of more than 90% of the members.

With gratitude, the慰問團慰問了 the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Zhejiang and the Zhejiang Military Region Command. In this struggle against the typhoon, the troops and the people were always together, and many heroic deeds emerged. In the rescue of the Qiantang River seawall, the troops stationed in Hangzhou rushed to build a seawall of 1,300 meters in length in three days, making a significant contribution to ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the people of Hangzhou. A certain naval unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Zhoushan area braved strong winds and raging waves to scout the disaster situation and rescue victims in Xiangshan, Nanjiushan Island, and Langgangshan, among other places. A certain air force unit airdropped more than 13,000 catties of cooked food to the people trapped by floods in the disaster areas of Xiangshan, Yuhang, and other places.
