    Hurry Up and Give Us Drill Bits
    In December 1955, the Supply Department of the Ministry of Geology allocated 30 Hungarian drilling rigs to our bureau. We were very happy. However, the thought that domestic production does not produce accessories, pipes, and drill bits for this type of drilling rig made us a bit worried. So we reflected this problem to the Ministry, requesting that the Ministry arrange for the production of these drilling materials as soon as possible, and not wait until the last minute. Soon, Section Chief Wang of the Planning Section of the Supply Department called us long distance, notifying us: "The Ministry's Prospecting Plant is responsible for manufacturing 5,000 Hungarian drill bits, to be delivered in the first quarter of 1956." Hearing this news, we were overjoyed, thinking that the higher authorities were solving problems so quickly. Who knew that month after month passed, but the drill bits were nowhere to be seen. In February, I came to Beijing to participate in the ordering conference, only to learn that the production task for this batch of Hungarian drill bits had not yet been assigned. It is said that the reason why it could not be assigned was that the Machinery Department was afraid of disrupting the factory's production plan and was unwilling to accept the task midway. I raised this issue several times in the Supply Department, and it was reflected at the Bureau Director's meeting of the Ministry of Geology in February, and at the Planning Section Chief's meeting of the Ministry of Geology in June. After several months of negotiation, the task was finally assigned. We were very happy again, thinking that this time the problem was finally solved. But we were happy too soon. Who knew that the drill bits produced were not up to specifications. We urgently needed large-diameter drill bits, but the batch of drill bits produced were all small-diameter, completely unusable.
    Due to the lack of drill bits and other drilling materials, eight of these 30 drilling rigs have been shut down. Now it is the third quarter, and whether the production task for this quarter is completed well or not is related to whether the entire annual plan can be completed. We hope that the Ministry of Geology will quickly resolve this problem.

### 快给我们钻头

    快给我们钻头
    1955年12月，地质部供应司拨给我局三十台匈牙利钻机。我们很高兴。但是，一想到国内不生产这种型号的钻机的配件、管材和钻头，也有几分担忧，便把这个问题向部里反映，请部里及早安排这些钻探材料的生产，不要临渴掘井。不久，供应司计划科王科长打长途电话通知我们：“部里的探矿厂负责制造匈式钻头五千个，在1956年一季度交货。”一听到这个消息，我们真是高兴万分，觉得上级机关解决问题真快。谁知时间一月一月地过去了，钻头却迟迟不来。二月份，我到北京来参加订货会议，才知道这批匈牙利钻头的生产任务还没有布置下去。据说布置不下去的原因是机械司怕打乱厂里的生产计划，不肯中途接受任务。我在供应司里把这个问题提了好几次，二月份地质部的局长会议上，六月份地质部计划处长会议上，都有人反映过这个问题。经过几个月的交涉，总算把任务布置下去了。我们心里又很喜欢，以为这一回总算把问题解决了。可是我们高兴得又早了一点。谁知生产出来的钻头偏偏不合乎规格。我们急需大口径钻头，但所生产的这批钻头都是小口径的，根本不能用。
    由于缺乏钻头等钻探材料，这三十部钻机已有八部停下来。现在已是第三季度了，这个季度生产任务完成得好坏，关系到整个年度计划能否完成，希望地质部迅速解决这个问题。
