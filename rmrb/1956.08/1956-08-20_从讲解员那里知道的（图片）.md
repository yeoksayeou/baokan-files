In the Department Store Hall of the "Exhibition of Quality of Daily Industrial Products," the guide introduced the Red Star brand full-fat milk powder manufactured by the Anda Dairy Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Heilongjiang Province, to the audience. This milk powder is produced using modern spray-drying milk dryers. Its solubility is above 97% and its moisture content is below 3%, thus fully preserving the nutritional value of fresh milk and making it one of the best infant milk powders in the country.

This year, the quality of Red Star brand full-fat milk powder produced by the Anda Dairy Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Heilongjiang Province, has reached the level of first-class dairy products in the country. In the first half of this year, the production of Red Star brand full-fat milk powder from this factory was equal to the entire production volume of last year, and the cost was reduced by about half.

In the well-equipped Anda Dairy Factory, workers use vacuum sealing machines to seal cans, which can extend the shelf life to two years.

The pasture has a well-equipped cowshed. The milk yield per cow here this year can reach 3,600 kilograms, an increase of 1,596 kilograms compared to 1948.

The pasture's more than 3,000 hectares of barley have already had a bumper harvest, providing sufficient feed for livestock.

Sun Xizhi, a national youth activist, has many methods for raising dairy cows. The 12 dairy cows he raises have an average milk yield 40% higher than the average milk yield of all the dairy cows on the farm.

The pasture's dairy processing plant is always so busy.

The Red Prairie Pasture transports tens of thousands of kilograms of fresh milk to the local state-owned Anda Dairy Factory every day to be made into milk powder.

The fresh milk used by the dairy factory to manufacture milk powder is mainly supplied by the state-owned Red Prairie Pasture in Anda County. This natural grassland pasture has an area of 151,000 hectares and raises more than 1,800 dairy cows. This year, it can produce more than 5,146,000 kilograms of milk.

Dutch Holstein cows produce the best milk.

Newborn calves, only one month old, have particularly good appetites.

    在“日用工业品质量展览会”百货馆里，讲解员向观众介绍了黑龙江省地方国营安达乳粉厂制造的红星牌全脂奶粉。这种奶粉是用近代喷雾式牛奶烘干机生产的，它的溶解度在97％以上，水分在3％以下，因此充分保持了鲜奶的营养价值，是全国最好的幼儿用奶粉的一种。
    今年，黑龙江地方国营安达乳粉厂生产的红星牌全脂奶粉的质量已经达到了全国乳制品一等品的水平。今年上半年，这个厂生产的红星牌全脂奶粉的产量等于去年全年的生产量，成本也降低了一半左右。
    在设备完善的安达乳粉厂里，工人用真空封口机密封罐头，可以使保管期延长到两年。
    牧场有一座完善的乳牛棚。这里的乳牛今年每头产奶量可达到三千六百公斤，比1948年增加一千五百九十六公斤。

    全国青年积极分子孙锡智饲养乳牛的办法多，他饲养的十二头乳牛比全场乳牛的平均产奶量高40％。
    牧场的乳制品加工厂每天都是那样的忙碌。
    红色草原牧场每天将几万斤的鲜牛奶，运到地方国营安达乳粉厂去制成奶粉。
    乳粉厂制造奶粉用的鲜牛奶，主要是由安达县的国营红色草原牧场供应的。这个天然草原牧场的面积有十五万一千公顷的土地，饲养乳牛一千八百多头，今年可以生产牛奶五百一十四万六千多公斤。
