Recently, many local newspapers have published editorials and articles addressing the issue of trial calculation and distribution for the autumn harvest.

These editorials and articles focus on discussing the importance of the trial calculation and distribution work. The Shanxi Daily's editorial stated: Doing this work well not only allows for the correct implementation of the Party's distribution policies for cooperatives, ensuring increased income for members, but is also a good way to further consolidate cooperatives. The editorials and articles cited many specific facts to illustrate this: the North Jia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huoxian County improved its labor attendance rate from 63.6% to 94.4% due to conducting trial calculation and distribution work relatively well. Four agricultural cooperatives, including Xiahe River and Wangdong, discovered unreasonable expenditures during the trial calculation, tightened expenses that could be saved by 15,000 yuan, and appropriately reduced the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, increasing the proportion distributed to members from 59% of the total income to 66.5%. After detailed trial calculations, Cao Sanquan and Shang Dalin, and other six cooperatives, calculated that 7.87% of households might experience reduced income. Therefore, the cooperative appropriately arranged jobs for them according to their labor strength and technical expertise, thereby ensuring that these households did not experience reduced income. Yunnan Daily published an editorial titled "Every Agricultural Production Cooperative Should Conduct Trial Calculation and Distribution." In a paragraph discussing why trial calculation and distribution is needed, it stated: From the perspective of the entire province, about two-thirds of the total number of cooperative members have not participated in the autumn harvest distribution. After joining the cooperative, they are very concerned about whether their personal income can increase. Also, some agricultural cooperatives did not provide sufficient care for members during last year's autumn harvest distribution, with excessive cooperative retention, which also made some members afraid that this would happen again this year. Many cooperative cadres have high confidence in this year's increased production and income, but they are not sure whether they can achieve the increased production target or complete the income plan. These members and cooperative cadres all hope to understand the agricultural cooperative's operating situation, distribution ratio, and so on. This legitimate request of theirs should be satisfied.

These editorials and articles criticized some deviations in the trial calculation and distribution work. The Yunnan Daily's editorial pointed out: Some people regard trial calculation and distribution simply as a technical task of planning and accounting, so only the accountant and the cooperative's main cadres calculate accounts behind closed doors, without mobilizing the masses or combining it with improving production and improving management. This approach is very wrong. Local experiences have proven that every agricultural cooperative will encounter many specific management and production issues when conducting trial calculation and distribution. Without solving these problems, there is no way to complete the trial calculation, and even if it is calculated, it is not reliable; if accounts are not cleared and costs are not calculated, it is impossible to calculate the result. The editorial also focused on criticizing the erroneous practice of not relying on cooperative members: some agricultural cooperatives leave the trial calculation and distribution work at the level of cooperative cadres, and only after calculating the accounts do they convene a meeting of cooperative member representatives to announce the remuneration that each work-day may receive. Although this can play a certain role in encouraging people, because members did not participate in the entire process of trial calculation and distribution, especially without calculating accounts for each household specifically, not only can many difficult problems not be solved, but it is also difficult to calculate accurately. The Dalian Daily published an article titled "Why Was the Trial Calculation and Distribution Work of the 'Red October' Agricultural Cooperative Not Done Well?" which also criticized the erroneous practice of calculating accounts behind closed doors. The trial calculation and distribution work of this cooperative ended as early as mid-July. The cooperative cadres said: after trial calculation, a work-day can get 1.89 yuan, and 92.13% of the members can increase their income. Judging from these figures, the situation is still good. However, these figures did not play any role in encouraging the members. Many members did not believe this trial calculation and distribution plan; some members did not even know how the distribution would be done. It turned out that this plan was calculated behind closed doors by a few cadres in the office.

### 作好试算试分

    作好试算试分
    最近许多地方报纸上针对秋收分配的试算试分问题，发表了不少社论和文章。
    这些社论和文章着重论述了试算试分工作的重要性。山西日报的社论中说：做好这一工作，不仅可以正确地贯彻执行党对合作社的分配政策，保证社员增加收入，而且是进一步巩固合作社的好办法。社论和文章中举出了许多具体事实加以说明：崞县北贾村农业生产合作社由于较好地进行了试算试分工作，劳动出勤率由63.6％提高到94.4％。下合河和王董等四个农业合作社在试算中，发现了开支还有不合理现象，紧缩了能够节省的费用一万五千元，并适当少扣了公积金和公益金，使分给社员的比例，由总收入的59％增加到66.5％。曹三泉和上大林等六个社详细试算后，算出有7.87％的户可能减少收入，于是社里就按照他们的劳力强弱和技术特长，适当地给安排了营生，从而保证了这些户不减少收入。云南日报以“每个农业生产合作社都应进行试算试分”为题，发表社论。在论述为什么需要进行试算试分的一段中说：从全省来看，没有参加过秋收分配的社员约占社员总数的三分之二，他们在入社以后，对于个人收入能不能增加非常关心。还有些农业合作社在去年秋收分配的时候对社员照顾不够，社留部分过多，也使得有些社员怕今年仍然是这样。许多社干部对今年增产和增加收入虽然信心很高，但是对于能否达到增产指标、能否完成收入计划却没有底。这些社员和社干部都希望弄清楚农业社的经营情况，分配比例等等。应当满足他们的这个正当要求。
    这些社论和文章批判了试算试分工作中的一些偏向。云南日报的社论中指出：有些人把试算试分单纯当作打算盘算账的技术工作，因而只由会计和社的主要干部闭门算账，既不发动群众，也不和改进生产、改进经营管理等工作结合。这种做法是很不对的。各地经验证明：各个农业合作社在进行试算试分的时候，都会遇到许多经营管理和生产上的具体问题，不解决这些问题就没有办法试算到底，即使算出来也不可靠；如果不清理账目、核算成本，就不可能算出结果来。社论中也着重批判了不依靠社员群众的错误做法：有些农业合作社，把试算试分工作停留在社干部一层，算出账后才召开社员代表大会宣布每个劳动日可能得到的报酬。这样做，虽然也能起一定的鼓舞作用，但是由于社员没有参加试算试分的整个过程，特别是没有家家具体算账，不但很多疑难问题解决不了，而且也难算得准确。旅大日报发表的题为“红十月农业社的试算试分工作为何未做好？”的文章中，也批判了关门算账的错误做法。这个社的试算试分工作，早在七月中旬就结束了，社干部说：经过试算，一个劳动日可得一元八角九分，92.13％的社员都能增加收入。从这些数字来看，情况还好。但是，这些数目字对社员并没有起一点鼓舞作用。许多社员都不相信这个试算试分方案；有的社员连怎样分配还不知道。原来这个方案只是几个干部在办公室闭门算出来的。
