After Thorough Propaganda and Full Preparation

Hunan Province's Advanced Agricultural Cooperativization Movement Will be Fully Unfolded

(Our report) This autumn harvest season, Hunan Province will realize advanced forms of agricultural cooperativization. As of early August, the first batch of 9,700 cooperatives in 40 counties and cities have fully launched the work of merging and upgrading, of which 3,300 cooperatives have already or are in the process of handling specific economic issues.

Before the work of merging and upgrading was launched, the Party committees at all levels in the province had made full preparations. In addition to carefully formulating cooperative establishment plans, all counties universally trained key personnel, conducted in-depth publicity on the specific policies of advanced cooperativization, combined with summarizing the advantages of local advanced cooperatives, and deeply educated farmers. The People's Committees of each county, based on the ideological situation of the local masses, widely issued announcements regarding the handling of specific economic issues after advanced cooperativization. The rural work departments of the provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees all conducted pilot work on the merging and upgrading of one or two cooperatives in order to gain experience and guide the overall work. In late July, the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department also convened a symposium on advanced cooperativization pilot projects in various regions, summarizing the experiences and problems in merging and upgrading.

On the basis of the basic completion of the preparation work for merging and upgrading, according to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions, it is generally planned to carry out the merging and upgrading work in August and September. In order to ensure that the merging and upgrading work does not affect the current production and distribution, all localities have made arrangements to closely integrate these three tasks according to specific circumstances. For example, in areas severely affected by drought, drought resistance production is the main focus; in areas with later-season intermediate rice, the work of merging and upgrading is accelerated, but only the framework is set up and various economic issues are handled, while the production of existing crops and autumn miscellaneous crops is still managed by the original cooperatives. Based on the pilot projects and the current unfolding of the merging and upgrading work, attention is paid to emphasizing ideological mobilization, strengthening production leadership, and properly arranging key personnel to ensure the healthy development of the movement.

    经过深入宣传充分准备
    湖南省高级合作化运动将全面铺开
    本报讯　今年秋收前后，湖南全省将实现高级形式的农业合作化。截至八月上旬为止，已有四十个县、市第一批九千七百个社的并社升级工作全面铺开，其中三千三百个社已经或正在处理具体经济问题。
    在并社升级工作展开之前，这个省的各级党委曾进行了充分的准备工作。除认真作好建社规划外，各县普遍训练了骨干，深入开展高级合作化的具体政策宣传，结合总结当地高级社的优越性，深入教育农民，各县人民委员会根据当地群众思想情况，广泛发布了高级化后有关具体经济问题处理的布告。省、地、县各级党委农村工作部都作了一、二个社的并社升级试点工作，以便取得经验，指导全面。七月下旬，省委农村工作部还召开了各地委有关高级合作化试点座谈会，总结了并社升级中的经验和问题。
    在并社升级准备工作大体完成的基础上，根据省委指示精神，一般都计划在八、九月份进行并社升级工作。为使并社升级工作不影响当前的生产和分配，各地都根据具体情况，把三项工作紧密结合加以安排。如旱灾严重的地区以抗旱生产为主，季节较晚的中稻区抓紧并社升级工作，但只搭好架子、处理各种经济问题，至于现有作物和秋杂作物的生产，仍由原来的社经营。根据试点和目前铺开的并社升级工作，注意强调思想发动、加强生产领导，并妥善安排骨干，保证运动的健康发展。
