Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 25th: Agricultural cooperatives in the flood-stricken areas of Henan Province are taking various measures to drain standing water and rush to plant late autumn crops.

Comrades in Shangshui County took advantage of the river water receding to newly build and repair 520 new and old drainage ditches, rapidly diverting the internal waterlogging into the river. They also dug ditches at the edge of the fields to drain accumulated water. In the Xuchang area, more than 110,000 people from Fugou, Lin'ying, and Wuyang counties participated in drainage, clearing 570,000 mu of waterlogged land in seven days. In the Xinxiang area, the waterlogging in Yuanyang, Qinyang, Xiuwu, Wenxian, and Fengqiu counties was drained by the 15th.

All localities are adhering to the spirit of "drain and plant immediately," overcoming all difficulties to carry out emergency planting in a timely manner. In Shangcai County, Xinyang area, where there was a lot of grass, the seeds were simply dropped into the furrows plowed by plows. In Jiantun Township, Weishi County, the water had just been drained, and there was silt in the fields, making it impossible for livestock and carts to enter to deliver manure and plow the land. People carried manure and pulled plows to rush to plant. By the 18th, more than 4,000 mu of late autumn crops such as buckwheat, turnips, and radishes had been planted. In Ji County, Xinxiang area, farmers who couldn't get into the newly drained fields tied boards to their feet and went in to rush to plant.

In order to support the farmers' rush planting efforts, the government vigorously transferred, supplied, and loaned late autumn crop seeds. The Xinxiang Administrative Office transferred more than 128,000 jin of rapeseed from Jiyuan and Meng Counties to Huojia, Xiuwu, Qinyang, Bo'ai, Yuanyang, Fengqiu, and Wuzhi counties. Xuchang and Xinyang areas also vigorously tapped the potential for seeds, relying on the masses to solve the shortage of buckwheat and vegetable late autumn crop seeds.

The friendly assistance from non-disaster areas to disaster areas has also accelerated the speed of rush planting in disaster areas. After the Xinyang area's Huangchuan, Gushi and other counties convened a meeting of agricultural cooperative directors from disaster and non-disaster areas, 95 townships and 158 cooperatives in non-disaster areas drew 16,000 laborers and 850 livestock to help more than 90 riverside low-lying townships rush to plant various late autumn crops on more than 57,500 mu.

    河南水灾区排水抢种晚秋
    新华社郑州25日电　河南省水灾区农业社采取各种办法排除积水，抢种晚秋。
    商水县农业社社员们乘河水落的机会，新修和修理新、老排水沟五百二十道，迅速地把内涝积水往河里引，还在地头挖沟排蓄积水。许昌专区扶沟、临颍、舞阳三县参加排水的十一万多人，在七天内排除积水五十七万亩。新乡专区原阳、沁阳、修武、温县、封丘等县的积水在15日前就排完了。
    各地都根据随排随种的精神，克服一切困难及时进行抢种。信阳专区上蔡县对草多不好种的地，就把种籽丢在用犁串了的沟里。尉氏县简屯乡的积水刚排出，地里有淤泥，牲口和车不能进去送粪和犁地，就由人担粪、拉犁抢种，到18日已经种上荞麦、蔓菁、萝卜等晚秋作物四千多亩。新乡专区汲县农民因刚排了水的地进不去，就在脚底下绑了板进去抢种。
    为了支援农民的抢种工作，政府大力调运、供应、贷放了晚秋作物种籽。新乡专署从济源、孟县调出油菜籽十二万八千多斤给获嘉、修武、沁阳、博爱、原阳、封丘、武陟等县。许昌、信阳两专区还大力发掘种籽潜力，依靠群众解决了荞麦、蔬菜晚秋作物种籽不足的困难。
    非灾区对灾区的友爱帮助，也加速了灾区抢种的速度。信阳专区潢川、固始等县召开了灾区和非灾区的农业社主任会议以后，非灾区有九十五个乡一百五十八个社抽出一万六千多个劳动力，八百五十头牲口，帮助九十多个沿河洼地乡抢种各种晚秋作物五万七千五百多亩。
