    A Commune Member's Words
    Huang Xiangqing
    The Shui'nan Township Agricultural Cooperative (Han ethnicity cooperative) is a well-run key cooperative in Yai County, Guangdong, and one of the top cooperatives in the Hainan Administrative Region. After the wheat harvest, a commune member from this cooperative went to Tongshi, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, for some business. By chance, he met Minister Yang from the Rural Work Department of the prefectural committee. They didn't exchange names and just chatted casually.

    "How was the early rice harvest?" the minister asked.

    "Ha! An unusually good harvest, increased production, the advanced cooperative is really good," the commune member said excitedly. "If the cadres were willing to listen to us, the production increase would be even greater."

    "Why?"

    "The rice had already headed, and it looked like the fertilizer was sufficient, but the cadres insisted on adding fertilizer for the third time. The commune members said it wasn't necessary and that adding more would cause lodging. But the cadres said we were clinging to old experiences and were backward. They also said that we were a key cooperative and had a plan to add fertilizer three times, and not completing it would have a bad impact. So, they forced each team to add fertilizer three times. After the fertilizer was added, the rice grew too vigorously, and as it grew, it really did lodge. Only two-thirds of it produced grain, and we harvested about 500 jin per mu. Some of the teams that secretly resisted and didn't add fertilizer generally harvested 700 jin, and some even reached 1,000 jin."

    Then he talked about planting mung beans and digging wells. He said, "This year when digging wells, everyone said that there was no water in many places and we shouldn't dig, but the cadres insisted on digging 1,000 wells. In the end, the number was enough, but many wells were dug in vain, wells without water!"

    This commune member seemed a bit emotional, and he said: "Now it's less and less like before, everything is imposed without explanation. Once, when discussing the distribution problem, everyone raised a lot of opinions, but the resident cadre got anxious and asked everyone: 'Do you want to take the socialist road, or the capitalist road?' After hearing that, no one said anything more, and soon they quietly dispersed."

    "You are a key cooperative, doesn't the higher level often send cadres there? Have you ever reflected your opinions to them?" the minister asked.

    "Yes, the county committee and district committee often come, but when they come, they only find cadres to hold meetings and listen to the cadres' reports, we can't even see them. Even if they find us, they don't ask us these things, the higher-level comrades only like to hear cadres report achievements."

    After talking for a while, Minister Yang walked out. Another person said to the commune member: "Do you know who he is? The prefectural committee's minister." Hearing this, the commune member hurriedly rushed out the door and nervously said to the minister: "I was just talking casually, please don't say it was me who said it."

    This young peasant only spoke these words because he didn't know that this casually dressed, peasant-like person was a minister.

    Why doesn't he dare to casually talk to the cadres about his own opinions?

    一个社员的话
    黄向青
    水南乡农业社（汉族社）是广东崖县办得较好的重点社，在海南行政区也是数得上的头等社。麦收后，这个社有个社员因事到自治州首府通什来，一个偶然的机会，跟地委农村工作部的羊部长碰在一块，彼此没有通名道姓，就随随便便聊起天来。
    “早造收成怎样呀？”部长问。
    “哈！少有的丰收，增产了，高级社就是好。”社员兴奋地说：“如果干部肯听我们的话，增产还会更多呢。”
    “为什么？”
    “禾已抽了穗，看来肥力也足够，干部们硬要叫追第三次肥，社员说不用追了，再追反会倒伏的。干部们却说我们死抱旧经验、落后。还说我们是重点社，订了追三次肥的计划，不完成影响不好。结果就硬布置各队追三次肥。追了肥的禾开始旺极了，长着长着真的倒伏了，只有三分之二结实，每亩收了五百斤左右。我们那个队有些暗地抗着没有追的，一般却收获七百斤，有些还达到一千斤。
    接着他又谈到种绿豆问题，打井问题，他说：“今年打井，有许多地点大家说没有水不能打，但干部非要打够一千个不行。最后数目是够了，可是许多井却是白打，有井没水！”
    这个社员好像有些感慨，他说：现在愈来愈不像以前了，什么事都不由分说。有一次讨论分配问题，大家提了很多意见，驻社干部着了急，就问大家：“你们要走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？”大家听了谁也不再说什么，一会就悄悄地散了。
    “你们是重点社，上级不是常有干部去吗？有没有向他们反映反映？”部长问。
    “是倒是，县委、区委都常常来，可是他们一来就是找干部开会，听干部汇报，我们见也见不到。即使找我们，也不问我们这些话，上级同志只欢喜听干部报成绩”。
    话谈过了一阵，羊部长走了出去，另外一个人对这个社员说：“你知道他是谁？地委的部长。”这个社员听了，急急赶出门来，紧张地对部长说：“刚才我只是随便说说，可不要说是我说的。”
    这个青年农民，由于不知道这个衣着随便、庄稼汉模样的人是个部长，才说了这些话。
    他为什么不敢随便和干部谈他自己心里这些意见呢？
