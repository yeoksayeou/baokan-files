	The Quality of These Products Has Improved

	Yantai Clock and Watch Factory's Clocks

	The famous Yantai clocks have returned to their original quality level. They were rated as first-class products at the National Light Industry Products Exhibition.

	The Yantai Clock and Watch Factory has been working to restore the quality of its famous brand for four months. The relevant leading authorities and all the factory's employees have made great efforts.

	To ensure product quality, many parts of the clocks are made of high-quality raw materials. Based on standard samples, formal technical standards have been established, and various parts and components have become more precise, with certain tolerance dimensions, changing the past problems such as "walking when standing, not walking when lying down." Product inspection before leaving the factory has also been tightened. The timekeeping test has been changed from one day and one night to four days and four nights. Spot checks are also conducted before leaving the factory to strictly prohibit substandard products from leaving the factory.

	Currently, the factory is experimenting with using stainless steel to replace the current medium carbon steel for the balance staff. If successful, the lifespan of the clock can be extended to more than ten years. The factory is also preparing to trial-produce clocks that are inexpensive, attractive, accurate, and do not require daily winding. (Dazhong Daily)

	Xuzhou Glass Factory's Thermos Bottles

	The quality of bamboo-shell thermos bottles produced by the Xuzhou Joint State-Private Glass Factory in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, has recently improved significantly.

	Since the Xuzhou Glass Factory was established in 1954, due to the increase in people's purchasing power, bamboo-shell thermos bottles were once in short supply. The factory leaders then developed the business idea of "not washing the mud off the radishes when they are harvested quickly"; the workers also did not pay enough attention to product quality. Therefore, the quality of the bamboo-shell thermos bottles produced by this factory was very poor. The main shortcomings were: insufficient insulation performance, high explosion rate, serious waste and defective products, and defects such as crooked mouths and bottoms. In 1955, the average first-class product rate of this factory was only 6.6%. Consumers called the factory's thermos bottles "cold water bottles" and "time bombs."

	In January of this year, after the factory was approved for joint state-private ownership, the production enthusiasm of the workers greatly increased. In March, the factory launched a high-quality product campaign. All employees further realized the relationship between the quality of products and national construction, the worker-peasant alliance, enterprise reputation, the factory's own development, and the immediate interests of the employees, and began to pay attention to product quality. In terms of enterprise management, a post-work waste product analysis system and a product quality inspection system were also established, the operating procedures were revised, and the unreasonable wage system of "only paying attention to quantity and not quality" was reformed. Therefore, the quality of thermos bottles gradually improved, and the first-class product rate increased from 33.19% in the first quarter to 74.97% in the second quarter. Defects such as crooked mouths, crooked bottoms, silver detachment, and uneven weight of thermos bottles were also reduced. The explosion rate of thermos bottles also dropped from about four per thousand in 1955 to about four per ten thousand in the first half of this year.

	After the National Glass Industry Quality Appraisal in June, the factory further promoted the "vacuum rapid operation method," and the insulation performance of the thermos bottles exceeded the national standards. The first-class product rate increased from 74.97% in the second quarter to 87.54% in July.

	Currently, the factory is also actively researching and experimenting with new varieties and designs of thermos bottles, and is formulating a comprehensive plan for the next five months to promote advanced experience, focusing on product quality issues. (Sun Jiliang)

    这些产品的质量提高了
    烟台钟表厂的钟表
    著名的烟台钟表，质量已经恢复到原来的水平。在全国轻工业产品展览会上，被评为一等产品。
    烟台钟表厂恢复名牌货质量的工作已进行了四个月。有关领导机关和这个厂的全体职工都作了很大的努力。
    为了保证产品质量，钟表上的很多零件都采用了质量好的原料制作；在标准样品的基础上，又制定了正规的技术标准，各种零、配件更精密了，有了一定的公差尺寸，改变了过去那种站着走躺着不走等毛病。产品出厂检验也严格了，对表时间由过去一天一夜改为四天四夜，出厂时还要抽查，严禁次品出厂。
    目前这个厂正在试验用不锈钢代替现在的中炭钢作摆尖。成功后，钟表的寿命可延长到十年以上。这个厂还在准备试制又便宜、又好看、又准确、还不用天天上弦的钟表。　　　（大众日报）
    徐州玻璃厂的热水瓶
    江苏省徐州市公私合营徐州玻璃厂，最近所生产的竹壳热水瓶质量有了显著的改进。
    徐州玻璃厂自从1954年建厂以来，由于人民购买力的提高，竹壳热水瓶曾一度供不应求，厂的领导人员便产生了“萝卜快了不洗泥”的经营思想；职工群众对产品质量也不够重视。因此，这个厂出产的竹壳热水瓶质量很差。主要的缺点是：保暖性能不够，爆炸率较高，废次品严重，外形有歪口歪底等毛病。1955年这个厂平均一等品率只有6.6％。消费者称这个厂的热水瓶为“冷水瓶”、“定时炸弹”。
    今年一月，这个厂被批准公私合营后，职工群众的生产积极性大大提高。三月份，这个厂开展了优良产品质量运动，全体职工进一步认识到产品质量的好坏，对国家建设、工农联盟、企业信誉和工厂本身的发展以及职工切身利益的关系，开始重视产品质量。在企业管理方面，也建立了工后会的废品分析制度和产品质量检验制度，修订了操作规程，改革了“只按数量不管质量”的不合理的工资制度。因此，热水瓶质量逐步提高，一等品率由第一季度的33.19％提高到第二季度的74.97％；热水瓶口歪、底歪、脱银及轻重不匀等毛病也减少了；热水瓶的爆炸率也由1955年的千分之四左右降为今年上半年的万分之四左右。
    在六月份全国玻璃工业质量评比以后，这个厂又推广“真空快速操作法”，热水瓶的保暖程度超过了国家规定的标准；一等品率又由第二季度的74.97％提高到七月份的87.54％。
    目前，这个厂又在积极研究试验热水瓶的新品种新花样，并且正在针对产品质量上的问题制定下半年五个月推广先进经验的全面规划。
