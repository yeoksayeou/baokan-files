Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Damascus Dispatch: The chairman of the Oil Workers Labor Union in Deir ez-Zor, eastern Syria, stated on August 5th that if "imperialist countries take any action against Egypt," the oil workers will prohibit oil from flowing through Syria.

The statement said: The Western countries' demand to internationalize the Suez Canal proves their imperialist ambitions. The statement pointed out: "Any act of aggression attempting to force Egypt to accept this demand will be regarded as an action against the entire Arab nation."

The statement calls on all Syrian oil workers to "prepare for a national struggle to support Egypt in nationalizing the Suez Canal."

Prior to this, oil workers in Hama, central Syria, also expressed that if Western countries attack Egypt, they would stop oil from flowing through.

According to Western news agencies, the British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company transports approximately 25 million tons of Iraqi oil annually through its three pipelines across Syrian territory; the American-owned Arabian Oil Company transports 325,000 barrels of Saudi Arabian oil daily through a pipeline in Syrian territory.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Damascus Dispatch: The "Al-Alam" newspaper today quoted a military spokesman as saying, "The Syrian army, like the government and the people, believes that Syria and Egypt share the same fate, and our survival and future are completely linked to the survival and future of Egypt." He said: Syria will "mobilize all its military forces to prepare for any eventuality that may occur."

"Al-Alam" also said that the Syrian cabinet met last night to discuss the mobilization measures taken by the Chief of Staff. After the cabinet meeting, the Ministry of Defense issued a statement saying: "Syria is preparing and will help Egypt and fight alongside it to the end."

    新华社6日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚东部的德尔艾尔佐尔的石油工人劳工联合会主席在八月五日发表声明说，万一“帝国主义国家对埃及采取任何行动的话”，石油工人们将禁止石油流过叙利亚。
    这项声明说：西方国家要求把苏彝士运河国际化，证明了帝国主义的野心。声明指出：“任何企图强迫埃及接受这个要求的侵略行动将被认为是针对整个阿拉伯国家的行动”。
    声明要求叙利亚所有的石油工人“准备进行全国斗争来支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有”。
    在这以前，叙利亚中部的哈马的石油工人也曾经表示，如果西方国家攻击埃及的话，他们要阻止石油流过。
    据西方通讯社报道，在叙利亚，英国人的伊拉克石油公司每年通过它的三条横贯叙利亚领土的油管要运出约二千五百万吨的伊拉克石油；美国人的阿拉伯油管公司每天要通过叙利亚领土上的一条油管运出三十二万五千桶沙特阿拉伯的石油。
    新华社6日讯　大马士革消息：“旗帜报”今天引述一位军方发言人的话说，“叙利亚军队，正像政府和人民一样，认为叙利亚和埃及是命运相同的，我们的生存和前途完全同埃及的生存和前途联结在一起”。他说：叙利亚将“动员它的一切军事力量来准备应付任何万一会发生的事情”。
    “旗帜报”还说，叙利亚内阁昨天晚上开会讨论了参谋长所采取的动员措施。在内阁开会后，国防部发表声明说：“叙利亚正在准备着，它将帮助埃及，并且同它并肩作战到底。”
