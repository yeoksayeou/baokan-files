Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 20th: The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Kunming has, since mid-July, been conducting a general inspection and inventory of draught animals and farm tools by production team in order to prepare for the autumn harvest and planting.

Before the spring plowing this year, the cooperative assigned draught animals and farm tools to the teams and implemented a cost-contracting system. However, because there was insufficient consultation with the members at the time, the contracted costs were not entirely reasonable. As a result, for more than half a year, members have not been careful enough in the use of farm tools and draught animals, and management has not been strict. For example, Team One took manure buckets from Team Nine and returned them to Team Seven after use. Team Twelve had two waterwheels left in the fields unattended; Team Eleven picked them up, but the leader of the team that lost the waterwheels insisted that they were not from their team. During this inspection, it was discovered that farm tools worth more than 2,390 yuan were lost or damaged due to this lack of dedicated management and improper use. There were also many unreasonable phenomena in the use of animal power. Team Six transferred strong horses to grind flour, some horses have been idle since joining the cooperative, while some teams lacked horses to carry manure and had to carry it on their backs.

In conjunction with the inspection, each team classified and numbered more than 1,000 farm tools, such as double-wheeled double-share plows, walking plows, and waterwheels, assessed the condition of the farm tools and their future service life, and registered them in detail. At the same time, the cooperative's management committee organized the draught animal and farm tool managers from each team to visit Team Seven, which had not damaged a single farm tool in the past six months, to learn Team Seven's methods of preserving farm tools. After inspecting the draught animals, appropriate adjustments were made to the animal power between the teams, some unqualified keepers were replaced, and the excessively low work points for feeding were increased. The cooperative also disposed of the 53 surplus old horses from each team by returning them to members or selling them to members, based on the principles of reducing the cooperative's burden and benefiting the members' household sideline occupations. Through the inspection, each team also identified the farm tools they were still short of and planned to add some more before the autumn harvest and planting.

    检查耕畜农具迎接秋收秋种
    新华社昆明20日电　昆明郊区先锋农业社自七月中旬以来，以生产队为单位普遍进行了对耕畜农具的检查清理工作，以迎接秋收秋种。
    这个社，在今年春耕前曾经将耕畜、农具搭配给队，实行成本包干，但由于当时在社员中酝酿得不够，包干成本不完全合理。因此，半年多来，社员对农具、耕畜的使用不够爱护，管理也不严格。如一队挑走九队的粪桶，用后还给七队；十二队有两张水车丢在田里无人过问，十一队拾回来，丢了水车的队长还硬说不是他们队的。在这次检查中发现，因这种缺乏专人管理和使用不当而丢失、损坏的农具，价值达二千三百九十多元。在畜力的使用上也存在许多不合理的现象。六队把强壮的大马调去磨面，有的马入社至今闲养着，而有些队却缺乏马匹驮粪，只好用人力去背。
    结合检查，各队将双轮双铧犁、步犁、水车等一千多件农具逐件分类编号，评出农具的新旧程度及今后使用年限，详细登记列册。社务管理委员会同时组织各队耕畜、农具管理员到半年来没有损坏一件农具的第七队去参观，学习七队保管农具的方法。在检查耕畜后，各队与队之间的畜力进行了适当的调整，对某些不称职的饲养员进行了调换，过低的饲养工分也进行了提高。合作社又将各队多余的五十三匹老马，根据减轻社的负担和对社员开展家庭副业有利的原则，作了退回或出卖给社员等处理。通过检查，各队还缺少的农具，准备在秋收秋种前再添置一部分。
