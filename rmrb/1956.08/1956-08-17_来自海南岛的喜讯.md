    Good News from Hainan Island
    Preparing for Deep-Sea Fishing
    More than 1,100 large fishing boats with a capacity of 600 dan or more along the coast of Hainan Island are preparing for long voyages, planning to develop deep-sea fishing operations when the autumn fishing season arrives this year. Most of these boats are equipped with radios, and some are also equipped with engines and light fishing devices.
    This deep-sea operation is the largest in scale since the liberation of Hainan Island. The Xisha Islands fishing ground is one of the planned operating areas. In the past, fishermen only collected bird droppings, sea cucumbers, seaweed, and shellfish there. This time, they plan to catch high-value fish such as red fish and snapper.

    Canning Factory Starts Production
    The newly established local state-owned Haikou Canning Factory has begun production. The first batch of products is canned Hainan pineapple, which has been ordered and is awaiting shipment abroad.
    Hainan Island, located in the tropics, produces many fruits, and pineapple is one of the most famous, with an annual output of about 110,000 to 120,000 dan for the entire island. In the past, because pineapples were not easy to store, not many were transported and sold to other places. Now, with this cannery, more people at home and abroad can eat this sweet, juicy, and fragrant fruit.
      Currently, it is the pineapple harvest season. In the factory's preparation workshop, pineapples are piled up inside and outside. After being cut and placed in cans, these pineapples are transported to an automatic vacuum sealing machine via a conveyor belt. Then, busy cranes send baskets of canned goods to the sterilization tank. Canned pineapples manufactured in this way can be preserved for one year, and the fresh and delicious taste of the pineapple remains unchanged. Since production began in May, the daily output has reached 25,000 cans.
    After the pineapple processing season is over, in addition to manufacturing various canned meats, this factory will also use Hainan Island's special product, coconut, to manufacture canned "Jiaga". This is a kind of sugar sauce made from coconut and eggs. Now, according to the requirements of the Food Export Company, a batch of samples has been rushed out. (Zeng Shan)
    Abundant Tanning Resources
    Among the valuable timber forests of Hainan Island, there are a large number of tannin crops that can be utilized. Tannin is an important industrial raw material for leather making and dyeing. There are many crops in the world that can be used for extraction, but the types produced in the tropics are the most numerous and of the best quality. At present, among the tannin crops on Hainan Island, mangroves have the highest value. Some tree species contain about 23% or more tannins. Test results show that the leather produced has a bright color, soft texture, and elasticity. These mangroves grow in mudflats at the intersection of the sea and rivers and in areas where the wind and waves are relatively calm, with the largest concentration along the northern and eastern coasts.
    There are also eight types of trees on the island, such as Phyllanthus emblica, Albizia lebbeck, and Acacia confusa, whose bark contains less than 16% tannins. Most of them have never been used. More common tannin crops such as Dioscorea cirrhosa, Dioscorea alata, and Canarium album are produced everywhere, and local product companies purchase thousands of dan every year. According to the natural conditions of Hainan Island, other advanced tannin crops can also be introduced in the future.

    Marching Towards Wasteland
    Since the spring of this year, the original and newly built thirty-four state-owned reclamation farms and mechanical farms on Hainan Island have actively carried out a campaign to march towards wasteland, and in the first quarter alone, they have reclaimed more than 61,600 mu of wasteland.
    In order to expand the planting area of tropical and subtropical cash crops and support national industrial construction, it is planned to reclaim another 220,000 mu on the basis of the original more than 400,000 mu this year. The crops planted will be greatly increased. For example, the area of sisal hemp will be more than five times that of last year, and the area of citronella grass will be four times more than the number planted in the previous three years. The survival rate of newly planted citronella grass has increased from 50% last year to 95%. (Zeng Shan, Li Qilong)
    Moving from the Mountains to the Plains
    The large-scale relocation of the Miao people scattered in the high mountains and ridges of the Wuzhi Mountain area is about to begin. This large-scale relocation of more than 1,000 households and more than 5,000 people will be completed before November this year. From then on, all more than 2,300 Miao compatriots in the entire Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture will be free from the environment of miasma and wild animals, come to the plains at the foot of the mountain, and develop production and live a prosperous life together with people of all ethnic groups.
    In order to help the Miao compatriots move, the People's Committee of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture decided to allocate 100,000 yuan as immigration expenses. The Li people living at the foot of the mountain have also selected places with better natural environments and built a large number of new houses and opened up many new villages with the consent of the Miao compatriots, waiting for them to move down.
    The Miao people of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture were oppressed and massacred by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. In order to survive, they had to flee to the remote mountains and ridges. They had no plows or farm tools and only relied on planting a little "Shanlan" (slope rice) and hunting by primitive methods, and their lives were very poor. Since the establishment of the autonomous prefecture in 1952, the Party and the People's Government have helped them move down the mountain in batches. In the past few years, 5,973 people have been relocated down the mountain. (Zhang Xiaode)
    Movies Enter the Deep Mountains
    The Li and Miao people living in the remote Wuzhi Mountain area have more and more opportunities to watch movies. Since this year, the people in Tongshi District of Baoting County can see a movie on average once every month or so. The film projection team showed 139 films in the district from January to June, with more than 70,000 viewers. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has now established eight film projection teams, and two more will be added in the second half of this year. These film projection teams often climb mountains and ridges to go deep into the mountainous areas for mobile screenings. Two-thirds of the staff of the film projection team are ethnic minority cadres, and they explain in ethnic minority languages during screenings. The local people have received a lot of education from the movies. This year, Tongshi District, Maozhuo Township, had a pest infestation in the early crops. Some people initially superstitiously believed that the pests were released by the "gods" and could not be eliminated. After a film projection team showed the film "Eradicate Rice Pests" there, a pest elimination campaign was launched throughout the township the next day. (Zhang Xiaode)
    Li and Miao High School Students
    More than 400 Li and Miao children in the elementary schools of the five counties in the Wuzhi Mountain area of Hainan Island have become graduates of advanced primary schools. Among them, about 110 will enter the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Normal School to study; another group of students will enter the first grade of junior high school developed and prepared by the primary school to receive secondary education. Those who do not continue their studies will participate in local construction.
    Primary education in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has developed greatly in the past few years. The number of Li and Miao children who have the opportunity to study has increased year by year. At present, there are more than 30,000 Li and Miao children studying in schools in the prefecture. After more than 50 Li and Miao young men and women graduate from junior normal schools this autumn, primary education will have further development. (Huang Xiangqing) (Attached Picture)

    来自海南岛的喜讯
    准备远洋捕鱼
    海南岛沿海各渔港一千一百多艘载重六百担以上的大渔船，正在作远航准备，计划在今年秋季鱼汛到来的时候，发展远洋捕鱼作业。这些船大部分都装置了收音机，有的还装置了发动机和灯光捕鱼器。
    这次远洋作业是海南岛解放以来规模最大的一次。西沙群岛渔场是计划作业渔场中的一个，过去渔民只在那里搜集鸟粪、海参、海菜和贝类，这次准备在那里捕捉经济价值较高的红鱼和立鱼等。

    罐头厂开始生产
    新建立的地方国营海口罐头厂已经开始生产，第一批产品是接受订货的海南岛罐头菠萝，正在待运出国。
    地处热带的海南岛出产许多水果，菠萝是其中著名的一种，全岛年产量约有十一、二万担。过去因为菠萝不易贮藏，运销外地的不多；现在有了这个罐头厂，就能使国内外更多的人吃到这种味甜多汁而又芳香的水果了。
      目前正是菠萝收获的季节，在罐头厂的配制车间，里里外外堆满了菠萝。这些菠萝经过切削入罐以后，经过运输带传送到自动抽空封盖机，然后，忙碌的吊车把一箩箩罐头送到消毒缸里去。这样制造出来的罐头菠萝能够保存一年，菠萝的鲜美味道不变。从五月开始生产到现在，每天的产量已经达到二万五千罐了。
    在菠萝加工季节过去以后，这个工厂除将制造各种肉类罐头以外，还要利用海南岛的特产椰子，制造罐头“加嘎”。这是用椰子、鸡蛋调制成的一种糖酱。现在已经根据食品出口公司的要求，赶制了一批样品。　　（曾珊）
    大量的鞣料资源
    在海南岛的贵重用材林中，有大量的鞣料作物可以利用。鞣料是制革、染色的重要工业原料，世界上可供提炼的作物很多，但是以热带出产的种类最多、品质最好。目前，海南岛上的鞣料作物，以红树林价值最高，其中有的树种含鞣料约23％以上，试验结果，所制皮革颜色鲜明、质地柔软而富有弹性。这些红树林丛生在海河交界和风浪较静的泥滩上，以北部和东部沿岸最多。
    岛上各地还有树皮含鞣料16％以下的油甘子、大叶合欢、台湾相思等八种林木，大部分是从来没有利用过的。比较普遍的薯莨、洋蹄薯、青皮胶等鞣料作物，各地都有出产，土产公司每年都收购几千担。根据海南岛的自然条件，今后还可以引种其他高级鞣料作物。

    向荒地进军
    今年春天以来，海南岛上原有和新建的三十四个国营垦殖场和机械农场都积极开展了向荒地进军的运动，仅第一季度就已经开荒六万一千六百多亩。
    为了扩大热带和亚热带经济作物的种植面积，支援国家工业建设，今年计划在原有四十万多亩的基础上再开垦二十二万多亩，种植的作物将大大增加，如剑麻就比去年增加面积五倍多，香茅草比以往三年的定植数还要增加四倍。新种下的香茅草的成活率，从去年的50％提高到95％。（曾珊、李起龙）
    从高山迁到平地
    散居在五指山区高山峻岭上的苗族人民大搬家马上开始了。这次一千多户五千多人的大搬家将要在今年十一月以前全部完成，从此，整个海南黎族苗族自治州的二千三百多户苗族同胞，就全部脱离瘴气弥漫、野兽出没的环境，到山下平地来和各族人民一起发展生产，过安居乐业的生活。
    为了帮助苗族同胞搬家，黎族苗族自治州人民委员会决定拨出十万元作为移民费；居住在山下的黎族人民，也选择了自然环境较好、经苗族同胞同意的地方，建造了大批新房屋，开辟了许多新村，等待他们迁搬下来。
    海南黎族苗族自治州的苗族人民，过去受国民党反动派的压迫、残杀，为了生存，只好逃居在深山高岭上，没有耕牛、农具，仅靠用原始方法种一点点“山兰”（坡稻）和打猎过活，生活非常贫困。1952年自治州成立以后，党和人民政府帮助他们分批迁移下山。几年来，迁移下山的已经有5，973人。　（张孝德）
    电影进了深山
    生活在偏僻的五指山区的黎族苗族人民看电影的机会愈来愈多了。今年以来，保亭县通什区的人民平均一个多月就可以看到一次电影。电影放映队一月至六月共在该区放映了一百三十九场，观众七万多人次。海南黎族苗族自治州目前已建立了八个电影队，今年下半年又将增加二个。这些电影队经常爬山越岭深入山区巡回放映。电影队的工作人员有三分之二是民族干部，放映时他们用民族语言讲解。当地人民从电影中受到很多教育。通什区毛卓乡今年早庄稼发生了虫害，有些群众最初迷信害虫是“天神”放下来的，不能扑灭。一次电影队到那里放映了“根治水稻害虫”的影片后，第二天全乡就掀起了除虫运动。　　（张孝德）
    黎族苗族的高小生
    海南岛五指山区五个县的小学校里，有四百多名黎族苗族的少年儿童成为高级小学毕业生了。他们中间，将有约一百一十名进入海南黎族苗族自治州师范学校学习；另有一部分学生，将进入由小学发展筹办的初中一年级，接受中等教育。不继续升学的，将参加当地的建设事业。
    海南黎族苗族自治州的初等教育，几年来有了很大的发展。黎族苗族的少年儿童得到读书机会的逐年增加，目前在全州有三万多名黎族苗族少年儿童在学校学习。今年秋天，五十多名黎族苗族男女青年从初级师范毕业以后，初等教育将有进一步的发展。　（黄向青）（附图片）
