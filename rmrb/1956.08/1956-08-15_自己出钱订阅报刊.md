Newspapers and periodicals are collective propagandists and collective organizers, and are one of the best tools to help cadres and the masses study current affairs and policies, learn culture and theory, and exchange work experience. In the past, due to the fact that staff members of state organs and employees of state-owned enterprises generally enjoyed the supply system and low salaries, various organs, organizations, troops, schools, and enterprises mostly used administrative and operating expenses to subscribe to newspapers and magazines for cadres and employees to read. This approach was necessary in the past and played a good role.

However, in recent years, with the development of the national economy, the treatment of the vast number of state workers and employees has gradually improved. This provides the material conditions for improving newspaper and periodical distribution. Publicly funded subscriptions, on the one hand, mean that there are too few newspapers for too many people, making reading inconvenient. Some people use public funds to subscribe to many newspapers and periodicals, but in reality, they cannot read them all, which prevents newspapers and periodicals from playing their due role and hinders their rational promotion and distribution. On the other hand, publicly funded subscriptions require the state to pay a considerable amount of expenses. If this money is saved and invested in socialist construction, it will also play a role in promoting the development of China's industrialization. Therefore, the practice of using public funds to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals for private reading should be changed; all newspapers and periodicals for private reading should be subscribed to at one's own expense.

Now, the State Council has issued a notice on the implementation of self-funded subscriptions for privately needed newspapers and periodicals in state organs, organizations, troops, enterprises, and schools. Starting from October 1, all privately read newspapers and periodicals that are not work-related in all organs, organizations, troops, schools, and other institutions, as well as state-owned and jointly state-private enterprises, shall be subscribed to at one's own expense or organized into collective self-funded subscriptions. This is a timely and necessary measure to improve newspaper and periodical distribution.

This change involves a relatively wide range. First, people's thinking is accustomed to the past method of relying on public funds for subscriptions, and the significance of this change may not be fully understood, which may affect the circulation of newspapers and periodicals. Second, this change requires changing from collective subscribers to a large number of individual subscribers. Without good preparation, it is easy to increase the difficulty of subscription, collection and delivery. Therefore, in terms of publicity and promotion, subscription and delivery, thorough preparation must be made.

Leading departments at all levels must conduct thorough mobilization and persuasion work. In particular, the propaganda departments of Party committees must actively organize and promote the Communist Youth League and trade union organizations to carry out publicity and explanation work to the workers and masses, urge relevant departments to do a good job in promoting newspapers and periodicals, and organize cadres and workers to subscribe to the newspapers and periodicals they need according to their economic strength. Those who are economically well-off can subscribe individually, and those who are economically weak can organize collective subscriptions. According to the key trial situation of the postal and telecommunications departments, as long as publicity and mobilization work is done well, and the broad masses of cadres and the masses fully understand the role of newspapers and periodicals and realize the significance and conditions for changing the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, after changing privately read newspapers and periodicals to self-funded subscriptions, the circulation of newspapers and periodicals will not decrease but increase. This shows that the demand of the broad masses of the people in our country for newspapers and periodicals is becoming more and more urgent. We must promote the upsurge of cadres and workers in studying policies, current affairs and culture through the publicity and promotion of newspapers and periodicals. However, self-funded subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals should be completely voluntary, and no apportioning or disguised forced subscriptions that violate the principle of voluntariness are allowed.

Postal and telecommunications departments at all levels should actively develop and handle individual subscriptions in a planned way, improve subscription procedures, and provide individual subscribers with various conveniences for subscribing to newspapers and periodicals. In organizing subscription work, we must give full play to the existing forces, and according to specific circumstances and needs, within organs, organizations, troops, enterprises, factories, mines, schools, etc., under the leadership of the Party organization, through trade unions and the Communist Youth League, designate appropriate personnel to establish mass newspaper and periodical promotion stations and newspaper and periodical promoters in each unit, to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals for the unit and individuals without hindering production and work, and adhering to the principle of voluntariness, and to deliver newspapers and periodicals to readers in a timely manner. The postal and telecommunications departments must actively strengthen contact with relevant departments and those responsible for promotion, study and improve the promotion and subscription work and distribution work. In the establishment of promotion stations, we must also adhere to the principle of voluntariness and establish them according to needs and conditions.

The State Council's notice stipulates that newspapers and periodicals read by township people's committees and rural primary school teachers, newspapers and periodicals subscribed by the troops for collective reading by soldiers, etc., can still be subscribed to with public funds according to actual needs, and are not subject to the restrictions of this provision. The leaders of each unit should grasp this principle reasonably to avoid the phenomenon of reducing what should not be reduced, or not implementing it resolutely.

In the future, the vast majority of readers will subscribe to newspapers and periodicals at their own expense. In this way, the broad masses of readers will inevitably cherish and utilize newspapers and periodicals better, and will properly preserve and study the materials in newspapers and periodicals. On the other hand, it will put forward more requirements for the improvement of editing, publishing, promotion and distribution of newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, newspaper and periodical editorial departments, newspaper and periodical publishing houses and postal and telecommunications departments need to do a better job in all aspects to make newspapers and periodicals better, publishing work better, and promotion and distribution work better, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of readers.

### 自己出钱订阅报刊

    自己出钱订阅报刊
    报纸刊物是集体的宣传者和集体的组织者，是帮助干部和群众学习时事政策，学习文化、理论和交流工作经验的最好工具之一。过去由于国家机关工作人员和国营企业的职工，普遍享受供给制和低薪制待遇，各机关、团体、部队、学校、企业为了提高干部和职工的政治觉悟和文化水平，大都用行政费和事业费订阅报纸和杂志，供给干部和职工阅读。这样做法，在过去的情况下是必要的，而且曾经起了良好的作用。
    但是，几年来，随着国家经济的发展，广大的国家工作人员和职工的待遇已经逐渐改善。这就提供了改进报刊发行工作的物质条件。公款订阅报刊，一方面人多报少，阅读不便，还有少数人用公款订了很多报刊，但实际上并不能都看，使报刊不能发挥它应有的作用，妨碍报刊合理的推广和发行。另一方面，用公款订阅报刊，国家要付出一笔不小的开支，如果把这笔钱节省下来，投入社会主义建设，对于促进我国工业化的发展也将起一定的作用。因此，供给私人阅读的报刊由公费订阅的办法应该改变；凡是私人阅读的报刊应该自己出钱去订。
    现在国务院发出了关于国家机关、团体、部队、企业、学校中私人需要的报刊实行自费订阅的通知。从十月一日起，所有机关、团体、部队、学校以及其它事业单位和国营、公私合营企业单位中非工作需要的私人阅读的报刊，一律由本人自费订阅或者组织起来集体自费订阅。这是改进报刊发行工作的一个及时的和必要的措施。
    这一改变涉及范围比较广，首先是人们思想上习惯于过去依靠公款订阅的办法，对于这一改变的意义可能了解不充分，可能影响到报刊的发行量。其次，这一改变要由集体订户改变为大量的个人订户，如果没有很好的准备，容易增加收订和投递的困难。因此，无论在宣传推广和收订投递等方面，都必须认真地充分地做好准备工作。
    各级领导部门要进行充分的动员说服工作，特别是党委宣传部门必须积极组织和推动青年团、工会组织向职工群众进行宣传解释工作，督促有关部门做好报刊的推广工作，组织干部和职工按照自己的经济力量订阅他们所需要的报刊，经济充足的可以个人订阅，经济力量不足的可以组织集体订阅。根据邮电部门重点试验的情况来看，只要做好宣传动员工作，使广大干部群众充分了解报刊的作用，认识到改变报刊发行工作的意义和条件，在将私人阅读的报刊改为自费订阅以后，报刊发行数量不但不下降，反而有了增加。这就说明了我国广大群众对于报刊的要求是越来越迫切的。我们要通过对于报刊的宣传推广工作，来推动广大干部和职工学习政策、学习时事和学习文化的热潮。但是，自费订阅报刊应该是完全自愿的，不允许有任何违反自愿原则的摊派或变相强迫订阅的现象。
    各级邮电部门应该有计划地积极发展和办理个人订阅，并改进订阅手续，给个人订户以各种订阅报刊的便利。在组织收订工作中，要充分发挥现有的力量，并且可以根据具体情况和需要，在机关、团体、部队、企业、厂矿、学校等单位内，在党组织的领导下，通过工会、青年团，指定适当人员，建立各单位的群众性的报刊推广站和报刊推广员，在不妨碍生产和工作，以及坚持自愿的原则下，收订本单位和个人订阅的报刊，并且使报刊及时发行到读者手中。邮电部门必须积极加强同有关部门和负责推广人员的联系，研究和健全推广收订工作和分发工作。在建立推广站工作中，也要坚持自愿原则，根据需要和条件去建立。
    国务院的通知中规定，乡人民委员会和乡村小学教师阅读的报刊，部队订给战士集体阅读的报刊，等等，仍然可以按照实际需要用公款订阅，不受这项规定的限制。各单位领导方面要根据这个原则，合理掌握，以免发生不应减的减掉，或者执行得不坚决的现象。
    今后最大多数读者都将由自己出钱订阅报刊了。这样，广大读者一方面必然会更好地爱护和利用报刊，对于报刊上的材料也一定会加以妥善的保存和研究。另一方面将对报刊的编辑、出版和推广发行等工作的改进提出更多的要求。因此，报刊编辑部、报刊出版社和邮电部门就更有必要做好各方面的工作，使报刊办得更好，出版工作做得更好，推广发行工作做得更好，以满足广大读者的需要。
