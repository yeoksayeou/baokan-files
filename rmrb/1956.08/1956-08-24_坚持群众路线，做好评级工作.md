Adhere to the Mass Line and Do a Good Job in Grading Work
　　Yao Fu

    Currently, many enterprises and institutions have begun to assess the technical grades of their employees. Grading work is a matter that concerns the immediate interests of every worker and is one of the decisive links in implementing the socialist distribution principle of "to each according to his work." In order to do this work well, it is necessary to resolutely implement the State Council's decision on wage reform and adhere to the mass line. However, not all enterprise leaders are doing this.

    Reader Ai Lin wrote in a letter: "When the Southwest First Engineering Company's Mechanical Supply Station adjusted technical grades, it believed that the upgrade range assessed by the masses was too broad. Without explaining the reasons in detail, it lowered the grades of 43 people."

    Anhui Daily reported: "When the Ma'anshan Mining Area's Sulfide Mine mixed work section was grading, it added other conditions in addition to technical standards. When explaining the promotion of air supply worker Wang Quande's grade, Fan Zonghan, the deputy secretary of the branch, said: 'Wang Quande has made ideological progress and has a good work attitude. Although his technical skills are a bit lacking, he can get a 20% consideration. Having 80% of the skill is enough.' Conversely, when explaining why winding machine operator Chen Defa was not given a raise, Zhao Chengwen, the deputy section chief of the power section, asked everyone to 'unify their thinking based on his character,' and Fan Zonghan, the deputy secretary of the branch, also criticized Chen Defa on the spot for 'raising opinions everywhere' as 'insulting the leadership.'"

    More examples like the above could be cited. Obviously, this practice of arbitrarily suppressing or raising grades without following technical standards and without listening to the opinions of the masses is wrong. But those who insist on this approach believe they have considerable "reasons."

    Those who advocate that grading should take care of "activists" who "study well," "are willing to speak at meetings," and "obey the leadership" are confusing the assessment of technical grades with political consciousness. Technical grade standards are determined based on the conditions that workers of each grade should know and be able to do, and work examples. Therefore, by assessing technical grades, it not only specifically embodies the socialist distribution principle of "to each according to his work," but also can play a role in organizing the labor force. In fact, assessing technical grades and taking care of activists are not contradictory in many cases. Because, for people of the same grade, the quality of their work attitude can be resolved in piece-rate wages and bonus wages. But in some cases, a person's ideological level and technical level are not completely consistent. Some people's political consciousness is indeed very high, but their technical level is not high. Some people's technical level is relatively high, but their thinking is not necessarily very advanced. This is an objective fact. What should be done when assessing grades? The answer is to strictly assess according to technical grade standards. If, when assessing technical grades, everyone adds some additional conditions according to their own likes and dislikes, it will have an adverse impact on workers' learning culture, improving technology, rationally using labor, strengthening unity, and doing a good job in production. Therefore, technical grade standards are the only standard for assessing workers' technical grades, and no other conditions can be attached.

    "What to do if the upgrade range is too wide?" It is said that some people are worried that workers will raise each other's grades, that it will exceed the wage fund and increase costs, and that production backbones will be transferred away. It should be admitted that the phenomenon of workers raising each other's grades does exist in individual enterprises, and may still occur in the future. In order to prevent this deviation, there is only one good way, which is to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and assess grades according to technical standards. According to some people's ideas, it seems that the masses of employees are all "money-loving" and "people go to higher places." In fact, this is not the case. They have not seen the essential side of the masses of employees, which is: selfless and upholding the truth. Yang Zhishan, a steelmaking worker at Ma'anshan, automatically requested not to be upgraded because his skills had not improved. Those who do not trust the masses should learn a lesson from this. A too high upgrade range means increased costs. There is a contradiction here between the upgrade range and the wage target. That is to say, the number of upgrades in this grading should be considered within the scope of the already determined wage growth target, generally not exceeding it, and even less should the technical standards be lowered to blindly expand the upgrade range. In fact, the growth target used for upgrades in this year's total wages is already considerable. As long as it is managed well, it is generally sufficient. The correct approach should be to strictly assess the technical grades of workers according to technical grade standards. Whatever grade it should be, it should be determined to be that grade, and wages should be paid according to the new grade standards. What if the cost really increases? This should be resolved in two ways: one is to strive to improve labor productivity, and the other is to draw out the surplus technical force and transfer it to places where it is urgently needed, so as to truly achieve "making the best use of people's talents." The problem is that the leaders of some enterprises often "want to preserve their strength" and are unwilling to transfer their backbone forces to support new enterprises.

    "Anyway, it's adding money, and everyone is happy when the money is added." This is an excuse for bureaucrats. Bureaucrats often see the winding as straight and the complex as simple. In fact, wage reform work, especially grading work, is a complex work that requires investigation and research, publicity and education, and opposition to various undesirable tendencies such as egalitarianism, sentimentalism, and localism. Therefore, wage reform work cannot be regarded as just the work of the personnel section and the wage section, nor can an irresponsible attitude be adopted, as some factory directors replied to the masses: "What I say doesn't count, what you say doesn't count, what the office says counts," causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The correct approach should be to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to assess grades. In the discussion, whatever should be said should be said, oppose not speaking in person and talking nonsense behind one's back, and oppose acting emotionally and deviating from technical standards. Only in this way can grading work create favorable conditions for improving technology, strengthening unity, and doing a good job in production.

    坚持群众路线，做好评级工作
    药夫
    目前，许多企业单位已经开始评定职工的技术等级了。评级工作是关系到每一个工人的切身利益的问题，是贯彻执行按劳付酬这一社会主义分配原则的决定性环节之一。为了作好这一工作，必须坚决执行国务院关于改革工资的决定，必须坚持群众路线。可是，并不是所有企业的领导者都是这样做的。
    读者艾林来信说：“西南第一工程公司机械供应站调整技术等级的时候，认为群众评的升级面过宽，没有详细说明理由，便降低了四十三人的等级”。
    安徽日报载：马鞍山矿区硫铁矿混合工段在评级的时候，除技术标准外，还加上了其他条件。支部副书记范宗汉在解释提升送风工王全德的级别的时候说：“王全德思想进步，工作态度好，技术虽差一点，可以有20％的照顾，有80％的本领就行了。”相反，在解释不给卷扬工陈德发升级的时候，动力科副科长赵成文要求大家“根据他的品质”“统一思想”，支部副书记范宗汉还当场批评陈德发“到处提意见”是“对领导上的污辱”。
    像上述的例子还可举出一些。显然，这种离开技术标准任意压低或提升等级，不倾听群众意见的作法是错误的。但是坚持这种作法的人，还认为他们有相当的“理由”。
    主张评级要照顾那些“学习好”，“开会肯发言”，“服从领导”的“积极分子”的人，是把评定技术等级和政治觉悟混为一谈。技术等级标准，是根据每一级工人应知应会的条件，和工作实例来确定的，因此，通过评定技术等级，不仅具体体现着“按劳付酬”这一社会主义分配原则；而且还可以起到组织劳动力的作用。事实上评定技术等级和照顾积极分子在许多情况下是不矛盾的。因为，同等级的人，劳动态度的好坏，可以在计件工资和奖励工资中得到解决。但是在某种情况下，一个人的思想水平和技术水平并不完全一致，有的人政治觉悟确实很高，但是技术水平不高，有的人技术水平比较高，但是思想不一定很进步，这是一个客观事实。在评定等级的时候应该怎样办呢？答复是应该严格按着技术等级标准来评定。如果评定技术等级的时候各人按着自己的爱恶增加一些附加条件，那就会对工人学习文化提高技术、合理使用劳动力、加强团结、搞好生产带来不利的影响。因此，技术等级标准是评定工人技术等级的唯一标准，不能附加其他条件。
    “升级面过宽怎么办”？据说，有些人的顾虑是：怕工人互相抬级，怕超过工资基金加大成本，怕把生产骨干调走。应该承认：工人互相抬高等级的现象在个别企业里是有的，今后也还可能发生。为了防止发生这种偏向，只有一个好办法，就是动员群众、依靠群众，根据技术标准来评定等级。按着有些人的想法，好像职工群众都是“爱钱如命”“人向高处走”。其实不然，他们没有看到职工群众的本质的一面，就是：大公无私，坚持真理。马鞍山炼铁工人杨知山因为技术没有提高，他就自动要求不升级。不相信群众的人应该从这里吸取教训。升级面过高就意味着成本加大，这里有升级面和工资指标的矛盾。就是说，这次评级升级人数应该在已经确定的工资增长指标的范围内来考虑，一般不得超过，更不允许降低技术标准盲目扩大升级面。事实上今年工资总额中升级用的增长指标已经不少，只要掌握得好，一般是够用的。正确的作法应该是严格按着技术等级标准评定工人的技术等级，该是那一级就应该定那一级，同时按照新的等级标准发给工资。真的成本加大了怎么办？这应该从两方面来解决，一是努力提高劳动生产率，一是把多余的技术力量抽调出来，调到急需的地方去，真正做到“人尽其才”。问题倒是有的企业领导者往往“为了保存实力”，不愿把骨干力量调去支援新企业。
    “反正是加钱，加了钱大家都欢喜”。这是官僚主义者的借口。官僚主义者往往把曲折的看成直线的，把复杂的当成简单的。实际上工资改革工作，特别是评级工作，是一个复杂的工作，要调查研究，要宣传教育，要反对各种不良倾向，如平均主义、感情用事、本位主义等。因此，不能把工资改革工作，看作只是人事科和工资科的工作，也不能采取不负责任的态度，像有的厂长答复群众说的那样：“我说了也不算，你们说了也不算，处里说了才算”，引起群众不满。正确的做法应该是从上而下和从下而上结合起来评定等级，在讨论中，应该有什么说什么，反对当面不说，背后乱说，反对脱离技术标准感情用事。只有这样，才能使评级工作为提高技术、加强团结、搞好生产创造有利条件。
