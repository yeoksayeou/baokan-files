    Do Not Relax Orchard Management
    Zhang Zhaoxin
    In the upsurge of agricultural collectivization, orchard management in many fruit-producing areas has shown new features that were not seen in previous years. Work such as cleaning orchards, earthing up for winter protection, pruning and fertilizing, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests has been strengthened compared to the past. However, many agricultural cooperatives do not have a correct understanding of fruit production. They believe that fruit production is not as important as cotton and grain, and simply emphasize increasing grain production. A lot of fertilizer is applied to grain fields, but very little or no fertilizer is applied to orchards. Some even divert fertilizer intended for orchards to the fields. Because they are busy with field production, they cannot take care of orchard management. Some orchards, due to lack of fertilizer and poor management, have begun to be neglected, seriously affecting this year's fruit production increase. This year's Huangyan tangerines in Zhejiang were originally supposed to have a bumper year, but according to farmers, they will only yield 70% of their potential; according to a survey by the Sichuan Jiangjin Special District Cooperative Office, Jiangjin's sweet oranges this year will be 20%-30% lower than in 1954.
    This year's loquats, apricots, peaches, and other summer fruits have been harvested and put on the market successively, but the majority of the main fruits will not ripen until late autumn and early winter. The next three to four months are the rapid growth season for fruits such as tangerines and apples. Strengthening orchard management during this period is the key to increasing fruit production this year. Opening up fertilizer sources, increasing topdressing, and timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests are the main contents of orchard management. In fruit-producing areas along the coast where there are strong winds in autumn, propping up branches to prevent wind damage is also very important.
    Harvesting fruit is a very delicate task. If this task is not done well, a year of hard work will be wasted. Although it is not the season for large-scale fruit harvesting at present, much preparatory work must be carried out as early as possible.
    Grain and cotton production are very important, but fruit production can also increase the income of cooperative members. According to surveys in the key tangerine-producing areas of Xingan and Qingjiang counties in Jiangxi, some well-managed cooperatives can increase tangerine production by about 20% this year. Tangerines alone can increase the income of the cooperative by 5%-10%. If agricultural cooperatives only pay attention to grain and cotton production and not to diversified production to enrich production content, it will inevitably affect the income of cooperative members.

    不要放松对果园的管理
    张肇鑫
    在农业合作化的高潮里，许多水果产区的果园管理出现了往年没有的新气象，清洁果园、培土防寒、修剪施肥、防治病虫害等工作，都比过去加强了。但是有不少农业合作社对水果生产认识不正确。他们认为水果生产不如棉粮重要，单纯强调增产粮食，粮田的肥料施得很多，果园的肥料却施得很少或根本不施。有的甚至把果园用的肥料挪用到大田里。它们由于忙于大田生产，就顾不上果园的管理了。有些果园因为缺乏肥料和疏于管理，已开始有荒芜状态，严重地影响到今年水果增产。浙江黄岩柑桔今年原是大年，但据农民反映只能有七成的收成；据四川江津专区合作办事处调查，今年江津的甜橙将比1954年减产20％—30％。
    今年的枇杷、杏、桃等夏季水果已陆续采收上市，但大量的主要的水果，要在秋末冬初才能成熟。目前柑桔、苹果等水果正在迅速生长季节，加强今后三至四个月内的果园管理，是今年水果增产的关键。开辟肥源，增施追肥，及时防治病虫害，都是果园管理的主要内容。沿海秋季多风的水果产区，吊枝防风也是很重要的事情。
    采收水果是一件非常细致的工作，这件工作如果作不好，一年的辛勤劳动就算白费了。目前虽然不是大量采收水果的季节，但是许多准备工作都要及早进行。
    粮食、棉花生产很重要，水果生产也同样可以增加社员收入。据江西新淦、清江两县重点柑桔产区的调查，一些经营管理好的合作社，今年柑桔可增产20％左右，仅柑桔一项，就能增加社的收入5％—10％。农业合作社如果只注意粮、棉生产，不注意多种生产，丰富生产内容，那就必然会影响社员的收入。
