    Water Splashing (and Another Poem)
    Zhou Liangpei
    During the Dai New Year (seven days after Qingming Festival) in Yunnan, young Dai men and women playfully splash water on each other as a sign of friendship. In the water splashing, they dodge each other; whoever gets splashed considers it a sign of respect and blessing.
    A group of girls carrying buckets of water,
    Surround the gate of the border defense camp,
    The girls are frustrated, they can't find the soldiers,
    The soldiers have already slipped into the bamboo forest.
    They chase into the bamboo forest,
    Hearing the soldiers' footsteps,
    The girls giggle with delight,
    The soldiers hear them and quickly run!
    The girls can't catch the soldiers,
    So they splash the water on the ground:
    "Why are you afraid, running away,
    Don't you want the blessings we offer!"
    The soldiers stand there, dumbfounded,
    Not knowing what to do,
    The girls seize the opportunity to rush forward,
    Pouring all the water from their buckets onto the soldiers...
    Dai New Year 1317 in Daluo.
    Suona Horn
    On the silent banks of the Nujiang River,
    The suona horn sounds continuously;
    The soldier plays it alone, smiling,
    As if talking to it.
    The soldier is lonely after his shift guarding the bridge,
    He is all alone;
    But the soldier, at any time,
    Knows how to live his life...

    泼水（外一首）
    周良沛
    云南傣族人民在傣历新年（清明后七天）那天，青年男女互相友好地泼水。泼水中，互相躲闪；凡被泼者，则认为受到人们的尊敬与祝福。
    一群提着水桶的姑娘，
    围在边防军营的门边，
    姑娘很丧气，没找到士兵，
    士兵早已闪进了竹林。
    她们追到竹林，
    听见士兵的脚步声音，
    姑娘高兴得“噗嗤”一笑，
    士兵听见就赶快跑！
    姑娘追不到士兵，
    把水泼在地上：
    “你为什么害怕，逃跑，
    送给你的祝福不要！”
    士兵楞在那里，
    不知道怎样才好，
    姑娘乘机赶上前去，
    桶里的水全往士兵身上倒……
    傣历一三一七新年于打洛。
    唢呐
    在寂静的怒江之畔，
    不停地响着呐唢；
    士兵独自吹着，笑着，
    好像和它在说话。
    士兵守桥下了班好寂寞，
    四下里只有他独自一个；
    可是士兵在任何时候，
    都知道怎样生活………
