    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party stated in a telegram to the Central Committee of the German Communist Party that the entire Vietnamese working class and working people were extremely indignant upon learning that the West German reactionary authorities had resorted to despicable means to declare the German Communist Party illegal and dissolve it.
    The telegram said, "We firmly believe that the Adenauer group's conspiracy will ultimately only lead them to a tragic failure. The courageous, resolute, and powerful German Communist Party cannot and will never be eliminated. It will continue to lead the German working class and the German people in the struggle for the establishment of a peaceful, unified, and democratic Germany, and for the realization of socialism."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Tokyo dispatch: The "Akahata" newspaper reported on the 20th that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party sent a letter of protest to the West German government and the West German Constitutional Court on the 18th, protesting their decision to declare the German Communist Party illegal.

    The Korean Federation of Trade Unions firmly demanded the immediate revocation of this illegal verdict against the German Communist Party and the swift adoption of measures to guarantee the legality of the German Communist Party.
    On the same day, the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to German trade union organizations, expressing respect to the German trade union organizations that resolutely opposed the court's unreasonable decision.
