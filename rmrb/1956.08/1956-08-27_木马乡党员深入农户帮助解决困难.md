Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 24th: The Communist Party branch in Muma Township, Guiding County, Guizhou Province, organized Party members and cadres from the township and agricultural production cooperatives to visit peasant households, helping cooperative members solve various difficulties in their lives and further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses.

Since the implementation of complete socialist agricultural cooperation in the township this spring, due to the relatively good development of production, complacency has grown among the Party members and cadres of the township and cooperatives. They have not been concerned enough about the lives of cooperative members. Some cooperative members of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative had difficulties in their lives and did not have money to buy salt and oil. They asked to pre-draw some pocket money, but the cooperative cadres thought they were deliberately complaining and refused to lend it to them. Some cooperative members planned to burn some charcoal to increase their pocket money, but the cooperative management committee stipulated that charcoal burning should be managed uniformly by the cooperative and not be allowed for free trade. Jin Xing Agricultural Production Cooperative member Yin Quanzhong's wife was about to give birth and had difficulty working. The cooperative did not take care of him and even criticized him for being lazy. This approach by some cooperative cadres affected the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

At the end of July, after the township Party branch criticized the ideological style of not caring about the hardships of the cooperative members, it immediately organized Party members and cadres from the township and cooperatives to take advantage of production gaps to conduct household visits to all 325 cooperative member households in the two cooperatives in the township. They learned about their difficulties and listened to their opinions. During the visits, it was discovered that some cooperative members lacked food and clothing, and some lacked pocket money or housing. In the past, Party members and cooperative cadres either did not understand these difficulties of the cooperative members, or they did not pay attention to them. Now, the cooperative members have raised these opinions and have also made many reasonable requests to the cooperative. Such in-depth visits have greatly educated Party members and cadres. Wen Guoqiong, secretary of the township Party branch, and Tang Chaozhang, the township head, have all reviewed their bureaucratic style of not caring about the hardships of the cooperative members and not helping them solve their difficulties.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, the two agricultural production cooperatives conducted serious research on the difficulties raised by the cooperative members and put forward solutions: for the 53 cooperative members who lacked food, the cooperative pre-drew 2,480 catties of wheat and 150 yuan in cash to help them solve their difficulties; for the 122 cooperative members who lacked money for salt and oil, 800 yuan was pre-drawn from the cooperative's sideline income based on workdays. The cooperative also helped solve the housing problems of the 19 cooperative members in different ways. For example, Wei Zhengru, a poor peasant, and his family of nine only lived in one room, so the cooperative pre-drew 100 catties of wheat for him, and the township loaned him 100 catties of accumulated grain and mobilized cooperative members to help him build three houses. Three cooperative members lacked foundations for their houses, and the cooperative tried to coordinate and solve the problem. As for those whose housing was difficult but could barely manage, it was decided to rebuild them after autumn. For the 36 women who could not often work due to a lot of housework, it was decided to leave them enough time to take care of housework. Pregnant women would no longer be forced to work, and those who asked to work would be arranged to do light work.

The Party branch and the agricultural production cooperatives' concern for the cooperative members has strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses and mobilized the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production. Jin Xing Agricultural Production Cooperative member Tian Shaoyun did not work before because he lacked food. Now that he has pre-drawn 50 catties of wheat, he went to work that day. He saw that wild animals were seriously harming corn, and even when it was not his turn, he would scramble to defend it at night.

### 木马乡党员深入农户帮助解决困难

    木马乡党员深入农户帮助解决困难
    据新华社贵阳24日电　贵州省贵定县中共木马乡支部，组织乡和农业生产合作社的党员、干部深入社员家庭进行访问，帮助社员解决了生活上的各种困难，进一步密切了党和群众的关系。
    这个乡自从今春实行全社会主义农业合作化以后，因为生产开展得比较好，乡、社的党员和干部中就滋长了自满情绪，对社员生活关心不够。红光农业生产合作社有的社员生活困难，没钱买盐油，要求预支些零用钱，社干部认为他们故意叫苦，不给借支；有的社员打算烧点木炭来增加零用钱，社的管理委员会又规定烧炭要由社统一经营，不准自由买卖。金星农业生产合作社社员尹全忠的妻子快要生孩子了，出工有困难，社里不照顾他，还批评他懒惰。某些社干部的这种作风，影响了社员的生产积极性。
    7月底，乡党支部批判了不关心社员群众疾苦的思想作风后，马上组织乡、社的党员和干部，利用生产空隙，对全乡两个社的三百二十五户社员 ，逐户进行了家庭访问，了解他们的困难，倾听他们的意见。在访问中发现有些社员缺口粮和衣服，有的缺零用钱或住房。过去，党员和社干部对社员的这些困难不是不了解，就是不重视。现在，社员们把这些意见提了出来，还向社里提了很多合理的要求。经过这样的深入访问，使党员和干部受到很大教育。乡支部书记文国琼、乡长唐朝章等都检讨了自己不关心社员疾苦、不帮助社员解决困难的官僚主义作风。
    在党支部的领导下，这两个农业生产合作社对社员们提出的困难，进行了认真的研究，并且提出了解决的办法：对五十三户缺少口粮的社员，由社预支麦子二千四百八十斤、人民币一百五十元，帮助他们解决困难，一百二十二户缺盐油钱的社员，从社的副业收入中，按劳动日预支八百元。对十九户缺房子住的社员，也分别情况帮助解决，如贫农韦正如一家九口只住一间房子，社里就预支给他一百斤麦子，乡里贷给他一百斤积谷，发动社员帮他修了三间房子；有三户社员缺少屋基，由社里设法调剂解决；其余住屋虽有困难，但能勉强安身的，决定秋后再修。对三十六户因家务多不能常出工的妇女，决定留给她们足够的时间料理家务；对怀孕的妇女，不再勉强叫她们出工，要求出工的就安排她们干些轻活。
    党支部和农业生产合作社对社员的这种关怀，密切了党和群众的联系，发动了社员的生产积极性。金星农业生产合作社社员田少云原来因缺口粮没有出工，现在他预支到五十斤小麦后，当天就出工了。他看到野兽危害玉米严重，有时没有轮到他的班，晚间也争着去防守。
