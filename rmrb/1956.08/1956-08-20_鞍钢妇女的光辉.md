In Anshan, a place known as the "City of Steel," there are now more than fourteen thousand six hundred women working as laborers, engineers, designers, foremen, and site directors... They work as diligently as their male counterparts. What is recorded here are just some scattered stories, but even these are enough to fully demonstrate the wisdom and strength of women in production.

	The distance they've safely traveled is equivalent to circling the globe four times

Mu Shufang drove her "March 8th Youth" electric locomotive diligently all night, her healthy complexion still rosy with no sign of fatigue. Before going off shift in the morning, she carefully inspected the locomotive's parts, handing over the flawless machine to He Suzhen, who came to take over.

Mu Shufang is the driver-leader of the "March 8th Youth" electric locomotive. The crew she leads safely traveled more than 163,000 kilometers from January of last year to August 15th of this year. This distance is equivalent to circling the Earth's equator four times.

The young women driving the "March 8th Youth" electric locomotive have encountered many stormy nights with slippery roads and high resistance. The heavy rain blurred the glass windows in front of the operating table, forcing them to stick their heads out to see. Rainwater dripped from their faces and hair onto their bodies. But they maintained the same calm as on normal days, confidently maneuvering the controls to move forward victoriously. Many freezing winter nights and scorching summers have passed, and they have always worked from day into night, and from night into dawn. They transport coal from Anshan's gate – Lishan – to Anshan Iron and Steel's Chemical Plant. People always watch with admiration as this locomotive, pulling more than twenty carriages, speeds past.

	A crane operator with a thousand accident-free days

Yang Hua is one of the eighty-six crane operators, and an outstanding female crane operator, at the Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill. She operates the giant crane continuously overhead. When the slow cooling pit is filled with more than a hundred red-hot steel rails, she skillfully maneuvers the crane hook, hooking the lid of the slow cooling pit, which is dozens of meters long and wide, and covering it tightly in just one or two minutes.

Workers all like Yang Hua's crane, because she is always very responsible, waiting by the slow cooling pit. When lifting the cover, she is steady and accurate, never delaying. Yang Hua understands her responsibility; if the slow cooling pit cover is placed even one or two minutes late, the quality of these hundred-plus steel rails will be reduced. Therefore, her movements are always quick and careful. Now she has become a crane operator with a thousand accident-free days.

	The leader of the all-purpose welding team

When countless electric sparks illuminate the workshop of the Metal Structure Plant, we can see a female welder working there. She lifts the knight-like mask from her face, revealing long hair. She wipes the sweat that streams down from her forehead, quickly returns to the giant steel frame, and lifts the heavy welding machine. She is the female welder Li Guilan.

Li Guilan has never been absent from work in one thousand two hundred workdays. Once, during a flash flood, the river water rose above her chest. She braved the storm, forcefully crossed the flooded river, and still arrived on time from her home, dozens of miles away from the factory, to start her shift. This diligent, twenty-one-year-old girl has recently been promoted to the leader of the all-purpose welding team.

	New Contributions from Female Designers

In the Refractory Materials Department of the Anshan Branch of the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, eight young female designers have designed more than one thousand three hundred blueprints for the refractory materials plant of the new steel base of the motherland in the first seven months of this year.

People all praise a female designer among these design workers named Fu Chao-gui. She is always thinking deeply about ways to save materials. Not long ago, when she was designing a tunnel drying kiln, the blueprint specifications required using steel rails weighing eleven kilograms per meter. After research, she determined that lighter rails weighing eight kilograms could be used instead. Also, the steel plate covering the hot blast eye was originally required to be ten millimeters thick, but she suggested that a three-millimeter-thick steel plate would be sufficient. Her suggestions, after review by experts, were considered reasonable and would not adversely affect the quality of the project.

Many novice designers particularly like Fu Chao-gui. When they encounter unsolvable difficulties, they always consult Fu Chao-gui, because they can always get satisfactory answers from her.

Currently, Fu Chao-gui and her colleagues, under the guidance of Soviet experts, are designing a new type of preheating device in front of the rotary kiln, which is a new technology that has never been used in China's refractory industry history.

    鞍钢妇女的光辉
    新华社记者　徐放
    在鞍山，这个被人们称为“钢铁之城”的地方，现在共有一万四千六百多个妇女做了工人、工程师、设计师、工长和工地主任……。她们和男工一样辛勤地劳动着。这里记下的仅是一些零星的事迹。但就是这些也充分显示出了妇女们在生产上的智慧和力量。
    她们安全行驶的里程相当于围绕地球四周
    穆淑芳驾驶着她的“三八青年号”电机车紧张地工作了一夜，她那健康的脸色还是红喷喷的没有半点倦容。在早晨下班以前，她仔细地检查了车子的机件，把没有半点毛病的机车交给了前来接班的何素珍。
    穆淑芳是“三八青年号”电机车的司机长。她领导的这个包乘小组在去年一月到今年的八月十五日，已经安全行驶了十六万三千多公里。这个里程相当于围绕地球赤道转四周。
    驾驶“三八青年号”电机车的姑娘们，曾经遇到过好多次暴风雨的夜晚，道路滑，阻力大，暴雨把操作台前的玻璃窗打得一片模糊，她们只好把头伸出窗外去了望。雨水从脸上、头发上直滴在身上。可是她们像平常的日子一样，安静地掌握操纵盘胜利前进。多少个严寒的冬夜和炎热的夏天过去了，她们总是白昼连着黑夜，从黑夜又到黎明。他们从鞍山的大门——立山，把一车车的煤运到鞍钢的化工总厂。人们总爱用敬佩的眼光，注视这辆拖着二十多个车厢的机车奔驶过去。
    千日无事故的吊车手
    杨华是鞍钢大型轧钢厂八十六个吊车工里的一个优秀女吊车手。她驾驶着那台巨型吊车不停地临空而过。当缓冷坑里放满了一百多根火红的钢轨的时候，她就灵巧地摆动着吊车挂勾，勾住那长宽好几十公尺的缓冷坑盖子，只在一、二分钟里就把缓冷坑盖得严密无缝了。
    工人都喜欢杨华的吊车，因为她总是十分负责地守候在缓冷坑边上，吊盖子的时候，又稳又准，从不迟缓。杨华心里明白自己的责任，要是缓冷坑的盖子盖得稍慢一、二分钟，这一百多根钢轨就会降低质量。所以她的动作总是又敏捷又仔细。现在她已经成了一个千日无事故的吊车手。
    万能电焊组组长
    当无数的电光闪亮在金属结构厂的工场上的时候，我们可以看到在这里工作的一个电焊女工。她揭开脸上古骑士式的面罩，露出了长长的头发，她抹去了从额角上直淌下来的汗珠，迅速地又匐匍在巨型的钢架上，举起沉重的电焊机。她就是女电焊工李桂兰。
    李桂兰在一千二百多个工作日里，从来没有缺过勤，有一次洪水暴涨，河水满过她的胸前。她冒着暴风雨，用力划过了涨满水的小河，还是准时地从离工厂几十里路的家里赶来上了班。这位二十一岁的勤劳的姑娘，最近已经提拔为万能电焊小组的组长了。
    女设计师的新贡献
    在黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院的耐火科里，八个年轻的女设计师在今年七个多月里，已为祖国新的钢铁基地的耐火材料厂，设计出了一千三百多张图纸。
    人们都赞扬这些女设计工作者里面的一个名叫傅朝珪的女设计师。她总是沉思默虑的想办法节省材料。不久之前，在她设计隧道干燥窑的时候，图纸资料上规定要用每公尺十一公斤重的钢轨，她研究之后，确定可以改用八公斤轻轨。还有盖在热风眼上面的钢板原来要十粍厚，她建议改为三粍厚的钢板就足够了。她的这些建议经过专家的审核，认为都很合理，对工程质量没有坏影响。
    不少设计工作中的新手，特别喜爱傅朝珪。他们遇到不可解决的困难时，总是请教傅朝珪。因为从她那里，总是可以圆满地得到答案。
    现在，傅朝珪和她的同伴们，正在苏联专家指导下，设计一种新型的回转炉前的预热装置，这是我国过去耐火工业历史上从未有过的新技术。
