    Train Drivers No Longer Threatened by High Temperatures in Tunnels
    Yushengxiang Electric Factory Manufactures Refrigerators

    (Reported by this newspaper) Wu Jincui, Deputy Director, and Wu Jinqi, Head of the Technology Section of the Beijing Joint State-Private Yushengxiang Electric Factory, have successfully trial-produced China's first intermittent absorption refrigerator. This refrigerator solves the problem of high temperatures in train driver's cabs when entering tunnels, a problem that has never been solved in China's history. This is a major contribution to ensuring the safety of train crew members and train operations.

    On the 15th and 16th, the Ministry of Railways used locomotive ㄇ丂一 type 2165, equipped with this refrigerator, and another locomotive in multiple unit operation to pull a train weighing about 2,000 tons on the Fengsha Line for two tests (in the past, the Fengsha Line could only be operated in reverse with a single locomotive), and the results were very good. When the train entered the tunnel, the locomotive crew opened the air vents, and a stream of cool air was released from the three air vents directly above the crew's heads; at this time, the temperature felt by the crew was only 28 or 29 degrees Celsius, and did not exceed 31 degrees Celsius at the highest; the air in the cab was not turbid either. Before the installation of this refrigerator, the temperature in the driver's cab would rise sharply to 45 to 55 degrees Celsius, and reach 60 degrees Celsius at the highest, and the cab was filled with smoke. Crew members were often fainted by this high temperature and smoke. From the opening of the Fengsha Line last October to April this year, 13 personal injury accidents occurred as a result. The installation of this refrigerator on the locomotive can not only ensure the safety of crew members and train operations, but also solve the problem of multiple unit operation on the Fengsha Line, which will increase the transportation efficiency of the Fengsha Line by twice as much as it is now.

    This intermittent absorption refrigerator was designed by Wu Jincui (capitalist), Deputy Director, and Wu Jinqi (capitalist), Head of the Technology Section of the Beijing Joint State-Private Yushengxiang Electric Factory, based on the structural principles of discarded imported small refrigerators (using kerosene) and with reference to certain foreign books. It has low cost, simple manufacturing, is sturdy and durable, and is relatively simple and easy to operate and maintain. Currently, they are designing and trial-producing continuous absorption refrigerators. (Chao)

    (Reported by this newspaper) The intermittent absorption refrigerator trial-produced by the Beijing Joint State-Private Yushengxiang Electric Factory has now officially begun production. The first batch of 50 refrigerators produced for the Ministry of Railways has already had six units begin installation.

    After these 50 refrigerators are produced, the Ministry of Railways plans to allocate them to locomotives on the Fengsha Railway and the Baocheng Railway. (Chao)

### 火车进入隧道司机室将不再受高温威胁  裕生祥电机厂制成冷冻机

    火车进入隧道司机室将不再受高温威胁
    裕生祥电机厂制成冷冻机
    本报讯　北京市公私合营裕生祥电机厂副厂长吴金萃和技术科长吴金起，试制成我国第一台间断式的吸收式冷冻机。这种冷冻机解决了我国历史上从未解决的火车进入隧道后司机室内的高温问题，这是保障火车乘务员生命安全和行车安全的一个重大贡献。
    十五、十六两日，铁道部用装有这台冷冻机的冂丂一型二一六五号机车，和另一台机车重联牵引载重两千吨左右的列车，在丰沙线上作了两次试验（过去丰沙线只能单机逆向行车），效果很好。当火车进入隧道后，机车乘务员把风门打开，正对乘务员头顶的三个风斗，就放出一股股清凉的冷风；这时乘务员所感受到的温度只有摄氏二十八、九度，最高不超过三十一度；室内空气也不混浊。在没有安装这种冷冻机以前，火车一进入隧道，司机室内的温度就急剧增加到摄氏四十五度到五十五度，最高时达到六十度，而且室内烟雾弥漫。乘务员常被这种高温和烟气熏晕过去。丰沙线从去年十月通车到今年四月，就因此连续发生十三次人身事故。机车上安装了这种冷冻机，不仅可以保证乘务员生命安全和行车安全，并且也解决了丰沙线的双机重联牵引的问题，这样丰沙线的运输效率将可以比现在提高一倍。
    这种间断式的吸收式冷冻机，是北京市公私合营裕生祥电机厂副厂长吴金萃（资方）和技术科长吴金起（资方）根据废弃的进口的小冰箱（用煤油的）的构造原理和参考某些外国书籍研究设计出来的，成本低，制造简单，坚固耐用，操纵和检修也较简单容易。目前，他们正在设计试制连续式的吸收式冷冻机。　（超）
    本报讯　北京市公私合营裕生祥电机厂试制成的间断式的吸收式冷冻机，现在已正式开始生产。第一批为铁道部生产的五十台冷冻机，现在已经有六台开始安装。
    这五十台冷冻机生产出来以后，铁道部计划将分配给丰沙铁路和宝成铁路的机车。　（超）
