	Random Thoughts

	It is said that fearing criticism and loving praise is human nature; but those who cannot withstand criticism often cannot withstand praise either, which seems to be a common state of affairs. ＊

	Pretending to understand when you don't is laughable, but not understanding, not pretending to understand, and not wanting to understand or seeking to understand, is frightening, because even the opportunity to be ashamed is gone. ＊

	Stirred living water is better than clear stagnant water: the former not only does not rot, but also has the hope of becoming clear in its flow; while the latter is not only prone to rot, but also easily becomes turbid, and once turbid, can never become clear again. ＊

	Ten unintelligent people are often more intelligent than one intelligent person, while ten intelligent people are often afraid of one unintelligent person.

    据说怕被批评而爱受表扬，是人之常情；但经不起批评的也往往经不起表扬，好像也是人之常态。＊
    不懂装懂是可笑的，而不懂不装懂而又不想懂不求懂，却是可怕的了，因为连害羞的机会都没有。＊
    混的活水比清的死水好：前者不但不腐，而且在流动中有变清的希望；而后者不但易腐，而且易混，而且一混便不能再变清了。＊
    十个不聪明的人往往比一个聪明人更聪明，而十个聪明人往往害怕一个不聪明的人。
