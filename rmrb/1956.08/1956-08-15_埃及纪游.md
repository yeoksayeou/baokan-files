(IV) The Egyptian Museum

On the banks of the Nile is the Egyptian Museum. This museum can be said to be one of the most treasured in the world. The museum was built in 1881, and the museum displays more than six thousand cultural relics left over from ancient Egypt spanning more than thirty centuries. Ancient Egypt, from the Menes Dynasty in 3200 BC to Cleopatra in 30 BC, had a total of thirty-three generations, each of which left many cultural relics. There are pottery and stone tools from the prehistoric period of Egypt, huge stone statues of ancient Egyptian emperors, papyrus for the emperor's correspondence, and many mummies of emperors and birds and animals that have been preserved for thousands of years. The museum also contains wooden boats built in ancient Egypt and many ancient Egyptian works of art. There is also the complete and grand tomb of the ancient emperor Tutankhamun discovered in 1922....

Unfortunately, many ancient Egyptian cultural relics have been stolen by imperialists. Once I met an Egyptian government official named "Rosetti", which in Arabic means "a person from Rosetta." Rosetta is a mouth of the Nile Delta and used to be a small village. In 1799, soldiers of Napoleon's invading army discovered a mysterious stone carved with ancient hieroglyphs and Greek characters. It was with the help of this strange stone that the secrets of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were revealed by scholars. However, such a treasure can only be seen as a replica in the Cairo Museum, and the original stone is still displayed in the London Museum. This "person from Rosetta" said painfully, "Unfortunately, we have gone through such a historical period, and our best historical relics have been stolen by the British, Americans, and French."

(V) The Luxurious Farouk Palace

When traveling to Egypt, people are interested in visiting the palace of Farouk, the deposed king of Egypt. Four years ago, these palaces were forbidden zones, and ordinary people could not enter. Now, these palaces have been opened to ordinary residents.

Abdeen Palace is Farouk's largest palace in Cairo. In addition to this palace, he has four other palaces in Cairo. Under the Pyramid of Khufu, Farouk built a new palace for himself to show his prominence. Abdeen Palace was built in 1874 during the reign of Isma'il Pasha of Egypt. Nearly a century ago, the construction of the palace cost 700,000 Egyptian pounds, and the furnishings and decorations in the palace cost about 2 million Egyptian pounds. Over the years, renovations and expansions have cost Egypt no less than 20 million Egyptian pounds.

Entering the palace, ascend the jade stone staircase to Farouk's reception room, then turn left to the dining room. The ceiling is made of brocade embroidered with four little angels. There are crystal-columned handrails on the corridor. The crystal was shipped from Turkey. The marble walls of Farouk's bathroom are inlaid with thick gold trim, and the marble floor is equipped with heating. There is also a dining room in the bathroom for snacks. There are nude paintings around the bathroom and other parts of the palace.

The Egyptians say that Farouk exploited the Egyptian people, especially the vast number of Egyptian farmers, to live an extravagant life, but he was like a lamb in front of foreign imperialists. In Cairo, it is often mentioned that in 1942 the British ambassador led hundreds of motorized armored troops into Abdeen Palace, ordering Farouk to sign an order to appoint a person who was satisfactory to the British at the time as Prime Minister of the Cabinet. Farouk was afraid of losing his throne and immediately succumbed to the British ambassador. This incident was a disgrace to the Egyptian people, but Farouk was not ashamed.

The calendar on the wall of the corridor of Abdeen Palace still shows July 26, 1952. This is a significant day. On that day, Farouk was driven out of Egyptian territory, and Farouk's calendar ended there. (Attached picture)

    （四）古埃及博物馆
    在尼罗河畔，有一个古埃及博物馆。这个博物馆可说是世界上有数的珍奇之一。博物馆建于1881年，馆内陈列着跨越三十多个世纪的古代埃及所遗留下来的六千余件文物。古代埃及自纪元前三千二百年美尼斯皇朝开始至纪元前三十年克里奥帕特拉女皇，共三十三代，每代都留下了许多文物。那里有埃及史前时期的陶器、石器，有埃及古代帝王的巨大的石像，帝王通信的纸草，还有许多保存了几千年的帝王及飞禽走兽的木乃伊。博物馆中还有古埃及时代所造的木船以及许多古埃及的艺术品。那里还陈列着1922年发现的古代帝王杜当哈蒙的完整的宏大的陵墓……。
    很可惜，许多古代埃及的文物已经被帝国主义分子盗走了。有一次我遇到一个埃及政府官员，他的名字叫“罗塞底”，阿拉伯文的意思是“从罗塞德来的人”。罗塞德是尼罗河三角洲上的一个入海口，过去是一个小村子。1799年拿破仑侵略军的士兵在那里发现了一块神秘的刻着古代象形文字和希腊文的怪石。就是借助于这块怪石，埃及古代象形文字的秘密才被学者们揭开了。可是这样一件珍品，现在人们在开罗博物馆却只能看到它的复制品，原石还陈列在伦敦博物馆。这位“罗塞德来的人”言下很痛心，他说：“很不幸，我们经过这样的历史时期，我们最好的历史文物都被英国人、美国人、法国人偷走了。”
    （五）奢华的法鲁克皇宫
    到埃及去旅行，人们都有兴趣去参观一下埃及被赶走了的国王法鲁克的皇宫。四年以前，这些皇宫是禁区，老百姓是无法进去的。现在，这些皇宫都已为普通居民开放了。
    阿勃丁宫是法鲁克在开罗的最大的一个宫。除了这个宫以外，在开罗他还有四个宫。在库夫金字塔下，法鲁克为自己建立了一个新宫以示他的显赫。阿勃丁宫建于1874年埃及伊斯迈皇朝时期。在近一世纪前，宫的建造花费了七十万埃镑，宫内的陈设和装饰品花费约二百万埃镑。历年来改建和扩建又花去埃及的财富不下二千万埃镑。
    进宫，沿玉石扶梯而上到法鲁克的接待室，再向左转到餐厅，房顶是锦缎绣成的四个小天使。走廊上有水晶柱的扶梯。水晶是从土耳其运来的。法鲁克的浴室的花纹大理石的墙壁上镶着粗阔的金边，大理石的地板下装有暖气设备。浴室内还有餐室，以备小吃。浴室周围及宫的其它地方都有裸女画。
    埃及人说，法鲁克对埃及人民，特别对广大埃及农民横暴榨取，供他过穷奢的生活，但在外国帝国主义面前都像羔羊。在开罗人们经常提到，1942年英国大使带着数百人的摩托装甲部队冲进阿勃丁宫，勒令法鲁克签署选派当时英国人所满意的人为内阁总理的指令。法鲁克害怕丢掉自己的皇位，立即向英国大使屈服。这件事对埃及人民来说是个耻辱，而法鲁克却不以为耻。
    阿勃丁宫的走廊的墙壁上仍然挂着1952年7月26日的日历。这是一个有意义的日子。就在那一天，法鲁克被赶出埃及国土，法鲁克的日历就到此结束了。（附图片）
