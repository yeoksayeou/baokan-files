Xinhua News Agency, August 15th—The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue on August 15, 1956. The full text is as follows:

Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a just action taken by Egypt to safeguard its sovereignty and independence; whether from a legal or moral standpoint, this action by Egypt is entirely justified. The Chinese government and people fully support the Egyptian government's just action to safeguard its sovereignty and independence.

The Egyptian people used their own blood and sweat to dig the Suez Canal on their own territory. All international treaties concerning the Suez Canal must recognize that the Suez Canal is an inseparable part of Egypt; the Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian company, subject to Egyptian laws and customs. As a sovereign and independent country, Egypt has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. For nearly a hundred years, colonialists have controlled the shares of this Egyptian company, using this company to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty and exploit the Egyptian people. In an era when the people of Asia and Africa have awakened, this situation cannot be allowed to continue.

In the joint statement issued by the United States, Britain, and France on August 2, the problem of the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was forcibly confused with the issue of freedom of navigation on this canal, attempting to use this as an excuse to maintain their colonial privileges and deprive Egypt of its sovereignty over the Suez Canal. This excuse is completely untenable. The Egyptian government has repeatedly stated that it guarantees respect for the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. Since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the freedom of navigation on the canal has not been affected in the slightest. These facts loudly refute the argument that the freedom of navigation on the canal is threatened.

However, the United States, Britain, and France are arrogantly applying pressure on Egypt. They have frozen Egypt's property and funds in their countries. They have mobilized armed forces, flaunting the use of force and engaging in threats of force. Their actions are not only a threat to Egypt alone, but also a threat to all countries that demand to break free from colonial rule and demand to safeguard their sovereignty and independence, and a threat to world peace and security. Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples cannot but strongly condemn this behavior that seriously violates the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law.

Without consulting with Egypt, the United States, Britain, and France decided to convene a London conference attended by twenty-four countries. According to the joint statement issued by the three countries, they attempted at this conference to impose upon other participating countries the so-called management arrangements for the Suez Canal under an international system, which had been unilaterally decided in advance. This method of international management is clearly an interference in Egypt's internal affairs and an infringement upon Egypt's sovereignty. Under such circumstances, Egypt's refusal to participate in this conference is completely understandable. At the same time, as pointed out by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, the Soviet government, and many other countries, many relevant countries have been excluded from this conference. The Soviet government specifically proposed that at least twenty-two other countries, including the People's Republic of China, should participate in discussions on issues related to the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. Regrettably, this reasonable proposal by the Soviet Union was not approved by the United States, Britain, and France. It is very clear that such a conference has no right to make decisions on the Suez Canal issue, and even less any right to discuss issues involving Egyptian sovereignty.

Asian and African countries unanimously declared at the Bandung Conference that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated rapidly. Asian and African countries also affirmed at the Bandung Conference the principle of resolving international disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The Chinese government firmly upholds these resolutions of the Bandung Conference. The Chinese government believes that Egypt's sovereign act of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company does not allow any foreign interference; the issue of freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal can be resolved through peaceful consultation. Britain and France previously took some relatively wise actions that were conducive to easing international tensions in this incident. The Chinese government hopes that Britain and France will treat the Suez Canal issue in this spirit. Any acts of force or interference will inevitably arouse the firm opposition of the Asian and African people and the people of the world, and will certainly not be beneficial to Britain and France.

The Egyptian government, in the spirit of the Bandung Conference, has proposed convening a conference with broad participation of relevant countries to review the Constantinople Convention and consider the conclusion of an agreement by all these countries to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. The Chinese government warmly supports the spirit of peaceful consultation fully demonstrated by Egypt's proposal and believes that this proposal is a reasonable way to resolve the complex situation arising from the Suez Canal issue.

### 我国政府就苏彝士运河问题发表声明  支持埃及召开广泛性国际会议的建议  谴责美英法三国威胁埃及和企图干涉埃及内政的行为

    我国政府就苏彝士运河问题发表声明
    支持埃及召开广泛性国际会议的建议
    谴责美英法三国威胁埃及和企图干涉埃及内政的行为
    新华社15日讯　中华人民共和国政府1956年8月15日发表关于苏彝士运河问题的声明。全文如下：
    埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，这是埃及为了维护自己的主权和独立而采取的正义行动；不论从法律上或道义上来说，埃及的这一行动都是完全正当的。中国政府和人民完全支持埃及政府这一维护自己主权和独立的正义行动。
    埃及人民用自己的血汗在自己的领土上开凿了苏彝士运河。一切有关苏彝士运河的国际条约都不能不承认，苏彝士运河是埃及不可分割的一部分；苏彝士运河公司是一个埃及公司，受埃及法律和习惯的管辖。作为一个主权和独立的国家，埃及完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有。近一百年来，殖民主义者控制了这个埃及公司的股票，通过这个公司，侵犯埃及的主权，剥削埃及的人民。在亚非人民已经觉醒的时代里，这种情况是不能容许继续下去的。
    美、英、法三国在八月二日发表的联合声明里，硬把苏彝士运河公司国有化的问题同这条运河的航行自由问题混淆起来，企图以此为借口，来维持它们殖民主义的特权，剥夺埃及对苏彝士运河的主权。这种借口是完全站不住的。埃及政府早已一再声明，保证尊重苏彝士运河的航行自由。自从苏彝士运河公司国有化以来，运河的航行自由丝毫也没有受到影响。这些事实响亮地驳斥了所谓运河的航行自由遭到威胁的论调。
    但是，美、英、法三国却横暴地对埃及施用压力。它们冻结了埃及在它们国家里的财产和资金。它们调动武装部队，炫耀使用武力，进行武力威胁。它们的这种行动不仅仅是对埃及一个国家的威胁，而且是对一切要求摆脱殖民统治、要求维护自己的主权和独立的国家的威胁，对整个世界和平和安全的威胁。亚非国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都不能不强烈地谴责这种严重违反联合国宪章和国际法准则的行为。
    美、英、法三国没有同埃及进行协商，就决定召集一个由二十四个国家参加的伦敦会议。根据三国发表的联合声明来看，它们企图在这个会议上，把事先片面决定的所谓在国际制度下对苏彝士运河的经营安排的办法，强加在其他参加国的身上。这种国际经营安排的办法，显然是对埃及内政的干涉，对埃及主权的侵犯。在这样的情况下，埃及拒绝参加这一会议是完全可以理解的。同时，正如印度尼赫鲁总理和苏联政府以及许多其他国家所指出，很多有关国家都被排除在这一会议之外。苏联政府并且具体提出，在讨论同苏彝士运河航行自由有关的问题的时候，至少还应该有其他二十二个国家参加，其中包括中华人民共和国。令人遗憾的是，苏联的这一合理的建议并没有得到美、英、法三国的赞同。很显然，这样的一个会议没有权利对苏彝士运河问题作出决定，更没有任何权利讨论涉及埃及主权的问题。
    亚非国家在万隆会议中曾经一致宣布，殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应该迅速予以根除的祸害。亚非国家在万隆会议中还曾经肯定了按照联合国宪章以和平方法解决国际争端的原则。中国政府坚决维护万隆会议的这些决议。中国政府认为，埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的主权行为是不容许任何外国进行干涉的；有关苏彝士运河航行自由的问题，是能够通过和平协商求得解决的。英国和法国在这次事件前，曾经采取过一些有利于和缓国际紧张局势的比较明智的行动。中国政府希望，英国和法国将本着这种精神来对待苏彝士运河的问题。任何武力威胁和武力干涉的行为将必然引起亚非人民和全世界人民的坚决反对，而且对于英国和法国来说，也决不会是有利的。
    埃及政府已经本着万隆会议的精神，建议召开由有关国家广泛参加的会议，以便审查君士坦丁堡公约，并且考虑由所有这些国家缔结一个协定来重新肯定和保证苏彝士运河的航行自由。中国政府热烈支持埃及这一建议所充分表现的和平协商的精神，并且认为这一建议是解决由于苏彝士运河问题而产生的复杂局势的合理途径。
