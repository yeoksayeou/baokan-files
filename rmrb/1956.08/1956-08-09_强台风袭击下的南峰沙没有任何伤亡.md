    Nanfeng Sandbar, opposite Chongming Island, is a small sand洲 (zhōu, islet, small island) six *li* long and one *li* wide. On the sandbar is an agricultural production cooperative of 483 households. The land here is fertile, free from drought and flood, and is a high-yield rice area in Chongming County. However, it is afraid of strong winds.

    The day before the twelve-level strong typhoon struck, gusts of wind and heavy rain rushed towards the small sandbar, and the farmers on the sandbar were filled with fear and unease. Just then, the sound of a motor came from the water. "Who's coming at this time?" People rushed to the port, surprised and delighted. It turned out that Ji Yongzhen, a member of the Chongming County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, had come with a work team. He announced to the crowd watching: We are here to share weal and woe with you. At this time, people excitedly spread the word: "Folks, there is hope, people from the county have come to give us guidance."

    The work team immediately organized the masses to launch a struggle against the wind and disaster. People quickly took action, some rushing to deal with the danger, some reinforcing houses, and the members living in the central area busily vacated their houses to receive people coming to take shelter from the wind. At this time, the wind became stronger and stronger, the sky became darker and darker, and the waves became higher and higher. The wind roared and the waves surged, as if to overturn the small sandbar. The work of rescuing people from houses on the dangerous dikes became more and more difficult. People stumbled when going out, slipped when walking, and raindrops hit their faces painfully like sand. The waves outside the dike rolled in as if to swallow people in one gulp, but everyone was desperately rescuing people and houses. Wang Decheng, a member of the work team, crawled to a small house on the dangerous dike wearing a sack and carried Wang Xueqiu, an old man in his seventies, to a safe area. Zhao Pinxiang helped the pregnant woman Huang Xiaoying out of the tilted house. Gong Xiaohuo, the production captain of the agricultural cooperative, disregarded the fact that the typhoon had ripped the roof off his own house, and instead helped the cooperative member Liu Fuqing reinforce his house. Communist Party member Lu Zhiliang also climbed walls and roofs to repair his neighbors' houses in the wind and rain.

    On the morning of the second day, the typhoon hitting Nanfeng Sandbar became stronger and stronger, and the tide did not recede for a long time. Eleven of the seventeen *wei* (enclosures, embankments) on the entire sandbar were damaged by the wind and waves, and three *wei* were breached. With strong wind, heavy rain, and high waves, Nanfeng Sandbar was teetering on the brink. At this time, Ji Yongzhen, a member of the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, suddenly developed a high fever, but he endured the pain and continued to direct the work team to carry out rescue work.

    Thanks to the concerted efforts of the cadres and the masses in fighting the disaster, there were no casualties in Nanfeng Sandbar this time. Only a dozen houses were blown down, and a few seedlings were flooded. In 1949, this small sandbar was also hit by a typhoon. That typhoon was smaller than this one, but more than forty people died, more than 150 houses were blown down, and all the rice seedlings were flooded.

    After the wind weakened, the cadres of the County Party Committee work team quickly organized the farmers to repair the damaged *wei* embankments. The work team members also went down to the *wei* and carried mud with the masses. Just as everyone was happily working hard, good news came: the pregnant woman Huang Xiaoying gave birth to a full-term son smoothly after being safely transferred. The members jumped up with joy upon hearing the news, and everyone clamored: no one died, but someone was added! The people of Nanfeng Sandbar are truly blessed.

    强台风袭击下的南峰沙没有任何伤亡
    新华社记者　邵琼
    南峰沙在崇明岛的对面，是一个有六里长一里宽的小沙洲，沙上有个483户人家组成的农业生产合作社，这里土地肥沃，旱涝无忧，是崇明县的水稻高产乡，但是，就怕大风。
    这次十二级强台风袭来的头一天，一阵阵狂风暴雨向小沙上扑来，沙上的农民心里充满了恐慌和不安。正在这时候；水面上忽然传来了马达的声音，“谁来了，在这时候？”人们又惊又喜的奔到港口去看，原来是中共崇明县委委员季永珍率领工作队来到了，他向围观的人群宣布：我们是来与你们共患难的。这时候人们激动地奔走相告：“乡亲们，有希望了，县里来了人，有人给我们拿主张了。”
    工作队马上组织群众展开防风抗灾的斗争，人们很快地行动起来，有的人抢险，有的人加固房屋，住在中心地带的社员忙着腾房子，接待来避风的人。这时风也越来越大，天也越来越黑，浪也越掀越高，风吼浪涌，像要把小沙一下掀翻，去险堤上房屋里救人的工作越来越困难了，出门跌跤，走路打滑，雨点像沙子一样打在脸上生痛，堤外浪潮像要一口把人吞掉一样卷进来，但是谁都是奋不顾身地救人救屋。工作队队员王德成，披着麻袋匍匐着奔到险堤上的小屋里，把七十多岁的老人王学耉背到安全地带，赵品祥搀扶着孕妇黄小英走出倾斜的房子；农业社的生产队长龚小火不顾台风揭走自己家里房屋的屋顶，却帮助社员刘福庆加固房屋。共产党员陆志良在风雨交加时，也爬墙上屋抢修邻居的房屋。
    二日早晨，袭击南峰沙的台风越来越强，潮水久久不退，全沙十七个圩有十一个被风浪打伤，三个圩决口，风大雨急浪高，南峰沙摇摇欲沉，这时候，中共县委委员季永珍却突然发了高烧，但他忍受着病痛，继续指挥工作队做抢救工作。
    由于干部和群众同心协力的进行了抗灾的斗争，这次南峰沙没有发生任何伤亡事件，只有十几间房子被风吹倒，少数禾苗被淹。1949年这个小沙也曾遭到一次台风袭击，那次台风比这次要小，但却死了四十多人，刮倒房屋一百五十多间，稻苗全被淹光。
    风力转弱以后，县委工作队的干部又迅速组织农民抢修被风浪打坏打伤的圩岸。工作队员也下圩和群众一起挑泥。正在大家嗨嗨嗬嗬干得欢的时候，喜讯传来，孕妇黄小英在安全转移以后，顺利地生下足月的儿子。社员们闻讯乐得跳起来，大家嚷嚷：没死人倒添人了，南峰沙的人真福气。
