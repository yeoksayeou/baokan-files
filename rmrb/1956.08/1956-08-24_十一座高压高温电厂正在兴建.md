Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd:

    All eleven high-pressure, high-temperature thermal power plants scheduled for construction during the First Five-Year Plan are now under construction.

    Most of these eleven thermal power plants are being built in China's new industrial bases. The total generating capacity of the eleven power plants will account for 32% of the total thermal power equipment capacity built during the Five-Year Plan. In addition to generating electricity, most of these power plants can also supply a large amount of heat energy.

    The Jilin Thermal Power Plant, which started construction earlier, had a set of power generation equipment put into production in early July. The Chengdu Thermal Power Plant, which started construction later, is also nearing completion of its employee dormitories and dedicated railway lines. The main plant building can be officially constructed in the fourth quarter of this year. The nine power plants distributed in Wuhan, Luoyang, and other places are also under full-scale construction and are expected to begin generating electricity next year.

    The construction of high-pressure, high-temperature power plants marks the development of China's power industry towards higher technical levels. These eleven power plants all adopt new technological achievements in the power industry. Because these power plants have very high thermal efficiency, the average amount of coal required to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity is 12-15% less than that of ordinary power plants. These high-pressure, high-temperature power plants also have special protection devices that general medium-pressure power plants do not have. The boiler's thermal instrumentation also uses the latest electronic automatic control, enabling staff to more accurately and promptly understand the entire operating situation and improve the safety and reliability of power generation.

    十一座高压高温电厂正在兴建
    新华社23日讯　规定在第一个五年计划期间建设的十一个高压高温火力发电厂，现在已经全部动工兴建。
    这十一个火力发电厂大部分建设在我国的新工业基地。十一个电厂的总发电容量将占五年计划期间建设的全部火力发电设备容量的32％。这些发电厂除了发电以外，大部分还能供给大量热能。
    开工较早的吉林热电厂，七月初就有一套发电设备投入生产。动工较迟的成都热电厂，职工宿舍和铁路专用线等工程，也都快要建设好了。到今年第四季度，主厂房可以正式施工。分布在武汉、洛阳等地的九个电厂，目前也都进行全面施工，预计在明年都可以开始发电。
    高压高温电厂的建设，标志着我国的电力工业正在向着更高的技术方向发展。这十一个电厂都是采用电力工业的新技术成就。由于这种电厂热效率很高，平均每发一度电所需的煤量，要比一般电厂节省12—15％。这种高压高温电厂还具有一般中压电厂所没有的特殊保护装置，锅炉的热工仪表，也都采用了最新式的电子自动控制，使工作人员能够更加正确及时地了解整个运行情况，提高发电的安全可靠性。
