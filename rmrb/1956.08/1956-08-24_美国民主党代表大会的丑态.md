Title: The Ugly Show of the US Democratic National Convention

    The American two-party election is like a "political farce," even the American bourgeois newspapers think so. For example, Reston, a famous commentator of "The New York Times," described the politicians at the recently held Democratic National Convention as "the most interesting, illogical, self-contradictory, argumentative, and noisy people in mankind." The following are reports from American bourgeois newspapers on some of the ugly scenes at the Democratic National Convention that has ended.

          Busy Buying Votes
    When the Democratic National Convention just opened, because Stevenson and Harriman had not received enough votes to be nominated, the campaign managers of both sides used methods of "coaxing, flattering, wooing, and enticing" in the suites, bedrooms, living rooms, and corridors of the big hotels in downtown Chicago, and launched a struggle to buy representatives' votes. The Associated Press cited a typical example. Someone told the head of a delegation from a western state on the phone: "Candidate ×× plans to help you raise a sum of money. Can you bring some representatives to see him?" As a result, the entire delegation went, and this secret deal was concluded.
      Various Campaign Methods
    People who canvassed for Kefauver believed that the hot weather was a factor that could be used. They sent three big barrels of iced beer to the venue. Those who drank the beer were all "enthusiastic" and cheered for Kefauver in unison. This method produced the "desired result."
    The Texas delegation held up the state flag, led by a band playing "The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You," and paraded in the venue to campaign for the state's Senator Lyndon Johnson. They "shouted strangely" within the twenty minutes allowed by the convention, and even exceeded the time by three minutes. This is a campaign method called "demonstration."
    Ingenious innovation is an important method in the campaign. A supporter of Kentucky Governor Chandler loudly touted this candidate, saying: "He is the commander-in-chief of the Kentucky Colonels." The Associated Press praised: This statement is "unmatched by any other representative."
      Big Bosses Don't Forget to Promote
    There was a special feature on the Democratic National Convention's television program. Viewers could see a tired representative sitting in a chair with his head resting on his hand, fast asleep. So capitalists expressed deep sympathy for the hardworking representatives. They gave all the representatives various over-the-counter medicines for free, including a sample of chewing gum that was said to relieve stomach pain.
    Strategy for Passing the Civil Rights Platform
    The Democratic Party's long-touted civil rights platform is an issue that the American people pay more attention to, but the content of this platform, as Associated Press reporter Marrow said, is just "pure political deception." But even passing such a civil rights platform that serves as a facade will encounter many objections. Therefore, the strategists of the convention came up with a way to drag the meeting into the late night. When many seats in the venue were empty, and some representatives who remained in the venue were also not paying attention, the platform was brought up. Therefore, the platform passed smoothly.

### 美国民主党代表大会的丑态

    美国民主党代表大会的丑态
    美国两党竞选犹如一场“政治闹剧”，这一点连美国资产阶级报刊也是如此认为的。例如，“纽约时报”著名评论员赖斯顿就形容新近举行的民主党大会的一批政客“是人类中最有趣、不讲逻辑、自相矛盾、好争论和爱吵闹的人们。”下面是美国资产阶级报刊对已经结束了的民主党代表大会上的一些丑态的报道。
          收买选票忙
    民主党代表大会刚开幕时，由于史蒂文森和哈里曼都未得到被提名的足够票数，双方竞选的经理人在芝加哥闹市的大旅馆的套房、卧室、客厅和走廊里，使用了“哄骗、谄媚、拉拢和利诱”的手段，展开了一场收买代表选票的斗争。美联社举了一个典型例子，有人在电话里告诉西部某州代表团团长说：“××候选人打算帮你筹划一笔款，你是不是可以带一些代表来见他？”结果整个代表团都去了，这场秘密买卖也就成交了。
      形形色色的竞选办法
    替克弗维尔拉票的人认定盛暑的天气是一个可利用的因素，他们送了三大桶冰镇啤酒到会场，喝了啤酒的人莫不“热情高涨”，齐声欢呼拥护克弗维尔，这个方法产生了“所希望的结果”。
    得克萨斯州代表团高举州旗，以吹奏着“得克萨斯的眼睛看着你”的乐队为先导，在会场游行来替该州参议员林顿·约翰逊竞选。他们在代表大会所允许的二十分钟内“怪声喊叫”，并且还超出了三分钟时间。这是一种叫做“示威性”的竞选方法。
    挖空心思地标新立异是竞选中一项重要的方法。一位肯塔基州州长昌德勒的支持者为这位候选人大声鼓吹说：“他是肯塔基州上校中的总司令。”美联社称赞说：这一种说法是“没有其他代表能与之匹敌的。”
      大老板们不忘推销
    民主党代表大会的电视节目里有一个特写镜头，观众可以看到一个疲倦的代表坐在椅子上把头靠在手上睡熟了。于是便有资本家对辛劳的代表们深表同情。他们免费送给全体代表各种成药，包括一种被介绍说可以止胃疼的口香糖的样品。
    通过民权纲领的战略
    民主党吹嘘已久的民权纲领是美国人民比较注意的问题，但是这个纲领的内容正像美联社记者马劳所说的，只是“纯粹的政治欺骗。”但是即使要通过这样一个充作招牌用的民权纲领也会碰到许多反对。因此，代表大会的战略家想出了一个办法，就是把会议拖到了深夜，当会场里许多位子是空的，仍然留在会场的一些代表也注意力不集中的时候才把纲领提出来，因此这项纲领很顺利就通过了。　（林）
