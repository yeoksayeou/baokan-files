Examining Our Subjectivist Work Style
Ge Runsheng, Secretary of the CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee

Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from the speech of the Secretary of the Nanchong Prefectural Committee at the Sichuan Provincial Party Congress. The problems identified here exist to varying degrees in some other regions as well. Such an examination is meaningful for understanding and changing certain subjectivist work styles of leadership that are divorced from reality.

Since last winter, Nanchong Prefecture in Sichuan, like other parts of the province, has experienced a magnificent upsurge in cooperation and production. This year's spring harvest increased by 22%, and the planting area for summer crops and rice exceeded any year since liberation, with crops generally growing well. Although the Jialing River area recently suffered severe flooding, it is still possible for the entire region to fulfill its annual plan for a 20% increase in production. In terms of sideline production, pig numbers have recovered and increased, and other livestock and poultry have also doubled. The entire countryside is showing many encouraging new features. However, there are also many problems in our work, some of which are quite serious. Upon examination, these mainly fall into the following areas:

I. We have many problems in caring about the well-being of the masses. The most prominent is the commercial problem, which has a significant impact on farmers' production and lives. For example, in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, unreasonable price regulations and the practice of downgrading and reducing prices have hit production hard, causing considerable losses to farmers. According to a survey in Cangxi County, there were 42 kinds of products that were downgraded and reduced in price during procurement, while 320 kinds of commodities were upgraded and increased in price during sales. Due to downgrading and price reductions by purchasing departments, the output of straw hats in Yingshan County in the first half of this year decreased by more than 200,000 compared with the same period last year. Mat production in Yuechi also decreased significantly due to downgrading and price reductions. The masses were dissatisfied and said: "We fear neither heaven nor earth, only the word of the inspector." Many commercial departments have complicated procedures, which cause a lot of inconvenience to the lives and production of the masses. For example, when farmers slaughter pigs, they must first inspect and register, then carry them to the slaughterhouse for slaughter, and then carry them to the tax office to have them stamped and taxed. The farmers are very angry with this back and forth. They said, "I will never raise pigs again in my life." Another example is the wood boat transport in Nanchong City. When a boat arrives at the dock, it must go through more than ten procedures at the navigation station, tax bureau, bank and other relevant departments from unloading to departure, delaying the departure for three days.

In the distribution of loans, grain loans, and public grain reductions and exemptions, the phenomenon of inaccurate loan and reduction targets occurred because the Party's policy of supporting poor farmers in production was not effectively implemented. Many who should have been given relief were not, those who should have received grain loans did not, and those who should have received reductions and exemptions did not. Also, because we once neglected the production of sideline industries and handicrafts, some farmers had their actual incomes reduced.

II. In formulating this year's agricultural production increase targets and measures to achieve them, there were problems of blindly pursuing quantity and speed without regard to actual conditions. For example, when we formulated this year's agricultural production increase plan, the Provincial Party Committee requested a 10% increase, but our Prefectural Party Committee initially wanted to increase it by 30%. Later, we found that this increase target was not realistic, so we revised it to 20%. Because the unrealistic production increase plan was revised from top to bottom, the workload and difficulties of the work were artificially increased, especially the workload of township and community cadres. For example, in terms of developing pig production, the Provincial Party Committee's seven-year plan required an 80% increase in pigs, but we wanted to increase it by more than double this year, striving to have an average of three pigs per household and one sow for every three households by the end of the year (at that time, there were only 1.24 pigs per household and one sow for every eleven households). In order to achieve this goal, many farmers rushed to buy piglets on the market. When some farms increased, others decreased, and in the end, it was still the same. The number of piglets did not increase, but the price rose a lot, from 30 or 40 cents per catty to 70 or 80 cents, or even one yuan. Although our starting point was good, we got such results because we did not conduct investigations and research, and did not proceed from reality.

III. We also have problems in promoting agricultural technology, such as transplanting mechanically without adapting to local conditions. This year, our region has promoted more advanced agricultural technologies, and although most were successful, some failed. For example, Yin Fang japonica rice was originally a good variety, but because we do not have so many self-fertilizing fields here, and coupled with the lack of technical conditions, most of the 100,000 mu of Yin Fang japonica rice in the entire region this year will suffer yield reductions. When promoting it, we only thought that japonica rice could yield 700 jin of grain per mu, and we felt that planting more would increase the yield more. The Provincial Department of Agriculture distributed more than one million jin of japonica rice seeds to us, and we still thought it was too little. In order to take care of key cooperatives and large cooperatives, we distributed most of the seeds to them, thinking that these cooperatives could become typical examples of promoting japonica rice in the future. In fact, no, the answer that reality gave to our subjectivism was ruthless. The grains per ear of the Yin Fang japonica rice planted here are not two hundred, but fifty or sixty, or even a dozen. Its yield is not 700 jin per mu, but 200 or 300 jin. The masses complained: "Last year, we suffered from drought, and this year, we suffered from japonica rice." Another example is late rice seedling cultivation. The Provincial Department of Agriculture originally introduced three methods, but we did not study and compare them well, so we asked the agricultural departments to notify the counties to adopt the dry water seedling cultivation method. Because the dry water seedlings grow too fast, the seedlings grow excessively, and the early rice has not yet been harvested, but the late rice seedlings are about to joint. Seedlings that have been jointed will reduce yield, and the masses are suffering, and the cadres are anxious. There are some similar problems in promoting other technologies.

The masses here are very happy with threshing machines, sprayers, and powder sprayers, and they ask for more supply, but we did not promptly report this to the higher levels, so we cannot meet their requirements. The masses here do not welcome new-style farm tools such as double-wheel double-铧 ploughs, double-wheel single-铧 ploughs, and disc harrows (because there are many hills and mountains in our region, and few plains and dams), but we have promoted a lot of them. As a result of blind promotion, those farm tools are placed in the community as "decorations."

The above-mentioned problems reflect our leadership's subjectivism and bureaucracy. In the cooperative movement, our minds were not calm enough. We always thought that grain production could be greatly increased in the first year of cooperation, and that sideline production could also be greatly increased. Therefore, in formulating agricultural production plans and in formulating certain measures to achieve the plans, the requirements were too high and too much. In this way, the phenomenon of excessive labor tension appeared. The masses have a lot of opinions on this. Some say, "Even the cattle have to rest," and some say, "Frogs have to stop after jumping three steps, let alone people."

After checking and summarizing these problems in leadership, we are determined to go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and change this subjectivist work style.

    检查我们的主观主义作风
    中共南充地委书记　戈润生
    编者按　这是南充地委书记在中共四川省代表大会上发言的摘要。这里所检查到的问题，在其他一些地区也程度不等地存在着。这样检查，对认识和改变领导上的某些脱离实际的主观主义思想作风是有意义的。
    四川南充地区自去年冬季以来，和全省各地一样，出现了规模壮阔的合作化高潮和生产高潮。今年小春作物增产22％，大春作物、水稻栽插面积超过解放以来任何一年，庄稼普遍生长良好。虽然最近嘉陵江沿岸遭受很大的洪灾，但全区完成全年增产20％的计划仍是有可能的。在副业生产上，猪已经恢复并有增加，其他家畜家禽也增加一倍左右。整个农村中出现了许多令人振奋的新气象。但是，我们的工作中的问题也是很多的，有的甚至很严重，检查起来主要有以下几方面：
    一、我们在关心群众生活疾苦上，存在着不少问题。最突出的是对农民生产、生活影响很大的商业问题。如在收购农副土特产品上，价格规定不合理，压级压价，打击生产，使农民遭受了不少损失。据苍溪县检查，在收购上有四十二种产品压级压价，而推销上有三百二十种商品抬级提价。营山的草帽，由于收购部门压级压价，今年上半年的产量比去年同期减少二十多万顶。岳池的席子因为压级压价也减产很多。群众不满意地说：“天不怕，地不怕，只怕验收员一句话。”很多商业部门的手续复杂，给群众生活生产上带来很多不便。如农民杀猪，要先检验登记，然后再抬到屠宰场宰杀，随后再背到税务所盖印完税。农民对这样来来去去很生气，他们说：“我二辈子也不养猪了”。又如南充市的木船运输，船到码头，从卸货到启程要去航管站、税务局、银行等有关部门办理十多道手续，耽误三天才能开船。
    在发放贷款、贷粮和公粮减免上，由于没有切实贯彻党的扶持贫苦农民生产的政策，因而发生贷款和减免的对象不准现象，不少应救济的没有救济，应该贷粮贷款的没贷给，应该减免的没有减免。还由于我们一度忽视副业、手工业的生产，一部分农民因此减少了实际收入。
    二、我们在制定今年农业增产指标和实现增产指标的措施上，存在着不根据实际条件盲目求多、求快的毛病。比如，我们在制定今年的农业增产计划时，省委要求增产10％，而我们地委开始竟要增产30％，后来发现这个增产指标不切合实际，才又修订为20％。由于从上到下修订这不合实际的增产计划，人为地增加了工作的分量和困难，特别是给乡、社干部增加了很大的工作负担。又如在发展生猪方面，省委的七年规划要求生猪增加80％，而我们却要在今年就增加一倍多，争取年底每户平均喂到三只猪，每三户一只母猪（当时每户平均才一点二四只猪，十一户才有一只母猪）。为要达到这一要求，许多农民都在市场上抢购小猪，此处增加，彼处减少，抢来抢去还是一样。小猪数量没有增加，价格却涨了不少，原来每斤三、四角，后来涨到七、八角，甚至一元。我们的出发点虽然是好的，但是由于不进行调查研究，不从实际出发，闹成这样的结果。
    三、我们在推广农业技术上也存在着没有因地制宜生搬硬套的毛病。今年我区推广的农业先进技术是比较多的，虽然大部成功，但有些则是失败的。比如银坊粳稻，本来是良种，但是由于我们这里没有那么多的自肥田，再加上没有技术条件，今年全区的十万亩银坊粳稻大部分要减产。在推广时，我们只想到粳稻每亩可收谷七百斤，觉得种得多增产就会多。省农业厅分给我们一百多万斤粳稻种子，我们还嫌少。我们为了照顾重点社和大社，就把大部分种子分给它们，以为这些社将来可以成为推广粳稻的典型。其实不然，事实给予我们的主观主义的回答是无情的。这里种的银坊粳稻的每穗颗粒不是二百粒，而是五、六十颗，甚至十几颗。它的产量，每亩不是七百斤，而是二、三百斤。群众埋怨说：“去年是背了天干的时，今年是背了粳稻的时”。又如晚稻育秧，省农业厅本来介绍了三种办法，而我们没有很好地研究比较就让农业部门通知各县采用育干水秧办法。因为干水秧生长太快，秧苗徒长，早稻还没有收获，而晚稻秧子快要拔节。拔了节的秧要减产，群众叫苦，干部着急。在推广其他技术上，也有一些类似的问题。
    我们这里的群众对打谷机、喷雾器、喷粉器是十分欢迎的，要求多多供应，但我们没有及时向上级反映，因此不能满足他们的要求。这里的群众不欢迎双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、圆盘耙等新式农具（原因是我区丘陵山地多，平原大坝少），但是我们却推广了不少。盲目推广的结果，那些农具却放在社里当作“摆设”。
    上述种种问题，反映了我们领导上的主观主义和官僚主义。在合作化运动里，我们的头脑有些不够冷静，总以为合作化的第一年粮食是能够大大增产的，副业也能够大大增加，因而在制定农业生产计划上和制定实现计划的某些措施上，要求过高过多。这样，随着就出现了劳力过分紧张的现象。群众对这是很有意见的，有的说，“就是牛也得歇一歇”，有的说，“青蛙跳三步，也要停一停，何况是人”。
    我们检查总结了领导上的这些问题以后，决心深入实际，深入群众，改变这种主观主义的作风。
