The Liberation brand trucks trial-produced by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began their first whole-vehicle structural destructive road driving test on the 11th.

At around 10 a.m., on the grass alongside a section of road outside Changchun City, selected as suitable for conducting destructive tests, stood Soviet experts, the heads of the Chinese Communist Party organizations, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the factory, and the personnel participating in the test. At this moment, the driver wearing a tanker's helmet climbed into the car, and the test began.

After the fully loaded truck sped through a bumpy section of road, it entered the more severely damaged test section at maximum horsepower. As the car crashed through the specially dug large and small pits one after another, the body swayed from side to side and bounced up and down, sending large rocks loaded on the truck flying high. When the truck rammed through two parallel large pits about forty centimeters deep, the hood bounced up. Under these conditions, the car passed through the test section and performed an emergency brake while driving at high speed. At this time, according to theoretical calculations, nearly 10,000 kilograms of inertial force rushed forward, but the car stopped immediately.

Under conditions not permitted by the design, the car completed the 390-meter-long test road in 43 seconds.

When the test ended at the scheduled time that afternoon, the car had traveled back and forth seven times, covering 13.9 kilometers. The testers conducted a final inspection on the spot and found that the degree of damage to many parts of the frame, body, and other structures had not exceeded the original estimates, and some structures that were expected to be damaged were not. This car will continue to be tested according to regulations. The test will not end until a major assembly fails to function normally. Then the car will be disassembled and carefully inspected.

Before this destructive test, the car had already undergone more than 2,300 kilometers of break-in and performance tests. Through the destructive test, the reliability and strength of the entire vehicle structure will be tested, the process and assembly quality of parts, assemblies, and the entire vehicle will be determined, and the causes of easy-to-break parts will be analyzed in order to obtain design data for improvement.

    解放牌汽车进行第一次破坏性试验
    新华社记者　康国志
    第一汽车制造厂试制的解放牌载重汽车，十一日开始进行第一次整车结构破坏性道路行驶试验。
    上午十时许，在长春市郊选定的一段合乎进行破坏性试验的道路两旁的草地上，站满了前来参观的苏联专家，工厂中的中共党组织、行政、工会、青年团负责人和参加试验的工作人员。这时，戴着坦克手戴的帽子的司机跨上了汽车，试验便开始了。
    满载的汽车以高速度冲过一段坎坷不平的道路以后，就用最大的马力开进路面更为恶劣的试验区段。汽车闯过分布着特地挖掘的一个接着一个的大小凹坑的时候，车身左右摇摆，上下颠簸，车上装的大块石头扬起多高。汽车猛冲过两个深约四十公分的平行大坑的时候，车头都颠起来了。汽车就在这种情况下，通过了试验区段，并且在高速度行驶中进行紧急刹车。这时，根据理论上的计算，约有近一万公斤的惯力向前冲去，然而汽车立即停住了。
    在设计所不允许的条件下，汽车用四十三秒钟跑完了这段长达三百九十公尺的试验道路。
    当天下午，在预定的时间结束试验的时候，这辆汽车已经来回往返了七次，行驶了十三点九公里。试验人员们当场进行了最后一次检验，发现车架、车厢等结构的许多零件的破坏程度没有超出预先的估计，预料中应该破坏的一些结构也没有破坏。这辆汽车按照规定，还要进行试验。要到有一个重要的总成不能正常工作的时候，试验才能结束。然后再拆开汽车，仔细进行检验。
    这辆汽车在这次破坏性试验以前已经经过了二千三百多公里的走合试验和性能试验。通过破坏性试验，将考验整车结构的可靠性和坚固性，判定零件、总成、整车的工艺和装配质量，分析零件易坏的原因，以便取得设计资料，进行改进。
