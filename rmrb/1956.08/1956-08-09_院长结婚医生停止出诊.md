    Hospital Director's Wedding Causes Doctors to Stop Seeing Patients
    Guo, Deputy Section Chief (concurrently County Health Director) of the People's Committee of Duolun County, Inner Mongolia, held a wedding ceremony in early July. In the days leading up to the wedding, the news spread throughout the city. The medical community even called on everyone to contribute one yuan as a gift for Deputy Section Chief Guo. During the two days of the wedding, the cadres of the health center were truly "overjoyed." Everyone was too busy to participate in the grassroots street election activities that they should have attended, and they had to send a representative instead. When people came to ask doctors to see patients, treatment was suspended because "Deputy Section Chief is holding a wedding ceremony."
    Originally, giving wedding gifts is a personal matter that should not be interfered with. However, the situation surrounding Deputy Section Chief Guo's wedding in Duolun County is worth studying. People should not ask whether Deputy Section Chief Guo should have kept the health center staff so "overjoyed" while organizing his wedding. People should first ask: Is it permissible for the health center staff to abandon patients for the sake of organizing the wedding?

    院长结婚医生停止出诊
    内蒙多伦县人民委员会郭副科长（兼县卫生院长）在七月上旬举行结婚典礼。在结婚的前几天，消息就传遍了全城。医药界还号召每人拿一元钱，给郭副科长送礼。结婚的那两天，真把卫生院的干部忙得“不亦乐乎”，大家连应该参加的街道基层选举活动都没空参加，只得派出一名代表。有人来请医生去看病，也因为：“副科长正在举行结婚典礼”而停止出诊。
    本来，结婚送礼都是用不到别人干涉的个人私事，然而像多伦县这一位郭副科长结婚时的情况，就大可研究。人们先不问郭副科长为了办喜事，应不应把卫生院的工作人员忙得“不亦乐乎”，人们首先要问：卫生院的工作人员为了办喜事，把病人丢开不管，这难道是允许的吗？
