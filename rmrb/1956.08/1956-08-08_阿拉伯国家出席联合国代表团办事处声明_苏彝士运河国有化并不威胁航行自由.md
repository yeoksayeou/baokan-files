Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from New York: The Arab States Delegation Office to the United Nations issued a statement on August 6th stating that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal does not constitute a threat to freedom of navigation.

The statement, issued in the form of a letter to all journalists at the United Nations, denounced Britain and France for fabricating the non-existent claim that freedom of navigation was threatened in order to protect their colonial interests. The statement pointed out that Egypt wants to use the nationalization of the Suez Canal to obtain funds for the construction of the Aswan High Dam, and it "naturally urgently hopes to facilitate and promote shipping, rather than reduce shipping through this great waterway."

Referring to the 24-nation conference on the Suez Canal issue proposed by Britain, France, and the United States, the statement said that some people are trying to "beg for support for the proposal to establish an international system to manage the canal, on the grounds that freedom of navigation can only be guaranteed through international control." The statement said: "What will the Americans think when someone now advocates that the internationalization system applied to the Suez Canal be expanded and applied to all waterways of international importance, including the Panama Canal?"

    阿拉伯国家出席联合国代表团办事处声明
    苏彝士运河国有化并不威胁航行自由
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：阿拉伯国家出席联合国代表团办事处在八月六日发表声明说，埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有并不构成对航行自由的威胁。
    这篇以致联合国各记者信的形式发表的声明，斥责英法为了殖民利益而制造出根本不存在的所谓威胁航行自由的说法。声明指出，埃及想靠苏彝士运河的国有化来获得修建阿斯旺高水坝的资金，它“自然迫切希望便利和促进航运，而不是减少通过这条大水道的航运”。
    声明在提到英法美三国所建议的讨论苏彝士运河问题的二十四国会议的时候说，有人正在努力“乞求别人支持设立一个国际制度来管理运河的主张，理由是只有通过国际控制才能保证航行自由。”声明说：“当有人现在主张对苏彝士运河实施的国际化制度扩大而应用于一切具有国际重要性的水道，包括巴拿马运河在内的时候，美国人将作何感想呢？”
