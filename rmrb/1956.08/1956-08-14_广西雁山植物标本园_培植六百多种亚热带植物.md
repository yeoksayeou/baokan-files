Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 12th - A type of tree called "Xian Gu" (Clam Bone), which sinks in water, has recently appeared in a botanical garden in Yanshan, Lingui County, Guangxi Province. This is a precious type of wood with a fine, solid texture and high utility value. The staff of the botanical garden transplanted it to the garden after discovering it in the wild in Guangxi Province.

This botanical garden cultivates over 600 plant species suitable for the subtropical climate of Guangxi Province. One of the plants in the garden, the "Fei Niu Shu" (Fat Cow Tree), is an evergreen tree from the mountainous areas of southern Guangxi. Its leaves are large and thick and can be used to feed cattle year-round. It is now being cultivated in Lingui in the north, providing excellent conditions for solving the problem of winter feed for cattle in the north. The botanical garden also cultivates "Shui Gou Er" (Water Dog), which can treat pig diseases, and "Kai Kou Jian" (Open Sword), which treats cattle diseases. There are also "Shui Shan" (Metasequoia) and "Cha Shu" (Sassafras) for construction, as well as the world-renowned Guangxi specialty - cinnamon, and "Luo Han Guo" (Monk Fruit) for treating sore throats.

All the plant specimens in the garden were collected by the staff working here from the remote forests and mountainous areas of Northeast China, Hainan Island, and Guangxi Province.

This botanical garden is managed by the Guangxi Branch of the South China Botanical Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In recent years, plant researchers have observed and studied the properties and ecology of plants suitable for growing in Guangxi Province, and have classified these plants to provide data for the future development of plant cultivation in Guangxi Province.

    广西雁山植物标本园
    培植六百多种亚热带植物
    新华社南宁12日电　放在水里会下沉的一种名叫“蚬骨”的树木，最近在广西省临桂县雁山的一所植物标本园里出现。这是一种珍贵的木材，质地细致坚实，使用价值很高。标本园的工作人员在广西省野外发现这种树木后，把它移植到园里来了。
    这所植物标本园里，培植着六百多种适合于亚热带气候的广西省生长的植物。园里的一种“肥牛树”，是广西南部山区的常绿树，叶大而厚，一年四季都可以喂牛，现在在北部的临桂培植起来，对解决北部耕牛冬季的饲料问题提供了很好的条件。植物标本园里还种植着能治猪病的“水狗儿”和医牛病的“开口剑”；也有建筑用的“水杉”、“察树”和驰名世界的广西省特产——肉桂以及医治喉痛的“罗汉果”等。
    园里所有的植物标本，都是在这里工作的人员到东北、海南岛和广西省内人迹罕到的林区、山区采集来的。
    这座植物标本园由中国科学院华南植物研究所广西分所管理。几年来植物研究工作者，在这里观察和研究了适合广西省生长的植物的性能和生态；并把这些植物加以分类，为今后广西省发展植物种植工作提供资料。
