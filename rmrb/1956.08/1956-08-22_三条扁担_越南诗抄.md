    Three Carrying Poles
    ——Vietnamese Poems
    Sun Bin
    Three girls participating in road construction
    All carry the same baskets,
    Like three sisters,
    Coming and going together.
    Under the fluttering headscarves,
    Three rose-colored faces,
    Three carrying poles on their shoulders,
    Gleaming, gleaming, becoming a single point.
    The railway is being renovated,
    Workers one after another,
    Transporting stones and soil to the construction site,
    The girls also come to participate.
    Buzz! The train is coming,
    The three girls also stop,
    Immediately setting off a burst of cheers,
    The girls' voices are the loudest.
    "Hello, Soviet elder brother!"
    "Hello, Chinese comrades!"
    Cheers and applause also come from the train,
    The small station is boiling.
    This train full of friendship,
    Brings infinite encouragement to the girls,
    Look at those three carrying poles,
    Gleaming, gleaming, becoming a single point…

    三条扁担
    ——越南诗抄
    孙滨
    三个参加修路的姑娘
    都挑着一样的箩筐，
    好像三个姊妹，
    来来往往都在一起。
    飘飘荡荡的头巾下，
    三张玫瑰色的脸儿，
    三条扁担在肩上，
    闪呀闪地闪成一个点。
    铁路在进行整修，
    工人们一个接着一个，
    把石料和泥土向工地运送，
    姑娘们也来参加。
    嗡！火车过来了，
    三个姑娘也都站下，
    登时掀起一片欢呼，
    姑娘们的声音最响。
    “苏联老大哥！你好！”
    “中国同志们！你好！”
    火车里也送来欢呼和鼓掌，
    小小的车站沸腾了。
    这满载着友谊的火车，
    给姑娘们带来无限的鼓舞，
    你看那三条扁担，
    闪呀闪地闪成一个点……
