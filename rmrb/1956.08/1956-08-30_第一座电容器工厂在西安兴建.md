Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 29th. China's first new factory producing power capacitors has officially commenced construction in Xi'an.

Once this factory is put into production, it will manufacture various high-quality capacitors for China's power industry. The function of this type of capacitor is to reduce power loss during transmission line journeys and improve power utilization rates.

According to the design, the factory's production system will be highly mechanized, with very little manual operation. For example, in the assembly workshop, three automatic conveyor belts form three work lines, and workers only need to stand at the assembly point to assemble the parts in sequence. The product that has completed the final assembly is suspended in mid-air by a crane in the painting workshop, and the automatic painting station quickly paints it evenly and beautifully; after passing through a conveyor belt in the drying room, the paint will be completely dry. The factory also has a workshop specifically for trial-producing new products, including a complete set of equipment, so that trial production work and formal production do not interfere with each other. In addition, all the factory buildings have earthquake-resistant performance and proper fire-fighting equipment. Most of the equipment and machines in this factory are supplied by the Soviet Union.

In the past, China did not have a power capacitor industry like this. The capacitors needed by domestic power plants, substations, and transmission lines were mostly ordered from abroad. However, this could not meet the needs of the power industry, so many places where capacitors should have been used were not, resulting in a very low power utilization rate and a waste of a lot of electricity. Once this power capacitor factory is put into production, it can gradually solve this problem.

### 第一座电容器工厂在西安兴建

    第一座电容器工厂在西安兴建
    新华社西安29日电　中国第一座生产电力电容器的新型工厂已经在西安正式动工兴建。
    这座工厂投入生产以后，将为中国电力工业制造各种质量良好的电容器。这种电容器的功能是减少输电线路途中的电力损耗，提高电力的利用率。
    根据设计，这座工厂的生产体系是高度机械化的，很少有手工操作。例如在装配车间有三条自动传送带形成三条工作线，工人只要站在装配地点就可以顺序把部件装配好。完成总装配的产品在喷漆车间被吊车悬在半空，自动喷漆台就很快把它喷得均匀漂亮；再经过在干燥室里一条传送带上走一趟出来，油漆也就全干了。这座工厂还设有一个包括全套设备的专门试制新产品的车间，使试制工作和正式生产互不干扰。此外，全厂建筑都有防地震的性能和妥善的防火装置。所有在这座工厂里的设备和机器大部是由苏联供应。
    中国过去没有像这样的电力电容器工业。而国内发电厂、变电站和输电线路需用的电容器，大都是向国外订货。但这并不能满足电力工业的需要，所以很多应该使用电容器的地方都没有应用，致使电力的利用率很低，白白浪费了许多电力，这座电力电容器厂投入生产以后便可以逐步解决这个问题。
