    On the Lyrics of the "Red Army Base Area" Chorus
    Zhang Yongmei
    The theme of the "Red Army Base Area" Chorus is vast and complex. The lyricist, Comrade Jin Fan, did not predefine a framework for this vastness and complexity; instead, he was true to life, starting from his own feelings when visiting the base areas. He wrote down whatever he felt. The most touching things in the struggle are often both representative and specific. The sections included in the lyrics (1. The Storm of Revolution. 2. Sending a Husband to Join the Red Army. 3. Children's Corps Sentry Song. 4. The Long March Troops Have Left. 5. Remembering Chairman Mao. 6. The Red Army Returns. 7. Dear Party, Glorious Party) are precisely those that have the characteristics of the base area, and can express the key points of the base area struggle. They are the "fountainhead" of poetry, thus arousing the waves of poetry, making it singable.

    The author starts with "The Storm of Revolution," first giving people a sense of the rising storm, laying the foundation for this chorus. Then, it transitions to the beautiful and lyrical "Sending a Husband to Join the Red Army," like a vast river with ten thousand waves, which, although the wind and waves have subsided, still flows continuously. Next is the lively and jumping "Children's Corps Sentry Song," like vibrant waves, happily bouncing. "Remembering Chairman Mao" is so powerful, giving people a deep infection. When the "Red Army Returns," it restores the grandeur of the "Storm of Revolution," even braver and more confident. Reaching "Dear Party, Glorious Party" is like the river flowing into the ocean, grand and solemn, vast and boundless. The structure is closely complete, but also tortuous and beautiful.

    This lyric also has shining points in the shaping of images.

    The newly made straw sandals embroidered with a red star,
    Given to my brother with deep affection,
    Wear them when climbing mountains and crossing rivers,
    Bravely kill the enemy in the hail of bullets.

    It is as if a beautiful image of a woman holding straw sandals and sending her husband to join the army stands before you, audible and tangible. Unfortunately, the last two sentences fail to carry through this beautiful and moving image to the end, becoming preachy and falling into clichés. "Husband joins the Red Army, wife tills the land, a happy life forever" deviates from the specific emotions of the people; a wife's feelings when saying goodbye to her husband are much more delicate and profound than this.

    In the "The Red Army Returns" section, the poet writes:

    Brush the mud off the wall,
    Let the slogans of that year reappear...
    Take out the teacup that Chairman Mao used,
    Take out the weapons buried in the vegetable garden,
    Dear ones, dear ones, this is our heart!

    The reason for collecting the teacup used by Chairman Mao in those years was to pour tea to welcome the reunion today, and burying the weapons for killing the enemy was to continue fighting. Here, the image of the people in the base area is summarized at a higher level.

    The "Red Army Base Area" Chorus is poetry, but it is not completely the same as poetry for reading only, because it mainly exists as lyrics. This requires a very clear musicality and comprehensibility in terms of phonology, rhythm, and form. The author has also achieved certain accomplishments in mastering the characteristics of lyric writing. It is repeated and chanted in places where it is needed, and a rapid rhythm is adopted; it is convenient for composition and can also enhance the audience's impression (song is an art of time, if the audience does not pay attention, it will slip away and never come back). In the "Children's Corps Sentry Song" section, there is "Little rooster, little rooster, standing under the red flag and crowing... Red Army brother, we salute you." The rhythm is lively and bright, rich in folk ballad color, the lyrics themselves contain a certain musicality, and it is very properly combined with the image of the Children's Corps.

    As a lyric lover, I am very happy to hear good songs such as the "Red Army Base Area" Chorus during Music Week, and I have learned a lot. Because, we need good lyrics, comrades, we also need to pay attention to lyrics!

    谈“红军根据地”大合唱的歌词
    张永枚
    “红军根据地”大合唱的主题是巨大的，复杂的。歌词作者金帆同志并没因了这巨大、复杂预先给定下一个框框；而是忠实于生活，从自己在访问根据地的感受出发，有什么感受写什么，大凡斗争中最感人的东西，常常就是有代表性而又具体的东西。歌词中所包括的几节（一、革命的风暴。二、送郎当红军。三、儿童团放哨歌。四、长征的队伍走了。五、怀念毛主席。六、红军回来了。七、亲爱的党，光荣的党），正是具有根据地特点，而又能表现根据地斗争的关节，是诗的“喷泉口”，因而激起了诗的波涛，能够咏唱。
    作者以“革命的风暴”为开头，先给人以风起云涌的气势，奠定了这个大合唱的基础。接着转入了优美抒情的“送郎当红军”，好比波涛万丈的大江，虽息了风波，但仍在不停地流淌。继之是活泼跳跃的“儿童团放哨歌”，就像富有生命力的浪花，在快乐地跳荡。“怀念毛主席”是这么富有力量，给人以深刻的感染。到“红军回来了”又恢复了“革命的风暴”的气派，更勇敢、更有信心。到“亲爱的党，光荣的党”如同大江流进了海洋，洪大庄严，广阔无边。结构是紧密完整的，也是曲折优美的。
    这歌词在形象的塑造上，也有闪光的地方。
    新打的草鞋呀绣红星，
    送给哥哥情意深，
    爬山过河你穿着走，
    炮火里面你勇敢杀敌人。
    好像有一个手拿草鞋，送郎参军的妇女的美丽形象，站在你的面前，能听得见，能摸得着。可惜在结尾两句，未能把这一优美动人的形象贯穿到底，流于说教，落了老套。“郎当红军女种地，幸福生活万年长”脱离了具体的人的情感；妻子送别丈夫时的心情，比这要细致深刻的多。
    在“红军回来了”一节中，诗人这样写道：
    把墙上的泥巴刷去，
    让当年的标语重新出现……
    拿出毛主席用过的茶杯，
    拿出埋在菜园地下的武器，
    亲人啊，亲人，这就是我们的心！
    当年收藏起毛主席用过的茶杯，是为了今日的重逢斟茶相迎，埋好杀敌的武器，是为了继续作战。在这里，较高地概括了根据地人民的形象。
    “红军根据地”大合唱是诗，也不完全同于只供阅读的诗，因为它主要还是作为歌词而存在的。这就要求在音韵、节奏、形式上，有非常鲜明的音乐性、易解性。作者在掌握歌词创作的特点上，也是有一定成就的。需要的地方予以反复吟咏，采取急促的节奏；作曲既方便，还能增强听众的印象（歌曲是时间的艺术，听众一不注意，就滑过去再不回来了）。在“儿童团放哨歌”一节里，有“小公鸡，小公鸡，站在红旗下面喔喔啼……红军哥哥，我们向你敬个礼。”节奏活泼明快，富有民谣色彩，歌词本身就孕育了一定的音乐性，而又同儿童团这一形象结合得非常妥当。
    作为一个歌词爱好者，能在音乐周听到“红军根据地”大合唱等好的歌曲，学习了不少东西，也很高兴。因为，我们需要好的歌词，同志们，我们还需要重视歌词！
