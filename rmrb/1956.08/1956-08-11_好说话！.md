    "Easy to Talk To!"
    Gu Xuejie
    A cadre wage conference of a certain government organ was held in the conference room.
    Chief A: I think the talent of cadres is certainly important; but "virtue" is still the most important standard. For example: Zhang ×× has some ability in his work, and you can even say his ability is relatively strong; however, he has one major problem! … Hey!
    Director A: He's "easy to talk to!" I completely agree with Chief A's opinion; we can't give Zhang...
    Chief B: I think Li ×× is a very good cadre, quiet and respectful, and does whatever the leadership says.
    Director B: I completely agree with Chief B's opinion; and I would add: I suggest promoting Li two grades.
    Unanimously approved.

    “好说话！”
    顾学颉
    某机关的干部工资会议在会议室举行了。首长甲：我认为干部的才能固然要紧；但“德”还是最重要的标准。例如：张××在工作上是有些能力的，甚至可以说能力比较强；但是，他有一个最大的毛病！……嗳！主任甲：他，“好说话！”我完全同意甲首长的意见；不能给张……。首长乙：我认为李××是个很好的干部，不声不响，毕恭毕敬，领导上说什么是什么。主任乙：我完全同意乙首长的意见；还补充一点：建议把李提升两级。
    全体一致通过。
