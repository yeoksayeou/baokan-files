Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 21st: Counties in Heilongjiang Province affected by floods along the river are organizing farmers to rescue farmland and develop sideline production. After taking active measures such as drainage, supporting seedlings, and washing seedlings, some of the affected farmland can still have varying degrees of harvest. In Wuchang County, which was affected by mountain floods and the Lalin River floods, farmers vigorously drained water after the floods receded. Ten districts alone rescued more than 3,000 hectares of farmland. Farmers in Zhaodong County have taken measures such as digging drainage ditches, building dams, and digging water storage pits for flooded farmland. The Hexi, Yongfa, and other three agricultural cooperatives alone can save 500 hectares of green seedlings. Of the more than 49,000 hectares of crops waterlogged in Qinggang, Qing'an, Suihua, and other counties, half can be harvested to some extent after the rescue efforts of 110,000 farmers.

Farmers in the disaster areas have found many ways to develop sideline production. Three agricultural cooperatives in Shuangqiao Township, Wuchang County, have found four types of sideline production, such as cutting sheep grass and thatch, which are estimated to generate more than 35,000 yuan in income within three months. At the same time, the family members of these cooperative members have received assistance from the cooperatives to develop poultry farming. More than 1,100 farmers in the disaster area of ​​Tangyuan County have gone to mountainous areas or non-disaster areas to engage in sideline production. The Yilan County leading organs have found six ways for disaster victims to develop sideline production, and are preparing to organize 2,000 people to participate in production, which is expected to generate more than 100,000 yuan in income within two months.

Since August, while vigorously strengthening flood control work, the leading organs of many counties have assigned special personnel to be responsible for leading the disaster victims in production for self-relief. Shangzhi County is sending more than 100 cadres to 25 disaster-stricken townships to help disaster victims develop sideline production. Tangyuan County has also established a leading group for production self-relief.

    黑龙江省遭受水灾各县
    积极抢救农田开展副业生产
    新华社哈尔滨21日电　黑龙江省沿江遭受水灾的各县组织农民抢救农田和开展副业生产。部分受灾农田在采取排水、扶苗、洗苗等积极措施后，还可以有程度不同的收成。受山洪和拉林河洪水为害的五常县，农民在洪水归槽后大力排水，仅十个区就抢救了三千多公顷农田。肇东县农民对被淹农田采取挖顺水沟、修水坝、挖储水坑等办法，仅河西、永发等三个农业社就可以救出五百公顷青苗。青冈、庆安、绥化等县受涝的四万九千多公顷庄稼，经过十一万农民的抢救，有一半可以得到一定的收成。
    灾区农民找到的副业生产门路很多。五常县双桥乡的三个农业社找到打羊草、打茅柴等四种副业生产，估计三个月内就可以收入三万五千多元。同时，这些社的社员家属得到社里帮助，发展饲养家禽。汤原县灾区农民已有一千一百多人到山区或非灾区从事副业生产。依兰县领导机关已经为灾民找到六种副业生产门路，准备组织两千人参加生产，预计他们在两个月内就可以收入十多万元。
    八月以来，各地在大力加强防汛工作的同时，许多县的领导机关都指派了专人负责领导灾民生产自救。尚志县正派出一百多名干部到二十五个受灾乡去，帮助灾民发展副业生产。汤原县也成立了生产自救领导小组。
