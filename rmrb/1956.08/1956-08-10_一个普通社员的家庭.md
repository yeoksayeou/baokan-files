In late July, I visited the home of Zhang Tingxiu, a commune member of the Tuanxi Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, Hunan Province. Zhang Tingxiu, an old man in his fifties, is still very healthy. He received me warmly.

Zhang Tingxiu knows how to make firecrackers and is now in the sideline occupation group of the Tuanxi Cooperative. He told me that because he has some skills, the cooperative takes care of him because of his age and does not ask him to participate in field labor. One of his younger brothers and his son participate in field production within the cooperative.

What changes has cooperation brought to the life of this ordinary farming family?

The house the family lives in is not too new, but it is very spacious, with a total of four rooms. I looked up and saw a piece of red paper pasted on the wall facing the entrance of a bedroom, with the four characters "新婚之禧" (Xin Hun Zhi Xi, Congratulations on the Wedding) written on it. The red paper was still very bright and new. The old man told me that this was his son's bedroom, and he had only gotten married last month. Now, his son and daughter-in-law have not yet returned home. The old man invited me to sit inside. This bedroom was indeed still full of the joy of a newlywed couple. The room contained red chests for storing clothes and tall cabinets. The bed was hung with a snow-white mosquito net, and the quilt on the bed was made of brand-new floral fabric. On the washstand next to the table was an enamel washbasin with peony flowers. In addition to a mirror and some decorations, there were also several volumes of junior high school textbooks and unfinished notes scattered on the table.

The old man told me that his son is now the cooperative's pumping machine operator. He was sent by the cooperative to a training class in Changsha City last year to learn the trade. Now it has not rained in the countryside for more than twenty days. These days, his son has been busy taking care of the machine and pumping water into the paddy fields from morning to night. His daughter-in-law is a graduate of senior primary school. Because the family has a lot of labor and the money is abundant, they decided to let her go to high school in the county this autumn.

When talking about the family's income, the old man said with a smile that last year was the first year his family joined the elementary cooperative. In that year, he became a surplus grain household for the first time in his life, whereas in the past he had always been short of grain every year. This year, because the elementary cooperative has been transformed into an advanced cooperative, the average yield per mu of early rice has increased by more than 10% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, in the summer harvest pre-distribution, his younger brother and son alone received 4,100 catties of rice for their workdays, an increase of more than 1,000 catties compared with the summer harvest pre-distribution of early rice last year. In addition, the old man himself makes firecrackers in the sideline occupation group, and he has pre-received more than 100 yuan in cash by the time of the summer harvest pre-distribution.

The old man said: "The above is all the labor income in the cooperative, and the income from family sideline occupations has not been included." When the old man calculated the family's sideline occupation income, he led me to see his pigsty. He said with emotion: "Comrade: This current pigsty used to be the house where our whole family lived! Now it has become a pig pen!" According to the old man, the house he lives in now was only available in the first year after joining the cooperative. It was originally built as four new houses elsewhere. Because Zhang Tingxiu wanted to be connected to his old house, he exchanged it with others.

I also asked Zhang Tingxiu how he planned to spend his summer harvest pre-distribution income this year. Zhang Tingxiu said that in addition to keeping grain for food, he planned to sell the rest of the grain and deposit most of the cash into the credit cooperative, because the family does not need to add anything for the time being. He only plans to keep some pocket money and sew a few floral cloth clothes for his daughter-in-law who is about to go to school in the city. He said: Now the family eats white rice every meal, and they can often eat preserved fish and preserved meat. As for the clothes for the four seasons, almost everyone has two or three sets.

When the old man introduced the current living conditions to me, he could not help but describe his past experiences. His family used to be a poor peasant family. Before liberation, in order to repay debts, they sold their only two mu of land. He had to rely on making firecrackers with his mother and wife to make a living. After liberation, his family was allocated five mu and two fen of land, but they lacked oxen, farm tools, and fertilizer. The harvest was not good, and the grain harvested each year was only enough to eat. In the spring of 1954, Zhang Tingxiu's mother died, and the burial cost alone cost more than 70 yuan, selling most of the year's food rations. They relied on government loans to buy grain to get through the difficulties.

Unknowingly, I had been sitting in Zhang Tingxiu's house until it was time to light the lamps. At this time, Zhang Tingxiu's son, Zhang Qingzhu, and daughter-in-law, Chen Guiyun, returned from the pumping station. Zhang Qingzhu was holding two books in his hand. I asked to take a look. It turned out to be "Pumping Machine Technology Training Materials," which talked about the structure and principles of the machine. He said: "Before liberation, I had no chance to go to school. I only had some culture after liberation by studying hard in the private school. Later, I participated in the pumping machine training class. These books were really difficult to understand at first, but after I studied the machine and looked at the principles explained in the book, I figured out about 80% of it. Now, it's not just me who is studying. There are also several young people in the cooperative who study with me every night."

His wife, Chen Guiyun, was busy packing her luggage, preparing to go to the county tomorrow to take the junior high school entrance examination. Zhang Qingzhu pointed to his wife and said to me quietly: "I asked her if she would like to work in the countryside with me in the future. She said that she wants to go to agricultural school in the future and come back to be an agricultural technician in the cooperative."

### 一个普通社员的家庭

    一个普通社员的家庭
    新华社记者　马钟明
    七月下旬一天的下午，记者访问了湖南省醴陵县氽溪农业社社员张庭秀的家。张庭秀，一个有五十多岁的老人，身体还很健康。他热情地接待了我。
    张庭秀会做爆竹，现在在氽溪社的副业小组里。他告诉我：自己有些手艺，社里为了照顾他上了年纪，不叫他参加田间劳动了。他的一个弟弟和儿子是在社内参加田间生产的。
    合作化对这一户普通农家的生活带来了怎样的变化呢？
    这个家庭住的房子并不算太新，但却很宽畅，一共有四间，我抬头看见一间卧室的迎门壁上贴着一幅红纸，上写着“新婚之禧”四个大字。红纸还很新艳。老人告诉我这是他儿子的卧室，上个月才结的婚。现在，儿子和媳妇都还没有回家。老人请我到里面坐坐，这间卧房里真的还充满着新婚的喜气。房里放置着盛衣物的红色箱子和高大的柜橱，床上挂着雪白的蚊帐，床上的被子全是崭新的花布做的。靠桌子旁边的洗脸架上放的是带牡丹花的搪瓷脸盆。桌子上除了一面镜子和一些摆设以外，还散放着几册初级中学的课本和没有写完的笔记。
    老人告诉我，他的儿子现在是社里的抽水机手，是去年被社里派到长沙市训练班学会的。现在乡里已有二十多天没有下雨了，这几天每天从早到晚，儿子都在忙着照管机器往稻田里抽水。媳妇是一个高小毕业生，因为家里不少劳动力，钱也宽裕，决定今年秋天让她到县里去读中学。
    当谈到这一家收入的时候，老人笑着说：去年，是他家参加初级社的头一年，就在这一年，他一生中第一次成为余粮户，而过去都是年年缺粮的。今年，因为初级社转成了高级社，早稻平均每亩产量又比去年同期增加一成以上。因此在夏收预分中，仅他弟弟和儿子做的劳动日，就分到四千一百斤稻谷，比去年早稻夏收预分增加了一千多斤，另外，老人自己在副业小组做爆竹，到夏收预分时止，也预支到一百多元的现金。
    老人说：“上面的这些还都是在社里的劳动收入，家庭副业收入还没有算在内。”老人给我计算家庭副业收入的时候，领我看了他家的猪舍，他感慨地说：“同志：这间现在的猪舍，过去是我们全家住的房子呢！现在它变成了猪栏了！”据老人说，现在他家住的房子是在入社后第一年才有的。原是在别的地方盖了四间新屋。因为张庭秀想和自己的旧屋连在一起，就和别人调换了。
    我又问起张庭秀今年夏收预分的收入准备怎样支出。张庭秀说，分得的粮食除留口粮外，准备卖掉，把这些现款大部存入信用合作社，因为家里暂时不需要再添置什么东西了。只打算留些零花钱和给就要进城上学的儿媳缝几件花布衣裳。他说：现在家里吃的餐餐是白米，还能经常吃到腊鱼、腊肉。至于四季穿的衣服，差不多每人都有两三套。
    当老人向我介绍现在的生活情况的时候，总禁不住叙述着他过去的经历。他家过去是户贫农，解放前为了还债，把仅有的两亩田也卖掉了。他只有带着母亲、妻子一起靠做爆竹糊口，解放后，他家分到了五亩二分田，但是缺少耕牛、农具和肥料，收成不好，每年收的粮食仅是够吃的。1954年春天，张庭秀母亲死了，埋葬费一次就花了七十多元，把当年的口粮大部卖掉了。靠政府借贷买了粮食才过了难关。
    我在张庭秀家里不知不觉已经坐到了掌灯的时候。这时张庭秀的儿子张庆祝和儿媳陈桂云从抽水机站回来了。张庆祝手里拿着两本书。我要求看一看，原来是“抽水机技术训练教材”，里边讲的全是机械的构造和原理。他说：“我解放以前，没有机会上学，都是解放以后靠在民校里用功读书才有了些文化的。后来又参加抽水机训练班学习。这些书刚看起来确是很难懂，但是我研究一下机器，再看看书上讲的道理，捉摸着也懂了个八成。现在不只我一个人学习，社里还有几个青年每天晚上也跟我一起学习。”
    他的爱人陈桂云这时正忙着整理行装，准备明天就到县里投考初中。张庆祝指着他爱人悄悄地对我说：“我问她将来愿不愿和我一起在农村工作。她说她将来要上农业学校，回来当个合作社的农业技术员。”
