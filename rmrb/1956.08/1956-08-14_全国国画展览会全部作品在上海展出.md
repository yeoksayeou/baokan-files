Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: All the works from the Second National Chinese Painting Exhibition opened at the Shanghai Art Museum on the 10th.

The exhibition in Shanghai includes 944 works by more than 760 artists from all over the country. This number is almost four times the number of exhibits in the first National Chinese Painting Exhibition. Some of these works were exhibited in Beijing in July.

Famous old painters, young painters, as well as artists from fraternal nationalities, returned overseas Chinese, and amateur workers all have works participating in the exhibition this time. Among them, the old painter Chen Banding's "Flourishing", uses the traditional techniques of national painting to express the beautiful scene when a hundred flowers are blooming. Nong Shiying, a young Zhuang artist, used only a few light strokes in "Pond Loach" to express the active posture of the fish. Ye Qianyu's "Boloer Dance" captured a momentary dynamic of an Indian dancer's performance, painting a beautiful and moving dance posture. Huang Zhou's "Appointment" depicts the scene of a rural young couple meeting, the characters' expressions are shy and bashful, successfully expressing the theme of the painting. There are also many works reflecting industrial and agricultural construction and depicting the magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland. For example, Yang Jianhou's "Yangtze River Sinking Raft Project" depicts the magnificent scene of the broad masses of workers fighting bravely against the flood when the Yangtze River flood hit the Nanjing port embankment in 1954.

Before the opening of the exhibition, Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Mayor of Shanghai, spoke to more than 100 painters. He expressed his hope that the various schools of Chinese painters would cooperate with each other; that Chinese painters should actively participate in political activities, learn from outstanding foreign painting art, and strive to prosper Chinese painting.

The exhibition is scheduled to end at the end of August.

    全国国画展览会全部作品在上海展出
    新华社上海11日电　第二届全国国画展览会的全部作品，十日在同时开放的上海美术馆开始展出。
    这次在上海展出的是全国各地七百六十多个作者创作的九百四十四件作品。这个数字将近第一届全国国画展览会展品数字的四倍。这些作品中的一部分七月间曾在北京展出。
    著名老画家，青年画家以及兄弟民族、归国华侨和工人业余作者这次都有作品参加展出。其中如老画家陈半丁的“欣欣向荣”，运用民族绘画传统的技巧，表现了百花竞开时的美丽图景。僮族青年作者农世英的“塘角鱼”，只是淡淡几笔，就把鱼儿活跃的姿态表现出来了。叶浅予的“波罗尔舞”，抓住了印度舞蹈家表演时一刹那的动态，画出了美妙动人的舞姿。黄胄的“约会”，描写一对农村青年会面的情景，人物表情靦覥羞涩，成功地表达了这幅画的主题。反映工农业建设和描绘祖国壮丽河山的作品，也不少。如杨建侯的“长江沉排工程”，描绘了1954年长江洪水冲击南京港堤岸时，广大工人奋勇同洪水作斗争的雄伟场面。
    在展览会开幕前，国务院副总理、上海市市长陈毅向一百多个画家讲了话。他希望国画家中的各种派别要互相合作；国画家们要积极参加政治活动，学习外国优秀的绘画艺术，为繁荣中国绘画而努力。
    展览会预计到八月底结束。
