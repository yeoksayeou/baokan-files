　　The breach of the Weiyun River on August 7 in Guantao and Linqing counties, Shandong Province, has flooded 1.5 million mu of land in Guantao, Linqing, and Wucheng counties, affecting over 400,000 people. Local party and government leading bodies are taking emergency rescue measures.

　　The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have dispatched rescue and慰问團 (comfort) groups to the disaster areas twice, each consisting of over 100 people. The State Council has also sent two transport planes to assist in the relief of the affected people. On August 14, 40,000 jin of cooked food was delivered to the people in the disaster area. The Shandong Provincial People's Committee has already distributed over 300,000 yuan in relief funds.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, August 18th: The southern counties of Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, are making every effort to fight the floods.

　　After the Weiyun River flood breached in Junxian and Neihuang counties in Henan Province, it successively breached five dikes in Qingfeng and Nanle counties and went straight to the Liaocheng area of Shandong Province. On August 14, the flood reached Shenxian County and has now crossed Guanxian County and entered Liaocheng County. The water level of the Fengjia River has risen sharply, and the situation is critical. In order to overcome the threat of floods, the people of the counties along the river, starting from the 11th, organized more than 180,000 laborers, led by more than 1,600 cadres, and launched a full-scale rescue and dike protection effort along the dikes extending more than 400 li. After several days and nights of continuous repairs, the dikes in Shenxian, Yanggu, Fanxian, and Guanxian counties have now been raised by one meter and widened by four meters compared to the original.
