Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 17th. The tendency of some cadres and peasants in rural Hunan Province to not pay enough attention to late rice cultivation is currently being corrected. The CCP committees in various localities are, on the one hand, combining the pilot work of the complete socialist agricultural cooperativization to publicize various policies of agricultural cooperativization; on the other hand, they are calculating production increase accounts and educating farmers to carry out field inspections, strengthening late rice cultivation with intertillage, topdressing, pest control, and drought resistance. After publicity and education, 1.65 million mu of late rice in Xiangtan Prefecture have been intertilled and topdressed. Yuanjiang County specifically held an enlarged meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader of agricultural cooperatives, analyzed the current production situation, and further criticized slackening thoughts. After the meeting, many township agricultural cooperatives promptly strengthened field management of late rice, implemented a household-based contract responsibility system, and launched a labor competition for exceeding production increase targets. The Baisha and Xi'an agricultural cooperatives of Gonghe Township also organized sixteen expedition teams to reclaim lake wasteland on Baini Island, ten miles away, and rush-transplant 1,200 mu of late rice. They have now transplanted more than 400 mu. They plan to produce 240,000 jin of grain on this land.

This year, early rice in various parts of Hunan Province had a bumper harvest, and some cadres and farmers developed an optimistic and relaxed mood. Some of them believed that "late rice yield is unreliable," holding an attitude of "reap if there is any, discard if there isn't"; some had misunderstandings about the policies of advanced cooperatives, fearing that planting good late rice was "building the country for others to enjoy"; some in hilly and mountainous areas lost confidence in late rice cultivation due to prolonged drought. In addition, autumn crops in various places this year have expanded compared to last year, and paddy fields and dry land are competing for fertilizer. Some farmers are afraid that late rice is not as reliable as dry land crops, and are unwilling to send manure to late rice fields.

Although Hunan Province has had a bumper harvest of early rice, mid-season rice has suffered from drought and reduced yields. Therefore, effectively strengthening late rice field management and striving for a bumper harvest is the key to completing this year's grain production increase plan for the province. Yunnan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company and Supply and Marketing Cooperative Train Cadres, Add Institutions, and Strengthen Medicinal Material Purchase Work

This newspaper, Kunming dispatch. The Yunnan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Provincial Pharmaceutical Company have taken effective measures to strengthen the purchase of medicinal materials.

In the past, due to the unfamiliarity of the supply and marketing cooperative's cadres with the business, they had difficulty in identifying the specifications of medicinal materials, and sometimes lost money, so they were afraid to purchase medicinal materials. In response to this situation, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Provincial Pharmaceutical Company have adopted methods such as technical exchange meetings and short-term technical training classes to improve the cadres' ability to identify medicinal materials. For example, the technical exchange meeting held by the Provincial Pharmaceutical Company on June 20 was attended by 34 cooperative cadres from Qujing, Yuxi, and Chuxiong prefectures. The meeting resolved the issue of how to identify the specifications of medicinal materials such as Arisaema, Pinellia, and Coptis chinensis, and determined how to publicize and explain the methods of processing medicinal materials to farmers. From May 10 to June 7, Dali Prefecture held a short-term training class, attended by 56 county and cooperative cadres, who learned the purchase knowledge of 100 kinds of medicinal materials. At present, the Provincial Pharmaceutical Company has sent more than 30 cadres, divided into three groups, to assist in the establishment of medicinal material organizations in various places. In the third quarter of this year, more than 90 medicinal material organizations will be established throughout the province.

    保证完成全年粮食增产计划
    湖南纠正对晚稻栽培不够重视的偏向
    新华社长沙17日电　湖南省农村中有些干部和农民对晚稻栽培不够重视的偏向，目前正在得到纠正。全省各地的中共党委一面结合全社会主义农业合作化试点工作，宣传农业合作化的各项政策；一面算增产账，教育农民开展田间检查，对晚稻加强中耕、追肥、治虫、抗旱等工作。经过宣传教育以后，湘潭专区已经有一百六十五万亩晚稻经过中耕和追肥。沅江县专门召开农业社生产队长以上的干部扩大会议，分析当前生产情况，并且进一步批判了松劲思想。会后，许多乡的农业社都及时加强对晚稻的田间管理，实行分户包工负责制，开展超额增产的劳动竞赛。共和乡白沙、西安等四个农业社还组织十六个远征队，到十里外的白泥洲开垦湖荒洼地，抢插一千二百亩晚稻。现在他们已经插了四百多亩。他们计划在这片土地上生产二十四万斤粮食。
    今年湖南省各地早稻丰收，有些干部和农民产生了乐观松懈情绪。他们有的认为“晚稻产量不可靠”，抱着“有就收，没就丢”的态度；有的对高级合作化的政策有误解，怕种好晚稻是“打出江山别人坐”；有的在丘陵区和山区，因久旱不雨而对晚稻栽培失去信心。另外，今年各地秋季作物都比去年扩大，水田、旱地争肥，有些农民怕晚稻不如旱地作物靠得住，有粪也不愿往晚稻田里送。
    湖南省虽然早稻丰收，但是中稻受旱歉收。因此，切实加强晚稻田间管理，争取丰收，是完成今年全省粮食增产计划的关键。云南省药材公司和供销社训练干部增设机构加强药材收购工作
    本报昆明电　云南省供销社和省药材公司采取有效措施，加强药材收购工作。
    过去由于供销社的干部业务不熟，鉴别药材的规格有困难，有时赔了钱，所以害怕收购药材。针对这种情况，省供销社和省药材公司采取了技术交流会，短期技术训练班等方式，来提高干部的鉴别能力。如六月二十日省药材公司举办的技术交流会，有曲靖、玉溪、楚雄三专区的社干部三十四人参加。会上解决了如何鉴别南星、半夏、黄莲等药材的规格问题，并且确定了怎样向农民宣传讲解药材加工的方法问题。大理专区于五月十日至六月七日，开办了短期训练班，有县、社干部五十六人参加，学习了一百种药材的收购知识。目前省药材公司派出了三十多个干部，分为三组，分别到各地协助成立药材机构。今年第三季度内，全省将成立九十多个药材机构。
