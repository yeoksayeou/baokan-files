Xinhua News Agency, Jiangling, 19th: In Jiangtai Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, sixty-four families of martyrs, servicemen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers recently received autumn harvest distribution notices from the agricultural producers' cooperatives they participate in. Among them, the incomes of fifty-eight families increased by 30% to 50% compared to last year. The incomes of three families doubled compared to last year, and the remaining three families can maintain last year's income.

The reason why the families of martyrs, servicemen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in this township have been able to universally increase their incomes is, on the one hand, due to the enthusiastic care shown to them by township and cooperative leaders and the broad masses of cooperative members over the past year. At the same time, it is also the result of their own love for the cooperative as their home and their diligent labor. In addition to providing certain preferential work considerations based on the specific circumstances of the families of martyrs, servicemen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, each agricultural producers' cooperative also appropriately arranged jobs for them during each production season according to their labor ability and special skills. The family of Liu Bangzhi, a serviceman in the Taihui Cooperative, only has two elderly people. The cooperative assigned them light work such as feeding cattle and guarding crops, which increased their grain income by five hundred catties compared to last year. Li Youliang, a fifty-five-year-old serviceman in the Xinnong Cooperative, was contracted by the cooperative to cultivate more than three mu of land closer to his home, while his daughter-in-law participated in collective production within the cooperative. In addition to cultivating the contracted land well, Li Youliang often looked for other things to do in the cooperative. This year, his family can earn six thousand catties of grain, an increase of three thousand two hundred catties compared to last year when he was in the elementary cooperative.

The Hongguang, Taihui, and Tongqiao agricultural producers' cooperatives had three serviceman families whose incomes were originally calculated to be slightly lower than last year. After the Jiangtai Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this situation, it immediately visited their homes with the cadres of these agricultural cooperatives and convened a meeting of the cadres of these three cooperatives to study solutions. The main reason for the reduced income of these three serviceman families was their relatively weak labor force. The three agricultural cooperatives decided to allocate more light work to them during the autumn harvest and planting season and appropriately increase their preferential work considerations, so that their income would at least remain balanced with last year, reaching the living standards of ordinary cooperative members.

    烈属军属普遍增加收入
    新华社江陵19日电　湖北省江陵县将台乡六十四户烈属、军属和革命残废军人，最近接到了他们参加的农业生产合作社送来的秋收分配通知单，其中有五十八户的收入比去年增加了三成到五成，有三户的收入比去年增加一倍，另外三户可以保持去年的收入。
    这个乡的烈、军属和革命残废军人所以能够普遍增加收入，一方面由于乡、社领导干部和广大社员一年来对他们的热情关怀，同时也是他们自己爱社如家、勤苦劳动的结果。各农业生产合作社除了根据烈、军属和革命残废军人的具体情况分别给他们以一定的优抚工照顾外，还按照他们的劳动能力和特长，在每个生产季节适当地为他们安排了活路。太晖社军属刘邦直家里只两个老人，社里分配他们喂牛、看护庄稼等轻活做，使他们比去年增加了五百斤粮食收入。新农社五十五岁的军属李有亮，社里把较近的三亩多田包给他种，他的儿媳参加社内集体生产。李有亮除了种好包工田外，还经常到社里找其他事情做。今年，他家能收入六千斤粮食，比去年在初级社增加三千二百斤。
    红光、太晖、同桥三个农业生产合作社有三户军属，原先计算今年的收入比去年要略有减少。中共将台乡支部发现这个情况后，马上会同这些农业社的干部到他们家里来访问，又召集这三个社的干部开会研究解决办法。这三户军属减少收入的原因主要是劳力较弱，这三个农业社就决定在秋收秋种中多分一些轻活给他们做，又适当地对他们增加了优抚工的照顾，使他们的收入至少和去年保持平衡，达到一般社员的生活水平。
