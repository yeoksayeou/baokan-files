Xinhua News Agency, August 7th dispatch from Washington: The Egyptian Embassy in the United States issued a statement to the press on August 6th, saying that Egypt will use a large portion of the Suez Canal revenue to deepen and widen the waterway.

The statement said: "Since promoting and facilitating navigation through this canal is in Egypt's interest, it is determined to do so and maintain the canal's operation at maximum technical efficiency. This is not only to accommodate current traffic needs—which the canal can barely handle now—but also to cope with the ever-increasing and anticipated increase in traffic volume."

Xinhua News Agency, August 7th dispatch from Cairo: According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, in the ten days after the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the number of ships passing through the canal increased by thirty-four compared to the same period last year.

The radio broadcast said that from July 26th to August 5th, a total of 455 ships passed through the Suez Canal, while the number of ships passing through in the same period in 1955 was 421.

The radio broadcast also said that from August 1st to August 5th this year, a total of 169 ships passed through, including 54 British ships and 13 French ships, in addition to ships from many other countries.
