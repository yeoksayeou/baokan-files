    平壤工业战线不断传出捷报
    朝鲜政府决定从十一月起提高基本工资
    新华社平壤12日电　在“八一五”的前夕，平壤的工业战线上不断传来捷报。
    朝鲜橡胶工业方面最大的工厂平壤橡胶工厂到八月十日已经在价值上完成了三年生产指标的109％。
    在三年计划期间，这个工厂在中国人民的援助下安装了十多种的新式机器，其中包括最新式的大型压延机。
    据“劳动新闻”报道，朝鲜轻工业方面最大的平壤纺织联合工厂也在八月四日完成了三年生产指标。
    在苏联人民的经济和技术援助下，这个联合工厂新安装了二千一百多台自动织布机和六万纱锭，并且在今年年初投入了生产。现在这个工厂每天生产棉织品二十万公尺。
    平壤谷产工厂已经从战争的严重破坏下修复，并且在十一日开工。这个工厂每年将生产一万五千吨以上的淀粉、六千九百吨糖稀、一万五千吨葡萄糖和用玉蜀黍制造的其他十二种产品。
    在昨天举行的开工庆祝典礼上，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉给在工厂的恢复和建设工作中作出了显著成绩的七十八位模范工人颁发了各级勋章和奖章。
    新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁今天通过决定，把各机关、厂矿、企业、部队中的工人、职员和军人的基本工资从今年十一月一日起平均提高35％。
    内阁的决定说，由于劳动人民忘我地进行劳动，使很多国民经济部门提前完成了三年计划（1954—56年），并且不断地提高了劳动生产率；同时，以苏联、中国为首的各兄弟国家继续给予朝鲜极大的物质援助，也造成了提高工资的可能性。
