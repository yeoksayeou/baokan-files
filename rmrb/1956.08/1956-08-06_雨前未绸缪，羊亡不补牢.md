The Huaibei Saltworks experienced a total of nineteen work-related injuries of varying severity in the first quarter of this year, a decrease of twenty-one compared to the same period last year. However, due to the saltworks' leadership's failure to diligently implement the policy of safe production, accidents have been on the rise since March. In March, Li Zhiyou, a worker from the First Field's Tenth Work Area, had his arm severed by a windmill. At the time, the Huaibei Saltworks also organized an inspection team to conduct an investigation. However, no effective measures were taken afterward; some even believed that since an accident had already occurred and a lesson had been learned, there would be no problems in the future. Little did they know that without measures, accidents are still unavoidable, even with lessons learned. Sure enough, in May, Sun Wenke, a worker from the Third Field's Sixth Work Area, also had his arm severed by a windmill. This time, the Huaibei Saltworks once again formed an inspection team, identified the causes of the accident, appropriately handled those responsible, and even planned to conduct a major safety and hygiene inspection in May, seemingly very serious and responsible. Who knew that before long, everything would be calm again, and by the end of May, there was not even a shadow of an inspection. On June 7th, Gao Changqing, a worker from the Fourth Field's Fourteenth Work Area, had his arm severed by a windmill.

The same type of accident has repeated three times in a very short period. Despite organizing inspection teams each time and the saltworks' leadership paying lip service to grand principles, there has been no real action. If this continues, who knows how many more accidents will occur. When will the Huaibei Saltworks' leadership change this style of only talking without acting, only inspecting without improving?

    雨前未绸缪，羊亡不补牢
    淮北盐场今年第一季度共发生大小工伤事故十九件，比去年同一时期减少了二十一件；但是由于盐场的领导上没有认真执行安全生产的方针，从三月份以后，事故越来越多。三月份，第一场十工区工人李志友的膀子被风车绞断了。当时，淮北盐场也组织了检查组进行检查。但是，事后并没有采取什么有效措施；甚至还有人认为既然已经发生事故，有了教训，今后就没问题了。却不知有了教训，若没有措施，事故还是难免。果然，五月份，第三场六工区工人孙文科的膀子又被绞断了。这次，淮北盐场再次组成检查组，查明了发生事故的原因，并对事故的责任者作了适当的处理，还准备在五月份进行安全卫生大检查，好像非常认真负责。谁知过不多久，又平安无事了，直到五月底，连个检查的影子都没有。到六月七日，四场十四工区工人高长清又被绞断了膀子。
    同类事故，在很短的时间内竟重复了三次，尽管每一次都组织检查组，盐场的领导上也空喊一阵大道理，实际上并没有什么行动。如果再这样下去，不知还要发生多少次这样的事故。淮北盐场的领导上究竟什么时候才能改变这种只说不做，只检查不改进的作风呢？　一读者
