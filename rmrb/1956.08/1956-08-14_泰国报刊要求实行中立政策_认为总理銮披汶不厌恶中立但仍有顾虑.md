Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 12th: The Bangkok-based "Free Communications" newspaper published an editorial on August 6th, commenting on Thai Prime Minister Phibun's attitude towards implementing a neutral policy.

Phibun recently replied to a Thai newspaper that advocated the Thai government should implement neutrality, saying: "In the future, if the world situation is clearer than it is now, and at the same time we (Thailand) no longer need to rely on anyone, we can implement neutrality." He said, "Whether we implement neutrality or not is not important; independence is more important. The government does not want to violate the law. In fact, we cannot yet be neutral, because to be neutral, we must first abolish the anti-communist regulations. However, the promulgation of the anti-communist regulations is in accordance with the world situation and in accordance with the constitution."

The editorial pointed out that Phibun's opinions show that he personally does not dislike neutrality, but is only concerned about certain situations. The editorial emphasized, "There is nothing Prime Minister is more concerned about than being oppressed by friendly nations, this friendly nation wants the Thai Prime Minister to follow the path it prescribes. Who that friendly nation is, it is not necessary to specify here, it is already well known."

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 12th: The "Independence" weekly published an editorial on August 10th, advocating that Thailand should implement a neutral policy.

The editorial said: "What the vast majority of Thai people unanimously believe is needed is for the government to implement a neutral policy and change the policy of joining any side. Because the reason why Thailand is currently in a difficult situation is that Thailand is still subject to the oppression of Western powers." The editorial pointed out that Western countries hope to gain more benefits from Thailand.

The editorial believes that the purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization preparing to hold military exercises in Thai territorial waters recently, in addition to the imperialists preparing for war, is also to intimidate Thailand and its neighboring countries from implementing a neutral policy. Because what the imperialists fear most is that Thailand will implement a neutral policy.

    泰国报刊要求实行中立政策
    认为总理銮披汶不厌恶中立但仍有顾虑
    据新华社12日讯　曼谷消息：泰国“自由通讯报”八月六日发表社论，评论泰国总理銮披汶对实行中立政策的态度。
    銮披汶最近曾答复一家主张泰国政府应当实行中立的泰国报纸说：“在将来如果世界局势比目前更明朗，同时我们（泰国）不必再依赖任何人时，我们是可以实行中立的”。他说：“我们实行中立与否，并不重要，独立才更重要。政府不愿违反法律。事实上我们也还不能中立，因为我们要能中立，就必须先取消防共条例。但是防共条例的颁行是符合于世界局势和符合于宪法的。”
    社论指出，銮披汶的这些意见显示他个人并不厌恶中立，只是对某些情势还存有顾虑而已，社论强调说：“总理的顾虑，没有什么比受到友邦压迫更甚的，这个友邦要泰国总理按照它所规定的道路走。谁是那个友邦，不必在这里指明，它已是众所周知的了。”
    据新华社12日讯　曼谷消息：“独立”周刊八月十日发表社论，主张泰国应当实行中立政策。
    社论说：“泰国绝大多数人民所一致认为需要的，是让政府实行中立政策，改变加入任何方面的政策。因为泰国目前所以处在困难境地，就是由于泰国仍然受到西方国家势力的压迫”。社论指出，西方国家希望更多地从泰国获得利益。
    社论认为，东南亚条约组织准备最近在泰国领海举行军事演习的目的，除了是帝国主义者为了备战以外，还在于恫吓泰国及其邻近国家不要实行中立政策。因为帝国主义者最害怕的是泰国将实行中立政策。
