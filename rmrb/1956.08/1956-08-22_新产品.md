  Unbreakable Plexiglas
    Xinhua News Agency: Plexiglas, a synthetic organic polymer compound made directly from materials such as uranium cyanide and methanol, has recently been successfully researched and trial-produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Coral Chemical Factory.
    Plexiglas is lighter and more shatter-resistant than ordinary glass, has a higher light transmittance, can transmit ultraviolet rays, can withstand certain concentrations of acids, alkalis, and voltages, and does not change when it comes into contact with animal and vegetable oils. This type of glass has many uses in national defense and industry. Aircraft windows, lamp glass, and the surface glass of precision instruments all require Plexiglas. It can also be used in optical instruments, electrical insulation, leather coatings, and in the medical field for manufacturing dentures, false teeth, lung spheres, etc.
    New Tool Appears on the
    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway - Slope Trimmer
    Xinhua News Agency: A tractor with a steel wing has recently appeared on the construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway mechanical road construction team.
    As it moves forward, the giant iron wing powerfully brushes over the side of the roadbed, making the loose and uneven roadbed slope neat and solid. The iron wing on the tractor is called a slope trimmer. The slope trimmer can trim more than one kilometer of roadbed slope in eight hours, which is equivalent to the physical labor workload of one hundred workers in the same amount of time.

  不易打碎的有机玻璃
    据新华社讯　用氰化铀、甲醇等原料直接合成的有机玻璃，最近由上海公私合营珊瑚化工厂研究试制成功。
    有机玻璃为一种高分子有机合成化合物，比普通玻璃轻、不易击碎，具有更高度的透光率，能透过紫外光线，能耐一定浓度的酸、碱和电压，遇到动植物油也不起变化。这种玻璃在国防和工业上用途很大。飞机上的窗玻璃、灯玻璃、精密仪表的表面玻璃都要用有机玻璃，在光学仪表、电气绝缘、制革涂料以及在医疗方面制造牙托、假牙、肺球等都可以使用这种玻璃。
    兰新铁路上出现
    新工具——刷坡机
    据新华社讯　在兰新铁路机械筑路队的工地上，最近出现一台长着一只钢铁翅膀的拖拉机。
    当它向前行进的时候，巨大的铁翅有力地刷过路基的边上，把松而不整齐的路基边坡刷得整齐结实。拖拉机上的铁翅叫刷坡机，刷坡机每八小时可以刷路基边坡一公里多，等于一百个工人同样时间的体力劳动工作量。
