Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 19th: The collective and individual sideline production of the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Ganzhe Town, Minhou County, Fujian Province, has developed since the division of business scope. In the summer harvest distribution, more than 95% of the members increased their income. In the past three months, the average income of members engaged in household sideline production has reached more than 80 yuan per household.

The Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative adopts three different methods for managing sideline production: large-scale sideline industries with large investments, high labor costs, and strong technical requirements, such as silkworm breeding, stone quarrying, fruit tree production, and sugarcane processing, are uniformly managed by the cooperative; small-scale, scattered sideline industries suitable for decentralized management, such as chopping firewood, cutting cogon grass, making bamboo hats, and raising poultry and livestock, are all assigned to individual members for management; in order to make full use of the original pigsty equipment of the members, the pigs collectively raised by the cooperative are contracted to the members for raising, with the income from pig raising belonging to the cooperative, and the contracting members receive reasonable remuneration. In addition, according to the strength of the members' labor force and technical expertise, and according to the agricultural and sideline production seasons, the cooperative rationally arranges the time for members to participate in cooperative production labor and engage in family individual sideline production, and provides assistance to members in terms of raw materials, funds, and sales channels for engaging in sideline production. In this way, not only has the cooperative's plan to increase the output of early rice by 20% compared to last year been successfully completed, but also sideline production has been restored and developed.

    副业生产搞得好
    新华社福州19日电　福建省闽侯县甘蔗镇长江农业社集体的和社员个人的副业生产，在划分经营范围以后，都得到了发展。夏收分配中，95％以上的社员增加了收入。在最近三个月中，社员从事家庭副业生产的收入平均每户达八十多元。
    长江农业社经营副业生产采取三种不同的方式：养蚕、打石、果树生产、蔗糖加工等投资大、花工多、技术性较强的大宗副业，由社统一经营；砍柴火、割莽草、制斗笠和饲养家禽、家畜等小宗零星副业，适宜分散经营的全部划归社员个人经营；为充分利用社员原有的猪舍设备，社里集体饲养的猪分散包给社员饲养，养猪收入归社所有，包养的社员得到合理的报酬。此外，根据社员劳力强弱和技术特长，根据农、副业生产季节，全社合理地安排了社员参加社里生产劳动和从事家庭个人副业生产的时间，并且在原料、资金、销路等方面给予社员从事副业生产以帮助。这样，既保证了全社早稻产量比去年增产二成的计划顺利完成，又使副业生产得到恢复和发展。
