    Luzhou Longan Achieves a Bumper Harvest
    (Our report) The nationally renowned Luzhou longan is now on the market. This past winter and spring, fruit farmers pruned and fertilized the longan trees. Coupled with favorable and even rainfall this year, the longan crop has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics, the output is estimated to be more than 4 million jin, an increase of 12% compared to 1954. Currently, the local supply and marketing cooperatives are actively engaged in the purchase of longan. (Zhou Shunan)
