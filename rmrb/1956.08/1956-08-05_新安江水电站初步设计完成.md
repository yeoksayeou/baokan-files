    Xin'an River Hydropower Station Preliminary Design Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 3rd: The preliminary design of the large-scale Zhejiang Xin'an River Hydropower Station was completed in Shanghai at the end of July.
    This hydropower station was designed by Chinese designers under the guidance of Soviet experts. Starting in January of last year, the Hydropower Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, which was responsible for the design of the hydropower station, mobilized more than 300 engineering and technical personnel, spent more than 16,600 workdays, compared dozens of technical and economic plans, and finally came up with the design.
    Before and during the preliminary design, the design institute collected seven years of hydrological, rainfall, and meteorological data from the Xin'an River basin; twenty-six years of meteorological data from the Qiantang River basin; and sixty-eight years of meteorological data from Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places for research. The Ministry of Geology also organized a geological team of nearly 100 people, and a drilling team of more than 500 people to cooperate with it, and conducted a comprehensive survey of the Xin'an River basin. The data obtained from hydrology, meteorology, and surveys prove that the Xin'an River basin has good strata for building a large reservoir, and there is also sufficient rainfall to fill the reservoir to supply power generation for the hydropower station.

    新安江水电站初步设计完成
    新华社上海3日电　规模巨大的浙江新安江水电站的初步设计，七月底在上海完成。
    这个水电站是在苏联专家指导下，由中国设计人员设计的。从去年一月开始，担负水电站设计工作的电力工业部水电设计院，共动员了三百多个工程技术人员，花费了一万六千六百多个劳动日，比较了几十个技术经济方案，最后设计出来的。
    在进行初步设计前后，这个设计院曾经收集了新安江流域地区七年来的水文、雨量、气象资料；钱塘江流域二十六年来的气象资料和上海、南京等地六十八年来的气象资料进行研究。地质部也组织了一支近百人的地质队，并且由一支五百多人的钻探队相配合，在新安江流域进行了全面性的勘测。从水文、气象以及勘测得到的资料证明，新安江流域内有着建筑大水库的良好地层，并且也有足够储满这个水库来供水电站发电的雨量。
