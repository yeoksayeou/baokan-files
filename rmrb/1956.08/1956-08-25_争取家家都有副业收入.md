    Help Members Develop Household Sideline Production
    Editor's Note: Currently, many agricultural production cooperatives have overcome the one-sidedness of developing production and have begun to pay attention to operating sideline production. However, when developing sideline production, some cooperatives only see collective sideline production and ignore the household sideline production of members. There are many categories of rural sideline production, and the cooperative's collective production cannot cover all kinds of sideline production. Only paying attention to collective sideline production will inevitably lead to the neglect of many small-profit, high-yield sporadic sidelines, which is very detrimental to the overall economic development of rural areas. On the other hand, farmers have always had the habit of engaging in household sideline production, which is the main source of farmers' daily sporadic expenses. Some members cannot engage in household sideline production, and the cooperative has not established a reasonable advance payment system, so they don't even have money to buy oil and salt. This phenomenon is very abnormal. In order to comprehensively develop rural production and ensure that members increase their income more, agricultural cooperatives should pay attention to guiding members to restore and develop household sideline production while developing collective sideline production. The two news reports published here are good examples of leading members in household sideline production.
    Strive to Ensure Every Household Has Sideline Income

    Anyone who has been to the Shentang Dengta Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, will say that the cooperative's household sideline production is doing well. Look, in the courtyard of every farmer's house, there are pigs or sheep; even more chickens, with three or four in each household. On Sundays, members go to the mountains to cut twigs and chop wood; some go out to sell lime and do handicrafts; and others are working on their private plots. In this cooperative, every household has at least one kind of household sideline production. The cooperative has a total of 516 households, and from January to May this year, the household sideline income totaled 4,898.50 yuan, with an average income of 9.49 yuan per household. In addition to the cooperative's collective sideline net profit of more than 18,800 yuan, of which more than 6,000 yuan was advanced to the members in three installments, each member household had a total cash income of more than 20 yuan. Liang Yuanjin, the deputy director in charge of sideline production, said, "The problem of not having pocket money does not exist in our cooperative."
    The household sideline production of Dengta Cooperative was developed after it was converted to an advanced cooperative in January this year. Originally, the four natural villages to which this cooperative belonged were all near the mountains and had broad avenues for sideline production, such as cutting twigs, chopping wood, collecting firewood, digging medicinal herbs, weaving baskets, burning lime, and quarrying stone slabs, totaling dozens of kinds. Farmers have always had the habit of engaging in sideline production. However, since the establishment of the cooperative in 1953, the cooperative cadres believed that "members engaging in household sideline production would affect agriculture." Therefore, the cooperative only operated lime kilns and twig cutting, and most of the scattered sidelines suitable for individual members to operate were suspended. The members had no choice but to "guard the green mountains without firewood to burn."
    In January this year, more and more members were complaining about not having pocket money. At this time, the Wenshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to develop sideline production. After studying, the Party branch and the management committee of the cooperative realized the importance of engaging in sideline production, made a comprehensive sideline production plan, and determined that the deputy director and the sideline production section would be responsible for guiding the members' household sideline production. In this way, the members' household sideline production quickly recovered and developed.
    Engaging in household sideline production requires some time. The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative adopted the method of "spending Sundays" to allow members one day of personal activity every seven days. The cooperative stipulates that if a production team completes its original planned agricultural work ahead of schedule, it can "spend Sunday" one day earlier. If the production plan is not completed by Sunday, then according to the needs of the agricultural work, either the "Sunday" is postponed, or the cooperative committee uniformly adjusts the agricultural work on Friday and Saturday to solve the problem of members "spending Sunday." With the Sunday system, all production teams in the cooperative take one week as a section for arranging agricultural work. Under normal circumstances, they can "spend Sunday" on time. During the busy farming season, there is generally no "Sunday." During the sowing season, such as during the spring plowing period, there were more than 20 days without a holiday, and it was made up after the sowing was completed. The sideline production section of Dengta Agricultural Cooperative has a technical guidance group, composed of some old farmers with technical skills and experience. They use various forms to teach various techniques and adopt the method of "master teaching apprentice" to learn. Members of Kangjiabao Village can cut twigs but cannot weave, while Hexi Village is very famous for weaving, but twig cutting is not as good as Kangjiabao. Therefore, the cooperative helped the two villages jointly establish a technical learning group and hired Hou Huchang, a skilled twig cutter and weaver, as the leader of the group. After more than three months of study, 20 people who could not cut twigs have now learned to cut twigs, and 12 members who could not weave have also learned general weaving techniques.
    After the development of the members' household sideline production, the sales route is an important issue. Except for eggs and pigs, which are purchased uniformly by the supply and marketing cooperative, most of the household sideline products of Dengta Cooperative are promoted by the agricultural cooperative. For example, the agricultural cooperative has signed contracts with the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the county for various woven products, signed contracts with the handicraft cooperative for the supply of twigs and wood, and signed contracts with several nearby supply and marketing cooperatives for the promotion of lime. Then, the agricultural cooperative arranges the time for them to transport the products in an organized and planned manner according to the sideline production of each member household in the cooperative. For sideline products such as stones, which are difficult for members to transport, the agricultural cooperative purchases them for the cooperative or allocates vehicles and horses to the members appropriately. Sometimes the agricultural cooperative also signs contracts with the outside world first and then organizes the members to produce. For more than half a year, the sideline products produced by the members have not encountered a situation where they cannot find a sales route.
    The most important point that Dengta Cooperative pays attention to in leading members to develop household sideline production is to give play to the inherent strengths of each family according to the specific circumstances of the members, and to give special care to members in difficulty, striving to ensure that every household has sideline income. In addition to calling on 37 craftsmen such as carpenters, blacksmiths, stonemasons, plasterers, paper hangers, kiln installers, well diggers, tailors, weavers, barbers, and shoemakers to use their skills to develop household production, the management committee also stipulates that if the time they spend on these productions exceeds the personal activity time stipulated by the cooperative, they are also allowed to continue their personal productions under the condition that it does not affect agricultural production, as long as they give the cooperative a portion of the money they earn to offset labor days. In this way, the agricultural cooperative not only avoids the overall interests being affected by some members engaging in too much personal sideline business, but also takes care of the personal interests of the members. For the 72 particularly difficult member households, Dengta Cooperative adopts two methods to help them engage in sideline business. One is that the agricultural cooperative buys pigs and provides feed, and they raise them to earn labor days. For example, it is stipulated that each pig weighing 80 jin will be recorded as 12 labor days, a pig weighing 100 jin will be recorded as 15 labor days, a pig weighing 120 jin will be recorded as 18 labor days, and the excess part exceeding 120 jin will be converted into personal income at a discount. The other is to extract a part of the agricultural cooperative's lime and sell it to them on credit, allowing them to transport it out and sell it themselves.

    帮助社员发展家庭副业生产
    编者按　目前，许多农业生产合作社都克服了发展生产的片面性，开始注意经营副业生产了。但在发展副业生产的时候，有些社还只看到集体副业生产，忽视了社员的家庭副业生产。农村副业生产的门类是很多的，社的集体生产包揽不了各种副业生产。只注意集体副业生产，势必有许多本小利大的零星副业被忽视，这对整个农村的经济发展是很不利的。另一方面，农民历来就有经营家庭副业的习惯，家庭副业生产是农民日常零星花销的主要来源。有些社员因为不能经营家庭副业生产，加上合作社没有建立起合理的预支制度，连买油盐的钱都没有了。这种现象是很不正常的。为了全面地发展农村生产，保证社员更多地增加收入，农业合作社在发展集体副业生产的同时，要注意领导社员把家庭副业生产恢复和发展起来。这里发表的两篇通讯，是领导社员进行家庭副业生产的好例子。
    争取家家都有副业收入
    史可鉴
    到过山西文水县神堂灯塔农业生产合作社的人，都会说这个社的家庭副业生产搞得不错。看吧，每户农家的庭院里面，不养有猪，便喂有羊；鸡更多，每家都有三、四只。到了星期日，社员们有的上山割条子、砍木把；有的外出卖石灰、做手艺工；还有的在作务自用地。这个社里，每家至少都有一种家庭副业生产。全社共有五百一十六户，今年一到五月五个月时间，家庭副业收入共四千八百九十八元五角，平均每户收入九元四角九分。加上社的集体副业净赚的一万八千八百多元，其中有六千多元分三次预支给社员，每户社员一共有二十多元的现金收入。领导副业的副主任梁元金说：“没有零花钱的问题，在我们社里是不存在的。”
    灯塔社的社员家庭副业是今年一月转高级社以后才发展起来的。本来，这个社所属的四个自然村都靠山，有着广阔的副业生产门路，如割条子、砍木把、砍柴、刨药材、编筐子、烧石灰、起石板等几十种。农民们从来就有进行副业生产的习惯。但是，自从1953年建社以后，社干部们认为“社员搞家庭副业要影响农业”，于是，合作社只经营石灰窑和割条子两种副业，多数宜于社员个人经营的零碎副业就停顿下来了。社员们只好“守着青山没柴烧”。
    今年一月份，叫喊没有零花钱的社员越来越多了，正在这时候，中共文水县委发出开展副业生产的指示。党的分支部和社的管理委员会经过学习，认识到进行副业生产的重要性，作出了全面的副业生产规划，并确定副主任和副业股负责领导社员的家庭副业生产。这样，社员的家庭副业很快地恢复和发展起来了。
    进行家庭副业生产是需要一些时间的。灯塔农业社采用“过星期日”的办法，让社员每七天就有一天个人活动的时间。社里规定：如果那个生产队提前作完原计划的农活，可以早一天“过星期日”。如果到星期日完不成生产计划，就根据农活的需要，或者推迟“过星期日”，或者由社委会在星期五、六统一调剂农活，解决社员“过星期日”的问题。有了星期日的制度，全社各生产队都以一星期为安排农活的一个段落。在通常情况下，都能按时“过星期日”。在农忙季节，一般都不“过星期日”。下种时如在春耕期，有二十多天没有放过假，播种结束后才补起来。灯塔农业社的副业股设有技术指导小组，由一些有技术有经验的老农组成。他们利用各种形式传授各种技术，采用“师傅带徒弟”的办法进行学习。康家堡村的社员会割条子，但不会编织，而河西村在编织上很有名，可是割条子却不如康家堡。于是社里帮助这两个村共同成立了技术学习组，聘请能割会编的把式侯虎昌当组长。经过三个多月的学习，现在有二十个不会割条子的人学会了割条子，有十二个原来不会编织的社员也学会了一般的编织技术。
    社员的家庭副业发展起来以后，销路是一个重要的问题。灯塔社的家庭副业产品除鸡蛋和猪由供销合作社统一收购以外，绝大部分产品都是由农业社帮助推销的。比如，农业社和本县城关供销社订了各种编织品的合同，和手工业社订了供应条子、木把合同，又和附近几个供销社订立了推销石灰合同。然后，农业社根据全社各户社员的副业生产情况，有组织有计划地安排他们运送产品的时间。像石头这类副业产品，社员不好运送，农业社就收买归社或适当拨给社员车马。有时候农业社也先到外面订下合同，再组织社员生产。半年多以来，社员们所生产出的副业产品，还没有发生过找不到销路的情形。
    灯塔社领导社员发展家庭副业最注意的一点，是根据社员的具体情况，发挥每个家庭固有的特长，并且特别照顾有困难的社员，争取作到家家都有副业收入。管理委员会除号召木匠、铁匠、石匠、泥匠、表糊、装窑、打井、缝纫、编织、理发、钉鞋等三十七个手艺工匠，应用他们的技术发展家庭生产以外，并规定如果他们进行这些生产所用的时间需要超过了社里规定的个人活动时间，也允许他们在不影响农业生产的条件下继续进行个人的这些生产，只要他们交给社里一部分赚下的钱顶劳动日就可以了。这样，农业社既避免了部分社员因过多的搞个人副业而影响整体利益，又照顾了社员的个人利益。对于七十二户特别困难的社员，灯塔社采用两种办法帮助他们搞副业。一种是农业社买猪、供饲料，由他们喂养赚劳动日。比如规定每只猪喂到八十斤重记十二个劳动日，喂到一百斤重记十五个劳动日，喂到一百二十斤重记十八个劳动日，超过一百二十斤重，超过部分折价归个人所得。一种是抽出农业社的一部分石灰，赊销给他们，让他们自己运出去卖。
