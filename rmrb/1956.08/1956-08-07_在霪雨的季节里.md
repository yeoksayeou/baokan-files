In the Season of Continuous Rain

For several days, Beijing has suffered from rainstorms unprecedented in the past decade. The disaster situation in low-lying areas near rivers is quite severe. However, under the call of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the people of the capital have been urgently mobilized. Cadres took the lead in rescuing injured residents and state property. The masses treated the affected residents like their own brothers. The Chinese People's Liberation Army dispatched planes and rubber boats, and PLA officers led soldiers to rescue farmers trapped by the floodwaters. Now, most residents have been properly resettled, ensuring the safety of their lives and property. This time, the people of the capital united as one, waging a heroic struggle against the rain. The following facts are just a few of the countless examples!

Zhao Kuihai Moves in the Rain

It was past 11 o'clock at night, and vegetable farmer Zhao Kuihai still dared not go to sleep. The rain was falling incessantly, and the roof was leaking everywhere. Every now and then, a piece of mud would fall. Every time a piece of mud fell, his heart would jump: what if the house collapses in the middle of the night? He leaned on his cane and took a few steps, slipping and almost falling – the ground was a muddy mess.

He sighed. The terrain of this house is really bad. The south side is a high slope, and when it rains, the water flows to the door. These days of continuous rain have turned the area around the house into a small lake. It seems that this house cannot be saved.

Just then, he suddenly heard someone moving in the yard. Who is it, not afraid of being flooded and running over? He was wondering when three people came in. It turned out to be cadres from the Chongwen District People's Committee and the Yuqingguan Street Office. What are they here for? Just as he was about to ask, a cadre from the district spoke: "Your house is too dangerous. We have already spoken to Zhao Guilin, who sells vegetables. You can go to his house to take shelter."

What, go to Old Zhao's house to take shelter? It's not that Zhao Kuihai doesn't know Old Zhao, but his house isn't that spacious either. Why cause him trouble?

"Old Zhao is willing to help! In times of difficulty, everyone helps each other!..." The cadre finally persuaded him. But how to get there? Zhao Kuihai started to worry again. These two useless legs, he usually has to use crutches to walk, and now the rain outside is so heavy, and the water is so deep, I'm afraid he won't be able to move a step!

"It's okay, we'll help you walk!" The few people hurriedly went out the door.

Before they had walked a few steps, Zhao Kuihai stopped. The water was more than knee-deep, not to mention, the worst thing was that the ground was uneven, and he kept falling.

"I'm not going anymore!" Zhao Kuihai stopped and said.

"I'll carry you!" said a thin young man of twenty years old. His name is Liu Rushan, and he is a cadre in the Commercial Section of the Chongwen District People's Committee.

"You? How can that work! I'm a fat man, more than 180 pounds, and you're so thin!" Zhao Kuihai shook his head, looking at Liu Rushan.

"I'm not kidding. I can carry you over." Without allowing Zhao Kuihai to object, Liu Rushan carried him on his back and left.

In this way, in the dark night, Zhao Kuihai safely arrived at the home of his friend Old Zhao.

Fresh Vegetables Even on Rainy Days

Early in the morning, housewives were carrying baskets to the market to buy vegetables. Here, everyone is satisfied to be able to buy fresh vegetables on continuous rainy days, and sincerely thanks the enthusiastic support of the farmers in the suburbs.

Just as it was getting light, members of the Luying Production Cooperative in the Nanyuan District braved the heavy rain, slipping and sliding as they went to the fields to pick tomatoes, eggplants, green peppers... The mud on the village road was more than a foot deep, making it difficult to stand. Not only was it difficult for people to walk, but even carts could not pass. The young and strong male members automatically organized themselves to transport vegetables, carrying them on their backs and lifting them, carrying hundreds of pounds of vegetables from the fields to the carts on the road two miles away. Sweat and rain soaked their clothes, but they happily carried the vegetables out again and again. Under such difficult conditions, this cooperative transports ten to twenty thousand pounds of fresh vegetables to supply the people of the city every day.

Heroic Deeds of Cart Workers

On the night of July 29, the torrential rain continued to fall. The rainwater on Chaoyangmen Street flowed directly eastward, immediately filling the streets around Dongchenggen. The water was visibly rising foot by foot, flooding the streets and pouring into the courtyards and houses of the residents. The doors of the houses were being washed open, and people were frightened. Cart workers Yang Deheng, Liu Yongmao, and others who lived near Chaoyangmen immediately harnessed their rubber-wheeled carts, rushed to Dongchenggen, and carried residents, old and young, on their backs and lifted them into the carts, making more than a dozen trips back and forth, transporting more than two hundred people to safety. Liu Yongmao ran into the courtyard of No. 144 Dongchenggen and saw two postpartum women who had not been a month old lying in bed, their faces as white as paper with fright. He carried them on his back and took them to a safe place, and the two babies were also saved. (Lin)

Not Frightened

As the rain continued to pour down, Liang Shuqin, a member of the Western Residents Committee of Beiyingfang in the Xidan District, anxiously ran to the homes of four workers, including Chen Jinlong, to urge them to move to her house temporarily, so as to avoid being crushed by the collapse of their houses in the middle of the night.

Since the heavy rain, Liang Shuqin has made four or five mobilization efforts to Chen Jinlong and the other four households. Every time she mobilized them to move, they always said that Liang Shuqin's family of four (her two children did not live at home) only lived in two small rooms, and they were afraid of disturbing her. That night, when they saw Liang Shuqin and other residents committee members coming to mobilize them again, they were very moved and had to accept their persuasion.

At this time, Liang Shuqin and her husband were extremely happy, and braved the heavy rain to help them move their belongings back and forth, carrying the children, and did not finish until after ten o'clock at night, when everyone was settled (two households were settled in another resident's home). By this time, her clothes were already soaked, but she was still busy pouring boiled water from the stove for everyone to drink, and getting hot water for everyone to wash their faces and feet. Everyone also felt as if they were at home, and slept peacefully.

The next day, the roof of Chen Jinlong's original house collapsed. Because they had moved, not only were people not frightened, but their belongings were not damaged either. (Chen Yichao)

Residents of Taiyanggong Primary School

The rain was getting heavier and heavier. The rainwater was simply pouring down from the sky like large buckets.

The residents living in the classrooms of Taiyanggong Primary School, looking at the rain outside the window, no longer felt as nervous as before. Li Shufang cooked a pot of fragrant white rice, and the family was leisurely eating. Several mothers who were feeding their children lay asleep on beds made of tables. A large group of children were gathered together playing on the floor of the classroom. Worker Wang Desheng thoughtfully said: "The cadres from the district came to inspect the house on the 3rd and said that our house was about to collapse and we had to move out quickly. We were skeptical. Who knew that the house really collapsed as soon as we moved out. Fortunately, the government took such good care of us, otherwise, I don't know what would have happened to my family!" Yin Fufa's wife held the cadre's hand and said gratefully: "You have been working so hard these past few days! In the heavy rain, you helped us find a place to live, and even personally swept the floor and made our beds, and even solved the problem of drinking tap water early on."

Isn't that right? Cadres from the Yuqingguan Street Office in Chongwen District, police officers from the police station, and street activists have not rested since the 2nd. They checked all the houses in the Yuqingguan area. The houses in this area are too old, and some houses are even lower than the street. When it rains, the courtyard is filled with water. The houses are dangerous, and the residents must be mobilized to move immediately. But many people are used to living in their own homes, and it is convenient to use pots and pans, and they refuse to move no matter what. The cadres exhausted their words before finally persuading them. They were willing, but moving was also a big problem. The water was as deep as a small river, the old ladies couldn't walk, and the old men had to be supported. In this way, the cadres were busy from the 2nd to the 5th, and some didn't even have time to eat. The wind was very strong, and sometimes it was useless to hold an umbrella. Their raincoats were soaked. Xiao Yonglu, the director of the Dongsikuaiyu Residents Committee, ran around in the water all day wearing only a pair of shorts, and his whole body was frozen purple. When he got home, he covered himself with a thick quilt and still shivered from the cold. Xu Jinshi, the deputy director of the Nanquekou Residents Committee, was already over sixty years old, and ran back and forth wearing a straw raincoat to take care of people. She was busy all day on the 3rd and didn't sleep at night. She continued to work on the 4th. Others persuaded her to take a rest, but she refused, saying: "Now is not the time to rest! We must ensure that no one is crushed to death and no one starves to death!"

In this way, more than 100 households in Yuqingguan moved out of dangerous houses in the heavy rain and moved into schools and neighbors' homes. (Zimian) (Attached photo)

### 在霪雨的季节里

专栏：在首都

    在霪雨的季节里
    数日以来，北京市遭受了十几年来从未有过的大雨。地势低洼靠河地区，灾情相当严重。但是，首都人民在市人民委员会的号召下，紧急动员起来了。干部带头抢救受伤居民和国家物资。群众把受灾居民当作自己亲兄弟一样接待。中国人民解放军出动了飞机、橡皮船，解放军军官带领着兵士，抢救被水围困的农民。现在，大部分居民已得到了妥善的安置，保证了他们的生命财产的安全。这次，首都人民团结得像一个人似的，同雨水展开了英勇的斗争。像下面所看到的一些事实，又何止万千呢！
    赵奎海雨中搬家
    深夜十一点多了，菜农赵奎海还不敢去睡觉。雨，没完没了地下着，房顶都漏湿了。隔一会，就掉一块泥。掉一块泥，他的心就跳一下：深更半夜，房子塌下来怎么办？他扶着手杖下地走了几步，一走一滑，差点摔倒——地成了泥糊糊。
    他叹起气来。这房子的地势可真不好，南边是个高坡，一下雨，水就往门口流。这几天连着落雨，房子四周简直变成了小湖。看样子，这房子是保不住了。
    正在这时候，他忽然听到院里有人走动。什么人，不怕水淹跑来了？他正纳闷，进来了三个人。原来是崇文区人民委员会和玉清观街道办事处的干部。他们来作什么？他正想问，区里的干部开口了：“你这房子太危险，我们已经给卖菜的赵桂林说好，你去他家躲一躲。”
    怎么，去老赵家躲一躲？赵奎海不是不认识老赵，人家家里也不是那么宽敞，干什么给人家添麻烦？
    “人家老赵愿意帮忙！困难时候，大家互相帮忙哪！……”干部总算把他说通了。可是怎么走呢？赵奎海又发起愁来。这两条不中用的腿，平时走路还得用拐杖，现在外面的雨那么大，水那么深，恐怕一步都动不得呵！
    “不要紧，我们扶着你走！”几个人就这样急急忙忙出了门。
    没走了几步，赵奎海就停住了。水深到膝盖以上不用说，最糟的是地上高低不平，直要摔跤。
    “说什么我也不走了！”赵奎海停下来说。
    “我来背你！”一个二十岁的瘦瘦的小伙子说。他叫刘汝善，是崇文区人民委员会商业科的一个干部。
    “你？那怎么行！我是个胖子，有一百八十多斤，而你这么瘦！”赵奎海望着刘汝善摇摇头。
    “我不是说着玩的。我能背你过去。”刘汝善不容赵奎海反驳，背上他就走了。
    就这样，在漆黑的夜里，赵奎海平安地到了朋友老赵的家里。

    雨天也吃到新鲜蔬菜
    一清早，家庭主妇们都提着篮子上市场买菜去了。在这里，大家都为能在连阴雨天买到新鲜蔬菜而满意，并且从内心感谢郊区农民兄弟的热情支援。
    天刚刚亮，南苑区的吕营生产合作社的社员，就冒着大雨一走一滑地下地去摘西红柿、茄子、青椒……。村路上的泥泞一尺多深，滑得站不稳脚。不仅人不好走，连马车也不能通行。年青力壮的男社员们就自动组织起来运送蔬菜，背的背、抬的抬，把成百斤的蔬菜从地里背到二里以外的公路上的马车上。汗和雨水把他们的衣服全浸湿了，但是他们却高高兴兴地一趟又一趟地把蔬菜运出来。在这样困难条件下，这个社每天都运出一两万斤新鲜蔬菜供应市区人民。

    大车工人的英勇行为
    七月二十九日夜里，瓢泼似的大雨下个不停。朝阳门大街上的雨水直向东流去，立刻灌满了东城根一带的街道，眼看着水一尺一尺的涨上来，淹没了街道，往住户的院子屋子里倒灌起来。一家家住户的房门被冲开了，人们都害怕起来。住在朝阳门附近的大车工人杨德恒、刘永茂等人，立刻套上自己的胶轮大车，赶到东城根去，背的背，抬的抬，把各住户的老老少少放在大车上，来回拉了十几次，把二百多口人送到安全的地带。刘永茂跑到东城根一百四十四号的院子里，看到两个没出满月的产妇躺在床上，面色吓的像白纸，他把她俩背起来，送到安全的地方，两个小宝宝也得救了。　（林）
    没有受到惊吓
    雨正在哗哗啦啦地下着，西单区北营房西部居民委员会的委员梁淑琴，焦急地又跑到陈金龙等四户工人家里去，动员他们搬到她家去暂住，以免深夜房屋倒塌砸着人。
    下大雨以来，梁淑琴向陈金龙等四户已经作了四、五次动员工作了。每次动员他们搬家，他们总是说梁淑琴家四口人（她的两个孩子没在家住）也只住了两间小房，怕打搅她。这天夜里，他们见梁淑琴和别的居民委员又来动员，他们非常感动，只好接受了他们的劝说。
    这时梁淑琴和他丈夫高兴得了不得，冒着大雨帮助他们来回搬东西、抱小孩，一直忙到夜里十多点钟才把大家安顿好（有两户安顿在另一户居民家）。这时她身上的衣服早已湿透了，但是她还忙着把炉子上的开水倒给大家喝，又弄热水给大家洗脸、洗脚。大家也好像是在自己家一样，安安稳稳地睡觉了。
    第二天，陈金龙他们原来住的房顶就倒塌下来，因为搬了家不但人没有受到惊吓，东西也没有受到损失。　（陈一超）
    太阳宫小学的住户
    雨越下越大了。雨水简直像一大桶一大桶从天上倒下来的。
    住在太阳宫小学教室里的居民，望着窗外的雨，心里却不像先前那样紧张了。李淑芳煮了一锅香喷喷的白米饭，一家人正悠闲地吃着。几个喂孩子吃奶的妈妈，躺在用桌子搭成的床铺上睡熟了。教室的地上有一大群孩子正聚在一起玩。工人王德生若有所思地说：“三日那天区里的干部来看房说，我们的房子要塌，得赶快搬出去，我们将信将疑。哪知道，一搬出来房子果真塌了。幸亏政府照顾得这样周到，不然，一家大小现在还不知怎样了！”殷复发的女人拉着干部的手感激地说：“你们这几天可真辛苦啦！大雨天，帮我们找住处，还亲自给我们扫地、搭铺，连吃自来水的问题都早给想法解决了。”
    可不是吗？崇文区玉清观街道办事处干部、派出所的民警和街道积极分子从二日起就没歇过。他们把玉清观那一片的房子统统检查了一遍。这一带房子是太老了，有些房子比街道还低，一下雨，院里就积满了水。房子危险，得马上动员住户搬家。可是好多人在自己家住惯了，盆盆罐罐用起来方便，说什么也不肯搬。干部们费尽了口舌最后才说服。愿意是愿意了，可搬起来也是个大问题，水深得像小河一样，老太太走不动，老头子得有人扶，就这样，干部们从二日一直忙到五日，有的连饭都顾不上吃。风很大，有时打伞都不顶事，他们穿的雨衣都湿透了。东四块玉居民委员会的主任萧永禄只穿着个短裤，在水里跑了一天，浑身上下都冻紫了，到家盖上厚棉被还冷得直打颤。南缺口居民委员会的副主任徐金氏已经六十多岁了，披着蓑衣跑来跑去照顾人。三日她忙了整整一天，晚上都没睡觉，四号又接着干，别人劝她歇歇，她不肯，说：“现在哪有闲功夫歇！我们要作到不压死一个人，不饿死一个人！”
    玉清观一百多户人家就这样在大雨中都搬出了危险房屋，住进学校和邻居家里。　（自勉）（附图片）
    工商业者家属刘淑香的住房在连日阴雨中倒塌了。现在她领着两个孩子舒适地住在一个小学校里。    本报记者  纳一摄
