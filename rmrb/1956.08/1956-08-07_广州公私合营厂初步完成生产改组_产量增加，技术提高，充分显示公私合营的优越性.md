Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 4th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Li): Industrial enterprises in Guangzhou that implemented public-private partnerships at the beginning of this year have further unleashed their production potential after initial production reorganization. Most of them are able to undertake larger production tasks entrusted by the state than in the past. The total output value of the newly jointly operated factories in the chemical industry that have completed the reorganization will increase by nearly half in the third quarter of this year compared to the second quarter. After the potential of the factories in the textile industry is unleashed, the output of cotton cloth, undershirts and trousers, and towels in the third quarter of this year will exceed the highest level in the same period in history.

As the production reorganization progresses, many enterprises have begun to change their original scattered and backward state, balance their technical equipment, and concentrate their technical forces, resulting in improved technical levels. The machinery industry, which used to focus only on repairing or manufacturing some parts, is now able to independently produce some important products after reorganization. For example, the Gonghexiang Machinery Factory, which could only manufacture steam engines below 180 horsepower, has been able to trial-produce 380 horsepower steam engines and locomobile boilers after merging with thirteen small factories in this reorganization. The Tongsheng Machinery Factory, which was not large in scale, has merged with six factories during the reorganization and has now become a heavy machinery manufacturing factory capable of manufacturing mining machinery, drilling machinery, and sugar industry machinery. Thirty-one factories that have only been able to produce bicycle parts in the past have recently successfully trial-produced complete bicycles after merging and reorganizing. The chemical industry, after reorganization, has successfully trial-produced and started producing more than ten new products or varieties, such as 666 insecticide powder and titanium dioxide.

Guangzhou began planning the production reorganization of new public-private joint industrial enterprises in February this year. In the process of formulating the reorganization plan, the relevant departments conducted thorough investigations on the characteristics of various industries, product types, equipment capacity, technical strength, capital and sales situation, inter-factory dependencies and cooperation, factory size, and employee accommodation and transportation conditions. After the initial reorganization plan was formulated, employees and capitalist personnel were mobilized to study and discuss it. The reorganization plans for various industries generally went through three or four revisions before being finalized after being reviewed and approved by the city's competent departments. Because of this prudence, unrealistic ideas and practices that appeared in the early stages of formulating the reorganization plan among some cadres, such as merging large factories and requesting large-scale investment in expansion, were promptly criticized and corrected. The finally determined plan generally achieved the goal of minimizing factory changes, minimizing expansion and investment, based on the principle of being conducive to production. The form of reorganization also took into account the characteristics of various industries and even factories. For example, the machinery industry was originally small and scattered, with high工艺性 (technical artistry), and the production task was very large. If factories were not properly merged and production concentrated, it would be difficult to improve the output and quality of products. Therefore, in the reorganization, a larger reduction and merger was carried out, and the original 491 factories were reorganized and merged into 55 factories. Another example is the construction industry (electric sawmills, brick and tile, lime) factories, which are also small and scattered, but because most of the original equipment is fixed, relocation would reduce its use value, and decentralized production is more convenient for the masses, and production itself does not require too much concentration. Therefore, most of them adopted the method of linking without merging or merging less, unifying management and decentralized production among several factories. In addition, some factories were merged into state-owned factories, and individual factories with no development prospects were eliminated, and personnel were arranged by relevant government departments.

Of the more than 3,800 industrial enterprises in the city that newly implemented public-private partnerships this year, about 3,000 had been reorganized according to plan by the end of June, and the reorganization work of the remaining several hundred factories is continuing. The reorganization of most industries has achieved good results, but there are still some shortcomings in the reorganization of some industries that cannot be ignored. For example, the machinery industry overemphasized the manufacturing aspect and merged too many repair shops into manufacturing factories, resulting in an imbalance between manufacturing and repair, and tense repair cooperation relations. Some industries that directly serve the masses, such as the fire-fighting equipment industry and the typewriter industry, did not set up more retail outlets to facilitate customers after the reorganization. There are also some industries that inappropriately merged individual factories with expertise in producing a certain product with other factories, hindering their independent development.

In order to discover and better solve the shortcomings and remaining problems in the production reorganization, Guangzhou's industrial authorities recently widely solicited opinions from the city's business community. At present, various industrial professional companies are correcting some of the discovered shortcomings based on some useful opinions and suggestions they have put forward, so that these newly jointly operated enterprises can unleash greater potential power.

    广州公私合营厂初步完成生产改组
    产量增加，技术提高，充分显示公私合营的优越性
    新华社广州4日电　新华社记者方力报道：广州市今年年初实行公私合营的工业企业，经过初步的生产改组，生产潜力进一步发挥，大部分都能够担负起国家委托的比过去更大的生产任务。完成了改组工作的化工行业各新合营工厂，今年第三季度的生产总值，将要比第二季度增长近一半。纺织行业各厂的潜力发挥以后，今年第三季度的棉布、卫生衫裤和毛巾等产品的产量，都将超过历史上同期的最高水平。
    随着生产改组的进行，许多企业开始改变了原来的分散落后状态，平衡了技术设备，集中了技术力量，技术水平有了提高。一向只以修配或制造一些零件为主的机械行业，经过改组，现在能够独立生产一些重要的产品。如公和祥机器厂原来只能制造一百八十匹马力以下的蒸汽机，在这次改组中并进了十三个小厂以后，现在已经在试制三百八十匹马力的蒸汽机和锅驼机了。原来规模不大的同生机器厂，改组中并进了六家厂，现在已成为一家能够制造矿山机械、钻探机械和糖业机械的重型机械制造工厂。历来只能生产自行车零件的三十一家工厂合并改组以后，最近试制成功整架的自行车。经过改组的化工行业，已经试制成功并且开始生产六六六杀虫粉和钛白粉等十多种新产品或新品种。
    广州市在今年二月就开始规划新公私合营工业企业的生产改组工作。在制定改组规划过程中，有关部门对各行业的特点和产品种类、设备能力、技术力量、资金和供销情况、厂和厂之间的依存协作关系、厂房大小和职工住宿交通条件等情况，都一一作了调查，初步订出改组规划以后，又发动职工和资方人员研究讨论。各行业的改组规划，一般都经过三番四次的修改，在得到市的主管部门审核批准以后才定案。由于这样慎重，在制定改组规划初期一部分干部中出现的并大厂、要求大量投资扩建等不切实际的想法和做法，及时得到了批判和纠正。最后确定的规划，一般都做到了在有利于生产的原则下，尽量使工厂变动不太大，并且少扩建、少投资。在改组的形式上，也照顾了各行业以至各厂的特点。如机械行业原来厂小分散，工艺性高，生产任务很大，如果不适当的并厂和集中生产，将难以提高产品的产量和质量，因此在改组中就作了较大的裁并，将原来的四百九十一家工厂，改组合并为五十五家厂。又如建筑行业（电机锯木、砖瓦、石灰）各厂，同样是小而分散，但是因为原有设备多数是固定性的，搬迁会降低它的使用价值，而且这些厂分散生产对群众更加方便，生产本身也不需要太集中，因此多数采取了联而不并或少并的办法，将几个厂统一管理而分散生产。此外，还有一部分工厂并入国营工厂，有个别没有发展前途的工厂被淘汰，人员由政府有关部门安排。
    全市今年新实行公私合营的三千八百多家工业企业，到六月底为止约有三千家按照规划进行了改组，其余几百个工厂的改组工作正在继续进行。大部分行业的改组都得到了良好的效果，但是有些行业在改组中仍然有一些不容忽视的缺点。如机械行业由于过分强调了制造方面，把过多的修理厂并到制造厂里去了，造成现在制造和修理比重不平衡，修理协作关系紧张。还有一些直接为群众服务的行业，如消防器材业和打字机业，改组以后没有多设门市部方便顾客。还有一些行业，把个别生产某一产品有专长的工厂，不适当地同别的工厂合并，妨碍其独立发展。
    广州市工业主管部门为了发现和更好地解决生产改组中存在的缺点和遗留问题，最近曾经广泛征求全市工商界人士的意见。目前，各工业专业公司正在根据他们提出的一些有益的意见和建议，纠正一些已经发现的缺点，使这些新合营企业能够发挥出更大的潜在力量。
