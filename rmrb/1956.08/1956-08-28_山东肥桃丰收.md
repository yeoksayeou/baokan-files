    Shandong Feicheng Peaches Achieve a Bumper Harvest
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Jinan) Shandong Province's famous specialty, the juicy and sweet Feicheng peaches, are now on the market. Feicheng County, the place of origin for Feicheng peaches, has seen a bumper harvest this year from its 30,000 large peach trees. Agricultural cooperatives in Huangzhuang, Shangli, Nanguan and other towns, which are abundant in Feicheng peaches, have strengthened the horticultural management of peach trees this year, resulting in fruit-laden branches. Each tree bears 200 to 300 peaches, with large peaches weighing ten taels and small ones weighing over six taels. It is estimated that the county will produce over two million jin of peaches.
    Currently, the supply and marketing cooperative has specially established a Feicheng peach purchasing station, which can purchase more than 40,000 jin of ripe, high-quality peaches every day. The first batch of 300,000 jin has been successively transported to Tianjin, Nanjing, Jinan, and other places. (Wang Wen)

    山东肥桃丰收
    本报济南电　山东省著名的特产、多汁而香甜的肥桃登市。肥城桃的产地肥城县，三万棵大桃树今年普告丰收。盛产肥桃的黄庄、尚里、南关镇等地的农业社，由于今年加强了桃树的园艺管理，果实盈累，每棵结桃二百个到三百个，每个桃大的重十两，小的也有六两多。预计全县可产桃二百万斤以上。
    目前，供销社已专门设立了肥城桃收购站，每天能够收购到四万余斤成熟的好桃。第一批三十万斤已陆续运往天津、南京、济南等地。　（王文）
