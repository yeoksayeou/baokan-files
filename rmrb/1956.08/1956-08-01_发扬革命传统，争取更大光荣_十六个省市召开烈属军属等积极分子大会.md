    (Report from our newspaper) According to incomplete statistics, as of now, sixteen provinces and cities across the country have convened meetings of advanced workers among families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. These provinces and cities are: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Dalian.

    The participants in the conferences were all outstanding model figures from different work positions. Under the encouragement of the slogan "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," they used their perseverance and wisdom to create amazing miracles. More than 60% of the four hundred advanced workers who participated in the Beijing Municipal Conference had received various awards and commendations. Ding Shanfu, a demobilized construction soldier who returned to Anhui Province, was awarded a special merit during the war. After being assigned to the Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory in Huainan City, he diligently studied technology and creatively improved four types of tools, including radial drilling machines, greatly improving work efficiency and saving the country more than 2,800 yuan.

    Chen Shunzhang, deputy director of the Shangwen Township Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinyi County, Guangdong Province, who is deeply loved by the masses, is a disabled veteran of special grade who was unwilling to accept life-long support from the state and resolutely requested to return to his hometown to participate in agricultural production. Chen Shunzhang had been awarded merit four times during the Liberation War and later joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, where he lost ten fingers and both feet to enemy shells during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. After returning to his hometown, he took the lead in organizing an agricultural production cooperative and often ran around on a pair of artificial legs despite hardship. With his help, several cooperatives in the township that had disbanded or were about to disband were re-consolidated and expanded, and smoothly transitioned to advanced cooperatives.

    Tian Changmei, the 62-year-old mother of Miao nationality martyr Long Shichang, a second-class hero and special-class meritorious person of the Chinese People's Volunteers, still actively participates in labor. Over the years, she has not only refused preferential treatment and care from the government, but also helped other military families in the vicinity who lacked labor to carry water, chop firewood, and manage household affairs.

    During the conference in Shaanxi Province, more than 200 paintings and photographs were exhibited. These pictures vividly depicted the model deeds of many advanced workers and introduced the government's preferential treatment work for families of martyrs and military personnel and the resettlement work for demobilized construction soldiers in recent years. The pictures show that more than 95% of the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in the province have participated in agricultural production cooperatives. From 1954 to 1955, the subsidies issued by the government to the families of martyrs and military personnel in the province could buy more than 11,000 head of cattle.

    At the conferences held in various places, the advanced workers reported on their work achievements and exchanged work experiences with each other. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would continue to work hard in different work positions and contribute to the country's socialist construction cause.

    During the conferences, many advanced workers were rewarded, and representatives were selected to attend the upcoming National Conference of Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction among Families of Martyrs, Military Personnel, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, and Demobilized Construction Soldiers to be held in Beijing.

    发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣
    十六个省市召开烈属军属等积极分子大会
    本报讯　据不完全统计，到目前为止，全国已有十六个省、市召开了烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人积极分子大会。这些省、市是：内蒙古自治区、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、陕西、青海、山东、安徽、浙江、广东、广西、贵州，以及北京、上海、武汉和旅大市。
    参加大会的都是来自不同工作岗位的优秀模范人物。他们在“发扬革命传统、争取更大光荣”这一口号的鼓舞下，用自己的毅力和智慧，创造了惊人的奇迹。参加北京市大会的四百多名积极分子，有60％以上曾经受过各种奖励和表扬。回到安徽省的复员建设军人丁善甫，在战场上曾立过特等功；当他被分配到淮南市蔡家岗矿山机械厂以后，就刻苦钻研技术，创造性地改进了摇臂钻床等四种工具，大大提高了工作效率，为国家节省二千八百多元。
    深受群众爱戴的广东省信宜县尚文乡第二农业生产合作社副主任陈顺章，是一位不愿接受国家的终生供养，而坚决要求回乡参加农业生产的特等残废军人。陈顺章曾在解放战争中先后立功四次，以后又参加了中国人民志愿军，在抗美援朝斗争中被侵略者的炮弹夺去了十个手指和双脚，他回到家乡以后，带头组织起农业生产合作社，经常不辞艰苦地架着一双假脚到处奔跑。在他的帮助下，乡里几个曾经散了伙和将要散伙的合作社，重新巩固和扩大了，并且顺利地转为高级社。
    中国人民志愿军二级英雄、特等功臣苗族龙世昌烈士的母亲田长妹，今年已六十二岁，但仍积极参加劳动。几年来她不但不要政府的优待和照顾，而且自己还去帮助附近其他缺乏劳动力的军属担水、打柴和料理家务。
    陕西省在大会期间，展出了二百多幅图画和照片。这些图片生动地描绘了许多积极分子的模范事迹，并介绍了政府几年来的对烈属军属的优抚工作和对复员建设军人的安置工作。图片表明，全省烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人中已有95％以上参加了农业生产合作社。1954到1955年期间，政府给全省烈属、军属发放的补助费，可买一万一千多头耕牛。
    在各地举行的大会上，积极分子们都汇报了自己的工作成绩，相互交流了工作经验，大家一致表示：要在不同的工作岗位上继续努力，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献力量。
    大会期间，许多积极分子都受到了奖励，并选出了出席即将在北京召开的全国烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。
