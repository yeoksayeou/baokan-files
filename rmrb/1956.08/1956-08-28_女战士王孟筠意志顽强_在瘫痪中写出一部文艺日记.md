Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 27th: Wang Mengyun, a female youth league member of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who is completely paralyzed and completely deaf, has written a literary diary of more than 100,000 words on her hospital bed for more than two years. This diary records the entire process of her fighting stubbornly against serious illnesses. At the first creation conference of the Military Region Production and Construction Corps held at the end of July, this work received attention, and relevant departments are helping her revise it and prepare it for publication.

Wang Mengyun is from Changsha, Hunan Province, and is only eighteen years old this year. In March 1952, attracted by the beautiful ideal of building the frontier, Wang Mengyun, who was fourteen years old, was admitted to the recruitment group of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. She worked in the Xinjiang "August 1st" Iron and Steel Factory, a local state-owned enterprise. Later, she suffered from rheumatic arthritis. After recovering, she was transferred to the "August 1st" Farm in the Urumqi reclamation area as a clerk. In the second half of 1953, her arthritis relapsed, and she suffered from otitis media and other diseases, her legs became paralyzed, and her ears became deaf. At first, she felt pessimistic and desperate because of the pain of the illness and worried about becoming disabled in the future. However, she was finally inspired by the heroic images of Paul and Wu Yunduo from the two books "How Steel Was Made" and "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and developed a tenacious will to fight against the disease. She endured the severe pain in her leg joints, practiced walking step by step with crutches, and learned to understand the meaning of speech by watching the other person's mouth movements. It was with such a tenacious will that Wang Mengyun used her right hand, which often cramped and trembled, to write down her experiences of fighting against the disease in the past two years on her hospital bed.

    女战士王孟筠意志顽强
    在瘫痪中写出一部文艺日记
    据新华社乌鲁木齐27日电　中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队一个全身瘫痪、两耳全聋的女青年团员王孟筠，两年多来在医院的病床上写出了一部十余万字文艺日记，这部日记记述了她同严重的疾病作顽强斗争的整个过程。在7月底召开的军区生产建设部队首届创作会议上，这部作品受到了重视，有关部门正在帮助她修改并且准备出版。
    王孟筠是湖南长沙人，今年只有十八岁。1952年3月，十四岁的王孟筠在建设边疆的美好理想吸引下，考上了人民解放军新疆军区工作招聘团，她在地方国营新疆八一钢铁厂工作时，患了风湿性关节炎，在治愈以后调到乌鲁木齐垦区八一农场担任缮写员。1953年下半年，她的关节炎复发，并患了中耳炎等多种疾病，双腿瘫软，两耳也聋了。开头，她曾因疾病的痛苦折磨和担心将来成为残废，产生过悲观绝望情绪。但是，她终于从“钢铁是怎样炼成的”和“把一切献给党”这两本书中，受到保尔、吴运铎英雄形象的鼓舞，产生了同疾病作斗争的顽强意志。她忍受着腿部关节剧烈疼痛，用拐杖一步一步练习走路，学会了用眼睛看对方嘴巴的动作来了解说话的意思。王孟筠就是用这样顽强的意志，在病床上用常常抽筋和抖颤的右手，写下了自己两年来同疾病作斗争的经过。
