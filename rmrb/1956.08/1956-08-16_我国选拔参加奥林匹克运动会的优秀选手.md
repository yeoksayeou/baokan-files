    Our country's selection competition for outstanding marksmen began on the 15th at the shooting range in the western suburbs of Beijing. This competition will determine the composition of our country's delegation to participate in the 16th Olympic Games shooting competition. The results of this competition will be officially included in the national records, and athletes with excellent results will also be awarded rank titles.

    Forty-five male and female amateur shooting athletes are participating in this selection competition (of which ten female athletes will not participate in the Olympic Games). The competition events for men are exactly the same as the shooting competition events stipulated by the 16th Olympic Games, including free pistol slow fire and rapid fire, free small-bore rifle 3x40 standard shooting, free small-bore rifle sixty-shot prone, free large-bore rifle 3x40 standard shooting, clay pigeon (i.e. skeet) and running deer target, a total of seven events. The women's competition event is the free small-bore rifle 3x20 standard shooting event.
