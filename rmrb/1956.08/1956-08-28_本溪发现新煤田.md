    Benxi Discovers New Coalfield
    According to Xinhua News Agency, coalfield exploration personnel have discovered a new coalfield in the Xiaoshi area of Benxi city's suburbs. Small earthen kilns were opened in the Xiaoshi coalfield a long time ago, but its area and reserves were unknown. This year's drilling results revealed three or four minable coal seams with a thickness of 1.5 meters or more. Based on the existing data, constructing a coal mine on this coalfield could produce approximately 500,000 to 600,000 tons of coal annually.
    The Xiaoshi coalfield has convenient transportation, and high-voltage power transmission lines also pass through it, which are favorable conditions for future mining. Currently, exploration personnel are collecting data for mine construction.

    本溪发现新煤田
    据新华社讯　煤田勘探人员在本溪市郊小市地区发现了一块新煤田。小市煤田很早以前曾经有人开过小土窑，但是不知道它的面积和储藏量。今年钻探结果，发现可采煤层有三、四层，厚度达一点五公尺以上。根据已经有的资料，在这块煤田上建设煤矿，每年约可以产煤五十万吨到六十万吨。
    小市煤田交通方便，高压送电线路也经过那里，这是今后开采的有利条件。现在，勘探人员正在为建井搜集资料。
