    Beijing News: Shenyang's twenty-five state-owned and locally state-owned machinery factories, with one hundred and twenty-eight departments, have launched an inter-factory competition among departments since April of this year, beginning to reverse the long-standing situation where department management work lags behind workshop production activities.
    The departments participating in this competition include six categories such as design, technology, tooling, supply, inspection, and wages. In the competition, they overcame the working methods of "sitting in a well and looking at the sky" and "closing the door and guarding themselves," mutually exchanged and learned advanced experiences, and carried out material mutual assistance. Currently, more than ten units in the city have learned from the error-free design competition launched by the design department of the Shenyang Transformer Factory. After implementing methods such as quality scoring, the design department of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory has significantly reduced drawing design errors. Some factories have repeatedly gone to the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory to learn about the experience of launching excellent inspector competitions. After the inspection personnel of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory learned and promoted this experience, the average monthly scrap rate has dropped to 0.9%, meeting the requirements of the national plan indicators.
    Through the development of inter-factory department competitions, the work enthusiasm and initiative of department personnel have been further stimulated, effectively ensuring the completion of department work tasks. The tooling department of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory has solved the past problems of chaotic tool management and untimely supply. The supply department of the Shenyang Radiator Factory collected more than 2,000 tons of scrap pig iron from various places, meeting the needs of production. The inspection department of this factory established and improved more than ten systems such as scrap analysis in the second quarter, and most of them were implemented relatively completely.
    After the development of inter-factory department competitions, a new atmosphere has generally emerged in various departments. Since the launch of the excellent inspector competition in twenty-two factories, more than five hundred and eighty outstanding inspectors have emerged, and the scrap rate of nineteen units has been reduced. When Wang Tianxing, a worker in the tooling workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, made a "copper sleeve," he misread the drawings. After being discovered by the inspector, he was immediately corrected, avoiding the scrapping of a large number of parts. The worker was very grateful to the inspector. Many workshop cadres and workers said: "Department personnel are really creating favorable conditions for workshop production at any time."
    Therefore, at the second quarterly inter-factory competition awards conference held by the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China, eighteen units, including the design department of the Shenyang Transformer Factory and the tooling department of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, were rewarded. Another twelve units were commended.

    沈阳25个机械厂开展厂际科室竞赛
    开始扭转科室工作落后于生产的情况
    随时为车间创造完成任务的有利条件
    本报讯　沈阳二十五个国营、地方国营机械工厂的一百二十八个科室，从今年四月份开展厂际同科室竞赛后，开始扭转了长期存在的科室管理工作落后于车间生产活动的情况。
    参加这次竞赛的科室中，有设计、工艺、工具、供应、检查和工资等六类。他们在竞赛中克服了“坐井观天”，“闭门自守”的工作方式，互相交流、学习了先进经验和进行了材料互济等工作。目前，全市有十多个单位学习了沈阳变压器厂设计科开展的无差错设计竞赛。沈阳第二机床厂设计科的人员，实行了质量记分等方法后，图纸设计错误显著减少。有些工厂曾经多次到沈阳风动工具厂学习开展优秀检查员竞赛等经验。沈阳高压开关厂检查人员学习和推广了这一经验后，平均每月废品率已降到0.9％，达到了国家计划指标的要求。
    通过厂际同科室竞赛的开展，更加发挥了科室人员的工作积极性和主动性，有效地保证了科室工作任务的完成。沈阳空气压缩机厂工具科人员曾解决了过去存在的刀具管理紊乱和供应不及时的情况。沈阳暖气器材厂供应科人员，到各处搜集了废生铁二千多吨，满足了生产上的需要。这个厂的检查科，在第二季度里建立和健全了废品分析等十多种制度，大多数都比较完备地执行了。
    在开展厂际同科室竞赛后，各科室都普遍地出现了新气象。二十二个工厂自开展优秀检查员竞赛后，即已涌现出五百八十多名优秀检查员，其中有十九个单位的废品率有了降低。沈阳第一机床厂工具车间工人王天兴在做“铜套”时看错了图纸，被检查员发现后立刻给以纠正，避免了大批部件报废，这个工人非常感激检查员。许多车间干部和工人说：“科室人员真是随时都在为车间生产创造有利条件。”
    因此，在中国第一机械工会沈阳市委员会召开的第二季度厂际竞赛奖励大会上，有沈阳变压器厂设计科、沈阳第二机床厂工具科等十八个单位曾受到奖励。另有十二个单位受到了表扬。
