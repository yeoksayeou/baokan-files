    I Saw Sandy Beaches Turned into Fertile Fields
    Zhu Xuefan
    Recently, I had the opportunity to go to Qufu County in Shandong Province, where I stayed for a few days. It is the hometown of Confucius. The residence and temple of the Kong family occupy almost half of the entire county seat. Emperors and generals of past dynasties erected many tall and large steles in the temple, filled with eulogies. The Kong family's cemetery—Kong Lin (Confucius Forest), occupies 29 hectares and 41 mu outside the north gate of the county seat, forming a rare man-made large garden.
    However, the people of Confucius' hometown did not become wealthy because their hometown produced a "Sage Teacher." In the long years before liberation, except for a few bureaucrats and landlords who lived by exploitation, ordinary people, despite a lifetime of hard work, could only obtain a meager amount of living materials. They spent their days farming small plots of land scattered about or working for landlords, never getting enough to eat or wear, and were even more vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters.
    To the north of Qufu County, there is an alkaline river, which the people call "Xiang He" (Noisy River) or "Xian He" (Dangerous River). This is because the river's turbulent current roars loudly during floods; it often floods and causes disasters.
    On the right bank of the Alkali River is a village called Chenjia Village. The villagers told us that the small temple in front of the village was originally built in the northwest corner behind the village, but now it is in the southwest corner in front of the village. Did the temple move? No. This is because the bank of the Alkali River constantly collapses, and large pieces of fertile land collapse into the river. Farmers have no way to stop the collapse, so they have to move to avoid it. One family moved, then another, and so on year after year, the whole village moved from southwest of the small temple to the north of the small temple. How many fertile fields and estates have been lost in this riverbed! In addition, although facing such a large river, the crops often lack water. In short, it is either flooding or drought, and the people have suffered too much from it.
    Qufu was liberated in 1948. The Communist Party and the People's Government led the farmers to carry out land reform and then led them to organize themselves and take the socialist road, so that they could gradually get rid of poverty. In 1949, Chenjia Village established two mutual aid teams of 20 households. In the autumn of 1952, a primary cooperative was established. In January 1956, the nine small cooperatives in Lizhuang Township were merged to form the Chenjia Village Advanced Cooperative. In just a few years, the production and life of the farmers have undergone fundamental changes.
    When the villagers began to organize, the Party taught them to study afforestation and prevent wind, sand, and floods. However, the farmers were doubtful whether the trees they planted would survive. Some of the masses said, "Planting trees in sandy wastelands where nothing grows is a waste of seedlings and labor." After the Party's education and specific assistance, everyone began to try planting, and finally the seedlings survived. By 1950, a total of 29,000 trees had been planted, with a survival rate of over 95%. In 1952 alone, the income from firewood and grass was more than 15,000 jin, and large areas of sandy soil began to be greened. From 1950 to 1955, a total of more than 90,000 trees of various kinds were planted, almost all of which survived, and seven mu of land was planted with various fruit trees. As the trees grew, the income from firewood and grass also increased. Last year alone, more than 200,000 jin of tree branches and firewood were harvested, which, calculated at one yuan per hundred jin, amounted to more than two thousand yuan. I followed the villagers to the forest and saw with my own eyes that a large area of ​​river滩 that was originally loose sand had a layer of drifting soil, and the soil quality on the ground had changed. Wherever there was forest, the soil was no longer loose dry sand. On the large area of ​​land silted up on the edge of the forest, the crops grew tall and lush. The villagers told me that on these silted lands, 40 mu of wheat were planted last year, yielding 9,200 jin, and 200 mu of peanuts yielded 9,000 jin.
    The living facts encouraged the members' enthusiasm for afforestation. Every early spring, men and women, old and young, planted trees happily on the entire sandy beach. I saw the more than 1,000 mu of new young forest planted from January to April this year, with 400,000 to 500,000 green seedlings, already surviving. There is the "March 8th Women's Forest" planted by the female members; there is the "Youth Orchard" cultivated by the young men. Chen Yimei, the director of the cooperative, told me that they plan to turn all the more than 2,000 mu of sandy wasteland into forest within two years. A windbreak forest of five rows of arbors and four rows of shrubs is to be built along the river, and 500 mu of fruit tree orchards are to be developed, with large-scale planting of apples, peaches, apricots, persimmons, dates, and mulberry trees. In three years, they want to achieve: sandy wasteland becoming forest, roads becoming shaded. They also have a lovely plan to build a grape trellis on every well in the township. Now 150 grape trellises have been built on 200 wells. After these grapes grow, they can not only increase sideline income, but also provide shade for people and animals when watering the land.
    The trees planted in recent years have gradually become forests, which has brought many benefits to the cooperative's sideline production. For example, the flowering of fruit trees creates natural conditions for beekeeping and honey collection. The cooperative now has nine hives of bees, and it is expected to develop to 20 hives in the second half of this year. One hive of bees can produce 60 jin of honey, which is obviously a considerable income; the planted mulberry trees can develop silkworm farming; and the wild grass plants spreading in the forest garden provide feed for livestock. Last year, they raised 200 sheep, and it is estimated that the income from wool alone will be more than 500 yuan. The breeding of mules, horses, pigs, cattle, and other livestock has increased the power and fertilizer for agricultural production.
    The results of afforestation in Chenjia Village have not only increased sideline production, but also transformed the natural environment in this area and overcome disasters. Due to the growth of trees, sandy beaches have become fertile fields, and the threats of wind, sand, floods, bank collapses, and land collapses have been basically eliminated. The riverbed is stable, and the villagers no longer have to move to avoid the river. The root of the disaster has become a source of creating a rich and beautiful life. Let us take a look at the agricultural income of Chenjia Village. Before liberation, the average yield per mu was only 60 or 70 jin. In 1952, the average per mu reached 269 jin. Last year, the yield per mu has increased to 450 jin. The actual income of all farmers has increased in recent years.
    This fact of changing the environment and increasing yields eloquently proves that the power of man can overcome nature. Of course, this is only possible when the people embark on the road of collectivization.
    Chenjia Village in Qufu is only a small corner of the motherland, but like other places, it shows the new face of today's countryside and also depicts the beautiful future prospects of the new Chinese countryside.

    我看到了沙滩变良田
    朱学范
    最近，我获得去山东曲阜县的机会，在那里住了几天。那是孔子的故乡。孔家的府第和圣庙建筑，占据了整个县城的将近一半，历代帝王将相，在庙里树立很多又高又大的碑碣，满是歌功颂德的赞词。孔子的墓园——孔林，占用了县城北门外29顷41亩，构成一个罕有的人造大园林。
    可是，孔子家乡的老百姓，过去并没有因为他们家乡出了个“至圣先师”，而使生活富裕。在解放以前的漫长岁月里，除了少数依靠剥削为生的官僚地主而外，一般老百姓尽管是一辈子辛勤劳动，也仅能得到一点少得可怜的生活资料。他们终年在小块土地上分散地耕种，或是帮地主干活，吃不饱，穿不暖，更经不起天灾人祸的袭击。
    在曲阜县迤北，有一条碱河，老百姓把它叫做“响河”或叫“险河”。因为这条河大水时湍急的潮流哗哗作响；常常发水出险成灾。
    碱河右岸有个村庄——陈家庄。庄前有个小庙，庄上人告诉我们，这个庙本来是建在庄后西北角上的，现在这个庙却到了庄前西南角上去了。是庙宇搬家了吗？不是。这是因为碱河河岸经常塌土，大块良田往河里倒塌，农民没法阻止倒河，只有搬家避让。一家搬了又是一家，就这样一年年的迁移，整个村庄由小庙西南搬到小庙的北面去了。就在这条河床里，不知陷落了多少良田庄园。另外，虽然面对这样一条大河，可是庄稼地里却常常缺水。总之不是泛滥成灾，就是闹旱荒，老百姓受它的害是太多了。
    1948年曲阜解放了，共产党、人民政府领导农民进行了土地改革，又领导他们组织起来走社会主义道路，才逐渐能摆脱贫困日子。陈家庄在1949年成立了20户的两个互助组，1952年秋成立了初级合作社，1956年1月又由李庄乡全乡的九个小社，合并成立了陈家庄高级社。短短的几年，农民的生产和生活起了根本的变化。
    当老乡们开始组织起来之后，党教导他们研究植树造林，防止风沙洪水。但是农民们对于栽了树能不能成活，是有疑虑的。一部分群众说：“寸草不生的沙窝里栽树，那是赔上树苗又赔工”。经过党的教育和具体帮助，大家开始进行试种，终于把树苗栽活了。到1950年共栽29，000株，成活率达到了95％以上，在1952年，这一年光是柴草收入就有15，000余斤，大片沙土开始绿化了。从1950年到1955年，共计种了各种树木九万多株，几乎是百分之百都成活了，其中有七亩地并且种上了各种果木树。随着树木的成长，柴草收入也就多了。去年光是树枝柴草，就收得二十多万斤，以一元百斤计算，就收入了二千多元。我随老乡们去树林里，亲眼看到一大片原来是散沙的河滩，挂上了一层游土，地上土质已经发生了变化，凡是成林的地方，土壤已不是松散的干沙了。树林边缘积淤出来的大片土地上，庄稼长得又高又肥，老乡们告诉我，在这些积淤出来的土地上，去年种了40亩小麦，收了9，200斤，200亩花生收了9，000斤。
    活生生的事实鼓舞了社员们造林的劳动热情。每到初春季节，男女老少在整个沙滩上，兴高采烈地植树。我看到他们今年一月到四月新造的一千多亩幼林，四、五十万株幼苗，绿油油地一片已经成活了。这里有女社员们手植的“三八妇女林”；有小伙子们培育的“青年果园”。合作社陈以梅主任告诉我，他们计划要在两年内把两千多亩沙荒河滩全部造成树林。沿河要造一道五行乔木、四行灌木的防风林，还要发展500亩果树园，大量种植苹果，桃，杏，柿，枣和蚕桑，要在三年后达到：沙荒成林，道路成荫。他们还有一个可爱的计划，要在全乡所有的浇地水井上，每眼井上都搭上一个葡萄架。现在200眼井上已搭成150个葡萄架了。这些葡萄成长之后，不但可以增加副业收入，还可以在浇地操作时，使人畜得到遮阴。
    几年来所栽的树木已经逐渐成林，它给合作社的副业生产也带来了许多好处。比如果树开花，就给养蜂采蜜创造了自然条件，合作社里现在已养了九窝蜜蜂，预计今年下半年将发展到20窝，一窝蜂可以生产60斤蜂蜜，显然是一笔很可观的收入；种植的桑树成林，可以发展养蚕；林园里蔓延的野草植物，又提供了牲口畜牧的饲料，去年他们养了200头羊，预计一年光是羊毛收入就有500多元。骡马猪牛等牲畜的繁殖，增加了农业生产动力和肥料。
    陈家庄植树造林的成果，不仅增加了副业生产，更大的意义，还在于改造了这一带的自然环境，克服了灾害。由于树木的成长，沙滩变成了良田，风沙、洪水、塌岸、倒田的威胁基本上消除了，河床稳定，老乡们不再迁家让河了。灾害的祸根，成了创造丰富美好生活的泉源。让我们再看看陈家庄的农业收入吧，解放前每亩地的收成，平均只有六、七十斤，1952年每亩平均达到了269斤，去年每亩地已经提高到450斤了。所有的农户，几年来的实际收入都有增加。
    这一改变环境、提高产量的事实，雄辩地证明了：人的力量是可以战胜自然的。当然，也只有人民走上集体化道路才有可能。
    曲阜陈家庄，它仅是祖国的一个小小角落，可是它和其他地方一样，它显示了今日农村的新面貌，也描绘出了未来的新中国农村的美好远景。
