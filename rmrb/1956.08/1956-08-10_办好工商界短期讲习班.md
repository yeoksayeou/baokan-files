Run the Short-Term Study Class for Industrial and Commercial Circles Well
    崔月犁

Editor's Note: The Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Short-Term Study Class was very successful. The first group of students in this study class has already graduated. When they first entered the study class, they had many ideological concerns, believing that the study class would definitely be more severe than the Five-Anti Campaign, and that once they went to study, they shouldn't expect to return. Before entering the study class, they even entrusted their wives and children to close friends to take care of. However, after a period of study, these concerns were eliminated, their political awareness was raised, and they felt that "their initial thoughts were really ridiculous, fully demonstrating their bourgeois ideology," and expressed that "in the future, they must listen to the Party and the government, follow the Communist Party, transform themselves well, become new industrialists and businessmen, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction." The teaching experience of this study class can be used as a reference.

The Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Short-Term Study Class is mainly organized by the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, with the participation and assistance of relevant business bureaus. The first phase ended on June 26th, lasting for a total of twelve weeks. A total of 1,968 private sector personnel participated in the study, divided into 149 groups according to industry, with 76 full-time or part-time cadres transferred from various professional companies to serve as instructors. The students were concentrated in class to listen to lectures, and the bureaus and professional companies arranged places for them to study and discuss on their own.

This study class studied political common sense and enterprise reform knowledge. The textbook for political common sense was the "Political Common Sense Textbook for Industrialists and Businessmen" (draft) compiled by the Study Magazine, which was taught twice a week for a total of eight weeks, including review time. Because there were no suitable teaching materials for the basic knowledge of enterprise reform, the responsible comrades of the relevant business bureaus gave four lectures each for industry and commerce, focusing on the current problems in enterprise reform and combining the principles of socialist enterprise management, for a total of three weeks.

The private sector personnel participating in this study class generally have a primary school education, and most of them have rarely participated in learning in the past. Their understanding of the socialist transformation policy for private industry and commerce is relatively poor. Therefore, at the beginning of the study class, although most people attached importance to this study, recognizing that "being able to study full-time is the Party and the government's greatest concern for themselves," many people still had many concerns. Some people thought that "the Five-Anti Campaign was so severe that they didn't even take people away from their jobs, this time it must be even more severe, and once they go to study, they shouldn't expect to return." Before participating in the study, they entrusted their wives and children to close friends to take care of in advance. Some people guessed that "probably I offended the public shareholders, so they let me participate in the study, to fix me." Therefore, after the start of school, they were determined to "talk less, kowtow more, to avoid being fixed"; others were "going with the wind, perfunctorily coping." In response to this situation, the Industrial and Commercial Circles Learning Office took the following measures.

I. Repeatedly explain the policies and constantly dispel ideological concerns. At the beginning of the school year, a mobilization report was made to the students, explaining the purpose and methods of the study, but many people were still "half-believing" and "uneasy," thinking that "perhaps it is sweet first and then bitter." More than two weeks after the start of the school year, another report was made to address their ideological concerns about being subjected to counter-revolutionary purges, ideological rectification, struggle sessions, and being forced to give up fixed interest, and they were organized to discuss it. In order to further dispel their ideological concerns, they were later told that the study class would not hold examinations, conduct ideological checks, make study evaluations, write study summaries, or any other written materials.

II. Seriously enlighten them to be conscious and voluntary in their studies. Do not emphasize that theory must be linked to practice, and do not call for criticism and self-criticism; as long as they consciously and voluntarily talk about it, it does not matter if they talk about it wrong, do not have any ideological concerns, and do not have any compulsion; of course, it is a sign of progress to talk more about it in connection with reality, and it is not considered backward if there is ideological progress but little or no talk on the mouth, talking or not talking, talking more or less is completely conscious and voluntary, and no one is allowed to have any compulsion on others. In order to implement this principle, the Study Office convened seven or eight meetings of instructors, repeatedly explaining this principle according to the specific situation, and repeatedly explained this issue to them at some meetings.

III. In terms of teaching, focus on explaining from the positive side, persuading people with reason, and combining it with figurative education. For their wrong ideas, mainly use a patient and persuasive attitude, focusing on enlightening them from the positive side, and persuading them from the perspective of reason. For example, in response to their nostalgia for the past, on the one hand, they were told about the laws of social development and the inevitable trends. At the same time, they were also focused on the bright future of socialism and the benefits of joint state-private ownership to the country and industrialists and businessmen. After studying, many people said: "This is the roundabout way," "I feel bright in my heart, really like drilling out of the clouds," "After a long time, it turns out that engaging in joint state-private ownership is to build socialism together with the people of the whole country."

Combining the content of the lectures, organizing students to watch movies, visit state-owned factories, agricultural production cooperatives, and exhibitions, etc., had very good results. For example, after watching the movie Dong Cunrui, they were generally moved. Many people said: "Compared with Dong Cunrui, my own individualistic thoughts of gains and losses are really too wrong"; after watching the movie "Moscow Under Construction," many people said: "Going to such a happy socialism, what worries do I still have?"

IV. Use various lively and active forms to encourage students' learning enthusiasm. The Study Class Office compiled and printed a "Study Gazette" to publicly report on the learning situation, encourage and praise, and in the past two months, the gazette received 768 submissions from students, and published more than 20 issues. Many students felt that the gazette had "a lot of inspiration" for themselves and expressed that "they want to learn from those who study well." The study groups of various bureaus and professional companies also carried out extracurricular collective activities under the specific guidance of the instructors, such as publishing wall newspapers, practicing work breaks, engaging in collective games, and learning to sing. Some units also held several evening parties, with students composing allegro, crosstalk and other programs to sing. These collective activities were deeply welcomed by them, touched their hearts, and made them feel that the learning life in the study class was warm and amiable. After school at 6:00 pm every day, some people stayed to chat, study on their own or write articles for the wall newspaper.

V. Government business bureaus and companies all attached importance to their study and cared about them in their lives. In addition to preparing the necessary learning conditions for them, the bureaus also purchased necessary learning tools for them. During the study period, the responsible comrades of various bureaus and professional companies went to the study groups to understand their learning situation. They felt that the leaders were very "concerned and attached importance" to their study and were very moved, expressing that "they must study hard with peace of mind."

After the above measures and studies, they gradually realized that the study class was "entirely to help industrialists and businessmen progress" and felt that "their initial ideas were really ridiculous" and "fully demonstrated their bourgeois ideology." Some said: "The Communist Party is too good, using persuasive education methods, we naturally become enthusiastic about learning." For example, one student did not say a word for two weeks after entering school. Under the influence of patient and persuasive positive education and enlightenment, he finally dispelled various fears and corrected incorrect ideas, changed from being taciturn to an active member of the group study, and said at the end of the school year that "I didn't want to come when I came, but now I don't want to leave." Because they gradually dispelled their ideological concerns, their learning enthusiasm became higher and higher. Later, they could generally talk about relatively real thoughts in connection with reality, and the group discussion speeches were also relatively active and natural.

Through this study class, the vast majority of private sector personnel participating in the study weakened their nostalgia for the past, strengthened their confidence in the future, reduced their concerns about socialism, and laid a preliminary foundation for "breaking capitalism and establishing socialism" in their ideological understanding. Many people said during the study: "Social development is heading towards socialism, the country is moving towards socialism, and industrialists and businessmen must of course take the socialist path to have a future." "We must take the socialist road of the rising sun, and never take the capitalist road of the setting sun." Some people used to think that "the Communist Party's policies will never be beneficial to me, and through this study, I realized that I also have a future in engaging in socialism." Many people also examined the erroneous attitude of "less contact with public shareholders, less talking with workers, less meddling in other people's business" and "obeying the orders of public shareholders, knowing that it is wrong, but not making suggestions" after joint state-private ownership, and expressed that "in the future, they must listen to the Party and the government, follow the Communist Party, transform themselves well, become new industrialists and businessmen, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction."

After returning to the enterprise from the study class, the private sector personnel who participated in the study generally became much more active and proactive in their work than before the study, and dared to make suggestions. Ming Guangxin, the private sector technical deputy section chief of the joint state-private battery factory, was reluctant to take responsibility for his work in the past, and did not disclose his technology, and his relationship with the workers was not good. Now he not only disclosed the technology for manufacturing Changbei brand batteries, but also regularly went deep into the workshop to guide the improvement of storage battery manufacturing, and took the initiative to ask the workers to make a self-criticism. Chen Jinkai, the private sector technical section chief of Qiangsheng Movie Projector Factory, put forward three work systems for pre-production preparation, production scheduling meetings, and life hygiene, in response to the lack of systems in the factory's production management. The public shareholder representatives supported their active performance, and the employees also believed that their "thinking has indeed improved."

From the work of this study class, it can be seen that: First, the holding of study classes for industrial and commercial circles must be different from the holding of cadre training classes, and the teaching principles and teaching methods of cadre training classes cannot be mechanically copied. Do not emphasize that theory must be linked to practice, and must carry out criticism and self-criticism; but focus on dispelling concerns, emphasizing enlightening their learning consciousness, promoting democracy, and free debate. Second, we must firmly grasp the leadership of policy and ideology. The principles and methods of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on holding study classes are correct, but this policy is not easy to thoroughly implement. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly educate all cadres who come into contact with them and specifically help cadres to deeply understand the policy spirit of running study classes. Third, since this is a new work and lacks experience, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of all relevant parties, not only to transfer a certain number of strong cadres to participate in this work, but also for various business bureaus to closely cooperate and help. At the same time, it is even more necessary to give full play to the role of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, and to make full use of the positive activists in the industrial and commercial circles to do the work.

    办好工商界短期讲习班
    崔月犁
    编者按　北京市工商界短期讲习班办得很成功。这个讲习班的第一期学员已经结业。他们开始进讲习班的时候，思想顾虑很多，认为讲习班一定比五反还厉害，这次去学习，就别想回来了，在进讲习班以前还把自己的老婆、孩子交给知己朋友照顾。可是经过一个时期的学习以后，他们的这些顾虑消除了，政治觉悟提高了，感到“自己当初的想法实在可笑，十足表现了自己的资产阶级思想”，表示“今后一定听党和政府的话，跟着共产党走，好好改造自己，做一个新工商业者，在社会主义建设事业中贡献出力量。”这个讲习班的教学经验可供参考。
    北京市工商界短期讲习班是以市工商业联合会和民主建国会北京市分会为主，并在各有关业务局的参与和协助下举办的。第一期已在六月二十六日结业，时间共十二周。参加学习的私方人员共1，968人，按行业编为149个小组，由各专业公司抽调专职或兼职干部76人担任辅导工作。学员集中上课听讲，各局和各专业公司分别给他们安排自学、讨论的地点。
    这期讲习班学习了政治常识和企业改革知识。政治常识的教材是采用学习杂志社编的“工商业者政治常识课本”（初稿），每周讲两次，连复习时间在内，共学了八周。企业改革的基本知识因无适当教材，由各有关业务局的负责同志针对当前企业改革中的问题，并结合社会主义企业经营管理的原则，分工业、商业各讲了四讲，共学了三周。
    参加这期讲习班学习的私方人员一般是小学文化程度，而且，大多数在过去很少参加学习，他们对私营工商业社会主义改造政策的认识较差。因此，在讲习班开学初期，虽然大多数人对这次学习是重视的，认识到“能够脱产学习，是党和政府对自己的最大关怀”，但是，还有许多人疑虑重重。有些人认为“五反那么厉害，都没有脱产，这回一定比五反还厉害，这次去学习，就别想回来了。”在未参加学习以前，将老婆、孩子预先拜托给知己朋友照应。有些人则猜疑“大概是得罪了公股，才让我参加学习，好整我一下”。因此，在开学以后，便抱定“少说话，多磕头，免得挨整”的态度；还有些人则是“顺风使舵，敷衍应付”。针对这种情况，工商界学习办公室采取了以下一些措施。
    一、反复交代政策，不断解除思想顾虑。开学的时候，曾对学员作了动员报告，交代了学习的目的和方法，但是仍有不少人“半信半疑”，“放心不下”，以为“或许是先甜后苦”。在开学两个多星期以后，又针对他们怕搞肃反，怕整思想，怕被斗争，怕让放弃定息等思想顾虑作了报告，并让他们组织讨论。为了进一步解除他们的思想顾虑，后来，又向他们交代学习班不举行考试，不进行思想检查，不搞学习鉴定，不写学习小结以及其他任何书面材料。
    二、认真启发他们在学习中自觉自愿。不强调理论必须联系实际，不号召必须展开批评与自我批评；只要他们自觉自愿的来谈，谈错了也没关系，不要有任何思想顾虑，也不要有任何勉强；能联系实际多谈一些当然是进步的表现，思想上有进步但是口头上少谈或不谈也不算落后，谈或不谈，多谈或少谈完全自觉自愿，任何人对别人皆不许有丝毫勉强。为了贯彻这一原则，学习办公室曾召集辅导员开了七、八次会，根据具体情况，反复说明这个原则，又在一些会上屡次向他们说明这个问题。
    三、在教学方面着重从正面讲解，以理服人，并结合形象化教育。对于他们的错误思想，主要以循循善诱的态度，着重从正面启发他们，从道理上来说服他们。如针对他们留恋过去的思想，一方面给他们讲了社会发展规律和必然的趋势，同时，更着重讲了社会主义的光明前途以及公私合营对国家和工商业者的好处，许多人经过学习后说：“这才绕过弯儿来了”，“觉得心里亮堂了，真如从云雾里钻出来了”，“闹了半天，原来搞公私合营还是和全国人民一道建设社会主义”。
    结合讲课内容，组织学员看电影，参观国营工厂、农业生产合作社和展览会等，效果很好。如他们看了电影董存瑞以后，普遍受到感动，许多人说：“自己的患得患失的个人主义思想和董存瑞比起来，实在太不对了”；看了电影“莫斯科在建设中”以后，许多人说：“走向这样幸福的社会主义，我还有什么顾虑呢”？
    四、通过各种生动活泼的形式来鼓舞学员的学习情绪。讲习班办公室编印了“学习小报”，公开报道学习情况，进行鼓励和表扬，两个多月以来，小报共收到学员投稿768篇，出刊20多期，许多学员感到小报对自己有“不少启发”，表示“要向学习好的学习”。各局和各专业公司的学习小组也在辅导员的具体指导下，展开了课余的集体活动，如出壁报、练工间操、搞集体游戏、学唱歌等，有的单位还举办了几次晚会，由学员自编快板、相声等节目演唱。这些集体活动深受他们的欢迎，打动了他们的心，使他们感到讲习班的学习生活温暖可亲。每天下午六点钟放学以后，还有些人留下聊天，自修或者给壁报写稿。
    五、政府各业务局、公司都重视他们的学习，并从生活上关心他们。各局除为他们准备了必要的学习条件外，还为他们购置了必需的学习用具，在学习期间，各局和各专业公司的负责同志又亲到学习小组去了解他们的学习情况。他们觉得领导上对他们的学习非常“关怀重视”，很受感动，表示“一定要安心学习好”。
    经过了上述措施和学习以后，使他们逐步认识到举办讲习班“完全是为了帮助工商业者进步”，感到“自己当初的想法实在可笑”，“十足表现了自己的资产阶级思想”。有的说：“共产党太好了，采用说服教育的办法，我们学着自然就起劲”。如有的学员入学以后，有两个星期一言未发，在循循善诱的正面教育启发的影响下，终于打消了种种疑惧和端正了不正确的想法，由沉默寡言一变而为小组学习的积极分子，结业的时候表示“来时不愿意来，现在我又不愿走了”。由于他们逐步解除了思想顾虑，学习积极性就愈来愈高，后来，他们一般都能联系实际说出比较真实的思想，小组讨论发言也比较踊跃自然。
    通过这期讲习班，使参加学习的绝大多数私方人员，减弱了他们对过去的留恋，增强了他们对未来的信心，减少了他们对社会主义的顾虑，从思想认识上奠定了“破资本主义，立社会主义”的初步基础。许多人在学习中说：“社会发展朝向社会主义，国家正走向社会主义，工商业者当然也必须走社会主义才有前途。”“一定要走旭日东升的社会主义道路，绝不走日落西山的资本主义道路。”有的人过去认为“共产党的政策到什么时候对我也不利，通过这次学习才认识到搞社会主义我也有前途”。许多人并检查了公私合营以后抱着“少和公股接近，少和工人谈话，少管闲事”，“唯公股之命是从，明知不对，也不提意见”的错误态度，表示“今后一定听党和政府的话，跟着共产党走，好好改造自己，做一个新工商业者，在社会主义建设事业中贡献出力量”。
    参加学习的私方人员从讲习班回到企业以后，一般在工作中都较学习以前大为积极主动，并且也敢于提意见了。公私合营电池厂资方技术副科长明广新过去工作不肯负责，有技术也不公开，和工人的关系也不好，现在他不但公开了制造常备牌电池的技术，而且，能经常深入车间指导改进制造蓄电池的工作，并且主动要求向工人作一次检讨。强声电影机厂资方技术股长陈金凯回去以后，针对该厂生产管理缺乏制度的情况，提出了生产前的准备、生产调度会议、生活卫生等三项工作制度。公股代表对他们这种积极的表现给予了支持，职工也认为他们“思想确实进了步”。
    从这一期讲习班的工作中，可以看出：一、举办工商界讲习班一定要和举办干部训练班有所不同，不能机械搬用干部训练班的教学方针和教学方法。不要强调理论必须联系实际，必须展开批评与自我批评；而要着重解除顾虑，强调启发他们的学习自觉性，发扬民主，自由辩论。二、必须抓紧政策思想的领导。政协全国委员会关于举办讲习班的方针和办法是正确的，但这一方针不是很容易就能够彻底贯彻下去的。因此必须反复教育所有和他们接触的干部，具体帮助干部深入领会办讲习班的政策精神。三、由于这是一件新的工作，缺乏经验，所以必须动员各有关方面的力量，不但要抽调一定数量较强的干部参加这一工作，各业务局也要密切配合和帮助。同时，更要充分发挥市工商联和民主建国会的作用，充分使用工商界的积极分子来作工作。
