Xinhua News Agency, August 8th—More than 300 young aviation enthusiasts from various places who participated in the "Aviation Enthusiasts Summer Camp," along with nearly 10,000 Beijing spectators, watched parachute, gliding, and aircraft aerobatics performances this morning in the rain.

The rain and strong winds created difficulties for the performances, but the athletes still performed seven of the ten scheduled events.

At a little past ten o'clock, after a green flare was launched into the air, the first event—the takeoff and landing performance of primary gliders—began. Then, two other gliders successively performed takeoff and landing routines.

The parachute performance began. The athletes participating in the performance were all members of the Central National Defense Sports Club's parachute team. Today, they were basically performing according to international competition rules. After jumping from the plane, the athletes were required to land within a circle with a diameter of 300 meters, and the closer to the center, the better. Due to the strong wind, they had to start jumping down far from the target.

A transport plane flew past, leaving five black dots in the sky. This was a collective precision landing parachute performance from a height of 800 meters. When the audience learned that the performers were five female athletes, they applauded. Then, five male athletes performed a collective precision landing parachute jump from a height of 800 meters.

Two primary trainer aircraft towed two advanced gliders to an altitude of over 800 meters. After the gliders detached from the aircraft, they began performing aerobatics such as spiral rotations and somersaults. A primary trainer aircraft then also participated in the aerobatics. All performances were then concluded.

    首都举行跳伞和滑翔表演
    据新华社8日讯　参加“航空爱好者夏令营”的三百多名各地的青年航空爱好者，今天上午同近一万名北京的观众，冒雨观看了跳伞、滑翔和飞机特技表演。
    阴雨和风大给表演带来了困难，但是运动员们仍然表演了预定的十个项目中的七个。
    十点多钟，当一颗绿色信号弹打到空中以后，第一个项目——初级滑翔机的起飞和降落表演开始了。接着另外两架滑翔机也陆续做了起飞和降落表演。
    跳伞表演开始了。参加表演的运动员都是中央国防体育俱乐部跳伞代表队的队员。他们今天基本上是按照国际比赛的规则进行表演的。运动员由飞机跳下以后，要求落在一个直径三百公尺的圆圈内，并且越接近圆心越好。由于风大，他们不得不在离目标很远的地方就开始往下跳。
    一架运输机飞过去了，天空中留下了五个黑点。这是八百公尺高度集体定点着陆跳伞表演。当观众知道参加表演的是五名女运动员的时候，鼓起掌来。接着五个男运动员表演了八百公尺高度集体定点着陆跳伞。
    两架初级教练机分别把两架高级滑翔机牵引到八百多公尺的空中以后，滑翔机脱离了飞机，开始表演螺形旋转和翻筋斗等特技。一架初级教练机随后也参加了特技表演。各项表演至此全部结束。
