Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th. The Southwest Geological Bureau has formally notified all field geological teams under its jurisdiction that, starting in August, it will abolish the restrictions on field workers bringing family members with them, and will allocate funds to build dormitories and establish rear bases for each field team.

In the past, the Southwest Geological Bureau emphasized frugality, and in order to reduce investment in housing construction and management costs, it imposed very strict restrictions on employees bringing family members. Generally, employees had to obtain prior approval from leadership to bring family members, and the average number of employees bringing family members in each exploration team was less than 10% of the total number of employees with families. As a result, many people could not see their loved ones for a long time, and some people had not returned home after working in the field for three or four years.

The new regulations stipulate that, except for apprentices who cannot bring family members for the time being, all other cadres and formal workers can bring their families to the work site. At the same time, it is stipulated that when employees transfer jobs, all moving expenses for family members can be borne by the public.

In order to solve the housing problem of each field team, the Southwest Geological Bureau has recently allocated 500,000 yuan to build dormitories for each field team. For employees who are currently renting civilian houses without dormitories, it has been decided that, starting in September, all rents will be borne by the public, and then sublet to employees at a low price.

In order to further improve the situation where field workers cannot see their loved ones for a long time, the Southwest Geological Bureau, with the approval of the Ministry of Geology, has also invested more than 12 million yuan to establish three rear bases for field teams in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces respectively. These rear bases include dormitories, nurseries, children's schools, sanatoriums, etc., with a planned total construction area of more than 230,000 square meters. After all these projects are completed, the family members of employees who cannot move with the field workers can settle down in the rear base and send their children to the children's school.

    规定合理制度，建立后方基地
    西南地质人员将与家人长期团聚
    新华社重庆25日电　西南地质局已经正式通知所属各野外地质队，从八月份起取消限制野外工作人员携带家属的规定，并且拨款为各野外队建筑宿舍和建立后方基地。
    西南地质局在过去因为强调节约，为了减少建筑住宅投资和管理费用，对职工携带家属限制很严。一般职工携带家属必须事先经过领导批准，各勘探队平均携带家属的职工不到有家属人数的10％。因此使许多人长期不能与自己的亲人见面，有的人在野外工作了三、四年还没回过家。
    新的规定除学徒工暂时还不能携带家属外，其余干部和正式工人都可携带家属到工地。并且同时规定职工在调动工作时，家属的搬迁费用可以全部由公家担负。
    为了解决各野外队的住房问题，西南地质局最近已经拨出资金五十万元，供给各野外队建筑宿舍。对现在还没有宿舍而租用民房的职工，决定从九月份起全部由公家包租，然后再廉价转租给职工居住。
    为了进一步改善野外工作人员长期不能与自己亲人见面的情况，西南地质局经地质部批准，还以一千二百多万元的投资在四川、云南、贵州三省分别建立三个野外队的后方基地。这些后方基地包括宿舍、托儿所、子弟学校、疗养院等，计划建筑的总面积达二十三万多平方公尺。这些工程全部建筑完工以后，不能随野外工作人员流动的职工家属就可以到后方基地安家，送自己的子女到子弟学校入学。
