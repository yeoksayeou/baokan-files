Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th - The water levels of most rivers in Heilongjiang Province have begun to decrease, but the water levels of the Songhua River mainstream and the lower reaches of the Nen River are still rising. The water level in the lower reaches of the Nen River has exceeded the highest historical water level. Now, on the embankments along the Songhua River and the lower reaches of the Nen River, thousands of flood control personnel are working day and night to raise and reinforce the dikes and to plug breaches. Residents of Harbin and Jiamusi, the main cities along the Songhua River, as well as Zhaodong, Zhaoyuan, Hulan, and Fujin counties, which are most threatened by floods, are fully engaged in the struggle to protect the dikes, fight against floods, and protect farmland.

During this flood season, more than 150,000 hectares of farmland in more than 30 counties across the province have suffered varying degrees of waterlogging. At present, agricultural producers' cooperatives in the affected areas are vigorously harvesting mature wheat and flax and draining water to save late-autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th - The flood peaks appearing on the Second Songhua River and the Nen River are successively approaching Harbin. At 4:00 PM on the 6th, the water level of the Songhua River near this largest city along the Songhua River had risen to 119.63 meters (this is the highest water level in more than twenty years, only twenty-odd centimeters lower than the highest water level during the great flood in Harbin in 1932), with the water surface being two meters above ground level, and the water level is still rising. According to the Harbin Flood Control Headquarters, the largest flood peak will arrive within forty-eight hours.

At 8:00 PM on the 5th, the flood had already overflowed the Xujia Dike in Hulan County, which is adjacent to Harbin, and submerged more than 5,000 hectares of land in the Songpu and Tianheng districts in the northern suburbs of Harbin City on the north bank of the Songhua River. Thanks to pre-emptive harvesting and rescue efforts, some of the ripe wheat and potatoes were saved from loss, and 23,000 residents and their livestock and furniture in the flooded areas have been relocated to safe areas. Sun Island, a summer resort in Songpu District, has been flooded, and all the people who were recuperating and vacationing there have been safely evacuated in advance. Now, under the slogan of "Ensuring both flood control and production," Harbin is ensuring the normal production and operation of industrial and commercial enterprises while mobilizing most of the staff of government agencies and organizations, and some citizens to rush to reinforce and raise the dikes day and night. The Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also specially dispatched a unit from other areas to provide support. The Vice-Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin, along with all the consulate staff, all the staff of the Soviet Commercial Office, and more than 140 Soviet experts working in Harbin have also actively participated in the flood control efforts.

The Central Flood Control Headquarters attaches great importance to and cares about the flood control work in Harbin. In addition to sending flood control experts to provide guidance, it has also transferred 100,000 gunny sacks, 210,000 grass sacks, and a large amount of timber from Dalian and Jilin Province to provide support.

    松花江干流和嫩江下游水位继续上涨
    哈尔滨水情告急全市紧张防汛
    据新华社哈尔滨6日电　黑龙江省境内多数河流水位开始下降，只有松花江干流和嫩江下游水位仍在上涨。嫩江下游的水位已超过了历史上最高水位。现在松花江和嫩江下游两岸的大堤上，日夜都有成千上万的防汛人员正在加高加固堤防，抢堵决口。松花江畔的主要城市哈尔滨和佳木斯市，以及受洪水威胁最大的县份肇东、肇源、呼兰、富锦等县居民，全力投入护堤抢险和保田的斗争。
    这次涨水中，全省共有三十多个县的十五万多公顷农田遭受了程度不同的内涝灾害。现在，受灾地区的农业生产合作社，正大力抢收成熟的小麦、亚麻和排水挽救大秋作物。
    据新华社哈尔滨6日电　在第二松花江和嫩江上出现的洪峰，相继逼近哈尔滨市。六日下午四时，这座松花江畔最大城市附近的松花江水位已经涨到119.63公尺（这是二十多年来未有的高水位，同历史上1932年哈尔滨大水灾时的最高水位相比只差二十多公分），水面高出地面两公尺，水势还在继续上涨中。据哈尔滨市防汛指挥部估计，最大的洪峰将在四十八小时内到达。
    在五日晚八时，洪水已经漫过了和哈尔滨毗邻的呼兰县徐家大堤，淹没了松花江北岸哈尔滨市郊松浦、天恒等三个区的五千多公顷土地。由于事先进行了抢收和抢救，一部分已成熟的小麦和土豆免除了损失，被淹地区的两万三千个居民和他们的家畜、家具都已经安置到安全的地区。松浦区境内的避暑地太阳岛已进了水，所有在此疗养、避暑的人们事先都已经安全地迁出。现在，哈尔滨市在“防汛生产两不误”的口号下，一面保证工商企业的照常生产和营业，一面动员机关、团体的大部分职工、部分市民不分昼夜上堤抢险和加高堤防。中国人民解放军沈阳军区还特地从外地调派了一支部队前来支援。苏联驻哈尔滨总领事馆副领事率全体馆员、苏联商务办事处全体人员以及在哈尔滨市工作的苏联专家等一百四十多人也积极地参加了防汛斗争。
    中央防汛总指挥部十分重视和关怀哈尔滨市的防汛工作，除派防汛专家前来指导外，并且从旅大市和吉林省调拨了麻袋十万条、草袋子二十一万条和大批木材来支援。
