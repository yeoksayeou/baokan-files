    Filling the "Milky Way" on Earth
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are separated by the Milky Way, only able to meet on the "Double Seventh Festival" once a year. This legend is well known.

    Recently, we have received a large number of letters from readers, stating that many couples are separated for long periods, unable to reunite for one, two, or even five or six years, as if separated by the Milky Way. All letters express the hope that this situation can be ended as soon as possible, allowing them to reunite.

    In the past, during the years of revolutionary war, it was common for couples to work in separate locations. At that time, for the sake of the revolution and the needs of the war, some comrades had to live such a life. However, the situation has now changed. We have moved from the war period to the construction period. Therefore, these types of problems should be resolved as much as possible. Of course, the current situation of couples working in separate locations is still relatively complex. Some cases are indeed due to work needs and limited conditions, making it impossible to resolve temporarily. For example, some areas are just beginning construction, and due to objective difficulties, couples cannot work together. In this case, it can be clearly explained to the cadres. However, judging from the information reflected in the letters, the vast majority of cases could be taken care of but have not been, resulting in couples being separated for a long time. Why can't these issues be addressed when they could be? Why are resolutions delayed indefinitely when they could be made sooner? This is the crux of the problem.

    Recently, the Ministry of Education notified local education administrative departments that they should try their best to accommodate teachers who request to have their spouses transferred to work in the same location. Since the education department can start to solve this problem, why can't other departments find ways to solve it as well? Upon analysis, the main reasons are as follows:

    First, "work requires it, and relocation is not possible." Every revolutionary cadre knows to obey the needs of their work. Initially, many couples separated precisely to meet the needs of their work. As time progresses, and as work conditions and cadre situations change, some regions and departments may now be able to resolve the issue of couples working together. However, some leading cadres and personnel departments have not considered these changes and simply use the shield of "work requires it" to reject all requests. A cadre in a work position will always be needed for work. If personal needs can be appropriately accommodated under the conditions of work needs, wouldn't that be better? Moreover, in the case of couples, the situation of work needs may vary. Here, we can make a comparison: If work requires the husband to stay in his original position, the wife can be transferred to the husband's location; if work requires the wife to stay in her original position, the husband can be transferred to the wife's location. If both husband and wife are highly needed for their work, the priorities can be weighed, considered comprehensively, and while there may be some losses in one aspect, there can be compensation in another. As for the work they leave behind, other cadres can be assigned to replace them. How can it be said that "work requires it, and relocation is not possible"? Because couples are separated for a long time, some people's lives are not only affected, but their work is sometimes also affected. Even from the perspective of work, this issue should now be addressed.

    Second, "this is a personal matter, and the organization cannot resolve it." Indeed, all requests for couples to be transferred to work together are personal matters. The problem is: since this "personal matter" relates to the cadre's personal life and directly affects their work, we should pay full attention to and care for it. Currently, all working couples belong to a specific organization. If the organization does not help these "individuals" solve these "private matters," then who will initiate the transfer, the husband or the wife? Relying solely on "individuals," who can solve these "private matters" themselves? Therefore, although it is a "personal matter," the organization should help resolve it as much as possible. When watching the "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," people sympathize with their plight. Therefore, we should be even more concerned about the problem of couple separation in real life. We cannot eliminate the Milky Way in the sky, but we have ways to fill the "Milky Way" on earth.

    Third, "different systems, numerous difficulties." Among these separated couples, there are many cases of different systems. For example, the husband works in the industrial system in Location A, and the wife works in the education system in Location B. This is a case of different systems. In this case, there will be special obstacles to transferring the couple to work together. It should be fully acknowledged that due to different systems, arranging work brings great inconvenience. However, this inconvenience is not an insurmountable difficulty, and from a long-term perspective, these difficulties must be overcome. Because, in any case, many married cadres cannot be left to live a single life forever. With the development of the national construction cause, various tasks are also developing. The number of cadres needed to take on various business tasks in a region is gradually increasing, which creates conditions for couples from different systems to work together. As long as leaders in various systems can pay attention to this issue and make necessary adjustments based on different conditions, the phenomenon of separation can be reduced, bringing family happiness to many couples.

    Twenty-two years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All practical life problems of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." Twenty-two years have passed, and these words still have great practical significance for us. From the leadership's point of view, cadres are also part of the masses, and caring about their lives is an inescapable responsibility.

    填平地上的“天河”
    本报评论员
    牛郎织女相隔在天河的两边，只有期待一年一度的“七夕”相会。这个传说是人所共知的。
    最近以来，我们收到大批的读者来信，说明有许多夫妇长期分隔在两地，一年两年以至五、六年不能团聚，如同天河阻隔一样。所有来信都希望能尽快地结束这种状态，让他们团聚在一起。
    过去，在革命战争的年代里，夫妇双方分隔在两个地方工作是常有的事。当时，为了革命的利益，为了战争的需要，不得不使一些同志过这样的生活。但是，现在情况变了，我们由战争时期转入了建设时期，因此，对现在的这一类问题，应当尽可能地设法解决。当然，现在的夫妇分隔两地工作的情况，也还比较复杂。有的确实是因为工作需要、条件限制，暂时还无法解决。比如，有些地区现在刚刚开始建设，由于客观困难的限制，不能使夫妇双方在一起工作。在这种情况下，完全可以向干部解释清楚。但从来信反映的情况看，绝大多数都是可以照顾而没有照顾，以致造成夫妇长久分离的状态。为什么能够照顾而又不予照顾呢？为什么可以早些解决而拖得遥遥无期呢？这就是问题的所在了。
    最近，教育部通知各地教育行政部门，对教师中要求夫妇调在一地工作的问题，应尽可能予以照顾，将他们调在一起。既然教育部门可以着手解决这个问题，其他部门为什么不可以设法解决呢？如果分析一下，最主要的原因有以下这样几点。
    首先是，“工作需要，不能调离”。一个革命干部，谁都知道服从工作需要。开始时，许多夫妇正是为着服从工作需要而分离的。随着时间的进展，随着工作条件和干部情况的变化，有的地区和部门，已经有可能来解决夫妇双方在一起工作的问题。可是，有些领导干部和人事部门却没有考虑到这些变化，只简单地用“工作需要”这面盾牌挡回了一切人的请求。一个在工作岗位上的干部，永远是工作需要的。如果，能够在工作需要的条件下，适当照顾一下个人需要，不是更好一些吗？而且，就夫妇两人说来，工作需要的情况也会有些不同。这里，可以比较一下：工作需要男方留在原岗位，可以将女方调到男方去；工作需要女方留在原岗位，也可以将男方调到女方去。如果男女双方工作都很需要，也可以权衡轻重，从全面来考虑，从这一方面有点损失，从另一方面还可以得到补偿。至于他们遗留下的工作，完全可以调派其他干部来代替，怎会因为“工作需要，不能调离”呢？由于夫妇双方长期隔离，有的人不仅生活受影响，甚至在工作上有时也受到影响。即使从工作出发，现在也应当正视这个问题了。
    其次是，“这是个人私事，组织无法解决”。确实，所有要求夫妇双方调在一起工作的问题，都是个人私事。问题是：这种“个人私事”既然关系到干部的切身生活而且直接影响到工作，我们就应当充分地注意和关怀。现在，一切参加工作的夫妇都属于一定的组织。假使组织上不去帮助这些“个人”解决这些“私事”，那么，他们是夫调动妇呢？还是妇调动夫呢？单凭“个人”，谁又能够自己解决这些“私事”呢？所以，虽然是“个人私事”，组织上也应尽可能地帮助解决。看“天河配”时，人们同情“牛郎织女”的遭遇。因此，更应当关切现实生活中夫妇隔离的问题。我们不可能取消天上的天河，但我们有办法填平地上的“天河”。
    再次是，“系统不同，困难重重”。在这些分离的夫妇中，系统不同的情况很多。比如，丈夫在甲地工业系统工作，妻子在乙地教育系统工作，这就是系统不同。在这种情况下，要将夫妇双方调在一起工作，就会遇到特别的障碍。完全应当承认，由于系统不同，给安排工作带来了很大的不便。但是，这种不便并不是不可克服的困难，而且从长远方面来考虑，也必须克服这些困难。因为，无论如何，总不能使很多已经结婚的干部永远过独身生活。随着国家建设事业的发展，各项工作也在发展，在一个地区里，需要担任各种业务工作的干部逐渐增多，这就为系统不同的夫妇在一起工作创造了条件。只要各个系统领导上能够注意到这个问题，根据不同条件，进行必要的调整，就会减少两地隔绝的现象，给许多夫妇带来了家庭幸福。
    二十二年以前，毛泽东同志曾经说过：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”二十二年过去了，这些话对我们仍有巨大的现实意义。在领导上说来，干部也是群众，关心他们的生活，这是义不容辞的责任。
