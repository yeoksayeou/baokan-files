    Criticizing Erroneous Claims About the History of the Great Patriotic War

    The tenth issue of the Soviet magazine "Communist" this year published an article titled "Studying the History of the Great Patriotic War More Profoundly," written by Yevsigneev, Sulin, and Rodinsky.

    This article criticizes the conflicting evaluations that have appeared in the Soviet press regarding the elucidation of the initial stage of the Great Patriotic War, namely disagreeing with the claim that there was no active defense in the early stages of the war, etc. The authors point out that doing so only causes confusion and bewilderment among readers. For example, the editorial in the "Red Star" newspaper on May 9th of this year incorrectly criticized the editorial of the "Military Herald" magazine (fourth issue of this year). That was a fundamentally correct article clarifying the Great Patriotic War. The editorial analyzed some of the reasons for the initial defeats of the Soviet army (such as inadequate preparation of the Soviet army, dispersed actions of individual corps, etc.). "Red Star" said that the article was incorrect and harmful. However, "Red Star" itself did not answer the reasons why the Soviet army had to retreat to the rear; it did not clarify the entire complexity of the situation at that time.

    The authors believe that one of the reasons for the Soviet army's failures in the initial stage of the war was that "our army did not have the experience of large-scale modern warfare, and its forces were not fully mobilized, while the fascist army had this experience and had mobilized early and concentrated on the Soviet border." In addition, the Soviet military industry did not have sufficient means to quickly replenish the massive losses of military equipment. This was inevitable in modern large-scale warfare. The reason for this was that we had serious negligence in the planning of the development of military industry in the pre-war years.

    Another reason for the serious setbacks suffered by the Soviet army in the initial stage of the war was Stalin's obvious miscalculation of the military-strategic situation that had formed on the eve of the war. Stalin regarded the facts proving that Fascist Germany was preparing to attack the Soviet Union as untrue, believing that these facts had the provocative nature of sharpening Soviet-German relations and causing conflict. Stalin's starting point was the unfounded belief that Fascist Germany would not tear up the non-aggression pact. Therefore, a week before the outbreak of the war, a TASS communiqué was issued refuting the claims appearing in foreign newspapers about the increasingly imminent Soviet-German war. The publication of such a communiqué when the war was imminent could only paralyze the Soviet people and relax the vigilance of our people and army.

    The authors finally pointed out that it is necessary to seriously study the history of the Great Patriotic War. (Hu Sisheng)

### 批判对卫国战争历史的错误说法

    批判对卫国战争历史的错误说法
    今年第十期苏联“共产党人”杂志发表了以“更深刻地研究伟大卫国战争历史”为题的专论，作者是叶夫斯基格涅夫，穗林和罗金斯基。
    这篇文章批评了在苏联报刊上出现的对阐明卫国战争开始阶段的相反的估价，即不同意说战争初期没有积极防卫等等。作者指出，这样做只会造成读者的混乱和困惑。例如今年五月九日的“红星报”编辑部专论就不正确地批评了“军事信使”杂志（今年第四期）的社论。那是一篇基本上是正确的阐明卫国战争的文章。这篇社论分析了卫国战争初期失败的一些原因（如苏军准备不足，个别军团的行动分散等等）。“红星报”说那篇文章是不正确的、有害的。但是，“红星报”本身却没有回答为什么苏军不得不往后方撤退的原因；没有说清当时局势的整个复杂性。
    作者认为，苏军在战争开始阶段的失利的一个原因是：“我们的军队没有大规模现代化作战的经验，力量没有充分动员起来，而法西斯军队却拥有这种经验并且很早就动员起来集中在苏联边境。”除此之外，苏联的军事工业没有充分的办法去迅速补充军事装备的大量损失。这本来是在现代化大规模作战中不可避免的事。其所以如此，是因为战前年代我们在发展军事工业的计划上有严重的疏忽。
    苏军在战争开始阶段遭到严重失利的另一个原因是斯大林对战争爆发前夕形成的军事战略局势估价上的明显失算。斯大林把证明法西斯德国准备进攻苏联的事实看做是不符事实的，认为这些事实具有使苏德关系尖锐化和引起冲突的挑衅性质。斯大林的出发点是没有根据地认为法西斯德国不会撕毁互不侵犯条约。因此，在战争爆发前一个星期，还出现了塔斯社的公报，驳斥在外国报刊上出现的有关苏德战争日益迫近的说法。这样的公报在战争迫在眉睫的情况下发表，只能麻痹苏联人民，松懈我们人民和军队的警惕性。
    作者最后指出，必须认真研究卫国战争历史。（胡思升）
