Helping Cooperative Members Raise Pigs Benefits Both Public and Private Interests
    Tian Fengyun
    The Dongtang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Donghu Township, Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, attaches great importance to the household sideline production of its members. Cooperative cadres have devised many ways to help members raise pigs. From the establishment of the cooperative in February of this year to the end of June, the number of live pigs raised by the 501 member households in the cooperative increased from 280 to 729. This does not include the 114 pigs weighing over 100 jin that have already been sold to the state. Originally, only 36% of the more than 500 member households raised pigs, but now the number of pig-raising households has increased to 61%. In the future, the entire cooperative can sell 29 pigs weighing over 100 jin to the state each month, accumulate 656 dan of pig manure, and 5,460 dan of pig urine. The total annual accumulation of pig manure and urine can reach more than 73,000 dan. Assuming 70 dan of fertilizer per mu of paddy field, the fertilization problem for 40% of the cooperative's paddy fields will be solved.
    Originally, cooperative members had many concerns about raising pigs, the first being the fear that raising pigs would take a lot of effort and yield little benefit. In response to this concern, cooperative cadres educated members with the facts of how farmers in the township benefited from raising pigs. Old Mrs. Chen from the township raises pigs every year, selling two large ones and buying two small ones. In the past five years, she has sold a total of ten large pigs weighing 160-170 jin. Mrs. Chen wanted to build a house, so she sold pigs to buy wood. By December of last year, her family's new six-room house was built. It cost a total of 200 dan of grain, two-thirds of which came from raising pigs. In March of this year, Mrs. Chen increased her pig farming from two to four pigs, planning to sell four large ones and buy four small ones each year. The total income from selling pigs and pig manure and urine is more than 200 yuan per year. After the story of Mrs. Chen raising pigs and building a house was widely publicized to the members, everyone became very interested in raising pigs. In addition, the cooperative also stipulated reasonable prices for the purchase of pig manure and urine, and members can get cash at any time by selling manure and urine to the cooperative. The members are very satisfied and are willing to raise pigs.
    Raising pigs is good, but what if there is no capital? In addition to mobilizing members to find ways to solve the problem themselves, the cooperative allocated more than 500 yuan from its sideline income, borrowed 500 yuan from the credit cooperative, and allocated a portion of the early rice pre-purchase deposit to members to buy pigs. The capital problem was solved.
    With more pigs being raised, what about the difficulty of feed? The cooperative cadres specially invited Wu Yuchun, an old member who has been raising pigs for many years, to introduce his experience in collecting wild green fodder at the members' meeting. According to his experience, water hyacinth, duckweed, river heart grass, etc. are all good pig feeds and grow abundantly in paddy fields and lakes everywhere; dozens of kinds of wild vegetables and grasses grown on the mountains are also good feeds. After this introduction, everyone realized that there are many sources of feed. Now, dozens of members in the cooperative use their spare time every day to pick wild vegetables and grasses. Many members also take advantage of the season when green fodder grows luxuriantly to pick more, ensile it, or dry it for winter and spring feed.
    One of the biggest concerns of members raising pigs is the occurrence of swine fever. The cooperative has also paid attention to this issue. The cadres led the members to carry out sanitation and epidemic prevention work, and mobilized the members to repair pig pens. They adopted the method of "private repair, public assistance" to repair pig pens. In the past three months, 290 pig pens have been repaired, and more than 60 are under construction. The pig pens are cleaned every day, and the manure is removed every day. In June, all pigs, large and small, in the cooperative were vaccinated. Before the vaccination, some pigs had died in the cooperative, but none have died since the vaccination.
    While leading members to develop household pig farming, the cooperative's collective pig farming has also developed. Now, the cooperative collectively raises 52 pigs, and plans to increase this number to 200 by the end of the year. In order to solve the problem of the difficulty in obtaining piglets, the cooperative plans to collectively raise some sows to supply the needs of the cooperative and its members for raising pigs.

    帮助社员养猪公私两利
    田凤云
    福建省连江县东湖乡东塘农业生产合作社很重视社员家庭副业生产，社干部想了很多办法帮助社员养猪。从今年二月建社到六月底，全社五百零一户社员养的毛猪从二百八十头增加到七百二十九头，已卖给国家百斤以上的毛猪一百十四头还不计算在内。原来五百多户社员中，只有36％的社员户养猪，现在养猪的社员户已增加到61％。今后全社每月可以卖给国家上百斤的毛猪二十九头，积猪粪六百五十六担，猪尿五千四百六十担。合计全年可积猪粪尿七万三千多担。每亩稻田施肥按七十担计算，全社40％稻田的施肥问题解决了。
    原来，社员对养猪有很多顾虑，首先是怕养猪花很多工夫，得不到多少好处。针对这个顾虑，合作社干部用本乡农民养猪得利的事实教育社员。本乡陈老太太，年年养猪，每年卖两头大的，买两头小的。近五年共卖十头一百六、七十斤的大猪。陈老太太要盖房子，卖了猪就买木料。到去年十二月，她家一座六间的新房子盖起来了。共花谷子二百担，其中三分之二是养猪得来的。今年三月陈老太太养猪由二头发展到四头，计划每年卖四头大的，买四头小的。合计卖猪和猪粪尿的收入每年就有二百多元。陈老太太养猪盖房子的事向社员普遍宣传以后，大家对养猪的事很感兴趣。此外，合作社又规定收买猪粪尿的合理价格，并且随时卖粪尿给社里可以随时得现钱。社员很满意，都愿意养猪了。
    养猪虽好，没有资金怎么办呢？合作社除了发动社员自己尽量想办法以外，从社里的副业收入拨出五百多元、向信用社贷款五百元，又拨出一部分早稻预购定金支给社员买猪。资金的问题解决了。
    猪养得多了，饲料发生了困难，怎么办呢？社干部特别请养猪多年的老社员吴玉春在社员大会上介绍他搜集野生青饲料的经验。据他的经验，水镜、浮萍、河心草等都是养猪的好饲料，在各地稻田和湖泊中大量生长着；山上生的几十种野菜野草。也是好饲料。这一介绍，大家才知道饲料来源很多。现在，全社每天有几十个社员利用劳动空隙时间采摘野菜野草。许多社员还趁青绿饲料生长茂盛的季节多多采摘，青贮起来或晒干，准备作冬春饲料。
    社员养猪最担心的一个问题是发生猪瘟。合作社也注意到了这个问题。干部领导社员开展了卫生防疫工作，并发动社员修猪栏。他们采取“私修、公助”的办法修猪栏。近三个月来已修好猪栏二百九十个。还有六十多个正在修建。猪栏每天打扫，粪便每天清除。六月间，全社所有大小猪都进行了防疫注射。注射前全社曾死了一些猪，注射以后一头也没有死的。
    在领导社员发展家庭养猪业的同时，合作社的集体养猪业也发展了。现在社里集体养的猪已有五十二头，计划到年底要发展到二百头。为了解决仔猪来源困难的问题，社里准备集体养些母猪，供给社和社员养猪的需要。
