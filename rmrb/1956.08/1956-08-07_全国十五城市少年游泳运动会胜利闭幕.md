    National Fifteen-City
    Youth Swimming Competition Successfully Concludes

    (Our Dispatch) The 1956 National Fifteen-City Youth Swimming Competition, held in Beijing, successfully concluded on the 6th after thirty-four preliminary and final events.

    The women's youth B group 200-meter freestyle relay final was the most intense competition on the 6th. At the start of the race, the Tianjin team took the lead, but by the second swimmer, the Shanghai team jumped from fourth place to first, and the Guangzhou team chased from fifth place to second. In the end, the Shanghai team won with a time of two minutes and forty-one point six seconds. Following were Guangzhou, Nanning, Xiamen, Tianjin, and Beijing in that order. In the men's youth A group 100-meter freestyle final, Mu Xiangjie of the Tianjin team won first place with an excellent time of one minute and three point five seconds. The other young athletes lagged far behind him by more than ten meters.

    Mu Chengkuan, a senior figure in China's swimming circles, told reporters at the swimming pool on the 6th that the average time of around thirty seconds in the fifty-meter event achieved by the young athletes in this competition is truly remarkable. From this, it can be seen that these children have a very good future ahead of them. The competition also revealed some technical shortcomings in the athletes. Through this competition, and after the summaries of each team, the swimming skills of these children will rapidly improve in the right direction. Finally, Mu Chengkuan said: "With this group of successors, China's swimming movement will soon catch up with and surpass international standards."

    全国十五城市
    少年游泳运动会胜利闭幕
    本报讯　在北京举行的1956年全国十五城市少年游泳运动会六日经过三十四项预决赛后胜利闭幕。
    在六日的比赛中，以女子少年乙组二百公尺自由泳接力决赛最为紧张。比赛开始第一人是天津队领先，但到第二人时上海队从第四位跃居首位，广州队从第五位追至第二位，最后上海队以二分四十一秒六的成绩取胜，以下依序是广州、南宁、厦门、天津、北京。男子少年甲组百公尺自由泳决赛天津队穆祥杰以一分三秒五的优异成绩获得第一名。其他少年运动员远远落在他后面十公尺以外。
    我国游泳界前辈穆成宽六日在游泳馆对记者说，少年运动员这次比赛五十公尺成绩平均在三十秒左右，实在是件不平常的事情，从这一点就可以看出这些孩子们将来会有很好的发展前途。这次比赛中也发现运动员技术上的一些缺点。通过这次比赛，经过各队的总结，这些孩子的游泳技术也就会顺着正确方向迅速提高。最后穆成宽说：“有了这批接班人，将来我国游泳运动会很快赶上并超过国际水平。”
