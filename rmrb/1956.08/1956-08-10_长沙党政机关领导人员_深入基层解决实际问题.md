Leading Cadres of Changsha Party and Government Organs
    Go Deep into Grassroots to Solve Practical Problems

    (Our report) At the First Congress of the Communist Party of China Changsha Municipal Committee held in May, the representatives raised sharp criticisms of the bureaucratic leadership style of the responsible Party member cadres of various departments and bureaus for not going deep among the masses and into the grassroots. The congress instructed the Municipal Committee to organize and urge the responsible comrades of various departments and bureaus to go deep down, change their style, and improve their work in a planned way.

    In the two months after the congress closed, under the leadership of the CPC Changsha Municipal Committee, the responsible Party member cadres of various departments earnestly implemented the resolutions of the congress, and most of the responsible comrades went deep into grassroots units to discover and solve problems. The responsible Party member comrades of the Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department, the Municipal People's Committee's Industry Bureau, and other units have recently organized more than 30 people to go to six factories to assist in solving important issues such as completing the third quarter production plan, preventing heatstroke and lowering temperature, and carrying out the advanced producer movement. Most of the responsible persons of the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee have been stationed in the factories. The Handicraft Industry Bureau originally believed that the wok production cooperative needed to change from centralized production to decentralized operation, but after in-depth understanding, it was found that centralized production did not reduce the income of the cooperative members, and the cooperative members were unwilling to decentralize the operation. Therefore, the leadership cancelled the original opinion. After the leaders of the Grain Bureau went deep into the staff dormitory, they found that some employees still had serious difficulties in their lives. They immediately instructed the subordinate units to use all the unused welfare funds for the life of the employees. (Hu Xuehua)

    长沙党政机关领导人员
    深入基层解决实际问题
    本报讯　在五月份举行的中共长沙市第一次代表大会上，代表们对各部、局的党员负责干部不深入群众和基层的官僚主义的领导作风，提出了尖锐的批评。大会并责成市委会要有计划地组织和督促各部、局的负责同志深入下去，转变作风，改进工作。
    大会闭幕后的两个月内，在中共长沙市委的领导下，各部门党员负责干部认真执行大会的决议，负责同志大部分都深入到基层单位，发现和解决问题。市委工业部、市人民委员会工业局等单位的党员负责同志，最近已组织三十多人，分别到六个工厂去协助解决完成第三季度生产计划、防暑降温、开展先进生产者运动等重要问题。市委工业部的多数负责人已驻到工厂里去。手工业局原来认为鏳锅生产合作社需要变集中生产为分散经营，但经过深入了解，发现集中生产并没有减少社员收入，社员也不愿分散经营，于是领导上就取消了原来的意见，粮食局领导人员深入职工宿舍后，发现有的职工生活上还有严重的困难，他们立即指示所属单位把没有用完的福利金全部用到职工生活上去。　（胡雪华）
