The Three Soviet Republics on the Baltic Coast

The Soviet Union has a total of fifteen union republics (originally sixteen, but on July 16th of this year, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, based on the request of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, passed a resolution to transform this union republic into an autonomous republic and incorporate it into the Russian Federation, so now there are fifteen). Among them, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are three republics located on the Baltic coast in the northwest border region. This August marks the sixteenth anniversary of these three republics joining the Soviet Union.

Lithuania is located at the southern end of the Baltic coast, with an area of 65,200 square kilometers and a population of about 3 million. The capital is Vilnius. Latvia is located where the Gulf of Riga deeply penetrates inland on the Baltic coast, with an area of 64,500 square kilometers and a population of about 2 million. The capital is Riga. Estonia is located in the middle of the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga, with an area of 45,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1 million. The capital is Tallinn.

For two hundred years, the Baltic coast has been an inseparable part of Russia. It is the only way for the central regions of the Soviet Union to reach Western Europe. Most of Russia's imports and exports by sea pass through the Baltic ports of Tallinn, Riga, Ventspils, Liepāja, and Klaipėda. Countless economic ties closely intertwine them, and the struggles of the working people of the Baltic coast with the entire Russian working class and peasants against the rule of the Tsar and the exploitation of landlords and capitalists further strengthen their fraternal relationship. As a result of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the people of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia established Soviet power. However, during the civil war, the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, with the support of international counter-revolutionary united forces and German armed forces, overthrew the Soviet power and restored the capitalist system. It was not until June and July 1940 that the working people of the Baltic countries, under the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrew the bourgeois governments, declared themselves Soviet Socialist Republics, and requested the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to allow them to join the Soviet Union. This request was approved on August 3 (Lithuania), 5 (Latvia), and 6 (Estonia), 1940.

However, these three young Soviet republics were soon subjected to the invasion and destruction of the Hitler bandit army, which brought them terrible disasters. It was not until early 1945, with the assistance of the heroic Soviet army, that they were liberated and embarked on the road of building a communist society again.

In the post-war period, the people of the three Baltic republics, with the fraternal assistance of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, successfully completed the Fourth Five-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the national economy, which was also the first Five-Year Plan for these three young Soviet republics. On this basis, they successfully completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union by 1955. During the five years, the industrial level of Lithuania increased 1.6 times, nearly four times more than before the Soviet era (1940); Latvia's industry generally increased by 90%, the output value of heavy industry doubled, while machinery manufacturing increased by 1.7 times, and electricity production increased by more than 90%; Estonia's industrial output doubled, 5.7 times more than before the war. In agriculture, these three republics have transformed from agricultural countries with small-scale peasant economies into socialist industrial and agricultural countries with collectivization and mechanization. Collective farms have been greatly consolidated, and the tasks of selling and delivering grain and other agricultural products to the state have been greatly overfulfilled every year. There has also been great development in the mechanization of agricultural labor. Extensive development has also been achieved in cultural construction.

It has been exactly sixteen years since the three Baltic republics became equal union republics of the powerful Soviet Union and members of the united family of all fraternal nationalities. No force in the world can separate the people of these countries from the Soviet Union, and all ambitious people coveting the ports and islands of the Baltic coast are bound to be disappointed forever. Now, the people of the three republics, full of confidence, are working together with all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union to complete and overfulfill the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

### 波罗的海沿岸的三个苏维埃共和国

    波罗的海沿岸的三个苏维埃共和国
    苏联一共有十五个加盟共和国（原来是十六个“今年七月十六日苏联最高苏维埃会议根据卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国最高苏维埃的请求，通过决议把这个加盟共和国改成自治共和国，加入俄罗斯联邦，所以现在是十五个），其中立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚这三个共和国在西北边疆的波罗的海海岸上。今年八月是这三个共和国加入苏联的十六周年纪念日。
    立陶宛在波罗的海沿岸地区的南端，面积有六万五千二百平方公里，人口约三百余万人。首都是维尔纽斯。拉脱维亚在波罗的海沿岸里加湾深入陆地的地方，面积有六万四千五百平方公里，人口约二百万人。首都是里加。爱沙尼亚在芬兰湾和里加湾的中间，面积有四万五千平方公里，人口约一百多万人。首都是塔林。
    二百年来波罗的海沿岸一直都是俄国不可分离的一部分。这里是苏联中央区各州通往西欧的必经之路，大部分俄罗斯由海路进出口的物资都经过波罗的海的港口——塔林、里加、温次匹尔斯、里巴雅和克来伯达。千丝万缕的经济关系把它们紧密地交织在一起，而波罗的海沿岸劳动人民同整个俄国工人阶级和农民们为反对沙皇统治和地主、资本家剥削所进行的斗争，更把他们兄弟般的关系加强起来。伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的结果，立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚的人民建立了苏维埃政权。但是，在内战时期，反革命的资产阶级在国际反革命联合势力和德国武装力量的支持下，推翻了苏维埃政权，恢复了资本主义制度。直到1940年6、7月间，波罗的海沿岸各国劳动人民在共产党领导下推翻了资产阶级政府，宣布为苏维埃社会主义共和国，并请求苏联最高苏维埃准许它们加入苏联。这个请求在1940年8月3日（立陶宛）、5日（拉脱维亚）、6日（爱沙尼亚）被批准了。
    可是，这三个年轻的苏维埃共和国诞生不久，就遭到了希特勒匪军的进犯和破坏，给它们带来了可怕的灾难。1945年初，在英勇的苏军援助下它们才获得了解放，从新走上建设共产主义社会的道路。
    战后时期，波罗的海沿岸三个共和国的人民，在苏联各族人民兄弟般的援助下，胜利地完成了恢复和发展国民经济的第四个五年计划，也就是这三个年轻的苏维埃共和国第一个五年计划。在这个基础上，到1955年又胜利完成了苏联发展国民经济的第五个五年计划。在五年期间，立陶宛的工业水平增加了一点六倍，比苏维埃时期（1940年）以前差不多增加了四倍；拉脱维亚的工业一般增长90％，重工业方面的生产额增加了一倍，而机器制造业增加了一点七倍，电力生产增加了90％多；爱沙尼亚的工业产量增加了一倍，比战前增加了五点七倍。在农业方面，这三个共和国已经从小农经济的农业国变成了集体化、机械化的社会主义的工业和农业国了。集体农庄大大地巩固了，每年都大大超额完成向国家交售和交纳谷物和其他农产品的任务。在农业劳动机械化方面也都有很大的发展。文化建设方面也获得了广泛的发展。
    波罗的海沿岸三个共和国成为强大的苏联的一个平等的加盟共和国和各兄弟民族团结的大家庭中的一员，已经整整十六年了。世界上没有任何力量能够使这些国家的人民同苏联分开，一切垂涎波罗的海沿岸的港口和岛屿的野心家必然永远失望。现在，三个共和国的人民，正满怀信心地同苏联各族人民一起，为完成和超额完成第六个五年计划而努力。　（章）
