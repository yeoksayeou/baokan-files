Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 28th: The garrison and public security organs of Haiyang County, Shandong Province, with the assistance of the masses, recently captured two groups of American-sent special agents along the coast. These two groups of special agents were dispatched by American intelligence agencies from South Korea in May and June of this year, landing on the Chinese mainland from the Jiaodong coast. The public security organs have now completed the investigation and interrogation of this case and will soon transfer it to the national procuratorial organs for review and prosecution.

There were a total of six special agents in these two groups. The interrogation confirmed that the intention of these American special agents in landing on the mainland was to collect various types of intelligence about our country and to collect various documents in order for American intelligence agencies to send more special agents to our country to carry out sabotage activities.

The first group of special agents dispatched by the American intelligence agency, Li Tianqing, Wu Bojun, and Yuan Amu, were personally escorted by an American Army Captain Raymond to a solitary island on the night of May 9th, and then landed at Caodaozui, Dongjia Village, Haiyang County, Shandong Province. The morning after they landed, they were discovered by local young women Xin Qingyun, young girl Dong Renfen, and Zhang Peihua. Xin Qingyun and others immediately reported to the local garrison. Upon hearing the news, the local garrison and public security organs immediately conducted a search and encirclement. The special agents Li Tianqing and Yuan Amu were captured on the spot; the special agent Wu Bojun resisted arrest with gunfire and was wounded by us. He was captured alive but died due to his injuries. All kinds of communication equipment, special agent cameras, silenced pistols, and a large number of gold bars, watches, and Renminbi carried by this group of special agents were seized.

The investigation confirmed that in January 1955, Li Tianqing and the other two were recruited from Chiang Kai-shek's army by the "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" of the special agent organization. After being trained at the "Southern Training Class" in Dazhi, a suburb of Taipei City, jointly run by American and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations, they were sent to Okinawa, Japan, by the American intelligence agency "Central Intelligence Agency" in April of the same year for specialized agent training. Later, they were sent to Daizu Island near Incheon, South Korea. There, American Army Captain Raymond led them in landing operations. From November 1955 to March of this year, this group of special agents, under the command of the Tokyo spy organization of the American intelligence agency "Central Intelligence Agency," attempted to land in Northeast China and Shandong five times, but all failed due to unfavorable weather or our strict coastal defense. Later, under the direct dispatch of American special agents, they landed in Dongjia Village, Haiyang County, Shandong Province on the night of May 9th this year. This group of special agents was captured after spending one night in the open.

According to the confession of the captured special agents, the task they received from the American intelligence agency this time was to: collect various military, political, and economic intelligence about our country; collect various documents such as migration certificates and membership cards, and understand the procedures for handling these documents, so that the American intelligence agency could continuously send more special agents and spies to our mainland to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities.

The second group of American special agents who landed was Zheng Yunhai and the other two. They were escorted by a speedboat of the American intelligence agency and landed at the same location where the special agents Li Tianqing and others landed on the night of June 5th. Their mission was to take back the first group of three special agents who had been dispatched. However, they did not achieve their purpose. Under the encirclement and suppression of the local garrison, one was captured alive, one was shot dead on the spot, and one drowned at sea. All the weapons and materials they carried were seized.

In cracking this special agent case, the three local women, Xin Qingyun, young girl Dong Renfen, and Zhang Peihua, showed a high degree of vigilance and made contributions to solving the case. In order to commend their patriotic behavior, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued a special order to commend them and awarded them a bonus of one thousand yuan. (Photo attached)

    山东海阳县驻军和公安机关在群众协助下
    捕获美国派遣的两批特务
    新华社济南28日电　山东省海阳县驻军和公安机关在群众协助下，最近在沿海捕获了两批美国派遣特务。这两批特务是美国间谍机关在今年5、6两月从南朝鲜派遣由胶东沿海登上我国大陆的。现在公安机关已对这个案件侦讯完毕，即将移送国家检察机关审查和提起公诉。
    这两批特务分子共六人。侦讯中证实这些美国特务分子登上大陆的企图是搜集我国各种情报并搜集各种证件，以便美国特务机关派遣更多的特务来我国进行破坏活动。
    第一批被美国特务机关派遣的特务分子李天庆、吴伯钧、袁阿木三人于今年5月9日夜里，由美军上尉雷蒙亲自护送他们到一孤岛，然后才在山东省海阳县董家庄草道咀登陆。他们在登陆的第二天早上，即被当地青年妇女辛清云、小姑娘董仁芬、张佩花发现。辛清云等随即向当地驻军报告。当地驻军与公安机关闻讯后立即进行搜查围捕。特务分子李天庆、袁阿木当场被捕获；特务分子吴伯钧鸣枪拒捕被我击伤，活捉后因伤势过重而死亡。这批特务分子所携带的各种联络器具、特工照像机、无声手枪和大批的金条、手表、人民币等全部被缴获。
    经侦讯证实，1955年1月，李天庆等三人从蒋介石的军队中被特务机关“国防部二厅”所征募，经美蒋特务机关合办的台北市北郊大直“南方训练班”训练后，于同年4月又被美国间谍机关“中央情报局”送往日本冲绳岛进行专门的特务训练。以后，他们被送往南朝鲜仁川附近的大伊作岛。在那里，美军上尉雷蒙领导他们进行登陆的活动。1955年11月到今年3月，这伙特务分子在美国间谍机关“中央情报局”东京间谍组织的指挥下，曾先后五次企图在我国东北和山东登陆，但都因气候不良或因我海防严密而未能得逞。后来在美国特务分子的直接派遣下，他们于今年5月9日夜间在山东省海阳县董家庄登陆。这伙特务分子在露宿一夜后，即被全部捕获。
    据被捕的特务分子供认：他们这次领受的美国特务机关的任务是：搜集我各种军事、政治、经济情报；搜集我各种迁移证、会员证等各种证件，并了解办理这些证件的手续，以便美国特务机关陆续派遣更多的特务间谍到我国大陆上来进行阴谋破坏活动。
    第二批登陆的美国特务分子是郑允海等三人，他们由美国特务机关的快艇护送，6月5日夜在特务分子李天庆等登陆的地点登陆。他们的任务是将第一批派遣来的三个特务分子接回去。但是他们的目的并没有达到，在当地驻军的围剿下，一名被活捉，一名被当场击毙，一名落海淹死。他们所携带的武器、物资全部被缴获。
    在破获这一特务案件中，当地妇女辛清云和小姑娘董仁芬、张佩花三人表现出高度的警惕性，对破案有功。山东省人民委员会为了表扬她们的爱国主义行为，特通令嘉奖，并发给她们奖金一千元。（附图片）
