Xinhua News Agency, August 4th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a televised broadcast speech on the Suez Canal issue on the evening of the 3rd.

In his speech, Dulles avoided mentioning that the nationalization of the Suez Canal was Egypt's sovereignty. He repeatedly emphasized the "international nature" of the canal. In his view, Western colonial countries had already "completely internationalized" the Suez Canal by strengthening unequal treaties imposed on Egypt. Therefore, Egypt's action of nationalizing this "international waterway" "goes far beyond the scope of a government nationalizing non-international companies and properties on its territory."

Dulles slandered Egyptian President Nasser's actions to safeguard national sovereignty as driven by the desire for "expansion" and political and economic "ambition." He deliberately ignored the Egyptian authorities' repeated assurances regarding the freedom of navigation on the canal and reaffirmed the position of Britain, France, and the United States in interfering in Egypt's internal affairs. He said: "A waterway that has been internationalized by treaties and is needed for the livelihood of dozens of countries cannot be allowed to be used by one country to achieve very selfish purposes; and the administrative organization required to implement the 1888 treaty cannot be overthrown as a national retaliatory action."

Dulles continued: "The question is not whether to take some measures against Egypt's actions, but what measures should be taken." He said: "Some argue that the governments most directly affected should take immediate coercive action. However, this would violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and would undoubtedly cause widespread violence, endangering world peace." Dulles said that the London talks among Britain, France, and the United States decided to take another approach. This is to convene a 24-nation conference to formulate a "plan for international control of the canal."

### 重申英法美三国干涉埃及的立场  杜勒斯叫嚣“国际管制”苏彝士运河

    重申英法美三国干涉埃及的立场
    杜勒斯叫嚣“国际管制”苏彝士运河
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯三日晚上就苏彝士运河问题发表电视广播演说。
    杜勒斯在演说中避而不谈把苏彝士运河收归国有是埃及的主权，他一味强调这条运河的“国际性质”。在他看来，西方殖民国家通过加强在埃及身上的不平等条约，已经使苏彝士运河“彻底国际化”，因此，埃及把这条“国际水路”收归国有的行动“已经远远超出了一国政府把在它领土上的非国际性质的公司和财产国有化的范围”。
    杜勒斯诽谤埃及总统纳赛尔维护民族主权的行动是出于“扩张”势力的要求和政治与经济的“野心”，他故意抹杀埃及当局一再提出的关于保障运河航行自由的保证，并且重申英法美三国干涉埃及内政的立场。他说：“不能容许一条为条约所国际化、为几十个国家的生计所需要的水道竟被一个国家利用来达到非常自私的目的；而执行1888年条约所需的管理机构竟作为一个国家的报复行动而被打倒。”
    杜勒斯接着说：“问题并不是是否要对埃及的这种行动采取某种措施而是应该采取什么措施。”他说：“有些人主张受到最直接影响的政府立即采取强制性的行动。但是，这会违反联合国宪章的原则，并且无疑会引起广泛的暴力行动，危及世界和平。”杜勒斯说，英法美三国伦敦会谈决定采取另一种做法。这就是召开二十四国会议，以便拟订一个“对运河实行国际管制的计划”。
