Xinhua News Agency, Duyun, August 9th. The first session of the first People's Congress of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which opened on August 1st in Duyun County, Guizhou Province, concluded yesterday, announcing the official establishment of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    256 people's representatives from eight ethnic groups, including Buyi, Miao, Shui, Yao, Hui, and Yi, attended the meeting. Sakongliao (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Tian Fuda (Gaoshan), member of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, and Zhou Lin, Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guizhou Province, also attended the meeting and congratulated the establishment of the autonomous prefecture.

    During the meeting, the representatives listened to, examined, and approved the report made by Jin Feng, Secretary of the Qiannan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Qiannan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, regarding the main work achievements and future work plans in the Qiannan area over the past six years. They elected Wei Maowen (Buyi) as the governor of the autonomous prefecture; Wu Dexiang (Miao), Luo Bingji (Buyi), Li Zhanwen (Han), Yang Binkui (Buyi), Wu Xiliang (Miao), Ban Fengquan (Buyi), and Lu Qingmei (Shui) as deputy governors; Wang Youzhi (Buyi) and twenty-seven others as members of the Prefectural People's Committee; and Wei Shiping (Buyi) as the president of the Intermediate People's Court of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The meeting also formulated and adopted the organizational regulations (draft) of the People's Congress and the People's Committee of the autonomous prefecture, and decided to locate the Prefectural People's Committee in Duyun County.

    In the five days of discussions and speeches at the meeting, the representatives unanimously agreed that since the liberation of the Qiannan area six years ago, all undertakings such as politics, economy, and culture have achieved rapid development. The entire region basically achieved agricultural cooperativization this spring. After the farmers organized themselves, they quickly changed the backward production methods such as "slash-and-burn cultivation" in the mountainous areas, making grain output surpass the highest level in history, and the income of people of all ethnic groups increased significantly. In the field of health, for example, due to the establishment of many health and medical institutions in remote mountainous areas, active training and cultivation of health personnel, and vigorous development of prevention and treatment work, the most prevalent infectious diseases such as malaria and smallpox in some areas in the past have been basically eliminated or reduced.

    While affirming the achievements, the representatives also pointed out that leaders at all levels did not fully understand the principle of "prudence and steady progress" in ethnic work, and some shortcomings and mistakes also occurred in the work. For example, in the agricultural cooperativization movement, especially in the process of transforming semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives into fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives in some areas this spring, many cadres ignored the characteristics and customs of ethnic minorities, and uniformly converted the ethnic minorities' "maiden fields," "cotton fields," "old-age fields," "old-age cattle," and mountain forests and bamboo into shares at a discounted price, with a tendency to undervalue them during the valuation process. In leading the development of mountain production, due to a lack of in-depth investigation and research into the natural conditions of the Qiannan area, there was a tendency to emphasize fine grains and neglect coarse grains, emphasize agriculture and neglect animal husbandry, forestry, and rural sideline occupations, which affected the vast number of farmers from engaging in diversified operations and obtaining more income.

    During the meeting, the representatives put forward 181 proposals related to the development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous prefecture.

    On the last day of the meeting, a congratulatory telegram was passed to Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups in China; Wei Maowen, on behalf of the 1.9 million people of all ethnic groups in Qiannan, presented Chairman Mao with eight gifts including the cool mat and bamboo flower basket handicrafts of the Buyi people of Libo County, which were accepted by Sakongliao, Vice Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, on behalf of Chairman Mao.

    黔南布依族苗族自治州成立
    举行了第一届人民代表大会第一次会议
    新华社都匀9日电　八月一日在贵州省都匀县开幕的黔南布依族苗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议已在昨天闭幕，会议宣布黔南布依族苗族自治州正式成立。
    出席这次会议的有布依、苗、水家、瑶、回、彝等八个民族的人民代表256人。中华人民共和国民族事物委员会副主任萨空了（蒙古族）、全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员田富达（高山族）和中共贵州省委书记、贵州省省长周林，也参加了这次会议，并且祝贺自治州的成立。
    会议期间，代表们听取、审查和批准了中共黔南地委书记金风，代表中共黔南地委作的关于黔南地区六年来主要工作情况和今后工作意见的报告。选出了韦茂文（布依族）为自治州州长；吴德祥（苗族）、罗秉楫（布依族）、李占稳（汉族）、杨彬奎（布依族）、吴锡良（苗族）、班凤泉（布依族）、陆庆美（水家族）为副州长；王由植（布依族）等二十七人为州人民委员会委员；韦时平（布依族）为黔南布依族苗族自治州中级人民法院院长。会议还制定和通过了自治州人民代表大会和人民委员会组织条例（草案），并决定以都匀县为自治州州人民委员会所在地。
    代表们在五天的讨论和大会发言中，一致认为：黔南地区解放六年来，政治、经济和文化等各项事业都获得了迅速的发展。全区在今年春天就基本上实现了农业合作化。农民们组织起来以后，迅速改变了山区“刀耕火种”等落后的生产方法，使粮食产量超过了历史上的最高水平，各族人民的收入因而显著增加。又如在卫生事业方面，由于在边远山区建立了许多卫生医疗机构，并积极训练和培养卫生人员，大力开展预防和治疗工作，已使过去部分地区流行最广的疟疾、天花等传染病症基本消灭或减少。
    代表们在肯定工作成绩的同时，也指出了各级领导由于对“慎重稳进”的民族工作方针领会不够，在工作中也产生了一些缺点和错误。如在农业合作化运动中，特别是在今年春季部分地区半社会主义的农业生产合作社转为完全社会主义的农业生产合作社的过程中，许多干部忽视了少数民族的特点和风俗习惯，将少数民族的“姑娘田”、“棉花地”、“养老田”、“养老牛”和山林竹木等都一律折价入社，在折价过程中又有偏低现象。在领导发展山区生产上，由于对黔南地区的自然条件缺乏深入的调查研究，产生了重细粮，轻粗粮，重农业，忽视畜牧、林业和农村副业等偏向，影响了广大农民开展多种经营，获得更多的收入。
    会议中，代表们提出了有关发展自治州的各项建设事业的提案181件。
    会议最后一天，通过了向中国各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席的致敬电；韦茂文代表黔南一百九十多万各族人民向毛主席献了荔波县布依族人民的手工艺品凉席、竹花篮等八件礼物，由民族事务委员会副主任萨空了代表毛主席接受了这些礼物。
