Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 9th: The flood peaks of various rivers in North China have passed through the Hebei Plain and reached the coast of the Bohai Sea. Flood control headquarters at all levels in Hebei Province are leading the people in the lower reaches of various rivers to take various measures to finally defeat the flood and protect the safety of coastal areas, especially Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway.

    200,000 flood control workers in the Tianjin and Cangxian regions have been投入 into intense battle, working day and night on the dikes to reinforce sub-dikes and consolidate embankments to meet the flood. Most of the cadres of the flood control headquarters at all levels have moved to the river dikes to work.

    The flood control departments in various parts of Hebei Province are also using the flood diversion channels of the Daqing River and the South and North Grand Canals to discharge water into the sea before the arrival of the super flood peak, reducing the backwater effect of the downstream flood peak. In addition, in the spirit of subordinating minor interests to major interests, various localities have taken the initiative to divert floodwaters into low-lying areas in the middle and lower reaches of various rivers to reduce the river's flow.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 9th: Today, the floodwaters from the Daqing, Ziya, and South Grand Canals flowing into Tianjin continued to rise compared to yesterday. At 6:00 PM, the water level at the Sixth Fort hydrological station in the western suburbs of Tianjin reached 7.45 meters, exceeding the warning level by 1.45 meters. The first flood peak of the Yongding River flowing into Tianjin has passed through Tianjin. The water level at Qujiadian in the northern suburbs fell slightly by 49 centimeters yesterday, but is still above the warning level.

    According to the person in charge of the Tianjin Flood Control Headquarters, the flood peaks of the Daqing, Ziya, and South Grand Canals will reach Tianjin tomorrow, and the water level of the Hai River in Tianjin will continue to rise. However, due to breaches in Liuli Road on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Daqing River and Yaomadu on the left bank of the Ziya River, the breach in Liuli Road alone is injecting more than 2,000 cubic meters per second into Wen'an Depression. Therefore, if there are no more heavy rainstorms in the upper reaches of the rivers recently and the Guanting Reservoir does not release water rapidly, it is estimated that the water level of the Hai River in Tianjin will not exceed the highest water level in 1954.

    The person in charge continued: In order to ensure victory over this flood, Tianjin has organized and prepared a large number of flood control personnel and materials.

    保卫天津市和津浦路的安全
    河北省采取措施准备最后战胜到达海滨的洪水
    据新华社保定9日电　华北各河洪峰已穿过河北平原到达渤海海滨。河北省各级防汛指挥部，正领导各河下游人民采取各种措施最后战胜洪水，保卫沿海地区特别是天津市和津浦铁路的安全。
    天津专区、沧县专区的二十万防汛民工已投入紧张的战斗，现在正日夜在堤顶上抢修子埝，加固堤防，迎接洪水。各级防汛指挥部干部大部分都搬上河堤办公。
    河北省各地防汛部门还利用大清河和南、北运河的分洪道，在特大洪峰到来之前提闸放水入海，减少洪峰下泄的顶托。此外，各地还根据小利益服从大利益的精神，主动在各河中、下游向低洼地区分洪，以杀减各河水势。
    据新华社天津9日电　今天，大清、子牙、南运河下注天津的洪水比昨天续有上升。下午六时，天津市西郊第六堡水文站的水位已达七公尺四十五公分，超过警戒水位一公尺四十五公分。永定河下注天津的首次洪峰已流过天津，北郊区屈家店的水位在昨天微落了四十九公分，但仍在警戒水位以上。
    据天津市防汛指挥部的负责人说，大清、子牙、南运河的洪峰将在明天到达天津，天津海河的水位将继续上涨。但由于大清河上游右岸的六里路和子牙河左岸的遥马渡两地发生了决口，仅六里路的决口就以两千多秒公方的流量注入文安洼，因此，最近如各河上游不再降暴雨，官厅水库不急剧放闸，估计天津海河的水位不会超过1954年的最高水位。
    这位负责人继续说：为了保证战胜这次洪水，天津已组织和准备了大批防汛的人力和物力。
