    "Artists are Really Hard to Invite!"
    Ren Jiaji
    July 25th – The morning of the preview of the "Beijing Arts and Crafts Exhibition," the head of the Beijing Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative Union, the exhibition's organizer, and more than a dozen well-known veteran artists anxiously checked their watches every few minutes, muttering, "Why haven't they arrived yet?!"
    It turned out that this exhibition was the first comprehensive exhibition of Beijing's special handicrafts, showcasing nearly a thousand new works by artisans after joining the cooperative. To further improve the artistic level of the handicrafts, the Arts and Crafts Union had sent out more than a dozen invitations a few days prior, inviting more than a dozen arts and crafts masters in Beijing to visit, discuss, and provide guidance on the day of the preview.
    Time passed mercilessly, and the clock hand pointed to eleven. There was no other option but to hold an artisans' forum without the participation of the artists. After the meeting, the head of the Arts and Crafts Union investigated the reasons for the artists' absence: Could it be that the mimeographed invitations were too disrespectful? Were the invitations sent out too late? Did the invitations not specify the time for the visit and discussion? ... So, it was decided to hold another forum and immediately send someone to buy invitations printed with art patterns, writing "July 30th, 9:00 AM...". The invitations were sent out the next day. Furthermore, a banquet was booked at the Senlong Restaurant to entertain the "visiting and guiding" artists.
    On the morning of the 30th, the gray-haired veteran artists and the head of the Arts and Crafts Union were once again disappointed. It was past ten o'clock, and not a single artist had arrived. When they made phone calls to urge them to come, the responses were either "not at home" or "don't know where they've gone." The veteran artists had already arrived, and the meal was prepared, so they had to hold another forum without the participation of the artists. It was not until 10:30 that two art workers from the Arts and Crafts Science Research Institute arrived late. The other dozen or so renowned arts and crafts masters were nowhere to be seen until twelve o'clock.
    The head of the Arts and Crafts Union sighed and said, "Artists are really hard to invite!"
    If it were just the above two instances, then it would be fine not to mention it. However, take a look at the history of "cooperation" between Beijing's arts and crafts masters and special arts veteran artisans!
    Beijing is the cultural center of the country, home to the China Artists Association, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Arts and Crafts Science Research Institute, and the newly established Central Academy of Arts and Design, concentrating a large number of famous artists. At the same time, Beijing is the most concentrated area of special handicrafts in the country, with a long history and a wide variety, requiring the strong assistance of artists to promote and improve these artistic heritages of the motherland. However, in recent years, apart from a very few, such as Professor Zheng Ke of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, not a single artist has stepped into the artisans' production workshops. After the collectivization of Beijing's special handicraft industry, industries such as ivory, jade, lacquer carving, and cloisonné have held several product observation exhibitions, sending out many invitations, but very few artists have come to provide guidance.
    An old artisan told me about two things: In 1954, when he was designing a large-scale ivory carving work, he invited professors from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to the cooperative three times for guidance, but he couldn't get them to come. The professors first said "we have a meeting, no time"; the second time they said "no time, bring the ivory blank," but the ivory weighed more than one hundred and twenty catties, making it impossible to "move the burden to seek instruction." The third time, a professor said hesitantly, "If only there was a car." The old artisan thought, where would the cooperative get a car? When members go out for work, they have to think twice before taking a pedicab. Thus, the artists' guidance could only be "quenching thirst with plums." This year, this old artisan had to go to a certain place to experience life in order to create another work, and the Art Service Department sent an art worker who studies embroidery to go with him. However, this art worker only stayed in the local area for one day and then left the old artisan, going to do his own research. As a result, the local cultural authorities sent personnel to assist the old artisan in completing the task.
    It would be unfair to say that the artists have not offered any opinions on the handicrafts. In the June 16th issue of "New Observer" this year, eight artists from the China Artists Association, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Central Arts and Crafts Science Research Institute published "Opinions on Exported Handicrafts." The veteran artisans said: The artists' criticisms of the handicrafts' unattractive shapes and outdated forms are very correct. However, we have only technical skills and lack artistic theoretical knowledge, making it difficult to create ideal shapes and patterns.
    Now, to improve the artistic level of handicrafts, in addition to the criticism of the artists, more importantly, is the specific help to the artisans. Artists, extend your hands!

### “美术家真难请！”

    “美术家真难请！”
    任家骥
    七月二十五日——“北京工艺美术品展览会”举行预展的那天上午，主办展览会的北京市工艺美术品生产合作社联合社的负责人和十几位著名的老艺人焦急地隔一会就看一下表，嘴里直嘀咕：“怎么还没有来？！”
    原来，这次展览是北京特种手工艺品第一次综合性展览，展出艺人们参加合作社后的近一千件新作品。为了进一步提高工艺品的艺术水平，工艺美术品联社前两天就发出十几张请柬，请在京的十几位工艺美术家在预展这天来参观、座谈、指导。
    时间无情地过去了，时针已指向十一点，没有办法，只得举行一个没有美术家参加的艺人座谈会。会后，工艺美术品联社负责人研究了美术家没来的原因：是不是油印的请柬太不恭敬了？请柬发出的时间太晚了？请柬上没有注明参观和座谈的时间吧？……于是决定再开一次座谈会，并立即派人去买来印有美术图案的请柬，写着“七月三十日上午九时举行……”。请柬在第二天就发出了。并且，在森隆饭馆预订了酒席，准备招待“光临指导”的美术家们。
    三十日上午，须发皆白的老艺人和工艺美术品联社的负责人又失望了。已过十点，一位美术家都没有来。分头打电话催请，得到的回答，不是“不在家”，就是“不知上哪儿去了”。老艺人们已经来了，饭也准备了，于是只得再举行一次没有美术家参加的座谈会。到十点半，工艺美术科学研究所的两个美术工作者才姗姗而来。其他十几位有名望的工艺美术家，直到十二点也没有看见影子。
    工艺美术品联社负责人感叹地说：“美术家真难请！”
    如果仅仅只是上面这两次的情况，那倒不说也罢了，但是，请看看北京工艺美术家和特艺老艺人“合作”的历史吧！
    北京是全国文化的中心，驻着中国美术家协会、中央美术学院、中央工艺美术科学研究所和新建立的中央工艺美术学院，集中了大批著名的美术家。同时，北京又是全国特种手工艺品最集中的地方，历史悠久，品种繁多，需要美术家大力帮助，使这些祖国的艺术遗产得到发扬、提高。可是，几年来，除了极个别的，如中央美术学院郑可教授外，没有一个美术家跨进过艺人们的生产车间。北京市特种手工艺合作化后，象牙、玉器、雕漆、景泰蓝等行业开过几次产品观摩展览会，发了很多请柬，可是光临指导的美术家寥寥无几。
    一位老艺人告诉我这样两件事：1954年，他在设计某一件大型象牙雕刻作品的时候，曾三次请中央美术学院的教授到社里来指导，都没有请到。教授们第一次说“要开会，没时间”；第二次说“没有功夫，把象牙胚子拿来吧”，可是象牙有一百二十多斤重，无法“移樽就教”。第三次，有位教授吞吞吐吐地说：“那怕有辆车子哩。”老艺人想合作社那来的小汽车，社员们因工作外出，坐三轮都得考虑半天。于是，对美术家的指导只好“望梅止渴”。今年，这位老艺人为了创作另一件作品，须到某地体验生活，美术服务部派了一位研究刺绣的美术工作者和他同去。可是，这位美术工作者只在当地逗留一天就离开了老艺人，搞自己的研究工作去了。结果，还是当地文化机关派员协助老艺人完成了任务。
    如果说美术家对工艺品没有提过意见，那也是不公正的。就在今年六月十六日出版的一期“新观察”上，中国美术家协会、中央美术学院和中央工艺美术科学研究所的八位美术家曾发表了“对出国工艺品的意见”。老艺人们说：美术家们指责工艺品的造型不美，形式陈旧，都是非常对的。可是，我们徒有技术，缺乏艺术理论知识，很难创造理想的造型和图案。
    现在，要提高工艺品的艺术水平，除了需要美术家的批评外，更重要的是对艺人们的具体帮助。美术家们，伸出你们的手来吧！
