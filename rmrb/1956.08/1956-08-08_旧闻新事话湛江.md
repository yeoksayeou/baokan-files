Old News and New Stories of Zhanjiang
By our special correspondent Huang Guliu

(Continued from yesterday)

Just like Dalian and Lushun, Zhanjiang is also composed of two separate towns - Xiying and Chikan. The two places are thirteen kilometers apart, with transportation maintained by cars and trains. Because the port area wharf and the terminal station of the Li-Zhan Railway are both in Xiying, the center of urban construction is placed in Xiying.

The construction units of the port and the management units of the port affairs - the Engineering Bureau and the Port Affairs Bureau - are working together. The construction work of the construction unit has not yet ended, and the work of the management unit has already started in advance. Following closely behind are the relevant units of the trade system. People are busy doing business with as many countries in the world as possible. There are many things to do to welcome the first ocean-going vessel into the port. The temporary sheds built with thatch, bamboo and wood now have tens of thousands of employees working and living in them. Behind those low sheds, under the boundless clear sky, new-style yellow-walled buildings are being built. Initially, the port authority office building, the customs office building, the seaport quarantine station and the trade building were built; followed by the dormitory buildings of the port affairs and trade systems. To be built are the Seamen's Club, the Workers' Cultural Palace and the Municipal Government Office Building. One day soon, those temporary sheds that have completed their arduous tasks will be demolished. Although the entire project has not yet been completed, every part that has been completed is fascinating.

Walking into the port area, you can see several of the latest gantry electric cranes arranged on the reinforced concrete high-pile frame deep-water wharf. A young technician named Wu Huawu climbed onto the control tower and skillfully drove this giant crane. The sandbag used for practice was accurately grabbed by him with the "elephant trunk hook" and placed in the designated position. He stood in the driver's cab, looked down through the surrounding glass windows, overlooking the wide sea surface of the port, the brand-new warehouses and the crowds on the wharf square. The young man's eyes contained a kind of undisguised complacent smile. Trains will pass under his crotch, and giant ships of more than 10,000 tons will come to his side. When he starts the machine, no matter who it is, they will look up at him. In just a few months, he has become the master of driving this new-style electric crane. What was he doing a few months ago? In his own words, "I was a dock worker, formerly called a coolie." Now he understands the performance of the machine and the principle of electricity, and he has begun to master the technology. The days of doing heavy work with his shoulders have passed. It's not just him, the young men waiting for their turn to practice at the foot of the crane, and the young men who are driving universal loading and unloading vehicles and electric flatbed trucks back and forth on the square in front of the warehouse, are all his young apprentices who used to carry goods on the wharf.

Chief Engineer Comrade Tan Zhen came to the construction site to inspect the work. He is a thin, tall Southerner who has lived in the North for decades. He looked around and went to the eastern end of the deep-water wharf to see the drilling machine working. The geological structure here is particularly complex, with a layer of dark gray soft clay under the sandy soil. It is necessary to accurately study its structure and distribution, and test its properties, and then find a way to prevent the cement and steel piles from collapsing or shifting. This kind of foundation engineering cannot be sloppy at all. The workers all know this modest and simple old engineer, admire his true talent and practical knowledge. If it weren't for his "impact drilling method" to overcome the complex seabed terrain here last August, Wu Huawu would not be able to have the happiness of stepping into the cab of the gantry electric crane today. At that time, it took sixty hours to drive a pile. As soon as Chief Engineer Tan's new operation method came out, it only took four hours at the fastest to drive a pile. This was successfully tested by him and the technicians and workers on the piling ship "301" for twenty consecutive hours. Wharf piling is the key to the construction of the wharf project. This creative labor of engineers and workers played a decisive role in the early completion of the port construction project. Chief Engineer Tan is already fifty-eight years old this year, and his health was not very good, but he forgot his illness and worked very hard, and he looked younger and younger. In addition to fully leading the engineering of the Engineering Bureau, he also compiled his own lectures, took four hours a week to teach the engineering and technical personnel of the entire bureau, and led them to march towards science.

Someone asked him about his life and ideological situation before and after liberation. He told such an interesting story: After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang government hired him as the chief engineer of Tanggu New Port. In fact, it was just to put on a show with him, and the corrupt and incompetent Kuomintang did not really need engineers. He hated the Kuomintang, but he did not understand the Communist Party either. After liberation, he thought: "How can the Communist Party still use us people who have worked with the Kuomintang?" So he retired and went home to recuperate. Our military representative went to his home to see him and invited him to come out to work for the people. He asked him what personal difficulties and requirements he had. He thought to himself: "It's probably impossible not to work; well, let's do it and see." As for difficulties and requirements, he couldn't think of anything, because he had no children, only an old wife, living in Tianjin, and his life was simple and plain, so he didn't need any care. He replied to the military representative: "I only have one request; go home once a week to see my old wife."... Now whenever he thinks of this, he laughs heartily, mocking his own naivety and ignorance back then. The completion of Tanggu New Port educated him and made him understand the Communist Party. Today, he is shouldering the important task entrusted to him by the country - leading the construction of a new type of modern Zhanjiang Port. He feels that the successful completion of this glorious task is the greatest happiness in his life. The path taken by this old engineer who studied in the United States in his early years is also the path that tens of thousands of Chinese scientists and engineers who are still studying or working in countries such as Britain, the United States, and France will take.

In the evening, Comrade Zhou Lun, Director of the Engineering Bureau, came to the dormitory building of the Port Affairs Bureau to visit several friends who came to visit. He introduced to the guests the overall picture of Zhanjiang Port and the joys and hardships of the port construction project. Comrade Zhou Lun said to them: "Before liberation, there were only four people in the whole country who had studied port construction engineering. At that time, the important ports in the country were all in the hands of foreigners, and it was useless to study. Now we need this kind of talent in large quantities. Dalian Institute of Technology has a port construction department, and we have also practically trained a group of talents in Tanggu, Nanjing and Hainan Island. As long as you are willing to delve into it, outsiders will soon become experts. However, as the work moves forward rapidly, no matter how many talents are cultivated, it cannot meet the needs of the objective situation." Comrade Zhou Lun added, "Port engineering and port management have a characteristic, that is, the technology is very complex. All technical issues such as wharves, warehouses, shipping, aviation, highways, wired telegraphy, wireless telegraphy, railways, hydrology, meteorology, geology, etc., are concentrated together. How to divide labor, how to coordinate, is both science and art. In short, no matter how complex and difficult it is, we can not only build it well, but also manage it well. We are building a family industriously and frugally in the face of difficulties."

Yes, this place, which was once called the "end of the world" by the Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo, can certainly be built into a beautiful and modern port city in the hands of our people, and can be managed in full compliance with the requirements.

    旧闻新事话湛江
    本报特约记者　黄谷柳
       （续昨）
    就像大连和旅顺那样，湛江也是由两个互相隔开的市镇——西营和赤坎——构成的。两地相隔十三公里，当中有汽车和火车维系交通。因为港区码头和黎湛铁路终点站都在西营，城市建设的中心就放在西营。
    建港的施工单位和港务的管理单位——工程局和港务局——都挤在一块工作。施工单位的工程还没有结束，管理单位的工作已经提前开始。紧跟在后边的是贸易系统的有关单位。人民为了要跟世界上尽可能多的国家做买卖而忙碌起来。迎接第一只远洋轮船的入港，是有许多事情要做的，用茅草竹木盖的临时工棚，现在有上万的职工在里面工作和食宿。在那些矮矮的工棚的背后，在无边的晴空下面，一幢幢新式的黄色粉墙的大楼建筑起来了。最初盖起的是港务局办公大楼，海关办公大楼，海港检疫所和贸易大楼；接着是港务和贸易系统的宿舍大楼。将要盖的是海员俱乐部、工人文化宫和市府办公大楼。不久的一天，那些完成了它的艰巨任务的临时工棚就会被拆掉。如今全部工程虽然还没有最后完成，但是已经完成的每一个部分都引人入胜。
    走进港区，就看到几座最新式的门式电动起重机排列在钢筋混凝土高桩框架式的深水码头上。一个叫吴华武的青年技工登上操纵塔，很熟练地驾驶着这座巨型的起重机。用作练习的沙包，被他很准确地用“象鼻勾”抓住放到圈定的位置上。他站在驾驶室里，透过周围的玻璃窗，居高临下，俯视着港里宽阔的海面、崭新的仓库和码头广场上的人群。这个青年人的眼睛里含着一种遮掩不住的自得其乐的笑意。火车将从他的跨下穿过，万吨以上的巨轮就来靠在他的身边。当他开动机器的时候，不管是谁，都会仰起头来瞅他一眼。只不过是几个月的光景，他已经变成了驾驶这座新式电动起重机的主人。几个月之前，他是干什么的呢？用他自己的话来说，“我是一个码头工人，从前人家叫做苦力。”现在他懂得了机器的性能和电的原理，他开始掌握了技术。用肩膀干重活的日子已经过去了。这不光是他自己，在起重机脚下等候轮流练习的小伙子们，还有在仓库前面广场上驾着万能装卸车和电力板车来回兜圈子练习的小伙子们，全是他往日在码头上搬运货物的青年小伙计。
    总工程师谭真同志到工地检查工作来了。瘦个子，高身材，是个在北方住了几十年的南方人。他向周围看了一下，就到深水码头的东端，看那部钻探机进行工作。这里的地层构造特别复杂，砂土底下还有一层深灰色的松软的粘土。要准确地研究它的结构和分布的情况，并且化验它的性质，然后找出办法来使打下去的水泥钢筋桩脚不至陷塌或移位。这种基础工程，丝毫也不能马虎。工人们都认识这个谦虚朴实的老工程师，佩服他的真才实学，要不是他去年八月想出了个“冲捣孔打桩法”来战胜这里复杂的海底地形，吴华武今天还不能有跨进门式电动起重机驾驶室的幸福。那时候，打一根桩要六十小时，谭总工程师的新操作法一出来，打一根桩最快只要四小时。这是他跟技术人员和工人在“301”号打桩船上，一连坚持了二十小时的时间试验成功的。码头打桩是修建码头工程的关键，工程师和工人们的这种创造性劳动对建港工程提前完工起了决定性的作用。谭总工程师今年已经五十八岁了，身体本来不大好，可是他忘记了自己的疾病，工作很起劲，越来越显得年青。他除了全面领导工程局的工程之外，还自己编写讲义，每星期拿出四小时来给全局的工程技术人员上课，带领他们向科学进军。
    有人问过他解放前后的生活和思想情况。他讲出这么一件趣事：抗日战争结束以后，国民党政府聘他做塘沽新港的总工程师。其实是用他来摆个样子，腐败无能的国民党并不是真正用得着工程师的。他痛恨国民党，可是他也不了解共产党。解放以后，他想：“共产党哪还会用我们这些跟国民党干过事的人呢？”就退职回家休养了。我们的军事代表上门去看他，邀他出来替人民办事。问他个人有什么困难和要求。他心里想：“不工作大概不行了；好吧，干着瞧吧。”至于困难和要求，他可想不出，因为他没有孩子，只有一个老妻，住在天津，生活是清淡朴素的，不需要什么照顾。他回答军事代表说：“我只有一个要求；每星期回家一次，看看我的老妻。”……现在每逢想起这件事，他就哈哈大笑，嘲笑自己当年的幼稚和无知。塘沽新港的建成教育了他，使他认识了共产党。今天，他担负着国家交给他的这件重大任务——领导修建一个新型的现代化的湛江港，他觉得胜利完成这件光荣任务，就是一生最大的幸福了。这位早年留学美国的老工程师走的路，也是今天仍在英、美、法等国留学或工作着的上万个中国科学家、工程师们将要走的路。
    傍晚，工程局局长周纶同志到港务局的宿舍大楼来看望几位来访问的朋友。他向客人们介绍了湛江港的全貌和建港工程进行的甘苦。周纶同志对他们说：“解放前，全国学过港湾建筑工程的总共才不过四个人。在那个时候，全国重要的港湾都掌握在外国人手上，学了也没有用处。现在我们大量需要这种人材。大连工学院设有港湾建筑系，我们在塘沽、南京和海南岛也实地锻炼了一批人材。只要肯钻进去，外行人很快就会成为专家。可是工作向前猛进，不管培养出多少人材，也满足不了客观形势的需要。”周纶同志又说，“海港工程和海港管理有个特点，就是技术性非常复杂。所有码头、仓库、航运、空运、公路、有线电、无线电、铁路、水文、气象、地质等等技术性问题，都集中在一起。怎样分工，怎样协同，既是科学，也是艺术。总之，不管多么复杂和困难，我们既能修建好，自然也能管理好。我们是在困难中勤俭兴家的。”
    是的，这个曾经被宋朝诗人苏东坡称做“天涯海角”的地方，在我们人民的手里，是一定能修建成为一座美丽的、现代化海港城市，并且能管理得完全符合要求。
