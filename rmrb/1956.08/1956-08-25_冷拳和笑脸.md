	Cold Punch and Smiling Face

	Not long ago, Victor Franco, a reporter for the French evening newspaper "Paris News," attended a reception at the home of an American Vice Consul in Algiers. He went with enthusiasm, but returned disappointed. It turned out that at this reception, the Americans, while toasting "Franco-American friendship," openly and triumphantly discussed American activities to squeeze out French influence in Algeria.

	The reporter from this consistently pro-American newspaper also felt he could no longer tolerate it. He angrily wrote a report exposing the facts he learned at the reception:

	An American company had written to all real estate agents in Algeria, trying to find ways to acquire land from French colonists. "Americans living in Algeria, with their pockets bulging with gold, are trying to buy everything that is for sale every day."

	Most American journalists in Algeria are engaged in "cloak and dagger" activities against France.

	An American Vice Consul in Algeria had arranged a meeting between Irving Brown, the AFL-CIO representative in Europe, and Guy Gomis, Chairman of the Algiers Junior Chamber of Commerce, to secretly undermine French commercial interests. …

	All the facts mentioned in this report seem to be undeniable. Because, apart from denying they knew of any new American investment interests in Algeria, the American officials could only remain silent about Franco's accusations. Therefore, even the American magazine "Newsweek" had to admit that this matter "would shock even the most thick-skinned Americans living abroad."

	However, even more shocking is the French government's attitude towards this report. The French Foreign Ministry hurriedly issued a statement defending the American government, saying: "If the French believe that the U.S. State Department is carrying out activities against French interests in Algeria, then they are wrong."

	No one would believe that what the French Foreign Ministry said in its statement was sincere. It is nothing new for American "friends" to take advantage of the situation and squeeze out the influence of their French comrades. The lessons of Indochina are still fresh in the minds of the French; and the French government is also well aware that the American camel wants to squeeze into the tent of French colonists in Algeria, just like it did in South Vietnam. When French Foreign Minister Pineau visited Washington in June, he answered when asked about the Algerian issue: "We don't want another Indochina."

	However, despite France's wariness of its American "friends," it still has to rely on American support when suppressing the Algerian people's liberation movement. France needs the approval of NATO to transfer troops stationed in West Germany to reinforce the colonial army in Algeria. France uses some of the weapons supplied by the United States to fight against the Algerian people. France also relies on American "aid" to make up for some of the financial deficit caused by huge war expenses. Furthermore, Paris seems to have not completely abandoned the illusion that giving more smiling faces to the "friends" across the ocean is necessary to maintain that "precious friendship."

	Being punched with a cold fist and still having to put on a smiling face is indeed a pathetic situation. In fact, for France, it is possible to find true friends in Algeria and no longer have to endure this kind of cold punch, as long as it recognizes the Algerian people's right to self-determination and conducts negotiations with Algeria on a peaceful and equal basis.

    冷拳和笑脸
    不久以前，法国“巴黎新闻”晚报的记者维克多·法朗科在阿尔及尔参加了一位美国副领事家里举行的一次招待会。他乘兴而去，却落得个败兴而归。原来，在这次招待会上，美国人一面为“法美友谊”举杯，一面却公然得意地谈论起美国在阿尔及利亚排挤法国势力的活动。
    这家一贯亲美的报纸的记者也感到忍无可忍了。他恼怒地写了一篇报道，揭发了他在这次招待会上所得知的事实：
    美国一家公司曾经写信给阿尔及利亚所有的房地产代理人，想办法收购法国殖民者手中的地皮。“住在阿尔及利亚的美国人，口袋里胀鼓鼓地装满了金元，每天想买进一切出售的东西”。
    美国在阿尔及利亚的大部分新闻界人士，都进行着反对法国的“外套与短剑”的活动。
    美国在阿尔及利亚的一位副领事曾经为美国劳联—产联驻欧洲代表欧文·布朗和阿尔及尔青年商会主席居伊·哥密斯安排了一次会面，来暗中破坏法国的商业利益。……
    这篇报道里所提到的一切事实，看来都是确凿无疑的。因为，美国官方除了否认他们知道美国在阿尔及利亚有什么新的投资利益而外，对法朗科的指责只能采取不表示态度的办法。因此，连美国“新闻周刊”杂志也不得不承认，这件事“甚至使脸皮最厚的侨居国外的美国人都会感到震惊”。
    但是，更令人震惊的是法国政府的对这篇报道的态度。法国外交部急急忙忙发表了一个声明，为美国政府辩护说：“如果法国人认为美国国务院在阿尔及利亚进行着反对法国利益的活动，那末他们就错了。”
    没有人会相信，法国外交部声明里所说的是真心话。美国“朋友”趁火打劫，排挤法国伙计的势力，并不是什么新颖的事情。印度支那的教训，对法国说来是记忆犹新；而美国骆驼想和在南越一样挤进阿尔及利亚法国殖民者的帐篷，法国政府也知道得很清楚。法国外交部长比诺在六月份访问华盛顿的时候，当有人问到阿尔及利亚的问题，他就回答说：“我们不希望有另一个印度支那。”
    然而，尽管法国对美国“朋友”存有戒心，但是在镇压阿尔及利亚人民解放运动的时候，它又要仰仗美国给它撑腰。法国需要北大西洋公约组织同意，从西德抽调驻军去增援在阿尔及利亚的殖民军队。法国用美国供给的一部分武器，同阿尔及利亚人民作战。法国还依靠美“援”来弥补一部分因战费庞大而产生的财政赤字。再说，巴黎似乎还没有完全抛弃这样一种幻觉：对大洋彼岸的“朋友”多陪些笑脸是维系那“可贵的友谊”所必需的。
    挨了冷拳还得陪笑脸，这样的处境确实算得可悲的了。其实，对于法国来说，原是能够从阿尔及利亚找到真正的朋友而不必再挨这种冷拳的，只要它承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利，在和平和平等的基础上和阿尔及利亚进行协商。
