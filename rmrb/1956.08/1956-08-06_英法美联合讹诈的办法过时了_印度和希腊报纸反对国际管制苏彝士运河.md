Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 5th: Indian newspapers are criticizing the joint communiqué issued by Britain, France, and the United States regarding the Suez Canal issue.

    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said on August 3rd that the London talks between Britain, the United States, and France were "a desperate attempt to complicate the issue by all unreasonable and indecent means." The newspaper warned: "Therefore, if the peace of the Suez Canal or international peace is really threatened, Britain and its allies will bear full responsibility for this."

    The newspaper emphasized that the Western countries' proposal to implement international control over the Suez Canal is an attempt to restore the position originally held by foreign exploiters, which has been cancelled by Egypt.

    The "Bombay Chronicle" said: "The time when joint blackmail by the three countries was effective has passed." The newspaper believes that "the ideal solution—a solution that is fair and reasonable to all parties concerned—is that the West should recognize Egypt's rights and accept President Nasser's solemn guarantee of non-interference with canal navigation, lift economic sanctions, change the tone of aggression, and hold a world conference to replace the outdated Treaty of Constantinople."

    The "National Herald" pointed out: Those who talk about internationalizing the Suez Canal refuse to hand over the Panama Canal to international control. "It is difficult for people to accept the US's assumption that the Suez Canal should have one rule, while the Panama Canal should have another rule."

    The newspaper said: "To talk about internationalization in order to internationalize the company itself or to deprive Egypt of its legitimate rights by other means is a further provocation to the national sentiment of the East."

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: According to Athens reports: The "Athens Messenger" published a commentary on the 4th, sharply criticizing the attitude of Britain on the Suez Canal issue.

    The newspaper, which generally reflects the views of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the opinions of Egypt and Greece are similar.

    The newspaper cited the fact that the United States has managed the Panama Canal alone for more than 50 years as an example to refute the British claim that the Suez Canal cannot be managed by a single country.

### 英法美联合讹诈的办法过时了  印度和希腊报纸反对国际管制苏彝士运河

    英法美联合讹诈的办法过时了
    印度和希腊报纸反对国际管制苏彝士运河
    据新华社新德里5日电　印度报纸抨击关于苏彝士运河问题的英法美三国联合公报。
    “甘露市场报”在八月三日说：英美法三国伦敦会谈是“企图用一切无理和不体面的办法来使问题复杂化的一种绝望的尝试”。报纸警告说：“因此，如果苏彝士运河的和平或国际和平真的受到威胁的话，英国和它的盟国将对此负完全的责任。”
    报纸强调指出，西方国家提出对苏彝士运河实行国际管制的主张，是想重新恢复已经被埃及取消的外国剥削者原来据有的地位。
    “孟买纪事报”说：“三国联合讹诈行之有效的时候已经过去了。”这家报纸认为，“理想的解决办法——即对一切有关方面都公平合理的解决办法，是西方应该承认埃及的权利和接受纳赛尔总统关于不干涉运河通航的庄严保证，取消经济制裁和改变侵略的腔调，并且举行世界会议以便换去过了时的君士坦丁堡公约。”
    “国民先驱报”指出：那些谈论把苏彝士运河国际化的人却拒绝把巴拿马运河交由国际管制。“人们是难于接受美国的这种假设的，就是苏彝士运河应当有一个规则，而巴拿马运河则应当有另外一个规则。”
    这家报纸说：“为了使公司本身国际化或者用其他方法剥夺埃及的合法权利而谈论国际化，都是对东方民族情绪的进一步挑衅。”
    据新华社5日讯　据雅典消息：“雅典报信者报”四日发表评论，尖锐抨击英国在苏彝士运河问题上所抱的态度。
    这家一般地反映希腊外交部意见的报纸说：埃及和希腊的意见是相类似的。
    这家报纸用美国单独管理了巴拿马运河五十多年的事实为例，驳斥英国提出的关于苏彝士运河不能由单独一国管理的说法。
