Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The Shizitan Hydropower Station has cultivated a mechanized construction team. At present, this power station has more than two thousand mechanical construction workers in over thirty types of work, including excavators, tractors, and various cranes and locomotives.

    The Shizitan Hydropower Station has held two training classes for technical workers in construction machinery, training more than 280 operators and maintenance workers for seven types of work, including various locomotives, cranes, and excavators. The hydropower station adopted a "learning by doing" method for newly recruited apprentices. Now, more than two-thirds of the technical workers in mechanical construction on the construction site are newly trained after the start of construction. The third batch of new workers is currently being trained.

    After the completion of the entire project of this power station by the end of this year, the technical workers in mechanical construction will not only be able to meet the construction needs of the Minjiang River upstream hydropower station and the Longxi River Huilongzhai Hydropower Station, which are about to start construction, but also be able to supply other regions' hydropower construction departments.

    两千名新生力量
    据新华社讯　狮子滩水电站培养出一支机械化的施工队伍。目前，这个电站拥有包括掘土机、拖拉机及各类起重机、机关车等三十多个工种共两千名以上的机械施工的工人。
    狮子滩水电站先后举办过两期施工机械的技术工人训练班，训练出各类机关车、起重机及掘土机等七个工种运转和检修工人共二百八十多名。水电站对于新招收的学徒工，采取了“边做边学”的办法，现在，工地上机械施工的技术工人中，有三分之二以上都是开工后新培养出来的。目前正在培养的是第三批新工人了。
    这个电站的全部工程到今年年底建设成功后，机械施工的技术工人除能满足就要开工的岷江上游水电站和龙溪河回龙寨水电站建设的需要外，还可以向其他地区的水电建设部门输送。（附图片）
