    Market Vignettes

    For Whose Convenience?
    Customer: The collar is too low…
    Clerk: A low collar is comfortable for the neck.
    Customer: The waist is too wide…
    Clerk: A wide waist is perfect for wearing a sweater in winter.
    Customer: The sleeves are too short…
    Clerk: Short sleeves are convenient for working.
    Customer: The pant legs are too long…
    Clerk: Long pant legs will shrink just right after washing.
    Customer: This cloth has been pre-shrunk.
    Clerk: One shrinking is not enough, it will shrink again after washing!
    Customer: Shrink again? Then wouldn't the collar be even lower, and the sleeves even shorter?
    Clerk: Well… it would be even more convenient for working.
       Things Are Different Now
    Customer: I want to buy a pound of kerosene.
    Clerk: Not selling it. We are off work.
    Customer: I came from far away, it's only been two minutes past closing time, please sell me a pound…
    Clerk: No, that's our policy!
    Customer: Policy? A few days ago, I came in the middle of the night, and you still sold it to me?
    Clerk: Things are different now than before. We are now a joint state-private enterprise, everything is standardized.

    为谁方便
    顾客：领子太矮了……
    店员：领子矮，脖子在里边舒服。
    顾客：腰身太宽了……
    店员：腰身宽点，冬天穿毛衣正好。
    顾客：袖子太短了……
    店员：袖子短，工作起来方便。
    顾客：裤腿太长了……
    店员：裤腿长，下水一缩刚合适。
    顾客：我这布是下过水的。
    店员：一次缩不够，洗了还要缩！
    顾客：还要缩？那领子不就更矮，袖子不就更短了吗？
    店员：那……工作起来就更方便了。
       今非昔比
    顾客：我买一斤煤油。
    店员：不卖了。我们下班了。
    顾客：我从老远的地方来，营业时间刚过两分钟，你就卖给我一斤吧……
    店员：不行，这是我们的制度！
    顾客：制度？前些日子，我半夜里来，你们怎么还卖啊？
    店员：现在不比从前，我们已公私合营，一切都正规化了。
