Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th: The London conference to discuss the Suez issue is about to begin tomorrow. Delegations from various countries attending the conference have arrived in London one after another. On the eve of the conference, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, who initiated the conference, are intensifying their activities in an attempt to get the conference to adopt a so-called "international control" plan for the Suez Canal.

    The British Cabinet held a meeting on the 14th to discuss the policy Britain will adopt at the conference. Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who had just arrived in Britain from the United States, also attended the British Cabinet meeting to report on his recent talks with American leaders in Washington on the Suez Canal issue.

    On the same day, British Prime Minister Eden and Foreign Secretary Lloyd held talks with Indian delegation head Menon, who will be attending the conference.

    The French Cabinet also held a meeting on the 14th. The meeting approved a plan advocating the establishment of a powerful international organization to control the Suez Canal. A French Cabinet spokesman said that the French delegation was prepared to discuss this plan with the British and American representatives before the opening of the meeting on the 15th. He also said that France hoped this plan would become the basis for a joint British, French, and American plan.

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held a last-minute meeting with Under Secretary of State Hoover and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford at the airport before flying to London on the 14th. In addition, Dulles also held talks with British Ambassador Makins and West German Ambassador Krekeler.

    According to United Press International, Britain is very worried that the Western attempt to seize the Suez Canal with the so-called "international control" plan will encounter strong opposition at the London conference. Other reports indicate that the Western countries are far from being united among themselves.

    There are also reports that Britain and France are also uneasy about the attitude of the United States. Eden has arranged to discuss the attitude of the United States with the foreign ministers of the three Western countries at a luncheon on the 15th. It is said that the purpose of this consultation is to "clarify the opinions of the United States" in order to strengthen the "Western front," because there are reports that the U.S. State Department has formulated a new plan regarding the future status of the canal.

    西方三国在伦敦会议前夕活动紧张
    英国担心国际管制计划会遭到强烈反对
    据新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：讨论苏彝士问题的伦敦会议明天就要开始举行了。参加会议的各国代表团已经陆续到达伦敦。在会议开幕前夕，发起这个会议的英、法、美三国正在紧张地进行活动，企图使会议能够通过所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的方案。
    英国内阁在十四日举行了会议，讨论英国在这个会议上采取的政策。刚从美国到英国的澳大利亚总理孟席斯也出席了英国内阁的这次会议，向会议报告了他最近在华盛顿同美国领袖们就苏彝士运河问题进行会谈的情况。
    同一天，英国首相艾登和外交大臣劳埃德分别同印度出席会议的代表团团长梅农进行会谈。
    法国内阁也在十四日举行了会议。会上通过了一个方案，主张设立权力广大的国际机构来管制苏彝士运河。法国内阁发言人说，法国代表团准备在十五日会议开幕前先同英国和美国的代表讨论这个方案。他还说，法国希望这个方案会成为英、法、美三国联合方案的基础。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在十四日乘飞机前往伦敦以前，曾经同副国务卿胡佛和参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在机场举行了最后一分钟的会议。此外，杜勒斯还同英国大使麦金斯以及西德大使克里克勒举行了会谈。
    据合众社说，英国很担心西方企图夺取苏彝士运河的所谓“国际管制”计划在伦敦会议上会遭到强烈的反对。其他的消息表明，西方国家相互间也远远不是一致的。
    还有消息说，英国和法国对美国的态度也感到不安。艾登已经安排好要在十五日和西方三国外长在午餐席上讨论美国的态度。据说，这次商谈的目的是“澄清美国的意见”，以加强“西方阵线”，因为有消息说，美国国务院拟订了关于运河的将来地位的新方案。
