Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Zhang Qinghe, a cook, has recently been promoted to deputy director of the Xinjin County Grain Bureau Rice Mill in Sichuan Province.

Zhang Qinghe was transferred from a rice mill in Chengdu to the Xinjin County Rice Mill in 1951. The factory had rudimentary equipment, relying on a 50-horsepower water turbine for power, and many processes required heavy manual labor. Because Zhang Qinghe was physically weak and unsuitable for heavy manual labor, he was assigned to be a cook.

From 1953 onwards, Zhang Qinghe used his spare time to study technology and experiment with manufacturing various tools to replace manual labor. With the support of the leadership and the help of the workers, he successively created automatic windmills, conveying pipes, elevators, upper-silo machines, and modified flour grinders and water inlet gates, enabling the factory to use machines instead of manpower for the entire process, from rice entering the rice mill, through the flow sieve and windmill, to the milled white rice entering the warehouse.

Due to Zhang Qinghe's creation and improvement of tools, the factory changed from a 21-person shift to a 6-person shift, creating favorable conditions for the adoption of more efficient new spiral drum and other machine parts. Currently, the processing fee at the factory where Zhang Qinghe works has been reduced from the original 15 yuan per 10,000 jin of rice to 5 yuan.

### 炊事员当了副厂长

    炊事员当了副厂长
    据新华社讯　炊事员张清和，最近被提升为四川省国营新津县粮食局碾米厂的副厂长。
    张清和是1951年从成都某碾米厂调来新津县碾米厂的。这个厂设备简陋，靠一部五十匹马力的水力机作动力，许多工序都需要繁重的体力劳动。因为张清和体质较弱，不宜作体力劳动，便被分配当炊事员。
    从1953年起，张清和便利用工作余暇钻研技术，试验制造各种工具来代替人力。在领导方面的支持和工人们的帮助之下，他先后创制成功自动风车、输送管、升降机、上仓机和改装了面磨、进水门等工具，使这个厂从稻谷进入碾米机，经过流筛、风车，直到碾成的白米入仓，完全用机器代替了人力。
    由于张清和的创造和改进工具，这个厂由二十一人一班工作，改为六人一班，为采用效率较高的新式螺旋滚筒等机件创造了有利条件。现在，张清和所在工厂的加工费，已经由原来每万斤稻谷十五元降低为五元。
