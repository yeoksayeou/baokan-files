Response to Criticism

    Wuhan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation
    Comprehensively Strengthens Heatstroke Prevention Work
    A letter from the Wuhan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation states: "On July 11th, the People's Daily published a critical article entitled 'Heatstroke Prevention Work Needs to Be Strengthened at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works Construction Site.' We believe this criticism is entirely correct. The reason for the inadequate heatstroke prevention work is mainly that the company's leaders lack a strong mass perspective and have not regarded heatstroke prevention and cooling measures as important measures to complete production tasks. Although instructions for heatstroke prevention and cooling work were issued in May, a meeting was not held for deployment until June, and the deployment was neither comprehensive nor specific. In particular, the funding issue was not specifically resolved, and there was no serious supervision or inspection, which caused the heatstroke prevention and cooling work to be delayed and progress was not made. After seeing the criticism of our company in the newspaper on July 11th, the Party Committee held an emergency meeting that evening, took emergency measures, and organized responsible comrades from the Party, administration, and trade union, as well as relevant section chiefs, to inspect the construction sites of various engineering companies, construction site hospitals, staff dormitories, and canteens on the 12th and 13th. Based on different situations and priorities, funds were allocated and the masses were mobilized to find ways to solve the heatstroke prevention and cooling problems."

    As of the beginning of August, the corporation had allocated more than 200,000 yuan to various units to purchase heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment. To ensure that employees get adequate rest, more than 3,000 square meters of reed mat sheds and 50 canvas sunshades have been built. Loans of 60,000 yuan have been provided to some employees who have financial difficulties and cannot afford mosquito nets. Currently, the vast majority of employees have purchased new mosquito nets. Iron kettles have been issued to automobile drivers and workers operating excavators and cranes. Windows and doors have been added to fixed production units and workshops, and more than 200 table fans and ceiling fans have been purchased. Electric fans have been installed on excavators and in public places such as offices, canteens, cinemas, clubs, and kindergartens and barber shops. Tea stations have been set up at each construction site, and workers can now drink cool beverages (such as salt soda and mung bean soup, and cooling agents). All workers have been issued new straw hats. Laborers originally received a pair of straw sandals every half month, but now they receive a pair every ten days; those who originally wore canvas work clothes have all been changed to poplin work clothes. In terms of medical and health care, a large number of heatstroke prevention medicines have been purchased and distributed to employees, and various preventive medicines have been given to employees and their families. Simple bathhouses covering more than 700 square meters have been built at the construction sites, and more than 40 large bathing pots and more than 700 bathing wooden basins have been purchased, which basically solves the problem of workers taking baths. In environmental sanitation work, a patriotic health campaign has been launched to mobilize the vast number of employees to clean indoor and outdoor environments and regularly disinfect indoor and outdoor surrounding environments and toilets. All canteens have been equipped with screen windows and screen cabinets. Working hours for office staff have been reduced to seven hours, and working hours for construction sites and workers have been reduced from nine hours to eight hours. If the temperature reaches above 110 degrees, they only work seven hours. Evening studies have been suspended, and evening meetings have been reduced to ensure that employees have sufficient sleep and rest.

    However, due to the lack of thorough planning in advance and temporary crash efforts, some materials and heatstroke prevention equipment were not purchased completely for a while, and the problems of individual units have not been completely resolved. For example, no practical and feasible methods have been devised for cooling work for high-altitude operations, scraper conveyors, bulldozers, and asphalt workers. At present, we are mobilizing technicians and employees to jointly think of ways, put forward rationalization proposals, and learn from the experience of other units to solve the problems. Another urgent problem is the shortage of medical personnel. Many construction sites do not have health stations and first-aid stations, or if they do, there are very few medical personnel. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to transfer a medical work team of 200 people to the construction site for medical work, and more than 40 people have already arrived. At the same time, we are organizing short-term training classes for non-separated first-aid personnel to take charge of the first-aid work of on-site work sections and groups in order to solve the problem of insufficient medical personnel.

### 武汉冶金化学建筑总公司  全面加强防暑工作

专栏：对批评的反应

    武汉冶金化学建筑总公司
    全面加强防暑工作
    武汉冶金化学建筑总公司来信说：七月十一日人民日报刊载了“武钢工地需要加强防暑工作”的批评稿件，我们认为这个批评是完全正确的。检查防暑工作做得不好的原因，主要是由于公司领导人员群众观点不强，没有把防暑降温工作当作完成生产任务的重要措施。五月份虽然发出了防暑降温工作的指示，但是直到六月份才开会布置，而且布置得既不全面，又不具体，特别是经费问题没有得到具体解决，也没有认真督促检查，使防暑降温工作迟滞未有进展。七月十一日看到报纸上对我公司的批评后，当天晚上召开了党委紧急会议，采取了紧急措施，并于十二、十三日组织了党、行政、工会负责同志及有关处长到各工程公司施工现场及工地医院、机关宿舍、食堂进行了检查，根据不同情况和先后缓急，分别拨款和发动群众想办法，来解决防暑降温问题。
    截至八月初止，总公司已经拨款二十多万元，给各单位购置防暑降温设备。为了保证职工得到充分的休息，已经盖了三千多平方公尺的芦席棚和五十个帆布凉棚。对一部分由于经济困难买不起蚊帐的职工，已给予了六万元的贷款，目前绝大部分职工都购置了新蚊帐。对汽车司机、驾驶挖土机、起重机的工人，都发给了铁水壶。在固定生产单位、车间都增设了门窗，购置了二百多台座扇和吊扇。在挖土机上和办公室、食堂、电影院、俱乐部、幼儿园、理发室等公共场所都安装了电扇。在各施工现场都设了茶水站，工人已能喝上清凉饮料（如盐汽水和绿豆汤、清凉剂等）。所有工人都发了新草帽。民工原来是半月发一双草鞋，现在改为十天一双；原穿帆布工作服的，一律换成洋布工作服。在医疗卫生方面，添购了大批防暑药品，发给职工，并发各种预防药品给职工及其家属服用。在施工现场搭盖了简易洗澡棚七百多平方公尺，购置了洗澡大锅四十多个、洗澡木盆七百多个，基本上解决了工人洗澡的问题。在环境卫生工作上，发动广大职工开展了爱国卫生运动，清扫室内外环境，定期对室内外周围环境及厕所进行消毒。食堂一律都安了纱窗、纱橱。机关职员工作时间改为七小时，工地及工人的工作时间由九小时改为八小时，如温度达110度以上只工作七小时，停止了业余学习，减少了业余会议，保证职工有足够的睡眠和休息时间。
    但是，由于事先没有周密的计划，临时突击，部分材料和防暑设备一时买不齐全，个别单位的问题还没有完全解决。如对高空作业、铲运机、推土机和沥青工的降温工作还没有想到切实可行的办法。目前我们正在发动技术人员和职工共同想办法，提合理化建议和学习其他单位的经验来加以解决。另一个迫切问题是医务人员不足，不少施工现场还没有保健站和急救站，或虽有而医务人员很少。中共武汉市委已决定调两百人的医疗工作队来工地进行医疗工作，现在已经来了四十多人；同时我们正在组织不脱产的急救人员短期训练班，担任现场工段、小组的急救工作，以解决医务人员不足的问题。
