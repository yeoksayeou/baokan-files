Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 20th: The Henan Province Mountain Area Work Conference, which opened on the 7th, closed on the 17th. The 431 mountain area representatives who attended the meeting earnestly discussed the "Henan Mountain Area Production Plan" (draft) and the summary report of mountain area work, both proposed by the province's leading organs.

The representatives believed that the mountain area work in the past few years has been very successful. Due to the rapid recovery and development of mountain area production, the economic and cultural lives of the mountain people and the conditions of disease medical treatment and transportation in the mountain areas have undergone great changes. The phenomenon of the whole family sharing one quilt and several people sharing one pair of pants has long disappeared. Many newly built houses have appeared everywhere. The difficulty of water use in many places has been solved. More than 200,000 residents in the entire mountain area who originally lacked water now have no problem of not having water to drink.

At the meeting, the representatives also made many criticisms of the leading organs. They believed that after the realization of cooperation, the leadership had insufficient research on the characteristics of mountain area production, and one-sidedly emphasized agricultural production, neglecting the development of the mountain area's diverse economy. For example, in the farmland water conservancy movement launched this spring, the leadership emphasized the requirement of digging wells in many mountainous areas that were not suitable for digging wells, resulting in many areas digging wells that had no water and becoming abandoned wells, causing great losses to the masses. However, leadership assistance for the development of suitable local industries such as forestry, animal husbandry, and other native products has been relaxed.

The representatives pointed out that due to the lack of comprehensive planning for the development of mountain areas, many tasks lack unified leadership, so many tasks are not organically coordinated and even conflict with each other. For example, emphasizing the development of forestry does not allow grazing; emphasizing soil and water conservation does not allow logging; emphasizing increasing the production of local specialties, but no one purchases them; similar phenomena affect the economic development of mountain areas.

The representatives put forward many suggestions for improving work at the meeting. They demanded that in the development of mountain area production, great efforts should be made in soil and water conservation, elimination of animal pests, and other pest and disease control work. The representatives pointed out that in many places, severe soil erosion has resulted in the loss of many cultivated lands, and in many areas, animal pests harm crops to the point of a "30% people, 70% animals" grain split.

The meeting studied in detail the situation of the mountain areas, the opinions and special requirements of the mountain people, and stipulated the guidelines and tasks for future mountain area work.

### 全面规划统一领导建设山区  河南省山区工作会议确定今后方针任务

    全面规划统一领导建设山区
    河南省山区工作会议确定今后方针任务
    新华社郑州20日电　河南省在七日召开的山区工作会议，已于十七日闭幕。到会的四百三十一位山区代表，在会议期间认真地讨论了本省领导机关提出的“河南山区生产规划”（草案）和山区工作总结报告。
    代表们认为，过去几年来的山区工作成绩很大。由于山区生产的迅速恢复和发展，山区人民的经济、文化生活和山区的疾病医疗、交通运输等条件，已经发生了很大的变化。过去全家伙盖一条被子、几人伙穿一条裤子的现象早已不存在了，到处出现了许多新盖的房屋。许多地方用水的困难解决了，全山区已有二十多万原先缺水吃的居民，现在不发生没有水吃的问题。
    会议上，代表们对领导机关也提出了许多批评。认为实现合作化以后领导上对于山区生产的特点研究不够，片面地强调农业生产，忽视了山区的多种经济的发展。如今年春季所开展的农田水利运动中，许多不适宜打井的山区，领导上强调要求打井，因而使许多地区打成井后没水成为废井，造成群众极大的损失。但是，对当地适宜发展的如林、牧和其他土特产的领导帮助却放松了。
    代表们指出，由于对山区的发展缺乏全面的规划，许多工作缺乏统一的领导，因而许多工作没有有机地配合起来，而且互相冲突。如强调发展林业，就不许放牧；强调水土保持就不许采伐；强调增加生产土特产，却没有人收购；类似这些现象，都影响着山区经济的发展。
    代表们在会议上提出了许多改进工作的意见。要求在发展山区生产中，要大力进行水土保持和除治兽害以及其他病虫害的工作。代表们提出了许多地方由于严重水土流失而失去了许多耕地，许多地区兽害对于农作物的危害形成为人兽“三七分粮”。
    会议详细研究了山区的情况、山区人民的意见和特殊的要求，规定了今后山区工作的方针和任务。
