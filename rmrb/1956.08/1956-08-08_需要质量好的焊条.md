    In the past, we used welding rods from Shanghai such as the "Houcheng," "Dacheng," and "Bincheng" brands. These brands of welding rods were of good quality, and even workers of lower skill levels could use them. Electric welders transferred from all over the country also liked to use them. However, since the first quarter of this year, precisely when the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base urgently needed welding rods, it has been impossible to buy these brands anywhere. In the second quarter, we couldn't buy them in Hankou, so we sent people to Shanghai to negotiate with many units and only bought a small portion, which was far from meeting our needs. Having no other choice, we had to buy some welding rods produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, but because the quality was low, the workers couldn't weld with them, which affected our work. The reason why Shanghai welding rods are not available is said to be because they are exclusively sold within Shanghai and not supplied to other places. It is hoped that Shanghai's welding rods can still be appropriately supplied to other places in need, and it is hoped that welding rod factories in other regions will learn from Shanghai's experience and improve the quality of their welding rods.

    需要质量好的焊条
    过去，我们都使用上海出品的“厚诚”、“大成”、“斌成”等牌子的电焊条。这些牌子的电焊条质量好，随便几级工都可以焊；从全国各地调来的电焊工人，也都喜欢用它。可是从今年第一季起，正是建设武汉钢铁基地急需电焊条的时候，到处都买不到这几个牌子的电焊条了。第二季度，我们在汉口买不到，特地派人跑到上海，同很多单位商量才买到一小部分，远远不能满足需要。没有办法，只得买了一些鞍钢出品的电焊条，但是因为质量较低，工人们都焊不了，影响了我们的工作。上海电焊条买不到的原因，据说是被上海包销了，不供应外地。希望上海的焊条还是能够适当供应外地需要，并希望其他地区的焊条厂学习上海的经验，提高焊条质量。
