    Random Memories of Lin'an
    Chen Jueren

    Again, it is the long summer of loud cicada song and gently swaying willow shadows. Three years ago, on days like these, I arrived in Lin'an, a place full of mountains and trees.
    Mentioning Lin'an, some may think of Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, but it is not. It is a small county town quite far from Hangzhou, requiring several hours by car from Hangzhou, passing through Liuxia Town and Yuhang County.

    After passing Yuhang County, the car gradually climbs several stretches of road, the high mountains on either side densely covered with trees and bamboo, shaded from the sky.

    Lin'an County was originally named Linshui County during the Three Kingdoms period. During the Jin Dynasty under Emperor Wu, Linshui was changed to Lin'an. During the second year of the Kai Ping era of the Five Dynasties Liang Dynasty, it was briefly renamed Anguo. The small mountain within the city is now called Anguo Mountain, beneath which lies the tomb of Qian Liu, also known as King Wusu of Wuyue. Speaking of Qian Liu, almost no one, even the locals, knows much about him today. Because I read "Second Collection of West Lake Stories," the first story being "Granny Qian Liu," I went to inquire about the so-called "Granny Liu Well," and some laughed at my bookishness, which is not surprising. The Qian Wang Temple in Hangzhou, located in "Willow Waves Listening to Orioles," has collapsed and has not been attended to for several years. Everyone believes that these are relics of feudal emperors and there is no need to preserve them. In my opinion, this is an incorrect view of ancient relics.

    Qian Liu rendered meritorious service to the people of that time. Not to mention protecting the territory and pacifying the country, reducing the ravages of war, even the stone dike built by Qian Liu on the Qiantang River, with more than ten rows of large trees planted outside the dike for layered protection, shows his great concern and efforts for the welfare of the people.

    Although Qian Liu was a military man, he possessed literary talent. When he returned to Lin'an, he drank with the elders and wrote a three-part homecoming song. The elders did not understand much of it, so he immediately changed his style and sang in the Wu dialect:

    "How happy you are to see me,
    It's a completely different feeling,
    Forever in my heart!"

    So everyone sang along with him, filled with cheers. Later, the place where they ate, drank, and sang was called "Happy Land" by the common people.

    Ten li west of Lin'an is Linglong Mountain. The road up the mountain winds and turns. On one side are steep cliffs, covered with green moss and lichen; on the other side are flying flowers and splashing snow, roaring waterfalls. Countless dense branches obscure the head, green shadows slanting across the steps. Clouds fill the mountain, making the steps slippery. Next to a small waterfall is a flat, dark ancient stone, as smooth as a bed, with five large characters engraved on it in clerical script: "Su Dongpo's Drunken Sleeping Stone." On the cliff is inscribed "Nine-Fold Rock" in Dongpo's handwriting. Further up is the "Three-Rest Pavilion," which is referred to in Dongpo's collection: "At the Three-Rest Pavilion, one can wait for the moon; before the Nine-Fold Rock, one can skillfully store the wind." In the Three-Rest Pavilion, there were originally three stone statues of Su Dongpo, Huang Shangu, and Foyin. Among them, the statues of Shangu and Foyin have their heads and waists broken, lying on the ground. It is said that a few years ago, village cadres considered them superstitious Bodhisattvas, ordered people to smash their heads, and forcibly dragged them down with thick ropes, resulting in that miserable state. Later, the county cultural and educational department sent personnel to investigate the historical sites, saying they wanted to protect them, but it was already beyond repair. The stone statues were originally relics of the Ming Dynasty, but unexpectedly they were destroyed. What a pity!

    Outside the west gate is the Lintian Bridge, a new bridge on the highway to Tianmu Mountain. The stream water rolls down from Tianmu Mountain. When the torrents from the myriad mountains converge here, they rush and roar like the huge waves of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, swirling clouds and dancing snow, "twelve times a day with wind and thunder." Even waking up occasionally in the middle of the night, one can still hear the majestic and surging sound. But when the period of mountain torrents has passed, the water recedes, revealing the sand and restoring tranquility.

    It has been two years since I left Lin'an, but these scenes still often linger in my dreams.

    临安杂忆
    陈珏人
    又是蝉声高唱，柳影轻摇的长夏了。三年前在这样的日子里，我到了到处是山也到处是树的临安。
    一提到临安，也许有人会想到就是南宋时代都城杭州，其实并不是。它是离开杭州还远的一个小县城，汽车从杭州经过留下镇和余杭县，需要好几个小时才能到达。
    过了余杭县，车渐渐要向上爬行几段路，路旁高山长满了密密层层的树木和竹子，阴翳不见天日。
    临安县，在三国时名临水县，晋武帝时改临水为临安。五代梁开平二年曾一度改名为安国。现在城内的小山名叫安国山，下面有本地人钱鏐也就是钱武肃王的坟墓。说到钱鏐，今天几乎连本地人也很少知道他的了。我因读“西湖二集”，第一篇就是“钱婆留”，便去访问所谓“婆留井”，就有人笑我书痴，这也难怪。杭州“柳浪闻莺”所在地的钱王祠坍塌了，好几年也不曾有人过问，大家认为这是封建帝王的遗迹，没有保留的必要。我看这是对古代文物的一种不正确的看法。
    钱鏐对当时人民是立过功劳的，且不说保境安邦，减少战祸，即以钱鏐在钱塘江修建的石堤，堤外又植大木十余行，层层保护，就可以见到他对人民福利事业是十分关怀和努力的了。
    钱鏐虽是武人，却有文学才能。当他回到临安的时候，和父老在一起喝酒，写了三节还乡之歌。父老多不懂，他立刻便改变作风，操着吴音高唱道：
    “你辈见侬底欢喜，
    别是一般滋味子，
    长在我侬心子里！”
    于是大家都跟他唱起来，欢声一片。后来这块吃酒唱歌的地方，就被老百姓叫做“欢喜地”。
    临安西十里有玲珑山。上山那一段路，曲曲折折盘旋而上。一面是峭壁悬崖，苍苔碧藓；一面是飞花溅雪，怒瀑轰雷。无数密密重重的树枝遮在头上，绿影横斜，泻布在一级级的石磴上。云气满山，步履湿滑。在小瀑布旁边有一块平躺着的苍黝古石，光滑得像眠床一样，上面鏐刻着五个隶书大字：“东坡醉眠石”。峭壁上刻有东坡手书“九折岩”。再上便是“三休亭”，东坡集中：“三休亭上工延月，九折岩前巧贮风”之句，即指此。三休亭内原有苏东坡、黄山谷、佛印三座石像，其中山谷、佛印的像，已头断腰折，睡在地下。据说是前几年被村干部认为是迷信的菩萨，叫人打碎他们的头颅，并用粗绳索硬拖下来，以至弄成那一副惨象的。后来县文教科派员来调查古迹，说要保护，已经无法补救了。石像原是明代遗物，不料却遭到破坏，实在可惜得很！
    西城外有临天桥，是新建通天目山公路的大桥，溪水由天目山滚滚而来，当万山丛中的洪流汇集到此，奔腾怒吼，像长江黄河的巨浪一般，卷云舞雪，“一日风雷十二时”，连半夜里偶然醒来，还听到砰訇汹涌的雄伟的声音。可是当山洪暴发的时期过了以后，水落沙明，恢复恬静。
    我离开临安已有二年了，但这些景象还常常萦绕在我的梦魂中。
