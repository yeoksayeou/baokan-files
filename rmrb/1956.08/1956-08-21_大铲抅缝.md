    Grouting with a Large Shovel

    When laying bricks, workers generally use large shovels. When applying grout, they need to switch to a grouting tool, which slows down the work efficiency. Comrade Wei Jingshan, foreman of the No. 1 Engineering Section of the Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, invented a method of grouting with a large shovel. This method involves welding an iron bar to the right side of the large shovel. After laying six to eight bricks, the side with the welded iron bar is used for vertical and horizontal grouting, and then the laying continues. Grouting while laying like this increases work efficiency by 13.85% compared to the previous method of applying grout later. When using a large shovel for grouting, the mortar must be full, which strengthens the bond between the bricks and improves the quality of the project. (Lú Rúzǐ)

    大铲抅缝
    砌砖的时候，工人们一般都使用大铲，原浆抅缝的时候需要换用抅缝器，这样工作效率就比较慢。建筑工程部直属工程公司第一工程处工长魏景山同志创造了用大铲抅缝的办法。这个办法是在大铲的右侧焊上一根铁条，在砌完六到八块砖以后，就用焊有铁条的一边进行垂直和水平的抅缝，抅完以后再砌。这样一面砌一面抅缝，比过去原浆抅缝提高工作效率13.85％。使用大铲抅缝，灰浆必须饱满，这便加强了砖和砖的粘结力，提高了工程质量。　（卢孺子）
