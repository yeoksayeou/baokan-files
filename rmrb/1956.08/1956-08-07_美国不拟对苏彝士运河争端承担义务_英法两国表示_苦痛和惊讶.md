Xinhua News Agency, August 6th, London dispatch: According to American news agencies, British and French figures felt "pain and surprise" at US Secretary of State Dulles' remarks on the US attitude towards the Suez Canal issue in a television broadcast on the 3rd. Dulles said that if the Western-proposed international conference on the Suez Canal issue fails, the United States will not "undertake any kind of obligation."

United Press International reported that London believes Dulles' words are "a serious blow to the West's 'strategic position' in its explosive dispute with President Nasser."

The report also said that Allied diplomats expressed "concern" about the US approach. They are concerned that the United States, "by revealing its position prematurely, has weakened the Western front in the most critical stage of the 'war of nerves' against Egypt"; they are also concerned about the "lack of unity among Western countries." This concern has been increased by the United States' decision on paying canal tolls to Egypt and news that the United States is reportedly easing the freeze on Egyptian assets.

    美国不拟对苏彝士运河争端承担义务
    英法两国表示“苦痛和惊讶”
    据新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：据美国通讯社报道，英国和法国人士对美国国务卿杜勒斯三日在电视广播演说中谈到美国对苏彝士运河问题的态度的那番话感到“苦痛和惊讶”。杜勒斯说，如果西方拟议的关于苏彝士运河问题的国际会议失败，美国将不“承担任何种类的义务”。
    合众社消息说，伦敦认为，杜勒斯的话“是对西方在其同纳赛尔总统的爆炸性纠纷中的‘策略地位’的一个严重打击”。
    消息还说，盟国的外交家们对美国的作法表示“担心”。他们担心，美国“过早地透露它的立场，已经削弱了对埃及进行‘神经战’的最紧要阶段中的西方阵线”；他们还担心，“西方国家缺乏团结”。而美国关于向埃及缴纳运河通行费的决定以及据说美国要放松对埃及资产的冻结的消息，更加增加了这种担心。
