The Voices of Readers in Liuzhou

Hoping Our City Can Be a Little Cleaner

To the Editorial Comrade:

Liuzhou is one of the four major cities in Guangxi Province, with a population of approximately 170,000. Like other cities across the country, it is advancing towards socialism at a tremendous pace. However, it is regrettable that it is one of the least clean cities.

Is it a Market or a Horse Farm?

The Hebei Commercial Center in Liuzhou City is located in the center of Hebei District, with the Municipal People's Committee located just across a small alley to its right. In front is the Liuzhou City Library, and the surroundings are residential buildings and offices. Strangely, in the center of this commercial center, there are two large sheds where dozens of horses and carriages are tethered and parked day and night. Not only does the neighing of the horses prevent people from being quiet, but the smell of horse manure and urine is overwhelming. Even when people drink tea in the tea house of the commercial center, they cannot smell the aroma of the tea. People cannot help but ask whether this is a commercial center or a horse farm?

"Warehouses" Under the Arcades

Many main streets in Liuzhou City, such as Xiaonan Road and Xingren East Road, are often filled with things under the arcades on both sides, especially at the entrances of trade departments, where goods and bamboo baskets are often placed, turning the arcades (sidewalks) into temporary warehouses, even occupying the roads. As a result, people cannot walk on the sidewalks that can provide shelter from the rain on rainy days. The sidewalks on other streets are also very unclean, with snack stalls scattered everywhere, and some residents even move their water tanks and stoves to the side of the sidewalks.

A Zoo You Can Only Pass By Holding Your Nose

The only tourist attraction in Hebei District of Liuzhou City is the zoo in Liuhou Park, which contains tigers, bears, and birds. Not only is the zoo small, but the worst thing is that it is often not cleaned, and the feces and urine of the animals and the leftover food emit a strong, pungent smell that makes people want to vomit. The people of Liuzhou do not welcome this zoo. Tourists from other places also want to see these animals, but can only pass by holding their noses, leaving a bad impression.

The Only Flaw of Fish Peak Mountain

Fish Peak Mountain is one of the eight scenic spots in Liuzhou City. This place is surrounded by towering ancient trees, with green shade in spring and summer, making it a beautiful scenic spot. On weekdays, people come here to rest in a constant stream, and every holiday, the tea houses at the foot of the mountain and under the trees on the mountain are filled with workers, staff, and their families from factories and offices. However, there is no proper toilet at the foot of the mountain, and there are no lights at night, so tourists defecate everywhere. After the scorching sun, the south wind blows, and the stench is overwhelming, which is truly a flaw.

Many Manure Buckets on the Streets

This year, the suburbs have achieved agricultural collectivization, and the members are constantly bringing manure into the city as fertilizer to increase production, which is naturally understandable. However, the members do not have a fixed time to bring manure into the city. Whether it is a weekday or a holiday, there are farmers carrying manure from morning to afternoon. Some farmers are busy buying things after entering the city, and they leave their manure buckets scattered all over the streets and alleys. Some manure buckets have no lids, and flies are swarming above them. This is really detrimental to the appearance and hygiene of the city. The Liuzhou Daily and the Guangxi Daily raised the issue of correcting this phenomenon a long time ago, but it has not been corrected yet.

"Street Soccer Team"

I'm afraid everyone has seen the movie "Street Soccer Team"! The situation in Liuzhou City is no less than that depicted in the movie. Groups of children often play soccer on the streets, and sometimes a ball soaked in sewage will hit pedestrians with a "bang," and cyclists must be especially "vigilant," otherwise "accidents" will occur in which these "child athletes" are injured.

We believe that as long as the relevant municipal departments do not let things drift but strengthen their leadership over sanitation work and the management of urban order, Liuzhou can become cleaner.

### 柳州读者的呼声  希望我们的城市整洁一点

    柳州读者的呼声
    希望我们的城市整洁一点编辑同志：
    柳州市是广西省四大城市之一，人口约有十七万。这个城市和全国其他城市一样正在一日千里地向社会主义跃进。但令人遗憾的是，它是一个最不整洁的城市。
    是商场还是养马场
    柳州市河北商场在河北区的中心，右边隔一条小巷便是市人民委员会所在地，前面是柳州市图书馆，周围是住宅和机关宿舍。奇怪的是，在这个商场的中枢有两座大凉棚，下面日夜拴着和停放着数以十计的马匹和马车。不但马的嘶叫声使人不能安静，而且马粪、马尿臭味逼人。甚至人们在商场的茶社里喝茶，也闻不出茶的香味。人们不得不问这里是商场，还是养马场呢？
    骑楼下的“仓库”
    柳州市很多主要街道，如小南路、兴仁东路等两侧骑楼底下，经常堆满东西，尤其是贸易部门的门口，常摆着商品、竹筐，把骑楼底（人行道）当做临时仓库，甚至横占到马路上来。以致雨天，人们也不能走可以遮雨的人行道。其他街道的人行道也很不整洁，零食担到处乱摆，有些居民把水缸、炉灶也都搬到人行道旁来了。
    只能掩鼻而过的动物园
    柳州市河北区唯一游览地—柳侯公园的动物园，里面有老虎、狗熊和飞禽等。这个动物园的地方窄小且不说它，最糟的是经常无人打扫，兽类的粪尿和吃剩的食物发出一股股浓烈的腥臭味，闻之欲呕。柳州人就很不欢迎这个动物园。外地来的旅客，也想看看这些动物，但只能掩鼻而过，印象当然不佳。
    鱼峰山美中不足
    鱼峰山是柳州市八景之一，这个地方环山是参天古树，春、夏绿叶成荫，是一个风景幽美的地方。平日间到这里休息的人们川流不息，每到假日，山底下的茶社和山上树下到处是从工厂、机关来的工人、职员和他们的家属。但是山下没有一个适当的厕所，晚上没有灯光，游人随处便溺，烈日晒后，南风吹来，臭气冲鼻，真是美中不足。
    街头粪桶多
    今年郊区实现了农业合作化，社员为了增产，源源不断地进城挑大粪做肥料，这自然无可厚非。但是社员进城挑粪没有一定时间，不论平日或假日，从早上到下午，都有农民挑粪。有些农民进城后，忙着买东西，把粪桶在街头巷尾到处乱放。有的粪桶没有盖，苍蝇便成群地在上面飞舞。这实在有碍城市的观瞻和卫生，柳州日报和广西日报很早就提出应该纠正这种现象，可是现在还没有纠正。
    “街上足球队”
    大家恐怕都看过“街上足球队”这部电影吧！柳州市的情况并不逊于电影里所描绘的。成群的孩子经常在街上踢足球，有时浸透了污水的球会“砰”的一声打到行人身上，骑自行车的更要特别提高“警惕”，不然就会发生撞伤这些“儿童运动员”的“事故”。
    我们认为只要市的有关部门不是听其自流而是加强对卫生工作的领导，加强对城市秩序的管理，柳州是可以变得整洁起来的。
