    London, August 20th (Reported by our correspondent) – The London Conference resumed this afternoon at 3:00 PM, after adjourning for one day on August 19th. The August 20th meeting was held under the following circumstances: First, most countries had expressed their attitudes on the Suez Canal issue, and the two different lines in the conference had become very clear. Second, Dulles' draft declaration did not receive the expected response.
    Today's meeting was delayed by 45 minutes because the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held an emergency meeting beforehand. Prior to this, Dulles had met separately with representatives from Turkey, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, and Italy.
    All indications suggest that the conference has entered a decisive stage.
    At today's meeting, Dulles actively peddled his draft. The basis of this draft is to implement international co-management of the Suez Canal. According to well-informed sources, Dulles' efforts have not changed his situation. An influential newspaper here wrote that if a vote on Dulles' plan were taken prematurely, it could lead to a split in the conference.

    伦敦会议进入了决定性阶段
    本报伦敦20日电　伦敦会议在八月十九日休会一日后，今日下午三点又继续进行。二十日的会议，是在这样的情况下举行的：一、大部分的国家，都已表示过对苏彝士运河问题的态度，会议中两条不同的路线，已十分分明。二、杜勒斯散发的宣言草案，没有得到预期的反应。
    今日的会议，迟开了四十五分钟，因为美英法三国外长在会前举行了紧急会谈。在此以前，杜勒斯曾分别会见了土耳其、丹麦、瑞士、挪威和意大利的代表。
    种种迹象表明，会议已进入决定性阶段。
    在今日会议上，杜勒斯积极兜售他的草案。这个草案的基础，是对苏彝士运河实行国际共管。据消息灵通人士谈，杜勒斯的努力，并没有改变他的处境。此间一家有影响的报纸曾经写道：如果对杜勒斯的计划过早地进行表决，可能招致会议的分裂。
