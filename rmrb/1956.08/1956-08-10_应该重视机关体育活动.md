    Importance Should Be Attached to Physical Activities in Government Offices
    To the Editor:
    We work at the Cangxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province. We don't even have a set of horizontal or parallel bars here. People have to do pull-ups on door frames and walls; high jump and long jump are done in a yard less than five meters wide. It is impossible to find a place to play volleyball. The County Committee originally had a decent-looking court, but after a few days it was occupied by the distillery and filled with distiller's grains, horse manure, and cinders.
    People have repeatedly suggested to the administrative leaders that they solve the problem of necessary sports equipment, but they always say "financial difficulties" and ignore it for a long time. It has also been suggested that the Party branch strengthen its leadership over this work, but no one has ever paid attention to it. Yes, "expenses" are difficult, and the leadership is also busy with work, but this is a major issue related to the health of comrades. As long as we find a way and mobilize the masses, we can do more with less money. The problem is to strengthen leadership and not to be too negligent.

### 应该重视机关体育活动

    应该重视机关体育活动编辑同志：
    我们在中共河北省沧县地委机关工作。我们这里连一付单双杠也没有，人们只好在门框上、墙壁上作引体向上的动作；在一个长宽不及五公尺的院里跳高、跳远；要打打排球也找不到地方。地委会原来有一处很像样的球场，不过没过几天就给酒厂占据了，满满地堆积着糟糠、马粪和煤渣。
    人们曾一再建议行政领导给解决一些必要的体育设备，但是总是说“经费困难”而长期不理。也曾建议党支部加强对这一工作的领导，但始终也是没人过问。是的，“开支”是困难的，领导方面工作也是忙的，但这是关系到同志们健康的大事，只要想办法，发动群众是可以少花钱多办事的。问题是要加强领导，不要过于忽视。
