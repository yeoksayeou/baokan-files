Which Radio is Good, Which Radio is Bad?

The Model 504 five-tube AC radio has better performance. The sound is clear, the parts are assembled firmly, it is not prone to failure, and the style is compact. Compared with other radios, this radio is also relatively inexpensive.

The "Peace Brand" four-tube radio with a record player can perform the function of a five-tube radio. It produces a relatively loud sound even with weaker radio waves. This radio has a record player and can play records.

The "Dongfanghong" (East is Red) seven-tube AC radio has good performance, clear sound, and a solid parts structure. It is a high-end radio with a beautiful style.

The above-mentioned radios also have shortcomings. The main problem is that some parts do not meet standards and need further quality improvement.

The "Beijing Brand" four-tube AC radio generally has relatively good performance, a simple structure, and a relatively low price. However, the internal wiring of this radio is relatively messy, easily affected by moisture, and interferes with listening. Some of these radios have noise or even fail to work due to poor potentiometer quality. If these shortcomings can be quickly overcome, it will also be a better radio.

The Model 205 two-tube long-wave AC radio and the three-tube AC radio produced in Tianjin are of very poor quality. Their parts are very rough and do not meet standards, requiring rapid improvement.

    哪种收音机好，哪种收音机不好？
    504型五灯交流收音机性能比较好。声音清晰，零件的装配牢固，不容易发生故障，式样小巧。这种收音机和其他的收音机比较起来，价格也比较低廉。
    “和平牌”四灯带唱盘收音机可以起到五灯收音机的作用，在较弱的电波下，发出的声音也比较大。这种收音机有唱盘，可以放唱片。
    “东方红”七灯交流收音机性能好，声音清晰，零件结构牢固，是一种高级的收音机，式样也很美观。
    上述这几种收音机也有缺点。主要是部分零件还不合标准，需要进一步提高质量。
    “北京牌”四灯交流收音机的性能一般还比较好，结构简单，价格也比较低。但是这种收音机内部线路的排列比较乱，容易受潮，妨碍收听。这种收音机有的因为电位器质量不好，收听的时候有杂音，甚至不响。这些缺点如能迅速克服，它也将是一种较好的收音机。
    205型两灯长波交流收音机和天津生产的三灯交流收音机，质量都很差。它们的零件很粗糙，而且不合标准，需要迅速改进。
