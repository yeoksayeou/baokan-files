    The Difficulties of College Students
    Wang Wang
    Once, during a "History of Chinese Literature" class, the teacher told us: "When you answer questions, you must have some original thought to get a full score. However, you must first answer according to what I taught. If you have different opinions from what I taught, you can elaborate as much as possible after answering. Of course, you must also be careful not to elaborate incorrectly." After class, everyone asked: "What exactly does the teacher mean by what he said in class today about the exam questions?"
    There was a classmate who was always very interested in literary theory. He studied hard in this area, and many classmates felt that his understanding in this area was relatively correct. When it came time to take the "Introduction to Literary Theory" exam, the question he drew was: "The writer is the engineer of the human soul." He was very happy and integrated what the professor taught with his own insights, giving a creative answer. The professor sat opposite him with his eyes closed, listening. After listening, he said: "Where did you copy this stuff from? Didn't you take notes on what I said? I'll give you a 3!" Walking out of the exam room, he muttered to himself: "No matter what score I get, at least I got the chance to express my own understanding."
    Once, we had a classroom discussion on "Political Economy." When discussing the process of socialist reproduction (reproduction of social products, reproduction of labor power, reproduction of production relations), the teacher asked: "Tell me, which aspect of these three is more important? This is Marxism-Leninism, you can't just elaborate randomly!" Oh dear! The teacher didn't mention this in class! Everyone had to "elaborate." Some said this aspect was important, some said that aspect was important, each with their own reasons, and they couldn't agree. So the teacher said: "Actually, the reproduction of social products is the most important." The teacher then talked for a long time about the reasons, but he himself felt that his reasons were not sufficient, so he added: "Don't look at anything else, just look at the order in the textbook, the reproduction of social products is also before the reproduction of labor power." This problem was thus "solved."
    One evening, many of us in the class gathered together to talk about teaching problems, and we all had a common feeling: it's not easy to be a college student!

    大学生的难处
    王亡
    有一次上“中国文学史”课时，老师对我们说：“你们回答问题时，必须有发挥，才能得到五分。但是，你们必须先按照我讲的来回答。你们对我讲的如有不同意见，可以在回答完了后尽量发挥。当然，你们同时得注意不要发挥错了。”下课后，大家纷纷询问：“老师今天在课堂上谈的我们考试的问题，意思究竟是什么？”
    有一位同学，他一向对文艺理论很感兴趣，这方面的学习很努力，很多同学觉得他在这方面的认识比较正确。等到考“文艺学引论”时，他抽到的题目是：“作家是人类灵魂工程师”。他非常高兴，把教授所讲的和自己的见解融会起来，作了创造性的答复。教授闭着眼睛坐在他对面听，听完后说道：“你这一套东西是从哪儿搬来的？我讲的你没有用笔记下来是不是？给你三分！”他走出考场，自言自语地说：“不管考几分，我到底得到了发挥自己认识的机会。”
    一次，我们进行“政治经济学”课堂讨论。当讨论到社会主义再生产过程（社会产品的再生产，劳动力的再生产，生产关系的再生产）时，老师问道：“你们说说，这三方面的再生产哪方面重要？这是马克思列宁主义，你们可不能乱发挥！”啊呀！这一点，老师在课堂上可没有讲过呢！大家只得“发挥”起来，有的说这方面重要，有的说那方面重要，各有理由，相持不下。于是老师说了：“其实是社会产品的再生产重要。”老师接着说了半天理由，但他自己也觉得自己的理由实在不够充分，就补充说：“你们不要看别的，就看教科书上排列的次序吧，也是社会产品的再生产在前，劳动力的再生产在后。”这个问题这样就算“解决”了。
    有一天晚上，我们班好多同学聚在一起谈到教学上的问题时，都有一个共同的感觉：做个大学生多么不容易啊！
