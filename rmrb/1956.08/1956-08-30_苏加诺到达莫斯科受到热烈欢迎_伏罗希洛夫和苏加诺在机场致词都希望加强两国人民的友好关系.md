Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th: President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia and his entourage arrived in Moscow on the afternoon of the 28th at the invitation of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

President Sukarno arrived at the Central Airport aboard a twin-engine Ilyushin aircraft escorted by twelve jet fighters.

Upon disembarking, Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union stepped forward to greet him and introduced him to other leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government.

Voroshilov then stepped to the microphone to deliver a welcoming speech. He said that President Sukarno's visit to the Soviet Union was an outstanding event. It will help to further develop the friendly relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union, help consolidate world peace, and strengthen peaceful cooperation between countries.

Voroshilov said that the Soviet people have always expressed deep sympathy and concern for the heroic liberation struggle of the Indonesian people. We are all pleased that your motherland is now confidently advancing along the road of developing an independent national economy, and that the Indonesian government is actively pursuing a foreign policy that can make valuable contributions to world peace.

Voroshilov continued, the role of the peoples of the East has risen to an unprecedented level, which is one of the most typical facts of contemporary world history. Now, the peoples of the East have stepped onto the international stage as sovereign states and are actively participating in deciding the fate of the world. Indonesia plays a significant and active role in uniting Asian and African countries in the struggle for their independence and against colonialism and its consequences. The Soviet Union understands and supports Indonesia's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and complete independence.

In his reply speech, Sukarno said that Indonesia is still in a stage of struggle and construction. In this struggle and construction endeavor, our main goals are: first, to achieve complete political independence; and second, to build a just and prosperous society for all Indonesian people. We know that if there is no universal peace in the world, these two goals, especially the second one, are impossible to achieve. This gives rise to our third goal—to contribute to the cause of world peace.

Sukarno said that we are well aware that the various nationalities of the Soviet Union have been fighting for freedom in the past, and have always been striving to build a fair and prosperous society. The Soviet people are working with other countries to safeguard world peace.

Therefore, I am very happy to accept the invitation from Your Excellency and the Soviet government to visit the Soviet Union, and I am very pleased to take advantage of such an opportunity.

If this visit can strengthen the friendship between the Soviet people and the Indonesian people, I will be very happy and satisfied.

Finally, Sukarno and Voroshilov rode in a black convertible car towards the city center, greeted by enthusiastic crowds along the streets.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Indonesian President Sukarno paid a visit to Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 29.

    苏加诺到达莫斯科受到热烈欢迎
    伏罗希洛夫和苏加诺在机场致词都希望加强两国人民的友好关系
    新华社莫斯科29日电　印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺博士和他的随行人员，应苏联最高苏维埃主席团的邀请在28日下午到达莫斯科。
    苏加诺总统乘一架双引擎伊柳辛式飞机在十二架喷气式战斗机的护送下到达中央飞机场。
    在下机的时候，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫走上前去迎接他，并且把他介绍给苏联共产党和政府的其他领导人。
    伏罗希洛夫接着走到扩音器前面致欢迎词。他说，苏加诺总统这次到苏联访问是一件突出的事件。它将有助于进一步发展印度尼西亚和苏联之间的友好关系，有助于巩固世界和平和加强各国的和平合作。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联人民对印度尼西亚人民所进行的英勇的解放斗争始终表示深切的同情和关怀。我们大家感到高兴的是，现在你们的祖国正在满怀信心地沿着发展独立的民族经济的道路前进，而印度尼西亚政府正在积极地执行能够为世界和平作出宝贵贡献的外交政策。
    伏罗希洛夫接着说，东方各国人民的作用空前提高，这是当代有全世界历史意义的最典型的事实之一。现在，东方各国人民作为主权国家走上国际舞台，并且在积极参加决定全世界的命运。印度尼西亚在团结亚非各国争取它们的独立和反对殖民主义及其后果的斗争中起有重大的和积极的作用。苏联很了解并且支持印度尼西亚为保障领土完整和完全独立而进行的努力。
    苏加诺在致答词的时候说，印度尼西亚现在仍然处在斗争和建设的阶段。在这一斗争和这一建设事业中，我们的主要目的是：第一，达到政治上的完全独立；第二，为全体印度尼西亚人民建立一个公正而繁荣的社会。我们知道，如果世界上没有普遍和平，这两个目的，特别是第二个目的是不可能实现的。这里就产生了我们的第三个目的——为保障世界和平事业作出贡献。
    苏加诺说，我们很清楚，苏联各族人民过去一直在为自由而奋斗，过去和现在始终为建立公平的和繁荣的社会而奋斗。苏联人民正在同其他国家共同努力来保障世界和平。
    因此，我十分高兴地接受了阁下以及苏联政府的邀请前来访问苏联，并且很愉快地利用这样一个机会。
    如果这次访问之后，苏联人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊能够得到加强，那我将十分高兴和满意。
    最后，苏加诺和伏罗希洛夫乘黑色敞篷汽车驶向市中心区，沿途受到街道两旁的热情的群众的欢迎。
