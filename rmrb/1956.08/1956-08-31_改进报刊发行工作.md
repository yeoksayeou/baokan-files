    Improving Newspaper and Magazine Distribution
    Editor's Note: Recently, many readers have written to reflect that some post offices have many shortcomings in the distribution of newspapers and magazines, causing many difficulties for readers. It is hoped that post offices in various places will improve newspaper subscription procedures, carry out newspaper retail sales in cities and along transportation lines, and that subscription methods should be as convenient as possible for readers, taking into account the needs of many special circumstances.
      
      Unable to Receive Subscriptions Promptly
    Our Second Survey Team of the Chengdu Hydropower Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry subscribed to the People's Daily, Sichuan Daily, Chongqing Daily, and some magazines from the Bikou Town Business Office of the Wenxian County Post Office in Gansu Province in mid-May. At that time, we requested that the newspapers be delivered from June. The Bikou Town Business Office said that the People's Daily and magazines could start from June, and other newspapers from July. We had no choice but to agree with their opinion. After completing the subscription procedures, we looked forward to the newspapers arriving as scheduled, but we did not receive two large rolls of part of the People's Daily from June and a small amount of magazines until August 2. Other newspapers were not received. According to transportation conditions, the People's Daily and Chongqing Daily can arrive in eight days, and the Sichuan Daily can arrive in seven days. I don't know why the newspapers and magazines we ordered were delayed for so long? I hope the Bikou Town Business Office of the Wenxian County Post Office will check how they are serving the readers.

      Subscription Start and End Dates Too Rigid
    Our Xiamen Daily wanted to increase our subscription to the People's Daily due to work needs. We went to the Xiamen Post and Telecommunications Bureau on March 22nd, but the delivery could only start on April 6th. The postal distance from Xiamen to Shanghai is only four or five days. Why does it take more than ten days to see the newspaper? It is said that it is because the deadline for subscriptions and the start date for newspapers stipulated by the post office have passed.
    I think it is unreasonable for the post office to rigidly stipulate "subscription deadlines" and "start dates" for readers when accepting newspaper subscriptions.

      Unable to Afford Quarterly Subscriptions
    In the past, the People's Daily was subscribed to on a monthly basis, so readers did not have financial difficulties. I don't know why, starting from the third quarter of this year, the Changshan Island Post Office in Shandong Province insisted on subscribing for one quarter at a time. If you want to subscribe for one month, you can only subscribe for the last month of the quarter. If you subscribe in the middle of the quarter, you have to subscribe until the end of the quarter. In short, if you want to subscribe, you have to subscribe until the end of the quarter. This method can reduce the trouble for postal workers and has its "superiority," but it increases the difficulties for readers. As for me, it is indeed difficult to take out a lot of money at once. I hope to change this system immediately.

    Why Must Daily Newspapers Be Subscribed to Monthly?
    I am a student in Beijing. After the summer vacation, I went to the Chongwai Huashi Street Post Office to subscribe to the People's Daily. Because I will return to school on August 25th, I can only subscribe to the newspaper until August 25th, but the post office refused to accept the subscription because I could not subscribe to the end of the month. I don't understand, since the People's Daily is a "daily newspaper," why must readers be forced to subscribe on a monthly basis in any situation, and not be able to subscribe for a short period of time according to the needs of the readers? Later, because it was too inconvenient to buy newspapers every day, I subscribed to a short-term People's Daily from a newspaper vendor I didn't know. Why can newspaper vendors provide convenience to readers, but our national distribution agency is so mechanical?
                                                       Li Xing

      Cannot Subscribe, Cannot Buy
    I am a student at Harbin Institute of Technology and was assigned to Dalian for an internship during the summer vacation. I wanted to read the People's Daily during the internship, but I couldn't see it. I went to the Dalian Post Office to subscribe, but they would not let me subscribe for less than a month. When I tried to buy individual copies, I didn't buy a single copy of the People's Daily during my three-week internship in Dalian. This is very inconvenient for us. It is recommended that post offices guarantee a certain retail quantity of the People's Daily in cities or major places across the country.
                                                        Li Hengxi

      Change the Time for Collecting Newspaper Fees
    Newspaper fees are collected at the end of the month, but our salaries are paid at the beginning of the month. Often, we don't have money to pay the newspaper fee at the end of the month, so the post office stops delivering the newspaper. In this way, I have to buy a few individual copies to read at the beginning of each month, and then subscribe again after I get paid. But sometimes it is inconvenient to buy individual copies, so I can't read the newspaper. As far as I know, this situation is not isolated. If the post office is more flexible in the fee collection system and combines it with our salary payment time to collect newspaper fees, both the post office and the readers can save a lot of unnecessary trouble.
                                                        Li Jiang

    Difficult for People with Mobile Jobs to Read Newspapers
    Our drilling team, which has been engaged in engineering geological survey work for a long time, can never see newspapers whenever we go to a new construction site for surveying. We can't subscribe to newspapers at the post office. The post office distributors say: "Newspapers must be subscribed for in the first half of the month." Our work is very mobile. The longest time we stay at a construction site is no more than a month, and the shortest is only ten days or so. How can we subscribe half a month in advance?
    We have said many nice things to the comrades in the post office and explained our special circumstances to them, but it was all in vain. It is hoped that the comrades in charge of distributing newspapers and magazines in various places will provide convenience to our highly mobile geological drilling teams when implementing the system, so that we will not be unable to see newspapers for a long time.

    Unable to Receive Newspapers When Transferred
    In March of this year, when I was working in Yangjiang County, Guangdong, I subscribed to the People's Daily, Southern Daily, Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, Liberation Army Daily, and Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper for the second quarter from the Yangjiang Post Office. In April, due to work needs, I was transferred to work in Taishan County. Before leaving Yangjiang, I went to the post office to complete the newspaper subscription transfer procedures. However, I did not receive the newspaper for more than half a month after arriving in Taishan, and I did not receive a pile of outdated old newspapers until the end of the month.
    Leaving that aside, in June, the six newspapers suddenly stopped, and even the shadow could not be seen. According to the Taishan Post Office, Yangjiang County did not transfer the June newspapers. We repeatedly asked the Taishan Post Office to urge the Yangjiang Post Office to transfer them, but the urging was ineffective. From June 1st to June 30th, we never saw the newspapers.
    Whose responsibility is it, the Yangjiang Post Office or the Taishan Post Office? We are not clear, but it is a common phenomenon that subscribed newspapers and magazines cannot be transferred after completing the transfer procedures when being transferred. It is hoped that the post office will pay attention to this issue.

      Why No Newspaper Delivery on Sundays?
    In Laiyang County, Shandong, newspapers are often not seen on Sundays. I have called the Laiyang Post and Telecommunications Bureau three times and have not received a clear answer. In the fourth phone call, after repeated questioning, they said: "There is no newspaper delivery on Sundays. This is stipulated by the higher authorities." I don't know if the higher authorities really have this regulation. Do we not need to read newspapers on Sundays?
　　                                                 Li Hongyu

      Even More Difficult to Read Newspapers Abroad
    I am a student studying in the Soviet Union in Leningrad. In early June of this year, I went to the Leningrad City Post Office to subscribe to the "People's Daily" for the second half of the year, but they refused to accept the subscription. It is said that because China and the Soviet Union have signed a new agreement, newspapers and magazines can only be subscribed to at the end of each year. I think it is unreasonable for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to take this measure suddenly without prior notice, making it impossible for us to see newspapers. Now, 2,000 to 3,000 students from our country come to the Soviet Union to study every year. According to this agreement, they will not have Chinese newspapers to read for four months, which is a very serious situation. Moreover, the transportation time of newspapers and magazines on the road is also too long. For example, the "Study" magazine is published on the 2nd of each month, but we do not receive it until the 6th or 7th of the following month, taking more than 30 days on the road. It is hoped that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will improve the distribution of newspapers and magazines abroad so that we can see the newspapers and magazines of our motherland in a timely manner.

### 改进报刊发行工作

专栏：读者来信

    改进报刊发行工作
    编者按：最近有不少读者来信反映有些邮局在报刊发行工作中存在许多缺点，给读者造成不少困难。希望各地邮局改善订报手续，开展在城市和交通线上的报纸零售工作，预订办法也要尽可能便利读者，照顾许多特殊情况的要求。
      订报迟迟收不到
    我们电力工业部成都水电设计院第二普查队，五月中旬向甘肃省文县邮局碧口镇营业处订阅人民日报、四川日报、重庆日报及一些杂志，我们当时要求从六月份起送报。碧口镇营业处说，人民日报和杂志可以从六月份起，其他报纸从七月份起。我们无法，只好同意了他们的意见。办理订阅手续后，我们就盼望着报纸如期到来，但是，直到八月二日，我们才收到两大卷六月份的一部分人民日报，和少量杂志，其他的报纸都没有收到。按交通条件，人民日报、重庆日报八天可到，四川日报七天可到，不知为什么我们订的报纸和杂志延误这么久？希望文县邮局碧口镇营业处检查一下他们是怎样为读者服务的。
                          张轩驰
      订报起截日期太死
    我们厦门日报社因工作需要，想增订一份人民日报，三月廿二日到厦门邮电局去订，四月六日才能起送，厦门到上海的邮程只有四、五天，为什么订报却要十多天以后才能看到报呢？据说是因为过了邮局规定的截订期和起报期。
    邮局对收订报纸，这样硬性地给读者规定“截订期”、“起报期”，我认为是不合理的。　黄嘉荫
      按季订报订不起
    过去订阅人民日报是一个月一个月预订的，这样读者在经济上并不发生困难。不知为什么从今年第三季度起，山东长山岛邮局非要一次订一季不可，要想预订一个月的，就只能订季度的最后一个月，如果从当中破季订阅，也得订到季底。总之要订就要你订到季底。这种办法，可以减少邮政人员的麻烦，有它的“优越性”，但是却给读者增加了困难。拿我来说，一下子拿出很多钱来，确有困难，希望立即改变这种制度。
                          于忠田
    日报为什么要按月订
    我是北京市的一个学生，放暑假后到崇外花市大街邮局订人民日报，因为8月25日就要回学校去，所以只能将报纸订到8月25日，但邮局因我不能订到月底而拒绝收订。我不明白，人民日报既是“日报”，为什么不管在任何情况之下，都要强迫读者按月订，而不能根据读者的需要订短期的呢？后来因为每天零买报纸太不方便，我在一位素不相识的私人卖报的报贩处订阅到短期的人民日报。为什么报贩能给读者以方便，而我们国家的发行机构却如此机械呢？　黎　星
      订不到，买不到
    我是哈尔滨工业大学的学生，暑假里被分配到大连去实习。实习中想看人民日报，却看不到。到大连邮局去订，不满一个月他们不让订。买零报吧，我在大连实习三个星期就没有买到一份人民日报。这对我们很不方便，建议邮局在全国各地城市或主要地方应保证有一定零售数量的人民日报。　李亨禧
      改变收报费的时间
    订报纸，都在月底收报费，而我们的薪金，是在月初发的，往往到月底没有钱交报费，邮局就把报纸给停了。这样，每月初我就只好买几天零报看，等到发薪后再订。但有时买零报不方便，就看不到报纸。据我所知道的，这种情况并不是个别的，如果邮局在收费制度上灵活一点，结合我们的发薪时间来收报费，邮局和读者双方都可省去很多不必要的麻烦。　李　江
    工作流动的人看报难
    我们长期在外搞工程地质勘测工作的钻探队，每当新到一个工地去勘测时，总是看不到报纸；到邮局去订又订不上。邮局发行员说：“订报必须在前半个月预订”。而我们的工作流动性很大，在一个工地逗留的时间最长也不过一个多月，短的只有十几天，哪能提前半个月预订呢？
    我们向邮局工作同志说过许多好话，向他们说明我们的特殊情况，都白费。希望各地邮局负责发行报刊的同志，在执行制度时，给我们流动性很大的地质钻探队以方便，使我们不致于长期看不到报纸。
　张应亮
    调动工作，收不到报纸
    今年三月间，我在广东阳江县工作时，曾向阳江邮局订阅第二季度的人民日报、南方日报、工人日报、中国青年报、解放军报和中苏友好报各一份。四月份因工作需要，我被调到台山县城工作，未离阳江前曾到邮局办理了订报转移手续。可是到台山后半个多月，仍未收到报纸，直至月底才收到一叠过了时间的旧报纸。
    这且不说，到了六月份，六种报纸忽然中断了，连影子都看不见。据台山邮局说是阳江县没有把六月份的报纸转来，我们就几次请台山邮局代催阳江邮局转来，可是催了也不生效，从6月1日到6月30日始终没看见报纸。
    究竟是阳江邮局的责任呢？还是台山邮局的责任呢？我们不清楚，但调动工作，订阅的报刊办了转移手续却转不到是普遍现象，希望邮局注意这个问题。　韩宏民
      为啥星期日不送报
    在山东莱阳县城，星期日经常看不到报纸。我曾在电话上向莱阳邮电局问过三次，都没得到明确的答复；在第四次电话中一再追问，他们才说：“星期天不送报，这是上级规定的。”我不知道上级是否真有这个规定，难道星期日就不需要看报纸吗？　　李洪玉
      国外看报更加难
    我是在列宁格勒读书的留苏学生，今年六月初，到列宁格勒市邮政总局去订下半年的“人民日报”，但他们拒绝收订。据说是因为我国和苏联订了新的协定，报章杂志每年只能在年底预订。我觉得邮电部事先不通知，突然采取这种措施，使我们不能看到报纸，这是很不合理的。现在每年八、九月间我国有二、三千学生来苏联学习，按照这个协定，他们要有四个月没有中文报纸看，这是很严重的情况。而且，报纸杂志在路上运输的时间也太长，例如“学习”杂志每月二日出版，但我们到下月六、七日才收到，路上一共要走三十多天。希望邮电部改进国外报刊的发行工作，让我们能及时看到祖国的报纸杂志。　吴大英
