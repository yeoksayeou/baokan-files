Sesshū Tōyō was an outstanding Japanese painter of the 15th century, born in 1420 and died in 1506. August 8th of this year marks the 450th anniversary of his death. The World Peace Council has decided to commemorate this outstanding painter this year.

Sesshū was born into a farmer's family in Akahama, Bicchu Province, Japan (now Misu Village, Toba County, Okayama Prefecture). He lived a poor and lonely life in his childhood. When he was twelve or thirteen years old, his father, unable to support him, sent him to a local monastery to become a monk. Among the Japanese people, there is still a story circulating: Sesshū loved to paint in this monastery but didn't recite scriptures. One day, the elder was very angry and tied him to a pillar in the main hall. He cried, and his tears dripped onto the floor. He used his big toe to draw a running mouse with the tears, and it looked so lifelike that the elder was startled, thinking it was a real mouse, and never interfered with his painting again. Later, he studied painting with the famous painter Tenshō Shūbun, who had studied in Korea. Due to his tireless efforts and research, his painting skills surpassed his teacher, and he was respected by the Japanese people. In 1468, the Japanese shogunate sent a "delegation" headed by Ten'yo Seikei to visit China. Sesshū participated in this "delegation," taking the first batch of ships to Ningbo on the east coast of China, and visited the Jiangnan area. In June 1468, he joined the official envoy Ten'yo Seikei and his party, traveling from Ningbo up the Grand Canal to Beijing in November, where they were received by Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty. In February 1469, he left Beijing with the delegation, retracing their route to Ningbo, and left Ningbo in May to return to Japan. His total stay in China was less than two years. During this not very long period, Sesshū made extensive contact with various aspects of China: he visited famous historical sites, toured the landscape, and forged sincere literary friendships with Chinese literati of the time such as Xu Lian, Zhan Xi, and the Old Man Chunzhuo. He also learned the "broken ink" technique from the famous painters Li Zai and Zhang Yousheng, exchanging artistic experiences. He painted murals in the central hall of the Ministry of Rites in Beijing, and painted "Tiger Creek Three Laughs" and "Four Sages of Mount Shang" at the home of Jin Shi in Ningbo. He also painted the three scenic wonders of Japan—Mount Fuji, Miho, and Kiyomi—for the Chinese people.

When Sesshū Tōyō returned to Japan from China, the old schools of Japanese painting (Kose School, Tosa School, etc.) were already in decline, while the new schools (Shūbun School, etc.) were clinging to the old ways, only knowing how to produce works according to copybooks, struggling in a formalized predicament and unable to develop further. He initially lived in Ōita in Bungo Province, and later moved to Yamaguchi in Suō Province. In both places, he built "Tenkai Gazōrō" (Studios for the Heavenly Opening of Pictures) to create works. Based on his majestic spirit and concise brushwork, he used realistic techniques to paint the vibrant landscapes of the Chinese mainland, pioneering a new era in the history of Japanese art. Due to his long-term and tireless hard work, he created a series of landscape paintings, the most important of which are "Kinzan-ji," "Ikuhō-zan," "Landscape Long Scroll," "Landscape Scroll," and "Splashed Ink Landscape," all of which are excellent works that shook the Japanese art world and enriched the world's art treasury.

Among them, "Ikuhō-zan" and "Kinzan-ji" (painted in 1472) depict the actual scenery of these two famous Chinese temples, portraying the actual conditions of the architecture at that time.

Among these representative works, the most noteworthy are the three masterpieces: "Landscape Long Scroll," "Landscape Scroll," and "Splashed Ink Landscape." The "Landscape Long Scroll" (painted in 1486) is an outpouring of the author's great aspirations and a summary of the author's total gains from his travels on the Chinese mainland. The brushwork is vigorous, the painting style is unique and bold, and it integrates the beauty of various Song and Yuan masters. It is a huge work, measuring fifty-two feet three inches and four minutes in length. The "Landscape Scroll" (painted in 1474) and "Splashed Ink Landscape" (painted in 1495) are practical applications of Sesshū's study of Gao Yan Jing's brushwork and his research on the "broken ink" technique with Li Zai during his time in China. The brushwork is elegant and fluent, and the ink is rich and dripping with moisture. The latter, in particular, with a light sweep, is full of vigor, has a unique style, and has a wonderful flavor, fully demonstrating the author's wisdom and genius. According to the postscript written by Sesshū himself, these two paintings were painting samples he used to teach his disciples' brushwork. In the few lines of the postscript, one can also glimpse the deep mutual respect and love between the author and his students, which is admirable. Sesshū not only deeply loved his own students, but also fulfilled his responsibility to cultivate and encourage other young painters.

Sesshū not only showed his high achievements in landscape, but also in portraits of figures, flowers, birds, and animals. Portraits such as "Huike Cutting Off His Arm" (1496) and "Masuda Kanetaka" (1479); flowers, birds, and animals such as the "Chrysanthemum" in the possession of Viscount Matsui, the "White Heron" in the possession of Viscount Fukuoka, and the "Herd of Horses" in the possession of the Tokyo Art School, are all vivid and lifelike, and are outstanding works with a high artistic level.

    日本画家雪舟二三事
    马采
    雪舟等杨是十五世纪日本一个杰出的画家，生于1420年，卒于1506年，今年八月八日恰好是他的逝世四百五十周年。世界和平理事会决定在今年纪念这位杰出的画家。
    雪舟生长在日本备中赤滨（现在冈山县都洼郡三须村）一个农民的家里，少年时代过着贫穷孤苦的生活。当他十二、三岁的时候，他的父亲因为养不了他，把他送到当地一个僧院当和尚。日本人民中间，至今流传着这样一个故事：雪舟在这个僧院里，爱画画，不诵经卷，有一天，长老很生气，把他绑在僧堂一根柱子上。他哭了，眼泪滴在地板上。他用脚的大趾将泪水画成一只奔走的老鼠，像活的一样，长老惊以为真的老鼠，从此不再干涉他画画了。后来他又跟曾经游学朝鲜的著名画家天章周文学习绘画。由于他不倦地努力和钻研，他的绘画技术竟超过了他的老师，受到了日本人民的尊敬。1468年日本幕府派遣了以天与清启为首的“使团”前来中国访问。雪舟参加了这个“使团”，乘坐第一批船，首先来到中国东海岸的宁波，并在江南一带参观。到1468年六月，才会同正使天与清启一行，从宁波溯运河于十一月来到北京，受到了明宪宗皇帝的接见。1469年二月他同使团离开北京，循着原路到宁波，五月离开宁波回日本。他逗留中国的全部时间不到二年。在这并不很长的期间内，雪舟在中国进行了多方面的广泛接触：历访名胜古迹，游览山水，并和中国当时的文学家徐琏、詹僖、纯拙老人等结下了真挚的文字交谊。他又从名画家李在和张有声学习破墨技法，交流艺术经验。他曾在北京礼部院中堂画了壁画，在宁波金湜的家里画了“虎溪三笑图”和“商山四皓图”。他又为中国人民画了富士、三保、清见日本三绝景。
    雪舟等杨从中国回到日本，正是日本画坛旧派（巨势派、土佐派等）已临雕落，新派（周文派等）却是抱残守缺，只知按着粉本制作，挣扎在形式化的苦境不能再进一步发展的时候。他最初住在丰后的大分，后来移住周防的山口，在这两个地方都建了“天开图画楼”，进行创作。本着他雄浑的气魄，简练的笔致，用写实主义的手法，画出了中国大陆的活的山水，在日本美术史上开辟了一个新纪元。由于他长期不倦的辛勤劳动，创造了一系列的山水画幅，其中最主要的如“金山寺”、“育王山”、“山水长卷”、“山水画卷”和“泼墨山水”等，都是震撼了日本画坛、丰富了世界艺术宝库的优秀作品。
    其中“育王山”和“金山寺”（1472年作），描绘了中国这两座名刹的实景，画出了当时建筑的实际情况。
    在这些代表作品中，最值得我们注意的，是“山水长卷”、“山水画卷”和“泼墨山水”三部巨作。“山水长卷”（1486年作）是倾吐作者伟大抱负、总结作者漫游中国大陆的总收获，笔致劲拔，画趣奇削，融汇宋元诸家之美于一炉，规模巨大，长达五十二尺三寸四分。“山水画卷”（ 1474年作）和“泼墨山水”（1495年作）是雪舟在中国时学习高彦敬笔意并和李在研究破墨技法的实际应用，笔致秀润酣畅，墨气淹润欲滴，后者更以轻轻一扫，神气充沛，特具风格，别有妙味，充分发挥了作者的智慧和天才。据雪舟手笔的跋文，这两幅画都是他传授门人笔法的画本，在跋文寥寥数行中，还可以窥见作者师生之间互相敬爱的一往情深，令人向慕。雪舟不但深爱自己的学生，而且对于其他青年画家，也尽了培养鼓励的责任。
    雪舟不但在山水方面，而且在人物肖像、花鸟动物方面，都显示了他的高度成就。人物肖像如“慧可断臂”（1496年作），“益田兼尧”（1479年作）；花鸟动物如松井子爵家所藏的“菊花”，福冈子爵家所藏的“白鹫”，东京美术学校所藏的“群马”，都是生动逼真，具有高度艺术水平的杰出作品。（附图片）
