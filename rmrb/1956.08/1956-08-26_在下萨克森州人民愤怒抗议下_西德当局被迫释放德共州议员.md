    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 25th: News from Hanover, West Germany, says that the Lower Saxony State Parliament in West Germany has listed the issue of the illegal arrest of Heinz Zierpel, the Communist member of the state parliament, by the police as the central topic of the next meeting of the state parliament. Zierpel was arrested during the wave of police terror on August 17th.
    The authorities' persecution of Zierpel, disregarding his parliamentary privilege from arrest as a member of the state parliament, has aroused enormous anger and resolute protest from people of all walks of life in the area. Under this pressure, the state's Ministry of the Interior had to order the release of parliament member Zierpel. The state parliament has also lodged a formal protest with the Ministry of the Interior regarding Zierpel's arrest. Zierpel also demanded that the Minister of the Interior of Lower Saxony, Weigmann, attend the state parliament to publicly answer questions.
    During his illegal detention by the police and after his release, Zierpel received support and condolences from many Social Democrats and other parties, as well as non-partisan people.

    在下萨克森州人民愤怒抗议下
    西德当局被迫释放德共州议员
    据新华社柏林25日电　从西德诺汉威来的消息说，西德下萨克森州州议会已经把这个州的共产党州议员海因次·柴尔培遭到警察非法逮捕的问题列为州议会下次会议的中心议题。柴尔培是在8月17日的警察恐怖浪潮中被捕的。
    当局不顾柴尔培作为州议员所享有的不受逮捕的特权而横加迫害，已经激起了当地各阶层人民的巨大愤怒和坚决抗议。在这种压力下，这个州的内政部不得不下令把柴尔培议员释放。州议会也就柴尔培被捕事向内政部提出了正式抗议。柴尔培也要求下萨克森州内政部长魏格曼出席州议会公开答复质询。
    柴尔培在被警察非法拘押期间和在获释以后受到许多社会民主党和其他党派以及无党派人士的声援和慰问。
