Revisiting the Lessons of Summer
He Cheng

Things in the world are inherently complex, but some people insist on simplifying them; this is called subjectivism, and such people often run into snags in their work.

This summer, wheat production in many areas decreased due to rain. Continuous rain affected the harvest, which was a difficulty imposed on the people by a natural disaster. However, from another perspective, the reason this natural disaster became an insurmountable difficulty has subjective causes.

The CCP Chang'an County Committee in Shaanxi Province made a very good self-criticism regarding this matter. The county's wheat production decreased by about 20 million jin this year, which is a considerable loss. The county committee's self-criticism stated that this was because, before the summer harvest, they only saw the scene of a bumper wheat harvest, and all work deployments proceeded from the favorable side, neglecting the possibility of a sudden attack by natural disasters. Once heavy rain arrived, cadres and the masses were caught off guard, and losses were unavoidable.

In fact, at that time, there were many conditions that could have helped people reduce losses. For example, local farmers originally had the experience of "harvesting as it yellows," and there was also the custom of asking farmers from late-maturing wheat areas to help with the harvest temporarily; however, these experiences and customs were forgotten by people who constantly talked about "superiority" and "the advanced cooperative has more people and greater strength." What's so strange about suffering losses under these circumstances?

The reason for bringing up the summer story again now, without fear of trouble, is that the autumn harvest season is approaching, and the lessons of summer are useful for autumn.

Leading production is like commanding a battle, and various situations should be anticipated in advance. The autumn harvest should be carried out in conjunction with autumn plowing and autumn planting, and none of these can be delayed. However, among these three tasks, there is ultimately a priority, and have all regions arranged them appropriately? If the weather happens to be clear and crisp during the harvest, things will of course be smooth, but what if there is rain or early frost? Many cooperatives will harvest more crops this year than in previous years, and the area to be planted in the autumn is larger than in previous years. What if the existing manpower and materials are not enough? Many areas can achieve a bumper harvest this year, but the bumper harvest will also bring new problems. Is the space sufficient? Have transportation and storage problems been resolved? As for the areas affected by floods, there is a series of problems waiting for people to solve during the autumn harvest and planting, which everyone can easily think of.

If we not only think of the favorable side, but also think of the difficult side, and not only consider the normal approach, but also think of the approach under extraordinary circumstances, subjectivism will be reduced.

    重温夏天的教训
    何成
    世界上的事情本来是复杂的，可是，有人偏偏把它简单化了；这就叫作主观主义，这样的人在工作中常常要碰钉子。
    今年夏天有不少地区的小麦因雨减产。阴雨连绵，影响收割，这是自然灾害加给人们的困难。可是，从另一方面看起来，这个自然灾害所以竟然成为不可克服的困难，却有主观的原因在。
    关于这件事情，中共陕西长安县委作过一个很好的检讨。这个县的小麦今年减产约二千万斤，损失是不小的。县委检讨说，这是因为在夏收以前，仅仅看到小麦大丰收的景象，一切工作部署都从有利的一面出发，忽略了自然灾害突然袭击的可能性；一旦大雨到来，干部、群众手忙脚乱，损失乃不可免。
    其实，当时有许多条件可以帮助人们减少损失。比如，当地农民原有“随黄随收”的经验，也有请小麦晚熟地区的农民临时帮工收割的习惯；可是，这些经验和习惯都被开口“优越性”、闭口“高级社人多力量大”的人们忘记了。在这种情况下受损失，还有什么可以奇怪的？
    现在这样不惮麻烦地重提夏天的故事，是因为秋收季节就要到来，夏天的教训对秋天是有用处的。
    领导生产像指挥打仗，事先应该设想各种各样的情况。秋收要和秋耕、秋种交插进行，那一项都不能耽误。但是，这三项任务当中，毕竟有个先后缓急，各个地区是否都安排的很合适了呢？如果收割时恰恰天高气爽，事情当然是顺利的，可是，如果发生了阴雨、早霜怎么办呢？许多合作社今年要收获的庄稼比往年多了，要秋种的面积比往年大了，现有的人力物力如果不够怎么办呢？今年许多地区可获丰收，但丰收也会带来新问题，场地够用不够用？运输、仓储问题是不是都解决了呢？至于遭受水灾的地区，在秋收秋种之际，更有一系列的问题等待着人们去解决，大家都是容易想到的。
    不仅想到有利的一面，而且想到困难的一面，不仅考虑正常情况下的作法，而且想到非常情况下的作法，主观主义就减少了。
