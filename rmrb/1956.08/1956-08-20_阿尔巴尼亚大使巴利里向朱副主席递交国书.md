When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Dello Balili delivered a eulogy, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.
　　
In his eulogy, Ambassador Dello Balili said:
　　
Since the establishment of our two free republics, and since the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of first ambassadors between our two countries, although the time has been short, a close, comprehensive, and sincere friendship has been established between our two fraternal peoples. The foundation of this friendship and brotherhood is the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the glorious victory of the Soviet Union over German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the Albanian People's Liberation Struggle. The Albanian people regard the fraternal Chinese people as their sincere, loyal, and powerful friends, who generously assist the Albanian people in their peaceful construction. The Albanian people cherish this fraternal friendship and selfless assistance and strive to further consolidate this friendship in the future, so as to further develop and consolidate the friendly relations and close cooperation between our two countries, to promote the welfare and happiness of our two peoples.
　　
The Albanian people, with constant concern and deep affection, follow the brilliant victories achieved by the great Chinese people in their socialist construction under the wise and courageous leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. In the near future, the heroic Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party will summarize these great achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people, and this Party Congress will open up broader prospects for the confident future of your great country.
　　
The People's Republic of China has become a great international power and a very important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. It is now an undeniable fact that major outstanding international issues cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. In fact, the People's Republic of China has made great contributions to easing international tensions and developing peaceful cooperation among nations.
　　
The Albanian people welcome the consistent, peace-loving, and wise policy pursued by the Government of the People's Republic of China to ensure international cooperation and guarantee peace in Asia and the world, and fully support its legitimate desire to liberate Taiwan and restore its rightful position in the United Nations. The aggressive policy pursued by the imperialist war-mongering groups and their despicable provocations against the People's Republic of China are doomed to utter failure.
　　
The Albanian people, first with the full assistance of the Soviet Union, and with the full assistance of the fraternal People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries, have achieved great victories in building the foundations of socialism. Our country, with a small but indomitable population, has resolutely joined the ranks of the great camp of peace and socialism headed by our close friend, the powerful Soviet Union, is vigilantly defending its achievements, and looks forward to its bright future with unwavering confidence. Now the Albanian people have begun to work on completing the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan and believe that, with the help of their close friends, they will achieve even greater successes.
　　
Vice Chairman, as I present my credentials to you, please allow me to convey the greetings of the Albanian people, the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, and the Government to the fraternal Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and to you yourself, Vice Chairman. At the same time, please allow me to express my full confidence that I will receive assistance from you and the Government of the People's Republic of China during the period of my duties entrusted to me by my government. On my part, I assure you that I will do everything in my power to continuously strengthen the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between our two fraternal peoples.
　　
In his reply, Vice Chairman Zhu De said:
　　
I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by you, appointing you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania to the People's Republic of China, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.
　　
The Albanian people are a freedom-loving, hardworking, and courageous people. They have waged many heroic struggles against foreign enslavement and finally achieved a great victory. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the government, have built Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country and have greatly consolidated the people's democratic system. The Albanian people have also made important contributions to the struggle to ease international tensions. The Chinese people admire the great achievements made by the Albanian people in the cause of socialist construction and in the struggle to safeguard world peace, and are inspired by these achievements.
　　
In recent years, the friendly cooperation between our two peoples in the political, economic, cultural, and other fields has achieved comprehensive development. I firmly believe that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples will be further consolidated and developed. This will not only benefit the increase of the happiness of our two peoples, but also help strengthen the forces of world peace.
　　
Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to assume the post of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Albanian to the People's Republic of China. In your work to promote friendly cooperation between China and Albania, you will receive the full support of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    阿尔巴尼亚大使巴利里向朱副主席递交国书
    新华社19日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国新任驻华特命全权大使德略·巴利里偕一等秘书比诺，在十九日下午向中华人民共和国副主席朱德递交国书。在场的有中华人民共和国外交部副部长张闻天，全国人民代表大会常务委员会典礼局局长余心清，外交部苏联东欧司副司长李汇川和礼宾司副司长王雨田。
    递交国书时，德略·巴利里大使致颂词，朱德副主席致答辞。
    德略·巴利里大使在致颂词中说：
    自从我们两个自由的共和国成立以来，自从我们两国建立外交关系和互派首任大使以来，虽然为时尚短，但是在我们两国兄弟般的人民之间却已经建立起了紧密的、全面的和真诚的友谊。这种友谊和兄弟关系的基础是马克思列宁主义的不朽的原则，是伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，是苏联战胜德国纳粹主义和日本军国主义的光辉胜利，是中国人民革命的胜利和阿尔巴尼亚人民解放斗争的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟般的中国人民看作是自己的真诚的、忠实的和强大的朋友，这位朋友对阿尔巴尼亚人民进行本国的和平建设给予慷慨的帮助。阿尔巴尼亚人民非常珍视这种兄弟般的友谊和这种无私的帮助，并努力使这个友谊今后更加巩固，为的是使我们两国间的友好联系和紧密合作更加发展和巩固，以增进我们两国人民的福利和幸福。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着一贯的关切和深厚的友爱之情关注着伟大的中国人民在本国的社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌胜利，这种胜利是中国的劳动人民在光荣的中国共产党英明而勇敢的领导之下获得的。在最近的将来英勇的中国共产党第八次代表大会将对兄弟般的中国人民所获得的这些巨大成就进行总结，这次党代会将为你们伟大国家的信心百倍的将来开辟更广阔的远景。
    中华人民共和国已经成为一个伟大的国际强国，成为一个在维护亚洲和世界和平事业中非常重要的因素，各项悬而未决的重大国际问题没有中华人民共和国的参加是不可能获得解决的，这些情况现在已经成为无可否认的事实了。而事实上，中华人民共和国对缓和国际紧张局势和发展各国间和平合作的事业也已作出了巨大的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民欢迎中华人民共和国政府为保证国际合作、保证亚洲和世界和平所奉行的这种始终不渝的、爱好和平的和英明的政策，并完全支持它要求解放台湾和在联合国里恢复自己应有的地位的合理愿望。帝国主义的战争贩子集团所执行的侵略政策及其对中华人民共和国的卑鄙挑衅是注定要完全失败的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，首先在苏联的全面帮助之下，并在兄弟般的中华人民共和国及其他各人民民主国家的全面帮助之下，在建设社会主义基础方面获得了巨大的胜利。人口不多但是坚强不屈的我国人民坚决地参加了以我们亲密的朋友——强大的苏联为首的和平和社会主义的伟大阵营的行列里，正在警惕地捍卫着业已取得的成就，并且怀着毫不动摇的信心瞻望着自己光明的将来。现在阿尔巴尼亚人民已着手进行完成第二个五年计划各项任务的工作，并相信，有了自己亲密朋友们的帮助，将会取得更大的成就。
    副主席同志，在我向您递交国书的时候，请允许我向兄弟般的中国人民、中华人民共和国政府和您本人，副主席同志，转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团和政府的问候之意。同时，请允许我表示我充分的信心，在我履行我国政府所交给我的职务的期间，我将得到您和中华人民共和国政府方面的帮助。在我方面，我向您保证，我将尽一切力量使我们两国兄弟人民间的友谊和全面合作不断地加强。
    朱德副主席在致答词中说：
    我很高兴地接受您所递交的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团任命您为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，并且衷心地感谢您的祝贺。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是爱好自由、勤劳勇敢的人民。他们曾经为反对外国奴役进行过许多次英勇的斗争，终于取得了伟大的胜利。自从阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的领导下，已经把阿尔巴尼亚从一个落后的农业国建设成为农业—工业国，并且大大地巩固了人民民主制度。阿尔巴尼亚人民在促进缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中也作出了重要的贡献。中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设事业和维护世界和平斗争中所获得的重大成就表示钦佩，并且为这些成就感到鼓舞。
    几年来，我们两国人民在政治、经济、文化等各方面的友好合作已经获得了全面的发展。我深信，中阿两国人民的兄弟般的友谊将会进一步地巩固和发展。这不仅有利于我们两国人民幸福的增进，而且也有助于世界和平力量的加强。
    大使同志，我热烈地欢迎您出任阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使。在您为增进中阿两国友好合作的工作中，您将得到我和中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。
