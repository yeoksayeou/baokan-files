Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The nine parliamentarians of the Kingdom of Laos conveyed the Lao people's wish for friendship with the Chinese people when they visited the leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress this afternoon. Lao Kingdom parliamentarian Phoumi Vongvichit said that China and Laos are neighbors and have many things in common. We hope that the friendship between China and Laos will be further consolidated and developed.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, agreed with his opinion. He said that the long-standing relationship between China and Laos has always been peaceful. China is willing to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is willing to enhance the new friendship between China and Laos on this new basis. We Chinese people support the peaceful and neutral policy announced by the Lao Kingdom government.

At this friendly gathering, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Cheng Qian, Gao Chongmin, and Zhou Jianren, members of the Standing Committee, also attended the reception for these guests from Laos and had cordial conversations with them. In his speech, Phoumi Vongvichit expressed his gratitude for the support of the Chinese people's representatives for the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by Laos. He also pointed out that although there is a geographical natural boundary between China and Laos, there is no such boundary in the hearts of the people of the two countries.

Guo Moruo replied that this is because both China and Laos are peaceful countries, and the border between our two countries is also a peaceful border. Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people are engaged in peaceful construction and need a peaceful environment. He hoped that more Lao friends would visit China and offer opinions on our work.

The Lao parliamentarian finally talked about his impressions of visiting Shenyang and Anshan. He said that they saw construction everywhere in China and smiling faces of the Chinese people everywhere. He said that he would take back everything he saw and heard to tell the Lao people, so that the Lao people would know how the Chinese people are living. He also hoped that the Lao people could live a happy life of peaceful construction like the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Loun Insisiengmay, Minister of Finance, National Economy and Planning of the Kingdom of Laos, paid a visit to Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, this afternoon. Present were Yang Haolu, Director of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Shu Ziqing, Deputy Director of the Export Bureau.
