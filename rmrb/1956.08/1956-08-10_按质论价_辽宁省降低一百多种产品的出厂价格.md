    Pricing Based on Quality
    Liaoning Province Reduces Factory Prices of Over a Hundred Products

    According to Xinhua News Agency, factories of local industries in Liaoning Province, following the principle of pricing based on quality, have adjusted the factory prices of over one hundred and ten industrial products. Among them, the factory prices of daily necessities have been reduced by 4% to 24.95%. For example, cloth-surfaced rubber shoes (including Lux shoes, sneakers, cotton-padded rubber shoes, etc.) are of lower quality than equivalent products from Shanghai and Tianjin, but their prices were much higher. The factory price has now been reduced by 24%.

    In the past, the prices of local industrial products in Liaoning Province were generally higher compared to products from Shanghai and Tianjin. For example, the mercerization of socks was not bright, the colors were old, but the prices were 2% to 30% higher than socks produced in Shanghai;绒毛sweaters were not soft, the colors were dull, and the styles were not beautiful, and the prices were also about 15% higher than those produced in Shanghai and Tianjin. The main reason for this was that some industrial departments overemphasized their backward technical and management levels and did not actively improve product quality or reduce costs compared to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. As a result, many products were not selling well and were heavily stockpiled.

    按质论价
    辽宁省降低一百多种产品的出厂价格
    据新华社讯　辽宁省地方工业各工厂，根据按质论价的精神，调整了一百一十多种工业品的出厂价格。其中生活用品的出厂价格，降低4％到24.95％。如布面胶鞋（包括力士鞋、球鞋、棉胶鞋等），质量不如上海、天津的同等产品好，而价格却贵得多，这次便降低了出厂价格24％。
    过去，辽宁省的地方工业产品和上海、天津等地的产品比较，价格一般偏高。如袜子的丝光不亮、色泽陈旧，而价格却比上海出产的袜子高2％到30％；绒衣不柔软、颜色暗淡、式样不美，价格也比上海、天津出产的高15％左右。其原因主要是某些工业部门过分强调技术和管理水平落后，不能和上海、天津等地相比，没有积极去改进产品质量，降低成本，很多产品因此销路不畅，被大量积压。
