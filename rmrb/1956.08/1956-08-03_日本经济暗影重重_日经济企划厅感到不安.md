Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency said in its monthly report today with concern that Japan's economy is harboring dangers that may damage its future economic health.

The Economic Planning Agency's report analyzed the recent months' development of the Japanese economy. It felt particularly uneasy about the phenomenon of Japan's export trade beginning to decline. Japan's exports had been continuously increasing since last year and had become the main pillar of Japan's economic "boom."

Japan's exports have significantly declined since May of this year, and import surpluses have been increasing month by month. According to customs statistics, in the first twenty days of July, Japan's foreign trade import surplus reached 67.6 million US dollars, an increase of 22.3 million US dollars compared to the same period in June.

The Economic Planning Agency's report also focused on another worrying factor in the current Japanese economy: the main force of industry is now engaged in investment in production equipment. It said that this situation forces Japan to face alarming problems such as over-investment, lack of raw materials, and overproduction.

    日本经济暗影重重
    日经济企划厅感到不安
    据新华社1日讯东京消息：日本政府经济企划厅今天在它的每月报告中担心地说，日本的经济孕育着可能损害它未来的经济健康的危险。
    经济企划厅的报告分析了最近几个月日本经济发展的情况。它对日本出口贸易开始下降的现象特别感到不安。日本的输出自从去年以来曾经不断增加，并且成为日本经济“景气”的主要支柱。
    日本的输出从今年五月以来显著下降，入超逐月增加。根据海关的统计，在七月份的头二十天，日本对外贸易入超达六千七百六十万美元，比六月份同期增加了二千二百三十万美元。
    经济企划厅在报告中还着重谈到了当前日本经济中另外一个令人不安的因素：工业的主要力量现在从事于生产装备的投资。它说，这种情况迫使日本面临例如投资过多、原料缺乏和生产过剩这些令人惊慌的问题。
