    Stillborn Steam Hammer Rod

    Everyone knows how important cooperation between enterprises is for fulfilling the national plan. Yet there are enterprises like Factory 443 that treat the collaborative requirements of fraternal units with an extremely irresponsible attitude.

    In 1954, Factory 497 added a five-ton steam hammer but could not officially put it into production due to the lack of a steam hammer rod. After the主管工业部 (responsible industrial ministry) decided, Factory 443 was to collaborate in forging two steam hammer rods, with steel ingots supplied by Fushun Steel Plant. At that time, all three factories signed delivery contracts.

    Isn't the problem being resolved very smoothly? Not so. Fushun Steel Plant was originally scheduled to deliver the goods in August, but it dragged on until December before the steel ingots were sent to Factory 443. This, of course, affected Factory 443's on-time delivery, and Factory 443 cannot be blamed. However, now that the steel ingots have arrived, shouldn't they be forged quickly? No, Factory 443 refused to forge them under the excuse of "not being included in the production plan." The production tasks of Factory 497 were directly affected, and the entire factory was anxious about not having a steam hammer rod. The factory sent Vice Director Wu to fly to Factory 443 to negotiate in person. After repeated requests, Factory 443 agreed to deliver the goods in March 1956 and signed the contract for the second time.

    Time passed day by day, and when the delivery date arrived, there was still no sign of the steam hammer rod. In April, Factory 497 had to send a purchasing agent to urge the delivery. As soon as the purchasing agent arrived at Factory 443, the workshop dispatcher told him, "It has already been shipped." This purchasing agent was a bit experienced in urging deliveries. He did not lightly believe their words and ran to the shipping point to investigate. The steam hammer rod was nowhere to be found; when he returned to Factory 443 to inquire, even the steel ingots sent by Fushun Steel Plant were nowhere to be found. Later, after searching everywhere, it took a lot of effort to find one from the scrap iron pile. The comrades of Factory 443 said, "We are really sorry, we guarantee delivery on June 25th." Thus, the third delivery contract was signed.

    Comrades, guess what? You will definitely say, "This time it will be delivered on time!" No, that's not the case at all. On June 28th, Vice Director Wu of Factory 497, seeing that there was still no news of delivery, rushed to Factory 443 for the second time, only to find that the steel ingots were still untouched. The responsible comrade of Factory 443 apologized to Vice Director Wu: "We are really sorry." Vice Director Wu learned a lesson this time, not only "listening to their words" but also "observing their actions." He signed the fourth delivery contract with Factory 443, stating that after the materials were sent before July 10th, he waited until he personally saw the factory start forging before leaving.

    Who knew that at the end of July, Factory 443 still had not delivered the goods. On July 31st, Vice Director Wu rushed to Factory 443 for the third time, only to find that although one steam hammer rod had been forged, it was safely placed in the warehouse without being shipped, and the other ingot had not even been found.

    Speaking of this, people can't help but wonder, does Factory 443 really have insurmountable difficulties? Otherwise, why would they treat their fraternal factory like this? Yes, there are difficulties. Last time, Fushun Steel Plant did not deliver the goods on time, and it is completely understandable that forging could not be done on time. However, after Fushun Steel Plant had already delivered the steel ingots, why did a task that could be completed in only four or five hours take several months? Is it because they are afraid of disrupting the plan? Why hasn't it been included in the plan for several months? Why is the forged steam hammer rod not included in the July shipping plan? Why is there still a poor steel ingot that has become an orphan, not knowing where it has drifted? To put it bluntly, the main reason is that Factory 443 lacks a spirit of cooperation. They do not regard the contract as a guarantee of credibility, but as a "shield" to deal with their duties perfunctorily.

    难产的汽锤杆
    人人都知道，企业之间的协作，对于完成国家计划是多么重要。可是也竟有像443厂这样的企业，用极端不负责任的态度来对待兄弟单位的协作要求。
    1954年，497厂增加了一部五吨汽锤，因为缺少汽锤杆不能正式投入生产。经主管工业部决定由443厂协作锻造两根汽锤杆，钢锭由抚顺钢厂供给。当时三个厂都签订了交货合同。
    问题不是解决得十分顺利吗？不然。抚顺钢厂原定八月份交货，一直拖到十二月才把钢锭送到443厂。这当然影响了443厂按期交货，怪不得443厂。然而钢锭既然到了，可以赶紧锻造了吧？不，443厂反以“没有排进生产计划”为借口，拒绝锻造。497厂的生产任务直接受到影响了，全厂都为没有汽锤杆而焦虑，厂里派了吴副厂长亲自乘飞机赶到443厂交涉。经过三番五次苦苦哀求，443厂才答应1956年3月交货，并且第二次签订了合同。
    时间一天天过去了，到了交货的日期又不见汽锤杆的踪影。四月里，497厂只得又派了采购员前去坐催。采购员一到443厂，车间调度员就告诉他说：“早已运走了。”这位采购员催货是有点经验的，他没有轻信他们的话，跑到发货地点追查了一遍，汽锤杆毫无着落；再回到443厂一问，连抚顺钢厂送来的钢锭也不知放在哪里了。后来东找西寻，费了九牛二虎之力，才从废铁堆中找出一个。443厂的同志们说：“实在对不起，保证六月二十五日交货”。这样，订了第三次交货合同。
    同志，你猜怎么样呢？你一定会说：“这回如期交货了吧！”不，完全不是这么一回事。六月二十八日，497厂的吴副厂长见依然没有交货的音讯，第二次赶到443厂时，钢锭还原封未动。443厂的负责同志向吴副厂长表示道歉：“实在对不起”。吴副厂长这次接受了教训，不但“听其言”而且“观其行”。他同443厂订了第四次交货合同，言明七月十日以前运去之后，直等到亲自看着厂内下了料，开始锻造，才走了。
    谁知七月底了，443厂还是没有交货。七月三十一日，吴副厂长第三次赶到443厂，才发现汽锤杆虽然锻出一根，却安然放在仓库里没有起运，另一个连钢锭还没有找到下落。
    说到这里，人们不禁要怀疑，443厂真有不可克服的困难吧？不然他们凭什么这样对待兄弟厂呢？是的，困难是有的。前一次抚顺钢厂没有按期交货，不能按期锻造是完全可以理解的。可是，当抚顺钢厂已经交了钢锭之后，为什么只用四、五小时就能完成的任务要拖上好几个月呢？说是怕打乱计划吧？为什么几个月了，还排不上计划呢？为什么已经锻出的汽锤杆不订入七月份的运货计划呢？为什么至今还有一个可怜的钢锭成了没有娘的孩子不知流落到哪儿去了呢？揭开来说，主要就是443厂缺乏协作精神，他们没有把合同当成信用的保证书，而是当成应付差事的“挡箭牌”了。　497厂　谭开
