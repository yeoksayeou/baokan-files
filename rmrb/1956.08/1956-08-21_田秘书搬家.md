    Secretary Tian Jing of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, with a family of six, lived in four spacious rooms, but that still didn’t satisfy her. Secretary Tian requested a house in the Western Hills residential area of her unit. The conditions were: quiet, spacious, fresh air, and not facing the street. According to these conditions, the administrative office found her a Class A building, but Secretary Tian said, "The woman next door has lung disease, no good." They found another one, but Secretary Tian said, "It's by the street, too noisy." In the end, Secretary Tian had to go out herself to find one, but several cadres from her unit were already living there.
    Not many days later, Secretary Tian wanted to move. That morning, Secretary Tian ran to Cheng Lin, the director of the administrative office, and said, "Old Cheng, I'm moving today, how are your preparations going? … What, you didn't know? Oh dear, what's going on! How come it's not ready yet? Anyway, I'm moving into that house at nine o'clock…" Director Cheng was alarmed: moving at nine o'clock, that's too soon. She only said she wanted to move the day before yesterday, so there hadn't been time to move the original residents out yet. But Secretary Tian's affairs were not easy to handle, she could turn nasty at any moment.
    It happened to be Sunday, and the office was empty. Director Cheng managed to find Zheng, the section chief in charge of housing, Zhao, the clerk, Shao, the clerk, and the administrator. Led by the director, they went to "persuade" the three families to move. If these three families were to move elsewhere, the residents of those places would have to move to another place. To vacate this building, at least eight families had to move simultaneously. Therefore, a wave of moving swept through the Western Hills residential area that day. After "persuasion," two of the three families had reluctantly agreed to move, but the Guo family refused to move immediately. The woman of the house had been pleading with Administrator Liu since yesterday, when he told her to move, saying, "My husband is attending a meeting in Beijing, let's wait until he gets back. Moving with a family is not easy."
    Administrator Liu said, "I don't care, Secretary Tian wants this house, you can't refuse to move."
    "Isn't Secretary Tian's apartment in the main building very spacious? Why does she have to move here?"
    "Don't talk nonsense!" Administrator Liu snapped. "I think you'd better move first, or if Secretary Tian gets angry, I'm afraid you won't even be able to live in that other house."
    A housewife whose husband was not at home was always indecisive. Administrator Liu continued, "Let me tell you, Secretary Tian is a leader herself, always with the bureau chief… What are you guys! The leader has taken a fancy to this house, can you refuse?" Administrator Liu's words finally had an effect. The woman burst into tears and had no choice but to promise to vacate the house for Secretary Tian tomorrow. But today, at such a critical moment, the woman disagreed to move again.
    "My God!" Administrator Liu shouted at the woman, "Aren't you putting me in a tight spot? Secretary Tian is moving in soon, the director, section chiefs… my superiors are all coming, what am I going to do…." Sure enough, Director Cheng, Section Chief Zheng, Clerk Shao, etc. arrived at this moment, and the truck for Secretary Tian's move arrived fully loaded with furniture. The cadres and laborers helping with the move were also all present. Director Cheng asked Administrator Liu and then walked straight towards the woman, shouting loudly, "Why on earth won't you move!"
    "My husband is not at home, I don't dare to make the decision."
    "You're such a housewife! You don't think about the leadership at all."
    An awkward stalemate. Secretary Tian in the crowd had to go into action herself. She said with a "noble" and somewhat contemptuous tone, "Move quickly! Housewife, you're so narrow-minded." After speaking, Secretary Tian covered her nose and rushed into the house, tearing off the paper on the Guo family's wall with a snap. The people who came to help also rushed in to support Secretary Tian.
    "I'm not moving anyway!" The woman also got angry.
    "If you don't move, we'll nail the door shut! We won't let you in or out." The helpers chimed in.
    "Nail it shut, we'll go through the window!"
    Secretary Tian saw that the sky was very gloomy and ordered the helpers to quickly move the three families' belongings outside and move her own things into the house, otherwise the rain would wet them. The helpers immediately started working together, quickly moving the three families' belongings out. Secretary Tian's things were arranged in the house according to plan. Secretary Tian happily arranged her things in the house: this room is the living room, that room is the office, the inner room is the bedroom, and the outer room is the dining room. This is where the wardrobe goes, that is where the tea table goes….
    But the three families who were driven out stood beside their luggage, suppressing their anger and holding back their tears. Their neighbors, the people who came to watch the excitement, discussed among themselves, feeling sorry for the three unfortunate families.

    田秘书搬家
    洪雨
    阜新矿务局的秘书田井，一家六口人，住着四间宽敞的房间，可是还不能满她的心意。田秘书请求要一座本单位西山住宅区的房子。条件是：既安静，又宽敞，空气清新，不靠街道。根据这个条件，行政处替她找到一座甲字楼，田秘书说：“旁边那一户的妇女有肺病，不行。”又找一座，田秘书说：“靠街道，太乱。”最后还是田秘书亲自出马才找到了一座，不过这里正住着几个本单位的干部。
    不几天，田秘书就想搬家了。那天早晨田秘书跑到行政处长程林家说：“老程呀，我今天要搬家，你们准备得怎样啦？……怎么，不知道？唉呀，怎么搞的！到这时怎么还没准备好？反正我九点钟就往那座房子里搬……”程处长一听：九点钟就搬，这可太急了。前天她才说要搬，所以还没来得及把原来的住户搬出去哩。可是，田秘书的事可不好办，动不动她就会翻脸的。
    这天碰巧是星期天，办公室没人，程处长好容易才把管理住宅的郑科长、赵科员、邵科员和管理员找来，在处长率领下，去“动员”这三户人家搬家。这三家住户要往别处搬，别处的住户还得往另一处搬，为了腾出这栋房子，至少得有八户同时搬家。因此，这天在西山住宅区里就形成了搬家的热潮。这三户人家经过“动员”，已经有两户不得不同意搬了，单单是姓郭的一家不同意马上就搬。那家的女主人从昨天刘管理员叫她搬家以后，一直哀求刘管理员说：“我丈夫正在北京开会，等回来再搬吧。拉家带口地搬个家可不容易。”
    刘管理员说：“这个我不管，田秘书要这个房子，你不搬算不行。”
    “田秘书住在大楼上不是很宽敞吗，为啥非往这搬呢？”
    “不准乱说！”刘管理员火了：“我看哪，你还是先搬为妙，要不然等田秘书一火，恐怕你连那边的房子都住不着了。”
    一个丈夫没在身旁的家庭妇女，总是拿不定主意。刘管理员接着说：“告诉你，田秘书本身就是首长，天天在局长跟前……你们算啥玩艺儿！首长看上这座房子啦，不给能行？”刘管理员这一番话到底发生了效果。这位妇女被吓哭了，只好答应明天就给田秘书腾房子。可是，今天在这样紧要关头，这位妇女又不同意搬家了。
    “我的天呀！”刘管理员向那妇女喊叫起来：“你不是叫我坐腊吗？一会儿田秘书就搬来了，处长、科长……我的上级都来了，这叫我……。”果然，程处长、郑科长、邵科员等在这时赶到了，田秘书搬家的大卡车也满载家具开来了，帮助搬家的干部和扛工也都到齐了。程处长问了刘管理员之后，直朝着这位妇女走来，大声吼叫着：“你到底为啥不搬家！”
    “我丈夫没在家，不敢做主。”
    “真是个家庭妇女！你一点也不给领导上想想。”
    难堪的僵局。在人群里的田秘书只好亲自上阵，她用一种又“高贵”又有些轻蔑的味道说：“快搬吧！家庭妇女，一点也想不开。”说完，田秘书捂着鼻子闯进屋去，把老郭家墙上贴的纸刷地扯了下来，前来帮忙的人员也一齐闯进去为田秘书站脚助威。
    “反正我不搬！”这位妇女也火了。
    “不搬，把门钉上！不叫你出入。”帮忙的人们七嘴八舌地说。
    “钉上，我们走窗户！”
    田秘书看见天阴的很沉，命令帮忙的人们赶快把那三家东西搬在外边，把自己的东西搬到屋里，要不然下雨会淋湿的。帮忙的人们立刻一齐动起手来，三下五除二地把这三家的东西捣腾出去了。田秘书的东西按照计划安置在屋里。田秘书愉快地在屋里摆布着自己的东西：这屋是客厅，那屋是办公室，里屋是寝室，外屋是餐厅。这儿放衣柜，那儿放茶桌……。
    可是被撵出来的三户人家，压着气，含着泪站在自己的行李旁边。他们的邻居，前来看热闹的人们纷纷议论，为这三户不幸的人家感到不平。
