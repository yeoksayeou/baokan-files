Xinhua News Agency report: A bridge-building unit of the Railway Corps constructing the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway successfully erected a nine-span, 24-meter steel plate girder bridge on the Yingtan-Xiamen line in twelve hours and twenty minutes on August 1st. This surpassed their previous record of erecting an eight-span, 24-meter steel plate girder bridge in twelve hours two months ago, setting a new bridge-building record since the commencement of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway construction.

    On the eve of "August 1st" (Army Day), the twenty-one-meter-long steel arm of a large bridge-building machine, hoisting a twenty-four-meter-long, thirty-six-ton steel plate girder, slowly extended towards the Shaxi River, a tributary of the Min River. On the bridge construction site, illuminated as bright as day, it delivered one black steel plate girder after another to the piers. Before dawn on August 1st, the soldiers erected the last girder in just forty-five minutes in the cool breeze, more than an hour faster than when they erected the first girder. This ensured that the floats celebrating "August 1st" and the track-laying train could cross the Shaxi River on Army Day and enter Yong'an Station on time.

    From the end of February to the present, this bridge-building team of the Railway Corps has erected forty-five bridges of varying sizes on the northern section of the Yingtan-Xiamen line, including nearly one hundred and fifty steel plate girders and concrete girders, ensuring the rapid advancement of the track-laying project towards Xiamen.

    修建鹰厦铁路的铁道兵创造架桥新纪录
    据新华社讯　修建鹰厦铁路的铁道兵一支架桥部队，八月一日在十二小时二十分钟内架好鹰厦线上一座九孔二十四公尺的钢板梁大桥，超过了他们两个月前在十二小时内架设八孔二十四公尺的钢板梁桥的纪录，创造了鹰厦铁路开工以来架桥的最高纪录。
    “八一”前夕，一架大型架桥机二十一公尺长的钢铁臂膀，高吊着二十四公尺长、三十六吨重的钢板梁，徐徐伸向闽江支流沙溪河面，在灯光如白昼的桥梁工地上，把一孔又一孔黑色的钢板梁送向桥墩。八月一日黎明前，战士们在凉爽的风中只四十五分钟就架好最后一孔梁，比架设第一孔梁快了一小时多。使庆祝“八一”节的彩车和铺轨列车按时在建军节日跨过沙溪开进永安车站。
    铁道兵这支架桥队从今年二月底到现在，已经架好鹰厦线北段四十五座大小桥梁，包括近一百五十孔钢板梁和混凝土梁，保证了铺轨工程快速向厦门推进。
