    See Where Criticism Comes From
    Some people aren't completely unwilling to listen to criticism, but rather want to see where the criticism comes from.
    If a superior criticizes him, he sincerely accepts it, feeling it's good medicine that can cure his illness.
    If a subordinate criticizes him, he firmly rejects it, feeling it's "poison" that seems to be life-threatening.
    "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened; heed only one side and you will be benighted." These people should carefully think about this saying.

    看批评来自何方
    有些人不是完全不愿意听取批评，而是要看批评来自何方。
    上级批评他，诚恳心接受，觉得这是良药，可以治病。
    下级批评他，他坚决拒绝，觉得这是“毒药”，仿佛是要命。
    “兼听则明，偏听则暗”，这些人应当仔细想想这句话。
