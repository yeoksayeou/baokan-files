Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd: Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi invited members of the business community to a symposium on July 31st and August 1st. More than 80 business representatives attended, including Sheng Pihua, Hu Juewen, and Rong Yiren. Chen Pixian, Second Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Shanghai Deputy Mayors Cao Diqiu, Song Richang, and Liu Shuzhou, as well as heads of relevant departments of the Municipal People's Committee, also participated.

During the day and a half symposium, 23 business representatives spoke. Coming from large, medium, and small enterprises in various industries, they raised many opinions on the relationship between public and private parties in joint ventures, industrial production, economic restructuring, and the business arrangements and living conditions of small business owners. In their speeches, they criticized shortcomings in the government's work and offered suggestions for improvement. Wu Zhenshan of the cotton textile industry said in his speech: "In some joint ventures, public and private personnel work and study together, and the relationship is very good. However, in some joint ventures, public representatives tend to monopolize everything and do not respect the authority of the private side." Jin Ruiqi said that in general joint stores, the public and private parties treat each other with respect and are very polite, but in reality this phenomenon is not very normal. Small business owners, in their speeches, raised many opinions on the lack of supply and unreasonable distribution of goods. A small business owner from a foundry also reported that family members employed by the enterprise were not properly arranged after the enterprise's restructuring and requested the help of relevant leading departments to resolve this issue.

Mayor Chen Yi said in his speech that the Municipal People's Committee is responsible for the poor working relationship between the public and private sectors in some joint ventures, and that the education of public representatives is insufficient. He encouraged business representatives not to merely passively reflect opinions, and that they should raise problems encountered in their work at any time and take the initiative to solve them. He said that as long as it is in the interests of the country, they should "argue on the basis of reason and speak frankly and without reservation," and not be afraid of spoiling the relationship. Deputy Mayor Cao Diqiu said: This kind of symposium should be held regularly as a system in the future. The criticisms and opinions raised by the business community at this meeting can be immediately resolved by the relevant departments, and some will be answered by the competent authorities.

Our newspaper, Shenyang, 1st: The Liaoning Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium from July 28th to 31st, bringing together representatives from business circles and responsible persons from relevant government departments to exchange views on the transformation of private industry and commerce. More than 140 people attended the symposium, including chairmen and vice-chairmen of federations of industry and commerce from various cities and counties in Liaoning, as well as responsible personnel from government industrial and financial professional companies. Li Tao, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province, also participated in the symposium.

At the meeting, representatives from local federations of industry and commerce, in addition to reflecting the new atmosphere in production and management after public-private partnerships and cooperativization, also raised some opinions and criticisms on behalf of private personnel regarding issues such as public-private collaboration in enterprises, personnel arrangements, economic restructuring, and wages and welfare. Representatives from Shenyang, Anshan, Yingkou, and other places reported that in some enterprises, the public leaders do not give private personnel a free hand, do not explain policies, and private personnel cannot see policy instructions and documents related to business matters, and they do not attach importance to the adoption of private personnel's technology in production technology. It was suggested that in the future, meetings between public and private parties and business research meetings could be held, and that industrial and commercial departments should organize political training classes, technical training classes, and short-term business training classes for private personnel. Some representatives also reflected that some enterprises arranged private personnel in jobs where "what they learned and their strengths were not being used," and requested the government to make reasonable adjustments. At the symposium, 27 representatives from Shenyang, Dalian, Liaoyang, and other places spoke on behalf of 32 cities and counties.

On the last day of the symposium, Deputy Governor Li gave clear answers to the main issues raised by the representatives. On the issue of public-private collaboration in enterprises, he pointed out that public and private parties should work together and said that the government should further strengthen leadership in this regard, educate public representatives to actively unite private personnel to jointly manage enterprises well, but private personnel should also take a positive attitude and be responsible for the enterprise. Regarding personnel arrangements, he hoped that local federations of industry and commerce would conduct a detailed investigation of the unreasonable arrangements and then submit them to the relevant departments for active handling. In addition, he also gave clear answers to issues such as fixed interest rates on shares, wages and benefits, and participation in socialist competitions for private personnel. Subsequently, the heads of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce, the Department of Industry, and the Handicraft Production Cooperative also gave specific answers to the questions raised by the representatives. After the meeting, many business representatives reflected that through this symposium, they further understood the spirit of the government's policies and expressed their intention to work hard to promote the active acceptance of socialist transformation by capitalist personnel and to participate in socialist competitions.

    上海市和辽宁省举行工商界座谈会
    交换改进公私共事中的意见
    新华社上海2日电　上海市市长陈毅在七月三十一日和八月一日，邀请工商界人士举行座谈会。出席的工商界人士有盛丕华、胡厥文、荣毅仁等八十多人。中共上海市委员会第二书记陈丕显、上海市副市长曹荻秋、宋日昌、刘述周以及市人民委员会有关部门负责人也参加座谈。
    在一天半的座谈会上，共有二十三个工商界人士发言。他们来自不同行业的大、中、小企业，对合营企业中公私双方共事关系、工业生产、经济改组以及小业主的业务安排和生活问题等方面，提出了不少意见。他们在发言中，批评了政府工作中的缺点，也提出了改进的建议。棉纺工业吴振珊在发言中说：“有的合营厂公私双方人员一起工作，一起学习，关系很好；但有些合营厂公方代表有包揽一切的现象，对私方的职权尊重不够。”金瑞麒说，一般合营商店中，公私双方相敬如宾，十分客气，实际上这种现象并不是很正常的。小业主在发言中，对货源缺少和分配不合理提出了许多意见。还有一家翻砂厂的小业主，反映了企业改组以后没有很好安排家属从业人员，要求有关领导部门帮助解决。
    陈毅市长在会上发言说，有些合营企业中公私双方共事关系不好，对公方代表教育不够，市人民委员会是要负责的。他鼓励工商界人士不要仅仅被动地反映意见，今后遇到工作中的问题，应该随时提出，主动地来解决。他说，只要是为国家的利益着想，就应该“据理力争、直言无讳”，不要害怕关系搞坏。副市长曹荻秋说：这种座谈会，今后要作为一种制度，经常举行。这次会上工商界所提出的批评和意见，可以立刻解决的就交有关部门处理，有的将由主管部门解答。
    本报沈阳1日电　辽宁省人民委员会和省工商业联合会于七月二十八日到三十一日召开了工商界代表和政府有关部门负责人座谈会，交换对私营工商业改造问题的意见。参加座谈的有辽宁各个市县工商业联合会的正副主任委员、政府工业、财经专业公司负责人员一百四十多人。辽宁省副省长李涛也参加了这次座谈会。
    会上各地工商联的代表除了反映公私合营和合作化以后生产经营上的新气象外，并代表私方人员对企业公私共事、人事安排、经济改组、工资福利等问题提出了一些意见和批评。沈阳、鞍山、营口等地代表反映有的企业公方领导对私方人员使用不放手、不交代政策、有关业务方面的政策指示文件私方人员看不到，在生产技术上不重视采用私方人员的技术等。建议今后能召开一些公私双方碰头会，业务研究会，并要求工商业部门能为私方人员主办政治训练班、技术训练班及短期业务训练班等。有的代表还反映了部分企业安排私方人员“所学所长非所用”，要求政府给以合理调整。座谈会上，沈阳、旅大、辽阳等地二十七名代表先后代表了三十二个市县进行了发言。
    座谈会最后一天，李副省长就代表们提出的主要问题作了明确解答。在企业公私共事问题上，他指出要公私双方共同努力，并表示政府要进一步加强这方面的领导，教育公方代表主动团结私方人员共同管理好企业，但私方人员也应采取积极态度对企业负责。关于人事安排，他希望各地工商联详细调查一下安排不合理的情况，然后提交有关部门积极处理。此外对私方人员的定股定息、工资福利、参加社会主义竞赛等问题也都作了明确的解答。接着辽宁省商业厅、工业厅、手工业生产联社的负责人也分别就代表们提出的问题作了具体答复。会后许多工商业代表反映，通过这次座谈，进一步领会了政府的政策精神，纷纷表示回去后要努力推动资方人员积极接受社会主义改造，参加社会主义竞赛。
