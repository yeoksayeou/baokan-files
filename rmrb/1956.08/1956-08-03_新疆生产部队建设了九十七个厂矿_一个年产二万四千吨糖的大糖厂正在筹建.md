Xinhua News Agency:

The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is planning to build a large-scale mechanized sugar factory in the Manas River Basin reclamation area. Once completed, this sugar factory will have an annual output of 24,000 tons of sugar. This is the first sugar factory to be built in the Xinjiang region, and it is also the largest factory built by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps in Xinjiang in the past seven years. This sugar factory will be completed and put into production in 1959.

In the past seven years, the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has established 97 factories and mines of various kinds in Xinjiang, including tractor and automobile repair, power generation, coal, flour, oil extraction, leather, and confectionery food. In the past seven years, these factories and mines have accumulated a total production value of more than 240 million yuan for the country. Most of these factories and mines are located near the farms in various reclamation areas, which has played a significant role in ensuring the supply of production and living materials for the production corps and the local people of all ethnic groups. The five newly built tractor repair factories last year repaired 81 various tractors for the reclamation areas before this year's spring plowing production, ensuring the spring plowing and sowing work of the corps. The fifteen cotton ginning factories and seven oil extraction factories established in various parts of Xinjiang are all equipped with new-style cotton ginning and oil extraction equipment. The cotton and oil crops produced by local farmers of all ethnic groups are mostly processed in these factories.

    新疆生产部队建设了九十七个厂矿
    一个年产二万四千吨糖的大糖厂正在筹建
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队正在玛纳斯河流域垦区筹建一座大规模的机械化制糖厂。这座制糖厂建成后，可年产两万四千吨食糖。这是新疆地区修建的第一座制糖厂，也是新疆军区生产建设部队七年来在新疆兴建的规模最大的工厂。这个糖厂将在1959年建成投入生产。
    七年来，新疆军区生产建设部队已经在新疆各地建立了拖拉机、汽车修配、发电、煤炭、面粉、榨油、皮革、糖果副食等各种厂矿九十七个。七年来，这些厂矿已经为国家累积了生产总值两亿四千多万元的资金。这些厂矿大多建立在各垦区农场附近，对保证生产部队和当地各族人民的生产和生活资料的供应，起了很大作用。去年新建的五个拖拉机修理厂，在今年春耕生产前就为各垦区修理了八十一台各种拖拉机，保证了部队春耕播种工作。建立在新疆各地的十五个轧花厂和七个榨油等工厂，全是新式的轧花和榨油设备，当地各族农民生产的棉花和油料，大多在这些工厂加工制作。
