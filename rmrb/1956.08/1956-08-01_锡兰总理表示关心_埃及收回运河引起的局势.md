    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Colombo: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said in Parliament yesterday that Ceylon is concerned about the situation arising from the nationalization of the Suez Canal, because it affects its import and export trade. He revealed that Britain had suggested that all countries with direct or indirect relations with Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal hold a meeting in London. He said that there was no definite arrangement for the proposed meeting, but he had instructed Ceylon's High Commissioner in the United Kingdom to prepare to represent Ceylon at the meeting. He said: "I will consider whether it is necessary for Asian countries, especially the Colombo countries, or even the broader Bandung (Conference) countries, to hold emergency discussions due to this situation."
    He said that the news of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal was a complete surprise to him. He described Egypt's action as an event that "may threaten world peace."

    锡兰总理表示关心
    埃及收回运河引起的局势
    据新华社31日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克昨天在议会里说，锡兰关心由于苏彝士运河国有化而产生的局势，因为这对它的进出口贸易有影响。他透露英国已经建议所有同埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有有直接或间接关系的国家在伦敦举行会议。他说，这个建议中的会议还没有肯定的安排，但是他已经指示锡兰驻英国的高级专员准备代表锡兰参加这次会议。他说：“我将考虑亚洲国家、特别是科伦坡国家、甚至更广泛的万隆（会议）国家间是否有必要因这种局势而举行紧急讨论”。
    他说，埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的消息对他来说是完全意外的。他把埃及这一行动说成“也许是威胁着世界和平”的事件。
