Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st. Nehru reported to the People's Chamber of the Indian Parliament on July 31st regarding his recent visits to some European countries, saying that the issues he discussed with the Egyptian President and ministers in Cairo "were not related to the Suez Canal or any aspect of Anglo-Egyptian relations. The Egyptian government's recent decision on the Suez Canal was something I only learned about from newspaper reports after returning to Delhi."

The Indian Prime Minister, in discussing the Brioni meeting, said that he, the Yugoslav President, and the Egyptian President had already "expressed our shared understanding of the growing desire for peace and active coexistence, the problem of the world today being divided into blocs due to fear, and the indispensable need for gradual disarmament and an immediate cessation of nuclear explosions" in the trilateral joint statement.

Nehru said, "We declared our common belief that the cooperation of the People's Republic of China is indispensable for solving the problems concerning the Far East."

In his speech to the People's Chamber, Prime Minister Nehru first spoke about the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference he had recently attended. In explaining the communique of this conference, he said, "As a result of personal contact and exchange of views, we gained a beneficial, rational, and realistic understanding of the developments in various aspects within the Soviet Union. These developments were considered 'significant' and were welcomed. It was recognized that improved relations between the Soviet Union and other major powers would help eliminate the fear of war and promote peace."

Nehru said, "Furthermore, there was a common recognition of the significant importance of Asia in today's world and the situations in the Middle East and the Far East. It was recognized that a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan area issue is necessary to achieve stability and eliminate the danger of conflict that could frustrate hopes for peace."

Nehru spoke about his visits to various countries in Europe and the Middle East, and the warm reception he and his party received from the governments and people of those countries, saying that this "constantly reminded us of the tasks before us, and made me see that our country, in the short time since gaining freedom, has already aroused widespread and profound expectations among the people of the world." Nehru said, "The enthusiasm of the people, their hope for understanding and friendship, their response to our (India's) attitude towards peace and cooperation issues, the universal recognition of a resurgent Asia – all of these are very gratifying."

Nehru concluded by saying, "The advancing pace of history has linked the continents together; however, sharp struggles and conflicts still divide them. The heavy pressure of deadly weapons and the threat of atomic destruction make peaceful coexistence the only path for human survival in the near future. My conversations with people and governments in various countries during my travels have convinced me of this. I have realized that this is our most urgent need today. For this, we need goodwill and tolerance among nations. We will be able to make our greatest contribution with our example and our consistent efforts to promote peace and cooperation."

    尼赫鲁谈出国访问的观感
    更生的亚洲受到普遍承认
    世界和平需要各国间的善意和容忍
    据新华社新德里1日电　尼赫鲁七月三十一日在印度国会人民院报告他最近在欧洲一些国家访问经过的时候说，他在开罗同埃及总统和部长们讨论的问题“同苏彝士运河或者英埃关系的任何方面都是没有关系的。埃及政府最近关于苏彝士运河的决定是我回到德里以后才从报纸的报道中知道的”。
    这位印度总理在谈到布里俄尼会谈的时候说，他同南斯拉夫总统和埃及总统已经在三国联合声明中“对希望和平和积极共处的日益增长的愿望、对世界今天由于恐惧分裂成为集团这一问题、以及逐步裁军和立即停止核子爆炸这种必不可少的需要，表示了我们的共同的了解。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我们宣布了我们的共同信念，认为要解决有关远东的问题，中华人民共和国的合作是不可缺少的。”
    尼赫鲁总理在人民院的演说中首先谈到的是他在不久以前参加的英联邦总理会议。他在阐释这个会议的公报的时候说：“个人接触和交换意见的结果，使我们对苏联国内的各个方面的发展得到了有益的合理的、现实的了解。这些发展被认为是‘意义重大’的，并且受到了欢迎。大家承认，苏联同其他大国之间的关系如果得到改进，将会有助于消除战争恐惧和促进和平。
    尼赫鲁说：“此外，大家还共同认识到亚洲在今天世界中的重大意义和中东及远东的局势。大家认识到，和平解决台湾地区问题对求得稳定和消除那种会发生挫折和平希望的冲突的危险来说，是必要的。”
    尼赫鲁谈到他在欧洲和中东各国访问的经过，以及各国政府和人民对他和他的一行的热情招待说，这“经常向我们提醒摆在我们面前的任务，并且使我看到我们的国家在获得自由后的短短时间内已经在世界各国人民中引起广泛而深厚的期望。”尼赫鲁说：“各国人民的热情，他们的希望谅解和友谊，他们对我们（印度）对和平和合作问题的态度的反应，对更生的亚洲的普遍承认——所有这些都是非常令人高兴的。”
    尼赫鲁最后说：“历史的前进步伐已经把各大洲连在一起；但是，尖锐的斗争和冲突仍旧分裂着它们。致命的武器和原子破坏的威胁的沉重压力使和平共处成为在不久的将来人类生存的唯一道路。在我旅行期间同各国人民和政府的交谈中使我相信这点。我已经认识到这就是今天我们最迫切的需要。为此我们需要国家间的善意和容忍。我们以我们的榜样和我们为促进和平和合作的始终不渝的努力将能够作出我们最大的贡献。
