    Sparks
    (Baotou Dispatch)
    Special Correspondent for this newspaper: Tian Jian
    I.
    One li away from the train station, there stands a red building, a three-story structure, imposing on one side of the street.
    Those who arrive in Baotou and live in the building would never imagine that they are living above the Yellow River. Who would think that beneath this building once flowed a channel of the Yellow River, which ran here many years ago?
    The name Baotou comes from the Mongolian word "Baoketu," which means deer. Why is this place called Deer? Originally, there were few people and many deer here. Deer often drank water at the Three Springs. It is said that an emperor hunted here, shot deer, and used the word "deer" as the name for this place.
    At the end of the 17th century, this was a vast grassland. Later, because of the establishment of a postal station, people settled here. From that time until before Liberation, what a long period it was. In this history, the old rulers left us with only an earthen city. In 1950, it had only seventeen streetlights.
    Moreover, this earthen city was also stained with blood. In its earliest days, Baotou's appearance was just like that described in the well-known ancient song – "The Charioteer's Song."
    In recent years, it has undergone earth-shaking changes. But more significant changes are yet to come. A brand-new steel city will soon appear before our eyes. Standing in the red building, we lift the blue curtains, open the window, and look: the roaring trucks, loaded with timber, steel bars, iron plates, and bricks, make a turn on the street and then speed towards the left.
    Where is the left? –
    On that side is a grassland. There, in 1955, there were only a few scattered villages with mud-plastered roofs and mud-piled courtyard walls. The residents here are being relocated in batches to the banks of the Yellow River. Several villagers are moving. They lead a white horse, squeezing next to the cart:
    "Just leave the plow behind. You'll be moving back in a couple of days."
    The first group of construction workers who arrived here, including Master Shen, saw that they were still preparing to move back before leaving. He asked the villagers:
    "What's wrong? Isn't the Hetao area better than the grassland? Why do you want to move back? Are you unwilling to move?"
    "What's there to be unwilling about? We're moving to a place with water – what could be better than that?"
    "Then why are your eyes still fixed on this place; you must still have some concerns, some unspoken words in your hearts. Tell us, tell us."
    "We want to ask you: what are you going to do here? Are you building a factory? Are you making steel? But, have you seen this place? What kind of place is it? What can you do here? How many houses are you going to build? The grass doesn't even grow tall here. Besides, there's no water. There are only a few wells in dozens of miles. We're worried about you –"
    "So you don't believe in us, and you're worried about us. It's okay, we will definitely install electric lights here. We're not building a few houses; we're going to build buildings, factories, and make steel."
    Bricklayer Shen Qingxuan replied. He also pointed to a twenty-year-old apprentice and said, "This is my son. I specifically brought him here to build this place. I called him from Beijing. This is our home now. In a few days, please come back and visit."
    II.
　 A grass-green tent is pitched in the sandpit. Master Shen, the bricklayer, holding a large shovel, walks out of the tent. He looks around, and at this time, his confidence isn't as firm as he said. He feels a little cold. Because the reality is that, apart from a few dozen workers and a batch of bricks and tiles, there is nothing else here.
    "What kind of place is this? An empty space. Where should the first brick be placed? Where do we build the factory?" he asks Director Li.
    Li Ting, the director of this construction site, tells him: "We'll build the factory right here. We're going to turn a grassland into a steel city. After we build hundreds of residential buildings and auxiliary factories, we'll build the main factory building. Right now, we don't know if the main factory building will be located at the east end or the west end. The designers are still arguing about this. Soviet experts and managers are still discussing: where is the best location for the Baotou Iron and Steel Company's factory site?"
    Choosing such a factory site is indeed not simple. Wind direction, water source, transportation, and whether to connect it with the old city of Baotou, all have to be considered. At that time, Director Li, according to the blueprint, pointed to a spot on the grassland and asked Master Shen to lay the first brick: "First build a stove and a canteen. We'll wait for the manager's instructions for other plans."
    After a blue brick is placed on the ground, there is still no water. The people in the village also need water for the few plots of land they have cultivated on the grassland. Water conservancy committee member, old man Gao Xiwang, is standing beside a small canal waiting for water. He waits there day and night. Director Li looks for water everywhere and finds it at the water conservancy committee. "Can we use a little of your water?"
    "What for?"
    "For building houses."
    "No."
    "Can we borrow a little? We'll return it to you after we dig a well, okay?"
    "That won't work either."
    The old man manages the water in the village. He takes this responsibility very seriously. He knows that water is as precious as gold in this place. Where can you get water to build houses? As for digging a well, he also knows that it's not a matter of days or even dozens of days. So he repeatedly refuses. Director Li stands there like a wooden chicken for a long time. He still doesn't despair. He thinks the old man might be able to spare a few cartloads of water, right? The old man waits for water while grumbling:
    "We have fought with other villages many times over this canal. The reason for the fights is water. Once, people from two villages went to the canal with shovels and axes, facing each other, neither willing to give way.
    "That was in 1942. Japanese police also rushed here from Machi. They didn't care about anyone's life or death; they came and opened fire. They fired two shots. The first shot was fired into the sky. The second shot landed in the crowd, hitting someone… Comrade, let me tell you: on this grassland, water is like blood."
    The water hasn't come down yet. The canal is dry. A wave suddenly surges in the old man's heart: "If we really build some new houses in this place, that would be a big deal; even if the water is blood, we should load a few carts and send it to the country." He shouts:
    "Comrade, don't worry. About borrowing water, wait until I go back to the village tonight and discuss it with them."
    Director Li is still young, around thirty years old, an intellectual, and good at writing short stories. He has a whole book of short stories. Therefore, he understands the old man's character. This old man's heart is a well; as long as you put the bucket down, you can draw water, which is more reliable than that dry canal.
    "Old man, have you been to Bayan Obo?"
    "I haven't been there. I've heard of such a good place where they produce iron."
    "The reason we are building houses here is to smelt the stones from there into steel here."
    The old man is half skeptical. Director Li takes out something from his leather bag, a small piece of black ore. Then he says:
    "Please take a look, what is this?"
    "This is iron," the old man says in surprise.
    "Please take a closer look, what exactly is it?"
    "I think this is a piece of pig iron."
    "It's not iron, it's ore, Bayan Obo ore."
    "However you say it, it's still the same as iron." The old man holds a pebble in one hand and this piece of ore in the other, comparing them, weighing them: "This treasure is twice as heavy as the stone." His face at this time is also like ore, revealing black and shiny colorful patterns, and his pupils shoot out sparks.
    "So it's you, you really want to make steel in this place?"
    III.
    "Really. This is the country's plan. The Baotou Iron and Steel Company is going to be established in your area. Haven't you heard of it, or don't you believe it?"
    "None of us here believe it. How many houses are you planning to build?"
    "Not a few houses, not even hundreds, but thousands. Like the Ural Mountains. Water is really not enough. When it comes to making steel, even the Yellow River's water won't be enough. The water underground has to be pumped up."
    "You'll use the Yellow River's water?"
    "We're going to divert the Yellow River's water here, lay iron pipes, all the way from the Yellow River bank to here. This is a big project. You probably don't even believe this, do you?"
    Director Li and the old man stand on the canal, looking around. The sky is nearing dusk. Milk-white flocks of sheep pass by them. Far away, there is a cart pulled by oxen, rolling on the grass.
    They are hunters returning from afar. They are dressed as two young women, wearing red clothes, holding shotguns in their arms, sitting on the cart. Geese are very alert birds. When they see something suspicious, they fly very high and very fast. So the hunters dress up as young women to lure them.
    The vast grassland that stretches as far as the eye can see is particularly beautiful in this season. It is covered with blue and gold flowers. What a wonderful place, a golden and silver land! Unfortunately, for thousands of years, it has been lying there, unable to stand up. Although it has countless treasures, various rare metals, they are buried underground, unable to show their brilliance. It is both rich and poor. This contradiction, this heavy contradiction, is time to resolve it!
    The old man pulls Director Li, asking him to say a few more words, what exactly will this place become?
    Director Li points to where they are standing and says, "Take this canal, for example, it will become a street in the future, or a special railway line will be built here. The dry Kunyoulun River in front will also be filled. Around us, seven or eight small train stations will be built. The city will be surrounded by railways, and the railways, like the veins on a leaf, will connect in all directions. A new city will rise from this grassland. The grassland will no longer be asleep; it will rise up with it.
    "Currently, this is an open space, but soon, it will be a large city with three or four hundred thousand, or five or six hundred thousand people. This date is not far away. You and I will be able to see it soon. You and I will reach out and build it ourselves."
    "If that's the case, I will reach out with both hands. However, what you're telling me, is it a story, or a myth you heard from somewhere?"
    "What I'm talking about is our country's and the Party's great Five-Year Plan. I'm talking about our construction plan. The tents we live in have already been set up here, and next to them are bricks and tiles. In a few days, you will see tens of thousands of workers coming here."
    "Won't that become another world?"
    "This world is new; it is socialist."
    On the evening of their conversation, water conservancy committee member, old man Gao, along with the village cadres, carrying a red lantern, hurry to the front of the tents. The old man shouts loudly:
    "The water in the canal is here. There's water! There's water!"

    火花
    （包头通信）
    本报特约记者  田间
    一  
    和车站相隔一里地，有一座红楼，这一座三层高的楼房，巍然地立在大街的一侧。
    初到包头，住在楼上的人，无论如何也想不到，他是住在黄河的上面。——谁能想到，在这楼房的下面，曾经是黄河的一条水道，多年以前，黄河就在这里流过。
    包头这个地名，蒙古语叫做“包克图”。包克图就是鹿。为什么这里叫做鹿呢？原来以前这块地方人很少、鹿很多，常有鹿在三股泉那里喝水。据说，有一位皇帝在这里打过猎，射过鹿，并且拿鹿这个字做了这里的地名。
    十七世纪末叶，这里就是一块大草原。后来因为有了驿站，才有人在这里定居下来。从那时候起，直到解放以前，是多么长的一段时间呵。在这一段历史上，旧日的统治者给我们留下的，竟然是一座土城。1950年，它只有十七盏路灯。
    而且，在这座土城上，也是血迹斑斑的。最早，包头这个地方，它的面目，正是像我们所熟知的一首古歌——“敕勒歌”所描写的那样。
    这几年来，它有了惊天动地的变化。但是更重要的变化，还在前面。一座崭新的钢城，很快就要出现在我们的眼前。我们站在红楼上，掀起蓝色的窗帘，把窗户打开，看吧：奔腾的卡车，装着木材、钢筋、铁板和砖瓦，轰轰地响着，在大街上，拐了一个弯，接着就向左边那个方向急速地奔去。
    左边是哪里？——
    那边是一块草原。在那边，1955年，只有几个零星的村庄，黄土抹的屋顶，黄土堆的院墙。这里的住户，正在分批迁移，要搬到黄河边上去。几个老乡，正在搬家。他们牵着一匹白马，挤到车子旁边：
    “把犁杖丢着吧。过两天又要往回搬的。”
    第一批来到这里的建筑工人，有一位沈师傅，看到他们临走以前，还要准备往回搬的样子。就问这些老乡：
     “怎么啦，河套不比草原还好吗？你们为什么还要往回搬呢。是不乐意挪动吧？”
    “有什么不乐意的。我们搬到有水的地方去了——。还有什么比这好。”
    “那是为什么，你们的眼睛还在钉着这块地方；你们一定还有什么问题，还有什么心上的话没有讲出口来。讲吧，讲出来吧。”
    “我们想问一问你们：你们到这里来，要做什么，是建厂吗？是炼钢吗？可是，你们看过没有，这是什么地方呀。你们能在这里做什么，要盖几间房子？这里的草也长不高的。另外，也没有水。几十里的地方，不过才有几口井。我们是为你们担心。——”
    “原来你们是不相信我们，替我们担心。不要紧，我们一定要在这里安起电灯。不是盖几间房子，是要盖楼，建厂，炼钢。”
    瓦工沈庆萱这么回答。他又指着一个二十岁的徒工说：“这是我的儿子。为了建设这个地方，我特意把他带来了。从北京叫来的。这就是我们大家的家了。过几天，请你们回到家里来看看。”
    二
　  一座草绿色的帐篷，在沙窝子里撑起来。瓦工沈师傅，手里拿着一把大铲，走出帐篷来。他四下里一望，这时候，他的信心也并不像他说的那样硬。身上有点发冷。因为实际上是，这里除了来了几十个工人和一批砖瓦而外，别的什么也没有。
      “这是个什么地方？空荡荡的一片。第一块砖该摆在哪里，我们在哪里建厂？”他问李主任。
    这个工地的主任李汀，告诉他：“就在这里建厂。我们要把一块草地变做一座钢城。等到把几百幢住宅、附属工厂盖好以后，再盖主厂房。现在，还不知道主厂房究竟是立在东头，还是立在西头，设计家们还在争论这个问题，苏联专家和经理们还在讨论：包头钢铁公司的厂址选在哪里好呢？”
    选择这样的一个厂址，确实并不简单，风向、水源、交通，和包头旧城要不要连成一片等等，都得要考虑到。当时，李主任按照蓝图，在草原上指着一个地点，请沈师傅摆好那第一块砖：“先砌炉灶，盖一个食堂，其他的计划，我们再等候经理的指示。”
    一块青色的砖，在地面上摆好以后，水还是没有。村里的人，在草原上开垦的几块地，也正需要水。水利委员高希旺老汉，站在一条小渠旁边等水。白天和黑夜，他都在那里等着。李主任到处找水，找到水利委员那里。“这里的水，我们能使唤一点吗？”
    “做什么用？”
    “盖房子用。”
    “不行。”
    “我们借一点。等我们打好井以后，再归还给你们还不行吗？”
    “那也不行。”
    老头子在村里是管理水的。他把这个责任看得很大。他知道这个地方水同金子一样贵。哪里有水来盖房子。至于打井，他也知道，不是几天、也不是几十天的事情。所以他一再拒绝。李主任呆如木鸡，站了半天。他仍然没有绝望。他想老头子或者可以转让几车水的吧？老头子一面等水，一面唠叨：
    “在这一条水渠上，我们曾同别的村子打过多次架。打架的原因，就是为了水。有一次，两个村子的人，扛上铁锹，提着斧头，一起上了渠，针锋相对，谁也不让谁。
    “那是1942年，日本警察也从麻池赶到这里。谁的死活他都不管；来了，就开枪。打了两枪。头一枪打在天上。第二枪落在人群里，打中了一个人。……同志，我对你说吧：在这个草场子上，水和鲜血一样。”
    水还没有下来。水渠是干的。老头子的心上，倒忽然涌起一阵浪花：“如果真的是在这个地方盖起几间新房子，那倒是一件大事；尽管水是鲜血，也要装几车送给国家。”他叫了一声：
    “同志，不要急。借水的事，等我晚上回去同村里研究一下。”
    李主任还很年青，三十岁上下，是个知识分子，很会写小故事。小故事写的有一大本。因此，他懂得老头子的性格。这个老头子的心，是一口井，只要把水桶放下去，就能打出水来，比那干巴巴的水渠要可靠。
    “老汉，你到过白云鄂博没有？”
    “没有到过。听说过有这么一个好地方，那里是出铁的。”
    “我们在这里盖房子，就是要把那里的石头放在这里炼成钢”。
    老头子半信半疑。李主任从皮囊里找出一件东西，一小块黑的矿石。接着他说：
    “请你看一看，这是什么？”
    “这就是铁呀。”老头子很惊奇地说。
    “请你再仔细地看一眼，它到底是啥？”
    “我看这是一块生铁。”
    “它不是铁，是矿石，白云鄂博的矿石。”
    “怎么说，它也是和铁一样。”老头子一手拿着一颗卵石，又一手拿着这块矿石，两边对比了一下，掂了掂斤两：“这个宝贝比石头重一倍呵。”他的脸上这时也像矿石似的，露着黑灿灿的彩纹，眼瞳里射出了火花。
    “原来就是你们，真的要在这地方炼钢？”
    三
    “真的。这是国家的计划。包头钢铁公司，就要立在你们这个地方。是你们没有听说到，还是你们不相信？”
    “我们这里的人，没有一个相信的。你们打算盖几间房子？”
    “不是几间房子，也不是几百间，是几千座。像乌拉山似的。水，实在是不够用的。到炼钢的时候，黄河的水也不够用。这地下的水，都得提升上来。”
    “要用黄河的水？”
    “我们要把黄河的水引到这里，把铁管子铺起来，从黄河边一直铺到这里。这是一件大工程。光是这一点，你们也不信吧？”
    李主任和老汉，两个人站在水渠上，望着四周。天色已近黄昏。乳白的羊群，从他们的身边穿过。远远地有一挂牛车，在青草上滚着。
    那是打雁的人，从远方归来。他们扮成两个姑娘，穿得红通通的，怀里抱着火枪，坐在车子上。大雁这种鸟，是很机警的，当它看见形迹可疑的东西，它飞得很高，也飞得很快。所以猎人扮成了姑娘，要诱惑它。
    一眼望不到头的广阔的草地，在这个季节里，特别的美丽。它开满了蓝的花和金的花。多么好的地方呵，这是一块金银地！不幸的是，几千年来，它一直是伏在那里，站不起身来。虽说它有数不清的宝藏、有各种稀有的金属，但是，它埋在地下，露不出光芒。它又是富庶的，它又是贫穷的。这样一种矛盾，沉重的矛盾，是解决的时候了！
    老头子把李主任拉住，要他再多讲几句，这个地方，究竟要变成什么样子。
    李主任指着他们站的地方，说：“拿这条水渠来说吧，以后它就要变成一条街道，或者要在这里筑起一条专线铁路，前面的那条干巴巴的昆犹仑河，也要把它填平。在我们的四面，要建筑七、八个小火车站，环城都是铁路，铁路像一片树叶子上的脉络一样，四面八方，沟通起来。一座新的城市，就要从这个草原上站起来。草原不再是睡着，它会跟着站起来。
    “目前这里是一块空地，不久以后，这里就是一个大的城市，要有三、四十万，或者五、六十万的人口。这个日期也不远。你和我，马上就能看得见。你和我，要伸出手来，亲自来建设它。”
    “要是这样，我要伸出双手。不过，你对我说的，是一个故事，还是你从什么地方听来的一个神话呢？”
    “我说的是我们祖国和党的伟大的五年计划。说的是我们施工的计划。我们住的帐篷，已经在这里扎下，它旁边就是砖和瓦。过几天，你就会看到，几万工人要开到这里来。”
    “那不是变成另外的一个世界了？”
    “这个世界是新的，是社会主义。”
    在他们谈话的这天晚上，水利委员高老汉，同村干部们一道，打着一个红灯笼，急急忙忙地走到帐篷前面。老头子大声地喊着：
  “渠上的水下来了。有水了！有水了！”
