    Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser held a press conference and delivered a radio address on the 12th, formally announcing the Egyptian government's refusal to participate in the London Conference and condemning the attempt by Britain, France, and the United States to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs in the communiqué of the tripartite talks. President Nasser also suggested convening a large-scale international conference to consider concluding a new agreement to guarantee the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal. President Nasser's solemn statement clearly demonstrated the Egyptian government and people's determination to safeguard national sovereignty and interests, and their sincere desire to resolve the complex situation arising from the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company through peaceful consultation. The Chinese people warmly support the Egyptian government's just stand and its sincere desire to seek a peaceful resolution of international disputes.
    The Egyptian government's refusal to participate in the London Conference is out of consideration for safeguarding national sovereignty and dignity. This action of the Egyptian government will be understood and supported by all countries and peoples who respect Egypt's independent sovereignty. Egypt is the country most closely related to the Suez Canal issue. The sovereignty of the Suez Canal belongs to Egypt, and it has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. No country should or has the right to interfere. Now, Britain, France, and the United States, without consulting the Egyptian government in advance, unilaterally decided to convene the London Conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue, and attempted to propose a so-called "international control" plan for the Suez Canal at the London Conference in order to deprive the Egyptian people of their legitimate right to reclaim the Suez Canal Company. The actions of Britain, France, and the United States, disregarding Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, are clearly unacceptable to the Egyptian government and people. It is only natural that the Egyptian government refused to participate in the London Conference.
    In his statement, the Egyptian President stated that Egypt is willing to join other countries that signed the 1888 Convention of Constantinople in initiating an international conference with broad participation of countries whose ships pass through the Suez Canal, in order to reconsider the Convention of Constantinople and reach an agreement that affirms and guarantees the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal. As everyone knows, after announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the Egyptian government has already guaranteed the freedom of navigation of the canal, and now it has proposed convening such a conference, which fully demonstrates the sincere desire of the Egyptian government and people to peacefully resolve international disputes. President Nasser's proposal is fully consistent with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and the resolution of the Asian-African Conference on resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation.
    President Nasser adopted a calm and reasonable attitude in both the statement he made at the press conference and his radio address. He explained in detail from a legal point of view the just position of Egypt in nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, and refuted the attempts of Britain, France, and the United States to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. The attitude taken by President Nasser demonstrates the valuable spirit of the Egyptian government to strive to resolve international disputes through peaceful consultation, which has won the praise of the reporters attending the reception, and will surely win the sympathy and support of people all over the world. This stands in stark contrast to the unreasonable, even abusive and personal attacks, adopted by some Western heads of state on the Suez Canal issue.
    Facts have proved that since the Egyptian government took over the Suez Canal Company, not only can ships of all countries navigate freely, but also the number of ships passing through has increased significantly. Any excuse used by Britain, France, and the United States to interfere in Egypt's just action of nationalizing the canal company is untenable, and any improper measures they take to attempt to infringe upon Egypt's national sovereignty will be of no avail. The wisest course of action for Western countries is to abandon all attempts to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, and to seek ways to peacefully resolve this international dispute on the basis of full respect for Egypt's sovereignty. For the time being, they should first avoid taking any actions at the upcoming London Conference that may have adverse consequences.

    埃及的正义立场和建设性的建议
    埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔十二日举行记者招待会并发表广播演说，正式宣布埃及政府拒绝参加伦敦会议，并谴责英、法、美在三国会谈公报中企图干涉埃及内政。纳赛尔总统同时建议召开一个大规模的国际会议，来考虑缔结一项新的协定，保证苏彝士运河的自由航行。纳赛尔总统的严正声明，清楚地表明了埃及政府和人民决心维护国家主权和利益，并希望在和平协商的基础上解决苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后所产生的复杂局势。中国人民热烈支持埃及政府的这一正义立场和它寻求和平解决国际争端的真诚愿望。
    埃及政府拒绝参加伦敦会议是出于维护国家主权和尊严的考虑，埃及政府的这个行动，是会得到一切尊重埃及独立主权的国家和人民的谅解和支持的。埃及是同苏彝士运河问题最有利害关系的国家，苏彝士运河的主权属于埃及，它完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，任何国家都不应该也无权加以干涉。现在，英、法、美三国事先根本不同埃及政府磋商，就片面决定召开伦敦会议来讨论苏彝士运河问题，并企图在伦敦会议上提出所谓“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划，以剥夺埃及人民收回苏彝士运河公司的合法权利。英、法、美三国这种不顾埃及主权和尊严的做法，显然是埃及政府和人民所不能接受的，埃及政府拒绝参加伦敦会议，这是理所当然的。
    埃及总统在他的声明中表示，埃及愿意同签订1888年君士坦丁堡公约的其它国家一道，发起召开一个有船只通过苏彝士运河的国家广泛参加的国际会议，以便重新考虑君士坦丁堡公约，并且达成一项肯定和保证苏彝士运河的自由航行的协定。大家知道，埃及政府在宣布苏彝士运河公司国有化以后，本已保证了运河的航行自由，现在又提出召开这样一个会议，这就充分地表现了埃及政府和人民和平解决国际争端的真诚愿望。纳赛尔总统的这个建议是同联合国宪章和亚非会议关于用和平协商方式解决国际争端的决议的精神完全一致的。
    纳赛尔总统无论在记者招待会上发表的声明和他的广播演说中，都采取了心平气和的冷静的说理态度。他详尽地从法律的观点，阐明了埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的正义立场，驳斥了英、法、美三国干涉埃及内政的企图。纳赛尔总统采取的这种态度，表现了埃及政府争取用和平协商方法解决国际争端的可贵精神，已经博得了参加招待会的记者们的赞誉，而且必将得到世界各国人民的同情和支持。这同西方国家一些首脑人物在苏彝士运河问题上所采取的不讲道理的、甚至谩骂和进行人身攻击的态度，恰成鲜明的对照。
    事实已经证明，埃及政府接管苏彝士运河公司以后，不但各国的船只可以自由航行，而且通行的船只有了明显的增加。英、法、美三国用任何借口来干涉埃及把运河公司国有化的正义行动，都是站不住脚的，它们采取的企图侵犯埃及国家主权的任何不正当措施，都是无济于事的。西方国家最明智的办法，是放弃一切干涉埃及内政的企图，并且在充分尊重埃及主权的基础上寻求和平解决这一问题的国际争端的途径，而就目前来说，他们首先应该在即将举行的伦敦会议上，避免采取可能产生不良后果的一切行动。
