    Popularization
    To buy a pair of shoes, I went to several shoe stores, but I left disappointed. The reason for my disappointment was that my feet were criticized.
    The shoe stores all had sizes 37 and 38. Finally, I asked the salesperson at the No. 1 outlet of the Jinan Handicraft Cooperative: Did they have any larger shoes? The salesperson shook his head and said: These are the most "popular." I didn't have the courage to cut my feet to fit the shoes, so I had to come back wearing shoes that exposed my toes. I didn't expect that sticking out individually would also lead to great suffering.

    大众化
    我为买一双鞋，跑了几家鞋店，结果是乘兴而来，败兴而返。所以败兴，是由于我的脚受到了批评。
    几家鞋店都是三七、三八两号鞋。最后我问济南市手工业合作社第一门市部的营业员：是否还有大一点的鞋？营业员摇了摇头说：这样是最“大众化”的了。我既没有削足适屦的勇气，只好仍穿着露脚指头的鞋回来。没想到脚指头搞个人突出，也是要大吃苦头的。
