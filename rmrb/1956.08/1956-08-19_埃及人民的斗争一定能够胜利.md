    The struggle of the Egyptian people will surely be victorious
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

    Since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, all people who uphold justice have cheered for it. Only the leaders of the three "free world" countries, Britain, France, and the United States, have completely lost their composure, abandoned their disguise, openly exerted economic pressure on Egypt, intimidated the Egyptian people, and slandered the Egyptian leaders in every possible way, thus thoroughly exposing their ugly faces as colonialists to the people of the world.

    Justice is entirely on the side of the Egyptian people.

    From a legal point of view, as Prime Minister Nehru pointed out, "The Suez Canal itself is in Egypt and is an inseparable part of Egypt. Therefore, Egypt's sovereignty is beyond doubt."

    From a moral point of view, the Suez Canal was dug by the hands of the Egyptian people. It embodies the labor of countless Egyptians and the lives of 120,000 Egyptians. The canal water flows with the blood and tears of the Egyptian people. For a hundred years, colonialists have seized countless profits from the canal, while the Egyptian government has even stated that it will compensate shareholders when nationalizing the canal. Could anything be fairer than this? The colonialists, however, say that Egypt "seized" other people's property. This is truly a "pirate's theory"!

    If Britain, France, and the United States are really only concerned about their own legitimate navigation interests, then Egypt has not only made solemn guarantees regarding the free passage of the canal, but the facts have also shown that free passage has not been hindered in the slightest. At the same time, the Egyptian government also plans to take a large portion of the canal's revenue to improve the canal's capacity. What other excuses do the colonialists have? Isn't it more reasonable to say that the Suez Canal has a blood-like vital relationship with the Egyptian people, and that it affects the happiness of the Egyptian people and their descendants?

    However, the leaders of Britain, France, and the United States are making a big fuss about this, saying things like "a matter of life and death for us all," "related to the fate of Western European industry," and the "international nature" of the canal, etc., stirring up anti-Egyptian sentiment among the people and creating excuses for armed intervention and forceful seizure for themselves. For the Chinese people who have suffered bullying, this logic sounds very familiar. Didn't the Japanese militarists in the 1930s chant that Northeast and North China were their "lifelines"?

    The Egyptian people, who have already won their independence, are determined to further break free from the shackles of unequal treaties. This is very easy for the Chinese people, who have only recently completely shattered the oppression of imperialism, to understand. The heroic and bold voice of the Egyptian people has especially stirred the hearts of the Chinese people. Each of us cares about the just struggle of the Egyptian people with infinite respect. As Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people fully support Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company." We firmly stand on the side of the Egyptian people.

    The Egyptian people's just struggle is invincible. We advise the imperialists not to play with fire and burn themselves.

    The Egyptian brothers, supported by peace-loving people all over the world, will surely be victorious!

    埃及人民的斗争一定能够胜利
    中国民主促进会主席　马叙伦
    埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有以后，一切主持正义的人们都为之欢呼。只有英、法、美三个“自由世界”的首领完全丧失了镇静，抛掉了伪装，公开对埃及施用经济压力，对埃及人民进行恫吓，对埃及领袖百般诬蔑，因此也就在全世界人民面前彻底暴露了自己殖民主义者的丑恶的面目。
    正义完全在埃及人民这一边。
    从法律观点上看，正如尼赫鲁总理所指出的，“苏彝士运河本身在埃及，并且是埃及的不可分割的一部分。因此，埃及的主权是毫无疑问的”。
    从道义上看，苏彝士运河是埃及人用双手开凿出来的，它包含有无数埃及人的劳动和十二万埃及人的生命，河水里流着埃及人民的血泪。百年来殖民主义者从运河攫取了无数的利润，而埃及政府在收归国有时还声明对股票持有者给予补偿，天下还能比这再公道么？殖民主义者却说成好像埃及“夺取了”别人的财产，这真是“海盗的理论”！
    如果英、法、美真只是关心本国的正当的航行利益，那么埃及不但对于运河的自由通航早已作出庄严的保证，而且事实已经说明自由通航丝毫未受到妨碍，同时埃及政府还计划从运河收入中拿出一大部分款项来改善运河的通过能力。殖民主义者还有什么借口呢？说苏彝士运河与埃及人民有血肉般的利害关系，它影响着埃及人民子孙的幸福不是更有道理么？
    但是，英、法、美三国领导人却在这里大作其文章，说什么“对我们全体是个生死问题”，什么“关乎西欧工业的命运”，什么运河的“国际性质”等等，在人民中间煽动反埃及的情绪，为自己武装干涉，强取豪夺制造借口。对于曾经饱受欺凌的中国人民说来，这种逻辑听起来是很熟悉的，三十年代的日本军国主义者不是高唱过我国东北、华北是他们的“生命线”么？
    已经争得了独立的埃及人民决心进一步摆脱不平等条约的束缚，这对于不久前方才彻底粉碎了帝国主义压迫的中国人民是非常容易理解的。埃及人民英勇豪迈的声音特别激动了中国人民的心，我们每一个人都怀着无限敬意关怀着埃及人民的正义斗争。正如周恩来总理所说：“中国人民完全支持埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化”。我们坚决地站在埃及人民这一边。
    埃及人民的正义斗争是不可战胜的，我们劝告帝国主义者不要玩火自焚。
    受到全世界爱好和平人民的支持的埃及弟兄一定能够胜利！
