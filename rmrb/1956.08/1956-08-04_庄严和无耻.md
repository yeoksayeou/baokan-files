    Solemnity and Shamelessness

    The propaganda machine of the American bourgeoisie frequently slanders the Communist Party for not respecting cultural heritage, while portraying themselves as the guardians of cultural heritage. However, lies cannot conceal the truth. Not long ago, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan, admitted in a speech at a gathering in New York: "There are few countries in the world that respect artists, writers, composers, or thinkers as little as our country."

    I have two pictures at hand: one is the portrait of a young woman painted by the famous Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci – "Mona Lisa." The art master created a beautiful, moving, and lifelike image of a woman for us, giving people a sense of beauty. The other is selected from the 1955 "American Photography Annual," which completely distorts da Vinci's original painting, changing the face and hands to those of a man. The picture shows a grotesque, hideous appearance. Such a trampling of a work of art is actually praised as a "masterpiece" and a "high degree of special effects"!

    If these two pictures are placed together, it is a stark contrast between solemnity and shamelessness.

    I heard that in American libraries, some of Mark Twain's novels have suddenly "disappeared." Mark Twain once used his pen to sharply expose the wolf-like greed and money-worshiping of American monopoly capitalists – "Gold is their God. How to earn gold is their religion!" Their philosophy is "Two dollars is better than one dollar." The reason for the "disappearance" of Mark Twain's works lies here.

    I also heard that Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" was also one of the victims of McCarthyism, suffering the disaster of book burning. This is because the poet's war-drum-like verses, which attacked the corrupt capitalist system during his lifetime, still hit the Wall Street billionaires' vital points today:

    They are shouting and yelling about freedom in such a way,
    That the blood rushes to their faces,
    But they themselves do not hesitate to commit all crimes…
    In their eyes, the words in the Gospels are worth less than gold coins,
    Their love, hope – is to make more money…

    It should be said that da Vinci's painting does not offend capitalism, but they still have to tamper with it and distort it.

    I can't help but think of how Hollywood film companies distorted the great Polish patriotic composer Chopin into a petty martyr of love, shamefully dying under the pomegranate skirt of a beauty in the film "A Song to Remember."

    Their trampling on Chopin and da Vinci's paintings is no accident. They want to belittle the role of these cultural celebrities who are loved by the people.

    However, this kind of slanderous means will never damage the noble character of the art masters; on the contrary, it exposes the slanderers' own moral degradation, cultural decay, and corruption, and shows that they are destroyers of mankind's excellent cultural heritage.

    Who is solemn and who is shameless is very clear. (Geng Xin) (Attached picture)

    庄严和无耻
    美国资产阶级的宣传机器经常诬蔑共产党不尊重文化遗产，而把自己说成文化遗产的卫士。但是，谎言掩盖不了事实。不久以前，前美国驻苏联大使凯南在纽约一个集会上发表演说时，就承认：“世界上像我国这样不尊重艺术家、作家、作曲家或思想家的国家是很少的。”
    我手头有两张图片：一张是意大利著名画家达·芬奇画的少妇肖像画——“蒙娜丽莎”。艺术大师为我们塑造了一个美丽的、动人的、栩栩如生的妇女形象，给人以美的感觉。另一张是从1955年出版的“美国摄影年鉴”中选出来的，它把达·芬奇的原画完全歪曲了，面部和手都改成男人的。画面上是一幅狰狞的怪相。这样作践了一幅艺术作品还居然被称赞为“杰作”和“高度的特技”呢！
    如果把这两张图片放在一起，正是庄严和无耻的鲜明对照。
    听说在美国的图书馆里，一些马克·吐温的小说忽然“失踪”了。马克·吐温曾经用他的笔尖锐地揭露过美国垄断资本家的狼般的贪婪的拜金主义——“黄金，是他们的上帝。如何挣得黄金，就是他们的宗教！”他们的哲学是“两块钱比一块钱好。”马克·吐温的作品“失踪”，其原因就在这里。
    我还听说惠特曼的“草叶集”也是麦卡锡主义的牺牲品之一，受到焚书之灾。这是因为诗人生前抨击过腐朽的资本主义制度的战鼓般的诗句，直到今天，仍然打中了华尔街亿万富翁的要害：
    他们是这样地把自由呼号和叫喊，
    以致血液都冲上了脸，
    可是他们自己却不惜犯下一切罪行……
    在他们眼里，福音书上的话价值不如金元，
    他们的爱，希望——就是多弄钱……
    达·芬奇这幅画应该说是并没有冒犯资本主义的地方，可是他们也要来涂改它，歪曲它。
    我不禁联想起好莱坞电影公司在影片“一曲难忘”里，把波兰伟大的爱国作曲家萧邦如何歪曲成渺小的殉情者，可耻地死于美女的石榴裙下。
    他们糟踏萧邦和达·芬奇的画都是并非偶然的。他们要贬低这些受人民爱戴的文化名人的作用。
    然而，这种诽谤手段决无损于艺术大师们的崇高人格，反而暴露了诽谤者自己道德的堕落，文化的腐朽、糜烂，说明他们是人类优秀的文化遗产的摧残者。
    谁是庄严，谁是无耻，这是最分明不过的。　（耕新）（附图片）
