    An Appeal for Mao Mao

    To the Editorial Staff:

    With angry hearts, we are exposing to you a case of cruel child abuse.

    We are staff members of the People's Literature Publishing House, residing in dormitory number 5, Tizi Hutong, this city. For the past three years, we have frequently heard a child's cries and screams; we have also seen him locked in the room, clinging to the window, looking outside. This child, who is being beaten and imprisoned, is not yet six years old and is named Mao Mao. His biological mother was a nanny who, due to difficult living conditions, gave him to Gu Xuejie, an editor at the People's Literature Publishing House, and his wife, Li Jing.

    Li Jing is a teacher at Beijing Municipal Fourth Middle School. She uses many vicious methods to abuse this adopted son. Last summer, Li Jing tortured the child continuously for more than three hours, hitting the bones on his hands, scraping his hips with a comb, and forcing him to kneel on a washboard. On one occasion, Li Jing punished the child in the courtyard by making him hold his arms high, then twisting his ears and forcing him to kneel. After Mao Mao knelt down, Li Jing used a wooden stick to beat the bones on the back of his hands indiscriminately.

    Having witnessed these situations, we were outraged and collectively signed a letter to the Municipal Fourth Middle School exposing Li Jing's criminal behavior; we also reported it to our publishing house leaders, pointing out Gu Xuejie's erroneous attitude of indulgence and even shielding these actions. After our publishing house leaders educated Gu Xuejie, Li Jing's abuse of her adopted son did not stop, but the methods became more covert. On February 6th of this year, the publishing house's nursery gave Mao Mao a bath and discovered a large purple bruise on his hips. After repeated inquiries, he revealed that his mother had hit him. Later, before Mao Mao's injuries had healed, Li Jing locked him up and did not send him to the nursery. One day, when the couple went to work, people in the same courtyard heard Mao Mao crying in the room, but the door was locked from the outside; looking through the window, they saw several blue marks on Mao Mao's face. On May 13th, Li Jing again shouted and slapped Mao Mao seven or eight times. Subsequently, she pushed the child into the alley, forbidding him from entering the house. Under Li Jing's cruel torture, Mao Mao, at such a young age, already appears mentally abnormal.

    Last year, we exposed Li Jing's criminal behavior of child abuse to the Fourth Middle School, but it did not attract the school's attention, and they did not take appropriate action in a timely manner. Two months ago, we again reported Li Jing's new crimes to the Fourth Middle School's organization. The Fourth Middle School's Party branch also sent people to investigate, but still, no appropriate measures have been taken, so that recently, late one night, we again heard Mao Mao's suffocated cries. Obviously, Li Jing's criminal behavior of harming children continues.

    Mao Mao is a smart and lovable child. For the sake of this child's fate, we request exposure in the newspaper and hope that relevant departments will handle this matter promptly.

### 为毛毛呼吁

    为毛毛呼吁编辑同志：
    我们以愤怒的心情，向你们揭发一件残酷虐待儿童的事情。
    我们是人民文学出版社的工作人员，住本市梯子胡同五号宿舍。三年来，我们经常听到一个孩子的哭声、惨叫；还看见他被锁在屋子里，一个人扒着窗口朝外望。这个被毒打、被囚禁的孩子还不满六岁，名叫毛毛。他亲生母亲是个保姆，因为生活困难，便将他送给了人民文学出版社编辑顾学颉和他的妻子黎靖。
    黎靖是北京市立第四中学的教员。她用许多毒辣手段虐待这个养子。去年夏天，黎靖持续地折磨孩子三点多钟，打孩子手上的骨节，拿梳子刮孩子的两胯，罚孩子跪洗衣服板。有一次，黎靖在院里罚孩子两臂高举，继而拧住他的耳朵叫他跪下。毛毛跪下了以后，黎靖又用木棍乱打孩子手背上的骨节。
    我们看见这些情况，气愤不过，曾集体签名向市立四中揭发黎靖的犯罪行为；并向我社领导上反映，指出顾学颉对这些情况放纵不管以至包庇的错误态度。经我社领导方面向顾学颉进行教育以后，黎靖对养子的虐待并没有停止，只是方法更隐蔽了。今年二月六日，我社托儿所给毛毛洗澡，发现他胯下紫了一大块。用各种方式再三询问，他才说出是他妈妈打的。后来毛毛伤痕未消，黎靖就把他锁起来，不送托儿所。一天，他们夫妇上班去了，同院的人听见毛毛在屋里哭，门却从外面反锁着；扒窗一看，毛毛脸上有好几条青印。五月十三日，黎靖又大喊大叫地连打了毛毛七八个嘴巴。随后，她把孩子推到胡同里，不许进家。在黎靖的残酷折磨下，毛毛这样小的年纪，已经显得精神不正常了。
    去年我们向第四中学揭发黎靖虐待儿童的犯罪行为，但是并没有引起学校的重视，他们更没有及时作出适当的处理。两个月以前，我们又将黎靖新的罪行，向四中组织上反映。四中党支部也派人来进行过调查，但至今仍然没有适当的措施，以致在最近一天深夜里，我们又听到了毛毛窒息般的哭声。显然，黎靖摧残儿童的犯罪行为一直还在继续着。
    毛毛是个又聪明又惹人爱的孩子，为了这个孩子的命运，我们要求在报纸上揭发，并且希望有关方面迅速处理。
