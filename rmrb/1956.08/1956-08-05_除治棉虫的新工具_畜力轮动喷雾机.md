    A New Tool for Eliminating Cotton Pests – Animal-Powered Wheeled Sprayer
    Zong Zhenhuan
    This year, a new type of agricultural machinery for spraying pesticides has appeared in cotton-growing areas such as Henan: the animal-powered wheeled sprayer, manufactured this year by the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory.

    This sprayer is modified after the Soviet OK-5 horse-drawn wheeled sprayer. The spraying equipment of the Soviet OK-5 sprayer sprays from top to bottom, which can be used to control pests on crops such as potatoes, but it is not suitable for controlling aphids in cotton fields; because aphids are on the back of cotton leaves, when using pesticides such as 1605 to control cotton aphids, the pesticide must be sprayed on the back of the leaves. This modification design work was carried out by the former Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute in 1954. The Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory referred to this design and successfully trial-produced it at the end of 1955, and began mass production at the beginning of this year.

    The six main components of this sprayer are the pump, pesticide tank, frame, wheel drive, spraying device, and toolbox. The sprayer is four meters long and weighs 260 kilograms, and can be pulled by large livestock such as mules, horses, and cattle. The pesticide tank has a capacity of 160 liters, and it can spray 100-150 mu per day working ten hours, with a spraying width of 3-3.6 meters each time.

    This sprayer uses the rotation of the wheels to drive the piston in the pump to compress the pesticide through the transmission of gears, cranks, and connecting rods, and then sprays the pesticide through the nozzles on the spray rod.

    More than a thousand of these sprayers have already left the factory this year, and the areas where they are being tested this year are Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia provinces and regions. The price per unit is more than 700 yuan.

    After trial use, agricultural cooperatives generally welcome this new pest control tool. One hundred and fifty units were shipped to Henan Province, and 141 units were sold by July 6th.

    After using this sprayer, seventeen agricultural cooperatives in Xinxiang and Tangyin counties summarized three major advantages:

    1. High efficiency, saving labor, and able to control pests in a timely manner when large-scale outbreaks occur. A single-tube sprayer requires three people per unit and can control 4-5 mu of cotton fields per day; a wheeled sprayer requires six people and two head of livestock per unit and can spray 100-120 mu of cotton fields per day. In order to rush to control cotton aphids, the Shunfu Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxiang County used the method of "machines do not rest, people do," controlling 300 mu in one day and half a night. According to general efficiency calculations, spraying 100 mu of cotton fields with a single-tube sprayer requires 60 man-days, which costs 120 yuan at two yuan per man-day; spraying 100 mu with a wheeled sprayer only requires six man-days and two livestock days, costing only about 20 yuan for wages and livestock usage fees.

    2. Sprays evenly and does not miss any plants. According to experiments by various cooperatives, when spraying pesticides on cotton fields with this sprayer, every cotton seedling can be covered with pesticide, so the insecticidal effect is good.

    3. It is much safer to spray highly toxic pesticides such as 1605 with this sprayer than with small sprayers.

    After using it, some agricultural cooperatives also put forward suggestions for improvement for the sprayer: they hope to reduce the pulling force so that it can be pulled by one livestock, in order to reduce trampling on cotton seedlings; the frame should be raised appropriately so that it can not only spray pesticides to control insects, but also spray phosphate fertilizer. The Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory is preparing to study and improve according to these opinions. (Attached picture)

    除治棉虫的新工具——畜力轮动喷雾机
    宗镇寰
    今年河南等地棉区出现了一种新的喷药杀虫的农业机械，这就是上海农业药械厂今年制造的畜力轮动喷雾机。
    这种喷雾机是仿照苏联OK—5型马拉轮动喷雾机改装的。苏联OK—5型喷雾机的喷雾设备是从上向下喷的，可以用它防治马铃薯等作物的害虫，但不适合防治棉田的蚜虫；因为蚜虫在棉花叶子背面，使用1605等药液防治棉花蚜虫的时候，必须把药液喷到叶子背面。这种改装设计工作是前西北农具研究所在1954年进行的，上海农业药械厂参考这种设计，在1955年底试制成功，今年年初开始成批生产。
    这种喷雾机的六组部件是唧筒、药水桶、车架、轮动、喷雾和工具箱。喷雾机全长四公尺、重二百六十公斤，可用骡、马、牛大牲畜牵引。药水桶容量160公升，每天工作十小时可喷药100—150市亩，每次喷药宽度3—3.6公尺。
    这种喷雾机利用车轮转动，通过齿轮、曲拐和连杆的传动，带动唧筒里的活塞压缩药液，然后通过喷杆上的喷头把药液喷出去。
    今年出厂的喷雾机已经有一千多部，今年试用的地区是河南、河北、山东、陕西、辽宁、新疆和内蒙等省区。每部的价格是七百多元。
    经过试用以后，农业社普遍欢迎这种新的除虫工具。河南省运到一百五十台，到七月六日就卖出一百四十一台。
    新乡、汤阴两县十七个农业社在使用这种喷雾机以后，总结出了三大优点：
    1、效率高，节省劳力，病虫害大面积发生的时候，能够及时防治。单管喷雾机，每台三个人，一天的防治面积是4—5亩棉田；轮动喷雾机，每台六个人、2头牲畜，一天可喷洒100—120亩棉田。新乡县顺福农庄为了抢治棉蚜，曾用歇人不歇机器的办法，一个白天半个晚上防治了三百亩。根据一般效率计算，使用单管喷雾机喷洒一百亩棉田，需要六十个人工，每工按二元计算，共需120元；使用轮动喷雾机喷洒一百亩仅要六个人工、二个畜工，只需工资和牲口使用费大约二十元。
    2、喷洒均匀不丢棵。根据各社试验，用这种喷雾机向棉田喷药，每株棉苗都能沾到药水，因此杀虫效果良好。
    3、用这种喷雾机喷洒1605等剧毒农药时，比使用小型喷雾器要安全得多。
    有些农业社在使用后，对喷雾机还提出了改进意见：希望减轻拉力，使它能用一个牲口拉，以减少踏毁棉苗；架子要适当提高，使它不仅能喷药治虫，并且能喷撒磷肥。上海农业药械厂准备根据这些意见研究改进。（附图片）
