Deep in the Coconut Grove
    -- Visiting a Coconut Production Cooperative on Hainan Island
    By Our Correspondent Huang Xiangqing

    From Qinglan Port on the east coast of Hainan Island, I boarded a sailboat, crossed the rippling bay, and landed on a peninsula submerged in coconut groves. Tall, green walls of coconut trees stretched endlessly into the distance. The sea breeze blew, and rows and rows of coconut trees rustled, blending with the sounds of the waves into a vast symphony.

    Here, one sees nothing but a green ocean of trees. By chance, I found a wooden sign on a tree, indicating that this was the Jianhua Mountain Coconut Production Cooperative in Bangtang Township, Wenchang County; however, walking around in the forest, I could not find a trace of a village. If I hadn't met a young girl by the pond, I would certainly have gotten lost.

    This girl was Huang Lanying, the township head. More than two thousand people live in this forest, with many brick and tile houses, as well as cattle sheds, pigsties, and chicken coops built with coconut tree trunks and leaves. There are primary schools and spacious sports grounds. The dense coconut groves surround and separate the homes here. One family and another, here and there, can hear sounds and respond to each other, but cannot see each other. On the winding paths, a team of girls carrying baskets full of green coconuts often suddenly appears; their colorful figures flash and then disappear behind the trees. I once wondered why it seemed that only women were working everywhere. Later I learned that this was originally a hometown of overseas Chinese; of the more than 1,400 people participating in labor in the cooperative, about 1,000 or more are women.

    These days are the season when coconuts begin to be harvested in large quantities. In the morning, when the coconut groves are transformed into a golden ocean under the rising sun, a bustling and joyful life begins deep within the groves. Walking on the shaded paths, a warning cry to stop startles people, followed by the "thump, thump" of huge coconuts falling from the sky. A young man with a bare, glistening back slides down from a tree, and in the blink of an eye, he is climbing up another straight tree, one or two dozen meters high, throwing down coconuts one by one, so quickly and nimbly.

    Cooperative Director Zeng introduced me to the management of coconut trees. He said that many tasks require climbing the trees, such as pest control, harvesting, and cutting off the coconut fiber growing on the trunks. However, not everyone who grows up in the coconut groves can climb trees; it requires agility, strength, and courage. Now, the cooperative has more than twenty people specifically responsible for climbing trees and working. Most of them are young, but they have already had eight to ten years of "tree age." In the past, they were hired to climb trees, and their reward for climbing one tree was one coconut. After the establishment of the cooperative, climbing ten trees is equivalent to two work points, and generally, one can climb forty to sixty trees a day. If there is a need for rush harvesting due to typhoons, one can climb up to one hundred and twenty times a day.

    When the coconuts are scattered all over the ground, the girls come to collect them, carrying load after load to the processing factory, and some are directly carried to the beach for packing and export.

    This cooperative was only established in March of this year. At that time, the socialist fervor surged on the east coast, the west coast, and even on the Wuzhi Mountains. Everywhere in the coconut groves, people were brewing [action]. Thus, the island's first coconut cooperative was established. Based on the characteristic of focusing on orchard management here, the cooperative implements complete socialist cooperativization for agriculture, handicrafts, fisheries, and other collectively-owned sideline occupations, while coconut trees retain the method of dividend distribution based on shares, and are also allowed to have private plots of trees. The entire cooperative has already taken over 80,000 coconut trees as shares. Although only a few months of unified management have passed, the more than 59,000 trees that have reached the fruiting age have all achieved harvests that are rarely seen in recent years. After counting, more than 380,000 coconuts can be harvested, an increase of 40% compared to the 270,000 last year.

    "The trees are still the same trees, why can production increase so much in just a few months?" At first, I was skeptical about this question.

    The director of the cooperative answered my question: "In the past, because there was little paddy field and the income from coconut trees was not much, many people relied on rope-making for a living. Sometimes they worked today and only had grain tomorrow, so they had no mood or energy to take care of the trees. As a result, there were fewer [coconuts], not enough to pay the wages of those who climbed the trees. Some trees fell and died, and the trunks were not cleared, so pests bred. How could this produce more coconuts?

    "After the establishment of the cooperative, it is possible to uniformly allocate labor, and allocate all the elderly and weak people with a part of the main labor force to carry out rope production. In more than three months, the income was more than 26,000 yuan; the 34 people in the fishing team have already earned more than 15,000 yuan, and the livelihood difficulties of the cooperative members have been resolved, and the hundreds of people in the forestry team can safely manage the coconut groves. Some people patrol to drive away rats, some climb trees to remove pests, some carry water to water the trees, and more people clear thorns and weeds, burn them under the trees, and become good fertilizer for the coconut trees. In this way, how can production not increase?"

    The director of the cooperative also told me that because the thorns in the forest have been cleared, it will be possible to increase the amount of land by 2,500 mu this year, which is planned to be used for interplanting various tropical crops and miscellaneous grains, as well as developing animal husbandry. What has already been interplanted includes castor beans, lemongrass, derris, and sweet potatoes, sorghum, etc., which are of high economic value, totaling several hundred mu. Pig pens, fish ponds, and chicken coops have also been built under the coconut trees, to increase income in many ways. The cooperative members saw that there was vacant land, and also heard about encouraging household sideline occupations, so they also built small pig pens and chicken coops near their houses.

    Here, the forest is filled with a rich coconut fragrance carried by the wind. Once, I followed the direction of the strongest fragrance and found the cooperative's oil processing factory. The cooperative members are busy peeling coconut husks, sawing coconut shells, shaving coconut meat, and other work, and then sending the finely chopped coconut meat to the oil mill for steaming, frying, and pressing oil. Coconuts are really valuable things. Coconut oil can not only be eaten and used to make margarine, but also can be used as raw materials for lubricating oil, candles, and soap; the coconut bran after oil extraction is a good feed and fertilizer.

    Some time ago, the coconut fiber that can be used to make carpets, etc., was sold to democratic countries, earning more than 2,000 yuan. Now, the state has also begun to purchase the activated carbon used for making gas masks and coconut shells for making tools, which can add a large amount of income. The cooperative members no longer cut coconut shells randomly to take coconut meat like they did in the past, but use saws to cut them neatly one by one. Those piles of coconut husks, after soaking and drying, become coconut coir for braiding ropes. No matter where you go, you can see two or three old women, sitting under the eaves, in the shade of trees, leisurely chatting while their hands keep braiding coir ropes. Every catty braided counts as two work points. Some cooperative members who lack labor, as long as their hands can move, can also do some work, and are no longer simply relying on the "Five Guarantees."

    The income of the cooperative members has increased. According to estimates, in addition to the original early-season agricultural products and the income from coconut trees taken as shares, each member can expect to receive more than eight jiao per workday. In the past few months, cash has been prepaid once or twice every month. More than 300 households of overseas Chinese dependents have written letters to Nanyang, reporting the good news of the harvest to their relatives.

    In the rural general store, I saw some of the living conditions of the cooperative members. There, in addition to non-staple foods, the showcases were full of various daily necessities, not much different from a department store in a small city. On the cloth rack, there were more than twenty kinds of floral fabrics alone. Two sewing machines hummed from morning to late at night. A salesperson complained, "The girls just complain that we have too few goods and too few patterns. Otherwise, our monthly turnover would be more than 3,000 yuan."

    When I boarded the sailboat again and returned to Qinglan Port, looking back across the bay at this vast and boundless coconut grove, I seemed to still hear the laughter from deep in the coconut grove.

    椰林深处
    ——访问海南岛上一个椰子生产合作社
    本报记者　黄向青
    从海南岛东海岸的清澜港坐上帆船，渡过碧波荡漾的海湾，在一个被椰林淹没了的半岛上登岸。高大的绿墙似的椰林，无限宽阔地延伸向远方。海风吹来，整排整排的椰树喧闹着，跟一阵阵的涛声，混成一片浩瀚的音响。
    这里除下绿色的树的海洋，什么也看不到。偶然在一棵树上找到一块木牌子，知道这里就是文昌县邦塘乡建华山椰子生产合作社；但是，在林子里走来转去，总看不见村庄的影子。要不是在池塘边遇上一位年青姑娘，我准定得迷路了。
    这位姑娘正是这个乡的乡长黄兰英。这林子里住着两千多人，有许多砖瓦盖的房屋，还有用椰树干叶搭起来的牛棚、猪栏和鸡舍。有小学和广阔的运动场。还有一千多亩稻田旱地。浓密的椰林把这里的人家包围、分隔开了。这一家和那一家，这里和那里，能够听到声响，互相呼应，却不能互相望见。在弯曲的小路上，常常突然出现一队挑着满筐满箩青绿椰果的姑娘，她们那花花绿绿的身影，一闪就又消失在林子后面。我曾经奇怪为什么到处干活的尽是妇女？后来才知道这里原是一个侨乡，在社里，一千四百多个参加劳动的人，约有一千以上是妇女。
    这些日子，正是椰子开始大收的季节。早晨，当椰林在初升的太阳照射下变成金色的海洋的时候，椰林深处喧腾而欢乐的生活就开始了。走在林荫小路上，警告止步的叱喝声，把人吓一跳，紧接着，就“扑达”“扑达”从天空扔下一个个硕大的椰果来。一个裸露着油乌闪亮的脊梁的年青小伙子，从树上溜下来，转眼间，他又攀沿上了另一棵笔直的一、二十公尺高的树上去，一个个的把椰果扔下来，是那样的迅速敏捷。
    社主任曾向我介绍过：在椰树的管理工作中，有许多工作是需要上树干的，例如除虫、收果以及割下树身上长出来的椰布等等。但是，并不是每一个生长在椰林里的人都能上树，这需要身体灵活、有气力、有胆量，现在，全社有二十多个人专门负责上树干活的。他们大都很年青，但是都已有了十年八年“树龄”了。过去，他们长年受人雇请上树，上一次树的报酬是一棵椰果。建社以后，上十次树算二分工，一般一天能上四十到六十次。如果遇到台风袭来需要抢收的时候，一天能上到一百二十次。
    当椰果扔得满地的时候，姑娘们就来收拾了，一担担地挑到加工厂去，有一部分直接挑到海滩去打包外运。
    这个社是今年三月间才成立的。那时候，东海岸、西海岸以至五指山上，社会主义的热潮汹涌着。椰林里，人们到处酝酿着。这样全岛第一个椰子合作社成立了。根据这里以果树经营为主的特点，社里的农业、手工业、渔业和其他公有副业都实行完全社会主义合作化，而椰树则保留入股分红的办法，而且还允许有自留树。全社已入股椰树八万多棵。虽然只经过几个月的统一经营，但是达到结果年龄的五万九千多棵树，都获得了近年来少有的丰收。经过点数，可收椰子三十八万多个，比去年的二十七万个增加了40％。
    “树还是那些树，为什么几个月就能增产这么多呢？”开始我对这问题是怀疑的。
    社主任给我解答了这个疑问：“过去人们因为稻田少，椰树收入也不多，不少人都靠打绳为生，有时今天做了，明天才有粮，那还有心情和余力去侍弄林木。结果少的，还不够给上树的工钱。有些树倒了死了，树干不清理，虫害就滋生，这样怎能多结果呢。
    “建社以后，能够统一调配劳动力，把所有年老力弱的人，配上一部分主要劳动力，进行编绞绳缆生产，三个多月就收入二万六千多元；捕鱼队34人，已收入了一万五千多元，社员的生活困难得到了解决，林业队的几百人就安心管理椰林了。有人巡逻赶鼠，有人上树除虫，有人挑水淋树，更多的人清理荆棘野草，在树下烧了，又成为椰树的好肥料，这样，怎能不增产呢。”
    社主任还告诉我，因为清理了林间的荆棘，今年就可能增加二千五百亩土地，计划用来间种各种热带作物和杂粮以及发展养畜业。现在已经间种的，就有经济价值很高的蓖麻、香茅、毒鱼藤以及甘薯、高粱等共几百亩；在椰树下还修建了猪圈、渔塘、鸡舍，多方面增加收入。社员们看见有了空地，又听说鼓励家庭副业，也纷纷在房屋附近搭架小型的猪圈、鸡舍。
    这里，林子里到处随风散着浓郁的椰香，有一次，我顺着香气最浓的方向走去，找到了社里的榨油加工厂。社员们正忙碌地剥椰衣、锯椰壳、刨椰肉等工作，然后把刨成细碎的椰肉送到油坊去蒸炒，打油。椰子真是宝贵的东西，椰油不但可以食用和制造人造牛油，还可作滑机油、蜡烛、肥皂的原料；榨油以后的椰麸，是很好的饲料和肥料。
    前些时候，可制地毡等的椰布外销民主国家，就收入了二千多元；现在，国家对可以制防毒面具用的活性炭和作用具的椰壳也开始进行收购，又可增加一笔很大的收入。社员们现在已经不再像过去那样乱砍椰壳取椰肉，而是用锯来一个个切得整整齐齐的了。那一堆堆的椰衣，经过浸晒，就成为编绞绳缆的椰鬃。无论到那里，都看见三三两两的老妇人，坐在屋檐下、树荫里，一面悠闲地谈心，一面两手不停的编鬃绳。每编一斤，算二分工，有些缺少劳力的社员，只要手能动，也可以作些活，不单纯依靠“五保”了。
    社员的收入增加了。据估算，每户社员除了原来的早造农产品，以及入股的椰树收入外，每个劳动日估计还可得到八角以上的报酬。几个月来，每月都预支过一两次现款。三百多户侨眷已经纷纷写信到南洋，向亲人们报告丰收喜讯。
    在乡村综合商店里，我看到了社员的部分生活情况。在那里，除了副食品以外，满橱窗各式各样的日用品，并不比一个小城市的百货店差些。在布架上，单是花布就有二十多种，两部缝衣机，??地从早晨一直响到深夜。一个售货员还抱怨说：“姑娘们光嫌我们货少，花样少，不然，我们一个月的营业额不止这三千多元。”
    当我又坐上帆船回到清澜港，隔着海湾回头凝望这漫漫无际的椰林的时候，仿佛还听见椰林深处的欢笑声。
