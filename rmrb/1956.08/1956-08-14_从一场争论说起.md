    Starting from a Debate
    Long Woliu
    Not long ago, the Xian Shui (Salty Water) District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Quanxian County, Guangxi Province, organized a very interesting debate among rural party members. The topic of the debate was a question of universal significance in current rural life – how to treat the household sideline production of agricultural cooperative members. During the debate, some people believed that if cooperative members were allowed to engage in household sideline production, the expansion of private wealth would affect the consolidation of the cooperative, and even cause the agricultural cooperative to collapse. Therefore, they advocated restricting or even eliminating the household sideline production of cooperative members. Some people opposed this view, and used practical examples to prove that allowing and helping cooperative members to engage in household sideline production did not hinder the consolidation of the cooperative. It could help cooperative members solve some of their living difficulties, and their enthusiasm for labor in the cooperative would be higher than before, and they would be more supportive of socialism. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that cooperative members should be allowed to engage in household sideline production.
    This was a very interesting debate.
    Why exactly did some people advocate restricting the household sideline production of cooperative members? Materials from Guangxi and other places tell us that this is because many cadres who lead agricultural cooperative work have a great concern – they worry that cooperative members will generate capitalism after developing household sideline production. Therefore, they are always highly vigilant against cooperative members, and accuse those who engage in household sideline production of being "spontaneous," "wanting to take the capitalist road," and "taking the rich peasant line," and so on. They do not understand that after the socialist transformation of urban and rural areas has achieved a decisive victory, especially in fully cooperative areas, capitalist exploitation has lost its position and foundation, and the question of the two roads of socialism and capitalism has been basically resolved. Under these circumstances, general scattered household sideline production does not have the conditions to generate capitalism. It can be seen that restricting cooperative members from engaging in scattered household sideline production is unreasonable. However, this does not mean that it is not necessary to educate cooperative members to care about the development of the collective economy, to put the main effort into developing the collective economy, and to regard scattered household sideline production as an auxiliary production, using spare time to carry it out. Only in this way will it be beneficial to both the cooperative and the cooperative members personally.
    Some incorrect understanding of the relationship between the collective and the individual in agricultural cooperatives is also an important reason for restricting household sideline production.
    In agricultural cooperatives, the collective interests of the entire cooperative and the individual interests of the cooperative members are fundamentally consistent; however, there are also some contradictions between them. The same is true between the production of the entire cooperative and the sideline production of the cooperative members. There are indeed some contradictions in the arrangement of cooperative members' working hours inside and outside the cooperative, the use of cooperative members' funds inside and outside the cooperative, and the division of the scope of sideline production operated by the cooperative and the cooperative members. If handled improperly, this contradiction will cause losses to the cooperative or the cooperative members. In the past, in some agricultural cooperatives, some cooperative members only cared about their own household sideline production, did not actively participate in the cooperative's production, and even left the cooperative's work unattended during the busy farming season to do their own private affairs, which caused losses to the cooperative's production. This should of course be taken as a warning. However, this contradiction is not an insurmountable contradiction. As long as some reasonable systems are formulated according to the principle of "benefit to both public and private," and cooperative members are educated to abide by and implement these systems, the cooperative's production and the cooperative members' household sideline production can complement each other. Some people, however, absolutize this contradiction. They believe that since they are taking the socialist road, they should emphasize unity and concentration everywhere. In addition to the cooperative's production, cooperative members should not engage in personal economic activities in their spare time. Since they have joined the cooperative, they should pay attention to "collectivism," and cooperative members no longer need any freely disposable labor time. Since the collective ownership system is implemented, then the cooperative members' funds should all be invested in the cooperative. In short, they believe that since it is necessary to pay attention to collective interests, it is not necessary or even impossible to take care of the individual interests of cooperative members. Under this reason, the household sideline production and even the daily life of cooperative members are often subjected to excessive interference.
    The shortcomings in the propaganda work in some areas in the past have also contributed to the incorrect understanding in this regard. In the past, some places only emphasized carrying out collectivism and love-for-the-cooperative education among farmers, but neglected to carry out education on caring for cooperative members among rural cadres. Some places have universally carried out "discussions on the two ideologies of collectivism and individualism," and as a result, due to improper selection of typical examples, some personal interests that should have been cared for were obliterated. These have had some bad influences.
    Maintaining and developing collective interests while taking care of the individual interests of cooperative members is a fundamental principle for handling the relationship between the cooperative and the cooperative members, and it is also an important key to whether the agricultural cooperative can be consolidated. Rural cadres should understand that after farmers hand over their means of production to the cooperative, the agricultural cooperative becomes their main reliance and hope, which makes it even more necessary than ever to actively take care of and care for their lives; otherwise, it is easy to cause their disappointment and dissatisfaction. Of course, while emphasizing caring for the interests of cooperative members, we must never disregard the interests of the collective, so we should also educate cooperative members to cherish and respect collective interests, and make them understand that only on the basis of the development of collective interests can individual interests be reliably guaranteed. At any time, neglecting one aspect is not good. This raises a question, how exactly can we both maintain the collective and take care of the individual? How to grasp this measure? I believe that by adding up the income distributed by the cooperative to the cooperative members and the household sideline income of the cooperative members, and under normal conditions, increasing the income of more than 90% of the cooperative members, and striving to ensure that the remaining cooperative members do not reduce their income, is precisely the standard for handling the relationship between collective interests and individual interests at present. Reaching this standard correctly solves a basic aspect of the current relationship between collective interests and individual interests. Of course, there are other aspects, such as how to ensure the cooperative's need for labor while giving cooperative members freely disposable time, and so on. How to handle these problems best, there is no immutable specific method, but it needs to be determined according to the conditions at that time and place. As long as democracy is fully developed and discussed with cooperative members more, it will surely be handled appropriately.
    Some agricultural cooperative cadres have not been able to correctly handle the household sideline production problems of cooperative members and the relationship between the collective and the individual, and have even made some mistakes, which should of course be corrected. However, they should not be blamed excessively. An agricultural cooperative, including hundreds or even thousands of cooperative members who were small producers yesterday, has thousands or tens of thousands of mu of land, and it is very difficult to take care of the different requirements and interests of so many people and to take care of all kinds of collective and individual production of the entire cooperative. Many of the cadres in agricultural cooperatives only had the experience of managing a single household or a small family business not long ago, but today they have to manage a large family business, and it is difficult to imagine that there will be no shortcomings and errors. We should also see that when some cadres make mistakes, such as neglecting the individual interests of cooperative members, they are often very unconscious; on the contrary, they sincerely think: "Isn't what I am doing for everyone?" They believe that only in this way can the agricultural cooperative be run well and everyone can benefit. Therefore, we should not simply criticize these comrades, but should enthusiastically help them - help them improve their ideological level and working ability, and help them learn how to correctly lead agricultural production cooperatives.

    从一场争论说起
    龙卧流
    不久以前，中共广西全县咸水区委曾经组织农村党员进行了一场很有意思的争论。争论的题目是当前农村生活中有普遍意义的一个问题——怎样对待农业社社员的家庭副业生产。在争论中，有的人认为：如果让社员经营家庭副业，私有财富一旦扩大起来，就会影响社的巩固，甚至会使农业社垮台。因此，他们主张限制以至取消社员的家庭副业。有些人反对这种说法，他们以实际的例子证明：允许和帮助社员经营家庭副业并不妨碍社的巩固；这样可以帮助社员解决一些生活困难问题，社员在社里的劳动积极性会比以前更加高涨，也更加拥护社会主义。最后，大家一致同意：应该允许社员经营家庭副业生产。
    这是一场很有意思的争论。
    究竟为什么有些人主张对社员的家庭副业进行限制呢？广西和别的地方的材料告诉我们，这是因为许多领导农业社工作的干部有一个很大的顾虑——担心社员发展家庭副业后会产生资本主义。因此，他们对社员总是严加戒备，并且指责那些搞家庭副业的社员是“自发”、“想走资本主义道路”、“走富农路线”等等。他们不了解：在城乡社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利以后，特别是在完全合作化了的地区，资本主义剥削已经丧失了它的阵地和基础，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的问题已经基本上解决了；在这种情况下，一般的零星的家庭副业，是没有条件产生资本主义的。由此可见，限制社员经营零星家庭副业是没有道理的。但是这里并不是说不需要教育社员关心集体经济的发展，把主要力量放在发展集体经济方面，把零星家庭副业作为一种辅助性的生产，利用空闲时间去进行。只有这样，对社和社员个人才都是有利的。
    有些人在对待农业社的集体和个人关系上有一些不正确认识，也是限制家庭副业生产的重要原因之一。
    在农业社里，全社的集体利益和社员的个人利益，从根本上说是一致的；但是它们之间也有某些矛盾。在全社的生产和社员的副业生产两者之间也是如此。社员在社内外的劳动时间的安排、社员的资金在社内外的使用以及社与社员经营的副业范围的划分等方面，就的确有某些矛盾；如果处理不当，这种矛盾就会给社或社员造成损失。过去在有些农业社里，由于某些社员只关心自己的家庭副业，不积极参加社的生产，甚至在农忙的时候丢下社里的活不干而去做自己的私事，就曾经使社的生产蒙受损失。这当然是应该引以为戒的。但是，这种矛盾并不是不可克服的矛盾。只要根据“公私两利”的原则，制定一些合理的制度，并且教育社员遵守执行这些制度，社的生产与社员的家庭副业，就可以做到相辅相成。有些人却把这种矛盾绝对化了，他们认为：既然走社会主义道路，那就应该处处强调统一、集中，除了社的生产以外，社员就不应该利用空闲时间从事个人的经济活动；既然入了社，那就应该讲究“集体”，社员就不必再有什么自由支配的劳动时间；既然实行集体所有制，那末社员的资金就应该全部投到社里；……。总之，他们认为：既然要讲究集体利益，那就不必要甚至不可能照顾社员的个人利益了。就在这种理由之下，社员的家庭副业以至日常生活都常常受到过分的干涉。
    过去一些地区宣传工作上的缺点，也助长了在这方面的不正确的认识。过去有的地方只强调了对农民进行集体主义、爱社教育，却忽视了对农村干部进行关心社员的教育；有的地方普遍开展过“集体主义与个人主义两种思想的讨论”，结果往往由于典型选择不当，一些应该关怀的个人利益都被抹煞。这些，都起了一些不好的影响。
    维护和发展集体利益，同时照顾社员的个人利益，是处理社与社员关系的一条根本原则，也是农业社能否巩固的一个重要关键。应该使农村干部了解，农民把生产资料交到社里以后，农业社就成了他们主要的依靠和指望，这就比以前任何时候都更需要主动地去照顾和关怀他们的生活；否则，就很容易招致他们的失望和不满。当然，在强调关怀社员利益的时候，我们也决不能不顾集体的利益，因此也应教育社员爱护和尊重集体利益，使他们了解只有在集体利益得到发展的基础上，个人的利益才有可靠的保证。任何时候，偏废某一方面都是不好的。这里就产生了一个问题，究竟怎样做才算是既维护了集体，又照顾了个人呢？如何掌握这个分寸呢？我认为：把社里分配给社员的收入和社员家庭副业收入加起来计算，在年景正常的条件下，使90％以上的社员增加收入，争取其余的社员也不减少收入，就正是当前处理集体利益与个人利益关系问题的标准。达到了这个标准，就正确解决了当前集体利益与个人利益关系的一个基本方面。当然还有其他的方面，例如怎样才能既保证社里对劳动力的需要，又有给社员自由支配的时间等等。这些问题怎样处理最好，没有一成不变的具体办法，而需要按照当时当地的条件决定。只要充分发扬民主，多多同社员商量，就一定能处理得恰到好处。
    一些农业社的干部没有能够正确处理社员的家庭副业问题，集体与个人的关系问题，甚至犯了一些错误，这当然是应该纠正的。但是，却不应该过分责备他们。一个农业社，包括几百个以至几千个昨天还是小生产者的社员，有上千上万亩的土地，要照顾到那么多人的不同的要求和利益，要把全社集体的、个人的各种生产都照顾到，有很大的困难。农业社干部中的许多人不久以前还只有管理一家一业或小家小业的经验，今天却要管理大家大业，要一点缺点和错误也不发生，是很难设想的。我们还应该看到，当某些干部发生错误比如忽视社员个人利益的时候，常常是很不自觉的；相反地，他们是真诚地想着：“难道我这样作还不是为了大家吗？”他们认为只有这样才能办好农业社，才能使大家得到好处。因此，对待这些同志，不应该单纯指责，而应该热情帮助——帮助他们提高思想水平和工作能力，帮助他们学会正确地领导农业生产合作社。
