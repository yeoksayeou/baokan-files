    That "Sunday Seven"
    Gancao
    There were no classes today, so I know it's "Sunday Seven." I checked the newspaper to find out what the date is.
    I spent the whole morning doing "long sentence analysis" exercises. This stuff is really annoying; sometimes it takes more than forty minutes to analyze a single sentence clearly. As soon as I finished this exercise, I moved on to Russian exercises. I had barely started when it was time for lunch. At 1:30 PM, there was a general branch committee meeting, so I couldn't take a nap. I continued doing exercises, but I still had four unfinished when it was time for the meeting.
    The general branch committee meeting ended at 3:30 PM. As soon as I got back to the dormitory, a class meeting started. Right after the class meeting, the branch secretary said, "Members stay behind," and another branch meeting started. Actually, the branch meeting wasn't much different from the class meeting, but it particularly emphasized "the leading role that members should play."
    During dinner, several people said, "Ugh, I'd rather have classes every day and never experience this unlucky Sunday again." I really hope to change all the "Sundays" on the calendar to "Sunday Seven," but I don't know which department to suggest it to.
    I've wanted to take half a day off to stroll around the city park for a long time, but I've been too busy to make it happen. After dinner, I finally had some free time and took a walk around the school garden for a short time, only twenty minutes. When I got back, it was almost time for self-study, so I got out my washbasin to wash my face. When I took out the washbasin, I realized that my clothes, unwashed for three days, were still in it! I'll have to save them for washing during my lunch break tomorrow.
    During evening self-study, I continued to do Russian exercises, and I kept dozing off. Applying "cooling oil" didn't help. As I drowsily went to bed, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't done the outline for Monday's class discussion yet.
    Lying in bed, I was still thinking: why is daytime on Earth so short? It would be great if each day could be extended to thirty-six hours instead of twenty-four.

### “星期七”那天

专栏：我怎样度过一个星期日？

    “星期七”那天
    甘草
    今天没有课，所以知道是星期“七”。查了报纸，才知道是几号。
    一个上午都在做“长句分析”的练习。这东西真缠人，有时一个句子要四十多分钟才分析清楚。这个练习一完，接着我又做俄文练习，才做一点，就该吃中饭了，下午一点半钟要开团总支委员会议，午觉是睡不成了，我又接着做练习，可是临开会前还有四条没做完哩。
    三点半结束总支委员会议，一回宿舍，马上又开班会。班会刚开完，支部书记叫“团员留下”，又开支部会。其实支部会和班会并没有什么不同，不过特别强调了一下“应该发挥团员的带头作用”而已。
    吃晚饭的时候，好几个人说：“咳，我真情愿天天上课，一辈子不想过这倒霉的星期日。”我也真希望能把日历上的“星期日”都改为“星期七”，不过我不知道该向那一个部门建议。
    我早就想发狠抽半天空去逛逛市公园，然而老忙来忙去，一直不能如愿。晚饭后总算闲点了，上校花园蹓躂了一圈，时间不长，只有二十分钟。回来后已快上自习了，于是端出脸盆来洗洗脸，拿出脸盆，才发现三天没洗的衣服还搁在脸盆里！只好留着明天午睡时间洗了。
    晚自习继续做俄文练习，老要打盹，擦上“清凉油”也没有用。当我迷迷糊糊上床睡时，才突然想起星期一课堂讨论的提纲还没有做呢。
    躺在床上还在想：为什么地球上的白天这么短呢？每天要能延长到三十六小时而不是二十四小时，那就好了。
