    People Without Manners
    One evening, on a public bus, a young couple sat diagonally across from me. They were beaming and chatting intimately. When getting off the bus, the man said to his female companion, "Be careful, darling, it's difficult to walk here...." At that moment, he pushed aside an old woman standing by the door and rudely shouted, "Where are you squeezing to! Are you blind, didn't you see people are getting off!"
    In Xi'an and Baoji, I have seen similar situations several times. These people do not offer seats to the elderly and children, are impolite, and even rudely bully the elderly.　Zhang Zixin

    没有礼貌的人
    一天晚上，在公共汽车里，有一对青年男女坐在我的斜对面。他们眉开眼笑，谈得很亲热。在下车的时候，男的对他的女伴说：“当心点，亲爱的，这里很难走……。”就在这个时候，他用手推开了站在门旁的一位老大娘，并且蛮横地叫道：“你往哪里钻啊！眼睛瞎啦，没有看见人家要下车吗！”
    在西安和宝鸡市，我曾数次看到类似这样的情况。这些人对老人和小孩不让座位，不讲礼貌，甚至无礼地欺侮老人。　张自新
