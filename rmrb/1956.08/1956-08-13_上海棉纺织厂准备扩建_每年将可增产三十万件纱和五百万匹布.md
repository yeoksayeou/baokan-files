Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Gao Jie): Fifteen joint state-private Shanghai cotton textile factories are preparing to utilize idle factory buildings from the private ownership period to install over 150,000 spindles of spinning machines and over 1,400 looms.

On the 10th, Zhang Chengzong, Director of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, stated at the fourth session of the First Shanghai Municipal People's Congress: By fully utilizing the existing idle factory buildings of state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in the city, Shanghai can add 220,000 cotton spindles. The required investment is only half the total investment of building a new cotton mill with 220,000 spindles, and it can be recovered from profits in less than a year.

A planning group specifically formed by the East China Textile Administration Bureau for this expansion work has been working for two months. They carefully investigated the factory buildings, production conditions, and technical strengths of 69 cotton textile factories in the city. With reference to the expansion plans submitted by each factory, it was initially determined that in addition to increasing spindles, 120,000 thread spindles and nearly 3,000 looms could also be added, and the expansion could be completed in approximately four years. Coupled with necessary technical improvements and increased production efficiency, the city will be able to increase its annual production by 300,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 5 million bolts of cotton cloth.

The head of the planning group said: While designing the expansion, the relevant departments also considered that Shanghai has the conditions to fully increase the production of high-grade cotton fabrics to meet new market needs. The state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory will first increase wide looms next year to specialize in the production of wide fine cloth, which is very popular in foreign markets. The joint state-private Huayang Textile Factory No. 2, which is experienced in producing jacquard fabric, is preparing to adjust its existing equipment and expand into a factory specializing in the production of jacquard fabric. The production of popular high-grade khaki, fine poplin, and transverse sateen will also be greatly increased after the expansion.

The production volume of Shanghai's cotton textile industry in the first half of this year has already exceeded the highest level in the same period in history. In the first half of this year, more than 10,000 idle spindles in joint state-private cotton textile factories have also been fully put into operation, and shifts have been added, with output increasing by about 30% compared with the same period last year. At present, some equipment is still being installed. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory is also installing combing equipment, which, after being put into production in the fourth quarter, can increase the monthly production of 5,000 bolts of 80-count and 100-count high-grade poplin.

    上海棉纺织厂准备扩建
    每年将可增产三十万件纱和五百万匹布
    新华社上海11日电　新华社记者高洁报道：上海有十五个公私合营棉纺织厂准备利用私营时期空余的厂房，安装十五万多枚纱锭的纺纱机和一千四百多台织布机。
    十日，华东纺织管理局局长张承宗在上海市第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上发言说：把全市国营和公私合营棉纺织厂现有的空余厂房都加以充分利用，上海就可以增加棉纺纱锭二十二万枚，所需的投资只占新建一个二十二万纱锭的棉纺厂投资总额的半数，而且不到一年就可以从利润中收回。
    华东纺织管理局一个专门为这项扩建工作组成的规划小组，已经工作了两个月。他们仔细调查全市六十九个棉纺织厂的厂房、生产条件和技术力量，参照各厂提出的扩建计划，初步确定除了增加纱锭以外，还可以增加十二万枚线锭和近三千台织机，大约四年时间就可以扩建完成。再加上必要的技术改造，提高生产效率，全市每年将可以增产三十万件棉纱和五百万匹棉布。
    规划小组的负责人说：在设计扩建的同时，主管部门也考虑到上海有条件充分增产高级棉织品，来满足市场的新需要。国营上海第十九棉纺织厂明年首先要增加宽幅织机，专生产在国外市场上很受欢迎的宽细布。生产提花布富有经验的公私合营华阳纺织二厂准备调整现有设备，扩建成一个专门生产提花布的工厂。对人们喜爱的高级卡其、细府绸、横贡缎等，扩建以后也要大大增产。
    上海棉纺织工业今年上半年的生产量，已经超过历史上同期的最高水平。今年上半年，公私合营棉纺织厂一万多锭闲置纱锭也已经全部开动，还增加了班次，产量比去年同期增加30％左右。目前，还有一部分设备在安装。国营上海第二棉纺织厂现在也正在添装精梳设备，第四季度投入生产以后，每月可以增产五千匹八十支和一百支的高级府绸。
