Shanghai commercial personnel, known for their rich experience and excellent service, are aging year by year, but there is no source for young successors. Recently, as emerging cities and industrial and mining areas across the country have requested Shanghai to support more skilled commercial personnel, the heads of many industries have felt this looming threat.

According to surveys, of the 928 employees left at the Yong'an Company, which had been in operation for 38 years, when it became a joint state-private enterprise, only 36 were under 28 years old, while 95 were over 58 years old. Since the joint venture, 35 people have successively applied for retirement. In the Huangpu District silk and cloth store, out of 791 employees, 404 were over 40 years old, accounting for more than half, while young workers under 25 years old accounted for only 7%. In these industries, there are almost no development targets for the Communist Youth League. In the Western-style clothing and fashion industries, which have very high tailoring skills, the number of Grade A technicians is only about 300, and their ages are all over 40; although there are more Grade B technicians, most of them are also over 35 years old. In industries closely related to residents' lives, such as hairdressing, restaurants, Western medicine, Chinese medicine, tea snacks, and southern goods, there is also an inevitable trend of aging and a lack of successors.

People familiar with the commercial situation reflect that in the past seven years, only state-owned stores have transferred in some young commercial personnel. General private stores, due to market reorganization and operating difficulties, have not only completely stopped recruiting apprentices and trainees, but have also allowed a large number of young employees to leave commercial work. In almost every political movement, many young activists from stores were transferred to engage in mass work and political power work. The situation in which young employees are unwilling to engage in commercial work and are transferring to other jobs in large numbers has continued to develop. Since April of this year, several thousand young commercial personnel aged 18 to 26 have gone to industrial technical schools to study or have been directly absorbed by factories, including clothing store technicians and skilled barbers with six or seven years of experience. Of the 5,000 commercial personnel transferred to emerging industrial and mining cities this year, most are also young and middle-aged employees. Famous stores that moved to Beijing, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and other places left some old, infirm, and sick personnel in Shanghai, and only went out after supplementing some young and strong skilled employees from other stores. According to the requirements of various places, approximately tens of thousands of skilled commercial personnel will still need to be transferred out in the next few years. The trend of more and more elderly people and fewer and fewer young people among Shanghai commercial personnel seems to be developing further.

Some company managers, store directors, and individual elderly employees that the reporter contacted all believe that cultivating a commercial person with skills and experience is not as simple as people imagine. A clothing technician has to try cutting for several years after completing his apprenticeship before he can do custom tailoring; even a salesperson has to practice for half a year to be able to use the abacus quickly. Therefore, they believe that it is necessary to start cultivating successors now. There are still more than 400,000 commercial personnel in Shanghai, but peddlers and general simple commercial workers account for the majority, and some are personnel serving national consumers and engaged in foreign trade. This year, due to the sudden increase in consumer purchasing power, retail stores closely related to people's lives have felt a shortage of manpower. In the future, the large-scale external transfer of young and strong skilled commercial personnel and the continuous retirement of the elderly and infirm will intensify the phenomenon of commercial personnel disconnection, and the service level of the entire commercial sector will also be greatly reduced as a result.

Currently, relevant departments are considering taking measures to supplement personnel. Some industries have already begun to absorb surplus personnel from those industries that are about to be eliminated; some are preparing to bring back unemployed former commercial workers from society; and some are planning to absorb employees' family members. However, most opinions believe that the most fundamental and long-term solution is to resume recruiting apprentices and trainees or to conduct training by opening commercial technical schools. Among the current commercial vocational schools in Shanghai, there are only cultural schools, political schools, and accounting and statistics schools, but no specialized commercial technical schools.

Now some people also suspect: Can the resumption of recruiting apprentices and opening schools guarantee the source of commercial personnel? Because the social prejudice against commercial work still exists. Since the sources of university students, industrial vocational students, and factory apprentices are insufficient, not many people will choose commerce as a career. Some people believe that the "idea of ​​undervaluing commerce" is not only a traditional concept, but also a real problem. To date, the special contributions and rich experience in labor of commercial personnel have not been correctly valued and universally respected by social opinion. Many commercial technicians, such as senior chefs, tailors, photographers, pastry technicians, and barbers, have special creations, almost like experts. Even salespeople in general stores have a lot of special service experience. The reporter once visited an old employee in the Xie Da Xiang silk and cloth store. He not only had rich commodity knowledge and skilled measuring, calculating, and cutting experience, but was also good at understanding customer psychology. As soon as customers entered the door, he could know their personality and preferences from their expressions, words, and clothing, and correctly help customers choose suitable fabrics. Although he has been transferred to another store, some old customers from more than 20 years ago still have to find him to cut fabrics. In industries such as department stores, woolen fabrics, stationery, shoes and hats, there are some old salespeople who, by touching or looking at the goods they handle, can know their origin, quality, and performance. Unfortunately, these commercial personnel with special skills and experience are rarely introduced in newspapers and magazines; the pens of writers have also hardly touched on these outstanding people who work diligently year after year; the experience of many of them has not been summarized and has not been well disseminated and promoted. The honors received by these excellent commercial personnel cannot be compared with those in other industries. There are hundreds of thousands of salespeople in Shanghai, but only two photos of salespeople have appeared on the "Hall of Glory" next to the People's Park in the city center, which publicizes the deeds of model workers. In terms of wage treatment, there is still a phenomenon of excessive suppression of some commercial personnel with special experience. According to a survey of a large store with more than 50 employees, the wage treatment between the most experienced old salesperson and the most unskilled salesperson used to differ by as much as three times, but now the distance has been reduced to less than one time. This tendency of egalitarianism in wage treatment is obviously not conducive to the improvement and development of commercial work.

    上海商业人员担心没有接班人
    新华社记者　张家炽
    以经验丰富、服务优良著称的上海商业人员，平均年龄一年比一年老了，但年轻的后继者却没有来源。最近因为各地新兴城市和工矿区要求上海支援更多的熟练的商业人员，不少行业的主管人员已经感觉到这种隐约的威胁。
    据调查，经营了三十八年的永安公司，实行公私合营的时候留下的九百二十八个职工中，二十八岁以下的只有三十六人，而五十八岁以上的有九十五人，合营以后已有三十五人陆续申请退休了。黄浦区绸布商店七百九十一个职工中，四十岁以上的有四百零四人，占一半以上，二十五岁以下的青工只占7％。这些行业中，青年团的发展对象也几乎没有了。具有很高的裁制技术水平的西服、时装业中，甲级技工人数只剩下三百人左右，年龄已都在四十岁以上；乙级技工人数虽然比较多些，但年龄也大多在三十五岁以上了。在理发、酒菜、西药、国药、茶食、南货等与居民生活有密切关系的行业中，也无例外地有年龄增长后继无人的趋势。
    熟悉商业情况的人士反映，最近七年来，只有国营商店调进过一些年轻的商业人员，一般私营商店因为市场改组，经营困难，不仅完全停止招收学徒和练习生，而且让大批青年职工离开了商业工作。几乎每一次政治运动中，都有许多商店的青年积极分子被抽调去从事群众工作和政权工作。几年来青年职工不愿从事商业工作而大量转业的状况，到目前也还在发展中。今年四月份以来，十八岁到二十六岁的青年商业人员到工业技工学校学习和直接被工厂吸收的就有好几千人，其中甚至有六、七年工龄的服装店技工和熟练的理发师。今年以来，输送到新兴工矿城市的五千个商业人员中，大多也是青壮年职工。迁往北京、兰州、西安等地的著名商店，都留下了一部分年老力衰和有病的人员在上海，而从其他商店中补充了一些年轻力壮的熟练职工才出去的。根据各地的要求，今后几年内，大约还需要输送出熟练的商业人员几万人。上海商业人员中老年人愈来愈多，青年人愈来愈少的趋势，看来还将发展下去。
    记者接触到的一部分公司经理、商店主任和个别老年职工都认为，培养一个有技术有经验的商业人员，并不像人们所想像那样简单。一个服装技工，满师以后还要试剪几年，才能做到量体裁衣；即使一个营业员，要把算盘打得飞快，也要经过半年的锻炼。因此他们认为现在就应着手培植接班人。现在上海的商业人员还有四十多万人，但其中摊贩和一般简单的商业工作人员占多数，还有一部分是为全国消费者服务的人员和从事对外贸易的人员。今年由于消费者购买力猛然上升，和人民生活密切有关的零售商店中，就感到人手不足。今后年轻力壮的熟练商业人员大批外调，年老力衰的不断退休，商业人员脱节的现象将日趋严重，而整个商业的服务水平，也会因此大大降低。
    现在，有关部门正在考虑采取措施来补充人员。有一部分行业已经开始从那些要被淘汰的行业中吸收剩余人员；有的准备把社会上的失业的原商业工作人员找回来；有的计划吸收职工家属。但大多数意见认为，最根本和长远的办法，是恢复招收学徒、艺徒或者开办商业技术学校进行训练。目前的商业职工学校中，只有文化学校、政治学校和会计、统计学校，却没有专门的商业技术学校。
    现在也有人怀疑：恢复招收学徒和开办学校，是否能保证商业人员的来源？因为社会上轻视商业工作的偏见依然存在。既然大学生、工业专科学生和工厂艺徒的来源都不足，选择商业为职业的人就不会很多。有人认为，“轻商思想”不仅是一种传统的观念，而且也是一个现实问题。到目前为止，商业人员的特殊贡献和劳动中的丰富经验，还没有获得正确的估价和社会舆论的普遍尊重。许多商业技术人员，如高级的厨师、裁剪师、照相馆摄影师、糕点技师、理发师等，都有特殊的创造，几同专家。即在一般商店中的营业员，具有特殊的服务经验的也很多。记者曾在协大祥绸布店访问过一个老职工。他不仅具有丰富的商品知识，熟练的量、算、剪的经验，而且还善于理解顾客心理。只要顾客一进门，他就可以从他们的表情、言谈和身上的衣着，知道顾客的性格和爱好，正确地帮助顾客挑选到合适的衣料。他虽然已调换过商店，但有些二十多年前的老顾客现在还非找他剪衣料不可。在百货、呢绒、文具、鞋帽等行业中，都有这样一些老营业员，他们经手的商品，只要摸一下，看一下，就可知道它们的来历、品质和性能。可惜这些有特殊技术和经验的商业人员，在报章杂志中还很少被介绍；文学家们的笔触，也几乎还没有涉及到这些终年累月辛勤地劳动着的优秀人物；他们中很多人的经验，还没有总结起来，也没有很好传播推广。这些优秀的商业人员所得到的荣誉，同其他行业也不能相比。全上海有几十万营业员，但在市中心人民公园旁边向公众宣传劳动模范事迹的“光荣廊”上，只出现了两张营业员的照片。有些具有特殊经验的商业人员，工资待遇上还有过份被压低的现象。据一家有五十多个职工的大商店的调查，最有经验的老营业员和最不熟练的营业员之间的工资待遇，过去相差达三倍之多，而现在距离已缩小为不到一倍。这种工资待遇上的平均主义倾向，显然是不利于商业工作的提高和发展的。
