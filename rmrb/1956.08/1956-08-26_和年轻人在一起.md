Being with Young People
    Hu Yihe
    I have been working in a government organization since I transferred from a school five years ago. Many of the students I taught in a middle school in Chongqing five years ago have come to study at universities in Beijing.

    Recently, one Sunday morning, a student studying at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics came to see me very early. He told me that a classmate who teaches at the Beijing Hui Nationality College was about to return to the Southwest to get married. To accommodate her, the organization decided that she would stay there after the wedding and not return to Beijing. To celebrate and to bid her farewell, eight old classmates had arranged a gathering for this Sunday, and they especially invited me to attend. Such a good opportunity for a get-together was something I could not have asked for more, so of course, I happily went with him.

    When I met the classmates, they cheered and rushed towards me, taking my hand and playfully insisting that I call out their names. After I called out their names one by one, there was another round of applause and cheers. As soon as I sat down, they eagerly introduced each other's situations. Talking and laughing with these young people, seeing their happy expressions, I was so happy that I couldn't speak. Suddenly, I remembered the scene five or six years ago when I was explaining Bing Xin's "My Classmates" to them. At that time, they were all very young and sometimes would argue over trivial matters. When I explained "My Classmates," I told them: It is rare to be in the same school and the same class. Years later, when you meet, and recall the life of your student days, you will definitely feel that your current quarrels are not worthwhile and are laughable; you should cultivate and cherish the friendship of your student days, and leave good memories for your future. Remembering this past event, I couldn't help but smile. I said, "Do you still remember Bing Xin's 'My Classmates'?" They all replied, "We remember." One said, "We all like the enthusiastic Sister Li in 'My Classmates' who serves everyone." Another continued, "At that time, our class president was very much like Sister Li. After the teacher taught 'My Classmates,' we all called her Sister Li and didn't allow anyone else to call her by her original name!" Hearing this, and recalling the scene at that time, everyone laughed again.

    Suddenly someone suggested, "Let's sing," and a burst of singing immediately filled the small room. Some stood up to conduct, some clapped their hands, and some, like experienced singers, swayed their bodies gently and movingly. Everyone's faces were filled with the unique happiness of young people, and they were all immersed in the beautiful singing. After singing, they began to recite poetry in Russian and Chinese separately.

    Facing this group of young people, I thought of the lives of college students described in the Soviet novels "Three Men in Gray Coats" and "Student Days," and I talked to them about these two novels. A girl sitting next to me said to me with some resentment, "The life of our Chinese college students is also very rich, but no one has written about our lives." Hearing this, I was slightly startled and did not answer her, but in my heart, I said with certainty: "I believe there will be. Among our Chinese writers, there will definitely be someone who will describe your rich and colorful lives."

    It was already past four in the afternoon. To commemorate this meaningful day, everyone decided to take pictures in front of Tiananmen Square. After taking pictures, I said goodbye to them. I got on the bus, and looking at Tiananmen Square shining in the sunlight from the bus window, and then looking at the backs of this group of young people, my heart was filled with gratitude and blessings. I was grateful that they gave me a happy Sunday, and I blessed them to live better in this great era.

专栏：我怎样度过一个星期日？

    和年轻人在一起
    胡一禾
    我由学校调到机关里工作，已经五年了。五年前我在重庆一个中学里教过的学生，有很多都来到北京的高等学校里学习了。
    最近一个星期天，在北京航空学院学习的一个学生一大早就跑来看我，并且告诉我在北京回民学院任教的一位同学就要回西南结婚，组织上为了照顾她，婚后就留在那里工作，不来北京了。为了祝贺，也为了送行，八位老同学约好在这个星期天聚会，特地请我去参加。这样一个聚会的好机会，在我是求之不得的，我当然高高兴兴地跟着他去了。
    和同学们见了面，他们一起欢呼着向我涌来，拉着我的手，显出顽皮的样子一定要我叫出他们的名字来。当我一一叫出他们的名字以后，又是一阵拍手和欢呼。我刚坐下来，他们就争着向我互相介绍各人的情况。跟这些年轻人在一起说笑，看到他们的幸福的表情，我高兴得说不出话来，忽然想起了五、六年前向他们讲解冰心写的“我的同班”这篇文章时的情景。当时他们都很小，有时会因为一些小事就争吵起来，我在讲解“我的同班”时曾向他们说：同校又同班，是很难得的，若干年后你们见了面，回忆起学生时代的生活，一定会感到你们现在的争吵是不值得的，好笑的；应该培养和珍惜学生时代的友谊，给你们的将来留下美好的回忆。想起这一件往事，我不禁笑了。我说：“你们还记得冰心的‘我的同班’那篇文章吗？”他们都回答说“记得”。一个说：“我们都喜欢‘我的同班’中的那位热心为大家服务的李大姐。”另一个接着说：“当时我们的班主席很像李大姐，老师讲了‘我的同班’后，我们都叫她李大姐，还不许别人再叫她原来的名字呢！”听了这话，想起当时的情景，大家又笑了。
    忽然有人提议说：“我们唱歌吧”，狭小的房间里立刻扬起了一片歌声。有的站起来做指挥，有的拍着手，有的像一位有经验的歌唱家，动人地轻轻摇摆着身子。大家的脸上都充满了年轻人特有的幸福的表情，一起陶醉在美好的歌声里。唱了歌，他们又开始分别用俄文和中文朗诵诗。
    面对着这群年轻人，我又想起了苏联小说“三个穿灰大衣的人”和“大学生”里所描写的大学生的生活，我向他们谈起这两部小说。坐在我旁边的一个女孩子颇有怨意地向我说：“我们中国大学生的生活也是非常丰富的，但没有人把我们的生活写出来。”听了这话，我略为一惊，没有回答她，但我心里却肯定地说：“我相信会有的。在我们中国的作家里面，一定会有人把你们丰富多采的生活描写出来的。”
    已经是下午四点多钟了。为了纪念这个有意义的日子，大家决定去天安门前照像。照了像，我就向他们告别了。我坐上了公共汽车，从汽车窗口望着阳光照耀下的天安门，再看看这群年轻人的背影，我的心里充满了感激和祝福。感激他们给了我一个快乐的星期天，祝福他们在这个伟大的时代里生活得更好。
