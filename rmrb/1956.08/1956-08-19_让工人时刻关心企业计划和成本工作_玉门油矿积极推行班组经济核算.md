Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 17th: In the Yumen Oil Mine's oil extraction, refining, machinery, hydro-power, transportation and other systems, there are currently 228 workshops, squads and teams implementing the team economic accounting system; another group of workshops and teams will also begin to promote this experience in September.

Since the implementation of this system in various units, the workers have become more concerned about the completion of production plans and have actively sought ways to save raw materials and reduce production costs. After the First Workshop of the Refinery implemented team economic accounting in March this year, it further promoted the competition among the various refining teams. The Wang Kuan refining team originally had unstable operations, and the production plans for gasoline and kerosene were not completed evenly. After the team's economic accountant reported these situations to all the workers, everyone launched a discussion to analyze the reasons for the unstable operations. As a result, production was improved and a large amount of wealth was saved. After the Mining Area Transportation Department began to promote team economic accounting in 29 car teams in April, 25 teams over-fulfilled the monthly production plan, exceeding the target by more than 141,000 car kilometers. The workers also saved more than 69,600 yuan in one month. After the Machinery Factory implemented team economic accounting, the workers also launched activities to not receive raw materials on workdays, saving materials worth a total of more than 39,800 yuan in five months.

In order to promote the experience of team economic accounting throughout the mine, at the beginning of March this year, the mining area trade union summarized the experience of the hydro-power plant in implementing team economic accounting, and organized relevant personnel from various units of the mine to visit and study at the hydro-power plant. Before promoting this experience, units such as the Oil Production Plant and the Machinery Factory also held training courses for economic accountants.

    让工人时刻关心企业计划和成本工作
    玉门油矿积极推行班组经济核算
    新华社玉门17日电　玉门油矿的采油、炼油、机械、水电、运输等系统中，目前有二百二十八个车间、小队、班组推行了班组经济核算制度；另外一批车间、班组，也将在九月份开始推广这项经验。
    各个单位推行这项制度以后，职工们都更加关心完成生产计划的情况，并且积极设法节约原材料和降低生产成本。炼油厂第一车间从今年三月份开始推行班组经济核算以后，进一步推动了各个炼油班的竞赛。王宽炼油班原来操作不平稳，汽油和煤油的生产计划完成也不均衡。班里的经济核算员把这些情况向全班职工报告以后，大家就展开讨论，分析操作不平稳的原因。结果改进了生产，还节约了大量财富。矿区运输处四月份开始在二十九个汽车小队推广班组经济核算以后，有二十五个小队超额完成了月度生产计划，共超额十四万一千多车公里，工人们还在一个月内节约了六万九千六百多元。机械厂推行班组经济核算以后，职工们还展开了不领原材料工作日的活动，五个月内节约的材料价值共达三万九千八百多元。
    为了在全矿范围内推广班组经济核算的经验，在今年三月初，矿区工会就总结了水电厂推行班组经济核算的经验，并且组织全矿各个单位的有关人员去水电厂进行参观、学习。采油厂、机械厂等单位在推广这项经验以前，还举办了经济核算员训练班。
