It's Time to Solve the Problem
    Sun Rongyuan
    Recently, the state-owned Jinan Department Store Wholesale Station has been busy contacting banks and superiors to seek help in solving problems such as loans because it has defaulted on 360,000 yuan in payments to the local state-owned Jinan Chemical Factory and Jinan Match Factory.

    Why does the Department Store Wholesale Station owe these two factories so much money?

    The situation is as follows: The Jinan Department Store Wholesale Station is the exclusive distributor of Huaguang Soap from the Jinan Chemical Factory. When it started exclusive distribution in 1954, sales were very good. In 1955, sales increased compared to 1954. The main reasons for the increase in sales were: at that time, soap production in various provinces outside Shandong was relatively low, and places like Tianjin and Beijing came to Jinan to purchase goods. At the same time, the Shandong Provincial Department Store adopted the practice of restricting the import of goods from other regions and rigidly allocating import tasks in the first quarter of last year. However, the market situation has changed this year, and foreign sales are difficult, and sales have decreased significantly. From January to May this year, the actual sales of this wholesale station accounted for only 44.9% of the total imports. Under such circumstances, the relevant planning departments still determined that the import plan for this wholesale station this year would increase by 95% compared to the actual sales last year. Because of this, the inventory of this wholesale station by the end of June (including last year's inventory) is expected to be equivalent to 85% of the actual sales last year, exceeding the reasonable inventory of the wholesale station by fourteen times. According to normal supply, the current inventory of Huaguang Soap is enough for sale next year.

    The problem of safety matches from the Jinan Match Factory is also the same. In the past, Jinan's matches were always sold to Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanxi and other places. In 1955, foreign sales accounted for 43% of the total sales of the wholesale station. However, the situation has changed this year. In the second quarter of this year, the sales of matches to other provinces decreased significantly compared with the same period last year. In addition, the Jinan Match Factory produces more safety matches and fewer phosphorus sulfide matches. Safety matches are expensive, and phosphorus sulfide matches are cheap, but the retail price of each small box of matches on the market is 1.5 cents. Small vendors are more willing to purchase phosphorus sulfide matches because the profit from operating safety matches is low. In addition, phosphorus sulfide matches are easy to use, and the masses of peasants are willing to buy them. Therefore, the supply of phosphorus sulfide matches on the market is insufficient, while safety matches are heavily stockpiled. It is estimated that the number of safety matches stockpiled by this wholesale station by the end of the second quarter will exceed the reasonable inventory by eighteen times.

    The overstocking of Huaguang Soap and safety matches is mainly due to the fact that the production quantity and variety of the industrial sector do not meet the needs of the market, in addition to some problems in the promotion work of the industrial and commercial departments. Poor sales of goods not only cause the wholesale station to stockpile a large amount of funds, but also make the factories' capital turnover difficult, affecting production. This situation has caused a dispute between the factory and the wholesale station for three months, and the problem has not been resolved until now. This wholesale station has also reported the situation to the relevant departments of the province and city. The match factory and the chemical factory have repeatedly reported to the relevant departments, and even to the relevant ministries of the central government, in order to demand payment from the wholesale station. However, at the production and sales balance meeting held recently by the Shandong Provincial Planning Commission (attended by the Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Commerce), the production and sales plan for Huaguang Soap and matches in the third quarter was still quite large. People are worried, what good will this do for both industry and commerce if this continues?

    The production plan of Huaguang Soap and safety matches is controlled by the State Planning Commission, and local relevant departments cannot solve it. Although the local relevant departments may give the wholesale station care in terms of loans, so that the wholesale station can temporarily have money to pay the factory, this is not a fundamental solution to the problem. The most fundamental way is to change the production plan and product variety, and adjust the product price, because if these problems are delayed again and again, the problems will become more serious. At present, this wholesale station has been affected by the excessive occupation of funds, affecting the completion of various planned targets (of course, the overstocking of other commodities in this station is also very serious), and also affecting the operation of other commodities. If this continues, the Jinan Department Store Wholesale Station will be in danger of becoming a soap and match wholesale station, and the factory will inevitably have the possibility of shutting down. By then, the country's losses will be even greater. Therefore, we hope that the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Commerce will quickly solve this problem.

    是解决问题的时候了

    近来，国营济南百货批发站因为拖欠了地方国营济南化工厂、济南火柴厂三十六万元货款，忙着向银行和上级联系，要求帮助解决贷款等问题。
    为什么百货批发站会拖欠这两家工厂这样多款子呢？
    事情是这样的：济南百货批发站包销济南化工厂的华光肥皂，1954年开始包销的时候，销路很好，1955年的销量比1954年又有增加。增加销量的主要原因是：当时省外各地肥皂产量较少，天津、北京等地都到济南来进货，同时山东省百货公司在去年第一季度又采用了限制从外埠进货和硬性分配进货任务的作法。但是，今年的市场情况有了变化，外销困难，销量大大减少。今年一至五月份这个批发站的实际销量只占全部进货量的44.9％。在这种情况下，有关计划部门仍确定今年这个批发站的进货计划，比去年实际销量增加95％。正因为如此，这个批发站到六月底的库存（包括去年库存在内），预计将相当于去年实际销量的85％，超过批发站合理库存的十四倍。按照正常的供应量，现在库存的华光肥皂足够明年销售一年。
    济南火柴厂的安全火柴问题也是这样。过去济南的火柴一向是销往河南、安徽、江苏、山西等地的，1955年的外地销量就占批发站总销量的43％。但今年情况有了变化，今年第二季度销于省外的火柴，较去年同期大大减少。另外济南火柴厂生产的安全火柴多，硫化磷火柴少，安全火柴的价格高，硫化磷价低，而市场零销每小盒火柴都卖一分五厘，小商贩因为经营安全火柴利润少，多愿采购硫化磷火柴。再加上硫化磷火柴使用方便，农民群众都愿买，因此市场上硫化磷火柴供应不足，安全火柴却大量积压。预计这个批发站到第二季度末积存的数字，将超出合理库存十八倍。
    华光肥皂和安全火柴的积压，除工商业部门的推销工作存在着某些问题外，工业部门的生产数量和品种不适合市场需要是根本原因之一。商品销路不畅，不但使批发站积压了大量资金，也使得工厂的资金周转发生困难，影响生产。这种情况，使工厂和批发站之间已经争吵了三个月，一直到现在问题还没有解决。这个批发站也曾经将情况反映给省、市有关部门，火柴厂、化工厂为了向批发站索取欠款，也曾一再报告有关部门，并且一直报告到中央有关各个部。但在最近山东省计划委员会召开的产销平衡会议上（有省工业厅，商业厅参加）确定的华光肥皂和火柴的第三季度产销计划，数字仍不小，人们都在担心，这样下去，对工商双方又有什么好处？
    华光肥皂和安全火柴的生产计划是由国家计划委员会控制的，地方有关部门无法解决。虽然当地有关部门可能在贷款上给批发站以照顾，使批发站能暂时有钱付给工厂，但这终究是不能解决问题的根本办法。最根本的办法是改变生产计划和产品品种，调整产品价格，因为如果这些问题一拖再拖，问题会更严重。目前这个批发站已经由于占压资金过大，影响到各种计划指标的完成（当然这个站其他商品的积压也很严重），也影响到其他商品的经营。如果这样继续下去，济南百货批发站将有变成肥皂、火柴批发站的危险，工厂也势必有停产的可能，到那时，国家的损失就更大了。因此我们希望国家计划委员会和商业部迅速解决这个问题。
