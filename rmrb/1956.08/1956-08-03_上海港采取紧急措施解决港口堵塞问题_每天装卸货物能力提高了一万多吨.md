Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai Port is taking emergency measures to solve the problem of port transportation congestion.

Since the second quarter of this year, hundreds of domestic and foreign ships have been entering and leaving Shanghai Port every day. The throughput of major goods such as steel, chemical raw materials, daily necessities, fertilizer, and grain has increased by half to more than double compared with the same period last year. The volume of foreign trade materials entering and leaving this port in the second quarter of this year is close to the total volume of the first half of last year. Under this new situation, due to improper labor allocation by the Shanghai Port Authority, coupled with insufficient warehouses and the impact of the rainy season, this port, which has the largest throughput capacity in the country, has experienced a shortage of loading and unloading capacity for the first time since liberation. Large quantities of goods are congested in the port, hindering port throughput. After entering the port, some freighters could not unload their goods for more than ten days; many goods piled up on the docks could not be loaded onto ships, and even the barges used for transportation within the port were filled with goods. In the fifty days from June 1st to July 20th, transportation departments came almost every day to request ships for loading; shipping departments requested the unloading of empty freighters; and production units requested the shipment of raw materials. The losses caused by not completing loading and unloading tasks within the contractually stipulated time were also significant.

In order to quickly solve the problem of cargo congestion in the port, a working committee was established under the instruction of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Since its establishment on July 17th, this committee has transferred 1,500 workers through the Shanghai Municipal Labor Department to participate in dock loading and unloading work. The inland navigation department of Jiangsu Province has also sent 400 workers to provide support. The 4,100 tons of barges transferred from the Yangtze River and other shipping departments are also participating in transportation within the Shanghai Port. In addition, Shanghai Port has mobilized more than 800 family members of workers to participate in light labor on the docks such as sifting coal, sewing cargo packages, and spreading grain for drying, freeing up able-bodied workers to load and unload freighters. At present, Shanghai Port's daily loading and unloading capacity has increased by more than 10,000 tons compared to the past. The cargo of foreign merchant ships that arrived at the port on July 20th has been completely loaded and unloaded and has left the port. More than 100,000 tons of ore, grain, and salt that had been piled up in the port for a long time have been transported by coastal and Yangtze River ships to Dalian, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, and other cities. Currently, the congestion situation in Shanghai Port is continuing to improve.

### 上海港采取紧急措施解决港口堵塞问题  每天装卸货物能力提高了一万多吨

    上海港采取紧急措施解决港口堵塞问题
    每天装卸货物能力提高了一万多吨
    据新华社讯　上海港正在采取紧急措施，解决港口运输拥挤和堵塞的问题。
    今年第二季度以来，上海港每天进出的国内外大小货船都在几百艘以上；吞吐的钢材、化工原料、日用百货、肥田粉和粮食等主要货物，比去年同期增加了半倍到两倍以上。今年第二季度在这个港口进出的对外贸易物资，接近去年上半年的总量。在这种新情况下，由于上海区港务管理局对劳动力配备不当，加上仓库不足和雨季等影响，这个全国吞吐能力最大的港口，出现了解放以来第一次装卸能力不足的现象，大批货物臃塞港内，港口吞吐受到阻碍。货船进港后，有的十多天卸不下货；码头上堆集的许多货物装不上船，连港内驳运用的驳船也囤上了货物。六月一日到七月二十日的五十天内，几乎每天都有托运部门前来要求派船装货；航运部门要求卸空货船；生产单位要求运进原料。因为没有按合同规定时间完成装卸任务而造成的损失也很大。
    为了急速解决港口货物堵塞问题，在中共上海市委员会指示下成立了一个工作委员会。这个委员会从七月十七日成立以来，已经通过上海市劳动部门调配了一千五百个工人，参加码头的装卸工作。江苏省内河航运部门也派出四百个工人前来支援。长江等航运部门调出的四千一百吨驳船，也参加了上海港内运输。此外，上海港还动员工人家属八百多人参加码头的筛煤、缝货包和摊晾粮食等轻劳动，腾出壮年工人装卸货船。现在，上海港每天的装卸能力已经比过去提高了一万吨以上。七月二十日到港的外国商船的货物，已经全部装卸完毕，驶离了港口；堆集在港内多时的十万多吨矿砂、粮食和食盐，已经由沿海和长江轮船运往大连、天津、武汉、重庆等城市。目前，上海港的拥挤和堵塞情况还在继续改善中。
