    The Secret History of the Suez Canal Company
    A. Leonidov (Soviet Union)
    The nationalization of the Suez Canal Company has thrown Western reactionary forces into confusion and fury. Perhaps never has the fate of a private joint-stock company caused such a great commotion in the capitalist world. Why is this the case this time?
    The nationalization of the Canal Company ended the existence of a special institution of Western capitalism—a "financial sanatorium" that titled Anglo-French bourgeois politicians deserved to enjoy after doing their best to serve. Even in the nineteenth century, positions on the company's board of directors were coveted prizes for many leading reactionary politicians, diplomats, generals, retired presidents, and retired foreign ministers. It was no secret that, in many cases, the desire to obtain a directorship swayed the political views of the candidates.
    No capitalist company can boast of such a distinguished board of directors. Since 1875, the Canal Company has been a strategic weapon of the British Empire in military and economic terms. At the same time, it was a fund for European financial oligarchs to reward their loyal and influential political allies. The secret history of this private enterprise is in many ways reminiscent of some of the fascinating stories in Zola's novels.
    This is why Western reactionaries were enraged when Egypt decided to nationalize the Suez monopoly. They had always regarded it as sacred and inviolable.
    The well-known International Suez Canal Company was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the former French envoy to Rome, a famous nouveau riche who was sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement in the Panama scandal. His behind-the-scenes collaborator, Napoleon III, was one of the biggest speculators on the Paris Stock Exchange at the time. (Empress Eugénie was Lesseps' niece.) Lesseps bribed the Egyptian ruler Said Pasha and his courtiers. Napoleon worked through diplomatic channels. Both were unscrupulous because their stakes were high.
    The new joint-stock company, with its office in Paris, obtained a ninety-nine-year lease from the Governor of Egypt, expiring on November 17, 1968.
    The canal was not built by the French, but by Egyptian peasants, who were forced to serve by the authorities. They worked day and night, without machines, aching and exhausted, yet without pay. The company used the same methods that had been used to build the pyramids thousands of years ago. Whole villages were wiped out, with the total number of deaths reaching 120,000—a figure that was never made public in Europe. This was one of the most significant crimes of the last century, and the vast amount of gold accumulated by shareholders in the eighty-six years since then is the interest on that crime.
    The enrichment of European financiers meant the impoverishment of the Egyptian people. By 1875, Egypt's national debt had increased nearly sixfold. The country was on the verge of bankruptcy, and even the new Governor, the French puppet Ismail Pasha, could no longer squeeze more out of his people. British capitalists seized the opportunity to overwhelm their French rivals. In November 1875, Prime Minister Disraeli—the same Disraeli who had declared the canal project "completely impossible" eighteen years earlier—decided to place the canal under British control. With a loan from the Rothschild Group, the British government secretly bought Egypt's shares from Ismail. Although this was only 44% of the total shares (52% belonged to France, and the remaining 4% to other shareholders), Britain gained control of the canal because the French shares were dispersed.
    The Rothschild Group earned 3% interest on the loan, but the Governor of Egypt had to pay Britain 5% annual interest until the company began to pay dividends. In other words, Britain not only controlled the canal—and thus gained political dominance over the Middle East—but also made the Egyptians pay the bill for the loan.
    After this, London began to regard the canal as the "lifeline of the Empire" and Egypt as another British colony. The following year, Egypt, as an insolvent debtor, was formally placed under foreign protection, and in 1882 British troops entered the country to "protect foreign property," mainly the interests of the Suez Canal Company's shareholders. The canal, which had been opened for these shareholders, cost the Egyptian people not only 120,000 lives, but also their national independence.
    The canal proved to be one of the most profitable businesses in the world. The control of the international company's shares was bought for 100 million francs in 1875. Five years later, in 1880, the company's net profit reached 12.3 million francs, in 1900—51.6 million francs, in 1920—143.7 million francs, and in 1954—10.5 billion francs. In 1930, it was estimated that the company's profits over sixty years amounted to 4 billion gold francs, equivalent to ten times the total construction cost. In recent years, the company's administrative expenses have not even reached half of its income. In 1924, the face value of each share was 250 francs; shortly before World War II, it was priced at 25,000 francs. The controlling shares that Britain paid 4 million pounds for had increased in value to hundreds of millions of pounds after World War II.
    Profits were distributed as follows: 10% to the descendants of the founders of the Canal Company, 2% to all company personnel, 2% to the directors, and 71% as dividends to shareholders. The Egyptian government's share, originally stipulated to be no more than 15%, was gradually reduced to less than 6%.
    These are the figures. For nearly a century, the Suez Company has been a parasite on international trade. Every ship passing through this waterway hub connecting Europe and Asia has to pay a fee to this private company, but this has nothing to do with the people who opened up the canal. So where did the money go?
    The largest shareholder is the British government, which holds 353,504 out of a total of 800,000 shares, accounting for slightly more than 44% of the total. Other major shareholders are large Western European monopolies, especially British, French, and Dutch shipping companies. But there are also a considerable number of shares held by British, American, and French oil companies operating in Arab countries and Iran—oil accounts for half of the cargo entering Europe through the canal. In the final analysis, the real power of the company is in the hands of these oil monopolies. For example, this year's board of directors includes: Sir Herbert Eves—former manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and Wigant de Lauan, Wittel de Mez—two senior executives of the Paris-Netherlands Bank.
    The arms companies that direct the reactionary groups in Paris behind the scenes—Vickers, Schneider-Creusot, Wendel—and the Paris-Netherlands Bank also share the management power of the company. The Paris-Netherlands Bank holds one chairman and two director positions on the board of directors. Rothschild acts as the financial agent of the Canal Company.
    Some people who implement the policies of these powerful groups can also be cited. This year's board of directors includes sixteen French, nine British, one American, one Dutch, and five Egyptian directors.
    It is not that simple to become a director. According to the company's regulations, a director must hold at least one hundred shares, equivalent to several million francs. But not every eligible shareholder has the hope of occupying a seat on the board of directors. Directors are a privileged group among the privileged. They share profits that are higher than normal dividends. In the five years from 1951 to 1955, they shared 1.147 billion francs out of a net profit of 57 billion francs.
    A director's position is practically equivalent to a generous annuity. All the work that most directors need to do is to attend a few board meetings a year and sign the meeting minutes. Each of these "annuities" amounts to millions, which are allocated by the top shareholders who elect the board of directors at the company's meetings.
    For fifty years, the directors have included two former French presidents—Casimir Perier and Gaston Doumergue; many former British and French cabinet ministers—such as F. Guillain and André Lebon, Sir Risemore, Sir Robert Horne, and some famous retired generals such as former French Commander-in-Chief General Weygand and former British Military Intelligence Director General Aldershot.
    The French who have served as directors for nearly a century also include former Foreign Minister Louis Barthou, two former Foreign Ministry Secretaries-General Jules Cambon and Charles Roux (Chairman of this year's Board of Directors); three former Ambassadors to London—Coursol, Amié de Fleuriau and Charles Corbin; former Ambassador to Italy Camille Barrère, Ambassador to the Vatican Sirieuc Jouanet (Chairman) and Ambassador to Germany Charles Loaon.
    The British directors include former Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Alexander Cadogan, Sir John Davies, the former private secretary of Prime Minister Lloyd George; Sir Ian Malcom, the former secretary of Salisbury and Balfour; Sir Francis Wiley, the former Ambassador to Afghanistan; Sir Crumwell, the former secretary of Lords Hardinge and Carnock (his father was the financial dictator of Egypt); diplomat Sir Austen Lee, William Micklethwait, Robert Isaacson; Sir Hankey—Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence from 1912 to 1938, who at the same time served as Secretary of the Cabinet and the Privy Council, responsible for presiding over the "basic formulation" of imperial strategy and foreign policy (this year he participated in the Canal Company's board of directors).
    In this way, the oil tycoons and arms tycoons had a group of reliable shareholders and directors, including retired diplomats employed by monopoly capitalists. Many of these people were still formulating the policies of capitalist Europe not long ago. And even if most of them only became directors after retirement, they cannot be regarded as ordinary employees.
    In 1948, another important figure was added to these people, another retired diplomat became a director. He was former US Minister to Egypt and Ambassador to several South American countries, Summerwell Binney Duke. Well-informed sources believe that his appointment was made after a certain American monopoly capital group acquired the Vatican's Canal shares. It is not difficult to guess the purpose of monopoly capital: the Rockefeller consortium has long been working to establish a new oil kingdom in the Middle East. To this end, it must bring the Arab countries into the dollar orbit, thereby gaining "dominance" in the region. US imperialism has always been hostile to the Suez Company—until it became one of the company's shareholders.
    It is no wonder that Egypt's legitimate decision to take over the management of the Suez Canal has caused such hysterical cries in the capitalist world. The directors of the Suez Canal Company and the monopoly capital they are appointed to defend are powerful, but the Egyptian people are much more powerful.

    苏彝士运河公司的秘史
    苏联　阿·列奥尼多夫
    苏彝士运河公司的国有化使西方反动势力陷入混乱和狂怒中。也许从来没有一个私人联合股份公司的命运会在资本主义世界引起如此的大骚动。为什么这一次会这样呢？
    运河公司的国有化结束了西方资本主义的一个特殊机构——一个为有爵位的英法资产阶级政客在尽力效劳之后理应享受的“金融疗养院”的存在。即使在十九世纪，公司的董事职位就是许多首要的反动政客、外交官、将军、退职总统和退职外长们所垂涎欲啖的肥肉。在许多情况下，得到董事职位的愿望左右着候补者的政见，这已不是什么秘密。
    没有任何一个资本主义公司能够夸言有这样显贵的董事会。自1875年以来，运河公司一直是不列颠帝国军事和经济上的一件战略武器。同时它又是欧洲金融寡头报偿其忠诚与有势力的政治同盟者的基金。这一个私人企业的秘史在许多方面令人想起左拉小说中的一些为人津津乐道的故事。
    这就是为什么西方反动分子在埃及决定把苏彝士垄断企业收为国有时被触怒了。他们一直把它当作是神圣不可侵犯的。
    众所周知的国际苏彝士运河公司，是在1858年为前法国驻罗马的公使费德南·德·勒赛普所创办的，他是有名的暴发户，由于参加巴拿马诈骗案而被判处五年徒刑。他的幕后合作者拿破仑第三，是当时巴黎证券交易所的最大的投机家之一。（皇后欧真妮是勒赛普的外甥女）。勒赛普贿赂了埃及统治者赛伊德·巴沙和他的宫廷人员。拿破仑则从外交方面下手。两者都不择手段，因为他们的赌注下得很大。
    办公处设在巴黎的新的联合股份公司从埃及总督手里得到了为期九十九年的租借权，到1968年11月17日满期。
    建造运河的不是法国人而是埃及农民，他们是当局强迫来服役的。他们夜以继日地工作，没有机器，累得腰酸背痛却没有报酬。公司使用了几千年前建造金字塔的同样的方法。整村整村的人灭绝了，死亡的总数达十二万人——这个数字从未在欧洲公开过。这是上世纪最重大的罪行之一，而此后八十六年中股票持有人所堆积的大批黄金就是这桩罪行的利息。
    欧洲金融家的致富意味着埃及人民的贫穷。到1875年埃及的国债增加了将近六倍。国家濒于破产，即使是新总督、法国傀儡伊斯迈尔·巴沙也再不能从他的人民身上榨出更多油水来了。英国资本家利用当时的局势压倒了他们的法国敌手。1875年11月，狄斯拉利首相——就是在十八年前宣告运河工程“完全不可能实现”的同一个狄斯拉利——决定把运河置于英国控制之下。凭着洛希尔集团的一笔贷款，英国政府就秘密地从伊斯迈尔那里买得了埃及的股份。虽然这只是全部股份的44％（52％属于法国，其余4％属于别的股东），但是由于法国的股份是分散的，英国获得了对运河的控制。
    洛希尔集团从那笔贷款上取得3％的利息，可是埃及总督却要付给英国5％的年利，一直到公司开始分股息为止。换句话说，英国不仅控制了运河——同时取得了对中东的政治统治——而且使埃及人来付所借的账。
    这以后，伦敦就开始把运河当作“帝国的生命线”，把埃及当作另一个英国殖民地。翌年，埃及作为无力偿还的负债国被正式置于外国的保护之下，而到1882年英国军队就开入当地去“保护外国财产”，主要是苏彝士运河公司股东的利益了。为了这些股东而开凿的这条运河不仅要埃及人民付出十二万条生命，而且还要付出他们的民族独立。
    运河证实了是世界上最有利可图的事业之一。国际公司的股票控制权在1875年以一亿法郎的代价就被人买去了。五年后，1880年，公司的纯利已达一千二百三十万法郎，1900年——五千一百六十万法郎，1920年——一亿四千三百七十万法郎，1954年——一百零五亿法郎。在1930年，人们估计公司六十年来的利润高达四十亿金法郎，相当于全部工程费用的十倍。近些年来，公司的管理开支还达不到收入的一半。在1924年，每股股票的票面价格是二百五十法郎；在第二次大战前不久，已标价到二万五千法郎。英国付出四百万英镑而取得的控制股票，在第二次大战后其价值已增到好几亿镑。
    利润是这样分配的：10％归运河公司的创业者的后代，2％归公司全体人员，2％归董事们，71％作为股东的红利。埃及政府的份额，原先规定至多不超过15％，被逐渐减少到6％还不到。
    这就是数字。将近一百年来苏彝士公司是国际贸易中的一条寄生虫。通过这条沟贯欧、亚两洲的水道枢纽的每一艘船只，要向这家私人公司纳费，但这却跟开辟出运河来的人民沾不上丝毫的关系。那末钱都到那儿去了呢？
    最大的股东是英国政府，它掌握总共八十万张股票当中的三十五万三千五百零四股，达总额的44％还多一点。其它的大股东是西欧的大垄断资本，特别是英、法、荷的航运公司。但是还有为数不少的股票掌握在在阿拉伯国家和伊朗经营的英、美、法石油公司手里——石油占通过运河输入欧洲的运货量的一半。归根到底，公司的实权是掌握在这些石油垄断资本的手里。例如今年公司的董事会包括：赫伯特·伊瓦斯爵士——前英伊石油公司经理和威甘特·德·劳安、维特尔·德·梅兹——巴黎—荷兰银行的两名高级人员。
    在幕后指使巴黎的反动集团的军火公司——维克斯，许奈特——克劳索，温台尔——和巴黎—荷兰银行，也分占着公司的管理大权。巴黎—荷兰银行在董事会里占了一个董事长和两个董事的席位。洛希尔公司充当运河公司的财政代理人。
    还可以举出一些执行这些手握大权的集团的政策的人来。今年的董事会包括十六名法国人、九名英国人、一名美国人、一名荷兰人和五名埃及董事。
    要当上一名董事可不是那么简单的。根据公司的规章，一个董事必须至少握一百股的股票，相当于好几百万法郎。但是并不是每个合乎规定的股东就有希望在董事会里占一席的。董事是特权者当中的特权集团。他们分享有比正常红利更多的利润。在1951—1955年的五年内，他们从五百七十亿法郎的纯利中分得了十一亿四千七百万法郎。
    一个董事位子实际上就等于一笔优厚的年金。需要大部分董事所做的全部工作却不过是一年参加几次董事会议，在会议记录上签签字。这些“年金”每一笔数达几百万，是由那些在公司会议上选出董事会的头号股东们指拨的。
    五十年来，董事当中包括两位前法国总统——卡息米尔·白里安和加斯东·杜美格；许多前英、法内阁大臣——例如符·居林与安德烈·勒邦，瑞斯摩尔爵士，罗伯特·荷恩爵士和一些有名的退伍将军如前法国总司令魏刚将军和前英国军事情报局局长阿尔达克将军。
    近百年来出任过董事的法国人还有前外交部长路易·巴尔都，两位前外交部秘书长茹勒·刚本和查理——卢（今年董事会董事长）；三个前驻伦敦大使——柯尔素，阿米·德·佛洛林和查里·柯宾；前驻意大使卡默尔·巴来勒，驻梵蒂冈大使西累库·若纳尔（董事长）和驻德大使查理·娄昂。
    英国董事中有前外交部常任次长亚历山大·卡道根，前首相劳合·乔治的私人秘书约翰·戴维斯爵士；索尔斯倍里和鲍尔福的前秘书伊安·马尔洪爵士；前驻阿富汗大使佛兰昔司·威利爵士；哈定兹爵士和卡尔诺克爵士的前秘书克鲁米尔爵士（他父亲是埃及的财政独裁者）；外交家奥斯汀·李爵士，威廉·米克里瑞德，罗伯特·伊萨克逊；汉恩凯爵士——1912年至1938年的帝国防务委员会秘书，就在这个时候同时，又任内阁和枢密院的秘书，负责主持帝国战略和外交政策的“基本制订”（今年他参加了运河公司的董事会）。
    就这样，石油大王和军火大王们有了一批可靠的股东和董事骨干，其中包括垄断资本家雇用的卸任外交官。许多这种人在不久以前还在制定资本主义欧洲的政策。而且纵令他们当中绝大部分是在退职以后才当上董事，但是却不能把他们看成是一般的雇用人员。
    1948年，这些人物当中又加多了一名重要角色，另一位退任外交官当上了董事。他就是前美国驻埃及公使和驻几个南美国家的大使苏末威尔·宾尼·杜克。消息灵通人士相信，他的任命是在某一美国垄断资本集团取得了梵蒂冈的运河股票之后。垄断资本的目的何在不难猜到：洛克菲勒财团早就在致力于在中东建立一个新的石油王国。为此，它必须把阿拉伯国家纳入美元轨道内，从而取得在这个地区的“统治地位”。美帝国主义一贯敌视苏彝士公司——直到它成了公司的股东之一为止。
    难怪埃及的接管苏彝士运河管理权的合法决定引起了资本主义世界这样歇斯底里的叫喊。苏彝士运河公司的董事们以及他们被任命来保卫其利益的垄断资本，实力雄厚，但是埃及人民却更是强有力得多。（黄元节译自苏联“新时代”杂志第33期）
