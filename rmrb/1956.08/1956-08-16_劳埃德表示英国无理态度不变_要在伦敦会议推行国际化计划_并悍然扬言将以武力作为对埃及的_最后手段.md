Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd delivered a radio address on the evening of August 14th, reiterating Britain's policy of "international control" over the Suez Canal.

Lloyd said: The British government will strive for a "peaceful solution" to the Suez Canal dispute, "but this solution must include some form of international control over this vital waterway."

Lloyd believes that the "main task" of the upcoming London conference is merely to "express" the opinions of the participating countries on the Western countries' proposal to establish an "international organization" to manage the canal. He said that the "international organization" to control the canal, which the Western three countries will propose to the conference, should have the "purpose and mission of taking over the management of the canal." This organization should be composed of a "management committee composed of representatives of countries mainly related to the canal," with some technical, operational, and administrative institutions below it. He also said: "In all these institutions, Egyptians and the Egyptian government will be able to play an important role."

Lloyd also said that "the idea that such an international organization would infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty simply because the canal passes through Egyptian territory is completely irrelevant to modern concepts of the true meaning of sovereignty."

Lloyd said that Egypt's action of nationalizing the Suez Canal was a "destruction of internationalization." He said that although the Suez Canal Company is "technically" a company registered in Egypt, it is essentially "internationally owned," and "Egyptian domestic law only applies to the company's organizational law and powers with consent. A company of this international nature cannot be legally 'nationalized' in the manner that has been taken."

The United Kingdom, France, and the United States have been criticized for convening the London conference while bypassing the United Nations. Now, this British official said for the first time: "We have and intend to act in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The approach we have chosen is directly in accordance with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter." He also said somewhat surprisingly: "We have always believed that there should be some connection between the international organization we are proposing and the United Nations."

In his radio address, Lloyd tried his best to convince British residents that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was a matter concerning Britain's "national livelihood, living standards, and world status." He incited hostility towards Egypt, saying that Egypt's actions were a "deliberate challenge" that brought Britain another "time of crisis."

Like Prime Minister Eden in a radio address six days earlier, the Foreign Secretary unreservedly attacked Egyptian President Nasser as an untrustworthy "military dictator" and threatened: "We must be firm. We must not allow the right to pass through the canal to depend on the momentary impulse of a military dictator." He said that Britain has taken "basic military precautions," which means "deploying several troops in the Mediterranean that can be dispatched at any time" in order to "effectively safeguard British interests when necessary." Lloyd also stated that Britain does not rule out using "force" as a "last resort" to achieve its demands.

### 劳埃德表示英国无理态度不变  要在伦敦会议推行国际化计划  并悍然扬言将以武力作为对埃及的“最后手段”

    劳埃德表示英国无理态度不变
    要在伦敦会议推行国际化计划
    并悍然扬言将以武力作为对埃及的“最后手段”
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德八月十四日晚上发表广播演说，重申英国的政策是要对苏彝士运河实行“国际管制”。
    劳埃德说：英国政府将要争取“和平解决”苏彝士运河的纠纷，“但是这种解决必须包括对这条重要水道的某种形式的国际管制”。
    劳埃德认为即将举行的伦敦会议的“主要工作”不过是“表示”一下与会各国对于西方国家所提出来的设立“国际机构”管理运河的建议的意见。他说，西方三国将要向会议建议设立的控制运河的“国际机构”，其“宗旨和任务应当是接管运河的管理”。这个机构应当由“同运河主要有关的国家代表构成的管理委员会组成”，下面设立一些技术、工作和行政机构。他还说：“在所有这些机构中，埃及人和埃及政府将可以发挥重要作用。”
    劳埃德还说，“那种认为只是因为运河通过埃及的领土所以这样的国际机构就会侵犯埃及主权的意见，是和关于主权的真正意义的现代的观念毫不相干的。”
    劳埃德说，埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动是“对国际化的破坏”。他说，苏彝士运河公司虽然“在技术上”是一家在埃及注册的公司，但是实质上却是“国际共有的”，“埃及的国内法律只有在得到同意时才适用于公司的组织法和权力。具有这种国际性质的公司是不能合法地以已经采取的那种方式来加以所谓‘国有化’的。”
    英、法、美三国一直因为撇开联合国而召开伦敦会议而受到指责。现在，这位英国负责官员第一次说：“我们已经并且打算按照联合国宪章的精神来行动。我们所选择的处理办法是直接符合于联合国宪章第三十三条的。”他还有点令人感到突然地说：“我们始终认为，我们所建议的国际机构和联合国之间应该有些联系。”
    劳埃德在广播演说中竭力要英国居民相信：埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的问题是一个关系到英国的“国民生计、生活水准和世界地位”的问题，他煽动对埃及的敌意说，埃及的行动是“有意的挑战”，给英国带来了另一次“危急时期”。
    像艾登首相在六天以前的一篇广播演说中所作的一样，这位外交大臣毫无顾忌地攻击埃及总统纳赛尔是一个不可信任的“军事独裁者”，并且威胁说：“我们必须态度坚决。我们一定不能容许通过运河的权利取决于一个军事独裁者的片刻的冲动”。他说，英国已经采取了“基本的军事预防措施”，这意味着“在地中海部署可以随时调遣的若干部队”，以便“在必需时有效地保障英国的利益”。劳埃德还表示，英国并不排斥使用“武力”作为实现它的要求的“最后手段”。
