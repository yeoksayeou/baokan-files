Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. Aktogay Station on the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway has recently become unusually busy. Two hundred and fifty train carriages loaded with various building materials have arrived at the terminal station of this "Friendship Railway."

Labor and building materials are being continuously transported to the construction site. Four hundred young people recently arrived from the Belorussian Republic and have already begun their construction specialty internships; two work teams from Tashkent have brought powerful bulldozers. Before the end of this year, they are tasked with laying 150 kilometers of roadbed and building a factory capable of producing 15,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete structures annually, a timber complex factory, and a repair base.

The Soviet section of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway is 308 kilometers long and has a total of nine stations. Although the terrain of the roadbed is very flat, many difficulties still need to be overcome, especially the difficulty of severe windstorms. In the practice of world railway construction, this railway will be the first to successfully solve the problem of constructing a railway and enabling it to operate under severe windstorm conditions.

    阿克斗卡车站空前热闹
    友谊铁路建筑准备工作展开
    新华社莫斯科9日电　最近以来，兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路上的阿克斗卡车站空前地热闹起来了。在这个“友谊铁路”的终点站上，开到了装载各种建筑材料的二百五十辆火车车厢。
    劳动力和建筑材料源源不断地运到建筑工地。不久前来自白俄罗斯共和国的四百名青年已经开始了建筑专业的实习；从塔什干来的两个工作队带有强大的推土机。他们要在今年年底以前，铺设一百五十公里的路基，建设一个能够年产一万五千立方公尺钢筋混凝土结构的工厂、一个木材联合工厂和一个修理基地。
    兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路苏联境内段全长308公里，共有九个车站。虽然路基的地势很平坦，但是仍然要克服许多困难，特别是大风暴的困难。在世界铁路建设的实践中，这条铁路将第一次成功地解决在大风暴的条件下建筑铁路和使铁路通车的问题。
