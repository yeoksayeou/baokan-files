Xinhua News Agency, August 1st Dispatch from Washington: The US Treasury Department issued a notice on July 31st stating: "It has temporarily placed the assets of the Suez Canal Company and the Egyptian government in this country under control, pending a decision on the ownership of these assets and clarification of the current situation. All transactions related to these assets must be approved by the Treasury Department."

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st Dispatch from New York: Alfred Lilienthal, legal advisor to the American National Committee for Middle East Security and Justice, issued a statement on July 30th, saying:

"The West has once again demonstrated its hysteria on the Suez Canal issue. According to international law, Egypt clearly has sovereignty over the Suez Canal Company, which is an Egyptian company. It has not blocked the canal, nor has it denied the 1888 Constantinople Convention guaranteeing freedom of navigation."

Lilienthal called the actions of London and Paris against Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal "the last gasp of British and French colonialism on its deathbed."

Lilienthal believes that the United States' recent cancellation of the proposal to provide funding for the Aswan Dam and the previous reversal of the promise to provide Egypt with military supplies, these "efforts to overthrow President Nasser," are detrimental to the United States; "fighting against the Arab-Muslim world" is also detrimental to the "Western cause." He called on the United States to adopt a policy in the Middle East that is purely in the interest of the United States.

    美政府无理管制埃及在美财产
    美国法学家指责西方对埃及采取歇斯底里态度
    据新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部在七月三十一日发表公告说：“它已经把苏彝士运河公司和埃及政府在这个国家的资产暂时置于管制之下，以待决定这些资产的所有权和澄清目前的局势。关于这些资产的一切交易都得经过财政部的许可。”
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：美国争取中东安全和正义全国委员会的法律顾问艾尔弗雷德·李连塞尔在七月三十日发表一个声明说：
    “西方在苏彝士运河问题上又表现了它的歇斯底里。根据国际法，埃及显然对苏彝士运河公司有主权，这是一个埃及公司。它并没有封锁运河，也没有否认1888年的保证航行自由的君士坦丁堡协定。”
    李连塞尔把伦敦和巴黎方面反对埃及收回苏彝士运河的行动称为“英国和法国殖民主义临死前的最后一口喘息”。
    李连塞尔认为，美国这次取消为阿斯旺水坝提供经费的建议以及上次推翻为埃及提供军火的诺言这些“推翻纳赛尔总统的努力”对美国不利；“反对阿拉伯—穆斯林世界的斗争”对“西方事业”也不利。他要求美国在中东采取一种纯粹为美国的利益着眼的政策。
