Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Ruogang reports: The Harbin Cement Plant, backed by the Songhua River and flanked by the Ashi River on both sides, has persisted in production even while surrounded by floodwaters. In the past ten days, the plant has shipped out more than 6,000 tons of cement. In front of the factory gate, high dikes have been built, and only a dedicated railway line leading into the plant remains above water.

On August 14th, the reporter followed this railway line to the factory. Inside the factory, some people were unloading soil from trains, while others were transporting soil to the dikes. Their clamor mingled with the roar of machinery coming from the workshops. The reporter walked around the dikes surrounding the factory. Behind the factory, a new dike made of red shale had been built. The dikes protecting the factory had all been raised by one meter, and the factory's chimneys were still emitting grayish-white smoke. All workshops in the factory are safely fulfilling their daily production tasks according to plan. The factory director told the reporter: The factory is now able to carry out production while surrounded by floodwaters because the flood prevention army has raised the dikes and resisted the flood.

On August 6th, the flood once washed away the roadbed of the dedicated railway leading to the factory, and trains transporting soil could not enter. The workers immediately switched to using boats to transport soil and raise the dikes. However, the flood was only a little over one foot away from the top of the dikes, and the wind and waves in the river crashed straight over the dikes, creating an extremely critical situation. The supply of soil could not keep up, and people had to stop the machines and dig soil in the factory courtyard, leveling the surrounding walls. When there were not enough straw bags, the plant's emergency rescue team immediately jumped into the water to retrieve the straw bags from the first small dike that had already been submerged. They emptied the soil in the water and retrieved more than 2,500 straw bags. When some dikes started to leak, the emergency rescue team jumped into the water to plug the leaks. After more than two days of emergency rescue, the 1,180-meter dike protecting the factory was generally raised by one meter, and the raging flood was finally blocked.

On the 8th, the machines in the workshops started up again, and the chimneys of the cement plant surrounded by floodwaters once again emitted grayish-white smoke.

Now, the flood outside the factory is in some places two meters higher than the ground inside the factory, and the workers have never relaxed their vigilance during production. After work, the workers in each workshop immediately participate in repairing the dikes. To take care of their health, the factory stipulates that they are only allowed to work for three hours. Six tents have also been set up in the factory courtyard to house people supporting the emergency repair of the dikes. All employees of the factory are now on duty around the clock, regardless of whether they are on or off duty. Temporary beds have been set up in the factory director's office and in various sections and offices, and they are sticking to their posts day and night in production and fighting the flood.

    哈尔滨水泥厂
    在洪水包围中坚持生产
    新华社哈尔滨17日电　新华社记者孙若刚报道：背靠松花江、两侧为阿什河河流环绕的哈尔滨水泥厂，在被洪水包围中仍然坚持生产，十多天来，这个厂已经运出了六千多吨水泥。工厂的大门前，垒起了高高的堤坝，只有一条通往厂内的专用铁路线还露出水面。
    八月十四日，记者沿着这条铁路线到了工厂。厂内的人们有的在从列车上卸土，有的在向堤上运土，他们的吵杂声和车间里传出来的机器的轰鸣声混在一起。记者沿工厂周围的堤坝走了一周。厂后由红色的页岩垒起了一段新堤坝，护厂堤都加高了一公尺，工厂的烟囱里仍然在冒着灰白色的烟。全厂各车间正在安全地按计划完成每天的生产任务。这个工厂的厂长对记者说：现在工厂能在洪水包围中进行生产，是在防汛大军加高了堤坝，抵抗住了洪水的情况下做到的。
    八月六日，洪水曾经冲毁了通往厂内的专用铁路路基，运土的火车进不来，职工们立即改用船来运土加高堤坝。但是洪水距堤面只有一市尺多高，江中的风浪直扑过堤坝，情况万分危急：土供不上了，人们只好停下机器，到工厂厂院里去挖土，把围墙也挖平了；草袋又不够了，厂内的抢险队员们立即跳到水里，把已经被淹没的第一道小堤的草袋捞起来。他们在水中把土倒出，共捞出了两千五百多条草袋。有的堤坝开始漏水了，抢险队员就跳到水中去抢堵。经过两天多的紧急抢救，护卫工厂的一千一百八十公尺的堤坝上普遍加高了一公尺，凶猛的洪水终于被挡住了。
    八日，车间里的机器又开动了，洪水包围中的水泥厂的烟囱，又重新升起了灰白色的烟。
    现在，厂外的洪水有的地方已经高出厂内地面两公尺，工人们在生产中始终没有放松警惕。各车间的工人下班以后，立即参加修堤。为了照顾他们的健康，厂里规定只许他们干三个小时。厂院内还支起了六座帐篷，住着支援抢修堤坝的人。厂里的全体职工现在不分上班和下班，厂长办公室和各科、室里，都搭起了临时的床铺，日夜坚守在生产和同洪水战斗的岗位上。
