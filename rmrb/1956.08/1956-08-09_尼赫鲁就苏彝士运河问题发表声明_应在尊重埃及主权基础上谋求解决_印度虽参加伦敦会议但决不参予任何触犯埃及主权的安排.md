Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced today in the People's House that the Indian government will send a representative to the London conference on the issue of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. Nehru said that the Indian government has always been very clear that it cannot participate in any meeting that imposes conclusions on participating countries in advance. The government will also refuse to participate in arrangements for any war preparations or sanctions, or any steps that violate Egyptian sovereignty.

Nehru said that India is most concerned about resolving this issue through an agreement between all relevant parties based on respect for Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, abandoning threatening postures and violence, and abandoning unilateral actions by either side.

Nehru said that, therefore, the government obtained the necessary guarantees from the United Kingdom and made its position very clear. The government is confident that its participation in the London conference will not harm Egypt's interests, nor its sovereignty and dignity. The government felt the serious responsibility it bears and decided to accept the invitation and send representatives to the meeting.

The statement made by Prime Minister Nehru in the People's House on the Suez Canal issue was also read in the Federal House.

Egypt's Sovereignty Over the Canal is Undoubted

Nehru first talked about the process of the Egyptian President issuing an order to nationalize the Suez Canal to Egyptian state ownership in his statement. He said that this caused repercussions worldwide. He said that a serious crisis has occurred, and if this crisis is not resolved peacefully, it will cause conflict, and the scope and impact of this conflict are not easy to estimate. In this crisis, the first thing to consider is to strive for a calmer atmosphere and a more rational perspective.

The Indian Prime Minister then pointed out in retrospect of the history of the Suez Canal that the canal itself is in Egypt and is an indivisible part of Egypt. Therefore, Egypt's sovereignty is beyond doubt.

Nehru also talked about the issue of maintaining the freedom and openness of the Suez Canal. Nehru pointed out that the Egyptian government's current decision seems to be to take over the Suez Canal Company ahead of schedule. There is no question of confiscation here, because the shareholders of the Canal Company will be compensated according to market prices. He also pointed out that the Egyptian government has also reaffirmed that they will respect all obligations they have undertaken under international agreements.

The Use of Force by Britain and France is Wrong

Nehru then talked about the strong reactions of Britain and France to this action by Egypt. He pointed out that the actions of Britain and France not only affect public opinion in Egypt and the entire Arab world, but also aroused great anger throughout Asia, which has not forgotten the colonial rule of the past.

Nehru said, I do not want to intensify this aroused emotion, but if I do not state that the method of threatening to use force to resolve this dispute or forcibly promoting their views on this issue is a wrong method, then I have not fulfilled my obligations to the People's House and our country, and I have not even fulfilled my obligations to all parties related to this crisis, including my obligations to Britain and France.

He said that this method is not the method of this era, and this method is not based on reason. It does not take into account the situation of today's world and the situation of today's Asia.

Nehru said: We also feel very sorry that in the various steps that caused this crisis, neither party notified or consulted each other about their own or joint practices.

Egypt Has the Right to Nationalize the Canal

The Indian Prime Minister said that we have great respect and concern for Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, and we also have great respect and concern for our friendly relations with it. Egypt's decision to nationalize was prompted by the US government's decision on the Aswan Dam issue. The United Kingdom government later took the same decision. And the way this decision was made hurt Egypt's pride and self-esteem more than the decision itself, and disregarded the feelings of a nation.

Nehru said that the suddenness of making the nationalization decision and the way it was implemented may have also contributed to these strong reactions. However, the various provisions for nationalization under Egyptian law are within the scope of the Egyptian government's authority.

Nehru also commented on the joint communiqué of the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States. He said that this communiqué recognizes Egypt's autonomous rights, but it seems to limit this autonomous right only to nationalizing assets that—in the words of the communiqué—"do not have the characteristics of international interests." If this is the point of contention, then the strong reactions and belligerent gestures—which I still hope are not war preparations—are unnecessary, and their consequences are distressing.

Nehru reiterated that he did not discuss the Suez Canal issue during his recent meeting with President Nasser. The List of Invitees to the London Conference Was Not Appropriate

When Nehru talked about India receiving an invitation to attend the London conference, he said: The Indian government does not think that the list of invited countries is appropriate. He said that excluding Burma appears to us to be a particularly regrettable omission. Yugoslavia, as a successor state in terms of the 1888 convention and also a shipping country, should also be included in the list of invited countries. India's Participation in the Meeting is Not Subject to Prior Restraints

When Nehru talked about India accepting the invitation, he said that the Indian government has requested the United Kingdom government to clarify, and felt that it has been guaranteed that its participation in the meeting does not mean that it is limited or bound by the attitudes and principles stated in the joint communiqué.

Nehru said that the Indian government realizes that Egypt cannot and will not participate in the Suez Canal conference, because in this conference it is only an invitee, and it was not consulted on the issue of convening this conference.

Nehru finally said that the Indian government has maintained close contact with Indonesia and Ceylon, as well as other countries that have taken roughly the same attitude as India on this issue.

He said: The government is well aware that this meeting cannot reach a final decision, because that requires Egypt's consent. (Attached picture)

### 尼赫鲁就苏彝士运河问题发表声明  应在尊重埃及主权基础上谋求解决  印度虽参加伦敦会议但决不参予任何触犯埃及主权的安排

    尼赫鲁就苏彝士运河问题发表声明
    应在尊重埃及主权基础上谋求解决
    印度虽参加伦敦会议但决不参予任何触犯埃及主权的安排
    据新华社8日讯　印度总理尼赫鲁今天在人民院宣布，印度政府将派代表参加在伦敦举行的关于埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有问题的会议。尼赫鲁说，印度政府始终十分清楚，它不能参加任何事先就把要达成的结论强加在与会国身上的会议。政府同样也将拒绝参加进行任何战争准备或者制裁、或者采取任何触犯埃及主权的步骤的安排。
    尼赫鲁说，在尊重埃及的主权和尊严的基础上通过一切有关方面的协议来解决这个问题，并且放弃威胁的姿态和暴力，放弃双方任何一方面的片面行动，这是印度所最关切的。
    尼赫鲁说，因此，政府从联合王国获得了必要的保证，并且十分明确地说明了自己的立场。政府确信：它参加伦敦会议并不会损害埃及的利益，也不会损害它的主权和尊严。政府感到自己所负的严肃的责任，决定接受邀请并且派遣代表参加会议。
    尼赫鲁总理在人民院就苏彝士运河问题发表的这篇声明，同时也在联邦院宣读了。
  埃及对运河的主权无可怀疑
    尼赫鲁在声明中首先谈到了埃及总统颁布命令把苏彝士运河收归埃及国家所有的经过。他说，这在全世界范围引起了反响。他说，一个严重的危机发生了，这种危机如果不是和平地解决，便会引起冲突，而这种冲突的范围和影响是不容易估计的。在这个危机中，首先必须考虑争取一个较平静的气氛和理智的看法。
    印度总理接着在回溯苏彝士运河的历史中指出，这条运河本身在埃及，并且是埃及的不可分割的一部分。因此，埃及的主权是毫无疑问的。
    尼赫鲁也谈到了保持苏彝士运河的自由和开放的问题。尼赫鲁指出，埃及政府现在的决定看来是要提前接收苏彝士运河公司。这里并不产生没收的问题，因为运河公司的股票所有者们将根据市场价格得到补偿。他还指出，埃及政府也已经重申他们将尊重他们根据国际协定，所承担一切义务。
  英法武力威胁举动是错误的
    尼赫鲁接着谈到了英法两国对埃及这一行动的激烈反应。他指出，英法的行动不仅影响埃及和整个阿拉伯世界的舆论，在还没有忘记过去所受的殖民地统治的整个亚洲，也激起了巨大的愤怒。
    尼赫鲁说，我不想加剧这种已经激起的激动情绪，但是如果我不说明威胁用炫耀使用武力的办法来解决这一纠纷或者强迫推行他们在这一问题上的观点是错误的办法的话，那我就没有履行我对人民院和我们国家所应尽的义务，甚至也没有履行我对同这一危机有关联的一切方面所应尽的义务，包括我对英国和法国所应尽的义务。
    他说，这种方法不是这个时代的方法，这种方法也不是出于理智。它没有考虑到今日世界的情况和今日亚洲的情况。
    尼赫鲁说：我们也感到非常遗憾的是，在引起这种危机的各种步骤中，任何一方都没有把他们自己或者共同的做法互相通知或者互相磋商。
  埃及有权对运河实行国有化
    印度总理说，我们对于埃及的主权和尊严非常尊重和关心，对于我们同它的友好关系也非常尊重和关心。埃及实行国有化的决定是由美国政府在阿斯旺水坝问题上的决定所促成的。联合王国政府后来也采取了同样的决定。而作出这项决定的方式比这项决定本身更加伤害了埃及的自豪感和自尊心，并且漠视了一个民族的情绪。
    尼赫鲁说，作出国有化决定的突然性和执行这一决定的方式，可能也助长了这些激烈的反应。但是，根据埃及法律实行国有化的各项规定本身则是属于埃及政府职权范围以内的。
    尼赫鲁还评论了英法美三国的联合公报。他说，这项公报承认埃及的自主权利，但是它似乎把这种自主权利仅限于把——用公报中的话来说——“不具有国际利益的特征”的资产收归国有。如果这就是分歧之点的话，那末那些激烈的反应和好战的姿态——我仍旧希望这些姿态并不是战争准备——都是不必要的，它们的后果是令人痛心的。
    尼赫鲁再次说明他和纳赛尔总统最近相会的时候，没有讨论苏彝士运河问题。伦敦会议邀请名单并不恰当
    尼赫鲁在谈到印度接到了关于参加伦敦会议的邀请的时候说：印度政府不认为被邀请国的名单是恰当的。他说，把缅甸排斥在外在我们看来是一种特别令人遗憾的遗漏。南斯拉夫，由于它在1888年公约方面说来是一个继承国，而且也是一个海运国家，所以也应当列入被邀请国。印度参加会议不受事先约束
    尼赫鲁在谈到印度接受邀请的时候说，印度政府已经请求联合王国政府加以澄清，而且感到已经得到保证：它参加会议决不意味着它受到联合公报所陈述的态度和原则的限制或约束。
    尼赫鲁说，印度政府认识到埃及不能也不会参加苏彝士运河会议，因为在这个会议中它只是一个被邀请者，而且关于召开这个会议问题并没有同它商量。
    尼赫鲁最后说，印度政府曾经同印度尼西亚和锡兰以及大致在这个问题上同印度采取同样态度的其他国家保持紧密的联系。
    他说：政府十分了解，这次会议不能够达成最后的决定，因为那需要埃及的同意。（附图片）
