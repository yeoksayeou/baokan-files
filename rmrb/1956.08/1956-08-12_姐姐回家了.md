    Sister is Home
    Cao Wei
    Today my sister came home from town,
    With a worker accompanying her.
    I dare say I recognize,
    That tractor-driving uncle, it's him!
    Last year he plowed our land,
    And two months ago, he helped our cooperative harvest crops.
    It was during that very visit of his,
    That my dear sister left home.
    He's such a good person,
    No wonder Mom always praises him.
    He's even a teacher now!
    I heard he's the one who taught my sister to drive a tractor.
    How strange, today he came and called her "Mom?"
    Mom also calls me:
    "Hurry and fetch a basin of water, let your brother wash his face first,
    Then go to the garden and pull some vegetables."
    While he wasn't paying attention,
    I gently tugged at Mom,
    "Yesterday I still called him uncle,
    How come today he's calling you Mom?"
    Mom just smiles,
    Smiles without saying a word.
    I look at my sister,
    Her face is like the pomegranate flowers in the yard!
    She hugs me tightly in her arms,
    Looks down and smiles, pursing her lips,
    Then gently scolds me:
    "Naughty little girl, what do you understand!"

    姐姐回家了
    曹纬
    今天姐姐从镇上回到家，
    还有一个工人陪着她。
    我敢说我认得，
    那个开拖拉机的叔叔就是他！
    去年他曾给我们耕过地，
    前两个月又来帮我们社里收庄稼。
    也就是他那一次来，
    亲爱的姐姐才离开了家。
    他这个人可真好，
    难怪妈妈常夸他。
    他现在还是个老师呢！
    听说教姐姐开拖拉机的就是他。
    可真怪，今天他来了直叫“妈？”
    妈妈也叫我：
    “快去打盆水，让哥哥先洗脸，
    然后再到园里把菜拔。”
    趁他没注意，
    我轻轻拉拉妈妈，
    “昨天我还喊他叔叔，
    今天他怎么叫你妈？”
    妈妈只是笑，
    笑得不说话。
    我看看姐姐，
    她的脸象院里的石榴花！
    她把我往怀里紧紧抱，
    低头抿嘴笑，
    又轻轻把我骂：
    “淘气的小妮子你懂啥！”
