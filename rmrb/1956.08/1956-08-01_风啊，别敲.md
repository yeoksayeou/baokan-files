    Wind, Don't Knock
    The wind is noisy on the deck,
    Running along the windows and steel ladders…
    Wind, don't knock,
    You mustn't knock,
    Our sailors are asleep.
    What weaves the sailor's dream?
    The longitude is—battle alert,
    The latitude is—ten thousand miles of waves,
    A brave soul is smiling in his dream.
    Wind, don't knock,
    You mustn't knock,
    Let him have a good sleep,
    Tomorrow, the fleet will sail again,
    Cutting through the ocean,
    Like a sharp knife…

    风啊，别敲
    公刘风在甲板上喧闹，沿着窗口和钢梯奔跑……风啊，别敲，你别敲，我们的水兵睡着了。是什么织成水兵的梦？经线是——战斗警报，纬线是——万里波涛，勇敢的灵魂在梦中微笑。风啊，别敲，你别敲，让他好好的睡一觉，明天，舰队又要远航，切开海洋，像一把锋利的刀
