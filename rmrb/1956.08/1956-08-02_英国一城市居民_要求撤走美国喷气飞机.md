Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: According to a Reuters report from Ramsgate on July 31st, the British city of Ramsgate, known as "Hell's Corner" during World War II because of the German Air Force's bombing, is now suffering from the torment of the American "jet threat." Residents of this city have recently launched a struggle demanding the removal of all American jet aircraft.

A recent opinion poll showed that Ramsgate residents are angry and resentful of this situation. Thousands of residents have already signed a petition demanding the removal of all American jets from the area. Former Ramsgate Mayor Bucher said: "Almost one hundred percent of the people in Ramsgate are now anti-American."

    要求撤走美国喷气飞机
    新华社1日讯　据路透社雷姆斯格特七月三十一日消息：在第二次世界大战中因为受到德国空军轰炸而被称为“地狱之角”的英国雷姆斯格特城，现在又遭到美国“喷气机威胁”的折磨。这个城市的居民最近已经发起要求撤走所有美国喷气飞机的斗争。
    最近举行的一次舆论调查表明，雷姆斯格特居民对这种情况感到愤怒和痛恨。目前已经有成千个居民签名要求把所有美国喷气机从这个地区撤出去。前雷姆斯格特市长布恰说：“雷姆斯格特现在几乎百分之百的人都是反美的。”
