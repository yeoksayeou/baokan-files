    Invisible Service Providers

    Reporting the Most Standard Time
    In Shanghai, at any time, you only need to dial "95678" on the telephone, and you can hear a clear, standard time report from the operator without even speaking. This comes from the Time Reporting Service Department of the Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau. In a small room, the operator faces an electric clock mounted on a wooden cabinet, speaking into a small microphone in their hand. They issue six reports every minute, and on average, 9,000 people (times) obtain accurate time here every day.

    The electric clock faced by the operator is connected to the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the distance. There is an astronomical clock there, and the standard time for the whole country is based on the time on this clock. In order for citizens to grasp the accurate time, the Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau has a dedicated line to communicate with the observatory. Therefore, the time reported here is the most standard.

          Wake-up Calls
    Yang Jinkui, an employee of the Shanghai Yongsheng Neon Electric Appliance Factory, had a sick child. He needed to go to the hospital the next morning to register for his child, but he was worried about oversleeping and missing the registration. In the evening, he called "97222" and asked the operator to wake him up at 4:00 a.m. the next morning. Sure enough, at the scheduled time, the phone rang for a long time. Yang Jinkui woke up and rushed to the Shanghai Children's Hospital, where he registered before six o'clock.

    "97222" is the number for the Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau's wake-up service. There is a group of dedicated personnel here to serve users. Many users request to be woken up in the middle of the night or at dawn. This number also serves as an answering service. If an exciting ball game is about to be held, but it suddenly starts to rain, you don't have to go out to check whether the game will be held. Just make a phone call, and they can give you a definite answer.

      Attentive Operators
    One evening, Chen Xingyi, an operator at the Jiangsu Road Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau, was on duty. She noticed that a person answering the phone quickly hung up, but the person making the call was unwilling to hang up. After she inquired, it turned out that a clinic in Changning District was looking for a doctor to deliver a baby. However, the doctor was at a meeting in the district. When the call was connected, the other party replied, "Cannot be reached," and hung up the phone. Chen Xingyi knew that childbirth was an urgent matter. She helped the clinic dial four times in a row and finally found the doctor.

    Chen Xingyi also used the double-handed switchboard method to increase the average number of connections per hour from more than 200 to more than 400, reducing the time users spent waiting by the phone. Now, Chen Xingyi's advanced work method has been promoted throughout the city's manual switchboards and has been welcomed by the majority of users.

      Obstacles Reduced
    Shanghai has more than 100,000 telephones, which are used non-stop every day, and various obstacles often occur. In the past, the telephone bureau always waited for users to report telephone failures before going to repair them. Now, line repairmen divide the telephones in their management area into two categories: military and government telephones and busy telephones are inspected once a month, and other telephones are inspected once every three months. In this way, obstacles have been significantly reduced. According to statistics, the number of obstacles in the first half of this year decreased by 39.7% compared with the second half of last year.

    报告最标准的时间
    在上海，随便什么时候，你只要在电话机上拨一个“95678”，不用你开口就可以从电话里听到话务员清晰的标准时刻报告。这是从上海市市内电话局报时服务处传来的。在一间小小的房间里，话务员面对着装在木柜上的电钟，口对着手里的小话筒，每分钟他要发出六次报告，每天平均有九千人（次）在这里得到准确的时间。
    话务员面对的电钟通向远处的中国科学院紫金山天文台上海徐家汇观象台。那里有一只天文钟，现在全国各地的标准时间都以这只钟上的时间为依据。上海市市内电话局为了市民能掌握准确的时间，有一根专线同观象台互通声息。所以这里报的时刻是最标准的。
          叫醒
    上海永生霓虹电器厂的职工杨金奎的孩子生了病，他要第二天早上为孩子到医院去挂号，但是担心睡过了时候，挂不到号。晚上他就给“97222”打了个电话，请话务员在明天早上四时叫醒他。果然在预定的时刻，电话便长鸣起来，杨金奎惊醒了，赶到上海市儿童医院，挂好了号还不到六点钟。
    “97222”是上海市市内电话局叫醒服务台的号码。这里有一批专职人员为用户服务，每天有许多个用户请求在夜半或天明时叫醒他。这个号码还兼做代答工作。如果一场精彩的球赛要举行了，但是忽然下起雨来，那么球赛是否举行，用不着你跑路，打个电话，它就可以给你肯定的答复。
      殷勤的话务员
    有一天傍晚，上海市市内电话局江苏路分局话务员陈兴意在值班，她发现一个接电话的人很快把电话挂断了，打电话的人却不肯挂断。她查问之后，原来这是长宁区一所诊疗站找寻医生去接生，但是医生在区里开会，电话接过去，对方回说“叫不到”，就把电话挂断了。陈兴意知道接生是急不可待的事。她帮助诊疗站一连摇了四次电话，最后找到了医生。
    陈兴意还用双手接线法，使每小时平均接线由二百多次提高到四百多次，减少了用户守候在话机旁的时间。现在陈兴意的先进工作法已经在全市人工交换台推广，受到了广大用户的欢迎。
      障碍减少了
    上海拥有十万多只电话机，每天都在不停地被人使用着，往往容易发生各种各样的障碍。过去电话局总是等用户通知电话发生障碍以后才去修理。现在修线员把自己管理区域的电话分为两类，军政电话和繁忙电话一个月检修一次，其他电话三个月检修一次。这样障碍就显著地减少了。据统计，今年上半年比去年下半年障碍减少了39.7％。
