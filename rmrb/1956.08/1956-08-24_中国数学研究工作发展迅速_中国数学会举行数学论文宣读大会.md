Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, reporter Ding Baofang reports: The first National Conference on Mathematical Papers since liberation demonstrates the rapid development of mathematical research in China. This conference was held in Beijing from the 13th to the 19th.

According to the situation reflected by mathematicians at the meeting: before liberation, China only had a small number of mathematical research talents in six schools in five cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Nanjing. Now, more than 200 mathematical researchers participating in this conference come from cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Changchun, Shenyang, Xiamen, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Qingdao. The conference presented more than 170 mathematical papers with considerable academic level, which is more than one and a half times more than the papers presented at the largest mathematical paper conference held in Kunming during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Currently, international mathematical research has formed thirteen branches, including number theory, functional analysis, and computational mathematics. China has launched research in these areas. The papers presented at this conference involved eleven branches, including topology, function theory, probability theory and mathematical statistics. Research in computational mathematics in China has only developed in the last year or two. At this conference, three papers were presented. Before liberation, very few people studied differential and integral equations, but at this conference, there were thirty papers on this topic. The conference presented eight papers on probability theory and mathematical statistics, while before liberation, only a few mathematicians engaged in research in this field.

Famous mathematicians Hua Luogeng, Su Buqing, Chen Jiangong, Jiang Zehan, etc. all presented their new works at the conference. Hua Luogeng's paper on the theory of multiple complex variable functions explored the theory of harmonic analysis on typical domains. This paper has been valued by the Soviet mathematical community. For the fourteen famous problems in analytic number theory explored by mathematicians from all over the world, there are now twenty-four best research results. Hua Luogeng mentioned in another paper on analytic number theory: twelve of these twenty-four research results were researched by Chinese mathematicians. Hua Luogeng completed eight of them. The space geometry of area measure is a new discipline that has only developed for more than ten years. To date, this new discipline does not have a complete theory. In his paper, Su Buqing used a new method to explore this theory. This new method can already solve all problems related to the calculus of variations. Min Naida's paper on the achievements of modern network research used mathematical methods to deal with theoretical problems of networks. Wu Wenjun's research paper on the theory of characteristic classes has made a considerable contribution to the development of topology as a science.

Many papers presented by young mathematical researchers also demonstrated their outstanding mathematical talents. Although they have only been engaged in mathematical research for four or five years, their papers have reached a certain level. When the old mathematicians talked about the papers of Wang Yuan, Yan Shijian, Yin Wenlin, Gu Chaohao, Xia Daoxing, Ding Shisun, etc., they all believed that this was a very gratifying achievement for the Chinese mathematics community. Chen Jingrun, who graduated from university only three years ago, spent two years of his spare time reading most of Hua Luogeng's works. His paper on the "Terry" problem made some progress on Hua Luogeng's research results.

The Chinese Mathematical Society has now grown to more than 4,000 members. The society's journal, Mathematica Sinica, has published more than 160 original academic papers. Some of these papers have received attention and praise from abroad. Hua Luogeng and Su Buqing excitedly told Xinhua News Agency reporters at the meeting: Based on the existing conditions, Chinese mathematical research is entirely possible to catch up with the international advanced level in less than ten years. They also said: China is preparing to hold a larger paper presentation conference next year.

### 中国数学研究工作发展迅速  中国数学会举行数学论文宣读大会

    中国数学研究工作发展迅速
    中国数学会举行数学论文宣读大会
    新华社22日讯　新华社记者丁宝芳报道：解放以来第一次全国数学论文宣读大会显示了中国数学研究的迅速发展。这次会议是在十三日到十九日在北京举行的。
    根据数学家在会上反映的情况：中国在解放前只有北京、天津、杭州、武汉、南京等五个城市的六个学校有少数数学研究人才。现在，参加这次大会的数学研究工作者就有来自上海、南京、长春、沈阳、厦门、西安、成都、青岛等城市的二百多人。大会宣读了一百七十多篇具有相当学术水平的数学论文，比抗日战争时期在昆明举行的一次规模最大的数学论文会上宣读的论文，多了一倍半以上。
      目前，国际上数学研究已经形成了数论、汛函分析、计算数学等十三个分支。中国在这些方面都展开了研究。这次宣读的论文，就涉及了拓扑学、函数论、概率论与数理统计等十一个分支。计算数学在中国的研究只是最近一、二年才发展起来的，在这次会上，就提出了三篇论文。关于微分方程与积分方程，解放前也很少有人研究，这次大会上在这方面的论文共有三十篇。大会宣读的关于概率论和数理统计方面的论文共有八篇，而在解放前，这方面只有个别的数学家从事研究。
    著名数学家华罗庚、苏步青、陈建功、江泽涵等都在会上宣读了他们的新的著作。华罗庚的关于多复边函数论方面的论文，探讨了典型域上的调和分析的理论。这篇论文曾经受到苏联数学界的重视。为世界各国数学界探讨研究的关于解析数论方面的十四个著名问题，现在已有二十四个最好的研究结果。华罗庚在另一篇关于解析数论方面的论文中谈到：这二十四个研究结果中，有十二个结果是中国数学家研究出来的。华罗庚完成的就有其中的八项。面积测度的空间几何学是一门发展才十多年的新学科，到今天为止，这门新学科还没有完整的理论。苏步青在他的论文中用一种新的方法探求这个理论。这个新方法已经能解决变分学有关部分的全部问题。闵乃大的关于近代网络研究的成就方面的论文，用数学方法处理了网络的理论问题。吴文俊的一篇对示性类理论的研究论文，对拓扑学的本门科学的发展有相当的贡献。
    许多青年数学研究工作者提出的论文也表现了他们突出的数学方面的才能。他们虽然从事数学研究只有四、五年的时间，但他们的论文都达到一定的水平。老数学家们在谈到王元、严士健、尹文霖、谷超豪、夏道行、丁石孙等的论文的时候，都认为，这是个中国数学界十分可喜的成绩。从大学毕业才三年的陈景润，在两年的业余时间里，阅读了华罗庚的大部分著作，他提出的一篇关于“他利”问题的论文，对华罗庚的研究结果有了一些推进。
    中国数学会现在已经发展到了四千多会员。学会主编的数学学报已发表了一百六十多篇有创造性的学术论文。其中有些论文曾受到国外的重视和好评。华罗庚、苏步青在会上曾兴奋地对新华社记者表示：根据现有的条件，中国数学研究完全有可能在不到十年的时间内赶上国际先进水平。他们还说：中国准备在明年再开一个规模更大的论文宣读大会。
