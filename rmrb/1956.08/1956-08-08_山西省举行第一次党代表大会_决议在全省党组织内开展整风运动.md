Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th -- The first congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province passed a resolution on opposing bureaucracy and adhering to the mass line. The resolution proposed that party organizations at all levels in Shanxi Province should, within the next year, universally carry out a rectification movement focusing on opposing bureaucracy, subjectivism, and dogmatism, in order to improve the party's leadership style and adapt to the more arduous tasks of production and construction in the future.

This congress was held in Taiyuan City from July 25th to August 1st, preceded by a nine-day preparatory meeting.

The congress, under the spirit of fully promoting inner-party democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom, systematically summarized the achievements, experiences and lessons of the Shanxi party organization in leading industrial and agricultural production and construction and socialist transformation over the past seven years.

The congress believes that in the face of these achievements and victories, there are also some serious shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the Shanxi party organization. The most important is that a bureaucratic style is growing in the leading organs of the Shanxi Party and government. Specific manifestations are: in work, one-sided consideration is given more to collective and long-term interests, while insufficient attention is paid to the hardships of the people's lives, even to the point of indifference. Higher-level leading organs manage affairs too broadly, and leading cadres are busy all day long, entangled in a sea of documents and affairs. They do not understand the situation below very well, and sometimes make major decisions based on subjective assumptions. When carrying out tasks, they focus on using administrative means and neglect ideological work. Insufficient attention is paid to the democratic system in party and national life, and compliance is lacking. There is a lack of self-criticism regarding criticisms and suggestions from the people, lower-level cadres, and democratic figures. Individual leading cadres have even gone so far as to suppress democracy and retaliate against critics.

Another shortcoming in the leadership style is that, in learning from international experience and summarizing advanced experiences in the province, there is dogmatism divorced from reality, and there is also narrow sectarianism toward intellectuals, so that the advanced experiences summarized over the years cannot be universally promoted, suppressing the growth of new forces and hindering the mobilization of all positive factors conducive to socialist construction. Due to the bureaucratic style in work style and the subjective spirit in ideological method, in the execution of the party's policies and lines, there are often "left" and right swings, conservatism and rash advances alternate bias.

The meeting believes that the growing complacency and the conservative hardening and blindly optimistic in thinking methods are the most important ideological sources of bureaucracy and subjectivism. Complacency makes many leading cadres divorced from the masses and reality in their work, unable to see the constantly emerging new contradictions and phenomena, and underestimate the awareness and role of the people, as a result, it frustrates the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, and brings serious harm to the party and the revolutionary cause.

In response to these problems, the meeting resolved that, starting from now, one year should be used to organize cadres above the county party committee level to study documents such as "Reform Our Study" and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," and, in combination with actual work, examine leadership, expose and criticize the mistakes of bureaucracy, commandism, and subjectivism. For general party members and cadres, party organizations at all levels should adopt a method of rotational training in batches to carry out a rectification movement. Secondly, party committees at all levels should, in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, immediately begin to study the issue of the powers of various systems in administration, personnel, and economic management, and streamline leading organs and replenish grassroots working organs. In addition, it is also necessary to improve the democratic system of inner-party life, safeguard the national legal system, and ensure that inner-party democracy and the national legal system are not destroyed by bureaucrats who abuse their power. Leading organs of the Party at all levels must strengthen investigation and research work, and provincial, prefectural, and municipal party committees must establish special investigation and research institutions. At the same time, attention should be paid to simplifying meetings and documents in leadership methods, and responsible cadres of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal party committees should spend a certain amount of time each year going to the countryside and factories, and leading cadres of county-level and factory and enterprise party committees should go deep into grassroots organizations. The resolution also advocated that party committees at all levels adopt various forms to closely link leaders with the masses, and conduct a general inspection of the living conditions of the broad masses in the near future to solve the difficulties and problems that can be solved as soon as possible.

The meeting also heard the work reports made by the former Provincial Party Committee First Secretary Tao Lujia, and passed a resolution on consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives. The congress proposed that the current tasks of the Shanxi Provincial Party Organization are: to make full use of the rich underground resources and build Shanxi Province into a comprehensive heavy industrial base; to vigorously develop agricultural production, actively consolidate and develop the victorious achievements of socialist transformation, consolidate socialist relations of production in agriculture, and create better conditions for industrial development; at the same time, with the development of industry, to implement technological reforms in various aspects of the national economy in a planned and gradual manner, so as to fundamentally change the economic face of Shanxi.

The congress elected new members and alternate members of the Provincial Committee, as well as representatives to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

### 山西省举行第一次党代表大会  决议在全省党组织内开展整风运动

    山西省举行第一次党代表大会
    决议在全省党组织内开展整风运动
    据新华社太原5日电　中国共产党山西省第一次代表大会作出了关于反对官僚主义，坚持群众路线的决议。决议提出山西省各级党组织要在最近一年内普遍开展以反对官僚主义、主观主义和教条主义为主要内容的整风运动，以改进党的领导作风，适应今后更加繁重的生产建设任务。
    这次代表大会是七月二十五日到八月一日在太原市召开的，会前曾开了九天的预备会议。
    大会在充分发扬党内民主、开展自上而下的批评和自我批评的精神下，系统地总结了山西党组织在过去七年内领导工农业生产建设和社会主义改造事业的成就和经验教训。
    大会认为，在这些成就和胜利面前，山西党组织的领导上也存在着一些严重缺点和错误。最主要的是在山西党和政府领导机关中滋长着一种官僚主义作风。具体表现是：工作中片面考虑集体利益和长远利益多，对人民生活疾苦关心不够，甚至不闻不问。上级领导机关管事太宽，领导干部终日忙碌，纠缠在文牍和事务的大海里。对下情不甚了解，有时凭主观臆断决定重大问题。执行任务时偏重于使用行政手段，忽视思想工作。对党内生活和国家生活中的民主制度重视不足，遵守不够。对来自人民群众、下级干部和民主人士的批评建议，缺乏自我批评精神。个别领导干部更发展到压制民主，对批评者施行打击报复。
    领导作风上的另一缺点是，在学习国际经验和总结本省先进经验中，有脱离实际的教条主义，对知识分子还有狭隘的宗派主义，以致历年来总结的先进经验不能普遍推广，压抑了新生力量的成长，妨害了调动一切有利于社会主义建设的积极因素。由于作风上的官僚主义和思想方法上的主观主义，在执行党的方针路线上便时常发生“左”右摇摆、保守和冒进迭次更替的偏向。
    会议认为正在滋长的骄傲自满情绪和思想方法上的保守硬化盲目乐观是产生官僚主义和主观主义最主要的思想根源。骄傲自满情绪使不少领导干部在工作中脱离群众，脱离实际，看不到不断出现的新的矛盾现象，低估了人民群众的觉悟和作用，结果，挫折了广大人民的社会主义积极性和创造性，对党对革命事业带来严重危害。
    会议针对这些问题，决议从现在起，以一年的时间组织县委以上干部学习“改造我们的学习”、“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”等文件，并且结合实际工作，检查领导，揭发和批判官僚主义、命令主义和主观主义的错误。对一般党员干部，由各级党组织采取分批分期轮训的方式进行一次整风。其次，各级党委要根据民主集中制的原则，立即着手研究有关各系统在行政、人事和经济管理等方面的职权问题，并且精简领导机关，充实下层工作机构。另外，还要健全党内生活的民主制度，维护国家法制，保证使党内民主和国家法制不被滥用职权的官僚主义者所破坏。各级党的领导机关都要加强调查研究工作，省委、地委、市委建立专门的调查研究机构。同时，在领导方法上注意精简会议和文件，省委、地委、市委负责干部每年要有一定时间下乡下厂，县一级和工厂企业党委的领导干部要深入基层组织。决议中还提倡各级党委采取多种形式以密切领导和群众的联系，并且在最近对广大群众生活状况进行普遍的检查，尽快解决能够解决的困难和问题。
    会议还听取了前届省委会第一书记陶鲁笳等作的工作报告，通过了关于巩固农业生产合作社的决议。大会提出：山西省党组织当前的任务是：充分利用地下丰富的资源，把山西省建设成一个综合性的重工业基地；大力发展农业生产，积极巩固和发展社会主义改造的胜利成果，巩固农业中的社会主义生产关系，给工业发展创造更好条件；同时，随着工业的发展，有计划地逐步地在国民经济的各个方面实行技术改革，以便从根本上改变山西的经济面貌。
    大会选出了新的省委员会委员和候补委员，以及出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表。
