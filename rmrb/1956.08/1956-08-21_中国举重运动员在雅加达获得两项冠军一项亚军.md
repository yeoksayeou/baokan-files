Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 20th. Chinese weightlifters won two championships and one runner-up in the first day of competition at the four-unit weightlifting competition between China, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaya held in Jakarta on the 18th. They also broke three national official records for total scores.

　　Chinese weightlifter and world record creator Chen Jingkai won the flyweight championship, breaking the national record of 295 kg for flyweight with a total score of 300 kg.

　　The bantamweight champion was Chinese weightlifter Chen Yongbo, who broke the national record of 295 kg for bantamweight with a total score of 305 kg.

　　In the lightweight competition, Chinese weightlifter Huang Qianghui lost to Singaporean athlete Chen Haoliang by 2.5 kg, taking second place. Huang Qianghui's total score was 345 kg, breaking the national record of 342.5 kg for lightweight.

　　On their way to Indonesia, the Chinese weightlifters arrived in Jakarta by plane only two days before the competition (August 16th) due to airplane seating arrangements. They lacked necessary training and rest, which affected their performance. For example, Chen Jingkai broke the national official record for flyweight total score with 305 kg in June this year. This time, his clean and jerk score was 8 kg less than his world record of 133 kg. Huang Qianghui's highest total score in China had reached 350 kg.

　　The competition was held at the Ikada Stadium in Jakarta. Several thousand spectators watched the competition with great satisfaction.

    中国举重运动员在雅加达获得两项冠军一项亚军
    新华社雅加达20日电　中国举重运动员十八日在雅加达参加中国、印度尼西亚、新加坡和马来亚四单位举重对抗赛的第一天比赛中，获得了两项冠军和一项亚军，并且打破了三项总成绩的全国正式纪录。
    中国举重运动员、世界纪录创造者陈镜开获得了最轻量级冠军，他以三百公斤的总成绩打破了最轻量级295公斤的全国纪录。
    获得次轻量级冠军的是中国举重运动员陈永博，他以305公斤的总成绩打破了次轻量级295公斤的全国纪录。
    在轻量级比赛中，中国举重运动员黄强辉以2.5公斤之差输给新加坡选手陈浩亮，获得第二名。黄强辉的总成绩是345公斤，打破了轻量级342.5公斤的全国纪录。
    中国举重运动员在来印度尼西亚途中，由于飞机座位关系直到比赛前两天（十六日）才坐飞机到达雅加达。他们缺少必要的练习和休息，因此成绩受到了影响。例如陈镜开今年六月就曾经以305公斤打破了最轻量级总成绩的全国正式纪录。这次他的挺举成绩比他所保持的133公斤的世界纪录少了八公斤。黄强辉在国内的最高的总成绩曾经达到350公斤。
    这次比赛是在雅加达的伊卡达体育场举行的。几千个观众很满意地看完了比赛。
