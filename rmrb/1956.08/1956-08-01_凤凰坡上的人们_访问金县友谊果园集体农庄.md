    The People on Phoenix Slope
    ——Visiting the Jin County Friendship Orchard Collective Farm
    By our special correspondent Xiao Qian
    
    3. Guests at the Farm
    
    Before coming to the farm, I was prepared to live a bit rougher. But at dinner, I only tore off two jiao and some change worth of “farm meal tickets,” and the cook smilingly passed me a plate of braised chicken pieces, a bowl of steaming hot cabbage and tofu soup, and a large steamed bun that I worried I wouldn’t be able to finish through the serving window from the kitchen.
    
    The dining hall was packed with people. There were single farm members and guests from all over. A female student, short in stature and wearing thick glasses, with a "Shenyang Agricultural College" badge on her chest, was eating soft-fried shrimp while talking with relish about how she had gone to see a classmate who was interning at the Deli Temple Farm yesterday, and how they had recently caught a mother wolf with snares. She first described how tender and fragrant the wolf meat that the farm members had received was, and then spoil-sportingly said, "But the male wolf comes to the village every day, howling for half the night, making the timid classmates afraid to go out after dark."
    
    In a corner of the dining hall, I saw Chairman Ma of the farm. He immediately explained that his wife (one of the ten production team leaders on the farm) had gone to Jin County for a meeting, and that he had joined the ranks of the bachelors today. I told him that I didn't expect to eat such good food in a mountain gully, and he said, "Our master chef is really something. He studied abroad." After further questioning, I learned that this master chef, originally from Henan, used to be a cook for a large landlord in Shenyang. The landlord thought his cooking was not up to par with that of restaurants, so he specifically sent him to the Tanhua Restaurant for "advanced studies" at noon.
    
    As Chairman Ma spoke, the master chef in the white apron was loudly banging the wok in the next room, and then, as if by magic, a bright flash of fire immediately appeared at the bottom of the wok.
    
    "No fooling around, he studied for two years," Chairman Ma enthusiastically recommended the farm's expert.
    
    Chairman Ma ate in a military style. He stood up and left. At this time, I noticed an old farm member in his fifties sitting diagonally across from me, holding a bowl of millet porridge and slurping it down.
    
    "Your wife is also at a meeting, right?" I went over and, using the formula I had just learned, made a guess.
    
    He shook his head very firmly, saying that he had no wife, only an eighty-year-old mother in his old home in Shandong.
    
    "Did your wife pass away?" I guessed again.
    
    "No, I never married at all. In the past, how could I afford to get married! Now, alas, no one is willing to come!"
    
    Looking at his balding head and his wrinkled face, I thought: The old society deprived him of everything, and the new society can make up for everything for him, but youth, that can't be made up for.
    
    This person seemed to see what I was thinking, and smiled, as if comforting himself: "Family or no family, it doesn't matter. The farm is my home!"
    
    After dinner, the single farm members went back to their team headquarters, and most of the female students who came to intern slept in the homes of the farm members, while the men slept on the stage in the clubhouse. Finally, only five or six guests remained in the office. Apart from me, they could all be said to be experts: there was a plant pathologist sent by the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, an engineer who came to help the farm build a reservoir, a junior agronomist who was giving technical classes to the farm members, and a technician sent by the China Insurance Company to delve into the farm's production process in order to study insurance regulations. Under the candlelight, they each took out files they had brought, such as "Apple Summary" and "Map of Cotton Insect Infestation in the Lushun-Dalian Area," and then took out notebooks to check them against the actual situation they had observed and understood in the production teams during the day.
    
    The moon climbed up the side of Daheshang Mountain, peeking in through the window. Several of us guests sharing the same kang started chatting in the faint blue moonlight and quickly found a topic of common interest: the threat of natural disasters to the farm.
    
    The comrade from the insurance company said: "The wind is really unkind, it can blow off 640,000 jin of apples in one night!" The tall plant pathologist in the yellow khaki uniform straightened the glasses on his nose and said in an undeniable solemn tone: "The wind is not the biggest enemy of fruit trees. The most ferocious and tenacious enemy of fruit trees is insects. Can you guess how many generations an aphid reproduces in a year?" Everyone held their breath, waiting for the expert to announce this terrible number. "More than forty generations!" He said the number through gritted teeth. Then he added, "Cotton insects, which eat roots, stems, branches, and fruits, have thirteen generations, red spiders, which gnaw on leaves, have seven generations. And there are also peach fruit borers, which specialize in drilling into the core of apples, and have two generations!"
    
    The expert felt that this series of alarming numbers had attracted everyone's attention, so he further analyzed: "It's not that simple to exchange apples for steel. When apples are shipped to Manchuria, the buyers will conduct spot checks. If one box is infested with insects, the entire trainload of apples is in trouble. Even if they arrive at the destination, they still have to check with a microscope. If there is a problem this year, it will be difficult to export next year. ... Moreover, our government, for the sake of international reputation and trade ethics, will not allow those with insects to be exported!"
    
    The junior agronomist from Shenyang continued: "Don't just see that the profit of fruit trees is greater than that of ordinary crops, you also have to worry about it all the time. There is no rest all year round. In winter, you have to prune the trees, and in spring, you have to irrigate and fertilize, and constantly spray sulfur solution and scrape the bark. When the farm was still small last year, the farm members made many large sieves and sifted the soil under tens of thousands of fruit trees. The female farm members knelt down and sifted every day, wearing out their trousers, and sifting out hundreds of pounds of 'peach small' pupae. Their slogan is: Pinching off one insect guarantees the quality of one hundred and twenty-five jin of apples, which is equivalent to two hundred and fifty jin of steel!"
    
    Speaking of this, the plant pathologist, by the light of the candle and the moon, spread out the "Pest Control Plan for the Lushun-Dalian Area" for me to see. This can be said to be the deployment of the people's government using scientific weapons to combat pests and diseases. The golden candlelight danced on the expert's face, and the moonlight made the half of his face facing the window look a little gaunt. He held the corner of the table with one hand and gestured on the map with the other, like a commander on the front line: the red line is the blockade zone, and the arrow points to the direction of possible spread. Then he raised his head and said with confidence: "These harmful things don't have many days to live! We will eliminate them inch by inch, and within two years, we can eradicate cotton insects in this area, and within five years, we can eradicate red spiders."
    
    Obviously, there is still a fierce and intense battle ahead of this grand vision.
    
    4. Old and Young Breeders
    
    On the green Phoenix Slope, the most eye-catching are the white chicken coops. Last year, in addition to providing eggs for the farm members, the farm also sold 190,000 eggs to the supply and marketing cooperative, which were picked one by one from those chicken coops.
    
    Is it true that you can't learn new things when you get older? Ma Zhenjiu, 48, doesn't believe in this "conventional wisdom." He had never raised chickens before, let alone these delicate "foreign chickens" that get heatstroke easily and catch colds easily. However, since March of the year before last, the farm has assigned him to the livestock team's chicken raising group to look after the chicken coops, from morning till night, serving as the breeder and guard for 350 Leghorn chickens with red crowns and white feathers. In the past two years, Ma Zhenjiu has not only become familiar with the temperament of the chickens, but also can judge their ability to lay eggs from the color of their mouths, anus, and legs.
    
    Every day, he gets up at four o'clock in the morning to feed the first time, and after feeding the sixth time at seven o'clock in the evening, he gently closes the door of the chicken coop and sends the "babies" to sleep. Feeding is easy, but watering is difficult. In winter, they have to be given warm water to drink, and in hot weather, he specifically goes to a well at the bottom of the hillside to scoop up cold water. Chickens don't like to drink dirty water, so the basins always have to be scrubbed clean, and you can't add too much each time, you have to add frequently. In this way, the chickens will naturally stick out their tails and drink with all their might. It's not enough to just feed them, you have to let them do "exercises." Ma Zhenjiu hangs the spinach neither too high nor too low, so that the chickens can peck at the edge, but can't eat it. In this way, they will naturally stretch their necks, stand on their palms, flap their wings, and actively make various exercise postures.
    
    In the two years he has been at the chicken coop, he has suffered a lot of fatigue and anxiety. The winter before last, he asked for a leave of absence and asked someone else to look after him. The chickens were clamoring to get out, and the person released them without asking about the weather, on the coldest days of winter. As a result, hundreds of chickens got sick. This made Ma Zhenjiu stomp his feet in anxiety. He gave the chickens penicillin overnight, washed them with boric acid, and applied iodine to their throats. It was only with great difficulty that each one was saved.
    
    Last July, on a moonless night, at about two o'clock in the morning, Ma Zhenjiu heard the chickens cackling. He put on his clothes, picked up an electric baton, and shined it. Whoa, the front paw of a vicious wolf was lying on the window frame of the chicken coop, its eyes shining brightly. Ma Zhenjiu grabbed a stick and chased after it, and the guy tucked its tail and slipped behind the mountain.
    
    In winter, he didn't know which house an eagle had escaped from, with a copper chain tied around its neck. It grabbed a chicken with one claw. Ma Zhenjiu was mixing food for the chickens when he suddenly felt a jump in his heart and immediately sensed that something was wrong. He turned the corner of the wall and, sure enough, the eagle was pressing the chicken on the ground, preparing to eat it. Ma Zhenjiu didn't have time to grab a stick, so he bent down and grabbed a stone, and slashed fiercely at the intruder. The eagle was knocked over, injured, and flew away crookedly. Ma Zhenjiu calmed the chicken, applied medicine, wrapped it up, and after a few days it actually started laying eggs again.
    
    On the afternoon of "May Day" this year, he heard the chickens flapping their wings and screaming again. This time, a chicken was already in the fox's mouth. Ma Zhenjiu was still not reconciled. He couldn't let it taste the sweetness. He chased after it, one foot deep and one foot shallow, on the terraced fields, and chased it to the middle of the mountain where he forcefully snatched a bloody dead chicken from the fox's mouth. Since then, the fox has never come to his door again.
    
    While we were talking, groups of Leghorn chickens kept flying to the window frames, blinking their eyes and looking inside, chattering and discussing. I asked Ma Zhenjiu if I could take a picture of him in the chicken coop. He touched his chin, thought for a moment, and then solemnly made a condition to me: "Comrade, you have to disinfect first, and when you go in, stick to the fence, walk slowly, don't scare them. Don't touch anything."
    
    Outside the chicken coop, there was a wooden box filled with lime. He carefully watched me step on it several times with my feet before nodding his head and letting me in. The solemnity and seriousness of the ceremony made me feel that I was not entering a chicken coop, but a sacred temple.
    
    On the way down the mountain, we passed another chicken coop and met a thin, tall, young breeder with a lot of childishness on his face. He had just finished feeding the chickens and was walking out of the chicken coop with an empty dustpan. This was Zhao Guoqin, a graduate of junior high school who joined the farm the year before last.
    
    At this time, hundreds of Leghorn chickens were crowded on both sides of the long trough, stretching their necks, and making satisfied sounds from their throats as they ate.
    
    We stood outside the chicken coop and started chatting with him.
    
    "The science of raising chickens is very profound!" He tilted his head and said very seriously, as if he felt something, and as if he was telling me not to underestimate this industry. No wonder, the farm sent him to the Yingchengzi Experimental Station for seven months to study, learning about breeding, incubation, and even dissection. When he came back, he thought he knew everything this time. But when he encountered problems, he often had to write letters to the teachers at the experimental station.
    
    "One night, a chicken was obviously fine, but in the morning it wouldn't get off the shelf, or it couldn't get on the shelf at night." As he spoke, he frowned, as if evoking some painful memories. "Then the chicken's crown turned purple, and its muscles became numb. A perfectly good chicken was just gone like that."
    
    After saying this, he quickly looked at the chicken coop with concern. Some of the chickens were quick to eat and had already raised their heads and were walking along the fence very proudly, while others were burying their heads in the trough to pick up scraps.
    
    Now, Zhao Guoqin can treat most of the common diseases, and sometimes he even performs surgery on the chickens. He disinfects the chickens every week and gives them some purgatives from time to time. But he is worried about this "heatstroke." This year, he came up with a way to plant some climbing gourds and melons around the fence, and plans to use the leaves of these plants to build a sunshade for the chickens.
    
    When we parted, I asked him about his ideal, and the young farm member's expression was a little shy, but very firm: "I want to be a chicken pathologist." (To be continued)

    凤凰坡上的人们
    ——访问金县友谊果园集体农庄
    本报特约记者　萧乾
    三、农庄上的客人
    来农庄以前，生活上我是准备吃点苦的。可是晚饭的时候，我只撕下两角多钱的“农庄餐券”，炊事员就笑眯眯地由厨房的洞洞里递给我一盘红烧鸡块，一碗热腾腾的白菜豆腐汤，一个大得我发愁会吃不完的馒头。
    饭厅里密密匝匝挤满了人。这里有单身的庄员，也有各地来的客人。一个个子不高、戴着深度近视镜的女学生，胸前佩着“沈阳农学院”的徽章，一边夹着软炸虾仁，一边津津有味地讲着昨天放假，她去找一个在得力寺农庄实习的同学，他们那里新近用卡子捉到一条母狼。她先形容了一下庄员们分到的狼肉有多么香嫩，然后又杀风景地说：“可是公狼天天到庄上来，嗷嗷地一叫就是半夜，弄得胆小的同学一擦黑就不敢出去了。”
    在饭厅一个角落里，我看到了农庄的麻主席。他迎头先向我解释说，爱人（是农庄上十个生产队长之一）上金县开会去了，他今天也加入了单身汉的队伍。我告诉他没想到在山沟儿里会吃到这么好的菜，他说：“俺们这位大师傅就是有两下子。他是留过学的。”细一追问，才知道这位原籍河南的大师傅从前在沈阳给一个大地主当过厨子。地主嫌他的手艺赶不上馆子，特意派他中午到探花楼去“进修”。
    主席讲到这里，那位穿着白围裙的大师傅正在隔壁响亮地敲着炒杓，随后像魔法一样，炒杓底儿上立刻就闪出一道贼亮亮的火光。
    “不含糊，人家留了两年学呢，”麻主席很有风趣地推荐着农庄上的这位专家。
    主席吃饭是行军式的。他站起来走了，这时候，我发现一个年纪五十开外的老庄员坐在我斜对面，正端着碗小米粥，唏哩呼噜地喝着。
    “爱人也开会去了吧？”我凑过去，套用着刚才学来的公式。
    他十分坚决地摇了摇头，说他没有爱人，只在山东老家有位八十多岁的老母。
    “爱人去世啦？”我又猜了一下。
    “不，压根儿就没娶过。以前，哪娶得起！如今晚儿，唉，没人肯来啦！”
    我望着他那歇了顶的脑袋，和那张布满了皱纹的脸，心里想：旧社会剥夺他的一切，新社会都能替他弥补，可就是青春，那是没法子弥补了。
    这个人好像看出我的心思，又好像宽慰着自己似的笑了笑说：“家不家的，没啥。农庄就是俺的家！”
    饭后，单身的庄员各自回了队部，来实习的女同学多半分睡在庄员家里，男的睡在俱乐部的舞台上。最后办公室里只剩下五、六个客人。这里，除了我以外，可以说都是专家：有农林局派来的病虫学家，有来帮农庄修水库的工程师，有正给庄员开技术班的见习农学家，还有中国保险公司派来深入农庄生产过程、好研究保险条例的技术员。在烛光底下他们一个个从皮包里拿出“苹果总结”，“旅大区棉虫蔓延图”一类带来的文件，然后掏出笔记本来，跟他们白天在生产队里观察了解的实际情况核对着。
    月亮爬在大和尚山边上，从窗口探着头。我们几个同炕的客人就趁着淡蓝色的月光扯了起来，很快就找到了共同感到兴趣的题目：自然灾害对农庄的威胁。
    保险公司的同志说：“风这玩意儿可真不善，一晚上能刮掉六十四万斤苹果！”那位高高个子、穿黄咔叽制服的病虫学家正了正鼻梁上的眼镜，用不容人忽视的庄重语气说：“风还算不上果树顶大的敌人，果树顶凶恶顶顽强的敌人是虫子。你们猜猜看，一条蚜虫一年繁殖多少代？”大家都屏了声息，静等着专家宣布这可怕的数字。“四十几代！”他是咬着牙齿说出这个数字的。接着他又说：“根、茎、枝、果全吃的棉虫是十三代，啃叶子的红蜘蛛是七代。还有专门往苹果心儿里钻的桃小食心虫是两代！”
    这位专家感到他这一串惊人的数字吸引住了大家，就进一步分析说：“用苹果换钢材也不是那么简单的事。苹果运到满洲里，买主儿要抽查，一箱子生了虫，一列车的苹果都成问题。就是运到了目的地，人家也还要拿显微镜检查。今年有了毛病，明年就不好出口了。……而且咱们政府为了国际上的信誉，为了贸易道德，有虫子的自己也不让出口啊！”
    从沈阳来的见习农学家接着说：别只瞧见果树的利润比普通庄稼大，心可也操老了去啦。一年四季没个闲。冬天要剪树形，春天一道道地灌溉施肥，还得不断地喷硫磺水儿，刮树皮。去年农庄规模还小的时候，庄员们做了不少只大筛子，把几万棵果树下面的土都筛遍了。女庄员成天跪着筛，裤子也磨破了，筛出百十多斤“桃小”的虫蛹来。她们的口号是：掐死一条虫子，就保证一百二十五斤苹果的质量，那就等于二百五十斤钢！
    说到这里，病虫学家就着烛光和月亮，摊开“旅大区灭虫规划”给我看。这可以说是人民政权使用科学武器跟病虫作战的部署。黄澄澄的烛光在这位专家的脸上跳跃着，月光把他向窗的半边脸照得有些青癯。他一只手扶着桌角，另一只像前沿上的指挥官似的在地图上比划着：红线是封锁区，箭头指的是可能蔓延的方向。然后他抬起头来，很有把握地说：“这些害人的东西没多少日子好活啦！咱们一方尺一方尺地消灭，两年以内，足可以叫这个地区的棉虫绝了种，不出五年，可以根除红蜘蛛。”
    显然，在这个宏愿前面还有一场激烈紧张的战斗。
    四、老少饲养员
    在绿色的凤凰坡上，最引人注目的是一幢幢白色的鸡舍。去年农庄除了供给庄员吃，还卖给供销社十九万个鸡蛋，那就是从那些鸡舍里一个个捡的。
    上了年纪就不能学新东西了吗？四十八岁的麻振久可不相信这套“成规”。他一向没养过鸡，更没养过这种一来就中暑、二来就感冒、又娇又嫩的“洋鸡”。然而从前年三月起，农庄就把他派到牲畜队养鸡组来看鸡舍，从早到晚，给三百五十只红冠子，白羽毛的莱亨鸡当饲养员和警卫。两年来，麻振久不但摸熟了鸡的脾气，并且能从鸡的嘴巴、肛门和腿部的颜色判断它们下蛋的能力。
    每天黑早交四点，他就起来喂第一遍，晚七点喂完第六遍，他才轻轻关上鸡舍的门，打发那些“宝贝儿们”去睡觉。食好喂，水可难喂。冬天得给它们温水喝，热天他特意到山坡底下的一口井里去舀凉的。鸡不喜欢喝脏水，盆子老得刷得干干净净的，每回别添多了，得勤着添。这样，鸡才会撅起尾巴一个劲儿地喝。光给它们吃喝还不行，得叫它们做做“工间操”。麻振久把菠菜吊得不高不矮，叫鸡能吀着点边儿，可又吃不着。这样它们自然就会伸长脖子，拔起掌来，扇动翅膀，活跃地做出各种运动的姿势。
    到鸡舍这两年他累没少受，急也没少着。前年冬天他请了趟事假，托别人替他看看。鸡闹着要出来，那人也不问气候，三九天就把鸡放出来了。于是，百八十只鸡都病了。这下把麻振久急得直跺脚。他连夜给鸡打盘尼西林，用硼酸水洗，往嗓子里点碘酒，好容易一只只才算是都救活了。
    去年七月，一个没有月亮的夜晚，约摸两点多钟光景，麻振久听见鸡嘎嘎嘎地叫了起来。他披上衣裳，抄起电棒一照，喝，一条恶狼的前爪正趴在鸡舍的窗棂上，眼睛贼亮贼亮的。麻振久抓起根棍子就追，那家伙夹着尾巴溜到山后头去了。
    冬天，也不知道从哪家跑出一只老鹰，脖子上还拴着一根铜链子。它一爪子攫住一只鸡。麻振久正在给鸡拌食，忽然心一跳，立刻感觉出了乱子，转过墙角，果然老鹰正把那只鸡按在地上，准备下口。麻振久来不及抄棍子了，就弯腰抓起一块石头，狠命朝这个闯入者砍去。老鹰给砍了个跟头，受了伤，歪歪斜斜地飞掉了。麻振久给那只鸡压了惊，上了药，包裹起来，过了几天它居然又下起蛋来。
    今年“五一”那天的下午，他又听到鸡扑扇起翅膀，惊叫起来。这回，一只鸡已经叼在狐狸嘴里了。麻振久还是不甘心。死活也不能叫它尝到甜头。他在梯田上深一脚浅一脚地追，追到半山腰他硬打狐狸嘴巴里把一只血淋淋的死鸡抢了回来。从那以后，狐狸再也没上过门。
    我们谈话的时候，成群的莱亨鸡不断飞到窗棂上，眨着眼睛朝里望，叽叽喳喳地议论着。我问麻振久可不可以给他在鸡舍里照张像，他摸了摸下巴，寻思一下，然后对我郑重地提出条件：“同志，你可得先消消毒，进去的时候贴着篱笆，慢慢地走，别吓着它们。什么也别摸。”
    鸡舍外头有一个装满石灰的木匣子，他很仔细地盯着我把脚在里面踩了几下，才点头放行。仪式的隆重和认真，使我感觉进的简直不是什么鸡舍，而是神圣的庙堂。
    下山的时候，我们又走过一座鸡舍，碰见一个细高个子，脸上还带着不少稚气的小饲养员。他刚喂完鸡，正拿着个空簸箩从鸡舍里走出来。这就是前年入庄的高小毕业生赵国勤。
    这时候，几百只莱亨鸡都挤到长长的食槽两边，伸长着脖子，随吃随从喉咙里喀喀喀地发出满足的声音。
    我们站在鸡舍外头跟他扯开了。
    “养鸡这门学问可深远去啦！”他歪着脑袋很严肃地说，像是有所感触，又像是告诉我小看不得这一行。也难怪，农庄送他到营城子的试验站去学习了七个月呢，饲养、孵化，甚至连解剖都学到了，回来他满以为这回可全懂啦。可是一碰上问题，他时常还得写信给试验站的老师。
    “头天晚上明明还是好好的一只鸡，早晨它不下架了，要不就是晚上上不去架。”说的时候他把眉毛拧到一块儿，好像勾起了什么痛苦的回忆似的。“接着鸡冠子发紫，筋骨也麻木了。一只挺好的鸡，就这么算完事啦。”
    说完这话，他赶快朝鸡舍关切地望了望。有的鸡嘴快，吃饱了已经仰起头来，沿着篱笆很神气地散步，有的还把脑袋埋到槽里捡着残食。
    现在，一般的病赵国勤都能治疗了，有时候他还给鸡动手术。他每个星期都给鸡消毒，隔个时期就喂它们点儿清肠剂。可他就是愁这个“热射病”。今年，他想出个办法，围着篱笆种了一些爬架的葫芦和瓜，准备用这些植物的叶蔓替鸡搭个凉棚。
    分手的时候，我问起他的理想，这个小庄员的神情有点羞涩，可又很坚定地说：“我要做一个鸡的病理学家。”　（待续）
