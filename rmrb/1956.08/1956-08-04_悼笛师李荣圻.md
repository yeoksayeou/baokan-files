    In Memory of Flute Master Li Rongqi
    Zhang Yunhe
    While the whole country was discussing the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Comrade Li Rongqi, one of the music arrangers of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," died of pneumonia in Suzhou on June 28th.
    I remember it was a Beijing morning in May when I ran into Comrade Li Rongqi, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, at the entrance of the Tianqiao Theater. As soon as we met, I felt strange: although he usually had the unkempt demeanor of an old artist, why was he wearing such bulky cotton clothes on such a sunny day in May? When I shook his hand to greet him, his hand felt ice-cold. I couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?" He smiled casually and said, "I guess I'm sick. I'm coughing badly, and the troupe let me rest. I didn't even play the flute for the performance of 'Fifteen Strings of Cash'." Then he hurried away, probably to attend to some task. At the time, I thought the old gentleman was probably too happy and had a little cold and cough from drinking too much wine. I never expected that less than two months later, the bad news would arrive, and I would never hear his flute again.
    The adaptation of the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" was mainly due to Comrade Li Rongqi's creative handling of the music. For example, in the scene where Kuang Zhong investigates You Hulu's house, there is not much singing, but the music expresses the serious, bleak, and depressing atmosphere. The "Sentenced to Death" scene is the turning point of the whole play. When the play reaches this point, it is first filled with grief and tension, making the audience sweat for the wronged; then Kuang Zhong is determined to rescue the two innocent people and overcomes all difficulties with a resolute and calm spirit, which makes people breathe a sigh of relief. These two different atmospheres are appropriately expressed in the music.
    In Jiangnan, every friend who loves Kunqu Opera knows Li Rongqi's flute. He has been playing the flute for forty years and has reached the realm of perfection and supernatural skill. A simple flute, when blown by him, expresses different emotions and different atmospheres. When playing "The Peony Pavilion," it is lingering and graceful; when playing "Sudden Change, Burying Jade," it is sad and mournful; when playing "Night Flight" and "Mountain Gate," it is passionate and慷慨. Once, I heard him play the "Hearing the Bells" section of the Palace of Eternal Life, the first line of the lyrics is "Shishi lingling," and in his flute sound, there seemed to be the sound of "Shishi lingling" rain, wind, and bells. For a time, the audience was silent.
    Kunqu Opera uses the flute as its main instrument. The flute player plays almost from the opening gong to the end, with very little time to rest. Last year, when the Kunsu Opera Troupe performed in Shanghai, I went to see him during the intermission. He was still sitting in the musicians' seat, coaching a young actor on a tune. As far as I know, most of the tunes of the young actors of the Kunsu Opera Troupe were taught by him.
    Like other comrades in the Kunsu Opera Troupe, flute master Li Rongqi was very poor in the old society and lived a life of poverty and hardship. He once lamented: "In the past, when serving the adults and gentlemen to sing, they would give you a seat when they wanted you to play, and 'take away the seat' when they didn't. We really lived a life where we couldn't hold our heads up!"
    Now the Kunsu Opera Troupe has gone through the "winding path" and begun to embark on the "broad road." But Li Rongqi has left his comrades and audiences forever, which makes people deeply miss and mourn this outstanding old artist!

    悼笛师李荣圻
    张允和
    当全国争谈昆剧“十五贯”的时候，“十五贯”的乐曲处理者之一李荣圻同志，在六月二十八日因肺炎不治在苏州去世了。
    记得是北京五月的一个清晨，我在天桥剧场门口碰到久别了的李荣圻同志。一见面，我觉得很奇怪：他平常虽然有着不修边幅的老艺人的风度，但何至于在那样晴和的五月天气里，还穿着一身很臃肿的棉衣裤。我和他握手问好的时候，感觉他的手是冰凉的。我不禁问：“您怎么啦，身体不好？”他漫不在意地笑笑说：“算是病了吧，呛得利害，团里让我休息。‘十五贯’上演，我都没有吹笛子。”说完就匆匆地走了，大概是赶什么任务去。当时我想，老先生准是太高兴了，多喝了酒，不免得了点伤风咳嗽的小毛病。没想到不到两个月，噩耗传来，从此再也听不到他的笛声了。
    昆剧“十五贯”的改编，音乐方面，主要得力于李荣圻同志的创造性的处理。例如，况钟勘查尤葫芦家那一幕，唱白不多，音乐却把严肃、惨淡而又沉闷的气氛表达了出来。“判斩”一幕是全剧的转折点，戏演到这儿，始则悲愤紧张，使观众为受冤者捏一把汗；继而况钟决心营救这两个无辜者，以果敢沉着的精神，战胜了一切困难，又使人深深地透出了一口气。这两种不同的气氛，都在音乐里恰如其分地表现了出来。
    在江南，凡是爱好昆曲的朋友，没有一个不知道李荣圻的笛子的。他吹笛子吹了有四十年，已经到了炉火纯青、出神入化的境界。一支简单的笛子，到他口边一吹，不同的情绪，不同的气氛，一一表现了出来。吹到“游园惊梦”，就是缠绵婀娜；吹到“惊变、埋玉”就是哀怨凄恻；吹到“夜奔”“山门”，就是激昂慷慨。有一次，听到他吹长生殿“闻铃”的一段，唱词的第一句是“淅淅零零”，他的笛声里面，也仿佛有着“淅淅零零”的雨声、风声、夹着铃声。一时满座寂然。
    昆剧以笛子为主要乐器。笛师差不多从开锣吹到散场，很少有休息的时间。去年昆苏剧团在上海演出时候，我在幕间休息的当儿去看他。他仍然坐在奏乐的位子上，正在为一位年青的演员拍曲子。据我所知，昆苏剧团青年演员们的曲子，大半是他教授的。
    和昆苏剧团的其他同志一样，笛师李荣圻在旧社会里很贫困，过着穷愁潦倒的生活。他曾经慨叹地说：“过去服侍大人先生们唱曲子，要你吹的时候赏你一个坐位，不吹的时候就‘撤坐’。真过的是抬不起头来的日子！”
    现在昆苏剧团已经走尽了“崎岖小路”开始踏上“康庄大道”了。而李荣圻却永远离开了他的同道者和观众们，这叫人们怎能不深深怀念和哀悼这位杰出的老艺人呢！
