Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 16th. More than 1,600 handicraft production cooperatives (groups) in Shanghai have signed medical contracts with nearby joint clinics and health stations. If the 110,000 cooperative (group) members encounter general illnesses, they can go to the designated medical institutions for diagnosis and treatment, and the cooperative will bear the medical expenses.
　　These medical expenses are paid by each grassroots cooperative/group, which withdraws 1% to 6% of the total wages of the cooperative/group members from the public accumulation each month. The portion that should be paid by some new cooperatives and groups with less public accumulation or no accumulation will be subsidized by the Shanghai Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation. The Federation and grassroots cooperatives can also provide subsidies according to their economic situation for the expenses required for referral, hospitalization, and purchase of expensive medicines for members with serious illnesses.
