What Do Peasants Need and What Is Their Purchasing Power?

I. Agricultural and Sideline Production and Income Distribution

We conducted a survey of the purchasing power of members of the Dousheng, Hongqi, Mahe, and Heping advanced agricultural cooperatives in Suihua and Ning'an counties, Heilongjiang Province. After organizing into cooperatives, agricultural production in these four cooperatives increased by 10%-15% annually. After transitioning to advanced cooperatives, according to the 1956 plan, if there were no natural disasters, production would increase by about 50% or more.

According to the survey, the income of the cooperative members in all four cooperatives increased, and the income distribution ratio also changed. (1) This year, the dividend for cooperative members is generally between 100 and 150 yuan, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. The proportion of dividends in output value increased from 45%-60% in 1955 to 60%-70%. (2) The cash portion of the cooperative members' dividends increased rapidly, with its proportion rising by 10% compared to in-kind income. (3) The proportion of public accumulation retained by the cooperatives increased by 4%. (4) All income is distributed according to workdays, and changes have occurred between classes. The income of poor and lower-middle peasants, who originally had little land, lacked means of production, but had more labor, increased rapidly. The income of relatively well-off middle peasants, who originally had more land, sufficient means of production, and less labor, also increased, but not as much as the former. The purchasing power of the rural areas has generally increased. Taking the Dousheng Cooperative's income distribution plan for this year as an example, each cooperative member received a dividend of 130.2 yuan, an increase of 40.9% compared to last year.

II. Income Distribution Time and Purchasing Power Realization Season

The harvest time for crops in the Heilongjiang region is relatively late. Wheat is threshed in early August, rice is harvested in mid-September, and other field crops are mostly threshed successively in November. Before the establishment of the cooperatives, the surplus grain was sold to the state by the farmers themselves, which took a long time. In the autumn of 1955, since most farmers joined the cooperatives, measures such as simultaneous harvesting, threshing, selling, and distributing, as well as unified sales and scheduled pre-distribution, were implemented, which significantly shortened the time. Wheat was sold from mid-August to the end of the month, accounting for about 20% of the total grain sales; rice and soybeans were sold from early October to mid-November, accounting for 57%; and other miscellaneous grains were mostly sold before mid-December, accounting for 23%.

The dividend for cooperative members is distributed in advance, generally in three installments: the wheat harvest pre-distribution is in September, accounting for 7.5-10% of the cooperative members' total income, with cash accounting for two-thirds. The main harvest pre-distribution is from mid-November to early December, accounting for 55%-60%, with cash accounting for only 10%, mainly to solve the problem of the whole year's food rations and firewood. The year-end settlement is at the end of December or dragged into January of the following year, accounting for 30%-37.5%; all in cash.

From the current point of view, the peak season for the realization of purchasing power is still the first and fourth quarters, while the second and third quarters are smaller and quieter. It is worth noting that due to the development of sideline production, the first and second halves of the year are gradually leveling out, and the quietness of the second and third quarters has eased. For example, the supply of consumer goods in the Mahe Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative accounted for 45% in the first half of 1954 and 55% in the second half, while in 1955, the first and second halves each accounted for 50%.

III. Farmers' Demand for Commodities

The basic characteristics of the rural market after this autumn will be an earlier peak, a longer duration, and comprehensive activity. Preliminary estimates: After the autumn harvest, in addition to the collective expenditure of the cooperatives, the per capita purchasing power of consumer goods for cooperative members is as follows: The total income of each cooperative member of the Dousheng Cooperative is 140.2 yuan, of which 130.2 yuan is from dividends and 10 yuan is from household sideline income; the total cash income is 87.1 yuan. Commodity expenditure is 72.1 yuan, of which 39.6 yuan is realized this year, accounting for 55% of commodity expenditure. The total income of cooperative members of the Hongqi Cooperative is 139.7 yuan, of which 134.7 yuan is from dividends and 5 yuan is from household sideline income; the total cash income is 121.7 yuan, commodity expenditure is 101.7 yuan, of which 61 yuan is realized this year, accounting for 60% of commodity expenditure. The situation in the Mahe and Heping cooperatives is similar to that of the above two cooperatives.

From the survey, we learned about farmers' requirements for production and consumer goods as follows:

Requirements for production materials:

In terms of production materials, in addition to needing sporadic small farm tools such as hoe blades and hoe hooks, farmers have discovered the following new problems: (1) They are particularly interested in power machines. Each cooperative generally plans to buy 10-15 horsepower gas engines or portable steam engines and electric grinders after the autumn harvest. They believe that using these things saves labor and produces more work. Preparing to convert to paddy field crops, they will purchase a large number of paddy field farm tools after the autumn harvest, such as seeders, cultivators, and weeders. (2) There is a great enthusiasm for buying cars. They said that the cooperatives are larger, and the harvesting and sale of grain are highly centralized, so time is of the essence. Carts are labor-intensive, material-intensive, and time-consuming. Cars can carry more, run faster, and are more efficient. Each cooperative plans to buy one for use after the autumn harvest at the latest, no later than the autumn harvest of 1957. (3) The need for fertilizers and pesticides is very urgent, and they demand that the supply of soda (for soaking rice seeds), ammonium sulfate, oil cake, and 666 powder be resolved.

Requirements for major commodities in consumer goods:

(1) Food: Food rations are sufficient and surplus, and cooperative members solve the problem of pork and vegetables themselves; the supply of vegetable oil is tight, and seasonings, dried vegetables, vermicelli, fruits, pastries, etc., can be fully supplied during festivals. Sugar sales are not large, averaging about two kilograms per household per year. Wealthy households with many children need five kilograms a year; farmers generally smoke and drink alcohol, but only 20% smoke cigarettes. White wine sales are large, averaging one kilogram per household per month on ordinary days and three kilograms in winter.

(2) Clothing: 35 chi of cloth per person is considered too little by farmers, so they want high-quality, durable gabardine, double-strand twill, khaki, and corduroy, and require novel and beautiful colors that do not fade. With the increase of women working in the fields, the need for clothing has also increased. The demand for Western-style trousers and reversible trousers is increasing, and some people want sweaters and good thermal underwear; shoes and hats are not only needed in large quantities but also in high quality, and it is very common to wear sneakers. Women want elegant Kun shoes, not gender-neutral ones; paddy field areas need high-barrel rubber boots, and some people buy leather shoes and leather hats and want good fox fur and raccoon fur, while mink fur is not popular; socks average two pairs per person per year, lacking plain-colored long socks, and towels are needed in large quantities, mostly used by women to wrap their heads, averaging three per household.

(3) Utensils: The increase in cultural and hygiene products is large, and the supply of medicines should consider seasonality. More painkillers and aspirin are needed in the spring; Ren Dan and first-aid water are needed in the summer. High-end daily necessities have also been proposed, and some people have already bought sewing machines, bicycles, thermos bottles, and mantel clocks, and some people want to buy them after the autumn harvest.

(4) Other aspects: There is a shortage of firewood. Some wealthy households welcome coal to the countryside for heating. Currently, about 30% of households lack firewood. The Hongqi Cooperative has registered for 40 tons of coal and needs about 70 to 100 tons for the whole year. The demand for building materials is not very large this autumn due to the ongoing merger of villages and construction of new villages, but it is estimated that it will be needed more next year.

In addition, in the past, farmers mostly cut their own hair and made their own clothes, but now they mostly go to the barbershops and clothing stores run by the cooperatives. According to a survey of typical households, the average non-commodity expenditure per person in 1955 was 1.5 yuan, and it will reach 2 yuan in 1956. The average subscription to public bonds per person has also increased.

IV. Trade Form Issues

Natural villages are scattered, there are few private merchants, there are not many peddlers going to villages and households, there is no primary market, and the supply of goods mainly depends on the supply and marketing cooperatives. This is the characteristic of the rural trade form in Heilongjiang Province. This requires village supply and marketing cooperatives to conduct in-depth surveys of changes in farmers' needs, actively organize supplies, and purchase agricultural products and waste materials. According to the scattered situation of natural villages, township supply and marketing cooperatives should organize personnel to deliver goods to the door during the busy farming season and sell them from village to village.

Some unreasonable phenomena were found in the survey: The province uniformly merged cooperatives, abolished the independent accounting system of the original grassroots cooperatives, and changed them into distribution stores belonging to the township general cooperatives. All profits are turned over to the higher level, and the goods are uniformly allocated by the general cooperative. Therefore, the grassroots cooperatives are not active in management, do not take the initiative to purchase goods, and are not enthusiastic about selling goods, waiting for customers to come to their door. Another phenomenon is that they are not active in carrying out the waste product recovery business, believing that the odds and ends are troublesome, difficult to store, and earn little money, which affects the lives of farmers in the off-season. In view of these situations, village supply and marketing cooperatives should restore the independent accounting system or the bonus system to encourage their management enthusiasm.

    农民需要什么，有多大购买力？
    一、农副业生产和收益分配
    我们在黑龙江绥化、宁安两县的斗胜、红旗、马河、和平四个高级社对社员购买力的情况作了个调查。这四个社农民组织起来后，历年农业增产在10％—15％之间，转为高级社后，按1956年的规划，如果没有灾害，增产约在50％以上。
    根据调查，四个社社员的收入都增加了，收益分配比例也发生了变化。（1）今年社员分红一般在一百——一百五十元之间，比去年增长30％以上，分红占产值比重由1955年的45％—60％提高到60％—70％。（2）社员分红中现金部分增长很快，与实物收益相比，比重上升10％。（3）社留公共积累的比重上升4％。（4）全部收益按劳动日分配，阶层间发生了变化，原来土地少、生产资料缺而劳动力较多的贫农和下中农的收入上升快，而原来土地多、生产资料足、劳动力较少的富裕中农，收入虽亦有增长，但不如前者。农村购买力普遍提高了。以斗胜社今年收益分配规划为例，每个社员分红130.2元，比去年增加了40.9％。
    二、收益分配时间和购买力实现季节
    黑龙江地区农作物的收获时间较晚，小麦在八月上旬打完场，水稻在九月中旬收割，其它大田作物多在十一月份内才能陆续打完。建社以前，余粮由农民自己卖给国家，时间拖的很长。1955年秋，由于大部分农民入了社，实行了边收、边打、边卖、边分的措施和统一出售、按期预分的办法，时间提前很多；小麦从八月半卖到月末，约占粮食总出售量的20％；水稻、大豆在十月初到十一月半卖完，占57％；其它杂粮多在十二月中旬前出卖，占23％。
    社员分红采取预分方式，一般是三次：麦秋预分在九月份，占社员全部收入的7.5—10％，内现金占三分之二。大秋预分在十一月中到十二月初，占55％—60％，现金只占10％，主要是解决全年口粮、柴草问题。年终结算在十二月末或拖到下年度一月份，占30％—37.5％；全是现金。
    购买力的实现时间，从目前来看，仍是四、一季度大，旺；三、二季度小、淡；值得注意的是由于副业生产的发展，上、下半年逐渐拉平，二、三季度淡的程度已经转缓，如马河村供销社生活资料供应额1954年上半年占45％，下半年占55％，1955年上、下半年各占50％。
    三、农民对商品需要情况
    旺的早，旺的长，全面活跃，将是今年秋后农村市场的基本特点。初步估算：秋后除社里集体开支以外，社员个人每人生活资料购买力如下：斗胜社每个社员总收入一百四十元二角，其中分红所得一百三十元二角，家庭副业收入十元；总收入中现金共八十七元一角。商品支出七十二元一角，其中在今年实现的三十九元六角，占商品支出55％。红旗社社员总收入一百三十九元七角，其中分红所得一百三十四元七角，家庭副业收入五元；总收入中现金共一百二十一元七角，商品支出一百零一元七角，其中在今年实现的六十一元，占商品支出60％。马河、和平两社情况和上两社类似。
    从调查中了解到农民对生产、生活资料的要求如下：
    对生产资料的要求：
    生产资料中农民除需要锄板、锄勾等零星小农具外，发现以下几个新问题：（1）对动力机器特别感兴趣，各社普遍计划秋后买10—15匹马力的瓦斯机或锅驼机、电磨，他们认为用这些东西省工、出活。预备改水田作物区，秋后要购置大量水田农具，如播种机，铲趟机、锄草机。（2）要求买汽车的劲头很大，他们说，社大了，粮食收割出售都高度集中，时间要求急，大车费工费料又费时，汽车装的多，跑的快，效率高。各社都计划秋后最晚不超过1957年秋收，买一辆使用。（3）对肥料、农药需要非常迫切，要求给解决小苏打（浸稻种用）、硫安、油饼、六六六粉的货源。
    生活资料中对主要商品的需要情况：
    （1）吃的方面：口粮够吃而有余，猪肉蔬菜社员自己解决；植物油供应紧张，调味料、干菜、粉条、水果、糕点等，能在节日充分供应即可，食糖销量不大，每户全年平均二斤左右，富裕户、小孩多的一年需要五斤；农民吸烟、喝酒普遍，但吸卷烟的只占20％。白酒销量大，平常日子每户每月一斤，冬天三斤。
    （2）穿的方面：每人35尺布，农民嫌少，因而尽要质量好、耐穿的华达呢、双线斜纹、卡其、趟绒，要求花色新颖美观，不退色；随着妇女下地的增多，服装的需要也增多。西式裤、两面可换穿的裤子需要量增大，部分人要毛衣、好秋衣等；鞋帽不仅数量要的多而且质量要高，穿球鞋的很普遍。妇女要求坤鞋秀气点，不要男女不分；水田区要高统胶靴，部分人买皮鞋、皮帽子要好狐狸毛、狢绒的，川鼠的不受欢迎；袜子每人每年平均两双，缺长统素色的，毛巾要得很多，妇女多用来包头，每户平均要三条。
    （3）用的方面：文化卫生用品增加大，药品供应要考虑季节性。春天止痛片、阿斯匹林要的多；夏天要仁丹、救急水等。高级日用品也有人提出来，并且已经有人买了缝纫机、自行车、暖水瓶和座钟，秋后还有人要买。
    （4）其它方面：烧材不足，部分富裕户取暖欢迎煤炭下乡，目前约有30％的农户烧柴不足，红旗社已登记要四十吨煤，全年约需七十吨到一百吨；建筑材料类商品今秋由于正在并屯建庄，需要量并不太大，估计明年会需要得多。
    另外，过去农民大多是自己剃头、自己做衣服，现在多到社里办的理发室去理发，到成衣铺做衣服。根据典型户调查，1955年平均每人非商品开支1.5元，1956年将达2元。每人平均认购公债也有提高。
      四、贸易形式问题
    自然屯分散，私商少，走屯串户小贩不多，无初级市场，商品供应主要靠供销社负责。这是黑龙江省农村贸易形式的特点。这就要求村供销社深入调查农民需要的变化，积极组织供应，并收购农产品和废杂品。根据自然屯分散情况，乡供销社应该组织人员在农忙季节送货上门，串屯卖买。
    从调查中发现一些不合理的现象：全省统一并社，把原基层社的独立核算制取消，改成属于乡总社的分销店，利润全部上交，进货统一由总社拨给，因此基层社经营不积极，进货不主动，销货不起劲，等客上门。另一现象就是对废品收回业务开展不积极，认为零星麻烦，不好保管，赚钱少，这样就影响淡季农民生活。根据这些情况，村供销社应恢复独立核算制，或奖励制，以鼓励他们的经营积极性。（据商业部黑龙江农村调查材料编）
