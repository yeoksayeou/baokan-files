    Radford's Trip to the Far East
    Li Gao

    Less than a month after U.S. Vice President Nixon's activities in the Far East, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford made a big circle in the Far East again. He has been to the Philippines, Indochina, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and other places, and is now on his way back home.

    In various parts of the Far East, Radford held many meetings and made many speeches as usual. But on the whole, he mainly did two things this time. One is to redeploy the U.S. troops stationed in the Far East and the Pacific region; the other is to exert pressure and cheer on the U.S.'s so-called "allies," asking them to continue to serve the U.S.'s aggressive policies according to the U.S.'s new deployment.

    Regarding the redeployment of U.S. troops, the U.S. Department of Defense announced a plan to reorganize the U.S. military command in the Far East and the Pacific region a few days before Radford set off to the Far East. According to this plan, the U.S. is scheduled to abolish the current "U.S. Far East Command" located in Japan from July 1st next year, and transfer all U.S. troops stationed in the Far East and the Pacific region to the "Pacific Command" located in Hawaii for unified command, in order to simplify the organization, concentrate command power, and "concentrate stronger forces in the crisis location during emergencies," and increase the "efficiency" and "flexibility" of intimidating and aggressive activities in the Far East. Another intention of the United States in doing so is to try to ease the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people in this way. This is the same motive as the U.S. agreeing to hold negotiations with the Philippines on U.S. military bases in the Philippines. However, the purpose of the United States in easing the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese and Philippine people is to paralyze the Japanese and Philippine people, so that the United States can further incorporate Japan and the Philippines into its strategic plans. To this end, Radford personally made arrangements in Hawaii, Japan, and other places where U.S. troops are stationed. Along the way, Radford was afraid that others would not understand the threatening nature of the U.S. plan to peace in the Far East, so he repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. reorganization plan does not mean weakening the U.S. combat forces in the Far East.

    For the U.S.'s so-called "allies," Radford adopted the old tactics of threats and inducements. He exerted pressure on the Philippines, Japan, and other countries to firmly control the main military bases located on their territories, and expanded these bases according to the requirements of conducting atomic warfare. At the same time, he used increased "military assistance" as a means to instruct the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques to step up their conspiracies to undermine peace in the Far East, and urged Japan and Southeast Asian group countries to step up their arms expansion.

    In order to achieve these goals, Radford inspected the various "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Groups" stationed in various parts of the Far East, and held separate talks with local military and political authorities. While in the Philippines, Radford openly emphasized that "the Republic of the Philippines is an important part of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," in order to show that the Philippines must assume the military obligations of continuing to follow the United States. At the same time, he announced that the United States will give the Philippines 30 jet aircraft next year in order to drive the Philippines to accelerate its arms expansion. More ironically, the Philippine people are currently resolutely opposing the U.S. occupation of military bases in the Philippines, and the U.S. has to agree to hold negotiations with the Philippines to amend the U.S.-Philippines military base agreement. However, Radford ran to the Philippines to personally preside over the opening ceremony of the Cubi Point Naval Air Station of the Sangley U.S. Naval Base—a huge air station with equipment that can load and transport hydrogen bombs. The U.S. Navy also openly stated that it would spend hundreds of millions of dollars more to build new combat equipment on the bases in the Philippines. This is tantamount to saying that despite the Philippines' opposition, despite the U.S.-Philippines negotiations, the United States still wants to occupy and build more military bases on the territory of the Philippines.

    In order to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and exacerbate the tense situation in the Taiwan region, Radford held three days of talks with the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, indicating that the United States will continue to equip the Chiang Kai-shek army according to a huge military assistance plan. It is revealed that these talks focused on discussing the U.S. strengthening the Chiang Kai-shek group's air force and navy in order to instruct it to conduct harassment activities on the Chinese mainland. Radford also openly said that the purpose of the United States is to enable the Chiang Kai-shek group "to obtain the equipment they need and be able to take effective military actions."

    In South Vietnam, Radford openly encouraged the Ngo Dinh Diem group to continue to refuse to fulfill the Geneva Accords. Radford claimed that the United States "will not abandon" South Vietnam, and at the same time stated that the United States will continue to undermine the provisions of the Geneva Accords that prohibit the import of foreign combat materials into Indochina, and "not reduce" U.S. "military assistance" to this region. In Seoul, Radford shouted to "revise" the Korean Armistice Agreement so that the United States could transport "new weapons" and even atomic weapons to South Korea. Prior to this, the United States had announced that it would move the so-called "United Nations Command" from Japan to South Korea to support the Syngman Rhee group's more arrogant wrongdoing.

    In Japan, Radford once again blatantly interfered in Japan's internal affairs, openly claiming that he opposed Japan's plan to slowly increase ground troops, and insisted that Japan further expand its armed forces. He also stated that the United States "encourages" Japan to study and manufacture new weapons, and wants to "help" Japan establish a so-called "balanced" force. More noteworthy is that Radford revealed that the United States will use the cancellation of the U.S. military "Far East Command" in Japan as an excuse to establish a new command in Japan to command Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" and strengthen the so-called U.S.-Japan "joint defense" organization, in order to further put Japan's armed forces under U.S. control.

    Radford's activities prove that the new U.S. military deployment in the Far East is actually still the old conspiracy of so-called "using Asians to fight Asians," and is still a policy of preparing for war based on the so-called "three fronts." This shows that at a time when the current world situation continues to ease, the U.S.'s aggressive plans and "Cold War" policy in the Far East are still unwilling to relax. However, today the strength of the people of various countries in the Far East who demand to maintain peace has become so strong that it cannot be stopped by U.S. military deployments and anti-communist clamoring. If the likes of Radford do not recognize this, even if they run their legs off and shout until their throats are hoarse, it will be of no avail.

    雷德福的远东之行
    李高
    继美国副总统尼克松在远东活动之后不到一个月，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福又到远东兜了一个大圈子。他已经到过了菲律宾、印度支那、泰国、台湾、南朝鲜、日本等地，现在正在回国途中。
    雷德福在远东各地，照例开了许多会，讲了许多话，但总的来看，他这次主要的是做两件事。一件是重新部署美国驻在远东和太平洋地区的军队；一件是向美国的所谓“盟国”施加压力和打气，要它们根据美国的新部署，继续为美国的侵略政策服务。
    在重新部署美国军队方面，美国国防部在雷德福动身到远东来的前几天，曾宣布了一个改组美国驻在远东和太平洋地区的军事司令部的计划。根据这个计划，美国预定从明年七月一日起，把目前设在日本的“美国远东军司令部”撤销，将驻在远东和太平洋地区的全部美国军队划归设在夏威夷的“太平洋司令部”统一指挥，以便简化机构，集中指挥权力，“能够在紧急时期把较强大的部队集中在发生危机的地点”，增加对远东进行恫吓和侵略活动的“效率”和“灵活性”。美国之所以这样做，还有一个打算就是企图这样来和缓日本人民的反美情绪。这同美国同意同菲律宾举行关于美国在菲军事基地的谈判，出于同样的动机。但是美国缓和日本和菲律宾人民的反美情绪，其目的却是为了麻痹日本和菲律宾人民，使美国可以更进一步地把日本和菲律宾纳入美国的战略计划里面去。为此，雷德福先后到夏威夷、日本和其他驻有美国军队的地方亲自进行了一番布置。一路上，雷德福还唯恐别人不清楚美国这个计划对远东和平的威胁性，因而再三地强调，美国这个改组计划，绝不意味着削弱美国在远东的战斗力量。
    对于美国的所谓“盟国”，雷德福采取了威胁和利诱的老手法。他对菲律宾、日本等国施加压力，牢牢地控制设在它们的领土上的主要军事基地，并且根据进行原子战争的要求来扩大这些基地。同时，他以增加“军事援助”为手段，指使蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳集团加紧进行破坏远东和平的阴谋活动，督促日本和东南亚集团国家加紧扩军。
    为了达到这些目的，雷德福视察了驻在远东各地的各个“美国军事援助顾问团”，并且同当地的军政当局分别举行了会谈。在菲律宾的时候，雷德福公开地强调说：“菲律宾共和国是东南亚条约组织的一个重要组成部分”，借以表明菲律宾必须承担继续追随美国的军事义务。同时他又宣布美国将在明年给予菲律宾三十架喷气机，以驱使菲律宾加速扩军。更有讽刺意义的是，目前菲律宾人民正在坚决反对美国在菲律宾占有军事基地，美国也不得不答应同菲律宾举行修改美菲军事基地协定的谈判，可是雷德福却跑到菲律宾亲自主持了桑莱美国海军基地的库比岬海军航空站——一个设有可以装运氢弹的设备的巨大航空站——的开幕典礼。美国海军还公开说要再花成亿的美元在菲律宾的基地上修建新的作战设备。这无异说，尽管菲律宾反对，尽管有美菲谈判，可是美国在菲律宾的领土上却还是要占有和修建更多的军事基地。
    为了阻挠中国人民解放台湾和加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，雷德福在台湾曾和蒋介石集团举行了三天的会谈，表示美国将继续根据一项庞大的军事援助计划装备蒋介石军队。据透露，这些会谈着重在讨论美国加强蒋介石集团的空军和海军方面，以便指使它进行骚扰中国大陆的活动。雷德福也公开说：美国的目的是要使蒋介石集团“能够得到他们所需要的装备，并且能够采取有效的军事行动”。
    在南越，雷德福公开鼓励吴庭艳集团继续拒绝履行日内瓦协议。雷德福声称美国“不会遗弃”南越，同时表示美国将要继续破坏日内瓦协议中关于禁止向印度支那运入外国作战物资的规定，“不削减”美国对这个地区的“军事援助”。在汉城，雷德福叫喊要“修改”朝鲜停战协定，以便美国向南朝鲜运入“新式武器”甚至原子武器。在此以前，美国曾宣布要把所谓“联合国军司令部”从日本移到南朝鲜，以支持李承晚集团更狂妄地胡作非为。
    雷德福在日本又一次露骨地干涉日本的内政，公开声称他反对日本打算慢慢地增加地面部队的计划，硬要日本进一步扩充它的武装部队。他还表示，美国“鼓励”日本研究制造新武器，并且要“帮助”日本建立所谓“均衡的”部队。更值得注意的是，雷德福透露，美国将以撤销在日本的美军“远东司令部”为借口，在日本建立一个新的司令部来指挥日本的“自卫队”和加强所谓日美“联防”组织，以便进一步地把日本的武装部队置于美国控制之下。
    雷德福的这些活动证明，美国目前在远东的新的军事部署，实际上仍然是所谓“以亚洲人打亚洲人”的老阴谋，仍然是以所谓“三条战线”为基础的准备战争的政策。这说明了在当前世界局势继续趋向缓和的时候，美国在远东方面的侵略计划和“冷战”政策是仍然不肯放松的。但是，今天远东各国人民要求维护和平的力量，已强大到绝不是美国的军事部署和反共叫嚣所能阻挡的程度了。雷德福之流如果不认识这一点，他们即使跑断两腿、喊破喉咙，也是无济于事的。
