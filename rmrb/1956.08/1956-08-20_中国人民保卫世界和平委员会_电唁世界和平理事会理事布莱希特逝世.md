    Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
    Sends Condolences on the Death of World Peace Council Member Brecht

    Xinhua News Agency, 19th - The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace sent a telegram on the 18th to Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Council, to express condolences on the death of German writer and World Peace Council member Bertolt Brecht.

    The telegram stated: Mr. Brecht dedicated his life to opposing war and striving for lasting world peace in his cultural and artistic work. His death is not only a loss to German and world culture and art but also a loss to the cause of defending world peace. However, we firmly believe that Mr. Brecht's spirit of fighting for the progressive cause of mankind will continue to inspire peace-loving German people and people of the world to unremittingly strive to strengthen friendship between the people of all countries and to achieve lasting world peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin - Renowned German playwright and poet, and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, Bertolt Brecht, passed away in Berlin on the evening of August 14th due to a heart condition, at the age of fifty-eight.

    Brecht was not only an outstanding playwright and poet but also a staunch fighter against militarism and the forces of war. During Hitler's rule in Germany, he resided successively in Denmark, the Soviet Union, Sweden, Finland, and the United States. After returning to his homeland from the United States in 1947, he actively participated in the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and always stood at the forefront of the German people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. His works have a wide readership. His famous representative works include "The Exception and the Rule", "Fear and Misery of the Third Reich", "The Caucasian Chalk Circle", and "Mother Courage and Her Children".
