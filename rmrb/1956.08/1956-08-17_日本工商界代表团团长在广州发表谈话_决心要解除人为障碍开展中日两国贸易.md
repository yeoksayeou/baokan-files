Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 16th: Mr. Itoh Kemazō, head of the Japanese business delegation to China, left Guangzhou today to return to his country. Before leaving Guangzhou, he spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about his impressions of his visit to China.

Itoh Kemazō said that a considerable number of people in Japan do not understand the socialist system and believe that socialism is a dictatorial system. However, when they come to China, they see that this is not the case. The Chinese government is taking every opportunity to widely explain government policies and specific plans to the people. People's representatives and opinion boxes everywhere solicit the opinions of the people. The government concentrates these opinions to improve the country's political life and production activities. Therefore, he believes that China is democratic.

Itoh Kemazō talked about the construction that China is undertaking. He is convinced that if the Chinese people continue to build in this way, China's industrial construction will achieve great achievements in a few years. He also said that China and Japan are only separated by a strip of water, and that improving the living standards of the Chinese people is beneficial to Japan. There is great potential for the development of Sino-Japanese trade.

In his speech, Itoh Kemazō expressed great dissatisfaction with the U.S. embargo policy. He said, "When I go back, I must tell the Japanese people the actual situation in China and organize the people to remove those artificial obstacles. We can also follow the example of countries such as Britain and France and use exception procedures to export more goods to China."

Itoh Kemazō said that he was very satisfied with the transactions he made in China this time. Transactions in Beijing alone amounted to four million pounds, and only preliminary discussions were held in Shanghai and Tianjin. The amount of future transactions will be even greater.

When the topic turned to current major international issues, he expressed his support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. He believes that this is an inevitable trend in the world and an inevitable requirement of the national independence movement.

    日本工商界代表团团长在广州发表谈话
    决心要解除人为障碍开展中日两国贸易
    据新华社广州16日电　日本工商界访华代表团团长伊藤今朝市今天离开广州回国。他在离开广州前向新华社记者畅谈他的访华观感。
    伊藤今朝市说，日本有相当一部分人士不了解社会主义制度，认为社会主义是一种独裁制度。可是他们来中国一看，并不是这样。中国政府在利用一切机会广泛地向人民解释政府政策和具体计划，人民代表和到处都设置着的意见箱征求着人民的意见。政府把这些意见集中起来，改进国家的政治生活和生产活动。因此，他认为中国是民主的。
    伊藤今朝市谈到了中国正在进行的建设。他确信中国人民这样建设下去不出几年，中国的工业建设将会有很大的成就。他还说，中日两国只隔一带之水，中国人民生活水平的提高对日本是有益的。中日贸易有很大的发展前途。
    伊藤今朝市在谈话中对美国的禁运政策表示极大的不满。他说：“我回去一定要把中国的实际情况告诉日本人民，组织人民来解除那些人为的障碍。我们还可以效法英、法等国，利用例外程序向中国输出更多的货物。”
    伊藤今朝市说，这次在中国进行的交易使他感到十分满意。仅在北京就成交了四百万英镑，在上海、天津只进行了初步的商谈，今后继续成交的金额还会更多。
    当话题转到当前国际重大问题的时候，他表示支持埃及将苏彝士运河公司收归国有的行动。他认为这是世界必然的趋势和是民族独立运动的必然要求。
