V. A Simple Confession

The farm's office starts work every morning at six o'clock. Around five forty-five, a man in his fifties, wearing a neat dark uniform, always pushes a brand-new bicycle up from the foot of the mountain. New bicycles aren't unusual on the farm, and dressing neatly is also quite common, but this man seemed somewhat different from the others in his demeanor. How should I put it? He was at least more refined. Upon asking, I learned that he used to be a capitalist and joined during last year's "high tide."

"Quite active," Chairman Ma affirmed, which piqued my curiosity. Just how active was he? And why was he so active? Let's let this middle-aged, middle-sized farmer named Zhang Bingzhong, who likes to furrow his thick, dark eyebrows, has a modest and amiable attitude, and speaks slowly and quietly, tell us himself.

"Yes, half a year ago, this chairman's office and the surrounding two thousand or so fruit trees were my private property. Since the establishment of the Friendship Orchard Collective Farm, I've requested to join it. After the publication of Chairman Mao's report on the agricultural cooperation movement in October last year, my wish was finally realized. As for food and clothing, I've never worried about that, but I've never felt so happy in my entire life as I do today. Every morning, I get up at four o'clock and ride my bike from Jin County to here, a round trip of thirty li, but I don't feel tired at all. I just feel that these fifty-plus years haven't been in vain, that someone like me has actually participated in socialist construction, and I feel indescribably happy and honored.

"There are five brothers in my family, and I'm the youngest. My brother and I ran a department store in Jin County for many years. The storefront wasn't small, but the 'little noses' (Japanese) controlled the supply of goods, and this wasn't allowed in, that wasn't allowed in, and doing business was constantly at the mercy of the 'corporation.' More than thirty years ago, my brothers and I watched as our business became narrower and narrower, so we took out four thousand yuan from the capital and bought this barren mountain. We thought to ourselves that this time, switching from commerce to agriculture, we'd have our own source of goods and wouldn't be bullied anymore. So, we ordered saplings, hired workers, and re-established our family business.

"Who knew that there were 'corporations' in the city, and there were also 'corporations' in the countryside. The apples we grew all had to be sold to them. They divided the apples into three grades, 'Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity,' and set the prices and grades as they pleased, which angered many fruit growers to the point of chopping down their trees. It takes ten years for a tree to bear fruit, and anyone with a little bit of means wouldn't have the heart to chop it down! My brothers and I gritted our teeth and didn't chop them down. But the 'little noses' squeezed us hard.

"I'm telling you, from the day of liberation, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights, and that's not a lie. It wasn't enough that the 'little noses' had almost scraped clean our ancestral property, but even more unbearable was the life of a subjugated slave. Those who haven't been 'Manchukuo subjects' won't understand that feeling. Anyway, I became Chinese again, so how could I not be happy from the bottom of my heart? In the past, my brothers and I were trampled under the feet of the 'little noses,' but after liberation, my brother became the manager of the local trade company and the director of the Jin County Federation of Industry and Commerce, and I became a county people's representative in 1950. My brothers and I have always felt the trust and importance that the Communist Party and the People's Government place in us, and we believe that we also have a responsibility in building socialism.

"Before joining the farm, I was naturally happy to think that I would no longer be a capitalist living off the exploitation of others. But I was still worried about one thing: it's certainly honorable to be a farmer, but farmers have to work. With my pampered body and being over fifty years old, could I do physical labor? After the expansion of the farm in January this year, the farm held new elections. I was not only elected as a farmer representative (out of a total of two hundred), but also at the farmer representative conference, Chairman Ma announced the list of all eleven full-time cadres of the farm (including the three chairmen), and my name was also on it, as the only technician in the office, which I really didn't expect. After the meeting, Chairman Ma said to me: Your health is a bit poor, you don't necessarily have to do physical labor, you should still study the technology more and exert some strength in business management.

"At first, I thought the farm was just taking care of me and didn't seriously expect me to manage anything. But the first task the chairman gave me was to help the accountant sort out the accounts. The accounts are the foundation of the entire farm! Sometimes the three chairmen would go to various production teams to inspect work, and they would ask me to go with them. When the production team leaders saw me, they would definitely ask for my opinion on their work. I thought to myself, that's not right, I'm not only a farmer representative, but also a responsible cadre of the farm, and I have to show the spirit of ownership.

"In May this year, I discovered that the third team at the bottom of the hill had three mu of pasture that hadn't been plowed. If the land isn't plowed, the grass won't grow well. I reported this to the chairman. The chairman told me to talk to them directly. I went to the third team's team headquarters, but the captain wasn't there. I found the deputy captain and explained the situation, and he said okay, let's get started right away. When I ran into the captain in the office in the afternoon, I mentioned it to him, and he said that they had already started plowing.

"When the farmer representative conference was held in April this year, Chairman Ma said at the meeting that after the expansion of the farm, a large sum of money was needed, and called on the farmers to invest as much as possible. During the group discussions, I expressed that in addition to these fruit trees, I also had six thousand yuan deposited in the credit cooperative, and I was willing to take it all out to invest. After the meeting, I rushed to Dalian overnight to find my sister-in-law, my married daughter, and my sister, and mobilized them to put their savings into the farm together to support the expansion work. By piecing it together like this, I raised a total of thirteen thousand yuan. The chairman said some words of encouragement to me, and told me that the money would still earn interest and could be withdrawn at any time.

"I'm just privately expressing to you: I also have a cold storage in Jin County, which was built in the past to deal with the 'corporation.' If the farm needs it, I'd also like to invest it. Anyway, there's only my old partner and me left at home. My daughter teaches elementary school in Dalian, and my son-in-law is a lecturer at the Dalian Medical College, and they are both members of the Communist Youth League.

"What I'm doing is right. Those thousands of yuan in savings were all earned after liberation—that is, given by the people! Only the Communist Party came and stopped bullying fruit growers, and also gave us technical guidance, issued credit loans, and asked the supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase apples at reasonable prices, and that's how business got better. Before, the 'little noses' lowered the price, and I put the collected apples in the warehouse in a fit of pique, preferring to let them rot rather than sell them. After liberation, that warehouse hasn't been used once. Our apples not only cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, but also go to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and are exchanged for machines.

"I have one thought—I think every Chinese has this thought: that is, to build a socialist society as soon as possible, so that everyone can have a good life."

VI. A Farewell Pilgrimage

It's been three days since I got here, and no matter where I go, up or down the slope, I always hear a loud singing voice, and a heavy sound of pounding the ground, as if keeping time with the singing. The farm is building a reservoir, which is a great undertaking after the expansion of the farm. Before leaving the farm, I must go and make a pilgrimage.

Along the way, we saw many kinds of sideline businesses that the farm was engaged in. Snowy white vermicelli hung in clusters of lush green cherry trees. The blacksmith's furnace was puffing and pulling the bellows, and when the anvil fell, ten thousand sparks burst out. The farm implements used by the farmers, the parts of the carts, and the iron for the shoes of a hundred or so mules and horses were all made here.

A farmer in the second team, who was responsible for raising rabbits, was letting out sixty or so rabbits from the iron cages to bask in the sun. He pointed to those long-eared, short-nosed animals and said: Don't look at them being small, they are very useful. Their fur can be used to sew gloves for the farmers, their meat tastes better than white chicken, and their blood can be used to make vaccines to inject into cattle. The farm is interested in engaging in all kinds of sideline businesses. This year, the number of beehives will be greatly increased, and foxes and weasels are also being raised on a trial basis.

The sound of the tamping song rose and fell, becoming louder and louder. Long rows of soil carriers appeared on the hillside, their shoulder poles trembling and creaking, sounding like the chirping of autumn insects from afar. In the narrow valley between the two mountains, a dam had already been laid across the waist. Three rammers, each surrounded by five or six young men with arms as hard as clubs. They lifted the heavy rammer into the air and then slammed it hard on the ground. The three rammer singers tamped while improvising rhyming words, singing a sentence, and everyone following a sentence.

Hey, the reservoir must be built well,
The ramming must be firm,
Hey, we must do socialist things,
Everyone work hard,
The tamping song praised the soil carrying team, and criticized "Second Ram Facing the Sky." This blackboard newspaper, sung out loud, was a sharp and powerful propaganda weapon that reflected the scene and promoted labor.

I stood blankly on the earthen mound, completely attracted by the moving tamping song. On the blueprint, this will be the farm's future power station.

Comrade Luan, who came with me, lived not far from the reservoir, and asked if I would like to go in for a glass of water. I was of course willing to visit the home of a young farmer. The three rooms were painted snowy white and bright, and the wardrobes, five-drawer chest, and grandfather clock inside were clearly newly purchased. A thin old woman seemed to be washing something. His wife, Chen Gui'e, worked as a machine operator in the Jinzhou Textile Factory, and happened to be resting that day. This cheerful and healthy young woman was wearing a red jacket and patting the baby on the kang. I praised them for decorating the house beautifully, and she said apologetically, "Oh, is it beautiful? It's so narrow that you can't even turn around. The farmers in this area have all built new houses—we were originally going to build this year too, and the land has already been allocated to us."

When I came out, I asked this secretary of the Communist Youth League why he hadn't built a house this year? He said that the original plan was to use the eight hundred yuan or so work points from last year, plus previous savings, to build a few tile-roofed houses, but this year the chairman called on everyone to invest as much as possible to support the expansion of the farm, so he invested all eight hundred yuan at once.

"You invested everything, so what will your family eat?" I asked with concern.

"There are only three or two of us, Gui'e's salary is enough to spend."

We walked and talked along a stream. At this time, there were three or four girls washing their feet in the stream. They rolled up their trouser legs to their knees, and their feet splashed on the pebbles in the water, as if competing to see whose water splashes were bigger and which ones made louder sounds. As they splashed, they talked and laughed, and the double braids tied with silk ribbons bounced on their shoulders. One of them, especially naughty, even weaved a flower crown out of elm leaves and wore it on her head.

"Little farmers, why aren't you working?" I asked in a somewhat reproachful tone.

They giggled. The one wearing the flower crown pointed to a few schoolbags on the rocks and said:

"Can't you see we just got out of school?"

They are the daughters of farmers, and they just came back from Qilicun Elementary School.

We climbed along the terraced fields towards the top of Daheshang Mountain. The steep peaks were set against a sky as blue as ancient porcelain, and the whole mountain was covered with brocade-like wildflowers. There was a lot of white jade stone in this mountainous area, and wild apricots and wild jujubes grew out of the cracks in the rocks, as beautiful as potted plants. Black pines swayed in the wind like candlesticks. The dog watching the sheep barked loudly when it saw strangers.

After crossing a mountain, we came to one of the three major historical sites of the farm - Chaoyang Temple, which was rebuilt in the Ming Dynasty. This ancient temple is surrounded by mountains on all sides. The flagpole in front of the mountain gate is a bit tilted, and the two dragons playing with pearls outside the mountain wall have long stopped spraying water. Apart from that, the temple and the Buddhist hall are very well preserved. There were several blooming wisteria under the stone steps of the main hall. In the Zen hall, an old monk in his eighties was sitting cross-legged on the kang, with his palms together.

Climbing up the mountain wall around Chaoyang Temple, you can see a newly planted sapling from a distance. A huge wooden sign stands in the sapling bushes, which reads "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Youth Friendship Scenic Forest." Those 20,000 saplings were planted in one day in March. On this day, six hundred young people from farms, troops and factories came to create a new orchard in this barren mountain in a tense and happy labor.

After crossing the mountain of the "Scenic Forest", Xiangshui Temple lay in the valley. Outside the temple, a writhing coiled dragon was carved along the rocks, sticking out its tongue and spewing a torrent of spring water. Below knelt a lifelike golden toad that could almost see its sinews, its clumsy claws lying on the stone platform, its eyes bulging, and its mouth open, with the spring water just flowing into its mouth. The dragon's body and the toad's back were covered with fluffy, dark green moss.

On the deep and silent vermilion temple gate, one side was written "Grotto Heaven" and the other side was written "Blessed Land". A very conspicuous slogan was pasted on the flower wall: "Cooperation is developing greatly, class enemies are unwilling, do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention, and strictly prevent the enemy from taking advantage of the loopholes."

"Blessed Land" also needs people to protect it themselves.

Walking into the temple gate, a refreshing fragrance blew in the wind. Two Chinese parasol trees, like Heng and Ha two generals, stood in front of the Hou Hall. Next to them, a spring stream flowed out of the "Yaoqin Cave". In the courtyard were several bright and clean guest rooms, with a mountain crabapple and peony planted in front of them.

The young farmers pointed to me, here is the planned fish pond, and there is the old people's home that the farm will start building this year. Xiangshui Temple will become a sanatorium for the farm. In this quiet world, the singing of birds and the fragrance of flowers, the gurgling spring water, and the refreshing pine waves will play a moving movement for the farmers. (End)

    凤凰坡上的人们——访问金县友谊果园集体农庄

    五、一段朴素的自白
    农庄的办公室每天早上六点开始办公。五点三刻光景，就总有一个五十开外、穿着整齐的深色制服的人推着辆崭新的自行车，从山脚走上来。新车子在农庄上不算新鲜，穿得整齐些也很平常，可是这个人在举止神情上仿佛跟农庄上的人不完全一样。怎么说好呢？起码是斯文了些。一问，才知道他过去是个资本家，去年“高潮”中间参加进来的。
    “挺积极，”麻主席肯定地说，这么一来引起了我的好奇。他究竟是怎样个积极法儿？为了什么积极的呢？咱们还是让这个中等身材、喜欢蹙起浓黑的眉毛，态度谦虚和蔼，说话慢，声音小的庄员张炳中自己来谈谈吧。
    “是的，半年以前，这幢主席办公室和周围这两千来棵果树，是我私人的产业。自从友谊果园集体农庄成立，我就请求加入过。去年十月报上发表了毛主席关于农业合作化运动的报告以后，我这个愿望终于实现了。论吃穿，我倒没愁过，可是我一辈子从来没像今天这么畅快。每天早晨四点多钟我就起来，从金县骑着车到这儿，来回三十里路，我一点儿也不觉得累。我只觉得这五十多年没白活，像我这么个人，居然也参加了社会主义的建设，心里真是说不出的高兴，感到光荣。
    “我们家里哥儿五个，我是老五。我跟家兄在金县开了不少年的百货店。门面不小，可是‘小鼻子’（日本人）把着货源，这不许进，那不许进，做生意成天受‘株式会社’的气。三十来年以前，我们哥儿们眼看着买卖越做路子越窄，就从资本里挪出四千块钱，买下这座荒山。心里想，这回从商转到农，自己有了货源，再也不至于受气了吧。于是，就批树苗，雇把式，重新奠定家业。
    “哪知道城里有‘株式会社’，乡下也有乡下的‘株式会社’。结的苹果都归他们收购，他们把苹果分做‘福、禄、寿’三等，价钱随他们定，等级随他们评，气得许多种果树的都嘁哧咔哧地把树砍了。种上一棵树，要十年才结果子，稍微有点儿办法的人，谁忍心砍呀！我们哥儿们咬着牙，算是没砍。可是小鼻子把我们可挤兑苦啦。
    “跟您说，从打解放那天起，我好几宿兴奋得睡不着觉，这不是假话。祖传的那点儿家产快给小鼻子刮光了还不算，更难忍受的是那份亡国奴的日子。没当过‘满洲国顺民’的人，是不会明白那个滋味儿的。不管怎样，我又当上中国人啦，您说我怎么不打心里高兴。从前我们哥儿们踩在‘小鼻子’脚底下，解放以后，家兄当了地方贸易公司的经理，又是金县工商联的主任委员，我从1950年就当上了县人民代表。我们哥儿们一直感到共产党和人民政府对我们的信任和器重，我们认为建设社会主义自己也有一份儿责任。
    “入庄以前，想到自己从此以后不再是靠剥削人过日子的资本家啦，我当然高兴。可是我心里还嘀咕着一件事：当庄员固然光荣，不过庄员得劳动呀。照我这么副娇生惯养的身子骨儿，年纪又五十开外啦，干得了力气活儿吗？今年一月扩庄以后，农庄重新举行了选举。我不但当选作庄员代表（一共两百名），而且在庄员代表大会上，麻主席宣布全农庄十一名脱产干部（包括三位主席）名单的时候，我的名字也在里头，是办公室里唯一的技术员，这我真没想到。开完会，麻主席对我说：你身体差一些，不一定搞体力劳动，还是多钻研钻研技术，在经营管理上发挥些力量吧。
    “起初，我想农庄这不过是照顾我，不会认真希望我管什么事情的。可是主席派给我的头一个任务就是帮助会计整理账目。账目，这是整个农庄的老底儿呀！有时候三位主席到各生产队视察工作，叫我也一道去。生产队长们瞅见我，也一定征求我对他们工作的意见。我一寻思，不对，我不但是个庄员代表，而且还是农庄上的一个负责干部呢，我得拿出主人翁的精神来。
    “今年五月，我发见山坡底下第三队有三亩牧草场没耕，地不耕，草就长不旺。我向主席汇报了。主席叫我直接跟他们谈去。我到第三队的队部，队长不在。我找到副队长，把情况一讲，他说好，马上动手。等下午在办公室碰到队长，跟他一提，他说，已经耕起来啦。
   “今年四月开庄员代表大会的时候，麻主席在会上说农庄扩大以后，需要大笔款子，号召庄员们尽量投资。在分组讨论的时候，我就表示除了这点儿果树，我在信用合作社还存着六千块钱，我愿意全拿出来投资。会开完以后，我又连夜赶到大连去找我嫂子、出了嫁的闺女和我姐姐，动员她们一齐把储蓄投到农庄上来，支持扩庄工作。这样东拚西凑，一共弄了一万三千元。主席说了些勉励我的话，告诉我款子照样算利息，并且随用随取。
    “我这是私下里向您表示一下：我在金县还有一座冷藏库，那是过去为了对付‘株式会社’盖的。要是农庄需要的话，我也想投进来。反正家里就剩我和我的老伴儿啦。闺女在大连教小学，女婿是大连医学院的讲师，他俩都是团员。
    “我这样做是应该的。那几千块钱积蓄还不都是解放以后挣的——也就是人民给的！只有共产党来了才不欺负种果树的，还给我们技术上的指导，发信用贷款，叫供销社照合理的价钱收购苹果，生意这才好起来。以前‘小鼻子’压低价钱，我一赌气把收的苹果往仓库里一放，宁可让它烂掉也不卖。解放以后，那仓库就没使过一回。咱们的苹果不但过黄河、长江，还到了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克，换回了机器。
    “我就有一个心思——我想，每个中国人都有这个心思：就是早点儿把社会主义社会建设好，叫大家都过好日子。”
    六、临别的巡礼
    到这里三天了，不论走到坡上坡下，远远总听到一片嘹亮的歌声，还有一种沉重的砸地的声响，好像给歌声打着拍子。农庄正在修建一座水库，这是扩庄以后的一个壮举，离开农庄以前，一定得去巡礼一下。
    一路上，我们看到农庄搞的许多种副业。碧绿的樱桃树丛里挂着雪白的粉丝。铁匠炉呼哧呼哧拉着风箱，铁砧一落，迸出万瓣火花。庄员们使的农具，大车的零件，百十来匹骡马的掌铁，都由这里制造。
    第二队一个负责养兔子的庄员正把六十几只兔子从铁笼子里放出来晒太阳。他指着那些长耳朵短鼻子的动物说：别看它们个子小，用处可大得很呢。毛可以给庄员们缝手套，肉吃起来赛过白鸡，血还可以拿来作疫苗，往牛身上打。农庄什么副业都有兴趣搞。今年蜂箱要大大增加，现在还试养着狐狸和黄鼠狼。
    夯歌的声音一起一伏的，越唱越响了，山坡上出现了挑土队长长的行列，他们肩上的扁担颤颤巍巍发出吱吱的声音，远远听去，像是秋虫的鸣声。两山的窄谷里，拦腰已经垫起一道堤坝了。三架夯木，每架围着五、六个小伙子，胳膊硬得像棒锤似的。他们把笨重的夯木扬到半空，随后使劲把它往地上一砸。三个唱夯歌的一边砸，一边顺口编着合平仄压韵的词儿，唱一句，大家跟一句。
    喂，水库要修好呀，
    砸夯要砸牢哇，
    喂，要办社会主义事儿呀，
    大家来使劲儿哇，
    夯歌一下表扬起挑土队，一下批评了“二夯脸朝天”，这张唱出来的黑板报时而刺激，时而鼓舞，真是反映现场、推进劳动尖锐有力的宣传武器。
    我木然站在土岗上，完全被那动人的夯歌吸引住了。在蓝图上，这将是农庄未来的发电站。
    陪我来的栾同志的家离水库不远，问我想不想进去喝杯水。我当然愿意去拜访一位青年庄员的家庭。三间房粉刷得雪白熷亮，里面摆的衣柜，五屉橱和座钟，一看就知道是新置的。一位瘦瘦的老婆婆，好像正在洗着什么。他的爱人陈桂娥在金州纺织厂当看机工，这天刚好休息。这个愉快、健康的青年妇女穿着件红袄，正在拍着炕头上的娃娃。我夸他们房子布置得漂亮，她像是很抱歉地说，“唉，还漂亮哪！窄得都转不开身啦。这一带庄员们都盖了新房——俺们本来今年也要盖的，地都给俺们拨好啦。”
    出来的时候，我问这位团支书今年为什么没盖房子？他说最初是计划用去年分的八百多元工分，加上以前的积蓄，盖几间瓦房，可是今年主席号召大家尽量投资，支持扩庄，所以他把八百多元一下子都投进去了。
    “都投进去，你们一家大小吃什么呢？”我关切地问。
    “俺们就那么三两口子，桂娥的工资足够花了。”
    我们沿着一道涧溪，边说边走着。这时候，涧沟里有三四个女孩子在溪水里洗脚。她们把裤脚挽到膝盖上，脚丫儿吧叽吧叽地踩着水里的卵石，好像在比赛着谁的水花儿大，看哪个踩得响。随踩，随说笑着，用丝带扎了蝴蝶结的双辫儿在她们肩背上一颠一颠的。当中一个特别顽皮的，还用榆树叶子编了个花冠，戴在头上。
    “小庄员们，怎么不去干活儿呀？”我装出带点责怪的口气问。
    她们吃吃笑了起来。那个戴花冠的指了指岩石上的几只书包说：
    “不看见俺们刚下学吗？”
    她们是庄员的闺女，这是刚从七里村小学回来。
    我们沿着一级级的梯田，朝着大和尚山顶爬，峻峭的山峰衬着蓝得像古瓷一样的天，满山都是织锦般的野花。这一带山地白玉石很多，一棵棵的野杏和野酸枣从石缝里挺然钻了出来，标致得好似盆景似的。黑松像一柄柄蜡烛，在风中摇曳着。看羊的狗瞅见生人，老远就汪汪汪地吠了起来。
    翻过一道山去，我们来到农庄的三大古迹之一——明朝重修的朝阳寺。这座古庙四面环山，山门前头的旗杆有些倾斜，山墙外头的二龙戏珠早已不喷水了。除此以外，寺院和佛堂都保存得十分完整。大殿的石阶下面有几架盛开的藤萝。禅堂里一位八十开外的老僧正盘腿坐在炕上，合十打坐。
    绕过朝阳寺山墙往上爬，远远可以看到一片新栽的树苗，树苗丛中竖着巨大的木牌，写着“工农兵青年友谊风景林”。那两万株树苗是三月里一天栽成的。这一天，从农庄、部队和工厂里来了六百个青年，一阵紧张愉快的劳动，就在这个荒山上创造出一座新的果木林。
    翻过“风景林”的山头，响水观就躺在山谷了。观外顺着岩石雕出一条张牙舞爪的盘龙，吐着舌头，喷出一道汹涌的泉水。下面跪着一只逼真得几乎可以看到筋骨的金蟾，笨爪子趴在石台上，鼓着眼睛，张了嘴，泉水刚好流进它的嘴里。龙身和金蟾的背上都长满了毛茸茸的，墨绿色的青苔。
    深寂的朱色寺门上，一扇写着“洞天”，一扇写着“福地”。花墙上贴着一张很醒目的标语：“合作化大发展，阶级敌人不甘心，搞好护林防火，严防敌人把空钻。”
    “福地”也还需要人们自己来保护的。
    走进寺门，迎风一阵清香，垕殿前面像哼哈二将似的屹立着两棵梧桐，旁边从“瑶琴洞”里流出一道泉溪。跨院里是几间窗明几净的客房，前面栽着一片山海棠和牡丹。
    年轻的庄员向我指点着，这里是计划中的养鱼池，那里是农庄今年就要动工的养老院。响水观将成为农庄的一座休养所。在这幽静的世界里，鸟语花香，淙淙的泉水，和沁人肺腑的松涛将为庄员们奏出一曲动人的乐章。　（完）
