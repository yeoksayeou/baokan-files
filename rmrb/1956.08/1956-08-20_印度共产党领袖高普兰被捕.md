    印度共产党领袖高普兰被捕
    新华社新德里19日电　据印度报业托辣斯消息，阿麦达巴第二司法官普罗希特八月十八日把人民院印度共产党议会党团领袖高普兰的案件的审讯日期推迟到八月二十四日。高普兰是八月十七日以所谓违反市内禁令的罪名在阿麦达巴的古吉拉特印度共产党总部被捕的。
    印度共产党发言人在阿麦达巴说，在逮捕高普兰的时候并没有出示任何逮捕情由。高普兰现在正在萨巴马提中央监狱进行绝食，以表示抗议。
    高普兰在被捕前在阿麦达巴参加了八月十七日晚间举行的一个群众集会。据印度报业托辣斯消息说，他在当晚曾经发表谈话，主张组织声势浩大的运动来要求调查警察开枪射击抗议成立孟买双语言省的群众的事件。
    在高普兰被捕以前，人民社会党的两个领袖议会议员卡马特和孟买立法会议议员阿穆尔德赛也在八月十五日因“违犯宵禁”在阿麦达巴被捕。
