	New Achievements in Soviet Cinema
	One New Feature Film Every Three Days
	During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will produce 500 feature films, 300 of which will be in color. By the end of the Five-Year Plan (1960), at least 120 films will be produced annually, meaning that a new feature film will be released to audiences every three days on average. Approximately 400 scientific and technical films will be produced each year. These films will not only showcase the latest achievements in Soviet science but also the wonders that Soviet scientists aim to realize in the future. For instance, audiences will see in a fantasy film how a magical rocket makes its first interstellar journey.
	In terms of screenwriting, efforts will be made to organize new talent and expand the ranks of writers, and to widely engage veteran Party members, participants in the domestic and Patriotic Wars, as well as sailors, travelers, scientists, and others with practical life experience and specialized knowledge in this endeavor.
	Accelerating the Production of Wide-Screen Films
	The production of wide-screen films occupies an important position in Soviet film production during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This work is being accelerated. Wide-screen films that are about to be produced include: “Prologue,” depicting the 1905 Russian Revolution; “And Quiet Flows the Don,” based on Sholokhov's novel; and “The Life of Don Quixote,” based on the novel by Spanish writer Cervantes.
	During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, more than forty feature films and many documentaries will be produced for wide-screen projection. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will have more than seven hundred wide-screen cinemas.
	The Largest Film Studio in the Soviet Union Continues to Expand
	The Mosfilm studio, the largest in the Soviet Union, is currently undergoing expansion. By 1958, the studio will have dozens of buildings, covering an area of 43 hectares. It will have two interior sets, each with a large interior stage and two small interior stages. By adopting the latest scientific and technological achievements, it will be possible to ensure that even during periods of intense work, there will be no general noise or chaotic scenes. Lights can be moved to any corner of the stage via bridging; directors and principal cinematographers can sit at their desks and view film footage of various scenes via television devices. Four exterior sets are being installed on the studio grounds, in addition to a 20-hectare exterior set in the suburbs.
	These new buildings and equipment will enable the Mosfilm studio to produce 150 feature films during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a number almost equivalent to the total number of feature films produced by all Soviet film studios during the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
	Meeting Wide Audiences Abroad
	With the increasing frequency of cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and other countries, Soviet films are having more and more opportunities to meet foreign audiences.
	In Britain, a seven-week "Soviet Film Festival" recently concluded, showcasing more than twenty films. In the United States, the films "The Gadfly," "A Woman's Wiles," "Romeo and Juliet," "Twelfth Night," and "Boris Godunov" were screened during the first half of this year. In Iran, the Baku Film Studio's musical film "To Our Dear People" was recently shown. In Uruguay, an international exhibition of scientific, documentary, and children's films was held, where the Soviet films "Two Friends," "In the Center of the Arctic," and "Searching for the Invisible Enemy" won awards. In Bulgaria, nineteen Soviet feature films were screened for audiences in the first half of this year. In China, a Soviet Film Week will also be held in the second half of this year, with plans to screen films such as "Mother," "An Unfinished Story," and "Soldier Ivan Brovkin."

    苏联电影的新成就
    每三天出一部新艺术片
    苏联在第六个五年计划期间要生产五百部艺术片，其中三百部都是彩色的。到五年计划末（1960年），每年至少生产一百二十部，平均每三天就有一部艺术片和观众见面。科学技术片每年大约生产四百部。在这些影片中不仅能看见苏联科学方面的最新成就，而且还能看到苏联科学家在将来要实现的奇迹。例如，观众们将从一部幻想故事片里看到神奇的火箭怎样第一次在星球间航行。
    在电影剧本编写方面，要组织新生力量和扩大作家队伍，并将广泛吸收老党员、参加国内战争和卫国战争的人以及海员、旅行者、科学家等有实际生活体验和专门知识的人参加这项工作。
  宽银幕影片的制作加速进行
    宽银幕影片的生产在苏联第六个五年计划期间的影片生产中占有重要的地位。这项工作正在加速进行。即将拍制成的宽银幕影片有：描写1905年俄国革命的“序幕”，根据萧洛霍夫的小说编制的“静静的顿河”以及根据西班牙作家塞万提斯的小说编制的“吉呵德先生传”等。
    在第六个五年计划中，要为宽银幕生产四十多部艺术片和许多纪录片。到第六个五年计划末尾，苏联将拥有七百多个宽银幕电影院。
  全苏最大的制片厂继续扩建
    莫斯科制片厂是苏联最大的制片厂，现在正在扩建中。这个厂到1958年将拥有几十个建筑物，占地四十三公顷。它将有两个内景楼，每个楼里都有一个大内景场和两个小内景场。由于将要采用最新的科学技术成就，可以保证在工作非常紧张的时候也不会听到一般的嘈杂声，看不到忙乱的现象。电灯可以通过架桥调动到场内的各个角落；导演和主要的摄影师可以坐在自己的桌旁从电视装置里看到各个场面的电影镜头。在制片厂的厂地上正在装置四个外景场，此外在城郊还有一个占地二十公顷的外景场。
    这些新的建筑和设备将使莫斯科制片厂在第六个五年计划中生产一百五十部艺术片，这个数目几乎相当于全苏联各制片厂在第五个五年计划期间生产的艺术片的总数。
    和广大的外国观众见面
    随着苏联与各国文化交流的日益频繁，苏联电影和外国观众见面的机会越来越多了。
    在英国，不久前结束了七周的“苏联电影节”，放映了二十余部影片。在美国，今年上半年上演了“牛虻”，“游手好闲的女人”，“柔密欧与幽丽叶”，“第十二夜”和“波里斯·戈都诺夫”等片。在伊朗，最近放映了巴库制片厂出品的音乐片“给亲爱的人民”。在乌拉圭，举行了国际科学、纪录和儿童影片展览，苏联的三个影片“两个朋友”“在北极中央”和“寻找看不见的敌人”获了奖。在保加利亚，今年上半年有十九部苏联艺术片和观众见面。在中国，今年下半年也将举行苏联电影周，准备放映“母亲”、“没有结束的故事”、“士兵伊万·布罗伏金”等影片。
