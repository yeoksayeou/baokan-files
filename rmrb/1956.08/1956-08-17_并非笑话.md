    On July 25th, a section-chief level Party member cadre in the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau opened the "People's Daily." Suddenly, he was as astonished as Columbus discovering a new continent: "How did the People's Daily become two pages!" In fact, the "People's Daily" had "become two pages" twenty-five days before his "astonishment." Unfortunately, he had "long neglected" the newspaper and didn't discover it in time.

    In Baotou City, Inner Mongolia, a section chief in a certain government agency gave a mobilization report on increasing production and practicing economy at a meeting. He said, "Recently, a Geneva conference was held in Korea to discuss the issue of increasing production and practicing economy." The people present couldn't help but burst out laughing. This section chief was unhappy to see everyone laughing and solemnly said, "Increasing production and practicing economy is a serious political task. Don't giggle!" As a result, everyone laughed even harder.

    These two section-chief level cadres didn't intend to make jokes on purpose, but they usually don't pay attention to studying current events and politics, so these "accidents" occurred. The former section-chief level cadre doesn't read the newspaper, knows little, and is just "astonished" by himself. The latter section chief doesn't read the newspaper, knows little, but makes wild guesses and pretends to know a lot. He criticizes other comrades for being unserious, but look! Who is being unserious?

    并非笑话
    七月二十五日，蚌埠铁路分局一个科长级的党员干部打开了“人民日报”。突然，他像哥仑布发现新大陆似的惊奇起来：“人民日报怎么变成两张了！”其实，在他“惊奇”的二十五天以前，“人民日报”已经“变成两张”，可惜他“久违”报纸，没有及时发现。
    内蒙古包头市某机关一个科长在大会上做增产节约动员报告，他说：“最近在朝鲜开了个日内瓦会议，讨论增产节约问题。”到会的人听了，不禁失声笑出来。这位科长见大家发笑，很不高兴，郑重其事地说：“增产节约是严肃的政治任务，不要嘻嘻哈哈！”这样一来，大家更加笑个不休。
    这两位科长级的干部，并不是故意要制造笑话，而是平时不注意时事政治的学习，所以发生了这样的“事故”。前一位科长级的干部不看报，知道的事情少，只是自己“惊奇”一下；后一位科长不看报，知道的事情少，却又胡拉混扯，假充知道的事情多。他批评别的同志不严肃，请看吧！究竟是谁不严肃呢？
