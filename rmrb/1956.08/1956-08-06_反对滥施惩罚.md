    Oppose the Indiscriminate Use of Punishment
    The July 27th edition of the Liaoning Daily published a letter from a poor commune member entitled "Why Treat Me This Way?" and simultaneously published an editorial titled "Listen to the Voice of a Poor Commune Member."

    The poor commune member Liu Zhongwen was refused help when he requested assistance in solving his difficulties, and was forced to work for the farm for a few days to earn a living. As a result, he was accused of "sabotaging the cooperative" and being "almost like a counter-revolutionary," not only was he subjected to "struggle sessions," but he was also fined fifteen workdays. In the end, he was even deprived of the right to participate in the cooperative's labor, leaving him with no way out. After briefly describing these circumstances, the editorial pointed out: How can a poor commune member be treated like this? How can one treat one's own class brothers in this way?

    The editorial criticized this crude punitive approach, and said: Is this how our Party teaches us to treat the masses? Can "consolidating the cooperative" really be achieved by relying on this method? The commune cadres who are obsessed with "fining workdays" should be told: doing so does not maintain any labor discipline, but directly violates the cooperative's charter and unreasonably deprives members of the solemn right to participate in labor within the cooperative.

    The editorial concluded: Liu Zhongwen's appeal represents the current situation of some poor commune members being discriminated against and attacked within the cooperative, and also reflects the serious commandism and indiscriminate punishment that is growing among some cooperative cadres. It is hoped that rural Party and government leading organs will pay attention to this appeal and work together to correct this erroneous style of work, and not allow this bad style to develop.

### 反对滥施惩罚

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    反对滥施惩罚
    七月二十七日的辽宁日报刊载了一个贫困社员写的“为什么这样对待我？”的来信，同时以“听听一个贫困社员的呼声”为题发表社论。
    贫困社员刘忠文因要求帮助解决困难遭到拒绝，不得已给农场做了几天工来挣钱糊口。结果，被加上了“破坏合作社”“简直赶上了反革命分子”的罪名，不但挨了“斗争”，还被罚扣十五个劳动日。最后，他连参加社的劳动的权利也被剥夺了，弄得走头无路。社论简述了这些情况以后指出：怎么可以这样来对待一个贫困的社员？怎么可以这样来对待自己的阶级弟兄呢？
    社论批判了这种粗暴的惩罚主义的作风，并说：难道我们党是这样教导我们来对待群众的吗？难道依靠这种办法竟能“巩固合作社”吗？应当告诉醉心于“罚劳动日”的社干部：这样做并不能维护什么劳动纪律，而是直接违背了社章，无理剥夺了社员参加社内劳动的庄严权利。
    社论最后指出：刘忠文的这个呼吁，代表了一部分贫困社员目前在社内受歧视受打击的现状，也反映了在一部分合作社干部中滋长着严重的强迫命令、滥施惩罚的作风。希望农村党政领导机关重视这个呼吁，共同起来纠正这种错误作风，不能让这种坏作风发展下去。
