Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 5th: Some secondary school principals and teachers in Tianjin recently visited Nankai University and held a discussion with some of the university's teachers on how to connect university and secondary school education.

    At the symposium, Nankai University teachers generally agreed that the quality of high school graduates has been improving year by year, but it still falls short of the requirements of higher education. Teachers felt in their daily teaching that some students had not learned ordinary basic knowledge well enough during their secondary school years, which was a very prominent problem. Several teachers mentioned that the general Chinese language proficiency of current students is relatively low, and many students have grammatical errors and unclear wording in their exam papers and even their graduation theses. Teachers also pointed out that some science students can only memorize formulas and do not understand the basic concepts of certain scientific definitions or terms. This situation adds some difficulties to university education.
    The symposium also discussed the cultivation of students' independent thinking ability and some issues in the current high school curriculum. Some people believe that high school grades one, two, and three currently have more than a dozen subjects, and the curriculum is too scattered with too many threads. As a result, students feel overburdened, learning everything but not learning anything well. Teachers also raised opinions on issues such as the insufficient connection between the content of university and secondary school textbooks.

### 天津部分大中学校教师座谈大中学校教育衔接问题

    天津部分大中学校教师
    座谈大中学校教育衔接问题
    据新华社天津5日电　天津市一些中学的校长和教师在最近访问了南开大学，和南开大学的部分教师就怎样使大学和中学的教育衔接起来这个问题进行了座谈。
    在座谈会上，南开大学的教师一致认为近年来高中毕业生的质量是一年比一年提高了，但和高等学校的要求还有距离。教师们在日常教学中感到：有些学生在中学时期对于普通基础知识学得不够好，是个很突出的问题。好几个教师都谈到目前一般学生的语文程度较低，不少学生答考试卷甚至作毕业论文，都有些地方语法不通、词不达意。教师们也指出有些理科学生只会背诵公式，并不了解某些科学定义或术语的基本概念。这种情况给大学教育增加了一些困难。
    座谈会中还谈到培养学生独立思考能力以及目前高中课程设置上的一些问题。有人认为现在高中一、二、三年级都是十几门功课，课程过于分散，头绪太多。这样学生就感到负担过重，样样都学，样样都学不好。教师们还就大、中学的教材内容不够衔接等问题提出了意见。
