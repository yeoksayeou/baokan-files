    Formalistic Inter-Factory Competition
    Li Qian
    
    At the end of July, the Xi'an Municipality construction industry conducted the evaluation of the second quarter inter-factory competition. Originally, there were twenty-nine units participating in the competition, but this time only seventeen units participated in the evaluation. During the evaluation, some groups did not exchange experiences through the evaluation process, but merely compared the completion of indicators item by item. Some groups only held one meeting and then stopped because individual units expressed unwillingness to participate in the evaluation.
    
    Why is the evaluation work of the Xi'an Municipality construction industry's inter-factory competition so sluggish? The fundamental reason is that the inter-factory competition itself has not been carried out well.
    
    The Xi'an Municipality construction industry's inter-factory competition started in the second quarter of this year. At that time, some units did not mobilize all employees to formulate competition conditions. The competition conditions of the Northwest First Engineering Company and the Second Engineering Company were formulated by leaders and were not discussed with the workers. After the competition started, some units mentioned it briefly through blackboards or broadcasts, while others did not even do these simple tasks. Workers and grassroots cadres in some units did not even know that their units had started competition with fraternal companies, let alone how to achieve the competition conditions. Even some leaders of the units were like this. The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Northwest First Engineering Company, after being transferred to this company in early May, led the company's advanced producer movement. However, it was not until the evaluation committee asked them to summarize the inter-factory competition materials in July that he knew that his company had participated in the competition.
    
    The reason why the Xi'an Municipality construction industry's inter-factory competition became a mere formality is also because the evaluation committee leading the inter-factory competition did not fulfill its due responsibilities. Not long after the start of the competition, the evaluation committee formulated a provisional method for the construction industry's inter-factory competition. Now, upon inspection, most of the provisions in it have fallen through. For example, it was originally stipulated that the competition evaluation committee should organize forces every month to focus on one or two units, conduct on-site summaries or inspections. However, later it only conducted one inspection in April. It was originally stipulated that each participating unit should check the implementation of the competition conditions on a monthly basis, report to the municipal competition evaluation committee, and the Xi'an Municipal Construction Trade Union should conduct monthly summaries and announce the competition results. However, of the twenty-nine units participating in the competition, only twenty-one units submitted reports to the evaluation committee in April, and only seven units wrote reports in May. The Xi'an Municipal Construction Trade Union also did not conduct summaries or announce the competition results. It is said that at this time the situation was already quite serious, and the competition evaluation committee should quickly check and reverse this situation, summarize and introduce the experiences of units that have carried out the competition relatively well, and help units that have not carried out the competition well to catch up. However, the competition evaluation committee still did not do this work.

    形式主义的厂际竞赛
    李茜
    七月底，西安市建筑业进行了第二季度厂际竞赛的评比工作。原来一共有二十九个单位参加竞赛，这次参加评比的却只有十七个单位。在评比中，有些小组没有通过评比来互相交流经验，仅仅是一条一条地比了一下指标完成情况，有的小组只开了一次会，就因为个别单位提出不愿参加评比而停顿下来。
    西安市建筑业厂际竞赛的评比工作为什么这样不景气呢？根本原因在于：厂际竞赛本身就没有很好地开展起来。
    西安市建筑业厂际竞赛是从今年第二季度开始的。当时有些单位就没有发动全体职工来制定竞赛条件。西北第一工程公司、第二工程公司的竞赛条件，是由领导人员制定的，没有拿给工人讨论过。竞赛开始以后，有的单位曾经通过黑板报或广播讲了一下，有的连这些简单的工作也没有做。有的单位的工人和基层干部，连本单位已经同兄弟公司展开竞赛也不知道，更谈不到如何去实现竞赛条件了。甚至有的单位的领导人员也是如此。西北第一工程公司的党委副书记，从五月初调到这个公司以后，就领导公司的先进生产者运动。可是，直到七月份评判委员会要他们总结厂际竞赛材料的时候，他才知道本公司已经参加竞赛。
    西安市建筑业厂际竞赛所以流于形式，领导厂际竞赛的评判委员会没有尽到它应尽的责任，也是原因之一。竞赛开始不久，评判委员会制定了一个建筑业厂际竞赛暂行办法，现在检查起来，其中的规定绝大部分都落空了。例如，原来规定，竞赛评判委员会每月要组织力量，重点深入一个或两个单位，进行现场总结或检查。但是，后来就只在四月份进行过一次检查。原来规定，各竞赛单位按月检查竞赛条件执行情况，报市竞赛评判委员会，并由西安市建筑工会每月进行小结，公布竞赛成绩。但是，参加竞赛的二十九个单位，四月份只有二十一个单位给评判委员会送了报告，五月份只有七个单位写了报告。西安市建筑工会也没有进行小结和宣布竞赛成绩。按说，这时候情况已经相当严重了，竞赛评判委员会应该赶快检查和扭转这种情况，应该对竞赛开展得比较好的单位的经验加以总结和介绍，并且帮助竞赛没有很好地开展起来的单位赶上去。但是，竞赛评判委员会仍然没有做这个工作。
