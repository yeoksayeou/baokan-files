Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 13th, TASS dispatch from Cairo, August 13th: After reading the Egyptian government's statement at a press conference on August 12th, Egyptian President Nasser answered questions from reporters.

Regarding the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, Nasser replied: Freedom of navigation in the canal is not guaranteed by the Suez Canal Company, nor by its board of directors. The sole authority guaranteeing and safeguarding freedom of navigation is the Egyptian government. Egypt has always stated its determination to guarantee freedom of navigation in the canal. No one wants to stop navigation through the canal, as this concerns the interests of all countries in the world.

Nasser said that Egypt opposes any foreign control over the canal. He said that the steps now being taken by Western countries aim to impose collective colonialism on others. We are willing to consult with all relevant countries on the issue of safeguarding freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal.

Nasser said that in 1955, the Suez Canal Company's income was 34 million pounds, of which Egypt only received 1.5 million pounds. However, now, after nationalization, the income will belong to the Egyptian people. We will not use these funds to build palaces, but to benefit the Egyptian people.

Someone asked if Egypt intends to nationalize other companies, including oil companies in the Middle East. Nasser replied, "I have never wanted to nationalize companies in Egypt. As for the Arab countries, that is a matter for the governments of those countries. If Egypt interfered in this matter, it would be interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Egypt is firmly opposed to interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We oppose the Baghdad Pact, and we have made that clear and resolute. As for the rumors that we have expansion plans, that is complete nonsense. I reiterate that we pursue a policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries."

Someone asked whether Egypt would cooperate with the West after the Western countries had taken various measures against Egypt. Nasser said that we are ready to cooperate with the West. Any international problem can be resolved through consultation. We are ready to cooperate with all those who are willing to cooperate.

Someone asked about the financing of the Aswan Dam. Nasser said that the Suez Canal revenue previously owned by the old shareholders will now be used to build the Aswan Dam.

Someone asked how Egypt would cope with a military attack. Nasser said that we will rise up and fight, defend our dignity, and defend our lives to the last drop of blood.

Answering another question, President Nasser said that the Egyptian government will attach great importance to the renovation of the Suez Canal, widening and deepening the waterway, and improving shipping services. Nasser assured that the Egyptian government does not intend to increase canal tolls.

Someone asked when the meeting proposed in the Egyptian government's statement could be held. Nasser said that it could be held at any time. Countries can consult on a meeting date.

Answering another question, Nasser pointed out: "The West says that we have seized the canal. In fact, the canal was previously taken from the Egyptian people and has now returned to the arms of its rightful owner."

President Nasser's press conference aroused great interest among reporters, who listened attentively to President Nasser's statement.

    纳赛尔在记者招待会上表示
    埃及决心保证苏彝士运河航行自由
    反对外国对运河任何管制愿同西方合作协商
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社开罗十三日讯：八月十二日，埃及总统纳赛尔在记者招待会上宣读了埃及政府的声明以后，答复了记者的问题。
    纳赛尔就苏彝士运河航行自由的问题答复说：运河航行自由不是由苏彝士运河公司保证的，也不是由这个公司的董事会保证的。保证和保障航行自由的唯一全权机构是埃及政府。埃及一直表示，它决心保证运河航行自由。没有任何人想停止运河的航行，因为这涉及世界各国的利益。
    纳赛尔说，埃及反对外国对运河建立任何管制。他说，西方国家现在采取的步骤，其目的是要强加给别人以集体殖民主义。我们愿意同一切有关国家磋商保障苏彝士运河航行自由的问题。
    纳赛尔说，1955年苏彝士运河公司收入三千四百万英镑，埃及从中只获得一百五十万英镑。但是，现在，在收归国有以后，收入将归埃及人民所有。这些资金我们不是用来兴建宫殿，而是用来为埃及人民谋福利。
    有人问，埃及是否打算把其他公司，把中东的石油公司也收归国有。纳赛尔答复说，我从来没有想要把在埃及的公司收归国有。至于阿拉伯国家，这是那些国家的政府的事。假如埃及过问这件事，那就是对别国内政的干涉。而埃及是坚决反对干涉别国内政的。我们反对巴格达条约，关于这一点，我们作了明白坚决的表示。至于造谣说我们有扩张计划，那完全是胡说。我再一次声明，我们奉行不干涉他国事务的政策。
    有人问，在西方国家采取了种种反对埃及的措施以后，埃及是否会同西方合作。纳赛尔说，我们准备同西方合作。任何国际问题都可以协商解决。凡是愿意合作的，我们都准备跟它们合作。
    有人问到兴建阿斯旺水坝的资金的问题。纳赛尔说，以前旧股东所有的苏彝士运河收入现在将用来兴建阿斯旺水坝。
    有人问，一旦遇到武力进攻，埃及将如何应付。纳赛尔说，我们将奋起斗争，维护我们的尊严，保卫我们的生命，直到最后一滴血。
    纳赛尔总统在答复另一个问题的时候说，埃及政府将很重视改建苏彝士运河、把河道加宽加深、并且改善航运服务的问题。纳赛尔保证说，埃及政府不打算增加运河通行费。
    有人问，埃及政府声明中建议召开的会议什么时候能举行。纳赛尔说，什么时候都可以。各国可以协商开会日期。
    答复另外一个问题的时候，纳赛尔指出：“西方说，我们夺取了运河。而实际上，运河从前被人从埃及人民手中夺走，现在回到了它的合法主人的怀抱。”
    纳赛尔总统的记者招待会引起了记者极大的兴趣，大家聚精会神地听取了纳赛尔总统的声明。
