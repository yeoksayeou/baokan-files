    The Miao people joyfully celebrated their annual "Ganzhou" festival, a celebration to wish for a bountiful harvest, on August 7th in Malichang, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    On this day, as the sun had just peeked over the mountain ridges, Miao young women wearing white silk embroidered clothing, Miao girls with silver necklaces and silver bracelets, neatly dressed Miao youth, and many Miao elders poured into Malichang from counties like Jishou, Fenghuang, Baojing, and Huayuan, crossing mountains and ridges. On every deep mountain road, the sounds of flutes, songs, and laughter intertwined. Before the sun had reached its peak, the market in this range of mountains was already filled with more than twenty thousand people.

    Nearing noon, the crowd grew larger. Everywhere in the market, people were singing and dancing. On the eight-person swing that was newly built for the celebration, four pairs of young Miao men and women were singing love songs to each other. The youths surrounding the swing were captivated by a mountain song sung by a Miao girl from a nearby village. This girl sang:

    "Girls put on flowered clothes,
    Bracelets and earrings gleam,
    Wool cloaks and hemp sandals,
    Make so many young men dream."

    After hearing her sing this mountain song that held hidden feelings, the youths looked at each other, both shy and happy. An old Miao man named Long Jili, who was sixty-five years old and standing beside the swing, couldn't help but sing heartily:

    "Standing in the field, my heart is joyful,
    I, an old man, can't help but raise my voice in song,
    Thanks to Chairman Mao's great leadership,
    We have such a good life today;
    Don't look at me, an old man, getting old,
    This old man still wants to sing a few youthful songs..."

    Looking from the swing towards the newly built stage, hundreds and thousands of Miao farmers were watching the first Miao language theater troupe of the autonomous prefecture—the Malichang Miao Language Theater Troupe—perform their ethnic plays, "Willow Scarf Dance" and "Rebellion Against the Dynasty." These two plays were recently staged by the Malichang Miao Language Theater Troupe based on Miao folk tales.

    A local Miao resident told the reporter that before liberation, the Miao people lived in extreme poverty, and the "Ganzhou" festival was never lively. After liberation, crops have been harvested in abundance year after year, and people's lives have improved year by year. This year, the large area of double-cropping rice trial-planted in the autonomous prefecture generally yielded four to five hundred jin of dry rice per mu, and the yield of one season exceeded the yield of a bumper year last year. Now, the middle rice has also generally headed, and in these days of harvest, how can the Miao people not be happy?

    As dusk approached, the Miao farmers reluctantly departed. On their way home, their baskets were full of clothing materials and sundries.

### 苗家欢度“赶秋”节

    苗家欢度“赶秋”节
    新华社记者　龙文明
    苗家一年一度预祝丰收的“赶秋”佳节，八月七日在湘西苗族自治州麻里场欢乐地度过了。
    这天，太阳刚从丛山背后露头，穿着白丝绸绣花衣的苗族青年妇女，颈上挂着银项圈，手上戴着银手镯的苗族姑娘们，穿着整洁的苗族青年，和许多苗族老人，从吉首、凤凰、保靖、花垣等县翻山越岭地涌向麻里场来。在每一条深山大路上，笛子声、歌声和笑声，交织成一片。太阳还没当顶，在这个丛山峻岭中的墟场上，已经挤满了两万多人。
    将近中午，人越来越多了。墟场上到处有人在歌舞。在为欢度佳节而新搭起的八人大秋千上，四对苗族男女青年正在对唱情歌。围在秋千下的青年们被附近村寨的一个苗族姑娘唱的一支山歌吸引住了。这个姑娘唱道：
    “姑娘穿起花衣裳，
    手镯耳环闪光芒，
    羊毛斗蓬麻板鞋，
    想坏好多少年郎。”
    青年们听了她唱的这首蕴藏着心事的山歌以后，都面面相看，又羞又喜。站在秋千旁边的一位六十五岁的苗族老人龙纪立，这时候也情不自禁地畅怀欢唱道：
    “站在秋场心欢乐，
    不由我老汉引高歌，
    搭帮毛主席领导好，
    才有今天好生活；
    别看我老汉年纪老，
    老人我还要唱几首少年歌……。”
    从秋千场朝着新搭起来的戏台看去，成百上千的苗族农民正在那里观看自治州成立的第一个苗语剧团——麻里场苗语剧团演唱的本民族的戏——“柳巾舞”和“反江山”。这两个剧本是麻里场苗语剧团根据苗家民间故事最近排演出来的。
    一位当地的苗族老住户告诉记者，解放前，苗族人民生活贫困不堪，年年过“赶秋”节都不热闹。解放后，农作物连年丰收，人民的生活逐年的改善了。今年自治州试种的大面积双季稻早稻一般每亩收了干谷四、五百斤，一季的产量就超过了丰收的去年一年的产量。现在，中稻也已经普遍抽穗，在这丰收的日子里，苗族人民怎么能不高兴呢？
    这天快傍晚了，苗族农民才依依不舍地离去。在回家的时候，他们的背笼里满载着衣料和南货。
