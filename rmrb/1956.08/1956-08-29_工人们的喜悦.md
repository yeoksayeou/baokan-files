    The Workers' Joy
    "Without these measures to care for the lives of the workers, our factory could not have achieved so much." This is what Comrade Stepanovich, the First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Moscow Small Car Factory, said when he received me.
    Indeed, one thing at the Moscow Small Car Factory has attracted much attention recently: the factory's employees, in a short period of two months, completely changed the technological process and replaced the old "Moskvich" car with the new streamlined "Moskvich" car. When this new "Moskvich" was first parked on the streets of Moscow, it often attracted groups of "observers" who surrounded it and made comments; sensitive painters also sketched the scene of "Moskvich surrounding 'Moskvich'" and published it in the newspaper. Recently, I also heard that this factory will produce a new car with simultaneous front and rear axle rotation for rural use by the end of the year.
    On the morning of July 10th, we were sitting in the office of Comrade Blagirevsky, the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the factory. The Deputy Secretary is a slightly serious person of short stature. We explained to him: although we are very interested in the "Moskvich" car, today we are more interested in the people who produce this car and what improvements and enhancements they have had in their lives recently, especially after the 20th Party Congress.
    "All your requirements can be met. If you agree, let's start the interviews right away," the Deputy Secretary immediately replied.
     The Joy of the Old Workers
    "I am fifty-nine years old this year and have been working for forty years, thirty of which have been in the service of the automobile industry. For the first twenty-two years, I was a foundry worker, and now I work as a furnace repairman. The Ministry of Automobile Industry awarded me for my thirty years of labor and gave me a bonus. During the Patriotic War, I fought on the front line for three years and returned to the rear after being wounded. I joined the Party in 1930. My wife has been working as an accountant in another factory for thirty-eight years." When our conversation with the respected veteran worker Petrushin began, his brief self-introduction already portrayed the glorious path he had diligently walked. It was the youth and hands of these simple old workers that exchanged for the industrialization of the world's first socialist country. Then our topic quickly turned to the newly announced preferential treatment bill: "My monthly salary is now 1,200 rubles. According to the old preferential treatment regulations, based on my age, if I continue to work, I can receive a pension of 180 rubles per month in addition to my salary. If I don't work, the full pension is only 240 rubles. But now, according to the new bill, I can get a pension of 900 rubles if I retire, plus my wife's pension of 500 rubles, which is enough for recuperation." Petrushin stroked his gray hair and said, "1,400 rubles a month is not a small amount in Moscow, and my current housing is very spacious. Before the new preferential treatment bill was announced, I had already ordered two overcoats, two suits, and two autumn coats; I have a radio and a television at home. Therefore, the pension will mainly be used for food expenses." Petrushin smiled and said, "Of course, if the factory needs any help from me, I will not spare my strength." Indeed, Petrushin, as well as Semyonovich, 62 years old with 46 years of service, and Kirillovich, 66 years old with 50 years of service, who spoke to us later, are the old generation of workers who have dedicated their lives to the cause of building socialism and communist construction in the Soviet Union. I think the Soviet government's newly announced preferential treatment bill is not only a material guarantee for their later years, but also expresses the sincere gratitude and respect of the entire Soviet people for the older generation of workers.
    Mothers' Gratitude
    Women workers account for 40% of the workers in the Moscow Small Car Factory. The evaluation of these women workers was made by Comrade Stepanovich, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, later. He told us with a satisfied tone: "The women in our factory work very well, very well. They not only complete their tasks excellently at work, but also complete the task of being mothers very well." It is conceivable that after finishing the not-so-easy work in the factory, the women workers have to take care of housework and raise their children after returning home. By the way, it is very rare to hire a nanny in a Soviet family. Therefore, without the qualities of being both hardworking and capable, one cannot bear this burden.
    But this does not mean that women have no difficulties at all. The Soviet government's decisions to implement a six-hour workday on holidays and days off, and to extend maternity leave after the 20th Party Congress, were made after considering the actual situation of women. The female worker Shalnikova, who spoke with us, was obviously very satisfied with the decision to work six hours on Saturdays. She enthusiastically told us how she spent the last two Saturdays. However, Shalnikova is currently pregnant, and she talked more about this major event in her life. "I am an upholstery decorator for car seats. Because I am pregnant, according to the doctor's decision, I have been transferred to do lighter work, and my salary is still 1,100 rubles. After doing three months of light work, I will take a vacation. Because according to the new decision, I can take two months of leave before childbirth and two months of leave after childbirth, a total of four months of paid leave; while in the past, maternity leave was only forty-two days in total. Then, I will take my annual regular vacation. The new decision is a boon for mothers. Now, mothers can rest better, and babies will be stronger." Shalnikova spoke fluently and eloquently, but when she said this, she paused, as if considering whether to say the following words or not. "I already have two sons, and now I want a daughter, because a daughter will be a good helper for her mother. I believe I will have a daughter." Shalnikova smiled and ended her conversation.
    When we said goodbye to Shalnikova, we congratulated her in advance on the health and happiness of her future daughter, although I had a question in my heart: why does Shalnikova think that sons cannot be good helpers for their mothers?
    The Hopes of Young Workers
    Vasilyevich, a seventeen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League and a young worker, has been working six hours a day for eight days. This is because the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the six-hour workday for young workers came into effect on July 1st. Vasilyevich entered the factory after completing the seventh grade of middle school, and he is now studying at the factory's night school. We asked this young worker, who was a little shy at first, to talk about his views on the six-hour workday for young workers. He said: "Young people need to study, do physical exercises, and make themselves healthier. Now that the new decree has come into effect, time for study and physical exercise is guaranteed, and the salary remains the same. I strive to overfulfill my production quota." Later, I learned that the reason why this young man repeatedly mentioned sports was that he was a lover of boxing and track and field. This young worker wanted us to convey his congratulations to the young workers of China: "I hope that the young workers of China will live and work in the manner of members of the Communist Youth League, support the Communist Party, so that the Party can rely on the youth. But the most important thing is to study, work and engage in sports to make themselves stronger."
    I believe that the youth of our country will not disagree with the views of Comrade Vasilyevich of the Communist Youth League.

### 工人们的喜悦

    工人们的喜悦
    “如果没有这些关怀工人生活的措施，我们的工厂就不能够做出这么多的成绩。”这是莫斯科小型汽车工厂党委第一书记斯捷潘诺维奇同志接见我的时候说的话。
    的确，莫斯科小型汽车工厂近来有一件事很受人们的注意：这个工厂的职工在短短的两个月的时间内把工艺过程全部改变，用新的流线型的“莫斯科人”牌汽车代替了旧的“莫斯科人”牌汽车。这种新的“莫斯科人”初次停在莫斯科街头时，经常招来一群群“观察家”的围观和品评；敏感的画家也速写了“莫斯科人包围‘莫斯科人’”的现场情景在报上发表。最近又听说，这个工厂在年底又要生产一种供农村使用的前后轮轴同时转动的新汽车了。
    7月10日早晨，我们坐在工厂党委副书记布拉吉连夫斯基同志的办公室里，党委副书记是一位个子不高、神情稍微有点严肃的人。我们向他说明：我们虽然对“莫斯科人”牌汽车很感兴趣，但是今天我们更感兴趣的是生产这种汽车的人，他们最近以来，尤其是在二十次党代表大会后的生活又有了那些改善和提高。
    “你们的要求都可以满足，如果你们同意的话，现在马上就开始访问。”党委副书记马上答复我们。
     老工人的喜悦
    “我今年五十九岁，已经工作了整整四十年，其中有三十年是为汽车工业服务的，前二十二年是当铸工，现在作修炉工作。汽车工业部为我三十年的劳动而嘉奖我，并发给了奖金。卫国战争期间我曾在前线作战三年，负伤后回后方。我是1930年入党的。我的妻子在别的工厂作会计工作也已经三十八年了。”当我们同大家尊敬的老辈工人彼得鲁辛谈话开始时，他的自我介绍虽然很简短，就已经描画出他勤勤恳恳走过的光荣的道路。就是这些朴实的老辈工人的青春和双手，换来了世界上第一个社会主义国家的工业化。接着我们的话题很快地转到最近公布的新的优抚金法案上去了：“我现在每月的工资是一千二百卢布，按照旧的优抚金法令，根据我的年龄，如果继续工作的话，每月除工资外可拿到养老金一百八十卢布，如果不工作的话，全部养老金只有二百四十卢布。而现在按照新的法案，我退休的话可以拿养老金九百卢布，加上我妻子的养老金五百卢布，就足够休养了。”彼得鲁辛用他的手抚了抚他灰白的头发后又说：“每月一千四百卢布，在莫斯科是不小一笔数目了，况且我现在的住房很宽敞，在新优抚金法案公布前，我就定制了两件大衣、两套西装、两件秋大衣；我家里有收音机和电视机。因此，以后的养老金主要是供伙食用。”彼得鲁辛笑了笑说：“当然，如果工厂需要我任何帮助的话，我将不吝惜我的力量。”的确，彼得鲁辛，以及随后跟我们谈话的六十二岁的有四十六年工龄的谢苗诺维奇、六十六岁的有五十年工龄的基里洛维奇，就是这些老一代的工人，他们毕生的精力都献给了在苏联建成社会主义以及共产主义建设的事业。我想，苏联政府新公布的优抚金法案不仅是对他们晚年生活的物质保证，而且也表达了全体苏联人民对老一代工人的衷心的感谢和尊敬。
    母亲们的感谢
    莫斯科小型汽车工厂的工人中有40％是女工。对于这些女工的评价，是后来党委第一书记斯捷潘诺维奇给我们作的。他带着一种满意的口吻对我们说：“我们工厂的妇女工作得很好，工作得很好，她们不仅在工作上很出色地完成了任务，而且也很好地完成了母亲的任务。”可以想像，在工厂结束了并不轻松的工作以后，女工们回到家庭以后还要照料家务和教养孩子。附带说一句，在苏联家庭里雇用保姆是十分少有的事。因此，没有既耐劳又能干的品质是担不起这付担子的。
    但是这绝不是说妇女们是一点困难也没有了。苏联政府在第二十次党代表大会后采取的休假日和节日前六小时工作日制和延长产妇产假的决定，就是考虑了妇女们的实际情况后作出的。同我们谈话的女工莎尔尼柯娃显然对星期六工作六小时的决定很满意，她津津有味地对我们讲最近两个星期六是怎么度过的。但是，莎尔尼柯娃现在正在怀孕期间，她更多地谈到了她生活中的这件大事。“我是汽车车座的裱衬装饰工人。因为我怀孕，根据医生的决定，我已调做更轻松的工作，工资仍照旧是一千一百卢布。做三个月轻松工作后，我就要休假了。因为按照新的决定，产前可以休假两个月，产后可以休假两个月，前后共有四个月工资照付的假期；而过去产假前后一共是四十二天。接着，我将要度每年照例的休假期。现在新的决定对母亲们是个福音。如今，母亲可以休息得更好，婴儿也会更强壮了。”莎尔尼柯娃说话很流利，而且滔滔不绝，可是说到这里，她停顿了一下，似乎在考虑下面的话讲还是不讲。“我已经有两个儿子了，我现在想要一个女儿，因为女儿将会是母亲的好助手。我相信，一定会生个女儿。”莎尔尼柯娃微笑着，结束了她的谈话。
    我们同莎尔尼柯娃告辞时，预先祝贺了她未来的女儿的健康和幸福，虽然我心中有个疑问：为什么莎尔尼柯娃认为儿子不能成为母亲的好助手呢？
    青年工人的希望
    十七岁的共青团员、青年工人华西里也维奇每天工作六小时已有八天了。这是因为苏联最高苏维埃关于青年工人每天工作六小时的法令在七月一日起生效的缘故。华西里也维奇是读完中学七年级后进工厂工作的，他现在正在工厂的夜校学习。我们请这位开始有点害羞的青年工人谈谈他对青年工人六小时工作日的看法。他说：“年青人需要学习、进行体育锻炼，使自己更健康。现在新的法令生效后，学习和体育锻炼的时间都有保证了，而且工资照旧。我努力使自己超额完成生产定额。”后来了解到这个小伙子所以再三提到体育，他原来是拳击和田径运动的爱好者。这位青年工人要托我们转达他对中国青年工人的祝贺：“我希望中国青年工人按照共青团员的方式去生活和工作，支持共产党，使得党能够依靠青年。但最主要的是学习、工作和从事体育，把自己锻炼得更强壮。”
    我相信，我们国家的青年是不会不同意共青团员华西里也维奇的意见的。
