    Responses to Criticism

    Letter from the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee:

    The reader's letter "Dormitories that Increase Mental Burden," published in the People's Daily on July 5th, criticized our office for not taking adequate care of the welfare of employees. This criticism is basically consistent with the facts. In addition to making a self-criticism, we have made preliminary solutions to problems such as the lack of toilets in the dormitory and the leaking roofs, and we have decided to strengthen our work in this area in the future.

    对批评的反应
    江西省人民委员会来信：
    七月五日人民日报刊载的“增加精神负担的宿舍”的读者来信，批评我处对职工生活福利照顾不够。这一批评，基本上是符合事实的，我们除作检讨外，已对宿舍无厕所、房子漏雨等问题作了初步解决，并决定今后加强这方面的工作。
