He said, "We are convinced that, based on the friendly cooperation and full exchange of experiences among the delegations from various countries, the plant quarantine and plant protection undertakings of our respective countries will achieve further development." He stated, "We must strive to learn advanced science and technology from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, learn advanced science and technology from countries all over the world, and we hope that representatives from various countries will provide suggestions and criticisms for our agricultural science work and plant quarantine and plant protection work."

The heads of the delegations from various countries all congratulated the conference. In their speeches, they all emphasized the importance of cooperation among countries in plant protection science, and emphasized the great significance of this international cooperation for agriculture, for the people's peace and happiness.

At the meeting, congratulatory telegrams from the Chinese Entomological Society and the Chinese Society for Plant Pathology were read.

The International Plant Quarantine and Plant Protection Conference was initiated in 1949 by the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries. Its purpose is to strengthen cooperation among fraternal countries in plant quarantine and plant protection, and to ensure the exchange of agricultural products and the safe development of agricultural production among fraternal countries. The first conference was held in Warsaw in 1949. In 1952, China participated in the fifth conference held in Berlin. The sixth conference was held in Sofia, and the seventh conference was held in Warsaw. China sent delegations to participate in both. Previous conferences mainly focused on discussing the prevention of the Colorado potato beetle. By the fifth conference, the issues discussed had expanded to include five pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, the potato tuber moth, the pear scale insect, the beet moth, and the American white moth, and two diseases, such as potato wart disease and potato nematode disease. Later, the discussion of preventing the cotton bollworm and agricultural medicines and machinery was added.
