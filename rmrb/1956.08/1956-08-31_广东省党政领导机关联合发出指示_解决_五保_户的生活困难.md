Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 28th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently jointly issued instructions, requiring all parts of the province to fundamentally solve the livelihood problems of "Five Guarantees" households.

The instructions stated that in some areas of Guangdong Province, agricultural cooperatives have already implemented varying degrees of guaranteeing food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial for elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members who lack labor power and are completely unable to work, during the summer harvest pre-distribution. However, some areas do not adequately recognize the importance of this work, some have been slow to start, and some are afraid to publicize it openly, only making temporary arrangements secretly within the cooperative. These "Five Guarantees" households still face many difficulties because their production and lives have not received the necessary care and arrangements. Some areas have not accurately identified "Five Guarantees" households, and the subsidy standards are too high or too low. These situations urgently need to be changed.

The instructions put forward: First, implementing the "Five Guarantees" is an important measure to fundamentally solve the production and livelihood problems of this group of people in rural areas after the realization of agricultural cooperation. As long as agricultural cooperatives properly arrange for these people to engage in light work that they are capable of, they can increase their income, and it only requires drawing a portion of the public welfare fund to subsidize them to solve their problems. As for agricultural cooperatives with smaller public welfare funds, the government will still provide them with necessary relief subsidies. Second, the implementation of the "Five Guarantees" should be based on the principle of "developing production and guaranteeing livelihood." First, appropriate light work should be arranged and assessed for "Five Guarantees" households. Then, based on the cooperative's ability to bear the burden and the living standards of local farmers, after deducting the assessed labor income and other income, a fixed amount of subsidy should be given from the public welfare fund to cover the shortfall. After the subsidy amount is assessed, the principle of more work, more pay should still be followed to encourage them. Those who are completely unable to work should be supported by the cooperative. Third, the "Five Guarantees" is a welfare work of the agricultural cooperative and should become a regular system of the agricultural cooperative. Party and government leading departments at all levels must strengthen specific guidance on relevant business work.

    广东省党政领导机关联合发出指示
    解决“五保”户的生活困难
    据新华社广州28日电　中共广东省委员会、广东省人民委员会最近联合发出指示，要求全省各地从根本上解决“五保”户的生活问题。
    指示说，广东省部分地区的农业社在夏收预分中，已对社内缺乏劳动力、完全丧失劳动力、生活无依靠的老弱孤寡残疾社员，实行了不同程度的保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬工作。但是有部分地区对这一工作的重要意义认识不足，有的迟迟未开展；有的不敢公开宣传，只在社里秘密的作临时性的照顾。这些“五保”户由于生产和生活还未得到应有的照顾和安排，他们仍然存在不少困难。有些地区划定“五保”户不够准确，补助标准偏高偏低。这些情况都急需改变。
    指示中提出：一、实行“五保”是农业实现合作化以后，从根本上解决农村中这一部分人生产和生活问题的重要措施，农业社只要妥善安排这些人从事力能胜任的轻活，就可使他们增加收入，只需在公益金中抽一部分补助，便可解决他们的问题。至于公益金较少的农业社，政府仍然对他们给予必要的救济补助。二、实行“五保”要根据“发展生产，保证生活”的原则，首先安排并评定“五保”户一定的合适轻活，再根据社的负担能力和当地农民的生活水平，除去评定的应得劳动收入和其他收入，就它的不足部分在公益金项下给予定额补助，评定补助数量后，仍多劳多得，以资奖励。完全丧失劳动力的由社负责供养。三、“五保”是农业社一项福利工作，它应该成为农业社的一项经常制度，各级党政领导部门必须加强有关业务的具体指导工作。
