    Random Thoughts

    One vicious cycle:
    Suppress criticism → Whispered rumors become popular,
    Whispered rumors become popular → Intensified suppression...
    Round and round, escalating. The only way is to break this cycle, starting with not suppressing criticism.
    One of the worst divisions of labor:
    Leaders manage collective interests;
    The led manage personal interests.
    When leaders pay more and more one-sided attention to collective interests, neglecting the personal interests of the led, the led will pay particular attention to their own personal interests, and may well relax their attention to collective interests;
    When the led single-mindedly pursue personal interests, regardless of collective interests, the leaders have to spend their energy solely on considering collective interests, and thus often neglect the personal interests of the led.

    恶性循环之一：
    压制批评→小广播流行，
    小广播流行→加紧压制……
    周而复始，变本加厉。唯一的办法是打破这个循环，首先不要压制批评。
    最坏的分工之一：
    领导人管集体利益；
    被领导者管个人利益。
    当领导人越是片面地注意集体利益，忽视被领导者的个人利益的时候，被领导者就会特别关心起自己的个人利益来，而对集体利益就很可能放松了；
    当被领导者越是单纯地追求个人利益，不顾集体利益的时候，领导人就只得单独地把心力花在集体利益的考虑上，也就往往忽视了被领导者的个人利益。
