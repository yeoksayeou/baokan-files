    Strive to Prevent and Combat Disasters and Strive for Increased Late Autumn Production
    In early August, a powerful typhoon, rarely seen in decades, struck the southeastern coast of China, causing considerable wind damage in Zhejiang and other provinces. Following this, many provinces and regions in the north experienced successive heavy rainstorms, resulting in varying degrees of flooding. Currently, the people in vast areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are engaged in a heroic struggle against the disasters caused by strong winds and heavy floods.
    At present, the threat of floods has not yet passed. In some areas, such as Heilongjiang Province, the flood situation is still very serious. Under these circumstances, it is essential to overcome the lax attitude of "early flood, early harvest" and continue to work hard on flood prevention, emergency rescue, and the resettlement of disaster victims. In places where riverbanks have breached, all efforts must be made to close the breaches and minimize the losses caused by them as much as possible. In places where riverbanks are in danger, it is necessary to patrol day and night, reinforce the dikes, and strictly prevent breaches, just like the people of Harbin. Racing against water is like a race; whoever can persevere for the last five minutes will achieve the final victory.
    The agricultural season has already passed "Beginning of Autumn." We must make full use of the not-so-generous time from now until the autumn harvest, and do everything possible to prevent and resist disasters to ensure increased production. In severely affected areas, in addition to intensifying rescue and relief efforts, it is also necessary to work hard to drain water from the land, rush to plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables, and replant seedlings, support seedlings, and apply additional fertilizer in late rice fields to reduce and compensate for the losses caused by the disaster. To do these tasks well, we must actively find ways to help disaster victims solve the difficulties of lacking seeds, draft animals, and farm tools in the autumn planting, to ensure timely planting and appropriately expand the area of autumn planting. In lightly affected areas, for the affected crops, timely drainage, supporting seedlings, washing seedlings, cultivating soil, applying additional fertilizer, weeding, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests are necessary to maintain and improve yields and reduce or avoid losses.
    Organizing sideline production in disaster areas is of particular importance. In some severely affected areas, agricultural production is temporarily difficult to fully restore, and organizing disaster victims to develop sideline occupations is even more urgent. If sideline production is well-managed, it can not only support disaster victims in overcoming the current famine, but also support agricultural production in disaster areas next year. Therefore, sideline production in disaster areas, anything that the masses can do and for which there is a market for the products, should be vigorously promoted and its organization intensified.
    Whether the difficulties in the production and lives of the people in disaster areas can be overcome smoothly largely depends on whether the provinces and provinces, counties and counties, townships and townships, and various departments actively support and closely cooperate with each other. To support disaster areas, the central departments should first set an example. Every department related to disaster relief work should, according to its own business scope, strive to improve work efficiency: relief funds should be approved, allocated, and distributed quickly; grain, seeds, and fertilizers should be transferred in a timely manner; additional loans to disaster areas should be issued promptly; and the purchase, transportation, and marketing of local products and specialties in disaster areas should be properly arranged. Any department or unit should resolve the various issues raised by the disaster areas quickly and appropriately, and correct the bureaucratic style of shirking responsibility and passing the buck. Otherwise, it will inevitably delay the opportunity and make major mistakes.
    Disaster relief work is extremely complex and arduous, but we have the full strength and confidence to overcome the various difficulties caused by natural disasters. We possess increasingly strong financial and economic strength, a cooperative mass base, and rich experience in fighting natural disasters. All these conditions, organized by the Party and the government, will surely guarantee victory over this year's natural disasters and strive to complete the country's agricultural production increase plan.

### 努力防灾救灾，争取晚秋增产

    努力防灾救灾，争取晚秋增产
    八月初，几十年来所少见的强大台风袭击我国东南沿海，在浙江等省造成相当严重的风灾。北方许多省区接着连降暴雨，造成程度不等的水灾。现在，浙江、江苏、安徽、河南、河北、吉林、黑龙江等省广大地区的人民，正在和强风大水造成的灾害进行英勇的斗争。
    目前洪水的威胁还没有过去，在某些地区，如黑龙江省，水情还很严重。在这种情况下面，一定要克服那种“早水早收”的松懈情绪，继续努力进行防汛、抢险和抢救、安置灾民的工作。在河堤决口的地方，要全力把决口堵住，尽可能弥补、缩小河堤决口造成的损失。在河堤危急的地方，要像哈尔滨人民那样，昼夜巡护，加固堤防，严防决口。防水和赛跑一样，谁能坚持最后的五分钟，谁就会得到最后的胜利。
    农事节令已经过了“立秋”，我们一定要充分利用从现在到秋收的这段并不宽裕的时间，尽一切力量防灾抗灾，保证增产。在重灾区，目前除了加紧进行抢险、抢救的工作以外，还要努力排水脱地，抢种荞麦、秋菜，并且在晚稻田中补苗、扶苗、增施追肥，力求减轻和弥补灾害的损失。为了做好这些工作，一定要积极设法帮助灾民解决秋种当中缺乏籽种、耕畜、农具的困难，保证及时下种和适当扩大秋种面积。在轻灾区，对于受灾的庄稼，要及时排水、扶苗、洗苗、培土、增施肥料、除草、防治病虫害，力争保持和提高产量，减少或避免损失。
    在受灾地区组织副业生产，有特殊重要的意义。某些重灾区的农业生产，一时难于完全恢复，组织灾民发展副业，更是当务之急。副业生产搞得好，不仅可以支持灾民渡过眼前的灾荒，而且可以支援灾区来年的农业生产。因此，灾区的副业生产，凡是群众能够办到，产品又有销路的，都应当大力提倡，加紧组织。
    灾区人民生产和生活上的困难能不能够顺利克服，在很大程度上决定于省和省、县和县、乡和乡之间以及各个部门之间是不是主动支援和密切配合。为了支援灾区，中央各个部门首先应当作出榜样。每一个和救灾工作有关系的部门，都要根据自己的业务范围，努力提高工作效率：救济款要快批、快拨、快发放，粮食、种子、肥料要及时调拨，对灾区追加的贷款要及时发出，灾区的土产和特产的收购、运输、推销等工作要妥善安排。任何部门、任何单位对于灾区提出的各项问题，要解决的快而妥当，纠正互相推诿、不负责任的官僚主义作风。否则就必然会贻误时机，铸成大错。
    救灾工作是极其复杂、繁重的，但是我们完全有力量、有信心克服自然灾害所造成的各种困难。我们拥有日益壮大的财政经济力量，拥有合作化的群众基础，拥有和自然灾害作斗争的丰富经验，这一切条件由党和政府组织起来，就一定能够保证战胜今年的自然灾害，争取完成国家的农业增产计划。
