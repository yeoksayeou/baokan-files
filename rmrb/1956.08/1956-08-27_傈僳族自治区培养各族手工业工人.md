    Lisu Autonomous Region Trains Handicraft Workers of All Ethnic Groups
    (Our dispatch from Kunming) The People's Committee of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region is taking various measures to train handicraft workers from all ethnic groups. According to the plan of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, in about three years, more than 1,000 handicraft workers of various ethnic groups will be trained in the region, including those specializing in mud work, carpentry, stone work, iron work, brick and tile making, and other crafts. This year, the Autonomous Region Brick and Tile Factory has specifically recruited sixteen young people from the Bai, Nu, Lisu and other ethnic groups as apprentices, and most of them have already learned how to make brick blanks and tile tubes. The counties of the Autonomous Region have sent twenty-seven young people from various ethnic groups to the Lijiang District Iron Factory to learn ironwork. Recently, cooperatives and mutual aid groups in Bijiang County selected more than forty young people to participate in the basic construction work of the Autonomous Region's organs and schools, and to learn various handicrafts. The Autonomous Region People's Government has also allocated a special fund to solve the problems of various tools and living difficulties during their study period. (Qing Gen, Xiang Bi)

    傈僳族自治区培养各族手工业工人
    本报昆明电　怒江傈僳族自治区人民委员会正采取各种措施，培养各民族的手工业工人。根据自治区人民委员会的计划，在三年左右的时间内、在全区要培养出一千多名各民族的泥、木、石、铁、砖瓦等各工种手工业工人。自治区砖瓦厂今年内专门吸收了十六个白、恕、傈僳等族的青年当学徒，现在已经大部分学会了打砖坯、瓦筒。自治区各县送了各族青年二十七人到丽江专区铁工厂学铁工。最近，碧江县的合作社和互助组又选送了四十多个青年参加自治区机关、学校的基本建设工作，并学习各种手工艺。自治区人民政府还拨出一项专款为他们解决各种工具及学习期间的生活困难。　（庆根、向弼）
