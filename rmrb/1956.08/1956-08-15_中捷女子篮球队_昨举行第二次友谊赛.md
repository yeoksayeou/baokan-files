    Sino-Czech Women's Basketball Team
    Holds Second Friendly Match Yesterday

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Czechoslovakian National Women's Basketball Team, known for its fast breaks, encountered the "August 1st" Women's Basketball Team, also renowned for its fast breaks, in their second friendly match held at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 14th. The result of the match was 77 to 58, with the Czech team winning.

      The "August 1st" team adopted an offensive tactic of "eight" shaped cuts and mid-range shots from the start, but their shooting accuracy was insufficient. In the second quarter, the "August 1st" team narrowed its defensive range, with the center providing very strict protection under the basket. Right forward Ge Li, number nine, and guard Xu Min, number three, adopted fast breaks, continuously cutting in for layups and scoring, gradually closing the point difference, closing to 29 to 31. In the second half, both sides actively launched fast attacks, and the score difference narrowed to only one point six times. However, in the final quarter, several key players of the "August 1st" team were fouled out five times, greatly weakening their offensive power, and ultimately losing to the Czech National Team with a score of 58 to 77.

    中捷女子篮球队
    昨举行第二次友谊赛
    本报讯　善于快攻的捷克斯洛伐克国家女子篮球队，十四日晚在北京体育馆举行的第二次友谊比赛中，遇到了也是以快攻著称的“八一”女子篮球队。比赛结果七十七对五十八，捷队获胜。
      “八一”队一上场就采用“八”字切入和中距离投篮的进攻战术，但是投篮不够准确。第二节“八一”队缩小了防守范围，中锋保护篮下十分谨严。右锋九号葛莉和后卫三号许敏采取快攻，接连切入上篮得分，使双方分差逐渐接近，直追到二十九比三十一。下半时双方都积极展开快速进攻，比分曾六次接近到只差一分。但在最后一节“八一”队的几个主力队员都因五次犯规下场，进攻力量大大削弱，终以五十八比七十七输给捷国家队。
