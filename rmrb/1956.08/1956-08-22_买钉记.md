    Buying Nails
    Zhao Wenhai
    Not long ago, I took advantage of a Sunday to change my paper windows to screen windows, and I needed to buy some nails to make a roller blind. I hurried to Wanqinggong Hardware Store in Beijing. There were two rows of counters, east and west. The west counter was crowded with customers, but there was no one at the east counter. I went to the east counter and asked to buy nails, but I ran into a "nail" – "Please go to the west side to buy them!"
    I was very surprised: why is one side busy and the other idle in the same store? It turned out that after the public-private partnership, this hardware store implemented a system of selling goods at separate counters, supposedly for competitive "convenience." I had to abide by their system and join the queue on the west side, watching the clerk on the west side sweating profusely while the clerk on the east counter sat idly.
    Finally, it was my turn to buy something. I immediately put the two fen I had prepared on the table. Unexpectedly, I hit another "nail." According to their "minimum purchase" system, they wouldn't sell two fen worth of nails. No matter what kind of nails, you had to buy at least one liang [50 grams]. The clerk explained to me: "Because it is a public-private partnership, we need to take inventory every day. If we don't sell nails in units of one liang or more, it's inconvenient to take inventory, so we must sell them by the liang." I had to abide by their system again and bought enough nails to make roller blinds for four years. I took out a jiao [10 fen] and asked the clerk to hurry up and give me the change. That wasn't possible. There was another system that had to be followed – issuing an invoice. I said I didn't need one, but that wasn't allowed. The clerk issued the invoice and explained, "Before the partnership, it wasn't so troublesome. Now the enterprise is standardized. For the convenience of evening statistics, every customer must have an invoice issued. It's easier now than it was a while ago! Before, we had to issue an invoice for each type of goods, which was even more troublesome." I was grateful to the clerk for the consolation.
    After completing this third set of procedures, I heaved a sigh of relief and left Wanqinggong Hardware Store. Holding a heavy bag of small nails that would last four years, and that useless invoice, I couldn't help but think: those people who sit in their offices making these rules, regardless of customer convenience, should also come and buy nails once to see what it's like.

    买钉记
    赵文海
    不久以前，我利用星期天把纸窗改为纱窗，需要买点钉子作个卷窗。急匆匆地走到北京万庆公五金行，这里有东西两排柜台，西面的柜台顾客拥挤，东面的却没有一个人，我就到东面柜台说要买钉子，没想到碰了个“钉子”——“请到西面去买吧！”
    我很奇怪：那边忙，这边闲，为什么一家店里会这样忙闲不均呢？原来这个五金行在公私合营后实行了分柜卖货的制度，据说是为了竞赛“便利”。我只好遵守他们的这个制度，到西面去排上队，看着西面柜台营业员忙的满头大汗，东柜台营业员却闲的坐着。
    好容易轮到我买东西了。我马上把早就准备好的二分钱放在桌上。不料又碰了一个“钉子”。根据他们的“起售点制度”，二分钱的钉子不卖。不论什么钉子，最少买一两。营业员向我解释着：“因为公私合营了，需要每天盘一次货，如果不卖一两以上的钉子，盘货就不方便，所以必须成两卖”。我只好再一次遵守他们的制度，买了足够四年做卷窗用的钉子。我拿出一角钱来，要求营业员快一点找钱。快不了，原来还有一项制度必须履行——开发票。我说不要也不行。营业员一面开发票，一面解释说：“合营前，用不着这么费事，现在企业正规化了，为了晚上统计方便，每位顾客都要开张发票，现在还比头些日子省事呢！前些时是一种货开一张发票，比现在更麻烦。”我很感激这位营业员对我的安慰。
    办完了这第三套手续后，我嘘了一口气离开了万庆公五金行。手里拿着一包沉甸甸的够四年用的小钉子，和那张没有用的发票，不禁想到：应该让那些不管顾客方便、坐在屋里订制度的人们，也来买一次钉子试试。
