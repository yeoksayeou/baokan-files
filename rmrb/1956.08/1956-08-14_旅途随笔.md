Travel Notes
By Our Correspondent, Weijin

In late June, I came to Xiantao, a large market town along the Han River. Every day, ships on the Hankou-Xiantao and Hankou-Shayang lines stop here. The leadership organs of Mianyang County are stationed here.

Active Rural Market

After the summer harvest, farmers rarely go to the market to buy things because they enter the busy season of strengthening cotton field management. The market seems quiet, but in reality, the sales of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private commercial enterprises in Xiantao Town are very good. Sales in April increased by 12.75% compared to the peak season of December last year; sales in May increased by 5.68% compared to the peak season of November last year, and it is estimated that sales in June will not decrease. The reason for the strong business is naturally due to the increased purchasing power of farmers after agricultural cooperativization. However, the direct reason is that commercial departments here criticized the "waiting for customers" business style not long ago, and thus actively delivered goods to the countryside. Since May, supply and marketing cooperatives have dispatched two to three hundred delivery teams to the countryside; supply and marketing cooperatives have also organized four to five thousand small vendors to go from village to village to deliver goods. These small vendors, with the help of the supply and marketing cooperatives and linked to the township governments, have generally gained the trust of farmers. Their daily turnover has increased from eight or nine yuan in the past to twenty or thirty yuan, with a maximum of more than fifty yuan.

Expanding the Purchase of Native and Special Products

The supply and marketing cooperatives here have begun to pay attention to the purchase of native and special products. Some time ago, they criticized erroneous ideas such as simply fearing stockpiling, losing money, and trouble. Now they have appropriately adjusted the purchase prices of native and special products, added more than ten purchasing outlets, and added a batch of purchasing personnel. In order to enable purchasing personnel to identify various product specifications and quality, and correctly implement the price policy of grading according to quality, the purchasing outlets in various places also held sample and price exhibitions for purchasing new varieties. Now the purchase of native and special products has increased from more than one hundred in the past to two to three hundred, and the purchase amount in early June increased by 40% compared to late May. The supply and marketing cooperatives combine the purchase of native and special products with the promotion of goods. Farmers are very satisfied with this. They said, "The 'market' is right outside the door, it's so convenient."

Completed Fertilizer Supply Plan

The supply and marketing cooperatives also actively tried to do a good job in fertilizer supply. In May, according to investigations in the countryside, 5.5 million jin of oil cake fertilizer were needed for cotton fields. However, the county's oil presses could only produce 3 million jin of oil cake fertilizer. The supply and marketing cooperatives then convened a meeting of production units (oil presses) and supply units (oil companies) to study this issue, and decided to tap the production potential of existing oil presses on the one hand, and restore some old oil presses on the other hand. Therefore, by the end of May, the supply plan for oil cake fertilizer was overfulfilled. After June, rice needed chemical fertilizer, but the supply and marketing cooperatives' inventory was far from meeting the needs of the countryside. They sent people to Songzi County to learn the method of making indigenous chemical fertilizer (namely, eight loads of manure, twenty-four jin of lime, four jin of Atractylodes lancea, plus twenty-four loads of water, sealed in a large vat for seven days, then add ninety to one hundred and thirty loads of water). The finished product has good fertilizer efficiency and is ready to be supplied in large quantities. Some agricultural cooperatives in some districts have also begun to try to make it themselves.

Satisfactory Development of Pig Raising

The development of pig raising in this area is satisfactory. At the beginning of the year, the party and government organs here paid attention to this work; from the county to the district and township, there were special personnel to lead the raising and purchase of pigs. In addition to earnestly publicizing the policy of assigning pig raising and purchase, and helping farmers to calculate the overall account and explain the benefits of raising pigs, more importantly, they solved many practical problems. First, adjust the source of pigs. Food companies and other units organized more than 60 small vendors to transport piglets from Maozui District (the main pig-producing area in the county) to the sales area for sale, and organized small vendors and agricultural cooperative members in the sales area to buy pigs in the production area, thereby overcoming the uneven distribution of pig sources. In addition, due to the reasonable adjustment of the price ratio of various pigs, appropriately reducing feed prices, and doing a good job in the prevention of pig diseases. The number of pigs in the county last year was only 8,700, which has increased to 41,408, including 12,360 sows. It is estimated that more than 120,000 piglets can be developed this year, which will exceed the plan of one pig per household.

Excessive and Heavy Taxation of Rural Sideline Occupations

At present, many agricultural cooperatives have begun to pay attention to developing diversified operations, but some aspects of the tax policy are still very unreasonable, thus frustrating the enthusiasm of farmers to develop diversified operations. Here, farmers collect snails, cut paper flowers, make reed mats, agricultural cooperative members go out to work as carpenters and tilers, and the flour residue and flour water from flour mills must be taxed. There are many lakes here. The county has 1,100 duck farmers with 13,000 yuan in funds, but the tax payment reaches 11,000 yuan, an average of 60 yuan in tax per hundred ducks, frustrating the enthusiasm of farmers to raise ducks. In Fengqiao Township, the tax paid by the Qunli Agricultural Cooperative for burning kilns accounts for 80% of the total income, and the kiln was closed due to losses. Such unreasonable taxation hinders the development of diversified operations and also affects the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the development of production. If production cannot be developed, how can national income be increased? These taxes are mainly the financial plans formulated by local financial organs, which do not take into account the possibilities, but only emphasize needs. As a result, the financial plans are too large, and in order to complete their tasks, the tax authorities have to blindly increase tax items and increase tax rates.

    旅途随笔
    本报记者　维进
    六月下旬，我来到仙桃，这是汉水沿岸一座较大的集镇。每天，有汉口仙桃班和汉口沙洋班的轮船在这里停泊。沔阳县的领导机关驻在这里。
    农村市场活跃
    夏收之后，农民由于进入了加强棉田管理的忙碌季节，很少上集买东西，市场似乎清淡，实际上仙桃镇的国营、合作社和公私合营商业的销货情况很好。四月份销货金额比去年旺季十二月份增加12.75％；五月份的销货金额比去年旺季十一月份增加5.68％，估计六月份的销货金额也不会降低。营业旺盛的原因，自然是由于农业合作化以后，农民的购买力提高，但是，直接的原因，是不久以前这里的商业部门批判了“等客上门”的经营作风，从而积极送货下乡。从五月份以来，由供销社派人送货下乡的就有二、三百个送货小组；供销社还组织小商小贩四五千人串乡送货。这些小商小贩经过供销社的帮助和乡政权挂钩，一般都取得了农民的信任，他们每天的营业额由过去的八九元增加到二、三十元，最多达五十多元。
    扩大土特产品的收购
    这里的供销社对于土特产品的收购已经引起重视。前些日子，他们批判了单纯怕积压、怕赔本、怕麻烦等错误思想。现在他们适当调整了土特产品的收购价格，增设了十多个收购门市部，增添了一批收购人员。为了使收购人员能鉴定各种产品规格、质量，正确执行按等论价的价格政策，各地的收购门市部还举行了收购新品种的样品、价格展览。现在收购的土特产品已由过去的一百多种增加到二三百种，六月上旬的收购金额比五月下旬增加40％。供销社收购土特产品是和推销商品结合进行的。农民对这很满意。他们说：“出了门口就是‘街’，太方便了。”
    完成了供肥计划
    供销社还积极设法做好肥料供  应工作。五月份，根据在农村摸底，需要供应棉田的饼肥五百五十万斤，可是，全县的榨坊只能生产饼肥三百万斤。供销社于是召集生产单位（榨坊）和供应单位（油脂公司）开会研究这个问题，决定一方面挖掘现有榨坊的生产潜力，一方面恢复一些旧榨坊，因此在五月底，超额完成了饼肥的供应计划。六月份以后，水稻需要用化学肥料，而供销社库存远不能满足农村的需要。他们派人到松滋县学习土制化学肥料的方法（即便粪八担，石灰二十四斤，苍术四斤，加水二十四担，用大毛缸封闭七天，再加水九十——一百三十担），制成品肥效良好，准备大量供应。有些区的农业合作社并开始自行试制。
    发展生猪情况令人满意
    这一带地区发展生猪的情况令人满意。年初，这里的党政机关就重视了这项工作；从县到区乡都有专人领导生猪的养购。他们除了认真宣传生猪派养派购的政策，和帮助农民算大账，说明养猪的好处外，更重要的是解决了许多实际问题。首先调剂猪源，食品公司等单位组织小商小贩六十多人到毛嘴区（全县产猪的主要地区）运仔猪到销地出售，并组织了销地的小商小贩和农业合作社员到产地买猪，由此克服了猪源分布不平衡的状态。此外，由于合理调整各种猪的比价，适当降低饲料价格，做好猪病的预防等工作。使全县去年仅有生猪八千七百头，增加到四万一千四百零八头，其中母猪一万二千三百六十头，预计今年还可发展仔猪十二万多头，将超过每户喂一头猪的规划。
    农村副业的税收过多过重
    目前有许多农业合作社开始重视开展多种经营，但是税收政策的某些方面仍然很不合理，因而挫折了农民开展多种经营的积极性。这里的农民摸螺丝，剪纸花，打芦席，农业社员出外做木、瓦工，粉坊的粉渣粉水等都要纳税。这里的湖泊多，全县有鸭民一千一百户，资金一万三千元，但是完税额即达一万一千元，平均每百头鸭子纳税六十元。挫折了农民养鸭的积极性。在冯桥乡，群力农业合作社烧窑纳税占总收益的80％，烧窑赔本关了门。这样不合理的收税，结果是妨碍了多种经营的发展，也影响农业社的巩固和生产的发展，生产不能发展，又何从增加国家收入呢？这些税收主要是地方财政机关制定的财政规划，不根据可能，只强调需要；结果财政规划过大，税收机关为了完成任务，便不得不盲目增加税收项目和提高税率。
