Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 23rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sha Yin reports): Since the beginning of this year, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has affected the production of more than 100 ordering units because it has not supplied steel according to the contract. In July, the factory did not deliver a single ton of alloy steel that should have been delivered to the ordering units. The number of high-quality steel plates delivered was only 54% of the amount stipulated in the contract. The high-quality steel ingots delivered to the ordering units were only 41.4% of the amount stipulated in the contract. In June, twenty-five units across the country ordered high-quality steel and steel products from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and ten of them did not receive the goods they should have received.

Due to the failure to perform the contract, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant paid more than 14,000 yuan in fines in the first half of this year, and another more than 110,000 yuan in fines should be paid but have not been paid.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's failure to deliver orders according to the contract has caused losses to the production of many ordering units. At the same time, the failure to deliver orders has also caused the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's own plans to fall through. The factory failed to complete its profit target for the first half of the year.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant began producing high-quality steel in large quantities this year. Based on the factory's equipment, technical level, management level and other conditions, this year's production needs to be arranged in advance. However, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant still arranged this year's production, technology, management and sales work according to the requirements of producing ordinary steel, and did not solve the special technical and equipment problems that need to be solved for the production of high-quality steel. Therefore, a passive state of production has been created, and the production plan of high-quality steel plate cannot be completed. When producing certain high-quality steels, the usual procedure of trial production, small-batch trial production, and batch trial production before being formally put into production is not followed. Instead, mass production is planned immediately after the trial production is successful. As a result, new technical and equipment problems brought about by mass formal production have not been resolved, and some products, although included in the plan and orders accepted, cannot be produced.

Many practical and feasible contracts signed between the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and related units also failed to be delivered due to the low quality of the products, even though they were produced.

The poor quality of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's products is a long-standing problem, but it has never been resolved with determination. Some problems could have been solved, but they were delayed due to the leadership's lack of attention. For example, the short length problem of forged steel has not been solved from the equipment and technical point of view for a long time, so that there is still a batch of short length steel that cannot be processed. Low quality has resulted in a large number of unplanned products. According to the June production plan, the factory sold 166 tons of No. 20 steel plate, but because the decarbonization problem of the product was not solved, most of the products were downgraded to No. 15 steel plate due to poor quality. Only 28 tons of No. 20 steel plate were produced. As a result, the order for No. 20 steel plate was not delivered. Due to the production of a large number of unplanned products, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has experienced a distorted phenomenon: on the one hand, a large number of orders are overdue, and on the other hand, more than 1,000 tons of steel are stockpiled.

In addition, the sales department and the production department are not well coordinated. In the sales contract for steel ingots, the extra requirement of the ordering unit to do a dissection test for each batch was accepted. As a result, the steel ingots were produced, but they could not be delivered because they could not be dissected. In some cases, the sales department did not notify the production department of the products that had been sold, and the production department did not arrange production, so they could not be delivered on time.

Of course, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has its objective reasons for failing to deliver orders according to the contract. For example, due to the tight steel supply this year, many products have production difficulties, and some orders, although very small in quantity, have to be accepted reluctantly, so that some products cannot be delivered on time or cannot be delivered at all.

Now, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has begun to take measures to change this situation. However, judging from the current situation, it has become a foregone conclusion that some ordering units of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant will not be able to fully obtain the steel they urgently need this year.

### 太原钢铁厂不按合同交货  一百多个单位的生产受影响

    太原钢铁厂不按合同交货
    一百多个单位的生产受影响
    新华社太原23日电　新华社记者莎荫报道：今年以来，太原钢铁厂因为没有按照合同供应钢材，使一百多个订货单位的生产受到了影响。七月份，这个厂应该交给订货单位的合金钢，一吨也没有交出去。优质钢板的交货数量只等于合同规定的数量的54％。交给订货单位的优质钢锭也只等于合同规定数量的41.4％。六月份全国有二十五个单位向太原钢铁厂订购了优质钢和钢材，其中有十个单位没有拿到他们应该拿到的订货。
    由于没有执行合同，太原钢铁厂今年上半年付出的罚金就有一万四千多元，另外还有十一万多元应该付出的罚金没有付出去。
    太原钢铁厂不能按照合同交出订货，使许多订货单位的生产遭受到损失。同时，因为交不出订货也使得太原钢铁厂本身的计划落空了。这个厂上半年的上缴利润指标没有完成。
    太原钢铁厂是今年开始大量生产优质钢的。根据这个厂的设备、技术水平和管理水平等条件，今年的生产都需要提早安排。然而，太原钢铁厂却仍然按照生产普通钢的要求安排了今年的生产、技术、管理和推销工作，没有解决生产优质钢所要求解决的特殊的技术、设备问题。因此，就造成了生产上的被动状态，优质钢板的生产完不成计划。在生产某些优质钢的时候，也不是按照试制、小批试制、成批试制以后，再列入计划进行正式生产的这种通常程序进行，而是试制成功就列入计划大量生产，结果由于大批正式生产所带来的新的技术上和设备上的问题没有解决，一些产品虽然列入计划，也接受了订货，却生产不出来。
    太原钢铁厂和有关单位签订的许多切实可行的合同，也由于产品质量低劣，虽然生产出来也交不了货。
    太原钢铁厂产品低劣是一个长期存在的问题，但是始终没有下决心解决过。有些问题本来是可以解决的，也因为领导方面没有重视而拖延下来。如锻钢材的短尺问题，长时期以来没有从设备和技术上加以解决，以致到现在还有一批短尺钢材无法处理。质量不高，就造成了大量非计划产品。这个厂根据六月份的生产计划推销出去的一百六十六吨二十号钢板，由于没有解决产品的脱炭问题，结果绝大部分产品都因为质量低劣而降为十五号钢板，二十号钢板只生产了二十八吨。这样，二十号钢板的订货便没有交出去。由于生产了大量非计划产品，太原钢铁厂便出现了这样一种畸形现象：一方面是大量订货欠交，同时又积压了一千多吨钢材。
    此外，推销部门和生产部门也配合得不好。在推销钢锭的合同中，接受了订货单位的每批都作解剖试验的额外要求，结果钢锭生产出来了，却因为不能解剖而交不了货。有的因为推销部门没有把推销出去的产品通知生产部门，生产部门没有布置生产，也就不能按期交货。
    太原钢铁厂不能按合同交出订货，当然也有它的客观原因，如由于今年钢材紧张，许多产品生产上有困难，有些订货数量虽然很小，也只得勉强接受下来，以致使某些产品不能按期交货或根本不能交货。
    现在，太原钢铁厂已经开始采取措施改变这种状况。但是，从目前的情况看来，今年太原钢铁厂的一部分订货单位不能完全得到他们急需要的钢材，已经成为定局了。
