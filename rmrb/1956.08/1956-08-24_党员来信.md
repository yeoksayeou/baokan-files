Party Member Letters

    Overcome this Closed-Door Tendency
    Editor:
        The Party organization of the Jinhua Textile Factory in Yuci, Shanxi Province, does not pay enough attention to Party organizational construction. This factory is a large factory with several thousand employees, but the current number of Party members only accounts for a few percent of the total number, and most of these Party members are cadres. Among them, there are more than eighty probationary Party members. Except for a few probationary Party members who do not meet the requirements for becoming formal Party members, most of them should be transferred to formal Party members in a timely manner. However, this has not been resolved for a long time, and some have been delayed for three or four years. Not only can probationary Party members not be transferred to formal members on time, but also the work of developing the Party has completely stopped. No new Party members have been developed in the past two years. Obviously, this is a closed-door tendency and it is time to correct it quickly. 　Sima Ming

    Adjust Party Organizations After the Merger of Districts and Townships
    Editor:
        Since this year, many places have carried out the work of merging districts and townships. However, in some places, after the district-level organs were abolished, the Party organizations also became disorganized. Party members of some units such as district supply and marketing cooperatives have not participated in organizational activities or paid Party dues for two or three months, and the work of developing Party members and transferring probationary Party members to full members has also stalled. For example, probationary Party members such as She Wuyu Yi of the former Baisha District Society in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, have exceeded their probationary period by more than three months and do not know where to go to complete the procedures for becoming full members. Another example is that five Party members from three or four units in the former Qingfeng District, who were originally compiled into a branch with the district office, have not yet established a branch and have not participated in organizational activities. It is hoped that the Xinhua County Party Committee will solve this problem quickly. 　Zheng Xuanyuan

    Pay Attention to Party Members Among Primary School Teachers
    Editor:
        I joined the Communist Party of China in July last year and also graduated from Changle Junior Normal School in Fujian in July. After graduation, I was sent by the Changle County Education Section (formerly the Culture and Education Section) to teach at the Yingqian Central Primary School (where the district office is located) in this county. Because I was the only Party member among the primary school teachers at that time, there was no Party organization. Therefore, when I was about to be sent to the school, I talked to Comrade Lin Tao, the introducer, about the issue of participating in organizational activities in the future. He said to me that it is best to transfer the organizational relationship to the District Committee and get in touch with the District Committee. On August 28, I arrived at the school and immediately transferred my organizational relationship to the Yingqian District Committee. The District Committee Secretary was not there at the time, only Comrade Wu Kongyan, the District Committee Secretary, was seen. After I transferred the relationship, I took the initiative to ask him to give more opinions and help in the future work, and asked him to introduce the ideological and political situation of the teachers in the school. He said, "I don't know much about it and there is nothing to introduce." That's it. What I hope most is to be able to participate in organizational activities frequently, and under the direct education and help of the Party, my political and ideological level can be improved more quickly and work better. However, day after day, month after month, until December when I was transferred away from the school, I did not participate in organizational activities once in more than three months.
    Since this year, the Party ranks have been expanding continuously, and many Party members have also been developed among primary school teachers. However, most primary schools still cannot independently establish branches or Party groups, and still need to participate in organizational activities in the local Party committee or Party branch. If the Yingqian District Committee does not pay attention to the education of Party members among primary school teachers in this way, even if they join the Party, they will not receive the Party's education and help. Therefore, I hope that Party organizations in various places should pay attention to and care about the education of Party members among primary school teachers. 　Li Fanan

### 党员来信

专栏：党员来信

    党员来信
    克服这种关门主义倾向编辑同志：
    山西榆次晋华纺织厂的党组织对党的组织建设很不重视。这个厂是一个拥有好几千名职工的大厂，但是现有党员人数只占总人数的百分之几，并且这些党员大部分是干部。其中有候补党员八十多人，除了个别候补党员不合乎转为正式党员的条件外，大部分的人都应该及时转为正式党员，可是，却长期不得解决，有的甚至拖了三四年还不能转正。不但候补党员不能按时转正，发展党的工作也完全停止了，近两年来一个新党员也没有发展。显然，这是一种关门主义倾向，是赶快纠正的时候了。　司马明
    撤区并乡后要调整党组织编辑同志：
    今年以来，很多地方都进行了撤区并乡的工作。但是，有的地方区级机关撤销以后，党组织也跟着涣散了。有的区供销社等单位的党员们两三个月未过组织生活和无处缴纳党费，有的单位的发展党员和候补党员转正的工作也停顿下来。例如，湖南省新化县原白沙区社伍玉怡等候补党员候补期已经超过三个多月了，不知道到那里去办转正的手续。又如原青峰区三、四个单位的五个党员，原来是同区公所合编在一个支部的，现在还未成立支部，也没有过组织生活。这个问题，希望新化县委赶快解决。　郑选源
    重视小学教师中的党员编辑同志：
    我是去年七月加入中国共产党的，同时也是七月由福建长乐初级师范学校毕业的。毕业后，就由长乐县教育科（前文教科）派到本县营前中心小学（区公所所在地）任教员。因为当时小学教师中只有我一个人是党员，还没有党组织。因此，当快要派到学校去的时候，我就找介绍人林涛同志谈今后过组织生活的问题。他对我说，最好是把组织关系转到区委会去，与区委取得联系。八月二十八日到了学校，我立即把组织关系转到营前区委会。当时区委书记不在，只看到区委秘书吴孔炎同志，我转好关系后，就主动要求他今后在工作中多提意见和帮助，并要求他介绍学校中的教师思想和政治情况，他说：“我了解得不清楚，没有什么好介绍。”这也算了。我最希望的是能够经常过组织生活，在党的直接教育和帮助下，使我的政治思想水平能够更快提高，更好地工作。但是，一天盼一天，一月盼一月，一直到十二月份我工作调动离开了学校，三个多月中，没有过一次组织生活。
    今年以来，党的队伍不断扩大，小学教师中也发展了不少党员。但现在小学中绝大部分还不能单独成立支部或党小组，仍需要在学校当地的党委或党支部过组织生活，如果再像营前区委这样不重视对小学教师中党员的教育工作，他们虽然入了党也是得不到党的教育和帮助的。所以，我希望各地党组织，应该重视和关心对小学教师中党员的教育工作。　李发南
