Overcoming Natural Disasters and Strengthening Field Management
Cotton Grows Well in Xinjiang Jinan and Other Places

    (Our report) The more than 200,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River Basin reclamation area of Xinjiang now largely possess the conditions for a bumper harvest: retaining around 7,000 cotton plants per mu; less boll shedding than in any previous year; by mid-July, superior plants had eleven or twelve fruit branches with eight or nine flowers already blooming, and average plants had eight or nine branches with four or five flowers already blooming. This year, during the cotton seedling development period, the Manas River Basin experienced three hailstorms, and the temperature was three degrees Celsius lower than the same period last year for about forty days. At that time, in response to these climatic characteristics, each cotton planting unit earnestly implemented measures such as more cultivation, deep cultivation, and early application of fertilizer in stages and layers, maintaining and increasing soil temperature, allowing most of the cotton to develop and grow normally under adverse climatic conditions. In early August, the cotton here underwent its second pruning. Recently, each cotton planting unit is carrying out a campaign to protect seedlings and bolls in the later stages, strengthening the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and ensuring appropriate irrigation.

    (Our report) After strengthening field management and overcoming weeds and insect pests, the 3.87 million mu of cotton fields in the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province are generally growing well. Since early June, due to continuous rain and the intensity of the summer harvest, weeds and insect pests in many cotton fields have taken the opportunity to spread. In order to rescue the affected cotton fields within a limited time, the Jinan Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party appropriately arranged the work of strengthening cotton field management at the rural work department meeting of various counties held in early July. Thanks to the efforts of various counties, by the end of July, weeds and insect pests in the 3.87 million mu of cotton fields throughout the district had been basically cleared. During the crash program of weeding and eliminating insect pests in cotton fields, counties, townships, and communes across the district dispatched a large number of cadres to help cooperatives or production teams of each commune to rationally organize the use of labor. Jieyu and Anyi counties alone dispatched 671 cadres.
    Currently, the cotton in the entire district is generally growing well, with an average plant height of 1.5 to 2 chi (approximately 50-67 cm), each plant having seven to fourteen fruit branches, three to five cotton bolls, and about ten flower buds and young bolls. At present, farmers throughout the district are busily removing superfluous buds and pinching the top growth, further strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields, and striving for a bumper cotton harvest. (Wang Degui Wang Chunyuan)

    (Our report) The more than 280,000 mu of Dai character cotton in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, is growing well. On both banks of the Ju River and Dao River, in the dense cotton fields, red and white flowers are blooming, and plump cotton bolls have grown near the roots of the fruit branches.
    On July 27, the county organized for the first time thirty-nine representatives from thirteen major cotton-producing townships, divided into three groups to conduct a major inspection of the cotton in each township, and selected Dadu, Bali, and Liuji townships as model cotton planting townships, and mutually proposed many opinions on the late-stage management of cotton, and launched activities to protect buds, flowers, and bolls.
    The members of the Xinghuo No. 2 Cooperative in Wangji Township learned the advanced Soviet fertilization methods, bought 1,200 jin of superphosphate, and implemented foliar fertilization to protect the existing flower buds and cotton bolls.
    In Dadu Township, a model cotton planting township, farmers paid special attention to preventing and controlling late-stage cotton pests. During the day, more than 1,400 people sprayed pesticide powder in the fields, and at night, there were often 8-9 youth shock teams who sprayed pesticide powder to eliminate insects while the dew was present.
    Qinlao No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative has a total of 1,538 mu of cotton, of which 148 mu are third-class seedlings. The cooperative adopted the method of focused fertilization, supplementing the third-class seedlings and first and second-class seedlings, so that they could catch up with the large seedlings. Chen Chaowang, the deputy director, was specially assigned to lead the whole cooperative to eliminate the third-class seedlings, and the production team leaders personally led this work. Now the third-class seedlings in the cooperative have changed, with more than 60 mu catching up with the first-class seedlings, and more than 80 mu catching up with the second-class seedlings. The small seedlings in the original first and second-class seedling fields have also caught up with the large seedlings.

    战胜自然灾害　加强田间管理
    新疆晋南等地棉花长得好
    本报讯　新疆玛纳斯河流域垦区二十多万亩棉花，现已大部具有决定丰产的条件：每亩棉株保留七千株左右；落蕾比以往任何一年都少；至七月中旬，上等植株的果枝有十一、二个，已开花八、九朵，中等植株的果枝有八、九枝，已开花四、五朵。今年正当棉苗发育期间，玛纳斯河流域曾降冰雹三次，在约四十天时间内，气温较去年同一时期低摄氏三度。当时，各植棉单位根据这些气候的特点，认真实行了多中耕、深中耕和提早分期、分层追肥等措施，保持和增加了地温，使大部分棉花在气候恶劣的情况下能够正常发育生长。八月初，这里的棉花已进行了第二次整枝。最近各植棉单位正开展后期的保苗保铃运动，加强防治病虫害和做到适量的灌溉。　　（陈誉）
    本报讯　山西省晋南专区387万亩棉田经过加强田间管理，战胜草荒虫害后，普遍生长良好。自六月上旬以来，由于霪雨连绵和夏收紧张，许多棉田中的杂草、害虫乘机蔓延起来。为了限期抢救被害的棉田，中共晋南地方委员会在七月上旬召开的各县农村工作部长会议上适当地安排了加强棉田管理的工作，经过各县的努力，截至七月底，全区387万亩棉田里的杂草、害虫已基本上清除干净。在突击棉田除草、消灭虫害中，全区各县、乡、社都抽出大批干部，帮助各合作社或各社的生产队合理地组织使用劳力。仅解虞、安邑两县抽出的干部就有671人。
    目前全区的棉花普遍生长良好，一般株高一尺五寸到二尺，每株有果枝七到十四个，棉桃三到五个，花蕾、花铃十个左右。现在，全区农民正在紧张地进行去赘芽、打群尖，进一步加强棉田的后期管理，争取棉花丰收。　　　　　（王德贵　王春元）
    本报讯　湖北省新洲县二十八万余亩岱字棉花，生长良好。在举水和倒水两岸，密茂的棉田里，盛开着红白相间的花朵，靠近根部的果枝，已长出了肥硕的棉桃。
    七月二十七日，全县第一次组织了十三个主要棉产乡的三十九个代表，分三片对各乡的棉花进行了一次大检查，评出了大渡、八里、刘集三个乡为植棉模范乡，并相互提出了很多棉花后期管理的意见，开展保蕾、保花、保桃活动。
    汪集乡星火二社的社员们，学习了苏联的先进施肥方法，买回了一千二百斤过磷酸钙，实行根外追肥，保全已经出现的花蕾和棉桃。
    在植棉模范乡大渡乡里，农民们特别注意防治棉花后期虫害，白天有一千四百多人在田里喷射药粉，夜里也经常有8—9个青年突击队，趁着露水喷撒药粉除虫。
    勤劳第一农业社，全社1，538亩棉花，其中有三类苗148亩。社内采取了重点追肥的办法，补施了三类苗和一、二类苗，使它们赶上大苗。社内特别抽出副主任陈超旺，统一领导全社消灭三类苗，各生产队长都亲自领导这一工作。现在社内的三类苗都变样了，有六十余亩赶上了一类苗，有八十余亩赶上了二类苗，原来一、二类苗地中的小苗，也都赶上了大苗。
