    Ministry of Forestry Holds Symposium
    to Study Forestry Protection Science and Technology Issues

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Ministry of Forestry recently held a symposium on forestry protection and fire prevention science and technology in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions. Participants included representatives from forestry science research departments, higher forestry schools, meteorological departments, and forestry bureaus and key forest area forest management organizations from the three provinces (regions) of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia.

    At the meeting, representatives from the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Academy of Forestry Science, and the Beijing Forestry Institute presented special reports on the experimental research work on fire danger weather forecasting, chemical fire suppression, and fire prevention technical facilities in operating areas in the Northeast forest region over the past two years.

    After listening to the report from the Forest Management Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry on strengthening forestry protection and fire prevention technical facilities in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions, the meeting focused on discussing long-term planning issues such as building highways in the Greater Khingan, Lesser Khingan, Changbai Mountain, and Wanda Mountain forest areas, strengthening aerial forest protection and communication equipment, opening firebreaks and sterile soil zones, establishing chemical fire extinguishing stations, and establishing fire danger weather forecasting networks. The participants particularly emphasized the issue of highway construction in forest areas, believing that it should be combined with the overall highway plans of relevant provinces and strive to complete the construction of main lines within two or three years to ensure the transportation of firefighters and the supply of materials to grassroots forestry management organizations in the future.

    In order to meet the urgent needs of forestry protection and fire prevention work, forestry science research departments will further study the fire resistance of forest ground cover, use semiconductors to measure forest flammability, and use helicopters to extinguish forest fires.

    林业部召开座谈会
    研究护林科学技术问题
    本报讯　林业部最近召开了东北、内蒙古地区护林防火科学技术座谈会。参加会议的有林业科学研究部门，高等林业学校，气象部门，黑龙江、吉林、内蒙三省（区）的林业厅和重点林区的森林经营机构的代表。
    会上，中国科学院林业土壤研究所、中央林业科学研究所、北京林学院等单位的代表，就两年来东北林区的火灾危险天气预报、化学扑灭火灾及施业区防火技术设施等问题的试验研究工作，提出了专题报告。
    在听取了林业部森林经营局关于加强东北、内蒙地区护林防火技术设施意见的报告后，着重讨论了大小兴安岭、长白山和完达山林区修建公路，加强航空护林和通讯设备，开辟防火线和生土带，设立化学灭火站和火灾危险天气预报网等长远规划问题。与会者特别重视林区公路的修建问题，认为应该结合有关省的公路总体规划，争取二、三年内完成主要干线的修建任务，以保证今后救火人员的交通运输和基层林业经营机构的物质供应。
    为了满足护林防火工作的迫切需要，今后林业科学研究部门，将进一步研究森林地被物抗火性能，利用半导体测定森林燃烧性和利用直升飞机扑灭森林火灾等问题。
