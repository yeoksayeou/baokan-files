    Egyptian People Will Not Be Intimidated by Force
    Editor's Note: The newspaper continues to receive many letters from readers, unanimously supporting Egypt's action to reclaim the Suez Canal. Due to space limitations, we have selected a small portion to publish here. Reader Forum: Britain Should Immediately Cease Armed Provocations
    The Egyptian people, reasonably and legally, nationalized the Suez Canal, which they built with their own hands and which belongs to them, declaring that they would respect the freedom of navigation on the canal and were prepared to compensate the shareholders of the company. We see no reason whatsoever for the British government to be so angry as to shout this and that: ordering the armed forces to stand by, entering a state of "alert," ready to "take action" at any time – brazenly displaying the face of a colonialist.
    Seeing this news, my indignant heart could not calm down for a long time.
    The heroic actions of the Egyptian people have aroused deep sympathy from peace-loving people around the world and from the Asian and African people who have suffered deeply from colonialist exploitation and oppression. In particular, the Arab countries, which are closely linked, have repeatedly made firm statements. If Western colonialism dares to violate human justice and international norms and provoke war, they will not only bear full responsibility for the criminal act of undermining world peace but will also reap what they sow. The Egyptian people, who have stood up, have the support of the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving countries around the world and cannot be intimidated.

       Cool Down, Colonialists!
    The Egyptian people have nationalized the Suez Canal Company! What an inspiring news! But Western colonialists are clamoring for armed intervention and putting their troops on "alert" so they can take military action at any time. Isn't that a bit too uncool and neurotic? Reclaiming the canal is an internal affair of the Egyptian people. If the colonialists insist on making trouble and creating international tensions, it will only cause them to suffer losses in their own interests in this region. Haven't they heard President Nasser say "Repel force with force..."? This is the heartfelt voice of the people of a country that has already gained independence and freedom. Any force is powerless in front of them. Shenyang He Yongmian
          The Egyptian People Will Surely Triumph
    I am a sixth-grade student. In geography class, the teacher talked about an independent country in Africa – Egypt.
    Egypt is located in the lower reaches of the Nile River and is one of the oldest countries in the world. It was ruled by British imperialism for decades. After World War II, the Egyptian people launched a revolutionary movement against imperialism and for national liberation. Now the Egyptian people have truly become independent.
    The Suez Canal in Egypt used to be occupied by imperialists. Now I see in the People's Daily that the Egyptian people have announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and I am very happy. This is another great victory for the Egyptian people in their struggle against imperialism and for national independence.
    Colonialists who are dreaming sweet dreams, wake up! The Egyptian people will never be intimidated by your shameless threats. You will fail.

### 埃及人民不会被武力威胁吓倒

    埃及人民不会被武力威胁吓倒
    编者按：本报继续收到了许多读者的来信，一致支持埃及收回苏彝士运河的行动。因为限于篇幅，我们选登了一小部分在这里。读者论坛英国应该立即停止武装挑衅
    埃及人民合情合法地将自己亲手建筑的属于自己的苏彝士运河收归国有，并声明保证尊重在运河通航的自由，还准备偿付这家公司股票持有者的股金。我们完全看不出这里面有任何理由足以惹起英国政府的如此恼怒，竟至叫嚷着要这样要那样：命令三军待令，进入“戒备状态”，随时“采取行动”。——赤裸裸地摆出一付殖民主义者的面孔。
    看到这种消息，我愤怒的心久久不能平静下来。
    埃及人民的英勇行动，已经引起了全世界爱好和平的人民和深受殖民主义剥削与压迫之苦的亚非人民的深刻同情。特别是休戚相关的阿拉伯国家，它们都一再作出了坚决的表示。如果西方殖民主义竟敢违反人类正义与国际准则，挑起战争的话，它们不仅要对破坏世界和平的罪恶行为负全部责任，而且将自食其果。站起来了的埃及人民，有着亚非各国人民和世界爱好和平国家人民的支持，是吓不倒的。
    殖民主义者们，请清醒一些吧！　天津　林江
       冷静点吧，殖民主义者！
    埃及人民把苏彝士运河公司收归国有了，这是多么令人振奋的消息！但是西方殖民主义者却在叫嚷要进行武装干涉，并使自己的军队进入“戒备状态”，以便到时采取军事行动，这未免太不冷静和神经质了吧。收回运河是埃及人民内政问题，如果殖民主义者硬要借端生事，制造国际紧张局势，那只能使他们自己在这一个地区的利益遭受损失。他们难道没有听到纳赛尔总统说的“以武力击退武力……”的话吗？这是已经获得独立自由的国家人民的心声，任何武力在他们面前是无能为力的。　　沈阳　何永绵
          埃及人民一定会胜利
    我是一个六年级的学生，在地理课上老师曾经讲过非洲的独立国家——埃及。
    埃及在尼罗河的下游，是世界上最古老的国家之一。它被英帝国主义统治了几十年，第二次世界大战后埃及人民掀起反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的革命运动，现在埃及人民已经真正独立了。
    埃及的苏彝士运河，以前被帝国主义占领着。现在我在人民日报上看到埃及人民宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有，非常高兴，这是埃及人民反对帝国主义斗争、争取民族独立的又一个大胜利。
    正在做着甜蜜的梦的殖民主义者清醒吧！埃及人民决不会被你们那种无耻的恐吓所吓倒，你们是会失败的。
