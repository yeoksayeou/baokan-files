    Railway System Promotes 107 Major Advanced Experiences

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Since the National Railway Advanced Producers Representative Conference, in order to consolidate the achievements of the conference and give play to the spirit of "mutual learning, mutual help, learning from each other's strengths, and common improvement," the Ministry of Railways organized various advanced experience demonstration groups, dispatched to various places to spread advanced experience. Statistics from the six bureaus under its jurisdiction show that nine bureau chiefs and section chiefs, twenty-nine engineers, and seventy-five advanced producers went deep into various lines, promoting a total of 107 major advanced experiences. More than 20,000 railway workers heard the lectures or visited the demonstration performances.

    The promotion of these advanced experiences has played a significant role in comprehensively completing the transportation plan and accelerating the progress of the project. The locomotive department implemented the registered locomotive turnaround chart, strengthening the planning of various links on the railway. The number of locomotives achieved in early July accounted for 41.8% of the total planned, and reached 46.1% in mid-July. Due to the promotion of Li Shaoqiang and Sun Shigui's coal-saving experience, a total of 32,152 tons of coal for locomotives were saved in the first half of this year. After the commercial department promoted the methods of mixing light and heavy goods, mechanical disassembly loading, and loading without pillars, it not only greatly improved the net weight of vehicles, but also saved a lot of timber for the country. The promotion of cement-saving experience in the new line department alone can save the Third Engineering Bureau 4,000 tons of cement throughout the year. There are also many advanced experiences in other public works, vehicle, and electrical departments.

    The reason why the Ministry of Railways' promotion of advanced experience this time has been so effective is mainly because the leaders took the lead in going deep into the lower levels and specifically organized the promotion, which mobilized everyone's enthusiasm. The relevant units also paid attention to mutual cooperation, overcoming the past phenomenon of mutual uncoordination in the promotion of advanced experience. In addition, technical personnel and workers were consciously organized to cooperate, so that many advanced experiences have been further developed.

    At present, there are still some problems in the work of promoting advanced experience. For example, some production leaders have not yet regarded the promotion of advanced experience as their important responsibility; some cadres do not understand advanced experience, blindly shout for promotion, and lack specific organizational work; and some units have weak technical appraisal work, and some advanced experiences are promoted without appraisal. The business bureaus of the Ministry of Railways are studying solutions to these problems and are preparing to formulate a specific plan for promoting advanced experience in the second half of the year in August.

    把先进经验变为全体员工的财富
    铁路系统推广107种主要先进经验
    本报讯　自从全国铁路先进生产者代表会议开过以后，铁道部为了巩固这次会议所取得的成就，发挥“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的精神，组织了各种先进经验示范组，分赴各地传播先进经验，仅就所属六个局统计，就有九名局长和处长、二十九名工程师、七十五名先进生产者深入到各条线路上，共推广了107种主要的先进经验，听到讲解或参观了示范表演的铁路职工达两万多名。
    这些先进经验推广后，对全面完成运输计划和加速工程进度起了很大作用。机务部门推行了记名式机车周转图，加强了铁路上各个环节的计划性，七月上旬实现的机车台数占计划总台数的41.8％，七月中旬就达到46.1％。由于推广了李绍强、孙士贵的节煤经验，今年上半年共节约机车用煤达32，152吨。商务部门推广了轻重货物配装、机械拆解装载和不用立柱装车法后，不仅大大提高了车辆的净载重，而且还为国家节省了大量木材。在新线部门推广节约水泥的经验，仅第三工程局全年就能节约水泥四千吨。其他工务、车辆、电务等部门的先进经验也很多。
    铁道部这次推广先进经验所以卓有成效，主要是领导带头深入下层，并且具体组织推广，把大家的积极性带动了起来。各有关单位也注意了相互间的配合，克服了过去在推广先进经验中的互不协调现象。此外，又有意识地组织技术人员和工人合作，使许多先进经验又有了新的发展。
    目前在推广先进经验工作中还存在一些问题，例如有的生产领导者还没有把推广先进经验当作自己重要的职责；有的干部不懂先进经验，盲目空喊推广，缺少具体组织工作；还有的单位技术鉴定工作薄弱，有的先进经验没有经过鉴定即行推广。铁道部各业务局正在针对这些问题研究解决办法，并且准备在八月份制定出下半年推广先进经验的具体计划。
