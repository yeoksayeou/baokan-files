    苏日谈判在莫斯科恢复
    重光表示希望谈判能在几星期内结束
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科三十一日讯：关于苏日关系正常化的谈判，今天早晨在莫斯科的苏联外交部大厦恢复了。这次谈判的恢复是今年五月十四日的苏日公报规定的。
    苏联方面参加谈判的有：代表团团长、全权代表、苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫，苏联外交部副部长费德林，苏联驻伦敦大使马立克，对外贸易部副部长库米金，苏联外交部远东司司长顾德夫以及顾问和专家们。
    日本方面参加谈判的有：代表团团长、全权代表、日本外务相重光葵先生，曾在伦敦谈判中担任日本全权代表的松本俊一先生，日本外务省条约局局长下田武三，日本外务省欧洲问题顾问法眼晋作，日本驻瑞典公使馆顾问新关钦哉以及顾问和专家们。
    苏联和外国的新闻记者参加了苏日两国代表团第一次会议的开幕仪式。
    新华社31日讯　莫斯科消息：日本外务相重光葵七月三十日同苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫会谈以后向记者说，“我希望（日苏关系正常化）谈判能在几个星期内结束。我们想尽可能地促进谈判的进行。”
    重光表示要继续按照签订日苏和约的方针进行谈判。重光说，大部分讨论已经在伦敦谈判中充分完成了。他认为在莫斯科谈判中最困难的问题是领土问题。
    有记者问他是否可能在不缔结和约和不解决领土问题的情况下建立两国的外交关系。他说：“只有将来的事实能够说明。我们的主要任务是使关系正常化。”
    重光葵已经同谢皮洛夫商定，日苏谈判在七月三十一日正式恢复以后，每星期举行三次会议，即每星期的一、三、五。另外还可能有额外的会议。
