    Stars in the sky, one close to another,
    Why has an entire constellation flown here?
    Oh, it is our night-flying squadron,
    Patrolling with lights on.
    The night is cool as water, people are already asleep,
    Why is there a warm caress in their dreams?
    Oh, it is the wing inlaid with red stars,
    Flashing in their hearts.
    The Sword
    The night is deep, Beijing has drawn its curtains,
    Mist wraps the sleeping city, like a clean white sheet,
    The god of dreams, holding a poppy in his hand,
    Is hovering over the roofs of thousands of homes...
    However, the searchlight is awake,
    Its sharp gaze, like a waving sword,
    Cuts the night sky into countless small pieces,
    Under each piece is covered your and my tomorrow.

    繁星在天（外一首）
    公刘
    繁星在天，一颗挨紧一颗，
    为什么飞来了整个星座？
    哦，是我们夜航的机群，
    点着灯巡逻。
    夜凉如水，人们已经睡着，
    为什么梦里有温情抚摩？
    哦，是嵌着红星的机翼，
    在心上闪过。
    宝剑
    夜深了，北京拉上了它的窗帘，
    雾气裹着熟睡的城市，像一条洁白的被单，
    那手中拿着一朵罂粟花的梦之神，
    正在千家万户的屋脊上盘桓
    ……
    然而探照灯醒着，
    它的锐利的目光，如同挥动着的宝剑，
    把夜的天空割成了无数小块，
    每一块下面都复盖着你我的明天。
