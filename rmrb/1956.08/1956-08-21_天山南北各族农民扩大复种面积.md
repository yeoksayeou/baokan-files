Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 18th: Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Tianshan North and South regions of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are busily replanting in the summer fields just harvested for wheat, striving to achieve another bumper harvest of crops such as corn after the wheat harvest.

This year, in order to expand the area of food crops and solve the problem of insufficient livestock feed in previous years, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Tianshan North and South have generally expanded the area of multiple cropping. The Kashgar region has replanted more than 660,000 mu of early-maturing crops such as corn, millet, and mung beans this year, an increase of two-thirds compared to last year. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Akesu region and the Korla region, who did not have the habit of multiple cropping in the past, have also replanted a large number of early-maturing crops this year. The agricultural cooperatives in the Akesu region alone have replanted 400,000 mu. The Korla oasis has also replanted a kind of early-maturing corn, which takes only 40 days from sowing to maturity and can produce about 200 jin per mu.

    天山南北各族农民扩大复种面积
    新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北各族农民，正在紧张地在刚收割了小麦的夏田里复播，争取在小麦丰收之后，再获得玉米等作物的丰收。
    今年天山南北各地的农业社，为了扩大粮食作物面积，解决往年牲畜饲草不足的困难，普遍扩大了复播面积。喀什专区今年复播了六十六万多亩玉米、糜子、绿豆等早熟作物，比去年增加三分之二。过去没有复播习惯的阿克苏专区和库尔勒专区的各族农民，今年也复播了大量早熟作物。仅阿克苏专区各农业社就复播了四十万亩。库尔勒绿洲还复种了一种早熟玉米，这种玉米从播种到成熟只要四十多天，每亩可以产二百斤左右。
