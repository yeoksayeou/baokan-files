Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 2nd: The local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing have successively held symposiums to discuss the Chinese Communist Party's policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the democratic parties.

Everyone believes that the proposal of this policy has clarified the direction of their efforts and increased their confidence in their work. At the meetings held by the Chongqing local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and the China Democratic League, many people criticized their past temporary perspectives and also examined their shortcomings in their work. Jin Xiru, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and committee members Ye Lin and Wang Daorong, etc., all examined their past reliance on the Communist Party, and their insufficient independent thinking and judgment on issues, and expressed that they would be bolder and more proactive in their work in the future.

Many people also raised many opinions on the work of the United Front Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, believing that the United Front departments' leadership and assistance to the democratic parties was insufficient.

During the discussion, many people felt that their responsibilities for future work were even greater, and expressed that they would work hard to strengthen the work of the democratic parties and engage in more activities beneficial to the people.

    各民主党派重庆市组织
    座谈长期共存互相监督方针
    据新华社重庆2日电　各民主党派在重庆市的地方组织连续召开座谈会，讨论中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。
    大家认为这个方针的提出，使自己明确了努力的方向，增加了工作信心。在民革和民盟重庆地方组织召开的会议上，许多人批判了过去所抱的临时观点，还检查了自己在工作中的缺点。中国民主同盟重庆市委员会副主任委员金锡如、委员叶麐、王道容等都检查了过去对共产党存在着依赖思想，遇事独立思考和判断不够，表示今后在工作中要大胆、主动。
    许多人还对中共重庆市委员会统战部的工作提了不少意见，认为统战部门对民主党派的领导与帮助不够。
    在讨论中，许多人感到自己今后工作的责任更大了，表示要努力加强民主党派的工作，多从事有益于人民的活动。
