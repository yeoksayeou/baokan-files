Xinhua News Agency, August 9th. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League recently held a study session in Beijing for secretaries of the Communist Youth League Committees of national universities and secondary vocational schools to discuss how the Youth League should implement the all-round development education policy in its future work in schools, as well as issues such as cultivating good will and character and collectivist spirit among students.

There were five hundred participants in this study session. In the discussion, everyone believed that the Youth League had achieved certain successes in implementing the all-round development education policy in the past, but due to an incomplete understanding of this policy, there was a tendency to neglect students' special talents and require students to develop equally in all aspects. In the future, the Youth League should follow the spirit of "all-round development, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and combining this with developing special talents" put forward by the Ministry of Higher Education, and pay attention to developing students' special talents and interests in all activities.

When discussing the current reward system in schools, everyone believed that the method of selecting advanced collectives or excellent classes easily led to a tendency to require students to develop equally and to force uniformity, and it is not appropriate to continue to promote it in the future.

Regarding the cultivation of students' good will and character, the discussion believed that the Youth League had not paid enough attention to this aspect in the past, and it was not comprehensive. For example, in carrying out collectivist education, only the aspect of obeying the needs of the country and organization, and discipline was emphasized, while not enough attention was paid to developing students' ideals, aspirations, and cultivating students' independent thinking and creative spirit. In the future, the Youth League's ideological education for young students should, on the basis of continuing collectivist education and labor education, pay attention to cultivating students' good will and character, giving play to their special talents and abilities, and making students into people with strong will, brave and optimistic, full of ideals and creative spirit, and good at independent thinking and independent work.

Many people at the study session pointed out that the shortcomings of simplicity, impetuosity, forced uniformity, and formalism that currently exist in the Youth League's political and ideological work in schools must be overcome. In extracurricular activities, the principle of voluntary participation should be firmly implemented; in dealing with students' shortcomings and mistakes, the principle of enthusiastic assistance and active guidance must be adhered to, and the phenomenon of randomly labeling people and simply criticizing them should be overcome. The Youth League should, through its own ideological and organizational work, help students to do well in their studies, and at the same time pay attention to understanding and reflecting students' opinions on teaching and learning difficulties and problems, and assist the school administration and teachers to better improve teaching work.

    团中央举办高等学校团委书记学习会
    讨论青年团在学校工作的方针
    新华社9日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会最近在北京举办全国高等学校和中等专业学校青年团委员会书记学习会，讨论青年团今后在学校工作中应如何贯彻全面发展的教育方针以及关于培养学生良好的意志性格和集体主义精神等问题。
    参加这次学习会的有五百人。大家在讨论中认为，青年团过去在执行全面发展的教育方针方面是取得一定成绩的，但是由于对这个方针理解不全面，因此产生了忽视学生特长、要求学生平均发展的偏向。今后青年团应根据高等教育部提出的“全面发展、因才施教和发挥专长相结合”的精神，在一切活动中注意发挥学生的特长和爱好。
    在讨论到目前学校中的奖励制度时，大家认为，评选先进集体或优秀班的办法容易造成要求学生平均发展和强求一律的偏向，今后不宜继续推行。
    关于培养学生良好的意志性格问题，讨论认为青年团过去在这方面注意得不够，不全面。例如，在进行集体主义教育中只强调了服从国家需要和组织性、纪律性的一面，而对于发展学生的理想、志愿，培养学生的独立思考和创造精神这一面注意不够。今后青年团对青年学生的思想教育，应当在继续进行集体主义教育和劳动教育的基础上，注意培养学生良好的意志性格，发挥他们的特长和才能，使学生成为意志坚强、勇敢乐观、富有理想和创造精神并善于独立思考和独立工作的人。
    学习会上许多人指出，目前青年团在学校政治思想工作中存在的简单、急躁、强求一律和形式主义的缺点，必须加以克服。在课外活动中，应当坚决贯彻自愿参加的原则；在对待学生中的缺点和错误的问题上，必须坚持热情帮助、积极引导的原则，克服乱戴帽子、单纯指责的现象。青年团应该通过自己的思想工作和组织工作，帮助学生搞好学习，并且随时注意了解和反映学生对教学的意见及学习上的困难和问题，协助学校行政方面和教师更好地改进教学工作。
