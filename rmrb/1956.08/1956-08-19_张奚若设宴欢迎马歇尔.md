Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome David Marshall, Chairman of the Labour Front in Singapore, Member of the Legislative Assembly, Advisor to the Singapore Trade Delegation to China, and former Chief Minister of Singapore, who is visiting our country.

Among those present were Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

In his speech at the beginning of the banquet, Zhang Xiruo said: The Chinese and Singaporean people have had good relations since the very distant past. For centuries, there have been close cultural and economic exchanges. These long-term interactions have played a significant role in developing the economic and cultural lives of our people and have contributed greatly to the friendship and understanding between us.

Zhang Xiruo said, "One of the purposes of Mr. Marshall's visit is to enhance understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Singaporean people. We believe that through this visit, great achievements will be made in enhancing new understanding between our peoples." Zhang Xiruo expressed his admiration for Marshall's efforts in opposing colonialism, saying, "The Chinese people sympathize with and support the efforts of the Singaporean people for independence, freedom, and happiness."

In his reply, Marshall said that he was very happy to be able to visit this lovely city in a private capacity. He said: "In the past twenty-four hours, I have found goodwill and understanding everywhere, and I believe that this goodwill and understanding can completely eliminate the main difficulties in establishing a lasting foundation of racial harmony and democracy. I see no reason why we cannot have a lasting and rich friendship."

Marshall said, "Differences of opinion do exist between us. What is suitable here may not be suitable in Singapore. But differences of opinion should not be an obstacle to mutual respect and harmonious coexistence between us."

He said: "Since arriving here, my deepest feeling is the existence of goodwill and understanding beyond my expectations, and I am very happy about this. Because this is the true foundation of racial cooperation and world peace."

Finally, Marshall proposed a toast to the friendship of all races, to the prosperity of China, to racial cooperation, and to world peace.

    张奚若设宴欢迎马歇尔
    新华社18日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今晚设宴欢迎前来我国访问的新加坡劳工阵线主席、立法议会议员、新加坡贸易访华团顾问、前新加坡首席部长戴维·马歇尔。
    出席作陪的有国务院副总理陈毅、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通等人。
    张奚若在宴会开始时致词说：中国人民和新加坡人民在很远的过去就有着良好的关系。几世纪以来，在文化和经济方面有很密切的来往。这些长期的交往在发展人民之间的经济、文化生活方面曾起过很大作用，对我们之间的友谊和了解也有过很多贡献。
    张奚若说：“马歇尔先生这次访问的目的之一是增进中国人民和新加坡人民的了解和友谊。我们相信，通过这次访问，在增进我们人民之间新的了解方面一定会有很大成就。”张奚若对马歇尔在反对殖民主义方面的努力感到钦佩，他说：“中国人民同情和支持新加坡人民为独立、自由和幸福而作的努力。”
    马歇尔在答词中说，他对能以私人身份来访问这个可爱的城市感到很高兴。他说：“在过去的二十四小时内，我到处发现善意和谅解，我相信这种善意和谅解能完全消除建立起种族融洽和民主的恒久基础的主要困难的。我认为没有理由说我们不能有一个恒久的和丰富的友谊。”
    马歇尔说：“我们之间思想分歧是存在着的。在这里适合的，在新加坡不一定适合。但思想分歧不应该成为我们之间相互尊重和和洽相处的障碍。”
    他说：“来到这里以后，最深切的是感到存在着出乎我意料之外的善意和谅解，我对这点感到很高兴。因为这是种族协作和世界和平的真正基础。”
    最后，马歇尔建议为一切种族的友好、为中国的繁盛、为种族协作和世界和平而干杯。
