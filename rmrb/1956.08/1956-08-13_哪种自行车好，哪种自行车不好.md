        Which Bicycles Are Good, Which Bicycles Are Not

    The "Shengchan (Production) Brand" bicycle produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Tongchang Factory has a novel design, relatively precise construction, and a light frame, making it easy to ride, and has been well received by consumers at home and abroad. The shortcoming of this bicycle is that the handlebar plating is thin and easily rusts, the freewheel assembly quality is relatively poor, and the rivets on the saddle easily wear through clothes.

    The "Flying Pigeon Brand" bicycle produced by the Tianjin Bicycle Factory is relatively sturdy, wear-resistant, and the handlebar plating is thick, making it resistant to rust. The style is also relatively beautiful. This bicycle can carry heavier loads and is very suitable for the needs of farmers. The shortcomings are that the frame paint easily peels off, and the rivets on the saddle easily wear through clothes.

    The "Forever Brand" bicycle produced by the Shanghai Bicycle Factory has an old style, the front fork joint is not strong enough, the freewheel is not precise enough, the frame paint easily peels off, and the frame is heavy, making it difficult to ride. However, this bicycle also has advantages, namely, the freewheel assembly quality is relatively good, and the handlebar plating is relatively thick and not easily rusted. However, overall, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

    The "Xinhua (New China) Brand" bicycle produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Daxing Factory has a front fork, center shaft, etc. that are not strong enough, the handlebar plating is poor and easily rusts, and the frame paint easily peels off. Although the handlebars and other parts are processed relatively beautifully, the shortcomings are serious. (Ma Xiuchun)

    哪种自行车好，哪种自行车不好
    上海公私合营同昌工厂生产的“生产牌”自行车，式样新颖，构造比较精密，车身轻巧，骑起来不费力，受到国内外消费者的好评。这种自行车美中不足的地方是，车把电镀薄，容易生锈，飞轮装配质量比较差，铆钉在鞍座上容易磨破衣服。
    国营天津自行车厂生产的“飞鸽牌”自行车，比较坚固、耐磨力强，车把电镀厚，不容易生锈，式样也比较美观。这种自行车可以负载重一些的东西，很适合农民的需要。缺点是车架烤漆容易脱落，铆钉在鞍座上容易磨坏衣服。
    国营上海自行车厂生产的“永久牌”自行车，式样老，前杈子接口不够牢固，飞轮不够精密，车架烤漆容易脱落，车身笨重，骑起来费力。但是这种自行车也有优点，就是飞轮装配质量比较好，车把电镀较厚，不易生锈。不过，总起来说，还是缺点多。
    上海公私合营大兴工厂生产的“新华牌”自行车，前杈子、中轴等不够坚固，车把电镀差容易生锈，车架烤漆容易脱落。虽然车把等加工比较美观，但缺点是严重的。　（马秀春）
