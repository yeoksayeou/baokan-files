    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: In the past nine months ending July 1st, the total milk production of Soviet collective farms has increased by 45% compared to the same period of the previous livestock year. The average milk yield per cow has increased by 284 kilograms.
    In some regions where animal husbandry was originally backward, such as Tula Oblast and Oryol Oblast, the average milk yield per cow has even nearly doubled.
    During the same period this year, the number of fat pigs delivered to the state by Soviet collective farms has almost doubled compared to the same period last year. The number of pigs still being raised in collective farm livestock farms is one and a half times greater than last summer. Some regions have seen particularly large increases. For example, in the Ukrainian and Moldavian Republics, collective farms are now raising two to two and a half times more pigs.

    苏联集体农庄牛奶产量和肥猪数目增加很多
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　在到七月一日为止的过去九个月中，苏联集体农庄的牛奶总产量已经比上一畜牧业年度的同期多45％，每头奶牛的出奶量平均提高了二百八十四公斤。
    在图拉州、奥勒尔州这样一些畜牧业原先落后的地区，奶牛的平均出奶量甚至增加了将近一倍。
    在今年同一时期，苏联集体农庄交给国家的肥猪的数目差不多增加为去年同期的两倍。现在仍然在集体农庄饲畜场中饲养的猪则比去年夏季多一倍半。有些地区增加得特别多，例如在乌克兰和摩尔达维亚共和国，集体农庄现在正在饲养的猪增加了两倍到两倍半。
