	Reactions to Criticism

	Not Leaking, But Water Vapor
	A letter from Tianjin Municipal Public-Private Joint Southeast Rain Clothes Manufacturing Factory says: The People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Lu Xiuyu on August 3rd, criticizing that the "Red Feather Brand" raincoats produced by our factory were not waterproof. The "Red Feather Brand" rubberized fabric raincoats produced by our factory did find needle-hole seepage in 1954. After technical personnel researched and developed a "waterproofing agent," it was used from the third quarter of 1955, and the seepage problem was basically solved. As for single-rubberized fabric raincoats, the lining is a rubber surface. After gluing the seams, it is impossible for rainwater to seep through the needle-hole fiber pores like a double-rubberized fabric raincoat. If there is water inside, there may be two situations: one is water vapor. This phenomenon is especially common in summer, when clothes are thin, and the heat emitted by the human body cannot be dissipated by the rubber surface. The outside temperature is low, causing the heat to cool into water on the rubber surface. The other is rainwater entering from the hem or front placket, causing the lower part to become damp.
	According to the situation described in your newspaper, our factory inspected the single-rubberized raincoats sent to us by Comrade Lu Xiuyu multiple times and did not find any seepage or leakage. The quality of this raincoat fully meets the specifications. The leakage situation mentioned by Comrade Lu may have been caused by water vapor.
	Single-rubberized raincoats are cheap and lightweight, but their only drawback is that they are prone to water vapor. Many consumers do not understand this situation and often mistakenly think it is a leak.
	We are researching how to improve this shortcoming, but we have not yet found a proper solution.

	Leisure Time Already Arranged
	A letter from Chen Guojian, Deputy Director of Liuzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, says: The People's Daily published an article on July 25th, "Sunday is 'Occupied,'" criticizing our factory for having too many meetings, which affects the learning and health of employees. This criticism is correct. However, this mainly refers to the situation in 1955 (Comrade Lu Yuming, mentioned in the article, was transferred to the Provincial Trade Union Cadre School for study in 1955). In the past, although the Party Branch made unified arrangements for employees' leisure time every month, some meetings and activities often squeezed into Sundays due to poor planning, especially for Party members, Youth League members, activists, and comrades with many concurrent positions, who spent the whole day in meetings without rest. This year, when conducting overall planning, we have formulated specific measures to address the problem of employees' leisure time arrangements, stipulating that meetings are not allowed on Sundays, and units that must hold meetings must be approved by the Party Branch; the duties of comrades with many concurrent positions have also been reduced as appropriate. However, this has not yet been fully achieved. We plan to study further and completely solve this problem.

	Why News Becomes Old News
	A letter from the Xianyang City Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Shaanxi Province says: The People's Daily published an article on July 20th, "News Becomes Old News," criticizing our bureau for not paying attention to newspaper delivery work. The situation is basically true. However, one point needs to be explained: the village where Xinhua Third Agricultural Cooperative is located is not within our bureau's direct delivery postal route. Their newspapers are received and forwarded by the Longyansi Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The reason why the newspapers were not fully received is that our bureau's deliverer did not clearly explain this to the Longyansi Supply and Marketing Cooperative at the time of delivery, and they were mistakenly transferred to the Xinhua Seventh Agricultural Cooperative. In addition, after we sent people to investigate, we found that the Xinhua Third Agricultural Cooperative only did not receive all the newspapers in April for the second quarter. The newspapers for May and June were all received on time.
	Our bureau plans to readjust the rural delivery routes this year, and strive to deliver directly as much as possible within the scope of possibility, reduce intermediate transfers, and strive to enable more villages and agricultural cooperatives to receive letters and newspapers as soon as possible. Regarding the Shaanxi Daily that the Xinhua Third Agricultural Cooperative did not receive in April, we have agreed with them to convert the amount of money into a subscription to the Xianyang County Newspaper from August to October.

### 对批评的反应

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    不是漏雨，是有水蒸气
    天津市公私合营东南雨衣服装制造厂来信说：八月三日人民日报刊登了卢秀玉同志的来信，批评我厂生产的“红羽牌”雨衣不能防雨。我厂生产的“红羽牌”夹胶布雨衣，1954年确实曾经发现针缝渗水的现象，经技术人员研究制成了“防水剂”，从1955年第三季度开始使用以后，基本上解决了渗水的问题。至于单胶布雨衣，里子是橡胶面，粘上胶条以后，不可能像夹胶布雨衣一样从针缝纤维毛孔渗入雨水。如果里面有水，可能有两种情况：一种是水蒸气现象。这种现象特别是在夏季，衣服单薄，人体散发的热遇到橡胶面发散不出去，而外界气温较低，以致热气在胶面上冷却成水。一种是雨水从下摆或前身叠门打入，使下部潮湿。
    我厂根据你报所载情况，把卢秀玉同志寄给我们的单胶面雨衣检验了多次，并没有发现渗水、漏水现象，这件雨衣质量完全合乎规格。卢同志所说漏水情况，可能是水蒸气形成的。
    单胶面雨衣，价廉、轻便，就是容易有水蒸气，这是它的唯一缺点，很多消费者不了解这种情况，往往以为是漏水。
    我们正在研究改进这个缺点，但是目前还没有找出妥善的办法。
    业余时间已经有安排
    柳州市染织厂陈国监副厂长来信说：七月二十五日人民日报发表“星期天被‘占用’了”一文，对我厂会议过多，影响职工学习和身体健康的批评是正确的。但这主要是1955年的情况（文内提到的卢玉明同志已于1955年调省工会干部学校学习）。过去党支部虽然每月对职工业余时间都作了统一的安排，但由于计划性差，一些会议活动还经常挤到星期日去，特别是党团员积极分子及兼职多的同志，就整日开会，没有休息。今年搞全面规划时，我们对职工业余时间安排问题，已订出具体措施，规定不许在星期日开会，必须开会的单位要经党支部批准；对兼职多的同志也已酌量减少职务。但是，目前还没有完全做到这一点。我们准备进一步研究，彻底解决。
    新闻为何变旧闻
    陕西咸阳市邮电局来信说：七月二十日人民日报发表“新闻变成了旧闻”一文、对我局不重视报刊投递工作提出批评，情况基本属实。但是有一点需要说明：新华第三农业社所在村，没有划在我局直接投递邮路之内，他们的报纸是由龙岩寺供销合作社收转的。报纸没有完全收到的原因，是我局投递员起送时没有向龙岩寺供销社交代清楚，而被误转到新华第七农业社去了。另外，经我们派人前往了解，新华第三农业社第二季报纸，仅四月份没有收全，其余五、六两个月报纸都全部按时收到。
    我局准备在今年内将乡村投递邮路重新作一次调整，在可能范围内尽量做到直接投送，减少中间转递，争取使更多的村和农业社能尽快的收到信、报。新华第三农业社四月份没有收到的陕西日报，我们已商得他们的同意，按钱数折算，转订八月至十月份的咸阳县报。
