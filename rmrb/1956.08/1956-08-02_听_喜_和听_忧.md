Listening to "Good News" and Listening to "Worries"
    Chen Pu

    Recently, the "People's Daily" published a letter from a Party member, which stated that some Party organizations and Party leaders are only willing to listen to achievements in their work and are unwilling to listen to the difficulties and problems in their work. They smile when they hear so-called good reports, but frown when they hear so-called bad reports.

    Recently, the Shanghai "Xinwen Ribao" criticized a measure by the Shanghai Public Catering Company that hindered freedom of the press. The company was afraid that someone would leak the shortcomings and mistakes of the company, so they came up with an idea and formulated "Provisional Measures for Releasing News to the Public," attempting to unify public opinion.

    Listening to "good news" and not listening to "worries," and controlling public opinion may not be comparable, but the love of "good news" and fear of "worries" are common among these leaders.

    It is normal for people to like listening to good words, which is originally not blameworthy, but when it develops to the point where they are unwilling to listen to anything but good words, and not allowing anyone to say anything but good words, this is not a normal phenomenon, and the latter already constitutes a crime against the constitution.

    Many of our leaders understand the principle of "listening to both sides makes one enlightened, listening to one side makes one benighted." They can take in all kinds of opinions from below, and of course, those below are willing to provide various situations. The leaders know the situation like the back of their hands, and they can prescribe the right medicine to solve the problems.

    Some leaders, however, have their own unique way of doing things. Some people are happy when they hear "good news" and angry when they hear "worries," so those below only report "good news" and hide "worries." Some people, for the sake of their own glory, only care about "concealing evil and promoting good," regardless of the situation below, and even attempt to unify public opinion according to their own intentions. In this way, although there is a chorus of reporting "good news," "worries" will not disappear as a result.

    Those who conceal their illness and avoid medical treatment cannot be saved. Unfortunately, many people would rather not be saved than prescribe the right medicine.

    There are also some people who think too much for themselves and their units, fearing that their reputation, prestige, etc. will be damaged, so they pursue superficial achievements and regard mistakes and shortcomings as "family scandals," trying their best to prevent them from being "publicized," and even fabricate falsehoods, deceiving themselves and others. For them, no matter how much "good news" is reported, no matter how tightly "worries" are concealed, the people will still see through their tricks, and even greater "worries" await them.

### 听“喜”和听“忧”

    听“喜”和听“忧”
    陈朴
    最近“人民日报”登了一封党员来信，信里说有些党组织和党的领导人只愿听工作中的成绩，不愿听工作中的困难和问题。听到所谓好的汇报，就笑逐颜开；听到所谓坏的汇报，就眉头一皱。
    最近上海“新闻日报”批评了上海市公共饮食公司一项妨碍新闻自由的措施。这个公司惟恐有人把公司里的缺点和错误泄漏出去，于是想出了一个主意，制定了“对外发布新闻消息暂行办法”，企图统一舆论。
    听“喜”不听“忧”和统制舆论，似乎不能相提并论，但这些领导者的爱“喜”怕“忧”倒是共通的。
    爱听好话乃是人之常情，原来无可厚非，但发展到非好话不愿听，非好话不许说，这就不是正常现象，而后者已经构成违反宪法的罪行了。
    我们的很多领导者懂得“兼听则明，偏听则暗”的道理。他们对于来自下面的意见能够兼收并蓄，下面当然勇于提供各种情况。领导者对情况了如指掌，也就能够对症下药，解决问题。
    有些领导者却有自己独特的做法。有的人闻“喜”则乐，闻“忧”则怒，下面也就凡“喜”必报，凡“忧”必隐。有的人为了颜面光采，不管下面如何，只管“隐恶扬善”，甚至企图根据自己的意图来统一舆论。这样，虽然一片报“喜”声，“忧”却不会因此灭迹。
    讳疾忌医的人是不得救的。可惜不少人宁肯不得救，不肯对症下药。
    还有一些人，他们为个人和本单位想得过多，惟恐自己的名誉、威信等等受到损害，于是追求表面成绩，把错误和缺点看成“家丑”，想尽办法使它不致“外扬”，甚至虚假造作，自欺欺人。对于他们，不管“喜”报得如何多，“忧”瞒得如何紧，人民还是会看穿他们的把戏，更大的“忧”也在等着他。
