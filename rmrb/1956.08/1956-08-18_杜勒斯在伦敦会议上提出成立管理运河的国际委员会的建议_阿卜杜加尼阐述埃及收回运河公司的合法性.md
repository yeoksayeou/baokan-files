Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th - The London Conference discussing the Suez Canal issue entered substantive discussions on the afternoon of August 16th.

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles presented a plan at the meeting for the "international control" of the Suez Canal. Dulles said, "There is every reason to suggest why the Egyptian government should build and strengthen its nation materially and spiritually by all appropriate means," but he also said that if the canal were not under "international control," Egypt could obstruct navigation and "would wield a sword it could use to cut off the economic lifelines of many nations."

    Dulles' plan included the following four points: 1. The Suez Canal should be effectively managed as a free and secure international waterway in accordance with the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Therefore, an international committee to manage the canal should be established, and this committee should maintain contact with the United Nations; 2. Egypt's right to obtain fair revenue; 3. Fair compensation to the Suez Canal Company; 4. An arbitration committee appointed by the International Court of Justice to resolve disputes regarding Egypt's revenue and the company's compensation.

    Dulles said, "At this stage, any proposal should have flexibility within the limits of those basic principles we have outlined. Of course, the views of Egypt should also be made clear."

    A British Foreign Office spokesman told reporters after the meeting that Dulles' plan was not formally presented as a joint Western plan, although it was endorsed by the British and French delegations.

    The speech by Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdoelgani, the first representative of an Asian country to speak at the afternoon meeting, attracted attention for its realistic attitude and powerful arguments.

    Abdoelgani said that whatever the cause of the Suez dispute, consultations supported by strong world public opinion cannot but be victorious and bring about a peaceful solution to the current problem. The belief that war is an outdated way of resolving relations between two or more countries is increasingly becoming an indispensable element of modern life.

    Abdoelgani pointed out that most of the relationships that have formed between Asian and African countries and the old major Western powers are more or less outdated and should be seen as burdens of modern life. These relationships should be changed to conform to modern relations between countries and to the desire of all mankind to be liberated.

    Abdoelgani emphasized that I am completely unwilling to achieve our national independence or improve our living standards in a way that harms the interests of the people of the old suzerain states. However, the living standards of Western countries have improved, while the living standards of former colonies have improved extremely slowly. Compared with your perfect material facilities, our daily life can simply be described as a path to death.

    It is strange to us that some people accuse us of severing the lifelines of Western countries, as if we should not even have a little right to exist. You believe that the Suez Canal is an extremely important waterway that determines your survival, but this waterway is also vital to the economies of us and many Asian countries. However, why are we not dealing with the Egyptian government's declaration of nationalization of the Suez Canal as harshly as you are? This is not because we are less concerned about the Suez Canal issue than you are, but because we understand that the Egyptian government has the right and the obligation to seek ways and methods that benefit its own people while properly respecting international obligations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

    Abdoelgani emphasized the legitimacy of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. He said that nationalizing the Suez Canal Company is just a legitimate government nationalizing a domestic company in full compliance with compensation laws. If we recognize this, then the issues related to nationalization can of course be discussed by both parties, and if necessary, rely on the assistance of a third party. As for the suspicion of some countries as to whether Egypt will abide by the guarantee of freedom of navigation in the canal, in this case, it is not difficult to find other countries to strengthen this guarantee.

    Representatives from Sweden, Portugal, and Italy also spoke at the conference.

    According to a suggestion from the French representative, the meeting on August 17th will continue the debate. He pointed out that due to the unexpectedly rapid conclusion of the discussion on the agenda, some delegations requested time to prepare their speeches.

### 杜勒斯在伦敦会议上提出成立管理运河的国际委员会的建议  阿卜杜加尼阐述埃及收回运河公司的合法性

    杜勒斯在伦敦会议上提出成立管理运河的国际委员会的建议
    阿卜杜加尼阐述埃及收回运河公司的合法性
    新华社17日讯　伦敦消息：讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议在八月十六日下午进入实质问题的讨论。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在会上提出了一项“国际管制”苏彝士运河的计划。杜勒斯说，“有一切理由足以说明，为什么埃及政府应该通过一切适当的手段在物质上和精神上来建设和加强它的国家”，但是，他又说，假如不对运河实行“国际管制”，埃及就可能妨碍运河的通航，它“就掌握了它能够用来割断许多国家经济命脉的利剑”。
    杜勒斯提出的计划包括下列四点：一、苏彝士运河应当根据1888年君士坦丁堡公约作为一条自由的、安全的国际水道有效地加以管理。因此，应当设立管理运河的国际委员会，这个委员会应当同联合国保持联系；二、埃及取得公平的收益的权利；三、对苏彝士运河公司给予公平赔偿；四、由国际法院任命仲裁委员会，解决关于埃及的收益和公司的赔偿的争执。
    杜勒斯说，“在现阶段，任何建议都应当有在我们说明的那些基本原则的限度以内的伸缩性。当然，还应当弄清楚埃及的意见。”
    英国外交部发言人会后对记者说，杜勒斯的计划并不是作为一个西方的联合计划正式提出的，虽然它得到英国和法国代表团的赞同。
    在下午会议上发言的第一个亚洲国家的代表印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼的演说，以其态度的现实和论据的有力吸引了人们的注意。
    阿卜杜加尼说，不管苏彝士问题的争论的原因是什么，强大的世界舆论所支持的协商不能不取得胜利，而使当前的问题得到和平解决。战争是过时了的解决两国或者几国之间的关系的办法，这种信念越来越成为现代生活中不可缺少的因素。
    阿卜杜加尼指出，亚非国家同西方世界老的大国之间已经形成的关系，大多数是或多或少地过时了，这些关系应当被认为是现代生活的负担。应当改变这些关系，应当使之符合现代各国之间的关系和符合全人类要求获得解放的愿望。
    阿卜杜加尼着重说，我完全不愿意用损害旧宗主国人民利益的方法来达到我们的民族独立或者提高我们的生活水平。但是，西方国家的生活水平提高了，而前殖民地国家生活水平提高得极缓慢。同你们那种物质设备完美的生活相比，我们的日常生活简直可以说是死亡的道路。
    有人责备我们，说我们割断了西方国家的命脉，好像认为我们连一点生存权利也不应该有似的，这种责备真使我们觉得奇怪。你们认为苏彝士运河是极重要的决定你们存亡的水道，但是，这条水道也是我们和亚洲许多国家民族经济的要害。然而，为什么我们不这样强硬地对待埃及政府关于苏彝士运河国有化的声明呢？这并不是因为我们对苏彝士运河问题关心得比你们少，而是因为我们懂得埃及政府有权和有义务在恰当地尊重以平等和互利原则为基础的国际义务的情况下，寻求有利于自己人民的道路和方法。
    阿卜杜加尼强调指出埃及把苏彝士运河公司国有化的合法性。他说，把苏彝士运河公司收归国有只是一个合法的政府在完全遵守补偿法律的情况下把本国的一个公司收归国有。如果我们承认这一点，那么同实行国有化有关的问题当然可由双方来讨论，要是必要的话，可以依靠第三方面的协助。至于某些国家怀疑埃及是否会遵守运河航行自由的保证，在这种情况下，不难找出其他国家来加强这种保证。
    在这次会议上发言的还有瑞典、葡萄牙、意大利的代表。
    根据法国代表的建议，八月十七日的会议再继续进行辩论。他指出，由于对议程问题的讨论意外迅速地结束，某些代表团要求给予时间来准备它们的发言。
