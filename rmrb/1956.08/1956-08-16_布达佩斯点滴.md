	Glimpses of Budapest
	Children's Store
	In the Hungarian capital, Budapest, there is a children's store, which is the most popular place for children in Budapest. There is a talking doll in the store, wearing a Young Pioneer uniform. The children call it "Clever Michael," and young customers can ask it about anything related to the store. In fact, it is a special information desk for children.
	On the fourth floor of this store is a children's hair salon. The walls are decorated with beautiful murals, and someone tells stories to the children, so even the smallest children are quiet during haircuts. The photo department next door uses the same method to attract children.
	The most attractive part of the store is the toy department, which even adults are reluctant to leave. Children gather around the toy train that runs non-stop, or watch the three large airplanes hanging from the ceiling.
	Both the salespersons and customers in the store are children. Many salespersons are only fifteen years old, and some department directors are not yet sixteen years old.
	24-Hour Delicatessen
	Across from the National Theatre, there is the largest delicatessen in the capital. It has fifty to sixty thousand customers every day, and up to one hundred thousand on Sundays and holidays. Three hundred attendants serve customers in three shifts day and night. Because this delicatessen has spacious corridors and counters, despite having tens of thousands of customers and hundreds of staff, it never feels crowded. There is also a bar in a corner of the delicatessen.
	At three o'clock in the morning, freshly baked bread rolls are delivered, and large trucks deliver goods to this food store all day long. The electric refrigerators here can hold half a railcar's worth of meat.
	"Blue Danube" Restaurant
	The first bridge built after the war was a pontoon bridge named "Petőfi." Now that many new bridges have been built, this pontoon bridge is no longer in use. So, Budapest's one-of-a-kind restaurant, "Blue Danube," was opened on the pontoon bridge.
	Tables covered with snow-white tablecloths are set up outdoors, with Chinese-style lanterns hanging overhead. When you come to this floating restaurant at night, you will hear pleasant music, accompanied by the rhythm of the waves stirred up by passing ships lapping against the pontoon bridge. This atmosphere is truly refreshing. (Attached picture)

    布达佩斯点滴
    孩子们的商店
    在匈牙利首都布达佩斯有个儿童商店，这里是布达佩斯孩子们最乐意光顾的地方。商店里有一个会说话的大洋娃娃，穿着少先队员的衣服。孩子们称它为“聪明的米契尔”，小顾客们可以从这里询问一切有关商店的消息。实际上他就是一个为孩子特设的问讯处。
    这座商店的四楼上有儿童理发厅。墙上装饰着好看的壁画，有人给孩子讲故事，所以在理发的时候，连最小的孩子也很安静。隔壁的照像部也用同样的方法来吸引儿童。
    商店里最吸引人的还是玩具部，连大人来了也舍不得走开。孩子们成群地围着不停地奔驰的玩具火车，或是观看悬挂在天花板上的三架大飞机。
    商店的售货员和顾客都是孩子，许多售货员只有十五岁，有些部门的主任还不满十六岁。
    日夜营业的熟食店
    在国家剧院对过，有一家首都最大的熟食店。每天顾客有五、六万人，星期天和假日更达到十万人。有三百个招待员日夜分三班为顾客服务。由于这家熟食店有着宽敞的走廊和柜台，尽管有几万顾客和几百个工作人员，都从来不觉得拥挤。在熟食店的一角，还有一个酒吧。
    清晨三点钟，新烤的面包卷就送来了，大汽车整天都在为这家食品店送货。这里的电气冰箱可以装半车皮容量的肉。
    “蓝色的多瑙河”饭店
    战后修起的第一座桥是以“裴多菲”为名的浮桥。当许多新桥已经建好了的今天，这座浮桥就没有用了。于是布达佩斯的一家绝无仅有的饭店“蓝色的多瑙河”就开设在浮桥上。
    铺着雪白桌布的桌子摆在露天里，上空悬挂着中国式的灯笼。当你晚上到这家水上饭店来的时候，你会听到悦耳的音乐，配合着过往船只激起来的波浪拍打着浮桥的节奏。这种气氛的确令人心胸舒畅。（附图片）
