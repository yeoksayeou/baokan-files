    The Voice of Rural Cadres
    Leaders Should Care About Our Suffering
    Hope for a Stipulated Vacation System
    Editor:
    We work in the countryside year after year, not only without vacations, but also with very little rest time. Cadres whose homes are in the local area can still go back to check on things from time to time, but for us cadres from other places, it is rare to see our families from the beginning to the end of the year. Therefore, we ask the relevant leadership organs to stipulate a necessary vacation system for comrades working in the countryside, so that we also have the opportunity to meet with our loved ones.

    We Also Deserve a Rest
    Editor:
    I am a staff member of the Hengjiang District Grain Station in Yibin County, Sichuan. Every day from dawn to dusk, we are receiving, storing, drying, and turning the grain. Except for meal times, we hardly have any rest. Sometimes we don't even have time for lunch, and we eat it together with dinner when it gets dark. Sometimes we are still purchasing grain with the lights on. As a result, our bodies all feel overwhelmed. Therefore, I believe that reasonable rest and vacation for cadres should not only be enjoyed by workers in big cities and factories, but should also be appropriately considered for cadres working in rural areas.
    Li Ang

    When Will There Be Holidays?
    Editor:
    Many comrades in the countryside ask me why staff members and teachers in government offices and schools have holidays, while comrades working in the countryside have never enjoyed such holidays. They have no rest for more than 360 days of the year. They also said that they don't expect Sundays off, but only hope that they can have a few days, or even one day, in a year or half a year to spend as they please. But this is their ideal. Can it be realized? When will it be realized? They are eagerly awaiting it.

    Need to Study, Need Vacations
    Editor:
    We work at the People's Bank of Erling District in Danyang County, Jiangsu. We have been working for five years, running around in the countryside day and night, year after year, without getting a single vacation or opportunity to study. We don't get holidays like New Year's Day, National Day, May Day, or Sundays. Not to mention that we can't take care of our personal and family matters, but also our improvement at work is affected.
    We haven't had any systematic study since 1951. The president encourages us to start early and work late without taking a noon break, but he rarely cares about our actual suffering in life.
    We are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of being busy with work. If the leadership can arrange work time well, we will still have time to study, and the vacation problem can also be properly resolved.

    农村干部的呼声
    领导上应该关心我们的疾苦
    希望规定假期制度编辑同志：
    我们成年累月在农村工作，不但没有假期，连休息时间都很少。家在本地的干部，还可以有时回去张望张望，我们外地来的干部，年头到年尾很难得跟家人一见。因此，我们要求有关领导机关给在农村工作的同志规定必要的假期制度，让我们也有机会跟亲人见面。
    周子琴
    我们也该休息编辑同志：
    我是四川宜宾县横江区粮站的一个工作人员，我们每天从清晨到天黑，就是收、储、晒、翻粮食，除了吃饭时间，几乎没有休息，有时甚至连午饭也没时间吃，等黑了同晚饭一起吃。有时候点上灯还在收购。这样，我们的身体个个都感到吃不消了。因此，我认为干部合理的休息和休假，不能只让大城市和工厂的职工享受，也要适当地照顾到在农村工作的干部。
    李昂
    甚么时候才有假日编辑同志：
    农村里很多同志问到我，为什么机关、学校的工作人员和教师们都有假日，而工作在农村的同志，从没享受过这种假日。他们在一年的三百六十多天中没有一天休息。他们还说，不希望有星期日，只希望在一年或半年当中能有几天甚至一天的时间来由他们自己支配。但是这是他们的理想，能不能够实现？啥时候才能实现？他们在迫切地期待着。
    　竹哨
    要学习，要休假编辑同志：
    我们在江苏丹阳县珥陵区区人民银行工作，已经工作五年，成年累月日日夜夜都是在农村奔跑，而没有得到一次休假的与学习的机会，如元旦、国庆、五一、星期日的休假日，我们都没有，不用说各人的家庭私事办不了，工作上的提高也受到影响。
    我们自1951年以来就没有一次有系统的学习过，行长鼓励我们要起早带晚中午不歇，但很少关心我们实际生活上的疾苦。
    我们不是怕吃苦，不是怕工作忙。假如领导上能很好地安排工作时间，我们还是有时间学习，休假问题也可以得到适当解决的。
