    Colonialists Attempt to Prolong Their Lives
    Western Countries Intensify Efforts to Piece Together an African Military Bloc
    Xinhua News Agency, July 31st, London Dispatch: Following Egypt's announcement of the nationalization of the Suez Canal, Western colonial powers are intensifying efforts to organize an African military bloc in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    United Press International, on July 29th, quoted "well-informed sources" in London and Paris as saying that the plan to establish an "African North Atlantic Treaty Organization" has been a significant topic in preliminary, informal discussions among colonial countries such as South Africa, Britain, France, Portugal, and Belgium for some time. These sources stated that "in light of Egypt's recent actions, it is appropriate and necessary to establish some form of broader, coordinated defense alliance."
    The UPI dispatch stated that Britain had previously been "lukewarm" towards this plan, but "due to Russia's growing influence in Middle Eastern affairs and the situation created by Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal... the British government may now be more enthusiastic than before."

    殖民主义者企图苟延残喘
    西方国家加紧酝酿拼凑非洲军事集团
    新华社31日讯　伦敦消息：在埃及宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有以后，西方殖民国家正在加紧酝酿组织北大西洋公约式的非洲军事集团。
    合众社七月二十九日引用伦敦和巴黎的“消息灵通人士”的话说，一些时候以来，成立“非洲的北大西洋公约组织”的计划在南非、英国、法国、葡萄牙和比利时等殖民国家的初步非正式讨论中一直占着重要的地位。这些人士说，“鉴于埃及最近的各种行动，成立某种更加广泛的协调一致的防务联盟是适宜的，也是必要的。”
    合众社消息说，英国过去对于这个计划“一直很冷淡”，但是“由于俄国在中东事务中日益增长的影响和埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有所造成的局势……英国政府现在可能比以前热心”。
