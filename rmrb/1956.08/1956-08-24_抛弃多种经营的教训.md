Title: Lessons from Abandoning Diversified Operations

    The Longhu Township Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, achieved a bumper early rice harvest this year, with a yield of 485 jin per mu, a 50% increase over last year. However, the distribution of income within the cooperative resulted in a decrease in income for 231 out of 631 member households.

    What was the reason for this? During a recent visit to the cooperative, I found the answer.

    Longhu Township is located on the banks of the Han River, with a highway from Shantou to Chaozhou passing through the village. It is an area suitable for developing a diverse economy and sideline occupations. Among the cooperative's more than 1,600 mu of land, over 600 mu are dry land suitable for orchards and vegetable gardens. For a long time, the farmers here have been famous for growing vegetables. In the past, two or three merchant ships from Shantou, Chaozhou, and other places came here every day to buy vegetables. The women here are also skilled at making drawnwork, and they have a tradition of raising pigs and chickens. However, after full cooperativization this year, under the guidance of the local Party committee's idea of "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations," the cooperative abandoned vegetable growing and these highly profitable and quick-yielding sideline businesses.

    This year, the Second Cooperative set a production plan of 1,285 jin of rice per mu. To achieve this "thousand-jin" plan, cooperative cadres spared no effort and went all out. None of the three cooperative directors were specifically responsible for leading sideline production. To encourage members to carefully cultivate rice, the cooperative only provided rewards for exceeding the planned rice production targets. Although vegetables can be harvested five times a year, generating a total income of 200-300 yuan per mu, the cooperative directors feared that vegetable cultivation would require too much labor and fertilizer, thus affecting rice production. Therefore, they converted all the best vegetable land to grow sugarcane (which is only harvested at the end of the year) and other crops, without planting a single mu of vegetables. Furthermore, the entire cooperative had not raised a single pig, chicken, or duck in the past six months. Although fish were stocked in the more than 120 mu of fish ponds, there was no contracted production or dedicated management. The grass carp in many fish ponds lacked grass feed, and the fish were very thin, making reduced production inevitable.

    During this process, some cooperative cadres felt that something was wrong and proposed allocating some manpower to manage sideline occupations. However, the cooperative director said, "There is no mistake in not engaging in sideline occupations; it is a mistake if the rice production increase plan is not fulfilled." As a result, the cooperative's sideline production was stifled in this way.

    To ensure that members focused on cultivating rice and completing the "thousand-jin" plan, cooperative cadres also took many measures to restrict members from engaging in household sideline production. When cooperative cadres saw some women making drawnwork and earning money for themselves, they feared that it would influence other members to engage in other sideline occupations. Therefore, they proposed that 50% of the wages earned by members from drawnwork should be turned over to the cooperative (the higher authorities had also issued such instructions). This proved to be effective. Soon, many women abandoned this craft and picked up hoes to work in the fields.

    However, the cooperative had little land and a large population, with an average of only six fen of land per person. There was already a surplus of labor. As a result, the labor surplus became even more acute. At that time, one or two hundred people were idle every day, and the members were very dissatisfied and lacked enthusiasm for production; more than a dozen member households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative.

    After this distribution, the cooperative cadres began to recognize the mistake of only focusing on rice and not developing a diverse economy and sideline occupations. To make up for the losses in the first half of the year, the cooperative recently made new arrangements for agricultural and sideline production in the second half of the year. They decided that in addition to ensuring good rice production, they would transfer some labor to specialize in sideline occupations, and women would do drawnwork at home. The cooperative established sideline occupation groups for drawnwork, bamboo work, ash burning (kilns), pig raising, and fish farming, with a vice director specifically in charge.

    Now, the entire cooperative has raised 70 pigs and sheep, and has also allocated some piglets and chicks for members to raise privately. Some vegetable land has been restored for growing vegetables. Since the abolition of the regulation that 50% of drawnwork wages should be turned over to the cooperative, there are now about 400 women in the cooperative doing drawnwork every day. From August 1st to 16th, the income from drawnwork for the women in the entire cooperative has reached 1,400 yuan. The cooperative's bamboo ware and ash kiln groups have already started production and will have an income of nearly 100 yuan this month.

    After this arrangement, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for production has been greatly improved. Now, not only has sideline production been started, but the technical reform of late rice has also been completed according to plan.

    抛弃多种经营的教训
    新华社记者　王曼
    广东省潮安县龙湖乡第二农业生产合作社今年早稻获得了每亩产谷四百八十五斤的丰收，比去年增产了五成。但是，这个社分配的结果，在六百三十一户社员中，却有二百三十一户减少了收入。
    这究竟是什么原因呢？记者最近在这个社访问的时候，找到了答案。
    龙湖乡位于韩江边上，一条汕头至潮州的护堤公路穿过村边，是一个适宜发展多种经济和副业的地区。这个社的一千六百多亩土地中，旱园占了六百多亩。长期以来，这里的农民就以种植蔬菜出名。往年汕头、潮州等地每天都有两三只商船到这里来买蔬菜。这里的妇女又擅长做抽纱，养猪、养鸡都有习惯。但是，今年全乡合作化以后，在当地党委“重农业、轻副业”的思想指导下，这个社便把种菜和这些收利大而且快的副业抛弃了。
    第二社今年制定了每亩水田产谷一千二百八十五斤的增产计划，为了实现这个“千斤”计划，社干部们就不顾一切，全力以赴。三个社主任中没有专人领导副业生产。为了吸引社员精心莳弄水稻，社在制定超额奖励办法时也只规定水稻超额完成计划才有奖励。虽然，蔬菜一年能收五次，每亩共可收入二、三百元，但因为种植蔬菜费工多，用肥多，社主任们怕影响水稻生产，就把全部顶好的菜地改种了甘蔗（年底才有收成）和别的作物，连一亩蔬菜也没有种。不仅如此，全社半年来还没有养过一头猪、一只鸡和鸭。一百二十多亩鱼塘虽然放下了鱼，因为没有实行包工包产，没有专人管理，许多鱼塘的鲩鱼缺乏草料饲养，鱼儿十分瘦小，减产已成定局。
    在这个过程中，也有的社干部觉得不对头，曾提出分些人力来管副业，但社主任说：“不搞副业没有错误，完成不了水稻增产计划要犯错误。”因此，这个社的副业生产便被这样扼杀了。
    社干部们为了使社员专心莳弄水稻，完成“千斤”计划，还采取许多办法限制社员从事家庭副业生产。社干部们看到一些妇女做抽纱，赚钱归自己，怕影响别的社员也去干别项副业，便提出社员做抽纱所得的工钱要归社50％（上级也有过这种指示），这样以来，果真见效，不久许多妇女便抛下这个手艺抓起锄头下地了。
    但是，这个社地少人多，平均每人才有六分地，本来劳动就多余，这么一来，劳动力更加过剩了。当时，每天都有一两百人闲着没工做，社员们非常不满，生产积极性不高；十多户社员想退社。
    经过这次分配，社干们开始认识了只管水稻不发展多种经济和副业的错误。为了弥补上半年的损失，最近，社里对下半年的农副业生产重新作了安排。他们决定除保证做好水稻生产外，抽调一部分劳动力专门搞副业，妇女在家做抽纱。社里成立了抽纱、竹业、烧灰（窑）、养猪和养鱼等副业小组，由一个副主任专门领导。
    现在，全社已养了猪、羊七十只，还拨出一部分猪苗和鸡苗供社员私养，并已恢复了部分菜地来种菜。自从取销了抽纱工钱50％归社的规定后，现在，全社每天都有四百左右的妇女在做抽纱，从八月一日到十六日，全社妇女抽纱的收入已经达一千四百元。社的竹器和灰窑组已经开始生产，这个月也将有近百元的收入。
    经过这样安排以后，这个社社员的生产积极性大大提高了。现在，不仅搞起了副业生产，晚稻的技术改革也按计划完成了。
