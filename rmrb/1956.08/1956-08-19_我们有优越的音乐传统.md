We have a superior musical tradition
Yin Faru

Our ancestors created the art of music through labor in ancient times. Since the advent of writing, a large amount of musical historical data has been preserved. Ancient books say: "Striking stones, patting stones, all beasts danced." After hunting, people beat stone slabs, imitated the movements of various wild animals, and held collective dances. The musical instruments used were very simple. What is recounted here is the earliest collective musical activity.

The musical instruments of the Shang Dynasty that have been unearthed now include chimes, drums, bells, and xun, which are probably relics from the 12th to 14th centuries BC. The largest and most complete of these is the large stone chime discovered in Anyang, which is finely textured and engraved with exquisite tiger patterns. Some small stone chimes have also been discovered, and it seems that there were already "bianqing" at that time—arranging many chimes together, but not necessarily with differences in pitch. Many bronze bells have been unearthed, often three together, with the same patterns and inscriptions, but different sizes, which indicates that the three were a set, representing three different pitches. The oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty contain the character "龠" (yue), which looks like a primitive "panpipe" in terms of its shape. The oracle bone inscriptions contain the character "乐" (le, music). In terms of meaning, although it cannot be interpreted as "music," in terms of its shape, it looks like silk strings stretched on a wooden frame, so some people think it was originally a musical instrument. Stringed instruments gradually evolved from bows used for shooting birds and animals. Here, the use of silk for strings is of great significance, because if leather had always been used for strings, it would not have been possible to develop into various forms of exquisite, lightweight, and accurately sounding stringed instruments. China was the first country to discover and use silk, so the Chinese should also be the first to use silk strings to make musical instruments. It can be inferred that during the Shang Dynasty, especially in the last two hundred years of the Shang Dynasty, music was quite developed and there was a certain amount of knowledge of musical temperament.

During the Shang Dynasty, there probably already appeared hereditary "musicians"—professional music masters, some of whom were slaves. These musicians absorbed and summarized the experience and knowledge of the broad masses of working people in musical activities, which played a significant role in improving the level of musical art. People obtained some rules in the long-term musical practice, which led to the formation of music theory; with music theory, the manufacturing method of musical instruments was improved, promoting the development of instrumental and vocal music.

Music reflects "major national events"—sacrifices and wars. Most of the "Shang Hymns," "Zhou Hymns," and "Lu Hymns" in the Book of Songs are sacrificial songs and dances. Legend has it that Shang Tang's music and dance was called "Da Hu" ("Great Protection"), "saying that Tang inherited decline and could protect the people's urgent needs." Zhou Gong's music and dance was called "Da Wu" ("Great Military"), "saying that his virtue could achieve military exploits." These are all music and dance about war. Music reflects the people's living conditions, people's thoughts, feelings, and wishes, which is our rich and vibrant folk music.

Many times in history, work has been done to collect and organize folk music. Although each time only a part of folk music is collected, and it is not possible to collect all folk music; however, each collection and organization work has had a great impact, from which we can see the great contribution of folk music.

The first large-scale collection and organization of folk music began in the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th-8th centuries BC) and ended in the Spring and Autumn Period (8th-5th centuries BC). The collected materials were selected, sorted, and arranged, and became the "Book of Songs" that has been handed down to this day. Most of the poems in the Book of Songs are works from the Western Zhou Dynasty. Some are noble's songs (Ya and Song), and most are folk songs from various places (Guo Feng). The laborers who cut down sandalwood trees cursed the nobles who did not work but reaped the rewards, and the fleeing people compared the rulers to greedy rats. From here, we hear the clarion call of the oppressed.

In the late Warring States Period (5th-3rd centuries BC), the great poet Qu Yuan of Chu collected folk songs and processed them, and created new poems based on folk songs, all of which were full of love for the motherland and the people. The works of him and his descendants Song Yu, Jing Cha, and others are collectively called "Chu Ci." Chu Ci is the poetry of the people of Chu, and it is also the local music of Chu.

Ancient books say that during the Western Zhou Dynasty there was already knowledge of "twelve tones" and "five sounds." This record is reliable, and we can also find proof from the Book of Songs: (1) The Book of Songs mentions as many as twenty-five kinds of musical instruments. (2) The Book of Songs writes "bells and drums play music," and "flutes and pipes are all prepared," indicating that there was already a relatively complex orchestra organization at that time. (3) The songs in the Book of Songs could still be played in the Spring and Autumn Period. Confucius (551-479 BC) listened to the performance of "Guan Ju" and said excitedly: "How vast and full it is, filling the ears!" Looking at this situation, it would be incomprehensible if there was no relatively mature knowledge of music theory at that time.

Because of this, some excellent musicians appeared in the Spring and Autumn Period, such as Shi Juan, Shi Kuang, and Shi Xiang. Shi Kuang was particularly famous. Two hundred years later, Mencius also said: "Shi Kuang's hearing, without the six temperaments, cannot correct the five sounds." He regarded him as the representative figure of musicians.

In terms of music theory, using bamboo tubes or silk strings, first determine a fundamental tone, and then successively determine the other twelve scales (twelve temperaments) of different pitches according to the length ratio of two-thirds (subtract one-third) and one and one-third (add one-third). This method is called the "three-part subtraction and addition method." The earliest record of the three-part subtraction and addition method is found in "Guanzi," which preserves some historical materials from the Warring States period. However, according to the above-mentioned developed music of the Western Zhou Dynasty, it can be judged that the invention and application of this method must have been far earlier than this time, much earlier than the same invention of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c. 571-497 BC), who laid the foundation of Western music theory.

Music changes with the times. In any era, people like folk music, even the ruling class is like this. In the Warring States period, Marquis Wen of Wei asked Zixia: When I listen to ancient music, I just want to sleep; when I listen to "the music of Zheng and Wei" (referring to folk songs), I forget my tiredness. "May I ask why ancient music is like that? Why is new music like this?" Zixia elaborated on a large number of principles based on the Confucian educational philosophy, praising ancient music and criticizing new music. In fact, ancient music had become rigid and had no power to move the audience, while folk songs were full of vigorous vitality. Counting from the "ancient music" of the Warring States period, the so-called "court music" of all dynasties has a common feature, that is, it is merely formal and lacks vivid content.

Confucianism attaches importance to music, fully recognizing the power of music to express and infect, so it understands the customs of the people and carries out educational work through music. The most obvious point in their music theory is to use music to consolidate family ethics, and ethical relations expand from father and son to ruler and minister. Confucius advised young people to study the Book of Songs, saying that after studying the Book of Songs, in the near future, they can serve their father; in the distant future, they can serve the monarch. Xunzi said: "Therefore, when music is in the ancestral temple, both the ruler and the ministers listen to it together, and everyone is harmonious and respectful; within the boudoir, both the father and the son and brothers listen to it together, and everyone is harmonious and loving; among the townships and clan leaders, both the elders and the young listen to it together, and everyone is harmonious and obedient." By the Han Dynasty, the Confucianists further elaborated on it, such as saying that the role of the Book of Songs is to "manage husband and wife, achieve filial piety and respect, enrich human ethics, beautify education, and change customs." Distorted explanations were made of the folk songs in the Book of Songs. The Confucian theory of music reflects the attempt to arrange and consolidate a new social order.

The second large-scale collection of folk music was during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (reigned 140-87 BC). At that time, both the economy and culture had developed, and the court also paid attention to music. Emperor Wu established a music management agency called "Yuefu," so the music collected this time was called "Yuefu," also known as "Qing Shang Music." Qing Shang Music prevailed in the Han, Wei, Jin, and Southern Dynasties eras. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Zhang Qian traveled to the Western Regions and brought the music of the Western Regions to Chang'an, which also had an impact on the music scene at that time.

The Northern and Southern Dynasties era (4th-6th centuries) was a turbulent era, and Chinese music was brewing huge changes. The long-term peaceful life state of the Central Plains people determined their music and dance melody—slow, leisurely, symbolizing a strong pastoral flavor. The bland style of Qing Shang Music could not meet the requirements of the rapidly developing cities since the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Therefore, not only did folk music and dance from various regions of the country have the opportunity to be excavated and organized, but also the music and dance of the Western Regions (including Xinjiang, Central Asia, and India) spread to the Central Plains along with Buddhism. The lightweight and loud musical instruments of the Western Regions were also introduced into the Central Plains and gradually matched with the Central Plains instruments.

The third large-scale collection and organization of folk music and foreign music began in the Sui Dynasty (late 6th century); during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty (early 8th century), the movement to collect music reached its peak. The Sui Dynasty ruled for a short period of time and did not have the strength to carry out this work. In the early Tang Dynasty, for more than a hundred years, society was stable and the economic situation improved. The Tang Dynasty people not only inherited and carried forward the cultural traditions of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, but also continuously absorbed the cultures of other ethnic groups to enrich their own social content. This created favorable conditions for the development of music. In the early Tang Dynasty, the "Nine Divisions of Music" of the Sui Dynasty were continued, and in 640 AD, it was increased to "Ten Divisions of Music": (1) Yan Music Performers, (2) Qing Shang Performers, (3) Xiliang Performers (Wuwei, Gansu), (4) Tianzhu Performers (India), (5) Goryeo Performers (Korea), (6) Kucha Performers (Kuqa, Xinjiang), (7) Anguo Performers (Bukhara, Central Asia), (8) Shule Performers (Shule, Xinjiang), (9) Kangguo Performers (Samarkand, Central Asia), (10) Gaochang Performers (Turpan, Xinjiang). When the court held banquets, these ten divisions of music were often merged into "Seated Divisions" and "Standing Divisions." The seated divisions played while sitting in the hall, and the standing divisions played while standing in the hall.

In 714 AD, Xuanzong set up five "Jiaofang" (training centers for court musicians): the Inner Jiaofang was in the palace; the Outer Jiaofang, two in Chang'an and two in Luoyang. There were also "Liyuan" (Pear Garden) and "Yichun Yuan" in the palace. These were all places for collecting music and accommodating and training various musicians, and also places for spreading music. Each state, county, and aristocratic family also had music and dance performers. The total number of "sound people" reached tens of thousands.

Through the efforts of vast numbers of musicians and dancers—both professional and non-professional—the long-term contact and convergence of Central Plains music and foreign music bloomed into beautiful flowers in the fertile garden of Central Plains culture, which is the historically famous "Tang Music." Tang Music took Central Plains music as its foundation, but absorbed the excellent and fresh musical elements from various regions, and was a highly artistic creation with international significance and at the same time a new national form of China. Tang Music was not only loved by the Chinese people at that time, but also spread to neighboring countries such as India, Japan, and Korea, and was loved by foreign people.

The sources of Tang Dynasty music are also diverse. The long ones are called "Daqu" (grand compositions), and the generally shorter ones are called "Zaquzi" (miscellaneous pieces). At first, musicians chose five-character or seven-character poems to match with the music and sing, and the lyrics written by poets for the music were also five- or seven-character poems; later, they gradually tried to fill in long and short sentences according to the rhythm of the music, which was the beginning of Tang and Song Ci poetry. All the music that had been filled with lyrics was called "Cidiao" (lyric tune). Tang and Song Daqu were all dance music, each song was divided into twelve major sections, and the structure was very complex. Using Daqu to sing stories, this gradually evolved into the "Zaju" (variety plays) of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Zaju then led to the emergence of Chinese opera.

According to rough statistics, there are more than 3,000 traceable names of music from the Tang and Song Dynasties. It is unknown how many are not recorded. Historical materials discovered in Dunhuang contain Tang Dynasty musical scores and dance scores, and Japan also has Tang Dynasty musical scores, but unfortunately, these musical notes and symbols cannot be correctly identified at present.

The fourth large-scale collection of folk music was in the Southern Song Dynasty (12th-13th centuries). What was collected this time was Zaju, which also included folk music. Song Dynasty music was inherited from the Tang Dynasty and developed, but the scale of the Jiaofang was far less than that of the Tang Dynasty. Commerce and urban economy in the Song Dynasty also developed further, and the population increased in cities. To meet the needs of people's cultural life, the number of folk artist groups greatly increased. Music and dance were still prevalent, and filling in lyrics and singing lyrics became the fashion of the times. In Bianjing (Kaifeng) in the Northern Song Dynasty and Lin'an (Hangzhou) in the Southern Song Dynasty, there were fixed areas where folk artists engaged in artistic activities. Zaju had already appeared in the Northern Song Dynasty, and gradually became popular in the Southern Song Dynasty. Today, the names of 280 volumes of "Official Edition Zaju Segments" are still preserved. Since it is called "Official Edition," it must have been organized by the government.

Some of the musical scores in the "White Stone Taoist Songs" by the Southern Song Dynasty lyricist Jiang Kui have been preserved. After research and arrangement by Mr. Yang Yinliu and others, not only can some of the Southern Song Dynasty music be played, but also some of the Southern Song Dynasty lyrics can be sung.

The fifth large-scale collection of folk music was in the Yuan Dynasty (late 13th century-mid 14th century). What was collected this time was the "Yuanben" of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties—the Zaju popular in the north, which also included folk music. Today, a "Yuanben Name List" is still preserved, totaling 690 kinds. The "Daleshu" (Great Music Bureau), the national music management agency of the Yuan Dynasty, was very weak, while the number of folk artists increased day by day. The collection of these Yuanben may have been carried out by folk artist groups. The territory of the Yuan Dynasty spanned Asia and Europe, and many foreigners moved to China, so new foreign elements were added to Chinese music. At that time, in addition to creating operas, many new folk songs also emerged. Historically, the folk songs popular in the Yuan Dynasty were called "Sanqu" (lyrical songs).

From the musical history after the Southern Song Dynasty, we can see: (1) The ability of the court to manage music and dance was weakening day by day, while the musical and theatrical activities of folk artists were strengthening day by day. Their activities were supported by the broad masses of people and possessed profound strength. (2) Opera became popular, and many music and dances were absorbed into opera. Music and opera are inseparable. Therefore, in cities, the opportunity for a piece of music to be played alone or a dance to be performed alone was relatively reduced. This situation became more significant in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

Many local operas developed in the Ming Dynasty. After the reign of Emperor Jiajing of the Ming Dynasty (mid-16th century), due to the formation of urban handicraft workshops, the development of commercial economy, the prosperity of cities, and the influence of early Western capitalism, the seeds of capitalism had already been bred within Chinese feudal society. This further promoted the development of opera. Not only were there many types of operas, but also the scale of opera—especially Southern Opera—reached a complete stage. The content of the operas also reflected the ideal of resisting traditional feudal consciousness and pursuing individual liberation. For example, Xu Wei's "Female Champion" praised women's talents, and Tang Xianzu's "Peony Pavilion" praised sincere love, which had the same theme ideas as the novels of the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties.

The most popular operas in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties were "Yiyang Tune" and "Kunshan Tune" (Kunqu). Kunshan Tune can be said to be the culmination of Southern Opera. In the mid-18th century, Kunshan Tune gradually declined, and "Pihuang Opera" ("Xipi", "Erhuang") rose instead, which was the predecessor of Peking Opera. Many musical scores from the Ming and Qing Dynasties have been preserved, and many pieces of music still circulate among the people.

A rich musical heritage is waiting for us to collect and sort out. According to Mr. Cha Yiping, in recent years, the National Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music alone has collected 30,000 folk songs and ballads; preliminary research has shown that there are many pieces of music from before the Ming and Qing Dynasties. This work needs to be continued. It is hoped that music workers will select the applicable parts of the historical heritage, sort them out, promote them, and create new works with national style to reflect our great era and bring greater encouragement and joy to the happy people of the motherland.

    我们有优越的音乐传统
    阴法鲁
    我们的祖先在远古时代，由于劳动创造了音乐艺术。自从有了文字以后，就有大量的音乐史料保存下来。古书上说：“击石拊石，百兽率舞。”人们在狩猎之后，敲打着石片，模仿各种野兽的动作，举行集体舞蹈。用的乐器非常简单。这里所追叙的是最早的集体的音乐活动。
    现在出土的商代的乐器有磬、鼓、铎、埙等，大概都是纪元前十二世纪到十四世纪的遗物。其中最大最完整的一件是在安阳发现的大石磬，质地细腻，上面刻着精美的虎形。小石磬也发现过一些，似乎当时已有“编磬”——把许多磬排列在一起，但不一定有音高上的区别。出土的铜铎比较多，往往是三个在一起，花纹和铭文都相同，而大小不同，这说明三个是一套，代表了三种不同的音高。商代的甲骨文中有“龠”字，就字形看，很像原始的“排箫”。甲骨文中有“乐”字。就文义看，虽然它不能作“音乐”解释；但就字形看，它像木架上张着丝弦，所以有人认为它原来就是一种乐器。弦乐器是由射鸟兽的弓逐渐改进发展而成的。这里，使用丝来做弦有着重大意义，因为如果一直用皮革来做弦，那是不能变成各种形式的精致轻便而发音准确的弦乐器的。中国是最早发现并使用丝的国家，因此，最早使用丝弦做乐器的也应当是中国人。可以推断，在商代，特别是商代后期二百年间，音乐已经相当发达了，也有了一定的乐律知识。
    在商代大概已经出现了世袭的“乐人”——职业音乐师，其中有一部分是奴隶身份。这种乐人吸收和总结广大劳动人民在音乐活动方面的经验和知识，对于音乐艺术水平的提高是起了很大的作用的。人们在长期的音乐实践过程中得到一些规律，因而导致音乐理论的形成；有了音乐理论，又转而改进了乐器的制作方法，推动了器乐和声乐的发展。
    音乐反映了“国之大事”——祭祀和战争。“诗经”里的“商颂”、“周颂”、“鲁颂”等大部分是祭祀的乐舞。相传商汤的乐舞叫“大护”，“言汤承衰，能护民之急也。”周公的乐舞叫“大武”，“言其德能成武功”。这都是关于战争的乐舞。音乐反映了人民的生活状况，人民的思想、感情和愿望，这就是我们的内容丰富的、具有充沛的生命力的民间音乐。
    在历史上进行过许多次搜集、整理民间音乐的工作。虽然每一次所搜集的都只是民间音乐的一部分，而不可能是全部的民间音乐；但每一次的搜集、整理工作都发生过很大的影响，从此也可以看到民间音乐的伟大贡献。
    第一次大规模地搜集、整理民间音乐开始于西周时期（公元前11—8世纪），到春秋时期（前8—5世纪）告一段落。把搜集的材料加以选择、整理、编排，就成了流传到今天的“诗经”。诗经中的诗多半是西周时期的作品。一部分是贵族的乐歌（雅、颂），大部分是各地的民歌（国风）。砍伐檀树的劳动者在诅咒不劳而获的贵族，逃亡的人们把统治者比作贪得无厌的大老鼠，从这里我们听到了被压迫者的反抗的号角。
    到战国（前5—3世纪）后期，楚国的大诗人屈原搜集民歌进行加工，并以民歌为基础创造新的诗篇，都充满了热爱祖国和人民的情绪。他和他的后辈宋玉、景差等人的作品，统称为“楚辞”。楚辞是楚国人的诗辞，也是楚国的地方音乐。
    古书上说，西周时期已经有“十二律”、“五声”的知识，这种记载是可靠的，我们从诗经中也能得到证明：（1）诗经里说到的乐器有二十五种之多。（2）诗经里写着“钟鼓乐之”、“箫管备举”，可见当时已有比较复杂的乐队的组织。（3）诗经里的歌曲，在春秋时期都还可以演奏。孔子（前551—479）听了演奏“关睢”之后，兴奋地说：“洋洋乎，盈耳哉！”看这种情况，如果当时没有比较成熟的乐律学的知识，那是不可理解的。
    正因为这样，所以春秋时期出现了一些优秀的音乐家，如师涓、师旷、师襄等。师旷尤为著名。二百年之后，孟子还说：“师旷之聪，不以六律不能正五音。”把他看成乐师的代表人物。
    在乐律学上，用竹管或丝弦，先定出一个基音，然后依次按三分之二（三分损一）和一又三分之一（三分益一）的长度比例，定出其他高低不同的十二个音阶（十二律），这种方法叫“三分损益法”。关于三分损益法的记载，最早见于“管子”，这部书保存了战国时代的一些史料。但根据上述西周时期音乐发达的情况，可以判断这种方法的发明和应用，必远在此时以前，比奠定西洋乐理基础的希腊哲学家毕达哥拉斯（约纪元前571—497年）的同样发明，要早得多。
    音乐是随着时代变化的。任何时代，人们都喜欢民间音乐，连统治阶级也是如此。在战国时代，魏文侯就问子夏：我听古乐，只想睡觉；听“郑卫之音”（指民歌），就忘了疲倦。“敢问古乐之如彼何也？新乐之如此何也？”子夏本着儒家的教育哲学发挥了一大篇道理，赞美古乐，抨击新乐。实际上是古乐已经僵化了，没有感动听众的力量，而民歌则富有蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。从战国时代的“古乐”算起，历代的所谓“雅乐”都有共同的特点，就是徒具形式，缺乏生动活泼的内容。
    儒家重视音乐，充分地认识到音乐的表现和感染的力量，因此通过音乐了解民情风俗，并进行教育工作。他们的音乐理论中最显明的一点：用音乐来巩固家族伦理关系，伦理关系从父子扩大到君臣。孔子劝青年学习诗经，他说学习诗经之后，就近处说，可以事奉父亲；就远处说，可以事奉国君。荀子说：“故乐在宗庙之中，则君臣上下同听之，莫不和敬；闺门之内，则父子兄弟同听之，莫不和亲；乡里族长之中，则长少同听之，莫不和顺。”到了汉代，儒家又作了进一步的阐发，如说诗经的作用在“经夫妇，成孝敬，厚人伦，美教化，移风俗。”对诗经中的民歌作了歪曲的解释。儒家的音乐理论反映了安排并巩固新的社会秩序的企图。
    第二次大规模地搜集民间音乐是在汉武帝（前140—87年在位）时。那时经济和文化都有了发展，朝廷又注意到音乐。武帝设立了一个音乐管理机构叫“乐府”，因而这次搜集的音乐便称为“乐府”，也称为“清商乐”。清商乐盛行于汉、魏、晋和南北朝时代的南朝。汉武帝时，张骞通西域，曾经把西域的乐曲传到长安，对当时的音乐界也发生过影响。
    南北朝时代（4—6世纪）是一个动荡的时代，中国音乐正酝酿着巨大的变化。中原民族的长期的宁静的生活状态规定了他们的乐舞旋律——舒缓、悠闲，象征着浓厚的田园意味。清商乐的这种平淡风格，不能满足南北朝以来迅速发展的城市的要求了。因此，不但国内各地区的民间乐舞又有被发掘整理的机会，而且西域（包括新疆、中亚细亚、印度）乐舞也伴随着佛教在中原传播起来。西域的轻便而发音响亮的乐器也传进中原，逐渐地和中原乐器配合起来。
    第三次大规模地搜集、整理民间音乐和外来音乐，开始于隋代
  （6世纪末）；唐玄宗时（8世纪前期），搜集音乐的运动达到了最高峰。隋朝统治的时期很短，没有力量进行这项工作。唐代初期一百多年间，社会安定，经济情况好转。唐代人民不但继承并发扬南北朝的文化传统，而且不断地吸取其他各民族的文化，以丰富自己的社会内容。这给音乐的发展创造了有利条件。唐初，沿用隋代的“九部乐”，到公元640年增为“十部乐”：（1）燕乐伎，（2）清商伎，（3）西凉伎，（甘肃武威），（4）天竺伎（印度），（5）高丽伎（朝鲜），（6）龟兹伎（新疆库车），（7）安国伎（中亚的布哈拉），（8）疏勒伎（新疆疏勒），（9）康国伎（中亚的撒马尔罕），（10）高昌伎（新疆吐鲁番）。这十部伎，朝廷举行宴会时，常归并为“坐部伎”和“立部伎”。坐部在堂上坐着演奏，立部在堂下站着演奏。
    公元714年，玄宗设置“教坊”五所：内教坊在宫廷里；外教坊，长安两所，洛阳两所。宫廷里还有“梨园”和“宜春院”。这都是搜集音乐并安置、训练各种乐工的地方，也是传播音乐的地方。各州郡和贵族豪门也都有伎乐。“声音人”的总数到达几万人。
    中原音乐和外来音乐长期地接触汇合，由于广大的——职业的和非职业的——乐工和舞工的努力，在肥沃的中原文化的园地里开出了美丽的花朵，这就是历史上著名的 “唐乐”。唐乐以中原音乐为根本，但吸收了各地区的优秀的新鲜的音乐成分，有国际意义的内容而同时又是中国新的民族形式的高度艺术创造。唐乐不仅为当时的中国人民所喜爱，而且也传到各邻邦如印度、日本、朝鲜，为外国人民所喜爱。
    唐代乐曲的来源也是多方面的，长的叫“大曲”，一般比较短的叫“杂曲子”。最初乐人选择五言或七言诗配在乐曲里唱，诗人为乐曲作的歌词也都是五七言诗；后来逐渐地试验着依照乐曲的节拍而填制长短句的歌词，这就是唐宋词的开端。凡是填过词的乐曲，就称为“词调”。唐宋大曲都是舞曲，每曲分为十二大段，结构很复杂。用大曲演唱故事，这样就逐渐演变成宋代和元代的“杂剧”。杂剧又导引了中国戏剧的产生。
    唐宋两代的乐曲，据约略统计，其名目可考的有三千多个。不见于记载的，不知道有多少。敦煌发现的史料中有唐代的乐谱和舞谱，日本也有唐代的乐谱，可惜目前还不能正确地辨认这些谱字和符号。
    第四次大规模地搜集民间音乐是在南宋时期（12—13世纪）。这次搜集的是杂剧，其中也包含了民间音乐。宋代的音乐都是承继唐代的而又加以发展，但教坊的规模则远不及唐代。宋代的商业和城市经济又有了进一步的发展，城市里人口增多。由于适应人们的文化生活的需要，民间艺人团体大大地增多了。乐舞仍然盛行，填词唱词成了时代的风尚。在北宋的汴京（开封），南宋的临安（杭州），都有民间艺人从事艺术活动的固定的地区。北宋已经出现了杂剧，到南宋逐渐盛行起来。今天还保存了“官本杂剧段数”280本的名目。既称“官本”，想必是经过官方的整理。
    南宋词人姜夔的“白石道人歌曲”中保留下来一部分乐谱，经杨荫浏先生等研究整理，不但南宋的一部分乐曲可以演奏出来，南宋的一部分歌词也可以唱出来。
    第五次大规模地搜集民间音乐是在元代（13世纪末叶—14世纪中叶）。这次搜集的是金元时代的“院本”——流行于北方的杂剧，其中也包含了民间音乐。今天还保存了一份“院本名目”，计690种。元代国家的音乐管理机构“大乐署”，力量很弱，而民间艺人则日益增多。这些院本的搜集工作可能是民间艺人团体进行的。元代的版图横跨亚洲和欧洲，外国人迁入中国的很多，因此，中国音乐中又增加了新的外来的成分。当时除了创 作戏剧之外，还涌现了许多新的民歌。历史上把元代流行的民歌称为“散曲”。
    从南宋以后的音乐史上，我们可以看到：（1）朝廷管理乐舞的能力日见削弱，而民间艺人的音乐和戏剧活动日见加强。他们的活动得到广大人民的支持，拥有深厚的力量。（2）戏剧盛行起来，许多乐曲和舞蹈被吸收在戏剧里。音乐和戏剧分不开。因此，在城市里，一个乐曲单独演奏或一种舞蹈单独表演的机会，就相对地减少了。这种情况到了明清时代更为显著。
    明代许多地方戏都发展起来。明世宗嘉靖（16世纪中叶）以后，由于城市手工工场的形成，商业经济的发展，城市的繁荣，以及西洋初期资本主义的影响，中国封建社会内已经孕育着资本主义的萌芽。这样就更推动了戏剧的发展。不但剧种多，而且戏剧——特别是南戏——的规模达到完备的阶段。戏剧的内容也反映了反抗传统的封建意识而追求个性解放的理想。如徐渭的“女状元”赞美妇女的才能，汤显祖的“牡丹亭”歌颂真挚的爱情，和明末清初的小说都有相同的主题思想。
    明末清初最流行的戏有“弋阳腔”“昆山腔”（昆曲）等。昆山腔可以说集南戏的大成。十八世纪中叶，昆山腔渐衰，而“皮黄戏”（西皮”、“二黄”）代之而兴，这就是京剧的前身。明清两代的乐谱保留下来的很多，而且有许多乐曲依然流传在民间。
    丰富的音乐遗产正等待我们搜集清理。据查夷平先生说，几年来，仅中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所收集的民间乐曲和歌谣就有三万首；经初步研究，知道里面有不少的明清以前的乐曲。这项工作需要继续开展。希望音乐工作者选择历史遗产中的适用部分，加以整理、发扬，创造具有民族风格的新作品，来反映我们的伟大时代，给幸福的祖国人民带来更大的鼓舞和喜悦。
