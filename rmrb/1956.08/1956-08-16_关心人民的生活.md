Food Arrives by Plane

The flood submerged houses, leaving only rooftops and treetops visible. The people of Zhongqiao Township, Yu杭 County, Zhejiang Province, suffered from a flood unprecedented in seventy years. The victims were left to sleep on raised embankments and small hills. By the morning of August 4th, they had gone hungry for several meals.

Suddenly, the faint sound of a plane "rumbling" could be heard from the eastern sky, and then two silver-white airplanes appeared. The planes circled in the air. Suddenly, packages were dropped from the windows of the plane. People rushed over to pick them up, and couldn't help but exclaim: "Oh, it's stir-fried rice, it's white steamed buns!" "Chairman Mao sent planes to bring us food!"

No sooner said than done, in less than half an hour, the two planes dropped more than a hundred packages of fried rice and steamed buns. People began to eat greedily. Oh! The fried rice and steamed buns were still warm! Just like they were freshly made. Zheng Youming, a six-year-old child who was whimpering and crying about being hungry next to his mother, immediately smiled when he stuffed a large steamed bun into his small mouth. An old farmer in his eighties from the Su Ming Agricultural Cooperative, whose stomach was growling with hunger, ate six soft and fluffy steamed buns in one go, saying, "These steamed buns also contain Chairman Mao's good intentions!"

With tears of gratitude, the victims bid farewell to the planes sent by Chairman Mao. These planes also boosted the confidence of the victims in overcoming the difficulties of the disaster. At this moment, the flood had begun to recede. That afternoon, on the threshing floor, people were busy turning over the rice that had been soaked by the flood; on the riverbank, young people were herding flocks of ducks. Lin Yongnian

No Longer Helpless

Since its establishment in May of this year, the Fenyang Reform Through Labor Institute in Shanxi Province has taken in a total of forty-seven helpless disabled elderly and orphaned children, who are now living a happy and enjoyable life in their later years.

Deng Qinghe, a 61-year-old man, had been a stove maker since he was a child and suffered all his life. The old society's reward to him was "a body full of disabilities;" Gao Genlong, a 76-year-old single man, had been selling his labor since he was sixteen, but was so poor that he never married. When they recalled the scenes of these painful lives, they couldn't help but shed tears.

However, in today's new society, they receive the close care of the People's Government. In the Fenyang Reform Through Labor Institute, they live in brand-new houses, and their tattered clothes and quilts have been replaced with new ones. For the disabled elderly who have difficulty moving, someone brings them food and water; in addition, there are special people who read newspapers to them on time, explain national events and health knowledge, and so on. School-age children in this Reform Through Labor Institute also attend school.

These helpless people cannot help but be moved by such a happy life. An old man named Wei Renhe once expressed a poem-like feeling at a meeting: "The Reform Through Labor Institute is really good, the clothes and quilts are new, we eat our fill, we have no lice on our bodies, we are not bitten by mosquitoes at night, we are mentally happy and have fewer diseases, we can never repay the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even if we die."

More Caring Than One's Own Parents

I work in the Seventh Porcelain Cooperative in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province. My husband is a farmer. We originally had three children. In July of this year, I gave birth to triplets. At that time, I was really worried, because according to our income, the sudden addition of three children would make it difficult to feed the newborns and to manage the family's life. My husband was not by my side, and I had no one to discuss it with. Just when I was as anxious as an "ant on a hot pot," the director of the Jingdezhen United Cooperative, the secretary of the general branch of the Seventh Porcelain Cooperative, the secretary of the Communist Youth League general branch, and many other comrades came to see me, gave me 110 yuan, and told me, "The organization will take care of your life in the future," and asked me to rest assured and recuperate. Then, comrades from the Jingdezhen Newspaper and the Jingdezhen Women's Federation came, took photos of the children, and I was so moved that I shed tears. I felt that the care and concern of the Party and the government for me was even closer than that of my own parents! Yu Meile (with picture)

    关心人民的生活
    飞机送来了食物
    洪水淹没了房屋，只露出了屋顶和树梢。浙江省余杭县中桥乡一带人民遭受了七十年来未有过的洪水的灾害。灾民们露宿在凸出的高塘和小山坡上。到八月四日早上，已经饿了好几顿饭了。
    突然，东边天空隐隐约约地传来了飞机“隆隆”的响声，接着两架银白色的飞机出现了。飞机在半空中盘旋着。忽然，在机窗口投下了一包包的东西。人们窜奔过去，拾起来一看，不禁大声叫起来：“喔，是熟炒米，是白馒头！”“是毛主席派飞机给我们送吃食来了！”
    说时迟，那时快，不到半个钟头，这两架飞机就投下了一百多包炒米和馒头。人们便贪馋地吃起来了。哟！炒米和馒头还有一股热气哪！就像刚刚做出来的一样。本来倚在妈妈身边呜咽着叫喊肚饿的六岁孩子郑幼明，把大馒头一塞进小嘴吧里，顿时开了笑脸。苏明农业社的一个近八十岁的老农民，肚子饿得咕咕叫，他一口气吃了六只又松又软的大馒头，说：“这馒头里面还包含着毛主席的一片心意哩！”
    灾民们含着感激的泪水，送别了毛主席派来的飞机。这飞机，还鼓起了灾民克服灾害困难的信心。此刻，洪水已经开始退了，当天下午，在晒场上，人们忙碌着翻晒被洪水浸湿了的稻谷；在河边上，青年人在放饲鸭群。　　　林永年
    不再无依无靠了
    山西省汾阳教养院，从今年五月份成立以来，一共收容了无依无靠的残老、孤幼四十七人，现在他们都过着幸福而愉快的晚年。
    六十一岁的邓庆贺老汉，从小就做炉匠，受了一辈子苦，旧社会给他的报酬是“满身残疾”；七十六岁的独身老汉高根龙，虽然从十六岁就出卖劳动力，却穷得一直没有结婚。当他们追述这些痛苦生活的情景时，都不禁流下泪来。
    可是，在今天的新社会里，他们受到人民政府亲切的关怀。在汾阳教养院里他们住上了崭新的房屋，破衣、烂被都换成新衣、新被。对那些行动不便的残废老人，有人给端饭、送水；另外，还有专人按时给他们读报，讲解国家大事和卫生常识等等。在这个教养院的学龄儿童也都上了学。
    这些无依无靠的人们，不能不为这样的幸福生活所感动，有一个叫蔚仁和的老人，曾在一个会上发表了一段诗一般的感想：“教养院，真是好，衣被新，吃得饱，身上虱子没有了，晚上睡觉不受蚊虫咬，精神愉快疾病少，共产党和毛主席的恩情死也报不了。”

    比爷娘还亲
    我在江西景德镇第七瓷器社工作，我的丈夫是个农民，原来我们就有三个孩子，今年七月，我一胎又生了三个孩子。当时我真耽心，因为根据我们的收入情况，一下子添了三个孩子，新生孩子的吃奶问题以及一家人的生活问题都将会发生困难，我的丈夫又不在我身边，连个商量的人都没有。当我正急得像“热锅上的蚂蚁”的时候，景德镇市联社主任、第七瓷器社党总支书记、团总支书记和其他许多同志都来看我了，还给我送了一百一十元，并告诉我：“今后生活问题，组织上会照顾”，叫我安心休养身体。接着，景德镇报社、景德镇市妇联的同志都来了，还给小孩拍了照，我真感动得流下泪来，我感到党和政府对我的关心和照顾比我亲生爷娘还亲呢！　　　　余妹仂（附图片）
