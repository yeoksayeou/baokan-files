Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: Yang Rui, Secretary of the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the city's second quarterly meeting of advanced producer representatives on the 6th: The advanced producer movement must be closely centered on the goal of guaranteeing the comprehensive and early fulfillment of the national Five-Year Plan; otherwise, it will lose its practical significance.

Yang Rui said: In the past stage, the advanced producer movement has been unprecedented in terms of mass participation, ideological mobilization, improvement and enhancement of leadership, and economic results compared to previous production movements. However, on the other hand, the completion of the state plan by factories and mines throughout the city was generally poor during this period. Of the seventeen major products of state-owned factories and local industries in the first half of the year, five did not meet the state plan; the product quality of several major factories and mines did not meet national standards, and the Huaxin Cement Plant even experienced serious quality accidents. In addition, personal and equipment accidents were very serious during this period.

Yang Rui further analyzed the reasons for this phenomenon, saying: The most fundamental and universal reason is that the leadership of various factories and mines lacks a sufficient understanding of the purpose of carrying out the advanced producer movement. The movement was not closely and effectively centered on the goal of ensuring the comprehensive, early, and over-fulfillment of the national Five-Year Plan, but was carried out in isolation, with empty slogans, leading to formalism. This deviation is manifested in the failure to implement the comprehensive policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" proposed by the Central Committee in conjunction with the actual conditions of each unit, and in the failure to distinguish between the priority and the secondary. Although "more, faster, better, and more economical" were repeatedly mentioned, the workers and masses still did not understand the specific direction of current production, or how to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical."

Secondly, in terms of promoting advanced experience and carrying out rationalization proposals, many units either blindly pursued quantity or mechanically copied, resulting in failure to widely promote them, or promotion without solving the key problems in production. Some units did a good job of promotion at the beginning, but later relaxed their efforts, leading to formalism. As for carrying out rationalization proposals, because the factory and mine leaders did not put forward topics based on the key issues in production, the rationalization proposals were numerous but of low quality and rarely adopted. In addition, the untimely handling and implementation of the rationalization proposals further greatly reduced their practical effect.

Yang Rui said: The questions of how to give play to the role of administrative institutions and how to improve leadership methods in the advanced producer movement are still at the level of generalized slogans and forms. The number of people sitting in offices all day without going out has been greatly reduced; but how to go deeper? Where to go deeper, and what is the effect? Has not been well resolved, so even if the leading cadres go down, it will not help the actual situation.

In addition, in terms of consolidating and expanding the ranks of advanced producers, the one-sided emphasis on quantity led to many units lowering standards in the second quarter's evaluation of advanced producers, and even individual false advanced producers emerged. There was also a phenomenon of original advanced producers lagging behind due to poor management.

Yang Rui finally emphasized: In order to carry out the city's advanced producer movement in a deep and lasting way, the primary task at present is to strengthen the leadership of the movement, especially to clearly recognize that the purpose of this movement is to guarantee the comprehensive and early fulfillment of the national Five-Year Plan. In the movement, all work such as promoting advanced experience, carrying out rationalization proposals, changing leadership methods and styles, giving play to the role of administrative institutions, and consolidating and expanding the ranks of advanced producers should be closely centered on this goal, and workers should be educated and work should be inspected at any time in accordance with this basic spirit.

He asked the leading cadres of various factories and mines to promptly point out new and specific goals of struggle to the workers and masses in the movement, according to the different problems existing in different periods. At the same time, they should conscientiously learn from the experience of Wuhan's production inspection system, go deep into the key problems in production, solve problems, summarize experiences, and enable the movement to continuously develop and improve.

    加强领导先进生产者运动
    黄石市委批判空喊口号孤立地搞运动的缺点要求紧密围绕完成国家计划的目的开展运动
    新华社武汉12日电　中共黄石市委书记杨锐在六日召开的全市第二季度先进生产者代表会议上指出：先进生产者运动，必须紧密地围绕着保证全面和提前完成国家五年计划这一目的进行，否则，就失去了它的实际意义。
    杨锐说：过去一个阶段的先进生产者运动，无论在群众规模、思想发动，改进与提高领导工作，以及经济效果等方面，都是过去历次生产运动所不及的；但是在另一方面，这时期全市各厂矿对国家计划普遍完成得不好。上半年国营厂矿和地方工业的十七种主要产品，有五种没有完成国家计划；几个主要厂矿的产品质量没有达到国家指标，华新水泥厂还曾经发生过严重的质量事故。此外，人身事故和设备事故，在这期间也很严重。
    杨锐进一步分析造成这种现象的原因说：最根本而带有普遍性的原因，是各厂矿领导方面对开展先进生产者运动的目的性认识不足，没有使运动紧密地和切实地围绕着保证全面、提前和超额完成国家五年计划这一目的去进行，而只是孤立地去搞运动，空喊口号，以致使运动流于形式。这种偏向表现在对待中央提出的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的全面方针，没有结合各个单位的实际情况加以具体地贯彻执行，没有分清轻重主次。虽然反复地讲“多、快、好、省”，但是职工群众仍然不明白当前生产中的具体方向何在，如何做到“多、快、好、省”。
    其次，是在推广先进经验和开展合理化建议工作方面。许多单位在推广先进经验的时候，或则盲目贪多，或则生搬硬套，结果都是推而不广，推广了而不能解决生产中的关键问题；也有的是开始推广工作做得很好，后来却放松不管，使之流于形式。至于开展合理化建议的工作，由于厂矿领导方面没有根据生产中的关键提出课题，便形成合理化建议数量多、质量低、采纳少，再加上对已经提出的合理化建议处理和实现不及时，更大大减少了它的实际效果。
    杨锐说：在先进生产者运动中如何发挥行政机构的作用和如何改进领导方法这两个问题上，目前也还是停留在一般化的口号和形式上。目前整天坐在办公室不出门的人是大大减少了；但是如何深入？深入到哪里，效果如何？却没有很好的解决，因而领导干部即使下去了，也无补于实际。
    此外，在巩固和扩大先进生产者队伍方面，由于片面强调数量，以致在第二季度的评比先进生产者工作中，有不少单位降低标准，甚至出了个别假的先进生产者。原有的先进生产者也有因为管理不好而落后的现象。
    杨锐最后强调指出：为了使全市先进生产者运动深入持久地开展下去，当前首要的一环是加强对运动的领导，特别是明确地认识到这个运动的目的是为了保证全面和提前完成国家五年计划。在运动中所有推广先进经验、开展合理化建议、改变领导方法和作风、发挥行政机构的作用、巩固和扩大先进生产者队伍等工作，都要紧密地围绕着这一目标来进行，并且要随时按照这个基本精神教育职工，检查工作。
    他要求各厂矿领导干部在运动中应根据不同时期所存在的不同问题，及时向职工群众指出新的、具体的奋斗目标；同时，要认真学习武汉市生产巡回制度的经验，深入到生产中的关键问题上去，解决问题，总结经验，使运动得以不断的发展和提高。
