Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 12th: The Burmese National United Front issued a statement on August 11th regarding the Sino-Burmese border issue, supporting the spirit of the Burmese and Chinese governments in resolving this issue through consultation.

The statement said, "We know that the Government of the Union of Burma and the Government of the People's Republic of China have different views on the Wa State border issue. We have also seen the activities of some countries that have nothing to do with this issue attempting to interfere." The statement pointed out that these countries are those Southeast Asian aggressive bloc countries that undermine the solidarity of the Asian people.

The statement said that the Sino-Burmese border issue is a purely bilateral issue between the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China. The governments and peoples of both Burma and China are peace-loving, committed to the solidarity of Asian countries, and have established friendly relations between the two countries. They are also countries that have declared the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. On this basis, the governments of Burma and China have expressed their desire to resolve this issue through consultation.

The Burmese National United Front warmly supports this spirit of consultation.

The statement concluded by saying that in light of the current situation, the Burmese National United Front will stand with the Burmese people to crush the conspiracies of those who interfere, play with fire, create incidents, and undermine peace on the issue between Burma and China.

    缅甸民族团结阵线发表声明
    支持协商解决缅中边界问题的精神
    新华社仰光12日电　缅甸民族团结阵线八月十一日就缅中边界问题发表一项声明，支持缅中两国政府采取协商方式解决这一问题的精神。
    声明说，我们知道缅甸联邦政府和中华人民共和国政府对瓦邦边界问题的看法有不同之点。我们也看到一些同这个问题毫无关系的国家企图进行干涉的活动。声明指出，这些国家就是那些破坏亚洲人民团结的东南亚侵略集团国家。
    声明说，缅中边界问题是一个纯粹属于缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国两国之间的问题。缅中两国政府和人民都是热爱和平、致力于亚洲国家的团结并且在两国间建立了友好关系的国家，同时也是宣布了和平共处五项原则的国家。在这个基础上，缅中两国政府都表示了要以协商方式解决这个问题。
    缅甸民族团结阵线热烈支持这种协商问题的精神。
    声明最后说，缅甸民族团结阵线针对目前情况，将同缅甸人民站在一起，粉碎那些在缅中两国之间的问题上进行干涉玩火、制造事件和破坏和平的阴谋活动。
