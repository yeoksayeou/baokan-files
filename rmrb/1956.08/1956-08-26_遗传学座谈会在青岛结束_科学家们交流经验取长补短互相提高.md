Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 25th. The Genetics Symposium concluded in Qingdao today.

This symposium marked the first contact between Chinese Michurin genetics workers and Mendel-Morgan genetics workers. After more than ten days of discussion, both sides exchanged experiences, achieving the effect of learning from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, and improving together. This was stated by Tong Dizhou, Deputy Director of the Department of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at the final meeting of the symposium this morning.

Tong Dizhou pointed out that other achievements of this symposium were: enthusiastic speeches, with most scientists speaking their minds without concerns or reservations; the provision of a great deal of written scientific material, with mutual opinions offered on each other's research work; a relatively detailed discussion of many issues; and the clarification of the interrelationships and positions of various disciplines related to genetics. These gains will be very helpful and enlightening for future genetic research work in China.

Tong Dizhou pointed out that this symposium has initially accumulated concrete experience in implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy. He believes that the shortcomings of this symposium are: the speeches were not very focused; although some scientists prepared a lot of materials, generally speaking, everyone's preparation was not sufficient; and at the same time, they could not present more of their own research results for discussion, so the discussion of some issues could not be very profound.

Since the symposium began on August 10th, according to the planned schedule, it discussed the material basis of heredity, the relationship between the environment and genetic variation, individual development and systemic development, and future genetics teaching and research work.

On the 24th, the symposium discussed the issue of genetics teaching and research work. Most people advocated that the genetics curriculum in universities should comprehensively introduce the genetics of the Michurin school and the Mendel-Morgan school, and put forward various different views on curriculum arrangement, teaching syllabus revision, etc., hoping that the Ministry of Higher Education will study and decide. Regarding the basic Darwinism course in middle schools, everyone believes that the level of middle school students is not yet sufficient to accept such a highly theoretical course.

Regarding genetic research work, most people suggested that the Department of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should establish a genetics academic committee; the Genetics Research Office of the Institute of Botany should strive to expand into a Genetics Institute in the coming years. At the same time, everyone also suggested: actively train graduate students in genetics in the Academy of Sciences, universities, and agricultural and forestry research institutions; send people to study abroad; and invite foreign geneticists to give lectures in our country.

    遗传学座谈会在青岛结束
    科学家们交流经验取长补短互相提高
    新华社青岛25日电　遗传学座谈会今天在青岛结束。
    这次座谈会使中国的米丘林遗传学工作者和孟德尔、摩尔根遗传学工作者有了首次的接触。经过十多天的讨论，双方交流了经验，收到了取长补短，互相提高的效果。这是中国科学院生物学地学部副主任童第周今天上午在座谈会的最后一次会议上说的。
    童第周指出，这次座谈会的其他成就是：发言热烈、科学家大多无顾虑、无保留地畅说了心里话；提供了许多书面的科学资料，对各人的研究工作互相提出了意见；对许多问题进行了较详细的探讨；明确了同遗传学关连的各学科的相互关系和它们的地位，这些收获，对将来中国的遗传学研究工作很有帮助和启发作用。
    童第周指出，这次座谈会初步积累了具体贯彻百家争鸣方针的经验。他认为这次座谈会的缺点是：发言不很集中；虽然有些科学家准备了很多资料，但一般说来大家准备不够充分；同时不能拿出更多的自己的研究成果来讨论，因此对于有些问题的讨论不能很深刻。
    座谈会从八月十日开始以来，按照预定计划，讨论了遗传的物质基础、环境同遗传变异的关系、个体发育和系统发育、今后遗传学教学和研究工作等问题。
    二十四日座谈会讨论了遗传学教学和研究工作问题。大多数人主张在大学遗传学课程中应该比较全面的介绍米丘林学派和孟德尔、摩尔根学派的遗传学，并对课程安排，教学大纲的修正等提出了各种不同的看法，希望高等教育部研究决定。关于中学里的达尔文主义基础课程，大家认为中学生的水平还不够接受这样一门理论性较高的课程。
    关于遗传学研究工作，多数人建议中国科学院生物学地学部设立遗传学学术委员会；植物研究所遗传研究室应争取在近年内扩建为遗传研究所。同时，大家还建议：要积极在科学院、高等学校和农林研究机构培养遗传学研究生；派人到外国学习；聘请国外遗传学家来我国讲学。
