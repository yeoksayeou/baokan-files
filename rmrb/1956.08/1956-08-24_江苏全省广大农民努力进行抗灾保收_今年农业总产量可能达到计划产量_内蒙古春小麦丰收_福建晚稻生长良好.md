Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 23rd: Jiangsu Province, which has been hit by continuous rain, floods, and typhoons, has, under the leadership of the People's Government, mobilized the broad masses of farmers to fight disasters and ensure harvests. Currently, over 90 million mu of autumn-ripening crops are growing well. The harvested early rice has caught up with last year's harvest. It is estimated that the province's total agricultural output this year is still likely to reach the state-planned output.

The average yield per mu of the 700,000 mu of double-cropping early rice already harvested in Jiangsu Province is over 450 jin. The over 5 million mu of single-cropping early rice that is being harvested, with the exception of some areas where yields were reduced due to threshing caused by typhoon strikes, still has an average yield of about 400 jin per mu in most areas, and the total output still catches up with last year's harvest. The more than 30 million mu of mid-season rice and late japonica rice are growing strongly. Among them, some mid-season rice has been affected by typhoons and is estimated to be reduced by about 10%. At present, the mid-season rice is growing vigorously and is expected to be harvested in more than a month. The more than 16 million mu of late japonica rice is also growing very well. The double-cropping late rice, which was rushed to be planted before and after the typhoon, has caught up with the single-cropping late rice in terms of growth. According to the person in charge of the Department of Agriculture, if pest control work is tightened in the next two months and there are no special natural disasters, there are sufficient conditions to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season and late rice.

The growth of nearly 30 million mu of miscellaneous grains in the province varies. The early corn, which is being harvested, has a large disparity in yield. The good ones can harvest about 300 jin per mu, while the poor ones only harvest dozens of jin. The nearly 20 million mu of late corn and sweet potatoes have been continuously raining recently, and their growth has turned vigorous.

After the typhoon in Jiangsu Province this year, the cotton plants tilted, and there were more fallen flowers and buds, resulting in a certain degree of loss. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, among the more than 11 million mu of cotton in the province, 10 million mu are in the peak flowering and boll-forming period. If we seize the opportunity to strengthen fertilizer application and pest control to protect flowers and buds, there are still conditions to strive for a bumper cotton harvest.

The more than 10 million mu of oil crops that Jiangsu Province expanded its planting area this year can harvest more than 1.1 billion jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 23rd: More than 8 million mu of spring wheat in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a bumper harvest. According to the materials reported by various regions, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region estimates that the average yield of wheat in the region can reach 140 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30 jin compared with last year. The Hetao Plain, famous for its water conservancy irrigation, is 30% higher than last year's bumper harvest. Some areas are as high as 700 jin per mu, with an average of about 240 jin per mu.

The total wheat output of the entire autonomous region this year has completed and exceeded the unit area output and total output targets of the first Five-Year Plan. The total output reached 589,000 tons, an increase of more than 124,000 tons compared with last year.

Areas with sufficient water and fertilizer have replanted early-maturing crops such as buckwheat in the wheat stubble after harvesting the wheat. The replanting area in the Hetao Plain will reach one-third of the wheat field area.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 23rd: Late rice in Fujian Province is growing well. In Longxi, Haicheng, Changle and other high-yield grain areas, the late rice planted earlier is already more than one foot high and very lush.

At present, most of the late rice fields in the province have been weeded once and fertilized. The farmers are continuing to vigorously accumulate manure and strive to apply more fertilizer to make up for the losses caused by the drought.

According to the statistics of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture on the 22nd, the province has now planted 3.6 million mu of double-cropping late rice and single-cropping late rice, a slight increase compared with last year's summer planting area.

This summer, Fujian Province encountered a rare drought in recent years. 170,000 mu of paddy fields in the province could not be planted due to severe drought. At present, farmers are replanting these fields with dryland crops such as overwintering sweet potatoes, autumn soybeans, and potatoes.

    江苏全省广大农民努力进行抗灾保收
    今年农业总产量可能达到计划产量
    内蒙古春小麦丰收　福建晚稻生长良好
    据新华社南京23日电　曾连续遭受雨涝和台风等自然灾害的江苏省，经过人民政府领导广大农民抗灾保收，现在全省九千多万亩秋熟作物，大都生长良好。已经收割的早稻，赶上去年的收成。估计今年全省农业总产量仍有可能达到国家计划的产量。
    江苏省已经收割的七十万亩双季早稻平均单位面积产量在四百五十斤以上。正在收割的五百多万亩单季早稻，除部分地区因台风袭击脱粒减产外，大部分地区单位面积产量仍在四百斤左右，总产量仍旧赶上去年的收成。三千多万亩中熟稻和晚粳稻，生长健壮，其中部分中熟稻因受到了台风的袭击，估计要减产10％左右。目前中熟稻生长较旺，预计一个多月后就可以收割了。一千六百多万亩晚粳稻生长也非常好。台风前后抢栽下去的双季晚稻，生长较好的已赶上单季晚稻。据农业厅负责人估计：今后两个月，只要治虫工作抓得紧，没有特殊的自然灾害，有充分条件争取中熟稻和晚稻丰收。
    全省近三千万亩杂粮作物生长情况有好有坏，正在收割的早玉米，产量高低悬殊较大，好的每亩收有三百斤左右，差的只有几十斤。种植近两千万亩的晚玉米、甘薯，近来连续得雨，生长转旺。
    江苏省今年棉花在台风过后，棉株倾斜，落花落蕾较多，遭到一定程度的损失。据江苏省农业厅估计：目前全省一千一百多万亩棉花，有一千万亩正是盛花结铃期间，今后抓紧施肥治虫工作，保花保蕾，争取棉花丰收还是有条件的。
    江苏省今年扩大播种的一千多万亩油料作物可以收获十一亿多斤。
    新华社呼和浩特23日电　内蒙古自治区八百多万亩春小麦丰收。内蒙古自治区农牧厅根据各地区汇报材料预计，全区小麦平均每亩能收一百四十斤，比去年增加三十多斤。以水利灌溉闻名的河套平原比丰收的去年还要高出三成，有的地区每亩高达七百斤以上，平均每亩达到二百四十斤左右。
    全自治区今年小麦产量已完成并超过了第一个五年计划的单位面积产量和总产量指标。总产量达到五十八万九千吨。比去年增产十二万四千多吨。
    水源肥料充足地区在收完小麦后，已在麦茬中复种荞麦等早熟作物。河套平原的复种面积将达麦田面积的三分之一。
    新华社福州23日电　福建省晚稻生长良好。粮食高产地区的龙溪、海澄、长乐等地，插秧较早的晚稻已经一尺多高，十分茂盛。
    现在，全省大部分晚稻田已经耘过一次草，追过肥料。农民们在继续大力积肥，争取多追施肥料，弥补因旱而造成的损失。
    据福建省农业厅在二十二日的统计，全省现已插下双季晚稻和单季晚稻三百六十万亩，与去年的夏种面积相比，略有增加。
    今年夏天，福建省遭遇到近几年来少见的大旱，全省十七万亩水田因受旱严重，不能插秧。目前，农民们正在这些田里改种过冬甘薯或秋大豆、马铃薯等旱地作物。
