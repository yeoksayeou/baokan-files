As an aircraft model enthusiast, who wouldn't hope to ride in a real airplane! Yesterday—on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, more than one hundred young aviation model enthusiasts from the capital, along with young actors from the Chinese Opera School and the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe training classes, were warmly hosted by Air Force uncles from a certain Air Force unit. The young guests took turns riding in airplanes painted with the characters "August 1st."

When the airplane was flying steadily over the capital, Sun Jingqiao, a young aviation enthusiast, jumped up from his seat in the cabin with joy, watching the rows of streets and houses on the ground shrinking in size. How could he not be happy? He had made many wooden and paper airplane models in the past four years, and this was his first time sitting in a real airplane. His level-three towed glider scored "full marks" in a recent test held by the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission. In the cabin, several airplane model makers surrounded the navigator uncle, asking a series of strange questions they thought of and saw. They all received satisfactory answers.

After the airplane ride, the young guests began to celebrate with the Air Force uncles. At the gathering, the young guests presented the Air Force uncles with a silk banner they had made themselves, as well as airplane models specially made for the Air Force uncles by the Beijing Children's Palace, Children's Home, and young aviation enthusiasts from various middle schools in Beijing.

At the celebration, the children and the Air Force uncles enjoyed music, dance, acrobatics, Peking opera and other programs performed by the young actors.

    和空军叔叔联欢
    邢克
    作为一个飞机模型制造爱好者，谁还不盼望能乘坐一下真正的飞机呢！昨天——“八一”建军节前夕，首都一百多少年航空模型爱好者和中国戏曲学校、中国杂技团学员班的小演员，受到空军某部空军叔叔殷勤招待，小客人们分批乘坐了漆着“八一”字样的飞机。
    当飞机平稳地飞行在首都上空的时候，少年航空爱好者孙景桥，望着地上一排排变小了的街道和房屋，高兴得从机舱座位上跳了起来。他怎能不高兴呢？他在最近四年里做过不少木头和纸糊的飞机模型，这次还是第一次坐上真正的飞机；他制作的三级牵引滑翔机，在最近北京市体育运动委员会举行的测验中得了“满分”。在机舱中，几个飞机模型制造者围着领航员叔叔，提出一连串他们想起、看到的奇异问题。都得到了满意的解答。
    乘坐飞机后，小客人开始和空军叔叔们联欢。会上，小客人献给空军叔叔一面他们自己制造的锦旗，和北京少年宫、少年之家、北京各中学少年航空爱好者特意为空军叔叔赶制的飞机模型。
    联欢会上，小朋友和空军叔叔一起欣赏了小演员们演出的音乐、舞蹈、杂技、京剧等节目。
