Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 3rd. A hundred-plus outstanding middle school teachers in Shanghai have accepted positions as lecturers and teaching assistants at universities. They are working hard to prepare lessons with the help of senior university teachers, preparing for their new teaching tasks.

Most of these teachers have been teaching for ten or twenty years, with rich teaching experience and professional knowledge. Their departure from middle schools will not significantly affect the teaching work of their original schools.

Some of these teachers were transferred from universities to middle schools during the university department adjustments, or were teachers who had previously taught at universities. Among the thirteen English teachers who were hired to teach at Shanghai First and Second Normal Colleges, nine had previously worked as university teachers.

These teachers will be teaching basic courses such as mathematics, physics, biology, and English at universities.

    上海一批中学教师到高等学校任教
    据新华社上海3日电　上海一百多个优秀中学教师应聘到高等学校担任讲师和助教，他们正在高等学校老教师帮助下加紧备课，迎接新的教学任务。
    这些教师大都已任教十多年或二十多年，有着丰富的教学经验和专业知识。他们离开中学以后，原来学校的教学工作不致受到很大的影响。
    这些教师中有一部分是在高等学校院系调整时，从高等学校调到中学去任教，或过去曾在大学任教的教师。被聘到上海第一、第二师范学院教课的十三位英语教师中，有九人过去曾做过大学教师。
    这些教师将在高等学校担任数学、物理、生物、英语等基础课程的教学工作。
