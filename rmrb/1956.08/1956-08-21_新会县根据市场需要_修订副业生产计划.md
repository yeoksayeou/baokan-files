Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 19th: Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has appropriately revised its plan for diversified sideline production in the second half of the year based on market needs. According to the new plan, the livestock and poultry industries, which are generally in demand in the market, will be actively developed. Among them, the number of pigs required will increase by 31,500, about 25% more than the original plan. The planting area of ​​radishes and cabbages, which are restricted by sales, will be appropriately reduced, while the planting area of ​​hairy gourds, bitter gourds, and cucumbers, which have better sales and are suitable for long-distance transportation, will be expanded compared with the original plan.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperativization in Xinhui County this spring, due to the lack of comprehensive research on production and sales, the diversified sideline production was not well-arranged with corresponding specific arrangements, resulting in a phenomenon of surplus of some products and insufficient supply of other products. For example, the output of wax gourds and pumpkins was more than ten times higher than in previous years, resulting in some products being unsaleable and causing losses.

    新会县根据市场需要
    修订副业生产计划
    新华社广州19日电　广东省新会县根据市场的需要，适当修订了全县下半年多种经营副业生产的计划。按照新的计划，市场普遍需要的家畜、家禽业将积极发展，其中猪要求新增加三万一千五百头，比原计划多出约25％；受销路限制的萝卜和椰菜的种植面积适当缩小，而销路较好和适宜远运的毛瓜、苦瓜和青瓜的种植面积将比原计划扩大。
    新会县在今年春天实现农业合作化后，由于对生产和销售情况缺乏全面的研究，副业生产多种经营没有作好相适应的具体安排，造成一些产品过剩、另一些产品供不应求的现象。例如冬瓜和南瓜的产量比往年多了十倍多，结果部分产品卖不出去，造成损失。
