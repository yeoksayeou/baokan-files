　　The representatives who attended the Henan Province Mountain Area Work Conference recently raised many opinions on the current mountain area work. These opinions reflect the urgent demands of the broad masses of people in the mountainous areas.

　　The representatives universally demanded that the leadership of mountain area work be improved, especially to be led according to the characteristics of the mountain areas and the special requirements of the people in the mountain areas. The representatives said that during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the Party and the government led the people in the mountain areas through the most difficult days, but now the work in the mountain areas has been relaxed. The representatives pointed out that the leaders in many areas do not conduct in-depth investigations and research to help solve the most pressing problems. Instead, they adopt the same leadership methods as in the plains to lead the work in the mountain areas. When the people in the mountain areas raise opinions, they do not humbly consider, study, and improve the leadership, but complain that the people in the mountain areas are now backward and "disobedient." For example, during the farmland water conservancy campaign launched in the province this spring, many areas that were not suitable for digging wells were forced to dig wells, resulting in the wells becoming waterless and abandoned. This spring, Luan Chuan County ordered Tong Zi Zhuang Township to dig eighty wells. The township cadres said, "How can wells be dug in the mountains?" But the county cadres said, "The high tide of socialism has arrived, and you are still so backward?" As a result, only two of the ten wells dug in the township had water. The masses in Yi Yuan Township said: "Eight wells were dug, and seven were wasted; the one that was dug can only irrigate two fen of land." This has caused great waste to the people in the mountainous areas.

　　This year, the Xin Xiang Special District formulated agricultural technical regulations without considering the production conditions in the mountain areas, and did not put forward requirements that were in line with the farming conditions in the mountain areas. Instead, it required the mountain areas to be the same as the plains. For example, it was stipulated that cotton must grow to thirteen fruit branches before topping, but experienced farmers in the mountains reflected that they can only grow up to eight fruit branches at most. The cadres leading the production insisted that the masses top the cotton when it reaches thirteen fruit branches. The masses said: "It will take two years to grow to thirteen fruit branches!" Ma Yu Chuan Township in Deng Feng County is a mountainous area, and everywhere there are narrow, uneven paths, making it difficult to walk with hand-pushed carts. However, this spring, cadres from the county supply and marketing cooperative sold horse-drawn carts to the agricultural cooperatives. When the cooperative cadres did not want them, they were criticized for having "low socialist awareness." The representatives said that this spring, many supply and marketing cooperatives in the mountain areas vigorously promoted large agricultural implements such as double-铧ploughs, horse-drawn harvesters, and waterwheels, but small agricultural implements such as mulberry forks, brooms, hoes, and ploughshares were often not supplied. The supply and marketing cooperative in Biao Chi Township in Xi Xia County promoted seven double-铧ploughs and two waterwheels, but the largest piece of cultivated land in this township is only one mu and two fen in size, and there is no well, resulting in waste.

　　In terms of culture, education, and health, the representatives from the mountain areas also raised many opinions. For example, primary school education stipulates that thirty students are required to form a class, and those over sixteen years of age cannot enroll. Life in the mountains is very hard, but the teachers' salaries are very low, and so on. The representatives said that the mountainous areas are sparsely populated, with villages of only a few or dozens of households, and villages are far apart. How can more than thirty children be gathered? Moreover, people in the mountain areas enroll later, and many people want to enroll after the age of sixteen, but they are not allowed to enroll.

　　Cultural backwardness and disease are the greatest pain currently felt by the people in the mountain areas. They urgently request cultural, educational, and health workers to help them get rid of this situation. For example, there are few literate people in the mountain areas, and no one can write couplets for the New Year and festivals. Many of the couplets pasted by the masses in the Fu Niu Mountains in Xi Xia County have only circles drawn on them, and some only have blank red paper pasted on them. Now that the mountainous areas have realized cooperativization, many cooperatives cannot find accountants or work recorders. According to a survey in Huang Long Township in Nei Xiang County, only two out of the 454 people in the township are literate. In the mountainous areas of Luan Chuan County, eleven townships, nine could not find accountants for their cooperatives, which seriously affects the management and development of these cooperatives.

　　Many endemic diseases in the mountain areas have long harmed the health and happiness of the people. According to a survey, there are as many as seventeen types of local diseases in the Fu Niu Mountains, including goiter, syphilis, and arthritis. Many diseases are very common, such as goiter, which is everywhere. Many families are all sick. In severe cases, the neck is thicker than the head, making it difficult to speak and move, and impossible to work. The representatives from the mountain areas requested that the cultural and educational departments and health departments vigorously dispatch cadres to the mountains to conduct investigations and research, and help the people in the mountain areas improve their culture according to the situation in the mountain areas. They should vigorously carry out the prevention and treatment of various diseases, and gradually eliminate various historical diseases.

　　Mountain areas have extremely rich resources, and many local specialties are urgently needed materials for the current national construction. However, in the past, economic workers did not provide enough support for the mountain areas. The representatives from the mountain areas also raised many opinions on this point. For example, the silkworm silk in Nan Yang Special District lacks the support of economic and technical departments, and the current production level is only a quarter of the highest level before the war. Luan Chuan County has eight major local specialties, and medicine alone has more than eighty kinds, but currently only more than forty kinds are purchased. Luan Chuan is a famous producing area of monkey head mushrooms, but now, due to the fact that no one has purchased them for a long time, the masses no longer engage in production, and this delicacy cannot be bought in Luan Chuan city either. The representatives from the mountain areas requested that the transportation departments build more roads to the mountain areas so that the local specialties of the mountain areas can be transported out. They also requested that banks increase loan support, production departments help improve technology, and purchasing departments conduct a general survey of local specialty production and carry out purchases to comprehensively help the mountain areas develop production.

　　The representatives from the mountain areas have great opinions on the fact that the tax departments still use the previous tax collection methods after the realization of cooperativization. This tax law stipulates that the starting point for the temporary commercial tax is twenty yuan of operating funds. The representatives said that the current cooperatives have become collective operations, and this method of taxation restricts the economic development of the cooperatives and strikes a blow to the current operation of local specialties in the mountain areas.

    山区人民的呼声
    新华社记者　扈庄
    参加最近河南省召开的山区工作会议的代表们，对当前山区工作提出了许多意见，这些意见反映了当前广大山区人民的迫切要求。
    代表们普遍要求改进对山区工作的领导，特别是根据山区特点和山区人民的特殊要求来进行领导。代表们说，抗日战争、解放战争的时期，党和政府领导山区人民度过了最艰难的日子，但是现在对山区工作放松了。代表们提出，许多地区的领导不深入调查研究，帮助解决最迫切的问题，而采用和领导平原地区一样的领导方式领导山区工作，待山区人民提出意见时，又不虚心考虑、研究，改进领导，却抱怨山区人民如今落后了，“不听话了”。如今年春季省内开展的农田水利运动，许多不适宜打井的地区也强迫打井，结果打成的井成为没水的废井。栾川县今春布置童子庄乡打井八十眼，乡干部说，都是山那里能打井呀？县里干部却说，社会主义高潮到来了还这样落后？结果全乡打了十眼井只有二眼有水。伊源乡的群众说：“打了八眼井，七眼作了废；打成的一眼，只浇二分地。”给山区人民造成极大的浪费。
    新乡专区今年制定农业技术规程没有考虑山区生产状况，提出切合山区耕作条件的要求，而是和平原地区一样要求山区。如棉花规定长到十三个果枝才能打顶，但山区老农反映，这里最多只能长八个果枝。领导生产的干部硬叫群众到十三个果枝时才打顶，群众说：长两年也长不到十三个果枝啊！登封县马玉川乡是个山区，到处是羊肠小道，坎坷不平，人力推的小车行走就很困难，但今年春季县供销社的干部却在这里向农业社销售马车，合作社的干部不要，却被批评为“社会主义觉悟不高”。代表们说，今年春季有许多山区的供销社大力推广双铧犁、马拉收割机、水车等大件农具，但是小件农具如桑杈、扫帚、锄、犁面等等却常常供应不上。供销社在西峡县标尺乡推广了七部双铧犁、两部水车，但这个乡最大的一块耕地只有一亩二分大，没有一个水井，形成浪费。
    在文化教育、卫生等方面，山区代表们也提出许多意见。如小学教育规定三十个学生才能成为一班，年龄超过十六岁的不能入学，山区生活很艰苦，教员待遇却很低等等。代表们说，山区地广人稀，只有几户或几十户的村子，村村相隔遥远，那能聚集三十多个小孩？而山区人民入学较晚，十六岁以后要求入学的很多，却又不让入学。
    文化落后、疾病折磨是当前山区人民感到最大的痛苦，他们迫切要求文教卫生工作者帮助他们摆脱这一状况。如山区识字人少，年节的对联就没人写，西峡县的伏牛山区群众贴的许多对联中，有的只划个圈圈，有的仅贴个没有写字的红纸。如今山区在实现合作化以后，许多合作社找不到会计、记工员。据内乡县黄龙乡调查，全乡四百五十四人中，仅有二人识字，栾川县山区的十一个乡中，有九个乡的合作社找不到会计，这就严重地影响了这些合作社的经营管理和发展。
    山区人民有许多地方病长期危害人民的健康和幸福。据调查，伏牛山区带有地方性的病症有瘿、梅毒、关节炎等十七种之多。许多病症都很普遍，如患瘿者即到处皆是，许多人家都是全家患病，严重的脖子比头还粗，说话行动都困难，无法劳动。山区代表们要求文教部门和卫生部门大力调派干部上山，进行调查研究，根据山区情况帮助山区人民提高文化，大力开展各种病症的防治工作，逐步地消灭各种带有历史性的病症。
    山区是有着极为丰富的资源的，有许多土特产都是当前国家建设中极需的物资，但是，过去经济工作者对于山区的扶植却极为不够。这一点，山区的代表们也提出许多意见。如南阳专区的蚕丝缺乏经济和技术部门的支持，现在的生产水平只达到战前最高水平的四分之一。栾川县有八大土特产，其中仅药材一项就有八十多种，但目前收购的只有四十多种。栾川为很有名的猴头产地，可是现在由于长期没人收购，群众已不再从事生产，在栾川城内也买不到这个珍味了。山区代表要求交通部门多修建通往山区的公路，以便使山区的土特产能运出来，也要求银行增加贷款扶持，生产部门帮助提高技术，收购部门能普遍进行土特产生产情况的调查，进行收购，全面地帮助山区发展生产。
    山区代表们对税务部门在实现了合作化以后仍沿用着以前的收税办法，有很大的意见。这种税法规定临时商业税以二十元的经营资金作为起征点。代表们说，当前的合作社成为了集体经营，这样征税的办法就限制了合作社经济的发展，打击了当前山区的土特产的经营。
