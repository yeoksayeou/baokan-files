Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 28th: A high-purity refined antimony (containing more than 99.99% antimony), which can be used as a raw material for semiconductors, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau. After a preliminary re-examination by the non-ferrous metal industry research department in early August, it was proven that the impurities contained in this refined antimony are less than one ten-thousandth, and the quality meets the standards for high-purity refined antimony.

　　In March of this year, after the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau accepted the task of trial-producing "four nines" refined antimony, the employees, based on scientific theory and experience in removing impurities from antimony, repeatedly conducted research, selected the best raw materials, and succeeded after more than six purification treatment experiments. Three batches of new products were trial-produced one after another in early May. Now, the bureau is further researching and designing to prepare for the formal production of this high-purity refined antimony in the future.

    做半导体的原料
    高纯度精锑提炼成功
    新华社长沙28日电　一种可以做半导体原料的高纯度精锑（含锑99.99％以上），最近在锡矿山矿务局试制成功。经有色金属工业研究部门在8月上旬的初步复验，证明这种精锑所含的杂质低于万分之一，质量合乎高纯度精锑的标准。
    今年3月间，锡矿山矿务局接受了试制“四个九”精锑任务以后，职工们根据科学理论和锑中除杂的经验，反复进行研究，选择最好的原料，经过六次以上的提纯处理试验才得到成功，并且在5月上旬就先后试制出三批新产品。现在，这个局正进一步研究、设计，为今后正式生产这种高纯度精锑做好准备工作。
