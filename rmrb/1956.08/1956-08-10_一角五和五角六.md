    One Jiao Five and Five Jiao Six
    At a time when all parts of the country are generally paying attention to improving the living welfare of employees, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has issued a strange regulation: cadres above the eleventh grade and family members of cadres who come to Luoyang with the approval of the leadership will only pay one jiao and five fen per person per month for water and electricity, and half price for rent; cadres below the eleventh grade and family members of cadres who come to Luoyang without the approval of the leadership will pay five jiao and six fen per person per month for water and electricity, and full price for rent. We believe that this regulation is very unreasonable, and we hope that the welfare department of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau will quickly correct it. (Shou Cen)

    一角五和五角六
    正当全国各地普遍重视改善职工生活福利的时候，建筑工程部洛阳工程局却颁发一项奇怪的规定：凡十一级以上的干部及经过领导批准而来洛阳的干部家属，每人每月水电费只交一角五分，房租半价；十一级以下及未经领导批准而来洛阳的干部家属每人每月交水电费五角六分，房租全价。我们认为这个规定很不合理，希望洛阳工程局福利部门赶快纠正。　（寿岑）
