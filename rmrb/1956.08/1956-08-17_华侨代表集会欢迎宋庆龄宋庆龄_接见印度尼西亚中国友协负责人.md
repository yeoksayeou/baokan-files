Some of these overseas Chinese representatives traveled for several days by ship, some by train, and some by plane from major cities in Java, as well as from remote towns in other Indonesian islands such as Medan, Makassar, Pontianak, and Manado, to come to Jakarta specifically for the occasion. They arrived in the hall of the Chinese Embassy several hours before the welcoming meeting to wait for Soong Ching Ling.

Among these representatives were elderly gentlemen and ladies in their eighties, who were the oldest members and party members of the Tongmenghui and the Kuomintang founded by Sun Yat-sen.

Soong Ching Ling addressed the representatives, reporting on the progress of the motherland's economic construction. She said that in addition to actively preparing to liberate Taiwan by war if necessary, the Chinese people are also striving to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means. She also said that the overseas Chinese here should establish a solid friendship with the Indonesian people and live together in harmony. The representatives responded to her speech with thunderous applause.

The Deputy Mayor of Jakarta, Danubroto, also spoke at the welcoming meeting.

He also believed that the Chinese and Indonesian people should live in harmony to realize the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

After the speech, the overseas Chinese representatives presented Soong Ching Ling with banners and gifts. Finally, the overseas Chinese representatives went to Soong Ching Ling one by one to pay their respects.

When Soong Ching Ling left the embassy, tens of thousands of people gathered on the road in front of the gate. Her car had to slowly pass through the crowd. When she appeared, the crowd erupted in enthusiastic cheers and applause.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 16th: Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling received Professor Prijono, Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, and other leaders of the association at the State Palace on the morning of August 15th.

Encouraged by the spirit of the Bandung Conference, the Indonesian people are willing to be friendly with the people of other countries and advance side by side with them towards lasting world peace.

He believes that Soong Ching Ling's visit, as well as the arrival of the Chinese Friendship Delegation headed by Dapuson and the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, will help promote mutual understanding and close friendship between the two peoples.

In her reply, Soong Ching Ling expressed her heartfelt gratitude to President Sukarno and the Indonesian government and people for inviting her to visit Indonesia.

We Chinese people sincerely hope that you will continue to make great progress in the construction of your country and in the cause of safeguarding world peace. We are very pleased with every progress and achievement you have made in the struggle against colonialism and in the various steps to prosper your country."

    接见印度尼西亚中国友协负责人
    新华社雅加达16日电　来自印度尼西亚各地的大约一千五百名华侨代表八月十五日下午在雅加达举行欢迎会，欢迎宋庆龄副委员长。
    这些华侨代表有的乘了几天的轮船、有的乘火车、有的乘飞机分别从爪哇的大城市以及像棉兰、望加锡、坤甸、万鸦老等印度尼西亚其他岛屿的遥远的城镇特地赶来雅加达。他们在欢迎会前几个钟头就来到中国大使馆的大厅中等候宋庆龄。
    这些代表当中有八十岁高龄的老先生和老太太，他们是孙中山创建的同盟会和国民党的最老的会员和党员。
    宋庆龄对代表们讲了话，报告了祖国经济建设方面的进展。她说，中国人民除了积极准备在必要时用战争方式解放台湾以外，还努力争取用和平方式解放台湾。她又说，这里的华侨应当同印度尼西亚人民建立巩固的友谊，友好地在一起生活。代表们用暴风雨般的掌声回答她的讲话。
    雅加达市副市长达努布罗托在欢迎会上也讲了话。他说，他曾经在中国亲眼看到了宋庆龄提到的中国经济建设的进步。他也认为，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民应当友好相处，以实现和平共处的精神。
    在讲话后，华侨代表向宋庆龄献锦旗和礼物。最后，华侨代表们一一走到宋庆龄的面前，向她致敬。
    当宋庆龄离开大使馆的时候，成千上万的人聚集在大门前的马路上。她的汽车不得不在人潮中慢慢通过。当她出现的时候，群众中发出热烈的欢呼声和掌声。
    新华社雅加达16日电　宋庆龄副委员长八月十五日上午在国家宫接见了印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席普里约诺教授和协会的其他负责人。
    普里约诺教授致欢迎辞说：印度尼西亚人民在知道宋庆龄到来的时候的欢欣鼓舞是无法形容的。印度尼西亚人民在万隆会议精神的鼓舞下，愿意同其他国家的人民友好，并且同他们并肩向世界持久和平前进。
    他说，他所领导的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会已经成为前进中的印度尼西亚人民队伍中的不可分割的一部分。这个协会一直在顺利地发展，同北京的中国—印度尼西亚友好协会保持着良好的合作。他相信，宋庆龄的访问，以及以达浦生为首的中国友好代表团和中国杂技团的来到，将有助于促进两国人民之间的相互了解和亲密友谊。
    宋庆龄在答辞中对苏加诺总统以及印度尼西亚政府和人民邀请她访问印度尼西亚表示衷心的感谢。
    宋庆龄说：“我带着我国人民的深厚敬意和美好的祝福来到你们的国家。我们中国人民真诚地希望，你们将在你们国家的建设中和维护世界和平的事业中继续取得巨大的进展。我们对于你们在反对殖民主义的斗争中和繁荣你们国家的各种步骤中所取得的每一进展和成就感到非常高兴。”
    她说，在过去的两年中，两国间的友好协会相继成立。由于它们的共同努力，两国人民之间的文化交流和友好活动一直在发展。她相信，互相间的友好访问和文化交流不仅将巩固两国的友谊，而且还将在争取亚洲和世界和平中起重要的作用。
