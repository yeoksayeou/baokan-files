European Travel Notes [23]
Zhao Feng

Tangible Affection

Many people, knowing that Chinese artists have visited many countries in Western Europe, often ask, "Which country's people welcomed you the most?" This is truly a difficult question to answer. Because the public in every country welcomed the Chinese artists with the same enthusiasm, only the ways they expressed it might be different. The French public cheered enthusiastically, the Dutch people applauded and stomped their feet, while the British public laughed loudly in the theater. ...

After we returned to China, many people asked again, "How exactly did the European public welcome you?" Then, let me tell you one or two stories:

In Paris, at a banquet, I took out a folding fan. A French friend accompanying me reminded me, "In Europe, only women use fans." Just as I was about to put the fan away, a French poet snatched it and said, "No! As long as you, the Chinese artist, hold a fan in public this summer, tomorrow, we European men will also have the right to use fans in public." Another French novelist concluded, "Due to the success of your performances, the people of Paris have admired you to such an extent that whatever you do will be considered right and proper."

A Chinese overseas who had been a waiter in a Dutch Chinese restaurant for twenty years insisted on inviting us to his place as guests, because, he said, "Since your performance, many times, guests have come to shake my hand and praise Chinese art. Even I have shared in your glory."

In London, after we got off the bus, we received some gifts—later we learned that these fruits were personally selected by the gift-givers at the market. Before we left, each actress also received a set of nylon material, with matching colored nylon thread. The gift-giver, who resolutely refused to give her name, was later found to be a female missionary who had just returned to England from China.

Through direct contact, people can understand each other. In France, some of the receptionists at the hotel where we stayed shed tears. In England, a stage worker said, "I have never seen a foreign troupe receive such a welcome in England. I have also never seen foreign artists who are so gentle and polite, who don't curse, don't drink, and don't quarrel." An Italian restaurant waiter said, "You have only stayed here for a few days, please forgive my rudeness when you first arrived. Because in the past, people described you too badly. But now, I just realized that you are good people, but unfortunately you are leaving again."

All these tangible affections between people will remain in our memories forever.

    欧游散记〔二十三〕
    赵沨
    可感的情谊
    许多人当知道中国的艺术家们访问了西欧的许多国家时，经常会问：“哪个国家的人民最欢迎你们？”这真是个难回答的问题。因为每个国家的公众都以同样的热情欢迎了中国艺术家，只是表现出来的方式可能不同而已。法国的公众热情欢呼，荷兰人民鼓掌顿足，而英国公众在剧场放声大笑。……
    我们回国后，又有许多人问：“到底欧洲公众怎样欢迎你们的？”那么，我且来说一两个故事：
    在巴黎，有一次宴会上，我拿出一把折扇来。同行的一位法国朋友提醒我说：“在欧洲，只有妇女才用扇子的。”我正想把扇子收起来，旁边的一位法国诗人抢着说：“不！只要你，中国的艺术家，今年夏天在公众场合拿了扇子，明天，我们欧洲男人也就有权力在公众场合用扇子了。”另一位法国小说家作了结论：“由于你们演出的成功，巴黎人民已经对你们崇拜到如此地步，那就是无论你们做什么都会被认为是对的，应该的。”
    一个在荷兰的中国餐馆当了二十年的招待员的华侨，坚持要请我们到他那里作客，因为，他说：“自从你们演出后，好多次，客人们走来向我握手，称赞中国的艺术。连我也分享了你们的光荣了。”
    在伦敦，我们下车后便收到一些礼物——后来知道，这些水果还是送礼的人亲自到市场选购的。我们临走时，每个女演员还收到一套尼龙料子，还附有配好颜色的尼龙线。这个坚决不愿说出名字的送礼者，后来才知道是一位刚从中国回英国去的女传教士。
    通过了直接的接触，人们是可以相互了解的。在法国，我们住的那个旅馆的招待员中有人掉了泪。在英国，一个舞台工人说：“我从来没有见过一个外国剧团在英国受到这样的欢迎。我也从来没有见过一些外国艺术家竟然如此温文有礼，不骂人，不喝酒，不吵架。”一个意大利的餐厅招待员说：“你们只在这里停留了几天，请原谅你们刚来时我对你们的无礼。因为，过去人们把你们形容得太坏了。而现在，我刚刚知道你们是好人，可惜你们又走了。”
    所有这些可感的人民之间的情谊，将永留在我们记忆里。
