    Public Communique Released by the Egyptian Commercial Representative Office in China on the Nationalization of the Suez Canal Company

    The Egyptian Republic’s Commercial Representative Office in China released a public communique on July 28 regarding the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company (an Egyptian joint-stock company).

    The communique stated that in his clear political speech on the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution, President Nasser recounted Egypt’s earnest efforts to safeguard its economic independence by realizing the Aswan High Dam project, as well as the obstacles created by Washington, London, and the World Bank, the final measure of which was their withdrawal of the proposal to finance the High Dam project. This situation prompted the Egyptian Republic to nationalize the Suez Canal Company.

    The measures for nationalization have been immediately implemented, thus restoring Egypt's historical rights, which will bring in $100 million annually and help build the High Dam without relying on foreign aid.

    The communique said that a law has been passed for this purpose, which took effect on the date of its promulgation, July 26, 1956.

    The full text of this law, attached to the communique, is as follows:

    Law No. 285 of 1956 of the Egyptian Republic Concerning the Nationalization of the International Suez Canal Company

    Article 1: The International Suez Canal Company is nationalized. All assets, rights, and obligations of the company will be transferred to the state. All institutions and leadership committees currently responsible for managing the company will be dissolved. Compensation to shareholders and founders of stock owners will be calculated based on the closing price on the Paris Stock Exchange on the day before this law takes effect. The aforementioned compensation issue will be resolved after all assets of the nationalized company are transferred to the state.

    Article 2: The management of shipping in the Suez Canal will be entrusted to an independent institution with legal person status, subordinate to the Ministry of Commerce. The President of the Republic will issue orders stipulating the composition of this institution and the salaries of its members. To manage this public utility, this institution will possess all necessary powers and will not be restricted by government regulations and measures. Without prejudice to the Auditing Bureau's supervision of the final accounts, this institution will have an independent budget, which will be formulated according to the rules followed by commercial enterprises. The budget year will run from July 1st of each year to June 30th of the following year. This institution's budget and final accounts will be approved by order of the President of the Republic. The first budget year will run from the date this law takes effect to June 30, 1957. This institution will have the right to designate one or more of its members to execute decisions and complete the tasks entrusted to the institution. In addition, this institution has the right to establish several technical committees with its members or other individuals to conduct research and investigation work. The chairman of this institution will represent it in relations with the government's judicial and other departments, as well as with third parties.

    Article 3: The assets of the nationalized company in the Egyptian Republic and abroad will be frozen. Without a decision by the institution stipulated in Article 2, no bank, organization, or individual may handle the assets of this institution by any means, pay any funds, or handle any claims or debts.

    Article 4: The institution will retain all employees of the nationalized company, and all employees shall continue to perform their duties. Without the prior permission of the institution stipulated in Article 2, the aforementioned personnel may not leave their posts for any reason or cause.

    Article 5: Violations of the provisions of Article 3 will be punished by imprisonment and a fine equal to three times the value of the object involved in the violation.
