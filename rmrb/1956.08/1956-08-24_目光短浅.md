    Shortsightedness
    Shi Liuming
    A worker from a factory in Shenyang wrote a letter saying that they have a large number of maintenance workers piled up. When other factories want to transfer them, they say, "We don't need them today, but we will tomorrow," and refuse to transfer them. When other factories want to borrow them, they worry, "What if they don't return them?" and refuse to lend them. The maintenance workers have no regular work to do and spend their days doing odd jobs, causing their morale to fluctuate. The factory director then held a general meeting to mobilize them: "Regardless of whether you are doing carpentry or metalwork now, the country needs it. The leadership will never look down on you because you are not skilled or do less work. Your wages will be paid as usual. Put your minds at ease and listen to the organization's assignments!"
    Selfish departmentalists are usually described as shortsighted people, and this is indeed true. Moreover, selfish departmentalists not only have shortsightedness themselves but also assume that others are shortsighted. Precisely because of this, they feel that although selfish departmentalism is not good, it will ultimately succeed. Look at how this factory director regards the workers! In his view, as long as they are "not looked down upon" spiritually and "paid as usual" materially, even if they have no regular work to do, they will "put their minds at ease and listen to the organization's assignments," and submit to the interests of selfish departmentalism.
    However, what our workers care most about is contributing their strength to the country's socialist construction. Whether they are "not looked down upon" or "paid as usual," they are unwilling to be without work and will write letters to higher authorities and newspapers.
    This is why selfish departmentalism often runs into snags.

    目光短浅
    石六鸣
    沈阳一个工厂的工人来信说，他们那里积压了大批机修工。别的厂想调，他们说“今天用不上，明天总要用”，不调；别的厂想借，他们担心“借了不还，怎么办”，不借。机修工没有正活干，整天打杂，情绪波动。厂长就开了大会作动员：“不管你们现在做木工活，还是做铁工活，都是国家需要的，领导上决不因为你们不熟练，干得少，就看轻你们，工资也是原薪照发，你们安下心来听从组织分配吧！”
    通常都把本位主义者形容成目光短浅的人，这话确实不错；而且本位主义者不仅自己目光短浅，还推己及人，在他们看来，别人也是目光短浅的。正因为如此，他们才觉得本位主义虽然不好，终究是能得逞的。看这位厂长同志把工人看成什么样的人了！在他看来，精神上既是“并不看轻”，物资上又是“原薪照发”，虽然没有正活干，“安下心来听从组织分配”，服从本位主义的利益，总是没有问题的了。
    然而，我们的工人最关心的是把自己的力量贡献给国家的社会主义建设，“并不看轻”也好，“原薪照发”也好，没有工作做，就是一千个不愿意，就要给上级写信，给报纸写稿。
    这就是本位主义常常要碰壁的原因。
