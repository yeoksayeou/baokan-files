Behind the "Foreign Stereotypes" of the U.S. State Department
Jiang Yuanchun

The closer the opening day of the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly, the more flustered the gentlemen at the U.S. State Department become. The prospect that the United States' attempt to continue obstructing China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations might fail in this General Assembly is like a nightmare pressing on their hearts, making them restless.

If the United States wants to continue keeping China outside the doors of the United Nations, it must find a way to obtain a two-thirds majority vote in the United Nations General Assembly. However, the United States is already very unsure whether it can garner this majority this year. The British magazine "Foreign Report" reported on August 2 that after Egypt and Syria recognized China, someone in Washington made an estimate of the possible voting situation. The result was that among the seventy-six member states, twenty-three would definitely support the restoration of China's legitimate seat, and six Asian-African countries might support it. This already exceeds one-third of the total votes.

For those in the United States who are resolutely hostile to the Chinese people, the situation is very urgent. Therefore, the anti-China movement, like a periodic fit of hysteria, which is carried out once a year, is on a larger scale this year. The United States wants to use this propaganda campaign to exert pressure on other countries and force them to continue to act according to the intentions of the United States. The United States is taking every opportunity to slander the Chinese people, and the U.S. Congress is also making many pretentious gestures, adding clauses to the U.S. State Department's appropriations bill and the U.S. foreign aid bill that prohibit the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations. The United States also appointed "Taiwan Senator" Nolan as a member of the U.S. delegation to this United Nations General Assembly, to make clear the ambition of the United States.

At the same time, officials from the U.S. State Department have also come out to deliver advertisement-style speeches, repeatedly publicizing that the U.S. attitude towards China remains unchanged. The most recent people to give such speeches include Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson and Robert Hill.

If judged according to the advertising skills of the United States, which is famous for its innovative tricks, then these senior officials of the State Department are really clumsy advertising merchants. Their speeches are obviously drafted according to the same propaganda outline, thus creating a "foreign stereotype" unique to the U.S. State Department.

This long and tedious "foreign stereotype" usually begins by proclaiming the United States' desire for peace, thinking that this will make people feel how justified the ensuing curse of the communists is. Then the "foreign stereotype" turns to attacking the Chinese people. The basic points of attack are always these three: Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan, and they almost never make the mistake of messing up the order. On these issues, the authors of the "foreign stereotype" seem to never read the newspapers, know nothing about world public opinion, and therefore just repeat those bankrupt clichés with their eyes closed. After reveling in these clichés, the U.S. State Department's "foreign stereotype" concludes that the issue of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations should not be resolved until the problems of Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan are resolved. Thus, the "foreign stereotype" is successfully completed.

Although the U.S. State Department's "foreign stereotype" does not arouse people's interest, it can be seen from behind it what the United States' plans are in the Far East.

The United States is willing to change its attitude towards China only after the problems of Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan are resolved. But who is hindering the resolution of these problems? In Korea, isn't it the United States that is sabotaging the armistice agreement, wanting to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, wanting to import new weapons, and strengthening the army of Syngman Rhee? At the Geneva Conference, isn't it the United States that refused to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and used a plan for a UN-supervised election that was known to be unacceptable to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea? In Vietnam, isn't it precisely the Ngo Dinh Diem clique supported by the United States that is refusing to hold the nationwide free elections stipulated in the Geneva Accords? In Taiwan, isn't it precisely the armed forces of the United States that have occupied Taiwan? And in the Sino-American talks in Geneva, isn't it the same United States that refuses to honestly issue a statement with China that no force will be used in the relations between the two countries?

The purpose of the United States is to prevent these problems in the Far East from being resolved for a long time, so as to provide an excuse for the anti-China movement. And the reason why it refuses to change its attitude towards China is precisely to prevent these problems from being resolved. In short, the United States wants to be hostile to the Chinese people and also wants the major problems in the Far East to exist forever. Robertson made the intentions of the United States very clear in his speech. He said that the "sole goal" of U.S. policy is to realize a so-called "world of free nations" without China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries. In other words, the United States is maintaining three fronts in the Far East, Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan, for the purpose of ultimately subverting China.

The United States is now waiting for this day to come. According to Robertson, time is on the side of the United States. This sentence is obviously Robertson cheering himself up. If time is really on the side of the United States, why would this Assistant Secretary of State put aside his pile of difficult diplomatic affairs and vociferously read out the "foreign stereotype" that does not allow China to restore its seat in the United Nations?

Robertson and his ilk can wait as long as they like, maybe they will still be waiting on some high mountain in the United States facing the west of the Pacific after they become fossils, but the day he is waiting for will never come. The U.S. State Department's "foreign stereotype" is precisely proof that American diplomacy has exhausted its tricks.

    在美国国务院的“洋八股”背后
    蒋元椿
    第十一届联合国大会开幕的日子越近，美国国务院的先生们就越觉得心慌意乱。美国继续阻挠中国恢复它在联合国的合法地位的企图，在这一届联合国大会中可能失败，这个念头像梦魇似地压在他们的心头，简直使得他们坐卧不安。
    美国要把中国继续关在联合国的大门之外，就得想办法在联合国大会上得到三分之二的多数票。可是美国对于今年是否能拉到这个多数，已经是十分没有把握。八月二日的英国“外事报道”杂志曾经报道说，在埃及、叙利亚承认中国以后，华盛顿有人对可能投票的情形作了一番估计，结果是在七十六个会员国中，肯定将赞成恢复中国的合法席位的有二十三国，可能赞成的有六个亚非国家。这就已经超过了总票数的三分之一。
    对于美国那些坚决敌视中国人民的人来说，情势是十分紧迫的了。因此，像定期发作的歇斯底里病一样每年搞一次的反对中国进入联合国的运动，今年就有了更大的规模。美国想通过这个宣传运动对其他国家施加压力，强迫它们继续按照美国的意图行事。美国利用一切机会对中国人民进行诬蔑，美国国会也装腔作势地作了许多姿态，在美国国务院的拨款法和美国援外法案上，都加上了不许恢复中国在联合国的席位的条款。美国还指派了“台湾参议员”诺兰作为美国出席本届联合国大会的代表团的团员，以明美国之志。
    同时，美国国务院的官员们也纷纷出来发表广告式的演说，反复宣传美国对中国的态度不变。最近出来发表这种演说的就有国务院的助理国务卿华尔特·罗伯逊和罗伯特·希尔。
    如果按照以善于花样翻新出名的美国的广告术来衡量，那末这些国务院的高级官员实在是蹩脚得很的广告商人。他们的演说显然是按照同一个宣传提纲拟就的，因此他们创造了一种美国国务院独有的“洋八股。”
    这种又臭又长的“洋八股”照例总是从宣扬美国的和平愿望开头，以为这样就能使人们觉得紧跟着来的对共产党人的咒骂是多么有理。接着“洋八股”就转入对中国人民的攻击。基本攻击点永远是这三个：朝鲜、越南、台湾，而且几乎从来不犯弄乱先后次序的错误。在这几个问题上，“洋八股”的作者似乎是从来不看报的，对于世界舆论一无所知，因此只是闭着眼睛反复重述那些早已破了产的陈腔滥调。在用这些滥调自我陶醉一番以后，美国国务院的“洋八股”就作出结论说，在朝鲜、越南、台湾这些问题没有解决以前，中国在联合国的合法席位问题就不应该解决。于是，“洋八股”大功告成。
    美国国务院的“洋八股”虽然引不起人们的兴趣，可是从它背后却可以看出美国在远东究竟有些什么打算。
    美国要在朝鲜、越南、台湾这几个问题解决以后，才肯改变它对中国的态度。可是，究竟是谁在阻挠这些问题的解决呢？在朝鲜，破坏停战协定，要取消中立国监察委员会，要运入新式武器、加强李承晚军队的，难道不是美国？在日内瓦会议上拒绝从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，用明知不会被接受的联合国监督选举的方案来阻挠朝鲜的和平统一的，难道不是美国？在越南，难道不正是美国支持的吴庭艳集团拒绝进行日内瓦协议所规定的全国自由普选？在台湾，难道不正是美国的武装力量侵占了台湾？而在日内瓦的中美会谈中，不肯老老实实地同中国发表在两国关系中不使用武力的声明的，难道不就是同一个美国？
    美国的目的就是要让远东的这些问题长期不得解决，好使敌视中国的运动得到借口。而它之所以不肯改变对中国的态度，也正是为了使这些问题不能得到解决。总而言之，美国既要敌视中国人民，也要使远东的重大问题永远存在。罗伯逊在他的演说里把美国的意图讲得很清楚。他说，美国政策的“唯一目标”，就是实现一个没有中国、苏联和其他人民民主国家的所谓“自由国家的世界”。换句话说，美国在远东保持朝鲜、越南、台湾三条战线，就是为了最后颠覆中国。
    美国现在就在等着这一天的到来。据罗伯逊说，时间是有利于美国的。这句话，显然是罗伯逊拿来给自己打气的。如果时间真的对美国有利的话，这位助理国务卿又何必放下他那一摊辣手的外交事务不管，却来声嘶力竭地宣读不许恢复中国在联合国席位的“洋八股”呢？
    罗伯逊之流可以尽管等着，也许等他们成了化石以后还在美国的某座高山上向着太平洋的西面等着，可是他所等待的那一天却是永远也不会到来的了。美国国务院的“洋八股”，正是美国外交黔驴技穷的证明。
