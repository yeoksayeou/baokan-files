    一批防汛积极分子参加共产党和青年团
    据新华社哈尔滨19日电　哈尔滨市党、团组织最近接收一批在防汛中经过考验的积极分子入党入团。据中共哈尔滨市直属机关委员会等二十个单位统计，在防汛中被接收入党的已经有一百五十多人，入团的有一百二十多人。
    新接收的党、团员过去都是工作积极、思想进步，迫切要求入党入团的人。在这次防汛工作中又表现积极努力，有较好的成绩。如中共哈尔滨市财政局总支委员会新接收的党员田志超，过去在机关工作中一贯表现很好，在这次防汛中，他担任运土工作很积极，受到群众的赞扬。新接收入党的市直属机关文化学校张桂媛，她白天和男同志一样积极扛土、挖土，晚间还主动搞黑板报，鼓舞防汛战士的工作情绪。
