Xinhua News Agency, Suzhou, August 24th: Leadership personnel from various factories in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, are universally summarizing and exchanging experiences in leading the advanced producers movement. This is being done to improve leadership skills and address the current situation where leadership lags behind the masses as the advanced producers movement deepens.

Recently, the leadership personnel of the Chinese Communist Party organizations, administrative bodies, and trade unions in Suzhou's factories have separately held city-wide and industry-specific experience exchange meetings. They exchanged experiences on strengthening production management in the advanced producers movement, mobilizing the masses to learn advanced experiences targeting key production issues, strengthening collective leadership to ensure the healthy development of the movement, and caring for workers in terms of technology, political thought, and livelihood during the movement. In the silk industry, leaders from the joint state-private venture Zhenya Silk Factory introduced their experience in strengthening production management during the movement. After learning from the example of the Zhenya Silk Factory's director and office staff who regularly went to the workshops to inspect production, the joint state-private venture Dongwu, Guangming and other silk factories also strengthened production management. Leaders from Guangming Silk Factory conducted in-depth investigations and research, identifying key problems such as the high rate of defective products in main products like crepe satin and soft satin. They purposefully discovered, summarized, and promoted advanced experiences targeting these problems, improving product quality. This experience has also been valued by many factories.

Through the summary and exchange of experiences by factory leaders, the enthusiasm of the leaders has been promoted, and they have been specifically helped to improve their leadership skills. Through the exchange of experiences, a good atmosphere of mutual learning and mutual assistance has been formed between factories.
