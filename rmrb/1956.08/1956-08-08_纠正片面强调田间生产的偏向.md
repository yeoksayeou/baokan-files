Xinhua News Agency report: Heilongjiang Province has recently begun to correct the tendency of agricultural production cooperatives to unilaterally emphasize women's participation in field production while neglecting women's handling of household chores and participation in sideline production.

Encouraged by the principle of remuneration according to labor in advanced agricultural production cooperatives, the number of women participating in agricultural production in Heilongjiang Province this year has increased unprecedentedly. According to surveys, approximately 80% or more of the female labor force participated in field production during the summer hoeing season.

However, during the high tide of women's participation in agricultural production, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have generally experienced situations where they did not take into account women's physiological characteristics and physical strength, particularly neglecting the labor that women should be engaged in for handling household chores and developing family sideline production, unilaterally demanding that more and more women participate in field production, and assigning them heavy labor that they were unable to handle. Moreover, in some places, regardless of the old, young, pregnant women, and women with chronic diseases, all were mobilized to go to the fields to work. In terms of working hours, women were required to do the same amount of work as male members, otherwise they would not be given equal pay for equal work, so that women worked as hard as men during the day, and had to take care of children, cook, and handle other household chores when they returned home in the evening, which seriously damaged the health of some women, affected the due care of their children, and hindered the development of family sideline production.

The emergence of these problems is mainly due to the lack of correct understanding and comprehensive arrangement of women's labor by many rural cadres, ignoring the special difficulties of women, and distorting the meaning of equality between men and women in economic terms and equal pay for equal work. Secondly, some cadres doing women's work and the women themselves have the idea of "striving to be advanced," mistakenly believing that not working in the fields is "backward." As a result, the health of some women was harmed, their enthusiasm was frustrated, and a very bad influence was created in society.

After this bias emerged, not only did it fail to attract the attention of the leading organs in various regions to stop it in time, but on the contrary, some county and township cadres inappropriately praised and promoted it, fueling the development of this bias. In some places, bad habits such as resentment towards having many children and discrimination against housework have emerged.

Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation specifically convened a meeting to discuss correcting the above-mentioned bias and comprehensively arranging women's labor in agricultural production cooperatives.

### 纠正片面强调田间生产的偏向

    农业社要全面安排妇女劳动
    纠正片面强调田间生产的偏向
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省最近已开始纠正农业生产合作社片面强调妇女参加田间生产，忽视妇女处理家务和参加副业生产的偏向。
    在高级农业生产合作社实行按劳取酬原则的鼓舞下，黑龙江省今年参加农业生产的妇女空前增多。据调查，夏锄期间约有80％以上的妇女劳动力参加了田间生产。
    但是在妇女参加农业生产的高潮中，各地农业生产合作社较普遍地发生了不照顾妇女的生理特点和体力的情况，特别是忽视了妇女在处理家务和发展家庭副业生产方面所应当从事的劳动，片面地要求参加田间生产的妇女越多越好，并让她们担任一些力不胜任的繁重劳动，而且有些地方不分老、少、孕妇和有慢性疾病的妇女，一齐动员下地生产。在劳动时间上，要求妇女的劳动量和男社员一样，不然就不给同工同酬，使妇女白天和男人一样的干活，晚上回来还得带孩子、做饭和处理其他家务，以至严重地损害了一些妇女的健康，影响了对儿女应有的照顾，妨碍了家庭副业生产的发展。
    这些问题的产生，主要是许多农村干部对妇女的劳动缺乏正确的认识和全面安排，忽视妇女的特殊困难，并且曲解男女在经济上的平等和同工同酬的含意。其次某些做妇女工作的干部和妇女本身存在着“争先进”的思想，错误地认为不下地干活就是“落后”。这样做的结果，损害了一些妇女的健康，挫折了她们的积极性，并在社会上造成了很不好的影响。
    这种偏向产生以后，不仅没有引起各地领导机关的注意，及时予以制止，相反有些县、乡干部还不恰当地加以表扬、提倡，助长了这种偏向的发展。有些地方并出现了怨恨孩子多、歧视家务劳动等不良风气。
    最近黑龙江省民主妇女联合会专门召开了会议，讨论纠正上述偏向，全面安排农业生产合作社中妇女劳动的问题。
