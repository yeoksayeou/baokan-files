Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 9th: The U.S. Information Service released on the 7th a letter from U.S. President Eisenhower to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, in response to Bulganin's letter of June 6th to Eisenhower regarding the disarmament issue.

In his letter, Eisenhower did not indicate any willingness on the part of the United States to make any serious effort to promote a resolution to the disarmament issue. He stated that he welcomed the Soviet Union's disarmament decisions, but also said that, with the exception of the Korean War period, the United States had also been reducing its own armed forces since the end of World War II. He believed that the Soviet Union's reduction of armed forces, like that of the United States, was for "its own national interests." He doubted whether this would make an effective contribution to eliminating the fear and enormous costs generated by the arms race among nations.

He then reiterated the demand for acceptance of the U.S.'s proposed so-called "open skies" plan.

Eisenhower also expressed unwillingness to consider the issue of reducing troops stationed in West Germany, saying that the issue of German troops could not be treated as an "isolated problem." He reiterated the proposal to restore German unification through "free elections" and insisted that the Soviet government intentionally "maintain the division of Germany indefinitely."

Eisenhower emphasized the issue of disarmament supervision, saying that he still hoped to make progress toward meaningful arms supervision.

He added: "My colleagues and I have always been studying the entire issue of arms limitation with the utmost seriousness. First and foremost, there is the issue of eliminating the increasing threat of nuclear weapons and new means of delivery. If new possibilities for international action arise as a result of this research (and I believe they will), then I will notify you, either directly or through the appropriate agencies of the United Nations." He also expressed disagreement with Bulganin's views on the activities of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee.

Eisenhower finally requested that the Soviet Union, in a "new spirit," "correct" the so-called "maladies" manifested at home and abroad.

### 艾森豪威尔复信给布尔加宁  力图推卸美国阻挠解决裁军问题的责任

    艾森豪威尔复信给布尔加宁
    力图推卸美国阻挠解决裁军问题的责任
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国新闻处七日公布了美国总统艾森豪威尔给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的一封信，这封信是答复布尔加宁六月六日就裁军问题写给艾森豪威尔的信的。
    艾森豪威尔在他的信里没有表示美国愿意为促进解决裁军问题作任何认真的努力。他说，他对苏联的裁军决定是欢迎的，但是他又说，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，除了朝鲜战争期间外，美国也在裁减自己的武装部队。他认为苏联的裁减武装部队和美国一样都是为了“自己国家的利益”。他怀疑这究竟会不会作出有效的贡献而有助于消除各国扩军所产生的恐惧和庞大的费用。
    他接着重申要求接受美国提出的所谓空中视察计划。
    艾森豪威尔还表示不愿意考虑裁减驻西德武装部队的问题，他说，在德国驻军问题不能当作“孤立的问题”来处理。他重申通过“自由选举”来恢复德国统一的主张，并且硬说苏联政府有意“无限期维持德国的分裂局面”。
    艾森豪威尔着重提出裁军的监督问题，他说，他仍然希望在走向有意义的军备监督方面能够取得进展。
    他又说：“我和我的同事们始终在极其认真地研究整个限制军备问题。首先是关于消除核子武器和新的投掷工具的日益严重的威胁的问题。如果由于这种研究而发生了采取国际行动的新的可能性（我相信是这样的），那末我将要通知你，或是直接通知，或是通过联合国的适当机构通知。”他还表示不同意布尔加宁对于联合国裁军小组委员会的活动的看法。
    艾森豪威尔最后要求苏联以“新的精神”来“纠正”在国内外表现出来的所谓“弊病”。（附图片）
