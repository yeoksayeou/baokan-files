    Reorganize the Cooperation Network
    Before Yutian County, Hebei Province, achieved advanced collectivization, each township had a cooperation network. At that time, the cooperation network played a significant role in consolidating and improving cooperatives and enhancing the ability of grassroots cadres to manage cooperatives. After most townships formed an advanced cooperative as a unit, the township-based cooperation network was naturally abolished. For more than half a year, the 118 agricultural production cooperatives in this county have not had a new form to strengthen ties. I suggest restoring the organization of the cooperation network. Of course, the restored cooperation network should no longer be based on townships, but can be composed of several cooperatives based on natural conditions, the foundation of old and new cooperatives, etc. This will definitely be beneficial to continuing to improve and consolidate cooperatives.

    把合作网重新组织起来
    河北省玉田县在实现高级合作化以前，各乡都有合作网。合作网在当时对巩固提高合作社、提高基层干部办社能力都起了很大的作用。多数乡以乡为单位组成了一个高级合作社以后，以乡为单位的合作网就自然取消了。半年多来，这个县118个农业生产合作社还没有一种新的形式来加强联系。我建议恢复合作网的组织。当然，恢复的合作网不能再以乡为单位，可以根据自然条件、新老社基础等，由几个合作社组成一个合作网，这对继续提高巩固合作社一定会有好处。
