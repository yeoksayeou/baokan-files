Douhe Reservoir Project Basically Completed

    The Douhe Reservoir is one of the key water conservancy projects in Hebei Province and was basically completed on July 17. The dam of this reservoir is eight *huali* long and is currently the longest earth dam in our country. The water diversion tunnel is 120 meters long, and the reservoir can store more than 200 million cubic meters of floodwater. After the completion of the Douhe Reservoir, it will permanently eliminate the threat of Douhe floods to Tangshan City, solve the industrial water needs of Tangshan City, and ensure the safe passage of the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway during the flood season and the safety of farmland on both sides of the Douhe River.

    陡河水库工程基本完成
    陡河水库是河北省的重点水利工程之一，已在7月17日基本建成。这座水库的拦河坝长八华里，是我国目前最长的一条土坝，输水隧洞长一百二十公尺，水库能蓄洪二亿公方以上。陡河水库建成后，将永远消除陡河洪水对唐山市的威胁，解决了唐山市工业用水的需要，并可保证京山铁路在汛期安全通车和陡河两岸农田的安全。这是陡河水库的一角。　王佑生摄（新华社稿）
