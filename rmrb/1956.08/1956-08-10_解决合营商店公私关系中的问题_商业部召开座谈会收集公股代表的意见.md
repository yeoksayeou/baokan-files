Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: The Ministry of Commerce convened a symposium for public representatives of jointly-operated public-private stores from July 17th to 31st, aiming to gather their opinions and address the issues they encounter in handling public-private relations. Through this symposium, the participating public representatives felt that the nature of private enterprises had fundamentally changed after the implementation of public-private partnerships and fixed interest rates, and private personnel had become public employees of the enterprise. They also clarified their understanding of the role of private personnel in business operations, changed their mood of unease about serving as public representatives, and exchanged experiences in working with private personnel.

The representatives discussed the role of private personnel in business operations. They generally agreed that private personnel have certain strengths in business operations. They usually have the ability to identify goods and know their properties and uses. They are familiar with the production and sales of goods, can pay attention to market changes, and quickly adapt to the needs of the people. They have certain experiences and methods in the storage and warehousing of goods. They have rich experience in business management. They have the ability and methods to be economical in expense spending. Some private personnel also have higher levels of skill. The representatives also recognized that private personnel have many shortcomings. Due to their class background, private personnel still have more individualism. In business operations, they often have capitalist business ideas and are accustomed to capitalist business methods. A small number of them have poorer working abilities because they did not directly participate in business operations in the past. The representatives believed that their strengths should be praised and encouraged, and that we should learn from them. Their shortcomings should be appropriately criticized and educated to help them correct them. The skills and experience of private personnel should be regarded as a valuable asset.

The representatives discussed why some public-private joint ventures had failed to ensure that private personnel had both positions and power. They believed that this was due to several reasons: public representatives did not have enough trust, support, and help for private personnel; the views of employees on private personnel, especially capitalists, cannot be completely changed at present; the private personnel themselves have certain shortcomings; higher-level authorities and enterprises mostly focus on public representatives, regardless of the size of the matter; higher-level enterprise departments, banks, taxation and other relevant departments, and public opinion have insufficient understanding of the changes in the status and role of capitalist personnel. In addition, the division of powers between the public and private sides working together in the enterprise is not clear enough, and there is a lack of a set of systems and methods for working together, which is also an important reason.

Regarding the current issues of authority in joint ventures, the representatives believed that it should first be clarified the relationship between the public-private joint venture and the competent specialized company, stipulate certain powers for the public-private joint venture in handling its own work issues, and then, on this basis, the leaders of both the public and private sides should have a clear division of labor. The symposium also discussed the scope of meetings that private personnel should attend and the scope of documents they should read. The representatives believed that all employees on the public and private sides should have positions, powers, and responsibilities, and jointly abide by the articles of association and systems of the joint venture.

The representatives believed that in a joint venture, the public representatives, employees, and private personnel have different perspectives and opinions on each issue because of their different positions. However, as long as these different opinions are under the unified leadership of the enterprise's Party organization, and after repeated democratic discussions and full absorption of correct opinions from all parties, they can achieve consistency. The symposium studied the difficulties in the work of public representatives, especially how public representatives can carry out their work under the collective leadership of the enterprise's Party organization, and discussed the relationship between the enterprise's administrative side and the trade union. The symposium also studied ways to actively assist private personnel to strengthen unity and mutual assistance, eliminate prejudices, and jointly improve the business management of the store, in response to the phenomenon that there is not enough unity among private personnel in many public-private joint ventures. For the relationship between employees and private personnel in some enterprises, the public personnel should also strengthen education for both sides and improve this relationship through various appropriate forms and methods.

The representatives also exchanged views on what constitutes socialist business ideas and business methods. They believed that socialist commerce should serve the people, obey the state plan, correctly handle the relationship between the state and the enterprise, be under collective leadership and also accept mass supervision, constantly reduce commodity circulation costs to ensure the necessary accumulation of state construction funds, and resolutely not allow the use of short measures, cheating, or speculative means to obtain profits. Socialist commerce should be an enterprise that inherits all the excellent historical traditions of our country's commerce. The representatives believed that all public-private joint ventures should engage in business management using socialist business methods.

The representatives criticized some leading organizations and leaders, accusing them of criticizing and blaming public representatives more often than providing specific help; not caring about the work of public representatives; not going deep into the lower levels to understand and research, and having bureaucratic and commandist work styles. They hoped that these leading organizations and leaders would improve their leadership work, and hoped that leading organizations at all levels would actively support and help public representatives.

The symposium was attended by twenty-five public representatives from public-private joint commercial enterprises in fourteen cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Nanjing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Changsha, Xuzhou, Hangzhou, Tongzhou, and Xiaoshan County.

    解决合营商店公私关系中的问题
    商业部召开座谈会收集公股代表的意见
    据新华社9日讯　商业部为了收集公私合营商店中公股代表的意见，解决他们在处理公私关系中所遇到的问题，在七月十七日到三十一日召开了一次公私合营商店公股代表座谈会。经过这次座谈，参加会议的公股代表认为私营企业实行公私合营和定息以后，企业性质发生了根本的变化，私方人员成为企业的公职人员；明确地认识到私方人员在业务经营上的作用，改变了不安心做公股代表工作的情绪，还交流了同私方人员共事的经验。
    代表们讨论了商业企业私方人员在业务经营上的作用问题。大家认为私方人员在业务经营上有一定的长处，他们一般有鉴别商品的能力，知道商品的性质和用途；熟悉商品的产销情况，能注意市场的变化，迅速适应人民的需要；对商品的保管、仓储方面有一定的经验和办法；在经营管理方面有丰富的经验；在费用开支上有精打细算的能力和办法；有些私方人员还有较高的技术。代表们也认识到私方人员还有不少缺点。由于阶级出身的关系，私方人员还存在着较多的个人主义思想，在业务经营上往往存在着资本主义经营思想，习惯于资本主义的经营方法，其中有很少数人，由于过去没有直接参加业务经营，工作能力较差。代表们认为，对他们的长处要表扬鼓励，要向他们学习；对他们的短处要适当地进行批评教育，帮助他们改正。对待私方人员的技术和经验，应当看作一项宝贵的财富。
    代表们在讨论为什么有些公私合营商店中没有能够作到私方人员有职有权的时候，认为这有多方面的原因。这就是公股代表对私方人员的信任、支持和帮助不够；职工对私方人员特别是资本家的看法目前还不可能完全转变；私方人员本身存在着一定的缺点；上级机关、企业不论大小事情多半抓公方代表；上级企业部门、银行、税务等有关部门和社会舆论对资方人员的地位和作用的变化认识不足。此外，公私双方在企业里共事的职权范围划分不够明确，缺乏一套共事的制度和办法，也是一个重要原因。
    对于合营商店中现行的职权方面的问题，代表们认为，首先应当明确公私合营企业与主管专业公司的关系，规定公私合营企业在处理本身工作问题上的一定的权限，然后在这个基础上，公私双方领导人员都应当有明确的分工。座谈会也讨论了私方人员应当参加会议和应当阅读文件的范围问题。代表们认为，公私双方从业人员都应当有职、有权、有责，共同遵守合营商店的章则和制度。
    代表们认为，合营商店里公股代表、职工和私方人员三个方面因为所处的地位不同，对每个问题的看法和意见不一定相同。但是这些不同的意见，只要在企业党组织的统一领导下，经过反复的民主讨论，充分吸收各方面的正确意见，是能够取得一致的。座谈会研究了公股代表工作上的困难，特别讨论了公股代表怎样在企业的党组织的集体领导下进行工作，讨论了企业行政方面同工会的关系。座谈会还针对目前有不少公私合营商店中私方人员相互之间团结不够的现象，研究了积极协助私方人员之间加强团结互助，消除成见，共同搞好商店的经营管理的办法。对于有些企业职工同私方人员间的关系，公方人员也应当对双方加强教育，通过各种适当形式和方法，改进这种关系。
    代表们还就什么是社会主义性质的商业的经营思想和经营方法交换了意见。他们认为，社会主义商业应当是为人民服务的，是服从国家计划、能正确处理国家和企业的关系的，是集体领导同时也接受群众监督的，是应当不断降低商品流通费用来保证国家建设资金必要的积累的，是坚决不容许用短尺缺斤、投机取巧办法取得利润的。社会主义商业应当是继承我国商业中一切优良的历史传统的企业。代表们认为所有公私合营商店都应当以社会主义的经营方法从事经营管理。
    代表们对某些领导机关和领导人员提出了批评，指责他们对公股代表批评，责难多，具体帮助少；没有关心公股代表的工作；没有深入下层了解、研究，有官僚主义和命令主义的作风，并且希望这些领导机关和领导人员改进领导工作，希望各级领导机关积极支持和帮助公股代表。
    参加这次座谈会的有来自上海、北京、天津、武汉、广州、沈阳、西安、南京、济南、太原、长沙、徐州、杭州、通州十四个城市和萧山县的公私合营商业企业的公股代表共二十五人。
