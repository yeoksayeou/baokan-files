    The Troubles of Factory Directors
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    This year has seen the most frequent changes in production plans for state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang. So far, some factories have experienced as many as eight changes, while others have had at least three; and some factories are still undergoing changes. The two most significant changes were: one at the beginning of the year during the anti-Rightist conservatism campaign, which mainly involved increases, and substantial increases at that, with the total output value generally increasing by 50% to 100% compared to last year; the other occurred around May, mainly involving reductions, with most factories having their annual targets cut by 10% to 25%, also a considerable reduction.

    The increases at the beginning of the year, in retrospect, were largely justified and reasonable. The progress in fulfilling the plans in the first half of the year was generally good, with most factories completing or exceeding their main targets. The overall trend in product quality was also upward. There were no problems with product sales, with most products being in high demand. Even so, the factories' production capacity has not been fully utilized. The equipment utilization rate at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory was only 66%, and other factories were around 60%. Currently, the only threats to factory production are tight supplies of materials and collaborative products. The main reasons for the shortages are insufficient material sources; in addition, too many plan changes and insufficient time for preparation have exacerbated the situation. If there was a tendency towards rash advances, it mainly lay in the underestimation of these factors.

    The reductions in May were caused by the tight supplies of materials and collaborative products. Without materials, production is naturally impossible, and it is necessary to appropriately reduce the plans. At the same time, moderately easing the tasks of factories with relatively tight targets is also beneficial for better accommodating new product trial production and making necessary preparations for next year's production.

    However, some problems have arisen during the latest round of plan changes.

    Recently, in conversations with some factory directors, they generally had few complaints about the increased targets at the beginning of the year. What they deeply regretted were the recent large-scale reductions in plans. There weren't many complaints about the plan reductions that were reasonable. What factory directors are most dissatisfied with is that some factories could have avoided or reduced the scale of the cuts, but the responsible industrial ministries and administrations insisted on drastically reducing their plans with a single command, or arbitrarily increasing and decreasing them, with constant changes. This has brought many difficulties and confusion to the factories.

    Here are a few examples:

    When the socialist competition campaign reached its climax, Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory revised its production plan, increasing it by 80% compared to the original. Although this plan was not easy, the task for the first half of the year was exceeded through the efforts of the workers, and the product quality was relatively stable. It seemed that completing the annual target would not be a big problem. The difficulty in the second half of the year lies in the supply of materials and collaborative products. Although there are difficulties, there are also solutions. The shortage of steel is not large, and it can be basically resolved through mutual exchange with fraternal factories, processing good steel from waste products, and a series of measures such as saving materials. The shortage of pig iron is greater, and they have already begun to recover a large amount of scrap iron and steel inside and outside the factory, and the pig iron problem can also be solved. In this way, even if the state does not allocate materials, this factory can continue production as usual. However, its superior authorities, when universally reducing plans in May, insisted on reducing the production plan of 300 machine tools for this factory. (Not long ago, its superior authorities had also requested this factory to increase production!) Although this factory complied with the order and revised the plan, considering that there was no major problem with the factory's production capacity and material supply, even if there were problems with the ball bearings supplied by other factories, it would at most affect some assembly work. Weighing the pros and cons, it braced itself and "reduced the plan on paper but not in practice," and continued production according to the original plan. This way, it continued to operate and operated well. However, recently, its superior authorities issued another order, requiring it to further reduce the production target by more than 90 machine tools. The factory director naturally had objections, believing that this was simply treating the factory as a pancake stall, where it could be made and consumed on demand, or not made if not needed.

    The situation at Shenyang Air Compressor Factory is also similar. In May, when the director of this factory heard about the possibility of reducing the plan, he took the initiative to go to Beijing to strive for no reduction. The responsible industrial ministry and administration, hearing that he had no problem with materials (the main reason for the production cuts was material problems), agreed not to reduce. The factory had just settled down when, in mid-July, a telephone order suddenly came from Beijing, ordering an immediate reduction of 20% in the annual target! What exactly is the basis for this order? The factory has basically enough steel, but is still short of 500 tons of pig iron. Searching the factory for scrap steel and iron can also solve the problem. Based on this situation, even if it is not a complete absence of reduction, it is possible to reduce it less. If this order is executed, it is almost equivalent to canceling the task for one quarter, and the number of personnel will be reduced by one-third to one-half. With such a setback, based on the lessons of the massive production cuts in 1954, the factory's vitality could not be restored for two years. How can this be allowed! The factory director couldn't help but complain: "Increasing production has its hardships, but it is not a real hardship; the hardship of factory directors is greater than reducing production."

    What is more common and more worrying is the constant increase and decrease, which are constantly changing. The plan initially determined by Shenyang Water Pump Factory was 8,800 units, which was reduced to 6,900 units in May, with the total output value reduced by half. The responsible administration said: "Not even one more unit is allowed!" Not many days after the words were spoken, an order came in June, in addition to ensuring an increase of 130 units to supply overseas needs, it was also necessary to increase production as much as possible by 1,000 to 2,000 units, and materials could also be supplied. Increasing and decreasing again and again, the plan is changed as soon as it is completed, and changed again after it is changed. Repeatedly, artificially creating chaos, making the factory directors complain incessantly.

    Why do the superior authorities of these factories, which could have avoided or reduced the scale of the plan cuts, insist on drastically reducing them? This question needs to be answered by their superior authorities—the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the various relevant administrations under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry.

    Some comrades have such a view that some comrades above do not conduct specific analysis based on the actual situation, but only look at what wind is blowing. If it is anti-conservatism, they uniformly require increasing, increasing, and increasing; if it is anti-rash advance, they uniformly require reducing, reducing, and reducing, and they must reduce regardless of the circumstances. In advance, they did not discuss it well with the factory, but simply sat in the office and calculated the percentage, and "you eat one less bowl, and he eats one less bowl." They see things very simply. When the superiors change a number, many people below have to rack their brains for this number. In the first half of this year, the planning departments of many factories did nothing but busy themselves modifying the plan all day long in a daze. If it only affects the work of the planning department, the problem is not big. But the plan is the outline of all actions of the factory. If the annual plan changes constantly, the quarterly and monthly plans cannot be arranged, the production preparation will be at a loss, and all the chaos will start from here. The most difficult thing to deal with is that after a large number of production cuts, the enterprise has insufficient tasks and a large surplus of personnel... What should be done about these problems?

    It is already August, but the annual plan of some factories is still being increased and decreased to this day, and it is certainly not settled. This is the most troubling problem for the leaders of many factories in Shenyang, and it is also related to the continued in-depth development of the advanced producers' movement. The pressing demand of the factory leaders at present is: the factories that can avoid reducing or reduce the tasks as little as possible, try to avoid reducing or reducing them as little as possible! If it is really necessary to reduce, I hope to finalize the plan as soon as possible!

    厂长们的苦恼
    本报记者　金雨困
    今年是沈阳市的国营机械工厂计划变动最频繁的一年。到目前为止，变动得多的已达八次，少的也有三次；而且有的厂还在继续变动中。其中变动最大的有两次：一次是在年初反右倾保守思想的时候，主要是增，而且增得很多，总产值一般要比去年增加50％到一倍以上；另一次是在五月前后，主要是减，大部分工厂都削掉全年任务10％到25％，减得也是不少。
    年初的增，现在看来，大体上还是有根据的、合理的。上半年完成计划的情况基本上也是好的，大部分工厂完成和超额完成了主要指标。产品质量总的趋势也是上升的。产品销路也没有问题，大部分产品都是供不应求。就是这样，工厂的生产能力也还没有得到充分发挥，沈阳第一机床厂设备利用率仅达66％，其它一些厂也在60％左右。目前唯一威胁着工厂生产的是材料供应和协作产品供应紧张。造成紧张的原因，主要是材料来源不足；另外，计划变动太多，临时准备不及，也加剧了这种紧张状况。如果要说有冒进倾向的话，主要就是对这方面的情况估计不足。
    五月份的减，也就是由于材料供应和协作产品供应紧张而引起的。没有材料，当然无法进行生产，适当削减计划是必要的。同时，使任务比较紧张的工厂适当地减轻一下任务，这对更好地照顾新产品试制和为明年生产作些必要的准备，也是有利的。
    但是，在最近这次计划变动中发生了一些问题。
    最近，我和一些厂长同志交谈的时候，他们对年初的增加任务一般意见不大。他们深感苦恼的，是最近的大量削减计划。计划削减得合理的，意见也不太多。厂长们最不满意的，是一些工厂本来可以不削减或者少削减，但是主管的工业部和管理局却一声命令硬要他们大量削减计划，或者是忽增忽减，变化无常。这给工厂带来了很多困难和混乱。
    下边就有这样的几个例子。
    沈阳第二机床厂在社会主义竞赛高潮到来的时候，修改了生产计划，比原来提高了80％。这个计划虽不轻松，但是经过职工努力，上半年的任务超额完成了，产品质量也比较稳定。看来，完成全年任务问题不大。下半年的困难是在材料和协作产品的供应方面。困难虽有，但办法也有。钢材所缺不多，通过同兄弟厂互通有无、利用废品中的好钢进行加工，以及节约用料等一系列的措施，基本上已经可以解决。缺得多的是生铁，他们已经开始在厂内外大量回收废铁废钢，生铁问题也可以解决了。这样，就是国家不调拨材料，这个厂也可以照常进行生产。可是，它的上级机关在五月份普遍削减计划的时候，却硬要这个厂削减三百台机床的生产计划。（不久以前，它的上级机关还曾经要求这个厂增加生产呢！）这个工厂虽然遵令修改了计划，但是考虑到厂里生产能力和材料供应都没有多大问题，即使外厂供应的滚珠发生了问题，最多也是影响一部分装配工作，权衡利弊，便硬着头皮“明减暗不减”，仍然按照原计划进行生产。这样也就干下去了，而且干得不坏。可是，最近它的上级机关又来了命令，要它再减九十多台机床的生产任务。厂长当然不能没有意见，认为这简直是把工厂当成了煎饼铺，可以现吃现做，不吃不做。
    沈阳空气压缩机厂的情况也差不多。五月里，这个厂的厂长听到要削减计划的风声，就主动地跑到北京争取不减。主管的工业部和管理局听他说材料没有问题（减产的主要理由是材料问题），也就同意不减。工厂里刚刚安下心来，七月中旬忽然又从北京传来电话命令，要立即削减全年任务20％！究竟这个命令的根据是什么呢？这个厂钢材基本上已经够了，生铁还缺五百吨，把厂里的废钢废铁搜一搜也可以解决问题。根据这样的情况，即使不是完全不减，也是可以少减的。如果按照这个命令执行，差不多就等于取消了一个季度的任务，人员要减少三分之一到二分之一。这样一折腾，根据1954年大量减产的教训，工厂的元气两年都恢复不过来。这怎么得了！厂长不禁叫苦说：“增产有苦，但算不得真苦；厂长之苦，莫大于减产。”
    更普遍和更使人伤脑筋的，是忽增忽减，变化无常。沈阳水泵厂年初确定的计划是八千八百台，五月份削减到六千九百台，总产值减了一半。主管的管理局说：“多产一台也不行！”话说了没有几天，六月份又来了命令，除了保证增产一百三十台供应国外需要以外，还要尽可能增产一、两千台，材料也可以供应。增了又减，减了又增，计划编完就变，变了就再编。反反复复，人为地制造着混乱，弄得厂长们都不能不叫苦连天。
    为什么这些本来可以不削减或者少削减计划的工厂，它们的上级机关却硬要大量削减呢？这个问题，需要它们的上级机关——第一机械工业部和第一机械工业部所属各个有关的管理局来答复。
    有的同志有这样一种看法，认为上面有这样一些同志，他们不根据实际情况进行具体分析，而是只看刮什么风，如果是反保守，就一律要求增、增、增；如果是反冒进，就一律要求减、减、减，而且是不问情由非减不可。事先，他们也没有很好地同厂里商量一下，只是坐在办公室里算一下百分比，就“你也少吃一碗，他也少吃一碗。”把事情看得很简单。上面变动一个数目字的时候，下面许多人就要为这个数目字弄得焦头烂额。今年上半年，许多工厂的计划部门什么事也没有干，只是整天在昏头胀脑地忙着修改计划。如果仅仅影响计划部门的工作，那问题还不大。但是计划是工厂一切行动的纲领，年计划变化无常，季和月的计划就无法安排，生产准备就无所适从，一切混乱就从这里开始。最难处理的是大量减产以后，企业任务不足，人员大量剩余……这些问题又怎么办？
    现在已经是八月了，但是有的工厂的年计划到现在还在增增减减，肯定不下来。这是沈阳市不少工厂领导人员最苦恼的问题，也是关系到继续深入开展先进生产者运动的问题。目前工厂领导人员的迫切要求是：能够不减或者少减任务的工厂，就尽可能不减或少减吧！如果实在非减不可，也希望尽速把计划肯定下来！
