Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 8th. Tianjin is vigorously transferring flood control equipment to support East and North China. From the 1st to the 8th, Tianjin's railway stations have shipped out 220,000麻袋 (mádài: gunny sacks/burlap sacks), as well as reeds, galvanized wire and other materials, totaling more than 1,000 tons.

According to the instructions of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau, all railway stations are handling flood control materials as soon as they arrive, giving priority to loading and urgent dispatch. The galvanized wire supplied by the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces has all been transferred. In the past week, this purchasing and supply station has also supplied 33,500 iron shovels to various regions for flood control earthworks. Six of Tianjin's twelve iron shovel factories have switched to two-shift, day and night production, and the iron shovels produced are sent directly from the workshops to the railway station for shipment.

On the 7th, Tianjin also shipped 60,000斤 (jīn: a Chinese unit of weight, about 500g) of winter melon and other vegetables to support the Shanghai market, which had been hit by typhoons. On the 8th, another 50 tons of galvanized wire were shipped to Shanghai for house repairs and other purposes.
