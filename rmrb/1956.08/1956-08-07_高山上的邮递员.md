    The Postman on the High Mountains
    Qiu Shousheng, a postman in the Beishan District of Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, has traveled more than 40,000 li (approximately 20,000 kilometers or 12,400 miles) in the Tiantai Mountains over the past two years, delivering mail to farmers and government offices.
    Beishan District is located in the famous Tiantai Mountains of Zhejiang Province, an area full of towering peaks and steep mountains. It takes farmers at least three days to travel to the county seat, making it very inconvenient to write letters and subscribe to newspapers. In 1954, a postal route was opened here. From October 1 of that year, Qiu Shousheng began to carry a mailbag weighing thirty to forty jin (approximately 15 to 20 kilograms or 33 to 44 pounds), traveling along this route.
    Qiu Shousheng established two lodging points along the way. On the first day, he would travel seventy li (approximately 35 kilometers or 22 miles) from the first lodging point, Longhuangtang, to the county post office to collect mail and return on the same day. Then, he would spend two days delivering and collecting mail along the 140-li (approximately 70 kilometers or 43 miles) postal route. In this way, Qiu Shousheng made a circuit every three days, braving the scorching heat of summer or the biting cold winds of winter, constantly traveling in the Tiantai Mountains.
    One day in January of this year, the weather was very cold and the wind was particularly strong. Qiu Shousheng had to climb the main peak of the Tiantai Mountains, which is twenty li (approximately 10 kilometers or 6 miles) long and 1,100 meters (approximately 3,600 feet) high, from Huafeng Township to Datong Township. The mountain was covered in ice, and Qiu Shousheng had already fallen seven times before reaching halfway. At this point, he felt he couldn't take it anymore and wanted to turn back. But then he thought, how disappointed the people in Datong Township who were waiting for letters and newspapers would be if he didn't go. He finally mustered his courage and climbed over the mountain. Because of his courage to overcome difficulties, he had not missed a single delivery in twenty-two months.
    The people in Beishan District welcomed Qiu Shousheng very much, affectionately calling him "Old Qiu." Sun Shiping, a teacher at Datong Township Elementary School, often waited for Qiu Shousheng at the door when he was about to arrive. Sun Shiping said to him, "You don't know how useful the newspapers and 'Educational Communications' you bring are to me!" Last year, when Huafeng Township was carrying out the "Three Fixes" for grain (fixed production, fixed purchase, fixed sales), the township cadres were worried about their lack of experience. The newspaper Old Qiu delivered introduced the experience of a township in Yin County, and everyone was extremely excited and immediately began to study it. Soon, the Three Fixes task of this township was completed.

    高山上的邮递员
    浙江省天台县北山区的邮递员裘守省，两年来在天台山上为农民和机关送递邮件，奔走了四万多里山路。
    北山区在浙江省著名的天台山区里，到处都是丛山峻岭。农民到县里去一趟至少要三天，写信订报十分不便。1954年，这里开辟了一条邮运线。从那一年的十月一日起，裘守省就开始背着三四十斤重的邮包，在这条线上奔走。
    裘守省在沿途建立了两个住处。第一天，他从第一个住处龙皇堂到县邮局领取邮件，当天赶回，共行走七十里。然后再用两天时间，沿着长达一百四十里的邮运线投递和收取邮件。就这样，裘守省三天一圈，冒着盛暑的酷热或是冬天刺骨的寒风，循环奔走在天台山上。
    今年一月里的一天，天气很冷，风特别大。裘守省从华峰乡到大同乡去，要爬过二十里长、一千一百公尺高的天台山主峰。山上满结着冰块，裘守省才爬到半山，已经摔了七跤。这时，他觉得实在吃不消，想中途折回。但他又想，要是不去，大同乡盼信盼报的人会多失望呵。他终于鼓起勇气，爬过了这座大山。由于勇于克服困难，二十二个月来他没有耽误过一次投递。
    北山区的人很欢迎裘守省，亲热地叫他“老裘”。大同乡小学的教师孙士培常常在裘守省快来的时候到门口等他。孙士培对他说：“你不知道你送来的报纸和‘教育通讯’对我多有用！”去年华峰乡搞粮食三定的时候，乡干部正愁没有经验，老裘送来的报纸上介绍了鄞县一个乡的经验，大家兴奋极了，连忙学习。不久，这个乡的三定任务就完成了。
