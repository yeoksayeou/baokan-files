Around a Dining Table
    Yuan Shuipai

Japanese, Australians, Mexicans, Chinese, people from this side of the earth and that side of the earth, sit in a circle around a dining table. The peaches in the dishes emit a ripe fragrance, and in the porcelain vase, pale purple irises bloom. In Beijing in August 1956, we are talking about Hiroshima in August 1945. [Note]

“It was a morning just like any other, a clear sky without clouds, but, in an instant, an intense flash like a burning fire,
        Dust rose ten thousand feet, obscuring the sun, the hands of the clocks in Hiroshima stopped at eight fifteen.”

The painter Iri Maruki, an elder with a slightly hunched back, modestly waves his hand, letting his wife speak. Toshi Maruki (née Akamatsu), with a kind face and bangs, softly recounts the tragic history of eleven years ago.

“When Maruki rushed from Tokyo to see his home, his father, uncle, and two nephews were all dead. The limbs of the dead and the undead were piled on top of each other, the injured and the mentally disturbed wandered in the ruins. To avoid making it unbearable to watch, we did not allow ourselves to depict the cruel scenes one by one.”

Ten giant paintings displayed a man-made hell: a pair of young sisters knelt and hugged each other, ceasing to breathe; a mother stuffed a nipple into the mouth of the child in her arms, but his little mouth would never open again...

  The old man’s kind, wrinkled face,
  The baby's plump, soft fingers,
  The man's stalwart physique,
  The woman’s full limbs,
  Ah, these are the noble and dignified images of us humans!
  This is youth as beautiful as a flower!
    Love as deep as the sea!
  Who dares to destroy them?
  Who dares to commit such an unspeakable crime,
  Is it a beast, or a human?
  Ah, the seven rivers of Hiroshima, all flowing into the ocean,
  Each floating with corpses,
        Wife and child,
          Husband and daughter,
            Grandfather and grandchild,
            Lovers and mother!
  Thick smoke, poisonous fog, sea of fire, fresh blood...

  The past is far away from these peaceful years,
  But how tightly it grips our hearts!
  Let these silent, open mouths, raised hands,
  Serve as permanent witnesses to history!
  Let people from this side of the earth and that side of the earth,
  Sit in a circle around a dining table,
  And resolve:
  To forever prevent atomic war!

   [Note] On the preview day of the "Atomic Bomb Disaster Paintings," some international friends in Beijing and two Japanese painters chatted at the Art Exhibition Hall.

    在一张餐桌周围
    袁水拍日本人，澳洲人，墨西哥人，中国人，地球这一边的人和那一边的人，团团地坐在一张餐桌周围。盘子里的蜜桃发出成熟的芳香，瓷瓶里，淡紫色的鸢尾花盛开。在1956年8月的北京，我们说着1945年8月广岛。〔注〕“那是一个和平常一样的早晨，晴空无云，但是，一霎那，强烈的闪光像火烫，
        万丈尘土遮太阳，广岛的钟表的指针停在八点十五分。”微微弯背的长者般的画家丸木位里，谦逊地摆着手，让他夫人说话。有着和善的脸、飘着刘海的赤松俊子轻声地追述着十一年前的悲痛历史。“等到丸木从东京赶去看他的家时，他的父亲，伯父，两个侄子都死了。已死者和未死者的肢体交叠成堆，伤者和神经失常者在废墟里徘徊。为了不使人看不下去，我们不容许自己把惨酷的情景一一都描绘。”十幅巨画展示了一座人造地狱：一对幼小的姊妹相跪相抱着停止了呼吸，母亲把奶头塞给怀里的小孩，可是他的小嘴再也不会张开……
  老人的慈祥的绉脸，
  婴儿的肥软的手指，
  男子的魁伟的体魄，
  女性的丰满的肢体，
  啊，这是我们人类的高贵的庄严的形象啊！
  这是花一般美的青春！
    海一般深的爱情！
  是谁敢于损毁他们？
  敢于犯这样不可名状的罪的，
  是兽，还是人？
  啊，广岛七条河，条条入海洋，
  条条飘浮着尸体，
        妻和子，
          夫和女，
            祖和孙，
            恋人和母亲！
  浓烟，毒雾，火海，鲜血……
  往事已经远离这和平的岁月，
  但又是多么紧紧地绞着我们的心啊！
  让这些无声的、张开的口，高举的手，
  作历史的永久的见证吧！
  让地球这一边的人和那一边的人，
  团团地坐在一张餐桌周围，
  立下决心：
  永远制止原子战争！
   〔注〕“原子弹灾害图”预展日，在北京的一些国际友人们和两位日本画家在美术展览馆叙谈。
