    Nanhai Sugar Factory Speeds Up Construction
    One of the ten sugar factories being built in our country this year—the state-owned Nanhai Sugar Factory—is being stepped up in construction at Daping Market, Nanhai County, Guangdong Province. This sugar factory is expected to be put into production in the next pressing season. Once put into production, it can press two thousand tons of sugar cane a day. This is the exterior view of the boiling workshop and pressing workshop with the civil engineering nearing completion. Xinhua News Agency reporter Cai Zhongzhi photo

    南海糖厂加紧施工
    我国今年兴建的十大糖厂之一——国营南海糖厂正在广东省南海县大平墟加紧建设。这个糖厂预计在明年榨季就可投入生产。投入生产以后，一天能榨两千吨甘蔗。这是接近完成土建工程的煮炼车间、压榨车间的外景。　　新华社记者　蔡忠植摄
