Xinhua News Agency, Tangyuan, August 12th. A sideline production brigade composed of six hundred people has left Tangyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, and entered the mountainous areas. This is the first batch of sideline production forces organized by the Tangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in order to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives affected by the flood and lay the foundation for next year's production. They are going to the forest area to carry out large-scale sideline production such as logging, clearing forest farms, and transporting timber. In the next ten days, approximately five thousand more farmers will enter the mountains for sideline production.

According to preliminary calculations by the County Committee, these sideline productions, from now until the spring plowing next year, can bring farmers an income of more than 100,000 yuan.

The recent flood forced farmers from eight agricultural production cooperatives in Tangyuan County to move because their villages and land were almost completely submerged. Some villages also suffered water damage to some of their land, resulting in low production morale among some farmers, who were worried about production and livelihood next year. Some farmers went out to find sideline production on their own, and the organization of agricultural production cooperatives began to disintegrate. After discovering this situation, the Tangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately contacted the forestry departments and, with the assistance of the Huanan Forest Industry Bureau, the Dailing Forest Nursery Station, and the Haolianghe Management Office in the Yichun Forest Area, found a large number of sideline production opportunities in the forest area. At the same time, the Communist Party organizations at all levels in Tangyuan County also helped the elderly and women at home find more than ten kinds of scattered sideline productions.

During the intense flood prevention period, in order to ensure that floods did not damage farmland, the farmers decided to first let six hundred immigrants from inside the pass and farmers who were more severely affected go to engage in sideline production in order to increase their income. After the flood season, the remaining farmers also set off one after another.

    农业生产受了损失用副业生产来补
    汤原县组织大批水灾区农民开展副业生产增加收入
    新华社汤原12日电　一支由六百人组成的副业生产大队已经离开黑龙江省汤原县进入山林地区。这是中共汤原县委会为了使这次受水灾的农业生产合作社得到巩固和为明年生产打下基础而组织的第一批副业生产大军。他们是前往林区进行采伐、清理林场和运材等大宗副业生产的。今后十天里将还有大约五千名农民入山进行副业生产。
    根据县委初步计算，这些副业生产从现在作到明年春耕前，可使农民能收入十多万元。
    最近这次洪水，迫使汤原县有八个农业生产合作社的农民搬了家，因为他们的村庄和土地几乎都被淹。还有一些村庄的部分土地也遭受水害，致使一些农民生产情绪低落，耽心明年生产和生活没有着落，有些农民就自己出去找副业生产，农业生产合作社的组织开始涣散起来。中共汤原县委会发现这种情况后，立即和林业部门联系，在桦南森林工业局、带岭森林抚育站和伊春林区浩良河经营所等单位的协助下，在林区找到了大量的副业生产门路。同时，汤原县的各级共产党组织，还帮助在家的老年人和妇女找到了十多种零星的副业生产。
    在紧张的防汛期间，为了保证不让洪水淹害农田，农民决定先让六百名关内移民和受害较重的农民去进行副业生产，以便增加他们的收入。汛期过后，其余农民也陆续出发。
