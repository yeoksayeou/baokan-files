Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet, entrenched in the Taiwan Strait, was active in the waters off our Shengsi and Dachen Islands yesterday and today, and dispatched naval aircraft in eighteen batches totaling fifty-four sorties to intrude into the airspace over our Shengsi Islands for military provocations.

On the morning of August 23rd, a large number of ships and carrier-based aircraft of the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet appeared in the sea southeast of Dachen Island and over its airspace. Some of the ships entered the waters near the Zhoushan Islands at dawn on the 24th. From 00:00 to 16:30 on the 24th, U.S. Navy aircraft in eighteen batches totaling fifty-four sorties intruded into the airspace over the Shengsi Islands, Huanao Mountain, Changtu Mountain, Zhujiajian and other islands, carrying out military provocations against us. This is another serious provocation against the Chinese people, following the intrusion of two U.S. military aircraft into our northeastern airspace on January 9th of this year, and the intrusion of three batches of six U.S. Navy aircraft into our coastal airspace of Zhejiang on January 18th.
