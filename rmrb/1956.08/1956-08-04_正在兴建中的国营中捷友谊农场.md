    On the Bohai beach in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, a state-run mechanized farm focusing on cotton cultivation is under construction. This is the State-Run China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Farm.

    The emergence of this farm is rapidly changing the face of the beach. Just a few months ago, this was a sparsely populated, barren saline-alkali wasteland. Now, near the farm headquarters' temporary thatched houses, more than two hundred workers are busy building houses. It is expected that more than 1,200 new brick and tile houses will be completed before the ground freezes this year. Newly dug large and small canals, and newly built roads of various types, have divided the area of more than 140,000 mu into countless neat rectangular plots. The roar of tractors can be heard day and night. The original flat, hard barren land has been turned into loose arable land. To date, the farm has reclaimed more than 30,000 mu of land. Among them, over 11,000 mu of land that has been desalinated by diverting river water for silt irrigation has had its original gray-white saline-alkali soil eliminated; the salt content of the topsoil has been reduced from 1.5% to 3% in the past to less than 0.17%. The first trial planting of 1,900 mu of cotton has resulted in the emergence of most of the seedlings. Now the cotton plants are growing strong and are dark green, with the taller ones already over a foot high and bearing three or four buds. The trial planting of corn, soybeans and other crops has also resulted in the emergence of some seedlings, and their growth is generally normal.

    A set of agricultural machinery equipment donated by the Czechoslovak government to our government to equip this farm has been transported to Cangxian, and most of it has been installed. This set of agricultural machinery equipment includes 34 types of equipment, totaling more than 670 pieces, including tractors, automatic combine harvesters, mobile repair vehicles, trucks, and various agricultural implements. Soon, these machines will arrive at the farm to be used for reclaiming the beach wasteland and other tasks.

    The Czechoslovakian machinery experts who came to help the farm train tractor drivers and install machinery arrived in Cangxian as early as May 29. For more than a month, whether in the tractor driver training class or in the open-air square where the machines were being installed, they have always been so patient in helping and guiding the trainees, giving sincere assistance to our socialist construction cause.

    During the first tractor driver training class, although the expert guest house was more than half a kilometer away from the training class location, and the roads were muddy and difficult to navigate due to heavy rain for several days, the teaching experts were never late. Sometimes, they continued to answer trainees' questions after class. In order to combine the teaching of courses with practical demonstrations, expert Novak did not rest for two days at noon, seizing the time to troubleshoot an electrical fault in a tractor engine. The first training class was originally planned to take fifteen days to teach the characteristics, structural principles, use and maintenance of tractors, but with the efforts of the experts, it was completed in only ten days, and the teaching effect was good.

    During the days of installing machines in the open-air square, it was the particularly hot months of June and July. The experts still often arrived at the site early and were reluctant to leave after work. Every day, the experts personally moved and lifted machine parts, installed machines, and test-drove them. Although they were covered in sweat and their work clothes were stained with oil, they still cheerfully taught the trainees to carry out these tasks together. One day, the leader of the expert group, Radl Loski, accidentally broke his leg when he jumped down from a locomotive. People advised him to go back and rest, but he repeatedly shook his head and waved his hand, insisting on continuing to work. The next day, he caught a cold from the heat, but no matter how others dissuaded him, he still went out to work as usual. The experts' enthusiastic help greatly encouraged the trainees' enthusiasm for work and significantly accelerated the progress of the installation work. During the installation of the automatic combine harvester, the eleven trainees in the farm implements group initially installed one unit in more than four days, then installed one unit in more than two days, and finally managed to install one unit in one day. In this way, the experts and trainees completed the installation of all the machines in just over twenty days.

    This farm is twelve kilometers east of Bohai Bay, with flat terrain and a mild climate, allowing for three crops every two years or two crops a year. Recently, the planned total area of the farm has been increased from the original 140,000 mu to more than 160,000 mu. In addition to maintaining the originally planned 100,000 mu of arable land, 20,000 mu of pastureland has been newly added. The rest is occupied by houses, canals, etc. After the farm is fully completed and put into production in 1957, it will be able to produce a large quantity of cotton, grain, and pork for the country every year, and will also develop horse herds, cattle herds, and sheep flocks. In 1958, the farm will officially implement a cotton and grain rotation system with cotton as the main crop. (Attached image)

    正在兴建中的国营中捷友谊农场
    新华社记者　邓子常
    在河北省黄骅县境内的渤海滩上，正在兴建一个以种植棉花为主的国营机械农场，这就是国营中捷友谊农场。
    这个农场的出现，正在迅速地改变着海滩的面貌。几个月前，这里还是一片人家稀少、随处有灰白色盐碱的海滩荒地。现在，在农场场部临时草房的附近，二百多工人正忙着建造房屋，预计到今年结冻前可以建成一千二百多间新的砖瓦房。新挖好的大、小沟渠，新修成的各种道路，把面积达十四万多亩的大地，划分成了无数整齐的长方形的地块。白天和黑夜都能够听到拖拉机的吼声。原来平板、死硬的荒地，变成了松软的耕田。到目前为止，农场共已开垦出三万多亩地。其中经过引用河水淤灌洗碱的一万一千多亩地，原有的灰白色盐碱已经消失；表土含盐量由过去1.5％到3％，降低到千分之零点一七以下。第一次试种的一千九百亩棉花，绝大部分出苗。现在棉棵长得健壮，呈深绿色，高的已有一尺多，并且著蕾三、四个。试种的玉米、大豆等农作物，也有一部分出苗，一般生育正常。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府赠送我国政府用来装备这个农场的一套农业机器设备，已经运到了沧县，并且大部分已经安装完毕。这套农业机器设备包括拖拉机、自动联合收割机、移动式修配车、载重汽车和各种农机具等三十四种，共六百七十多件。不久，这些机器就要到达农场，用来进行开垦海滩荒地等工作。
    前来帮助农场训练拖拉机手和安装机器的捷克斯洛伐克的机务专家们，早在五月二十九日就到达了沧县。一个多月来，无论是在拖拉机手训练班里，还是在安装机器的露天广场上，他们对学员们总是那么耐心地进行帮助和指导，对我国社会主义建设事业给予了真诚的援助。
    在开办第一期拖拉机手训练班的期间，虽然专家招待所离这个训练班的地方有一里多远，有几天下大雨道路泥泞难行，可是担任教学的专家从来没有迟到过，有时下课后还要继续给学员们解答疑难问题。专家诺瓦克为了作到讲授课程和实际表演相结合，有两天中午不休息，抓紧时间把一台拖拉机的发动机电气故障排除了。这一期训练班原计划用十五天来讲授拖拉机的特点、构造原理、使用和保养，在专家们的努力下只用十天就讲完了，而且教学效果良好。
    在露天广场上安装机器的日子里，正是天气特别炎热的六、七月间。专家们还是经常提前到达现场，下班后迟迟不肯离去。每天，专家们总是亲自动手搬抬机器部件，安装机器和试车。他们虽然累得浑身是汗，工作服上沾满油污，仍是愉快地教导学员们一起进行这些工作。有一天，专家组长拉德尔拉斯基从机车上往下跳，不小心摔坏了腿，人们劝他回去休息，但他连连摇头摆手，仍然坚持工作。第二天，他又受热感冒，可是不管别人怎样劝阻，他还是照常出去工作。专家们的热心帮助，大大鼓舞了学员们的工作热情，显著地加快了安装工作的进度。农具一组十一个学员在安装自动联合收割机的期间，最初四天多安装好一台，以后两天多安装好一台，最后作到了一天安装好一台。就这样，专家们和学员们只用二十多天，就把全部机器安装完毕。
    这个农场东距渤海湾十二公里，地势平坦，气候温和，可以两年三作或一年两作。最近，农场的设计总面积由原定十四万多亩增加到十六万多亩。除保持原计划十万多亩耕地外，新增加了二万亩牧场。其余是房屋、沟渠等占地。到1957年农场全部建成投入生产后，每年就可以为国家生产大批棉花、粮食和猪肉，还要发展马群、牛群和羊群。1958年农场将正式实行以棉花为主的棉、粮轮作制。（附图片）
