Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th—Recently, two hundred and three jointly owned public-private stores and cooperative stores in seventeen industries in Xi'an, including department stores, watch and glasses stores, and native and mountain product stores, have successively adjusted their labor organizations, giving employees more time for rest, recreation, and study.

Department stores, whose relationship with consumers is close, have sufficient manpower, and have relatively good conditions, mostly implemented continuous shifts or rotating work schedules. Currently, they still maintain business hours of more than thirteen hours, while employees have three hours of rest during the day. Daily working hours have been shortened from thirteen hours in the past to ten hours, and they can also rest one day a week. The previous situation where employees of these stores frequently couldn't find time to study and handle personal matters has changed. The native product agency stores, which specialize in selling local and special products for out-of-town visitors, have adjusted their labor organization based on passenger and freight transportation schedules and business volume. While maintaining the original operating characteristics of receiving visitors upon arrival, employee working hours have also been shortened to eight hours. Employees of six native product agency stores, including the jointly owned Zheng Da Xing and Fu Ju Heng, have recently organized entertainment groups and are carrying out entertainment activities due to the reduction of working hours. The stores are confident in exceeding their July business plan.

In the past six months, most of these jointly owned public-private stores and cooperative stores have maintained their original labor organization forms and business hours. However, with the increasing prosperity of the market, the turnover of each store has increased, and the workload of employees has also continuously increased. At the same time, because employees previously lacked fixed work schedules, many people's rest and study were not guaranteed. Before adjusting the labor organization this time, each store, with the help of state-owned commercial specialized companies, conducted investigations and research on the store's manpower, operating characteristics, and business volume. All stores that have adjusted their labor organization have generally shortened employee working hours while retaining the store's original operating habits and characteristics.

    西安市部分合营商店调整劳动组织
    缩短了职工工作时间保留了原有经营特点
    新华社西安30日电　西安市百货、钟表眼镜、土产山货等十七个行业的两百零三户公私合营商店和合作商店，最近先后调整了劳动组织，使职工有了较多的休息、娱乐和学习时间。
    和消费者关系密切、人力充裕和条件比较好的百货业各公私合营商店，大部分实行了连带上班制或循环作息办法，现在对外营业仍保持在十三小时以上，而职工们日间都有三个小时的休息，每天的工作时间由过去的十三小时缩短为十小时，每周还可以休息一天，过去这些商店的职工经常抽不出时间学习和处理私人事务等情况已经有改变。专门代理外地来客出售土产品特产品的土产代理业各公私合营商店，根据客货运输行车时间和业务忙闲情况，调整劳动组织以后，既保持了原来对来客随到随接的经营特点，职工工作时间也缩短到了八小时。公私合营正大兴、福聚恒等六个土产代理商店的职工，因为工作时间缩短，最近组织了文娱小组，开展文娱活动。商店七月份的营业计划也有把握超额完成。
    半年来，这些公私合营商店和合作商店大部分保持了原来的劳动组织形式和营业时间，但随着市场日益繁荣，各商店营业额增大，职工的工作量也不断增加，同时因为职工们过去作息无一定制度，许多人休息、学习得不到保证。这次在调整劳动组织以前，各店都在国营商业专业公司的帮助下，对商店人力、经营特点、业务忙闲等情况作了调查研究，已经调整了劳动组织的各店，一般都缩短了职工的工作时间，同时保留了商店原有的经营习惯和经营特点。
