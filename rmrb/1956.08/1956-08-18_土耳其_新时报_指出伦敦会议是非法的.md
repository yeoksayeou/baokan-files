Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, August 16th (TASS) – The Turkish newspaper "New Times" published an article criticizing the methods used by Western countries in convening the London Conference. The article stated, "Since the Suez Canal is entirely within Egyptian territory, Egypt should be the primary initiator of the conference. However, the problem is not only that Egypt is not among the initiators, but even that its consent was not obtained beforehand. Among the initiators is the United States, but Egypt, whose territory the canal runs through, is not."

    土耳其“新时报”
    指出伦敦会议是非法的
    新华社据塔斯社伊斯坦布尔16日讯　土耳其“新时报”载文指责西方国家在召开伦敦会议问题上所使用的方法。文章写道，“既然苏彝士运河完全在埃及境内，埃及就应该是主要的会议发起国。但是，问题还不仅是埃及没有在发起国之列，甚至还没有事先取得它的同意。在发起国中有美国，但却没有运河流过它的领土的埃及。”
