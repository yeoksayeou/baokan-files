Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th: The Soviet Council of Ministers decided on August 21st to transfer a set of so-called Manchurian Archives (documentary materials from various yamens in China's Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces from 1675 to 1900) preserved in the Soviet State Archives to the People's Republic of China. This set of archives was taken from Qiqihar by the Tsarist Russian army in 1901.

This set of archives includes valuable materials for the study of China's foreign relations, the economic and political development of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, the history of Sino-Russian relations, and the civil and military administration of these two provinces, the social composition of the residents, land relations, the development of agriculture and trade, the construction of roads and water conservancy projects, the military situation, maps, and other information, which has been little studied in historical science.

This set of Manchurian archives is of great historical value and can serve as basic material for the study of the history of Northeast China from the 17th to the 19th centuries.

    苏联把满洲档案交还我国
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联部长会议八月二十一日决定把苏联国家档案库中保存的一套所谓满洲档案（中国黑龙江和吉林两省各衙署1675年到1900年的文献资料）移交给中华人民共和国。这套档案是沙俄军队1901年从齐齐哈尔运走的。
    这套档案包括历史科学上很少研究过的关于中国对外关系、黑龙江和吉林省的经济和政治发展、中俄关系史的宝贵材料，和这两个省的民政军政问题、居民的社会成分、土地关系、农业和贸易的发展、道路和水利工程建设、军队情况、地图等资料。
    这套满洲档案在历史学上有重大的价值，它可以作为研究中国东北十七—十九世纪历史的基本资料。
