    Repairing Tea Pavilions
    I have traveled several remote roads between urban and rural areas. Along the way, I saw that most of the roadside, field, and mountain pavilions and temples were in disrepair, untended, and thus collapsed, damaged, or leaking. Passersby had no place to rest, escape the heat, avoid the rain, or hide. When commune members are working in the fields and encounter a major storm, if they can't escape in time, they have to take temporary shelter in these pavilions (or temples); but these pavilions (or temples) all leak. One day in June of this year, I was returning from a relative's house in Fangkengkou Village when a sudden gale arose, dark clouds gathered, and a heavy rain fell, making the road impassable. So, I had to hurry to get to the dilapidated temple ahead. There were already six or seven people inside, and everyone was talking: "Although this broken temple leaks, it's still better than nothing..." Before the words were finished, a gust of wind blew from the west, and a dozen tiles fell with a "smash!" sound, hitting a woman on the head, causing a large wound that bled profusely. I was lucky enough to only scrape a piece of skin off my face. See how dangerous that was! Another time, the members of our commune were working in a field, and everyone carried some ash fertilizer to the field. When the rain came, there was nothing to cover the ash, so we had to quickly move it into a broken pavilion. Who knew that the pavilion couldn't save it either, and about twelve loads of ash were washed away, leaving only about three loads. See how much was lost!
    Therefore, I suggest that Party organizations, governments, and relevant departments at all levels pay attention to this "small problem" and organize forces to renovate and repair pavilions and temples (agricultural cooperatives in various places should also automatically carry out this work). In places where there were no pavilions and temples originally, it would be best to build new pavilions, so that passersby and commune members would not suffer losses. After repairing or building new ones, a maintenance and management system should be established immediately so that it can serve the people for a long time. In addition, tea water tanks should be set up in certain necessary pavilions. In our local area, there used to be tea pavilions on every road, providing a constant supply of tea, which was a very good habit and should be carried forward. However, now travelers lament: "In recent years, nine out of ten tea pavilions are empty; passersby just can't understand why." "Ten pavilions, nine without water, make travelers miserable." Restoring this work is also very necessary.

    In late June, I traveled from Ninghai to Zhuji, covering 380 li of mountain roads, passing through Tiantai County, Xinchang County, and Sheng County. I passed many tea pavilions, but many of them had no tea to drink. Only a few tea pavilions had some old women doing good deeds, providing tea. Some people carrying heavy loads, during the hottest part of the day, carried their loads to the hilltop pavilion, but had no tea to drink, so they went to the waterside to drink cold water. This can easily cause problems.
    In the past, there was tea to drink, but why is there no tea to drink now? The reason is that the tea fields have joined the cooperative, and the members have not received appropriate work points, so no one is willing to boil water. The tea pavilions are uninhabited and unmanaged, and no one boils tea anymore.
    With the prosperity of the rural economy, it is beneficial to every agricultural cooperative; giving tea to passersby is a good social welfare practice, and agricultural cooperatives should maintain this good tradition.

### 修复茶亭

    修复茶亭
    我曾经先后跑过城乡间的若干偏僻道路，一路上看到路旁、田野、山间的凉亭和庙宇，大多数都是因为年久失修，无人管理，因而倒塌、毁坏或破漏。过路人连歇凉避暑躲雨藏身的场所都没有。社员们在田间劳动生产时，万一遇到一场大风暴雨，逃避不及，只得往凉亭（或庙宇）里暂时躲避一下；可是这些凉亭（或庙宇）都是破漏的。今年六月间的一天，我刚从方坑口村亲戚家回来，半途中忽然狂风猛起，乌云密布，下了一阵很大的暴雨，道路也不能行走。于是，我只得拚命赶着，躲进前边的破庙。这时，里面已经有六七个人了，大伙儿都正在谈论着：“这破庙漏虽然漏，但总算还好，要不……”话没说完，猛地从西边刮来一阵大风，十几片瓦片“啪！”地一声打下来，正好打在一个女人头上，她头上好大一个洞在迸着鲜血。我总算侥幸只擦掉脸上一块皮。你看，这事多危险！还有一次，我们社里的社员在一丘田里干活，大家挑了若干灰肥去下田。暴雨一来，灰没东西遮盖，只好赶紧往一间破凉亭内搬。谁知在凉亭里仍不能挽救它的命运，十二担灰被冲洗得只剩三担左右。你看，这损失多大！
    因此，我建议各地党组织、政府及有关部门，重视这个“小问题”，组织力量进行改建和修复凉亭庙宇的工作（各地农业社也应自动进行这项工作）。原来没有凉亭和庙宇的地方，最好能兴建新的凉亭，以免过路客人和社员们遭遇损失。在修建或新建以后，还应该立即建立护养管理制度，使它能长远地为人民服务。此外在某些必要的凉亭内，应设立茶水缸。我们当地，过去每条路上都设有茶亭，能经常不断地供应茶水，这是一个很好的习惯，应该发扬下去。可是，现在行路的人都叹息道：“近年来十个茶亭九个空；这叫我过路的人们想不通。”“十亭九无水，苦了行路人。”恢复这件工作也是很必要的。

    六月下旬我由宁海到诸暨，走了三百八十里山路，经过天台县、新昌县、嵊县三个县，经过不少茶亭，很多茶亭没有茶吃；只有少数茶亭，一些老妈妈行善心，在施茶。有些挑着重担的人，在中午最热的时候，挑到岭头亭内，没有茶吃，就到水埂去吃冷水了。这是很容易出毛病的。
    过去有茶喝，现在为什么没茶喝了呢？原因是茶田已经入社了，社员们没有得到适当的工分，是没有人去烧的。茶亭无人居住管理，也无人烧茶了。
    农村经济繁荣了，对每个农业社都有利；给过路人喝茶水，是很好的社会福利，农业社应该把这好的传统保持下来。
