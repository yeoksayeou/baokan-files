    A Good Commune Member
    Lin Yuan

    It happened about six months ago. It was during the coldest days of winter. On the flat, boundless fields by the Bohai Sea, a lively atmosphere filled the early morning. Thousands of male and female members of the Bohai Agricultural and Fishery Production Cooperative in Funing County, Hebei Province, were transporting black mud piled up like the Great Wall on the ditch banks to over 45,000 mu of land, load by load, basket by basket, using carts and manpower.

    Several male commune members competed with the female commune members to see who was better and faster at driving the carts. Losing to the female commune members, a young man, a bit embarrassed and angry, recalled the method of comparing physical strength with men that had recently been criticized among the women. He challenged, "You women claim to be good at everything. Who dares to carry a load with me to prove it!"

    "Our Women's Director said not to compete with you in strength!" a young woman, a recent high school graduate participating in agricultural production, said loudly.

    "Why?"

    "We women have special circumstances!"

    "What special circumstances?" As he spoke, the young man winked at his young companions, and everyone burst into laughter.

    A tall and sturdy woman who was shoveling soil into a cart, handed her shovel to her partner and, with a whoosh, grabbed a carrying pole from the ground, saying in a clear voice:

    "Come on! I'll carry with you!"

    Both sides sized up their opponents, rolled up their sleeves, and began the competition amidst cheers. A basket of heavy mud felt as light as a basket of cotton on this woman's shoulder. The two of them carried it back and forth quickly, until it was time for breakfast. After breakfast, when the woman picked up the carrying pole again to carry with the young man, the young man looked like a deflated balloon, his face flushed, and said:

    "I can't do it anymore, find someone else."

    The female commune members erupted in a triumphant cheer, chanting rhythmically:

    "Sun—Cui—rong—is—re—ally—good!"

    Sun Cuirong is a labor model of the Bohai Commune, with a round face and two short, thick braids, and is thirty-one years old this year. She is already the mother of two children, but her life is like a tender sprout just emerging from the soil. Her strength is like the seawater of Bohai Bay, never running out. She has a cheerful, straightforward, and enthusiastic personality. Her voice is as loud and clear as the bell that rings every morning in the commune, perfectly in harmony with her personality and height. Not only is she strong, but she also works quickly and efficiently. She goes to the fields early every morning; people pull 10,000 sweet potato seedlings a day, and she pulls 13,000. Her work is not only plentiful but also of good quality. When shelling corn, she makes sure not a single grain is lost. When she goes back and forth from home to the fields, or when she delivers mud back and forth in the fields, she often carries a manure basket, picking up manure on the road whenever she sees it. After finishing her work, she often brings back a full basket of manure to the commune. Although she does so much work every day, she has never argued over work points when they are being assessed. When others give her a high evaluation, she always smiles and says, "Too much, too much." Last year, she worked two hundred and sixty labor days, and this year she plans to strive to exceed that.

    Sun Cuirong not only works well herself but also tries her best to help others. Yang Zi'ang's wife, a woman with bound feet, although only in her thirties, was not accustomed to participating in field labor. When the commune was busy transplanting rice seedlings, Sun Cuirong repeatedly persuaded her to go to the fields. When she first went to the fields, she was afraid to walk on the small ridges, so Sun Cuirong helped her walk; she didn't know how to transplant rice seedlings, so Sun Cuirong taught her. After three days, Yang Zi'ang's wife learned the skill of transplanting rice seedlings. There was an old woman in the commune who had to work from West Henan to East Henan during the spring plowing, but she was afraid to cross the Yang River, which was more than half a li wide and ran in between, so Sun Cuirong carried her back and forth across the Yang River three or four times a day. She carried her every day and never felt annoyed. In addition to helping the elderly, Sun Cuirong also helped children. When filling rice paddies, they formed teams to carry soil, and there was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child who participated in labor on Sundays, but some people were unwilling to carry a load with him, fearing that it would affect their earning fewer work points. Sun Cuirong took the initiative to propose to include the child in her team. She carried a load with him herself, trying to let the child have more of the carrying pole, letting the weight press more on her own shoulders. In the evening, when assessing work points, she proposed to give the child the same points as herself.

    Sun Cuirong is fair in handling affairs, has no selfishness, and is very concerned about others. Last year, in June and July, when there was a shortage of food, many commune members had no grain to eat and borrowed from the commune. When Sun Cuirong's husband saw others borrowing grain, he also asked the commune to borrow grain. Just as he was negotiating with the director of the commune, Sun Cuirong arrived, and without a second thought, she confronted her husband and said, "Isn't there still more than ten sheng of grain at home? We can manage for two days; if you borrow from the commune and he borrows from the commune, where will the commune get so much grain? If we don't borrow, we can let those who are more in need borrow more." Seeing her husband's embarrassed expression, she softened a bit and changed her tone: "I'll eat substitutes, and you eat grain, and we can manage." So, she only ate three large eggplants a day, but still worked as usual. At this time, a woman in her team was sick and had nothing to eat, so she borrowed six sheng of the only fifteen sheng of grain she had at home to that woman, and continued to eat substitutes herself.

    Sun Cuirong loves the commune and always thinks of the commune. Picking cotton is based on the weight to calculate work points. Picking slightly damp cotton can increase the weight. Sun Cuirong never picks damp cotton. If there is dew in the morning and the cotton is damp, she never picks cotton in the morning. She not only always takes care to cherish the commune's production tools herself, but she also doesn't hesitate to criticize others who don't care about the commune's property. Once, while carrying soil to fill rice paddies, a heavy rain suddenly began to fall. Some women, afraid of getting wet, ran home without regard for anything. While braving the rain to pick up the baskets, Sun Cuirong shouted loudly, "You only care about running home, don't you care about the commune's things?" This shout reminded everyone, and they quickly turned back and picked up the commune's soil baskets, carrying poles, shovels, and other items one by one to take home.

    Sun Cuirong takes the lead in responding to any call from the government and goes door-to-door to mobilize others. She takes the lead in responding to the surplus grain sale movement, the manure accumulation movement, and the support-the-army-and-cherish-the-families-of-soldiers movement. She often washes quilts and mends socks for the soldiers stationed nearby. No matter how busy she is, she takes time to mend and wash for the soldiers. While talking to people, she mends socks. She mends socks after socks. Two frames hang on her kang, one frame containing the labor model certificate issued to her by the county, and one frame filled with commemorative photos given to her by the soldiers. Whenever guests come, she shows the soldiers' photos to the guests, saying that these are her brothers.

    Such a vigorous, life-loving, collective-loving, and comrade-loving production expert, can you guess what her life was like in the past? Before liberation, she had been married to her husband for several years, but she didn't even dare to say a word to her husband. Before the organization in 1954, she didn't do much work in the fields, only doing needlework at home. But now, she has become a labor model!

    Her life only took root after liberation and blossomed and bore fruit after collectivization. (Image attached)

    一个好社员
    林元
    是半年以前的事了。正是最冷的三九天。在渤海边上，平坦无垠的田野上，大清早就充满了喧闹声。河北省抚宁县渤海农渔生产合作社的几千个男女社员，把沟堤上堆积得像万里长城一样的黑泥，用大车拉、人力抬，一车一车，一筐一筐，运送到四万五千多亩土地上去。
    几个男社员跟女社员比赛哪个赶车赶得好、赶得快，结果输给了女社员，一个小伙子有点儿老羞成怒，便想起了前些天在妇女当中刚刚批判过的跟男子比体力的办法，挑战说：“你们妇女啥都说中，谁敢跟我抬一付筐才算真中！”
    “我们妇女主任说过，不跟你们比力气！”一个高小毕业刚参加农业生产的姑娘大声说。
    “为啥？”
    “我们妇女有特殊情况！”
    “有啥特殊情况？”说着，小伙子向他的年轻伙伴做了个鬼脸，大伙便哄一声笑起来了。
    一个正在铲土装车的个子高大结实的妇女，把她的铁锹塞给旁边的伙伴，嗖一声从地上摸起一条扁担，亮着嗓子说：
    “来！我跟你抬！”
    双方估量了一下敌手，卷了卷袖子，便在大伙的喝采声中竞赛开了。一筐沉甸甸的泥土，搁在这个妇女的肩上，轻飘飘的就像一筐棉花。两个人飞快地来回抬着，一口气抬到了吃早饭的时间。吃完早饭，那个妇女再摸起扁担要跟那个小伙子抬的时候，小伙子却像个泄了气的皮球，满脸通红地说：
    “不中了，换个吧。”
    于是，女社员们爆发出一阵胜利的欢呼，有节拍地齐声嚷道：
    “孙——翠——荣——真——中！”
    孙翠荣是渤海社的劳动模范，脸孔圆圆的，留着两根短粗的辫子，今年三十一岁。她已经是两个孩子的妈妈了，可是，她的生命却像一棵刚冒出土来的嫩芽。她的力气，就像渤海湾的海水一样，永远用不完。她个性开朗，爽直，热情。她说话的声音像社里每天早晨敲起的钟声那样响亮清澈，跟她的性情和个子十分调和。她不但气力大，而且工作利落迅速。她每天一清早就下地；人家一天拔一万棵白薯秧，她拔一万三千棵。她的工作不但数量多，质量也好。劈包米，她做到了颗粒不掉。她从家里来回地头，或在地里来回送泥的当儿，常常背着个粪筐，看见路上有粪就拾。她干完活回家，常常给社里带回一筐满满的粪。她一天的工作虽然干得那么多，但在评分的时候却从没有争过工分。别人给多评，她总是笑笑说：“太多了，太多了。”她去年做了二百六十个劳动日，今年准备争取超过。
    孙翠荣不但自己劳动好，也尽力帮助别人劳动。社员杨子昂的妻子是个小脚妇女，虽然才三十多岁，可是平日没有参加田间劳动的习惯，社里插秧忙不过来，孙翠荣便再三去动员她下地。刚下地的时候，她不敢走小道埂，孙翠荣扶着她走；她不会插秧，孙翠荣教她插。经过了三天，杨子昂的妻子便学会了插秧的本领。社里有个老太太，在春耕的时候，要从西河南到东河南干活，可是她不敢过那条横在当中的半里多宽的洋河，孙翠荣就一天背她来回渡过洋河三四次。她天天背她，从不感到厌烦。除了帮助老人，孙翠荣也帮助孩子。填稻田地的时候，编组抬土，有个十五、六岁的孩子，在星期天参加劳动，可是有些人不愿跟他抬一付筐，怕影响自己少得工分。孙翠荣主动提出把孩子编到自己的组里来。她自个跟他抬一付筐，她尽量把扁担多让给孩子，让重量多压在自己的肩头上。晚上评分，她提出跟孩子评一样分。
    孙翠荣办事公道，没有私心，并且十分关心别人。去年六、七月间，青黄不接的时候，有很多社员没有粮食吃，纷纷向社里借。孙翠荣的丈夫看见别人借粮，也向社里提出借粮。正当他向社主任交涉的时候，孙翠荣赶来了，她不管三七二十一就冲着丈夫说：“家里不是还有十多升粮？咱们能吃两天就对付两天；要是你也向社借，他也向社借，社里哪来这许多粮？咱们不借，就可以让比咱们更困难的人多借一些。”她看见丈夫那个为难的样子，心里有点软下来，便换了个口气：“我吃代食品，你吃粮食，就可以对付得过去了。”于是，她一天只吃三个大茄子，活仍然照样干。正在这个时候，他队里有个妇女有病，没有吃的，她便把家里仅有的十五升粮食，借了六升给那个妇女，自己继续吃代食品。
    孙翠荣爱社，处处为社着想。捡棉花是根据重量计算工分的，捡潮一点的棉花，重量可以大些。孙翠荣从来不捡潮的。午前有露水，棉花带潮，她就从来不在午前捡棉花。她不但自己使用社的生产工具经常当心爱惜，对别人不关心社的财产，她也毫不客气地提出批评。一次，正在抬土填稻田地，突然下起暴雨来。有些妇女怕被浇湿了，不顾一切地往家里跑。孙翠荣一面冒雨拾着筐子，一面大声喊着：“你们光顾自己往家里跑，不管社里的东西还中？”这一喊，把人们提醒了，大伙便飞快地转回头来把社里的土筐、扁担、铁锹等物一样样捡齐带回家去。
    政府的任何号召，孙翠荣都带头响应，并挨家挨户动员别人。卖余粮运动、积肥运动、拥军优属运动，她都带头响应。她经常给驻防在附近的部队战士拆洗被窝、缝补袜子。不管多忙，她都要抽出空儿来给战士们补补洗洗。跟人说话的时候，她一面说一面补袜子。袜子补了一双又一双。她的炕头上挂着两个镜框，一个镜框里装着县里发给她的劳动模范奖状，一个镜框里装满着战士们赠送给她的纪念照片。一有客人来，她就拿战士们的照片给客人看，说这些都是她的兄弟。
    这样一个生气勃勃、热爱生活、热爱集体、热爱同志的生产能手，你猜她过去的生活是怎么样的？在解放以前，她跟丈夫结婚了几年，可是连话都不敢跟丈夫多说一句。1954年组织起来以前，她还不怎么下地干活，只在家里做做针线。而现在，却成了劳动模范！
    她的生命在解放后才扎下根，在合作化以后才开花结果。（附图片）
