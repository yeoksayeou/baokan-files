On the southern slopes of the majestic Balkan Mountains, north of the verdant Sredna Gora Mountains, extending eastward from Rosino across a valley over a hundred kilometers long, roses and various fruits flourish. Roses transplanted from the East centuries ago have found soil and climate conditions particularly favorable for their growth here. The "Kazanlak Oil Rose," named after Kazanlak, the largest city in the Rose Valley, is a specialty of Bulgaria. This rose is renowned worldwide for its high oil content. Its blossoms are red and white. The rose oil extracted from its petals is a precious raw material for making perfumes and pharmaceuticals. Bulgarian rose oil has long been famous on the international market, enjoying a high reputation for its purity and quality.

During the fascist monarchy, Bulgaria's rose production declined due to deliberate sabotage. After liberation, the people's government took measures to restore and expand rose production. Cooperative rose plantations gradually replaced private rose gardens, creating conditions for the development of rose production. The acreage under roses is constantly expanding, and by the beginning of 1957, it will be twice that of 1953. The rose product processing industry has also developed, with new rose oil distilleries appearing. The state exports large quantities of rose oil every year to earn foreign exchange, which serves as a source of funds for socialist construction.

Rose oil is a yellow or yellow-green liquid. This precious liquid is the result of hard work. Approximately two tons of rose flowers are needed to extract one kilogram of rose oil, and each person can only pick forty to fifty kilograms of rose flowers in one morning. Rose picking always takes place before dawn, because the more dew on the petals, the higher the oil yield. The girls who pick roses get up earlier than the most enthusiastic tourists. In May and June, when the roses are in full bloom, at the break of dawn, you can see brightly dressed girls like swarms of butterflies flitting across the rose bushes. Amidst the rustling sound of nimble fingers picking rose petals, melodious songs occasionally drift by, singing of the tranquility, fragrance, and beauty of the valley.

The magnificent scenery of the Rose Valley attracts tens of thousands of tourists every year. From the peaks of the Balkan Mountains, overlooking this narrow valley, one sees a harmonious picture woven from rose bushes, fields, orchards, and meadows. The faint outlines of the Sredna Gora Mountains across the way add to its charm.

The Tundzha River and the Stryama River flow through the entire valley. The rose gardens, apple orchards, and vineyards on both banks of the river exude a rich fragrance. The towering cliffs of the Balkan Mountains block the cold winds blowing from the north, and the hot winds from the south dissipate in the beech and oak forests on the Sredna Gora Mountains, making the climate of the valley warm and pleasant. In May and June, there is a drizzle here. Delicate flowers adorned with sparkling dewdrops sway gently in the breeze. Countless mountain streams flow into the Dimitrov Reservoir, rippling the calm surface of this artificial lake. Everywhere, boundless tranquility brings joy to the heart.

Visitors to the Rose Valley can not only enjoy its unique fragrance and color but also see many historical monuments. Vazovgrad (formerly Sopot) is the hometown of the great Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov, and Levskigrad (formerly Karlovo) is the birthplace of the outstanding Bulgarian democratic revolutionary Vasil Levski. Throughout the valley, one can encounter such villages whose names evoke the glorious April Uprising in the Sredna Gora Mountains, recalling the heroic sons and daughters who sacrificed their lives to liberate Bulgaria from the Turkish "yoke."

"Rose trees in the valley, blessings and reverence in the chest," wrote Vazov when praising his beautiful motherland. Bulgarians call the Rose Valley the pearl of Bulgaria. This pearl shines even more attractively in the era of the people's government. (Mi) (Attached picture)

    保加利亚的玫瑰谷
    在雄伟壮丽的巴尔干山南麓，在林木青葱的斯列德那山北面，从罗西诺往东，在绵长一百多公里的谷地上，盛产玫瑰和各种水果。几百年前从东方移植来的玫瑰，在这里找到了对它生长特别有利的土壤和气候条件。由玫瑰谷最大的城市卡占雷克得名的“卡占雷克油玫瑰”，是保加利亚的特产。这种玫瑰以含油量高著称于世。它的花朵有红白两色。从花瓣提炼出来的玫瑰油，是制造香水和药剂的珍贵原料。保加利亚的玫瑰油久已驰名国际市场，它的纯度和质量享有很高的声誉。
    在法西斯保皇政权期间，保加利亚玫瑰的产量曾因人为的破坏而下降。解放后，人民政权采取了恢复并扩大玫瑰产量的措施。合作化的玫瑰种植场逐步代替了私人的玫瑰园，为发展玫瑰的生产创造了条件。玫瑰的种植面积在不断扩大，到1957年初，将达到1953年的两倍。玫瑰产品加工业也有了发展，新的玫瑰油酿制所出现了。国家每年输出大量的玫瑰油换取外汇，作为社会主义建设资金的一个来源。
    玫瑰油是黄色或黄绿色的液体。这种珍贵的液体是辛勤劳动的结晶。大约两吨玫瑰花才能提炼出一公斤玫瑰油，而每人一个早晨只能采摘四、五十公斤玫瑰花。采摘玫瑰花总是在黎明之前，因为花瓣上的露水越多，它的出油率也就越高。采摘玫瑰的姑娘们比最热心的游客起得还早。五、六月间，当玫瑰花盛开的时节，天蒙蒙亮，就会看见服饰鲜艳的姑娘们像一群群蝴蝶掠过玫瑰花丛。在灵巧的手指采摘玫瑰花瓣的沙沙声中，时而飘来悠扬的歌声，歌唱着山谷的恬静、芳香和美丽。
    玫瑰谷的珣丽景色每年都把成千上万的游人吸引到这里来。从巴尔干山的峰顶俯瞰这狭长的谷地，就会看到一幅由玫瑰花丛、田野、果园和草地织成的色彩和谐的图画。对面斯列德那山的淡淡的轮廓，给它平添了不少妩媚。
    登萨河和斯特列玛河流贯整个谷地。河两岸的玫瑰园、苹果园、葡萄园……，散发着浓郁的香气。巍峨的巴尔干山脉的峭壁挡住了北面吹来的冷风，南来的热风消失在斯列德那山上的山毛榉林和檞树林里，使谷地的气候温暖宜人。五、六月间，这里下着蒙蒙细雨。娇艳的花朵缀着晶莹的露珠，在微风中轻轻摇曳。山间无数溪流注入季米特洛夫水库，使这个人工湖的平静的水面泛起了涟漪。到处，无边的宁静令人心旷神怡。
    玫瑰谷的游客不但可以享受这里独特的香和色，还能看到许多历史纪念物。伐佐夫格勒（原名索波特）是保加利亚伟大作家伊凡·伐佐夫的故乡，列夫斯基格勒（原名卡尔洛沃）是保加利亚杰出的民主革命家瓦西里·列夫斯基的诞生地。在整个谷地，到处都能遇到这样的村庄，它们的名字使人想起斯列德那山的光荣的四月起义，想起那些为争取保加利亚从土耳其“轭下”解放出来而献出生命的英雄儿女。
    “玫瑰树在山谷，祝福和虔敬在胸膛”，这是伐佐夫在歌颂他美丽的祖国时写下的诗句。保加利亚人把玫瑰谷称作保加利亚的珍珠。这粒珍珠在人民政权年代里发出了更加诱人的光彩。　（麋）（附图片）
