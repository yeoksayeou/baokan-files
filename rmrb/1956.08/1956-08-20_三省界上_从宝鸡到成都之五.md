    At the Tri-Provincial Border
    ——From Baoji to Chengdu, Part Five
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
    In the area bordering Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, as the train speeds south, towns and villages constantly flash by. On this ancient battlefield, once known for its "mountains of bones and rivers of corpses," with the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the once desolate landscape is now filled with construction sheds, new houses are being built everywhere, smoking factories are nestled at the foot of the mountains, bustling markets have sprung up along the newly built roads, and white tents bloom like flowers on the riverbanks. Along the way, you can often see large groups of farmers, women, children, and girls standing in pomegranate-shaded mountain villages, beaming with smiles as they greet the train with cheers and applause!
    New Scenes in Ancient Fengzhou
    This is the ancient Fengzhou in southern Shaanxi. Next to the desolate and collapsing ancient city, large numbers of warehouses and depots are being built. The busy freight station is piled high with grain, cotton, general merchandise, and oil drums from north and south. Although all kinds of equipment are not yet complete, more than 20,000 tons of goods have been shipped from here since May. After the twelve new tracks are laid, this will become the largest station yard between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang planned his campaign against Wei at the "Deliberation Platform," Tang Monk passed through the Yellow Peak Cave on his journey to obtain scriptures, and Taoist Zhang Guolao lived in seclusion and played chess in the nearby hills.
    The Shuangshipu, facing each other across the mountains, is not only the throat of the highway connecting Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, but also the most prosperous town along the railway line. The Feng County People's Committee is located here. In the town, which is home to more than four thousand residents, hundreds of vehicles loaded with passengers and goods shuttle back and forth day and night. Large and small hotels, teahouses, and restaurants are crowded with travelers. The long whistle of the train brings a new atmosphere to the ancient mountain town. Rows of new houses are being built on the hillside, and new station buildings are being built at the foot of the mountain. Although this is not, as some people mistakenly believe, the place where Shu general Ma Su lost Jieting (note: according to Guanzhong Shengzhi, the Jieting lost by Ma Su is located fifteen miles west of Chenggu County, Hanzhong), the situation is very dangerous. The Phoenix Mountain, which stands at the confluence of the Jialing River and the Xiaoyu River, and the continuous mountains along the river are indeed important places for military strategists to compete for in ancient and modern times. Legend has it that Emperor Gaozu of Han went south to take Hanzhong and north to attack Xijing, and Zhuge Liang made wooden oxen and flowing horses to transport grain during his six expeditions to Qishan, all passing through this place. In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army entered Sichuan, they also wiped out more than 20,000 enemy troops in this area.
    Feng County is rich in precious medicinal materials such as codonopsis pilosula and cassia bark, as well as various mountain fruits such as walnuts, Chinese prickly ash, and Longkou pears. Walnuts alone produce 300,000 catties a year. 70% of the county's area is forest and barren hills, with rich cork oak resources, which has a huge impact on the production of China's cork industry and the supply of cork products. However, in the past, many trees and local products could not be transported out, resulting in large-scale mold and reduced production, and people's lives were very difficult. This situation has fundamentally changed after the construction of the road. Comrade Cheng Xueyao, the head of Feng County, said:
    "In the past, 70% to 80% of the families in the rural areas here did not have quilts. Most people slept on corn husks and ate cornmeal. But now, look! The farmers not only eat rice and salt, but every household has new quilts, bed sheets, thermos bottles, and enamel basins. Many families have also built new cave dwellings and tile houses. After the road was built, every grass and tree is valuable, and the income of farmers has greatly increased. In the past year alone, the income of farmers from selling firewood and timber through the government has increased by more than 300,000 yuan. The purchasing power of farmers has also greatly increased. For example, the turnover of the Fengzhou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative has increased tenfold in three years, from only more than 50,000 yuan in 1953 to more than 240,000 yuan in 1955, and it is expected to reach about 500,000 yuan in 1956!"
    Joy in the Deep Mountains
    Crossing a mountain south from Feng County is Liangdang County and Huixian County in Gansu.
    As travelers travel here, what unfolds before their eyes are all majestic and beautiful Huaguo Mountains. Ripe loquats, bright red pomegranate flowers, and apricots, plums, and walnuts hanging heavily from the branches are intertwined and covering the surrounding hundreds of miles of mountains and fields. The mountains are rich in coal and iron. In addition, there are more than 100 kinds of famous and precious medicinal materials such as codonopsis pilosula, atractylodes lancea, radix rehmanniae, and bear paws.
    However, in these beautiful mountains and rivers, diseases severely torment the people. The folk saying "One generation grows, the second generation is stupid, and the third generation is uprooted" vividly reflects the pain that diseases bring to the local people. Along the way, you can see people with thick necks, lame legs, and swollen knees. In Liangdang County, deep in the mountains, under the reactionary rule of past dynasties, farmers suffered greatly from leprosy, dwarfism, goiter, venereal diseases, and large joint diseases due to lack of salt and kelp and lack of medicine, resulting in a sharp decline in population. Now almost all of the county's 30,000 residents are immigrants from other provinces. After liberation, in order to eradicate these diseases, the people's government, in addition to establishing hospitals and leprosy hospitals and providing a large number of free medicines, also transported large quantities of kelp and salt from far away to supply the farmers. In the past, one dou of grain could only be exchanged for two jin of salt, but now it can be exchanged for forty jin. Kelp, which had never been seen before, is also continuously transported to the mountainous areas with the construction of the railway. In the past, leprosy patients only had one way to die. Now, the state not only provides free treatment, but also subsidizes each isolated patient with ten yuan per month. According to Mr. Qi Kongyan, the deputy director of the county health center who is over sixty years old, the number of patients with venereal diseases among the residents has been greatly reduced, and goiter has gradually been eradicated among young people under the age of twenty. The number of newborn babies is also increasing day by day. The reduction of diseases and the increase of population are the most joyful things for the people of the whole county.
    When the train arrived at the "North-South Rail Connection Point of Baoji-Chengdu Railway" in Huangsha River, Huixian County, dozens of miles of surrounding farmers ran to welcome the train with gongs and drums and flags. The joyful and uplifting mood, the smiling faces, sincerely expressed the people's feelings for the "Road to Happiness." This is because the railway brings more beautiful hopes and happiness to the people in the mountainous areas. The members of the No. 2 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tanjiazhuang are preparing to build more than a dozen warehouses near the station in order to facilitate the transportation of their grain and local products by train. With the help of railway workers, they have not only opened night schools, but also established libraries and clubs. All the more than 30 households in the village who lacked food and clothing now have surplus grain, mosquito nets, and two or three sets of clothes. An old man named Zhao Lianli, who had little food and clothing before liberation, and whose couple often wore a pair of pants in turn all year round, now has everything he needs at home, has savings in the bank, and has also bought 500 yuan of public bonds. He said, "My life is getting better and better."
    A Thriving Town
    Yangpingguan, the gateway to Sichuan and Shaanxi, is flanked by majestic mountains, and the turbulent Jialing River flows in the middle. This has been a famous military stronghold since ancient times; to go west to Sichuan, you must cross Jianmen Pass, and to go north to Gansu, you must pass through the dangerous Yinping Ancient Road. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang relied on the dangerous terrain here to send Zhao Zilong to lead thousands of troops to guard the pass and defeat Cao Cao's army of 100,000. Under Zilong Mountain on the south bank of the river, a wide station yard has now been built.
    In the Yaochangba Village where the station is located, more than 20 of the 50 or so farmer households have built new houses in recent years. Since the railway began temporary business, it has become a hub for the transshipment of goods between Sichuan and Shaanxi, with more than 2,000 passengers getting on and off and hundreds of tons of goods being transported every day. When we arrived, there were still more than 1,000 tons of goods waiting to be transported on the platform. Many units are rushing to build warehouses here. On the other side of the river, the ancient and remote town of Yangping has also become younger after the opening of the railway. There is a highway here that connects to the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, and there are also many wooden boats traveling between Lueyang and Guangyuan, and the freight is quite busy. In the small town of more than 300 households, travelers often crowd the streets, and the turnover of various commercial institutions in the town accounts for more than half of the total turnover of Ningqiang County. The 100,000 jin of wood ears produced here used to be exchanged for only two chi of cloth per jin, but now the state purchases them in large quantities, and each jin of wood ears can be exchanged for six or seven chi of cloth. The county's famous local products, such as walnuts, tung oil, peanuts, and medicinal materials, are also transshipped here to other places.
    Machiaoba in Sichuan, which could not be found on any large or small maps in the past and had only more than 100 broken houses, has now become a rising city. The tents in the early days of road construction have been transformed into tile houses and buildings. Banks, department stores, bookstores, and supply and marketing cooperatives have offices here; in addition, there are post and telecommunications bureaus, photography studios, and Chinese and Western medical clinics. At the station, the tall station building is surrounded by local products and grain waiting to be transported. The Jiangyou Iron Mine near Machiaoba has also been expanded. A 5.5-ton hot blast stove has replaced the earthen stove that used to produce only more than 1,000 jin of molten iron per day. The newly built power station also illuminates the valley and the city all night. Looking at all these wonderful changes, who can not be happy for this thriving scene! (Attached picture)

    三省界上
    ——从宝鸡到成都之五
    本报记者　纪希晨
    在陕，甘，川三省的交界地带，从奔向南去的列车上望出去，随时都有市镇、村庄在眼前掠过。在这曾是“白骨堆山，?积江岸”的古战场上，随着宝成铁路的修筑，昔日一片荒凉的地方，如今到处林立着工棚，盖起了新房，山脚下盘绕着冒烟的工厂，新修的马路边出现了繁荣的市场，白色的帐篷像鲜花一样开放在河岸上。沿路常常可以看到一大群农民、妇女、孩子和姑娘，站在石榴花掩映的山庄里，笑逐颜开地迎着火车，欢呼，鼓掌！
    古凤州的新景象
    这儿是陕南的古凤州。荒芜倒塌的古城旁，正修建着大批的仓库和栈房。货运繁忙的车站上，堆满着南来北往的粮食，棉花、百货和油桶。虽然各样设备还都没有齐全，可是，这儿五月份以来已发运出两万多吨货物。十二条新股道铺好后，这儿将成为秦岭巴山间一个最大的站场。相传昔日诸葛亮在此筹策伐魏的“思计台”，唐僧取经路过的黄峰洞，道人张果老隐居奕棋的地方，都在附近的山岗上。
    群山对峙的双石铺，不仅是陕西、甘肃、四川三省公路的咽喉，而且还是铁路沿线最繁荣的一个市镇，凤县人民委员会就设在这里。居住着四千多居民的街镇上，日夜穿梭着几百辆满载旅客和货物的车辆。大小旅馆，茶馆，饭店都拥满了往来的旅客。火车的长鸣更给古老的山镇带来了新气象。山坡上修起一排排新房，山脚下兴建起新的站房。这儿虽然不是如人们误传的是蜀将马谡失守街亭的地方（注：据关中胜志载；马谡失守的街亭，在汉中城固县西十五里），但是形势却十分险要。屹立在嘉陵江、小峪河会合口上的凤凰山，和沿江一带连绵不断的峻岭，确是古今兵家争夺的重地。相传汉高祖南下取汉中，北上攻西京，诸葛亮六出祁山，创制木牛流马运粮，都曾经过这个地方。1949年人民解放军入川时，还在这一带消灭敌军两万多人。
    凤县盛产党参、桂皮等贵重药材，和核桃、花椒、龙口梨等各样山果，单核桃一年即产三十万斤。全县70％的面积都是丛林和荒山，蕴藏丰富的栓皮栎，对于我国的软木工业的生产和软木制品的供应更有巨大的作用。可是，过去许多林木，土特产都因运不出去，大批霉烂减产，人民生活十分困难。这种情况，筑路后已有了根本的改变。凤县县长成学尧同志说：
    “从前，这里农村十之七八的人家没有被子，多数人都是睡的包谷叶，吃的包谷珍子。可是，现在你看看吧！农民们不光吃上了大米、盐巴，家家户户都有了新被子、床单子、暖水瓶、搪瓷盆，许多人家还新修了窑洞、瓦屋。筑路以后，一草一木都值钱了，农民收入大大增加。一年来，单是农民经过政府卖的柴草木料，就增加了三十多万元的收入。农民购买力也大大提高了，例如凤州乡供销社的营业额，三年就上升了十倍，1953年只有五万多元，1955年就上升到二十四万多元，1956年预计要达到五十万元左右！”
    深山里的喜悦
    从凤县向南翻过一架山，就是甘肃的两当县和徽县。
    旅客们在这儿旅行，展现在眼前的全是巍峨秀丽的花果山。黄熟的枇杷，红艳艳的石榴花，累累垂枝的杏李核桃，交相掩复着周围百余里的山野。山上蕴藏有丰富的煤、铁。此外，党参、苍术、生地、熊掌等著名的珍贵药材就有一百多种。
    可是，在这美丽的山川里，疾病却严重地折磨着人民。民间流传的“一辈长，二辈傻，三辈连根拔”的话，真切地反映了疾病给当地人民带来的痛苦。沿途都可以看到一些粗脖子、拐腿和膝盖肿胀的人。深山中的两当县，解放前，在历代反动统治下，因为吃不到盐巴，海带，缺乏医药，农民十分之七、八都流行着麻疯病、侏儒病、甲状腺肿大病、花柳病和大关节病，以致人口锐减。现在全县三万居民几乎全是外省移民。解放后，为着扑灭这些疾病，人民政府除建立卫生院、麻疯病院，免费大量供应药品外，还从远地运来大批海带、食盐供应农民。过去一斗粮食只能换二斤盐，如今能换到四十斤。从来见不到的海带，随着铁路的修筑也源源运到山区来。过去麻疯病患者只有死路一条，如今，国家除给免费治疗，还给隔离开的病人每人每月补助十元钱。据六十多岁的县卫生院副院长齐孔严先生谈：现在居民中，花柳病的患者已经大大减少，二十岁以下的青年人已经逐渐根绝了甲状腺肿大病。新生的婴儿也日益增多了。疾病减少、人口增多，这是全县人民最喜悦的事情。
    当火车开到徽县黄沙河南“宝成铁路南北接轨点”的时候，周围几十里的农民都打着锣鼓，拿着旗帜，跑来欢迎火车。那欢乐昂扬的情绪，那喜笑颜开的脸孔，真挚的表达了人民对“幸福之路”的感情。这是因为铁路给山区人民带来了更美好的希望和幸福。谈家庄第二农业生产合作社的社员们，为着便于火车运出他们的粮食和土特产，正准备动手在车站附近修筑十多间库房。他们在铁路工人帮助下，不仅开办了夜校，还建立了图书馆、俱乐部。全村三十多户缺吃、少穿的社员，现在家家全都有了余粮、蚊帐和两三套衣裳。一个叫做赵连理的老人，解放前少吃没穿，夫妇俩常年轮穿一条裤子，现在家中不光衣被用具样样俱全，不光在银行里有了存款，还买了五百元的公债，他说：“我的日子一天比一天好过了。”
    欣欣向荣的市镇
    川陕门户阳平关，两边是巍峨的高山，中间是波涛滚滚的嘉陵江。这里自古就是有名的军事重地；西到四川要翻过剑门关，北到甘肃要经过险要的阴平古道。相传诸葛亮就是凭借这里形势险要，派赵子龙率领几千人马守关，打退了曹操的十万大军的。江南岸的子龙山下，现在已兴修起了宽大的站场。
    车站所在的窑场坝村，五十多户农民中近年来有二十多户都盖起了新房。自从铁路开办临时营业以来，这里已变成为川陕货物转运的枢纽，每天都上下两千多旅客，起运几百吨货物。我们到达的时候，站台上还堆着一千多吨待运的货物。不少单位都在这里赶建货仓。江对岸，古老偏僻的阳平镇，通车后也变得更加年青了。这里有公路和川陕公路相接，同时还有不少木船往来略阳和广元之间，货运相当繁忙。三百多户的小镇上，旅客经常把行道拥得水泄不通，市镇内的各种商业机构，营业额竟达宁强全县营业总额的一半以上。这里出产的十万斤木耳，过去一斤只能换两尺市布，现在国家大量收购，每斤木耳可换市布六、七尺。全县著名的土特产核桃、桐油、花生、药材等，也都经过这里转运到其他地方去。
    过去大小地图上都找不到的四川马角坝，只有一百多间破房子，现在已成为一座新兴的城市。筑路初期的帐篷，变成了瓦屋和楼房。银行、百货公司、书店、供销社等都在这里设有办事处；此外，还有邮电局，摄影社和中西医诊疗所。车站上，高大的站房周围堆满了待运的土特产和粮食。马角坝附近的江油铁矿，如今也有了扩大，五吨半的热风炉，代替了每天只出一千多斤铁水的土炉子。新修的发电站，也通夜照亮着山谷和城市。望着这一切奇妙的变化，谁能不为这欣欣向荣的景象而高兴呢！（附图片）
