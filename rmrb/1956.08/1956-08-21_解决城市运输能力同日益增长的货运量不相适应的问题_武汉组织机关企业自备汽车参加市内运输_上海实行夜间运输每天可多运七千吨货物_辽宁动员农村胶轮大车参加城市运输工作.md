To solve the problem of urban transport capacity not adapting to the increasing freight volume:
Wuhan organizes agencies and enterprises to use their own vehicles to participate in urban transport
Shanghai implements night transport, which can transport an additional 7,000 tons of goods per day
Liaoning mobilizes rural rubber-tired carts to participate in urban transport work
(Reported by this newspaper) Recently, many agencies and enterprises in Wuhan have participated in urban transport work with their own vehicles. This was organized by the Wuhan City Transport General Dispatch Office in accordance with the interim transport management measures issued by the Municipal People's Committee.
According to the interim transport management measures of Wuhan, in order to meet the needs of urban transport and improve the efficiency of vehicle use, the Transportation Bureau can reasonably schedule and adjust the self-provided vehicles of agencies and enterprises according to the urgency of the transport task, without hindering the business of the agencies and enterprises themselves. The Wuhan City Transport General Dispatch Office began preparations in July. They surveyed 134 agencies and enterprises and found that 101 vehicles could be utilized. It is initially estimated that these 101 vehicles can help the transportation department complete about 50,000 tons of freight tasks per month. In early August, some agencies and enterprises began to organize their vehicles to participate in transportation. On the 8th, a unit of the Transportation Department of the Zhongnan Engineering Management Bureau transported 1,571 tons of goods in Wuchang. Many other units will also sign contracts in different ways and be organized to undertake the increasingly heavy urban transportation tasks. (Changjiang Daily)

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, Electric Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Shoukeng reports: In Shanghai, a serious mismatch has emerged between the capacity of urban freight transport and the ever-increasing volume of freight. Relevant departments are taking measures to change this situation.

In the past, Shanghai's urban transport capacity had always been more than sufficient. Since the second quarter of this year, freight volume has increased sharply, with transported goods more than doubling compared to the same period last year. Despite the full deployment of all large and small trucks and manual carts, "tiger carts," and wheelbarrows in the city, a large number of goods still cannot be transported every day. Due to transportation disruptions, some factories have suspended operations awaiting materials; some export goods awaiting shipment cannot be transported to the docks; and goods supplied to various regions cannot be transported to the stations on time. Some small factories are unable to ship their products, and even all workers are suspended from work to deliver goods.

Poor scheduling of vehicles by the transportation department and poor coordination of transportation by consigning units have wasted some transport capacity and aggravated this mismatch.

In response to this situation, Shanghai's urban transport departments are taking measures to tap potential and appropriately increase equipment to solve this problem. Currently, urban night transport has been opened, with more than 300 large trucks running all night between factories, warehouses, docks, and railway stations, transporting more than 7,000 tons of goods every night. Five hundred new truck drivers are learning driving skills in preparation for participating in night transport. The local industrial department has designated nine parts manufacturing factories to specialize in manufacturing freight car parts for the transportation department. Vehicle maintenance yards have also increased night shifts to strengthen vehicle maintenance and repair. New telephone lines have been added between the dispatch department and various parking lots to centrally dispatch vehicles of public-private joint transportation companies. In addition, many factories, enterprises, and other consigning units have also begun to widen freight yards and driveways, simplify procedures for vehicles entering and exiting warehouses, and extend the time for receiving and dispatching goods in order to accelerate vehicle turnover. Some units have also set up lighting equipment to adapt to the needs of night transport. According to personnel in the urban transport department, it is expected that by the fourth quarter of this year, the city's daily freight capacity can be increased by more than 15,000 tons compared to the present, and the mismatch between transport capacity and transport volume can be basically improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: The 8,900+ rural rubber-wheeled carts supporting the cities recently transported millions of tons of goods accumulated at railway stations and warehouses in various cities in Liaoning Province to the locations where they were needed, playing a significant role in urban transportation. This batch of carts has returned to the countryside in succession to participate in rural production.

This year, the volume of freight transport in various cities in Liaoning Province increased by 12% compared to last year, but the number of transport vehicles decreased compared to last year. A large number of construction materials, industrial products, grain, coal, and other goods were accumulated in railway stations and warehouses in Fushun, Liaoyang, Jinzhou, and Shenyang, and there were no vehicles to transport them to the locations where they were needed. Although many construction sites have started construction one after another, construction materials cannot be transported to the sites on schedule, causing work stoppages waiting for materials.

On May 31st, the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee issued instructions to the people's committees of various cities and counties, and instructed the transportation department to send ten working groups to various places to mobilize rural vehicles during the agricultural slack season to support urban transportation.

Agricultural production cooperatives in various places have reasonably arranged their own transportation work and spared vehicles to support urban transportation. Agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Fuxin City and Fuxin County dispatched 330 rubber-tired carts, transported the goods accumulated in Fuxin City to the locations where they were needed, and then returned to the countryside. This not only did not affect rural transportation, but also increased sideline income for the agricultural cooperatives.

    解决城市运输能力同日益增长的货运量不相适应的问题
    武汉组织机关企业自备汽车参加市内运输
    上海实行夜间运输每天可多运七千吨货物
    辽宁动员农村胶轮大车参加城市运输工作
    本报讯　近来，武汉市许多机关企业的自备汽车，参加了市内运输工作。这是武汉市运输总调度室依照市人民委员会发布的运输管理暂行办法组织的。
    按照武汉市运输管理暂行办法，为满足市内运输需要，提高汽车的使用效率，在不妨碍机关企业本身业务的情况下，交通运输局可以根据运输任务缓急，合理调度调剂机关企业的自备车辆。武汉市运输总调度室在七月份就开始进行准备工作，他们调查了一百三十四个机关企业单位，发现有一百零一辆汽车可以利用，初步估计，这一百零一辆汽车，每月可以帮助运输部门完成五万吨左右的货运任务。八月初就有一部分机关企业单位的汽车被组织起来参加运输。八日那天，中南工程管理总局运输处一个单位就在武昌运了一千五百七十一吨货物。其他许多单位也将按不同方式签订合同，陆续组织起来，担负日益繁重的市内运输任务。　（长江日报）
    新华社上海电　新华社记者徐寿铿报道：上海的市内货物运输能力和日益增长的货运量之间，出现严重不相适应的现象。有关部门正采取措施改变这个局面。
    过去，上海的市内运输能力一直是有余的。今年第二季度以来，货运量骤然增长，运输的货物超过了去年同期一倍以上。尽管全市大小卡车和人力的拖塌车、老虎车、独轮车全部出动，每天还有大批货物来不及运输。由于运输脱节，有的工厂停工待料；有些等待出口的物资不能运到码头；供应各地的商品也不能按时运到车站。有些小型工厂产品运不出去，甚至全部工人停工送货。
    运输部门调度车辆不善，托运单位配合运输不好，浪费了部分运力，也加重了这种不相适应的局面。
    上海的市内运输部门针对这种情况，采取挖掘潜力和适当增加设备的办法来解决这一问题。目前，市内夜间运输已经开放，三百多辆大卡车通宵在工厂、仓库、码头和火车站之间行驶，每个晚上运输七千吨以上的货物。五百名新的卡车司机正在学习驾驶技术，准备参加夜间运输。地方工业部门已经划出九个零件制造厂，专门为运输部门制造货车零件。车辆保养场也增加了夜班作业，加强车辆的养护和检修。调度部门和各个停车场间增设了新的电话线，集中调度公私合营运输公司的车辆。此外，许多工厂、企业等托运单位也已经开始拓宽货场和行车道，简化车辆进出仓库的手续，延长收发货物时间，以加速车辆周转。有的单位还设置了照明设备，适应夜间运输的需要。据市内运输部门人员谈，预计到今年第四季度，市内每天的货运能力可比现在提高一万五千吨以上，运力和运量不相适应的局面可以基本上得到改善。
    新华社沈阳19日电　支援城市的八千九百多辆农村胶轮大车，最近把积压在辽宁省各城市火车站和仓库的几百万吨货物运到需要地点，对城市运输起了极大的作用。这批大车已经陆续回乡，参加农村生产。
    今年辽宁省各城市货物运输量比去年增加12％，但是运输车辆比去年减少了。抚顺、辽阳、锦州和沈阳等城市的火车站和仓库里积压着大批建筑材料、工业产品、粮食、煤炭等货物，没有车辆运到需要地点。许多建筑工地虽然陆续开工了，而建筑材料却不能按期运到工地，造成停工待料。
    辽宁省人民委员会在五月三十一日向各市、县人民委员会发出指示，并且责成运输部门派出十个工作组，深入各地动员农村车辆，利用农闲时间，支援城市运输。
    各地农业生产合作社曾经合理地安排了自己的运输工作，抽出车辆支援城市运输。阜新市郊区和阜新县的农业生产合作社，抽调了三百三十辆胶轮大车，把阜新市积压的货物运到需要地点以后回到农村，不仅没有影响农村运输，而且使农业社增加了副业收入。
