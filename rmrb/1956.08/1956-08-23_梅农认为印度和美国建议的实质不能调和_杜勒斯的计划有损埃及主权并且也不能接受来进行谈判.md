Xinhua News Agency, London, August 22nd: Menon, the chief Indian representative at the London conference, stated at a press conference on August 21st that the substance of the Indian and American proposals is irreconcilable. Comparing the two proposals, he said the Indian proposal laid down "a carpet on which the West and Egypt can walk to meet," while the American proposal "takes us back to where we started."

Menon emphasized: "The purpose of the London conference is not to obtain a majority vote. Ultimatum cannot achieve a solution." The conference cannot force Egypt to accept the "internationalization" of the canal as a "command." He reiterated that the entire purpose of the London conference is to lead to negotiations. He said: "Unless we are willing to go to war, we must try to hold negotiations."

Menon continued that the purpose of the Indian proposal is to bring Egypt and the West together for negotiations. The Indian plan requires the West to give up its position, but its purpose is to guide the conference towards negotiations. With direct contact, other issues can then be resolved.

Menon criticized the American proposal, saying that its substance is incompatible with Egyptian sovereignty. Dulles's proposal to replace the existing Suez Canal Authority with an international management bureau is unacceptable to Egypt.

Menon summarized the situation by saying: "Dulles' proposal is unacceptable for negotiations, but our plan is acceptable for negotiations." He also said: "It is not a question of the degree of divergence between Dulles' proposal and ours. They are two different approaches."

Menon pointed out that only Egypt can guarantee the freedom of navigation on the canal. He said: "If any country attempts to assume responsibility for navigation, that country is Egypt itself."

A reporter asked what kind of power the advisory committee proposed by Menon would have. He replied: "The power to exert influence. It will not exercise any coercive power." He added: "The only other way to exercise power is war."

Someone also asked what he would do if a vote were to be taken at the London conference. Menon replied: "There is no question of voting. It is not up to us to accept or reject." He also pointed out that the London conference was not convened on the basis of universal participation by countries related to the canal, "If the Egyptians do not attend, voting will not achieve anything."

    梅农认为印度和美国建议的实质不能调和
    杜勒斯的计划有损埃及主权并且也不能接受来进行谈判
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：印度出席伦敦会议首席代表梅农八月二十一日在记者招待会上表示，印度建议和美国建议的实质是不能够调和的。他比较这两个建议说，印度的建议铺下了“一条地毯，西方和埃及在上面走就可以碰头”，而美国的建议却“使我们退回到我们开始的地方”。
    梅农强调说：“伦敦会议的目的不是要取得多数表决。用最后通牒是不能求得解决的。”会议不能把运河“国际化”作为“号令”，强迫埃及接受。他重申，伦敦会议的整个目的是要导向谈判。他说：“除非我们愿意进行战争，否则我们就必须设法举行谈判。”
    梅农接着说，印度建议的目的就在于使埃及和西方在一起谈判。印度的计划要使西方放弃立场，但是它的目的在于引导会议走向谈判。有了直接接触，然后别的问题就可以得到解决。
    梅农批评美国的建议说，它的实质无法同埃及的主权相调和。杜勒斯要用一个国际管理局来代替已经存在的苏彝士运河管理局，这将是埃及不能接受的。
    梅农归纳这种情况说：“杜勒斯的建议是不能接受来进行谈判的，但是我们的计划是能够接受来进行谈判的。”他还说：“这并不是杜勒斯的建议同我们的建议分歧的程度的问题。它们是两个不同的办法。”
    梅农指出，只有埃及能保证运河通航自由。他说：“如果任何国家企图承担起通航的责任的话，这个国家就是埃及自己。”
    有记者问，梅农所建议的咨询委员会将有怎么样的力量。他回答说：“有施行影响的力量。它将不行使任何强迫的力量。”他又说：“行使力量的唯一其他办法是战争。”
    还有人问，如果在伦敦会议上要进行表决，他将怎么办？梅农回答说：“没有进行表决的问题。不能由我们来接受或者是拒绝。”他还指出，伦敦会议并不是在同运河有关的国家普遍参加的基础上召开的，“如果埃及人不出席，用表决的办法是不会有任何成就的”。
