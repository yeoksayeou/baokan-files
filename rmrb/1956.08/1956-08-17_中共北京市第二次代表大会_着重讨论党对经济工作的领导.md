The Second Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipal Committee
Focuses on Discussing the Party's Leadership over Economic Work

(Our report) The Second Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipal Committee, held from August 2nd to 14th, focused on discussing the Party's leadership over economic work, proposing that the current central task is to mobilize all positive factors and forces to strengthen the construction of a socialist capital. The congress also elected 29 official delegates and 3 alternate delegates to represent Beijing at the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

Comrade Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipal Committee, delivered a report on the current economic situation and main problems on behalf of the Municipal Committee. Comrade Fan Rusheng, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a report on behalf of the Municipal Committee regarding "the campaign to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries." In his report, Comrade Liu Ren pointed out that in the past year, the Beijing Municipal Party organization had victoriously carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction. Significant progress has been made in various constructions.

In terms of industrial capital construction, the past situation of failing to complete state plans has been reversed, and the capital construction work of all major factories and mines has been significantly improved. This year, the city's state-owned industrial output value plan is 24% higher than the actual completion figure last year. In the first half of this year, the total industrial output value increased by 29% compared with the same period last year, completing 112% of the state plan for the first half of the year.

More than 2,000 joint state-private enterprises have completed preliminary restructuring, and have shown significant effects in improving product quality, reducing production costs, and increasing new products. The vast majority of handicraftsmen have been organized, with 840 handicraft cooperatives and 97,054 members.

The capital's construction tasks and municipal construction tasks are becoming increasingly heavy, the proportion of industrial construction and technically complex projects has greatly increased, the main lines of the streets have begun to be rebuilt in a planned way, and the Yongding River water diversion project is about to be completed. The scale of other municipal projects is also increasing. After the decisive victory in the socialist transformation of private commerce, market relations have undergone fundamental changes. Socialist commerce has not only completely controlled wholesale, but also completely controlled retail. This has created extremely favorable conditions for further strengthening market planning and stabilizing prices.

In terms of agricultural production in the suburbs, this year's grain and cotton have achieved bumper harvests, exceeding the highest annual output since liberation. Among them, the yield per unit area of grain increased by 9.2% compared with 1953, the year with the highest output since liberation.

The report also pointed out that although great achievements have been made in various tasks, there are also many shortcomings. After the ubiquitous fanfare, some cadres' minds were not calm. Some agricultural production increase targets were set too high; there was insufficient concrete analysis of the various complex situations of handicrafts, resulting in some blind concentration and disregard for conditions in setting up advanced cooperatives and large cooperatives. In some industries, the economic restructuring of joint state-private industries was carried out without planning at one time. After the high tide of socialist transformation, leadership was not in-depth, and some problems were not resolved in a timely manner, and some problems have not been resolved for a long time.

The congress conducted serious discussions on the Municipal Committee's work report, unfolded serious criticism and self-criticism, and 141 delegates (including written speeches from 53 delegates) spoke at the congress.

The delegates unanimously agreed with the Municipal Committee's work report, believing that Beijing has made great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction in the past year. At the same time, they criticized the shortcomings of the Municipal Committee in leading economic work.

Some delegates believed that the Municipal Committee's leadership of the industrial high tide and the advanced producer movement lagged behind actual work, and they demanded that the Municipal Committee improve its leadership over industry. The delegates criticized that some agricultural cooperatives were run too large, and some leading comrades inappropriately raised production targets on top of the grain and cotton production increase targets set by the Municipal Committee, thus increasing production investment for some agricultural production cooperatives, and neglecting sideline production for a period of time. Some delegates believed that after the high tide of handicraft cooperation, the lack of follow-up leadership in handicraft work resulted in many problems that were not resolved in a timely manner. Some delegates raised the contradiction between unified concentration and flexibility and initiative in the current economic work. They believed that within the scope of the socialist planned economy, there should also be appropriate flexibility in order to fully exert the superiority of the socialist economy.

Representatives from institutions of higher learning pointed out in their speeches: The most important problem facing institutions of higher learning is the contradiction between quantity and quality. All schools generally face difficulties such as insufficient teachers, lagging capital construction, and the inability of library materials and experimental equipment to meet needs. The delegates proposed that the unification of "need" and "possibility" must be seriously considered.

Many district committee representatives suggested that the Municipal Committee should strengthen its leadership over the district committees. They said: The Municipal Committee rarely systematically inspects the work of the district committees, and does not provide enough help in improving the work of the district committees; the Municipal Committee's work arrangements lack planning, and sometimes the various departments of the Municipal Committee assign too many tasks downwards, causing the district committees to be busy, chaotic, and passive. They proposed that the work of the district committees is becoming increasingly heavy, and the staffing of the district committees is too small to meet the needs of the objective situation, and requested an increase in the staffing of the district committees.

Many delegates criticized the bureaucratic and document-oriented work style of the Municipal Committee's leadership. This is reflected in: many leading comrades do not understand the actual situation enough; many documents are empty, stereotyped articles. Some delegates criticized some comrades in the Municipal Committee for not having enough democratic style and considering problems subjectively and one-sidedly. Some delegates also raised criticisms and opinions on the work of various departments of the Municipal Committee.

The delegates discussed the suggestions of the congress presidium regarding the list of candidates from the city's party organizations to attend the Party's Eighth National Congress with a very serious and responsible attitude. Each delegate group fully conducted serious and repeated discussions. The congress presidium replaced four candidates based on the opinions of the groups. Then, more than 20 delegates spoke at the congress, unfolding heated, tit-for-tat debates on the work and ideological style of a small number of delegate candidates; some delegate candidates also made serious self-criticisms at the meeting. The responsible spirit of the delegates and the presidium's full promotion of democratic style made the congress full of a lively and serious democratic atmosphere.

Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen made a summary of the congress. He first pointed out that in the past year, the Beijing Municipal Party organization has implemented the central government's policies and guidelines, and basically completed the capital's socialist transformation work from the perspective of the change in production relations, incorporating various economies into the socialist track. This is a great victory. He said, however, after cooperation and joint state-private ownership, many of our specific tasks have not kept up or have not fully kept up. He went on to point out that although there are many shortcomings and errors in the specific work of socialist transformation, it can in no way obscure the superiority of the socialist economy that has now been manifested. The three non-socialist economic components have all been incorporated into the socialist track, and the productive forces have been greatly liberated. The anarchy of the capitalist economy and small production and the spontaneous tendency of small production are being overcome, the economy of profit-seeking has been transformed into a socialist economy serving the people, the possibility of merchants hoarding, speculating, and disrupting prices has been basically eliminated, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have a further basis for improvement. He pointed out that the key now is to further improve the leadership and management of state-owned industry and commerce, and strengthen its leading role in the entire national economy; to carry out systematic and concrete restructuring work in joint state-private enterprises, and to explore its potential. On the basis of doing a good job in production, we must earnestly solve the distribution problems of agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives, and strive to increase the income of 90% of the members. The key to developing production and improving business management is to summarize our own advanced experience, learn from the advanced experience of others, strive to learn from advanced units across the country, and conduct socialist competition with them.

Comrade Peng Zhen finally focused on the issue of improving leadership. He said that it is necessary to distinguish between priorities and grasp the key issues in the work, and systematically investigate and solve them one by one. Leading comrades should discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and not let problems slip past one by one. He raised this issue to the height of the principle of being responsible to the Party and the people; pointing out that it is an evil habit of the declining class to perfunctorily procrastinate even when problems are staring us in the face. Problems that can be solved by simply moving hands, feet, or mouths are also dragged on, under the pretext of "consideration" and "research," delaying the problem day after day. Some cadres do not investigate and research on their own, propose a problem, and solve a problem, but instead write tens of thousands of words to their superiors in a flat, straightforward paper that does not raise problems or solve problems. All of this is inconsistent with the objective situation that is changing rapidly. Every party member must give full play to socialist enthusiasm, earnestly and responsibly grasp the problem, and solve the problem. It is necessary to conduct regular top-down inspections and carry out bottom-up criticism, study various different situations, and discuss and collaborate well from left to right and up and down. In the past, the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee concentrated too much, took on things they could not do or could not do well; while some responsible units failed to fully exert their creativity and systematically study the work they were in charge of. In the future, we must expand the scope of authority of districts, grassroots units, and various departments of the Municipal Committee and various bureaus of the Municipal People's Committee, allowing them to independently handle specific issues in accordance with the Party and the state's policies and guidelines and the city's unified plan. At the same time, in accordance with work needs and the principles of streamlining and agility, organizational structures and cadres should be appropriately adjusted.

    中共北京市第二次代表大会
    着重讨论党对经济工作的领导
    本报讯　八月二日至十四日举行的中国共产党北京市第二次代表大会，着重讨论了党对经济工作的领导问题，提出当前的中心任务是调动一切积极因素和力量，加强建设社会主义的首都。大会并选举了北京市出席中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的正式代表二十九人，后补代表三人。
    中国共产党北京市委员会第二书记刘仁同志代表市委对当前经济工作的情况和主要问题作了报告。市委副书记范儒生同志代表市委作
  “关于肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的运动”的报告。刘仁同志在报告中指出，在过去一年间，北京市党组织胜利地进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设。各项建设都有了显著的进展。
    在工业基本建设工作方面已经扭转了过去完不成国家计划的状况，所有较大厂矿的基本建设工作都有显著的改进。今年全市国营工业产值计划，比去年实际完成数增加24％。今年上半年工业生产总值比去年同期增长了29％，完成上半年国家计划的112％。
    目前已有2，000多户公私合营工厂完成了初步的改组工作，在提高产品质量、降低生产成本和增加新产品方面都有了显著的效果。人数众多的手工业者，绝大部分已组织起来了，现有840个手工业合作社，97，054个社员。
    首都的建筑任务和市政建设任务日益繁重，工业建筑和技术复杂的工程的比重大大增加，街道主要干线已经开始有计划的改建，永定河引水工程即将完成。其他市政工程的规模也随着增大。对私营商业社会主义改造取得决定性胜利以后，市场关系已发生了根本的变化。社会主义商业不仅全部掌握了批发，而且全部掌握了零售。这就为进一步加强市场的计划性和稳定物价创造了极为有利的条件。
    在郊区农业生产方面，今年粮食、棉花都获得了丰收，超过了解放后最高的年产量。其中粮食的单位面积产量比解放后产量最高的1953年增加了9.2％。
    报告同时指出，虽然各项工作已经取得很大成绩，但缺点也很多。在到处敲锣打鼓以后，干部脑子有些不冷静。对农业增产指标有些订得过高；对手工业的各种复杂情况具体分析不够，造成某些盲目集中和不顾条件地搞高级社和大社的毛病。对公私合营工业的经济改组有的行业一度没有规划就忙于进行。在社会主义改造高潮以后，领导不深入，有些问题没有及时解决，甚至有的问题一直拖了好久，还没有得到解决。
    大会对市委的工作报告进行了认真的讨论，展开了严肃的批评和自我批评，有一百四十一名代表（其中包括五十三个代表的书面发言）在大会上发了言。
    代表们一致同意市委的工作报告，认为北京市一年来在社会主义改造和社会主义建设工作上取得了很大的成绩。同时，对于市委在领导经济工作中的缺点进行了批评。
    有的代表认为，市委对于工业高潮和先进生产者运动的领导有落在实际工作后面的现象，他们要求市委改善对工业的领导。代表们批评了有些农业合作社办得过大，有些领导同志在市委所订的粮、棉增产指标上，又不适当地提高生产指标，因而使一些农业生产合作社加大了生产投资，并且在一个时期内忽视了副业生产。有些代表认为在手工业合作化的高潮以后，由于对手工业工作的领导没有跟上去，因此就使得目前存在的许多问题没有及时解决。有的代表提出了当前经济工作中存在着统一集中和灵活性主动性的矛盾，他们认为，在社会主义计划经济的范围内，也要有适当的灵活性，才能充分发挥社会主义经济的优越性。
    高等学校的代表在发言中提出：高等学校目前最重要的问题是数量和质量相矛盾的问题。各学校普遍存在着师资供不应求、基本建设赶不上，以及图书资料、实验设备不能满足需要等困难。代表们提出，必须严肃考虑“需要”和“可能”相统一的问题。
    很多区委代表提出市委应加强对区委领导。他们说：市委对区委的工作很少系统地检查，对区委工作的改进帮助不够；市委在工作安排上计划性不够，有时市委各部门条条往下布置任务过多，造成区委工作忙乱、被动。他们提出：目前区委工作日益繁重，区委的编制太小，不能适应客观形势的需要，要求增加区委的编制。
    许多代表批评了市委领导作风上的官僚主义和文牍主义。这表现在：许多领导同志对实际情况了解不够；有很多文件是空洞的八股式的文章。有些代表批评了市委个别同志民主作风不够，考虑问题主观片面等。有些代表还对市委各部门的工作提出了批评和意见。
    代表们以十分严肃负责的态度讨论了大会主席团提出的、本市党组织出席党的第八次全国代表大会候选人名单的建议。每个代表小组都充分的进行了认真的反复的讨论。大会主席团根据小组的意见，调换了四名候选人。接着，有二十多名代表在大会上发言，对少数代表候选人的工作和思想作风，展开了热烈的针锋相对的辩论；有的代表候选人还在会上作了认真的自我批评。代表们的负责精神和主席团充分发扬民主作风，使大会充满了活泼而严肃的民主气氛。
    最后，彭真同志作了大会总结。他首先指出，在过去一年中，北京市党组织贯彻执行了中央的方针政策，从生产关系的变革上，基本上完成了首都的社会主义改造工作，把各种经济纳入了社会主义轨道。这是伟大的胜利。他说，但是，在合作化和公私合营以后，我们许多具体工作没有跟上或者没有完全跟上。他接着指出，虽然在社会主义改造的具体工作中有许多缺点和错误，但是它无论如何都不能掩盖现在已经表现出来的社会主义经济的优越性。三种非社会主义经济成份，都已经纳入了社会主义轨道，生产力大大解放了。资本主义经济和小生产的无政府状态和小生产的自发倾向在被克服着，唯利是图的经济，已经被改造成为人民服务的社会主义经济，商人屯积居奇、投机倒把、扰乱物价的可能性已经基本上被消除了，人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平已经有了进一步改善的基础。他指出，现在的关键是对国营工商业要进一步改善领导，改善经营管理，并且加强它在整个国民经济中的领导作用；对公私合营企业进行系统的具体的改组工作，发掘它的潜力。要在搞好生产的基础上，认真解决农业手工业生产合作社的分配问题，力求做到90％的社员增加收入。发展生产、改善经营管理的关键是总结自己的先进经验，学习别人的先进经验，努力向全国先进单位看齐，并且同它们进行社会主义竞赛。
    彭真同志最后着重谈到了改进领导的问题。他说，必须分清轻重缓急，抓住工作中的关键问题，一一系统地加以调查研究和解决。领导同志要及时地发现问题解决问题，不要让问题一个个地从面前溜过去。他把这个问题提到对党、对人民负责的原则高度；指出眼看到问题摆在面前也不解决，这是没落阶级的因循拖延的恶习。明明动动手、动动脚、动动嘴就能解决的问题，也要拖下去，借口“考虑”、“研究”，把问题一天又一天地拖延下去。有些干部不是自己动手调查研究，提出一个问题，解决一个问题，而是洋洋数万言向上级作平铺直叙的、不提出问题、也不解决问题的论文。所有这些都是与一日千里的客观形势不相称的。每个党员都要发挥社会主义充沛的热情，认真负责地抓住问题，解决问题。要经常地进行自上而下的检查和开展自下而上的批评，研究各种不同的情况，并且左右上下很好地商量协作。过去市委、市人民委员会集中的事情偏多，包了又不能办或是办不好；而有些主管的单位又未能充分地发挥创造性，系统地钻研自己所管的工作。今后要扩大区、基层和市委各部、市人民委员会各局的职权范围，让他们按照党和国家的方针政策和全市的统一计划独立地处理具体问题。同时要根据工作需要，按照精简和办事敏捷的原则，适当调整组织机构和干部。
