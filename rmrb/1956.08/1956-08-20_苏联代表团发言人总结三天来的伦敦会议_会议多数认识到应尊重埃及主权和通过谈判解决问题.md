Xinhua News Agency, London, August 19th: The spokesman for the Soviet delegation, Ilyichev, held a press conference here on the afternoon of the 18th, summarizing the discussions on the Suez Canal issue at the three-day London conference.

He said: (1) With the exception of a few, almost everyone participating in the conference did not ignore the fact that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was an internal affair of Egypt.

(2) Under the influence of public opinion, almost all participants in the conference abandoned the idea of resolving the dispute by force or threat of force, and agreed that the only possible solution was negotiation.

(3) Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov has put forward realistic proposals that take into account the national interests of Egypt, as well as the principles of maintaining peace and non-interference in internal affairs.

(4) Under modern conditions, no country can rely on force to make any decision that violates the national interests of another country.

Ilyichev expressed regret that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a conference with broader representation.

Ilyichev refuted the assertion that Egypt was incapable of managing the Suez Canal. He said that this argument was based on colonialism and a policy of interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and was therefore unreasonable.

Lloyd had rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a conference with broader representation, citing the urgency of the matter. Journalists asked Ilyichev to comment on Lloyd's reaction. Ilyichev said that the Suez Canal issue must be considered calmly, without prejudice, and wisely. No matter how urgent the issue, without such consideration, there will be no good results.

Ilyichev also mentioned Shepilov's statement on the 17th regarding Dulles not mentioning the Tripartite Declaration at all, saying: "Our impression is that Dulles' attitude is: he is trying to find possible solutions to the problem."

    苏联代表团发言人总结三天来的伦敦会议
    会议多数认识到应尊重埃及主权和通过谈判解决问题
    新华社伦敦19日电　苏联代表团发言人伊利切夫十八日下午在这里举行的记者招待会上总结了这三天伦敦会议讨论苏彝士运河问题的情况。
    他说：（一）除了少数人以外，几乎所有参加会议的人都没有忽视这个事实：把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是埃及的内政问题。
    （二）在舆论的影响下，几乎所有参加会议的人都放弃以武力或武力威胁来解决纠纷的想法，而同意唯一可能的办法是进行谈判。
    （三）苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫已经提出了现实的建议，这种建议考虑到埃及的民族利益，也考虑到维护和平和不干涉内政的原则。
    （四）在现代的条件下，任何国家都不能依靠武力作出违反某一个国家的民族利益的任何决定。
    伊利切夫对于英国外交大臣劳埃德拒绝苏联主张召开一个具有更广泛代表性的会议的建议表示遗憾。
    伊利切夫驳斥了所谓埃及没有能力管理苏彝士运河的说法。他说，这种论调是以殖民主义和干涉他国内政的政策为根据的，因此是没有道理的。
    劳埃德曾经借口时间紧迫而拒绝苏联主张召开一个具有更广泛代表性的会议的建议。新闻记者请伊利切夫对劳埃德这种反应表示意见。伊利切夫说，对苏彝士运河问题必须作冷静的、没有偏见的、明智的考虑。不论问题如何迫切，如果没有这样的考虑，就不会有任何好结果。
    伊利切夫还提到谢皮洛夫十七日所说的关于杜勒斯丝毫没有提到三国宣言这句话，他说：“我们的印象是，杜勒斯的态度是：他正在设法寻找解决问题的可能的办法”。
