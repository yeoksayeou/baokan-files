    Improving Workers' Lives in Many Ways
    Yao Fu

    Currently, the issue of improving workers' lives has attracted attention from all sides and has achieved some success. Many provincial and municipal party and government leaders, enterprise administrators, and trade union cadres have personally visited workers' families, discovered many problems, and solved many problems. In places where leading organs and leaders attach importance to improving workers' lives, the scope of labor insurance funds has been expanded, many workers in difficulty have received subsidies, children have schools, babies have nurseries, cafeteria food has become more varied, prices have become cheaper, rents, utilities, and transportation costs have been reduced, and the prices of daily necessities have stabilized. By solving many practical problems in workers' lives, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been strengthened, and the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of workers have been improved.

    From the recent solutions to workers' living problems in many cities and factories, a common characteristic can be seen: spending less money and doing more things. Sixteen units in Qiqihar City mobilized qualified workers to "build their own homes with public assistance" and by the end of September this year, 1,500 workers will have moved into new homes; Shenyang City adopted the method proposed by Gao Rongyuan, a people's representative from Heping District, mobilizing residents to vacate surplus houses and exchange them with each other over distances, so that 1,000 households lacking housing and workers whose homes were far from the factory have convenient places to live; many units in Wuhu and Beijing have launched competitions between canteens, solving the problem of crowded worker dining and improving the quality of meals. All of this fully proves that improving workers' lives should start from many aspects. As long as you pay attention to these issues, come up with ideas, spend very little money, or no money at all, you can solve many problems for the masses.

    However, this method has not been universally accepted. Some leading comrades often neglect to tap the potential of their region or enterprise and only plan to rely on state funding to solve problems. This idea is unrealistic and one-sided. Of course, state funding is an important source for solving workers' living and welfare problems. In fact, the state has already allocated a large amount of funds, and in the future, it will allocate more funds to improve workers' living and welfare. However, this is ultimately limited. Therefore, in addition to striving to use limited state funds to do more things, we must also mobilize all aspects of strength and work hard in all aspects to improve workers' lives. It should be recognized that solving workers' living difficulties is a comprehensive social work, and problems in any link will affect workers' lives to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, the work of every link must be grasped and managed.

    Some workers criticize enterprise leaders for "only caring about eight hours of production and not caring about sixteen hours of life." This is a very profound and very sharp criticism. If we want the masses to do a good job in "eight hours" of production, we must care about the "sixteen hours" of life of the masses, and we must solve the problems of the masses' clothing, food, housing, disease prevention, and marriage. In short, we must put all the problems in the lives of the masses on our agenda. Now some comrades use the excuses of "being busy!" "political leadership!" "principled leadership!" "trivial matters under the nose!" not to care about these issues, and as a result, production is not done well.

    What is the "secret" to managing the "sixteen hours"? The "secret" is: look more, listen more, think more. As the saying goes: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." When you sit safely in the office with your briefcase, picking up the daily production report, you may think that your work is responsible and successful; but when you step into the threshold of a worker's home or sickroom, when you see dark light, a lot of coal smoke, damp ground, and three generations living in the same room, when you see flies crawling all over the food, when you see a sick person thirsty and no one cares, it will change your original ideas, stimulate your sense of responsibility, and prompt you to seriously solve these problems.

    Generally speaking, our enterprise leading cadres have a strong mass viewpoint. If some neglect the living problems of workers, they can immediately change if they are promptly reminded. However, enterprise leading cadres also have some difficulties in their actual work that need to be resolved by higher-level organs. For example, financial regulations are too strict, the room for maneuver is too small, procedures are too cumbersome, and problem-solving is dragged out. Often, the masses raise problems, enterprise leading cadres also propose solutions, and ask higher authorities for instructions, but the problem remains unresolved. It is hoped that the competent departments will consider appropriately increasing their powers, giving them room for maneuver, so that they can solve various problems in workers' lives in a timely manner.

### 从多方面改善职工生活

    从多方面改善职工生活
    药夫
    目前，改善职工生活问题，已经引起各方面的注意，收到了一定的成绩。许多省市党政领导干部企业行政和工会干部，都亲自访问了职工家庭，发现了许多问题，解决了许多问题。在领导机关和领导人员重视改善职工生活的地方，劳动保险基金使用范围扩大了，许多有困难的职工得到了补助，儿童有了学校，婴儿有了乳儿室，食堂饭菜花样增加了，价钱便宜了，房租、水电、交通费用减低了，日用品价格稳定了。由于解决了职工生活上许多实际问题，党同群众的关系密切了，职工的政治觉悟和生产积极性提高了。
    从最近许多城市和厂矿解决职工生活问题中，可以看出一个共同的特点：花钱少，办事多。齐齐哈尔市十六个单位发动有条件的职工“自建公助”修筑房屋，到今年九月底就会有一千五百名职工迁入新居；沈阳市采纳了和平区人民代表高荣远倡议的办法，动员居民腾出多余房屋和远近互相对换，使一千户缺房户和住宅离工厂较远的职工得到方便的安身之所；芜湖和北京的许多单位展开了食堂之间的竞赛，解决了职工吃饭拥挤的问题，提高了饭菜质量。所有这些都充分证明：改善职工生活应该从多方面着手，只要你去注意一下这些问题，出出主意，花很少的钱，或者不花钱，就可能给群众解决许多问题。
    但是，这种方法还没有普遍接受，有些领导同志往往忽视挖掘本地区的或企业内部的潜力，只打算依赖国家拨款来解决问题。这种想法是不现实的，带有片面性的。固然，国家拨款是解决职工生活福利问题的一个重要来源，事实上国家也已拨了大批资金，今后还会拨更多的资金来改善职工的生活福利，但是这毕竟有一定的限度。因此，我们除了力求把有限的国家资金用来办更多的事以外，还要动员各方面的力量，从各方面努力来改善职工生活。应该这样认识：解决职工生活困难是一个全面的社会性的工作，那一个环节有了毛病都会使职工生活受到或大或小的影响，因此，那一个环节的工作都要抓、都要管。
    有些工人批评企业的领导者“只管八小时生产，不管十六小时生活”。这是非常深刻、非常尖锐的批评。我们要群众干好“八小时”的生产，就必须去关心群众“十六小时”的生活，就必须去解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，把一切群众生活上的问题，都提到自己的议事日程上来。现在有些同志借口“工作忙呀！”“政治领导呀！”“原则领导呀！”“鼻子下的小事呀！”不去关心这些问题，结果生产搞不好。
    管“十六小时”的“秘诀”是什么呢？“秘诀”就是：多看、多听、多想。俗语说得好：“百闻不如一见”，当你夹着皮包安然坐在办公室里，拿起生产日报表的时候，也许以为自己工作是负责的、有成绩的；可是当你一迈进职工家庭或病室的门槛的时候，当你看到光线黑暗，煤烟很多，地面潮湿，三代同房的时候，当你见到食物上爬满了苍蝇的时候，当你看到病人口渴没有人过问的时候，便会改变你原来的想法，激发了你的责任感，促使你去认真解决这些问题。
    我们的企业领导干部一般说都是群众观点很强的，有的忽视了职工生活问题，只要及时提醒，也能立即转变。但是企业领导干部在实际工作中也有一些困难，是需要上级机关来解决的。例如财务制度规定得太严，机动的余地过小，手续过繁，解决问题拖拉，往往群众把问题提出来了，企业领导干部也提出了解决的办法，向上级请示了，可是问题还是原封未动，不能解决。希望主管部门考虑适当加大他们的权利，给以机动余地，让他们有可能及时解决职工生活上的各种问题。
