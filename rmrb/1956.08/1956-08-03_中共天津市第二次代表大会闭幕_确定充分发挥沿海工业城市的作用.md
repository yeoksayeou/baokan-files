Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 1st. The Second Tianjin Municipal Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, centered on the theme of "Unearthing all potential, developing the economy, and supporting the country's socialist construction," successfully concluded on the 30th.

Through this congress, the delegates further clarified Tianjin's important role in supporting inland industrial construction. They unanimously agreed that Tianjin is one of China's long-standing comprehensive coastal industrial bases, with not only a longer history of industrial development and a certain level of technical strength and experience, but also a large untapped potential in its equipment. For example, with an additional investment of 14.91 million yuan in the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, the output of steel ingots could be 4.83 times the planned output for this year, the output of steel could increase by 1.68 times, labor productivity could increase by 80%, and costs could be reduced by 20%, increasing profits by 46 million yuan annually. Therefore, the delegates believed that: fully utilizing existing equipment, carrying out necessary renovations, expansions, and conditional new construction with less investment, continuously improving quality, increasing variety, and reducing costs, in order to complete various production tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, providing technology, capital, and technical personnel for national key construction, and meeting the growing needs of the people for industrial products, is a major and glorious task for the entire Party and the people of Tianjin.

The congress believed that Tianjin has played a certain role in the past few years. For example, the city's total industrial output value has been increasing year by year. Among them, the production of means of production in 1955 increased by 7.99 times compared with 1949, and the production of consumer goods increased by 3.17 times. The output of major products such as electricity, steel, metal cutting machine tools, cotton cloth, rubber shoes, and bicycles was equivalent to 213.51% to 2353.4% of that in 1949. It is estimated that the city's total output value will reach the level of 1957 this year, and the technical level has also been greatly improved. In addition, the number of employees, labor productivity, and profits have also increased to varying degrees.

However, the congress pointed out that due to insufficient understanding of the important role of coastal industrial cities in the past, there are still many problems. The first is the low quality, limited variety, and high cost of industrial products. According to statistics from the local industrial department at the end of last year, among 457 products, the quality of 157 products fluctuated or was consistently poor, making them unpopular with the masses. The congress believed that the existence of this phenomenon was mainly due to insufficient understanding of the purpose of socialist production, leading to a one-sided pursuit of quantity and profit. Since the beginning of this year, various factories have criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and launched a socialist competition and advanced producer movement centered on improving quality under the slogan of striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Although the quality of some products has improved to varying degrees, further efforts are still needed. Secondly, the problem of mutual coordination and collaboration between industrial and trade departments has not been completely resolved for a long time due to departmentalism on both sides and some systemic problems, which has also affected the development of production. For example, the plans of the two sides are not connected, or industrial production does not meet the requirements of consumers, or the supply of raw materials is not timely, etc., which affects the busy and idle production of some factories and handicraft cooperatives, which is very abnormal, and even causes some factories and cooperatives to lose money, affecting the发挥 of production potential. Thirdly, there is insufficient concern for the lives of workers. For example, since 1952, the city's labor productivity has increased by 39.98%, but the average wage of workers has only increased by 6%, and due to the cancellation of year-end double wages, cooperative benefits, and rising prices since 1953, the actual living standards of workers have declined. The lack of housing for workers is very common, and the cultural life of many people cannot be satisfied. Fourthly, the previous municipal party committee failed to provide effective guidance to actual work departments on certain policy issues. For example, in the production reorganization of handicrafts, greed for largeness, speed, and blind merger of cooperatives caused chaos for a certain period of time, affecting the normal progress of production; ineffective implementation of the advanced producer movement and stagnation of the movement also affected the发挥 of mass enthusiasm.

The congress fully promoted democracy and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The delegates believed that the main problem of the previous municipal party committee and many leading departments was bureaucracy, lack of contact with the masses, and insufficient in-depth understanding of reality. They lacked in-depth and meticulous research and concrete organizational work on major policies, rarely went down to inspect and solve practical problems, and were satisfied with verbal appeals for some problems, lacking concrete methods, or only arranged tasks without inspection. For example, the problems of low quality, limited variety, and uncoordinated industrial and trade relations in industrial production have existed for several years, and the municipal party committee has repeatedly called for solutions, but has not specifically and earnestly helped to solve them. Even in a city dominated by industrial production, the municipal party committee has not taken charge of industrial production. Bureaucracy is also manifested in overlapping institutions, slow handling of affairs, and insufficient concern for the suffering of the masses. The congress believed that the existence of bureaucracy is an obstacle to future发挥 of potential and should be vigorously overcome.

The delegates were full of confidence in fully leveraging the role of coastal industrial cities and supporting inland construction. Many people put forward goals and methods for 发挥 potential and planned the future prospects based on the new tasks and the actual situation of their departments.

Finally, the congress elected new members of the municipal party committee and delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Party on the basis of fully promoting democracy.

The congress opened on the 19th, with 663 delegates and 200 observers attending. A total of 148 people spoke or submitted written speeches at the congress. At the opening, Comrade Huang Huoqing delivered a work report on behalf of the previous municipal party committee.

### 中共天津市第二次代表大会闭幕  确定充分发挥沿海工业城市的作用

    中共天津市第二次代表大会闭幕
    确定充分发挥沿海工业城市的作用
    据新华社天津1日电　以“发掘一切潜力、发展经济、支援国家社会主义建设”为中心议题的中共天津市第二次代表大会，在三十日胜利闭幕。
    通过这次大会，代表们进一步明确了天津市在支援内地工业建设上的重要作用，一致认为天津是我国沿海旧有的综合性的工业基地之一，不仅工业发展的历史较长，有一定的技术力量和经验，而且设备潜力很大，还没有充分发挥。例如国营天津钢厂如果再投资1，491万元，钢锭的产量就可以相当于今年计划产量的四点八三倍，钢材的产量可以增加一点六八倍，劳动生产率提高80％，成本降低20％，每年可增加利润四千六百万元。因此，代表们认为：充分利用现有设备，以较少的投资进行必要的改建、扩建和有条件的新建，不断地提高质量、增加品种、降低成本，以更多、更快、更好、更省地完成各项生产任务，为国家重点建设提供技术、资金和技术人材，满足广大人民对工业品日益增长的需要，是天津全党和全市人民重大而光荣的任务。
    大会认为，天津在过去几年中已发挥了一定的作用。如全市工业总产值逐年都在增长，其中生产资料的生产1955年比1949年增长七点九九倍，消费资料的生产增长三点一七倍，主要产品中的电力、钢、金属切削机床、棉布、胶鞋、自行车等的产量相等于1949年的213.51％到2353.4％，预计全市的生产总值今年即可达到1957年的水平，技术水平也有很大提高。此外，职工人数、劳动生产率和利润也都有不同程度的增长。
    但是，大会指出，由于过去对沿海工业城市的重大作用认识不足，因此还存在着不少问题。首先是工业产品的质量低、品种少、成本高。根据去年年底地方工业部对457种产品的统计，有157种产品的质量忽高忽低或者质量长期不好，不受群众欢迎。大会认为，存在这种现象主要是因为对社会主义的生产目的性认识不足，片面追求数量和利润所致。今年以来，各厂批判了右倾保守思想，在争取提前完成五年计划的口号之下，展开了以提高质量为中心的社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，虽有若干产品的质量有了不同程度的提高，但还需要作进一步的努力。其次，工业和贸易部门的相互配合、协作问题，因为双方都有本位主义思想，加上体制上有些问题，长期没有得到彻底解决，也影响着生产的发展。如双方计划不衔接，或者是工业生产不适合消费者的要求，或者原料供应不及时等等，这样就影响到有些工厂和手工业社生产时忙时闲，很不正常，甚至使若干厂、社赔钱，影响生产潜力的发挥。第三是对职工生活关心不够，如自1952年以来全市劳动生产率增长了39.98％，但职工的平均工资仅增长6％，而且由于1953年以来取消了年终双薪、合作社优待以及物价上升等原因，工人的实际生活水平反而有所下降。职工缺乏住房的现象很普遍，很多人的文化生活也得不到满足。第四，上届市委在某些政策问题上对实际工作部门指导不力。如在对手工业的生产改组中贪大、求快，盲目并社等，就曾造成一定时期的混乱，影响了生产的正常进行；对先进生产者运动贯彻不力，运动停滞不前，也影响了群众积极性的发挥。
    大会充分发扬了民主，开展了批评与自我批评。代表们认为上届市委和许多领导部门的主要问题是官僚主义，联系群众、深入实际不够。对重大政策缺乏深入细致的研究和具体的组织工作，很少下去检查和解决实际问题，对有些问题满足于口头上的号召，缺乏具体的办法，或者只有布置没有检查。如工业生产的质量低、品种少和工业贸易关系不协调等问题，已存在好几年了，市委也曾一再号召要解决，但却没有具体认真的去帮助解决。甚至在这样一个以工业生产为主的城市，市委却没有把工业生产掌管起来。官僚主义还表现在机构重叠，办事拖拉和对群众的疾苦关心不够等方面。大会认为：官僚主义的存在是今后发挥潜力的障碍，应该大力克服。
    代表们对充分发挥沿海工业城市的作用，支援内地建设，都充满了信心。许多人都根据新的任务和本部门的实际情况提出了发挥潜力的目标和办法，规划了未来的远景。
    大会最后在充分发扬民主的基础上选出了新的市委委员和出席党的第八次全国代表大会的代表。
    大会自十九日开幕，出席代表663人，列席二百人，在大会上发言和书面发言的共148人。在开幕时，黄火青同志代表上届市委作了工作报告。
