    Beijing Students Rally to Support Egypt's Just Actions
    (Our report) A grand rally was held by Beijing students on the evening of July 31st to support the just actions of the Egyptian people in defending national independence and state sovereignty. The conference unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Egyptian University Students Union. The telegram stated: Since Egyptian President Nasser announced on July 26 the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the students of Beijing and all the Chinese people have been elated by this just action of the Egyptian people. Chinese students are willing to unite more closely with the Egyptian people and persist in the struggle for the common cause - against colonialism, against imperialism and for the maintenance of world peace.
    Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, and Lu Danyun, a student of Peking University, both spoke at the meeting in support of the just actions of the Egyptian people.
    Bai Hayin Ding·Zharan, an Egyptian professor from the China Islamic Institute, was invited to attend the meeting and gave a speech. He described the struggle of the Egyptian people to dig the Suez Canal, the criminal facts of imperialism occupying this canal, and the history of the Egyptian patriots' struggle for the independence and freedom of their motherland. He concluded by saying: We are absolutely not afraid of imperialist threats, and what the people intend to do must be done to the end.
