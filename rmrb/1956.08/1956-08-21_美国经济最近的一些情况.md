Some Recent Developments in the U.S. Economy
    Fang Dihuai

    Recently, U.S. officials and some newspapers have made many optimistic pronouncements about the current U.S. economic situation. With the election fast approaching, this increasing optimism is not difficult to understand. However, a closer look at the economic realities of the United States reveals that these optimistic predictions have little reliable basis.

    Optimists like to cite some of the U.S. government's published economic statistics. For example, the U.S. gross national product reached an unprecedented annual rate of $403.4 billion in the first quarter of this year, exceeding the peak of the fourth quarter of last year; in the second quarter of this year, it created a new record of $408.5 billion at an annual rate, 5.4% more than the same period last year. Total U.S. private domestic investment reached an annual rate of $64.6 billion in the second quarter of this year, 2.3% more than in the first quarter and 7.3% more than in the same period last year. The number of employed people in the United States has been rising in the first half of this year. In June, although the number of unemployed people increased to 2.9 million (300,000 more than in May), the number of employed people also increased to an unprecedented 66.5 million (the simultaneous increase in the number of unemployed and employed people is due to a group of graduates joining the labor force in June), 2.5 million more than in June last year and 1.05 million more than in the previous record month (August last year). They attempt to use these kinds of figures to make people believe that the U.S. economy is healthy and is continuing to rise.
        
        Declining Trend

    In fact, U.S. industrial production has been declining since the beginning of this year. The U.S. industrial production index published by the Federal Reserve Board (with 1947-49 as 100) has fallen from 144 in December last year to 141 in June this year. Moreover, and more importantly, this overall industrial production index does not reflect the fact that serious slumps have occurred in many important industrial sectors. The reason why the overall industrial production index has not fallen sharply is that some other industrial sectors (mainly those related to military needs and belonging to the first category) are still maintaining large-scale production. But the downward trend is clear.

    The basic reason for the downward trend in the U.S. economy is overproduction. Last year, the expansion of U.S. production far exceeded market demand, resulting in total inventories in industry and commerce reaching an unprecedented $82.1 billion at the end of last year, $4.6 billion more than at the end of 1954, and $1 billion more than the previous peak that caused the large-scale production reduction in 1953-54 – the inventory quantity at the end of 1953. Inventories increased further to $84.3 billion by the end of April this year. Moreover, many commodities were not sold last year based on residents' actual purchasing power, but relied on consumer credit. Taking the two pillars of last year's U.S. "prosperity" - automobile production and residential construction - more than half of automobiles were sold on installment plans, and about 80% of residences were sold on mortgage loans. As a result, total personal consumer debt reached a peak of $36.2 billion at the end of last year. According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Board, about two-thirds of American households are either in debt for purchases on credit or have mortgage debt, and about one-sixth of households have both types of debt. This weakens consumers' future purchasing power and market demand, making future sales more difficult.

    Since the beginning of this year, the impact of overproduction has been evident in many industrial sectors in the United States. Small cars (and related industries), residential construction, television sets and radios, household appliances, textiles, clothing, leather, timber, and agricultural machinery have all encountered serious sales difficulties, and production has been greatly reduced.

    Most notably, automobile production has declined sharply. Last year, the United States produced nearly eight million small cars, resulting in serious overproduction. Despite large-scale sales on credit through installment plans, there were still 850,000 unsold new cars in stock at the end of the year. In the first half of this year, small car production decreased by a quarter compared to the same period last year, but inventories still increased to 900,000 in May. People in the U.S. automobile industry are predicting that the automobile industry will be even more depressed in the third quarter of this year. They believe that if the situation improves somewhat in the fourth quarter, making this year's small car production reach 5.8 million vehicles, which is about 72% of last year's output, they would be satisfied.

    The automobile is a very important comprehensive industry, and its prosperity or decline directly affects many other production sectors. Last year's U.S. "prosperity" was, to a certain extent, driven by the large increase in automobile production. This year's reduction in automobile production has already caused the recession of the rubber, glass, copper, and other related industries. The steel industry, which supplied 29% of its products to automobile production last year, did not reduce production in the first half of this year because, in addition to the increased demand for steel in sectors such as machinery manufacturing, factory construction, and railway equipment, steel companies also stocked up on large quantities of finished products to strengthen their position in negotiating new contracts with unions and to prepare for strikes after the negotiations broke down.

    Another pillar of the U.S. economic "prosperity" – residential construction – has also declined sharply since the beginning of this year. New housing starts in the first half of this year were 18% less than in the same period last year, and 41% less in June than in the same period last year. The reduction in residential construction has also reduced market demand for steel, cement, household appliances, and other products related to residential construction.

    The decline of the radio and television industry is even more astonishing. This spring, the production rates of radios and television sets each decreased by 40% and 41% compared to last year's peak.

    The situation of the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, which has been in recession for a long time, is the most miserable. According to a survey by "The New York Times", this spring, the sales rate of American agricultural machinery companies decreased by 50% to 80% compared to a year ago. In many regional markets, agricultural machinery is simply ignored. The production volume of agricultural machinery has been greatly reduced, and some factories have reduced production by half.

    The decline of the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry is closely related to the deterioration of the agricultural crisis. Although the export of agricultural products has increased under the multi-faceted promotion of the U.S. government using U.S. "aid", the U.S. government's accumulated surplus agricultural products have continued to increase, reaching nearly nine billion U.S. dollars this spring, while at the end of last year it was more than eight billion U.S. dollars, and at the end of the year before last it was more than seven billion U.S. dollars. Last year, the total income of American farmers decreased to 10.6 billion U.S. dollars, more than 10% less than in 1954 and 37% less than in 1947. Although agricultural product prices have rebounded somewhat this year, the economic situation of farmers has not improved. According to a May 1st "New York Times" report, the cash income of American farmers this spring was 7% less than a year ago.

    There are signs that the downward trend is still spreading to other economic sectors.

        Factors Offsetting the Decline

    Of course, it cannot be said that the U.S. economy has begun a comprehensive recession, because some rising factors in the U.S. economy are still playing a role in offsetting the decline. This is mainly the increase in government spending and corporate fixed capital investment.

    U.S. government (including federal, state, and local governments) spending reached an annual rate of $78.5 billion in the first quarter of this year, the highest peak since the end of the Korean War. In the second quarter of this year, government spending increased again to an annual rate of $78.6 billion, twenty-four billion dollars more than the same period last year. Most of the federal government spending is so-called "security" expenses, which are more than 40 billion each year.

    This year, due to the significant downward trend in the U.S. economy, the Eisenhower government disregarded its promise to reduce federal spending and increased federal spending by 1.7 billion dollars for the 1956 fiscal year ending on June 30 (mainly because of increased military spending and agricultural subsidies). According to U.S. newspapers, federal spending for the 1957 fiscal year will continue to increase, mainly because of increased military spending and public works spending.

    The increase in government spending can certainly stimulate production in some economic sectors, but on the other hand, it increases the burden on the people and reduces the purchasing power of taxpayers. In the long run, it will not have a beneficial impact on the total social demand with payment capacity. In essence, this is mainly a policy of relying on sacrificing the interests of the working people to maintain the maximum profits for monopoly capitalists.

    The increase in private investment has been heavily publicized in the U.S. newspapers and is considered a reliable basis for "prosperity". U.S. corporate fixed capital investment reached an annual rate of $26.8 billion in the first quarter of this year, 5% more than in the fourth quarter of last year and 23% more than in the same period last year. It is said that the fixed capital investment that the U.S. business community intends to carry out this year will be 30% more than last year's unprecedented record.

    The expansion of fixed capital can indeed improve the production and employment levels of some economic sectors (mainly machinery manufacturing, factory construction, and transportation equipment, etc.) within a certain period of time, but on the other hand, under the capitalist system where the relative and absolute impoverishment of the working people, this further expands the contradiction between social productivity and purchasing power, making the potential crisis more profound.

    The rapid expansion of fixed capital in the United States in recent years has far exceeded the proportion of market demand. A survey by the U.S. "Economic Notes" believes that as early as 1953, the utilization rate of U.S. industrial equipment was only about 55%. The production capacity of U.S. industrial equipment in 1955 expanded by about 50% compared to 1950 when the Korean War broke out. However, last year's total industrial output value in the United States only increased by about a quarter compared to 1950. Obviously, this畸形的 (abnormal) expansion of fixed capital cannot continue indefinitely.

    In fact, many companies are renewing and expanding production equipment because sales are difficult and they must improve technology and update production equipment to carry out fierce competition. For example, the automobile industry has shown serious overproduction since the end of last year, but the automobile industry plans to increase this year's investment by more than half compared to last year. Among them, General Motors announced that it plans to use one billion U.S. dollars this year to innovate and add production equipment (last year it was more than 600 million U.S. dollars).

    Companies that expand production equipment are pinning their hopes on expanding sales. However, in fact, before reaching this hope, the increase in unsold inventories and the expansion of investment have already caused financial difficulties for many companies. Even such huge monopoly organizations as General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and General Electric Company have also used methods such as issuing additional shares, issuing bonds, and borrowing from banks to raise funds since the beginning of this year. Therefore, the total amount of industrial and commercial debt has increased rapidly. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board therefore had to announce in April this year that it would raise the discount rate to 3%, which is already the fifth credit tightening measure announced within a year.

    It can be seen that the U.S. companies' plan to expand investment on a large scale is actually very risky and is not without major difficulties.

    The increase in exports has also played a role in stimulating the production of some industrial sectors in the United States. In the first four months of this year, the total value of U.S. exports reached more than 5.7 billion U.S. dollars (including 388.6 million U.S. dollars of military supplies), 14% more than the same period last year. However, whether the U.S. exports can continue to increase like this in the future is a question. Over the past two years, U.S. exports have been increasing, mainly because the industrial expansion of Western Europe requires the import of large quantities of U.S. industrial equipment and other commodities. However, the industrial expansion of Western Europe has also increased the competitive ability of Western Europe, which in turn affects U.S. exports. As competition has become increasingly fierce, and because the industrial expansion of Western Europe has recently begun to stagnate, some people in the U.S. economic community are already predicting that U.S. exports may decrease.

            Prospects

    In general, in the first half of this year, the U.S. economy has presented a rather unstable situation; although there are still some rising factors, the downward trend is still gradually developing.

    In order to stop or delay the downward trend, the Eisenhower government has taken some new measures. For example, in May and June, Eisenhower successively signed the Agricultural Act, which uses government subsidies to reduce agricultural production, and the public works bill, which stipulates that 37.2 billion U.S. dollars will be used to build highways within thirteen years. In July, the House of Representatives also passed the government's proposal to dump 3 billion U.S. dollars (twice as much as the previous year) of surplus agricultural products to foreign countries by accepting payment in foreign currencies.

    The actual effectiveness of these U.S. government's "crisis prevention" economic measures will be proven by facts.

    美国经济最近的一些情况
    方迪怀
    最近，美国官方人士和某些报刊对当前的美国经济状况发表了许多乐观论调。由于大选快要到来，这种乐观论调日益增多，是不难理解的。不过，人们只要比较仔细地观察一下美国的经济现实，就会发现，这些乐观的预言并没有多少可靠的根据。
    乐观论者们最喜欢引用美国官方发表的关于美国经济的一些统计数字。例如说，美国国民生产总值在今年第一季达到年率4，034亿美元的空前纪录，超过了去年第四季的高峰；今年第二季又创造了4，085亿美元年率的新纪录，比去年同期多5.4％。美国私人国内投资总额在今年第二季达到年率646亿美元，比第一季多2.3％，比去年同期多7.3％。美国的就业人数在今年上半年一直上升，六月间，虽然失业人数增加到290万人（比五月份多30万），但是就业人数也增加到6，650万人的空前纪录（失业和就业人数同时增多，是因为六月份有一批毕业学生参加到劳动队伍中去），比去年六月份多250万人，比上一次创纪录的月份（去年八月）多105万多。他们企图利用这一类的数字，使人相信美国的经济是健康的，是在继续上升中。
        下降的趋势
    事实上，今年以来，美国的工业生产已经下降。联邦贮备局发表的美国工业生产指数（以1947—49年为一百），已经从去年十二月的144下降到今年六月的141。而且，更重要的是，这个总的工业生产指数还没有表现出许多重要工业部门已经发生严重不景气这一事实。总的工业生产指数之所以没有急剧下降，是因为另外一些工业部门（主要是与军需有关的和属于第一部类的部门）仍然维持着庞大生产的缘故。但是下降的趋势是明显的。
    美国经济中出现下降的趋势，基本原因是生产过剩。去年美国的生产扩张远远超过了市场的需求，结果使工商业中的存货总额在去年年底达到821亿美元的空前纪录，比1954年底多46亿美元，比曾经引起1953—54年生产大缩减的上一次高峰——1953年底的存货数量还多十亿美元。存货到今年四月底更增加到843亿美元。况且，去年有许多商品并不是在居民实有购买力的基础上出售，而是依靠消费信用出售的。拿去年美国“繁荣”的两大支柱——汽车生产和住宅建筑来说，汽车有一半以上是用分期付款的办法售出的，住宅有80％左右是用抵押贷款售出的。结果，个人消费债务总额在去年年底达到362亿美元的高峰。据联邦贮备局最近所作的调查，美国消费者中约有三分之二的户口不是负有赊购债务就是负有抵押债务，约有六分之一的户口同时负有两种债务。这样，就削弱了消费者未来的购买力和市场需求，从而使日后的销售更加困难。
    今年以来，生产过剩的影响已经在美国许多工业部门中显现出来。小型汽车（及其有关行业）、住宅建筑、电视机和收音机、家用设备、纺织、服装、皮革、木材和农业机器等部门，都遭遇到严重的销售困难，生产量大大缩减。
    最值得注意的，是汽车生产的锐减。去年美国生产了近八百万辆小型汽车，结果造成严重的生产过剩，尽管用分期付款的办法大量赊销，到年底时仍然积存了滞销新车八十五万辆。今年上半年，小型汽车生产量比去年同期减少了四分之一，但是存货在五月间仍然增加到九十万辆。美国汽车工业界人士都在预言，汽车业到今年第三季将更加萧条。他们认为，如果情况在第四季有所改善，使今年的小型汽车生产量达到580万辆，即相当于去年产量的72％左右，就很满意了。
    汽车是一门很重要的综合性工业，它的盛衰直接影响到其它许多生产部门。去年美国的“繁荣”，在一定的程度上就是由于汽车大量增产而带动起来的。今年汽车的减产，已经引起了橡胶、玻璃、铜和其它有关工业的衰退。去年以29％的产品供应汽车生产的钢铁工业，在今年上半年之所以没有减产，除局部因为机器制造、厂房建筑和铁路装备等部门增加了钢的需求量之外，还因为钢铁公司为了加强自己在同工会谈判新合同时的地位和准备应付谈判破裂后的罢工而贮备大量成品。
    美国经济“繁荣”的另一支柱——住宅建筑，今年以来也急骤下降。新开工的住宅建筑，今年上半年比去年同期少18％，而六月份比去年同期少41％。住宅建筑的减少，同时也缩小了市场上对钢铁、水泥、家用设备和其它同住宅建筑有关的产品的需求。
    收音机和电视机工业的衰落，更是惊人。今年春季，收音机和电视机的生产率比去年的最高峰各下降了40％和41％。
    许久以来就不景气的农业机器制造业的情况，最为悲惨。据“纽约时报”所作的调查，今年春季，美国各农业机器公司的销货率比一年以前下降50％至80％。在许多地区的市场上，农业机器简直无人过问。农业机器的生产量已经大大缩减，有些工厂减产达一半。
    农业机器制造业的衰落，是同农业危机的恶化密切有关的。尽管在美国政府利用美“援”多方进行推销之下，农产品出口有了增加，但是美国政府积存的剩余农产品仍然有增无已，今春已经差不多达到九十亿美元，而去年年底是八十多亿美元，前年年底是七十多亿美元。去年美国的农民收入总额下降到106亿美元，比1954年少10％以上，比1947年少37％。虽然农产品价格在今年有些回升，但是农民的经济状况并没有好转。据五月一日“纽约时报”报道，美国农民今年春季时的现金收入比一年以前少7％。
    有迹象显示，下降的趋势还在向其它经济部门蔓延。
      抵消下降的因素
    当然，还不能说美国的经济已经开始了全面的衰退，因为美国经济中某些上升的因素仍然在起着抵消下降的作用。这主要是政府开支和企业固定资本投资的增加。
    美国政府（包括联邦、州和地方政府）的开支，在今年第一季达到年率785亿美元，这是朝鲜战争结束以来的最高峰。今年第二季，政府开支又增为年率786亿美元，比去年同期多二十四亿美元。联邦政府开支的大部分是所谓“安全”费用，每年在四百亿以上。
    今年，由于美国经济中出现了显著的下降趋势，艾森豪威尔政府顾不得答应要减少联邦开支的诺言，使得到六月三十日为止的1956财政年度联邦开支增加了十七亿美元（主要是因为增加了军备开支和农业补贴）。据美国报刊报道，1957财政年度的联邦开支将继续增加，这主要是因为增加军费和公共工程开支的缘故。
    政府开支的增加，固然可以刺激某些经济部门的生产，但另一方面却增加了人民的负担，削减了纳税人的购买力，从长远来说，对于有支付能力的社会总需求不会产生有利的影响。实质上，这主要地不过是一种依靠牺牲劳动人民利益来为垄断资本家维持最大利润的政策。
    私人投资的增加，在美国报刊上宣传得很多，被认为是“繁荣”的可靠基础。美国企业固定资本投资在今年第一季达到年率268亿美元，比去年第四季多5％，比去年同期多23％。据说美国企业界打算在今年进行的固定资本投资比去年的空前纪录还要多30％。
    固定资本的扩大，诚然能够在一定的时期内提高某些经济部门（主要是机器制造、厂房建筑和运输设备等）的生产和就业水平，但是另一方面在资本主义制度下劳动人民相对和绝对地贫困化的情况下，这却使社会生产力和购买力之间的矛盾更加扩大，使潜在的危机更加深刻。
    美国最近若干年来固定资本的迅速扩大，已经远远超出了市场需求的比例。美国“经济札记”所作的调查认为，早在1953年，美国工业设备的利用率就只有55％左右。美国工业设备的生产能力在1955年间比1950年朝鲜战争爆发时扩大了约50％。而去年美国的工业总产值，却只比1950年增加了约四分之一。显然，这种畸形的固定资本扩大，是不能无限地继续下去的。
    事实上，许多公司更新和扩充生产设备，是因为销售困难，必须改善技术和更新生产设备来进行激烈的竞争。例如汽车工业，从去年年底起就已经显现出严重的生产过剩，可是汽车工业却打算把今年的投资增加到比去年多一半。其中通用汽车公司宣布打算在今年用十亿美元来革新和添置生产设备（去年是六亿多美元）。
    扩大生产设备的公司，是把希望寄托在销售额的扩大上面的。然而事实上，在达到这个希望之前，滞销存货的增加和投资的扩大却已经使许多公司发生财政困难。连通用汽车公司、福特汽车公司和通用电气公司这样庞大的垄断组织，今年以来也用增发股票、发行债券和向银行借债等办法来筹措资金。因此，工商业债务总额迅速增加。美国联邦贮备局因而在今年四月不得不宣布把贴现率提高到3％，这已经是一年之内第五次宣布的收缩信用的措施了。
    由此可见，美国企业大规模扩大投资的计划，实际上具有很大的冒险性，而且不是没有遇到重大困难的。
    出口的增加在刺激美国某些工业部门的生产上也起了一些作用。今年头四个月，美国出口总额达到五十七亿多美元（内包括三亿八千八百六十万美元军用品），比去年同期多14％。不过，今后美国的出口是否还能够这样继续增加，是个问题。过去两年来，美国的出口一直在增加，这主要是因为西欧的工业扩充需要输入大量的美国工业装备和其它商品。然而，西欧的工业扩充同时也增大了西欧的竞争能力，反过来影响美国的出口。由于竞争已经日益剧烈，同时由于西欧的工业扩充最近已经开始停滞，目前美国经济界中已经有人预言美国的出口可能减少。
            前　景
    总而言之，今年上半年，美国的经济已经呈现出一个相当不稳的局面；虽然还有着一些上升的因素，但是下降的趋势还在逐渐发展。
    为了阻止或延缓下降的趋势，艾森豪威尔政府已经采取了一些新措施。例如在五、六月间，艾森豪威尔就曾先后签署了用政府补贴办法来缩减农业生产的农业法案和规定在十三年内用372亿美元来修筑公路的公共工程法案。七月间，众议院又通过了政府提出的用接受外币的支付办法来向国外倾销三十亿美元（比上年度多一倍）剩余农产品的法案。
    美国政府这些“预防危机”的经济措施，究竟有多大功效，将会被事实所证明。
