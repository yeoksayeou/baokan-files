Mr. Chairman, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:

It is a supreme honor for me to express the joy we feel in coming to the magnificent land of China. This joy is the joy of the delegation I lead, the joy of the Royal Lao Government, and the joy of all the Lao people. A country like ours being invited by the great People's Republic of China makes us feel deeply honored and respected. This is enough to explain with what impatient joy we accepted this invitation.

We are now at the central point of our journey. Everywhere we are receiving the courtesy and meticulous hospitality for which this country has been famous for thousands of years. The scenery, the cities, and the residents we have encountered make us more and more delighted. All of this is swirling in our minds like legendary pictures. In this rich and diverse civilization, strength and wisdom, ancient traditions and an unstoppable spirit of moving towards the future are intertwined and balanced so harmoniously. This civilization has a tremendous attraction for us, but it is difficult for us to explain. Today, being among you can be said to be the realization of a lifelong dream. We have not been disappointed in the slightest during this trip. I can even say that having seen today's China under construction, the image of China has expanded in our minds, become more vivid, and, if I may say so, more beautiful.

Mr. Chairman, your courteous hospitality, the warm care of the Chinese government, and the Chinese people's sympathy towards us, which flows so naturally, have directly touched our hearts. These memories will never be forgotten. Please accept my high and grateful respects.

The relationship between Laos and its great northern neighbor is not a recent occurrence. A thousand years ago, a branch of the Dai people left the southern border of China and entered the highlands of the Indochinese Peninsula. In the Mekong River Valley, the Lao people quickly established the Mong-Wa (transliteration) Kingdom and the Lan Xang Kingdom. Although they left China, they did not lose the profound influence of the Chinese people. Of course, influences from the sea, especially from India, slightly altered the characteristics of the original race, but the profound influence of China still exists. I firmly believe that the Kingdom of Laos was able to survive the turmoil of history because it conformed to the spirit of combining strength and gentleness, which has been and still is an unusually great factor in shaping China.

Despite the many geographical obstacles that separate the Mekong Basin and the Chinese border, there has always been a good neighborly relationship between China and Laos. In the Mekong River Valley, people still talk about how Lao envoys, unafraid of towering mountains and difficult roads, brought the loyal friendship of the Lao people every five, seven, or ten years all the way to the Chinese capital, where we are gathering again today.

Today it has been proven that the past relationship has never been interrupted. A whole century of historical changes produced a doubt, as if making people think that the Kingdom of Laos had certainly lost this gentle tradition of friendship. The broken links of the past have been re-welded today. I can say with certainty that during this wonderful trip, we have recognized the high value of this reconnected tradition.

Today's meeting is taking place in an era that is not very peaceful. In this era, propelled by new ideological trends and sometimes disturbed, the striving people of all countries are seeking a new balance and establishing confidence in a peaceful and prosperous future. We see that the People's Republic of China is striving for this with all its strength, and we are constantly admiring this vigor and confidence used to build the present and plan for the future.

Of course, geographical and ethnic conditions prevent the Kingdom of Laos from making such large-scale efforts. These conditions are constant factors in its history, but we cannot say that Laos is willing to be in a backward state because of this. Without a doubt, in terms of material strength, a country of three million people cannot be compared with its powerful neighbor, but true civilization is not simply built on material strength; it is fundamentally based on spiritual and moral values. This is not necessary to elaborate on for the ancient Chinese mainland. In this regard, I believe that the Kingdom of Laos is no less than any other country. The turmoil of history has not caused it to lose the spiritual source of civilization, nor has it eliminated the unwavering desire to live in dignity, independence, and freedom. The past ten years of war have not only not damaged this spiritual wealth, but on the contrary, have produced a new spirit. Because of this spirit, the Kingdom has been able to emerge in independence and unity as a country that recognizes its inherent responsibilities and demands to live in peace, freedom, and prosperity.

This irresistible trend that determines the destiny of the Lao people constitutes the cornerstone of the Lao government's policy. I am not prepared to elaborate on the program of action here, and these programs have been explained many times in the past. I want to state that our visit to China is completely in line with the correct course of this trend. Laos is willing to establish the most friendly relations with all its neighbors. The Lao people's deep love of peace naturally inclines them towards the strict neutrality that I often talk about. The geographical location of Laos does not allow it to participate in this or that group; it does not belong to any military alliance; it only asks to defend its independence and contribute to the various efforts made by people all over the world to establish peace. I firmly believe that no other people can understand the full reasons for our policy and the desire that prompts us to adopt this policy more profoundly than the Chinese people. The Lao people know that in achieving their above-mentioned goals, they can rely on the friendship and support of the Chinese people. This is the great hope that our trip has given us.

I raise my glass:

To the friendship between Laos and China!

To the good health of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China!

### 梭发那·富马首相在宴会上的讲话

专栏：

    梭发那·富马首相在宴会上的讲话主席先生阁下们、女士们、先生们：
    对于我们来到壮丽的中国土地所感到的喜悦加以表达，这对我来说是无上光荣。这种喜悦，是我所领导的代表团的喜悦，是老挝王国政府的喜悦，也是全体老挝人民的喜悦。像我们这样的国家受到伟大的中华人民共和国的邀请，我们深深感到荣幸和被尊重。这足以说明我们是以多么急不可待的喜悦接受这次邀请的。
    我们现在已经是在我们旅行的中心地点了。我们到处受到这种几千年来世界闻名的礼遇和体贴入微的款待，我们所见到的风景、城市和遇到的居民使我们愈来愈感到愉快。这一切正像传说中的图画一样在我们头脑中萦绕，在这种丰富多采和多种多样化的文明中，力量和明智、古老的传统和不可遏止的迈向将来的精神互相交织着而又如此和谐地得到平衡，对我们来说，这种文明对我们有着巨大的吸引力，但是我们很难加以说明。今日我们能置身于诸君中间在某种程度上可以说是实现了我们一生的梦想。在我们这次旅行中，我们丝毫没有感到失望，我甚至可以说，看到了在建设中的今天的中国，中国的形象在我们头脑中又扩大了，更生动了，并且如果可以这样说，更美丽了。
    主席先生，您的优礼的款待，中国政府亲切的关怀，以及中国人民对我们如此自然流露的同情直接打动了我们的心坎，这些回忆将是永远不能忘怀的，请您接受我的崇高的和感谢的敬礼。
    老挝和它的伟大的北方邻邦的关系不是最近才发生的事，一千年以前，一支傣族人民离开了中国南部边境从北方进入了印度支那半岛的高地，在湄公河谷，老挝人民很快就建立了蒙娃（译音）王国和兰生王国。他们固然是离开了中国，但是他们没有因此而失去了中国人民的深刻影响。当然，来自海上的影响，特别是来自印度的影响，略微改变了原始种族的特质，但是中国的深刻影响依旧存在着。我坚信老挝王国在历史的动荡中得以生存，是由于符合了刚柔并用的精神，而这种精神曾经是并且依旧是形成中国的异常伟大的因素。
    尽管有许多地理上的障碍隔离了湄公盆地和中国的边境，中国和老挝之间还是一直存在着善邻关系，在湄公河山谷，人们仍然谈论着，老挝的使节不怕丛山峻岭，路途艰难，每隔五年、七年或十年把老挝人民忠实的友谊一直带到了现在我们又在这里聚首的中国首都。
    今天已经证明，过去的关系从未中断，整整一世纪的历史变故产生了一种疑虑，仿佛使人认为老挝王国已经肯定地失去了这种温文儒雅的友谊传统。过去折断了的链环今天又重新焊接起来了，我肯定地说，在这次美好的旅行中，我们认识到了这个重新联系起来的传统的高度价值。
    今天的会见是处在不大平静的时代中，在这个时代里，为新的思想潮流的推动、有时受到纷扰的、奋发起来的各国人民正在寻找一个新的平衡，树立对一个和平和繁荣的未来的信心。我们看到中华人民共和国正在这方面全力争取，我们不停地赞赏着这种用以建设现在和策划将来的朝气和信心。
    当然，地理和种族的条件阻止了老挝王国作出如此大规模的努力，这些条件是它历史中不变的因素，但我们不能因此说，老挝愿意处在落后的状态。毫无疑问，在物质力量方面，一个三百万人口的国家是不能同它的强大邻国相比的，但是真正的文明并不是单纯建筑在物质力量上的，它基本上是建立在精神和道德的价值上的。这一点对于古老的中国大陆来讲，是不必烦言的。在这方面，我相信，老挝王国同任何国家相较亦无逊色。历史的动荡并没有使它失去文明的精神源泉，也没有使那种要求在尊严、独立和自由中生存的不可动摇的愿望消灭。刚刚过去的十年战争，不但没有损害这种精神财富，而且相反地产生了一种新的精神，由于这种精神，王国在独立和统一中能以一个认识到本身的天赋职责并要求在和平、自由和繁荣中生存的国家而出现。
    这股决定老挝人民命运的不可抗拒的潮流构成老挝政府政策的基石。我不准备在这里详细叙说行动的纲领，并且这些纲领过去已经多次说明了，我想说明一点，就是我们来中国的访问是和这股潮流的正确路线完全符合的。老挝愿意和它的一切邻国建立最友好的关系。老挝人民的那种深深爱好和平的气质使他们自然倾向于我经常所说的严格的中立。老挝的地理位置不允许它参加这个或那个集团；它不属于任何军事联盟，它只要求保卫它的独立，并在全世界人民为建立和平而作的各种努力中尽一部分力量。我深信没有其他人民能比中国人民更深刻地了解我们的政策的充分理由和促使采取这种政策的愿望。老挝人民知道，在实现他们上述的目标时，他们可以依靠中国人民的友谊和支持。这就是我们这次旅行所给与我们的巨大希望。
    我举杯：
    为老挝和中国两国间的友谊干杯！
    为中华人民共和国毛泽东主席的身体健康干杯！
