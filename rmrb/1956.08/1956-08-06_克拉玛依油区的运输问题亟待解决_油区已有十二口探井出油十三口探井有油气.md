Karamay Oilfield's Transportation Problems Urgently Need Solving
　　Twelve Exploratory Wells in the Oilfield are Producing Oil; Thirteen Exploratory Wells Show Oil and Gas
　　(Our newspaper's dispatch from Urumqi, August 5th) As of August 3rd, twelve exploratory wells in the Karamay Oilfield have already started producing crude oil, and thirteen exploratory wells show oil and gas. Among the thirteen exploratory wells showing oil and gas, one well in a very important location, after electrical logging, has been proven to have passed through six oil-bearing layers. The geological conditions are completely consistent with the already producing wells in Karamay, indicating that the oil-bearing area of the Karamay Oilfield has extended more than ten kilometers towards the Manas River bank.
　　Qin Feng, the person in charge of the Karamay Oilfield, told this newspaper's Urumqi correspondent on the 3rd: "Currently, the most pressing issue for developing the Karamay Oilfield is still transportation. The road from Dushanzi to Karamay has been widened, and it is only waiting for the laying of sand and gravel, but there are very few vehicles transporting sand and gravel, which has delayed the completion date of this road. In Urho, ninety kilometers away from Karamay, some exploratory wells have already started drilling, and some are about to start drilling. However, the road from Karamay to Urho has not yet started construction, and there are very few cars transporting equipment on this route. Originally, it was planned to divert water from Boketu to Karamay, but recent exploration has revealed that the water volume in Boketu is very small during the summer and autumn. Therefore, it is necessary to change to diverting water from the Manas River. However, the water pipes are still piled up in Zhen'ergos on the Sino-Soviet border. In just over two months, winter will arrive in Karamay, and the issue of winter protection is also very urgent. However, insulation equipment has not been settled to this day. Currently, Karamay is experiencing scorching heat, with daytime temperatures reaching as high as 45 degrees Celsius. The demand for drinking water has also increased, but the entire oilfield only has thirteen water trucks transporting water back and forth. Due to the temporary lack of industrial water supply, work has been forced to stop."
　　Comrade Qin Feng and Fan Zijiu, Deputy Manager of the Dushanzi Mining Bureau, have traveled back and forth between Karamay, Dushanzi, and Urumqi many times to negotiate for vehicles, but the transportation problem has not been completely resolved. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee has allocated 480 vehicles in succession, but because many of the vehicles are old and dilapidated, the attendance rate is not high. The Xinjiang Transportation Department recently sent people to Karamay to understand the transportation situation. It is said that it is currently impossible to allocate more vehicles. Is it really impossible to provide more vehicles to support the Karamay Oilfield? The reporter learned from relevant sources that among the 6,200-plus heavy-duty vehicles currently in Xinjiang, more than 1,000 vehicles are scattered among 146 units, with an average utilization rate of less than 40%. Among them, the utilization rate of the 2,400-plus vehicles of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Transportation Bureau is only 60%. Some units with vehicles are unwilling to participate in planned transportation and are unwilling to be centrally managed, secretly dispersing the vehicles, breaking them down into smaller units to reduce the target. Some units even violated laws and regulations by selling some vehicles privately to Qinghai Province Trading Company and Gansu Shandan Construction Company. Obviously, the current problem is not that there are no more vehicles that can be allocated to support Karamay, but that there is no plan or determination to raise funds for this urgent task. Therefore, this situation should immediately attract the serious attention of relevant parties.

### 克拉玛依油区的运输问题亟待解决  油区已有十二口探井出油十三口探井有油气

    克拉玛依油区的运输问题亟待解决
    油区已有十二口探井出油十三口探井有油气
    本报乌鲁木齐5日电　截至八月三日，克拉玛依油区已经有十二口探井喷出原油，十三口探井有油气显示。在有油气显示的十三口探井中，有一口位置很重要的探井，经过电测证明，已穿过了六个含油层，地层情况和克拉玛依已经喷油的各井完全相符，说明克拉玛依油区的储油面积又向玛纳斯河岸伸展了十多公里。
    克拉玛依油区的负责人秦峰三日向本报驻乌鲁木齐记者说：“当前开发克拉玛依油田最迫切的仍然是运输问题。从独山子到克拉玛依的公路，路面已经加宽，只等待铺砂石，但是运输砂石的车辆很少，延迟了这条公路的竣工日期。离克拉玛依九十公里的乌尔禾，有的探井已经开钻，有的即将开钻，但是从克拉玛依到乌尔禾的公路还没有动工，在这条线路上运送器材的汽车也寥寥无几。原先计划从博克图引水到克拉玛依，经最近探明，在夏秋之间，博克图的水量很小，因此要改引玛纳斯河的水。但是水管仍然堆积在中苏边境的震尔果斯。再过两个多月，冬天就要来到克拉玛依，冬防问题也是很紧迫的。但是保暖设备直到今天还没有着落。目前，克拉玛依正值酷暑，白昼气温高达摄氏四十五度，饮用的水也随着增加，但是全油区只有十三辆水车来回运水，由于工业用水一时供应不上，曾被迫停过工。
    秦峰同志和独山子矿务局副经理范子久，为了交涉车辆，曾多次来往克拉玛依、独山子和乌鲁木齐，但是运输问题并没有彻底解决。新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会先后调拨了四百八十辆汽车，因为许多汽车破旧，出勤率不高。新疆交通厅最近派人前往克拉玛依了解运输情况，据说，目前不可能再增拨车辆。是不是真的不能给克拉玛依油区增加车辆呢？记者从有关方面获悉：新疆现有的六千二百多辆载重汽车，其中一千几百辆分散在一百四十六个单位，平均利用率不到40％，其中新疆维吾尔自治区运输局的二千四百多辆汽车的利用率，也只有60％。有的有车的单位，既不愿参加计划运输，又不愿被集中管理，暗地里将车辆分散，化整为零，以缩小目标。有的单位竟违法乱纪，将一部分汽车，私自卖给青海省贸易公司和甘肃山丹建筑公司。显然，当前并不是调拨不出更多的车辆来支援克拉玛依，而是没有计划没有决心去筹措这项紧迫的工作。因此，这种情况应该立即引起有关方面的严重注意。
