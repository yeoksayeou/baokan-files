Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 4th: TASS reports: The Budapest Garrison Military Tribunal concluded the trial of imperialist spies Sandor Mezei and Lajos Bati, and ten accomplices, on August 3rd.

The court found the defendants guilty of betraying the motherland, engaging in espionage activities for imperialist spy agencies, and attempting to establish armed organizations to overthrow the Hungarian People's Democratic system. Defendants Mezei and Bati were recruited by imperialist spy agencies after fleeing Hungary to the West several years ago. They had illegally crossed the Hungarian border several times to carry out special missions. When they were arrested, automatic pistols, cameras, false documents, and maps were seized from them as material evidence.

As a result of the trial, the military court sentenced the ringleader, Sandor Mezei, to life imprisonment, and Lajos Bati to thirteen years imprisonment. The remaining defendants were sentenced to one to six years imprisonment respectively.
