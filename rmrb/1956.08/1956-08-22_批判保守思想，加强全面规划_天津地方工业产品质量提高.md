    This newspaper reports that since the beginning of this year, Tianjin's local industry has achieved relatively significant success in improving product quality and increasing new varieties and designs. Among 385 major products, 267 have shown improvement in physical properties compared to last year (not including those with good quality last year and little change this year). Among these 267 products, 91 have been well-received by trade departments and consumers due to significant improvements. For example, the lead wire produced by the Local State-Owned No. 1 Iron Wire Factory in the fourth quarter of last year had insufficient acid resistance, was too hard, easily broken, had uneven galvanization thickness, and a dull color, failing to meet export standards. This year, these problems have been eliminated, making it popular in Southeast Asia. The asphalt felt produced by the Local State-Owned Oil Felt Factory in the past could only prevent water leakage for four days during immersion tests and would melt at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. The current product can prevent water leakage for twelve days and does not melt at a temperature of 63 degrees Celsius. The typing wax paper produced by the Joint State-Private Yifeng Paper Mill in the past could only print 500 copies and was susceptible to cold and heat. The current product can print 1,500 copies and is resistant to both cold and heat. The naphthol red cloth produced by the Local State-Owned Weaving and Dyeing Factory in the past was prone to fading, had dull colors, and a rough surface. Now these shortcomings have been overcome, and it has been rated as a first-class product nationwide. In addition, vulcanized blue khaki, black tuxedo wool, baked floral overcoat wool, insulation products, baking soda, kraft paper, match paper, glazed paper, colored glazed paper, striped kraft paper, and ostrich ink have also been rated as first-class products nationwide.

    This year, Tianjin's local industry has also achieved better results in the trial production of new products and new designs than in any previous year. A total of more than 200 new varieties and designs were successfully trial-produced last year. This year, by the end of May alone, 302 types have already been successfully trial-produced, of which 188 have been put into production. Among the successfully trial-produced new varieties and designs, cellophane, painted cloth for car cushions, silk-cotton blended poplin, sprayed floral bed sheets, traditional Chinese jackets, printed velvet jackets, and canned prawns are all welcomed by the market.

    At the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party committee, the Tianjin local industrial system carried out a relatively thorough criticism of right-leaning conservative ideology from top to bottom and conscientiously formulated and implemented plans to improve product quality and increase varieties and designs. Various bureaus, companies, and directly affiliated factories have gradually formulated or revised product quality standards, established and improved inspection institutions and systems for finished and semi-finished products, increased inspection personnel, added inspection instruments, strengthened ties with universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions, established professional technical research groups, held various professional technical experience exchange meetings, and sent people to visit and study in other places.

    The work of Tianjin's local industry in improving product quality and increasing varieties and designs still has shortcomings. The quality of some products has not only failed to improve but has declined, the plan for the first-class product rate of many products has not been completed, and not enough attention has been paid to reducing costs. New products and new designs cannot be put into production quickly. These shortcomings need to be overcome in future work.

### 批判保守思想，加强全面规划  天津地方工业产品质量提高

    批判保守思想，加强全面规划
    天津地方工业产品质量提高
    本报讯　今年以来，天津市地方工业在提高产品质量，增加新品种新花色方面，都取得了比较显著的成就。在三百八十五种主要产品中，物理性能比去年有所提高的，已有二百六十七种（去年质量比较好，今年无多大变化的不计在内）。在这二百六十七种产品中，因改变得比较显著而得到贸易部门和消费者好评的有九十一种。如地方国营第一铁丝厂生产的铅线，在去年第四季度，耐酸度不够，太硬，容易断，镀锌厚薄不匀，色发乌，达不到出口标准。今年，这些毛病都没有了，因而畅销于南洋一带。地方国营油毡厂过去生产的沥青油毡，做浸水试验时，只能四天不漏水，在摄氏四十度的热度下就融化。现在生产的可以十二天不漏水，在摄氏六十三度的热度下不融化。公私合营益丰造纸厂过去生产的打字腊纸，只能打印五百份，怕冷又怕热。现在生产的可以打印一千五百份，不怕冷也不怕热。地方国营织染厂过去生产的纳夫妥红布，容易掉色，色不鲜，布面不光。现在这些缺点都已克服，被评为全国第一流产品。另外，还有琉化蓝卡其布、黑色礼服呢、烤花大衣呢、绝缘制品、小苏打、牛皮纸、火柴纸、有光纸、色有光纸、条纹牛皮纸、鸵鸟墨水等，也都已被评为全国第一流产品。
    今年，天津市地方工业的新产品、新花样的试制成绩，也比已往任何一年的都好。去年全年共试制成功的新品种新花样共二百多种，今年仅统计到五月底为止，就已试制成功了三百零二种，其中已投入生产的有一百八十八种。在试制成功的新品种新花样中，玻璃纸、做汽车坐垫用的漆布、丝棉混织的派立司、喷花床单、大襟绒衣、印花绒衣和对虾罐头等，都受到市场的欢迎。
    今年年初天津市地方工业系统在党委领导下，曾自上而下地开展了比较深入的对右倾保守思想的批判工作，并认真地制定和执行了关于改进产品质量，增加品种花样的规划。各局、公司和直属厂，都逐步制定或修改了产品质量标准，建立和健全成品和半成品的检验机构、制度，增加检验人员，加添检验仪器，加强同大学、专科学校、科学研究机关的连系，成立了专业技术研究组，召开各种专业技术经验交流会，派人到外地参观学习等。
    天津市地方工业的改进产品质量、增加品种花样的工作还有缺点。有些产品质量不仅没提高反而下降，不少产品的正品率计划没有完成，对降低成本注意得不够，新产品、新花样不能很快地投入生产。这些缺点，需要在今后的工作中加以克服。
