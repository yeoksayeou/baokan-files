Speech by Mayor Peng Zhen at the Welcome Rally of People from All Walks of Life in Beijing

Your Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma and all distinguished guests of the Lao Royal Government Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, are holding a meeting here to welcome our friendly and close neighbor, the Prime Minister of the Lao Royal Government, His Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the Lao Royal Government Delegation he leads, to visit our country. With great pleasure, I represent all the citizens of Beijing in expressing our heartfelt gratitude and warm welcome to your friendly visit, and through you, extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to the citizens of Vientiane, the capital of the Lao Kingdom, and the people of Laos.

China and Laos are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, close like relatives. There are no conflicting interests between our two peoples, but rather a long and deep friendship. Although the scourge of colonialism has hindered friendly exchanges between our two peoples for nearly a century, the friendship between the two peoples has remained deeply rooted in our hearts, and both of our countries have now proudly stood up after a long struggle for national independence. Although our two countries speak different languages and have different social systems, we both need a peaceful environment to build our own countries, we both cherish the common desire to develop friendly relations, and we both need to establish equal and solid friendly cooperative relations between our two countries. We welcome the satisfactory achievements made by the Lao Kingdom recently through the Vientiane Conference on the issue of domestic peaceful reunification, as well as Laos' determination to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. We are very pleased to see the emergence of a Lao Kingdom with peaceful reunification and great national unity in the south of our country. We congratulate the independence and unity of the Lao Kingdom and the great national unity of the Lao people, and we congratulate the growing development of the lasting friendship between our two countries.

Your Royal Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma and friends of the Lao Royal Government Delegation, we thank you for the friendship that your visit brings to the Chinese people, and we ask you to convey the friendship of the Chinese people to our respected Lao people. We firmly believe that through your visit, the friendly relations between our two countries will be further developed, and a new foundation will be laid for strengthening economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries.

We sincerely welcome you to take time during your visit to China to visit various aspects of work in Beijing, and we sincerely hope that you will give us your valuable comments.

I wish prosperity to the Lao Kingdom and happiness to its people!

I wish the friendly relations between China and Laos will develop day by day!

Long live peace in Asia and the world!
