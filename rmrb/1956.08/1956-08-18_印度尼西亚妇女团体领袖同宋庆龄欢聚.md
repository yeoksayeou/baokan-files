Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: Indonesian women's group leaders held a gathering in Jakarta on the afternoon of August 16th to welcome Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling.

At the welcoming meeting, Soong Ching Ling said: "We Asian-African women are particularly aware of the new atmosphere that is gradually becoming prevalent in the international climate. We welcome the restoration of calm and reason on the international stage. Thanks to the persistent struggle of millions of men and women, the idea of peaceful coexistence is gradually overcoming the brinkmanship of war by some hotheads. We women especially hate war and the destruction of life, property, and hope that it brings. We are disgusted by the thought that some people still believe that using force from a so-called 'position of strength' is the ultimate solution to outstanding issues. This situation presents women all over the world with the task of uniting more and more women so that we can force the governments of the world to seek peace."

She said: "The era of liberation has brought many decisive victories to our two countries. These victories, in turn, have become a powerful impetus for achieving the progress of women in our two countries. These victories illustrate that there is now a new Indonesia and a new China, and that new women have emerged in our two countries. Returning to the old days of suffering is impossible. Now, we can only move forward towards the prosperity and peace of our two countries and the full rights of our women. This is our demand to all mankind and to women all over the world. In this regard, I assure you that the 600 million Chinese people will work with you to realize the aspirations of our two countries and all countries in Asia and Africa, which together have created today's era of liberation."

Soong Ching Ling also answered questions raised by the Indonesian women leaders about the situation of women and children in China.

The welcoming meeting was presided over by the wife of Foreign Minister Abdulgani, and was attended by Mrs. Hatta, Mrs. Sastroamidjojo, Mrs. Wirjopranoto, Mrs. Suriadarma, Mrs. Sukanto, Mrs. Subandrio, Mrs. Santoso, Chairman of the Indonesian Women's Association, and other Indonesian women leaders. After the welcoming meeting, the Indonesian women leaders hosted a banquet in honor of Soong Ching Ling.

    印度尼西亚妇女团体领袖同宋庆龄欢聚
    据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚妇女团体的领袖们八月十六日下午在雅加达举行集会，欢迎宋庆龄副委员长。
    宋庆龄在欢迎会上说：“我们亚非妇女特别意识到在国际气候中逐渐普及的新气氛。我们欢迎在国际舞台上恢复了平静的理智。由于千百万男女的坚持斗争，和平共处的思想正在逐渐地战胜某些热昏头脑的人的战争边缘政策。我们妇女尤其憎恨战争和战争所带来的对生命、财产和希望的破坏。想到有些人仍然认为从所谓‘实力地位’来采用武力是对悬而未决的问题的最后解决办法，使我们感到反感。这种情况向全世界的妇女提出任务，要把越来越多的妇女团结起来以便我们能够迫使世界各国政府寻求和平。”
    她说：“解放的时代已经给我们两国带来了许多决定性的胜利。这些胜利反过来又成了实现我们两国妇女的进步的强大的推动力。这些胜利说明了，今天存在着一个新印度尼西亚和一个新中国，而且，在我们两国出现了新的女性。回到受苦难的旧时代是不可能了。现在只能够向我们两国的繁荣和和平以及我们妇女的充分权利迈进。这就是我们对全人类和全世界妇女的要求。在这一点上我向你们保证，六万万中国人民将同你们一起努力来实现我们两国和亚非所有国家的愿望，这些愿望汇合起来创造了今天的解放时代。”
    宋庆龄还答复了印度尼西亚妇女领袖们提出的关于中国妇女和儿童情况的问题。
    欢迎会由外交部长阿卜杜加尼的夫人主持，参加的有哈达夫人、沙斯特罗阿米佐约夫人、维约普拉诺托夫人、苏里亚达马夫人、苏坎托夫人、苏班德里奥夫人、印度尼西亚妇女联合会主席桑托索夫人和印度尼西亚其他妇女领袖。在欢迎会结束后，印度尼西亚妇女领袖设宴招待宋庆龄。
