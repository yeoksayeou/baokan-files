    "Seriousness" and "Eclecticism"
    Yuchi Kui
    The "Beijing Daily" discussed the special photographic effects in the movie "The Fairy Couple," which drew criticism from a reader, who essentially said that such "frivolity" would detract from the "high degree of seriousness" of the Party newspaper, and so on.
    The "seriousness" in the mind of this young reader is not something new, but has existed since ancient times. The Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty often scolded things like "indulging in pursuits that undermine ambition," forbidding people from studying any specific issues or pursuing any specific knowledge, believing that these "things" were dangerous and terrible, and would cause their precious "ambition" to be lost at the slightest touch. When they were "raising their hands and bowing low while talking about nature and destiny," they were indeed full of "high seriousness" from head to toe.
    But let's not talk about that. A better example is the dignified Second Master Jia Zheng of the Rongguo Mansion in "Dream of the Red Chamber." During the "Talent Test in the Grand View Garden," in front of his talented son Baoyu, he couldn't come up with a single line himself, and couldn't praise a single word of what Baoyu wrote. On the issue of evaluating the scenery of Daoxiang Village, he was even refuted by Baoyu until he was speechless and embarrassed on the spot. However, he insisted on putting on the airs of a "strict father," often shouting "Ignorant beast!" When he really couldn't deny something, he would "nod and say: 'Beast, beast! It can be said to be a glimpse of the leopard through a tube.'" to show "qualified affirmation," much like some people today often like to say "has certain advantages" or "has reached a certain level."
    Jia Zheng's "high degree of seriousness" is a suit of iron armor worn on a body of ignorance. Baoyu usually didn't dare to touch it easily under his accumulated power. But this time, he couldn't help himself, not only was every poem he wrote good, surpassing everyone else, but what angered Jia Zheng the most was that "he hadn't even done anything, but started discussing the merits and demerits of others," which supposedly "showed that he was a frivolous thing." In fact, he knew too much. From those few times "discussing the merits and demerits of others," it could be seen that he was truly proficient in poetry, lyrics, songs, the works of various philosophers, landscapes, flowers, birds, plants, insects, and fish, knowing everything and understanding everything, worthy of Xue Baochai's early comment: "Every day, he collects miscellaneous knowledge from all sides," although that was quite sarcastic. The more knowledge one has, the higher one's vision becomes, and the more one can compare and choose, the more敏锐 one's ability to distinguish beauty from ugliness and cleverness from clumsiness becomes. In this way, it is impossible not to think independently.
    "To be ignorant of one thing is the shame of a Confucian scholar." This is a very good ancient saying. Although we are not Confucian scholars, if we are ashamed of echoing the opinions of others, we must first be ashamed of being ignorant of one thing and diligently "collect miscellaneous knowledge from all sides." A "determination" that can be "lost" by "indulging in pursuits," let it be "lost" quickly! Jia Zheng-style "seriousness" will ultimately be embarrassed on the spot.

### “严肃”和“杂学”

    “严肃”和“杂学”
    尉迟葵
    “北京日报”谈了一下电影“天仙配”中的摄影特技，便招来一位读者的指责，大意是说，这样“玩弄趣味”，有碍于党报的“高度的严肃性”，云云。
    这位青年读者心目中的“严肃性，”并不是什么新东西，其实是古已有之了。宋代理学家们常常骂什么“玩物丧志”，不许人研究一切具体的问题，追求一切具体的知识，认为这些“物”都是危险可怕的东西，会使他们那个宝贝的“志”一触之下，丧失无余。当他们“高拱手低作揖而言性命”的时候，确是满身满脸都是“高度的严肃性”。
    但这个还不去说他。更好看的榜样，是“红楼梦”里那位堂堂荣国府二老爷贾政。“大观园试才题对额”的时候，当着他那个多才多艺的儿子宝玉的面前，自己是题不出一句，对宝玉所题的也不能赞一词，为了稻香村风景的评价问题，还被宝玉驳得张口结舌，当场出丑。可是他偏要摆足一副“严父”的架子，动辄“一声断喝：‘无知的畜生！’”实在无法抹煞的时候，便“点头道：‘畜生，畜生！可谓管窥蠡测矣。’”以示“有保留的肯定”之意，好像今天某些人常爱说的“有一定的优点”或是“具备了一定的水平”一样。
    贾政这种“高度的严肃性”，是穿在愚昧无知的身躯上的一件铁甲衣。宝玉平日在积威之下，是不敢轻易去碰的。可是这回，他却不能自己，不光是每题必好，高过众人，最触贾政之怒的，还是“他未曾做，先要议论人家的好歹”，据说这就“可见是个轻薄的东西”。实在他知道得太多，单从那几次“议论人家的好歹”当中，便见出他真是诗词歌赋，诸子百家，山水花鸟，草木虫鱼，无所不通，无所不晓，不愧薛宝钗早经给他下的评语：“每日家杂学旁收的”，尽管那是颇有讥讽的意思。所知既富，所见自高，可供较量抉择者越多，辨别妍媸区分巧拙的能力便越是敏锐。这样，虽欲不独立思考，不可得也。
    “一事不知，儒者之耻。”这是很好的古训。我们虽非儒者，但倘以人云亦云为羞，也还是先要以一事不知为耻，好好地“杂学旁收”一下。一“玩物”便会“丧”掉的“志”，赶快“丧”掉它吧！贾政式的“严肃性”，终究是会当场出丑的。
