Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 10th: At a recent symposium held by leading members of the Tianjin municipal branches of various democratic parties and prominent social figures, many emphasized that strengthening the united front work in grassroots units is a crucial link for further consolidating the united front in the future.

This symposium was convened at the invitation of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting lasted for three days and concluded on the 9th.

During the discussions, participants agreed that Tianjin has made significant achievements in implementing the united front policy in recent years, and the united front has been increasingly consolidated, which has played a significant role in ensuring the success of various socialist construction undertakings. At present, the implementation of the united front policy is generally better in municipal-level leading organs. However, many Communist Party cadres in grassroots units lack a correct understanding of the united front policy, resulting in many shortcomings. Some Party cadres do not adequately respect the opinions of non-Party members, preventing some non-Party members from smoothly exercising their functions and powers in their work. For example, when the Municipal Education Bureau assigns tasks to some schools, it does not go through the non-Party principals, but directly through full-time Party cadres. In some joint state-private enterprises, Party cadres do not adequately respect the opinions of private sector personnel, and some matters that private sector personnel need to know are not made known to them. In addition, a small number of Party cadres in some grassroots units tend to be self-righteous and arbitrarily express their opinions on scientific and academic issues that they do not understand. The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Nankai University, at a symposium, made conclusive remarks and mistakenly criticized some correct opinions raised by professors. Furthermore, Party cadres in some units provide little ideological assistance to non-Party members and underestimate their political progress. Some Party members only discuss policies and work with non-Party members, rarely engaging in heart-to-heart talks or discussing their lives.

In order to strengthen the united front work in grassroots units, participants at the symposium suggested that the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strengthen the education of Party members in grassroots units on the united front policy; and that Communist Party members closely connect with the masses. At the same time, Party organizations in grassroots units should also strengthen the ideological education of non-Party members and establish regular systems.

Wu Yannong, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Minister of the United Front Work Department, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the United Front Work Department, expressed sincere acceptance of the opinions put forward by everyone and made self-criticism of the shortcomings of the Municipal Party Committee and the United Front Work Department. He hoped that various democratic parties and people from all walks of life would frequently offer opinions on united front work in the future.

    天津各界人士举行座谈会提出意见
    加强基层单位的统一战线工作
    新华社天津10日电　天津市各民主党派地方组织的负责人和著名社会人士最近举行的一次座谈会上，许多人都强调提出：加强基层单位的统一战线工作，是今后进一步巩固统一战线的重要环节。
    这个座谈会是由中共天津市委员会统战部邀请举行的。会议开了三天，已经在九日结束。
    在座谈中，大家认为：几年来天津市贯彻执行统一战线政策有很大成绩，统一战线日益巩固，这对保证各项社会主义建设事业发挥了很大作用。目前，在市级领导机关中，统一战线政策贯彻执行情况一般较好。但许多基层单位的共产党员干部对统一战线政策缺乏正确认识，因此产生许多缺点。有些党员干部对党外人士的意见不够尊重，使有的党外人士在工作中不能顺利行使自己的职权。如市教育局向某些学校布置工作时，不通过非党员校长，而直接通过党的专职干部去布置，在某些公私合营企业中，党员干部对私方人员的意见不够尊重，有些需要私方人员知道的事也不让他们知道。还有某些基层单位的少数党员干部往往自以为是，对自己不懂的科学、学术问题，也随意发表意见。南开大学的党委副书记在一次座谈会上发表结论性的意见，对有的教授提出的正确意见也错误地加以批判。此外，有些单位的党员干部对党外人士思想帮助少，对党外人士政治上的进步估计不足。有些党员与党外人士只谈政策、工作，很少谈心，谈生活。
    为了加强基层单位的统一战线工作，座谈会上有人建议中共天津市委员会加强对基层单位中的党员进行统一战线政策教育；要求共产党员密切联系群众。同时，基层单位党的组织也要加强对党外人士的思想教育，并建立正常的制度。
    中共天津市委员会副书记兼统战部部长吴砚农在座谈会上代表中共天津市委员会和统战部对大家提出的意见表示诚恳接受，对市委和统战部的缺点进行了自我批评。他希望各民主党派和各界人士今后能够经常对统一战线工作提意见。
