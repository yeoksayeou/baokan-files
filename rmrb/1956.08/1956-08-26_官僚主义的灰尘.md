    Bureaucratic Dust
    Liu Dai
    Recently, the General Office of the State Council conducted an investigation, and I discovered some noteworthy examples from these investigative materials, even though they are just bits and pieces. They may seem like jokes, but they should raise serious concerns. These examples can remind us that state organs should regularly sweep away this bureaucratic dust.
        Endless Corrections
    When the State Statistical Bureau of the State Council issued the 1955 annual report, it was followed by three supplements and two revisions. With so many supplements and corrections, things still weren't right. The Central Handicraft Bureau of the State Council, which was related to this annual report, still felt that a thorough correction was necessary and immediately issued a notice correcting 312 items in the originally issued annual report. Surely that should be correct now, right? Wrong. Not long after, the original issuing unit carefully corrected it twice more. Naturally, it's good to correct errors as many times as necessary, but one should also consider how difficult it is for local areas to implement.
        One to Fifteen
    This year, the Ministry of Finance issued fifteen official documents in succession for the issuance of annual budget items. The first document issued the items; the second document notified that no further supplements would be issued, and if there weren't enough, they should be printed locally; the third document was a corrigendum because of typos; the fourth document was a supplementary regulation; then followed the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth documents, all for revising, revising, and revising again. What were the other five documents for? They were for explaining, explaining, and explaining again.
        Three Attempts, One Success
    Some official documents are truly strangely handled. For example, the Grain State Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Food issued three notices to convene a national conference. The first notice announced the date of the meeting; the second notice instructed the participants to bring materials; and then the third notice finally specified who would attend the meeting. Why was something that should have been done in one step done in three?
        Hindsight
    Generally, everyone knows to send out notices in advance, and there's absolutely no reason to send out hindsight notices. But strangely enough, it actually happened. The Ministry of Education and others jointly organized an inspection team that arrived in Nanjing on April 12th. However, the Ministry of Education didn't send a notice to the relevant units in Nanjing until April 14th, saying that the inspection team would arrive in Nanjing before April 10th.
        Shooting at Nothing
    Forwarding and introducing good experiences is indeed something that leading organs should do; but introducing them indiscriminately without considering the location and conditions is a waste of ink and paper! Even worse, it may cause adverse effects. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is originally unsuitable for planting citrus, but the Plant Protection Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture copied and sent the opinions on the prevention and control of Huanglongbing in Guangdong citrus and experimental research to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for reference. One wonders how the Ministry of Agriculture expects them to refer to it.
        Correcting the "Correction"
    If there are typos in official documents, issuing a corrigendum is a good method. However, the Ministry of Urban Construction discovered typos in a recently issued official document and issued a corrigendum. Unexpectedly, there were also "errors" in the corrigendum, so they had to issue a corrigendum to correct the corrigendum.
        Switching Day and Month
    Even elementary school students wouldn't mistake the character for "day" (日) for the character for "month" (月), but the typist typed it wrong, and the proofreader didn't catch it. The Ministry of Agriculture notified the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy to submit the award application materials completely within "May" (五月份内), but it was mistakenly typed as submitting them completely within "five days" (五日内). As a result, the cadres of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy were kept busy, having to work overtime and travel by car to various districts to verify the materials, fearing they would miss the deadline. A single character's difference can be very harmful.
        Empty
    One day, the Gansu Provincial Department of Health received a beautiful large envelope. Seeing that it was sent from the Ministry of Health in the capital, thousands of miles away, they were sure it contained an important official document. But when they opened it, it was empty. Such a careless style is truly laughable and exasperating!

### 官僚主义的灰尘

    官僚主义的灰尘
    刘岱
    最近，国务院秘书厅作了一次调查，我从这些调查材料中发现一些虽是点点滴滴的材料，但却是一些值得注意的事例。看起来好像是笑话，想起来却应该引起严重的警惕。这些事例可以提醒我们国家机关应该经常扫除这些官僚主义的灰尘。
        更正不止
    国务院国家统计局布置1955年年报，刚发下去，接着就发了三次补充，而且更改了两处。补充、更正了这样多，事情却没有妥贴；与这项年报有关的国务院中央手工业管理局还是认为非彻底更正不可，随即又下了个通知，把原来布置的年报内容更正了三百一十二处。这下总该没错了吧？不然。没多久，这个原发文单位又很细心地更正了两次。自然，改正错误是不怕千次百次的，但是也该想一想，地方上执行起来难也不难。
        一到十五
    今年财政部为了颁发年度预算科目，前后就连发了十五道公文。第一道公文是下达科目；第二道公文是通知不再补发，不够用的话由地方印制；第三道公文是发现了错字来了个勘误；第四道公文是作了个补充规定；接着又下了第五、第六、第七、第八、第九、第十道公文，都是为了修订、修订、再修订。还有五道公文为了什么呢？那就是解释、解释、再解释了。
      三举一得
    有些公文实在办得出奇，比如粮食部粮食国家监察局为了召开一个全国会议，连发了三次通知。第一次通知开会日期；第二次通知参加会议的人要携带材料；然后第三次通知才规定了那些人参加会议。为什么本该一次办的事要分三次办呢？
        马后炮式
    事先发通知，这事一般人都懂得的，绝没有应该发马后炮通知的道理。可是说也奇怪，竟然有之。教育部等共同组织了个视察组，于四月十二日已经到达南京，但是，教育部于四月十四日才给南京有关单位发出通知说，视察组将于四月十日前到达南京。
      无的放矢
    转发和介绍好的经验，的确是领导机关应做的事；但是不看地点和条件，乱介绍一通，岂不浪费笔墨纸张！尤有甚者，或将造成不良影响。内蒙古自治区本来不能种植柑桔，可是农业部植物保护局却把关于广东柑桔黄龙病防治和试验研究意见，抄送内蒙古自治区参考，不知农业部是要他们如何参考？
      “勘”勘误表
    公文有了错字，发勘误表更正是个好办法。但是城市建设部因发现刚发出的公文有错字，发了勘误表，谁知勘误表中也发生了“误”，只好又发了更正勘误表的勘误表。
      偷月换日
     “日”字和“月”字，小学生都不会认错，可是打字员打错了，校对员也没校出来。农业部通知天津市农林水利局将报奖材料在“五月份内”报齐，误打成“五日内”报齐；结果忙坏了天津市农林水利局的干部，他们只得加班加点，坐上汽车分头到各区去对证材料，恐怕误了限期。一字之差，害人不浅。
        空空如也
    甘肃省卫生厅有一天接到一个漂亮的大信封，一看是数千里外的卫生部由首都寄发的，必定其中有重要公文，谁知，打开一看，空空如也。这种粗枝大叶的作风真是令人哭笑不得！
