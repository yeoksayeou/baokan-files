    "Five Jin of Grain Deducted for Each Insult"
    Ding Jing
    The incident of "five jin of grain deducted for each insult" occurred at the Zhaizili Mine in Zibo, Shandong. In order to rectify labor discipline, the Zibo Zhaizili Mine had formulated many punishment measures, and "five jin of grain deducted for each insult" was just one of the punishment clauses.
    In the coal mine system, it is not an isolated case to specifically formulate punishment systems to punish workers. For example, the Ping'an Coal Mine's fine regulations include provisions such as "a fine of ten yuan for drinking alcohol in the mine" and "a fine of ten yuan for walking on the machinery." According to incomplete statistics, a total of eighty-six employees at the Ping'an Coal Mine were fined or disciplined in two months, with a total fine amount of one thousand two hundred and three yuan.
    The above are just the written fine regulations. As for the unwritten rules, where the leaders who enjoy punishing people temporarily consider and individually decide on fines, there are countless examples!
    This style of punishment has been opposed by many people, but some leaders are unwavering in their belief in the effectiveness of punishment. A section chief at the Jingxi Mining Bureau said: "Writing self-criticisms doesn't solve the problem; fines are needed to make workers pay attention and listen." A farm manager in Henan said to the workers: "Money is life, and life is your heart. Deducting your money is digging out your heart. See if you will work hard!" A leader at the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau said: Punishment is a magic weapon for completing tasks and consolidating labor discipline.
    All kinds of arguments boil down to this: Punishment is the most effective leadership method. Any complex problem, without the need for persuasion or education, to get through the ideology, can be solved by individual decisions or "according to the regulations" punishment.
    The serious consequences of the punishment style are the creation of antagonism between workers and leaders, the frustration of workers' enthusiasm and creativity in production, and the impact on the completion of production tasks. Therefore, wherever the wind of punishment prevails, it is also where the democratic atmosphere is the weakest, and where production management is the most chaotic. On the surface, they seem to have grasped the workers' "lifeline," and directly deducted a sum of money and grain from the accounting department. The punished people are also working there cautiously; however, the political and production losses caused by issuing orders and punishing actions, how can five jin of grain compensate for them!
    Here, it does not mean that enterprise management does not need any reward and punishment system. In order to maintain the labor discipline of the enterprise, in order to promote employees to consciously abide by labor discipline, in addition to mainly using persuasion and education methods, the internal reward and punishment system of the enterprise is also indispensable. However, the effectiveness of leadership can only be built on the basis of persuasion and education, not on the basis of punishment. Punishment is a last-resort form of education. For those who consistently violate labor discipline and repeatedly fail to reform after education, they must be given the punishment they deserve; otherwise, labor discipline cannot be maintained. However, it is really inappropriate to treat workers lightly with methods such as fines, demotions, and dismissals. For something like "insulting someone," instead of conducting criticism and education, but adopting the method of "deducting five jin of grain for each insult" is a simplistic and crude approach. In feudal society, there was the saying "a monarch's anger can pacify the world." Now, if we still bring out the old set to manage socialist enterprises and abuse punishment to maintain leadership, it will not work.

### “骂人一次扣粮五斤”

    “骂人一次扣粮五斤”
    丁井
    “骂人一次扣粮五斤”的事情发生在山东淄博寨里矿。淄博寨里矿为了整顿劳动纪律，曾经制定了许多惩罚办法，“骂人一次扣粮五斤”只是惩罚条款之一。
    在煤矿系统中像这样专门制定惩罚制度惩办工人的事情还不是个别的。例如：平安煤矿的罚款条例中就有“入井喝酒的罚十元”“在机器上走的罚十元”的规定。据不完全的统计：平安煤矿在两个月中被罚款和受处分的职工共有八十六人，罚款总数为一千二百零三元。
    以上，只是成文的罚规，至于没有明文规定，而完全由爱好惩办的领导者临时考虑、个人决定罚款的事，更是不胜枚举！
    这种惩办作风也曾遭到许多人反对，但是有些领导人却毫不动摇地迷信惩罚的效能：京西矿务局有个段长说：“光写检讨书不解决问题，罚款，才能使工人注意听话。”河南有个机械农场的场长对工人说：“钱就是命，命就是你们的心，扣你们的钱，就是挖你们的心，看你们可好好干活不！”双鸭山矿务局的一个领导人说：惩办是完成任务和巩固劳动纪律的法宝。
    各式各样的论调归结起来，就是：惩办主义是最有效的领导方法。任何复杂的问题，用不着说服教育，打通思想，只要个人决定或“照章”惩办，就可迎刃而解。
    惩办作风的严重后果，制造了工人同领导的对立，挫折了工人生产的积极性和创造性，影响了生产任务的完成。所以凡是惩办之风流行的地方，也是民主气氛最薄弱的地方，也是生产管理最混乱的地方。从表面上看，他们似乎掌握了工人的“命根子”，而且从会计科里直接扣下了一笔钱和粮，被惩罚的人也在那里谨小慎微地工作；然而，由于发号施令、惩办行事，在政治上和生产上造成的损失，岂是五斤粮食所能弥补！
    这里，并不意味着企业的管理不需要什么奖惩制度。为了维护企业的劳动纪律，为了促使职工自觉地遵守劳动纪律，除了主要采用说服教育的办法之外，企业内部的奖惩制度也是不可少的。不过，领导的效能只能建筑在说服教育的基础上，不能建筑在惩办的基础上，惩办是一种不得已的教育形式，对于一贯违犯劳动纪律而屡教不改的人，必须给予应得的惩处，不如此，就不能维护劳动纪律。但是，动辄就轻率地以罚款、降职、开除等办法来对待工人，这实在是不应该的事。像“骂人”的事，不去进行批评教育，却采取“骂人一次扣粮五斤”的办法，就是一种简单化的粗暴作法。在封建社会里，有“寡人一怒而安天下”的说法，现在，如果仍然搬出从前的一套来管理社会主义企业，滥用惩罚来维持领导，那是行不通的。
