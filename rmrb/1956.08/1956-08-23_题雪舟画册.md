    On Xue Zhou's Album of Paintings
    Guo Moruo
    In commemorating Xue Zhou, we cannot help but recall the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people that has lasted for over two thousand years.
    Xue Zhou's paintings are the crystallization of this national friendship in flesh and blood.
    By combining China's advanced experience with the actual conditions of Japan's mountains and rivers, Xue Zhou stood out in the art of painting.
    Xue Zhou once came to China, where he not only accepted Chinese painting methods but also came into contact with Chinese life and nature. When we appreciate his paintings, we do not feel that he is a guest from abroad.
    After the Meiji Restoration, we also learned a lot from Japan. Our Lu Xun once studied in Japan. We should affirm that Lu Xun's achievements were influenced by Japanese culture.
    Japanese friends are commemorating Lu Xun this year, and we are commemorating Xue Zhou this year. This tacit and beautiful sentiment will surely promote cultural exchange and friendship between the two countries on a new foundation.
    After the dark clouds pass, the moonlight is even brighter.

    题雪舟画册
    郭沫若
    纪念雪舟，我们不能不回忆到经历了两千多年的中日两国人民的兄弟般的友谊。
    雪舟的画就是这种民族友谊的血肉结晶。
    以中国的先进经验，结合了日本山川风物的实际，这就使雪舟在画艺中特出一头地。
    雪舟曾来中国，他不仅接受了中国的画法，并曾接触了中国的生活和自然。我们欣赏他的画，并不感觉得他是外来的宾客。
    明治维新以后，我们也从日本学习了不少的东西。我们的鲁迅就曾在日本留学。鲁迅的成就，我们应该肯定，是受了日本文化的影响的。
    日本朋友今年在纪念鲁迅，我们今年在纪念雪舟，这种不谋而合的优美的心情必将在新的基础之上促进两国之间的文化交流和人民友谊。
    乌云流过之后，月光是更加明朗了。
