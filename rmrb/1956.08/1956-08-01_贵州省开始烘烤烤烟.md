Xinhua News Agency News: The 600,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco planted in Guizhou Province this year has now begun to be harvested and cured. In Anshun Prefecture, the province's largest tobacco-producing area, more than 81,000 mu have started picking leaves for curing.

This year, the flue-cured tobacco in Guizhou Province is growing well, and the quality of the cured tobacco leaves is relatively high. The basal leaves cured by the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuli Township, Pingba County, generally reach grade 8, with the highest reaching grade 5. The basal leaves cured in Jiuzhi District, Guiding County, have more than 80% of the tobacco leaves rated as first-class, changing the phenomenon that they could not be graded in previous years.

This year, the planting area of flue-cured tobacco in Guizhou Province has increased by more than 90% compared with last year. In the process of planting flue-cured tobacco, all localities have paid attention to improving technology. Guiding, Zunyi, Xifeng, and Kaiyang counties, in addition to paying attention to sparsely sowing seeds and cultivating strong seedlings during sowing, have also widely promoted transplanting with soil and raising high ridges during the transplanting period. As a result, the tobacco leaves have grown vigorously and matured quickly. This year, the general curing period is ten days to half a month earlier than last year.

At present, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has transferred a group of cadres and organized more than 7,000 tobacco curing personnel to be sent to various places to guide farmers in tobacco curing work.

    贵州省开始烘烤烤烟
    新华社讯　贵州省今年种植的六十万亩烤烟，现在已经开始采摘烘烤。全省产烟最多的安顺专区，开始摘叶烘烤的有八万一千多亩。
    今年贵州省的烤烟由于生长较好，烤出的烟叶的质量都比较高。平坝县伍里乡五星农业生产合作社烘烤出的一千多斤脚叶烟，一般都达到八级，最高的达到五级。贵定县旧治区烤出的脚叶，列等的烟叶占80％以上，改变了往年不能评等级的现象。
    今年贵州省烤烟种植面积比去年扩大了90％以上。各地在种植烤烟过程中，都注意了改良技术。贵定、遵义、息烽和开阳等县，除了在播种时注意撒稀秧育壮苗外，在移栽期中又普遍推行了带土移栽和上高厢等方法，因而烟叶都生长得茁壮，成熟得也快。今年一般烘烤期都比去年提前了十天到半个月。
    目前，贵州省农林厅已调出一批干部和组织了七千多名烤烟烘烤人员分送各地，指导农民进行烤烟烘烤工作。
