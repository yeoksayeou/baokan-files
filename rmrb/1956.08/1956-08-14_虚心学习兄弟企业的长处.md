    Humbly Learn from the Strengths of Brother Enterprises
    The Liaoning Daily reported on August 9th that the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent 40 leading cadres to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn from their experience in developing the advanced producer movement. The two sides also established a friendship liaison system. It was determined that the ironmaking, casting, chemical, and machinery departments of both sides should maintain regular contact according to their specialties, exchange technical data and business work experience, and send each other technical monthly reports and special technical summaries on a regular basis. It was also determined that if one party needs to send people to the other party to study, the other party should provide as much convenience as possible in their work.
    On the same day, the Liaoning Daily published an editorial entitled "Humility is the Key to Progress" on this matter. The editorial said that the spirit of humbly learning from brother enterprises shown by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is worthy of great promotion in various enterprises in Liaoning Province.
    The editorial said that many leading cadres in Liaoning Province have developed complacency due to the fact that they started working in enterprises relatively early and have made some achievements in restoring and developing production. They overestimate their own achievements and those of their enterprises and are unwilling to learn from brother enterprises in Guannei (areas inside the Shanhaiguan Pass); some enterprises even take a long-term "big brother" attitude, turning their existing small achievements into burdens that prevent them from moving forward. In fact, compared with some brother enterprises in Guannei, there are many things that enterprises in Liaoning Province can humbly learn from. For example, in the textile industry, the average amount of cotton yarn consumed per thousand meters of cloth by the Tianjin Textile Bureau in 1955 was 128.87 kilograms, while the cotton textile factories in Liaoning Province required 141.35 kilograms. In the coal mining industry, the average overall efficiency of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Guannei in 1955 was 1.2107 metric tons, and the efficiency of production workers was 1.5127 metric tons, while the average overall efficiency of several coal mines in Liaoning Province was only 0.971 metric tons, and the production workers' efficiency was 1.182 metric tons. In the smelting industry, the amount of iron pipes required to refine one ton of copper in the reverberatory furnace of the Shenyang Smelting Plant has been reduced from more than 50 kilograms to about 10 kilograms in recent years, and the factory leaders believe that this is a remarkable achievement. However, brother factories only use 0.8 kilograms. These examples are all from units with the same nature and similar conditions. As for the quality of light industrial products being far inferior to that of brother enterprises in Guannei, this is an undeniable fact. The editorial said that since the production conditions are similar, if others can do it but we cannot, doesn't this prove that we have become complacent and lack strict requirements for our work? Therefore, it is very necessary to urge some leading cadres in enterprises in the province to overcome complacency and humbly learn from brother enterprises.
    The editorial concluded by saying that as long as we establish the spirit of humbly learning, it will not be difficult to find ways to learn. The kind of connection established between the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is a very good form of mutual assistance and mutual learning between enterprises. Production enterprises and construction enterprises need to establish such friendly connections, and production enterprises also need to establish such connections with commercial departments and transportation departments. In this way, expanding the principle of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and common improvement from individuals to enterprises can encourage and help all enterprises to move forward faster.

### 虚心学习兄弟企业的长处

    虚心学习兄弟企业的长处
    八月九日，辽宁日报报道：中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司派了四十名负责干部，到石景山钢铁厂学习有关开展先进生产者运动的经验。双方并建立了友谊联系制度。确定双方炼铁、铸造、化工、机械等部门，按专业经常取得联系，交换技术资料和业务工作经验，并按期互寄技术月报和专题技术总结。还确定，一方根据需要派人到对方学习时，对方应尽量给予工作上的方便。
    同日，辽宁日报就这件事以“虚心才能前进”为题，发表了一篇社论。社论说，鞍山钢铁公司这种虚心向兄弟企业学习的精神，在辽宁省各企业里是值得大大提倡的。
    社论说，辽宁省有不少企业领导干部，由于到企业里工作比较早，在恢复和发展生产方面做出了一些成绩。就滋长了骄傲自满情绪，过高地估计了自己的和本企业的成绩，不愿意向关内兄弟企业学习；有些企业甚至长期以老大自居，把已有的一点微小的成绩变成包袱，压着自己不能前进。事实上，如果和关内的一些兄弟企业比起来，值得辽宁省各企业虚心学习的地方是很多的。同是纺织工厂，天津纺织管理局1955年平均每千公尺布耗用棉纱数量是一百二十八点八七公斤，辽宁省的棉纺织厂却需要一百四十一点三五公斤。同是煤矿，关内的焦作煤矿1955年平均全员效率是一点二一零七公吨，生产工人效率是一点五一二七公吨，辽宁省几个煤矿平均全员效率只达零点九七一公吨，生产工人是一点一八二公吨。同是冶炼厂，沈阳冶炼厂反射炉炼一吨铜所需用的铁管，几年来由五十多公斤降低到十公斤左右，工厂领导上认为这已经是了不起的成绩了，可是兄弟工厂却只用零点八公斤。这些事例，都是性质相同，条件相差不多的单位。至于轻工业产品质量远不及关内兄弟企业，则更是人所共知的事实。社论说，生产条件既然差不多，别人能够做到的事情，我们不能做到，不正说明已经故步自封、对工作缺乏严格的要求了吗？所以，现在向本省一些企业领导干部提出克服自满情绪，虚心向兄弟企业学习，是非常必要的。
    社论最后说，只要树立起虚心学习的精神，就不难找到学习的途径。像鞍山钢铁公司和石景山钢铁厂建立的那种联系，就是企业之间互助互学的一种很好形式。生产企业之间、建筑企业之间需要建立这样的友谊联系，生产企业和商业部门、生产企业和交通运输部门也需要建立这样的联系。这样，把互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的原则，从个人之间扩大到企业之间去，就可以鼓舞和帮助各个企业更快地前进。
