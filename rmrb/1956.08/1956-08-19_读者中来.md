	Why Abolish Our Club?

	Our grassroots committee of the Jiangxi Fengcheng County Trading Company's commercial trade union has over 260 employees, and in the past, there were very few cultural and sports activities. So, all the employees did was work and sleep.

	In June of this year, the higher-level trade union asked our grassroots trade union to establish a club and allocated 300 yuan as the cost of establishing the club. We also received support from the administration and rented some houses in a location where employees lived relatively close together. We used our spare time to tidy up and decorate the houses in just over half a month and added some cultural and sports equipment. After the club opened, many employees went there to play every day, and even elderly employees who never used to go out would come to the club to play chess and read the newspaper.

	But just as everyone had a place to play, the Fengcheng County commercial administrative department, the "Commercial Bureau," wanted to abolish the club, saying that it wanted to allocate it to other companies as a storefront and that the club could not be located on the main street. We disagree with getting rid of our club. Jian Xia

	Hope Theaters Will Adopt Mobile Ticketing Methods

	Recently, the Beijing "Dazhong Theater" often has mobile ticketing groups coming to our organization to sell tickets. This method is very helpful in solving the difficulty of individual employees buying theater tickets. I hope other theaters can also adopt this ticketing method. Du Kezhen

    为什么要撤消我们的俱乐部
    我们商业工会江西丰城县贸易公司基层委员会有二百六十多个职工，过去很少文娱体育活动。所以全体职工除了工作就是睡觉。
    今年六月间，上级工会要我们基层工会成立一个俱乐部，并拨了三百元作为建立俱乐部的费用，我们也得到了行政的支持，在职工居住较为集中的地点，租到了一些房子。我们利用业余时间，在半个多月内，把房子整理布置好了，并添置了一些文娱体育设备。俱乐部开幕后，每天都有很多职工在那里玩，连过去从不出门的老年职工，也到俱乐部下棋和阅报。
    但是当大家刚有一个玩的地方的时候，丰城县的商业行政部门“商业局”却要把俱乐部撤消，说是要拨给其他公司做门市部，又说俱乐部不能设在大街上。我们不同意搞掉我们的俱乐部。　剑霞
    希望剧场都采用流动售票办法
    最近北京“大众剧场”常有流动售票组到我们机关来售票。这种办法很能够解决职工个人买戏票的困难。我希望其它剧场也能采用这种售票法。　杜可桢
