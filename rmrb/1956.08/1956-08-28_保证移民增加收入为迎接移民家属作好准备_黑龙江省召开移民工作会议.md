    Ensure Increased Income for Immigrants and Prepare for the Arrival of Immigrant Families
    Heilongjiang Province Holds Immigration Work Conference
    (Our Newspaper) In order to further improve immigration work, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee convened a conference of cadres responsible for immigration work from various administrative offices, cities, counties, and relevant provincial departments in early August. The meeting summarized the work of receiving and settling immigrants this year, and based on the instructions of the central government and the actual conditions of the province, determined the tasks of immigration work for the second half of this year and next year.
    This spring, Heilongjiang Province received a total of 143,698 households, totaling 260,164 people, from Shandong, Henan, Hebei and other places, including 100,7769 young reclamation team members. During this period, although due to the lack of extensive experience in receiving and settling immigrants, insufficient preparations, and other reasons, the emotions of some immigrants were unstable, and some returned to their original residences, the immigration work this year has achieved remarkable achievements due to the correct leadership and support of the central government, the close cooperation of brother provinces, and the support of the broad masses of the people in the province. The vast majority of immigrants were full of enthusiasm after arriving at their resettlement areas. They overcame various difficulties such as poor living and eating conditions, cold natural climate, and acclimatization, and developed the noble qualities of loving the motherland and loving labor in "marching towards the wasteland and building the frontier of the motherland", using their hands to establish 452 new villages on the boundless wilderness, and building 13,485 new houses. At the same time, they also actively engaged in production. This year alone, the young reclamation team members planted 130,000 hectares of food and potato crops such as soybeans, corn, millet, and potatoes, with an average of 1.2 hectares (equivalent to 18 mu) per person. In addition, each new village also planted enough vegetables, melons, yellow tobacco, hemp, etc., and universally carried out sideline production such as raising pigs, raising chickens, cutting sheep grass, digging medicinal materials, and engaging in transportation. It is estimated that these immigrants will increase the country's grain production by about 150,000 tons this year, and the cultivated area can be expanded in the future.
    Based on the above situation, the future immigration work tasks determined by the meeting are: to do a good job in consolidating the existing immigrants, basically complete the task of receiving family members, and at the same time prepare for the continued immigration in 1958. Therefore, it is required that the people's committees at all levels effectively lead the agricultural and sideline production of immigrants. In general areas, it is necessary to ensure that each young reclamation team member increases their income, and the income of immigrants with family members should generally not be less than the income level of local members. The meeting also determined to call on young reclamation team members to actively produce and seize the opportunity to build houses. Strive to move family members in batches this autumn, next spring, or next autumn.
    In addition, the meeting also arranged for doing a good job in providing production and living services for immigrants, adjusting immigration funding indicators, and arranging for immigrants to spend the winter.
    After discussion, the participants unanimously believed that resolutely implementing the national policy of planned reclamation of arable wasteland and prepared and organized reception and settlement of immigrants is very correct and feasible. Everyone expressed their confidence in doing this work well.

    保证移民增加收入为迎接移民家属作好准备
    黑龙江省召开移民工作会议
    本报讯　为了进一步做好移民工作，黑龙江省人民委员会于8月上旬召集了各专署、市、县和省有关部门负责移民工作干部会议。会议总结了今年的接收与安置移民的工作，并且根据中央的指示与本省实际情况，确定了今年下半年和明年的移民工作任务。
    黑龙江省今年春季由山东、河南、河北等地共接收移民十四万三千六百九十八户，共二十六万零一百六十四人，其中有青年垦荒队员十万零七千七百六十九人。在这个期间，虽然由于缺乏大量接收和安置移民的经验，准备工作作得不充分等原因，使部分移民情绪不稳，发生了一些返籍事情。但是由于中央的正确领导和支持，兄弟省的密切配合和全省广大人民群众的支援，今年的移民工作还是取得了显著的成就。绝大多数移民到安置地区后，情绪都是饱满的。他们克服了居住、饮食条件差，自然气候冷，水土不服等种种困难，发扬了“向荒地进军，建设祖国边疆”的爱祖国、爱劳动的高尚品德，用双手在一望无边的荒原上建立起了四百五十二个新村，建设了一万三千四百八十五间新的住宅，同时，他们也积极地投入了生产。单是青年垦荒队员今年就播种了大豆、苞米、谷子、土豆等粮薯作物十三万公顷，平均每人种了一点二公顷（折合十八市亩）。另外，每个新村还种植足够的蔬菜、甜瓜、黄烟、大麻等，并且普遍地开展了养猪、养鸡和割羊草、挖药材、搞运输等副业生产。预计这些移民今年将为国家增产粮食十五万吨左右，以后还可以扩大耕地面积。
    根据上述情况，会议确定的今后的移民工作任务是：做好现有移民的巩固工作，并基本完成接家属的任务，同时为1958年继续移民作好准备。因此，要求各级人民委员会切实领导好移民的农副业生产，一般地区要保证每个青年垦荒队员增加收入，带家属的移民，一般不能少于当地社员的收入水平。会议并确定，号召青年垦荒队员积极生产，抓紧时机盖房子。争取在今秋、明春或明秋把家属分批搬来。
    此外，会议还部署了做好为移民生产、生活服务工作和调整移民经费指标，以及安排移民过冬等问题。
    经过讨论，与会人员一致认为，坚决贯彻国家有计划的开垦宜耕荒地，有准备有组织的接收和安置移民的方针，是十分正确的、可行的。大家表示有信心把这个工作作好。
