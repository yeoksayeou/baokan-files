    Why the Decline in Indigenous Paper Production?
    Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, is a region characterized by abundant mountains, a large population, and limited arable land. Farmers there have a long-standing tradition of engaging in diversified economic activities, particularly indigenous paper production, which is not only historically significant but also widespread.

    However, starting in 1953, the county's output of indigenous paper has declined annually. In 1952, the value of indigenous paper production accounted for 41.24% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production in the county. This percentage has decreased each year since, and the quality of the paper has also deteriorated.

    Why has indigenous paper production in Fuyang County declined year after year? Besides certain objective reasons, the primary factor is the county leadership's one-sided emphasis on grain production, which has led to a neglect of guidance for indigenous paper production. For example, during the movement for exceeding grain production quotas in 1954, cadres put forward the erroneous slogan to farmers: "Grow what you eat, don't grow grain and eat bamboo (raw material for indigenous paper)." Because of the fear of "eating bamboo," farmers recklessly cut down *Shi* bamboo and *Mao* bamboo forests to plant corn. According to county statistics, a total of 18 million *jin* of bamboo was felled across the county, resulting in a shortage of raw materials for indigenous paper. In addition, unreasonable wages, untimely material supply, and insufficient funds have also hindered the development of indigenous paper production.

    At the county Party congress, representatives severely criticized the one-sidedness of the county leadership's production efforts. The county leadership also expressed its determination to change, but to date, the above situation has not seen any major improvements. It is hoped that relevant departments will resolve to change this unsatisfactory situation.

    A Section Chief Who Deliberately Creates Trouble
    In order to increase the income of its members, the Jianshe First Agricultural Cooperative of Qianchang Township, Jingshan County, Hubei Province, decided to assign two members to make tofu. They heard that the Wuling Tax Office stipulated that agricultural cooperatives must obtain approval from the tax office to sell tofu, so they sent someone to the tax office to complete the procedures. The people at the tax office said, "Verbal applications are not acceptable; you must submit a written application." The second time, they submitted a written application, but the people at the tax office said, "The writing is not neat; it's no good." The third time, they said, "You shouldn't use letter paper." The fourth time, they complained that "the application paper is too small." After four consecutive attempts without receiving approval from the tax office, the cooperative members became very anxious. Wang Shishang, a member of the cooperative management committee, personally went to the tax office to negotiate with Section Chief Peng. As soon as Section Chief Peng saw Wang Shishang come to his office, he glared at him and shouted without rhyme or reason, "Opening a business without completing the application procedures is illegal! How dare you disobey the laws of the country!" He also said, "Hmph! If I don't approve it, you can't do anything!" Wang Shishang didn't know what to do and was so angry that he couldn't speak. Many farmers were standing at the entrance of the tax office. After hearing Section Chief Peng's words, they angrily discussed, "This section chief isn't serving the people; he's deliberately creating trouble for the masses!"

    Why are Piglets Not Allowed to Leave the Area?
    After a bumper spring harvest, the enthusiasm of members of the Zhukeng Village Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yangtang Township, Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, for raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer greatly increased. The cooperative sent members to buy 19 piglets in the Tashiqu area of ​​neighboring Longyou County. When they passed through the Mohuan District of Longyou County on their way back to the cooperative, they were forcibly detained by cadres from the Livestock Trading Service Station of the district's supply and marketing cooperative. They scolded the farmers who bought the piglets, calling them piglet traders, and forced the farmers to sell the piglets at reduced prices locally, forbidding them from leaving the area. As a result, the farmers who purchased the piglets traveled back and forth in vain, wasting manpower and time, and losing more than one hundred yuan. I believe that the Longyou County Mohuan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative's practice of blocking and detaining piglets and forbidding them from leaving the area is wrong. It is hoped that relevant leading departments will investigate and correct this.

    Don't Eat Apricot Kernels Casually
    In Shuikouzi Village, Luojiatai Township, Yanqing County, Hebei Province, we saw piles and piles of sweet apricot kernel shells under the apricot trees. The apricot harvest in these areas has been very good this year, but because the apricot trees have been incorporated into the cooperative and there is no one to manage them, some members eat them under the trees at will while grazing or hoeing.

    Apricot kernels are national export goods; in China, a *jin* of high-quality sweet apricot kernels can sell for more than 1.20 yuan. Therefore, it is recommended that apricot kernel-producing areas pay attention, help agricultural cooperatives with apricot trees, and do a good job in the management and harvesting of apricot kernels. Do not throw away apricot kernels or eat apricot kernels at will.

    打破发展副业生产的障碍
    土纸生产为什么下降
    浙江富阳县是一个山多、人多、田地少的地区，农民素有多种经营的习惯，特别是土纸生产，不仅历史悠久，而且甚为普遍。
    但是，从1953年开始，这个县土纸产量便逐年下降。1952年全县土纸生产的产值占农副业总产值的41.24％，以后逐年下降，同时，土纸的质量也不断下降。
    富阳县的土纸为什么逐年下降呢？除了某些客观原因之外，主要是该县领导上片面地强调粮食生产，忽视了对土纸生产的领导。如在1954年粮食超额增产运动中，干部向农民提出“种什么吃什么，不种粮食去吃竹（土纸原料）”的错误口号，农民因怕吃竹，而将石竹园、毛竹园等大肆砍伐，改种玉米。据县委统计，全县砍掉竹子达一千八百万斤，因而土纸原料缺乏了。此外如工资不合理，办料不及时，资金不足等，也都妨碍了土纸生产的发展。
    在全县党代会上，代表们对县委领导生产上的片面性提出了严格的批评，县领导上也有决心改变，但是到目前为止，上述状况未见有什么大的改变。希望有关部门下决心来改变这种令人不满的状况。

    专门找麻烦的所长
    湖北省京山县钱场乡建设第一农业社为了增加社员的收入，决定分出两个社员磨豆腐。他们听说吴岭税务所规定农业社磨豆腐卖必须经过税务所批准，便派人到税务所办理手续。税务所的人说：“用口头申请不行，必须写申请书。”第二次他们写了书面申请送去，税务所的人又说：“字写得不规矩，不行。”第三次又说：“不应该用信笺纸写。”第四次又嫌“申请的纸小了。”接连四次没得到税务所的批准，社员们非常焦急。社务委员王世汤便亲自到税务所和彭所长交涉。彭所长一见王世汤找上门来，他瞪着眼睛，不分皂白地厉声说：“不办妥申请手续想开业，那是违法的！你们敢不遵守国家的法令！”又说：“哼！我不批准，你们搞个屁！”王世汤不知如何是好，气得说不出话来。税务所门口站了许多农民，他们听了彭所长的话，都气愤地议论说：这个所长哪里是为人民服务，专门给群众找麻烦！

    为什么不准小猪出境
    浙江兰溪县杨塘乡朱坑村第二农业生产合作社，在春花丰收后，社员养猪积肥的积极性大大提高，社里便派社员前往邻区龙游县塔石区一带购买了小猪十九头。回社时路过龙游县模环区，却被该区供销社牲畜交易服务所的干部强制扣留住了。他们把买小猪的农民辱骂了一顿，说他们是小猪商贩，强迫农民在当地减价拍卖，不准出境，以致使采购小猪的农民徒劳往返，浪费人力、时间，并损失了一百多元。我认为龙游县模环区供销社这种拦路扣留，不准小猪出境的做法是错误的。希望有关领导部门检查纠正。　　　　　　　　　毛景新
    不要随便吃杏仁
    我们在河北省延庆县罗家台乡水口子村，看到在杏树下边砸的甜杏仁皮一堆一堆的。这些地区今年杏的收成很好，可是由于杏树入了社，社里没有专人管理，有的社员在放牧、锄地的时候就任意在树下砸着吃。
    杏仁是国家出口的物资；在国内一斤上等甜杏仁也能卖一元二角多，因此建议产杏仁的地区加以注意，帮助有杏核的农业社，把杏核的管理、摘收工作做好，不要任意扔掉杏核或吃掉杏仁。
