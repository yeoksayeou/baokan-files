Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 3rd: According to Jakarta's "People's Daily" on August 1, in a report delivered at the Fourth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia on July 31, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, Aidit, put forward the Communist Party of Indonesia's general program and current demands in the current situation. The title of his report was: "Unite to Strive to Realize the Demands of the August 1945 Revolution."

Aidit said that in order to strive for the thorough realization of the demands of the August Revolution, to completely eliminate the influence of imperialism and feudalism, and to build an independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Indonesia, the Communist Party of Indonesia has put forward a common program to consult with parties and social strata that also oppose imperialism and feudalism and hope to realize the demands of the August Revolution. The common program is divided into two parts: the general program (which remains unchanged during the long period when the demands of the August Revolution have not yet been fully realized) and the current demands.

The current demands put forward by Aidit advocate mobilizing and uniting all forces of the country to strive for greater economic independence, recover West Irian, and defend peace in Asia and the world; thwart the anti-communist, anti-unity, and autocratic policies of some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, in order to establish a national coalition government composed of the four major parties of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Masyumi Party, the Nahdlatul Ulama, and the Communist Party of Indonesia, as well as other parties; and draft a constitution that conforms to the spirit of the August 1945 Revolution, etc.

The Communist Party of Indonesia also calls for the implementation of a foreign policy that strives for world peace, fulfills the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and opposes any attempt to drag Indonesia into any war bloc; in the interests of Indonesia, expand economic and cultural relations with other countries, regardless of their social system, and completely abolish the embargo against China.

The general program of the Communist Party of Indonesia put forward by Aidit advocates that Indonesia's national institutions should be a united front state based on the people and aimed at complete independence. In such a country, all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces can unite. Only by establishing a people's democratic regime is it possible to end the rule of landlords and comprador capitalists in Indonesia and begin a new stage in the history of the people's progress. The policies of the People's Government must be aimed at eliminating the influence of imperialism in all aspects and eliminating feudal oppression.

Aidit said, "We do not agree to replace the rule of foreign imperialists and landlords with the rule of the domestic bourgeoisie. We believe that all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes should participate in the regime. We advocate a united front political system."

Aidit added that what should be opposed is not national enterprise but the economy of imperialism and feudalism. Communists will undoubtedly focus on establishing a state-owned economy and helping the people's individual economy. National capitalists should be protected and helped. Land should be distributed to peasants.

Aidit said that the Communists of Indonesia believe that only on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance and under the leadership of the working class can the united front be consolidated. In the current period, the land policy of the Communist Party of Indonesia is to reduce land rent and loan interest. It does not demand the confiscation of landlords' land and its distribution to peasants.

Aidit continued that the Communist Party of Indonesia is currently fighting for a national coalition government, which is a more progressive government belonging to the category of old democracy, in which the Communist Party participates.

Due to the stubborn policies of some leaders of the Masyumi Party, the Communist Party of Indonesia did not participate in the current government. However, in general, the Communist Party of Indonesia supports the progressive program of the current cabinet. The Communist Party supports the cabinet so that it can implement the progressive elements in its program.

Aidit said that if the government has a program that represents the interests of the people and has the participation of all revolutionary classes, this government can be called a national coalition government. Aidit emphasized that the participation of several representatives of the Communist Party in the government does not change the nature of this old democratic government. At present, the Communist Party of Indonesia only demands the establishment of an old democratic coalition government, but according to the general program of the Communist Party of Indonesia, its goal is to establish a new democratic coalition government in the future.

If it were up to the Communist Party to decide, the best way to transition to the people's democracy—the preparatory stage for socialism—is through peaceful parliamentary struggle. But the Communist Party must be vigilant against the reactionary's malicious conspiracies. Aidit also emphasized that it is inappropriate to talk about the possibility of transitioning to people's democracy or socialism when the political leadership of the government is still in the hands of capitalists or even landlords and compradors.

In his report, Aidit reiterated the Communist Party's policy of developing progressive forces, uniting intermediate forces, and isolating stubborn forces.

Aidit pointed out that Indonesia now enjoys the most favorable position in international politics, which enables it to make more contributions to the cause of peace. He said that the current task of the Communist Party of Indonesia is to promote Indonesia to adopt a more active anti-colonial policy and a policy of striving for peace, in order to strengthen Indonesia's position in the world, especially in Asian and African countries. At the same time, the Communist Party must strive to use Indonesia's favorable international position to serve the interests of the Indonesian people, especially in the struggle to eradicate the economic influence of Dutch big capitalists in Indonesia.

Aidit said that the Communist Party of Indonesia will tirelessly work for the united front. He said that the Communist Party of Indonesia respects President Sukarno's slogan about cooperation between religious figures, nationalists, and communists.

    在印度尼西亚共产党中央扩大全会上
    艾地提出建立统一战线的共同纲领
    主张团结国家一切力量争取成立民族联合政府
    新华社雅加达3日电　据雅加达“人民日报”八月一日报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地七月三十一日在印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第四次扩大全体会议上作的报告中，提出了印度尼西亚共产党在目前局势下的总纲领和当前的要求。他的报告的题目是：“团结起来争取实现1945年8月革命的要求”。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党为了争取彻底实现八月革命的要求，为了完全铲除帝国主义和封建主义的影响，并且建设独立、民主、统一的繁荣的印度尼西亚，提出了共同纲领来同那些同样反对帝国主义和封建主义并且希望实现八月革命要求的党派和社会阶层进行磋商。共同纲领分为两部分：总纲领（它在八月革命的要求还没有完全实现的长时期内保持不变）和当前的要求。
    艾地提出的当前的要求中主张动员和团结国家的一切力量，为取得更大的经济独立、收复西伊里安和保卫亚洲和世界的和平而努力；挫败马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的某些领袖的反共、反团结和专制的政策，以便成立由印度尼西亚国民党、马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会和印度尼西亚共产党四大党以及其他党派参加的民族联合政府；拟订符合1945年8月革命精神的宪法等。
    印度尼西亚共产党还要求执行争取世界和平的外交政策，履行亚非会议的决议，反对把印度尼西亚拖入任何战争集团的任何企图；为了印度尼西亚的利益，扩大同其他国家之间的经济和文化关系，不论它的社会制度如何，并且全部废止对中国的禁运。
    艾地提出的印度尼西亚共产党总纲领主张印度尼西亚的国家机构应该是以人民为基础，以完全的独立为目的的统一战线国家。在这种国家内，一切反帝国主义反封建力量可以团结起来。只有建立人民民主政权，才有可能结束地主和买办资本家在印度尼西亚的统治，开始人民进步历史中的新阶段。人民政府的政策必须以铲除帝国主义在各方面的影响并且消灭封建压迫为目的。
    艾地说，“我们不同意以国内资产阶级的统治代替外国帝国主义者和地主的统治。我们认为，一切反帝国主义和反封建主义的阶级，都应该参加政权。我们主张统一战线的政治制度。”
    艾地又说，所要反对的不是民族企业而是帝国主义和封建主义的经济。共产党人将毫无疑问地着重建立国营经济并且帮助人民的个体经济。民族资本家应该受到保护和帮助。应该把土地分配给农民。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党人相信，只有以工农联盟为基础并且在工人阶级的领导下，统一战线才能够巩固。在目前时期，印度尼西亚共产党的土地政策是削减地租和贷款利息。它并不要求把地主的土地没收来分给农民。
    艾地接着说，印度尼西亚共产党目前正在为民族联合政府而斗争，这种政府是属于旧民主主义范畴的比较进步的政府，其中有共产党参加。
    由于马斯友美党的某些领袖的顽固的政策，印度尼西亚共产党没有参加目前的政府。然而一般来说，印度尼西亚共产党是支持目前内阁的进步纲领的。共产党支持内阁，使它能够执行它纲领中的进步因素。
    艾地说，如果政府具有代表人民利益的纲领，并且有各革命阶级参加，这个政府就可以称为民族联合政府。艾地着重指出，但是有若干共产党的代表参加政府并不能改变这种旧民主主义政府的性质。目前，印度尼西亚共产党只要求成立旧民主主义的联合政府，但是根据印度尼西亚共产党的总纲领，它的目标是在将来建立新民主主义的联合政府。
    如果由共产党来决定的话，过渡到人民民主——社会主义准备阶段——的最好的方法是通过和平的议会斗争。但是共产党必须对反动派的恶毒的阴谋提高警惕。艾地也着重指出，在政府的政治领导权还在资本家或甚至在地主和买办的手中的时候，谈过渡到人民民主或社会主义的可能性是不恰当的。
    艾地在报告中重申了共产党的发展进步力量、团结中间力量和孤立顽固力量的政策。
    艾地指出，印度尼西亚现在在国际政治上享有最有利的地位，这种地位使它可以对和平事业作出更多的贡献。他说，印度尼西亚共产党目前的任务是促进印度尼西亚采取更积极的反殖民主义政策以及争取和平的政策，以加强印度尼西亚在世界上、特别是在亚非国家中的地位。同时，共产党必须努力利用印度尼西亚的有利的国际地位来为印度尼西亚人民的利益服务，尤其是在根除荷兰大资本家在印度尼西亚的经济影响的斗争方面。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党将不倦地为统一战线而努力。他说，印度尼西亚共产党尊重苏加诺总统提出的关于宗教界人士、民族主义者和共产党人之间合作的口号。
