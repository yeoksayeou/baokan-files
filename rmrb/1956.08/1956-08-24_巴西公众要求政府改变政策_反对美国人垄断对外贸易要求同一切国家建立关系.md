Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, August 22nd – Brazilian newspapers report that the recently held Rio de Janeiro Metallurgical Workers Congress, the Brazilian National Student Congress, the Conference for the Defense of Brazilian Natural Resources, and other meetings, as well as some political figures, have demanded that the government change Brazil's foreign policy, oppose the American monopoly of Brazil's foreign trade, and demand the establishment of relations with all countries.

Labor Party Congressman José Alves said: "Brazil's foreign policy is not independent." Social Democratic Party Congressman Leopoldo Riel said: "In order to keep up with world developments, we must adopt a different stance on international issues."

"Workers' Voice" pointed out that Brazil needs funds to develop its economy and improve the living standards of its people. Despite this, the Brazilian government still allows American monopolies to extract large amounts of funds to the United States.

The newspaper said that Brazil's trade with the United States causes Brazil huge losses because the United States buys Brazilian products at low prices but sells goods to Brazil at very high prices.

"Workers' Voice" concluded that the first step for Brazil to move towards an independent foreign policy must be to establish friendly relations with all countries, first and foremost with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. The newspaper emphatically pointed out that by trading with the Soviet Union, Brazil can eliminate the situation where prices are unilaterally determined by the United States, and can also purchase the Soviet machinery and equipment necessary for the development of Brazil's national economy.

    巴西公众要求政府改变政策
    反对美国人垄断对外贸易要求同一切国家建立关系
    新华社据塔斯社蒙得维的亚22日讯　巴西报纸报道，最近举行的里约热内卢冶金工人代表大会、巴西学生全国代表大会、保卫巴西天然资源代表大会和其他会议以及一些政界人士，都要求政府改变巴西的外交政策，反对美国人垄断巴西的对外贸易，并且要求同一切国家建立关系。
    劳工党议员若泽·阿维斯说：“巴西的外交政策是不独立的。”社会民主党议员利奥柏图·李尔说：“为了跟得上世界事态的发展，我们必须在国际问题上采取另一种立场。”
    “工人呼声报”指出，巴西需要资金来发展经济，提高人民的生活水平。尽管如此，巴西政府还是许可美国的垄断组织把大量的资金抽到美国去。
    这家报纸说，巴西对美国的贸易使巴西蒙受巨大损失，因为美国以低价购买巴西的产品，却以很高的价格向巴西出售商品。
    “工人呼声报”最后说，巴西走向独立的外交政策的第一个步骤必须是同一切国家建立友好关系，首先是同苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家建立友好关系。报纸着重指出，同苏联贸易，巴西就可以消除由美国独断地决定价格的情况，同时也可以购买发展巴西国民经济所必需的苏联机器和装备。
