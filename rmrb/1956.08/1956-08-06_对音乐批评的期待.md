Title: Expectations for Music Criticism

For several years, our music criticism has been underdeveloped. Anyone who is interested, by simply flipping through music publications of the past few years, or checking newspapers and periodicals that have published music-related texts, will sense this. Although some people have often written theoretical articles with an instructive tone to guide the development of musical art, these articles, while based on sound principles, sometimes lacked balance. At one time, the atmosphere of music criticism seemed to be developing greatly, for example, talking a lot about a certain person, a certain work, a certain point of view, but some of them were making a fuss about trifles and exaggerating. However, for many creations and performances, few people are willing to take the time and effort to seriously analyze the structure, content, harmony, accompaniment... and even its style, and responsibly introduce it to the masses. Some people, either because of their favoritism, particularly appreciate a certain composer, even if the author himself is not willing to publish the work, they are happy to bring it up in public and give it a high evaluation; or they have already heard that a certain work of someone is not good, but because of the author's "prestige" and "status," they only express dissatisfaction in private and do not have the courage to offer public criticism. The most common phenomenon is to express indifference to most of the composers' works, as if "seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing." At the same time, there are also few people commenting on the performing arts of singers and instrumentalists (including singing groups and instrumental groups).

Now, the capital is holding our unprecedented first Music Week, and we sincerely expect music critics to completely change the past situation; starting from this Music Week, do more analytical research work, listen more to the opinions of the performers and the masses, and then come up with their own opinions and say fair words for the performed works. Truly good works, through the introduction of critics, will spread faster and further among the masses, because the masses will be more likely to accept them as a result. If the work is not good, no matter how sharp the critic's opinion is, as long as it is reasoned and convincing, it will be of great benefit to the criticized author. But don't forget the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom."

    对音乐批评的期待
    郑律成　放平
    几年来我们的音乐批评是不发达的。凡是有心人，只要翻翻这几年的音乐刊物，或者查查登载过有关音乐文字的报刊，就会感觉出这一点。虽然也曾有人为了指导音乐艺术的发展，常常写些带指示性的理论文章，这种文章立论严正，却有时失之偏颇。某一时候，音乐批评的空气似乎大有开展，比如对某一人，某一作品，某一观点，谈了不少，有的却又不免小题大做，言过其实。可是对于许多创作和演出，却没有多少人肯认真花点时间，用点心血，分析分析作品的结构，内容，和声，伴奏……以至它的风格，并且负责地向群众介绍。有的人，要么是由于偏爱，对某一作曲家特别赞赏，即或是作者自己还不愿意拿出来发表的作品，也乐于在公开的场合提出来给予很高的评价；要么又是已经听出来某某的某一作品不好，由于作者的“威望”和“地位”，却又只是私下表示不满，而没有勇气提出公开的批评。最普遍的现象是对作曲家们的大多数作品表示冷淡，好像“视而不见，听而不闻”似的。同时对于歌唱家和演奏家（包括歌唱团体和演奏团体）的表演艺术，也同样很少有人评论。
    现在，首都正举行我国空前的第一届音乐周，我们衷心地期待着音乐批评家们，彻底改变一下过去的情况；就从这次音乐周开始，多做些分析研究的工作，多听听演唱人员和群众的意见，然后拿出自己的见解，为演出的作品说一说公正的话。真正好的作品，通过批评家的介绍，它会在群众中流传得更快更远，因为群众会因此而更容易接受。如果作品不好，批评家的意见不管多尖锐，只要讲出了道理来，说得人家能够心服，对于被批评的作者来说，也会是大有教益的。但是千万不要忘记“百花齐放”这样一个方针。
