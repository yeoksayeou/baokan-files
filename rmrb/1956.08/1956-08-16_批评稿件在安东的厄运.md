    The Misfortune of Critical Manuscripts in Andong
    Ying Ying
    Recently, within the editorial department of the Andong Daily, a growing perception has been circulating: if a critical manuscript touches upon municipal leading cadres or leading organs, it is unlikely to escape the fate of being "sentenced" or "executed." Sometimes, certain groups, unable to accept this situation, boldly draft such critical manuscripts, only to nervously prepare a replacement article to be swapped out at night while submitting the original for publication.

    Why is this perception circulating? Why has this pattern formed? The answers can be found in the facts listed below.

    Such "Reasons"
    In June of last year, the editorial department received a letter criticizing Xu Jingyi, the manager of the Coal Construction Company, for fraudulently obtaining subsidies. After deliberation, it was felt that this was a problem existing in many units, so a reader's letter was compiled and placed on the newspaper's proof.

    That evening, the general editorial office received a phone call from Zhang Yunjie, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, instructing the newspaper not to publish it.

    "Secretary-General Zhang, this article has been verified multiple times, the facts are..." we pleaded.

    "No, because the mayor and the chairman of the trade union have engaged in this behavior, it cannot be published!"

    "But..." we wanted to discuss our reasons, but the other party hung up the phone with a "slam."

    The mayor and the chairman of the trade union have engaged in this behavior, is that a reason not to criticize the manager of the Coal Construction Company? We disagreed with this view and called Wei Zhi, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, for instructions. The Secretary was not at home, so we had to consult Han Bo, the Minister of Propaganda, whose response was as expected – "pull the article."

    Although the article was withdrawn (and efforts were made to have it published in August), we could not understand what the publication or non-publication of this letter had to do with "the mayor and the chairman of the trade union have engaged in this behavior." It was not until the Municipal Party Congress was held in June of this year that we learned a little about the situation: it turned out that Mayor Duan Yongjie and Deputy Mayor Jiang Jing had both fraudulently obtained subsidies, and Mayor Duan had even received a disciplinary warning within the Party for this.

    "Study and Discuss Further"
    In December of last year, a high tide of agricultural cooperativization had already swept through the suburbs of Andong City, with more than 90% of farmers participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The newspaper reported these developments with large headlines every day. However, according to a letter we received, the Andong Municipal Women's Federation issued a notice to the suburban areas at this time, instructing each village to plan the number of women participating in mutual aid groups for 1957. Therefore, we compiled a reader's letter and sent it to the proofs.

    Who knew that the instruction to withdraw the article would come again that night? Propaganda Minister Han Bo called and said it should not be published, the reason being simply to "study and discuss further!"

    After many days, the real reason for this withdrawal was revealed through "internal news." It turned out that this notice was issued under the instruction of Yu Fang, the Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Municipal Women's Federation. When she heard that the newspaper was going to criticize her, she cried and shouted, finding Propaganda Minister Han Bo and demanding that the newspaper not publish it, so as not to damage her prestige. Therefore, the general editorial office received that instruction to "study and discuss further."

    However, "studying and discussing" has continued until now, with no follow-up, and we have not heard them "say anything more."

    Strange Logic
    In April of this year, reporters visited the Liaoning Silk Spinning Factory and learned a lot about the factory leadership's lack of concern for the hardships of the workers. The main issues were: the workers lived in dilapidated, drafty houses and had repeatedly requested repairs, but the factory leaders ignored them; workers jointly wrote a letter to the Municipal Party Committee, which believed the factory's false report that "the problem had been completely resolved" and did not pursue the matter further. In reality, it had not been resolved at all. Some newly married couples (there were twenty-four couples at the time), because they had no housing, lived in collective dormitories and could not be together for long periods. The workers requested to build housing using a self-built and publicly assisted method, but the factory ignored them, while the factory had saved more than 58,000 yuan in enterprise bonus funds in the past two years. Another problem was discrimination against pregnant women, who were passed around and sometimes assigned to carry bricks. Last year alone, eighty-five pregnant women had miscarriages.

    After deliberation by the newspaper's editorial committee, it was decided that these situations should be written by the reporter in an article entitled "Husbands and Wives Live Across the Building But Cannot Meet." After the article was written, it was repeatedly verified with the workers, factory director, and Party secretary of the silk spinning factory, and it was sent to the newspaper's proofs on May 6.

    At more than 8:00 in the evening, Wei Zhi, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, called. The Secretary seemed not too calm and, without giving any reason, asked in the first sentence: "Why are you criticizing the silk spinning factory? Huh? What good is it to do this? Where do you want to lead the central work? You editorial committee should discuss it carefully!"

    The questions raised by the Secretary really confused us. Does this mean that in the high tide of industrial production, we cannot criticize the bureaucratic style of not caring about the hardships of the workers? Does leadership concern for the workers lead the industrial high tide to a low ebb?

    In order to sound a timely warning to the silk spinning factory and factories with similar situations, the editor-in-chief later requested instructions several times, pleading with reasons. Secretary Wei Zhi no longer said that it would "lead the central work to somewhere," but instead raised another reason: "This article says 'Husbands and Wives Live Across the Building But Cannot Meet,' which has a petty-bourgeois sentiment and cannot be published!" What a strange reason this is!

    Afraid of "Antagonism" and "Passivity"
    On April 1st of this year, the Andong Daily was preparing to publish an article entitled "Liu Jingshan's Despicable Behavior." Liu Jingshan was the Deputy Director of the Andong Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. Since 1953, he had abused his wife and children, engaged in promiscuous relationships, and consistently rejected Party education. In January of this year, because Liu Jingshan repeatedly refused to mend his ways, the Party ordered him to suspend his duties for introspection. Even during this period of introspection, he was still seen strolling on the street with his lover, continuing to engage in improper relations. This situation can be said to be very serious. After contacting the Municipal Supervisory Committee and other departments, it was decided to expose him in the newspaper.

    That evening, Li Tefu, a member of the Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Mayor, instructed a comrade from the Party General Branch of the Municipal People's Committee to tell the newspaper not to publish the article criticizing Liu Jingshan, giving two reasons: first, Liu Jingshan has not yet recognized his mistakes, and publishing it may cause Liu Jingshan to develop antagonistic emotions; second, the Municipal People's Committee branch is preparing to discuss his punishment recently, and publication may cause passivity in the branch's work.

    It is truly incomprehensible why a responsible comrade only considers the "antagonism" of the person who made mistakes and the "passivity" of the branch, without considering the educational effect of this criticism on the person who made mistakes and the broad masses of cadres. Why is there such consideration for the person who made mistakes, and such lack of support for the newspaper's criticism?

    Therefore, the editor-in-chief made a phone call to Wei Zhi, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. Before we could finish explaining our opinions, the Secretary raised a series of questions:

    "Huh? What harm is there in not publishing it? Huh? What harm is there? Huh?..."

    In fact, the Secretary did not want us to answer these questions, because he hung up the phone before we had time to answer.

    This article ended its life in this way.

    What conclusions will people draw after reading these facts? The leading comrades of the CPC Andong Municipal Committee seem to have forgotten that they have a responsibility to lead the newspaper in fully carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and "to ensure that the Party Committee's organ newspaper can regularly carry out correct and healthy criticism and self-criticism."

    批评稿件在安东的厄运
    英英
    最近，在安东日报编辑部里，越来越多地流传着这样一种看法：只要批评稿里多少涉及一点市领导干部或领导机关，这篇稿子就很难逃出“判刑”或“枪毙”的命运。有时候，有的组不能安于这种现状，大胆地编写出一点这样的批评稿件，也总是在发稿的同时，提心吊胆地准备出晚上抽换的预备稿。
    为什么会流传着这种看法？为什么会形成这个规律？从下边列举的几件事实中就可以找到答案。
    这样的“理由”
    去年六月份，编辑部接到一封批评煤建公司经理徐经一骗取补助费的来信，经过研究以后，觉得这是当前不少单位存在着的一个问题，所以就编了个读者来信发到报纸大样上了。
    当天晚上，总编室就接到了市委秘书长张云杰的电话，指示报社不准发表。
    “张秘书长，这篇稿子对证好多遍了，事实……”我们申诉了意见。
    “不，因为市长和工会主席都有这种行为，不能发表！”
    “但是……”我们还想谈谈理由，对方却把电话“啪”的一声挂上了。
    市长和工会主席都有这种行为，难道就是不准批评煤建公司经理的理由吗？我们不同意这个看法，便打电话请示市委书记卫之，书记不在家，只好请示宣传部长韩波，结果和预料的一样——“抽稿”。
    稿虽然抽下来了（到八月份又争取发表了），但是，发表或不发表这封来信同“市长和工会主席都有这种行为”究竟有什么关系，我们却一时不能理解。直到今年六月份开市党代表大会时才知道一点情况：原来市长段永杰、副市长江静都骗取过补助费，段市长为此还受到党内劝告处分。
    “研究研究再说”
    去年十二月份，安东市郊区已经掀起了农业合作化高潮，90％以上的农户都参加了高级农业生产合作社，报纸每天都以大字标题报道这些消息。但是，从我们接到的一封来信看，安东市妇女联合会却在这个时候给郊区下了一份通知，叫各村规划1957年妇女参加互助组的数字。于是，我们编了个读者来信，发到大样上。
    谁知道，当天晚上抽稿的指示又来了。宣传部长韩波来电话不让发表，原因嘛，只是“研究研究再说”！
    过了不少日子，这次抽稿的真实原因才从“内部消息”透露出来。原来，这个通知是市妇联农村工作部副部长于方指示发的，当她听说报纸要批评的时候，便大哭大喊的找到宣传部长韩波，要求不准报纸发表，免得有损威信。所以，总编室才接到那次“研究研究再说”的抽稿指示。
    可是，“研究研究”到现在，并无下文，也没有听到他们“再说”什么。
    古怪的逻辑
    今年四月份，记者到辽宁绢纺工厂了解了不少工厂领导方面不关心职工疾苦的事。其中主要是：工人们住着透风的小破房，几次要求修补，工厂领导却置之不理；工人联名写信给市委，市委听信了工厂的假汇报：“问题完全解决了”，就再也不管了。其实，根本没有解决。有些新婚的夫妇（当时有二十四对），因为没有房子，都住在集体宿舍里，常年不得相聚，工人要求自建公助的办法来建筑住宅，工厂也不管，而工厂去年和前年却结余了五万八千多元的企业奖励基金。另一个问题就是孕妇受到歧视，推来推去，有的最后被分配去拉砖头。去年一年就有八十五名孕妇流产。
    经过报社编辑委员会研究决定，这些情况由记者写成了一篇题为“夫妻对楼不相逢”的文章。文章写好后，经过和绢纺工厂工人、厂长、党委书记再三对证，在五月六日发到了报纸大样上。
    晚上八点多钟，市委书记卫之来电话了。书记好像不太冷静，没讲什么理由，头一句就问：“你们为什么批评绢纺工厂。啊？这样搞有什么好处？你们想把中心工作引向哪里去？你们编委会好好讨论讨论！”
    书记提的问题真把我们弄糊涂了，难道说在工业生产高潮中就不能批评那种不关心职工疾苦的官僚主义作风？难道领导上关心了职工以后就会把工业高潮引向低潮？
    为了对绢纺工厂和有类似情况的工厂适时地敲敲警钟，以后，总编辑又请示了几次，申诉了理由，卫之书记又不说把“中心工作引向哪里”了，另外提出一条理由：“这篇稿件说什么‘夫妻对楼不相逢’，有小资产阶级情调，不能发表！”这是多么奇怪的理由啊！
    害怕“对抗”和“被动”
    今年四月一日，安东日报准备发表“刘景善的卑鄙行为”一稿。刘景善是安东市民政局的副局长，他从1953年起，就虐待自己的妻子儿女，乱搞男女关系，一贯拒绝党的教育。今年一月份，刘景善因屡教不改，党叫他停职反省，就在反省期间，他还和情人一起逛马路，继续发生不正当的关系。这个情况可以说是很严重的了，经过和市监委等部门的联系，决定在报纸上揭发。
    当天晚上，市委委员、副市长李特夫指示市人民委员会党总支的一位同志告诉报社，批评刘景善的稿件不要发表，理由有二：第一刘景善现在还没有认识错误，发表出来，恐怕刘景善产生对抗情绪。第二，市人民委员会支部最近准备讨论对他的处分，发表以后，可能给支部工作造成被动。
    真使人不能明白，一个负责同志为什么只想到犯错误的人的“对抗”和支部的“被动”，而不考虑这一批评对犯错误的本人和广大干部的教育作用。为什么对犯错误的人这样体贴，而对报纸的批评这样不支持？
    于是，总编辑给市委书记卫之打了一个电话，还没等我们把意见讲完，书记就提出了一连串的问题：
    “啊？不发表有什么坏处？啊？有什么坏处？啊？……”
    其实，书记并不想叫我们解答这些问题，因为他没等我们来得及回答，就把电话挂上了。
    这篇稿子就这样的结束了它的生命。
    看了上面这样一些事实，人们会得出什么样的结论呢？中共安东市委的领导同志们似乎忘了自己有责任领导报纸充分地开展批评和自我批评，“要保证党委的机关报能够经常地开展正确的、健全的批评和自我批评。”
