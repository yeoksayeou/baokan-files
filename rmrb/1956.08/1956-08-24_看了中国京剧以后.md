    After Seeing Chinese Peking Opera
    Japan　Ueda Sadako
    Editor's Note: During the visit and performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan, they received many enthusiastic letters from Japanese audiences. These letters expressed the great interest of the Japanese people in Chinese Peking Opera art and their deep feelings for the Chinese people. Published here is a letter from a Japanese middle school teacher, Ueda Sadako, to the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation.

    Dear gentlemen of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation:
    I first saw your enthusiastic performance on the evening of May 30th. Since that day, I have seen ten of your performances in total. Mr. Kawatake Shigetoshi, director of the Waseda University Theatre Museum, said, "After seeing Peking Opera, you'll be enchanted for three days." Well, I'll be enchanted for at least a month. To thank you, gentlemen, I'm picking up my pen to write you a few words.
    I studied English and French, and now I work as an English teacher and am engaged in French literature research. I am very concerned about China. I have read Jack Belden's "China Shakes the World" and have great expectations for the development of New China. I want to see Beijing, which people call "the most beautiful capital in the world." Last year I saw the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, and this time, after seeing Peking Opera, my eyes have been opened.
    Since seeing Peking Opera on the evening of May 30th, I have become more convinced of history and more firmly believe in the future of mankind. Needless to say, every play moved me and will be unforgettable for the rest of my life.
    Before you came to Japan, I had high expectations for you. But your excellent performance exceeded my original expectations. I don't know how to express my feelings. I got up at four o'clock in the morning to catch the first train (this is the first time in my life I've taken the first train) to buy tickets. To see Peking Opera, I didn't go to work for four days. The summer allowance, which I obtained with difficulty, was used up in large part to see the plays.
    Many Japanese audiences watch the plays with different perspectives. Because I am very interested in New China, I wanted to take advantage of your performance in Japan to understand one aspect of New China's cultural policy. This wish has been fully realized. From the dazzling stage, the many fascinating performances, and the bright and gorgeous costumes, I saw the faces of the people who have grown up in New China.
    On the evening of May 30th, I listened carefully to Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's opening remarks and couldn't help but shed tears. Looking back, for a long time, China and Japan were in a state of war. Some people in our country committed serious war crimes in your country, and even now, diplomatic relations have not been formally restored. It is such a pity that there has been no cultural exchange between China and Japan for nearly twenty years. After Japan's defeat, with the liberation of China, a broad road to a new world was also opened in our country. However, because the leading figures in Japan hesitate to face this direction, Japan and your country are still in such an abnormal and unreasonable state. Last year, during China's National Day, the Japanese Sarunosuke Theatre Company, which was invited to China, was treated as state guests; but this time you came to Japan, the Japanese government did not offer you any hospitality. As an ordinary citizen, I am deeply dissatisfied and consider it very impolite. I would like to express my apologies to you from the bottom of my heart. Although diplomatic relations have not been established, our people are able to welcome you and see the performances of Mr. Mei Lanfang and many famous actors. I deeply feel that many people have made great efforts to create these conditions. In particular, the Chinese government's hospitality and goodwill have deeply touched me.
    I heard that this visit to Japan by the Peking Opera Delegation is even larger than the one to Europe, and even Mr. Mei Lanfang participated. I am truly grateful for China's extraordinary friendliness towards Japan. At the end of the closing performance, the audience on and off the stage shouted "Long live!" together, and the actors in their costumes also shouted "Long live!" in Japanese. This scene moved me very much again. If allowed, I would have liked to go on stage and shake hands with each of you. In any case, I hope that when you return, you will convey our heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people who have given us invaluable friendship. My response to this friendship is also friendship, and I will do my best to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. I am determined to learn Chinese and join the "Japan-China Friendship Association."
    I have another feeling, which may be a bit ridiculous; I often feel that among Japanese intellectuals, there is a tendency to lean towards Europe and the United States, and I myself am blindly pursuing European things, which is shameful. We should learn from Eastern things, learn from Chinese things. If Peking Opera hadn't moved me, I might not have realized this. After the war, many young people in Japan lost their future and hope. Today, I understand what I should do in the future.
    Since meeting you, a new kind of joy has been added to my life's pleasures. That is the hope that one day I can go to Beijing to see Peking Opera. For this, we must also strive for the freedom of air traffic between Japan and China.
    The infectiousness of Peking Opera is really too deep for me. When I think of the stage image of Peking Opera, and the image of women full of strength within gentleness, I feel happy. Because what I cannot feel in Japanese classical arts such as Kabuki, Noh, Kyogen, and Bunraku (puppet show), I have received from you. From young people to old people, from children to adults, everyone praises Peking Opera. This is truly great. It is a pity that, due to various reasons, only a portion of people have the opportunity to appreciate it. I believe that in the near future, more people will have the opportunity to appreciate it, and I will work hard for this.
    It is a pity that just when we are familiar with the actors appearing on stage, in addition to Mr. Mei Lanfang, and can shout out "Ah! That's Li Shaochun, that's Yuan Shihai," we have to part with you. I hope you will definitely, definitely come to Japan again. Everyone is waiting for that day to come.
    I wish you good health, and I hope to see you again in the near future!

### 看了中国京剧以后

    看了中国京剧以后
    日本　上田贞子
    编者按：我国访日京剧代表团在日本访问演出期间，接到许多日本观众热情的来信。这些信件表达了日本人民对我国京剧艺术具有极大的兴趣，对我国人民具有深厚的感情。这里发表的是日本一位中学教师——上田贞子给访日京剧代表团的信。中国访日京剧代表团的诸位先生：
    我第一次看到你们的热心表演，是在五月三十日的晚上。从那一天起，我一共看了你们十场演出。早稻田大学演剧博物馆馆长河竹繁俊先生说：“看过京剧想三天”，那末我至少要陶醉一个月了。为了感谢各位先生，我拿起笔来给你们写几句话。
    我是学英文和法文的，现在作一个英文教师，并从事法国文学的研究工作。我很关心中国，读过杰克·别尔登的“中国撼动世界”一书，对新中国的发展寄予很大的期待。我想一定要到人们称为“世界最美丽的首都”北京去看看。去年看了中国商品展览会，这次看了京剧，已打开了我的眼界。
    从五月三十日的晚上看了京剧以来，我更加相信历史，更加坚定地相信人类的未来。不用说，每一出戏都使我感动，使我毕生难忘。
    在你们来日本之前，我就对你们寄予了很大的期待。但你们的优秀的表演，超出了我原来的期待。我不知道怎样来表达我的心情。我早晨四点钟就起来赶乘第一班电车（这是我有生以来第一次乘第一班电车）去买戏票。为了看京戏，我四天没上班。经过斗争好容易得到的夏季津贴，为了看戏就用去了一大半。
    很多日本观众是抱着各不相同的观点去看戏的。我因为对新中国很感兴趣，很想通过你们的来日公演机会，知道新中国文化政策的一个方面。这个愿望完全实现了。从绚丽耀眼的舞台、很多引人入迷的表演、鲜艳华丽的服装中，我看到了在新中国成长起来的人们的面貌。
    在五月三十日的晚上，我细心地听着欧阳予倩先生在开幕式上的致辞，情不自禁地流下了眼泪。回想一下，很长期间日中两国处于战争状态，我国的一些人在贵国犯下了严重的战争罪行，而且直到现在还没正式恢复邦交。将近二十年期间中日之间没有什么文化交流，这是多么遗憾的事情。日本战败后，随着中国的解放，在我国也打开了走向新世界的康庄大道。但是，由于日本的首脑人物们面对这个方向踌躇不前，至今日本和贵国之间仍处在这样不正常不合理的状态中。在去年中国国庆节，被邀请去中国的日本猿之助剧团，受到国宾的待遇；可是你们此次到日本，日本政府对你们没有任何招待；作为一个老百姓，我深感不满，并认为很不礼貌，我从心里向你们表示歉意。虽然国交未建立，而我国人民却能够欢迎你们，看到梅兰芳先生和许多著名演员的表演，我深切地感到创造出这种条件的很多人作了很大的努力。特别是中国政府方面的盛情和好意，深深地打动了我。
    这次的访日京剧代表团听说比去欧洲的规模还大，连梅兰芳先生也参加了。我实在感谢中国这种对日本的绝非寻常的友好。闭幕演出结束的时候，台上台下一起三呼万岁，穿戏装的演员们也用日语喊着“万岁”，这种情景又使我很感动。如果允许的话，我想到台上和你们一一握手。不管怎样，希望你们回去的时候，把我们衷心的谢意转致给予我们无比珍贵友谊的中国人民。我对这个友谊的回答也是友谊，我将竭尽全力来争取恢复中日邦交。我决心学习中国语和加入“日中友好协会”。
    我还有另一种感觉，也许有些可笑；我常常感到在日本的知识分子当中，有向欧美一边倒的倾向，我自己也在一味追求欧洲的东西，这是可耻的。我们应该学习东方的东西，学习中国的东西。要不是京剧感动了我，也许我还意识不到这一点。战后，日本的许多青年失掉了前途和希望。今天，我懂得了今后应当作什么。
    自从见到你们，我生活乐趣中又增添了一种快乐。那就是希望有那末一天我能到北京去看京剧。为此也就必须争取日本同中国通航的自由。
    京剧对我的感染力实在太深了，我一想起京剧的舞台形象，想起在温柔之中充满力量的女性的形像，就觉快乐。因为在日本的古典艺术歌舞伎、能、狂言、文乐（木偶戏）之中感受不到的东西，从你们那里得到了。从年轻人到年老人，从小孩子到大人，人人都赞美京剧，这实在是伟大的。遗憾的是，由于种种的原因，仅有一部分人得到欣赏的机会。我相信不久的将来，会有更多的人得到欣赏的机会，我也要为此而努力。
    很可惜，当我们刚刚熟悉舞台上出现的演员，除梅兰芳先生之外，并能喊出“啊！那是李少春，那是袁世海”的时候，就要与你们分别了。希望你们一定、一定再来日本。大家都在等待着那一天的到来。
    祝你们健康，并希望在最近期间与你们再会！
