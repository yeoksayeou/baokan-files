Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 14th. The water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area reached 120 meters at 2:00 PM today, and the water level is still rising.

This morning, a series of booming explosions echoed from the earth mounds in the urban area. These are the sounds of the People's Liberation Army engineering company using efficient blasting techniques to extract soil. At the soil extraction sites at the San Kong Bridge and the power plant, bulldozers and cranes from the capital construction departments were also dispatched to support the soil extraction and loading work. After the intense labor of several hundred railway employees last night, the three temporary railway lines built on the urban roads were completed tonight, and entire trains of soil can be unloaded directly onto the embankment before midnight tonight. More than 20,000 construction workers have also been mobilized, and they have pledged to build two sections of the second line of flood control dikes, each six kilometers long, within three days.

Yesterday afternoon, Harbin City experienced a sudden rain shower, and the roads along the embankment became muddy. However, the soldiers and civilians participating in the dike construction continued to work diligently in the rain, and the foundations of many critical dikes were widened by several meters overnight.

    哈尔滨水势继续上涨
    新华社哈尔滨14日电　哈尔滨地区松花江水位今天下午二时已高达一百二十公尺，水势尚在上涨中。
    今天早晨，在市区的土岗上，发出了隆隆的爆破声，这是人民解放军工兵连正在运用高效率的爆破取土法。在三孔桥和发电厂取土工地上，基本建设部门的推土机和吊车也派来支援取土和装车工作。经过几百个铁路员工在昨夜的紧张劳动，建筑在市区道路上的三条临时性铁道在今天晚上完工，整列车的泥土在今天子夜前可以直接卸到堤岸。二万多个建筑工人也已经动员起来，他们提出保证在三天建好六公里长的两段第二道防汛堤坝。
    昨天下午，哈尔滨市曾经降了一阵骤雨，沿堤道路泥泞，但是参加修堤的军民都冒雨紧张劳动，许多险要的堤坝基础都在一夜之间加宽了好几公尺。
