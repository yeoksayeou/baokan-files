Xinhua News Agency, August 8th - According to Kyodo News, Okinawa representatives Kaneji Saichi and Senaga Kamejiro on the 6th accused the Japanese government and various political parties of the US military's recent atrocities of using gasoline to burn farmland in order to forcibly seize land, requesting their support for the Okinawan people's struggle against the US's forced land seizure.

The two representatives, who came to Japan to attend the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that all 300,000 tsubo (one tsubo is approximately 3.3 square meters) of arable land in the village of Maza in Ie Island, Okinawa, was forcibly requisitioned by the US military in April last year. At that time, the US military did not pay adequate compensation, and in order to maintain their livelihoods, the farmers had no choice but to continue cultivating the requisitioned land. However, in July this year, the US military actually used airplanes to spray gasoline on the residents' farmland, burning the entire crop that was about to be harvested, and forcibly requisitioned 300,000 tsubo of farmland in the village.

This atrocity of the US military in Okinawa has aroused widespread attention in Japan. Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Eiichi Tanaka also believes that "this is a serious matter" and must be "handled properly." The Japanese Socialist Party is requesting the House of Representatives to hold meetings of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee to hear the Okinawan representatives explain the situation in Okinawa. Inajiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, also told the Okinawan representatives that the Socialist Party will request the Japanese government to investigate the actual situation in Okinawa.

    冲绳代表愤怒控诉
    美军焚烧庄稼强征土地
    新华社8日讯　据共同社报道，冲绳岛代表兼次佐一和濑长龟次郎六日向日本政府和各政党控诉美军最近用汽油焚烧庄稼地来强征土地的暴行，要求它们支持冲绳岛人民反对美国强征土地的斗争。
    这两位到日本出席第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的代表说，冲绳的伊江岛真谢村的所有耕地三十万坪（一坪约合三点三平方公尺）曾经在去年四月被美军强制征用。当时美军并没有付给足额的赔偿，农民为了维持生活，不得不在被征用的土地上继续耕种。但是，今年七月间，美军竟然用飞机向居民的庄稼地喷洒汽油，烧光了正在收获期的整片庄稼，并且强制征用了这个村的三十万坪耕地。
    美军在冲绳岛的这种暴行在日本引起了广泛的重视。日本内阁官房副长官田中荣一也认为“这是严重的事情”，要“好好处理”。日本社会党正在要求众议院举行外务委员会和法务委员会会议听取冲绳代表说明冲绳岛的情况。社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎还向冲绳代表说，社会党将要求日本政府调查冲绳岛的实况。
