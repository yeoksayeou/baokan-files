Xinhua News Agency, Hami, August 13th. Since Hami melons came on the market in late July, over ten thousand Hami melons and watermelons have been shipped from Hami to the various ethnic groups of workers constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway along the hundreds of kilometers of the Gobi Desert along the Yumen, Hongliuyuan, and Xingxingxia lines. The 200,000 jin of Hami melons supplied to the Yumen Oil Mine will also be shipped successively after late August. This year, a total of 2 million jin of Hami melons will be shipped to these construction sites, mining areas, and various provinces in the interior, which is ten times that of last year.

In order to support the construction of the motherland, the farmers of Hami County have vigorously expanded the production of the special product Hami melon this year. The melon field area has expanded by nearly one time compared with last year, and it is estimated that at least 2-3 million jin of Hami melons can be produced.

    哈密瓜大批外运
    新华社哈密13日电　从七月下旬哈密瓜上市以来，已经从哈密给正在玉门、红柳园、星星峡一线几百公里戈壁上修建兰新铁路的各族工人运去了上万个哈密瓜和西瓜。供应玉门油矿的二十万斤哈密瓜也将在八月下旬以后陆续起运。今年运往这些建设工地，矿区和内地各省的哈密瓜共将有二百万斤，等于去年的十倍。
    哈密县农民为了支援祖国各地建设，今年大力扩大了特产哈密瓜的生产，瓜田面积比去年扩大将近一倍，估计最少可产哈密瓜二三百万斤。
