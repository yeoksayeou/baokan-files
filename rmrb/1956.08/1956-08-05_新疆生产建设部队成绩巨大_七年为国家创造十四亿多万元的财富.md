Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd: The amount of water conservancy projects and land reclamation to be completed by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps this year is equal to the total amount of the previous six years. In the past seven years, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has created wealth worth more than 1,427 million yuan for the country and trained a large number of technical personnel for production and construction. This was stated by Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Commander of the Production and Construction Corps, to Xinhua reporters on the eve of "August 1st" Army Day.

　　In Xinjiang, where there is little rainfall throughout the year, farmland depends entirely on water conservancy irrigation. In the past seven years, the officers and soldiers of the corps have built eight reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 276 million cubic meters. A total of 154 large canals and more than 4,000 small canals have been built, with a total length of more than 16,500 kilometers. A total of 4.14 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed on the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, of which 580,000 mu has been distributed to farmers of all ethnic groups.

　　The sown area of ​​the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in 1950 was more than 835,000 mu, which increased to 1.73 million mu this year. From 1950 to 1955, the total harvest in six years was equivalent to 1,039.62 million jin of wheat. By the end of this year, there will be 772,000 head of livestock of all kinds. At the same time, 97 factories and mines of various sizes have been established in the past seven years; the transportation volume completed by automobiles is 1,296.82 million ton-kilometers. Since 1951, 690,000 square meters of construction area has been completed in the past six years.

　　In the past seven years, the Production and Construction Corps has trained a large number of technical personnel from actual production, and the vast majority of production personnel have also basically mastered crop cultivation techniques. Therefore, large-scale bumper harvests of cotton, wheat, corn and other crops have been achieved year after year, and thousands of advanced producers have emerged. Among them, cotton planting expert Liu Xuefo has twice set national records. It is estimated that this year there will be more than 10,000 mu of cotton with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, more than 40,000 mu of corn with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and 65,000 mu of wheat with a yield of 400 jin per mu.

　　The Production and Construction Corps has implemented the instructions of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee, and has vigorously helped farmers of all ethnic groups develop production and agricultural cooperation movement in recent years. Last year and this year, hundreds of cadres were dispatched to participate in the work of running agricultural cooperatives and technology promotion stations, and they also directly helped hundreds of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams technically. In March of this year, the Production and Construction Corps received more than 2,000 farmer representatives in the Manas Reclamation Area and Aksu Reclamation Area farms, who practiced the cultivation techniques of various crops in the field. More farmer representatives are planned to be received for practice in the future.

　　With the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogai Railway, the Production and Construction Corps will vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry, re-plan, design and build new farms, advance towards regular state-owned farms, and vigorously support the large-scale industrial construction of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region after the railway is opened to traffic.

    新疆生产建设部队成绩巨大
    七年为国家创造十四亿多万元的财富
    据新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆军区生产建设部队今年要完成的水利工程和开荒造田的工程量和投资额，都等于以前六年来的总和。七年来，新疆生产建设部队已经为国家创造了十四亿二千七百多万元的财富，培养了大批生产建设技术人材。这是中国人民解放军新疆军区副司令员、生产建设部队司令员陶峙岳上将在“八一”前夕对新华社记者说的。
    在终年少雨的新疆，农田全凭水利灌溉。七年来部队官兵们共修水库八处，总蓄水量为两亿七千六百万立方公尺。共修大渠道154条，小渠道四千多条，总长一万六千五百多公里。共在天山南北的荒原上开荒造田414万亩，其中分配给各族农民五十八万亩。
    新疆生产建设部队1950年播种面积为八十三万五千多亩，今年提高到173万亩。从1950年到1955年，六年来总收获量折合小麦为103，962万斤。到今年年底，各种牲畜将有七十七万二千头。同时，七年来建立了大小厂矿九十七个；汽车完成的运输量是129，682万吨公里。从1951年起，六年来完成六十九万平方公尺建筑面积。
    生产建设部队七年来从实际生产中，培养了大批技术人材，广大生产人员也基本上掌握作物栽培技术，所以连年取得了棉花、小麦、玉米和其他作物的大面积丰收，涌现了上千的先进生产者，其中植棉能手刘学佛曾两次创造全国纪录。今年预计可以出现每亩千斤的棉花一万多亩，每亩千斤的玉米四万多亩，每亩四百斤的小麦六万五千多亩。
    生产建设部队贯彻中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会和新疆军区党委指示，几年来大力帮助各族农民发展生产和农业合作化运动。去年和今年曾调派数百名干部参加办农业社和技术推广站的工作，又从技术上直接帮助了成百个的农业社和互助组。今年三月间，生产建设部队在玛纳斯垦区和阿克苏垦区农场接纳了两千多名农民代表，在场内实习各种作物的栽培技术。今后还准备接纳更多的农民代表来实习。
    随着兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路的建设，生产建设部队将大力发展农牧业，重新规划、设计和新建农场，向正规化的国营农场前进，并且大力支援铁路通车后新疆维吾尔自治区大规模的工业建设。
