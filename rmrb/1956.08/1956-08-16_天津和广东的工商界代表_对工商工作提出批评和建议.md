Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th—A symposium convened by the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce for private shareholder representatives of joint public-private enterprises concluded on the 12th after five days. More than 200 representatives from over 80 industries attended the symposium.

During their speeches, the representatives stated that since the implementation of the full industry-wide joint venture, both enterprise transformation and the ideological remolding of private personnel have achieved certain results, and the cooperative relationship between the public and private sides is basically normal. However, some public representatives do not have sufficient understanding of the changes in private personnel after the full industry-wide joint venture, and some enterprises lack sound working systems, so the authority of private personnel in the enterprises has not received due attention. In some specialized companies, public managers give work assignments directly to departments without consulting private managers, making it difficult for private personnel to work. Some private personnel often do not see the documents they should see and rarely participate in meetings to discuss production and management issues. The representatives also raised some opinions on personnel arrangements and welfare benefits for private personnel.

At the symposium, some representatives examined their shortcomings of being timid and afraid to take responsibility in their work and made suggestions on how to improve the public-private cooperative relationship. They requested that the Party committees and higher-level leading departments strengthen policy and ideological education for both the public and private sides and the workers, and quickly establish document circulation and meeting systems. They also hoped that public representatives would trust and respect the authority of private personnel and help them learn the management methods of socialist enterprises.

According to Xinhua News Agency, more than 150 representatives from industrial and commercial circles in Guangdong Province, at a symposium invited by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, raised criticisms and many beneficial suggestions on certain shortcomings in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and other work throughout the province. The symposium lasted four days from the 9th to the 12th.

Many of them talked about the personnel arrangements and the rational use of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises. Many representatives pointed out that the work arrangements for wholesalers who switched jobs before the high tide of socialist transformation were not appropriate enough, and many of these people were rich in business experience. For example, a wholesaler in Foshan who specializes in pigment color matching was arranged to be an usher in a theater, while now some pigment shops have no one to match colors. They believe that wholesalers like these should be rearranged to give full play to their strengths.

The representatives also pointed out that, nationally speaking, Guangdong Province was the first to hold a meeting of small vendors' representatives and formulate methods for arranging small vendors, but many of the measures decided at the meeting have not been implemented in some areas, such as the unreasonable adjustment of the wholesale-retail price difference, the still-too-low commission for agency sales of some commodities, and the still-too-tight bank loans. They hope that relevant departments will quickly solve these problems.

The representatives also put forward many opinions on Guangdong's foreign trade work, such as some representatives suggesting that attention should be paid to the packaging of export industrial products and to advertising to facilitate the export of industrial products. After all the shipping companies in Guangzhou were jointly operated, the ships traveling to Hong Kong and Macau sailed more slowly than in the past, delaying the time for many fresh and live goods to be launched in Hong Kong and Macau.

Wen Minsheng, Deputy Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the heads of Guangdong's industrial, commercial, and foreign trade departments attended the symposium. They also spoke on the last day of the meeting, warmly welcoming the criticisms and suggestions from people in the industrial and commercial circles, putting forward suggestions for improving the work, and answering some important questions.

### 天津和广东的工商界代表  对工商工作提出批评和建议

    天津和广东的工商界代表
    对工商工作提出批评和建议
    新华社天津14日电　天津市工商业联合会召集的公私合营企业私股代表座谈会，在举行五天后于十二日结束。有八十多个行业的二百多名代表出席了这次座谈会。
    代表们在发言中认为全行业合营以来，企业改造和私方人员的思想改造都有一定的成绩，公私双方的共事关系基本上是正常的。但是由于有些公股代表对全行业合营后私方人员的变化认识不足，加以有些企业中的工作制度不够健全，私方人员在企业中的职权没有受到应有的重视。有些专业公司的公方经理不同私方经理商量，直接向科室布置工作，使得私方人员工作不好搞。有些私方人员经常看不到应看的文件，很少参加讨论生产经营问题的会议。代表们还对人事安排和私方人员的福利待遇提出了一些意见。
    在座谈会上，有些代表检查了自己在工作上缩手缩脚、不敢大胆负责的缺点，对如何搞好公私共事关系提出了建议。他们要求中共党委和上级领导部门加强对公私双方和工人群众进行政策思想教育，迅速建立文件传阅、会议等制度。他们还希望公股代表要信任、尊重私方人员的职权，帮助他们学会社会主义企业的管理方法。
    据新华社讯　广东省各地工商界代表一百五十多人，在中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会邀请他们举行的座谈会上，对全省的私营工商业社会主义改造工作和其他工作的某些缺点，提出了批评和许多有益的建议。这次座谈会在九日到十二日共举行了四天。
    他们许多人都谈到公私合营企业中的人事安排问题和合理使用私方人员问题。不少代表提出在社会主义改造高潮以前转业的批发商的工作安排得不够适当，而这些人很多都富有经营经验。如佛山市一个专长颜料配色的批发商被安排到戏院带位，而现在一些颜料店又无人配色。他们认为像这类批发商应该重新安排，以发挥他们的长处。
    代表们还提出，在全国说来，广东省首先举行小商贩代表会议，订出办法安排小商贩，但是会议决定的好些措施在一些地区还没有得到贯彻，如批零差价没有合理调整，一些商品的代销手续费还是太低，银行贷款还是抓得过紧等等，他们希望有关部门迅速解决这些问题。
    对于广东省的对外贸易工作，代表们也提出不少意见，如有的代表提出应该重视出口工业品的包装，重视广告宣传，以利于工业品的外销。广州的船务行全部合营以后，往港澳的船只航行比过去缓慢，推迟了不少鲜活商品在港澳的上市时间。
    中共广东省委副书记文敏生和广东省工业、商业和对外贸易等部门的负责人都参加了这次座谈会。并在会议的最后一天作了发言，热烈欢迎工商界人士的批评和建议，提出了改进工作的意见，并回答了一些重要的问题。
