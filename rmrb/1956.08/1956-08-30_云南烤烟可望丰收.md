    Yunnan Baked Tobacco Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest
    (Our dispatch from Kunming) Yunnan Province's baked tobacco is expected to have a bumper harvest this year. Currently, the baked tobacco harvesting season has arrived, and the more than 180,000 mu of baked tobacco planted in 92 counties across the province has already begun to be harvested and baked. This year, the province's baked tobacco planting area has increased by more than two times compared to last year. Although some areas suffered temporary drought and insect pests after planting baked tobacco, the agricultural cooperatives actively rescued the crops and strengthened field management, and the baked tobacco still grew well. In Yuxi County, more than 30,000 mu of baked tobacco generally grew to be more than one person tall. The more than 60 mu of baked tobacco planted in Songguan Township looked like a dense forest at first glance, with the tallest growing to be twelve chi tall. The average yield per mu could reach more than 200 jin; the highest yield could reach 1,200 jin. In Jiangchuan County, one township's average yield per mu reached 600 jin. Gucheng Township in Tonghai County adopted the technique of retaining tobacco branches, which increased the production of rough tobacco by 15,000 jin. Because agricultural cooperatives learned baking techniques from each other, the quality of baked tobacco this year is higher than last year. The average quality of the bottom leaf tobacco in Zhenhai Township's agricultural cooperative reached grade six or higher. This year, the average yield of baked tobacco in the province can reach more than 150 jin per mu.

    云南烤烟可望丰收
    本报昆明电　云南省今年烤烟可望丰收。目前，烤烟收获季节已到，全省九十二个县种植的十八万多亩烤烟已经开始收割烘烤。今年全省烤烟种植面积比去年增大两倍以上，部分地区在种植烤烟以后，虽遭到了一时的干旱和虫灾，但经过农业社积极抢救和加强田间管理，烤烟仍然生长良好。玉溪县三万多亩烤烟，普遍长得一人多高，宋官乡种植的六十多亩烤烟，乍一看好像一片茂密的树林，最高的长到一丈二尺高，每亩平均能收二百斤以上；最高的产量能收到一千二百斤。江川县有一个乡每亩平均产量达到六百斤。通海县古城乡采取留烟杈的技术，使烤烟增产一万五千斤草烟。各农业社由于互相学习了烘烤技术，今年烤烟质量比去年提高，镇海乡农业社的脚叶烟平均烤到六级以上。今年的烤烟全省每亩平均产量可以达到一百五十斤以上。
