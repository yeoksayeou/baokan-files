    Prizes
    Receiving a prize should be both glorious and pleasant, but that is not always the case. For example, a young woman receiving a large undershirt of 100 centimeters; a Party Branch Committee member receiving a copy of "How to Strive to Join the Youth League"; and an old engineer with many children and grandchildren receiving the same booklet as young men, "How to Deal with Love Problems." It is truly laughable.

    奖品
    得到奖品，本应既光荣又愉快，但是也不尽然。例如年青姑娘领到一件一百公分的大背心；党总支委员领到一本“怎样争取入团”；子孙满堂的老工程师也照样跟小伙子一样得到了一本“如何对待恋爱问题”的小册子。真令人啼笑皆非。
