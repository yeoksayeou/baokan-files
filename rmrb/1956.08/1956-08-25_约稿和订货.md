　　Commissioning Articles and Ordering Goods
　　Kang Beihai
　　I don't know who started it, but commissioning articles is now called "ordering goods." Perhaps because the term is new, or because it fits the reality, the "ordering goods" term has caught on. An order contract must not only specify the delivery date, but more importantly, the quality of the goods, such as the weight, length, and so on. Commissioning articles, ordering the "goods" of writing, is ultimately different from ordering shoes or waterwheels. However, some editors commission articles in the same way that economic workers order goods. They set the topic for the author and even tell them what it means; although it's said to be for the author's reference, it can also be seen as the editorial department's requirement. I only recently learned that this is still a polite method of "ordering goods."
　　I often write some popular articles for "small newspapers" and "small publications." The few unpleasant "ordering goods" experiences I've encountered still belong to the polite category mentioned above. Recently, a "large publication" "ordered goods" from me. Needless to say, the topic was determined long ago, and even the content was decided. What to write at the beginning, what to write in the middle... and it's not "for reference"; there's almost no room for negotiation. This is far worse than a commercial order contract; it's just one party's coercion, a one-sided "contract."
　　I can't say the editors didn't use their brains. But if they've thought it all out, why don't they write it themselves and have to commission someone else to write it? I'm not very clear about what unspeakable difficulties there are in this.
　　However, judging from this kind of ordering, it's no wonder that the publications they run become increasingly monotonous and fewer and fewer people read them.
　　I don't object to planned commissioning and formulating topic selection plans, but don't do it at the expense of allowing authors to have independent thinking.

    约稿和订货
    康北海
    不知打谁起头，把约稿叫作“订货”。不知是词儿新鲜，还是因为它切合实际，“订货”说法叫开了。订货合同不但要载明交货日期，更重要的是载明货色的质量，比如分量的轻重、尺寸的长短等等。约稿，订的是文章之货，究竟和订做鞋子、水车不一样。可是，有的编辑却按经济工作人员订货的办法去约稿。给作者订好题目，还要把意思告诉一番；虽说供作者参考，也可说是编辑部的要求。最近我才知道，这还是客气的“订货”办法。
    我常给“小报”“小刊物”写点通俗文章。所碰到的几次不愉快的“订货”，却还是属于上述客气的一类。最近一个“大刊物”向我“订货”，不消说题目是早定了，连内容也有了。开头写什么、中间写什么……而且不是“供参考”，几乎没有商量的余地。这比商业性的订货合同还差的远，只是一方的强制，一方面的“合同”。
    不能不说编辑用了脑筋。可是，既然想好了，为什么不自己写，还要约别人来写呢？这其中究竟有什么难言的苦衷，我可不大了然。
    不过从这样的订货看来，就难怪他们主办的刊物越办越单调，越来越少有人看了。
    我并不反对有计划地组稿和拟定选题计划，可是，也不要为此而不让作者有独立思考的余地。
