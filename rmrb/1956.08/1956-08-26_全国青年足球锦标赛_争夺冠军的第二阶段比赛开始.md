    Second Stage of Competition for the Championship Begins
    (Our Dispatch) On the lush green turf of the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium, the nation's young football talents have begun the second stage of competition to vie for the 1956 championship title. The first match on the afternoon of the 25th was between the Beijing team and the Wuhan team. The Beijing team, with its faster forwards, repeatedly kicked the ball into the opponent's goal three times. The Wuhan team also had strong shooting ability, and they finally scored one goal. As a result, the Beijing team won with a score of three to one.
    Participating in the second stage of this National Youth Football Championship are representative teams from six cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Xi'an, and Chongqing. They are all the champion teams from the first stage of regional competitions.
    In previous Youth Football Championships, many talented emerging forces have been discovered, such as Zhang Junxiu, the goalkeeper of our national team today. Therefore, people in the sports field have high hopes for this competition. Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, He Long, Deputy Director Cai Tingkai, and others personally attended the opening ceremony of the 1956 National Youth Football Championship on the afternoon of the 25th and watched the match.

    本报讯　在绿草如茵的北京先农坛足球场上，全国青年足球能手们开始了争夺1956年冠军如号的第二阶段比赛。二十五日下午第一场比赛是北京队对武汉队，前锋速度较快的北京队，接连三次把球踢进对方球门；武汉队的射门能力也很强，他们最后踢进了一球，结果北京队以三比一取胜。
    参加这次全国青年足球锦标赛第二阶段比赛的有北京、上海、沈阳、武汉、西安、重庆等六个城市的代表队，他们都是第一阶段分区比赛的冠军队。
    在历届青年足球锦标赛中，曾发现不少很有天才的新生力量，像现在我国家代表队的守门员张俊秀就是其中的一个，因此，体育界人士对这次比赛寄以莫大希望。国务院副总理、中央体育运动委员会主任贺龙，副主任蔡廷锴等，都亲自出席了二十五日下午举行的1956年全国青年足球锦标赛的开幕式，并观看了比赛。　（王宜凯）
