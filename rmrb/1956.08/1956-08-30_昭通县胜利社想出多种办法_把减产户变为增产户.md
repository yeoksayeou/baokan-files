    Shengli Cooperative in Zhaotong County Devises Various Methods to Transform Households with Decreased Production into Households with Increased Production
    (Our newspaper’s dispatch from Kunming) The Shengli Cooperative in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province, fully mobilized the masses and conscientiously implemented the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," ensuring that over 98% of cooperative members increased their income. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations of the Shengli Cooperative for the entire year is estimated to be 310,000 yuan, an increase of 80% compared to last year. After deducting various expenses, 68% of the total income is directly distributed to the cooperative members. However, preliminary calculations on a household-by-household basis revealed that only 88.8% of the cooperative members had increased their income compared to last year; the income of some households with decreased income did not even meet the "three fix" standard for grain retention, resulting in accounts in arrears. After thorough deliberation at the cooperative members' meeting, various methods were devised to further increase grain production by 30,000 catties and save production costs by 4,000 yuan, which would guarantee that over 90% of the cooperative members increased their income. Based on this requirement, each unit formulated practical and feasible plans. For example, the coal mining team for sideline occupations was assigned the task of increasing production by 500 dan and saving 500 yuan; after repeated discussions among the team members, they believed that they could increase production by 800 dan. The female cooperative members also formulated specific plans to develop household sideline occupations, proposing the slogan "everyone has work to do, every household has sideline occupations." The cooperative cadres, on the one hand, appropriately arranged work based on the labor situation of these households with decreased production and accounts in arrears, organizing women who could not go out to crush oil cake and twist straw ropes; organizing the elderly to take care of the threshing ground and braid tobacco leaves, in order to increase their income. At the same time, they helped to resolve family disunity and the problem of women not participating in work, so that they could contribute more labor. Zhang Erxiu, a farmer among the households with decreased production, originally planned to earn 600 points for his entire family from June to the tenth day of the ninth lunar month, a period of over three months. However, due to increased enthusiasm for labor and the participation of women in work, he earned 320 points in June alone and is expected to earn 700 points. In addition, the remuneration for each workday has increased due to increased production and savings, so his family has changed from an originally calculated decrease of 25 yuan to an increase of 42 yuan. Due to the adoption of the above measures, households with decreased production have been reduced from the original 11.2% to 1.5%; there are also no more accounts in arrears.

    昭通县胜利社想出多种办法
    把减产户变为增产户
    本报昆明电　云南省昭通县胜利社充分发动群众，认真贯彻了“勤俭办社”方针，做到98％以上的社员增加收入。胜利社全年农副业的总收入估算为三十一万元，比去年增加了80％。扣除各项费用后，直接分给社员的占总收入的68％。但逐户试算结果，比去年增加收入的社员却只有88.8％；减少收入的社员有些户收入还达不到按“三定”留粮的标准，成为欠账户。在社员大会上经过充分酝酿，想各种办法，可以再增产粮食三万斤，节约生产成本四千元，这样就能保证90％以上的社员增加收入。根据这个要求，每个单位都订了切实可行的计划。如副业挖炭队，分给的任务是再增产五百担，节约五百元；经过队员反复讨论，可以增产八百担。妇女社员还订立了开展家庭副业的具体计划，提出“人人有活做，户户有副业”的口号。社干部们一面根据这些减产户和欠账户的劳动力情况，适当进行活路安排，把不能出门的妇女组织去冲油枯、搓草绳；把年老的人组织去照顾场院、编烟叶，以增加他们的收入。同时，帮助解决家庭不团结、妇女不出工的问题，使他们多出工。减产户中农张尔修，原计划农历6月到9月初十的三个多月全家挣六百分，由于提高了劳动积极性，妇女也出了工，6月份一个月就挣了三百二十分，预计还可挣到七百分。再加上增产节约后每个劳动日的报酬有了提高，这样，他家就从原计算的减产二十五元变成增产四十二元。由于采取了以上种种措施，减产户由原来的11.2％减少到1.5％；欠账户也没有了。
