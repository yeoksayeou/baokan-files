U.S. Military Bases in the Philippines

    Because the Filipino people resolutely oppose the U.S. military bases in the Philippines, the U.S. and the Philippines are negotiating to revise the "U.S.-Philippines Military Base Agreement" signed in 1947. According to this agreement, the Philippines provides the United States with twenty-three military bases for a term of ninety-nine years. In 1950, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement on expanding military bases.

    Currently, the United States has no fewer than forty military bases in the Philippines. These bases include barracks, naval ports, airfields, military warehouses, and communications, supply, and other military facilities. Most of the main bases are located within a hundred miles around Manila. Naval bases are centered on Manila Bay, and air force bases are centered on Clark in Pampanga Province; both major bases are in the northern part of the Philippine Islands, in central Luzon. In addition, the bases on Cebu Island and Mactan Island in the central Philippines control the vast area south of Luzon. Around the central bases are many smaller bases: Abali naval port in the northernmost part of the Philippine Islands, Tawi-Tawi base at the southern end, army, navy, and air force bases on Palawan Island in the west, and Guiuan naval and air force base in Leyte Gulf at the eastern end. Recently, according to the United Press, the United States has built a huge naval air station at Cubi Point, about fifty miles northwest of Manila. In short, throughout the Philippine Islands, almost all strategically important areas are occupied by the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.

    The United States' occupation of a large number of military bases in the Philippines is primarily to control the Philippines, in order to maintain its colonial privileges in the Philippines, and to prevent the Philippines from obtaining complete independence. At the same time, the United States has also taken a fancy to the strategic value of the Philippines in the entire Far East, attempting to turn the Philippines into a major military base for the United States to invade Southeast Asia. U.S. bourgeois political commentator Walter Lippmann once said: "After the United States occupied the Philippines, it became the geographical center of the Southeast Asian empire and also occupied its strategic transportation center."

    The U.S. occupation of a large number of military bases on Philippine soil seriously violates Philippine sovereignty. U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell repeatedly declared in 1953 and 1954 that the United States owns these bases; not long ago, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Thomas publicly stated that the issue of U.S. base ownership in the Philippines needs to be submitted to the U.S. President for review.

    U.S. bases in the Philippines occupy a large amount of land from the Filipino people, leaving many farmers with no means of livelihood. U.S. troops enjoy various privileges in the base areas, far exceeding extraterritorial rights. They can arbitrarily appoint mayors, levy exorbitant taxes, establish military checkpoints on highways, interfere in the functions of local Philippine governments, and arbitrarily expel Filipinos and confiscate their property. They even arbitrarily wrote these privileges into "management regulations." This situation is becoming increasingly intolerable to the Filipino people.

    In order to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, the Filipino people have always opposed the U.S. retaining military bases in the Philippines. In order to ease the anti-American sentiment of the Filipino people, U.S. Vice President Nixon recently stated during his visit to the Philippines that the United States recognizes Philippine sovereignty over the military bases, but he also proposed "providing more land" to the United States for military bases. This shows that the United States has no intention of changing its colonialist and arrogant attitude towards the Philippines.

### 美国在菲律宾的军事基地

    美国在菲律宾的军事基地
    由于菲律宾人民坚决反对美国在菲律宾的军事基地，美国和菲律宾正在进行谈判，讨论修改1947年签订的“美菲军事基地协定”。根据这个协定，菲律宾供给美国军事基地二十三处，使用期限为九十九年。1950年，美国和菲律宾曾签订了关于扩充军事基地的协定。
    目前，美国在菲律宾的军事基地不下四十处。这些基地包括兵营、军港、飞机场、军用仓库以及通讯、供应和其它军事设施。主要基地大部分分布在马尼拉周围一百英里以内。海军基地以马尼拉湾为中心，空军基地以邦邦加省的克拉克为中心；这两个主要基地都在菲律宾群岛的北部、吕宋岛的中央。另外，还有菲律宾群岛中部的宿务岛和麦克丹岛的基地控制着吕宋岛以南的广阔地区。在中心基地的周围有许多较小的基地：菲律宾群岛的最北部有阿巴利军港，南端有塔维塔维基地，西面有巴拉望岛上的陆海空军基地，东端则有雷伊泰湾的贵安海空军基地。最近，据合众社透露，美国在马尼拉西北约五十英里的库比岬又建成了一个巨大的海军航空站。总之，在整个菲律宾群岛上，几乎所有具有重要战略意义的地区，都被美国陆海空军占据了。
    美国在菲律宾占据大量军事基地，首先是为了控制菲律宾，以便保持它在菲律宾的殖民特权，使菲律宾不能得到完整的独立。同时，美国也看中了菲律宾在整个远东地区的战略价值，企图把菲律宾变成美国侵略东南亚的主要军事基地。美国资产阶级政论家李普曼就说过：“美国占领菲律宾后，就成了东南亚帝国的地理中心，同时也占了它的战略交通中心。”
    美国在菲律宾土地上占有大量军事基地，严重地侵犯了菲律宾的主权。美国司法部长赫伯特·布朗纳尔在1953年和1954年几次宣称美国对这些基地拥有所有权；不久以前，美国海军部长托马斯公开声明，菲律宾的美国基地所有权问题需要提交美国总统审核。
    美国在菲律宾的基地占据了菲律宾人民的大量土地，使许多农民无以为生。美军在基地区域享有种种特权，远远超过了治外法权。他们可以任意任命市长，征收苛捐杂税，在公路上设立军事检查站，干涉菲律宾地方政府的职权，随便驱逐菲律宾人和没收菲律宾人的财产。他们甚至把这些特权擅自写成“管理条例”。这种情形使菲律宾人民日益感到不能容忍。
    菲律宾人民为了维护自己的独立和主权，一直反对美国在菲律宾保有军事基地。为了缓和菲律宾人民的反美情绪，最近美国副总统尼克松在访问菲律宾的时候表示，美国承认菲律宾对军事基地的主权，但是又提出了“提供更多的土地”给美国作军事基地的要求。这说明美国根本不想改变它对菲律宾的殖民主义者的横蛮态度。
