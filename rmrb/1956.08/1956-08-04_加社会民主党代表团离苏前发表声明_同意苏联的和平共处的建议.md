    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Canadian Social Democratic Party delegation left Moscow on the 1st to return home.

    At a press conference held on July 31st, delegation leader Irvin read a statement on behalf of the delegation, saying, "We, these Canadian Social Democrats, welcome the words of First Secretary Khrushchev in his report to the 20th Party Congress. Indeed, socialists in other countries can gain the power to build a socialist society through elections and in accordance with the traditions and circumstances of each country. This is precisely what socialists in Canada are striving to do."

    "At the same time, we, as socialists in a capitalist country who have not yet come to power, agree with your proposal for peaceful coexistence. We believe that peace is the first goal that should be sought and achieved in the program of our time."

    "To this end, we join the Soviet Union in opposing the continued testing of atomic weapons; we oppose the use of such weapons as a means of resolving international disputes."

    These representatives from the Social Democratic Party organization of Alberta, Canada, arrived in the Soviet Union in early July.

    The statement by the Canadian guests also said, "We came to the Soviet Union as friends, and we have received friendship. We believe that if countries treat each other with a friendly spirit in their dealings with Russia, they themselves will be treated with friendship."

    "We do not want to say that everything in the Soviet Union is perfect. If we did, the people here would be the first to deny it."

    加社会民主党代表团离苏前发表声明
    同意苏联的和平共处的建议
    据新华社讯　加拿大社会民主党代表团在一日离开莫斯科回国。
    在七月三十一日举行的记者招待会上，代表团团长伊尔文在以代表团名义宣读的一项声明中说，“我们这些加拿大的社会民主党人，欢迎第一书记赫鲁晓夫向第二十次党代表大会作的报告中所说的话。事实上，其他国家的社会主义者可以用选举的方法并且按照各国的传统和情况取得建设社会主义社会的权力。这正是加拿大的社会主义者正在努力做的”。
    “同时，我们作为资本主义国家中没有取得政权的社会主义者同意你们的和平共处的建议。我们相信，和平是我们这个时代的纲领中应该谋求和实现的第一个目标”。
    “为此，我们和苏联一起反对继续试验原子武器；我们反对把这种武器用作解决国际分歧的手段”。
    这些来自加拿大阿尔伯达省社会民主党组织的代表们是七月上旬到达苏联的。
    加拿大客人的声明还说，“我们是作为朋友到苏联来的，我们也得到了友谊。我们认为，如果各国在它们同俄国来往中本着友好的精神待人，它们自己也会得到友好的对待”。
    “我们并不想说苏联的一切东西都十全十美了。如果我们这样说，这里的人是会首先加以否认的。”
