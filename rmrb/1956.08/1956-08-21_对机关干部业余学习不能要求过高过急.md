Excessive Demands and Haste Should Be Avoided in the Spare-Time Studies of Government Cadres
Zheng Siyuan

Currently, the enthusiasm of staff members, particularly young staff members, of central government agencies to advance towards science is extremely high, and they urgently request that Party organizations and administrations in the agencies strengthen their leadership and assistance. According to preliminary information, 30% of the young staff members of units such as the Ministry of Higher Education and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have drawn up individual self-improvement plans; about 50% of the young staff members of six units such as the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade have drawn up individual self-improvement plans; and 90% of the young staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have drawn up one-year individual self-improvement plans. Hundreds of business-specific research groups and scientific research groups voluntarily organized by agency staff members have already been established; some industrial departments have already started regular spare-time night universities and night secondary technical schools for agency staff members; and some units have started spare-time political schools for cadres to study Marxist-Leninist theory. In short, the atmosphere of learning within the agencies is very high, which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. However, in the current wave of learning among agency staff members to advance towards science, there has been a phenomenon of excessive study workload, excessive demands, and a uniform approach regardless of the individual, resulting in agency staff members being "overwhelmed and suffering from indigestion." This will inevitably affect the normal operation of the agency's administrative work and the health of the staff members.

This phenomenon of excessive demands, haste, and a uniform approach stems, on the one hand, from the leadership, which assigns an excessive workload for theoretical, professional, and cultural studies, demands too much too quickly, and insists on a uniform approach; on the other hand, it stems from the cadres themselves, who are eager to advance towards science, do not start from their own actual situation, treat wishes as reality, and make overly ambitious personal self-improvement plans. For example, one young cadre who graduated from an industrial technical school in 1954 and is now working on technical quota budgeting has drawn up a personal self-improvement plan that requires him to learn English, French, Russian, Japanese, and German within ten years, obtain a doctorate in technical research within twelve years, and in the field of literature, master the literary masterpieces of the world's five greatest literary figures, such as Pushkin and Shakespeare, within seven years, and reach the level of a writer, with a long poem and two novels published by 1967. Some comrades also demand too much of themselves regarding the amount of spare time they can devote to studying each day. For example, one young cadre with a junior high school education in a certain industrial department plans to study six courses simultaneously in his spare time, getting up at five o'clock in the morning and going to bed at eleven o'clock at night, and studying for ten hours on Sundays, with his weekly spare time exceeding thirty hours. If this continues for a long time, it will inevitably affect his assigned work and his own health.

The studies of on-the-job cadres in agencies are part-time in nature. This means that agencies are not schools after all. The primary task of an agency is work, and the secondary task is study. After working hard for eight hours, how much spare time can a staff member of a state agency actually devote to studying each day? Generally speaking, the minimum is an average of one hour per day, for example, some older cadres, cadres in poor health, and cadres with many children and heavy housework; ordinary cadres can devote an average of two hours per day to spare-time studies; and some young cadres without family burdens may even be able to devote an average of three hours per day to spare-time studies. Therefore, we should make different study demands based on the different situations of different cadres, and it is not appropriate to insist on a uniform approach, nor should we demand too much or too quickly.

In terms of study methods and approaches, attention should be paid to diversity and flexibility. Taking the theoretical study of agency staff members as an example, running spare-time political schools is a good way to study, but it is by no means the only way. Even after spare-time political schools in agencies are generally established, the study methods of theoretical study groups and individual self-study among agency staff members will continue to exist for a long time, and this method is still more suitable for some cadres with a higher level of theoretical knowledge. As for the professional studies of agency staff members, at present, at least the following types of study methods should be allowed to be carried out simultaneously in the agencies. These methods are: (1) Regular spare-time colleges and secondary vocational schools, such as the spare-time night universities and spare-time secondary technical schools that have already been established by units such as the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, as well as the "special classes" that specifically teach basic knowledge of enterprise management to veteran cadres. This is certainly a good way to study, but due to the difficulty of obtaining teachers and equipment, it is currently impossible to establish such schools on a large scale. (2) Using small-scale training courses for professional studies, for example, fifteen cadres from the Central Institute of Hygiene of the Ministry of Health voluntarily organized themselves to study chemistry, and they hired eight comrades from their unit with expertise in chemistry as volunteer teachers, with each teacher averaging one lecture every two months. The advantage of this study method is that it is closely integrated with the needs of business work, solves the problem of teachers locally, is short, concise, and easy to implement, and should be greatly promoted. (3) Using the method of summarizing practical work experience to carry out scientific research work, such as the scientific research group on "Seed Grain Storage Problems" of the Grain Storage Bureau of the Ministry of Food; the scientific research group on "Printing and Dyeing Factory Building Design" of the Design Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry; the research group on "Cement Conservation" of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways; and the scientific research group on "Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce" of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, all belong to this type. (4) Using individual self-study or correspondence courses, etc.

In short, leading and organizing the studies of agency staff members is a very complex and meticulous ideological and organizational work, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of leading agencies and the masses at all levels, and adapt to the characteristics of the agencies in terms of study requirements and methods, so that agency staff members can complete their study tasks competently and happily, and that the enthusiasm of agency staff members for learning can be persistently maintained.

    对机关干部业余学习不能要求过高过急
    郑思远
    目前，中央国家机关工作人员，特别是青年工作人员向科学进军的热情十分高涨，迫切要求机关党组织和行政加强对他们的领导与帮助。根据初步了解，高等教育部和全国合作总社等单位的青年工作人员有30％的人订出了个人进修计划；煤炭工业部、林业部、对外贸易部等六个单位的青年工作人员有50％左右的人订出了个人进修计划；外交部有90％的青年工作人员订出了个人一年的进修计划。由机关干部自愿组织起来的业务专题研究小组和科学研究小组已经有成百个；有一些工业部门已经为机关干部举办起正规的业余夜间大学和夜间中等技术学校；有一些单位为干部学习马克思列宁主义理论办起了业余政治学校。总之，机关内学习空气十分高涨，确实是一个可喜的现象。但是，目前机关干部在向科学进军的学习热潮中，已经产生了学习分量过重、要求过急和不分别对象强求一律的现象，结果使得机关干部“疲于奔命，消化不良”。这样势必影响到机关行政工作的正常进行和干部身体的健康。
    这种要求过高、过急和强求一律的现象，一方面是来自领导，对理论、业务、文化学习的布置分量过重，要求太急，强求一律；另一方面是来自干部本身，向科学进军心切，不从本身的实际情况出发，把愿望当实际，个人订的进修规划太高。例如有一位1954年刚从工业专科学校毕业的青年干部，他现在作技术定额的预算工作，他订了一个个人进修规划，要求在十年内学会英、法、俄、日、德五国文字，十二年内在技术研究上取得博士学位，七年内在文学方面精读普希金、莎士比亚等世界五大文豪的文学巨著，并使自己达到作家的水平，到1967年有一篇长诗和两部长篇小说出版问世。有些同志，对个人每天能抽出的业余学习时间，也有点要求太高，例如，某工业部门有一位初中文化水平的青年干部，他计划业余同时学习六门课程，每天早晨五点钟起床，晚上十一点钟睡觉，星期天也要学习十个小时，每周业余学习的时间超过三十小时以上。长此下去，必然会影响他所担负的岗位工作和他自己的身体。
    机关在职干部学习是业余性质的。这就是说，机关毕竟不是学校。机关的首要任务是工作，其次才是学习。国家机关的一个工作人员，当着他紧张地工作了八个小时以后，每天究竟能抽出多少业余时间进行学习呢？一般地说，最少的，平均每天可以抽出一个小时，例如一些年龄较大、身体较弱和一些子女多、家务繁重的干部；普通干部，平均每天可以抽两个小时的时间进行业余学习；一些年青和无家室之累的干部，甚至平均每天可能抽出三个小时进行业余学习。因此，我们应当根据不同干部的不同情况，提出不同的学习要求，不宜强求一律，也不能要求得过高、过急。
    在学习方式和方法上，应注意多样性和灵活性。拿机关干部理论学习来说，举办业余政治学校是一种很好的学习方式，但决不是唯一的方式。即使机关业余政治学校普遍建立起来以后，机关干部理论学习小组和个人自修的学习方式，还会长期存在，这种方式对一些理论水平较高的干部还是较为适宜的学习方式。至于机关干部的业务学习，目前，最少应当允许下述几种学习方式在机关中同时开展起来。这几种方式是：（一）正规的业余高等学校和中等专业学校，例如第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部和冶金工业部等单位已经举办起来的业余夜大学和业余中等技术学校，以及专门给老干部学习企业管理基本知识的“特别班”等。这当然是一种很好的学习方式，但限于师资和设备的困难，目前还不可能大量建立这类学校。（二）采用小型学习班进行业务学习，例如，卫生部中央卫生研究院有十五个干部自愿组织起来学习化学，他们聘请了本单位八位对化学有素养的同志作义务教员，每个教员平均每两个月才分担一次讲课。这个学习方式的好处是：密切结合业务工作的需要，就地解决师资问题，短小精干，简单易行，应当大大提倡。（三）采用总结实际工作经验的方法，进行科学研究工作，例如粮食部仓储局“种子粮保管问题”科学研究小组；纺织工业部设计公司“印染厂厂房设计”科学研究小组；铁道部工程总局“水泥节约”研究小组；工商行政管理局“对私营工商业改造”的科学研究小组，都是属于这一类型。（四）采用各人自修或函授方式等。
    总之，领导和组织机关干部学习，是一件很复杂和细致的思想工作与组织工作，必须充分发挥各级领导机关和群众的积极性与主动性，在学习要求和方式方法上适应机关的特点，才可能使机关干部胜任愉快地完成学习任务，才有可能使机关干部的学习热情顽强持久地坚持下去。
