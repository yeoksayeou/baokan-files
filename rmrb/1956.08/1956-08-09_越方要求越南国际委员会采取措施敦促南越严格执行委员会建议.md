    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has requested the International Commission for Vietnam to take more forceful measures to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to strictly implement the Commission's various recommendations. This request was made in a letter from the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission on July 27th.
    The letter stated that since January of this year, after the Vietnam People's Army filed a complaint, the International Commission decided to investigate seven incidents of the South Vietnamese authorities violating the Geneva Accords. However, the South Vietnamese authorities either avoided answering or used the excuse of "insecurity" to obstruct the mobile teams of the International Commission from carrying out their tasks. The International Commission has made six recommendations to the other side, but to date, none of the recommendations have been implemented.
    The letter pointed out that this behavior of the other side has had a negative impact on the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and on the activities of the International Commission. It also shows that the French Federation and the South Vietnamese authorities deliberately refuse to cooperate effectively with the International Commission, thereby violating the relevant provisions of the Geneva Accords and the spirit of the May 8th letter from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

    越方要求越南国际委员会采取措施敦促南越严格执行委员会建议
    新华社河内8日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国要求越南国际委员会采取更加有力的措施，敦促南越当局严格执行委员会的各项建议。这个要求是越南人民军总司令部联络代表团七月二十七日在给国际委员会的一封信中提出来的。
    这封信说，从今年一月以来，国际委员会在越南人民军提出控告以后，曾经决定对南越当局违反日内瓦协议的七起事件进行调查。但是，南越当局不是避不作答，就是利用“不安全”的借口来阻挠国际委员会的机动小组执行自己的任务。国际委员会曾经六次向对方提出建议，但是到现在为止，一项建议都没有得到实现。
    信件指出，对方这种行为对于日内瓦协议的继续实行和对国际委员会的活动都产生了不良的影响，并且说明法兰西联邦方面和南越当局蓄意拒绝同国际委员会进行有效的合作，从而违背了日内瓦协定有关条款的规定和日内瓦会议两位主席五月八日信件的精神。
