    Letting Houses Sit Empty Instead of Letting People Live in Them
    Since 1953, the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau has built over 20,000 square meters of family dormitories and thousands of square meters of cadre dormitories. Calculating by the number of employees, it should be more than enough. However, due to unreasonable regulations, the housing problem for employees has not been resolved. For example, the regulations stipulate that staff below the section chief level and workers below grade four are not provided with housing, making it impossible to solve the housing difficulties of these employees. After the Black Fish Gully dormitory was built in 1954, more than 40 rooms were often left empty, and they were not allocated to employees outside the "system" who urgently needed housing. The housing management department's enforcement of the regulations is "strict" to this extent: Wang Wentian, in his thirties, just found a partner and wanted to temporarily borrow a public house to live in for a period of time, but the housing management section did not allow it, declaring that if he moved in without permission, they would throw his belongings out and send him to the Public Security Bureau. Someone sympathized with Wang Wentian and was willing to temporarily lend him his public house, but the comrade in charge of housing did not allow it either.

    空着房子不让住
    杨家杖子矿务局从1953年以来，先后建立了两万多平方公尺家属宿舍和数千平方公尺干部宿舍，按职工人数计算，满可以够用了。但是由于制度不合理，职工住宅问题还是没有解决。例如制度中规定股长以下的职员和四级以下的工人不给房子住，这些职工的住宅困难就无法解决。黑鱼沟宿舍从1954年建成后，经常空着四十多间也不分配给在“制度”以外的急需房子的职工。房产管理部门执行制度居然“严格”到这样的程度：三十多岁的王文田刚找到一个爱人，想暂借公家的房子住一个时期，房产管理股不允许，声言不经允许住进去就把东西扔出去，把人送公安局。有人同情王文田，愿意把自己住的公家的房子暂时借给他住，管房子的同志也不准。    　　赵长青
