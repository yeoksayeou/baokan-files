    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from London: The twenty-two nation conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue is scheduled to open in London at 10:00 AM today. According to the British side, all meetings will be closed-door, and it is expected that the conference will last about a week.
    On August 15th, the eve of the conference, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd had a particularly busy day. On this day, he met and consulted with the foreign ministers of more than a dozen countries participating in the conference. According to a United Press report: "The British are rushing to carry out all diplomatic activities in a desperate attempt to get everyone to support their demand: to make Egypt accept international control of the Suez Canal."
    At noon on this day, Lloyd met with French Foreign Minister Pineau and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, and together they met with British Prime Minister Eden. Western news agencies pointed out that the purpose of their talks was to bridge the differences between the three countries on the Suez Canal issue and form a "solid front", and to reach a consensus on the joint plan for the internationalization of the Suez Canal that the three countries are preparing to submit to the conference. It is reported that news of the "wavering" U.S. attitude has alarmed British officials.
    Reuters correspondent Rankin in Washington pointed out that Dulles has a "dual task" at the London conference. He must act as a "mediator" and at the same time express that the United States is a "firm ally" of Britain and France. Rankin pointed out that because of the lack of public support, "Dulles has so far advocated not using force" and "openly emphasized that the United States has not undertaken new obligations in this regard." On the other hand, he also defended the military threats taken by Britain and France against Egypt. It was revealed that during the three-nation foreign ministers' meeting on the 15th, Dulles once again assured Britain and France of his support for the principle of "international control" of the Suez Canal.
    From Western news agency reports, it can be seen that the policy that the United States will follow at the meeting is: resolutely advocate finding some kind of "international operation and management" plan for the Suez Canal, while paying attention to "flexibility of attitude."
    On the same day, the foreign ministers of the three Nordic countries, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, also held a meeting to discuss adopting a common attitude at the London conference. The meeting decided that the three countries agreed to establish some kind of independent international organization to manage the Suez Canal, but they did not approve of any suggestions to use force to implement any decisions made at the London conference.

    伦敦会议前夕会外活动频繁
    英国拚命设法寻找对国际管制主张的支持者
    北欧三国外长不赞成使用武力来执行会议决定
    新华社16日讯　伦敦消息：讨论苏彝士运河问题的二十二国会议预定在今天上午十时在伦敦开幕。据英国方面宣布，全部会议都将是秘密会议，预计这个会议将要进行一周左右。
    在会议开幕前夕的八月十五日，英国外交大臣劳埃德度过了特别繁忙的一天。这一天，他同参加会议的十几个国家的外交部长分别会见，并且进行了商谈。合众社消息说：“英国人这样慌忙进行一切外交活动，是要拚命设法使大家都支持他们的要求：使埃及接受对苏彝士运河的国际管制。”
    在这一天中午，劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺、美国国务卿杜勒斯举行了会谈并且一同会见了英国首相艾登。西方通讯社消息指出，他们会谈的目的在于弥补三国在苏彝士运河问题上的意见分歧而形成
  “坚固的阵线”，并且在三国准备向会议提出的关于苏彝士运河国际化的联合计划上取得一致意见。据报道，关于美国态度“摇摆不定”的消息已经使英国官方感到惊惶。
    路透社驻华盛顿记者兰金指出，杜勒斯在伦敦会议上有“双重任务”，他既要扮作“调解人”，又要表示美国是英法的“坚定的盟国”。兰金指出，因为没有取得舆论的支持，所以“到现在为止杜勒斯主张不使用武力”，并且“公开强调美国在这一方面没有承担新的义务”。另一方面，他也为英法对埃及采取的军事威胁行动辩护。据透露，在十五日的三国外长会谈中，杜勒斯再一次向英法保证支持“国际管制”苏彝士运河的原则。
    从西方通讯社的报道中可以看到，美国在会上将要遵循的方针是：坚决主张找出某种“国际经营和管理”苏彝士运河的方案，同时要注意“态度的灵活性”。
    在同一天，北欧的挪威、丹麦和瑞典三国外交大臣也举行了会议，讨论在伦敦会议上采取共同态度的问题。会议决定三国同意设立某种独立的管理苏彝士运河的国际机构，但是他们不赞成使用武力来执行伦敦会议作出的任何决定的任何建议。
