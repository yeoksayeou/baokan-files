　　In summer, herds of mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys appear on the green felt of Mount Wutai. On the flat summit of the mountain, 2500-3200 meters above sea level, where the mountain merges with the sky, the herdsmen sing mountain songs and whistle, riding swift horses to drive the scattered cattle and horses in all directions.

　　Mount Wutai has a cool climate, with flat pastures full of green grass and streams on the summit and slopes. Every summer, when the livestock are idle, farmers from more than ten counties in Shanxi, including Xin, Guo, Ying, and Hebei Province, including Fu Ping, send their livestock here for grazing. More than five thousand head of livestock have now been sent here. In order to strengthen the leadership of the pasture and overcome the chaotic situation of previous years, the Wutai County People's Committee organized experienced local herdsmen in advance, equipped them with pasture cadres, divided the pastoral areas, and assigned veterinarians with better skills.

　　Based on past experience, the herdsmen divided the livestock into groups for grazing, and the livestock grew very quickly. A red horse from Douzui Agricultural Cooperative in Xin County was very thin when it first arrived, but in less than half a month, it gained two fingers of fat.

    五台山上的牧场
    夏天，在五台山的绿色草毡上，出现了一群群的骡、马、牛、驴。牧工们在这拔海2500—3200公尺的山天相联的平坦台顶上，高唱着山歌，呼啸着口哨，骑在飞快的骏马上四下驱逐着散群的牛马。
    五台山气候凉爽，在台顶和山腰中都有平坦的牧场，到处是青草和水溪。每当暑夏畜闲的时候，山西忻县、崞县、应县以及河北省阜平等十余县的农民，就把牲畜寄养到这里来放牧。现在各地已经寄养了五千多头牲口。五台县人民委员会为了加强牧场领导，克服往年的混乱现象，事先就组织了当地有经验的牧工，配备了牧场干部，划分了牧区，并调配了技术较好的兽医。
    牧工们根据往年的经验，把寄养的牲畜分群牧放，牲畜长得很快，忻县陡嘴农业社一匹红马，初来时很瘦弱，过了不到半个月，就长了两指膘。（赵文正、郝全珠、赵瑞）
