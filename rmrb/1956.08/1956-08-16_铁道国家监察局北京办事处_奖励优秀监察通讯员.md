Xinhua News Agency, August 15th. The Beijing Railway Office of the National Railway Inspectorate recently held its first Supervisory Correspondents Representative Conference, where it rewarded thirty-two supervisory correspondents and two supervisory correspondent groups.

The Beijing Railway Office of the National Railway Inspectorate currently has 909 people's supervisory correspondents. These people's supervisory correspondents actively put forward suggestions for improvement in their work, oppose waste, and protect state property. Tang Yimin, a people's supervisory correspondent at the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, once discovered that the disassembly inspectors in the vehicle dismantling workshop were careless in their work, treating all usable bottom doors as waste and loading them onto trains for transport. Tang Yimin immediately reported this to the inspection office. After the inspection office sent someone to appraise them, it was found that most of the bottom doors could still be used after repair. This avoided a loss of more than 500 yuan in value. Sun Mingshun, head of the tool section of the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Depot and a people's supervisory correspondent, when reviewing the section's production and financial implementation plan for the first quarter of this year, based on the universal feedback from employees and according to the coal saving situation in the boiler room last year, actively reflected opinions to the inspectors and helped the inspectors expose the irrationality in this target. According to preliminary calculations, in the two items of passenger car heating and production fuel, coal consumption could be reduced by more than 116 tons. Sun Ying, who is now the chief accountant at the Changxindian Factory Hospital, has been selected as a people's supervisory correspondent since 1953, and has been paying attention to fighting against all bad phenomena at all times and places. For example, she once felt that the hospital's transportation expenses were too large, and that there were some problems with the charges for using ambulances for employees' family members. She promptly reported this to the inspection office and the factory's chief accountant, requesting an inspection. As a result of the inspection, the fact that Yang Liming, the factory's general affairs director, had embezzled more than 200 yuan was clarified.

At the Supervisory Correspondents Representative Conference, a proposal was also put forward to strive to be an excellent people's supervisory correspondent. The proposal emphasized that people's supervisory correspondents should actively strive for the leadership and support of the Party and the supervisory organs, and promptly reflect and solve problems so that people's supervisory correspondents can become strong assistants to the supervisory organs.

    铁道国家监察局北京办事处
    奖励优秀监察通讯员
    据新华社15日讯　铁道国家监察局北京铁路办事处最近召开的第一届监察通讯员代表大会上，奖励了三十二个监察通讯员和两个监察通讯员小组。
    铁道国家监察局北京铁路办事处目前已有909名人民监察通讯员。这些人民监察通讯员在工作中积极提出改进意见，反对浪费，保护国家资财。唐山机车车辆修理工厂人民监察通讯员唐义民，一次发现车辆解体车间分解检查员工作上粗枝大叶，把可以用的底开门全部作为废物，装上火车准备运走。唐义民当即报告监察室。经监察室派人鉴定，大部分底开门经过修理还可以使用。这样就避免了价值五百多元的损失浪费。石家庄车辆段工具工段长、人民监察通讯员孙明顺在今年元月份审查工段第一季度的生产财务执行计划时，根据职工的普遍反映并且根据锅炉房去年节约用煤的情况积极向监察员反映意见，帮助监察员揭发了这项指标中的不合理现象。经初步计算，在客车取暖和生产用燃料的两项科目中，就可以削减用煤116吨多。现在长辛店工厂医院任主任会计员的孙颖，从1953年开始被选为人民监察通讯员以来，随时随地都在注意向一切不良现象作斗争。例如她曾经感到医院运输费用过于庞大，对职工家属使用救护车的收费有些问题，她便及时向监察室和工厂总会计报告，要求进行检查。经检查结果，弄清了工厂总务主任杨立明贪污二百多元的事实。
    在监察通讯员代表大会上还提出了一项为争取作一个优秀的人民监察通讯员的倡议书。倡议书中着重地提出，人民监察通讯员应当主动争取党和监察机关的领导和支持，发现问题及时反映和解决，使人民监察通讯员能成为监察机关强有力的助手。
