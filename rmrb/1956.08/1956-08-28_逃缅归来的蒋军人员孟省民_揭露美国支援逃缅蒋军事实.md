    Meng Shengmin, A Chiang Kai-shek Soldier Who Returned from Burma,
    Exposes the Fact that the United States Supported the Chiang Kai-shek Remnants Fleeing to Burma
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 27th (By Xinhua Special Correspondent Shang Wen) - Meng Shengmin, the former radio station chief of the Chiang Kai-shek army who fled to Burma, who is currently visiting Kunming, revealed to reporters the evil activities of the United States in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma and sending special agents to the Chinese mainland.
    Meng Shengmin listed his own experiences and the facts he witnessed. He said: When I received special training in confidential communications in Tamsui, Taiwan, it was under the control of American military instructors. This place specifically trains personnel to be sent to the Chinese mainland for so-called "guerrilla activities." After the training, at 2:00 PM on December 20, 1951, more than sixty of us Taiwanese military personnel were sent onto two American planes, which took off from Songshan Airport in Taipei. After refueling at Manila Airport in the Philippines, the planes flew over Malaya overnight and landed in Chiang Mai, Thailand. At this time, an American sent us out of the Thai border to Mong Hsat in Burma. Mong Hsat was then the location of the headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma. After living there for more than a month, some of us were assigned to areas near the border of our motherland to carry out activities, until I left this time. Meng Shengmin said: When we left Taiwan, we were equipped with American-made hand-cranked transceivers and pre-prepared American 147A, 147B, and 147G secret writing powders. American planes and Americans mostly carried out the activities of sending us at night, extremely secretly.
    Meng Shengmin said: The source of weapons for the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma was partly airdropped by American planes, which dropped semi-heavy machine guns and carbines at "New Place"; another part was Mauser rifles and rifles transported from Taiwan. In early 1952, Americans also opened the "Mong Hsat Training Class" in the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma. Americans often went to the training class to teach, promote the Third World War, and encourage the Chiang Kai-shek army personnel fleeing to Burma to "counterattack the mainland." Meng Shengmin said: In order to cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world, the Taiwan side once transferred Li Mi back to Taiwan, but at the same time renamed the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma as the "Southeast Asia Free People's Anti-Communist Allied Army," and later changed it to the "Yunnan People's Anti-Communist Volunteer Army." Until now, Taiwan still remits 490,000 baht to the Chiang Kai-shek army fleeing to Burma every month.
    Meng Shengmin finally told reporters: Since the motherland proposed the call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, most of the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers who fled to Burma hope to be able to return to the motherland and reunite with their relatives as soon as possible, and live a peaceful and happy life. Meng Shengmin also said: I was a person who took the wrong path in the past. In the mountainous areas of northern Burma, I felt that following the Americans was a dead end, and the future was pessimistic and dim. After I heard the broadcast of Premier Zhou's report, I mustered up the courage to return to the embrace of the motherland on July 20. The warm reception of the people of the motherland made me very grateful.

    逃缅归来的蒋军人员孟省民
    揭露美国支援逃缅蒋军事实
    新华社昆明27日电　新华社特约记者尚文报道：正在昆明参观的逃缅蒋军电台台长孟省民向记者揭发了美国支持逃缅蒋军和向我国大陆派遣特务的罪恶活动。
    孟省民列举了他本身的经历和目睹的事实。他说：我在台湾淡水受保密通讯特殊训练时，是在美国军事教官的控制下进行的。这里专门训练向中国大陆派遣所谓“游击活动”的人员。训练结束后，在1951年12月20日下午2时，我们六十多个台湾军事人员被送上两架美国飞机，从台北松山机场起飞。飞机在菲律宾马尼拉机场着陆加油后，就连夜飞越马来亚上空，经过泰国曼谷降落在清迈。这时，有一个美国人把我们送出泰国边境到了缅甸的勐萨。勐萨当时是逃缅蒋军总部所在地。在那里住了一个多月，我们一部分人就被分配到靠近祖国边境的地区进行活动，一直到我这次离开。孟省民说：当我们离开台湾时，配备我们有美国制造的手摇收发报机和已经配制好的美国147A、147B和147G等密写药粉。美国飞机和美国人遣送我们的活动多是在夜间进行的，极为秘密。
    孟省民说：逃缅蒋军的武器来源，一部分是美国派飞机空投的，曾在“新地方”投下有半重式机枪和卡宾枪等；另外一部分是从台湾运去的马枪和步枪。1952年初美国人还在逃缅蒋军中开办“勐萨训练班”，美国人经常到训练班去上课，宣传第三次世界大战，鼓动逃缅蒋军人员“反攻大陆”。孟省民说：为了掩盖世界人民的耳目，台湾方面曾把李弥调回台湾，但同时又把逃缅蒋军改称为“东南亚自由人民反共联军”，后又改为“云南人民反共志愿军”。直到现在，台湾还每月汇拨给逃缅蒋军经费四十九万铢。
    孟省民最后告诉记者说：自从祖国提出和平解放台湾的号召以后，逃缅的蒋军官兵大多数都希望能够早日回到祖国和亲人们团圆，过和平安乐的日子。孟省民还说：我过去是一个走错了路的人，在缅北山区里，我感到跟着美国人走是绝路一条，前途悲观暗淡。我听到了周总理的报告的广播后，才鼓足勇气在7月20日回到祖国怀抱。祖国人民的热情接待，使我非常感激。
