    Merger of Cooperatives (9)
    Adapted by: Tu Honghen, Drawn by: Jiang Ying
    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    33　Li Baichuan convened a meeting of cooperative members and was giving an exaggerated speech, which infuriated the members of the Second Cooperative. One said: "Slander! Why should we benefit from them? We'll uproot the apple trees tomorrow!" Another said: "Let's break up with them as soon as possible!" Yinghua was startled by the noisy uproar.
    34　Yinghua became increasingly anxious. She suddenly saw Gui Xia wringing her hands against the wall and rushed over to ask her. Gui Xia said that she had just arrived too. Looking towards the lamplight by the table, she saw her father and two accountants going through the accounting books. Only Party member Zhao Laojin was sighing, stamping his feet, and pacing around.
    35　Yinghua squeezed over to ask Zhao Laojin. Li Baichuan saw her at a glance and immediately told Yinghua to go home and get the documents. Yinghua had no choice but to respond, retreating into the shadows, quietly pulling on the back of Zhao Laojin's clothes, and telling him to oppose uprooting the apple trees.
    36　Before Zhao Laojin could finish speaking, Li Baichuan interrupted him: "We all have to go through democracy! Laojin, do you oppose or support the opinions of the masses?" Laojin was stunned. Suddenly, a scream came: "Fire!" The meeting place was immediately in chaos.

    并社（九）
    屠鸿痕  改编·江荧画
    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    33　李百川召开了社员会，正在添油加醋的讲话，把二社的社员们都气坏了，这个说：“诬赖！咱干啥沾他们光，明天把苹果树给拔了去！”那个说：“赶早跟他们散伙！”莺花给一片嘈闹惊住了。
    34　莺花越听越急，忽见桂霞正贴着墙根搓手，奔过去问她，她说也是才来。往桌边灯影里看，她爹正和两个会计翻着账本，只有党员赵老金，叹气儿直跺脚转圈。
    35　莺花挤过去问赵老金，一眼被李百川看见了，马上叫莺花回家取文件，莺花只好应了一声，退没在黑影里，悄悄拉赵老金的后襟，叫他反对拔苹果树。
    36　赵老金的话没说完就被李百川打断了：“咱都得经过民主！老金，你究竟反对呢还是赞成群众的意见？”老金楞了。猛的传来一阵嘶叫：“着了火了！”会场顿时乱起来。
