    Let's Take Care of Ordinary Cadres!
    To the Editor:
    The heads of departments of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China each have a car to ride when they go out, but the Administrative Office of the Municipal Committee also issued them each a bicycle. As a result, some department heads have not ridden their bikes even once in more than two years; some department heads simply do not know how to ride a bike and have always entrusted the bikes to their messengers for safekeeping. However, some cadres of the Municipal Committee have no bicycles to ride when they go out on official business and have to walk. Why does the Administrative Office of the Xi'an Municipal Committee take care of the needs of leading comrades even when they don't need it, while neglecting the urgent needs of ordinary cadres?　Tan Jiang

### 照顾点一般干部吧！

    照顾点一般干部吧！编辑同志：
    中共西安市委的部长，每人外出都有汽车可乘坐，但是市委行政处却给他们每人发了一辆自行车，结果有的部长的车子两年多都没有骑用过一次；有的部长根本就不会骑车子，一直把车子交给通讯员保管。但是，市委有些干部因公外出却没有自行车可骑，只得步行。西安市委行政处为什么对领导同志不需要的却要照顾，而一般干部迫切需要的却不管呢？　谭江
