Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 23rd: Guangxi Province will carry out extensive industrial and agricultural construction in minority areas this year. The province's budgetary expenditure for minority areas this year will account for over 30% of the province's total budgetary expenditure (excluding direct allocations from the central government), an increase of 22% compared to 1955. This was decided at the fourth session of the First Guangxi Provincial People's Congress, which began on the 15th and closed on the 22nd.

    The budgetary allocations for minority areas in Guangxi Province in 1956 will be used for industrial construction such as power plants, water plants, gold mines, and phosphate mines in Wuming, Baise, Tianyang and other counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture where ethnic minorities live; the establishment of more than 260 agricultural technology extension stations, 16 animal husbandry and veterinary work stations, two state-owned farms, and three tractor stations in various ethnic areas; and the construction of 124 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, including the Hengli Reservoir in Binyang County and the Laohuling Reservoir in Yongning County. The irrigation area of these water conservancy projects will increase by 6.6 times compared to 1955, irrigating more than 3.8 million mu of farmland. In mountainous areas with traffic congestion, seven new and restored highways will be built from Baise to Boai, and from Bama to Fengshan, connecting many mountainous areas with counties outside. A special fund to promote the Zhuang language will be used for the newly built Guixi Zhuang Language School, the Zhuang Language Printing Factory, and the publication of Zhuang Language newspapers. The 19 newly built middle schools using this budget will increase the number of students of all ethnic groups by more than 15,000. 147 health clinics, five schistosomiasis prevention stations, and other medical institutions will further protect the health of ethnic minorities.

    In the Guangxi Province's local budget for 1956, which was adopted at the conference, in addition to the significant increase in funding for minority areas, the province's expenditure on agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and meteorological undertakings will increase by more than 131% compared to 1955.

    At the meeting, representatives of all ethnic groups actively and enthusiastically put forward sharp criticisms of certain errors and shortcomings in the government's work, and made suggestions for improvement. Representatives from minority areas and mountainous areas seriously criticized the government for the generalization of leadership in the work in these areas and the insufficient attention to improving the people's cultural and material lives in these areas.

    Wei Guoqing, Governor of Guangxi Province, analyzed some of the errors and shortcomings in various tasks at the meeting and put forward preliminary opinions on correction and improvement. He said that the shortcomings in leading rural sideline production and the work in ethnic minority areas have attracted special attention from the government and will be improved immediately.

    据新华社南宁23日电　广西省今年将在少数民族地区进行大量的工业和农业建设。这个省今年用于少数民族地区的预算支出，将占全省预算总支出的30％强（不包括中央直接拨款），比1955年增长22％，这是广西省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议通过的广西省1956年地方预算中决定的。这次会议在十五日开始，已经在二十二日闭幕。
    1956年广西省对少数民族地区的预算拨款，是用来在桂西僮族自治州少数民族聚居的武鸣、百色、田阳等县建立电厂、自来水厂、金矿、磷矿等工业建设；在各民族地区建立二百六十多个农业技术推广站、十六个畜牧兽医工作站、两个国营农场和三个拖拉机站等；另外修建124处大、中型水利，包括宾阳县横梨水库、邕宁县老虎岭水库等较大的水利工程。这些水利的灌溉面积将比1955年增长六点六倍，可灌三百八十多万亩田地。在交通阻塞的山区，新建与恢复百色到剥隘，巴马到凤山等七条公路，使许多山区的交通和外县贯通起来。一笔补助推行僮文的专款，将用在新建的桂西僮文学校、僮文印刷厂和出版僮文报方面。用这笔预算来新建的十九所中学校，将增加一万五千多名各民族的学生。147个卫生所、五个血吸虫病防治站等医疗机构，要进一步保障少数民族的健康。
    在这次大会上通过的广西省1956年的地方预算中，除了用于少数民族地区的经费有显著的增长以外，今年全省用于农林水利和气象事业的经费，要比1955年增长131％强。
    会上，各族人民代表积极热烈地对政府工作中某些错误和缺点提出了尖锐的批评，并且提出了改进的建议。来自少数民族地区和山区的代表，严肃地批评了政府在上述地区工作中存在着领导一般化和对这些地区人民文化、物质生活的改善不够重视等缺点。
    广西省省长韦国清在会上就各项工作中存在的一些错误和缺点作了分析，并且提出了纠正和改进的初步意见。他说：领导农村副业生产以及民族地区工作中的缺点等问题，已经引起政府特别重视，将立即着手改进。
