    From "Forced Sales" to "Forced Returns"
    By Our Correspondent Li Lianbin
    Party and government leading departments in Jiangxi Province are correcting the deviation of forcibly promoting double-wheeled, double-shared plows, in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions. However, many places have produced another deviation while correcting this one, which is to force agricultural cooperatives to return the double-wheeled, double-shared plows. Qingping Agricultural Cooperative in Shangqing Township, Fengcheng County, bought a double-wheeled, double-shared plow during the spring plowing season. Because of its high plowing efficiency, each team competed to use it, and they planned to buy one for each team this autumn. However, the working comrades not only did not cherish the peasants' enthusiasm for new farm tools but also forced them to return their only double-wheeled, double-shared plow to the supply and marketing cooperative. Two districts in Fengcheng County returned all the double-wheeled, double-shared plows purchased by the peasants.
    Why does correcting one deviation lead to another? In fact, these two deviations come from the same source: a lack of investigation and research, and concrete analysis. Forced returns are, in effect, a failure to learn from the lesson of forced sales; instead, the error is being repeated.
    The reason for the deviation of forced sales is that only the peasants' fondness for them and their suitability for promotion were seen, while the peasants' dislike for them and their unsuitability for promotion in certain areas were not. There are indeed some areas in Jiangxi Province where natural conditions limit the adoption of double-wheeled, double-shared plows. Forcing the sale of double-wheeled, double-shared plows in these areas inevitably turns them into "wall-hanging plows" or "warehouse plows," causing dissatisfaction among the peasants.
    The reason for the deviation of "forced returns" is that some working comrades only see the peasants' dislike for double-wheeled, double-shared plows and their unsuitability for promotion, while they do not see the peasants' fondness for them and their suitability for promotion in certain areas. According to the specific conditions of Jiangxi Province, most areas are suitable for promoting double-wheeled, double-shared plows. According to statistics from 14 counties in the Shangrao Special District, 439 townships are suitable for promotion, accounting for 50.5% of the total number of townships. 222 townships are partially suitable for promotion, accounting for 25.5% of the total number of townships. 207 townships are unsuitable for promotion, accounting for 24% of the total number of townships. This shows that 76% of the areas, i.e., most areas, can be promoted. If this situation is not seen, if the masses' love for double-wheeled, double-shared plows is not seen, forced returns will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the masses.
    We must adopt a positive attitude towards the promotion of double-wheeled, double-shared plows, and give the peasants specific guidance on technology. Because double-wheeled, double-shared plows are not only efficient but also an important step in realizing agricultural mechanization. As long as they are gradually promoted in accordance with local conditions, and the peasants recognize the benefits of double-wheeled, double-shared plows, they will warmly welcome them. Therefore, when correcting the deviation of forced sales, it is also necessary to proceed from the specific circumstances of each cooperative, conduct concrete analysis and research, and determine which ones should be returned and which ones should not be returned. Absolutely do not force returns across the board without distinction. We should summarize the experiences of those places where the promotion of double-wheeled, double-shared plows has been successful, publicize them widely, expand their influence, and create favorable conditions for further promotion of double-wheeled, double-shared plows.

### 从“强迫推销”到“强迫退货”

    从“强迫推销”到“强迫退货”
    本报记者　李连斌
    江西省各地党政领导部门正根据省委指示精神，纠正强迫推广双轮双铧犁的偏向。但是许多地方在纠正这一偏向的时候，又产生了另一偏向，就是强迫农业社退回双轮双铧犁。丰城县上清乡清平农业社春耕时购买一部双轮双铧犁，由于耕地效率高，各队争着用，并计划今秋要一队买一部。但工作同志不但不珍惜农民喜爱新农具的热情，反而把他们仅有的一部双轮双铧犁也强迫退回给供销社了。丰城县有两个区把农民购买的双轮双铧犁全部退掉了。
    为什么会纠正一个偏向又产生另一个偏向呢？其实这两个偏向是一个病源。就是缺乏调查研究和具体分析。强迫退货实际上是没有接受强迫推销的教训，而是重复了这个错误。
    所以产生强迫推销的偏向，是由于只看到农民喜爱的一面，适于推广的一面，而没有看到某些地区的农民不喜爱的一面，不适于推广的一面。江西省确实有一部分地区因自然条件的限制，不适宜采用双轮双铧犁。在这些地区强迫推销双轮双铧犁，就不能不变成“挂犁”“库犁”，造成农民的不满。
    所以产生“强迫退货”的偏向，是由于有些工作同志只看到农民不喜爱双轮双铧犁和不适于推广的一面，而没有看到某些地区的农民喜爱的适于推广的一面。根据江西省的具体情况看，大部分地区是适宜于推广双轮双铧犁的。据上饶专区十四个县的统计，有439个乡是适宜推广的，占总乡数的50.5％。有222个乡是部分适宜推广的，占总乡数的25.5％，不适宜推广的有207个乡，占总乡数的24％。这说明有76％的地区，即大部分地区可以推广。如果看不到这种情况，看不到群众对双轮双铧犁的热爱，强迫退货，也必然引起群众的不满。
    我们对双轮双铧犁的推广工作，必须采取积极的态度，在技术上给农民以具体指导。因为双轮双铧犁不但效率高，而且是实现农业机械化的一个重要步骤。只要因地制宜逐步推广，使农民认识到了双轮双铧犁的好处，他们是会热烈欢迎的。所以在纠正强迫推销的偏向的时候，也必须因地制宜，从各社的具体情况出发，具体进行分析研究，哪些应该退，哪些不应该退，绝不应该笼统地不加区别地一律强迫退货；对那些推广双轮双铧犁成功的地方，应总结经验，广泛宣传，扩大影响，为进一步推广双轮双铧犁创造有利的条件。
