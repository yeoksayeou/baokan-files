Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from London: London is paying close attention to the communiqué issued by Iraq on August 5th, which supported Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

    The British Foreign Office issued a statement on August 6th, completely omitting the section of the Iraqi communiqué that stated nationalization is the inalienable right of an independent nation. It only vaguely expressed agreement with Iraq's desire to resolve the canal issue. The statement also said that Britain "also supports Egypt's desire to realize its dignity, sovereignty, and independence."

    According to Western news agencies, the Iraqi communiqué greatly shocked the West, especially London. Reuters reported that London newspaper commentators believe that "Iraq's attitude is a major blow to British policy."

    The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" commentator, Forrest, said that Iraq's decision "may undermine the Baghdad Pact." The commentator expressed concern about the Arab world uniting around Egypt on the Suez Canal issue.

    Some newspapers, such as the Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" and "Daily Mail," expressed "disappointment" that Iraq supported Egypt on the canal issue. These newspapers had previously regarded Iraq as Britain's only ally in the Middle East. The "Daily Mail" said that Iraq, a member of the Baghdad Pact that had been "as firm as a rock," really "didn't need to stand so strongly on Nasser's side."

    伦敦报纸评论员承认
    伊拉克公报是对英国的重大打击
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦方面非常注意伊拉克在八月五日发表的支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的公报。
    英国外交部在八月六日发表了一个声明，它完全不提伊拉克的公报中谈到的国有化是独立国家确定不移的权利这一段话，而只是泛泛地表示赞成伊拉克要使运河问题得到解决的愿望。声明还说，英国“也支持埃及实现它的尊严、主权和独立的心愿”。
    据西方通讯社报道，伊拉克的公报使西方大为震动，尤其是使伦敦感到不安。路透社说，伦敦的报纸评论员认为，“伊拉克的态度是对英国政策的一个重大打击”。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”的评论员福莱斯特说，伊拉克的决定“可能破坏巴格达条约”。这个评论员对阿拉伯世界在苏彝士运河问题上团结在埃及周围这一点表示不安。
    保守党的“每日电讯报”和“每日邮报”等一些报纸对于伊拉克在运河问题上支持埃及表示“失望”，这些报纸过去一直把伊拉克看作是英国在中东的唯一的盟国。“每日邮报”说，伊拉克是“一直和岩石一样坚定”的巴格达条约成员国，它实在“不必这样强硬地站在纳赛尔的一边”。
