Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 5th. The Yumin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mafeng District, Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, has failed to earnestly implement the principle of "less deduction and more distribution." As a result, a large quantity of potatoes was concentrated in the cooperative, and due to poor storage, over 10,000 jin have recently rotted.

This year, the cooperative had a bumper potato harvest, with over 400,000 jin harvested from nearly twenty *qing* of land. According to the summer harvest pre-distribution plan, after setting aside 100,000 jin for seeds and 50,000 jin for grinding into flour, the rest would be distributed to the members. However, in the actual distribution, 70,000 jin of potatoes were reserved for grinding into flour, under-distributing 20,000 jin to the members. The cooperative's potato storage house was already small, and retaining an extra 20,000 jin made it even smaller. Furthermore, the cooperative director, Zhang Enqian, believed that the potatoes for grinding into flour could be of any quality, so he indiscriminately piled potatoes of all sizes, good or bad, bruised or broken, mixed with mud, into a small room, without ventilation or turning. Soon, the potatoes began to emit steam, develop an odor, and attract green flies. Su Guanglu, the deputy leader of the sideline production group, suggested timely disposal, but cooperative director Zhang Enqian said, "It doesn't matter, they can still be used for grinding into flour." The potatoes quickly began to leak water and emit a foul smell. As a result, over 10,000 jin of potatoes rotted, causing unnecessary losses to the members.

    裕民农业社“多扣少分”
    使土豆烂了一万多斤
    新华社沈阳5日电　辽宁省海城县马凤区裕民农业生产合作社，由于没有认真贯彻执行“少扣多分”的原则，把土豆集中社里很多，加上保管不善，最近已经烂了一万多斤。
    今年，这个社土豆丰收，近二十垧土地就收获了四十余万斤。按照夏收预分计划，除留下十万斤种子、五万斤磨粉用外，其余全部分给社员。但在实际分配时，磨粉用的土豆留了七万斤，少分给社员两万斤。社里保管土豆的房子本来就小，多留两万斤土豆就显得更小；加上社主任张恩谦认为磨粉用的土豆好坏都行，把土豆不分大小、好坏、镐伤、破皮，夹杂着泥土一股脑儿放在一间小屋里，既不通风，也不倒动。不久，土豆便冒气、变味、招惹绿蝇。副业组长宿广禄提议及时处理，社主任张恩谦却说：“不要紧、还可以磨粉用。”土豆很快就淌水了，臭气难闻。结果，土豆烂掉了一万多斤，使社员遭受了不应有的损失。
