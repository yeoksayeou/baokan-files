    Ignoring the Sign
    A couple, with their child, were strolling in Zhongshan Park. Suddenly, the child broke free from their mother's hand and ran to play on the lawn. The child's lively rolling around clearly attracted the father, who also lay down on the grass, admiring the loveliness of the green lawn while looking at the wooden sign that read: "Protect the lawn, please do not enter." Mao Yazhen

    The Bell Ringer
    A service worker at a certain workers' sanatorium is responsible for ringing the bell on time. Every day for three meals, as soon as they saw the convalescing workers heading towards the dining hall, they would start ringing the bell behind them, "ding-ding-dong-dong." They said: "Most of the comrades in convalescence have watches or pocket watches, and many people's timekeeping must be very accurate. I ring the bell following behind everyone's actions; this is the true mass line!"

    旁若无牌
    一对夫妇，带了小孩在中山公园散步，忽然孩子甩脱妈妈的手，跑到草地上去玩，孩子活泼的翻滚，显然是吸引了作爸爸的。一面也在草地上躺下，一面看着旁边的“爱护草地，请勿入内”的木牌，赞叹着这块绿油油的草地的可爱。毛亚震
    摇铃者
    某工人休养所担任按时摇铃的服务员，一日三餐，他只要看见休养员纷纷前往饭厅，便在后面叮叮噹噹地摇起铃来。他说：“休养员同志们大多数都有手表或挂表的，许多人的时计一定是很准确的，我跟在大家行动后面摇起铃来，这是真正的走群众路线啊！”
