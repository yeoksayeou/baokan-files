The principle that existence determines consciousness, and that consciousness, once generated, actively acts upon existence, is one of the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist philosophy that we are all familiar with. But it is not enough to understand only this far.

There is a view that the development of natural science is determined by the development of the natural world. Why? Because natural science is a reflection of the natural world; existence determines consciousness, and the development of the natural world determines the development of natural science. Of course, the development of the natural world will inevitably lead to the development of natural science, but in fact, since the emergence of science, especially in the recent few centuries, science has made rapid progress, while the changes in the natural world have been minimal. Obviously, the root of the development of natural science does not lie in the development of the natural world. The aforementioned view forgets the role of practice in the development of consciousness, and forgets that the development of natural science is determined by productive practice.

Dialectical materialism discovers that there is a decisive intermediate link between existence and consciousness; without it, consciousness and existence cannot be truly linked. This link is practice, the activity of the people in transforming the world. There is a complex dialectical relationship between practice and cognition.

Not only does existence precede cognition, but practice also precedes cognition. "People have already acted before they begin to reason. 'Action comes first'." (Engels) Agricultural production precedes agricultural science; the workers' movement precedes Marxism; the Chinese people's revolutionary movement precedes the scientific theory of the Chinese revolution.

Why does practice precede cognition? Because cognition is not only a product of existence, but also a product of practice; practice is the foundation of cognition: productive practice is the foundation of natural science, and revolutionary practice is the foundation of social science.

To say that practice is the foundation of cognition means:

First, practice is the starting point of cognition; cognition is for the purpose of satisfying the needs of practice. The emergence of astronomy was to satisfy the needs of nomadic life, agriculture, and navigation; the emergence of mechanics was to satisfy the needs of large urban buildings and the development of handicrafts; and the development of astronomy and mechanics in turn promoted the development of mathematics. "Thus, the origin and development of science are determined by production from the very beginning." (Engels) The continued development of science, the continuous raising and solving of new problems in science, is also determined by practice. Some problems in science may not be directly caused by practice, and some knowledge may not have a direct connection with practice, but as long as they are needed for the development of the entire science, they are also indirectly to satisfy the needs of practice.

Second, only practice can provide cognition with sufficient and reliable materials. Here we must especially emphasize that what we call cognition is mainly scientific cognition, that is, rational cognition or the understanding of the laws of things; what we call practice should of course include the personal practice of the cognizer, but mainly the practical activities of the masses. (For natural science, practice includes not only production, but also experimentation; experimentation includes personal experiments, but mainly the experiments of scientists.) Only by throwing oneself into the practical activities of the masses, only by relying on the materials provided by the practical activities of the masses, can we obtain an understanding of the laws of things, because only these materials are rich and mostly reliable.

Third, practice is the only criterion for testing the truth of cognition and the source for the continued development of cognition. Whether our cognition is consistent with objective laws can only be checked through practice. According to the test of practice, if the cognition is wrong, it should be corrected; if it is wrong to what extent, it should be corrected to what extent; if it is completely wrong, it should be restarted; if it is right, we should make our cognition more specific, more precise, and more profound in practice.

Let us take last year's upsurge of cooperativization as an example to illustrate these last two points:

Last July, in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Chairman Mao said, "A new high tide of the socialist mass movement is about to arrive in the rural areas of the whole country." Later, the high tide did indeed arrive. Some people say that if the leadership says there is a high tide, then there is a high tide. Why do these people think that the high tide was completely called out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao? Because before Chairman Mao's report, they did not see the high tide, but only saw the "low tide," and after the report, the high tide appeared. Does this not show that the high tide was called out? Yes, the call played a huge role in promoting the emergence of the high tide, which will be discussed later. However, the high tide was not created out of thin air by calling it; its emergence had its roots, which are the increase in the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants and the accumulation of the Party's experience in leading cooperativization. When the mass conditions and the leadership conditions were both met, the high tide had already arrived in some areas before Chairman Mao's report. These were the essence and mainstream of our country's rural areas at that time. Chairman Mao saw this, and not only Chairman Mao saw it, but also many comrades in their respective areas saw it. For example, the report of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in August 1954, which Chairman Mao mentioned in his report, talked about "the formation and development of the high tide of rural cooperation." Why could some comrades see it while others could not? One of the roots lies in whether the cognition is based on the practice of the masses.

It cannot be said that these comrades had no practice at all, which is not much for comrades who are doing practical work, but it is also difficult to say that they completely threw themselves into the practice of the masses. In fact, they did not listen to the voice of mass practice, did not pay attention to the needs of the broad masses, did not comprehensively investigate the trend of practice, but were confused by one-sided practical experience, and intimidated by the cries of rich peasants and middle peasants with spontaneous capitalist tendencies. Therefore, they could not correctly realize the leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and regarded the non-essential and non-mainstream things as essential and mainstream.

The reason why Chairman Mao was able to grasp the essence and mainstream of rural development was that he studied a large number of factual materials and made comprehensive on-the-spot investigations. His prediction that the high tide was about to arrive was based on the foundation of mass practice. The arrival of the high tide proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's prediction, and at the same time made our understanding of the road of agricultural development in our country more precise and profound. The "National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" contains this more precise and profound understanding, and this outline was put forward on the basis of the practice of the high tide of cooperativization, and is a further development, deepening, and concretization of the thoughts in Chairman Mao's article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Party's policy of agricultural cooperation.

In the example of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in our country, the principle that practice is the foundation of cognition can be fully explained.

It must be stated that in discussing the dependence of cognition on practice, we have simplified the problem to a certain extent for the convenience of narration. For example, when we say that practice comes first and then cognition, it seems that there is no cognition in this prior practice. Since mankind has a more or less regular understanding of the objective world, this is of course impossible. Human practice, as long as it is human practice, always contains some cognition; human cognition does not start from an empty ground, but always takes the knowledge accumulated in human history as its footing. However, past knowledge was obtained on the basis of past practice; it either does not apply to new practice at all, or can only provide general guidance to new practice. In order to specifically guide new practice, we need completely new cognition, or more specific cognition. And this can only be obtained on the basis of new practice. The Soviet Union's experience in agricultural collectivization is undoubtedly very important and necessary for our agricultural cooperativization, but it is not enough, because it can only provide general guidance for the development of agriculture in our country, but cannot provide specific guidance. Only the knowledge of the laws obtained in the practice of cooperation in our country can specifically guide the cooperative movement in our country. Furthermore, past cognition was also generated on the basis of practice, and not out of thin air. Therefore, we believe that the inheritance and relative independence of human knowledge and the proposition that practice is the foundation of cognition are not contradictory. The mistake of dogmatists lies in replacing specific cognition with general cognition, replacing cognition that conforms to that situation with cognition for this situation, and forgetting practice, especially forgetting the current practice of the masses.

The role of practice on cognition is only one aspect of the problem; the other aspect of the problem, that is, the role of cognition on practice, must also be clarified.

Under the guidance of regular cognition, people's practical activities, activities to transform nature and transform society, will rapidly move forward. This is conscious practice. Conscious practice can ensure that the expected results are achieved faster, better, and with less loss, while spontaneous practice cannot but suffer some setbacks and significant losses.

Generally speaking, the Chinese cooperativization movement was carried out under the conscious leadership of the Party, and we also created the specific form of agricultural cooperativization in China. However, in the first half of 1955, our comrades in general were not clear about whether there would be a high tide in the cooperativization movement, when the high tide would arrive, and when the cooperativization movement could be basically completed, etc. In these aspects, our cooperativization movement still had a certain degree of spontaneity. In this state, many comrades could not help but waver and panic in the face of the rising socialist enthusiasm of the peasants, and some comrades even got dizzy and took wrong measures. But when we recognized the essence and mainstream of rural development, the situation changed dramatically. Our vast number of cadres led the rural areas to advance towards socialism with firm steps, forming a nationwide high tide of cooperativization. The great role of regular cognition and consciousness is demonstrated here more clearly than ever.

Of course, sometimes we have to grope forward in a spontaneous state, and spontaneous practice is often necessary. Generally speaking, without spontaneous practice, there would be no regular cognition, and therefore no conscious practice. We can and should first master the general laws and then practice, which is to learn the scientific achievements of mankind before practice, but we cannot wait until we have mastered the laws of the specific work object before we practice, but we can only grasp these laws in practice. Only in the water can we master the laws of swimming. Therefore, spontaneous practice is not necessarily a bad thing. However, we must never stay in spontaneous practice for a long time, we must grasp the laws of the development of things from practice, and use them to guide practice.

Therefore, when emphasizing the decisive role of practice on cognition, we must never forget the great role of cognition. Cognition that is divorced from practice cannot become truly scientific cognition, and practice that is divorced from cognition is also difficult to achieve the purpose of practice. It should also be pointed out that with the development of human history, the role of cognition is becoming more and more significant, the spontaneity of human practice is becoming less and less, and the consciousness is becoming higher and higher. As everyone knows, modern industry cannot do without modern science for a day, and the revolutionary movement of the working class cannot do without Marxism and a scientific understanding of specific conditions for a day. The establishment of socialism and communism from its inception is the result of conscious activity. One of the mistakes of empiricism is to linger in spontaneous practice, and therefore it cannot resist the confusion of certain illusions or individual phenomena, and even make mistakes.

This is the dialectical relationship between cognition and practice. This dialectical relationship can be expressed as follows: Practice is the foundation of cognition, and is the main aspect of this contradiction, but the scientific cognition obtained on the basis of practice is, under certain conditions, the main force that promotes the advancement of practice. As Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": In the contradictory relationship between theory and practice, practice is the main one, that is, it generally manifests itself as the main determining role. However, under certain conditions, theory turns around and manifests itself as the main determining role. "When, as Lenin said, 'there will be no revolutionary movement without revolutionary theory,' the creation and advocacy of revolutionary theory plays the main determining role. When something (everything is the same) is to be done, but there is no direction, method, plan, or policy, determining the direction, method, plan, or policy is the main determining thing." This relationship can also be expressed by a formula, which is: practice - cognition - practice. The second practice is not a simple repetition of the first practice. Because it is carried out under the guidance of scientific cognition or the guidelines and policies formulated on the basis of this cognition, it is a higher-level practice. Because practice is mainly the practice of the masses and not just the narrow practice of one person and one place, this relationship is also the mass line repeatedly proposed in various documents of the Party, that is, from the masses (from practice to cognition), to the masses (from cognition to practice), concentrate it, and persist in it.

This is how Marxism explains the relationship between cognition and practice.

    认识和实践的辩证关系
    黄枬森
    存在决定意识，意识一旦产生，又积极作用于存在，这是我们所熟知的马克思列宁主义哲学的基本原理之一。但仅仅了解到这一步是不够的。
    有这样一种观点，似乎自然科学的发展是自然界的发展决定的。为什么呢？因为自然科学是自然界的反映，存在决定意识，自然界的发展决定自然科学的发展。当然，自然界发展了必然会引起自然科学的发展，但是事实上人类自有科学以来，几千年中，特别是在最近几百年中，科学有了突飞猛进的发展，而自然界的变化则是微乎其微的。显然，自然科学发展的根源并不在于自然界的发展。前述的观点忘记了实践在意识发展中的作用，忘记了自然科学的发展是由生产实践所决定的。
    辩证唯物主义发现，在存在和意识之间有一个决定性的中间环节，离开它，意识和存在是不能真正联系起来的。这个环节就是实践，就是人民群众的改造世界的活动。实践和认识之间存在着复杂的辩证关系。
    不仅仅存在先于认识，实践也先于认识。“人们在开始论证以前，他们是已经行动了的。‘事业在先’。”（恩格斯）农业生产先于农业科学；工人运动先于马克思主义；中国人民的革命运动先于中国革命的科学理论。
    为什么实践会先于认识？因为认识不仅是存在的产物，也是实践的产物；实践是认识的基础：生产实践是自然科学的基础，革命实践是社会科学的基础。
    说实践是认识的基础，这就是说：
    第一，实践是认识的出发点，认识是为了满足实践的需要。天文学的产生是为了满足游牧、农业、航海的需要，力学的产生是为了满足城市大建筑物和手工业发展的需要，而天文学和力学的发展又推动了数学的发展。“这样，科学的发生和发展从开始起便是由生产所决定的。”（恩格斯）科学的继续发展，科学中新问题的不断提出和解决，也是实践所决定的。科学中的某些问题可能不是由实践直接引起的，某些知识可能和实践没有直接的联系，但只要它们是为整个科学发展所需要的，它们也是间接地为了满足实践的需要。
    第二，只有实践能够给认识提供充足的可靠的材料。这里我们要特别强调一下，我们所谓认识主要的是科学的认识，即理性认识或对事物的规律性的认识；所谓实践当然应该包括认识者个人的亲身实践，但主要的是人民群众的实践活动。（对于自然科学来说，实践不仅是生产，还包括实验；实验包括个人的实验，但主要的是科学家们的实验。）只有投身到人民群众的实践活动中，只有依靠人民群众的实践活动所提供的材料，我们才能获得对事物的规律性的认识，因为只有这些材料才是丰富的、大部分可靠的。
    第三，实践是检验认识的真理性的唯一标准，是认识得以继续发展的源泉。我们的认识是否与客观规律一致，只有通过实践才能检查得出来。根据实践的检验，如果认识错了，就改正；错多少，改正多少，全盘错了，重新来过；如果对了，我们就在实践中来使我们的认识更加具体，更加精密，更加深刻。
    不妨以去年掀起的合作化高潮来说明这最后两点：
    去年七月毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中说，“在全国农村中，新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来。”后来高潮果然到来了。有些人说，领导上说有高潮就有高潮。为什么这些人会认为高潮完全是党中央和毛主席号召出来的呢？因为在毛主席报告之前，他们没有看见高潮，而只看见“低潮”，而报告之后就出现了高潮，难道这不是说明高潮是号召出来的吗？是的，号召对于高潮的出现起了巨大的推动作用，这点以后还要谈到。但是，高潮并不是用号召凭空制造出来的，它的出现有其根源，这就是广大农民群众社会主义觉悟的提高和党的领导合作化经验的积累。群众条件和领导条件都具备了，在毛主席报告之前，高潮在某些地区也已经到来了。这些就是当时我国农村的本质和主流。这个，毛主席看出来了，不仅毛主席看出来，还有不少同志在他所在的地区内也看出来了，譬如毛主席在他的报告中所提到的中国共产党黑龙江省委1954年8月的报告中就谈到“农村合作化高涨形势的形成和发展”。为什么有些同志看得见而有些同志看不见呢？其根源之一就在于认识是不是建立在人民群众的实践的基础之上。
    还不能说这些同志完全没有实践，这对于作实际工作的同志来说是不多的，然而也很难说他们是完全投身到了群众的实践中去。事实上他们并没有倾听群众实践的声音，并没有注意到广大人民群众的需要，并没有全面考察实践的趋向，而是迷惑于片面的实践经验，震慑于富农和具有资本主义自发倾向的中农的叫嚷，因而他们不能正确地实现从感性认识到理性认识的飞跃，把非本质、非主流的东西看成了本质、主流。
    毛主席之所以能够把握农村发展的本质、主流，是由于他研究了大量的事实材料，作了全面的实地考察，他所作的高潮即将到来的预见正是建立在这种群众实践的基础上的。高潮的到来证明了毛主席预见的正确，同时也使我们对我国农业发展的道路的认识更加精密、更加深刻。“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”中包含了这种更精密、深刻的认识，而这个纲要就是在合作化高潮的实践基础上提出来的，是毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”一文中的思想和党的农业合作化政策的进一步发展、深刻化、具体化。
    在我国农业合作化高潮这个例子中，实践是认识的基础的原理可以得到充分的说明。
    必须申明：我们在论述认识对实践的依赖时，为了叙述的方便，是在一定程度上把问题简单化了的。譬如说，我们说先有实践，后有认识，仿佛这个在先的实践中就没有任何认识似的。自从人类对客观世界有了或多或少的规律性认识之后，这当然是不可能的。人的实践，只要是人的实践，总多少包含一些认识；人的认识并不是从空地上开始的，总是以人类历史上积累起来的知识为立足点的。但是过去的知识是在过去的实践基础上获得的，它或者根本不适用于新的实践，或者只能对新的实践作一般性的指导，为了具体指导新的实践，我们就需要全新的认识，或者更加具体的认识。而这只有在新的实践的基础上才能获得。苏联关于农业集体化的经验，毫无疑问，对我们农业的合作化是非常重要的、必要的，但是不够的，因为它对我国农业发展只能提供一般的指导，而不能提供具体的指导。只有在我国合作化实践中获得的规律性知识，才能具体指导我国的合作化运动。再说，过去的认识也是在实践基础上产生的，而并非凭空产生的。因此，我们认为人类知识的继承性、相对独立性和实践是认识的基础的论断并不矛盾。教条主义者的错误就在于以一般性的认识来代替具体的认识，以符合于彼一情况的认识来代替对于此一情况的认识，忘记了实践，特别是忘记了当前的人民群众的实践。
    实践对于认识的作用，仅是问题的一方面，还必须阐明问题的另一方面，即认识对实践的作用。
    在规律性的认识的指导下，人们的实践活动，改造自然和改造社会的活动就会迅速向前推进。这就是自觉的实践。自觉的实践能够保证更快地更好地更少损失地达到预期的效果，而自发的实践则不能不受到一些挫折和重大的损失。
    整个说来，中国合作化运动是在党的自觉领导之下进行的，我们也创造出了中国农业合作化的具体形式。但是，在1955年上半年我们一般同志对于合作化运动会不会有高潮，高潮何时到来，合作化运动何时可以基本结束等等都是不明确的，就这些方面来说，我们的合作化运动仍然存在着一定程度的自发性。在这种状态中，许多同志在农民高涨的社会主义积极性面前就不免动摇不定，惊惶失措，而有些同志甚至吓昏了头脑，采取了错误措施。但当我们认清了农村发展的本质、主流之后，情况就顿然改观。我们的广大干部用坚定的步伐大踏步地领导着农村向社会主义前进，形成了全国性的合作化高潮。对规律性认识和自觉性的巨大作用，在这里表现得再清楚不过了。
    当然，有些时候，我们不得不在自发状态中摸索前进，自发的实践常常是必要的。一般说来，没有自发的实践就不会有规律性认识，因而也就不会有自觉的实践。我们可以而且应该先掌握了一般的规律再去实践，这就是在实践之前对于人类科学成就的学习，但不能等掌握了具体工作对象的规律之后再去实践，而只能在实践中去掌握这些规律。只有在水里面才能掌握游泳的规律。因此，自发的实践不一定是坏事情。但是，决不能老停留在自发的实践中，必须从实践中去掌握事物发展的规律，并以它来指导实践。
    因此，在强调实践对于认识的决定性作用的时候，决不可忘记认识的巨大作用。脱离实践的认识不可能成为真正科学的认识，而脱离认识的实践也很难达到实践的目的。还应该指出，随着人类历史的发展，认识的作用也愈来愈巨大，人类实践的自发性也愈来愈少，自觉性也愈来愈高。大家知道，现代工业一天也离不开现代科学，工人阶级的革命运动一天也离不开马克思主义和对具体条件的科学认识。社会主义和共产主义从萌芽到建立都是自觉活动的结果。经验主义的错误之一就是徘徊在自发的实践之中，因而就不能抵抗某些假象或个别现象的迷惑，以至犯下错误。
    这就是认识和实践之间的辩证关系，这个辩证关系可以表述如下：实践是认识的基础，是这个矛盾双方的主要方面，但以实践为基础所获得的科学认识在一定条件下又是推动实践前进的主要的力量。正如毛主席在“矛盾论”中所说的：在理论和实践这一个矛盾关系中，实践是主要的，即一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，然而，在一定条件下，理论又转过来表现为主要的决定的作用。“当着如同列宁所说‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动’的时候，革命理论的创立和提倡就起了主要的决定的作用。当着某一件事情（任何事情都是一样）要做，但是还没有方针方法计划或政策的时候，确定方针、方法、计划或政策，也就是主要的决定的东西。”这个关系也可用一个公式来表述，这就是：实践——认识——实践。第二个实践并不是第一个实践的简单重复，由于它是在科学认识或根据这种认识制定出来的方针、政策的指导之下进行的，因而就是更高级的实践了。由于实践主要是人民群众的实践而不仅是一人一地的狭隘的实践，这个关系也就是党的各种文件所一再提出的群众路线，即从群众中来（从实践到认识）、到群众中去（从认识到实践），集中起来、坚持下去的路线。
    马克思主义就是这样来说明认识和实践的关系的。
