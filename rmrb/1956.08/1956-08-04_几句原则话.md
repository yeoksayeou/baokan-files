    "A Few Words of Principle"
    Si Tu Gui
    In a teahouse near the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, four university students were reviewing their lessons. They were discussing a problem that none of them were quite sure about, but they didn't delve into it deeply. One of them, as if he had obtained a completely correct answer, said: "Let it go. When the teacher asks, we'll just say a few words of principle."
    This sentence made me ponder for a long time.
    Principles are supposed to be the truth, but now they have been turned into a means of coping with exams. Just saying "a few words of principle" can get you through. If Sun Wukong were alive today, he might use this method to escape Tang Monk's "tightening fillet."
    After careful thought, "a few words of principle" has not only become a means for some students to cope with exams, but has also become a new way of "dealing with the world" and "handling affairs" for some people. We often encounter such people. No matter the size of the matter, no matter the time or occasion, they always play "a few words of principle" like a gramophone, making people feel very uncomfortable and causing aversion. What is opposed, of course, is not the truth or principles, but the fact that he does not truly understand or believe in the words he flaunts, but is just saying them. Turning aversion into deeper investigation, we can faintly see the hypocritical things hidden behind it that completely violate principles. Isn't it so? Lazy thinkers beg for it to work; mediocre people rely on it to get by; conservatives use it to block the progress of new things; subjectivists and dogmatists wield the axe of principles to kill and chop indiscriminately; new "wise men" use it to replace "not speaking ill of others" to "protect themselves"; sycophants and flatterers rely on it to deceive superiors and oppress subordinates; double-dealing hypocrites use it as a matchmaker to find lovers. "Principles" are truly omnipotent.
    Thus, "a few words of principle" has become a fog covering some corners of the new life, making people "unable to see the true face of Mount Lu." All ghosts of backward forces and backward ideas have obtained a gaudy coat here, enabling them to be temporarily preserved and even corrupting the pure hearts of newcomers.
    Wise people need to have X-ray-like eyes.
    "Clever words, though beautiful, will surely perish when used." Once uncovered, they will be exposed in their true form.

### “几句原则话”

    “几句原则话”
    司徒癸
    在颐和园长廊附近的茶社里，有四位大学生复习功课。他们讨论到一个问题，谁都不十分有把握，可是，并没有深究下去。其中有一位好像获得了完全正确的答案似地说：“算了吧，等老师问的时候，只说几句原则话就行了。”
    这句话使我沉思好久。
    原则话本来是真理，现在竟然被弄成应付考试的手段，只说“几句原则话”就能应付过去。如果孙悟空生在今天，也许会以此法免除唐僧的“紧箍咒”之厄的。
    仔细想了一下，“几句原则话”不仅成为某些学生应付考试的手段，而且已经变成一些人新的“处世”和“处事”之道。常常会碰到这样的人，不管大事小事，也不管在什么时间和什么场合之下他总要像留声机一样唱“几句原则话”，让人听着很不舒服，起反感。所反的当然不是真理和原则话，而是他对于他所炫耀的话并不真懂，或者并不真信，只是说说而已。化反感为深究，就会隐隐看到、背后藏着完全违犯原则的虚伪的东西。不是么？思想懒汉乞灵于它去工作；庸庸碌碌的人靠它混日子；保守主义者用它阻挡新事物的前进；主观主义者和教条主义者抡起原则话的斧子乱杀乱砍；新的“明哲”们用它代替“口不言臧否”以“保身”；拍马吹牛、阿谀奉迎的势利小人靠它欺上压下；口是心非的伪君子用它当媒婆找爱人。“原则话”真是万能了。
    于是，“几句原则话”成了罩在新生活的一些角落里的迷雾，使人“不见庐山真面目”。一切落后势力、落后思想的幽灵，在这里取得了一件五光十色的外衣，得以暂时保存下来，还腐蚀着新生者纯洁的心。
    聪明人，需要有一对爱克斯光样的眼睛。
    “巧言虽美，用之必灭”，揭开一看，就要原形毕露了。
