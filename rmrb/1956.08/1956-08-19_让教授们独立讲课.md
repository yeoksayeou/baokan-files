Let Professors Lecture Independently
Wu Dakun

After reading Mr. Ma Yinchu's article "I Also Want to Talk About the Hundred Schools of Thought" in the People's Daily on July 11, I couldn't help but feel a lot of emotions. In that article, Mr. Ma Yinchu cited two prominent examples to illustrate the harm caused by some professors adopting the method of "reading manuscripts" in class, especially the harm to "crippling students' independent thinking ability." I completely agree. However, it is a pity that Mr. Ma Yinchu did not further point out the reasons why these professors currently have to, or dare to, adopt the method of "reading manuscripts" in class in his article. I think this is really unfair to some professors.

In fact, the current situation in universities is that, as far as I know, not only students lack the cultivation of "independent thinking" ability, but also university professors can only "parrot" or "memorize manuscripts" to varying degrees and in different forms. Under such circumstances, it is obviously impossible for the academic community to truly form a high tide of "a hundred schools of thought contending." Therefore, I believe that to truly implement the policy of "a hundred schools of thought contending," professors in universities should first have the ability to lecture independently. If professors do not even have the ability to lecture independently, then it is impossible to form any academic atmosphere of "a hundred schools of thought contending" in universities.

So, what power is currently hindering the "independent lecturing" of professors in universities? I think it is the many unwritten rules and regulations that have become popular in universities since liberation, restricting professors' independent lecturing!

Originally, since liberation, the evaluation of a professor's lecturing quality by party and government responsible personnel in many universities has long been based not on his "creativity" and his independent research ability in academic work, but on his "discipline." The so-called "discipline" means requiring professors to only lecture in class completely according to the syllabus or lecture notes that have been approved in advance by certain "leaders" or other personnel, and not to lecture according to unapproved lecture notes. If a certain teacher does not follow the syllabus in class, then it is a very "serious" matter. He may be subject to some criticisms, such as saying that he has the mistakes of "liberalism" and "speaking off the cuff" in his lectures, and so on.

The two busiest things for us professors now are "attending meetings" and "preparing to write lecture notes," and in the process of writing lecture notes, the most time is spent on "finding evidence." That is to say, every sentence and every content that is said must be based on "evidence." Of course, this "evidence" is best if it is something that Marx, Lenin, or other party and government leaders have said, and so on. In this way, some young teachers who went to Renmin University of China or the Marxist-Leninist Academy after liberation have an advantage, even though they have less experience, because they already have "evidence." They have the lecture notes, notes, and other things they learned when they were studying at school. If someone doubts the correctness of their lectures, they can confidently answer, "Our notebook from Renmin University of China says so!" The person who raised the objection will definitely be immediately "speechless" after hearing this. However, of course, under such circumstances, these young teachers who graduated from Renmin University of China or the Marxist-Leninist Academy would never dare to leave their "lecture notes" and lecture independently!

Since everyone is advocating memorizing lecture notes (memorizing lecture notes to varying degrees and in different forms), and taking being able to lecture "correctly" (actually requiring uniformity) as the primary meaning, who can still "lecture independently"?

In this case, many strange phenomena have arisen. For example, take the history department of our Shandong University. Because the person in charge believes in the "Western Zhou feudalism theory," there has been an unwritten "rule" in the history department in the past few years, that is, regardless of whether the professors truly believe in the "Western Zhou feudalism theory," they must explain to the students in class that they are "Western Zhou feudalism theorists" and talk about history according to the saying that "Western Zhou was a feudal society." It is said that only in this way can students' thinking be prevented from becoming "confused"! However, I don't know whether students' thinking can really be prevented from becoming "confused" in this way, but for some professors who do not believe in the "Western Zhou feudalism theory," it has really created "confusion," at least creating "personality split" for them (that is, they must say one thing in class, as a "Western Zhou feudalism theorist," and after class, when publishing their own works, say another thing, opposing the "Western Zhou feudalism theory" that they said in class).

I believe that if this kind of unwritten rule that hinders university professors from lecturing independently cannot be completely abolished in the current universities, then the phenomenon of professors "reciting manuscripts" pointed out by Mr. Ma Yinchu cannot be avoided. Because "parrot-fashion teaching" is "dogmatism" and should be criticized, but compared with being criticized for "speaking off the cuff" and "liberalism" when lecturing independently, it is still lighter after all. Therefore, now, as far as I know, some professors already have "dogmatism," which is unavoidable. And the idea that it is better to "parrot" than to "speak off the cuff" is becoming popular. If everyone only "recites books" and "recites books" based on "authoritative" works, although it may sound boring to students, and even "cripple students' independent thinking ability" as Mr. Ma Yinchu pointed out, it can be certain that there will be no "trouble" in the content of the lectures, and the school leaders can be more at ease. If, in the future, university professors all "lecture independently," the leaders must be able to truly lead and measure the quality of professors from an academic perspective, and not lead and measure the quality of professors according to their own old "unified" standards, which will add a lot of trouble to the current responsible personnel of the school, which is probably also certain.

In order to truly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee for "a hundred schools of thought contending," do the leading comrades of our current Ministry of Higher Education and the comrades who are currently responsible for leading work in universities across the country have the determination to thoroughly change their thinking style?

### 让教授们独立讲课

    让教授们独立讲课
    吴大琨
    读完七月十一日人民日报上马寅初先生写的那篇“我也来谈谈百家争鸣”的文章以后，不禁引起了我很多的感慨。马寅初先生在那篇文章中，举了两个突出的例子来说明目前有些教授们在上课的时候，由于采取了“念讲稿”的方式带来的危害性，特别是对于“残害了学生的独立思考机能”的危害性。我完全表示同感。但是，可惜马寅初先生在他的那篇文章中并没有进一步指出造成这些教授们目前不能不、或者不敢不在上课的时候采取“念讲稿”的原因来。我认为这对某些教授来说，实在也是很冤枉的。
    其实，目前大学里的情况是，就我所知，不但学生缺乏取得“独立思考”能力的培养，就是大学教授们也只能在各种不同的程度和形式上“照本宣科”或者“死背讲稿”。在这样的情形下，要学术界真正形成“百家争鸣”的高潮，显然是不可能的。所以我认为要真正贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，首先在大学里的教授们就应该有独立讲课的能力，如果教授们连独立讲课的能力都没有，那就决不可能在大学里形成什么“百家争鸣”的学术空气的。
    那么，目前大学里，究竟是什么力量在阻碍着教授们的“独立讲课”呢？我认为：那就是解放以后，在大学校里所无形中流行起来的许多限制教授们独立讲课的清规戒律！
    原来，自从解放以后，许多大学里的党政负责人员对于一个教授讲课的优劣的评价，已经久已不是他的“创造性”，他在学术工作上的独立钻研能力，而是他的“纪律性”了。所谓“纪律性”，就是要求教授们上课的时候能够完全只依照事先为某些“领导”人员或者其他人员所批准的大纲或者讲稿讲，而不准依照没有批准的讲义讲。如果某一教员，在上课的时候，不照大纲讲，那就是很“严重”的一件事情了。他就可以受到一些批评，如说他讲课时有“自由主义”、“信口开河”的错误等等。
    我们目前做教授的，最忙的，就是“开会”和“准备写讲稿”两件事，而在写讲稿的过程中，花时间最多的又是“找根据”。即所讲的每一句话，每一个内容，都必须要找到“根据”。这种“根据”，当然最好是马克思、列宁所说过的话，或者是其他什么党政首长们所说过的话，等等。这样一来，有些年轻的、解放以后才去中国人民大学或者是马克思列宁学院学习回来了的教员，他们学历虽浅，可是却占了便宜。因为他们就都早有了“根据”。他们有他们在学校里学习的时候所学到的那一本讲义、笔记之类的东西。如果有人对他们的讲课的正确性发生怀疑的时候，他们就可以很理直气壮地回答说：“我们中国人民大学的笔记本上是这样讲的！”对方提意见的人一听，也就一定会立刻“哑口无言”了。不过，当然在这样的情形下，这些在中国人民大学或者马克思列宁学院毕业回来了的年轻教员也决不敢在讲课的时候离开了他的“讲稿”而独立的！
    既然大家都在提倡背讲稿（在各种不同程度形式上的背讲稿），以能够讲得“正确”（实际上是要求千篇一律）为第一义，试问谁还能够“独立讲课”呢？
    在这种情况下，就产生了许多奇怪现象。例如，拿我们山东大学的历史系来说，由于主持的人是相信“西周封建论”的，因此在过去几年，历史系里就有这么一条不成文的“戒律”，即不管教授们是否真相信“西周封建论”，但在上课的时候，就必须对学生说明是“西周封建论者”，按照“西周是封建社会”的说法来讲历史。据说只有这样，才能避免不使学生的思想发生“混乱”！可是这样一来，学生们的思想，是否真的可以避免了“混乱”，我虽不得而知，对于有些不相信“西周封建论”的教授们来说，却就真的制造了“混乱”。至少是制造了他的“人格分裂”（即他必须在上课时讲一套，作为“西周封建论者”，在下课以后发表他自己的著作时，另讲一套，反对他自己上课时所说的“西周封建论”的那一套）。
    我认为，这一类的妨碍大学教授们独立讲课的清规戒律，如果不能在目前的大学里彻底废除，那么马寅初先生所指出的那种教授“背讲稿”的现象就决不能避免。因为“照本宣科”虽然是“教条主义”，要受到批评，可是比起独立讲课的时候，要受到“信口开河”“自由主义”等等的批评来，毕竟还是轻的。所以现在，就我所知，就已经有一些教授们有“教条主义”，那是不可避免的。而且与其“信口开河”不如“照本宣科”的主张流行起来。如果大家都只“背书”，根据“权威”著作“背书”，虽然学生们听起来枯燥一些，甚至要像马寅初先生所指出的那样“残害了学生的独立思考机能”，但是可以在讲课内容上不出“乱子”，学校的领导人员可以比较放心一些，这一点也是可以肯定的。如果，今后的大学教授们都要“独立讲课”起来，领导人员就要能真正从学术的角度上去领导去衡量教授们的优劣，不能根据他自己的老一套的“统一”标准去领导去衡量教授们的优劣，这要给目前学校的负责人员增添很多麻烦，这一点，恐怕也是肯定的。
    为了真正能做到响应党中央“百家争鸣”的号召，我们今天的高等教育部的领导同志，以及目前在全国各大学负责领导工作的同志们的思想作风，有没有彻底改变一下的决心呢？
