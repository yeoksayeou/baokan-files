Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 31st: The Guangzhou Municipal Company of the China Vegetable Company recently signed vegetable purchase and sale contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburban districts of the city. The contracts include the variety, yield, price, and delivery date of vegetables. After signing the contracts, members of the agricultural cooperatives no longer need to worry about the sales of vegetables and the threat of losses. The vegetable company also feels confident and has taken the initiative in its operations.

Before signing the contracts, the vegetable company sent staff to the agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to investigate vegetable production and costs, listen to their opinions, and conduct joint research with the city-level commercial and other relevant leading departments. Then, based on the principle of determining production based on sales, they signed the July purchase and sale contracts with the agricultural cooperatives. After signing the contracts, the vegetable company also regularly sent staff to establish contact with each agricultural cooperative to understand their production situation.

The suburbs of Guangzhou have a warm climate, fertile land, and convenient irrigation conditions, allowing vegetables to be grown all year round. At the same time, local farmers have a habit of producing vegetables year-round. After the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization in the suburbs at the beginning of this year, farmers became even more active in vegetable production. Due to the vegetable company's underestimation of these situations and lack of contact with relevant departments, coupled with the seasonal imbalance of vegetable production, there were frequent imbalances in supply and demand. Between spring and summer this year, after a large number of vegetables came on the market, there was a temporary oversupply. Although prices were continuously reduced, it still caused serious stagnation, backlog, and spoilage, and farmers were generally dissatisfied. The vegetable company's operations also lost money, resulting in a lose-lose situation. After signing the purchase and sale contracts, both parties conducted a more comprehensive study of production and sales conditions, which can gradually avoid the occurrence of the above situation.

    广州市蔬菜公司和农业社签订合同
    逐步做到蔬菜供应平衡
    新华社广州31日电　中国蔬菜公司广州市公司最近和市郊区各农业生产合作社签订了蔬菜购销合同。合同内容包括：蔬菜的品种、产量、价格和交货日期。签订合同后，农业社的社员们不用担心蔬菜的销路和亏本的威胁了。蔬菜公司方面也感到心中有数，经营上掌握了主动。
    在订立合同之前，蔬菜公司曾派出工作人员深入市郊区的农业社调查蔬菜的生产和成本情况，听取了他们的意见，并和市一级的商业等有关领导部门共同研究，然后在以销定产的原则下和农业社签订了七月份的购销合同。签订合同之后，蔬菜公司还经常派出工作人员分别和各农业社建立联系，了解他们的生产情况。
    广州市郊区气候温暖，土地肥沃，灌溉条件方便，一年四季都可以种植蔬菜，同时当地农民又有终年生产蔬菜的习惯。今年初，市郊区实现高级农业合作化后，农民们生产蔬菜更加积极。由于蔬菜公司对这些情况估计不足，和有关部门缺乏联系，加之蔬菜生产的季节不平衡，供求方面经常出现不协调现象。今年春夏之间，蔬菜大量上市后，一时供过于求，虽不断降低价格，仍然造成严重的滞销、积压和腐烂，农民普遍感到不满意，蔬菜公司的经营也蚀了本，弄得两头不讨好。签订购销合同后，双方较全面的研究生产和销路情况，能逐渐做到避免上述情况的发生。
