The breaches on the Weihe River in Henan Province, downstream of Jixian County, are also being actively prepared for and are beginning to be restored.

The Zhanghe River breach closure project began on the 11th and was completed today, using more than 50,000 cubic meters of earth. This project was undertaken by 6,000 civilian workers from Anyang and Linzhang counties, under the leadership of the joint breach closure command composed of Henan Province and Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province. Currently, the willow and stone revetment project at the Sanzongmiao dangerous section upstream of Erfenzhuang on the Zhanghe River is still under intense construction and will be completed soon. A portion of the breach in the Weihe River at Jixian County has also been restored.

On August 4th and 5th, the Zhanghe River, a tributary of the Weihe River, and the Weihe River itself experienced extraordinarily large floods. After the Zhanghe River diverted south at Erfenzhuang in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, there were still 24 breaches upstream and downstream of Erfenzhuang. The Weihe River breached in a total of 101 locations in Jixian, Junxian, Neihuang, and Nanle counties in Henan Province.
