    Yunnan Establishes a Large Farm

    (Our report) The Shizong County of Yunnan Province is currently building a relatively large state-owned farm. The area where this farm is located belongs to a small basin on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with a good climate and relatively fertile soil, allowing for at least two harvests of crops per year. Most of the land in the farm area is relatively flat, facilitating mechanized farming, and is suitable for planting crops such as soybeans, wheat, corn, potatoes, rice, peanuts, flue-cured tobacco, as well as economic trees such as tung oil trees and tea trees. There are also large areas of natural pasture suitable for developing animal husbandry. Since the farm's preparatory construction began this spring, it has partially commenced production, and the soybeans planted this year are generally growing well. The surveying team from the Yunnan Province Land Utilization Bureau, dispatched to the farm, has investigated the soil, plants, agriculture, and water conservancy in this nearly 100,000 mu (approx. 16,500 acres) area and conducted topographic surveys. They are now carrying out land planning for the fields within and between the farms based on these survey and mapping materials.

    云南建立一个大农场
    本报讯　云南省师宗县目前正在建设一处较大的国营农场。这个农场所在地区属于云贵高原上的一个小盆地，气候良好，土壤比较肥沃，一年至少可以收获两季庄稼。场区内大部土地较为平坦，便于机械耕作，并且适合种植大豆、小麦、玉米、马铃薯、水稻、花生、烤烟等作物以及油桐、茶树等经济林木，并有大面积的天然牧场适合发展畜牧业。农场自今春筹建以来即部分投入生产，今年种植的大豆普遍生长良好。云南省土地利用局派至农场的勘测队员们，已经在这个将近十万亩的场区内，调查了土壤、植物、农事、水利等情况，并进行了地形测量。现在正根据这些调查测绘材料进行场间场内的土地规划。
