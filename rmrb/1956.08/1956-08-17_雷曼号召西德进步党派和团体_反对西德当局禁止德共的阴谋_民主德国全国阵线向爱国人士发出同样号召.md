Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 16th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, delivered a radio address on German Democratic Radio on August 14th, calling on all progressive parties and groups in West Germany to firmly oppose the West German authorities' attempt to ban the activities of the German Communist Party.

Lehmann asked the Social Democrats and members of various trade unions in West Germany to recall the lessons of history. He emphasized that the reactionary forces' attempt to strike at the German Communist Party would be a signal for the persecution and prohibition of trade unions, Social Democrats, and all democrats, peace defenders, and patriotic people.

Lehmann called on West German Social Democratic Party members to assist in safeguarding the German Communist Party's right to exist. He pointed out that this was necessary in order to create the best prerequisites for joint action by the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party to overthrow the Adenauer regime, and to lead West Germany onto the path of easing tensions and guaranteeing security, and onto the path of freedom and happiness for all working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 16th: The National Front of Democratic Germany issued a statement calling on all German patriots to rise up against the West German authorities' conspiracy to ban the German Communist Party.

The National Front continued: Banning the German Communist Party would be a step towards West Germany's further slide into a totalitarian state, as well as a blow to Germany's peaceful reunification and the rights of West German workers.

The National Front warned that banning the German Communist Party would be a prelude to the persecution of the Social Democratic Party, trade unions, and other progressive forces. Therefore, defending the German Communist Party is also protecting the interests of Social Democrats, trade union members, Christians, youth, and all German people.

    反对西德当局禁止德共的阴谋

    据新华社柏林16日电　德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼八月十四日在德国民主电台发表广播演说，号召西德一切进步党派和团体坚决反对西德当局企图禁止德国共产党的活动。
    雷曼要求社会民主党人和西德各工会会员回忆历史教训。他强调指出，反动派企图给予德国共产党的打击，将是对工会和社会民主党以及所有民主人士、和平捍卫者和爱国人士进行迫害和禁止他们活动的信号。
    雷曼号召西德社会民主党党员协助维护德国共产党的生存权利，他指出，为了给德国共产党和社会民主党推翻阿登纳统治的联合行动创造最好的前提，为了使西德走上缓和紧张局势和保证安全的道路，走上全体劳动人民自由和幸福的道路，这样做是必要的。
    据新华社柏林16日电　民主德国全国阵线发表声明，号召全德爱国人士起来反对西德当局禁止德国共产党的阴谋。
    全国阵线接着指出：禁止德国共产党将是西德进一步走向极权国家的一个步骤，同时也是对德国的和平统一和西德工人权利的一个打击。
    全国阵线提出警告说，禁止德国共产党将是迫害社会民主党、工会和其他进步势力的先声。因此，保卫德国共产党也就是保护社会民主党人、工会会员、基督教徒、青年和全体德国人民的利益。
