    Don't Forget to Collect Rice Straw
    Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangxi Province are very busy with rushing to harvest and plant. Some cooperatives have forgotten about collecting rice straw. Rice straw is the main feed for draught cattle; if the rice straw is not collected and properly stored during this period, it will rot if left outside. If this happens, the cattle will have problems with food and bedding in the winter. I suggest that all cooperatives pay attention to this issue and take the straw back to the village during their spare time when harvesting. Sun Shifeng

    不要忘了收稻草
    目前江西省各农业生产合作社抢收抢种很繁忙，有些社，把收稻草的事情忘记了。稻草是耕牛的主要饲料；这个时期，如果不把稻草收回保管好，丢在外面就会烂掉。这样一来，到冬季耕牛吃睡都成问题。我建议各社注意这个问题，在收割的时候，利用空余时间带草回村。　孙师凤
