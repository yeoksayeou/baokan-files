Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th: The Shanghai and Guangzhou Purchasing and Supply Stations of the China Department Store Company jointly convened an ordering meeting here from the 4th to the 12th. Representatives from 252 department stores and clock, watch, eyeglass, candy, and pastry companies across the country ordered over 180 million yuan worth of goods for the fourth quarter from these two supply stations.

This meeting implemented a bottom-up supply method of requesting goods from various regions. Except for 18 types of commodities such as washbasins, steel pots, and sewing machines, which were allocated in quantity according to the decision of the company's 9th National Manager Conference, the quantity, variety, specifications, and brand names of the remaining commodities were completely freely selected by the representatives of various regions based on the needs of local consumers. The two stations set up sample rooms to facilitate their ordering after viewing samples.

This year, the quantity of goods requested by various regions is more than in previous years, and many commodities are in short supply. At the meeting, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station and the representatives of the industrial and handicraft departments participating in the meeting studied the issue of expanding supply and decided that Shanghai would increase production in the fourth quarter by 1.5 million pairs of rubber shoes, 280,000 dozen enamel mugs, and 6,000 dozen iron-shell thermos bottles to supply various regions. For the enamel pilaf plates needed by minority peoples, Shanghai originally planned to supply 700 dozen, but now it has increased to 1,200 dozen. These increased commodities have been included in the supply contracts signed with representatives from various regions. For commodities that cannot currently meet the needs of various regions, the supply stations have consulted with the ordering units to request that they select other marketable varieties and specifications.

At this meeting, high-quality and new-style commodities were welcomed, while poor-quality and old-fashioned commodities were unpopular. For example, Shanghai-produced Yu Ye fragrant soap, Gu Ben soap, Bai Yu toothpaste, and Guangzhou's Five Rams brand batteries and locks were all in short supply; while the Guangxin brand batteries produced in Guangzhou and other places were rarely requested by various regions. The two stations and the industrial departments jointly convened symposiums on six commodities, including toothpaste and toothbrushes, soap and fragrant soap, flashlights and batteries, rubber shoes, matches, enamelware, and thermos bottles, to collect the opinions of representatives from various regions on these commodities and prepare to study improvements.

    上海广州两个百货采购供应站联合召开订货会议
    实行自下而上要货的供应方式
    好货供不应求次货没人要应该研究改进
    新华社上海13日电　中国百货公司上海和广州两个采购供应站，从四日到十二日在这里联合召开了一次订货会议。全国各地二百五十二个百货和钟表眼镜、糖果糕点公司的代表，向这两个供应站订购了第四季度供应的总值一亿八千多万元的商品。
    这次会议实行了各地自下而上要货的供应方式。除了面盆、钢精锅、缝纫机等十八种商品在数量上按这个公司第九届全国经理会议的决定分配以外，其余商品不论数量和花色、规格、牌号，完全由各地代表根据当地消费者的需要自由选购。两站分别设立了样品间，便利他们看样订货。
    今年各地要货数量比历年多，许多商品供不应求。会上，上海采购供应站和参加会议的工业、手工业部门的代表对扩大供应问题作了研究，决定第四季度上海增产一百五十万双胶鞋、二十八万打搪瓷口杯、六千打铁壳热水瓶，供应各地；少数民族人民需要的搪瓷抓饭盘，上海原来计划供应七百打，现在增加到一千二百打。这些增加的商品已经订入同各地代表签订的供应合同中。目前还不能满足各地需要的商品，供应站都同要货单位协商，请他们另行选购可以适销的花色品种。
    在这次会议上，品质高、花色新的商品受到欢迎，质量差、式样老的商品不受欢迎。如上海生产的玉叶香皂、固本肥皂、白玉牙膏和广州的五羊牌电池、锁等都供不应求；而广州的新光牌电池等，各地要货就很少。两站和工业部门联合召开了牙膏牙刷、肥皂香皂、电筒电池、胶鞋、火柴、搪瓷器皿热水瓶等六个商品座谈会，收集了各地代表对这些商品的意见，准备研究改进。
