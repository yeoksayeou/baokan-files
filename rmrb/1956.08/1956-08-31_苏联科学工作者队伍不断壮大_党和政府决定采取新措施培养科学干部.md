Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th. The Soviet Union now has approximately 225,000 scientific workers, of whom about 10,000 are Doctors of Science and nearly 80,000 are Associate Doctors of Science. The number of scientific workers in the Soviet Union is now more than twenty times that of 1913.

Kirillin, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in an article published in "Pravda" on August 29th that the reason why Soviet science has been able to achieve success is the growth of so many scientific cadres since the establishment of the Soviet regime.

Not long ago, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers adopted a resolution stipulating some new measures to improve the training and evaluation of scientific cadres and teachers. This resolution has many supplements to the current system of training scientific cadres and will help to eliminate the main shortcomings in the training of young Soviet scientific cadres.

According to this resolution, newly recruited graduate students should have at least two years of practical work experience and have the ability to do scientific research. Only mathematics, theoretical physics, and other theoretical majors can recruit recent college graduates as graduate students.

In order to attract professionals with practical work experience to enter research institutes, the Soviet Union has also set up scholarships for them that are much higher than before.

    苏联科学工作者队伍不断壮大
    党和政府决定采取新措施培养科学干部
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联现在约有二十二万五千名科学工作人员，其中约有一万名是科学博士，将近八万名是科学副博士。现在苏联科学工作者的人数超过1913年的二十倍。
    苏联科学院通讯院士基里林8月29日在“真理报”发表的一篇文章中说，苏联在苏维埃政权成立以来成长了这样多的科学干部，是苏维埃科学能够取得成就的原因。
    不久以前，苏共中央和部长会议通过一项决议，规定了一些改善科学干部和师资的培养和考核工作的新措施。这一决议对现行的培养科学干部的制度有很多补充，并且将有助于消除在培养苏联青年科学干部方面的主要缺点。
    根据这一决议，新招收的研究生至少应当有两年实际工作经验，并且有科学研究工作能力。只有数学、理论物理学和其他一些理论专业，才能够招收高等学校刚刚毕业的学生作研究生。
    为了吸收有实际工作经验的专业人员进入研究院，苏联还为他们设立较前高得多的助学金。
