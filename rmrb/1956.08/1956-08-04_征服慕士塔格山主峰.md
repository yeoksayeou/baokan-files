After thirty-one members of the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team returned victoriously to the base camp at an altitude of 4,060 meters, they enthusiastically described to reporters the detailed process of conquering the main peak of Muztagh Ata.

At 9:00 AM (local time) on July 31st, thirty-one Chinese and Soviet team members began their assault on the main peak in a group from Camp Five at an altitude of 7,200 meters. After five days of living at high altitude and arduous marching, the physical strength of the Chinese and Soviet team members had been greatly depleted. At the same time, the team members encountered the serious difficulty of oxygen deprivation (at this altitude, even flying requires oxygen equipment). They opened their mouths wide, taking three or four breaths for every small step they took, and still felt it difficult to breathe. Sometimes, when a team member fell on the ice and snow, it took two or three minutes to get up. Other team members would help him carry his belongings, take off his high-altitude boots, and massage his legs and feet to improve blood circulation so that he could continue forward. In the high-altitude environment, Chinese and Soviet team members generally felt a loss of appetite. For several days, many of them could only eat a small amount of biscuits and apples. Experienced Soviet athletes said that the difficulties they encountered here were much greater than when they climbed Lenin Peak in the Soviet Union, which is over 7,100 meters above sea level.

The team members said that constantly relying on the collective and keeping in mind the glory and friendship of the Chinese and Soviet people gave them tremendous willpower. They said: At this critical juncture, if anyone forgets the collective and only cares about himself, he will lose the strength to continue fighting, remain on the mountainside, and even lose his life there.

Chinese and Soviet team members helped each other, climbing over one snow slope after another. When they could see the three cairns on the main peak, they were only fifty meters away from the summit. However, the extreme difficulties brought about by the terrain and environment, as well as the weakness of their limbs, took them about half an hour to finally place their last foot firmly on the summit.

Kuzmin, the deputy leader of the climbing team and a Merited Master of Sports of the Soviet Union, along with Master of Sports Goryaev, and Chinese athlete Chen Rongchang, were among the first to reach the summit at 12:55 PM (2:55 PM Beijing time). All thirty-one team members reached the summit by 2:00 PM. At this time, the wind force on the summit reached level seven or higher, the temperature was minus fourteen degrees Celsius, and the cold wind blew snow particles, which was extremely piercing. Although each team member was wearing four sets of high-quality cold-weather clothing, three pairs of woolen socks, and two pairs of warm gloves, many people's feet and hands were close to freezing.

Chinese athlete Guo Decun and Soviet first-class athlete Potapov planted the national flags of China and the Soviet Union on the summit. The team members shouted "Hurrah!" and "Long live!". Berezin, the captain of the Sino-Soviet joint climbing team, and deputy captains Kuzmin and Shi Zhanchun, placed a piece of paper signed by them in an iron tube and placed it in a crevice in the rocks on the mountain. The paper read: On July 31, 1956, at 14:00, thirty-one members of the Sino-Soviet climbing team reached the 7,546-meter summit of Muztagh Ata under normal weather conditions. All team members dedicate this climbing victory to the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

Chinese and Soviet team members collected some stones on the mountain and viewed the towering cliffs on the east side of the summit. In order to facilitate the study of the climate of Muztagh Ata by future climbers and scientists, they also placed a thermometer on the summit. Afterwards, they began to organize the team for the descent. At this time, it was 3:30 PM.

Berezin finally told reporters: British climbers should thank the Chinese athletes this time. Although the famous British climber Eric Shipton did not reach the summit of Muztagh Ata nine years ago, this time a British climbing rope was brought to the summit; it was largely carried up by young Chinese athletes. This climbing rope was given to Berezin in May this year by the head of the London Climbing Club when he was invited to visit London.

    征服慕士塔格山主峰
    新华社记者　杨克现
    中、苏混合爬山队三十一名队员胜利回到拔海4，060公尺的宿营基地以后，兴致勃勃地向记者叙述了征服慕士塔格山主峰的详细经过。
    七月三十一日上午九点（当地时间），三十一名中、苏队员开始从拔海七千二百公尺处的第五号高山营地结组向主峰冲锋。经过五天的高山生活和艰苦行军以后，中、苏队员的体力已经大大消耗。同时，队员们又遇到了氧气缺乏的严重困难（在这样的高度，坐飞机都要有氧气设备），他们张大着口，每移动很小一步就要喘三、四口气，仍然觉得呼吸困难。有时候，一个队员在冰雪上跌倒了，两、三分钟也爬不起，别的队员就帮助他背上东西，脱掉高山靴，并按摩他的腿和脚，使他血液畅通，能够继续前进。在高山环境下，中、苏队员普遍感到食欲不振，几天来，他们当中很多人只能吃少量的饼干和苹果。有经验的苏联运动员都说，他们在这里碰到的困难，比在苏联攀登拔海七千一百多公尺的列宁山峰的时候还要多得多。
    队员们说，时刻依靠着集体，紧记着中、苏两国人民的光荣与友谊，使他们产生了巨大的意志力量。他们说：在这种紧要的关头，如果谁忘记了集体，仅顾全个人，他就会丧失继续战斗的力量，停留在半山坡上，甚至在那里丧命。
    中、苏队员互相帮助，爬过一个雪坡又一个雪坡，当可以看见主峰上的三个石堆的时候，他们距离主峰只有五十多公尺了。但是，山势和环境带来的极端困难和四肢的无力，使他们花费了半个小时左右，才把自己最后一只脚稳稳当当地踏在峰顶上。
    爬山队副队长、苏联功勋运动员库兹明，运动健将戈热夫，中国运动员陈荣昌等第一批登上山顶的时间是十二点五十五分（北京时间下午两点五十五分）。全体三十一名队员登上山顶的时间是十四点。这时候，山顶上风力达到七级以上，气温是摄氏零下十四度，冷风吹着雪末，异常刺骨，虽然队员们每人都穿着四套高等质量的御寒衣、三双毛袜和两双保暖手套，但是，不少人的脚和手都快要冻僵了。
    中国运动员国德存和苏联一级运动员波塔波夫，把中、苏两国国旗插在山顶。队员们喊起了“乌拉！”和“万岁！”。中、苏混合爬山队队长别列次基，副队长库兹明、史占春把由他们签字的一张纸放入铁筒，安置在山上石头缝里。这张纸上写着：1956年7月31日14点零分，中、苏爬山队三十一名队员在正常的天气下登上了拔海7546公尺的慕士塔格山顶峰。全体队员把这次爬山的胜利，献给中、苏两国人民伟大的友谊。
    中、苏队员在山上搜集了一些石块，观看了顶峰东面的万丈悬岩。为了便利以后爬山运动员和科学工作者对慕士塔格山气候的研究，他们还把一个温度计放在山顶。随后，就开始整队下山。这时候，正是十五点半。
    别列次基最后向记者说：英国爬山运动员这次应该感谢中国运动员。虽然九年前英国著名爬山家埃·希普顿未曾攀登到慕士塔格山顶，但这次却有一支英国爬山绳被带上了顶峰；它在很大程度上是由年轻的中国运动员携带上去的。这支爬山绳是今年五月间别列次基应邀访问伦敦的时候，伦敦爬山俱乐部负责人赠送给他的。
