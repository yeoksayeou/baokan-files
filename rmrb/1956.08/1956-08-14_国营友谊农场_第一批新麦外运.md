Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 11th. The first transport trucks, loaded with new wheat, left the State-Run Friendship Farm yesterday. This is just twenty-one months from the day the first truck carrying Chinese and Soviet surveyors drove into the wasteland.

According to the contract signed with the local Grain Bureau, the farm plans to sell 18,000 tons of wheat to the state. This figure is nearly 80% more than the total amount of wheat sold to the state by all the farmers in Jixian County, where the farm is located, last year.

    国营友谊农场
    第一批新麦外运
    新华社佳木斯11日电　满载着新麦的运输汽车，昨天首次从国营友谊农场开出。这距离第一辆汽车搭载着中苏勘测人员开进荒地的日子，刚刚是二十一个月。
    按照和当地粮食局签订的合同，农场准备卖给国家一万八千吨小麦。这个数字和农场所在地集贤县全县农民去年卖给国家的小麦相比，还要多近80％。
