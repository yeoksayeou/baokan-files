Xinhua News Agency, August 15th dispatch from Damascus: The Syrian capital Damascus held a two-hour city-wide strike on the afternoon of August 14th, followed by a mass rally of 300,000 people at the city stadium to express Syria's support for Egypt in maintaining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The resolution of the conference stated that the internationalization of the Suez Canal or placing it under foreign control would be a clear violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.

The resolution stated that in the event of armed aggression against Egypt, Syria would consider it an attack on its own country and would therefore carry out legitimate self-defense against the aggressor. It will take all necessary measures caused by this situation, in particular blocking oil destined for aggressor countries.

Syrian Minister of Education Abdul Wahab Homad read out a government statement to the cheering crowd at the conference.

The statement said: "Those who hope to salvage the last vestige of weak relations between them and the Arab countries should understand that we will not be intimidated by their threats to defend our right to enjoy a free and prosperous life. They should know that if a fire starts, the flames will not be confined to the land they have chosen. No one knows when such a fire will be extinguished, nor where it will eventually burn."

Amid cheers, Homad said that Syria considered any aggression against Egypt to be directed against Syria, and Syria would devote all its strength to the battle.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th dispatch from Amman: More than 20,000 people held a rally and demonstration in Amman on the afternoon of August 14th to protest the Western countries' convening of the London conference in an attempt to internationalize the Suez Canal. All political parties and groups participated in the demonstration.

The demonstration adopted a resolution, believing that the Western countries' threat to Egypt is a threat to all Arab countries, and therefore it is necessary to mobilize all the military and economic potential of the Arab countries to deal with the aggression of the Western countries. The resolution also called on Arab countries to abolish all treaties concluded with Western countries, in particular demanding that Iraq withdraw from the Baghdad Pact.

The resolution said: Any attempt to use force to impose any form of international character on the Suez Canal will be resisted by force.

The resolution also stated: "We Jordanians will never allow the airports and military bases occupied by imperialism to be used as bases for aggression against Egypt."

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th dispatch from Beirut according to TASS on the 14th: Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan arrived in Beirut on August 13th on his way to London to attend the Suez Canal issue conference. He told reporters that Iran supports Egypt on the issue of the nationalization of the Suez Canal.

    叙利亚和约旦举行群众大会
    反对国际管制苏彝士运河阴谋
    表示将以全力支援埃及抵抗侵略者
    据新华社15日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚首都大马士革八月十四日下午举行了两小时的全市范围的罢工，随后有三十万人在市运动场上举行群众大会来表示叙利亚支持埃及维护它的领土和主权的完整。
    大会的决议说，苏彝士运河的国际化或是把它置于外国管理之下将是显然违反国际法和联合国宪章的。
    决议说，一旦对埃及进行武装侵略，叙利亚将认为这是对它本国的攻击，因此要对侵略国进行正当防卫。它将采取这种形势所引起的一切必要措施，特别是封锁运往侵略国家的石油。
    叙利亚教育部长阿卜杜勒·瓦哈布·霍马德在大会上向欢呼的群众宣读了政府的声明。
    声明说：“希望挽救他们和阿拉伯国家之间的仅存的微弱关系的人们应该了解，我们不会因为他们的威胁而不敢保卫我们享受自由而充裕的生活的权利。他们应该知道，如果着起火来，那末火焰就不会局限在他们所选定的土地上。谁也不知道这样一把火什么时候才能熄灭，也不知道它究竟会烧到什么地方。”
    霍马德在欢呼声中说，叙利亚认为对埃及的任何侵略都是针对着叙利亚的，叙利亚将把自己的全部力量投入战斗。
    据新华社15日讯　安曼消息：两万多人八月十四日下午在安曼举行了集会和示威游行，抗议西方国家召开伦敦会议，企图把苏彝士运河国际化。所有政党和团体都参加了这次示威。
    示威大会通过决议，认为西方国家对埃及的威胁就是对所有阿拉伯国家的威胁，因此有必要动员阿拉伯国家的一切军事潜力和经济潜力来对付西方国家的侵略。决议还要求阿拉伯国家废除同西方国家缔结的一切条约，特别是要求伊拉克退出巴格达条约。
    决议说：任何企图使用武力把任何形式的国际性质强加在苏彝士运河身上的企图都将受到武力的抵抗。
    这项决议还说：“我们约旦人决不让帝国主义占领的机场和军事基地被用作侵略埃及的基地。”
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特十四日讯：伊朗外交大臣阿达兰在前往伦敦参加苏彝士运河问题会议的途中，八月十三日到达贝鲁特。他告诉记者说，伊朗在苏彝士运河国有化的问题上支持埃及。
