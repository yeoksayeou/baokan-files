New Developments in the Countryside

"Three Treasures" Emerge by the Dam

Ma Keng Township, formerly in Shui Ji County in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, was a place plagued by drought "nine years out of ten." More than 1,200 mu of farmland were affected by drought. In 1954, although a stone dam was built across the river, it could only irrigate about 400 mu of land.

This spring, after more than 90% of the farmers in the township joined advanced cooperatives, the cooperative installed a water turbine pump next to the dam in order to achieve its grain production increase plan. As a result, 800 mu of fertile land were no longer threatened by drought, and an additional 120,000 jin of grain could be produced each year.

To the left of the water turbine pump, a small hydroelectric power station was also built. After electricity began to be supplied on August 1, a total of 890 electric lights were installed in the homes of 600 cooperative members. After the electric lights were installed, 62-year-old Xie exclaimed happily, "Our little mountain village now has a 'night-shining pearl'!"

Now, the cooperative members are using the electricity generated by the hydroelectric power station to power rice milling machines and flour milling machines to process rice and wheat. Two 15-horsepower electric processing plants are also under construction.

The cooperative members in Ma Keng Township regard the water turbine pump, hydroelectric power station, and electric processing plant as three treasures. They say: After setting up the advanced cooperative, "three treasures" emerged by the dam. Lü Rongxin

Never Dreamed Of

In recent days, the jars for holding grain at the Xigu County Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, have been selling particularly quickly. Tong Quanjie, a member of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, bought two large jars that can hold 1.6 shi of grain each.

Speaking of Tong Quanjie, he was originally a liberated farmer who cultivated 20 mu of land and raised an ox. His family of six had two full laborers. In the past, Tong Quanjie thought that his skills were high, his labor and livestock power were complete, and his land was good, so he was afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative and was unwilling to join. It wasn't until last winter that he joined the cooperative with everyone else. After joining the cooperative, he was always worried about low income and was uneasy. When the wheat was pre-distributed, his family received 1,300 jin of wheat and 55 yuan in cash, and his income increased a lot compared to before joining the cooperative. The whole family was overjoyed! His wife said, "I used to only hear that agricultural cooperatives were good, but now the benefits have come to our family!" Tong Quanjie said, "I never dreamed that my family could receive so much wheat this year. Adding the autumn grain, we will harvest twice as much as before joining the cooperative." After the pre-distribution, Tong Quanjie seemed to have completely changed and became exceptionally active in labor.

Field Agricultural Machinery Repairman

The women members of the Lutianlou Township in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, were spraying cotton aphids in the cotton fields when suddenly four sprayers broke down. Just as they were at a loss, Tang Hongxiang, the field inspection and repairman of the Bai Tie Production Cooperative, arrived. The women were so happy that they all shouted, "You've come just in time, just in time!" In less than an hour, Tang Hongxiang repaired the four broken sprayers and explained some usage and maintenance methods. When the sprayers sprayed out the thick white liquid again, the women praised Old Tang as a good doctor for sprayers.

Tang Hongxiang is one of the 55 field agricultural machinery repairmen organized by the Gaotang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. They adopted this method of going deep into the fields, inspecting, repairing, and imparting technology, which is very popular among the masses. Zhang Baoyi

    拦河坝边出“三宝”
    福建北部山区的原水吉县马坑乡，是一个“十年九旱”的地方。受旱农田有一千二百多亩。1954年，虽然修筑了一座拦河石坝，但也只能灌田四百来亩。
    今年春天，这个乡90％以上的农民加入了高级社后，社里为了实现粮食增产计划，在坝边安装了一部水轮泵。这样，就使八百亩良田不再受到旱灾的威胁，每年还可增产十二万斤谷子。
    在水轮泵的左面，还修起了一座小型水力发电站。八月一日开始送电后，已有六百户社员家里共装上了八百九十盏电灯。六十二岁的谢老太婆在安装上电灯后，高兴地说：“我们这个小山庄，也有了‘夜明珠’啦！”
    现在，社员们正利用水力发电站输送出的电流带动碾米机和磨面机，来加工稻谷和小麦。两个十五匹马力的电力加工厂，也在动工兴建中。
    马坑乡的社员们，把水轮泵、水电站、电力加工厂看作三件宝贝。他们说：办起了高级社，拦河坝边出了“三宝”。　吕榕辛
    做梦也没想到
    这几天，山西屯留县西故县乡供销合作社盛粮食的缸卖得特别快，光中苏友好农业社社员仝泉杰一户，就买了两个能盛一石六斗粮食的大缸。
    说起仝泉杰，他本是个翻身农民，耕种着二十亩土地，喂着一头牛。家中六口人就有两个全劳力。以前，仝泉杰认为他的技术高，劳、畜力全，土地好，光怕入社吃亏，一直不愿入社。直到去年冬他才跟着大家入了社，入社后老担心收入少，一直不放心。小麦预分了，他家除分了一千三百斤小麦以外，还分了五十五元现款，收入比入社前增加了很多。全家真是高兴透啦！他老婆说：“以前只听说农业社好，如今好处也到了咱家啦！”仝泉杰说：“我做梦也没想到过我家今年能分这么多小麦，再加上秋粮，比入社前要多收一倍。”预分以后，仝泉杰像完全换了个人一样，劳动格外积极。

    田间农械修配员
    山东省高唐县芦田楼乡的妇女社员们，正在棉田里用喷雾器杀棉蚜，突然四架喷雾器坏了，正在这为难的时候，白铁生产合作社田间巡回检修农械的唐洪祥来了，妇女们高兴得都叫了起来：“来得好，来得好！”不到一小时，唐洪祥把四架坏了的喷雾器修好了，还讲解了一些使用保管的方法。当喷雾器又喷出浓浓的白药浆时，喜的妇女们都称赞老唐真是喷雾器的好医生。
    唐洪祥是高唐县供销社组织的五十五名田间农械修配人员中的一个。他们就采取了这种深入田间，边检查、边修配、边传授技术的办法，很受群众欢迎。　张保义
