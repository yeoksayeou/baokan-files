    Survey of the Wuding River Basin Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th - The survey work of the Wuding River basin, the river with the highest sediment content in Shaanxi Province, has been completed.
    This survey was started in April this year by the Wuding River Survey Team of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. The team's more than 120 members were divided into thirteen groups, including riverbed geology, water conservancy surveying, and soil and water conservation, and conducted a comprehensive survey and measurement in seven counties in the Wuding River basin, including Suide, Mizhi, Yulin, and Hengshan, collecting various data for the Wuding River basin plan. At the same time, they repeatedly surveyed and studied the cascade development plan for this river, and successively measured ten comparative dam sites for reservoirs on the main and tributaries of the Wuding River, preparing to select them in the future to build four reservoirs on the main and tributaries, one of the most promising main stream reservoirs can control 50% of the sediment content of the Wuding River. If this is combined with other tributary reservoirs and soil and water conservation projects in the middle and lower reaches of the river, the sediment problem of the Wuding River can be basically solved.

    无定河流域勘查完成
    据新华社延安8日电　陕西省含沙量最多的无定河流域的勘查工作已经完成。
    这次勘查是黄河水利委员会无定河勘查队在今年四月开始的。勘查队的一百二十多名队员分为河道地质、水利测量、水土保持等十三个小组，分头在无定河流域的绥德、米脂、榆林、横山等七县进行了全面的勘查测量，搜集了关于无定河流域规划的种种资料。同时，还对这条河流的梯级开发计划反复地进行勘查研究，并先后在无定河的干支流上测量了十个水库的比较坝址，准备将来加以选择在干支流上建立四个水库，其中一个最有希望的干流水库可以控制无定河泥沙量的50％，如果再加上其他支流水库和这条河中下游水土保持工程的配合，就可以基本上解决无定河的泥沙问题。
