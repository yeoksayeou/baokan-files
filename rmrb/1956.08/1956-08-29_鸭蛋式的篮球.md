    Duck Egg Basketballs
    The Changchun Telecommunications School of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications bought forty-odd basketballs of the "Tiansheng," "555," and "Peace Dove" brands. From the outside, the balls looked good, but once inflated, they were really disappointing. The round ball became an egg shape and got stuck in the hoop, unable to fall through. These balls are unusable without repair. The factories that manufacture basketballs should not produce these "duck egg balls" anymore.

    鸭蛋式的篮球
    邮电部长春电讯学校买了四十几个篮球，都是“天生”、“五五五”、“和平鸽”三个牌子的。从外表看来，球还不错，一打上气可真叫人不高兴，圆球就成了鸭蛋形的了，扔进篮筐就卡住下不来。这种球不修理就不能用。制造篮球的工厂可别再生产这种“鸭蛋球”了。
