Unreasonable "Hardship Subsidy Standards"

To the Editor:

The leadership of the Administrative Office of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has some unreasonable practices in handling hardship subsidies for cadres. Mainly, they are lenient towards leading cadres, providing subsidies even when they are not warranted, while being overly strict with lower-level cadres, denying or reducing subsidies even when they are deserved. For example, Wu Bin, the director of the Secretariat of the General Office, has a family of six. He and his wife have a combined monthly income of more than 240 yuan, averaging more than 40 yuan per person per month. Logically, this should be a good standard of living, but the Administrative Office still approved a regular monthly subsidy of 20 yuan for him. On July 26th, the Administrative Office approved a temporary subsidy of 80 yuan for Director Wu, because Director Wu was experiencing “financial difficulties.” Whether Director Wu's life is truly difficult is worth investigating. Director Wu said that his family's living expenses are entirely covered by his salary, and his wife is studying at the Worker-Peasant Cultural Cadre School, which only covers 20 yuan for her meals, and no other expenses are provided. In reality, according to our understanding, his wife receives her full salary (101 yuan and 7 jiao and 6 fen) every month at the Worker-Peasant Cultural Cadre School. Director Wu has four children, two in nursery and two at home. For the two children at home, he employs two nannies, which doesn't seem like someone who is experiencing "financial difficulties." Director Wu said that he still owes 298 yuan in debts, but in July of this year, he spent 142 yuan to buy a radio. Based on these circumstances, the Welfare Section of the Administrative Office originally considered Director Wu's request for a temporary hardship subsidy to be unreasonable and did not approve it. However, Director Wu did not give up and requested a subsidy from Tie Cheng, the director of the Administrative Office. Director Tie told the comrades in the Welfare Section, "Don't be too stingy, you should be more lenient." He decided to approve a temporary subsidy of 80 yuan for Director Wu. Director Tie also instructed Comrade Yu Sulan of the Accounting Section, "Don't tell outsiders, it will be fine after a while when no one pursues it. The country doesn't care about these few yuan. The comrades in the Welfare Section are too stingy." I believe that solving difficulties for cadres is a good thing, a manifestation of the state's concern for the lives of the masses. Why does Director Tie half-conceal and half-reveal and not let others know? Doesn't he also feel that his actions are not "upright"?

In stark contrast to the "generous" subsidies for cadres like Director Wu, the Administrative Office controls hardship subsidies for lower-level cadres very strictly, and the financial difficulties of many comrades cannot be resolved in a timely manner. For example, Comrade Gong Shouyi of the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education has a wife and three children, with a monthly income of more than 59 yuan. His wife is often ill, which costs a lot in medical expenses, making their daily life very difficult. This past March, his wife returned to her parents' home and unfortunately fell ill on the way, costing more than 60 yuan in medical expenses, which he could not afford. He applied for a temporary subsidy of 50 yuan, but the Administrative Office said that his wife had been staying at her parents' home for several months, and he should have some savings during these months, and therefore did not grant the subsidy. In reality, he still had to provide living expenses for his wife while she was at her parents' home, so how could he have any "savings"? There are many cases like Comrade Gong Shouyi where subsidies should be granted but are not. I am just giving one example.

I think this is a problem and it is necessary to report it to the newspaper, to put these unreasonable things out in the open, so that everyone can judge and thereby urge our leaders to correct this unreasonable practice and do a good job in welfare work.

### 不合理的“困难补助标准”

    不合理的“困难补助标准”编辑同志：
    我们中共吉林省委办公厅行政处领导上在处理对干部的困难补助上，有些不合理的地方，主要是对领导干部宽，不该补助的也补助；对下面干部控制过严，该补助的也不补助或少补助。例如：办公厅秘书处吴斌处长，他家一共六口人，他和他爱人每月共收入二百四十多元，平均每人每月四十多元，按理说这样的生活是挺好的，可是行政处还批准他享受每月定期补助二十元的待遇。在七月二十六日行政处又批准给吴处长临时补助八十元，原因是吴处长“生活困难”。吴处长的生活是否真正困难呢？这是值得研究的。吴处长说他的家庭生活费用全由自己的工薪开支，爱人在工农文化干部学校学习，学校只负担二十元的伙食费，其他费用不发。实际上据我们了解，他爱人在工农文化干部学校每月都拿全薪（一百零一元七角六分）。吴处长的四个小孩，两个在保育院，两个在家。在家的两个小孩，就用两个保姆，看来也不像“生活困难”的人的样子。吴处长说他还欠外债298元，可是他在今年七月间还用142元买了一台收音机。根据这些情况，行政处福利科原来在研究吴处长的临时困难补助的请求时，认为吴处长的要求不合理，没有批准予以补助。但是，吴处长不死心，又向行政处铁城处长提出要求补助。铁处长对福利科的同志说：“你们不要太扣了，应当放宽一些”。决定批准给吴处长临时补助八十元。铁处长并指示会计科俞素兰同志说：“别向外人讲，过一个时期没人追究就算了，国家不在乎这几个钱。福利科同志太小气了”。我认为给干部解决困难是一件好事，是国家关心群众生活的表现，为什么铁处长还掩一半露一半地不让别人知道呢？是不是也感到自己的做法不够“光明正大”？
    与“慷慨”补助吴处长这样的干部的情况成鲜明对比的是：行政处对下面干部的生活困难补助却控制得很严格，许多同志的生活困难不能及时得到解决。例如：省委文教部宫守义同志，家里有爱人和三个孩子，每月收入五十九元多，爱人经常有病，花了不少医药费，平常生活就很困难。今年三月间他爱人回娘家，不幸中途得病，共花了医药费六十多元，无力负担，申请临时补助五十元，可是行政处却说，他爱人上娘家住了好几个月，在这几个月当中，他能有些积蓄，而不予补助。实际上，他爱人回娘家也得他供给生活费，怎能有“积蓄”呢？像宫守义同志这样应当补助而不予补助的情况，还有很多，我只是举一个例子。
    我觉得这是个问题，有必要向报纸反映一下，把这些不合理的事情摆在阳光之下，让大伙来评评理，借以督促我们机关领导上纠正这种不合理的作法，从而把福利工作作好。　多木
