    Munich Conference Report
    Record of the Seventh Post-War Congress of the West German Social Democratic Party
    He Jiang
    In the hot month of July, the second largest party in West Germany, the German Social Democratic Party, held its party congress at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. This was the seventh congress since the war. This four-day meeting attracted the attention of world opinion because the program determined by the West German Social Democratic Party at this national congress is not only the program of the opposition party, but also may be the administrative program of the ruling party, because the Social Democratic Party is actively striving to be in power after the West German federal parliamentary re-election next year, or to organize a coalition cabinet with other political parties.
    The chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, announced at the congress that he wanted to expand the influence of the West German Social Democratic Party to such an extent that "it would be impossible to govern without the Social Democratic Party." Many speakers at the congress criticized the idea of "not daring to participate in governing." The most obvious feature of this party congress that differed from previous congresses was that this congress showed a mood of striving to participate in governing after next year's election, and expressed the willingness to organize a "coalition cabinet" with any major party in West Germany (the Christian Democratic Union, or the Free Democratic Party and the Refugee Party).
    Change Foreign Policy
    After five hours of debate on the first day, the Munich Congress unanimously passed six resolutions concerning the West German Federal Government's foreign, domestic and military policies. The most important part of the West German Social Democratic Party's resolutions at this congress was the demand to change the Bonn government's current foreign policy, to strive to establish a European collective security system with a unified Germany participating, to amend the Paris Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty, to fully normalize diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, to establish diplomatic relations with China and other People's Democratic countries, and to sign trade agreements with the Soviet Union and China. In his speech, Ollenhauer condemned the Bonn cabinet headed by Adenauer for obstinately pursuing a policy of re-militarization regardless of the progress of the international situation, which placed the Federal Republic in a position of international political isolation.
    Obviously, these resolutions are in line with the wishes of the people of all countries and the German people to ease international tensions and maintain peace.
    The Key to German Reunification
    As for the key issue of German reunification—that is, the issue of negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic on promoting German reunification, the issue of unified action by the German working class, and the issue of consultation and cooperation between the German Social Democratic Party and the German Socialist Unity Party and the German Communist Party, the Munich Congress did not make any positive resolutions. In his speech, Ollenhauer adopted an attitude of refusing to cooperate on these issues. However, these issues are of general concern to the members of the West German Social Democratic Party. Many representatives, such as Möller from Frankfurt, Liek from Bavaria, Steffen from Kiel, and Wiesholler from Munich, all requested direct talks with the German Democratic Republic and the German Socialist Unity Party to discuss issues related to German reunification in their speeches. However, these mass demands were suppressed by the congress moderators through procedural means.
    Before the opening of the congress, among the ninety-four proposals received by the leading body of the West German Social Democratic Party, many were about criticizing the policy of the central leaders of the party towards the German Democratic Republic, the German Socialist Unity Party, and the German Communist Party. The central organ of the West German Social Democratic Party, "Vorwärts," surprisingly saw from these proposals "signs of a storm coming on the party's weather vane." However, during the congress, these proposals did not receive the full discussion they deserved. Many people who registered to speak at the congress did not get the opportunity to speak.
     Party Issues
    The congress discussed the issue of new blood in the party. However, the congress did not take corresponding effective measures on this issue.
    In the past few years, the number of members of the West German Social Democratic Party has been declining year by year. In 1948, the West German Social Democratic Party had about 900,000 members. By 1955, there were only more than 589,000 members. The average age of members is very high. Currently, more than 80% of the members of the West German Social Democratic Party joined the German Social Democratic Party or Social Democratic youth organizations before 1933.
    The issue of new blood is a serious issue within the West German Social Democratic Party. The Sixth Party Congress in 1954 specifically noted the problem that the number of new members joining the party each year was less than the number of members leaving the party, but the number of members leaving the party in 1955 was still higher than the number of new members joining the party.
    The fear of truly progressive-minded workers joining the party and engaging in progressive activities within the party is an important reason for the decline in the number of members of the West German Social Democratic Party. According to the figures published by the party's leading body, in 1955, more than 60% of the members expelled from the party were expelled on the grounds of so-called "working for the Communist Party or Communist peripheral organizations." This kind of punishment aroused opposition from the party masses. The universal demand of German Social Democratic Party workers and German Communist Party workers for unified action is precisely what the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party consider to be a sign of the so-called "storm."
    From the results of this Munich Congress, it is not yet possible to see a solution to this internal party problem.

    慕尼黑大会实况
    记西德社会民主党战后第七次代表大会
    何疆
    在炎热的七月里，西德第二大党德国社会民主党在慕尼黑德意志博物馆举行了党代表大会。这次大会是战后的第七次。这次为期四天的会议吸引了世界舆论的注意，原因是西德社会民主党在这次全国代表大会上所确定的纲领，不仅是反对党的纲领，而且还可能是执政党的施政纲领，因为社会民主党正在积极争取明年西德联邦议会改选之后能够执政，或者同其他政党组织联合内阁。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在代表大会上宣布要把西德社会民主党的影响扩大到如此程度，以致于“如果没有社会民主党就不可能执政”。大会上不少发言者批评了“不敢参加执政”的思想。这次党代表大会不同于以往几次代表大会的最显明的特点是：这次大会上表现出一种竭力争取在明年选举之后参与执政的情绪，并且表示了愿同西德任何大党（基督教民主联盟、或者自由民主党和难民党）组织“联合内阁”的意愿。
    改变外交政策
    慕尼黑代表大会在第一天经过五小时的辩论之后以一致票通过了有关西德联邦政府的外交、内政和军事政策的六个决议。西德社会民主党这次代表大会的决议的最主要部分是要求改变波恩现政府的外交政策，争取建立有统一后的德国参加的欧洲集体安全体系，修改巴黎条约和华沙条约，同苏联的外交关系充分地正常化，同中国和其他人民民主国家建交、同苏联和中国签订贸易协定。奥伦豪尔在发言中谴以阿登纳为首的波恩内阁不顾国际局势的进展而一意孤行地奉行重新军国主义化的政策，使联邦共和国处于一种在国际政治上孤立的地位。
    显然这些决议是符合世界各国人民和德国人民要求缓和国际局势和维护和平的愿望的。
    德国统一的关键
    至于德国统一的关键问题——即德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国进行关于促进德国统一的谈判问题、德国工人阶级的统一行动问题、德国社会民主党同德国统一社会党和德国共产党的协商和合作问题，慕尼黑代表大会却没有作出任何积极性的决议。奥伦豪尔在发言中对这些问题采取了拒绝合作的态度。然而这些问题却是西德社会民主党的党员群众所普遍关心的。法兰克福的代表莫勒、巴伐利亚的代表李克、基尔港的代表斯台芬、慕尼黑的代表维斯霍尔等许多代表都在发言中要求同德意志民主共和国、同德国统一社会党进行直接会谈，协商有关德国统一的问题。但是这些群众性的要求都被大会的主持者用程序上的手段压制下去。
    在大会未开幕之前，西德社会民主党领导机构所收到的九十四件提案中，有不少是关于批评党中央领导者对德意志民主共和国、对德国统一社会党和对德国共产党的政策的提案。西德社会民主党中央机关报“前进报”从这些提案中吃惊地看出了“党的气象表上预示暴风雨来临”的征兆。然而在代表大会开会期间，这些提案都未能获得应有的充分讨论。许多在大会上报名发言者没有得到发言的机会。
     党内问题
    大会曾讨论到党的新生力量问题。可是大会并没有在这个问题上采取相应的有效的措施。
    以往几年来，西德社会民主党的党员人数连年下降。1948年西德社会民主党党员约有九十万人。到1955年，只有五十八万九千多人。党员的平均年龄很高。目前西德社会民主党党员的80％以上是1933年以前参加德国社会民主党或社会民主党青年组织的。
    新生力量问题是西德社会民主党党内的严重问题。1954年第六次党代表大会曾特别注意到每年新入党的人数不及党员的减少数的问题，可是1955年的减少数仍然高于新入党者的人数。
    惧怕真正有进步思想的工人入党和在党内的进步活动，这是西德社会民主党党员人数下降的重要原因。根据党的领导机构所发表的数字，1955年被开除出党的党员中，有60％以上是用所谓“替共产党或共产党外围组织进行工作”的理由而被开除。这种处分办法引起了党员群众的反对。德国社会民主党工人和德国共产党工人要统一行动的普遍要求，正是社会民主党右翼领导人认为的所谓“暴风雨”的征兆。
    从这次慕尼黑代表大会的结果中，还看不出这个党内问题的解决的途径。
