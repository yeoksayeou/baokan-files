"Rotten Rice Straw" and "Magic Fungus"
　　Yà Guāng, Jìng Xián
    The product quality of the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill used to be very low, and the promotion of advanced experiences was quick to start but quick to fail. Everyone said: Advanced experiences are "magic fungus" in other factories, but they become "rotten rice straw" in the No. 1 Cotton Mill. Recently, they earnestly studied the experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill in leading the production upsurge, changed this situation, and improved product quality.

    Unpopular Cotton Yarn
    In March of this year, the Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company received another letter from the Hunan Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. The letter said: "The quality of the 'Changjiang Brand' 21-count cotton yarn is very poor, and production units do not use it. There is still a large backlog in our province, so please do not transfer any more."

    The Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had received many similar letters.

    This unpopular "Changjiang Brand" cotton yarn was produced by the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill. Before May of this year, the quality of the cotton yarn at this factory had been consistently poor. The Ministry of Textile Industry required that the standard product rate of cotton yarn should be at least 90%, but they were far from meeting this requirement. Since liberation, the factory had made some efforts to improve the quality of cotton yarn, but the results were not significant. When people talked about the quality of cotton yarn, they always liked to emphasize: "Our factory's machines are old, what can we do?" The fact that the machines were old was true; most of the machines in the factory were produced in 1920. However, could old machines definitely not produce good yarn? No one had seriously thought about it. When they visited the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the Yuhua Cotton Mill, they would return with a shrug: "Their machines are good, we can't spin good yarn even if we tried."

    Studying Honestly
    However, the people could not tolerate poor quality cotton yarn. Users constantly criticized the No. 1 Cotton Mill. In March, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also sharply criticized the No. 1 Cotton Mill at the provincial industrial and transportation political work conference, and designated the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal Textile Administration Bureau to help the No. 1 Cotton Mill improve its work. At this time, the factory's Party committee analyzed and criticized the conservative idea that old machines could not produce good yarn, and put forward the slogan "Machines may be old, but thinking is not. If there are difficulties, work harder." But it was still not clear in which direction they should work and how they should work.

    At this time, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to promote the experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill in leading the production upsurge. The Party secretary, manager, and chief engineer of the No. 1 Cotton Mill analyzed the situation of their factory and believed that it was not enough to rely on temporary measures as in the past to improve the quality of cotton yarn. The Yuhua Cotton Mill's in-depth efforts to strengthen basic and regular technical work gave them great inspiration. They began to make up their minds: They must honestly study the experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill. Therefore, the factory convened a production technology representative meeting and formulated a program of one hundred and ninety-three fundamental technical measures. Among these one hundred and ninety-three measures, and based on the experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill, they focused on eight major technical tasks and assigned specific personnel to be responsible for their implementation. At the same time, the factory streamlined all meetings that could be canceled, liberating cadres from the meeting circles. In this way, the factory's leaders were no longer always floating on top attending meetings. In addition to inspecting the workshops every day, they also led relevant personnel to the site every week to check the implementation of measures. As the leadership style changed, the work of grassroots personnel also became more in-depth, and many problems that needed to be solved could be solved in a timely manner, instead of being delayed as in the past. Once, when the manager went to the workshop, the workers pointed to the old motor transmission belt and said: "This kind of belt must be replaced, otherwise it will not work." The manager took a look and found that many belts were spliced and joined, and only then did he realize that this would affect the uniformity of the cotton yarn count. He immediately instructed the machinery and materials section to formulate a system and solved this problem, which the workers had raised several times in the past but had never been resolved.

    By the end of June, one hundred and eighty-five of the one hundred and ninety-three measures had been implemented, and these measures played a significant role in improving quality.

    Technical Personnel Also Mobilized
    In the process of learning from the experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill, they also paid attention to improving the work of technical personnel. This factory had a large number of technical personnel with a not-low technical level, but in the past, the leadership rarely gave them help, and many tasks were not entrusted to them; even at technical research meetings, the manager only wanted the chief engineer to express his attitude and made his own conclusions. Engineers also looked down on each other, and a technical leadership core was never formed. When problems arose in production, everyone argued at the meeting table, and no one went down to solve specific problems.

    Since Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals was published, engineering and technical personnel have been very excited. The factory's Party committee helped them criticize the passive emotions of thinking that doing less is better than doing more and the thinking of not being convinced by each other, and strengthened their sense of political responsibility. The leadership also gave them more leeway than in the past, and helped them establish a technical leadership core headed by the chief engineer, unifying the factory's process design.

    An atmosphere of humbly seeking opinions and learning from others' strengths became active among the technical personnel. They actively studied the Yuhua Cotton Mill's "quality tracking system" and made some improvements on the original basis. One day in early June, Tian Chengfang, the head of the experiment section, discovered that the unevenness rate of cotton yarn in the north mill was very high. He immediately worked with on-site engineer Zhai Minglai and others to track down the cause of the high unevenness rate, made timely improvements, and made the quality of cotton yarn reach first-class, first-grade.

    "Rotten Rice Straw" and "Magic Fungus"
    In addition to directly learning many advanced experiences of the Yuhua Cotton Mill, they also learned the spirit of the Yuhua Cotton Mill's humbly learning advanced experiences, and put forward the slogan "Go to wherever is advanced to learn."

    In the past, the No. 1 Cotton Mill had also promoted some advanced experiences, but because they were not combined with the actual situation of the factory, and the organizational work was not well coordinated, many experiences were quick to start but quick to fail. Everyone also said: Advanced experiences are "magic fungus" in other factories, but they become "rotten rice straw" in the No. 1 Cotton Mill. The south mill once promoted the experience of regularly raising and lowering the leaf board of the spinning frame last year, but because the method was rigid and the experiment failed once, they thought that this experience was useless and discarded it. This year, when they saw that the Yuhua Cotton Mill had successfully tested the regular raising and lowering of the leaf board, they realized that learning advanced experiences required combining them with the actual situation of the factory and repeated research. Therefore, they returned to the Yuhua Cotton Mill to learn the experience of regularly raising and lowering the leaf board. The head of the south mill, technicians, and workers experimented three times and finally succeeded. As a result, the yarn breakage rate decreased by 27%. In early May, they heard that the cleanliness work of the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory was well done, so the deputy manager led relevant employees to learn for three days. After returning, they seriously analyzed the situation of their factory and found that in the past, the workers on duty paid more attention to cleaning operations and did a poor job in the neatness of the machines. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing the workers on duty to strengthen cleaning work, they also specially cooperated with quality inspection and repaired and corrected the machine spacing according to the process design. As a result, the cleanliness work was completed within a week.

    Up to now, they have promoted a total of one hundred and one advanced experiences from outside factories and their own factory, and many advanced experiences have achieved the expected results.

    Old Machines Produce Good Yarn
    The experience of the Yuhua Cotton Mill has finally blossomed in the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill. From late May, the quality of cotton yarn at the No. 1 Cotton Mill has reached 100% first-class, first-grade. June coincided with the plum rain season, which is the most difficult time for spinning mills, and the grade of raw cotton was also lower than before, but they still had 99.66% of the cotton yarn reaching first-class, first-grade, and even produced 6.57% of the superior first-grade cotton yarn. In early and mid-July, the factory's cotton yarn maintained 98.99% first-class, first-grade, still breaking through the indicators of the Ministry of Textile Industry. Now no one in the factory says, "Old machines cannot produce good yarn anymore."

    “烂稻草”和“灵芝草”
    亚光　静娴
    武昌第一纱厂过去产品质量很低，先进经验推得快，垮得快。大家说：先进经验在别厂是“灵芝草”，到第一纱厂就成了“烂稻草”。最近，他们认真学习裕华纱厂领导生产高潮的经验，改变了这个情况，提高了产品质量。
    不受欢迎的棉纱
    今年三月，湖北省花纱布公司又收到湖南省花纱布公司的来信。信上说：“21支‘长江牌’棉纱质量低劣，生产单位不用，现在我省积压尚多，请再莫调来。”
    像这样的来信，湖北省花纱布公司收到的已经很不少了。
    这种不受用户欢迎的“长江牌”棉纱，是武昌第一纱厂出产的。今年五月份以前，这个工厂的棉纱质量一直很不好，纺织工业部要求棉纱的标准品率至少达到90％以上，但他们远远达不到这个要求。解放以来，厂里在提高棉纱质量方面，虽然也作过一些努力，但是效果都不大。大家谈起棉纱质量，总喜欢强调：“我们厂里的机器老嘛，有什么办法。”机器老是事实，厂里的机器大多是1920年出产的。但是，是不是老机器就一定不能出好纱呢？谁也没有认真思考过。他们到国营武汉第一棉纺织厂和裕华纱厂去参观，回来也是把嘴巴一扁：“人家的机器好嘛，叫我们去也纺得出好纱来。”
    老老实实地学习
    然而，人民不能容忍棉纱质量低劣。用户不断地向第一纱厂提出批评。三月份，中共湖北省委在全省工业交通政治工作会议上也尖锐地批评了第一纱厂，并且指定中共武汉市委和武汉市纺织管理局帮助第一纱厂改进工作。厂里的党委这时才分析批判了强调老机器不能出好纱的保守思想，提出“机器老思想不老，有困难多做工作”的口号。但是究竟应该向哪方面努力，怎样努力，还是不够明确的。
    这时候，中共武汉市委开始推广裕华纱厂领导生产高潮的经验。第一纱厂的党委书记、经理和总工程师们分析了本厂的情况，认为要提高棉纱质量，光靠过去那样采取临时性的措施是不行的。裕华纱厂深入下去，加强基础性、经常性的技术工作，给他们很大的启发。他们开始下了决心：一定要老老实实地学习裕华纱厂的经验。于是，厂里召开了生产技术代表会议，制定了一百九十三条带根本性的技术措施大纲。在这一百九十三条措施中，又根据裕华纱厂的经验，以八大技术工作为重点，责成专人负责贯彻执行。同时，厂里也精简了一切可开可不开的会议，把干部从会议圈子里解放出来。这样，厂的领导人员不再老是浮在上面开会了。他们除了每天下车间巡视外，每个星期还带领有关人员到现场去，检查措施执行情况。领导作风一转变，基层人员的工作也深入了，许多问题当解决的大都能及时解决，不再像过去那样拖拉。有一次经理到车间去，工人指着破旧的马达传动皮带说：“这样的皮带再不换就不行了。”经理一看，不少皮带拼了又接，才知道这样会影响棉纱支数的均匀，立即指示机物料科订出制度，解决了这个过去工人们提了几次，一直没有解决的问题。
    到六月底止，一百九十三条措施已经执行了一百八十五条，这些措施对提高质量起了很大的作用。
    技术人员也动起来了
    在学习裕华纱厂的经验中，他们也注意了改进对技术人员的工作。这个厂里的技术人员人数不少，技术水平不低，但是过去领导方面很少给他们帮助，许多工作都不放手给他们做；甚至在技术研究会上，经理也只要总工程师表示表示态度，自己来做结论。工程师之间也互相瞧不起，技术领导核心始终没有形成。生产上出了问题，大家在会议桌上各执一词，谁也不下去解决具体问题。
    自从周总理关于知识分子问题的报告公布后，工程技术人员都很兴奋。厂里的党委会帮助他们批判了过去认为多一事不如少一事的消极情绪和互不服气的思想，加强了政治责任感。领导上对他们也比过去放手，并且帮助他们建立了以总工程师为首的技术领导核心，统一了全厂的工艺设计。
    技术人员当中虚心征求意见，学习别人长处的空气活跃起来。他们积极学习裕华纱厂的“质量追踪制度”，并且在原有基础上作了一些改进。六月初的一天，试验科长田成方工程师发现北场棉纱不匀率很高，马上会同现场工程师翟鸣赉等追踪下去，找出不匀率高的原因，及时加以改进，使棉纱品质达到了一等一级。
    “烂稻草”和“灵芝草”
    除了直接学习裕华纱厂的许多先进经验外，他们还学习了裕华纱厂虚心学习先进经验的精神，提出了“哪里先进，就到哪里去学习”的口号。
    过去，第一纱厂也推广过一些先进经验，但是由于没有结合本厂的实际情况，组织工作也没有很好地配合，许多经验是推得快，垮得快。大家还说：先进经验在别厂是“灵芝草”，到第一纱厂就成了“烂稻草”。南纱场去年曾经推广过细纱机定期升降叶子板的经验，由于方法生硬，试验了一次没有成功，就认为这个经验不顶用，把它丢了。今年他们看到裕华纱厂试装定期升降叶子板成功，才体会到学习先进经验需要结合本厂实际情况，反复研究。于是他们重新到裕华纱厂去学习了定期升降叶子板的经验。南场场长、技术员和工人们试验了三次，终于试成功了，细纱断头率因而下降了27％。五月初，他们听说武汉国棉一厂的整洁工作做得好，就由副经理带领有关职工去学习了三天。回来以后，他们就认真地分析了本厂的情况，发现过去值车工对清洁操作注意多，对机械的整齐工作做得差，因此除了动员值车工加强清洁工作外，还特别配合质量检查，根据工艺设计检修校正了机器隔距，结果整洁工作在一周内就搞好了。
    到目前为止，他们共推广了外厂和本厂的先进经验一百零一条，许多先进经验都收到了预期的效果。
    老机器出了好纱
    裕华纱厂的经验终于在武昌第一纱厂开了花。从五月下旬起，第一纱厂的棉纱质量就百分之百地达到一等一级。六月份恰逢黄梅季节，正是纺纱厂生活最难做的时候，原棉品级又较以前降低了，但是他们仍有99.66％的棉纱达到一等一级，其中还出了6.57％的上等一级棉纱。七月上、中旬，这个工厂的棉纱保持了98.99％的一等一级，仍然突破了纺织工业部的指标。现在厂里再也没有人说：“老机器不能出好纱了。”
