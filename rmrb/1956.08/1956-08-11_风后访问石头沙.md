    Feng Hou Visits Shitousha
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Zhesheng
    On the 5th, there was still a force six wind on the Yangtze River. I took a patrol boat from a naval unit to visit Shitousha in Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province.
    Shitousha is located near the famous Wusongkou, in the center of the Yangtze River. During this typhoon, it was cut off from the mainland for five days.
    I boarded Shitousha and saw earth piled on the outer slopes of the dikes, with "straw cattle" tightly against the dike body. Although the river dike was impacted and damaged by the huge waves caused by the typhoon, it still stood firm.
    Shitousha has more than two hundred households, and more than 95% of the farmers have joined the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative. Under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative, the farmers of the whole island united and persisted in protecting the dikes, overcoming the powerful force twelve typhoon.
    On July 31st, the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative heard news about the typhoon approaching from the radio. The cooperative immediately conducted an inspection and found that out of the thirty-eight dikes in the whole cooperative, twenty-two needed flood prevention, and among them, the six dikes including Yanjiang Fuzi Dike, Laiyun Dike, and Laoyong Dike, which protected the most paddy fields, were the most dangerous. The cooperative leadership decided to concentrate the main forces of the six production teams of the whole cooperative to defend these dikes.
    The most intense day of fighting the typhoon was August 2nd. On this night, it rained heavily, and the storm rolled up waves as high as the roof, washing away half of the twelve-foot-wide Fuzi Dike. At this time, Sha Xilang, the captain of the Sixth Production Team, immediately led more than thirty young and strong men to Fuzi Dike in the heavy wind and rain, and carried out the work of raising and thickening the dike in a tense manner.
    Cooperative members Wang Liangfa, Wei Faqi, Wei Pinxiang and other fourteen people went to the Chai shoal, which was one mile away from the dike, to cut firewood. On the Chai shoal, they faced the storm, bent forward, their hands never stopped, and quickly cut down the reeds. When transporting them to the dike, because the wind was strong and it was difficult to carry firewood, the cooperative members bent their backs and dragged them by hand. Wang Liangfa dragged a bundle of reeds weighing more than thirty kilograms with one hand. The reeds became heavier and heavier with mud and water, and the skin on his hands was worn out, but he still didn't stop. He dragged thirty bundles of reeds in three hours.
    Ni Linlang, a forty-year-old cooperative member, was the oldest one guarding the dike. He stood on the most dangerous outer slope of the dike, digging soil to open ditches and place the wave-blocking "straw cattle." The rain soaked his cotton clothes, and the storm repeatedly knocked him down into the low-lying water pond under the dike. He struggled to stand up, wiped the mud off his face, and fought tenaciously again. Others advised him to rest for a while, he said: "No, now we need to tie down a few more straw cattle to secure the dike, so that the rice will not be flooded, and we can have a good life."
    The dike guarded by the Fifth Production Team was safe and sound, and they sent fifteen people to support the Sixth Production Team. They said: "The dikes on the sand are all of our cooperative, and we all have a share in it."
    People were driving piles, carrying soil, and tying ropes on and under the dike. After a day of continuous fighting in the wind and rain, the body of the Fuzi Dike was finally thickened to twelve feet wide and became more solid. When the high tide came at night, the flood roared, and the waves surged up the dike one after another, but they were all blocked back wave after wave.
    The several dikes that were as dangerous as Fuzi Dike were also very safe under the concerted efforts of the cooperative members.
    I visited Shao Hongfan and Shi Yinan, the deputy directors who led the cooperative's wind prevention struggle. They said: "This time, defeating the force twelve typhoon made us realize the benefits of cooperation even more." In 1949, they also suffered from a force nine typhoon. Because there was no preparation beforehand, and when the typhoon came, it was still individual farmers, each taking care of themselves. The flood broke through the dikes, and the breach of the Fuzi Dike alone flooded more than 100 mu of paddy fields.
    Although they suffered a force twelve typhoon this year, because the farmers were organized, worked together, unifiedly allocated labor, and concentrated their efforts to defend, they finally protected the dikes and the paddy fields were not flooded.
    Now, the more than 2,000 mu of green rice on this sand are growing very vigorously. If there are no unexpected disasters, a bumper harvest is expected. The cooperative members are still continuing to raise and thicken the several dikes along the river in order to resist the exceptionally large floods during the flood season.

    风后访问石头沙
    新华社记者　周哲生
    五日，长江江面上还有六级大风，记者乘海军某部的巡逻艇去江苏省宝山县石头沙访问。
    石头沙邻近著名的吴淞口，位在长江中心。在这次台风期间，这里和陆地断绝联系有五天。
    记者登上石头沙，看到一道道圩堤的外坡堆着泥土，“柴牛”紧贴堤身，江堤虽然被台风激起的巨浪冲击，受到了创伤，但是仍然屹立着。
    石头沙有二百多户人家，95％以上的农户参加了光明农业生产合作社。在农业社的领导下，全沙农民团结一致，坚持护堤，战胜了十二级的强大台风。
    光明农业社在七月三十一日，从收音机中听到关于台风侵袭的消息。社里立即进行检查，发现全社三十八道圩堤中需要防汛的就有二十二道，而其中又以保护稻田最多的沿江伏字圩、来云圩和老永圩等六道圩堤最为危险。社的领导上就决定把全社六个生产大队的主要力量集中防守这几道圩堤。
    和台风搏斗最紧张的一天是八月二日。这天夜里大雨倾盆，暴风卷起屋顶高的巨浪，把一丈二尺宽的伏字圩堤冲刷掉一半。这时候，第六生产大队队长沙习郎立即率领三十多个年轻力壮的小伙子冒着狂风暴雨赶上伏字圩，紧张地进行圩堤加高培厚工作。
    社员王良发、魏发其和韦品祥等十四人到离圩堤一里路外的柴滩割柴，他们在柴滩上顶着狂风，弯腰前进，两手不停，迅速地把芦苇割倒，往堤上运的时候，因为风大，挑柴难行，社员们就躬着腰用手拖。王良发一手拖一个重三十多斤的芦苇捆，芦苇拖泥带水越拖越重，手皮磨破了，还是不停，他在三个小时内拖了三十捆芦苇。
    四十岁的社员倪林郎是守卫圩堤中年纪最大的一个，他站在最险要的圩堤外坡挖土开沟安放挡浪的“柴牛”。雨水淋湿他的棉衣，狂风一次又一次地把他吹倒在堤下的洼水塘里，他挣扎站立起来，抹了抹脸上的泥水，又顽强地战斗。别人劝他休息一会，他说：“不行，现在多扎下几个柴牛，保牢圩堤，水稻不受水淹，才能过好日子。”
    第五生产大队守卫的圩堤平安无事，他们派来十五个人支援第六生产大队。他们说：“沙上的圩堤都是我们合作社的，都有我们的一份。”
    人们在堤上堤下打桩的打桩，捧土的捧土，绊绳的绊绳，经过了一个白天在风雨中不间断的战斗，终于把伏字圩堤身又加厚到一丈二尺宽，并且更加牢固。天黑晚潮来到的时候，洪水咆哮着，后浪推前浪地冲上堤来，但都一浪一浪的被挡了回去。
    和伏字圩同样险要的几道圩堤在社员同心协力的守卫下，也都很安全。
    记者访问了领导这个社防风斗争的副主任邵洪范和施义囝，他们说：“这次战胜了十二级台风更加体会到合作化的好处。”1949年他们这里也曾遭到一次九级大风的侵袭，因为事前没有准备，大风临头时，又是一家一户的个体农民，各人只顾自己，洪水冲破圩堤，光是伏字圩一道堤决口就淹了一百多亩稻田。
    今年这里虽然遭到了十二级台风的侵袭，但是由于农民组织起来了，齐心合力，统一调配劳力，集中力量防御，终于保住了圩堤，稻田没有受淹。
    现在，这个沙上的两千多亩绿油油的水稻长得很旺，如无意外灾害，可望丰收。社员们为了抵御汛期中的特大洪水，仍在沿江的几道圩堤上继续进行加高培厚工作。
