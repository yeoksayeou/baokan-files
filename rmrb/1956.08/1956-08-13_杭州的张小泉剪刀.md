    Hangzhou's Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors
    Tu Zhengfeng
    Tourists to West Lake all like to buy a few pairs of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors in Hangzhou to take home. Zhang Xiaoquan scissors are a famous product of Hangzhou with a history of over 100 years, known for their sharpness, durability, beautiful design, and variety of styles and colors. The products are sold domestically to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, and are exported to India, the South Seas, the Soviet Union, and various New Democratic countries. In 1952, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors were rated as the "Crown of Scissors in East China" at the East China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference. In the summer of 1953, they were also exhibited at the "Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition of the People's Republic of China" held in the Soviet Union, and received favorable comments from international friends. This year, the planned output of scissors is four million pairs, more than one and a half times the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War, but it still cannot meet the order requirements from various regions.
    Hangzhou's scissors manufacturing industry has a history of more than 300 years. A hundred years ago, a scissors maker named Zhang Xiaoquan gained a high reputation among the masses because of his high level of craftsmanship, meticulous production, and excellent quality of scissors. As Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors became famous, more than 40 scissors shops in Hangzhou were named Zhang Xiaoquan, Zhang Xiaoquan, or Zhang Xiaoquan, only distinguished by shop names such as "Jin Ji," "Yun Ji," and "Shuangjing Ji." Therefore, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors have become a symbol for Hangzhou scissors.
    Zhang Xiaoquan scissors are divided according to use into household scissors, barber scissors, men's and women's tailoring scissors, silk scissors and material scissors for industrial use, pruning shears, flower scissors, high branch scissors, and pig and sheep wool scissors for agriculture and animal husbandry, parcel scissors and document scissors for government use, umbilical cord scissors and surgical scissors for medical use, five-material scissors and emergency scissors for military use, and trick scissors for folk artists and handicraftsmen to cut paper, embroider, and cut fans, totaling more than 140 varieties. From the perspective of scissors decoration, there are nickel-plated and chrome-plated scissors that are bright like silver and not easy to rust, rattan-tied, velvet-tied, and copper wire-tied scissors that are beautiful and inexpensive and loved by farmers, as well as more economical and practical polished and natural-colored scissors. Nickel-plated and engraved scissors are very popular among users in Southeast Asia, India, and other countries.
    The styles and structures of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors are closely designed in conjunction with the characteristics of production. For example, "great scissors" with wide mouths, thick feet, and able to use great force are specially made for cotton mills to cut yarn packages, clothing factories to cut multiple layers of thick cloth, candy stores to cut candy, and shoe workshops to make shoe uppers and hat shops to make hats; "crab scissors" with wide heads, empty mouths, thick feet, and great force are for leather workers and burlap bag makers; "material scissors" and "silver flower scissors" with short heads, thick eyes, thick shoulders, and great force are for cutting copper and iron sheets; "flat flower scissors" with pointed heads, long and thin bodies are for cutting paper and lace; "sunflower seed scissors" that are small, exquisite, and portable are for trimming nails; "Western flat cloth scissors" that are movable and can be disassembled are suitable for medical use.
    The raw materials of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors are the same as those of ordinary scissors, but the scissors-making process is very complicated. First, blacksmiths draw pig iron into scissors blanks, then inlay steel, grind and oil; then white smiths fit the legs, rivet the eyes, and apply oil; then electroplate or tie velvet and engrave flowers, requiring more than 20 operations. The workers who make Zhang Xiaoquan scissors pay attention to every detail of these processes and create its advantages and characteristics. According to previous surveys, ordinary scissors can be used for about ten years. This year, when the rural visiting work group organized by Hangzhou visited the countryside during the Spring Festival, they found a pair of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors that had been used for more than 30 years in a farmer's home in Qicun Village, Kaiyuan Township, Yuyao County, and they were still in normal use. However, in the past 20 years, due to the Zhang Xiaoquan scissors industry seeing a wide range of sales, it has been contaminated with some capitalist business ideas, only producing popular varieties, resulting in a reduction in styles and colors, and a decline in the quality of general scissors. In order to comprehensively promote the excellent characteristics of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors, Hangzhou City has now organized three scissors production cooperatives and 27 joint public-private Zhang Xiaoquan scissors shops, with nearly a thousand workers, to carry out labor competitions to improve product quality. This year, Hangzhou City also established a Zhang Xiaoquan scissors variety and technology research group to study and summarize the characteristics of Hangzhou scissors manufacturing, formulate a relatively complete set of scissors-making operating procedures and specifications for various scissors, and gradually restore various Zhang Xiaoquan scissors that have been discontinued for 20 to 30 years. A few days ago, Hangzhou City held a scissors exhibition to widely solicit opinions from the masses, and according to the new requirements of people's lives, it is preparing to design and trial-produce a batch of new varieties. The output of scissors is required to reach eight million pairs within three years to meet the needs of people at home and abroad.

    杭州的张小泉剪刀
    屠正峰
    游西湖的人，都喜欢在杭州买几把张小泉的剪刀带回去。张小泉剪刀，是杭州有一百多年历史的名产，锐利耐用，式样美观，花色品种很多。产品在国内销到新疆、内蒙古、西藏、北京、天津、上海等地，国外运销到印度、南洋群岛、苏联和各新民主主义国家。1952年张小泉剪刀在华东区城乡物资交流大会上被评为：“华东剪刀之冠”；1953年夏天又在苏联举行的“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”上展出，得到了国际友人的好评。今年剪刀的计划产量是四百万把，较抗战前最高年产量超过一倍半，但仍不能满足各地订货的要求。
    杭州的制剪业已有三百多年的历史。一百年前制剪工人张小泉因为制剪的技艺高，制作精细，所产剪刀质量优良，在群众中得到很高的信誉。张小泉的剪刀出名了，杭州市四十多家剪刀店也都先后命名为张小泉、张小湶、张小全，只是以“近记”、“云记”、“双井记”等等来区别店号。因此，张小泉剪刀已成了杭州剪刀的代号。
    张小泉剪刀从用途来分，有家庭用剪、理发剪、男女裁剪，有供应工业用的丝巴剪、料剪，供农业、畜牧业用的修枝剪、花草剪、高枝剪和猪毛、羊毛剪，有供机关用的邮包剪、公文剪，有供医用的脐带剪、外科剪，有供军用的五料剪、急救剪，以及供民间艺人和手工业者剪纸、绣花、剪扇用的巧头剪等一百四十多种。从剪刀的装璜来分，有光亮似银、不易生锈的镀镍、镀克罗米剪，有美观价廉、为农民所喜爱的扎藤、扎绒、扎铜丝剪，还有更经济实惠的刮亮、本色剪。镀镍、刻花的剪刀很受南洋、印度等国外用户的欢迎。
    张小泉剪刀的式样和结构，都是密切地结合着生产的特点来设计的。例如，棉织厂剪纱包，被服厂剪多层厚布、糖果店剪糖、鞋作坊做鞋帮、制帽店做帽子等用的是特地制成的口阔、脚粗、能用大力的“伟剪”；供皮革工人和制麻袋工人用的，是头阔、口空、脚粗、力大的“蟹剪”；供剪铜铁皮用的，是短头、眼粗、肩粗力大的“料剪”“银花剪”；用来剪纸和剪花边的，是头尖、身长而细的“平花剪”；用来修指甲的，是小巧玲珑、可以随身携带的“瓜子剪”；适宜于医用的，是活动的、可以拆开的“西平布剪”。
    张小泉剪刀的原料同一般剪刀的用料一样，但是它的制剪工序却很复杂。先由钳工把生铁拔成剪坯，嵌钢、宕磨上油；再由白工合脚、钉眼、拷油；以后再电镀或扎绒、刻花，要经过二十多道操作手续。制作张小泉剪刀的工人们注意了这些工序中的每一个细节，创造了它的优点特色。据以往的调查，一般剪刀可以使用十年左右，今年春节杭州市组织的农村访问工作团访问农村时，曾在余姚县开元乡七村一个农民家里发现一把已经用了三十多年的张小泉剪刀，至今仍照常可用。可是近二十年来，由于张小泉剪刀业看到销路日广，沾染了一些资本主义经营思想，只生产畅销的品种，因而花色品种减少，一般剪刀的质量也有下降。为了全面发扬张小泉剪刀的优良特点，现在杭州市已经组织三个剪刀生产合作社和二十七家公私合营张小泉剪刀店、近千名工人开展了提高产品质量的劳动竞赛；杭州市在今年还成立了张小泉剪刀花色品种技术研究组，研究和总结了杭州剪刀制造的特点，制定了一套比较完整的制剪操作规程和各式剪刀的规格，并将已断档二、三十年的张小泉各式剪刀逐步恢复起来。前些日子杭州市举行了一次剪刀展览会，广泛吸收群众意见，根据人民生活的新要求，准备设计和试制一批新品种。剪刀的产量要求在三年内达到八百万把，以满足国内外人民的需要。
