Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 11th: The vast majority of fishing cooperatives in the Zhoushan Archipelago and Shengsi Islands of Zhejiang Province did a good job in typhoon prevention, greatly reducing the disaster situation. After a short period of repairing fishing boats and nets and replenishing tools, the fishing cooperatives on the islands have successively started to resume production from August 4th to 8th.

Before the strong typhoon struck, the fishermen had already received typhoon warnings from the radio. Under the urgent mobilization of party and government leading organs at all levels, they immediately carried out relatively adequate typhoon prevention work. One hundred and sixty-three fishermen on Langgang Mountain hoisted twenty-six small paired boats to the mountainside forty feet high, avoiding the impact of the sea waves. After the typhoon, the fishermen dragged these fishing boats back to the sea to catch mussels. The Xinzhan Fishing Cooperative in Dinghai County promptly sailed forty large fishing boats into a sheltered harbor to avoid the wind, all safe and sound, and all sailed to the waters of Sanxing and Wujiao on the evening of the 7th to resume production. Cangdong Fishing Cooperative on Liuheng Island, which was very close to the typhoon center and suffered greater losses, also quickly repaired the damaged fishing boats. After the 7th, seven large fishing boats and twelve pairs of small paired boats of this cooperative have resumed production. Of the more than 18,600 net headers in the Zhoushan area, except for the 5,500 damaged in Shengsi and other counties which are being repaired, the rest have been used to catch jellyfish and shrimp.

In order to support the fishermen in quickly resuming production, the Zhoushan Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting on the supply of fishery materials on August 6th. On the 7th, the relevant state-owned commercial institutions and supply and marketing cooperatives sent a large number of personnel to Ningbo, Fenghua, Xiangshan and other places to purchase moso bamboo and mao bamboo for the fishermen. The timber company has allocated 800 cubic meters of timber to supply the fishermen. The Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company decided to pre-purchase fish from the fishermen and pay a deposit. Banks and insurance companies are issuing loans to fishermen and making compensation for disaster losses respectively. The Zhoushan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Aquatic Products Bureau is about to start a training class for radio operators of fishing cooperatives to impart radio technology and meteorological knowledge.

    舟山群岛和嵊泗列岛渔民恢复生产
    新华社杭州11日电　浙江省舟山群岛和嵊泗列岛绝大多数渔业社防台工作做得好，灾情大大减轻。经过短时间抢修渔船、渔网和添补工具后，各岛渔业社已经从八月四日到八日先后开始恢复生产。
    这次强台风袭来以前，渔民已经从收音机中收听到台风警报。在各级党、政领导机关的紧急动员下，他们立即进行了较充分的防台工作。浪岗山一百六十三个渔民把二十六只小对船吊到四十尺高的半山上，免遭海浪冲击。台风过后，渔民们又把这批渔船拖下海去捕淡菜了。定海县新展渔业社四十只大捕船及时驶入避风港避风，全部安全无损，七日晚上都已驶往三星、乌礁一带洋面去生产了。离台中心很近，损失较大的六横岛苍洞渔业社，也很快抢修好被撞坏的渔船。七日以后，这个社的七只大捕船和十二对小对船都已经恢复生产。舟山专区共一万八千六百多张网头，除嵊泗等县损坏的五千五百张正在加以抢补外，其余都已经用来张捞海蜇和虾子了。
    为了支持渔民迅速恢复生产，舟山专署在八月六日召开了渔业物资供应会议。七日，有关的国营商业机构和供销社就派大批人员去宁波、奉化、象山等地，为渔民采购淡竹、毛竹。木材公司已经拨出八百立方公尺木材，供应渔民。水产供销公司决定向渔民预购鱼货，付给定金。银行和保险公司正在分别给渔民发放贷款和做好受灾损失的赔偿工作。舟山专署水产局即将开办渔业社收音员训练班，传授收音技术和气象知识。
