        Response to Criticism

    On July 14th, this newspaper published an article on page two entitled "The Interests of Peasants Should Not Be Harmed," criticizing the Datong Mining Bureau of Shanxi, the North China Datong Engineering Corporation, the Datong Municipal Engineering Company, the Datong Power Plant Engineering Office, the North China Second Engineering Office, and the Second Work Area of the Shanxi Provincial First Engineering Company for occupying farmers' land without going through land requisition procedures.

    Now, the North China Datong Engineering Corporation and the Second Work Area of the Shanxi Provincial First Construction Engineering Company have sent letters of self-criticism. The letters state that they have already sent special personnel to investigate the matter, apologized to the farmers, made appropriate arrangements and compensation for the losses caused to the farmers by the occupation of their land, ordered the engineering office to clear out the materials piled on the farmers' land and graves within a specified time, and cleaned up the area around the graves. At the same time, they have conducted education on the worker-peasant alliance for their employees, ensuring that they will earnestly implement the state's land requisition policy in the future.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    七月十四日本报二版发表了“不应该损害农民的利益”一文，批评山西大同矿务局、华北大同工程总公司、大同市工程公司、大同电厂工程处、华北第二工程处和山西省第一工程公司第二工区等，不办理征地手续就占用农民土地。
    现在，华北大同工程总公司和山西省第一建筑工程公司第二工区已经来信检讨。来信中说，他们已经派专人对此事进行检查，向农民道了歉，对占用农民田地给农民造成的损失进行了适当的处理和赔偿，责成工程处限期将堆在农民的土地及坟地里的材料清理腾出，并且在坟地周围进行清扫，同时对职工进行了工农联盟教育，保证今后认真执行国家征购土地政策。
