Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th - The Honghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daling Township, Xin Jin County, Liaoning Province, recently corrected its bias of underpricing manure accumulated by commune members. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all commune members in accumulating manure.

　　The Honghai Cooperative was formed by merging seventeen elementary cooperatives into an advanced cooperative. Last year, these elementary cooperatives all adopted the method of commune members accumulating their own manure, pricing it according to quality, and purchasing it by the cooperative, accumulating a lot of good quality manure. However, after merging into an advanced cooperative this spring, the cooperative emphasized collectivism and stipulated that the manure accumulated by commune members' families would all be counted as the cooperative's. Regardless of the amount of manure accumulated or the quality, each adult would be given half a斗 of grain per year, and each child would be given two and a half斤 of grain; a sow would be given five斗 of grain per year, and a general pig would be given three斗 of grain. As a result, the commune members' enthusiasm for accumulating manure was not high, and pig raising also decreased. In the first half of the year, the entire cooperative accumulated 32,700 fewer piles of manure compared to the same period last year.

　　Seeing that if this situation continued, the Honghai Cooperative's cadres realized that the whole society would be short of a lot of manure next year. To this end, on July 12, with the help of the work team of the Xin Jin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in the cooperative, the Honghai Cooperative held a special production team leader meeting to discuss the issue of manure accumulation. Everyone unanimously agreed to still adopt the method of commune members accumulating manure individually, with the cooperative purchasing it according to quality, and, based on the amount of manure needed in the coming year and the actual possibilities, signed manure accumulation contracts with the commune members; the cooperative guaranteed to supply the commune members with soil for accumulating manure in a timely manner, and the commune members guaranteed to deliver the manure on time, in quantity, and in quality. At the same time, the price of manure was divided into grades according to the type and quality of the manure. The commune members were generally satisfied.

### 作价合理社员才愿多积肥

    作价合理社员才愿多积肥
    新华社沈阳30日电　辽宁省新金县大岭乡红海农业生产合作社最近纠正了社用社员肥料折价过低的偏向。这大大地鼓舞了全社社员的积肥热情。
    红海社是由十七个初级社合并转成高级社的。去年这些初级社都采取社员自己攒粪、按质论价、归社收买的办法，积攒了很多质量好的粪肥。可是今春并成高级社后，社里强调集体，规定社员家庭积的肥都算社里的，每人一年不论积肥多少和质量好坏，一律规定为：大人半斗粮、小孩二斤半粮；一口母猪一年五斗粮，一般猪一年三斗粮。结果社员攒粪的积极性不高，养猪也减少了。全社上半年和去年同期相比，少积了三万二千七百堆粪。
    红海社的干部看到这种情况继续下去，明年全社会缺很多粪。为此，七月十二日，在来社工作的中共新金县委工作组帮助下，红海社专门召开了一次生产队长会议，讨论积肥问题。大家一致同意还是采取社员个人攒粪、社里按质论价收买的办法，并且根据来年用粪量和实际可能，和社员订立了积肥合同；社里保证及时供应社员攒粪用的泥土，社员保证按数、按质、按期交粪。同时根据粪肥的种类和质量不同，把粪价分成等级。社员普遍感到满意。
