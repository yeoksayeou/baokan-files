    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 27th: Sir Claude Corea, the Ceylonese High Commissioner in London, head of the Ceylon government delegation to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, and his wife, left London by plane on the 26th.
    Huan Xiang, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, and Roshchin, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy, went to the airport to see them off.
    The Ceylonese High Commissioner, who had just attended the London conference on the Suez issue, answered a question at the airport about why he did not support the American plan. He said: "This is because we believe that the conference should seek a basis for negotiations acceptable to both the canal users and Egypt." He said: "There are two basic arguments: one is that the canal is an integral part of Egypt, and the other is that nationalizing the canal is within the scope of Egypt's sovereignty." Corea expressed the hope that Western countries would seek a peaceful solution with the Egyptian government.

    锡兰政府代表团启程赴苏联并将来我国
    准备商谈锡兰同中苏建交问题
    新华社伦敦27日电　同中国和苏联商谈建立外交关系的锡兰政府代表团团长、锡兰驻伦敦高级专员柯里亚爵士和他的夫人26日乘飞机离开伦敦。
    中国驻英国代办宦乡和苏联代办罗什宁前往机场欢送。
    这位刚刚参加了关于苏彝士问题的伦敦会议的锡兰高级专员在机场回答了关于他为什么没有支持美国方案的问题。他说：“这是因为我们认为会议应当寻求一个运河使用者和埃及双方都可以接受的谈判基础。”他说：“有两个基本论点：一个是认为运河是埃及不可分割的一部分，另一个认为把运河收归国有是在埃及的主权范围以内。”柯里亚表示希望西方国家能够同埃及政府谋求一个和平解决的办法。
