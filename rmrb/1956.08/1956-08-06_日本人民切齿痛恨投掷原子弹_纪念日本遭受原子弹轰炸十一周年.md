The Japanese people, bearing the wounds of the atomic bombs, have for eleven years, on the days of the tragic atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, made solemn commemorations with blood and tears; and with hearts of fiery anger, they have accused the perpetrators of the atomic bombings to the whole world.

This August, as in last year, people from all walks of life in Japan will hold the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The days when Japan was bombed with atomic bombs have now become a common memorial day for people all over the world to oppose atomic weapons.

The atomic bomb dropped on the center of Hiroshima City burned down more than thirty square kilometers of Hiroshima City's land, destroyed nearly 70,000 households of Hiroshima residents, killed more than 200,000 people on the spot, and injured more than 100,000 people. The one dropped on Nagasaki also burned down more than ten square kilometers of land, destroyed more than 18,000 households, and killed and injured more than 70,000 people. Even now, there are still more than 100,000 Japanese people struggling on the line of death with atomic bomb-related illnesses. The Japanese people will never forget the two cursed moments of 8:15 a.m. on August 6 and 11:02 a.m. on August 9.

Although a full eleven years have passed, the harm that the atomic bomb brought to the Japanese people has not simply become a historical record like time itself. When we went to Japan last year to attend the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the bloodstained traces of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombing were still visible everywhere. The Japanese people still feel vividly about the tragic situation of the bombing eleven years ago. The orphans and widows of the victims have been living in pain, desolation, and poverty for eleven years. The injured and sick who survived by chance at that time are still dying one after another. Those who have survived to this day are all physically and mentally broken, some with scars all over their bodies, some with missing legs and arms, some with blindness, and some with internal organs and blood changed. They are no longer normal people. The harm of the atomic bomb is still tormenting every victim. Anyone with a little human sympathy will feel very heartbroken when they see the suffering of these atomic bomb victims. They have extended their hands for help, they want to live, they bitterly hate the dropping of the atomic bomb, they do not want a third atomic or hydrogen bomb to descend on the human race, and they are willing to dedicate their remaining lives to opposing atomic weapons.

Before the wounds of the atomic bomb have healed, hydrogen bomb tests on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean have brought new disasters and anxieties to the Japanese people. Japanese fishermen fishing on the high seas were injured by the radioactivity of the hydrogen bomb explosion. Aikichi Kuboyama, a crew member of the Fukuryu Maru, was deprived of his life, and a large number of fishermen lost their livelihoods because the radioactivity of the hydrogen bomb made the fish inedible. The disaster brought about by the hydrogen bomb test made the Japanese people feel that the threat of atomic weapons is still around them. Old hatreds and new grudges, the Japanese people's bitter hatred for those who dropped the atomic bombs and tested hydrogen bombs is conceivable.

But that's not all, airplanes carrying atomic bombs and cannons firing atomic weapons are being transported into Japan, and atomic war mongers are turning Japan into a base for preparing for atomic warfare. The Japanese people feel that they are facing a new and great disaster.

However, the Japanese people are not sitting idly by waiting for the arrival of new and great disasters. They express unparalleled anger at the atrocities and sinister intentions of the atomic maniacs. They are willing to unite with the people of all countries in the world, stand at the forefront of the anti-atomic weapons movement, and wage unremitting struggles against atomic weapons. As early as 1950, although the Japanese people were in very difficult conditions, more than six million people bravely and solemnly signed their names on the Stockholm Appeal against atomic weapons. The signature campaign against atomic and hydrogen bombs, which began in August 1954, had more than 38 million signatures by March of this year. The Japanese people are accusing the world of their tragic experiences, angrily protesting the threat of atomic war and demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The Japanese people's just struggle against atomic weapons has received warm support from the people all over the world. When people from all walks of life in Japan held the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs last August, the conference was attended by representatives from all walks of life in Japan and representatives of atomic and hydrogen bomb victims; more than fifty foreign representatives from fourteen countries were also invited to participate in the conference. This conference showed the strong desire and enormous power of the Japanese people to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and marked the upsurge of the Japanese people's movement to demand the banning of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The foreign representatives who attended the conference listened with heavy and angry hearts to the Japanese people's sad and indignant just accusations against the disasters caused by the dropping of atomic bombs and the testing of hydrogen bombs. The song "No more atomic bombs" is the common voice of the Japanese people and the people of the world.

The Chinese people, like all peace-loving people in the world, have always advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons and advocated the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Chinese people warmly participate in and support the movement against atomic weapons; more than 400 million people have signed their names against atomic weapons, powerfully expressing the Chinese people's unwavering will to safeguard peace. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the suffering of the neighboring Japanese people due to the atomic bombing and hydrogen bomb tests, and are willing to fully support the Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic weapons.

Last August, the Chinese people sent their own representatives to participate in the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Japan to express the Chinese people's support and sympathy to the Japanese people. From August 6th to 11th this year, people from all walks of life in Japan will hold the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo and Nagasaki. The Chinese people have also been invited to send a delegation to participate. We believe that this conference will further promote the powerful movement to ban atomic weapons, and further promote the unity of the people of Asia and the world in the common cause of banning atomic weapons, eliminating the threat of new wars, and ensuring world peace.

    日本人民切齿痛恨投掷原子弹
    纪念日本遭受原子弹轰炸十一周年
    刘宁一
    身负原子弹创伤的日本人民，十一年来，年年在广岛和长崎惨遭原子弹轰炸的日子，以血和泪作着沉痛的悼念；并以愤怒的心火，向全世界控诉原子弹投掷者的罪恶行为。
    今年八月，也像去年一样，日本各界人民要举行第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。日本被原子弹轰炸的日子，现在已经成为全世界人民为反对原子武器的共同纪念日了。
    投掷在广岛市中心的一颗原子弹，烧毁了广岛市的土地三十平方公里以上，炸毁了广岛居民近七万户，当场死去者二十多万人，伤者十多万人。投掷在长崎的一颗，也烧毁了土地十余平方公里，炸毁了居民一万八千余户，死伤各七万多人。直到现在，日本还有十多万人带着原子弹的病痛在死亡线上挣扎。日本人民永远忘不掉八月六日八点十五分和八月九日十一点零二分那两个可咒的时刻。
    时间虽然已经过了整整十一年，但是，原子弹带给日本人民的祸害，并没有像时间一样单纯地成为历史上的记载。去年我们去日本参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的时候，广岛、长崎被原子弹轰炸过的血泪斑斑的痕迹，还随处可以见到。日本人民对十一年以前被轰炸的惨状，也依然感觉历历在目。死难者的孤寡，十一年来一直是在痛苦、凄凉、贫困中过日子。当时侥幸死里逃生的伤病者，仍在一个接着一个地死去。迄今幸存者也都身心残破，有的创疤遍体，有的缺腿断臂，有的双目失明，有的内脏血液变了样，他们都不是正常的人了。原子弹的祸害还在折磨着每一个受害者。任何稍有人类同情心的人，看到这些原子弹受害者的痛苦情形，都会觉得十分心酸。他们伸出了求援之手，他们要活，他们切齿刻骨地痛恨投掷原子弹，他们不愿再有第三颗原子弹或氢弹降临人类的头上，他们愿为反对原子武器献出残生。
    原子弹的创伤未复，太平洋公海上的氢弹试验又给日本人民带来新的灾害和不安。在公海上捕鱼的日本渔民，由于氢弹爆炸的放射性而受到了伤害，福龙丸的船员久保山爱吉被夺去了生命，大批渔民因为氢弹的放射性使鱼不能食用而失掉了生计。氢弹试验所带来的灾难，使日本人民感到原子武器的威胁依然在自己的身边。旧恨新仇，日本人民对原子弹投掷者和氢弹试验者的切齿痛恨，是可想而知的。
    还不止此，载运原子弹的飞机和发射原子武器的大炮又正在运进日本，原子战争威胁者还正在把日本变成准备进行原子战争的基地，日本人民感到面临着新的巨大灾难。
    但是，日本人民不是坐着等待新的巨大灾难的到临，他们对原子狂人们的暴行和罪恶企图表示无比的愤怒，他们愿与世界各国人民团结在一起，站在反对原子武器运动的前列，为反对原子武器作坚持不懈的斗争。早在1950年，日本人民虽然处在非常困难条件下，但是六百多万人还是在反对原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上勇敢而严肃地签上了自己的名字。由1954年八月开始的禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动，到今年三月已有三千八百多万人签了名。日本人民向世界人民控诉自己的惨痛经历，愤怒地抗议原子战争的威胁和要求禁止原子武器。
    日本人民反对原子武器的正义斗争，得到全世界人民的热烈支持。去年八月，日本各界人民举行禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会时，参加大会的有日本各地各阶层的代表和原子弹和氢弹受害者的代表；还有十四个国家的五十多名外国代表也应邀参加了大会。这次大会显示了日本人民要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的强烈愿望和巨大的力量，标志着日本人民要求禁止原子弹氢弹运动的高涨。参加大会的外国代表们，以沉重而愤怒的心情，听到了日本人民对投掷原子弹和试验氢弹所造成的灾难的悲愤的正义的控诉。“不准再投原子弹”的歌声，是日本人民也是全世界人民的共同声音。
    中国人民同世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，一贯主张禁止原子武器，并主张把原子能用于和平目的。中国人民热烈参加并支持反对原子武器的运动；四亿以上的人签名反对原子武器，有力地表达了中国人民维护和平的不可动摇的意志。对于近邻的日本人民由于原子弹轰炸和氢弹试验所遭受的痛苦，中国人民抱着深切的同情，并愿全力支持日本人民为禁止原子武器所进行的斗争。
    去年八月，中国人民派遣了自己的代表，参加在日本举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，向日本人民表达了中国人民对他们的支持和慰问。今年八月六日至十一日，日本各界人民又将在东京和长崎举行第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，中国人民也已应邀派遣了代表团前往参加。我们相信，这次大会必将更进一步推进禁止原子武器的强大运动，进一步促进亚洲和全世界人民在禁止原子武器、消除新战争威胁、确保世界和平的共同事业中的团结。
