    People Practicing Tai Chi
    Lin Gang

    Mornings in Zhongshan Park are refreshing and tranquil. The humid air is filled with the delicate fragrance of lotus flowers. Beneath ancient cypress trees, beside rockeries and pavilions, in twos and threes, or groups of eight or ten, people are exercising everywhere. Some are practicing Tai Chi, some are “standing like a post,” and some are taking deep breaths. They are the earliest visitors to the park.

    Those practicing Tai Chi include men and women, the elderly, and young lads, all focusing intently on the movements of their hands and feet. Their entire bodies are light and agile, using no force at all, advancing and retreating in a continuous, unbroken flow. Those in the know can name the forms: Grasping the Sparrow's Tail, White Crane Spreads Its Wings, Playing the Lute, Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg…

    Beside those newly learning the movements, there is often a teacher guiding them: “Relax your chest,” “Straighten your back,” “Fingers pointing upward, palms forward,” “Loosen your waist,” “You’re off again, start over!”

    People rushing to work leave after practicing; those who stay are mostly chronic disease patients recuperating. They continue to exercise here, contemplating the forms.

    More and more visitors arrive. Often, people gather to watch. It's a pity most leave after a short while. If they watched longer, and listened to the practitioners' discussions, they would discover that Tai Chi is actually a form of medical exercise that has existed in our country since ancient times.

    Listen to their conversations. This tall man with thick glasses says that after practicing Tai Chi every day, followed by a round of "pushing hands," he feels relaxed and comfortable, and full of energy all day; the listener adds, "That's right, when you first came, your complexion was terrible, now you've gained weight and your face is rosy." A female comrade in a silk dress tells an even more "miraculous" story, saying that her neurasthenia and stomach problems, which had plagued her for six or seven years, were completely cured after a year and a half of practicing Tai Chi. Her weight has increased by ten pounds this year compared to last year, and she has returned to work. An old woman, who suffered from arthritis for many years, had to be helped out of the rickshaw when she first came to practice, and couldn't even step over the stones of the pavilion. Now look at her supporting her entire body weight on one leg, “Single Whip,” “Lift Hands,” how nimble! The teacher praises her as the best student. She now takes the trolley bus to practice every day, rain or shine.

    An internal medicine doctor from the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital also practices Tai Chi in Zhongshan Park. She originally had mild pulmonary tuberculosis. Practicing Tai Chi shortened her recovery process. She believes that Tai Chi effectively enhanced her physical strength and is indeed a very good form of medical exercise. It has a significant positive impact on the nervous system and blood circulation, making it particularly suitable for chronic disease patients as a fitness activity. She now frequently recommends her patients to practice Tai Chi.

    Every morning, when dew still clings to flowers and leaves, in Beihai, Temple of Heaven, Taoranting and other parks, many people are practicing Tai Chi to exercise their bodies. This is an integral part of mass sports activities in Beijing.

### 打太极拳的人们

    打太极拳的人们
    林钢
    中山公园的早晨，清爽而幽静。潮湿的空气里弥漫着阵阵荷花的清香。古柏树下，假山和亭榭旁边，三三两两，十个八个，到处都有人在锻炼身体。有打太极拳的，有“站桩”的，有作深呼吸的。他们是公园最早的游人。
    那些打太极拳的人，有男的，有女的，有老年人，也有年青小伙子，一个个全神贯注于自己的手足的运动。他们周身轻灵，丝毫不用力气，进退循环，绵绵不断。懂行的人叫得出这些拳式的名目：揽雀尾、白鹤亮翅、手挥琵琶、金鸡独立………。
    在刚学拳的人的身边，常有一位师父在旁指点：“涵胸”，“拔背”，“五指向上，掌心向前”，“松腰”，“又差了码儿了，重来”！
    赶着上班的人，打完拳就走了；留下来的，多半是在休养中的慢性病患者。他们继续在这里锻炼，揣摩拳式。
    游人渐渐多起来。常常有人围拢来看。可惜大多数人站一回就走了。他们若是多看看，听听打拳者们的谈论，就会发现太极拳原来是我国古代就有的一种医疗体育。
    你听听他们的谈论。这位带着深度眼镜的高个子说，每天打完拳，再来一盘“推手”，周身感到轻松、舒适，整天精神饱满；那听的接着说：“可不是，你刚来时，脸色多难看，如今人也见胖了，脸也红润了。”旁边一位穿香云纱短衫的女同志讲得更“神”了，说她的神经衰弱和胃病，有六、七年历史，打了一年半的太极拳，竟全愈了。她今年的体重比去年增加了十磅，而且恢复了工作。有一位老太太，多少年的关节炎，刚来打拳的时候，坐三轮要人架着上车，亭子的阶石也迈不上步。如今你看她用一条腿支持着全身的重量，“单鞭”“提手”，多么轻巧。老师夸她是最好的学生，她现在每天坐了电车来练拳，风雨无阻。
    北京苏联红十字医院有一位内科大夫也在中山公园练拳。她原来有轻度肺结核。打太极拳使她缩短了疗养的过程。她认为太极拳有效地增强了自己的体力，确实是一种很好的医疗体育。它对于神经系统和血液循环，有显著的良好影响，所以尤其适宜于慢性病患者作为健身运动。现在她经常介绍自己的病人去练太极拳。
    每天早晨，当露珠还沾在花儿和叶子上的时候，在北海、天坛、陶然亭等公园里，有不少人在那里打太极拳锻炼身体。这是北京群众性体育活动的一个组成部分。
