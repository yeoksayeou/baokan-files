	The "Hundred Schools of Thought" in Academics during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods
	Yang Rongguo
		The Social Environment of Contention
	The Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were the golden age of Chinese academic history. The reason it was a golden age is that everyone expressed their views on academic issues, resulting in the contention of a hundred schools of thought.
	Of course, the reason why a hundred schools could contend at that time was due to the social conditions that allowed for such contention.
	From the great slave uprising at the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, developing into the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, due to the use of iron tools and the improvement of productivity, society rapidly transformed from a racial slave system to a feudal system (this is how I see it; whether it's correct is another question). During this transformation, there was the decline of clan aristocrats, the struggle for liberation by slaves, and the increasing rise of emerging landlords and merchant classes. This greatly relaxed clan rule. Therefore, the relative democracy that originally existed only between clan aristocrats and clan members—free people—was strengthened, and the emerging forces also had some qualification to speak. For example, the "wealthy merchant of Jiang" might have "no official rank," but because of his wealth, he was "able to adorn his carriages with gold and jade, and his clothes with intricate patterns," "surpassing the court" and "bribing the lords." (See *Guoyu: Jin Yu*) He was able to "bribe the lords," indicating his power to speak.
	Also, precisely because clan rule was collapsing and the atmosphere of democracy was greatly enhanced, ministers in front of the ruler not only had a certain freedom of speech but were sometimes unrestrained and very impolite to the ruler.
	In the Spring and Autumn period, for example, when Duke Xiang of Jin listened to his mother Wen Ying and released the three commanders captured from Qin, the senior official Xian Zhen came, and upon learning that the three Qin commanders had been released, he was furious and "turned his back and spat" at Duke Xiang (see *Zuo Zhuan*, Duke Xi, year 33).
	In the Warring States period, for example, when King Xuan of Qi saw Yan Chu, he called out, "Chu, come forward!"—ordering Yan Chu to come before him. Yan Chu not only did not go but instead called out, "King, come forward!"—ordering King Xuan of Qi to come before Yan Chu (see *Strategies of the Warring States*, Qi Strategy 11). Mencius was similar to King Xuan of Qi. When the king asked Mencius about "high-ranking officials from the royal family," Mencius replied without hesitation that if the ruler committed offenses and repeatedly refused to listen to the ministers' advice, then the high-ranking officials from the royal family could "change the ruler's position"—overthrow the current ruler and replace him with a better one (see *Mencius*, Wan Zhang II). Another example is when "Fan Sui arrived in Qin," the King of Qin received him with the etiquette of host and guest. To seek advice from Fan Sui, the King of Qin knelt and asked, "How may I be fortunate enough to receive your teachings, sir?" Fan Sui replied with only a "yes." This happened three times! Finally, the King of Qin knelt (i.e., *ji*) and pleaded, "Sir, are you unfortunately unwilling to teach me?" Only then did Fan Sui speak (see *Strategies of the Warring States*, Qin Strategy 3 and 5).
	If there were not a democratic atmosphere among them, the above situations would be unimaginable. Later, in the era of centralized feudal autocracy, lacking a democratic atmosphere, such situations were not seen. Isn't this very obvious?
	On one hand, there was a certain democratic atmosphere, and everyone dared to speak. On the other hand, precisely because of the rapid social changes, academics gradually became popularized. Originally, academics were only owned by the government, and cultural officials could only "pass it down from father to son, to serve the king,"—to educate the sons of the king; even regarding academics themselves, they could only "carefully guard its principles, daring not to add or subtract" (see *Xunzi*, On Honor and Disgrace)—daring not to add or subtract anything. At this time, clan rule relaxed and moved toward disintegration, so academics also moved from the government to the people—Confucius was the first to bring academics to the people. At the same time, because Confucius held the principle of "education for all," many people received education and had the opportunity to explore academics, so academics developed vigorously.
	Confucius had a large number of disciples, as recorded: "Confucius taught his disciples poetry, books, rites, and music, about three thousand in total, with seventy-two who mastered the six arts" (see *Records of the Grand Historian*, The Confucian Family). Later, like Mozi, he also had "many followers and abundant disciples, filling the world" (see *Lüshi Chunqiu*, On Dyeing). Mencius also had "dozens of carriages and hundreds of followers." This not only made the academic atmosphere stronger but also led to the emergence of various schools of thought.
	During the Warring States period, some more enlightened ruling classes, such as Lord Pingyuan, Lord Xinling, Lord Chunshen, and Lord Mengchang, treated those with knowledge and ability with great courtesy, so many people with knowledge and ability competed to return to them. For example, Kong Chuan, a descendant of Confucius, and the logician Gongsun Long both worked as guests in Lord Pingyuan's house. Later, Lü Buwei did the same, also striving to attract many knowledgeable people to study academics with him.
	At the same time, famous cultural centers such as Zou and Lu, as well as Jixia in Qi, emerged.
	This was the general social environment that allowed the hundred schools to contend at that time.
		The Situation of Debate in the Contention
	Because there were many people exploring academics, everyone put forward different views and opinions on society and nature from their own class standpoint, all of which were "well-founded and logically coherent" (see *Xunzi*, Against the Twelve Philosophers). Therefore, various schools of thought emerged, with "the hundred schools of thought and various skills each having their own strengths" (see *Zhuangzi*, Tianxia)—each having its own set, mutually opposed.
	First, there was the opposition between Confucianism and Mohism.
	For example, Confucius advocated "benevolence," which was based on kinship, while Mozi advocated "universal love," which was "without discrimination"; the Confucians advocated elaborate funerals and long mourning periods, while the Mohists "regarded frugality as their principle" (see *Mencius*, Teng Wen Gong I); the Confucians "established fate," while the Mohists "opposed fate," and so on.
	It is worth noting that although their views were opposed and different, they each had their own advantages in exploring academics. For example, Confucius emphasized evidence: "Insufficient documents," without evidence, he would not speak. At the same time, regardless of the extent to which he achieved it, in the exploration of academics, he advocated "no presumption, no dogmatism, no obstinacy, no egoism" (see *Analects*, Zihan)—this is a very good attitude for learning. Mozi emphasized experience, and his "three criteria" used experience as the criterion for recognizing truth. At the same time, although he criticized Confucius, he still acknowledged Confucius's views that were "correct and unchangeable" (see *Mozi*, Gong Meng), not negating everything.
	Even Mencius, who was a very subjective person, "rejected Yang and Mo." Whether his rejections were appropriate or not is another question; but he had one good spirit, which was that he did indeed explore the works of Yang Zhu and Mo Di, so he could put forward the central ideas of Yang and Mo—Yang Zhu's "for myself" and Mo Di's "universal love." He grasped the central ideas of the other side and carried out analysis and criticism, so that it would not be shooting without a target. As long as the commentary is correct, it is easy to convince people.
	Because Mozi started this trend—grasping the central ideas and central arguments of the other side to carry out analysis and criticism—later mutual criticisms among the various schools of thought were aimed at the central arguments of the other side for analysis and criticism. This situation is specifically reflected in *Zhuangzi*, Tianxia chapter, *Xunzi*, On Obscurations chapter and Against the Twelve Philosophers chapter, as well as *Lüshi Chunqiu*, No Duality chapter. In particular, *Lüshi Chunqiu*, No Duality chapter and *Xunzi*, On Obscurations chapter, the former summarizes the central ideas of each school with one character—such as saying that Lao Dan valued "softness," Confucius valued "benevolence," Mo Di valued "universality," and Yang Sheng (Yang Zhu) valued "self," etc., while the latter appropriately criticized the other side's thoughts with one character—such as saying that "Mozi was obscured by 'use' and did not know 'culture,' Songzi (Song Jian) was obscured by 'desire' and did not know 'gain,'" and "Huizi was obscured by 'words' and did not know 'reality,' Zhuangzi was obscured by 'heaven' and did not know 'man,'" etc. This was a characteristic of academic debate at that time.
	Truth becomes clearer with debate. Because some scholars at that time held a pragmatic attitude and could grasp the other side's central ideas to carry out research and discussion, truth emerged.
	For example, Confucius advocated "heavenly mandate," while Mozi opposed it. He said: "How can it be called fate? Therefore, it should be called strength." (See *Mozi*, Against Fate II) Therefore, in the hands of Xunzi, this truth became clearer with debate. Although Xunzi belonged to the Confucian school, he should have followed the Confucian opinion and believed in heavenly mandate; however, on this point, he still acknowledged Mozi's opinion and even went a step further than Mozi, not only not believing in heavenly mandate but even believing that people should "control heavenly mandate and use it" (see *Xunzi*, On Heaven)—should conquer heavenly mandate, conquer heavenly mandate to be used by people.
	Mozi "clarified ghosts"—saying that there are ghosts and gods. Although this was a means for him to achieve universal love, it is difficult to believe that there are ghosts. Not only did Confucians like Xunzi not believe that there were ghosts, saying that the existence of ghosts was only felt when people were mentally confused or abnormal, but in reality, there were no ghosts, so they opposed "being preoccupied with shamans and praying for good omens" (see *Records of the Grand Historian*, Biography of Mencius and Xun Qing); the Legalist Han Fei was also the same. He also opposed "serving ghosts and gods, believing in divination and shamans" (see *Han Feizi*, Five Vermin), and advocated "making the people use their strength" (see *Han Feizi*, Six Opposites). Even the later Mohists, while elaborating on their teacher's other thoughts, such as the idea of universal love and scientific ideas, did not even mention his "clarifying ghosts." It can be seen that truth becomes clearer with debate.
	The opposition between Confucianism and Legalism is mainly manifested in the debate between "rule by rites" and "rule by law."
	In the Spring and Autumn period, politicians with a strong sense of fresh things, such as Zichan of Zheng and Fan Xuanzi of Jin, saw that society was undergoing rapid changes, with slaves striving for liberation and emerging forces rising; in this situation, naturally, rule by rites could not stand. Therefore, they wanted to implement rule by law. Only by implementing rule by law could many problems in the current reality be solved. However, in 536 BC, when Zichan implemented rule by law in Zheng, Shu Xiang of Jin heard about it and wrote to Zichan, saying that as a result, "the people know there are laws, then they will not fear the superiors, and will have a competitive heart,"—which would be detrimental to rule. Zichan insisted on his opinion, replying that "I am saving the world," and must implement it (see *Zuo Zhuan*, Duke Zhao, year 6). In 513 BC, Fan Xuanzi again wanted to implement rule by law in Jin, and Confucius opposed it when he heard about it, saying that as a result, there would be "no order between the noble and the lowly," and "how can a state be established?" Fan Xuanzi did not listen (see *Zuo Zhuan*, Duke Zhao, year 29).
	Even in the Warring States period, when Shang Yang wanted to implement rule by law in Qin, he had a fierce debate with Du Zhi and others. In the debate, Shang Yang's reasoning was that "governing the world does not follow one path, and benefiting the state does not imitate the ancients." As a result, Shang Yang won, and Qin vigorously implemented rule by law in 350 BC (see *The Book of Lord Shang* and *Records of the Grand Historian* 68, Biography of Lord Shang).
	Moreover, this debate was not only won by the Legalists, but even later Confucians, such as Xunzi, also affirmed rule by law. The "rites" he advocated were different from the traditional "rites" of the Confucians. His "rites" had the meaning of "law." His student Han Fei formally advocated rule by law, becoming the completer of the study of rule by law.
	Advocating "rule by law" conformed to the development of the current reality, while adhering to "rule by rites" was the opposite. Therefore, rule by law won. So the opposing Confucians, such as Xunzi, could not help but bow to this truth—affirming rule by law.
	As for the opposition between "name" and "Mo," one was to conceptualize concrete objects, negating concrete objects from conceptualization; the other was to seek truth from facts, what is what, and cannot turn right into wrong.
	For example, Gongsun Long said that "a white horse is not a horse." Why? He believed that white is related to color, and horse is related to shape; since it is only white color and horse shape, how can it be said to be a horse?
	The Mohists fought back against Gongsun Long from the perspective of facing reality. From the argument, they not only believed that a white horse is a horse, but also that a black horse is a horse; therefore, riding a white horse is riding a horse, and riding a black horse is also riding a horse.
	The Mohist argument is a path to truth.
	For another example, Gongsun Long and Kong Chuan debated in Lord Pingyuan's house about whether a servant had "three ears." Although Gongsun Long argued the issue of "the servant having three ears" in a very logical way, and Kong Chuan could not refute him, Kong Chuan still said to Lord Pingyuan: Although Gongsun Long said it in a very logical way, but it is very difficult to say "now that the servant has three ears," and it is not true, saying "the servant has two ears" is very easy, and it is true (see *Kong Congzi*, Gongsun Long). – Not admitting Gongsun Long's argument.
	The Confucian Xunzi also opposed it, saying that this group of logicians was "obscured by words and did not know reality" (see *Xunzi*, On Obscurations).
	Giving criticism to the Logicians was also Zou Yan, who was called the Yin-Yang school. From criticizing the Logicians, he believed that scholars' statements should "express ideas and communicate meanings," so that people "understand what is meant," and "not try to confuse each other"; the statements of the Logicians cannot "express ideas and communicate meanings," cannot "understand what is meant," but instead "confuse each other," which is very bad. At the same time, he also believed that scholars' mutual debates, whether the debate is won or lost, should hold such an attitude, that is, "the winner does not lose what they guard, and the loser gains what they seek, if so, then debate can be done!" (Liu Xiang's Bieli, see *Records of the Grand Historian*, Plains Lord Biography Collection Explanation) – meaning that scholars' debates are all for the pursuit of truth, so the "winner" certainly "does not lose what they guard" – what they guard is right, but do not be proud; and the loser should also be modest and should recognize that the reason why the other side won is that the other side's statement is the truth; since it is the truth, therefore, on one's own side, it is "gaining what they seek." This is a very good attitude to pursue truth.
	From the above discussions and debates on academics by various schools, we can clearly recognize that, due to their discussions and debates, the truthfulness of academics became increasingly clear. The specific manifestations are: (1) From "fate" to "anti-fate" to "controlling fate and using it"; (2) From "theism" to "atheism"; (3) From "rule by rites" to rule by law; (4) From "seemingly right but actually wrong" theories to "seeking truth from facts" theories.
	In addition, at that time, due to the development of the iron smelting industry, productivity rose, and the requirements for science and technology became increasingly urgent, which led to the development of scientific thought. The Mohists had a scientific tradition, and the later Mohists, from their debates with various schools, especially from their debates with the ideas of Hui Shi and Gongsun Long, in addition to leading to their methodology becoming increasingly rigorous—not only using analogy, induction, and deduction, but also knowing to grasp the essence of things from the contradictions of things (the so-called "similarity and difference intersect to get existence and non-existence") (see *The Mohist Canon*), etc.—the most important thing was that under the guidance of the idea that man can conquer nature, they discovered the principles of mechanics, the principles of optics, and the principles of geometry, forming a set of natural science theory.
	On one hand, there were scientific methods and theories; on the other hand, there were also scientific productions. In addition to the various craft products recorded in "The Artificers' Record," there was also considerable progress in water conservancy projects—there was Li Bing's Dujiangyan and Zheng Guo's Zheng Guo Canal (see *Records of the Grand Historian*, Treatise on Rivers and Canals). The construction of these two major water conservancy projects naturally further promoted the development of social productivity.
	Therefore, we can say that the contention of a hundred schools in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods not only improved the level of academic culture but also improved social productivity.
		Our Understanding of Contention
	The above contention of a hundred schools in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods gives us the following understanding:
	First, in the contention of each with their own learning, everyone should adhere to their own central arguments and carry out debates; in the debate, if it is found that some opinions of the other side are indeed correct, even if they are small, people should frankly admit it. Confucius was an opponent of Mozi, but Mozi admitted that some of Confucius's opinions were "correct and unchangeable." This is a very good attitude for learning! If it is something that is "not truthful," such as Mozi talking about the existence of ghosts, not only was it difficult for those with a little understanding at that time to agree, but even later Mohists abandoned it and did not mention it.
	Second, in the debate, it is necessary to grasp the central ideas and central arguments of the other side. In this way, it will not degenerate into arbitrary abuse, shooting without a target, and achieving seeking truth from facts; at the same time, if the analysis and criticism are correct, it will naturally be readily accepted by the other side.
	Third, in the debate, it is certainly necessary to adhere to one's own views and opinions, but after a certain period of time, from the increasingly clear truth, the other side's views or opinions are correct, so in addition to frankly admitting the other side's opinions, one's own incorrect places can also be modified accordingly. This is what Zou Yan pointed out: "Therefore, the winner does not lose what they guard, and the loser gains what they seek, if so, then debate can be done." This statement also reflects the general spirit of the debates between the various schools at that time. This general spirit is also what our current academic contention of a hundred schools should have.
	Fourth, the contention of a hundred schools, mutual debates, gradually approached truth and moved towards science from the contention and debates, thus leading to the development of science and technology, and further improving social productivity from the development of science and technology. Therefore, the contention of a hundred schools not only improved the level of science but also promoted social productivity.
	Fifth, the truthful conclusions they reached from the contention and debates, for example, atheism and the idea that man can conquer nature, had a great influence on later generations' ideas. The systematic atheistic ideas of Wang Chong and Fan Zhen naturally originated from the atheism of this era. The various technological sciences described in Jia Sixie's "Essential Skills for the Well-Being of the People," as well as the scientific inventions and scientific theories of Zhang Heng and Zu Chongzhi, were also guided by the idea that man can conquer nature of this era. Isn't this very clear?
	Today's era is essentially different from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. At that time, it only had a certain degree of democracy, while today is an era of people's democracy. Today's advocacy of the academic contention of a hundred schools is entirely conscious, and all conditions are more superior to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods by many times. In particular, today we have Marxism-Leninism, which is universally applicable, as our guide. Therefore, the upsurge of the academic contention of a hundred schools that has been set off today will not only be broad in scope but also have greater achievements, and will certainly lead to the improvement of the level of science, thereby accelerating our socialist construction.

    春秋战国时代学术上的“百家争鸣”
    杨荣国
          争鸣的社会环境
    春秋战国时代是中国学术史上的黄金时代。考其所以为黄金时代，就是大家对学术问题各抒所见，百家争鸣。
    当然，那时百家之所以能争鸣，是由于有其可以争鸣的社会条件。
    从西周末奴隶大暴动之后，发展至春秋战国时代，由于铁器的使用，生产力的提高，社会就急激地由种族奴隶制向封建制转化（我是这样看的，对不对是另一问题）。在这一转化的过程中，有氏族贵族的走向没落，有奴隶们的争取解放，又有新兴的地主和商人阶级的日趋上升。这就使得氏族统治大大松弛。因此，原来只是在氏族贵族和氏族成员——自由民之间有着相对的民主，这一来，民主的气氛增强，新兴的势力也稍有资格说话了。如“绛之富商”，他虽“无寻尺之禄”，但是因其富有，而“能金玉其车，交错其服”，“以过于朝”而“行诸侯之贿”。（见国语晋语）他能“行诸侯之贿”，可见其说话的力量。
    也正由于氏族统治走向崩溃，民主气氛大大增强，所以臣子在国君面前，不仅有他一定的说话自由，有时还肆无忌惮，对国君很不客气。
    在春秋时代，如晋襄公听了母亲文嬴的话，把从秦国俘获来的三帅释放了。但是，大夫先轸走来，问明秦的三帅已经被释放，大怒，对襄公便“不顾而唾”（见左传僖公三十三年）。
    在战国时代，比如，齐宣王见了颜斶，便叫“斶前！”——叫颜斶到他面前去。颜斶不但不去，反过来，还叫“王前！”——叫齐宣王到颜斶的面前去（见战国策齐策第十一）。孟子对齐宣王也是如此。王问到孟子关于“贵戚之卿”如何，孟子毫无忌惮地答复，国君犯了过，一再不听臣子的规谏，那末，贵戚之卿便可“易国君的位”，——把这一国君推倒下去，另换一个好的上来（见孟子万章下）。再如“范睢至秦”，秦王执宾主之礼以接待，秦王为了向范睢请教，还向范睢跪而请曰：“先生何以幸教寡人？”范睢答曰唯唯。“若是者三”！最后秦王还去跪（即跽）而请曰：“先生不幸教寡人乎？”于是范睢才答话（见战国策秦策第三第五）。
    在他们中间，如果不是有着民主的气氛，上述的这种种情况是不可以想像的。后来，到了中央集权的封建专制主义时代，缺乏民主气氛，就不见有这种情况，这不是很明显的吗？
    一面由于有着一定的民主气氛，大家尚敢于说话。另一面，也正由于社会的急激变革，学术逐渐普及起来。原来，学术只为官府所有，文化官只能“父子相传，以持（奉也）王公”，——教育王公大人的子弟；即对学术本身，也只能“谨守其数，慎不敢损益”（见荀子荣辱篇）——不敢稍有所增损；到了这时，氏族统治由松弛而走向瓦解，因之学术也由官府而走向民间，——孔子是最先把学术带到民间的一人。同时，由于孔子抱着“有教无类”的主旨，使许多人都受到教育，都有探讨学术的机会，所以学术得到蓬勃发展。
    孔子所带的徒弟的众多，据纪载：“孔子以诗书礼乐教弟子，盖三千焉，身通六艺者七十有二人”（见史记孔子世家）。其后如墨子，也“徒属弥众，弟子弥丰，充满天下”（见吕氏春秋当染篇）。孟子也有“后车数十乘，从者数百人”。这一来，不仅学术空气更加浓厚，也出现了各种学派。
    战国时代，某些较开明的统治阶级，如平原君、信陵君、春申君和孟尝君，他们给有学问有能力的以优礼，所以许多有学问有能力的人都争往归之，如孔子的后裔孔穿和名家公孙尨都在平原君那里作过客。其后吕不韦也是如此，也争取了不少有学问的人在他那里研究学问。
    同时，还出现了如邹与鲁以及齐之稷下这样有名的文化中心点。
    这是当时百家之所以能争鸣的一般社会环境。
          争鸣中论战的情况
    由于探讨学术的人众多，于是大家各从自己的阶级立场出发，对社会，对自然，提出了种种不同的主张和看法，都是“持之有故，言之成理”的（见荀子非十二子篇）。因此，出现了各种学派，所谓“百家众技，皆有所长”（见庄子天下篇）——各有一套，相互对立。
    首先是儒墨的对立。
    比如，孔子说以亲亲为主的“仁”，墨子便道“无差等的”“兼爱”；儒家主张厚葬久丧，墨家便“以薄为其道”（见孟子滕文公上）；儒家“立命”，墨家便“非命”，等等。
    值得注意的是，他们的主张虽处于对立，虽各有所不同，但是他们在对学术的探讨上，也有各自的优点。比如，孔子重证据：“文献不足，”无以为证，他便不说。同时，不论他所做到的程度如何，在学术的探讨上，他倡导要“毋意，毋必，毋固，毋我”（见论语子罕）——这是一个很好的治学态度。墨子重经验，他的“三表法”就是以经验作为认识真理的准则，同时，他虽然非难孔子，但是对孔子的“当而不可易者也”（见墨子公孟篇）的地方，他还是首肯，并不是一概抹煞。
    就是孟子，他是主观很强的人，他“辟杨墨”，不论他所辟的应不应该，对不对，这是另一个问题；但是他有一点好的精神，就是他对杨朱墨翟的著作，确是探讨过一番，所以他能把杨墨的中心思想提出来——杨子“为我”，墨氏“兼爱”。他把对方思想的中心抓住，进行分析批判，这样，就不会是无的放矢。只要评论得对，也就容易令人折服。
    因为墨子开了这一风气，——抓住对方的中心思想和中心论点来作分析批判，所以后来其他各家的互相论难，都是针对对方的中心论点来作分析批判。这个情况，具体地表现在庄子天下篇、荀子解蔽篇和非十二子篇、以及吕氏春秋不二篇中。特别是吕氏春秋不二篇和荀子解蔽篇，前者以一个字概括各家的中心思想——如说老聃贵“柔”，孔子贵“仁”，墨翟贵“兼”和阳生（杨朱）贵“己”等等，后者则以一个字恰当地批判了对方的思想——如说“墨子蔽于‘用’而不知‘文’，宋子（宋牼）蔽于‘欲’而不知‘得’”和“惠子蔽于‘辞’而不知‘实’，庄子蔽于‘天’而不知‘人’”等等。这是当时学术论战中的一个特色。
    真理是愈辩愈明的。由于当时有些学者们抱了实事求是的态度，又能抓住对方的思想中心进行研究讨论，所以真理也就出现。
    比如，孔子倡导“天命”，墨子反对。他说：“夫岂可以为其命哉？故以为其力也。”（见墨子非命下）于是，到了荀子手里，这道理愈辩愈明白。荀子虽属儒家，理应遵守儒家的意见而相信天命；可是，他在这点上，还是首肯了墨子的意见，并且还比墨子进了一步，不仅不相信天命，甚至认为人们应当“制天命而用之”，（见荀子天论）——应当征服天命，征服天命而为人们所用。
    墨子“明鬼”，——说是有鬼神。这虽然是他达到兼爱的一个手段，可是要说有鬼是难以令人置信的。不仅儒家如荀子，不认为有鬼，说有鬼只是人的精神恍惚或失常的时候，才感到有，实际上是没有的，因而反对“营于巫祝，信禨祥”（见史记孟子荀卿列传）；法家韩非也是如此。他也反对“事鬼神，信卜巫”（见韩非子亡征篇），而倡导“使民以力”（见韩非子六反篇）。就是墨家后学，对他老师其他思想，如兼爱的思想和科学的思想都加以阐扬，但是对他“明鬼”这一点，连提都没有提了。可见真理是愈辩愈明的。
    儒和法的对立，主要表现在“礼治”和“法治”之争的上面。
    在春秋时代，一般对新鲜事物感觉很强的政治家，如郑国的子产和晋国的范宣子，他们见到：当时社会在急激变革，有奴隶们的争取解放，又有新兴势力的抬头；在这情势之下，自然，礼治是站不住了。于是，他们就要施行法治。只有施行法治，才能解决当时现实发展中的许多问题。可是，公元前五三六年，当子产在郑国施行法治时，晋国叔向听到了，写信给子产，说是这一来，“民知有辟，则不忌于上，并有争心”，——会不利于统治。子产坚持他的意见，答复说，“吾以救世”，非行不可（见左传昭公六年）。到公元前五一三年，范宣子又要在晋国施行法治，孔子听到也反对，说是这一来，便“贵贱无序”了，又“何以为国”呢？范宣子没有理喻（见左昭二十九年传）。
    就是在战国时代，商鞅在秦国要施行法治时，还和杜挚他们展开过一番激烈的辩论。辩论中，商鞅的道理，就是“治世不一道，便国不法古”。结果，商鞅战胜，秦国于公元前三五○年厉行法治（见商君书及史记六十八商君列传）。
    并且，这一论争，不仅是法家战胜了，就是稍后的儒家，如荀子，他也给予法治以肯定。他所倡导的“礼”，便和儒家传统的“礼”不同，他的“礼”是带有“法”的意义的。到他的学生韩非便正式倡导法治，——成为法治学的完成者。
    倡导“法治”是符合当时现实的发展的，而坚持“礼治”则反是，因此，法治战胜。所以反对派的儒家，如荀子，也不能不在这一真理的面前低头，——肯定法治。
    至于“名”和“墨”的对立，一个是要把具体物概念化，从概念化中而否定具体物；一个则要求实事求是，什么就是什么，不能倒是为非。
    比如，公孙龙说“白马非马”。为什么呢？他认为：白是命色的，马是命形的；既只是白色和马形，怎的说是马呢？
    墨者从正视现实中给予公孙龙以反击。他从论证中，不仅认为白马是马，骊马（黑马）也是马；因之乘白马即是乘马，乘骊马也是乘马。
    墨者的论证是走向真理的途径。
    又如，公孙龙和孔穿在平原君家，辩论臧获（仆人）是否有“三只耳”的问题。尽管公孙龙论“臧有三耳”论证得头头是道，孔穿说他不过，但是孔穿还是对平原君说：虽然公孙龙说的头头是道，可是硬要说“今为臧三耳甚难而实非也”，说“谓臧两耳甚易而实是也”（见孔丛子公孙龙）。——不承认公孙龙的论证。
    儒家荀子也反对，说名家这班人是“蔽于辞而不知实”（见荀子解蔽篇）。
    给予名家批评的，还有被称为阴阳家的邹衍。他从对名家的批评中，认为学者的立说，应当“抒意通旨”，使人“明其所谓”，而“不务相迷”；像名家的立说，就不能“抒意通旨”，不能“明其所谓”，反而“相迷”，这是很不好的。同时，他还认为，学者们的互相论难，不论是论战胜了或是败了，都应当抱着这样的态度，就是“胜者不失其所守，不胜者得其所求，若是，故辩可为也！”（刘向别录，见史记平原君列传集解引）——意思就是学者们的论战都是为了追求真理，故战“胜者”固“不失其所守”——所守的对了，但不要骄傲；而不胜者亦应虚心，应认识对方之所以战胜，就是对方的立说是真理；既是真理，因而在自己一方面，就是“得其所求”。这是追求真理的很好的态度。
    从上述各家对学术的探讨与论战中，我们可以清楚地认识到，由于他们的探讨和论战，学术的真理性日益鲜明起来。具体的表现是：（一）由“宿命”而“非命”而“制天命而用之”；（二）由“有神论”而“无神论”；（三）由“礼治主义”走向法治主义；（四）由“似是而非”的理论走向“实事求是”的理论。
    加上当时因冶铁事业的发达，生产力抬头，对科学技术的要求益为迫切，这就引导到科学思想的开展。墨家本有科学的传统，墨家后学又从对各家的论战中，特别是从对惠施公孙龙思想的论战中，除了引导到他们的方法论日臻于严密——不仅是运用类比法、归纳法和演绎法，又知道从事物的矛盾中去把握事物的质（所谓“同异交得，放有无”）（见墨经），——等等之外，最重要的是在人定胜天的思想指导之下，发现了力学原理、光学原理和几何学原理，形成了一套自然科学理论。
    一方面有了科学的方法和理论；另一面也有了科学的制作。除“考工记”中所载各种工艺产品外，水利工程方面，更有长足的进展，——有李冰的都江堰和郑国的郑国渠（见史记河渠书）。这两大水利工程的建造，自然又引导了社会生产力的进一步发达。
    于是，我们可说，春秋战国时代的百家争鸣，既提高了学术文化的水平，又提高了社会的生产力。
        我们对争鸣的认识
    上述春秋战国时代的百家争鸣，所给予我们的认识是：
    第一，在各以其学而争鸣中，各人自应坚持各人的中心论点而进行论战；在论战当中，如果发现对方的某些意见确有是处，即使是点滴的，人们即应坦白承认。孔子是墨子的敌对派，可是墨子对孔子的某些意见，是“当而不可易”的，他就承认。这是一个很好的为学态度！如果是“非真理性”的东西，如墨子说到有鬼，不仅当时稍有认识者难以首肯，就是墨家后学也就把它摒弃不提了。
    第二，在论战中，关于对方的中心思想和中心论点，一定要掌握住。这样，既不会流于任意谩骂，无的放矢，达到实事求是；同时，如果所分析批判的是正确的话，自也为对方所乐于接受。
    第三，在论战中，固然要坚持自己的主张和看法，待到若干时候，从真理的愈辩愈明中，对方的主张或看法是正确的，于是自己除坦白承认对方的意见外，自己欠正确的地方也可因之而进行修正。这也就是邹衍所指出的：“故胜者不失其所守，不胜者得其所求，若是，故辩可为也。”他这一番话，也自反映出当时各学派论战的总的精神。这一总的精神，也是我们今日学术上百家争鸣所应有的。
    第四，百家争鸣，互相论难，就从争鸣论难中而日益接近真理，走向科学，因而引导到科学技术的发达，又从科学技术的发达中进一步提高了社会的生产力。所以百家争鸣，既提高了科学水平，又促进了社会的生产力。
    第五，他们从争鸣论难中所达到的真理性的结论，例如，无神论和人定胜天的思想都给予后代思想的影响很大，王充和范缜的系统的无神论思想自是由这一时代的无神论肇其端。贾思勰之“齐民要术”中所叙述的各种工艺科学，以及张衡和祖冲之的科学发明和科学理论，也是由这一时代的人定胜天思想导其绪。这不是很明白的吗？
    今日的时代，在本质上并不同于春秋战国时代。当时只具有某种程度的民主气息，而今天是人民民主时代。今日倡导学术上的百家争鸣，全然是自觉的，而一切条件又较春秋战国时代优越到不知若干倍。特别是今日有放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义作指导，因之今日所掀起的学术上的百家争鸣的高潮，不仅范围广大，而且成绩也就一定更大，更能引导到科学水平的提高，从而一定能加速我们的社会主义建设。
