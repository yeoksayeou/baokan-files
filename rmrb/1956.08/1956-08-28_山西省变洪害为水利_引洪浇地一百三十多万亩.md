Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 25th: Over the past month, agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have been transforming flood damage into water conservancy by diverting floodwaters to irrigate over 1.3 million mu of land while simultaneously preventing floods.

Since the beginning of summer, Shanxi Province has experienced heavy rainfall and significant flooding, with rivers and mountain streams overflowing. To prevent flood damage, agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and riverside areas throughout the province have generally adopted comprehensive measures such as upstream flood diversion for irrigation and downstream dike reinforcement for defense. In the Jinzhong region, the Ciyang River, which used to flood frequently during mountain torrents, saw farmers along the river fully utilize flood diversion and irrigation projects built in the upstream areas during this year's flood season. Downstream, emergency dike protection teams guarded the embankments around the clock in sections, safely weathering two major flood peaks.

The flood diversion and storage irrigation projects built in various areas were mostly put into use ahead of schedule. In order to reduce the amount of silt flowing from the Sanggan River into the Guanting Reservoir, farmers in Yanbei constructed various projects and channels that have already diverted floodwater to irrigate over 50,000 mu of land. In the Taihang Mountains, more than one hundred cadres in Gaoping County assisted farmers in blocking rivers and diverting water, irrigating more than 20,000 mu of land for eleven cooperatives. Nearly two hundred small reservoirs built by agricultural cooperatives in various areas universally opened their gates to release water during the most critical juncture of the flood outbreak in mid-July, reducing and slowing down the river flow, and averting dike breaches for the first time.

In July, Soviet water conservancy and soil improvement expert Banin visited the Sanggan River area in Yanbei and observed the farmers' flood irrigation practices. He spoke highly of flood irrigation, considering it an advanced experience of Shanxi farmers in fighting against waterlogging and drought disasters. He summarized six major benefits of using flood irrigation, including improving the topography of mountain slopes; burying pebbles and gravel on滩地to transform wasteland into arable land; reducing the amount of silt carried by rivers; and increasing soil moisture content. The Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau attaches great importance to the Soviet expert's suggestions and has requested that areas with suitable conditions fully utilize this year's favorable conditions of heavy rainfall and abundant water to vigorously develop flood irrigation.

### 山西省变洪害为水利  引洪浇地一百三十多万亩

    山西省变洪害为水利
    引洪浇地一百三十多万亩
    据新华社太原25日电　最近一个多月来，山西省各地农业社在防治洪水泛滥的同时，变洪害为水利，引洪浇地一百三十多万亩。
    山西省夏季以来雨多洪水大，河道和山涧充溢洪流。全省山地和沿河地区农业社为防治洪水危害，普遍采取了上游分洪灌溉、下游固堤防守等综合措施。晋中地区往年山洪暴发经常泛滥的磁窑河，今年汛期沿河农民把在上游地区修建的引洪灌溉工程全部运用起来，下游沿岸的抢险护堤突击队日夜分段防守堤防，安全度过了两次较大洪峰。
    各地修建的引洪、蓄洪灌溉工程大部分提前使用。雁北农民为减少桑干河向官厅水库贯注泥沙，修挖的各种工程和渠道已分洪浇地五万多亩。太行山区高平县一百多个干部协助农民拦河堵水，为十一个社浇地二万多亩。各地农业社修建的近二百个小型水库，在7月中旬洪水暴发最紧张的关头普遍开闸放水，减少和缓和了河水流量，首次避免了洪水决口。
    7月份苏联水利土壤改良专家巴宁在雁北地区参观了桑干河沿岸农民洪浇的情形，对洪浇评价很高，他认为这是山西农民向水旱灾害作斗争的先进经验，并且总结出利用洪浇有可以改善山坡地表地形；埋盖滩地卵石、砾石变荒地为耕地；减少河流携带泥沙；增加土壤含水量等六大好处。山西省水利局对苏联专家的建议十分重视，已要求有条件的地区充分利用今年雨多水大等洪浇的有利条件，大力开展洪浇。
