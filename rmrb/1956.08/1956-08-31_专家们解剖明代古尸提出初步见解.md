Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 30th. Teachers at the Subei Medical College have conducted research on five Ming Dynasty corpses discovered in Nantong and Yangzhou, Jiangsu, in February and May-June of this year.

    The teachers dissected three of the five corpses, conducting observations and research in areas such as histology, pathology, forensic medicine, bacteriology, parasitology, biology, physics, chemistry, and radiology. They focused particularly on a relatively comprehensive examination of the corpse of Peng Shujie.

    The question of whether these corpses are mummies or adipocere is of concern to people. The teachers believe that, in forensic medicine, there are three types of non-decomposed corpses: dry corpses (mummies), which are formed by the loss of moisture in the corpse in a dry environment, or artificially made with preservatives; adipocere, which is formed in a humid environment with little air, where the body itself is rich in fat, and the surrounding soil contains a large amount of minerals such as magnesium and calcium; and peat-tanned corpses, which are formed when the surrounding soil is acidic, giving the skin a leather-like texture and softening the bones, making them easy to cut. Judging from certain characteristics of the Peng Shujie corpse, which is somewhat representative, it resembles adipocere. However, its bone tissue can be cut without demineralization, and the liquids inside and outside the body are acidic, making it resemble a peat-tanned corpse. The formation of such corpses is related to China's climate, the coffins used for burial, and other burial conditions such as the depth, wetness, and dryness of the terrain. The teachers believe that it is worth studying whether this can be considered a special type in the classification of corpse changes.

    Why have these corpses been preserved for so long without rotting? The teachers said that the results of the examination showed that bacterial development has ceased inside these preserved ancient corpses, which is why the corpses do not decompose. They pointed out that this is related to the composition and airtightness of the coffin, the spices inside the coffin, and the rosin outside the coffin, with airtightness being the most important factor.

    The teachers cited materials to prove that the water in the coffin was not intentionally added as a preservative. Physical examination of the three-earth mixture outside the coffin showed that although its performance is similar to concrete, this three-earth mixture allows water to seep in by one centimeter every twenty-four hours when immersed in water. Bacterial culture of the coffin water showed no bacterial growth; various bacterial inhibition tests showed that bacteria grew well in the coffin water. In addition, a large amount of rush, which absorbs moisture, was placed inside the coffin, also indicating that the water inside the coffin was not artificially added. It seems that the three-earth mixture and rosin outside the coffin were prepared to prevent water from entering.

    The teachers said that the rapid color change inside and outside the corpse after it was removed from the coffin, as well as the color change of the coffin water after opening the coffin, were the result of oxidation upon contact with air. Certain odor-like phenomena that occurred after the corpse was removed from the coffin may have been caused by re-infection in the air. It is reported that the corpses of Peng Shujie and Sheng Yi have been fixed with formalin solution and stored in a deep basement after being removed from the coffin, and no special changes have been found. The remaining corpses, being relatively dry, are all displayed in the dissection room.

    Regarding whether the cells of the corpses still have life, the teachers said that this examination of Ming Dynasty corpses revealed that nucleoid-like substances could still be found in cartilage cells, but preliminary tissue culture and tissue oxygen consumption tests have shown that these cells are no longer alive.

    专家们解剖明代古尸提出初步见解
    据新华社南京30日电　苏北医学院的教师们对今年二月和五、六月在江苏南通和扬州发现的五具明代古尸进行了研究。
    教师们对于这五具尸体中的三具进行了解剖、组织、病理、法医、细菌、寄生虫、生物、物理、化学、放射线等方面的观察和研究，其中，着重对彭淑洁的尸体，进行了较全面的观察。
    这些尸体究竟是木乃伊还是尸腊，是人们关心的问题。教师们认为，在法医学上不腐败的尸体有三种，即干尸（木乃伊），是在干燥环境中尸体内水分脱失而成，或由人工应用防腐药品制成；尸腊，是在湿润的环境、空气稀少、尸体本身多脂肪，以及周围水土含多量镁、钙等矿物质的情况下形成的；泥炭鞣尸，是在周围水土呈酸性时形成的，它的皮肤像皮革，骨质软化，容易切断。从具有一定代表性的彭淑洁尸体的某些特点来看，它很像尸腊，但它的骨组织不经脱灰，就可以切断，体内外的液体呈酸性，所以它又像泥炭鞣尸。这种尸体的形成，是同中国的气候和埋葬用的棺木，以及其他埋葬情况如地形深浅，干湿等有关。教师们认为，这在尸体变化的分类上是否可以作为一种特殊类型，值得研究。
    这些尸体为什么保存了这样久还不腐烂？教师们说，检查的结果表明：在这种经过保存的古代尸体的内部，细菌发育已经停止，所以尸体可以不腐烂。他们指出，这和棺木的成分、密闭程度、棺内的香料以及棺外的松香有关，其中密闭是最主要的。
    教师们列举材料，证明棺中的水不是有意放进去的防腐剂。对棺外的三合土进行物理检查后，证明它的性能虽然像混凝土，但这种三合土放入水中，每二十四小时可以渗入水一公分。用棺水作细菌培养，不见有细菌生长；进行各种细菌抑菌试验，细菌在棺水里生长良好。此外，棺内放有大量吸收湿气的灯心草，也说明棺内的水不是人工放进去的。看来，棺外的三合土和松香也都是为了防水才备置的。
    教师们说，至于尸体出棺后内外部的颜色迅速变化以及开棺后棺水颜色的变化，是接触空气发生氧化的结果。尸体出棺后有某些类似发臭的现象，可能是在空气中再次感染发生的。据悉，彭淑洁和盛仪的尸体开棺后已经用福尔马林溶液固定，并保存在深层地下室，尚未发现有特殊变化。其余尸体因比较干燥，均陈列在解剖室中。
    关于尸体的细胞是否还有生命，教师们说，这次检查明代古尸，还可以发现软骨细胞中有核样物，但经过组织培养及组织耗氧试验，初步证明这些细胞已经没有生命。
