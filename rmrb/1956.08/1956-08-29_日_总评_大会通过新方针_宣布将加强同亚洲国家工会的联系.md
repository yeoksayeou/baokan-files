Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 28th: The seventh regular congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) concluded today after adopting a new movement policy.

After heated debate, the congress made partial revisions to the draft of this year's Sohyo movement policy proposed by the Sohyo headquarters. The most noteworthy modification was the deletion of the phrase "not participating in united struggles controlled by the Communist Party" from the draft. Japanese public opinion believes that this policy will pave the way for further unity of the Japanese working class.

The new movement policy advocates close ties with Chinese trade union organizations and calls for an early convening of an Asian-African trade union conference. At the same time, the congress deleted a section in the draft regarding strengthening ties with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

The movement policy, which will serve as the future action program for Sohyo's three million members, strongly advocates defending the lives and rights of workers. It calls for wage increases and opposes the so-called productivity improvement movement that strengthens capitalist exploitation.

The four-day congress issued a declaration guaranteeing to continue the struggle through the labor movement against any attempt by the United States to carry out military rule in the Far East. The declaration pointed out that Japan's allowing the United States to establish military bases in Japan runs counter to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Sohyo announced that Japanese workers will strive to defend the constitution renouncing war.

The congress declaration also stated that Sohyo will strengthen ties with trade unions in Asian countries.

The congress elected Yukio Haraguchi, chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Metal and Mining Workers' Unions, as the new chairman of Sohyo. Fujita Fujitaro, the former chairman of Sohyo, was recently elected as a member of the House of Councillors. Isao Ota, Akira Imamura, and Mitsuo Fujioka were elected as vice-chairmen of Sohyo. Akira Iwai was re-elected as Secretary-General.

    日“总评”大会通过新方针
    宣布将加强同亚洲国家工会的联系
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第七届定期大会今天在通过了新的运动方针后，宣布闭幕。
    大会经过剧烈的争辩，对“总评”总部提出的今年度“总评”运动方针草案作了部分的修改。最引人注意的修改是删除了草案中所提出的“不参加共产党所控制的联合斗争”。日本舆论认为，这个方针将为日本工人阶级的进一步团结开辟道路。
    新的运动方针主张密切同中国工会组织的联系，并且要求早日召开亚非工会会议。同时，大会删去了草案中关于加强同国际自由工会联合会的联系的一节。
    将成为“总评”三百万会员今后的行动纲领的运动方针，强烈主张保卫工人的生活和权利。它要求增加工资，反对使资本家加强剥削的所谓提高生产力运动。
    举行了四天的大会发表宣言，保证继续通过劳工运动进行斗争，反对美国对远东进行军事统治的任何企图。宣言指出，日本允许美国在日本建立军事基地的行为是与维护亚洲和世界和平的事业背道而驰的。“总评”宣布，日本工人将努力保卫弃绝战争的宪法。
    大会宣言还表示，“总评”将加强同亚洲国家工会的联系。
    大会选出了全日本金属矿山工会联合会委员长原口幸雄为“总评”的新的议长。“总评”原任议长藤田藤太郎最近已经当选为国会参议员。太田熏、今村彰、藤冈三男当选为“总评”副议长。岩井章连任事务局长。
