    Random Thoughts

    Handicraft cooperation and adjusting the commercial network are all good things.
    However, good things must also be done properly. According to the speeches of the representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress these past few days, it seems that these good things have not all been done well. Buying sesame cakes requires queuing, buying vegetables at retail stores requires queuing, leather shoes are broken and you can't find a cobbler willing to repair them, and washing a set of uniforms takes one or two months. Plus, sewing cooperatives don't care about altering old clothes, and electrical shops no longer handle repairs.
    It is said that this is scientific management and planning.
    Scientific management and planning are not good if they don't consider the consumer. *
    The second problem is the low quality of daily necessities.
    This outcry has been around for a long time. Critical articles have been written, cartoons have been drawn again and again, and exhibitions comparing quality have also been held. Everything that should have been done has been done; but the problem has not been resolved much.
    I think there is a way to solve the problem. Vice Premier Chen Yun mentioned at the National People's Congress meeting: "No place within the country shall adopt methods of mutual blockade." In other words, let high-quality daily necessities from all over the country be sold everywhere.

    手工业合作化，调整商业网，这全是好事情。
    可是，好事情也得看怎么做。据这几天北京市人民代表大会的代表们发言，好像这些好事情并没有全办好。买烧饼要排队了，到零售店买蔬菜要排队了，皮鞋破了，找不到肯给你修补的皮匠，洗一套制服得等上一、两个月，加上，缝纫合作社不管旧衣翻新，电料行不再管检修了。
    据说，这是科学化和计划性。
    科学化也好，计划性也好，如果不替消费者着想这就不好。＊
    其次一个问题是日用品品质低劣。
    这一呼声应该说由来已久。批评文章写过了，漫画画了又画，比较品质优劣的展览会也开过了。应该做的都做了；就是问题解决得不多。
    我想，要解决问题，也不是没有办法。陈云副总理在全国人民代表大会会议上提过：“国境以内，任何地方都不得采取互相封锁的办法”，换言之，就是让各地品质好的日用品到处可以销。
