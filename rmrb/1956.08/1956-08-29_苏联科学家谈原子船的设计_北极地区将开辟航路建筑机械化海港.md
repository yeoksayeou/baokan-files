Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Soviet scientists are continuing to design atomic power plants for peaceful purposes, and it has been decided that such plants will first be used in exceptionally powerful atomic icebreakers.

    Soviet engineer Moralevich pointed out in an article published in "Moscow Truth" that the Soviet Union's decision to install atomic engines in icebreakers first was based on the consideration that atomic plants would enable these ships to conquer the Arctic under very difficult conditions. Atomic ships will be built immediately after the icebreakers, because it would be uneconomical to guide ordinary ships with atomic icebreakers.

    The latest type of Soviet transport ship with a deadweight of 10,000 tons is suitable as a standard ship for atomic power. In a tightly sealed room on the atomic ship, the truly tireless heart of the ship, the reactor, will be placed. Its size and energy will be much smaller than that used on atomic icebreakers, because transport ships do not need to break thick ice, but the atomic power plant will still supply power to a propulsion engine of approximately 15,000 horsepower.

    Engineer Moralevich said that the United States had built an atomic submarine. But the result was a complete failure, which caused great distress to the builders and sailors. During the trial voyage, the submarine set sail using the atomic plant, but when it returned, the reactor was shut down and the diesel engine of the spare ordinary ship was started. Now the relevant American departments are still trying to overcome these shortcomings in the work.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Union is opening up sea routes in the Arctic region, constructing mechanized seaports, and preparing for scientific observations in the Arctic region during the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year.

    Rafailov, the head of the Soviet trust "Arctic Construction," which is responsible for construction in the Arctic region, said in response to questions from a "News" reporter that the main task of Soviet construction in the Arctic region is to open up the Northern Sea Route and make it a regularly navigable route.

    Rafailov said that the Soviet Union is establishing geomagnetic, geophysical, and high-altitude meteorological stations on Lonely Island north of 75 degrees north latitude, Rudolf Island north of 80 degrees north latitude, and Wrangel Island west of the Bering Strait.

### 苏联科学家谈原子船的设计  北极地区将开辟航路建筑机械化海港

    苏联科学家谈原子船的设计
    北极地区将开辟航路建筑机械化海港
    据新华社讯　苏联科学家在继续进行用于和平动力的原子装置的设计工作，并且已经决定这种装置将首先用于马力异常强大的原子破冰船。
    苏联工程师莫拉列维奇在“莫斯科真理报”上发表的文章中指出，苏联决定首先在破冰船上装置原子能发动机，是从原子装置能够使这种船只在非常困难的条件下征服北极的考虑出发的。在破冰船以后，就将立即建造原子船，因为靠原子破冰船来引导一般的轮船，那将是不经济的。
    苏联最新的一种载重量达一万吨的运输船，是适合用原子能的标准船只。在原子船的一个被严密地隔离开来的房间里，将安放真正不知疲倦的船只的心脏——反应堆。它的大小和能量都比原子破冰船上用的小得多。因为运输船用不着打破厚冰块，但是原子动力装置仍然将供应电力给约一万五千匹马力的推进机。
    莫拉列维奇工程师说，美国曾经建造过一艘原子潜水艇。但是结果完全失败了，这使建造者和海员们很苦恼。在试航的当中，这艘潜水艇靠原子装置启程航行，而回来的时候却关上了反应堆，开动了备用的普通轮船的柴油发动机。现在美国有关方面还在设法克服这些工作中的缺点。
    据新华社讯　苏联正在北极地区开辟航路，建设机械化的海港，并且筹备在1957—58年国际地球物理学年期间在北极地区进行科学观察的工作。
    苏联负责在北极地区进行建设的托辣斯“北极建设”的负责人拉法伊洛夫在答复“消息报”记者提出的问题时说，苏联在北极地区进行建设的主要任务是开辟北方海路，使它成为能够经常通航的航线。
    拉法伊洛夫说，苏联正在北纬七十五度以北的孤独岛、北纬八十度以北的鲁道尔夫岛和白令海峡以西的弗朗格尔岛上建立地磁学、地球物理学和高空气象学馆。
