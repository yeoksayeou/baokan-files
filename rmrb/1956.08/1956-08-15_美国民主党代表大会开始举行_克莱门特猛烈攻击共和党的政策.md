Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, August 14th: The U.S. Democratic National Convention, planning for the election campaign, opened in Chicago on August 13th.

    At the opening session, Tennessee Governor Clement delivered a keynote speech on behalf of the Democratic Party leadership.

    Clement accused the Republican cabinet of being a "cabinet of millionaires," which had brought disaster to farmers, workers, and small business owners, while benefiting large corporations. He denounced the Republicans for "embezzling" and "rampant greed," and said that the Republican's four years in office in domestic affairs was a "despicable history of broken promises and discord."

    In his speech attacking the Republicans, Clement also accused the current government of pursuing "a ridiculous, arrogant, and deadly foreign policy," which was "drifting" and "short-sighted," causing the United States to reach "an unprecedented low in the eyes of all countries in the world," while allowing the Soviet Union to achieve "major diplomatic victories" in Asia and elsewhere. He called Nixon "the Republican's second-in-command" and Dulles "undoubtedly the biggest uncontrolled missile in American diplomatic history."

    Clement particularly attacked the Republican government regarding developments in the Middle East and Far East. This Democrat believed that the developments in the Middle East had placed the United States in an "embarrassing position." He criticized the Republican government's attempt to diminish the significance of the Suez Canal issue, arguing that it was an "event that could conceivably cost the lives of American men and lead the United States into a final world war."

    The news said that this year's Democratic National Convention, originally expected to be relatively calm, may face heated disputes due to the development of two events.

    The first event is former President Truman's sudden announcement of support for New York Governor Harriman as the Democratic presidential candidate. Due to Truman's influence within the Democratic Party, this decision has led to a rapid increase in votes supporting Harriman. Some predict that a stalemate may ultimately form between Stevenson and Harriman. However, some also believe that Stevenson still has a chance of winning.

    Another issue that may plunge the Democratic Party into disputes is the issue of civil rights. Although the Democratic platform committee meeting has ended several days ago, due to the differences between the Southern and Northern Democrats in the group that participated in drafting the platform on the issue of black civil rights, a platform has not yet been drafted on this issue.

### 美国民主党代表大会开始举行  克莱门特猛烈攻击共和党的政策

    美国民主党代表大会开始举行
    克莱门特猛烈攻击共和党的政策
    据新华社14日讯　芝加哥消息：筹划竞选工作的美国民主党代表大会八月十三日在芝加哥开幕。
    在开幕会议上，田纳西州州长克莱门特代表民主党首脑部作了名为主要发言的演说。
    克莱门特指责共和党内阁是“百万富翁的内阁”，这个内阁给农民、工人、小企业家带来了灾难，而使大公司得到了好处。他骂共和党“巧取豪夺”和“贪婪成风”，共和党在内政方面四年的执政史是“背弃诺言的卑鄙龉龊的历史”。
    克莱门特在他攻击共和党的演说里还指责现政府执行“一种荒唐、狂妄、而致命的外交政策”，这种政策“漂流不定”和“目光短浅”，它使美国“在全世界各国中的地位到达空前低落的地步”，而使苏联在亚洲和其他地方取得“重大的外交胜利”。他说尼克松是“共和党的二头目”，说杜勒斯“无疑是美国外交史上最大的一颗无定向导弹”。
    克莱门特特别就中东和远东地区事态的发展攻击共和党政府。这个民主党人认为中东的事态发展使美国处在“难堪的地位”。他抨击共和党政府企图缩小苏彝士运河问题的意义，而认为这是一个“可以想像得到将会耗费美国男儿的生命和把美国引入最后的世界大战的事件”。
    消息说，原来被认为会是较为平静的今年民主党代表大会，已经因为两个事件的发展而有可能发生激烈的争吵。
    第一个事件是前总统杜鲁门突然宣布支持纽约州州长哈里曼为民主党总统候选人。由于杜鲁门在民主党内的影响，这个决定使支持哈里曼的票迅速增加。有人预料史蒂文森和哈里曼之间最后可能形成僵局。但是，也有人认为史蒂文森仍然有机会获胜。
    另一个可能使民主党陷入争吵的问题是公民权利问题。民主党政纲委员会会议虽然已经结束几天，但是由于参加拟订政纲的小组的南部和北部民主党人在黑人公民权利问题上的分歧，迄今在这个问题上还没有能够拟订出一条纲领。
