    Rescue
    Liu Jibin
    At midnight on August 6th, the Yongding River North Embankment in Mag 각zhuang, Daxing County, Hebei Province, suddenly breached. The floodwaters rushed out of the embankment fiercely, engulfing crops, knocking down trees, and surrounding Dongmag 각zhuang, Zhao 각zhuang, and Zhoujiachang. Inside and outside the villages, it immediately became a vast expanse of water.
    At this moment, a certain armored regiment rushed from a hundred miles away to rescue. They immediately divided into two teams and swam into the villages surrounded by floodwaters. One team, led by Captain Song Chaoguang, cooperated with local rescue personnel to transport the masses in two large wooden boats. The other team, led by Captain Zhang Xiaoying, selected over a hundred officers and soldiers familiar with water and formed more than thirty wooden rafts with doors and wooden ladders, shuttling back and forth in the floodwaters to rescue people.
    Officers and Communist Party members, dragging the rafts, ran around in the villages where the water was waist-deep, sometimes being knocked down by the water, sometimes being scratched by tree branches and crop stubble. But no one made a sound. Platoon Leader Fan Liqi of the Seventh Company, leading the rescue team, when rescuing farmers in Dongmag 각zhuang, because the rafts were small and there were many people, the rafts took on water. They were afraid that the elderly and children would get sick from soaking in the water, so they carried the rafts.
    After the river embankment breached, there was a main stream passing between Dongmag 각zhuang and Ximag 각zhuang. In a place about dozens of meters wide, the water was deep and the current was rapid, and rafts and people were often knocked down when passing through here. In order to protect the safety of the farmers, Captain Bu Shifeng led dozens of officers and soldiers to form a "human wall" in this rapid current. They connected some large ropes together, tied them to a row of trees, and then lined up side by side, tightly grasping the ropes, shoulder to shoulder, to block the floodwaters, preventing the floodwaters from rushing straight through. Soldiers Zhao Jiawu, Yu Zhikuan, Chen Wentong, and Zhang Zesheng were responsible for the central section of the entire "human wall," where the water was over their heads and the current was rapid. They disregarded the danger, shuttling back and forth in this rapid current, swimming while protecting the rafts and people to pass safely. They fought in the water for a full six hours.
    At the same time, the officers and soldiers carried many elderly people, children, and patients out of the villages. Li Dexiang, a new recruit who had just joined the army this year, carried people six times in one afternoon, traveling no less than twenty li back and forth. On one occasion, he gritted his teeth and rescued three people, carrying and supporting them. An old lady, seventy-eight years old, in Dongmag 각zhuang, saw the troops coming to rescue her and said with tears in her eyes, "The People's Liberation Army is truly irreplaceable; they still come to save us in such a big flood!"
    After a day of rescue, more than two hundred farmers escaped danger with the help of the troops, and thousands of people received assistance from the troops in their escape.

    抢救
    刘纪斌
    八月六日午夜，河北省大兴县麻各庄永定河北堤突然决口了。洪水向堤外凶猛地奔泻，吞噬了庄稼，冲倒了树木，包围了东西麻各庄、赵各庄、周家场。村里村外，立时泛成一片汪洋。
    正在这当儿，装甲兵某团由一百里外赶来抢救。他们马上分作两队泅入洪水包围的村庄。其中一队由大尉宋超广率领，协同地方抢救人员，用两只大木船载运群众。另一队由大尉张校英率领，挑选出一百多名熟悉水性的官兵组成抢救突击队，用门板、木梯结成三十多个木筏，在洪水里往返抢救。
    军官和共产党员们一面拖着木筏，在水深齐腰的村庄附近跑来跑去，有时被水冲倒了，有时被树杈、庄稼楂扎伤了。可是谁也不啃声。七连排长范立起所带领的抢救组，在抢救东麻各庄的农民的时候，因为筏子小、人多，筏子上了水，他们怕老年人、小孩浸水生病，便抬着筏子走。
    在河堤决口以后，东西麻各庄之间有一条主流穿过。约宽几十公尺的地方，水深流急，木筏子和人在这里通过经常被冲倒。为了保护农民的安全，上尉步世锋率领几十名官兵在这段急流中结成了一堵“人墙”。他们把一些大绳连接在一起，拴到一排树上，然后一字排开，紧紧抓住绳子，肩并肩地阻挡洪水，不使洪水横冲直撞。士兵赵家武、于志宽、陈文通、张泽生四人所负责的一段是整个“人墙”的中心，那儿水深没顶，水流急速，他们不顾危险，来回穿梭在这段急流之间，一边游着，一边保护木筏和人安全通过。就这样，足足在水中搏斗了六个小时。
    在此同时，官兵们从村庄里背出许多老年人、小孩和病人。今年刚入伍的新兵李德祥，在一个下午就背了六趟，往返不下二十里。其中有一次他咬紧牙关，连背带架抢救出三人。东麻各庄的一个七十八岁的老大娘，看到部队去救她，感动地流着眼泪说：“解放军真是天下没处找，这么大水还来救咱们！”
    经过一天的抢救，有二百多农民在部队抢救下脱险，有成千的群众在脱险中得到了部队的帮助。
