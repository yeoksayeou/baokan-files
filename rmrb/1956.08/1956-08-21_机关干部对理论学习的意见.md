Editor's Note: The article "Reflections on the Political Economy Exam," published in this newspaper on August 2nd, has aroused great repercussions and resonance among government cadres. We have received many letters reflecting the overly tense state of various government organs in preparing for theoretical study exams, and raising various questions and suggestions regarding theoretical study exams. We believe that these questions and suggestions are worth referring to and studying by the relevant government organs and departments guiding theoretical study. The following are excerpts from several letters.

It is best to use essay writing as the exam method
Editor:
Two months ago, our organization conducted a political economy exam. Although everyone prepared very nervously and seriously beforehand, even holding a "Political Economy" textbook on the bus and while defecating, either reciting the "law of surplus value" or chanting the "basic economic law." However, the result of the exam was that even those comrades who usually studied well only got a "general" score.

How to explain it? I think it is best to use a comrade's words to illustrate: "If I had known it would be tested with 'true or false' and 'fill in the blanks', I would have memorized a few more rules!" "If I had known that points would be deducted for wrong answers, I would have simply not answered!" I think the purpose of such an exam will inevitably lead comrades to "memorize books rigidly, study books rigidly, and die from books!"

If studying theory is for connecting with practical work and solving practical problems, why can't we use methods such as writing study心得 (xīndé - reflections, insights) and writing papers to test the learning results of students? In this way, students will naturally not desperately memorize those articles and formulas, but will use their brains and use what they have learned to analyze problems and observe problems in connection with their actual work. Moreover, it can also avoid the excessive mental burden of being overly nervous about the exam.

This Examination Method Is Unreasonable
Editor:
According to regulations, the political economy textbook is to be completed in two and a half years. We finished the first 21 chapters in the first half of this year, and started preparing for the exam review on July 15th. We feel that the progress is too fast.

Now everyone is preparing for the October exam, and they are very nervous. Because more than forty review questions have been issued. It is also stipulated that the exam results will be included in the personnel file materials. Everyone believes that this is the basis for appraisal and promotion, which makes everyone even more nervous. Many people no longer study professional subjects, and some people even stop reading newspapers, often working late into the night, so that they are not in good spirits during the day. In particular, older comrades and comrades with many children find it more difficult to review. The mental burden is even greater.

I think this exam method that does not take into account the energy and work of the comrades is inappropriate. I suggest that cadre theoretical study should not adopt this exam method, but should adopt the method of issuing homework questions after each chapter or two chapters are completed for review and testing.

At the same time, we should take into account the special circumstances of some cadres' work and health, and should not demand uniformity, and should not one-sidedly emphasize exam results, so as not to cause excessive burden and excessive tension on the cadres' spirits.

How Should We Review After All
Editor:
We finished listening to the lectures on Chapter 7 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on July 25th, and we will have an exam at the end of August.

The general review questions sent down by the higher authority have a total of forty-five (not including sub-questions). Among them, there are nine major questions that are the first key questions. These nine major key questions include a total of twenty-seven sub-questions; there are sixteen second key questions, which include six sub-questions; the rest are ordinary questions. But the group leader said that these three types of questions will be asked in the exam, meaning that all review questions must be prepared. I spent a week, about thirty hours, to get a general idea of the first and second key questions in the introduction and the first to second chapters. How can we review so many questions well in just five weeks?

Some people criticize us: Why do you review like this? Just understand and remember the general idea, you don't have to rigidly memorize the articles. We naturally agree with their saying, but some questions must be memorized. If you miss one item in the answer, it is considered incomplete, and it is even more impossible to answer questions with your own understanding. Rigidly memorizing the articles is not good, and not rigidly memorizing the articles is not good either, and time is pressing, and the exam is coming soon, what should we do?

### 机关干部对理论学习的意见

    机关干部对理论学习的意见
    编者按　本报八月二日刊登的“政治经济学考试有感”一文，在机关干部中引起很大的反响和共鸣。先后收到很多来信反映各个机关在准备理论学习考试中过分紧张的状态，并提出有关理论学习考试的各种问题和建议。我们认为这些问题和建议是值得有关机关和指导理论学习的部门参考研究的。下面就是几封来信的摘录。
    最好用写论文的方式考试编辑同志：
    两个月前，我们机关组织了一次政治经济学考试。尽管事前大家都作了很紧张很认真的准备，甚至坐公共汽车、解大便也捧着一本“政治经济学”，不是背什么“剩余价值规律”，就是诵“基本经济规律”。然而考试的结果，连那些平时学习很好的同志，也只得了一个“一般”的分数。
    怎样解释呢？我想还是举一个同志的话来说明吧：“早知这样考‘是非’和‘填空’，那我多背几条规律就好了！”“早知答错了要扣分，那我索性不答好了！”我想这样的考试目的，不引导同志们去“背死书、死读书、读书死”才怪呢！
    如果说学习理论是为了联系实际工作。解决实际问题的话，为什么不可以采取写学习心得和写论文之类的方式来测验学员们的学习成果呢？这样的话，学员自然就不会拚命死背那些条文公式，而会动动脑筋，运用学习的东西，联系自己的实际工作来分析问题和观察问题了。而且还可以避免那种为考试而考试的过分紧张的精神负担。
                          俊　民
    这种考试办法不合理编辑同志：
    按规定，政治经济学教科书是两年半学完，我们在本年上半年就学完了上册二十一章，自七月十五日起开始准备考试复习。我们感觉进度太快了。
    现在大家正准备十月初的考试，都十分紧张。因为共出了四十多个复习题。而且还规定把考试成绩列入人事档案材料。大家认为这是鉴定和提拔的根据，因此使得大家更紧张了。有不少人业务学习也不学了，有的人连报纸也不看了，常常开夜车，以致白天工作时精神不好。特别是年纪大的同志和子女多的同志，复习更感困难。精神负担也就更大。
    我认为这种不照顾同志们的精力和工作的考试办法是不妥当的。我建议干部理论学习不要采取这种考试办法，而采取每学完一章或两章之后，出作业题，来进行复习和测验的办法。
    同时应该照顾到一些干部工作和身体的特殊情况，不要强求一律，不要片面地强调考试成绩，以致给干部精神上造成过重的负担和过分的紧张。　魏　之
      究竟应该怎样复习编辑同志：
    我们七月二十五日听完了联共党史第七章的讲课，八月底就要考试了。
    上面发下来的总复习题共有四十五个（还不包括小题）。其中有九个大题是第一重点题，在这九大重点题内共包括二十七个小题；有十六个第二重点题，其中包括六个小题；其余的是普通的。但小组长说，考试的时候，这三种题都要出，意思就是凡是复习题都要准备。我利用了一个星期，大约三十多小时才把导言和第一到第二章的第一、第二重点题看了个概要。仅仅五个星期的时间，怎么能把这么多的题复习好呢？
    有人批评我们：你们为什么这样复习，看懂记个大概就行了，不必死背条文。我们自然同意他们的说法，可是有些题目非要背不可。答题时少一条也算不完全，用自己的理解来答问题更不行了。死背条文不好，不死背条文也不行，而且时间逼人，眼看考期就到，这该如何是好呢？　民史
