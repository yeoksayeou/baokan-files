    Talking About Being Busy
    Yu Yi
    Comrade Yu Jin, in his short article called "Busy," said in a lecturing tone: "'Busy' talk is useless; one must work honestly and diligently. All those who say they are 'busy,' please show some real work achievements!"
    Comrade Yu Jin must know that everyone who has a job today is busy, right?
    Among the busy people, there are indeed many who say "busy," for example, labor models are busy attending meetings, busy with social activities, busy giving reports, unable to "work honestly and diligently" at their posts; students have excessive burdens and often cannot rest even on Sundays, with over 10% of middle school students in some areas suffering from tuberculosis, high blood pressure, and neurasthenia; teachers have excessive burdens and also have to add extracurricular activities, making it impossible to improve their professional skills; writers do not have time to write calmly... These facts have already been mentioned at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, and have been pointed out many times in newspapers and periodicals. But we also have another kind of people who see things very simply, see life very simply, and see people very simply. When they hear people say "busy" or complain about "excessive burdens," they immediately think of "idling," "individualism," and "petty-bourgeois ideology," and feel they must give them a good clubbing.
    I hope Comrade Yu Jin is not the latter type of person, and I hope that the people he is criticizing in his short article are not the former type. Otherwise, labor models, teachers, writers, etc.... can ask him: Give us back our time so that we can "work honestly and diligently"!
    Can Comrade Yu Jin grant their request?
    They are saying "busy" precisely because they want to "show some real work achievements."

    说忙
    余一
    余今同志在那篇叫做“忙”的短文里用教训的口气说：“‘忙’的空话是没有用处的，必须老老实实地工作。一切说‘忙’的人，请拿出些真正的工作成绩吧！”
    余今同志一定知道今天凡是有工作的人没有一个不忙的事实吧。
    忙的人中间现在的确有不少说“忙”的人，譬如劳动模范开会忙，社会活动忙，做报告忙，不能在岗位上“老老实实地工作”；学生负担过重，常常在星期天也得不到休息，有些地区10％以上的中学生患肺结核、高血压和神经衰弱症；教师负担过重，还要加上校外活动，没法提高自己的业务水平；作家没有时间从容地写作……这些事实在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上已经有人提过，而且报刊上也已经指出过好多回了。但我们现在也还有另一种人，他们把事情看得非常单纯，把生活看得非常单纯，把人看得非常单纯。听见人说“忙”或者叫“负担过重”，立刻就想到“偷闲”，想到“个人主义”，想到“小资产阶级思想”，觉得非给以闷棍不可。
    希望余今同志不是后一种人，希望他在短文内所指责的不是前一种人。否则劳动模范、教师、作家等等……都可以向他要求：给还我们的时间，让我们“老老实实地工作”吧。
    余今同志能不能答应他们的要求呢？
    他们正是为了想“拿出些真正的工作成绩”，才说“忙”的。
