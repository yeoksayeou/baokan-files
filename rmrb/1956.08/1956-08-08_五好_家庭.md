    "Five-Good" Family
    Cao Baoming
    Since 1954, the Wuhan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation has been actively educating the families of workers to implement the "Five-Good" work, and establish harmonious and happy socialist families. The requirements of the "Five-Good" are mainly to plan the family life well, and on this basis, to encourage workers to produce well, unite and help each other well, maintain good hygiene, and study and educate their children well. The family of Li Chunpei, whom I visited, is such a "Five-Good" family.
    Li Chunpei's husband, Zhang Zhenduo, is the deputy director of the People's Bank district office, with a monthly salary of 91 yuan. Her family of three adults and five children all depend on this income, and her eldest child studying at a normal school and her mother-in-law in her hometown also need subsidies from here, so the burden is very heavy. However, because Li Chunpei plans her life well, the whole family lives well.
    How does Li Chunpei manage her life? She gave me an account of income and expenditure:
    "Zhenduo usually lives in the office. His food, pocket money, rent, remittances to his mother, etc., cost 41 yuan. The remaining 50 yuan is used to support the seven people in the family. After I receive this money on the 5th of each month, I first buy half a month's worth of rice, coal, and daily necessities. The daily vegetable money does not exceed 3 jiao, and I buy some nutritious, economical, and delicious sweet potatoes, tofu, etc. When everyone gathers on Sundays, I spend more than one yuan on vegetables and make some good dishes for everyone to eat. In this way, the monthly food and pocket money do not exceed 45 yuan, and I can still save 5 yuan to supplement shoes and clothes. Although we have no savings, we have never borrowed money."
    "What if there is some illness or other unexpected event?"
    "We pay attention to nutrition and hygiene while saving money. The adults and children are all in good health, and they have not had any serious illnesses in recent years. Even if there are difficulties, we find ways to overcome them. In the spring of 1952, when I was expecting my fifth child, it was the height of the ‘Three-Anti’ campaign, and Zhenduo was very busy at work and couldn't spare time to come home. When Zhenduo saw that there was no one to take care of the family, he wanted to hire someone, but there was not enough money. I said to him, 'Leave the family matters to me. You don't have to worry, just concentrate on your work!' At that time, the eldest child was thirteen years old and was at home on winter vacation. After I gave birth, he did some housework, and the second and third children also automatically helped their older brother. The three of them divided the work. The eldest was responsible for cooking and taking care of his mother; the second was responsible for going to the street to buy things and doing some odd jobs; the third wiped the table and made the bed. In this way, we overcame the difficulties."
    "How is the organization taking care of you?"
    "There is a lot of care. Just in the second half of last year, the bank said that our family had a large population and gave us a subsidy of nine yuan per month. In March of this year, we calculated that we could do without the subsidy, so we requested to stop the subsidy to us.
    "With the family life arranged well, Zhenduo can concentrate on his work. He has not taken a day off for any family matters in recent years, and has even won two awards. The three eldest children are all Young Pioneers, and the eldest and third children's academic performance is above 80 points. I myself have also participated in street work, and have been elected as a people's representative of Jiang'an District and a Wuhan Municipal Grade B Labor Model, and am now striving to join the Party."
    Families like Li Chunpei's were not common in Wuhan in the past. However, after the Women's Federation and the Trade Union actively educated the families of workers on establishing "Five-Good" families, now, there are more than 15,000 "Five-Good" activists in the city, and more than 78,000 families of workers are actively implementing the "Five-Good".

### “五好”家庭

    “五好”家庭
    曹葆铭
    武汉市民主妇女联合会，自1954年起便积极教育职工家属贯彻“五好”工作，建立和睦幸福的社会主义家庭。“五好”的要求主要是把家庭的日子计划好，并在这个基础上作到鼓励职工生产好、团结互助好、卫生好、学习和教育子女好。我所访问的李春培的家庭，便是这样一个“五好”家庭。
    李春培的丈夫张振铎是人民银行区办事处副主任，每月工资收入九十一元，她家三个大人、五个孩子全靠这笔收入生活，她的在师范学校念书的大孩子和在家乡的婆母也需要这里补贴，所以负担很重。但是，因为李春培过日子有计划，全家生活还好。
    李春培是怎样过日子的呢？她向我算了笔收支账：
    “振铎平时住在机关里，他的伙食、零用加上房租，寄给婆母等等共需四十一元，剩下五十元供家里七个人生活，我每月五日领了这笔钱后，便先买好半个月的米、煤日用品。每天的菜钱不超过三角，买些又有营养、又节约、又好吃的洋苕、豆腐等。星期天大家聚齐了，便花一元多菜钱，作些好菜大家吃。这样，一月的伙食和零用不超过四十五元，还能剩下五元来添补鞋子、衣服。我们虽没有节余，但也没有借过债。”
    “万一有点病痛或其他意外事情怎么办呢？”
    “我们在节约中还注意营养、卫生，大人、孩子的身体都还好，几年来都没生过什么病。就是有了困难，我们也想办法克服。1952年春天，我添第五个孩子，那时正是
  ‘三反’高潮，振铎在行里工作很忙，顾不上回家。振铎看到家里没人招呼，想雇个人，可是钱又不够。我就跟他说：‘家里的事有我，你不用耽心，还是安心工作！’那时候，大孩子十三岁了，放寒假在家里。我生产后，他就作点家务事，老二、老三看到了也自动帮助哥哥做事。他们三个还分了工，老大负责作饭和招呼妈妈；老二负责上街买东西和作些零碎事；老三抹桌子、叠床。就这样，我们克服了困难。”
    “组织上对你们的照顾怎样？”
    “照顾是很多的，就在去年下半年，行里还说我家人口多，每月给我们九元补助费。今年三月，我们算了一下可以不要补助，我们便请求停止对我们的补助。
    “家庭生活安排好了，振铎便能安心工作，几年来都没有为家里的任何事情请过一天假，还得过两次奖。三个大孩子都是少年先锋队员，老大、老三的学习成绩都在八十分以上。我自己也参加了街道工作，还被选为江岸区的人民代表、武汉市乙等劳动模范，现在正争取入党。”
    像李春培这样的家庭，过去在武汉市并不多。但是，当妇联和工会积极向职工家属进行建立“五好”家庭的教育以后，现在，全市已有一万五千多名“五好”积极分子，还有七万八千多名职工家属正在积极贯彻“五好”。
