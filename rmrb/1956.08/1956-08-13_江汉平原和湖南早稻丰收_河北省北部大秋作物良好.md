Xinhua News Agency, Jiangling, 12th – On the evening of the 9th, the CPC Jingzhou Prefectural Committee of Hubei Province, together with the county committees and the prefectural and county agricultural and financial departments, held a telephone conference to organize the autumn harvest work, welcoming the first autumn harvest after the realization of agricultural cooperation in the Jianghan Plain.

This year, the Jianghan Plain is experiencing a good year of "favorable weather, abundant harvests."  The early rice has just been harvested, and the harvesting of middle rice has already begun. According to the person in charge of the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee: of the more than 10 million mu of rice in Jingzhou Prefecture, except for some areas where the japonica rice promoted this year experienced a slight decrease in production due to lack of experience, the early and middle rice generally achieved a bumper harvest, with an increase of about 20% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th – More than 14 million mu of early rice in Hunan Province has been completely harvested. This year, early rice has generally achieved a bumper harvest, with the average yield per mu reaching more than 400 jin, an increase of 10% compared to last year, which was also a year of good early rice harvest.

In the province's main grain and double-cropping rice producing areas – the Dongting Lake Plain and the Xiangjiang River Basin – the average yield of early rice per mu in agricultural cooperatives is generally 450 to 500 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 12th – The more than 20 million mu of autumn crops in Tangshan, Chengde, Zhangjiakou and other prefectures, the main grain-producing areas in northern Hebei Province, are growing well. The millet has formed full ears and is now flowering and filling. The corn stalks are thick and sturdy, already seven or eight chi tall, with two or three ears per plant. Beneath the dense peanut leaves, clusters of golden yellow flowers are blooming.  A few randomly dug up sweet potatoes show that each plant has tubers weighing about one jin. According to preliminary estimates by the agricultural departments of Chengde Prefecture, this year's autumn harvest could be 90% or better of a normal year.

Currently, the broad masses of commune members in these areas are actively taking various measures to strengthen the late-stage management of crops, striving to increase grain production.

    江汉平原和湖南早稻丰收
    河北省北部大秋作物良好
    据新华社江陵12日电　九日晚上，中共湖北省荆州地委会同各县委以及专、县农业、财经等部门举行组织秋收工作的电话会议，迎接江汉平原实现农业合作化后第一次的秋收。
    今年江汉平原是“风调雨顺，五谷丰登”的好年景，早稻刚收完，又开始收割中稻了。据荆州地委负责人谈：荆州专区一千多万亩水稻，除了部分地区今年推广的粳稻由于缺少经验稍有减产外，早、中稻普遍获得丰收，比去年增产两成左右。
    据新华社长沙12日电　湖南省一千四百多万亩早稻全部收割完毕。今年早稻普遍获得丰收，全省平均单位面积产量达四百多斤，比早稻丰收的去年还要增产一成。
    这个省的粮食和双季稻主要产区——洞庭湖滨平原和湘江流域的各农业社，早稻平均每亩产量一般都有四百五十斤到五百斤。
    据新华社保定12日电　河北省北部主要粮产区唐山、承德、张家口等专区的二千多万亩大秋作物生长良好，谷子已经秀齐了穗，正在开花灌粒。玉米秸秆粗壮，已有七、八尺高，每棵长了两三个穗。茂密的花生叶下，盛开着密集的金黄色小花。春播的甘薯，挖出几棵看看，每棵均有一斤左右的块根。据承德专区农业部门初步估计，今年秋收可获九成以上的年景。
    目前，这些地区的广大社员们，正积极采取各种措施加强农作物的后期管理，争取增产更多的粮食。
