Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 23rd: After correcting the tendency of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sidelines, some agricultural production cooperatives in Jilin Province have been operating sideline production year-round and receiving income in all seasons, changing the conventional practice of annual harvest and one-time distribution in northern rural areas.

The western part of this province is a vast grassland, the central part has rivers, and the eastern part is the Changbai Mountain area, rich in products. Many agricultural cooperatives living in these areas, under the policy of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, and relying on the water to eat the water," operate a variety of sideline businesses. They hunt, fish, collect medicinal herbs, raise bees, and engage in animal husbandry, as well as wood industry, iron industry, flour mills, transportation and other production; cooperative members' families also raise many chickens, ducks, and hairy pigs.

These agricultural cooperatives have income in all seasons due to the year-round operation of sideline production. The sideline income of agricultural cooperatives in five counties of Tonghua Prefecture from spring to summer totaled more than 1.18 million yuan. From spring to August, the sideline income of 280 agricultural cooperatives in Dongliao County reached more than 388,000 yuan, more than double the same period last year.

These agricultural cooperatives also promptly handled the sideline income, in addition to using a part of it as production funds, the rest was pre-distributed to the members on a monthly or quarterly basis, promptly solving the livelihood difficulties of the members. In Renming Agricultural Cooperative, Helong County, 83 cooperative member households who could not afford to raise pigs in the past have now bought piglets with sideline dividends, and the number of pigs raised in the entire cooperative has reached an average of three per household.

    常年经营副业　四季都有收益
    吉林有些农业社改变年收一季分配一次的常规
    新华社长春23日电　吉林省有些农业生产合作社在纠正了重农业轻副业的偏向后，常年经营副业生产，四季都有收益，改变了北方农村年收一季和分配一次的常规。
    这个省西部是广阔的草原，中部有江有河，东部是物产丰富的长白山区。住在这些地区的许多农业社，在“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的方针下，经营的副业是多种多样的，它们打猎、捕鱼、采药、养蜂、经营畜牧业，也从事木业、铁业、粉坊、运输等生产；社员家庭还养了不少鸡、鸭和毛猪。
    这些农业社在常年经营副业生产的情况下，一年四季都有收入。通化专区五个县的农业社由春到夏副业收入共达一百一十八万多元。东辽县的二百八十个农业社从春到八月副业收入达到三十八万八千多元，比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    这些农业社还及时地处理了副业收益，除把一部分当作生产资金外，其余的都按月、按季预分给社员，及时地解决了社员的生活困难。和龙县仁明农业社过去养不起猪的八十三户社员，现在都用副业分红买了小猪，全社的养猪数量平均每户达到了三口。
