		Youth Drilling Team
	The Li Shishun Youth Advanced Drilling Team of the Karamay Oilfield completed four exploratory wells in eighty-nine days without any major accidents, setting a new record for long-term, rapid, and safe drilling. Now, all four completed exploratory wells have produced crude oil, and the fifth well began installation on the 18th.
	The Li Shishun Drilling Team was transferred from the Dushanzi Mining Area in March of this year. The first exploratory well they drilled in Karamay yielded a large amount of crude oil. Subsequently, the exploration area leaders organized them to carry out rapid drilling. On the first day, they drilled 205 meters in ten hours and five minutes, setting the highest daily footage record for Soviet drilling rigs in Xinjiang.
	After June, the temperature on the Gobi Desert rose to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the supply of water for drilling and daily life could not meet the demand. The drilling team experienced several interruptions in drinking water. Sometimes, they were so thirsty that they could not speak, but they endured the thirst and persisted in drilling. When drilling the third exploratory well, the daily rate reached over 600 meters, an increase of more than 200 meters compared to the first exploratory well.
	During the drilling of these four exploratory wells, they also saved the country more than 200 meters of casing and more than 50 tons of barite. Their experience in rapid and safe drilling is now being promoted in various drilling teams. (Xinhua News Agency)
		Active Mobile Postal Service Station
	In the Karamay exploration area, a white tent can often be seen. Hundreds of people enter and exit from there every day, some to send letters and remittances, and others to buy newspapers and magazines. This tent is the mobile service station of the newly established Karamay Postal and Telecommunications Branch.
	In the past, there was only one postal and telecommunications branch in the central area within a 200-kilometer radius of the exploration area. People often had to travel dozens or even 200 kilometers to send and receive mail and packages. After the mobile service station was established, it frequently moved to drilling teams and work sections, and to areas such as Zhong-, Xiao-Guai, North Karamay, and Urho, delivering letters and remittances, sending telegrams, and selling new magazines for the comrades. When the mobile service station arrived in an area, the staff in that area would provide them with accommodation, give them new quilts, and cook eggs for them. One cook had been transferred several times, and had not received the items sent to him by his family for a long time. He wrote his name on the sand with his finger. Soon, the post office promptly forwarded the undeliverable package to him. (He Ang)
		Telephone Line Repaired
	The 158-kilometer-long telephone line from the Karamay Oilfield to the Dushanzi Mining Area was installed and put into operation on the 18th. More than 400 kilometers of the more than 870 kilometers of telephone lines between Karamay and Urho, and between these two places and various drilling teams, have also been erected.
	In the past, communication between Karamay and the Dushanzi Mining Area, as well as the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, the leading organization located in Urumqi, relied on telegrams, which were slow and inconvenient. With the completion of the telephone line from Karamay to the Dushanzi Mining Area, telephones can now be used at any time. Most of the drilling teams, scattered over an area of hundreds of square kilometers, now have telephone equipment.
	Currently, telephone line installation workers are actively erecting the remaining exploration area lines in the hot Gobi Desert. (Xinhua News Agency)
		Workers Move into New Homes
	The first batch of residential buildings in Karamay has been completed. Row upon row of pink brick houses adorn the Gobi Desert, making it more beautiful.
	On August 5th, these houses welcomed their new owners—the workers of the drilling teams.
	At this time last year, when the first batch of drilling workers arrived here, there were only scattered tents and a wooden house on the Gobi Desert. In just one year, they have witnessed the erection of villa-style houses in the place they have worked so hard to develop. What a rapid change!
	The soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps built these houses. They once used their hardworking hands to build factories and dormitories in the Dushanzi Mining Area. Today, they are building beautiful homes for the oil workers.
	This year, the construction area in the Karamay oil area reaches more than 50,000 square meters. By the beginning of August, 76 buildings have been under construction, and 16 residential buildings have been completed. While building dormitories, the soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps are also accelerating the construction of tractor stations, automobile repair and maintenance plants, construction machinery stations, and mud testing laboratories. When winter comes to the oil area, Karamay will have another new look.

		Valuable Gifts
	On the 23rd, the employees of the Karamay Oilfield received a batch of valuable gifts. These gifts included a movie projector, a complete set of musical instruments (violins, accordions, erhus, flutes, yangqins, etc.) and a screen needed to organize a cultural troupe, as well as volleyballs, billiards, badminton rackets, chess sets, military flags, etc., for the sports and recreational activities of employees of all ethnic groups. There was also a large number of reading materials printed in various ethnic languages.
	These gifts, worth more than 11,000 yuan, were donated by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions. In a letter to all the employees of Karamay, the Federation of Trade Unions said: "In your labor in developing the Karamay Oilfield, you have demonstrated the noble qualities of the working class, who are not afraid of hardship and difficulty. The gifts we give you may not be much, but they express our condolences and support for you."

    来自克拉玛依的消息
        青年钻井队
    克拉玛依油田李世顺青年先进钻井队八十九天钻成四日探井，并且没有发生任何重大事故，创造了长期快速安全钻进的新纪录。现在，已经钻成的四口探井都喷出了原油，第五口探井在18日已经开始安装。
    李世顺钻井队是今年3月从独山子矿区调来的。他们来到克拉玛依钻成的第一口探井就喷出了大量原油。接着探区领导上组织他们开展快速钻进，第一天，他们就在十小时零五分钟内钻进了二百零五公尺，创造了新疆波乌钻机日进尺的最高纪录。
    6月份以后，戈壁上的气温上升到华氏一百多度，钻井和生活用水供不应求。这个钻井队曾几次断绝饮水，有时大家渴得不能说话了，但他们忍受着干渴仍然坚持钻井。在钻第三口探井的时候，日速达到六百多公尺，比钻第一口探井提高了二百多公尺。
    他们在钻凿这四口探井期间，还为国家节省了二百多公尺套管，五十多吨重晶石。现在他们快速和安全钻进的经验，已经在各钻井队推广。　（新华社讯）
    活跃的邮电流动服务站
    在克拉玛依探区，经常可以看到一座白色的帐篷，在帐篷的门口，每天有几百个人从那里进出，有的是寄信和汇钱，也有的是买报纸和杂志，这座帐篷就是成立不久的克拉玛依邮电支局的流动服务站。
    过去在探区周围二百公里内，只有中心区有一个邮电支局，人们要寄取邮件包裹，往往要跑几十公里到二百公里。流动服务站成立了以后，经常流动到井队和工段，流动到中、小拐、北克拉玛依、乌尔禾等地区，替同志们带信汇钱，代打电报，出售新杂志。当流动服务站到达那个地区的时候，在那个地区的工作人员就留他们住宿，拿新被子给他们盖，煮鸡蛋给他们吃。有一位炊事员同志工作调动了几次，家中寄给他的东西，许久没有收到。他用手指在沙地上写了姓名。不久，邮局就把这个无法投递的包裹及时转给他了。　　（贺　昂）
        电话修通了
    克拉玛依油田通往独山子矿区的一百五十八公里长的电话线路，在18日安装完毕开始通话。克拉玛依—乌尔禾之间以及这两个地方通往各井队的另外八百七十多公里电话线路，也架设了四百多公里。
    克拉玛依过去和独山子矿区以及设在乌鲁木齐的领导机构——新疆石油管理局的通讯联络，都是靠电报联系，电报往来迟缓，很不方便。克拉玛依到独山子矿区的电话线路修通以后，就可以随时利用电话了。现在分散在数百平方公里面积上的井队，绝大部分都有了电话设备。
    目前，电话线路安装工人正在炎热的戈壁上，积极架设还没完成的探区线路架设工程。

      工人们搬进了新居
    克拉玛依的第一批住宅落成了。一幢一幢的粉红色的砖房，把戈壁点缀得美丽起来了。
    8月5日，这批住宅迎接了新来的主人——钻井队的工人们。
    去年这个时候，当第一批钻井工人来到这里的时候，戈壁上只有疏疏落落的帐篷和一栋木头房，仅仅一年，他们亲眼见到在他们艰苦经营的地方，耸立起别墅式的房屋，这种变化是来得多么快啊！
    承建这批住宅的是生产建设部队的战士们。他们曾经用勤劳的手，修建了独山子矿区的厂房和宿舍。今天，他们又给石油工人们建造漂亮的家了。
    今年克拉玛依油区的建筑面积达五万多平方公尺，到8月上旬，先后有七十六栋施工了，目前完工的住宅有十六栋。和修建宿舍同时，生产建设部队的战士们正在加速修建拖拉机站、汽车修理保养厂、建筑机械站和泥浆试验室等厂房。当油区的冬天来到的时候，克拉玛依又将出现另一种新景色了。

        贵重的礼物
    克拉玛依油田职工在23日接到一批贵重的礼物。这些礼物中有电影放映机一部，有可供组织一个文工团需要的小提琴、手风琴、二胡、笛子、打琴等全套乐器和幕布，还有供各族职工作体育和文娱活动用的排球、康乐球、板羽球、象棋、军旗等，另外还有一大批用各民族文字印成的读物。
    这批价值一万一千多元的礼物是新疆维吾尔自治区工会联合会赠送的。工会联合会在写给克拉玛依全体职工的一封信中说：“你们在开发克拉玛依油田的劳动中，表现了工人阶级不怕艰苦、不畏困难的高贵品质。我们赠送给你们的礼物虽然不多，但表达了我们对你们的慰问和支援。”
