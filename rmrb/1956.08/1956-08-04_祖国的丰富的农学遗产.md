    The Rich Agricultural Heritage of the Motherland
    Wan Guoding, Director of the Chinese Agricultural Heritage Research Office

    Our motherland has a rich agricultural heritage. However, the level of agricultural science in our country is still relatively low. Due to the development of the socialist transformation of agriculture, our agricultural science has fallen far behind actual needs. Furthermore, because world agricultural science is advancing rapidly, our agricultural science should not stagnate. Therefore, in order to build socialism and improve the level of agricultural science, we must learn from the advanced agricultural science of foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union. However, agriculture is local, so we must oppose the tendency of dogmatism in our learning. We should pay attention to the characteristics of our own country. Our country is one of the ancient countries in the world, with the largest population, and has always been known for its diligence. Therefore, throughout history, our working people have accumulated very brilliant achievements and experiences in the struggle for agricultural production. These achievements and experiences accumulated by our working people in the struggle for agricultural production throughout history are valuable pointers for us in combining theory with practice. We must cherish this heritage and earnestly organize, study, and develop it.
    As early as the Warring States period, we already had specialized agricultural books, but unfortunately they have been lost, and only some fragments are now preserved. However, from these fragments, we can also see that as early as 2,200 years ago, agricultural science in our country had reached a fairly high level. For example, in the "Lüshi Chunqiu" "Dian Tu Pian," the sowing of crops was already studied in a relatively profound way. Also, the "Guanzi" "Di Yuan Pian" distinguishes soil types in detail, and the "Yu Gong" records the distribution of different soils throughout the country, which can generally conform to the facts.
    There were more than a dozen agricultural books in the Han Dynasty, of which "Fan Shengzhi Shu" was the most famous, dating back about 2,000 years. However, all the agricultural books of the Han Dynasty have been lost, and only a part of the original text of "Fan Shengzhi Shu" has been preserved because it was widely quoted by later generations. Among the agricultural techniques mentioned in "Fan Shengzhi Shu," the most prominent is the Qutian method. This is a set of high-yield farmland technology created by Fan based on summarizing the experience of the masses. Its high-yield target reached "one mu often yields one hundred hu" (equivalent to 28.875 shi per current market mu of millet or wheat). Therefore, later generations have constantly tested and promoted it. In addition, on the basis of heavy use of base fertilizer, the method of fertilizing seeds is also used in coordination. The method is: grinding bone meal, boiling it into a juice to soak aconite, adding sheep manure and mixing it into a thick porridge, and applying it to the seeds. This method is similar to what is called topdressing or seed fertilizer today, which enables seedlings to obtain sufficient nutrients in time near them, and grow vigorously. Because of their strong vitality, they are more resistant to insect pests; because the roots of vigorously growing plants are distributed more widely, they are more drought-resistant. However, whether aconite has the effect of stimulating growth or helping to resist insects remains to be tested. Another example is grafting ten gourd vines into one vine, removing the first three gourds, and leaving only the fourth, fifth, and sixth gourds, which can produce gourds that are ten times larger. These are all more prominent experiences.
    In addition, there are many valuable experiences in the cultivation methods mentioned in "Fan Shengzhi Shu." Here is another example: Fan emphasized seizing the time when the spring thaw first begins to plow the loess soil. This is very reasonable. Loess soil is clay soil. Plowing it when it is moderately moist can produce soil structure. The time when the spring thaw first begins is precisely when the soil is moderately moist. When it is completely thawed, it may be too wet and not suitable for plowing. Moreover, there are many winds in the north in spring, and the moisture in the soil may have evaporated too much when it is completely thawed, making it unsuitable for plowing. Northern China often experiences spring droughts, and there is no guarantee that there will be a suitable opportunity after the spring thaw. Therefore, this moderately moist opportunity is short-lived and disappears quickly, so it must be seized. Regarding this principle, the "Lüshi Chunqiu" "Dian Tu Pian," which was two hundred years earlier than "Fan Shengzhi Shu," already said: "The way of plowing must begin with loess." It can be seen that Fan had inherited and developed the experience of his predecessors over many years. This experience is still valuable today.
    The earliest complete agricultural book existing in our country is "Qimin Yaoshu." This was written by Jia Sixie, our ancient great agricultural scientist, in the 6th century 30s, about 1420 years ago. "Qimin Yaoshu" is more than 500 years later than "Fan Shengzhi Shu." In these more than 500 years, agriculture in our country has made great progress again. "Qimin Yaoshu" can summarize it more comprehensively, so whether it is in terms of the advancement and scientific nature of agricultural technology, or in terms of the breadth of the scope it includes, it far exceeds "Fan Shengzhi Shu." Moreover, the agricultural technology recorded in "Qimin Yaoshu" was unprecedented internationally at that time, and some were more than a thousand years earlier than in Europe.
    Crop rotation is a sign of agricultural progress. Although there are records of rotation of millet and wheat, wheat and millet or beans in the late Warring States period and the two Han dynasties, none of those records clearly mention the benefits of rotation. In "Qimin Yaoshu," the situation is very different. "Qimin Yaoshu" points out which crops need to be rotated with other crops, and points out that if hemp is planted continuously, "there is a danger of premature leaf death, and it is not suitable for making cloth." Moreover, it points out that the previous crops of non-leguminous crops are generally best as leguminous crops. Sometimes, "Qimin Yaoshu" also arranges leguminous green manure crops in the rotation system. In short, "Qimin Yaoshu" has a fairly broad and in-depth understanding of the importance and key points of rotation.
    Regarding crop selection, "Fan Shengzhi Shu" has proposed the ear selection method, but there has been an epoch-making progress in "Qimin Yaoshu." For example, "Qimin Yaoshu" says that not only should the ear selection method be used to select good ears of pure color in the field for seeds, but also the seeds obtained by such ear selection should first be planted in specially set seed fields; then the seeds produced in the seed fields should be sown in the next year's large fields. The seed field should also be given extra care. Only in this way can plump seeds be produced. At harvest, they should be treated and buried separately to avoid mixing with ordinary seeds. Before sowing, the chaff should be removed by water selection.
    "Qimin Yaoshu" not only pays attention to the importance of seed purity, but also attaches importance to the difference between varieties and emphasizes the relationship between varieties and the environment. It says that it must be suitable for the environment in order to "use less effort and achieve more success." Jia also pointed out that crop varieties have their certain adaptation areas. He said: "The peas in Bingzhou are east of Jingxing, and the millet in Shandong enters Huguan and Shangdang, and the seedlings have no fruit." He once divided the 86 famous varieties of millet at that time into four categories. Zhugu and other 14 varieties are early-maturing, drought-resistant, and insect-free; Jin Duo Che and other 24 varieties have awns, are wind-resistant, and bird-proof; Baozhu Huang and other 38 varieties are mid-maturing and have large grains; Zhuyeqing and other 10 varieties are late-maturing, water-resistant, and will be finished if there is an insect disaster. Some of the individual varieties are specially described, such as: "Guo Gu Huang and Ru Dao Liang have two kinds of delicious taste," "Yi Xian Huang is easy to spring." The variety classification method made by Jia is very reasonable.
    The grafting method of pears has been greatly developed in "Qimin Yaoshu." The rootstock is generally Du or Tang, which are plants of the same genus; but jujube, pomegranate, or mulberry can also be used, which is different from pears. The grafting technique described is very detailed and reasonable. Moreover, it is good at using tall rootstocks to make the grafted pear trees grow into large trees quickly. What is especially noteworthy is that "Qimin Yaoshu" clearly points out that the trees grafted with the small branches near the roots of the pear trees have good shapes and bear fruit only after five years; the trees grafted with the old branches of the treetops have ugly shapes and bear fruit in three years. Its clear statement about the earliness or lateness of fruiting has a certain scientific value. Moreover, the small branches near the roots are developmental branches, which have a strong growth potential and are easy to prune and cultivate into a good tree shape; the old branches of the treetops are short fruit branches, which grow slowly, so the tree shape is ugly, and this statement is also in line with the law.
    The cultivation of broad-leaved tree seedlings did not begin in Europe until 1673 in Germany. However, in "Qimin Yaoshu," this is no longer a novelty. For some trees, it also explains why they should be grown in the nursery for several years before being transplanted. For example, elm seedlings, "those who are transplanted at birth are fond of curves, so they must be grown in clusters, and transplanted after three years." Elm seedlings are also transplanted in the third year; moreover, hemp seeds and elm seeds are planted together, and the hemp is harvested when it is ripe. Hemp is still planted under the elm seedlings in the second year, the purpose of which is to force the hemp to grow upwards, "tall and straight, thousands of hundreds of them are the same; if you take and plant them as you see fit, they will not grow straight and slowly, and the trees will also be curved and evil."
    The content of "Qimin Yaoshu" is very broad, and only a few examples can be cited here to see a glimpse. However, in order to combine with other ancient books, let's talk about two more points (animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, brewing).
    Among the livestock part mentioned in "Qimin Yaoshu," the most prominent is the method of judging horses, which occupies a lot of space. According to legend, Bo Le was good at judging horses during the time of Duke Mu of Qin (7th century BC). "Sui Shu" "Jing Ji Zhi" contains "Bo Le Xiang Ma Jing," which is supposedly named after him. However, "Han Shu" "Yi Wen Zhi" already contains "Xiang Liu Chu" 38 volumes. Moreover, Dongmen Jing, who was good at judging horses during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, cast bronze horses. Ma Yuan also cast bronze horses in the early Eastern Han Dynasty, and he also narrated the source of the transmission of his method of judging horses by bones (see "Hou Han Shu" "Ma Yuan Zhuan" for details). It can be seen that this theory has a long history, and "Qimin Yaoshu" inherited this tradition. These traditional sayings are basically in line with modern livestock morphology theories.
    "Qimin Yaoshu" records dozens of prescriptions for treating cattle, horse, and sheep diseases, and points out that some diseases need to be isolated to prevent infection. This also has a long history. "Zhou Li" already had specialized veterinarians. "Sui Shu" "Jing Ji Zhi" already contains eight kinds of special books on veterinary medicine. To this day, traditional Chinese veterinary medicine still plays a great role in rural areas. "Qimin Yaoshu" also mentions the castration of sheep and pigs. The castration method also has a long history, and it has been mentioned in "Zhou Li." The stability and speed of our country's castration operation for female pigs is still rare in the world.
    Using grains to make wine requires saccharification first, and then alcoholization. The distiller's yeast simultaneously cultivates saccharifying mold and alcoholizing yeast, combining the two steps together. This is a great invention of our ancestors, probably starting in the Shang Dynasty. However, the earliest detailed records about making yeast and using yeast to make wine are in "Qimin Yaoshu." It was not until the end of the 19th century that Europe found the main mold from our country's distiller's yeast and established the starch fermentation method in the alcohol industry. "Qimin Yaoshu" also contains methods for making soy sauce, vinegar, fermented soybeans, pickles, salted fish, cheese, etc., which are all related to the fermentation of microorganisms. "Qimin Yaoshu" used three volumes to narrate brewing and food preparation and storage. In addition, we also have various cookbooks, wine classics, and other special books, which show the characteristics of the motherland in these areas.
    There are many ancient agricultural books in our country, and it is impossible to introduce them one by one in this short article. Now, let's talk about ancient agricultural literature in general. In addition to "Fan Shengzhi Shu" and "Qimin Yaoshu," among the existing ancient books that generally discuss agriculture, the more common and generally known ones are the "Chen Fu Nong Shu" of the Song Dynasty, the "Nong Sang Ji Yao" and "Wang Zhen Nong Shu" of the Yuan Dynasty, the "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" and "Qun Fang Pu" of the Ming Dynasty, and the "Shou Shi Tong Kao" and "Zhi Fu Quan Shu" of the Qing Dynasty. The "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" and "Shou Shi Tong Kao" are quite large, both around one million words, and cover a wide range. Although some volumes are not large, the content is very practical, such as "Shen Shi Nong Shu," Zhang Luxiang's "Bu Nong Shu," Pu Songling's "Nong Can Jing," Qi Yunzao's "Ma Shou Nong Yan," etc., all record a lot of local experience. In addition, there are many monographs on one subject, such as horse books, cattle books, veterinary medicine, silkworm books, locust control, bamboo spectrums, tea spectrums, orange records, lychee spectrums, peony spectrums, orchid spectrums, chrysanthemum spectrums, garden history, flower scriptures, etc. There are many such books, and there are more than one hundred kinds of tea books alone.
    Ancient agricultural books and medical books are not only different in subject matter, but also in writing scope and nature. It is the working farmers who master and constantly improve agricultural technology. They cannot write books and establish theories, unlike doctors who can speak and write. Therefore, the following two situations arise:
    First, although the number of doctors is far less than that of farmers, they have written many medical books, and these medical books can be passed down from teachers and apprentices and continue to develop. Although ancient medical books are inevitably lost, they are preserved more because they are maintained by professional doctors. On the contrary, since the authors of agricultural books are not farmers, but intellectuals who pay attention to agricultural research, the number is not large. Therefore, the number of general agricultural books (that is, books that generally discuss agricultural technology other than tea spectrums, flower spectrums, etc.) is dwarfed by the number of medical books, not to mention that agricultural books are not passed down from teachers and apprentices and continue to develop. Moreover, agricultural books are rarely valued by general literati and book collectors, and are easily lost. Not only agricultural books before the Han Dynasty have been lost, but none of the important agricultural books of the Tang Dynasty have been preserved. For example, the "Zhong Shi Zhi Shuo," "Wu Ben Xin Shu," "Wu Ben Zhi Yan," and "Shi Nong Bi Yong" cited by "Nong Sang Ji Yao" and others cannot even find out the author's name and writing date, and are not found in various book catalogs (we have checked more than 700 kinds of catalogs that can be seen in Nanjing). Some agricultural books cannot even find publishing opportunities, and even if they can be printed, very few are circulated. But on the other hand, agriculture is common to most people, and it is related to the lives of the vast majority of people, so there is a lot of information about agriculture in other books.
    Second, since the authors of ancient agricultural books were limited to a small number of intellectuals who paid attention to agricultural research, advanced agricultural knowledge and experience lost the opportunity to be summarized and recorded at any time and place. Moreover, some agricultural operations, although of great value, were not widely spread at the time and did not attract the attention of agricultural book authors. This is the reason why many important agricultural technologies were not recorded. Therefore, only a small part of the valuable experience of farmers can be summarized and recorded, and most of it is only passed down from generation to generation in the practice of farmers.
    Therefore, when we are now sorting out the agricultural heritage of the motherland, on the one hand, we must fully grasp the relevant information in ancient agricultural books and other books (and sometimes we must also take into account archaeological discoveries), and at the same time, we must conduct extensive and in-depth investigations and research on the experiences and achievements obtained in the practice of farmers that have been passed down from generation to generation.
    There is no end to the advanced experience in farmers' practice, but we often see it and do not think it is strange, but it is very valuable in the eyes of international friends. For example, in 1953, Academician Daskalov, Director of the Plant Cultivation Research Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, came to China for inspection and saw that the well cellar storage in different climates and terrains in various parts of China could keep sweet potatoes intact for many years. Various different well cellars have easy methods for heat preservation and ventilation. He believes that this is a very valuable experience. Also, in Houmu Village Station in Dalian, he saw that farmers intercropped cabbage and leeks to prevent cabbage root rot, which he believed was in line with scientific principles. And he introduced the research of Soviet scholar Tokin, which proved that the roots of onions, garlic, etc. secrete a phytobactericide, which has a bactericidal effect. Therefore, some international friends have suggested that we organize and summarize our agricultural experience over the past thousands of years. And they believe that this will definitely help the progress of international agricultural science.
    In short, the agricultural heritage of our motherland is very rich, and it can provide us with a lot of materials for experimental research, which plays an important role in helping to improve the level of agricultural science. We must pay attention to it. However, due to the limitations of the times, our agricultural heritage is naturally mixed with some dross. We need to take a critical attitude when accepting this heritage.

    祖国的丰富的农学遗产
    中国农业遗产研究室主任　万国鼎
    我们祖国有丰富的农学遗产。但是，目前我国农业科学水平还是比较低下的。由于农业社会主义改造的发展，我国农业科学已经远远落后于实际的需要。并且，由于世界农业科学正在迅速前进，我国农业科学也不应该停滞不前。因此，为了建设社会主义，为了提高农业科学水平，我们就要向外国的、特别是苏联的先进农业科学学习。但是，农业是有地方性的，所以我们在学习中必须反对那种教条主义的倾向。我们应该注意本国特点。我国是世界古国之一，人口最多，又一向以勤劳著称，因此，历代以来，我国劳动人民在农业生产斗争中积累了非常辉煌的成就和经验。我国历代劳动人民在农业生产斗争中积累下的这些成就和经验，正是我们在理论结合实际中的宝贵指针。我们必须珍视这份遗产，认真加以整理、研究和发展。
    早在战国时代，我们已经有专门的农书，可惜已经失传，现在只保存了一些鳞爪。但是，从这些鳞爪中，我们也可看出早在二千二百年前我国农学已经达到相当高的水平。例如在“吕氏春秋”“辨土篇”中，对于庄稼的播种，就已作了比较深刻的研究。又如“管子”“地员篇”详细辨别土壤种类，“禹贡”记载不同土壤在全国的分布概况，都能大体符合事实。
    汉朝农书有十多种，其中“泛胜之书”最有名，距今约二千年。但是，汉朝农书都已失传，只有“泛胜之书”因被后人广泛引用，还能保存下来一部分的原文。在“泛胜之书”所说农业技术中，最突出的是区田法。这是泛氏总结群众经验而加以提高创造的一种成套的农田丰产技术。它的丰产目标达到“一亩常收百斛”“（合今一市亩收粟或小麦28.875市石）。因此，后世不断有人对它加以试验和推行。又如在重用基肥的基础上，还配合着采用粪种法。其方法是：锉骨粉煮汁渍附子，加羊粪搅和如稠粥状，溲附在种子上。这个方法类似今日所谓补肥或种肥，能使幼苗在其附近及时取得充足养料，生长旺盛。因为生活力强，所以较能抵抗虫害；因为生长旺盛的根系分布较广，所以也就较能耐旱。不过，附子有没有刺激生长的作用或帮助抗虫的作用，还待试验。又如把十株瓠蔓嫁接成一蔓，去掉初生三子，只留四五六三子，可以结出十倍大的大瓠（葫芦）。这些都是较突出的经验。
    此外，“泛胜之书”所说栽培法中，还有不少宝贵经验。这里再举一个例子，泛氏十分强调在春冻初解时，抓紧时间，先耕垆土。这是很合理的。垆土是粘质土，在湿润适度的时候耕，可以产生土壤结构。春冻初解时，正是土壤湿润适度的时候。全解时可能过湿，不宜耕了。并且，北方春季多风，在全解时土中水分更有可能已经蒸发过多，也不宜耕。北方往往春旱，春冻初解以后也就不能保证再有适宜时机。因此，这种湿润适宜的时机是短促的，稍纵即去，所以必须抓紧。关于这个道理，比“泛胜之书”早二百年的“吕氏春秋”“辨土篇”里已经说过：“凡耕之道，必始于垆”。由此可见，泛氏已经承继和发扬前人的多年经验。这一经验，直到现在仍有价值。
    我国现存最早的完整农书是“齐民要术”。这是我们古代伟大的农业科学家贾思勰在六世纪三十年代写成的，距今约一千四百二十多年。“齐民要术”后于“泛胜之书”五百多年。在这五百多年中，我国农业又有了很大的进步，“齐民要术”能比较全面地加以总结，所以无论是就农业技术的先进性和科学性来说，或者是就包括范围的广泛性来说，它都远远超过“泛胜之书”。而且“齐民要术”所记农业技术在当时国际间也是空前的，有些更比欧洲早了一千年以上。
    作物轮栽是农业进步的一种标帜。虽则战国后期和两汉已有粟和麦轮栽、麦和粟或豆轮栽的记载，但是那些记载都没有明白谈到轮栽的好处。在“齐民要术”里，情况就大不同了。“齐民要术”指出哪些作物需要和别种作物轮栽，指出麻若连栽，“有点叶夭折之患，不任作布”。而且，指出非豆科作物的前作物，一般以豆科作物为佳。有时“齐民要术”还把豆科绿肥作物编排在轮栽制度里。总之，“齐民要术”对于轮栽的重要性和要点，已有颇为广泛而深入的认识。
    关于作物选种，“泛胜之书”已提出穗选法，但是在“齐民要术”里又有划时代的进步。例如“齐民要术”中说，不但要用穗选法在田间选取好穗纯色的留作种子，而且要把这样穗选得来的种子，先种在特设的留种田里；再用留种田生产出来的种子，播种在下一年的大田里。对于留种田，还要加意照顾。只有这样，才能生出饱满的种子。收获时还要先治别埋，以免和一般种子混杂。播种前还要用水选法剔去秕粒。
    “齐民要术”不但注意种子纯洁的重要性，并且重视品种的区别，强调品种和环境的关系。它说，必须适合环境，才能“用力少而成功多”。贾氏还指出作物品种有它们的一定的适应区域。他说：“并州豌豆度井陉以东，山东谷子入壶关、上党，苗而无实”。他曾经把当时谷子的八十六种有名品种分为四大类。朱谷等十四种早熟，耐旱，免虫；今墮车等二十四种有芒，耐风，免雀暴；宝珠黄等三十八种中熟，大谷；竹叶青等十种晚熟，耐水，遇有虫灾就完了。对于其中个别品种，有的还有特殊描写，如说：“聒谷黄、辱稻粮二种味美”，“一晛黄一种易春”。贾氏所作的这种品种分类法是很合理的。
    梨的嫁接法，在“齐民要术”中有了突出发展。砧木一般用杜或棠，这些是同属的植物；但是也可用枣、石榴或桑，这就和梨不同科了。所说嫁接技术，很是细致合理。而且善于利用高大的砧木，使嫁接上去的梨树迅速地长成大树。尤其值得注意的是，“齐民要术”明白指出，用梨的近根小枝接的，树形好看，五年方才结果子；用树梢鸠脚老枝接的，树形丑，三年就结果子。它对结果迟早的明说，是有一定的科学的价值的。而且近根小枝是发育枝，生长势强，容易整枝而培养成好的树形；鸠脚老枝是短果枝，生长慢，所以树形丑，这个说法也是合于规律的。
    阔叶树育苗，在欧洲直到1673年才开始于德国。但是，在“齐民要术”里，这已经不是新鲜事物了。对有些树它还说明为什么要先在苗圃生长几年后才移栽。例如榆树苗，“初生即移者喜曲，故须丛林长之，三年乃移种”。槐树苗也种到第三年才移栽；而且还把麻子和槐子合种，麻熟刈去，第二年仍在槐苗下种麻，目的在使麻逼槐向上生长，“亭亭条直，千百若一；若随宜取栽，匪直长迟，树亦曲恶”。
    “齐民要术”的内容很广博，这里只能略举数例，以见一斑。不过，为了结合其他古书，再举两点（畜牧兽医、酿造）来谈一谈。
    “齐民要术”所说家畜部分，其中最突出的是相马法，占了不少篇幅。相传秦穆公时（公元前七世纪）伯乐善于相马。“隋书”“经籍志”载有“伯乐相马经”，当是托名的。但是“汉书”“艺文志”已载有“相六畜”38卷。而且汉武帝时善相马者东门京铸造铜马。东汉初马援又铸造铜马，他还叙说他的相马骨法的传授来源（详见“后汉书”“马援传”）。可见这种学说是很有来历的，“齐民要术”承继了这一传统。这些传统说法，基本上是和现代家畜外形学说符合的。
    “齐民要术”记载了几十个治牛马羊疾病方，并且指出有的疾病需要隔离，以防传染。这也是很有来历的。“周礼”上已有专门的兽医。“隋书”“经籍志”已载有关于兽医的专书八种。至今中兽医仍在农村中起着很大的作用。“齐民要术”又说到羊和猪的去势。去势法也有很长的历史，“周礼”上已提到。我国对于雌猪的去势手术的稳妥迅速，至今世界上仍是极少见的。
    用谷类做酒，需要先糖化，再酒化，酒曲中同时培养了糖化的霉菌和酒化的酵母菌，把两个步骤结合起来，这是我们祖先的伟大发明 ，大概始于商代。但是，现存关于作曲和用曲酿酒的详细记载，首推“齐民要术”。欧洲直到十九世纪末才从我国酒曲中找出主要霉菌，建立起酒精工业上的淀粉发酵法。“齐民要术”还载有做酱、醋、豉、葅、鮓、酪等多种方法，这些都和微生物的发酵作用有关系。“齐民要术”用了三卷的篇幅叙说酿造和食品的调制和贮藏。此外，我们还有多种食谱、酒经一类的专书，表现出祖国在这些方面的特色。
    我国古代农书很多，在这篇短文里，不能一一介绍。现在仅把古代农业文献综合起来谈一谈。除“泛胜之书”和“齐民要术”外，现存总论农业的古书中，比较普通而为一般人所习知的有宋朝的“陈旉农书”，元朝的“农桑辑要”和“王祯农书”，明朝的“农政全书”和“群芳谱”，清朝的“授时通考”和“致富全书”等。“农政全书”和“授时通考”的篇幅相当大，都在一百万字左右，包括范围很广。有些篇幅虽然不大，但是内容也都很切实际，如“沈氏农书”、张履祥的“补农书”、蒲松龄的“农蚕经”、祁?藻的“马首农言”等，都记载了不少当地的经验。此外，还有不少专论一门的著述，如马书、牛书、兽医、蚕书、治蝗、竹谱、茶谱、橘录、荔枝谱、牡丹谱、兰谱、菊谱、圃史、花经之类。这类书籍数量很多，单是茶书一类，就在一百种以上。
    古代农书和医书不单在科目上有所不同，在写作范围、性质上也有很大区别。掌握和不断改进农业技术的是劳动农民，他们不能著书立说，不像医生那样能说能写。因此，产生如下两种情况：
    一是医生人数虽然远不如农民多，但是写成很多医书，而且这些医书能够得到师徒相承，继续发展。虽则古代医书也不免有散失，但是因为有专业的医生维护，保存下来比较地多。反之，农书作者既然不是农民，而是知识分子中留心研究农业的人，人数究竟不多，因此一般农书（即茶谱、花谱等以外总论农业技术的书），其数量若与医书比较起来，就相形见绌了，何况农书也无师徒相传而获继续发挥。并且，农书很少受到一般文人和藏书家的重视，很易失传。不但汉以前的农书失传，唐朝的几种重要的农书也都没有一种保存下来。如“农桑辑要”等所引的“种莳直说”、“务本新书”、“务本直言”和“士农必用”等书，连作者姓名和写作年代都查不出来，也不见于各家书目（我们已查阅过在南京所能看到700多种目录类的书）。甚至有些农书不能找到出版机会，即使能够印出的也流传极少。但是另一方面，农业为一般人所习见，而且关系绝大多数人的生活，因此，其他各种书籍中有关农业的资料是非常多的。
    二是古代农书作者既然限于少数留心研究农业的知识分子，农业先进知识和经验失去了随时随地被总结记录的机会。而且有些农事操作虽有重要价值，但在当时流传并不普遍，引不起农书作者的注意，这是不少重要的农业技术没有被记载下来的原因。所以农民的宝贵经验能被总结而记录下来的只有一小部分，而大部分只是世代流传在农民的实践中。
    因此，我们现在整理祖国农业遗产，一方面固然必须充分掌握古农书和其他书籍上的有关资料（有时还须兼及考古学上的发现），同时必须广泛而深入地调查研究那些世代流传在农民实践中的经验和实践所获得的成就。
    农民实践中的先进经验是说不尽的，但是，我们往往习见而不以为奇，而在国际友人看来却很宝贵。例如，1953年保加利亚科学院植物栽培研究所所长达斯卡洛夫院士来我国考察，看到我国各地不同气候和地形下的井窖贮藏，可使甘薯保持经年不坏。各种不同井窖在保温通风等方面，都有轻而易举的方法。他认为这是十分可贵的经验。又如，他在大连后牧村驿看到农民把白菜和韭菜间作，防止白菜根腐病，认为这很合于科学原理。并且介绍苏联学者托金的研究，证明洋葱、蒜等的根部分泌一种植物杀菌素，有杀菌作用。因此，有些国际友人向我们建议，整理总结我们几千年来的农业经验。并且认为，这样必将有助于国际农业科学的进步。
    总之，我们祖国的农业遗产是很丰富的，可以提供给我们不少试验研究的材料，在帮助提高农业科学水平上，有重要作用。我们必须予以重视。不过，我国农业遗产由于时代的限制，自然不免夹杂着一些糟粕。我们在接受这份遗产时，需要采取批判态度。
