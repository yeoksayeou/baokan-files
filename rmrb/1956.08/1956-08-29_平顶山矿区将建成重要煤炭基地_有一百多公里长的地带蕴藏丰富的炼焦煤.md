Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th: Pingdingshan, which is rich in coking coal, will be built into one of China's important coal bases. According to the plan, by the end of 1959, the total designed annual output of the modern large-scale vertical shafts put into production and under construction in the Pingdingshan area will make it one of the largest coal mines in China.

    Currently, three pairs of vertical shafts in the mining area are under intense construction day and night. Construction preparations have begun or are about to begin for another three pairs of large-scale vertical shafts, with construction scheduled to start next year. The scale of these three pairs of large-scale vertical shafts, and the large-scale vertical shafts to be built subsequently, will be equal to the famous Dongshan vertical shaft.

    To support mine construction and production needs, a new industrial zone has been designated. The Central Machinery Repair Plant is being designed and construction will begin next year. Two modern washing and screening plants have begun collecting construction data. A fairly large-scale thermal power plant will start construction soon. To ensure that a large number of materials needed for the construction period of each mine can be transported in time, and that the coal mined after it is put into production can be quickly transported to the washing and screening plant, the mining area's railway special line is under intense construction. It is expected that by the end of this year, construction materials from all over the country can be transported to the mining area by train.

    With the accelerated construction of the coal base, a new "coal mining city" is taking shape. To date, 30,000 square meters of workers' dormitories have been completed. A complete middle school has already started. Another coal mining school for training intermediate technical personnel will also start classes on September 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th: Many rich deposits of coking coal have been discovered in the area around Pingdingshan in central Henan Province, extending more than 100 kilometers from Shoushan Mountain in Xiangcheng County in the east to Chaochuan in Linru County in the west.

    The quality of coal in this area is very good. The thickest layer of standard prime coking coal, preliminarily proven in Chaochuan, reaches 17 meters, and the ash content of the coal is very low, so it can be coked without washing. In the Pingdingshan area, some of the coal quality is close to prime coking coal, and most of it is fat coal (i.e. blending coal), which can also be coked when combined with an auxiliary coking coal produced by the Hebi Coal Mine in northern Henan; although the ash content of the upper layers of coal is high and not suitable for coking, the firepower is very strong, making it the best fuel for power plants, trains, and ships. These coal seams are stable, the geological structure is simple, and they are easy to mine. Each of the eleven layers of coal that can be mined is more than one meter thick, and the thickest is up to nine meters. If large-scale vertical shafts are built, with depths not exceeding 500 meters, all the coal can be mined.

    According to the geological engineers responsible for exploring this coalfield, it is speculated that coalfields may continue to be found around the currently discovered coking coal areas, and will be connected to other large coalfield areas in western Henan. Currently, a physical exploration team is conducting a general survey in the surrounding areas according to this inference.

### 平顶山矿区将建成重要煤炭基地  有一百多公里长的地带蕴藏丰富的炼焦煤

    平顶山矿区将建成重要煤炭基地
    有一百多公里长的地带蕴藏丰富的炼焦煤
    据新华社郑州28日电　蕴藏着丰富的炼焦煤的平顶山，将要建设成为我国重要的煤炭基地之一。按照规划，到1959年底，平顶山地区投入生产和正在建设的现代化大型竖井，根据其设计年产总量计算，将成为我国最大的煤矿之一。
    现在，矿区的三对竖井正在不分昼夜地紧张施工。还有三对大型竖井开始和即将开始进行施工准备工作，决定明年动工兴建。这三对大型竖井和以后将继续兴建的大型竖井，规模都同著名的东山竖井相等。
    为配合矿井建设和生产需要，新兴的工业区已经划定。中央机修厂正在进行设计，将在明年开始施工。两座现代化的洗选厂已经开始搜集建厂资料。一座具有相当规模的火力发电厂，最近就要开工。为了保证各大矿井在建设时期能及时运进所需的大批器材，和在投入生产后所开采出的煤炭能迅速运到洗选厂，矿区的铁路专用线正在紧张施工。预计到今年年底，来自全国各地的建设器材，就可以用火车运达矿区。
    随着煤炭基地建设的加速进行，一座新兴的“煤矿城”正在形成。到目前，三万平方公尺的工人宿舍已经完工。一所完全中学已经开学。另一座培养中级技术人员的煤矿学校，也将在9月1日开课。
    据新华社郑州28日电　在河南省中部平顶山的周围，东起襄城县首山，西到临汝县朝川全长一百多公里的地方，又发现了许多蕴藏量丰富的炼焦煤。
    这一地带的煤的质量很好。在朝川初步探明的标准主焦煤，最厚的一层达到十七公尺，煤的灰粉很低，不经过洗选就可以炼焦。在平顶山一带，一部分煤质近于主焦煤，多数为肥煤（即配焦煤），和豫北鹤壁煤矿所产的一种辅助炼焦煤配合一起，也可以炼焦；靠上面几层煤虽然灰粉较高，不适于炼焦，但是火力很强，是发电厂、火车、轮船的最好燃料。这些煤层平稳，地质构造简单，便于开采。可供开采的十一层煤，每层厚度都在一公尺以上，最厚的达九公尺。如果建设大型竖井，深度都不超过五百公尺，就能把煤全部开采出来。
    据负责勘探这一带煤田的地质工程师推断，在目前已经发现炼焦煤地区的周围，还可能继续找到煤田，并且将和豫西的其它几个大煤田区互相连接。现在，有一个物理探矿队正在按照这个推断，继续在外围地区进行普查。
