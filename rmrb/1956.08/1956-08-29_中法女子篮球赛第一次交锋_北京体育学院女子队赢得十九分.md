    First Encounter in China-France Women's Basketball Game
    Beijing Institute of Physical Education Women's Team Wins by Nineteen Points
    (Our Dispatch) The French Marseille University Sports Club Women's Basketball Team, which is visiting our country, lost its first game last night at the Beijing Gymnasium to the Beijing Institute of Physical Education Women's Basketball Team by a score of 50 to 69. The scores for the first three quarters were 20 to 12, 32 to 24, and 48 to 37, all with the Institute of Physical Education team in the lead.

    The Marseille University Women's Basketball Team's speed, teamwork, passing, and dribbling were all good, but their shooting was not accurate enough. Number 12, Li Bao, the center of the Marseille University team, is a member of the French National Women's Basketball Team. She has extremely strong mobility under the basket, and her turnaround shots are also relatively accurate. In the first quarter, all six goals, totaling twelve points, were scored by her alone. Other national team members, such as number 9, Vileano, and number 14, Maxine, are also skilled in dribbling past opponents; number 3, Savili, plays as bravely as a man. Throughout the game, the Marseille University team demonstrated good sportsmanship.

    The Institute of Physical Education team members were very active on offense and had a strong fighting spirit. Ma Shenmei and Hu Yingxin both made several accurate mid-range shots; however, the entire team's coordination, passing, and defense of the center were not up to par, and in particular, they lacked methods for attacking zone defenses.

    中法女子篮球赛第一次交锋
    北京体育学院女子队赢得十九分
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的法国马赛市大学体育俱乐部女子篮球队昨晚在北京体育馆举行的第一场比赛，以五十比六十九输给北京体育学院女子篮球队。前三节的比分是二十比十二，三十二比二十四，四十八比三十七，都是体育学院队占先。
    马赛市大学女子篮球队队员的速度、互相配合和传球、带球等都很好，可惜投篮不够准确。马赛市大学队中锋十二号丽苞是法国国家女子篮球队队员，他在篮下活动能力极强，反身投篮也较准确，第一节六个球十二分都是他一手独得的。其他国家队员像九号维勒诺和十四号玛茜妮的带球过人技术也很熟练；三号萨维丽打球像男子一样勇猛。在整个比赛中，马赛市大学队表现了良好的运动道德作风。
    体育学院队队员进攻很积极，斗志坚强，马申妹、胡英信的几次在中距离投篮都很准；但是整个队在比赛中的配合、传带和防守中锋等方面，都没有达到应有的水平，特别是对于进攻联防缺少办法。
