Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: Seven thousand five hundred Japanese workers at the U.S. Military Tachikawa Air Base near Tokyo began a twenty-four-hour strike yesterday morning to protest the U.S. military authorities' illegal dismissal of twenty-two Japanese workers.

The striking workers, belonging to the All-Garrison Workers' Union, also oppose the recently signed Japan-U.S. agreement regarding regulations for punishing Japanese workers at U.S. military bases.

Leaders of the All-Garrison Workers' Union said that their union is also preparing to hold a nationwide strike on August 20 to protest these regulations which infringe upon the basic human rights of Japanese workers.
