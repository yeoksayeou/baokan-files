    New Products Trial-produced by Daye Steel Plant are Successively Leaving the Factory
    Four Units of Benxi Iron and Steel Company Receive Awards in Inter-Factory Competition

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The twenty-two new varieties and new specifications of steel trial-produced by Daye Steel Plant in the first half of this year have now mostly left the factory successively and been handed over to the ordering units. The new varieties and new specifications of steel trial-produced in these six months are more than twice the number trial-produced in the entire year of last year.

    The newly made steel includes high-quality spring steel trial-produced in open-hearth furnaces, stainless and heat-resistant steel trial-produced in electric furnaces, small-specification round steel, and wide flat steel, etc.; among them, the high-quality spring steel trial-produced in open-hearth furnaces has not yet been trial-produced by other factories in China, and it is a good steel for manufacturing locomotives.

    Of the new steel trial-produced in the first half of the year, in addition to two new varieties and five new specifications of steel that were designated for trial production by the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the rest were expanded trial production by Daye Steel Plant itself in order to meet the requirements of ordering units.

    According to Daye Steel Plant's plan for trial production of new products this year, the scope of trial production will be further expanded in the second half of the year, so as to gradually solve the problem of the narrow range of steel varieties and patterns in the factory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 15th: Four units affiliated with Benxi Iron and Steel Company, including Nanfen Iron Mine, Benxi Steel Plant, Benxi Refractory Material Plant, and Tongyuanpu Iron Mine, have been evaluated as advanced and awarded units in the second quarter of the national iron and steel industry inter-factory and inter-mine socialist competition, along with twenty-three other units across the country. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently issued a circular, deciding to award these four factories and mines a bonus of 25,300 yuan.

    Nanfen Iron Mine was rated first among the national iron mine inter-mine competition advanced units. In the second quarter, this mine completed the various targets of output, cost, labor productivity, and stripping volume, and there was not a single major personal injury accident in the entire quarter. Advanced unit Benxi Steel Plant completed the state plan more comprehensively in the second quarter, and the new product trial production task was also fully completed, and there was also great progress in completing orders from various places. In addition, six technical and economic indicators of Benxi Steel Plant and Benxi Refractory Material Plant reached the national advanced level.

    The four units of Benxi Iron and Steel Company that won awards this time widely exchanged and promoted advanced experiences in the inter-factory and inter-mine socialist competition. After Nanfen Iron Mine promoted Li Qingzhen's mining experience, each rock drill was able to mine more than 50 tons per shift in the second quarter, an increase of more than eight tons in efficiency compared with the first quarter. Tongyuanpu Iron Mine's promotion of Longyan Iron Mine's Ma Wanshui rapid tunneling experience also achieved great results. In the second quarter, Benxi Steel Plant also exchanged advanced experiences in forging steel and steelmaking with similar steel plants across the country. This steel plant used the "arc-shaped anvil" forging steel affirmed by the National Forged Steel Advanced Experience Exchange Conference in August, and the efficiency has increased by about 20%.

    大冶钢厂试制的新产品陆续出厂
    本溪钢铁公司四单位在厂际竞赛中受奖
    新华社讯　大冶钢厂在今年上半年内试制的二十二种新品种同新规格的钢材，现在大部分已经陆续出厂，交给订货单位。这半年试制的新品种同新规格的钢材，比去年一年内所试制的多了两倍以上。
    新制的钢材包括平炉试炼的优质弹簧钢、电炉试炼的不锈耐热钢、小规格元钢以及宽扁钢等；其中用平炉试炼的优质弹簧钢，是国内各厂尚未试制过的，它是制造机车用的良好钢材。
    上半年试制的新钢材，除有两个新品种和五个新规格的钢材是冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局指定试制的以外，其余都是大冶钢厂为满足订货单位要求而自行扩大试制的。
    按照大冶钢厂今年试制新产品的规划，在下半年之内还将进一步扩大试制范围，以便逐步解决本厂钢材品种花色范围狭窄的问题。
    新华社本溪15日电　本溪钢铁公司所属南芬铁矿、本溪钢厂、本溪耐火材料厂、通远堡铁矿等四个单位，在全国钢铁工业厂际和矿际社会主义竞赛中，已和全国其他二十三个单位一起，被评为第二季度的竞赛先进单位和得奖单位。冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局最近发出通报，决定奖给这四个厂矿奖金二万五千三百多元。
    南芬铁矿被评为全国铁矿矿际竞赛先进单位第一名。在第二季度里，这个矿完成了产量、成本、劳动生产率、剥离量各项指标，全季没有发生过一次重大人身事故。先进单位本溪钢厂第二季度的国家计划完成得比较全面，新产品试制任务也全部完成，完成各地订货也有很大进步。此外，本溪钢厂、本溪耐火材料厂有六项技术经济指标达到了全国先进水平。
    本溪钢铁公司这次得奖的四个单位，在厂、矿际社会主义竞赛中广泛地交流和推广了先进经验。南芬铁矿推广了李庆振的采矿经验以后，在第二季度里每台凿岩机每班已能采矿五十多吨，效率比第一季度提高八吨多。通远堡铁矿推广龙烟铁矿马万水快速掘进经验，也收到了很大效果。在第二季度里本溪钢厂还和全国同类钢厂先后交流了锻钢和炼钢方面的先进经验。这个钢厂在八月份使用了全国锻钢先进经验交流会议所肯定的“弧形砧子”锻钢，效率已经提高了20％左右。
