Shanghai Boiler Factory Enters the Advanced Ranks
By our reporter Ji Yin

　　The good news that the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory had completed its Five-Year Plan eighteen months ahead of schedule is one of the most noteworthy events in Shanghai's state-owned factories this year.

　　A year ago, the Shanghai Boiler Factory was one of the most chaotic enterprises in terms of production. Now, it has transformed into a member of the advanced ranks.

　　"How did the Shanghai Boiler Factory catch up?" Many people are interested in this question.

　　Surrounded by Chaos

　　Since 1954, the Shanghai Boiler Factory had failed to complete the state plan for eighteen months. The factory's transformation began around July last year. At that time, it was also the most difficult period for the factory. In modern large-scale industry with thousands of workers, nothing is more frightening than chaos, and this was the fatal problem of the boiler factory at the time. Various departments shirked responsibility and blamed each other. Dispatch meetings were often quarrelsome. Dispatchers ran all over the factory, saying: "Our factory is a workshop for sectional dispatchers, and the workshops dispatch to the factory headquarters." Chaos opened the door to errors. In May last year, there were 1,025 drawing errors in one month alone. Waste had become a disaster. People said that here "steel paved the roads, and gold was everywhere." In a scrap collection campaign in the third quarter of last year, 460 tons of various steels were found... As a result of all kinds of production chaos, the plan could not be completed, the enterprise's finances were exhausted, and bank debts reached 4.6 million yuan. In the first half of last year, interest payments alone were nearly 170,000 yuan.

　　At that time, the factory was "besieged on all sides": users sent letters questioning the quality of the products, higher authorities and public opinion criticized the factory for failing to complete the plan for a long time, and the factory's employees were ashamed to work at the boiler factory. Some workers took off their badges and put them in their pockets when they walked outside the factory.

　　In this situation, the factory leadership, in accordance with the instructions of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, organized all cadres in the factory to conduct a heated discussion on how to rectify the enterprise. The discussion finally focused on one point: Where did the chaos in production originate?

　　Where Does the Chaos Come From?

　　The fundamental reason for the production chaos in the Shanghai Boiler Factory was the serious subjectivist style of work of the enterprise leadership, which was divorced from reality.

　　The Shanghai Boiler Factory started to implement planned management in 1952, but why was it never able to establish production order? It turned out that their set of planned management systems was not combined with the actual situation of the factory, but was copied from general machinery factories. For example, the metal structure workshop of the factory promoted the "one sequence, one ticket" system (that is, one work ticket for one process) according to the method of the Shenyang Machinery Third Factory. However, the cold work in this workshop was very simple. A punch, a cut, and less than a minute was one process. As a result of the implementation of the "one sequence, one ticket" system, the workers were too busy to record the tickets and had to stuff them in their pockets. When they got off work, they piled a large pile of tickets in front of the timekeeper. The result of mechanically copying this system actually affected production. For example, they once promoted the system of formulating individual work plans according to the experience of general factories, but the fire workshop worked in cooperation as a group. Only group plans could be made, not individual plans. The result of the implementation divided the workers in the group.

　　The manifestation of subjectivism divorced from reality in another aspect was the serious generalization of leadership work. They resolutely implemented the instructions of higher authorities, but often did not conduct research in combination with the specific conditions of the enterprise. After the ministry and bureau deployed the work for a year or a quarter, the factory almost reprinted these documents without any modification as the work plan for the factory. If their plan had any characteristics, its characteristic was generalization. It did not show the specific contradictions of the factory, did not show the center of a certain period, did not show the specific implementation methods of these tasks, and could not be checked at all. This quarter and that quarter, last month and next month, could be used as long as the numbers were changed. They called this plan a "dogmatic standard plan" because the articles listed above all seemed correct, but they could not be specifically used to guide the work.

　　Identify Characteristics

　　After examining the past subjectivist style of work, the leadership of the Shanghai Boiler Factory realized that if they wanted to end the chaos and organize production well, they must start from the specific situation of the enterprise, that is, they must focus on the characteristics of boiler production.

　　The boiler factory has many characteristics that are different from other machinery factories. For example, boiler production must be closely linked with users and power station design units. It must be produced according to the layout of the power station and the different natural conditions of the local area. In addition, the boiler is a set of joint equipment, and many parts need to be coordinated by other specialized factories. Therefore, if boiler factory production is to be done well, it must closely contact the users and cooperative factories. However, in the past, they did not establish corresponding organizations and systems according to this characteristic. The contact with cooperative factories was only an incidental task of the supply section. Later, when they truly grasped this production "key," the effect was completely different from the past.

　　Here I will give two examples to illustrate.

　　One of the characteristics of boiler production is that there are many product components and complex parts (there are more than 110,000 parts). According to this characteristic, in organizing production, we must attach importance to expanding the generalization and standardization of components and parts, so as to maximize the advantages of batch production in single small batch production (a large part of boiler components and parts can be generalized and standardized). That is to say, if half of the components and parts can be made into general parts and standard parts, the workload can be reduced by half. This key issue in boiler production was completely ignored by them in the past. Each boiler was designed and manufactured separately, wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. Now, they have placed this work in the most important position, gradually expanding the generalization of components and parts, and realizing batch production, which has greatly relieved all production links in the factory.

　　Raw materials are also a major issue in boiler production. There are many specifications and types of materials in boiler production, and the consumption is large, accounting for more than 70% of the production cost. This important part was also relaxed in the past. The serious waste of materials caused the high production cost. Now, they have simplified the material specifications on the premise of not affecting the quality, reducing the original 421 types to 240 types, reducing the waste of materials, improving work efficiency, and reducing costs.

　　They proceeded from the specific situation of the enterprise in this way and resolutely carried out some things that should be promoted and reformed. These tasks were included in the production technology organization measures plan, mobilizing all employees to do it. The leadership regularly checked and summarized monthly, and the production order began to be established. A runaway horse was finally tamed.

　　Compressing Time Spent in the Office

　　While criticizing the subjectivist style of work, the leadership of the boiler factory also fought against bureaucracy. In the past, their subjectivism was intertwined with bureaucracy and red tape. They spent too much time floating above, busy with meetings, issuing documents, and spending their days in meetings and quarrels, dragging the cadres of various sections and workshops to spend their days in meetings. They had 253 meetings in 77 days, averaging more than three times a day, which was really dizzying. Where did they have time to solve various specific problems in production?

　　Since the second half of last year, they have clarified the division of labor of factory-level leaders, determined several regular meetings, resolutely compressed all dispensable meetings, and advocated that cadres go deep into the masses more, specifically arrange work, and organize inspections. After often going down to contact the masses, their minds became much clearer, and the news became more informed. To give a small example, a few days ago, a typhoon passed through Shanghai. The roofs of the houses of 17 workers in the factory were uncovered by the wind, and 108 workers needed temporary relief. Because the leading cadres often ran down, they quickly figured out the matter, let the workers whose houses were damaged move into the workers' dormitory, and provided relief to those in difficulty. In this way, the problem was solved before the workers came to the door.

　　Of course, going to the masses should not be aimless. In addition to having a certain amount of time to go to the workshop every day, they mainly go down in a planned and organized manner to help the workshop solve problems. For example, the metal structure workshop has always been very backward, becoming a weak link in the factory's production, and its output value is the largest, which has a great impact on the completion of the factory's production tasks. The factory director and chief engineer took the lead in organizing section personnel to help the workshop specifically study the reasons for the backward production. After spending more than two months, they finally found the root cause and reversed the chaotic situation. This workshop broke through the level reached by the factory's 1959 plan in May this year and became an advanced workshop.

　　Work is Full of Vitality

　　The most important task of going to the masses is to summarize and promote advanced experience. In February this year, the Shanghai Boiler Factory organized a successful work of promoting advanced experience of the same kind of work, which pushed the factory's struggle against subjectivism to a new level.

　　They also promoted advanced experience in the past, and it was very lively. They sent people to learn the most popular advanced experience in each period. But the results were all like a gust of wind, and the results were not great. What is the reason? The reason is that the guiding work is still subjectivist and formalist, and the promotion of advanced experience is out of touch with the actual production needs and the production experience of the masses. What are the weak links in production that need to promote advanced experience, and what good experience do the masses have? They had no idea.

　　This year, they resolutely changed the past practices, studied what weak links in production are there? Then they went deep down to summarize the creations of the masses. When they faced the masses to find solutions, their horizons were opened, their confidence was enhanced, and how many Zhuge Liangs there were among the workers! The lack of drillers has always been a threat to their production, but there is Li Fuxiang among the drillers who has not had a machine tool accident for three years, and there is Qiu Shenggen, whose work efficiency has been several times higher than others for more than two years. There are such heroes in many weak parts of production. They used the method of holding meetings of the same kind of work, first summarized the 24 experiences of drillers Li Fuxiang, Qiu Shenggen, etc. After these experiences were promoted, the efficiency of drillers generally increased by more than one time, and this weak link that had been affecting production for a long time was finally resolved. Then, in the 24 major types of work in the factory, experience exchange meetings were held, summarizing 242 native experiences, of which 140 have been promoted, and the work efficiency has generally increased by 50% or one time.

　　In promoting advanced experience, they also paid attention to learning foreign experience, but no longer blindly copied it as in the past, but learned it according to actual needs. Planing has always been a relatively backward type of work, and this time the experience of the wonderful planer of the fraternal factory was promoted in planing. They promoted a total of nine advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and fraternal factories.

　　When they began to overcome subjectivism and formalism and organized the promotion of advanced experience with correct methods, the connection between the leadership and the masses was unprecedentedly close, the production work became full of vitality, and there was no longer any worry about not having a solution.

　　Great Unity of the Whole Factory

　　There is also the most important driving force for the Shanghai Boiler Factory to gradually get rid of backwardness, that is, unity, the unity of the whole factory.

　　The unity of the leading cadres of the factory and the internal unity of the Party committee are the core of the unity of the whole factory. In the past, the leading cadres of the Shanghai Boiler Factory were not united enough, which hindered the collective leadership role of the Party. This was an important reason for the long-term backwardness of the enterprise. Now, they have replaced the one-chief system with the collective leadership of the Party. Under the collective leadership of the Party committee, they unify their thinking, unify their strength, unify their steps, and collectively discuss all major issues. They promptly summarize and inspect, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. In the normal democratic life, the members of the Party committee have established solid unity.

　　While transforming the enterprise, they also carried out a lot of work to understand and care for people. The leading cadres have all gone to the workshops and dormitories to understand the suffering of the workers and solve some of their difficulties in life. A reward system was implemented, and 7,457 people received awards in the first half of this year. In addition, the employees were evaluated twice, and nearly 1,500 employees were promoted. In doing people's work, they paid special attention to the work of cadres and boldly promoted 258 outstanding cadres to take on leadership work in one year. In the past, the factory leadership often adopted simplified methods for cadres and employees who made mistakes, and criticized and punished them excessively. This time, they revoked the punishment of 61 people based on the degree of improvement of these people.

　　The result of these measures is that the employees of the whole factory are better united around the Party, the advanced ranks have been expanded, and there were only 504 advanced and outstanding workers in the fourth quarter of last year, which has increased to 1,123 in the second quarter of this year. Dozens of advanced collectives have also emerged.

　　The current situation is completely reversed compared with a year ago. The victory of the struggle against subjectivism has pushed the work of the Shanghai Boiler Factory to a new height.

    上海锅炉厂走进了先进行列
    本报记者　季音
    国营上海锅炉厂提前十八个月完成五年计划的喜讯，是今年上海国营工厂中最引人注意的事件之一。
    一年以前，上海锅炉厂还是生产最紊乱的一个企业，现在一变而为先进行列中的一员了。
    “上海锅炉厂是怎样赶上来的呢？”许多人对这个问题发生了兴趣。
    被混乱包围着
    1954年以来，上海锅炉厂曾经有十八个月没有完成国家计划，这个厂的变化是从去年七月间开始的。那时候，也正是工厂最困难的时期。在拥有数千工人的现代大工业里，没有比混乱更可怕的了，而锅炉厂当时致命的问题就是这个。各部门互相扯皮，互相埋怨，调度会经常是吵架会，调度员满厂跑，他们说：“我们厂是工段调度车间，车间调度厂部。”混乱给差错打开了方便之门，去年五月份一个月就发生图纸错误1，025次。浪费已成了灾害，人们说这里是“钢铁铺路，黄金遍地”，去年第三季度的一次搜集废旧料运动中，零零碎碎的就翻出了各种钢材四百六十吨……生产上的种种混乱的结果是计划完不成，企业财政枯竭，银行欠款达到四百六十万元，去年上半年仅利息就付了近十七万元。
    当时，工厂是“四面楚歌”：用户纷纷来信，对产品质量提出责问，上级和社会舆论对工厂长期完不成计划提出批评，厂里的职工们以在锅炉厂工作而引为羞耻，有的工人走到厂外就把证章摘下来放进口袋里。
    就在这种情况下，厂的领导上按照第一机械工业部和中共上海市委的指示，组织全厂干部对如何整顿企业的问题展开了热烈的讨论。讨论最后集中在一个焦点上：生产上的混乱是从那里发源的呢？
    混乱从何而来？
    造成上海锅炉厂生产混乱的根本原因，是企业领导工作中存在着严重的脱离实际的主观主义作风。
    上海锅炉厂从1952年起就开始搞计划管理，为什么生产秩序始终不能建立呢？原来他们的一套计划管理制度不是同本厂的实际相结合，而是从一般机械工厂里原套搬来的。例如，工厂金属结构车间按照沈阳机械三厂的办法推行了“一序一票”制度（即一道工序记一张工作票），可是这个车间的冷作活都非常简单，冲一下，剪一刀，不到一分钟就是一道工序。“一序一票”制度推行的结果，忙得工人来不及记票，只好一把把地塞在口袋里，下班时就把一大堆票堆在记工员面前。硬搬这种制度的结果反而影响了生产。又例如，他们曾按照一般厂的经验，推行了制订个人作业计划的制度，但火工车间是以一个组来合作工作的，只能订组的计划而不可能订个人计划，推行的结果反而使组内的工人闹不团结。
    脱离实际的主观主义在另一方面的表现是领导工作严重的一般化。他们执行上级指示是坚决的，但常常不结合企业具体情况进行研究。部和局布置了一年或一季的工作以后，厂里就几乎不作什么修改地把这些文件翻印出来，作为本厂的工作计划。他们的计划，如果说有特点，它的特点就是一般化，看不出本厂的具体矛盾，看不出一定时期的中心，看不出这些工作的具体执行办法，也根本无法检查。这个季度和那个季度，上个月和下个月，只要改一下数目字就可以用。他们把这种计划叫做“教条主义的标准计划”，因为上边所列的条文似乎都正确，就是不能具体地用来指导工作。
    摸准特点
    在检查了过去的主观主义作风之后，上海锅炉厂领导上意识到想结束混乱，组织好生产，就一定要从企业的具体情况出发，也就是说要对准锅炉生产的特点出发。
    锅炉厂有它不同于其他机械厂的许多特点。例如锅炉生产必须同用户及电站设计单位密切联系，它要根据发电站的布局与当地不同的自然条件，来进行生产。另外，锅炉是一套联合设备，很多部件都要其他专业厂协作。因此，锅炉厂的生产要搞好，必须密切同使用单位和协作厂的联系。但是，过去他们却没有根据这个特点来建立相应的组织与制度。协作工厂的联系只作为供应科的一项附带任务。以后，当他们真正抓住了这个生产上的“骨节眼”的时候，效果就与过去截然不同了。
    这里我举下边两件事说一说。
    锅炉生产的特点之一是：产品组件多，零件复杂（共有十一万多个零件）。根据这个特点，在组织生产中就一定要重视扩大组件零件的通用化、标准化的工作，以便在单个小批生产中尽量利用成批生产的优点（锅炉组件零件有很大部分是可以通用化和标准化的）。这就是说，如果能够有一半组件零件做成通用件和标准件，工作量就可以减少一半。这个锅炉生产中的关键问题过去却完全没有引起他们注意，每台锅炉都是全部单独进行设计和制造的，不知浪费了多少人力和物力。现在，他们已把这个工作摆在最重要的位置上，逐步扩大组件零件的通用化，实现成批生产，使得全厂各个生产环节上都大大地松了一口气。
    原材料也是锅炉生产中的重大问题。锅炉生产中材料规格、种类多，耗费量大，它占生产成本的70％以上。这个重要部分，过去也被放松了，材料的严重浪费造成了生产成本的高昂。现在他们在不影响质量的前提下简化了材料规格，将原来的四百二十一种简化为二百四十种，减少了材料的浪费，提高了工作效率，也降低了成本。
    他们就这样从企业的具体情况出发，坚决地进行了若干应兴应革的工作，这些工作都被列入了生产技术组织措施计划，动员全体职工来做。领导上定期检查，按月总结，生产秩序开始建立起来，一匹脱缰的野马终于被驯服住了。
    压缩蹲办公室的时间
    在批判主观主义作风的时候，锅炉厂领导上又同事务主义进行了斗争。过去他们的主观主义同事务主义、文牍主义是纠缠在一起的。浮在上边的时间过多，忙着开会，发文件，整天在会议和争吵中过日子，把各科室、车间的干部也都拖上来整天泡在会议里。他们曾经在七十七天里开过二百五十三次会，每天平均三次以上，真是开得昏头转向，哪里还有时间去解决生产中的各种具体问题呢？
    从去年下半年起，他们明确了厂级领导的分工，确定了几种定期的会议，坚决压缩一切可有可无的会议，提倡干部多深入群众，具体安排工作，组织检查。当经常下去接触群众之后，头脑就清醒得多了，消息也灵通了。举一个小的例子，前几天台风从上海过境，厂里有十七户工人的住宅屋顶被风揭了，有一百零八户工人需要临时救济。领导干部因为经常在下面跑，很快就弄清了这件事，让损坏了房屋的工人搬进了工人宿舍，对困难的进行了救济。这样，不等工人们找上门来，就把问题解决了。
    当然，到群众中去，不能是无目的的。他们除了每天有一定时间下车间以外，主要是有计划有组织地下去，帮助车间解决问题。譬如金属结构车间过去一直很落后，成为全厂生产上的一个薄弱环节，而它的产值最大，对全厂生产任务的完成影响很大。他们便由厂长、总工程师带头组织科室人员，帮助车间具体研究生产落后的原因，前后花了两个多月时间，终于找出了病根，扭转了混乱局面。这个车间在今年五月份已突破了本厂1959年计划达到的水平，成了一个先进车间。
    工作生气勃勃了
    到群众中去的最重要任务就是总结和推广先进经验。今年二月间，上海锅炉厂组织了一次成功的推广同工种先进经验的工作，把全厂反对主观主义的斗争又推进了一步。
    他们在过去也推广过先进经验，而且还搞得很热火，每一个时期最流行的先进经验，都派人去学。但是结果都是一阵风似地过去了，收效不大。是什么原因呢？原因就在于指导工作的依然是主观主义、形式主义的作风，推广先进经验与实际生产需要脱节，与群众生产经验脱节。生产中究竟有那些薄弱环节要推广先进经验、群众中有些什么好的经验？心中无数。
    今年他们坚决改变了过去的做法，研究了生产中有些什么薄弱环节？然后深入下去总结群众的创造。当他们面向群众去寻找办法的时候，他们的眼界打开了，信心增强了，工人中间有着多少诸葛亮呵！钻工不够一直是他们生产中的威胁，但钻工中间却有着一个三年不出机床事故的李福祥，有着二年多来工作效率一直比别人高好几倍的丘生根。许多生产薄弱部分，都有着这样的英雄。他们用召开同工种会议的方法，首先总结了钻工李福祥、丘生根等人的二十四条经验，这些经验推广以后，钻工效率普遍提高了一倍以上，这个长期以来影响着生产的薄弱环节终于解决了。接着又在全厂二十四个主要工种中，都召开了经验交流会，总结出了土生土长的经验242条，现在已经推广了一百四十条，工作效率普遍提高50％或一倍。
    在推广先进经验中，他们也注意学习外来经验，但不再像过去那样盲目照搬，而是根据实际需要来学。刨工一直是比较落后的工种，这次就在刨工中推广了兄弟厂奇妙刨刀的经验。他们一共推广了九条苏联的和兄弟厂的先进经验。
    当他们开始克服了主观主义和形式主义，用正确的方法组织推广先进经验的时候，领导和群众的联系空前地密切了，生产工作变得生气勃勃，再不愁没有办法了。
    全厂大团结
    使上海锅炉厂逐步摆脱落后的，还有一个最重要的动力，这就是团结，全厂的团结。
    厂的领导干部和党委会内部的团结是全厂团结的核心。上海锅炉厂过去的领导干部不够团结，妨碍了党的集体领导作用的发挥，这是造成企业长期落后的一个重要原因。现在，他们已以党的集体领导代替了一长制，在党委会的集体领导之下，统一思想、统一力量、统一步骤，一切重大问题由党委会集体讨论，及时总结和检查，开展批评与自我批评。在正常的民主生活中党委会成员建立了巩固的团结。
    在改造企业的同时，他们还进行了许多了解人、关心人的工作。领导干部都曾经到车间、宿舍，去了解工人的疾苦，给他们解决了一些生活上的困难。实行了奖励制度，今年上半年就有7，457人次得了奖。另外还在职工中评过两次级，近一千五百名职工升了级。在做人的工作中，他们特别注意了干部的工作，一年中大胆地提拔了258名优秀干部去担任领导工作。过去，厂的领导上对犯错误的干部和职工常常采取简单化的办法，批评处分过多。这次他们根据这些人的改进程度，撤销了六十一个人的处分。
    这些措施的结果就是全厂职工更好地团结到党的周围来了，先进队伍随着扩大了，去年第四季度全厂只有先进、优秀工作者504名，今年第二季度已增加到1，123名，还出现了数十个先进集体。
    现在的一切情况，和一年前相比正好翻了一个身。反对主观主义斗争的胜利，使上海锅炉厂的工作推进到了一个新的高度。
