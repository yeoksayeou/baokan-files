　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 25th: Anhui Province has completed the transplanting of over ten million mu of double-season late rice. In the fields along both banks of the Yangtze River and the Huainan area, where early rice was just harvested, there is now a new green landscape. At present, farmers in various places are busy weeding, eliminating pests, and applying fertilizer to the late rice in an effort to achieve a bumper harvest.

　　Extensive planting of double-season rice is one of the important measures taken by Anhui Province this year to increase grain production. The more than nine million mu of early rice that has been harvested has yielded a bumper harvest, with a total output of approximately 4 billion jin. In order to plant late rice in a timely manner, agricultural cooperatives in various places divided their labor into three teams for rushing the harvest, rushing plowing, and rushing planting, which solved the difficulty of insufficient labor for harvesting and transplanting. Because agricultural cooperatives in various places universally used methods such as seminars, field demonstrations, and short-term training classes to exchange and impart the experience of planting late rice before transplanting, this year's late rice was planted steadily, deeply, and evenly.

    安徽双季晚稻栽秧完毕
    新华社合肥25日电　安徽省的一千多万亩双季晚稻已经栽种完毕。在刚收完早稻不久的长江两岸和淮南地区的田野里又是一片新绿。现在，各地农民正忙着给晚稻耘草、灭虫、追肥，争取丰收。
    大量种植双季稻，是安徽省今年增产粮食的重要措施之一。已收割完了的九百多万亩早稻获得了丰收，总产量达四十亿斤左右。为了适时栽下晚稻，各地农业社把人力分为抢收、抢犁、抢栽三套班子，解决了收割和栽秧劳力不足的困难。由于各地农业社在栽秧前普遍用座谈会、田头表演、举办短期训练班等方式交流和传授了栽晚稻的经验，今年晚稻栽得又稳、又深、又匀。
