The Sorrow of "Work Reports"
　　Zhou Anrang

One afternoon, on a desk in the office of the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee, lay a draft of a work report issued by the Prefectural Committee to various county committees. Beside it, reports sent by the various counties lay scattered. The person reading the reports sat at the desk, seemingly lost in thought or perhaps simply dazed. Suddenly, the work report let out a long sigh, causing the reports beside it to become puzzled. Report A asked with concern, "What is it? Why are you sighing so deeply?" The work report quietly pointed to the person reading the reports and said, "Didn't you hear what he said? After reading you all, he said with disappointment: 'All are just copies!' Imagine, his expression and his words make me so sad!" Hearing this, the reports were truly bewildered because they were all thinking about something else entirely. Report B said, half explaining and half questioning, "He was actually praising us! He said we are like you, which actually means he thinks you are very successful as a report. That's the truth. In May, after your comrades rushed from the Prefectural Committee to the County Committees, we were born in your image within two months, like a large group of your children. This should be a cause for celebration! What is there to be sad about?"

These words revealed the innermost thoughts of the reports, and they all rushed to express to the work report how much they resembled it. Report C said, "I am the most like you. My head, my torso, my feet, all resemble you. We all specifically discuss the issue of agricultural cooperatives organizing and allocating labor. You sing a three-part song: the first part sings of achievements and problems, the second part sings of the causes of the problems, and the third part sings of future opinions. I also sing a three-part song. I can be considered your direct descendant, right?" Report D said, "I am your true son. Not only does my appearance resemble yours, but also my internal organs are exactly the same. You said that there are three problems with the allocation of labor in agricultural cooperatives: first, short-term arrangements are not well-organized; second, the principle of 'to each according to his work' is not fully implemented in the evaluation; and third, labor quotas are unreasonable. I am the same way, even the order is exactly the same as yours!" Report E said, "I am the most like you. You analyzed the causes of the problems: objectively, it's because the cooperatives are newly established, and the cadres' experience cannot keep up, and the masses are not yet accustomed to collective operation; subjectively, it's because the branch leadership is generally superficial, not specific, and not in-depth. I also analyzed it this way, not a single word different from you! Truly, like father, like son."... The reports argued incessantly, making the work report's head spin. It begged everyone, "Stop arguing! I know you all resemble me, and that's why I am sad! It would be so much better if none of you resembled me."

At this point, the reports became even more bewildered, and they all begged the work report to explain its meaning more clearly. The work report explained everything in detail: "Brothers, during the spring plowing this year, the Prefectural Committee sent a work team to Taiping Township in Xinjin County, the earliest area in the entire district to start the season, to inspect the labor organization and allocation in two agricultural cooperatives. They discovered many problems and, by helping these two cooperatives arrange labor, put forward opinions for future work. I was born under these circumstances. At that time, although I was just an ordinary report, the Prefectural Committee believed that the problems discovered were universal and could guide the work. Therefore, they added comments to me, printed me as a work report, and sent me to the various counties. In the comments, the Prefectural Committee proposed that the counties should quickly organize cadres to go deep into the production teams to discover problems and provide specific assistance in solving them. They specifically wrote, 'The above opinions should be discussed by the various county committees, quickly implemented in practical work, and the county committees are expected to report the discussion and implementation to the Prefectural Committee.' They truly hoped that I, this work report, could effectively guide the work, help the counties go deep into reality, connect with the masses, discover problems, and solve problems. Who would have thought that spring plowing has long passed, and the autumn harvest season has already arrived, and you have only slowly arrived here, and from you, I cannot see the results of implementing the Prefectural Committee's instructions. You have merely made copies of me, changing a few names and numbers. In this way, I, as a work report, have not completed my task and have wasted my efforts. And you have grown into this appearance that others already have, how can you be considered work reports!" After hearing these words, although the reports understood a little, they seemed unwilling to show weakness. Before, they were competing to say they were exactly the same as the report, but now they were competing to say that they were still different from the report after all. Some said, "My name is different from yours"; some said, "My numbers are different from yours"; some said, "My order is also somewhat different from yours"; some said, "The examples I used are different from yours"; some said, "You wrote that the main recipient is the County Committee and reported to the Provincial Committee, but I wrote that the main recipient is the Township Branch and reported to the Prefectural Committee!" The work report impatiently interrupted them and said, "Enough! In the end, you are all copied from my framework. The problem lies here: This year is the first autumn harvest after collectivization, and the organization and allocation of labor in agricultural cooperatives requires a high degree of planning and careful organization. Currently, there is a great need for good reports on how to do a good job in organizing and allocating labor, or comprehensive reports from the entire district on this aspect, to be circulated to guide more than 10,000 cooperatives in doing a good job in the autumn harvest and planting. But there is no way to summarize you, nor is there a way to choose one of you to report. How much loss will the work suffer!" After the work report finished speaking, it sighed again. At this time, the arrogant reports all became dejected. No one knew which report quietly asked, "Whose fault is this after all?" The work report said, "To understand this question, you must first see how you came into being?" The reports knew that their growth process was similar, so they elected Report Ren to answer this question as a representative. Report Ren said, "I was written by the director of the office. After receiving the Prefectural Committee's report, he casually glanced at it and said: 'These situations are the same for us.' Then he threw you into the drawer and ignored it. Later, the Prefectural Committee called several times to urge him. Only then did he send someone to the countryside to find a few examples, put them into your framework, and I grew into this appearance. Is this my fault? I was originally just a blank sheet of paper. Writing in red or writing in black, it all depends on the director's pen! I really don't understand, why did our director do this?" The work report said, "It turns out that your director (minister or cadre) has hooked up with Party jargon. Speaking of that harmful Party jargon, more than 20 years ago, Chairman Mao announced its eight major crimes, calling on everyone to abandon it and eliminate it, but more than 20 years later, it is still at large. In practical work, it is not that there is nothing to write about, but that the person writing the report does not go deep into reality, so he has to rely on Party jargon to make a living. Isn't this the most regrettable thing!" When the reports heard that it made sense, they all chimed in to prove it, saying, "That's exactly right. After collectivization, many agricultural cooperatives have gained some experience in arranging labor, but no one has helped to summarize it. It is naturally difficult to write such reports. When they pick up a pen, their minds are empty, and they have nothing to say. Apart from asking Party jargon for help, what other way is there?" Then, there was a period of painful silence.

During the conversation between the work report and the reports, the person reading the reports reread each report from scratch. In the end, he gained nothing, so he had no choice but to put them into the "retain" files. The work report was still placed in the "file" folder. Only it could be heard constantly sighing.

    “工作通报”的悲哀
    周安让
    一天下午，在中共温江地委办公室里的一张办公桌上，躺着一份地委印发给各县委的工作通报底稿，它的旁边横七竖八的睡着各县送来的报告。看报告的人坐在桌旁，像在沉思又像在发楞。忽然，工作通报长叹了一声，旁边的报告们不禁困惑起来。甲报告关心地问：“怎么？你为什么长吁短叹呢！”工作通报悄悄指着看报告的人说：“难道你没听见他的话么！刚才他看完你们以后，不是很失望地说：‘全是依样画葫芦’么！你想，他的脸色和他的话使得我多么伤心呀！”报告们听了这番话，真有些莫名其妙，因为它们想的全是另外一回事。乙报告半解释半询问地说：“他说的全是好话呀！他说我们像你，实际上就是说你当通报很成功。事实就是这样，五月间，你的伙伴们从地委赶到县委后，两个月当中，我们就比着你的样子诞生了，活像你的一大群儿女，这是应该高兴的事情呀！有什么可悲哀的呢？
    这几句话道破了众报告的心事，它们都争着对工作通报表白自己多么像它。丙报告说：“我最像你，头像、腰身像、脚也像，我们都是专门谈农业社组织调配劳动力的问题的。你唱的是三部曲，头段唱成绩和问题，二段唱产生问题的原因，三段唱今后意见。我也是唱的三部曲，总算得上是你的嫡亲儿子吧！”丁报告说：“我才是你的亲生儿子呀，不光长的样子像你，就是五脏六腑也都像你，你说农业社调配劳力存在三个问题：一是短安排没有搞好；二是评分没有贯彻按劳计酬原则；三是劳动定额不合理。我也是这样，连先后次序都和你一模一样呀！”戊报告说：“还是我顶像你，你分析产生问题的原因：客观上是建社不久，干部经验赶不上，群众一时还不习惯集体经营；主观上是支部领导一般化，不具体、不深入。我也是这么分析的，和你一字不差呀！真是有其父必有其子。”……众报告七嘴八舌地争个不停，把工作通报的头也吵昏了，它央告大家说：“别吵了吧！我知道你们全都像我，就因为这个，我才悲哀呀！要是你们都不像我，那多好。”
    这时，报告们更加莫名其妙起来，大家都恳求工作通报把它的意思说得明白些。工作通报就一五一十地解释了：“弟兄们，今年春耕的时候，地委派出工作组到全专区季节最早的新津县太平乡检查了两个农业社的劳力组织调配工作，发现了好些问题，并通过帮助这两个社安排劳力，对今后工作提出了意见，我就是在这种情况下产生的。那时我虽是一个普通报告，可是地委认为检查发现的问题是带有普遍性的，能指导工作，便给我加上批语，印成工作通报发往各县。地委在批语中提出各县应迅速组织干部深入生产队发现问题和具体帮助解决问题的意见，并特别写明“以上意见，请各县委加以讨论，迅速贯彻到实际工作中去，并望各县委将讨论与贯彻情况报告地委”，实指望我这个通报切实能起指导工作的作用，帮助各县深入实际，联系群众，发现问题，解决问题。哪晓得春耕早已过去，秋收季节已经到来，你们才慢不腾腾地来到这里，而且从你们身上又看不出贯彻地委指示的结果，只不过依样画葫芦地把我翻了版，改上几个名称和数字吧了。这么一来，我当工作通报并未完成任务，算是白费了心血，而你们长成这副别人早已有了的相貌，哪能当得上工作通报呢！”报告们听了这番话，虽然心上已有几分明白，但似乎又都不肯示弱。原来是争着说自己和通报一模一样，现在又争着说自己和通报终久还有差别了。有的说：“我的姓名和你不同呀”；有的说：“我的数目字和你不同呀”；有的说：“我的先后次序和你也有些差别呀”；有的说：“我用的例子和你不一样呀”；有的说：“你写的是主送县委并报省委，我写的却是主送乡支部并报地委呀！”工作通报不耐烦地打断它们的话说：“得啦！归根结底，你们都是照我的框子套下来的。问题就在这里，今年是合作化以后第一个秋收，农业社的组织调配劳力工作更需要高度的计划性和周密的组织性，目前很需要有关作好劳力组织调配工作的好报告或全专区关于这方面的综合报告通报下去，指导一万多个社作好秋收秋种工作，可是既没法综合你们，也没法从你们当中选出一个来通报，工作将受到多大的损失呀！”工作通报说完话，又长叹起来。这时，趾高气扬的报告们都变得垂头丧气了，不知是哪一个报告悄悄地问了一句：“这究竟是谁的过错呢？”工作通报说：“要明白这个问题，先得看看你们是怎样产生出来的？”众报告知道彼此的成长过程都差不多，便推选壬报告当代表回答这个问题。壬报告说：“我是由办公室主任写的，他在接到地委通报后，随便看了一下就说：这些情况我们也一样，于是把你丢进抽屉，不闻不问了。以后地委来电话催了几次，他才派人下乡找了几个例子，比着你的框子一装，我就长成了这个样子。难道这是我的过错吗！我最初只是一张白纸，写红写黑，全凭主任的笔呀！我真不明白，我们主任为什么要这么干？”工作通报说：“原来是你们主任（部长或干事）和党八股勾搭上了。提起那害人的党八股呀，二十多年前毛主席就宣布了它的八大罪状，号召大家抛弃它、消灭它，可是二十多年后的今天，它仍然逍遥法外。实际工作中并不是没有可写的东西，而是写报告的人不深入实际，只好凭着党八股吃饭，难道这不是顶可悲哀的事情么！”众报告一听说得有理，都异口同声地证明说：“说得一点不差，好多农业社在合作化以后，安排劳力都有了一些经验，可是没有人去帮助总结，要写这样的报告自然就困难了。他们提起笔来，腹内空空，言之无物，除去请党八股帮帮忙，还有什么别的法子呢？”接着，是一阵痛苦的沉默。
    在工作通报和众报告交谈的过程中，看报告的人又把每一个报告从新翻阅了一遍，最后还是一无所得，只好无可奈何地把它们夹进
  “留存”的卷宗里，工作通报仍被放到“存底”的卷宗里，只听得它还在不断地叹着气。
