    The glass man manufactured by the German Democratic Republic, which was exhibited in Beijing in October 1952, caused a sensation among tens of thousands of visitors. Now, following the glass man, the Dresden Museum has created a glass horse. This complex and meticulous scientific instrument manufacturing work was completed after years of painstaking efforts under the leadership of Professor Schwarze, Dean of the Veterinary Anatomy Institute of the University of Leipzig.
    Before manufacturing, the most important nervous system and blood vessels of the horse's whole body were first drawn, and then metal wires with a thickness of 0.25 mm were used to make arteries, veins, and nerves, and installed in the horse model. A total of 2,000 kilograms of plaster was used to make the horse model, and 50 kilograms of metal wire was used to make the entire network and nervous system of the horse.
    There are sixty-three light bulbs in the glass horse's body. As long as you press a button, the light bulbs in a certain part will light up. In this way, people can have a clear understanding of the organs in this part. At the same time, a tape recorder can also explain the structure and function of each part of the glass horse (the commentary was written by Professor Schwarze). (Attached picture)

    民主德国的玻璃马
    本报讯　1952年10月在北京展览过德意志民主共和国制造的玻璃人，曾经在成千成万的参观者中间轰动一时。现在继玻璃人之后，德累斯顿博物馆又制造成了一匹玻璃马。这项复杂细致的科学仪器制造工作，是在来比锡马克思大学兽医解剖学院院长施瓦采教授领导之下经过了多年的精心努力以后完成的。
    在制造之前，首先画出了马全身的最重要的神经系统和血管的图样，然后用0.25公厘粗的金属丝做成动脉静脉和神经，安装在马的模型内。为了制作马的模型，总共用掉了二千公斤石膏，而制作马的全部脉络和神经系统则用掉了五十公斤重的金属丝。
    在玻璃马的体内装有六十三个电灯泡。只要一按电钮，某一部分的灯泡就会亮起来。这样，人们对这一部分的器官就能了如指掌。同时，有一部录音机还能对玻璃马的各部分构造及官能进行解释（解说词是由施瓦采教授写成的）。（附图片）
