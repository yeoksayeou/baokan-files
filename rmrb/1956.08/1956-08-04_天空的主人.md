    Masters of the Sky
    Yang Zhaolin, Su Yanchang
    Thick fog lingers,
    A time to hone our skills,
    The vast expanse of the sky,
    A battlefield to establish merit!
    Every aerial route leads to victory,
    Arduous training is the guarantee of success!…
        —A poem by a naval aviation fighter

    We arrived at a naval aviation base in Zhejiang. A little over a year ago, this place was still on the front lines; Yijiangshan Island had not yet been liberated. A year later, coming here, the troops have already extended forward.

    Our car drove on winding mountain roads. In the evening, after crossing the last mountain, we finally heard the familiar sound of the sea lapping the shore, and we arrived at our destination. Stepping out of the car, the slanting wind and drizzle hit our faces, and dark clouds still pressed down on our heads. In the rain, the frogs croaked loudly, making the surroundings seem even quieter. Villages and rice paddies were shrouded in mist and rain, and not a single figure could be seen on the road. Suddenly, a sharp whistling sound rang through the air, and two jet fighters swept across the sky, followed by another group of four. The planes flew in the thin clouds, as if draped in a light veil, and in the blink of an eye, they soared straight into the high sky. We all stopped and watched the planes fly away. In this weather where "few people travel on the roads and birds stop flying in the sky," the planes still took off, which made us feel amazed.

    A year ago, we met this naval aviation unit. People said that this was a unit of "hidden dragons and crouching tigers." Some time ago, they were also commended by the Ministry of National Defense for their achievements in combat. Today, seeing them flying as usual in the rain and under complex weather conditions, we can know that they have made leaps and bounds in the past year!

    There are many familiar friends here. After meeting, we naturally talked about the combat life of the past year. A year ago, the object of their battles was still the American-made Chiang Kai-shek's F-47 propeller planes; after stationing here, the main task was to fight the F-84 jet fighters. Not long ago, even the F-84 rarely appeared in this war zone. They had already fought a few battles with the enemy's F-86 planes. Now, the enemy's planes simply avoid us when they see us. The enemy has changed aircraft types one after another in such a short period of time, from F-47 to F-84, and then to F-86, which shows what kind of battles our war eagles have fought!

    After the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, the troops immediately stationed here. The enemy constantly sent F-47 planes to reconnaissance and harass. After continuous defeats, they hurriedly put the F-84 into battle; not long after, two were shot down by us in one day. That same afternoon, another PBY plane was shot down.

    We asked the operations department for the battle report of that day. Opening the combat map, we saw that the colored pencil lines recording the combat process formed a net throughout the entire war zone. The four small red planes and the red lines they released were the meridians of this net. The four blue lines marking the enemy's movements were extremely irregular, and it seemed that they wanted to break out of the track at any time. First, in the center of the big net, a blue line was broken. This shows that an enemy plane was shot down here. Then, another blue line was cut off. The remaining two blue dotted lines fled towards Taiwan. This plan view does not indicate the changes in altitude, but in fact, the battle that day was conducted in the air at different altitudes.

    In this battle, what excited us even more was our aerial warriors. That day, the squadron led by Zhang Wenqing intercepted enemy planes over ××. It can be seen from the chart that the No. 1 plane he was piloting was approaching an enemy plane; the No. 3 plane piloted by Wang Hongxi was also approaching another enemy plane. Looking further ahead, Zhang Wenqing's position suddenly appeared to the right rear of the enemy plane being pursued by Wang Hongxi. The enemy plane was threatened and turned sharply to the left, at which time Wang Hongxi opened fire on the enemy plane. As a result, the first enemy plane was wiped out on the chart.

    The comrades who participated in this battle introduced to us: "Wang Hongxi fought fiercely and accurately, blowing up the enemy plane in mid-air. The enemy pilot just threw away the cockpit cover and hadn't jumped out yet, and he turned into fragments with the plane." He pointed to the sudden change in Zhang Wenqing's position and said: "You see, as soon as Wang Hongxi entered the attack, Zhang Wenqing immediately took the initiative to take a feigned attack. The enemy was frightened. With a turn, a large area was vacated, and he honestly received a 'reward.' Then, Zhang Wenqing himself also hit an enemy plane. They cooperated so well!"

    We went to visit Wang Kun, who is famous for his bravery and skill in combat. Before being transferred to the East China front, he once shot down and damaged one enemy F-86 plane each. In a battle over the East China Sea, he led his team and fought the enemy all the way to a low altitude of forty or fifty meters. The enemy flew low and circled to dodge, and Wang Kun fought close to the sea surface, making seven attacks, and finally shot down the enemy plane. When he disengaged from the battle and raised his plane with his head held high, the airflow spewing from the tail blew a big hole in the seawater. After that, he participated in the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialist Construction for Young People.

    What words can you use to praise such a brave person? Can you imagine how much effort and how much painstaking effort they spent to master such combat skills.

    We visited Colonel Li Wenmo of the Navy, the commander of the unit. The colonel deserves the title of "Eagle." He once grew up on the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. Now, he is flying in the vast sky again, leading an entire flock of eagles to fight. We talked to him about the impression we got from visiting the troops this time. He said modestly: "No, we didn't fight well. In the past period, we shouldn't have only shot down ×× enemy planes, it should be more than this number!"

    After we raised the question, the colonel cited many vivid materials and mentioned many people's names, and those comrades who fought well were also the best comrades in training. From the colonel's answer, we learned that our pilots have a firm sense of professionalism. For the needs of the Party and the people, they strive to improve and engage in arduous labor. They have improved their skills through thousands of flights. Isn't it quite natural for such conscious soldiers to become excellent hunters in the sky!

    At this moment, a thunderous sound suddenly rang in the sky. The colonel strode to the window, opened the window, and a night flight plane flashed across the sky outside the window. A beam of light suddenly rose from the ground. With the searchlight, it could be seen very clearly that it was still raining.

    Not long ago, the enemy was still saying that we "take holidays when it rains and rest at night." Now we have to see who is hiding in the nest and dare not move!

    天空的主人
    杨肇林  苏延昌
    大雾迷漫，
    是锻炼本领的时光，
    万里长空，
    是建立功勋的战场！
    每一条空中道路都通向胜利，
    艰苦的锻炼是成功的保障！……
        ——海军航空兵战士的诗
    我们来到浙江的一个海军航空基地。一年多以前，这里还是前线，一江山岛还没有解放。一年后来到这里，部队已经向前伸展了。
    我们的汽车走在盘旋的山路上。傍晚，翻过最后一座大山，终于听到了那亲切的海涛拍岸的声音，我们来到目的地了。跨出汽车，斜风细雨迎面扑来，乌云仍然压着头顶。雨中，青蛙鼓噪得厉害，显得四外更加寂静。村庄和稻田都笼罩在烟雨雾气之中，路上一个人影也看不见。突然，空中响起尖锐的啸声，两架喷气歼击机掠过天空，接着又飞过一批四架。飞机飞在薄云里，像是披着一身轻纱，转眼直向高空冲去。我们都停下来，看着飞机远去。在这“路上少行人，天上停飞鸟”的天气里，飞机仍然出航，不禁使我们感到惊异。
    一年以前，我们就结识了这支海军航空兵部队。人们都说这是一支“藏龙卧虎”的部队，前些日子，他们还因为作战有成绩，受到了国防部的嘉奖。今天看到他们在雨中，在复杂气象条件下照常飞行，就可知道他们在这一年中，又有了飞跃的进步！
    这里有许多熟悉的朋友。见面之后，很自然地谈起这一年来的战斗生活。一年以前，他们战斗的对象还是美制蒋军F—47型螺旋桨飞机；进驻此地后，主要任务便是打F—84喷气战斗机了。不久以前，连F—84也很少在这一战区出现。他们和敌人的F—86型飞机已经干了几场。现在，敌人的飞机干脆看见我们就躲避。敌人在这样短的时间里，由F—47，换F—84，再换F—86，接连地更换机种，可以看出我们的战鹰曾经进行了怎样的战斗！
    一江山岛解放后，部队立即进驻此地。敌人不断派出F—47型飞机侦察、骚扰。他们在连续失利后，慌忙又把F—84投入战斗；不久，在一天当中就被我敲掉了两架。同天下午，又打落他一架PBY型飞机。
    我们从作战部门要来了那一天的战报。打开作战标图，只见记载着战斗过程的彩色铅笔线，在整个战区组成了一张网。四架红色小飞机和它们放出的红线，是这张网的经络。标志着敌机行动的四条蓝线，则极不规则，看来它们时时想越轨冲出。先是在大网的中央，有一条蓝线断了。这说明，一架敌机在这里被击落下去。接着，又一条蓝线被掐断。剩下两条蓝色虚线，就向台湾方向逃去。在这张平面图上，并没有标出高低变化，而实际上，当天的战斗是在不同高度的空中进行的。
    在这一场战斗中，更使我们激动的是我们的空中战士。那天，由张文清带领的机队，在××上空截住了敌机。从标图上看出，他驾驶的一号飞机已经逼近一架敌机；由王洪喜驾驶的三号飞机也逼近了另一架敌机。再向前看去，张文清的位置突然出现在被王洪喜追逼的那架敌机的右后方，敌机受到威胁，急向左转弯，这时王洪喜就向敌机开炮。于是，标图上抹掉了第一架敌机。
    参加这次战斗的同志向我们介绍：“王洪喜打得狠，也十分准，把敌机打了个当空爆炸。敌机飞行员刚刚抛掉座舱盖，还没有跳出来，就跟着飞机化成碎片了。”他又指着张文清那突然变换的位置说：“你们看，王洪喜一进入攻击，张文清立即主动采取佯攻，敌人吓蒙了，一转弯，就空出一大块面积，老老实实饱受了一顿‘赏赐’。跟着，张文清自己也打中了一架敌机。他们配合得太好了！”
    我们去访问以勇敢善战著名的王坤。他在调到东海前线来以前，曾经一次击落、击伤敌机F—86各一架。在东海上空的一次战斗中，他带队和敌人一直打到四五十公尺高的低空。敌人低飞盘旋躲闪，王坤贴近海面作战，进行了七次攻击，最后把敌机打落下去。当他脱离战斗，昂首拉起飞机的时候，从尾部喷出的气流把海水冲开一个大洞。以后，他就参加了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子代表大会。
    对于这样勇敢的人，你能用什么言语来赞扬呢？你能想像得出他们花了多少功夫，多少心血，使自己掌握这样的作战本领。
    我们拜访了部队长李文模海军上校。上校可以当得起“雄鹰”的称号，他曾经在雪山草地上锻炼成长，如今，他又飞行在万里长空，领着一整个鹰群战斗。我们和他谈起这次来部队所得的印象，他谦虚地说：“不，我们的仗没有打好，过去一段时间里，不应该只是打下××架敌机，应该大于这个数目！”
    在我们提出问题以后，上校列举了许多生动的材料，提到了许多人的名字，而那些战斗得好的同志，也都是训练中最好的同志。从上校的回答中，我们知道了，我们的飞行员都有坚定的事业心，为了党和人民的需要，他们力求上进，从事艰苦的劳动，他们经过千百次的飞行，提高了本领。这样一些自觉的战士，成为天空中的优秀猎手，不是十分自然的么！
    这时，天空忽然响起了春雷一般的声音。上校几步迈到窗前，推开窗门，夜航飞机在窗外天空中闪过。从地面陡地竖起了一条光柱，借着探照灯光，看得很清楚，雨还在下着。
    不久以前，敌人还在说我们“下雨放假，夜晚休息”，现在倒要看看谁爬在窝里不敢动弹了！
