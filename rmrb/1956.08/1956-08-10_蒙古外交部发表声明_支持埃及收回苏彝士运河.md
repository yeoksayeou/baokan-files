    Mongolian Foreign Ministry Issues Statement
    Supporting Egypt's Reclamation of the Suez Canal
    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Ulan Bator dispatch: The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published on August 8th a statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic regarding the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The statement said that the Egyptian government's decision on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is completely legal and is made according to Egypt's sovereignty. Therefore, this decision is warmly supported by the Mongolian people and their government.
    The statement pointed out that certain Western countries are trying in every possible way to put pressure on the Egyptian government, attempting to force it to retract this decision, which is of extremely great significance for the further development of the Egyptian economy. This pressure is in fact equivalent to a rude interference in the internal affairs of independent Egypt.
    The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic emphasized that the declaration by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company threatens the freedom and security of navigation through the canal is unfounded.

    蒙古外交部发表声明
    支持埃及收回苏彝士运河
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社乌兰巴托讯：蒙古“真理报”八月八日刊登了蒙古人民共和国外交部发言人就埃及政府把苏彝士运河收归国有一事发表的声明。声明说，埃及政府关于苏彝士运河公司国有化的决定是完全合法的，是根据埃及的主权作出的。因此，这一决定受到蒙古人民和他们的政府的热烈支持。
    声明指出，某些西方国家千方百计地对埃及政府施加压力，企图使它收回这一对埃及经济的进一步发展有极其重大意义的决定。这种压力实际上等于粗暴地干涉自主的埃及的内政。
    蒙古人民共和国外交部发言人着重指出，美、英、法三国外交部长关于苏彝士运河公司国有化威胁运河通航的自由和安全的声明，是没有任何根据的。
