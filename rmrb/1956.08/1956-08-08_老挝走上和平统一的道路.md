    Laos Embarks on the Road to Peaceful Unification

    The talks between the delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the delegation of the Lao Fighting Units, which began on August 1 in Vientiane, reached an agreement on the 5th. In the joint communique, both sides announced that Laos would pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. The two sides have determined the principles for resolving or seeking solutions to the various issues of ceasing all hostilities and achieving a political settlement. These agreements have laid a good foundation for consolidating peace and independence in Laos and realizing the democratic unification of Laos. At the same time, they have made a significant contribution to easing the situation in Indochina and promoting the full implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Indochina.
    The unanimous declaration by both the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units in favor of a policy of peace and neutrality is of great significance. As everyone knows, the Geneva Agreements were reached on the basis of respecting the independence and unification of the Indochinese countries and guaranteeing the peaceful and neutral status of the Indochinese countries. The Geneva Agreements have already been fully implemented in Cambodia. The resolute pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality by Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Cambodian Government has won the full sympathy, praise, and support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, thereby strengthening Cambodia's national independence, enhancing its international status, and increasing its role in resolving international affairs. Prior to this meeting, both the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units had expressed their sincerity in complying with the Geneva Agreements and endorsed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Now, the two sides have joined hands to strive for the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality, and to jointly safeguard the clauses stipulated in the Geneva Agreements such as not participating in any military alliance and not allowing the establishment of foreign military bases on Lao territory. This will reliably guarantee the independence and neutral status of Laos and will be conducive to peace in Asia. It is believable that, on the basis of pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, Laos's international status will improve daily, and its domestic unity will be greatly strengthened.
    The various principles and methods stipulated in the agreement between the two sides regarding the cessation of hostilities and the achievement of a political settlement are in line with the spirit of the Geneva Agreements and the aspirations of the entire Lao people. The two sides agreed that, pending a political settlement, all hostilities would cease in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and it was stipulated that the troops of both sides would be stationed in their current locations and that no increase in troops or weapons would be allowed. This is an important agreement leading to further negotiated solutions to the Lao problem. The main purpose of the Geneva Agreements was primarily to restore peace in Indochina. However, after the ceasefire was achieved, occasional acts of hostility still occurred between the Lao sides. This was a matter of utmost concern and anxiety for all peace-loving people, and it was also a matter of great distress to the Lao people. All those who care about peace in Indochina hope that, through the agreement reached at this meeting, both sides in Laos will avoid taking actions that are detrimental to peace and avoid military conflicts, no matter what the circumstances may be in the future. Only in this way can the smooth realization of a political settlement be guaranteed.
    In order to restore the democratic unification of Laos, the Royal Lao Government expressed its guarantee to respect the democratic freedom rights of all Lao people and the right of various political organizations to conduct legal activities, and guaranteed that the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel would not be treated differently. These are important clauses stipulated in the Geneva Agreements as prerequisites for achieving the democratic unification of Laos. Now, the two sides have reaffirmed these clauses in the talks and have stipulated some specific measures to guarantee their realization. This is entirely necessary. The two sides have also reached agreements on the issues of the organization of political power in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly and the status of the Lao Fighting Units. Naturally, the issues of universal suffrage and the establishment of a coalition government have not yet been fully resolved, and the two sides are continuing to negotiate on these issues. However, we believe that as long as both sides continue to work hard, there is no reason why these two issues cannot be resolved reasonably.
    Both the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units showed a sincere desire for reconciliation in this meeting and made great efforts. The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos also made a significant contribution to assisting in holding this meeting. The achievements made through the effective efforts of all parties concerned prove that as long as everyone has the sincerity and desire to resolve problems through consultation, and the negotiating parties adopt an attitude of mutual respect and mutual tolerance and compromise, all issues related to the implementation of the Geneva Agreements can be agreed upon.
    The Chinese people and all countries and peoples who uphold the Geneva Agreements and care about peace in Indochina express great satisfaction with the achievements of the Lao bilateral talks and will give resolute support to the various agreements they have reached for the implementation of the Geneva Agreements. We sincerely hope that the Lao parties will continue to move forward on the road to peaceful unification on the basis of the achievements made in this meeting, so that Laos can soon play its role in the international family of the Asian peace region as a fully independent and unified country, and promote the full implementation of the Geneva Agreements in all Indochinese countries with their good example of conducting consultations.

    老挝走上和平统一的道路
    老挝王国政府代表团和寮国战斗部队代表团从八月一日开始在万象举行的会谈，已在五日达成了协议。双方在联合公报中宣布，老挝将奉行和平中立政策；双方对于停止一切敌对行动和实现政治解决的各项问题，已确定了解决的原则或求得解决的途径。这些协议为巩固老挝的和平和独立、实现老挝的民主统一打下了良好的基础，同时也为和缓印度支那的局势，促进日内瓦协议在印度支那的全部实施作出了重大的贡献。
    老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方一致宣布赞成和平中立政策，这具有非常重要的意义。大家知道，日内瓦协议是在尊重印度支那各国的独立和统一、保障印度支那国家的和平中立地位的基础上达成的。日内瓦协议已经在柬埔寨全部实现。西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府坚决奉行和平中立政策的结果，得到了世界爱好和平的国家和人民的充分的同情、赞扬和支持，从而使得柬埔寨国家的独立日益巩固了，国际地位提高了，在解决国际事务中所起的作用增长了。老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队在这次会谈以前，都曾表示自己具有遵守日内瓦协议的诚意，都赞成和平共处的五项原则。现在，双方携起手来，为实行和平中立政策，维护日内瓦协议所规定的不参加任何军事同盟、不许在老挝领土上建立外国军事基地等条款而共同努力，这就将使老挝的独立和中立地位得到可靠的保障，并有利于亚洲的和平。可以相信，在奉行和平中立政策的基础上，老挝的国际地位将要日见提高，它的国内团结将会大大加强。
    双方协议中关于停止敌对行动和实现政治解决所规定的各项原则和办法，都是符合日内瓦协议的精神和老挝全体人民的愿望的。双方同意，在等待政治解决的期间，在桑怒和丰沙里两省停止一切敌对行动，并且规定双方军队在原地驻扎，不得增加兵员和武器。这是导致老挝问题进一步协商解决的重要协议。日内瓦协议的主要目的，首先是为了恢复印度支那的和平。但是，在停战实现之后，老挝双方还偶尔有对敌行动发生，这是一切爱好和平人民最关心和忧虑的事，也是老挝人民所最痛心的事。一切关心印度支那和平的人们都期望，通过这次会谈所达成的协议，老挝双方今后无论遇到什么样的情况，都要避免采取不利于和平的行动，避免军事冲突。只有这样，才能保证政治解决的顺利实现。
    为了恢复老挝的民主统一，老挝王国政府表示保证尊重全体老挝人民的民主自由权利和各种政治组织进行合法活动的权利，并保证对寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员不予分别对待。这些，都是日内瓦协议中所规定了的作为实现老挝民主统一的前提条件的重要条款，现在双方在会谈中重申了这些条款，并规定了一些具体办法来保证其实现，这是完全必要的。双方对于桑怒和丰沙里两省的政权组织的问题和寮国战斗部队的地位问题，也已经取得了协议。自然，还有关于普选和成立联合政府的问题尚未完全解决，双方正在为此继续进行协商。但是，我们相信，只要双方继续努力，这两个问题是没有理由不能求得合理解决的。
    老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方在这次会谈中都表现了和解的诚意，都作了很大的努力。老挝国际监督和监察委员会对于协助举行这次会议，也作出了重大的贡献。有关各方这种有效的努力所获得的成就证明，只要大家都有协商解决问题的诚意和愿望，谈判双方采取互相尊重和互相容忍让步的态度，执行日内瓦协议的一切问题都是能够取得协议的。
    中国人民和一切维护日内瓦协议、关心印度支那和平的国家和人民，对于老挝双方会谈的成就，都表示极大的欣慰，对于他们为了执行日内瓦协议而达成的各项协议，都将给予坚决的支持。我们热诚地期望，老挝双方在这次会谈所取得的成就的基础上，继续在和平统一的道路上迈进，使得老挝早日能以一个完全独立和统一的国家的身份，在亚洲和平地区的国际大家庭中发挥它的作用，并且以他们进行协商的良好榜样，来促进日内瓦协议在印度支那各国全部实现。
