    "Teachers are the engineers of the human soul."
    "Normal education is the workhorse of education."
    These are phrases often heard since liberation. These words fully demonstrate the importance the Party and the People's Government attach to education, and also reflect the unprecedented rise in the status of the teaching profession in the era of the people.

    Not only in words, but also in action, advanced and intermediate normal schools are being established in large numbers according to plan. This gradually prepares conditions in terms of manpower and other aspects for the popularization and improvement of education in New China.

    To understand the development of normal education in New China, it is not enough to look at the surface; we must also look at the essential changes in our normal education in recent years to see how it is gradually becoming true normal education. Why do we say "true"? Because in old China, although normal education had half a century of history, it was always plagued by misfortune, and was even regarded as a thorn in the side by some academic warlords. Not only were higher normal schools once turned into ordinary universities, but even secondary normal schools were once merged into normal courses in ordinary middle schools. The purpose was to eliminate normal education, based on the theory that "as long as you have knowledge, you can be a good teacher," so there is no need to run normal education separately, and even less need to study the characteristics of normal education. Under the domination of that environment and thinking, not only were many young people unwilling to study at normal schools, but even those who ran higher normal education, in order to "strive for the top," did not hesitate to change everything about themselves to look like comprehensive universities. The way to look like them was to make the colleges, departments, and even various disciplines they set up as similar as possible to comprehensive universities, the only difference being that they had a few more education subjects. In this way, it goes without saying that the professional ideals of normal students were difficult to establish; even teachers in normal schools felt "underqualified." All these facts prove that the "normal" nature of normal education in old China was very weak.

    After liberation, the old and newly established normal colleges and schools across the country, under the guiding principle of "cultivating people's teachers who are both moral and talented and physically strong," first reflected the characteristics of normal education in the content of the teaching plans of the departments and courses established. Specifically, the teaching plan of any department or course is composed of four parts: first, political subjects; second, educational subjects; third, professional subjects; and fourth, educational practice. We can see from this that educational subjects and educational practice are listed as two components alongside professional subjects, neither as decoration nor as appendages. This first clarifies what normal education is. Not only that, but political subjects and professional subjects must be closely related to the other two components (educational subjects and educational practice), and not isolated from each other. Specifically, although there are departments and courses in normal colleges and schools with names similar to those in comprehensive universities, such as history, geography, physics, and chemistry, they are first of all different from comprehensive universities in terms of tasks. Therefore, the subjects offered in these departments and courses, as well as the teaching syllabus and teaching methods of each subject, must have some significant differences from comprehensive universities. This is because our purpose is to train teachers, not writers, painters, or other research talents; although in fact a teacher can also be a writer, painter, or research talent in some field at the same time, the two are not necessarily contradictory, but the task of normal education is to train teachers, not something else. If graduates of normal schools are not happy to be teachers or are not good at being teachers, this is a failure of normal education. Similarly, if graduates of medical colleges and schools are not interested in medicine or do not understand medicine, can they be forgiven by society?

    But the problem is not that simple. If there is only one education department in a normal college or school, and its students will all teach education subjects in the future, there is no contradiction. However, normal colleges and schools supply teachers for various subjects in middle schools and normal schools, so there are more than ten departments and courses, which creates various contradictions: First, how can you be a teacher if you don't learn professional knowledge well? Next, how should the proportion of professional subjects and educational subjects be determined? Since graduates of comprehensive universities can also be middle school teachers, and their professional level may be higher than that of normal graduates because they study less or no education subjects at all, while normal students only master some more educational knowledge and skills, will normal students be "overshadowed" in practice when compared to each other? Furthermore, normal colleges and schools train teachers for middle schools, so in order to be in line with the reality of middle schools, it is necessary to "face middle schools" in daily work. Does this hinder professional research?

    Especially after the call to "march towards science" was put forward, it implicitly aggravated the contradictions of normal education. Whether it is the mathematics department or the history department, does the "science" of marching towards science refer to their own major, or does it also include educational subjects? Is there any difference between the requirements for "associate doctors" and "doctors" in normal colleges and schools and those in comprehensive universities? For the former question, it can certainly be answered easily: "Both the major and educational science are compatible, and anything is good as long as there is achievement." But in fact, such compatibility is equivalent to developing normal colleges and schools in the direction of comprehensive universities, because teachers and students in each department and course will naturally focus on their own major, and naturally create the misfortune of despising and excluding educational subjects in normal schools.

    Don't believe it? You can take Beijing Normal University, where I am, as proof. To illustrate the problem, here is a brief historical narrative: When we formulated the teaching plans for each department in the spring of 1952 with the help of Soviet experts, there was a serious ideological struggle to eliminate certain subjects that were not needed to train middle school teachers; those who advocated retaining them believed that eliminating these subjects would lower our academic level and we would no longer be comparable to comprehensive universities. Later, when formulating the teaching syllabus for certain subjects, there were similar disputes. Although the teaching plan and teaching syllabus were reluctantly drawn up, there has always been a complaint that the proportion of professional subjects in the four components is too low. Over the years, the situation of teaching in some subjects being divorced from the reality of middle schools has been sharply reflected every time students go to middle schools for educational practice. Although many people have put a lot of effort into guiding students' practice in middle schools, another group of people regard it as a bitter task, and even some young teachers feel that guiding practice hinders their scientific research. As for scientific research, the percentage of topics with educational subjects as the theme has been very low in the past two years; if the education department is excluded, it is even lower. Some questions that should be studied first in normal universities, such as what is all-round development education, were already disputed in newspapers and magazines two years ago. Shouldn't this question be jointly studied by all departments (not just the education department) of normal universities? For example, "facing middle schools" is one of the guiding principles of normal universities, but everyone has their own understanding of what "facing middle schools" is. Shouldn't this also be systematically studied? However, these types of questions have not attracted everyone's attention. As for the specific work of "facing middle schools," some departments have done a lot successively, but most of them are passive and unplanned (such as being invited by middle schools to give reports), and very few are purposeful and systematic; and some departments have not done anything, and some teachers have nothing to do with this work. Doesn't all this prove that there are still some problems with the direction in which the car of normal university is heading? Aren't these all ideological understanding problems?

    The problem of ideological understanding will of course be solved over a long period of time, but through the recent anti-dogmatism, the above-mentioned contradictions have become more apparent, so the directional question of where normal universities should go has become even more confusing. Some people advocate reducing the other three components of the teaching plan, namely merging political subjects, reducing educational subjects, and simplifying educational practice, based on the two major reasons of "the proportion of professional subjects is too light" and "students' burden is too heavy." Leaving aside other things, just talking about educational practice, the teaching plan stipulates that there are six weeks of concentrated practice in each of the sixth and seventh semesters. From the perspective of class hours, a total of twelve weeks accounts for less than one-thirteenth (about 7.5%) of the 160 weeks of students' eight semesters at school (each semester is counted as twenty weeks). Can this be considered "much"? Not merging educational practice into educational subjects, but listing it as a separate component, not only shows the importance of combining theory with practice in normal schools, but also reflects its mutual restriction with the other three components. Everyone admits the necessity of combining theory with practice, but in reality, normal students go to middle schools for two internships (one in junior high school and one in senior high school), listen to several reports from middle school leaders and teachers, try teaching about eight lessons, do several class teacher jobs, and then write internship diaries and make internship summaries. Can this be considered "much"? Only because the internship in normal schools in the old days was treated as a routine matter before graduation, not as serious as it is today, and the old internship was limited to teaching a few lessons, while now there are evaluation meetings after class, and they also have to be class teachers, which adds a lot of trouble. Especially in the past, only teaching method teachers were responsible, but now, because there are many intern students, it is necessary to mobilize many teachers to participate. Comparing the new internship with the old internship, it seems that there are contradictions everywhere.

    Why is anti-dogmatism involved in so many problems? Because the teaching plan is based on the teaching plan of Soviet normal colleges, and educational practice is even learned from the Soviet Union. Since there are some problems in the middle, the reason falls to dogmatically learning from the Soviet Union without being able to properly combine it with China's reality. But what is the truth in fact? Still taking educational practice as an example, we have carried out nine internships, and after each one, the intern students feel that they have gained a lot. Not only have they cultivated teaching and educational skills through practice, but they have also verified and deepened the theoretical knowledge they have mastered (including their majors and educational subjects). More importantly, they have consolidated the ideological emotions of being a people's teacher. From another perspective, the vast majority of the fifty or so schools that have accepted internship tasks in recent years admit that the internship is helpful to their own business improvement; if it were just a burden and no benefit, they would not actively sign long-term mutual assistance contracts with us. Our teachers in various departments, after guiding the internship and having contact with middle schools, many people admit that it is also beneficial to the improvement of their own teaching. Of course, there are also shortcomings. The scale of the internship is getting bigger and bigger, and there are some places that are not well organized and arranged in terms of organization and requirements; and there are also difficulties, such as the incompatibility of the teaching plan and the internship (especially reflected in the biology department), one internship requires mobilizing a lot of manpower, affecting the usual teaching, etc. However, when studying these types of problems, should we proceed from the purpose and effect, or from the shortcomings and difficulties? If, because there are some shortcomings and difficulties, we advocate merging the two concentrated internships into one, and demand that the content of the internship be greatly simplified, and some people even propose to only try teaching but not practice class teacher work, what exactly is our direction? What conditions should the middle school teachers we want to train have? Only trying teaching but not practicing class teacher work is equivalent to saying that the new type of people's teachers we train are still people who only teach and do not care about educating people. Does this meet the requirements of New China? If a four-year normal university changes two twelve-week internships to one six-week internship, then should the two-year normal junior college still have internships? As for the reason for dividing it into two times, in addition to the different objects of internship (junior high school, senior high school), the different content, and the different methods, the previous requirement is to make a preliminary attempt with the joint help of teachers from the department and the middle school, and the latter focuses on the cultivation of independent work ability. Another more important significance is based on the principle of "practice, understanding, re-practice, re-understanding". After one internship, after a period of chewing, digestion, and even knowledge supplementation, the perceptual and rational understanding of the second internship has been improved, which is much more effective than doing it all in one go (even if it is a few weeks longer). Now the Soviet Union has extended the second internship to eight weeks. If we only seek convenience and effort, will the specifications of the new type of people's teachers we require also be discounted? A leader of the department's internship said it well: "On the surface, it is a question of one or two internships, but in the final analysis, it is a question of the direction and essence of normal universities."

    It seems that it is not enough to only take educational practice as an example. Some people advocate merging "pedagogy" and "specialized teaching methods" into one course, some suggest simply changing "pedagogy" and "psychology" to elective courses, and others insist on canceling "history of education"... Are these arguments actually crushing the other three components of the teaching plan to strengthen so-called professional education? If these are really implemented one by one, will the normal university be castrated?

    The proportion of professional subjects in each department should account for, of course, is a question worth studying. If there are unsuitable places in the public compulsory courses, necessary adjustments can also be made. However, the four components of the teaching plan are neither allowed to be crushed, nor allowed to reduce or simplify any component other than the major to the point where it cannot play its due role in cultivating new types of people's teachers.

    In the past few years, New China has been universally demanding that every middle school or elementary school teacher study pedagogy, psychology, teaching methods, etc., but normal universities themselves have not made this requirement. Times have changed, is it okay for every teacher in a normal university, no matter what you teach, not to study these subjects? Some people do not understand and do not study these subjects, and easily advocate merging or canceling these subjects. Isn't it too subjective? A teacher once said after guiding an internship: "It turns out there is so much knowledge in pedagogy!" Can't this example be regarded as a lesson?

    We can also take "history of education" as an example. Today, we only teach the history of Western education, and what we teach and learn may have some shortcomings. But what is the basis for saying that the history of education is useless for departments other than the education department? A middle school teacher, no matter what subject he teaches, if he has no knowledge of "history of education", how will he look at the teaching plan, teaching syllabus, teaching materials, methods, etc. related to him from a developmental perspective? Some people say that knowledge of "history of education" can be taught in "world history" and "Chinese history", then doesn't this form that any history can be placed in "Chinese history" and "world history"? For example, how much weight does the theory and achievements of the great educator Comenius of Czechoslovakia occupy in "world history"? If it is said that it is absolutely necessary to improve the teaching of "history of education" to be more concise and to the point. Why must we squeeze out educational subjects when we talk about strengthening professional subjects? What is the meaning of "use"?

    Some people say that the current main task of normal universities is to train senior teachers rather than junior teachers, and fewer and fewer graduates are assigned to middle schools. Why do we still pay so much attention to middle schools? The answer to this question is also very simple: The senior teachers we train, as long as they teach in normal colleges and schools, their task is still to train middle school teachers. If they lack understanding of middle school education, they will inevitably feel difficult. Look, the more than a dozen Soviet experts who have come to Beijing Normal University in recent years are mostly teachers or administrative leaders of Soviet normal colleges. Each of them is very familiar with the teaching syllabus of related majors in middle schools, and they are very interested in going to our middle schools for counseling or research. And from their analysis of the lessons taught by middle school teachers or intern students, it can be seen that they are proficient in middle school teaching methods. In a word, the work of these experts truly embodies the true colors of "teachers of normal colleges".

    It can also be mentioned that, because we are somewhat ambiguous about the direction of normal universities, even when our normal universities send teachers to study in the Soviet Union, there are different views on the question of "whether to enter a comprehensive university in the Soviet Union or a normal college in the Soviet Union".

    In summary, all the above-mentioned problems arise from whether normal universities and comprehensive universities should have differences. If we do not focus on the different tasks and different directions, then there will be errors in confusing the majors of the two types of universities simply because the names are the same, and even blindly comparing the level of academic level. Since what we are training are teachers, it is necessary to master more knowledge and skills in education, and it is even more necessary that their majors are fully combined with the educational subjects they study. The way to combine is to go through usual teaching (including content and methods) and educational practice. Even if they have learned less in certain things in their majors compared to students from comprehensive universities, and these things are useful for being a teacher, as long as they have the ability to work independently, they will make up for it in their work. Will they not continue to improve after becoming teachers?

    As mentioned earlier, a major problem that makes normal universities easily lose their direction is the question of how to interpret the "science" of "marching towards science" for normal universities. Of course, if someone is willing to study a certain problem in his major, no one has the right to object. If it is taken as the guiding principle of normal universities, is it necessary to unify the so-called major with the educational subject? This makes it possible to place the focus of scientific research in normal universities on education. That is to say, a doctoral or associate doctoral dissertation, although it is of a certain major, should be combined with education as much as possible because he is a doctoral or associate doctoral in normal education. Without this, normal universities and comprehensive universities will have no difference or very little difference. Does this problem have to be solved only after our "Academy of Educational Sciences" is established?

    Finally, I want to say that normal university is an "education university" whose task is to train teachers. No matter whether the teachers she trains are intermediate or senior, she directly or indirectly serves ordinary education; if she is divorced from ordinary education, normal university has no need to exist. So comparing us with comprehensive universities is unfounded.

    Anti-dogmatism is absolutely necessary. But the more thoroughly we oppose dogmatism, the more we must grasp the direction of our normal universities. The direction problem is not only related to the training of thousands of "engineers of the human soul" in the future, but also determines the role of the "workhorse of education" in New China. Therefore, for this major issue, I am willing to use my humble opinion to "contend" for a while, and at the same time I am looking forward to the criticism and guidance of different opinions.

    师范大学往那里去
    董渭川
    “教师是人类灵魂的工程师”。
    “师范教育是教育的工作母机”。
    这是解放以来常常听到的话。这类话充分表现了党和人民政府对教育事业的重视，也反映着到了人民的时代，教师这一职业的地位获得了空前的提高。
    不仅在语言上，同时在行动上有计划地大量设立高级和中级的师范学校，这就为新中国教育的普及和提高，在人力和其他方面逐步地准备条件。
    要了解新中国师范教育的发展，单从表面上看是不够的，还必须就这几年来我们的师范教育在本质方面的改变，来看它是怎样逐步地成为真正的师范教育的。为什么说是“真正的”呢？这因为在旧中国，师范教育虽然有了半个世纪的历史，而它一直交着厄运，甚至被某些学阀视为眼中钉，不光高等师范学校曾经变为普通大学，连中等师范学校也曾经并为普通中学的师范科，其目的在于消灭师范教育，所持的理论是“只要有学问，就能当好教师”，所以用不着单独举办师范教育，更不需要研究师范教育的特色。在那种环境和思想的支配之下，不光许多青年不愿意学师范，连办高级师范教育的人，为了“力争上游”，不惜改变自己的一切来向综合大学看齐，看齐的办法是尽量使自己设立的院、系以至各种学科同综合大学没有多大差别，所差的只是多了几个教育科目。这样，师范生的专业思想难以树立，固不用说；在师范学校中当教师的也有“屈就”的感觉，这些事实都证明旧中国师范教育的“师范”性质是很薄弱的。
    解放以后，全国旧有的和陆续新设的师范院、校，在“培养德才兼备、体魄健全的人民教师”这一方针之下，首先是所设系、科的教学计划的内容上体现了师范教育的特色，具体说，任何系、科的教学计划都是由四个部分组成的：第一是政治学科；第二是教育学科；第三是专业学科；第四是教育实习。我们从这里可以看出：教育学科和教育实习作为两个组成部分同专业学科并列，既不是点缀，也不是附庸，这就首先明确了什么是师范教育；不仅这样，政治学科和专业学科必须是和其他两个组成部分（教育学科和教育实习）密切联系着的，而不是彼此孤立的；具体说，虽然在师范院、校中也有历史、地理、物理、化学之类在名称上和综合大学相同的系、科，但是首先在任务上和综合大学是不同的，因而这些系、科中开设的科目以及每一科目的教学大纲和教学方法都必须是同综合大学有某些显著区别的。这因为我们的目的是为了培养教师，而不是培养作家、画家或者其他研究人材；虽然事实上一个教师也可以同时是作家、画家或者某方面的研究人材，两者不一定矛盾，但是师范教育的任务就在于培养教师，而不是别的。如果师范学校的毕业生不乐于当教师或者不善于当教师，这就是师范教育的失败。同样，如果医学院、校的毕业生对医药无兴趣或者不谙医药之道，能获得社会的原谅吗？
    但是问题并不这样简单。假如师范院、校中只有一个教育系，它的学生将来出去都任教教育学科，就没有什么矛盾。而师范院、校是给中学和师范学校供给各种学科的教师的，因而所设的系、科在十个以上，这就产生了种种的矛盾问题：首先是，专业知识如果学不好，怎样当教师呢？跟着就是，专业学科和教育学科的比重应当怎样规定呢？既然综合大学的毕业生也可以当中学教师，由于他们学的教育学科少或者根本不学，其专业水平可能比师范毕业生高，而师范生仅只多掌握了一些教育知识和技能，两者在实践中比较，师范生会不会“相形见绌”呢？再就是，师范院、校是为中学培养教师的，为了切合中学的实际，就需要在日常工作中“面向中学”，这不妨碍对专业的研讨吗？
    尤其是在“向科学进军”的号召提出以后，无形中更加重了师范教育的矛盾，不论数学系也好，历史系也好，向科学进军的“科学”是指的他们的本专业呢？还是也包括着教育学科呢？对师范院、校的“副博士”和“博士”的要求，和综合大学的有没有区别呢？对于前一问题，固然可以很轻易地回答：“本专业和教育科学两者兼容并包，只要能有所成就，什么都好。”但是实际上，这样的兼容并包，等于使师范院、校向综合大学的道路上发展，原因是各系、科的教师和学生都会很自然地向他们的本专业用力，并且很自然地造成在师范学校里鄙薄和排斥教育学科的不幸。
    不相信吗？可以拿我所在的北京师范大学作证。为说明问题，这里不妨作一简单的历史叙述：当1952年春天，我们在苏联专家的帮助下制订各系教学计划的时候，为了取消某些为培养中学教师所不需要的学科而形成严重的思想斗争；主张保留的人认为，取消了这些学科，我们的学术水平就降低了，再不能同综合大学比拟了。跟着在制订某些学科的教学大纲时，也有过类似的争执。虽然勉强把教学计划和教学大纲订下来了，而一直有专业学科在四个组成部分所占比重太低的埋怨。几年以来，某些学科教学脱离中学实际的情况，每到学生们去中学里作教育实习，就反映得很尖锐。虽然有很多人对于到中学里指导学生实习用了很大的力，而另有一部分人则视为苦事，甚至连某些青年教师也感到指导实习妨碍他们的科学研究。至于科学研究，两年以来，以教育学科为题的所占百分比很低；假如把教育系除外，就更低。有些在师范大学应当首先研究的问题，例如什么是全面发展的教育，在两年前的报章杂志中已经有了争执，这问题不应当是师范大学的各系（而不仅教育系）共同研究的吗？又如“面向中学”是师范大学的方针之一，可是大家对于什么是“面向中学”，也各有理解，这不也是应当系统研究的吗？但是这类的问题并没有引起大家的注意。至于“面向中学”的具体工作，有些系陆续作了不少，但多半是被动的、无计划的（例如被中学邀请作报告之类），很少是有目的、有系统的；并且有的系没做什么，有些教师更同这项工作没有关系。这一切不都在证明着师范大学这部车子往什么方向开，还存在着一些问题吗？这些不都是属于思想认识的问题吗？
    思想认识的问题当然是要长期解决的，但是通过最近的反教条主义，上述的矛盾更表面化了，因而师范大学向何处去这一方向性的问题也就更使人有些迷惑了。有些人根据“专业学科的比重太轻”和“学生的负担太重”两大理由而主张缩减教学计划的其他三个组成部分，就是归并政治学科、减少教育学科和简化教育实习。别的不谈，专就教育实习说，教学计划中规定，第六、第七两个学期各有六周的集中实习，从时数上看，共为十二周，仅占学生们在校八个学期（每学期以二十周计）一百六十周的十三分之一弱（约合7.5％），这能算“多”吗？不把教育实习并入教育学科，而单独列为一个组成部分，这不仅表明在师范学校里理论结合实践的重要，并且体现了它和那三个组成部分的互相制约。理论结合实践的必要是任何人都承认的，但是实际上师范生到中学里前后两次实习（一在初中，一在高中），听中学领导人和教师作几项报告、试教约八节课、作几项班主任工作，再就是写实习日记、作实习总结等，这能算“多”吗？只因为旧时代师范学校的实习是到毕业前当例行公事办的，不像今天这样认真，并且旧日的实习只限于教几节课，而现在课后要开评议会，还要当班主任，增添了不少麻烦，尤其是过去只由教学法教师负责，现在因为实习学生多，要动员很多教师参加，新的实习和旧的实习两相对照，这就显得处处是矛盾了。
    为什么由反教条主义而牵涉到这许多问题？因为教学计划是以苏联师范学院的教学计划作蓝本的，教育实习更是向苏联学习来的，这中间既然有了一些问题，道理就归落到教条主义地学习苏联而没能适当地结合中国的实际了。但是事实上究竟怎样呢？仍以教育实习为例说，我们已经进行了九届实习，每届完了，实习学生都感到有很大的收获，不仅通过实践培养了教学和教育的技能，并且验证了和深化了所掌握的理论知识（包括本专业的和教育学科的），更重要的是巩固了充当人民教师的思想情感。从另一面看，几年以来接受过实习任务的五十来所学校，绝大多数都承认实习对于他们自身业务的提高是有帮助的；如果只是负担而没有好处，他们就不会主动地和我们订立长期互助的合同了。我们各系的教师，经过指导实习，和中学有了接触，很多人承认对于自己教学的改进也有益处。当然缺点也是有的，实习的规模愈来愈大，在组织安排上和要求上都有不够妥善的地方；并且困难也是有的，如教学计划和实习的不适应（特别表现在生物系），一次实习要动员很多人力，影响到平时的教学等。但是，在研究这类问题的时候，应当从目的和效果出发呢，还是从缺点和困难出发？如果因为有某些缺点和困难，就主张把两次集中实习并为一次，就要求把实习的内容大大简化，甚至有人提议光试教而不实习班主任工作，究竟我们的方向是什么？我们要培养的中学教师应当具备一些什么条件？光试教而不实习班主任，就等于说我们培养的新型人民教师，仍旧是只管教书不管教人的人，这合乎新中国的要求吗？如果四年制的师范大学把两次十二周的实习改为一次六周，那末，二年制的师范专科学校还要不要实习呢？至于分为两次的道理，除掉实习的对象不同（初中、高中）、内容不同、方法不同以外，在要求上前一次是在系的和中学的教师共同帮助下作初步尝试，而后一次就着重在独立工作能力的培养了。还有一个更重要的意义是本着“实践，认识，再实践，再认识”的道理，在一次实习以后，经过一个时期的咀嚼、消化以至于知识的补充，再次实习的感性认识和理性认识就都提高了，这比一气呵成（即令多几周）的效果大得多。现在苏联已经把第二次实习延长为八周了。假如我们只图简便省力，所要求的新型人民教师的规格是不是也跟着打折扣呢？有一位系的实习领导人说得好：“表面上是实习的一次两次问题，归根结底是师范大学的方向问题、本质问题。”
    光拿教育实习作例，似乎还不够。有人主张把“教育学”和“专科教学法”合并为一门课，有人建议干脆把“教育学”、“心理学”都改为选修，还有人坚持取消“教育史”，……这些论调是不是在实际上粉碎教学计划的其他三个组成部分，用来加强所谓专业教育呢？如果真把这些一一实现，是不是把师范大学阉割了呢？
    各系专业学科的比重应当占多少，当然是一个值得研究的问题。公共必修科如果有不适宜处，也可以作必要的调整。但是教学计划的四个组成部分既不许可粉碎，也不许可把专业以外的其他任何一个组成部分缩小或者简化到不能对于培养新型人民教师起它所应该起的作用。
    新中国这几年来在普遍地要求着每一位中学或小学教师研究教育学、心理学、教学法等，而师范大学自身却并没提出这种要求。时代变了，师范大学的每一位教师，不管你是教什么的，不研究这些学科成吗？有的人既不了解而又不研究这些学科，就轻易主张合并或者取消这些学科，未免太主观了吧？曾经有一位教师在指导了一次实习以后说：“原来教育学中有这么多的学问！”这个例子不正可当作经验教训看待吗？
    我们还可以拿“教育史”作例，今天教的还只是西洋教育史，而且所教所学可能有某些缺点。但是硬说教育系以外的各系学了“教育史”无用，是什么根据呢？一个中学教师，不管他教的是什么学科，如果他毫无“教育史”的知识，对于和他有关的教学计划、教学大纲、教材、方法等，他将怎样从发展上看问题呢？有人说，可以把“教育史”的知识放在“世界史”和“中国史”里教，那末，这不形成什么史都可以放在“中国史”和“世界史”里？例如捷克斯洛伐克夸美纽斯这位大教育家的学说和成就在“世界史”里能占多少分量？如果说把“教育史”的教学改进得更简明扼要，是完全必要的。为什么一说到加强专业学科，就必须挤掉教育学科呢？“用”的含义是什么？
    有人说，师范大学现时的主要任务是培养高级师资而不是中级师资了，并且毕业学生分配到中学去的越来越少了，何必还那么注意中学呢？对于这个问题的答复也很简单：我们培养的高级师资，只要是在师范院、校任教，他们还是以培养中学师资为任务，如果他们对于中学教育缺乏了解，他们就必然会感到困难。试看，几年来到北京师范大学来的十几位苏联专家，绝大多数是苏联师范学院的教师或者行政领导人。他们每个人对于中学的有关专业的教学大纲都是很熟悉的，对于到我们的中学去作辅导或者作研究都是有很大兴趣的，并且从他们分析中学教师或者实习学生教的课中，可以看出他们对于中学教学法的娴熟。一句话，从这些专家们的工作中真正体现了“师范学院的教师”的本色。
    还可以联带说到，由于我们对师范大学的方向性有些模糊，就连我们的师范大学派教师去苏联学习，也在“究竟入苏联的综合大学呢，入苏联的师范学院呢”这样的问题上存在着不同看法。
    总起来说，上述的一切问题，都产生于师范大学和综合大学应不应该有区别上。如果不从任务不同、方向不同着眼，那就会产生把两种大学的专业只因为名称相同而混为一谈的错误，甚至盲目地比较起学术水平的高低来。我们培养的既然是教师，就有必要多掌握一些教育方面的知识技能，而且他们所学的专业更完全有必要和所学的教育学科结合起来。结合的办法是，既要通过平时的教学（包括内容和方法），又要通过教育实习。即令他们在本专业方面比较综合大学的学生少学了某些东西，而这些东西又对当教师有用的话，只要他们具有了独立工作的能力，他们会在工作岗位上补起来的。难道他们当了教师就不再进修吗？
    前文已经说到，当前一个使师范大学容易迷失方向的重大问题，是“向科学进军”的“科学”对于师范大学作何解释的问题。当然，如果有人愿意研究他的本专业的某一问题，谁也没有权利反对。如果作为师范大学方针来说，是不是有必要把所谓本专业和教育学科统一起来？这样就有可能把师范大学的科学研究的重点安放在教育上。就是说，一个博士或副博士的论文，尽管是某种专业的，却因为他这个博士或副博士是属于师范教育方面的，他所研究的东西就应该尽可能和教育相结合。不这样，就会使师范大学和综合大学无区别或者很少区别。难道这问题一定要到我们的“教育科学院”产生以后才能解决吗？
    最后我要说，师范大学是以培养师资为任务的“教育大学”，不论她所培养的师资是中级的、高级的，反正她都直接间接为普通教育服务；假如脱离了普通教育，师范大学就没有存在的必要。所以拿我们和综合大学来比，是无根据的。
    反教条主义是完全必要的。但是教条主义反得愈彻底，就愈要掌握住我们师范大学的方向。方向问题既关系着今后成千上万的“人类灵魂的工程师”的培养，又决定着新中国“教育工作母机”的作用的发挥。因此，为了这一重大问题，愿意用我的一管之见“争鸣”一番，同时我在期待着不同意见的批评和指教。
