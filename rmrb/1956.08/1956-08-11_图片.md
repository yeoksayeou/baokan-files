    To meet the needs of workers' lives, the state-owned commercial departments in Xi'an actively expand the supply of living materials to factories and construction sites. The Xi'an suburban factory and construction site supply company has several large trucks delivering living materials to suburban factories and construction sites every day. Now, this company has set up a variety of supply services such as vegetables, canteens, clothing, and general merchandise, with a total of 10,000 kinds of goods. Currently, in the hot summer, workers on construction sites more than 20 miles away from the city can buy popsicles, soda, and other cold foods in nearby stores.
    This is a business room of the first sales department of the Dongjiao store of the Xi'an suburban factory and construction site supply company. It receives 10,000 to 20,000 customers every day. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sheng Jirun photographed.

    为满足职工们的生活需要，西安市国营商业部门积极扩展工厂工地生活资料的供应业务。西安市郊区工厂工地供应公司每天都有好几辆大卡车向郊区工厂和工地输送生活资料。现在这个公司已设置有蔬菜、食堂、服装、日用杂货等多种供应业务，经营的商品品种共达一万种。目前正当炎夏的时候，离城二十多里的工地的工人们，在附近的商店里就可以买到冰棒，汽水等冷食。
