	Seize the Opportunity, Rush to Harvest and Plant
	The drought situation in Jiangxi Province has not been completely alleviated. Due to the drought resistance efforts, the progress of summer harvesting and planting in various regions has been very slow. Currently, the area of early rice harvested in the province only accounts for 54% of the area that should be harvested, and the area planted with late rice only accounts for half of the original planting plan. Judging from the current situation, the yield per unit area of early rice can generally increase by 8% to 10%, but the six million mu of middle rice affected by the drought is likely to have reduced production. If the planned planting of late rice and autumn crops is not completed, this year's agricultural production increase plan for Jiangxi Province is in danger of failing.
	The Jiangxi Daily of August 3rd published an editorial entitled "Mobilize All Forces to Launch a Rush to Harvest and Plant Movement," pointing out this danger and calling on the entire province to seize the opportunity before and after the Beginning of Autumn, vigorously rush to harvest early rice, rush to plant late rice, and quickly set off a upsurge in expanding the area of autumn planting.
	The Jiangxi Daily editorial said: Rushing to plant late rice and expanding the area of autumn planting are the keys to determining whether late autumn crops can increase production. At present, less than four million mu of late rice have been planted in the province, and there are only a few days left before the "Beginning of Autumn" season. Therefore, wherever there is a water source, all late rice seedlings must be planted according to the original plan within the next ten days. Where there is a temporary lack of water sources, vigorously promote and popularize the method of transplanting seedlings. Where there is a real lack of water sources and seedlings cannot be transplanted, consider changing to planting other crops as soon as possible. Areas where it is indeed difficult to plant late rice should realistically help farmers solve their difficulties, or change to planting other crops. Expanding the area of autumn planting is an effective way to make up for losses caused by drought. In formulating autumn planting plans, various regions can appropriately consider making up for the part of the autumn planting area that was squeezed out due to expanding late rice planting by vigorously expanding the planting of high-yield crops and miscellaneous grain crops such as soybeans, sweet potatoes, corn, and millet, and strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.

### 抓紧时机  抢收抢种

    抓紧时机　抢收抢种
    江西省的旱象仍未完全解除。由于抗旱，各地夏收夏种的进度非常迟缓。目前全省早稻已经收割了的面积只占应收面积的54％，晚稻的插秧面积只占原订种植计划的一半。根据目前情况判断，早稻单位面积产量一般可以增产8％到10％，但六百万亩受旱的中稻很可能减产。如果晚稻与秋种作物完不成预订的播种计划，今年江西省的农业增产计划就有落空的危险。
    八月三日的江西日报，以“调动一切力量开展抢收抢种运动”为题发表社论，指出了这个危险，号召全省抓紧立秋前后的时机，大力抢收早稻，抢种晚稻，迅速掀起扩大秋种面积的热潮。
    江西日报社论说：赶插晚稻和扩大秋种面积，是决定晚秋作物能否增产的关键。目前全省种下去的晚稻还不到四百万亩，现在离“立秋”季节只有几天时间了。因此凡有水源的地方必须在最近十天内，按原计划把晚稻秧全部插下去，暂时缺乏水源的地方，可以大力提倡和推广掇秧办法。确实缺乏水源无法插秧的，要及早考虑改种其他作物。插晚稻确有困难的地区，就应当实事求是的帮助农民解决困难，或者改种其他作物。扩大秋种面积是弥补受旱损失的有效方法。各地在制定秋种计划中，可以适当考虑把因扩种晚稻而挤掉的一部分秋种作物面积弥补上去，大力扩种大豆、蕃薯、玉米、小粟等高产作物和杂粮作物，并争取晚秋作物的丰收。（新华社）
