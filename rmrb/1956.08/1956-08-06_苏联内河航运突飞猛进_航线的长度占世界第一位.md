    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, August 5th. Mr. Shashkov, Minister of the Maritime Transport Department of the Russian Federal Republic of the Soviet Union, introduced the situation of Soviet inland waterway transportation and its development in the Sixth Five-Year Plan at a press conference yesterday. He announced that the length of Soviet inland waterways ranks first in the world. The press conference was held on the "Gorky" ship.
    Shashkov said: Water conservancy construction has played a significant role in the development of inland waterway transportation. For example, the Volga-Don Canal connects the European part of the Soviet Union into a unified river transport system. At present, the Soviet Union's inland waterway routes are 132,000 kilometers long, double that of Russia before the revolution. Hydroelectric power stations have been built on many large rivers, improving navigation conditions. Now the volume of transportation is three times higher than in 1913, and passenger transport has increased six times. From 1950 to 1955, river transport volume increased from 85.5 million tons to 129.3 million tons. By the completion of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the volume of inland waterway transportation will increase greatly; in particular, the transportation volume of the Moscow Canal and the White Sea-Baltic Canal will increase by half, and the Volga-Don Canal will increase by two times.
    When talking about the increase in ships in the post-war era, Shashkov said: At present, the number of transport ships has almost doubled. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, faster ships will be further increased. Cargo ships and passenger ships with a total carrying capacity of 3.1 million horsepower will be manufactured.

    苏联内河航运突飞猛进
    航线的长度占世界第一位
    本报莫斯科5日电　苏联俄罗斯联邦共和国海运部部长夏什科夫昨天在记者招待会上介绍了苏联内河航运及其在第六个五年计划中发展的情况。他宣布说，苏联内河航线的长度占世界第一位。招待会是在“高尔基”号轮船上举行的。
    夏什科夫说：水利方面的建设对于内河航运的发展起了很大作用，如伏尔加—顿运河使苏联欧洲部分连成了一个统一的河上运输系统。目前苏联内河航线长达十三万二千公里，比革命前的俄罗斯航线增加了一倍。在许多大河上建筑了水利发电站，改善了通航条件。现在运输量比1913年增加了三倍，客运增加了六倍。从1950—1955年，河上运输量由八千五百五十万吨增加到一万二千九百三十万吨。到第六个五年计划完成时，内河运输量更将大大增加；其中特别是莫斯科运河，白海到波罗的海的运河运输量将增加半倍，伏尔加—顿运河增加两倍。
    夏什科夫在说到船只在战后年代增加的情况时说：目前运输船只已增加了将近一倍。在第六个五年计划中还要进一步增加快速度的船只。将要制造货船和客船总载重量是三百一十万马力。
