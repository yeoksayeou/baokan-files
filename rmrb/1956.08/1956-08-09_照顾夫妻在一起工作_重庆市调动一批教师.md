Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th: This summer, after conducting a comprehensive survey of teachers whose spouses work in different locations, the Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau contacted relevant authorities in various regions and has transferred more than 130 primary and secondary school teachers who were not working near their spouses to work in the same or neighboring areas. Some involved transferring one spouse from another province to Chongqing, while others involved transferring a spouse from Chongqing to another province. Zhao Suqin, a teacher at Chongqing No. 9 Middle School, had difficulties transferring her husband, who worked at the Huaihe River Navigation Administration in Bengbu, Anhui. The Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau found a way to transfer Zhao Suqin to Anhui.

In the past, Chongqing Municipality had relatively few teachers of physics, chemistry, and biology. Now that some are being transferred out, the shortage is even more pronounced. To prepare for the teacher transfers, the Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau organized a group of former junior middle school physics, chemistry, and biology teachers for advanced studies to supplement the ranks of senior middle school physics, chemistry, and biology teachers. Furthermore, a group of primary school teachers and unemployed intellectuals will be cultivated and trained to become junior middle school physics, chemistry, and biology teachers.

    照顾夫妻在一起工作  重庆市调动一批教师
    据新华社重庆7日电　今年暑期，重庆市教育局对于夫妇不在一起工作的教师普遍进行了调查以后，和各地的有关机关联系，已经将夫妇不在一起工作的中小学教师一百三十多人，调在一起或邻近地方工作。有些是将夫妇一方从外地调到重庆的，有的是从重庆调到外地工作的。重庆第九中学教师赵素琴，爱人在安徽蚌埠淮河航运管理局工作，调动有困难，重庆市教育局就设法把赵素琴调到安徽去。
    过去，重庆市的理化、生物教师比较少，现在有些要调出去，就更感到缺乏。为了准备调动教师，重庆市教育局组织一批原来的初中理化和生物教师进修，补充高中理化、生物教师。再从小学教师和失业知识分子中培养、训练一批初中的理化、生物教师。
