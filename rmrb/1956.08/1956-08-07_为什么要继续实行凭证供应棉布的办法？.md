    Why Continue the Method of Rationing Cotton Cloth?
    Recently, many readers have written suggesting that the method of rationing cotton cloth be abolished. They believe that free purchase is more convenient, and the state can also save on the paper and printing costs of cloth coupons. Moreover, many people simply cannot use up their cloth coupons, so the state can abolish the cloth coupon system. Although these comrades have good intentions, why does the state not abolish cloth coupons today and continue to implement the system of purchasing cloth with coupons? We know that purchasing cotton cloth with coupons is a necessary measure for the planned supply of goods. For the past two years, the state has implemented this method, which has limited consumption but has basically met the needs of the people and maintained the stability of cotton cloth prices. If this method is not implemented, that is, if the needs of consumers are met without limitation, is it possible? From the current situation of cotton cloth production, the conditions are not yet ripe. In 1955, due to insufficient raw material supply, cotton cloth production decreased by 16% compared to 1954, while sales increased by 8.4% compared to 1954. It is very obvious that if cotton cloth were not subject to planned supply, the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand would be more serious. This year, it is estimated that cotton cloth production will increase by about 28% compared to last year, but in the first half of this year, the quantity of cotton cloth sold by the China Textile Company system increased by 41% compared to the same period last year. This shows that the speed of consumption growth is still faster than the speed of production growth. Under these circumstances, abolishing the planned supply method is not feasible.
    Some people also ask: Since cotton cloth must be purchased with cloth coupons, why do some areas not collect cloth coupons for purchasing certain cotton cloth within a certain period of time? This is a temporary regulation made by the state based on the source of certain cotton cloth varieties to take care of some consumers who do not have enough cloth coupons, but this does not mean that the planned supply has been abolished. Some time ago, some retail units in individual areas had the practice of not collecting cloth coupons casually. This practice violated the planned supply policy and has now been corrected.
    As for what to do with the cloth coupons that some people cannot use up? The government's quota for consumers is determined according to different regions and different economic conditions, but it is difficult to fully suit the specific purchasing power of everyone. Therefore, there will inevitably be a phenomenon where some people do not have enough cloth coupons and some people have a surplus of cloth coupons. Those with a surplus can automatically adjust the unused cloth coupons to those who do not have enough, which is beneficial to the country and to consumers.

### 为什么要继续实行凭证供应棉布的办法？

    为什么要继续实行凭证供应棉布的办法？
    最近不少读者来信，建议取消棉布凭票供应的办法。他们认为：自由购买比较方便，国家也可以节省印刷布票的纸张和印刷费，何况许多人的布票根本用不完，因此国家可以取消布票制度了。这些同志的用意虽然好，但是今天国家为什么不废除布票而仍继续实行凭票购布的办法呢？我们知道棉布凭证购买，是计划供应商品的一种必要办法。两年来，国家实行了这种办法，虽然限制了消费，但是基本上满足了人民的需要，保持了棉布价格的稳定。如果不实行这个办法，就是说无限制地满足消费者的需要，是不是可能呢？从当前棉布生产的情况来说，条件还是不成熟的。1955年由于原料供应不足，棉布产量反较1954年减少16％，销售量却比1954年增长8.4％，十分明显，如果不是由于棉布实行计划供应，供不应求的现象就会比较严重。今年预计棉布产量将比去年增长28％左右，但今年上半年中国纺织品公司系统销售棉布的数量却比去年同期上升41％。这说明消费增长的速度仍快于生产增长的速度。在这种情况下，取消计划供应的办法是行不通的。
    也有人问：既然棉布要凭布票购买，为什么有些地区在一定的时间内购买某些棉布又不收布票呢？这是国家根据某些棉布品种的货源情况，照顾一些布票不足的消费者的一种临时规定，但这并不是取消了计划供应。前些时候，个别地区有些零售单位曾经有过随便不收布票的做法。这种做法是违反计划供应政策的，现在已经纠正。
    至于有些人布票用不完如何办？政府规定消费者的定量，是根据不同地区，不同经济条件确定的，但也很难完全适合每一个人的具体购买力，因此，一定会出现有些人布票不足，有些人布票有余的现象。有余的人可以把用不完的布票自动调剂给不足的人，这样对国家对消费者都有好处。
