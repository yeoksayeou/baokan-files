    "Legal" but Unreasonable
    Not long ago, the First Engineering Section of the Northeast Third Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering made a regulation: Monday to Friday evenings are "legally mandated" social activity time. These five evenings, in addition to one evening of cultural classes and one evening of Party and League activities, are also filled with union group meetings, employee meetings, work experience exchange meetings, and other activities. Although there is no fixed schedule for Saturday evenings, they are often used to solve so-called "problems that have not been solved during the week."
    After the implementation of this regulation, some leaders said with satisfaction: "There is so much work, it is really necessary to do this!" However, the employees are finding it difficult to cope. Some employees, in order to advance in science and culture, do not go to bed until midnight and get up at four or five in the morning. The studies and physical health of many employees have been negatively affected.
    This phenomenon of encroaching on employees' spare time is quite common. The characteristic of this engineering section is that it wants to legalize the unreasonable practice of encroaching on employees' spare time with a written regulation. However, regardless of whether such a regulation is made, this practice can never be "legalized." Because employees have the right to demand to dispose of their own spare time. So, what about "so much work"? Then there is only one way – use your brains and come up with ideas to improve work methods and increase work efficiency.

    “合法”而不合理
    建筑工程部东北第三工程公司第一工程处不久以前作了一项规定：星期一到星期五的五天晚上，是“法定”的社会活动时间。这五天晚上，除了一天文化课，一天党团活动，还排满了工会小组会、职工大会、工作经验交流会等活动日程。星期六晚上虽然没有固定的日程，但是也常被利用来解决所谓“一周内没有解决的问题”。
    实行这项规定以后，有些领导人满意地说：“工作这么多，真需要这样做呵！”但是职工们却有些吃不消。有些职工为了向科学、文化进军，半夜才睡觉，早上四、五点钟就起床。不少职工的学习和身体健康已经受到不好的影响。
    这种侵占职工业余时间的现象是相当普遍的。这个工程处的特点是，想用一纸规定，把侵占职工业余时间的不合理的作法合法化。但是，不管是否作这样的规定，这种作法总是“合法”不了的。因为职工们有权利要求自行支配业余时间。那末，“工作多”又怎么办呢？那只有一条路——开动脑筋，在改进工作方法、提高工作效率方面打主意。
