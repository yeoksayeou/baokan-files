    China's Oldest Library
    Zixia Tianzhang
    Shining on the shores of the East China Sea, nestled in the beautiful Siming Mountains, lies a magnificent pearl of China's national cultural heritage—the Tianyi Pavilion Library in Ningbo, China's oldest library.

    This spacious pavilion still maintains the architectural style of four hundred years ago. The six rooms on the upper floor are combined into one, separated by bookcases, while the lower floor is divided into six rooms. Beneath the pavilion panels are brightly colored caisson patterns. To the south of the pavilion is a pool of water, clear and reflective. To the south of the pool and the north of the pavilion are exquisitely designed rockeries, pavilions, and other garden scenes. The pavilion is surrounded by ancient trees reaching for the sky, creating a very peaceful environment.

    Tianyi Pavilion was built between 1561 and 1566, during the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing era, and has a long history of nearly four hundred years. It was founded by Fan Qin, who served as Vice Minister of the Ministry of War in the Ming Dynasty. Fan Qin loved books, and in his later years, after retiring from officialdom and returning to his hometown of Ningbo, he collected and reprinted many valuable books and built this library.

    In 1773, during the reign of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong Emperor, in order to compile the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature), he ordered book collectors across the country to donate books. At that time, Tianyi Pavilion contributed 638 types of books, most of which were selected for inclusion in the Siku Quanshu, and were considered the most valuable of the books donated by collectors nationwide. In addition to awarding Tianyi Pavilion a copy of the "Gujin Tushu Jicheng" (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), the Qianlong Emperor also sent people to Ningbo to investigate the architectural structure of Tianyi Pavilion. Later, the Wen Yuan, Wen Yuan, and other seven pavilions that housed the Siku Quanshu in Beijing were built in imitation of the Tianyi Pavilion style.

    Over the past four hundred years, many precious books in Tianyi Pavilion's rich collection have been lost. During the Opium War in 1840, when British imperialist invaders occupied Ningbo, the Tianyi Pavilion's collection suffered its first plunder. In 1861, when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's rebel army entered Ningbo, bad elements took advantage of the chaos to steal many books, many of which were bought at high prices by French "missionaries." In 1914, American imperialists colluded with Shanghai's old book merchants, hiring the thief Xue Jiwei to dig through the Tianyi Pavilion floorboards and steal books step by step according to a list specified by the imperialists. This time, over a thousand valuable books were stolen. Over the years, patriotic people in Ningbo and descendants of Fan Qin have made great efforts to preserve this cultural heritage of the motherland. For example, before the fall of Ningbo in 1939, they moved the Tianyi Pavilion collection to the mountains of Longquan County, saving it from the ravages of that war. However, after several calamities, by the eve of liberation, the collection had dwindled from its original 70,000 volumes to only 14,000 to 15,000 volumes.

    In recent years, with the assistance of the government, Tianyi Pavilion has successively purchased some of its books, which had been lost among the people for decades or even more than a century, through the relationships of old book dealers and book collectors. It has also taken over a large number of precious cultural relics, such as famous books, paintings, rubbings, and antiques, donated and collected from book collectors in various places, greatly enriching and supplementing the original cultural relics of Tianyi Pavilion. In 1953, the government allocated funds to repair Tianyi Pavilion and purchased a nearby residential building, expanding the scope of Tianyi Pavilion and giving it a new look. Starting last year, the Ningbo Preservation Group of the Zhejiang Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee invited local calligraphers and painters to identify and sort the books taken over. Once the sorting is completed, the Tianyi Pavilion Library will open a reading room specifically for research purposes. (Attached picture)

    我国最古老的藏书楼
    子夏　天章
    在东海之滨、秀丽的四明山怀抱中，闪耀着我国民族文化遗产中的一颗瑰丽珍珠——我国最古老的藏书楼宁波天一阁。
    这幢宽敞的楼阁。至今还保持着四百年前的建筑样式。楼上六间合而为一，分间用书橱隔开，楼下分做六间。阁板下面是鲜艳的藻井图案。阁的南面有一口水池，池水清澈照人。池的南面和阁的北面，堆设着玲珑别致的假山亭榭等园景。阁的周围，古木参天，环境十分清静。
    天一阁修建于1561年至1566年明嘉靖年间，已有近四百年的悠久历史。创建人是当过明朝兵部侍郎的范钦。范钦爱书，他在晚年辞官回到故乡宁波后，收罗和翻印了许多有价值的书籍，并兴建了这所藏书楼。
    在公元1773年时，清乾隆皇帝为了修四库全书，命令全国藏书家献书。当时天一阁献书638种，其中大部分被选入四库全书，并被认为是全国藏书家所献的书籍中最有价值的。乾隆皇帝除了奖给天一阁一部“古今图书集成”外，还派人到宁波来考察天一阁的建筑构造，后来，在北京藏四库全书的文源、文渊等七个阁，就是仿天一阁的式样营造的。
    天一阁丰富的藏书，四百年来，已散失了很多珍贵的书籍。1840年鸦片战争英帝国主义侵略者占领宁波期间，天一阁的藏书受到了第一次掠夺。1861年太平天国起义军进入宁波时，坏分子又乘乱盗走了很多书籍，其中很多书为法国“传教士”高价收买了去。1914年美帝国主义竟勾结了上海的旧书奸商，雇用窃贼薛继谓挖开天一阁楼板，按照帝国主义者指定的书目，逐步窃取，这次被盗走的珍贵书籍约在一千部以上。历年来，宁波爱国人士和范钦后人虽为保存这一份祖国的文化遗产作了很大努力，如1939年宁波沦陷前夕，他们将天一阁藏书移藏在龙泉县山中，使在这次战争中得免于难，但经过了数次的浩劫，到解放前夕，终使藏书从原有的七万多卷减到仅存一万四、五千卷。
    这几年来，天一阁在政府协助下，通过旧书商人和藏书家的关系，陆续地把一部分数十年以至百余年前散失在民间的天一阁藏书收购回来；并且接管了一大批各地藏书家捐赠和征得的名书、名画、碑帖和古玩等珍贵文物，大大地丰富和充实了天一阁原有的文物。1953年，政府拨款修理了天一阁，并且征购了附近的一所民房，使天一阁的范围较前扩大，面貌焕然一新。从去年开始，浙江省文物管理委员会宁波保管小组邀请了当地的书家、画家对接管的图书进行鉴别和整理工作。整理就绪后，天一阁藏书楼将开辟一个阅览室，专供研究工作之用。（附图片）
