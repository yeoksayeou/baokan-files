Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 10th: TASS reports that the Soviet Foreign Ministry handed a note to the British Embassy in Moscow on August 9th, along with the Soviet government's statement on the Suez Canal issue, requesting that it be forwarded to the British government.

The Soviet government's note is a reply to the British government's note of August 3rd. In this note, the British government invited the Soviet government to participate in a conference to be held in London on August 16th to discuss the Suez Canal issue. The note also included the joint statement of the French, British, and American governments of August 2nd on the Suez Canal issue.

The Soviet government's reply pointed out that the Soviet government believes that the countries participating in the international conference discussing the Suez Canal issue should include, in addition to the twenty-four countries mentioned by the Western countries in the above-mentioned joint statement, twenty-one other countries related to the issue, such as Austria, the German Democratic Republic, Yugoslavia, Jordan, and Burma, as well as the People's Republic of China.

The reply also drew the British government's attention to the fact that, according to the 1888 Convention, the conference discussing issues related to the canal's navigation should be held in Cairo. The reply said that in order to better prepare, it would be best to hold the conference at the end of August.

Simultaneously with replying to the British government, the Soviet Foreign Ministry also sent similar notes, along with the "Soviet Government's Statement on the Suez Canal Issue," to the governments of all countries around the world.
