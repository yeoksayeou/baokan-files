Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: "Pravda" today published an editorial condemning the West German authorities' ban on the German Communist Party as a threat to the cause of peace and democracy.

The editorial said that the police attacks against the German Communist Party in West German cities these days cannot but remind people of all countries of the days when Hitler seized power, which is still fresh in their memory. How can the people of all countries, especially the German people, who paid a very heavy price for Hitler's adventure, forget all this when they see the current West German rulers taking the same path?

When talking about the attitude of the Social Democratic Party, "Pravda" wrote: The leaders of the Social Democratic Party pretend not to understand the full gravity of the established situation, and this position will only encourage the militarists to attack the living rights and interests of the working people. The Bonn ruling group's current arrest of communists and fighters for peace, as well as the movement against working-class organizations, is a blow to the entire working class, and an open attack on the basic rights of the German working people and the people's democratic freedoms. They are trying to silence the people, force them to be docile slaves, and cannon fodder for the new wars planned by German militarists.

"Pravda" said that the West German ruling group wants to ban the Communist Party because they are unwilling to restore German unity on the basis of peace and democracy. The Bonn authorities' actions show what methods they want to use to achieve national unification. This is a dangerous path of violence, terror, and war that breeds consequences that can lead to the country's death. Banning the German Communist Party can only mean one thing: someone in West Germany is paving the way for war. Neither the German people nor the people of other countries can tolerate this.

"Pravda" wrote that peace-loving people of all countries have always believed that the German working class can muster the strength to block the path of the reactionaries. The growing wave of popular protests against the new arbitrary actions of German militarism proves that the German people have begun to realize the full fatal significance of the actions taken by the Bonn government. The German people will certainly be able to achieve the goal of abolishing this arbitrary action and blocking the path of reactionaries, fascism, and war.

"Pravda" finally wrote that the German Communist Party has fought and will continue to fight for the great cause, for a new and bright future for the German nation. All progressive forces of mankind support and sympathize with the German Communist Party, and all peace-loving forces in all countries firmly oppose the arbitrary actions of West German militarism.

    “真理报”就德共事件发表社论
    谴责西德当局威胁和平和民主
    新华社莫斯科20日电　“真理报”今天发表社论，谴责西德当局禁止德国共产党是对和平和民主事业的威胁。
    社论说，这几天在西德城市中对德国共产党采取的警察袭击，不禁使人想起各国人民都还记忆犹新的希特勒夺取政权的日子。各国人民、首先是为希特勒的冒险付出了非常重大的代价的德国人民，看到目前的西德执政者走着同样的道路，怎样能够忘记这一切呢？
    在谈到社会民主党的态度的时候，“真理报”写道：社会民主党的领袖们装做似乎不了解既成的局势的一切严重性，这种立场只会鼓舞军国主义者向劳动人民的生活权利和利益进攻。波恩统治集团目前进行的对共产党员和争取和平的战士的逮捕以及反对工人阶级组织的运动，是对整个工人阶级的一个打击，是对德国劳动人民的基本权利和人民的民主自由的公开的进攻。他们企图封住人民的口，迫使人民做驯顺的奴隶，做德国军国主义者所策划的新战争的炮灰。
    “真理报”说，西德统治集团要禁止共产党，是因为他们不愿意在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一。波恩当局的行动表明，他们想用什么方法来达成国家的统一。这是一条危险的、孕育着能致国家死命的后果的暴力、恐怖和战争的道路。禁止德国共产党只能意味着一点：西德有人在为战争铺平道路。无论德国人民或是别国的人民都不能容忍这件事。
    “真理报”写道，爱好和平的各国人民过去和现在一直相信，德国工人阶级能够拿出力量来堵塞反动派的道路。日益增长的反对德国军国主义新的专横行动的人民抗议浪潮证明，德国人民已经开始意识到波恩政府采取的行动的全部致命意义。德国人民一定能够达到废除这个专横行动的目的，堵塞住反动派、法西斯主义和战争的道路。
    “真理报”最后写道，德国共产党过去曾经，今后仍要为伟大的目的、为德意志民族新的光明未来而斗争。全人类的进步力量都支持和同情德国共产党，一切国家爱好和平的力量都坚决反对西德军国主义的专横行动。
