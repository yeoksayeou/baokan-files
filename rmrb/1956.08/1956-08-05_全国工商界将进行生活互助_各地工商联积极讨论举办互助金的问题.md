Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd -- The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, based on the demands of industrialists and businessmen in various regions and for the purpose of mutual assistance and solidarity in times of difficulty, has passed a "Method (Draft) Regarding the Mutual Aid Fund for the Livelihood of Industrial and Commercial Circles" at its Fifth Standing Committee Meeting. The proposed sources of the mutual aid fund are as follows: private-sector employees in joint state-private enterprises contribute 1% of their actual monthly wages; private shareholders in joint state-private enterprises contribute 10% of their actual fixed interest; private-sector employees of joint state-private distribution, sales, and consignment businesses, self-employed individuals, small merchants, and individual handicraftsmen who have not joined cooperatives contribute on a voluntary basis according to their ability (the maximum amount not exceeding 1% of their monthly income); voluntary donations from individuals; and assistance from the government when necessary.

The main beneficiaries of the mutual aid are private-sector employees in joint state-private enterprises and private shareholders who are not yet employed, private-sector employees of joint state-private distribution, sales, and consignment businesses, self-employed individuals, small merchants, and individual handicraftsmen who have not joined cooperatives. The use of the mutual aid fund is divided into three categories: regular subsidies, temporary subsidies, and loans. Those whose actual income is insufficient to maintain their family life, resulting in frequent difficulties, will be given regular subsidies; those who encounter temporary difficulties will be given temporary subsidies; those whose actual income can maintain their family life, but who encounter temporary difficulties, will be given loans. This method also stipulates the principle of unified allocation and utilization of the mutual aid fund.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has also issued a notice, requesting the federations of industry and commerce of provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and counties to organize industrialists and businessmen to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions on the issue of establishing a mutual aid fund for living expenses, focusing on the sources of the mutual aid fund (such as whether it is appropriate to deduct 10% from the fixed interest of private shareholders), the unified national allocation and utilization of the fund, and the beneficiaries, etc., and to report the discussion opinions and implementation methods to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce for revision. At present, the federations of industry and commerce in various regions are actively展开ing discussions.

    全国工商界将进行生活互助
    各地工商联积极讨论举办互助金的问题
    新华社2日讯　中华全国工商业联合会根据各地工商业者的要求，为着工商业者发生困难的时候，本互助团结的精神进行互助起见，经中华全国工商业联合会第五次常务委员会通过了一个关于工商界生活互助金的办法（草案），互助金的来源拟议由公私合营企业私方实职人员按每月实得工资交纳1％；公私合营企业私股股东按实得定息交纳10％；公私合营的经销、代销户和自营户的资方实职人员、小商贩和未参加合作社的个体手工业者按自愿量力的原则交纳（最高额不超过每月收入的1％）；个人自愿赠送；必要时商请政府予以协助。
    互助的对象主要是公私合营企业私方实职人员和尚未就业的私股股东，公私合营的经销、代销户和自营户的资方实职人员、小商小贩以及未参加合作社的个体手工业者。互助金的使用分为经常性补助、临时性补助和借贷三种，凡实际收入不能维持家庭生活以致经常发生困难的，给予经常性补助；临时发生困难的，给予临时性补助；凡实际收入可以维持家庭生活，但是临时发生困难的，予以借贷。这个办法还规定了互助金统一调剂使用的原则。
    全国工商业联合会并发出通知，要求各省、市、自治区、县的工商业联合会，组织工商业者对举办生活互助金问题，就互助金来源、（如对私股股东从定息中抽出10％，是否适当）全国统一调剂使用及互助对象等等，进行广泛深入的讨论，并将讨论意见和进行办法，汇报全国工商业联合会总会修改。现在各地工商业联合会正在积极展开讨论中。
