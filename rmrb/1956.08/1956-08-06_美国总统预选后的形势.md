The situation after the US presidential primaries
Lin Longtie

    The quadrennial US election has concluded its primary phase. The Republican and Democratic Party state organizations have respectively selected delegates to attend the national conventions. Currently, both parties are actively preparing for their national conventions, to be held in mid-August, to further select presidential and vice-presidential candidates and formulate campaign platforms.

    **Cold Attitude of the American People**

    Judging from the reports in American newspapers and periodicals so far, a major feature of this year's primaries is the even more obvious indifference of voters compared to the previous election. The May 28th issue of "Time" magazine stated that in most states, less than half of the eligible voters participated in the voting. In Nebraska, only over 160,000 of the 800,000 eligible voters participated. On the one hand, bourgeois newspapers and politicians complain about the people's apathy and "lethargy" towards the election, but on the other hand, they hastily try to cover it up by saying that the people are "too busy" or "satisfied" with the status quo. In fact, the American people's attitude of indifference is precisely an expression of their lack of interest in and dissatisfaction with the policies of the two parties, who are birds of a feather.

    **The Republican Party's Only Trump Card**

    The Republican Party pins its only hope of defeating the Democratic Party on Eisenhower, hoping to achieve a double victory in the congressional and presidential elections through his prestige. In the presidential popularity polls in various states, Eisenhower received more votes than any Democratic candidate. However, American newspapers also point out that his prestige is not as great as before, and he received fewer votes than in the pre-election primaries of the previous election.

    Since Eisenhower suffered another illness in June, American newspapers believe that the Democratic Party will try to use Eisenhower's inability to handle the presidency as political capital to attack the Republican Party. At the same time, the Republican Party's vice-presidential candidate has become the focus of a struggle in the campaign, because if the president dies in office, the vice-president will naturally succeed according to the US Constitution. Currently, intense infighting has unfolded within the Republican Party on the issue of the vice-presidential candidate. This infighting became apparent after President Eisenhower's special assistant, Stassen, recently launched the "Dump Nixon" campaign. A group of Republican right-wing leaders actively support Nixon. However, some other Republican figures, including some in the White House, oppose nominating Nixon as the vice-presidential candidate. They worry that Nixon's reputation is too bad and will affect Eisenhower's votes, and they do not want to see Nixon take over the presidency if Eisenhower cannot continue to serve. Who will be the vice-presidential candidate now depends on the outcome of the competition at the Republican National Convention scheduled to be held on August 20.

    **The Democratic Party's Political Crisis**

    Because the Democratic Party does not have an opponent comparable to Eisenhower, not many people are confident and willing to participate in the election. The primaries were just a competition between Senator Kefauver and the previous Democratic presidential candidate, Stevenson. After Eisenhower fell ill again in June, New York Governor Harriman announced that he was willing to participate in the campaign at the Democratic National Convention. Currently, Stevenson has a greater advantage, but no one has received the number of supporting votes needed to be elected as the Democratic presidential candidate. The Democratic Party's inability to produce a candidate who can gain widespread support within the party is due not only to the fact that the Democratic Party has so far not been able to put forward a clear and powerful program that can compete with Eisenhower, but also to the existence of an internal split crisis. There is a serious division between the Southern Democrats, who represent the interests of racists and large farmers, and the Northern Democrats, who represent the Northern bourgeoisie and strive for urban workers, the middle class, and blacks as their voters. In order to gain the support of Southern Democrats, Stevenson has adopted a compromise attitude on issues such as racial discrimination. Therefore, Northern Democrats are hesitant to support him. Kefauver and Harriman have appeared as proponents of civil rights and opponents of racial discrimination, which the Southern Democrats oppose. Currently, some Democrats, led by Democratic Senate Leader Johnson, are plotting behind the scenes to elect a candidate that both sides can accept to reconcile the contradictions within the party. There will be a fierce quarrel at the Democratic National Convention, scheduled to open on August 13.

    **No Competition in Terms of Programs**

    The American people demand peace, demand that the government reduce taxes, and pay more attention to the people's welfare. The call for this is growing. In order to cater to this psychology of the people, the Republican Party is once again using the slogan of "peace and prosperity" to campaign this year. Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, Eisenhower has portrayed himself as a "flag-bearer of peace" in front of the American people, and the Republican Party has tried its best to tout the easing of international tensions over the past year as a "victory" for the Republican government's foreign policy. The Democratic Party criticizes the Republican Party's foreign policy errors for greatly reducing the international prestige of the United States, trying to gain political capital in this way. But in fact, the Eisenhower government's foreign policy is supported by the Democratic Party in Congress, and whether it is Stevenson or Harriman, apart from attacking the Republican Party's foreign policy as "unstable" and "weak" and continuing to advocate the bankrupt "policy of strength," there is nothing new. Therefore, even some bourgeois newspapers point out that there is no difference in the essence of the two parties' policies, and the American people are tired of this.

    The campaign strategists of both parties have pointed out that the shift in the attitudes of farmers, blacks, and laborers will be the key to winning this year's election. Therefore, the two parties are currently shifting the focus of their struggle to domestic issues. According to American newspaper reports, the Democratic Party is preparing to further use the recent shrinkage of automobile, steel, and other industrial production, the decline in farmers' income, and the increase in unemployment to attack the Republican Party's so-called "prosperity" slogan. In order to fight back against the Democratic Party, the Republican Political Committee published a booklet mocking the Democratic Party's feigned "sympathy" and "concern" for the suffering of the American people. It pointed out that many Democratic senators are billionaires, and presidential candidates Stevenson and Harriman have huge fortunes; moreover, in Congress, the Democrats have voted fourteen times in favor of increasing income tax...

    **Labor's Political Influence is Expanding**

    American bourgeois newspapers unanimously point out that after the merger of the two major American labor unions, the AFL and CIO, the influence of the unions' independent political action on elections is constantly expanding. As early as February, the AFL-CIO Executive Council put forward a struggle program to increase wages, reduce taxes, and protect democratic rights. The AFL-CIO Political Education Committee has raised activity funds and called on its local organizations to quickly establish political action committees in electoral districts and towns to carry out election-related propaganda, mobilize the masses, and strive to elect candidates supported by labor. In the Midwest, some local unions and farmer groups have established ties. AFL-CIO Vice President Reuther criticized the Republican Party for protecting big businesses and warned the Democratic Party that if it does not adopt New Deal and Fair Deal policies, labor will not support the Democratic Party this year. In order to reduce the role of unions in elections, some anti-labor bourgeois newspapers have promoted disunity within the unions and engaged in provocation. Some senators have openly proposed bills to Congress to declare union political activities illegal, and the US Department of Justice is also looking for excuses to restrict union political activities.

    **The Situation of Farmers is Unfavorable to the Republican Party**

    Although the agricultural population accounts for only 13% of the total US population, the twelve agricultural states in the Midwest have a significant impact on Congress and the general election.

    American farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy, and both parties want to use farmers' interests as bait to win farmers' votes. The agricultural bill, which was debated in Congress for half a year before being passed, is a prominent example of this struggle. The Republican Party wants to pass some measures to appease farmers, but the Democratic Party is trying to take full advantage of the Republican government's unfavorable position in this regard. The Democratic Party has been attacking the Republican government's agricultural policy, demanding that the subsidy prices for agricultural products be raised in this year's agricultural bill. It also rejected Eisenhower's request to pre-pay farmers "land bank" payments this year, saying it was a Republican Party "plan to buy votes in agricultural areas." The Democratic Party has taken advantage of farmers' dissatisfaction with the Republican government and has already won some farmer votes in the primaries. The July 1st issue of "US News & World Report" said that due to the continued decline in farmers' income, farmers' dissatisfaction with the Republican Party is growing, and farmers will become the Republican Party's number one problem.

     **Black Votes are Crucial**

    Despite the political exclusion of blacks by racists, black votes still occupy an important position in the election struggle. According to statistics, there are approximately six million black eligible voters, of which four million are distributed in important northern and western cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit. Black votes in these cities have a crucial impact on the elections in these key states. Especially in recent years, blacks have shown strong strength in the struggle against racial discrimination and for civil rights. Therefore, the role of blacks in this year's election has received great attention. At the end of June, the NAACP, a leading black movement organization, held a meeting in San Francisco, demanding that both parties take action to ensure the elimination of racial discrimination. As Southern Democrats intensify their persecution, including depriving blacks of the right to vote, blacks strongly demand that the Democratic Party adopt a program to protect black civil rights. In order to win black votes, the Republican Party has promoted the Supreme Court's nominal resolution to abolish racial segregation in public places as a "benevolent policy" for blacks.

    **The Demands of the People**

    The primaries not only showed the contrast in the strength of the two parties, but also reflected the people's strong demands for peace, civil rights, and economic welfare. The Communist Party of the United States pointed out in its May Day statement that the task of progressive forces is to defeat the cabinet of tycoons, defeat McCarthyites, and defeat Southern Democrats in the election, and to take independent political action to influence the election of the president and Congress. Despite the frenzied attacks of the American reactionary forces on progressive forces, organized workers, farmers, and blacks will have a significant impact on this year's election.

### 美国总统预选后的形势

    美国总统预选后的形势林龙铁
    四年一度的美国大选，已经结束了预选阶段。共和党和民主党的州组织，已分别选出了出席全国代表大会的代表。目前两党正在积极筹备将在八月中旬分别召开的全国代表大会，进一步选出正副总统候选人和拟订竞选纲领。
    美国人民态度冷淡
    从截至目前为止美国报刊报道的情况来看，今年预选一大特点，就是选民冷漠程度比上届选举更加明显。五月二十八日出版的“时代”周刊说，绝大部分的州参加投票的选民都不到半数，在内布拉斯加州，八十万合格的选民只有十六万多人参加投票。资产阶级报刊和两党政客一方面抱怨人民对选举冷淡和“迟钝”，但是又匆忙地以人民“太忙”或者对现状“满意”来掩饰。实际上，美国人民这种漠不关心的态度，正是他们对目前美国一丘之貉的两党的政策缺乏兴趣和感到不满的表示。
    共和党唯一的王牌
    共和党把战胜民主党的唯一希望寄托在艾森豪威尔身上，想通过他的声望在国会和总统选举中取得双重胜利。在各州总统声望测验中，艾森豪威尔得到票数超过任何民主党候选人。不过美国报刊也指出，他的声望已大不如前，得票比上届大选前的预选为少。
    由于六月间艾森豪威尔曾再度得病，美国报刊认为民主党将努力以艾森豪威尔身体不能胜任总统工作，来作为打击共和党的政治资本，同时共和党的副总统人选目前成为竞选运动中一个斗争的焦点，因为一旦总统出缺，按美国宪法副总统将当然继任。目前共和党内部已在副总统人选问题上，展开不同派系之间的剧烈倾轧。在总统特别助理史塔生最近发起“倒尼克松运动”之后，这一倾轧就表面化了。一批共和党右翼领袖积极支持尼克松。而另外一些共和党人士，包括白宫中的某些人物反对推尼克松当副总统候选人。他们担心尼克松名声太坏，会影响艾森豪威尔选票，并且他们不希望看到一旦艾森豪威尔不能继续任职时由尼克松接替总统。究竟谁当副总统候选人，现在要取决于定八月二十日召开的共和党全国代表大会上角逐的结果。
    民主党的政治危机
    民主党因为没有和艾森豪威尔旗鼓相当的对手，有信心愿意参加竞选的人不多。预选只是参议员克弗维尔和上届民主党总统候选人史蒂文森两人竞赛。在艾森豪威尔再次得病后，纽约州州长哈里曼才宣布愿意在民主党代表大会上参加竞选。目前以史蒂文森较占优势，但是谁也没有得到当选为民主党总统候选人所需要的支持票数。民主党不能产生一个能够得到党内普遍支持的候选人，除了由于民主党方面迄今没有一个人提得出鲜明有力的纲领，能以同艾森豪威尔相抗衡，还由于内部存在分裂危机。代表种族主义者和大农场主利益的南方民主党人，同代表北方资产阶级，而以城市工人、中产阶级和黑人为其争取的选民群众的北方民主党人之间，存在严重分歧。史蒂文森为了取得南方民主党人的支持，对种族歧视这类问题采取妥协态度，因此，北方民主党人对支持他有所犹豫。克弗维尔和哈里曼以拥护公民权利和反对种族歧视的姿态出现，南方民主党人反对他们。目前以民主党参议院领袖约翰逊为首的某些民主党人，正在幕后策划选出双方都能接受的候选人，以调和党内矛盾。预定八月十三日开幕的民主党全国代表大会上，将有一场激烈争吵。
    没有纲领方面的竞争
    美国人民要求和平、要求政府减税和多注意人民的福利。这方面的呼声日益高涨。为了投合人民这种心理，共和党今年再度以“和平与繁荣”的口号进行竞选。从日内瓦四国首脑会议以来，艾森豪威尔在美国人民面前把自己打扮成“和平旗手”，而共和党把一年来国际紧张局势的趋于和缓竭力吹嘘为共和党政府外交政策的“胜利”。民主党批评共和党外交政策的错误使美国国际威信大大降低，想这样来得到政治资本。但是事实上艾森豪威尔政府的外交政策在国会里是受到民主党支持的，而且不论史蒂文森或哈里曼，除攻击共和党外交政策“不坚定”和“软弱”，并继续鼓吹破产的“实力政策”外，别无新鲜内容。因此，连一些资产阶级报刊也指出，两党政策本质上并无区别，美国人民对这一套已经厌倦了。
    两党竞选策士们都指出，农民、黑人和劳工态度的转移，将是今年大选胜利关键，因此，目前两党把斗争重点转到国内问题上。据美国报刊报道，民主党准备进一步利用最近汽车、钢铁等工业生产萎缩、农民收入下降和失业人数增加的情况来攻击共和党的所谓“繁荣”的口号。为了还击民主党，共和党政治委员会出版了一本小册子，嘲笑民主党对美国人民疾苦的故作“同情”和“关心”。它指出，很多民主党参议员是亿万富翁，总统候选人史蒂文森和哈里曼都有巨大财产；而且在国会里，民主党人曾十四次投票赞成增加所得税……
    劳工的政治影响在扩大中
    美国资产阶级报刊一致指出，美国两大工会劳联和产联合并后，工会的独立政治行动对选举的影响不断扩大。早在二月间，劳联—产联执行理事会提出了一项增加工资、减税和保障民主权利的斗争纲领，劳联—产联的政治教育委员会已募捐了活动基金，并且号召它的地方组织，迅速在选区和城镇成立政治行动委员会，进行有关选举的宣传，动员群众，争取选出劳工支持的后选人。在中西部地区，一些地方工会和农民团体建立了联系。劳联—产联副主席路德抨击共和党袒护大企业，并且警告民主党说，如果不采取新政和公平施政方针，今年工会将不会支持民主党。为了缩小工会在选举中的作用，一些敌视劳工的资产阶级报刊大肆宣传工会内部不团结，并进行挑拨，某些参议员公然向国会提出宣布工会从事政治活动非法的法案，而美国司法部也正在寻找借口来限制工会的政治活动。
    农民的境况对共和党不利
    虽然农业人口只占美国总人口13％，但是美国中西部的十二个农业州，对国会和大选有重大影响。
    美国农民濒临破产边缘，两党都想以农民利益作钓饵来争取农民选票，在国会中争吵半年才获通过的农业法案，就是这种斗争的显著例子。共和党想通过一些安抚农民的措施，民主党却力图充分利用共和党政府在这方面的不利地位。民主党一直攻击共和党政府的农业政策，要求在今年农业法案中提高农产品补助价格，它还否决了艾森豪威尔提出今年预先发给农民“土地银行”付款的要求，说它是共和党“收买农业地区选票的计划”。民主党利用农民对共和党政府不满，在预选中已经争到了一些农民选票。七月份一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，由于农民收入继续下降，农民对共和党不满情绪在增长，农民将成为共和党第一号问题。
     黑人选票举足重轻
    尽管种族主义者在政治上排斥黑人，但是黑人的选票在竞选斗争中仍然居有重要地位。据统计，黑人合格选民约六百万，其中四百万分布在纽约、费城、芝加哥、底特律等北部和西部重要城市。这些城市的黑人选票，对这些关键性的大州的选举具有关键性的影响。特别是近年来，黑人在反对种族歧视、争取公民权利的斗争中显示了强大的力量，因此黑人在今年大选中的作用受到了很大的重视。六月底，黑人运动领导机构全国有色人种协进会在旧金山举行会议，要求两党必须以行动来保证消灭种族歧视现象。由于南方民主党人加紧采取包括剥夺黑人选举权的迫害行动，黑人强烈地要求民主党采取保障黑人公民权利纲领。为了拉拢黑人选票，共和党把最高法院关于取消公共场所种族隔离的有名无实的决议宣传为对黑人的一项“德政”。
    人民的要求
    预选不仅表示了两党力量的对比，同时也反映了人民对和平、公民权利和经济福利的强烈要求。美国共产党在五一节声明中曾指出，进步力量的任务是在大选中击败富豪内阁，击败麦卡锡主义者和击败南方民主党人，采取独立的政治行动来影响总统和国会的选举。尽管美国反动势力对进步力量猖狂进攻，有组织的工人、农民、黑人，对今年选举将产生重大影响。
