Korean People Build New Life

    Steel Production Rapidly Increases
    Since the "August 15th" Liberation, the steel industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has experienced rapid development. From 1946 to 1949, pig iron production increased more than fifty-five times, and steel production increased more than thirty-four times. During the three-year war of American aggression against Korea, the steel industry suffered severe damage. After the armistice, the Korean people actively engaged in restoration and reconstruction, and steel production rapidly recovered to pre-war levels and achieved further development. Steel production in 1955 increased by 1.5 times compared to 1954, and the steel production plan for the first half of this year has also been overfulfilled.
    
    Expanding the Ranks of Light Industry Technicians
    The number of engineers and technicians in various enterprises in the light industry sector of Korea has now increased to seven times that of the same period in 1952.
    Currently, the light industry sector is vigorously working to further expand the ranks of technical personnel. Ten technical schools and six workers' schools are training four thousand young workers to become technicians. In addition, more than ten thousand workers are studying in various technical training classes organized by light industry enterprises. Every year, several hundred new technicians trained by these training classes pass the national qualification examination.
    At the same time, more than a thousand Korean workers have gone to China to study advanced light industry technologies. This year, more than one hundred young workers have been sent to Chinese light industry enterprises for internships.
    
    Vigorously Develop Foreign Trade
    Korea's foreign trade volume in the first half of this year increased by 22% compared to the same period last year, and exports increased by 28% compared to the same period last year. Exports to the Soviet Union and China both increased by an average of more than 5% compared to the original plan. According to estimates by the Korean Ministry of Trade, this year's exports will increase by 60% compared to last year.
    In the past six months, large quantities of various non-ferrous metals, mineral products, and calcium carbide have been exported, as well as eleven new commodities such as caustic soda, granular iron, talc, various medicinal herbs, and peanuts.
    The Korean International Trade Promotion Committee recently held its third plenary session to discuss the issue of further expanding and developing Korea's foreign trade. The meeting decided to increase the number of committee members and expand the committee's organization.

    Irrigation Area Doubles
    After the liberation of northern Korea, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government implemented a policy of increasing grain production and vigorously carried out water conservancy and irrigation projects, resulting in a significant increase in irrigated area. Compared to 1946, when it was first liberated, the irrigated area in 1949 increased to 132%, and in 1956 it increased to 221.8%. At the same time, the area of land protected by the construction of river embankments and dikes increased to 328% of that in 1946 by the end of 1955. Due to the expansion of the water conservancy and irrigation area, grain production in northern Korea is continuously increasing.
    
    Publishing Industry Flourishes
    Korea's publishing industry has a long history. After the "August 15th" Liberation, the publishing industry in the north experienced rapid revival and development. Compared to 1946, newspaper circulation in 1955 increased to 253%, magazine circulation increased to 2,537%, and the number of copies of various books published increased to 1,116%. The tremendous development of publishing work is a clear indication of the increasing cultural level of the Korean people.

    朝鲜人民建设新生活
    钢铁产量迅速增长
    自“八·一五”解放后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的钢铁工业获得飞速的发展。从1946年到1949年间，铣铁产量增长到五十五倍以上，钢产量增长到三十四倍以上。在美国侵略朝鲜的三年战争期间，钢铁工业遭到严重的破坏。停战后，朝鲜人民积极从事恢复和重建工作，钢铁产量迅速地恢复到战前水平，并获得进一步的发展。1955年钢铁产量比1954年增加了一点五倍，今年上半年的钢铁生产计划也已超额完成。
    扩大轻工业技术人员队伍
    朝鲜轻工业方面各企业中的工程师和技术员的人数现在已经增加为1952年同时期的七倍。
    现在轻工业部门正在大力进行工作来进一步扩大技术人员的队伍。有十个技术学校和六个工人学校正在训练四千个青年工人成为技术人员。此外，还有一万多工人正在轻工业企业所主办的各种技术训练班学习。每年有好几百由这些训练班训练出来的新技术人员通过国家的资格审查考试。
    同时，已经有一千多朝鲜工人到中国去学习轻工业方面的高级技术。今年又有一百多青年工人已经被派到中国轻工业企业中去实习。
    大力发展对外贸易
    朝鲜今年上半年的对外贸易额比去年同期增加了22％，输出额比去年同期增加了28％，对苏联和中国的输出额都比原计划平均增加了5％以上。据朝鲜贸易省估计，今年的输出额将比去年增加60％。
    在这半年中，大量出口的有各种有色金属、矿产品和电石等，另外还有苛性钠、粒铁、滑石、各种药草、落花生等十一种新货品。
    朝鲜国际贸易促进委员会最近举行了第三次全体会议，讨论进一步扩大和发展朝鲜的对外贸易的问题。会议决定增加委员会的委员并且扩大委员会的组织。
    灌溉面积增加两倍
    朝鲜北部解放后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府实施了增产谷物的政策，大力进行了水利灌溉工程，灌溉面积有了很大的增长。同1946年刚解放时相比，1949年的灌溉面积增加到132％，1956年则增加到221.8％，同时，由于兴修河川堤防而得到扩大的土地保护面积，到1955年底增加为1946年的328％。由于水利灌溉面积的扩大，朝鲜北部的谷物产量正在不断增长。
    出版事业繁荣
    朝鲜的出版事业有着悠久的历史。“八·一五”解放后，北部的出版事业得到迅速的复兴和发展。同1946年比较，1955年报纸发行数增长到253％，杂志发行数增长到2，537％，各种书籍发行部数增长到1，116％。出版工作的巨大发展，是朝鲜人民文化水平日益提高的鲜明标志。
