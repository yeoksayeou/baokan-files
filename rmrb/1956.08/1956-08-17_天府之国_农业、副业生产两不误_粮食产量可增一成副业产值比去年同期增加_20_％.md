Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 15th. Sichuan Province, known as the "Land of Abundance," is now showing signs of a bumper harvest everywhere in the countryside. If there are no unexpected disasters, the province's more than 53 million mu of rice and more than 24 million mu of corn will have good harvests again. According to predictions from various places, the province's total grain output will increase by about 10% compared to the bumper year of 1955.

Currently, Sichuan farmers are not only stepping up field management to ensure a bumper harvest, but are also actively preparing for the autumn harvest. This year, the province's double-cropping rice planting area has expanded significantly compared to last year, and a season of late autumn crops will also be planted. Rural sideline production has also increased compared to last year. Therefore, the autumn harvest period is characterized by simultaneous harvesting and planting, numerous and complex agricultural tasks, and a long and intense period. In order to fight this battle of the autumn harvest well, agricultural cooperatives in various places have formulated comprehensive autumn harvest and planting work plans and labor organization and deployment plans. Agricultural cooperatives in the Yibin Special District have universally established specialized autumn harvest and planting teams based on the strengths of their members; these teams contract for agricultural work and are rewarded for exceeding quotas. Some places in the Leshan Special District have already drafted labor adjustment and mutual assistance plans between cooperatives, between cooperatives and farmers outside the cooperatives, and between hilly areas and plains areas.

Reducing waste and striving to bring every grain home is another key focus of the autumn harvest preparation work for farmers in Sichuan Province this year. Currently, most parts of the province are carrying out publicity activities to reduce waste by carefully calculating accounts. Many agricultural cooperatives in the Yibin, Luzhou, and Nanchong Special Districts have held special meetings to exchange experiences in reducing waste during the autumn harvest and to organize members to learn techniques for reducing waste.

In addition, various places have also carried out a lot of work in terms of material preparation for the autumn harvest and planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 15th. More than 200,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province are vigorously developing diversified operations without weakening agricultural production, in order to strive for more than 90% of their members to increase their income compared to last year after the autumn harvest. According to recent reports from various places, the types of sideline businesses operated by agricultural cooperatives across the province have increased compared to last year, and the total output value of various sideline businesses has generally increased by about 20% compared to the same period last year.

The Nanchong Special District, where sideline production is developing well, currently has a total number of pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, fish, etc., that has increased by 28% to several times compared to the end of last year. The more than one million agricultural cooperative members in this special district earned more than 3 million yuan from transportation income and household sideline and handicraft production from April to July this year, which is also a considerable increase compared to the same period last year. In Pingwu County, Mianyang Special District, located in a mountainous area, the income from sideline businesses and local specialties is expected to reach more than 5.75 million yuan this year, which is equivalent to 90% of the county's agricultural output value this year. This year, the 241 agricultural cooperatives in this county have collectively managed more than 310 types of economic forests, and the total output value will increase by more than half compared to last year.

After agricultural cooperatives in various places paid attention to developing diversified operations, many sideline businesses and small handicraft productions that had not been operated or had shrunk in the past have gradually recovered or developed. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, members of the Shi'an Agricultural Cooperative in Liangping County operated a total of 106 household sideline businesses and small handicraft industries, which gradually shrank and decreased over the years, leaving only a dozen types by last year. This year, after vigorous support, the income of members of this cooperative from sideline businesses such as chicken raising has exceeded the highest level in history, and 19 sideline businesses such as fish farming, beekeeping, sugar workshops, medicinal materials, and miscellaneous fruits have reached the highest annual production level in history. It is estimated that the sideline income of each member household this year can reach more than 80 yuan.

When developing diversified operations, agricultural cooperatives in various places generally established and improved organizations within the cooperatives to manage sideline production, formulated sideline production plans for the cooperatives and individual members in accordance with local conditions, arranged agricultural and sideline tasks for each agricultural season, and adjusted labor organizations, so as to ensure that the cooperative's agricultural production and the members' household sideline production were not delayed.

    “天府之国”农业、副业生产两不误
    粮食产量可增一成副业产值比去年同期增加20％
    新华社成都15日电　号称“天府之国”的四川省，现在农村中到处呈现丰收的景象。如果没有意外的灾害，全省五千三百多万亩水稻和两千四百多万亩玉米又将有良好的收成。根据各地预测，全省粮食总产量将比丰收的1955年增产一成左右。
    目前四川省农民除加紧进行田间管理工作，以保证丰收外，已经紧张地展开了秋收的准备工作。今年全省双季稻种植面积比去年扩大很多，还要增种一季晚秋作物。农村副业生产也比去年增加。因此，秋收期间又收又种，农活多而复杂，时间长而紧张。各地农业社为了打好秋收这一仗，纷纷制定了全面的秋收秋种工作计划和劳动力组织调配计划。宜宾专区各农业社依据社员特长，普遍成立秋收秋种的专业小组；由专业小组向社承包农活，超额给奖。乐山专区有些地方已经拟定出社和社、社和社外农民以及丘陵区和平坝区之间的劳动力调剂互助方案。
    减少抛撒，争取颗粒还家，是今年四川省农民秋收准备工作的另一重点。现在，全省大部分地区正在用算细账的方式，展开了减少抛撒的宣传活动。宜宾、泸州、南充等专区的许多农业社专门召开会议，交流了在秋收中减少抛撒的经验，组织社员学习减少抛撒的技术。
    此外，各地在秋收秋种的物资准备方面，也进行了许多工作。
    新华社成都15日电　四川省二十多万个农业生产合作社，在不削弱农业生产的条件下，正在大力展开多种经营，以争取今年秋收后90％以上的社员比去年增加收入。根据各地最近的报告，全省农业社经营的副业种类，已比去年有所增加，各种副业的总产值一般也比去年同期增加了20％左右。
    副业生产开展得较好的南充专区，目前饲养的猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、兔、鱼等的总数，分别比去年年底增加了28％到几倍。这个专区的一百多万户农业社社员，今年四至七月的运输收入和家庭副业、手工业生产收入，共达三百多万元，比去年同期也增加了不少。地处山区的绵阳专区平武县，今年全县经营的副业和土特产的收入预计可达到五百七十五万多元，相当于今年全县农业产值的90％。这个县的二百四十一个农业社，今年集体经营的经济林木就有三百一十多种，总产值将比去年增加一半以上。
    各地农业社注意开展多种经营后，许多过去没有经营或者萎缩了的副业和小手工业生产，已经逐渐恢复或开展起来。梁平县世安农业社社员，在抗日战争前，共经营了一百零六项家庭副业和小手工业，后来逐年萎缩消减，到去年只剩十余种。今年经过大力扶助，目前这个社社员养鸡等副业的收入已超过了历史上的最高水平，养鱼、养蜂、糖坊、药材、杂果等十九项副业已达到了历史上最高年产水平，预计今年每户社员的副业收入，可达八十元以上。
    各地农业社在展开多种经营时，一般都建立和健全了社内管理副业生产的组织，因地制宜地制订了社的和社员个人的副业生产计划，安排了各个农事季节的农、副业活路和调整了劳动力组织，作到了社的农业生产和社员家庭副业生产两不误。
