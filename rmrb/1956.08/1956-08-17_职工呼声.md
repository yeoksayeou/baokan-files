Voices of the Workers

The Qianjin Coking Plant Shows a Lack of Concern for Workers

The Qianjin Coking Plant in Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, does not care about the well-being of its workers. Labor protection work here is very poor. Work shoes and gloves are essential labor protection items for workers in the coking workshop, but the factory insists on issuing work shoes only once every six months and gloves once a month. In reality, work shoes only last three or four months, and gloves only last half a month. Because this problem has not been resolved, burns and crushing accidents occur frequently.

The living conditions of the workers are even more unsatisfactory. Xia Zengqiang and Zhang Changxun's wives are both young and have children, but they are forced to live in the same room. Some cadre couples live in the same room with their nannies. Is the Qianjin Coking Plant truly having difficulty resolving the housing problem for its workers? No, we know that some houses have been vacant for four or five months. We have also suggested using some materials to divide a large room into two smaller rooms to make it more convenient for workers to live in. At that time, the leadership readily agreed to solve the problem, but more than two months have passed, and the problem remains.

We hope that the Qianjin Coking Plant will correct this tendency of not caring about the well-being of its workers.　　Liu Shui

Let Me Drive Tractors for Life

I am a tractor driver in the Third Detachment of the Mechanical Road Construction Team of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. We build railways in the border areas all year round, living in single tents. These single tents are freezing in winter and scorching in summer. We have already spent three summers in these single tents. Many people cannot bear the heat and cannot sleep, some suffer from insomnia, and some suffer from neurasthenia.

For several years, the leaders of the Third Engineering Bureau have not solved our housing problem, only asking us to overcome difficulties, but when will we be able to overcome them? When more than a hundred of us were first transferred here, we were all very strong, but now more than a dozen comrades have been transferred to other jobs because of poor health and being unsuitable for driving tractors. I love my job and don't want to suffer the same fate. I hope the leadership can quickly solve our housing problem, so that I and many comrades like me can be companions to tractors for life.　　Yi Feng

This Way of Collecting Electricity Fees Is Unreasonable

The Yunyang County Power Plant in Sichuan Province supplies electricity for lighting to all residents of the city. Residents here pay a fixed price of 1.44 yuan per lamp per month for electricity. Due to the unreasonable method of calculating electricity prices, there is a lot of waste of electricity. Every night, regardless of whether there is anything to do or not, users keep their lights on until midnight; especially when large meetings are held during the day, because microphones are needed at the venue, the power plant has to supply power, and all the lights in the city turn on as well. No one has ever calculated how much electricity is wasted. We hope that the relevant departments will change the charging method.

    职工呼声
    前进炼焦厂对职工不关心
    云南省富源县前进炼焦厂不关心职工疾苦。这里的劳动保护工作做得很差。焦炉车间工人需要的工鞋和手套是生产上必不可少的劳动保护用品，厂里硬规定工鞋半年发一双，手套一个月发一双。实际上工鞋只能穿三、四个月，手套只能用半个月。由于这个问题没有解决，不断地发生烫伤和砸伤事故。
    职工的居住条件更不能令人满意。夏增强、张长逊两人的妻子都很年轻，并且有孩子，硬叫他们住在一间房子里。有的干部夫妇和媬姆住在一间房里。前进炼焦厂的房子是不是真有困难，不能解决职工的房子问题呢？不，据我们知道就有一些房子空了四、五个月还没有人住。我们也曾经建议用些工料将一大间房子隔成两小间，让职工们住起来方便些。当时领导上满口答应解决，但是两个多月的时间过去了，问题还是问题。
    希望前进炼焦厂纠正这种不关心职工疾苦的偏向。　　刘水
    让我终身驾驶拖拉机
    我是铁道部第三工程局机械筑路队三分队的拖拉机手。我们常年在边疆地区建设铁路，住的是单帐棚。这种单帐棚冬天冻个死，夏天热个死。我们已经在这种单帐棚里过了三个夏季了。许多人热得受不了，睡不着觉，有的得了失眠症，有的得了神经衰弱病。
    几年来，第三工程局领导上一直没有解决我们的住宅问题，只是要我们克服困难，但我们要克服到什么时候才有头呢？我们一百多人初调到这里来的时候，身体都很强壮，现在已经有十几个同志因为身体不好、不适合开拖拉机而调做别的工作了。我热爱自己的工作，不愿意遭到同样的命运。希望领导上能很快地解决我们的住宅问题，让我和许多同我一样的同志，能够终身做拖拉机的伴侣。　　一风
    这样收电费不合理
    四川省云阳县有个发电厂供应全城居民照明用电。这里居民用电是按一盏灯一个月一元四角四分固定价格计算的。由于计算电价的方法不合理，电力浪费很大。每天晚上不问有事无事，用户的电灯都点到午夜十二点钟；特别是在白天召开大会的时候，因为会场上需用麦克风，电厂就得供应电源，全城的电灯都跟着亮起来。究竟浪费了多少电，这个帐从来没有人算过。希望有关方面改变收费办法。
