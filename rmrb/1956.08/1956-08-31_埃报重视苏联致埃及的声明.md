    埃报重视苏联致埃及的声明
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社开罗29日讯：所有报纸都以头条大字标题刊载了苏联政府就苏彝士运河问题致埃及共和国政府的声明。这个声明是昨天由苏联驻埃及大使基谢廖夫转交给埃及总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔的。各报刊都着重指出了声明中这样一部分：苏彝士问题的任何解决办法都应当符合联合国的原则和宪章，都应当首先尊重埃及作为运河的全权主人、所有者和管理者的主权。
    “人民报”在“埃及是运河的全权主人，只有它一国有权管理它”的标题下刊载了这个声明的全文。
    “埃及日报”的头条通栏标题是：“苏联认为埃及政府是运河的全权主人”
    “消息报”也写道：“俄国宣布，埃及是运河的所有者，这个事实应当成为苏彝士问题的任何解决的基础”。
