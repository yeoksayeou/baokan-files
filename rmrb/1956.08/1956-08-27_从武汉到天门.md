    From Wuhan to Tianmen
    Wang Yanzhi, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    This time, my inspection in Hubei Province is mainly focused on overseas Chinese affairs. Specifically, I want to understand the situation of overseas Chinese hometowns and families, as well as the employment of returned overseas Chinese.

    Regarding the situation of returned overseas Chinese, we conducted individual interviews and attended symposiums during our short stay in Wuhan to gain some understanding.

    It is said that there are more than 700 returned overseas Chinese in Wuhan, most of whom are from India, Indonesia, Burma, Malaya, and Thailand. They are all patriotic. They are contributing their strength in various positions. Among them, seventy or eighty have been recognized as labor models or advanced workers, accounting for more than 10% of all employed returned overseas Chinese.

    Does this mean they are all so hardworking? Not really! Things are not that simple. Just think: a group of overseas Chinese who have just returned to New China, can their living habits and ways of thinking be completely consistent with ours without any distance? Impossible! Taking the most common ideological consciousness as an example, you say labor comes first, he says enjoyment is important; you advocate collective life, he emphasizes individual "freedom." In short, they use old standards to measure new things, thus creating a gap in life and emotions. This is one of the reasons why some returned overseas Chinese are not at ease with their work.

    A returned overseas Chinese named Zhang from Thailand told me: It cannot be said that some returned overseas Chinese are not concerned about wages and benefits, but most are concerned about political and emotional treatment. Taking himself as an example, although comrades constantly gave him patient education, he was still not enthusiastic about his work at first, made trouble, and was passively resisting work. Later, comrades helped and took care of him in various ways, and he was moved and became active. Recently, he was named an advanced worker and received a meritorious service medal. This example shows that it is not enough to patiently educate returned overseas Chinese; we must also help and take care of them to move them and make them active.

    Another returned overseas Chinese from Japan, Wu Dongchai, used to study polymer chemistry in Japan. He returned to China in 1953 and was assigned to work at the Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory. At that time, he felt that he was not using what he had learned and could not give full play to his expertise, so he was unhappy. Coupled with the unfamiliarity of life, he became less and less enthusiastic about his work, to the point of pessimism, disappointment, and not knowing what to do. Until the year before last, when Wuhan was threatened by floods, everyone was busy rescuing, he personally witnessed the thrilling scene of fighting the flood and the heroic behavior of many heroic models. At this time, he realized the greatness of the masses and the insignificance of the individual, and firmly believed that the future of the motherland was bright. He thought: Although we are suffering now, we will surely be happy in the future. Therefore, his mind opened up and he became active in his work. Recently, he invented a method of "ion exchange resin."

    Wu Dongchai's example shows that in this great era, many negative factors will be replaced by positive factors, and many backward elements will be led forward by the advanced. Returned overseas Chinese are also like this. The question is how to more consciously unite and educate them – including paying attention to some educational methods and approaches.

    Let me talk about the general situation of overseas Chinese hometowns and families in Hubei.

    Overseas Chinese hometowns in Hubei are almost all concentrated in Tianmen County. There are several "wan" (villages) there, such as Majiawan, Yijiawan, Xiaojiawan, and Liujiawan, which are all overseas Chinese hometowns spanning more than 20 li. Especially Liujiawan, the population of overseas Chinese families accounts for more than 70% of the total population of the village. There are more than 1,600 households and more than 6,000 people of overseas Chinese families in the county, and more than 2,000 households and more than 10,000 people living abroad. The distribution areas are: India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaya, etc.

    In the past, there was an old saying in Tianmen County: "Tianmen Mianyang Continent, nine out of ten years of crop failure," which shows that there were frequent disasters here, and the people's lives were very hard. Overseas Chinese were probably forced to go abroad to make a living due to disasters. The vast majority of them are farmers. After returning from abroad, they still engage in agricultural production and live the life of farmers. Therefore, unlike the returned overseas Chinese and their families in Fujian and Guangdong, they do not rely on remittances from overseas Chinese.

    Now, more than 90% of farmers in Tianmen County have joined advanced cooperatives, including overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese. Among them, there is a Xiao Zhilu, who used to be a landlord. He went abroad before liberation, and now his sister-in-law and nephews are still in Indonesia, and he maintains economic relations with them. Therefore, he is both an overseas Chinese family member and a returned overseas Chinese. It is said that since the land reform, he has actively participated in production, so his class status has changed, his landlord hat has been removed, and he has recently been approved to join the advanced cooperative. We heard this news at the overseas Chinese family symposium in Qianyi Town and decided to visit him. He lives in Xiaojiawan, about ten li from Qianyi Town. We walked there and stopped in front of a courtyard.

    "Comrade Xiao Zhilu," a comrade who accompanied us to the countryside shouted, and a young man immediately responded. He was in his twenties and very strong. Behind him was an old lady with white hair and wrinkled skin, who was Xiao Zhilu's mother.

    "Old lady, how is your life going?" As she was busy getting teacups and moving benches, I stopped her and chatted with her about life. She kept saying it was good, better than before. This made me a little unbelievable. Was she deliberately being perfunctory with me? No! Guessing my psychology, she started talking endlessly.

    It turned out that her family used to be poor too. When Hubei suffered a major flood in 1935, their lives were even harder. Fortunately, her eldest son, Xiao Zhiman, returned from Indonesia and spent more than 2,000 yuan to buy her hundreds of acres of land, so she became a landlord. At that time, Xiao Zhilu was still young. She rented out most of the land and cultivated ten or so acres herself, hoping that her family could live a better life. Who knew it wouldn't be so. Because she had more land, she had to pay taxes and levies for everything: today she had to pay money for repairing dikes and dams, tomorrow she had to donate military salaries for the relocation of troops, and the day after tomorrow she had to buy guns for joint defense against rampant bandits - in fact, the bandits were not as fierce as "128." Speaking of this, her son added that the so-called "128" was the "128th" division of the Kuomintang army stationed there at the time, and the division commander Wang Jinzai was an expert at plundering the people. Mentioning him, the old lady gritted her teeth even more. She angrily rolled up her sleeves and showed me the arm that still had scars from being beaten that year. She said, "In those days, you don't even think about living a good life, because that gang of robbers fattened themselves by extorting the people." When she said "in those days," she was of course referring to the dark age of reactionary rule, which she hated. But what about at this time, in the present? I encouraged her to say more, and she continued very logically. She said: "When there is nothing to eat, you only worry about eating; when you have something to eat, you have to worry about officials, soldiers, robbers, bandits, floods, and droughts. Finally, we have endured until now, until today when we are liberated, and everything we used to worry about can be discarded. What could be better?" I also asked her if joining the agricultural cooperative would make life better. She was counting on her fingers, wanting to calculate the details with me, but her son, Xiao Zhilu, who had been silent for a long time, immediately answered for her mother: The most important benefit of the cooperative is increased production. In the past, when we farmed our own land, we could only harvest 480 jin per mu, but now we can harvest more than 1,000 jin, more than double. Therefore, the old saying should be changed to "Tianmen Mianyang Continent, ten years of harvest." May I ask, if you don't join the cooperative, how can production be improved so quickly? This is the superiority of the cooperative. Anyone who is not blind can see it. I asked him how many workdays he could do each month now and how much money he could get. He said that this month - less than a month, he and his wife had already done more than fifty workdays. In addition, they can also engage in some sideline businesses such as repairing dikes and fishing. His family of five now has more than enough to live on without relying on remittances from overseas Chinese. Therefore, he wrote to advise his sister-in-law and nephews to return and participate in construction. He said that the motherland is progressing too fast. If you don't come back sooner, I'm afraid you won't be able to keep up. I asked him if other overseas Chinese families felt the same way. He answered in the affirmative. However, he also said that if everyone came back, the population of Xiaojiawan would expand, and China would seem even bigger. Everyone laughed.

    From this visit, we roughly saw the changes taking place in the countryside, especially the changes taking place among overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese in the cooperativization movement. We were very satisfied with the inspection.

### 从武汉到天门

    从武汉到天门
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员　王炎之
    我这次到湖北视察，主要以侨务工作为对象。具体说，就是想了解一些侨乡侨眷情况和归侨就业的情况。
    关于归侨的情况，我们在逗留武汉的短短几天中，曾作个别访问，参加座谈会，进行了了解。
    据说，武汉有归侨七百多人，其中以来自印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、马来亚及泰国的为最多。他们都是爱国的。他们正分别在各个岗位上贡献自己的力量。他们之中被评为劳动模范或先进工作者的有七、八十人，占全体就业归侨的10％以上。
    这是不是说他们都那么努力了呢？也不是的！事情不会那么简单。试想想：一群刚从国外回到新中国的侨胞，他们的生活习惯，思想方法，能够完全和我们一致而没有距离的吗？不可能的！拿最一般的思想意识来说，你说劳动第一，他说享受重要，你提倡集体生活，他强调个人“自由”。总而言之，他们用旧的尺度来衡量新的事物，从而在生活和情感上有了一道鸿沟。这是某些归侨不安心于工作的原因之一。
    有一个从泰国回来的姓张的华侨告诉我说：我们归侨斤斤计较工资待遇的，不能说没有，但最多的是计较政治待遇和人情待遇，拿他自己来说，虽然同志们对他不断进行耐心教育，最初仍然对工作不够热心，闹情绪，消极怠工。以后同志们又从各方面帮助他，照顾他，他受到了感动，才积极起来。最近，他被评为先进工作者，得到了功臣奖章。这个事例说明对归侨光耐心进行教育还不够，还要帮助、照顾他们，才能使他们感动而积极起来。
    另外有一个日本归侨吴东侪，他曾在日本研究高分子化学。1953年回国，被分配到武汉制药厂工作。当时他觉得学非所用，不能发挥专长，因而悒悒不乐。加上生活的不习惯，工作就越不起劲，以至于悲观失望，徬徨不知所从。直到前年，当武汉受洪水威胁，大家都忙着抢救，他亲眼看到了这幕惊心动魄同洪水斗争的紧张情景和许多英雄模范的英勇行为，这时候他才体会到群众的伟大和个人的渺小，并深信祖国的前途是光明的。他想：尽管眼前吃苦，日后必然得到幸福。因此，他的思想开朗了，工作也就积极起来，最近并发明了一种“离子交换树脂”的方法。
    吴东侪的例子说明：在这大时代里面，有许多消极因素将被积极因素所代替，有许多落后的也将被先进的带向前进。归侨也是这样，问题是如何更有意识地团结教育他们——包括讲究一些教育的方法方式。
    我再谈谈湖北侨乡和侨眷的概况。
    湖北侨乡几乎全部集中在天门县。那里有几个“湾”（村），如马家湾、易家湾、萧家湾、刘家湾等，纵横二十余里都是侨乡。尤其是刘家湾，侨眷人口占全村人口的70％以上。全县侨眷有一千六百多户，六千余人，侨居国外的有二千多户一万多人。分布地区是：印度，印度尼西亚，缅甸，泰国，越南，菲律宾及马来亚等。
    从前天门县有句老话：“天门沔阳洲，十年九不收”，说明这里常闹灾荒，老百姓生活很苦。华侨恐怕也是被灾荒所迫出国谋生的。他们绝大多数是农民，从国外归来之后还从事农业生产，过农民的生活。因此不像闽粤归侨、侨眷有依靠侨汇生活的。
    现在，天门县农民加入高级合作社的达90％以上，侨眷、归侨也包括在内。其中有个萧志禄，过去是地主。他在解放前出过国，现在他的嫂嫂侄儿还在印度尼西亚，和他保持着经济关系。因此他是侨眷，也是归侨。听说他从土地改革以来就积极地参加生产，因此他的阶级成分改变了，他的地主帽子被摘掉了，最近又被批准加入高级合作社。我们在亁驿镇开侨眷座谈会时听到这消息，决定去访问他。他住在萧家湾，距亁驿镇约十里路。我们步行到了那里，在一所院子前面停留下来。
    “萧志禄同志”一个陪我们下乡的工作同志喊着，立刻有个后生应声而出。他二十多岁年纪，长得很结实。后面跟着一个鹤髮鸡皮的老大娘，她是萧志禄的母亲。
    “老大娘，你们生活过得怎样？”当她忙着拿茶碗、搬板凳的时候，我拉住她，和她聊起生活。她满口说好，说比以前的都好。使我有点不敢相信，难道她故意和我敷衍吗？不是的！她猜着我的心理，于是滔滔不绝地谈起来。
    原来她家过去也是穷苦的。1935年湖北闹大水灾的时候，她们生活得就更苦了。幸亏她的大儿子萧志曼从印度尼西亚回来，花了两千多元，给她买下百把亩田地，这样她就成了地主。那时候萧志禄还小，她把大部分土地租出去，自己耕种了十来亩，指望一家生活过得好些。谁知不然。因为她的土地多了，样样要科派她：今天为修堤筑坝，向她要钱，明天为军队移防，向她捐饷，后天又为土匪猖獗要她买枪枝来共同防御——其实哩，土匪还没有它“一二八”那么凶恶。说到这里，她的儿子补充说，所谓“一二八”就是当时国民党驻军第“一二八”师，师长王劲哉是个刮地皮老手。提起他，老大娘更是咬牙切齿。她愤愤地卷起袖子，露出当年她被打至今还残留着伤疤的胳臂给我看。她说：“在那时候，你休想过好日子，因为那班强盗就是敲诈老百姓养肥的。”她说的“在那时候”，当然指的是反动统治的黑暗时代，是她所厌恶的。但是在这时候，在现在又怎样？我鼓励她多说说，她就很有条理地继续谈下去。她说：“没有吃的时候只愁吃；有得吃的时候却要愁官，愁兵，愁强盗，愁土匪，愁水灾，愁旱灾。好容易挨到现在，挨到解放了的今天，一切从前可愁的都可以丢掉，还有什么更好的呢？”我又问她，参加了农业合作社，是不是生活会更好呢？她正在屈指，想和我算一算细账，可是她的儿子，沉默了很久的萧志禄却马上代她娘回答说：合作社最主要的好处是增产，从前自家种田，每亩只能收四百八十斤，现在可以收到一千斤以上，增加了一倍多。因此，从前那句老话，应该改为“天门沔阳洲，十年十丰收”了。试问不加入合作社，生产那能提高这样快？这就是合作社的优越性，不是瞎子，谁也能看得到的。我问他现在每月能做多少劳动日，可得多少钱？他说这个月——不到一个月，他夫妻俩已经做了五十多个劳动日，此外还可以搞些副业如修堤捞鱼等，一家五口，现在不靠侨汇，生活已绰绰有余，因此他写信劝告他的嫂侄回来参加建设。他说祖国进步的太快了，不早日回来，恐怕跟不上。我问他其他侨眷是不是也有同感？他回答是肯定的。不过，他又说，如果大家都回来了，萧家湾人口将膨胀起来，中国就显得更大了。说得大家都笑起来。
    从这一访问，我们约略看到了农村中所起的变化，尤其是侨眷、归侨在合作化运动中所起的变化。我们视察后感到非常满意。
