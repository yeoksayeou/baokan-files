    Support On-the-Job Youth Advancing Towards Science
    Gu Junzheng
    To support on-the-job youth in their advancement towards science, it is necessary to compile a set of introductory books for self-study in various subjects.
    Currently, the majority of on-the-job youth, with the exception of a small number of university graduates, have education levels ranging from junior high school to the first or second year of senior high school. These young people are advancing towards science not to engage in academic research, nor to pursue a doctorate, but to improve their cultural and professional skills in line with the needs of their work, to learn basic scientific knowledge, and to create preconditions for better utilizing their personal abilities. Since they all have jobs, their studies must be conducted in their spare time. In terms of learning conditions, they differ from students in school. Although they have the desire to advance towards science, they lack guidance; although they know that learning science requires gradual progress, they cannot find appropriate introductory books in various subjects that progress from the simple to the profound.
    While there are many popular science books suitable for junior and senior high school levels in bookstores, most of these books are only for reading and browsing, not for in-depth study and self-improvement.
    Now, focusing solely on various popular natural science books, they can be roughly divided into the following two types:
    One type introduces great scientific achievements, such as most of Il'in's works. These books explain to readers how humanity uses science to transform the world, and also point out the beautiful prospects of a communist society built on a highly technical foundation. Their main role is to publicize the enormous power of mankind after mastering science and technology, using concrete and vivid facts to call on readers to advance towards science. This type of book can give self-studying youth encouragement, but it cannot satisfy their further demands—how to find the path to advance.
    Another type is supplementary reading material for school textbooks. Some use vivid language, rich examples, and appropriate metaphors to provide detailed and simple explanations of certain scientific problems, such as Il'in's "Journey to the Atomic World," Belman's "Cycloid," Yakupenko's "The Story of Digestion," and Gol'son's "The Adventures of Fruits and Seeds." Some pose interesting questions based on certain phenomena in daily life, guiding readers to think carefully and helping them solve these problems using simple scientific principles, such as most of Perelman's works and Gale's "Wanderings in the Physical World." This type of book is based on the reader's existing scientific knowledge. Their main role is to consolidate this knowledge and apply it. However, although they guide readers to take various short trips within their existing knowledge domains, allowing readers to appreciate the famous historical sites along the way, they do not guide readers to cross this boundary, gradually delve deeper on the path to advancement, and climb the peaks of science.
    Of course, this is not to say that these popular science books are of no help to self-studying youth. On the contrary, they are the best companions for young people on the road to advancing towards science. When young people start learning science, they should read more popular supplementary reading materials and listen to more popular lectures; but since they want to advance towards science, they must not rely solely on this kind of effortless learning, always circling around the original knowledge base. Learning science should not only emphasize "orderly progress" but also strive for "advancement"; not only should it involve frequent "reviewing the old," but also continuous "knowing the new." We can understand this principle after reading the hard-working study experience of Comrade Xu Renwu from the Shandong Chemical Plant.
    Comrade Xu Renwu told us that when he started self-study, he was just a janitor "with a primary school education and lacking basic scientific knowledge," but in a short period of six years (1946 to 1952), he became a national construction talent with professional knowledge and capable of independent work thanks to his diligent study and hard practice. Why was he able to achieve such great success? On the one hand, it was because he was not afraid of difficulties and persisted in learning; on the other hand, it was also because he was able to "learn step by step from the simple to the profound." Based on the actual needs of his work, he developed a study plan, and successively completed the algebra, chemistry, and physics of junior high school, the mathematics and chemistry of senior high school, as well as calculus, chemical engineering principles, and other basic subjects that a chemical worker should learn. From Comrade Xu Renwu's experience, we can see that what helped him "learn step by step from the simple to the profound" were still the ordinary textbooks used by students in school.
    Using ordinary textbooks for students in school for self-study is very difficult. However, since self-studying youth cannot find systematically organized introductory books in various subjects specifically written for them in bookstores, they naturally have to adopt the method of hard-chewing textbooks. The continuous expansion of the number of textbooks sold at Xinhua Bookstore can illustrate this fact.
    Textbooks distributed by Xinhua Bookstore have always been centrally ordered by various schools. Because retail quantities could not be controlled, Xinhua Bookstore used to limit the retail of textbooks in its stores as much as possible. Later, in order to take care of the needs of young people's spare-time study, retail sales were expanded starting in 1955. At that time, the internally stipulated ratio was: retail sales should account for 3% of the total number of copies, but this ratio actually fell far short of meeting the needs of readers. By the spring of 1956, the supply of middle school textbooks by the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore showed an astonishing figure, namely, about 350,000 copies were supplied for students in school, and about 500,000 copies were supplied for on-the-job youth for spare-time study. It is estimated that this autumn, the supply of middle school textbooks for on-the-job youth for spare-time study may exceed 1 million copies. From this, it can be seen that in today's call for young people to advance towards science, the inability to find some appropriate self-study books introducing basic knowledge of various subjects in bookstores is indeed a serious problem.
    From the reader letters to the China Youth Publishing House, it can be seen even more that on-the-job youth are eager to publish a set of self-study textbooks from junior high school to senior high school. One reader said: "Many young people, like me, are unfamiliar with natural science and are very distressed. They request that the publishing department or your agency publish some natural science textbooks such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry for junior high school and senior high school levels, and that they be written in an easy-to-understand manner like teachers in schools explaining to students in the classroom." This can very well represent the wishes of most on-the-job self-studying youth. This wish should be satisfied.
    To satisfy this wish of the vast number of self-studying youth is certainly not a simple matter. First of all, self-study textbooks, like school textbooks, have many subjects, and under the readers' earnest expectations, the publication time cannot be delayed for too long. Now, all publishing houses are divided according to their professional divisions of labor. The most suitable for undertaking this task is the People's Education Publishing House, but the People's Education Publishing House's original work of editing and revising school textbooks is already very heavy. It goes without saying that it would be very difficult to produce another set of self-study textbooks in the short term.
    Secondly, the nature of self-study textbooks is different from that of school textbooks. How exactly they should be compiled is something that no one has experience with. It would also be difficult to compile a satisfactory set of self-study textbooks in the short term.
    However, these difficulties can be overcome. If it is said that there are many subjects in self-study textbooks and one publishing house cannot do it all at once, then priority books can be published first, and several publishing houses can cooperate and complete them within a time limit. If we affirm that self-study textbooks in natural science are most urgently needed, we can first compile books for the three subjects of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. For example, the People's Education Publishing House and the China Youth Publishing House can compile books for junior high school, and the Science Press and the Higher Education Press can compile books for senior high school. I think that as long as we slightly reduce the tasks of these publishing houses in other aspects, they have the conditions to undertake this work.
    As for how these textbooks should be compiled, it is certainly a question worth considering, but it is not a difficult problem to solve. First of all, we already have teaching syllabuses for various subjects, and we already have official school textbooks. Many teaching experiences on current school textbooks have also been published in various bulletins. All these materials are very good bases for compiling self-study textbooks. In terms of format, either add guiding "tips," "supplementary explanations," "explanations," "example problems," "bibliographies," etc. to the original text of the official textbook, or compile separately according to the teaching syllabus (regarding this aspect, we can absorb more Japanese experience), both can be considered. However, in order to shorten the publication date, I believe that the former compilation method, although not ideal, is more practical and feasible and is worth adopting. We should affirm that early publication is better than late publication, and having something is better than having nothing.
    Who will write these books? Most publishing houses feel that they lack editors. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that the publishing houses will write them themselves. However, in the teaching and research groups of various normal colleges and various middle schools, there are many experienced teachers. They are in contact with students every day. They know what is most difficult for students to understand in learning and what they need the most help with. They are the most reliable force for compiling this set of textbooks.
    In order to support on-the-job youth in advancing towards science, it is hoped that the cultural and educational leading departments will attach importance to this issue, seize the time while various publishing houses are about to formulate their next year's selection plans, immediately mobilize and organize relevant publishing houses to cooperate and jointly undertake the task of publishing self-study textbooks for various subjects, and give strong support to various publishing houses. At the same time, it is also hoped that educators with rich teaching experience can bravely come forward to write this type of manuscript and help various publishing houses complete this task well.

    支援在职青年向科学进军
    顾均正
    为了支援在职青年向科学进军，给他们编写一套自学用的各科入门书是必要的。
    现在的在职青年，除了少数是高等学校的毕业生以外，绝大部分是从初中到高中一二年级程度的青年。这些青年向科学进军，当然不是要搞学术研究，也不是要考副博士，而是要配合本人工作的需要，提高文化业务水平，学习基础科学知识，为更好地发挥个人力量创造 前提。由于他们各有工作，学习必须在业余进行，就学习的条件来说，他们是跟在学青年不同的。他们虽然有向科学进军的愿望，却缺少引路的人；他们虽然知道学习科学要循序渐进，却找不到适当的由浅入深的各科入门书。
    书店里固然有不少适合于初高中程度的各种通俗科学读物，可是这些书大都只能供阅读浏览，而不是给他们作钻研进修用的。
    现在单就各种通俗的自然科学读物来说，它们大致可以分为这样的两种类型：
    一类是介绍科学上的伟大成就的，像伊林的大部分著作。这类书向读者说明人类怎样利用科学来改造世界，同时还指出建筑在高度技术基础上的共产主义社会的美丽远景。它们的作用主要在宣传人类掌握科学技术以后的巨大力量，以具体生动的事实来号召读者向科学进军。这类书可以给自学青年一种鼓舞，却不能满足他们进一步的要求——怎样去找到进军的道路。
    还有一类是配合学校课本用的补充读物。有的以生动的语言、丰富的事例和恰当的比喻，把科学上的某些问题作了详尽、浅显的解释，像伊林的“原子世界旅行记”，别尔曼的“摆线”，雅库平科的“消化的故事”，高尔松斯卡娅的“果实种子历险记”等。有的就日常生活中的某些现象设为有趣的问题，引导读者去用心思想，并帮助读者用简单的科学原理来解决这些问题，像别莱利曼的大部分著作和盖尔的“物理世界的漫游”等。这类书是以读者原有的科学知识做基础的。它们的作用主要在巩固这些知识，运用这些知识。不过它们虽然引导着读者在他们原有的知识领域内作各种各样的短期旅行，让读者尽量欣赏沿途的名胜古迹，却并没有引导读者跨过这个界限，在进军的道路上逐步深入，去攀登科学的峰顶。
    当然这并不是说，这些通俗科学读物对于自学青年毫无帮助，恰恰相反，它们在向科学进军的道路上，是青年们最好的伴侣。青年在开始学习科学的时候，正应该多看一些通俗的补充读物，多听一些通俗的演讲；但是既然要向科学进军，就决不能单靠这种不很花气力的学习，老是在原有的知识基础上兜圈子。学科学不但要重视“循序”，还要努力“前进”；不但要经常“温故”，还要不断“知新”。我们看了山东化工厂徐人武同志的苦学经验，就可以明白这个道理。
    徐人武同志告诉我们，他在开始自学的时候，仅仅是一个“具有高小的文化程度，还缺乏起码的科学知识”的勤杂工，可是在短短的六年（1946年到1952年）中，靠了他的勤学苦练，已经成为一个具有专业知识、能够独立工作的国家建设人才了。他为什么能够有这样巨大的成就呢？一方面固然由于他不怕困难，坚持学习；另一方面也由于他能够“一步步地由浅入深地学习”。他根据工作的实际需要，订定学习计划，把初中的代数、化学、物理，高中的数学、化学以及微积分、化工原理等——作为一个化学工作者所应该学习的几门基本功课依次学完了。从徐人武同志的经验，我们可以看到，帮助他“一步步地由浅入深地学习着”的还是在校学生用的普通课本。
    拿在校学生用的普通课本来自学，困难是很多的。但是自学青年在书店里既然找不到特地为他们编写的有系统的由浅入深的各科入门书，自然就不得不采取硬啃课本这个办法。新华书店零售课本数字的不断扩大，就可以说明这个事实。
    新华书店发行的课本，一向都是由各学校集中订购的。由于零售数量无法掌握，过去新华书店尽量限制在门市部零售课本。后来为了照顾青年业余学习的需要，才从1955年起开始扩大零售。当时内部规定的比数是：零售数为总册数的3％，可是这个比数实际上远远不能满足读者的需要。到了1956年春季，新华书店北京分店供应的中学课本，出现了一个惊人的数字，即供应在校学生用的约为35万册，供应在职青年业余学习用的约为50万册。估计今年秋季供应在职青年业余学习用的中学课本，可能超出100万册。由此可见，在号召青年向科学进军的今天，竟不能在书店里找到一些适当的介绍各科基础知识的自学用书，确是一个严重的问题。
    从中国青年出版社的读者来信中，更可以看到，在职青年渴望出版一套从初中到高中的自学课本的要求。有一位读者说：“有许多青年和我一样，对自然科学不摸底，非常苦恼，要求出版部门或你社出版一些初中和高中程度的数理化等自然科学课本，要写得像学校中的老师在课堂上跟学生讲解一样易懂。”这很可以代表大多数在职的自学青年的愿望。这一愿望是应该给予满足的。
    要满足广大自学青年的这一愿望，当然不是一件简单的事情。首先，自学课本跟学校课本一样，科目很多，而在读者殷切的期望之下，出版时间又不能拖得太长。现在各出版社都按专业分工，最适宜于担负这一任务的只有人民教育出版社，可是人民教育出版社原有的编辑和修订学校课本的工作已很繁重，要在短期内再搞一套自学课本，不用说是有很大的困难。
    其次，自学课本的性质跟学校课本不同，究竟应该怎样编写，大家都没有经验，要在短期内编出一套满意的自学课本，也是有困难的。
    不过，这些困难是可以克服的。如果说，自学课本的科目多，一个出版社一下子搞不起来，那就可以先出重点书，由几个出版社分工合作，限期完成。我们如果肯定自然科学的自学课本需要最迫切，就可以先编写数学、物理、化学三门功课的用书，譬如说由人民教育出版社和中国青年出版社编初中用书，由科学出版社和高等教育出版社编高中用书。我想，只要稍稍减轻这些出版社其他方面的任务，这个工作，它们是有条件担负起来的。
    至于这类课本应该怎样编写，当然是一个值得考虑的问题，但并不是一个难解决的问题。首先我们已经有了各科教学大纲，已经有了正式的学校用课本。在各种通报上还发表了许多关于现行学校课本的教学经验。所有这些材料，都是编写自学课本的很好的依据。在体例方面，或者根据正式课本的原文另加辅导性的“提示”、“补充说明”、“解释”、“例题”、“参考书目”等，或者根据教学大纲另行编写（关于这方面，可以多多吸收日本的经验），都可考虑。但是为了缩短出书日期起见，我认为前一个编写方法虽非理想，却比较切实易行，值得采取。我们应该肯定早出版比迟出版好，有比没有好。
    谁来编写这些书呢？各出版社大都感到缺少编辑干部，由出版社自编，照目前情形看来，它的可能性很少。然而在各个师范学院、各个中等学校的教研组中，却有着不少有经验的老师，他们天天跟学生接触，他们知道学生在学习中最难理解的是什么，最需要帮助的是什么，他们是编写这一套课本的最可依靠的力量。
    为了支援在职青年向科学进军，希望文化教育领导部门重视这个问题，趁各出版社将要拟订明年度的选题计划的时候，立即抓紧时间，动员并且组织有关出版社分工合作，共同来担负起出版各科自学课本的任务，并给各出版社以大力支持。同时也希望富有教学经验的教育工作者们，能够当仁不让地来编写这一类书稿，帮助各出版社很好地完成这一任务。
