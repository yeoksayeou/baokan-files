Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 18th: The world-renowned peace activist, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, along with his wife and two daughters, arrived in Urumqi by plane from Alma-Ata, Soviet Union, on the 17th. More than 20 people, including Nusreti, Secretary-General of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, welcomed them at the airport.

This is Johnson's third visit to China. In 1932, he represented the British Relief Association to provide disaster relief in the Yangtze River area. He revisited China in 1952 and wrote an article titled "My Appeal" after returning home, exposing the crimes of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare. At the same time, he also wrote a book titled "China's New Creative Era," vividly depicting the sharp contrast between the old and new China, which attracted the attention of the people of Western Europe.

    英坎特伯雷教长约翰逊到达乌鲁木齐
    据新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　世界著名的和平人士英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊和他的夫人及其两个女儿，十七日由苏联阿拉木图乘飞机到达乌鲁木齐。到机场欢迎的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会新疆维吾尔自治区分会秘书长努斯热提等二十多人。
    约翰逊这次来我国参观访问已经是第三次了。他在1932年，曾代表英国救济会来我国赈济长江一带水灾。1952年他重来我国访问，回国后写了“我的呼吁”一文，揭露了美国帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行；同时他还写了“中国的新创造时代”一书，生动地描绘出新旧中国两个鲜明的对照，引起了西欧人民的注意。
