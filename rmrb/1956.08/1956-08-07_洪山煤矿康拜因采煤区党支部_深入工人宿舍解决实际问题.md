Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, August 4th. The Communist Party branch of the "Combine" coal mining area of Zibo Hongshan Coal Mine is a Communist Party branch that can closely connect with the masses and care about the well-being of the workers. The branch secretary and members of this branch often use their spare time to go to the miners' dormitories to talk with the workers, deeply understand the situation, and promptly solve the workers' difficulties in production and life.

This mining area has more than one hundred miners, with a full-time branch secretary doing political work. In the past, the branch only educated workers by holding large meetings and rarely understood the workers' real thoughts. In April of this year, the Party branch committee studied this situation and decided that the Party branch should go deep into the masses to carry out work and change the practice of simply holding large meetings. The branch committee also requested that the full-time branch secretary, Chen Faming, frequently visit the workers' dormitories, and other part-time branch members should also use their time off work to conduct visits. Since then, the branch secretary and branch members have often gone to the dormitories to chat with the workers during the rest time of the three shifts. So far, the branch secretary alone has visited eighty workers' families and single workers. Through these visits, the branch has learned a lot about the workers' real thoughts and demands, and has promptly solved problems among the workers. For example, Wang Xiangli's group, which had consistently lagged behind in production, used to remain silent during meetings, and the branch did not understand the reasons for the group's backwardness. After going deep into the dormitory and chatting with Zhang Tizong, a worker in this group, it was learned that the group leader only cared about exceeding his own quota and did not care about the production of others, which led to disunity. After the branch criticized and educated the group leader, the production situation of this group has significantly changed, and the workers often exceed their quotas, and the group's wage income has increased by more than 30% compared to before. Xu Rutian, a member of the Communist Youth League, used to be very active in production, but suddenly became inactive in March of this year. He also did not speak at meetings and said that he wanted to go home to participate in the agricultural production cooperative. The branch secretary and branch members learned from talking with other workers that a girl in the agricultural cooperative had fallen in love with him, so he was reluctant to go down the well to produce. After the Party branch educated him on the correct view of love, Xu Rutian became active again.

Sometimes the branch secretary and branch members also talk with the workers' family members, hoping that they will manage the housework well, cook good meals, and take good care of the children, so that the workers can eat well, sleep well, and live happily. At the same time, the branch also mobilized more than thirty Communist Party members in the whole area to talk with the workers during production gaps.

Due to the change in the work style of the Party branch and the strengthening of political work, more than half of the so-called "backward" workers have become advanced producers, and the team of advanced producers in the whole area has expanded by more than 25%.

    洪山煤矿康拜因采煤区党支部
    深入工人宿舍解决实际问题
    新华社淄博4日电　淄博洪山煤矿“康拜因”采煤区中共支部是一个能够密切联系群众、关心工人疾苦的共产党支部。这个支部的支部书记和委员们，经常利用业余时间到矿工宿舍和工人谈心，深入了解情况，及时解决了工人生产上和生活上的困难问题。
    这个采煤区共有一百多名矿工，有一个专职支部书记作政治工作。过去，支部只用开大会的方式对工人进行教育，很少深入了解工人的真实思想情况。今年四月，党支部委员会研究了这种情况，决定党支部应该深入群众进行工作，转变单纯开大会的作法，支部委员会还要求由专职支部书记陈发明经常深入到工人宿舍中去进行访问，其他兼职的支部委员们也要利用工休时间进行访问。这以后，支部书记和支部委员就利用三班工人回家休息的时间，常常到宿舍去找工人谈天。到目前为止，仅支部书记一人就已经访问了八十个工人家庭和单身工人。通过这种访问，使支部了解了很多工人的真实思想情况和要求，并及时解决了工人中的问题。如生产一贯落后的王相礼小组，过去开大会时组员都不发言，支部也不了解这个小组落后的原因在那里；经过深入宿舍和这个组的工人张体宗漫谈后，才知道是因为组长只管自己突破定额而不管别人的生产，弄得大家不团结。支部对组长进行批评教育后，这个小组的生产情况有了显著转变，工人都经常突破定额，全组的工资收入比以前增加了30％以上。青年团员许如田过去生产一向很积极，今年三月忽然不积极了，开会也不说话，并说要回家参加农业生产合作社。支部书记和支部委员们从和别的工人谈话中，了解到原来是农业社里的姑娘爱上了他，他因此不愿再下井生产。党支部向他进行了正确的恋爱观点的教育后，许如田又积极起来了。
    有时支部书记和支部委员们还和工人家属谈心，希望她们好好管理家务，把饭做好，把孩子带好，使工人吃得好，睡得好，生活得愉快。在这同时，支部还发动全区三十多名共产党员利用生产空隙时间和工人谈心。
    由于党支部工作作风的转变，由于政治工作的加强，过去所谓“落后”的工人就有半数以上成了先进生产者，全区的先进生产者队伍扩大了25％以上。
