    Sino-Czech Women's Basketball Friendly Match
    Chinese Team Wins by One Point
    On the evening of the 16th, the joint team composed of the "August 1st" Women's Basketball Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Women's Basketball Team of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education defeated the Czechoslovak National Women's Basketball Team with a score of 54 to 53.
    Because both sides were facing strong opponents, they both fielded their main players in this game. Shortly after the opening, the joint team tried its best to surround the Czech team's center, Da. Hubalkova, which caused a neglect in the perimeter defense. The Czech team scored the first point with a mid-range shot. After that, the two sides fought fiercely. In the first quarter, the score was tied four times at 2-2, 6-6, 8-8, and 10-10. Finally, the Czech team led with 12-11, ending the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter, the joint team made a free throw, tying the score again at 12-12. After that, the Czech team's center, Da. Hubalkova, was very active under the basket, either leaping up to score or passing the ball to other players who cut in, scoring continuously and creating a 21-13 advantage. At this time, the joint team requested a timeout. After discussing countermeasures, they tried their best to counterattack and repeatedly cut into the basket, which proved effective, and the score gradually narrowed. However, the Czech team's offensive was still very fierce. No. 3, Mi. Vitskova, lively and vigorously cut into the basket to shoot, or coordinated with the center to receive the ball, constantly scoring. The joint team stepped up guarding the Czech team's key center. Due to the joint team's fierce cuts, the Czech team committed fouls repeatedly; in order to preserve their main players, the Czech team replaced two main players in preparation for the final battle. At the end of the first half, the Czech team led with 30-23.
    At the beginning of the second half, only two main players of the Czech team were on the court, and their mobility was weakened, so they changed their tactics: No. 13, Ha. Yelozova, who had a relatively accurate shot, took mid-range shots from the perimeter. If the shot missed, the tall No. 11 center, Yi. Stepanova, would grab the ball and leap up to score. This tactic was very successful, creating a 35-25 lead. The joint team also saw that the Czech team's replacement, No. 11 center, was not as good as No. 9 in defense, so they focused on breaking through her, and tied the score again at 37-37. At this critical moment, the Czech team again sent the main center No. 9 back onto the court. With only seven minutes left in the game, the Czech team switched to a ball-control tactic. This tactic once caused the joint team to become impatient. But they quickly corrected this. The joint team continued to fight steadily, and scored continuously with cuts and mid-range shots, turning the tide. Finally, the joint team won the game with a score of 54-53. (Zhou Zuxi)

    中捷女子篮球友谊赛
    中国队领先一分得胜
    十六日晚，中国人民解放军“八一”女子篮球队和北京体育学院女子篮球队组成的联队在同捷克斯洛伐克国家女子篮球队的比赛中，以五十四比五十三得胜。
    这场比赛因为双方都面临强敌，所以都以主力队员上场。开球不久，由于联队极力包围捷队的中锋达·胡巴尔科娃，造成外围防守疏忽，捷队以中距离命中，首开记录。此后，双方争夺得极为厉害，在第一节里以二比二，六比六，八比八，十比十，四次打平。最后，捷队以十二比十一领先，结束了第一节。第二节开始，联队罚进一球，又打成十二平。其后，捷队的中锋达·胡巴尔科娃在篮下非常活跃，自己跃起上篮，或者传球给别的队员切进，连连得分，造成二十一比十三的优势局面。这时联队要求暂停，商量对策以后，极力反攻，连连切入篮下，果真见效，比分逐渐拉近。但捷队攻势仍很猛，三号米·维茨科娃生龙活虎地切进篮下投球，或者策应中锋接球，不断得分。联队加紧看守捷队的灵魂中锋。由于联队的猛烈切进，捷队屡次犯规；为了保存主力，捷队换下了两个主力队员，准备最后的鏖战。上半时完了捷队以三十比二十三领先。
    下半场开始，捷队只有两个主力在场，活动能力削弱了，于是改变了打法：以投篮比较准确的十三号哈·叶罗兹娃在外围投中距离，投不中则由篮下高大的十一号中锋依·斯捷潘诺娃抢球跃起上篮。这个战术运用得很成功，造成三十五比二十五的领先局面。联队也看准了捷队换上的十一号中锋的防守能力不及九号，便重点突破她，又以三十七比三十七再次打平。在这紧要关头，捷队又调主力中锋九号上场。在离终场只有七分钟的时候，捷队改用了控制球的战术。这个战术曾造成联队一度的急躁。但很快就纠正了。联队继续稳扎稳打，切进和中距离投篮不断得分，又把败局扳了过来。最后，联队以五十四比五十三赢得了这场比赛。（周祖羲）
