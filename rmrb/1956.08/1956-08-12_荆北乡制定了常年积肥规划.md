Jingbei Township Formulates Long-Term Manure Accumulation Plan

    Jingbei Township in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, has recently formulated a long-term manure accumulation plan. This plan clearly stipulates the amount of fertilizer needed for each season and throughout the year, from planting late rice and winter sowing this year to spring sowing, rice transplanting, and mid-term topdressing next year, as well as the sources of fertilizer and how to strengthen leadership in manure accumulation work.
    The Jiangling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has promoted the experience of Jingbei Township throughout the county, considering it a good method to correct the current relaxation of leadership and laissez-faire attitude towards rural manure accumulation work in various localities. It requires all localities to conduct a comprehensive plan for rural manure accumulation in conjunction with the current winter sowing preparations, to overcome the long-standing phenomenon of fertilizer shortage in all seasons.
    In the past, Jingbei Township, like other villages, failed to carry out long-term manure accumulation activities, and often suffered from a "fertilizer shortage" throughout the year. Township and commune leaders did not plan for fertilizer use and accumulation, and the masses were not informed. Only when the sowing and transplanting season arrived did they realize that fertilizer preparation was insufficient. They then hurriedly put aside other work and invested all their labor in a crash manure accumulation campaign. Often, the manure accumulated through the campaign could not meet production needs, and in the end, some fields had to be planted without base fertilizer. This year, the more than 700 mu of early rice in Jingbei Township that was transplanted without base fertilizer was later top-dressed with more than 10,000 jin of oilseed cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, but the harvest was still not as good as the early rice that had been applied with base fertilizer.
    In order to overcome this phenomenon, Jingbei Township formulated a long-term manure accumulation plan. The method of formulation was: first, based on the planting area of various crops specified in the township's agricultural production plan and the proposed yield increase targets, calculate the fertilizer needs for each crop, each production season, and the whole year; then, arrange the fertilizers according to crop and production season, mobilize the masses to tap potential and find fertilizer sources, and calculate the amount of fertilizer that can be accumulated from each fertilizer source in each season and the whole year; then, calculate the total account to see if it can meet the needs of increasing production; and finally, determine the plan and accumulate fertilizer according to the plan.
    The fertilizer needed for planting late rice in Jingbei Township this year will be solved based on this fertilizer plan. Before the plan was formulated, many cadres complained that there was not enough fertilizer for late rice and requested the state to supply a large amount of commercial fertilizer. Later, after the fertilizer plan was formulated, the masses were mobilized, and many new fertilizer sources were found. Three kinds of quick composting methods were promoted, and a reasonable price was set to purchase commune members' household manure. In half a month, the township accumulated more than 800,000 dan of natural fertilizer. Not only was commercial fertilizer not needed, but many agricultural cooperatives had surplus fertilizer after transplanting late rice seedlings. The fertilizer needed for winter sowing and spring sowing next year has also been secured through this plan. In this way, the phenomenon of fertilizer shortage throughout the year can no longer occur.
    In order to ensure the implementation of this plan, the Jingbei Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and various agricultural cooperatives have adopted the following measures:
    1. Establish a special person responsibility system, and regard manure accumulation work as a regular and important task for township and commune leaders in production. The township branch decided to assign a deputy secretary to take charge of specific leadership, regularly supervise and inspect, each agricultural cooperative assigned a deputy director to manage it, and the production team was jointly responsible by the captain and the manure accumulation professional team (group) cadres.
    2. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of commune members in accumulating manure and carry out mass-based long-term manure accumulation activities, it was decided to regularly purchase commune members' household manure, set a reasonable price, evaluate based on quality, give preferential prices for high-quality products, and try to achieve cash transactions to increase the daily income of commune members. The cooperative appropriately arranges labor for collective manure accumulation and reasonably records work points. Appropriate quotas are set for manure accumulation by feeders. Manure within the quota is reasonably recorded for work points, and manure outside the quota is purchased at the price of commune members' personal manure accumulation, to reward feeders for diligently accumulating manure and accumulating more manure.
    3. Allocate manure accumulation tasks level by level according to the plan. The township allocates manure accumulation tasks to the commune and the commune to the production team, basically according to the fertilizer required by each unit to complete the production plan, requiring each commune and production team to make specific manure accumulation plans and arrange labor. It is also planned to allocate certain tasks to commune members by person or by household with the consent of the commune members, and they will make their own manure accumulation plans.
    When allocating manure accumulation tasks, the township also proposed a four-fixed method of fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed remuneration, and regularly conducted education on "accumulating manure and loving the commune, increasing production and achieving bumper harvests" for cadres and commune members, and launched a long-term manure accumulation competition between communes and communes, teams and teams, and commune members.

### 荆北乡制定了常年积肥规划

    荆北乡制定了常年积肥规划
    湖北省江陵县荆北乡最近制定了常年积肥规划。从今年栽植晚稻、冬季播种，一直到明年春播、插秧和中期追肥，每季和全年需要多少肥料，肥料从哪里来，如何加强积肥工作的领导等，在这个规划中都有明确的规定。
    中共江陵县委员会已向全县推广了荆北乡的经验，认为这是纠正目前各地对农村积肥工作放松领导，放任自流的好办法，要求各地结合当前的冬播准备工作，对农村积肥作一次全面规划，以克服长期以来四季缺肥的现象。
    过去，荆北乡也和其他乡村一样，常年积肥活动搞不起来，一年四季常闹“肥料荒”。乡和社的领导平时对于用肥、积肥没有计划，群众也不摸底，临到播种、插秧的时节，才发现肥料准备不足，于是匆匆忙忙放下其他工作，把全部劳动力投入积肥突击运动。往往经过突击积的肥还不能满足生产需要，最后只得在部分田里不施底肥。今年，荆北乡“白水插秧”的七百多亩早稻，后来虽然追施了一万多斤饼肥和化学肥料，收成仍然不如施过底肥的早稻好。
    为了克服这种现象，荆北乡制定了常年积肥规划。制定的办法是：首先根据全乡农业生产规划中规定的各种作物播种面积和提出来的增产指标，算出每种作物、每个生产季节和全年的肥料需要账；接着按作物和生产季节进行肥料排队，发动群众挖潜力找肥源，计算每项肥源在每季和全年能够积出多少肥料；然后再算总账，看看能不能满足增产的需要；最后确定计划，按计划积肥。
    荆北乡今年种植晚稻需要的肥料，就是根据这次制定肥料规划来解决的。规划制定前，许多干部都喊晚稻肥料不够，要求国家供应大量商品肥料，后来制定积肥规划，群众被发动起来了，找到了许多新的肥源，推广了三种速成堆肥法，并且订出合理价格来收购社员的家肥，在半个月内全乡就积了八十多万担自然肥料，不仅商品肥料不要了，许多农业社在插过晚稻秧以后还有多余的肥料。全乡今年冬播和明年春播等所需用的肥料，通过这次规划，也都找到了着落。这样，一年四季缺肥的现象就可以不再发生了。
    为了保证实现这个规划，中共荆北乡支部和各农业社采取了以下几项措施：
    一、建立专人负责制，把积肥工作当作乡、社领导生产的一项经常的重要的任务。乡支部决定派一个副书记具体领导，经常督促检查，各个农业社各派一个副主任专管，生产队由队长和积肥专业队（组）干部共同负责。
    二、为了发挥社员的积肥积极性，开展群众性的常年积肥活动，决定定期收购社员的家肥，定价合理，论质评价，优质优价，并且尽力做到现钱交易增加社员的日常收入。合作社适当安排劳动力进行集体积肥，合理记工。对饲养员积肥规定出适当的限额，在限额以内的肥料合理记工，限额以外的肥料按社员个人积肥办法付价收购，奖励饲养员勤积肥、多积肥。
    三、按照规划逐级分配积肥任务。乡对社、社对生产队，基本上按各单位完成生产计划所需的肥料分配积肥任务，要求各社和生产队都作出具体的积肥计划，安排好劳力。对社员也准备按人或按户征得社员同意后分配给一定任务，由本人作出积肥计划。
    这个乡在分配积肥任务的时候，还提出了定数量、定质量、定时间、定报酬的四定办法，并且对干部和社员经常进行“积肥爱社，增产丰收”的教育，展开社与社、队与队和社员之间常年的积肥竞赛。
