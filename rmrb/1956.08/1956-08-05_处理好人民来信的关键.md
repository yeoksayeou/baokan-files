    The Key to Properly Handling People's Letters
    Zhenhua Yukun
    Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, has done a relatively good job in handling letters and visits from the people, and has gained some important experiences.

     Over 13,000 Letters and Visits Handled in Three Years
    Gaoping County's work on handling letters and visits from the people has been gradually developing since 1953. In the past three years, the county has handled more than 13,000 letters and visits from the people. By handling these letters, it has not only educated cadres to improve their leadership style and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, but also enhanced the masses' political consciousness and sense of responsibility as masters of the country, opening up broad avenues for promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. As a result, the number of people's letters has gradually increased, the issues reflected have become more extensive, and the role of the letters has become increasingly significant. Many difficult problems have been resolved after being reflected in the people's letters. For example, the counter-revolutionary element Chang Ziqing, who had blood debts and had been in hiding for more than ten years, was finally arrested and brought to justice after being reported by the masses in letters. The Party Branch Secretary of Shimu Village, Zhou Dongfa, and others concealed more than 500 mu of land, paid less in levies, and even fraudulently obtained the title of model village for high yield. For five years, many county and district cadres stationed in the village had failed to discover this, but it was revealed by the masses in letters. People's letters not only exposed bad people, bad deeds, mistakes, and shortcomings, but also put forward some beneficial suggestions. For example, the intercropping method of Chinese yam and maize and the method of planting cabbage after harvesting Chinese yam, proposed by the masses in Wang Village, have been preliminarily promoted on 5,872 mu throughout the county, and the estimated increase in production value is equivalent to more than 14 million jin of grain.

    Educating and Inspiring Cadres to Recognize the Importance of People's Letters
    The reason why the number of letters and visits from the people in Gaoping County has been increasing year by year, and the role they play has become more and more important, is mainly because the county Party committee attaches importance to it and strengthens specific leadership over the work of handling letters and visits from the people. Since last year, the CPC Gaoping County Committee has collectively studied the work of handling letters and visits from the people at least once every quarter, and has taken various measures to strengthen this work.
    When Gaoping County first started handling people's letters, many cadres did not understand the significance of this work, and therefore did not pay much attention to it. For example, Wang Lifa of Jia Village once went to several county-level organs to report the problem of village cadres engaging in favoritism and protecting relatives in the grain supply, but these organs did not pay attention to it. Later, after Comrade Chang Sanmao, the secretary of the county Party committee, personally received him, he sent people to conduct an in-depth investigation, and the results proved that the situation he reported was basically true. The county Party committee not only corrected the malpractices in the grain supply work in Jia Village, but also used this example to educate cadres and inspire them to recognize the importance of handling people's letters. In recent years, the county Party committee has personally guided the handling of major cases. According to statistics, the county Party committee directly participated in the handling of 32 cases in 1955 alone. Under the influence of the county Party committee's example, leading comrades of various organs have also gradually attached importance to and strengthened the work of handling letters and visits from the people.
    Since last year, the county Party committee has conducted a summary and evaluation of the work of handling letters and visits from the people in county-level directly affiliated organs every quarter, and commended units that handled letters and visits from the people well and criticized those that did poorly. This practice has greatly promoted the work of handling letters and visits from the people in various county-level units.
       Encourage Reporting, Oppose False Accusations
    The county Party committee uses various methods to encourage the masses to fight against bad people, bad deeds, mistakes, and shortcomings; the county Party committee also gives appropriate criticism or blows to those who make false accusations out of spite. For example, after Zhu Xinshuo of Chen Village reported the embezzlement of Dong Jinxian, the accountant of the agricultural production cooperative, and it was verified to be true and he was arrested and brought to justice, the county Party committee publicly commended Zhu Xinshuo at the county cooperative cadre meeting. Chang Hong, a farmer in Changzhuang Village, received a reward in kind for reporting counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, the county Party committee gave Party disciplinary action to Zhao Ruilin, a Party member of Yechuan Township, who anonymously falsely accused the Party branch secretary of seeking a leading position, and notified the whole county.
    In this way, it not only educated the cadres and strengthened the work of handling letters and visits from the people in county-level organs, but also inspired the political consciousness of the masses. For example, after Zhu Xinshuo was commended, the problem of embezzlement by cadres of agricultural cooperatives in Kouze and other villages was also exposed by the masses.
       Publicly Handle Typical Cases
    Secondly, the county Party committee not only attaches importance to strengthening the work of handling letters and visits from the people, but also is good at cooperating with the central work to publicly handle some typical cases exposed by the masses, in order to promote the general situation. For example, last year, in the work of rectifying the grain supply, after discovering the incident of Zhang Zhida, a Party member in Tangzhuang Village, colluding with bad elements to sabotage the grain supply work, Zhang was expelled from the Party, arrested and brought to justice, and notified the whole county, and organized all branches to study. As a result, it was very effective. A total of 80,000 jin of grain that had been fraudulently claimed or saved were voluntarily returned by 31 handicraft cooperatives and 104 households in Zhangbi, Gutou, and other places alone. In 1955, in conjunction with agricultural cooperativization, conscription, and the division of townships, 135 typical cases were publicly handled throughout the county, which greatly promoted various central tasks.

    Draw Inferences from One Instance and Actively Solve Common Problems
    In the work of handling letters and visits from the people, the Gaoping County Party Committee also often pays attention to discovering policy-related or common problems from the letters, and solves them proactively as early as possible, avoiding the passive situation of solving problems after they have accumulated. For example, in April this year, after the county Party committee received letters from Ren Yewen and other people reflecting that although they were self-sufficient households, they were running out of food because the production quota set last year was too high and the amount retained was insufficient, they studied the situation of the whole county in the spirit of "drawing inferences from one instance," and sent cadres to go deep into Mayou, Gutou, and other townships to find out the real situation of grain-deficient households, and took the initiative to solve the problem, stabilizing the production mood of the masses and winning their support.

    Cooperate with Each Other to Handle Major and Complex Cases
    In the work of handling letters and visits from the people, Gaoping County also paid attention to using the method of mutual cooperation and joint operations to handle relatively major and complex cases. In 1955 alone, it organized more than two units to jointly handle 29 complex and major cases. In this way, the cases were not only handled quickly and in a timely manner, but also accurately. For example, in December last year, after the Gaoping County People's Court received an anonymous report from the masses that Cui Shuanghai, a reactionary rich peasant, had illegally purchased more than 2,400 jin of grain and evaded more than 800 yuan of national tax, although the reporter did not write down which village Cui was from, after joint research and handling by the Public Security Bureau, the Tax Bureau, and other relevant units, Cui Shuanghai's address and case were fully clarified and he was arrested according to law in a very short period of time.

    In order to encourage the masses to put forward opinions on various tasks, and to report and expose bad people and bad deeds and cadres' violations of laws and regulations, Gaoping County has set up many "opinion boxes." Because the relevant organs have also conducted serious research and serious handling of the letters received in the opinion boxes, they have been able to obtain feedback from the masses in almost all movements. In the spring of this year, when rectifying the cooperatives in Sanquan Township, 48 letters were taken out of the opinion box. These letters reflected the phenomena of corruption and degeneration of cooperative cadres, eating and drinking extravagantly, and wasting cooperative property, and the problems of accountant Wang Fengshan and others embezzling 360 yuan and more than 1,000 yuan being unaccounted for. This helped the rectification cadres to find the crux of the problem and quickly launched the rectification work. However, in handling anonymous letters of reflection in the opinion box, it is also necessary to be vigilant to avoid being exploited by bad elements.

    Although Gaoping County's work in handling letters and visits from the people has achieved some good experiences, there are still some problems, such as: some organs do not pay enough attention to the work of handling letters and visits from the people; some organs are equipped with relatively weak cadres; some units do not have complete registration and inaccurate statistics; some units have a chaotic filing system, and the handling of cases is unfinished, etc., which still need further efforts from Gaoping County to solve.

    认真处理人民来信究竟有什么好处？究竟用什么方法才能把人民来信处理得好？高平县的经验是值得参考的。
    处理好人民来信的关键
    振华　玉昆
    山西高平县处理人民群众来信来访工作是比较好的，也取得了一些重要经验。
     三年中来信来访一万三千多件
    高平县的处理人民来信来访工作，是从1953年以后逐步开展起来的。三年来，全县共处理了人民来信来访一万三千多件。通过处理这些信件，不但教育干部改进了领导作风，密切了党与群众的关系，而且提高了群众的政治觉悟和国家主人翁的责任感，为发扬群众的积极性和创造性开辟了广阔的道路。因而人民来信数量逐渐增多，反映的问题也更加广泛，来信所起的作用也越来越大。许多不易解决的问题，经过群众来信反映以后都得到了解决。如逃匿了十多年的有血债的反革命分子常子清，经过群众来信检举后终于逮捕法办了。石木村以党支部书记周东发为首隐瞒了五百多亩土地，少出了负担，还骗取了丰产模范村的称号，五年来，许多县区干部驻在村里都没有发现，还是由群众来信揭发的。人民来信不但检举揭发了一些坏人、坏事、错误和缺点，而且也提出了一些有益的建议。如王村群众提出的山药玉茭间作和收了山药再种白菜的增产办法，已经在全县范围内初步推广了5，872亩，预计增产价值可相当于1，400多万斤粮食。
    教育和启发干部认识人民来信的重要
    高平县的人民来信来访之所以能够年年增加，而且所起作用也越来越大，主要是由于县委重视，对处理人民来信来访工作加强具体领导。中共高平县委从去年以来，每一季度至少要集体研究一次处理人民来信来访的工作，并且采取各种办法来加强这一工作。
    高平县刚刚开展处理人民来信工作的时候，很多干部不了解这个工作的意义，因而不大重视这个工作。比如当时贾村王礼法为反映村干部在粮食供应中徇情包庇的问题，曾经到过好几个县级机关，都没有引起这些机关的重视，后来县委书记常三毛同志亲自接见以后，便派人深入调查，结果证明他反映的情况基本上属实。县委不但纠正了贾村粮食供应工作中的徇私舞弊现象，而且用这个例子对干部进行了教育，启发干部认识了处理人民来信的重要性。几年来，对于重大案件，县委都亲自指导处理。据统计，仅1955年县委直接参与处理的就有32件。在县委以身作则的影响下，各机关领导同志也逐渐重视和加强了处理人民来信来访工作。
    从去年以来，县委每一季度都要对县直属机关的处理人民来信来访工作，作一次总结评比，对人民来信来访处理得好的单位予以表扬，坏的批评。这种作法，对县级各单位处理人民来信来访工作起了很大的推动作用。
       鼓励检举，反对诬告
    县委利用各种办法鼓舞群众同坏人、坏事、错误和缺点作斗争；对于挟嫌诬告者，县委也给予适当的批评或打击。如陈村朱新锁揭发农业生产合作社会计董进先贪污，经查明属实逮捕法办后，县委就在全县合作社干部会上，当众表扬了朱新锁。常庄农民常红则因检举反革命有功，得到了实物奖励。同时，县委对匿名诬告党支书谋取领导职位的野川乡党员赵瑞林，查清情况后就给予党纪处分，并通报全县。
    这样，不但教育了干部，加强了县级各机关处理人民来信来访工作，而且启发了群众的政治觉悟。如表扬朱新锁以后，口则等村农业社干部贪污的问题，也被群众揭发出来。
       公开处理典型案件
    其次，县委不但重视加强处理人民来信来访工作，而且善于配合中心工作，公开处理群众所揭发的一些典型案件，借以推动一般。如去年在整顿粮食供应工作中，发现唐庄党员张直达勾结坏分子破坏粮食供应工作的事件以后，将张开除党籍，逮捕法办，并通报全县，组织各支部学习。结果，收效很大，仅张必、沟头等31个手工业合作社和104户居民，就自报退出冒领和节余的粮食八万多斤。1955年结合农业合作化、征兵、划乡等工作，全县公开处理了135件典型案件，大大推动了各项中心工作。
    举一反三，主动解决普遍性问题
    高平县委在处理人民来信来访工作中，还经常注意从来信中发现带有政策性或普遍性的问题，及早主动解决，避免了问题成堆再来解决的被动局面的出现。比如今年四月，县委接到任业文等群众反映他们虽是自给自足户，但因去年定产偏高，留量不足，现在断了口粮的来信以后，就以“举一反三”的精神，研究了全县情况，并派出干部深入马游、沟头等乡查明缺粮户的真实情况，主动作了解决，安定了群众的生产情绪，得到了群众的拥护。
    互相配合，处理重大而复杂的案件
    在处理人民来信来访工作中，高平县还注意运用了相互配合，协同作战的办法，来处理比较重大复杂的案件。仅仅去年一年，就组织了两个以上的单位联合处理了29件复杂大案。这样，不但案件处理得迅速及时，而且准确。如去年十二月，高平县人民法院接到群众匿名检举反动富农崔双孩套购粮食2400多斤、偷漏国税800元的来信后，虽然检举人没写出崔是那一村的人，但经过公安局、税务局等有关单位共同研究，联合处理，在很短的时间内就把崔双孩的住址和案情全部查明，依法逮捕。
    为了鼓励群众对各种工作提出意见，和检举揭发坏人坏事及干部违法乱纪的事情，高平全县设置了很多“意见箱”。由于有关机关对意见箱中收到的信件也进行了认真研究和严肃处理，因此，差不多在各种运动中都能够得到群众的反映材料。今年春天在三泉乡整顿合作社时，就从意见箱中取出了48件来信。这些来信反映了社干部堕落腐化大吃大喝浪费社内财产的现象，会计王风山等贪污360元，并有一千多元下落不明等问题。这一下就帮助整社干部找到了问题的症结所在，迅速开展了整社工作。但是，在处理意见箱中的匿名反映信的时候，也需要提高警惕，以免被坏分子钻了空子。
    高平县处理人民来信来访的工作，虽然取得了一些较好的经验，但也还存在着一些问题，比如：有的机关对人民来信来访工作还不够重视；有的机关配备的干部比较弱；有的单位登记不全，统计不精确；有的单位存档制度混乱，办案有头无尾等等，还需要高平县进一步努力解决。
