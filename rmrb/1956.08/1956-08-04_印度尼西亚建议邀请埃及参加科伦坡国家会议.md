    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 3rd: Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Kusumo Widado told reporters on August 2nd that Indonesia had suggested to the other Colombo Powers – India, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan – that Egypt be accepted into the five-nation group. This suggestion was made before the nationalization of the Suez Canal.
    Kusumo Widado said that Egypt's neutral policy, along with that of other Asian and African countries, "has begun to play an increasingly important role in general international politics, especially in the international politics of Asia and Africa."
    Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani had announced a few days earlier that his government had been in contact with the other Colombo Powers regarding the holding of another Colombo Powers conference.
    Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwito Kusumo Widado also said that the proposed Colombo Powers conference might be held earlier because of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company.
    Mrs. Pujobuntoro, Chairman of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said that it would be best to invite Egypt to the planned conference, as this would allow for further and broader clarification from the Egyptian side. She also said that holding a Colombo Powers conference soon is important for preparing the conditions for a second Asian-African conference.

    印度尼西亚建议邀请埃及参加科伦坡国家会议
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人库苏莫维达多八月二日对新闻记者说，印度尼西亚已经向其他科伦坡国家印度、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦建议接受埃及参加这个五国集团。这种建议在苏彝士运河国有化以前就已经提出了。
    库苏莫维达多说，埃及和亚非两洲其他国家所执行的中立政策，“已经开始在一般国际政治中特别是亚非两洲国际政治中发挥日益重要的作用”。
    印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼几天以前曾经宣布，他的政府已经同其他科伦坡国家就举行另一次科伦坡国家会议问题进行接触。
    外交部发言人苏维托·库苏莫维达多还说，拟议中的科伦坡国家会议未尝不可能由于埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有而较早地举行。
    印度尼西亚国会外交小组委员会主席普佐邦托罗夫人说，最好是邀请埃及参加计划中的这次会议，因为这样就可以从埃及方面获得进一步的、更加广泛的澄清。她又说，不久就举行科伦坡国家会议，对于为召开第二次亚非会议准备条件说来是很重要的。
