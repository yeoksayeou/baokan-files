Xinhua News Agency reporter Nan Tian:

	On the evening of this year's "May Day," at 11:00 PM, an explosion occurred two kilometers north of Shenzhen Railway Station. The explosion point was located on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway line, 141.23 kilometers from Guangzhou, shattering a steel rail and a sleeper. Near the explosion point, iron cans and iron fragments were found.

	Following the incident, border public security personnel conducted an on-site investigation and study; however, due to the darkness, the search of the surrounding area yielded no results. This raised a number of questions for the border public security personnel: Who was the bomber? Where did he get the explosives? How did he approach the railway? What route did he take to leave the scene? And where is the culprit now?

	After extensive investigations, border public security personnel finally discovered a valuable piece of information. This information was provided by a resident living near Shenzhen. According to this resident, he had encountered a long-lost fellow villager the day before "May Day." This fellow villager seemed to have just returned from somewhere, but he was not carrying any luggage, only a can that looked like "Ovaltine" powder.

	The investigation proved that the incident was related to the "fellow villager" encountered by the resident. This "fellow villager," named Liu Li, was a professional spy who had joined the Chiang gang's secret service organization in Hong Kong in 1953. He had infiltrated Shenzhen, Zhangmutou, and other places to gather military intelligence and engage in other espionage activities. In April 1955, he returned to Hong Kong. In April of this year, the Hong Kong Chiang gang's secret service agency received instructions from Taiwan headquarters to carry out sabotage against us on "May Day." The Taiwan secret service headquarters even sent an instructor surnamed Song to give Liu Li technical guidance on timed demolition and other techniques. After all this was settled, Liu Li sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong on the evening of April 29th. On the evening of May 1st, he followed the instructions of the secret service agency and placed a timed explosive, disguised as an "Ovaltine" can, next to the railway track. This cunning professional spy quickly fled back to Hong Kong after placing the explosives.

	The next day, the criminal Liu Li appeared at the Zuiqiong Restaurant in Hong Kong, where many secret agents were celebrating his "achievement." Liu not only received "praise" for being "brave and capable" but also received monetary rewards. However, some people were dissatisfied and said, "It's a pity that the Communists suffered too little loss this time!"

	Soon after, Liu received a new mission from the secret service agency and, carrying radio parts, infiltrated Shenzhen again.

	On the morning of May 31st, a "passenger" crossed the Luohu Bridge from Hong Kong to Shenzhen. After arriving in Shenzhen, he did everything he could to kill time, waiting for the night to fall. When the lights came on, he even bought a ticket to see a play at the theater. At 9:30 PM, when the play ended, he returned to the Xinxin Hotel, where he had already booked a room. This "passenger" was none other than the spy Liu Li, who had bombed the railway a month earlier.

	As Liu opened the door to his room, public security personnel suddenly appeared before him. He shuddered as if waking from a dream and said, "It's over!"

    一月之内，侦破落网
    新华社记者　南天
    今年“五一”节晚上十一时，深圳车站以北二公里的地方发生了爆炸事件。爆炸点的位置在广（州）深（圳）铁路线上距广州一四一点二三公里的地方，炸断了一根钢轨和一根枕木。在爆炸点附近，发现有铁罐铁片等物。
    这一事情发生后，边防公安人员曾到现场进行了勘查和研究；但当时天很黑，对四周的搜索并未获得什么结果。这就在边防公安人员面前提出了一大堆的问题：爆破的罪犯究竟是谁呢？他从那里运来炸药？从那里接近铁路？又经什么路线离开了现场？现在罪犯又到那里去了呢？
    经过多方面的侦察，边防公安人员终于找到了一件很有价值的情况。这一情况是住在深圳附近的一个居民提供的。据这位居民说，他曾在“五一”节的前一天，碰见了他的一位久不见面的同乡，这位同乡好像是刚从外边回来的，但没有携带任何行李，只是拿着一罐好像“阿华田”粉之类的罐头。
    侦察的结果证明，事情就发生在被那个居民碰见的“同乡”身上，他的这个“同乡”名叫刘立，是一个从1953年就在香港参加了蒋帮特务组织的职业特务，曾经潜入深圳、樟木头等地进行过搜集我军事情报等特务活动。1955年4月，又跑回香港去了。今年4月，香港蒋帮特务机关接到了台湾本部的指示，要在“五一”节对我进行破坏。台湾特务本部还为此特地派了一个姓宋的教官对刘立进行了计时爆破等技术指导。这一切弄妥之后，刘犯就在四月二十九日晚上从香港潜来深圳。五月一日晚上，他按照特务机关的指示，把预先伪装成“阿华田”罐头的定时炸药放到铁轨旁边。这个狡猾的职业特务，在放好炸药以后，很快便又逃回香港去了。
    第二天，罪犯刘立在香港醉琼楼出现了，有不少特务分子在那里为他庆“功”。刘犯不但获得了“勇敢、能干”的“赞誉”，还得到了金钱的奖励。但是也有人不满足地说：“可惜这回叫共产党损失的太少！”
    不久，刘犯又接受了特务机关的一项新的任务，携带着电台零件再次混进深圳来。
    五月三十一日早晨，一个“旅客”从香港越过罗湖桥来到深圳。在到达深圳后的一整天里，他想尽办法消磨时光，等候着黑夜的来临。电灯亮了的时候，他还买票到戏院看了一场戏。晚上九时三十分，戏院散场了，他才回到他早已定好了房间的新新旅店。这位“旅客”就是一月前爆炸铁路的特务刘立。
    当刘犯刚把房门拉开，突然公安人员出现在他的面前。他顿时如梦方醒地打了一个寒颤说：“完了！”
