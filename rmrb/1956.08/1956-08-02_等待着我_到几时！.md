    When Will "Waiting for Me" End!
    Editor:
    There is a problem that has been bothering me.

    In June 1949, I joined the People's Liberation Army. When I said goodbye to my fiancée, she told me, "Don't worry, I will always wait for you." We didn't see each other for several years, only pouring out our longing in letters.

    In 1954, I was transferred to work at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau in Jiangxi. In January of last year, my fiancée took leave to come to me, and we got married. However, because we did not work in the same place, we had to separate again soon after the marriage.

    My wife works at the Shanghai Hailong Paper Mill and has skilled papermaking techniques, which are not suitable for mine work. Therefore, I have repeatedly requested the leadership to transfer me to work in Shanghai. However, the leadership always tells me, "You are one of the 'most beloved people,' how can you not overcome this little difficulty?" I also wrote five letters to the Personnel Department of the Wuhan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry for this matter, but I have not received a reply.

    Our long-term separation causes each other some pain. She often writes to me asking, "When can we be reunited?" I hope that the relevant leaders can consider my problem, so that we can be reunited soon and our family can get rid of difficulties as soon as possible.

### “等待着我”到几时！

    “等待着我”到几时！编辑同志：
    有这样一个问题，一直在苦恼着我。
    1949年6月，我报名参加了人民解放军，我和我的未婚妻告别的时候她曾对我说：“你放心吧，我永远等着你。”几年中，我们没有见过面，只有在来往的信件中倾吐彼此的思念。
    1954年我转业到江西萍乡矿务局工作。去年一月，我的未婚妻请假到我这里，我们结了婚。只是因为我们不在一地工作，婚后不久就不得不再度分离。
    我爱人在上海海龙造纸厂工作，有熟练的造纸技术，不适合矿山工作。因此，我曾数次向领导上提出，调我到上海工作。可是领导上总对我讲：“你是‘最可爱的人’，怎么连这点困难都克服不了？”为这件事，我还给煤炭工业部武汉管理局人事处写过五封信，也一直没有收到他们的回信。
    我们长期分离，互相都感到一些痛苦。她时常来信问我：“我们何时才能团圆呢？”我希望有关领导上能够考虑我的问题，使我们早日团圆，使我们家庭早日摆脱困难。
