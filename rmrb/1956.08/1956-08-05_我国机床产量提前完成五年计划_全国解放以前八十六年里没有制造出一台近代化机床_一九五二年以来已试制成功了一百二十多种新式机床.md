Xinhua News Agency, August 4th. The output of metal cutting machine tools in state-owned machinery industry had reached 131% of the state-specified 1957 level by the end of June, completing the output task of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

This year, China's machine tool production reached an unprecedented high. In the first half of the year, the output of machine tools from state-owned factories increased by more than 1.4 times compared to the same period last year, and the estimated annual output will increase by more than 1.5 times compared to 1952.

From 1862, when China first had a mechanical industry, until the national liberation, no modern machine tool was manufactured in the eighty-six years. After initial technical transformations of the existing enterprises, the first batch of modern machine tools was trial-produced in 1952. Since then, China has successfully trial-produced more than 120 new types of machine tools, including automatic and semi-automatic machine tools.

In recent years, China's machinery industry has increasingly adopted domestically produced machine tools. Several large and precision workpieces that previously required imported machine tools for processing can now be processed by domestic machine tools, including processing of train axles, wheels, machine tool beds, large rolling mill rolls, complex cutting tools, gears, etc.

    我国机床产量提前完成五年计划
    全国解放以前八十六年里没有制造出一台近代化机床
    一九五二年以来已试制成功了一百二十多种新式机床
    新华社4日讯　国营机械工业金属切削机床的产量到六月底已经达到国家规定的1957年水平的131％，提前完成了第一个五年计划的产量任务。
    今年我国机床的产量达到了空前的高度。上半年各国营厂机床的产量比去年同期增加了一点四倍以上，预计全年的产量将比1952年增加一点五倍以上。
    我国从有机械工业的1862年起，到全国解放时为止的八十六年里，没有制造出一台近代化的机床。经过对原有企业的初步的技术改造，1952年试制出第一批近代化的机床。从那时以来，我国已经试制成功了一百二十多种新式机床，其中包括自动和半自动的机床。
    最近几年来，我国机械工业已经越来越多地采用国产的机床装备。过去需要依赖进口的机床才能加工的若干大型的和精密的工作物，现在已经可以由国产机床来加工，其中包括加工火车车轴、车轮、机床床身、大型轧钢机轧辊、复杂刃具、齿轮等。
