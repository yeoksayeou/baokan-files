Xinhua News Agency, 10th, Nagasaki dispatch: Delegates from various countries and Japanese representatives attending the Second World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs today divided into six groups to discuss various issues related to the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

The six groups discussed the following six issues respectively: 1. Prohibition of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and disarmament; 2. Stopping the testing of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs; 3. Peaceful use of atomic energy; 4. The destructive situation of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and methods for aiding victims; 5. Peace movement; 6. Movement to protect life.

The conclusions reached by each group will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion tomorrow.

Yesterday afternoon, the conference continued to hold a plenary session. Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee, Yoshitaro Hirano, made a report on "Regarding the Prohibition of Atomic Bombs and Hydrogen Bombs and Disarmament Issues," Professor Ichiro Moritaki of Hiroshima University, a victim of the atomic bomb, made a report on "The Truth About Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Victims and Relief Issues," and Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Tohtaro Fujita, made a report on "Peace Movement" issues.

Watanabe Chieko, a representative of atomic bomb victims in Nagasaki who lost both legs in the atomic bombing, was helped onto the stage by her mother. She tearfully and indignantly denounced the disaster brought to her by the American atomic bomb. She said: The American atomic bomb destroyed my body, but it cannot destroy my heart. The First World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima last year gave me the love and encouragement like a loving mother, and I have made up my mind: to live on resolutely! Watanabe's tragic experience and her resolute will to defend peace deeply moved all the delegates. Representatives of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and people who suffered from the American hydrogen bomb disaster in Bikini also reported on their suffering at the meeting.

Delegates from various countries then spoke at the meeting. Xu Guangping, head of the Chinese delegation, said: The movement to ban atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs has now become a large-scale world movement. Today, we are holding the Second World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs here, once again expressing the serious demands of peace-loving people all over the world. She said that only when all countries in the world declare the manufacture, storage, use, and testing of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other large-scale destructive weapons illegal, and completely destroy atomic weapons and use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, can mankind achieve true peace. She called on peace-loving people all over the world to unite closely and oppose atomic war. Xu Guangping expressed great sympathy for the suffering of the Japanese people who suffered from the atomic bomb disaster, and handed over the letter of condolence and a donation of 50,000 yuan in Renminbi entrusted by six Chinese people's organizations to Ikuo Yasui, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. All the delegates expressed their gratitude with warm applause, and Yasui also gave a speech at the meeting in reply.

The representative of Romania, Iaburian, representing the International Organization of Journalists, called on: "All journalists in the world should participate in this great struggle to ban atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs."

The representative of Italy, Keshadi, donated $1,000 to the atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the meeting. He also called for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

The Soviet representative, Sofronov, said at the meeting: "I firmly believe that humanity will soon be liberated from the threat of nuclear weapons."
