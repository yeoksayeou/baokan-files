    Friends! Before we leave this city, I would like to say a few words. First of all, on behalf of our delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese people and the people of Beijing, who have been our hosts during our visit to this country.

    Friends! We have been here for a week. Indeed, it is not enough for us to understand all aspects of this place in a week. However, in this short period, we have seen the fraternal feelings of the Chinese people towards the Indonesian people. For this, I once again express my deep gratitude.

    Friends! The Chinese people are happy because they have the lofty ideal of building a new socialist society, and in this construction endeavor, they also have a capable, loyal, experienced, and strong great leader. Friends! I believe that the great construction currently being carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of their leader will be able to achieve its goal and will be completed in a short time.

    Friends! We had the opportunity to meet with your leaders and also had the opportunity to exchange opinions with them. I believe that this in-depth exchange of opinions will not only further enhance our mutual understanding but also enrich our mutual experience.

    We are about to leave this city and will bring back beautiful and good memories and impressions from this visit. The Chinese people are amiable, obedient to the leadership of the country, and able to work and overcome difficulties with perseverance in order to defend the future days of their children and grandchildren.

    I express my respect for the strong perseverance shown by the Chinese people in national construction. Friends! I have learned many experiences from your leaders. I pray for the Chinese people, may they be blessed by Allah in the cause of building a new society, and may they, under the leadership of their great leader, be able to build China into a prosperous and just country in the shortest possible time.

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people!
    Long live the friendship between Asian countries moving towards world peace!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live all the Chinese people!
    Long live the people of Beijing!
    Goodbye!

    朋友们！我们在这里逗留已经一个星期了。的确，对我们来说，以一个星期的时间去了解这里各方面的情况是不够的。但是，在这个短时间内，我们看到了中国人民对印度尼西亚人民的兄弟般的感情。为此，我再一次表示深切的感谢。

    我们就要离开这个城市了，并且将从这次的访问带回优美的和良好的回忆和印象。中国人民是和蔼可亲的，是服从国家领导的，是能够为保卫自己的子孙的未来日子而坚毅不拔地劳动和克服困难的。
