Anshan Iron and Steel's Construction Machinery Can Do More
Feng Shiming

    To ensure the early completion of the Anshan Iron and Steel Base, the state has equipped Anshan Iron and Steel's construction teams with a large number of the most advanced construction machinery. If the investment in Anshan Iron and Steel's construction machinery is taken as 100 in 1953, it will increase to 320 in 1956. The number of mechanical equipment is now eleven times more than in 1953. The development of mechanized construction has accelerated the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. For example, to construct a certain steel rolling mill, earth was taken from 15 kilometers away to fill the depression, and the amount of earthwork reached 1.45 million cubic meters; if it were done manually, it would take 1,000 workers four years. With mechanized construction, only three excavators, more than 40 dump trucks, and a part of the trains were used, and it was all completed in more than eight months.
    Although mechanized construction has shown great advantages in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, there are still many problems. According to statistics in 1955, six projects in Anshan failed to meet the specified mechanization targets. The completion of mechanization indicators in the first half of this year is also not good. In terms of earthwork mechanization, the actual amount of earthwork excavated from January to May this year was 1.42 million cubic meters, of which only 430,000 cubic meters were completed by machinery, and the mechanization level only reached 31%. That is to say, 70%, which is equivalent to 1 million cubic meters of earthwork, was completed manually. There is no doubt that if Anshan Iron and Steel could reach the state's specified mechanization targets, the progress of construction projects would be further accelerated.
    So, what is the reason for failing to complete the mechanization targets? Some people say that it is because there is not enough machinery. Of course, insufficient machinery may be one reason, and the types of some machinery are not very complete. However, according to the actual situation in Anshan, the most important and fundamental reason is that the utilization rate of existing machinery is low, and the huge potential in mechanical equipment has not been fully exploited. Judging from the machinery usage in 1955, when the machinery utilization rate was the highest, the average time utilization rate of the seven types of heavy construction machinery (excavators, tractors, tank-type cranes, tower cranes, etc.) in Anshan only reached 53%. In addition to regular mechanical maintenance and climate impact, at least 30% of the effectiveness has not been exerted. In the first half of this year, the overall shift utilization rate of all earthwork machinery of the Anshan Earthwork Mechanization Company was only 43%; among them, the planned working shifts of excavators from January to May were 2,564, but only 1,448 shifts were actually worked, only completing 56% of the plan. If the excavators could complete the shift utilization plan, at least 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork could be completed.
    Another prominent manifestation of low machinery utilization is the large number of available machines being idle. According to statistics from the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, in 1955, there were more than 1,500 machines that had been idle for a long time, accounting for 24% of the total number of machines. Among them, two highly efficient multi-bucket excavators had only been used for 25 days from October 1954 to June this year.
    The primary reason for the low machinery utilization rate is the backwardness of mechanical maintenance, with large numbers of machines often being repaired in the warehouse. For example, May this year was the best season for construction. The frozen soil in winter had melted, and the rainy season had not yet arrived, but in this month, the overall machinery utilization rate of the Anshan Earthwork Mechanization Company only reached 42.7%. Why? It turned out that 48% of the machinery was being repaired in the factory. Due to lack of attention to maintenance in normal times and failure to earnestly implement the scheduled maintenance system, most machines could not reach the overhaul interval quota. For example, the single-bucket excavator with a bucket capacity of one cubic meter produced in Czechoslovakia, according to the state quota, should work 11,520 hours before undergoing a major overhaul, but in reality, it could not work after less than 3,544 hours and had to be shut down for major repairs. In terms of repair work, it is "long construction period, low quality." The Anshan Machinery Repair Factory, which is responsible for the major repairs of all heavy construction machinery, repaired and delivered a total of 142 machines in the first half of this year, of which 84 were delivered behind schedule, and 31 were returned for repairs after delivery. One truck crane was sent to the factory for repairs in December 1954 and was not delivered until June this year, a total of more than 540 days (planned construction period was 35 days), and it was reworked eight times during the repair process.
    Closely related to the backwardness of mechanical maintenance is the insufficient supply of mechanical spare parts. Any machine must replace worn parts during the repair process. Without sufficient mechanical spare parts reserves, it is impossible to ensure shortening the repair period. In the first half of this year, the Anshan Machinery Repair Factory delayed the repair of machinery for a total of more than 1,800 days, of which more than 800 days were due to waiting for spare parts. The lack of spare parts also caused downtime during mechanical construction. In April this year, an electric shovel with a bucket capacity of three cubic meters from the Anshan Earthwork Mechanization Company only worked for 20 days, and the remaining 10 days were shut down due to lack of pick teeth, resulting in 15,000 cubic meters less earthwork completed.
    Another reason for the low machinery utilization rate is frequent mechanical accidents. In 1955, there were more than 600 mechanical accidents in the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, of which 387 were caused by violations of operating procedures and maintenance procedures. The problem is still very serious this year. In the first quarter alone, there were 135 mechanical accidents. The large number of mechanical accidents seriously affects the effectiveness of the machinery. In the first half of this year, the excavator alone, due to mechanical accidents, stopped working for 152 shifts, equivalent to more than 40,000 cubic meters of workload.
    To fully exert the effectiveness of machinery, doing a good job in construction organization is also very important. Anshan's work in this area is relatively weak. In terms of machinery supply, a blind supply method of "asking for more and giving less, asking for less and not giving, giving to those who ask first" is often adopted, and machinery is rarely prepared early according to the project situation. During the construction process, the coordination between machines is not good, which often limits the effectiveness of the machines. Taking the excavator driven by the excellent excavator operator Lang Yunzhi as an example, he completed the excavation of 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork in the first half of the year, which is the highest output among all excavators; but even so, his excavator stopped working for 116 shifts due to insufficient supply and poor coordination of earth-moving trucks. If the coordination between excavators and trucks were well organized, he could have completed at least 40,000 cubic meters more earthwork.
    Decentralized machinery management is also one of the factors affecting the improvement of machinery utilization. In order to implement the principle of key use, it is required to adopt a centralized management form in machinery management, which is of great benefit to flexible scheduling, mutual adjustment, and full exertion of the effectiveness of machinery. However, at present, in the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, except for 15% of the heavy machinery that is under centralized management, 85% of the machinery is still decentralized and managed by the affiliated companies themselves. This not only brings many difficulties to machinery scheduling, but also has many disadvantages in terms of machinery maintenance and management.
    Judging from the current situation in Anshan, to further expand the scale of mechanized construction, the key is not to simply increase the number of machines, but to improve the utilization rate of existing machines.

    鞍钢的施工机械能做更多的事
    冯世明
    为了保证提前建成鞍山钢铁基地，国家用大量的最先进的建筑机械装备了鞍钢的建筑队伍。对鞍钢建筑机械的投资，若以1953年为一百，1956年就增长到三百二十。目前机械设备的数量比1953年多十一倍。机械化施工的发展，加速了鞍钢的建设。如建设某轧钢厂，要从十五公里以外取土来填实洼地，土方工作量达一百四十五万立方公尺；如果用人工来干，要一千个工人干四年，实行机械化施工，只用了三台挖土机、四十多辆自卸汽车，加上一部分火车，八个多月就全部完成了。
    虽然机械化施工在鞍钢建设中显示了巨大的优越性，但是存在的问题还很多，据1955年统计，鞍山有六项工程没有达到规定的机械化指标。今年上半年的机械化指标完成的情况也是不好的。在土方机械化方面，今年一月至五月实际完成的挖土工作量是一百四十二万立方公尺，其中用机械完成的只有四十三万立方公尺，机械化水平仅达到31％。这就是说，有70％，即相当于一百万立方公尺的土方是用人工完成的。毫无疑问，假若鞍钢能够达到国家规定的机械化指标的话，建设工程的进度将会更加加快。
    那末，完不成机械化指标的原因是什么呢？有人说是由于机械不够。当然，机械不够可能是一个原因，而且有的机械种类还不很全。但是，根据鞍山的实际情况看来，最重要的、最根本的原因则是现有机械利用率低，机械设备中存在的巨大潜力还没有充分发挥出来。从机械利用率最高的1955年机械使用情况来看，鞍山七种重型建筑机械（挖土机、拖拉机、坦克式吊车、塔式吊车等）的时间利用率平均只达到53％，除了机械定期检修、气候影响外，至少有30％的效能没有发挥。今年上半年鞍山土方机械化公司的全部土方机械台班利用率仅达43％；其中挖土机一月至五月的计划工作台班是二千五百六十四个，实际只工作了一千四百四十八个台班，只完成计划的56％，假若挖土机能够完成台班利用计划的话，至少可以多完成三十万立方公尺的土方。
    机械利用率低的另一个突出表现是大批可用的机械闲置不用。根据鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司统计，1955年来长期闲置不用的机械有一千五百多台，占全部机械总数的24％，其中有两台高度效率的多斗挖土机从1954年10月开始，到今年6月，只用了二十五天。
    机械利用率低的首要原因是机械检修保养工作落后，经常有大批的机械在库内停修。例如今年五月份是施工最好的季节，冬天冻土已化，雨季尚未来临，但这个月份鞍山土方机械化公司的全部机械利用率只达到42.7％。为什么呢？原来有48％的机械在厂内修理。由于平时不注意维护，又没有认真执行预期检修制度，大部分机械达不到检修间隔期定额。如捷克出产的斗容量一立方公尺单斗挖土机，根据国家定额应该工作一万一千五百二十小时才进行一次大修，而实际上不到三千五百四十四小时就不能工作，只好停车大修。在修理工作方面则是“工期长、质量低”。担负全部重型建筑机械大修工作的鞍山机械修理厂，今年上半年修理出厂的机械共有一百四十二台，其中拖期出厂的就有八十四台，出厂后又返修的有三十一台。有一台汽车式起重机，从1954年12月进厂修理，到今年六月才出厂，共修了五百四十多天（计划工期三十五天），在修理过程中就返工八次之多。
    同机械检修保养工作落后有密切关系的是机械备件供应不足。任何机械在修理过程中都必须更换已经磨损了的零件，没有足够的机械备件储备，就不能保证缩短检修工期。今年上半年鞍山机械修理厂修理的机械总共拖期一千八百多天，其中由于等待备件的就有八百多天。备件缺乏也造成机械施工过程中的停工。今年四月份鞍山土方机械化公司有一台斗容量三立方公尺的电铲，只工作了二十天，其余十天就由于缺少镐牙而停工，少完成土方一万五千立方公尺。
    机械利用率低的另一个原因是机械事故频繁。1955年鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司发生的机械事故有六百多件，其中由于违反操作规程和保养规程造成的就有三百八十七件。今年问题仍很严重，仅第一季度就发生了机械事故一百三十五件。机械事故一多，就严重地影响机械效能的发挥，今年上半年仅挖土机一种机械，由于发生机械事故就停工了一百五十二个台班，相当于四万多立方公尺的工作量。
    要想充分发挥机械效能，做好施工组织工作也有十分重要的作用。鞍山这方面的工作是比较薄弱的。在机械供应上，往往采取“多要少给，少要不给，先要先给”的盲目供应办法，很少根据工程情况及早地准备机械。在施工过程中，由于机械与机械之间配合不好，常常限制机械效能的发挥。以优秀挖土机手郎运治所驾驶的挖土机为例，他在上半年完成了十万立方公尺土方的挖掘任务，是所有挖土机中产量最高的；但即使如此，他的挖土机由于运土汽车供给不足、配合不好而造成的停工就有一百一十六个台班，假若挖土机和汽车的配合组织得好的话，他至少还可以多完成四万立方公尺土方。
    机械管理分散也是影响机械利用率提高的因素之一。为了贯彻执行重点使用的方针，要求在机械管理上采取集中管理的形式，这对灵活调度，互相调剂、充分发挥机械的效能有很大的好处。但是鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司目前除了占15％的重型机械实行集中管理外，85％的机械还都分散在所属各公司自行管理，这样不仅给机械调度上带来很多困难，而且在机械维护管理方面都有许多不利的地方。
    从鞍山目前的情况看来，要想进一步扩大机械化施工的规模，关键不在于单纯增加机械数量，而在于提高现有机械的利用率。
