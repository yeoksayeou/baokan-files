　　In Mr. Lu Xun's short story "Storm," there is a character called "Old Mrs. Ninepound." She is very old, seventy-nine years old. It is said that her husband—the text refers to her husband—weighed nine pounds at birth, and after that, her descendants steadily declined: seven pounds, six pounds... Therefore, this Old Mrs. Ninepound looked down on everything and always said, "Each generation is worse than the last!"

　　I think this Old Mrs. Ninepound mentality has not completely disappeared today.

　　Since two young people came forward to criticize senior scholars the year before last, the slogan "emphasize new forces" has attracted considerable attention, but the problem has not been completely solved, and the spirit of Old Mrs. Ninepound is still attached to some people.

　　Recently, the whole country has been actively preparing to appropriately increase the salaries of staff members, and this issue has been sharply raised again. Some workers and staff members were six pounds after the national liberation, and they are still six pounds now. In reality, some of them who have progressed quickly are no longer six pounds, but seven pounds, eight pounds, or even weigh as much as or even more than Old Mrs. Ninepound. However, some of our Old Mrs. Ninepound-style leaders are unwilling to admit this, always feeling that they weigh at most three to five pounds. If you say they weigh six or seven pounds, that won't do; if you say they weigh eight pounds, almost as much as themselves, that would be terrible; if you say they already weigh nine pounds or even nine and a half pounds, "that's simply rebellion!"

　　A few days ago, there was a short article in this newspaper talking about "busy," saying that many people are busy talking about "busy" verbally. I would like to add that these people are also often busy talking about another thing, which is: the lack of cadres.

　　Some Old Mrs. Ninepound-style figures always feel that young people—here I mean relatively young people, including those over thirty—are not good enough in this way or that way. In fact, this is often the result of not letting them do it. People always have a bit of inertia of "not being in a position, not planning its affairs." If you don't put them in a certain position to train, they will certainly never learn. Yes, they may not be able to handle a certain job satisfactorily for the time being, but are some of our Old Mrs. Ninepounds themselves perfect scales, capable of handling everything satisfactorily? If you think carefully, you may also realize something yourself. Moreover, some modern Old Mrs. Ninepounds only have the conservatism of Old Mrs. Ninepound, but not the weight of Old Mrs. Ninepound, then they should examine themselves even more.

　　I also feel that some people who are good at discovering cadres have not received the encouragement they deserve. He turns the people under his leadership from six pounds to seven pounds, eight pounds, batch after batch, but someone next to him might say: So-and-so is really not good, look, everyone is catching up with him. This is a good intention not being rewarded. In this situation, even if there are still Old Mrs. Ninepounds above causing trouble, it will affect some people who originally didn't want to be Old Mrs. Ninepound, making them a bit like Old Mrs. Ninepound.

　　Typical Old Mrs. Ninepounds are of course very rare today, but people with some degree of Old Mrs. Ninepound mentality are not uncommon. To a certain extent, they are obstacles on the road of national progress. I hope that everyone who is qualified to be an Old Mrs. Ninepound will find Lu Xun's article to read. It is very short and included in the collection of short stories "Call to Arms." It only takes ten minutes to read.

    九斤老太论
    严秀
    鲁迅先生的短篇小说“风波”里，有一位人物，叫做“九斤老太”，老的很，七十九岁了。据说她的丈夫——看文章是指她的丈夫——生下地来就有九斤重，以后她的后代都每况愈下：七斤、六斤……。因此这位九斤老太便一切都看不上眼，开口闭口就是：“一代不如一代！”
    我觉得，这种九斤老太思想，在今天并没有完全绝迹呢。
    前年，自从两位年青人起来批评前辈的学者以后，“重视新生力量”这句口号，已经相当引起人们的重视了，不过，并没有完全解决问题，九斤老太的魂魄还附在某些人的身上。
    最近，全国都在积极准备适当增加工作人员的工薪了，这个问题又尖锐地被提了出来。有些工人和工作人员，在全国解放后是六斤，现在还是六斤。实际上，他们中的某些进步快的人，早已不是六斤，而是七斤、八斤，或者已经和九斤老太一样重甚至比九斤老太还要重了。但是，我们的某些九斤老太式的领导人不愿意承认这一点，总觉得他们至多不过三、五斤，要说有六、七斤，就不行，要说有八斤，快与自己差不多了，那还了得，要说已经有九斤甚至九斤半了，“那简直是造反！”
    前几天，就在本报上有一篇谈“忙”的短文章，说很多人忙于在口头上谈“忙”，我现在还要补充一点，就是这类人还往往忙于谈论另一件事，就是：没有干部。
    有些九斤老太式的人物，总觉得年青人——这里是说相对的年青人，三十岁以上的也可以包括进去——这样不行，那样不行。其实这往往是不要他去做的结果。人总是有一点“不在其位，不谋其政”的惰性，你不放他在一定的岗位上去锻炼，他当然永远也学不会。是的，他暂时对某一项工作是不能胜任愉快的，但是，我们的某些九斤老太自己就是十足天秤、胜任愉快么，仔细想想，恐怕自己也会有所觉悟的。而且，有些现代的九斤老太还是只有九斤老太之保守，而没有九斤老太的重量的，那就更应该反躬自问一下了。
    我还感觉到，有些善于发现干部的人，没有得到应有的鼓励。他把他领导下的人，一批批地从六斤变成七斤、八斤，但是旁边却可能有人说：某某人真不行，看看一个个地都赶上他了。这是好心没有得到好报。在这种情形之下，就是上面还有九斤老太在作怪，影响到某些本来不想做九斤老太的人，也有点九斤老太的味道了。
    典型的九斤老太，在今天当然是极个别的，可是具有某种程度的九斤老太味道的人，就不是稀罕的了。他们在一定程度上是国家前进道路上的障碍。希望每一个有资格做九斤老太的人，都把鲁迅的这篇文章找来看看，很短，收在小说集“呐喊”里，十分钟就可以看完的。
