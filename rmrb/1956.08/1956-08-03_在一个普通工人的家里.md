    In the Home of an Ordinary Worker
    By our reporter Qin Junguang
    The director of the family committee of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory led me into the workers' residential area. Hundreds of ordinary workers' families live here, and in front of each house are planted some endearing flowers, including the blooming passionflower, the bright and dazzling German orchid, as well as cannas, chrysanthemums, hydrangeas…

    The director of the family committee said to me: "These rows of bungalows, some are newly built after liberation, and some are newly renovated. Each row of houses can accommodate a dozen families, each family occupies a door, and inside each door there are either two rooms or three rooms. Look at these small vegetable plots, they are all vegetables grown by the family members themselves."

    As she spoke, the director of the family committee led me into the home of worker Ou Fengxiang. Here, a large room was divided into three small rooms. The room facing the door was the kitchen, and the other two rooms were where Old Ou, his wife, and their five children lived. Although the room was not large, the beds, tables, chairs, wooden boxes, and wooden cabinets were placed in an organized manner, and the room was cleaned spotlessly. Ou Fengxiang is an old worker nearing fifty years old. He was recently injured at work and is recuperating at home after treatment. He was playing with his youngest son on the bed. Hearing someone speaking, he turned from the bed and grabbed his crutches to get out of bed. The little son cried, not wanting his father to leave. His wife, Zhang Huilan, said to me: "Please don't laugh, there are so many children that the house is too dirty!"

    We walked into the inner room and sat on the bed with the floral bedspread. Ou Fengxiang's nine-year-old son, Ou Jinbao, brought two glasses of boiled water and put them on the table. Zhang Huilan then opened the back door, and the room was instantly bright. I saw a glass frame hanging on the wall, the frame was not large, but it was full of photos. In the middle was a large six-inch photo, a group photo of all of Ou Fengxiang's colleagues, and there was also a large four-inch photo, a "family portrait". Seeing me looking at the photos, Zhang Huilan hurried over and pointed to each one to introduce them to me.

    At twelve o'clock, the factory's whistle sounded long and loud. It was lunchtime for the Ou Fengxiang family. Except for the youngest, who was lying in his mother's arms drinking milk, the other children each held their own bowls and ate, without needing their mother to take care of them. Today they were eating white rice, stir-fried cabbage and eggplant with chili, and a small melon soup. Ou Fengxiang said: "Now you can't buy pork or lard, so the stir-fried vegetables don't taste very good." Zhang Huilan added: "Some time ago, we could still improve our living conditions every week, but now the pork supply can't keep up, so everything is spared."

    "With a family of seven like yours, how much do you spend each month?" I asked.

    Zhang Huilan sat on a small stool, counting on her fingers as she gave me an account, and carefully explained her family plan: "When the salary is paid, we first buy all the food. According to our population, 154 jin of grain a month is enough. This hundred or so jin of grain costs more than nine yuan. As for oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and soap, it's no more than six yuan a month. The most expensive thing now is firewood, which costs no less than six yuan a month. His father also has to spend two yuan on cigarettes, and three yuan for rent and utilities, and a few jiao for union dues. Each month, the medical expenses for these five children and one adult have to deduct six yuan. Watching movies, going to the city by car, and buying snacks for the children also costs three or five yuan. To be generous, the monthly expenses are more than forty yuan."

    "How much does Comrade Ou earn each month?" I asked.

    "He's a fourth-grade worker, with a monthly salary of a little over fifty yuan."

    "What about your clothes?"

    "Doesn't there still a little money left over each month! I deposit this money in the bank and make clothes for the children and adults every season." Zhang Huilan paused and continued: "We save money on vegetables. I opened up a little land in the front slope and planted some chili peppers, chives, cabbage, winter melon, eggplant, as well as cowpeas and corn, so we don't have to go to the street to buy vegetables. We even sold some of the vegetables we couldn't eat!" Ou Fengxiang added: "That's right! The dried vegetables we dried last year haven't finished eating yet! She sold more than thirty yuan and bought some new clothes for the children."

    As they were talking, two crane operators from Ou Fengxiang's group came in. They were here to ask Ou Fengxiang how to connect the large steel ropes. Ou Fengxiang said to them: "I'll be back to work in a few days, don't worry." One of the two, named Wang Jihong, said: "Don't worry, we'll come to you if we need anything."

    After they left, we continued the interrupted conversation. Ou Fengxiang told me about his work-related injury: "I've been working in the factory for ten years and have never had an accident. This time, I was caught in the advanced producer movement and injured my foot. At the time, I didn't think much of it, and went to work the next day, but when I put force on my foot, it hurt so much that I couldn't bear it. I went to the clinic and asked the doctor to take a look. I thought that applying some red medicine would be enough, but who knew he would send me to the rehabilitation hospital by car. When I got to the hospital, I found out that the bone inside was broken. I thought to myself: 'What should I do! Can I rely on labor insurance to eat?' I was annoyed, and I only hated being too careless at work. I stayed in the hospital for more than ten days, and took another X-ray. The doctor said my foot was healed and the bones had grown back together. I was so happy that I couldn't help but shout: 'Long live the Communist Party!' I couldn't wait to go back to the factory and go to work." Ou Fengxiang said with a smile, taking a puff of smoke and continuing: "Who knew that when I was about to leave the hospital, the doctor asked me to continue resting at home."

    "How long have you been resting?"

    "Two and a half months!"

    "What about your salary?"

    "Paid as usual!"

    "What about medical expenses?"

    "All paid by the factory."

    "Have any cadres from the factory come to see you?"

    "Yes, our workshop director and section chief heard that I was discharged from the hospital and came to comfort me, telling me to rest well."

    The children saw that their father had never been so talkative as today, and stared at him with their bright eyes, watching him without blinking. Ou Xiaowu playfully climbed on Old Ou's back, wanting him to carry him around. Old Ou carried Xiaowu and swayed back and forth, continuing: "My qualifications are not good enough, but I want to strive to join the Party; even if I can't join the Party, I still have several children! I will definitely educate them to join the Party when they grow up."

    在一个普通工人的家里
    本报记者　秦军光
    昆明机床厂家属委员会主任把我领进工人住宅区。这里居住着几百个普通工人的家庭，每户门前都种植着一些逗人喜爱的花，有正在盛开的西番莲，有鲜艳夺目的德国兰，还有美人蕉、菊花、绣球……。
    家属委员会主任对我说：“这些一排排的平房，有些是解放后新盖的，有些是新翻修的。每排房子可以住十几家，每一家占一个门，每一个门里有的是两间房，也有是三间的。你再看这些小块块的菜畦，都是家属们自己种的蔬菜。”
    说着，家属委员会主任带我跨进了工人欧凤祥的家。这里，一大间房被隔成了三小间，当门一间是厨房，还有两间是老欧夫妻俩个同五个儿女们住的。虽然房间不大，可是床铺、桌椅、木箱、木柜放得有条有理，房间收拾得干干净净。欧凤祥是一个近五十岁的老工人，最近因工负伤，治愈后在家休养。他正同小儿子在床上逗着玩，听见有人说话，从床上侧身起来，顺手抓着双拐下了床，小儿子哇哇地哭着不让爸爸离开。他的妻子张慧兰对我说：“你可别笑话，孩子多，房子弄得太脏啦！”
    我们走进了里间房，坐在铺着花床单的床上。欧凤祥九岁的儿子欧进宝端来两杯开水放在桌上。张慧兰随即打开了后门，房子里刹时亮堂堂的。我看见墙上挂着一个玻璃镜框，镜框不算大，照片却放得满满的。当中有一张大的六寸像片，是欧凤祥全班同事的合影，还有一张大的四寸像片，是“合家欢”。张慧兰见我在看像片，忙走近来用指头点着一个一个给我介绍。
    十二点钟，工厂里下班汽笛拉长着声音呜呜的叫起来。是老欧全家吃午饭的时候了。除了小五躺在妈妈怀里吃奶以外，别的孩子各人端着各人的碗吃饭，不用妈妈照顾。他们今天吃的是白米饭，菜是炒莲花白菜和辣椒茄子渣，还有一个小瓜汤。欧凤祥说：“现在买不到猪肉、猪油，菜炒出来也没有什么味道。”张慧兰接着说：“前些时候每个礼拜还改善改善生活，现在猪肉供应不上，什么都免了。”
    “像你们这样七口之家，每月的开支得多少钱？”我问。
    张慧兰在小凳上坐着，搬着手指头给我算了一笔账，并把她的家庭计划仔细的说了一遍：“工资发下来，我们先把吃的置买齐，按照我们的人口，一个月有一百五十四斤粮食也就够了。这百十斤粮食得九元多钱。至于油、盐、酱、醋、肥皂，一个月也不过六元钱。现在花钱多的还是烧柴，哪个月也不下六元钱。他爸爸还得花两元钱的纸烟钱，还要交三元钱的房租水电费和几角钱的工会会费。每个月这五个孩子一个大人的医药费得扣除六圆钱。一家人看电影、进城坐车，还要给孩子们买点零食吃，这样也还得三、五元钱。从宽处算，每月开销得四十多元钱。”
    “老欧同志每月收入多少钱？”我问。
    “他是四级工，每月工资五十元多一点。”
    “你们穿衣服怎么办？”
    “不是每月还能剩一点钱吗！我就把这点钱存入银行，按季给孩子大人做衣服。”张慧兰停了停又继续说：“我们的小菜钱是省着的，我在前边岗子上开了一点地，种了些辣椒、韭菜、莲花白、老窝瓜、茄子，还有豆角、包谷，这就不用上街买小菜了。我们吃不完的菜还卖了一些呢！”欧凤祥接着说：“可不是！去年晒的菜干现在还没吃完呢！她卖了三十多元钱，给孩子们添置了几件新衣服”。
    正说着，进来了两个欧凤祥小组里的起重工。他们是来请教欧凤祥，怎样能把大钢绳接起来的。欧凤祥向他们说：“我再休息几天就上工了，你们别着急。”那两个人里面的一个叫王纪鸿的说：“你也别着急，有事我们就来找你。”
    他们走后，我们又继续中断了的谈话。欧凤祥告诉我他因工受伤的经过：“我进厂已经十年了，从来没有发生过事故。这回正赶开展先进生产者运动，我把脚砸着啦。当时我还不觉得怎样，第二天又上工了，可是脚一用力，痛得吃不住劲。我到医务所里让大夫看了看，原以为涂点红药水就行了，谁知道他把我用汽车送到康复医院去。到了医院，才知道里边骨头砸断啦。我心想：‘怎么办呢！我能靠劳保救济吃饭吗？’心里一阵阵的烦恼，只恨工作太大意。在医院住了十几天，又照了一张X光像片，医生说我的脚好了，骨头长住啦，我心里高兴得恨不得大声喊叫：“共产党万岁！”恨不得马上回厂上工。”欧凤祥说到这里笑嘻嘻地吸了一口烟又继续说：“谁知道临出医院，医生又让我在家继续休养。”
    “休养多久啦，”
    “两个半月啦！”
    “你的工资呢？”
    “照发！”
    “医药费呢？”
    “都是厂里出的。”
    “厂里有干部来看过你吗？”
    “来过，我们车间主任和工段长听说我出院啦，都跑来安慰我，叫我好好休养。”
    孩子们看见爸爸从来没有像今天这样爱说话，莫名其妙地瞪着一双双滴溜溜的眼睛，不转眼珠地瞅着他。欧小五顽皮地爬在老欧的背上，要他背起来走走。老欧背着小五一摇一晃地又接着说：“我的条件还不够，不过我是要争取入党的；就算我不能入党，我还有几个孩子呢！我一定教育他们长大加入党。”
