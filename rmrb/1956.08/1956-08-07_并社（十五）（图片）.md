    Merged Cooperatives (15)
    Adapted by Tu Honghen, Illustrated by Jiang Ying
    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    57　A few days later, a red flag rose over Willow Tree Village. The two cooperatives merged, and the office of the advanced cooperative was set up next to the People's School. Three production teams began to reclaim wasteland and build embankments on the meadow, one production team was digging irrigation canals, and two production teams were digging mud pits to accumulate fertilizer... Shuming was elected as the director of the advanced cooperative, and Yinghua was elected as a member of the management committee. They were now seeing each other openly, although Shuming still sought out Yinghua more often.
    As for Li Baichuan, he was waiting for the branch to deal with him. (The End)

    并社（十五）

    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    57　隔了几天，柳树屯上空升起了一面红旗，两个社合并了，高级社的办公室就设在民校的隔壁。三个生产队开始在草甸子上开荒修埂，一个生产队在开挖水渠，两个生产队在挖坑泥积肥……。树明被选为高级社主任，莺花被选为管委会委员。他们已经明来明往了，当然，还是树明找莺花的时候多些。
    李百川呢，在等待支部里对他的处理。（完）
