Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper recently published the opinions of many well-known figures from various sectors of society regarding the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. They all demanded that the Japanese government reach a satisfactory agreement as soon as possible and rapidly restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

    Ichiro Horiye, Vice Chairman of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "What we hope for is that the Japanese government will accept the demands of the people and reach an agreement as soon as possible." He said that the desire of the majority of Japanese people to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only reflected in the results of last year's House of Representatives election, but also clearly demonstrated in the results of this year's House of Councillors election. If Japan and the Soviet Union restore diplomatic relations, the relationship between the two countries will develop step by step not only in the field of fisheries but also in trade and cultural exchanges. Therefore, the sooner an agreement is reached, the more beneficial it will be for Japan.

    Toshio Kuroda, Chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party, said that not only do we demand an early agreement, but most countries in the world also hope that Japan and the Soviet Union will restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible for the sake of world peace. When talking about the territorial issue, he pointed out that Japan had already abandoned its rights to Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island at the San Francisco Conference, and at that time the Japanese government had clearly stated in its replies to inquiries in the Diet that these two islands belonged to the Kuril Islands that Japan had given up under the treaty. Today, Japan is demanding their "return", which is unreasonable internationally.

    Senator Hisako Takata pointed out: "The Soviet-Japanese negotiations are deadlocked on the territorial issue because the Japanese government lacks sincerity."

    Masaru Nozoe, advisor to the Socialist Party, said that the neutral movement centered on countries such as India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia is now developing, and the progress of peaceful and neutral forces is the direction of the world. Under this situation, Shigemitsu should seriously consider the world situation and Japan's position, and must restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other countries as soon as possible.

    Fukazo Ito, Secretary-General of the Japan-China Import and Export Association, said that Western European countries are working hard to trade with the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom is particularly active, while Japan has already fallen behind. This businessman said: "Japan has no reason to sit idly by and do nothing. We very much hope to adjust diplomatic relations as soon as possible and restore normal trade, the sooner the better."

    Saneatsu Mushanokoji, a famous Japanese writer, said that he hopes that Japan and the Soviet Union will restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible. He said that especially many young people expect that after the restoration of diplomatic relations, they will be able to freely interact with the Soviet people and conduct cultural and other exchanges to deepen the understanding between the people of the two countries.

    Political commentator Tatsuo Tsukui pointed out that Japan's restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union can not only open the way for Japan to join the United Nations, solve the fisheries and war criminals repatriation issues, and bring some benefits to Japan, but also be a turning point for Japan to achieve independence and autonomy.

    日本各界人士要求政府迅速同苏联恢复邦交
    认为重光应该认真考虑世界形势和日本的立场
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”最近刊载了很多社会著名人士对苏日谈判的意见，他们都要求日本政府早日使谈判圆满达成协议，迅速同苏联恢复邦交。
    日苏亲善协会副会长堀江邑一说：“我们希望的是日本政府接受国民的要求，早日达成协议。”他说，日本大多数国民要求恢复日苏邦交的愿望不仅表现在去年众议员选举结果上，而且在这次参议员选举结果中也清楚地表现出来了。日苏两国恢复了邦交，两国的关系不仅在渔业方面，而且在贸易和文化交流方面都会一步步地发展。因此，越早达成协议就越对日本有利。
    劳农党主席黑田寿男说，不仅我们要求早日达成协议，而且世界上大多数国家为了世界和平也希望日苏两国早日恢复邦交。他在谈到领土问题的时候指出，日本在旧金山会议上已经放弃了对国后岛和择捉岛的权利，而且当时日本政府在国会里答复质询时曾经明确地说这两个岛属于和约规定日本放弃的千岛群岛。今天，日本又要求“归还”，这在国际上是无理的。
    参议员高田尚子指出：“日苏谈判在领土问题上僵持起来，是因为日本政府没有诚意。”
    社会党顾问野沟胜说，现在以印度、埃及、南斯拉夫等国为中心的中立运动正在发展，和平中立力量的进展是世界的方向。在这种形势下，重光应该认真考虑世界形势和日本的立场，必须早日同苏联、中国等国家恢复邦交。
    日中输出入协会事务局长系井深藏说，西欧各国都在努力同苏联贸易，英国尤其积极，而日本已经落在后面了。这位实业家说：“日本没有理由呆呆地无所作为。我们非常希望尽早调整邦交，并且恢复正常贸易，越早越好。”
    日本有名的文学家武者小路实笃说，他希望日苏两国尽早恢复邦交。他说，特别是很多年青人都期望恢复邦交以后，能够同苏联人民自由来往，进行文化和其他方面的交流，来加深两国人民的了解。
    政治评论家津久井龙雄指出，日本同苏联恢复邦交不仅可以打开日本加入联合国的道路，解决渔业和战犯回国问题，使日本得到一些好处，而且也是日本实现独立自主的一个转折点。
