Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 25th: Leaders of the Japan Socialist Party and the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China-Soviet Diplomatic Relations held a meeting on the afternoon of August 24th and unanimously agreed that Japan-Soviet negotiations must reach an agreement immediately. They also believe that urging the government to reach an agreement on Japan-Soviet negotiations immediately is the most important guiding principle for current work.

Those attending the meeting included Hiroo Wada and Mitsu Kono, Central Executive Committee members of the Japan Socialist Party, Soji Okada, Chairman of the Diet Policy Committee, and Ken Nagai, Supreme Committee member of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, and Tsuguru Mashima, Secretary-General.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Seventh Regular Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today passed a resolution calling for the early restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations.

The resolution, unanimously passed by more than 400 representatives of three million Japanese workers, pointed out that the interruption of Japan-Soviet negotiations at this stage is contrary to the expectations of the Japanese people. The convention expressed its hope that the Japanese government, in order to resolve issues such as fisheries and the issue of unreturned personnel, would postpone the territorial issue for later resolution, so that the negotiations could reach an agreement as soon as possible.

This was the only resolution passed by today's convention. The convention is currently debating the future course of action of "Sohyo." The discussion will continue tomorrow.

    日本社会党等领导人一致认为
    日苏谈判必须立即达成协议
    “总评”大会要求早日恢复日苏邦交
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议的领导人员在八月二十四日下午举行会议，一致认为：日苏谈判必须立即达成协议，并且认为促使政府立即使日苏谈判达成协议是当前最重要的工作方针。
    出席这个会议的有：日本社会党中央执行委员和田博雄、河野密，国会对策委员会主席冈田宗司以及日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议最高委员永井健、事务总长马岛僩等人。
    新华社26日讯　日本工会总评议会第七次定期大会今天通过决议，要求早日恢复日苏邦交。
    这个由三百万日本工人的四百多名代表一致通过的决议指出，日苏谈判在现阶段被中断一事是和日本国民的期待背道而驰的。大会表示期待日本政府为了解决渔业问题和未遣返人员问题等，把领土问题推迟到以后解决，使谈判尽快地达成协议。
    这是今天的大会所通过的唯一的一项决议。大会正在激烈辩论“总评”今后的运动方针。讨论在明天将继续举行。
