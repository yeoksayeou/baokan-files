Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The twenty Japanese fishing boats that came to our ports to seek shelter during the recent typhoon have safely weathered the storm and have left the ports to resume production.

The Japanese fishing boats came to China to seek shelter following a telegram request from the Japan-China Fisheries Association on the afternoon of July 31st. Upon receiving this request, the China Fisheries Association quickly took emergency measures and made proper arrangements to local fisheries associations along the coast. On the morning of the 1st, as the edge of the powerful typhoon entered the Shanghai area and the weather was extremely bad, the Shanghai branch of the China Fisheries Association immediately dispatched ships to brave the wind and rain to meet them after learning about the Japanese fishing boats seeking shelter. That afternoon, eight Japanese fishing boats, including the Tokai Maru and Kyokuto Maru, were guided to the Shanghai port docks. On the morning of the 2nd, when the Choryo Maru and Ebisu Maru pairs of Japanese fishing boats arrived and anchored in Lianyungang, the vice chairman of the China Fisheries Association's Xinhailian City branch even expressed his concern for the Japanese crew members. On the same day, eight Japanese fishing boats, including the Unzen Maru and Yamada Maru, also sailed into Shidao Port to seek shelter.

    在我港口避风的日本渔轮出海生产
    据新华社7日讯　在这次台风侵袭期间先后来我国港口避风的二十艘日本渔轮，已经安全避过台风袭击，分别离开港口出海生产。
    日本渔轮这次前来我国避风，是日本日中渔业协议会在七月三十一日下午打来电报请求的。中国渔业协会接到这种请求后，迅速采取紧急措施，分别向沿海各地渔业协会作了妥善布置。一日上午，强大台风的边缘侵入上海地区，天气十分恶劣，中国渔业协会上海市分会在得知日本渔轮避风的消息以后，立即派出船只冒着大风雨前往迎接。当日下午，东海丸、极东丸等八艘日本渔轮被引到了上海港码头。二日上午，当长渔丸和蛭子丸两对日本渔轮到达连云港，抛锚停泊后，中国渔业协会新海连市分会副主席还慰问了日本船员。同日还有云仙丸、山田丸等八艘日本渔轮也驶进了石岛港避风。
