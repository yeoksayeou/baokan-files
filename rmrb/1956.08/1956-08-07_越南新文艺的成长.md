The Growth of New Vietnamese Literature and Art
General Secretary of the Vietnam Federation of Literary and Art Associations, Ruan Zun

    It has been eleven years since the August Revolution in Vietnam. In this relatively short period, the Vietnamese people have established their own new literature and art. This new literature and art has inherited the excellent traditions of national literature and art and, under the leadership of the Party and the working class, is advancing by leaps and bounds in the direction of serving the people.

    The Vietnamese literary and art circles have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. When the War of Resistance Against France first broke out, all patriotic literary and art workers left the cities and went to the countryside to participate in the fight against aggression. In 1948, the Vietnam Federation of Literary and Art Associations was established. At that time, Comrade Truong Chinh, the General Secretary of the Party, pointed out in his report "Marxism and the Question of Vietnamese Culture" the basic path for establishing national and people's literature and art. Advancing along this path, Vietnamese writers and artists once used their literary and artistic weapons to participate in the battle in difficult and arduous circumstances. They participated in the work of various propaganda and publishing organs, some joined the army to serve the soldiers, some went deep into the enemy-occupied areas, and some went deep into factories and rural areas. Some of them gloriously sacrificed their lives in the war. From 1953, most of the literary and art workers in North Vietnam participated in the mass movement to reduce rent, and later participated in the land reform movement.

    In the long and fierce national liberation struggle and the rural social reform struggle, the anti-French resistance literary and art workers of Vietnam gradually transformed themselves. Most of them abandoned bourgeois literary and artistic ideas and corrected the erroneous view that art should be separated from politics and the broad masses of the people.

    In the vigorous people's movement, many excellent literary and artistic works were produced. In terms of musical creation, Nguyen Xuan Khoat's "Bells of the Church" expressed the Catholic compatriots' anger at the invading army's destruction of the church. Van Cao's cantata "Song of the Lo River" praised our country's first great victory in the War of Resistance. Do Nhuan's "Victory at Dien Bien Phu" expressed the excitement of our army and people after achieving victory in this great battle. In addition, many works by musicians such as Luu Huu Phuoc, Van Chung, and Luong Ngoc Trac all showed new progress in the music field. In terms of anti-French resistance literature, there have already been some successful works worthy of recommendation: revolutionary poet To Huu's poetry collection "Viet Bac," the veteran satirical poet Ho Trong Hieu's collection of poems satirizing the enemy "The Smile of the War of Resistance," Nguyen Dinh Thi's novel "The Assault," which reflects the life of combat on the front lines, Nguyen Van Bong's novel "The Water Buffalo," which reflects the fierce struggle in the enemy's rear areas; and To Hoai's work "The Northwest Region," Nguyen Huy Tuong's novel "The Story of A Lu," which reflects the mass movement. Although these literary and artistic works still have some shortcomings, it can be said that these works faithfully reflect the actual face of the Vietnamese people's struggle and production, and portray new heroic figures among the masses. These works all express the Vietnamese people's deep hatred for imperialist aggressors and reactionary feudal forces; they have inspired the patriotic spirit and unyielding will of the Vietnamese nation, enhanced the people's confidence in the Party's leadership, and encouraged people to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and revolution.

    The Vietnamese people have always had a tradition of loving poetry, and the troops and the masses are very fond of antiphonal singing, mountain songs, and folk songs. In the mass struggle, a group of new literary and artistic forces emerged. For example, Comrade Doan Giu, a soldier, created the song "Dedication to the People," which is very popular among the troops and the masses. Hoang Van's "Song of Pulling the Cannon" vividly portrays the image of the People's Army artillery in the Dien Bien Phu campaign. In terms of painting, the newly emerging painter Nguyen Hiem, a fine arts worker in the Southern troops, his works depict all aspects of the resistance in the South. The struggle of the broad masses of farmers to be masters of their own affairs and the upsurge in increasing production have been reflected by the young farmer poet Tran Huu Thung in his poetry collections "Mother's Admonition" and "August Wilderness". In terms of novels, the works of some young writers have attracted people's attention, especially Vu Huy Tam's "Mining Area" and Nguyen Ngoc's "The Countryside Rises Up". Vu Huy Tam was a miner who spent ten years of labor life in the Hong Gai mining area during the French rule and the War of Resistance. This work shows the majestic spirit of the Hong Gai coal miners in labor and struggle, and is the first excellent work depicting the Vietnamese working class. Nguyen Ngoc is a young writer in his twenties who has lived in the Southern troops for a long time. He has gone deep into the fighting life of ethnic minorities and wrote "The Countryside Rises Up," which tells the story of the combat hero Nup. This is a fairly successful work, an epic of heroes, which expresses the patriotic spirit and indomitable will of the entire nation rising up against aggression.

    Due to the vigorous development of literary and artistic activities among the broad masses, some ethnic literature and art that were despised, neglected, and suffocated during the French rule have gradually been restored and are increasingly developing. The most noteworthy are the restoration and development of some classical operas and folk songs and dances. For example, "Chèo" appeared in the north, "Tuồng" appeared in the Fifth Interzone, and Cai Luong was popular in the south. The dances of ethnic minorities such as the Thai, Tho, and Hmong, and the folk song "Quan Ho" in Bac Ninh province are all loved by the masses. Literary and artistic workers also realize that the national heritage left by their ancestors is infinitely rich, so they are seriously accepting and studying these heritages and adapting them to modern needs. Many songs, dances, and dramas with national characteristics have been created, such as the classical opera "Tấm Cám" and "Bamboo Dance" and so on. The Fine Arts Association has been using national forms such as silk painting and oil painting for creation, and is conducting research on folk paintings that have existed for a long time.

    The emergence of the literature and art of various ethnic minorities is an outstanding achievement of Vietnamese War of Resistance literature and art. Due to the Party's implementation of a correct ethnic policy, the ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas have greatly improved their national self-confidence and self-esteem, and various literary and artistic activities have begun to develop in the Thai, Tho, Man, and Tay Nguyen ethnic groups. Some famous dances such as the bamboo pole dance, "Xoe" dance, fan dance, shrimp fishing dance, etc. are all contributions of ethnic minority compatriots in the field of literature and art. In terms of literature, works written in ethnic minority languages ​​have appeared for the first time. Tho poet Nong Quoc Chan has written heroic poems such as "Killing Enemies in Viet Bac" and many other poems of the War of Resistance. Man poet Ban Tai Doan is not only a poet of the Tho and Man ethnic groups, but also a representative figure in the Vietnamese poetry world. The formation of the literature and art of various ethnic groups guarantees the development of the literary and artistic movement in the direction of "letting a hundred flowers bloom".

    The restoration of peace is a huge change in the history of our national struggle, which has created favorable conditions for the development of the Vietnamese people's national literature and art. In 1955, the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers was held. Thousands of artists and performers from 25 ethnic groups in Vietnam participated in this conference. This conference played a major role in further developing Vietnam's national literature and art. After the restoration of peace, literary and artistic activities have increased, and the publication and distribution of literary and artistic works have grown unprecedentedly. The number of books published in just one year after the restoration of peace is equivalent to the total number in the nine years of the War of Resistance. As the material and cultural life of the broad masses of the people gradually improves, their need for spiritual food is also growing. Therefore, an infinitely rich and colorful stage has unfolded in front of the Vietnamese literary and art workers, and requires them to continue to progress.

    The rich experience of the literary and artistic work of various fraternal countries has played an important role in the establishment and development of Vietnam's new literature and art. Especially after the restoration of peace, our cultural exchanges with fraternal countries have greatly developed. Vietnamese literary and art workers delegations who went abroad learned a lot of experience. The visit and performance of art delegations from the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Albania in Vietnam has had a profound impact on the Vietnamese people and literary and art workers. In recent years, many foreign literary and artistic works have been translated into Vietnamese, which has helped the development of Vietnamese literary and artistic work.

    The Vietnam Federation of Literary and Art Associations will convene a National Congress of Literary and Art Workers this year. This conference will analyze the situation of literary and artistic work since the revolution, put forward the tasks of literary and artistic work in the new political environment, and clarify some theoretical issues of literature and art in order to guide literary and artistic creation at this stage. This conference will also expand and strengthen the unity among literary and art workers, encourage the enthusiasm for forging ahead, and bring a new force to the national literary and art workers in order to serve the struggle for unification and the cause of building the North. Actively preparing for this conference is the current important task of Vietnamese literary and art workers. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    越南新文艺的成长
    越南文艺会总书记　阮遵
    自从越南八月革命以来，到现在已经十一年了。在这段不算长的时间里，越南人民已建立起自己的新文艺。这个新文艺继承了民族文艺的优秀传统，并在党和工人阶级的领导下，朝着为人民服务的方向大踏步前进。
    越南文艺界有着光荣的革命斗争的传统。当抗战刚一爆发时，所有的爱国的文艺工作者都离开了城市，到农村去参加反抗侵略的战斗。1948年越南文艺协会成立，当时党的总书记长征同志在他的“马克思主义和越南的文化问题”的报告中，已指出了建立民族的和人民的文艺的基本道路。沿着这条道路前进，越南的文学家和艺术家们曾经在艰难困苦的境况中，用他们的文艺武器参加战斗。他们参加了各个宣传、出版机关的工作，有的参加了部队为战士们服务，有的深入敌占区活动，有的深入到工厂和农村。他们中间有些人在战争中光荣地牺牲了。1953年起，越南北方的大部分文艺工作者都参加了发动群众减租运动，后来又参加了土地改革运动。
    在长期的激烈的民族解放斗争和农村社会改革的斗争中，越南的抗战的文艺工作者逐渐地改造了自己。他们大多数人抛弃了资产阶级的文艺思想，纠正了艺术脱离政治、脱离广大人民的错误观点。
    在轰轰烈烈的人民运动中，产生了许多优秀的文学艺术的作品。在音乐创作方面，阮春括的“教堂的钟声”表现了天主教同胞痛恨侵略军毁坏教堂的愤怒心情。文高的长歌“泸江”歌颂了我国抗战的第一次大胜利。杜润的“奠边府大捷”表现了我国军民在这次轰轰烈烈的大战役取得胜利之后的兴奋情绪。此外，还有如刘友福、文钟、梁玉倬等音乐家的许多作品，都表现出音乐界的新的进展。抗战文学方面，已经有了一些值得推荐的成功作品：革命诗人素友的诗集“越北”，老练的讽刺诗人胡重孝所写的讽刺敌人的诗集“抗战的笑容”，反映前线战斗生活的阮廷诗的小说“冲击”，反映敌后地区剧烈斗争的阮文俸的小说“水牛”；还有苏怀的作品“西北地区”，反映发动群众运动的阮辉想的小说“阿陆的故事”等等。这些文艺家的作品，虽然还存在着一些缺点，但可以说，这些作品都忠实地反映了越南人民的战斗和生产的实际面貌，刻划了群众中的新的英雄人物。这些作品都表现了越南人民对帝国主义侵略者和反动封建势力的深刻的仇恨；它们鼓舞了越南民族的爱国精神和不屈的意志，提高了人民群众对党的领导的信心，鼓舞着人们去争取抗战和革命的胜利。
    越南人民本来就有着爱好诗歌的传统，部队和群众都十分喜爱对答地和唱山歌和民谣。在群众斗争中，还涌现出来了一批新的文艺生力军。例如尹光凯同志，他是一个军人，他创作的“为人民献身”这首歌曲，在部队和群众中十分流行。黄云创作的“拉炮之歌”鲜明地表现了奠边府战役中人民军炮兵的形象。在绘画方面，新起的画家阮险，是南方部队中的美术工作者，他的作品表现了南部抗战中的各方面形态。广大农民争取当家作主的斗争和增加生产的热潮，已经被年青的农民诗人陈友椿反映在他的诗集“母亲的叮咛”和“八月的原野”里面。在小说方面，一些年青作家的作品已引起人们的注意，特别突出的是武辉心的“矿区”和阮玉的“江山站起来了”。武辉心是一个矿工，在法国统治时期和抗战时期，他在鸿基矿区度过了十年的劳动生活。这部作品表现了鸿基煤矿工人在劳动和斗争中的雄伟气魄，是描写越南工人阶级的第一部优秀作品。阮玉是一位长期生活在南方部队中、才二十多岁的青年作家，他曾深入到少数民族的战斗生活中，并写出了“江山站起来了”这部作品，叙述战斗英雄努巴的故事。这是一部相当成功的作品，是一首英雄的史诗，它表现出整个民族奋起反抗侵略的爱国精神和倔强意志。
    由于文艺活动在广大群众中大力开展，一些在法国统治时期备受蔑视、冷淡和窒息的民族文艺也逐渐得到恢复，并日益发展起来。最值得注意的是一些古典歌剧和民间歌舞的恢复和发展。例如“棹曲”出现在北部，“部戏”出现在第五联区，改良戏则流行在南部。泰、土、苗等少数民族的舞蹈和北宁省等地的民歌“官贺”，都受到群众的热爱。文艺家们也认识到自己祖先留下的民族遗产是无限丰富的，因此他们正严肃地接受和研究这些遗产，并使它们适应于现代需要。许多带有民族色彩的歌曲、舞蹈和戏剧等已被创作出来，如古典戏“沁姐和田哥”，以及“竹丛舞”等等。美术家协会方面已在利用绸画和油画等民族形式进行创作，并对许久以来存在的民间画进行研究。
    各少数民族文艺的出现，是越南抗战文艺的一个突出的成就。由于党执行了正确的民族政策，山区各少数民族大大地提高了民族自信心和自尊心，各种文艺活动也开始在泰、土、僈、西原……等民族当中得到初步发展。一些有名的舞蹈如竹丛舞、“舒”舞、扇舞、淘虾舞等等，都是少数民族同胞在文艺方面的贡献。文学方面，已经第一次出现了用少数民族文字写成的作品。土族诗人侬国振，就写出了歌颂英雄的诗篇“越北杀敌”和其他许多抗战诗篇。僈族诗人磐才团，他不仅是土族和僈族的诗人，而且也是越南诗歌界的代表人物。各民族文艺的形成，保证了文艺运动向“百花齐放”的方向发展。
    和平恢复是我国民族斗争历史上的一个巨大的转变，它为越南人民的民族文艺的发展创造了有利条件。1955年举行了全国文艺工作者大会。参加这次大会的有越南二十五个民族的成千个艺术家和艺人。这个大会对于进一步发展越南的民族文艺起了重大的推动作用。和平恢复以后，文艺活动增多了，文艺作品的出版发行数更是空前增长。仅仅在和平恢复后的一年内所发行的书籍册数就相当于抗战九年内的总数。由于广大人民的物质和文化生活逐步提高，他们对精神食粮的需要也就日益增长。因此在越南文艺工作者的面前已经展开了一个无限丰富多采的阶段，并且要求他们不断进步。
    各兄弟国家文学艺术工作的丰富经验，对于越南新文艺的建立和发展起了重要的作用。特别是和平恢复后，我国同兄弟国家的文化交流大大地发展了。到国外去的越南文艺工作者代表团学习了许多经验。苏联、中国、朝鲜和阿尔巴尼亚等国艺术代表团在越南的访问演出，在越南人民和文艺工作者中发生了深刻的影响。近年来，许多外国文艺作品译成越文，这些都有助于越南文艺工作的发展。
    越南文艺工作者协会将在今年内召开全国文艺工作者大会。这个大会将分析自革命至今的文艺工作情况，提出在新的政治环境中文艺工作的任务，明确若干文艺理论方面的问题，以便指导现阶段的文艺创作。这个大会还将扩大和增强文艺工作者之间的团结，鼓舞奋勇前进的热情，并为全国文艺工作者带来一股新的力量，以便为争取统一的斗争和建设北方的事业服务。积极地准备开好这个大会，是越南文艺工作者当前的重要任务。（本报特约稿）
