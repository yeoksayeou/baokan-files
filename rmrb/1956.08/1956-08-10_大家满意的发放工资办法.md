Xinhua News Agency report:

    A "three-way satisfaction" wage distribution method has been implemented in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province. This method involves scheduling the wage distribution times of various units, distributing wages twice a month at different times, so that there are units and employees receiving wages every day.

    Since the county implemented this wage distribution method in January of this year, the first to feel satisfied were the employees living in the county seat. They no longer had to queue up at the grain supply department to buy grain as soon as they received their wages, as they did in the past. The queuing and congestion for grain purchases has been eliminated because employees buy grain at different times due to the staggered wage distribution.

    Another group feeling satisfied are the cadres in the finance and banking departments. Because the county's Party and government financial income is limited, there were often instances of expenditures exceeding income when wages were distributed centrally in the past. This situation has been eliminated since the implementation of staggered wage distribution. In the bank, the new wage distribution method has brought about a more balanced distribution of paper money in the market, and the excessive busyness and overtime work of staff during centralized wage distribution has also been overcome.

    Also satisfied with this wage distribution method are the commercial departments. In the past, at the six grain supply outlets in the county seat, long queues of people buying grain would form in front of the doors whenever wages were distributed, lasting at least three to five days each time. Sales staff worked overtime but could not meet the needs of customers. On weekdays, some sales staff were almost idle. Since the implementation of the new staggered wage distribution method, the daily sales volume has been relatively balanced, with no crowding for buyers and no excessive busyness for sellers. The same elimination of alternating periods of slack and busy has occurred in department stores.

    大家满意的发放工资办法
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省讷河县推行了一种“三头满意”的工资发放办法。这个办法是把各单位职工的工资发放时间加以排队，分别在不同的时间里每月分两次发放，每一天里都有领到工资的单位和职工。
    这个县从今年一月推行这种工资发放办法以后，首先感到满意的是住在县城的职工。他们已经不像以前那样每逢工资拿到手里，都要到粮食供应部门站队买粮；由于职工买粮时间因分期发放工资而错开，买粮的排队拥挤现象消除了。
    另一个感到满意的是财政、金融部门的干部。因为县的党政机关财政收入有限，过去集中发放工资，时有入不敷出的情况发生。分期发放工资以后，这种情况就没有了。在银行里，新的工资发放办法带来了市场纸币投放的均衡，工作人员在集中发放工资时那种过分忙碌和加班加点的现象也克服了。
    对这种工资发放办法感到满意的还有商业部门。过去，在县城的六个粮食供应门市部里，每当发放工资时，门前站着买粮的长长队伍，每次至少要延续三、五天，营业人员加班加点也满足不了顾客的要求；而在平日里，有些营业员几乎无事可做。实行新的分期工资发放办法以后，每天的营业量比较平衡，买的人不挤，卖的人也不很忙。在百货商店里，也同样消灭了时松时紧现象。
