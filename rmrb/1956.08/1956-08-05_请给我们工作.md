    Please Give Us Work
    I graduated from the typing department of Beijing No. 2 School for the Deaf and Dumb in the summer of 1954. After graduation, the principal and the Department for the Deaf and Dumb of the Ministry of Education told us to go home first, and when there were suitable jobs, they would introduce us. I have been waiting in Shanghai for two years, but there is still no news of a job. I once went to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and the reply I received was to "wait patiently." I then requested help from the Jiangning District Government of Shanghai, and they said that since I graduated from a school in Beijing, my employment issues should be resolved by Beijing. However, when I wrote to the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, they said that since I live in Shanghai, it would be more convenient for Shanghai to resolve the issue.
    The state has spent money to train some useless deaf and dumb people into people with working abilities. The purpose is to allow us to do something for the people as well. I hope the relevant departments will quickly resolve my employment issue.

    请给我们工作
    我是1954年夏天从北京第二聋哑学校打字科毕业的，我们一班同学毕业后，校长和教育部聋哑处告诉我们，先回家去，等到有了合适的工作时，再给我们介绍。我在上海等待了两年，工作还是渺无音讯。我曾经找过上海市人民政府，得到的答复是，要我“耐心等待”，我又去请求上海市江宁区政府，他们又说：我是从北京的学校毕业的，职业问题应由北京解决。但是，我写信请求北京市教育局时，他们说：我住在上海，还是由上海解决比较方便。
    国家花费了金钱把我们一些无用的聋哑人培养成了有工作能力的人，目的就是为了让我们也能为人民做一点事情，希望有关部门，赶快为我解决工作问题。　　许子华
