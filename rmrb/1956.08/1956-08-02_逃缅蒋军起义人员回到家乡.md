Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 1st. Former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who fled to Burma and participated in the uprising, including Li Zhaosheng, returned to their hometown of Gengma County, Yunnan Province in late July. Family members who had been looking forward to reuniting with their loved ones for many years joyfully welcomed them into their homes.

Along the way from Kunming to their hometown, Li Zhaosheng and others were welcomed by people from all ethnic groups. Upon arriving in Gengma, the local people held a welcoming rally. Song Enhua, a member of the masses who attended the welcoming rally, said with emotion: Seeing Li Zhaosheng and others safely arrive in their hometown and receive such good and lenient treatment from the government, he especially missed his brothers who were still abroad. He hoped that his brothers would also return home soon for a reunion.
