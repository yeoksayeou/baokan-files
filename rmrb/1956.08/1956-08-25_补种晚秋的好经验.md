Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 24th: Farmers in the Xinyang Special District in the upper reaches of the Huai River have, in the past ten-odd days, replanted late autumn crops on two million mu of the two and a half million mu of farmland that was flooded and needed replanting.

In some low-lying areas of this special district, about two million mu of farmland are flooded every year and require multiple replantings. This year, these low-lying areas have suffered multiple disasters, and replanting has been carried out three to four times.

The crops that have been rushed to plant in this area are all suitable for the current season. For example, mung beans and late sweet potatoes are being planted in large quantities recently, and cold millet, buckwheat, and radishes and cabbages are being sown in large quantities currently. In particular, cold millet can still grow in colder climates.

Farmers in this area have accumulated many experiences and methods for preserving seedlings and promoting seedling growth during rush planting and replanting. For example, the "seed dipping" method adopted by farmers in Huaibin County involves scattering seeds in the field when the water has receded to only cover the surface, and then dragging a broom or branch over them so that the seeds enter the mud. By the time the water recedes, the seeds have already germinated and emerged. This method can advance the planting time, and the seedlings can emerge completely. In areas where the water recedes quickly, the "spot planting" method is used, where seeds and quick-acting fertilizer are buried together in the soil. The fertilizer promotes seedling growth, which can promote vigorous seedling growth.

Farmers in Xinyang Special District use intercropping for rushed planting, such as intercropping mung beans and cold millet, buckwheat and rapeseed, and buckwheat and other vegetables. This intercropping method can ensure that if one crop suffers from a sudden climate change, another crop can still be harvested.

To solve the shortage of labor and livestock during the rush planting season, farmers in this area have universally promoted mutual support and exchange labor between neighboring townships and cooperatives.

    补种晚秋的好经验
    据新华社郑州24日电　淮河上游的信阳专区农民，在最近的十多天时间内，已经将水淹需要重种和补种的二百五十多万亩农田，补种上二百万亩晚秋作物。
    这个专区部分地区地势低洼，每年约有二百多万亩农田受涝而需多次重种。今年这些低洼地区因多次受灾，已经进行了三次到四次的补种。
    这一地区在抢种的作物中，都是适宜于当前季节生长的。如最近大量种植的绿豆、晚红薯和当前正大量播种的寒粟、荞麦和萝卜、白菜等。特别是寒粟，在较冷的气候下仍能生长。
    这个地区农民在抢种补种时，积累了许多保苗和催苗生长的经验和办法。如淮滨县农民采取的“沾种”，便是在水退得只盖住地皮时，把种籽撒在田里，用扫帚或树枝在上面拉过一遍，种籽便进入泥中；等水下去后，那时，种籽早已发芽出土了。这种办法能够使播种的时间提前，苗子也能出齐全。在水退得快的地方采用“点种”，用种籽和速效肥料一起挖土种下，肥料催苗生长，可以促使苗芽旺盛地生长。
    信阳专区农民在抢种的耕作上都采用混作，如绿豆和寒粟混作、荞麦和油菜混作。荞麦和其他蔬菜混作等。这种混作的方法，可以在气候突变的情况下，一种作物受灾时能多获得另一种作物的收成。
    为解决抢种时节劳畜力的不足，这一地区农民普遍推行了邻乡、邻社互相支援、换工的办法。
