Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd. Zhuzhou City in Hunan Province is speeding up basic construction through increased collaboration between basic construction units. From April to now, the units have mutually adjusted and borrowed over two hundred tons of various building materials such as steel and cement, enabling the timely commencement of seven projects and avoiding losses from mid-project stoppages and waiting for materials.

Currently, two larger construction companies and five specialized construction and installation teams in the Zhuzhou area are working intensively on basic construction projects. In the past, there was little collaboration between basic construction units. Starting in April this year, the Zhuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized mutual collaboration and the adjustment of construction materials between units through various meetings. For example, one unit was short of over one hundred types of building materials with specific specifications, and through mutual adjustment among the units, more than seventy types were resolved, ensuring the progress of this unit's project.

Through collaboration, not only has the progress of basic construction been accelerated, but also basic construction investment has been saved for the state. Two factories, through collaboration meetings, canceled their original separate plans and jointly built water pipes, estimating a saving of more than 1.3 million yuan in investment. Three construction units, including the Zhuzhou Chemical Plant and the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, fully considered the principle of mutual utilization of by-products when arranging the factory production area, reducing a production workshop for the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant and estimating a saving of more than 12 million yuan in investment.

    株州各基本建设单位加强协作
    七项工程及时开工，避免了中途停工待料的损失
    新华社长沙3日电　湖南省株州市各基本建设单位互相协作，加快基本建设进度。从四月份到现在，各单位互相调剂、借用的各种钢、钢材、水泥等建筑材料达两百多吨，使七项工程及时开了工，并且避免了中途停工待料的损失。
    现在，株州地区有两个较大的建筑公司和五个专业性的建筑安装队在紧张地进行基本建设工作。过去，基本建设单位间很少协作。从今年四月份起，中共株州市委员会即通过各种会议，组织各单位间互相协作，调剂建筑材料。例如有一个单位曾缺少有一定规格要求的建筑材料一百多种，经过各单位间的互相调剂，就解决了七十多种。保证了这个单位的工程进度。
    通过协作，不仅加快了基本建设进度，而且为国家节约了基本建设投资。有两个工厂通过协作会议，取消了原来各搞一套的计划，联合建筑自来水管，估计可以节约投资一百三十多万元。株州化工厂、磷肥厂等三个建设单位，在布置工厂生产区的时候，充分考虑了互相利用副产品的原则，使磷肥厂减少了一个生产车间，估计可以节约投资一千二百多万元。
