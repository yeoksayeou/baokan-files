New Products

    Instrument for Inspecting Machinery
    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant recently successfully trial-produced a new type of gear integrated inspection instrument that can automatically record the meshing of gears. This instrument was manufactured by imitating new Soviet products. Using this instrument, the quality of mechanical gears of various shapes such as cylindrical, umbrella, and turbine shapes can be inspected. Placing the gear on this instrument for inspection can not only allow observation of the slightest deviations in the mutual meshing of two mechanical gears on the instrument's meter, but also allow the instrument's automatic recorder's ink stylus to accurately draw the size of the gear meshing deviation magnified one hundred times on the paper cylinder simultaneously. With this precise record, factory laboratory personnel can use it as data to study and improve product quality. Therefore, this instrument plays a significant role in improving the quality of gears.

      Advanced Welding Rods
    Seven types of Soviet-style advanced welding rods used for welding metal structures, ships, bridges, and boilers have been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Joint State-Private Bin Cheng Welding Material Manufacturing Plant. The trial production of these seven types of welding rods began in September of last year, and four of them have been put into production successively in the last three months.
    These seven types of welding rods can be used to weld several different kinds of workpieces. Among them, one type of welding rod can withstand a tensile force of 49 kilograms per square millimeter of the welded surface. It can withstand an impact force of 14 kilograms per square centimeter of the welded surface; X-ray fluoroscopy of the weld shows that there are very few pores inside.
    These Soviet-style welding rods are all made of domestic materials. The cost of the four types of welding rods currently in production is 20% to 50% lower than that of imported goods.

    Multi-Layer High-Pressure Vessel
    The multi-layer high-pressure vessel trial-produced by the Nanjing Yongli Ning Factory successfully underwent a burst test at the end of July. When the vessel was injected with a pressure of 1,200 kilograms, it was intact and undamaged, withstanding a pressure exceeding 3.7 times the design requirements.
    Multi-layer high-pressure vessels are indispensable equipment in the chemical and petroleum industries. In the past, this equipment was all imported from foreign countries, with high prices and difficulty in purchasing. The successful burst test will lay the technical foundation for our country to formally manufacture various multi-layer high-pressure vessels, enabling our country to realize a complete set of self-made synthetic ammonia equipment as soon as possible.

    Radio Meteorological Balloon
    The Rubber Industry Science Institute recently successfully trial-produced a No. 100 radio meteorological balloon. This balloon is one of the main tools for high-altitude meteorological exploration work, and in the past, it has always relied on imports.
    The trial-produced radio meteorological balloon has undergone mechanical and physical performance testing, and has been sent to the Central Meteorological Observatory several times for release and appraisal, proving that its performance is good, and its lifting height and general performance meet the requirements for use.

    Sodium Morrhuate Injection
    Sodium morrhuate injection is a medicine for treating vascular diseases, and in the past, it all relied on foreign imports. Now, the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company Fish Liver Oil Factory has produced this medicine.
    According to foreign products and medical books, sodium morrhuate is made from cod as a raw material. The Shanghai Aquatic Products Company Fish Liver Oil Factory used various fish along the coast of our country as raw material for experiments, and found that products made from ray fish as a raw material have good medical effects. The output of ray fish is very large along the coast of our country, which provides favorable conditions for expanding the production of sodium morrhuate and reducing product costs.
    Clinical trials have proved that domestic sodium morrhuate has good therapeutic effects for diseases such as "hemangioma," "internal hemorrhoids," "varicose veins of the lower extremities," and "hydrocele." (Liu Manhua)
  Opaque Wool Nylon Socks
    Opaque wool nylon socks are a new product recently trial-produced in Shanghai and will be on sale in the fourth quarter. These nylon socks are woven with wool and nylon, and they are softer and tougher than ordinary socks, and more durable than glass silk stockings. These socks are elastic and can stretch with the size of the foot. If a person has two pairs of nylon socks, they can wear them for a year.

    新产品
    检验机械的仪器
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂最近试制成功了一种能自动记录校验齿轮啮合情况的新型齿轮综合检查仪。这个仪器是仿照苏联新产品制造出来的。使用这种仪器，可以检验圆柱形、伞形、涡轮形等各种形状的机械齿轮的质量情况。把齿轮放在这台仪器上检验，不但能在仪器的仪表上观察出两个机械齿轮互相啮合时的最微小的偏差，而且仪器的自动记录器的墨水铁笔，还可以同时在纸筒上正确地画出放大一百倍的齿轮啮合偏差的尺寸。有了这种精确的记录，工厂实验室人员就可以作为资料来研究改进产品的质量。因此，这种仪器对于提高齿轮的质量有重大作用。　（新华社讯）
      高级电焊条
    七种用来焊接金属结构、船舶、桥梁和锅炉的苏联式高级电焊条，已经在上海公私合营斌诚电焊材料制造厂试制成功。这七种电焊条是从去年九月开始试制的，其中有四种在最近三个多月里陆续投入了生产。
    这七种电焊条，可以用来焊接好些种不同的工作物。其中有一种电焊条焊接的每一平方公厘的焊接面上，可以承受四十九公斤的拉力。每一平方公分的焊接面上，可以承受十四公斤的冲击力；用X光透视焊缝，里面很少有气孔。
    这些苏联式电焊条，都是用国产材料制成的。现在生产的四种焊条，成本比进口货低20％到50％。

    多层式高压容器
    南京永利宁厂试制的多层式高压容器，七月底曾成功地进行了爆破试验。当容器内部注入一千二百公斤压力后，完整无损，能承受的压力超过了设计要求的三点七倍。
    多层式高压容器是化学、石油工业中不可缺少的设备。这种设备过去都靠国外进口，价格昂贵而且不容易购到。这次爆破试验成功，将为我国正式自制各种多层式高压容器奠定技术基础，使我国自制合成氨全套设备能够早日实现。

    无线电探空气球
    橡胶工业科学研究所最近试制成功一种第100号无线电探空气球。这种气球是高空气象探测工作的主要工具之一，过去一直依靠国外进口。
    试制成功的无线电探空气球，经机械物理性能检验，并数次送中央气象台进行施放鉴定，证明性能良好，升空高度及一般性能都符合使用要求。　（据新华社讯）
    鱼肝油酸钠注射液
    鱼肝油酸钠注射液是医治血管疾病的药品，过去全靠国外进口。现在，上海水产公司鱼肝油厂制成了这种药品。
    按照国外产品和医药书籍，鱼肝油酸钠是用鳕鱼做原料的。上海水产公司鱼肝油厂用我国沿海各种鱼类作原料试验，发现鳐鱼做原料的制品有良好的医疗效果。鳐鱼在我国沿海产量很大，这对扩大鱼肝油酸钠的生产和降低产品成本提供了有利条件。
    国产鱼肝油酸钠经临床试验证明，对于“血管瘤”“内痔”“下肢静脉曲张”“鞘膜积水”等病的医治都有良好的效果。（刘曼华）
