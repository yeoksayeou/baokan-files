Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. Enshi Prefecture, Hubei Province, is carrying out diverse production activities to reap more harvests, striving for an increase of 130 million jin of grain throughout the region.

After the CPC Enshi Prefectural Committee issued instructions at the end of July to vigorously carry out the "diverse production and more harvest" campaign, agricultural cooperatives in various regions formulated diverse production plans based on their specific circumstances. According to statistics from 2,003 cooperatives in four counties, including Enshi and Badong, plans are in place to plant more than 652,000 mu of crops such as potatoes, late sweet potatoes, and buckwheat. After the plans are realized, each agricultural cooperative can increase production by an average of 10% to 20%. In carrying out the "diverse production and more harvest" campaign, all regions paid attention to solving specific problems such as shortages of seeds and fertilizers. The Eighth District of Enshi County adopted three methods to solve the seed shortage: exchanging goods for goods, mutual adjustment between townships and cooperatives, and procurement and supply by the grain management departments. Gaoping District of Jianshi County launched a crash fertilizer accumulation campaign during the "diverse production and more harvest" period, accumulating 290,000 dan in four days. The 116 agricultural cooperatives in the First District of Badong County made various preparations before the rain and went all out after the rain, sowing buckwheat and planting sweet potatoes on more than 1,700 mu in one day. Currently, 14.5% of the more than 80,000 mu of diverse production plans in Badong County have been completed. The Dengta Cooperative of Wufeng Township in Enshi County has completed its plan to interplant 200 mu of sweet potatoes.

    湖北省恩施专区
    开展多种多收生产活动
    新华社武汉16日电　湖北省恩施专区开展多种多收生产活动，争取全区增产一亿三千万斤粮食。
    中共恩施地委在七月底发出大力开展多种多收运动的指示后，各地农业社根据不同情况普遍定出了多种多收计划。据恩施、巴东等四个县二千零三个社统计，计划多种洋芋、晚红薯、荞麦等作物六十五万二千多亩，计划实现后，平均每个农业社可增产一成到两成。在开展多种多收运动中，各地都注意解决了缺种籽、缺肥料等具体问题。恩施县第八区采取以实物换实物，乡、社间互相调剂和粮食管理部门组织收购供应三个办法，解决了缺种困难。建始县高坪区在多种多收中突击积肥，四天中积了二十九万担。巴东县第一区一百一十六个农业社雨前作好了多种准备，雨后全力以赴，一天就播种荞麦、栽红薯等作物一千七百多亩。现在巴东全县八万多亩多种计划已经完成14.5％。恩施县五峰乡灯塔社套种二百亩红薯的计划已全部完成。
