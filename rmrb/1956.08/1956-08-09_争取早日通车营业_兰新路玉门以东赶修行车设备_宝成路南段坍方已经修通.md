Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 8th: Along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway east of Yumen, where the tracks have already been laid, the construction of various operating facilities is being accelerated to strive for early opening to traffic.

Along the more than 110-kilometer section from Qingshui to Yumen East Station, newly painted milestone markers and station name signs have all been erected; conspicuous advance notice signs for entering the station have also been set up where trains enter the station. Temporary coal and water supply facilities along the railway line have recently been repaired. At Yumen East Station, track workers have already laid dedicated lines for loading and unloading goods and seven tracks, and the triangle line for turning locomotives has also been repaired. At Qingshui Station, facilities such as ash pits and inspection pits are being built at an accelerated pace.

Currently, thousands of construction workers on the Gobi Desert are building the houses for more than a dozen stations. It is estimated that within this quarter, over 20,000 square meters of ticket offices, waiting rooms, station offices, gatehouses, and road maintenance team buildings will be completed.

After maintenance and improvement of the line quality on the section east of Yumen, material trains can now safely pass at a speed of about 30 kilometers per hour. Soon, after the completion of various traffic facilities, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can be officially opened to traffic to Yumen.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 8th: The section of the Baocheng Railway south of the junction point, from Guangyuan, Sichuan, to Huangsha River, Gansu, where more than 300 landslides blocked the line for more than two months, has been repaired after round-the-clock efforts by 30,000 staff and workers.

A train from Baoji to Chengdu has already passed through this 200-plus kilometer section of landslide-affected line. After unloading goods along the line, it arrived safely in Chengdu at the end of last month.

Currently, the landslide treatment committee, composed of three deputy chief engineers from the Second Engineering Bureau, the Second Construction Branch Bureau, and the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways' New Railway Construction General Bureau, is directing the accelerated permanent cure of the hidden dangers in this section on the construction site.

    新华社兰州8日电　兰新铁路玉门以东已经铺好轨的线路，正在加紧修筑各项行车设备，争取早日通车营业。
    从清水至玉门东站一百一十多公里的沿线，新漆好的里程碑和站名牌，已经全部树立起来；列车进站的地方，也已经树好了醒目的进站预告牌。铁路沿线的临时给煤、给水设备，最近都修好了。在玉门东站上，钉道工人已经铺好了装卸货物用的专用线和七股股道，机车转头用的三角线也修好了。清水车站上的灰坑、检查坑等设备正在加紧修筑中。
    目前，戈壁滩上有数千个建筑工人正在修筑十多个车站的房屋建筑，预计在这个季度之内，将有两万平方公尺以上的票房、候车室、车站办公室、闸房、养路工区的房屋建筑完工。
    玉门以东的线路经过维修和改善线路质量以后，材料列车现在已经能以每小时三十公里左右的速度安全通过；不久，各项通车设备完工以后，兰新铁路就可以正式通车到玉门了。
    新华社成都8日电　宝成铁路接轨点以南从四川广元到甘肃黄沙河一段，阻塞了两个多月的三百多处坍方经过三万名职工日夜抢修以后，已经修通。
    从宝鸡开往成都方向的一趟列车已经通过了这一段二百多公里的坍方线路，在沿线卸下了货物以后，于上月底平安到达成都。
    现在，由铁道部新建铁路总局第二工程局、第二基建分局和第二设计院三个副总工程师组成的坍方处理委员会，正在工地上指挥加紧根治这一段的病害工程。
