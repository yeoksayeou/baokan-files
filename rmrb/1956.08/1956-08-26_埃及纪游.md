Travels in Egypt

    (10) "Gambling Palace" and "Escape Palace"

    Alexandria used to be Farouk's summer retreat. Every summer, if he didn't travel to Europe, he would spend six months of the summer here and then return to Cairo. The two palaces are at opposite ends of Alexandria. The Western Palace is Ras el-Tin Palace, and the Eastern Palace is Montaza Palace.

    Montaza Palace was actually a gambling palace. This was where Farouk and his subordinates gathered to gamble. Various gambling tools such as roulette are still on display in the palace. Ras el-Tin Palace is a magnificent palace built in 1836 during the reign of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The luxurious furnishings inside the palace are like those of Abdin Palace in Cairo, but Farouk remodeled the palace to make it more modern. There are large elevators with the letter "F" (Farouk) engraved on the doors. Tracks were laid inside the palace, leading directly to the main railway line outside the palace. A pier was set up in the seaside garden so that Farouk could board a boat directly from the palace to the Mediterranean.

    On July 23, 1952, when the Egyptian army launched an uprising in Cairo, Farouk and his subordinates were gambling in Alexandria.

    The Egyptian army issued an ultimatum to Farouk, ordering him to sign the abdication document before noon on July 26, 1952, and leave Egyptian territory before 6:00 p.m. that day. The army's ultimatum read:

    "Because of your (referring to Farouk) licentiousness and violation of the constitution, and because of your indifference to the suffering of the people, the country has fallen into a state of unrest, so that no one can feel safe in their life, property, and reputation.

    "Because you are stubborn and unrepentant, so that traitors and bribe-takers can obtain protection and security under your shadow, and use the poverty and hunger of the people to exchange for your huge wealth and shameless luxury, you have damaged the honor of Egypt in the eyes of the people of the world…"

    This is the Egyptian people's solemn accusation against Farouk's feudal dynasty.

    In a hall of Ras el-Tin Palace, we saw a pavilion composed of eight marble columns, under which there was a round table, which was where Farouk signed the abdication document. After signing, Farouk changed into his naval uniform and walked out of the palace with heavy steps at 5:30 p.m., boarded the speedboat at the seaside pier he had prepared, and fled to Rome under the cover of the then US Ambassador to Egypt.

    埃及纪游

    （十）“赌宫”和“逃宫”
    亚历山大过去是法鲁克避暑的地方。每年夏天，要是不到欧洲去旅行，他便到这里来度过六个月的暑天，然后再回开罗。两个皇宫在亚历山大市的两头。西宫是拉萨尔丁宫，东宫是蒙塔查宫。
    蒙塔查宫实际上是赌宫。这是法鲁克和他的臣属聚赌的地方。现在宫里还陈列着“轮盘”等各种赌具。拉萨尔丁宫是个富丽堂皇的行宫，建于1836年埃及穆罕默德·阿里皇朝。宫内的豪华的陈设一如开罗阿勃丁宫，但法鲁克把这个宫改装得更加近代化了。那里有着宽大的电梯，门上刻着“F”（法鲁克）的大字。宫内铺着铁轨，直通宫外的主要铁路干线。滨海的花园里设立了一个码头，以便法鲁克在宫内登船直下地中海。
    1952年7月23日，埃及军队在开罗举行起义时，法鲁克和他的臣属正在亚历山大聚赌。
    埃及军队向法鲁克提出了最后通牒，限令他在1952年7月26日中午前签署退位书，并在当天下午六时前，离开埃及国土。军队的最后通牒写道：
    “由于你（指法鲁克）荒淫无道和违犯宪法，由于你对人民疾苦的漠不关心，全国已陷于纷扰不安状态，以致任何人都不能感到其生命、财产和名誉的安全。
    “由于你执迷不悟，以致奸细和受贿者在你的影子下获得庇护和安全，并以人民的贫穷和饥饿来换取你们巨大的财富和无耻的奢华生活，你在全世界人民面前已经损害了埃及的荣誉……。”
    这是埃及人民对法鲁克封建皇朝的严正控诉。
    在拉萨尔丁宫的一个大厅里，我们看到有八根大理石圆柱组成的一个亭子，亭下有一圆桌，这就是法鲁克签署退位书的地方。签署完毕后，法鲁克换上了他的海军服，在下午五时半钟，拖着沉重的步子走出皇宫，就在这个他自己准备好了的滨海码头登上快艇，在当时的美国驻埃及大使掩护下逃往罗马去了。（附图片）
