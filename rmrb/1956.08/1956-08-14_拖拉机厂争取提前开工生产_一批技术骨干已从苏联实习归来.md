	Tractor Factory Strives for Early Start of Production
	A Group of Technical Personnel Return from Internship in the Soviet Union

	This newspaper reports that fourteen workshops of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant will be put into production this year. Some equipment for the auxiliary workshops, such as the tool and die, repair, electrical repair, and non-standard equipment workshops, has already arrived at the construction site. The cranes and transport equipment needed for installation have entered the site, and the installation preparation work is ready. The formal installation of equipment will begin this month.

	The construction progress of these workshops to be put into production this year is one year ahead of the original plan. The factories manufacturing tools for these workshops are also strongly supporting this requirement. The Shanghai Tool Factory actively manufactured more than 15,000 tools for the tractor factory despite having a full workload and a shortage of materials. When the staff of the Tianjin Tool Supply Station heard that the tractor factory needed a large number of tools, they proactively contacted Luoyang to manufacture more than 2,000 cutting tools, drill bits, and other tools that had not been commissioned out to the tractor factory.

	Among the eleven main factory buildings of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, seven have completed civil engineering and exterior construction. These factory buildings were built in half a year under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Alekseyev, using rapid construction methods. The exterior construction of the engine workshop, with an area of more than 20,000 square meters, would normally take three months to complete, but it only took thirty-eight working days here; the fuel system workshop, which recently completed the integrated hoisting of factory building components, further shortened the construction period to thirty-two and a half days.

	During the construction of these workshops, the workers used a series of the world's most advanced work methods, such as parallel flow operations, cross-construction, and integrated hoisting, and promoted advanced experiences such as mechanical surface compaction and dry-hard concrete. The construction workers, who have mastered rich experience in rapid construction, will more skillfully build the tractor workshop, standard metal parts workshop, steel casting and iron casting workshops, which will be built successively in the future, and strive to produce tractors for farmers ahead of schedule.

	Furthermore, a group of technical personnel from the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant who were interning at the Kharkov Tractor Plant in the Soviet Union have completed their internship and returned to China. There are sixteen of them in total, all of whom went abroad in June last year.

	Before they even arrived in the Soviet Union, the person in charge of the Kharkov Tractor Plant prepared an internship plan for them. After they arrived, the factory designated technically skilled cadres and workers to specifically assist them. Liu Yuchun's teacher, who was interning in the cold stamping die workshop, was Lubankin, a nationally famous advanced producer in the Soviet Union. Lubankin was the first to teach Liu Yuchun three newly created advanced operating methods.

	This group of technical personnel who have returned to the factory have been assigned to various workshops as workshop directors, technical section chiefs, and engineers. They will participate in the work of the first batch of workshops to be put into production this year and carry out production preparations for the second batch of workshops to be put into production.

### 拖拉机厂争取提前开工生产  一批技术骨干已从苏联实习归来

    拖拉机厂争取提前开工生产
    一批技术骨干已从苏联实习归来
    本报讯　第一拖拉机制造厂今年将有十四个车间投入生产。辅助工场的工具冲模、机修、电修、非标准设备等车间的部分设备已经到达工地，安装需用的起重机和运输机具都已经进入现场，安装准备工作已经就绪，这个月内就要正式开始安装设备。
    今年要投入生产的这批车间，施工进度比原定计划提前了一年。为这些车间承制工具的工厂，也都根据这个要求大力支援。上海工具厂在任务满、材料缺的情况下，仍然主动地为拖拉机厂承制了一万五千多件工具。天津工具供应站的职工，听说拖拉机厂需要大批工具，就主动到洛阳联系，为拖拉机厂承制了没有委托出去的两千多件刨刀、钻头等工具。
    第一拖拉机制造厂的十一个主厂房中，已经有七个完成了土木建筑工程和外型工程。这些厂房都是在苏联专家阿力克谢也夫同志的指导下，采用快速施工方法，在半年内建成的。面积两万多平方公尺的发动机工场的外型工程，通常要用三个月才能完成，这里只花了三十八个工作日；最近才完成厂房构件综合吊装的燃料系统工场，更把工期缩短到三十二天半。
    在这些工场的施工过程中，工人们运用了平行流水作业、交叉施工、综合吊装等一系列世界上最先进的工作法，推广了机械表面夯实，干硬性混凝土等先进经验。掌握了丰富的快速施工经验的建筑工人们，将更加熟练地修建今后将陆续开始建筑的拖拉机工场、标准金属零件工场、铸钢和铸铁工场，争取提前为农民生产出拖拉机。
    又讯　第一拖拉机制造厂在苏联哈尔科夫拖拉机厂实习的一批技术骨干，已经实习完毕回国来了。他们共有十六个人，都是去年六月间出国的。
    当他们还没有到达苏联以前，哈尔科夫拖拉机厂的负责人就为他们作好了实习计划；他们到达以后，厂里指定技术较高的干部和工人具体帮助他们。在冷冲模车间实习的刘玉春的老师，就是苏联全国著名的先进生产者鲁半金。鲁半金曾经将自己新创造的三种先进的操作方法，最先传授给刘玉春。
    回厂的这批技术骨干，已经分别到各工场担任车间主任、技术科长、机械师等职务。他们将参加今年第一批投入生产的车间的工作，进行第二批投入生产的车间的生产准备。
