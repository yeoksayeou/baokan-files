Long-Term Coexistence Must Advance Together
Chen Qiyuan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, and Chairman Mao's slogan of "Long live the Communist Party, long live the democratic parties" raised at the Supreme State Conference, have corrected many people's one-sided views on the democratic parties and inspired the political enthusiasm of the democratic party members. They are greatly beneficial to turning negative factors into positive forces and uniting all who can be united to participate in socialist construction. This policy and slogan are wise and timely, in line with the current international situation and China's historical circumstances, and demonstrate the great significance of combining the principles of Marxism-Leninism with flexibility, as well as the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. Now, I would like to share a few thoughts based on my personal study experience.

(I)

The general public's view on the "two long lives" and long-term coexistence can be divided into three schools of thought. The first is the "affirmative school," which analyzes the international situation and China's social conditions, estimates the role of the parties themselves, and studies the CCP's long-term united front policy based on the theories of Marxism-Leninism, arriving at an affirmative conclusion. Therefore, they feel at ease and happily take it as their responsibility to do the work of the democratic parties well. The second is the "skeptical school," which believes that the democratic parties are no longer necessary and that within five years at the earliest, or ten years at the latest, the organization itself will fade away and disappear. Therefore, they use a narrow scope and perfunctory attitude to deal with the work of the democratic parties, and even refuse to do the work of the democratic parties. The third is the "half-believing, half-doubting school," which, on the one hand, feels that the existence of democratic parties may be longer in China's special circumstances; on the other hand, feels that the socialist revolution is developing rapidly, and the democratic parties will lose their basis for existence as social classes gradually disappear, and that they will disappear earlier than the Communist Party, and will not coexist for a long time. Therefore, they are sometimes active and sometimes ideologically fluctuating in their work with the democratic parties, with a fluctuating attitude.

(II)

In the winter of 1947, some revolutionary members of the Kuomintang were preparing to form the "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang" in Hong Kong, and I was one of the initiators. I remember that a friend who led a certain democratic party asked me at the time: "What role can you play in participating in the founding of the RCCK? What is the future of the RCCK? What class does the RCCK represent?" I replied: "The RCCK includes patriots from all classes who are anti-imperialist and anti-feudal (including those from landlords and capitalists, as well as workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the lumpen proletariat). It represents the revolutionary demands of patriots in various classes within the original Kuomintang. The Kuomintang has twice had the historical fact of fighting alongside the Communist Party. I participated in the government and revolutionary activities of the first KMT-CPC cooperation. I have been separated from the Kuomintang for twenty years since 1927 until now (1947) because I opposed Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's policies of openly betraying the revolution, being anti-Soviet and anti-communist, surrendering to the enemy and selling out the country. My influence in the Kuomintang will not be great; but Song Qingling, He Xiangning, Peng Zemin, Deng Yanda, and others and I resolutely opposed Wang Chiang's anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies in 1927 and abided by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Today, under the call of the united front led by the great Chinese Communist Party, in the Liberation War, I will still have a certain influence on the patriots in the Chiang gang and the true followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen." From today's perspective, the questions asked by that friend at the time underestimated the role of long-term coexistence of democratic parties, and still had a considerable shortsighted and partial view.

(III)

Those who are too conservative in their thinking and lose their sensitivity to new things often, when issues related to national construction and social transformation are raised for discussion, regardless of whether these issues are in line with universally applicable truths, or whether there are concrete facts as a basis for opposing the issues, insist that they are not in line with China's historical national conditions and should not be learned from the Soviet Union, and like to put forward the "China special theory," which often temporarily hinders the progress of certain undertakings. This China special theory has become a stumbling block in our socialist construction and must be corrected. However, it is also a fact that the solution of some practical problems in the process of China's revolutionary struggle is different from the Soviet revolutionary struggle methods. If there were no broad people's democratic united front of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people would not have been able to achieve revolutionary victory so quickly. It would also not have been possible to achieve such great and smooth achievements in the current socialist transformation of agriculture, private industry and commerce, and handicrafts. This is a different method of struggle that we cannot find in studying the Soviet revolutionary history. This is also a truth of Marxism-Leninism enriched in China's revolutionary practice that is well known to all. The long-term coexistence of democratic parties is based on this truth and experienced. The democratic parties have cooperated in the past, are cooperating now, and will cooperate in the future. The long-term coexistence of democratic parties is a summary of in-depth investigation of the objective laws of the Chinese revolution, and not an objective truth that can be obliterated by any subjective wishes.

(IV)

Some people ask, what is the theoretical basis for long-term coexistence in Marxism-Leninism? Indeed, the classic works of Marxism-Leninism do not explicitly state that the Communist Party and democratic parties can coexist for a long time. But I think it does not write out a clause opposing long-term coexistence. Human society is constantly changing and developing. Marxism-Leninism is powerful because it can always pay attention to the changes and developments in human society in order to guide its own practice. The specific practice of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union is the dictatorship of the proletariat (socialist democracy is the highest level of democracy). However, during the February Revolution, Lenin also coexisted with the bourgeois party (Social Revolutionary Party) for a short period of time. Only when the bourgeois party thoroughly surrendered to the enemy and betrayed the motherland did Lenin resolutely abandon these political swindlers and expose their ugly faces. During the October Revolution, Lenin did not refuse to cooperate with other parties willing to revolutionize, nor did he regard armed revolution as the only way to enter socialist society. Only when the bourgeois party colluded with imperialism to massacre the Russian revolutionary people, refused to cooperate, and undermined peace did Lenin call on the people to take up arms, repel the enemy, and strive for revolutionary victory. This is the same as the Chinese Communist Party's repeated peaceful negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek group before the liberation of China, but Chiang Kai-shek did not want peace, continued to surrender to foreign countries, attacked the revolutionary forces, and massacred patriotic and progressive people. Only then did the Communist Party lead the people to carry out armed struggle to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime.

There are many methods to move towards socialist society (armed uprising and peaceful transition, etc.). There are many forms (Soviet dictatorship and people's democratic dictatorship, etc.). All roads lead to socialism and communism. The nature of our country's current socialist revolution is the same as that of the Soviet Union, but the specific paths it has taken are also different from those of the Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties today have the objective requirements and historical facts of "long-term coexistence." The Soviet Communist Party, under the circumstances of that time, did not have such objective conditions that made it possible for it to coexist with other parties for a long time. Therefore, the policy of long-term coexistence is not thought out by people, but is precisely prescribed by certain historical conditions. It is in line with the development principles of Marxism-Leninism. The combination of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, the combination of principle and flexibility, is a valuable experience of the Chinese revolution.

(V)

The policy of long-term coexistence embodies the superiority of the socialist system and embodies the high degree of development of socialist democracy in China. The long-term coexistence of our various parties does not mean that society will not advance for a long time, and we still coexist in the old way of life, because the change in the relations of production, the way of life of people has to change accordingly. Society is advancing, and socialist construction and socialist transformation are a great force. New trends of life are fluctuating around people day and night, and you cannot help but change. Existence determines consciousness. People's own subjective consciousness must truthfully and correctly reflect the changes in the objective world, and progress with the development of productive forces, changes in relations of production, and improvement of material and cultural living standards. Otherwise, you will lag behind in a short period of time and not keep up with the progress of the times, and it will be impossible to coexist with others, let alone coexist with others for a long time. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for groups. The irresistible force of the socialist system and its superiority lies here. It can inspire people's enthusiasm for learning and labor competition. It can make democratic life gradually move towards a higher degree of development.

Mutual supervision is another manifestation of criticism and self-criticism, and is a high degree of development of socialist democracy. It is incompatible with the cult of personality. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union bravely put forward the struggle against the cult of personality in the 20th National Congress. This is because the Soviet system is becoming more and more consolidated, and socialist theory has the highest prestige among the people. The so-called theory grasped by the masses becomes a real force. It is not afraid of being attacked and squeezed out by others because it has exposed its shortcomings. On the contrary, it is promoting democracy, so that the party overcomes its shortcomings, gains new vitality, and promotes the work to a further step. The application of criticism and self-criticism has achieved a typical example that has never been seen before. This victory has world-historical significance.

It can be seen that mutual supervision is a more substantial and richer manifestation of criticism and self-criticism. From common consultation to long-term coexistence is a major development in our country's political life. "Long-term coexistence" in political parties and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in academics influence and promote each other. Resonance is also competition. Idealistic expressions are permissible. Idealists will gain progress in the process of expression due to learning from each other's strengths and overcoming their weaknesses. They may gradually change and develop into dialectical materialists. Long-term coexistence makes our country's people's democratic united front more expanded and consolidated, and letting a hundred schools of thought contend makes our country appear a new era of academic prosperity.

(VI)

How long is long-term? I think we should not regard long-term as "forever," and we should not see the problem too rigidly. How long it will be can be finally decided by history. Due to the elimination of classes, the state apparatus will decline in the future, the Communist Party will also disappear, and the democratic parties will certainly no longer exist. Long-term coexistence includes the significance of long-term joint efforts to seek progress. Everyone should work hard to promote the early arrival of the conditions for the elimination of classes and thus the elimination of parties, so as to achieve the most beautiful ideal of mankind—a world of great harmony. I think that as members of the democratic parties, we must not rely on long-term coexistence as a shield and rely on the signboard of long-term coexistence to make a living. We should rely on our own efforts to seek progress and enter socialist-communist society together with the people of the whole country. If we stick to the old ways and do not do well, we will die halfway, and there is no way to talk about long-term or not. The idea of "drinking today's wine today and getting drunk, not asking whether tomorrow is right or wrong" is certainly not a good negative attitude. However, if some people are too far-sighted and worry about the future generations for thousands of generations, it is also impractical. The future generations' paths of life and the methods to reach these paths are infinitely rich and very specific. They will have their own ideas and practices, and they will make even greater achievements than our older generation. Don't think of yourself as so smart and your descendants as so stupid. Future generations will be much smarter than us. It is not that one generation is not as good as the previous generation, but that "the student surpasses the teacher."

From yesterday, today to tomorrow for a long period of time, China's democratic parties have played, are playing, and will continue to play a role. All democratic party members do a good job of the democratic parties, unite all who can be united, explore all potential factors and forces, and jointly build socialism. Everyone will enter socialist society together, and the people will evaluate the merits of each party and its members and give them appropriate arrangements. Therefore, the democratic parties under long-term coexistence are organizations that serve the people and seek progress for themselves, not "political party forces," let alone individual "political capital." To do a good job, we must supervise each other and make progress together! Forgetting the significance of common progress, long-term coexistence will lose its reliable material basis.

    长期共存必须共同进步
    中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员　陈其瑗
    中国共产党中央提出的共产党和民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针和毛主席在最高国务会议中提出的“共产党万岁，民主党派万岁”的口号，端正了许多人对民主党派的片面看法，鼓舞了民主党派成员的政治热情，对于把消极因素变为积极力量，团结一切可能团结的人参加社会主义建设的工作，大有裨益。这一方针和口号是英明而又适时的，符合目前国际形势和中国的历史情况，显示出马克思列宁主义的原则性与灵活性相结合的重大意义，显示出社会主义制度的无比优越性。现就个人学习体会，谈谈几点感想。
                      （一）
    一般人对“两个万岁”长期共存的看法可分三派，一是“肯定派”，这些人分析国际形势和中国的社会情况，估计了党派本身的作用，根据马克思列宁主义的学说，研究了中共长期以来的统一战线政策，下了肯定的结论。因而心安理得，愉快地以做好民主党派的工作为己任。二是“怀疑派”，说民主党派再无存在必要，快则五年，迟则十载，这种组织本身就要从淡退到消亡，因而用缩窄范围，应付门面的态度来敷衍民主党派的工作，甚至不肯做民主党派的工作。三是“半信半疑派”，一方面，觉得民主党派的存在，在中国的特殊情况下，可能较长些；另一方面觉得社会主义革命发展迅速，民主党派随着社会阶级的逐渐消灭而丧失存在根据，它要比共产党更早的消亡，不会长期共存。因而，对民主党派工作有时积极，有时思想波动，存在着忽冷忽热的态度。
                      （二）
    1947年冬，一些国民党革命人士在香港筹组“中国国民党革命委员会”，我也是发起人之一。记得当时有一位领导某民主党派的朋友问我：“你参加发起民革能够起些什么作用？民革有什么前途？民革代表着什么阶级？”我答：“民革包括了反帝反封建的各阶层（其中有出身于地主、资本家，也有工人、农民、知识分子、流氓无产阶级）的爱国人士，他代表原来国民党内各阶层中爱国人士的革命要求。国民党有过两次和共产党并肩作战的历史事实，我参加过第一次国共合作的政府和革命活动。我自1927年起到现在（1947年），因为反对蒋介石汪精卫公开背叛革命的反苏反共、降敌卖国的政策而脱离了国民党，已有二十年之久，我在国民党的影响是不会很大的；但我与宋庆龄、何香凝、彭泽民、邓演达等是1927年坚决反对汪蒋的反苏反共政策、遵守孙中山先生遗教之人，今天在伟大的中国共产党领导的统一战线号召之下，在解放战争中，对蒋帮中的爱国人士和真正孙中山先生的信徒还会发生一定的影响作用”。从今天看来，当时那位朋友的问话，对于民主党派长期共存的作用还估计不足，还带有相当的短视和局部的看法。
                      （三）
    思想过于保守、对新鲜事物失掉敏感的人士，往往当着有关国家建设和社会改造事业问题被提出讨论之时，不管这些被提出的问题是否符合于放之四海而皆准的真理，也不管有无具体事实作为反对提出问题的依据，硬说这是不合中国历史国情，不应向苏联学习，喜欢提出“中国特殊论”，使得某些事业的前进往往因之暂时受到一定的阻抑。这种中国特殊论成为我们社会主义建设前进中的绊脚石，这是必须纠正的。不过，在中国革命斗争过程中的确有些实际问题的解决与苏联革命斗争方式有所不同也是事实。如果没有以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线，中国人民将不可能那么快就取得革命的胜利。对目前农业、私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造，也不可能得到这么伟大而顺利的成就。这是我们在学习苏联革命史中所找不到的不同斗争方法。这也是人所共知在中国革命实践中所丰富的马克思列宁主义的真理。各民主党派的长期共存，就是依据这个真理而体验出来的。各民主党派过去合作过，现在合作着，将来要合作下去。民主党派长期共存是对中国革命客观规律深入考察所得的总结，不是任何主观愿望可以抹煞的客观真理。
                      （四）
    有人问，长期共存在马克思列宁主义中有什么理论根据？诚然，在马克思列宁主义经典著作中，没有写明共产党和民主党派可以长期共存这些字句。但我想，它也没有写出反对长期共存这一条。人类社会时刻处在变化发展中，马克思列宁主义之所以有力是由于它能够时刻注意到人类社会的变化发展，以指导自己的实践。马克思列宁主义在苏联的具体实践，是无产阶级专政（社会主义民主是最高级的民主）。但在二月革命时，列宁还同资产阶级政党（社会革命党）共处过一个短时期，只有当资产阶级政党彻头彻尾的投降敌人、叛变祖国以后，列宁才坚决把这些政治骗子抛弃，并把这些骗子的丑恶面目予以揭露。十月革命时，列宁也并不是不要与其他愿意革命的党派合作，也并不是仅以武装革命为唯一的进入社会主义社会的方法，只有当资产阶级政党勾结帝国主义屠杀俄国革命人民，不愿合作，破坏和平的时候，列宁才号召人民拿起刀枪，把敌人打退，争取革命的胜利。这一点和中国解放前中国共产党屡次跟蒋介石集团和平谈判，但蒋介石不要和平，继续投降外国，向革命势力进攻，屠杀爱国进步人士，共产党才领导人民进行武装斗争把蒋介石反动政权推翻掉一样。
    走向社会主义社会有许多种方法（武装起义与和平过渡等办法）。有许多种形式（苏维埃专政与人民民主专政等形式），条条道路通向社会主义和共产主义。我国目前社会主义革命的性质与苏联相同，但所走过的具体道路却与苏联也有不尽相同之处。中国共产党和各民主党派今天有“长期共存”的客观要求和历史事实，苏联共产党在当年情况下，则没有这样的客观条件，使它能有与其他各党派长期共存的可能性。所以，长期共存的方针，不是人们想出来的，恰恰是为一定的历史条件所规定的，它是符合于马克思列宁主义的发展原则的。马列主义的一般原则与中国革命具体实践相结合，原则性与灵活性相结合，是中国革命的一条宝贵经验。
            （五）
    长期共存的方针，体现出社会主义制度的优越性，体现出社会主义民主在中国的高度发展。我们的各党派长期共存，不是意味着社会长期不前进、我们依然共同存在旧的生活方式中，因为生产关系的改变，人的生活方式也不得不随之改变。社会在前进，社会主义建设和社会主义改造是一股伟大的力量，新的生活潮流不分昼夜地在人们的周围动荡着，不由你不改变。存在决定意识，人们自己的主观意识必须如实、正确反映客观世界的变化，随着生产力的发展、生产关系的改变、物质文化生活水平的提高而进步，不然，你本身在短期内落伍了，赶不上时代的进展，就不可能与人共存，更谈不到与人长期共存。个人如此，集团也如此。社会主义制度的不可抗拒的力量和它的优越性就在这里，它能鼓舞人们的学习热情和劳动竞赛，它能使民主生活逐渐走向更高度的发展。
    互相监督就是批评与自我批评的另一种表现方式，是社会主义民主的高度发展。它与个人崇拜是不相容的。苏联共产党在二十次代表大会中勇敢地提出反对个人崇拜的斗争，正是由于苏维埃制度越来越巩固了，社会主义理论在人民群众中有最高的威信，所谓理论掌握了群众便成为真正的力量了，他不怕因暴露了自己的缺点受人攻击，被人挤垮，而恰恰是发扬民主，使党克服了缺点，获得了新的活力，推动了工作更前进一步。批评与自我批评的运用在这里得到了从来未有过的一个典型的范例，这一胜利具有世界性的历史意义。
    由此可见，互相监督是批评与自我批评的生活更充实和更丰富的表现，由共同协商到长期共存是我国政治生活的一个重大发展。长期共存与互相监督是不可分割的，党派上的“长期共存”与学术上的“百家争鸣”是互相影响互相推动的。共鸣也是竞赛，唯心主义的鸣是可以的，唯心主义者在鸣的过程中将因取长补短而获得了进步，他可能逐渐变化发展而成为辩证唯物主义者。长期共存使我国的人民民主统一战线更趋扩大和巩固，百家争鸣使我国出现一个学术繁荣昌盛的新时代。
                      （六）
    长期，长到什么时候？我以为不要把长期作为“千秋万代”看，不要把问题看得太死了，长到什么时候，可由历史作最后决定。由于阶级的消灭，国家机构将来要衰亡，共产党也要消灭，民主党派当然也不再存在。长期共存，包括了长期共同努力以求进步的意义，要大家努力，促进阶级消灭从而党派消灭条件的早日到来，以达到人类最美满的理想——大同世界。我认为，作为民主党派的成员，万不可以凭借长期共存作盾牌，依靠长期共存的招牌吃饭，应该以依靠自己的努力求进步，和全国人民一起共同进入社会主义——共产主义社会。如果故步自封，不好自为之，自己就会半途夭折，根本谈不到长期不长期问题。“今朝有酒今天醉，不问明天是与非”的想法固然是不好的消极态度。但如果有的人专为千秋万代的子孙想得太远，杞人忧天，这也不切实际，子孙们明天的生活道路与走向这道路的办法是无限丰富而又十分具体的，他们将有他们的想法和做法，他们会做出比我们这老一辈更其伟大的事业。不要把自己看得那样聪明而子孙那样愚蠢。子孙将比我们聪明得多，不是一代不如一代，而是“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。
    从昨天、今天以至明天一个长时期，中国的民主党派曾经、正在而且还要发生作用，一切民主党派成员做好了民主党派的工作，团结一切可以团结的人，发掘一切潜在的因素和力量，共同建设社会主义，大家将会一同进入社会主义社会，人民将会评价每个党派及其成员的功绩，给以恰当的安排。所以，长期共存下的民主党派，是为人民服务为自己求进步的组织，不是什么“政党势力”，更不是个人的什么“政治资本”。而要做好工作，必须相互监督，共同进步！忘记了共同进步这一意义，长期共存就丧失了可靠的物质基础。
