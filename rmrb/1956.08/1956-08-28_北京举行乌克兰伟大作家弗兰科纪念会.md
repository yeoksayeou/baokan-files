Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Beijing held a commemoration meeting tonight for the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ivan Franko, a world cultural figure.

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech, saying: The Chinese people are responding to the call of the World Peace Council to commemorate world cultural figures. Today, we are holding a grand gathering in Beijing to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ivan Yakovlevich Franko, a great Ukrainian writer. Ivan Franko was a writer of great talent, who wrote in various literary styles and translated a large number of classical literary works from various countries. He was also a political commentator and linguist with an extremely sharp pen. In his works, he exposed the difficult and painful lives of the working people and expressed the desire of the oppressed people for light and freedom. He was an enthusiastic revolutionary fighter who called on the people to fight for the happiness of mankind and the unity and friendship of people all over the world. The outstanding literary works he left behind are not only a treasure of the Ukrainian people, but also an integral part of the world's cultural treasury. Wu Yuzhang said: Let him take this opportunity to express his lofty respect to the Ukrainian people who gave birth to this great writer.

Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and member of the Council of the Chinese Writers Association, spoke at the meeting, introducing Ivan Franko's life and works.

Valera, the person in charge of cultural issues of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council and an Argentine writer who is currently in Beijing, also attended the commemoration meeting. He said in his speech: Ivan Franko was an artist who deeply cared about the sufferings and hopes of the people. He knew how to dedicate what he had learned to others. He translated literary works from many countries into Ukrainian and commented on famous poets and writers from various countries. He contributed to the mutual understanding between the people of various countries. We hope that Ivan Franko's work will be practiced on a larger scale in various countries, so that people will understand that the people of all countries have also contributed to the world's common cultural heritage. In this way, people will better understand the necessity of peaceful and friendly cooperation between countries, and support and establish this cooperation.

Yuri Zbanatsky, member of the Council and Presidium of the Ukrainian Writers Association and Hero of the Soviet Union, who was invited to Beijing to attend the commemoration meeting, also spoke at the meeting. He said: As a revolutionary and a singer of the people, Ivan Franko took the torch of revolutionary struggle from Shevchenko's hands and continued to move forward with it. The significance of all his activities was to fight for mankind to free itself from the oppression of landlords and capitalists. He also expressed the thoughts and ideals of the contemporary masses to a great extent through his works.

Then, actors Wang Wang, Hu Zongwen, Zhu Lin, Su Min, and Zheng Rong recited Ivan Franko's poems. Finally, the Ukrainian color song and dance film "Ukraine Sings" was shown.

Tonight's commemoration meeting was sponsored by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
