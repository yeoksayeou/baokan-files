Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 4th: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement opposing the French government's position on Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. The statement emphasized that France's interests have nothing in common with the privileges of the Suez Canal Company's management.

The statement said that the Egyptian government's decision is legitimate. No socialist, no democrat, can oppose this nationalization. The Egyptian people, like other peoples who have long been oppressed by colonialism and have now been liberated, are unwilling to allow their national wealth to continue to be plundered by foreign merchants.

The statement pointed out that the Egyptian government has promised to guarantee freedom of navigation, not to increase the cost of ships passing through the canal, and to compensate shareholders for their losses. Therefore, there is no reason to maintain the enormous privileges of the Suez Canal Company's capitalists and issue various threats.

After accusing the French government of wanting to deny Egypt's "nationalization" of the canal and taking provocative actions, the statement said that a policy of force against Egypt is contrary to France's national interests. This policy requires us to pay a heavy price for the ambitions of capitalists. This policy runs counter to the relaxation of international relations; it will make it more difficult to resolve the Algerian question on the basis of negotiation; it will arouse the hatred and severe condemnation of the countries of the Middle East, thereby weakening France's position in the world.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party called for preventing any military measures, exposed the provocative nature of refusing to pay Suez Canal tolls, and demanded a peaceful resolution of the dispute through negotiation. The statement said that only this path "is in line with France's honor and interests and the task of consolidating the friendship of all peoples."

    法共指责法政府对埃及挑衅
    要求通过协商和平解决争端
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法国共产党政治局发表声明，表示反对法国政府对于埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有一事的立场。声明着重指出，法国的利益同苏彝士运河公司管理人的特权没有任何共同之处。
    声明说，埃及政府的决定是合法的。任何一个社会主义者，任何一个民主主义者，都不能反对这种国有化。埃及人民也像其他曾经长期受殖民主义压迫而现在得到了解放的各国人民一样，不愿意让本国财富仍然被外国商人所掠夺。
    声明指出，埃及政府已经答应保障航行自由，不增加船只通过运河的费用，补偿股东所受的损失。因此，没有任何理由来维护苏彝士运河公司资本家的巨大特权并且发出各种威胁。
    在指责法国政府想否认埃及对运河的“国有化”并且采取了挑衅性的行动之后，声明说，以强力对付埃及的政策是违背法国的民族利益的。这种政策要求我们为了资本家的野心而付出沉重的牺牲。这种政策是同国际关系的缓和背道而驰的；它会使在协商的基础上解决阿尔及利亚问题更为困难；它会引起中近东各国对我们的仇视和严厉的指责，从而削弱法国在全世界的地位。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局号召防止采取任何军事措施，它揭露拒绝缴纳苏彝士运河通行费的挑拨性质，要求通过协商来和平解决争执问题。声明中说，只有这条道路才“符合法国的荣誉和利益以及巩固各国人民的友谊的任务”。
