    The Soviet Union's Constructive Proposals
    On August 9th, the Soviet government issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue. This statement is of great significance for safeguarding international justice and world peace, and fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's consistent stance of upholding international justice and safeguarding world peace.
    The Soviet statement first exposed the Western countries' attempts to confuse the public and create excuses for interfering in Egypt's internal affairs. The statement pointed out that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company had nothing to do with the issue of guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, as stipulated in the 1888 special convention. In the statement, the Soviet government strongly supported Egypt's position, pointing out that the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company was a completely legitimate action taken in accordance with Egyptian sovereignty. This position of the Soviet Union provided strong moral support for Egypt's actions in exercising its sovereignty in the Suez Canal area.
    Based on the actual actions taken by the Egyptian government after nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, and the fact that the canal has always maintained smooth navigation, the Soviet government pointed out that the Western powers' claim that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company "threatens" "freedom of navigation" is groundless.
    Throughout the Soviet statement, there is a consistent respect for Egyptian sovereignty and international morality, and a strong condemnation of the Western powers' attempts in this day and age to maintain the relationships established in the past through conquest and occupation. This statement fully embodies the Soviet Union's sympathy and support for all countries striving for independence and resolutely safeguarding their sovereignty, proving that the Soviet Union is a faithful and selfless friend of all people fighting for their independence and freedom.
    The Soviet government's statement pointed out that a series of war preparations taken by Britain and France near the Suez Canal, which would endanger peace and security, have created a tense situation in the Middle East. The Soviet government believes that the measures currently being taken by the British and French governments are completely intolerable and considers them to be a provocation to the cause of peace. The Soviet Union resolutely upholds the principles of the United Nations Charter, opposes the use of the threat of force in international relations, and firmly advocates resolving international issues through peaceful negotiation on the basis of respect for national sovereignty. The Soviet statement pointed out, "The Soviet government believes that respect for national sovereignty and the development of international cooperation on the basis of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, in accordance with the spirit of the times, are the most important conditions for strengthening international trust and ensuring lasting international peace."
    The Soviet Union agreed to send representatives to the London conference initiated by Britain, France, and the United States to discuss the Suez Canal issue because it hoped to explore ways to resolve the issues related to the Suez Canal in a way that could be accepted by all parties concerned, taking into account the new situation. However, the Soviet government also pointed out that the London conference proposed by Britain, France, and the United States, whether in terms of its members or the nature of the conference, cannot be regarded as an international conference with the right to make decisions on the Suez Canal. Therefore, the Soviet Union advocates rescheduling the conference and advocates that all countries related to the 1888 convention and the use of the canal should participate in the conference. The Soviet statement also specifically mentioned that "the Soviet government believes that it is necessary for a major country like the People's Republic of China to participate in this conference." If the Western three countries are sincere in conducting peaceful negotiations on the Suez Canal issue, they have no reason to reject the Soviet Union's constructive proposals.

    苏联的建设性的建议
    八月九日，苏联政府就苏彝士运河问题发表了一项声明。这个声明对于维护国际正义与世界和平事业具有重大的意义，充分地说明了苏联对主持国际正义与维护世界和平的一贯立场。
    苏联的声明首先揭露了西方国家那种企图混淆视听、替干涉埃及内政制造借口的说法。声明指出，苏彝士运河公司的国有化同1888年专门公约规定的保证苏彝士运河通航自由的问题没有任何关系。苏联政府在声明中有力地支持了埃及的立场，指出埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定是根据埃及主权作出的完全合法的行动。苏联的这一立场对埃及在苏彝士运河区行使其主权的行动给予了强有力的道义上的支持。
    苏联政府根据埃及政府在把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后的实际行动，和运河至今始终保持顺畅通航的事实，指出西方强国关于苏彝士运河公司国有化“威胁”了“航行自由”的说法是毫无根据的。
    在苏联的声明中，自始至终贯串着对埃及主权和国际道义的尊重，并且对西方强国在今天的时代还企图保持过去通过征服和占领的方法建立起来的关系作了有力的谴责。这个声明充分体现了苏联对一切争取独立、坚决维护自己主权的国家的同情和支持，证明苏联是一切为自己的独立和自由而斗争的人民的忠实无私的朋友。
    苏联政府的声明指出，英国和法国在苏彝士运河附近采取的一系列会危及和平和安全的备战措施，造成了中近东的紧张局势。苏联政府认为，英、法两国政府目前所采取的措施是完全不能容忍的，并且认为这是对和平事业的挑衅。苏联坚决维护联合国宪章的原则，反对在国际关系中使用武力威胁，并且坚决主张在尊重国家主权的基础上经由和平协商的途径来解决国际问题。苏联声明指出，“苏联政府相信，对国家主权的尊重以及根据时代的精神在平等和不干涉他国内政的基础上发展国际合作，是加强国际信任、保证国际持久和平的最重要的条件。”
    苏联同意派代表参加英、法、美三国所发起的讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议，因为它希望通过这一会议探求途径，以便用在估计到新的情况下能为有关各方接受的方法解决同苏彝士运河有关的问题。但是，苏联政府也指出，英、法、美三国建议举行的伦敦会议不论从会议成员来看，或者从会议的性质来看，都不能被认为是一个有权对苏彝士运河作出决定的国际会议。因此，苏联主张重新安排会议的召开日期，并主张凡是同1888年公约以及同运河使用有关的国家都应该参加会议。苏联声明还特别提到，“苏联政府认为像中华人民共和国这样的大国参加这个会议是必要的。”如果西方三国有诚意来就苏彝士运河问题进行和平协商的话，它们就没有任何理由拒绝苏联的建设性的建议。
