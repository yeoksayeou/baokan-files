    The Egyptian People Will Surely Triumph
    Editor's Note: This newspaper continues to receive many letters from readers, unanimously supporting Egypt's action to reclaim the Suez Canal. Due to space limitations, we are publishing a small selection of them here.
    The Colonialists' "Shock"
    Egypt's announcement of the decree to nationalize the Suez Canal Company is heartening news, but Western colonialists are "shocked"! It is only right and proper to "return something to its original owner," so why are they "shocked"?
    The United States and Britain previously promised to help Egypt build the Aswan High Dam with ulterior motives; they attempted to exchange this for Egypt's national independence and freedom. When their wishful thinking failed, they became angry and revoked their proposal to help Egypt build the dam, dreaming of coercing Egypt into submission. Who knew that Egypt not only did not yield but instead announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal? The colonialists regarded the Suez Canal as their own family property, and now this hope has been dashed, so it is no wonder they are "shocked."
    The struggle of all invaded countries to fight for and safeguard their national independence and sovereignty is rising day by day, and the colonialists will have more "shocking" days ahead!
                    Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Yu Zhibin
    Difficulties Can Be Overcome
    The U.S. government announced on July 19th that it was withdrawing its assistance to Egypt in building the Aswan High Dam because Egypt insisted on not accepting any conditions that would harm its freedom and independence. We deeply admire and sympathize with the Egyptian government's actions to defend its country's independence and freedom.
    We Chinese people understand very well any, even the smallest, difficulties that the Egyptian people encounter on the road to peace and the construction of an independent Egypt. Because we ourselves have encountered many difficulties in building our motherland today. In the early days of liberation, the U.S. government directed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to bomb our country's cities and also used blockades and embargoes to try to intimidate us. What was the result? As difficulties were overcome one by one, the Wall Street bosses only received disappointment. We understand the difficulties the Egyptian people are facing in their advance, and we understand even more the power and determination of the Egyptian people to protect their country's independence and sovereignty. Therefore, we believe that the Egyptian people will surely achieve victory in the struggle to overcome the difficulties in their advance. Changchun City, Nanjing Avenue, Cheng Mengbi
    Bringing New Strength and Courage to the People of Asia and Africa
    On July 26, the Egyptian government nationalized the International Suez Canal Company. This is another victory for the Egyptian people in their struggle to safeguard sovereignty and independence and oppose colonialism. This correct and resolute action by the Egyptian government has received the support of the broad masses of the Egyptian people. This not only fully conforms to the interests of the Egyptian people but will also inspire the surging anti-colonialist movement of the Asian and African peoples to move forward, bringing new strength and new courage to the people of Asia and Africa.
    Although the politicians of Western colonial countries are still shouting and clamoring, and are still discussing "countermeasures" day and night, this cannot intimidate the heroic Egyptian people. On the contrary, it clearly exposes the embarrassing appearance of imperialism to the people of the world. The Suez Canal was built by the Egyptian people with their blood and sweat and is the property of the Egyptian people themselves. No matter how the Western colonialists shout, they can never change this fact and will only arouse more condemnation from all righteous people.
    Congratulations to the heroic Egyptian people on their great victory! Beijing, Liu Kaimo

### 埃及人民一定会取得胜利

    埃及人民一定会取得胜利
    编者按：本报继续收到了许多读者的来信，一致支持埃及收回苏彝士运河的行动。因为限于篇幅，我们选登了一小部分在这里。
    殖民主义者的“震惊”
    埃及宣布了把苏彝士运河收归国有的法令，这是一件振奋人心的消息，但是西方殖民主义者却感到“震惊”！“物归原主”这乃是天经地义的事情，他们却为何“震惊”呢？
    美国和英国以前答应帮助埃及建筑阿斯旺高水坝是别有用心的，他们企图以此换取埃及的民族独立和自由。当他们的如意算盘落空的时候，便老羞成怒，撤销了帮助埃及建筑水坝的建议，梦想以此胁迫埃及就范。谁知，埃及不但没有屈服，反而宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有。殖民主义者把苏彝士运河当成自己的家业，现在这个想望又落了空，难怪他们要感到“震惊”了。
    各被侵略国家争取和维护自己民族独立和主权的斗争正在日益高涨，殖民主义者“震惊”的日子还在后头呢！
                    北京市中苏友好协会　于质彬
    困难是能够战胜的
    美国政府七月十九日宣布撤销对埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的帮助，是因为埃及坚持不接受任何有损自由与独立的条件。我们对埃及政府坚持保卫自己国家的独立自由的行动，深深表示敬佩与同情。
    在为和平与建设独立的埃及的道路上，埃及人民遇到的任何的那怕是极小的困难，我们中国人民是很了解的。因为我们自己在建设祖国的今天，遇到过不少的困难。在初解放时，美国政府指使蒋介石集团轰炸祖国的城市，也用什么封锁禁运想把我们吓倒，结果怎样呢？随着困难一个个的被克服，华尔街老板们得到的只是失望而已。我们了解埃及人民在前进中的困难，更了解埃及人民保护祖国独立和主权的力量和决心；因此，我们相信埃及人民在战胜他们前进中的困难的斗争中，一定会取得胜利。　长春市南京大街　程梦笔
    给亚非人民带来新的力量和勇气
    七月二十六日，埃及政府把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有了，这是埃及人民维护主权和独立、反对殖民主义斗争的又一胜利。埃及政府这一正确而又坚决的行动，得到了埃及广大人民的支持，这不但完全符合埃及人民的利益，并且将鼓舞正在澎湃开展的亚非人民反殖民主义运动推向前进，给亚非人民带来新的力量和新的勇气。
    尽管西方殖民国家的政客们还在大叫大嚷，还在夜以继日地商讨什么“对策”，但这并不能吓倒英勇的埃及人民；相反的，倒把帝国主义那副狼狈相清楚地暴露在全世界人民的面前了。苏彝士运河是埃及人民用血汗建筑起来的，是埃及人民自己的财产。西方殖民主义者无论怎样叫嚷，它们绝对改变不了这个事实，而只会激起一切正义人民更多的谴责。
    祝贺英雄的埃及人民取得的伟大胜利！　北京　刘开谟
