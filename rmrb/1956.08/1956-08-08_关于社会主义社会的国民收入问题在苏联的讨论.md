On the essence of national income in socialist society, the creation of national income, and other related issues, the Soviet economic community had different opinions even before the Patriotic War. In recent years, especially after Mo. Paul published the article "On Several Issues of National Income in Socialist Society" in the Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine, No. 10, 1954, the Soviet economic community launched a discussion on these issues. This is a brief introduction to some of the issues touched upon in this discussion that are of important reference value to our academic community.

First, what is the essence of national income in socialist society? Is the national income of socialist society newly created value?

On this issue, Mo. Paul believes that only in capitalist society does social product divide according to value into transferred value and newly created value (national income). The national income of socialist society is not newly created value, but the part of the product newly created by socially necessary labor within the year. However, because two forms of public ownership still exist in socialist society, national income must be planned and calculated in monetary and value forms. He said: "In our economic publications, it is often said that the national income of the Soviet Union is newly created value. Can the national income of socialist society be determined as newly created value in the same way as the national income of capitalist society? We believe it is not possible. Saying that national income is newly created value only reflects the characteristics of capitalist commodity production... The means of production in socialist society actually have no value, so they cannot transfer value to the products created. Some economists, when analyzing the total social product and national income of socialist society, use concepts (categories) that precisely reflect the characteristics of capitalist production, such as 'value,' 'transferred value,' and 'newly created value.' ... However, even if the national income of socialist society is not newly created value, at the socialist stage, under the condition that there are still two major production sectors in the national economy, the production and utilization of national income can only be planned and calculated with the help of monetary and value forms." As for what the national income in socialist society is, he believes it is "that part of the product newly created by socially necessary labor within the year" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

Fu. Belkin criticized the above opinion, believing that value is not a category unique to capitalist commodity production, but also one of the categories of socialist production. And value is composed of transferred value and newly created value. He pointed out: "Everyone knows that value is not only a category of capitalist commodity production, but generally a category of all commodity production. As long as there is commodity production in the Soviet Union, the law of value plays a role. Therefore, value is one of the categories of socialist production. Why, in this case, would the components of value—the value transferred from the means of production and the newly created value—reflect the characteristics of capitalist production? As long as there is value, it is composed of transferred value and newly created value, isn't that clear? ... Therefore, the definition that national income is that part of the total social product that represents newly created value is also completely correct for socialist society" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956). In addition, De. Alakhverdyan also believes that "national income expressed in value is the total amount of newly created value by society" ("Economic Issues," No. 2, 1954).

Because of the different views on this fundamental issue, some other issues directly related to the fundamental issue also have different opinions. For example: Mo. Paul believes that in the social production process, a part of products and income will be lost, which requires the introduction of the indicator of "national income used" in addition to the indicator of "national income created." He pointed out: "The total amount of national income (or so-called national income used) grasped when formulating the plan for the utilization and distribution of national income is less than the actual amount of national income created, which means that a part of products and income will be lost in the social production process. Therefore, in order to further check the correctness of the calculation of the amount of national income created (because the amount of distribution depends on the amount of creation) and to coordinate the product balance sheet and the income balance sheet, and to determine the main indicators of the improvement of the welfare of the Soviet working people, the calculation of 'national income used' is of special significance" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954). Fu. Belkin criticized this view, believing that it is a wrong argument derived from the wrong premise that the national income of socialist society is not newly created value. He believes that as long as one recognizes that national income is newly created value, then one will know that some necessary losses (such as the reduction in weight after the rice is dried) that occur in the process of creating national income will not reduce national income. Therefore, he believes that dividing it into two different national income indicators—national income created and national income used—is "unfounded" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

For example: Mo. Paul pointed out that in some sectors of the national economy, the national income is not created by the sector itself, but the national income created by other sectors is realized through the products of the sector. Therefore, he believes that "now it is not only necessary to formulate a calculation method for the realized national income for each sector, but also to determine a calculation method for the actual national income created" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954). Fu. Belkin pointed out on this issue that this issue can only be resolved by starting from the premise that national income is newly created value and the deviation between the prices and values of products in various sectors.

Second, what are the factors that affect the growth of national income in socialist society? Should the growth of national income in socialist society be calculated in terms of value and physical volume?

On this issue, because Mo. Paul fundamentally denied that the national income of socialist society is newly created value, he believes that the growth of national income in socialist society cannot be calculated separately in terms of value and physical volume, and opposes analyzing the factors of national income growth in socialist society in this way. He pointed out: "Until now, many publications are still arguing about the factors of national income growth calculated in terms of value and physical volume. The root cause of this debate lies in the very popular concept that the national income of socialist society is newly created value. Only from this incorrect concept can it be said that numerical calculation is not merely a numerical game, but a beneficial thing. Some statistics textbooks are based on this calculation to determine that there are two factors affecting the 'value' growth of national income—the increase in working time and the saving of material consumption, and there are three factors affecting the physical volume growth of national income—the increase in working time, the improvement of labor productivity, and the saving of material consumption." As for what exactly affects the growth of national income in socialist society, he believes that there are two factors: "First, the growth of social production, and the growth of social production is affected by many factors, such as the increase in staff in the material production sector, the improvement of cadre skills, the improvement of labor productivity on the basis of new technologies, the expansion of socialist competition, and the rational utilization of natural resources; second, the relative reduction of productive material consumption" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

Fu. Belkin opposed this view, pointing out that it is possible and should analyze the factors of national income growth calculated in terms of value and physical volume. He also pointed out that the factors of national income growth proposed by Mo. Paul are inappropriate, such as attributing the reason for the improvement of labor productivity only to the adoption of new technologies. Fu. Belkin also put forward his own views, believing that the factors affecting the growth of the value and physical volume of national income: "The value of national income is completely determined by only one factor (not two?)—determined by the amount of social labor used (while paying attention to the skill level of labor, because complex, skilled labor creates more value than simple, unskilled labor in the same amount of time). ... There are two factors for the growth of the physical volume of national income: the improvement of social labor productivity and the large increase in the number of staff in material production" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

Third, which economic sectors create the national income of socialist society? How are the production and non-production sectors of socialist society divided?

On this issue, everyone agrees that industry, agriculture, construction, etc. are production sectors that create national income. The main point of contention lies in the two sectors of transportation and commerce.

Mo. Paul believes that the entire transportation industry belongs to the production sector and creates national income. He said: "Some economists (Fu. Soboli, A. Petrov, A. Baritsev) believe that not all of the transportation industry can be included in the production field, but only the part of the transportation industry that serves production should be included in the material production field, that is, passenger transport and so-called non-productive transportation should be excluded. We believe that this solution is fundamentally wrong. ... The only difference between industrial products for personal consumption and the products of passenger transportation and postal and telecommunications industries is that the first type of product should have a physical form after the production process is completed, while the second type of product cannot be separated from the production process, and this product is the human travel process itself or the labor services of the postal and telecommunications industry itself. ... In the transportation industry, consumption occurs simultaneously with production itself, but this does not mean that using transportation tools to carry passengers is not a material production process" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

This view has been opposed by others. For example, Fu. Belkin quoted Marx's words in "Capital" and Lenin's words in "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" to illustrate that passenger transportation cannot be included in the material production field. He pointed out: "Only those transportation industries that transport goods are the same as other material production sectors. Passenger transportation only provides labor services and therefore belongs to the field of management and services. ... Including passenger transportation and non-productive transportation in the material production field will eliminate the boundary between the production of social products and the provision of labor services, and make it impossible to make a clear division between the material production field and the management and service field" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

Regarding the question of whether commerce belongs to the field of material production, Mo. Paul believes: "Under socialist economic conditions, the essence of the circulation field and the essence of circulation costs have undergone fundamental changes. But does this mean that Soviet commerce has become a material production sector? Of course not. Labor in the field of commodity circulation is also non-productive in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, neither the necessity of non-productive labor nor the organizational characteristics of this labor can make this labor productive labor" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

Fu. Belkin, on the other hand, believes that the proportion of pure circulation costs in Soviet commerce is not large, so the socialist commercial sector cannot be completely included in the non-production sector. He said: "The circulation costs of Soviet commerce are mainly composed of the costs of the work done on commodities. In Soviet commerce, there are no grandstanding advertisements, speculative behaviors, intentional damage to commodities, and losses from special storage due to unsalable sales. Marx defined pure circulation costs as the costs generated by simple changes in value form. In the Soviet Union, the share of these costs is relatively low. Correspondingly, labor related to simple changes in value form only constitutes a relatively small part of the labor paid in commerce. Therefore, there is no basis for completely including Soviet commerce in the non-production field" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

Fourth, does socialist national income have redistribution in addition to the original distribution?

On this issue, Mo. Paul believes that socialist national income does not have redistribution, because the concept of "redistribution" reflects the characteristics of economic relations in class antagonistic societies, especially capitalist societies. He said: "Judging from the distribution process of national income in socialist society, there is no need to redistribute the already distributed national income. However, until now, our economic works still use the concept (category) of 'redistribution' when explaining the formation, utilization, and movement of national income. This refers to the distribution of national income through the fiscal system (budget, savings banks, state insurance); this is fundamentally different from the content of the concept of 'redistribution' in class societies with antagonistic contradictions. We believe that using this term distorts the true economic relations of socialist society" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

De. Alakhverdyan advocates that socialist national income has redistribution. He pointed out that redistribution under the socialist system is "the second distribution of a part of the already distributed national income, and the result of this distribution changes the owners of income" ("Economic Issues," No. 2, 1954). Fu. Belkin agrees with this view. He criticized Mo. Paul: "Comrade Paul believes that national income redistribution is only a supplementary means of exploiting the working people and is limited to the redistribution mechanism of the fiscal system, which artificially distorts the concept of redistribution. ... The fact that there is a field of management and service in addition to the field of material production determines the necessity of national income redistribution. ... In addition, there is the redistribution between the two parts of socialist production—the state-owned and the cooperative collective farm. ... It should be pointed out that the national income of the Soviet Union is not only redistributed through the fiscal system pointed out by Mo. Paul. National income redistribution is also realized through the mechanism of buying and selling labor services and prices" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

Related to this issue, the question arises of whether there is taxation in socialist society. Mo. Paul believes that the payments made by residents to the state in socialist society are not uncompensated and do not belong to the category of "redistribution," so they cannot be called taxes. He said: "Under socialist economic conditions, does the payment of funds by residents to the state mean that residents have uncompensatedly handed over a part of their income? (To whom?) Obligatory payments are a representation that each member of socialist society bears a part of the national expenses, such as expenses for culture and science, state administration, and national defense. Under socialist conditions, these expenses are as indispensable to the working people as the expenses for personal needs. ... The unreasonable term 'turnover tax' is to be abolished, but not because the turnover tax does not change the owner, but because this amount is not a tax, that is, it is not a part of income requisitioned without compensation and does not belong to the category of 'redistribution.' For the same reason, we believe that the terms 'resident tax,' 'income tax,' and 'local tax' also need to be abolished. In the socialist economy, there is no relationship of national income redistribution, which also means that there are no redistribution tools like taxes under capitalist economic conditions. We believe that these terms should be changed to various payments ('turnover payments,' 'agricultural payments,' 'income payments,' etc.)" ("Economic Issues," No. 10, 1954).

Fu. Belkin opposes this statement that denies the existence of any taxes in socialist society. He believes that although the "turnover tax" is not a tax in essence, "resident tax," "income tax," etc. are indeed taxes, because they are not repaid to the taxpayers themselves and are tools for national income redistribution. He said: "Yes, the Soviet working people receive a considerable part of the original income redistribution from the state in the form of monetary assets that can obtain material wealth (annuities, subsidies, etc.). But are the people who receive these assets precisely the individuals and resident groups who pay these assets? ... Take the tax levied on single people and people with few children as an example. Is this tax precisely returned to those residents who pay this tax? Isn't it more correct to say that it is used to pay other residents—people with many children and single mothers? By the way, regarding the class nature of redistribution mentioned by Mo. Paul, it should be pointed out that although a part of national income is redistributed through this tax, it does not have any class tendency" ("Economic Issues," No. 5, 1956).

    关于社会主义社会的国民收入问题在苏联的讨论
    孙耀君
    关于社会主义社会中国民收入的本质、国民收入的创造以及其它有关问题，苏联经济学界早在卫国战争以前就有不同的意见；近几年来，尤其是莫·保尔在苏联“经济问题”杂志1954年第十期发表了“关于社会主义社会的国民收入的几个问题”一文以后，苏联经济学界又就这些问题展开了讨论。现在把这个讨论中所接触到的对于我国学术界有重要参考价值的一些问题作一简单的介绍。
    第一，社会主义社会的国民收入的本质是什么？社会主义社会的国民收入是不是新创造的价值？
    关于这个问题，莫·保尔认为只有在资本主义社会中，社会产品才按照价值分为转移的价值和新创造的价值（国民收入），社会主义社会的国民收入则不是新创造的价值，而是本年内社会必要劳动所新创造的那一部分产品。可是，由于在社会主义社会中还存在着公有制的两种形式，所以国民收入必须采取货币形态和价值形态来计划和计算。他说：“在我们的经济书刊中，往往说苏联的国民收入是新创造的价值。可不可以像对待资本主义社会的国民收入那样确定社会主义社会的国民收入是新创造的价值呢？我们认为是不可以的。说国民收入是新创造的价值，这仅仅反映了资本主义商品生产的特点。……社会主义社会的生产资料实际上没有价值，因而它不能把价值转移到所创造的产品中去。某些经济学家在分析社会主义社会的社会总产品和国民收入时，使用着恰恰是反映资本主义生产特点的“价值”、“转移的价值”和“新创造的价值”等概念（范畴）。……但是，即使社会主义社会的国民收入不是新创造的价值，在社会主义阶段，在国民经济中尚有两个主要生产部门的条件下，国民收入的生产和利用只能借助于货币形态和价值形态来进行计划和计算。至于社会主义社会中的国民收入到底是什么，他认为是“本年内社会必要劳动所新创造的那一部分产品”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）。
    伏·贝尔金批评了上述意见，认为价值不是资本主义商品生产所特有的范畴，它也是社会主义生产的范畴之一。而价值则是由转移的价值和新创造的价值所构成的。他指出：“大家知道，价值不仅是资本主义商品生产的范畴，并且一般是所有商品生产的范畴。只要在苏联还有商品生产，价值规律就发生作用。因此，价值是社会主义生产的范畴之一。为什么在这种情形下价值的组成部分——自生产资料转移的价值和新创造的价值——会是反映资本主义生产的特点呢？只要有价值，它就是由转移的价值和新创造的价值所构成的，这难道不明白吗？……所以，国民收入是代表新创造的价值的那部分社会总产品这一定义，对于社会主义社会也是完全正确的。”（“经济问题”，1956年第5期）此外，德·阿拉赫维尔江也认为，“以价值表现的国民收入，这就是社会新创造出来的价值总额。”（“经济问题”，1954年第2期）
    由于在这个基本问题上看法不同，和基本问题直接联系的其他一些问题也就有了不同的意见。例如：莫·保尔认为，在社会生产过程中，一部分产品和收入要损失掉，这就必须在“创造的国民收入”这一指标之外提出“使用的国民收入”这一指标，他指出：“在编制国民收入的利用和分配计划时所掌握的国民收入总额（或所谓使用的国民收入）少于实际创造的国民收入额，这就是说在社会生产过程中要损失一部分产品和收入。因此，为了进一步检查所创造的国民收入额计算的正确性（因为分配的多少决定于创造的多少）并使产品平衡表和收入平衡表相协调，为了确定苏联劳动人民福利增进情况的主要指标，计算‘使用的国民收入’是具有特殊意义的。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）伏·贝尔金批评了这种意见，认为这是从社会主义社会的国民收入不是新创造的价值这一错误前提得出的错误论点。他认为只要承认国民收入是新创造的价值，那么，就会知道在国民收入的创造过程中发生的一些必要的损耗（如稻谷吹干后分量减轻等）并不会减少国民收入。所以他认为分成两种不同的国民收入指标——创造的国民收入和使用的国民收入是“没有根据的”（“经济问题”，1956年第5期）。
    再如：莫·保尔指出，在国民经济各部门中，有的国民收入不是该部门本身创造的，而是其它部门所创造的国民收入通过该部门的产品实现的。所以他认为，“现在不仅有必要为各部门制定已实现的国民收入的计算方法，而且要判定实际创造的国民收入的计算方法。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）伏·贝尔金对这一问题则指出，只有从国民收入是新创造的价值、各部门中产品的价格和价值的背离出发才能解决这个问题。
    第二，影响社会主义社会的国民收入增长的有哪些因素？社会主义社会的国民收入的增长是不是要按价值和实物量来计算？
    在这个问题上，莫·保尔由于根本否认社会主义社会的国民收入是新创造的价值，所以他认为社会主义社会的国民收入的增长不能按价值和实物量来分别计算，并且反对这样来分析社会主义社会国民收入增长的因素。他指出：“直到现在，许多书刊中还在争论按价值和实物量计算的国民收入增长的因素问题。这种争论的根源就在于非常流行的关于社会主义社会的国民收入是新创造的价值的概念。只有从这个不正确的概念出发，才可以说什么数字演算不单纯是数字游戏，而是一件有益的事。某些统计学教程就是根据这种演算断定说，影响国民收入‘价值’增长的有两个因素——所用工作时间的增加和物资消耗的节约，影响国民收入实物量增长的有三个因素——所用工作时间的增加、劳动生产率的提高和物资消耗的节约。”至于影响社会主义社会国民收入增长的到底是些什么，他认为有两个因素：“第一，是社会生产的增长，而社会生产的增长是受许多因素影响的，例如物质生产部门工作人员的增加，干部熟练程度的提高，在新技术基础上劳动生产率的提高，社会主义竞赛的扩展和天然资源的合理利用等；第二、生产性物资消耗的相对降低。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）
    伏·贝尔金反对这种看法，他指出，可以而且应该分析按价值和实物量计算的国民收入增长的因素。他并指出莫·保尔提出的影响国民收入增长的因素不妥当，如把劳动生产率提高的原因只归结为新技术的采用等。伏·贝尔金又提出了他自己的见解，认为影响国民收入价值量和实物量增长的因素：“国民收入价值量完全只决定于一个因素（而不是两个？）——决定于所用社会劳动的数量（同时要注意到劳动的熟练程度，因为复杂的、熟练的劳动在同一时间内比简单的、不熟练的劳动创造更多的价值）。……国民收入实物量的增长有两个因素：社会劳动生产率的提高和物质生产工作人员的大量增加。”（“经济问题”，1956年第5期）
    第三，社会主义社会的国民收入是由哪些经济部门创造的？社会主义社会的生产部门和非生产部门怎样划分？
    在这个问题上，大家都同意工业、农业、建筑业等是生产部门，是创造国民收入的。发生争论的地方主要在交通运输业和商业这两个部门上。
    莫·保尔认为整个交通运输业都属于生产部门，都是创造国民收入的。他说：“有一些经济学家（伏·索保利、阿·彼得罗夫、阿·巴里采夫）认为，不能把全部交通运输业列入生产领域，而要求只把为生产服务的那一部分交通运输业列入物质生产领域，即把客运和所谓非生产性的交通业除外。我们认为这样解决问题是根本不对的。……个人消费用的工业品和旅客运输业、邮电业产品之间的唯一差别，就在于第一种产品在生产过程完了之后应具有实物形态，而第二种产品却不能与生产过程分开，这种产品就是人的旅行过程本身或邮电业的劳务本身。……在交通运输工业中，消费是和生产本身同时发生的，但这并不能说利用运输工具载运旅客就不是物质生产过程了。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）
    这种意见受到别人的反对，例如伏·贝尔金引述了马克思在“资本论”中和列宁在“俄国资本主义的发展”中的话来说明不能把旅客运输业列入物质生产领域。他指出：“只有那些运送货物的运输业才和其他物质生产部门相同。旅客运输业只提供劳务，因而属于管理和服务的领域。……把旅客运输业和非生产性的交通业列入物质生产领域就会消除社会产品的生产和劳务的提供之间的界限，并使得物质生产领域和管理与服务领域之间不可能作某种明显的划分。”（“经济问题”1956年第5期）
    关于商业是否属于物质生产领域的问题，莫·保尔认为：“在社会主义经济条件下，流通领域的本质以及流通费的本质都发生了根本的变化。但这是不是说，苏维埃商业就成了一个物质生产部门呢？当然不是。商品流通领域内的劳动，在苏联也是非生产性的。在苏联，无论是非生产性劳动的必要性或是这种劳动的组织特点，都不能使这种劳动成为生产性的劳动。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）
    伏·贝尔金则认为纯粹流通费用在苏维埃商业中所占的比重不大，因而不能把社会主义商业部门完全列入非生产部门。他说：“苏联商业的流通费用主要是由对商品所做工作的费用构成的。在苏维埃商业中没有大吹大擂的广告、投机行为、故意的商品毁损以及由于销售不出而形成的特别储存的损耗。马克思把纯粹流通费用规定为由单纯的价值形态变化所产生的费用。在苏联，这种费用的份额是相对地不高的。相应的，和单纯价值形态变化有关的劳动只构成商业中所支付劳动的比较不大的部分。所以，把苏维埃商业完全列入非生产领域是没有任何根据的。”（“经济问题”1956年第五期）
    第四，社会主义的国民收入，除了原始分配以外，有没有再分配？
    关于这个问题，莫·保尔认为社会主义社会的国民收入没有再分配，因为“再分配”这一概念反映的是阶级对抗社会、特别是资本主义社会经济关系的特点。他说：“从社会主义社会的国民收入分配过程看，毫无必要对已经分配的国民收入进行再分配。但是，直到现在，我们的经济著作在说明国民收入的形成、利用和运动时，还使用着‘再分配’这个概念（范畴）。这里指的是通过财政系统（预算、储蓄银行、国家保险）分配国民收入；这与有对抗性矛盾的阶级社会的‘再分配’这一概念的内容有原则性的区别。我们认为，使用这个术语就歪曲了社会主义社会的真正的经济关系。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）
    德·阿拉赫维尔江主张社会主义社会的国民收入有再分配，他指出社会主义制度下的再分配就是“已经分配的一部分国民收入的第二次分配，进行这次分配的结果变更了收入的所有者”（“经济问题”，1954年第2期）。同意这种意见的有伏·贝尔金。他批评莫·保尔道：“保尔同志认为国民收入再分配只是对劳动人民剥削的补充手段并且只限于财政系统的再分配机构，这就人为地歪曲了再分配这个概念。……在物质生产领域之外还有管理和服务领域这一点，就决定了国民收入再分配的必要性。……此外还有社会主义生产两个部分——国家的和合作社集体农庄的——之间的再分配。……应该指出，苏联的国民收入不仅通过莫·保尔指出的财政系统来进行再分配。国民收入再分配还通过买卖劳务和价格机构来实现。”（“经济问题”，1956年第5期）
    同这个问题相联系，产生了社会主义社会中是不是有税收的问题。莫·保尔认为社会主义社会中居民向国家缴纳的款项并不是无偿的，不属于“再分配”的范畴，所以不能叫做税收。他说：“在社会主义经济条件下，居民向国家缴纳款项是不是就意味着居民把自己的一部分收入无偿地交出去了呢？（交给谁呢？）义务缴款，这是表示社会主义社会的每个成员都负担了一部分全国性的费用，如文化和科学事业费、国家管理费和国防费等。在社会主义条件下，这些费用和用于个人需要的费用一样，对劳动人民同样是不可缺少的。……‘周转税’这个不合理的术语是要废除的，但并不是因为周转税不改变所有者，而是因为这笔款项不是税，即不是无偿地征用的一部分收入，不属于‘再分配’的范畴。根据同一理由，我们认为‘居民税’、‘所得税’和‘地方税’这些术语也需要废除。在社会主义经济中，没有国民收入再分配的关系，这也就表示没有像在资本主义经济条件下的捐税那样的再分配工具。我们认为这些术语应该改称为各种缴款（“周转缴款”、“农业缴款”、“所得缴款”等等）。”（“经济问题”，1954年第10期）
    伏·贝尔金反对这种否认在社会主义社会中有任何税收的说法。他认为“周转税”固然从实质上讲不是税，可是“居民税”、“所得税”等却的确是税，因为它们并不偿还给纳税者本人，是国民收入再分配的工具。他说：“是的，苏联劳动人民用可以获得物质财富的货币资财形式（年金、津贴等），从国家获得到原始收入再分配中相当大的部分。可是得到这些资财的人，难道正是缴纳这些资财的个人和居民集团吗？……试以对独身者和少子女者所征的税为例。难道这种税正是还给缴纳这种税的那些居民吗？说它在某种程度上被利用来付给其它一些居民——多子女者和独身母亲不是更正确些吗？顺便提到，关于莫·保尔所说的再分配的阶级性质，应该指出，虽然通过这种税再分配了一部分国民收入，却并不具有任何阶级倾向性。”（“经济问题”，1956年第5期）
