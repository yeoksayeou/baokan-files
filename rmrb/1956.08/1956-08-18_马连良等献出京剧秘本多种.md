    Ma Lianliang and Others Donate Various Peking Opera Secret Texts
    (Our newspaper reports) Renowned Peking Opera actor Ma Lianliang recently made public 162 Peking Opera secret texts from his personal collection. These scripts are currently being sorted by the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Directing Committee. Some of the more complete traditional plays will be edited and published successively before the end of this year.
    Ma Lianliang, since he was a student in the Fu Liancheng Opera School, has loved collecting good scripts from veteran actors. For forty years, he has tirelessly sought, copied, sorted, and preserved these valuable legacies left by the veteran artists. Among them, plays like "Qingfeng Pavilion" and "Lintong Mountain," after being sorted by himself, have become frequently performed plays for decades. In these secret texts, some are scripts copied in the seventh year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty. These plays were popular and widely performed during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, becoming a sensation for a time. They are the oldest Peking Opera scripts and valuable Peking Opera documents currently circulating, from which we can see how Peking Opera integrated Luan Tan, absorbed Kunqu opera tunes, and evolved into today's comprehensive art form. Among them, "Visiting Pu in the Snowy Night," "Selling Huashan," "Double Street Performance," and "Dengyun Ridge" are all good plays that can be performed with slight adjustments.
    Peking Opera actors Mao Shilai, Zhao Yanxia, Liu Wenkui, and others have also recently sent some of their personally collected opera scripts to the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Directing Committee. (Steel)

### 马连良等献出京剧秘本多种

    马连良等献出京剧秘本多种
    本报讯　著名京剧演员马连良，最近把家藏的162本京剧秘本公布。这些剧本，现在正由北京市戏曲编导委员会分别整理，其中较完整的一些传统剧目，将在今年年底以前陆续编辑出版。
    马连良从在富连成科班做学生的时候起，就爱搜藏前辈老伶工的好剧本。四十年来不懈的搜求、抄录和整理、保留了这些前辈艺人留下来的宝贵遗产。其中像“青风亭”、“临潼山”等戏、经过他自己整理以后，成了几十年来经常上演的剧目。在这些秘本里面，有一部分是清道光七年抄写的脚本。这些戏在嘉庆、道光年间流行演出，风靡一时，是目前流传的最老的京剧剧本和宝贵的京剧文献，从中可以看出京剧是怎样融合乱弹、吸收昆曲牌令，演变成为今天这样的综合艺术的。其中像“雪夜访普”、“卖华山”、“双卖艺”、“登云岭”等都是稍加整理就可演出的好戏。
    毛世来、赵燕侠、刘文魁等京剧演员，最近也把一部分家藏戏曲剧本送到北京市戏曲编导委员会。　（钢）
