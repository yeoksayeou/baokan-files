Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Due to the recent typhoon, the North China region has experienced widespread heavy rainfall in various river basins. Over the past two days, Hejian in the Wei River basin received 322.7 mm of rainfall, and Tuquan received 228.1 mm; Guantai station on the Zhang River received 146.2 mm, and Yantou Village received 138.3 mm; Qingbaikou on the Yongding River received 257.9 mm, Sanjiadian received 221.9 mm, and Lugouqiao received 143.4 mm. Other rivers, such as the Chaobai River, Jiyun River, and the upper reaches of the Hutuo River, have also experienced heavy or even torrential rainfall.

The water levels of North China rivers have risen sharply. At Lugouqiao station on the Yongding River, the peak flood level reached 65.15 meters at 20:50 on the 3rd, with a flow rate of 2,430 cubic meters per second. Near Lugouqiao, the Xia Qing River on the right bank overflowed at 20:00 on the 3rd, with floodwaters from the Yongding River diverting into the Xiaoqing River, creating a tense flood situation. Qian Zhengying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, rushed to Lugouqiao that night to guide flood control efforts. Currently, the water level has begun to recede. By 14:00 on the 4th, the water level had dropped to 63.07 meters, and the flow rate had decreased to 674 cubic meters per second. Daxing County and Anci County along the Yongding River have strengthened their defenses. Members of the CCP county committees, county heads, cadres, and laborers are working wholeheartedly to protect the dikes and carry out emergency repairs.

The flood situation on the Zhang River and Wei River has entered its most critical phase. At Guantai station on the Zhang River, the peak flood level reached 157.38 meters at 1:15 on the 4th, with a flow rate as high as 8,600 cubic meters per second. At Chu Wang on the Wei River, the flow rate had reached 560 cubic meters per second by 11:00 on the 4th. Breaches have occurred on both the north and south banks of the Zhang River within Weixian County, Hebei Province, with the breach on the north bank currently being repaired.

The Hutuo River's water level has risen sharply. At Huangbizhuang, the peak flood flow reached as high as 11,500 cubic meters per second at 9:20 on the 4th. Communication with the Hongzidian and Zhengding hydrological stations has been cut off. The Beijing-Hankou Railway is currently closed to traffic.

Currently, the majority of the 500,000-strong emergency response teams along the five major river systems in Hebei Province have been deployed to the dikes. Leading cadres at all levels are on the dikes directing flood control and emergency repairs, fighting tenaciously against the flood in the spirit of "raising the dikes as the water rises." County heads and CCP county committee secretaries, along with a large number of cadres from counties such as Boye and Gaoyang, rushed to the Zhulong River area on the night of the 3rd. At present, key dangerous sections are under the specific guidance of a CCP county committee member, responsible for emergency repair and dike protection. Emergency teams are stationed every meter along the hundreds of miles of river dikes.

Hebei Province has organized its flood prevention teams very well this year. Before the flood season, over two thousand flood control headquarters at all levels were established in the river areas. A million-strong flood control team was organized, and potential dike hazards were inspected and eliminated using drilling and ramming methods. At the same time, a large number of wooden stakes, reeds, grass bags, hemp ropes, and other flood control and emergency repair materials were prepared.

    华北各河流水势猛涨
    五十万防汛人员上堤抢险
    新华社4日讯　华北地区由于受到最近一次台风的影响，各河流域普降暴雨。两天来，卫河合涧共降雨322.7公厘，土圈228.1公厘；漳河观台站146.2公厘，沿头村138.3公厘；永定河青白口257.9公厘，三家店221.9公厘，芦沟桥143.4公厘，其他河流如潮白河、蓟运河、滹沱河上游也都降了大雨甚至暴雨。
    华北各河水势猛涨。永定河芦沟桥站三日二十时五十分洪峰水位涨达65.15公尺，流量2，430秒公方，芦沟桥附近右岸小清河三日二十时，已漫堤过水，永定河水分洪入小清河，汛情甚为紧张。水利部副部长钱正英当日夜赶赴芦沟桥指导防汛工作。目前水势已转落，四日十四时，水位退到63.07公尺，流量减少到674秒公方。永定河沿河大兴县和安次县都已加强防守。这两个县的中共县委委员、县长、干部和民工全力以赴护堤抢险。
    漳河、卫河汛情已进入最紧张阶段。漳河观台站四日一时十五分洪峰水位涨达157.38公尺，流量高达8，600秒公方；卫河楚旺四日十一时流量已达560秒公方。河北魏县境内漳河北岸和南岸都发生决口，北岸一处正抢堵中。
    滹沱河水势猛涨。黄壁庄四日九时二十分，洪峰流量高达11，500秒公方，洪子店、正定水文站电讯已断联系。京汉铁路目前已不通车。
    现在，河北省五大河系沿河五十万名抢险队员已大部上堤。各级领导干部大都在堤上指挥防汛抢险，本着“水涨堤高”的精神与洪水顽强搏斗。博野高阳等县县长和中共县委书记和大批干部，三日夜就赶到猪龙河地区，目前各重要险工地段，都有一个中共县委委员负责具体指导抢险护堤。沿河数百里的河堤上每一公尺均有一抢险队员把守。
    河北省今年防汛队伍组织得非常好。汛前沿河地区即建立起两千多处各级防汛指挥部，组织起百万人的防汛队伍并用钻探夯砸等方法检查和消除了堤防隐患，同时还准备了大批木桩苇料草袋麻绳等防汛抢险的物资。
