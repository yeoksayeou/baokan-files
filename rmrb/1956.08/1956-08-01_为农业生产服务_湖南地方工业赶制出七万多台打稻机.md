    Serving Agricultural Production
    Local Industries in Hunan Province Rush to Produce Over 70,000 Rice Threshers
    (Our dispatch) Hunan Province's local industries, in order to support agriculture's "catching up with autumn harvest," have already rushed to produce over 70,000 rice threshers.
    As early as last year, Hunan Province's local industries trial-produced 500 such rice threshers. After testing, they were very popular with farmers. Using this type of rice thresher to thresh japonica rice can increase work efficiency by about one time compared to using the old-fashioned rice-beating tubs. Using it to thresh indica rice can also increase work efficiency by 25%-50%. Moreover, women and semi-able-bodied laborers can use it. An even greater advantage of this rice thresher is that it threshes cleanly, generally reducing grain loss by about 13 jin per mu. If all early rice in the province is threshed using rice threshers this year, farmers can increase their income by more than 180 million jin of rice (the early rice fields in the province total more than 14 million mu).
    The more than 70,000 rice threshers produced by Hunan Province's local industries this year were all manufactured according to the unified designs provided by the Provincial Department of Industry. Based on last year's trial results, many improvements have been made this year. For example, the hardness of important parts such as the gears and drum baffles of the rice thresher has been increased, making them more durable. All parts are required to be replaceable, making it easy for rural areas to repair and maintain them. Currently, these rice threshers are being continuously transported to rural areas. The Provincial Department of Industry, the Bureau of Handicraft Industry, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative have recently jointly organized observation groups to go to rural areas to understand the use of rice threshers and solicit farmers' opinions in order to continuously improve them.

    为农业生产服务
    湖南地方工业赶制出七万多台打稻机
    本报讯　湖南省地方工业为了支援农业“赶秋”，已经赶制出七万多台打稻机。
    还在去年，湖南省地方工业就试制了五百台这样的打稻机，经过试验，很受农民欢迎。用这种打稻机打粳稻，比使用旧式扮禾桶能提高工作效率一倍左右；用它打籼稻，工作效率也能提高25％—50％。而且妇女、半劳动力都能使用。这种打稻机更大的优点是脱粒干净，每亩田一般能减少稻谷损耗十三斤左右。今年全省早稻如果都用打稻机脱粒，就可以使农民增加一亿八千多万斤稻谷的收入（全省早稻田为一千四百多万亩）。
    湖南省地方工业今年制成的七万多台打稻机都是按照省工业厅统一设计的图纸制造的。根据去年试验的情况，今年的又作了许多改进。如打稻机的齿轮、滚筒挡板等重要零件都提高了硬度，更能耐用。全部零件都要求能够更换，便于农村进行修配。目前，这些打稻机正源源地运往农村。省工业厅、手工业局、供销社等单位最近联合组织了观察组，到农村了解打稻机使用情况，征求农民意见，以便不断改进。　（黄远溟）
