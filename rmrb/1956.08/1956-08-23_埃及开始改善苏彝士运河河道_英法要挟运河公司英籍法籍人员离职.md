Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd dispatch from Washington: The Egyptian Embassy in Washington announced on August 21st that Egypt has begun to improve the channel of the Suez Canal.

The statement issued by the embassy said: "The technical departments of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority have completed surveys of the canal's current efficiency and the development projects necessary to deepen and widen the waterway to cope with future shipping (especially supertankers).

"The Canal Authority has also decided to carry out the currently needed development work, with the aim of better and more properly serving today's shipping."

Since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, the West has consistently propagated that this would damage the maintenance and improvement of the canal's technical equipment, and therefore it is necessary to "internationalize" the canal.

Xinhua News Agency, August 21st dispatch from London: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 20th that the former Suez Canal Company has notified its staff not to sign any statements indicating that they have not entered into contracts inconsistent with continuing to work for the nationalized Canal Company. The spokesman announced: "The British government fully agrees with this advice."

It is said that the Egyptian authorities had requested the Suez Canal Company's employees to sign this statement on August 18th.

There are currently reports that the West is plotting to create excuses for using military pressure against Egypt by obstructing the smooth passage of the canal.

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd dispatch from Cairo: Mahmoud Younis, Chairman of the Egyptian Suez Canal Management Committee, accused French Consul in Port Said, Brenac, on the evening of August 20th of inducing French pilots not to work for the Egyptian canal management organization.

Younis accused Brenac of "influencing French pilots regardless of diplomatic etiquette." He said, "Some French pilots have been forced under pressure to sign documents loyal to the old Suez Canal Company."

Younis pointed out that although some French pilots have signed this document, they are still working for the Egyptian canal management organization. He said that as long as they continue to work, they will not be punished.

Younis said that so far, twenty-six foreign pilots have gone to Europe for vacation and have not returned to their posts. He said, "We have appointed twenty-six new pilots to replace them. The new pilots include Germans, Greeks, Egyptians, one Frenchman, and two Britons."

    埃及开始改善苏彝士运河河道
    英法要挟运河公司英籍法籍人员离职
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及驻华盛顿大使馆八月二十一日宣布，埃及已经着手改善苏彝士运河的河道。
    大使馆发表的声明说：“埃及苏彝士运河管理局的技术部门已经结束了对目前运河的效率和加深及加宽这条水道以应付今后的航运（特别是超级油船）这种必要的发展工程所进行的勘察。
    “运河当局还已经决定进行当前需要的发展工作，目的在于更好、更妥善地为今天的航运服务。”
    埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后，西方一向宣传这将损害运河技术设备的维护和改善，因此必须使运河“国际化”。
    新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人八月二十日说，前苏彝士运河公司已经通知它的工作人员，要他们不要签署任何声明，来表明自己并没有订定同继续留在收归国有的运河公司任职这件事不相容的合同。这个发言人宣布：“英国政府完全同意这种劝告”。
    据说埃及当局曾经在八月十八日要求苏彝士运河公司的职员签署这个声明。
    目前有消息说，西方阴谋用阻挠运河顺利通航的办法来制造借口以便对埃及使用军事压力。
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：埃及苏彝士运河管理委员会主席马哈茂德·尤尼斯八月二十日晚指责法国驻塞得港领事布雷纳克诱骗法籍领港员不为埃及的运河管理机构工作。
    尤尼斯指责布雷纳克“不顾外交礼节而影响法籍领港员”。他说，“有些法籍领港员已经在压力下被迫签署了忠于旧的苏彝士运河公司的文件”。
    尤尼斯指出，尽管有些法籍领港员在这个文件上签了字，但是他们还继续为埃及的运河管理机构工作。他说，只要他们继续工作，他们是不会受到处分的。
    尤尼斯说，到目前为止，有二十六名外国领港员赴欧洲度假期还没有返职。他说，“我们已经任命二十六名新的领港员来接替他们。新的领港员有德国人、希腊人、埃及人、一个法国人和两个英国人。”
