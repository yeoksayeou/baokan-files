Knowledge Comes from Hard Study
By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union

    At six o'clock in the afternoon on May 18, 1956, the meeting hall of the Leningrad Institute of Engineering, named after Kalinin, was filled with people who had come to attend the defense of the doctoral dissertation of Gao Jingde, a Chinese graduate student studying in the Soviet Union. There were four examiners here. They were authorities in the field of electrical engineering, had reviewed Gao Jingde's dissertation in advance, made evaluations, and were prepared to present their opinions and debate with Gao Jingde on the spot. Therefore, in Russian, the examiners are called "opponents." There were professors, directors, Party committee secretaries, secretaries of academic conferences, and other members of academic conferences. There were Soviet graduate students, undergraduates, and Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union.
    This dissertation defense was a first for Gao Jingde, a 34-year-old native of northern Shaanxi, and unprecedented for many Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. The event was very exciting. You see, Gao Jingde was not only the first Chinese student in the Soviet Union to earn a doctoral degree, but he also earned it by skipping a level. His prepared candidate's dissertation, "The Influence of Motors and Their Parameters in Long-Distance Power Transmission Systems," surpassed the level of a candidate's degree and, after in-depth research, was written as a doctoral dissertation, "Research on Salient-Pole Synchronous Motors Applied in Long-Distance Power Transmission Systems." This dissertation had been printed and distributed several months earlier.
    On this day, the examiners asked Gao Jingde various questions. Countless pairs of eyes were watching this tall Chinese student wearing glasses. Many professors and students were worried about him. One examiner praised his dissertation as meeting doctoral standards, good. Another examiner believed that his mathematical algorithms had shortcomings. The third examiner agreed to award him a doctoral degree. The fourth examiner said that his dissertation did exceed the level of a candidate's degree, but made no further comments. Gao Jingde himself remained very calm. His scientific research in recent years had taught him that knowledge gained through hard study should be like gold that can withstand fire. He explained and defended. The debate lasted for four hours. The examiner who had held a skeptical attitude had no more objections, and the examiner who had not fully expressed his attitude also agreed to award him a doctoral degree. Finally, each member of the academic conference cast two votes at the same time: one for the candidate's degree and one for the doctoral degree. Everyone voted in favor of awarding Gao Jingde a candidate's degree, and four-fifths also voted in favor of awarding him a doctoral degree. In a socialist society, a degree is a sign that one's knowledge has reached a certain level, and it is not based on favoritism. As long as you have genuine talent and learning, you will earn it with a clear conscience.
    After being approved by the academic conference of the Kalinin Institute of Engineering and the All-Soviet Degree Qualification Examination Committee, Gao Jingde received the degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences. This was something that Gao Jingde had never dreamed of when he was a student at Jiaxian Primary School, Yulin Middle School, and Wugong Northwest Institute of Technology, when he was a teaching assistant at the Peking University Institute of Engineering, or even when he first arrived in the Soviet Union. Of course, Gao Jingde was not without ideals in his youth. Before liberation, he also wanted to master technology, believing that mastering technology would enable him to get things done well. Therefore, he studied diligently under a small oil lamp at Northwest Institute of Technology. However, the empty life and work at the Xi'an Power Plant after graduation made him realize how far reality was from his ideals. So he preferred to go to the Peiping branch of the Beiyang Institute of Technology as a poor teaching assistant, entrusting his spirit to books. However, the earth-shattering revolutionary tide of the people shattered his view of not asking about politics and doing science for science's sake. The Communist Party made him realize the relationship between science and politics; made him understand that only in the people's country can scientists and technicians use their knowledge to serve the people.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China and the relationship of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union gave thousands upon thousands of young people in our country the opportunity to study in the Soviet Union. Gao Jingde was one of them. When he first arrived in the Soviet Union as a graduate student in the autumn of 1951, he did not know a single word of Russian. After studying Russian for half a year, he was able to roughly understand technical books in his field. Only then did he go to see his supervising professor, Kostianko. In general, Soviet professors are very happy to have Chinese students in their departments; Kostianko had also been to China, so he received Gao Jingde with particular enthusiasm and helped him develop a research plan. In the Soviet Union, some teachers only give their students Russian reference books. Kostianko was not like that. This professor knew that Gao Jingde understood English, and the technical books he assigned to him were both in Russian and English.
    In this way, Gao Jingde formally began his studies as a graduate student in electrical engineering, which was already the spring of 1952. Research, exams, internships... everything proceeded as usual. During the second professional exam, he wrote a paper similar to an academic thesis as an examination work on motor theory. Professor Kostianko was very satisfied and asked him, "Do you want to finish your studies quickly or slowly?" Gao Jingde replied, "Of course, I want to finish quickly. Because the motherland is waiting for people to use." So, it was discussed to shorten the graduate study period by half a year and begin preparing a candidate's degree dissertation. What topic should he choose? Gao Jingde himself did not know. Kostianko suggested to him, "China is a big country. Long-distance power transmission will definitely develop greatly in the future. I want to train you to be a talent in this area." In this way, Gao Jingde chose a larger topic about motors in long-distance power transmission systems. After doing some research, he ran to the professor for advice again. Kostianko saw that he was a talent who could be developed in depth, and said to him, "I'm busy and have very little time to think carefully about problems. I think you must also be busy when you go back and won't have time to delve deeply. How about this, you extend the time you originally had to write your candidate's dissertation by half a year, and write the same topic as a doctoral dissertation." Gao Jingde accepted this suggestion. In the Soviet Union, graduate students generally spend three years earning a candidate's degree, and after working for several years, they need to spend another two years earning a doctoral degree. But Kostianko believed that Gao Jingde could grow from an ordinary graduate student to a doctor in four to four and a half years, and guided and encouraged him step by step. Was this because the professor had the ability to recognize talent, or because he had a warm heart for cultivating talent for China? It should be said that both are true.
    In order not to disappoint the hopes of the motherland, Gao Jingde knew that he had to study even harder. Surrounding the research problem, he tried to read as much information as possible. Russian; English, different viewpoints, he read everything he could get his hands on. The material is not as simple and clear as textbooks, and it is sometimes very difficult to read. When there were things he didn't understand, he had to consult other books. This was the initial stage. After some time, he felt that many viewpoints were interconnected. The more he read, the faster he read, and the more he would extract the essence from the vast chapters.
    He read continuously for five months and sorted out the materials he had read. He felt that sorting out the materials helped him find the connection and system of knowledge, and摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸摸
    On the basis of occupying the materials, he used his brains diligently to think more. From hard study and research, Gao Jingde discovered new things. Originally, the main methods for improving motors in long-distance power transmission systems were to change variables or change coordinate axes. After sorting out and systematizing the existing methods of changing variables or changing axes, he discovered that there was another method of changing variables that could be used to study the problem, and therefore created the basic equation of the synchronous motor under this axis. He tried to use his new equation to solve the problems that others had solved with other equations, and it was solved easily. This confirmed the correctness and function of the new equation. He further used this equation to solve problems that others had not solved, and it worked every time. This research lasted for seven months. This constitutes the theoretical part of his dissertation.
    At this time, the Soviet supervisor believed that the theoretical part of Gao Jingde's dissertation was enough, and proposed some new questions for him to experiment with, saying: "We are not satisfied with cultivating qualified talents, but we want to cultivate more comprehensive talents, including those who can experiment." At first, the experiments were carried out in the laboratory of the Kalinin Institute of Technology. The equipment there was not yet sufficient, and the experiments were difficult, but he became skilled. Experiments were often interrupted because the equipment was not available. He made full use of the gaps to analyze experimental methods and other related theoretical issues. After a month or two, formal experiments were carried out in the experimental institute affiliated to the Academy of Sciences. With theoretical preparation and thinking during the practice, he truly achieved using theory to guide experiments. In the experiment, most of the expected results were achieved, and the deviations were quickly corrected. The formal experiment was completed after two months.
    By May 1955, all the materials for the doctoral dissertation were available. Gao Jingde spent four months sorting out these materials and wrote the first draft of the dissertation in early September. The professor read the first draft, made some revisions based on the professor's opinions, paid for printing in October, and sent it out in December. In this way, from the beginning of 1952 to the end of 1955, Gao Jingde completed his doctoral studies in four years. This was considered impossible by some people who were more ideologically conservative at the beginning. They said, "We don't even have the level of graduate students, how can we get a doctoral degree?"
    Earning a doctoral degree is just the beginning of scientific research work. Gao Jingde repeatedly expressed this point to me. He said: "Often I see some comrades who are doing scientific research work afraid of taking detours. They should only consider whether a certain research is useful to the country, and not be afraid of taking detours. Of course, they should pay attention to taking fewer detours, and turn around as soon as possible when they take a detour. Don't be afraid of taking detours and not walking."

    学问得自苦学中
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    1956年5月18日下午六时，列宁格勒以加里宁为名的工程学院的会议厅里聚集了许多人，他们是来参加中国留苏研究生高景德的学位论文答辩会的。这里有四位主试人。他们是电机专业的权威，事先审阅了高景德的论文，作出了评价，准备当场提出自己的意见和高景德辩论，所以俄文把主试人叫做“论敌”。这里有专业的教授、主任、党委书记、学术会议秘书和学术会议的其他委员。这里有苏联的研究生、大学生和中国的留学生。
    这次学位论文答辩会对于三十四岁的陕北人高景德是生平第一次，对于许多中国留苏研究生也是空前的。事情很令人兴奋。你看，高景德不但是第一个考取博士学位的中国留苏学生，而且他是越级考取的。他准备的副博士论文“远距离输电系统中的电机及其参数的影响”，越过了副博士水平，经过深入研究，写成了博士论文“应用于远距离输电系统中的凸极同步电机研究”。这篇论文在几个月以前已经印发了。
    这一天，主试人向高景德提出了各种问题。多少双眼睛瞧着这位戴眼镜的高个子的中国留学生。多少教授和同学为他担心。一位主试人赞许他的论文够博士标准，好。另一位主试人认为他的数学算法有缺点。第三个主试人同意给他博士学位。第四个主试人说他的论文确实超过了副博士水平，但是没有进一步的评语。高景德自己很沉住气。这几年科学研究使他知道，从苦学中得到的学问，应当像金子经得住火烧。他解释了，答辩了。辩论进行了四个小时。抱着怀疑态度的那位主试人没有意见了，没有彻底表示态度的那位主试人也赞成给他博士学位了。最后，学术会议的每个委员同时投了两张票：一张关于副博士的，一张关于博士的。全部赞成给高景德副博士学位，其中五分之四同时赞成给他博士学位。在社会主义社会里，学位是学问达到一定水平的标志，它是不徇私情的。只要你有真才实学，你会无愧于衷地得到它。
    经过加里宁工程学院学术会议和全苏学位资格审查委员会批准以后，高景德得到了技术科学博士的学位。这是高景德在葭县小学、榆林中学、武功西北工学院当学生的时候，在北京大学工学院当助教的时候，甚至在初到苏联的时候，都没有梦想到的。当然，高景德在年青时代不是没有理想的。在解放以前，他也想把技术学好，满以为学好技术就能够把事情办好。因此他在西北工学院小油灯下刻苦地念过书。但是毕业后在西安电厂的一段空洞的生活和工作，使他觉得现实距离理想多么遥远。所以他宁肯跑到当时北洋工学院北平分部做个清寒的助教，把精神寄托在书本里。可是人民翻天复地的革命浪潮，打破了他那不问政治、为科学而科学的观点。共产党使他认识到科学和政治的关系；使他懂得了，只有在人民的国家里，科学和技术工作者才能够施展所学为人民服务。
    中华人民共和国的成立和中苏友好合作的关系，使我国成千累百青年得到了留学苏联的机会。高景德也是其中一个。他在1951年秋天才到苏联当研究生的时候，俄文一字不识。专门学了半年俄文，他能够粗懂本门技术书籍了。这时才去见了指导教授科斯田科。一般苏联教授都很高兴自己科门有中国学生；科斯田科又到过中国，所以特别热诚地接待了高景德，帮助了他制定研究的计划。在苏联有的先生给自己的学生只列俄文参考书。科斯田科不是这样。这位教授知道高景德懂英文，给他指定的技术书籍有俄文的也有英文的。
    这样，高景德正式开始了电机专业研究生的学习生活，那已经是1952年春天了。研究、考试、实习……一切照常进行着。第二次专业考试的时候，他写了一篇类似学术论文的论文作为电机理论的应试作品。科斯田科教授很满意，问他：“你要快学完呢还是要慢学完？”高景德回答：“当然要快。因为祖国等待用人。”于是，商量了把研究生的期限缩短半年，开始了准备副博士学位论文。选什么题目呢？高景德自己也不知道。科斯田科替他出了主意说：“中国是个大国。远距离输电将来一定会大发展。想把你培养成这方面的人材。”这样，高景德选了关于远距离输电系统中的电机的较大题目。作了一番研究工作以后，他又跑到教授那里请教。科斯田科看出了他是可以深造人材，就又对他说：“我忙，连仔细思考问题的时间都很少。我想，你回去后一定也忙，不得空深造。这样吧，你把原来写副博士论文的时间延长半年，把同样内容的题目写成博士论文。”高景德接受了这个建议。在苏联，一般研究生用三年功夫考取副博士学位，工作若干年以后，还要用两年功夫考取博士学位。而科斯田科相信高景德能够在四年到四年半期间从普通研究生成长成博士，而且一步步指引他，鼓励他。这是因为这位教授有知人之明呢，还是因为他有一付为中国培养人材的热心肠呢？应该说，两者都有吧。
    为了不辜负祖国的希望，高景德知道，必须更加刻苦地钻研。围绕着研究的问题，他尽量多读资料。俄文的；英文的，不同观点的，能找到手都读。资料不比教科书，没有那么简单明了，阅读起来有时很费劲，不懂的地方要查考别的书籍。这是最初阶段。过了一些时候，他觉得许多观点是互相贯通的。他越读多了，越读得快，也越会从浩瀚的篇章中去糟取精了。
    他连续读了五个月资料，把所读的资料整理了一遍。他觉得，整理资料帮助了他找到了学问的联系和系统，从原先看来是混乱一片的问题中摸出了几条清楚的道路。
    在占有材料的基础上，他勤动脑筋多思考。从苦学和钻研中，高景德发现了新的东西。本来，远距离输电系统中电机改进的主要方法是换变数或者换座标轴。他把现有的换变数或者换轴的各种方法加以整理和系统化以后，发现还有一种换变数法可以利用来研究问题，因此创造了同步电机在这个轴下的基本方程式。他试用自己的新方程式，迎刃而解地解决了别人用别的方程式所解决的问题。这证实新方程式的正确和作用。他进一步用这个方程式解决别人没有解决的问题，也是百试不爽。这一段研究进行了七个月。这构成他的论文的理论部分。
    到了这个时候，苏联指导教授认为高景德论文的理论部分已经够了，提出了一些新的问题给他作实验，说：“我们不以培养够标准的人材为满足，而要培养更全面的，包括会实验的人材。”起初，实验就在加里宁工学院的实验室里进行。那里设备还不充足，实验有困难，但是练熟了手。实验时常因为设备不得空而中断。他充分利用空隙来分析实验的方法和其他有关理论的问题。过了个把月，在科学院所属的实验所进行了正式的实验。有理论准备，在练手时候又思考过，所以他真正做到了用理论指导实验。在实验中绝大部分达到了预期的结果，出偏差的部分也很快被纠正过来了。正式实验经过两个月完成了。
    到1955年5月，博士论文的全部材料都有了。高景德用四个月时间整理了这些材料，在九月初写出了论文初稿。初稿经教授看过，根据教授的意见作了一些修改，十月付印，十二月发出。这样，从1952年初到1955年底，高景德以四年功夫完成了博士的学业。这是当初有些思想比较保守的人们认为不可能的，他们说：“我们连研究生的水平都不够，考取什么博士学位？”
    博士学位的考取，只是做科学研究工作的开始。高景德一再对我表示这一点。他说：“往往看见做科学研究工作的某些同志怕走弯路。应该只考虑一种研究对国家有无用处，而不要怕走弯路。自然，要注意少走弯路，走上弯路时及早扭转。不要怕走弯路而不走路。”
