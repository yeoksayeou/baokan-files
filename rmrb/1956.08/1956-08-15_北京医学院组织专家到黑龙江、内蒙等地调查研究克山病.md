Xinhua News Agency, August 14th. From July 31st to August 13th, Beijing Medical College has dispatched three groups of experts to Beian area of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin and Hebei to investigate the occurrence of Keshan disease in these areas.

    These experts include Professor Ma Wansen, an expert in internal medicine and cardiology, Professor Li Xigan, an expert in bacteriology, Professor Fang Liang, an expert in microbiology, Associate Professor Zhu Dan, an expert in epidemiology, and Associate Professor Zhao Zhensheng, an expert in parasitology. The investigation team is led by Hu Chuan Kui, President of Beijing Medical College.

    Since 1953, the Ministry of Health has entrusted Harbin Medical College to conduct systematic investigations and research on Keshan disease. On August 6th this year, Harbin Medical College, led by Professor Sun Xipu, director of the Department of Public Health, formed four investigation groups focusing on hygiene and epidemiology, diet, rodent density and drinking water, and went to Beian area to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the incidence of Keshan disease, in order to further clarify the causes and understand the patterns of the disease.

    Keshan disease is a regional endemic disease with strict geographical limitations. It has been found in seven provinces in China, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu and Liaoning. In some places, it has long threatened people's lives. Keshan disease occurs in winter and spring. Patients with acute Keshan disease feel uncomfortable in their hearts, have cold limbs, feel dizzy, and can die within hours. Clinical symptoms include cardiomegaly, arrhythmia, and cyanosis. Patients with chronic Keshan disease (non-acute) also have edema in the lower extremities when the disease occurs.

    Up to now, experts have many different views on the cause of Keshan disease. Some believe that it is due to poor local water quality, or chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, while others believe that it is caused by bacterial or viral infections, or fungal poisoning.

    北京医学院组织专家到黑龙江、内蒙等地调查研究克山病
    新华社14日讯　从七月三十一日到八月十三日，北京医学院已经有三批专家分别出发到黑龙江北安地区、内蒙古、吉林和河北等地调查当地克山病的发生情况。
    这些专家有内科心脏病专家马万森教授、细菌学专家黎希干教授、微生物学专家方亮教授、流行病学专家朱聃副教授、寄生虫学专家赵振声副教授等。调查组由北京医学院院长胡传揆带领。
    从1953年以来，卫生部就责成哈尔滨医学院对克山病作系统的调查研究。今年八月六日，哈尔滨医学院在公共卫生系主任孙锡璞教授带领下，又组成卫生流行病学、膳食、鼠类密度和饮水等四个调查组，赴北安地区，对克山病的发病情况作综合调查，以进一步明确发病原因，了解发病规律。
    克山病是一种有严格地区性的地方病，在我国黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、河北、陕西、甘肃和辽宁等七个省都曾发现过，有的地方长期威胁着人民的生命。克山病在冬春两季发生。急性克山病的患者，感到心里难受，四肢发冷，头脑发昏，在数小时内就可死去。临床症状是心脏扩大、心律不齐，皮肤青紫。痨型克山病（非急性）患者发病时下肢还浮肿。
    专家们到现在为止，对克山病的病因还有很多不同见解。有的认为是由于当地水质不良，或由于一氧化碳慢性中毒所致，有的认为是因为细菌或病毒传染的，也有的认为是真菌中毒。
