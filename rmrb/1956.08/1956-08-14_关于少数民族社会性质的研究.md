Research on the nature of society of various minority nationalities is an important task for ethnology in our country at present, and it will also be the central work for a period of time to come. At present, various minority nationalities are undergoing or are about to undergo socialist transformation, and in the matter of socialist transformation, as stipulated in the Preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, full attention will be paid to the characteristics of the development of various nationalities. The purpose of the research on the nature of society of various nationalities is to clarify the characteristics of their development, therefore, this research is closely combined with the current nationality work.

This research will also enrich our knowledge of the history of social development and enrich the content of historical materialism. Moreover, most of our current teaching materials on the history of social development rely on translations. For example, the original society cites Morgan's investigation, and the slave society cites Greece and Rome as examples. These materials are of course extremely important, but they are relatively unfamiliar to the general readers in our country, thus limiting the dissemination of knowledge of this science. In fact, our country has rich materials in this respect. Before the democratic reform and socialist transformation, many of the minority nationalities in our country had not yet entered the stage of capitalism, so they still retained, to varying degrees, the features or remnants of various social forms in the pre-capitalist period. The investigation of the nature of society of various minority nationalities will record and collect materials related to various social forms for us, and these are also vivid teaching materials for the history of social development.

It must be pointed out that because various minority nationalities are undergoing or will rapidly undergo socialist transformation, if we do not record their faces before the transformation in time, we will soon lose the opportunity for direct observation. Therefore, this research should also be regarded as an urgent task.

Now we can use the existing, but not systematic and in-depth, materials to give examples of what different social forms existed among the minority nationalities in our country before the democratic reform and socialist transformation:

(1) Types with Primitive Social Forms

The Oroqen people in the forests of the Great Khingan Mountains in Northeast China are an example of this form. They mainly rely on hunting for a living, and their production tools are very simple. A long time ago, they used self-made bows and arrows for hunting. Around 1920, various guns were used extensively. During the interval of seasonal hunting, they also engage in fishing. Life is nomadic and uncertain.

Their relations of production are basically clan communal ownership of land, joint labor, and equal distribution. Their fishing grounds and hunting grounds are only allowed to be used by their own clan members. Everyone participates in labor. To this day, they still maintain the habit of collective labor. Every time they go hunting, they voluntarily form temporary groups of three, five, seven or eight people. This habit still has a relatively strong primitive nature. Their main purpose is not to improve and develop production, but because with more people, they can take care of each other when they go deep into the dense forest to avoid being hurt by wild animals. They also maintain a natural division of labor between men and women, with men specializing in hunting and women engaging in housework.

The distribution of hunted animals basically implements the system of equal distribution. After hunting, everyone who participates gets a share. Widows, widowers, orphans, and households with difficulties also receive some animal skins and meat to maintain their lives.

Their property basically belongs to the clan in common, but guns, horses, hunting dogs, and houses, which are basic production tools, are privately owned by each family. In fact, the utensils and storage of individuals or families can also be used by other families when needed.

With the application of guns, productivity has increased, and there has been a surplus of products; and in contact with agricultural societies, commerce has occurred, and the Oroqen primitive clan society has gradually begun to change. In exchanges with foreign ethnic groups, animal skins have become important commodities, and thus have gradually become private property. Now, after they hunt wild animals, the meat is still divided equally among everyone, but the animal skins belong to the hunter in private. Class division has occurred within the clan. The sign of wealth is the number of horses owned. It should be pointed out that although the Oroqen people have already seen a division between rich and poor, the class division is not obvious, and they do not use privately owned horses, guns, hunting dogs, or animal skins to exploit others.

Within the clan or tribe, they generally still maintain the habit of democratically deciding issues. Whenever there are major issues, the clan or tribal leaders routinely invite the elderly and relevant personnel to study and resolve them together. In marriage, they practice clan exogamy.

In addition to the Oroqen people, the Kawa people in Yunnan, the Li people in Hainan Island, and the Gaoshan people in Taiwan also retain some forms of primitive society to varying degrees. For example, the hunting of the Kawa people still maintains the principles of collective labor and equal distribution. The land in the Greater Kawa area still belongs to the entire tribe in common, and some still engage in collective production as a tribe. People of the same tribe cultivate on a piece of land together, and the distribution is calculated according to the labor provided by each family at harvest. For example, the "cooperative mu system" of the Li people and the system of joint labor and equal distribution within the "Fan she" of the Gaoshan people also have such characteristics.

(2) Types with Slave System Forms

It is well known that the Yi people have a more significant form of slave system. However, the social development of the Yi people is also unbalanced, and different regions have different social natures. The Yi areas in Yunnan and Guizhou have long entered the stage of feudal society, while the Yi society in the central area of ​​Daliang Mountain in Sichuan still has significant slavery.

The Yi people in the central area of ​​Daliang Mountain engage in early agriculture, some cultivate paddy fields, and animal husbandry is a supplementary industry; there are also handicrafts such as weaving, ironwork, and construction. These handicrafts have not completely separated from agriculture and animal husbandry. The division of labor and exchange are not developed, and the market and merchant class have not yet formed.

The Yi people in this area are divided into Black Yi and White Yi. Generally speaking, the Black Yi are slave owners, and the White Yi are slaves. The difference between them is basically a class distinction. The Black Yi account for about 15% of the total number of Yi people in Daliang Mountain. They occupy about 80% of all arable land, more than half of all cattle and sheep, and most of the production tools and houses; they also own slaves that can be bought and sold. They have the right to kill slaves. They almost completely do not engage in productive labor, mainly relying on exploiting the surplus labor of slaves, collecting land rent, and lending at usurious rates for a living. They despise labor and consider labor to be shameful.

The White Yi account for about 85% of the total number of Yi people in Daliang Mountain. According to their position in production, they can be divided into three classes: "Ga Shi Ga Luo"—that is, "Guo Zhuang children," single slaves, completely owned by the master, using the master's production tools and materials, and forced to engage in productive labor and housework. After they gain the trust of the master, they can marry and start a family, and this becomes "settled" children. "Settled" children can rent a small piece of land from the master and pay rent on time. They cannot move at will and must build another hut next to the master's residence in preparation for the master's summons at any time. These children can obtain greater personal freedom by paying a certain amount to the master, have complete ownership of their property, and also have parental rights over their children. They are called "Qu Nuo."

"Qu Nuo" still need to rely on the original master for protection, otherwise there is still a risk of being captured by others as slaves. So strictly speaking, they do not have complete personal freedom. However, both "Qu Nuo" and "Settled" can own slaves, and slaves of slaves can also own slaves, and there is even talk of "seven-level slaves."

Although the division of the White Yi class is very complex, the boundary between the Black Yi and the White Yi is very strict. For example, intermarriage between Black and White Yi is strictly prohibited, and the Black Yi can sell, transfer, plunder, slaughter, and punish the White Yi. The Black Yi never change their social status under any circumstances. The three classes of the White Yi can rise and fall to each other under certain conditions, but the White Yi can never rise to become Black Yi under any circumstances. Class contradictions within the Yi ethnic group are very obvious. Slaves often resist slave owners, damage production tools, and flee; however, due to the existence of different classes within the White Yi, differences in interests, and because of regional barriers, it is difficult to form a unified force. Because slave owners despise labor and force slaves to work, coupled with the endless succession of blood feuds and the cruel national oppression before liberation, the social productivity of the Yi ethnic group is very low. These are the main reasons for the long-term poverty and backwardness of Yi society.

In addition to the Yi people in the central area of ​​Daliang Mountain, the Jingpo people in Jiangxinpo and Hukang Valley in western Yunnan and the Sana Mountains west of the Mailikai River also have a slave system, but it is not as significant and common as the Yi slave system. Most of the slave owners are mountain officials, and most of the slaves are children who are snatched or resold. When the slaves grow up, their masters marry them, and the children they give birth to are still slaves. But slaves can redeem themselves, and slave owners and slaves work equally hard, and the difference in life is not very big. This may still be the situation in the early stages of slave society.

(3) Various Forms of Feudal Society

There are more minority nationalities belonging to this type, and they each have their own characteristics. Examples are given separately below:

(1) Uyghur in Xinjiang:

Before the land reform, the Uyghur in Xinjiang already had several different stages of development in the feudal period. The ruling class of the Uyghur in Moyu County in the south is called "Hejia" (meaning noble), and they occupy a large amount of land. They divide the land into two parts: one part is their own manor, which relies on the unpaid labor of serfs to cultivate, and the other part is the allotted land given to the serfs. Serfs need to undertake a series of unpaid labor services, which is the most important form of exploitation, representing the early form of feudalism. "Hejia" can seize the property of serfs, establish its own courts and prisons, arbitrarily torture serfs to the point of death, and can also sell and transfer them. Serfs are deprived of their personal freedom. They have different degrees of personal subordination, so they can also be divided into different classes.

The above-mentioned serfdom in the early feudal period is relatively rare in the Uyghur countryside. More common is the coexistence of unpaid labor and sharecropping. There are many ways of exploitation, and the landlord class adopts whichever way is beneficial. These exploitation methods all belong to the mid-feudal form.

Some rural areas near the urban area, such as the rural areas near Kashgar and Aksu, have a more developed commodity economy, and the exploitation method is mainly high in-kind rent and hired labor. The landlord class also engages in some commercial activities between urban and rural areas. This is a form of the late feudal period, which is not very developed in Uyghur society.

(2) Dai nationality in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan

According to existing surveys, the past feudal system of the Dai nationality was built on the ruins of the original commune. The form of the original commune is still preserved in the feudal lord economy. Their feudal lords (Tusi) stole the ownership of the village commune. Formally, there are several types of land ownership (village communal ownership, lord ownership, and farmer private ownership), but only one type of ownership occupies a dominant position, which is feudal lord ownership. The old rules of the village commune's equal distribution of land have become the equal distribution of the burden on the feudal lord—feudal exploitation. The village commune has become a labor organization for the lord to exploit the corvée labor of serfs, and the village commune has become a burden unit. The rural commune has completely deteriorated, and the original commune council only exists in form, and the content of the original democracy no longer exists. This is likely that the original rural commune was added a set of feudal ruling system by the feudal dynasty—the Tusi system, so that the original rural commune became a rural commune under the rule of the feudal lord. Their social form still preserves the original commune to a certain extent, but in essence it is already a feudal society.

(3) Tibetan in Tibet

The characteristic of Tibetan feudal society in Tibet is the system of integration of politics and religion. Under this system, politics and religion are closely combined to maintain and consolidate its feudal social and economic foundation. Most of the land in Tibet belongs to the lama monasteries, nobles, and local governments. Monasteries own a large amount of land, nobles have their own manors, and officials working in local governments have certain feudal fiefdoms. Farmers and herdsmen are the exploited class, and they have to bear a series of obligations to monasteries, nobles, and local governments, including rent and unpaid labor.

In addition to the above three types of feudal forms, there are many minority areas that are similar to the feudal nature of the past Han areas. They are also subject to the oppression and exploitation of feudal officials and landlords. For example, the minority areas in Guizhou and east of it, which are closer to the Han people or mixed with the Han people, although there was feudal rule of Tusi in history, most of them had already changed from Tusi rule to the rule of officials appointed by the central government during the Qing Dynasty and established the rule of officials. Their social nature is similar to that of nearby Han rural areas, but the people of minority nationalities suffer an extra layer of oppression and exploitation, because in addition to the exploitation of landlords, they also add the oppression and exploitation of the feudal dynasty of Han chauvinism. ☆

From the above brief introduction, we can see the following characteristics of the minority nationalities in our country in terms of the nature of society:

1. The social development of minority nationalities in our country is unbalanced. In addition to those nationalities whose social nature is roughly the same as that of the Han nationality, many were still in the pre-capitalist period or the stage of social development in the budding stage of capitalism before the democratic reform and socialist transformation. Among them, some still retain considerable remnants of primitive communes, and many are basically still slave societies and early feudal societies.

2. The social nature of various minority nationalities is complex. It is difficult for us to find a typical example of a certain stage of social development. Often there are multiple socio-economic components in a society. For example, in the Yi nationality in the central area of ​​Daliang Mountain, which is generally considered to be a slave society, the identity of the Black Yi is not simply slave owners, they may also have the nature of feudal lords. Because in addition to owning slaves, they also rent out land and occupy the surplus labor of land tenants in the form of corvée labor and in-kind rent. The class status of the Anjia children among the White Yi is also worth in-depth analysis, because some people say that they have begun to transition from slave status to serfs. The nature of "Qu Nuo" is even more complex, because they can own land and slaves, engage in exploitation, but at the same time have not gotten rid of their slave status. The social nature of various minority nationalities is certainly complex, but among the various economic components, some are old remnants, some are new buds, and some are the dominant components at the time, and these can and should be distinguished.

3. Significant regional differences can also occur within the same minority nationality. The degree of this difference can sometimes be very large, even belonging to different stages of social development. In the central area of ​​Daliang Mountain, the slave economic component occupies the main position in the Yi ethnic group, but in the border areas, the feudal economic component is already very significant; the Yi ethnic group in Guizhou and Yunnan has developed feudalism for a considerable period of time, and some have even exceeded the early feudal form. The Uyghur in Xinjiang has three forms: early, middle, and late feudal in different regions. The central area of ​​the Li nationality still implements a cooperative mu system with a primitive communal economy, but the outer areas near the Han nationality are already a feudal individual small-peasant economy.

4. Although the social nature of the ethnic groups at the same stage of social development basically has common characteristics, they still have their own characteristics in form. Taking feudal society as an example, the examples mentioned above can show that the characteristics of each ethnic group are very significant. The methods of exploitation adopted by the "Hejia" manor in Xinjiang, the integration of politics and religion in Tibet, and the Tusi in the Dai nationality are not the same. Comparative research on various forms can greatly enrich our knowledge of social morphology.

5. Minority nationalities do not always progress step by step in the historical process of social development, that is, they do not necessarily go through the stages of primitive to slavery to feudalism. Leaping over stages has also occurred in history. For example, Dai society, based on existing materials, directly transitioned from primitive society to feudal society, skipping the stage of slave society in the middle. Some people believe that similar situations may have occurred in the Mongolian, Uyghur, and Manchu nationalities. The historical conditions for this situation are complex. But this situation also suggests that we should pay special attention to the relationship between various minority nationalities and the Han nationality in history, because this situation is often the result of the contact between relatively backward communities and the more advanced Han nationality.

6. In areas where many ethnic groups live together, there is also a situation where different ethnic components have entered the same class structure, but each still retains the characteristics of different social natures. For example, in the past, some Miao people in western Guizhou were ruled and exploited by the Yi ethnic group. At that time, the Yi ethnic group was already a slave society or an early feudal society, but those ruled Miao people still retained the remnants of primitive communes to a certain extent. In the process of the entry of Han feudal forces into minority areas to rule and exploit minority nationalities, this situation may also have occurred.

7. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, various minority nationalities, regardless of their original social nature, have, with the help of advanced nationalities, leaped over several stages of social development and transitioned to socialist society, thus causing a series of important changes. The changes they have undergone also have their own characteristics. For example, the Oroqen people mentioned above are undergoing socialist transformation on the basis of their primitive society and developing hunting cooperatives. The contradictions they encounter are different from those encountered in the transformation of slave societies or feudal societies. When they implement the principle of distribution according to work, it conflicts with the original principle of equal distribution. Therefore, special methods must be adopted in the transformation measures. These are also issues that we should pay attention to when studying the nature of society.

The above characteristics should be paid attention to when analyzing the social nature of minority nationalities.

The research on the nature of society of minority nationalities did not start now. In the practice of nationality work, we cannot but pay attention to the characteristics of the development of various nationalities. The Communist Party of China has already started research in this area in the old liberated areas, and it has been further developed after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the past, ethnologists also collected some information on this issue. However, the information occupied in the past is not comprehensive and in-depth enough, and most of the research work is not systematic enough. Although we have some preliminary understanding of the nature of society of various minority nationalities, it is still very insufficient. Therefore, we should attach importance to this research and regard it as the central work of ethnological research for a period of time to come.

In carrying out this research work, we should pay attention to avoiding the following possible biases:

1. In the past, when ethnologists conducted social surveys among minority nationalities, they often lacked clear requirements. The investigators recorded some sporadic anecdotes based solely on personal interests or without a purpose, and neglected to collect key materials related to the nature of society. Even if they paid attention to these issues, they rarely conducted in-depth investigations and repeated checks, so that they often felt that the materials were insufficient during further analysis. This is the result of the lack of theoretical guidance in the investigation work.

2. Some ethnologists are eager to draw conclusions about the social nature of certain nationalities before they have fully occupied the factual materials. They often use quotations from classic works to replace in-depth observation and are satisfied with selecting some sporadic examples to prove the correctness of general laws. This dogmatism does not do our research work any good. We must seek truth from facts and combine theory with practice. Only through gradually in-depth systematic investigation and research can we gain a correct understanding of the social nature of various minority nationalities.

3. Due to the complexity of the social nature of various minority nationalities, they often have economic components of different natures, and they have very significant regional differences, etc. If the researchers subjectively have prejudices, they are easily deceived by one-sided or local facts and make incorrect conclusions. Therefore, when carrying out this research work, we should focus on comprehensively and deeply collecting relevant materials, and use repeated investigation methods to check special conclusions drawn from existing materials. Hasty and impatient biases must be overcome.

    关于少数民族社会性质的研究
    费孝通　林耀华
    关于各少数民族的社会性质的研究是我国民族学当前的重要任务，也是今后一段时期中的中心工作。目前各少数民族正在或即将进行社会主义改造，而在社会主义改造的问题上，如中华人民共和国宪法序言中所规定的，将充分注意各民族发展的特点。各民族社会性质的研究的目的就在明确他们发展上的特点，因此，这项研究是密切和当前民族工作相结合的。
    这项研究也将丰富我们对于社会发展史的知识，充实历史唯物主义的内容。而且现在我们所有社会发展史的教材大多依靠翻译，如原始社会引用摩尔根的调查，奴隶社会举希腊、罗马为例等。这些材料固然极为重要，但是对于我国的一般读者是比较生疏的，因此限制了这门科学知识的传播。事实上我国在这方面却有着丰富的材料。我国少数民族在进行民主改革和社会主义改造以前，许多还没有进入资本主义的阶段，所以还在不同程度上保有前资本主义时期各种社会形态的面貌或残余。对于各少数民族社会性质的调查就将为我们记录和搜集有关各种社会形态的材料，这些也正是社会发展史的生动教材。
    必须指出，由于各少数民族正在或即将迅速地进行社会主义改造，我们如果不及时把他们在改造之前的面貌记录下来，很快就会丧失直接观察的机会了。因此，这项研究也应该看成是一项急迫的任务。
    现在我们可以根据已经有的，但不够系统和深入的材料，举例说一下我国少数民族在进行民主改革和社会主义改造以前存在着那些不同的社会形态：
    （一）带有原始社会形态的类型
    东北兴安岭森林中的鄂伦春人是这种形态的一个例子。他们主要依靠狩猎为生，生产工具很简单。很早以前，他们用自制的弓箭进行狩猎。约在1920年以后，大量使用了各种枪支。在季节性围猎的间隙，他们也进行捕鱼。生活游移不定。
    他们的生产关系基本上是土地氏族公有，共同劳动，平均分配。他们的鱼场和猎场只许自己氏族的人使用。他们人人参加劳动。迄今仍保持着集体劳动的习惯，每次出猎都是三、五人或七、八人自愿组成临时小组。这种习惯还带着比较浓厚的原始性质。他们最主要的目的，并不是为了提高与发展生产，而是由于人多了，深入密林后可以互相照顾，免被野兽伤害。他们男女之间也保持着自然的分工，男子专司狩猎，妇女从事家务劳动。
    猎获物的分配基本上实行平均分配的制度。打猎完毕，参加的人每人都分得一份。那些鳏寡孤独和困难户，也都分得一些兽皮和肉类以维持生活。
    他们的财产基本上都属于氏族公有，但是作为基本生产工具的枪支、马匹、猎犬以及房屋已归各家族私有；实际上，个人或家族的用具和储藏的东西，遇有需要亦可为其他家族使用。
    随着枪支的应用，生产力提高了，生产品有了剩余；又与农业社会相接触，发生了商业，鄂伦春的原始氏族社会开始逐渐发生变化。在和外族进行交换中，兽皮成了重要的商品，于是也逐渐成了私有财产。现在他们猎得野兽以后，兽肉还是大家平均分食，但是兽皮却属于猎获者所私有。氏族内部发生了贫富之分。贫富的标志是占有马匹的多寡。应该指出，尽管鄂伦春人已经出现了贫富之分，但是阶级分化还不明显，他们并不利用私有的马匹、枪支、猎犬或兽皮来剥削别人。
    在氏族或部落内部，他们一般都还保持着民主决定问题的习惯。每有重大问题，照例都由氏族或部落首领邀请老年人和有关人员共同研究解决。在婚姻上，他们实行氏族外婚制。
    除了鄂伦春人以外，云南的卡瓦人，海南岛的黎人，和台湾的高山人也多少保留着一些原始社会的形态。如卡瓦人的狩猎还保持集体劳动，平均分配的原则。大卡瓦地区土地还属于全部落公有，有的还以部落为单位集体生产，同一部落的人共同在一块土地上耕种，到收获时按各家所出劳动力计算分配。又如黎人的“合亩制”和高山人的“蕃社”组成内部的共同劳动、平均分配的制度，也都具有这样的性质。
    （二）带有奴隶制度的形态
    大家熟知的是彝族具有较显著的奴隶制度的形态。但是，彝族的社会发展也是不平衡的，不同地区就具有不同的社会性质。云南、贵州的彝族地区早已进入封建社会的阶段，而四川大凉山中心地区的彝族社会迄今仍带有显著的奴隶制。
    大凉山中心地区的彝人经营初期农业，部分耕种水田，有以畜牧为副业；也有纺织、铁工、建筑等手工业。这些手工业还没有完全从农牧业中分离出来。分工与交换不发达，市场与商人阶级还没有形成。
    这个地区的彝人有黑彝和白彝之别，大体说来，黑彝是奴隶主，白彝是奴隶，他们的区别基本上是阶级的区分。黑彝约占大凉山彝人总数的15％，他们占有全部可耕地的80％左右，全部牛羊牧畜半数以上，以及大部分生产工具和房屋；同时占有可以买卖的奴隶。他们有权杀戮奴隶。他们几乎完全不从事生产劳动，主要靠剥削奴隶的剩余劳动，收地租，放高利贷为生。他们轻视劳动，认为劳动是可耻的。
    白彝约占大凉山彝人总数的85％。依据他们在生产中所处的地位，可以分为三个阶层：“噶示噶洛”——即“锅庄娃子”，单身的奴隶，完全属于主人所有，使用主人的生产工具和资料，被迫进行生产劳动和家务劳动。他们得到主人的信任以后，可以结婚成家，这就成了“安家”娃子。“安家”娃子从主人处可以租到一小块土地，按期交纳地租。他们不能随意迁移，必须在主人住处的一旁另筑小屋居住，以备主人的随时召唤。这些娃子给主人一定身价可以获得较大的人身自由，对自己的财产具有完全的所有权，对其子女也具有亲权。他们称作“曲诺”。
    “曲诺”仍须依附原来的主人以求得保护，否则仍有被别人掳为奴隶的危险。所以严格说来，他们并没有完全的人身自由。但是“曲诺”和“安家”却又都可以占有奴隶，奴隶的奴隶又可以占有奴隶，甚至有“七道娃子”之说。
    尽管白彝阶层的分化很复杂，但是，黑彝和白彝的界限却是十分严格的。如严禁黑白彝通婚，黑彝可以出卖、转让、掠夺、屠杀、刑罚白彝。黑彝在任何情况下都不改变他们的社会地位。白彝中的三个阶层在一定条件下可以互相升降，但白彝在任何情况下都不能上升为黑彝。彝族内部的阶级矛盾是很明显的。奴隶们对奴隶主的反抗，毁坏生产工具，逃亡的事情是经常发生的；但是由于白彝内部存在不同的阶层，利益有差别，而且因为地域阻隔，很难形成统一的力量。由于奴隶主轻视劳动，并强迫奴隶劳动，加以血族复仇的事连绵不绝，和解放以前残酷的民族压迫，彝族的社会生产力是很低的。这些是彝族社会长期贫困、落后的主要原因。
    除了大凉山中心地区的彝人以外，云南西部江心坡及胡康河谷、迈里开江以西的萨纳山地的景颇人也有蓄奴制，但不像彝族奴隶制那样显著和普遍。蓄奴者多系山官，奴隶多系抢来或转卖的幼童。奴隶长大了，他们的主人为他们婚嫁，他们所生的子女仍是奴隶。但奴隶可以赎身，奴隶主与奴隶同样劳动，生活差异也不很大。这可能还是在奴隶社会初期的情形。
    （三）封建社会的各种形态
    属于这类型的少数民族，为数较多，而且还各有各的特点，现分别举例如下：
    （1）新疆维吾尔族：
    新疆的维吾尔族在土地改革以前就具备了封建时期的若干不同发展阶段。南部的墨玉县维族的统治阶级被称为“和加”（贵族之意），他们占有大量土地。他们把土地分为两部分：一部分是自有庄园，依靠农奴的无偿劳役来耕作，另一部分是给予农奴的份地。农奴需要承担一系列的无偿劳役，这是最主要的剥削方式，代表着封建初期的形态。“和加”可以夺取农奴财产，自立法庭和监狱，可以对农奴任意刑讯以至拷打至死，也可把他们变卖转让。农奴被剥夺了人身的自由。他们在人身的隶属性上具有程度上的不同，所以也可分出不同的阶层。
    以上的那种封建初期的农奴制在维族的农村中还是比较少的，比较多的是无偿劳役和对分制同时并存的剥削方式。这种剥削方式又有多种多样，地主阶级看那样有利，就采取那种方式。这些剥削方式都是属于封建中期的形态。
    城区附近的一些农村，如喀什、阿克苏附近的农村，由于这些地区商品经济比较发达，剥削方式主要是高额的实物地租和雇佣劳动。地主阶级也经营一些城乡间的商业。这是封建后期的一种形态，在维族社会中还不很发达。
    （2）云南西双版纳的傣族
    据现有的调查，傣族过去的封建制度是在原始公社的废墟上建立起来的。在封建领主经济中，依旧保存了原始公社的形式。他们的封建领主（土司）窃取了村社所有权。形式上存在着几种土地所有制（村公有、领主所有、农民私有），但占统治地位的只是一种所有制，就是封建领主所有制。村社平分土地的陈规，已变成平均分配对封建领主的负担——封建剥削，村社变成领主剥削农奴劳役的劳动编组，村社变成了负担单位。农村公社已完全变质，原有的公社议事会也仅存形式，原始民主的内容已不存在了。这很可能是原始农村公社在发展过程中，被封建王朝加上了一套封建统治的制度——土司制度，从而使原始农村公社变成了封建领主统治下的农村公社了。他们的社会形式在一定程度上还保存了原始的公社，但是实质上已是封建社会了。
    （3）西藏地方的藏族
    西藏藏族封建社会的特点就是政教合一制度。在这种制度下政治和宗教密切结合起来，维护巩固它的封建的社会经济基础。西藏全境的土地大部分都属于喇嘛寺院、贵族和地方政府。寺院拥有大量的土地，贵族有自己的庄园，参加地方政府工作的官员都有一定的封建采邑。农民与牧民是被剥削的阶级，他们要为寺院、贵族和地方政府承担一系列的义务，包括租税和无偿劳役。
    除了上述的三种类型的封建形态以外，还有许多少数民族地区是同过去汉族地区封建性质相差不多，他们也是受着封建官吏和地主们的压迫和剥削，如贵州及其以东的比较接近汉人或与汉人杂居的少数民族地区在历史上虽然也有过土司的封建统治，但大多在清代即已改土归流，建立了流官的统治。他们的社会性质与附近汉族农村相差不多，不过少数民族的人民所受到的压迫剥削更加多一层，因为除了地主的剥削外，还加上大民族主义封建王朝的压迫剥削。☆
    从上面简略介绍中，我们可以看到我国少数民族在社会性质的问题上存在着下面这些特点：
    1．我国少数民族社会发展是不平衡的。除了那些大体和汉族的社会性质相同的民族外，许多在进行民主改革和社会主义改造以前还处于前资本主义时期或资本主义萌芽时期的社会发展阶段。其中有一些还保持相当浓厚的原始公社的残余，有不少基本上还是奴隶社会和初期封建社会。
    2．各少数民族的社会性质是复杂的。我们很难找到某一个社会发展阶段的典型例子。常常在一个社会中存在着多种社会经济成份，比如以一般认为是奴隶社会的大凉山中心区的彝族来说，黑彝的身分并不是单纯的奴隶主，他们同时可能具有封建主的性质。因为他们在蓄奴以外，又出租土地，以赋役和实物地租的形式占有土地承租者的剩余劳动。白彝中的安家娃子的阶级地位也是值得深入分析的，因为有人说他们已经开始从奴隶身分向农奴过渡。“曲诺”的性质更是复杂，因为他们可以占有土地和蓄奴，进行剥削，但同时并没有摆脱奴隶的身分。各少数民族的社会性质固然是复杂的，但在多种经济成分中，有些是旧的残余，有些是新的萌芽，和有些是当时占主要地位的成分，这些都是可以也应当区别出来的。
    3．同一少数民族中还可以发生显著的地域上的差异。这种差异程度有时可以很大，甚至属于不同的社会发展阶段。彝族在大凉山中心地区，奴隶经济成分占着主要的地位，但是在边区封建经济成分已经很显著；贵州、云南的彝族已有相当长的时期发展了封建主义，有些甚至已超过了初期封建的形态。新疆维吾尔族在不同地区就有封建初期、中期、晚期三种形态。黎族的中心地区还实行着具有原始共耕经济的合亩制，但是外围靠近汉族的地区已经是封建性的个体小农经济了。
    4．在相同的社会发展阶段上的各族，他们的社会性质虽则基本上具有共同特点，但是在形式上还是各有各的特点。以封建社会来说，上面所举的例子就可以看到各民族所有的特点是很显著的。新疆维吾尔“和加”的庄园、西藏政教合一制、傣族的土司等所采取的剥削方式都不是一样的。各种形式的比较研究，可以大大丰富我们对于社会形态学说的知识。
    5．少数民族在社会发展的历史过程中并不都是循序渐进的，就是说，不一定都是经过原始到奴隶、到封建这些阶段的。跨越阶段的飞跃过渡的情形在历史上也发生过，比如傣族社会，以现有材料来看，就是直接从原始社会过渡得封建社会，中间越过了奴隶社会这个阶段。有人认为蒙古族、维族和满族也可能曾发生过类似情况。发生这种情况的历史条件是复杂的。但这种情况也提示了我们应当特别注意各少数民族在历史上和汉族的关系，因为这种情况常常是比较落后的共同体和比较先进的汉族相接触的结果。
    6．在多民族杂居的地区还发生一种情况，就是不同民族成分虽则已经进入了同一的阶级结构中，但是各自还保存了不同社会性质的特点。比如贵州西部过去有些苗人受着彝族的统治和剥削，彝族当时已经是奴隶社会或初期封建社会，但是那些被统治的苗人却在一定程度上还保留原始公社的残余。在汉族封建势力进入少数民族地区，对少数民族进行统治和剥削的过程中，也可能发生过这种情况。
    7．中华人民共和国成立以来，各少数民族，不论他们原来的社会是什么性质，在先进民族的帮助下，跨越了若干社会发展的阶段，向社会主义社会过渡，因此引起了一系列的重要变化。他们所经过的变化也是各有各的特点。比如上面所述的鄂伦春人正在从他们原始社会的基础进行社会主义改造，发展狩猎合作社。他们遇到的矛盾和奴隶社会或封建社会在改造中所遇到的矛盾是不同的。他们在实行按劳分配的原则时就和原有平均分配的原则相抵触，因此，在改造的措施上不能不采取特有的方式。这些也是我们研究社会性质时所应当注意的问题。
    在对少数民族进行社会性质的分析时，应当注意上述的这些特点。
    关于少数民族社会性质的研究并不是现在才开始的。在民族工作的实践中不能不经常注意各民族发展上的特点。中国共产党在老解放区已经开始了这方面的研究，中华人民共和国成立后，更有了发展。过去民族学者也搜集过一些有关这个问题的资料。但是过去占有的资料还不够全面和深入，研究工作也大多不够系统，我们对各少数民族社会性质虽则有一些初步的认识，但是还很不充分。因此，我们应当重视这项研究，作为今后一段时期的民族学研究的中心工作。
    在进行这项研究工作时，我们应当注意避免以下几种可能发生的偏向：
    1、过去民族学者在少数民族中进行社会调查时，往往缺乏明确的要求，调查者单凭个人兴趣或是没有目的地纪录一些零星见闻，忽略搜集有关社会性质的关键性的材料。即使注意到了这些问题，也很少深入调查和反复核对，以致在进一步分析时常常感到材料不够了。这是调查工作缺乏理论指导的结果。
    2、也有些民族学者在还没有充分占有事实材料以前，急于想对某些民族的社会性质作出结论。他们往往用一些经典著作上的引语来代替深入的观察，满足于挑选一些零星的例子来证明一般规律的正确性。这种教条主义对于我们的研究工作并无一点好处。我们必须实事求是，理论与实际相结合，通过逐步深入的系统调查研究，才能对各少数民族社会性质得到正确的认识。
    3、由于各少数民族社会性质的复杂性，他们常常具有不同性质的经济成分，他们又有很显著的地域上的差异等等，研究工作者如果主观上具有成见，很容易被片面的或局部的事实所迷惑，而作出不正确的结论。因此在进行这项研究工作时应当着重全面深入搜集有关材料，以反复调查的方法来核校从已有材料中得出特别的结论，草率和急躁的偏向是必须克服的。
