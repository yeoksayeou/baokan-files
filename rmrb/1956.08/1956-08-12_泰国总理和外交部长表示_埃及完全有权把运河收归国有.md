Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: According to Western news agency reports, Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram said on August 10th that his government believes Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal is within its sovereign rights.

Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram said at a press conference that if direct negotiations between the concerned countries fail, the Suez Canal issue should be submitted to the United Nations.

Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon said on the same day that Thailand recognizes that, according to international law, Egypt has the full right to nationalize the canal. Wan Waithayakon said that if negotiations cannot resolve this matter, the United Nations may have to discuss the issue.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, Bangkok dispatch: Many Thai newspapers oppose the demand for "international control" of the Suez Canal proposed by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in their joint communiqué suggesting the convening of a twenty-four-nation conference.

The "Siam Rath" editorial on August 5th stated: "The Suez Canal is an important waterway for all countries, this is a fact, but the Suez Canal is located within the scope of Egyptian territorial sovereignty. Therefore, it should be considered that to ask Egypt to agree to international control of this canal would cause Egypt to lose its sovereignty and dignity."

The "Pictorial News" editorial on August 6th stated that the three countries' suggestion of international control of the Suez Canal can be said to be interference in the internal affairs of another country. The "Universal Daily News" editorial on August 4th also expressed the same opinion. The editorial said: "If this can be done to the Suez Canal, then it will certainly be possible to do this to the Panama Canal." The editorial then asked: "If the United States does not allow it, then the United States should also think about: Is it appropriate to oppress other countries to abandon their sovereignty and force them to agree to international control of Egypt's Suez Canal?"

    泰国总理和外交部长表示
    埃及完全有权把运河收归国有
    据新华社11日讯　据西方通讯社报道，泰国总理銮披汶八月十日说，他的政府认为埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有是它主权范围以内的事。
    銮披汶元帅在记者招待会上说，如果有关各国的直接谈判失败，苏彝士运河问题应当提交联合国。
    泰国外交部长那拉底在同一天说，泰国承认，按照国际法，埃及完全有权把这条运河收归国有。那拉底说，如果谈判不能解决这件事情，联合国可能必须讨论这个问题。
    新华社11日讯　曼谷消息：泰国许多家报纸反对英法美三国在建议召开二十四国会议的联合公报中所提出的对苏彝士运河实行“国际管制”的要求。
    “暹罗群众报”八月五日的社论说：“苏彝士运河对各国是一条重要的航路，这是事实，但是，苏彝士运河是处在埃及领土主权范围以内的。因此，应当认为，要埃及同意国际管制这条运河，这将使埃及丧失主权和尊严。”
    “图画新闻”八月六日的社论说，三国提出的国际管制苏彝士运河的建议，可以说是对另外一国的内政的干涉。“永恒报”八月四日的社论也表示了相同的意见。社论说：“如果对苏彝士运河可以这样做，那么接着也一定可以对巴拿马运河这样做。”社论接着问道：“如果美国不允许，那么美国也应当想一想：去压迫别国放弃它自己主权，并且迫使它同意国际管制埃及的苏彝士运河，难道是适宜的吗？”
