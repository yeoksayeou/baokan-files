    Southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province recently experienced widespread and thorough rainfall. This rain will play a significant role in ensuring the growth of autumn crops. Since July, when cotton was flowering and bolling, and autumn crops such as rice and corn were jointing and heading, drought conditions had occurred in southern Shaanxi, the Guanzhong area, and the northern part of the Yan'an Special District. The water in some large canals could no longer pass over the dams, and some small canals had dried up. In areas with severe drought, the leaves of corn and millet curled up every noon, and cotton also experienced flower and bud drop. Party and government leaders and all farmers have vigorously engaged in drought prevention and resistance. This welcome rain has now relieved the threat of drought to the growth of autumn crops. Currently, farmers are actively strengthening field management of autumn crops. In areas with excessive rainfall, attention is being paid to preventing waterlogging.
