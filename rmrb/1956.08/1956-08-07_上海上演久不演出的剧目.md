Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Recently, Shanghai has successively staged many adapted and long-dormant plays.

    The Peking Opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother," performed by the Xinmin Peking Opera Troupe, is often sold out. This performance is entirely based on the old play, without any modifications, in order to listen to the audience's opinions and sort it out. The troupe is also preparing to try out nearly ten old plays such as "Yanmen Pass" and "Shi Qian Steals the Chicken."
    The Yue Opera "Zhan Yuanmen’s Daughter," performed not long ago, is also a traditional old play. Yue Opera actress Zhang Yunxia, who plays the daughter, can express the strong rebellious character of the character in the play. During the performance, she constantly won applause. Shanghai cultural departments are preparing to organize theater circles to watch this play in order to widely solicit opinions and further sort out and revise the script.
    Recently staged in Shanghai, long-dormant or adapted plays also include Yue Opera's "Searching the Academy" and Shanghai Opera's "Malan Flower," etc.

    上海上演久不演出的剧目
    新华社上海4日电　最近上海陆续上演了许多改编和久未上演的剧目。
    新民京剧团演出的京剧“四郎探母”经常客满。这次演出完全根据老戏，未作任何修改，以便听取观众意见，加以整理。这个剧团还准备试演“雁门关”、“时迁偷鸡”等近十出老戏。
    不久前演出的越剧“辕门斩女”，也是一出传统老戏。扮演女儿的越剧演员张云霞能表达出剧中人的坚强反抗的性格。演出时，不断博得掌声。上海文化部门准备组织剧曲界人士观摩这出戏，以便广泛听取意见，进一步整理、修改剧本。
    上海最近上演的久不上演或改编的剧目还有越剧“搜书院”和沪剧“马兰花”等。
