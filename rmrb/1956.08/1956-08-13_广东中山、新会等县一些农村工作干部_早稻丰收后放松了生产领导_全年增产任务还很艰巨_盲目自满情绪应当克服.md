Some Rural Work Cadres in Zhongshan and Xinhui Counties, Guangdong Province, Relax Leadership in Production After Early Rice Harvest
The Annual Production Increase Task is Still Arduous; Blind Complacency Should Be Overcome

    (Our report) In most agricultural production cooperatives in Guangdong Province, the early rice harvest this year has seen varying degrees of increased production. During the summer harvest distribution, most cooperatives implemented reasonable distribution policies, ensuring that more than 90% of their members increased their income. A portion of the members who had wavered and considered withdrawing from the cooperatives have largely settled down. The dissatisfaction of some farmers with the grain shortage has also been further alleviated. Advanced agricultural production techniques and experiences have been widely welcomed and accepted by the masses. The confidence of the masses in overcoming natural disasters has also been strengthened. However, at present, some cadres have overestimated the achievements of the early rice production increase, ignored the difficult aspects of late rice production, and developed a sense of blind complacency. In Zhuxi Township, Zhongshan County, when only a portion of the early rice had been harvested, most of the late-maturing varieties were still in the grouting stage, and the third generation of rice stem borers was already prevalent, and 160 mu of late rice autumn fields were seriously infested by insects, the cadres of the district, township, and cooperative turned a blind eye to these situations, content with the estimated output figures, and even said: "Where can white-backed planthoppers come from on seedlings that are only a little over an inch tall!" The cooperative members were idle and waiting for work, requesting to collect base fertilizer for the late rice paddies, but the cadres were busy holding consecutive "victory celebration meetings." The senior cooperative of Zhongnan Township, Enping County, increased early rice production by 25%. Some cooperative cadres said: "Early rice production has increased, and the members are enthusiastic. Summer planting work can be done well with just a little effort." However, on July 14, the township party branch conducted an in-depth inspection and found that 117 mu of nursery fields in the cooperative had not been fertilized, 20% of the seedlings were scorched yellow, and 2,000 mu of fields had not been plowed due to drought. At that time, the drought was very serious, but 31 waterwheels in the cooperative were broken and not repaired, indicating that they were completely unprepared ideologically and materially for late rice production. The Xinhui County Farmers' Newspaper also revealed that many cadres in the county only praised the achievements of early rice production increases, underestimated the difficult aspects of late rice production, so they did not actively kill the serious insect pests in the seedlings, did not actively find ways to solve the lack of fertilizer, and did not conscientiously implement technical reforms and production increase measures. Some cadres in the Pingzhou District of Nanhai County, seeing the good harvest of early rice this year, believed that "the task was completed" and no longer organized and mobilized the masses to do a good job in late rice production. In some townships and cooperatives in Suixi County, no one was even responsible for the storage of early rice after the harvest. The grain of the Taoxi Cooperative was washed away by water, and no one cared about it. The general reflection from all over the province is that the enthusiasm of cadres in the summer harvest and planting is far less than that in spring plowing. These situations deserve close attention from the leaders in various places, and they should be reversed as soon as possible. Although early rice production has increased, it is still not easy to complete the annual production increase task. Zhongshan County's early rice production increased by 57% compared to last year, and the production increase achievement is relatively outstanding in the province; however, the county has only completed 44% of its annual production plan. If leadership is relaxed as it is now, there is a danger of failing to complete the annual production plan. (Yun Feng)

### 广东中山、新会等县一些农村工作干部  早稻丰收后放松了生产领导  全年增产任务还很艰巨　盲目自满情绪应当克服

    广东中山、新会等县一些农村工作干部
    早稻丰收后放松了生产领导
    全年增产任务还很艰巨　盲目自满情绪应当克服
    本报讯　广东省各地大部分农业生产合作社，今年早稻都获得了不同程度的增产；夏收分配中，大部分社又贯彻执行了合理的分配政策，保证了90％以上的社员增加收入。一部分曾经动摇想退社的社员，大部安定下来了。过去部分农民对粮食紧张的不满情绪，也进一步消除了。先进的农业生产技术经验，已经较为普遍受到群众的欢迎和接受。群众对战胜自然灾害的信心也加强了。但是，目前有一部分干部，过高地估计了早造增产的成绩，忽视了晚造生产中的困难一面，滋长了盲目自满的情绪。在中山县竹溪乡，当早稻还只收割完一部分，大部分迟熟种正在灌浆，第三代螟虫又已经盛发，晚造秋田160亩受了严重虫害的时候，区、乡、社的干部对这些情况却熟视无睹，满足于估产的数字，还说：“一寸多高的秧苗，哪来的白翼仔！”社员闲着等活干，要求收集晚造稻田的基肥，而干部却忙着连续召开“庆功会”。恩平县中南乡高级社早造增产25％，有些社干部说：“早造增产了，社员劲头高，夏种工作只要转一下，就可以搞好了。”但七月十四日这个乡党支部深入检查，发现社里117亩秧田没有施肥，秧苗焦黄了20％，有二千亩田因受旱还没有犁。当时旱情很严重，但社里31条水车残坏了也没有修理，看来完全没有做好晚造生产的思想和物质准备。新会县农民报也揭露出：这个县不少干部对早造增产成绩只是连声叫好，低估了晚造生产的困难方面，因此，秧苗虫害严重不积极捕杀，缺乏肥料不积极想法解决，技术改革和增产措施，也没有认真贯彻执行。南海县平洲区一部分干部，看到今年早造丰收，就认为“大功告成，”不再去组织和发动群众做好晚造生产。遂溪县有一些乡、社，甚至早稻收割后也无人负责保管，桃溪社的谷被水冲走了也无人过问。全省各地普遍的反映是：夏收夏种中干部的劲头远远比不上春耕好。这些情况值得各地领导方面严密注意，及早扭转。早造虽然增产了，要完成全年的增产任务还是很不容易的。中山县早造比去年增产57％，增产成绩在全省是比较突出的；可是，这个县全年生产计划还只完成了44％。像目前这样放松领导，就有完不成全年生产计划的危险。（云风）
