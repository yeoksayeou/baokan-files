    Do not "club people from behind" or engage in personal attacks
    Readers Sun Ji and Wang Zixiu wrote to us criticizing the article "The Face is also Revolutionary" on page 8 of this newspaper on August 2.
    The letter pointed out that how to understand Tao Yuanming's two lines of poetry, "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, I leisurely see the Southern Mountains," is open to discussion. However, the author of this article did not clearly state his own views, but used a frivolous tone to mock "a self-proclaimed scholar" who "always wants to express unique opinions to show his erudition." This is not an attitude of discussing issues, but a trick similar to "clubbing people from behind." At the same time, the author's words such as "tomato soup is also revolutionary" and "the face is also revolutionary" are actually a kind of abuse.
    The letter believes that this article is "deliberately ruining people" and is "engaging in personal attacks," and it is inappropriate for the editor to publish this article.
    Editor's note: We believe that the opinions of readers Sun Ji and Wang Zixiu are correct.

### 不要“打闷棍”和进行人身攻击

    不要“打闷棍”和进行人身攻击
    读者孙机、王子修来信，对本报八月二日第八版上“脸也是革命的”一文提出了批评。
    来信中指出：对陶渊明的两句诗：“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”，应该作何理解，是可以研究的。但是，这篇文章的作者不讲清楚自己的见解，只是用轻佻的语气，嘲笑“一位自封的学者”“总想发表独特的见解，以显示自己的渊博”。这不是一种讨论问题的态度，而是一种类似“打闷棍”的勾当。同时，作者所说的“蕃茄汤也是革命的”，“脸也是革命的”等话，实际上是一种谩骂。
    来信认为：这篇文章是“故意糟蹋人”，是“进行人身攻击”，编者把这篇文章发表出来是不妥当的。
    编者按：读者孙机、王子修的意见，我们认为是正确的。
