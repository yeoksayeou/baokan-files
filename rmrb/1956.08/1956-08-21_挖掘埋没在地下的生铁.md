Xinhua News Agency report: The Fujian Provincial Department of Industry, the Handicraft Industry Bureau, and other units recently went to eleven coastal counties, including Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Fuqing, and Putian, to investigate and excavate large quantities of pig iron buried underground together with local farmers. It is estimated that about 400 tons can be excavated by the end of this year.

Lianjiang, Luoyuan, and other coastal counties in Fujian Province were historically important coastal defense strongholds. A large number of earth cannons made of cast pig iron were originally erected here, most of which have been abandoned and buried underground. According to reports from local farmers, the estimated amount is over 1,000 tons.

The Fuzhou No. 1 Machine Factory, No. 2 Machine Factory, and others have already collected more than 100 tons of this pig iron in these areas during June and July for manufacturing diesel engines.

    挖掘埋没在地下的生铁
    据新华社讯　福建省工业厅、手工业管理局等单位，最近分别到连江、罗源、福清、莆田等十一个沿海县份，同当地农民一起调查和挖掘埋在地下的大量生铁，预计到今年年底约可挖掘出四百吨。
    福建省沿海连江、罗源等县，是中国历史上的海防要塞，原来在这里架设有大量生铁铸造的土炮，大都已经被废弃和埋没在地下，据各地农民反映，约计在一千吨以上。
    福州第一机器厂、第二机器厂等在六、七月间已经在这些地区搜集了这种生铁一百多吨，用来制造柴油机。
