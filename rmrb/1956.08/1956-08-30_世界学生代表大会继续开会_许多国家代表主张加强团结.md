Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 29th - The Fourth World Student Congress continued its sessions on the afternoon and evening of the 27th.

　　The first to speak at the afternoon session was Majumder, Chairman of the All-India Student Federation, who urged the delegates to strengthen unity. He said that students should strengthen their unity, not stand against each other.

　　Subsequently, representatives from student groups in Bulgaria, Bolivia, the German Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Iraq, and other countries spoke. They all supported the proposal of the French student representative to convene a meeting to achieve unity among various student groups.

　　Speakers at the afternoon session almost all called on students to oppose colonialism and fight for the national independence of all peoples.

　　At the evening session, student representatives from Iceland, Indonesia, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Madagascar, the Soviet Union, and other countries spoke. They all discussed seeking pathways that could lead to unity within the student movement, lead to mutual understanding, and eliminate existing atmospheres of mistrust. Only Freeman, the representative from the United Kingdom, attempted to place the responsibility for the current division in the student movement on the International Student Union.

　　Tumanova, head of the Soviet student delegation, called in her speech for doing everything possible to develop cooperation between the International Student Union, national student unions, and other international student organizations, as well as cooperation between national student unions. She said that we seek a path of unity, not a path that separates us, and that seeking a path of unity will build trust between us.

    世界学生代表大会继续开会
    许多国家代表主张加强团结
    据新华社布拉格29日电　第四次世界学生代表大会27日下午和晚间继续开会。
    在下午会议上第一个发言的是全印度学生联合会主席马朱姆德，他要求代表们加强团结。他说，学生们应当加强他们的团结，而不是互相对立。
    接着，保加利亚、玻利维亚、德意志民主共和国、柬埔寨、伊拉克和其他国家的学生团体代表发了言。他们都支持法国学生代表要求召开一次会议以实现各个学生团体的团结的建议。
    下午会议上的发言者差不多都号召学生们反对殖民主义、为各国人民的民族独立而斗争。
    在晚间会议上，冰岛、印度尼西亚、比利时、英国、荷兰、马达加斯加、苏联等国家的学生代表都发了言。他们都谈到关于寻求能够导向学生运动团结、导向互相谅解和消除现存的不信任气氛的道路。只有英国的代表弗里曼企图把现在学生运动分裂的责任推在国际学生联合会身上。
    苏联学生代表团团长图曼诺娃在发言中号召尽一切可能来发展国际学生联合会、各国学生联合会和其他国际学生组织之间的合作，以及各国的学生联合会之间的合作。她说，我们寻求的是团结的道路，而不是把我们分离的道路，寻求团结的道路将会建立起彼此之间的信任。
