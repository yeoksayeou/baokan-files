    Opinions on "Shandong Bank Work"
    To the Editor:
    In March of this year, I wrote an article criticizing the inaccurate and untimely statistical work of the People's Banks in Liaocheng, Laixi, and other places in Shandong Province and submitted it to the Shandong Provincial People's Bank's publication, "Shandong Bank Work." They later rejected the manuscript on the grounds that "it is inappropriate to criticize some banking units in a personal capacity." After our leadership agreed to revise it and submit the criticism in the name of the planning department, they rejected the original manuscript again on the grounds that it was not good to name names. The rejection letter stated: "Our opinion is to focus on presenting the situation and it is better not to make any specific criticisms. In the past, we have not criticized lower-level units in this way in the publication. If we do so, it may easily create resentment."
    I believe that "Shandong Bank Work's" handling of this manuscript lacks principle. If the work of some units is not done well, why can't they be named and criticized? It was already wrong that "Shandong Bank Work" had not criticized in this way in the past, and why is it still not being criticized now? Is it possible that the weapon of criticism can be easily laid down just because those being criticized "easily generate resentment"?

### 对“山东银行工作”的意见

    对“山东银行工作”的意见编辑同志：
    今年三月，我写了一篇批评山东省聊城、莱西等地人民银行的统计工作不正确、不及时的稿子，投给山东省人民银行的刊物“山东银行工作”。他们后来以“用个人名义批评一些银行单位不妥当”为理由，把稿子退回。后经我们领导上同意改用计划处名义提出批评，他们又以不好指名批评为理由退回原稿。退稿信上写着：“我们意见以摆情况为主，不对任何进行指名的批评较好。在刊物上过去没有这样对下边批评过，如果这样做，恐容易产生抵触情绪。”
    我认为，“山东银行工作”处理这篇稿件是缺乏原则性的。有些单位的工作做得不好，为什么不能指名批评？过去在“山东银行工作”上没有这样批评过已经是不对的了，现在为什么还不批评？难道因为被批评者“容易产生抵触情绪”，就轻易放下批评的武器吗？中国人民银行山东省分行　曹广森
