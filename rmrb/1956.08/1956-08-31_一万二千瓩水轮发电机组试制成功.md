Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th. Four 12,000-kilowatt large-scale hydraulic turbine generator sets (including hydraulic turbines, generators, etc.) have all been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant. These devices have been assessed and their quality meets the requirements. They have now been shipped to new hydroelectric power station construction sites one after another. The auxiliary equipment for the unit - automatic control and automatic voltage regulation, etc., will also be completed in September.

The 12,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator set was manufactured starting in September of last year, after the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant independently designed and successfully trial-produced a 10,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator set. The successful trial production of this large-scale hydraulic turbine generator set marks another step forward in China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry. Large-scale hydraulic turbine generator sets are large and complex equipment. The starting or closing of this type of large machine is automatically controlled. Because the technicians and workers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant had already basically mastered the technology of manufacturing large hydraulic turbine generator sets of around 10,000 kilowatts during the trial production of the 10,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator set last year, the difficulties encountered in the trial production of the 12,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator set were relatively easily overcome. The workers' technical level has been further improved in this manufacturing process.

    一万二千瓩水轮发电机组试制成功
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　四台一万二千瓩大型水轮发电机组（包括水轮机，发电机等），已经全部在哈尔滨电机厂试制成功。这些设备经过鉴定，质量都合乎要求，现在已经先后运往新建的水电站工地。机组的附属设备——自动控制和自动电压调整等，也将在9月份完成。
    一万二千瓩水轮发电机组，是在哈尔滨电机厂自行设计并试制成功一万瓩水轮发电机组以后，在去年9月开始制造的。这一大型水轮发电机组试制成功，标志着我国电机制造工业又向前迈进了一步。大型水轮发电机组，是一种庞大而又复杂的设备。这种大型机器的开动或关闭都是自动操纵的。哈尔滨电机厂的技术人员和工人由于在去年试制一万瓩水轮发电机组的时候，就已经基本上掌握了制造一万瓩左右的大型水轮发电机组的技术，所以在试制一万二千瓩水轮发电机组的过程中所遇到的困难就比较容易地克服了。工人们在这次制造中技术水平又得到了进一步提高。
