Preparations are now underway to equip the waiting rooms for passengers, as well as moisture-proof wood and rainproof tarpaulins for storing goods.

At large stations such as Yangping, construction or installation of water supply equipment, such as water pumps, water towers, and water pipes for locomotives, is in progress.

Temporary operational dispatch telephones, track maintenance telephones, and telephones at each station have been installed, providing direct communication from Chengdu to Baoji.
