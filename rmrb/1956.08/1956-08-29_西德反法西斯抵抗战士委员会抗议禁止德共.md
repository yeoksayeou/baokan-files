    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 27th (TASS dispatch) - The West German Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters Committee issued a statement protesting Bonn's ban on the German Communist Party.
    The statement pointed out that the ban on the German Communist Party not only caused unease among anti-fascists and victims of the Hitler regime, but also among all strata of West German residents. The statement emphasized that all forces must be united to defend freedom, democracy, and constitutional rights.
    The West Berlin Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters Committee sent a letter to West German President Heuss, protesting the ban on the German Communist Party. The letter stated that this ban not only harms Communist Party members, but also endangers all democratic forces opposing the increasing fascistization and militarization of the state.
    The West Berlin "Sozialistische Zeitung" emphasized in an editorial that the ban on the German Communist Party should not be seen merely as a measure to exclude a political party from political life. Its purpose is to gradually prohibit the activities of the Adenauer regime's opponents, whose influence is growing.

    西德反法西斯抵抗战士委员会抗议禁止德共
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社柏林27日讯：西德反法西斯抵抗战士委员会发表声明，抗议波恩禁止德国共产党。
    声明指出，禁止德国共产党不仅引起反法西斯主义者和希特勒政权的受害者的不安，而且还引起西德各居民阶层的不安。声明着重指出，必须团结一切力量来保卫自由、民主和宪法权利。
    西柏林反法西斯抵抗战士委员会寄了一封信给西德总统豪斯，抗议禁止德国共产党。这封信说，这种禁止不仅伤害共产党员，它还使一切反对国家日益法西斯化和军国主义化的民主力量都面临危险。
    西柏林“索斯报”在社论中强调指出，不能把禁止德国共产党仅仅看作是一种从政治生活中排除一个政党的措施。它的目的是要逐步禁止阿登纳政权的反对者的活动，因为这些人的影响在日益扩大。
