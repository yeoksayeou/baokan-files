Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th - A group of agricultural cooperatives in Enshi Special District, Hubei Province, conducting autumn harvest distribution pilots, have fully promoted democracy, and the distribution work has been done well and quickly.

Enshi Special District is full of towering mountains, and many cooperative members live on large mountains covering more than ten miles. It is very difficult to convene a general meeting of all members, and even more difficult to hold meetings at night. Holding meetings during the day affects production. During the summer harvest distribution this year, many regions did not actively find ways to solve this difficulty, but simply did not hold meetings, and a few people monopolized the distribution work. Because democracy was not well promoted, the policies were also poorly publicized and implemented, causing many losses to the summer harvest distribution.

In the autumn harvest distribution pilot, all counties accepted the lessons of the past and used members' representative meetings to carry out the distribution work. The representatives were able to bring up various opinions from the members for discussion and resolution. After the meeting, they were able to convey and implement the specific policies regarding various distributions to the members in the villages, effectively eliminating the ideological concerns of some members. At the same time, some people were selected at the members' representative meeting to form specialized teams such as "Yield Estimation and Acceptance Team", "Custody and Distribution Team", "Accounting and Clearing Team", and "Public Security and Defense Team", responsible for the specific work in the distribution, achieving orderliness.

When the First Cooperative of Hetao Township, Enshi County, carried out the autumn harvest distribution, it held a total of four representative meetings from the publicity and implementation of policies to the end of the distribution plan formulation. Before the representative meeting was held, some members believed that "this year the knife handle is in the hands of the cadres anyway, I don't know how much they can distribute to me," worried that the cadres would mess around and reduce their income. Later, a representative meeting was held, and the distribution work was done very well. Every member was beaming with joy.

### 恩施专区秋收分配试点证明  运用社员代表会进行分配又好又快

    恩施专区秋收分配试点证明
    运用社员代表会进行分配又好又快
    新华社武汉18日电　湖北省恩施专区进行秋收分配试点的一批农业社充分发扬民主，分配工作做得好而快。
    恩施专区到处是丛山峻岭，许多农业社的社员居住在方圆十多里的大山上，召开全体社员大会有很多困难，夜里开会更不容易，白天开会影响生产。今年夏收分配中，许多地区不是积极想办法解决这种困难，而是干脆不开会，由少数人包办分配工作，由于没有很好的发扬民主，政策也宣传贯彻得差，给夏收分配造成许多损失。
    在秋收分配试点中，各县接受了过去的教训，都运用社员代表会来进行分配工作。代表们都能把社员们的各种意见带上来，进行讨论解决，开罢会回到村里，又能把关于各项分配的具体政策向社员传达贯彻，有效的消除了部分社员的思想顾虑，同时在社员代表会上还选出一些人成立“估产验收班”、“保管分配班”、“会计清账班”、“治安保卫班”等专门班子，负责分配中的各项具体工作，做到了有条不紊。
    恩施县核桃乡第一社在进行秋收分配的时候，从宣传贯彻政策到分配方案制定结束，共开了四次代表会。在代表会召开以前，部分社员认为“今年的刀把子反正掌在干部手里，不晓得能给我分多少”，担心干部乱搞，减少自己的收入，后来召开了代表会，分配工作搞的很好，社员们个个喜笑颜开。
