Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 23rd: The “Myanmar People’s Daily” published an editorial on August 22nd stating: “If the U.S. government truly hopes to financially help the people of Myanmar, then it should not demand the ‘right to inspect accounts’ and should lower the interest rate from 3% to 2%.”

According to the newspaper's August 19th report, the Myanmar government and the U.S. government have, in principle, reached an agreement on U.S. loans, but the agreement has not been finalized because the U.S. has proposed conditions allowing the U.S. government or its representatives to inspect Myanmar's accounts to understand how the U.S. loans are being used.

The editorial said: With this "right of inspection," the United States would be able to understand the "internal situation" of the Myanmar government. The editorial also pointed out: "A 3% interest rate is too high" because loan countries usually only require a 2% interest rate.

    “缅甸人报”评论
    美国无诚意援助缅甸
    据新华社仰光23日电　“缅甸人报”八月二十二日发表社论说：“假如美国政府真正希望在财政上帮助缅甸人，那末它就不应该要求有‘检查账目的权利’，并且应该把利率从3％降低到2％。”
    据这家报纸八月十九日的消息，缅甸政府和美国政府已经在原则上商妥了关于美国贷款的协定，但是由于美国提出了允许美国政府或它的代表检查缅甸账目以了解美国贷款如何使用的条件，这项协定还没有最后确定下来。
    社论说：有了这种“检查权利”，美国就得以了解缅甸政府的“内部情况”了。这篇社论还指出：“3％的利率是太高了”，因为通常贷款国家都仅仅要2％的利率。
