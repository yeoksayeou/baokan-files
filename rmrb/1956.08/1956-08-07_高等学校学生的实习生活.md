    Internship Life of University Students
    University Students are Just Like Workers
    The internship team of Class 113-1 of Harbin Institute of Technology worked with a youth mixed shock brigade of the Third District of Harbin Construction Engineering Company. When they first arrived, everyone was unfamiliar, and the shock brigade members thought they were college students, so they felt a little difficult to approach. The students in this internship team anticipated this, so as soon as they arrived at the construction site, they rushed to do the work and supplied whatever was needed. Soon, these college students became very close with them. The shock brigade members said, "University students are just as capable as workers!" They boldly entrusted the work to the students.
    A Little Nervous
    Zhang Chongfu, a student from Nanjing Institute of Technology, was assigned to the construction site for on-site measurement as soon as he started his internship. When he leveled the instrument, he felt very nervous, because as soon as he announced the measurement results, the workers would immediately use it as a basis for their work. If he made a mistake, it would affect the quality of the project. He was vigilant and carefully measured, and his classmates encouraged him. He finally completed a measurement and re-measured it, and there were no errors. He watched the workers construct according to the lines he measured, and a happy smile appeared on his face.
    Study Hard with the Master
    After a week of study, the students of Class 530 of the East China Institute of Chemical Technology basically mastered the work content of the workshop. They officially started operating. When they put on their work clothes, everyone's face showed a smile. The female students looked in the mirror again and again, asking each other, "Do I look like a worker?" They became apprentices, and before entering the workshop, they encouraged each other, "Hey! Study hard with the master and do more work."
    Solved the Automatic Sand Falling Problem
    The students from Tsinghua University who interned in the casting workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant explored some good experiences, successfully completed the first batch of individual assignments, and submitted drawings one after another. Two students solved an automatic sand falling problem for the workshop's conveyor belt, designing and drawing a complete set of drawings. The teachers invited Soviet casting experts and the workshop's engineers, foremen, and workers to conduct a defense with the students. The students answered well and were praised by the Soviet experts and workshop comrades. The Soviet experts also asked the students to copy a set of drawings for him, preparing to take them back to their country. The workshop leaders also stated that they would strive to start construction on the first batch of individual assignment drawings as soon as possible. The students are working hard to contribute to the production of domestically produced cars.
    The First Sunday
    Only with tense labor can there be relaxed rest, which the students of the Tangshan Railway Institute's Dalian internship team truly experienced. On the first Sunday after the internship, they wiped off the grease from their hands, washed away the smoke and dust from their faces and the sweat from their bodies, put on beautiful clothes, and stepped onto the wide and flat asphalt road to visit the Dalian scenic area. They were most interested in the sea and liked to jump into the sea to swim. Some students were swimming in the sea for the first time in their lives. Some people went to the park, watched movies, visited the Soviet Army Memorial Tower... Everyone had fun and rested their bodies appropriately in order to welcome the tense worker life of tomorrow.
     Rewarded
    Zhang Xingqi, a student from the Mining Area Development Department of Hefei Mining Institute, conducted a production internship at the Datong Coal Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau and found that the recovery method of the mine's roof beams needed to be improved. Based on his knowledge and the information collected during the internship, he studied and proposed suggestions to the mine leaders to improve the roof beam recovery method, which increased the roof beam recovery rate by 20%. The leaders of Datong Coal Mine gave Zhang Xingqi a material reward for this. (Attached picture)
    Students from the Biology Departments of Peking University, Fudan University, and Nankai University interned at the Anyang Cotton Field in Henan, studying the breeding conditions and hazards of various cotton insects in the field.

    高等学校学生的实习生活
    大学生同工人一样
    哈尔滨工业大学113—1班的实习队，在哈尔滨市建筑工程公司的第三区，跟砖工组一个青年混合突击队一起工作。他们初到的时候，大家都很陌生，突击队员们认为他们是大学生，总觉得有点不好接近。这个实习队的学生们预料到这一点，一进工地就抢着干活，工作需要什么就供应什么。很快，这些大学生跟他们搞得很亲切了。突击队员们说：“大学生也同工人一样能干！”他们就大胆地把活交给学生们做了。
    有点紧张
    南京工学院的学生张崇馥刚开始实习时，就被派到施工工地去实地测量。当他把仪器定平的时候，情绪非常紧张，因为只要他一说出测量的结果，工人们就会立即把它作为依据来进行工作，万一测错了，那就影响工程的质量。他警惕着，细心地测量，同学也都鼓励他。他终于测完了一次，并且又复测了一遍，没有错误。他眼看着工人们照他所测量的线施工了，不由得露出愉快的笑容。
    好好地跟师傅学习
    经过一星期的学习，华东化工学院530班实习队的学生们都基本上掌握了车间的工作内容。他们就正式开始操作。当他们穿上工作服的时候，每个人的脸上都露出笑容，女学生们一遍又一遍地照着镜子，相互问着：“看我的样子，像个工人吗”？他们当上了徒工，在即将进入车间以前，都互相勉励着“喂！要好好跟师傅学习，多干些活儿”。
    解决了自动落砂问题
    在第一汽车制造厂铸工车间实习的清华大学的学生们，摸索出了一些较好的经验，出色地完成了第一批个人作业，并陆续交出了图纸。有两个学生为车间解决了一项传送带的自动落砂问题，设计并绘制出全套图纸。教师邀请了苏联铸工专家和车间的工程师、工长、工人们，同学生进行了答辩。学生们答得很好，受到了苏联专家和车间同志们的赞许。苏联专家还要求学生为他复制一份图纸，准备带回国去。车间领导同志也表示，要争取第一批个人作业的图纸尽可能早点施工。学生们都紧张地工作着，为出产国产汽车贡献自己的力量。
    第一个星期天
    只有紧张的劳动，才有轻松的休息，这一点，唐山铁道学院大连实习队的学生们真正地体会到了。实习后的第一个星期天，他们擦尽双手的油垢，冲洗去满脸的烟尘和全身的汗，穿上漂亮的衣服，踏上了宽敞平坦的柏油马路，到大连风景区去游览。他们最感兴趣的是海，喜欢跳到海水里去洗澡。有些学生在海水里洗澡还是生平第一次。有的人去逛公园、看电影，参观苏军纪念塔……。大家尽情地玩，使身体得到适当的休息，以便迎接明天紧张的工人生活。
     受到奖励
    合肥矿业学院矿区开采系学生张兴岐在淮南矿务局大通煤矿进行生产实习，发现这个矿顶梁的回收方法还需要改进。他根据自己所学的知识和实习中收集的资料加以研究，向这个矿的领导方面提出改进顶梁回收方法的建议，使顶梁回收率提高了20％。大通煤矿领导方面为此给了张兴岐物质奖励。（附图片）
    北京大学、复旦大学、南开大学生物系的学生，到河南安阳棉场实习，在田间研究各种棉虫的繁殖情况及其危害性。
