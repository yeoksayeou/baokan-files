    Achievements of the Talks Between Vietnam and Laos

    During the visit of the Lao Royal Government Delegation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, friendly talks were held between the delegations of the Lao Royal Government and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Both sides exchanged views on issues concerning Vietnam and Laos, as well as some international issues, and issued a joint communique. This meeting made a significant contribution to promoting friendly relations between Vietnam and Laos, maintaining the Geneva Accords, and consolidating peace in Indochina.

    Vietnam and Laos are not only neighbors with traditional close friendship, but also brotherly countries that have shared hardships and difficulties. In the past decades, the people of Indochina have suffered from the scourge of Western colonialism and the disasters of aggressive wars. In order to strive for their respective national independence and peace, they have been closely dependent on each other in arduous and heroic struggles. At the Geneva Conference in 1954, their joint struggles achieved fruitful results. The Geneva Accords guaranteed their national rights such as peace, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. Therefore, the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords is the common demand and desire of the people of Indochina. The governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos clearly announced in the joint communique that the Geneva Accords must be thoroughly implemented in Laos and Vietnam. At the same time, both governments expressed satisfaction with the results achieved in the Vientiane talks held to fully implement the Geneva Accords in Laos. There is no doubt that this desire of Vietnam and Laos is fully in line with the highest interests of the people of both countries and also with the requirements of peace in Indochina.

    One of the most vicious means used by colonialists to rule the people of Indochina in the past was to create rifts and antagonism among them, so as to defeat them one by one. Even now, some people are trying to use this old trick to harm the relations between the countries of Indochina, which have already achieved independence and freedom, in order to achieve their selfish goals. Now, through this meeting, many gaps between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos have been eliminated, and mutual understanding and friendship have been enhanced. Both sides confirmed in the joint communique that relations between the two countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the inherent friendship between the two countries must be restored and developed, economic and cultural relations established, and friendly delegations exchanged; and the problems existing between the two countries should be resolved fairly and correctly through peaceful consultations. These principles agreed upon by the two governments have laid a good foundation for restoring and developing their friendly relations and solidarity and cooperation. It will further promote the common upsurge of the two countries' economies and cultures, bring happiness and prosperity to the people of the two countries, and plug the gaps for colonialist instigation.

    The Chinese people have always believed that strengthening friendly unity among Asian countries is an important factor in consolidating their respective independence and safeguarding common peace and security. Therefore, the significant achievements made in this meeting between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos, as well as the development of friendly relations established between them and the Kingdom of Cambodia, will be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. Their efforts to demand the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords will be fully supported by our people.

    越南和老挝会谈的成就
    老挝王国政府代表团在访问越南民主共和国期间，同越南民主共和国政府代表团举行了亲密的友好会谈。双方对有关越南、老挝两国的问题和一些国际问题交换了意见，并发表了联合公报。这次会谈，对于促进越南和老挝两国的友好关系、维护日内瓦协议、巩固印度支那和平作出了重大贡献。
    越南和老挝不但是具有传统的亲密友谊的邻国，并且是曾经同艰苦、共患难的兄弟之邦。在过去的数十年中，印度支那各国人民遭到西方殖民主义的祸害和侵略战争的灾难。为了争取各自的民族独立和争取和平，他们一直唇齿相依地进行着艰苦和英勇的斗争。在1954年的日内瓦会议上，他们的共同斗争取得了胜利的成果。日内瓦协议保证了他们的和平、独立、统一和领土完整等各项民族权利。因此，彻底实现日内瓦协议，是印度支那各国人民当前的共同的要求和愿望。越南民主共和国政府和老挝王国政府在联合公报中明确地宣布：日内瓦协定在老挝和越南必须得到彻底的执行。同时，两国政府对于为了在老挝全部实现日内瓦协议而举行的万象会谈所取得的结果，一致表示满意。毫无疑问，越南和老挝两国这种愿望，是完全符合于两国人民的最高利益的，也是符合印度支那的和平要求的。
    殖民主义者过去统治印度支那各国人民的最恶毒的手段之一，就是在他们之间制造隔阂和对立，以利于各个击破。直到现在，还有人企图利用这种老手段，来损害已经取得了独立和自由的印度支那各国之间的关系，以达到它们自私的目的。现在，通过这次会谈，越南民主共和国和老挝王国之间消除了许多隔阂，增进了相互之间的了解和友谊。双方在联合公报中确认：两国之间的关系应以和平共处五项原则为基础；两国之间必须恢复和发展固有的友谊，建立经济、文化关系并交换友好代表团；两国之间所存在的问题应该通过和平协商的方法来求得公平和正确的解决。两国政府所商定的这些原则，为恢复和发展它们之间的友好关系和团结合作打下了良好的基础。而且将更加促进两国经济和文化的共同高涨，给两国人民带来幸福和繁荣，并堵塞殖民主义挑拨离间的空隙。
    中国人民一向认为，亚洲各国之间加强友好团结，是巩固各自的独立和维护共同的和平和安全的重要的因素。因此，越南民主共和国和老挝王国这次会谈所取得的重大成就，以及它们和柬埔寨王国之间所建立的友好关系的发展，都将受到中国人民热烈的欢迎。它们所表示的要求彻底执行日内瓦协议的努力，将受到我国人民的全力支持。
