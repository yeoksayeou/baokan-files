Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 30th: The Fourth World Student Congress concluded its discussion of the first agenda item at the plenary session on the evening of the 28th. Starting from the afternoon of the 29th, the congress moved into the discussion stage of the subcommittees.

The Executive Chairman of the meeting, Mr. Bellicon, pointed out before the adjournment that although there were various opinions during the discussion, it showed that students from various countries could find many common points.

The vast majority of student representatives from various countries who spoke during the two and a half days of general discussions reflected the desire to eliminate the division and antagonism in the world student movement formed in the atmosphere of the Cold War and to promote cooperation and solidarity among students from various countries.

Colonialism was fiercely criticized by student representatives from various countries, especially those from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. No representative from Asian, African, and Latin American countries failed to point out in their speeches the disasters and sufferings brought to students in their countries by the oppression of colonialism.

The Egyptian student representative described at the night meeting on the 28th the determination of Egyptian students to oppose colonialism and defend the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, and the conference supported his speech with stormy applause.

However, it can already be seen that the actions of a very small number of people in the meeting are contrary to the desire for world student solidarity and co-operation. Among the observers from the National Union of Students of England, Wales and North Ireland, the Canadian National Federation of College and University Students, and the Amsterdam Student Council of the Netherlands, some seem to be far more interested in attacking the political and educational systems of the people's democratic countries than in the achievements of the conference and the concern for world student solidarity. When the student representatives of Israel and Syria had verbal conflicts on the morning and afternoon of the 28th because of the dispute between Israel and Arab countries, they repeatedly stirred up trouble, so that the meeting was once in chaos.

However, after vigorous mediation by a committee designated by the presidium of the conference (including Chinese student representatives), the representatives of Israel and Syria finally announced that they agreed not to discuss the dispute between Israel and Arab countries at this student conference. The conference warmly welcomed the satisfactory resolution of the dispute between the representatives of the two countries.

The President of the Canadian National Federation of College and University Students, Martin, spoke at the meeting on the 28th. According to him, he also supports the struggle against colonialism, but then he lumped Tibet together with West Irian, Goa, and Algeria as examples of colonies subjected to colonial oppression.

Ke Zaishuo, a member of the Chinese delegation, immediately on behalf of the Chinese student delegation sternly pointed out the absurdity of Martin's remarks. Ke Zaishuo said that everyone with a little historical common sense knows that Tibet has always been a part of Chinese territory. Today, the Tibetan people, together with the Han, Mongolian, Uyghur and other ethnic groups, are united in the big family of the People's Republic of China. Martin's statement can only make Chinese students think that this is an unfriendly expression towards the Chinese people and students, and cannot but arouse the indignation of Chinese students. Ke Zaishuo said that if Martin wants to get more knowledge in this regard, we welcome him to discuss it with us later.

The behavior of some observers from the National Union of Students of England, Wales and Northern Ireland was also very special at the meeting. They even sat in their seats drinking and playing dice during the meeting.

At the night meeting on the 28th, the speech of the Brazilian student representative also caused incomprehension among those present. On the one hand, he condemned imperialism, colonialism, and monopoly capital that plundered Brazil's national resources, and on the other hand, he said that Brazilian students could not cooperate with students from socialist countries because there was "no democratic freedom" there.

Subsequently, the Bulgarian representative spoke. He invited the Brazilian delegation to visit Bulgaria in order to have a more direct understanding of life in Bulgaria. The Polish student representative also suggested on behalf of the Polish student delegation to meet with the Brazilian delegation and discuss any issues that the Brazilian students were interested in.

    世界学生代表大会结束第一项议程的讨论
    绝大多数代表主张促进世界学生运动团结
    极少数的人兴风作浪制造分裂和冲突诬蔑人民民主制度
    据新华社布拉格30日电　第四次世界学生代表大会在28日夜间的全体会议上结束了关于第一项议程的讨论。从29日下午开始大会转入小组委员会的讨论阶段。
    会议的执行主席贝利康在休会以前指出，会议虽然在讨论中有各种不同的意见，但是讨论却显示了各国学生是可以找到许多共同点的。
    在两天半的大会讨论中发言的绝大多数各国学生代表，都反映了要求消除在冷战的国际气氛中形成的世界学生运动的分裂和对立状态，以及促进各国学生之间的合作和团结的愿望。
    殖民主义受到了各国学生代表，尤其是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的学生代表的猛烈抨击。亚非和拉丁美洲国家的代表没有一个不在他们的发言中指责殖民主义的压迫给他们国家学生带来的灾难和痛苦。
      埃及学生代表在28日夜间会议上叙述了埃及学生反对殖民主义和保卫苏彝士运河公司国有化的决心，大会以暴风雨般的掌声支持他的发言。
    但是，已经可以看到会场上有极少数的人的作为是同世界学生团结和合作的愿望背道而驰的。在英格兰、威尔士及北爱尔兰全国大学生联合会，加拿大全国大学生联合会和荷兰阿姆斯特丹学生会议的观察员中，有一些人似乎对于攻击人民民主国家的政治制度和教育制度的兴趣大大超过对于大会的成就和对世界学生团结的关心。当以色列和叙利亚的学生代表在28日上午和下午的会议上因为谈到以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的争端而发生言语冲突的时候，他们一再地兴风作浪，以致会议曾一度陷于混乱。
    但是，经过大会主席团所指定的一个委员会（其中包括中国学生代表）的大力调解以后，以色列和叙利亚的代表最后宣布他们同意不再在这个学生会议上谈论以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的争端问题。大会热烈地欢迎这两个国家代表的纠纷得到圆满的解决。
    加拿大全国大学生联合会主席马丁在28日的会议上发了言。据他说，他也支持反对殖民主义的斗争，但是他接着就把西藏同西伊里安、果阿和阿尔及利亚混为一谈，作为受到殖民压迫的殖民地的例子。
    中国代表团团员柯在铄当即代表中国学生代表团严正地指出马丁的这种言论的荒谬。柯在铄说，每一个稍有历史常识的人都知道西藏从来就是中国领土的一部分。今天藏族人民和汉、蒙、维吾尔等族人民一起团结在中华人民共和国的大家庭里。马丁的这种说法只能使中国学生认为这是对中国人民和学生不友好的表示，不能不引起中国学生的愤慨。柯在铄说，如果马丁希望得到这方面的更多的知识的话，我们欢迎他会后来和我们讨论。
    英格兰、威尔士及北爱尔兰全国大学生联合会的某些观察员的作风在会议中也很特殊，他们甚至在会议进行期间坐在席位上饮酒和玩骰子。
    在28日夜间会议上，巴西学生代表的发言也引起到会者的不解。他一方面谴责掠夺巴西国家富源的帝国主义、殖民主义和垄断资本，另一方面又说，巴西学生不能同社会主义阵营各国的学生合作，因为那里“没有民主自由”。
    随后，保加利亚代表发言。他邀请巴西代表团访问保加利亚，以便更直接地了解保加利亚国内生活。波兰学生代表也以波兰学生代表团的名义建议同巴西代表团聚会，同他们讨论巴西学生所感兴趣的任何问题。
