    Utilize Earth, Wood, and Brickwork to Save Steel and Cement

    Using Flagstone to Build Bridges
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is extensively using flagstone to replace concrete in bridge construction. According to inspections of completed bridges, the quality of bridges built with flagstone is as good as that of concrete bridges. This year, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will use flagstone to build over forty bridges of various sizes, saving the country 1,200 tons of cement.
    Building bridges with flagstone requires only a small amount of cement mixed into mortar to set the stones in place, one by one. Therefore, it saves more than half the cement compared to building with concrete. Flagstone consists of rocks blasted from mountains during quarrying and can be used for bridge construction without further processing, making the cost lower than that of ordinary stone bridges. This method of saving wealth for the country was successfully developed through repeated research by the technical personnel constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

    Using Bricks to Build Floor Slabs
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A three-story agricultural experiment station currently under construction in the suburbs of Shenyang will have its floor slabs built with bricks. This 3,100-square-meter building, by using brick arch floor slabs instead of reinforced concrete floor slabs, can save 19 tons of steel and 46 tons of cement. The cost per square meter of floor slab can be reduced by 20% compared to reinforced concrete floor slabs.
    These brick arch floor slabs are circular when viewed from below. However, the top is flat and level because it is filled with cinders. Tests have proven that the maximum load capacity of this type of floor slab is two tons per square meter, which exceeds the load capacity of ordinary reinforced concrete floor slabs. Therefore, it is perfectly suitable for general civil buildings.
    This agricultural experiment station, built with brick arch floor slabs, was designed by the Liaoning Provincial Urban Design Institute. This institute has recently used this type of brick arch floor slab in the designs for the Jinzhou Petroleum Technical School dormitory and the Fushun Post Office office building.

    Using Wood to Make Water Pipes
    This newspaper reports: The Shashi Township Woodware Handicraft Production Cooperative in Haining County, Zhejiang Province, recently trial-produced a batch of wooden water pipes for the Haining County Electric Irrigation Committee. After testing, these wooden pipes can completely replace iron pipes, and the cost is 35% lower than that of iron pipes. A pipe of the same specifications costs 150 yuan if made of iron, but only about 103 yuan if made of wood. Now, this handicraft production cooperative has signed another contract with the Haining County Electric Irrigation Committee for another batch of wooden water pipes. Haining County is preparing to use wooden water pipes for 80% of its water pumps, which will save more than 30,000 jin of steel. (Cheng Wei)

    Using Clay to Make Sanitary Pipes
    This newspaper reports: Wang Dehou, an engineer at the Wuhan City Architectural Design Institute, suggested using clay pipes instead of ferrous metal pipes as piping for indoor sanitary facilities in civil engineering projects. This suggestion has been successfully tested multiple times. In the first two quarters of this year, they tried it in one hundred and thirty-five projects with good results. When designing the three-story employee family housing for the Central South Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, they used this method for the first time, saving more than 130,000 yuan. Originally, some people were worried that indoor clay pipes would leak, but trial results proved that the effectiveness of clay pipes is the same as that of metal pipes.
    Currently, some projects in Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and other places have also adopted clay pipes when designing piping for indoor sanitary facilities. (Liao Fabin)

    利用土木砖石，节约钢材水泥
    用片石修桥
    新华社讯　兰新铁路工地正在大量采用片石代替混凝土修桥。根据对已经完工的桥梁的检查，用片石修桥，工程质量和混凝土桥一样良好。兰新铁路今年共要用片石修筑四十几座大小桥梁，可以为国家节省一千二百吨水泥。
    用片石修桥，只需用较少的水泥拌成灰浆，把片石一块一块砌起来。因此，比用混凝土修桥可以节省水泥一半以上。片石是开山的时候爆破下来的石块，不要加工就可以用来修桥，所以造价比一般石桥还低廉。这种为国家节省财富的方法，是建设兰新铁路的技术人员经过反复的研究获得成功的。
    用砖砌楼板
    新华社讯　正在沈阳市郊兴建的一座三层楼高的农业试验站，它的楼板将用砖来砌筑。这座三千一百平方公尺的建筑物，利用砖拱楼板来代替钢筋混凝土楼板，可以节省钢筋十九吨、水泥四十六吨。每平方公尺楼板的造价，比起钢筋混凝土楼板可以降低20％。
    这种砖拱楼板在下面看是圆形的。但是，它的上面因为用煤渣垫平，仍然还是平平坦坦。试验证明，这种楼板每平方公尺的最大负荷量为两吨，可以超过一般钢筋混凝土楼板的负荷量。因此，一般民用建筑采用这种楼板是完全可以的。
    这座采用砖拱楼板兴建的农业试验站，是辽宁省城市设计院设计的。这个设计院最近又采用这种砖拱楼板设计出了锦州石油技工学校宿舍、抚顺邮局办公楼等楼房图。
    用木头做水管
    本报讯　浙江省海宁县硖石镇木器手工业生产合作社最近给海宁县电力灌溉委员会试制了一批木制抽水机水管，经试验，完全可以代替铁制水管使用，成本比铁制的水管低35％。同样规格的管子，铁制的要一百五十元，木制的只需一百零三元左右。现在，这个手工业生产合作社又和海宁县电力灌溉委员会签订另一批木制水管合同。海宁县已准备把80％的抽水机都采用木制水管，这样，将能节约三万多斤钢材。　（程伟）
    用陶土做卫生管
    本报讯　武汉市城市建筑设计院工程师王德厚，建议用陶土管代替黑色金属管，作为民用建筑工程室内卫生设备的配管。这个建议经过多次试验，已经成功了。今年前两个季度他们在一百三十五项工程中试用，效果很好。在设计中南煤田地质勘探局的三层职工眷属住宅的时候，第一次试用这个办法，节约了十三万多元。原来有人担心在室内装陶土管会漏水，试用结果证明，陶土管的功效和金属管相同。
    现在，湖南、江西、河南等地的某些工程，在设计室内卫生设备的配管的时候，也采用了陶土管。
