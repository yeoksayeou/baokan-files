Lingbei waters depart, the Yellow River swells
Lingnan waters depart, the river rises in tide (excerpt from Ke Zhongping's poem)

Our journey across the Qinling Mountains marked our transition from the Yellow River basin to the Yangtze River region, also signifying a geographical division between northern and southern China.

Donghe Town in Feng County, situated at the southern mouth of the Qinling Mountains, is home to over two hundred households. While wheat in Guanzhong had already been harvested, here the wheat fields remained green, with agricultural seasons lagging behind the Guanzhong Plain and Chengdu Plain by one to two months.

The Jialing River, originating from nearby Dongyu Gully, was merely an ankle-deep stream at this point. However, in its middle and lower reaches, it transforms into a wide and mighty river, flowing over a thousand kilometers to meet the Yangtze River in Chongqing.

Crossing the Lingguan Gorge

South of the Donghe Bridge, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway meanders along the banks of the Jialing River. It alternately runs along the left and right sides of the river, crossing the turbulent waters sixteen times. After passing Shuangshipu in Feng County, the river source widens slightly, and the railway and river twist together, entering the perilous Lingguan Gorge. The continuous mountain ranges stand like hundreds of screens on both sides of the Jialing River. The surging river, squeezed through the narrow gorge only one or two zhang wide, struggles and roars towards Gansu and Sichuan.

Within Lingguan Gorge, steep cliffs block the sky, and the river surges. Since ancient times, countless travelers have perished in the whirlpools of this "mass grave" and "human boiling pot." People on opposite sides of the river, though able to talk to each other from the mountain peaks, could not travel between. In Pipayan, at the junction of Shaanxi and Gansu, there is a legend: A woodcutter played the pipa on the mountain, and the music was carried by the breeze to the opposite bank. A girl cutting grass on the opposite mountain heard the music and couldn't help but sing along. From then on, the mournful songs floated from Pipaling day and night, conveying the thoughts and admiration of the lovers. But the cliffs and rapids prevented them from meeting....

Today, trains miraculously appear in the gorge, running along the towering mountains beside the river and passing through tunnels. Three kilometers out of the four-kilometer route are tunnels. Although a railway has been built here, its presence is still invisible from the outside. The local farmers' folk songs praise these amazing changes:

"Only heard the old stories, speaking of immortals,
Today building the railway, only then see the face of the immortals."

However, these changes are not the work of immortals, but the creation of the railway workers. For example, the tunnel on Monkey Rock was originally a steep peak that even monkeys could hardly climb. When the railway workers first arrived, they were at a loss because the mountain was too high and steep to climb. But how could heroes who had scaled countless mountains in the past few years be stopped by this mountain?

During discussions, everyone said, "To get up there, we have to tie a rope on the cliff!"

But how could a rope be tied on a barren rock peak?

"If you're afraid of the mountain, what kind of mountain opener are you!" Communist Party member Zhang Xikui stood up and guaranteed to the Party branch that he would be the first to climb the peak. As he spoke, he picked up an axe and a rope, and along the bare stone wall, he dug out footholds one by one. Then, he climbed the stone footholds towards the high cliff. By the time he reached the halfway point, his clothes were soaked with sweat, his chest and abdomen were bleeding, and his legs were weak. How much he wanted to stop and rest! However, hearing the cheers of his comrades below and thinking that this was the key project for opening the railway, he finally mustered his last bit of strength and climbed to the top of the sixty-meter-high rock, tying the first rope for the railway-building army. The workers then pulled on this rope, clinging to the cliff, and used steel drills and explosives to split the rock face, creating the tunnel that exists today.

Advancing Towards the Huangsha River

From Lingguan Gorge south to the Huangsha River in Gansu, the journey along the valley is more than fifty kilometers. From dawn to dusk, the sound of steel drills, wind drills, and earth-shattering explosions echoed day and night. Hearing the sound of blasting mountains, I recalled the wars of the past. Although it was the same soldiers, the wind drills had replaced the machine guns. Yesterday they charged on the battlefield to defend the motherland, and today they are active on the smoke-filled hills to build the motherland.

At dusk on June 17, as the moon rose from behind the mountains, I walked along the banks of the Jialing River towards the most intense construction site from Zhan'erxiang to Hekou. The lights strung for more than ten miles, like stars in the Milky Way, hung over the construction site. Under the shining lights, the tunnels, roadbeds, and river beaches were bustling with people, with red flags of labor competitions erected everywhere. Countless sweat-drenched faces flashed in the dim night. They forgot their fatigue and exhaustion, and didn't feel the cold night wind blowing. They were advancing towards the Huangsha River as if it were daytime!

At the entrance of the new No. 2 tunnel, I met Bai Yifu, a combat hero who is now an engineering team leader. Like commanding battles in the past, he stood in the glare of the searchlight, holding a flag in his hand, blowing a whistle, and shouting orders to the youth shock brigade to rescue the collapse. Seven years ago, it was this team that wiped out a fleeing Hu Zongnan army on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border, suppressed bandits in northern Sichuan, and then went to resist the United States and aid Korea. After completing the Fengtai-Shacheng Railway, they transferred to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, taking on the final project. After years of training, they have now become an excellent engineering team.

Here, although they had already repaired more than 30,000 collapses day and night, they kept repairing and collapsing. The giant rocks and quicksand from the mountains continued to roll down. Therefore, the workers often dispersed alertly according to the signals of the "observation post," and then gathered again, attacking the collapse repeatedly dozens, even hundreds of times, like charging on the battlefield.

There were eight or nine hundred similar collapses along the entire line. The shifting landslides, the broken and cracked rocks, the falling stones from the cracks, as Soviet geological and hydrological experts said, are rare in the world! And the continuous heavy rains and unprecedented floods brought unimaginable difficulties to the construction in this volcanic and seismic area.

"The people of the whole country are watching us, we can't be an obstacle to the opening of the railway!" The workers heard the train whistles of the track-laying and bridge-building teams behind them, and they all ran around anxiously. More than 10,000 employees were mobilized tensely, working in three shifts continuously, with time calculated in minutes and seconds. Finally, countless collapse obstacles were cleared, and the tunnels, roadbeds, and steel rails were extended forward overnight.

Looking ahead, the distance was only thirty li, twenty li, fifteen li. But suddenly, heavy rain poured down, thunder followed lightning, the swollen river impacted both banks, and the entire construction site became a hazy mess. Bridges were washed away, and the collected gravel and materials were swept away.... Shouts from all directions shook the sky, and the railway-building army once again faced the most serious test.

During the days of flooding, thousands of workers isolated on the opposite bank of the river worked in the rain during the day and slept under tarpaulins and cement bags in tunnels, stone caves, and under trees at night. Although they had not had blankets or vegetables for several days, and each person could only eat three or four liang of rice porridge a day, their eyes were red and swollen, but everyone was in good spirits. A youth shock team leader named Zhang Fenggang sang songs and shouted slogans, leading his team to mix four hundred and eighty pans of concrete and carry more than nine hundred loads of gravel in one day, increasing efficiency by a factor of two. When clearing the silt from the tunnel entrance, they couldn't use shovels or baskets, so they ran barefoot into the ground and pushed the slurry to the riverbank with their bare hands. In order to erect a rope to the opposite bank, Zhang Fenggang also crossed the river seven times to pull the ferry line. Later, these steel wires were used to transport food, materials, and vegetables, relieving the siege and conquering the flood, allowing the track-laying and bridge-building teams to pass through this section smoothly.

    岭南水去江起潮
    ——从宝鸡到成都之三
    本报记者　纪希晨
    岭北水去黄河涨　岭南水去江起潮　（摘柯仲平的诗）
    秦岭是黄河、长江的分水岭，也是我国南北地理的分界线。一翻过秦岭，我们就从黄河流域进入了长江地带。
    秦岭南口的凤县东河镇，有两百多户居民。关中麦子早已收获了，可是这里的麦子还是一片青色，农事季节比关中平原和成都平原要晚一个月至两个月。
    发源于附近东裕沟的嘉陵江，在这里只不过是深及脚踝的小溪，但到了中、下游，却变成宽阔浩荡的江河，流经一千多公里，在重庆同长江会合。
    横渡灵官峡
    从东河桥向南，宝成铁路一直沿着嘉陵江畔迂回而下。时而在江的左边，时而又伸延到右岸，先后十六次跨过汹涌的江面。过了凤县双石铺一段，河源稍为开阔，铁路同江流拧在一起，一齐交错钻入天险灵官峡。连绵起伏的山峦，好似几百座屏风，兀立在嘉陵江两岸。奔腾的江水，射过宽仅一、二丈的峡谷，挣扎怒吼着奔向甘肃、四川。
    灵官峡内峭壁遮天，江流澎湃，自古不知有多少旅人葬身在这“万人坑”、“煮人锅”的漩涡里面。江这一岸的人跟江那一岸的人，虽然彼此在山头上可以相对说话，但却不能往来。陕、甘交界处的琵琶岩，就流传这样一个传说：有一个砍柴的青年，在山上弹奏琵琶，琴声被清风送到对岸，一个对面山上割草的姑娘，听到琴音，情不自禁地随和高歌起来。从此以后，琵琶岭日夜飘起幽怨的歌声，传送着情人们的心思和爱慕。可是峭壁和激流挡住他们不能会见……。
    今天，火车沿着江边摩天的山峰，穿过一个个隧洞，奇迹似的出现在峡谷中。四公里的线路就有三公里是隧洞。虽然这里已修起了铁路，可是从外面仍然看不见铁路的影踪。对于这些神妙的变化，当地农民流传的民歌中曾这样歌颂：
    “只听古话传，言说有神仙，
    今天修铁路，才见神仙面，”
    但是，这些变化不是出自神仙，而是出自筑路工人的双手。例如，那个猴子岩上的隧洞，原来是连猴子也难攀登上去的陡峰。最初筑路工人来到这里，也因为山太高陡，爬不上去，急得大家干瞪眼睛。但是，几年来，脚下曾经翻登过无数山峰的英雄，岂能被这座山挡住？
    讨论的时候，大家说：“要上去，除非在悬岩上拴根绳！”
    可是，绳子怎样才能拴在草木不生的岩峰上？
    “怕山高，还当什么开山工！”共产党员张喜魁站起来向党支部提出保证，报名要第一个登上山峰。说着，他拿起一把斧子，一条绳子，沿着光秃秃的石壁，一步一个地在石岩上掏凿立足的钵子。然后再攀登着石钵，向高岩爬去。到了半山腰时，衣服被汗湿透了，胸腹也划出血了，双腿也发软了。那时候，他多想停下来歇一歇呵！可是，一听到山下同志们的欢呼声，一想到这是通车的关键工程，终于鼓起最后一把劲，登上了六十公尺高的岩顶，为筑路大军拴起了第一根绳子。工人们就拉着这条绳子，贴身绝壁，用钢钎、炸药劈开石壁，修出了现在的洞子。
    向黄沙河挺进
    从灵官峡向南到甘肃黄沙河，沿山谷行走五十多公里，从黎明到黄昏，日夜都响着钢钎声，风钻声，和地动山摇的炮声。听到炸山的炮声，我回忆起往日的战争。虽然同样是那些战士，可是，风钻已代替了机枪。昨天他们为保卫祖国冲锋在战场，今天为建设祖国，他们又活跃在硝烟弥漫的山岗上。
    六月十七日黄昏，当月亮从山后升起时，我沿着嘉陵江畔，走向最紧张的站儿巷到河口的工地。连绵十数里的电灯，像天河上的繁星，悬挂在工地的上空。灯光辉照下，隧洞里，路基上，河滩里，到处都奔忙着人群，竖立着劳动竞赛的红旗，无数张淌着汗水的脸孔，在夜光蒙蒙里，闪来闪去。他们忘记了劳累和疲倦，不觉得深夜的寒风吹袭，在黑夜也像白天一样，向黄沙河进军！
    在新二号洞口，我见到了战斗英雄、现在是工程队长的柏一夫同志。他像过去指挥战斗一样，站在探照灯的光芒里，手拿着旗子，嘴里吹着哨子，扯着嘶哑的喉咙，在人声喧嚷中，向青年突击队员们喊着抢救塌方的口令。七年以前，正是他们这支队伍，在川陕界上消灭了一部南逃的胡宗南军队，清剿了川北的土匪，后来又去抗美援朝；在修起丰沙铁路以后，又转到宝成铁路上，担任最后的工程。经过几年锻炼，现在他们已成为一支优秀的工程队伍。
    在这里，他们虽然已经日夜不息的抢修了三万多塌方，可是，抢了又塌，塌了又抢，山上的巨石、流沙还是不住往下滚。因之，工人们常常随着“观察哨”的信号，忽而机警地散开，忽而又聚拢前来，像战场冲锋似的，反复几十次，几百次地向塌方进行攻击。
    类似这种塌方，全线有八、九百起，那沙沙移动的滑坡，那破碎崩裂的山岩，那裂口崩坠的飞石，正如苏联地质水文专家所说：在全世界都是少见的！而连绵不断的暴雨，百年未有的洪水，更给这一带火山地震区的施工，带来难以想像的困难。
    “全国人民都在瞧着咱们，咱们可不当通车障碍！”工人们听见后面铺轨架桥队的列车鸣叫，大家都焦灼地奔走相告。一万多职工全都紧张地动员起来，日夜分三班连续工作，时间以分、秒计算。终于清除了无数塌方障碍，把隧洞、路基、钢轨连夜向前伸延。
    眼看相距只有三十里，二十里，十五里了。可是，暴雨突然倾倒下来，雷声紧跟着闪电，暴涨的江水冲击着两岸，整个工地变成了迷混的一团，桥梁被冲断了，采集的碎石、材料被冲走了……。左右四方喊声震天，筑路大军又一次面临着最严重的考验。
    在洪水泛滥的日子里，被洪水隔绝在江对岸的数千工人，白天工作在雨地里，晚间披着蓑衣和水泥袋睡在隧洞、石穴和树林下面。他们虽然一连几天没有被盖，没有蔬菜，每个人一天只能吃三、四两米的稀饭，眼睛熬得都红肿起来，可是，大家心情却是愉快的。一个叫作张风岗的青年突击队长，唱着歌，喊着口号，一天带领队员搅拌了四百八十盘混凝土，抬了九百多挑碎碴，把效率提高一倍。清除洞口稀泥时，铁锹不能铲，筐子不能抬，他们便赤身跑到地下，用双手把泥浆推滚到江边。为着架起一根绳索到对岸，张风岗还七次横拉渡江线。后来就通过这些钢丝，运来了粮食、材料和蔬菜，解救了围困的危难，征服了洪水的灾害，使铺轨架桥队顺利地通过了这一地段。
