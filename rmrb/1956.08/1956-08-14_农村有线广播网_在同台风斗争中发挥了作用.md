Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th - The rural wired radio network in Zhejiang Province has played a significant role in the fight against typhoons.

    The 16,000 loudspeakers distributed throughout the province's rural areas enabled the broad masses to receive news of the approaching typhoon three days in advance. Agricultural cooperatives equipped with loudspeakers designated specific individuals to listen to the radio day and night, closely monitoring the typhoon's movements. After hearing the typhoon warning broadcast, the Shibutou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Tangxi County immediately carried out an emergency harvest, saving more than 2,000 jin of ripe rice from damage. During the typhoon's most intense onslaught, the Cixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China used the radio network to direct the emergency rescue of seawalls, maintaining contact with various agricultural cooperatives.

    The typhoon's impact caused damage to some radio lines. Broadcasting stations in many counties and cities are now vigorously organizing repairs, and some have already resumed normal broadcasting.

    农村有线广播网
    在同台风斗争中发挥了作用
    据新华社杭州11日讯　浙江省农村有线广播网在同台风斗争中发挥了重大作用。
    分布在全省农村中的一万六千只喇叭，使广大群众在台风到来三天前就得到了消息。装有喇叭的农业社都指定专人日夜收听广播，密切注意台风动向。汤溪县石埠头村农业社听到台风警报的广播以后，立即进行抢收，使两千多斤黄熟的稻谷免受损失；在台风侵袭最剧烈的时候，中共慈溪县委利用广播网指挥抢救海塘，保持了和各个农业社的联系。
    台风的袭击，曾使有些广播线路受到了损失，现在许多县、市的广播站正在大力组织抢修，有的已恢复了正常播音。
