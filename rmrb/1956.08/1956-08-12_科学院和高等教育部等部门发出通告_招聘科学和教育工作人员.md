Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the State Technological Commission, and the State Council's Bureau of Experts issued a notice to recruit staff. The full text is as follows:

Our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly. Scientific research departments, secondary schools, universities, and industrial sectors urgently need various cadres. In order to mobilize all forces to actively participate in socialist construction, upon the instruction of the State Council, it has been decided to recruit a group of scientific researchers, translators, teachers for higher and secondary schools, educational administrators, and technicians for industrial sectors from among the unemployed intellectuals.

I. Any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has graduated from universities at home or abroad or possesses certain expertise and skills, is healthy and able to work, and is willing to participate in work but is not yet employed, may apply on their own or be introduced by personnel from state organs. After examination (or testing) and qualification, they will be assigned suitable work by the hiring department.

Among those currently employed, if they have graduated from universities at home or abroad or possess certain expertise and skills, and their current work is indeed not suited to their talents and they are being used inappropriately, and if they cannot be adjusted within their current unit and affiliated system to allow them to utilize their expertise, they may apply through their original unit or apply themselves with an introduction from their original unit. If they pass the examination (or testing), they will be assigned suitable work elsewhere.

II. From August 20th to September 20th, recruitment work will be carried out in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Kunming, Fuzhou, and other places. The recruitment work will be handled by the provincial and municipal recruitment staff committees organized by the local provincial and municipal People's Committees' education departments (bureaus) in conjunction with relevant departments.

III. Those who voluntarily apply should complete the application procedures with the provincial and municipal recruitment staff committees during the prescribed period (August 20th to September 20th) (if there is no recruitment agency in the applicant's province or city, they can complete the application procedures at a recruitment agency in a nearby city; if they are far from a recruitment agency, they can complete the application procedures by mail): fill out an application form, submit relevant educational background, work experience, and health examination certificates and photos (two copies). If they have writings, papers, or other inventions, they should submit relevant materials, which will be examined by the recruitment agencies to determine whether to hire them. When the provincial and municipal recruitment staff committees deem it necessary, they may notify applicants to participate in regular examinations (oral or written). The content of the examination will be determined by the recruitment agency based on the applicant's desired department's job requirements and their specific situation.

IV. Applicants who pass the examination (or testing) will be issued a notice by the provincial and municipal recruitment staff committees, and the relevant departments will assign work based on their knowledge, skills, and work needs, with reference to their own wishes.

V. The travel expenses for those who are determined to be hired to report to their work posts will be covered by the hiring department.
