Xinhua News Agency, August 1st. General Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held a reception this afternoon to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hosting military attaches from various countries stationed in China.

	At 4:00 PM, the guests arrived one after another. General Chen Geng, Senior General Zhang Zongxun, Senior General Li Kenong, Senior General Gan Siqi, Senior General Yang Chengwu, Senior General Hong Xuezhi, Senior General Su Zhenhua, as well as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, warmly welcomed the guests.

	Among the guests were: Soviet Military Attache Major General Zudov, Indian Military Attache Brigadier Malik, Czechoslovak Military Attache Colonel Duri, Polish Military Attache Colonel Wancesh, Burmese Military Attache Colonel Liu Dang, Bulgarian Military Attache Colonel Georgiev, and Indonesian Acting Military Attache Major Karim.

	General Chen Geng delivered a speech at the reception. He said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new type of revolutionary army. It was born from the people, and it will always be with the people. It resists the aggression of foreign aggressors, and it will never invade any country.

	Chen Geng said that after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the Chinese People's Liberation Army proposed to build the Chinese People's Liberation Army into an excellent, modernized, revolutionary army. We are always paying attention to the combat training and combat readiness of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This measure, in addition to being unfavorable to foreign aggressors who attempt to stand on the heads of the Chinese people again, is not harmful to any country that advocates peace and friendship. Not only is it not harmful, but it is also beneficial to safeguarding lasting peace in Asia and the world. I deeply know that all our friends can understand this.

	Chen Geng said that we fully agree with the Soviet government's consistent proposal to reduce armaments, ban nuclear weapons, and stop nuclear weapons testing. We also welcome India's proposal at the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting to stop testing nuclear weapons. We are proud of the fraternal friendship between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the Asian countries that initiated and implemented the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

	Chen Geng finally proposed a toast to the permanent friendship between the peoples and armies of all countries, and to lasting peace in Asia and the world.

	Indian Military Attache Brigadier Malik then spoke. He said that in his opinion, the task given to the Chinese army by the Chinese government is the same as the task given to the Indian army by the Indian government, which is to defend peace and oppose aggression. He also said that the armies of all peace-loving countries in the world are for defending their own sovereignty, opposing aggression, and defending the cause of world peace. He wished the Chinese People's Liberation Army greater victories in the cause of defending peace.

	Soviet Military Attache Major General Zudov raised a glass at the reception to congratulate the growing strength and development of the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, to wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army reliably and effectively defend its national security and socialist construction, to wish it greater achievements in defending world peace, to wish the friendship between the peoples of all countries to develop further, to wish the leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army good health, and to wish Chairman Mao Zedong good health.

	The pleasant reception lasted for two hours.

    庆祝人民解放军建军二十九周年
    陈赓副总参谋长招待各国驻华武官
    新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军副总参谋长陈赓大将，在今天下午举行了一个庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十九周年的招待会，招待各国驻中国的武官们。
    下午四时，来宾们陆续来到了。陈赓大将、张宗逊上将、李克农上将、甘泗淇上将、杨成武上将、洪学智上将、苏振华上将，以及外交部副部长姬鹏飞、国防部办公厅主任萧向荣中将，都热情地欢迎客人们。
    来宾中有：苏联武官朱道夫少将、印度武官马立克准将、捷克斯洛伐克武官杜瑞上校、波兰武官万采施上校、缅甸武官柳当上校、保加利亚武官格奥尔耶基夫上校和印度尼西亚代理武官卡里姆少校。
    陈赓大将在招待会上讲了话。他说：中国人民解放军是一支新型的、革命的军队。她从人民中诞生，她永远和人民在一起。她反抗外国侵略者的侵略，她永远也不侵略任何国家。
    陈赓说，中国人民解放军在中国人民革命胜利以后，就提出把中国人民解放军建设成为一支优良的、现代化的革命军队，我们时刻注意着中国人民解放军的战斗训练和作战准备。这种措施，除了不利于企图重新站在中国人民头上的外国侵略者以外，对于一切主张和平友好的国家都是没有任何害处的。不仅没有害处，而且对于保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平是有好处的。我深深知道，我们的一切朋友都能够了解到这一点。
    陈赓说，我们完全赞成苏联政府一贯主张的裁减军备、禁止核子武器和停止核子武器试验的建议，我们也欢迎印度在联合国裁军委员会会议上提出的停止试验核子武器的主张。我们为以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间、为创导和贯彻和平共处五项原则的亚洲各国之间的兄弟般的友谊，感到骄傲。
    陈赓最后提议，为各国人民和军队之间的永久友谊，为亚洲和世界的持久和平而干杯。
    印度武官马立克准将接着讲话。他说，在他看来，中国政府给予中国军队的任务和印度政府给予印度军队的任务是一样的，这就是保卫和平、反对侵略。他又说，世界上所有爱好和平的国家的军队，都是为了保卫自己的主权，反对侵略和保卫世界和平事业的。他祝中国人民解放军在保卫和平的事业中取得更大的胜利。
    苏联武官朱道夫少将在招待会上举杯祝贺中华人民共和国武装力量的日益壮大和发展，祝中国人民解放军可靠而有效地保卫自己的国家安全和社会主义建设，祝它在保卫世界和平事业中获得更大的成就，祝各国人民的友谊更加发展，祝中国人民解放军的领导者们的健康和祝毛泽东主席的健康。
    愉快的招待会共进行了两个小时。
