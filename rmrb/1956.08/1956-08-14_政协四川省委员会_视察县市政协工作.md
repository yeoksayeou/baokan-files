Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 12th: A inspection group from the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which was sent to the western Sichuan region to inspect the work of the city and county CPPCCs, has returned to Chengdu and recently submitted an inspection report to the committee.

    The inspection group staff spent half a month examining the work of the CPPCC organizations in Qionglai and Meishan counties. They worked with the staff of the county CPPCC organizations to comprehensively study the work of the county CPPCC organizations and summarized their work experience in political consultation, policy promotion, and contacting the masses.

    In Qionglai County, the inspection group staff found that the county CPPCC organization did not promptly reflect the opinions of the masses, and was not proactive enough in contacting relevant agencies to handle the problems raised by the masses, resulting in very few visits and letters from the masses. After pointing out this shortcoming, they suggested that the county CPPCC organization should use a variety of methods to contact the masses in the future, and formulate necessary working systems to ensure that the problems raised by the masses are seriously handled. They also introduced the experience of CPPCC organizations in other places in this regard. In Meishan County, they also discovered the same problem and raised similar opinions.

    The inspection group also found that the CPPCC organizations in these two counties lacked methods in leading learning, and the arrangement of daily work was not good enough. In addition, the political consultation work in Meishan County cannot be carried out in various ways according to the nature of the problem, often taking the form of comprehensive discussions, thus affecting the depth of problem-solving. The inspection group put forward corresponding suggestions for these problems.

    The staff of the CPPCC organizations in Qionglai and Meishan counties believe that these opinions are very pertinent and have begun to improve.

    Another inspection group is currently inspecting in northern Sichuan. In the second half of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC will continue to send inspection groups to various places to inspect.

    政协四川省委员会
    视察县市政协工作
    新华社成都12日电　中国人民政治协商会议四川省委员会派往川西地区视察市、县政协工作的一个视察组，已经回到成都，近日向委员会提出了视察报告。
    视察组工作人员先后以半个月的时间考察了邛崃、眉山两县政协工作。他们和县政协组织的工作人员一道全面地研究了县政协组织的工作，总结了在政治协商、宣传政策、联系群众等方面的工作经验。
    在邛崃县，视察组工作人员发现县政协组织反映群众意见不够及时，联系有关机关处理群众提出的问题也不够主动，以致群众来访来信很少。他们指出这一缺点后，建议县政协组织今后应该运用多种多样的方式联系群众，并制定必要的工作制度以保证认真处理群众提出的问题，他们还介绍了其他地方政协组织在这方面的经验。在眉山县，他们也发现了同样的问题，提出了类似的意见。
    视察组还发现这两县政协组织在领导学习方面缺少办法，日常工作的安排也不够好。另外眉山县的政治协商工作，还不能根据问题性质采取多种方式来进行，往往采取综合座谈的形式，因而影响到解决问题的深度。视察组对于这些问题都提出了相应的建议。
    邛崃、眉山两县政协组织工作人员认为这些意见都很中肯，并已着手改进。
    目前另一个视察组正在川北视察。今年下半年，政协四川省委员会还要陆续派出视察组到各地视察。
