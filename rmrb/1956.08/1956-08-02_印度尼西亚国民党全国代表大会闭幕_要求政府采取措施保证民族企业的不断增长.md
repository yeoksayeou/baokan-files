Xinhua News Agency, Semarang Dispatch: The Eighth National Congress of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) announced its conclusion on the evening of July 28, after a week of meetings.

At the closing reception, Sujadi, representing the PNI National Congress, announced that Suwirjo, Deputy Prime Minister in the Sukiman Cabinet of 1951 and current Chairman of the Indonesian State Industrial Bank, was elected Chairman of the PNI. Other PNI leaders elected by the Congress were: First Chairman Mangunsarkoro, Second Chairman Wilopo, Third Chairman Isa, First Secretary-General Manuhua, and Second Secretary-General Hadikusumo.

The Congress passed several resolutions on important issues related to the Indonesian economy. The resolutions called on the government to take all necessary measures to ensure the continued growth of national enterprises. Among the measures suggested were: enacting new regulations to protect the interests of national import and export merchants, restricting imports of goods that Indonesian factories can produce themselves, guaranteeing imports of materials necessary for national industries, and granting national enterprises priority in obtaining bank loans. The resolutions also demanded that the lease terms of foreign plantations should not be extended. Important mines should be gradually converted into state-owned enterprises. Foreign capital should only be allowed to obtain new mining rights when combined with national capital.

President Sukarno delivered a speech at the closing reception on July 28. He said that the PNI is not a party of the middle road, but a left-wing party. Sukarno warned populists against complacency, especially now that the PNI has become the main ruling party after the general election. He hoped that the PNI would continue to work for an independent and prosperous Indonesia.

In his speech, Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo believed that the newly elected leaders of the party symbolized the unity between the various factions within the party. He pointed out that the National Congress's expression of support for the government's foreign policy was correct, because the Congress's resolution was made at a time when there was confusion about the independent foreign policy on the international stage.

    印度尼西亚国民党全国代表大会闭幕
    要求政府采取措施保证民族企业的不断增长
    据新华社三宝垄电　印度尼西亚国民党第八次全国代表大会在举行一星期会议后，七月二十八日晚上宣布结束。
    苏亚迪代表国民党全国代表大会在闭幕招待会上宣布，1951年苏基曼内阁时的副总理、现任印度尼西亚国家工业银行董事长苏维约，当选为国民党总主席。被代表大会选出的其他国民党领袖是：第一主席曼贡萨科罗，第二主席韦洛坡，第三主席伊萨，第一总书记马努阿巴，第二总书记哈迪库苏莫。
    大会通过了一些有关印度尼西亚经济的重要问题的决议。决议要求政府采取一切必要的措施来保证民族企业的不断增长。建议采取的这些措施中包括：颁布新的法规以保障民族进出口商的利益，限制印度尼西亚自己的工厂可以生产的货物的入口，保证民族工业必需的物资的入口、以及民族企业在取得银行贷款方面将享有优先权等。决议还要求不应延长外国种植园的租地年限。重要的矿山应当逐步转变为国营企业。只有在外国资本同民族资本结合在一起的时候，外国资本才能取得新的开矿权。
    苏加诺总统在七月二十八日的闭幕招待会上发表了演说。他说，国民党不是一个中间路线的政党，而是一个左翼政党。苏加诺警告平民主义者不要自满，特别是在普选以后国民党已经变成了主要执政党的时候。他希望，国民党将继续为独立和繁荣的印度尼西亚而努力。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在他的演说中认为，党的新选出来的领袖象征着党内各派系之间的团结。他指出，全国代表大会表示支持政府的外交政策是正确的，因为代表大会的这个决议是在国际范围内对独立外交政策发生混乱的了解的时候作出的。
