    Beijing (This newspaper’s report) The Beijing Second Commercial Bureau's state-owned electrical appliance, hardware, chemical, timber, coal construction, petroleum, and trust companies, along with the general store for daily necessities, have been distributing private share dividends for the first half of this year to the joint state-private shops under their management in thirteen industries, including ground transportation vehicles (large and hand-pulled carts), auto parts, electrical appliances, mineral oil, used goods, daily-use ceramics, and bicycles, since July 27th. The distributions were completed by July 31st.

    The private shareholders expressed satisfaction upon receiving their dividends. All the private shareholders in the ground transportation vehicle materials industry unanimously stated: "In the past, our business was poorly managed, and we suffered losses every month. We are truly delighted to receive dividends today. The government truly delivers on its promises." Wang Xuexun, a private shareholder in the joint state-private Tianqiao Lumber Mill, said: "After the joint state-private partnership, our work and lives have been guaranteed. Now the government has also given us dividends. We truly don't know how to express our gratitude!" After receiving their dividends, the private shareholders in various industries sincerely expressed that they would further unite with the state representatives and employees to strive to improve the joint ventures.
                                                                                      (Wu Lutang)
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st - Joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises in Wuhan have begun distributing dividends for the first and second quarters of this year.

    Yesterday, the board of directors of the joint state-private silk and fabric industry held an expanded meeting. Private representatives from various joint state-private silk and fabric stores collected more than 16,000 yuan in dividends on behalf of more than one hundred shareholders at the meeting. Wang Fuqian, the chairman responsible for distributing the dividends, said at the meeting: "Before the joint state-private partnership in the silk and fabric industry in Wuhan, most businesses, except for a few, were losing money. They hadn't distributed dividends for many years. Now, not only has the enterprise been maintained, but the shareholders have also received dividends, and the interest rate is five percent, which is truly beyond our expectations."

    Many shareholders excitedly shared their thoughts after receiving their dividends. Yu Bochuan, a shareholder in the joint state-private Fuxing Silk and Fabric Store, said: "The state regards us as wealth and values our experience, providing us with many considerations. We must give full play to our strengths and strive to contribute to socialist transformation."

    At the end of July, the first industries in Wuhan to distribute dividends included ten commercial industries such as silk and fabric, and new medicine, as well as ten joint state-private factories such as Wuhan Lumber Mill, totaling more than 100,000 yuan in dividends. The private share dividends for all other old and new joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises will be fully distributed in August.
    Fuzhou (This newspaper’s report) - Two hundred and one private shareholders in the joint state-private cotton fabric industry in Fuzhou received a total of 8,430 yuan in private share dividends for January to June of this year at a general meeting of all private shareholders convened by the industry's working committee on July 26th. This industry was the first to implement full industry-wide joint state-private partnership in the high tide of socialist transformation in Fuzhou this January. Before the partnership, except for three large businesses that had profits, the other ninety-plus businesses almost all suffered losses year after year. From 1953 to the second half of 1954 alone, they lost 62,000 yuan. After the implementation of the full industry-wide partnership, the operating conditions have mostly improved. In the first half of this year alone, the entire industry had a surplus of more than 53,000 yuan. Now that the private shareholders have received their dividends, they are unspeakably happy and unanimously thank the Party and the government for their care. Chen Junfu, deputy director and private shareholder of Sanduo Cloth Store, said: "I started a partnership with four other investors to open the Heping Cloth Store in 1953. For more than three years before the joint partnership, I didn't receive a single dividend. At that time, the management was corrupt, the shareholders were disunited, and we lost money every year. After the partnership, in just half a year, I received 270 yuan in dividends. I truly don't know how to thank the government." Chen Shouchun, a seventy-three-year-old private shareholder and director of Xie Tai Cloth Store, is very satisfied with the care he has received in his work and life after the partnership. After receiving his dividends, he expressed his willingness to contribute all his strength to serve the people.

    新华社武汉1日电　武汉市公私合营工商企业开始发放今年第一、二季度的股息。
    昨天，公私合营绸布业董事会召开了扩大会议，各公私合营绸布商店的私方负责人在会上为一百多个股东代领了一万六千多元的股息。负责分发股息的董事长汪富谦在会上说：“武汉市绸布业在公私合营以前，除个别户有盈余以外，绝大多数是亏本户，好几年都没有分过红利，现在不但企业得到了维持，股东们还都得到了股息，而且息率是五厘，确实出乎我们意料之外。”
    很多股东领到股息以后兴奋地谈到了自己的感想。公私合营福兴绸布商店的股东余伯川说：“国家把我们看成财富，重视我们的经验，给了很多照顾，我们一定要发挥所长，争取在社会主义改造中立功。”
    七月底，武汉市首先发放股息的有绸布、新药等十个商业行业和武汉制材厂等十个公私合营工厂，共发出了股息十万元以上。其余所有新老公私合营工商企业的私股股息，将全部在八月份内发放完毕。
    本报福州电　福州市公私合营棉布业私方股东二百零一人，在七月二十六日由该业工作委员会召开的全体私股股东大会上，共领到今年一至六月份的私股股息八千四百三十多元。这个行业是在今年一月福州市社会主义改造高潮中第一个实行全行业公私合营的，在合营以前除三家大户有盈余外，其他九十多户差不多年年都要亏赔。仅1953年到1954年下半年就亏赔了六万二千元。实行全行业合营后，经营情况大多好转，单是今年上半年全行业就盈余五万三千多元。现在私方股东领到股息，心里都有说不出的高兴，一致感谢党和政府对他们的照顾。三多布店副主任、私方股东陈俊甫说：“我从1953年和四位资方合伙开设和平布店，到合营前三年多时间，一直没有领到分文的股息，那时经营腐败，股东不团结，年年赔本，合营后，只半年时间，我就领到二百七十元股息，我真不知怎样来感谢政府才好。”七十三岁的私方股东协太布店主任陈寿臣，对合营后工作上、生活上给他的照顾十分满意，分到股息后表示要贡献一切力量为人民服务。
