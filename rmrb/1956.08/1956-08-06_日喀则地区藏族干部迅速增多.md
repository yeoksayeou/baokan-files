　　Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, 5th. The Tibetan people in the Shigatse region consider participation in revolutionary work as the most glorious thing. Now, it is common for elderly parents to personally bring their children to government offices to request work. The various government offices and enterprises in Shigatse City are actively recruiting upper-class people and children of farmers and herdsmen to participate in work in accordance with the new work requirements after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

　　This year is a year of rapid growth in the number of Tibetan cadres in the Shigatse region. In the first half of the year alone, 114 Tibetan cadres participated in work in Shigatse City. In the recent months, more than 200 Tibetan cadres will continue to be recruited.

　　The CCP organizations and business departments in Shigatse have now formulated specific plans for cultivating Tibetan cadres, assigning special personnel to assist the newly participating Tibetan cadres, and requiring relevant departments to help Tibetan cadres make rapid progress politically and quickly master various aspects of professional knowledge.

　　Some Tibetan cadres who have only been working for a few months have already gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party because of their rapid political progress and increased awareness of serving their own people, and some will soon be admitted to the party. All sixteen Tibetan youths who recently joined the Shigatse People's Hospital have joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    日喀则地区藏族干部迅速增多
    新华社日喀则5日电　日喀则地区的藏族人民，把参加革命工作看作最光荣的事情。现在常常有年老的父母亲们，亲自带着自己的儿女到机关要求参加工作。日喀则市各机关和企业部门正在根据西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后新的工作要求，积极吸收上层人士和农牧民子弟参加工作。
    今年是日喀则地区藏族干部迅速增长的一年，在上半年，光在日喀则市参加工作的藏族干部就有114名，最近几个月里，将继续吸收二百多名藏族干部。
    日喀则的中共党组织和业务部门现在已经作出了培养藏族干部的具体计划，指定专人对新参加工作的藏族干部进行帮助，要求有关部门帮助藏族干部在政治上迅速进步，并使他们很快地掌握各方面的业务知识。
    现在已经有一些刚参加工作几个月的藏族干部，因为在政治上进步很快，为本民族服务的觉悟提高，光荣地参加了中国共产党，有的将要被接收入党。最近参加日喀则人民医院工作的十六个藏族青年，都已经参加了中国新民主主义青年团。
