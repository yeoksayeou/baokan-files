Xinhua News Agency, August 24th, Cairo: Cairo Radio, in a broadcast commentary on August 23rd regarding the conclusion of the London Suez Canal Conference, charged: "Dulles's attitude in London confirmed the suspicions of the vast majority of the Egyptian people: the US Secretary of State demonstrated that he was just as bellicose as his French and British colleagues. He was the conductor of this conference, and most of the singers were members of a military alliance initiated by the United States."

The Cairo Radio commentator said: "However, Dulles does not seem to realize that the majority of the world's people (including the people of the countries in the group he controls) oppose the use of force against Egypt and support the principle of resolving international disputes peacefully."

"Al-Ahram" called Dulles's plan "a viper hidden in a bouquet of flowers." It said that the plan was "an imperialist document that forcibly enslaves free people."

The newspaper pointed out that Dulles's proposal attempts to deprive Egypt of all control over the canal, "even control over receipts and expenditures."

"Al-Gomhouria" published an article by Anwar Sadat on the 23rd, saying: "Due to Egypt's absence, Western politicians accomplished nothing at the London conference. The West is determined not to learn any lessons. It should be held responsible for the dissatisfaction of small countries with it."

The widely circulated "Al-Akhbar" said that the decisions made by Western countries at the London conference cannot bind Egypt, "its value is not even worth the paper it is written on."

    开罗电台痛斥杜勒斯建议
    埃及报纸称它为奴役性的帝国主义文件
    据新华社24日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台八月二十三日在评伦敦苏彝士运河问题会议结束的一篇广播评论中指责说：“杜勒斯在伦敦的态度证实了绝大多数埃及人民的怀疑：美国国务卿表现出他自己跟他的法国和英国同事一样好战。他是这次会议的乐队指挥，而大多数演唱者都是美国发起的军事联盟的成员。”
    开罗电台的评论员说：“但是，杜勒斯似乎没有认识到世界大多数人民（包括他所控制的集团的各国人民在内）都反对对埃及使用武力，而赞成用和平方式解决国际纠纷的原则。”
    “金字塔报”把杜勒斯的计划叫做“藏在一束鲜花里面的毒蛇”。它说，这个计划是“一种强行奴役自由人民的帝国主义文件”。
    这家报纸指出，杜勒斯的建议企图剥夺埃及对运河的一切控制权，“甚至在收款和开支上的控制权”。
    “共和国报”二十三日刊载安瓦尔·萨达特的一篇文章说：“由于埃及的缺席，西方政治家们在伦敦会议上一无所成。西方坚决不肯吸取任何教训。它应该对小国家们对于它的不满意负责。”
    发行很广的“消息报”说，西方国家在伦敦会议上的决定不能约束埃及，“它的价值还不及写它的那张纸”。
