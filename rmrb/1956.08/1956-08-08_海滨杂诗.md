    Seashore Miscellany
    Zāng Kèjiā
    The sea, from the clear blue sky, saw your color, from the gusts of fresh wind, smelled your scent, touching the damp corner of my clothes, felt your warmth, waking up late at night, heard your powerful breathing.

    Meeting the evening tide, coming from the sea, the bright moon, coming from the sky, people, coming from the red buildings.

    Returning, the fiery red sun rises from the sea. The fishing boats return, the hold full of silver-scaled, dazzling fish. "Daddy---," a child jumps on the beach, the sound of the waves steals away his cheers.

    Sending Treasure, the sea sends treasure every day, the beach is covered with footprints, playing with shells in hand, faces filled with smiles. Here, regardless of adults or children, everyone is a child of nature.

    Messenger of the Sea, the fresh wind, messenger of the sea—blowing from the sea, blowing from the red tiles of the high-rise buildings, blowing from the sea-like green trees. You brush away the dust from the travelers, and dispel the stuffiness from their hearts. Qingdao, for tourists from afar, you are a green sea.

    Getting Close, we meet on the beach every morning, we don't know each other; we don't know each other, we meet on the beach every evening; the sea brings us closer, greeting each other like old friends.

    The Color of Qingdao, I want to use my own skin to bring back the color of Qingdao in summer. I let the waves wash over me, I let the sun bake me, I let the beach scorch me.

    Old Haunt, a body twenty years later, arrives at the old haunt of twenty years ago, climbs the stone building of that year and looks into the distance: the iron chains of those warships are removed [Note 1], oh sea, how freely and comfortably you breathe! Tap, tap, tap, there is no more harsh sound of wooden clogs, and those "evil birds of the season" are gone—American sailors whipping the Chinese with "civilized whips" [Note 2], our naval warriors stand guard in the port, oh sea, how majestic and inviolable you are!

    [Note 1] Refers to the warships of American and Japanese imperialism.
    [Note 2] When I was in Qingdao, every summer, American warships came to Qingdao to escape the heat. The American sailors were drunk and whipped people with leather whips. At that time, I wrote an article "The Civilized Whip" and published it in "Eastern Magazine".

    海滨杂诗
    臧克家
    海从碧澄澄的天空，看到了你的颜色，从一阵阵清风，嗅到了你的气息，摸着潮润的衣角触到了你的体温，深夜醒来，耳边传来了你有力的呼吸。
    会合晚潮从海上来了，明月从天上来了，人从红楼上来了。
    归来火红太阳从海上升起。鱼船回来了，满舱银鳞跃眼的鱼，“爸爸———”，一个孩子在沙滩上跳跃，涛声把他的欢呼抢去。
    送宝大海天天送宝，沙滩上踏满了脚印，手里玩弄着贝壳，脸上带着笑容，在这里不分大人孩子，个个都是大自然的儿童。
    大海的使者清风，大海的使者——从海面上吹来，从高楼的红瓦棱里吹来，从海涛似的绿树间吹来。你替旅人拂去一身尘土，从他们心里把闷热拨开，青岛呵，对于远道而来的游客，你就是一个绿色的海。
    亲近天天早晨在沙滩上碰面，我们彼此并不相识；我们彼此并不相识，天天傍晚碰面在沙滩；大海使我们亲近起来，老朋友似地打着招呼。
    青岛的颜色我要用自己的皮肤，把青岛夏天的颜色带回去。我叫海涛给冲上去，我叫太阳给晒上去，我叫沙滩给烫上去。
    旧游地二十年后的一条身子，来到了二十年前的旧游地，登上当年的石头楼向远处放眼：那些军舰的铁链解除
  了〔注一〕，大海呵，你呼吸得多么自由舒坦！踏踏踏，再也没有了刺耳的木
  屐声，不见了那些“季候的恶鸟”—用“文明的皮鞭”抽打中国人
  的美国水兵〔注二〕，我们的海军战士在港口上一站，大海呵，你是多么威严不可侵犯！
    〔注一〕指美、日帝国主义军舰。
    〔注二〕我当年在青岛时，每届夏季，美国军舰开来青岛避暑，美国水兵喝得醉醺醺的，用皮鞭抽人，当时我曾写了一篇“文明的皮鞭”，发表在“东方杂志”上。
     1956年7月24日于青岛湛山路
