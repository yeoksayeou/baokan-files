Xinhua News Agency, London, August 22nd. Opinions clashed between the East and West in the final stages of the Suez Canal Conference.

At yesterday's meeting, the delegates discussed two opposing proposals, one from India and one from the United States, which were completely different in their approach. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and Ceylon spoke in support of the Indian proposal. Spain had its own proposal, which was very different from the U.S. proposal. Other representatives more or less favored the U.S. proposal.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Chowdhry, representing the three Baghdad Pact countries (Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey) and Ethiopia, proposed several minor amendments to Dulles' proposal, which were readily accepted by Dulles.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani, speaking against Dulles' proposal, said that it "seems as if this conference is openly suggesting that Egypt cede some of its sovereignty. Such an implication can only arouse public resentment in Egypt, and perhaps in other countries of the world—like my own—which would hinder a final solution." He said, "Indonesia supports India's proposal, which is more or less consistent with my first statement at the beginning of this conference. Although India's proposal clearly states that Egypt should consider establishing links with the international user interest groups without prejudice to Egypt's ownership and management rights, it does not explicitly mention any wording that could be interpreted as reducing Egypt's sovereignty."

He pointed out that many other relevant countries had not participated in the conference, especially the most important party, Egypt. Without Egypt's participation, this conference cannot seek a final solution. He said that the Indonesian delegation hopes that the conference will make any declaration or proposal as flexible as possible, and never forget the ultimate goal of resolving the Suez Canal dispute.

Ceylon representative Corea spoke against Dulles' proposal, saying that his main objection was that international management of the canal was incompatible with Egypt's sovereignty. He said that he had no objection to the Indian proposal because it was not so definitive. He did not intend to put forward any proposal of his own, but he expressed the hope that everyone would further consider the suggestions he made in his last speech.

Soviet representative Shepilov, in his speech, talked about the principles and methods for resolving the Suez Canal issue.

Shepilov called for a new international agreement on the Suez Canal to be concluded in accordance with the new situation and the spirit of the times.

He said that this international agreement could include—for example—the following main provisions:

One, the Suez Canal should always be kept free and open to the passage of merchant ships and naval vessels of all countries on the basis of equality regarding shipping fees and port charges, as well as all shipping conditions. The canal shall not be used for political purposes that favor or harm any country related to canal navigation.

Two, the sovereignty of the canal belongs to Egypt, and the canal is owned and managed by Egypt. Egypt should take all necessary measures to: A, ensure the complete freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal, and protect the canal and its facilities from any situation that violates the freedom of navigation; B, maintain the canal in appropriate navigable condition that meets navigational needs and conforms to modern technical standards; C, carry out engineering works needed to improve navigation conditions to increase the traffic capacity of the Suez Canal to meet the interests of world trade and the interests of Egypt; D, submit appropriate information on the management of the Suez Canal to the United Nations.

Three, all signatories to the agreement should guarantee that, under any circumstances, they will not take actions that may damage the inviolability of the Suez Canal or cause physical damage to the canal's facilities, offices, buildings, and factories.

According to the provisions of the 1888 Convention, the Suez Canal must never become a venue for hostile actions; hostile actions are not allowed, nor are any actions that obstruct the free navigation of the canal and the use of the canal's ports; the canal shall not be subjected to any blockade.

Four, in matters relating to ensuring the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal, there should be definite international cooperation in a manner consistent with the new situation and the spirit of the times, and consistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations.

This goal can be achieved by establishing an advisory committee on the Suez Canal composed of representatives from countries concerned with maintaining the free navigation of the canal. In our opinion, for example, this committee could have the following functions:

A, provide opinions to the Egyptian canal authorities on the implementation of free navigation and transit fees.

B, provide appropriate assistance to the Egyptian government in maintaining the canal in suitable navigable condition when necessary.

C, call the attention of the Egyptian government and any other party to the agreement to the measures deemed necessary by the committee.

D, maintain appropriate contact with the United Nations and international organizations related to international navigation to fulfill the provisions of the agreement.

E, in the event of disputes concerning the implementation of the agreement, take steps to resolve such disputes, and, if necessary, submit them to the United Nations.

Shepilov said that the composition of the advisory committee and the procedures for its establishment could be determined by agreement. Any other plan aimed at organizing international cooperation that will provide guarantees for the free navigation of the Suez Canal while not infringing on Egypt's sovereign rights can also be discussed.

When commenting on the U.S. and Indian proposals, Shepilov said: "The U.S. draft is based on the following principles: depriving Egypt of its sovereignty, establishing a colonial system in Egypt under the guise of a concession through foreign management of the Suez Canal (which, according to the draft, will constitute a 'state within a state')."

He said: "The Indian draft is based on the following principles: strict respect for Egyptian sovereignty, recognition of Egypt's indisputable ownership of the Suez Canal, and management of the canal by Egypt, with appropriate links established between international interest groups using the canal and the Egyptian Suez Canal Company."

He said: "The Soviet delegation believes that the Indian government's proposal is in line with the interests of our work. Therefore, the Soviet delegation will not put forward any draft of its own, but believes that it can support the Indian proposal."

Shepilov continued, because different drafts, proposals, and opinions have been put forward, and amendments, comments, and supplements are being put forward one after another, therefore, the Soviet delegation suggests establishing a preparatory committee composed of representatives from countries such as Egypt, India, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to study the different proposals in order to compare various views and try to formulate universally acceptable principles for resolving the Suez issue.

This committee can also draft a new convention or agreement that supplements the 1888 Constantinople Convention. After completing this work, the committee can convene a qualified meeting in the near future, attended by all signatories to the 1888 Convention and all countries using the canal, to adopt the new convention or supplementary agreement to the 1888 Convention, and to decide on all other possible issues related to guaranteeing the free navigation of the Suez Canal.

He pointed out that organizing such a committee would not put Egypt in an unequal position and would enable it to participate effectively and on an equal footing in such an institution.

The Indonesian representative also put forward a similar opinion today suggesting organizing such a committee.

The Spanish representative suggested amending important provisions of the U.S. plan. He believes that the committee responsible for managing, maintaining, and developing the canal should be an Egyptian committee, not the Suez Canal Committee proposed by the United States, but the countries using the canal should have appropriate representation.

This amendment blatantly touched the essence of Dulles' proposal and was therefore immediately rejected by Dulles.

Dulles was engaged in intense activity until the start of the meeting, and only after this did many representatives speak in favor of Dulles' plan, and when they did so, they reaffirmed their attitude that there was no question of forcing Egypt to submit, and they also called for further discussions, especially with Egypt.

### 在21日伦敦会议上  苏联印度尼西亚等国支持印度建议  谢皮洛夫再次建议缔结新的国际协定

    在21日伦敦会议上
    苏联印度尼西亚等国支持印度建议
    谢皮洛夫再次建议缔结新的国际协定
    新华社伦敦22日电　在苏彝士运河会议的结束阶段，东西方之间的意见发生了冲突。
    在昨天的会议上，供代表们讨论的是印度和美国提出的两个方针完全不同的对立的方案。苏联、印度尼西亚和锡兰代表发言支持印度的方案。西班牙有它自己的方案，这个方案同美国的方案有很大不同。其他代表或多或少赞成美国的方案。
    巴基斯坦外长乔德里代表巴格达条约三国（巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其）以及埃塞俄比亚对杜勒斯的方案提出了若干小的修正，为杜勒斯所欣然接受。
    印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼在发言反对杜勒斯的方案的时候说，这个方案就“好像这次会议是在公开建议埃及分出它的某些主权似的。这样的含意，只能在埃及、也许还在世界的其他国家——像在我本国——引起公众的反感，这会妨碍取得最后的解决。”他说，“印度尼西亚支持印度的方案，这个方案多少是同我在这次会议开始时的第一次发言一致的。印度的方案虽然明确表示埃及应该考虑同国际使用者利益集团建立不损害埃及的所有权和经营权的联系，然而并没有公开提到任何可以被解释为减少埃及主权的字句。”
    他指出，还有其他许多有关的国家并没有参加会议，特别是最重要的当事国埃及。没有埃及参加，这个会议不能求得最后的解决。他说，印度尼西亚代表团希望会议使任何宣言或者建议尽可能地有伸缩性，而决不要忘记解决苏彝士运河争端这个最终目的。
    锡兰代表科里亚发言反对杜勒斯方案，他说，他的主要反对意见是，国际管理运河同埃及的主权是不相容的。他说，他对印度的方案没有反对意见，因为它没有把话说得那么死。他不打算再提出他自己的任何方案，但是他表示希望大家进一步考虑他在上次发言中提出的建议。
    苏联代表谢皮洛夫在发言中谈到了关于解决苏彝士运河问题的原则和方法。
    谢皮洛夫要求根据新的情况和时代的精神缔结关于苏彝士运河的新的国际协定。
    他说，这个国际协定可能包括——举例说——下列主要条款：
    一、苏彝士运河应当始终在关于航运费和港口费以及一切航运条件平等的基础上对一切国家的商船和海军舰只的通行保持自由开放。这条运河不得用于有利于或是有损于同运河航行有关的任何国家的政治目的。
    二、运河的主权属于埃及，运河归埃及所有和管理，埃及应当采取一切必要的措施以：甲、保证苏彝士运河通航的完全自由，并且保障运河及其设备防止违反通航自由的任何情况；乙、保养运河使它处于满足航行需要以及符合现代技术水平的适当航行条件之下；丙、进行为增加苏彝士运河通航能力所需要的改进航运条件的工程，以使运输量增加以符合世界贸易的利益和埃及的利益；丁、向联合国提出关于苏彝士运河管理情况的适当情报。
    三、所有协定签字国应当保证在任何情况下都不采取可能损害苏彝士运河的不可侵犯性或是使运河的设备、办公处、建筑物和工厂遭到物质破坏的行动。
    根据1888年公约的条款，苏彝士运河决不可以成为敌对行动的场合；不允许有敌对行动，也不允许有阻挠运河的自由通航和阻挠使用运河港口的任何行动；运河不得受到任何封锁。
    四、在有关保障苏彝士运河的航行自由的问题上，应该有符合于新的情况和时代的精神以及符合于联合国的原则和宗旨的方式的确定的国际合作。
    这个目的可以通过成立一个由关心维持运河的自由通航的国家的代表组成的关于苏彝士运河的咨询委员会而达到。根据我们的意见，例如，这个委员会可以具有如下的作用：
    甲、就实行自由航行和过境费问题向埃及的运河主管当局提出意见。
    乙、在必要时在保持运河的适于通行的条件方面向埃及政府提供适当的帮助。
    丙、请埃及政府和参加协定的任何其他方面注意关于委员会认为必要的措施。
    丁、为履行协定中的规定，着手同联合国及和国际航行有关的国际组织保持适当的接触。
    戊、在发生有关协定的履行的争端时，采取步骤解决这种争端，并且在必要时向联合国提出。
    谢皮洛夫说，咨询委员会的组成及其成立的程序可以通过协议决定。其他任何目的在于组织将对苏彝士运河的自由航行提供保证而同时不侵犯埃及的主权权利的国际合作的方案也可以加以讨论。
    谢皮洛夫在就美国和印度的建议发表意见的时候说：“美国草案是以下列原则为基础的：剥夺埃及主权，在租让的外衣下通过外国对苏彝士运河的管理（这种管理根据草案规定将构成“国家内部的国家”）在埃及建立殖民制度。”
    他说：“印度的草案是以下列原则为基础的：严格尊重埃及主权，承认埃及对苏彝士运河具有不可争辩的所有权以及由埃及管理运河而由使用运河的国际利益集团同埃及苏彝士运河公司建立适当联系。”
    他说：“苏联代表团认为：印度政府的方案符合我们工作的利益。因此，苏联代表团将不另外提出它自己的任何草案，而认为可以支持印度的方案。”
    谢皮洛夫接着说，因为不同的草案、建议和看法已经提出，而修正、意见和补充正在陆续提出，因此，苏联代表团建议成立由诸如埃及、印度、美国、英国、法国和苏联这样一些国家的代表组成的筹备委员会来研究不同的方案，以便比较各种看法，并且设法拟定普遍可以接受的解决苏彝士问题的原则。
    这个委员会还能够拟订一个补充1888年君士坦丁堡公约的新的公约或者协定的草案。在完成了这个工作以后，委员会可以在最近的将来召开由1888年公约的所有签字国以及所有使用运河的国家参加的有资格的会议，以便通过新的公约或者1888年公约的补充协定，以及决定与保证苏彝士运河的自由航行有关的一切其他可能的问题。
    他指出，组织这样的委员会将不会使埃及处于不平等的地位，并且会使它有可能有成效地以及在平等的地位上参加这种机构。
    印度尼西亚代表今天也提出建议组织这种委员会的类似的意见。
    西班牙代表建议修改美国方案的重要的条款。他认为：负责管理、保养和发展运河的应该是埃及的委员会而不是美国建议的苏彝士运河委员会，但是使用运河的各国应当有适当的代表权。
    这种修改公然触及杜勒斯的建议的实质，因此立即遭到杜勒斯的拒绝。
    杜勒斯一直到会议开始时还在进行紧张的活动，只是在这之后，许多代表才发言表示赞成杜勒斯的计划，而且当他们这样做的时候，他们重申他们的态度说，根本谈不到硬要埃及屈从的问题，他们还要求举行进一步的讨论，特别是和埃及一道进行讨论。
