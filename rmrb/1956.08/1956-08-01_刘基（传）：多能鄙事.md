"Duoneng Bishi" (Polymath's Trivial Pursuits) is a widely circulated folk book for daily use. It covers a wide range of topics, from diet, clothing, utensils, and various medicines to agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, and even yin-yang, divination, and other categories. It contains the scientific knowledge necessary for people's daily lives, as well as techniques for seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. The book is divided into four volumes: spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each further divided into three sub-volumes, totaling twelve volumes. The earliest extant edition is the one published in the nineteenth year of Jiajing (1540 AD) by Cheng Fa, the Confucian instructor of Qing Tian County. I have also seen a slightly later edition (Wanli edition) with Cheng Fa's preface. The author of this book is said to be Liu Ji. The name "Liu Bowen" is known to everyone in folk tales. His extensive knowledge, polymath skills, predictive abilities, and prophetic talents are also well known. One of the widely circulated books of prophecy, the "Shaobing Song" (Sesame Cake Song), is rumored to be his work. From the eighth volume onwards, a full five volumes describe "Da Xiao Liu Ren Ke" (Major and Minor Six Ren Lessons), "Yingzao Jixiong" (Construction Auspices), "Yingsheng Zayong" (Livelihood Miscellaneous Uses), "Shangguan Chuxing" (Official Travel), "Ma Yi Dao Yan" (Ma Yi's Sayings), "Za Zhan Fa" (Miscellaneous Divination Methods), etc. It is not surprising that it is attributed to him. However, the first to seventh volumes contain mostly practical knowledge, such as "Zao Jiu Fa" (Wine Making Method), "Zao Cu Fa" (Vinegar Making Method), "Tang Mi Guo Fa" (Sugar Honey Fruit Method), "Xi Lian Fa" (Washing and Refining Method), "Ran Se Fa" (Dyeing Method), "Li Rong Fang" (Grooming Recipes), "Zhong Shui Guo Fa" (Fruit Planting Method), "Zhong Yao Wu Fa" (Medicinal Plant Planting Method), "Yang Zhi Liu Chu Fa" (Raising and Treating Livestock Method), etc., which are similar to those described in "Qi Min Yao Shu" (Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People), "Yin Shan Zheng Yao" (Proper and Essential Diet), and "Nong Shu" (Book of Agriculture). Sometimes, they are even more detailed, supplementing what is lacking. It is possible that some "experienced" prescriptions are very useful and effective. For example, the blackening beard recipe and hair loss treatment in "Li Rong Fang," I wonder if anyone has tried them. Also, regarding the "Washing and Pasting Tieli Cloth Method," it says:

	"Grind pine nut kernels into a fine paste and use it for pasting; it will not be brittle."
	Another method: "Add a small amount of good tea powder to the paste, or brew strong tea with a drop of sesame oil and use it for pasting; it is also good. (Volume Four, Clothing Washing and Refining Method)" "Tieli cloth" was very popular in the Ming Dynasty, but it seems to be rarely seen today (thinner, finer, and more brittle than summer cloth produced in Liuyang, Hunan). Such small experiences are the result of actual multiple trials before being promoted. However, some experiences are quite bizarre, belonging to the category of folk superstitions and taboos, which were inevitable in the society of more than five hundred years ago. However, we must be especially careful in promoting those "experienced prescriptions," etc. Without the results of definite experiments, we should not rashly adopt them. I have an idea: the many planting methods, food and fruit preservation methods, wine and sauce brewing methods, grooming methods, livestock raising and treatment methods, and economic prescriptions passed down from ancient times should be tested separately by relevant departments, such as agricultural research institutes, food industry departments, medical and health departments, etc., in an organized and systematic manner. If they are good, they should be promoted. If they are harmful, they should be criticized and refuted, and we cannot allow their "erroneous seeds to spread." In short, while preserving and promoting excellent ancient traditions and experiences, we must also be responsible for the health and production safety of the people. This statement is not only specifically for the book "Duoneng Bishi," but also applies to many similar books I will talk about below. Otherwise, it will inevitably become a random introduction of some erroneous experiences and methods.

    刘基（传）：多能鄙事
    西谛
    “多能鄙事”是一部流传得相当广的民间日用书，从饮食、服饰、器用、百药、农圃、牧养，一直到阴阳、占卜等类，凡人民日常所必需的科学常识，以及吉凶趋避之术均具于书中。全书分春、夏、秋、冬四卷，每卷又分三卷，共十二卷。今所见最早的刊本是明嘉靖十九年（公元1540年）青田县儒学教谕程法所刊的，又曾见一部稍后的本子（万历刊），亦有程法的序。这书的作者相传是刘基。“刘伯温”这个名字，在民间是人人知道的，他的知识广博，多能鄙事，未占先知，料事如神，也是人人都晓的。流传很广的预言书之一：“烧饼歌”，就相传是他作的。这部书从第八卷起，足足有五卷，述的都是：“大小六壬课”，“营造吉凶”，“营生杂用”、“上官出行”、“麻衣道言”、“杂占法”等，依托于他的所作，是不足怪的。惟第一至第七卷则多实用的知识，像“造酒法”、“造醋法”、“糖蜜果法”、“洗练法”、“染色法”、“理容方”、“种水果法”、“种药物法”、“养治六畜法”等，大类“齐民要术”、“饮膳正要”、“农书”所述的，有时且加详，补其所未备。可能有些“经验”良方，是很有用、有效的。像“理容方”里的乌须方，治落发方等，不知有人试过没有。又像“洗糨铁骊布法”云：
    “松子肉研细糨之，不脆”。
    又法：“用好茶末少许入糊糨之或煎浓茶入香油一滴糨，亦佳。（卷之四服饰洗练法）“铁骊布”，在明代很风行，今日似已不大见到（比湖南浏阳出产的夏布更薄、更细、更脆硬）。像这样的小小经验，都是出于实际的多次试用的结果，然后才加以推广的。但有些经验却颇为怪诞，是属于民间的迷信、禁忌的一流，则是五百多年以前的社会里所不免会产生的。不过，我们对于推广那些“经验良方”等等，却要特别加以小心。非得有确实的试验的结果，不宜冒失地便加以采用。我有一个想法：对于古代流传的许多种植法，食物、水果保存法，酒酱酿造法，理容法，养治六畜法，以及经济良方等等，应该分别由有关部门，像农业研究所，食品工业部门，医药卫生部门等等，加以有组织、有系统的试验。是好的，就要发扬之。是有害的，就要加以批判、驳斥，不能听任其“谬种流传”。总之，在保存和发扬古代优良的传统和经验的同时，还要对人民的健康和生产安全负责。这一段话，不仅是专指“多能鄙事”这部书说的，也适用于一切我底下所谈到的好些类似的书。不然的话，不免要成为胡乱介绍若干谬诞的经验和方法了。
