    When I was a child, grazing in the woods, I heard an old man tell a story. It's probably a story that everyone is familiar with:
    The Dragon King had been spreading clouds and rain for three days and three nights; because the sky was high and the clouds were thick, the Dragon King didn't know how much rain had fallen, so he specially sent the Heng and Ha Generals to inspect the lower world.
    The Heng and Ha Generals, carrying rain-stopping staffs, rode the clouds and mist down to observe. Suddenly, with a "bang," they saw sparks flying from the mountain peak, followed by a wisp of green smoke.
    The Heng and Ha Generals returned to heaven and reported: "Because of the prolonged drought, the ground is as hard as iron, and the fields are smoking, bending all the rain-stopping staffs!" The Dragon King heard this and thought, "This is terrible!" He hurriedly ordered: "Let it rain! Torrential rain for a hundred days, day and night without stopping!"
    A hundred days passed, and the Dragon King rolled up the clouds and opened his eyes to look: the world was a vast expanse of water, with water everywhere, and villages and crops were all submerged. What was going on? After a detailed investigation, it became clear—it turned out that the Heng and Ha Generals' rain-stopping staffs had hit the Taihang Mountains.
    Unexpectedly, even now, we can see people doing investigative work like the Heng and Ha Generals in our world.
    This spring, the Finance Committee of the Baoding Special District in Hebei Province, in order to make commercial work adapt to the needs of agricultural development, dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to understand the new changes in the countryside. The comrades who went to Gaoyang reported: "The farmers in a certain agricultural cooperative have unprecedentedly high enthusiasm for production. According to the cooperative's plan, each work-day this year will be allocated more than four yuan, three times higher than last year. The farmers have many demands, they want electric lights, machines for irrigation, new houses... This spring they need fifteen boiler-camel machines, ten small steel grinders, twenty-five mules and horses, as well as a large number of double-share plows, chaff cutters, corn threshers, gas lamps, mimeographs, cement, etc., a total of more than forty kinds. Not counting what the members need individually, the total value of collective purchases by the cooperative will reach more than 50,000 yuan. We suggested that the Gaoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative sign a contract with the agricultural cooperative."
    The leading comrade listening to the report smiled and nodded, obviously feeling happy about the "meteoric" rise in the farmers' lives.
    What was the result? The Gaoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with this agricultural cooperative for the purchase and sale of more than 50,000 yuan worth of goods in one season, but the actual transaction volume was only more than 500 yuan—the actual situation differed from the investigation team's materials by a hundred times!
    What's the reason? Later, when checking the implementation of the contract, the director of the cooperative gave the correct answer. Asked, "Why don't you implement the contract, don't you need these things?" The director of the cooperative said: "We need a lot of things! It's just that we don't have the money. Are you giving them away for free? Not to mention 50,000 yuan, even 5 million yuan worth of things would not be enough for us."
    This spring, the industrial departments of Hebei Province released good news: workers in a certain factory invented a new irrigation tool—a well-less waterwheel.
    Being able to irrigate without digging a well was an unexpectedly good piece of news. So, an experiment was conducted by a small river in the southern part of Baoding City. The conclusion of the experiment: the water output is very smooth. Pulling it saves not only the money for digging wells, but also makes it convenient to move. Therefore, the industrial departments of Hebei Province decided: "Mass production, universal promotion." What was the result? "Mass production, massive stockpiling." According to statistics from the Baoding Special District: more than 95% of the areas cannot use the well-less waterwheel. More than 3,000 units were sold to farmers, but less than 400 units were used. The farmers demanded a full refund.
    Why was it usable in the early experiments, but not usable later? It turned out that this was the reason: the experiment was conducted by a small river, on sandy soil, where the groundwater was less than a丈 (zhàng, approx. 3.3 meters) below the surface, and the experiment time was very short. The soil in the Baoding area is mostly black soil. When the pipe is inserted, the water absorption holes of the pipe are clogged with mud and sand, and no water can be pumped out. In some sandy soil areas, the water is two or three 丈 below the surface, and the pipe is filled with mud and sand. Although pulling it was twice as heavy as other waterwheels on the first day, it was still barely usable. By the second day, the mud and sand filled the pipe. Not only could it not pump water, but if you didn't quickly pull the pipe out, you would have to mobilize the members to dig it out.
    Doing investigative work does not mean that there is no subjectivism. It also depends on whether you use the investigation methods and attitudes of the Heng and Ha Generals, or the real scientific investigation methods and meticulous and honest attitude. As for those who make major decisions based on the investigation materials, it is also worthwhile to take the Dragon King as a warning.

    哼哈二将和龙王
    安永华
    我小时候，在树林里放牧的日子，听一位老人说过这么一段故事。这可能是大家都很熟悉的一个故事：
    龙王铺云降雨已有三天三夜；因为天高云厚，龙王不知道雨已经下了多少，于是特派哼哈二位天将到下界视察。
    哼哈二将身带止雨棒，腾云驾雾，下来观看。忽然“崩登”一声，只见那山尖上，火光四射，一溜青烟。
    哼哈二将归天报告：“因天久旱，地硬如铁，田园冒烟，把止雨棒全给碰弯！”龙王听过，心想：“这还了得！”急忙下令：“下吧！倾盆大雨一百天，昼夜不停！”
    百天已过，龙王将云卷起，睁眼一看：天下一片汪洋，遍地是水，村庄、庄稼全被淹没。怎么回事呢？详细查究了一番之后，才弄清楚——原来是哼哈二将的止雨棒，碰到太行山峰上了。
    想不到到了现在，在我们的人世间也可以见到像哼哈二将这样做调查工作的人。
    今春河北保定专区财委为了使商业工作适应农业发展的需要，抽派了大批干部，深入农业社了解农村新的变化。到高阳去的同志们回来报告：“某某农业社农民生产情绪空前提高，按社里的规划：今年每个劳动日要分到四元多，比去年提高三倍。农民要求很多，要电灯，要机器浇地，要盖新房子……。今春需要锅驼机十五个、小钢磨十个、骡马二十五头，还要大量的双铧犁、铡草机、玉米脱粒机、气灯、油印机、水泥等等共四十多种。社员个人需要的不算，只是合作社集体购买的总值即达五万多元。我们建议高阳县供销社同农业社订立了合同。”
    听报告的领导同志微笑着点了点头，显然是对农民生活这样“一日万丈”的上升感到幸福。
    结果怎样？高阳县供销社同这个农业社订了一季购销五万多元货物的合同，实现的交易额只不过五百多元——实际情况同调查研究组的调查材料差了一百倍！
    原因何在？后来检查合同执行情况的时候，社主任给作了正确的答案。问：“怎么你们不执行合同，这些东西不需要吗？”社主任说：“我们需要的东西还多着呢！就是没钱。你们白给吗？别说五万元，就是五百万元的东西，我们也不够用。”
    今春河北省工业部门传出了一个好消息：某厂工人发明了一种新灌溉工具——无井水车。
    不用打井就可以浇地，这是一个喜出望外的好消息。于是，在保定市南一条小河边进行了试验。试验的结论：出水很利。拉着它，不光省打井钱，移动还方便。于是，河北省的工业部门决定：“大量生产，普遍推广。”结果呢？“大量生产，大量积压。”据保定专区统计：无井水车有95％以上的地区不能用。销给农民三千多架，使用起来的不到四百架。农民要求全部退货。
    怎么早先试验能用，后来又不能用了呢？原来是这么一回事：试验的时候是在小河边，是沙土地，地下水离地面不到一丈，试验的时间很短。保定地区土壤多是黑土地，把管子伸进去，管子的吸水孔被泥沙糊住，打不出水来；部分沙土底的地区，水离地面两三丈，管子伸下去泥沙里灌。第一天虽说拉着比别的水车重一倍，但还勉强可以用。到第二天，泥沙把管子灌满，不但不能出水，如果不赶快把管子拔出来，就得发动社员刨它了。
    做了调查工作，不等于说就没有了主观主义。还要看是用哼哈二将的调查方法和态度呢，还是用的真正科学的调查方法和细密老实的态度。至于根据调查材料决定重大行动的人，也很值得以龙王为戒。
