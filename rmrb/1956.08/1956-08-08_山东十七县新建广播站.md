Shandong Broadcasting Station:

    Since the first half of this year, Shandong Province has built radio stations in seventeen counties, including Laixi, Weixian, Huantai, and Guangrao, which have now started broadcasting. Together with the twenty county and small-to-medium city radio stations built last year, the province now has thirty-seven radio stations. In addition, radio stations in forty-seven cities and counties, including Jinan, Qingdao, Yucheng, and Gaomi, are under construction and are expected to be completed by the end of the year. At that time, the number of loudspeakers in the province's radio stations will increase from the current 3,600 to around 25,000.
