Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Yugoslavia's total industrial output for the first half of this year increased by 5% compared to the same period last year. Industrial production grew the fastest in June, increasing by 9% compared to May.

The paper industry experienced the fastest growth in production during the first half of this year, increasing by 35%. The chemical industry followed, with a growth of 17%. The output of electrical equipment and electricity increased by 13% and 11% respectively. Steel and coal increased by 9%.

Yugoslav economic circles point out that the increased amount of industrial production in June is not enough to compensate for the losses caused by the slow production growth in the first few months of this year. The reasons for this slow production growth are mainly poor weather conditions, untimely transportation, and a lack of raw materials. However, the gradual increase in industrial production since March indicates that the slow production growth at the beginning of this year was temporary. It is expected that the plan to increase industrial production by 10% this year can be achieved after improving the supply of electricity and materials to industry.

    南斯拉夫工业总产量比去年增多
    造纸工业增长35％钢铁和煤增长9％
    新华社31日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，今年上半年南斯拉夫工业总产量比去年同期增长了5％。六月份工业生产增长得最快，比五月份增长了9％。
    今年上半年生产增长得最快的是造纸工业，一共增加了35％，其次是化学工业，增长了17％。电工器材和电力的产量分别增长了13％，和11％，钢铁和煤增长了9％。
    南斯拉夫经济界人士指出，六月份工业生产的增长数量还不足以弥补今年头几月生产增长缓慢所造成的损失。造成这种生产增长缓慢的原因，主要是气候条件不好、运输不及时和缺乏原料。可是，从三月以后工业生产逐步上升的情况说明：今年年初生产增长缓慢的情况是暂时的。预料，在改善了对工业的电力和材料的供应以后，今年增加工业生产10％的计划是能够实现的。
