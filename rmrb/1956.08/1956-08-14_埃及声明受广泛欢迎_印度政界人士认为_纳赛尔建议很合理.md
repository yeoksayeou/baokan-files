Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 13th - The "Hindustan Times" reported today that Indian government officials and politicians alike welcome Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's proposal to convene an international conference to guarantee freedom of navigation. These individuals believe it is a very reasonable and constructive proposal for resolving the Suez Canal issue.
    Indian government officials have been anxiously awaiting Nasser's speech. They point out that Nasser demonstrated "high political maturity and judgment" in proposing a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal issue. They said that this proposal is in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Charter of the United Nations.
    Political figures in New Delhi particularly value Nasser's point that the proposed conference should consider concluding an agreement on the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. These individuals say that if this proposal is accepted by the governments of all relevant countries, it will greatly help to achieve a solution to this crisis that satisfies all parties involved. These individuals believe that Egypt could not have put forward a better proposal that is in line with its rights as an autonomous country, because it has already agreed to re-examine the Convention of Constantinople in order to "reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal." These individuals say that it should be emphasized in Nasser's proposal that guarantees of freedom of navigation through the canal can be maintained through international agreements registered with the United Nations.

    纳赛尔建议很合理
    新华社新德里13日电　“印度斯坦时报”今天报道，印度的政府人士和政界人士都欢迎埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔所提出的关于召开国际会议以保障航行自由的建议。这些人士认为这是对解决苏彝士运河问题具有很大建设性的十分合理的建议。
    印度政府人士一直在焦急地等待着纳赛尔的演说。他们指出，纳赛尔在提出和平解决苏彝士运河问题的建议上，表现了“高度的政治成熟和判断力”。他们说，这个建议是符合万隆会议的精神和联合国宪章的。
    新德里政界人士特别重视纳赛尔的这一点意见，即：拟议中的这个会议应该考虑就苏彝士运河航行自由问题缔结协定。这些人士说，如果这个建议被一切有关国家的政府所接受，那末就会大大有助于使这个危机得到使有关各方面都感到满意的解决。这些人士认为，埃及不可能提出比这个建议更好的、符合它作为自主国的权利的建议来了，因为它已经同意为了“重申并且保证苏彝士运河的航行自由”而重新研究君士坦丁堡公约。这些人士说，应当重视纳赛尔的建议中的这一点，那就是：运河通航自由的保证可以通过在联合国登记的国际协定来维持。
