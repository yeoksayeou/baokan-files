Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th: Farmers in disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas of Henan Province are currently taking measures to increase the yields of autumn crops, striving to reduce losses.
	Farmers in riverine areas of Xinyang, Shangqiu, Xuchang, Anyang, and Xinxiang prefectures are, under the slogan of "Planting every plot possible, harvesting every basket possible," working day and night to drain accumulated water and carry out replanting and supplementary planting. Xinyang, Xinxiang, Anyang, and Shangqiu prefectures have already rushed to plant 2,948,000 mu. These areas have also planted late autumn crops on many vacant lands.
	The vast number of farmers in non-disaster areas are also taking various measures to strive for increased autumn crop production to make up for the losses in disaster areas. Many counties in Kaifeng, Nanyang, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Luoyang prefectures have formulated new measures to increase production. Luoyang Prefecture held short-term training classes at the prefectural and county levels to strengthen the management of autumn crops. Jixian County convened a meeting on the 18th with the directors and technical section chiefs of forty-six agricultural cooperatives, formulating methods for late-stage management of autumn fields, requiring non-disaster areas to increase grain and cotton production by another 10%. Fengqiu County is applying topdressing fertilizer, dredging ditches, earthing up, and lifting vines in sweet potato fields, planning to increase production by another 500 jin per mu; corn is undergoing artificial pollination and detasseling hybridization, increasing production by 20 jin per mu; cotton is undergoing corolla removal, old leaf removal, empty branch pruning, weeding, and pest control, increasing production by 5 jin per mu; and general grain crops are increasing production by 5 to 10 jin per mu.
	Currently, all parts of the province are weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer, and replanting to strive for increased production. Many agricultural cooperative members in non-disaster areas say, "After weeding the fields, we will harvest more grain this year to support the disaster areas in overcoming the disaster."

    河南各地农民采取措施
    增加秋季作物产量减少受灾损失
    新华社郑州28日电　河南省灾区和非灾区的农民目前正在采取增加秋季作物产量的措施，力争减少损失。
    信阳、商丘、许昌和安阳、新乡等专区沿河地带的农民，在“多种一块是一块，多收一篮是一篮”的口号下，日日夜夜排除积水，进行重种和补种。信阳、新乡、安阳、商丘等专区已经抢种二百九十四万八千亩。这些地区还在许多空白地上种上了晚秋作物。
    广大非灾区的农民也采取各种办法争取秋季作物增产，弥补灾区损失。开封，南阳、安阳、新乡、洛阳等专区的许多县内都已制定了新的增产措施。洛阳专区专、县都举办了加强秋季作物管理的短期训练班。汲县在十八日召开了四十六个社的社主任、技术股长会议，制出秋田后期管理办法，要求非灾区粮棉再增产一成。封丘县正在红薯地里施追肥、冲沟、培土、提蔓，计划每亩再增产五百斤，玉米实行人工授粉、去雄杂交，每亩增产二十斤，棉花实行去花冠、打老叶、剪空枝、拔草、治虫，每亩增产五斤，一般粮食作物每亩增产五至十斤。
    现在，全省各地都在除草、追肥和补种，争取增产。许多非灾区农业社社员说，锄完地里草，今年多打粮，支援灾区战胜灾荒。
