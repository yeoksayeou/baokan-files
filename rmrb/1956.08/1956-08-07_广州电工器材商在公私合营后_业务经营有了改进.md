Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 5th. The Guangzhou electrical equipment commercial industry has seen significant improvements in its business operations in the six months since the implementation of full public-private partnership in January this year.

In the first half of this year, the industry's turnover increased two to three times compared to the same period last year, and it has been rising month by month, reversing the trend of losses that had been common in the first half of previous years. For example, among the 38 fixed-interest households, many used to experience losses every month in the first half of the year, but in the past six months, except for three households that did not have a surplus in one month, all other households have had a surplus every month. The 38 households had a total surplus of over 140,000 yuan.

The Guangzhou electrical equipment commercial industry originally had 335 households. After the full public-private partnership, except for the water and electricity installation households that were transferred to the handicraft industry, the remaining households were merged and reorganized into 83 households, of which 38 households implemented fixed interest, and 45 households became sales agencies for state-owned companies. The original strengths and excellent traditions of each household's operation have been maintained. For example, a store that specializes in outdoor ceramic iron material accessories has maintained its original product categories after economic reorganization. In May of this year, when there was a shortage of ceramic iron material accessories in the city, this store actively sought ways to organize supply sources, meeting the needs of more than a dozen important industrial and mining units.

In the past six months, the state-owned electrical equipment company has taken various measures to help 29 households in the electrical equipment commercial industry overcome the difficulties of capital shortage and lack of supply, and has also actively led the stores to carry out the advanced worker movement. By mid-July, the industry had produced five advanced units and twenty-three advanced workers.

    广州电工器材商在公私合营后
    业务经营有了改进
    新华社广州5日电　广州市电工器材商业行业在今年一月份实行全行业公私合营以后的六个月来，业务经营上有了很大的改善。
    今年上半年，全行业的营业额，比去年同期增加二倍到三倍，而且是逐月上升的，扭转了历年来上半年总是亏本的状况。如三十八户定息户中，去年上半年每月都有很多户亏本，而今年六个月来，除其中三户有一个月没有盈余外，其余各户月月都有盈余。三十八户共盈余十四万多元。
    广州市电工器材商业行业原有三百三十五户，除了水电安装各户划入手工业以外，其余的在全行业公私合营以后，合并改组为八十三户，其中有三十八户实行了定息，四十五户为国营公司的代销店。各户经营上原有的特长和优良传统得到保持。如有一家经营室外陶瓷铁料配件的商店，在经济改组以后，仍保持了原来经营的商品种类。今年五月间，全市陶瓷铁料配件缺货，这个店便积极设法组织货源，满足了十多个重要工矿单位的需要。
    六个月来，国营电工器材公司采取了多种办法，帮助电工器材商业行业中的二十九户克服资金短少、货源缺乏的困难，还积极领导各店开展先进工作者运动。到七月中旬，全行业已涌现出先进单位五个和先进工作者二十三人。
