How to Better Cultivate Senior Construction Talents
(Discussion at the Symposium of University Presidents and Academic Affairs Directors)
At the soon-to-be-concluded summer symposium of university presidents and academic affairs directors, nearly eighty attendees engaged in heated discussions on how to better cultivate senior construction talents with independent working abilities for the country, and how to raise the quality of higher education to a new level.

In their discussions, they believed that there was no doubt that the teaching reforms carried out in the past few years by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union had achieved great success. Higher education had systematically and proportionally cultivated a large number of senior specialized talents according to the needs of the state. The training objectives of various specialties were clear, and the connection between theory and practice was implemented in teaching. These characteristics were incomparable to the old education system. Judging from the quality of graduates, generally speaking, there has also been varying degrees of improvement compared with graduates of universities in old China. However, the university presidents and academic affairs directors present also believed that there are still many shortcomings in the current higher education work, some of which are serious. For example, the cultivation of students' independent working ability is still very poor, which is one of the main problems. Currently, college students' ability to think independently is insufficient, and many graduates cannot quickly and independently undertake the work that they are trained for.

What factors affect the cultivation of students' independent working ability? From the speeches of the university presidents and academic affairs directors present, it can be seen that this has many reasons.

Many people believe that the most fundamental reason is the contradiction between the quantity and quality of cadres trained in the current higher education system. In the past few years, higher education has trained more than 275,000 senior specialized talents for the country, which is more than the total number of university graduates in the thirty-six years before liberation. In the next twelve years, the scale of talents trained by higher education for the country will be even greater. According to preliminary estimates, the number of industrial construction talents that national construction requires higher education to train in these twelve years will greatly exceed the number of engineering graduates trained by the United States in the twenty-six years before 1954, and is close to the number of industrial construction talents trained by the Soviet Union in the corresponding twenty-six years. Due to the rapid development of higher education, in order to meet the number of enrollments, the level of freshmen admitted by universities varies, which is very different from the situation before liberation when universities admitted one out of twenty applicants, which has added many difficulties to teaching work. The task of cultivation has increased rapidly, but the strength of teachers cannot keep up, and the quality of teaching has also been affected to a certain extent.

Regarding this contradiction, some people at the symposium suggested that whether national construction needs so many senior specialized talents is worthy of in-depth study by the Ministry of Higher Education and relevant departments, opposing any blindness and one-sidedness. Another part of the people at the symposium believed that although this is a fundamental contradiction, as long as some shortcomings manifested in the current higher education work are quickly improved, and the development tasks appropriately take into account needs and possibilities, and are not too rapid, there are still conditions to ensure a certain quality and meet the needs of national construction for cadres; believing that our generation of educators must and can undertake this unprecedentedly arduous task given by the country.

Starting from the proposition of having to meet the needs of national construction, the university presidents and academic affairs directors present discussed some of the main problems existing in teaching work that affect the cultivation of students' independent working ability.

Some attendees pointed out that when universities learned from the Soviet experience to carry out teaching reforms in 1952, they did not pay enough attention to the original historical heritage of Chinese higher education, and in the past few years, many measures were not sufficiently combined with the specific conditions of Chinese higher education at that time. Therefore, the primary step to improve teaching quality at present is to try to quickly eliminate the tendencies of dogmatism and formalism generated in learning from the Soviet experience to carry out teaching reforms, due to the lack of understanding of the spiritual essence of the Soviet experience, the lack of research on its development process, insufficient combination with China's specific reality, and poor application. The unified teaching plans and unified teaching syllabuses currently used by universities, which are based on the Soviet Union as a blueprint, are generally too voluminous or too heavy, the requirements are too high, the number of courses and class hours is too large, and students have very little time to freely allocate. Students do not have enough time to review and learn deeply and thoroughly, and even less time for free reading and research. This situation must be changed.

The symposium discussed how to deeply learn from the Soviet Union's experience in higher education construction by closely combining it with China's actual situation in the future. They believed that the so-called China's reality includes China's existing teaching experience and achievements; some believed that it should also take into account China's history, natural, economic and other conditions, China's industrial production level, as well as the specific conditions of teachers, students, and equipment. Combining these Chinese conditions and creatively learning and applying them, avoiding formalism, will have better results. For example, according to the characteristics that most Chinese university students live in dormitories, some people proposed that it is not necessary to rigidly stipulate the time for exercise classes, because students have sufficient conditions to ask teachers or senior students even if they have questions. There are many such questions.

The university presidents and academic affairs directors present believed that to cultivate senior construction talents with independent working abilities, it is necessary to correctly implement the educational policy of all-round development and teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, so that students' physical, political, and professional knowledge can all be developed to a certain extent according to their different circumstances; at the same time, they can give play to their personal strengths, personality, and hobbies. Some people also opposed equating teaching students in accordance with their aptitude with the educational policy of all-round development, because all-round development already has the meaning of teaching students in accordance with their aptitude. They worried that after emphasizing the cultivation of "geniuses," teachers would pay more attention to or only care about a few so-called "favorite" "top students," while not paying enough attention to general students. However, many people believed that at present, the main thing is to change the tendency of average development formed by incomplete and incorrect understanding in implementing the policy of all-round development. Some also suggested that a few outstanding students, with approval, may be allowed not to attend a certain course, so that they have more time to study other courses. However, most people believed that the current conditions are not yet available and can be considered as a direction.

Many people at the symposium proposed that it is necessary to change the past situation where the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education overemphasized unity, and to give schools a certain degree of flexibility in teaching plans, teaching syllabuses and relevant teaching regulations. Some proposed that the flexible right to implement the teaching plan should be given to the principal, the flexible right to use the teaching syllabus should be given to the teacher, and students should be allowed to freely allocate their extracurricular time. In this way, it is possible to adapt to the current unbalanced development of universities, and to gradually change the shortcomings of students' rigid and mechanical learning life. They believed that each university should better grasp the depth of the teaching syllabus flexibly according to its own conditions and characteristics, such as adapting to the level of students. Most believed that unified leadership should still be emphasized, and schools should seek flexibility under certain principles.

In order to cultivate students' independent working ability, some people at the symposium had different opinions on "learn a little less, learn a little better." They believed that China should learn more and learn better in order to catch up with the world's advanced level in twelve years. However, most people still believed that at present, on the premise of not affecting the training objectives, it should be learning a little less, learning a little better; the current teaching plans and teaching syllabuses should be appropriately streamlined to increase the time that students can control themselves.

Someone took the mechanical manufacturing major as an example, believing that in the teaching plan of this major, if the two courses of thermal processing technology and safety and fire prevention are removed, it will not affect the cultivation of professional knowledge at all, and students can increase the freely allocated time of four class hours per week. Some pointed out that the selection of courses should be determined according to the specific situation of each major. For example, the course of safety and fire prevention can not be listed as a separate course in the teaching plan for cultivating mechanical manufacturing specialized talents; however, it is quite important in the teaching plan for cultivating specialized talents in petroleum and mining area development. The symposium unanimously believed that exercise classes, classroom discussions, etc. in the teaching plan can be appropriately streamlined, while production internships, course design or course papers, graduation design or graduation thesis are important links in cultivating students' ability to connect theory with practice, think independently and work independently, and should be appropriately strengthened or strive for conditions to gradually strengthen.

The university presidents and academic affairs directors present emphasized that the country urgently needs talents to build socialism, and as long as the learning task is "heavy" but not "excessive," tension is reasonable. In order to ensure that students have a healthy physique to carry out intensive study, many people at the symposium suggested appropriately improving students' living and learning conditions.

### 如何更好地培养高级建设人材  （在高等学校校院长和教务长座谈会上的讨论）

    如何更好地培养高级建设人材
    （在高等学校校院长和教务长座谈会上的讨论）
    在行将结束的暑期高等学校校院长和教务长座谈会上，到会的近八十位校院长和教务长就如何为国家更好地培养具有独立工作能力的高级建设人才，使高等教育质量提高到新的水平这个问题，展开了热烈的讨论。
    他们在讨论中认为，不用怀疑，这几年来学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革是取得巨大成绩的，高等教育按国家需要有计划按比例地培养了大批高级专门人材，各种专业培养目标明确，并且在教学中贯彻了理论和实际的联系。这些特点不是旧教育制度所能相比的。从毕业生的质量来看，一般说来和旧中国的高等学校毕业生相比，也有不同程度的提高。但是，到会的校院长和教务长们同时认为，目前高等教育工作中还存在着很多缺点，有些还是严重的，例如对培养学生的独立工作能力方面还很差，就是主要问题之一。当前高等学校的在校学生独立思考能力不够，许多毕业生一时还不能迅速独立地担当起按照他们的专业训练可以担当的工作。
    是什么因素影响着学生独立工作能力的培养呢？从到会的校院长和教务长们的发言中，可以看出这有着多方面的原因。
    很多人认为，最根本的原因是目前高等教育培养干部的数量和质量上存在着矛盾。高等教育在过去几年内为国家培养了二十七万五千多名高级专门人才，比解放前三十六年的高等学校毕业生总数还要多。在今后十二年内，高等教育为国家培养的人才的规模将更为巨大，根据初步估计，这十二年内国家建设要求高等教育培养的工业建设人才，在数量上大大超过美国在1954年以前的二十六年内所培养的工科毕业生，而接近于苏联在相应的二十六年内所培养的工业建设人才。由于高等教育的迅速发展，高等学校为了满足招生数量，录取的新生程度是参差不齐的，这和解放以前高等学校招生从二十人中录取一人的情况有很大不同，使教学工作增加了不少困难。培养任务增加快，而师资的力量赶不上，教学质量也受到一定影响。
    对于这个矛盾，座谈会上一部分人提出，国家建设是否需要这么多高级专门人才值得高等教育部和有关部门作深入的研究，反对任何盲目性和片面性。座谈会上的另一部分人认为，这虽然是根本性质的矛盾，但是，只要目前高等学校工作中表现出来的若干缺点迅速改进，在发展任务上适当兼顾到需要与可能，不太猛，仍然有条件可以保证一定的质量，满足国家建设对干部的需要；认为我们一代的教育工作者必须、也有可能把国家给予的这个空前艰巨的任务担当起来。
    从必须满足国家建设需要的命题出发，到会的校院长和教务长们就教学工作中存在的影响培养学生独立工作能力的一些主要问题，作了探讨。
    有的到会者指出，高等学校在1952年学习苏联经验进行教学改革时，重视中国高等教育原有的历史遗产不够，几年来许多措施结合中国当时高等教育的具体条件也不够，所以当前提高教学质量的首要步骤，是设法迅速地消除在学习苏联经验进行教学改革中，由于对苏联经验的精神实质缺乏体会，对它的发展过程也缺乏研究，结合中国具体实际不够，运用也不好等原因所产生的教条主义和形式主义的偏向。目前高等学校所用的以苏联的为蓝本的统一教学计划和统一教学大纲，一般分量偏多或过重，要求偏高，课程门数和上课时数嫌多，学生自由支配的时间很少，学生没有充分的时间温习，学得深些，透些，更很少有自由阅读钻研的时间。这种情况必须改变。
    座谈会上讨论了今后应如何密切结合中国实际深入地学习苏联高等教育建设经验。他们认为，所谓中国的实际就是包括中国已有的教学经验和成绩；有的认为，还应该同时考虑到中国的历史、自然、经济等条件，中国的工业生产水平以及师资、学生、设备等具体情况。密切结合这些中国情况和条件，创造性地学习运用，避免形式主义，效果会更好些。譬如，根据中国高等学校学生多半住宿的特点，有人提出可以不必硬性规定习题课的时间，因为学生即使有疑问，也有询问教师或高年级学生的充分条件。这样的问题是很多的。
    到会的校院长和教务长认为，要培养具有独立工作能力的高级建设人才，必须正确地贯彻全面发展、因才施教的教育方针，使学生的身体、政治、专业知识随着各人的不同情况，都获得一定的发展；同时能够发挥个人的专长、个性和爱好。也有人反对把因才施教和全面发展的教育方针相提并论，因为全面发展已经有因才施教的含义。他们顾虑，强调培养“天才”以后，教师会多关心或只关心几个程度高的所谓“心爱”的“高材生”，而对一般学生注意不够。不过，许多人认为，目前主要地还是应该改变在贯彻全面发展方针上由于理解不全面不正确所形成的平均发展的偏向。有的还建议，少数优秀学生经过批准可以允许不上某门课程，这样，他们就有更多的时间去钻研别的课程。不过，大多数人认为目前的条件还不具备，可以作为一个方向来考虑。
    座谈会上很多人提出，一定要改变过去高等教育部领导上过分强调统一的情况，要给予学校在教学计划、教学大纲和有关教学的规章制度方面一定的灵活性。有的提出，应该把执行教学计划的灵活权交给校长，运用教学大纲的灵活权交给教师，课外时间允许学生自由支配。这样，才能适应目前高等学校发展不平衡的情况，才能逐步改变学生学习生活呆板机械的缺点。他们认为，各个高等学校应该更好地按照自己的条件和特点，如适应学生的程度，来灵活地掌握教学大纲的深度。多数认为，统一领导还是应该强调，学校应该是在一定的原则下讲求灵活性。
    为了培养学生独立工作的能力，座谈会上有人对于“学少一点，学好一点”有不同意见。他们认为，中国要在十二年内赶上世界先进水平，应该是多学一点，学好一点。但是，多数人还是认为，目前在不影响培养目标的前提下，应该是学少一点，学好一点；对目前的教学计划和教学大纲应该作适当的精简，以增加学生自己支配的时间。
    有人以机械制造专业为例，认为在这一专业的教学计划中，如果减去热加工工艺、保安防火两门课程，完全不致影响对专业知识的培养，而学生却可以增加每周四个学时的自由支配时间。有的指出，对课程的取舍应该根据各个专业的具体情况确定，譬如保安防火这门课程，在培养机械制造专门人才的教学计划中可以不单独列为一门课程；但是，对于培养石油、矿区开采等专门人才的教学计划中，却相当重要。座谈会上一致认为，教学计划中的习题课、课堂讨论等可以适当精简，而生产实习、课程设计或课程论文、毕业设计或毕业论文，却是培养学生理论联系实际、独立思考和独立工作能力的重要环节，应当适当加强或争取条件逐步加强。
    到会的校院长和教务长强调指出，国家迫切需要建设社会主义的人才，学习任务只要是“重”而不“过”，紧张是合情合理的。为了保证学生有健康的体质来进行紧张的学习，很多人在座谈会上建议适当改善学生的生活条件和学习条件。　　　　　（新华社）
