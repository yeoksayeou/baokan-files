    Motherly Love
    Zhao Hua
    This is what I saw and experienced in the hospital last winter.
    At that time, my seventh child was about to be born. My spouse and I decided, "If it's a girl, we'll keep her and raise her ourselves. If it's a boy, we'll give him to other comrades to raise." Because we already had five boys and only one girl.
    The day before the delivery, I told the nurse comrade about this decision and instructed her, "If it's a boy, please don't let me see him. Let my spouse arrange it." The nurse comrade sighed and said, "You can be considered to value daughters over sons." She then told a story about the opposite, "valuing sons over daughters":
    In the first half of last year, the hospital, in managing the discharge of seven or eight postpartum women at the same time, mistakenly wrapped a boy born to A and gave him to B, and wrapped a girl born to B and gave her to A. At that time, two plump and adorable infants, just seven days old, were sound asleep. Neither mother examined them closely and happily took them away.
    That afternoon, A discovered the mistake and took the girl back to the hospital, requesting to exchange her for the boy. The hospital immediately notified the three postpartum women who gave birth to girls at the same time, asking them to check who had mistakenly taken the child. On the third day, the replies from the three mothers all arrived, but only B's reply included this sentence: "I originally gave birth to a boy."
    The truth was revealed.
    The mistake had to be corrected, so the nurse comrades made a very interesting arrangement. They invited B to come to the hospital at 5:00 p.m. on the fourth day to talk and instructed her not to bring the child. When the time came, they wrapped the temporarily unclaimed girl in rags, made some disguises, making her look yellow, thin, and dirty, and then left her alone in a small room, letting her cry.
    B arrived. The nurses courteously described the accident to her and then took her to the small room to see the seemingly abandoned girl. At this time, the small life struggling in the rags was crying even more fiercely. B's expression immediately became uneasy, and tears filled her eyes. After a slight hesitation, she picked up the girl and began to breastfeed her, saying with both shame and anger, "Why did you mistreat my child like this? I wouldn't treat someone else's child like this..."
    After telling this story, the nurse comrade said to me, "I don't believe you don't want the boy you give birth to."
    The next day, my seventh child was born. I rested in bed for half a day, and suddenly the image of an infant wrapped in rags, hungry and dirty, popped into my head. I became restless and asked the nurse comrade to bring my child to see me.
    The nurse comrade laughed and said, "Didn't you instruct me not to see him?" But she went to fetch the child as she spoke.
    She handed the child to me, and we both couldn't help but burst out laughing. It turned out that this seventh child perfectly met the conditions for "staying" that my spouse and I had decided on. I kissed this newborn thing tightly, as if I had recovered a lost treasure. I said, "Even if you were a boy, I would still cherish you like this now!"

    母爱
    肇华
    这是我去年冬天在医院里的见闻和经历。
    当时我的第七个孩子要出世。我和我的爱人决定：“是女孩就留下自养，是男孩就送给别的同志养。”因为我们已有五个男孩，只有一个女孩。
    分娩前一天，我把这个决定告诉了护士同志，并且嘱她说：“假若是男孩，请不要叫我看见，让我爱人来安置。”护士同志感叹地说：“你可算得是重女轻男了。”她接着说了一个相反的“重男轻女”的故事：
    去年上半年，这医院在料理七、八位同时出院的产妇时，忙乱中把甲所生的男孩包札给乙，把乙所生的女孩包札给甲了。那时一对刚满七天的肥胖可爱的婴孩都酣睡着，两位母亲都不加细察，欢天喜地地带走了。
    当天下午，甲发现错误后就把女孩抱回医院要求换回男孩。医院立即通知同时出院的三位生女孩的产妇，请她们各自检查谁错领了孩子？第三天，三位母亲的答复都来了，只有乙的答复中加上了这一句话：“我本来生的是男孩子。”
    真相大白了。
    错误必须纠正，于是护士同志们作了一个很有趣的安排。她们约请乙在第四天下午五时到医院里来谈谈，并嘱她不必带孩子来。到时候，她们把这暂时无人承认的女孩用破布胡乱裹住，作了些化装工作，弄成又黄瘦又肮脏的模样，然后把她孤零零地放在一个小屋里，让她呱呱的哭。
    乙来了，护士们对她客气地叙述了这一错误事故后，就带她到小屋里看那个似乎被人遗弃的女孩。这时在破布中挣扎着的小生命哭号得更历害了，乙的神色马上不安起来，泪水充满眼眶。她略一犹豫，就把女孩抱到怀里喂起奶来，且愧且愤地说：“为什么把我的孩子蹧蹋成这样？我就不是这样的对待别人的孩子……”
    护士同志讲完这个故事后对我说：“我不相信你不要你生的男孩。”
    第二天，我的第七个孩子出世了。我在病床上休息了半天，头脑里忽然冒出裹着破布、又饥饿、又肮脏的婴孩形象。我于是烦躁不安起来，要求护士同志把我的孩子抱来看看。
    那护士同志笑起来说：“你不是嘱咐我不要看他么？”但她边说边抱孩子去了。
    她把孩子交给我，我们俩都不禁哈哈大笑起来，原来这第七个孩子正符合我和我爱人决定“留下来”的条件。我紧紧吻着这个新生的东西，好像失而复得一件宝贝一样。我说：“即使你是男孩，我现在还要这样爱护你的！”
