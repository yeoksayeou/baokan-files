Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from TASS: Khrushchev delivered a long speech at the celebration of the opening of the Moscow Lenin Central Stadium on July 31st. He talked about the achievements and existing problems of Soviet construction, as well as the current international situation, especially the issue of Egypt’s nationalization of the Suez Canal.

Khrushchev, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, congratulated the engineers, technicians, architects, and all workers who directly participated in the construction of the Central Stadium.

Khrushchev said that 1.36 million square meters of housing would be completed in Moscow in 1956. The plan for the first half of the year has been completed, but a large part of the work has to be completed in the remaining five months. These are mainly housing, public utilities, and welfare construction, which are directly related to improving the lives of the working people. He hoped that the construction personnel would devote their efforts to this kind of construction with the same attention and enthusiasm.

Khrushchev then spoke in detail about what he had seen during his recent inspection in the eastern region and some of the problems in Soviet agricultural work. He said that grain, mainly wheat, can be seen everywhere in the eastern reclamation areas. He pointed out that these reclamation areas have already achieved the expected success this year, and now everything depends on the harvest situation.

Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would receive more grain this year than ever before. He pointed out that the three republics of the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine would supply the state with 3.66 billion poods of grain.

He said that therefore, this year it will be possible to meet all the basic needs for grain, and especially the basic needs for high-quality grain. If there is still a reproach: that some cities reduced white bread and increased black bread at the end of the first year, then this year's harvest can ensure that the country first uses wheat to bake bread. People who like to eat white bread can be happy.

Khrushchev said that we cannot only talk about achievements, but must continue to do many things to consolidate these achievements. He pointed out that what has been done is far from enough to fully meet the needs of agricultural workers in the reclamation areas. Among them, especially the housing problem of wasteland workers, and it is also necessary to provide more various grain harvesters there.

He also said that many people have volunteered to go to the eastern region to harvest crops. However, this is a temporary job, and we cannot expect to do this every year, because that would cause some people to abandon their direct affairs, resulting in a great loss of labor resources, and cause a lot of inconvenience to these people. He believes that this patriotic enthusiasm should not be abused to cover up the shortcomings in the organization of agricultural harvesting work. He said that there must be more machines, so that all harvesting work can be done by machines as much as possible. And we have the technical and material conditions to do so.

Khrushchev said that the amount of milk and meat purchased in the first half of this year has increased significantly. Now the needs of many cities for milk, oil, and dairy products can be almost completely met. Although this is just the beginning. Now we should increase the amount of meat faster than the growth rate of demand.

Khrushchev said that other crops are also expected to have a bumper harvest this year. The planting area of ​​sugar beets in our country has greatly expanded. There is sufficient reason to predict that the amount of sugar beets harvested and produced this year will be much more than last year and the year before.

In short, if we look forward to the prospects of our grain harvest, then we can say that this year is a special and outstanding year.

Khrushchev then talked about some situations in industry. He said that the development of industry has also made its due contribution. But it must be pointed out that our industry still has great potential. Many industrial enterprises work unevenly, metal processing consumes a lot, a large amount of metal becomes chips, and many factories lack die-casting equipment.

Khrushchev said that construction occupies a special position in our economy. Now the housing problem is the most acute problem. We need a lot of housing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay great attention to solving the task of housing construction.

In order to accelerate housing construction and meet the needs as soon as possible, we should consider such a question. The houses we build are 3.2 meters high, while the houses in Britain, France and some other countries are 2.3 to 2.7 meters high. If housing construction in the Soviet Union is a little lower, then it is possible to build 10% to 15% more new housing.

He said that we should build economical and most convenient houses, and not pursue skyscrapers. The construction of high-rise buildings is not cost-effective in all aspects. Living on the twenty-sixth floor is not as good as living on the second or third floor. No experienced city resident would exchange a room on the second floor for a room on the twenty-sixth floor. Moreover, it is much cheaper to build three- or four-story buildings, and it is much more convenient to use. We should widely build three-, four-, and five-story buildings.

Housing and cultural welfare housing construction must be carried out extensively not only in large cities, but also in small cities, workers' residential areas and collective farms. One- and two-story houses, or one-story houses with lofts, should be built.

Khrushchev said that if we want to summarize the situation of our construction and the tasks in the future, then we need to make such a general conclusion: now the most lacking thing for our construction personnel is the lack of a high level of construction, and the lack of organization.

Khrushchev then talked about some issues in the international situation. He said that we are working towards this direction, and striving to realize the great Leninist principle that socialist countries and capitalist countries can coexist peacefully, and strive to avoid war. We put forward the task of not only avoiding war, but also creating conditions for the normal development of trade, scientific and cultural ties, and the exchange of travelers. We will do our best to do everything necessary for the peaceful coexistence of the two systems to eliminate the possibility of war, and patiently solve all the problems that arise in the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation among countries. He cited many things that the Soviet Union has done in this regard in the past two or three years.

Khrushchev said, "We hope to end the state of war with Japan now, conclude a peace treaty with it, and restore diplomatic relations. Now we have begun negotiations with Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu in Moscow. We will do everything necessary to make this negotiation a successful conclusion."

Khrushchev said, "We believe that other countries do not want war now, just as we and all socialist countries do not want war. This can be seen from some of the recent talks. We don’t need to mention India, Burma and Afghanistan, because they not only do not want a new war, but also are fighting for no war. Even when we talked with Mr. Eden and his colleagues in the United Kingdom, and when we talked with French government representatives Mollet, Pineau and others, we had this feeling."

Khrushchev then emphasized the issue of Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal. He said, "Now a cloud that causes tension between some countries has appeared on the horizon. I am referring to the Egyptian government's action of nationalizing the Suez Canal. This action has caused excessive excitement in some Western countries, especially Britain and France. There are even irrational shouts, calling for some kind of forceful means, even saying that military action should be taken. I believe that the rational judgment, experience and sober political mind of the national leaders of Britain and France will eventually enable them to correctly understand this historic action, so as to draw corresponding conclusions."

Khrushchev believed that there is no illegal act here at all. Because the Suez Canal is in Egypt, it flows through Egyptian land, and it was built by Arabs, Egyptian residents with their own hands. But in the past it was not in the hands of Egyptians.

He said that many years have passed since then. However, times are changing, and international relations and the interrelationships between the peoples of all countries are also changing. The people of colonial countries are breaking free from colonial oppression and declaring their rights. Therefore, the British government's decision to grant independence to India and Burma and withdraw British troops from the Suez Canal area is wise.

Khrushchev said, "I believe that the nationalization of the Suez Canal is a matter that a sovereign government like the Egyptian government has full power to handle. It should be emphasized that Egypt has guaranteed respect for freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and compensation for the shares of the company's shareholders. Therefore, this action should be assessed calmly and the new situation and the spirit of the times should be considered soberly. There is no other way out."

"We believe that it is wrong to adopt a policy of exerting pressure on Egypt, just as on other sovereign countries. Taking excessive measures and hasty measures on this issue will only bring bad results to the cause of peace and will cause the Western countries themselves to suffer losses in this region." The nationalization of the Suez Canal has not harmed the interests of the people of Britain, France, the United States and other countries."

"The Soviet Union, which directly cares about maintaining the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, has noticed the Egyptian government's statement that the Suez Canal is open to everyone, and believes that it is unfounded to show nervousness and anxiety on this issue. We are deeply convinced that if external forces do not artificially sharpen the situation in the Suez Canal region, then the situation in this region will not be sharpened."

"When talking about this, we hope that the British government and the public in Britain and France will correctly understand us. We want to be loyal to the principles of justice. At the same time, we believe that the Suez Canal issue can and should be resolved peacefully. There is no reason whatsoever to create tension in the Mediterranean region, especially to provoke international hatred, for the sake of the Suez Canal."

He pointed out that this is especially important now, because now the people of all countries are unwilling to undermine peaceful coexistence. Governments and countries have all means to peacefully negotiate and resolve disputes based on the principle of equality. Therefore, remarks that incite hatred and encourage aggression are reckless. This kind of incitement should be severely condemned.

Khrushchev said that there is no basis for inciting war against the legitimate actions taken by the autonomous Egyptian government. At the same time, we hope that this decision can be correctly understood by other countries, and hope that this decision will not become an excuse for disputes, but on the contrary, will help to eliminate such abnormal interrelationships: some countries enslave other countries or exploit them, thus preparing fertile ground for abnormal and sharp relations between countries. Eliminating this situation can normalize relations, which should be based on mutual understanding and recognition of each other's interests, and should be based on equal agreements.

Khrushchev finally said that the Soviet Union has always pursued and will continue to pursue a policy of developing normal and peaceful relations among countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa and Australia. Our relations with Britain and France have recently improved, and this relationship is developing in a good direction. We are convinced that this relationship will continue to develop well in the future, because this is in the interests of the Soviet people and the British and French people.

    在庆祝莫斯科列宁中央运动场开幕大会上
    赫鲁晓夫谈苏联经济建设和国际形势
    指出苏彝士运河国有化是埃及政府有全权处理的问题
    并认为有关运河的问题能够而且应该用和平办法解决
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社讯：赫鲁晓夫七月三十一日在庆祝莫斯科列宁中央运动场开幕的大会上发表了长篇演说。他谈到了苏联建设事业的成就和存在的问题，也谈到了目前的国际形势，特别是埃及收归苏彝士运河的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫代表苏联共产党中央委员会向直接参加中央运动场建设的工程师、技师、建筑师和全体工人致贺。
    赫鲁晓夫说，1956年要在莫斯科建成一百三十六万平方公尺住宅。上半年的计划已经完成，但是很大一部分工作还得在剩下的五个月中来完成。这些主要是住宅、公用事业和生活福利事业建设，是直接同改进劳动人民生活有关的建设。他希望建筑人员也以同样的注意和热忱把自己的力量用在这种建筑上。
    赫鲁晓夫接着详细谈到他最近在东部地区视察看到的情况和苏联农业工作中的一些问题。他说，在东部垦荒地区，到处都可以看到粮食，主要是小麦。他指出，这些垦区今年已经取得了预期的成就，现在一切就看庄稼收获的情况如何。
    赫鲁晓夫宣布，苏联今年将得到过去从来没有得到过那么多的粮食。他指出，俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克和乌克兰三个共和国将供给国家三十六亿六千万普特谷物。
    他说，因此，今年将可以满足对谷物上的一切基本需要，并且是满足优等谷物的基本需要。如果说现在还有所责难：认为头一年底有某些城市减少了白面包，而增加了黑面包，那么今年庄稼的收成就可以保证国家首先用小麦烤面包。爱吃白面包的人可以开心了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们不能只谈成绩，而要继续作许多的事来巩固这些成绩。他指出，对于完全满足垦区农业劳动者的需要来说，已做的还是远远不够的。其中特别是荒地工作人员的住宅问题，还有必要供给那里更多的各种谷物收获机。
    他又说，已经有许多人自愿到东部地区去收割庄稼。但是，这是一种临时性的工作，不能指望年年都这样作，因为那样会使一些人抛开了直接事务，而造成很大的劳动资源的损失，并且给这些人造成很多不便。他认为，不能滥用这种爱国热情，而淹没了农业收获工作组织中的缺点。他说，必须要有更多的机器，使一切收获工作尽量用机器来做。而我们是有技术条件和物质条件来这样做的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，今年上半年奶和肉类收购数量有很大的增加。现在有许多城市对牛奶、油和奶制品的需要，差不多完全可以得到满足。虽然这仅仅是一个开始。现在还应该使肉类增加得比需求增长的速度更快些。
    赫鲁晓夫说，其他农作物今年也可望获得丰收。我国甜菜播种面积大大扩大了。有充分根据预测，今年收获的甜菜和生产出来的糖将比去年和前年要多得多。
    总之，如果瞻望一下我们收获粮食的远景，那么可以说，今年是特别的、突出的一年。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到工业中的一些情况。他说，工业的发展也作出应有的贡献。但是必须指出，我们的工业还有很大的潜力。许多工业企业工作得不匀称，金属加工的时候耗损很大，大量的金属变成了切屑，许多工厂缺少模压设备。
    赫鲁晓夫说，建设在我们的经济中占特殊的地位。现在住房问题是最尖锐的问题。我们需要许多住房。因此，需要非常注意解决住房建设的任务。
    为了加速住房的建造和尽速地满足需求，应当考虑这样一个问题。我们建造的住房高三·二公尺，而英国、法国和某些其他国家的住房高二·三到二·七公尺。如果苏联的住房建设再低一些，那么就有可能多建设10％到15％的新的住房。
    他说，应当建造经济的、使用最便利的房屋，不要追求摩天大楼。高楼的建设在各个方面来说都不合算的。住在二十六层楼上不如住在二、三层楼上好，任何一个有经验的城市居民都不会拿二层楼的房间去换二十六层楼的房间。而且建造三、四层的楼房要便宜很多，使用起来要方便得多。我们应当广泛建设三、四、五层的楼房。
    不仅在大城市、而且小城市、工人居住区和集体农庄中都必须广泛开展住房和文化生活福利房舍的建设。应当建设一层和两层的房子，或是带有阁楼的一层的房子。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果要概括一下我们建筑的状况和今后的任务，那就须要作出这样一个总的结论：现在我们建筑人员最为不够的地方就是缺乏高度的建筑水平，缺乏组织性。
    赫鲁晓夫随后谈到国际局势一些问题。他说，我们在朝着这个方向努力，并且竭力争取实现伟大的列宁制定的关于社会主义国家和资本主义国家可以和平共处的原理，争取避免战争。我们提出任务不只要避免战争，而且要创造条件，以便正常地发展贸易、科学文化联系，互派旅行者，只要是两个制度的和平共处所必需的，我们都尽力去做，要消除发生战争的可能性，耐心地、本着互相谅解和各国合作的精神解决所发生的一切问题。他举出了最近两三年来苏联在这方面所做的很多工作。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们希望现在结束同日本的战争状态，同它缔结和约和恢复外交关系。现在我们已经开始同日本外务相重光葵先生在莫斯科举行谈判。我们将做一切必要的事情以使这次谈判圆满结束”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们认为，其他国家现在也不希望战争，正如同我们和所有社会主义国家不希望战争一样。从最近所进行的一些会谈就可以看出这点。我们用不着提印度、缅甸和阿富汗，因为它们不仅不希望新的战争，而且在为没有战争而斗争。就是我们在英国同艾登先生和他的同事们会谈的时候，以及在同法国政府代表摩勒、比诺和其他人会谈的时候，也有这种感觉”。
    赫鲁晓夫接着强调谈到埃及收回苏彝士运河的问题。他说，“现在地平线上出现了一朵造成某些国家之间的紧张关系的乌云。我指的是关于埃及政府把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动。这一行动引起了某些西方国家，特别是英国和法国的过份的激动。那里甚至还发出不理智的喊声，高叫采取某种强力手段，甚至说要采取军事行动。我认为，英国和法国的国家领导人的理智的判断、经验和清醒的政治头脑终究会使他们正确地理解这一历史性的行动，从而得出相应的结论的”。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，这里根本不存在什么违法的行为。因为苏彝士运河是在埃及，它流过埃及的土地，它是由阿拉伯人、埃及的居民亲手建成的。但是过去它却不在埃及人手中。
    他说，从那时以来，许多年过去了。不过时代在改变，国际关系和各国人民之间的相互关系也在改变。殖民地国家的人民纷纷挣脱殖民压迫，并且宣布自己的权利。因此，英国政府关于让印度和缅甸独立以及从苏彝士运河地区撤退英国军队的决定是明智的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我认为，苏彝士运河国有化是像埃及政府这样一个有主权的政府有全权处理的事情。应该着重指出，埃及已经保证尊重在苏彝士运河通航的自由，并且偿付这家公司股票持有者的股金。因此，应该冷静地估计这一行动，清醒地考虑新的局势和时代的精神。其他出路是没有的”。
    “我们认为，对埃及，正像对其他主权国家一样，采用施加压力的政策是错误的。在这个问题上采取过份的做法以及急躁的做法只会给和平事业带来不良结果，会使西方国家自己在这一地区的利益遭受损失。”苏彝士运河国有化没有损害英国、法国、美国和其他国家的人民的利益”。
    “对维护苏彝士运河的通航自由表示直接的关心的苏联，注意到了埃及政府关于苏彝士运河对所有的人畅通这一声明，认为在这个问题上表现出神经过敏和不安情绪是毫无根据的。我们深信，如果外力不人为地使苏彝士运河地区的局势尖锐化，那么这一地区的局势是不会尖锐起来的。”
    “在谈到这一点的时候，我们希望英国政府以及英国和法国的公众正确地了解我们。我们要忠于正义的原则。同时我们认为，苏彝士运河问题能够而且应该用和平办法解决。为了苏彝士运河，在地中海地区造成紧张局面，尤其是挑起国际间的仇恨，那是没有任何理由的。”
    他指出，这在现在尤其重要，因为现在各国人民都不愿意破坏和平共处。各国政府和各个国家拥有一切办法，根据平等的原则来和平协商解决纠纷问题。因此，激起仇恨和怂恿侵略行为的言论是轻率的。这种煽动行为应该加以猛烈的指责。
    赫鲁晓夫说，没有什么根据可以对自主的埃及政府采取的合法行动煽起战争。同时我们希望，这一决定能够得到其他国家的正确谅解，希望这一决定不致成为纷争的借口，而且相反地有助于消除这样一些不正常的相互关系：一些国家奴役另外一些国家或是剥削它们，因而给国与国之间不正常的、尖锐的关系准备了沃壤。消除这种状况，就可以使关系正常化，这种关系应当建立在相互谅解和承认彼此利益的基础上，应当建立在平等协议的基础上。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联过去和将来所执行的一直是发展欧洲、亚洲、美洲、非洲和澳洲各国的正常的和平关系的政策。我们同英国和法国的关系最近有了改进，这种关系正在朝着好的方向发展，我们确信，这种关系今后仍将得到良好的发展，因为这是符合苏联人民和英法人民的利益的。
