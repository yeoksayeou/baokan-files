    A Film Projection Team on the Borderline
    Tang Peize
    The people of all ethnic groups in Lianshan County, Yunnan Province, which lies on the border, had long been looking forward to having a film projection team come to their area. This spring, the 87th Film Projection Team was dispatched here. The three members of the projection team belong to three different ethnic groups. The team leader is a simple and honest Dai peasant son, one projectionist is a hardworking Jingpo girl, and the other is a Han team member. Wherever they went, the people of all ethnic groups received them like their own relatives. When they couldn't find a caravan, everyone helped them transport the equipment, and when they couldn't find a screening venue, everyone helped them find a suitable venue.
    The expectations of the people of all ethnic groups and their family-like care encouraged these three young people. They always remembered that they were propaganda workers of the Party, and the three of them were a fighting unit. It was not easy to ensure that the masses of all ethnic groups could understand the content of the films. However, they took advantage of the team's favorable conditions: in Dai areas, the Dai team member was responsible for propaganda; in Jingpo areas, the Jingpo team member was responsible for propaganda; and in Han areas, the Han team member was responsible for propaganda; the three of them were united as one. They also used Chinese, Dai, and Jingpo languages for propaganda. Before screenings or on the streets, they often used folk songs, clapper talks, storytelling, radio broadcasts, and other forms popular with the masses for propaganda. Sometimes, when they encountered elderly women and children on the road, the projection team members did not miss the opportunity. They also frequently went deep into the masses to conduct individual interviews. When the masses understood the truth, they naturally became propaganda workers themselves. Thanks to these efforts, the 87th Film Projection Team not only achieved good results in film propaganda but also established close and deep friendships with the local people. Some people said, "I never thought that people from our own ethnic group would come to show us movies. It's really good under Chairman Mao's leadership." A Dai old woman in her sixties shed tears of excitement after watching a movie. She said, "This is the first time I have seen a movie in my life, and it is also the first time I have seen people from our Dai ethnic group show movies!"
    In order to ensure that there were no malfunctions during each screening, the projection team members took great care of the equipment. During the rainy season, when climbing mountains and crossing rivers, the team members personally carried the loads on their backs; usually, they always took the important parts off and kept them by their side. Once, just as they reached a mountain peak, a rainstorm came, and the Jingpo girl, Lei Mudong, immediately took off her clothes to cover the machine. Their care for the projector allowed it to fully发挥 its effectiveness, enabling people of all ethnic groups to regularly see moving movies.

    国境线上的一支电影放映队
    唐沛泽
    在国境上的云南省莲山县的各族人民，早就盼望着有个电影放映队到他们那里。今年春天，第八十七放映小队被派到这里来了。放映队的三个人，属于三种不同的民族。小队长是朴实的傣族农民子弟，放映员一个是个勤劳苦干的景颇族姑娘，另外一个是汉族队员。他们到了哪里，哪里的各族群众像接待自己的亲人一样接待他们。当找不着马帮的时候，大家帮他们接送机器，找不着放映场地的时候，大家给他们找好合适的场地。
    各族群众的期望和亲人般的关怀，鼓舞了这三个年轻人，他们时刻记住自己是党的宣传员，三个人就是一个战斗单位。要使各民族的群众都能看懂影片的内容，并不是一件容易的事情。但是，他们利用了小队的有利条件：在傣族地区放映，由傣族队员担任宣传；在景颇族地区放映，就由景颇族队员宣传；在汉族地区，就由汉族队员宣传；三个人团结得像一个人。他们也采用汉、傣、景颇三种语言宣传。在放映前或在街头上，他们常常采用群众喜欢的山歌、快板、说唱、广播等形式进行宣传。有时在路上碰上了老大妈和孩子，放映队员们也不放过机会。他们还经常深入群众中作个别访问。当群众懂得了道理后，自然而然地也当了宣传员。由于这样的努力，第八十七放映小队不仅在电影宣传上收到了良好的效果，而且和当地群众建立了亲密深厚的友谊。有的群众说：“想不到，有我们本民族的人来放电影给我们看了，真是毛主席领导的好。”一位六十多岁的傣族老大妈看电影后激动得流出了眼泪，她说：“我这一生第一次看电影，也是第一次见我们傣族人放电影！”
    为了保证每次放映不出故障，放映队员们对机器十分爱护。在雨季上大山，过大河时，队员们亲自背着驮子走；平常，总是把重要零件取下来放在身边。有一次，刚走到一个大山头的时候，暴风雨来了，景颇族姑娘雷木东立即脱下自己的衣服来盖着机器。他们这样爱护放映机，使放映机充分发挥了它的效能，使各族群众能经常看到动人的电影。
