    "Passing By With Head Held High"
    Yue Jun
    "China Youth" magazine published a cartoon satirizing college students who "passed by with head held high" when they saw professors. No one would advocate that students should perform the kowtow ritual before their teachers, but "passing by with head held high" is indeed an abnormal phenomenon.
    Studying at a university is merely stepping into the gate of science; it is still very far from the peak of science. If one becomes conceited just because they are a college student, looking down on everyone and thinking, "What's so great about you!" when they see a professor, that is truly an "amazing" attitude!
    Some people criticized disrespectful college students by citing the fable of the tiger apprenticing to the cat (see "College Student Attitude" in the July 5th issue of China Youth Daily). Of course, we are not in the era of "teach the apprentice, starve the master," and teachers don't have to worry about starving to death, so they don't need to hold back any skills. However, behavior as proud and ungrateful as the tiger's is always repulsive.
    Today, we certainly don't need to restore the feudal, patriarchal teacher-student relationship of "honoring the teacher and valuing the Way," but respecting teachers is still a virtue. Teachers are beloved elders; the new teacher-student relationship is a comradeship. Students respect teachers, teachers love students, and teachers and students learn from each other, especially the former learning from the latter, which is conducive to teaching. Many knowledgeable professors even humbly express their willingness to learn from young people, while inexperienced young people look down on teachers and disrespect them. What can this illustrate other than being immature and ridiculous?
    Learning cannot tolerate the slightest bit of boasting and arrogance. Not learning from predecessors, not learning from teachers, is tantamount to cutting off the path to progress. Since ancient times, great scholars have been very humble. The more someone loves to learn, the more humble they are; the more humble they are, the more they love to learn; the more they love to learn, the more knowledgeable they become. But if someone holds their head high, pretending to be very knowledgeable, they may not really have much knowledge. Isn't this worthy of vigilance from proud and complacent young people?

### “昂首而过”

    “昂首而过”
    岳军
    “中国青年”登过一幅漫画，讽刺见了教授昂首而过的大学生。谁也不会主张学生见了老师要行三跪九叩礼，但“昂首而过”的确是一种反常现象。
    在大学里念书，只不过刚夸进科学之门，离开科学之峰，还远得很哩。如果因为自己是大学生，就目空一切，见了教授，也眼睛朝天，心里想：“你有什么了不起！”这真是“了不起”的派头！
    有人批评不尊师的大学生，引了老虎拜猫为师的寓言（见七月五日中国青年报“大学生派头”一文）。当然，现在不是“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”的时代，老师们不必担心饿死，因而不必留下一手。但是，像老虎那样骄傲忘本的行为，总使人感到厌恶。
    今天固然不必恢复“隆师重道”的封建家长式的师生关系，然而尊师，仍不失为人之美德。老师是亲爱的长辈；新的师生关系，是同志关系。生尊师，师爱生，师生互相学习，特别是后者向前者学习，才有利于教学。很多饱学的教授还虚心表示要向青年们学习，而初学的青年反而瞧不起老师、不尊重老师，这除了显得幼稚可笑以外，还能说明什么呢？
    学习，来不得半点虚夸和骄傲。不向前人学习，不向老师学习，不啻自绝前进之路。自古以来的大学问家，都是很谦逊的。一个人越好学，就越谦逊；越谦逊，就越好学；越好学，就越有学问。而一个人眼睛长在头顶上，像煞很有学问，倒未必真有学问。这难道不值得骄傲自满的青年人警惕吗？
