Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th - Workers in Shenyang are actively engaged in a campaign to recycle scrap steel. According to statistics from 54 factories including Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, Shenyang Smelting Plant, and Shenyang Bridge Plant, they recovered more than 47,000 tons of scrap steel for the state from January to June this year.

These factories began to pay attention to the recycling of scrap steel at the beginning of this year. Workers spontaneously organized shock brigades and economization teams. Most factories established scrap steel collection stations and warehouses. Workers at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant collected more than 2,000 tons of scrap steel from the factory's open spaces and workshops. Workers at the Shenyang Smelting Plant dug up more than ten tons of waste mechanical parts buried underground near the factory's railway siding before liberation. Workers in each factory also selected many usable materials from the piles of scrap steel and used them in production.

Among the scrap steel recycled by various units, scrap steel alone can be re-smelted into more than 20,000 tons of good steel.

    沈阳市职工积极回收废钢铁
    新华社沈阳10日电　沈阳市广大职工积极展开回收废钢铁的活动。据沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳冶炼厂、沈阳桥梁厂等五十四个工厂的统计，从今年一月到六月份就给国家回收了废钢铁四万七千多吨。
    这些工厂从今年年初起，就开始注意了废钢铁的回收工作。工人们自动地组织了突击队和节约队。大多数工厂建立了废钢铁收集站和仓库。沈阳矿山机器厂的工人们，从工厂的旷场和车间里收集了二千多吨废钢材。沈阳冶炼厂的工人从厂内铁路专用线附近，就挖出了解放前埋藏在地下的废机械零件十多吨。各厂工人还从废钢铁堆里，挑选出许多可以使用的材料，用到生产上去。
    在各单位回收的废钢铁中，仅废钢就可以重新制出好钢材二万多吨。
