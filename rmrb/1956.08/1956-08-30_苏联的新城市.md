    The White City on the Angara River
    Where the muddy waters of the Kitoy River flow into the Angara, stretches Angarsk, the youngest city in the Baikal region. People transported powerful machines here, cleared the great forest, and then, as in a fairy tale, a white city rapidly grew in the jungle.
    The construction of Angarsk was carried out strictly according to plan from the very beginning. Moscow Avenue is the longest and most beautiful avenue running through the city from south to north. The houses in the city are built of white stone and are very beautiful. At the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, Angarsk had already built 400,000 square meters of housing, fifteen schools, four clubs, two cinemas, and thirty-eight kindergartens. The Palace of Culture opened last May. It has a spacious theater with eight hundred seats, lounges, and dozens of rooms for amateur art groups to use. Next to the Palace of Culture is the library. In addition, the Central Post and Telecommunications Building was completed more than two months ago, and now this white stone city in the great forest can talk to major cities such as Moscow and Kyiv every day.
    The residents of the new city are also working hard to decorate their city, with broad, straight streets lined with greenery. Hundred-year-old pine trees have been preserved in the courtyards and street gardens, witnesses of the great forest of years ago.
    Not only is Angarsk the youngest city, but its residents are also young, with 48% of the residents being under the age of eighteen. Angarsk is developing vigorously like youth. People from all over the country come here to participate in the construction of oil refineries, reinforced concrete structure factories, and the great cause of the Soviet Union's development of the East.
  City of Hydroelectric Station Builders
    On the left bank of the beautiful Volga River, not far from the heroic city of Stalingrad, a brand-new city has appeared. The riverside streets are lined with beautiful and comfortable two-story houses, and newly planted saplings sway in the wind on the sidewalks. Buses run on newly paved asphalt roads, shops are always full of customers, the civil registry office registers marriages for young lovers, the obstetrics hospital is busy with newborn little citizens, the fashion store has a backlog of orders... In short, this young city lives a vibrant life. Who could have imagined that four years ago this was still a steppe covered with sagebrush!
    In 1952, with the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, the builders laid the foundation for the first house in the new city, which has been named "Volga". This is the city of the hydroelectric station builders. In just a few years, 1,200 houses have been built, and now there are tens of thousands of residents. Currently, there are eight primary and secondary schools, a power construction technical school, two hospitals, two clinics, as well as an obstetrics hospital, a tuberculosis prevention and treatment center, and a cultural and recreation park. In addition to a theater with 850 seats, the newly built Palace of Culture has 125 rooms for various recreational activities.
    Planting trees in this windy steppe area is originally relatively difficult. However, the residents of this new city have planted tens of thousands of locust trees, willows, and small oak trees to decorate their city. In addition, they have also planted more than 2 million flowers and plants to make the city more beautiful. (Attached picture)

    苏联的新城市
    安加拉河畔的白色城
    在吉托伊河的浊流注入安加拉河的地方，伸延着贝加尔湖一带最年轻的城市——安加尔斯克。人们把强大的机器运到这里来，开辟了大森林，于是像在童话中所说的那样，一座白色的城市迅速地在丛林中生长起来了。
    安加尔斯克城的建筑工作，一开始就是严格按照计划进行的。莫斯科大街是从南到北贯穿全城的一条最长最漂亮的大街。城里的房子是用白色石头盖成的，非常美观。在第五个五年计划末，安加尔斯克已经建起了四十万平方公尺的住宅，十五所学校，四个俱乐部，两个电影院和三十八个幼儿园。去年5月，文化宫开幕了。它里面有宽敞的八百个座位的剧场、休息室和几十个为业余艺术小组活动用的房间。文化宫的旁边是图书馆。此外，两个多月以前，中央邮电大厦也已落成，现在这个大森林中的白色石头城可以每天同莫斯科、基辅等大城市通话了。
    新城市的居民们也在努力装饰自己的城市，宽阔笔直的街道两旁布满了绿荫。院子里和街心花园里还保留着百年老松，它们是几年以前的大森林留下的证人。
    安加尔斯克不仅城市本身是最年青的，而且它的居民也是年青的，居民中有48％都是年在十八岁以下的少年。安加尔斯克也像青年一样蓬勃地发展着。人们从全国各地到这儿来参加炼油厂、钢筋混凝土结构工厂的建设工作，参加苏联开发东部的伟大事业。
  水电站建筑者的城市
    在美丽的伏尔加河左岸，距英雄城斯大林格勒不远的地方，出现了一座崭新的城市。这里的沿河大街上全是两层楼的漂亮舒适的住宅，人行道上新种的小树迎风摇摆。公共汽车奔驰在新铺的沥青马路上，商店里经常是顾客盈门，民事登记处为年轻的恋人进行结婚登记，产科医院为新生的小公民忙着，时装店积压着大批订单……总之，这个年轻的城市生气勃勃地生活着。谁能想得到，四年以前这里还是一片长满了苦艾的草原呢！
    1952年，随着斯大林格勒水电站的建设，建筑者们才为这座已命名为“伏尔加”的新城市打下了第一所房子的地基。这是水电站建筑者的城市。短短的几年时光，它已建好了一千二百幢房屋，现在，已有好几万居民了。目前，这里有八所中、小学校，一所动力建筑专科学校，两所医院，两个诊疗所，还有产科医院、结核病防治所、文化休息公园等。新落成的文化宫里除去一个有八百五十个座位的剧场外，还有一百二十五个供各种文娱活动用的房间。
    在这多风的草原地带种树原是比较困难的。但是，这个新城市的居民已种了几万株槐树、柳树和小橡树来装饰自己的城市，除此以外，他们为了使城市更加美丽，还种了二百多万棵花草。（附图片）
