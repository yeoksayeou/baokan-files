    Promote Advanced Experiences, Pay Attention to Thrifty Savings
    Young Workers Across the Country Actively Save Steel and Cement
    (Our Newspaper) News: A movement to save steel and cement has been widely launched among young workers across the country. Especially young workers in basic construction and machinery industry units have more actively participated in this activity.
    In the movement to save steel and cement, young workers took the lead in promoting various advanced saving experiences. Young workers from the Northeast Second Engineering Company took the lead in promoting dozens of advanced experiences such as cold-drawn steel bars and dry-hard concrete. Young workers from units under the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways generally adopted advanced experiences such as "stone masonry with mortar squeezing" and "concrete with infiltrated rubble," which reduced cement consumption. In the first half of this year, they saved more than 500 tons of cement. The "Jiang Youjin and Shi Jianglang Steel Bar Worker Youth Shock Brigade" of the Northwest First Engineering Company can pull out 340 meters more steel bars per day using cold-drawing machines, saving more than 6,100 kilograms of steel bars in May and June.
    The activity of collecting waste materials has not been interrupted among young workers since last year. Wang Dezhi, a national advanced producer and cement worker, and the youth shock brigade he leads, stipulated that Tuesdays and Fridays are savings activity days from July last year to now. In the first half of this year alone, they saved 32 bags of cement by collecting scattered cement on the site. The processing plant of the Northwest First Engineering Company set up six savings boxes, attracting more than 600 young people to participate in this activity, recovering more than 15 tons of steel in the past three months. The Third Workshop of Tianjin Daming Steel Rolling Plant recently organized a savings team, collecting more than 10 tons of waste steel.
    Many young people paid attention to small savings in production, and they put forward the slogan of "no waste of a drop of mortar, no waste of an inch of steel." Young workers at the Anshan Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant launched a movement to save small pieces of steel and iron, carefully calculating in production, saving 869 tons of steel for the country in the first half of this year and recovering 206 tons of old steel. The Youth Braking Group of the Jiamusi Locomotive Depot has implemented a "no new material requisition" work day since February this year, trying to use old parts and repair and assemble waste products as much as possible, and has already repaired 18 locomotives.
    In this activity, many young technicians studied saving methods from various aspects and put forward rationalization proposals. Young technicians from the Design Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Urban Construction Bureau organized a special group to review design drawings, and put forward many suggestions for modifying designs and using substitutes, saving 580 tons of cement and 36 tons of steel for the country. Qiu Jia'an, a young technician from the Fourth Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry, found that the design strength requirements for steel bars were too high when reviewing the designs of the Northwest First Printing and Dyeing Factory and other factories. He proposed using No. 3 steel bars instead of the originally designed No. 0 steel bars, saving 80 to 90 tons of steel bars.
    In order to fully mobilize internal resources, young material management personnel carried out warehouse inventory work. Zhou Dali, a material manager at the Tianjin Power Machine Plant, took the initiative to classify the remaining inventory materials and distributed them to workers under the premise of not affecting product quality, saving 14 tons of good steel for the country in the first half of the year.

    推广先进经验，注意点滴节约
    全国青年职工积极节约钢材水泥
    本报讯　节约钢材和水泥的活动，已经在全国青年职工中广泛地开展起来。特别是基本建设和机械工业单位的青年职工，更积极地参加了这一活动。
    在节约钢材和水泥的活动中，青年职工带头推广了各种先进的节约经验。东北第二工程公司青年职工带头推广了冷拉钢筋、干硬性混凝土等几十种先进经验。铁道部第三工程局所属单位的青年职工，普遍采用了“砌石挤浆”和“混凝土渗片石”等先进经验，降低了水泥用量，今年上半年就节约了水泥五百多吨。西北第一工程公司“蒋有金、施江郎钢筋工青年突击队”，利用冷拉机器每天可多拉出三百四十公尺的钢筋，在五、六月份节约了六千一百多公斤钢筋。
    搜集废料的活动，自去年以来，在青年职工中一直没有中断过。全国先进生产者代表、水泥工王德智和他领导的青年突击队，从去年七月到现在，规定每星期二、五为节约活动日，仅今年上半年他们把抛散在现场的水泥集零为整，就节约了水泥三十二袋。西北第一工程公司加工厂设立了六只节约箱，吸引了六百多名青年参加了这一活动，三个月来共回收了钢材十五吨多。天津大明轧钢厂三车间，最近组织了一支节约队，收捡了废旧钢材十吨多。
    很多青年在生产中注意了点滴节约，他们提出了“不浪费一滴灰浆、不浪费一寸钢材”的口号。鞍山金属结构制造厂的青年职工，开展了节约寸钢块铁运动，在生产中精打细算，今年上半年就为国家节省了钢材八百六十九吨，并且回收了旧钢材二百零六吨。佳木斯机务段青年制动组，今年二月以来，实行不领新料工作日，尽量利用旧零件和加修、配修废品，已经修理了十八台机车。
    在这一活动中，很多青年技术人员从多方面研究了节约的办法，提出了合理化建议。江西省城市建设局设计室的青年技术人员，组织了审查设计图纸的专门小组，提出了许多修改设计和采用代用品的建议，为国家节约了水泥五百八十吨、钢筋三十六吨。纺织工业部第四建筑安装工程公司青年技术员裘家安，在审查西北第一印染厂等厂的设计的时候，发现钢筋的设计强度要求过高，提出了采用三号钢筋代替原设计采用的零号钢筋的建议，节约了八、九十吨钢筋。
    为了把内部资源充分动员起来，青年材料管理人员开展了清查仓库的工作。天津动力机厂材料管理员周大理，将库存残料主动分类，在不影响产品质量的前提下分配给工人，上半年就为国家节约了十四吨好钢材。　（雷亨民）
