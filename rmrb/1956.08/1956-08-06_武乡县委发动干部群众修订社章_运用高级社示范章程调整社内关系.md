    Wu Xiang County Party Committee Mobilizes Cadres and Masses to Revise Cooperative Charters
    Using Advanced Cooperative Model Charters to Adjust Internal Relations
    (Our report) The Chinese Communist Party Wu Xiang County Committee, Shanxi Province, is organizing all agricultural production cooperatives in the county to study the "Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and is actively leading the work of revising cooperative charters.
    After advanced cooperativization, Wu Xiang County experienced inconsistencies in thinking between cooperative cadres and members, and abnormal internal relations within the cooperatives. Some cadres only cared about the collective interests of the cooperative and did not care about the well-being of the members; some cooperatives only focused on agricultural production and abandoned diversified operations. Members reflected: "The flowing water is blocked, turning it into stagnant water, and there is no pocket money!" Some cooperative cadres had poor work styles, even being selfish and engaging in departmentalism and disunity. Among the members, some only cared about personal interests, did not participate well in cooperative labor, and did not cherish public property. Some cooperatives had unsound financial systems, and the prices of collectivized means of production were unreasonable, leading to diverse opinions among the members.
    After the promulgation of the "Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the Wu Xiang County Party Committee conscientiously studied and discussed it, realizing that this was an extremely important document and should be used as a standard to solve some important existing problems within the cooperatives. First, led by members of the County Party Committee, 55 reporters, including the heads and deputy heads of various departments, deputy county heads, and the director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, conducted collective study; at the same time, they drafted outlines for teaching basic-level cadres and the content of reports to the masses. Next, the reporters went to 210 agricultural production cooperatives in the county to conduct reports and publicity on a large scale. The 6,400 propagandists in the county also conducted systematic study under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, and then carried out extensive publicity activities in various forms, and organized mass discussions. So far, of the 56,900 members in the 210 cooperatives in the county, more than 52,900 have received education on the cooperative charter, accounting for more than 93% of the total number of members.
    After studying the cooperative charter, basic-level cadres and some members examined their own thinking. After studying, the cadres of the Nanping Agricultural Cooperative overcame the tendency to neglect leading members in developing sideline production, revised the production plan, and decided to make up for the reduced income in the first half of the year in the second half of the year. The members of Ma Village and Gancao Bei overcame their mutual suspicion and resolved to unite in production in the future.
    After publicizing the cooperative charter, all agricultural cooperatives universally mobilized members to revise the original cooperative charter in accordance with the spirit of the charter and in response to the current problems existing within the cooperative. Some cooperatives conducted a full-year distribution trial calculation based on the distribution principles stipulated in the Model Charter for Advanced Cooperatives. All cooperatives universally revised their cooperative charters in accordance with Article 33 of the Model Charter for Advanced Cooperatives, implemented an overproduction reward system, and established and improved financial systems in accordance with Article 41. Some cooperatives resolved problems such as unreasonable prices for means of production entering the cooperative and the lack of a repayment period in accordance with the Model Charter for Advanced Cooperatives. At present, the work of revising the cooperative charters of all 210 agricultural cooperatives in the county has been completed.
    After publicizing and revising the cooperative charter, the internal relations of the cooperatives have been preliminarily adjusted, and the ideological level of the members has also been generally improved, greatly promoting current production. All 210 agricultural cooperatives in the county have plowed more than 56,000 mu of wheat fields, top-dressed more than 55,000 mu of corn, hoed the second time on more than 40,000 mu of millet fields, and replanted 12,000 mu.

    武乡县委发动干部群众修订社章
    运用高级社示范章程调整社内关系
    本报讯　中共山西省武乡县委员会正组织全县农业生产合作社学习“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”，并积极领导修订社章的工作。
    武乡县在高级合作化以后，曾出现了社干部和社员思想不一致、社内关系不正常的现象。有的干部只关心社的集体利益，不关心社员的疾苦；有的社只顾农业生产，放弃了多种经营。社员反映：“把活水堵了口，变成了死水，一个零花钱也没有！”有的社干部作风不好，甚至自私自利，闹本位主义，闹不团结。在社员中，也有一部分人只顾个人利益，不好好参加社内劳动，不爱护公共财产。有些社财务制度不健全，生产资料公有化的价格不合理，社员意见纷纭。
    在“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”公布以后，武乡县委认真进行了学习讨论，认识到这是一个极其重要的文件，应该以它作为标准解决合作社内现存的一些重要问题。首先，以县委委员为首，组织各部部长、副部长、副县长、农林局长等五十五个报告员进行了集体学习；同时，拟订了向基层干部传授的提纲和向农民群众报告的内容。接着，报告员们分赴全县二百一十个农业生产合作社，大张旗鼓地进行了报告和宣传。全县六千四百个宣传员，也在各级党组织领导下进行了系统的学习，然后用各种形式广泛展开了宣传活动，并组织群众讨论。到目前为止，全县二百一十个社的五万六千九百多个社员中，受到社章教育的已达五万二千九百多人，占社员总数的93％以上。
    学习社章以后，基层干部和一些社员对照自己的思想作了检查。南坪农业社干部在学习以后，克服了忽视领导社员开展副业生产的倾向，修订了生产计划，决定把前半年少收入的在后半年补起来。马村和甘草背的社员，克服了互相怀疑的思想，决心今后团结生产。
    各农业社在宣传社章以后，普遍发动社员，按照社章的精神，针对社内当前存在的问题，修订了原来的社章。有些社根据高级社示范章程中规定的分配原则，进行了全年分配试算。各社普遍根据高级社示范章程第三十三条修订本社社章，实行了超产奖励制，按照第四十一条建立和健全了财务制度。有些社按照高级社示范章程解决了生产资料入社价格不合理、没规定偿还期限等问题。现在，全县二百一十个农业社的修订社章工作已经全部完成。
    宣传和修订社章以后，社内关系作了初步的调整，社员思想水平也普遍提高，大大推动了当前生产。全县二百一十个农业社已翻麦田五万六千多亩，玉米追肥五万五千多亩，谷田锄第二遍的已有四万多亩，复播一万二千多亩。
