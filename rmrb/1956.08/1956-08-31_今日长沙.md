    Today's Changsha
    He Gengsheng
    Changsha is the political, economic, and cultural center of Hunan Province. The city has convenient land and water transportation, with the Yuehan Railway running through it from north to south, and the Xiang River flowing through the urban area. From here, several major highways extend into the granary of the country – the Dongting Lake area – and the remote mountainous areas of western and southern Hunan. Ships departing from Changsha can reach important ports along the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers, and can also pass through the vast Dongting Lake and directly enter the Yangtze River. Changsha is also a hub for the concentration and transshipment of agricultural and industrial products in Hunan Province. It was once one of China's four major rice markets and the origin of the well-known Xiang embroidery.
    Changsha is a city deeply influenced by the revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong engaged in revolutionary activities here in 1917. On the picturesque Yuelu Mountain, across the Xiang River, is the famous Aiwan Pavilion, a place where Comrade Mao Zedong often studied and rested in his youth; at the foot of the mountain are the ruins of Yuelu Academy, one of the four great academies in Chinese history, where Comrade Mao Zedong lived before 1921. The New People's Study Society, initiated and organized by Comrade Mao Zedong, which later had a great influence on the Chinese revolution, was also founded at the foot of Yuelu Mountain in 1917. In Qingshuitang, in the eastern part of the city, there is a house where Comrade Mao Zedong lived while carrying out revolutionary activities in Changsha. He ran a self-study university there, training many outstanding cadres for the Chinese revolution.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this city experienced countless disasters. Since the bloody "May 21st Incident" in 1927, many revolutionary martyrs shed their blood in Changsha. The people of Changsha had been subjected to the slaughter and persecution of the reactionaries. In 1938, the reactionary government, under the pretext of scorched-earth resistance, cruelly set a fire that destroyed this famous city with more than 2,000 years of history, which is known as the "Changsha Fire" both at home and abroad.
    When Changsha returned to the embrace of the people in August 1949, it was a scene of ruins everywhere. 80% of the houses were temporary structures built of wooden boards and thatched roofs. There were only three streets called "roads" in the city center, two of which were unfinished. There was no tap water in the city, and residents drew drinking water from the Xiang River at wharves with sewage and drainage outlets. Urban water and land transportation could only be maintained by backward rickshaws and wooden boats. The city's sewers were blocked, and sewage overflowed during heavy rains, creating a foul stench. The originally weak medium and small-sized industries, which could only produce some consumer goods, were also in a state of depression under the severe sabotage of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    After liberation, this dilapidated city has gradually changed its face with the development of the national economic construction. With the hands of the workers, old factories have been revived, and new factories have been established. The Changsha Machine Tool Factory, expanded after liberation, can now produce new machine tools according to Soviet blueprints. The Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Changsha Machinery Factory are also producing new agricultural machinery such as double-wheel double-share plows, threshers, and water pumps in large quantities. In recent years, Changsha has also built factories for porcelain, pharmaceuticals, enamel, glass, and weaving. A modern meat joint processing plant has also been completed, with a production capacity of processing 1,000 pigs per day. According to statistics at the end of 1955, the total industrial output value of Changsha increased by 428% compared with 1950. Highway and shipping industries have also developed rapidly in these years. On the water and land transportation lines of Hunan Province, ships, cars, and trains transport industrial products from Changsha to the countryside and agricultural products from the countryside to Changsha every day.
    This year, the people of Changsha have again greeted the upsurge of socialist transformation in the city with joy and excitement. More than 600 private industrial enterprises and more than 4,000 private commercial enterprises have implemented joint state-private ownership in the entire industry, and some have even directly become part of state-owned enterprises. More than 9,000 handicraftsmen have implemented cooperativization in the entire industry. Farmers in the suburbs have also actively participated in agricultural production cooperatives. Now many agricultural production cooperatives have been transferred to advanced agricultural cooperatives.
    In the urban and suburban areas, new buildings can be seen constantly erected. In the past six years, the area of ​​newly built houses is one-third of the original area of ​​the city. The workers who used to live in low sheds have now moved in batches to new houses with red walls and red tiles, which are clean and bright. On the bank of the Xiang River, Xiahe Street, which used to be muddy and crowded with shacks, has now become a flat, clean riverside avenue lined with green trees. From the East Railway Station through the city center to the ferry terminal, new buildings are constantly completed on both sides of the wide May 1st asphalt road, with a long green hedge in the middle of the road, and a wide May 1st Square in its center. In these years, the total length of roads built in the city is 20 kilometers, exceeding the total number of roads built in the more than 30 years of reactionary rule. While building roads, the city has built and renovated 65 kilometers of sewers. The tap water project, which the Kuomintang reactionary government shouted for more than 30 years, defrauded citizens of a lot of money, and failed to complete, was completed by the People's Government as early as 1951.
    The cultural, educational, and health undertakings in Changsha are also developing rapidly. In the past, there was only one university under Yuelu Mountain, with a maximum of more than 2,000 students. Now there are three specialized schools (a total of five in the city), with more than 6,000 students. The number of hospitals with relatively complete equipment has also increased from four before liberation to eleven. Before liberation, Changsha only had a simple Tianxin Park. Now there are three parks – Martyrs Park, Tianxin Park, and Children's Park. Yuelu Mountain on the opposite bank of the Xiang River has been built into a scenic cultural and sanatorium area. The Workers' Cultural Palace with rich content has long been built on the site of the Zuo Zongtang Temple left over from the Qing Dynasty—the land destroyed into ruins during the War of Resistance. The boat people who used to live a floating life on the water now also have their own cultural palace on the beautiful Shuiluzhou. (Attached picture)

    今日长沙
    何根生
    长沙市是湖南省政治、经济、文化的中心。全市水陆交通便利，粤汉路横贯南北，湘江流经市区。从这里有几条公路干线深入祖国的粮仓——洞庭湖区和偏远的湘西、湘南山区。从长沙开航的船只，可以到达湘、资、沅、澧四水的重要口岸，也可以穿过广阔的洞庭湖，直入长江。长沙市也是湖南省农产品和工业品集中和转运的枢纽。这里过去是中国四大米市之一，也是中外驰名的湘绣产地。
    长沙市是受过深厚革命影响的城市。毛泽东同志1917年就在这里从事革命活动。在湘江对岸风景秀丽的岳麓山上，有个著名的爱晚亭，那是毛泽东同志青年时代经常去读书和游息的地方；山下还有中国历史上四大书院之一的岳麓书院的遗迹，1921年以前，毛泽东同志曾在这里住过。由毛泽东同志发起组织的、后来对中国革命有极大影响的新民学会，也是1917年在岳麓山下成立的。市区东端的清水塘，有毛泽东同志早期在长沙进行革命活动住过的房子，他在那里曾办过自修大学，为中国革命培养了很多优秀的干部。
    在国民党反动统治时期，这座城市经历了无数次灾难，自1927年血腥的“马日事变”以后，有许多革命烈士在长沙洒下了鲜血。长沙市人民一直受着反动派的残杀和迫害。1938年，反动政府借口焦土抗战，残忍地放了一把大火，烧毁了这座有两千多年历史的名城，这就是中外皆知的“长沙大火”。
    当1949年8月，长沙重回人民怀抱的时候，到处是瓦砾场。房屋有80％是用木板、茅草搭的临时建筑，市中心区被称为“马路”的只有三条，其中有两条还是有头无尾，没有全部筑成。市内没有自来水，市民饮水是从有粪便码头和阴沟出口处的湘江上挑取的。市区的水陆交通，只能靠落后的人力车和木划来维持。市内的下水道淤塞不通，大雨时污水四溢，臭气熏天。基础原来就很薄弱的、只能生产一些消费品的中小工业，在国民党反动派严重的破坏下，也是一片萧条景象。
    解放以后，这座残破不堪的城市，随着国家经济建设的发展已逐步改变了她的面貌。靠着工人们的双手，旧的工厂复兴了，新的工厂也建立起来了。解放后扩建的长沙机床厂已能按苏联图纸生产新式机床。湖南农业机械厂和长沙机械厂，也正在大批地生产双轮双铧犁、打稻机和抽水机等新式农业机械。最近几年，长沙还兴建了瓷器、制药、搪瓷、玻璃、织布等工厂。一座现代化的肉类联合加工厂，也已经建成，它的生产能力每天可以加工一千头生猪。据1955年年底统计，长沙市工业总产值比1950年提高428％。公路和航运事业，在这几年内也有飞跃的发展，在湖南省的水陆交通线上，每天都有轮船、汽车、火车把工业品从长沙运到乡下去，把农村的农产品运到长沙来。
    今年，长沙市人民又以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接了全市社会主义改造的高潮——六百多户私营工业和四千多户私营商业，已经实行了全行业的公私合营，有的还直接成为国营企业的一个部分。九千多户手工业者实行了全行业的合作化。郊区农民也都积极地参加了农业生产合作社。现在很多农业生产合作社都转入了高级农业社。
    在市区和郊区，到处都可以看到新的建筑物不断矗立起来。六年多来，新建房屋的面积为市区原有房屋面积的三分之一。过去住在低矮的棚子里的工人们，现在已经成批地迁居到红墙红瓦、清洁爽亮的新住宅里去。在湘江边上，过去是泥泞载道，茅棚拥塞的小河街，现在已成为平坦干净、绿树成荫的沿江大道了。从火车东站经市中心到轮渡码头，宽阔的五一柏油大马路的两旁，新的大厦不断落成，马路中间有一条漫长的绿篱，它的中心还有一个宽阔的五一广场。这几年，市内兴建的道路全长二十公里，超过了反动派统治时期三十多年所建筑的道路的总数。在兴建道路的同时，全市兴修与改建了六十五公里的下水道。国民党反动政府叫喊三十多年，骗取了市民大量金钱而没有建成的自来水工程，人民政府早在1951年就建成了。
    长沙市的文教卫生事业也在飞速发展，过去岳麓山下只有一所大学，学生最多时只有两千多人，如今已有三所专业学校（全市共有五所），有六千多学生。设备较完善的医院也从解放前的四所增加到十一所。解放前长沙市只有一个简陋的天心公园，现在已有三座公园——烈士公园、天心公园、儿童公园。湘江对岸的岳麓山，已被建设成一个风景秀丽的文化区和疗养区。在清代遗留下来的左宗棠祠——抗战时被毁为废墟的土地上，一座内容丰富的工人文化宫早就建成了。过去过着水上流动生活的船民们，现在在风景优美的水陆洲上，也有了自己的文化宫。（附图片）
