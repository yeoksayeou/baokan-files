Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter on August 21st to Ambassador G. Parthasarathi, Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, emphasizing that the South Vietnamese authorities must inherit the obligations borne by the French government and continue to implement the Geneva Accords.

Vo Nguyen Giap's letter was written after receiving a letter dated August 11th from French Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henri Hoppenot, and a copy of the French government's note to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 25th. These documents state that the South Vietnamese authorities continue to believe that they have no responsibility to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords or to inherit the French government's obligation to implement these accords. The documents also state that arrangements have been made between the French government and the South Vietnamese administration regarding the joint organizations of the two sides of the Vietnam ceasefire and the liaison delegations to the International Commission.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the opinions of the French government and the South Vietnamese administration, as well as the arrangements reached between them, are inconsistent with the Geneva Accords and the proposals made by the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8th of this year. He said that the French government is a signatory to the Geneva Accords. As long as the French government has not, in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the recommendations of the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, transferred its responsibility for implementing the Geneva Accords to the South Vietnamese administration, it must continue to assume its obligations under the Geneva Accords and maintain the status quo in order to ensure the normal activities of the International Commission and joint organizations. The French government cannot, as it declared in its letter of August 11th, consider itself "no longer having any direct or special responsibility" for the Geneva Accords.

Vo Nguyen Giap then elaborated on the views of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as follows:

	I. The parties concerned must continue and guarantee the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in accordance with the recommendations of the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8th.

	II. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that, according to law, according to facts, and according to custom, the South Vietnamese administration is fully bound by the Geneva Accords and must therefore inherit from the French government the continuation of the implementation of these accords.

	The South Vietnamese administration must notify the two Co-Chairmen when it intends to start holding the consultative conferences stipulated in the Geneva Accords, and when it intends to hold free general elections to reunify Vietnam.

	III. In accordance with the recommendations of the two Co-Chairmen on May 8th, the French government has a responsibility to arrange with the South Vietnamese administration for the succession of work to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. As long as this succession has not been realized, the French government, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, has a responsibility to maintain the status quo.

	IV. The International Commission and the organizations responsible for implementing the Geneva Accords must be enabled to continue their normal activities on the legal basis of the Geneva Accords.

In his letter, Vo Nguyen Giap also addressed the issue of the South Vietnamese administration's liaison delegation replacing the French liaison delegation to the International Commission. He said that the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army believes that the South Vietnamese liaison delegation must fully assume the responsibilities that have been borne by the French liaison delegation to date. This is the only way to guarantee the "normal activities of the International Commission" desired by the two Co-Chairmen.

General Vo Nguyen Giap finally requested the International Commission to take the necessary measures to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and the recommendations of the two Co-Chairmen on May 8th, and to notify the two Co-Chairmen of the above situation.

### 武元甲将军写信给越南国际委员会主席  法国南越必须继续执行日内瓦协定

    武元甲将军写信给越南国际委员会主席
    法国南越必须继续执行日内瓦协定
    新华社河内24日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在八月二十一日写给越南国际监督和监察委员会主席格·帕塔萨拉蒂大使一封信，强调说明南越当局必须继承法国政府所负担的义务，继续执行日内瓦协定。
    武元甲这封信是在收到法国驻南越大使亨利·奥培诺八月十一日的信件和法国政府七月二十五日致日内瓦会议的两位主席的照会的副本以后写的。这些文件说明，南越当局继续认为它自己没有责任保证日内瓦协定的执行和继承法国政府担负执行这些协定的义务。文件还说，法国政府和南越行政当局之间已经就有关越南停战双方的联合组织和驻国际委员会联络代表团的问题作出了安排。
    武元甲指出，法国政府和南越行政当局的意见以及它们之间所达成的安排，是和日内瓦协定以及日内瓦会议两位主席今年五月八日的建议不相符合的。他说，法国政府是日内瓦协定的签字者。只要法国政府还没有根据日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议两位主席的建议把它在执行日内瓦协定方面所负担的责任移交给南越行政当局，它就必须继续承担它对日内瓦协定所承担的义务和维持现状，以便保证国际委员会和联合组织的正常活动。法国政府不能像它在八月十一日的信中所宣布的那样认为自己对日内瓦协定“不再负有任何不论是直接的或是特殊的责任了”。
    武元甲接着详细说明越南民主共和国方面的看法如下：
    一、有关方面必须根据日内瓦会议两位主席五月八日的建议继续和保证充分执行日内瓦协定。
    二、越南民主共和国政府认为，根据法律、根据事实和根据惯例，南越行政当局完全受日内瓦协定的约束，因此，必须继承法国政府来继续执行这些协定。
    南越行政当局必须通知两位主席它打算在什么时候开始举行日内瓦协定规定的协商会议，和它打算在什么时候举行自由普选以重新统一越南。
    三、根据两位主席五月八日的建议，法国政府有责任同南越行政当局安排保证日内瓦协定彻底执行的继承工作。只要这种继承工作没有实现，法国政府作为日内瓦协定的一个签字者，就有责任维持现状。
    四、必须使国际委员会和负责执行日内瓦协定的各组织能够继续在日内瓦协定的法律基础上进行它们的正常活动。
    武元甲在信中还谈到南越行政当局的联络代表团代替法国驻国际委员会的联络代表团的问题。他说，越南人民军总司令部认为，南越联络代表团必须完全承担到目前为止由法国联络代表团担负的责任。这是保证两位主席所希望的“国际委员会正常活动”的唯一办法。
    武元甲将军最后要求国际委员会采取必要措施保证继续执行日内瓦协定和两位主席五月八日的建议，并且把上述情况通知两位主席。
