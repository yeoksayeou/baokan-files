Some Different Views on the "Three Great Mountains" of Peking Opera
He De

In his article "Some Thoughts on the 'Three Great Mountains' of Peking Opera" (see "People's Daily," July 29), Comrade Wu Zuguang made the following evaluation of "Three Great Mountains": As a general play, Comrade Wu Zuguang affirmed "Three Great Mountains," praising its "very good theatrical effect," with performances that were "very sincere and moving," and a performance that was "reasonable, justified, and vivid"... However, when considering "Three Great Mountains" as Peking Opera, Comrade Wu Zuguang basically negated it, saying: "Through the performance of 'Three Great Mountains'..., can we consider it as opening the way for the 'Central Experimental Opera Troupe,' the 'Central Song and Dance Troupe'..., to create our national new opera and new dance drama?" This is a very euphemistic negation.

Comrade Wu Zuguang believes that the reason "Three Great Mountains" "doesn't resemble Peking Opera" is mainly because: "...Peking Opera has its own set of traditional performance methods. It can use eight 'extras' to represent thousands of troops and horses, it can use three or five people to represent large crowds, and it can use special costumes, makeup, and special percussion sounds to highlight the main characters. Now, because 'Three Great Mountains' uses realistic scenery, and in order to coordinate with the style of the scenery, the above-mentioned customary Peking Opera performance methods cannot be used at all. Many scenes, especially the opening and ending scenes of mass song and dance, are completely scenes from spoken drama or new song and dance drama, and have nothing in common with the Peking Opera that the general audience is familiar with."

Comrade Wu Zuguang's opinion has its correct side, pointing out that "Three Great Mountains" has not fully utilized and developed the traditional Peking Opera performance methods and techniques. This shortcoming exists in "Three Great Mountains." However, at the same time, I also believe that Comrade Wu Zuguang's opinion has a great deal of one-sidedness, and this one-sidedness arises from a too narrow understanding of the performance methods of Peking Opera. Can we deny that "Three Great Mountains" is Peking Opera simply because it does not use eight "extras" to represent thousands of troops and horses, or three or five people to represent large crowds...? No, we cannot. The performance methods of Peking Opera are far more than that; they are very rich and diverse. Although "Three Great Mountains" has the flaw of being stylistically inconsistent, the vast majority of percussion sounds and singing melodies here are Peking Opera; the performances in important scenes (such as the Wangfu arrest scene praised by Comrade Wu Zuguang) are also Peking Opera; the dialogue mixes Beijing colloquialisms and rhyming prose, and although it is not used harmoniously enough, especially the use of rhyming prose, leaving room for discussion, it cannot be said that it is not Peking Opera; speaking of fighting, Comrade Wu Zuguang also believes that it "fully utilizes and enriches the advantages of Peking Opera martial arts techniques." Looking at singing, acting, dialogue, and fighting, "Three Great Mountains" has made every effort to use the customary performance methods of Peking Opera. It is different from certain crude reforms of the "spoken drama plus singing" type that completely ignore the characteristics of traditional opera. Therefore, we should affirm that it is Peking Opera. Comrade Wu Zuguang said it "doesn't resemble Peking Opera," which I think is an inappropriate conclusion drawn by exaggerating some of its stylistically inconsistent shortcomings.

In fact, it is difficult for us to demand that "Three Great Mountains" be performed entirely according to the old ways, and it is also difficult to demand that "Three Great Mountains" include all kinds of Peking Opera performance methods without omission (even in old plays, no such example can be found). This is impossible. "Three Great Mountains" abandoned some inherent performance methods of Peking Opera (such as: using "extras" to represent thousands of troops and horses, etc.), while also absorbing some new performance methods (such as: realistic scenery, Mongolian mass song and dance scenes, etc.). This is in line with the requirements of the subject matter; it is not only possible but also necessary. Take "three-dimensional scenery" for example; although it has the shortcoming of not being simple enough, it creates a very good atmosphere for the play, especially in the Wangfu scenes. The atmosphere created by the scenery strengthens the play's persuasiveness. We cannot imagine what effect "Three Great Mountains" would have if it were performed without scenery in the "old way."

As a new attempt, "Three Great Mountains" inevitably has some inappropriate aspects in its additions and deletions (the so-called "deletion" means: certain performance methods are not used in this play, but can still be used in another play; "deletion" is not equal to abolition). However, we cannot deny the necessity of such additions and deletions because there are shortcomings, and even less can we expel it from the scope of Peking Opera because of certain additions and deletions.

Viewing the performance methods of Peking Opera as too rigid can only scare away and block various creative attempts of Peking Opera, preventing it from enriching its own means of expression to adapt to the needs of newer and broader subject matter.

In fact, the development of Peking Opera and the richness of Peking Opera itself negate this view of seeing its performance methods as too narrow and too rigid. In Peking Opera, there are plays like "Second Entry to the Palace" (emphasizing singing), as well as plays like "San Cha Kou" (emphasizing fighting) and "Four Scholars" (emphasizing acting). It possesses a wide variety of performance styles. From a musical point of view, "Little Shepherdess" originated from folk songs, and "Broken Bridge" and "Qi Shuang Hui" originated from Kunqu opera. Their musical styles are different from Xipi and Erhuang melodies, but no one objects to them being performed on the Peking Opera stage. As for the performance treatment of "Three Great Mountains," as a new play in Peking Opera, as a novel style (it has absorbed some performance methods of new opera), I don't think it should be rejected; it has every reason to exist.

Comrade Wu Zuguang, on the one hand, is dissatisfied with "Three Great Mountains" being changed too much, "not resembling Peking Opera," and on the other hand, believes that "Three Great Mountains" is bound by the "traditional concept of 'Peking Opera'" and has not been reformed "boldly enough." Comrade Wu Zuguang pointed out a direction of effort for plays like "Three Great Mountains": that is, to "not be restricted by the term 'Peking Opera'" and to carry out "bolder creation." In this way, it "will no longer be said by the audience to 'not resemble Peking Opera,' or any other kind of opera; because what we are performing is fundamentally not 'Peking Opera,' and our path is wider than Peking Opera. The question of 'resembling or not resembling Peking Opera' will not be within our consideration." This idea is a very "thorough" idea, but also a very peculiar idea: either don't change it at all, or once you change it, it "doesn't resemble Peking Opera"; or change it completely, kicking aside the inherent style characteristics of the opera genre. -- We can only draw such a conclusion from Comrade Wu Zuguang's "thoughts." And this conclusion is harmful. If everyone follows Comrade Wu Zuguang's advice, then in the future there will be neither Peking Opera nor Sichuan Opera, Hunan Opera, Yue Opera, Ping Opera..., but only a so-called "national new song and dance drama." This runs counter to the "let a hundred flowers bloom" policy of opera reform.

### 对京剧“三座山”的一些不同的看法

    对京剧“三座山”的一些不同的看法
    何德
    吴祖光同志在“对京剧‘三座山’的一些想法”一文（见七月二十九日“人民日报”）中，对“三座山”作了这样的评价：“三座山”作为一般的戏，吴祖光同志是肯定它的，他称赞了它的“剧场效果很好”，表演有“很诚挚动人”之处，演出是“合情合理，有声有色”的……；但是，把“三座山”作为京剧看，吴祖光同志基本上却是否定它的，他说：“通过‘三座山’……的演出，我们是否可以认为是替‘中央实验歌剧院’、‘中央歌舞团’……为创造我们民族的新歌剧和新舞剧打开了道路？”这是一个很委婉的否定。
    吴祖光同志认为“三座山”所以“不像京剧”，主要理由是：“……京剧有它一套传统的表演方法。它可以用八个‘龙套’来代表千军万马，它可以用三、五个人代表大批群众，它可以用特殊的服装化装及特殊的锣鼓音响来突出主要的角色。现在由于‘三座山’采用了现实的布景，为了和布景的风格协调，以上的一些京剧惯用的表演方法便完全使用不上。很多场面，特别显著的是开头和结尾的两场群众歌舞的场面，那完全是话剧或新歌舞剧的场面，和一般观众所熟悉的京剧毫无共通之处。”
    吴祖光同志的这一意见有它正确的一面，它指出“三座山”还没有充分地运用和发挥京剧传统的表现方法和表现技巧。这个缺点在“三座山”中是存在的。但，同时我又认为吴祖光同志的这一意见带有很大的片面性，这种片面性，是由于对京剧的表现方法了解得太狭隘而产生的。我们能不能因为“三座山”不用八个“龙套”表现千军万马、不用三、五个人表现大批群众……就否认它是京剧呢？不能。京剧的表现方法何止于此，它是非常丰富多样的。尽管“三座山”有风格不够统一的毛病，但，这里的极大部分锣鼓音响和唱腔是京剧的；重要场面的表演（如吴祖光同志所称道的王府就缚一场的表演）也是京剧的；念白方面杂用京白和韵白，虽然用得不够谐调，特别是韵白的运用，留有讨论的余地，但也不能说它不是京剧的；谈到开打，吴祖光同志也认为它“充分发挥了丰富了京剧武打技术的优点”。从唱、做、念、打各方面来看，“三座山”都尽可能地运用了京剧惯用的表现方法，它和某些“话剧加唱”式的非常忽视戏曲特点的粗暴的改革是不同的，因此，我们应该肯定它是京剧。吴祖光同志说它“不像京剧”，我以为是把它的某些风格不协调的缺点夸大起来而得出的不恰当的结论。
    事实上我们很难要求“三座山”完全按照老路子来演，也很难要求“三座山”把京剧的各种表现方法都包罗无遗（即使在老戏中也找不出这样的例子），这是办不到的事。“三座山”舍弃了京剧的某些固有的表现方法（如：以“龙套”代表千军万马，等），而又吸取了一些新的表现方法（如：写实的布景、蒙古的群众歌舞场面等），这是符合题材的要求的，这不仅是可以的，而且也是必要的。就以“立体布景”来说，它虽然有不够简炼的缺点，但它给戏创造了很好的气氛，特别是王府几场戏，布景所造成的气氛，加强了戏的说服力。我们不能设想“三座山”不用布景而在“守旧”前演出会得到什么样的效果。
    作为一个新尝试的“三座山”，在增和删（所谓“删”是指：某些表现方法在这个戏中没有用到，在另一个戏中还是可以用得到的；“删”不等于废除）之中，有不妥善的地方，这也是难免的。但，不能因为有缺点而否认这种增删的必要性，更不能因为有了某些增删而把它开除出京剧的范围。
    把京剧的表现方法看得过于凝固，只能吓退和堵塞京剧的各种创造性的尝试，不让它丰富自己的表现手段，以适应更新鲜更广阔的题材的需要。
    实际上，京剧的发展、京剧本身的丰富性就否定了这种把它的表现方法看得过于狭隘、过于凝固的观点。在京剧中，既有“二进宫”（重唱）这样的戏，也有“三岔口”（重打）、“四进士”（重做）这样的戏。它拥有多种多样的表现风格。从音乐风格上来讲，像“小放牛”来源于民歌，“断桥”、“奇双会”来源于昆腔，它们都和西皮二黄的音乐风格不一样，但也没有人反对它在京剧舞台上演出。至于“三座山”这样的演出处理，作为京剧中的一个新剧目，作为一种新颖的风格（它吸取了新歌剧的一些表现方法），我认为不应该加以排斥，它完全有理由存在。
    吴祖光同志一方面不满意“三座山”改得太多，“不像京剧”，另一方面又认为“三座山”受了“‘京剧’这个传统的概念束缚”，改革得还“不够大胆”。吴祖光同志给“三座山”这一类戏指出了一个努力方向：就是“不受‘京剧’这个名词的拘束”，进行“更大胆的创造”。这样一来，就“不会再被观众说是‘不像京剧’，或别的什么剧；因为我们演出的根本不是
  ‘京剧’，我们的道路比京剧更宽。
  ‘像不像京剧’的问题将不在我们的考虑之内”。这种想法，是一种非常“彻底”的想法，然而也是一种很奇特的想法：要末一点也不要改，改一改就“不像京剧”；要末彻底地改，把剧种固有的风格特点一脚踢开。——我们从吴祖光同志的“想法”里只能得出这样的结论。而这个结论是有害的。如果大家都照着吴祖光同志的意见去做，那么将来既没有京剧，也没有川剧、湘剧、越剧、评剧……了，而只有一种所谓“民族的新歌舞剧”。这和“百花齐放”的戏曲改革方针，是背道而驰的。
