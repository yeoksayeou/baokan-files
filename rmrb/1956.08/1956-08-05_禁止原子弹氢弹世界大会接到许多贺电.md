Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 3rd: As of today, Japan has received twenty congratulatory messages from various countries for the upcoming Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

    Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure said in his congratulatory message that he believes banning atomic and hydrogen bombs is necessary and possible. He said we must intensify efforts to implement a universal disarmament agreement. Faure hoped that the first step towards achieving universal disarmament would be to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    British philosopher Bertrand Russell expressed his agreement with the ideals of the World Conference organizers. He also expressed his regret that he could not attend the conference.

    Other world-renowned figures who have expressed congratulations to the World Conference include Professor John Desmond Bernal, Vice-President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, and Rameshwari Nehru, Chairperson of the Asian Solidarity Committee of India.

    The World Conference will be held in Tokyo and Nagasaki from August 6th onwards. According to Agence France-Presse, there will be 2,000 Japanese representatives participating in the Tokyo conference, and the number of representatives participating in the Nagasaki conference from August 9th to 11th will increase to 3,000. More than 70 foreign representatives from 20 countries will also attend the conference.

    The preparatory body of the World Conference expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's obstructive attitude towards representatives from some countries. On the afternoon of August 2nd, it sent representatives to visit Minister of Justice Ryozo Makino, requesting that representatives from Democratic Republic of Germany, Mongolian People's Republic, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Democratic Republic of Vietnam be allowed to enter the country.

    Makino Ryozo rejected this request, stating that the Japanese government will continue to implement its policy of not allowing these representatives to enter the country.
