Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 5th: The Mandalay "People's Daily" published an editorial on August 3rd stating that the Burmese and Chinese governments and people must strengthen their vigilance and pay attention to the conspiracies of imperialism to undermine Sino-Burmese friendship.

The editorial, entitled "On Sino-Burmese Friendship," said that because Burma and China have declared the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, those who attempt to undermine Sino-Burmese friendship are using the undelimited border between the two countries and the issue of overseas Chinese to conspire to provoke relations between the two countries.

The editorial believes that rumors about the so-called "Chinese troops invading Burmese territory" must be stopped. The Burmese government should clarify the reasons for the rumors.

    缅甸“人民报”发表评论
    警惕帝国主义破坏缅中友谊的阴谋
    新华社仰光5日电　曼德勒“人民报”八月三日发表社论说，缅中两国政府和人民必须加强警惕，注视帝国主义破坏缅中友谊的阴谋活动。
    这篇题为“论缅中友好”的社论说，由于缅中两国宣布了和平共处的五项原则，那些企图破坏缅中友谊的人就利用两国的未定界和华侨问题，阴谋挑拨两国的关系。
    社论认为，关于所谓“中国军队侵入缅境”的谣传必须加以制止。缅甸政府应该澄清发生谣传的原因。
