    Telegrams Aren't as Fast as Trains
    Shi Liuming
    On July 23rd at noon, a train from Xi'an arrived at Lanzhou East Station, and more than 1,300 members of the Henan Voluntary Reclamation Team stepped off the train.
    Also on July 23rd at noon, a deliveryman from the Lanzhou East Station Telegraph Office hurriedly delivered a telegram from Xi'an Station to the Lanzhou East Station passenger office. The telegram said to prepare a day's worth of dry rations for the Henan Voluntary Reclamation Team.
    The people arrived, but the telegram only arrived then, so there was no time to prepare dry rations.
    The fact that telegrams are slower than trains is certainly an accidental event and should not be regarded as the norm, but similar "accidental events" of this nature are not uncommon in all walks of life. For example, sometimes long-distance buses run like ox carts, airmail is slower than regular mail, and machine operations are less efficient than manual operations. It seems unreasonable, but it is indeed the case. Sometimes this is due to irresistible objective reasons, such as bad weather preventing planes from taking off on time; but many times it is due to irresponsibility. It can be seen that although modern tools are good, if they are placed in the hands of people with a weak sense of responsibility, they are sometimes not as good as backward tools.

    电报没有火车快
    石六鸣
    七月二十三日中午，一列从西安开出的火车到达兰州东站，一千三百多名河南志愿垦荒队的队员走下车来。
    也是七月二十三日中午，兰州东站电报所的一位送报员，匆匆忙忙地把一份从西安车站发来的电报送到兰州东站客运室，电报上说要为河南志愿垦荒队准备一天的干粮。
    人到了，电报才到，当然来不及准备干粮。
    电报速度不如火车固然是偶然事件，不能视为常例，但类似这种性质的“偶然事件”在各行各业中并不少见。比如有时长途汽车跑得像牛车，航空信比平信还慢，机器操作不如手工操作效率高，看来似乎都不合情理，然而却确有其事。这中间有时是由于不可抗拒的客观原因，如气候不好飞机不能按时起飞；但很多时候是由于不负责任。可见现代化的工具虽然好，但要是放在工作责任心不强的人手中，有时还比不上落后工具。
