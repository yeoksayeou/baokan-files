    Guaranteeing the Livelihood of the Families of Martyrs and Servicemen

    On the occasion of commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, we think with deep gratitude of the People's Liberation Army troops who bravely and diligently defend the national defense, and also of the revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families who have endured many hardships for the country and the people and inspired the fighting spirit of their loved ones.

    Revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families have made great contributions to the country and the people, and the country and the people reciprocate with due care and consideration. In order to solve the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families lacking labor and to guarantee their livelihoods, the state has spent a large amount of preferential treatment funds every year to subsidize them. In rural areas, land cultivation on their behalf has been widely implemented. Since last year and this year, with the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, various places have implemented the method of preferential workdays for revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families. From the areas where it has been implemented, the method of preferential workdays is feasible. The livelihoods of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families have been guaranteed, the members of the cooperative have not increased their burden, and it has further improved the production enthusiasm of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, eliminating some of the complicated procedures in the past land cultivation work.

    However, things are not always perfect. There are still many problems in the preferential treatment work in many places. For example, although some agricultural production cooperatives have implemented the method of preferential workdays for revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, the preferential treatment is very little, because they have assessed the number of workdays that revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen' families can do themselves too much. For example, they assess that a 70-year-old person should do more than 80 workdays a year; they calculate the time when the daughters of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families return to their parents' home and when students return home during holidays as self-done workdays; and some also regard the non-fixed income of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families as fixed income. As a result, the preferential workdays enjoyed by revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families are reduced, and their lives cannot be effectively guaranteed. The state's preferential treatment policy stipulates that the preferential treatment for revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families must ensure that their living standards are not lower than the living standards of the general local masses, and this cannot be achieved. We hope that places where this kind of situation occurs will make some adjustments based on the actual situation and in a realistic manner when inspecting the preferential treatment work.

    There are also some places that have not implemented the method of preferential workdays until now, because some grass-roots cadres have concerns about promoting the method of preferential workdays. One of the concerns is that they are afraid of increasing the burden on the masses. This concern is unnecessary. In fact, the burden of preferential workdays on the masses is not a newly added burden, but a change in the form of land cultivation on their behalf; it is not only not a newly added burden, but judging from the results of the implementation of this method in some places, it has reduced the burden on the masses compared to the period of land cultivation on their behalf. For example, in Ji County, Hebei Province, in 1955, each person who bore the duty of land cultivation on their behalf bore three obligatory land cultivation workdays, and the state had to subsidize the county with 150,000 yuan for land cultivation adjustment funds. After the implementation of the method of preferential workdays in 1956, each person's burden was only equal to 1% of the number of workdays they did themselves (the strongest labor force can do 220 workdays a year, bearing 2.2 workdays, and the general labor force can do 150 workdays a year, bearing 1.5 workdays). The burden on the masses has been reduced compared to the past, and the state subsidy has also been reduced to 43,000 yuan. This example can prove that the first concern is superfluous. The second concern is that they are worried that the implementation of this method will affect the realization of the slogan of "90% of the members of the agricultural production cooperative increasing their income." This concern is also unreasonable. Since it is not a newly added burden on the masses, it will certainly not affect the increase in income of the members of the cooperative, and revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families should also be included in this 90% of the members, and their income increase should also be guaranteed.

    Of course, we must also consider a special situation, that is, in some old revolutionary base areas, because there are too many revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, the burden on the masses in terms of preferential treatment is indeed much higher than in general areas. Therefore, although the preferential workday system has been implemented, and the masses can voluntarily bear more preferential treatment obligations, the civil affairs departments should make good use of the preferential treatment funds allocated by the state to take appropriate care of places where the burden on the masses is too heavy, and try to achieve a roughly balanced burden on the masses, without being too light or too heavy.

    In terms of using the state's living subsidies for revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, some places are very unconcerned about the current living difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, and withhold the living subsidies allocated by the state too tightly, accumulating them without releasing them, or one-sidedly emphasizing their use to support production, resulting in the living difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families not being resolved. Some of our cadres have a narrow mentality in terms of finance, always thinking that the less money spent, the better, and it is even better not to spend money, pushing it away if they can, and dragging it out if they can, regardless of how much the actual work needs it. Perhaps they think that this approach is saving money and thinking for the country, but it is actually a prejudice. Spending money indiscriminately on things that should not be spent, and spending more on things that should be spent less, is waste; not spending money on things that should be spent, and spending less on things that should be spent more, and the money is accumulated and cannot play its role, is also a waste. All the undertakings, all the work, and all the expenditures of our country are, in the final analysis, for the benefit of the people. The state takes out a sum of money every year to subsidize the lives of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, which is the state's care for revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families, and it is also the embodiment of the state's policy. No one has the right to watch revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families endure difficulties without issuing this payment, or diverting it for other purposes.

    Another problem in the preferential treatment work is that the regular mass preferential treatment activities in some areas have weakened in recent times. This has caused great inconvenience to those single-door, single-household, orphaned, and widowed revolutionary martyrs' families and servicemen's families in their daily lives, such as fetching water, burning firewood, and especially when they are sick, lacking some necessary care. This is a new situation that has occurred after agricultural cooperation. The reason is that the members of the cooperative are very nervous, fearing that they will not have enough work points to eat, and they all want to do more work points for themselves. It is understandable that the masses have this kind of nervousness when they first join the cooperative, and we should not have any blame on the masses. However, district and township cadres should often pay attention to educating the masses on regular preferential treatment work, and pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the preferential treatment groups.

    The preferential treatment work has a history of many years and has played a very important role in the revolutionary struggle; today, when all conditions are incomparably superior to the past, we should of course do the preferential treatment work better. We must make every effort to definitely guarantee that the living standards of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary servicemen's families are not lower than the living standards of the general local masses.

### 保证烈属军属的生活

    保证烈属军属的生活
    在纪念“八一”建军节的时候，我们怀着深切的感激想到那些英勇地辛苦地守卫着国防的人民解放军部队，同时也想到那些为了祖国和人民而忍受过许多艰难困苦、鼓舞了自己亲人斗志的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属。
    革命烈士家属和革命军人家属对国家和人民有很大的贡献，国家和人民也报之以应有的关怀和照顾。为了解决烈属军属缺乏劳动力的困难，保证他们的生活，多少年来，国家每年都支出大笔的优抚事业费，对烈属军属加以补助。在农村，曾经广泛实行过土地代耕。从去年和今年起，随着农业合作化的迅速发展，各地又对烈属军属实行了优待劳动日的办法。从已经实施的地区看，优待劳动日的办法是可行的。烈属军属的生活得到了保障，社员也没有增加什么负担，并且进一步提高了烈属军属的生产积极性，免除了一些过去代耕工作中的繁杂手续。
    可是，事情并不都是圆满的。有不少地方在优抚工作上还有许多问题。比如有的农业生产合作社虽然实行了对烈属军属优待劳动日的办法，但是优待很少，原因是他们把烈属军属自己能做的劳动日数目评定得太多了。例如他们评定七十岁的老人每年自己要做八十多个劳动日；把烈属军属的女儿回娘家和学生放假回家的时间都计算在自做劳动日之内；也有的把烈属军属的非固定收入算作固定收入。这样做的结果，烈属军属享受的优待劳动日就减少了，生活也就得不到确切的保障。国家优抚政策所规定的对烈属军属的优待必须保证他们的生活水平不低于当地一般群众生活水平，这一条就不能实现。我们希望发生这类情况的地方，在检查优抚工作的时候，按照实际情况，实事求是地做些调整。
    还有若干地方，到现在没有实行优待劳动日的办法，原因是有些基层干部对推行优待劳动日的办法有顾虑。顾虑之一，是怕给群众增加负担。这种顾虑是没有必要的。事实上群众优待劳动日的负担不是新增加的负担，而是代耕形式的转变；不仅不是新增加的负担，而且就若干地方实行这一办法的结果来看，倒是比代耕时期使群众减轻了负担。例如河北省蓟县，1955年每一个负担代耕勤务的人负担三个义务代耕工，国家还要补助这个县代耕调剂款十五万元。1956年实行优待劳动日的办法以后，每个人的负担只等于自己所做的劳动日数的1％（最强的劳动力全年可做二百二十个劳动日，负担二点二个劳动日，一般劳动力全年可做一百五十个劳动日，负担一点五个劳动日）。群众的负担比过去减轻了，国家补助也减少到四万三千元。这个例子可以证明第一个顾虑是多余的。顾虑之二，是担心实行这个办法会影响农业生产合作社的“90％社员增加收入”的口号的实现。这种顾虑也是没有道理的。既然不是新增加给群众的负担，当然就不会影响社员增加收入，况且烈属军属也应该包括在这90％的社员以内，也要保证他们的收入增加。
    当然我们也得考虑到一个特殊的情况，就是在有些老革命根据地，由于烈属军属过多，群众在优抚方面的负担确实比一般地区高出很多。因此，虽然实行了优待劳动日制度，群众虽然可以自愿地多担负些优抚的义务，但民政部门却应该很好地利用国家拨付的优抚事业费，对群众负担过多的地方加以适当照顾，尽量做到群众负担大体平衡，而不致畸轻畸重。
    在使用国家对烈属军属的生活补助费方面，有些地方对烈属军属眼前的生活困难很不关心，对国家拨出的烈属军属生活补助费扣得过紧，积压不放，或是片面地强调用来支持生产，结果就使得烈属军属的生活困难不得解决。我们有些干部在财政方面是有一种狭隘心理的，总是认为花钱越少越好，不花钱更好，能推就推，能拖就拖，而不管实际工作多么需要。也许他们认为这种做法就是节约，就是为国家着想，其实是一种偏见。不该花的乱花了，该少花的多花了，这是浪费；该花的不花，该多花的少花，钱被积压下来不能发生作用，同样是一种浪费。我们国家的一切事业，一切工作，一切开支，归根到底，都是为了人民的利益。国家每年拿出一笔钱来补助烈属军属的生活，这是国家对烈属军属的关怀，也是国家的政策的体现，任何人都没有权利眼看着烈属军属忍受困难而不发放这笔款项，或挪作他用。
    优抚工作中的另一个问题，是有些地区经常性的群众性优抚活动在最近一个时期削弱了。这就使得那些单门独户的孤寡烈属和军属，在日常生活中遇到很大的不便，例如吃水、烧柴，特别是生了疾病的时候，缺乏一些必要的照顾。这是农业合作化以后发生的新情况。原因是社员心里很紧张，生怕自己工分少了不够吃，都想多给自己做些工分。群众在初入社的时候有这种紧张心理是可以理解的，我们不应该对群众有任何责备。但是，区、乡干部却应该时常注意到对群众进行经常性优抚工作的教育，并且注意加强对优属小组的领导。
    优抚工作有许多年的历史，对革命斗争曾经发生过非常重要的作用；在今天，当一切条件都比过去无比优越的时候，我们当然应该把优抚工作作得更好。我们必须尽一切的努力，确定地保证烈属军属的生活不低于当地一般群众的生活水平。
