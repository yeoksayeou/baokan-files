Xinhua News Agency report: Since the implementation of wage reform, a new phenomenon has emerged in state-owned and local state-owned factories in Tianjin: a large number of workers are requesting to learn and master new technologies and break through production quotas.

In the Tianjin Machine Tool Factory, where over 90% of workers received wage increases and more than half were promoted, the labor productivity in July increased by 10.2% compared to the plan, and the total output value plan was completed by 110.92%. In the Tianjin Engineering Machinery Factory, good news about over-fulfilling plans and improving technology to increase output and quality has been constantly posted recently. In the past, the wage system in this factory was very chaotic; even for workers of the same grade, there were nine different wage levels. In this wage reform, in accordance with the principle of "to each according to his work," wage standards were unified, and 64.54% of the skilled workers were promoted, greatly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for labor. In the metalworking workshop of this factory, more than 64% of the lathe operators and fitters exceeded their production plans in early August.

The workers' enthusiasm for learning technology has become even more prominent after the wage reform. A large number of workers participated in technical lectures, technical training classes, and signed apprenticeship contracts. Many lathe operators and fitters from factories such as the Tianjin Medical Device Factory and the Tanggu Shipyard Repair Factory participated in technical lectures or technical training classes held by cultural palaces and cultural centers. In order to meet the workers' urgent need to learn technology, the Tianjin Second Workers' Cultural Palace held a "Rationalization Proposal Drawing Class" for more than 80 lathe operators and fitters in July; starting in late August, it will also hold special technical lectures for mechanical workers and others. Veteran technical workers from the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory have recently drawn up plans to train apprentices. Sun Jiaoyao, a veteran fitter in the repair workshop who was promoted to eighth-grade worker this time, guaranteed to use accelerated methods to make all apprentices become third-grade skilled workers.

    工资改革以后
    天津工人积极学习新技术
    据新华社讯　大批的工人要求学习、掌握新技术和突破生产定额，这是天津市国营和地方国营工厂实行工资改革以后出现的新气象。
    有90％以上的工人增加了工资、半数以上的工人升级的天津市机床厂，七月份劳动生产率比计划提高了10.2％，总产值计划完成了110.92％。在天津市工程机械厂，最近不断贴出超额完成计划和改进技术提高产量、质量的捷报。这个厂过去工资制度十分紊乱，同是一级工，却有九等不同的工资。这次工资改革中，根据按劳取酬的原则，统一了工资标准，有64.54％的技术工人升了级，大大激发了工人的劳动热情。这个厂金工车间有64％以上的车工和钳工，在八月上旬都超额完成了生产计划。
    工人们积极学习技术的热情，在工资改革以后表现得更为突出。大批的工人参加了技术讲座、技术学习班和签订了师徒合同。天津市医疗器械厂、塘沽船舶修造厂等厂的许多车工、钳工，参加了文化宫和文化馆举办的技术讲座或技术学习班。天津市第二工人文化宫为了满足工人学习技术的迫切要求，在七月份为八十多名车工和钳工举办了一个“合理化建议绘图讲习班”；从八月下旬起，还要陆续举办机械工人等专题技术讲座。国营天津第四棉纺织厂的老技术工人，最近都订出了培养徒工的计划。这次被提升为八级工的修机车间老钳工孙家尧，保证要用速成的方法使徒工都成为三级技术工人。
