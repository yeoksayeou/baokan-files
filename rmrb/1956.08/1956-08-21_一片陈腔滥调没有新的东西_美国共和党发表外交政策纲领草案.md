Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, San Francisco Dispatch: The Republican Party Convention Proposals Committee released a draft of the Republican foreign policy platform on August 19th. This draft platform will be submitted to the Republican Party Convention for approval on August 21st.

    In order to win the votes of American voters who yearn for peace, the draft platform makes no mention of the "brinkmanship" policy or the "massive retaliation" policy put forward by the Republican government during its four years in power. The draft platform states that currently "the nation is at peace, the Korean War has ended, and the threat of world war has receded." Four years ago, the Republican Party came to power on the slogan of "ending the Korean War."

    The draft platform boasts about the Republican government's foreign policy over the past four years. It specifically cites the 1955 Geneva Four-Power Summit, emphasizing that Eisenhower's decision to attend the meeting in Geneva was one of the "important steps" taken by the Republican government "to eliminate the danger of a Third World War."

    This draft platform vigorously promotes Eisenhower's personal role. It says that allowing Eisenhower to continue to lead the United States "is extremely important" because his "vigilance and foresight" can guarantee "striving for and maintaining peace."

    The Republican platform draft opposes restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and reiterates the US embargo policy. It says: Communist China's entry into the United Nations should be regarded as a "betrayal" of Nationalist China and should be opposed. Furthermore, any trade with countries in the Communist region that would "threaten the security of the United States and our allies" should be prohibited.

    When discussing its policy towards the Middle East, the draft platform only states that disputes in this region of the world are a "major threat to international peace." It also says that the best hope for peace in the Middle East lies in the United Nations.

    The Republican foreign policy guidelines proposed in the draft are: to continue to maintain the so-called "collective security system" consisting of various military blocs pieced together by the United States; to continue providing foreign aid to help America's allies maintain military and economic strength; and to continue striving for "restoring German unification" and "liberating" the so-called "satellite countries" (referring to the people's democracies of Eastern Europe) through a "firmly implemented policy of peace." The draft platform also advocates reducing trade barriers "on a gradual, selective, and reciprocal basis," but it must continue to "fully recognize the need to protect domestic enterprises, agriculture, and labor from unfair import competition."

    一片陈腔滥调没有新的东西
    美国共和党发表外交政策纲领草案
    新华社20日讯　旧金山消息：共和党代表大会提案委员会在八月十九日发表了共和党外交政策纲领草案。这个纲领草案将在八月二十一日提交共和党代表大会通过。
    为了争取渴望和平的美国选民的选票，纲领草案没有提到共和党政府当政四年中提出的“战争边缘”政策和“大规模报复”政策。纲领草案说，目前“国家是处在和平之下，朝鲜战争已经结束，世界大战的威胁已经减退”。四年前，共和党就是靠“结束朝鲜战争”的口号而上台的。
    纲领草案替共和党政府当政四年来的外交政策吹嘘。它特别举出1955年的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议，强调艾森豪威尔决定前往日内瓦参加会议是共和党政府“为了消除第三次世界大战的危险”而采取的“重要步骤”之一。
    这个纲领草案竭力宣传艾森豪威尔的个人作用。它说，让艾森豪威尔继续领导美国“是十分重要的”，因为他的“警惕和远见”能够保证“争取到和平和维持和平”。
    共和党纲领草案反对恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位，并且重申美国的禁运政策。它说：应该认为共产党中国的进入联合国就是对于国民党中国的“出卖”而予以反对。又说，同共产党地区国家的任何贸易，如果会“威胁美国和我们的盟国的安全”的话，就都应该禁止。
    纲领草案在谈到对中东的政策的时候只是说，世界这个地区的争执是“对国际和平的巨大威胁”。它并且说，中东和平最好的希望在于联合国。
    草案提出的共和党的外交政策方针是：继续维持由美国拼凑的各种军事集团构成的所谓“集体安全体系”；继续提供对外援助，帮助美国的盟国保持军事和经济力量；继续通过“坚定执行的和平政策”来争取“恢复德国统一”并且“解放”所谓“卫星国家”（指东欧人民民主国家）。纲领草案还主张“在逐步的、有选择的和互惠的基础上”降低贸易壁垒，但是必须继续“充分认识到保障国内企业、农业和劳工防止不公平的输入竞争的必要性”。
