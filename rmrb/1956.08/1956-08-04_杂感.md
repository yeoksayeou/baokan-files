Random Thoughts

The French Chairman of the Suez Canal Company was ordered by the Egyptian authorities to "leave his post indefinitely" (Agence France-Presse, Cairo, July 28th).

The times are advancing like a stampede of horses. Everything that is stale and decaying is being thrown out of the historical orbit one by one, becoming fossils and relics. If colonialism does not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of human political life, it can only be ordered by the people to "leave its post indefinitely"!

What is there to object to about Egyptians reclaiming a river dug by Egyptians and flowing through Egyptian territory?

Former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, said it well: as long as this canal "happens" to be in Egyptian territory, then the Egyptian people's demand to enjoy the rights related to this river is "legitimate" (Indian Press Trust, July 30th).

London "happens" to be in Britain, and no one can object to the British people's right to be its masters; Paris "happens" to be in France, and no one can say that the French should not live in Paris.

Those who are dreaming old colonial dreams and not waking up, tear your hair and lament! Blame your own fate! Why doesn't the Suez Canal "happen" to flow in front of your house?

Or blame yourselves for why you can't "happen" to occupy other people's homes forever?

The nationalization of this canal is to build water conservancy projects. Building water conservancy projects is to improve people's living standards, reduce disasters, make people less prone to hunger and death, and enable people to live like human beings!

But the colonialists are furious, hissing like a nest of snakes, their bodies twisted together, their heads huddled together, discussing: how to threaten the Egyptian people with methods such as freezing Egyptian funds, boycotting Egyptian cotton, stopping the supply of materials, and "taking certain naval actions."

People want to live, and want to live better. Those who don't let people live hate this desire to "also want to live" the most. In their view, this desire is "illegal" and "violates international law."

    苏彝士运河公司法籍董事长由埃及当局命令“无限期离职”（法新社开罗七月二十八日电）。
    时代像万马奔腾般前进。一切陈腐和衰朽的，正在一一被抛出历史轨道，成为化石和古迹。殖民主义如果不自动退出人类政治生活的舞台，也只能由人民来命令它“无限期离职”了！*
    埃及人收回由埃及人开凿的、流过埃及领土的河流，这有什么可以反对的？
    前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查理说得妙，只要这条运河“碰巧”是在埃及的领土中，那末，埃及人要求享受有关这条河的权利，就是“正当”的（印度报业托辣斯七月三十日电）。
    伦敦“碰巧”是在英国，谁都不能反对英国人有权作它的主人；巴黎“碰巧”是在法国，谁都不能说法国人反倒不应该住在巴黎。
    做着殖民主义旧梦而不醒的人们，揪着你们的头发悲叹吧！埋怨你们自己的命运吧！苏彝士运河为什么不“碰巧”流在你们的家门口？
    或者埋怨你们为什么不能永远“碰巧”去占住别人的家园？*
    把这条运河收回国有，是为了要建设水利工程。建设水利工程，是为了要提高人民的生活水准，减少灾荒，使人不那么容易饥饿死亡，使人能够像一个人那样地活！
    可是殖民主义者发怒了，像一窝蛇一样发出嘶叫，它们的身子扭成一股，它们的脑袋凑在一起，商量着：怎样用冻结埃及资金、抵制埃及棉花、停止供应物资、“采取某些海军行动”等等办法来威胁埃及人民。
    人们想活下去，想活得好一些。不让人们活下去的人最痛恨的就是这种“也想活”的愿望。这种愿望，在他们看来是“非法”的，“违反国际法”的。
