Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 15th: Recently, large quantities of flood prevention and disaster relief supplies urgently needed are being shipped from Shanghai to Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong and other places.

Not long ago, the Shanghai municipal commercial departments allocated more than 250,000 grass bags and gunny sacks to help the Anhui Province Huai River Harnessing Committee, Huainan Mining Bureau and other units with flood prevention and flood control. Recently, with the emergency situation in the Harbin area, 60,000 gunny sacks shipped from Shanghai were received ahead of schedule. In order to promptly help YuHang, Ningbo and other areas in Zhejiang that were seriously affected by the typhoon to repair houses, the Shanghai municipal commercial departments, when allocating hardware materials such as galvanized wire and round nails for repairing houses, in addition to retaining a portion for urgent use in Shanghai, gave priority to allocating most of the pre-prepared inventory to them.

The Shanghai Railway Transportation Branch of the Shanghai Railway Administration extracted a large number of wagons, temporarily postponing goods that could wait, to transport fertilizer urgently needed for restoring agricultural production, as well as grass bags for flood control, to Shandong, Henan, and Gansu, and shipped them on time according to their requested schedule. The Shanghai Port Authority, amidst tight lighterage tasks in the city, also tried its best to allocate several ships to transport a large number of gunny sacks to Harbin.

    大批防汛救灾物资正从上海调往各地
    新华社上海15日电　最近，大批防汛、救灾急用的物资，正从上海陆续运往浙江、安徽、山东等地。
    不久前，上海市商业部门曾经调拨二十五万多条草袋、麻袋，帮助安徽省治淮委员会、淮南矿务局等单位防汛、防洪。最近，哈尔滨地区水情紧急，又提前得到上海运去的六万条麻袋。为了及时帮助浙江余杭、宁波等受台风灾害较严重地区抢修房屋，上海市商业部门在分配抢修房屋的五金器材铅丝、圆钉等物资时，除留一部分供应上海市急用外，把预先准备的大部分库存物资，都优先调拨给他们。
    上海铁路管理局上海铁路运输分局抽出暂缓可以待运货物的大量车皮，分别为山东、河南、甘肃装运恢复农业生产急用的肥田粉，以及防洪用的草袋，并根据他们要求的时间，按时起运。上海区港务管理局在全市驳运任务紧张之际，也尽力调拨了若干船只，为哈尔滨市运了大批麻袋。
