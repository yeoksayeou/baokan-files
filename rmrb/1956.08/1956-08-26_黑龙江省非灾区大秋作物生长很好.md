Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 24th. The millions of hectares of large autumn crops in the broad non-disaster areas of Heilongjiang Province are generally growing well this year. According to a typical survey by the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, if there are no major unexpected disasters in the future, the harvest may be better than last year. The best-growing crop in the province is corn, with thick and strong stalks and large ears, mostly with two ears per plant. Soybeans are also growing very well, with many pods containing three beans. Rice has already headed and is flowering.

Currently, various counties are continuing to carry out field management of large autumn crops, loosening the soil between rows and weeding, to promote early maturity and increased yields of these crops.

    黑龙江省非灾区大秋作物生长很好
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省今年广大非灾区的数百万公顷大秋作物普遍生长良好。据黑龙江省农业厅的典型调查，如果今后再没有重大意外灾害，收成可能比去年好。全省生长最好的是玉米，秧棵粗壮、棒穗大，大多一棵结两棒。大豆生长也非常好，很多一角装三个豆粒。水稻已经抽穗扬花。
    现在各县正继续进行大秋作物的田间管理工作，放秋垅和除草，促使这些作物早熟和增收。
