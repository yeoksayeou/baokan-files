Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 30th - In a statement issued in Karachi on the 28th, Pakistani Prime Minister Ali suggested that a meeting of the parties participating in the coalition government be convened as soon as possible, at which he would present his policies and programs. The current Pakistani central government is composed of the Muslim League and the United Front.

He said that inter-party strife and infighting have recently undermined Pakistan's political life. Our brave and patient people are confused and don't know what to do. Our international prestige has been damaged by the events that have occurred domestically.

Ali said that in order to eliminate all doubts, I suggest that a meeting of the parties participating in the coalition government, which elected me as their leader and Prime Minister, be convened as soon as possible. I will present my policies and my plans to them. If they agree with these policies and plans, I will ask for full support and unfettered power to implement them. However, if they do not agree with my policies and plans, I will be free to take actions that I believe are most in the national interest. In any case, there is no room for uncertainty or confusion.

    为了稳定巴基斯坦政局
    阿里主张各执政党会商决策
    据新华社喀喇蚩30日电　巴基斯坦总理阿里二十八日在喀喇蚩发表的一篇声明中，建议及早召开参加联合政府的党派的会议，他将在这次会议上提出他的政策和纲领。现在的巴基斯坦中央政府是由穆斯林联盟和联合阵线组成的。
    他说，党派间的纷争和内讧近来已破坏了巴基斯坦的政治生活。我们的勇敢和有耐心的人民弄得茫然不知所从。我们的国际威望由于国内接着发生的事件受到损害。
    阿里说，为了消除一切怀疑，我建议及早召开一次参加联合政府的党派的会议，这些党派选了我作它们的领袖和总理。我将向它们提出我的政策和我的计划。如果他们同意这些政策和计划的话，我将要求得到充分支持和不受约束的权力来实现它们。然而，如果它们不同意我的政策和计划的话，我将有自由采取我认为最符合国家利益的行动。无论如何是没有不肯定或混乱的余地。
