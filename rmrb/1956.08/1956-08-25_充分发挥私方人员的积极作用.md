Shanghai Promotes a Batch of Private Personnel to Leadership Positions

    Among the private personnel who were absorbed into state-owned companies in Shanghai's socialist transformation last year, dozens of people with rich business experience and technical expertise were promoted to leadership positions at all levels in early August. Among them, nine people were appointed as consultants, deputy managers of state-owned wholesale stores, deputy directors of wholesale departments, and deputy section chiefs of business sections of state-owned companies.

    Zhuang Yongchang, who now works at the Shanghai State-owned Cultural Supplies Company, had long been engaged in the wholesale paper business before working at the state-owned company. He has a strong ability to identify the specifications, varieties, and properties of various machine-made papers. After working at the state-owned company, he performed well in both work and study and has now been appointed as the deputy manager of the paper wholesale store. Qiu Shaobai, a 64-year-old private employee, has worked in pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories since 1916. He is not only familiar with the production and sales of Western medicines but also an experienced pharmacist. He has recently been appointed as a consultant to the No. 2 Wholesale Store of the Shanghai State-owned Pharmaceutical Company.

More Than 100 Private Personnel in Chongqing Awarded as Advanced Workers

    A group of advanced workers has emerged among the private personnel in Chongqing's joint state-private shops. In the most concentrated commercial area in the city center, 129 private personnel were awarded as advanced workers.

    Among these advanced workers are representatives of industry and commerce, managers and deputy managers of stores, directors of sales departments, as well as ordinary salespersons, warehouse keepers, and financial accountants.

    A few days ago, reporters visited Xiang Xinghua, Du Bing, and other private personnel who were awarded as advanced workers. They said: As members of the bourgeoisie, we are truly happy to be awarded as advanced workers. Xiang Xinghua, manager of the joint state-private Minsheng Road Cultural Supplies Store (headquarters), said that after the enterprise became joint state-private, he relied on the state-owned company and public representatives to conscientiously accept transformation, implement and publicize national policies, and gained the trust of the employees. He said that he used to be the deputy manager of a private paper store, but now he is the manager of a headquarters store, handling the affairs of sixteen business locations every day. His responsibility is much greater than before, and his desire for transformation and progress is even more urgent. Recently, he also helped dozens of private personnel formulate personal transformation plans in his capacity as the head of the Democratic National Construction Association branch.

    Among these private personnel, many have made rapid progress in the past six months. Yu Ziting, deputy director of the joint state-private Xindaxiang Cotton Cloth Sales Department, did not have a clear understanding of the policy of transforming private industry and commerce in the past. He treated operations and learning negatively and sometimes even came up with bad ideas in the enterprise. However, after the entire industry became joint state-private and he took the post of deputy director of the Xindaxiang Cotton Cloth Sales Department, he changed his attitude and actively led the employees and private personnel to increase shelves and improve the display of goods, increasing the variety of cotton cloths from more than 500 to more than 800. When the sales department formed a mobile sales team, he enthusiastically participated and went deep into remote alleys with the employees to sell cloth, which kept the sales department's business very good, and it won the Red Banner of Excellence for three consecutive months.

More Than 7,000 Private Personnel in Shanghai's Joint State-Private Factories Actively Participate in Socialist Emulation Drives

    There are now more than 7,690 joint state-private factories in Shanghai, and the private personnel are participating in socialist emulation drives together with the employees. Among them, 1,000 people have received rewards and commendations, and some have won the honorary titles of advanced producer and advanced worker.

    According to a recent survey by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, nearly 80% of the joint state-private factories in the city that have launched socialist emulation drives have private personnel participating.

    During the crash production of double-wheeled double-shared plows this spring, more than 580 factories launched socialist emulation drives. Many private personnel in these factories actively participated in the drives. After the production tasks were completed, five districts rewarded more than 240 private personnel. Since then, more and more private personnel in other industries have participated in socialist emulation drives.

    Private personnel participating in socialist emulation drives generally set their own conditions or guarantees based on the work they are responsible for. Private personnel managers and factory directors in cotton spinning, wool spinning, cotton cloth weaving and dyeing, pharmaceutical, and pen-making industries participate in the competition by guaranteeing the establishment of production plans and enterprise management systems. Section chiefs and section members participate in intra-departmental competition of the same business, and the conditions of the competition also revolve around current production tasks and work requirements. Many private personnel have shown initiative in the competition and have played a good role in improving production and management. Hu Zhiqin, a private employee of the China Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Factory, successfully trial-produced a 12-watt motor for electric clocks. The factory originally only made electric clocks with a diameter of 0.9 meters, but now it can produce large electric clocks with a diameter of more than 2 meters.

Some Private Personnel in Chengdu Go to Other Places to Purchase General Merchandise

    Recently, some private personnel from Chengdu's joint state-private department stores were divided into two groups to purchase general merchandise and daily necessities in Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, Baoji, and various counties in the western Sichuan Plain to meet consumer needs.

    They are mostly managers, deputy managers, and business section chiefs of various joint state-private stores, with many years of business experience and technical expertise, and are quite familiar with local consumer needs and the production and sales situation in other regions. Hu Shuzi, the current business section chief of the Chengdu Joint State-Private Department Store, has long been engaged in the wholesale of general merchandise and is familiar with the production areas, quality, and price conditions of various general merchandise. This time, he was sent by the general store to Shanghai to purchase general merchandise to supply the sales departments of some joint state-private stores and more than 1,000 small vendors in Chengdu.

Dongsi District, Beijing Rewards Private Personnel

    Several hundred private personnel from joint state-private factories and stores in Dongsi District, Beijing, recently gathered in a workers' club to hold a socialist emulation drive report and commendation meeting. One hundred and twenty-one private personnel received awards. These award winners were all advanced figures selected from the first half of the year's competition for their outstanding creations or improvements in production and management.

    Li Chongshan, a private employee of the Kewei Medical Equipment Factory who received an award, improved five kinds of tools in less than three months due to his active research into technology. A tool he installed for bending iron plates can completely replace manual operation in the past, increasing labor efficiency by seven times. When Jing Shoushan, a private employee of the Bai Kui Restaurant, appeared on stage to receive the award, he attracted the attention of the people present. This nearly 70-year-old mutton master publicly revealed the formula of 24 kinds of mutton seasonings that had been locked in the safe for decades, restoring the special flavor of mutton that had been interrupted for nine years. He also paid attention to taking apprentices and unreservedly passing on the centuries-old ancestral mutton-making techniques and his own life experience.

    充分发挥私方人员的积极作用
    据新华社讯
    上海提升一批私方人员担任领导职务
    去年在社会主义改造中被吸收到国营公司工作的上海市批发商店的私方人员中，有几十个具有丰富业务经验和技术特长的人，在八月初被提升到各级领导岗位。其中有九人担任了顾问、国营批发商店副经理、批发部副主任、国营公司业务科副科长等职务。
    现在在上海市国营文化用品公司工作的庄永昌，在到国营公司工作以前，曾经长期从事纸张批发业务，对各种机制纸张的规格、品种、性能有很强的识别能力，到国营公司工作以后，工作和学习都表现得很好，现在被任命为纸张批发商店副经理。六十四岁的私方人员裘少白，从1916年起就在药房、药厂工作，他不仅熟悉西药的产销情况，而且是一个具有丰富经验的药剂师。最近他已被任命为上海市国营医药公司第二批发商店的顾问。
    重庆百余私方人员被评为先进工作者
    重庆市各公私合营商店的私方人员中出现了一批先进工作者。商店最集中的市中心区被评为先进工作者的私方人员就有一百二十九人。
    这些先进工作者中，有工商界的代表人物、商店的经理、副经理和门市部主任，也有普通的售货员、保管员和财务会计人员。
    前些日子，记者访问了被评为先进工作者的私方人员向兴华、杜冰等人，他们说：作为资产阶级分子，能被评为先进工作者，真是感到高兴。公私合营民生路文化用品商店（总店）经理向兴华说，他在企业合营以后依靠国营公司和公方代表，认真接受改造，贯彻和宣传国家政策，得到了职工的信任，他说，他原来是一个私营纸店的副经理，现在当了一个总店的经理，天天要处理十六个营业点的事务，责任比过去大得多，自己要求改造和进步的心更为迫切。最近，他又以民主建国会的支部负责人名义，帮助几十个私方人员制订个人改造规划。
    在这些私方人员中，有许多人在最近半年来进步很快。公私合营新大祥棉布门市部副主任余梓庭，过去对私营工商业改造的政策认识不清楚，消极地对待经营和学习，有时还在企业中出些坏主意，但在全行业公私合营并且担任新大祥棉布门市部副主任以后，就改变了态度，积极地领导门市部职工和私方人员增加货架，改进商品陈设，把棉布的花色品种由原来的五百多种增加到八百多种，当门市部成立流动推销组时，他也热情地参加，和职工一道深入偏僻小巷推销布匹，使门市部的营业额一直很好，连续三个月得到优胜红旗。
    上海七千多个公私合营工厂的私方人员
    积极参加社会主义竞赛
    上海现在有七千六百九十多个公私合营工厂的私方人员，和职工一起参加社会主义竞赛，其中有一千人得到奖励和表扬，有的获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣称号。
    根据上海市工商业联合会最近的统计，全市已经展开社会主义竞赛的公私合营工厂中，近80％有私方人员参加。
    今年春天突击生产双轮双铧犁的时候，有五百八十多家工厂展开了社会主义竞赛，这些厂的私方人员很多积极地参加了竞赛，生产任务完成后，有五个区奖励了二百四十多个私方人员。从此，在其他各行业中参加社会主义竞赛的私方人员就越来越多了。
    参加社会主义竞赛的私方人员，一般都根据自己所担任的工作，订出竞赛的条件或保证。棉纺、毛纺、棉布织染、制药、制笔等工业的部分厂的私方人员经理、厂长，以保证订立生产计划、建立企业管理制度等条件参加竞赛；科长、科员参加了科室之间的同业务竞赛，竞赛的条件也环绕当前的生产任务和工作要求。许多私方人员在竞赛中发挥了积极性，对生产和管理的改进起了好的作用。中华科学仪器制造厂私方人员胡芝琴试制成功了电钟上的十二瓦特电动机，这个厂原来只造直径零点九公尺的电钟，现在已能生产直径二公尺以上的大电钟了。
    成都部分私方人员
    到外地去采购百货
    成都市部分公私合营百货商店的私方人员，最近分成二批到上海、重庆、西安、宝鸡和川西平原各县去采购百货和日用品，以满足消费者的需要。
    他们大都是各公私合营商店的经理、副经理、业务股长，具有多年的业务经验和技术特长，对当地消费者的需要和外地产销情况相当熟悉。现任成都市公私合营百货总店业务股长的胡树滋，曾经长期从事百货批发业务，熟悉各种百货的产区、质量和价格情况，这次他被总店派到上海去采购百货，供给部分公私合营商店的门市部和成都市一千多户小商贩。
    北京东四区奖励私方人员
    北京市东四区公私合营厂店的几百名私方人员，最近聚集在一个工人俱乐部里，举行参加社会主义竞赛汇报表扬大会。有一百二十一个私方人员获奖。这些获奖者都是上半年竞赛中，在生产、经营上有突出创造或改进而被评选出的先进人物。
    获得奖励的科伟医疗器械厂私方人员李崇善，由于积极钻研技术，不到三个月就改进了五种工具。他装制的一种铁板围弯的工具，能全部代替过去的手工操作，使劳动效率提高了七倍。当白魁饭馆私方人员景寿山出现在台上领奖的时候，吸引了到会人们的注意。这个年近七十岁的烧羊肉能手，在竞赛中公开了在保险柜里锁了几十年的二十四种烧羊肉佐料配方，恢复了中断九年的烧羊肉特殊风味。他还很注意收带徒弟，无保留地传授几百年祖传的烧羊肉技艺和他自己一生的经验。
