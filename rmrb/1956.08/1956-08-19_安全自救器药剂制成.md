    Safe Self-Rescuer Chemical Agent Developed
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the safety self-rescuer chemical agent for miners—a carbon monoxide oxidation catalyst, which has always been imported from foreign countries—has recently been successfully developed at the Fushun Coal Research Institute.
    This chemical agent can transform the toxic gas carbon monoxide, produced in coal mines due to fires or other causes, into carbon dioxide, which is less likely to cause poisoning, through chemical action. Miners working underground who wear self-rescuers equipped with this chemical agent can safely leave the disaster area within forty minutes of a sudden fire or gas leak.

    安全自救器药剂制成
    据新华社讯　一向靠国外进口的矿工用的安全自救器药剂——一氧化碳氧化触媒剂，最近在抚顺煤炭科学研究院研究成功。
    这种药剂能使矿井下因火灾或其他原因而产生的毒性气体一氧化碳，经过化学作用变成不易中毒的二氧化碳。在井下生产的矿工戴上装有这种药剂的自救器，碰到突然发生的火灾或毒气，在灾情发生后的四十分钟内仍然可以安全地离开灾区。
