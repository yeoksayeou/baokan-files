Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 14th: The Fruit Tree Survey Team of the Department of Agriculture of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has surveyed over 160,000 mu of virgin apple forest in the Tianshan Mountain forest region along the banks of the Ili River, Tekes River, and Gongnaisi River in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.

From May to July, the survey team conducted reconnaissance in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and surveyed more than 7 million original apple trees in five counties, including Yining, Suiding, Gongliu, Xinyuan, and Huocheng. It is estimated that the annual output of apples could reach more than 750 million catties. Most of the fruit trees are mature trees that have been growing for decades, and some have been growing for more than a century with a circumference of about one arm span. These fruit trees have strong growth and have the advantages of disease resistance and disaster prevention. The virgin fruit forest is mainly composed of apples, with plums, apricots, and hawthorns interspersed among them. Many of the fruits are large, sweet, and of good quality, and can be cultivated into cultivated varieties. In the past, when the apples ripened, only a few farmers and herdsmen of Kazakh and other ethnic groups came to the edge of the forest area to pick them for winemaking and jam making. More than 90% of the fruits fell naturally and rotted in the forest. Suiding and other counties in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, where horticulture is well-developed, have begun to prepare to transform the virgin fruit forest by means of thinning and replanting.

The climate on the banks of the Ili River is mild, and the land in Yining, Suiding, Huocheng, and other counties is fertile, making them famous apple-producing areas in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

    天山山脉丛林区中
    发现十六万亩原始果林
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　新疆维吾尔自治区农业厅果树调查组，在伊犁哈萨克族自治州伊犁河、特克斯河和巩乃斯河等河流两岸天山山脉丛林区，勘查出十六万多亩原始苹果林。
    调查组从五月到七月在伊犁哈萨克族自治州进行踏勘，在伊宁、绥定、巩留、新源、霍城等五个县内勘查出原始苹果林七百多万株，估计每年可产苹果七亿五千多万斤。果林大部分都是生长几十年的壮年果树，有的已生长百年以上，粗可一围。这些果树生长力很强，都有抗病防灾的优点。原始果林以苹果为主，兼有李、杏、山楂等，其中有很多果实硕大，味甜质佳，可培育成栽培品种。过去，每当苹果成熟时，只有少数哈萨克等族的农牧民们来林区边缘采摘，用来酿酒和制作果酱，90％以上的果实都自生自落，腐烂在丛林里。伊犁哈萨克族自治州园艺发达的绥定等县开始准备用稀伐、改种等办法改造原始果林。
    伊犁河畔的气候温和，伊宁、绥定、霍城等县土地肥沃，是新疆维吾尔自治区著名苹果产地。
