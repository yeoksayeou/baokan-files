Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th. An observer of "Pravda" pointed out in an article commenting on the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the 4th that the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side on the territorial issue are an obstacle to the complete normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

The observer talked about the essence of the territorial issue, saying that everyone knows very well that international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, and the San Francisco Peace Treaty have completely resolved the issue of South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, and these territories have been completely and unconditionally returned to the Soviet Union.

The observer said that the Soviet Union agreed in the London negotiations to hand over the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan under certain conditions. The reason why the Soviet Union did this was out of its peaceful policy and to accommodate Japan. Of course, this concession by the Soviet Union can only be realized under the condition that relations between the two countries are fully normalized, that is, under the condition that a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty is signed.

The observer said that the Soviet public expects Japan to correctly understand and estimate this generous step by the Soviet Union. However, the Japanese side has once again raised the territorial issue, insisting that Japan be given Kunashir Island and Etorofu Island, which belong to the Soviet Union in the southern part of the Kuril Islands. These two islands are an inseparable part of the Kuril Islands. Therefore, Japan has no reason to make demands on the above-mentioned islands. It was pointed out during the meeting between Bulganin and Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kono in May this year that the Japanese side’s territorial claims to Kunashir Island and Etorofu Island can only be regarded as an obstacle to adjusting relations, and the Soviet side will not make any more concessions on the territorial issue. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that there is no benefit in discussing this issue further.

The observer emphatically pointed out that there is no doubt that as long as both sides sincerely hope to solve all unresolved issues, the Moscow negotiations will definitely lead to the normalization of relations between the two neighboring countries. The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan will open the way for economic cooperation between the two countries. In this regard, the Soviet government is prepared to start negotiations with Japan on concluding a treaty on trade and navigation and a trade payment agreement after the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The Soviet Union believes that in the next five years, the trade volume between the two countries can reach at least one billion rubles per year (500 million rubles for each side).

The observer finally pointed out that solving the issue of normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan is necessary to strengthen universal peace and further ease tensions. Obviously, those foreigners who hope to obstruct this solution are trying to prevent Japan from embarking on the international stage as a sovereign state.

    “真理报”观察家评论
    苏日谈判需要双方具有诚意
    日本提出领土要求是两国关系正常化主要障碍
    新华社莫斯科5日电　“真理报”观察家在四日评论苏日谈判的文章中指出，日本方面在领土问题上的无理要求，是苏日关系完全正常化道路上的障碍。
    观察家谈到领土问题的实质说，大家都很清楚，开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、雅尔达协定以及旧金山和约等国际协定已经彻底解决了关于南库页岛和千岛群岛的问题，这些领土已经完全地、无条件地交还了苏联。
    观察家说，苏联在伦敦谈判中同意在一定的条件下把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给日本，苏联所以这样做是出于它的和平政策和为了迁就日本。当然，苏联这种让步只有在两国关系完全正常化的条件下，即在签订苏日和约的情况下才能实现。
    观察家说，苏联公众期待日本能够正确理解和估计苏联这一宽宏大量的步骤。但是，日本方面却再次提出了领土问题，坚持把属于苏联的千岛群岛南部的国后岛和择捉岛让给日本。这两个岛是千岛群岛不可分割的组成部分。因此，日本没有任何理由提出对上述岛屿的要求。在今年五月布尔加宁同日本农林相河野会谈时就已经指出，日本方面对国后岛和择捉岛的领土要求只能被看做是调整关系的障碍，苏联方面在领土问题上也不会再作任何让步。因此苏联认为再讨论这个问题是不会有什么益处的。
    观察家着重指出，毫无疑问，只要双方真诚地希望解决一切没有解决的问题，莫斯科谈判一定会导致两个邻国的关系的正常化。而苏日两国关系的正常化，将为两国的经济合作开辟道路。在这方面，苏联政府准备在苏日两国关系正常化以后，开始同日本谈判缔结关于贸易和航海条约以及贸易支付协定问题。苏联认为，在今后五年中，两国之间的贸易额每年至少可以达到十亿卢布（双方各五亿卢布）。
    观察家最后指出，苏日两国解决关系正常化问题是加强普遍和平和进一步缓和紧张局势所必需的。显然地，希望阻挠这种解决的首先是这样一些外国人，他们力图阻止日本作为一个主权国家走上国际舞台。
