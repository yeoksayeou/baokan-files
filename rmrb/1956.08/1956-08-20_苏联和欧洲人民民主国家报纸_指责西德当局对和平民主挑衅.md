Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: According to TASS Moscow, many Soviet newspapers published articles on the 18th, commenting on the West German Federal Constitutional Court's decision to ban the German Communist Party.

"Pravda's" Berlin correspondent, Mikhailov, wrote that this repression has aroused the indignation of the working people of West Germany. The correspondent pointed out that the arbitrary actions taken against the German Communist Party are another step by West Germany towards militarization and fascism. The decision made by the Karlsruhe Court to please West German monopolists and militarists violates the fundamental interests of the German people. It shows that the West German authorities are following in Hitler's footsteps.

"Soviet Russia" newspaper published an article by Dajiangci, pointing out that the decision to declare the German Communist Party illegal threatens the democratic rights and freedoms of the West German people and seriously undermines the national interests of the German people. The public in Germany and around the world considers this action an open provocation against the cause of peace and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 19th: The illegal decision of the West German authorities to ban the German Communist Party has aroused indignation in the public opinion circles of European People's Democratic countries.

When the news came, workers in many factories in Prague, Ostrava, Pilsen and other cities in Czechoslovakia immediately held meetings to discuss the situation and sent telegrams and letters of protest and condemnation to the Bonn authorities.

Czechoslovakia's "Red Right News" published an editorial on August 18, saying that in making the verdict to declare the Communist Party illegal, the West German government has abandoned the foundation of democracy.

Poland's "People's Tribune" wrote that the Bonn government hopes to use the action of attacking the Communist Party to undermine the atmosphere of peaceful coexistence and easing international tensions. However, the result of doing so will be that the people of European countries will further strengthen and expand the struggle for collective security and further unite the countries that have been repeatedly invaded by German militarists.

Hungary's "Free People's Daily" editorial emphasized that the decision of the West German Federal Constitutional Court is a harbinger against peace, because it poses new obstacles to the peaceful resolution of the German question.

Romania's "Spark News" said that the historical experience of the development of the modern workers' movement proves that in our century, no decree or decision can destroy the movement of the working class.

Bulgaria's "Workers' Cause News" editorial said that all the people of Bulgaria expressed indignation at the decision of the West German Federal Constitutional Court and protested against the banning of the German Communist Party. "Fatherland Front News" pointed out that declaring the German Communist Party illegal is an open provocation against the democratic forces of the German people.

Albania's "Youth News" said that the action of banning the German Communist Party is a new step for West Germany towards complete fascism.

    苏联和欧洲人民民主国家报纸
    指责西德当局对和平民主挑衅
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联许多报纸在十八日刊载文章，评论西德联邦宪法法院关于禁止德国共产党的决定。
    “真理报”驻柏林记者米哈伊洛夫写道，这种镇压引起了西德劳动人民的愤慨。记者指出，对德国共产党采取的专横行动，是西德向军国主义化和法西斯化道路上迈进的又一步。卡尔斯卢厄法院为讨好西德垄断资本家和军国主义分子而作出的决定，违反德国人民的根本利益。它表明西德当局正在步希特勒的后尘。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”发表的达江茨的文章指出，宣布德国共产党非法的决定，使西德人民的民主权利和自由受到威胁，使德国人民的民族利益遭受严重打击。德国和全世界公众认为这种行动是对和平民主事业的公开挑衅。
    据新华社布拉格19日电　西德当局禁止德国共产党的非法决定，引起了欧洲各人民民主国家舆论界的愤慨。
    当这个消息传来的时候，捷克斯洛伐克的布拉格、俄斯特拉发、比尔森和其他城市的许多工厂中的工人们立即举行集会讨论这一情况，并且向波恩当局发出了表示抗议和谴责的电报和信件。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”八月十八日发表社论说，在作出宣布共产党为非法的判决的情况下，西德政府已经放弃了民主的基础。
    波兰“人民论坛报”写道，波恩政府希望利用攻击共产党的这个行动来破坏和平共处和缓和国际紧张局势的气氛。然而这样作的结果，将是欧洲各国人民更加加强和扩大争取集体安全和进一步团结曾经多次遭受德国军国主义者的侵略的各个国家的斗争。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”的社论强调指出，西德联邦宪法法院的决定是反对和平的先声，因为它为和平解决德国问题提出了新的障碍。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”说，现代工人运动发展的历史经验证明，在我们的世纪，没有什么法令或者决定能够摧毁工人阶级的运动。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”的社论说，保加利亚全体人民对西德联邦宪法法院的决定表示愤慨，并且抗议禁止德国共产党。“祖国阵线报”指出，宣布德国共产党非法是对德国人民民主力量的公开的挑衅。
    阿尔巴尼亚“青年报”说，禁止德国共产党的行动，是西德走向彻底的法西斯化的一个新的步骤。
