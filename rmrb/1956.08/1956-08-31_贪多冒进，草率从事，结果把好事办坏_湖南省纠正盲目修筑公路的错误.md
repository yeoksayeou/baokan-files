Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 29th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Chongzhang reports): The Hunan Provincial Transportation Department, at a recent local transportation conference, proposed correcting the practice of blindly building simple highways in certain areas. Of the more than 2,500 kilometers of simple highways that have already started construction but have not yet been completed throughout the province, more than 300 kilometers are of little economic value or are not urgently needed at present, and it has now been decided to convert them into rural roads. The remaining 2,100 kilometers are scheduled to be completed in the next two years.

From January to the end of July this year, a total of 158 simple highways were started in the province, with a total length of more than 2,720 kilometers. Among them, twelve roads with a total length of more than 230 kilometers have been completed; nearly 2,500 kilometers have not been completed. Now, these roads are not only unable to be used by cars, but also inconvenient for pushing wheelbarrows or walking, which has aroused dissatisfaction among farmers. In addition, the high plan for the construction of simple highways has also prevented the provincial highway department from starting construction on more than 500 kilometers of trunk lines with considerable economic value, which were originally planned to be built this year.

At the second Hunan Provincial Local Transportation Conference held in January this year, the relevant leading organs of the province proposed that the plan for building simple highways in the province this year was 1,600 kilometers, but the representatives of the prefectures and counties who attended the meeting did not specifically study the financial and human resources conditions for building these highways, and proposed a plan to build more than 6,700 kilometers this year. At that time, although the provincial leadership knew that this plan was too high, they were afraid that the plan they proposed was conservative and would restrain the enthusiasm of the counties, so they vaguely said to the representatives that each locality should act according to its capacity and build as much as it could. Therefore, after the meeting, many counties started digging without surveying the lines. Some simple highways were built along the old sidewalks; others were determined after local farmers led county and district cadres for a walk. On the Yongshun line, a road was dug by cadres leading farmers, but it was stopped by a big mountain, and then it was reworked. Some lines had not started construction at both ends, but were first dug horizontally in the middle. Due to improper line selection, the slopes of many routes are too steep. According to regulations, the maximum slope of a simple highway should not exceed 11%, but some of the simple highways built in Hunan this year have slopes close to 30%. For example, the section from Wugang to Dengjiapu is a continuous undulating wave-like road, with slopes ranging from a minimum of 12% to a maximum of 32%. It is difficult for trucks to travel on such roads, not to mention manual vehicles. Therefore, individual sections of many lines have to be re-selected. For example, six kilometers of the section from Xinhua to Yangxi need to be re-built because the slope is too large, and it is estimated that 14,000 labor days of farmers will be wasted; 13 kilometers of the section from Chengbu to Menping need to be re-built, and it is estimated that 20,000 labor days will be wasted. Although some simple highways are currently barely open to traffic, it is difficult to guarantee normal traffic in the spring rains next year because the drainage is not good and the bridges are not built according to standard drawings.

When Hunan Province built a large number of simple highways, it did not take into account the burden on farmers. In many places, farmers participated in road construction not for five days per person, but for ten or even twenty days, which greatly exceeded the State Council's regulations on the number of days of civil construction. Although in some remote mountainous areas, farmers are willing to contribute more labor to build roads for the convenience of transportation, but due to the lack of technical guidance, some have to be reworked, and some cannot be opened to traffic due to excessive slopes or insufficient funds to build some bridges and culverts, and farmers have complaints.

In the nine months from November last year to July this year, the local transportation departments in Hunan Province have completed and opened more than 600 kilometers of highways. This has connected the rural areas in the remote mountainous areas of eight counties including Guidong, Rucheng, Jiahe, and Fenghuang with cities by cars, greatly facilitating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in these areas. The transportation situation in rural Hunan was relatively backward in the past. A large part of the province's villages did not rely on highways or waterways. It was originally a good thing to build some simple highways appropriately. However, if we ignore the conditions in all aspects and want to complete the work done in twelve years in three or five years, it will make things backfire.

    贪多冒进，草率从事，结果把好事办坏
    湖南省纠正盲目修筑公路的错误
    新华社长沙29日电　新华社记者罗重璋报道：湖南省交通部门在最近召开的地方交通会议上，提出纠正某些地区盲目修筑简易公路的做法。全省已经动工尚未修好的两千五百多公里的简易公路中，有三百多公里经济价值不大或非目前所急需的公路，现在决定改为乡村大道；剩下的二千一百多公里决定在今、明两年完成。
    从今年1月到7月底，全省动工修建的简易公路共有一百五十八条，总长二千七百二十多公里。其中，已经完成的有十二条共二百三十多公里；还有近二千五百公里没有修成。现在这些路不但不能通汽车，就是推独轮车或步行都不方便，引起农民不满。另外，由于简易公路修筑计划偏高，还使省公路厅原计划今年要修的具有相当经济价值的五百多公里干线不能动工。
    在今年1月召开的湖南省第二次地方交通会议上，省的有关领导机关提出今年全省修建简易公路的计划是一千六百公里，而到会的各专区和县的代表，并没有具体研究修筑这些公路的财力和人力等条件，就提出今年修六千七百多公里的计划，当时，省的领导机关虽然知道这个计划偏高，但又怕自己所提计划保守，束缚各县的积极性，于是就含混地对代表们说，各地量力而行，能修多少算多少。因此，会后许多县不经选线测量，一声令下便开工挖起来。有的简易公路是沿着旧有人行道修；有的是由当地农民领着县、区干部走一趟就算定了线。永顺线有一条路由干部领着农民挖，挖到一个大山头挡住了，又返工。有的在一条线上两端还没动工，却在中间先横腰挖起来。由于选线不当，许多路线的坡度过大。按规定，简易公路的最大坡度不得超过11％，但湖南今年修的这些简易公路中，有的坡度近30％，如武岗到邓家铺是一段连续起伏波浪式的路，坡度由最小的12％到最大的32％，这样的路，不用说载重汽车难行，就是人力车也很难爬上去。因此有许多线的个别段就不得不另外选线重修。如新化到洋溪一段有六公里因坡度太大，须要另修他线，估计浪费农民一万四千个劳动日；城步到门坪一段有十三公里要另修，估计要浪费两万个工。有些简易公路虽然目前已经勉强通车，但因为排水情况不好，桥梁也多未按标准图做，到明年春雨一来很难保证正常通车。
    湖南省各地大量修建简易公路的时候，对农民的负担也没有很好考虑。许多地方农民参加修路的建勤日每人不是五天而是十天甚至二十天，大大超过国务院关于民工建勤日的规定。虽然在一些偏僻山区，农民为了便利运输是乐意多出些工来修路的，可是由于缺乏技术指导，有的要返工，有的因坡度太大，或由于经费不足，一些桥梁、涵管修不起来而不能通车，农民就有意见了。
    湖南省地方交通部门在去年11月到今年7月的九个月中，已经修好通车的公路有六百多公里。这使桂东、汝城、嘉禾、凤凰等八个县的偏僻山区的农村都有汽车和城市联系起来，大大便利了这些地区的城乡物资交流。湖南农村中的交通运输状况过去是比较落后的，全省有很大一部分乡村不靠公路也不靠航道。适当修建一些简易公路，原是该办的事情。但是如果不顾各方面的条件，想把十二年中做的事，在三、五年内完成，这就使得事与愿违了。
