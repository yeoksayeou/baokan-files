    Holding Breath and Trembling with Fear
    If someone goes to the West German Federal Parliament and sees the parliament holding its breath and listening to Adenauer's speech, please don't think that the parliamentarians are attracted by Adenauer's speech. The official "West Berlin Daily" once wrote: "Every time Adenauer steps onto the podium, the parliament is trembling with fear. The opposition waits for a major mistake in his public speech. Therefore, the holding of breath in parliament is not a happy one, but a fearful anticipation, fearing that he will say something inappropriate again and arouse public opposition."

    屏息静听，提心吊胆
    如果有人到西德联邦议会，看到议会屏息静听阿登纳的演说时，请不要认为议员是被阿登纳的演说吸引住了。官方的“西柏林日报”曾经这样写道：“每逢阿登纳走上讲台的时候，议会里都提心吊胆。反对派等待着他在公开演说里一种重大的错误。所以议会里的屏息静听，并不是一种高兴的，而是一种害怕的期待，恐怕他又说出不像样的话，更引起舆论的反对”。
