Do Not Impact the Retail Market
    Xi Ping
    Recently, many procurement personnel from various places have appeared in the Shanghai market, purchasing large quantities of various goods. After purchasing from wholesale departments, they flood into the retail market.

    Most of these procurement personnel carry large amounts of cash. They run from one street to another, from one store to another, buying whatever they see regardless of the price. One procurement person from the women's clothing store outside Qianmen in Beijing purchased and ordered 1,000 pieces of various woolen and cashmere women's fashions at twelve state-private joint venture fashion stores such as Da Mei and Tian Xiang in Shanghai at one time. A procurement person from the Dalian Department Store went into the Hujiang Store to purchase goods, asking for 10,000 cashmere sweaters. A procurement person from the Hunan Provincial Transportation and Telecommunications Equipment Company, after finishing purchasing at Wing On Company, instructed before leaving: "If there are goods, we will buy as much as you have."

    Commercial departments in various regions are willing to buy materials in the Shanghai retail market at high prices, supposedly to prepare for the peak season supply after autumn. Of course, it is necessary to prepare for the autumn supply work early, but the above approach is very inappropriate. The Shanghai retail market is a system of planned supply stores. After a large number of goods are bought by various regions, the supply of the Shanghai retail market is reduced, which will certainly cause dissatisfaction among local consumers. On the other hand, this massive procurement can easily create an artificial atmosphere of tension in the market, promote market fluctuations, and bring great difficulties to the supply work of Shanghai commercial departments.

    From the perspective of these commercial departments, this high-priced purchasing method is also detrimental to themselves. Because the purchase price is too high, the selling price must be raised, which will cause losses to consumers and affect local prices; otherwise, they will have to lose money.

    The supply of goods for this autumn has been prepared relatively early, and the problem is not significant. The sources of goods for commercial departments in various regions should follow the correct channels to seek a reasonable solution, rather than only considering the needs of their own region and enterprise, creating artificial tension, and affecting the stability of the entire market.

    It is hoped that commercial departments in various regions will immediately stop this blind procurement activity in the Shanghai retail market.

    不要冲击零售市场
    习平
    上海市场上最近出现了许多来自各地的采购人员，大量搜购各种货物。他们在向批发部门采购之后，又涌向零售市场。
    这些采购人员大都携带大宗现款，他们从这条马路跑到那条马路，从这个商店转到那个商店，不问售价高低，见货就买，一位从北京前门外妇女服装商店来的采购人员，在上海大美、天祥等十二家公私合营时装店里，一次就采购和定购了各种呢、毛女式时装一千件。旅大市百货公司采购人员走进沪江商店购货，开口就要绒线加克衫一万件。湖南省交通电讯器材公司的采购员在永安公司采购完了之后，临走又叮嘱说：“如果有货，有多少我们就要买多少。”
    各地区的商业部门，不惜高价到上海零售市场上来搜购物资，据说是给秋后的旺季市场供应作好准备。当然，早日做好秋后供应工作准备是必要的，但是像上面那种做法，却是很不妥当的。上海零售市场都是按计划供应的商店，各地买去了大批货品之后，减少了上海零售市场的供应量，当然会引起本市消费者的不满。另方面，这种大量采购很容易在市场上造成人为的紧张空气，促成市场的波动，给上海商业部门的供应工作带来很大困难。
    从这些商业部门来说，这种高价收买的办法对自己也是不利的。由于进货价太高，必然要抬高售价，这样就会使消费者受到损失，影响当地的物价，否则就只好赔本。
    今年秋季的货源供应问题，准备得比较早，问题并不大，各地商业部门的货源都应当循正确的途径，求得合理的解决。而不应当只顾本地区、本企业的需要，造成人为的紧张，影响整个市场的平稳。
    希望各地商业部门立即停止在上海零售市场上的这种盲目采购活动。
