Xinhua News Agency, August 26th – The Ministry of Construction Engineering has formulated technical measures, and it is estimated that nearly 10,000 tons of steel reinforcement can be saved in the second half of this year.

    According to statistics from six of the ministry's nine directly affiliated units, more than 8,000 tons of steel reinforcement can be saved in the second half of this year. These steel bars can meet the needs for constructing more than 110,000 square meters of industrial factory buildings.

    In the second half of this year, the Ministry of Construction Engineering will extensively use bamboo reinforcement to replace steel reinforcement in civil construction projects. The North China and Central South Directly Subordinate Engineering Companies and Lanzhou General Company alone will adopt this method on a construction area of 400,000 to 500,000 square meters. In the first half of this year, the Ministry of Construction Engineering had already replaced steel reinforcement with bamboo reinforcement in more than 50,000 square meters of floor slab projects. However, there is no final conclusion as to how many years these floor slabs can be used. The person in charge of the Technology Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering said that he had visited Guangzhou to see concrete floor slabs that used to be made with bamboo reinforcement mixed with very little steel reinforcement. These floor slabs are now more than 40 years old. Some of the bamboo reinforcement is intact, and some of the bamboo reinforcement has rotted due to water leakage from the roof, but the floor slabs have not been damaged. In order to make future construction projects more durable and solid, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has taken measures to change the bamboo-reinforced concrete floor slabs from flat to arched, and to replace the lightweight partition walls originally made of wood strips and other materials under the large beams with load-bearing brick walls to replace the beams; between the partition walls, small beams (each small beam only has one steel bar) made of bamboo and steel reinforcement are horizontally erected. In this way, the steel reinforcement used per square meter of standard civil construction can be reduced from 5.74 kg to 1.36 kg. Technicians and Soviet experts who have studied this method believe that this method can make buildings more solid and last longer. Because all bamboo reinforcement is coated with raw lacquer or asphalt, it can prevent the bamboo reinforcement from rotting due to moisture or bacterial corrosion. Even if the bamboo reinforcement deteriorates after decades, the building will not have problems because the floor slab is arched, and the spacing between the small beams is denser, which makes the load-bearing capacity of the arched bamboo-reinforced concrete floor slab greater than the original flat bamboo-reinforced concrete floor slab, and it can also insulate sound.

    In industrial construction, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has also begun to use bamboo reinforcement or bamboo-steel reinforcement mixed concrete components to replace non-load-bearing reinforced concrete components. For example, skylight side panels, window sill panels, heating trenches, catch basin covers, and lintels on general doors and windows.

    Cold-drawn, cold-drawn, and cold-rolled steel reinforcement are another important method for the ministry to save steel reinforcement. Steel reinforcement with a diameter of 12 mm or less can be extended by 5% after being cold-drawn and cold-drawn, and the strength can be greatly increased. If the method of binding steel reinforcement frames is changed to spot welding, 20% to 35% of steel reinforcement can be saved compared with the old method. The equipment for cold-drawing and cold-drawing steel reinforcement is relatively simple, and this method is easy to be widely adopted. Round steel reinforcement with a diameter of more than 12 mm to 32 mm can also save 30% after being cold-rolled and used.

    The Ministry of Construction Engineering has also formulated measures to save cement and wood. According to statistics from seven directly affiliated units, more than 60,000 tons of cement and more than 25,000 cubic meters of wood can be saved in the second half of this year.

    These technical measures were determined at the recent technical exchange meeting held by the Ministry of Construction Engineering and after the meeting. The ministry emphasized that the quality of the project must be ensured when adopting these measures.

    建筑工程部制定技术措施
    预计下半年可以节约钢筋近一万吨
    新华社26日讯　建筑工程部制定技术措施，预计在今年下半年可以节约近万吨钢筋。
    据这个部的九个直属单位中的六个单位统计，今年下半年可以节约八千多吨钢筋。这些钢筋可以供建筑十一万多平方公尺工业厂房的需要。
    建筑工程部今年下半年将在民用建筑工程中大量地用竹筋代替钢筋。只是华北、中南直属工程公司和兰州总公司三个单位，就将在四十到五十万平方公尺的建筑面积上采用这种办法。今年上半年，建筑工程部已经在五万多平方公尺的楼板工程中，用竹筋代替了钢筋。但是，这种楼板究竟能用多少年，还没有最后结论。建筑工程部技术司的负责人说，他曾到广州参观以前用竹筋掺用很少钢筋的混凝土楼板，这些楼板至今有四十多年了，其中有些竹筋完整无损，有些竹筋因屋面漏水，被水浸蚀而腐朽，但楼板还没有坏。为了使今后建筑的工程更耐久坚固，建筑工程部已经采取措施，把竹筋混凝土楼板由平形改为拱形，把大梁下面原来用木条等材料做的轻质隔墙，改为能承受重量的砖墙来代替大梁；在隔墙之间，横架上竹筋钢筋掺用的小梁（每根小梁只一根钢筋）。这样，每平方公尺标准民用建筑用的钢筋，可以由五点七四公斤减到一点三六公斤。研究过这种方法的技术人员和苏联专家认为，这种方法可以使建筑物更坚固，用的时间更长久。因为所有竹筋都涂有生漆或沥青，可以防止竹筋因受潮湿或细菌腐蚀而腐朽。即使几十年以后竹筋变质，建筑物也不会出问题，因为楼板是拱形的，小梁和小梁间距较密，这样比原来用的平形竹筋混凝土楼板承重力大，而且还可以隔音。
    建筑工程部在工业建筑中，也开始用竹筋或竹筋钢筋掺用的混凝土构件，代替非承重的钢筋混凝土构件。例如，天窗侧板、窗台板、暖气沟、阴井盖和一般门窗上的过梁等。
    冷拉、冷拔、冷轧钢筋，是这个部节约钢筋的另一重要方法。直径十二公厘以下的钢筋，经过冷拉、冷拔以后，长度可以延伸出5％，强度也可以大大增加，如果再把绑扎钢筋架的方法改为点焊的方法，就可以比用旧办法节约20％到35％的钢筋。冷拉、冷拔钢筋的设备比较简单，这种方法容易普遍采用。直径十二公厘以上到三十二公厘的圆钢筋，经过冷轧使用，也可以节约30％。
    建筑工程部还制定了节省水泥、木材的措施。据七个直属单位的统计，在今年下半年可以节省六万多吨水泥，两万五千多立方公尺木材。
    这些技术措施，是在建筑工程部最近召开的技术交流会议上以及会后确定的。这个部强调在采用这些措施中必须保证工程质量。
