Xinhua News Agency, London, August 14th: Indian Minister Without Portfolio Menon arrived in London on August 13th to represent India at the international conference discussing the Suez Canal issue.

At the airport, Menon told reporters that India is very concerned about a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal dispute. He said, "We have friendly and close relations with both Britain and Egypt, and belong to that part of the world. We are users of the Suez Canal, and we are interested in a peaceful solution."

He added: "We are here to work with twenty-one other countries to help find a solution to this problem. People always approach these issues with the view of contributing to finding a solution."

When asked by a reporter whether the Suez Canal issue should be brought to the United Nations, Menon replied that he could not comment on that, because all issues can be brought to the world organization at some point.

The reporter then asked what would happen if the London conference failed to find a solution. He replied: "This is not the attitude one should have when dealing with the problem. We must approach this issue with the desire and confidence to solve it, and if one method fails, we should try another."

Menon also said that before arriving in London, he had spent several hours in Cairo discussing the situation with President Nasser.

    印度代表梅农到达伦敦出席国际会议
    主张和平解决苏彝士运河问题
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：印度不管部长梅农八月十三日到达伦敦，代表印度出席讨论苏彝士运河问题的国际会议。
    梅农在机场上对记者表示，印度很关切苏彝士运河争端的和平解决。他说，“我们对英国和埃及都有友好的密切的关系，并且属于世界的那一部分。我们是苏彝士运河的使用者，我们对和平解决感到兴趣。”
    他又说：“我们到这里来是要和其他二十一个国家一起帮助寻觅解决这个问题的办法的。人们对待这些问题总是本着对谋求解决办法出一点贡献的见解。”
    记者问他认为苏彝士运河问题应否提到联合国去，梅农答说，他不能谈这一点，因为所有问题在某些时候都是可以提到世界组织里去的。
    记者又问，如果伦敦会议找不到什么解决办法，情况将怎样。他答道：“这不是对待问题应有的态度。我们必须抱解决问题的愿望和信心去对待这个问题，如果一种办法失败了，我们应该试试别的办法。”
    梅农还说，他到伦敦以前，曾经在开罗和纳赛尔总统就局势问题谈了好几个钟头。
