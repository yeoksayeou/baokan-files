    A Theater Ticket
    Hua Lu
    Chief Gao, bursting with imposing manner, propped his left hand on his waist, held a theater ticket in his right, and strode into the General Affairs Office with his shirt open, cutting right to the chase: "What are you people doing?"
    Little Li was completely baffled, hastily stopped writing, stood up respectfully, and hesitantly replied, "Chief, what's the matter?"
    "Do you know how much the masses disapprove of you?"
    "We don't know what they disapprove of us for!" Little Li lowered his head, eyes glancing furtively, muttering under his breath.
    "I'm asking you! What principles did you use to distribute the theater tickets?"
    "Our distribution principle is: 'Good tickets are shared, bad tickets are shared equally.'"
    "Absurd! We are a respectable agency, who wants his bad tickets, take it back!"
    "Chief, we can't return them! Theater tickets are non-refundable once they leave the office. Everyone wants to buy tickets for 'Fifteen Strings of Cash,' it's impossible for them all to be good tickets. Honestly, we're lucky."
    "Since we're lucky, then tell me honestly, what's your opinion of our Secretary Section?"
    "Chief, what are you talking about? I've never had any opinion!"
    "If you have no opinion, why did you give the bad tickets to our Secretary Section?"
    "Heaven knows! Honestly, it's justifiable. Your Secretary Section only has ten comrades, but you got nine good tickets and only one slightly bad one."
    "Good?--" Chief Gao flung the ticket onto the table -- "I'm not watching it, give me my money back."
    The truth came out, Chief Gao's outburst of anger was all about this one theater ticket. As the saying goes, even heroes fear unreasonable people, Little Li knew that reasoning with him on these matters was futile, so he quickly exchanged it for a seat in the middle of the third row.
    Chief Gao's face changed instantly, from black to green, from green to purple, from purple to red, from anger to a smile, glanced at Little Li, nodded twice, and then put on an air of slight praise, some sympathy, and some admonition, using the same tone: "Young man! Pay more attention to these things in your work in the future."
    Little Li opened his mouth in astonishment: "Ah!..."

    一张戏票
    华麓
    气势汹汹的高科长，左手撑腰，右手拿着戏票，敞衣露怀地闯进总务室，二话不说，劈头就问：“你们是怎样搞的？”
    弄得小李丈二和尚摸不着头脑，赶忙停下笔，恭敬地站起来，迟疑地回答：“科长，什么事呢？”
    ——你们晓得群众对你们的意见有多大？
    ——不晓得对我们有什么意见啊！小李低着头，眼睛偷偷地瞟了一下，嘴里嘀咕咕地说。
    ——我问你们！你们按什么原则分配戏票的？
    ——我们分配的原则：按“好票共享，坏票平均负担”。
    ——岂有此理，我们堂堂一个机关，谁要他的坏票，退他去！。
    ——科长，不能退呀！戏票出门，概不退换。你想各单位都要买“十五贯”戏票，不可能全部都是好票，讲起来，我们都算幸运的了。
    ——既然我们幸运了，那你坦白地说，对我们秘书科有什么意见？
    ——科长，这话从何说起，我何曾有意见呢？
    ——既然没有意见，为什么发坏票给我们秘书科呢？
    ——天晓得！凭良心说也讲得过去，你们秘书科只十位同志，而票却有九张好的只一张稍为坏点。
    ——好吗？——高科长顺手将票往桌上一甩——我不看了，退我的钱。
    真象大白了，高科长这一顿无明火牢骚，全为了他这一张戏票。常言道，好汉怕赖汉，小李知道在这些事情上同他讲道理也讲不清，就连忙另换了一张三排正中的座位给他。
    高科长脸色顿变，由黑转青，由青转紫，由紫转红，由怒转笑，向小李瞟了一下，点了两下头，然后装出一付有点夸奖，有点同情，又有点教训的面孔，用着同样的调子说：年青人！以后在工作上多多注意这些事情。
    小李惊异地张开大嘴：啊！……
