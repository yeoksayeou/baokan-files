Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 28th. Hebei Province has formulated a comprehensive plan to lead disaster victims in production and overcome famine, based on the spirit of comprehensive planning and early action. On the 26th, Ma Guorui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee at the provincial meeting on production for disaster relief and autumn harvest distribution. Ma Guorui pointed out that, in addition to continuing to strengthen flood control efforts in areas where floodwaters have not receded and doing a good job in rescuing and resettling disaster victims, the following tasks must be carried out at present: First, make preparations quickly and complete wheat sowing in a timely manner. This is an important prerequisite for ensuring increased production and income and shortening the disaster period. The province's wheat fields should be expanded to 40 million mu, striving to reach 45 million mu. In order to ensure planting and harvesting, it is necessary to seize the time to drain water and remove mud, prepare wheat seeds and promote improved varieties, prepare farm manure and supply fine fertilizer, as well as promote close planting techniques. Second, do a good job in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. Continue to organize disaster victims to salvage remaining crops and collect tree leaves, wild vegetables, and other substitutes for food. All land that can be plowed in the autumn should be plowed as much as possible; land that cannot be plowed in the autumn should be shallowly hoed after wheat sowing to prevent wheat yellow dwarf disease and insect pests. In mountainous areas where terraces, beaches, and canals have been washed away, local people should be organized to repair them. Third, immediately start and widely develop sideline production. The guiding principle for developing sideline production is to give full play to the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and the role of various economic sectors, strengthen leadership, specifically organize, arrange industry by industry, profession by profession, point by point, and area by area, combine national key support with the diverse production of disaster victims, mobilize everyone, consider both large and small, open up multiple avenues, offer small profits and large sales, and open up sales channels. According to preliminary plans, from now until next spring, disaster victims may earn more than 100 million yuan from several major sideline productions managed by the province. Fourth, undertake transportation and water conservancy construction projects, using labor as a form of relief. In addition, organize disaster victims with labor power to work in other places in a planned way. Fifth, do a good job in relief work and earnestly solve the difficulties of disaster victims in terms of food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Through vigorously mobilizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-relief and government relief, ensure that no one starves to death. After the autumn harvest, mobilize disaster victims to repair houses, and provide assistance to those who are truly unable to repair them. In areas where houses cannot be repaired before the freeze, take measures such as mobilizing disaster victims to help each other and take refuge with relatives. Before autumn, launch a campaign to collect winter clothing among staff and workers of agencies, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and secondary schools and above throughout the province, coupled with national relief, to solve the problem of keeping disaster victims warm. In addition, appropriately organize rescue medical teams to travel to disaster areas to guide local doctors in providing medical care to disaster victims. Implement reduced or free medical care for disaster victims who are ill. Vigorously lead health work in disaster areas to prevent the spread of disease. Sixth, do a good job in supplying materials to disaster areas. In addition, this winter and next spring, organize 30,000 large carts in disaster areas to engage in transportation, exempting them from road maintenance fees, handling fees, and income tax, to increase the income of disaster victims.
    Ma Guorui pointed out that the flood season in Hebei Province is not yet over, and the disaster situation is still developing in some places. This year's floods covered a large area, and the water flow was very rapid. Some mountainous terraces and beaches were completely washed away, and the houses and trees in some villages were completely submerged, destroying the livelihoods of many people. This year, after agricultural cooperation, farmers had high enthusiasm for production and invested heavily, and a bumper harvest was in sight, but they were suddenly hit by floods, which was a major blow. Some old disaster areas have suffered disasters for years, and new disaster areas lack preparations for overcoming famine, leading many people to be pessimistic after the disaster. There are still large amounts of accumulated water to be drained in the heartland of Hebei Province. These situations have increased the difficulty of production and disaster relief work. Therefore, all localities should start early, redouble their efforts, and treat production and disaster relief as an extremely arduous task for the province. At the same time, with the care and support of the Central Government, the foundation of agricultural cooperation throughout the province, past experience in production and overcoming famine, and the support of non-disaster areas and neighboring regions within the province, various difficulties can be overcome, and the serious disaster can certainly be overcome.

### 河北全面规划领导灾民生产渡荒

    河北全面规划领导灾民生产渡荒
    新华社保定28日电　根据全面规划、及早动手的精神，河北省已经制定领导灾民生产渡荒的全面计划。26日，中共河北省委员会书记处书记马国瑞在全省生产救灾、秋收分配会议上，代表中共河北省委员会和河北省人民委员会报告了这个计划。马国瑞指出，除洪水未落地区继续加强防汛斗争和作好抢救安置灾民的工作外，当前必须作好以下工作：一、迅速作好准备，适时完成种麦。这是保证增产增收、缩短灾期的重要前提。全省麦田扩大到四千万亩，争取达到四千五百万亩。为了保种、保收，必须抓紧排水脱地，准备麦种和推广良种，准备农家肥料和供应细肥，以及推广密植技术等工作。二、作好秋收、秋耕。继续组织灾民打捞残秋，采集树叶、野菜等代食品。凡是能够秋耕的土地，要尽量秋耕；不能秋耕的，种麦后也要浅锄，以预防小麦黄疸病和虫害。山区梯田、滩地、渠道被冲毁的地方，也要组织当地人民修复。三、立即动手，广泛开展副业生产。开展副业生产的方针是充分发挥农业社的优越性和各经济部门的作用，加强领导，具体组织，逐行逐业逐点逐片地安排，国家重点扶植和灾民多种多样的生产相结合，大家动手，大小兼顾，广开门路，薄利广销，打开销路。根据初步计划，从目前到明年春季，由省掌握经营的几种主要副业生产，灾民可能收益一亿元以上。四、举办交通水利建设工程，以工代赈。另外，有计划地组织有劳动力的灾民到外地作工。五、作好救济工作，认真解决灾民吃饭、穿衣、住房和疾病医疗等困难问题。经过大力发动灾民生产自救和政府救济，保证不饿死人。秋后发动灾民修补房屋，对确实无力修建的给以扶助。在结冻前还不能修补房屋的地区，采取发动灾民互助投亲等办法加以安置。秋前在全省专区以上机关、团体、厂矿、企业和中等以上学校教职员中，发动一次募集寒衣运动，再加上国家救济，解决灾民御寒问题。此外，适当组织抢救医疗队，到灾区巡回指导当地医生对灾民的医疗工作。对害病灾民，实行减费免费医疗。大力领导灾区卫生工作，预防疾病流行。六、作好灾区的物资供应工作。另外，今冬明春组织灾区三万辆大车投入运输，免收养路费、手续费和所得税，以增加灾民收入。
    马国瑞指出：目前河北省汛期未过，有些地方灾情仍在发展。今年洪水面大，水流很急，有些山区梯田、滩地完全被冲毁，有些村庄的房屋树木完全淹没，把众多人民的家底毁尽。今年农业合作化后，农民生产情绪高，投资大，丰收在望，突遭水灾，受到很大打击。有些老灾区连年受灾，新灾区缺少渡荒准备，以致不少人灾后悲观。河北省腹心地区还有大量积水待排泄。这些情况加重了生产救灾工作的困难。因此，各地应该及早动手，加倍努力，把生产救灾当成全省异常艰巨的任务。同时有中央的关怀和支持，有全省农业合作化的基础，有过去生产渡荒经验，有省内非灾区和友邻地区的支援等有利条件，各种困难都可以克服，严重的灾荒一定能够战胜。
