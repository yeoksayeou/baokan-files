    Jiangxin Temple (Paper Cut) by Ren Shigui
    The scenic "Jiangxin Isle" in the middle of the Oujiang River is an alluvial sand island. There are two small mountains, East Peak and West Peak, on the east and west sides, each with a pagoda more than twenty feet high on top. The East Pagoda was built in 869 AD (the tenth year of Xiantong in the Tang Dynasty), and the West Pagoda was built in 969 AD (the second year of Kaibao in the Song Dynasty). Between the East and West Peaks is "Jiangxin Temple" (it is said that during the Song Dynasty, the two peaks were separated by water, forming two isolated islands. The east end of the temple is the newly built "Wenzhou District Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Hall"; the west end is "Xingqing Temple". The Wenzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee is located here, displaying more than 3,000 cultural relics such as ancient murals, stone carvings, Neolithic relics from the Wenzhou area, and calligraphy and paintings by famous figures from the Yuan and Ming dynasties. To the east of Jiangxin Temple are the "Wen Tianxiang Ancestral Hall" and "Haoran Tower" (said to be in memory of the Tang poet Meng Haoran). Under the East Pagoda is a Western-style building, which was occupied by the Kuomintang rulers before liberation and forbidden to visit. Now it is a workers' sanatorium and cultural palace.

    江心寺（剪纸）  任士贵
    瓯江中流的名胜“江心孤屿”，是一个冲积的沙屿。东西两边有东峰、西峰两座小山，山顶各有二十多丈高的一座塔。东塔建于公元869年（唐咸通十年），西塔建于公元969年（宋开宝二年）。东西两峰之间有“江心寺”（据说宋时的两峰，隔着一道水，形成两个孤岛，寺的东首是新建成的“温州区革命烈士纪念馆；西首是“兴庆寺”，温州市文物管理委员会就设在这里，里面陈列着古代壁画、石刻和温州地区新石器时代的遗物以及元明名人书画等文物三千多件。江心寺的东首，有“文天祥祠”和“浩然楼”（据说是纪念唐诗人孟浩然的）。东塔下有西式楼房，解放前被国民党统治者所霸占，禁止游览，现在这里是工人休养所和文化宫。
