    Dulles' Curtain
    Curtains generally serve two purposes: they prevent others from seeing us, and they prevent us from seeing others.
    However, the U.S. State Department has created two special kinds of curtains. One kind only prevents others from seeing the U.S.: the "Iron Curtain" and the "Bamboo Curtain." The other kind only prevents the U.S. from seeing others: the "Paper Curtain." The American magazine "The Nation" has given them a name: "Dulles' Curtain."
    The United States is a country that highly values patent rights, but the U.S. State Department has always been very modest in saying that the "Dulles' Curtain" was invented by socialist countries. It is always complaining that the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies created the "Iron Curtain," and China created the "Bamboo Curtain," supposedly to prevent others from seeing the situation within their countries.
    Now, the time has finally come to return things to their rightful owner. This comes after China allowed a group of American reporters to visit China. The U.S. State Department, which has always complained that China uses the "Bamboo Curtain" to block others, did not want to take advantage of this opportunity and refused to allow American reporters to visit China. This incident aroused the indignation of the American press, and the U.S. State Department's old trick of creating "Iron Curtains" and "Bamboo Curtains" was exposed. "The New York Times" revealed that "the Iron Curtain was hung up by the United States itself." The Washington "Star" exclaimed, "Don't hang up the bamboo curtain made in the United States."
    Originally, even without the exposure by the American newspapers, the matter would have been very clear. To date, more Americans have traveled to the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democracies than people from those countries have traveled to the United States. Only the United States uses fingerprinting upon entry to block people. The United States wants to create "Iron Curtains" and "Bamboo Curtains" to prevent the people of socialist countries from understanding the truth about the United States as much as possible. The "Iron Curtain" and "Bamboo Curtain" naturally do not prevent the United States from understanding the situation in socialist countries, because not only do Americans of various social statuses travel and visit socialist countries, but the United States also sends a large number of special agents and spies to these countries.
    From the U.S. State Department's refusal to allow reporters to visit China, people have discovered that there is another curtain in the United States: the "Paper Curtain." This was also revealed by American newspapers. The U.S. State Department's ban on reporters visiting China is a brilliant performance of drawing the "Paper Curtain." With this "Paper Curtain" drawn, the American people cannot see the truth about socialist countries from the newspapers, and can only believe the U.S. State Department's hackneyed propaganda. The American newspapers can no longer tolerate this "Paper Curtain," so the "Christian Science Monitor" has come out and shouted: "Open this paper curtain."
    Who says Dulles has no talent? Look: "Iron Curtain," "Bamboo Curtain," "Paper Curtain," all invented by him alone.

### 杜勒斯之幕

    杜勒斯之幕
    幕，大概都具有两种作用：既使别人看不到自己，也使自己看不到别人。
    可是美国国务院却制造了两种特别的幕。一种是只能使别人看不到美国的幕：“铁幕”和“竹幕”；另一种是只能使美国看不到别人的幕：“纸幕”。美国“民族”周刊给它们起了个名字，叫做“杜勒斯之幕”。
    美国是个很重视专利权的国家，可是美国国务院却一向都非常谦逊地把“杜勒斯之幕”说成是社会主义国家的发明。它总是哓哓不休地抱怨说，苏联和东欧人民民主国家制造了“铁幕”，中国制造了“竹幕”，据说这是为了不让别人看到它们国内的情况。
    现在，总算到了物归原主的时候了。这是在中国容许一批美国记者访问中国以后的事情。一向抱怨中国用“竹幕”阻挡别人的美国国务院，竟然不想利用这个机会，不许美国记者访问中国。这件事引起了美国报界的愤慨，于是美国国务院制造“铁幕”和“竹幕”的老底子就给挖出来了。“纽约时报”揭露说，“铁幕是美国自己挂起来的。”华盛顿“明星报”叫道，“不要把美国制造的竹幕挂上。”
    本来，就是没有美国报纸的揭露，事情也是很清楚的。到现在为止，到苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家去旅行的美国人，比反过来到美国去旅行的人要多得多。用在入境的时候捺手印的办法来挡人家的驾的也只有美国。美国要制造“铁幕”和“竹幕”，就是为了尽可能地不让社会主义国家的人民了解美国的真相。“铁幕”和“竹幕”自然并不妨碍美国了解社会主义国家的情况。因为不但有各种社会地位的美国人在社会主义国家里旅行和访问，而且美国还向这些国家派出了大批的特务和间谍。
    从美国国务院不许记者访问中国这件事，人们发现在美国还有一种幕：“纸幕”。这也是美国报纸揭露的。美国国务院禁止记者访华，就是一场拉“纸幕”的精采表演。拉上这张“纸幕”，美国人民就不能从报纸上看到社会主义国家的真相，只好去相信美国国务院的那些宣传滥调。美国报纸对于这张“纸幕”已经觉得忍受不住了，因此“基督教科学箴言报”出来大叫道：“把这个纸幕打开。”
    谁说杜勒斯没有一点天才呢？你看：“铁幕”、“竹幕”、“纸幕”，都给他一个人发明完了。　（江）
