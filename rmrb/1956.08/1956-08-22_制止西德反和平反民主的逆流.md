When the world situation is definitely tending towards relaxation, the West German militarist forces, colluding with Washington, launched a surprise attack, stirring up an anti-peace and anti-democratic counter-current. The West German Federal Constitutional Court declared the German Communist Party illegal, simultaneously stripped the German Communist Party members of parliament of their mandates, and immediately dispatched a large number of military police, as if facing a formidable enemy, to search the German Communist Party's offices and property throughout West Germany, arresting hundreds of Communist Party leaders and cadres, throwing them into prison, and are now arranging their illegal trials. This long-planned attack by West German reactionary forces is a huge provocation by international war forces against the cause of peace and democracy.

Since the end of World War II, international war forces, especially the American monopoly capital group that is bent on dominating the world, have selected West Germany as the most important base for preparing for new wars, regarded the Adenauer group as their most effective helper, and painstakingly cultivated West Germany into a huge hotbed of war. Since West Germany began to implement the plan for rearmament, the Adenauer government has intensified its persecution of the German Communist Party. It knows that to promote the policy of rebuilding the Hitler's Wehrmacht, which violates the interests of the German nation and the will of the German people, it is necessary to first suppress the German Communist Party, deprive it of its legal status, and prohibit its activities. Because in the struggle of the German people against war, against division, against remilitarization, and demanding the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, the German Communists have always stood at the forefront and are the most steadfast fighters.

In recent years, the international situation has eased, and the idea of peaceful coexistence has become increasingly popular. This has made the international war forces and West German militarist revanchist forces greatly disturbed. They have tried every possible means to reverse this situation that is very unfavorable to them. The Adenauer government's announcement that the German Communist Party is illegal at this time is part of this attempt. They want to intensify international tensions and undermine the trend of peaceful coexistence in this way.

The West German ruling clique's action of banning the Communist Party also shows that they are very unwilling to see the prospect of German peaceful reunification. They are eager to deepen the division of Germany and shatter people's hope of restoring German unity through peaceful consultations, making it a peaceful and democratic new country, and thus eradicating this traditional hotbed of war in the center of Europe.

The action taken by the Adenauer group shows to the people of the world the extreme anti-peace and anti-democratic nature of this group. This group is embarking on the old path of Hitler in 1933. Today, it dares to deprive the Communist Party of its legal status. Tomorrow, it will start to suppress all peace, democracy, and patriotic forces in West Germany, and attack the organizations of the entire working class and the movements of the working people in West Germany. Therefore, banning the German Communist Party is also a signal to persecute all peaceful, democratic, and progressive forces in West Germany, and is a prelude to the restoration of fascist dark rule in West Germany.

However, the Adenauer group's new action of persecuting the Communist Party does not indicate their strength, but on the contrary, indicates their fragility and instability. Recently, the West German people's movement demanding consultation with East Germany to restore German unity, demanding improvement of relations with socialist countries, opposing the "policy of strength," and opposing rearmament has been rising, especially the movement against conscription has developed rapidly, which has greatly alarmed the militarists. They lack confidence in their own rule and feel deeply uneasy about the prospects for next year's general election. Therefore, they decided to eliminate the Communist Party, which is the vanguard of the West German people's struggle for peace and democracy, and eliminate the most advanced forces of the West German people before the Adenauer group's rule collapses, so as to destroy the West German people's movement, in order to consolidate the Adenauer group's rule and force the West German people to accept the division of Germany and the rearmament of West Germany.

There is no doubt that the Adenauer group, by acting in this way, has embarked on a hopeless and dangerous path.

In the history of Germany, from Bismarck to Hitler, there have been more than one precedent proving that using violent means to deal with the working-class movement, destroying democracy, preparing for and launching wars can only lead to a tragic end. And the Communist Party, which is rooted in the working-class movement and connected with the working people, cannot be eliminated. In a country that has given birth to great revolutionaries like Marx, in a place with a long and glorious tradition of the socialist movement, and under the conditions of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, where the German people are their own masters, it is even more impossible to eliminate the Communist Party.

The German people are people with high fighting spirit. They have fresh memories of the Reichstag fire and the disasters brought to the German nation by the Hitler regime. They are increasingly clear that the Adenauer government is following Hitler's old path, and they will never allow the militarist forces to push them into the abyss of disaster again. After the West German Federal Constitutional Court announced the ban on the German Communist Party, a wave of protests erupted throughout West Germany. Many places held rallies of thousands of people to oppose the Federal Constitutional Court's decision and demand the restoration of the German Communist Party's legal rights. This fact shows that the German people are aware of the serious danger contained in this action of the Adenauer regime, they have taken action, and they want to stop this anti-peace and anti-democratic tide.

The just struggle of the German people is by no means isolated, and they have the support of peace-loving people all over the world. We believe that the united struggle of the German people will surely achieve final victory.

In the declaration issued by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party on the same day as the Federal Constitutional Court's verdict, it said: "The German Communist Party still exists and will continue to exist." "Those who judge the Communists today will be judged by the people tomorrow." This firm declaration, like sunshine, penetrates the reactionary haze of West Germany. It will also, like the seeds of spring, take root and grow in the hearts of the West German people, forming a huge force to block the road to fascism and war.

### 制止西德反和平反民主的逆流

    制止西德反和平反民主的逆流
    当世界局势肯定趋向和缓的时候，同华盛顿勾结在一起的西德军国主义势力发动了突袭，掀起了一股反和平反民主的逆流。西德联邦宪法法院宣布德国共产党为非法，同时剥夺了德国共产党议员的委任状，并且立即出动大批军警，如临大敌地查抄西德各地共产党的机关、财产，拘捕成百的共产党领袖和干部，把他们投入监狱，现在正在安排对他们的非法审判。西德反动势力这一蓄谋已久的袭击，是国际战争势力对于和平民主事业的一次巨大挑衅。
    第二次大战结束以来，国际战争势力特别是一心想称霸世界的美国垄断资本集团，选定了西德作为它们准备新战争的最重要的基地，把阿登纳集团看作它们最得力的帮手，处心积虑地要把西德重新培植成为一个巨大的战争温床。自从西德开始实行重新武装的计划以来，阿登纳政府就加紧对德国共产党进行迫害。它知道，要推行违反德意志民族利益和德国人民意志的重建希特勒国防军的政策，就必须首先镇压德国共产党，剥夺它的合法地位，禁止它的活动。因为在德国人民反对战争、反对分裂、反对重新军国主义化而要求建立独立、统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争中，德国共产党人始终站在最前列，并且是最坚定不移的战士。
    近年来，国际局势有了和缓，和平共处的思想日益深入人心，这使得国际战争势力和西德军国主义复仇势力大为不安，他们千方百计地企图扭转这个对他们十分不利的局面。阿登纳政府在这个时候宣布德国共产党为非法，就是这种企图的一部分，他们想这样来加剧国际紧张局势，破坏和平共处的趋势。
    西德统治集团采取禁止共产党的行动，还说明他们非常不愿意看到德国和平统一的前景。他们急于要加深德国的分裂，粉碎人们对于通过和平协商办法恢复德国统一、使它成为一个和平民主的新国家、从而根除欧洲中心这个传统的战争温床的希望。
    阿登纳集团采取的这个行动，向全世界人民表明了这个集团的极端反和平反民主的性质，这个集团正在走上1933年希特勒的老路。今天它敢于剥夺共产党的合法地位，明天它就会动手镇压西德一切和平、民主和爱国的力量，打击西德整个工人阶级的组织和劳动人民的运动。因此，取缔德国共产党，也就是要在西德迫害一切和平民主和进步力量的信号，是在西德恢复法西斯黑暗统治的前奏。
    但是，阿登纳集团迫害共产党这一新行动，决不表示他们的强大，相反地表示了他们的脆弱和不稳。最近以来，西德人民要求同东德协商恢复德国的统一、要求改善同社会主义国家的关系、反对“实力地位政策”、反对重新武装的运动日益高涨，特别是反对征兵的运动迅速发展，这使得军国主义分子大为惊慌起来。他们对自己的统治缺乏信心，对明年大选的前景深感不安。因此，他们决定在阿登纳集团的统治还没有垮台以前，就来消灭作为西德人民争取和平民主的先锋的共产党，清除西德人民最先进的力量，这样来摧毁西德的人民运动，以便巩固阿登纳集团的统治，并强使西德人民接受德国的分裂和西德的重新武装。
    毫无疑问的，阿登纳集团这样行动的时候，却使自己走上了一条无望和危险的道路。
    在德国的历史上，从俾斯麦到希特勒，已经有过不只一个先例，证明用强暴的手段来对付工人阶级运动，摧残民主，准备和发动战争，只能够得到可悲的下场。而生根于工人阶级运动、同劳动人民血肉相连的共产党是消灭不掉的。在诞生了像马克思这样伟大的革命家的国家里，在拥有悠久和光辉的社会主义运动的传统的地方，在成立了德国人民自己当家作主的德意志民主共和国的条件下，要消灭共产党是更加办不到的事情。
    德国人民是具有高昂战斗精神的人民。他们对国会纵火案和希特勒政权给德国民族招来的灾难记忆犹新。他们愈来愈看清楚阿登纳政府正在走着希特勒的老路，他们决不会容许军国主义势力再一次把他们推入灾难的深渊。在西德联邦宪法法院宣布禁止德国共产党之后，西德各地就发出了一片抗议的呼声，许多地方举行了几千几万人的集会，反对联邦宪法法院的判决，要求恢复德国共产党的合法权利。这个事实说明，德国人民是认识到阿登纳政权这一行动所包含的严重危险的，他们已经行动起来了，他们要制止这个反和平、反民主的逆流。
    德国人民的正义斗争决不是孤立的，他们得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持。我们相信，德国人民团结一致的斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    在联邦宪法法院宣判的同一天，德国共产党中央委员会发表的宣言中说：“德国共产党仍然存在，并且将继续存在下去。”“那些在今天判决共产党人的人，在明天将受到人民的判决。”这一坚定的宣言像阳光一样穿过西德反动的阴霾。它也将像春天的种子一样，在西德人民的心中生根滋长，形成一股巨大的力量，堵塞住法西斯主义和战争的道路。
