Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th. Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, is rushing to treat agricultural production cooperative members infected with acute schistosomiasis. Senior clinical physicians from the Jiangsu Provincial Institute for the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis and professors from Jiangsu Medical College have also gone to the site to provide medical guidance.

This past April and May, some members of agricultural production cooperatives in Wu'an, Cheluo, and other townships in Gaoyou County went to the reed marshes of Xinmin Township on the shores of Gaoyou Lake to collect green manure. There, everyone worked in the water for several days in a row. Because that area was originally an area where schistosomiasis was prevalent, many people became infected with the disease after returning. According to statistics, 381 of the 3,611 people who went to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer were infected with this disease. Some agricultural production cooperatives have been affected in their production due to the large number of members falling ill.

After the acute schistosomiasis infection incident occurred, the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province issued instructions to all counties, requiring them to carry out widespread publicity and education throughout the entire prefecture, do a good job in personal protection, and avoid contact with river water containing cercariae. Xinmin Township was sealed off as an epidemic area, and farmers were forbidden to go there to cut grass again. Forces were organized to actively rescue and treat the patients who had been found. The Gaoyou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also convened a meeting of the party general branch secretaries of various townships and towns to examine the past tendency of only paying attention to production and not paying attention to disease prevention, and decided to carry out rescue treatment of acutely infected patients in a short period of time. The Civil Affairs Section and the Grain Bureau of the County People's Committee also allocated a relief fund of 1,000 yuan and 6,000 jin of rice to solve the current difficulties in the patients' food, medical expenses, and grain supply.

    高邮县急救感染血吸虫病的农业社员
    新华社南京15日电　江苏省高邮县正在急救感染急性血吸虫病的农业生产合作社社员。江苏省防治血吸虫病研究所的高级临床医师和江苏医学院的教授也到现场去作医疗指导。
    今年四、五月间，高邮县武安、车逻等乡部分农业生产合作社社员为了采集绿肥，集体到高邮湖畔新民乡芦滩上去割草。在那里，大家接连几天都在水中劳作，因为那里原来是血吸虫病流行区，回来后很多人就感染了血吸虫病。据统计，前去割草积肥的3，611人中有381人感染了这种病。有些农业生产合作社因社员发病较多，已影响生产。
    当血吸虫急性感染事件发生后，中共江苏省扬州地委向各县发出了指示，要求在全专区范围内开展广泛的宣传教育，做好个人防护，避免与有尾蚴的河水接触；对新民乡作为疫区封锁，不准农民再去割草；组织力量对已发现的病人积极进行抢救治疗。中共高邮县委员会也召开了各乡镇的党总支书记会议，检查了过去只管生产不管预防疾病的偏向；并决定在短时期内对急性感染的病人进行抢救治疗。县人民委员会民政科和粮食局也拨出救济费一千元和大米六千斤，解决当前病人伙食、医药经费以及粮食供应的困难。
