Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 28th: The Harbin Coal Mine Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry has organized engineering and technical personnel to go deep into grassroots levels to promote advanced experiences, which has led to the solution of some major problems in production. In the past, when the leadership of coal mines organized engineering and technical personnel to go to grassroots mining areas to help with work, they were often not assigned work according to their specialties, and the tasks assigned to them were often limited to inspecting work and offering opinions, rather than specifically helping to solve problems in production. As a result, some technicians felt very distressed, feeling unable to exert their full potential. In order to change this situation and give full play to the role of engineering and technical personnel, the Harbin Administration has adopted the method of forming working groups composed mainly of responsible engineers to go deep into the grassroots level to solve production problems since the beginning of this year. These working groups are generally sent to coal mines with more problems and complex situations to solve a major problem, set an example, and then use the method of running training classes to promote it throughout the bureau. Therefore, it is easy to achieve good results.

In February of this year, the transportation work of the Didao Coal Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau was lagging behind, which had seriously affected the completion of production tasks. At this time, the Administration sent transport engineer Wang Shiyuan to be responsible for solving this problem. At that time, the cadres of the Didao Mine believed that "there are too few cars and old trams" were the main reasons, so they planned to increase the number of mine cars by 1,037 and the number of electric locomotives by 5. After the transportation professional working group came to this coal mine, with the close cooperation of the mine's leadership, they investigated and studied the reasons for the shortage of cars and made a specific analysis of the use of existing transportation equipment. The results showed that the utilization rate of electric locomotives and mine cars was very low, the allocation was improper, and the transportation organization and technical management were not sound. Based on the specific situation of this mine, the working group helped the mine to promote the advanced experience of the Fuxin Ping'an Mine in reforming transportation, established a dispatching station, and abolished the regulations of each inclined shaft retaining fixed mine cars, implementing centralized allocation of mine cars. After these reforms, the turnover rate of locomotives and mine cars increased by 0.49 times, and the operating volume increased by 39%. The original transportation equipment fully met the needs of coal transportation.

Since the responsible engineers have to personally solve problems in production, their scientific and technological knowledge can also be further combined with practice, and they can creatively exert their talents. For example, when promoting the transportation experience of Fuxin Ping'an Mine in Didao Coal Mine, since the transportation engineers creatively promoted this experience according to the actual situation, only four dispatching stations were established. If it were simply copied, sixteen dispatching stations would have to be established. This greatly saved manpower and equipment.

The Harbin Administration also plans to gradually establish a normal order in basic work such as coal mining, geology, surveying, ventilation, transportation, and mechanization in its subordinate mines through this working group method. Now, the mine transportation work, which was the earliest pilot and has already gained experience, has been promoted in more than a dozen coal mines.

    哈尔滨煤矿管理局组织工程师深入基层
    过去只是去检查检查，提提意见，有劲使不出来  现在直接解决本行专业问题，创造性得到发挥
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　煤炭工业部哈尔滨管理局组织工程技术人员深入基层推广先进经验，使生产中的一些重大问题得到了解决。过去，煤矿领导机关组织工程技术人员到基层矿区去帮助工作的时候，经常不是按照他们的专业来分配工作，交给他们的任务也往往只限于检查工作提提意见，而不是具体帮助解决生产中的问题。因此，有些技术人员感到很苦恼，觉得有劲使不出来。为了改变这种情况，充分发挥工程技术人员的作用，今年以来哈尔滨管理局采取了由各专责工程师为主组成推广先进经验的工作组的方法，深入基层解决生产中的问题。这些工作组一般地是被派到问题较多、情况复杂的煤矿去解决某项重大问题，作出榜样，然后采用开办训练班的办法，向全局推广。因此容易收到较好的效果。
    今年二月间，鸡西矿务局滴道煤矿的运输工作落后，曾经严重地影响了生产任务的完成。这时，管理局就派运输专责工程师王士元负责解决这个问题。当时，滴道矿的干部认为“车皮少、电车老”是主要原因，因此计划增加矿车一千零三十七台，增加电机车五台。运输专业工作组来到这个煤矿以后，在矿的领导上的密切配合下，对车皮不足的原因作了调查研究，对现有运输设备的使用情况作了具体分析，结果发现电机车、矿车的运用率很低，调配不当，运输组织和技术管理都不健全。工作组根据这个矿的具体情况帮助矿上推广阜新平安矿改革运输的先进经验，建立了调度站，取消了各斜井留固定矿车的规定，实行集中调配矿车。经过这些改革以后，机车和矿车的周转率提高了零点四九次，运转量提高了39％。原有的运输设备完全满足了运煤的需要。
    由于各专责工程师要亲自动手解决生产中的问题，他们的科学技术也能够进一步和实践相结合，创造性地发挥自己的才能。例如在滴道煤矿推广阜新平安矿的运输经验的时候，由于运输工程师根据实际情况创造性地推广了这个经验，只建立了四个调度站，如果生搬硬套，就得建立十六个调度站。这样就大大节省了人力和设备。
    哈尔滨管理局还计划通过这种工作组的方式，帮助所属各矿在采煤、地质、测量、通风、运输、机械化等基础工作方面，逐步建立正常秩序。现在，试点最早并已经取得经验的矿井运输工作，已在十几个煤矿中推广。
