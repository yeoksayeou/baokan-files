Some Experiences on Improving Public-Private Cooperation
Chen Hui, Public Factory Director of the Public-Private Jointly Operated Sulun Textile and Dyeing Factory, Jiangsu Province

Abnormal Phenomena

When the public-private joint operation of the Sulun Textile and Dyeing Factory in Jiangsu Province first started, the public and private factory directors generally had a division of labor. However, in daily practical work, many tasks were still the responsibility of the public factory director. The private deputy factory directors neither actively sought work nor were they approached with work. As for documents, important ones that shouldn't have been secret were treated as confidential, and they couldn't see them. General reports or those from lower levels were resolved by the office director (a Party member), and they couldn't intervene. Thus, the private deputy factory directors were left to sit on the "sidelines," dealing only with teacups.

We initially considered this situation a "rule," believing that the private deputy factory directors lacked initiative, and that temporarily sidelining them to establish the leadership advantage of socialism was "reasonable." Later, facts proved this idea to be wrong. At that time, although the private deputy factory directors only did some trivial work, some of it was done quite well, and their opinions in daily meetings were often good. For example, when spinning long fibers, the first deputy factory director, Pu Liangyuan (private representative), proposed "enlarged untwisting and drafting," which solved the problem of yarn quality. When adjusting quotas, he proposed "unifying the speed of roving frames," and the results of its implementation were also good. This showed us that allowing the private deputy factory directors to work would not only not affect the establishment of the leadership advantage of socialism but would also help to give play to the enthusiasm of the workers. Therefore, I realized that letting them sit on the "sidelines" was not a "rule" but an abnormal phenomenon.

Getting Private Factory Directors Busy

From the second quarter of 1955, the factory began to plan the overall leadership work. The first deputy factory director, due to many social activities, shared overall leadership with the public factory director. The second deputy factory director, Liu Wenyuan (private representative), had technical skills, so his main task was to lead production and establish a technical management command system under his leadership. The third deputy factory director, Xu Heting (private representative), had management ability and was in charge of business operations, employee welfare, and daily administrative work. At the same time, some corresponding regulations were made, such as establishing regular meetings, circulating documents, inspecting workshops, and contacting groups. Because many systems clearly stipulated the powers and responsibilities of the private deputy factory directors and helped them solve many specific difficulties, they became busy. Xu Heting, who had said in a meeting of the Democratic National Construction Association group that "the public side is busy, the private side is idle," now didn't even have time to go out to meetings. Once, he received a phone call from outside urging him to attend a meeting, and he asked for leave, saying, "I'm really busy, there are more things now." In this way, they were also very happy. From this, we realized that to transform private personnel into self-reliant laborers, we must make them seriously engage in labor and give them work. This would not only give play to their strengths but also enable them to accept transformation through practice.

Helping Them Solve Difficulties

Solving the ideological leadership problem only solves part of the problem. To solve the problem completely, we must also help the private deputy factory directors solve the difficulties in their work. First, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of "things not being brought to him, and cadres not listening." Workers, according to custom, did not approach them, and Party member cadres were even less willing to approach them. Non-Party cadres believed that they were always "contacting" and "researching" but not solving problems. Except for a few with better relationships who occasionally came around, everyone went to the public factory director, thinking, "The public side has shoulders, and can solve problems with a single word." Based on these situations, we conducted policy education among the cadres, formally announced the division of labor among the factory directors, and explained that the work of the private deputy factory directors was carried out under the leadership of the public factory director and must be resolutely obeyed. As a result, gradually some people came to the private deputy factory directors, and the decisions made were also effective. Liu Wenyuan, after knowing that the Party had mobilized support for the private side's work, said with emotion, "With the support of the Party, I have prestige, my words are effective, but if I can't come up with ideas, I can't lead, I'm really ashamed!"

Another difficulty for the private deputy factory directors was the so-called "not being able to come up with ideas, not being able to lead." In response to this situation, we organized them and the workers to study socialist enterprise management knowledge and let them exercise in practical work, asking them to receive education from production activities, let them preside over meetings, arrange work, help them make plans, think of ways, prepare speaking outlines, and support and affirm their correct opinions at the meetings. For example, Liu Wenyuan, before the joint operation, was not accustomed to speaking at meetings, but now he can independently convene meetings and solve problems.

Continuously Improving Cooperation in Work and Study

Through daily work and study, we require that the ideology and work style of the private deputy factory directors be adapted to the transformation of the enterprise. For example, when we were considering personnel adjustments, the private side had secretly made many "promises," so we seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism. When the thrift campaign started, the first "trick" found by the private deputy factory director was to "cut" worker welfare, and we immediately pointed out that this direction of thrift was wrong. When conducting this kind of criticism, there was persuasion, explanation, analysis, and criticism. At the same time, the public personnel did not simply blame the private side, and they also made self-criticisms of their own shortcomings. From regularly holding ideological review meetings, we developed to conducting criticism and self-criticism at any time during daily office meetings, and formed it into a system. This avoids "settling accounts" and can promptly promote work. However, in order to enable them to systematically receive ideological transformation, regular summary-type ideological reviews are still necessary. In order to unite, educate, and transform the private personnel, we also often combined the inspection of plans, the summary of production, or the regular convening of final accounts meetings and management committee meetings, inviting workers to participate and carry out criticism. For example, at the beginning of this year, when spinning seed cotton, the worker comrades attending the expanded meeting of the democratic management committee raised opinions about Pu Liangyuan, listing several facts and criticizing him for not listening to worker suggestions and not helping to solve difficulties. After the meeting, Pu said to another deputy factory director: "We can't be sloppy in our work in the future. Although there are few public personnel, the masses have many eyes."

Although we have carried out criticism and self-criticism, we have not paid enough attention to encouragement and praise. Later, we found in our work that when the opinions of the private side were supported or when they were praised in their work, they were very happy and worked even harder. This was an inspiration to us, making us realize that realistic praise is necessary. For example, Xu Heting was praised at the cadre meeting after his sense of responsibility was strengthened; Liu Wenyuan was praised for his work in improving the rate of qualified cloth, and he was invited to speak at the mass meeting. As a result, they became more active and willing to work. As for the masses? Because they knew that the purpose of the praise was to work together with the private personnel to do a good job in production and help the private personnel to be transformed in their work, the response was also very good.

Frequently approaching private personnel and fully consulting with them to improve cooperation is also one of the important methods of transforming private personnel. At first, we and the private personnel worked in two different places. In life, although it was not inhumane, there were always concerns. When Pu Liangyuan gave me a Beijing small foreign knife, I went to great lengths to give him money. I thought the method was very good, but the other party, although he accepted the money, was upset for many days. When the board of directors meeting was held in October, in order to entertain the representatives of capital from other places, and also wanted to jointly solve some complex problems in an ideologically unrestricted environment, we lived with the private deputy factory directors for two days. This made them feel: "The public side looks up to us, this is the first meeting where we can talk about anything." Now we realize that harmonious coexistence will be more conducive to the transformation of people.

Preliminary Victory of the Party's Policy of Peaceful Transformation

Judging from the situation of the three private factory directors in our factory accepting transformation and gradually improving the relationship of cooperation, it shows that our Party's policy of peaceful transformation is correct. Originally, among the three of them, only one had a progressive political attitude, and the other two were neither progressive nor backward. Now all three have become progressive elements. Recently, at an ideological review meeting, they said: We have made progress in three aspects. First, our political understanding has improved, and the idea of abandoning exploitation is growing. Second, we are more proactive and active in our work. Third, we have learned some socialist enterprise management knowledge, and our abilities have improved. This estimate of theirs is generally in line with the actual situation.

Their progress is mainly due to the correctness of the Party's policy and the superiority displayed by the joint venture enterprise. Judging from several indicators, the unit consumption of cotton before the joint operation was 398 jin, but now it has been reduced to about 384 jin; the quality of the main yarn has risen from one grade A, five grade B, and one grade C to the current four grade A and three grade B; the rate of qualified cloth before the joint operation was about 96%, but now it has risen to about 99%. These have provided a material basis for us to improve the relationship of cooperation and enabled us to achieve certain results in the work of transforming people. However, due to our lack of deep understanding of the Party's policies, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. In the future, we still need to study seriously, continuously improve our understanding, and, under the leadership of the Party, further improve the relationship of cooperation, strengthen the transformation of joint venture factories and the bourgeoisie, so that the Party's policy can continue to achieve greater victories on this basis of preliminary victory.

    对改进公私共事关系的一点体会
    江苏省公私合营苏纶纺织染厂公方厂长　陈晖
    不正常的现象
    江苏省公私合营苏纶纺织染厂刚合营的时候，公方私方厂长一般都有分工。但是在日常的实际工作中，许多工作仍然是由公方厂长负责。私方副厂长既没有主动去找工作做，也无人找上门。文件呢？重要的一些不该秘密的也当了密件，他们看不到，一般的或者下级的请示报告，都在办公室主任（党员）手上解决了，他们也插不上手。这样，私方副厂长只好坐“冷板凳”，和茶杯“打交道”了。
    我们开始把这种情况看成是一种“规律”，认为私方副厂长主动精神差；而且认为为了树立社会主义领导优势，暂时把他们搁一搁，也是合“情理”的。后来，事实证明，这种想法是错误的。当时私方副厂长虽然只做一些琐碎的工作，但是有些还做的不坏，在日常会议上，他们的许多意见也是很好的。如纺长纤维的时候，第一副厂长浦亮元（私方代理人），提出过“放大解捻牵伸”的建议，解决了纱的质量问题。在调整定额的时候，他提出过“统一粗纱机车速”，实行的结果也是好的。这使我们看到让私方副厂长做工作，不但不会影响社会主义领导优势的树立，而且有助于发挥工人群众的积极性。因而使我体会到让他们坐“冷板凳”，不是“规律”，而是不正常的现象。
    让私方厂长忙起来
    自1955年二季度起，这个厂开始有计划地安排了全厂的领导工作，第一副厂长因社会活动多，和公方厂长共同负责全面领导；第二副厂长刘文渊（私方代表）有技术，确定他的主要任务是负责领导生产，并在他的领导下建立技术管理的指挥系统；第三副厂长徐鹤亭（私方代表）有管理能力，专管经营、职工生活和日常行政工作。同时，相应地作了若干规定，如制定了定期的会议、传阅文件、巡视车间、联系小组等制度。由于许多制度明确地规定了私方副厂长的权责，并帮助他们解决了许多的具体困难，他们也就忙起来了。曾在民建会小组会上说过“公方忙煞，私方闲煞”的徐鹤亭，现在连出去开会也没有空了。有一次外边来电话催他去开会，他要求准假，说：“真忙，现在事体多了。”这样，他们也很愉快。从这里使我们认识到：要把私方人员改造为自食其力的劳动者，必须使他们认真地从事劳动，给他们工作，这样既可以发挥他们的长处，也能使他们通过实践，接受改造。
    帮助他们解决困难
    领导思想的解决，只是解决了问题的一部分，要使问题全部得到解决，还要帮助私方副厂长解决工作中的困难。首先，是要消除“事情不找他，干部不听话”的现象。工人按惯例不找他们，党员干部更不愿找他们，非党干部认为他们老是“联系”、“研究”，不解决问题，除个别关系较好的有时跑跑外，大家都找公方厂长，认为：“公方有肩胛，解决问题一句话”。根据这些情况，我们在干部中进行了政策教育，正式宣布了厂长间的分工，说明私方副厂长的工作，是在公方厂长领导下进行的，必须坚决服从。这样一来，逐渐地也有人来找私方副厂长了，决定的问题也行得通了。刘文渊知道党内动员支持私方工作以后，感动地说：“党的支持，威信有了，说话灵了，就是拿不出办法，领导不起来，真是惭愧！”
    私方副厂长的另一个困难，就是所谓“拿不出办法，领导不起来。”针对这一情况，组织他们和职工一道学习社会主义企业管理知识，并放手让他们在实际工作中锻炼，要他们从生产活动中得到教育，让他们主持会议，布置工作，帮他们订计划，想办法，准备发言提纲，在会上支持和肯定他们的正确意见。如刘文渊在合营前，不习惯在会上发言，现在已经可以单独召开会议，解决问题了。
    在工作和学习中不断改进共事关系
    通过日常工作和学习，要求私方副厂长的思想作风能够同企业的改造相适应。例如：当酝酿调整人事的时候，私方已背地许了不少的“愿”，我们就严肃地开展了批评和自我批评。节约运动开始的时候，私方副厂长找到的第一个“窍门”，是在工人福利上“开刀”，我们立即指出这种节约方向是错误的。在进行这种批评的时候，有说服、解释，也有分析、批判；同时公方人员不尽是单方面的责备私方，对自己的缺点也同样作自我批评。从定期开思想检讨会，发展到结合在日常办公会议上随时进行批评和自我批评，并形成为一种制度，这样免得“算总帐”，且能及时推动工作。但是要使他们能够系统地得到思想改造，定期的带总结性的思想检查还是需要的。为使工人对私方人员进行团结教育和改造，也常结合检查计划、总结生产，或在定期召开决算会、管委会的时候，邀请工人参加，开展批评。如今年春初纺剥桃棉的时候，出席民主管理委员会扩大会的工人同志对浦亮元提出了意见，列举了若干事实，批评他不听取工人建议，不帮助解决困难。会后浦对另一副厂长说：“今后工作马虎不得，虽然公方人少，但群众眼睛很多。”
    我们虽然开展了批评和自我批评，但是对鼓励和表扬却注意不够。后来在工作中发现到：当私方的意见被支持或者在工作中受到表扬的时候，他们就很高兴，工作更有劲。这对我们是个启发，使我们认识到实事求是的表扬是需要的。如徐鹤亭的责任心加强后，在干部会上受到表扬；刘文渊在提高正布率的工作中被表扬，而且请他在群众会上讲了话，结果他们更积极肯干了。群众呢？因为知道了表扬的目的是为了要和私方人员共同搞好生产，帮助私方人员在工作中得到改造，所以反映也很好。
    经常接近私方人员并充分和他们协商，改进共事关系，这也是改造私方人员的重要方法之一。起初我们和私方人员分成两处办公，在生活上，虽然还不是不近人情，但是顾虑总还有。当浦亮元送给我一把北京小洋刀的时候，我兜了好大的圈子给了他钱，自以为方式很好，但对方虽然收下了钱，却懊恼了不少时日。到十月开董事会的时候，为了招待外地资方代表，同时也想在一个思想不受约束的情况下，共同解决一些复杂问题，我们和私方副厂长一起生活了两天，这才使他们感到：“公方看得起我们，这是头一次无话不讲的会议。”现在认识到融洽地相处，会更有利于对人的改造。
    党的和平改造政策的初步胜利
    从我厂三个私方厂长接受改造和逐步改进了共事关系的情况来看，说明了我党的和平改造的政策是正确的。本来，他们三个人的政治态度，只有一个是进步的，另外两个是既不进步也不落后。现在三个人都已变成进步分子。最近在一次思想检查会上，他们说：我们有了三个方面的进步，一是政治认识提高了，放弃剥削的思想在成长；二是工作主动和积极了；三是学会了一些社会主义企业的管理知识，能力有了提高。他们这个估计，一般说是符合实际情况的。
    他们的这些进步，主要是由于党的政策的正确和合营企业显示了优越性。从几个指标来看，单位用棉量，合营前为398斤，现在已降为384斤左右；主要纱支质量从一个甲级、五个乙级、一个丙级上升为现在的四个甲级、三个乙级；正布率在合营前为96％左右，现在上升为99％左右。这些使我们改进公私共事关系有了物质基础，使我们对人的改造工作取得了一定的成绩。但是由于我们对党的政策领会不深，致使工作中还存在很多缺点和错误。今后还需要认真学习，不断提高认识，在党的领导下，进一步改进公私共事关系，加强对合营厂和资产阶级分子的改造工作，使党的政策在这个初步胜利的基础上，继续取得更大的胜利。
