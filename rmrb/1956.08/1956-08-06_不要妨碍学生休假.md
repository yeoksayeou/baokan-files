    In the summer vacation, some schools designate all students to participate in agricultural production cooperatives' labor and arrange a lot of social work; some urban neighborhoods, factories, or county and district leaders also arrange social work for students, requiring them to repair dikes, collect fertilizer, etc., using students as "mobile" labor. This often hinders students' vacations, overburdens them with labor, and even affects their health. The Changsha City Labor Bureau and Education Bureau mobilized more than a thousand middle school students to participate in temporary labor on basic construction sites, resulting in more than thirty people suffering from heatstroke in a single day. This situation is worth noting.
    After a semester of intense study, students should get sufficient and beneficial rest during the summer vacation to improve their health and have more energy to face the new school year. Therefore, all student activities during the summer vacation should serve this purpose. Of course, students can also appropriately participate in production or do some social work, which is not only beneficial to the country's socialist construction but also conducive to cultivating young people's labor views. However, the time should be appropriately stipulated, and students should be assigned appropriate labor or social work. They should not be assigned excessive labor beyond their physical capacity, which would damage their normal development and physical health. Places where this has already happened must stop it quickly.
    On the other hand, in some summer camps or Young Pioneer activities, too much emphasis is placed on education, too many large activities are arranged, or children are required to sit in the classroom every day to read newspapers and discuss, making children very nervous in the summer camp and having very little free time. These limit the children's initiative and also affect their weight gain. This situation is abnormal and should be corrected. In summer camps or other forms of summer activities, students should be given as many opportunities as possible to contact nature and new things. Summer is a good opportunity for students to observe and study nature. It is also suitable for short trips, visits, and familiarizing students with the history, geography, people's lives, and construction of the local area or nearby areas.
    In many places, because of the lack of organization and guidance for students' swimming in the past, accidents often occur. Therefore, simple measures to prohibit swimming are taken. Some places have even publicly issued instructions: "Swimming is not allowed in any river bend, regardless of size!" This deprives those who have the conditions to swim of the opportunity to swim. This is a completely passive approach and should not be adopted. Instead, students should be actively and guidedly educated on safety, and safety measures for swimming should be strengthened to prevent accidents.
    In order to allow students to have a good summer vacation, it is hoped that the Communist Youth League, education administration, trade unions, and parents will all care and create all conditions for students to rest. Since most students temporarily leave school, during the summer vacation, it is even more necessary for all sectors of society to jointly care for the physical and mental health of the younger generation, especially middle and primary school students in cities.
    School student unions and the Communist Youth League can organize collective activities, and can also carry out decentralized small-scale class or group activities according to different requirements. Summer vacation activities should promote the voluntary combination of students with common interests, and there is no need to force uniformity. The content of summer vacation activities should be rich and colorful, but it must be suitable for summer characteristics and suitable for students of different ages and levels. In all summer activities, pay attention to students' health and safety. However, no activity should hinder students' vacations; on the contrary, all schools, institutions, enterprises, and neighborhood committees should create some conditions for middle and primary school students in their units to rest during the summer vacation.
    Half of the summer vacation has passed. In many places, students' summer vacation life is rich and diverse, which is beneficial to students' rest and health. However, judging from some of the above situations, there are still problems with students' summer vacation life. The Communist Youth League, education administration, trade unions, and other relevant parties need to check to see which places have done well, and summarize and exchange experiences; which places have not done well enough, and improve them; and which places have done wrong, and correct them. Only in this way can we effectively help students have a good summer vacation life.

### 不要妨碍学生休假

    不要妨碍学生休假
    在暑假期中，有的学校指定全体学生要参加农业生产合作社的劳动，布置了很多的社会工作；有的城市里弄、工厂或县区领导方面，也布置学生的社会工作，要学生修堤坝、积肥，等等，把学生作为“机动”劳动力来使用，往往妨碍了学生的休假，使学生劳动负担过重，甚至影响学生的健康。长沙市劳动局和教育局动员了一千多中学生参加基本建设工地的临时劳动，以致一天中暑的有三十多人。这种情况是值得注意的。
    经过了一学期的紧张学习以后，学生应该在暑假期间得到充分的、有益的休息，增进身体健康，以便能有更充沛的精力去迎接新学年。所以，在暑假期中，学生的一切活动都应当服从这个目的。当然，也可以使学生适当地参加生产或做一些社会工作，这不仅对国家社会主义建设有利，而且也有利于培养青年的劳动观点。但是，应该适当规定时间，分配给学生适当的劳动或社会工作，不能分配给学生超越了他们体力条件所能负担的过重劳动，损害学生的正常发育和身体健康。已经发生这种现象的地方，要迅速停止。
    另一方面，在有些夏令营或少年先锋队活动中，过分强调了进行教育，安排过多的大活动，或者要儿童每天坐在教室内读报、讨论，使儿童在夏令营中思想非常紧张，很少自由活动的时间，这些都限制了儿童的积极性，也影响他们体重的增加。这种情况是不正常的，应该注意纠正。在夏令营或其他形式的夏季活动中，应尽可能给学生接触大自然和新事物的机会。夏天是学生观察和研究自然的好机会，也适宜于短途旅行、参观、访问，使学生了解和熟悉本地或本地附近的历史、地理、人民生活和建设的情况。
    很多地方因为过去缺乏对学生游泳的组织和指导，常会发生事故，于是便采取了简单的禁止游泳的办法。有的地方还公开发出指示：“不论大小河湾，一律不准游泳！”使有条件游泳的也失去了游泳的机会。这完全是消极的办法，不应该采取这种消极办法，而应当积极地有领导地对学生进行安全教育，加强游泳的安全措施，防止事故发生。
    为了让学生过好暑假生活，希望青年团、教育行政、工会、家长各方面都来关心，为学生创造一切休息的条件。由于学生大多数暂时离开学校，在暑假的一段时间内，就更加需要社会各方面共同来关怀年轻一代的身心健康，特别是在城市的中、小学生。
    学校的学生会和青年团，可以组织集体活动，还可以根据不同要求，开展分散的小型的班级或小组活动。暑假活动要提倡有共同兴趣的同学自愿结合，不必强求一律。暑假活动的内容应该是丰富多彩的，但一定要适合夏季特点，适合不同年龄、水平的学生。在各项暑期活动中，要注意学生的健康和安全。但是，无论任何活动都不应该妨碍学生休假；相反的各学校、机关、企业、里弄居民委员会都应该为本单位的中小学生创设一些暑假休息的条件。
    暑假已经过去一半了。许多地方学生的暑假生活丰富多样，有益于学生的休息和健康。可是，从上面的一些情况看来，学生的暑假生活不是没有问题的。青年团、教育行政、工会和其他各有关方面有必要检查一下，看哪些地方做得好，就要总结经验加以交流；哪些地方还做得不够好，就要加以改进；还有哪些地方做得不对，就要加以纠正。只有这样，才能切实地帮助学生过好暑假生活。
