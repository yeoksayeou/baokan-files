Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th. Recently, many public-private partnership enterprises in Tianjin have provided jobs for family members of private businesspeople who originally participated in auxiliary labor in private enterprises. In the ten industrial and commercial sectors of knitting, cotton, wool and linen textiles, department stores, tobacco and alcohol, and dried and fresh fruits, the number of family members of private businesspeople who have been placed in jobs has reached more than two-thirds of the number that should be placed.

Among those who have already been placed, some have become formal employees of the enterprises, and some are auxiliary laborers. This is based on their past work situation and technical level in the original enterprise. For example, in the weaving and dyeing industry, out of the 107 people who have been placed, 32 have been absorbed as formal production workers, and the rest are doing work such as winding bobbins, making tassels, picking cloth, or cooking. Among the 48 people placed in the sundries business, 20 have been absorbed as formal employees, and the remaining 28 have been assigned to do auxiliary labor.

After the wife of Zhang Zhenyuan, the deputy business section chief of the public-private partnership dried and fresh fruit general store and a private businessperson, was assigned a job, the family's salary income increased by 60%. The livelihood problem of this family of ten was thus completely solved. After the daughter-in-law of Guo Yazhou, the manager of the public-private partnership Yongju Carpet Factory and a private businessperson, was assigned a job, Guo Yazhou's work enthusiasm became even higher. His recent suggestion on establishing workshop production statistics, which has been adopted, enables the factory to grasp the production situation and rework of defective products in a timely manner, improving the quality of the products.

    天津市许多公私合营企业
    给原来参加辅助劳动的私方人员家属分配了工作
    新华社天津30日电　天津市许多公私合营企业最近给原在私营企业中参加辅助劳动的私方人员家属分配了工作。针织、棉毛麻纺织、百货、烟酒、干鲜果等十个工商行业，安排了工作的私方人员家属达到了应该安排的人数的三分之二以上。
    在已经安置的人员中，有的成了企业的正式从业人员，有的是辅助劳动者，这都是根据他们过去在原企业的工作情况及技术水平而安排的。如织染工业行业在已经安置的107人中，三十二人被吸收为正式生产工人，其余的做打轴、打穗、摘布或炊事工作。在杂货商业行业安置的四十八人中，有二十人被吸收为正式从业人员，其余二十八人被分配做辅助劳动。
    公私合营干鲜果总店的副业务股长、私方人员张振远的妻子被分配工作以后，全家的薪金收入增加了60％。这个十口之家的生活问题因此全部得到解决。公私合营永巨地毯厂经理、私方人员郭亚洲的儿媳被分配工作以后，郭亚洲的工作情绪更加高涨，他最近提出并已被采纳的关于建立车间生产统计的建议，使工厂能及时掌握生产情况和残次品回修情况，提高了产品的质量。
