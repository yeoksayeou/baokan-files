Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 19th: Many newspapers in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany have published editorials or carried statements from social groups and political activists, protesting and expressing anger at the West German Federal Constitutional Court's ban on the German Communist Party.

    The "Neues Deutschland" of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that the ban "is a provocation against the cause of peace and democracy, will deepen the division of Germany, and will make the unification of Germany more difficult."

    The newspaper pointed out that if the working people of West Germany acted in unison, and if struggles were launched inside and outside parliament, it would be possible to prevent the West German authorities from banning the German Communist Party. Therefore, the newspaper criticized the West German Social Democratic Party Executive Committee for adopting a "non-interference" attitude on the issue of banning the German Communist Party.

    "Neues Deutschland" finally emphasized that historical experience has proven that a Communist Party that relies on the masses of the working people cannot be eliminated by bans.

    "National-Zeitung" called on all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany to rise up against this reactionary policy of the West German ruling clique.

    "Bauernecho" represents German farmers in opposing the ban on the German Communist Party, pointing out that this tyrannical action is a blow to the cause of peace and democracy.

    In West Germany, Social Democratic newspapers and many bourgeois newspapers have expressed concern about the possible political consequences of this measure by the West German authorities.

    "Der Tagesspiegel" fears that this measure will hinder the reunification of Germany.

    "Bild-Zeitung", published in Hamburg, wrote: "Many people believe that this ruling is politically unwise, while others believe that banning a political party is undemocratic."

    "Morgenpost" said that people should express "regret" about this ban "politically." "Telegraf" also believes that this decision by the West German authorities is "untimely."

    德国舆论愤怒抗议取缔德共
    新华社柏林19日电　民主德国和西德的许多报纸发表社论，或者刊载社会团体和政治活动家的声明，对西德联邦宪法法院禁止德国共产党表示抗议和愤怒。
    民主德国的“新德意志报”指出，禁令“是对和平和民主事业的挑衅，会加深德国的分裂，并且会使德国的统一更加困难”。
    报纸指出，如果西德劳动人民一致行动，如果在议会内外展开斗争，是可以阻止西德当局禁止德国共产党的。因此，报纸批评西德社会民主党执行委员会在禁止德国共产党的问题上采取“不干涉”态度。
    “新德意志报”最后强调指出，历史经验证明，依靠劳动人民群众的共产党是不能用禁令消灭的。
    “国民日报”号召德国一切爱好和平的和民主的力量起来反对西德统治集团的这种反动政策。
    “农民回声报”代表德国农民反对禁止德国共产党，它指出，这种横暴的行动是对和平和民主事业的打击。
    在西德，社会民主党的报纸和许多资产阶级报纸都对西德当局的这个措施可能带来的政治后果表示不安。
    “每日镜报”担心这个措施会妨碍德国的重新统一。
    在汉堡出版的“图片报”写道：“许多人认为这个判决从政治上说是不明智的，而另外一些人认为，禁止一个政党是不民主的”。
    “晨邮报”说，人们应该“从政治上”对这项禁令表示“遗憾”。“电讯报”也认为，西德当局的这个决定是“不合时宜”的。
