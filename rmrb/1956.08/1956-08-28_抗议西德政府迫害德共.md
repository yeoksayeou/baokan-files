    Protest the West German Government's Persecution of the German Communist Party
      The Future Belongs to the People Who Are Moving Forward
    On the evening of February 17, 1933, the news of the "Reichstag Fire" spread throughout the world. The perpetrator of this event, Hitler, immediately declared: "This is God's command, now we must eliminate the communists." Since then, the Hitler fascist gang made a "lifelong effort" to eliminate communists and democratic progressive forces, and launched the Second World War, causing great disaster to mankind. However, Hitler himself went to the grave, and his accomplices were also punished, while the number of communists in the world increased, and the population of countries led by the Communist Party increased from 200 million to 1 billion. The peaceful and democratic German Democratic Republic also stands tall on German soil.
    Today, the Adenauer clique in West Germany has illegally outlawed the German Communist Party. The only difference is that Adenauer is doing it more directly and blatantly, borrowing not God's command, but the so-called "violation of the constitution."
    However, facts will prove that what Hitler failed to do with his "lifelong strength" will be even more impossible for the Adenauer clique to do today, decades after the wheels of history have moved forward.
    The future does not belong to those who are regressing, but to the cause of the advancing German working class.　Central Academy of Drama　Chen Ziyun
          Do Not Allow the Adenauer Government to Follow Hitler's Old Path
    The Adenauer reactionary clique's "sentencing" of the West German Communist Party as illegal is a serious provocation against the basic freedoms of the West German people and will endanger European security and peace.
    German militarism has launched two world wars in less than half a century, causing heavy damage to the people of the world. During the Second World War, the Japanese militarists, colluding with Hitler, ravaged most of China for eight years, causing incalculable losses to the Chinese people. Countless unyielding Chinese people and staunch anti-Japanese soldiers sacrificed themselves, and everyone who is still alive today has tasted the pain of war in different situations. They still remember why they shed blood and why they became disabled. Today, the West German government is preparing to pave the way for re-militarization by suppressing the Communist Party, which cannot but remind people of these years of personally experienced disasters. But now the people of the world will never allow these disasters to poison humanity again. In order to safeguard the peaceful lives of millions of people around the world, and in order to cherish the fruits of our labor created by our own hands, we must not allow the Adenauer government to follow Hitler's old path.　Beijing　Yang Linbo
                A Provocation to Peace and Democracy
    The West German Federal Constitutional Court's illegal ban on the German Communist Party according to the wishes of the Adenauer government is a step towards re-militarization and fascism by the West German government, and an open provocation to the cause of world peace.
    The West German government used the so-called "violation of the constitution" as a pretext when banning the German Communist Party. But everyone knows that this is completely fabricated. For the eleven years since the end of World War II, the German Communist Party has always been the standard-bearer for the West German people's struggle for peace, unity, and democracy. It has waged the most resolute struggle to safeguard the interests of the German nation. Today, the Adenauer government's adoption of measures to ban the German Communist Party fully exposes that the Adenauer government is a deadly enemy of peace, democracy, and German reunification.
    The Chinese people clearly remember that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique also declared the Chinese Communist Party as "illegal" and tried to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party by force. However, the spark of the Chinese Communist Party turned into a prairie fire, sweeping away the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and achieving a great victory. Modern history proves that in this century of ours, no decree or decision can destroy the existence of the working class and the Communist Party, which is flesh and blood connected to it, and no violence can reverse the ever-forward-moving wheels of history. The result of the Adenauer government's ban on the German Communist Party can only be to strengthen the unity of the German working class and strengthen the German people's will to fight for peace, democracy, and unity.

### 抗议西德政府迫害德共

    抗议西德政府迫害德共
      未来属于前进着的人民
    1933年2月17日的晚上，“火烧国会”的消息传遍了整个的世界。这个事件的制造者希特勒立即宣布：“这是上帝命令，现在我们要消灭共产党人”。自此以后，希特勒法西斯匪帮为消灭共产党人和民主进步力量做了“毕生努力”，并挑起了第二次世界大战，使人类遭了大难。但是，希特勒自己进了坟墓，他的帮凶们也受到惩罚，而世界上的共产党人却愈来愈多，共产党领导的国家的人口由二亿增加到了十亿，在德国的本土上也屹立起和平民主的德意志民主共和国。
    今天，西德阿登纳之流，又非法取缔德国共产党，所不同的仅在于阿登纳做得更直接更露骨，借用的不是上帝的命令，而是所谓“违反宪法”。
    然而，事实将会证明，希特勒用了“毕生力量”未办到的事情，在今天历史车轮已向前推进几十年后，阿登纳之流更加办不到。
    未来不是属于倒退的人们的，未来属于前进着的德国工人阶级的事业。　中央戏剧学院　陈紫云
          不许阿登纳政府走希特勒的老路
    阿登纳反动集团“宣判”西德共产党为非法，是对西德人民基本自由的严重挑衅，并将危害欧洲的安全与和平。
    德国军国主义在不到半个世纪的时间内，曾发动过两次世界大战，使世界的千万人民蒙受了惨重的损害。在第二次大战期间，同希特勒勾结的日本军国主义者曾在八年中蹂躏过大半个中国，使中国人民遭受了无法计算的损失。无数的不屈的中国人民和坚强的抗日战士牺牲了，而每一个至今尚活着的人也都在不同的情况下饱尝过战争的痛苦，他们还记得是为什么流过鲜血，为什么成了残废的。而今天西德政府准备从镇压共产党来为重新军国主义化铺平道路，不能不使人们忆起这些亲身经历的灾难的年代。但是现在世界人民决不会让这些灾难再来荼毒人类。为了维护全世界千万人民安宁和平的生活，为了珍爱我们双手创造的劳动果实，我们决不能允许阿登纳政府走希特勒的老路。　北京　杨林波
                对和平民主的挑衅
    西德联邦宪法法院按照阿登纳政府的意旨非法宣布禁止德国共产党，这是西德政府走向重新军国主义化和法西斯化的一个步骤，也是对世界和平事业的公开挑衅。
    西德政府在禁止德国共产党时用了所谓“违反宪法”的罪名。但是谁都知道，这完全是捏造出来的。自从第二次大战后的十一年来，德国共产党始终是西德人民争取和平、统一和民主的旗手。它为维护德国民族利益进行了最坚决的斗争。今天阿登纳政府采取禁止德国共产党的措施，完全暴露了阿登纳政府是和平、民主和德国重新统一的死敌。
    中国人民清楚的记得，蒋介石反动集团也曾经宣布中国共产党为“非法”，并用武力想来消灭中国共产党。但是，中国共产党却由星星之火变成了燎原之势，把蒋介石反动派一扫而光，取得了伟大的胜利。现代历史证明：在我们这个世纪里，没有任何法令或决定能够摧毁工人阶级以及和他血肉相连的共产党的存在，没有任何暴力能扭转永远向前的历史车轮。阿登纳政府禁止德国共产党的结果只能是更加强了德国工人阶级的团结，更加强了德国人民为争取和平、民主和统一的意志。
