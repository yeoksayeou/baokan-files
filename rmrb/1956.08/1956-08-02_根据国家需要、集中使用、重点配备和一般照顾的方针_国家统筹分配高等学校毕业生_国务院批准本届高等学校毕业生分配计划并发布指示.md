Xinhua News Agency, August 1st. The State Council of the People's Republic of China issued instructions regarding the unified allocation of graduates from national institutions of higher learning for the summer of 1956:

I. This year's college graduates, excluding those who graduated during the winter break and have already been assigned, total 62,383 (including 4,138 graduates who were trained by colleges and universities on behalf of various departments, schools, and regions). Based on the principles of national needs, concentrated use, key allocation, and general consideration, and taking into account the principle of aligning learning with application, the State Council has approved the State Economic Commission's allocation plan for this year's college graduates. The allocation plan prioritizes the needs of scientific research, faculty at colleges and universities, and industrial departments (especially foreign design projects); appropriate consideration is also given to other departments in urgent need; and appropriate allocations are made to the needs of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government. When formulating the specific deployment plan for this year's college graduates, the Ministry of Higher Education should, as far as possible, achieve local allocation and local employment.

The allocation of this year's college graduates is as follows:

(1) A total of 15,163 people are assigned to study abroad as prospective graduate students, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Third Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, the Technical Bureau, and graduate students and teaching assistants at colleges and universities, accounting for 24.31% of the total number of graduates, of which 4,932 are engineering graduates, accounting for 22.78% of the total number of engineering graduates.

(2) A total of 15,438 people are assigned to heavy industrial departments, accounting for 24.74% of the total number of graduates, of which 11,412 are engineering graduates, accounting for 52.71% of the total number of engineering graduates.

(3) A total of 8,706 people are assigned to light industry, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, finance and economics, culture and education, and other departments, accounting for 13.96% of the total number of graduates.

(4) A total of 1,651 people are assigned to the People's Liberation Army system, accounting for 2.65% of the total number of graduates.

(5) A total of 21,425 people are assigned to each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government, accounting for 34.34% of the total number of graduates.

In order to take into account the needs of joint state-private enterprises, the relevant business departments in charge of these enterprises should make appropriate allocations from the number of people assigned to them.

II. The original regulations of the Government Administration Council stipulated that "in principle, college students should be assigned work after graduation. If, due to urgent work needs, they must be transferred midway, it should be handled in accordance with the regulations." In the past two years, some departments and schools have not complied with this regulation and have continued to seriously draw college students who have not yet graduated to participate in work without central instructions and approval. This practice not only affects the state's planned cultivation and use of college graduates, but also directly affects the in-depth cultural, scientific, technical, and professional studies of the transferred undergraduates, and affects the morale of teachers and students at the school. In the future, all relevant units must strictly control this.

III. Last year, the execution of the allocation plan by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government and each school deviated significantly from the actual allocation plan, which not only failed to guarantee the implementation of the allocation plan, but also had a certain impact on production tasks. This situation must be prevented. In particular, the contradiction between the supply and demand of graduates is more prominent this year than in previous years, and the number of people allocated to various departments cannot fully meet the needs. Therefore, each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government and each school should conscientiously implement the allocation plan when executing the graduate allocation plan.

IV. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the conference on the question of intellectuals, most employers conducted inspections on the use of college graduates in their units, and put forward improvement methods based on the existing problems, which is good. In the future, each employer and each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government's personnel departments should establish a regular inspection system for the allocation and use of college graduates, and should be seriously responsible for adjusting the unreasonable allocation and use of college graduates.

At the same time, the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government are required to regularly inspect and supervise the allocation and use of this year's national college graduates during the summer, and if they find that there is unreasonable allocation and use, such as using people with skills that do not match the job, arbitrarily changing careers, or demoting them, they have the right to submit opinions on reallocation to the Ministry of Higher Education or the relevant user department or the State Council. If the college graduates themselves who are allocated believe that the allocation is inappropriate or the use is inappropriate, they can also submit opinions on reallocation to the above-mentioned relevant leading organs. This method also applies to college graduates who were allocated in previous years.

V. When handling the allocation of this year's college graduates, the personnel departments of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government can refer to the spirit of the "Instructions on the Unified Allocation of College Graduates" issued by the State Council and other relevant regulations for issues such as taking care of their actual difficulties and whether they are used properly after allocation.

The Ministry of Higher Education will separately notify you of the precautions in the work of deployment and dispatch of this year's college graduates.

VI. The issue of salary treatment for this year's college graduates after joining the workforce will be separately stipulated and will be notified by the Ministry of Higher Education.

VII. The travel expenses and various subsidies for this year's college graduates going to their work areas shall be handled in accordance with the "Standards for Disbursement of Transfer Fees for Unified Allocation of College Graduates" issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Higher Education on July 9, 1956.

VIII. The personnel departments of each relevant province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should summarize the allocation work of this year's summer college graduates and send it to the Ministry of Higher Education by the end of November this year.

    根据国家需要、集中使用、重点配备和一般照顾的方针
    国家统筹分配高等学校毕业生
    国务院批准本届高等学校毕业生分配计划并发布指示
    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国国务院关于1956年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示
    一、本届高等学校毕业生，除寒假毕业生已经分配了以外，共62，383人（包括各部门、学校、各地区委托高等学校培养的毕业生4，138人）。根据国家需要、集中使用、重点配备和一般照顾的方针，并且考虑到学用一致的原则，国务院批准了国家经济委员会关于本届高等学校毕业生的分配计划。分配计划尽先照顾了科学研究、高等学校的师资、工业部门（特别是国外设计项目）的需要；对其他部门在迫切需要的情况下也给予了适当的照顾；对各省、自治区、直辖市的需要，也作了适当的配备。在制定本届高等学校毕业生具体调配计划的时候，高等教育部应该尽可能地做到就地分配，就地就业。
    本届高等学校毕业生分配的情况如下：
    （一）给留学外国预备研究生、中国科学院、地质部第三局、技术局和高等学校研究生、助教等共15，163人，占毕业人数的24.31％，其中，工科毕业生4，932人，占工科毕业生人数的22.78％。
    （二）给重工业部门的共15，438人，占毕业生人数的24.74％，其中工科毕业生11，412人，占工科毕业生人数的52.71％。
    （三）给轻工业、交通运输、农业、林业、水利、财经、文教等部门的共8，706人，占毕业生人数的13.96％。
    （四）给中国人民解放军系统的共1，651人，占毕业人数的2.65％。
    （五）给各省、自治区、直辖市21，425人，占毕业人数的34.34％。
    为了照顾到公私合营企业的需要，应该由各该企业的各主管业务部门在它分配的人数中，给以适当配备。
    二、原政务院规定“高等学校学生原则上应俟其结业后再分配工作，如因工作急需必须中途抽调者，应按规定规章办理”。两年来，某些部门、学校不遵照这项规定，没有经过中央指示和批准，自行抽调高等学校还没有毕业的学生参加工作的现象仍然是严重的。这种作法不但影响国家有计划地培养、使用高等学校毕业生，同时，也直接影响被抽调的肄业生的文化科学技术和业务的深造，并且影响在校师生的情绪，今后，各有关单位必须严加控制。
    三、去年，各省、自治区、直辖市和各学校执行调配计划的情况，同实际分配计划变动较大，不仅没有保证分配计划的执行，而且使生产任务受到一定的影响，这种情况必须防止。特别是今年毕业生供求矛盾比往年更加突出，分配给各部门的人数还不能完全满足需要，因此，各省、自治区、直辖市和各学校在执行毕业生调配计划的时候，应该切实按照计划执行调配。
    四、中共中央召开知识分子问题会议以后，多数用人部门对本单位高等学校毕业生的使用情况进行了检查，并且根据当前存在的问题，提出了改进办法，这是好的。今后，各用人部门和各省、自治区、直辖市人事部门对高等学校毕业生的分配和使用，应该建立经常的检查制度，对高等学校毕业生分配和使用不合理的现象，应该认真负责地给予调整。
    同时，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会对本届暑期全国高等学校毕业生的分配和使用，经常予以检查和监督，如果发现有分配和使用不合理，如学非所用、任意改行或降级使用等情况的时候，有权向高等教育部或者有关使用部门或者国务院提出重新调配的意见。被分配的高等学校毕业生本人如认为分配不当或者使用不当的时候，亦同样可以向上述各有关领导机关提出重新分配工作的意见。这一办法同样适用于前几年分配的高等学校毕业生。
    五、各省、自治区、直辖市人事部门在处理本届高等学校毕业生分配工作的时候，对于他们实际困难的照顾和分配工作后是否使用得当等问题，可以参照本院以前颁发的“关于高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示”的精神及其他有关规定办理。
    有关本届高等学校毕业生的调配、派遣等工作中的注意事项，另由高等教育部通知。
    六、关于本届高等学校毕业生参加工作后的工资待遇问题，另有规定，将由高等教育部通知。
    七、本届高等学校毕业生前往工作地区的旅费和各种补助费，按照财政部、高等教育部1956年7月9日颁发的“关于高等学校毕业生统一分配工作调遣费开支标准”的规定办理。
    八、各有关省、自治区、直辖市人事部门，应该就今年暑假高等学校毕业生的分配工作作出总结，在本年11月底送高等教育部。
            总理　周恩来
               1956年7月31日
