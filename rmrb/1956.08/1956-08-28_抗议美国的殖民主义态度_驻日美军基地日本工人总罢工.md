　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 27th: Approximately 140,000 Japanese workers employed at U.S. military bases throughout Japan began a 24-hour general strike this morning to vehemently protest the U.S. military's oppressive labor regulations against Japanese workers.

　　The strikers include military machinery maintenance workers at various bases, unloading workers at naval bases, employees of U.S. military institutions, and maids in U.S. military residences. This general strike has severely impacted the operations of all U.S. military bases and institutions in Japan.

　　A union spokesperson stated that the labor regulations opposed by Japanese workers are a typical example of the United States treating Japanese people with a colonialist attitude. According to this regulation, the U.S. military authorities can arbitrarily dismiss Japanese workers on the pretext of three absences, three instances of work "laxity," or three instances of broken tools. The workers demand the revocation of this regulation and the signing of new and reasonable labor contracts.

    抗议美国的殖民主义态度
    驻日美军基地日本工人总罢工
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本全国约十四万名在美军基地上工作的日本工人从今天早晨开始举行二十四小时总罢工，坚决抗议美军迫害日本工人的工作条例。
    罢工者包括各基地的军事机械保养工人、海军基地上的卸货工人、美军机构的职员以及美军住宅的女仆。这次总罢工使美国在日本的所有军事基地和军事机构的活动受到严重影响。
    工会发言人指出，遭到日本工人反对的工作条例是美国以殖民主义态度对待日本人的一个典型。按照这个条例，美军当局可以根据工人三次没有上班、三次工作“松懈”或者工具坏了三次为借口，任意解雇日本工人。工人们要求撤销这个条例，另外签订新的合理的劳动合同。
