Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 16th. More than 800 technical inspectors and production workers in 19 state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang have signed inspection contracts. Because of their concerted efforts, they have achieved good results in improving product quality. Among them, 528 inspectors who have made better achievements in the superior product competition have been named excellent inspectors.
    At the beginning of the superior product competition, technical inspectors and production workers in various factories often complained about each other. Workers complained that inspectors did not go deep into the workshop and adopted a "sitting and guarding" attitude to "find fault" with the parts processed by workers; while inspectors complained that workers "emphasized quantity over quality" and had a "breakthrough" mentality. Under this confrontational mood, the inspection work was chaotic, and product quality did not improve quickly.
    The signing of inspection contracts between technical inspectors and production workers started in the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory after the competition started. In order to fulfill the inspection contracts they signed with the workers, the inspectors first changed the "sitting and guarding" attitude of completion and inspection. According to the requirements of production workers, they went deep into the workshop and implemented mobile inspections. They inspected the first part, main parts, and key parts processed by production workers piece by piece according to the process, changing the past practice of blocking defective products to preventing defective products, and reducing the phenomenon of missed and incorrect inspections. For example, the missed and incorrect inspection hours of the High-Voltage Switch Factory in the second quarter decreased from 39 hours in the first quarter to 11 hours.
    Inspectors and workers also jointly analyzed defective products. At present, 18 state-owned machinery factories in the city have established or improved defect analysis systems. When they encounter products or key parts of low quality, they conduct systematic inspection and analysis from technology, processing to technical inspection. For example, the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory corrected the incorrect process documents of the foundry workshop and further implemented the improved process and repair welding regulations, which greatly reduced the reject rate. The reject rate of "double-layer nut" castings alone has dropped from more than 60% in the past to 6%. After the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory implemented more than a dozen systems to improve product quality, such as defect analysis, the reject rate of the factory in the second quarter decreased from 13.9% in the first quarter to 9.7%. Now, a new atmosphere of steady improvement in product quality has emerged in 18 state-owned machinery factories in the city.

    沈阳八百多名技术检查员同工人签订工检合同
    为及时找出发生废品原因十八个工厂建立了废品分析制度
    新华社沈阳16日电　沈阳十九个国营机械工厂八百多名技术检查员和生产工人签订了工检合同，由于他们同心合力，在提高产品质量上收到了良好效果。其中，在优良产品竞赛运动中做出较好成绩的五百二十八名检查员，已被命名为优秀检查员。
    优良产品竞赛开展初期，各工厂的技术检查员和生产工人们，经常互相埋怨。工人埋怨检查员不深入车间，专以“坐关把口”的态度对工人加工出来的部件“找蹩扭”；而检查员则埋怨工人“重量轻质”，有“闯关”思想。在这种对立情绪下，检查工作混乱，产品质量没有很快提高。
    技术检查员和生产工人签订工检合同，是在竞赛开展起来以后，从沈阳空气压缩机厂首先开始的。检查员们为了实现他们和工人签订的工检合同，首先改变了完工交检的“坐关把口”态度。他们根据生产工人的要求，深入车间，实行了流动检查，对生产工人加工的第一个部件、主要部件和关键部件，进行了按工序逐件检查的方法，把过去堵废品的作法改为预防废品，减少了错漏检现象。如高压开关厂在第二季度的错漏检工时，由第一季度的三十九小时减少到十一小时。
    检查员和工人，还共同对废品进行了分析工作。现在，全市有十八个国营机械工厂建立或健全了废品分析制度。他们遇到质量低劣的产品或关键部件，就要从工艺、加工到技术检查，进行系统的检查和分析。例如沈阳第二机床厂纠正了铸工车间的不正确的工艺文件，进一步贯彻改进后的工艺和补焊规程，使废品率大大下降，其中仅“双层螺母”铸件的废品率就已经由过去60％以上降到6％。沈阳暖气器材厂贯彻执行了废品分析等十多种提高产品质量的制度以后，全厂在第二季度的废品率由第一季度的13.9％降低到9.7％。现在，全市有十八个国营机械工厂出现了产品质量稳步提高的新气象。
