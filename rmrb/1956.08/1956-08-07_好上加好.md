    Good on Top of Good
    The "Langqin" gold pen is a Parker-type gold pen with relatively good quality, and it is indeed popular. Many people in our organization have bought this kind of pen. However, everyone has a common feeling: the nib is still relatively thick, the cap is a bit bulky, the ink absorption is not enough, and the words on the cap and pen clip are too large, making it look not very delicate. I hope that the Qianghua Gold Pen Factory, which produces "Langqin" gold pens, will make further improvements. (Li Yannong)

    好上加好
    “浪琴”金笔是一种派克型的金笔，质量比较好，确实受大家欢迎。我们机关里就有很多人买了这种笔。但是大家有一个共同感觉：笔尖还比较粗、包头还有点笨，吸水量也不够多，包头和笔卡子上面的字都嫌大，看起来不大灵巧。希望生产“浪琴”金笔的强华金笔厂再作进一步的改进。　（李延农）
