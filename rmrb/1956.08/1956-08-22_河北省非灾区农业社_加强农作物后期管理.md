Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 20th. Agricultural production cooperatives in non-disaster areas of Hebei Province are actively engaged in the late-stage management of various crops, striving to overfulfill this year's production increase plan and support disaster-stricken areas in overcoming the famine.

Due to excessive rainfall this year, farmland in non-disaster areas has not only suffered from the loss of a large amount of fertilizer effectiveness, but also has experienced unfavorable conditions for crop growth, such as excessive weeds, hardened soil, and low ground temperatures. In order to promote the normal growth and better maturation of various crops, members of agricultural cooperatives in various regions are actively carrying out late-stage management according to the needs of different crops. Dongguang, Wuqiao, Cangxian and other counties in Cangxian Prefecture have re-applied fertilizer to more than 1.9 million mu of corn after the rain, accounting for 75% of the total corn area in these counties. In addition, about 40% of the corn has been earthed up. In Jiaocheng County, agricultural cooperative members have generally hoed the cornfields three to four times after the rain to increase ground temperature and strengthen drought and flood resistance.

More than 800,000 mu of cotton in Tangshan Prefecture has generally had its top shoots removed. Agricultural cooperative members are now removing the terminal buds. Based on the favorable conditions of sufficient fertilizer and even rainfall this year, the general cotton plants in this prefecture have three or four more fruit branches than in previous years.

In order to promote early maturity of cotton and reduce frost-damaged flowers, many agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also sprayed phosphate fertilizer on the cotton plants. According to statistics from six counties in Cangxian Prefecture and some agricultural cooperatives in Wu'an County alone, phosphate fertilizer has been sprayed on more than 100,000 mu of cotton fields.

    加强农作物后期管理
    据新华社保定20日电　河北省非灾区的农业生产合作社，正积极进行各种作物的后期管理，争取超额完成今年的增产计划，支援灾区生产度荒。
    由于今年雨多雨大，非灾区农田里，不仅流失了大量肥效，而且出现了草多、地皮硬、地温低等不利于作物生长的情况。为了促使各种庄稼的正常生长和成熟的更好，各地农业社的社员们正根据不同作物的需要，积极进行后期管理。沧县专区东光、吴桥、沧县等县已有一百九十多万亩玉米在雨后重施了追肥，占这些县玉米总面积的75％。另外还有40％左右的玉米进行了培土。这个专区交河县的农业社社员，雨后已在玉米地里普遍地锄了三次到四次，以增加地温、加强抗旱、抗涝能力。
    唐山专区的八十多万亩棉花已经普遍打完群尖，农业社社员们正在打顶尖，根据今年肥料充足和雨水调匀的有利条件，这个专区一般棉棵都比往年多留果枝三、四个。
    为了促使棉花早熟减少霜后花，很多地区的农业社还在棉棵外喷施了磷肥，仅据沧县专区六个县和武安县部分农业社的统计，喷磷肥的棉田已有十万多亩。
