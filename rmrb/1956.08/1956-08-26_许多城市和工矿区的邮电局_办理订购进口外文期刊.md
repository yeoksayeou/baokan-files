Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beginning in September, post and telecommunications bureaus in 190 large and medium-sized cities and important industrial and mining areas throughout the country will handle subscription and distribution services for imported foreign language periodicals for readers. This means that the number of regions where periodicals can be directly subscribed to will more than double compared to previous years. Readers in places like Yumen in Gansu, Mangya in Qinghai, and Qamdo will all be able to subscribe to foreign language periodicals directly in their local areas. Xinhua Bookstores in these 190 regions will also handle subscription services concurrently.

In the past, subscription services for imported foreign language periodicals were handled only by Xinhua Bookstores and International Bookstores in 90 regions, with the publications being mailed to readers separately by the Beijing International Bookstore. After this improvement, the vast majority of readers will be able to subscribe locally, reducing the inconvenience for some readers of having to remit funds and send subscription letters to Beijing.

The number of newspapers and periodicals included in this year's subscription catalog has increased from more than 800 last year to 1,037.

    许多城市和工矿区的邮电局
    办理订购进口外文期刊
    据新华社讯　全国一百九十个大、中城市、重要工矿区的邮电局，从九月份开始将为读者办理进口外文期刊的收订和发刊工作。这样，可以直接订购期刊的地区比往年增加了一倍以上。像甘肃玉门、青海茫崖、昌都等地的读者，都能在当地直接订购外文期刊了。这一百九十个地区的新华书店也同时办理收订工作。
    往年收订进口外文期刊的工作只由九十个地区的新华书店和国际书店办理，由北京国际书店总店向读者分别寄发刊物。这次改进以后，就能使绝大多数的读者可以在当地订购，减少了一部分读者向北京汇款函订的麻烦。
    今年编入收订目录的报刊品种，由去年的八百多种增加到一千零三十七种。
