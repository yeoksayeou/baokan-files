I would like to discuss my personal views on the issue of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" from the following aspects.

First, it is necessary to clarify what Marxism, as our country's guiding ideology, actually is.

When people emphasize the contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic circles, they often believe that this "contention" will conflict with our policy of taking Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology. This idea generally stems from the argument that Marxism-Leninism and non-Marxist schools of thought are treated equally. Therefore, it is assumed that the so-called Marxist school is just one of the various schools of thought that coexist, one of the hundred schools. To take the doctrine of one of the hundred schools as the guiding ideology is seen as being clearly in conflict with the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend. In fact, this argument involves a double confusion in logic. Marxism and the individual socio-economic doctrines created by Marxists based on this principle are not the same thing. In specific situations, we can compare Marxist doctrines, such as the theory of wages or the theory of panic, with relevant non-Marxist or even anti-Marxist doctrines. However, the entire ideological system of Marxism cannot be treated in this way. It is extremely fundamental and comprehensive. If we do not distinguish between the principles of Marxism and the individual doctrines of Marxists, it is very easy to confuse the generally so-called Marxist school with various narrow, subservient, and imitative academic factions. Such confusion is fundamentally due to a lack of understanding of the essence of Marxism. Marxism is first and foremost a dialectical materialist worldview. From this worldview, the entire universe is in a relationship of universal connection and interdependence, constantly developing and changing. Human society, then, develops according to the objective laws of historical materialism. The modern socialist movement is the inevitable manifestation of that objective law. The class struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie to realize socialism is simply an effort to fulfill their historical mission. The class doctrine developed by Marxists from this worldview concerns the historical destiny of all mankind and provides a comprehensive and systematic scientific explanation of the class life and class changes in modern society. Therefore, to take Marxist principles or doctrines, which include such content, and compare them with doctrines that only discuss certain natural aspects, especially certain social aspects, thus equating the Marxist school in this sense with this or that faction, is, even putting aside the question of right and wrong, to commit the error of "not knowing the category."

Second, it is necessary to clearly understand the meaning of our country taking Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology.

The idea that it is difficult to implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend once our country has identified Marxism as the guiding ideology mostly stems from the speculation that determining Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology is similar to the imperial dynasties' veneration of Confucianism and suppression of other schools of thought after the Han Dynasty in Chinese history. If we add the aforementioned argument, namely, that the Marxist school is also regarded as one of the hundred schools, the above idea will be further strengthened. Because choosing the words of one school from among the hundred schools as the guiding ideology, that is, venerating the words of one school, wouldn't that be suppressing or repressing the other schools? However, if we recognize that Marxism-Leninism is different from other general academic opinions that establish their own schools on a certain aspect, but is a fundamental and comprehensive ideological system that concerns the historical destiny of all human society and opens the door to all truth, our views and ideas should be different. Moreover, in fact, being the guiding ideology clearly does not mean suppressing other schools of thought. On the contrary, only by allowing the existence of other schools of thought, only by letting a hundred schools of thought contend, can the guiding ideology play its role better and more effectively. We only need to briefly review the process of the creation and development of the Marxist ideological system to easily understand how it opens the door to all truth. The mentors of Marxism have repeatedly explained that their ideological system has three sources: classical philosophy, classical political economy, and utopian socialism. They have also repeatedly stated that every epoch-making new discovery in natural science will bring a new verification and development to dialectical materialism. In the classic works of the Marxist mentors, for example, in Marx's great work "Capital," idealistic theories that completely disregard the facts and specialize in defending the interests of the bourgeoisie are, of course, ruthlessly exposed and criticized. At the same time, however, those doctrines that, although incomplete, reveal some truth about the facts, even if they come from conservative and reactionary authors, are praised "without rejecting words because of the person." Everyone knows that Marx's requirements were quite high and very strict, but many bourgeois scholars have received the "great" honor from him. This not only illustrates Marx's broad mind, but also shows the essence of Marxism: for the cause of human liberation, every bit of scientific truth is precious. True, Marxists only praise and absorb those doctrines that conform to the principles of dialectical materialism and comply with objective laws. Aren't other things that do not meet these conditions criticized and "suppressed"? This should not be understood in this way. No Marxist has ever dreamed of absorbing a ready-made and complete theory from any, even great, bourgeois scholar. Truth is often mixed with non-truthful elements, and the rational core is often wrapped in an unreasonable surface layer. The work of criticism and absorption is almost like sifting gold from sand. If the sand is simply rejected, the gold cannot be found. This is how we should treat the doctrines of various bourgeois schools of thought. Even for those views that take a Marxist stance and perspective, we cannot demand that they are 100% true. They still need to go through a process of repeated discussion, critical absorption, or sifting gold from sand. Based on this point alone, it is clear that our determination of the guiding ideology does not hinder the contention of a hundred schools of thought. On the contrary, the more we allow the contention of a hundred schools of thought, the more we need to have a guiding ideology, which will be further explained below.

Finally, it should be clear what our purpose and requirements are for adopting the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend in academic circles.

Everyone knows that the state allows and encourages us to have opinions or contend with each other in academic circles, not to make everyone's views on every thing and every problem become "that is one right and wrong, this is also one right and wrong," unable to reach a consensus, entangled, and arguing without results; or to contend for the sake of contention. It is definitely not like this. The purpose of contention is to discover the truth, to encourage everyone to work together to discover the truth. Everyone's positions are not entirely consistent, their views are not entirely the same, especially since the existing knowledge bases are quite different, there may be extremely different, even opposite, ways of speaking about the same natural phenomenon, social phenomenon, or other problem. In terms of the universal connection of natural and social phenomena, especially in terms of their constant changes and development, the truth is definitely not something that any omniscient and omnipotent great figure can discover all at once; it requires gathering wisdom, requires reference to opinions from all sides, requires seeking common ground while reserving differences, gradually leading different arguments to a more comprehensive and correct understanding, and thereby arriving at scientific conclusions that are conducive to our social and cultural construction.

But here, in order to prevent the contention from turning into a mixed war of competing to be different, each engaging in sophistry, and each holding to their own views, it seems that those of us who participate in the contention need to gradually improve or temper our character of being loyal to the people's cause and striving for scientific truth. A person who is determined to serve the people's cause with scientific truth, despite being brave in contending for their own opinions, must humbly accept once they discover that the opinions of others are better than their own. In terms of the current actual situation of our society, to achieve this, it not only requires us to possess a certain degree of socialist consciousness, but also requires us to possess a certain degree of cultivation in dialectical materialism. If dialectical materialism and socialism are the main contents of Marxism, then our continued launch of Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education nationwide, while at the same time issuing the call for the contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic circles, not only does not have any conflict, but also has a complementary effect. Only under the guidance of Marxist principles can the purpose of the contention of a hundred schools of thought be well achieved, and only by adopting the method of the contention of a hundred schools of thought can Marxism-Leninism be better developed. Let me say it again here: Marxism-Leninism opens the door to all truth.

    试论我国的指导思想和百家争鸣方针的统一
    王亚南
    我想单就“百家争鸣”这一问题，从以下几方面来说明我个人的看法。
    首先，应当明确作为我们国家的指导思想的马克思主义究竟是什么的问题。
    当人们在学术上强调百家争鸣的时候，常常以为这个“争鸣”会和我们把马克思列宁主义作为指导思想的方针发生矛盾。这种想法，一般是从这个论点出发的：就是把马克思列宁主义和非马克思主义各家的学说同等看待，因而，就以为所谓马克思主义派是同时并存的种种学派之一，是百家中之一家，把百家中之一家的学说作为指导思想，就感到显然和百家争鸣的方针相抵触。其实，这样立论，在逻辑上是二重的混淆。马克思主义和马克思主义者根据这种原则创建的各别社会经济学说，不是一个东西。在特定的场合，我们可以把马克思主义的某种学说，例如把工资学说、恐慌学说等等，拿来和其他非马克思主义的乃至反马克思主义的有关学说，加以比较说明。可是，作为马克思主义的整个思想体系，就不能这么说，那是极其根本，极其概括的，我们如果不从马克思主义的原则和马克思主义者的个别学说加以区别，就极容易把一般所谓马克思主义派和种种狭隘的，入主出奴的学术派别混为一谈。这样的混同，根本就是由于认不清马克思主义的本质。马克思主义首先是辩证唯物主义的世界观，从这个世界观出发，整个宇宙，处在普遍联系，相互依存的关系中，处在不断发展变化中，而人类社会，则在依据历史唯物主义的客观运动规律发展着。现代的社会主义运动，就是那个客观运动规律的必然表现，工人阶级为实现社会主义对资产阶级进行的阶级斗争，无非是在努力完成他们的历史任务。马克思主义者由这个世界观展开的阶级学说，关系着全人类的历史命运问题，对整个现代社会的阶级生活和阶级变化关系，作了全面的系统的科学说明。因之，把包括了这样的内容的马克思主义原则或学说，拿来和其他仅就某一自然方面、特别是就某一社会方面的问题加以论证的学说相提并论起来，从而，把这种意义的马克思主义派和这样那样的派系，等量齐观起来，即使把是非丢开不说也犯了所谓“不知类也”的错误。
    其次，应当明确认识我们国家把马克思列宁主义作为指导思想的含义。
    认定我们国家已经把马克思主义作为指导思想，就难于贯彻百家争鸣方针的想法，多半是由于这样一种揣测，以为确定马克思列宁主义为指导思想，就有类于我国历史上汉代以后各皇朝的崇尚儒术、罢黜百家。如果拿上述的那个论点，即拿马克思主义派也看作百家之一家的那个论点加进去，上面的想法，就更会被强化起来。因为从百家之中挑选出一家之言来作为指导思想，即崇尚一家之言，岂不就是罢黜或抑黜其余的各家？可是，如果我们认清了马克思列宁主义学说，并不同于其他一般学术上的有关某一方面的某一家自立门户的言论，而是带有根本性全面性的、关系着全人类社会历史命运并为一切真理敞开着大门的思想体系时，我们的看法想法，就应当不同了。而且，事实上，作为指导思想云云，显然没有罢黜百家之言的意思，恰好相反，只有容许其他各家之言的存在，只有让百家争鸣，才能更好更有效地发挥指导思想的作用。我们只要简单回顾一下马克思主义思想体系的创建和发展过程，就不难明了它是怎样为一切真理敞开着大门的。马克思主义的导师们，曾不惮反复说明，他们的这个思想体系有三个来源，即古典哲学、古典政治经济学和空想社会主义；他们又还不惮反复表示，自然科学上一有划时期的新发现，辩证唯物主义就要得到一次新的证验和发展。在马克思主义导师们的经典著作中，比如说，在马克思的大著“资本论”中，对于那些完全不顾事实，专门为资产阶级利益辩护的唯心理论，固然是毫不留情地予以揭露和批判，但同时对于那些尽管是不完全但却道出了某种事实真相的学说，即使是出自保守反动的作者，也“不以人废言”地加以赞扬。谁都知道，马克思的要求是相当高，也非常严格的，但却有不少资产阶级学者从他那里得到的“伟大的”光荣称号。这不但说明了马克思的广阔襟怀，同时也显示了马克思主义的本质，为了人类的解放事业，一点一滴的科学真理，都是值得宝贵的。不错，马克思主义者只赞扬并吸收那些符合于辩证唯物主义原则的合乎客观规律的学说，其他没有具备这些条件的东西，不是被批判掉了、被“罢黜”了么？不能这样理解。任何一个马克思主义者，从来也不曾幻想从任何那怕是伟大的资产阶级学者那里，吸收一套现成的完整的理论。真理往往是混杂在非真理成分中，合理核心往往被包裹在不合理的表层里面，批判吸收的工作，几乎类似砂里淘金，干脆把砂否定了，金子也无法找出来。对于资产阶级的各种学派的学说，固应如此看待，就是对于那些那怕是采取了马克思主义立场观点的见解，同样不能要求百分之百都是真理，同样要经过反复讨论的批判吸收过程或砂里淘金过程。仅就这点立论，已说明我们确定指导思想，并无碍于百家争鸣，相反的，愈是容许百家争鸣，反而愈是需要有指导思想，这将在下面进一步交代清楚。
    最后，应明确我们在学术上采取百家争鸣方针的目的和要求何在。
    谁都知道，国家允许并鼓励我们在学术上有所鸣或相与争鸣，并不是为了要使大家对于每件事物、每个问题的看法说法“彼亦一是非，此亦一是非”，相持不下，纠缠不清，争吵得没有结果；或者为争鸣而争鸣。决不是这样的。争鸣的目的在发现真理，在鼓励大家共同努力来发现真理。大家的立场不尽一致，观点不尽相同，特别是已有的知识基础颇不一样，对于同一自然现象、社会现象或其他问题，可能要发生极其相异的，甚至相反的讲法。就自然现象、社会现象的普遍联系的本质说，特别是就它们的不断变化发展的情况说，真理决不是任何一个全智全能的伟大人物一次可以发现无遗的；它需要集思广益，需要参考各方面的意见，需要从异求同，把不同的论点逐渐引向较全面较正确的认识，而由是得出有利于我们社会文化建设的科学结论。
    但在这里，要使争鸣不变成争相立异、各逞诡辩、各执一词的混战局面，我们参加争鸣的人，似乎需要逐渐提高或淬励我们为人民事业效忠和为科学真理奋斗的品德。一个有志于以科学真理来为人民事业服务的人，尽管对于自己的意见勇于争鸣，一旦发现他人的意见胜过自己，一定要虚心接受。就我们社会当前的实际情况来说，要做到这点，不仅要求我们具备一定程度的社会主义觉悟，还更要求我们具备一定程度的辩证唯物主义的修养。如果说，辩证唯物主义和社会主义是马克思主义的主要内容，那么，我们在全国继续展开马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育的同时，在学术上提出百家争鸣的号召，就不但没有什么抵触，还有相辅相成的作用。只有在马克思主义原则的指导下，百家争鸣的目的才能很好达成，也只有采取百家争鸣的方式，马克思列宁主义才能得到更好发扬。我在这里不妨再说一遍：马克思列宁主义是为一切真理敞开着大门的。
