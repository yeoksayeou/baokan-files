Defense Mapping Soldiers on the Summit of the Snow Mountain
Ye Yao

Zhaotong Prefecture is a well-known highland area in Yunnan Province. There is a snow mountain here—Huanghuayaolaobao, which is more than 5,000 meters high. Local people call big mountains "seas," and this mountain is the "sea" among the "seas." A certain defense mapping team came here, and their first task was: to climb this snow mountain for observation.

The snow on the mountain was knee-deep, a vast expanse of white, making it impossible to tell where the gullies were and where the roads were. They braved the snow to climb the mountain. Reaching the mountainside, the air was already thin, and everyone was panting. They had to stop and rest for a while after taking seven or eight steps. Where the slope was steep, they climbed upwards with their chests against the snow. The cotton military uniforms were soaked with sweat, and when the cold wind blew, the outside turned into a sheet of ice, making a rustling sound as they walked, while the inside was still sweating.

Reaching the summit, the snow was even thicker; more terrifying was the fierce wind on the high mountain, which could blow people several feet into the air. They set up tents in a sheltered place, but before long, the tent cloth was torn into strips and pieces by the wind, and even the iron cables anchoring the tent feet were broken. At night, when the wind was strong, they were afraid that the wind would lift the tent up by its roots, so they took turns getting up to hold the tent poles tightly. Pebbles mixed with snow hit the tent with a "patter," and small stones flew into the tent like light rain. The next day, they often found the bedding covered with snow and stones.

The air pressure is low on the high mountain, and the air is extremely thin, with the temperature often below ten degrees Celsius. The charcoal fire doesn't produce red flames, but blue ones. The snow water in the pot was boiling rapidly, but the rice wouldn't bloom; it took four or five hours to cook a meal, and the rice was still not cooked. People had to gasp for breath even when sitting still, and the tent was filled with "ha… ha…" breathing sounds. Many comrades felt dizzy, had tightness in their chests, and felt weak in their limbs, unable even to chop vegetables. Some couldn't eat or drink for two or three days, and even medicine was vomited up. For a few days, the tent was practically a hospital ward. But even so, they didn't lie down and do nothing. They said: "We are here to map for national defense and economic construction, not to recuperate on the high mountain. The Red Army was able to overcome the snow mountain during the Long March, and we cannot bow our heads to the snow mountain either."

They tied a rope to the triangulation station and held onto the rope when working on the station to prevent being blown over by the wind. They discovered that the marker stones buried by the station builders had cracked from the frost, so they decided to rebury them. This might not be anything on a small hill. But here, where could they find solid, large stones to use as marker stones? The summit was full of weathered stones the size of eggs. They searched everywhere and finally found a large stone wall. Lacking quarrying tools, they used axes to smash the stones; lacking strength, they rested after a few blows. Lacking fine sand to make a trough for the marker stone, they went to the river thirty miles away to get sand and gravel, which they crushed to replace fine sand. Lacking cement, they sent people to Kunming to buy it; lacking water, they melted snow water pot by pot; lacking a tin sheet to mix the cement, four people held the corners of the tent cloth and mixed it on top. In this way, they finally buried the marker stones deeply and well, and the newly built station stood firmly on the top of the snow mountain.

When climbing onto the station for observation, people's hands often froze to the instruments; their hands and feet often lost sensation from the cold. Even so, they didn't stop working for a minute.

On the day they descended the mountain, the summit was still covered in heavy snow, the mountainside was drenched in torrential rain, and it was already the third month of spring when they reached the foot of the mountain. A green meadow, a green tree, a village, several farmers plowing the fields… everything was so dear. Two months, how long and how short! On the high mountain, there was only wind, snow, and cold, not a speck of green, not a single live beetle; not a single bird call. Coming down a mountain is like going through the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, from an unfamiliar world into a beloved world. Reaching a small river, everyone squatted down as if by agreement, washed their hands and faces, and drank a mouthful of cool river water, how refreshing! A flock of wild geese flew across the sky, and they also stopped, watching for a long, long time as the geese flew far away to the north…

    国防测绘兵在雪山之顶
    叶遥
    昭通专区是云南省有名的高原地带。这里有一座雪山——黄花药老包，高五千多公尺。当地人叫大山为“大海”，这座山是“大海”中的“大海”。国防某测绘队来到了这里，他们的第一个任务便是：爬上这座雪山，进行观测。
    山上雪没膝盖深，白茫茫一片，看不出那里是沟，那里是路。他们冒雪往山上爬。爬到山腰，空气已经稀薄了，个个气喘吁吁。走七、八步，就得停下来休息一会。坡陡处，他们胸部贴着雪往上爬。身上的棉军衣早被汗水湿透了，冷风一刮，外面变成冰板，走起来哗哗响，里面却还在冒汗。
    爬到山顶，高山上的雪更厚；更可怕的是高山上的巨风，风能把人腾空刮出几丈远。他们在蔽风处搭起了帐篷，不一会，帐篷布被风撕成一条条，一片片，连钉篷脚的铁索也被刮断了。夜里，风大时，怕风把帐篷连根掀走，他们就轮流起来用力扶住帐篷杆子。山上的碎石子和着雪团，打到帐篷上“啪啪”响，小石子打进篷里，像下小雨似的。第二天，常常发现被子上满是雪和石子。
    高山上气压低，空气稀薄得厉害，气温经常在零下十几度。生的炭火不起红火苗，而是蓝的。锅里的雪水早哗哗翻滚了，但米却不开花；做一顿饭得四、五个钟头，饭还做不熟。人坐在那里不动，也要张着嘴喘气，帐篷里一片“哈……哈……”喘气声。许多同志头晕、胸部闷塞、四肢无力，连切菜的气力都没有了。有的两三天不能吃，不能喝，连药吃下去也要吐出来。有几天，帐篷内简直变成了病房。可是就这样，他们并没有躺倒不做事情。他们说：“我们是来测绘国防和经济建设用的地图来的，不是来高山上养病的。红军长征时能战胜雪山，我们也不能向雪山低头。”
    他们在三角标架上拴根绳子，上标架工作时就拉着绳子走，防备被风刮倒。他们发现造标人员埋的标石冻裂了，便决定重埋。这要在小山包上，也许算不了什么。可是，在这里，往哪里找可做标石的坚实大块石头呢？山顶上全是鸡蛋大小的风化石。他们四处找寻，终于发现了一个大石壁。没有采石工具，用斧头砸；没有气力，砸几锤歇一歇。没有作埋标石槽的细沙子，就到山下三十里地以外的河里捞沙石，砸碎了代替细沙。没有水泥，派人到昆明买来；没有水，一锅锅化雪水；没有和水泥的洋铁板，四个人提着包帐篷的布角，在上面和。这样，终于把标石埋得又深又好，新搭的标架牢固地屹立在雪山顶上。
    爬上标架进行观测的时候，人们的手常常和仪器冻粘在一起；手脚经常冻得失去了知觉。就这样，他们也没一分钟停止工作。
    下山那天，山顶仍是大雪纷飞，山腰是大雨滂沱，走到山下已经是阳春三月了。一块青草地，一棵绿树，一个村庄，几个正在耕地的农民……一切一切都是亲切的。两个月，多么长又多么短啊！在高山上，只有风雪，寒冷，看不到一点绿色，一只活甲虫；听不到一声鸟叫。走下一座山，像度过了春夏秋冬四季，由一个陌生的世界走进了一个亲爱的世界。走到一条小河边，大家不约而同地蹲下来，洗洗手脸，喝一口清凉的河水，多么舒展啊！天空飞过一群大雁，他们也要停下来，长久长久地看着大雁远远向北方飞去……
