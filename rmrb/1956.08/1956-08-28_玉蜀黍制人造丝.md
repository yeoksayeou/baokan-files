Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Technicians Peng Peiying, Wang Gongjun, and others from the jointly owned state-private Hua Feng Chemical Factory have extracted a protein called zein from the leftover yellow slurry after corn is used to manufacture starch. This zein can be used to make rayon and various other products.

According to Peng Peiying and others, rayon and transparent paper made from zein have the characteristics of being acid and oil resistant. Zein can also be added to cork shavings to make car cushions or fireproof insulation equipment, as well as some rubber substitutes. It can also replace casein, which is twice as expensive, to manufacture various plastic products for insulation or daily use. The Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Industry Company has already organized relevant factories to conduct application tests of this type.

    玉蜀黍制人造丝
    据新华社讯　公私合营华丰化学厂技术人员彭佩英、王恭俊等，从玉蜀黍制造淀粉以后的下脚黄浆中提炼出一种蛋白质——黍胶质。这种黍胶质可以用来制造人造丝和多种其他制品。
    据彭佩英等谈：用黍胶质制成的人造丝和透明纸有不怕酸不怕油的特性。黍胶质也可以加入软木屑做成汽车坐垫或防火隔热设备，以及做成部分橡胶代用品。它还可以代替价值比它贵一倍的乳酪素来制造绝缘用或日常用的多种塑胶制品。上海市化学原料工业公司已经组织有关工厂进行这类应用试验。
