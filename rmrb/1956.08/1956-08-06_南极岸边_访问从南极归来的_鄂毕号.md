    At the Antarctic Shore
    Visiting the "Ob" after its Return from Antarctica
    By Lu Hao, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union

    After passing the last cliff of the Cape of Good Hope, the "Ob," carrying the Soviet expedition to Antarctica, left the Atlantic Ocean and entered the Indian Ocean, getting closer and closer to the Antarctic coast.

    The blue, clear, mirror-like seawater gradually showed the scenery of late autumn. The "Ob," a huge vessel, seemed to be wrapped in heavy gray fog. The black petrels and wide-winged albatrosses had disappeared, and only lonely seagulls occasionally appeared at the bow. People remembered when the ship reached the equator, like ancient sailing ships passing through this place, some even bathed in wooden barrels filled with seawater. The scorching sun of the African sea had also burned the lips of the sailors. But now, the sea was gloomy and dark, and people put on specially made leather clothes. The wild sea breeze seemed to carry needle tips. The further the ship sailed, the more rapidly the mercury in the thermometer dropped.

    White nights, the sky was always like hazy dawn, faintly shining with a illusory fish-belly white light on the misty sea. The clouds were low, as if they were falling down and connected to the vast ocean. The channel disappeared, and birds had also disappeared. In the telescope, only whales spouting high "fountains" could be seen far away.

    Since Russian navigators Bellingshausen and Lazarev discovered the Antarctic continent 135 years ago, this was the second time the "Ob" had carried Soviet Antarctic explorers to reappear in this place. As the ship approached the Antarctic continent, the vast ocean seemed to be blocked by thousands of icebergs. Some icebergs were blue, their strange shapes resembling a sparse village; some were pure white, like a transparent, bright candlestick; some had light green tops, as if people were wearing short coats. On the edges of these icebergs, penguins with black coats and white bellies could be seen from time to time, swaying their clumsy steps, looking at the large ship passing by their side with surprise.

    Navigating through the layers of icebergs was like walking on a knife edge, fraught with danger at all times. Due to storms and the impact of ice floes, colliding icebergs broke into large chunks of ice, rushing straight down, and could capsize or crush ships in an instant. These treacherous icebergs, changing unpredictably, had prevented more than a hundred expeditions from approaching this 14 million square kilometer continent for more than a century, but the brave "Ob" finally overcame all difficulties and sailed into this land that had been sleeping for tens of millions of years.

    The "Ob" stopped at Depôt Bay, where the explorers wanted to find a place to build a village—"Mirny," as a base for scientific research. But here, thick ice cliffs fifty to sixty meters high separated the continent and the ocean like solid city walls. Continuous icebergs stood beside it, and if a storm came, ice and snow would smash everything. Obviously, this was not an ideal place for the explorers to settle. At this time, people pinned their hopes on the aviation team led by polar pilot and Soviet hero Cherevichny.

    So the cranes busied themselves, and aircraft parts in wooden boxes were hoisted onto the ice floe beside the ship. Mechanics worked day and night to assemble the biplanes. Cherevichny flew it for the first time over Antarctica. The flight was difficult, without maps or stars in the sky. It seemed to be flying slowly and low under the flight equipment conditions of twenty or thirty years ago. The earth was only an endless expanse of white snow...

    The plane flew three hundred kilometers on its first flight. When it returned, Cherevichny reported that nothing but icebergs and glaciers could be seen. The second and third flights still yielded no results, and people waited anxiously day by day.

    The plane finally found a flat area on Haswell Island, 120 kilometers away from Depôt Bay. This penguin-populated flat area was about one square kilometer in size. After Cherevichny brought back this news, Captain Man and the head of the ocean exploration department of the expedition team, Kort, immediately took the plane for a second observation. After several repeated surveys, the location of "Mirny" was determined.

    In order to unload the more than 7,000 tons of supplies needed for "Mirny," the "Ob" had to sail from Depôt Bay to a place closer to Haswell Island. The vast sea was already surrounded by densely packed icebergs. Some icebergs were thirty to forty meters above the water surface, almost standing shoulder to shoulder with this large ship with a displacement of 12,600 tons; some icebergs were tens of miles long from end to end, and the "Ob" leaned against it, like a small boat leaning against a large ship. As the powerful diesel-electric ship moved forward slightly, the icebergs beside it made a terrifying sound on the sea surface, and the sharp, crushed ice blocks rushed over headlessly, and the huge ship trembled. On the sea surface, and at the bottom of the sea, there were reefs everywhere. Although Captain Man repeatedly surveyed the channel by plane, the ship could only grope forward step by step like a blind man.

    This was truly a terrible voyage... The "Ob" bravely and蹒跚 moved forward in the howling sea wind. During this voyage, the rocks at the bottom of the sea suddenly pierced a hole in the bottom of the "Ob," and seawater mixed with ice poured into the cabin. The ship was stuck, and many people rushed to the cabin to rescue this dangerous situation. The ice attacked the ship's hull more fiercely. Sailor Gulechev immediately took off his leather coat, put on a diving suit, and dived into the ice-filled seabed. He inspected the leak and eliminated the obstacles.

    The "Ob" approached the coast of Haswell Island, and the explorers stepped onto the land of Antarctica. Here, everywhere was a deep abyss of snow with large cracks, and the rugged cliffs and vast land were all sealed by a one- or two-kilometer-thick layer of ice. On the deck of the ship, the sound of helicopter engines rang noisily. Boxes of building materials and telecommunications equipment were carried over the icebergs by red helicopters to the base of "Mirny." Cranes hoisted crawler tractors and tractors onto the ice, and the drivers immediately started the vehicles. The vehicles walked slowly on the ice, like skating, and did not listen to the driver's commands at all. The uneven ice road made the vehicles tilt left and right, forward and backward. The rumbling sound of the diesel engine summoned thousands of penguins. They were not afraid at all, and curiously stretched their short necks, instead approaching the vehicles or walking close to the people. At this time, tractor driver Hamar had just come down from the ship. He was driving a truck, and the vehicle made him dizzy. Not far in front of him was a tractor. That tractor sometimes stopped for a long time, and sometimes moved forward a little bit slowly. At first, Hamar thought there was a driver on the vehicle, but later, listening quietly, the tractor's engine did not make any sound. It was automatically sliding on the ice. In an instant, watching the tractor had slid to the edge of a steep slope, seeing that if it overturned, the tractor would be destroyed immediately. Hamar hurriedly jumped down from his truck, strode across the cracks in the ice and snow, and climbed onto the tractor, finally stopping it.

    The tractor had stopped, but its crawler wheels were deeply trapped in the snow, and it could not climb up for a while. Hamar increased the throttle, and the vehicle spewed out thick black smoke, which drove away the penguins surrounding the vehicle. But despite the tractor using all its strength, its track was getting deeper and deeper. The ice, which had seemed as hard as iron, was now as soft as an ordinary snowdrift. Suddenly, there was a earth-shattering roar, and the snowdrift instantly turned into a terrifying abyss. The brave Communist Youth League member Hamar and the tractor all fell into this ice pit fifty or sixty meters deep. No one could rescue him in time, and Hamar's precious life was taken away by the ruthless ice and snow of Antarctica.

    People buried the dead with deep mourning, and immediately threw themselves into the heroic labor of building "Mirny."

    This was precisely the frigid season of Antarctica. The climate was often around minus sixty degrees Celsius, and snowstorms blew almost day and night. They swelled people's faces and bruised their insteps. Especially those who erected power lines, even though they held the utility poles tightly with both hands, but standing at a height of thirty or forty meters, the utility poles were bent over by the strong wind like ripe wheat, and people were blown around like kites. The strong white light reflected by the snow all over the ground stung people's eyes and made them shed tears. Everyone had to wear white masks to work. After a month and a half of hard work, the "Mirny" built on Haswell Island in this snow and ice had twenty-four double-layered buildings. These specially made buildings, some of which were built on thick ice layers, not only had all the equipment for scientific research, but also had heating and hot and cold water in their lives, just like many buildings in Moscow. The Soviet people had already thought of everything in detail for the explorers. "Mirny" was also equipped with a 600-kilowatt generator, which not only gave the explorers light and heat, but also made the powerful radio station closely connect distant Moscow and Antarctica. Every day, the results of scientific research on Antarctica were told to Moscow through the radio station; from Moscow, the cordial greetings of relatives and friends came.

    After the "Ob" had unloaded all the supplies needed for "Mirny," its empty hull seemed to float high above the icebergs. At this time, storms came one after another. The violent storm made the steel masts on the "Ob" emit a sharp sound, and the hawser as thick as a bowl sometimes loosened and sometimes tightened, rocking the "Ob" like a small cradle. The snowflakes falling from the sky and the ice blocks blowing from the mainland were more fierce than the flying sand and stones described in our ancient legends. The large and small icebergs beside the ship surged towards the ship like mountains collapsing. Captain Man stood on the high observation deck, holding a telescope in his hand. Although the dark clouds and the howling wind and snow blurred his vision, his tall body stood there, like a heroic sentinel, vigilantly staring at the sea.

    Suddenly, an emergency order was issued from Captain Man: A storm was blowing an iceberg that was much larger than the hull of the "Ob," and it was rushing towards the hull. The "Ob" had to untie the hawser to avoid this place, otherwise the ship would be crushed to pieces.

    Several sailors ran to the shore, but the hawser tied to the "Ob" was tightly taut at this time. Because the storm blew the ship away from the ice shore, the power of this 10,000-ton ship was now concentrated on this hawser. At this critical moment, no one could untie this hawser, and the iceberg taller than the large ship had already appeared in people's sight. At this time, sailors Grafsov, Gulaulov, and Pleshakov appeared on the bow. They braved the raging wind and snow, risked their lives, and cut off the hawser with sharp axes. As soon as the hawser was cut, the ship immediately left the ice shore. After a while, the large iceberg rushed down with the current and smashed the strong ice rock on the shore like a high-rise building.

    "Mirny" was only the first base established by the explorers on the Antarctic continent. In order to facilitate the explorers to continue to penetrate one or two thousand kilometers into Antarctica to establish a second and third scientific research base, a "Young Pioneer" research station was established not long after, 400 kilometers away from "Mirny." This station was built on a high mountain 2,600 meters above sea level, where the situation was even more difficult than in "Mirny." The air pressure was very low, the air was thin, and it was difficult for people to breathe, and their nostrils would often bleed. Strong people would lose ten kilograms in weight after living there for two months.

    Despite how serious the difficulties were, for the sake of human happiness and to uncover the mysteries of Antarctica, Soviet explorers will continue to penetrate into the center of Antarctica this coming winter. Now, the flights of the aviation team headed by Cherevichny have penetrated 2,700 kilometers into the Antarctic continent, and the Soviet heroes' planes are about to approach the Antarctic Circle, which has never been reached by humans.

    南极岸边
    访问从南极归来的“鄂毕号”
    本报驻苏联记者　陆灏
    经过好望角最后的一块峭壁，载着苏联考察队去南极的“鄂毕号”轮船离开大西洋进入印度洋以后，就越来越接近南极的边岸了。
    蓝蓝的清澈如镜的海水逐渐呈现着深秋的景色。船的四周，迷迷蒙蒙，庞大的“鄂毕号”好像被裹在重重的灰雾中。黑色的海燕和宽翅膀的信天翁已经不见了，只有孤单的海鸥偶然地出现在船头。人们记得当船只来到赤道的时候，像古时候帆篷大船经过这里一样，有人还在盛着海水的木桶里洗过澡。非洲海面的灼热的太阳，也曾经灼伤过航海者们的嘴唇。而现在，海面上郁晦而阴暗，人们穿上了特制的皮衣，旷野的海风好像带着针尖似的。船越往前航行，寒暑表上的水银也越急剧地下降。
    白夜，天空一直像蒙胧的黎明，在浓雾腾腾的海面上，微微地闪耀着虚幻的鱼肚色的光。云层低坠，它好像掉下来似的和浩瀚的大洋连在一起了。航道消失了，飞鸟也已绝迹，在望远镜里，只可以看到那远远的地方有鲸鱼吐着高高的“喷泉”。
    自从135年以前俄国的航海家别林斯高津和拉扎列夫发现了南极大陆以后，这是“鄂毕号”第二次载着苏联的南极探险者们重新出现在这个地方。船在接近南极洲边岸的时候，茫茫的海洋似乎被千万座冰山堵塞了。冰山有的是蓝色的，它的奇异的外形好比一座稀疏的村落；有的是洁白的，很像一个透明的雪亮的大烛台；有的顶上是浅绿色的，仿佛是人穿上了短短的外套一般。在这冰山的崖边，时时可以看到背上穿着黑衣裳和有着白肚皮的企鹅，它们摇摆着笨重的脚步，诧异地望着这大船行驶过自己的身边。
    船在重重叠叠的冰山中航行，就像是人在刀刃上走路一样，时时都危险万分。由于风暴和流冰的袭击，互相碰撞的冰山就碎成大块大块的冰块，急流直下，一下子就会把船只掀翻或压坏。这变化莫测的险恶的冰山，一个多世纪以来，使一百多个探险队无法接近这一千四百万平方公里的大陆，但勇敢的“鄂毕号”终于排除万难，驶进了这块沉睡了千万年的土地。
    “鄂毕号”在德波特湾停了下来，探险者们要想寻找一块地方建立一个村庄——“和平村”，作为科学研究的基地。但在这里，五六十公尺高的厚厚的冰岩，像一堵堵牢固的城墙把大陆和海洋远远地隔离了起来。连绵的冰山矗立在它的旁边，如果暴风一来，冰雪会把什么东西也打烂的。很显然，这里不是探险者们落脚的理想的地方。这时候，人们都把希望寄托在极地飞行员、苏联英雄契列维奇尼领导的航空队的身上了。
    于是起重机忙碌起来，装在木头箱子里的飞机零件被吊到船边的浮冰上去，机械师们日夜地工作着，把双翼飞机装好了，契列维奇尼驾驶着它第一次飞行在南极上空。飞行是艰难的，既没有地图，也见不到天上的星星，它只好像在二、三十年以前飞行装备的情况下，慢慢地低低地飞行，大地上只有无边无际的白皑皑的冰雪……
    飞机第一次飞行了三百公里，回来的时候，契列维奇尼报告说：除了冰山和冰河什么也看不见。第二次、第三次飞行，还是没有结果，人们一天天焦急地等待着。
    飞机终于在离开德波特湾一百二十公里的哈斯威尔岛发现了一块平地。这块企鹅成群的平地有一平方公里那样大。契列维奇尼把这个消息带回来以后，船长曼和考察队海洋探险部负责人科尔特马上坐上飞机去作了第二次观察。经过几次三番的勘察，“和平村”的地址就算确定下来了。
    为了卸下“和平村”所需要的七千多吨物资，“鄂毕号”要经德波特湾开到离哈斯威尔岛比较近的地方去。辽阔的海面上，已经被密密层层的冰山所包围了。有的冰山高出水面三四十公尺，它和这排水量一万二千六百吨的大船几乎是并肩地站在一起；有的冰山连头带尾有几十里路长，“鄂毕号”靠在它旁边，好像是一只小划子靠在大轮船上。这强大的柴油电动船稍许向前走一步，它的身边的冰山就在海面上发出一种可怖的响声，锋利的被粉碎的冰块没头没脑地冲击过来，巨大的船身都震动得颤颤发抖。海面上是这样，在海底里，到处是像刀子似的石头的冰凌地暗礁。虽然船长曼坐着飞机一次又一次的探测着航道，但船还是只能像瞎子那样一步一步地摸索着前进。
    这真是可怕的航行……“鄂毕号”在海风呼啸中勇敢而又蹒跚地前进。正在这航行之中，水底的岩石突然把“鄂毕号”的船底戳破了一个窟窿，海水夹杂着冰块涌进舱里来。船搁住了，很多人赶到舱里去抢救这场危险。冰更猛烈地夹击着船的外壳。水手古列切夫马上把身上的皮衣脱掉，穿上了潜水衣，潜入这浮满了冰块的海底，他检查了漏洞，消除了障碍。
    “鄂毕号”靠近了哈斯威尔岛的海岸，探险者们踏上了这南极洲的土地。这里到处都是裂着大口的雪的深渊，嶙峋的悬崖和辽阔的土地，都给一二公里厚的冰层封闭住了。在船的甲板上喧闹地响起了直升飞机的发动机的声音，一箱箱的建筑材料，电讯器材由红色的直升飞机载过冰山，运到了“和平村”的基地。起重机把一辆辆履带牵引汽车和拖拉机吊到冰地上去，车子马上被驾驶员们开动起来。车子在冰地上慢慢地走，像溜冰一般，根本不听从驾驶员的指挥。那不平的冰路，又使车子左歪右倒，前俯后仰。轧轧轧的柴油机的响声，召来了成千的企鹅，它们一点也不害怕，好奇地伸着粗短的脖子，反而靠拢车子或走近人的身边。这时候，拖拉机手哈玛尔刚从船上下来，他驾驶着一辆载重汽车，车子把他颠簸得头昏脑胀。在他前面不远的地方，有着一辆拖拉机，那拖拉机有时候很长时间停止不动，有时候，蠕蠕地向前移动一点。起初，哈玛尔还以为车子上是有驾驶员的，但后来静静地一听，拖拉机的发动机并没有什么响声，它是在冰上自动地滑行。刹那之间，看着拖拉机已经滑到了一个陡坡的边缘，眼看如果翻下去，这拖拉机马上就要毁灭了。哈玛尔急忙从自己的载重汽车跳下来，他大步跨过冰雪的裂缝，连跌带跑地爬上了拖拉机，终算使它停了下来。
    拖拉机是停下来了，但它的履带式的轮子却已经深深地陷在雪里头，一时爬不上来。哈玛尔放大了油门，车子喷吐着乌黑的浓烟，这把围在车旁的企鹅都赶跑了。但是尽管拖拉机用尽了它的全部的力量，它的轮带却是越陷越深，本来看来坚硬如铁的冰地，这时候却松软得好像普通的雪堆一般。忽然天崩地裂似地一声轰响，雪堆倾刻之间变成了一个可怕的深渊。勇敢的共青团员哈玛尔和拖拉机一下子都掉在这五六十公尺深的冰坑里了。谁也无法来得及抢救他，哈玛尔就被这南极洲的无情的冰雪夺去了宝贵的生命。
    人们怀着深切的哀悼的心情埋葬了死者，马上又投入建设“和平村”的英勇的劳动。
    这正是南极洲的严寒的季节。气候常常在零下六十度左右，暴风雪几乎成天成夜地刮着，它把人们的脸打肿了，脚背也压伤了。特别是那些架设电线的人，尽管两手紧紧地抱住了电线杆，但站在三四十公尺的高空，电线杆被大风刮得像熟透了的麦子，垂下了头，人被吹得荡来荡去，像风筝一般。遍地冰雪反射的强烈的白光，把人的眼睛刺得直流眼泪，大家带上了白色的面罩才能工作。经过了一个半月的努力，在这个冰雪之中的哈斯威尔岛上建立的“和平村”，盖起了二十四间双层的楼房，这些特制的楼房，有的虽然是建筑在厚厚的冰层上的，它不但具有科学研究的一切设备，就是在生活上，它也和莫斯科很多楼房一样，有暖气，有冷热用水，凡是需要的，苏联人民都早已为探险者们详尽地想到了。“和平村”还装备了六百瓩的发电机，它不但给探险者们光和热，而且还使强大的广播站把遥远的莫斯科和南极洲密切地联系在一起。每天，通过广播站把有关南极洲科学研究的成果告诉给莫斯科；从莫斯科，又传来了亲友们的亲切的问候。
    “鄂毕号”在卸完了“和平村”所需要的全部物资以后，它的空空的船身就好像高高地浮动在冰山之上，就在这个时候，风暴又接二连三地袭来。暴戾的风暴把“鄂毕号”上的钢铁的桅杆吹得发出一种尖厉的响声，碗口粗的船缆一会儿松，一会儿紧，把“鄂毕号”颠簸得像只小小的摇篮。天空飘下的雪团和大陆上吹过来的冰块，刮得比我国古老的传说中所描写的飞砂走石还要厉害。船边的大大小小的冰山，山倒般地涌向船边。船长曼站在高高的了望台上，手里拿着望远镜，虽然是乌黑的云彩和呼啦呼啦的风雪模糊了他的视线，但他的高大的身躯站在那里，就像一个英勇的哨兵那样，警惕地凝视着海面。
    突然地从船长曼那里传下了紧急的命令：暴风吹着一座比“鄂毕号”船身还要大得多的冰山，正向船身冲来，“鄂毕号”必须解开钢缆躲开这个地方，否则船都会被压成粉碎的。
    几个水手跑向了岸边，但拴着“鄂毕号”的那根钢缆这时间却绷得紧紧的。因为风暴把船吹离了冰岸，这万吨大船的力量现在都集中在这根钢缆上了。在这千钧一发的时刻，没有一个人可以解开这条钢缆，而高过大船的冰山已经出现在人们的视线内了。这时候，船头上出现了水手格拉夫索夫、古拉乌洛夫和普列沙克夫，他们三个人冒着狂暴的风雪，冒着生命的危险，用利斧砍断了这个钢缆，缆一断，船就一下子离开了冰岸。过了一会儿，那大冰山顺流冲来，把岸边的那像高楼般的坚固的冰岩撞了个稀烂。
    “和平村”只不过是探险者们在南极大陆建立的第一个基地。为了便利探险者们继续深入南极洲一、二千公里建立第二个、第三个科学研究基地，不久之后，就在离开“和平村”四百公里的地方建立了一个“少年先锋”研究站。这个站建立在拔海二千六百公尺的一个高山上，那里的情形比起“和平村”来就更加困难。气压很低，空气稀薄，人的呼吸也很困难，鼻孔会常常出血。强壮的人在那里生活两个月回来，体重就要减轻十公斤。
    尽管困难是多么严重，但为了人类的幸福，为了揭开这南极之谜，苏联的探险者们在今年的严冬还要继续深入到南极洲的中心去。现在，以契列维奇尼为首的航空队的飞机的飞行已经深入到南极大陆二千七百公里，苏联的英雄的飞机已经快接近从来没有人迹的南极圈了。（附图片）
