Column: Reactions to Criticism

    The Remittance System is Indeed Unreasonable
    A letter from the Postal Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications states: We have studied the reader's opinions on postal work published in the People's Daily on July 20th and respond as follows:
    The current postal remittance method stipulates a remittance fee of 20 cents for remittances from 1 to 300 yuan, and a separate registered letter is also required, which is not reasonable enough. We are currently studying the Soviet remittance method and will start a thorough reform of the remittance system.
    The sales method for commemorative stamps and special stamps is the same as for ordinary stamps, with stamps given at face value, and there is no restriction that complete sets must be purchased. Regarding Comrade Chen Kangfeng's reflection that the Beijing Di'anmen Street Post Office requires that commemorative stamps must be sold as a complete set, we have notified the Beijing Post Office to pay attention to correcting this.
    Regarding Comrade Qian Zizhong's reflection that the Qamdo Post and Telecommunications Bureau is not responsible for tracking remittances, resulting in the remittances going missing, Comrade Wang Jingpo's reflection that a brush package sent from Shanghai to Lechang Post Office was returned to the original sending bureau for no reason, Comrade Wang Jianzhou's reflection that the Xianyang Post Office does not value newspaper and magazine delivery work, the reflection from a Chang'an resident that airmail is slower than regular mail, and the reflections from Comrade Yu Zhenhe and others that mail is backlogged and no one cares, in addition to notifying the relevant bureaus to take measures to improve the quality of work, we have also separately notified the relevant provincial postal and telecommunications administrations to thoroughly investigate and deal with the above issues.
    Meetings Have Been Reduced
    A letter from the Zhangjiakou Municipal Industrial Bureau states: The article "A Cigarette Factory That Does Not Care About Workers' Lives" published in the People's Daily on May 27th, criticizing the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory for excessively occupying employees' spare time and for poor ventilation and dust removal equipment, is correct. The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory discussed this criticism and is determined to reduce unnecessary meetings. The first step has been to ensure that meetings do not exceed four times a week and that each meeting does not exceed one hour. If a meeting exceeds the stipulated time due to inadequate prior preparation, employees may freely leave. They also plan to increase investment to solve the problem of poor dust removal equipment.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    汇兑制度确实不合理
    邮电部邮政总局来信说：七月二十日人民日报登载读者对邮局工作的意见，经我们研究答复如下：
    邮局现行汇款办法规定汇一元至三百元一律收汇费二角，还须另寄挂号信，办法是不够合理的。目前我们正学习苏联汇兑办法，从汇兑制度着手进行彻底改革。
    纪念邮票及特种邮票出售办法同普通邮票一样，按面值给票，并无必须全套购买的限制。陈抗风同志反映北京地安门大街邮局出售纪念邮票必须一套一起出售的情况，我们已通知北京邮局注意纠正。
    钱子中同志反映昌都邮电局对追查汇款不负责任，致使汇款下落不明，王景坡同志反映由上海寄乐昌邮局的毛刷包裹无故退回原寄局，王剑舟同志反映咸阳邮局不重视报刊投递工作，长安人反映航空信反比平信慢以及于振河等同志反映邮件积压没人管等问题，我们除通知各局采取措施提高工作质量外，并已分别通知相关省邮电管理局对以上问题彻查处理。
    会议已经减少
    张家口市工业局来信说：五月二十七日人民日报发表“不关心工人生活的制烟厂”一文，对张家口制烟厂过多的占用职工业余活动时间和通风除尘设备不良的批评是正确的。张家口制烟厂讨论了这个批评，决心减少不必要的会议，第一步已经做到每周会议不得超过四次，每次不得超过一小时，如因事先准备不好，会议超过了规定时间，职工可以自由退席。还准备增加投资来解决除尘设备不良的问题。
