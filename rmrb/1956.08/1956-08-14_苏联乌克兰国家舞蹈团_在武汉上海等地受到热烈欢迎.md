The Soviet Ukrainian National Dance Troupe, invited by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China to participate in the closing ceremony of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Wuhan and to visit and perform in various places, has been on a visit to China for more than a month, from its opening performance in Wuhan on July 5th to the present. During this period, the dance troupe visited Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuxi. According to the planned schedule, they will also visit Zhengzhou and Xi'an, and finally perform in Beijing.

The Ukrainian National Dance Troupe is a professional dance group that was established just five years ago, but its programs are very mature and wonderful. The artistic director of the dance troupe is Pavel Virsky, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Honored Actor of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Stalin Prize laureate. The director is Pishmenny, and the conductor is Igor Ivashchenko.

In more than a month, the dance troupe performed twenty shows for the Chinese working people, with an audience of 114,510. In addition to performing in theaters and squares, they also performed for workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, the Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, and the Wuxi Shenxin Cotton Mill. They also performed for farmers at the Wenchong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Every performance was warmly welcomed by the audience. In particular, the dance programs "Embroidery Girl," "Gopak," "Cossack," "Spring Festival," "Ukrainian Suite," "Spring Suite," "Pheasant Dove," "Tropotyanka," "Kazan Tatar Dance," the humorous dance "Meeting," and the Russian humorous dance "Lover's Quarrel" were even more wonderful. Almost every performance was repeated at the audience's repeated request, with more than three curtain calls.

Thanks to the dance troupe's enthusiastic rehearsals, the accompanying training team—twenty male and female dancers from the Wuhan People's Art Theatre of China—alternately performed the "Tropotyanka" dance four times in Shanghai and Wuxi. It is expected that before going to Beijing, they will be able to add a joint performance program.

In Wuhan and Guangzhou, some of the dance troupe's artists held professional discussions with local literary and art workers on dance choreography, dance music composition, and instrument playing, and expressed their opinions on some Chinese classical operas and some song and dance programs, giving Chinese literary and art workers a lot of helpful assistance and inspiration.

At the suggestion of the dance troupe's Communist Youth League organization, youth league members from Shanghai's literary and art circles and the dance troupe's youth league members held a joint party.

The dance troupe has shown great concern and interest in everything in our country. So far, they have visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, the Shanghai Lu Xun Memorial Hall, advanced agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Guangzhou, the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, the Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, the Wuxi Clay Figurine Plaster Art and Crafts Production Cooperative, and various places of scenic and historical interest.

    苏联乌克兰国家舞蹈团
    在武汉上海等地受到热烈欢迎
    本报讯　应中华人民共和国文化部邀请来我国参加在武汉举行的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会闭幕式、并到各地访问演出的苏联乌克兰国家舞蹈团，从七月五日在武汉举行开幕演出到现在，已经在我国进行了一个多月的访问活动。在此期间，舞蹈团访问了武汉、广州、杭州、上海和无锡等五个城市，按照预定计划，还将到郑州和西安，最后到北京进行访问演出。
    乌克兰国家舞蹈团是一个成立刚刚五年的专业舞蹈团体，可是它的节目却是十分成熟和美妙的。舞蹈团的艺术指导是俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋艺术家、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国功勋演员，斯大林奖金获得者巴维尔·维尔斯基，团长彼什缅内，乐队指挥伊果尔·伊瓦什琴柯。
    一个多月来，舞蹈团为我国劳动人民演出了二十场，观众十一万四千五百一十人。他们除了在剧场和广场演出以外，还在上海机床厂、杭州都锦生丝织厂、无锡申新纱厂为工人演出，也曾到过广州市郊文冲乡农业生产合作社为农民进行了演出。每一场演出都受到了观众的热烈欢迎，特别是舞蹈节目中的“绣花姑娘”、“哥巴克”、“哥萨克”、“春节”、“乌克兰组舞”、“春天组舞”、“雉鸠”、“特罗波强卡”、“喀山鞑靼人舞”、滑稽舞蹈“会见”和俄罗斯诙谐舞蹈“失恋者”更为精彩，几乎每场都在观众再三要求下作了重演，谢幕三次以上。
    由于舞蹈团的热心排练，随团学习队——中国武汉市人民艺术剧院的二十个男女舞蹈演员在上海，无锡两地，曾轮流演了“特罗波强卡”舞四场，预计到北京前，还能增加一个合演节目。
    在武汉和广州，舞蹈团的部分艺术家曾分别与当地文艺工作者就舞蹈编导，舞蹈音乐创作，乐器演奏等问题举行了专业座谈，并对中国一部分古典歌剧及某些歌舞节目发表了观感，给了我国文艺工作者许多有益的帮助和启发。
    由于舞蹈团的共青团组织的建议，上海市文艺界的青年团员和舞蹈团的青年团员等曾举行过一次联欢晚会。
    舞蹈团对我国的一切都怀着很大的关注和兴趣。到目前为止，他们参观了武汉长江大桥工地、上海机床厂、上海鲁迅纪念馆、广州市郊的高级农业生产合作社，农民运动讲习所旧址、杭州都锦生丝织厂、无锡的泥人石膏工艺美术品生产合作社以及各地的名胜古迹。
