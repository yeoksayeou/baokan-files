Descartes - A Pioneer of Rational Thinking
Chen Xiuzhai

In the history of human thought, there have been some epoch-making figures. Descartes (1596-1650) is one of them.

After about a thousand years of feudalism in Europe, religious obscurantism tightly bound people's minds. People believed that there could be no knowledge other than divine revelation. The philosophy of this period, called "Scholasticism," was openly regarded as "the handmaiden of theology," and its sole function was to provide arguments for religious dogmas, using sets of tedious and purely formalistic logical deductions to prove the existence of God, the so-called "Trinity" of God, and that humans are born with sin. In addition, it was used to argue about questions such as "how many angels can stand on the head of a pin" and "whether the roses in heaven have thorns." Naturally, there were many people who raised objections, but they were persecuted by the dark forces of feudal religion. Some were exiled, imprisoned, and some were burned alive. Their works were all listed as forbidden books or completely destroyed. What dominated was still this extremely barbaric, cruel, and extremely empty and boring religious obscurantism.

With the development of production, the emerging bourgeoisie, representing the progressive forces of society at that time, was formed. People demanded the development of production and the understanding of the objective world, and could no longer tolerate the shackles and deception of this theology that advocated superstition and the tedious and empty Scholasticism. So some people stood up and said: I express doubt about all this; I only believe that what is clear and understandable after my rational examination is the truth; the set taught by religious theology and Scholasticism cannot stand the test of reason and is therefore false and untrustworthy. This person was Descartes. His epoch-making significance lies here - he was a pioneer in advocating reason against blind faith, and also one of the founders of modern mechanical materialism.

Descartes was a great 17th-century French scientist and philosopher. This year marks the 360th anniversary of his birth. He was born into a noble family in La Haye and received traditional Scholastic education in his early years, but he had long expressed dissatisfaction with traditional education. Because he felt that the constraints of the feudal forces in France at that time were too serious, he sold his hereditary estate and lived in the Netherlands, which was more developed in capitalism and had a relatively free environment, for a long time, engaging in writing. In the Netherlands, he wrote his famous works "Discourse on Method," "Meditations on First Philosophy," and "Principles of Philosophy." Because of the anti-feudal and anti-religious essence of these works, they were not tolerated by the clergy in the Netherlands, and he was forced to accept an invitation from the Queen of Sweden to go to Stockholm, where he died shortly after. After his death, his works were included in the Roman Pope's "Index Librorum Prohibitorum". But at this time, capitalism was about to overthrow the feudal system and establish its own ruling position. Descartes' progressive ideas, representing the requirements of the new era, could no longer be blocked by the outdated and reactionary feudal forces. Descartes' advocacy of respecting human reason and opposing blind worship of authority and anti-rational fideism was supported by many people during his lifetime, and left a profound impact after his death; it not only influenced many people at that time, but also directly influenced the materialist thinkers on the eve of the French Revolution in the 18th century. "Reason" was a clear banner for the bourgeoisie against feudal forces throughout the bourgeois revolution. In philosophy, Descartes' "Rationalism" or "Rationalism" was an opposing school to Bacon, Locke, and others' "Empiricism," but on the other hand, it can also be said that it, together with "Empiricism," was equally a powerful iron fist against outdated Scholasticism and reactionary fideism.

Descartes was a mathematician. He was the founder of analytic geometry in mathematics. This in itself is a remarkable contribution in the history of science. Because this is not just the creation of a branch of mathematics, but, as Engels pointed out, it allowed motion and dialectics to enter mathematics, and on this basis, calculus was produced. Without these mathematical achievements, the entire development of modern natural science would be unimaginable.

Precisely because Descartes was a mathematician, he deeply felt that mathematical knowledge was the most certain and reliable, especially the knowledge of geometry, which almost fascinated him. For example, starting from simple "self-evident" axioms such as "equals added to equals are equal," many theorems and propositions can be deduced using a rational deductive method, all constituting a complete system, in which each part or each step is so clear and distinct that it leaves no room for doubt. Descartes believed that such knowledge was true and reliable knowledge, universal and necessary knowledge. Because propositions and principles in geometry are recognized by every person with sound reason, they are "infallible" and have no exceptions. In Descartes' view, this can be said to be the model of truth. He regarded the clarity and distinctness of ideas as the standard of truth. This is one of the main viewpoints of rationalism. Of course, believing that the standard of truth lies in the clarity and distinctness of the idea itself, rather than proving that the understanding corresponds to the object through practice, is an idealist viewpoint. But at that time, as opposed to taking the authority of the "Bible" as the standard of truth, it had progressive significance.

Since the knowledge of geometry is the most reliable knowledge, then, in Descartes' view, this method should not only be used to deal with problems of space or graphics, but also to deal with larger problems, that is, to deal with philosophical problems and worldview problems. So Descartes used the "geometric method" to study philosophy, and some of his works even imitated geometry in form.

Geometry starts from the simplest "self-evident" axioms, so Descartes also wanted to find a simplest "self-evident" principle in philosophy as a starting point. To find such a "self-evident" principle, it is necessary to remove everything that is unclear and uncertain, and Descartes believed that the method to remove this is doubt. This doubt is only a means, a method, to remove all uncertain things in order to find certain and undoubted things. It is not an end in itself. Therefore, Descartes is not a skeptic who stops at the stage of doubt. His doubt, as he himself said, is like completely demolishing an outdated and dilapidated old house in order to build a more solid, more beautiful, and more useful new house, or like removing floating sand and mud in order to find solid rock as a foundation.

So Descartes examined all things with a spirit of doubt. He found everything, even the existence of his own body, to be doubtful. But he then reasoned that everything is doubtful, but doubt itself is a clear fact, and is undoubted. Doubt is also a kind of thought. I am doubting, which means I am thinking; since I am thinking, therefore, the "I" as a thinker exists, isn't this also undoubted? In this way, Descartes believed that he had found a truly reliable principle, which is "I think, therefore I am."

"I think, therefore I am" is a very famous formula in the history of philosophy. This formula on the one hand shows Descartes' idealistic tendency of starting from the subjective "I" rather than from the existence of the objective world, and from abstract thinking rather than from scientific facts. But on the other hand, it also shows Descartes' rationalist spirit of anti-religious dogma and anti-blind faith. Descartes affirms the existence of "I" not because the "Bible" records that God created man, but because "I" am doing rational thinking. Descartes affirmed the infinite power and supreme dignity of man's own reason. In an era when religious obscurantism and blind faith dominated, this could not but give great encouragement to people who were beginning to awaken and played a great progressive role. It is wrong to simply negate Descartes' formula "I think, therefore I am" as a formula of subjective idealism without considering the specific historical conditions.

Of course, it cannot be denied that Descartes' thought itself is idealistic, nor can it be denied that Descartes' rationalist epistemology and methodology themselves are a kind of idealistic thought that is divorced from reality and belittles experience. Starting from the formula "I think, therefore I am," Descartes carried out purely abstract logical reasoning, and as a result, reached a dualistic worldview, believing that there are two kinds of entities in the world, mind and matter. The characteristic of the mind is thinking, and the characteristic of matter is extension. These two kinds of entities are independent of each other and cannot determine each other. But Descartes finally still rooted both mind and matter in God, believing that they were both created by God, and relied on God's guarantee to determine the existence of the objective material world. Here, we see that dualism must ultimately fall into idealism, and we also see the erroneous side of Descartes' thought that has not completely gotten rid of the influence of Scholasticism. But it must still be pointed out that in Descartes' time, dualism was a convenient path to initially break free from the shackles of Scholasticism.

Although Descartes relied on God's guarantee, he ultimately affirmed the objective existence of the material world. And when he further studied the actual nature of the objective world in his "Physics," Descartes abandoned that idealistic and dualistic thought and became a materialist. In this respect, Descartes is one of the founders of mechanical materialism, and this mechanical materialism, under the historical conditions at that time, was the highest achievement that human thought could reach, and was the most progressive thought at that time. In "Physics," Descartes regarded matter as the only entity. And it is in this area of research that Descartes has made many important contributions. He studied the relationship between matter and motion. Although he could not solve this problem very correctly, and did not think that motion was the motion of matter itself, but only understood motion as the movement of position in space, and therefore had mechanical and metaphysical shortcomings, he was the first to put forward the idea of the conservation of momentum, that is, the motion of an object can be transmitted to other objects, and the total amount of motion in the entire world is constant and indestructible. This is the precursor to the law of "conservation of energy," and has great significance in the history of science. Descartes also put forward meaningful ideas about the generation of the universe. He believed that the world was initially a kind of homogeneous material particles, and as a result of vortex motion, gradually formed the three elements of earth, air, and fire, and the heavy earth element left the center to form planets, and the light fire element remained in the center to form the sun and stars. Although Descartes still believed that this vortex motion was initially due to God's impetus, this idea believes that all things in the world are produced by the motion of matter itself, and is opposed to the religious worldview of God creating all things. It is basically a materialist idea, and believes that the formation of the world is a process of motion and change, which is another valuable dialectical idea.

In addition, Descartes also made many studies in biology, anatomy, and psychology. He had already ingeniously observed the phenomenon of the reflex arc in psychology, and even the phenomenon of conditional reflexes, so Pavlov gave him a high evaluation. Descartes' valuable scientific research results and his tireless spirit of exploration are forever worthy of people's admiration.

Bourgeois historians of philosophy always obliterate the materialist side of Descartes' philosophy, and exaggerate its idealistic side. This is a distortion of the history of philosophy. In today's advocacy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "marching towards science," it is meaningful to correctly study and evaluate the thought of this great scientist and philosopher of the emerging bourgeois period, to promote his spirit of opposing blind worship of authority, opposing blind faith, and striving to promote independent thinking, and to elaborate the correct materialism and brilliant dialectical elements contained in his thought, for enlivening our thinking and enriching our scientific culture.

    笛卡尔——提倡理性的思想先驱
    陈修斋
    在人类思想发展史上，有过一些划时代的人物。笛卡尔（1596—1650）也是其中之一。
  　欧洲经过了约一千年的封建时代，宗教的蒙昧主义紧紧地束缚了人的头脑。人们都相信：除了上帝的启示，是不能有任何知识的。这时期的哲学，叫做“经院哲学”，被公开地认为是“神学的奴婢”，它的唯一功用就是用来为宗教的教条作论证，用一套一套烦琐的、纯粹形式主义的逻辑推论，来证明上帝的存在，上帝是所谓“三位一体”，以及人是天生就有罪的等等。除此之外，就是来争论“一个针尖上究竟能站多少个天使”，“天堂上的玫瑰是否有刺”之类的问题。自然，其间也曾经有过许多人，提出过反对的意见，但是他们都受到封建的宗教的黑暗势力的迫害，有的被放逐、监禁，有的被活活烧死了，他们的著作都被列为禁书，或全部被销毁了，占统治地位的依旧是这种极端野蛮残酷又极端空洞无聊的宗教蒙昧主义。
    随着生产的发展，代表当时社会进步力量的新兴资产阶级形成了。人们要求发展生产，要求认识这个客观世界，已不能再忍受这种崇尚迷信的神学和烦琐空洞的经院哲学的束缚和愚弄。于是有人起来说：我对这一切都表示怀疑；我只相信经过我的理性的考察，而发现它清楚明白的东西，才是真理；宗教神学和经院哲学所教人的那一套，经不起理性的考察，就都是虚伪不可信的。这个人，就是笛卡尔。他的划时代的意义，也就在这里——他是一位提倡理性以反对盲目信仰的先锋，同时也是近代机械唯物主义的首创者之一。
    笛卡尔是十七世纪法国一位伟大的科学家和哲学家，今年是他诞生的第三百六十周年。他出生于拉·爱伊地方的贵族家庭，早年也受过传统的经院哲学的教育，但他早就对传统教育表示不满。他因为觉得当时法国封建势力的束缚过于严重，就卖掉了自己的世袭领地，长期卜居于资本主义较发达、环境比较自由的荷兰，从事著述。在荷兰，写下了他的“方法论”、“沉思录”、“哲学原理”等名著。因为这些著作的反封建、反宗教思想的实质，也为荷兰的僧侣阶级所不容，他被迫应瑞典女王的邀请去斯德哥尔摩，不久就在瑞典逝世。在他死后，他的著作被列入罗马教皇的“禁书目录”。但这时已到了资本主义要推翻封建制度，确立自己的统治地位的时代，代表新的时代要求的笛卡尔的进步思想，已经不是过时的反动封建势力所能阻遏得住的了。笛卡尔所创导的崇尚人的理性而反对盲目崇拜权威、反对反理性的信仰主义的思想，在他生前已得许多人的拥护，在他死后更留下了深远的影响；不仅影响了他当时的许多人，并且直接影响了十八世纪法国大革命前夕的唯物论思想家。“理性”，是整个资产阶级革命时期资产阶级反对封建势力的一面鲜明的旗帜。在哲学上，笛卡尔所创导的“理性主义”或“唯理论”，一方面和倍根、洛克等的“经验主义”是一个对立的派别，但另一方面也可说和“经验主义”一起，同样是反对过时的经院哲学和反动的信仰主义的两个有力的铁拳。
    笛卡尔是一位数学家，他是数学中的解析几何学的奠基人。这本身就是科学史上一个了不起的贡献。因为这不只是创立了数学中的一个部门而已，而是像恩格斯所指出的，使运动和辩证法从此进入了数学，并且在此基础上才产生出微积分。要是没有这些数学上的成就，整个近代自然科学上的发展，都是不可想像的。
    正因为笛卡尔是一位数学家，所以他深感到数学的知识是最确定可靠的，尤其像几何学的知识，更几乎使他着迷。譬如，从“等量加等量其和必等”之类简单的“自明”的公理出发，用一种理性的演绎的方法，就可以推论出许多的定理，命题，全部构成一个完整的系统，其中每一部分或每一步骤都是那样清楚，明晰，使人无可怀疑。笛卡尔认为，像这样的知识，才是真实可靠的知识，是普遍必然的知识。因为像几何学上的命题和原理，是每一个有健全理性的人承认的，是“万无一失”，绝无例外的。在笛卡尔看来，这可说是真理的典范。他把观念的清楚、明晰，作为是真理的标准。这是理性主义的主要观点之一。当然，认为真理的标准就在于观念本身的清楚、明晰，而不是通过实践证明认识和对象相符，这是唯心主义的观点。但是在当时，作为反对以“圣经”的权威作为真理的标准，它是有进步意义的。
    既然像几何学的知识是最可靠的知识，那末，在笛卡尔看来，就不应该光用这种方法去处理空间或图形的问题，而应该用这种方法来处理更大的问题，即处理哲学的问题，世界观的问题。于是笛卡尔就用“几何学的方法”来研究哲学，他的有些作品，甚至连形式上都是摹仿几何学的。
    几何学是从最简单的“自明”公理出发的，于是笛卡尔在哲学上也要找出一条最简单的“自明”的原则，来作为出发点。要找出这样一条“自明”的原则，就要把一切不清楚的、不确定的东西都去掉，而这去掉的方法，笛卡尔认为就是怀疑。这怀疑，只是去掉一切不确定的东西以找出确定无疑的东西的一种手段，一种方法，它本身不是目的，因此，笛卡尔并不是停止在怀疑阶段上的怀疑论者。他的怀疑，照他自己所说，就好比是把过时的破烂的旧房子整个拆除，为的是造起更坚固、更美观、更有用的新房子来，或者是把浮沙和污泥排除，以便找出坚固的岩石来作为基础。
    于是笛卡尔就以怀疑的精神来对一切事物进行考查。他对一切事物，甚至连自己身体的存在，都发觉是可怀疑的。但他转而推论道：一切都是可怀疑的，但怀疑本身则是明明白白的事实，是无可怀疑的。怀疑也是一种思想，我在怀疑，也就是我在思想；既然我在思想，因此，作为一种思想者的“我”是存在的，这岂不也是无可怀疑的吗？这样，笛卡尔就认为找到了一条确实可靠的原则，这就是“我思故我在”。
    “我思故我在”是哲学史上一个很有名的公式。这公式一方面表示笛卡尔不是从客观世界的存在而是从主观的“我”出发，不是从科学事实而是从抽象思维出发的唯心主义思想倾向，但另一方面也正显示出笛卡尔反宗教教条，反盲目信仰的理性主义的精神。笛卡尔之肯定“我”的存在，不是因为“圣经”上记载着上帝曾创造了人，而是因为“我”在作理性的思维。笛卡尔肯定了人自己的理性的无比威力和无上尊严。这在一个宗教蒙昧主义和盲目信仰占统治地位的时代里，不能不给初步觉醒了的人以极大的鼓舞，起了很大的进步作用。不顾具体的历史条件，对笛卡尔的“我思故我在”的公式认为就是主观唯心主义的公式而加以简单否定，是不对的。
    当然，不能否认笛卡尔的这一思想，本身是唯心主义的，也不能否认笛卡尔的理性主义的认识论和方法论，本身是一种脱离实际，贬抑经验的唯心主义思想。从“我思故我在”这一公式出发，笛卡尔进行了纯粹抽象的逻辑推论，结果达到了一个二元论的世界观，既认为世界上存在着心灵和物质两种实体，心灵的特性是思维，而物质的特性是广袤，这两种实体是彼此独立，不能互相决定的。可是笛卡尔最后仍旧把心和物两者都归根于上帝，认为都是上帝的创造，并且依靠上帝的保证，来确定客观物质世界的存在。这里，我们看到二元论最后必然仍旧要陷于唯心主义，也看到笛卡尔思想中仍未能完全摆脱经院哲学的影响的错误的一面。但仍须指出，在笛卡尔的时代，二元论是初步摆脱经院哲学束缚的方便道路。
    虽然是借助于上帝的保证，笛卡尔毕竟肯定了物质世界的客观存在。而当他在他的“物理学”中进一步来研究客观世界的实际性质时，笛卡尔就抛弃了那种唯心主义的和二元论的思想，而成为一个唯物主义者了。就这方面来看，笛卡尔是机械唯物主义的创始人之一，而这种机械唯物主义，在当时的历史条件下，是人类思想所能达到的最高成就，在当时是最进步的思想。在“物理学”中，笛卡尔把物质看作就是唯一的实体。而正是在这方面的研究中，笛卡尔有很多重要的贡献。他研究了物质和运动的关系问题。虽然他还不能很正确地解决这个问题，并不认为运动是物质自己的运动，而把运动只了解为空间中的位置移动，因而有机械论的、形而上学的缺点，但他却首先提出了动量守恒的思想，即认为—物体的运动可以传给别的物体，而整个世界的运动总量是不变不灭的。这是“能量守恒”定律的先声，在科学史上有重大意义。笛卡尔也提出了关于宇宙生成的很有意义的思想。他认为世界最初是一种同质的物质微粒，由于涡旋运动的结果，就逐渐形成土、气、火三种元素，而重的土元素就离开中心形成行星，轻的火元素则留在中心形成太阳和恒星。虽然笛卡尔还认为这种涡旋运动最初是由于上帝的推动，但这种思想认为世界万物是由物质运动本身所产生，和上帝创造万物的宗教世界观是对立的，它基本上是一种唯物主义的思想，并且认为世界的形成是一种运动变化的过程，这又是很有价值的辩证法思想。
    此外，笛卡尔对于生物学、解剖学，以及心理学等也都作了许多研究。他已经天才地观察到了心理学上的反射弧，以至条件反射的现象，因此巴甫洛夫对他作了很高的评价。笛卡尔这些有价值的科学研究的成果，和他孜孜不倦的探索精神，永远值得人的钦敬。
    资产阶级哲学史家总是抹煞笛卡尔哲学中唯物主义的一面，而夸大它唯心主义的一面，这是对于哲学史的歪曲。在提倡“百家争鸣”、“向科学进军”的今天，正确地研究并估计资产阶级新兴时期的这位大科学家和大哲学家的思想，发扬他那种反对盲目崇拜权威、反对盲目信仰、竭力主张发挥独立思想的精神，阐发他的思想中所包含的正确的唯物主义和光辉的辩证法因素，对于活跃我们的思想，丰富我们的科学文化，都是有意义的。
