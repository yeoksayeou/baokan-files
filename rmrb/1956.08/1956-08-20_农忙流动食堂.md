    Mobile Canteens for the Busy Farming Season
    Zhang Ziqing
    The Haotang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Xindian Township, Xinyang County, Henan Province, is located at the northeastern foot of Mount Zhenlei. Due to the crisscrossing gullies and rugged roads, the members are scattered, which is very inconvenient for production. Some members have to walk four or five miles to their work locations, and some have to cross mountains, which wastes a lot of production time. In spring, the members never went to work early in the morning. Even in the morning and afternoon, they worked a couple of hours less than the members in the plains, and they often missed meal times.
    In order to solve the difficulties of the members, the leading cadres of this cooperative, in the Second Production Brigade where the members were too scattered, piloted two farm-busy canteens with the production team as the unit. These two canteens had four members as cooks, and the sixty-seven male and female members who joined the canteens collectively collected firewood, shared grain, vegetables, and money according to the number of people, and shared the work points of the cooks. Adopting a mobile form, the canteen cooked meals near the homes of members where they were working.
    The mobile canteens for the busy farming season have many advantages. For the members, it avoids the fatigue of traveling back and forth, and they can do two or three more hours of work every day. At the same time, it also reduces the diseases caused by eating cold food and drinking cold water in the past, and saves money. In the first ten days of running the canteen, each person spent an average of only eight cents per meal. Because they did not need to cook at home, thirty-eight women who used to cook at home also participated in production. With this kind of canteen, the members attended work neatly, and it was also easier to evaluate work and record points than before.

    农忙流动食堂
    张子青
    河南信阳县辛店乡郝堂高级农业社，位于震雷山东北脚下。由于山沟纵横、道路崎岖，社员们居住不集中，生产很不方便。有的社员到耕作地点，就得走四、五里路，有的还要翻山越岭，耽误的生产时间很多。春季社员们早晨就没有出过工，就是在上、下午，也比平坦地区的社员少劳动个把钟头，还常常误了吃饭时间。
    这个社的领导干部，为了解决社员们的困难，在社员居住过于分散的第二生产大队，以生产小队为单位，试办了两个农忙食堂。这两个食堂有四个社员担任炊事员，由入伙的六十七个男女社员集体打柴，按人摊粮、摊菜、摊钱，并分担炊事员的工分。采取流动形式，社员在哪里干活，食堂就在社员干活地点的附近人家作饭。
    农忙流动食堂好处很多。对社员来说，避免了往返的劳累，每天能多做两、三个钟头的活；同时，也减少了社员过去因吃冷饭、喝冷水而造成的疾病，还少花了钱。办食堂的头十天内，每人每顿饭平均只八分钱。因为不需要在家做饭了，有三十八个过去在家做饭的妇女，也参加了生产。有这种食堂，社员出工齐，也比以前好评工记分了。
