Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 30th. The 14th session of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic opened in Berlin on August 29th. Walter Ulbricht, First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, delivered an important speech on the peaceful reunification of Germany and pointed out five conditions for German reunification.

    Ulbricht said that the Bonn government, according to the plans of the powerful Konzern bosses, bank bosses, and large landowners in West Germany, has not only built a dam that splits Germany in two, but is also constantly raising it. German unification can only be achieved after the dam built by West German militarists is removed.

    Ulbricht said: The national interests of our people and our country require:

    1.  Limit the armed forces of both parts of Germany. Recruitment of armed forces should only be carried out on a voluntary basis. After German reunification, Germany should be included in an area with limited armaments. The number of German troops can be assumed not to exceed 200,000.

    2.  Remove Hitler's generals and other revanchists from state organs and the army. Military monopoly capital embodying revanchist policies and fascism should be nationalized.

    3.  Foreign troops should gradually withdraw from German territory.

    4.  Grant freedom to all democratic organizations, lift the ban on the German Communist Party, and dissolve all militarist organizations and alliances.

    5.  The government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany should cooperate to facilitate the rapprochement between the two Germanies. Representatives of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Parliament of Bonn, as well as representatives of the two governments, should negotiate on the issue of reunifying Germany.

    Ulbricht pointed out that, given that the Adenauer government does not intend and is unable to embark on a path of restoring German unification that is in line with the national and social interests of the German people, it is clear that only when the residents of West Germany draw conclusions from the bankruptcy of Adenauer's policies, force the Adenauer government to resign, and establish a government willing to work with the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic to resolve national issues through peaceful means, will the real conditions for restoring German unification be met.

    Lothar Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a statement on behalf of the government at the meeting entitled "On the Danger of German Militarism and the Necessity of Peaceful Resolution of All Issues."

    Bolz outlined the current international situation developing under the slogan of easing international tensions and resolving outstanding issues peacefully through consultation. When discussing the German situation, Bolz emphasized that while the German Democratic Republic is moving along the path of disarmament and further development of democracy, the West German government is pursuing a policy of armament, opposing the prohibition of atomic weapons, opposing the reduction of US, British, and French troops stationed in West Germany. The West German government is adopting fascist methods, banning the German Communist Party, and is taking measures against other workers' organizations. The government of the German Democratic Republic calls on all German people to work together to thwart the revival of German militarism, thereby ensuring peace in Germany.

    Bolz mentioned the suggestions made by the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany aimed at creating good preconditions for rapprochement between the two German states. He said that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has not responded to any of these initiatives; however, the government of the German Democratic Republic has not withdrawn these suggestions.

    Bolz stated on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic: As long as there are still two Germanies on German territory, no issue concerning Germany can be resolved without the participation of the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic will not recognize any solution to these problems as binding on it if it is resolved without the participation of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    After discussion, the People's Chamber unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the statement issued by Bolz on behalf of the government and Ulbricht's statement.

    必须铲除阿登纳集团制造的分裂德国的堤坝
    乌布利希提出德国统一的五项条件
    新华社柏林30日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院第十四次会议8月29日在柏林开幕。民主德国第一副总理乌布利希就德国的和平统一问题作了重要发言，并且指出了关于德国统一的五项条件。
    乌布利希说，波恩政府按照西德那些掌执大权的康采恩老板、银行老板和大地主的计划，不仅筑成了一条把德国分劈成两半的堤坝，而且还不断加高它。德国的统一唯有在铲除西德军国主义者建造的这条堤坝之后才能实现。
    乌布利希说：我国人民和我们国家的民族利益要求：
    一、限制德国两部分的武装力量。招募武装部队只能在志愿的基础上进行。在德国统一后，德国应当列入军备有限制的地区。德国的军队人数可以假定不超过二十万人。
    二、从国家机关和军队中清除希特勒的将军和其他复仇主义者。体现复仇主义政策和法西斯主义的军事垄断资本应当收归国有。
    三、外国军队逐步从德国领土撤退。
    四、给予一切民主组织以自由，取消对德国共产党的禁令，解散一切军国主义组织和联盟。
    五、德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府应该合作，以利于两个德国的接近。德意志民主共和国人民议院和波恩联邦议院的代表以及两国政府的代表应该就重新统一德国的问题进行谈判。
    乌布利希指出，鉴于阿登纳政府不打算而且也无法走上符合德国人民的民族利益和社会利益的恢复德国统一的道路，显然只有等到西德居民从阿登纳政策的破产作出结论，强迫阿登纳政府辞职，建立起愿意同人民议院和德意志民主共和国政府一起通过和平途径解决民族问题的政府，那时，恢复德国统一的现实条件才算具备。
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨在会上代表政府发表了“关于德国军国主义的危险性和和平解决一切问题的必要性”的声明。
    博尔茨概述了在缓和国际紧张局势和通过协商和平解决悬而未决的问题的口号下发展的当前国际局势。在谈到德国形势的时候，博尔茨强调指出，当德意志民主共和国沿着裁减军备和进一步发展民主的道路前进的时候，西德政府却在执行武装政策，反对禁止原子武器、反对减少美、英、法三国在西德的驻军，西德政府采用法西斯方法，禁止了德国共产党，并且正在采取措施来反对其他工人组织。德意志民主共和国政府号召全体德国人民共同努力阻挠德国军国主义的复活，从而保证德国的和平。
    博尔茨提到了德意志民主共和国向德意志联邦共和国提出的目的在于为两个德意志国家之间的接近创造良好前提的一些建议。他说，德意志联邦共和国政府对所有这些倡议都没有答复，然而德意志民主共和国政府仍然没有撤回这些建议。
    博尔茨代表德意志民主共和国政府声明：只要德国领土上仍然存在着两个德国，有关德国的任何一个问题没有德意志民主共和国参加是不能解决的。如果没有德意志民主共和国政府参加而擅自解决这些问题，德意志民主共和国政府是不承认这种解决对它有约束力的。
    经过讨论，人民议院一致通过了决议，支持博尔茨代表政府发表的声明和乌布利希的声明。
