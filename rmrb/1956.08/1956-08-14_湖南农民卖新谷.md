Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 11th - Hunan Province peasants, after a bumper harvest of early rice, are promptly selling new grain to the state. In the double-cropping rice main producing areas of the Dongting Lake plain and both banks of the Xiangjiang River, agricultural cooperatives have sold more than 100 million jin of new grain to the state in the past half-month.

　　Grain purchasing departments in counties around Dongting Lake and along the Xiangjiang River have established more than 1,500 purchasing stations in rural areas to facilitate grain sales for the peasants. Along the roads used by peasants to sell grain, there are also sufficient tea stations and medical stations. Nanxian and Liling counties alone have established more than 200 tea stations and more than 80 medical stations to serve the grain-selling peasants.

　　This year, grain purchasing stations in various localities have universally signed grain purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives. These contracts specifically stipulate the time, location, variety, quality, and quantity of grain sales. Therefore, the order of grain sales by peasants is better than in previous years.

    湖南农民卖新谷
    新华社长沙11日电　早稻丰收后的湖南省农民，及时向国家出售新谷。双季稻主要产区洞庭湖滨平原和湘江两岸各农业社，半个月来已经向国家出售了一亿多斤新谷。
    洞庭湖滨和湘江两岸各县粮食收购部门在农村中设立一千五百多个收购站，便利农民售粮。农民售粮的路上，还设有足够的茶水站和医疗站。仅南县、醴陵两县就设立了二百多个茶水站和八十多个医疗站，为售粮农民服务。
    今年各地粮食收购站普遍和农业社签订了粮食收购合同。这些合同都具体规定售粮时间、地点、品种、质量和数量。因此，农民售粮秩序比往年好。
