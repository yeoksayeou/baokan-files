    Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Abuse "Vouchers"
    Recently, the People's Bank of China in Henan Province discovered that 192 agricultural cooperatives in 125 townships in 18 counties including Zhenping, Tongxu, Nanle, Huojia, Xinxiang, Xuchang, Zhongmu, and suburban areas of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Anyang three cities, had unauthorizedly printed and issued circulating coupons to replace currency. These circulating coupons had face values ranging from one cent to ten yuan, with more than ten kinds of names such as "vegetable coupons," "supply coupons," "green vegetable circulating coupons," "fruit coupons," "circulating funds," "ancient coins," "work point coupons," "money coupons," etc. The confirmed amount issued reached more than 120,000 yuan. Agricultural cooperatives used these coupons to purchase manure, seeds, firewood, and grass from members, as well as for members' advance loans and wage payments. Members could use the coupons to buy back vegetables, grain, coal, alkali, salt, and other materials from within the cooperative. In some areas, farmers could use the coupons to buy salt, oil, and general merchandise from supply and marketing cooperatives. The "circulating funds" issued by some agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Zhengzhou were freely circulating in the market.
    The popularity of these "circulating coupons" has affected the reputation of the Renminbi and aroused suspicion and dissatisfaction among the masses.
    Abusing the issuance of circulating coupons is a violation of national law. In addition to vigorously publicizing financial policies, Party and government leading organs and banks at all levels should order the issuing units to recall the issued "circulating coupons" within a time limit. Agricultural cooperatives should use accounting methods or pay cash when purchasing materials from members; labor remuneration pre-distributed to members should be paid in cash or partly in kind; when distributing food and supplies to members, and it is necessary to issue substitute food certificates, they can only be issued in units of jin and liang, not in monetary units. When agricultural cooperatives lack sufficient working capital and small bills, they can be adjusted through credit cooperatives or banks, but they must never illegally issue circulating coupons.

### 农业社不应该滥发“代金券”

    农业社不应该滥发“代金券”
    最近，河南省人民银行发现镇平、通许、南乐、获嘉、新乡、许昌、中牟等十八个县和郑州、洛阳、安阳三个市的郊区，有一百二十五个乡的一百九十二个农业社擅自印发流通券来代替货币。这些流通券的票面额有一分到十元共十多种，名称有“菜票”、“供应票”、“青菜流通票”、“果票”、“流动金”、“古币”、“工分票”、“钱票”等，已查明的发行数额达十二万多元。农业社通过这种票券收购社员的粪肥、种籽、柴草及用于社员预借、工资支出等，社员持券可买回社内的菜、粮、煤、碱、盐等物资。有些地区的农民可以持票券到供销社买盐、油和百货。郑州市郊区某些农业社印发的“流动金”在市场上畅通无阻。
    这些“流通券”的流行，影响了人民币的信誉，并且引起了群众的怀疑和不满。
    滥发流通券是违反国家法律的行为。各级党政领导机关和银行除应当大力宣传金融政策外，对于已发的“流通券”应该命令发行的单位限期收回；农业社收购社员的物资应该用记账办法或付给现款；预分给社员劳动报酬，应该付给现金或部分实物；分配给社员食物用品，需要发代替食物证券的时候，也只能以斤、两为单位，不能以货币为单位。农业社准备的流动资金和零票不足的时候，可以通过信用社或银行调剂，但是绝不能违法发行流通券。　李文华
