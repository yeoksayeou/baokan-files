    Wei River Bridgehead
    -- From Baoji to Chengdu, Part 1
    By Ji Xichen, Staff Reporter
    The wheat fields of the eight hundred-li Qin Chuan are like an endless golden ocean, rolling in waves, greeting the train heading east. Before our eyes, villages piled high with wheat stacks flash by for a moment, and then a patch of oily green autumn fields appears. The peaks of the Qinling Mountains, draped in cloud robes, are like a high wall, cutting off the blue sky to the south; the turbid Wei River is sometimes hidden behind the green forests, and sometimes stretches out like a silver snake before us. Looking at the vast and fertile fields outside the window, and the beautiful and magnificent scenery, many passengers are moved to hum songs.
     A Glimpse of Baoji
    When the train arrived in Baoji, although it was raining, the streets were still bustling with crowds and vehicles. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Longhai Railway, which connect here, are like two outstretched arms. Trains and cars from Shanghai, Hankou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and Hanzhong, as well as various construction vehicles going to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line, shuttle back and forth continuously. Some passengers and goods that originally took the Yangtze River to enter Sichuan also detour through Baoji to take the train to Chengdu. This makes Baoji even more bustling. Almost all the hotels, restaurants, station buildings, and platforms are crowded with seas of passengers, and piled with goods and equipment waiting to be transported.
    The streets of Baoji give people a feeling of prosperity everywhere. The factories spewing thick smoke, the bustling streets, and the emerging urban areas have changed beyond recognition. I remember eighteen years ago, when I passed through here, Baoji was only a city of twenty or thirty thousand people. How many tears of displaced wounded soldiers and refugees were on the dirty, narrow streets! But now, it has become an industrial city with a population of 210,000. With the influx of builders from all over the country, the city's population has increased by 70,000 in the last year and three months alone. In the past few years, the city's industrial output value has also increased more than elevenfold. The desolate Shilipu of the past has now become an industrial zone, the narrow and muddy street has become a wide and straight avenue, and the small street stalls have become large department stores with a wide variety of goods. Rows of new buildings and large factories under construction stand on both banks of the Wei River. The towering scaffolding and tall chimneys extend all the way to the foot of the Qinling Mountains. The production volume of the newly built railway machinery repair and assembly plant alone is equal to half of the total national railway engineering machinery repair and assembly volume!
    Since ancient times, Baoji has been an important transportation hub between Qin and Shu. Many heroes and outstanding figures have left behind relics here that are worth remembering. Jiangcheng Fort, on the outskirts of Baoji, is said to be the ancient hometown of Emperor Yan, Shennong. Diaoyutai in Diaoyu Township, Baoji County, is the place where the ancient military strategist "Jiang Ziya" fled from Shandong to live in seclusion and fish. Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty used the strategy of "repairing the plank road openly, and crossing Chencang secretly" to defeat Xiang Yu's general here. It is said that Baoji got its name because King Wen of Qin went hunting in Chencang Mountain and obtained a Baogei (a chicken that crows for tens of miles), so he changed Chencang to Baoji. There are still relics of Jiming Temple and Doujitai in the county.
    "These legends reflect the people's desire for happiness," said a comrade from the Municipal People's Committee. "However, in the past, people never heard any calls from the 'treasure chicken'! Today, the people have a real 'treasure chicken' - the whistles of the factories, the whistles of the trains, aren't they the best 'treasure chicken'! It reports good news of happiness to the people day and night!"
    The Starting Point of the Road to Happiness
    Leaving the urban area, I came to the Wei River bank. On both sides of the Wei River, Qingjiang River and Jinling River, which converge here, there are countless crowds of people and vehicles coming and going. In the harvested wheat fields, red flags are flying for the wheat harvesting competition. The mighty Wei River carries the turbid yellow flow, winding eastward. On this river that once nurtured our ancestors and irrigated ancient Chinese culture, stands the magnificent Wei River Bridge. The dark gray steel beams shine brightly in the sun, like a bright rainbow spanning the waters of the Wei River.
    This is the starting point of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Trains are whistling and crossing the bridge, heading towards the foothills of the Qinling Mountains. The person in charge of the railway construction headquarters opened a blue plan of the line, pointing to the winding line and said to me:
    "You see, the railway crosses the Wei River from here, goes south along the narrow valley of the Qingjiang River, and spirals upward. Then, it crosses the Qinling Mountains, Daba Mountains and the ancient plank road, crosses the Jialing River sixteen times, crosses the Baishui River, Fujiang River and more than twenty other rivers, passes through Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, along Fengxian, Huangshahe, Lueyang, Yangpingguan, Guangyuan, Yanmenba and other places to reach Chengdu. The entire line is 668 kilometers long, and except for the 150 kilometers in the southern section which are plains, the rest are all high mountains, steep ridges and deep valleys. Therefore, on average, there is a tunnel every less than three kilometers, and a bridge every one and a half kilometers. The project is extremely difficult. If the excavated and filled stones and soil were piled into dikes one meter high and one meter wide, it would circle the Earth's equator 1.8 times. On average, for every kilometer of road built, the stones and soil filled and excavated can fill more than 5,000 train carriages. Such a huge project is not only unprecedented in China, but also rare in the world's road construction history."
    Then, he introduced the construction process in detail. As early as more than forty years ago, in 1915, someone had roughly surveyed the Tongcheng Railway (from Datong, Shanxi to Chengdu, Sichuan). In 1936, someone used airplanes to measure the two railway lines from Baoji to Chengdu, and from Tianshui, Gansu to Chengdu. After that, it was surveyed twice more. Each time, the project was stopped midway due to the towering Qinling Mountains and the difficult Jianmen Pass. However, in the hands of the people, it only took four years and thirteen days to complete the railway.
    "This is a difficult road, but it is also a road to happiness," he continued. "By building this road, the rich products of Southwest China can be transported out in large quantities, especially the large amount of grain from Sichuan, known as the 'Land of Abundance', can be transported out at low prices to supply the needs of industrial cities and grain-deficient areas across the country. Many industrial construction materials and daily necessities from East China, Northeast China, and North China can also be transported into the Southwest in large quantities to support inland construction. After the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is fully opened to traffic, it can not only reduce the burden of shipping on the Sichuan River, but also save a lot of freight. The freight per ton of goods can be reduced by more than ten yuan compared to transportation by car. In the past, it took four days to travel from Baoji to Chengdu by car, but now it only takes one day and night."
    Along the Ancient Roads
    The train left the Wei River Bridge not far and entered the Qinling Mountain Valley. In the past, it was a place where wild animals roamed, apes cried and wolves howled, but now, the long whistles of steam engines and the rumbling of trains are ringing.
    Along the railway, you can see many thatched huts and work sheds of all sizes. Not long ago, these places were full of road construction workers. Now, most of the workers have been transferred to new construction sites, leaving only a few people to pile up retaining walls on both sides of the roadbed, and plant willows and *malan* grass to make the railway stronger and more beautiful.
    The train traveled more than twenty kilometers and entered "Dashanguan," a place that soldiers have always fought for. "Iron horses and autumn winds at Dashanguan." Here, the two mountains are steep and dangerous, and the ancient monument with the three characters "Dashanguan" written on it stands majestically in front of the mountain. The ancient stone slab road is submerged in the chest-high weeds. The Song Dynasty poet Lu You once used the phrase "Between Dashan and Chencang, the mountains and rivers are like a sturdy plate" to describe the momentum of the pass. During the Tianbao period of the Tang Dynasty, when An Lushan rebelled, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang traveled through this place to enter Sichuan.
    The famous ancient plank road "Chencang Road" starts from Dashanguan. Tang Dynasty Luo Ye's poem on Dashanguan Ridge, "Passing through a long journey, the sun is scarce, snowflakes slap the traveler's clothes like palms. Looking back from the top of the ridge to where people come from, I especially suspect that I am a bird flying." At that time, in order to connect the roads of Sichuan and Shaanxi, our ancestors carved holes in the ten-thousand-foot cliffs, installed wooden stakes, erected wooden boards, and built the "Zi-Wu Road," "Chencang Road," "Yinping Road," "Jianmen Road" and other thrilling ancient plank roads. Even so, they still did not conquer the natural dangers of Qin and Shu. People once described the rivers and mountains on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road like this:
    Broken walls connect high with the sky, monkeys lock their brows;
    Looking down at the valley, white clouds hang under your feet;
    Dangerous mountains and treacherous waters abound, the road to Shu is as difficult as ascending to the sky.
    For thousands of years, through how many dynasties, the rivers and mountains have not changed, and the road to Shu is still difficult as ascending to the blue sky, but today, in this place where "yellow cranes cannot fly over, and apes and monkeys want to cross but worry about climbing," a railway connects Sichuan and Shaanxi, and trains run like riding the clouds and fog, rushing over the steep mountain peaks. The workers used their own hands to realize the ideals and wishes of the Chinese people for thousands of years in just a few years!

    渭河桥头
    ——从宝鸡到成都之一
    本报记者　纪希晨
    八百里秦川的麦田，像无边的金色的海洋，滚着波浪，迎着东驶的火车。眼前，一会儿闪出堆着麦垛的村庄，一会又闪出一片油绿的秋田。披着云衣的秦岭峰峦，像一堵高墙，横断着南边的蓝天；浑浊的渭河，时而隐蔽在绿林的后面，时而又银蛇似的铺伸在眼前。望着窗外辽阔肥沃的原野，和那美妙浩瀚的景色，多少旅客都被惹动得哼起歌子来。
     宝鸡一瞥
    车到宝鸡的时候，天虽然下着雨，可是，街上人群车马依然熙熙攘攘。在这里接轨的宝成铁路和陇海铁路，好似两只伸出的手臂。来自上海、汉口、西安、兰州、成都、汉中的火车和汽车，以及通往宝成铁路沿线的各种工程车辆，往来穿梭不停。有的原来取道长江入川的旅客货物，也绕道宝鸡搭乘到成都的火车。这样，就使宝鸡变得更加繁闹起来。几乎所有的旅馆、饭店、站房、站台，都拥挤着人山人海的旅客，堆积着待运的货物和器材。
    宝鸡的街道，处处都给人以欣欣向荣的感觉。那吐着浓烟的工厂，繁闹的大街，新兴的市区，变得使人全然不认识了。记得十八年前，当我路过这里的时候，宝鸡只不过才两三万人，肮脏、狭小的街道上，有多少流落的伤兵和难民们的眼泪呵！可是现在，它变成拥有二十一万人口的工业城市了。随着各地建设者的拥来，单最近一年零三个月中，全市人口就增加了七万。几年来，全市工业产值也增加了十一倍多。昔日荒凉的十里铺，如今变成了工业区，狭窄的滥泥街，变成了宽阔笔直的大马路，沿街的小地摊，变成了百货琳琅的大商店。一排排的新建筑，和动工兴建的大工厂，在渭河两岸耸立起来。林立的脚手架，高大的烟囱，一直延伸到秦岭山下。单是新近建成的铁路机械修配工厂的生产量，就等于全国铁路工程机械修配总量的一半！
    宝鸡，自古就是秦蜀往来要隘之地。许多英雄豪杰在这里留下了令人追怀的古迹。宝鸡郊外的姜成堡，相传是古代炎帝神农氏的故里。宝鸡县钓鱼乡的钓鱼台，则是古代军事家“姜子牙”从山东逃来隐居钓鱼的地方。汉高祖使用“明修栈道，暗度陈仓”的策略，在这里击败了项羽的大将。而宝鸡的得名，相传就是因秦文王游猎陈仓山，得到一只一声鸣数十里的宝鸡，才将陈仓改为宝鸡的。现在县内还有鸡鸣祠和斗鸡台的古迹。
    “这些传说，反映了人民渴望幸福的愿望。”市人民委员会的一位同志说：“可是，过去许多年代，人们可从没有听到什么宝鸡的叫啼！今天呢，人民却有了真正的宝鸡——那工厂的汽笛，那火车的鸣叫，不就是最好的宝鸡吗！它日日夜夜给人民报来幸福的喜讯！”
    幸福之路的起点
    离开市区，我来到渭水河滨。会合在这里的渭河、清姜河和金陵河的两岸，往来着数不清的人群和车辆。丰收的麦田里，飘扬着割麦竞赛的红旗。浩浩荡荡的渭河挟着浑浊的黄流，蜿蜒向东流去。这条曾养育过我们的祖先，灌溉过我国古代文化的河流上，高耸着雄伟的渭河大桥。深灰色的钢梁，在阳光下，闪耀发亮，宛如一道鲜艳的虹，横跨在渭河的水面上。
    这里是宝成铁路的起点。一列列火车，正鸣叫着穿过大桥，向秦岭山麓驶过。筑路指挥所的负责同志打开一张蓝色的线路平面图，指着弯弯曲曲的线路，对我说：
    “你看，铁路就是从这里，南跨渭河，沿着清姜河狭谷，向南盘旋上去的。然后，它越过秦岭、大巴山和古栈道，十六次跨过嘉陵江，跨过白水江、涪江等二十多条河流，经过陕西、甘肃、四川三省，沿凤县、黄沙河、略阳、阳平关、广元、雁门坝等地而到达成都。全线六百六十八公里，除了南段一百五十公里是平原外，其余全都是高山、峻岭和深谷。因此，全线平均不到三公里就有一座隧道，一公里就有一座半桥。工程十分艰巨，单是开挖和填筑的石头和泥土，若是垒成一公尺高，一公尺宽的堤坝，就可以绕地球赤道一点八周。平均每修一公里路，所填挖的石头泥土，就可以装五千多个火车皮。这样巨大的工程，不仅在中国是空前的；而且在世界筑路史上也是少有的。”
    接着，他又详细介绍了筑路经过。远在四十多年前，即1915年，就有人草测过同成铁路（山西大同到四川成都）。1936年，又有人用飞机测量了宝鸡到成都，和从甘肃天水到成都的两条铁路线路。在那以后，又勘察了两次。每次都因为秦岭的高峻，剑门的艰险，而中途停止了。但是，在人民的手里，只用了四年零十三天，就把铁路修通了。
    “这是一条艰巨的路，也是一条幸福的路。”他接着说：“修通了这条路，祖国西南的丰富出产就可以大量运出来，尤其可以把号称‘天府之国’的四川的大宗粮食，廉价运出供应全国各地工业城市和缺粮地区的需要。华东、东北、华北等地许多工业建筑器材和日用百货，也可以大量运进西南，支援内地建设。宝成铁路全线通车后，不仅可以减轻川江航运的负担，而且可以节省大量运费。每吨货物可以比用汽车运输降低运费十多元，过去从宝鸡乘汽车到成都要走四天，现在只要一昼夜就可以了。”
    沿着古代的道路
    火车离开渭河桥不远，就进入了秦岭山谷。过去曾是野兽出没、猿啼狼嚎的地方，如今却响起了汽笛的长鸣和??的列车声。
    沿着铁路，可以看到许多茅草屋和大大小小的工棚，不久前，这里还住满筑路工人，现在，多数工人都转移到新的工地，只留下少数人，在路基两旁堆砌护坡，栽种杨柳、马莲草，把铁路变得更加坚固美丽。
    车行二十多公里，进入兵家必争之地的“大散关”。“铁马秋风大散关”，这里两山陡绝，形势险要，写有“大散关”三字的古碑，巍立于山前。古代的石板路淹没在齐胸的荒草中间。宋代诗人陆游曾以“大散陈仓间，山川如盘劲”的诗句，来形容关隘的气势。唐朝天宝年间，安禄山作乱的时候，唐明皇行军经此进入四川。
    著名的古栈道“陈仓道”，以大散关为起点，唐罗邺大散关岭诗“过经长途日色稀，雪花如掌扑行衣，岭头却望人来处，特地身疑是鸟飞”，那时，我们的祖先，为着沟通川陕的道路，在万丈峭壁间凿开洞子，安上木桩，架起了木板，修起了“子午道”、“陈仓道”、“阴平道”、“剑门道”等惊险的古栈道。即使这样，他们仍然没有征服秦蜀天险。人们曾这样形容川陕道上的河山：
    断壁高接天，猴子锁眉尖；
    低头望山谷，白云脚下悬；
    凶山恶水多，蜀道如登天。
    几千年来，经过多少个朝代，河山未变，蜀道仍然是难于上青天，可是今天，在这“黄鹤之飞尚不过，猿猱欲渡愁攀缘”的地方，一条铁路联通了川陕，火车腾云驾雾一般，奔驰过峻峭的山巅。工人们用自己的双手，在短短的几年内，实现了我国人民几千年的理想和心愿！
