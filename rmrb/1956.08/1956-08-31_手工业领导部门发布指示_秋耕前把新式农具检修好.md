Xinhua News Agency, August 29th – The handicraft leadership departments require all levels of handicraft production cooperatives and farm tool repair stations to do a good job of inspecting and repairing new-style farm tools before the autumn ploughing.

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Union issued instructions on August 24 regarding the inspection and repair of new farm tools before the autumn harvest. The instructions stated that more than one million sets of double-wheeled double (single) furrow ploughs and other auxiliary new-style farm tools that have been promoted to farmers this year and last year will be put into autumn ploughing after this year's autumn harvest. To fully ensure the efficiency of these autumn ploughing farm tools, handicraft cooperatives must do a good job of farm tool repair.

The instructions pointed out that the national handicraft cooperative organizations have established approximately 20,000 farm tool repair stations with nearly 100,000 people participating in the repair work. The main problems currently facing the repair work are that the repair stations lack the necessary repair tools and the repair personnel do not understand the repair techniques for new-style farm tools. Therefore, while there is a repair network, it is unable to cope with the repair tasks of new farm tools. The phenomenon of new farm tools being broken and having nowhere to repair is still quite serious.

The instructions require that, in addition to assisting the agricultural departments in conducting technical inspections of new-style farm tools, the farm tool repair stations in various places should mainly be responsible for repairs, carrying out inspections and repairs simultaneously. This inspection and repair work should be carried out again this winter and next spring to prepare for next year's spring ploughing. Each province, county (city) must, during the autumn harvest process, based on the promotion of double-wheeled double (single) furrow ploughs in various places, hold several more training classes on new-style farm tool repair techniques to impart repair techniques to all repair stations. Regarding the repair equipment, each county (city) should, based on the needs of local repair work and in conjunction with the current economic situation of their units, add some manual tools for repair in a manner appropriate to local conditions. The supply of parts required for repair work can generally be met at present, but attention should be paid to preventing the phenomenon of accumulation here and shortages there.

The instructions also pointed out that the phenomenon of sprayers being broken and no one repairing them has also occurred in rural areas. Various places should actively find ways to inspect and repair the sprayers once this winter and next spring.

    手工业领导部门发布指示
    秋耕前把新式农具检修好
    新华社29日讯　手工业领导部门要求各级手工业生产联社和农具修配站在秋耕前做好新式农具的检修工作。
    中华全国手工业合作社联合总社筹备委员会在8月24日发出关于秋收前新农具检修工作的指示。指示中说，在今年和去年已经推广到农民手中的一百多万部双轮双（单）铧犁以及其他辅助的新式农具，在今年秋收以后将投入秋翻，为了充分保证这批秋耕农具的使用效率，手工业合作社必须把农具修配工作做好。
    指示指出，现在全国手工业合作组织约建立了两万个农具修配站，将近有十万人参加修配工作，修配工作当前的主要问题是修配站缺乏应有的修配工具，修配人员不懂得新式农具的修配技术，因而仅有了修配网，却无法应付新农具的修配任务，新农具坏了无处修的现象还是相当严重的。
    指示要求各地的农具修配站除了协助农业部门进行新式农具的技术检查以外，主要应负修配的责任，作到一边检查一边修理。这种检修工作在今冬明春还要再进行一次，迎接明年春耕。各省、县（市）必须在秋收过程中，根据各地双轮双（单）铧犁推广情况，再举办几次新式农具修配技术训练班，把修配技术传授到所有的修配站。关于修配的设备，各县（市）应根据当地修配工作的需要并结合目前本单位的经济情况，因地制宜地增添部分修配用的手工工具。对于修配工作所需要的零件，目前一般可以满足供应，但要注意防止这里积压、那里不足的现象。
    指示还指出，目前农村中还发生了喷雾器坏了无人修理的现象，各地应积极设法在今冬明春把喷雾器检修一次。
