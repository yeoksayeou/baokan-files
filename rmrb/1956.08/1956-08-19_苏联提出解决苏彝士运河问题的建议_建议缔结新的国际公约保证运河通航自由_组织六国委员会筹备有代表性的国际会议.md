Xinhua News Agency, London, August 18th: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke on the Suez Canal issue at the London Conference on the 17th.

The head of the Soviet delegation said in his speech: The Soviet Union firmly believes that the Suez Canal issue can be resolved as long as the sovereignty of all countries is respected and international cooperation is developed on the basis of equality and non-interference in internal affairs in the spirit of the times. Now it is necessary to adopt an objective and fair attitude towards the matter.

    The Nationalization of the Suez Canal Company Falls Within the Scope of the Internal Affairs of the Sovereign State of Egypt

Shepilov said that there are two aspects to the Suez Canal issue: the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and the freedom of navigation in the canal. The first aspect falls entirely within the internal jurisdiction of the sovereign state of Egypt. If we are to abide by the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, this issue cannot be discussed at any conference. The second aspect involves many countries. From the point of view of international law, it is a legitimate act for a country to nationalize property within its jurisdiction. When a country nationalizes property, it does not have to consider whether the owner of the property is a national citizen or a foreigner. This principle of international law has also been confirmed in a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1952.

The head of the Soviet delegation mentioned some examples of countries nationalizing companies with foreign capital. He then said: International law and the practice of many countries on the issue of property nationalization are very clear, and both aspects support Egypt's actions. He pointed out that the argument that the Suez Canal Company performs "international functions" in managing the canal and is therefore not subject to Egyptian state jurisdiction is unfounded.

Shepilov said that we believe that the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is acting within the scope of international law, and this issue falls within the internal authority of the autonomous Egyptian state and cannot be the subject of discussion at this conference or any other international conference.

    No Interference in Egypt's Internal Affairs is Permitted Under the Pretext of Freedom of Navigation

The Soviet Foreign Minister then spoke about the issue of freedom of navigation and the attitude of some Western countries. He said that the Suez Canal undeniably belongs to Egypt. At the same time, it cannot be denied that other countries have a great interest in the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is of great importance to Western and Eastern countries, and to international trade and world transportation. This interest is vividly reflected in the statements of the governments of various countries using the Suez Canal.

The Suez Canal is of particular importance to the economies of Europe, the Near East, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We are well aware of the interests of countries such as France and especially Britain in the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. The Soviet Union also has a great interest in the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and the normal operation of the canal.

Shepilov mentioned these words in President Nasser's statement: Egypt will continue to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal in the future, and the canal will continue to serve international trade as it has in the past. Egypt also stated that it will abide by the terms of the 1888 Convention and assume the responsibility of ensuring the normal operation of the canal.

There is currently an argument in the West that it is difficult for them to trust the current Egyptian government and Egyptian head of state, President Nasser. Shepilov said that this attitude towards international affairs is nothing more than a policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. In the present situation, this argument is being used as an excuse to infringe upon the rights of others and to infringe upon Egyptian property.

    Western Proposals to Establish International Management Institutions Do Not Take into Account the Actual Situation and Egyptian National Demands

He continued, facts have proven that some people are attempting to keep the management of the Suez Canal in foreign hands in the future, while kicking Egypt aside.

The head of the Soviet delegation mentioned the "Proposal on the Establishment of an International Management Institution for the Suez Canal" prepared by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States on August 7. Shepilov said that, of course, Mr. Dulles did not mention this document in his speech yesterday, and the position of the United States as explained in his speech was somewhat different. This "proposal" stipulates the establishment of an international institution for the Suez Canal, responsible for the administrative, economic, and technical management of the canal. We believe that, unfortunately, the above draft does not take into account the actual situation, nor does it take into account Egypt's just national demands.

Shepilov continued, the Soviet Union, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, the resolutions of the Bandung Conference attended by twenty-nine Asian and African countries, and international legal norms, cannot agree to regard a part of Egyptian territory through which the Suez Canal flows as territory where Egypt cannot exercise its sovereignty. Egypt is the sole and fully empowered owner of its own territory.

Establishing a "Suez Canal International Management Institution" is in fact restoring the original Suez Canal Company, but with a different signboard and the participation of some other countries. Establishing such an institution means allowing foreign capital to enjoy greater rights in Egypt than they enjoyed during the period when the 1866 Convention was in effect. The lease agreement at least stated that the validity period was ninety-nine years. The new plan for "international management of the canal" makes no mention of the validity period, which is obviously intended to make this management of the canal last forever.

    Egypt Must Participate in Formulating Measures to Provide Guarantees of Freedom of Navigation

Speaking about how to solve the Suez Canal issue, the Soviet Foreign Minister said: The Soviet Union is committed to consolidating world peace and hopes to create conditions so that the Suez Canal does not become a focus of conflict and disputes, but a link of friendship between peoples and a link of international trade. The development of international trade requires the prevention of conflicts and wars.

Only by correctly combining the national interests of all countries on the basis of respecting the sovereignty of all countries and the interests of international economic cooperation can existing differences between countries be resolved in a way that is in line with the interests of universal peace and can promote the establishment of healthy and normal relations between countries.

With this in mind, we must strive to resolve the issue of ensuring freedom of navigation and effective passage through the Suez Canal, making it a free, open, and safe route. Therefore, appropriate measures that can provide such guarantees should be formulated in an appropriate manner, with the necessary participation of Egypt, taking into account its rights and interests as a sovereign state, and taking into account the interests of the countries using the canal.

The current 1888 Convention stipulates freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, and as has already been mentioned, the Egyptian government guarantees to fulfill its obligations under this convention. In this regard, some countries have expressed opinions on guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal in the future and maintaining the normal operation of the canal. Thus, a question arises: considering the new situation and the spirit of the times, should a new international convention be concluded to replace the 1888 Convention, or should a supplementary agreement to the 1888 Convention be concluded in order to reaffirm and guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal while respecting Egyptian sovereignty? It should be noted that the Egyptian government has expressed its agreement to have a plenary conference of the countries concerned draft such a convention.

    A Just and Peaceful Solution Must Be Sought in Accordance with International Legal Norms and the United Nations Charter

The Soviet government believes that the following basic principles can serve as the basis for this international agreement.

The interests of all countries and peoples require that the current differences and frictions over the Suez Canal issue be resolved in a peaceful manner on a just basis in accordance with international legal norms and the principles of the United Nations.

At the same time, full consideration should be given to Egypt's inalienable sovereignty over the Suez Canal and the role of the Suez Canal as an important link in international trade and world transportation. This canal is used by many countries, all of whom are concerned about maintaining freedom of navigation in the canal.

The Suez Canal shall at all times remain free and open to merchant ships and warships of all countries on the basis of equality of tolls and port duties and equality of all navigational conditions.

Egypt, which possesses sovereignty over the canal and exercises jurisdiction over it, can undertake the obligation to take all necessary measures to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, to protect the canal and its buildings from any disruption of freedom of navigation, to maintain the canal in its proper condition in order to meet the requirements of navigation and to adapt to modern technical standards, and to carry out work to improve navigation conditions necessary to increase the Suez Canal's throughput capacity.

Some international figures have expressed concern that the current ship transit fees for the Suez Canal may suddenly increase. The issue of tax rates should be discussed with Egypt, and how to ensure the stability of tax rates should be studied, as well as what procedures are required in the event that some modifications to tax rates are needed for reasonable considerations of maintaining the normal and profitable operation of the canal.

The member states of the convention should reaffirm their current and still valid obligations, which are not to engage in any actions that would undermine the inviolability of the Suez Canal or cause material damage to the buildings, institutions, and engineering works on both banks of the canal under any circumstances. According to the provisions of the 1888 Convention, the Suez Canal should never become a battlefield; no hostile actions or actions that impede the freedom of navigation of the canal and its port entrances should be allowed; the canal should not be blockaded.

It is also possible to discuss with the Egyptian government how to arrange international cooperation in a manner acceptable to Egypt on matters related to the implementation of the Treaty on Freedom of Navigation in the Suez Canal. We believe that such cooperation would be beneficial to the matter. Of course, the condition for such cooperation is respect for Egypt's sovereignty and non-interference in Egypt's internal affairs. Some opinions that have already been expressed in this regard, such as those of India, are worth careful study.

We have always believed that Egypt, which is directly related to maintaining normal and uninterrupted canal navigation, will show the necessary attention to this and will help seek mutually understandable solutions to ensure freedom of navigation in the canal. This will also help to dispel the doubts that have recently arisen in some countries regarding the Suez Canal issue.

    Supports Egypt's Proposal to Convene an International Conference

The Soviet government believes that as long as the issue of what measures to take to ensure freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal is approached in this way, solutions acceptable to all countries concerned can be found, and the interests of peace and security in the Near East region can be reliably guaranteed.

We should start from the perspective that disputes must be resolved through negotiations and peaceful means. If the exchange of views at this conference can result in the formulation of some principles that are acceptable to everyone, then a representative conference of various countries can be convened to discuss specific solutions. The Egyptian government suggested on August 12 that a broad international conference on the Suez Canal be convened, inviting the signatory countries of the 1888 Convention and all countries using the canal to participate. The Soviet government supports this proposal and believes that this proposal is conducive to the work.

Specific issues regarding the membership, convening date, and location of the above-mentioned conference, as well as some other issues, can be resolved by a preparatory committee, which can be composed of representatives from, for example, the following countries: Egypt, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union.

Shepilov finally hoped that the participants in the London Conference would strive to contribute to the cause of easing international tensions in the Near East and the cause of world peace.

    苏联提出解决苏彝士运河问题的建议
    建议缔结新的国际公约保证运河通航自由
    组织六国委员会筹备有代表性的国际会议
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫十七日在讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议上发言。
    苏联代表团团长在发言中说：苏联深信，只要尊重各国主权并且根据时代的精神在平等和不干涉内政的基础上发展国际合作，就可以解决苏彝士运河问题。现在必须对事情采取客观的公平的态度。
    苏彝士运河公司国有化问题属于主权国家埃及的内政范围
    谢皮洛夫说，苏彝士运河问题有两个方面：苏彝士运河公司国有化问题和运河航行自由的问题。第一个方面完全属于有主权的埃及国家的内部管辖范围。如果我们要遵守不干涉内政的原则，这一问题就不可以在任何会议上加以讨论。第二个方面牵涉到许多国家。从国际法的观点来看，一个国家在自己管辖的领土内把财产收归国有，是一个合法的行为。一个国家把财产收归国有的时候，不必管这个财产的所有者是本国公民或是外国人。国际法的这一原则也在联合国大会1952年通过的一个决议里得到了确认。
    苏联代表团团长提到了一些国家把有外国资本的公司收归国有的一些事例。他接着说道：国际法和许多国家在财产国有化问题上的做法都是十分明确的，这两方面的情况都支持了埃及的行动。他指出那种认为苏彝士运河公司在管理运河方面执行“国际职能”因此不受埃及国家管辖的论调是没有根据的。
    谢皮洛夫说，我们认为埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有是在国际法范围之内行事的，这个问题属于自主的埃及国家内部权限范围，不能作为本会议或任何其他国际会议的讨论对象。
    不容许借口航行自由干涉埃及内政
    苏联外交部长接着谈到航行自由问题和某些西方国家的态度。他说，苏彝士运河无可争辩地属于埃及。同时不能否认其他国家对苏彝士运河航行自由是有很大利害关系的，苏彝士运河对西方国家和东方国家，对国际贸易和世界交通都是有很重要意义的。在使用苏彝士运河的各国政府的声明中鲜明地反映了这种利害关系。
    苏彝士运河对欧洲、中近东、东南亚各国的经济有特别重要意义。我们很了解像法国、特别是英国这样一些国家对苏彝士运河航行自由的利害关系。苏联对苏彝士运河航行自由和运河的正常通航也是有很大利害关系的。
    谢皮洛夫提到纳赛尔总统声明中的这些话：埃及今后仍将保证苏彝士运河通航自由，运河仍将同过去一样不断地为国际贸易联系服务。埃及同时声明，它将遵守1888年公约的条款，负担起保障运河正常通航的责任。
    西方目前有一种论调说：它们很难相信目前的埃及政府和埃及国家元首纳赛尔总统。谢皮洛夫说，这种对国际事务的态度，不外是一种干涉他国内政的政策。在目前的场合，这种论调被利用作为侵犯他人权利、侵犯埃及财产的借口。
    建立国际管理机构的西方建议没有考虑到实际情况和埃及民族要求
    他继续说，事实证明，有人企图将来仍把苏彝士运河管理权保持在外国手里，而一脚踢开埃及。
    苏联代表团团长提到英、法、美三国代表八月七日准备好的“关于成立苏彝士运河国际管理机构的建议”。谢皮洛夫说，固然，杜勒斯先生在昨天的发言中没有提到这个文件，他在发言中所说明的美国的立场也有一些不同。这个“建议”规定成立一个苏彝士运河国际机构，负责在行政、经济和技术方面管理运河。我们认为，遗憾的是，上述草案既没有考虑到实际情况，也没有考虑到埃及的公正的民族要求。
    谢皮洛夫接着说，苏联本着联合国宪章的原则、本着有二十九个亚非国家参加的万隆会议的决议以及国际法准则，不能同意把苏彝士运河流经的一部分埃及领土看作是不能行使埃及主权的领土。埃及是自己的领土的唯一的全权主人。
    建立“苏彝士运河国际管理机构”事实上就是恢复原来的苏彝士运河公司，只不过换了个招牌，又有某些别的国家参加而已。设立这样的机构意味着让外国资本在埃及享受更大的权利，比它们在1866年公约有效期间所享有的权利还大。在租借协定中至少还说明，有效期为九十九年。而“国际管理运河”的新方案对有效期只字未提，这显然是打算使这种对运河的管理永世长存。
    必须有埃及参加制定提供通航自由保证的措施
    苏联外交部长谈到如何解决苏彝士运河问题时说：苏联致力于巩固世界和平，希望创造条件，使苏彝士运河不致成为冲突和纠纷的焦点，而成为人民友谊的纽带、国际贸易的纽带，而国际贸易的发展则要求防止冲突和战争。
    只有在尊重各国主权和国际经济合作的利益的基础上正确地把各国的民族利益结合起来，才能够使各国间现存的分歧求得这样一种解决，这种解决符合于普遍和平的利益，可以促进建立各国间健康的正常关系。
    正是考虑到这一点，必须争取解决有关确保苏彝士运河航行自由和有效的通航，使之成为自由、开放、安全的航线的问题。因此，应当以适当的方式，在一定要有埃及参加的情况下，并且考虑到它作为主权国家的权利和利益以及考虑到使用运河的各国利益，来制定能够提供这种保证的适当措施。
    现行的1888年公约规定苏彝士运河航行自由，正如已经提到过，埃及政府保证履行自己对这个公约的义务。在这方面一些国家谈到在将来保证苏彝士运河航行自由以及维持运河正常状态的意见。于是，产生一个问题：考虑到新形势和时代精神，缔结一个新的国际公约来代替1888年公约或者是缔结1888年公约的补充协定，以便在尊重埃及主权的情况下重申和保证苏彝士运河航行自由。应当注意到，埃及政府已经表示同意由有关国家的全权会议拟定这种公约。
    必须根据国际法准则和联合国宪章求得公正而和平的解决办法
    苏联政府认为下列基本原则可以作为这个国际协定的基础。
    一切国家和人民的利益要求，目前在苏彝士运河问题上发生的分歧和摩擦能够根据国际法准则和联合国原则在公正的基础上用和平的方式求得解决。
    同时应当充分考虑到埃及对苏彝士运河的不可剥夺的主权和苏彝士运河作为国际贸易及世界交通的一个重要的环节所起的作用，这条运河是有许多国家使用的，它们都关心维持运河航行自由。
    苏彝士运河将在通行税和港口税平等以及一切通航条件平等的基础上对一切国家的商船和军用船只都始终保持自由开放。
    对运河拥有主权和对它实行管辖的埃及可以承担这样的义务：采取一切必要的措施来保证苏彝士运河通航自由，保护运河和它的建筑物以防止对航行自由的任何破坏，保持运河的应有状况，以满足航行的要求和适应现代的技术水平，进行工作来改善对提高苏彝士运河通过能力所必要的航行条件。
    某些国际人士表示担心，苏彝士运河现行的船只通行税是否可能突然提高。应该同埃及讨论关于税率的问题，研究如何保证税率的稳定，研究一旦为了维持运河经营的正常和赢利这种合理考虑而需要对税率作某种修改时，需要经过什么手续。
    公约成员国应该重申它们所担负的现在仍然有效的义务，就是在任何情况下不进行会破坏苏彝士运河的不可侵犯性或者会给运河两岸的建筑物、机关和工程造成物质损失的行动。根据1888年公约中的条款，苏彝士运河决不应成为战场；决不允许发生任何敌对行动或者妨碍运河及其入口港的航行自由的行动；运河不应该受到封锁。
    也可以同埃及政府讨论，在同履行苏彝士运河航行自由条约有关的事务上，如何以埃及所能接受的方式安排国际合作。我们认为，这种合作是会对事情有利的。当然，这种合作的条件是要尊重埃及的主权和不干涉埃及内政。关于这一方面已经表示的某些意见，例如印度的意见，是值得仔细研究的。
    我们一直认为，在保持正常的、不间断的运河航行上直接有关的埃及，将对此表现出必要的注意，并且将协助谋求保证在保障运河航行自由问题上的互相谅解的办法。这也将有助于消除最近在某些国家对苏彝士运河问题所产生的疑虑。
    支持埃及召开国际会议的建议
    苏联政府认为，只要这样来对待采取什么措施保证苏彝士运河航行自由的问题，就可以找出有关各国都可以接受的解决办法，并且可以可靠地保证中近东地区和平和安全的利益。
    应当从必须通过谈判、用和平的办法解决争端这个角度出发。如果在这次会议上交换意见的结果能够制定某些大家可以接受的原则，那么就可以召开各国有代表性的会议来商讨具体的解决办法。埃及政府八月十二日曾经建议召开一次广泛的苏彝士运河国际会议，邀请1888年公约的签字国和利用运河的所有国家参加。苏联政府支持这个建议，认为这个建议是有利于工作的。
    关于上述会议的成员、召集日期和地点的具体问题和其他一些问题，可以由一个筹备委员会来解决，这个委员会可以由，例如，下列国家的代表组成：埃及、印度、美国、英国、法国、苏联。
    谢皮洛夫最后希望伦敦会议的参加者努力对缓和近东国际紧张局势的事业和世界和平事业作出贡献。
