Xinhua News Agency, London, August 14th: The British Labour Party's "Shadow Cabinet" issued a statement after holding a special meeting on August 13, stating that "the use of armed forces against Egypt in the Suez Canal issue cannot be considered justified unless it complies with the obligations and guarantees we [Britain] have undertaken under the United Nations Charter." The statement also said that "in view of public unease," the government should make it clear that the military measures taken in the past "are not in preparation for...armed intervention."

The Labour Party, which had previously expressed "firm" support for the Conservative government's position on the Suez Canal issue, now believes that the primary purpose of the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue "should be to develop a plan to ensure the effective use and development of the canal." This plan "should be linked to the United Nations."

The Labour leaders also requested that Parliament, which was originally scheduled to reconvene on October 23, reconvene earlier to discuss the Suez Canal issue after the London Conference.

This statement by the Labour Party's "Shadow Cabinet" was issued amid widespread opposition from all sectors of British society, including Labour and Liberal Party politicians, to the government's use of force. There are also reports that, in addition to Labour leaders, Liberal Party leaders and even some within the Conservative Party are demanding that the government submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations for resolution. They fear that if other countries raise the issue with the United Nations first, Britain will be branded with the crime of "threatening peace."

    英工党领袖反对武装干涉埃及
    主张把伦敦会议制定的计划同联合国发生联系
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党“在野内阁”八月十三日在举行一次特别会议后发表声明说，
  “除非符合我们（英国）根据联合国宪章所承担的义务和所作出的保证”，否则，不能认为在苏彝士运河问题上对埃及使用武装部队是正当的。声明还说，“鉴于社会人士的不安”，政府应当表明，过去所采取的军事措施“不是为……武装干涉作准备”。
    曾经表示过“坚定地”支持保守党政府在苏彝士运河问题上的立场的工党，现在认为，关于苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议的首要目的，“应当是制定计划，保证运河有效的使用和发展”。这个计划“应该同联合国发生联系”。
    工党的领袖们还要求本来应当在十月二十三日才复会的议会提早复会，以便在伦敦会议后讨论苏彝士运河问题。
    工党“在野内阁”的这个声明是在包括工党和自由党政界人士的英国各界人士纷纷反对政府使用武力的情况下发表的。还有消息说，除工党领袖外，自由党领袖甚至保守党内部也有人要求政府把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国处理。他们担心，如果别的国家先提到联合国去，英国就会背上“威胁和平”的罪名。
