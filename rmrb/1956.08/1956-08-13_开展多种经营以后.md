　　After Developing Diversified Economy
　　By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

　　Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, produces rice, as well as a large quantity of tea, hemp, oil, paper, medicinal herbs, and other local and special products. Every year, these local and special products, along with other rural sideline occupations, account for 30% to 40% of farmers' total income, and in some cases, up to 50%.

　　However, at the beginning of this year, in the face of the mass production upsurge, the county committee leaders made a one-sided mistake, neglecting the leadership and development of local and special products and other sideline production. Everyone was intoxicated by the agricultural production increase plans on paper.

　　In March and April, the following situation occurred throughout the county: agricultural cooperatives needed money, and members also needed money, but no one had money. At that time, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county needed a total of 1.8 million yuan in production funds, and after using all possible methods, including state loans, 700,000 yuan still could not be raised. This situation directly affected the production and lives of the members. In the Red Star Cooperative, eight poor members did not have money to buy food, and five households relied solely on sweet potatoes to survive, so everyone was reluctant to work. During the busy spring plowing season, sixteen members of the Yuyuan Agricultural Cooperative did not have salt to eat, and there was plenty of salt on the market, but they did not have money to buy it. For the same reason, in the Mishan Agricultural Cooperative, the daily attendance rate of more than eighty laborers in the whole cooperative only reached 60%; and each of those who attended work only earned an average of seven work points per day. Supply and marketing cooperatives had prepared many small farm tools, non-staple foods, and daily necessities, but not many people bought them. At that time, signs of economic stagnation appeared both in the agricultural cooperatives and in the market.

　　In April, the financial and economic departments of Pingjiang County took emergency measures, using increased agricultural loans and vigorously purchasing local and special products, and invested a large amount of funds in the countryside in a short period. This was a powerful support for the farmers and agricultural cooperatives who were generally short of money at that time, and it was an important factor in revitalizing the rural economy of Pingjiang. However, this could not fundamentally solve the problem. From the end of April, the Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and party organizations at all levels, with the support of state funds, devoted all their efforts to lead the agricultural cooperatives to vigorously develop diversified management with agriculture as the mainstay.

　　In the Donggao Agricultural Cooperative, the cooperative leaders originally blindly believed that as long as rice production reached 1,000 jin per mu, the cooperative would be guaranteed to increase income. The leadership helped them calculate several accounts: according to the revised plan, the total agricultural income of this cooperative could reach more than 76,000 yuan. However, after deducting state taxes, repaying agricultural loans, and production expenses, the net income was only more than 55,000 yuan; if distributed to more than 300 households, with more than 1,100 people, each person would only receive more than 47 yuan. Then look at the situation last year when the members did not participate in the advanced cooperative. According to a survey of 150 households, at that time, because farmers had sideline income from raising pigs, raising fish, and collecting firewood, the average middle peasant could earn more than 60 yuan per year, and the poor peasants also earned around 45 yuan, with an average of around 52 yuan. If the cooperative does not increase income, the members will generally have reduced income. Moreover, the living standard of farmers last year was very low. This year, according to the requirements of improving the living of the members at a minimum, they must increase income by more than 15,000 yuan to meet the requirements of the members. After such calculations, the leaders of the agricultural cooperative were greatly surprised. From the cooperative cadres to the members, everyone agreed that in addition to doing a good job in agricultural production, they must greatly develop sideline occupations to increase the income of more than 90% of the members. On this basis, this cooperative quickly and comprehensively revised the agricultural and sideline production plan and actively took action.

　　The Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China successively helped more than a dozen agricultural cooperatives to specifically calculate accounts, breaking the idea of being satisfied with agricultural income, and achieved results. After transplanting rice seedlings, diversified management was listed as the central task of the agricultural cooperatives throughout the county. They organized seventeen agricultural cooperative leaders with experience in developing diversified management and established a "Diversified Management Mobile Guidance Group" to go to places with relatively weak work foundations, share their experiences, and provide specific guidance. In this way, many cooperative cadres who originally lacked leadership methods for developing diversified management learned methods; those who had not engaged in sideline occupations originally also started doing so. When many agricultural cooperatives obtained the first cash income from sideline occupations, the enthusiasm of the vast number of members for agricultural and sideline production was even higher.

　　No one had experience in agricultural cooperatives collectively managing sideline occupations in the past; many new problems arose. Several responsible comrades of the Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China continuously went deep into key townships and cooperatives to continuously discover and solve problems. In May, they adopted the method of overall planning and "linking up" with relevant departments to overcome the blindness of managing sideline occupations that had occurred at one time. A quota management plan for diversified management was generally formulated in agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, solving the problem of unreasonable remuneration for sideline labor, which affected the enthusiasm of members for production. In order to overcome the phenomenon of some cooperatives putting the cart before the horse and losing sight of the other in agricultural and sideline production, all cooperatives carried out labor planning, rationally arranged the labor force engaged in agriculture and sideline occupations; at the same time, they also strengthened technical guidance and financial management.

　　At that time, all the large and small sideline productions were uniformly managed by the cooperatives. Some cooperatives proposed "no private sideline occupations are allowed." The Samsung Agricultural Cooperative stipulated that each member should hand over three chickens to the cooperative and required them to be handed over within three days. At that time, more than 500 cooperatives concentrated all the chickens and ducks raised privately by the members and uniformly managed them by the cooperatives. When the members of the United Cooperative heard the news that the chickens and ducks were to be concentrated, they slaughtered more than 130 chickens in one night. The Yuni Agricultural Cooperative concentrated more than 200 pigs of the members and uniformly raised them by the cooperative; for this reason, the cooperative spent 400 yuan to build a new pigsty; and the 100 pigsties scattered in various households were left unused. Some cooperatives uniformly managed poultry and livestock, due to lack of experience and management techniques, a large number died.

　　Not only that, many cooperatives also concentrated and unified the members' family spinning, making straw sandals, and children catching loach and other sporadic sideline occupations. Because everything emphasized unified management, the members' working hours were tightly arranged by the cooperative. A member of the Banshan Cooperative was criticized by the cooperative and had one of his already earned labor days deducted because he took half a day to weave the fence for the vegetable garden.

　　The leaders of the cooperative did this with good intentions. They believed that everything would have advantages as long as it was done collectively, and that concentrating all sideline occupations could increase the income of the members. They did not understand that some sporadic sideline occupations are more convenient and beneficial for members to manage individually than collectively. This approach planted a serious danger for the development of diversified management.

　　Under the instructions of the higher-level party committee, the Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the opportunity to solve this urgent problem in June. In addition to criticizing this wrong practice and raising the ideological awareness of party members in various meetings inside and outside the party, the county committee also took emergency measures in specific work. Party organizations at all levels helped the agricultural cooperatives to uniformly rank all sideline occupations, and the members discussed and decided which sideline occupations should be managed by the cooperative and which sideline occupations should be managed by the members individually. The leaders of the cooperatives who made mistakes in using coercive orders in their work also made self-criticisms to the members. The county committee also suggested that each agricultural cooperative should give the members two months of time each year to be disposed of by individuals, so that the members can better deal with family life and individual sideline production according to their personal needs.

　　Now, after preliminary calculations, all 1,659 agricultural cooperatives in Pingjiang County can increase the income of 90% of the members. The rural economy has become more active. The county committee was not satisfied with these achievements. Recently, they found that although some agricultural cooperatives have increased income, it is not significant, and most members have only increased income by five to ten yuan compared to last year; and in general, agricultural cooperatives still have great potential to be tapped in agricultural and sideline production. The county committee put forward the slogan "Strive to increase the income of 90% of the members by 20% to 30%." This slogan has become the goal of struggle for every agricultural cooperative.

    开展多种经营以后
    本报记者　高长任
    湖南省平江县出产稻谷，也出产大量的茶、麻、油、纸、药材等土产和特产。每年，这些土产和特产和农村其他副业都占农民总收入的30％到40％，多的达到50％。
    可是，今年年初在群众性的生产高潮前面，县委的领导犯了片面性的毛病，忽视了领导和发展土产特产和别的副业生产。大家都被纸上的农业增产计划陶醉了。
    三、四月份，在全县范围内发生了这样一种局面：农业社要钱用，社员也要钱用，可是大家都没有钱。那时，全县农业社共需要180万元生产资金，用了一切办法，包括国家贷款在内，还有七十万元筹集不起来。这种局面直接影响了社员的生产和生活，红星社有八户贫困社员，没有钱买口粮，有五户只靠红薯维持生活，大家就懒得出工了。裕源农业社在春耕紧张的时候，有十六户社员没有盐吃，市场上有很多盐，可是他们没钱买。米山农业社因为同样的原因，全社八十多个劳动力，每天的出勤率只达到60％；这部分出勤的人，每个人每天平均只做七个工分。供销社里准备了不少小农具、副食品和生活用品，但是买的人不多。当时，不论在农业社里，在市场上，都出现了经济停滞的迹象。
    四月，平江县财经部门曾采取紧急措施，运用增加农贷，大力收购土产特产的办法，在短时期内投放了很大一笔资金到农村。这对当时普遍缺钱的农民和农业社，是一个有力的支持，是活跃平江农村经济的一个重要因素。但是，这还不能从根本上解决问题。从四月底起，中共平江县委和各级党组织，就全力领导农业社，利用国家资金的支援，大力开展以农业为主的多种经营。
    在东皋农业社，社的领导人原来盲目地认为只要稻谷千斤丰产，全社就可保证增加收入。领导方面就帮助他们算了几笔账：这个社按照修订后的计划来计算农业总收入可以达到七万六千多元。但是除去国家税收，归还农贷和生产资金的开支以后，纯收入只有五万五千多元；如果分配到三百多户，一千一百多口人手中，每人只可分到四十七元多。再看看去年社员没有参加高级社的情况。据一百五十户的调查，那时因为农民有喂猪，养鱼、打柴等副业收入，一般中农每人全年可收入六十元以上，贫农也在四十五元左右，平均数是五十二元左右。如果合作社不增加收入，社员是要普遍减少收入的。而且去年农民生活水平是很低的，今年按照最低限度改善社员生活的要求来计算，还得增加一万五千多元的收入，才能满足社员的要求。这样一算，农业社的领导人员才大吃一惊。从社干部到社员一致认为：除了把农业生产搞好，还要大大发展副业，才能使90％以上的社员增加收入。在这个基础上，这个社很快就全面修订了农副业生产计划，并积极行动起来。
    中共平江县委先后帮助十多个农业社具体地算了账，打破了满足于农业收入的思想，并且做出了成绩。插秧以后，就在全县范围内，把开展多种经营列为农业社的中心工作。他们组织了十七个开展多种经营有经验的农业社长，成立“多种经营巡回辅导团”，到工作基础比较薄弱的地方去，现身说法，具体辅导。这样，许多原来缺少领导开展多种经营工作方法的社干部，学到了办法；原来没有搞副业的，也搞起来了。许多农业社从副业中获得第一笔现金收入的时候，广大社员对于农副业生产的热情就更高了。
    农业社集体来经营副业，过去谁也没有经验；许多新的问题发生了。中共平江县委几个负责同志连续深入重点乡、社，不断发现和解决问题。五月份，他们采取全面规划并和有关部门“挂钩”的办法，克服了一度发生的经营副业的盲目性问题。在全县农业社普遍制定多种经营的定额管理方案，解决了副业劳动报酬不合理，影响社员生产积极性的问题。为了克服有些社在农业和副业生产上轻重倒置和顾此失彼的现象，各个社都进行了劳动规划，合理安排了从事农业和副业的劳动力；同时，也加强了技术指导和财务管理工作。
    当时，大大小小的副业生产，都是由社里统一经营的。有些社里提出“不准私人搞副业”。三星农业社规定：每个社员要交给社里三只鸡，并限定三天之内交齐。当时有五百多个社都把社员私人喂的鸡鸭全部集中起来，由社统一经营。联合社的社员听说要集中鸡鸭的消息，一个晚上就杀了一百三十多只。淤泥农业社把社员的二百多头猪集中起来，由社统一喂养；为此，社里花四百元新盖一个猪栏；而分散在各户的一百个猪栏就闲着不用了。有些社由社统一经营的家禽家畜，由于缺乏经验和管理技术，大批死亡。
    不仅如此，有不少社把社员家庭中的纺纱、打草鞋、小孩子捉鳅鱼等零星副业，也都集中统一了。由于事事强调统一经营，社员们的劳动时间，就被社里安排得紧紧的。半山社有个社员抽半天时间编菜园子的篱笆，就受到社内的批评，还被扣去他已得的一个劳动日。
    社里的领导人员这样做，原是一片好心。他们认为什么事情只要集体搞就有优越性，一切副业集中，就可以使社员增加收入。他们不了解：有些零星副业，由社员个人经营比集体经营更为方便，更为有利。这种做法给多种经营的开展埋伏下一个严重的危险。
    在上级党委指示下，中共平江县委在六月份就抓紧解决这个迫切的问题。县委除了在党内外各种会议上批判这种错误做法，提高党员的思想之外，在具体工作中，还采取了紧急措施。各级党组织都帮助农业社把各项副业统一排队，由社员讨论决定，哪些副业由社经营，哪些副业由社员个人经营。在工作中犯了强迫命令错误的社的领导人员，也都向社员作了检讨。县委还建议各个农业社，今后每年都要给社员两个月由个人支配的时间，让社员根据个人需要，更好地处理家庭生活和个人的副业生产。
    现在，平江县1，659个农业社经过初步计算，都可以做到90％的社员增加收入。农村经济更加活跃起来了。县委并没有满足这些成绩。最近，他们发现有些农业社虽然增加收入，但并不显著，大部分社员只比去年增加收入五元到十元；而一般农业社在农副业生产上还是有很大潜力可以发挥的。县委提出了“争取90％的社员增加20％到30％的收入”的口号。这口号已成为各个农业社的奋斗目标。
