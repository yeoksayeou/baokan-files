    The Fertile Hanzhong Basin
    Zhang Yuxiu
    Going south from the Guanzhong area, after crossing the Qinling Mountains, a very beautiful area appears, which is what people call the "Little Jiangnan" of Shaanxi Province – the Hanzhong Basin.

    The Hanzhong Basin is evergreen all year round. The Han River flows eastward calmly, lapping against the duck flocks and fishing boats raised by the agricultural cooperatives along the banks. On both sides, there are green rice paddies everywhere, patches of orange groves, and rows and rows of Chinese parasol trees.

    This is a fertile place. In addition to producing rice and wheat, there are also a wide variety of local and special products. Here you can find gallnuts, tea, raw silk, pig bristles, deer antler, musk, tung oil, lacquer, various fruits, and the famous palm boxes, which are sold at home and abroad. These are the main sources of income for local farmers. According to statistics, the income from local and special products in the Hanzhong area accounts for 30%-40% of the total income. This year, the Hanzhong Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has specially established a sideline production office to lead the masses in developing sideline production. It is understood that the sideline production of various agricultural cooperatives has increased. The Tongxin Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in the Mian County tea area saw its income from local and special products account for 40% of the cooperative's total income last year; this year, income from local and special products will increase by 30% compared to last year.

    Speaking of oranges, people think of them as a fruit produced in southern China. In fact, large orange groves can be seen everywhere in Hanzhong, especially in the mountains, which are full of wild orange trees.

    We visited Shengxian Village in Chenggu County. Orange groves are everywhere in front of, behind, to the left, and to the right of the village; the mountains near the village are also full of wild orange trees and loquats. Every orange tree is covered with green oranges. The old people in the village all say: this year's oranges will be another bumper harvest. It is estimated that the village will harvest more than 40,000 catties of oranges this year.

    Among the young people in this village, fifty-eight have learned eleven new technologies such as cultivation and grafting, and five of them have been named orange-growing models. Led by these young people, new technologies have been adopted in all the orange groves in the village. The village also has a "Youth Experimental Orange Garden," which is a newly cultivated orange garden about one mu in size. In this orange garden, there are orange trees from Sichuan, mandarin trees from Guangdong...

    We also visited agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Mian County and Zhenba. Each agricultural cooperative here operates ten to twenty kinds of sideline businesses. The members of the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Mian County came up with ideas and decided to engage in ten sideline productions this year: planting palm trees (for collecting palm fibers), burning charcoal, raising ducks, picking fungus, digging medicinal herbs, weaving bamboo products, weaving straw sandals, hunting, and blacksmithing. This year, sideline income will account for more than 40% of the total income of the whole cooperative.

    In the Bashan Mountains, you can see young people hunting, digging medicinal herbs, and peeling palm bark...; on the Han River, you can see young people raising flocks of ducks. In the Mengzi District of Zhenba County, we visited a youth hunting team. This team has a total of eleven people, each of whom can both farm and hunt. They go to the fields when it is the busy farming season and go to the mountains when it is slack. There is a twenty-one-year-old young hunter in this group named Wei Wencai, who killed more than thirty wild animals by himself last autumn, including bears, roe deer, musk deer, and wild boars. Wei Wencai told us that you must have experience in everything you do; hunting not only requires you to be good at shooting, but also requires you to understand the laws of wild animal activity – it is certain what wild animals are active in what place in what season. After understanding the laws of their activities throughout the year, you must also learn the techniques of hunting various wild animals, and you must understand "kill a pig or bear in one breath, hunt deer or roe deer in one act." Wei Wencai has taught the hunting team all his knowledge of hunting beasts; this team has achieved excellent results in hunting every year.

    The Hanzhong Basin is fertile, and the people of Hanzhong are using this favorable natural condition to create wealth for the country and build a happy life for themselves.

    富饶的汉中盆地
    张毓秀
    从关中地区向南，翻过秦岭之后，就出现了一个非常秀丽的地区，这就是人们所说的陕西省的“小江南”——汉中盆地。
    汉中盆地四季长青，汉水平静地向东流去，冲击着沿岸各个农业社喂养的鸭群和鱼舟。在两岸，到处是绿油油的稻田，成片的橘林，一行一行的梧桐。
    这是一个富饶的地方。除了盛产稻米、小麦之外，还有种类繁多的土产和特产。这里有远销国内外的五倍子、茶、生丝、猪鬃、鹿茸、麝香、桐油、漆、各种水果和著名的棕箱等等。这些都是当地农民主要的收入来源。据统计，汉中专区土产特产的收入占总收入的30％—40％。今年，中共汉中地委专门成立了副业生产办公室，领导群众开展副业生产。据了解，各农业社的副业生产都增加了。沔县茶区的同心高级社，去年土产特产的收入占社的总收入的40％；今年，土产特产收入比去年还要提高30％。
    说起橘子，人们都认为这是我国南方出产的一种水果。其实，汉中到处都可以看到大片大片的橘林，特别是在山上，满山都是野生的橘树。
    我们曾访问过城固县升仙村。村前村后村左村右到处是橘林；村附近的山上，也长满了野生的橘树和枇杷。每棵橘树上，都挂上了绿色的橘子。村里老年人们都说：今年的橘子又要丰收了。预计今年全村要收获四万多斤橘子。
    这个村子的青年中，有五十八个人学会了栽培、嫁接等十一种新技术，其中有五个青年被评为种橘模范。由这些青年带头，在全村的橘林里都采用了新技术。这个村还有“青年试验橘园”，是一块一亩大小的新培植起来的橘园。在这块橘园里，有四川的橘树，有广东的柑树……。
    我们还访问了沔县、镇巴等县的农业社。这里的每个农业社都经营着十几种到二十多种副业。沔县新光农业社的社员们出主意想办法，决定今年经营种植棕树（采棕用）、烧木炭、养鸭、摘木耳、挖药材、编竹器、编草鞋、打猎、打铁等十种副业生产。今年，副业收入将占全社总收入的40％以上。
    在巴山上，可以看到青年们在打猎、挖药材、剥棕皮……；在汉江上，可以看到青年们喂养的鸭群。在镇巴县菛子区，我们访问了一个青年打猎小组。这个小组共有十一个人，每个人都是又会种田又会打猎，农忙的时候就下田，农闲就上山。这个组有一个二十一岁的青年猎人魏文才，去年秋天，一个人就打死了三十多只野兽，有狗熊、麂子、麝子、野猪等。魏文才对我们说，干什么事也得有经验；打猎不仅要求你枪法好，还要求懂得野兽活动的规律——什么野兽什么季节活动在什么地方是一定的。懂得了它们一年四季活动的规律之后，还要学会打各种野兽的技术，要懂得“打猪打熊一口气，打鹿打麂一场戏”。魏文才把打兽的知识都教给打猎小组了；这个小组，每年打猎的成绩都很出色。
    汉中盆地是富饶的，汉中人民正利用这个有利的自然条件，为国家创造财富，为自己建设幸福的生活。
