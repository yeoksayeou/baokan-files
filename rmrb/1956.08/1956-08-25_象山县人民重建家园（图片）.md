    The People of Xiangshan County Rebuild Their Homes
    Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, which was severely hit by a strong typhoon, is now continuing various post-disaster recovery efforts. Under the care of the Party and the People's Government, all disaster-stricken people have been properly resettled. Many have begun to resume production and rebuild their homes on the flood-ravaged land.

    The Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the people of Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, who suffered from the typhoon disaster. Shortly after the typhoon, a large amount of supplies from all sides to support the people of Xiangshan arrived at Xiangshan Port. This is a corner of Xiangshan Port, filled with relief supplies.
    These are members of the Hedong No. 2 Cooperative of Linhai Township, Xiangshan County, which was severely affected by the strong typhoon disaster, turning over and drying the rescued rice. In just over two days, they dried more than 150,000 jin of the more than 300,000 jin of rice they rescued.
    The masses in Xiangshan County are beginning to repair damaged houses and rebuild their homes. This is Yang Cijin, a member of the Yangjia Agricultural Cooperative in Nanxiang Village, repairing a house destroyed by wind and rain.

    党和人民政府非常关怀受台风灾害的浙江省象山县人民。在台风过后不久，各方面支援象山人民的大批物资源源地运到了象山港。这是堆满救济物资的象山港码头一角。
    这是受强台风灾害比较严重的象山县林海乡河东二社的社员们在翻晒抢救出来的稻谷。他们在两天多的时间内，把抢救出来的三十多万斤稻谷，晒好了十五万多斤。
    象山县的群众正在着手修理被毁的房屋，重建家园。这是南乡庄杨家农业社的社员杨祠金在修理被风雨摧毁的房子。
