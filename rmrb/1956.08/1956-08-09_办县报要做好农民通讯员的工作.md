To Run a County Newspaper Well, Do a Good Job of Farmer Correspondents
Liu Kai

The main audience of county newspapers is farmers. Broadly absorbing farmers into the work of the county newspaper should be a natural thing. However, some county newspapers are not doing this now. Why? Some say: "The county newspaper has a small page size and a long publication cycle, and it doesn't use many articles per issue. It can be published without strengthening mass work." Some say: "Fewer cadres in the editorial department means it's necessary to rely on the masses to run the newspaper; more cadres means it's possible to rely less on the masses, or even not rely on them at all." Others believe: "Newspaper work is writing work, and farmers can't read, so they can't be relied upon," "Relying on farmer correspondents is like trying to put out a fire with water from afar." These kinds of erroneous understandings hinder the development of mass work in county newspapers and affect the improvement of newspaper quality. The winding path taken by the "Xiaoshan Newspaper" in Zhejiang powerfully illustrates this point.

In the early days of the "Xiaoshan Newspaper," the editorial department did not pay much attention to mass work. They rarely contacted activists who proactively submitted articles and letters, and they even looked down on the farmers. In the four months after the newspaper was founded, they didn't develop a single correspondent. Although the four staff members who edited the newspaper were very busy, sometimes one person had to ride a bicycle to several townships to conduct interviews in a single day, the newspaper was not run well – the pages were often filled with lengthy essays, conference news, and directives, which were unpopular with the masses. After the Zhejiang Provincial County Newspaper Work Conference in June 1955, the editorial department gradually established the idea of relying on the masses to run the newspaper, actively developing farmer correspondents. The number of articles and letters from the masses also continued to increase, reaching more than 600 pieces per month by January of this year. Many articles from farmer correspondents reflected issues that were fresh and important, and the criticisms they put forward were sincere and sharp, and the language was pure and vivid. As a result of publishing a large number of letters and articles from the masses, the newspaper increased the voice of the masses and the atmosphere of life, better reflecting the various issues that the masses were concerned about. In this way, the newspaper went from being unpopular with farmers to being loved by everyone.

The main task of mass work in county newspapers is to absorb and cultivate activists from among the farmers and to organize a contingent of correspondents, mainly composed of farmer correspondents. The so-called activists not only refer to those who actively write articles and letters to the newspaper, but also to those who play an active role in production and work. Only such activists are the political force that county newspapers should rely on. How to develop correspondents? According to the experience of some county newspapers, it is best to inspect and select from among those who frequently submit articles and letters. It can also be recommended by grassroots Party organizations and active correspondents, or through various activist and grassroots cadre meetings held in the county. The experience of "Daye Construction" in Hubei and other county newspapers has also proven that, where conditions permit, organizing correspondents together, for example, forming correspondent groups based on townships, work units, or agricultural producers' cooperatives, has many benefits for giving play to the role of correspondents: it is possible to collectively study reporting plans and written articles, improve the quality of reporting, and ensure the authenticity of articles; it can also attract more activists to participate in newspaper work, while facilitating the newspaper to strengthen its ties with correspondents. With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the number of grassroots newspapers in rural areas has increased, and this is also a force that county newspapers should pay attention to using. County newspapers should establish close ties with township or village wall newspapers, blackboards, and agricultural producers' cooperative newspapers, develop them into collective correspondents, and unite and educate the vast number of farmer correspondents through them.

Handling articles and letters from correspondents and readers in a conscientious and responsible manner is one of the most effective ways to strengthen the ties between newspapers and correspondents and readers, and to cultivate and educate correspondents. In handling articles and letters from the masses, the "Daye Construction" newspaper has done the following: It adopts as many articles as possible that can be adopted; it puts forward specific opinions for those that need to be supplemented or rewritten, and asks the author to modify and supplement them; for those that cannot be adopted for various reasons, it also promptly replies individually or comprehensively, explaining the reasons and giving the author encouragement. The "Xiaoshan Newspaper" has also established a system for carefully handling articles and letters, and provided enthusiastic assistance to farmer correspondents. These practices have achieved very good results. In order to strengthen ties with correspondents, many county newspapers have also implemented a system of rotating editorial staff to go to the countryside. In this way, the editorial staff can systematically convene correspondent meetings in various townships and agricultural producers' cooperatives, or find correspondents for individual conversations, specifically helping them solve difficulties in writing or learning, and establishing friendships with correspondents. Not only that, this method can also combine the editorial department's understanding of actual work situations, investigating the opinions of the masses on the newspaper, testing the effectiveness of propaganda, arranging reporting tasks, and the work of educating and training correspondents. In addition, some county newspapers hold small training classes to train key correspondents, or regularly convene correspondent conferences to summarize and exchange experiences in correspondence work, and elect outstanding correspondents; some county newspapers regularly send reporting tips and business publications to correspondents to help and guide them; some county newspapers also adopt methods such as key correspondents contracting mutual assistance or "pen-mouth mutual assistance" to cultivate more correspondents. These practices are all effective in consolidating and expanding the contingent of correspondents.

There can be many ways for county newspapers to carry out mass work. The problem lies in the fact that the editorial department must correct its understanding of mass work and persist in carrying out arduous and meticulous work.

    办县报要做好农民通讯员的工作
    刘凯
    县报的主要对象是农民。广泛地吸收农民群众参加县报工作，本来应该是很自然的事。可是，目前有的县报却不是这样做的。为什么呢？有人说：“县报版面小，刊期长，每期用不了多少稿件，不加强群众工作也能出版。”有人说：“编辑部干部少，才需要依靠群众办报；干部多了，就可以少依靠群众，甚至不依靠他们。”也有人认为：“报纸工作是文字工作，农民不认字，不能依靠”，“依靠农民通讯员是远水救不了近火”。这种种错误认识妨碍了县报群众工作的开展，影响了报纸质量的提高。浙江“萧山报”走过的一段弯路，有力地说明了这一点。
    “萧山报”刚刚创办的时期，编辑部很不重视群众工作，对主动来稿来信的积极分子很少联系，对农民群众更是瞧不起，报纸创刊四个月连一个通讯员也没发展。编报的四个工作人员虽然很忙，有时一个人一天要骑自行车跑到几个乡去采访，可是报纸却办得不好——版面上经常塞满了长篇大论、会议新闻和指示公告，不受群众欢迎。1955年六月浙江省召开县报工作会议以后，编辑部才逐步树立了依靠群众办报的思想，积极地发展农民通讯员，群众的来稿来信也不断增加起来，到今年一月份已经达到每月六百多件。许多农民通讯员的来稿反映的问题新鲜、重要，提出的批评诚恳、尖锐，语言也纯朴生动。大量刊用群众来信来稿的结果，使报纸增加了群众的声音和生活的气息，更好地反映了群众所关心的各种问题，这样，报纸就由不受农民欢迎变成大家爱看的了。
    县报群众工作主要的就是吸收和培养农民群众中的积极分子，组织以农民通讯员为主的通讯员队伍。所谓积极分子，不光是指积极向报社写稿写信的人，而且是指在生产和工作中起积极作用的人。只有这样的积极分子，才是县报所应当依靠的政治力量。怎样发展通讯员呢？根据一些县报的经验，最好是从经常来稿来信的人当中考察、挑选，也可以由基层党组织和积极通讯员推荐，或利用县里召开各种积极分子和基层干部会议的机会，物色挑选。湖北“大冶建设”和其他一些县报的经验还证明了，在有条件的地方把通讯员组织起来，例如以乡、以工作单位或农业生产合作社为单位组成通讯小组，对于发挥通讯员的作用有很多好处：可以集体地研究报道计划和写成的稿件，提高报道质量，保证稿件的真实性；也可以吸引更多的积极分子参加报纸工作，同时便于报社加强同通讯员的联系。随着农业合作化运动的发展，农村的基层报纸多起来了，这也是县报要注意运用的一支力量。县报应当同乡或村里的墙报、黑板报、农业生产合作社的社报，建立起密切的联系，发展他们为集体通讯员，并且通过他们来团结和教育广大的农民通讯员。
    认真负责地处理通讯员和读者的来稿来信，是密切报纸同通讯员、读者的联系和培养教育通讯员的最有效的方法之一。“大冶建设”报在处理群众来稿来信的工作中做到了：能够采用的，尽量采用；需要补充或改写的，提出具体意见，请作者修改补充；因种种原因不能采用的，也及时地个别回信或综合回信，说明原因，并给作者以鼓励。“萧山报”也建立了认真处理来稿来信的制度，并对农民通讯员进行热情的帮助。这种做法都获得了很好的效果。为了加强同通讯员的联系，许多县报还实行了编辑人员轮流下乡的制度。这样，编辑人员可以有计划地到各乡、农业生产合作社召开通讯员会议，或者找通讯员个别交谈，具体地帮助他们解决写作或学习上的困难，和通讯员建立友谊。不仅如此，这种方法还能把编辑部了解实际工作情况、调查群众对报纸的意见、检验宣传效果、布置报道任务等各项工作和教育培养通讯员的工作结合起来。另外，有些县报举办小型训练班，训练通讯员骨干，或者定期地召开通讯员大会，总结和交流通讯工作的经验，评选优秀的通讯员；有些县报经常发给通讯员报道提示、业务刊物，对他们进行帮助和指导；也有一些县报采取骨干通讯员包干互助或“笔嘴互助”等办法来培养更多的通讯员，这些做法对于巩固和扩大通讯员的队伍，都是行之有效的。
    县报开展群众工作的方法可以是多种多样的。问题就在编辑部必须端正对群众工作的认识，坚持进行艰苦和细致的工作。
