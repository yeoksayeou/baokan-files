    The Era of Using Force to Promote Diplomacy is Over
    Politicians and Newspapers in Various Countries Oppose Western Threats Against Egypt
     India
    The Indian "Tribune" said: "Threats of force and economic sanctions will only make matters worse. Britain must clearly recognize that the era of Palmerstonian (a British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister in the mid-19th century, known for using force to promote diplomatic policies) diplomacy is over."
    Indonesia
    The "Indonesia Times" stated that the nationalization of the Suez Canal was completely legal. Neither the Security Council nor the International Court of Justice is qualified to hear this purely internal affair. The newspaper pointed out that it would be unreasonable for Britain to seize the canal by force.
    Pakistan
    A resolution passed by the Awami League's meeting of party workers in Lahore on July 31 condemned the West's threats against Egypt.
    Qasimi, the secretary of the Karachi organization of the People's Alliance, issued a statement to the press on July 31, saying that the Pakistani government should make it clear to Western countries that Pakistan will never tolerate any aggressive actions against the Egyptian people.
    The Karachi Working Committee of the Muslim League passed a resolution at a meeting celebrating Egypt's actions on July 31, stating that if Egypt is subjected to aggression, the Pakistani people will resolutely support Egypt.
    Nepal
    The Nepalese "Samaj" published an editorial on August 1, stating that Nepal wholeheartedly supports Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The editorial reminded Western countries that "the era of strong countries ruling weak countries is over."
    Uruguay
    The Uruguayan "El Debate" pointed out that the clamor of Western countries to take economic and military pressure and threats against Egypt pales in comparison to the growing momentum of thirty Asian and African countries supporting Egypt. The newspaper said that the biggest mistake Western countries could make is to think they can stop the inevitable development of events.
    Italy
    An article published in the Roman "Paese Sera" on July 30 stated that Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal helps to establish equal and decent relations in the Mediterranean, thereby turning the Mediterranean into a calm sea in the future.
    The article pointed out that the measures taken by Egypt do not threaten Italy's interests in the slightest.
    Sweden
    The Swedish "Norrskensflamman" believes that the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company is a continuation of its struggle to end the exploitation and oppression of Egypt.

专栏：

    用武力推行外交的时代过去了
    各国政界和报纸反对西方威胁埃及
     印度
    印度“论坛报”说：“使用武力的威胁和经济制裁的手段，只会使事情恶化。英国必须清楚地认识：巴麦尊（十九世纪中叶英国外交大臣和首相，以使用武力推行外交政策著称）外交的时代已经过去了。”
    印度尼西亚
    “印度尼西亚时报”说，苏彝士运河的国有化是完全合法的。不论是安全理事会或是国际法院，都没有资格受理这个纯粹是内政的问题。报纸指出，英国若以武力夺取运河，也是没有道理的。巴基斯坦
    自由巴基斯坦党七月三十一日在拉合尔召开的党工作者会议的一项决议中，谴责西方对埃及进行的威胁。
    人民联盟喀喇蚩组织书记卡希米里七月三十一日向报界发表声明说：巴基斯坦政府应当向西方国家表明，巴基斯坦决不会容忍对埃及人民采取的任何侵略行动。
    穆斯林联盟喀喇蚩工作委员会七月三十一日在庆祝埃及的行动的会议上通过了一项决议说：一旦埃及遭受侵略，巴基斯坦人民将坚决支持埃及。
    尼泊尔
    尼泊尔“社会报”在八月一日发表社论说，尼泊尔衷心支持埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有。社论提醒西方国家说：“强国统治弱国的时代已经过去了”。
    乌拉圭
    乌拉圭“辩论报”指出，西方国家要对埃及采取经济和军事压力和威胁的叫嚣，同三十个亚非国家支持埃及的壮大的声势相比，就不足为道了。报纸说，西方国家可能犯的最大的错误，就是以为它们能够制止事件的必不可避免的发展。
    意大利
    罗马“国家晚报”七月三十日刊载的一篇文章说，埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定有助于在地中海建立平等和合乎体统的关系，从而在将来把地中海变成一个平静的海。
    这篇文章指出，埃及所采取的措施丝毫不威胁意大利的利益。
    瑞典
    瑞典“北极火焰报”认为埃及政府将苏彝士运河公司国有化的决定是它争取结束对埃及的剥削和压迫的斗争的继续。　（据新华社讯）
