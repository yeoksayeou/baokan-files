Xinhua News Agency, London, August 25th: Following the conclusion of the London Conference, Britain, France, and the United States are progressively unfolding activities to coerce Egypt into accepting the Dulles Plan.

The so-called "Five-Nation Suez Canal Committee," composed of Australia, Ethiopia, Iran, Sweden, and the United States, held its first meeting on August 24th. The meeting passed a note to the Egyptian government, requesting Egyptian President Nasser to agree to hold negotiations with the Five-Nation Committee based on the Dulles Plan for international management of the Suez Canal. The Chairman of the Five-Nation Committee, Australian Prime Minister Menzies, delivered the note to the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Fayez, on the evening of the same day.

The United Press International reported that Menzies advocated taking a firm attitude in dealing with Egypt. The Indian Press Trust pointed out that in the Five-Nation Committee, the U.S. representative, Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, is the most influential member. Although Menzies is the chairman, the U.S. opinion will be the main one.

The chief architect of the Five-Nation Committee, Dulles, already left London on August 24th to return to the United States. On the same day, French Foreign Minister Pineau also returned to France from London. At the Paris airport, when reporters asked him whether force would be used against Egypt if Egypt rejected the invitation of the Five-Nation Committee, he replied: "Certainly, more negotiations will be held, and the question of using force has not yet arisen." However, Pineau added that if Egypt gives a negative answer, "we will consult together on what further actions to take."

Currently, Britain and France continue to mobilize troops to intimidate Egypt. Most of the personnel of the British Third Infantry Division will sail from Southampton to the British base of Malta in the Mediterranean. Seven merchant ships have already been requisitioned to transport the division's equipment. In addition, it is said that French Air Force aircraft, including jet fighter-bombers, have been concentrated at airports near Paris, ready to be transferred to the Middle East at any time.

    “五国委员会”要埃及就杜勒斯计划进行谈判
    英法继续调动军队威吓埃及
    据新华社伦敦25日电　伦敦会议结束以后，英、法、美三国为胁迫埃及接受杜勒斯计划的活动正在步步展开。
    由澳大利亚、埃塞俄比亚、伊朗、瑞典和美国组成的所谓“五国苏彝士运河委员会”在8月24日举行了第一次会议，会议通过一项致埃及政府的照会，要求埃及总统纳赛尔同意以国际管理苏彝士运河的杜勒斯计划为基础，同五国委员会举行谈判。五国委员会主席、澳大利亚总理孟席斯在当天晚上把这个照会交给了埃及驻英国大使费陶。
    合众社消息说，孟席斯主张采取坚定态度来同埃及接触。印度报业托辣斯消息指出，在五国委员会中，美国代表、助理国务卿汉德逊是最有影响的委员。虽然孟席斯是主席，而美国的意见将是主要的。
    五国委员会的主要策划人杜勒斯已经在8月24日离开伦敦回美国。同一天，法国外交部长比诺也从伦敦回到法国。在巴黎机场上记者们问他：如果埃及拒绝五国委员会邀请是否要对埃及使用武力？他回答说：“可以肯定，将要举行更多的谈判，而使用武力的问题还没有发生。”不过，比诺又说，如果埃及作否定的答复，“我们就将一道磋商采取什么进一步的行动”。
    目前，英国和法国继续调动军队来对埃及进行恫吓。英国第三步兵师大部分人员将从南安普敦乘船开往地中海的英国基地马耳他岛。有七艘商船已经被征用来运输这个师的装备。此外，据说已有包括喷气战斗轰炸机的法国空军飞机，已经在巴黎附近机场集中，准备随时调往中东。
