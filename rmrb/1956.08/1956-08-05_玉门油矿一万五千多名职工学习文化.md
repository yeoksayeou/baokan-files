Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, August 3rd: To date, more than 15,000 workers at the Yumen Oilfield have participated in various cultural studies.

    The one hundred and ninety-two workers who recently graduated from the literacy classes at the spare-time cultural school all achieved good results. They have already learned more than 2,000 characters, can write short essays of two to three hundred characters, and their arithmetic has reached the level of elementary school graduates. Workers in many units such as drilling, refining, and machinery, after cultural studies, are able to take simple notes and can also record what the master craftsmen teach about technology. Hu Zixiang, a fitter at the machinery factory, was deeply moved after learning about Zhang Mingshan's creation of the anti-encirclement plate and was determined to improve his skills after returning to the factory. As a result, he transformed the manual tools for making stills into semi-automatic ones, increasing production efficiency and saving the country more than 5,000 yuan in wealth.

    Currently, the Yumen Oilfield is building seventy-four new classrooms to accommodate more students.

    玉门油矿一万五千多名职工学习文化
    据新华社玉门3日电　玉门油矿到目前为止，已有一万五千多名职工，参加各种文化学习。
    不久以前在业余文化学校脱产识字班毕业的一百九十二名工人，学习成绩都很好。他们已经认识两千多字，能写二、三百字的短文，算术也达到初小毕业的水平。钻井、炼油、机械等许多单位的工人，经过文化学习以后，都能够记简单笔记，老师傅教技术的时候也能记下来。机械厂钳工胡子祥，学了张明山创造反围盘一课，很受感动，回厂以后下决心也要改进技术。结果他把做蒸馏子的手工工具改成了半自动化，提高了生产效率，为国家节省了五千多元的财富。
    现在，玉门油矿正在新建七十四个教室，以便容纳更多的学员。
