Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 16th: Over ten thousand agricultural production cooperatives in Liaoning Province have completed the trial calculation and distribution of income. Over 90% of the cooperatives can achieve increased income for over 90% of their members.

During the trial calculation and distribution work, various localities universally promoted the policy of "less deduction and more distribution" to strive for income increases for over 90% of cooperative members to cooperative cadres and members. Based on the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, they comprehensively checked and revised the cooperative's production and income-expenditure plans, correcting the phenomena of excessively high, excessively low, or one-sided original production plans, and promoted the development of diversified operations. In Heishan, Zhangwu, Jinxi, and Lingyuan counties, over a thousand agricultural cooperatives increased their sideline income by more than 1.5 million yuan in less than two months after implementing the publicity and education campaign to strive for overall production increase and income increases for over 90% of cooperative members, more than doubling the original plan. During the trial calculation and distribution, agricultural cooperatives in various localities re-examined their financial plans, conducted a serious rectification of financial and accounting work, reduced non-productive expenditures, and corrected the excessive number of full-time cadres and inappropriate cadre subsidies. The production costs of general cooperatives were reduced by 10% to 20% compared to the original plan. After the financial work was rectified, it generally achieved "three clearances, two checks, and one announcement" (clearing financial accounts, clearing labor work accounts, clearing inventory materials; checking diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, checking the implementation of financial and accounting systems; announcing to the members' congress after the investigation was completed), improved the financial and accounting system, and overcame the long-standing chaotic phenomena.

During the trial calculation and distribution, agricultural cooperatives in various localities also universally checked and adjusted the phenomenon of wide disparities in labor income between production teams within a cooperative and between members, which is an important link in ensuring universal income increases for members. In addition, unreasonable labor quotas and labor remuneration were also revised, and appropriate arrangements were made for the production of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households, and members who may have reduced income.

The trial calculation and distribution greatly enhanced the atmosphere of democratic cooperative management. In the trial calculation and distribution work of the Xianfeng Cooperative in Xiaotun Township, Liaoyang County, members put forward sixty reasonable suggestions for improving leadership, which led to a change in the undemocratic leadership style and the cadres who did not like to participate in production in the past, further strengthening the relationship between the cooperative cadres and the members. The trial calculation and distribution made the collective interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the members more closely integrated, thereby greatly enhancing the collectivist ideology and labor enthusiasm of the members. After the trial calculation and distribution of the Fuqiang Cooperative in Gaiping County, members who did not participate in labor in the past also participated in labor, and the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative immediately increased from 90% to 95%. The 24th Production Team of the Hongsheng Cooperative in Xinjin County lacked 1,500 piles of topdressing fertilizer. After the 26th and 27th teams learned about it, they immediately took the initiative to support them with 470 piles of manure, saying, "It's no guarantee that the distribution plan will be fulfilled if only our team does well and other teams don't do well."

Currently, in order to ensure the realization of the income increase distribution plan, agricultural cooperatives in various localities are widely carrying out production increase and income guarantee campaigns, continuing to strengthen field management, vigorously preventing floods and waterlogging, accumulating fertilizer and composting manure, and developing sideline production, turning the traditionally idle period between harvests into a busy farming season.

    辽宁省万余农业社完成试算试分
    90％的社90％以上的社员可以增加收入
    新华社沈阳16日电　辽宁省一万多个农业生产合作社已完成了收益分配的试算试分，90％的社可以达到90％以上的社员增加收入。
    各地在进行试算试分工作中，普遍向合作社干部和社员深入地宣传了“少扣多分”争取90％以上社员增加收入的政策，根据勤俭办社的方针，全面地检查和修正了合作社的生产收支计划，对原定生产计划偏高偏低和单一片面的现象都进行了纠正，推动了多种经营的开展。黑山、彰武、锦西、凌源四县一千多个农业社，自从贯彻争取全面增产和90％以上社员增加收入的宣传教育以后，不到两个月，副业收入就增加了一百五十多万元，比原订计划增加一倍。各地农业社在试算试分中，重新审查了财务计划，对财会工作进行了一次认真的整顿，减少了非生产性开支，对脱产干部过多和干部补贴不当的作了纠正，一般社的生产成本都比原定计划降低了10％到20％。财务工作经过整顿后，一般都作到了“三清二查一公布”（清理财务帐、清理劳动工帐、清理库存物资，查勤俭办社、查财务会计制度执行情况，清查完了向社员大会公布），健全了财会制度，克服了长期存在的混乱现象。
    在试算试分中，各地农业社还普遍检查和调整了一社之内各生产队之间与社员之间劳动收入相差悬殊的现象，这是保证社员普遍增加收入的重要一环。此外，对于劳动定额和劳动报酬不合理的也进行了修正，对烈军属、老弱孤寡户和可能减少收入的社员生产也做了适当安排。
    通过试算试分大大提高了合作社民主办社的空气。辽阳县小屯乡先锋社在试算试分工作中，社员提出了六十条改进领导的合理化建议，使过去领导作风不民主和不爱参加生产的干部开始有了转变，进一步密切了社干部和社员的关系。试算试分使合作社的集体利益和社员个人利益更加密切地结合起来，从而大大提高了社员的集体主义思想和劳动积极性。盖平县富强社试算试分后，过去不参加劳动的社员也参加劳动了，全社的劳动出勤率立即由90％提高到95％。新金县红升社第二十四生产队缺追肥一千五百堆，第二十六、二十七两队知道后，立即主动支援给他们四百七十堆粪肥，他们说：“光我们队搞好了，别的队搞不好，分配规划还是没保证。”
    现在，各地农业社为了保证实现增加收入的分配规划，正在广泛开展增产保收运动，继续加强田间管理，大力防汛防涝，积肥沤粪，开展副业生产，把历年挂锄期间的农闲变成了农忙。
