Which Pig Raising Method is Better?

Zhao Xue Tian Xin'en

Of the more than 100 million farm households across the country, excluding some ethnic minority areas, most have a habit of raising pigs and have certain pig raising equipment. However, after agricultural cooperativization, which method should be adopted for pig raising? How can pig raising be further developed? This is an important issue that needs to be studied and resolved.

After cooperativization, a series of new problems have emerged in pig raising production, and these problems are concentrated in the relationship between the cooperative and its members. In the past, farmers raised pigs privately mainly to solve the problem of fertilizer for their own fields. As the saying goes, "Raising pigs doesn't make money, but look back at the fields." They didn't do detailed accounting of pig raising costs and pig selling income. After joining the cooperative, the land was used uniformly by the cooperative, and the fertilizer was also uniformly resolved by the cooperative. There was no need to worry about it anymore. Therefore, farmers raise pigs no longer for fertilizer, but to increase their sideline income. If raising pigs is unprofitable or even loses money, farmers will not want to raise pigs. Obviously, if the cooperative wants to develop pig raising and increase fertilizer sources, the first thing to do is to solve the relationship between the public and the private. That is to say, pig farmers must be profitable in order to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs from an economic point of view. At the same time, the cooperative must not suffer losses. What kind of method should be adopted to adapt to the current actual situation? Based on our understanding of the situation and problems in Zhejiang Province, we put forward some immature opinions for relevant parties to refer to.

Most of the members have rich pig raising experience, existing pig house equipment, and the convenience of using leftover food and swill from each household and collecting wild feed. In some cooperatives, many members are unwilling to raise pigs due to reasons such as the low valuation of pig manure, insufficient feed supply, and too little time for members to allocate themselves. In the future, as long as we follow the "Instructions on Developing Pig Raising" issued by the State Council on July 1st, pay attention to improving the unreasonable phenomena in the current fertilizer valuation; uniformly arrange the production and distribution of feed for the entire society; leave time for members to engage in private labor; and help members solve the problems of purchasing piglets and preventing and treating pig diseases, the number of pigs raised by members can be rapidly increased.

However, from the perspective of future development, in addition to promoting private pig raising, we must also actively develop the collective pig raising industry of cooperatives. Collective pig raising is not common in Zhejiang Province. From the perspective of collective breeding in a few agricultural cooperatives, its superiority has been demonstrated. The members of the Hongqi Cooperative in Hangxian County said, "Collective pig raising has three advantages: saving labor, saving capital, and saving feed." Collective pig raising can not only save manpower and feed, but also facilitate the adoption of new technologies and the implementation of planned production.

Collective breeding still has many difficulties in practice under the current circumstances. The main reasons are that cooperatives do not yet have large-scale pig raising experience and equipment, and the conditions of funds and technology are also insufficient. Therefore, under the current circumstances, how to create conditions and accumulate experience is an important issue related to the large-scale development of hog production in the future.

According to our understanding, the "public ownership with distributed raising" currently adopted in Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, is a better way to gradually transition to collective breeding. The specific method is that the cooperative collectively raises a certain number of sows and boars, and distributes all the piglets born from the sows to the members for foster care. This method is more suitable for cooperatives that have not been established for a long time, lack collective pig raising experience, and lack funds. This can not only develop public pig raising, but also make use of the favorable conditions of members' family pig raising equipment, pig raising experience and auxiliary labor. When adopting this method, the problems to be solved are mainly the remuneration for members' foster care, the source of feed and the disposal of fertilizer. Because of the change in the form of pig ownership, these problems are easier to handle than in the case of private ownership. Currently, the more common method adopted in Zhejiang Province is the "six fixings" method:

1.  Fixed time. It is stipulated that after the weaned piglets are handed over to the members for foster care, they should be raised into fat pigs within 250 days.

2.  Fixed weight. Within a certain period of time, the pigs should increase to a certain weight.

3.  Fixed feed. The cooperative provides feed costs, and the members are responsible for collecting or purchasing feed. For every pound of weight gained, the cooperative pays 15 cents for feed. If there is difficulty in obtaining refined feed, the cooperative will assist in solving it.

4.  Fixed work points. It is stipulated that for every pound of pig weight gained, 1.5 work points are earned, which will be distributed together with other agricultural labor after the autumn harvest.

5.  Fixed fertilizer. During the period of raising pigs for the cooperative, each pig must hand in 32 to 33 loads of pure manure.

6.  Fixed rewards and punishments. If the fat pigs can be raised beyond the specified weight within the specified time, the excess part will be awarded to the foster care household; if the standard weight is not reached, the foster care household should pay for the feed and labor themselves and continue to raise them to the specified weight.

In addition, if the pigs die due to epidemics, it should be decided whether to compensate and how much to compensate according to the foster care household's daily sanitation work and the contagiousness of the epidemic.

Implementing this method, the cooperative's investment in pig raising is much less than if all the agricultural cooperatives were to raise them collectively. Members who have pig raising equipment and labor but lack money to buy piglets can also obtain considerable income from pig raising. At the same time, it also eliminates the phenomenon of members only caring about earning agricultural labor work points and not caring about finding wild feed. After the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Dongyang County implemented this method, the number of pigs in the entire cooperative has doubled in the first half of this year, and the number of collectively raised breeding sows has increased from ten to thirty-seven. Four members saw that public ownership with distributed raising was good and voluntarily bought back piglets as an investment in the cooperative's production.

Some areas also use "four fixings", the content of which is roughly the same as "six fixings".

From the problems existing in several breeding methods, private breeding has more problems, but it currently accounts for a large proportion and is the main method for developing pig raising at present. Therefore, attention should be paid to solving the problems in private breeding and stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for pig raising. Although collective public breeding has many advantages, the current conditions and experience are insufficient, and it is not suitable for universal implementation. Developing hog production should not only pay attention to the current actual possibilities, but also consider the future development prospects. Therefore, actively promoting the "public ownership with distributed raising" method in order to gradually transition to collective breeding seems to be more appropriate at present.

    哪种养猪方式好？
    赵雪　田信恩
    全国一亿多农户，除部分少数民族地区外，一般农户都有养猪的习惯，也有一定的养猪设备。但是在农业合作化以后，究竟采用哪种办法来养猪？怎样才能更有利于养猪事业的发展？这是目前需要研究解决的重要问题。
    合作化以后，在养猪生产方面出现了一系列新的问题，这些问题集中表现在合作社和社员的关系上。过去农民私人养猪主要是为了解决自己田里的肥料，所谓“养猪不赚钱，回头看看田”，他们对养猪成本和卖猪收入，是不去算细账的。入社以后，土地归社统一使用了，肥料也是由社统一解决，用不着自己为它多操心了，因此农民养猪，已经不再是为了肥料，而是为了增加自己的副业收入。如果养猪无利甚至亏本，农民就不愿养猪。很显然的，合作社要发展养猪事业，增加肥源，首先就要解决公私之间的关系。也就是说，要使养猪户有利可图，从经济利益上刺激农民的养猪积极性。同时，合作社也要不吃亏。究竟采取什么样的方式才能适应当前的实际情况呢？根据我们在浙江省了解到的情况和问题，提出几点不成熟的意见，供有关方面参考。
    社员大都有丰富的养猪经验，有现成的猪舍设备，有利用各家各户剩饭泔水和采集野生饲料的便利条件。有些合作社里，由于猪粪折价太低，饲料供应不足，给社员自己支配的时间太少等原因，使很多社员不愿意养猪。今后只要按国务院七月一日发布的“关于发展养猪的指示”去作，注意改进目前肥料折价中的不合理现象；统一安排全社的饲料生产和分配；给社员留出从事私人劳动的时间；帮助社员解决仔猪的采购和猪病的防治等问题，社员养猪数量是能迅速增加的。
    但是，从今后的发展来看，除了提倡私人养猪之外，同时也要积极发展合作社的集体养猪业。集体养猪在浙江地区还不多，从少数农业社集体饲养的情况来看，已经显示出它的优越性。杭县红旗社的社员们说“集体养猪有三好：省工、省本、省饲料。”集体养猪不仅能节省人力、节省饲料，还便于采用新技术，实行计划生产。
    集体饲养在目前情况下，实行起来还有不少困难。主要是合作社还没有大规模养猪的经验和设备，资金、技术等条件也不足。因此，在目前情况下，如何创造条件、积累经验，是关系到今后大量发展毛猪生产的重要问题。
    根据我们了解，浙江省金华专区等地目前采取的“公有分养”，是逐渐过渡到集体饲养的比较好的方式。具体作法是由合作社集体饲养一定数量的母猪和公猪，将母猪所生的全部小猪分散给社员代养。这个方式对于建社不久、集体养猪经验不足、资金也缺乏的社来说，是比较合宜的。这样既能发展公共养猪业，同时也把社员家庭的养猪设备、养猪经验和辅助劳力等有利条件，都运用起来了。采用这种方式，要解决的问题主要是社员代养的报酬、饲料来源和肥料处理等。这些问题由于猪的占有形式的改变，比起私有的时候也容易处理些。目前浙江省比较普遍采用的是“六定”办法：
    一、定时间。规定将断奶小猪交给社员代养后，在二百五十天内养成肥猪。
    二、定重量。在一定的时间内，应该使猪增加到一定的体重。
    三、定饲料。由合作社给饲料费，社员负责采集或购买饲料。每增加一斤体重，社里给饲料费一角五分，如果精饲料来源有困难，由社协助解决。
    四、定工分。规定每增加一斤猪体重，得1.5个劳动工分，秋收后和其他农业劳动一起参加分配。
    五、定肥料。在代社养猪的期间，每只猪要交出净粪32到33担。
    六、定奖惩。凡在规定时间里能把肥猪养得超过规定的重量的，超过部分全部奖给代养户；如果达不到标准重量，代养户应自己付出饲料和劳动，继续饲养到规定的重量。
    另外，猪只倘若发生疫病死亡，要按代养户平日清洁卫生工作情况和疫病的传染性，决定是否赔偿以及赔偿多少。
    实行这个办法，合作社用于养猪的投资比全部由农业社集体饲养要节省得多，有养猪设备和劳力而缺钱买小猪的社员，也可以从养猪中得到相当的收入。同时也消除了社员只顾挣农业劳动工分、不顾找野生饲料的现象。东阳县光明农业社实行这个办法以后，今年上半年全社的猪数增加一倍左右，集体公养的种母猪从十只增加到三十七只。有四户社员看到公有分养好，自动买回了小猪，作为对社的生产投资。
    也有的地区采用“四定”，其内容大致和“六定”相同。
    从几种饲养方式所存在的问题看来，私养的问题较多，但目前占的比重较大，是当前发展养猪的主要办法。因此要注意解决私养中的问题，激发农民养猪的积极性。集体公养虽有许多优越性，但目前的条件和经验不足，尚不宜普遍实行。发展毛猪生产既要注意当前的实际可能，也要考虑到将来的发展前途，因此积极推行“公有分养”办法，以便逐渐过渡到集体饲养，在目前看来是较适当的。（附图片）
