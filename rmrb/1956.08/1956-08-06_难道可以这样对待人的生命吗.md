Can Human Life Be Treated This Way?

We are college students from the Central China Institute of Technology interning at the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site. In the nearly one month we've been here, we have personally witnessed six or seven accidents involving personal injury or death. In early July, there were three serious injury accidents in less than two days. One worker was hit in the head by a template thrown from above the factory building and lost consciousness; another worker fell down the stairs because the ladder was too slippery and had no handrail, hitting the messy steel bars below, which pierced several holes in his head, and he also lost consciousness; at the Shangdong factory building, an electrician using an electric shovel was electrocuted and fell from a height of three meters, also hitting his head and losing consciousness. On July 16, at the electromechanical installation site, a worker died from electrocution due to delayed rescue. These are just the accidents we have seen recently. Accidents have been constant here in the past; as for minor accidents, there are even more. Being stabbed in the foot by "skyward nails" happens several times almost every day.

Such frequent accidents, such a large number of worker injuries and deaths, make us feel very sad; however, all of this has not aroused the serious attention of the Engineering Bureau. The construction units here do not cooperate with each other, but are afraid of being taken advantage of. It is said that the reason why "skyward nails" are not properly cleaned up is because each unit is unwilling to spend manpower, so even if people are stabbed every day, they don't care. In fact, how much manpower would it take to clean up the "skyward nails"? Educating workers not to throw nails around can solve the problem without spending manpower.

Even those relatively large injury and death accidents are not unavoidable. Here, such an attitude is adopted towards safety work: only after someone falls to their death somewhere is a railing installed; only after someone is electrocuted somewhere is the electrical equipment checked, resulting in endless accidents, and labor protection conditions have never been thoroughly improved, and similar accidents continue to occur. If you come to visit the construction site, you can find that most ladders do not have railings, some are already loose or have several rungs broken in the middle, and you have to be careful when going up and down; people working above often throw templates and concrete stones down below; the construction site is full of "skyward nails", and the enamel coating of the wires is damaged, and the copper wires are exposed. With a little carelessness, there is a risk of electric shock.

The safety facilities here are poor, and the medical work is also very poorly done. There is no medical station or medical personnel on site; the worker who was electrocuted on July 16, more than an hour after the electrocution, the medical personnel had not yet arrived at the scene. By the time they brought oxygen, the worker had already died. As for calling an ambulance, it is even more difficult.

In addition, safety education for workers is extremely inadequate. Many workers do not wear safety helmets or rubber shoes. The seventh-grade technician who died of electric shock on the 16th was wearing a pair of cloth-soled shoes.

We want to question the person in charge of the Shizitan project. Can human life be treated so irresponsibly? Is it more troublesome to install protective railings before someone falls to their death than to install railings after someone falls to their death? Isn't it the responsibility of the leadership to care for workers and provide safety education?

### 难道可以这样对待人的生命吗

    难道可以这样对待人的生命吗
    我们是华中工学院来狮子滩水电站工地实习的大学生，到这里近一个月的时间，就亲眼看见六、七起人身伤亡事故。七月上旬，在相隔不到两天内，接连出现了三次重伤事故。一个工人被厂房上边扔下来的模板打中头部昏过去了；一个工人在下楼梯时因梯子太滑又没栏杆，跌了下去，碰中下边乱七八糟的钢筋，把头部扎了几个洞，也昏过去了；上峒厂房一个电焊工用电铲时触电，从三公尺高的地方摔了下来，也打伤了头昏过去了。七月十六日，在机电安装工地上，有一个工人在触电后因救护过迟而死去。这仅是最近我们见到的几件事故。以往这里的事故也是不断的；至于小的事故那就更多了。被“朝天钉”扎伤了脚，差不多每天都有好几起。
    这样频繁的事故，这样多工人的伤亡，使我们感到非常悲痛；然而，所有这一切并没有引起工程局的严重注意。这里的施工单位不是互相配合，而是唯恐自己吃亏。像“朝天钉”不好好收拾，据说就是各单位都不愿意花人工的缘故，因而即使天天扎伤人也不去管它。其实收拾收拾“朝天钉”花得了几个人工呢？教育工人不要把钉子乱扔，不花人工也能解决这个问题。
    即使是那些比较大的伤亡事故，也不是不可避免的。这里，对待安全工作采取这样一种态度：哪里跌死了人，才在哪里安上栏杆；哪里电死了人，才在哪里检查一下电器设备，因而事故层出不穷，劳动保护条件始终没有彻底改善，同类事故还是不断发生。如果你到工地来参观，就可以发现大多数梯子都没有栏杆，有的已经松了或中间断去了几级，上上下下都得提心吊胆；在上头工作的人，时常向下边扔模板、混凝土石块；工地遍地都是“朝天钉”，电线漆包皮坏了，铜丝裸露在外边，只要稍稍大意，就有触电的危险。
    这里的安全设施既差，医疗工作也作得极不好，现场上没有医药站，也没有医务人员；七月十六日触电的工人，在触电后一小时多，医务人员还没到现场，等他带来氧气，工人已经死了。至于叫救护车那就更困难了。
    此外，对工人的安全教育也是极不够的。很多工人不戴安全帽，不穿胶鞋，十六日触电身死的一个七级技工就是穿了一双布底鞋。
    我们要责问狮子滩工程负责人。难道可以这样不负责任地对待人的生命吗？难道先作好防护栏杆比跌死人以后再作栏杆要多费事吗？难道爱护工人、进行安全教育，这不是领导的责任吗？
