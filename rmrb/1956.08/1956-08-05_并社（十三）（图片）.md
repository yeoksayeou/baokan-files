    Merger of Cooperatives (13)
    Adapted by Tu Honghen, Illustrated by Jiang Ying
    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    49  Li Baichuan returned home, annoyed, but no one was there. He wanted to smoke, but couldn't find his tobacco pouch. Suddenly, he caught sight of Yinghua's small cape and pulled it over, reaching into the pocket for cigarette paper.
    50  Instead, he pulled out a letter folded into a triangle. He opened it and saw a line of small words at the top: "My dear Flower Sister!" It went on to say to pay attention to Qiao Tianrui's activities, and ended with: "Your Shuming." Li Baichuan was so angry that he crumpled the letter.
    51  Mother Li walked in, and seeing his fiery eyes, broke out in a sweat. She said in a low voice that someone had come looking for him earlier, and also told her that two public security personnel had come to the village.
    52  Li Baichuan cursed: "That's utter nonsense! I'm not a spy or counter-revolutionary, why would the Public Security Bureau look for me? Are you crazy!" Then, he told her to bring Yinghua back.

    并社（十三）
    屠鸿痕改编·江　荧　画
    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    49　李百川烦恼地回到了家，家里一个人也没有。想抽烟，烟袋又不知丢在哪儿了。忽然瞥见莺花的小大氅，便拉过来往兜里掏卷烟的纸。
    50　不想掏出一封折成三角形的信来，拆开看时，头上是一行小字：“亲爱的花妹！”接着说要注意乔天瑞的活动，末了是：“你的树明”，气得李百川把信揉了。
    51　李大妈走进来，一见他那双火星星的眼睛，便出了一身汗。她低声下气地说，刚才有人来找过，还告诉他，有两个公安人员进村来了。
    52　李百川大骂：“简直胡说，我又不是特务反革命，公安局找我？你疯啦！”接着，叫把莺花找回来。
