Xinhua News Agency report:

    The eleven Youth League supervisory posts active in the Huainan Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory have recently put forward eighty-nine criticisms, suggestions, and commendations beneficial to production in the past two months. These activities have played a significant role in assisting factory leadership to eliminate shortcomings in production, uphold the policy of safe production, and oppose bureaucracy.

    Since the factory decided to expand the foundry workshop building, it dismantled the doors and walls near the steel furnaces in April. However, the Basic Construction Section dragged its feet for more than two months without continuing the expansion project, leaving the steel furnace workers exposed to sun and rain during their work. One night in June, a sudden wind and rainstorm caused continuous sparks in the electrical wires on the steel furnace. The workers promptly took measures to cover it, avoiding a major casualty accident of steel furnace explosion. The next day, the Youth League supervisory post wrote an alarm titled "Look, Factory Director," demanding that the factory director quickly resolve the issue. After seeing the alarm, the Party Committee Secretary immediately went to the site for inspection and quickly studied and adopted measures with the factory director. That afternoon, a shed was built with canvas to temporarily shield the steel furnace, and the expansion project also started on the third day.

    After entering the summer, the temperature in the workshop was very high, and many workers felt dizzy while working. The supervisory post believed that this issue was important and put forward seven suggestions to solve the problem of excessive temperature in the workshop. For example, the No. 3 section of the mechanical workshop had a low ceiling and poor ventilation equipment. Workers had requested the installation of electric fans as early as 1954, but it had never been resolved. This year, the supervisory post suggested installing fan blades on both ends of old motors to replace electric fans. The workshop director supported their suggestion, and the workshop quickly installed self-made electric fans. The workers said: "A problem that was not solved for two years was solved as soon as the supervisory post supervised it."

    In June, the inspector of the factory's repair workshop failed to implement a mobile spot-check system, resulting in quality accidents for three young workers, scrapping three hundred and thirty-five screw caps in one instance. The supervisory post immediately made a serious criticism of the inspector's work attitude. Later, the inspector's work improved greatly, and he strengthened contact with the workers, often educating the workers who produced defective products. Now, the number of defective products in this workshop has been greatly reduced, and the phenomenon of batch scrapping has been basically eliminated.

    The fighting role played by these eleven Youth League supervisory posts, with ninety-five members, in production has been warmly welcomed and supported by the factory leaders and the masses of workers. Many workers are able to proactively report the problems and opinions they discover to the supervisory posts.

    青年团监督岗发挥战斗作用
    据新华社讯　活跃在淮南蔡家岗矿山机械厂里的十一个青年团监督岗，最近两个月里提出了八十九件有利于生产的批评、建议和表扬。这些活动在协助厂的领导上消除生产中的缺点、坚持安全生产的方针和反对官僚主义等方面起了很大的作用。
    这个厂自从决定扩建铸工车间厂房后，四月份就把靠铸钢炉的门和墙拆掉了。但是基本建设科竟拖了两个多月没有继续进行扩建工程，使铸钢炉工人在工作的时候受到日晒雨淋。六月的一天夜晚，突然一阵狂风暴雨，铸钢炉子上的电线不断发生电火花，职工们及时进行了抢盖，避免了一次钢炉爆炸的重大伤亡事故。第二天，青年团监督岗就以“厂长你看”为题写了警报，要求厂长迅速解决。党委书记看到警报后，马上到现场检查，迅速和厂长研究采取措施。当天下午，就用帆布搭了棚，临时把铸钢炉挡起来，第三天扩建工程也动工了。
    入夏以后车间温度很高，许多工人在工作的时候感到头昏。监督岗认为这个问题很重要，就提出了七项建议，解决了车间温度太高的问题。如机械车间三段的房子矮，通风设备差，早在1954年工人就要求安装电风扇，但始终没有得到解决。今年监督岗建议把旧马达的两头安上风叶子代替电风扇来使用。车间主任支持了他们的建议，车间里很快就安装上了自制的电风扇。工人们说：“两年没解决的问题，监督岗一监督就解决了。”
    六月份，这个厂修理车间的检查员由于没有实行流动抽查制，使三个青工出了质量事故，一次车废了三百三十五个螺丝帽。监督岗立即对检查员的工作态度进行了严肃的批评。后来检查员的工作有了很大改进，加强了和工人的联系，经常对出废品的工人进行教育。现在，这个车间的废品大大减少，基本上消灭了成批报废的现象。
    这十一个有九十五名岗员的青年团监督岗在生产上发挥的战斗作用，受到了厂里领导和职工群众的热烈欢迎和支持。许多工人都能把自己发现的问题和意见，主动地反映给监督岗。
