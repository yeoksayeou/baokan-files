Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th - A type of Soviet Large White pig, weighing up to a thousand *jin* (approximately 500 kilograms), has now been bred to over a thousand head at the Dongling Experimental Farm of the Shenyang Agricultural College. To date, the Dongling Experimental Farm of the Shenyang Agricultural College has promoted over five hundred head to more than ten relevant units in Harbin, Anhui, and other places.

The Soviet Large White pig is the most outstanding pig breed in the Soviet Union, imported into our country in 1950. Its characteristics are many piglets and rapid development. On average, each litter produces twelve and a half piglets. After weaning at two and a half months, the piglets generally weigh about thirty-five *jin* (approximately 17.5 kilograms); in six months, they can grow to two hundred *jin* (approximately 100 kilograms) (generally, pigs need one year). This type of pig is cold-resistant, can eat roughage, and has strong disease resistance, making it very suitable for raising in rural areas of our country; its skin is thin, the meat is fine, and the proportion of fat and lean is appropriate, making it more delicious and palatable than ordinary pork.

    苏联千斤大白猪
    在沈阳繁殖了一千多头
    新华社沈阳17日电　一种重达千斤的苏联大白猪，现在已经在沈阳农学院东陵实验农场繁殖了一千多头。到目前，沈阳农学院东陵实验农场已向哈尔滨、安徽等地十余个有关单位推广了五百多头。
    苏联大白猪是苏联最优秀的猪种，1950年输入我国。它的特点是产仔多、发育快。平均每窝生猪崽十二个半，猪崽在两个半月断乳之后，一般都重达三十五斤左右；六个月的时间，即可长到二百斤重（一般猪需一年时间）。这种猪耐寒、能吃粗食、抗病力强，很适合于我国农村饲养；它的皮薄肉细、肥瘦相应，比一般猪肉鲜美适口。
