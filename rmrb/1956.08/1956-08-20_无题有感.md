Thoughts on an Untitled Subject
Zhong Huai

Those who welcome criticism are all the same, but those who reject criticism have their own excuses.

“You are only a probationary party member, what qualifications do you have to offer opinions to formal party members!” Wang Jie, deputy manager of the Yunnan Provincial Timber Company, said this to a staff member who wrote articles in the newspaper criticizing the work of leaders.

This is one of the new excuses among many used to reject criticism.

In some rural areas, the trend of "collective buying and selling" is prevalent.

This is the case in Huayuan Township, Pixian County, Sichuan. Do you want to buy rice? The grain station implements a "collective rice buying slip" method. Please queue up and wait until there are seven or eight or even more than ten people, and then the staff will write the amount of rice you want to buy on one slip, and then ask you to "collectively" go to the mill to collect the rice. Do you want to exchange rapeseed for oil? The oil company's supply point also implements the same "collective oil exchange" method; they will not exchange it if you don't go as a "collective."

Apart from some ulterior motives, there is also a plausible reason: to strengthen the "collectivism" of farmers.

Think carefully, what real benefits will this kind of "collectivism" bring to the farmers?

    欢迎批评的人都是一样的，拒绝批评的人各有各的借口。
    “你是一个候补党员，有什么资格向正式党员提意见呢！”云南省木材公司副经理王杰对在报纸上写稿批评领导的工作人员如是说。
    这是许多拒绝批评的借口中的一种新的借口。
    在某些农村里流行着“集体买卖”的风气。
    四川郫县花园乡就是这样。你要买米吗？粮站实行的是“集体开条买米”的办法。请先排队等候，等到有了七、八个人乃至十多个人，工作人员才把你们要买的米开在一张条子上，再请你们“集体”到碾子上取米。你要拿菜籽去换油吗？油脂公司的供应点实行的同样是“集体换油”办法，不是“集体”去就不给换。
    这样做，除了某种不可告人的目的外，还有一个冠冕堂皇的理由：为了加强农民的“集体主义”。
    仔细想一想，这种“集体主义”对农民真正会有什么好处吗？
