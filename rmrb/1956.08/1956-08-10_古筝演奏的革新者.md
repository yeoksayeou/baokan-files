　　Innovator of Guzheng Performance
　　Li Ling
　　For the past six or seven days, during the national music week's performance of ethnic musical instruments, I haven't heard Guzheng music that impressed me as freshly and profoundly as Zhao Yuzhai's.

　　On the first night of the Liaoning delegation's performance, although the malfunctioning loudspeaker affected the performance of "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest", those sitting closer to the front were still able to appreciate the outstanding advantages of his performance.

　　"Celebrating the Bumper Harvest" is a new composition by Zhao Yuzhai, expressing the people's joy for a bountiful harvest through the Guzheng. This intent is somewhat palpable to the audience; however, I don't want to discuss his composition in depth. Here, I only want to focus on introducing his performance, although the performance and his composition are so inseparable.

　　In Zhao Yuzhai's outstanding performance, we discover how earnestly, boldly, and creatively he has developed the Guzheng's expressive function.

　　His greatest originality is reflected in the use of his left hand. The general traditional Guzheng playing method mostly uses the left hand to press and flick the strings. He has taken reference from piano (and actually also harp) playing methods, liberating the left hand, enabling it to play both melodies and harmonies, thereby enriching the life of this ancient instrument.

　　For the use of ancient ethnic musical instruments, like Mr. Pu Xuezhai, adopting a rigorous, pure, and meticulous traditional approach to performing Chinese classical music, preserving the original style of ancient melodies, is correct and very necessary. But at the same time, we also demand that new and more abundant modern playing methods be created boldly, casting off the old to bring forth the new, to expand the performance of ethnic instruments. This does not contradict the former approach.

　　Many of our ethnic musical instruments still have great potential that has not been well developed. Mr. Liu Tianhua's improvement of the Erhu playing method, and the development of finger movements on the Cantonese Erhu by Lu Wencheng and others, are great contributions to the performance of ethnic musical instruments. Zhao Yuzhai's creative application of the Guzheng can be said to be inheriting the outstanding achievements of these predecessors in the innovation of ethnic musical instruments.

　　Because of his efforts, he has opened a new path for the performance improvement of this type of ethnic plucked instrument; it has also expanded the world of Guzheng music composition.

　　Zhao Yuzhai's performance is extremely remarkable. Not only is the sound clear, accurate, and delicate, but especially precious is his keen and profound musical sense. His playing is complex in its variations and rich in its expression, deeply capturing people's hearts. Many of the new playing methods, such as chord tones and alternating methods, are also unprecedented.

　　The famous ethnic musical instrument performer Mr. Jiang Fengzhi said: "This is an outstanding talent, an innovator of Guzheng performance." I think this statement is not an exaggeration.

　　I hope that the music community can attach importance to this highly significant new attempt. If this spirit of reform can be brought to other ethnic musical instruments that can be innovated, it will surely increase the effectiveness and brilliance of our ethnic musical instrument performances.

　　[Note: How to find ways to expand the volume of such instruments (including the Guqin, Pipa, etc.) is a problem that urgently needs to be solved at present. If their strings can be increased at the same time, they would become very ideal instruments. ]

### 古筝演奏的革新者

    古筝演奏的革新者
    李凌
    六七天来，在全国音乐周的民族乐器演奏中，我还没有听到过像赵玉斋这样给我印象新鲜、深刻的古筝音乐。
    在辽宁代表队演出的第一天晚上，他所表演的“庆丰年”，虽然由于扩音器发生故障，影响到演出效果；但是，坐在比较前面的听众，依然能够较好地领会到他的特出的表演的优点。
    “庆丰年”是赵玉斋的新创作，借着古筝来表现人民对丰收的欢欣喜悦。这种企图，是多少能使听众感受到的；但是我不想深谈他的曲作。这里，我只想着重介绍他的演奏，虽然演奏和他的作曲如此不可分割。
    在赵玉斋的突出的表演里，我们发见他是如何认真、大胆、创造性地发挥了古筝的表现功能。
    他的最大的独创，表现在左手的使用上。一般的传统弹筝方法，多是左手用来压音、捺音。他参考了钢琴（其实竖琴也是如此）的弹法，把左手解放出来，同时能弹奏音调和和声，从而丰富了这个古老乐器的生命。
    对于民族古乐器的使用，像溥雪斋老先生那样，严紧、纯正、一丝不苟地采取传统的方法，来演奏中国古典乐曲，保存古曲原来的风格，是正确的，非常必要的。但是同时，我们也要求推陈出新地、大胆地创造近代的、更丰富的新的弹奏方法，以扩大民族乐器的性能。这和前一种做法并不矛盾。
    我们好些民族乐器，还有着极大的潜在力，没有得到很好的发挥。刘天华先生对南胡演奏法的改进，吕文成等人对广东二胡走指的发展，都是对民族乐器演奏的极大贡献。赵玉斋对古筝的创造性的应用，可以说是继承了这些先辈对民族乐器革新的特出的劳绩。
    由于他的努力，给之这样一类的民族弹奏乐器的演奏改进上，开了一条新的道路；也给古筝音乐创作扩大了天地。
    赵玉斋的表演是非常卓越的。不仅是弹音清晰、准确、细致，特别宝贵的是敏锐而深厚的音乐感。他的弹奏，变化复杂、表现丰美，深深地抓住人心。其中许多新的弹法，如和弦音、交替法等，也是前人所没有的。
    著名的民族乐器演奏家蒋风之先生说：“这是一个特出的人才，是演奏古筝的革新者。”我想这句话一点也不过火。
    我愿望音乐界能够重视这一带有极大意义的新尝试，如果能把这种改革的精神，带到其他可以革新的民族乐器中去，一定会增加我国民族乐器表演的效能和光彩。
    〔附注　如何设法来扩大这类乐器（包括古琴、琵琶等）的音量，这是目前急需解决的问题。如果同时能增加它们的音弦，就会成为很理想的乐器了。
