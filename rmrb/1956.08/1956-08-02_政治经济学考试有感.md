    Reflections on the Political Economy Exam
  　Wang Bing
    Many organizations and many comrades are studying political economy. Because work in the organizations is busy, study is usually very intense. Recently, because of the upcoming exam, the intensity has reached a fever pitch. Some people have no heart for work, reading the political economy textbook whenever they have a spare moment; some people simply don't go to work, hiding at home to review political economy; some people are burning the midnight oil, and although they go to work during the day, they are mentally distracted and their work efficiency is not high; some people are suffering from insomnia because of burning the midnight oil; some people are even reciting the provisions of political economy in their sleep... A cadre in a certain organization wrote the important formulas and definitions of political economy on a card and put it on the handlebars of his bicycle, using his commuting time to recite them while riding. Due to excessive concentration, he almost had a traffic accident on the street.
    Where does this "unprecedentedly high" enthusiasm for learning come from? In addition to what some leading organizations believe is due to the broad masses of cadres' consciousness and positive enterprising spirit, it is said that there are some other reasons. Coupled with the high requirements for the answer points of the exam review questions, many people have to "desperately" review for the exam!
    From a teaching point of view, exams are very necessary, but there should be different requirements for different people. For political work cadres, technical and business cadres, and administrative leading cadres, should the requirement be "uniform progress" and "all-round development"? Or should it be "different according to the nature of the work"? Judging from the current teaching methods and exam requirements, some leading organizations seem to have forgotten that in-service cadres are each shouldering a certain amount of work, and that the work is generally very heavy. They are attempting to train all cadres to become theoretical instructors, and the requirements for cadres of different levels, ages, and work situations are not "different," but forced uniformity.
    "We should study political theory," this is already a well-known truth, and there are not many people who are unwilling to study theory or oppose studying political theory. But can the learning methods be improved? Absolutely. For example, the pace can be slowed down further, and the requirements should not be too high... If the leading organizations agree, it might be a good idea, in the spirit of not forcing uniformity, to allow those who want to attend lectures to organize lectures, and those who want to study on their own to organize self-study. The best way is to open more short-term rotating training classes (non-residential), studying for one month to forty days. Calculated by actual study hours, this is equivalent to one year of part-time study (half a day of study per week). In this way, no matter how busy the work in the organization is, everyone can take the time to concentrate on studying once within a year. Both work and study can be done with concentration, and efficiency can be improved. This avoids half-day study becoming a case of "three days fishing, two days drying nets," causing constant mental strain and little actual benefit, while also significantly affecting the improvement of work and business skills.

    政治经济学考试有感
  　王冰
    很多机关很多同志都在学习政治经济学，因为机关工作忙碌，平时学习就很紧张，近来因为要考试，紧张到了白热化的程度。有些人无心工作，一有空就读政治经济学教科书；有些人干脆不上班，躲在家里复习政治经济学；有些人开了“夜车”，白天虽然上班，但是精神恍惚，工作效率不高；有些人因为开“夜车”而失眠；还有的人睡着的时候还在背诵政治经济学的条文……。某机关一个干部，把政治经济学上的重要公式和定义写成一张卡片，放在自行车的车把上，利用上下班的时间，一面骑车一面背诵，由于精神过度集中，差一点在街上发生车祸。
    这种“空前高涨”的学习热情从哪里来的？除了像某些领导学习的机关认为是广大干部的自觉性和积极的进取心所致以外，据说还有一些其他原因。再加上考试复习题的答案要点要求高，因此，很多人就不得不“拼命”复习应考！
    考试，从教学的观点上看，是非常必要的，但对不同的人应有不同的要求。对政治工作干部、技术业务干部、行政领导干部，是要求“进度统一”和“全面发展”呢？还是根据工作性质而“有所不同”呢？从现在的讲课方法和考试题的要求来看，某些领导学习的机关，似乎把在职干部每人都担负了一定的工作，而且工作一般都很繁重的情况忘记了，企图把干部都培养成理论教员，对不同水平、不同年岁、不同工作情况的干部，要求不是“有所不同”，而是强求统一。
    “应该学习政治理论”，这已是人所共知的道理，不愿学习理论或反对学习政治理论的人是不多的。但是学习的方法是不是可以作些改进呢？完全可以。比方说，进度再放慢点，要求不要太高……。如果领导学习的机关同意，不妨本着不强求统一的精神，愿听课的组织听课，愿自学的组织自学；最好的办法，希望多多开办一些短期轮训班（走读），学习一个月到四十天。按实际学习小时来计算，相当于一年的半日制（每周半天学习）。这样不管机关工作怎么忙，每个人都可在一年之内抽出时间集中学习一次。工作时、学习时，精神都可以集中，效率都可以提高。免得半日制学习，三天打鱼、两天晒网，弄得精神经常紧张，实际收效并不太大，而对工作和业务技术的提高却影响不浅。
