    Strictly Prevent Pesticide Poisoning Accidents
    Strengthen Education on Safe Use of Pesticides
    Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, is a cotton-producing area. Cotton farmers here generally use pesticides such as "1605" to control cotton insects. However, some farmers are unaware of its potency, leading to frequent poisoning accidents. Huang Guoying, the director of the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative in Nanji Township, saw that the oxen in front of his door were covered with lice and mosquitoes, causing them to jump around restlessly. He sprayed the leftover "1605" pesticide from the cotton field onto the oxen. Although the lice and mosquitoes on the oxen died, the oxen also died from poisoning in less than an hour. Du Shenguang of the Second Agricultural Cooperative in Xingfu Township, Yangpei Township, washed a manure bucket that had contained "1059" pesticide in the fish pond in front of his door, and all the fish in the pond died within two hours.
    Although many pesticide poisoning incidents have occurred in this area, some people are still indifferent. Seven female members of the Wangjiazui Agricultural Cooperative in Nanji Township were spraying pesticides in the field without wearing masks or long pants. A comrade passing by repeatedly explained to them, "1059 is highly poisonous and can easily kill people. You must take protective measures when spraying pesticides." They jokingly replied, "Our lives aren't that valuable, it doesn't matter." Therefore, I suggest that the supply departments and technical guidance departments effectively strengthen publicity and technical guidance on the safe use of pesticides, and actively prevent pesticide poisoning incidents.

    Where is the Cause of Poisoning?
    Recently, many agricultural cooperatives have experienced poisoning accidents when using pesticides. Ye Zexue and four others from the Nandi Cooperative in Xiaotai Township, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, ate cantaloupe without washing their hands after using "1605," resulting in all five being poisoned. If it hadn't been for timely rescue, they would have been in mortal danger. Ye Zexue, who was severely poisoned, was still unconscious twenty hours later. After this accident, many cooperative members were afraid to spray pesticides, saying they were "afraid of being poisoned." However, people have not thought about it: what is the real cause of poisoning?
            (Fu Hengqian)
    Courage Used in the Wrong Place
    "1605" is highly toxic. If you are not careful in its use, transportation, and storage, poisoning and death accidents can occur. On the morning of June 28, when Xiao Jinzhong, the director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Beiyuan Township, Nanmu District, Nanbu County, Sichuan, was using "1605," the technician Zhang Dahai said, "This medicine is potent, it can kill people." Xiao said, "You always make it sound so scary, I don't believe it. Watch me lick this medicine!" As he spoke, he actually licked it. Zhang Dahai was so anxious that he immediately told him to take the antidote "Atropine," but he said, "You always say it's very dangerous, I don't think anything will happen." His mother came and forced him to take two tablets of "Atropine," but it was too late. He fainted after walking two ridges. He was sent to the hospital, but he could not be saved. (Tian Qiyu)
    Doctors Should Learn Rescue Methods
    The widely promoted pesticide 1605 is very popular among farmers. However, it is very unsafe for humans and animals, and poisoning accidents occur frequently in many areas where it is used. Strictly preventing poisoning is a positive measure, but how to rescue people after poisoning is also a serious problem.
    Some doctors do not understand the nature of this pesticide and do not know how to treat it. Some rural workers or farmers know that "Atropine" can be used to rescue 1605 poisoning, but they do not understand the usage of this drug and do not understand the nature of "Atropine," so there is also a phenomenon of abuse of "Atropine" leading to poisoning.
    I believe that hospitals and health departments in towns and cities should be familiar with this new pesticide, 1605, and should learn how to rescue poisoning victims and increase rescue equipment. Areas supplying "Atropine" should also inform users of the method of use.

### 严防农药中毒事故

    严防农药中毒事故
    加强安全使用农药教育
    湖北新洲县是个棉产区，这里的棉农，普遍使用“1605”等农药除治棉虫，由于有些农民不知道它的厉害，不断地发生中毒事故。南极乡第六农业社的社主任黄国英，夜晚乘凉时，看见门前的耕牛身上尽是虱子、蚊虫，咬得牛乱跳，他便把在棉地里没有打完的“1605”药水，喷在牛身上。牛身上的虱子、蚊虫虽然死了，但是，不到一点钟，牛也被毒死了。杨裴乡幸福农业社二社杜甚光，由于把装过“1059”农药的粪桶，拿到门前养鱼塘里洗刷，不到两点钟，一塘鱼死光了。
    这个地区虽然发生了许多农药中毒事件，但是有些人还很麻痹。南极乡的汪家咀农业社的七个妇女社员在地里打农药，不戴口罩又不穿长裤，一个过路的同志再三向她们解释说：“1059容易毒死人，打药时必须作好防护工作。”她们还开玩笑似的回答：我们的性命不甘贵，没有关系”。因此我建议供应部门和技术指导部门切实加强安全使用农药的宣传和技术指导，积极防止农药中毒事件发生。（白本）
    中毒的原因在哪里
    近来有许多农业社在使用农药的时候，出现了中毒伤人事故。湖北省沔阳县肖台乡南堤社叶泽学等五人，在使用“1605”之后没洗手，拿着香瓜就吃，结果五人都中了毒，不是急救及时，就有致命的危险。其中中毒严重的叶泽学，二十小时后还不省人事。在这件事故发生之后，许多社员都不敢打药了，说是“怕中毒”。可是，人们却没有想一想：究竟中毒的原因何在？
            （傅恒谦）
    胆量用的不是地方
    “1605”的毒性很大，在使用、搬运、保管中，如不谨慎，就会发生中毒伤亡事故。六月二十八日上午，四川南部县楠木区碑院乡先蜂农业社主任肖进忠使用“1605”的时候，技术员张大怀说：“这种药厉害，能毒死人”。肖却说：“你总说得那末凶，我就不信。你看我还要舐这个药！”说着他果然舐了一下。张大怀急得马上叫他吃解毒药“阿妥品”，他还说：“你总说凶得很，我看就不会怎样。”他母亲赶来，才强迫他吃了两片“阿妥品”，但是已经迟了，走了两根田坎就昏倒了。送到医院去，也没有救活。（田祈雨）
    医生应学会抢救办法
    现在大量推广的农药1605很受农民欢迎。但是它对人畜很不安全，许多使用的地区时常发生中毒事故。严防中毒是积极的办法，但是如何抢救中毒后的人也是一个严重的问题。
    有些医生不懂这种农药的性质，不会治疗。有些农村工作人员或农民虽然知道用“阿妥品”可以解救1605的中毒，但是他们不了解这种药的使用单位，不明白“阿妥品”的性质，因此又有滥用“阿妥品”而中毒的现象。
    我认为，市镇的医院和卫生部门应该熟悉1605这种新的农药，应该学习抢救中毒的办法和增加救治的设备。供应“阿妥品”的地区，还应该告诉备用者使用的方法。
