Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 3rd: The two raw material warehouses and the employee dormitories, covering over 2,300 square meters, that are part of the expansion project at the state-owned Anhui Paper Mill are now basically completed. The foundation work for the main factory building, which will house two newly added paper machines, is currently under construction. It is expected that the entire expansion project will be completed in the first half of next year. At that time, the annual output of the Anhui Paper Mill will more than triple its current level, making it a large factory manufacturing cigarette paper.

The expansion of the Anhui Paper Mill is being expedited at the decision of the Ministry of Light Industry, according to the needs of national economic development. The expansion project includes the main factory building, a calcium carbonate workshop, warehouses, and employee dormitories, as well as water supply, power supply equipment, and the reconstruction of the factory's dedicated railway line.

To ensure the smooth progress of the expansion project, the factory began placing orders both domestically and internationally in January of this year, and also transferred personnel to strengthen the capital construction organization. At present, most of the various materials and equipment have been successively delivered.

The director of the Anhui Paper Mill told reporters: Although the scale of this expansion is very large, the construction time is greatly shortened compared to when the factory was first built. Due to the increase in production, the relative reduction in enterprise management personnel, and the strengthening of cooperation between enterprises, the investment per ton of cigarette paper produced after the expansion will only be 62% of what it was before the expansion. The investment in this expansion can be fully recovered within one year and four months.

    安徽造纸厂全面扩建
    据新华社合肥3日电　国营安徽造纸厂扩建的两座原料仓库和两千三百多平方公尺的职工宿舍，现在基本完工了。可以容纳新增加两台造纸机的主厂房的基础工程，正在施工。预计全部扩建工程明年上半年可以完工。那时，安徽造纸厂的年产量将比现在提高两倍以上，成为一个很大的制造卷烟纸的工厂。
    安徽造纸厂的扩建工程，是轻工业部根据国民经济发展的需要而决定提前进行的。扩建的工程包括主厂房、碳酸钙车间、仓库及职工宿舍，还有供水、供电设备和改建厂内铁道专用线等工程。
    这个厂为保证扩建工程顺利进行，从今年一月开始在国内外订货，并且抽调人员充实基本建设机构。现在，各种器材设备已大部分陆续运到。
    安徽造纸厂厂长对记者说：这次扩建的规模虽然很大，但是建设时间比建厂的时候大为缩短。由于产量的增加，企业管理人员相对的减少，以及加强了企业间的协作，扩建以后每增产一吨卷烟纸的投资额，只及扩建以前的62％。这次扩建的投资，可以在一年零四个月的时间之内全部收回。
