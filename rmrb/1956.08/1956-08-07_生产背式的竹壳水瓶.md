    Producing Back-Style Bamboo-Sheathed Water Bottles
    Bamboo-sheathed thermos bottles have become a necessity for farmers' lives. People need to keep thermos bottles at home, carry them to the fields, and shepherds also need to carry one on their backs. However, the thermos bottles sold on the market are all round. Shepherds have to tie these bamboo-sheathed thermos bottles to their bodies with ropes, which is very inconvenient when walking. It would be best to produce some back-style bamboo-sheathed water bottles. (Fang Quanfa)

    生产背式的竹壳水瓶
    竹壳热水瓶，已经成了农民的生活必需品。家里要搁热水瓶，下地要带热水瓶，放羊的也要背一只热水瓶。但是市上出卖的热水瓶都是圆形的，放羊的只好把这种竹壳热水瓶用绳子五花大绑的绑到身上，走起路来很不方便。最好生产一些背式的竹壳水瓶。（方全法）
