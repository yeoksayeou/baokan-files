Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th — Teachers and students from the Northeast Pharmaceutical College, who were conducting production practice in Qian Mountain (near Anshan), a famous scenic spot in the Northeast, discovered wild ginseng in the practice area.

The teachers and students dug up 48 seedlings in an area of two square meters. They have transplanted the wild ginseng seedlings to the medicinal herb garden of the Northeast Pharmaceutical College in Shenyang for research. The teachers and students judged from the growth of the excavated ginseng that the reserves of Qian Mountain ginseng may be very large.

Wild ginseng is a precious medicinal material and production is not large. In the past, it was generally believed that ginseng was only produced in the Changbai Mountain range. This discovery of ginseng in Qian Mountain is not only significant for meeting medical and export needs, but also for increasing the sideline income of farmers in mountainous areas.

    千山发现野山人参
    新华社沈阳16日电　在东北名胜——千山（鞍山附近）进行生产实习的东北药学院师生，在实习地区发现了野山人参。
    师生们在两平方公尺的面积上就挖到四十八苗。他们已把野山人参苗移植到沈阳东北药学院的药草园中进行研究。师生们从挖掘出的山参的生长情况判断，认为千山山参的蕴藏量可能很多。
    野山人参是一种珍贵药材，产量不大，过去一般人认为只在长白山脉一带才产山参。这次在千山发现山参不但对满足医疗和出口需要有意义，而且还能增加山区农民的副业收入。
