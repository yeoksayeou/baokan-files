Recently, Yan Chengping, the head of the personnel section of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, and Xu Zhanli, the head of the health department, and other leading cadres have been listless and bleary-eyed during working hours. According to Section Chief Yan himself, "This is because he is suffering from a severe stomach ailment."

In fact, the real reason for his mental fatigue is not a "severe stomach ailment" at all, but because he is seriously addicted to "playing mahjong." Since last winter, a few people headed by Section Chief Yan and Director Xu have regarded playing mahjong as a form of cultural entertainment. They often get together to play mahjong after work, often from 7 o'clock until midnight, and sometimes even until dawn, before "ending the battle" amid yawns.

Working "overtime" like this at night, how can one not be bleary-eyed and listless during the day? It is no wonder that people are asking: Why is the enthusiasm of leading cadres who are the head of the personnel section and the head of the health department not as high as their enthusiasm for "playing mahjong" when it comes to the cause of socialist construction?

    颜科长的“加班加点”
    最近太原工程局的人事科科长颜承平和卫生处处长徐展力等几个领导干部在工作时间总是没精打采、睡眼蒙矓的，据颜科长自己说：“这是因为他患着严重的肠胃病”。
    其实造成他精神萎靡的真正原因，却完全不是什么“严重的肠胃病”，而是因为他严重的沉醉于“打麻将”的缘故。从去年冬季以来，以颜科长和徐处长为首的几个人，把打麻将作为文化娱乐，经常在下班以后，凑在一起打麻将，常常从七时打到半夜，有时甚至打到天明，才在呵欠声中“结束战斗”。
    晚上这样“加班加点”，白天怎么能不睡眼蒙矓无精打采呢？这就难怪人们要提出责问：身为人事科长和卫生处长的领导干部，为什么对于社会主义建设事业的热情还不及“打麻将”的热情来得高？
