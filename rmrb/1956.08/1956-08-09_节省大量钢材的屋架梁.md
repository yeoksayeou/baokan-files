(Xinhua News Agency) A prestressed composite roof truss beam that can save a large amount of steel has recently been successfully trial-produced. The trial production was carried out by the Fifth Construction Company of the Architectural Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry with the assistance of scientific research institutions.

The trial production was of an eighteen-meter span roof truss beam, which is assembled from six individual blocks. Each block is three meters long and weighs about nine hundred kilograms.

This type of roof truss beam is being trial-produced for the first time in China. It saves 63% of steel compared to steel roof trusses, and about 32% of steel compared to ordinary reinforced concrete roof trusses. The larger the span of the beam, the more steel is saved.

The individual blocks of this type of beam are standardized and small in volume. They can be used to form beams of various spans such as twelve meters, fifteen meters, eighteen meters, and twenty-four meters. The blocks can be mass-produced in ordinary prefabricated reinforced concrete workshops or open-air prefabrication yards, and then assembled into a whole at the construction site for prestressing. Therefore, under current conditions, this type of roof truss beam can be mass-produced and widely used.

The Architectural Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is now preparing to vigorously promote this structure in order to replace steel roof trusses and save the country more steel.

### 节省大量钢材的屋架梁

    节省大量钢材的屋架梁
    据新华社讯　一种可以大量节省钢材的预应力组合屋架梁最近试制成功。试制工作是由冶金工业部建筑局第五建筑总公司在科学研究机关的协助下进行的。
    这次试制的是一根十八公尺跨度的房架梁，它是由六块单个块体拼装而成。每块的长度为三公尺，重量约九百公斤左右。
    这种屋架梁在我国还是第一次试制。它比钢屋架节省钢材63％；比普通钢筋混凝土屋架节省钢材32％左右。梁的跨度越大，节省的钢材就越多。
    这种梁的单个块体都是定型化的，体积不大，可以用它组成十二公尺、十五公尺、十八公尺、二十四公尺等各种不同跨度的梁。块体可以在普通的装配式钢筋混凝土车间或露天预制场上大量生产，然后再到施工现场组合成整体，进行预加应力。因此，在目前条件下，这种屋架梁可以大量制造和广泛应用。
    现在，冶金工业部建筑局准备大力推广这种结构，以便用它来代替钢屋架，为国家节约更多的钢材。
