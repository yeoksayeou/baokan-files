    Playing Ghost and Other Matters
    Shi Liuming
    The Hebei Daily reported a strange incident on August 8th:

    Du Changshun, propaganda committee member of the trade union in the No. 2 spinning workshop of the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, in order to prevent night shift workers from dozing off while working, asked Yao Guoyong, a workshop propagandist, to dress up as a ghost to scare the workers. On the night of May 28th, Du Changshun helped Yao Guoyong make a tall, pointed hat decorated with red, green, and other colors. Yao Guoyong wore this hat, painted a "ghost face" on his face, and walked into the workshop. He made strange noises and patted the shoulder of a female worker, Li Chunhua. This sudden attack scared Li Chunhua into a daze, and she later became mentally unstable, and had not recovered by July. It is said that this was not the first time this practice had occurred in this factory.

    Everyone agrees that it is wrong to replace patient education of workers with simple and crude methods; however, some people often adopt them. For example, arbitrarily deducting wages, abusing disciplinary actions, and so on. The only difference between these practices and Du Changshun's "creation" is that one focuses on material things, and the other focuses on the spirit. Naturally, this is the easiest leadership method, but unfortunately, they did not expect that the result would be so heavy.

    装鬼及其他

    八月八日的河北日报上，登了一件奇事：
    唐山华新纺织厂二场细纱车间工会宣传委员杜长顺，为了防止夜班工人在工作的时候打瞌睡，找到车间宣传员姚国庸，让他装鬼去吓唬工人。五月二十八日夜晚，杜长顺帮着姚国庸做了一顶红红绿绿的高顶尖帽子，姚国庸戴上这顶帽子，脸上涂着“鬼脸”，走进了车间。他一面怪叫，一面用手去拍女工李春华的肩膀。这个突然袭击，把李春华吓晕了，后来变成了傻子，到七月份还没有医治好。据说，在这个厂里，这种做法并不是第一次。
    用简单的、粗暴的方式代替对工人的耐心教育，谁都承认这是错误的；但是，却有人常常采用。比如随便扣罚工资，滥加处分等等都是。这些做法同杜长顺的“创造”所不同的，只是一个重在物质，一个重在精神。自然，这是一种最轻松的领导方法，然而可惜，没有想到所收到的结果却是这般沉重。
