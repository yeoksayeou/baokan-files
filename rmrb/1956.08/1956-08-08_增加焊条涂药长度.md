    Increase Welding Rod Coating Length
    The welding rods from Shenyang Welding Rod Factory that our factory has been using recently have a short coating, resulting in about one-tenth of each rod being wasted, which is a significant loss. We hope that the length of the uncoated portion can be shortened, just enough for the welding handle to grip it. Currently, the discarded length of the welding rod is 40-50 millimeters, but in reality, only 15-20 millimeters is needed. Other factories producing welding rods also have similar situations. We consume 40 kilograms of welding rods every day. If the welding rod factory can accept our suggestion, we can save two kilograms of welding rods every day.

    增加焊条涂药长度
    我厂最近使用的沈阳电焊条厂的焊条，由于涂药部分短，每一根焊条都有十分之一损失掉，浪费太大。我们希望能将没有涂药部分的长度缩短，只要焊把能夹住它就可以。现在扔掉的焊条长度有40—50公厘，实际有15—20公厘即可。其他生产焊条的工厂也有类似情况。我们每天耗用焊条四十公斤，如果焊条厂能接受我们的建议，每天可以节省焊条两公斤。
