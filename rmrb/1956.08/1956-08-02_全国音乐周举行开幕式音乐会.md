Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—The prelude to the first National Music Week—the opening concert—was held tonight at the Beijing Concert Hall.

    As the stage curtain rose, behind the sixty-plus member orchestra was arranged a chorus of over one hundred and twenty people, members of the Shanghai Orchestra Chorus and the Central Conservatory of Music East China Branch Chorus. Ge Chaozhi, with twenty years of conducting experience, stepped onto the podium, and the first piece—the grand chorus "Ode to the Motherland" (music by Liu Shiren, lyrics by Wang Zhongzheng and Ni Ruilin)—began. The song began, recalling the history of the motherland filled with revolutionary struggles; praising the new face of the motherland since the founding of New China; and finally, with unparalleled passion, cheering heartily for the glorious future of the motherland.

    The General Political Department Cultural Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed the first movement of the "Long March Chorus," a collaboration between musician Shi Lemeng and Chen Qitong, the author of the drama "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains."

    Beijing's ancient music performers performed a guqin ensemble "Pu'an Charm." The National Orchestra of the Central People's Broadcasting Station performed the famous piece "Bright Road" by the senior musician Liu Tianhua.

    Mongolian female singer Bao Yindelege and female vocalist Li Li, respectively, sang solos of Inner Mongolian folk songs, Qinghai folk songs, and Kazakh folk songs. Yin Chengzong, only fourteen years old, performed a piano solo. The Chorus of the Broadcasting Orchestra of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Shanghai Orchestra Chorus respectively sang works by Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and Huang Zi: "New Woman," "Yellow River Cantata," "Song of Resistance," and "The Flag is Truly Fluttering."

    The concert ended late at night. The audience erupted in thunderous applause, congratulating the concert on its success.
