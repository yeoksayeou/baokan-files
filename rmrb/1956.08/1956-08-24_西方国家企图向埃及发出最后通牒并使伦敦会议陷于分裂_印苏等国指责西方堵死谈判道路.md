Xinhua News Agency, London, August 23rd: Western countries attempted to immediately issue an ultimatum to Egypt and divide the conference at the London Conference on August 22nd. They proposed to formally present the Dulles plan, which insists on international control of the canal regardless of Egyptian sovereignty, to Egypt.
　　
At the beginning of the meeting that day, the representatives of Britain, France, and India stated their views on the American plan and the Indian plan. The head of the British delegation, Lloyd, and the head of the French delegation, Pineau, agreed with the American plan. The head of the Indian delegation, Menon, requested the rejection of the American plan, because this plan did not consider Egypt's legitimate rights over the canal, and not only did it not open the road to negotiation with Egypt, but it also blocked the road to negotiation.
　　
Menon emphasized that the Indian delegation's proposal was based on considering Egyptian sovereignty, and it could serve as the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue and guarantee the freedom of navigation on the canal.
　　
Menon said that one of the bases for discussion in the American proposal was the internationalization of the arrangements for the management of the Suez Canal. The claim put forward in the American proposal was actually: Egypt has the sovereignty to own the property, but not the sovereignty to exercise ownership. He pointed out that Egypt would not accept the American plan, and giving this plan to Egypt would only aggravate the tense situation and would not achieve the negotiation sought.
　　
Menon warned that when discussing the Suez issue, do not disregard the wishes of those countries that are moving along the road of free development. An entire continent has awakened, and it would be dangerous and reckless to ignore the interests and hopes of the people living there.
　　
Subsequently, the Spanish representative announced his support for the Dulles plan, thus increasing the number of countries supporting the so-called "majority plan" to eighteen. The Spanish representative also requested that if Egypt rejected the plan, negotiations should be tried based on the suggestions originally put forward by Spain.
　　
After this, Chairman Lloyd said that all attendees had expressed their attitude towards the two plans. He announced a half-hour break to allow delegations to consider the future work of the conference.
　　
During the break, representatives of countries supporting the American proposal held diplomatic talks. After the meeting resumed, the New Zealand representative suddenly proposed selecting representatives from the countries supporting the American plan and entrusting them to present the American plan to Egypt. The intention of this proposal was clearly to despise the alternative view expressed in the proposal put forward by the Indian delegation and supported by the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and Ceylon.
　　
The New Zealand proposal was immediately supported by Dulles, but it was firmly opposed by India, the Soviet Union, and Ceylon.
　　
Menon accused Western countries of trying to divide the conference in two. He said to Western countries, "If this is your intention, then just say so. In this way, we, who are only a minority, can consider our attitude." He said that he was not prepared to discuss procedural issues today because he needed to consult his government.
　　
Soviet representative Shepilov supported Menon, saying that it was wrong to put forward the opinions of some of the conference as if they were the opinions of the whole. He believed that the New Zealand proposal was "clearly an attempt to split the conference."
　　
Lloyd, in supporting the New Zealand proposal, said that the opinions of the eighteen countries would be presented as the opinions of the eighteen countries, and no one had suggested that any other country should be bound by the opinions of the eighteen countries. Regarding the issue of notifying Egypt of all these proposals, he said that he had guaranteed to send the entire record of the conference to the Egyptian government.
　　
Shepilov asked, who chose the representatives of the eighteen countries? Lloyd replied that the eighteen countries would choose them themselves.
　　
Shepilov said that this would split the conference into two parts. He said that the current proposal was tantamount to an ultimatum and was completely undemocratic. He also said that countries with different opinions should find normal democratic ways to present their opinions to the Egyptian government.
　　
Dulles insisted that the conference should hold a vote. He said that if the conference could not vote, it would put the conference in a dilemma. He said that the majority did not have a monopoly on the right to present their opinions to the Egyptian government. Other countries were completely free to present their opinions.
　　
The conference finally accepted India's proposal and adjourned until August 23rd.
　　
A spokesman for the Soviet delegation said at a press conference that the Soviet delegation would take appropriate steps at the meeting on August 23rd.

### 西方国家企图向埃及发出最后通牒并使伦敦会议陷于分裂  印苏等国指责西方堵死谈判道路

    西方国家企图向埃及发出最后通牒并使伦敦会议陷于分裂
    印苏等国指责西方堵死谈判道路
    据新华社伦敦23日电　西方国家在八月二十二日的伦敦会议上企图立即向埃及提出最后通牒并且使会议陷于分裂。它们提议只向埃及正式提出坚持不顾埃及主权而对运河实行国际管制的杜勒斯计划。
    在这天会议开始的时候，英国、法国和印度代表陈述了他们对美国方案和印度方案的看法。英国代表团团长劳埃德和法国代表团团长比诺赞同美国方案。印度代表团团长梅农要求拒绝美国的方案，因为这个方案没有考虑埃及对运河的合法权利，不仅没有打开同埃及谈判的道路，而且还堵死了谈判的道路。
    梅农强调指出，印度代表团的建议是以考虑埃及主权为基础的，它能够作为和平解决苏彝士运河问题和保证运河航行自由的基础。
    梅农说，美国建议中的讨论基础之一是苏彝士运河管理方面的安排的国际化，美国建议中所提出的主张实际上是：埃及有保有所有权的主权，但是没有行使所有权的主权。他指出，埃及将不会接受美国的计划，把这个计划交给埃及只会加剧紧张局势而不会得到所寻求的谈判。
    梅农警告说，在讨论苏彝士问题的时候，决不要把那些正在沿着自由发展的道路前进的国家的愿望置之不顾，一个整个的大陆已经觉醒，如果忽视居住在那里的人民的志趣和希望，那就是危险的和卤莽的。
    随后，西班牙代表宣布支持杜勒斯计划，这样，支持所谓“多数计划”的国家就增加到十八国。西班牙代表同时要求，如果埃及拒绝这个计划就应当试行以西班牙原先提出的建议为基础来进行谈判。
    在这以后，主席劳埃德说，全体到会者都已经表示了对这两个方案的态度。他宣布休息半小时使各国代表团能够考虑会议今后工作的问题。
    在休息时，支持美国建议的国家的代表进行会外交谈。在会议再次开始后，新西兰代表忽然提议从支持美国方案的国家中选出一些代表，委托他们向埃及提出美国方案。这个建议的用意显然是要蔑视印度代表团提出的并且得到苏联、印度尼西亚和锡兰支持的方案中所表示的另一种观点。
    新西兰的建议立即得到了杜勒斯的支持，但是它遭到了印度、苏联和锡兰的坚决反对。
    梅农指责西方国家设法把会议分裂为二。他对西方国家说，“如果这是你们的意图，那就这样说好了。这样，只占少数的我们就可以考虑我们的态度。”他说，他不准备在今天讨论议事程序问题，因为他需要向他的政府请示。
    苏联代表谢皮洛夫支持梅农说，把会议的部分的意见当作好像是全体的意见提出来是不对的。他认为新西兰的建议“明明白白是企图分裂会议”。
    劳埃德在支持新西兰建议的时候说，十八个国家的意见将作为十八个国家的意见提出，并没有人建议任何其他国家要受十八国意见的约束。在关于把所有这些建议通知埃及的问题上，他说，他已经保证要把会议的全部记录送给埃及政府。
    谢皮洛夫问道，谁选择十八个国家的代表呢？劳埃德回答说，由十八个国家自己选出。
    谢皮洛夫说，这就使会议分裂为两个部分。他说，目前的建议等于最后通牒，完全是不民主的。他又说，意见不同的国家要找出正常的民主方法向埃及政府提出它们的意见。
    杜勒斯坚持会议要举行表决。他说，如果会议不能表决，那就使会议陷于进退维谷的难局中。他说，多数派没有垄断向埃及政府提出它们的意见的权利。其他国家完全有自由提出它们的意见。
    会议最后接受印度的建议，休会到八月二十三日再开会。
    苏联代表团发言人在记者招待会上说，苏联代表团将在八月二十三日的会议上采取适当的步骤。
