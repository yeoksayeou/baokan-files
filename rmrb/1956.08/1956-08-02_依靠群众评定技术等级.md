    Rely on the Masses to Evaluate Technical Grades

    The Tianjin Daily published an editorial on July 27th entitled "Rely on the Masses to Evaluate Technical Grades." The editorial stated that evaluating grades is a very important task in the wage reform. To do this well, it must be determined that: technical grade standards are the only basis for evaluating grades. Those who should be promoted according to technical grade standards should be promoted without any restrictions; those who should not be promoted must not be promoted, and there should be no concessions or considerations. Currently, there are some incorrect statements circulating among workers, such as the belief that the evaluation of grades should include factors such as work attitude, labor discipline, ideological style, and mass relations, in addition to the technical grade standards. The editorial stated that if such statements are not clarified in a timely manner, it will affect the smooth progress of the grading work. The editorial pointed out that shortcomings in work attitude and ideological style should be overcome through regular education methods; the issue of labor discipline can be handled according to the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" in addition to education. The only measure of a worker's labor ability is their technical level, so grading should only be based on technical grade standards. Only in this way can it be in line with the principle of "to each according to his work" and achieve true rationality.

    The editorial stated that to evaluate the technical grades of workers, it is necessary to do a good job in propaganda and education. For example, some workers compare themselves, thinking that if they are promoted, everyone should be promoted together, and if they are not promoted, no one should be promoted; some workers have concerns about grading wages according to technical grade standards, fearing demotion or wage reduction. It is necessary to explain to those who have incorrect understandings and unnecessary concerns in a timely manner.

    The editorial emphasized that in evaluating the technical grades of workers, special attention should be paid to relying on and mobilizing the masses. Before nominations, the leadership should fully absorb the opinions of the workers and management cadres. When mobilizing the masses for discussion, they should be bold and let go, so that the masses can express their opinions without reservation. When finalizing the decision, the opinions of the workers should be fully considered in order to achieve true rationality and satisfy everyone.

    The editorial finally proposed that after learning the technical grade standards and rationally evaluating the technical grades, the enthusiasm of the workers for learning culture, technology, and production will surely be further enhanced. This requires the factory leadership to take timely measures to organize regular technical learning, so that the workers who have been promoted this time can further improve their skills, and the workers who have not met the technical standards and whose grades have been retained can also strive to meet the technical standards as soon as possible. At the same time, a regular promotion system should be established so that workers can be promoted in a timely manner after their skills have improved. By doing so, the enthusiasm of the workers can be constantly maintained and promoted, contributing more to socialist construction.

### 依靠群众评定技术等级

    依靠群众评定技术等级
    七月二十七日，天津日报以“依靠群众评定技术等级”为题，发表了一篇社论。社论说，评定等级是工资改革中的一项十分重要的工作。要做好这项工作，必须确定：技术等级标准是评定等级的唯一依据。按照技术等级标准衡量，该升级的就升级，不应该受到任何限制；不应该升级的就一定不升，不应该有任何迁就或照顾。目前，在工人中流传着一些错误的说法，如认为评定等级除根据技术等级标准以外，还要包括劳动态度、劳动纪律、思想作风、群众关系等因素。社论说，类似说法如不及时加以澄清，势将影响评级工作的顺利进行。社论指出，劳动态度和思想作风中的缺点应该用经常的教育方法来克服；劳动纪律的问题除了进行教育以外，还可以按照“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的规定办事。衡量一个工人劳动能力的只是他的技术水平，因此评定等级只能根据技术等级标准。只有这样，才符合按劳付酬的原则，才能做到真正合理。
    社论说，评定工人的技术等级，一定要做好宣传教育工作。比如，有的工人互相比，认为要升级大家一起升，不升都不升；有的工人对按照技术等级标准评定工资有顾虑，怕降级、怕减工资。对这些有不正确认识和不必要顾虑的人，都需要及时地向他们进行解释。
    社论强调说，评定工人技术等级，要特别注意依靠和发动群众。在提名以前，领导方面应该充分吸收工人群众和管理干部的意见，在发动群众讨论的时候，要大胆放手，使群众能够无保留地倾吐自己的意见。最后定案的时候，还要充分考虑工人群众提出的意见，以便做到真正的合理，使大家都满意。
    社论最后提出，经过学习技术等级标准和合理地评定技术等级以后，工人群众学习文化技术和生产的积极性一定会更加提高，这就要求工厂领导方面及时采取措施，组织经常性的技术学习，使得这次升了级的工人进一步提高技术，达不到技术标准而被保留等级的工人也能够争取早日达到技术标准。同时，要建立起经常性的升级制度，使工人在技术提高以后能够及时地升级。这样做，就能够使工人群众的积极性经常保持和发扬，为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。
