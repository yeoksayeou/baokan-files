    The Past and Present of Romania's Oil Center
    Du Balaria, Member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party
    First Secretary of the Prahova Regional Committee
    Editor's Note: Today is the 12th anniversary of Romania's liberation, and we are publishing this article to celebrate.
    Prahova Region is located in southeastern Romania. It is situated at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, near the wide valleys of the Prahova and Teleajen Rivers. It is a crossroads of several important commercial highways. These conditions have promoted the development of its crafts and commerce. In the 19th century, due to the discovery of vast crude oil deposits, the Prahova River Valley became Romania's oil base. The city of Ploiești gradually became the center of this new industry. In 1856, Romania's first oil refinery was built in Ploiești, making Bucharest the first city in the world to be lit by kerosene. By 1928, fourteen more refineries had been built in Ploiești. Refineries also appeared in other cities in the region. This rapid development was due to the rapid growth of oil production. Therefore, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Prahova River Valley became the focus of attention for the most important foreign capital.
    In 1914, among all investments in the Romanian oil industry, British and Dutch capital accounted for 47.89%, German capital accounted for 27.37%, American capital accounted for 6.19%, French and Belgian capital accounted for 8.6%, and Italian capital accounted for 1.85%. Foreign capital totaled 91.9%, while Romanian capital accounted for only a small portion. The near-total monopoly of the Romanian oil industry by foreign capital subjected oil workers to increasing exploitation. The Romanian newspaper "Socialism" quoted a representative of the Prahova River Valley oil workers in 1919 as saying, "There are many villages that cannot even afford cornmeal porridge. Other slightly better villages only have cornmeal porridge and vinegar." Unable to endure the brutal plunder and exploitation of foreign capitalists, Romanian oil workers and the entire Romanian people waged a resolute struggle. The great strike of oil workers and railway workers in 1933 wrote a glorious page in the history of the Romanian working class's struggle against capitalist enslavement and for their own liberation.
    Since the liberation of Romania on August 23, 1944, the Romanian oil city of Ploiești is vastly different from the past. Although it is still a crossroads for many oil transportation routes. The old clock on the front wall of the building still tells the time; the sun still rises from the east as it did in the past, but the light it shines on is a completely different scene.
    The past situation where oil workers were squeezed into dark huts has changed. The government has built new houses for them. Newly planted shrubs and fruit trees line the roads. These trees block the gales that used to howl unrestrained here. The fresh fragrance of tender leaves constantly emanates from newly built parks and green squares. Nurseries and sanatoriums planted with colorful flowers have appeared on what was once a desolate land.
    In the past, oil workers extracted millions of tons of crude oil from underground at the risk of their lives, but they could not get enough oil to burn for fire and light. Now, they have gas stoves; there are also electric lights on the streets and in the houses. The gas network has been extended to more than thirty streets, making gas available to many homes, factories, enterprises, schools, and entertainment venues.
    Ploiești Region occupies a very important position in Romania's oil production. In 1955, Romania's national oil production reached more than 10.05 million tons, of which Ploiești Region accounted for a large part. In Romania's first Five-Year Plan, Ploiești's crude oil extraction plan was overfulfilled. Oil production in 1955 increased by more than 80% compared to 1951. Such a rate of growth was unimaginable in the past.
    The growth in crude oil production during the first Five-Year Plan was due to putting new oil fields into production and increasing the output of crude oil wells; at the same time, it was also due to learning the advanced working methods of Soviet oil workers. In the reconstruction and development of our oil industry, Soviet assistance has played a significant role. The chemical industry, which is closely related to oil, has also achieved important results in Ploiești Region. Its output last year increased by nearly double compared to 1950. To study and develop the use of oil in chemistry, Ploiești Region has established a specialized petrochemical research institute.
    Due to the measures taken by the People's Committee to develop the local economy and more fully utilize local resources, the output of Ploiești's local industry in 1955 increased by more than double compared to 1950. This has greatly helped to improve the supply of consumer goods to the working people.
    The proportion of socialist components in agriculture in Ploiești Region, as a percentage of cultivated land, has increased from 4% in 1950 to 17.2% in 1955. There has been further development in the first half of this year. This shows that many peasant masses have broken away from individual management and are beginning to advance along the path indicated by the Party. On a voluntary basis, more than ten collective farms, hundreds of joint farming cooperatives, and simple production mutual aid groups have been formed here. The state helps the working peasants through loans, agricultural tools, fertilizers, scientific and technological knowledge, and the demonstration of good management by state-owned farms. Due to the mechanization of agricultural cultivation and the adoption of advanced agricultural techniques, grain production has increased from 447,818 tons in 1950 to 649,514 tons in 1955.
    The material and cultural living standards of the working people in Ploiești Region are also constantly improving. From 1950 to 1955, the number of primary schools increased from 772 to 809, seven-year schools from 317 to 366, and ten-year schools from 16 to 23. In 1950, there was only one night school for workers, while now there are sixteen. A wide range of cultural organizations have been established in Ploiești Region. There are a total of 751 cultural clubs, 762 libraries, a national theater, nine historical museums, a music association, and three folk bands.
    The directives of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on the second Five-Year Plan foreshadow a new period of upsurge in industry, transportation, agriculture, trade, and the living standards of the working people. Ploiești Region, like our entire country, will further achieve even greater development.
    Romania is the only small country in the world that has rich oil resources and its own oil equipment industry. The enormous assistance of the Soviet Union can be demonstrated not only in the oil industry but also in all aspects of our country's economic life. Romania has not only been able to meet domestic needs for oil equipment but also has surplus products for export. A large part of this is shipped to the People's Republic of China. Most of our oil equipment factories, including the famous "May 1st" factory, are located in Ploiești Region. The workers, engineers, and technicians in these factories feel very happy that their equipment is shipped to China. During our country's first Five-Year Plan, deep-well drilling rigs of 1,200 meters, 2,500 meters, and 3,200 meters were exported to China. These machines are all affixed with the mark of the Ploiești "May 1st" factory. One of these machines has been used to drill the "Friendship Oil Well" in the Gobi Desert of China. Romanian workers and experts have been warmly welcomed in China like brothers, and Chinese oil workers are also welcomed by our oil workers here in the same way. The cooperation between our two countries' oil workers is part of the economic cooperation between our two countries. This cooperation will become closer and more effective day by day.

    罗马尼亚石油中心的今昔
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员
    普罗什蒂州委会第一书记  杜·巴拉里亚
    编者按：今天是罗马尼亚解放十二周年，我们特发表此文以示庆祝。
    普罗什蒂州在罗马尼亚的东南部。它位于喀尔巴阡山的山麓，普拉霍瓦河和特里阿然河的宽阔河谷的近旁。它是几条重要商业公路的交叉点。这些条件促进了它的工艺和商业的发展。在十九世纪，由于发现了巨大的原油矿床，普拉霍瓦河谷变成了罗马尼亚的石油基地。普罗什蒂城也随着逐渐变成了这个新的事业的中心。1856年，罗马尼亚第一个炼油厂在普罗什蒂城建立了，这使得布加勒斯特成为世界上第一个用煤油取亮的城市。到了1928年，在普罗什蒂又建立起来了十四个炼油厂。这个州的其他城市也出现了炼油厂。这种像雨后春笋似的发展是由于石油生产迅速增长的缘故。因此，在上世纪末和本世纪初，普拉霍瓦河谷变成了最重要的外国资本的注意中心。
    1914年，在罗马尼亚石油工业全部投资当中，英国和荷兰占47.89％，德国占27.37％，美国占6.19％，法国和比利时占8.6％，意大利占1.85％。外国资本总共占了91.9％，而罗马尼亚的资本仅占了很小一部分。罗马尼亚的石油工业几乎全部为外国资本垄断的情况使得石油工人受到愈来愈大的剥削。罗马尼亚报纸“社会主义报”在1919年引用普拉霍瓦河谷石油工人的一个代表的声明说：“有许多这样的乡村，连玉米粥都喝不上。其他一些稍好一点的村子只有玉米粥和醋”。由于不堪忍受外国资本家的残酷掠夺和剥削，罗马尼亚石油工人和全体罗马尼亚人民进行了坚决的斗争。1933年石油工人和铁路工人的大罢工，在罗马尼亚工人阶级反对资本主义奴役、争取自身解放的斗争历史上曾写下了光荣的一页。
    1944年8月23日罗马尼亚解放以后，罗马尼亚的石油城普罗什蒂和过去是大不相同了。虽然，它仍然是许多条运输石油公路的交叉点。在建筑物正面墙上的古老的时钟照旧在报着时刻；太阳也像过去一样从东方升起，然而，它的光芒所照射到的却完全是另一幅景象了。
    过去石油工人挤居在黝黑的小屋中的情况已改变了。政府为他们兴建了新的住宅。在道路旁排列着新植的灌木和果树。这些树木挡住了以往一直在这儿不受约束地呼号着的狂风。从新建的公园和绿色的广场中不断地散发出嫩叶的清香。在这里曾是一片荒凉的土地上，出现了种植着各色鲜花的托儿所和疗养院。
    在过去，冒着生命危险的石油工人从地下采掘出了成百万吨的原油，但他们却得不到足够的油来烧火和点灯。而现在，他们已有了煤气炉；在街上和屋里也有了电灯。煤气网已扩展到三十多条街道，因而使许多住宅、工厂、企业、学校以及文娱场所都用到了煤气。
    普罗什蒂州在罗马尼亚石油生产中占有很重要的地位。1955年罗马尼亚全国的石油产量达到一千零五十多万吨，其中普罗什蒂一个州就占了很大的一部分。在罗马尼亚的第一个五年计划中，普罗什蒂的原油开采计划已超额完成。1955年的石油产量比1951年增加了80％以上。这样的增长速度在从前是不可想像的。
    第一个五年计划期间原油产量的增长，是由于把新油矿投入了生产和提高了原油井的产量；同时，也由于学习了苏联石油工人的先进工作法。在重建和发展我们的石油工业中，苏联的援助是起了很大作用的。和石油有密切关系的化学工业，在普罗什蒂州也获得了重要的成就。它在去年的产量已比1950年的产量增加了近一倍。为了研究和发展石油在化学上的用途，普罗什蒂州已成立了一个专门的石油化学研究机构。
    由于人民委员会所采取的发展地方经济的措施和更充分地利用了当地的资源，1955年普罗什蒂地方工业的产量已比1950年增加了一倍多。这就大大有助于改善对劳动人民的消费品的供应。
    普罗什蒂州农业中的社会主义成分在耕地中所占的比重，已经由1950年的4％增加到1955年的17.2％。今年上半年内还有进一步的发展。这说明许多农民群众已经脱离了个体经营的行列，开始沿着党所指示的道路前进着。在自愿的基础上，这里已经组成了十多个集体农庄，几百个联合耕种社和简单的生产互助组。国家通过贷款、农具、肥料、科学技术知识和国营农场良好经营的示范等等办法来帮助劳动农民。由于农业耕作的机械化和采用了先进的农业技术，已使得谷物产量从1950年的四十四万七千八百十八吨增加到1955年的六十四万九千五百十四吨。
    普罗什蒂州劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平也不断提高。从1950年到1955年，初级学校的数字已由七百七十二所增加到八百零九所，七年制学校由三百十七所增加到三百六十六所，十年制学校由十六所增加到二十三所。1950年只有一所在业工人的夜校，而现在共有十六所。普罗什蒂州里已经建立了广泛的和各种各样的文化组织。这里共有七百五十一个文化俱乐部，七百六十二个图书馆，一个国家剧院，九个历史博物馆，一个音乐协会和三个民间乐队。
    罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会关于第二个五年计划的指示，预示着在工业、运输业、农业、贸易和劳动人民的生活水平方面将要出现一个新的高涨时期。普罗什蒂州正像我们整个国家一样，也将进一步获得更巨大的发展。
    罗马尼亚是世界上唯一具有丰富的石油资源并有自己的采油装备工业的小国。苏联的巨大援助不仅在石油工业方面，在我国经济生活的各个方面都可得到证明。罗马尼亚不仅已能满足国内石油装备方面的需要，而且也有剩余产品出口。在这方面有很大一部分是被运往中华人民共和国的。我国大部分的采油装备工厂，包括著名的“五一”工厂都建立在普罗什蒂州，这些工厂里的工人们、工程师和技术人员们由于自己的装备运往中国而感到满心喜悦。在我国第一个五年计划期间，曾向中国输出了一千二百公尺、二千五百公尺和三千二百公尺的深井钻探机。这些机器上都附着普罗什蒂“五一”工厂的标志。其中有一架机器已用来钻探中国戈壁大沙漠上的“友谊油井”。罗马尼亚工人和专家在中国受到了情如兄弟的欢迎，中国的石油工人们在这里也受到我国石油工人们同样的欢迎。我们两国石油工人间的合作，是我们两国间经济合作的一部分。这种合作将一天天地更加紧密并且获得成效。
