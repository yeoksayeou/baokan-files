    A committee of the Church of Scotland, in its report, described the atrocities of the British colonialists in Kenya. The report said that one million Africans were confined within the wire-fenced "new villages" of the Kenyan government. Life in the "new villages" was worse than in prisons, and many children suffered from chronic malnutrition. Many adults also starved to death. The "new villages" were mostly populated by women carrying children. They were forced to perform forced labor for five days a week. The committee randomly selected seven huts in a village for investigation and found that these seven huts were inhabited by an average of three and a half families, or fifteen people, per hut.

    凄惨的“新村”
    苏格兰教会的一个委员会在它的报告里，叙述了英国殖民者在怯尼亚的暴行。这个报告说，一百万名非洲人被圈禁在怯尼亚政府用铁丝网围绕的“新村”内。“新村”的生活比监狱还惨，许多小孩都患了慢性营养不良症。成年人饿死的也不少。“新村”里居民以携带小孩的妇女为最多。她们每周被迫从事强迫劳动五日。委员会在一个村庄里，任意选择了七个茅舍进行调查，发现这七个茅舍，平均每舍住着三户半人家、十五个人。
