Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: The Soviet National Games grandly opened in Moscow at 1:00 PM today.

    The newly built Lenin Central Stadium was filled with a joyous atmosphere today. More than one hundred thousand people came to the large stadium from several roads and across the Moscow River. Long before the opening ceremony, the main competition field was packed with people.

    When the leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union walked onto the central rostrum, the audience erupted in warm applause. Military music filled the stadium, and the Soviet national flag was raised. This was followed by a review parade. Athletes from the fifteen union republics, dressed in national costumes and carrying flags, marched across the stadium.

    Subsequently, more than eight thousand gymnasts from primary and secondary school students, labor reserve schools, the Central Institute of Physical Education, and trade unions performed gymnastics, artistic performances, and dances on the stadium. Their performances were rich, varied, and won warm applause from the audience.

    Athletes from the All-Union Star Relay Race ran into the stadium, having traveled to Moscow along eight routes from all over the country. The longest route was seven thousand five hundred kilometers, and the shortest was nine hundred and eighty kilometers.

    Athletes from the All-Union Cycling Competition also ran into the stadium. The entire competition covered two thousand six hundred and sixty-two kilometers. The athletes started from Moscow and returned to Moscow via Kharkov, Kyiv, Minsk, and other places. Moscow athletes won first place.

    Then the track and field events began. The first event was the 10,000-meter race, in which the famous Soviet athlete Kuts broke the Soviet national record with a time of 28 minutes 57.8 seconds. Subsequently, the 3,200-meter men's relay race and the 2,400-meter women's relay race were held.

    At 5:00 PM, a soccer match began in the stadium.

    The Soviet National Games is the largest event in the history of Soviet sports. More than nine thousand outstanding athletes, who were selected through multiple rounds to form the delegations of each union republic, are participating in this sports event. This is more than the largest of all previous international games - the participants of the 15th Olympic Games, because only seven thousand athletes from various countries participated in this international games.

    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联各民族运动大会今天下午一时在莫斯科开幕。
    在最近建成的列宁中央运动场上，今天充满着欢乐的气氛。十多万人群从几条道路和莫斯科河上来到大运动场。离开幕前很久，大比赛场就坐满了人。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人走上中央看台时，观众响起了热烈的掌声。场上响起了军乐声，升起了苏联国旗。接着举行检阅式。十五个加盟共和国的运动员穿着民族服装，举着旗帜，走过了运动场。
    随后，中小学生、劳动后备学校、中央体育学院和工会的八千多名体操队员在运动场上表演了体操、艺术表演和舞蹈。他们的表演丰富多采，变化多端，博得了观众的热烈欢迎。
    全苏星状接力赛的运动员跑到运动场上，他们是从全国各地沿着八条道路跑到莫斯科来的。最长的路程有七千五百公里，最近的也有九百八十公里。
    全苏自行车比赛的运动员们也跑到运动场上来了。比赛的全程共有二千六百六十二公里。运动员们是从莫斯科出发经哈尔科夫、基辅、明斯克等地又回到莫斯科的。莫斯科运动员得到了第一名。
    接着田径赛开始了。第一个项目是一万公尺赛跑，苏联著名运动员库茨以二十八分五十七秒八的成绩打破了苏联全国纪录。随后，举行了三千二百公尺男子接力赛和二千四百公尺的女子接力赛。

    苏联各民族运动大会是苏联运动史上规模最大的一次。参加这次运动大会的有通过多次选拔后组成各加盟共和国代表队的九千多名优秀的运动员。这比历届国际运动会中最大的一次——第十五届奥林匹克运动会的参加者还要多，因为参加这届国际运动会的只有七千名各国运动员。这次运动大会将成为具有高度水平的苏联体育运动的盛大检阅。
