    Reminiscences of "Little Painter"
    Li Jinhui
    From 1912 to 1940—nearly thirty years of manuscripts and notes, all destroyed in the flames of war. Everything from the past must now be searched from vague memories, and only through the supplement of friends can a brief account be recorded.
    In 1924, the Shanghai National Language Training School Affiliated Elementary School implemented new teaching methods, emphasizing "developing children's individuality to cultivate their talents." At the same time, the "National Language Monthly" published a "Chinese Character Reform Issue." I participated in these two closely related activities. The following year, I wrote a lengthy article based on teaching achievements and submitted it to the "Elementary Education Monthly." The first half was mild, and the second half was intense. As a result, only the first half was published. Later, I wrote a satirical play "Principal," in which the principal was autocratic, suppressed children, and canceled drawing and music courses, replacing them with "Book of Classics," first reading "The Analects," which had to be recited fluently. As a result, a school with ten faculty members was left with only two students, who were the principal's two sons. This story was based on facts. However, it was not published or performed due to dissuasion from various parties. At that time, some parents were reluctant to abandon feudal ideas. New educational methods often aroused their opposition, especially the Chinese character reform movement, which once colluded with warlord ruling groups, almost causing the ridiculous situation of issuing an arrest warrant.
    In 1926, I and my colleagues from the Bright Moon Society watched a performance by a Russian émigré amateur theater troupe at the Paris Grand Theater in Shanghai. There was a farce satirizing "feudal family education suppressing the individuality of teenagers," which was very vivid with singing and dancing. Although we did not understand Russian, we were infected to a certain extent. I felt that adapting a small opera based on the outline of this farce for "indirect attack," avoiding head-on conflict, would be more effective and could be performed smoothly. So I "confined" myself in the Cangzhou Hotel and wrote "Little Painter."
    "Little Painter" is only a children's opera. It only interspersed a little dance and should not be called a song and dance drama. After publication, the mistake was allowed to stand, and no correction was made. It should be corrected now. After the script was written, I also wrote some fragmented "rehearsal plans," adopting a small part of the artistic images of the Russian émigré performance of that farce, for example, the forms of the three teachers and the movements of the "bowing dance" were indeed based on the above. The singing and music of the whole play were written according to children's forms and national style, and a small part of the folk music segments were also used. At the same time, there was also the intention of using the combination of music and language to play a role in promoting the national language movement.
    After the performance, it did not cause a head-on conflict. Children were happy to perform, and the masses were happy to watch and appreciate. Therefore, it has been circulating for many years. The initial performance of this play was entrusted to Li Ming (deceased) as the executive director, and it was also revised by the actors from time to time. In the performance process, we tried to avoid obvious low tastes and attempted to set an example for the performances of other song and dance groups. However, limited to my literary accomplishment and writing skills, this play obviously still has many shortcomings, such as some vulgar lyrics and some rough music elements, which must be revised.
    Now, under the correct leadership of the Party, this play can participate in the performance of the First National Music Week, so that it can invite the masses to criticize it in the "let a hundred flowers bloom." I sincerely hope that comrades who are enthusiastic about cultural undertakings will give criticism and guidance. At the same time, whether the children's opera form like "Little Painter" is still worth "bringing forth the new from the old" is also hoped that everyone will discuss. I am willing to study hard and write hard under the guidance of the Party and with the help of comrades to serve children's literature and art.

    回忆“小小画家”
    黎锦晖
    从1912到1940——接近三十年的稿件和笔记，全部毁于战火，过去的一切事儿，至今都得从模糊的记忆中去搜索，再通过朋友们的补充，才能记录出简要的情况。
    在1924年，上海国语专修学校附属小学实行新的教学法，重视“发挥儿童个性来培养其才能”，同时“国语月刊”编行“汉字改革号”，我参加了这两项有密切关系的活动。次年，曾根据教学成绩写了一篇长文投到“初等教育月刊”，前半篇温和，后半篇激烈，结果只登载了前半篇。后来写了一出讽刺剧“校长大人”，剧中的校长，独断校务，压制儿童；取消图画、音乐课程，改为“书经”，先读“论语”，必须背诵如流。结果，有十个教职员的学校，仅仅留下两个学生，而他们就是校长的两个儿子。这故事，是有事实根据的。但因被各方面劝阻，没获得发表和演出的机会。那时，一部分学生家长，还舍不得抛弃封建意识。新的教育方式经常引起他们的反对，尤其反对汉字改革运动，曾经勾结军阀统治集团，几乎闹出下令通缉的笑话。
    1926年我和明月社社友在上海巴黎大戏院观摩俄侨业余剧团演出，有一出讽刺“封建家庭教育压抑少年个性”的闹剧，载歌载舞，非常生动，我们虽不懂俄语，也得到一定程度的感染。我觉得根据这闹剧的轮廓编个小歌剧来进行“旁敲侧击”，避免正面冲突，比较有效而且可以顺利地演出，于是把自己“禁闭”在沧洲饭店中，写就了“小小画家。”
    “小小画家”只算是一部儿童歌剧，它仅仅穿插了一点儿舞蹈，不宜称为歌舞剧，出版后将错就错，未予更正，现在应该更正了。剧本编好后，还写了一些散碎的“排演方案”，采用了小部分俄侨演出那闹剧的艺术形象，例如：三个老师的形态和“俯仰舞”的动作，确是有上述的依据。全剧的歌腔与乐曲，是根据儿童曲式和民族风格写的，也采用了小部分民间曲中的乐段。同时，还有借着音乐同语言的结合来为宣传国语运动起一点作用的意图。
    演出后，果然没有引起正面冲突；儿童也高兴表演，群众也高兴看赏，因此，流传了多年。这剧初次演出，是委托黎明（已故）为执行导演，也曾经过演员们随时修改。在表演过程中，力求避免显著的低级趣味，企图作出其它歌舞团体表演的榜样。但是，这剧限于我的文艺修养和写作技巧上的水平，显然还有不少的缺点，如歌词有些庸俗和音乐有些粗糙的成分，必须加以修改。
    现在，在党的正确领导下，这剧得参加第一届全国音乐周的演出，使它在“百花齐放”中能邀取群众批判的机会。我衷心希望热心文化事业的同志，予以批评和指教。同时，如“小小画家”这样的儿童歌剧形式，现在是否还值得“推陈出新”，也希望大家研讨。我愿在党的指导下、同志们的帮助下，努力学习，努力写作，来为儿童文艺服务。
