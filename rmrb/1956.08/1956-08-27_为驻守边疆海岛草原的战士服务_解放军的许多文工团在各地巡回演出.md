Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. Many performing arts troupes and performance teams of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are touring and performing in border areas, islands, and grasslands. Their performances are loved by the vast number of officers and soldiers.

    When the Performing Arts Troupe of the Political Department of the Public Security Army performed for the troops stationed in a certain area of the Yunnan border, many people in the audience couldn't help but dance along with the performers on stage during "Agenbai" and "Ukrainian Dance". When the Suona in "Folk Instrument Performance" "laughed," the audience laughed even louder. After the evening party, the soldiers presented the actors with bunches of "canna" and "butterfly orchids" before reluctantly leaving the venue. When the amateur performing arts team of the Jilin Military Region came to a certain unit stationed on the grassland, the barracks was filled with joy. Their performances, such as "Welcome New Soldiers," faithfully reflected the lives of the soldiers and won the praise of the audience. Most of the programs had to take bows six or seven times. The members of the Performing Arts Troupe of the Political Department of the Air Force, upon arriving at a certain unit, started chatting warmly with the soldiers as soon as they put down their backpacks. In the evenings, they performed, and during the day, they enthusiastically tutored the singing groups, dance groups, and instrumental groups formed by officers and soldiers of various units. Some members even helped the soldiers learn vocalization and instruments during their lunch break. The officers and soldiers stationed on a certain island in Liaodong expressed after watching the wonderful folk art programs performed by the Shenyang Troops Performing Arts Troupe that they would make greater achievements in national defense construction to thank the care of the superiors.

    为驻守边疆海岛草原的战士服务
    解放军的许多文工团在各地巡回演出
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军的许多文工团和演出队，正在边疆、海岛和草原进行巡回演出。他们演出的节目受到了广大官兵的喜爱。
    公安军政治部文工团在云南边疆某地驻军中演出时，台上在演“阿根拜”和“乌克兰舞”，台下许多人也不由得手舞足蹈起来；“民间乐器演奏”中的琐呐在“笑”的时候，观众比它笑得更欢。晚会结束后，战士们给演员献上了一束束的“美人蕉”、“蝴蝶兰”，才依依不舍地离开会场。吉林军区军人业余演出队来到驻在草原上的某部时，营房里一片欢腾。他们演出的“欢迎新战士”等节目忠实地反映了战士的生活，博得观众们的赞赏，大部分节目都要谢幕六、七次。空军政治部文工团的团员们到了某部队，刚放下背包就和战士们亲热地交谈起来。他们晚上演出，白天还分别到各部队官兵组成的演唱组、舞蹈组、乐器组去热情地进行辅导，有些团员还在午睡时间帮助战士学习发声和乐器。驻守在辽东某海岛部队的官兵们，在沈阳部队文工团演出精采的曲艺节目以后纷纷表示，要在国防建设中做出更大的成绩来答谢上级首长的关怀。
