Qianshan County Exhibits Local Specialties
Opening Up Sideline Production Opportunities for Farmers

(Our Hefei Dispatch) Qianshan County, Anhui Province, is using surveys and exhibitions of local specialties to open up avenues for sideline production for farmers. The Qianshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, with the cooperation of relevant departments, recently conducted a preliminary survey of small local products and wild plants throughout the county, discovering 123 new varieties. These include industrial raw materials such as cork, mountain cotton bark, and *lianpi*, as well as valuable medicinal materials such as musk, rock tripe, and *fuling*. Currently, 20 varieties have already begun to be purchased, and others will also be available for purchase after inspection. The Yujing District of Qianshan County also recently exhibited more than 960 kinds of local specialties. After viewing these exhibits, cadres from various townships discovered many business opportunities. Baizhai Township originally produced a lot of medicinal materials, but in the past they were always considered useless. At the exhibition, after seeing the 65 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials on display and comparing them with the products produced in their own township, they found that 61 kinds were the same. In the past, the economic departments did not have a good understanding of sideline products and could not provide good support. Now, after understanding the situation through the exhibition, the county Supply and Marketing Cooperative and local agricultural cooperatives have signed 52 contracts, and the county Purchasing Bureau has also signed 10 contracts for the purchase of hides and feathers. The agricultural cooperatives throughout the district received a great education from this exhibition. The large-scale sideline industries collectively operated have expanded from the original 80 kinds to 114 kinds.

    潜山县展览土特产品
    为农民开辟副业生产门路
    本报合肥电　安徽省潜山县用调查和展览土特产品的办法，为农民开辟副业生产门路。潜山县供销社，最近在有关部门配合下，对全县小土产和野生植物进行了初步调查，发现一百二十三种新的品种。其中有栓皮、山棉皮、连皮等工业原料，有麝香、石耳、茯苓等贵重药材。现在有二十种已开始收购，其他经过检定也将可开始收购。潜山县余井区并于最近展览了九百六十多种土特产品。各乡干部看了这些展览品后，发现了许多经营门路，白寨乡过去本来就生产很多药材，可是过去一直认为是没有用的东西；在展览会上看到展览的六十五种中药材，和本乡生产的东西一对照，竟有六十一种是相同的。过去经济部门对副业产品不摸底，不能很好扶持，现在通过展览了解情况以后，县供销社和各地农业社订了五十二个合同，县采购局也签订了十个收购兽皮和羽毛的合同。全区农业社从这次展览会上受到很大教育，集体经营的大型副业，由原来的八十种扩大到一百一十四种。
