    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 25th: TASS reports from Helsinki that Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, who is currently visiting Finland, answered questions posed by Mrs. Snellman, a Finnish correspondent for the Associated Press, regarding Soviet-Finnish relations and peaceful coexistence.

    Voroshilov said that Soviet-Finnish relations in the political, economic, and cultural spheres are developing smoothly in accordance with the interests of both peoples. It can be boldly said that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland is a good example of how countries with different socio-economic systems should arrange their relations. This relationship has triumphantly stood the test throughout the postwar era.

    Regarding the prospects of Soviet-Finnish relations, he said that there is every reason to believe that there are currently excellent conditions to prevent anything from affecting the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland and from hindering the further strengthening and development of these relations.

    Voroshilov said that the Soviet government is determined to work hard to continuously consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries, and that he has personally experienced during his visit to Finland that Finland is resolutely willing to continue advancing along the road of developing friendly ties with the Soviet Union.

    Voroshilov pointed out that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland have played a positive role in easing international tensions, especially in easing the situation in the Baltic Sea region, and have promoted the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Northern Europe.

    He said that the Finnish government's pursuit of an independent foreign policy and the maintenance of friendly relations with all countries are primarily in line with its own national interests, and also have a good influence on those countries that are willing to stay out of the contradictions between major powers.

    When talking about the significance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in today's international situation, Voroshilov said that the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the foundation of relations between many countries in Europe and Asia, and these principles have recently been embraced by more and more people around the world.

    He said that the adoption of the above five principles in the relations between all countries would be of extremely great significance. In the current international situation, these principles are the best way for countries with different social systems to get along. They can become the foundation for consolidating peaceful relations between countries.

    伏罗希洛夫在赫尔辛基向美记者指出
    苏芬友好关系将日益加强和发展
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基25日讯：正在芬兰访问的苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫答复了美联社驻芬兰记者斯内曼夫人所提出的关于苏芬关系及和平共处等方面的问题。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联和芬兰的政治、经济、文化各方面的关系都在按照两国人民的利益顺利地发展。可以大胆地说，苏联和芬兰之间的关系，是社会经济制度不同的国家之间应当如何安排彼此间的关系的良好范例。这种关系在整个战后年代里一直胜利地通过了考验。
    至于苏芬关系的前景，他说，人们有一切理由可以认为，目前有很好的条件不让任何东西来影响苏芬之间的友好关系和阻止这种关系的进一步加强和发展。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联政府决心努力使两国的友好关系不断巩固，而他在访问芬兰期间亲身体会到，芬兰坚决地愿意继续沿着同苏联发展友好联系的道路前进。
    伏罗希洛夫指出，苏联和芬兰之间的友好关系在缓和国际紧张局势方面，尤其是在缓和波罗的海地区的局势方面，起了积极的作用，并且促使苏联和北欧之间的关系获得改善。
    他说，芬兰政府执行独立的外交政策并且同一切国家保持友好关系，这首先是符合它自己的民族利益的，同时也对那些愿意置身于大国矛盾之外的国家发生了良好的影响。
    在谈到和平共处五项原则在今天的国际局势中的意义的时候，伏罗希洛夫说，著名的和平共处五项原则已经成了欧洲和亚洲许多国家之间的关系的基础，这些原则最近在全世界各地受到了越来越多的人的拥护。
    他说，在所有国家之间的关系中采用上述五项原则，将会有极其巨大的意义。在当前的国际局势中，这些原则是社会制度不同的各国相处的最好方式。它们能够成为各国之间巩固的和平关系的基础。
