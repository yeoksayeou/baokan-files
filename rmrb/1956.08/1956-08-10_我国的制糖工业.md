    China's Sugar Industry

    The year 1952 witnessed the highest sugar output in China. This year, the nation's sugar production is projected to double that of 1952.

    China boasts excellent conditions for cultivating sugar crops, ranking among the few countries globally capable of large-scale sugarcane and sugar beet production. Besides Taiwan, the well-known sugar-producing region, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, Sichuan, and other provinces are well-suited for sugarcane cultivation. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and other areas are ideal regions for sugar beet cultivation. Historical records indicate that sugarcane cultivation and sugar production in Guangdong Province can be traced back over 1,300 years to the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty. However, in the nearly one hundred years before liberation, China's sugar industry remained underdeveloped, consistently serving as a market for imported white sugar.

    Since liberation, the People's Government has renovated and constructed twelve large-scale mechanized sugar factories with an annual sugar production capacity exceeding 20,000 tons. An additional ten sugar factories of even larger scale are under construction. Among them, the Guangdong Beijie Sugar Factory, with a designed capacity of over 70,000 tons of sugar per year, will become China's largest sugar factory upon completion. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which historically lacked a sugar industry, is also preparing to build a mechanized sugar factory with an annual production capacity of 24,000 tons. Mechanized sugar production is projected to account for approximately 60% of the nation's planned sugar output this year.

    In developing the sugar industry, the local industries of relevant provinces have demonstrated significant initiative. Guangdong Province had only sixteen local state-owned sugar factories in 1953, but this number has increased to forty-eight this year; annual sugar production will increase more than fivefold compared to 1953. Investment in the sugar industry in Fujian Province this year accounts for 29% of the province's total investment in local industry. Overseas Chinese are also enthusiastically investing in and participating in the construction of the sugar industry. The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory, with an annual production capacity of 45,000 tons, and the Xianyou Sugar Factory, the largest in Fujian Province, currently under construction, are entirely funded by overseas Chinese investment.

    To further satisfy the growing demand for sugar, the state will construct new sugar factories and increase the number of machine factories specializing in the manufacture of sugar factory equipment. Three sugar industry experimental research institutions in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan, specializing in the research of new sugar industry technologies, have already been established this year. Specialized schools for training engineers and technicians for new sugar factories will also be established. To select, breed, and promote improved varieties of sugar crops, the state has established sugarcane and sugar beet experimental farms and sugarcane propagation farms in Guangdong and Inner Mongolia, respectively. In the future, plans are in place to continue building such experimental farms in sugar-producing regions such as Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, and Heilongjiang.

### 我国的制糖工业

    我国的制糖工业
    1952年是我国食糖产量最高的一年。今年全国食糖产量将达到1952年的两倍。
    我国具有种植糖料作物的优越条件，是世界上少有的甘蔗和甜菜都能大量生产的国家之一。除了著名的产糖区台湾以外，广东、广西、云南、福建、四川等省，都适宜种植甘蔗；黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、新疆、甘肃等地，是良好的甜菜种植区域。据可考查的史实，在一千三百多年前的唐代贞观年间，我国广东省就已经开始种蔗制糖。但是，在解放以前的近百年中，我国制糖工业却很落后，一直是外国白糖倾销的市场。
    解放以后，人民政府改建和新建成了十二个年产食糖两万吨以上的大型机制糖厂，正在兴建的另外十个糖厂规模更大。其中，广东北街糖厂设计能力为年产七万多吨食糖，投入生产后将是我国最大的糖厂。历史上从来没有制糖工业的新疆维吾尔自治区，也正在筹建一个年产两万四千吨的机制糖厂。今年全国食糖计划产量中，机制糖约占60％。
    在发展制糖工业中，有关各省的地方工业发挥了很大的积极性。广东省在1953年只有十六个地方国营糖厂，今年已经发展到四十八个；食糖年产量将比1953年增长五倍多。福建省今年制糖工业的投资占全省地方工业投资的29％。海外华侨也热心投资参加制糖工业的建设。正在建设中的年产量四万五千吨的广东华侨糖厂和福建省最大的仙游糖厂，全部都是华侨投资的。
    为了进一步满足日益增长的食糖需要，国家还将建设新的糖厂，并且准备增加专门制造糖厂设备的机器工厂。专门研究制糖工业新技术的广东、黑龙江、四川三个制糖工业试验研究机构，已经在今年成立。为新糖厂培养工程师和技工的专门学校，也将建立。为了选育和推广糖料良种，国家已经分别在广东、内蒙古地区建立了甘蔗、甜菜试验场和甘蔗繁殖场。今后还准备在广西、云南、福建和黑龙江等产糖地区继续增建这种试验场。
