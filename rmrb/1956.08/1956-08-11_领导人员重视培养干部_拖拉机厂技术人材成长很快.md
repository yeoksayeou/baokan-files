Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 9th. As of the end of July, the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant had increased its engineering and technical personnel in various fields such as machinery manufacturing, motor manufacturing, metal cutting, metallurgy, casting, and civil construction to more than 580 people, more than double the number in the same period last year. This is equivalent to more than 60% of the technical strength required when the plant goes into production in the future.

Since the establishment of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, the leading cadres of the plant have attached great importance to the work of cultivating technical strength. They have established a system for training and managing technical cadres. Since the beginning of this year, they have organized professional and technical studies for engineering and technical personnel in a planned and leadership-led manner, and held various professional and technical training classes. The young technical cadres in the factory have also formulated personal study plans to reach the level of engineers within three to five years, and they teach and learn from each other in their practical work. Therefore, the level of these technical cadres has been improved rapidly. For example, the efficiency of technical personnel Cui Fan in reviewing drawings has increased by two times compared to the time he entered the factory. Chen Dejian became familiar with the names, positions, performance and characteristics of more than 300 parts on the engine within half a year, and has been rated as an advanced worker.

Because the working ability of many technical personnel has been improved, most of the engineers and technicians in this factory will be promoted this year. Of the students who were assigned to the factory by the state last year from universities and secondary technical schools, 261 have been transferred to technicians or assistant technicians after more than half a year of practical work.

    领导人员重视培养干部
    拖拉机厂技术人材成长很快
    新华社洛阳9日电　到七月底止，第一拖拉机制造厂在机械制造、电机制造、金属切削、冶金、铸造、土木建筑等各方面的工程技术人员，已经增加到五百八十多人，比去年同期增加了一倍多，相当于这个厂将来投入生产时所需要的技术力量的60％以上。
    第一拖拉机制造厂自从建厂以来，厂的领导干部就很重视培养技术力量的工作。他们建立了培养、管理技术干部的制度；从今年年初以来，又有计划、有领导地组织了工程技术人员的业务学习，举办了各种专业技术进修班。厂内的青年技术干部，也都制定了在三年到五年内要达到工程师水平的个人学习规划，并且在实际工作中互教互学。因此，这些技术干部的水平，都提高得很快。例如技术人员崔凡审查图纸的效率，已经比进厂时期提高了两倍。陈德鉴在半年内，就熟悉了发动机上三百多个零件的名称、位置、性能和特点，已被评为先进工作者。
    因为许多技术人员的工作能力已经提高，今年这个厂的大部分工程师和技术员都将升级。去年由国家统一分配来厂的大学和中等技术学校毕业的学生，经过半年多实际工作的锻炼，现在已有二百六十一人转为技术员或助理技术员。
