    巴基斯坦全国庆祝独立九周年
    阿里总理发表演说主张和平解决苏彝士运河问题
    据新华社喀喇蚩15日电　喀喇蚩和巴基斯坦各地人民在八月十四日庆祝巴基斯坦独立九周年。
    巴基斯坦总理阿里十四日下午在喀喇蚩主持了升旗仪式，随后在庆祝集会上发表了演说。
    阿里总理在集会上说，巴基斯坦正在努力谋求和平解决苏彝士运河争端。他希望能找到一种合宜的解决办法，既保持埃及对于运河的主权，同时也保证苏彝士运河的自由航行。
    他还说，苏彝士运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分，埃及对它有完全的主权。埃及有权把苏彝士运河收归国有。
    听众好几次打断了阿里总理的演说，并且高呼：“纳赛尔万岁”、“苏彝士运河是埃及的”、“巴基斯坦应该支持埃及”等口号。
