Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 12th: The repatriated overseas Chinese and refugees who recently returned from Thailand are being properly resettled one after another.

    At present, the vast majority of refugees have returned to their ancestral homes and reunited with their families. Some refugees who requested employment and had no relatives to rely on have been sent by relevant authorities to the Taishan County Overseas Chinese Study Class for job training, or introduced to the state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island to participate in tropical crop cultivation, according to their wishes and abilities. Whether these returning overseas Chinese return to their hometowns or find employment, the government provides all travel, accommodation, and food expenses along the way. Those with individual financial difficulties also receive appropriate living subsidies and relief. Tu Lianfang, a refugee family member suffering from severe heart disease, relapsed on the ship on the way back to China. After landing, the Shantou City Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau immediately sent her to the hospital for free treatment.

    泰国归侨得到妥善安置
    新华社广州12日电　最近由泰国归来的难侨和归侨们正陆续得到妥善的安置。
    目前，绝大部分难侨已经返回原籍和家人团聚；部分要求就业和无亲可投的难侨，已由有关机关根据他们的志愿和能力，分别送往台山县华侨学习班给予就业训练，或介绍到海南岛国营兴隆华侨农场，参加热带作物的垦植。这些回国的华侨不论回乡或就业，沿途舟车食宿费用，都全部由政府供给，个别生活有困难的，还得到适当的生活补助和救济。一位患有严重心脏病的难侨家属涂莲芳，在回国途中的船上旧病复发，登岸后便立即由汕头市侨务局送她到医院免费治疗。
