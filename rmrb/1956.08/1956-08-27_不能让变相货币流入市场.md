    Cannot Allow De Facto Currency to Flow into the Market

    Eleven agricultural cooperatives in Pei County and Feng County, Jiangsu Province, including Dengta (Lighthouse), Xingguang (Starlight), and Shengguang (Rising Light), arbitrarily issued over 14,000 yuan of "coupons" and "tickets" acting as currency in May and June. The denominations on the tickets were one fen, one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao, etc.

    These "coupons" and "tickets" were issued by the agricultural cooperatives to replace cash when purchasing fodder and vegetables from their members. In reality, these "coupons" and "tickets" have already entered the market, and have caused the prices of some commodities to rise. For example, a pack of Hongqi (Red Flag) cigarettes in Pei County originally cost 1 jiao 1 fen, but when purchased with the cooperative's circulating coupons, it costs 1 jiao 3 fen a pack.

    Rural cadres and the masses do not understand the state's financial policies, which is why the problem of printing de facto currency and allowing it to flow into the market has occurred. They should not be overly blamed for this. The main reason is that the leading organs lacked comprehensive publicity and education beforehand, and did not stop it afterwards. For example, the Shengguang Agricultural Cooperative in Shunhe District, Feng County, consulted the district committee before printing circulating coupons. The district committee not only failed to consider the consequences of printing circulating coupons, but also introduced it as an experience at a meeting of district and township cadres.

    The "coupons" and "tickets" issued by these agricultural cooperatives have already caused market chaos, which is very harmful to the country and the people. The state's planned issuance of currency aims to control prices and invigorate commodity circulation. Therefore, these "coupons" and "tickets" that have already flowed into the market should be quickly withdrawn.

    不能让变相货币流入市场
    江苏省沛县和丰县的灯塔、星光、升光等十一个农业社，在五、六月份擅自发行了代货币的“券”“票”共一万四千多元，票面有一分、一角、二角、五角等。
    这些“券”“票”是农业社在购买社员草料、蔬菜时代替现款而印发的，实际上，这些“券”“票”已经流入市场，并且引起某些商品价格上涨。如沛县的红旗香烟原价一角一分一盒，用社的流通券购买就要一角三分钱一盒。
    农村干部和群众对国家金融政策不了解，因此发生了印制变相货币流入市场的问题，这不能过多地指责他们。主要的是领导机关事先缺乏全面的宣传教育，事后又不加制止。如丰县顺河区升光农业社在印发流通券前曾请示区委，区委不仅没有考虑到印发流通券会造成的后果，反而在区、乡干部会议上把它作为经验介绍。
    这些农业社印发的“券”“票”，已经引起了市场混乱，对国家对人民的危害是很大的。国家有计划的发行货币，目的在于控制物价，活跃商品流通。因此，这些已经流入市场的“券”“票”，应该迅速收回。
