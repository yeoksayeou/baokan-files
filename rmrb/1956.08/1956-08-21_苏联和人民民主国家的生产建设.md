    Soviet Union Accelerates Grain Harvesting in Various Regions
    (Our Moscow dispatch, August 20) The harvest is good everywhere in the Soviet Union, and harvesting work is in full swing. By mid-August, collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union had harvested nearly 50 million hectares of grain. Among the state farms, those in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) harvested the most, with 3.5 million hectares, followed by the state farms in Kazakhstan, which harvested 2.4 million hectares. The harvesting work in several thousand southern collective farms has been successively completed. Many collective farms and state farms there have harvested an average of 20 to 30 quintals of grain per hectare, and individual collective farms have even harvested 43 quintals.
    Collective farm members in Siberia and Kazakhstan are engaged in a heated competition. Soviet newspapers have been publishing new records of harvesting experts in recent days, such as combine operator Ivan Triguli from the Novosibirsk region, who harvested 400 hectares of grain in a short period using sectional harvesting methods. He continues to raise his quota every day, harvesting the grain from 70 hectares of land on August 13th alone. Currently, collective farms in Kazakhstan are ahead of those in Siberia, and collective farm members in Siberia are speeding up their efforts to catch up. In the Volga River region, nearly half of the grain has been harvested. From August 10th to 15th, a total of more than 1.22 million hectares were harvested, more than half as fast again as the previous five days.
    In the Central Black Earth Region, the Voronezh Oblast has the fastest harvesting speed, with farms in this region having harvested more than half of their crops.
    The harvesting of maize has also begun in Central Asia and Transcaucasia.
  Czechoslovakia Completes First Half Industrial Production Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 20th: The Czechoslovak State Statistical Office recently published a communique on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first half of 1956, stating that the total industrial output value plan for the first half of the year was completed by 102%, and industrial production increased by more than 10% compared to the first half of last year. Among them, coal production reached 33.8 million tons; electricity reached 8 billion kilowatt-hours; pig iron reached 1.6 million tons; and steel reached 2.4 million tons. In addition, iron ore increased by 25%, motorcycles increased by 25%, and radios increased by about 100%.
    In agriculture, the production situation in animal husbandry is generally good. Compared with the first half of last year, the purchase of edible livestock increased by 16%, and the purchase of milk increased by 15%.
    As of July 1, the number of advanced-type unified agricultural cooperatives nationwide had increased to 7,832, of which 1,037 cooperatives were established since the beginning of this year. These cooperatives now cultivate 2.2 million hectares of land, which is equivalent to 36% of the land area owned by individual farmers and other types of cooperatives.
    Railway freight volume increased by 9% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year.
    In the first half of this year, the national population increased by 66,000 people, reaching 13,223,000.
    Bulgaria's Shipbuilding Industry is Developing Rapidly
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 16th: Sofia News: Bulgaria's youngest industrial sector, shipbuilding, is developing rapidly.
    In the past five years, the Dimitrov Shipyard, the largest shipbuilding enterprise in the country, has manufactured more than 150 ships with a load capacity of 1,000 tons each for domestic waterway transportation and export.
    The shipyard has recently begun manufacturing barges with a load capacity of 3,000 tons and cargo ships with a load capacity of 3,000 to 5,000 tons. Two passenger ships with 250 cabins each will soon be built.
    It is expected that the total number of ships built will double in the next five years.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生产建设
    苏联各地加速收割谷物
    本报莫斯科20日电　苏联到处的收成都很好，收获工作正全面展开。到八月中旬，全苏联各集体农庄和国营农场已经收割了将近五千万公顷谷物。国营农场中，以俄罗斯联邦共和国的国营农场收割量最多，他们收割了三百五十万公顷，哈萨克斯坦的国营农场收割量占第二位，收割了二百四十万公顷。几千个南方的集体农庄收割工作已经陆续结束。那里的许多集体农庄和国营农场平均从每公顷土地上收获了二十到三十公担谷物，个别集体农庄甚至收获了四十三公担。
    西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦集体农庄庄员正在彼此展开热烈的竞赛，苏联各报上连日刊登了许多收割能手的新纪录，如诺沃西比尔斯克区收割机手伊万特里古利，在很短的时间内利用分段收割法收割了四百公顷粮食，他每天还在不断提高定额，八月十三日一天收割了七十公顷土地的粮食。现在哈萨克斯坦的集体农庄比西伯利亚农庄占先，西伯利亚集体农庄庄员们正在加快速度赶上前去。伏尔加河流域地区收割了差不多一半粮食。从八月十日到十五日一共收割了一百二十二万多公顷，比前五天快了半倍多。
    中央黑土地带以沃龙?什区收割速度最快，这个区的农庄已经收割了一多半庄稼。
    在中亚细亚和外高加索地区目前也开始了玉蜀黍的收割工作。
