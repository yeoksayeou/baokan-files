Xinhua News Agency, Sansha Town, 4th: The important fishing port of Sansha Town in northeastern Fujian Province suffered no loss of life or property during the typhoon attack. From the 1st to 8:00 AM on the 2nd, the fishing port was hit by a strong typhoon with winds of force 8 to 10.

Before the typhoon arrived, the whole town had taken emergency defensive measures. All of the town's more than 400 local and foreign fishing boats and civilian vessels had been driven into the typhoon shelter or pulled ashore. The members of the town's emergency rescue team and ambulance team patrolled in the wind and rain. Many fishermen calmly repaired their boats and nets at home, preparing to welcome the autumn fishing season.

The fishing port was hit by the typhoon for a total of thirty hours, but because the defense work was done well, the people's lives and property were not lost. Local cadres and fishermen even rescued a 40-ton fishing boat anchored in the port at noon on the 1st, when the wind and waves were high.

    三沙镇防御工作做得好
    台风袭击三十小时没有受损失
    据新华社三沙镇4日电　福建省东北部的重要渔港——三沙镇，在台风袭击中人民的生命和财产没有遭受损失。这个渔港从一日到二日八时止，受到了风力达八级到十级的强台风的袭击。
    在台风来到这里以前，全镇就采取了紧急防御措施。全镇四百多条本地的和外来的渔船、民船，已全部驶进避风港或拉上岸来。镇上的抢险队和救护队的队员冒着风雨巡逻，不少的渔民平静地在家里修船补网，准备迎接秋季大鱼汛。
    这个渔港遭受台风袭击的时间共达三十个小时，但是，由于防御工作做得好，人民的生命财产未受损失。当地干部和渔民在一日中午风大浪急的时候，还抢救出一只停泊在港口的四十吨重的渔船。
