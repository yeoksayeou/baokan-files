Why exactly are so many plants being planted per mu?

This spring, Qu Yang County in Hebei Province adopted the double-plant dense planting method for 100,000 mu of Baimaya corn. When planting began, the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee and Baoding Administrative Office instructed that each mu should be planted with 4,000 to 5,000 plants. As soon as the instruction was issued, another instruction came: reduce it to 3,500 to 4,000 plants per mu. Not long after, there was another instruction: the seedlings must be thinned to 3,000 to 3,500 plants per mu. When the lush green seedlings grew to be as tall as a person, another urgent instruction arrived: generally reduce it to less than 3,000 plants per mu, and less than 2,500 plants per mu for barren land. Under this instruction, although people were not very happy, they had to put aside other things to carry out the thinning work. This thinning work continued until early July, after the corn had begun to tassel. The peasants were very sad to tear out these corn plants that were about to tassel.

Due to the ever-changing instructions of the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee and Baoding Administrative Office, not only was a lot of manpower and material resources wasted, but also the enthusiasm of the masses for production was dampened, creating obstacles for the implementation of new agricultural technologies in the future. We request the higher party and government to conduct a strict inspection and handling of this matter.

Strange Promotion Methods

Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, was originally a region that planted intermediate rice. This year, the county's leading organs, in order to promote late rice, demanded that farmers change their habit of planting intermediate rice. On April 28th and May 4th, Xiang Zhigang, head of the county's Finance and Grain Section, and Pan Haichan, a district cadre, and township cadres summoned the cadres of the Guantang Township agricultural cooperatives twice in succession, demanding that the intermediate rice seedlings be destroyed, and that it be done "quickly and promptly." When the instructions reached Tongyuan Township, the township cadres asked the party members to "set an example and overcome the fear of difficulties." Township head Wang Fuming actually poured boiling water on 400 jin of intermediate rice seeds of the Wanxin Agricultural Production Cooperative, ruining them. Similar situations occurred in Yong'an, Chengjiao, Baibu, Henggang and other townships. As a result, a large amount of intermediate rice was destroyed. Tongyuan Township alone destroyed more than 2,000 jin of intermediate rice and ruined 1,500 jin of sprouted rice. This kind of action aroused the opposition of the peasants. Many women guarded the intermediate rice seedlings and would not allow them to be destroyed, not even leaving them at night. Some peasants did not listen to this and secretly planted intermediate rice as usual. Haiyan County had tried planting late rice, but the results were not successful. For example, the Hongguang Cooperative in Guantang Township planted 20 mu of late rice in 1954, with an average yield of 300 jin of grain per mu. In 1955, it planted more than 500 mu of late rice, with an average yield of 398 jin of grain per mu. And what about intermediate rice? The yield per mu was 400 jin of grain. Therefore, the peasants believed that planting late rice had high costs, low yields, and long duration, while planting intermediate rice had low costs, high yields, and short duration. The leading organs of Haiyan County did not investigate this situation, nor did they let the peasants see the benefits of this reform, but blindly promoted it rigidly, and as a result, the matter was not handled well.　Qu Xing

Task Assignment Must Also Consider the Season

On July 20th, the Heshang District of Changge County, Henan Province, convened a meeting of township cadres. At the meeting, the CPC District Committee of this district assigned work: land that has not been planted with autumn crops must be planted with corn. With the higher levels following the lower levels, the township cadres also convened a meeting of management committee members and production team leaders of each agricultural cooperative, and conveyed the task verbatim, emphasizing that corn is a high-yield crop and that land prepared for planting buckwheat must also be planted with corn.

The cooperative members had opinions when carrying out this task. One said, "Can corn still grow if it is planted at this time?" Another said, "It is okay for the higher authorities to assign tasks, but the tasks must also be in accordance with the agricultural season!" Although the cooperative members discussed a lot, no one dared not to carry out the task.

Although these corn plants, planted near "Major Heat," sprouted, they grew yellow and thin, and no one believed that they could grow grain. An elderly cooperative member said, "Just consider it as fertilizer!" Some cooperative members really plowed it into the ground to compost green manure.

The labor of the cooperative members is manpower, and the corn seeds are material resources. How wasteful of manpower and money is this! The phrase "do not violate the agricultural season" often appears in the instructions from higher authorities. Why didn't they study whether it was suitable for the agricultural season in this matter?

Why Plant More If the Harvest Is Not Good?

When I went to Qilongji, Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, to conduct a soil hydrogeological survey, I learned that there were many problems in the promotion of potato cultivation here. In the spring of 1954, potatoes were trial-planted here according to the requirements of higher authorities. However, the harvest was not good. Seventy jin of seeds were planted per mu, and only eighty jin were harvested.

In the spring of 1955, the entire township planted forty mu according to the allocated task (doubling the amount from 1954). Because the masses were unwilling to plant, and they encountered a spring drought, each mu of land only yielded more than forty jin. Although another forty mu was allocated to this area in the summer of 1955, the masses refused to plant it again. In order to take the lead, the township cadres each planted one mu. Xu De'an planted five-tenths of a mu of spring land (good land for planting cotton) with seven thousand jin of coarse manure and weeded it four times, but only harvested thirty-four jin. The masses said, "Other cadres take the lead in increasing production, but your cadres take the lead in decreasing production."

In 1956, four advanced cooperatives were established in the entire township. The task of planting potatoes allocated this spring increased from forty mu to eighty mu. The Qilong Cooperative was allocated twenty mu. Although 15,000 jin of coarse manure was applied per mu and weeded four times, the harvest was still very poor. The sixth production team harvested only 300 jin from four mu, not even enough to recover the potato seeds. This summer, the task of planting potatoes was not only not reduced, but increased by more than seven times.

If there is only planting and no harvest year after year, why is the planting area increased year by year? What benefits does this promotion of high-yield crops bring to production?

### 为什么这样领导生产？

    为什么这样领导生产？
    每亩到底该种多少株？
    河北省曲阳县今年春天采用双株密植的方法播种白马牙玉米十万亩。播种开始时，中共保定地方委员会和保定专署指示说：每亩要种到四千至五千株。指示刚下达，又来了一道指示：每亩降到三千五百至四千株。不久又指示：必须按每亩三千到三千五百株定苗。当绿油油的苗儿长到一人高的时候，又来了紧急指示：一般地每亩降到三千株以下，瘠薄的地二千五百株以下。在这个指示下，人们虽然不太高兴，但是不得不放下别的事情，来进行拔苗工作。这种拔苗工作一直搞到七月初玉米露穗以后。农民们含着泪拔掉这些快要结穗的玉米，心里是十分难过的。
    由于中共保定地委和保定专署这种变化无穷的指示，不但浪费了群众许多人力、物力，而且打击了群众的生产积极性，给今后贯彻新的农业技术造成阻碍。我们要求上级党和政府，对这件事进行严格检查处理。

    奇怪的推广方法
    浙江省海盐县本来是个种植中稻的地区，今年县的领导机关为了推广晚稻，就要求农民把种植中稻的习惯改变过来。4月28日和5月4日县财粮科长项志刚、区干部潘海蟾和乡干部先后两次把官堂乡农业合作社的干部召集起来，要求毁掉中稻秧苗，而且要“行动迅速，处理及时”。指示到了通元乡，乡干部要求党员“以身作则，克服畏难情绪”，乡长王付明竟然提上滚水把万新农业生产合作社的四百斤中稻谷种烫坏。永安、城郊、百步、横港等乡，都有类似情况发生。结果，有大量中稻被毁掉。光通元乡就毁掉中稻谷二千多斤，烫坏芽谷一千五百斤。这种干法引起了农民的反对，有不少妇女守着中稻秧苗不让毁掉，即使黑夜里也不离开，有些农民不听这一套，偷偷摸摸地照旧种植中稻。海盐县曾经试种过晚稻，结果并不成功。例如官堂乡红光社，1954年种了二十亩晚稻，每亩平均收谷三百斤。1955年种了五百余亩晚稻，每亩平均收谷三百九十八斤，而中稻呢？每亩收谷是四百斤。因此农民认为种晚稻成本高、产量低、时间长，种中稻成本低、产量高、时间短。海盐县的领导机关并不去考察这种情况，不让农民看到这种改革的好处，就硬性盲目推广，结果事情没有办好。　曲　星
    布置任务也得看看季节
    7月20日那天，河南省长葛县和尚区召集了乡干部会议，在会上，这个区的中共区委会布置工作：没有种上大秋作物的地，一律种上玉米。上行下效，乡干部也照样召集了各农业社的管理委员、生产队长以上的干部会，原原本本地把任务布置了一番，并且强调：玉米是高产作物，准备种荞麦的地也得种上玉米。
    社员们在执行这项任务时，是有意见的。这个说“这时候种玉米还能长吗？”那个说“上级给任务可以，但是，任务也得合乎农时！”社员虽然议论纷纷，但是，谁也不敢不执行任务。
    这些快到“大暑”才种上的玉米，虽然出土了，但长得又黄又瘦，谁也不相信它能长出粮食。有位上了年纪的社员说：“全当施肥吧！。”有些社员真的把它犁翻到地底下沤青肥了。
    社员劳动是人力，玉米种是物力，这样作多么劳民伤财呀！上级指示中常常有“不违误农时”的句子，为什么在这件事情上不研究一下是否适合农时呢？

    收成不好为啥还要多种
    我到安徽怀远县骑龙集作土壤水文地质调查的时候，了解到这里在推广马铃薯工作中存在着许多问题。1954年春天，这里曾根据上级要求试种过马铃薯。但是收成不好，每亩下种七十斤，收八十斤。
    1955年春天全乡按分配任务又种了四十亩（比1954年增加一倍），因为群众不愿意种，又遇到春旱，每亩地只收四十多斤。1955年夏季虽然又分配这里四十亩，但是群众都拒绝再种。乡干部为了带头，每个干部各种一亩。许得安种了五分春地（能种棉花的好地）上了七千斤粗肥，除草四次，结果只收了三十四斤。群众说：“人家干部带头增产，你们干部带头减产。”
    1956年全乡成立了四个高级社。这年春季分配种马铃薯的任务由四十亩增加到八十亩。骑龙社被分配的二十亩，虽然每亩地上了一万五千斤粗肥除草四次，但是收成依然很坏，第六生产队四亩地仅收三百斤，连薯种都收不回来。今年夏季种马铃薯的任务不但没有减少，反而加大了七倍多。
    年年只种不收，为什么还逐年增加种植面积呢？这样推广高产作物，对生产有什么好处呢？
