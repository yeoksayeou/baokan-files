The Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Sends Cadres to Strengthen Leadership and Help Agricultural Cooperatives That May Reduce Production Turn the Situation Around

(Our dispatch) The Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province is taking measures to strengthen leadership over agricultural production cooperatives with poorer performance and potential production reductions throughout the county, striving to increase the income of more cooperative members. According to a check by the County Committee in early August, there were about 163 such cooperatives, accounting for 13% of the total number of cooperatives in the county. Among these 163 cooperatives, 71 are expected to reduce production by 10% to 40% compared to last year. The remaining 92 cooperatives will not be able to achieve this year's production increase plan, with some only able to match last year's output. The more than 7,000 households of members in these cooperatives will generally have lower incomes than last year. In this situation, many cooperative cadres have lost confidence, and the morale of cooperative members is also fluctuating. 4% of the members have already withdrawn from the cooperatives, 7% are demanding to withdraw, and another 19% are pessimistic and have given up on production.

The fundamental reason for the backwardness of these agricultural cooperatives is that the Party organizations from the county to the township level have long failed to provide them with specific leadership. In terms of cadres' thinking, there is a widespread erroneous view of only paying attention to advanced cooperatives and not paying attention to backward cooperatives. Some people believe that it does not matter if these cooperatives do not perform well in production, as it will not affect the overall situation. County and district cadres rarely come to these cooperatives to help solve problems. Cadres had only visited the Taohua Agricultural Cooperative of Shuangjiang Township during the land reform and this spring when the cooperative was established. In the past six months, only one deputy district head had visited incidentally for other matters. The director of this cooperative said: "We are in such a remote place, we could stare our eyes out and no cadres would come." After the establishment of the Mingfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Tianyuan Township, the township branch secretary only visited twice. Many township cadres are unwilling to go to these cooperatives. Some reluctantly went for a few days, but found an excuse to leave.

In this situation of long-term lack of leadership, the various problems in these cooperatives cannot be resolved, and some problems have become more serious due to long-term delays. According to the inspection: 44 cooperatives have not discussed and arranged production based on the new situation for a long time. The Heyi Cooperative in Changchong Township reduced rice production by more than 65,000 jin because it failed to grasp the drought resistance efforts. The Yuelong Cooperative in Gaoqiao Township collectively raised 500 chickens, and 400 of them died within two months, resulting in a loss of more than 100 yuan. Many agricultural cooperatives have not established the superiority of poor peasants, and phenomena of middle peasants in power suppressing poor peasants occur from time to time. A few cooperatives are even manipulated by bad people to attack cooperative cadres. When the drought was severe in the Mingfeng Cooperative, the cooperative cadres did not organize the members to resist the drought, but instead told the members to go to the temple to worship gods and pray for rain. In some cooperatives, there were incidents of cooperative cadres embezzling and misappropriating public funds.

After the County Committee comprehensively inspected the problems existing in these poorly performing cooperatives, it has transferred more than 200 cadres from the county and township levels to go deep into these cooperatives to strengthen leadership. It has also instructed the general branch secretaries of the townships to personally go deep into these cooperatives to help solve problems specifically. The general approach is to start with organizing current agricultural and sideline production, striving to increase the income of more than 90% of the cooperative members. Then, based on the different situations of each cooperative, specifically solve the outstanding problems at present. Now, these cadres have gone deep down and are starting to organize autumn production. It is expected that in the next month or two, the agricultural cooperatives with more problems will be able to turn the situation around.

    中共湖南省长沙县委抽派干部加强领导
    帮助可能减产的农业社扭转局面
    本报讯　中共湖南省长沙县委会正在采取措施，对全县工作较差有可能减产的农业生产合作社加强领导，争取更多社员增加收入。据县委在8月上旬的检查，这种社约有一百六十三个，占全县总社数的13％。在这一百六十三个社中，有七十一个社要比去年减产10％到40％，其余九十二个社，都不能实现今年的增产计划，有的只能赶上去年的产量。这些社的七千多户社员，将普遍比去年减少收入。在这种情况下，不少社干部丧失信心；社员情绪也动荡不安，有4％的社员已经退社，7％的社员要求退社，还有19％的社员悲观失望，放弃生产。
    这批农业社所以落后，根本原因是从县到乡的党组织，长期没有对他们进行具体领导。在干部思想上，普遍存在着只注意先进社、不注意落后社的错误看法。有些人认为这些社生产搞不好也不要紧，影响不了大局。县、区干部很少到这些社来帮助解决问题。双江乡桃花农业社只是土地改革和今春建社的时候去过干部。在最近半年中，只有一个副区长因为旁的事顺便去过。这个社的主任说：“我们这些偏僻地方，眼睛望出血，也没有干部来。”田元乡明峰农业社建成以后，乡支部书记只去过两次。许多乡干部都不愿意到这些社去，有的勉强去了几天，也都找个借口又走出来。
    在这种长期缺乏领导的情况下，这些社里的各种问题就得不到解决，有些问题由于长期拖延发展得更严重了。据检查：有四十四个社长期没有根据新的情况，讨论和安排生产。长冲乡合益社由于没有抓紧抗旱，就减产六万五千多斤稻谷。高桥乡岳龙社集体养鸡五百只，两个月内死掉四百只，损失一百多元。许多农业社没有树立贫农优势，中农当权打击贫农的现象时有发生。少数社还被坏人操纵，打击社干部。明峰社在旱情严重的时候，社干部不组织社员抗旱，却叫社员到庙里去敬神求雨。在一部分社里发生了社干部贪污、挪用公款的事件。
    县委全面检查了这批工作差的社存在的问题以后，已经从县、乡两级抽调二百多名干部，深入到这批社去加强领导。并责成乡的总支书记亲自深入到这些社，具体帮助解决问题。在做法上，一般是从组织当前的农、副业生产入手，力争90％以上的社员增加收入。再就是针对各个社不同情况，具体解决当前突出的问题。现在，这批干部已深入下去，正在着手组织秋季生产。预料在最近一两个月内，这一批问题较多的农业社将可扭转局面。
