Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, August 10th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Changzong reports: The reporter interviewed Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers Nie Zhiwei, Zhang Dailin, Huang Kunxiong, Wang Jialun, and Rong Huaji, who returned from Dadan Island and Jinmen Island. They told me that the power of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek army is growing, and they are managing more and more things. Americans are now not only interfering in some matters of the upper echelons of the Chiang Kai-shek army authorities, but also directly inspecting whether the soldiers' weapons are wiped clean of dust and whether there are any stains on their shirts, etc. The soldiers hate these American advisors. During their inspections, if the soldiers are slightly negligent, the American military advisors will issue "memoranda." The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers are either punished or given demerits. Zhang Dailin said that once, American military advisors came to inspect the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 94th regiment of the 32nd division of the Chiang Kai-shek army he was in. They found that a soldier had not removed the cloth plugged in the muzzle of his gun, and the soldier was punished, and the company commander was also given a demerit.

The resentment of Chiang Kai-shek army officers towards American military advisors is also becoming increasingly obvious. Zhang Dailin said that in June of this year, when the 32nd division of the Chiang Kai-shek army was transferred from Taiwan to Jinmen, the companies of the 94th regiment prepared to wrap supplies in tents. Some officers reported to the regimental commander that the American military advisors had stipulated that tents were not allowed to be used to wrap things. The regimental commander was originally calm, but when he heard "American military advisors," he angrily said, "Wrap them! I don't care what regulations there are! I'll take responsibility if something happens." Nie Zhiwei said that when American military advisors came to inspect the fortification of the positions of the 243rd regiment of the 81st division of the Chiang Kai-shek army he was in, they rudely scolded a artillery platoon leader named Zheng Jiemin on the spot. Zheng Jiemin could no longer bear it. He questioned the American advisor, "Are you going to be my platoon leader too?" Afterwards, Zheng Jiemin received a demerit.

Nie Zhiwei, Zhang Dailin, and others said that many officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Jinmen Island, Dadan Island, and other places know about the motherland's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan from the broadcasts of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army on the Fujian front. Many officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army hope that this can be realized.

Some Chiang Kai-shek army officers secretly saw the propaganda materials issued by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and read the part about the peaceful liberation of Taiwan in Premier Zhou Enlai's political report made on January 30 this year. On the surface, none of the Chiang Kai-shek army officers expressed any attitude on this issue. But behind their backs, some people spoke their minds. One Chiang Kai-shek army officer said, "If the Chinese no longer fight each other, they can become more prosperous and stronger." Others believe that the situation of the Kuomintang entrenched in Taiwan should end, and it should no longer be used by the United States.

    美军顾问发号施令蒋军军官普遍不满
    据新华社福建前线10日电　新华社记者周长宗报道：记者访问了从大担岛、金门岛归来的蒋军官兵聂智威、张代林、黄坤雄、王家轮、戎华吉等。他们告诉我，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在蒋军中的权力越来越大，管的事也越来越多。美国人现在不仅是干预蒋军当局上层的一些事情，而且还直接检查士兵们的武器是否擦拭得没有一丝尘土，衬衫上有没有污垢等等。士兵们对这些美国顾问讨厌极了。在他们检查时，士兵们稍有一点疏忽，美国军事顾问就会送上“备忘录”。蒋军士兵们不是因此受罚，就是记过。张代林说，有一次美国军事顾问到他所在的蒋军三十二师九十四团二营五连检查，发现一个士兵枪口上塞的布没有取下来，这个士兵因此受了处罚，连长也被记过一次。
    蒋军军官们对美国军事顾问的反感也越来越明显。张代林说，今年六月间，蒋军三十二师由台湾调金门，九十四团各个连队准备用帐篷包裹物资。有的军官向团长报告说：美国军事顾问规定不准用帐篷包裹东西。团长本来心平气和，可是一听“美国军事顾问”，就气愤地说：“包上，管它什么规定！出了事我负责任。”聂智威说，美国军事顾问到他所在的蒋军八十一师二四三团检查阵地构筑情况时，曾当场横蛮地大骂一个名叫郑杰民的炮兵排长。郑杰民再也忍受不住了，他质问美国顾问说：“我这个排长你也要来当吗？”事后，郑杰民受了记过处分。
    聂智威、张代林等说，金门岛、大担岛等地的蒋军官兵，许多人都从福建前线中国人民解放军对蒋军官兵广播中，知道祖国号召和平解放台湾。许多蒋军官兵都希望这事能够实现。
    有些蒋军军官偷偷地看到中国人民解放军发的宣传品，读了周恩来总理在今年一月三十日所作的政治报告中关于和平解放台湾问题的部分。在表面上，蒋军军官们对这个问题谁也不表示态度。但在背后，有些人就说出了心里的话。有一个蒋军军官说：“中国不再自己人打自己人，就可以更加富强。”还有人认为：国民党负隅台湾的局面应该结束，再不要被美国利用下去。
