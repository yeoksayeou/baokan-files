Xinhua News Agency, 7th. In order to clarify the social and historical circumstances of ethnic minorities, seven comprehensive investigation and research groups organized by the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Commission are departing today, successively to regions populated by ethnic minorities, including the Northeast, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Tibet, to investigate and study the social and historical conditions of various ethnic minorities.

The investigation and research groups plan to basically clarify the socio-economic structure of each ethnic group, the social productivity, social ownership, and class situation of each ethnic group within four to seven years, and to understand the social and historical development and the special customs of each ethnic group. The investigation and research groups plan to focus on collecting information on the primitive, slave, and early feudal societies of various ethnic minorities, and the transitional periods between the above societies, in the first two years.

Approximately 200 research workers from various disciplines such as history, ethnology, language, archeology, and art are participating in these investigation and research groups.
