Mexican Fine Arts
Ni Yide

If we compare artworks to flowers, then the works in the recent "National Fine Arts Front Oil Painting and Print Exhibition of Mexico" held in the capital, in our view, can be described as surprisingly exotic overseas flowers. We say they are exotic because they are neither as gentle and delicate as lilacs, nor as娇艳妩媚娇艳妩媚 as roses, but rather like peculiar cactus-like plants growing on the Mexican prairie, robust, stubborn, and sometimes even bizarre.

Contrary to the bourgeois art that is divorced from real life, as satirized by Silva Federico's "Imperialist Aesthetes" in the exhibition, Mexican fine arts face reality squarely, sharply and powerfully exposing the darkness and ugliness of reality, and truthfully reflecting Mexico's traditions, customs, life, and struggles.

The painters did not merely express these contents in a commonplace, naturalistic way; they boldly adopted various expressive techniques, realistic techniques, and more often exaggeration, deformation, simplification, and sometimes surreal techniques. In terms of material usage, they not only used oil paints, but also widely adopted new materials such as spray paint, plastics, wax painting, egg tempera, casein tempera, transparent glue, and colored cement. But no matter what the expressive technique or material, it was adopted to express the content more strongly, and thus it was dissolved in the writer's personal style, and from the whole, it was dissolved in the Mexican traditional style. This special style, integrated with the traditions, customs, life, and struggles of the Mexican people, became an inseparable whole. After seeing such works, the audience feels like they are traveling on the vast land of Mexico and reading an epic of Mexico's modern revolutionary struggles.

First of all, from Costa Olga's "Mexican Fruits," Legorreta Ezequiel's "Sowing," Aguirre Ignacio's "Weaving Women," Ramirez Ovies Pablo's "Sawmill Workers," and Ramirez Antonio's "Fable Illustrations," we can see how rich the crops growing in the fertile land of tropical Central America are. Mexico is the kingdom of fruits – especially bananas and sugarcane; and how simple, hardworking, and life-loving the Mexican people are.

However, more paintings reflect the sad and bitter side of the Mexican people's lives. For example, Cruz Hector's "Evening," "Xicoman (village name)," and Antonio's "Brick Factory" use gloomy and somber tones to express the bleak atmosphere in the barren villages. In Marquez Nave's "Charcoal Seller," Landon's "Children of Chiapas," and Dosamantes Francisco's "Unemployed," the extremely sad images of the oppressed and harmed are depicted, while the emotions of the characters depicted in works like Rabell Vanrey's "Human Sorrow" and Mateo Jeronimo's "Night in the Hanixtlahuaca Cemetery" seem to have fallen into a fatalistic contemplation due to excessively tragic encounters.

Why are the Mexican people, who live on fertile land, trapped in such poverty and suffering? This is because Mexico, to this day, is still a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. Politics and economy are controlled by US imperialism. Colonists and landlords occupy large amounts of land. Most peasants have no land. The foreign market shrinks, and workers are unemployed, putting the entire Mexico in trouble. Chavez Morado Jose's "Gloomy Mexico" and "Nest of Evil Birds" profoundly express this situation using allegorical and metaphorical techniques. "Gloomy Mexico" depicts colonists driving a group of Mexican people, silently shrouded in the shadow of huge animal skeletons. "Nest of Evil Birds" depicts terrible chimeras crawling in holes on Mexican land, and ominous strange birds flying in the dark sky. Both paintings are full of eerie and terrifying atmosphere. Siqueiros David Alfaro's "Good Neighbor," in parentheses, reveals the true face of US imperialists with a more direct satirical approach. On a huge vertical screen, two figures are prominently depicted: Truman, walking out of a pool of blood, holding US dollars, forcing Mexican youth to serve as cannon fodder for their war of aggression. This enslaved youth embodies the image of the Mexican people and the entire Latin American people. The author uses the contrast between these two figures to loudly call on the Latin American people to be vigilant against US imperialism.

What is even more shocking is the same author's "Our Face Today." On a large canvas, simply depicts a huge, strong man with a frontal half-naked body, his hands outstretched in front, but his head is just a stubborn stone. This symbolically illustrates that the Mexican people, although possessing immense power, have lost their minds due to long-term imperialist control. Are the Mexican working people really as ignorant as stubborn stones? The author's reason for handling the character image in this way is to use the method of agitation to sound the alarm to the people, to achieve the effect of inspiring the timid and awakening the confused.

Yes, the Mexican people are by no means as ignorant as stubborn stones. On the contrary, they have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Their history is a series of continuous struggles against colonialism by Spain, Britain, France, the United States and other countries, as well as domestic monks, landlords, and big bourgeoisie. This is systematically and specifically expressed in some of the mural reproductions exhibited in the exhibition. In oil paintings, Chalezardredo's "Hidalgo - Liberator of Mexico" uses the revolutionary struggle to break away from Spanish colonial rule in 1821 as the background, and prominently depicts the image of a great and far-sighted revolutionary leader. Orozco Jose Clemente's "Revolution" summarizes and simplifies the strong and courageous image of guerrillas with his own experience in participating in the land revolutionary war. Zapata, the leader of the land revolutionary war, is depicted by Mexican painters with reverence. Covarrubias Miguel's "Zapata" is a masterpiece depicting the people's leader with strong colors and contrasts of light and dark. Soto Alvarez Rosendo's "Assault Before Dawn" vividly depicts the scene of Zapata discussing combat plans with his team members in the base area before launching an attack at dawn. However, Zapata was finally assassinated by the reactionaries. In Arenal Luis's "Zapata's Funeral," the author successfully expressed the people's feelings of grief and anger at the sacrifice of the revolutionary leader with calm colors and rigorous brushstrokes. Estrada G. Arturo's "Demonstration Parade on Constitution Square" depicts the magnificent scene of the modern workers' revolutionary struggle in the metropolis in another more cheerful tone.

Rivera Diego's large oil painting titled "Glorious Victory," in parentheses, is one that attracts a lot of attention from the audience at the exhibition. We will not forget the fact that in 1954, US imperialism conspired to subvert the relatively progressive government of Guatemala in Central America. This painting vividly reveals the essence of this fact. It is composed of four parts to form a complete picture: the main part in the middle is the scene of the so-called "victory" celebrations of the invading group and traitors. The author uses mural and satirical techniques to exaggerate and concisely depict the true faces of the main figures involved in this conspiracy, exposing them inescapably to the audience; in sharp contrast to this is the innocent people who were massacred and fell in a pool of blood in the forefront; in the rear is the expression of the people's resistance; in the left rear, bags of bananas and coffee are being transported to the "United Fruit Company" ship. Isn't this the common experience of many countries in Latin America? Guatemala is just a typical example. The author concentratedly depicted this fact with a great power of generalization, which is of great significance.

The art that fights for the freedom and independence of the Mexican nation is inseparable from opposing war and defending world peace. In the exhibition, you can also see many works with the theme of "peace." Such as Guillermo Galvan Jesus's "Pigeon," Norberto Mo. Martinez's "Self-Portrait," and C. Federico's "No More War," etc.

This exhibition of Mexican fine arts in China has undoubtedly enhanced a deeper understanding between the peoples of the two countries. In today's world where the forces of peace are so strong, and the anti-colonialist wave is so high, Mexican artists will be more confident and use healthier, more powerful, and more revolutionary optimistic art to inspire the people and encourage the people to fight for the freedom and independence of Mexico!

    墨西哥的造型艺术
    倪贻德
    如果把艺术作品比作花，那么，最近在首都举行的“墨西哥全国造型艺术阵线油画版画展览会”中的作品，在我们看来，正可说是令人惊异的海外的奇葩。说它是奇葩，因为它既非温婉纤柔如丁香，也不是娇艳妩媚如玫瑰，而像是盛长在墨西哥原野上的奇特的仙人掌那样的植物，雄健、倔强，有时甚至是怪异。
    正和展览会中的西勒瓦·费德里科的“帝国主义的审美主义者”所讽刺了的脱离现实生活的资产阶级的艺术相反，墨西哥的造型艺术是正视现实，尖锐而有力地暴露了现实的黑暗与丑恶，真实地反映了墨西哥的传统、风俗、生活和斗争。
    画家们决不是平凡地、自然主义地表现了这样的内容，他们大胆地采用了各种各样的表现手法，写实的手法，更多的是夸张、变形、单纯化的手法，有时是超现实的手法。在材料的采用方面，不仅是油画颜料，而且广泛地采用了喷漆、塑料、腊画术、蛋黄调色、干酪素调色、透明胶、彩色水泥等等新的材料。但不论是怎样的表现手法和怎样的材料，都是为了如何更强烈地表达内容而采用的，因而也就被溶化在作家个人特殊的风格中，从整个说来又是溶化在墨西哥传统的风格中。这种特殊的风格，和墨西哥人民的传统、风俗、生活和斗争溶成了不可分割的整体，观众看了这样的作品，好像旅行在墨西哥广阔的土地上，读了墨西哥近代革命斗争的史诗一样。
    首先，从科斯塔·奥尔加的“墨西哥的水果”、勒格列塔·艾杰基叶尔的“播种”、阿吉瑞·依格纳西奥的“织布女工”、拉米列兹·奥维耶兹·巴布洛的“锯木工人”、拉米列兹·安东尼奥的“寓言插图”，这些画幅上，可以看出生长于中美洲热带的肥沃土地的作物是多么富饶。墨西哥是水果——特别是香蕉和甘蔗的王国；墨西哥人民又是多么质朴、勤劳，热爱生活。
    但是，在更多的画幅上却反映出墨西哥人民生活中愁惨悲苦的一面。例如克鲁兹·艾克托尔的“傍晚”、“吉科曼（村名）”和安东尼奥的“砖厂”等画幅上，作者用灰暗低沉的色调表现了贫瘠的荒村中的惨淡气氛。在马尔凯兹·纳维的“卖炭女”、兰登的“恰巴斯的孩子”、多沙曼捷斯·弗兰西斯科的“失业者”这些画幅上，描写了被压迫、被损害者的极度愁惨的形象，而像拉别洛·范雷的“人类的悲哀”、马捷奥·赫罗尼摩的“汉尼特兹尤墓地之夜”那几幅画所表现的人物的感情，似乎因过分悲惨的遭遇而陷入宿命的沉思中了。
    生活在富饶土地上的墨西哥的人民，为什么陷于如此贫穷愁苦的境遇呢？这是由于墨西哥到目前为止，还是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，政治、经济都被美帝国主义所控制，殖民者和地主占有大量的土地，大多数农民没有土地，对外市场缩减，工人失业，使整个墨西哥陷于困境。察维兹·摩拉多·贺塞的“阴郁的墨西哥”和“恶鸟之巢”，正是用了隐射的、比喻的手法深刻地表现了这样的情况。“阴郁的墨西哥”描写殖民者正赶着一群墨西哥人民，默默地被笼罩在巨大的动物骸骨的阴影之下。“恶鸟之巢”描写在墨西哥的土地上，有可怕的魑魅在穴中爬行，不祥的怪鸟在阴暗的天空飞行。这两幅画都充满了阴森恐怖的气氛。西盖罗斯·大卫·阿勒法罗的加了括号的“善良的邻居”，以更直接的讽刺手法揭露了美帝国主义者的真实面貌。在巨大的直幅画面上，突出地描写了两个人物：从血泊中走出来的杜鲁门，拿着美金，逼迫墨西哥青年为他们的侵略战争充当炮灰。这个被奴役的青年，概括了墨西哥人民和整个拉丁美洲人民的形象。作者正是通过了这两个人物的对比，大声地唤起拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义提高警惕。
    使人更触目惊心的，是同上作者的“我们今日的面貌”。在大幅的画面上，单纯地描写了一个巨大粗壮的男子正面半身裸体，两手伸向前方，而他的头却只是一块顽石。这象征地说明了墨西哥的人民虽具有巨大无比的力量，但由于帝国主义的长期控制而失去思想了。难道墨西哥劳动人民真的像顽石一般毫无思想么？作者之所以如此处理这样的人物形象，是以激将法向人民敲起警钟，以收到使懦怯者振奋、使昏瞶者惊醒的效果。
    是的，墨西哥人民决不像顽石那样的无知，正相反，他们具有光荣的革命传统。他们的历史，是一系列的同西班牙、英、法、美等国的殖民主义者以及本国僧侣、地主、大资产阶级不断地斗争的历史。这在展览会中展出的一部分壁画的复制品上系统地具体地表现了出来。在油画作品中，查勒塞·阿勒德列多的“伊达尔哥——墨西哥的解放者”，以1821年摆脱西班牙殖民统治的革命斗争为背景，突出地描写了伟大的深谋远虑的革命领导者的形象。奥罗兹柯·贺塞·克列门特的“革命去”，作者以亲身参加土地革命战争的体验，概括地、单纯化地描写游击队员坚强果敢的形象。扎巴达，这位土地革命战争的领导者，墨西哥的画家们以崇敬的心情描写了他。科瓦尔鲁比阿斯·米古叶尔的“扎巴达”，是以强烈的色彩和明暗对比描写人民领袖的佳作。梭托·阿勒瓦列兹·罗逊多的“黎明前的突击”，生动地描写了扎巴达于黎明出击前在根据地和队员们商议作战计划的情景。但是，扎巴达终于为反动派所暗害了。在阿列纳尔·路易士的“扎巴达的葬礼”上，作者以沉着的色彩和严谨的笔调成功地表现了人民对革命领袖的牺牲而表示的悲痛愤怒的感情。艾斯特拉达·格·阿尔图洛的“宪法广场上的示威游行”，以另一种较为明快的调子描写了在大都市中的现代工人的革命斗争的壮烈场景。
    里维拉·德哥以加了括号的“光荣的胜利”为标题的大幅油画，是展览会中很吸引观众的一幅。我们不会忘记1954年美帝国主义阴谋颠复中美洲危地马拉比较进步的政府这一事实。这幅画形象地揭露了这一事实的本质，它由四个组成部分构成了完整的画面：中间主要的部分是侵略集团和叛徒们所谓“胜利”的祝贺的场面，作者以壁画的、讽刺画的手法，夸张而简练地描写了参与这一阴谋的主要人物的真实面貌，使他们无可逃遁地暴露在观众的面前；与此恰成对比的是最前方倒在血泊中的被残杀的无辜人民；在后方是表现人民的反抗力量；在左后方，一袋一袋的香蕉和咖啡正在向“联合果品公司”的轮船搬运。这样的情况难道不是拉丁美洲许多国家共同的遭遇吗？危地马拉只是一个典型的例子，作者以巨大的概括力量集中地描写了这一事实，是具有重大的意义的。
    为墨西哥民族的自由和独立而斗争的艺术，是和反对战争、保卫世界和平分不开的。在展览会中，也可以看到很多以“和平”为题材的作品。如古叶尔列罗·加尔万·赫苏斯的“鸽子”、诺尔别尔托·莫·马尔吉涅兹的“自画像”、西·费德里科的“不要有战争”等。
    这次墨西哥的造型艺术在中国的展览，无疑是增进了两国人民更深一步的了解。在全世界和平力量如此强大了的今天，在反殖民主义的浪潮如此高涨的今天，墨西哥的艺术家们，将更加满怀信心，以更健康有力、更富有革命乐观主义精神的艺术去激励人民、鼓舞人民，为墨西哥的自由、独立而斗争！（附图片）
