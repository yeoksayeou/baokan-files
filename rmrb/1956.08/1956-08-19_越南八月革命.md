    The Vietnamese August Revolution

    Today is the eleventh anniversary of the victory of the Vietnamese August Revolution.

    The Vietnamese nation has a long history of about three thousand years, but due to the long-term constraints of the feudal system and foreign control, Vietnam's social development has been very slow. In particular, after the French colonialists occupied Vietnam in 1885, the Vietnamese people suffered even more profound enslavement and cruel exploitation, and their lives were extremely painful.

    From the moment the French invaders set foot on Vietnamese soil, the freedom- and independence-loving Vietnamese people fought bravely and successively. After the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist struggle received correct and strong leadership, and the revolutionary forces grew stronger and developed. During the Second World War, France suffered a devastating blow from Hitler's Germany and surrendered to Germany in June 1940. The French colonialists in Indochina soon succumbed to Japanese fascism and signed the so-called Franco-Japanese Joint Defense of Indochina Agreement. In September 1940, the Japanese imperialist army entered Vietnam. The dual bloody rule of Japanese imperialism and French colonialists aroused greater anger and resistance from the Vietnamese people. From September 1940 to January 1941 alone, the Vietnamese people held three armed uprisings.

    In order to mobilize and organize the people of the whole country to participate more widely in the movement to resist the enemy and save the country, in May 1941, a national united front including all Vietnamese democratic parties and national salvation organizations - the Vietnam Independence League (abbreviated as Viet Minh) was established. On December 22, 1944, the first people's armed force in Vietnam was declared born. From then on, the Vietnamese people's armed struggle entered a new stage. As German and Japanese fascists were dealt fatal blows by the Allied forces, the contradictions between France and Japan in Indochina became increasingly acute. In order to save its defeat, the Japanese invading army disarmed the French army in Indochina on March 9, 1945. At this time, the Japanese forces in the vast rural areas of Vietnam were not stable. The Vietnamese people seized this good opportunity and immediately launched a heroic armed offensive against the enemy, occupying many strongholds and vast areas, seizing a large number of weapons, and the movement to resist Japan and save the country entered a climax throughout the country. From March to August 1945, the Communist Party and the Viet Minh actively carried out enormous propaganda and organizational work, established guerrilla bases in the northern provinces of Vietnam, encouraged and mobilized the masses to prepare for a nationwide armed uprising. When the news of the surrender of Japanese imperialism on August 15 reached Vietnam, the broad masses of people across the country, under the call and leadership of the Viet Minh, acted like a raging tide and launched an offensive against the Japanese army. On August 19, the Vietnamese People's Army liberated the capital, Hanoi. Soon, the southern provinces of Vietnam were also liberated. The Vietnamese people's heroic struggle for national independence against French colonial rule and Japanese fascist aggression, which had lasted for more than 80 years, achieved a great victory. On September 2, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was officially established. From then on, Vietnam leaped from a feudal and colonial country to a new type of people's democratic country. The August Revolution has become the most glorious page in Vietnamese history.

    Since 1954, according to the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have merged the anniversary of the August Revolution (August 19) and Independence Day (September 2) to celebrate together. Now, in order to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the Vietnamese August Revolution and Independence, the Vietnamese government has established a central organizing committee to begin preparations. On August 10, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor called on all workers and staff to strive to overfulfill the national plan and strengthen the struggle for national reunification, and use practical actions to greet these two festivals of great historical significance.

    越南八月革命
    今天是越南八月革命胜利十一周年纪念日。
    越南民族有着约三千年的悠久历史，但是，由于过去长时期地受着封建制度的束缚和外国的控制，越南的社会发展非常缓慢。特别是1885年法国殖民者侵占越南之后，越南人民更遭受到深重的奴役和残酷的剥削，生活十分痛苦。
    从法国侵略者踏上越南的土地时起，爱好自由和独立的越南人民就前仆后继地进行了英勇的斗争。1930年印度支那共产党成立之后，越南人民的反帝斗争得到了正确而坚强的领导，革命的势力日益壮大和发展。在第二次世界大战期间，法国遭到希特勒德国毁灭性的打击，于1940年6月向德国投降。在印度支那的法国殖民者不久也向日本法西斯屈膝妥协，签订了所谓法日共同防守印度支那的协定。1940年9月，日本帝国主义的军队开进了越南。日本帝国主义和法国殖民者双重的血腥统治激起了越南人民更大的愤怒和反抗。仅在1940年9月至1941年1月间，越南人民便举行了三次武装起义。
    为了动员和组织全国人民更广泛地参加抗敌救国运动，1941年5月成立了一个包括全越各民主党派和各救国团体的民族统一战线——越南独立同盟（简称越盟）。1944年12月22日，越南第一支人民武装部队宣告诞生，从此，越南人民的武装斗争进入了一个新的阶段。由于德国和日本法西斯受到同盟国军队的致命打击，法国和日本在印度支那的矛盾日益尖锐。为了挽救它的失败，日本侵略军在1945年3月9日解除了印度支那的法国军队的武装。这时，日本在越南广大农村的势力并不稳固。越南人民抓紧了这个良好的时机，立即对敌人发动了英勇的武装进攻，占领了许多据点和广大地区，缴获了大批武器，抗日救国的运动在全国各地进入了高潮。在1945年3月至8月间，共产党和“越盟”积极地进行了巨大的宣传和组织工作，在越北各省都建立了游击基地，鼓舞和发动群众起来准备全国武装总起义。当日本帝国主义在八月十五日投降的消息传到越南后，全国各地广大人民群众在“越盟”的号召和领导下像怒潮一般行动起来，对日本军队展开进攻。八月十九日，越南人民军队解放首都河内。不久，南越各省也解放了。越南人民八十多年来不屈不挠地进行的反对法国殖民统治和日本法西斯侵略、争取民族独立的英勇斗争获得了伟大的胜利。九月二日，越南民主共和国宣告正式成立。从此，越南便从一个封建主义和殖民地国家跃进到新型的人民民主国家。八月革命也就成为越南历史上最光辉的一页。
    从1954年起，根据越南民主共和国政府的决定，越南人民把八月革命纪念日（八月十九日）和独立日（九月二日）合并在一起来庆祝。现在，为了庆祝越南八月革命和独立十一周年，越南政府已经成立了一个中央组织委员会，开始进行筹备工作。八月十日，越南总工会号召全体工人和职员努力超额完成国家计划和加强争取祖国统一的斗争，用实际行动来迎接这两个具有伟大历史意义的节日。　（周）
