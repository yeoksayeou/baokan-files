Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 4th. Led by Wang Hongzhi, a Second-Class Air Force Model of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, four transport planes today air-dropped more than 7,600 *jin* of cooked rice and steamed buns over Yuhang and Xiangshan counties in Zhejiang Province, as well as Nanjiushan Island, to aid the masses affected by floods caused by the typhoon. This reporter accompanied the planes to these areas and saw that many places were still threatened by the floodwaters. The county seats of Yuhang and Xiangshan are still surrounded by floodwaters, and many affected people have built temporary homes on the hillsides in these areas. In some areas, the floodwaters have begun to recede, and seedlings of crops have emerged. Vehicles and ships are already traveling on the highways and rivers leading to Yuhang.

These rice and steamed buns were specially made by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee to aid the affected people in the above-mentioned areas. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee is also preparing to continue air-dropping relief supplies to other disaster areas. Responsible comrades from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee also took a plane to these areas today for inspection.

    四架运输机到余杭、象山等地
    空投大批食品救济灾民
    新华社杭州4日电　由中国人民解放军空军某部二级空军模范王洪智率领的四架运输机，今天在浙江省余杭、象山两县和南韭山岛等地上空空投了七千六百多斤熟大米和馒头等食品，救济因台风引起洪水而受灾的群众。本社记者随同飞机一起飞临这些地区上空。看到很多地方仍然受到大水的威胁。余杭、象山两县县城还在大水的包围中，不少受灾群众在这些地方的山坡上盖起了临时家园。有的地区大水已经开始退落。庄稼已露出青苗。伸向余杭的公路和河流中已有车辆和船只往来。
    这些大米和馒头是浙江省人民委员会专门为救济上述地区受灾群众定做的。浙江省人民委员会还准备去其他受灾地区继续空投救济物资。浙江省人民委员会负责同志在今天也乘飞机前往这些地区进行巡视。
