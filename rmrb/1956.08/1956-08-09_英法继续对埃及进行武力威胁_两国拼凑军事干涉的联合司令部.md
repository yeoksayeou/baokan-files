Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: France and Britain continue to threaten Egypt with force and put together a joint command for military intervention.
According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 8th, the French Ministry of Defense spokesman said in Paris on the 7th that if military action were to occur in the Middle East, Britain and France would undoubtedly establish a joint command. The spokesman also said that officers from the French General Staff are currently in close contact with British staff officers in London.
Associated Press reported that at a meeting on the 6th between French Defense Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury and the French Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff and the Deputy Ministers of the Navy and Air Force of the Ministry of Defense, it was unanimously agreed in principle to establish a joint British-French command. Senior French naval personnel, including the commander of the French Mediterranean Fleet and the commander of the North African Fleet, also held a meeting in Toulon on the 5th, where they formulated methods for liaison with the British fleet.
United Press International reported that the French agreed that the commander of the joint command should be British, because Britain has stronger naval power.
At the same time, Britain and France continue to carry out military deployments and gatherings to intimidate Egypt.

    据新华社8日讯　法国国防部发言人七日在巴黎说，如果中东一旦发生军事行动，英国和法国无疑将成立一个联合司令部。这个发言人又说，法国总参谋部的军官们目前正在伦敦同英国参谋官们保持密切联系。
    美联社消息说，在六日法国国防部长布歇—莫努里同法国陆、海军参谋长和国防部海军、空军次长举行的会议上，已经一致同意了设立英法联合司令部的原则。包括法国地中海舰队司令和北非舰队司令在内的法国高级海军人员也已经在五日在土伦举行了会议，会上拟订了同英国舰队联络的方法。
    合众社消息说，法国人同意联合司令部的统帅由英国担任，因为英国在海军方面力量较强。
    同时，英国和法国继续进行恫吓埃及的军事调动和集结。
