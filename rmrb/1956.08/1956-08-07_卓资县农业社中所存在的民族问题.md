Editor's Note: The problems reflected in this article regarding ethnic work in some agricultural production cooperatives exist to varying degrees in many regions. Therefore, they should attract the attention of ethnic united societies and ethnic affairs workers in various localities. Only through thorough inspections, sufficient attention from leadership, and good education on ethnic policies among staff and the masses can these problems be reasonably resolved.

More than 90% of the residents of Zhuozi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are Han Chinese, and the rest are Mongolian and other fraternal ethnic groups, totaling 287 households. Zhuozi County has achieved agricultural cooperativization throughout the county and has established thirty-three ethnic united cooperatives. In these cooperatives, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups work together, help each other, and strengthen ethnic unity.

However, due to the Zhuozi County leadership's neglect of ethnic work, many problems exist in some ethnic united cooperatives that urgently need to be addressed. These problems are:

Some cooperatives do not pay enough attention to leveraging the expertise of Mongolian members in livestock management. For example, the cooperative cadres in Kundulung Township do not assign Mongolian members to graze livestock but instead send four Han members to graze. Mongolian members said with dissatisfaction, "You say you're taking care of us, but why don't you let us graze?" Because Mongolian members cannot leverage their expertise in animal husbandry and cannot master agricultural production techniques in a short period, they cannot participate in agricultural labor, and some people's incomes have decreased, and their lives have declined. Mongolian people's need for livestock production loans is also not met. Of the 8,000 yuan in livestock loans allocated to Zhuozi County by higher authorities last year, half has not yet been loaned to Mongolian people. Therefore, some Mongolian people are not settled in their production and want to move. In the past two years, thirty-seven Mongolian households have already moved to pastoral areas in other banners (counties). Ulandai (Mongolian), the head of Halagaitu Township in the Second District, said, "You move first, and in a year or two, I will leave too!"

The production share fund and water conservancy loan apportionment in some cooperatives are unreasonable. When the primary cooperatives were established in the autumn of last year, the production share fund was apportioned according to an 80% land and 20% labor ratio. Mongolian members have more land, so they are apportioned more. Eighteen Mongolian households in Tuchengzi Township were apportioned a total of 1,550 yuan. Soon, the primary cooperatives were transformed into advanced cooperatives. In principle, the share fund of advanced cooperatives should be apportioned according to labor, but they did not do so.

Tuchengzi Township opened a canal in 1953. At that time, water conservancy loans were issued according to the amount of land. Mongolian people had more land, so they received more loans. However, the canal has not yielded much benefit since its construction. In 1954, all of this irrigated land was incorporated into the cooperative. Now the canal has been transferred to the advanced cooperative along with the land, but Mongolian people are still responsible for repaying the loans or paying interest. Some Mongolian people are therefore in debt for a long time.

Although ethnic cadres are assigned to ethnic united cooperatives, most of them have titles but no power. Since Humulinge, a Mongolian woman from Tuchengzi Township, became the deputy director of the cooperative, the director of the cooperative rarely consults with her when things come up. She said, "My deputy director position is just a figurehead." In particular, there is a shortage of ethnic cadres in the production teams and grass-roots organizations of the cooperatives. Han cadres in the cooperatives cannot understand the needs and difficulties of Mongolian people in production and life.

Not enough attention is paid to the living habits, languages, and writing of Mongolian people. Mongolian people are accustomed to eating dairy products and fried rice. When the fifteen Mongolian households in Balinguole Village, Tuchengzi Township, joined the cooperative, only two households kept dairy cows, and the remaining dairy cows were priced and returned to the cooperative. They wanted to keep more dairy cows, but there was no grass to feed them. Mongolian people could not eat milk, so they had to reluctantly squeeze some goat's milk for milk tea. Mongolian people use millet for fried rice, but it is not available in supply and marketing cooperatives, so they have to use millet instead. The schools in Zhuozi County do not have Mongolian language classes. If Mongolian people's children want to learn Mongolian, they must go to other banners (counties) to learn. Some Mongolian people say that if this continues, Mongolian children will not be able to speak Mongolian. All thirty-three Mongolian-Han united cooperatives in the county do not have Mongolian accounting books.

In some ethnic united cooperatives, due to insufficient education of members by the leadership, some Han members are not enthusiastic, proactive, and voluntary enough in helping Mongolian members with production techniques. Some individual Han members also have narrow-minded conservative ideas. They do not teach techniques for fear that Mongolian people will learn the techniques and reduce their own work points for technical work. Most Mongolian people in the cooperatives can only do rough work.

The above problems arise mainly because the Zhuozi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has long neglected ethnic work. For a long time, they have not seriously studied the production and life problems of ethnic minorities. Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent people to help the Zhuozi County Committee conduct inspections in some ethnic united cooperatives. Gao Chonglin, the Secretary of the Zhuozi County Committee, also personally went to Tuchengzi Township in the Fourth District, where there are more Mongolian people, to hold a forum for Mongolian members to investigate their difficulties in production and life. Now, the Zhuozi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is also carrying out education on ethnic policies both inside and outside the Party. It is hoped that they will be able to solve these problems as soon as possible through more practical work.

    卓资县农业社中所存在的民族问题
    巴图
    编者按：这篇文章所反映的一些农业生产合作社在民族工作中所存在的问题，在不少地区都或多或少的存在着，因此应引起各地民族联合社和民族工作者的注意。对这些问题，只有经过深入的检查，引起领导上充分的注意，在工作人员和群众中很好地进行民族政策的教育，才有可能获得合理的解决。
    内蒙古自治区卓资县居民有90％以上是汉族人，其余是蒙族和其他兄弟民族，共有287户。卓资全县已实现了农业合作化，并且建立了三十三个民族联合社。在这些合作社中，各民族农牧民共同劳动，互相帮助，加强了民族团结。
    但是，由于卓资县领导上忽视了民族工作，因此在一些民族联合社中，存在着不少问题，急须加以解决。这些问题是：
    少数合作社不重视发挥蒙族社员经营畜牧业的特长。如：坤都隆乡的社干部不叫蒙族社员去放牧牲畜，而派四个汉族社员去放牧。蒙族社员不满地说：“说是照顾我们，可是为什么不让我们放牧呢？”由于蒙族社员不能在牧业上发挥自己的特长，短时间内又不能掌握农业生产技术，不能参加农业劳动，有些人的收入也就减少，生活也就下降。蒙民需要牧业生产贷款也得不到，去年上级拨给卓资县的八千元牧业贷款，至今还有一半没有贷到蒙民手中。因此有些蒙民生产不安心，想搬家。过去两年中，就已经有三十七户蒙民搬到外旗的牧业区。二区哈拉盖图乡乡长乌兰代（蒙族）说：“你们先搬，过一、二年我也走呀！”
    少数合作社的生产股份基金和水利贷款摊纳的不合理。在去年秋后建立初级社时，生产股份基金是按地八劳二的比例摊纳的。蒙族社员土地多，摊的也就多，土城子乡十八户蒙族社员共摊纳1，550元。不久，初级社就转为高级社。按说，高级社的股份基金应按劳力摊纳，但是他们并没有这样做。
    土城子乡在1953年开了一道水渠。当时水利贷款是按土地多少发放的。蒙民土地多，得到的贷款也多。但是水渠修成后还没有得多少利，1954年这些水地全部入了合作社，现在渠道已随土地转归高级社使用，但却仍由蒙民负责归还贷款或缴纳利息。有些蒙民因此长期负债。
    少数民族联合社中虽然配备了民族干部，但是多数是有职无权。土城子乡蒙族妇女胡都林格自担任合作社的副主任以来，社主任有事很少找她商量，她说：“我这个副主任是挂名的。”特别是合作社的生产队和基层组织里，缺少民族干部。社里汉族干部不能很好地体会蒙民在生产和生活方面的要求和困难。
    对蒙族的生活习惯、语言文字重视不够。蒙民习惯吃奶食和炒米。土城子乡巴林郭勒村十五户蒙民，在入社时，只有二户留了奶牛，其余的奶牛都作价归了社。他们想多留一些奶牛，又没有草喂。蒙民吃不上牛奶，只好勉强挤点羊奶作奶茶。蒙民作炒米用糜子，在供销社买不到，只好改用谷子。卓资县的学校没有蒙古语文班，蒙民的子弟要学蒙文，必须得到外旗去学。有些蒙民说，这样下去，蒙古小孩都要不会说蒙古话了。全县三十三个蒙汉联合社，都没有蒙文会计账簿。
    在有些民族联合社里，由于领导上对社员的教育不够，有些汉族社员对蒙族社员在生产技术上的帮助还不够热情、积极和主动。个别汉族社员还有狭隘的保守思想，有技术不教，怕蒙民学到了技术，会降低自己做技术活的工分。大多数蒙民在合作社里还只能作粗活。
    产生上述问题，主要是因为中共卓资县委长期忽视民族工作。很久以来，他们就没有认真地研究过一次少数民族的生产和生活问题。最近中共内蒙古自治区党委派人帮助卓资县的党委到一些民族联合社里作了检查，卓资县县委书记高崇林同志也亲自到蒙民较多的四区土城子乡召开了蒙族社员座谈会，调查了他们在生产和生活上的困难。现在，中共卓资县委也正在党内外开展关于民族政策的教育。希望他们能够通过更多的实际工作，尽快的解决这些问题。
