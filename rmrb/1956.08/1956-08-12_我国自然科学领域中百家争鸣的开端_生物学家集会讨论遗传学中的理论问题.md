Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 10th (Reporter Lü Xinchu): Biologists began discussing here today the theoretical issues long debated in genetics by various countries, as well as problems in research work. This marks the beginning of the "Hundred Schools of Thought" movement in China's natural sciences.

    The forty-plus scientists attending this genetics symposium come from research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agricultural and forestry research institutions, and universities. They include geneticists (including those of the Michurin genetics school and the Mendel-Morgan genetics school), as well as experts in breeding, cytology, microbiology, plant physiology, plant ecology, animal embryology, biochemistry, experimental biology, and other fields. In order to fully and effectively express their views at this meeting, some scientists have spent several months preparing beforehand, reading a large amount of literature and reference books, and collecting a great deal of data.

    The symposium will focus on discussing the material basis of heredity (including vegetative hybridization), the relationship between heredity and environment, the relationship between heredity and individual development (with emphasis on the theory of phased development), the relationship between heredity and phylogenetic development (including species and speciation), and some issues in scientific research and teaching.

    This morning, the first speaker at the meeting was the chairman of the symposium, Tong Dizhou, Deputy Director of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In explaining the purpose of the meeting, he pointed out that genetics involves a wide range of biological sciences and is a hotly debated issue in various countries. In the past, our study of the Soviet Union and mastery of the Michurin doctrine were not comprehensive enough and contained deviations. We have not paid enough attention to the development of the Morgan school of thought in recent years. Therefore, scientists feel that holding such a meeting is very necessary. Tong Dizhou hoped that the scientists present would debate thoroughly and speak their minds. They should also discuss and put forward opinions on what methods and attitudes should be adopted in future genetic research and teaching.

    Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at the meeting that genetics is one of the urgently needed scientific departments to catch up with the world's advanced level within twelve years. Convening this meeting is to hope that China's genetics will catch up with or approach the world level within twelve years.

    This symposium is jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education and will last for fifteen days.

    我国自然科学领域中百家争鸣的开端
    生物学家集会讨论遗传学中的理论问题
    新华社青岛10日电　新华社记者吕新初报道：生物学家今天开始在这里讨论遗传学中各国长期以来争论的理论问题和研究工作中的问题，这是我国在自然科学领域中百家争鸣的开端。
    出席这个遗传学座谈会的四十多个科学家来自中国科学院的研究机构、农、林业方面的研究机构以及高等学校，他们中间有遗传学家，（包括米丘林遗传学和孟德尔、摩尔根遗传学），以及育种学、细胞学、微生物学、植物生理学、植物生态学、动物胚胎学、生物化学、实验生物学等各方面的专家。为了在这次会上充分、有力地发挥自己的见解，有的科学家在会前已经作了几个月的准备，阅读了大量文献和参考书，收集了许多资料。
    座谈会将着重讨论遗传的物质基础（包括无性杂交）、遗传和环境的关系、遗传同个体发育的关系（着重阶段发育理论）、遗传和系统发育的关系（包括物种和物种形成），及科学研究和教学中的一些问题。
    今天上午，首先在会上讲话的是座谈会的主持人、中国科学院生物学地学部副主任童第周。他在说明这次会议的目的时指出：遗传学在生物科学中涉及的范围很广，又是各国争论得很尖锐的问题；我们过去学习苏联、掌握米丘林学说不够全面，并且有偏差；对于近年来摩尔根学派的学说的发展情况注意不够；所以科学家们感到举行这样的会议是十分必要的。童第周希望到会的科学家要争论得很透彻，说出心里话；对今后遗传学的研究和教学应该采取什么方式和态度的问题，也要讨论和提出意见。
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢在会上说：遗传学是在十二年内要赶上世界先进水平的急需科学部门之一，召开这个会议，便是希望在十二年内使中国的遗传学赶上或接近世界水平。
    这次座谈会是中国科学院和高等教育部召开的，将举行十五天。
