Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 29th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Tao Suqi):

    The people of Harbin, with heroic tenacity, fought the largest flood in history for twenty-five days and nights, finally victoriously protecting this modern industrial city on the banks of the Songhua River.

    The most serious flood in the Songhua River basin with historical records occurred in 1932 during the puppet Manchukuo regime. On August 7th of that year, Harbin, with a population of 400,000, suffered a dike breach. The bustling Daoli and Daowai districts were completely flooded, and more than 2,000 citizens died from drowning or disease. This year, in August, the highest water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area was thirty-four centimeters higher than in 1932. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the city's people kept the raging flood outside the dikes. Factories in the city continued production as usual, and stores remained open for business. Products from newly built modern factories such as the Measuring & Cutting Tools Plant, the Electric Motor Plant, the Electric Meter & Instrument Plant, and the Flax Textile Mill continued to be shipped to all parts of the country. The lives and property of over one million people in the city were not lost. This stands in stark contrast to the tragic situation after the city was flooded in 1932.

    This year's flood was particularly fierce, with successive major peaks, and the water level rose by more than thirty centimeters in a single day and night. The highest water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area reached 120.06 meters, with a maximum flow of 13,000 cubic meters per second. The flood peak, accompanied by a force seven gale and torrential rain, created an extremely urgent situation. Party and government leaders in Harbin rushed to the dikes to direct operations day and night, and leading cadres from various organs, factories, enterprises, schools, and the garrison also led the masses to the dikes. The Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army promptly dispatched a unit to provide support.

    A total of 300,000 soldiers and civilians directly participated in flood prevention. Thousands of vehicles and ships, all fully loaded with mud and rocks, headed towards the dikes. The newly built 2.5-kilometer-long railway for transporting soil, dozens of pontoon bridges, and aerial ropeways quickly delivered mud and rocks directly to the dikes. At the city's railway station, flood control materials sent from all over the country were unloaded day and night. More than one million sacks and straw bags, 120,000 meters of electrical wire, and more than 100,000 wooden stakes were used in this flood prevention effort, creating a long wave-breaking wooden barrier in front of the dikes, with critical sections of the dikes reinforced with sacks filled with mud. After dozens of days of emergency repairs, the tens of kilometers of dikes along the river in the urban area have become a towering Great Wall, defending the safety of Harbin.

    The people of Harbin fully realized the slogan "Everything for overcoming the flood and ensuring the safety of Harbin." Soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yang Changli, worker Sun Jizhong, farmer Li Zhenhai, and member of a handicraft production cooperative, Cui Zhenrong, heroically sacrificed their precious lives to protect the safety of Harbin. Workers at riverside factories such as the Harbin Cement Plant and the Paper Mill maintained production while organizing rescue teams and water squads to repair dikes and conduct emergency repairs. They rested by the dikes after work, ready to get up and repair the dikes at any time. Workers at the Heavy Industry Ministry's Metal Structure Company in Xiangfang, a high-lying area of the city, successively rescued six of the most dangerous sections of the dike, becoming a powerful emergency rescue team in the city's flood prevention efforts. Professors and experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Civil Engineering, the Ministry of Water Resources' Harbin Design Institute, Northeast Agricultural College, Harbin Institute of Technology, and other institutions voluntarily went to the flood prevention headquarters to contribute their technical expertise. Engineers checked for dangers on the river dikes day and night.

    During this short period of flood prevention, more than 16,000 flood prevention models and more than 300 flood prevention collective models emerged. They created countless heroic and glorious deeds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 29th: On the evening of the 29th, the people of Harbin held a celebration rally and celebration party to celebrate the victory over the flood.

    More than 20,000 people attended the rally, and 332 flood prevention model units and 16,484 flood prevention models from across the city were rewarded by the Harbin Municipal People's Committee at the rally.

    Wang Huacheng, Deputy Mayor of Harbin, spoke at the meeting. He said that the victory over the flood was huge, proving that under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, the people of Harbin, united as one, have the unparalleled strength to overcome all difficulties and all natural disasters. He pointed out that the future tasks of the people of the city are to continue to give play to creative labor, strive to make up for the losses suffered in production and work during the flood prevention period, and strive to complete various socialist construction tasks.

    Today, the streets of Harbin are decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. At night, the city is brightly lit, and entertainment venues and eleven open-air evening party theaters received 300,000 people who participated in the flood prevention efforts.

    哈尔滨市人民战胜空前的大洪水
    全市张灯结彩举行庆祝大会和晚会
    据新华社哈尔滨29日电　新华社记者陶肃琦报道：
    哈尔滨市人民英勇顽强地和历史上最大的洪水搏斗了二十五昼夜，终于胜利地保住了松花江畔这座近代化的工业城市。
    松花江流域有历史记载的最严重的一次洪水，发生在伪满统治时期的1932年。当年8月7日，拥有四十万人口的哈尔滨，堤防溃决了。繁华的道里、道外市区全部被淹，市民被淹死和患病死亡的有两千多人。而今年8月哈尔滨地区松花江的最高水位，比1932年高出三十四公分。全市人民在共产党领导下，把凶猛的洪水一直挡在大堤之外。市内工厂照常生产，商店照常营业。量具刃具厂、电机厂、电表仪器厂、亚麻纺织厂等新建近代化工厂的产品，仍旧源源运往全国各地。市区一百多万人民的生命和财产都没有遭到损失。这同1932年市区被淹后凄惨的情状，恰成鲜明的对照。
    今年的洪水来势特别凶猛，大洪峰接连而来，水位在一昼夜之间就上涨了三十多公分。哈尔滨地区松花江的最高水位达一二零点零六公尺，每秒钟的最大流量达一万三千公方。洪峰伴着七级大风和暴雨一起袭来，水情极为紧急。哈尔滨市的党、政负责干部不分昼夜分头奔赴堤防指挥，各机关、工厂、企业、学校和驻军的领导干部也都带领群众上堤。中国人民解放军沈阳军区及时派出一支部队，前来支援。
    全市共有三十万军民直接参加了防汛。各种车辆和船舶成千上万，都满载着泥土、石块驶往堤坝。新修的二点五公里长的马路运土铁道、几十座浮桥和高空索道，使泥土、石块迅速地直接送上大堤。市区的火车站上，日夜不停地卸下全国各地送来的防汛器材。在这次防汛中使用的麻袋和草袋有一百多万条、电线十二万公尺和木桩十万多根，使堤坝前出现了一条绵长的防浪木排，险要的堤段都垒着满装泥土的麻袋。经过几十天的抢修，沿江市区几十公里长的大堤已经成为一道巍峨的长城，捍卫了哈尔滨的安全。
    哈尔滨全市人民实现了“一切为了战胜洪水，确保哈尔滨安全”的口号。中国人民解放军某部战士杨昌里、工人孙继忠、农民李振海、手工业生产合作社社员崔振荣为了保卫哈尔滨的安全，英勇地献出了宝贵的生命。哈尔滨水泥厂、造纸厂等沿江工厂的职工们一面坚持生产，一面组织抢险队、水兵队，紧张地修堤抢险。他们下班后躺在堤坝边休息，随时准备起来抢修堤坝。市区高地香坊的重工业部金属结构公司的职工们先后抢救了六处最险要的堤坝，成为全市防汛斗争中一支强有力的抢险队。中国科学院土木研究所、水利部哈尔滨设计院、东北农学院、哈尔滨工业大学等的教授和专家们主动地到防汛指挥部，贡献出他们的技术特长。工程师们日日夜夜在江堤上检查险象。
    在这次短短的防汛斗争期间，涌现了一万六千多个防汛模范和三百多个防汛集体模范。他们创造了无数英勇、光辉的事迹。
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　29日晚，哈尔滨市人民举行庆祝战胜洪水大会和庆祝晚会。
    参加这个大会的有两万多人，全市三百三十二个防汛模范单位和一万六千四百八十四个防汛模范在大会上受到了哈尔滨市人民委员会的奖励。
    哈尔滨市副市长王化成在会上讲了话。他说，这次战胜洪水的胜利是巨大的，这证明哈尔滨市人民在共产党的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，团结一致具有战胜一切困难和一切自然灾害的无比力量。他指出，全市人民今后的任务是，继续发挥创造性的劳动，为弥补防汛斗争时期生产和工作受到的损失而努力，为完成各项社会主义建设任务而努力。
    今天，哈尔滨市街头挂灯结彩。入夜，全市灯光辉煌，各娱乐场所和十一个露天晚会剧场，接待了三十万参加防汛斗争的人民。
