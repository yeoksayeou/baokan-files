Over the past year, the "Bandung spirit" has had an increasingly broad impact, and the Chinese people are proud to have the Republic of Indonesia as such a friendly ally.

Liu Shaoqi said: The distinguished guests have come from afar to visit our country despite the intense summer heat. We believe that through this visit, mutual understanding and friendship will be further enhanced. Finally, he proposed a toast to the establishment of direct contact and the promotion of cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries, to the further development of friendly cooperation between China and Indonesia, to the promotion of the "Bandung spirit", to the further consolidation of peace in Asia and the world, and to the health of the Indonesian people and President Sukarno!

Speaker Sartono said at the banquet that we cannot find appropriate words to express our gratitude for tonight's hospitality. He conveyed the greetings of the Indonesian people, parliament, and President Sukarno to the Chinese people. He hoped that their visit would strengthen the friendship and cooperation between China and Indonesia, accelerate the pace of construction in both countries, and promote world peace.

Sartono said: This visit has allowed us to meet the leaders of China and witness the country's great construction. He said that China's many achievements fill us with infinite admiration.

Sartono continued, "I hope Chairman Liu Shaoqi can initiate the convening of a conference of parliaments of Asian and African countries." He proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders, to China's prosperity, and to the rapid growth of friendship between the people of China and Indonesia.
