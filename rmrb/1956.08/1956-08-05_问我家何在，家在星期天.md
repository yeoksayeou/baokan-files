I have a home that feels like I don't have one, and yet I do. On Sundays, I don't go to the park, or the temple fair, nor do I go to restaurants. In short, I don't go to places where there are crowds of people. Instead, I wait for my children to come home for a family reunion. We don't have time to see each other on weekdays, only Sundays are our reunion days.

Although my three children are already in their twenties and are all Communist Party members, in their father's eyes, they are forever children. Unfortunately, both my sons live far away from me.

My daughter comes home on Sundays, and I get up at five in the morning to line up at the Dongdan vegetable market to buy vegetables and meat.

My daughter often steps into my room with a quick pace. Even though it's only been a week since we last saw each other, it's as if she's been away from her parents for a long time. As soon as she enters, she immediately gets busy, sometimes reading letters from her brothers, sometimes helping her mother cook.

The green shade of the locust tree in the courtyard is our open-air kitchen. As usual, I light the stove, my mother is the cook, and my daughter picks, washes, and cuts vegetables, rinses rice, scales fish... various odd jobs. When the boiling oil sizzles in the pot, turning out a circle of yellow foam, and the fish pieces change from light red to golden brown, releasing a fragrant smell, my mother tells my daughter, "That's done." Sometimes she lets my daughter do it herself, with her mother guiding her by the side.

Sometimes, my eldest son comes from Jinan on official business, and if it happens to be Sunday, it becomes doubly lively and joyous. On the desk with two cracks, one half is covered with books, and the other half with bowls and plates of various sizes. The four of us sit around three sides of the table. Although it's crowded, it's very pleasant. Sometimes my daughter sees me sweating and puts down her chopsticks to fan me. Sometimes my mother puts a few pieces of yellow, wax-like beef tendon into my daughter's bowl. Once, my eldest child bit off a peeled apple from his father's hand. An adult in his twenties is really like a little baby. At times like this, images of my children learning to walk often flood my mind... Eating the food you make yourself with your own children, the taste is really better than eating Donglaishun's mutton hotpot in winter or Quanjude's roast duck in autumn.

Coincidentally, one Sunday, we received a letter from our third son in Wuchang, saying that a song he wrote was being rehearsed in the cultural troupe and would soon be performed... We were so happy that we let our food get cold.

On another occasion, we received a happy letter from our third son saying that he had a fiancée. She is studying at a Russian language school somewhere and is a good student and a Communist Party member. Enclosed was a photo of her with a People's Liberation Army symbol hanging on her chest, a round face, and two braids. We looked at the photo again and again. To welcome the future member of our family, the three of us squeezed into the crowd at the department store to pick out two pieces of floral shirt fabric to send to her. Soon after, we received a letter calling us Mom, Dad, and Sister. The letter was warm and fluent, and the writing was generous and beautiful. Our whole family was happy for several days.

My eldest son often gives us pleasant news as well. In early July, he wrote that he had been approved for promotion to captain before the prescribed time limit, which shows that he has always worked diligently. He will soon be transferred to Beijing. My third son wrote that he might come in August, perhaps with his fiancée... At that time, our Sunday will be a grand reunion.

    问我家何在，家在星期天
    洪滔
    我是有家似无家、无家又有家的。星期天，我不去逛公园，赶庙会，也不去吃饭馆，坐蒸笼，一句话我不到人山人海里去挤，而是等待孩子回来全家团圆。平时我们没工夫见面，只有星期天才是我们的团圆日子。
    三个孩子虽已二十多岁，都成共产党员了，但在爸爸眼里，他们永远是个孩子。可惜两个男孩子都离我很远。
    女儿星期天回来，我早晨五点多钟就到东单菜市排队买菜买肉。
    女儿经常以急速的步子踏进我的住室，虽只一周未见，却像离开父母很久似的，她一进门，马上就忙碌起来，有时看她哥哥弟弟的信，有时帮助母亲做饭。
    院里槐树的绿荫，是我们的露天厨房，照例我生火炉，母亲是炊事员，女儿摘菜、洗菜、切菜，淘米，剥鱼鳞……一些杂拌事儿。当沸油在锅里嗞嗞响，翻着一圈黄泡沫，鱼块从淡红变成焦黄放出一股香味的时候，母亲就告诉女儿说：“这就算透了。”有时也让女儿亲自动手作，母亲在旁边指导。
    有时候，大儿子因公从济南来，碰上星期天就加倍热闹欢快。上面有两条裂缝的书桌上，一半是书，另一半放着大大小小的菜碗和碟子，四个人围着桌子的三面坐下，虽然拥挤，却很愉快。有时女儿看我出汗了，便放下筷子给我扇扇子，有时母亲夹几块黄得像蜡似的牛腱筋，送到女儿碗里去；有一次大孩子从父亲手里咬去一只剥皮的苹果，二十多岁的成人真像小娃娃一样呢。在这种时候，我脑海里时时涌现出儿女学步时的情景……。同自己的儿女一块吃自己作的饭菜，其滋味实在比冬天吃东来顺的涮羊肉，秋天吃全聚德的烤肥鸭还香。
    凑巧有个星期天接到在武昌的三儿子的来信，说他写的一只歌曲正在文工团里排演，不久即可演出……，我们高兴得连饭都放冷了。
    又有一次接到三儿子一封喜信，他有了未婚妻。她在某地俄文专科学校学习，是个好学生，共产党员。附一张照片，她胸前挂着解放军符号，圆圆的脸，两个辫子。我们围着照片看了又看。为了向我们家的未来成员表示欢迎，我们三个人钻进百货大楼的人丛里给挑了两块花衬衣料寄了去，不久即接到一封称呼我们为爸爸妈妈姊姊的信，信写得亲热、流畅，字也写得大方、秀丽，我们合家高兴了几天。
    我的长子也常给我们愉快消息。七月初来信说，他未到规定年限就被批准晋级上尉了，这说明他一向勤勤恳恳地工作。他不久即可调京，三儿子有信八月间来，也许和他的未婚妻一道……，那时，我们的星期天就是大团圆了。
