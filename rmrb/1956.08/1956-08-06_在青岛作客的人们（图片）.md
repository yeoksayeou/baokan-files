Guests in Qingdao

This summer, more people than ever before have come to Qingdao as guests. International friends, foreign students, and working people from all over the country have arrived in Qingdao one after another.

The expanded bathing beach has received hundreds of thousands of people. Many events of the First Shandong Provincial Children's Games have attracted spectators. The Qingdao Sailing Club has also started classes, with approximately seven thousand young men and women participating in sailing activities. In various sanatorium areas, labor models, workers, experts, technicians, writers, and professors are enjoying pleasant vacations, preparing to meet future work with full energy.
