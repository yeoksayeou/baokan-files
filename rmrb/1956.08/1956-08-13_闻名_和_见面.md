    "Famed but not met, meeting has its limits." This saying contains a slight of, and disappointment with, celebrities.

    Before meeting, people blindly think that celebrities are "limitless." After meeting, they discover that they are "limited," and naturally feel greatly disappointed. Although there is slight and disappointment, the heart is not despaired. It still yearns for other celebrities who are only famed and not yet met, who are "unlimited." The "unlimited" celebrities are saints. What is this if not a personality cult? Hope, disappointment, disappointment, hope, are just spinning around in the circle of personality cult.

    Celebrities and experts have limited understanding of things, not only restricted by historical conditions, but also inevitably restricted by their professions. There are no "unlimited" saints. It is reasonable for celebrities to "have their limits."

    Before meeting celebrities, we don't need to imagine them as "unlimited." After meeting them, we don't need to be disappointed by their "limits." We don't need to slight them for saying a few unprofessional words. Instead, we should learn the knowledge within their "limits."

    Celebrities should also know the "limits" of their "limits." They shouldn't think that because they have become celebrities, they are "unlimited," to the point of "often saying the wrong thing" or even "always saying the wrong thing."

### “闻名”和“见面”

    “闻名”和“见面”
    康北海
    “闻名别见面，见面有其限”。这句话，包含对名人轻视和失望。
    未见面以前，盲目地认为名人是“无限的”，见了面之后发觉其“有限”，当然就会感到大失所望。虽然有轻视有失望，但心并没有绝望，仍向往着另外只闻名、未见面的“无其限”的名人。“无其限”的名人者，圣人也，这不是个人崇拜又是什么呢？希望、失望，失望、希望，只不过老是在个人崇拜的圈子里打转而已。
    名人、专家对于事物的认识是有限的，不仅受着历史条件的限制，而且还不能不受到专业的限制。“无其限”的圣人是没有的。名人“有其限”是合情合理的。
    我们对于名人，未见面前，不必空想他是“无其限”的；见面之后，也不必为他的“有其限”而失望；更不必因他说了几句行外话而轻视他；倒是应该学习他“有其限”之内的知识为是。
    名人也应该知道自己“有其限”的“限”；不要以为自己既成名人，就“无其限”了，以致弄到“出言多悖”、甚至“出言必悖”的地步。
