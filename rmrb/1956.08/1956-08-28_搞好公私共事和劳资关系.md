Improve Public-Private Cooperation and Labor-Management Relations

Sun Ding, Deputy Director of the Public-Private Joint Shanghai Xin'an Electric Motor Factory

What problems exist in public-private joint ventures? I believe there are two main ones: cooperation between the public and private parties, and the relationship between labor and management.

The relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures is complex. In addition to cooperation and class relations, there is also a relationship of leadership and being led because the public representative represents the government. To work well together in such a complex relationship requires efforts from both the public and private sectors, especially the understanding and mastery of the Party's policies.

Over the past few years, under the education of the Party, the vast majority of private industrialists and businessmen voluntarily accepted transformation. After the overall joint venture of industry and commerce, the production relations in enterprises have been fundamentally changed, and the private personnel have gradually changed their status as exploiters. This change is a positive factor and is conducive to the cause of socialist construction. However, many joint ventures have not paid enough attention to this positive factor. For example, in some factories, the reasonable opinions of private personnel are not valued, and private personnel do not take the initiative to fight for them; in some factories, the public and private sectors not only cannot get along well, but both sides are heavily guarded, and there is no question of open and honest communication; some public and private parties are polite all day long, but in reality, private personnel have nothing to do. All these phenomena are abnormal, and both the public and private sectors must take responsibility. Since the public sector is in a leading position, their requirements should be higher.

To improve the relationship between the public and private sectors, although the influence of public personnel is very large, private personnel cannot shirk their responsibilities. In his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, Vice Chairman Li Weihan asked private personnel to actively play a positive role, actively participate in production and management, strive to achieve results in their work, and take the initiative to approach public representatives and workers, and strive for their help and support with a sincere and frank attitude. May I ask, have we done this according to these instructions? I believe that the vast majority of private personnel lack this initiative. On the contrary, many private personnel only one-sidedly emphasize that the support and assistance of public representatives is not enough, which is incorrect.

Of course, the initiative of the private sector cannot be separated from the help and support of the public sector, and whether the public and private sectors can be open and honest is also inseparable from the enlightenment and encouragement of the public sector. Especially in the early days of the joint venture, private personnel often held the attitude of asking for instructions in everything and not making their own decisions. These phenomena stem from the gains and losses of the bourgeoisie's individualism, so it is not surprising; but if public representatives can give them support and trust, I believe that private personnel will change this attitude soon.

The public and private sectors must also establish appropriate working systems. In our enterprise, we have established a system of collective office work for both the public and private sectors and factory director's meetings. Because of the collective office work and frequent meetings, the private personnel have reduced a lot of concerns, and incorrect ideas can also be exposed, so as to better accept the help of the public representatives. As far as I know, many joint ventures have not yet established a system, so the division of labor is not clear, opinions cannot be unified, and both sides are somewhat depressed.

Private personnel play a part of the leadership role in the enterprise. When handling daily affairs, they have to contact the workers, so there is a problem of getting along between labor and management. Generally speaking, after the enterprise is jointly operated, the labor-management relationship has also improved, but in a few enterprises, the labor-management relationship is not normal enough. This abnormal situation existed before the joint venture, and this is worthy of the private personnel's deep self-examination. The experience of many joint factories proves that the main key to improving the labor-management relationship lies in the private personnel's sincere and frank attitude, actively striving for and approaching the workers; with a pragmatic spirit, diligently and conscientiously being loyal to their duties. If you do this, even if there are mistakes in the work, you will get the understanding of the workers.

Of course, it is a long-term matter to improve the cooperative relationship between labor and management. The trust of the labor side is gradually built on the attitude of the capital side to accept transformation and the achievements of the work. In my personal understanding, in all factories, mines, and enterprises where the labor-management relationship is not normal, private personnel should first conduct self-examination and must not adopt a confrontational mood, otherwise it will hinder their own transformation.

In short, the key to improving the cooperation between the public and private sectors and the labor-management relationship lies in the private personnel's ability to eliminate concerns, not be afraid of difficulties, and actively and consciously strive for the help of the public sector and the unity of the workers. At the same time, we require the public personnel to give appropriate estimates and reasonable support to the positive factors of the private personnel so that the private personnel can give full play to their strength in the enterprise.

### 搞好公私共事和劳资关系

    搞好公私共事和劳资关系
    公私合营上海新安电机厂副厂长　孙鼎
    在公私合营企业里究竟存在哪些问题？我认为主要的有两个，即公私双方共事问题和劳资双方的关系问题。
    合营企业里的公私之间关系是复杂的，除了合作共事和阶级关系而外，又因为公方代表是代表政府，因而存在领导与被领导的关系。在这样一个复杂的关系下共事，而又要共得好，那就有赖公私双方的努力，尤其是要求公私双方领会和掌握党的政策。
    几年来，私营工商业者在党的教育下，绝大多数自愿接受改造。工商业全面合营后，基本上改变了企业中的生产关系，私方人员也逐渐改变了剥削者的地位。这种改变是一种积极的因素，是有利于社会主义建设事业的。可是，目前还有许多合营企业，对于这种积极的因素没有重视起来。例如有些厂里私方人员的合理意见还不被重视，而私方人员也不主动争取；有些厂里，公私之间不仅不能融洽相处，而且双方戒备森严，更谈不上开诚相见了；有些公私双方终日客客气气，礼质彬彬，实际上私方人员无事可做。这一切现象是不正常的，公私双方都要负责，公方由于处于领导地位，对他们的要求也就要高一些了。
    搞好公私共事关系，公方人员的影响虽然很大，但私方人员也不能推卸责任。李维汉副委员长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言中，要求私方人员主动地发挥积极作用，努力参加生产经营，争取在工作中做出成绩，要我们主动地接近公方代表和工人群众，以真诚坦率的态度，争取他们的帮助和支持。试问，我们是否根据这些指示做到了呢？我认为，绝大部分私方人员缺乏这种主动的精神。相反地，许多私方人员只片面地强调公方代表支持和帮助不够，这是不正确的。
    当然，私方的主动性脱离不了公方的帮助和支持，公私之间能否开诚相见，也和公方的启发和鼓励分不开的。尤其在合营初期，私方人员往往抱着遇事请示，不作主张的态度。这些现象导源于资产阶级患得患失的个人主义，因此并不奇怪；但是公方代表如果能够给予他们支持和信任，我相信不久之后，私方人员就会改变这种态度。
    公私双方共处还必须要建立适当的工作制度。像在我们企业里，建立了公私双方集体办公和厂长碰头会的制度。由于集体办公，经常碰头，使私方人员减少了不少顾虑，不对头的思想也可以暴露出来，从而更好的来接受公方代表的帮助。据我所知，目前有许多合营企业还没有建立制度，因此分工不明确，意见无法统一，而双方又都有些苦闷。
    私方人员在企业中担任一部分领导工作，他们在处理日常事务时，要和职工群众接触，因而存在着劳资之间相处的问题。一般说，企业合营后，劳资关系也都随之好转，但也有少数企业的劳资关系还不够正常，这种不正常的情况在合营前就存在的，这一点是值得私方人员的深自检查，许多合营厂的经验证明，搞好劳资关系的主要关键在于私方人员要以真诚坦率的态度，主动地争取和接近职工群众；要以实事求是的精神，勤勤恳恳的忠于自己的职责。这样做，虽然在工作里有了错误，也会得到职工的谅解。
    当然，搞好劳资合作共事关系，是长期的事，劳方的信任是逐步建筑在资方接受改造的态度和工作的成绩上的。凡是劳资关系不正常的厂矿、企业，以我个人的领会是，私方人员应该首先进行自我检查，切不可采取对立的情绪，否则会阻碍了自己的改造。
    总之，搞好公私双方共事和劳资关系的关键在于私方人员能消除顾虑，不怕困难，主动地，自觉地，争取公方的帮助和职工的团结，同时我们要求公方人员对私方人员的积极因素，给予以适当估计，合理的支持，使私方人员在企业里充分发挥力量。
