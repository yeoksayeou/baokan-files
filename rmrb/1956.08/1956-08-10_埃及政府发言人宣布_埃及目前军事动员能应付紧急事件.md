Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 9th—An Egyptian government spokesman said on the evening of August 7th that the current military mobilization being carried out in Egypt will be fully capable of coping with any emergency.

United Press International said this was Egypt's response to the increased military threat from Britain and France due to Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

"Al-Ahram" wrote on August 8th that if Western countries use force against Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia will express their support for Egypt and cut off oil pipelines passing through their territories.

"Al-Gomhuria" said that all Arab countries believe that "the imperialist offensive against Egypt also threatens all Arab countries." The newspaper also said that the only explanation for the actions taken by Britain and France on the Suez Canal nationalization issue is that they intend "to re-establish an imperialist ruling system in the Middle East."

    埃及政府发言人宣布
    埃及目前军事动员能应付紧急事件
    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府的一个发言人八月七日晚间说：埃及目前进行的军事动员将完全能够应付任何紧急事件。
    合众社说，这是埃及对英国和法国因埃及把苏彝士运河收为国有而加强军事威胁的答复。
    “金字塔报”八月八日写道，如果西方国家对埃及使用武力的话，叙利亚、黎巴嫩和沙特阿拉伯将表示支持埃及，割断通过它们领土的油管。
    “共和国报”说，所有阿拉伯国家都认为：“帝国主义对埃及发动的攻势也威胁到所有阿拉伯国家”。这家报纸又说，英国和法国在苏彝士运河国有化问题上采取的行动的唯一的解释是，它们打算“要在中东重新建立帝国主义统治体系”。
