Xinhua News Agency, London, August 24th: Immediately after the twenty-two-nation London conference on the Suez Canal issue concluded on August 23rd, Western countries such as Britain, France, and the United States immediately engaged in intense activity, preparing to intensify pressure on Egypt.

One of the central activities of the Western countries is to arrange, according to the plan they announced at the closing session of the London conference, for the "Five-Nation Committee" composed of Australia, Ethiopia, Iran, Sweden, and the United States, selected by the seventeen countries that support Dulles's "internationalization" plan, to submit the Dulles plan to Egypt and negotiate directly with Egypt. As soon as the London conference ended, Australian Prime Minister Menzies held talks with Dulles, Pineau, and Lloyd. At the same time, the "Five-Nation Committee" also met at Lancaster House to discuss ways to deal with Egypt.

Echoing this ultimatum-like approach by the West, Britain and France are deliberately creating tension regarding the passage of ships through the canal.

Eden also convened a cabinet meeting for this purpose. Some British newspapers called this meeting an "emergency meeting" and revealed that the British cabinet was preparing to issue a serious "warning" to Egypt at an "appropriate time."

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who was originally scheduled to return home that day, reportedly decided to stay in London temporarily due to the "tense situation."

Britain and France are also stepping up military preparations. The British Admiralty announced on August 23rd that the Admiralty would continue to retain all naval personnel whose service period ends on or after September 1st. A British cruiser carrying marines and commandos sailed to the Mediterranean that evening. According to reports, the French 35,000-ton battleship "Jean Bart" has also sailed from Toulon to the Mediterranean for "shooting exercises." French General Raymond in Algeria has been recalled to Paris to preside over military preparations.

### 伦敦会议结束之后  西方国家准备加紧对埃及使用压力

    伦敦会议结束之后
    西方国家准备加紧对埃及使用压力
    据新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：八月二十三日二十二国讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议刚刚结束，英法美等西方国家立即进行紧张的活动，准备加紧对埃及使用压力。
    西方国家的中心活动之一是要按照它们在伦敦会议闭幕会上宣布的计划，安排通过支持杜勒斯“国际化”计划的十七个国家所推选的由澳大利亚、埃塞俄比亚、伊朗、瑞典和美国组成“五国委员会”，把杜勒斯计划提交埃及，并且同埃及直接谈判。伦敦会议一结束，澳大利亚总理孟席斯就和杜勒斯、比诺和劳埃德进行了会谈。同时，“五国委员会”也在兰开斯特大厦开会商讨了对付埃及的办法。
    与西方这种准备向埃及提出最后通牒式的做法相呼应的是，英法故意在运河通航情况方面制造紧张空气。
    艾登还为此召开了一次内阁会议。英国一些报纸把这次会议称为“紧急性会议”，并且透露，英国内阁准备在“适当的时候”向埃及提出严重“警告”。
    原定这一天回国的美国国务卿杜勒斯据说也因为“形势紧张”决定暂时留在伦敦。
    英法还在加紧进行军事准备工作。英国海军部八月二十三日宣布，海军部将继续留用服役期在九月一日或以后结束的全体海军人员。英国一艘载运海军陆战队和突击队的巡洋舰已经在当天晚上驶向地中海。据报道，法国一艘三万五千吨的战斗舰“让·巴尔号”也已经从土伦开往地中海去进行“射击演习”。在阿尔及利亚的法国将军雷蒙德已经被召回巴黎来主持军事准备工作。
