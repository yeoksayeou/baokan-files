    More Coverage of the Dynamics of Scientific Work
    Reader Kan Shipei wrote, believing that the newspaper has not fulfilled its due responsibility in promoting the "March towards Science." He suggested that the newspaper open several columns to report more on the dynamics of domestic and international scientific activities and new achievements in scientific work. Reporters should get closer to universities, scientific research institutions, and science popularization institutions to understand the situation and problems in scientific work. Zhang Tianjue wrote, saying that many professors and students in universities are highly motivated to study science and have made many achievements, but the newspaper rarely reflects this. Liu Chao Ying wrote, hoping that the newspaper will introduce more scientific knowledge.
    We agree with these opinions of our readers. In order to report more on the dynamics of scientific work, we hope that readers, especially scientific workers in various places, can give the newspaper editorial department their support and help, and regularly provide information and manuscripts in this regard.

    更多地报道科学工作的动态
    读者阚世培来信，认为报纸对于“向科学进军”的宣传，尚未尽到应尽的责任。他建议报纸辟出几个专栏，更多地报道国内外科学活动的动态和科学工作的新成就；记者应该多接近高等学校、科学研究机关和科学普及机关，了解科学工作中的情况和问题。张天爵来信说：现在高等学校的很多教授和学生，钻研科学的积极性是很高的，而且也有了不少成就，但是报纸上很少反映这方面的情况。刘超英来信，希望报纸多介绍一些科学知识。
    我们同意读者的这些意见。为了更多地报道科学工作的动态，希望读者、特别是各地的科学工作者，能够给报纸编辑部以支持和帮助，经常提供这方面的情况，供给这方面的稿件。
