Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 9th: The British colonial authorities in Cyprus executed three local patriotic youths this morning. This is the second time in less than three months that Cypriot patriotic youths have been murdered.
    On August 8, the Greek government formally issued a statement requesting the British authorities to postpone the execution of these people; the mayor of Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, and the leaders of Cypriots of Greek descent also issued the same request, but they were all blatantly rejected.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 10th: On August 9, 400,000 residents of Greek descent, accounting for four-fifths of the Cypriot population, held an island-wide general strike and market strike to protest the British colonial authorities' execution of three local patriotic youths that morning.
    Sources say that the general strike and market strike will last for four or five days.
    Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 10th: The Director of the Greek Prime Minister's Office, Kon. Tsatsos, on August 9, criticized the British authorities' execution of three Cypriot patriotic youths, saying that it made the Cyprus issue more difficult to resolve.
    According to the Associated Press, on the same day, the Greek Chief Representative to the United Nations, Palamas, also issued a statement in New York, condemning the British Governor of Cyprus, Harding, for "ruthlessly engaging in his bloody business." Palamas called on world public opinion to help resolve the Cyprus issue and demanded that the British people take action in this regard first.

    抗议英当局再次处死塞浦路斯爱国青年
    塞浦路斯希腊血统居民举行总罢工总罢市
    据新华社9日讯　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯英国殖民当局在今天清晨又处死了当地的三个爱国青年。这是在不到三个月的时间内第二次杀害塞浦路斯爱国青年。
    希腊政府八月八日曾正式发表声明，要求英国当局暂缓处决这些人；塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚的市长和希腊血统的塞浦路斯人的领袖也发出了同样的要求，但是都被悍然拒绝了。
    据新华社10日讯　尼科西亚消息：八月九日，占塞浦路斯居民五分之四的希腊血统居民四十万人举行全岛范围的总罢工和总罢市，抗议英国殖民当局在当天清晨处死三个当地爱国青年。
    有消息说，总罢工、总罢市将延续四、五天。
    据新华社10日讯　雅典消息：希腊总理办公厅主任康·察佐斯八月九日指责英国当局处死三个塞浦路斯爱国青年的作法使得塞浦路斯问题更难得到解决。
    据美联社报道，同一天，希腊驻联合国首席代表帕拉马斯也在纽约发表了声明，谴责英国驻塞浦路斯总督哈定“冷酷无情地从事他的血腥事业”。帕拉马斯吁请世界舆论协助解决塞浦路斯问题，并且要求英国人民在这方面首先采取行动。
