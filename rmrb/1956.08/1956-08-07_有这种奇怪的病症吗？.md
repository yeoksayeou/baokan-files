    Is There Such a Strange Disease?

    The People's Daily published a report on July 25th on page 3, entitled "Guangxi Animal Medicinal Liquor Sells Well in Southeast Asia," stating that these liquors "can treat diseases such as dispelling wind, removing dampness, and promoting blood circulation." People may ask: where did the diseases of "dispelling wind, removing dampness, and promoting blood circulation" come from? In fact, anyone with a little hygiene knowledge knows that these medicinal liquors have "functions" such as dispelling wind, removing dampness, and promoting blood circulation, but they cannot treat "dispelling wind, removing dampness, and promoting blood circulation diseases." We have never heard of such strange diseases. The editor's careless style is unacceptable. We hope that such avoidable mistakes will no longer be seen in newspapers and periodicals in the future.

    有这种奇怪的病症吗？
    人民日报七月二十五日第三版登载的“广西动物药酒畅销南洋”的报道内，说这些酒“能治如祛风、去湿、活血等病症”。人们要问：是从哪里传来的袪风、去湿、活血病呀？其实只要是稍有一些卫生常识的人，就会知道这些药酒是具有袪风、去湿、活血等“功能”，而并不是能治什么“袪风、去湿、活血等病症”，我们也从未听说过有这样的奇怪的病症。编者这种粗枝大叶的作风是要不得的。但愿今后在报刊上不再见到这样一些完全可以避免的错误。　（施仁政）
