Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 20th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama said on August 19th, "If my health permits, I am prepared to go to Moscow to negotiate with Soviet leaders in order to break the deadlock in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations."

Prior to this, the leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party held a meeting on August 18th to discuss the issue of breaking the deadlock in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Ichiro Kono, who had gone to Moscow to sign the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty, informed Hatoyama of the results of the meeting on the 19th. Hatoyama made the statement about his willingness to go to Moscow at that time to Kono. Kono will explain Prime Minister Hatoyama's intention at the ruling party leaders' meeting to be held on the 21st and seek opinions within the ruling party.

The Soviet-Japanese negotiations held in Moscow between Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov have once again been interrupted last week due to the Japanese side's insistence on demanding the transfer of the Soviet territories of Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island to Japan. This has attracted great attention from Japanese public opinion.

Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi said on August 20th regarding Hatoyama's reason for going to Moscow: "Achieving an agreement in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations is Hatoyama's biggest promise in diplomacy, and he very much wants to be responsible for completing this negotiation himself."

According to Kyodo News Agency today, the majority of people within the Japanese ruling party agree with Hatoyama going to Moscow, with only a small number of people, such as the pro-American Yoshida faction, expressing disagreement. However, most people believe that a formal decision should be made after Shigemitsu returns to the country, listens to his report on the situation of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, and understands the attitudes of the United States and other countries.

Japan Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki commented on Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union yesterday, saying that he "agrees in principle." He said that he had long believed that this autumn was the most important juncture in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations and hoped that Prime Minister Hatoyama would personally visit the Soviet Union. Suzuki pointed out that Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union and Shigemitsu's return to the country seem to be related to party infighting.

### 为了打开苏日谈判僵局  鸠山表示愿到莫斯科

    为了打开苏日谈判僵局
    鸠山表示愿到莫斯科
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎八月十九日说：“如果健康情况允许的话，我准备到莫斯科去，同苏联首脑进行谈判，以打开日苏谈判的僵局。”
    在这以前，执政的自由民主党首脑曾经在八月十八日举行会议，讨论打开苏日谈判的僵局问题。曾经到莫斯科签订苏日渔业条约的河野一郎在十九日把会议的结果告诉了鸠山。鸠山表示准备到莫斯科去的谈话就是这时向河野说的。河野将在二十一日举行的执政党首脑会议上说明首相鸠山的这种意图，并且征求执政党内部的意见。
    日本外务相重光和苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在莫斯科举行的苏日谈判，由于日本方面坚持要求把苏联领土国后岛和择捉岛移交给日本，已经在上星期又告中断。这引起日本舆论很大的注意。
    日本自由民主党干事长岸信介在八月二十日谈到鸠山要去莫斯科的原因说：“使日苏谈判达成协议是鸠山在外交上的最大的诺言，他很想由自己负责完成这个谈判。”
    据共同社今天报道，日本执政党内部大多数人赞成鸠山去莫斯科，只有亲美的吉田派等一小部分人表示不赞同。不过，大多数人认为要等到重光回国，听取了他的关于日苏谈判情况的报告和了解了美国等国的态度以后再正式作出决定。
    日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎昨天曾就鸠山访苏一事发表谈话说：他“在原则上是赞成的”。他说，他老早就认为今年秋天是日苏谈判的最重要关头，并且希望鸠山首相亲自访苏。铃木指出，现在鸠山访苏和重光回国好像同党内的纠纷有关。
