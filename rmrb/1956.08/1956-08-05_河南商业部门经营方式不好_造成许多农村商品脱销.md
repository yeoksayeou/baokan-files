Zhengzhou Dispatch from our newspaper: Recently, a widespread shortage of goods has occurred in rural areas throughout Henan Province. Among the goods out of stock are fertilizers, pesticides, small farm tools, as well as various summer daily necessities, cultural supplies, and general merchandise. According to statistics from fourteen grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in twelve counties, the number of goods out of stock generally ranges from fifty to one hundred. In Yiyang County, the number of goods out of stock exceeds one hundred throughout the county.

The reasons for the large-scale shortage of goods, in addition to the heavy rainstorms that occurred throughout the province in June, which caused water accumulation in some areas, obstructing transportation and affecting the timely transfer and distribution of materials, are mainly problems with the supply work of the commercial departments. The Tantou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Luanchuan County has been out of cooking oil for nearly a month. Instead of trying to organize supplies, they persuaded the masses to conserve oil, while this supply and marketing cooperative failed to meet its cooking oil sales targets month after month. In particular, the commodities distributed by state-owned companies are not marketable, and the variety is small. At the same time, they restrict supply and marketing cooperatives from purchasing goods from other places in many ways. For example, the varieties and colors of calico in the Fugou County Textile Company are incomplete. When the supply and marketing cooperative went to Weishi County to purchase goods, they encountered obstacles. Similar situations exist in many counties. In addition, the coordination between regions has not been done well, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as stockpiles in one place and shortages in another, as well as local production being out of stock locally. For example, the sickles produced by the Hui County Handicraft Cooperative were transported to Qinyang County for sale. As a result, Qinyang County imported too much and they were stockpiled, while farmers in Hui County could not buy them.

The peak season for the rural market is about to arrive. Commercial departments in Henan Province must quickly find ways to change this situation of shortages.

    河南商业部门经营方式不好
    造成许多农村商品脱销
    本报郑州电　最近河南省各地农村普遍发生商品脱销现象。脱销商品中，有肥料、农药和小件农具，以及各种夏季日用、文化用品和百货。据十二个县的十四个基层供销社统计，脱销商品一般都在五十至一百种。伊阳县全县范围内脱销商品则在一百种以上。
    造成大批商品脱销原因，除了六月份全省普降暴雨，部分地区积水使交通受阻，影响物资及时调运和下放外，主要是商业部门的供应工作有问题。栾川县潭头供销社食油脱销近一个月，他们不想法组织货源，却说服群众要节约用油，而这个供销社却月月没有完成食油销售任务。特别是国营公司分配的商品不适销，品种又少，同时又多方限制供销社到外地进货。例如扶沟县纺织品公司花布品种花色不全，供销社去尉氏县进货，就遇到了阻碍，类似的情况在许多县都有。另外，地区和地区之间没有做好调剂工作，造成甲地积压，乙地脱销，以及当地生产当地脱销等不合理现象。像辉县手工业社生产的镰刀运到沁阳县销售，结果沁阳县进货过多积压起来，而辉县农民却买不到。
    农村市场的旺季就要来到，河南省商业部门要迅速设法改变这种脱销局面。
