    Let Domestic Drawing Paper Meet Those Who Need It
    A reader mentioned in the People's Daily's "Reader's Letters" column that they couldn't buy drawing paper. As a paper manufacturing worker, I would like to say a few words about this issue. Since 1955, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau has attached great importance to the trial manufacture of various new types of paper for national defense, industrial, and civilian use. Among the eight new products successfully trial-produced in the first half of this year were several important cultural papers such as tracing paper, drawing paper, and stencil paper. After appraisal, these new types of paper fully meet the usage requirements, and the cost is more than half cheaper than imported goods. It is only because the commercial departments have not actively operated these domestic papers that it is not easy to buy them on the market, and the paper industry departments cannot organize large-scale production. For example, some places reported that crepe paper needed for paper flower workshops and student manual work is not easy to buy. However, the various colored crepe papers made by the Shanghai Paper Company in the first half of the year, although the quantity was small, still experienced stockpiling. For example, we can manufacture various types of cardboard with different hardness, such as Manila cardboard, but handicraft production cooperatives specializing in making packaging boxes often use flour to glue several thin cardboard sheets together and then mount a layer of white paper because they cannot buy thick cardboard. This wastes both food and labor.
    In order to meet various social needs, and to save foreign exchange, in addition to the paper industry departments continuing to trial-produce a variety of new products, it is hoped that commercial departments will vigorously operate, so that various domestic papers can meet those who need them.

    让国产绘图纸同需要者见面
    人民日报读者来信栏内曾有读者提到买不到绘图纸，作为一个造纸工作者，我想对这个问题讲几句话。从1955年以来，造纸工业管理局就重视了国防用的、工业用的和民用的各种新品种纸张的试制工作。在今年上半年试制成功的八种新产品中，就有描图纸，绘图纸，字模板纸等几种重要的文化用纸。经过鉴定，这些新品种纸张完全符合使用条件，而且成本比进口货便宜一半还多。只因为商业部门没有积极经营这些国产纸张，不但市场上不容易买到，造纸工业部门也不能组织大批生产。如有些地方反映，纸花作坊和学生手工作业需要的皱纹纸不容易买到。可是上半年上海造纸公司制成的各种采色皱纹纸，尽管数量很少，却还发生了积压现象。又如各种不同硬度的草纸板，如马尼拉纸板，我们都可以制造，但是专制包装纸盒的手工业生产合作社，却常因为买不到厚纸板而用面粉把几张薄纸板粘在一起再裱上一层白纸。这样既浪费粮食，又浪费人工。
    为了满足社会上各种不同的需要，为了节省外汇，除了造纸工业部门应该继续试制多种新产品以外，还希望商业部门大力经营，使国产各种纸张同需要者见面。
