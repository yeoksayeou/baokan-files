    Nanping-Fuzhou Railway Under Full Construction
    Surveying Completed on Urumqi to Border Section

    Xinhua News Agency report: The military personnel and civilian laborers building the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway are braving the summer heat of the south and stepping up construction along the entire line. The roar of numerous road-building machines and the sound of blasting mountains resonate through the valleys day and night. The first tunnel is expected to be completed by mid-September. The Minjiang River Bridge is the largest bridge project on the entire line, and the piers have already been built above the water surface before the arrival of the flood season.

    Laborers from all over Fujian are working hard to cut mountain slopes and fill roadbeds along the line. In the green hills and valleys through which the Minjiang River flows, the wide road surface is rapidly extending forward.

    Xinhua News Agency report: The surveying of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway from Urumqi to the border section has been completed, and field staff are returning to Urumqi to organize data.

    The section from Urumqi to Alataw Pass on the border is 467 kilometers long. Due to the work method of one reconnaissance, two designs, and on-site alignment selection followed by final surveying, the final surveying work was shortened by one year compared to the original plan. When surveying this section of the line, the surveyors carried out a socialist competition and completed the revised predetermined final survey work seven days ahead of schedule.

    南平——福州铁路全线施工
    乌鲁木齐到国境一段铁路定测完毕
    据新华社讯　修建南平——福州铁路的军工和民工们，正冒着南方的炎夏，在全线加紧施工。大量筑路机械的轰鸣声和开山的爆破声日夜震撼着山谷。第一座隧道预计可在九月中旬打通。闽江大桥是全线最大的桥梁工程，早在洪水到来之前，桥墩已经筑出水面。
    来自福建各地的民工们，正在沿着线路加紧劈削山坡，填平路基。在闽江流经的青山翠谷中，宽阔的路面迅速向前延伸。
    据新华社讯　兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路从乌鲁木齐到国境段定测完毕，野外工作人员陆续回到乌鲁木齐市整理资料。
    从乌鲁木齐到国境阿拉山口段长四百六十七公里，由于采用一次勘测、两次设计和在现场选线以后定测的工作方法，定测工作较原计划缩短一年时间。定测人员在定测这段线路时，开展社会主义竞赛，又提前七天完成了修改后的预定完成定测的工作。
