Suggestion

	Don't Catch Frogs
	In the past, there was a custom in Xia邑 County, Henan Province: some people made a sideline out of selling frog meat. Every autumn and summer, they would go to ponds and rivers to catch frogs, process them, and sell them at the market. Frogs eat a lot of pests, and we should protect them. I suggest that local leading organs educate farmers not to treat catching frogs as a sideline anymore. Cheng Pixian

	Frogs often live in the fields and eat pests that harm crops. They are beneficial to crops. I passed through Yichang City, Hubei Province, and every day I saw people carrying skinned frogs (about ten or so catties each day) and selling them along the street. If this continues for a long time, it will gradually increase the reproduction of pests and reduce agricultural income. I suggest that relevant agricultural departments should educate the masses not to kill frogs.

    不要捉青蛙
    过去我们河南省夏邑县有一种习惯：有些人把卖青蛙肉当一种副业。每年秋夏，他们都跑到池边河边去捉青蛙，经加工后，到集市上出售。青蛙能吃掉很多害虫，我们应当加以保护。我建议各地领导机关教育农民，不要再把捕捉青蛙当作副业。　程丕显
    青蛙常居住在田间捕吃危害农作物的害虫，它们对农作物是有益的。我路过湖北省的宜昌市，每天都看到有人提着剥了皮的青蛙（每天约有十来斤左右）沿街走卖。这样长期下去，就会逐渐增加害虫的繁殖，减少农作物的收入。我建议有关农业部门应教育群众，不要捕杀青蛙。
