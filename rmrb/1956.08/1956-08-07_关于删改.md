	On Editing
	Ma Qianzu
	I remember the late writer Yu Dafu once modified a common saying, "A son is always dearest to his father," to read, "An article is always dearest to its writer." If this is interpreted as meaning that one's own article is the best in the world, it would naturally be considered arrogant.

	However, when a writer is writing an article, he racks his brains, exhausts his energy, and painstakingly manages the process, much like a pregnant woman before childbirth. After he has finished writing, he reads it over and over again, repeatedly adding and deleting, correcting what is incomplete and supplementing what is missing, hoping that it will move the readers' hearts when it is published. This is similar to a mother carefully nurturing her child, hoping that he will become a useful person. It is only natural for a writer to cherish his own article.

	But in recent years, the trend of newspapers and book publishers arbitrarily deleting and revising articles has become quite popular. It is said that one newspaper invited a famous writer to write an article, and after it was published, it was completely unrecognizable, with only two sentences left unchanged, and those were quotations from others. Yet the writer's name was still signed under the title of the article, so it seems that the writer still had to take responsibility for it. There is also a certain publishing house that summarized its experience in editing work and came up with a famous couplet: "The writer's brain, the editor's pen." It seems that there was once a joke about "cutting the feet to fit the shoes," but now there is the reality of "cutting the head to fit the pen." But the head cannot be cut, even if the editor picks up the pen and proclaims himself the hero, shouting loudly, "My pen is like a knife," the writer still shakes his head and says thank you: "I'm very sorry, you have your pen, and I love my head."

	I think the reason why our current writing style is so "dry" is partly due to the editors who wield their pens like knives.

	But this is not to say that editors do not have the right to choose and offer opinions on writers' articles. This "right" still exists. The problem lies in arbitrary deletion and revision. It is not necessarily more elegant to change "girl" to "young girl"; it is not necessarily more vivid to change "does not help" to "is not useful." Writing is like the person, and the style of writing is the expression of the writer's personality. I don't think it should be deleted or revised.

	Writing this, I thought of an old joke. It is said that a scholar from Shaoxing, when discussing the articles of the world, said: "The articles of the world, Zhejiang is the best; the articles of Zhejiang, Shaoxing is the best; the articles of Shaoxing, my elder brother's are the best; and even my elder brother's articles sometimes have to be deleted and revised by me!" Perhaps some editors who like to delete and revise other people's articles have the same mentality as this scholar from Shaoxing.

    关于删改
    马前卒
    记得已故作家郁达夫，曾经把俗语里“儿子是自己的好”改了一改，叫做“文章是自己的好”。这如果理解为天下文章只有自己的最好。那自然不免狂妄了。
    但作家写文章，当他没有写成之前，搔手苦思，呕心沥血，惨淡经营，确实有比之于孕妇临盆之前的情况。当他写成之后，回环低诵，返复增删，修其不整，补其不全，希望发表出去，能够打动读者的心，这又同母亲加意培育自己孩子，希望成个器材的心境是一个样的。作家珍爱自己的文章，也是人之常情。
    可是近年来，有些报刊和书籍出版社，任意删改文章的风气颇为流行。据说，有一家报纸，约请一位名作家写了一篇文章，登出之后，面目全非，仅有两句未改，那是引用别人的话。而文章标题之下，依然署那位作家的名字，看来文责还须那位作家来负的。还有某出版社，总结了编辑工作的经验，得名句一联：“作家的头脑，编辑的笔”，这么说来，自古有“削足适履”的笑话，而今有“削头就笔”的事实了。但头是削不得的，那怕编辑拿起笔来，自我称雄，高声叫道：“我有笔如刀”，然而作家还是摇头称谢：“对不起得很，你有你的笔，我爱我的头。”
    我想，我们目前的文章风格之所以如此“干巴巴的”，某些执笔如刀的编辑是出了一把力的。
    但这并不是说，编辑对作家的文章没有取舍和提意见之权，这个“权”还是有的。问题是在于任意删改，一定要把“姑娘”改做“少女”，未必文雅；一定要把“无济于事”改做“没什么用处”，也未必传神，文如其人，文章的风格也就是作家的个性的表现，我以为是删改不得的。
    写到这里，想到一个老笑话。据说有个绍兴文人论到天下的文章的时候，说道：“天下的文章，要算浙江；浙江的文章，要算绍兴；绍兴的文章，要算家兄；而家兄的文章，有时还得由我删改删改！”大概爱好删改别人的文章的某些编辑，是同这位绍兴文人的心理一样的。
