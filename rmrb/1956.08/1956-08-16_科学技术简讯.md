    New Type of Quartz Clock

    The Clock Laboratory of the Soviet Institute of Metrology and Measuring Instruments has developed a new type of quartz clock. This clock is well suited for use in observatories, radio factories, and physics laboratories. The new clock is small in size, and its price is only one-five-hundredth of that of a typical quartz clock.

    The biggest advantage of this clock is that the clock's "pendulum" is replaced by a quartz tuning fork instead of a quartz crystal. The vibration frequency of the quartz tuning fork is 1,000 cycles per second, which simplifies the structure of the frequency division section. The oscillator is powered by a storage battery, and the electron tube is replaced by a semiconductor—a germanium triode. The current output by the quartz oscillator can be used to supply synchronous motors for counting seconds and minutes.

    "Baby" Airplane

    The French Potez factory has manufactured the world's smallest airplane, with wingspans of approximately only five meters. This airplane can be stored in a medium-sized room and looks somewhat like a child's toy. However, this airplane can reach speeds of up to 500 kilometers per hour and can fly as high as 8,500 meters.

    This aircraft's performance is due to its use of jet engines and delta wings. The official name of this aircraft is "PA-49," but people call it the "Baby" airplane.

    Shortening Plant Germination and Growth Time

    Romanian scientists have researched a method for shortening plant germination and growth time. They use short radio waves to process moist seeds. Because the radio waves not only heat the seeds but also change the structure and metabolism of the plant, the seeds germinate as a result.

    This method has yielded good results for maize and sunflowers. Scientists are studying the plant growth after trial planting of seeds treated with this method. In addition, they will use ultrasonic waves and X-rays to treat seeds.

    Diamond Electron Tubes

    In the Union of South Africa, some engineers have made several diamond semiconductor electron tubes after conducting interesting experiments on several diamond crystals.

    Most diamonds are non-conductive, but only a few diamonds have semiconducting properties when the temperature is slightly raised. Scientists have discovered in experiments that several types of diamonds, including blue diamonds, can be used as rectifiers. As a result, engineers have used them to make the first batch of these electron tubes. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新型石英钟
    苏联的度量衡和测量仪器科学研究所时计试验室制成了一种新型石英钟。这种钟很适合天文台、无线电工厂和物理实验室使用。新钟的体积很小，它的价格只相当于一般石英钟的五百分之一。
    这种钟的最大优点是钟的“摆”不是用石英片，而是用石英叉来代替。石英叉的振动频率为每秒一千周，可以简化减频部分的结构。振荡器的电源是蓄电池，电子管用半导体——锗三极管来代替。石英振荡器输出的电流可以供应计分秒的同步电动机之用。
    “婴儿”飞机
    法国帕英工厂制造了一种世界上最小的飞机，它的翅膀大约只有五公尺。这种飞机可以放在中等大小的房间里，看来有些像小孩的玩具，但是，这种飞机的速度可以达到每小时五百公里，而且能够飞高到八千五百公尺的天空。
    这种飞机之所以有这样的性能，是因为采用了喷气发动机和三角形机翼。这种飞机的正式名称是“PA—四九”，但是人们叫它作“婴儿”飞机。
    缩短植物发芽和生长时间
    罗马尼亚科学家研究出了一种缩短植物发芽和生长时间的方法。他们用电短波来加工处理湿润的种子。由于电波不仅使种子受到热，也使植物的结构和新陈代谢发生变化，结果种子就发了芽。
    这种方法对玉蜀黍和向日葵有良好的结果。科学家们正在研究用这种方法处理的种子试种以后植物生长的情况。此外，他们还要用超声波和爱克斯光来处理种子。
    金刚石电子管
    在南非联邦，有一些工程师在对几种金刚石结晶体进行了有趣的实验后，已经制成了几个金刚石半导体电子管。
    大部分金刚石是不导电的，只有几种金刚石在温度稍为提高的情况下，具有半导体的特性。科学家们在实验中发现几种金刚石，其中包括蓝色金刚石，可以用来作整流器。这样，工程师们就用它们制成了第一批这种电子管。（新华社）
