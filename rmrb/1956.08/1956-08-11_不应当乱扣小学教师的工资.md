    Elementary School Teachers' Salaries Should Not Be Deducted Arbitrarily
    Hong Zhongzhe
    Recently, many readers have written to reflect that in Huaining County, Anhui Province, Qingfeng, Wuzhi, Xiuwu, and Tongbai counties in Henan Province, and parts of Shanxi and Sichuan Provinces, educational administrative departments deduct elementary school teachers' salaries because some elementary schools cannot collect enough student fees. In some places in Shanxi, even sick teachers are not spared from having their salaries deducted.
    These unreasonable phenomena of educational administrative departments arbitrarily deducting elementary school teachers' salaries have seriously affected teachers' lives and teaching. Under the threat of salary deductions, many teachers rush to prepare lessons during the day and rush to villages to collect student fees in the evening, often returning to school late at night, lacking both rest time and the ability to prepare lessons well. This not only affects teachers' physical health but also makes it impossible to improve the quality of teaching. After many teachers' salaries are deducted, they cannot solve their living problems, and some teachers' families even run out of food.
    In order to develop primary school education and tap the potential of the masses, it is necessary to appropriately collect tuition fees within the scope of the national primary school education funds. Collecting tuition fees from students' families should be a matter for the school administration. The task of teachers is mainly teaching. It is already unreasonable to ask teachers to complete the task of collecting tuition fees, but it is even more unreasonable for educational administrative departments in some areas to deduct teachers' salaries on the grounds that teachers cannot collect enough student fees.
    We hope that the educational administrative departments in these areas will quickly take measures to stop the practice of arbitrarily deducting elementary school teachers' salaries, and also to reissue the previously deducted salaries to help teachers overcome their living difficulties. In this way, teachers can concentrate on teaching and better complete their teaching tasks.

    不应当乱扣小学教师的工资
    洪钟哲
    最近，许多读者来信反映，在安徽省怀宁县，河南省清丰、武陟、修武、桐柏等县，山西省和四川省的部分地区教育行政部门，因为有的小学校收不齐学生学杂费，就扣去小学教师工资。山西省有的地方，甚至有病的教师也无例外地被扣去了工资。
    这些教育行政部门乱扣小学教师工资的不合理现象，已经严重地影响了教师的生活和教学。许多教师在扣工资的威胁下，白天赶功课，晚上还要到各村庄奔走，催收学杂费，往往深夜才回校，既缺乏休息的时间，也不能很好备课。这样不但影响了教师的身体健康，也无法提高教学质量。许多教师的工资被扣掉以后，生活问题无法解决，有的教师家中甚至断炊。
    为了发展小学教育，发挥群众潜力，在国家确定的小学教育经费范围内，适当地征收学杂费是必要的。向学生的家庭收学杂费，应当是学校行政方面的事情。教师的任务主要是教学，把收学杂费的任务叫教师去完成，本来就不太合理，而有些地区的教育行政部门却以教师收不齐学生学杂费为借口扣掉教师的工资，更是没有任何道理的。
    我们希望这些地区的教育行政部门赶快采取措施，停止乱扣小学教师工资的行为，并且要补发以前所扣的工资，帮助教师克服生活困难。这样，才可以使教师安心教学，更好地完成教学任务。
