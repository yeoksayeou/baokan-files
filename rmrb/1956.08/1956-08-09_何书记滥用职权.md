    Not long ago, Secretary He of the former Chengji District Committee of the Yongcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province, led a study session for party member cadres on the "Eight Requirements of a Communist Party Member's Standards." During this session, a heated debate unfolded regarding the nature of the Party. At the time, a comrade named Hou Shouti raised some differing opinions to Secretary He's statements. Logically, when encountering differing opinions during study and discussion, leaders should encourage everyone to speak freely, and improve understanding through debate. However, Secretary He not only failed to do so, but instead believed that "Hou Shouti is making the leader look bad," "deliberately being mischievous," and was simply "resisting leadership." Thereupon, he immediately announced the termination of Hou Shouti's party membership and the dismissal of his administrative position.
    People can't help but ask: When Secretary He was leading party members in studying the eight requirements of the standards for party members, why didn't he examine himself in light of reality to see if he met the eight requirements himself? Judging from Secretary He's behavior, he clearly did not do so. Otherwise, how could he be so unable to listen to different opinions, how could he so casually terminate a party member's membership, and how could he so arbitrarily dismiss a cadre's administrative position?

    何书记滥用职权
    不久以前，原中共河南省永城县城集区委何书记，在领导党员干部学习“共产党员标准八项条件”的时候，对党的性质问题展开了热烈的争论。当时有个叫侯守体的党员同志，对何书记的发言提出了一些不同的意见。按说：在学习讨论中，遇到分歧意见，领导上就应该让大家大胆发言，从争论中提高认识，可是何书记不仅没有这样做，反而认为：“侯守体给领导人找难看”，“故意调皮”，简直是“反抗领导”。于是当场宣布停止侯守体的党籍，撤销了他的行政职务。
    人们不禁要问：何书记在领导党员学习党员标准八项条件时，为什么不联系实际检查一下，自己究竟具备了八项条件没有？从何书记的行为来看，显然没有这样做。否则，怎么会这样不能听取不同的意见，怎么会这样随便停止一个党员的党籍，怎么会这样擅自撤销一个干部的行政职务？
