Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 27th: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce report published in the August issue of "Current Business," American capitalists earned a huge profit of $3.1 billion from foreign investments in 1955, an increase of 20% compared to 1954.

Of this profit, more than $2.8 billion came from direct investments—such as branches and factories established overseas by American companies, as well as oil drilling equipment. The remaining $260 million came from dividends and interest on foreign securities held by Americans and interest on private loans.

American capitalists transferred the vast majority of the profits earned—$2.23 billion—from the local areas back to their own country, while only a small portion—$870 million—was retained abroad for reinvestment.

The Department of Commerce report also stated that new U.S. investment abroad reached a record high of $2.5 billion in 1955, bringing the total investment to $29 billion by the end of that year.

    美国资本家在国外攫取巨额利润
    去年一年赚了三十一亿美元
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：据8月份“商业现况”发表的美国商务部的报告，1955年美国资本家从国外投资中赚得三十一亿美元的巨额利润，比1954年增加20％。
    这笔利润中有二十八亿多美元来自直接的投资——例如美国公司在海外设立的分公司、工厂以及石油钻探设备。其余二亿六千万美元是从美国人握有的外国证券的红利和利息以及私人贷款的利息中得到的。
    美国资本家把绝大部分赚得的利润——二十二亿三千万美元从当地抽走，汇回本国，而仅仅把一小部分——八亿七千万美元保留在国外用于再投资。
    商务部的报告还说，1955年美国在国外的新增加的投资达到二十五亿美元的最高纪录，到同年年底，投资总额达到二百九十亿美元。
