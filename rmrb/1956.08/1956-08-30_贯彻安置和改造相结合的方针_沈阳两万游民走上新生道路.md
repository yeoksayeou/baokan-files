    Implementing the Policy of Combining Resettlement and Transformation
    20,000 Vagrants in Shenyang Embark on a New Path
    (Our Newspaper) Shenyang City's reform-through-labor and relief departments, adhering to the policy of "combining resettlement and transformation," have guided over 20,900 vagrants left over from the old society, including hooligans, prostitutes, swindlers, and various other types of vagrants, onto a new path, transforming them into new people. According to statistics, among these 20,900 vagrants, more than 3,600 have been placed in employment, some becoming workers, others becoming farmers. More than 800 have become workers in factories affiliated with the Shenyang City Branch of the China National Relief Association. Over 10,000 people, after studying, have returned to their hometowns to participate in labor production. Many of them have married, had children, and established happy families.
    When these transformed individuals initially began laboring and producing at the Anpingzhen Quarry, they were once regarded by the local masses as a group of people who were fond of eating and averse to work. Now, everyone's views have changed. This April, the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative near Anpingzhen caught fire. All the quarry workers spontaneously went to rescue the situation and afterward helped the disaster-stricken masses clear the debris and rebuild their houses. They also donated more than 1,000 yuan from their labor income to help the disaster-stricken masses solve their livelihood problems. These actions deeply moved the surrounding masses. Now their relationship with the masses is getting better and better. (Xun Hua)

    贯彻安置和改造相结合的方针
    沈阳两万游民走上新生道路
    本报讯　沈阳市的教养和救济部门，按照“安置与改造相结合”的方针，已将旧社会遗留下来的两万零九百多名流氓、娼妓、骗子手等各种各样的游民引上了新生的道路，被改造成为新人。据统计，这两万零九百多名游民中，有三千六百多人被介绍就业，有的成了职工，有的成了农民。有八百多人成了中国人民救济总会沈阳市分会所属工厂的工人。有一万多人经过学习后回到了家乡参加劳动生产，他们之中很多人结了婚，有了孩子，建立了幸福的家庭。
    这些被改造的人，开始在安平镇采石场劳动生产的时候，曾被当地群众看做是一群好吃懒做的人。现在，大家的看法也改变了。今年四月，安平镇附近的胜利农业生产合作社失了火，全场工人自动前往抢救，事后又帮助受灾群众清理火后废墟，重建房舍。他们还从自己劳动所得的收入当中捐出了一千多元，帮助受灾群众解决生活上的困难。他们这些行动使周围的群众极为感动。现在他们和群众的关系越来越好了。　　（勋华）
