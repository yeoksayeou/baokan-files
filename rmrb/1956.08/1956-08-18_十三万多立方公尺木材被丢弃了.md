	More Than 130,000 Cubic Meters of Timber Discarded

	Since its establishment in 1950, the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau, under the Yichun Forest Industry Administration, has discarded large quantities of timber in the forest areas every year, allowing it to be weathered and damaged. According to statistics, as of August 1955, the total amount of discarded timber was more than 130,000 cubic meters. Most of this discarded timber has already undergone four processes: felling, selection, small-scale concentration, and hoisting, with wages alone for these four processes amounting to more than 870,000 yuan. Although some of these long-term discarded timbers have decayed, most are still usable. For example, among the more than 40 cubic meters of timber discarded in the Xiangyang Logging Area, more than 51% is usable, including 15.2% that is graded as first-class material. In the Lao Yulin Logging Area, 62% of the more than 20 cubic meters of timber discarded by three timber teams also has usable value.

	However, the serious issue is that the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau is not considering how to transport these discarded timbers down the mountain but is instead constantly contemplating how to create "reasons" to "write them off" on the spot. In the second quarter of this year, Gao Kai, the head of the Timber Section, and Yang Jing, the head of the Finance Section, of the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau, led more than 60 cadres to the timber storage yard to count the timber, precisely to "ascertain the numbers in order to write them off." The Yichun Forest Industry Administration did not carefully verify the "reasons" reported by the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau for the write-offs and simply forwarded the official document to the Ministry of Forestry (the Ministry of Forest Industry had not yet been established at that time). Although the relevant units of the Ministry of Forestry had repeatedly requested the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau to report in detail the reasons for the discarding, they did not investigate to the end, and as a result, the write-offs were still approved in a muddled manner.

	Recently, under the urging of the National Forestry Supervisory Bureau, the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau has formulated specific measures to prevent the discarding of timber and has required each logging area to create a plan to clean up the timber discarded in the forest areas over the past few years. However, based on past experience, simply making plans is not enough. To minimize the loss of this batch of timber, we urge the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau to transport it down the mountain as quickly as possible.　Shulin

### 十三万多立方公尺木材被丢弃了

    十三万多立方公尺木材被丢弃了
    伊春森林工业管理局所属乌敏河森林工业局从1950年成立以来，年年都把大批木材丢弃在山场里，任凭风吹雨打，逐日烂坏。据统计，到1955年8月份止，丢弃的木材共有十三万多立方公尺。这些被丢弃的木材大部分已经经过采伐、选材、小集中、吊卯四道工序，仅这四道工序的工资，就支出了八十七万多元。这些长期被丢弃在山场上的木材，虽然有些已经腐朽变质，但大部分仍可使用。例如向阳伐木场被丢弃的四十多立方公尺木材中，能使用的有51％以上，其中还有15.2％是等内材。老育林伐木场三个材班丢弃的二十多立方公尺木材中，有使用价值的也占62％。
    但是，问题严重的是，乌敏河森林工业局不是如何设法把这些被丢弃的木材搬运下来，而是总在考虑如何制造“理由”，就地“报销”。今年第二季度乌敏河森林工业局木材科科长高凯、财务科科长杨静带领六十多名干部到贮木场清点木材，就是为了“查明数字，以便报销”。伊春森林工业管理局没有认真查对乌敏河森林工业局所提报销“理由”，就把公文照样转给了林业部（当时森林工业部尚未建立）。林业部有关单位虽曾几次要求乌敏河森林工业局详细报告丢弃的原因，但并没有追查到底，结果仍是稀里糊涂地照数批准报销了。
    最近。在林业国家监察局的督促下，乌敏河森林工业局才制订杜绝丢弃木材的具体措施，并要求各伐木场对几年来丢弃在山场里的木材作出清理计划。但根据已往的情况来看，光订计划仍然是不行的。为了使这批木材少受损失，我们要求乌敏河森林工业局用最快的速度把它拉下山来。　书林
