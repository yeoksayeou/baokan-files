Xinhua News Agency, August 26th -- According to a United Press report from London: Britain and France continue to intensify their military buildup threatening Egypt.

    Five cargo ships requisitioned by the British government are loading military supplies in preparation for sailing to the Mediterranean. Trains loaded with soldiers and military supplies are also arriving one after another from across the British Isles into British ports. It is said that this is the largest concentration of British troops since the days of the Second World War when the continent of Europe was invaded. According to an official spokesman, a battalion currently stationed in Singapore will also be recalled to Britain soon.

    France has already equipped some army and naval units in preparation for stationing them in the Mediterranean.

    英法加紧调兵威胁埃及
    新华社26日讯　据合众社伦敦消息：英法两国继续加紧进行威胁埃及的军事集结工作。
    英国政府征用的五只货船正在装载军事供应品准备开往地中海。满载士兵和军用品的火车也一列一列地从英国各岛开进英国港口。据说这是自从第二次世界大战开始进攻欧洲大陆的日子以来最大一次的英国军队的集结。据一个官方发言人说，现驻新加坡的一个营也很快要调回英国。
    法国已经装备了一些陆军和海军部队准备派到地中海去驻防。
