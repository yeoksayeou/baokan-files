    Dedicated to Manjushri
    Nepalese Poet Tularam
    Translator's note: The author is a member of the Nepalese cultural delegation currently visiting China, and a famous poet in Nepal. This poem was written for the visit to China. In his own words: "This is a dedication to the great soul of China - Manjushri." According to ancient Nepalese legends, before recorded history, the Kathmandu Valley region of Nepal was originally a lake. Manjushri came here from China and painstakingly drained the lake, allowing the people who came with him to settle down and establish the nation of Nepal. Therefore, even today, Manjushri is greatly respected in Nepal. Manjushri, I pray for you to come here to me, to visit once again, to see what you can do for me, you. Only you know what has happened and what is happening, only you can, oh, indicate what should be done. For the sake of the radiant five-colored lotus flower, [1] you left the palace on Mount Wutai, you, master of science and art, holding a scroll in one hand and raising a treasure sword in the other, [2] split the mountains, drained the lake, and the name of Nepal appeared. Master who understands the source of the universe! You also taught us the essentials of life. Later, a great son was born to me, his name was Sakyamuni, [3] with great compassion and great courage, he advocated egalitarianism to the whole world. My teacher Manjushri, from the land you established and taught, your motherland received a gift, that is, the teachings of Sakyamuni. I followed your teachings and created many beautiful models, buildings, sculptures and streamers, dances, music and songs, my teacher, so my children shine like stars in the sky in the fields of human achievement, and the fame of artistic creators spreads all over the world. People from afar come over mountains and seas to appreciate the nobility of my children's works, but envy and praise have not made them so drunk that they cannot see your grace, nor have they made them forget to send Araniko to your country to contribute his wisdom. [4] Here, many Brahman palaces and Buddhist temples are left behind by Araniko and his cultural envoys, even today. In the White Pagoda, you can see the Dharani written in the Lanyaga script, [5] in the five major temples on Mount Wutai, you can see our shared thoughts and sweat, close friendly relations, and the exchange of lofty feelings. My name is still Nepal, a beautiful country among the mountains, under the leadership of the beloved former King Tribhuvan, I have abolished the dictatorial government. I have not forgotten the science and art that you taught, whose glory once shone for thousands of years, but what worries me now is how to guarantee their rebirth and progress. Having defeated colonialism and feudalism, your great country has been liberated, the People's Republic radiates immense light, and hundreds of millions of people are united in the ocean of freedom, equality, and fraternity. Ah, in your transformed country, there must be many things worth studying carefully and examining closely. Therefore, today I come to your hometown, Manjushri, you know my sincerity, I put my palms together to you.

    [Note attached] [1] Mythology says that Manjushri Bodhisattva heard that a strange lotus flower was blooming in the lake there in Nepal, so he went from Mount Wutai. This lotus flower is the "self-illuminating one," the origin of the universe.
    [2] Mythology narrates that Manjushri holds a sword in one hand (symbolizing science) and a book in the other (symbolizing art). He used his sword to split the mountain and drain the lake.
    [3] Lumbini, the birthplace of Sakyamuni, belongs to the territory of Nepal. "Born to me" means "born to Nepal".
    [4] Araniko was a famous Nepalese architect in the 14th century who worked in the Yuan Dynasty court in China. The White Pagoda in Beijing was designed and expanded by him.
    [5] Dharani is a kind of character used in Esoteric Buddhism, which is a character composed of several letters. (with picture)

    献给文殊师利
    尼泊尔诗人  屠拉达尔
    译者按：作者是现在访问我国的尼泊尔访华文化代表团团员，尼泊尔的著名诗人。这首诗是为访问中国而作的，用他自己的话说：“这是给中国伟大的灵魂——文殊师利的献辞。”据尼泊尔古代传说，在有史之前，尼泊尔溪谷地区，原来是湖泊。文殊师利由中国来到此地，他辛苦地将湖水排去，让同来的人们安居下来，建立了尼泊尔国。因此，直到如今，文殊师利在尼泊尔受到极大的尊敬。文殊师利啊，我祈求您到我这里来啊，再一次来访问，看一看能够为我做些什么啊，您。只有您才知道什么事情已经发生和正在发生着什么事情，只有您才能够啊，指示什么事情应当进行。为了放光的五色莲花，〔一〕当时离开了五台山的宫殿，您啊，科学和艺术的大师，您一手拿着书卷，一手提起宝
  剑，〔二〕将山岭劈开，将湖水排干，尼泊尔的名字这才出现。通达宇宙之源的大师啊！您还教会了我们人生的要件。后来，一个伟大的儿子降生给我，他的名字是释迦牟尼，〔三〕大慈大悲而又大勇大力地，他向全世界倡导着大同主义。吾师文殊师利啊，从您所建立的和教导的国土里，您的祖国接受了一份赠礼，那就是释迦牟尼的教义。我遵行了您的教训，创造了许多美丽的典范，建筑，雕刻和幢幡，舞蹈，音乐和歌赞，吾师啊，因此我的儿女们在人类各种成就的领域中，像星星在天空一样光明灿烂，美艺创造者的声名在世界上遍传。远方的人们翻山过海而来，来欣赏我的儿女们作品的高贵，可是艳羡和赞美，并没有使他们沉醉，以至看不见您的恩惠，也没有使他们忘记，派遣阿尼哥到您的国土来，贡献出他的智慧。〔四〕这里，不少的梵宫和佛殿，是阿尼哥和他的文化使节遗留下来的，直到今天。在白塔里，能看到用朗伽罗文写的
    总持字，〔五〕在五台山上的五大寺中，能看到我们共有的心思和血汗，亲密的友爱的关联，交流的崇高的情感。我的名字仍旧是尼泊尔，万山之中美丽的国土，在众所爱戴的前王底里普班的领导
    下，我已经废除了独裁政府。我也没有遗忘您所教导的科学和艺
    术，它们的光辉曾经照耀千古，然而现在使我操心的，却是如何保证它们的新生和进步。战胜了殖民主义和封建主义，您的伟大国家已经获得了解放，人民共和国放射着光芒万丈，亿万人团结在自由、平等、友爱的
    海洋。啊，在您的改变了面貌的国土上，一定有许多值得认真研究，仔细端
    详。因此，今天我来到您的家乡，文殊
    师利啊，您知道我的至诚，我向您合掌。
          （赵朴初译）
          （赵朴初译）
    〔注附〕〔一〕神话中说，文殊师利菩萨因为听到尼泊尔那里的湖中开着一朵奇异的莲花，便由五台山前往。这个莲花乃是“自体放光者”，宇宙生起之本源。
    〔二〕神话叙述文殊师利一手持剑（象征科学），一手持书（象征艺术），他用剑劈开了山，将湖水排去。
    〔三〕释迦牟尼诞生地蓝毗尼，属尼泊尔国境。“降生给我”即“降生给尼泊尔”。
    〔四〕阿尼哥是公元十四世纪尼泊尔名建筑师，在中国元代宫廷供职，北京的白塔就是他设计扩建的。
    〔五〕总持字是佛教密宗用的一种用几个字母拼合起来的字。（附图片）
