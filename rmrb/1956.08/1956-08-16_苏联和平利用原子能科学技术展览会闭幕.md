    Soviet Exhibition on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Closes
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th - The Soviet Exhibition on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Science and Technology, which has been on display in Beijing for two months, closed today.

    During the exhibition, various technical exchange activities were carried out. For over a month, starting from July 6th, a total of 9,000 Chinese experts, professors, engineers, physicians, and responsible persons from relevant departments made professional visits. Soviet experts held fourteen lectures and twelve discussion sessions and Q&A sessions for Chinese scientists.
    The exhibition and technical exchange activities have had a great impact on the Chinese scientific community. More than seventy engineers from Anshan Iron and Steel Company are very interested in the application of radioactive isotopes in the metallurgical industry. The company has now decided to establish a radioactive isotope laboratory in its original central laboratory, and has specially invited Soviet expert Kurikov to Anshan to help. Scientists from some universities and industrial departments have also asked Soviet experts how to establish radioactive isotope laboratories in their respective units.

    苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会闭幕
    据新华社15日讯　在北京展出两个月的苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会今天闭幕。
    这个展览会在展出期间曾进行了各种技术交流活动。从七月六日起的一个多月中，有中国的专家、教授、工程师、医师和各有关部门负责人共九千人进行了专业参观。苏联专家为中国的科学工作者举行了十四次报告会和十二次座谈会、问题解答会。
  　展览会的展出和技术交流活动，在中国科学界起了很大的影响。鞍山钢铁公司七十多个工程师对放射性同位素在冶金工业方面的运用很感兴趣，现在这个公司已经决定在原来的中心试验室内设立放射性同位素试验室，并且特地邀请苏联专家库里科夫到鞍山去帮助。一些高等学校和产业部门的科学工作者，也纷纷请教苏联专家如何在本单位成立放射性同位素试验室。
