    Write More Communications Reflecting Rural Life

    Since the People's Daily was revised, we all have a refreshing feeling. The newspaper's coverage of rural areas is also more vivid. However, is it possible to increase the number of fresh and interesting communications reporting on rural life in various places? I am from Sichuan, and now I work in Fujian. Almost as soon as I close my eyes, I think of the scenery of peas and broad bean flowers blooming in Sichuan in the spring. I have been away from my hometown for many years. What changes have taken place in the land and people there? The rapeseed flowers of the cooperative must be blooming even more luxuriantly! Speaking of Sichuan's land, it is really good. The rapeseed flowers are really tall and plentiful, stretching as far as the eye can see. How much I would like to see communications in the People's Daily that report on rural life in Sichuan with the flavor of the soil! Unfortunately, there are too few of these kinds of communications.

    多写些反映农村生活的通讯
    人民日报改版以后，我们都有耳目一新的感觉。报纸对农村的报道，也更加生动了。但是，是不是可以增加一些报道各地农村生活的新鲜、有趣的通讯呢？我是四川人，现在在福建工作，差不多一闭上眼睛，就想到四川春天的豌豆、葫豆花开的景色。我离开家乡多年了，那里的土地和人起了什么变化呢？合作社的菜花该是开得更加繁盛了吧！想起来四川的土地就是好，菜花真是又高又多，望不到头。我是多么想在人民日报上看到报道四川农村生活的有泥土味的通讯啊！可惜，这种通讯太少太少了。
