Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 27th: According to TASS, Hungarian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Hegedüs, said that the Yugoslav government has accepted the Hungarian government's proposal to upgrade the legations to embassies and exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level.

Hegedüs said: Due to the joint efforts of the Hungarian and Yugoslav governments, great progress has been made in the friendly relations between the two countries. Hungary and Yugoslavia have signed financial agreements, scientific and technological agreements, and air traffic agreements. The ties between cultural groups and mass social organizations of the two countries have been expanding daily.

Hegedüs made the above remarks on August 26th when he attended a mass rally held by the Hungarian Patriotic People's Front in Nagykanizsa, Zala County, addressing thousands of participants.

Hegedüs expressed regret for what had happened between Hungary and Yugoslavia in the past. He said that we have corrected and abandoned the mistakes of the past, and we must do our best to establish close cooperation and good relations on a principled basis between Hungary and Yugoslavia, two countries that are carrying out socialist construction.

Hegedüs continued, saying that strengthening the ties between our two countries would allow us to remove the restrictions set up along the Yugoslav border after 1949, and to remove border zone and technical obstacles.

The Hungarian government has decided that those who were moved from the border area after 1949 in accordance with administrative measures can return to their original locations without restriction.

    匈牙利部长会议主席赫格居斯说
    匈南将互派大使促进友好关系
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯27日讯：匈牙利部长会议主席赫格居斯说，南斯拉夫政府已经接受了匈牙利政府提出的关于将公使馆升格互派大使级外交代表的建议。
    赫格居斯说：由于匈、南两国政府共同努力，两国友好关系已经有了很大的进展。匈牙利同南斯拉夫签订了财政协定、科学技术和航空交通协定。两国的文化团体、群众社会团体等的联系已经日益扩大。
    赫格居斯在8月26日出席了匈牙利爱国人民阵线在萨拉州那吉卡尼萨召开的群众大会，他向数千名与会者说了上面这番话。
    赫格居斯对过去匈、南两国之间发生的事情表示遗憾。他说，我们纠正和摈弃了过去的错误，我们要尽力使匈牙利和南斯拉夫这两个正在进行社会主义建设的国家，在原则性的基础上建立密切的合作和良好的关系。
    赫格居斯接着说，加强了我们两国的联系，就可以取消1949年以后在靠南斯拉夫边境设置的那些限制，取消边境地带和技术障碍物。
    匈牙利政府已经作出决定，那些在1949年以后遵照行政措施从边境地区迁走的人可以毫无限制地回到原处来。
