    What Does the Outcome of the London Conference Show?
    By Pan Fei, Our Correspondent in London
    The London Conference, lasting a week, concluded on the afternoon of the 23rd. As a result of this conference, two proposals for resolving the Suez Canal issue emerged. One was the American plan, presented by Dulles on behalf of Western countries, and the other was the Indian plan, supported by the Soviet Union and major Asian countries. The colonial nature of the American plan is obvious: it remains unchanged in its essence, insisting on international control of the Suez Canal. The Indian plan strictly respects Egypt's sovereignty and points out a way to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal dispute. The nature of these two proposals is so different that no one would imagine reconciling them, nor would anyone imagine that the Indian plan could be erased from the conference table by means of "voting."
    Now, the bourgeois newspapers are unanimously and desperately promoting that seventeen or eighteen countries "support" the American plan. But everyone knows that this hypocritical "majority" is worthless. Its legal effect is zero. Because the London Conference, due to its unreasonable and unjust composition, has no binding force on the decisions it makes. This "majority" also represents the moral failure of the Western countries. The members participating in the London Conference were carefully selected by the Western countries, but even so, a "unanimous" decision could not be made. In this regard, the "Yorkshire Post" made a remark that should also be mentioned: at the London Conference, there was a "split between Asian countries and Western countries. This is very regrettable." The real majority does not belong to London but to Cairo. Inside and outside the conference, the countries expressing support for Egypt's just actions have a total population of 1.5 billion, accounting for three-fifths of the world's population. There is no more authoritative and persuasive figure than this!
    Such an ending of the London Conference is contrary to the wishes of certain groups. In London and Paris, some people wanted to beat the drums of war in the conference hall and engage in military intimidation. However, as soon as the conference began, the clamor of power politics was forced to retreat. The speeches at the conference, with a few exceptions, all acknowledged, or verbally acknowledged, that Egypt's sovereignty must be respected and that the Suez Canal dispute should be resolved through peaceful consultation.
    Public opinion is particularly interested in the British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's statement mentioning that Britain hopes to resolve the Suez Canal dispute peacefully. Anyone with a clear head can see that war is not a word that can be casually played with; it is an extremely serious reality. The "Daily Mirror" once published a full-page map of the Middle East situation titled "Suez from London." This map raised the question: if war breaks out, Britain will need bases. But where are Britain's bases? It answered: "There is Cyprus, where 'thugs' have killed thousands of British soldiers; there is Malta, which is far from the Suez Canal; in Jordan... this is where Glubb was driven out. Look at the coast of Africa! Algeria is part of France, but 400,000 French troops are trapped in a bloody war against Arab nationalism."
    The aforementioned kind of people used the London Conference to launch slanderous attacks against Egypt. But a more important fact should be seen: colonialism was most severely condemned at this conference. On August 21st, Shepilov delivered a two-hour speech, exposing the so-called international co-management colonialist plan to broad daylight and making a thorough and complete criticism of it.
    In short, running through the London Conference was the struggle between the two lines of military threat and peaceful consultation, and the confrontation between the two forces of colonialism and anti-colonialism.
    The London Conference has ended, but the struggle surrounding the Suez Canal issue continues to unfold. Western countries are attempting to impose their "majority" plan on Egypt, creating a tense situation. In addition, there are reports that Western countries are still planning to use the withdrawal of pilots as a means to artificially create chaos, and the bad ideas of so-called economic sanctions and military threats against Egypt are also being actively brewed.
    Egypt, you need to be vigilant!

### 伦敦会议的结果说明了什么

    伦敦会议的结果说明了什么
    本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    伦敦会议历时一周，已在二十三日下午闭幕。作为这一会议的结果，是出现了解决苏彝士运河问题的两个方案。一个是由杜勒斯代表西方国家提出的美国方案，另一个是得到苏联和亚洲主要国家支持的印度方案。美国方案的殖民主义性质是一目了然的：它万变不离其宗，坚持对苏彝士运河实行国际管制。印度的方案则严格地尊重埃及的主权，并且指出了和平解决苏彝士运河纠纷的途径。这两个方案的性质是如此截然不同，因此没有人会设想把它们加以调和起来，也没有人会设想可以用“表决”的方法，把印度方案从会议桌上抹掉。
    现在，资产阶级的报纸全体一致地拚命宣传：十七国或十八国“支持”美国方案。但是谁都知道，这个虚伪的“多数”是没有什么价值的。它在法律效力上等于零。因为伦敦会议由于它的组成的不合理、不公正，这个会议作出的决定是没有约束力的。这种“多数”也表示西方国家在道义上的失败。参加伦敦会议的成员，都是由西方国家精挑细剔出来的，但是即使如此，也不能作出一个“一致”的决定。关于这，还应该提到“约克郡邮报”的一句话，它说：在伦敦会议上出现了“亚洲国家和西方国家的分裂。这是十分遗憾的”。真正的多数不属于伦敦而属于开罗。在会内会外，对埃及的正义行动表示支持的国家，人口总数共达十五亿，占全世界人口的五分之三。没有比这个更有权威、更具有说服力的数字了！
    伦敦会议的这样一个结局，是违反某些集团的愿望的。在伦敦和巴黎，都有人想在会议厅中擂起战鼓，进行军事恫吓。然而，会议一开始，实力政策的叫嚣就被迫退到一边去了。大会的发言，除了个别的以外，都承认或者在口头上承认：埃及的主权必须予以尊重，苏彝士运河问题的纠纷应该以和平协商的方法来解决。
    舆论界对于英国外交大臣劳埃德发言中提到英国希望和平解决苏彝士运河问题的纠纷，特别感到兴趣。头脑清醒一点的人，不难看出：战争，并不是一个可以随意玩弄的字样，它是极为严重的现实问题。“每日镜报”曾经以整版的篇幅，刊载了题为“从伦敦看苏彝士”的中东形势图。这幅地图提出了这样一个问题：假如战争发生，英国就需要基地。但是英国的基地在哪里呢？它回答道：“有塞浦路斯，在那里‘暴徒’已经杀死了成千的英国士兵；有马尔他，它离苏彝士运河很远；在约旦……这就是格拉布被赶出去的地方。你看看非洲的海岸吧！阿尔及利亚是法国的一部分，但是有四十万法国军队陷于反对阿拉伯民族主义的血腥战争中。”
    上述的这一种人，利用伦敦会议对埃及进行诬蔑性的攻击。但应该看到一个更重要的事实：殖民主义在这个会议上受到了最严正的谴责。八月二十一日谢皮洛夫作了长达两小时的发言，把所谓国际共管的殖民主义方案，放在光天化日之下，作了体无完肤的抨击。
    总之，贯穿于伦敦会议的，是武力威胁和和平协商两条路线的斗争，是殖民主义和反殖民主义两种力量的抗衡。
    伦敦会议是结束了，但是围绕着苏彝士运河问题的斗争还在继续展开。西方国家正企图径自把它们的“多数”方案，强加于埃及，制造紧张局势。另外，有消息说，西方国家还在打算以撤回领航员作为手段，人为地制造混乱，而对埃及进行所谓经济制裁和军事威胁的坏主意，也在加紧酝酿之中。
    埃及呵，你需要警惕！
