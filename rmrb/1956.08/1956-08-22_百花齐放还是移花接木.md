Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom or Grafting?
	Zhi Xiu

	The recent debate in the People's Daily regarding national style and national form in music and dance is a debate about policy and principles. The starting point of the debate appears to be the view of "neither Chinese nor Western," "a mixture of Chinese and Western," but the essence of the problem lies in how to correctly treat the national artistic tradition and heritage, and how to correctly learn from foreign art. Whether this problem is properly resolved will affect the development of Chinese art for a considerable period to come.

	(I) "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" or "Grafting"?

	The Party's policy in art is "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New." "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" means mobilizing all forces, encouraging various different art forms and schools to compete with each other, and develop together, so as to make our country's art flourish, in order to better serve the people and serve socialism. To this end, we must inherit and carry forward our excellent artistic traditions and heritage, and critically absorb everything useful from foreign countries.

	Since liberation, many new literary and art workers have cooperated with the broad masses of folk artists in opera, music, dance, and other aspects, and have made great achievements in sorting out, excavating, and reforming national heritage and folk art. The adaptation and performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is one of the best examples. At the same time, there have also been many gains in learning foreign art. This is the main aspect and must be affirmed. However, whether it is inheriting and carrying forward the national artistic tradition, or learning foreign art, our work is still far from enough, and we should continue to make serious efforts.

	The question is, what is the main dangerous tendency in current art work? It should be admitted that the main dangerous tendency at present is to despise, exclude, and negate the national tradition and national heritage. Some comrades in charge of art leadership work do not recognize the positive significance and role of the splendid and rich cultural and artistic heritage created and accumulated by the Chinese people over thousands of years. They one-sidedly exaggerate its backwardness, believing that Chinese traditional art is backward, unscientific, and lacks the ability to express life. Therefore, not only do they not give it protection and support, but they discriminate against and exclude it. They do not study and master the history, laws, and characteristics of Chinese art, and do not understand its comprehensiveness, integrity, and unity. They mechanically transplant foreign experience and "transform" it in a crude and rigid manner, causing it to lose its original style. They do not understand the deep connection between Chinese traditional art and the broad masses of the people, which is pleasing and pleasing to the people, and always feel that it does not suit their taste, and attempt to replace it with Western art. This kind of dogmatic thinking and practice has put Chinese national and folk art in a suppressed position in some aspects.

	Some comrades have proposed creating new national forms of music and dance, which is welcome. However, what they advocate for creating national forms of music and dance is not to create Chinese art with its own unique style by inheriting and carrying forward the national traditional art, and critically absorbing useful things from foreign countries as nourishment, but to advocate "accelerating integration," "neither Chinese nor Western," and "grafting." If we develop along this path, no matter what their subjective wishes are, the objective result will inevitably cause serious blows and destruction to Chinese national and folk art, and even lead to its extinction. This runs counter to the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom."

	First of all, we must talk about the "neither Chinese nor Western," "mixture of Chinese and Western" issue that has caused the debate. Chinese art does not exist in isolation, it will inevitably be affected by many foreign arts. We must both innovate national and folk art, and consciously absorb certain excellent and useful elements of foreign art in Chinese music and dance, as long as this absorption does not destroy the original national style, this is completely appropriate. If someone creates new works of art, attempting to combine Chinese and Western elements, but because their skills are not up to par, the things produced are "neither Chinese nor Western" and "a mixture of Chinese and Western," although they are not welcomed by the majority of audiences or listeners, there is nothing wrong with that. The artist should be allowed to try again and again, and maybe one day he will master it and create a complete work of art with a unique style.

	However, the appearance of many "neither Chinese nor Western" phenomena now is not entirely due to this reason. On the contrary, it is often the case that the fairly perfect Chinese traditional works of art that were originally loved by the broad masses of the people are artificially dismembered, and many Western things are forcibly added, making them become neither fish nor fowl. For example, for Chu Opera, regardless of its laws and characteristics, obliterating its traditional programs, negating its original singing tunes and performance methods, abolishing percussion instruments, and creating a new set of music, forcing it to be changed to "new opera." For some folk songs, instead of seeking its original tune and carefully sorting and processing it, it is mechanically applying the melody of Western music to "adapt" it. For some traditional Chinese song and dance programs, many beautiful movements are cut off, and Western ballet is added, and only dancing is allowed without singing, so that it is completely unrecognizable. For example, some works greatly praised by Comrade Cheng Yun and others are typical examples of making Chinese traditional works of art "neither Chinese nor Western." Adopting this dogmatic method to "change China with the West" will not create new forms of national music and dance, and the result will be "replacing China with the West" and eliminating Chinese traditional art. To vigorously advocate such a "neither Chinese nor Western" as if it is the direction of the development of Chinese art is something we cannot agree with.

	Comrade Li Ling especially advocates "grafting." He believes that music language is rarely restricted by region, and transplantation has been carried out in history, and it doesn't matter who transplanted whose. He emphasized the worldliness of art and negated the nationality of art. According to this proposition to carry out "grafting," naturally it is not to develop the national style and national characteristics of art, but to make them more uniform according to the standards of Western art, that is, to become the common language of mankind as Comrade Li Ling said. As everyone knows, "grafting" always requires cutting off something and attaching something. Here, the wood of course refers to Chinese wood, and the flower of course refers to Western flowers. Therefore, its actual meaning is: cut the wood of Chinese traditional art, connect the branches of Western art, and bloom a "common" flower that is neither fish nor fowl. This is also an effective method of injuring Chinese national traditional art. In fact, some people are already consciously or unconsciously doing it in this way. It can be imagined that the result of doing so will not be "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" but "One Flower Alone Blooms" in China and in the world family in the future.

	It is necessary to create new national music forms. But it should be created on the basis of Chinese national and folk music. Leaving the Chinese soil, obliterating the Chinese music tradition, mechanically transplanting Western music will produce foreign things, not new Chinese national music. We are not national conservatives and do not think that Chinese existing art cannot be changed; we advocate gradually innovating and developing Chinese art. In the process of innovating and developing Chinese art, we must use foreign excellent art as a reference and nourishment. But the most urgent thing at present is to support Chinese national folk art, carefully cultivate it, and consolidate its foundation and make its branches and leaves lush. At the same time, it can also better absorb the nourishment of foreign art, and gradually develop and improve itself. The absorption of foreign culture and art must adopt a critical scientific attitude, and should be digested, and never swallowed raw. Therefore, we must not be too hasty. Otherwise, it will not only not improve health, but will also ruin Chinese traditional art. Accelerating integration is not feasible in fact; if it is not done well, it will cause indigestion and become morbid.

	(II) Do not Despise and Negate National Heritage

	Comrades who despise, exclude, and negate the national tradition and national heritage have a set of ways of looking at problems. They used a simple formula: the economic base determines the superstructure, what kind of society has what kind of art, and the superstructure must change with the change of the economic base. Starting from this law, they believe that Western art is progressive and scientific, and Chinese traditional art is feudal and backward. Therefore, we must use Western art to transform Chinese traditional art, and everything that does not conform to the laws and formats of Western art should be eliminated. Opera should be eliminated or changed to new opera; percussion instruments are noisy instruments and should be abolished from now on; folk singing violates physiological hygiene principles and should be replaced by Western singing; singing and dancing are not in line with the regulations of all-round development and professional division of labor, and should be separated... A series of crude practices followed one after another.

	It is true that the economic base determines the superstructure. But as early as the 1890s, Engels pointed out in his letters: once the superstructure is formed, it has its relative independence and can have a counter-effect on the economic base. Moreover, the various elements of the superstructure, including culture and art, have a certain degree of inheritance in its development process. He said: "The historical ideologist (the word history here is only a collective term for politics, law, philosophy, theology, etc. - in short, all areas not only related to nature but also related to society) in each scientific field has certain materials, these materials are formed independently from the thinking of previous generations, and have undergone their own independent development path in the minds of these generations." Engels did not object to the inheritance of certain things. On the contrary, he advocated using and reforming them.

	Foreign art, because it has passed through capitalist society, and in the Soviet Union it has passed through socialist society, many experiences have been sorted out, systematized, and scientized, and it is enough for China to learn from. Therefore, we advocate learning foreign excellent art, especially from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

	But Chinese national and folk art are not all feudal and backward. In class society, there are two different opposing cultures. The literature and art of Chinese feudal society have feudal dross, but also democratic and popular essence. After the transition to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, especially since the May Fourth Movement, there have been imperialist and feudal literature and art, as well as democratic and socialist literature and art. The latter often expresses the people's longing for a better life and fantasy, expresses dissatisfaction and resistance to the ugly reality of the old society, and expresses the unyielding spirit of struggle for national independence and people's liberation. This is the precious wealth of Chinese art. In addition, Chinese traditional art, through the creative efforts of generations of working people, especially artists, has accumulated rich and exquisite techniques, and some techniques are admired by later artists as unique skills. This part has no class nature and should be accepted and improved as much as possible. Chinese art is backward in some aspects compared with the West, but it is not all backward. Therefore, it is incorrect to obliterate the national heritage.

	Chinese socialist literature and art will not fall from the sky. Chinese literary and art workers must master the national artistic heritage, accept all valuable things in it, and improve and develop it under new conditions, in order to create Chinese art with a unique style. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "China's current new politics and new economy have developed from the old politics and old economy in ancient times, and China's current new culture has also developed from the old culture in ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our history and must not cut off history." Today, when the people have grasped the power, our literary and art workers should respect history more and pay attention to inheriting and carrying forward the national tradition and national heritage.

	There is such a saying that China has almost no national tradition of music and dance, and most of the excellent arts in history and the present are imported from the outside, which further negates the national tradition and national heritage. Obviously, this is a non-Marxist viewpoint and a serious distortion of history. Music and dance were created by the people from labor. China had its own music and dance in ancient times. Of course, this traditional art is constantly developing, and in the process of development, it has absorbed some foreign things. The Han and Tang dynasties absorbed a relatively large amount of foreign art, but the practice at that time had certain historical conditions, and it was still based on Chinese traditional art to absorb it, so it cannot belittle the status of Chinese traditional art.

	(III) Thoughts and Feelings Must Be One with the People

	Every nation's art has its own national style and national form. This national style and form are formed in a long historical process. It is suitable for the living habits and national character of the working people of this nation, and has a flesh-and-blood connection with the broad masses of the people, and is familiar and welcomed by the people. This can be often proved in the practice of art performances. The reactions and effects caused by native things and foreign things in the masses of the people are different. Many excellent traditional opera programs, the masses never tire of watching them, because the thoughts and feelings expressed in them are closely connected with the masses of the people, and the masses understand it and love it. We advocate inheriting and carrying forward the national art tradition, excavating and sorting out folk art, also in order to better contact the masses, educate the masses, so that the masses can be entertained, in order to better serve socialism.

	Comrade Li Ling put forward the theory of "a hundred products for a hundred customers." Comrade Cheng Yun made further elaboration, saying: "If our people are not very generally accustomed to listening to 'symphony' today, they will definitely get used to it in the future." "A hundred products for a hundred customers" is true, so we do not exclude Western art. But people can't help but ask: what kind of goods are you selling, and what kind of customers are you catering to? It cannot be said that there is no difference at all here. "Symphony" has been loved by some people today, and it may be generally accustomed to by the people in the future, and should continue to be played. But the future is still tomorrow, so what do you take to pay the bill to the 600 million compatriots today? It can be seen that Comrade Li Ling and Comrade Cheng Yun have not yet settled down, their thoughts and feelings have not yet become one with the masses of the people, "their souls are still a small bourgeois intellectual kingdom," they attempt to replace the needs of the majority of the masses with the preferences of a few people, they have too little consideration for making themselves mass-oriented, in order to better approach the masses, but require the masses to accommodate them more. All of these have already been criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.

	The nationalization and massization of art are closely combined. Truly loving the people and enthusiastically serving the people must love the folk art of their own nation. Despising the national folk art and blindly worshiping the West, no matter how nice the words are, will inevitably be divorced from the masses of the people. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is a matter of position. Any artist, if he wants to truly become an artist of the people and make a greater contribution to the people, should truly become one with the masses of the people in his thoughts and feelings.

	(IV) How to Participate in the International Family

	Comrade Li Ling's article emphasized the commonality and connection of music language. Comrade Cheng Yun more clearly said: foreign forms of music creation "are shared by the international family, and have been jointly enriched by musicians of various nationalities in the history of world music. To be more precise, whoever can master it, use it to express the voice of their own nation, and be understood and welcomed by the people of their own nation, it belongs to whoever it is."

	No one opposes advocating mastering and using foreign music forms. However, the articles of Li and Cheng greatly exaggerated the internationality of music and ignored the nationality of music; emphasized commonality and negated individuality; called for mastering foreign music forms without advocating carrying forward the musical traditions of the motherland, which gave people the feeling of worshiping the West and suppressing China, and it was also unreasonable in terms of reason.

	According to common sense, the international family is composed of various ethnic groups. Without the various ethnic groups, there would be no world. Music and dance, under certain circumstances, have internationality, but at the same time, they also have a strong nationality, that is, national color and national style. The music and dance of one nation will not be completely the same as those of another nation. Beethoven and Chopin are recognized music masters by all countries in the world, but they are indeed excellent German and Polish musicians, respectively. They grew up on the soil of their motherland, sucking the milk of the people. It is precisely because the international music family is composed of the musical sounds of various ethnic groups that it can be so colorful and varied today.

	China is an independent and autonomous country with a long cultural history of thousands of years and traditional national music and dance. China must not adopt a passive "borrowing" attitude towards the international family, and be satisfied with sitting back and enjoying the existing art forms of the international family. While absorbing foreign art, China should greatly promote the art heritage of the motherland, create music and dance with a unique national style, and contribute to the international family. This is the correct attitude to actively participate in the international family. History proves that the art that is most rich in national color and national style is the most international. One of the important reasons why many Chinese art delegations are welcomed in foreign performances is also here. A nation that does not have its own national style of art cannot stand in the international art family.

	Comrade Cheng Yun used Xian Xinghai and Mozart as examples to illustrate that great musicians first learned foreign things before they could write works that truly have national characteristics. This is also a dogmatic statement. We do not deny that some musicians have absorbed useful nourishment in foreign music; it is beneficial for musicians to learn foreign things. But it cannot be said that only after learning foreign things well can one write works with national characteristics. If so, there would be no Chinese musicians in ancient times before foreign music was introduced; it would be impossible for outstanding musical talents to emerge from the Chinese folk today. This saying that Western comes before Chinese, and Chinese can only exist with the existence of Western, reveals how serious Comrade Cheng Yun's thoughts of worshiping the West and despising the motherland have developed. Today, while preventing national conservatism, we must focus on opposing this kind of national nihilistic thought.

    百花齐放还是移花接木
    志修
    最近人民日报关于音乐舞蹈的民族风格和民族形式的论争，是一个方针性原则性的论争。争论的起点表面上是对“不中不西”、“中西混杂”的看法，而问题的实质在于如何正确地对待民族的艺术传统和遗产，以及如何正确地学习外国艺术。这个问题解决得是否妥当，将会影响到今后相当长时期内中国艺术的发展。
    （一）“百花齐放”还是“移花接木”
    党在艺术方面的政策，是“百花齐放，推陈出新”。“百花齐放”，就是要调动一切力量，鼓励各种不同的艺术形式和流派互相竞赛，共同发展，使我国的艺术事业繁荣起来，以便更好地为人民服务，为社会主义服务。为此，必须继承和发扬我国优秀的艺术传统和遗产，并且批判地吸取外国一切有用的东西。
    解放以来，许多新文艺工作者和广大的民间艺术家合作，在戏曲、音乐、舞蹈等方面，在整理、发掘和改革民族遗产和民间艺术上，都取得了很大成绩。“十五贯”的改编和演出，就是最好的范例之一。同时，在学习外国艺术上，也有不少的收获。这是主要的方面，是必须加以肯定的。但是，无论是继承和发扬民族艺术传统，或者是学习外国艺术，我们的工作还做得很不够，应该继续进行认真的努力。
    问题在于当前艺术工作的主要危险倾向是什么？应该承认：当前的主要危险倾向是轻视、排斥和否定民族传统和民族遗产。一部分负责艺术的领导工作同志，不认识我国人民几千年来所创造和积累的灿烂丰富的文化艺术遗产的积极意义和作用，片面地夸大它的落后性，认为中国传统的艺术是落后的、不科学的，缺乏表现生活的能力，因而不但不给以保护和扶植，反而加以歧视和排斥。他们不去研究和掌握中国艺术的历史，它的规律和特点，不了解它的综合性、完整性、统一性，机械地搬用外国的经验，用粗暴的生硬的办法加以“改造”，使它丧失原来的风格。他们不了解中国的传统的艺术同广大人民群众的深厚联系，为人民所喜见乐闻，总感到不合自己的脾胃，企图以西洋艺术取而代之。这种教条主义的想法和作法，使得中国的民族的和民间的艺术，在某些方面处于被压抑的地位。
    有些同志提出要创造音乐舞蹈的新的民族形式，这是值得欢迎的事。但是，他们所主张的创造音乐舞蹈的民族形式，并不是在继承和发扬民族的传统艺术的基础上，批判地吸收外国的有用的东西作为养料，来创造中国自己的具有独特风格的艺术，而是提倡“加紧融化”、“不中不西”、“移花接木”。如果循着这个途径发展，不管他们的主观愿望如何，客观的结果必然会使中国的民族的和民间的艺术受到严重的打击和摧残，乃至归于消灭。这是同党的“百花齐放”的政策背道而驰的。
    首先不能不谈到引起争论的“不中不西”、“中西混杂”问题。中国艺术不是孤立地存在的，它必然要受到外国艺术的许多影响。我们既要革新民族的和民间的艺术，在中国的音乐、舞蹈中有意识地吸收外国艺术的某些优秀的有用的成分，只要这种吸收不破坏原来的民族风格，这是完全应该的。如果有人创作新的艺术作品，企图冶中西于一炉，但是因为工夫没有到家，制作出来的东西，“不中不西”“中西混杂”，虽然不为大多数观众或听众所欢迎，但也未可厚非。应该让这个艺术家尝试再尝试，可能有一天他融会贯通，创造出一件完整的具有独特风格的艺术作品。
    但是，现在的许多“不中不西”现象的出现，却并不完全是由于这种缘故。相反地，往往是把原本为广大人民群众所爱好的相当完美的中国的传统的艺术作品，人为地加以肢解，而又勉强地加进许多西洋的东西，使它变成四不像。例如，对于楚剧，不问它的规律和特点，抹煞它的传统节目，否定它原来的唱腔曲调和表演方法，废除打击乐器，另作一套乐曲，强要把它改为“新歌剧”。对于有些民歌，不是寻求它原来的曲调，细致地进行整理加工，而是机械地套用西洋音乐的旋律加以“改编”。对于有些中国传统的歌舞节目，砍去许多优美的动作，加上西洋的芭蕾舞，而且只准舞而不歌，以致面目全非。如程云同志等所大为赞赏的某些作品，就是这种把中国的传统艺术作品搞得“不中不西”的典型实例。采取这种教条主义的方法来“以西改中”，不会创造出什么民族音乐、舞蹈的新形式，其结果将是“以西代中”、消灭中国传统的艺术。对于这样一种“不中不西”，大加提倡，好像是中国艺术的发展方向，这是我们所不能同意的。
    李凌同志特别提倡“移花接木”。他认为音乐语言很少受地域的限制，历史上向来进行移植，至于究竟谁移植谁的可以不去管它。他强调了艺术的世界性，否定了艺术的民族性。根据这种主张来进行“移花接木”，自然不是去发展艺术的民族风格和民族特点，而是要使它们按照西洋艺术的标准更加整齐划一，也就是成为李凌同志所说的人类共通的语言。大家知道，“移花接木”，总要砍掉一点什么，接上一点什么。这里的木当然是指的中国的木，花当然是指的西洋的花。所以，它的实际含意是：砍中国传统艺术的木，接西洋艺术的枝，开的“共通”的不伦不类花。这又是一种斫伤中国民族传统艺术的有效手法。事实上，有些人已经正在自觉地或不自觉地照着这个办法在做。可以想像得到，这样做的结果，将来无论在中国国内和世界大家庭中，将不是“百花齐放”，而是“一花独艳”。
    创造新的民族音乐形式是需要的。但应该在中国民族的和民间的音乐基础上来创造。离开中国的土壤，抹煞中国音乐的传统，机械地把西洋音乐移植过来，制造出来的将是外国的东西，而不是什么新的中国民族音乐。我们不是民族保守主义者，并不认为中国现有的艺术不能有所改动；我们是主张逐步地革新和发展中国的艺术的。在这种革新和发展中国艺术的过程中，必须以外国的优秀艺术作为借鉴和养料。但是当前最急要的事情，是要把中国民族的民间的艺术扶植起来，细心地加以栽培，使它根基巩固，枝叶茂盛，同时也就能够更好地吸收外国艺术的养料，逐步地使自己求得发展和提高。吸收外国的文化艺术，必须采取批判的科学态度，并且应该经过消化，决不能生吞活剥。因此，不能操之过急。否则，不但无补健康，反而会败坏中国的传统艺术。加紧融化，在事实上是行不通的；搞得不好，反而会消化不良，成为病态。
    （二）不要轻视和否定民族遗产
    轻视、排斥和否定民族传统和民族遗产的同志是有一套看问题的方法的。他们搬用了一条简单的公式：经济基础决定上层建筑，什么社会有什么艺术，经济基础改变了上层建筑必须跟着改变。从这一条定律出发，他们认为西洋的艺术是进步的、科学的，中国的传统艺术是封建的、落后的。因此，就必须以西洋艺术来改造中国的传统艺术，凡是不合乎西洋艺术的规律和格式的都应该加以排除。戏曲应该被淘汰或改为新歌剧；打击乐器是噪音乐器应该从此废止；民间唱法违反生理卫生原则应该代之以西洋唱法；载歌载舞不合于全面发展和专业分工的规章，应该分立门户……。一连串的粗暴作法都接踵而来。
    经济基础决定上层建筑是不错的。但是远在十九世纪九十年代，恩格斯在他的书简中已经指出：上层建筑一经形成，就有它的相对独立性，可以对于经济基础发生反作用。而且上层建筑的各个要素，包括文化艺术，在它的发展过程中有某种程度的继承性。他说：“历史思想家（历史一词在这里只是政治、法律、哲学、神学等概念的——总之，不只是有关自然界，而且是有关社会的一切领域的集合术语）在每一科学部门中都握有一定的材料，这些材料是由以前各代人的思维中独立形成的，并且在这些世代相继的人们的头脑中经过了自己独立的发展道路。”恩格斯并不反对对于某些东西的继承，相反地，他主张加以利用和改革。
    外国的艺术，因为经过资本主义社会，在苏联又经过了社会主义社会，许多经验都经过整理，已经系统化了，科学化了，足以为中国的借鉴。所以，我们提倡学习外国的优秀的艺术，特别是要向苏联和人民民主国家学习。
    但中国的民族的和民间的艺术并不都是封建的、落后的。在阶级社会中有两种不同的对立的文化。中国封建社会的文艺，有封建性的糟粕，也有民主性人民性的精华。在转入半殖民地半封建社会以后，特别是“五四”以来，有帝国主义的和封建主义的文艺，也有民主主义的和社会主义的文艺。后一种文艺往往表现出人民对于美好生活的渴望和幻想，表现出对于旧社会丑恶的现实的不满和反抗，表现出谋求民族独立和人民解放的不屈不挠的斗争精神。这是中国艺术的宝贵财富。除此以外，中国的传统艺术，经过历代劳动人民特别是艺术家的创造性的努力，积累了丰富的精湛的技术，有些技术后世艺术家都叹为绝技。这一部分是没有什么阶级性的，应该尽可能地接受和改进。中国的艺术，在某些方面是比西洋落后了，但也并不是一概都落后。因此，把民族遗产一笔抹煞是不正确的。
    中国的社会主义的文艺，不会是从天上凭空掉下来的。中国的文艺工作者，必须掌握民族的艺术遗产，接受其中一切有价值的东西，在新的条件下，加以改进和发展，才能创造出中国具有独特风格的艺术。毛泽东同志说过：“中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。”在人民自己掌握了政权的今天，我们文艺工作者更加应该尊重历史，注意继承和发扬民族传统和民族遗产。
    有这样一种说法：中国几乎没有音乐舞蹈的民族传统，历史上和现在的许多优秀艺术大都是从外间输入，这就进一步否定了民族传统和民族遗产。很显然的，这是一种非马克思主义观点，是对于历史的严重歪曲。音乐舞蹈是人民从劳动中创造出来的。中国在很古的时候，就有自己的音乐舞蹈。当然，这种传统的艺术是在不断地发展的，在发展的过程中吸收了一些外来的东西。汉、唐比较大量地吸收了外来的艺术，但当时这样作法是具有一定的历史条件的，而且也还是以中国传统艺术为基础来吸收的，不能因此而贬低中国传统艺术的地位。
    （三）思想感情要同人民群众
              打成一片
    每个民族的艺术都有它自己的民族风格和民族形式。这种民族风格和形式是在长期的历史过程中形成的。它适合于本民族劳动人民的生活习惯和民族性格，同广大的人民群众有着血肉的联系，为人民所熟悉所欢迎。这在艺术的演出的实践中可以经常得到证明，本民族的东西和外国的东西在人民群众中所引起的反应和效果，是有所不同的。许多优秀的传统的戏曲节目，群众百看不厌，就是因为它所表达的思想感情同人民群众息息相通，群众了解它、爱好它。我们提倡继承和发扬民族艺术传统，发掘和整理民间艺术，也是为了更好地联系群众，教育群众，使群众能够得到娱乐，以便更好地为社会主义服务。
    李凌同志提出了“百货中百客”的理论。程云同志作了进一步的发挥，说：“如果我们的人民今天还不是很普遍地习惯听‘交响乐’，将来一定也会习惯的”。“百货中百客”，这是不错的，所以我们并不排斥西洋艺术。但人们不禁要问：你卖的究竟是什么货色，中的是什么客人呢？这里不能说是一点区别也没有的。“交响乐”，今天已经有人爱好，将来也许会为人民所普遍地习惯，应该继续演奏。但将来终究是明天，今天对于六万万同胞又拿什么东西向他们交账呢？可见，李凌同志、程云同志的屁股还没有坐稳，他们的思想感情还没有同人民群众打成一片，“他们的灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级知识分子的王国”，他们企图以少数人的偏爱来代替多数群众的需要，他们太少考虑到使自己群众化，以便更好地接近群众，却要求群众更多地迁就他们。所有这些，是毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中所早就批判过了的。
    艺术上的民族化和群众化是密切结合的。真正热爱人民，热心地为人民服务，就一定要热爱自己民族的民间的艺术。轻视民族的民间的艺术，盲目地崇拜西洋，不管话说得如何动听，终必脱离人民群众。所以，归根到底，是一个立场问题。任何艺术家，要想真正成为人民的艺术家，对人民有更大的贡献，应该在思想感情上真正同人民群众打成一片。
    （四）怎样参加国际大家庭
    李凌同志的文章强调音乐语言的共通性、联系性。程云同志更明确地说：音乐创作的外国形式，“是国际大家庭所共有的，在世界音乐史上被各民族的音乐家所共同丰富起来的。更确切地说，谁能掌握它，运用它去倾吐自己民族的心声，并为本民族的人民所理解，所欢迎，它就是谁的。”
    提倡掌握和运用外国的音乐形式，这是没有人反对的。可是，李程两文大吹音乐的国际性，而忽视音乐的民族性；强调共性，否定个性；号召掌握外国的音乐形式，而不提倡发扬祖国的音乐传统，这就给人以崇西抑中之感，而且在道理上也说不过去。
    按常识说，国际大家庭是由各民族共同组成的。没有各个民族也就没有世界。音乐、舞蹈，在一定情况下，是有国际性的，但它同时又具有浓厚的民族性，也就是民族色采和民族风格。一个民族的音乐、舞蹈，不会同另一个民族的完全相同。贝多芬、萧邦是世界各国公认的音乐大师，但他们两人又的确分别地是德国的和波兰的优秀音乐家。他们是在祖国的土壤上，吸食人民的奶汁长大的。正因为国际音乐大家庭是由各民族的乐音组成，才能像今天这样彩色缤纷，姿态万千。
    中国是一个独立自主的国家，有几千年悠久的文化历史，有民族的传统的音乐舞蹈。中国对于国际大家庭，决不能抱消极的“拿来主义”的态度，以坐享国际大家庭现有的艺术形式为满足。中国在吸收外国艺术的同时，应该大大地发扬祖国的艺术遗产，创造具有独特的民族风格的音乐舞蹈，贡献于国际大家庭。这才是积极参加国际大家庭的正确的态度。历史证明：最富有民族色彩和民族风格的艺术，才是最有国际意义的。许多中国艺术代表团在国外演出的所以受到欢迎，重要原因之一也在这里。一个民族没有自己的民族风格的艺术，在国际艺术大家庭中是站不起来的。
    程云同志以冼星海和莫扎特为例，说明伟大的音乐家都是先学会了外国的东西，才写出真正具有民族色彩的作品。这也是武断的说法。我们并不否认某些音乐家在外国音乐中吸取了有益的养料；音乐家学外国东西是有好处的。但不能说，必先学好外国东西，才能写出民族色彩作品。如果那样，中国古代在外国音乐传入以前，就不会有自己的音乐家；中国的现在，民间就不可能产生杰出的音乐人才。这种先西后中，有西才有中的说法，暴露出程云同志的崇拜西洋、蔑视祖国的思想已经发展到了何等严重的程度。今天我们在防止民族保守主义的同时，必须着重地反对这种民族虚无主义的思想。
