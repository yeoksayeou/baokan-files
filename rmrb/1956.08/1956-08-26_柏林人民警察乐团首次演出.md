Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The Berlin People's Police Orchestra of the German Democratic Republic held its first concert in China tonight at the Capital Theater.

The German artists' outstanding performance was warmly appreciated by thousands of listeners. Elfriede Voss, the orchestra's soprano soloist, sang "Whenever I Think of Germany" and a selection from the opera "The White Haired Girl." Rudi Marx, the baritone soloist, sang "Song of Berlin" and a selection from "The Yellow River Cantata." Both were encored at the enthusiastic request of the audience. The audience particularly appreciated the orchestra's performance of "Warrior's Dance." This dance uses the theme of the German Peasants' War and incorporates Chinese musical harmonies and rhythms, giving it an Eastern musical flavor. It was specially composed by the German musician Jan Kurt Forester for the orchestra's performance in China. Before the performance, conductor Kaufmann, on behalf of Forester, presented the score of this dance to the artists of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

At the opening ceremony, Major General Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: Your wonderful program and outstanding artistic performance will undoubtedly greatly encourage and promote the cultural upsurge in our country guided by the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Conductor Kaufmann said in his speech: This is our first visit abroad, and we have come to your glorious country. The great Chinese people have gone through a magnificent and moving path to establish their own republic. We hope to bring back your rich experiences in all aspects to our country.

After the performance, General Xiao Ke, Vice Minister of National Defense, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ding Xilin and Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Ministers of Culture, went to the stage to shake hands with the German artists and express their gratitude.
