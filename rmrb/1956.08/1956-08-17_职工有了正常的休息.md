Workers Have Regular Rest
Zhang Wei

The Tiansheng Street Store of the Wuhan Retail Company has implemented a cross-shift system since April, with each worker working only eight hours a day, while the business hours are fifteen hours, ensuring workers have regular rest and also making it convenient for the public to purchase goods.

The Tiansheng Street Retail Store is a relatively large food and grocery store with busy business and closes later than general stores. In the past, when the cross-shift system was implemented, salespersons took turns on duty individually. When business was busy, those who were supposed to get off work could not, and everyone had to extend their work for two or three hours after closing to do accounting and other work. Therefore, they always got off work at eleven or twelve o'clock in the evening, and each person's actual working hours were more than fourteen hours. Because of the long working hours, the salespersons were exhausted and even dozed off at the counter. Usually, everyone had no time or energy to study business and could not complete the sales plan in a balanced way. The store also had to hold five scheduling meetings every week to mobilize everyone to think of ways, which increased everyone's fatigue. In order to reduce the working hours of salespersons, since April, they have implemented a cross-shift system according to the daily sales busy and idle patterns in the store. Each shift is scheduled to work nine hours (actually eight hours excluding meal time). The specific arrangement of duty time is: Shift A from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm, and from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm; Shift B from 1:00 pm to 10:00 pm. Shift A's rest time is from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm, and Shift B's rest time is from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm. With this arrangement, during the busiest time for the food counter from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, all ten people from both shifts are on duty, with six or seven people receiving customers, one person collecting money, and two or three people doing packaging, sorting, and adding goods, etc. This not only ensures sufficient manpower to serve customers but also allows for cleaning up goods during business hours. At the same time, most people go to work and get off work at the same time, which is convenient for mutual supervision and prevents uneven distribution of work; the balanced strength of the two shifts also allows for inter-shift competitions. Under the unified allocation of the entire store, each person also takes turns to rest one day a week.

Since the implementation of the two-shift system, the employees of this store have been wiping counters and tidying up goods at any time, keeping the entire counter environment and goods clean. The service attitude of the salespersons has also greatly improved.

    职工有了正常的休息
    张碨
    武汉市零售公司天声街商店，从四月份起实行了交叉两班制，每个职工每天只工作八小时，而营业时间达十五小时，保证了职工正常休息，还便利群众购买。
    天声街零售商店是个比较大的食品杂货店，业务繁忙，关门时间比一般店铺晚。过去实行交叉轮班制的时候，营业员每天是个别轮流上班，业务一忙，该下班的不能下班，大家还要到关门之后延长二、三小时做清理账目等工作，所以他们每天总在晚上十一、二点下班，每人实际工作时间在十四小时以上。因为工作时间长，营业员精疲力尽，甚至在柜台上打瞌睡。平时，大家没有时间和精力研究业务，不能均衡地完成销售计划。店里每星期还要开五次调度会，动员大家想办法，更增加了大家的疲劳。为了减少营业员的工作时间，从四月起，他们根据店内每日销货忙闲规律，实行了交叉两班制。每班规定九小时工作（除吃饭时间实际上是八小时）。具体安排的值班时间是：甲班早上七时至中午一时，下午六时至晚九时；乙班中午一时至晚上十时。甲班休息时间为下午一时至六时，乙班休息时间为上午七时至中午一时。这样安排后，在食品柜营业最忙的下午六至九点，两班十人全体上班，抽六、七人接待顾客，一人收款，二、三人搞包装、整理、添货等工作，这样既有充分人手招待顾客，又能利用营业时间作清理货物工作。同时，多数人同时上下班，便于互相监督，防止劳逸不均；两班力量均衡，还可展开班际竞赛。全店职工在统一调配下，每人每星期还轮流休息一天。
    这个商店自实行两班制以来，职工们随时擦货柜、整理货物，使整个柜内环境和货品保持清洁。营业员们的服务态度也大有改进。
