　　Just Seeing Movies for Free
　　Currently, our city of Andong still has a system of leaders "inspecting movie films," which means that whenever a good movie comes out, the leaders go to "inspect the films." In reality, as far as I know, they have never found anything of note through these inspections. Moreover, "leaders" in small and medium-sized cities like ours shouldn't have this authority; it's simply seeing movies for free.

　　This free movie-watching is also done with complete justification. They get to enter before other viewers, take the best seats, and also have many "leader standby tickets" specifically for their wives, children, and close relatives to come and "inspect" the films.

　　I think this is a very bad phenomenon, not only having a negative impact among the masses but also reducing state revenue. If they want to see movies, it's best to spend a few cents.　Antong　Keqi

    只不过是白看电影
    目前我们安东市仍然存在着首长“检查电影片子”的制度，就是每当来一个好电影的时候，首长们都去“检查片子”。其实，据我所知，他们从来也没检查出来个什么名堂。而且，像我们这样中小城市的“首长”们也不应当有此权限，这只不过是白看电影而已。
    这种白看电影还都是理直气壮的。他们要比别的观众先入场，坐好座，同时还备有好多“首长机动票”，专门供一些人的妻子儿女和至亲好友前来“检查”之用。
    我觉得这是个很不好的现象，不仅在群众中影响不好，也使国家减少了收入。如果愿意看电影，最好花上几角钱。　安东　克岐
