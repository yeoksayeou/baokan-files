    Over 7,000 Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Practitioners in Hebei Province Go Deep into Disaster Areas to Carry Out Medical Relief Work
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Since the Hebei Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on August 9 to rapidly carry out emergency medical work in disaster areas, the vast number of medical personnel throughout the province have been mobilized. As of August 25, 7,392 practitioners of traditional Chinese and Western medicine had formed medical teams and groups, and successively arrived in various disaster-stricken areas to carry out medical relief work.
    After the medical teams went deep into the disaster areas, they conducted health propaganda and education, guided the disaster victims to appropriately carry out environmental sanitation and drinking water disinfection, and actively conducted mobile medical services. In about ten days, twenty-two counties, including Boye, Qingyuan, Wuji, and Daming, provided free treatment to more than 320,000 patients. The vast number of people in the disaster areas are very grateful for the care shown to them by the Party and the government.
    In the course of their medical relief work, the medical personnel highly promoted the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded. Many medical personnel waded through water to treat patients during the day and slept on the muddy ground at night, eating and living with the disaster victims, and expressed that they would never give up until they had overcome the disaster and diseases.

    河北七千多名中西医
    深入灾区开展医疗救护工作
    本报讯　自8月9日河北省人民委员会发出迅速开展灾区卫生急救工作的指示后，全省广大医务人员已纷纷动员起来，到8月25日止，已有七千三百九十二名中西医务人员分别组成了医疗队和医疗组，并先后到达各受灾地区开展医疗救护工作。
    医疗队深入灾区后，一面进行卫生宣传教育，指导灾民适当开展了环境卫生和饮水消毒工作，一面积极进行巡回医疗。博野、清苑、无极、大名等二十二个县，在十天左右即免费治疗病人三十二万多人。广大灾区人民十分感激党和政府对他们的关怀。
    医疗人员在进行医疗救护工作中，高度发扬了救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，很多医务人员白天涉水治病，夜晚睡在泥地上，和灾民一起吃，一起住，并且表示不战胜灾荒和疾病决不罢休。（王力夫）
