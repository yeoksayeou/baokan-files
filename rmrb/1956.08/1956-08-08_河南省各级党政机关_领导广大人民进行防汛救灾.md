Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th. Party and government organs at all levels in Henan Province are vigorously leading the broad masses in fighting against the disasters caused by typhoons and rainstorms.

Before the arrival of the typhoon, all parts of Henan Province had done preventive work, but because the typhoon was too strong and the rainstorms were unusually heavy, great losses were caused under irresistible human forces. According to incomplete statistics from the Xuchang area up to the 6th, more than 60,000 houses collapsed, two people died, 214 people were injured, 14 head of livestock died, 39 head of livestock were injured, and 3.9 million mu of land were flooded. At the same time, the loss of crops in this area was also very large. 60% of the sorghum was flattened, and 5% to 10% of the heads were broken. In the Xinyang area, more than 220,000 trees were blown down, and more than 1.4 million jin of wheat straw was blown away. The typhoon and rainstorms also brought about a sharp rise in the water level of various rivers, and the flood situation was tense.

Party and government organs at all levels in Henan Province actively led the people in fighting against the disaster before the arrival of the typhoon and after the appearance of the typhoon and rainstorm. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a special meeting on the 4th to study flood prevention work and issued instructions on flood prevention, emergency rescue, drainage, seedling rescue, and striving for a bumper autumn harvest. On the 5th, the Henan Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on seizing the gap between rain stops and water drops to do a good job in flood prevention and disaster relief. On the night of the 4th, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formed a working group, carrying two radios and two rubber boats, to go to the junction of the Zhanghe River and the Weihe River in Neihuang County to assist local agencies in monitoring the water situation, resettling disaster victims, and leading the masses in emergency rescue. On the 6th, Shi Xiangsheng, Deputy Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor of Henan Province, led a condolence group to the disaster areas in northern Henan to express condolences to the disaster victims and assist in flood prevention and disaster relief. The Henan Provincial Department of Health sent two medical teams to the disaster area on the 5th. On the 6th, the Henan Provincial People's Committee allocated 390,000 yuan in emergency relief funds to the Anyang area, Xinxiang area, and Kaifeng City. Local party committees, administrative offices, and county-level leading cadres actively led flood prevention and emergency rescue work. The Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China had four members and the commander of the Kaifeng Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army leading 80 cadres to go down to lead disaster relief and flood prevention. As of the 6th, 31,460 households and 123,937 people have been rescued. The rescued disaster victims have been properly resettled, and the disaster victims in urgent need of relief have received relief.

Various localities have also done a lot of rescue and follow-up work on autumn seedlings.

    新华社郑州7日电　河南省各级党政机关正在大力领导广大群众同台风暴雨所造成的灾害作斗争。
    在台风到来以前，河南省各地就做了防范工作，但是因为台风过于猛烈，暴雨异常急骤，在人力不可抗拒的情况下，造成了很大损失。据许昌专区到六日止的不完整统计，房子倒塌六万多间，死两个人，伤二百一十四人，死牲口十四头，伤牲口三十九头，淹地三百九十万亩。同时，这个专区的农作物的损失也很大。高粱倒伏了60％，断头的达5％到10％。信阳专区刮倒树二十二万多株，刮跑麦秸一百四十多万斤。台风暴雨还带来了各河流的水位暴涨，汛情紧张。
    河南省各级党政机关在台风到来之前和台风暴雨出现后，积极领导人民同灾害搏斗。中共河南省委员会在四日召开专门会议，研究了防汛工作，发出了防汛抢险排水救苗争取秋季丰收的指示。五日，河南省人民委员会发出抓紧雨停水落间隙搞好防汛救灾的指示。四日夜，中共河南省委员会组成工作组，携带电台两部，橡皮船两只，赴内黄县漳河和卫河交汇处协助当地机关监视水情，安置灾民，领导群众抢险。六日，中共河南省委副书记、河南省副省长史向生又率领慰问团到豫北灾区慰问灾民和协助防汛救灾。河南省卫生厅在五日派往灾区两个医疗队。六日，河南省人民委员会拨给安阳专区、新乡专区、开封市三十九万元急救款。各地委、专署和县级领导干部都积极领导防汛抢险工作。中共开封地委有四个委员和人民解放军开封军分区司令员率领八十名干部分头下去领导救灾和防汛。到六日止，已抢救出31，460户123，937人。抢救出的灾民，都得到了适当的安置，急需救济的灾民都得了救济。
    各地对秋苗也做了许多抢救和善后处理工作。
