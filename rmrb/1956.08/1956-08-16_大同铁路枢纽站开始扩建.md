    Expansion of Datong Railway Hub Station Begins
    (This newspaper dispatch) The Datong Railway Hub Station project in Shanxi Province commenced on July 19th.

    Datong Station is located at the intersection of the Beijing-Baotou Railway and the Datong-Puzhou Railway. It is a transportation artery for Hebei, Shanxi, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and a crucial marshalling station for international through transport between China and the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries. With the rapid development of industrial construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Shanxi region, as well as the increasing volume of import and export goods via the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway, by 1959, the workload of Datong Station will increase by more than double compared to the present, and by 1967, it will increase by more than three times compared to the present.

    The Datong Hub Station project includes: expanding the existing Datong marshalling station by one-third, building a new Datong West Station; constructing a double-track line between Datong Station and the suburban Pingwang Station, connecting Datong and Pingwang stations with Kouquan Station, located in the Datong coalfield, as a whole. After the completion of the Datong Hub Station, the throughput capacity will be increased by 2.5 times compared to the present. The station's signaling equipment will adopt an electrical "relay centralized interlocking system," which is rare in China's railways, fundamentally changing the backward state of the existing Datong marshalling station's equipment.

    This project mostly employs mechanized construction. The initial phase of the project will be completed in 1958. After the newly built Datong West Station is put into operation in 1957, it will play a significant role in supporting the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base and the Datong Coalfield, as well as enhancing economic and cultural ties between China, the Soviet Union, and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries.

### 大同铁路枢纽站开始扩建

    大同铁路枢纽站开始扩建
    本报讯　山西省境内的大同铁路枢纽站工程已在七月十九日开工。
    大同站位于京包线与同蒲线的交汇点上，是河北、山西及内蒙古自治区的交通孔道，又是我国与苏联和东欧人民民主国家国际联运必经的重要编组站。随着内蒙古自治区和山西地区工业建设的飞跃发展，以及我国经集宁—乌兰巴托铁路出入口物资的不断增长，到1959年，大同站的作业量将比现在增加一倍多，1967年将比现在增加二倍以上。
    大同枢纽站工程包括：把现有的大同编组站扩大三分之一，新建大同西站一个；大同站与郊区的平旺站间修建双线，使大同、平旺两站与位于大同煤田中的口泉站联成一体。大同枢纽站建成后，通过能力将比现在提高二点五倍。车站信号设备采用我国铁路罕有的电气“继电集中装置”，根本上改变了现有大同编组站设备落后的状态。
    这项工程大部采用机械化施工。近期工程在1958年完成，1957年新建大同西站部分投入生产后，对支援包头钢铁工业基地建设和大同煤田建设，以及增进中国、苏联和东欧人民民主国家间的经济、文化联系，将发挥重大的作用。
