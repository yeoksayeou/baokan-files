A column transmitted by local newspapers commenting.

    The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "The First Step in Deepening is Investigation and Research." The editorial said: In order to deeply promote the advanced producer movement, the Nanjing Railway Sub-bureau analyzed the completion of planned targets by all workers in the sub-bureau from a technical, ideological, and equipment perspective, identifying the reasons for both advancement and lagging behind. Based on this, they formulated plans for future work. By adopting this leadership method, the Nanjing Railway Sub-bureau discovered advanced experiences, identified key production areas and weak links, corrected previous one-sided views of some employees, and gained a clear understanding of how to assist those who were lagging behind. The Party's political work could also be more targeted. This proves that to implement concrete and effective leadership in work, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the objective and real situation, and to achieve this, systematic investigation and research must be conducted. Currently, the advanced producer movement in many factories and mines does not seem as vigorous as it was in the previous months, and some comrades believe that the movement has stagnated or ended, feeling unable to continue developing the movement deeply and persistently. In reality, they do not clearly understand the specific situation, which is also a result of a lack of investigation and research.
    The reason this experience is good is also because the use of this method can better implement the mass line. Currently, some production leaders do not have sufficient or specific understanding of each worker's completion of planned targets, technical operations, and ideological situation. They do not know what strengths these people have, nor are they clear about what aspects these people need assistance with; they are unaware or only vaguely aware of who has become advanced and who has fallen from the advanced level. In this way, it is difficult to effectively implement the requirement of "promoting the advanced and helping the backward," and the work always remains focused on a small number of people.
    The editorial said that investigation and research work must be done regularly, because the objective situation is constantly changing, especially the specific situation of the workers and masses in production, technology, and ideology, which is changing with each passing day. We should make investigation and research a regular task, constantly revising some outdated views based on new situations, and arranging work based on new situations.
    The editorial concluded that all factories can learn from the practice of the Nanjing Railway Sub-bureau. Within a certain period, conduct concentrated investigation and research on a certain aspect of the work according to the needs of the work. Once the situation is clarified and the problem is clearly studied, formulate measures and steps to solve the problem in response to the existing problems, and better rely on the masses to push the work forward.

### 深入领导的第一步是调查研究

    深入领导的第一步是调查研究
    南京新华日报以“深入的第一步是调查研究”为题发表了社论。社论说：南京铁路分局为了深入开展先进生产者运动，对全分局的工人完成计划指标的情况，逐个地从技术上，思想上、设备上进行分析，找出了先进和落后的原因，在这个基础上作出了今后进行工作的规划。南京铁路分局采取这种领导方法，先进经验被发觉出来了，生产关键和薄弱环节发现出来了，领导上原来对一些职工的片面看法被事实修正了，从何着手去帮助一些落后的同志也心中有数了，党的政治工作也能有的放矢了。这证明：对工作要实行具体有效的领导，就必须对客观的真实情况有充分的了解，而要做到这一点，就得进行系统的调查研究。目前许多厂矿企业的先进生产者运动，看起来没有前几个月搞得轰轰烈烈，有些同志便以为运动停顿了或者是结束了，觉得无从去深入持久地继续开展运动。其实，具体情况究竟怎样，心中并不明白，这也是缺乏调查研究的结果。
    这个经验之所以好，还在于运用这种方法可以更好地贯彻群众路线。目前有些生产领导者对每个工人完成计划的情况、技术操作情况和思想情况不够了解或是了解得不具体，那些人身上有些什么长处不晓得，那些人需要从那方面去帮助也不清楚；谁变先进了，谁又从先进的水平上落下去了，都茫然无知或是知道得很少。这样，就很难切实有效地贯彻执行“发扬先进，帮助落后”的要求，工作老是停留在少数人的身上。
    社论说，调查研究工作必须经常地做，因为客观情况经常在变化，特别是职工群众在生产上、技术上、思想上的具体情况更是日新月异。我们应该把调查研究作为经常的工作，不断地依据新的情况来修正一些已经过了时的看法，根据新的情况来安排工作。
    社论最后说，各厂都可以学习南京铁路分局这种做法。在一定的时期内，根据工作需要集中地调查研究某一方面的问题，一俟情况调查清楚，问题研究明确后，就针对存在的问题，拟定解决问题的措施和步骤，更好地依靠群众把工作推向前进。
