Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 28th: According to West German newspapers, after the West German ruling clique banned the German Communist Party, German Communists, with the support and cover of the broad masses of workers, heroically persisted in the struggle in many parts of West Germany.

The central organ of the German Communist Party, "Freies Volk" (Free People), has been republished underground. Its resumed issue carries the declaration of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, "The German Communist Party Must Exist! Abolish the Ban!"

According to West Berlin's "Der Tagesspiegel" (The Daily Mirror), a clandestine radio station of the German Communist Party, "Radio Free Germany," has also begun broadcasting a few days ago. It issues a call to battle to all workers and all patriotic democrats in West Germany every day.

The Saar regional organization of the German Communist Party held a mass rally in Saarbrücken on August 25 to protest the Adenauer government's ban on the German Communist Party. Those who participated in the rally unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the German Communist Party. Walsch, a Communist member of the Saar Parliament, delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that Social Democrats and trade union members should realize that fighting for the freedom of the German Communist Party is fighting for their own freedom, because Adenauer's ban on the German Communist Party is an attack on the basic rights of the West German people.

Laup and Schlott, two Communist village councilors in Berghausen, near Karlsruhe, attended the village council meeting as usual. The mayor of the village, the Social Democrat Wagner, said: "Out of the 2,500 voters in this village, 300 voted for these two Communist councilors. Their departure must wait until the next election." Zeitonbaur and Brunninger, two Communist city councilors in Munich, publicly stated that they would continue to work to represent the interests of the voters. They pointed out that the will of 30,000 voters cannot be erased.

In Hanover, when the police came to the "Continental Rubber Factory" to arrest the trade union representative, the Communist Weickmann, the workers immediately gathered to protect him, making it impossible for the police to achieve their goal. In front of another large factory in Hanover, workers scrambled to take leaflets from the hands of those distributing German Communist Party leaflets. At this time, the police came and wanted to arrest the leaflet distributors. But the workers immediately surrounded the leaflet distributors, and they quickly disappeared into the crowd.

    德国共产党人英勇坚持斗争
    党的机关报在地下出版　秘密电台开始广播
    新华社柏林28日电　据西德报纸报道，在西德统治集团禁止德国共产党以后，德国共产党人在广大工人群众的支持和掩护下，在西德许多地方英勇地坚持斗争。
    德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民报”已经在地下重新出版。它的复刊号上刊载了德国共产党中央委员会的宣言“德国共产党要存在下去！废除禁令！”
    据西柏林的“每日镜报”说：德国共产党的一个地下广播电台“德国自由广播电台”也已经在几天以前开始广播。它每天向西德全体工人和所有爱国民主分子发出战斗的号召。
    德国共产党在萨尔的地方组织8月25日在萨尔布鲁根召开了群众集会，抗议阿登纳政府取缔德国共产党。参加集会的人一致表示，坚决支持德国共产党的正义斗争。萨尔议会的共产党议员瓦尔施在会上发表了演说。他指出：社会民主党人和工会会员应该认识到，为德国共产党的自由而战斗就是为他们自己的自由而战斗，因为阿登纳取缔德国共产党是对西德人民基本权利的打击。
    卡尔斯卢厄附近的贝尔格豪森乡的两个共产党乡议员劳普和施洛特照常出席了乡议会。这个乡的乡长社会民主党人瓦格纳说：“在本乡的二千五百个选民中，有三百人投了这两个共产党议员的票。他们的去留必须等到下届选举时才能决定。”慕尼黑市的两个共产党市议员蔡顿保尔和布林宁格公开声明他们将为代表选民的利益而坚持工作。他们指出：三万选民的意志不能被抹杀。
    在汉诺威，当警察来到“大陆橡胶工厂”要逮捕工会代表共产党员威克曼的时候，工人们立刻聚集起来保卫他，使得警察无法达到目的。在汉诺威另一个大工厂的门前，工人们争着从散发德国共产党传单的人的手里接过传单来看。这时警察来了，想逮捕散发传单的人。但是工人们立刻把散发传单的人围在中心，他们很快地就消失在人群中了。
