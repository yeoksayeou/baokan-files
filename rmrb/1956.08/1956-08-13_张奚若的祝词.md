Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 12th. Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo sent a congratulatory message from Beijing entitled "Further Emphasize and Broadly Develop Children's Sports Activities" to celebrate the opening of the first National Children's Sports Meet.

The congratulatory message stated that since liberation, China's children's sports activities have undergone unprecedented and healthy development, and the physical fitness of the new generation has greatly improved. This first National Children's Sports Meet will be a comprehensive review of the achievements of children's sports activities in the past few years. The conference will further stimulate the enthusiasm and interest of the vast number of children in participating in regular physical exercise, and further promote all sectors of society to pay attention to and strengthen the work of children's sports.

The congratulatory message continued, "It should be admitted that there are still many problems in children's sports activities in our country. First of all, all parties still do not pay enough attention to the health and sports activities of children. In recent years, various places have mainly been engaged in sports activities for adults, and rarely organize sports activities for children separately. At the same time, children's sports activities cannot be well adapted to the characteristics of children, and often the requirements are too high and too urgent."

"Secondly, there is a lack of systematic research and proper solutions for the items, venues, equipment, and rules of children's sports activities. This invisibly restricts more children from participating in sports activities, and to a certain extent affects the health of children."

The congratulatory message concluded, "In the future, the following two points should be mainly noted in carrying out children's sports activities:

First, Party and government leaders at all levels, especially education administrative and sports departments, should further widely publicize the importance of children's sports activities and the principles and methods of carrying out children's sports activities, in order to make all relevant departments and people from all walks of life pay serious attention to it and support this work with practical actions.

Second, the development of children's sports activities must be adapted to the characteristics of children. First of all, we must pay attention to solving this problem from the teaching content of school physical education classes. In elementary schools, correctly implementing the currently compiled elementary school physical education syllabus (draft) after the start of school this fall can solve the problem of adapting to the characteristics of children; the teaching content of physical education classes in middle schools should also be improved as necessary. There are some problems in the implementation of the "Labor and Defense System" that require too high and too urgent requirements and are inconsistent with school physical education classes, which need to be reconsidered. At the same time, it is also necessary to improve the quality of physical education teachers and earnestly improve the teaching methods of physical education classes, so as to truly ensure the smooth implementation of teaching materials and achieve real results.

Secondly, all relevant departments should start researching and strive to propose a specification or standard for the items, venues, equipment, and rules of children's sports activities as early as possible, and should give better solutions to the equipment, venues, etc. of children's sports activities as much as possible.

    张奚若的祝词
    新华社青岛12日电　教育部部长张奚若从北京寄来以“进一步重视和广泛开展少年体育活动”为题的祝词，祝贺全国第一届少年体育运动大会开幕。
    祝词里说，解放以来，我国少年儿童的体育运动有了空前的、健康的发展，新生一代的体质有了很大提高。这次举行的全国第一届少年体育运动大会，将是对过去几年来少年体育活动的成绩的一次全面的检阅。大会将进一步激发起广大少年经常参加体育锻炼的热情和兴趣，并且进一步推动社会各方面重视和加强少年体育运动的工作。
    祝词接着说，应当承认，当前我国少年体育活动中还存在着不少问题。首先，是各方面对少年的健康和体育活动重视仍有不足。几年来各地主要是在搞成年人的体育活动，很少单独组织少年的体育活动。同时，少年的体育活动也不能很好地适合少年的特点，常常是要求偏高偏急。
    其次，是对少年体育活动的项目和活动场地、器材、规则缺乏系统的研究和妥善的解决。这样，无形中就限制了更多的少年参加体育活动，并且在一定程度上影响了少年的身体健康。
    祝词最后说，今后在开展少年体育活动方面主要应当注意以下两点：
    第一，各地党政领导特别是教育行政和体育工作部门要进一步广泛地宣传少年体育活动的重要性和开展少年体育活动的方针、原则和办法，以期使各有关部门以及社会人士一致认真地重视起来，并且以实际行动支持这项工作。
    第二，开展少年体育活动必须适合少年的特点。首先要从学校体育课的教学内容上来注意解决这一问题。在小学里，今年秋季开学后正确地执行目前已经编好的小学体育教学大纲（草案），就可以解决适合少年特点的问题；在中学体育课教学内容也要作必要的改进。推行“劳卫制”中存在着一些要求偏高偏急与学校体育课不一致等问题，需要重新考虑。同时，还要提高体育教师质量，切实地改进体育课的教学方法，以确实保证教材的顺利实施，并收到真正的效果。
    其次，各有关部门应当着手研究争取尽早地对少年体育活动的项目、场地、器材、规则提出一个规格或标准，并且要对少年体育活动的设备、场地等尽可能地给以较好的解决。
