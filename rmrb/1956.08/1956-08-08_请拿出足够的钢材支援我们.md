    Please Provide Us With Enough Steel Support

    The domestically produced automobile, which the people of the whole country have been waiting for, has been successfully trial-assembled on July 13th; formal production will begin in September. We are very excited. However, at the same time, we also think that what the motherland needs is not only the ability to produce cars, but more importantly, after the first car is produced, to be able to continuously produce high-quality cars.

    As we prepare for the formal production of automobiles, we have to worry about whether domestic steel can be supplied. We work in the die forging section of the forging workshop, and due to insufficient steel, production is intermittent, in a state of "starvation." In June, we started the huge die forging steam hammer and only worked for ten days before the steel billets were used up. In July, we only had enough steel billets for seven days. In August, our steel is also insufficient, and it is estimated that we are still short of seven days' worth of steel. The steel that has already been delivered is not complete in variety and the quality is not very good. Because of this, our forgings cannot meet the needs of processing automobile parts. This situation poses a threat to the mass production of automobiles.

    We sincerely hope that the steelworkers who have always stood at the forefront of the motherland's construction will extend a hand of friendship to help us overcome the difficulty of insufficient steel. We know that producing steel for automobiles involves many difficulties. The technical requirements for automobile materials are very complex, and our country has never manufactured them before. The existing equipment and technical capabilities of our country's steel plants are also insufficient. However, we believe that steelworkers in Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dalian, and Chongqing will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties and supply the steel we urgently need. We also hope that the relevant departments of the central government will promptly help steelworkers solve the difficulties in producing automobile steel.

    Currently, most of the steel we use is still supplied by our Soviet elder brother. In the future, we should achieve the goal of having domestic supply of the main steel, so as to ensure that production is carried out rhythmically. Therefore, we hope that the metallurgical industry department will quickly make a plan and quickly trial-produce the steel needed by the automobile industry that our country cannot yet produce.

    We guarantee that we will formally produce automobiles in September. We hope that our steelworker brothers can also quickly produce steel to support us.

### 请拿出足够的钢材支援我们

    请拿出足够的钢材支援我们
    全国人民盼望已久的国产汽车，已经在七月十三日试装成功了；九月份就要正式生产。我们感到非常兴奋。但是，同时，我们也想到，祖国需要的不只是能够生产汽车，更重要的是在生产出第一辆汽车以后，能够连续不断地生产出质量良好的汽车来。
    在我们准备正式生产汽车的日子里，我们不得不耽心国产钢材能不能供应得上。我们在锻工车间模锻工部工作，因为钢材不足，生产时断时续，处在“吃不饱”的状态中。六月份，我们开动巨大的模锻蒸气锤，只打了十天，就把钢胚打完了。七月份，我们只有够七天用的钢胚。八月份，我们的钢材也不够用，估计还缺少七天的钢材。已经运来的钢材，品种不全，质量也不很好。由于这样，我们的锻件也供应不上加工汽车零件的需要。这种情况，对大量生产汽车是一个威胁。
    我们衷心地希望一向站在祖国建设前列的钢铁工人们，伸出友谊的手，帮助我们克服钢材不足的困难。我们知道，生产出供汽车需要的钢材，是有不少困难的。汽车材料的技术要求很复杂，过去我国从来没有制造过，我国钢铁厂现有的设备和技术能力也不足。但是，我们相信，鞍山、抚顺、本溪、大连和重庆等地的钢铁工人，一定能够战胜这些困难，供应我们迫切需要的钢材。我们也希望中央各有关部门及时帮助钢铁工人解决生产汽车钢材中的困难。
    现在，我们使用的大部分钢材，还是靠苏联老大哥供应的。今后我们应该作到由国内供应主要的钢材，这样才能保证有节奏地进行生产。因此，我们希望冶金工业部门快点做出规划，从速试制我国还不能生产的汽车工业需要的钢材。
    我们保证，一定在九月份正式生产出汽车。希望我们的钢铁工人兄弟，也能赶快拿出钢材，支援我们。
