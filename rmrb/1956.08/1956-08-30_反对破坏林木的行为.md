    Opposing Acts of Damaging Forests
    Absolutely No Toleration of Illegal Logging of State-Owned Forests
    The state-owned forests in Dalingxia, Jindong, Xiaojindong, Yapopotang, Shaibeitan, Dajiang, and Baiguoshi townships in Qiyang County, Hunan Province, have abundant timber reserves and are a valuable asset of the country.
    However, some state organs in Qiyang County are violating state laws and openly illegally logging state-owned forests. For example, the Qiyang Tin Mine cut down more than 17,000 catties of timber in the state-owned pine forest in Dalingxia Township, Qiyang, on August 3, 1956. The Qiyang County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau cut down 338 state-owned pine trees to obtain "priceless" telephone poles. The Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Shaibeitan Township sent a note to the Forestry Bureau, stating confidently: "Our township needs 50 cubic meters of timber to build the township People's Committee's building. Even if the Forestry Bureau does not approve it, we will still cut it down." The Baiguoshi Township People's Committee has already cut down 32 state-owned fir trees to build houses. The Secretary of the General Branch of Dalingxia Township also wanted to cut down state-owned forests to build the township People's Committee's building, but was firmly stopped by the state-owned forest ranger stationed in the township. Guilin Agricultural Cooperative in the township cut down more than 1,000 state-owned mature trees on July 10th and did not receive any punishment. Under their influence, Baijiachang and other seven cooperatives and some individual farmers in the township have also cut down a lot of state-owned forests. We suggest that the leading organs in various places thoroughly mobilize the masses and earnestly shoulder the responsibility of protecting the country's forest resources. Those illegal acts of illegal logging of state-owned forests should be given serious and stern handling.

    Destroying Forests to Reclaim Land is Not Worth the Loss
    In Changhong Agricultural Cooperative, Huangzhong Township, Wanyuan County, Sichuan Province, everyone is saddened when they talk about destroying forests to reclaim land. The cooperative is surrounded by high mountains with steep slopes and exposed rocks. In March this year, Changhong Cooperative carried out large-scale land reclamation on steep slopes, cutting down the previously lush and lovely forests. The mountains were covered with trees lying horizontally and vertically. A total of more than 2,100 mu of land were reclaimed, resulting in the loss of more than 450,000 various large and small trees. When the Seventh Production Team destroyed forests to burn and reclaim land, they also burned down the house of a cooperative member, Tao Wenxue. Except for rescuing a cotton quilt, a piglet, and seven dou of grain, all other family property was burned, resulting in the inability of the Seventh Team members to go to work in the mountains for several consecutive days.
    After the forest was destroyed, soil erosion became more serious than in previous years. According to the report of Cooperative Director Zhao Guangyuan, in the past, very little silt flowed from the mountains into the fields at the foot of the dam. This year, after the land was reclaimed, the crops on more than 100 shi of land were washed away by water, and some were blocked by sediment. When reclaiming the land, more than 300 mu of trees that produced black and white fungus were also cut down, causing dissatisfaction among the cooperative members. Cooperative member Yi Yanfu said: "The trees that have been growing for decades were cut down after joining the advanced cooperative. When reclaiming the land, I said: 'Leave a few trees,' but the resident cadre said that I had rich peasant thoughts."
    According to later calculations, this cooperative's destruction of forests to reclaim land not only did not increase income, but actually lost money.
    Why did Changhong Cooperative destroy forests to reclaim land on steep slopes? One of the main reasons is that the county and district leading organs, when deploying production tasks, ignored the characteristics of mountainous areas and one-sidedly emphasized reclaiming land to increase grain production.

    The phenomenon of destroying forests to reclaim land continues to occur in some areas of Anhui Province. The Shuhe Agricultural Cooperative's Democratic Production Team in Dahe Township, Xiaotian District, Shucheng County, spent 2,000 workdays reclaiming 150 mu of land on a steep slope of 33 degrees, cutting down more than 200 pine trees with a circumference of 8 inches to 1.5 feet. The Fuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaoyao Township, Jixi County, destroyed 50 mu of forest land, cutting down 90 pine trees with a circumference of 1.4 to 3 feet, and more than 1,000 miscellaneous trees with a circumference of 2 to 3 feet. In Laotian Township, Qingyang County, the masses burned mountains to reclaim more than 1,000 mu of land on steep slopes in places such as Daguling.
    Originally, the provincial leading organs had stipulated that all slopes above 25 degrees should be designated as forest land and no longer reclaimed. For land below 25 degrees, one mu of terraces should be built for every mu of land reclaimed. Unfortunately, the leading organs in some areas have forgotten this important regulation.

    Grew Grain, Lost the Forest
    Farmers in the mountainous areas of Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, have traditionally had the habit of "intercropping forests and grain." Last year, the area of intercropping forests and grain was more than 10,000 mu, and most of them achieved bumper grain harvests and completed afforestation tasks.
    However, some places in Wuyuan County have a tendency to disregard conditions and blindly promote intercropping forests and grain. This year, the county planned to promote 130,000 mu, and by April, a total of 80,000 mu had been opened. In some places, serious deforestation occurred during the promotion. In more than half of the 80,000 mu of mountain land opened in the county, there were forests. Particularly serious was the felling of entire young fir forests and valuable economic forests such as oil tea, bamboo, and tea trees. Even the hundreds-year-old water source scenic forests were cut down. Only corn was planted on the bare mountains where forests were cut down, and no trees were planted. Taking the three forestry and agricultural cooperatives of Baishiyuan, Hongyuan, and Fengshan as examples, more than 5,000 mu of mountain land were reclaimed for intercropping forests and grain, of which more than 4,000 mu were forested land. Baishiyuan Cooperative cut down more than 20,000 mature fir trees in addition to oil tea, bamboo, and miscellaneous trees. This phenomenon has led to serious consequences of farmland being eroded. In Fengshan Township, due to only planting mountains without afforestation in the past, the river water changed from clear to turbid during the 1955 flood, destroying more than 160 mu of paddy fields.
    The deviation of intercropping forests and grain in Wuyuan County has been inspected, and the relevant departments of the province have notified all localities to pay attention. However, this lesson is worth paying great attention to.　　Liu Gengnong
    It is Wrong to Skin Trees Alive
    In the Yitulihe area of ​​the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, recently some people have been stripping the bark of birch trees on the edge of dense forests in order to prepare fuel for the winter, and some trees have been peeled for two to three meters. About 80% of the birch trees around Yitulihe are without bark. Some branches and leaves are withered and yellow, and some are about to die. Seeing this phenomenon is really heartbreaking. Some people, for their own convenience, casually destroy the country's forest resources, which is really too wrong. Relevant departments should stop this act of destroying forests.　　　Yong Gen

### 反对破坏林木的行为

    反对破坏林木的行为
    决不容许盗伐国有林
    湖南省祁阳县大岭下、金洞、小金洞、鸭婆凼、晒北滩、大江、白果市等乡的国有林，木材蓄积量相当丰富，是国家的宝贵财富。
    但祁阳县的一些国家机关，竟违犯国法，对国有林进行公开盗砍。如祁阳锡矿，在1956年8月3日在祁阳大岭下乡的国有松林中砍材一万七千多斤。祁阳县邮电局为了取得“无价”的电杆，砍伐国有松树三百三十八棵。中共晒北滩乡总支书记给林管局送来一张便条，理直气壮地写道：“我乡要木材五十立方公尺修乡人民委员会的房子，林管局不批，我们也要砍。”白果市乡人民委员会为了修房子，已经砍下国有杉木三十二棵。大岭下乡总支书记也要砍国有林来修乡人民委员会的房子，被驻乡的国有林看管员坚决制止。该乡桂林农业社于七月十日砍掉国有成材林一千多棵，没受到任何处分。在他们的影响下，该乡百家场等七个社和一些单干农民也砍了不少国有林。我们建议各地领导机关深入发动群众，把保护国家森林资源的责任认真地担负起来，对于那些盗伐国有林的非法行为，应该给以认真、严肃的处理。

    毁林开荒，得不偿失
    在四川万源县黄钟乡长虹农业社，提起毁林垦荒的事来真是人人伤心。这个社的四周都是高山，坡度很陡，岩石裸露。今年3月间，长虹社在陡坡大事垦荒，把以前葱绿可爱成片的森林都砍掉。砍得满山遍地都是横七竖八的树木。总计共垦荒二千一百多亩，损失各种大、小树木四十五万余株。七生产队毁林烧垦的时候，还烧毁了社员陶文学的房子，除抢救出一床棉絮、一只小猪、七斗粮食外，其余家产全部烧光，结果使七队社员连续几天没能上山做活路。
    毁林以后，水土流失比往年严重起来了，据社主任赵光元报告，往年，山上的泥沙很少流在坝下的田里，今年垦荒后，却有一百多石田的庄稼被水冲了，有的被泥沙壅塞了。垦荒的时候，还把三百多亩生产黑白木耳的树也砍光了，引起社员不满。社员易延富说：“好几十年的树，入了高级社，被砍光了。垦荒的时候，我说：留几根树吧，驻社干部还说我有富农思想。”
    根据后来的计算，这个合作社毁林开荒不但没有增加收益，反而亏了本。
    长虹社为什么会在陡坡上毁林垦荒呢？主要原因之一，是县区的领导机关在布置生产任务上，忽视山区特点，片面强调开荒增产粮食。　　　　　　　江沥
          ×××
    安徽省有些地区毁林开垦的现象不断发生。舒城县晓天区大河乡舒河农业社民主生产队花了两千个工，在三十三度的陡坡上开垦一百五十亩，砍去八寸至一尺五寸围的松树二百多株。绩溪县逍遥乡复兴农业社毁林地五十亩，砍倒一尺四寸至三尺围的松树九十株，二尺至三尺围的杂树一千多株。青阳县老田乡群众在打鼓岭等处的陡坡上烧山开荒一千多亩。
    本来，省的领导机关曾经规定：凡是二十五度以上的坡地，应划为林地，不再开垦。二十五度以下的土地，也要做到开一亩荒，做一亩梯田，可惜，有些地区的领导机关把这一重要的规定忘记了。
                              以正
    种了粮，丢了林
    江西省婺源县山区农民历来有“林粮混作”的习惯。去年林粮混作的面积有一万多亩，多数获得粮食丰收，并且完成了造林任务。
    但是，婺源县有些地方在推广林粮混作中，有不顾条件、盲目推广的偏向。今年全县计划推广十三万亩，到4月共开了八万亩。某些地方在推广中发生了严重的毁林现象。在全县所开的八万亩山地中，有半数以上是有林木的。特别严重的是砍掉了成片的幼杉林和有价值的油茶、竹子、茶叶等经济林木，甚至几百年的水源风景林也被砍掉了。在砍伐了森林的光山上只种玉米，没有栽上树木。以白石源、洪源、凤山等三个林农社为例，为了实行林粮混作开垦了山地五千多亩，其中有林地就有四千多亩。白石源社除砍伐油茶、竹子、杂木外，还砍伐了成材杉树二万多根。这种现象带来农田被冲刷的严重恶果。凤山乡由于过去只种山不造林，1955年洪水期间河水由清变混，冲毁水田达一百六十多亩。
    婺源县林粮混作的偏向，经过检查后，省有关单位已经通报各地注意。但是，这个教训是值得十分重视的。　　刘耕农
    不该活剥树皮
    内蒙古自治区伊图里河地区，近来有些人为了准备冬季引火燃料，竟在茂密的森林边剥取桦树皮，有些树被剥皮长达二至三公尺。伊图里河周围约80％的桦树都没了皮。有的枝叶枯黄，有的快要死亡。看到这种现象，实在令人痛心。有些人为了自己的一点小方便，竟随便破坏国家森林资源，真是太不应该了。有关部门应当制止这种破坏森林的行为。　　　永根
