    Thoughts on Planting Trees
    Pingfan
    The Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory's Machine Shop recently conducted an inspection of the promotion of advanced experiences and discovered that none of the ten advanced experiences that had been promoted had been consolidated. Among them, the "Zhen Darova Work Method" had already failed, and the workers said, "The Zhen Darova Work Method has returned to its home country." The "facing-up cutter row's" cutter row is also nowhere to be found.
    This cannot help but remind people of planting trees. Planting trees is easy; you just dig a pit, insert the sapling, and bury it with soil. But if you want the tree to survive, take root, grow branches and leaves, bloom and bear fruit, you must also weed, loosen the soil, water, fertilize, prune... and do many other things.
    Promoting advanced experience is like planting trees. Planting trees cannot be a matter of simply inserting them; promoting advanced experience, of course, cannot be a matter of "simply promoting." We must regularly care about and check the promotion of advanced experience, understand and solve the difficulties in promoting advanced experience, in order to effectively unleash potential; otherwise, no matter how many dozens, or even hundreds, of advanced experiences are promoted, the number may be large, but it is actually not very useful.

    想到了栽树
    平凡
    上海中国纺织机械厂机工车间，不久以前检查了一次先进经验的推广情况，发现已经推广了的十种先进经验，都没有巩固下来；其中“真达罗娃工作法”已经流产，工人们说：“真达罗娃工作法回国去了。”“朝天刀排”的刀排也不知去向了。
    这不由得令人想起栽树来。栽树很容易，只要挖个坑，插上苗，埋上土就行了。但要让树能活下去，扎下根来生枝长叶，开花结果，还必须锄草、松土、浇水、施肥、整枝……做许许多多工作。
    推广先进经验好比栽树。栽树不能一插了事，推广先进经验，当然不能“一推了事”。要经常关心和检查先进经验的推广情况，了解和解决推广先进经验中的困难，才能有效地发挥潜力；否则，不管推广几十条，乃至几百条先进经验，数字虽大，其实是用处不大的。
