    Learn from Each Other's Strengths, Help Each Other Overcome Difficulties:
    The Mutual Assistance and Learning Activities of the Lüda Mechanical Factories Are Well Organized
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Lüda City Committee of the National First Machine Building Trade Union has been paying attention to strengthening the technical experience exchange activities among the mechanical factories in Lüda City, and using inter-factory mutual assistance and learning methods to solve technical problems in production.
    In June of this year, the Lüda City Committee of the National First Machine Building Trade Union organized eight mechanical factories, including the Dalian Shipbuilding Company and the Dalian Crane Factory, to sign inter-factory mutual assistance and learning contracts. Any unit participating in the contract should, if it has mastered new technologies or has better technical experience, impart them to others without reservation; if it encounters technical problems in production that it cannot solve itself, it can also actively request assistance from brother factories. The contract stipulates that in a relatively short period of time, through mutual assistance and learning, twenty-two key production technology problems should be solved and twenty-nine advanced experiences should be promoted in these eight factories. This approach has been very effective. For example, the technical level of the foundry workshop of the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory was low, and it lacked experience in casting cylinder liners, with a scrap rate of 60%. However, the Dalian Shipbuilding Company, with the long-term assistance of Soviet experts, had accumulated experience in casting cylinder liners. Therefore, the Dalian Shipbuilding Company went to assist the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory. As a result, the scrap rate of cylinder liners at the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory was reduced from about 60% to about 2%. Similarly, the Dalian Shipbuilding Company lacked experience in producing metal retaining bands, and sometimes almost all of them were scrapped. However, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory was very experienced in producing this kind of thing. After the Dalian Shipbuilding Company learned about this, it quickly went to learn from their experience. Now the Dalian Shipbuilding Company also rarely produces scrap metal retaining bands. In the past, the Dalian Electrical Machinery Factory always found that a certain type of motor housing was deformed, mainly because the core was not hung correctly. After the Dalian Machine Tool Factory taught them the experience of a funnel core box, this problem was quickly solved.
    Now, the atmosphere of mutual assistance and learning and mutual observation is getting stronger day by day among the mechanical factories in Lüda. Some factories actively help others. For example, the life of the furnace cover of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company only reached 20 times, while the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory could reach more than 100 times. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory sent two of its best skilled workers to the shipbuilding company for a week of practical guidance. Now the life of the furnace cover of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company has reached more than 70 times. The joint state-private Mechanical Factory No. 5 lacked experience in producing waterwheels and found it difficult to complete its production tasks. However, after learning from the experience of the local state-owned Lüda Agricultural Machinery Factory, it not only completed the plan but also overproduced 150 units. At present, the mutual assistance and learning activities between factories are actually no longer limited to the factories and projects stipulated in the contract.
    The Lüda City Committee of the National First Machine Building Trade Union has also organized some experienced workers and technicians from various mechanical factories to form an advanced experience guidance group for foundry workers and an advanced experience guidance group for machining. The scope of activities of these guidance groups is even wider. More than 30 mechanical factories in Lüda (including state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private) have mostly participated in these groups. The responsibility of these groups is to help various factories overcome technical difficulties encountered in promoting advanced experience and to assist in solving certain technical problems in production. These guidance activities are not bound by contracts, and each factory can raise problems that need to be solved at any time and request assistance. For example, a certain type of pipe with three bends at the Dalian Universal Machinery Factory was difficult to cast, and the advanced experience guidance group for foundry workers held a meeting to study and help find a solution. Now everyone has proposed more than a dozen plans to improve the casting method. When the Lüda Metrology Instrument Factory encountered difficulties in promoting the Kolesov lathe tool experience, Qiu Huazhong, a technician from the Dalian Crane Factory in the advanced experience guidance group, personally went to the Metrology Instrument Factory to help promote it, enabling the turners of this factory to quickly master this technology.
    It can now be preliminarily seen that the technical exchange and mutual assistance activities among the mechanical factories in Lüda City have the following advantages: First, it enables the factories to better learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, so that all factories can generally reach a relatively advanced level. Second, concentrating the wisdom of relevant skilled workers and technicians from various factories to help a certain factory solve key problems in production in a timely manner plays a significant role in ensuring the completion of current production tasks. Third, at present, each factory has insufficient technical strength. This method can overcome some of the difficulties of insufficient technical strength. (Mao Xianzhi)

### 有长处大家都来学习　有困难大家都来帮助  旅大各机械工厂互助互学活动搞得好

    有长处大家都来学习　有困难大家都来帮助
    旅大各机械工厂互助互学活动搞得好
    本报讯　中国第一机械工会旅大市委员会注意加强旅大市各机械工厂之间的技术经验交流活动，并且用厂际互助互学的办法来解决生产中的技术问题。
    今年六月，中国第一机械工会旅大市委员会就组织了大连造船公司、大连起重机器厂等八个机械工厂，签订了厂际互助互学合同。凡参加签订合同的单位，如果掌握了新技术或是有了较好的技术经验，就应该没有保留地传授给别人；如果在生产中遇到了自己不能解决的技术问题，也可以主动要求兄弟厂协助解决。合同中规定，要在较短的时期内，用互助互学的办法，在这八个工厂中，解决二十二项生产技术关键问题，并且推广二十九种先进经验。这种做法，收效很大。如大连柴油机厂铸造车间的技术水平较低，对铸造汽缸套缺乏经验，废品率达到60％。而大连造船公司却在苏联专家的长期帮助下，积累了铸造汽缸套的经验。因此大连造船公司就去协助大连柴油机厂。结果大连柴油机厂汽缸套的废品率就从60％降低到2％左右。同样，大连造船公司生产金属维带缺乏经验，有时几乎全是废品。而大连机车车辆制造工厂生产这种东西很有经验。大连造船公司知道以后，很快就去学习了他们的经验。现在大连造船公司生产金属维带也很少出废品了。大连电机厂过去生产一种电动机外壳总是变形，主要是芯子吊不正。大连机床厂教给他们一种漏斗芯盒的经验以后，这个问题就很快解决了。
    现在，旅大各机械工厂之间这种互助互学、相互观摩的空气一天天浓厚了。有些工厂主动地去帮助别人。如大连造船公司的炉盖寿命只达到二十次，而大连工矿车辆厂可以达到一百次以上。大连工矿车辆厂就派出两名最好的技术工人到造船公司进行了一个星期的实际辅导，现在大连造船公司的炉盖寿命已经达到了七十次以上。公私合营机械五厂缺乏生产水车的经验，生产任务很难完成，可是学习了地方国营旅大农业机械厂的经验以后，不仅完成了计划，还超额生产了一百五十台。目前厂和厂之间的互助互学活动，实际上已经不止是合同中规定的那些工厂和项目了。
    中国第一机械工会旅大市委员会还把各机械工厂一部分有技术经验的工人和技术人员组织起来，成立铸工先进经验辅导小组和加工先进经验辅导小组。这种辅导小组活动的范围更广泛。旅大市三十多个机械工厂（包括国营、地方国营和公私合营）大都参加了这种小组。这种小组的职责是帮助各厂克服推广先进经验时遇到的技术上的困难，并且协助解决生产中的某些技术问题。这种辅导活动不受合同的约束，各厂可以随时把需要解决的问题提出来请求协助。如大连通用机器厂有一种三个弯的管子不好浇铸，铸工先进经验辅导小组就开会研究，帮助想办法解决。现在大家已经提出了十多个改进浇铸方法的方案。旅大度量衡仪器厂在推广科列索夫车刀这一经验时遇到了困难，先进经验辅导小组中的大连起重机器厂的技术员丘华仲等人，就亲自到度量衡仪器厂去帮助推广，使得这个工厂的车工很快就掌握了这一技术。
    现在已经初步可以看出，旅大市机械工厂之间的技术交流互助活动有下列几点好处：第一，它使得工厂之间能更好地取长补短，使各个工厂可以普遍达到比较先进的水平。第二，集中各厂有关的技术工人和技术人员的智慧，帮助某一个工厂及时解决生产中的关键问题，对保证完成当前生产任务很起作用。第三，目前各厂技术力量都不足，用这个办法，就可以克服一部分技术力量不足的困难。（毛先智）
