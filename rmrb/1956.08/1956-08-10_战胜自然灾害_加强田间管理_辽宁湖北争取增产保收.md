Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th. Major autumn crops in agricultural production cooperatives in Liaoning Province are generally growing well. At present, the province's main crops, sorghum and corn, are five to six feet tall, with thick stalks and large ears; cotton has many branches and is laden with bolls, already one and a half feet tall; rice is also growing well; all 680,000 hectares of soybeans in the province are growing with large branches and lush leaves, and have already flowered and formed pods. According to estimates from various counties in the Tie嶺 (Tiě lǐng) Special District, the main soybean producing area, this year's soybean production may increase by about 40% compared to last year.

After entering the summer cultivation season this year, Liaoning Province experienced continuous cloudy and rainy weather, with weeds growing densely. In addition, the increase in paddy fields and densely planted crops made cultivation labor-intensive, resulting in a shortage of manpower and animal power. For a time, many places experienced a phenomenon of seedling scarcity. Pest infestations occurred frequently in some areas, and waterlogging disasters after rain seriously threatened the normal growth of crops. In order to adapt to the new situation of summer cultivation this year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions promptly adjusted their labor force and implemented a "small group contracting, individual piecework" remuneration method, which boosted the labor enthusiasm of the vast majority of cooperative members. In order to overcome the uneven progress of hoeing, some agricultural cooperatives in some regions also achieved mutual support between cooperatives and teams. Therefore, summer fields in various regions generally achieved three hoeings and three harrowings, overcoming the seedling scarcity.

After cutworms occurred in early summer, various regions immediately organized manpower to eliminate them. During the period of cotton aphid infestation in June and July, agricultural cooperatives in various regions used more than twice as much cotton pesticide as last year, achieving "detecting and eliminating at any time." Generally, pesticides were applied two or three times, preventing the spread of the pest. Recently, red spider mites have occurred in some cotton-producing counties, and various regions are actively carrying out prevention and control. In areas affected by waterlogging and hail disasters, local farmers also promptly carried out drainage to save seedlings and rush-planted late crops, greatly reducing the affected area.

While fighting against seedling scarcity and pest and waterlogging disasters, field technical management in various regions has also been strengthened compared to last year. New techniques of hitting the surrounding tips first and then the top tips have been widely promoted in cotton fields to promote more cotton boll formation. Many soybeans have been thinned by hand, and the amount of topdressing fertilizer in farmland has also increased compared to last year. In cornfields in Qingyuan, Yi County, Xin Jin and other counties, 90% have been topdressed, and some have even been topdressed two or three times. In addition, the abundant rainfall in summer has promoted the vigorous growth of crops.

At present, Party and government leading organs in various regions are paying attention to educating farmers to overcome the optimistic and relaxed mood that arises from seeing the good growth of the current crops. They continue to mobilize farmers to strengthen field management, vigorously prevent floods and waterlogging, and strive to carry out the movement to increase production and ensure harvests, in order to strive for the first bumper harvest after cooperativization.

Our newspaper, Hankou, 9th. Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province are launching a production increase movement. In the early and middle of July, some agricultural cooperatives in the Yichang Special District suffered from severe flash floods and hailstorms, and reduced production is already a certainty. The Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China led the agricultural cooperatives in these areas to expand the planting area of late autumn crops in accordance with local conditions and strive to harvest another season. At present, 30% of the increase in production planting plan has been completed in the whole region. The 120 production-reduced cooperatives in Dangyang, Xingshan, and Changyang counties have adopted methods such as expanding the planting area of late autumn crops, intercropping, and weeding seedlings to strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops. It is estimated that 36 cooperatives can increase production, and 41 cooperatives can guarantee the original output.

After discovering that 12% of the cooperatives in the whole area were not producing well, the CPC Enshi Prefectural Committee immediately convened a meeting of cadres from these cooperatives and an enlarged meeting of activists in the townships to discuss ways to strive for increased production and guaranteed harvests, and transferred a large number of cadres to these cooperatives to help with their work. Now the agricultural cooperatives in these areas are strengthening the cultivation of existing crops and developing diversified operations. The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Ganggoutang, Xuanen County, has organized 600 laborers to weed and topdress 1,200 mu of corn seedlings and rice seedlings. The CPC Xiangyang Prefectural Committee recently inspected the production of agricultural cooperatives in Zaoyang, Yicheng, Nanzhang, Baokang, Yun County, Yunxi and other counties, and found that the number of cooperatives with poor crop growth due to weak leadership backbone, reduced wheat season production, and lack of investment in autumn production accounted for about 6% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in these counties. The CPC Xiangyang Prefectural Committee immediately took emergency measures to reverse the decline in production in these cooperatives, quickly transferred cadres to strengthen the leadership of these cooperatives, provided loans to agricultural cooperatives that were unable to invest in production, carried out comprehensive classification management of existing crops, implemented intensive cultivation, and prevented natural disasters.

### 战胜自然灾害　加强田间管理  辽宁湖北争取增产保收

    战胜自然灾害　加强田间管理
    辽宁湖北争取增产保收
    新华社沈阳9日电　辽宁省各地农业生产合作社大秋作物普遍生长良好。现在，全省的主要作物高粱、玉米，都有五、六尺高，秆粗穗大；棉花杈多、结铃累累，已有一尺半高；水稻生长也很好；全省六十八万公顷大豆都长得枝大叶茂，已落花结荚。据主要大豆产区铁岭专区各县的估计，今年的大豆可比去年增产四成左右。
    辽宁省今年进入夏锄后，阴雨连绵，草苗齐长，加上水田和密植作物增多，耕作费工，形成人力和畜力不足，许多地方曾一度出现苗荒现象，部分地区虫害频发，雨后并出现了涝灾，使农作物的正常生长受到了严重的威胁。各地农业社为了适应今年夏锄的新情况，及时地调整了劳动力，实行了“小组包工，个人计件”的计酬办法，鼓舞了广大社员的劳动积极性。有些地区的农业社为了克服铲趟进度不平衡现象，还做到了社与社和队与队的互相支援。因此，各地夏田一般都作到了三铲三趟，战胜了苗荒。
    夏初发生夜盗虫后，各地都立即组织了人力予以扑灭。六、七月间，全省棉蚜为害的时候，各地农业社使用了比去年多一倍以上的棉药，做到了“随时发现，随时扑灭”，一般都打了两、三次药，制止了虫害蔓延。最近，有些产棉县份又发生了红蜘蛛为害，现在各地正积极防治中。在发生水涝雹灾的地区，当地农民也都及时地进行了排水救苗，抢种晚田，使受灾面积大大减少。
    各地在与苗荒和虫涝灾害斗争的同时，对于田间技术管理也比去年加强。棉田普遍推广了先打围尖、后打顶尖的新技术，以促进棉花多结桃。很多大豆实行了手间苗，农田的追肥数量也比去年有所增加。清原、义县、新金等县的玉米田，90％都追了肥，有的追肥还达到两、三次之多。加上夏季雨水充足，助长了农作物的旺盛生长。
    目前，各地党政领导机关都注意教育农民克服随着看到当前庄稼长的好而产生的乐观松劲情绪，继续动员农民加强田间管理，大力防汛防涝，努力开展增产保收运动，以争取合作化后第一个大丰收的到来。
    本报汉口9日电　湖北省各地农业生产合作社正在开展增产运动。七月上、中旬，宜昌专区有些农业社遭受严重的山洪和风雹灾害，减产已成定局。中共宜昌地委领导这些地区的农业社因地制宜地扩大晚秋作物播种面积，争取多收一季。目前，全区已完成增产播种计划的30％。当阳、兴山、长阳三县的一百二十个减产的社，采取扩大晚秋播种面积、间作套种、进行薅苗等办法，争取晚秋作物丰收，估计有三十六个社可以增产，有四十一个社能够保证原有产量。
    中共恩施地委发现全区生产不好的社占全区总社数的12％以后，立即召开了这些社的干部会议和乡扩大积极分子会议，讨论了争取增产保收的办法，并抽调大批干部到这些社去帮助工作。现在这些地区的农业社正加强对现有农作物的培育并开展多种经营。宣恩县干沟塘前进农业社，已组织了六百个劳动力将一千二百亩的苞谷苗和稻秧苗进行薅草追肥。中共襄阳地委最近检查了枣阳、宜城、南漳、保康、郧县、郧西等县的农业社的生产，发现因领导骨干弱、麦季减产、秋季无力投资生产，形成庄稼长得不好的社，约占这些县的农业社总数6％左右。中共襄阳地委立即采取扭转这些社的减产局面的紧急措施，迅速抽调干部，加强对这些社的领导，对无力投资生产的农业社给予贷款，将现有作物进行全面分类管理，实行加工培育，防止自然灾害。
