    Give Full Play to the Organizational Role of the Communist Youth League
    Lu Jindong
    (I)
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the "Instruction to Party Committees at All Levels on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over the Communist Youth League," Party committees at all levels have been continuously strengthening their leadership over the Communist Youth League, and the independent activities of the Communist Youth League have been carried out more widely. Therefore, the role of the League has become increasingly significant. However, at present, some county and district party committees still adopt the following incorrect methods in leading the work of the Communist Youth League and using the strength of the Communist Youth League: they only focus on a few full-time cadres of the League, and do not pay attention to mobilizing the vast number of League members and the masses; they only require the League cadres to do a good job in the central work, and do not ask about their professional work. For example, Comrade Guo Yupu, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Cangxian County, Hebei, was appointed as the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee on June 16, 1955, but he did not start doing part of the League's work until March of this year. What was he doing in the nine months before March? The day after he took office as the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, he was sent to the countryside to do central work, and later participated in locust control work. It was not until August of last year that he saw the news in the newspaper that the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League called on young people across the country to launch a campaign to reduce grain and cotton losses during the autumn harvest. After returning to the county, he asked the Party Committee how to respond to this call. However, the Party's County Committee Secretary sent him to participate in flood control work. After October, he was sent to the countryside to do conscription work. Before the conscription work was completed, he was transferred to prepare for diverting river water for irrigation. During this period, the Communist Youth League County Committee held a meeting of activists in socialist construction, and the Communist Youth League District Work Committee held a meeting of secretaries of the Communist Youth League County Committees, but he did not participate in either. Although there were two deputy secretaries in the Communist Youth League County Committee, they also could not do the League's work. None of the nineteen full-time cadres of the Communist Youth League in Xiangxiang County, Hunan, were engaged exclusively in the professional work of the League.
    League members and young people are demanding that the League organization strengthen its leadership over them and carry out independent activities of the League. They said to the League cadres: "The village is lifeless. There is no one to teach us to sing, no one to lead us to perform, and no one to guide the Young Pioneers in their team day activities. What should we do?" Most of the League cadres are also motivated, but they cannot find time to work, so they have to mobilize their subordinates and say: "Find loopholes, find tricks, and seize the time to hold a good meeting of League cadres." However, the demands of young people and the enthusiasm of League cadres often do not receive the support they deserve from their superiors. Some League cadres are even criticized by the Party Committee for actively carrying out independent activities of the League, saying that they have a "purely professional viewpoint." The Communist Youth League County Committee of Lingling County, Hunan, once wanted to hold a meeting to convey the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Communist Youth League Provincial Committee. They asked the Party Committee for instructions four times, but the Party Committee not only did not approve it, but also criticized the comrades of the Communist Youth League County Committee and asked them to write a written self-criticism.
    Wherever the Party Committee adopts the above-mentioned methods to lead the work of the Communist Youth League and use the strength of the Communist Youth League, the League's system of leadership is disrupted, the independent activities of the League are virtually cancelled, and the League organization falls into a state of "hemiplegia." This greatly weakens the organizational role of the League.
    (II)
    At present, we are trying to mobilize all positive factors to serve the construction of socialism. The strength of young people is of course also being mobilized, and it is "the most active and energetic part of the entire social force." The League committees at the county and district levels directly lead the grassroots organizations that connect with the broad masses of young people; among the League cadres, the cadres at the county and district levels account for the majority. Therefore, improving the leadership of the Party committees at the county and district levels over the Communist Youth League and giving full play to the role of the League's grassroots organizations are of great significance for improving the work of the League and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people.
    At present, the central link in improving the leadership of the Party committees at the county and district levels over the Communist Youth League is to change understanding and improve leadership methods.
    The role of the Communist Youth League cadres is to contact and educate the broad masses of young people through the League organization under the leadership of the Party, and to mobilize and lead them to fight for the realization of the Party's tasks. Only focusing on a few full-time cadres of the League and not paying attention to promoting the entire organization of the League will affect the League's connection with the young masses, weaken the organizational role of the League, and reduce the role of the League cadres. Of course, it is not impossible to transfer some League cadres to complete a certain important task; but the Party Committee should consider whether there is a real need for this when making such a decision. Under normal circumstances, in any case, the League cadres should not all be assigned to do central work, let alone be allowed to put down their professional work to do the professional work of other departments.
    It is not wrong to ask the League cadres to do a good job in the central work. However, it is wrong to pit the League's professional work against the central work and inappropriately accuse the cadres who ask to carry out the League's professional work of having a "purely professional viewpoint." Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, the strengthening of the League's system of leadership and the carrying out of professional work will not only not affect the central work, but on the contrary, because it can take care of the characteristics of young people and appropriately meet their requirements, it can give greater play to the enthusiasm of League members and young people and better complete the Party's central tasks.
    According to existing experience, the basic method for the Party Committee to lead the Communist Youth League to do a good job in the central work should be to always pay attention to giving the League Committee instructions in terms of principles and policies in a timely manner. In a certain period or in a major central work, put forward certain tasks and requirements to the League organization, give the League cadres enough time to carry out professional work, and guide them to arrange their work well, help them solve important problems in their work, and give them necessary encouragement and support, so as to enable them to mobilize all League members and the broad masses of young people through the League organization to complete these tasks. In this regard, the experience of the Party Committee of Lixian County, Hebei Province, in improving the leadership over the Communist Youth League, published in the China Youth Daily on April 18 this year, can be used as a reference. The Party Committee in this county had serious shortcomings in leading the work of the Communist Youth League in the past. It only emphasized the unified leadership of the Party and ignored the characteristics of young people, so the work of the League was not done well enough. However, in May last year, they studied the Party Central Committee's instructions on strengthening the Party's leadership over the Communist Youth League and improved their leadership methods. Since then, the League cadres have become more energetic, and the work of the League has become more active. Last year, the Communist Youth League County Committee led young people to complete more than 66,000 mu of artificial pollination of corn, which was more than double the total number of tasks assigned by the Party; this spring, it led young people to dig more than 4,500 wells, accounting for 75% of the total number of wells dug in the county.
    It is also the responsibility of the Party Committee to lead the Communist Youth League cadres to do a good job in the professional work of the League while doing a good job in the central work. The Party Committee should always care about the progress of the Communist Youth League cadres, help them improve their ideological level and professional ability, and improve and consolidate the League's system of leadership. Those cadres who have not been doing or are not at ease in doing the professional work of the League for a long time should be given criticism and education. In terms of absorbing League cadres to participate in or attend Party meetings and read Party documents and instructions, the Communist Youth League should be regarded as an independent work department and system, and appropriate care should be taken from the needs of the work, so that they can understand the intentions of the Party Committee in a timely manner and correctly deploy the work of the League. If the League cadres put forward unreasonable demands to the Party Committee, the Party Committee has the responsibility to explain and educate them, and should pay attention to cherishing their enthusiasm.
    (III)
    Improving the Party Committee's leadership over the Communist Youth League is of decisive significance for giving full play to the organizational role of the League, but it is not the only condition. The reason why the League's professional work in many places cannot be carried out is inseparable from the shortcomings in the League Committee's leadership. Some League cadres do not take the initiative to plan and arrange the work of the League. They do whatever the Party Committee tells them to do, and cannot raise questions and opinions, or they do not have the courage to raise opinions. There are also some League cadres who lack a pragmatic attitude and insist on doing things beyond their capabilities. For example, the Communist Youth League Committee of Jianping County, Liaoning Province, signed a contract with the Party Committee to contract production in three townships. In order to fulfill the requirements of the contract, the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Organization and Propaganda Ministers of the Communist Youth League County Committee all went to these three townships. This practice is obviously wrong. Since they have given up leading the work of the League in the whole county, it is naturally impossible for the League organization to play its due role in the entire central work. There are even a few League cadres who are not afraid of hard work in the central work (which is of course not wrong), but take a perfunctory attitude towards the work of the League. These comrades have a wrong argument that if the central work is not done well, they will make mistakes, which will affect their promotion; if the work of the League is not done well, it is just a shortcoming and subject to some criticism. Therefore, the conclusion is: it is better to have shortcomings than to make mistakes. This kind of thinking based on personal gains and losses often brings undue losses to the work of the League.
    Therefore, in order to give full play to the organizational role of the League, while improving the Party Committee's leadership over the work of the League, it is also necessary to require the League cadres to give full play to their initiative. In each period or in each major central work, they should take the initiative to report the League's work plan and the allocation of cadre forces to the Party Committee and ask the Party Committee to consider it and make overall arrangements. It is necessary to correct some of the incorrect understandings of some League cadres about the work of the League and their negative attitude towards the work of the League. A League cadre should not only do a good job in the central work, but also do a good job in the professional work of the League. They should be good at combining the professional work of the League with the central work of the Party and serve the central work by doing a good job in the professional work of the League.

    充分发挥青年团的组织作用
    路金栋
    （一）
    自从党中央发出“关于加强党对青年团的领导给各级党委的指示”以后，各级党委对青年团的领导在不断地加强；青年团的独立活动也比较普遍地开展了起来，因此，团的作用日益显著。但是，目前仍然有些县、区党委在领导青年团的工作和使用青年团的力量方面，采取着这样一种不正确的方法：只抓几个团的专职干部，不注意发动广大团员和群众；只要求团的干部作好中心工作，不过问他们的业务工作。例如，河北沧县团县委书记郭玉浦同志，1955年6月16日就担任了团县委书记，但到今年三月才开始作一部分团的工作。三月以前这九个月的时间里他在干什么呢？他担任了团县委书记的第二天，就被派到乡里去作中心工作，以后又参加了捕蝗工作。直到去年八月，他在报上看到团中央号召全国青少年在秋收中开展减少粮食棉花损耗运动的消息以后，回到县里请示党委应当如何响应这一号召。但党的县委书记却又派他去参加防汛工作。十月以后又被派到乡里作征兵工作，征兵工作还没有结束，又调他去作引河水浇地的准备工作。在这个时期里团县委召开了社会主义建设积极分子大会，团地工委召开了团县委书记会议，他都没有参加。团县委虽然还有两个副书记，可是也同样不能作团的工作。湖南湘乡县十九个团的专职干部，没有一个人专作团的业务工作。
    团员和青年是要求团的组织加强对他们的领导和开展团的独立活动的。他们向团的干部说：“村里死巴巴的，要唱歌没人教，要演戏没人领导，少先队员过队日没人辅导，该怎办呢？”多数团的干部也是有积极性的，但是他们找不到做工作的时间，只得对下级动员说：“钻空子，找窍门，抓紧时间开好团的干部会。”然而，青年的要求和团的干部的积极性，往往得不到领导上应有的支持，甚至有些团的干部因为积极开展团的独立活动，受到党委的批评，说他们有“单纯业务观点”。湖南零陵县的团县委有一次想开会传达团省委扩大会议的决议，先后向党委请示了四次，当时党委不但没有批准，反而批评了团县委的同志，并且要他们写书面检讨。
    凡是党委采取上述方法来领导青年团的工作和使用青年团的力量的地方，团的系统领导被打乱了，团的独立活动等于被取消了，团的组织陷入“半身不遂”的状态。这就大大削弱了团的组织作用。
    （二）
    目前，我们正在设法调动一切积极因素来为建设社会主义服务。青年的力量当然也在被调动之列，并且是“整个社会力量中一部分最积极最有生气的力量”。县、区两级团委直接领导着联系广大青年群众的基层组织；在团的干部中，县、区两级干部占多数，因此，改善县、区党委对青年团的领导，充分发挥团的基层组织的作用，对于提高团的工作，调动广大青年的积极性，是有重要意义的。
    目前，改善县、区党委对青年团的领导的中心环节是转变认识，改进领导方法。
    青年团干部的作用，是在党的领导下，通过团的组织去联系和教育广大青年群众，并且动员和带领他们为实现党的任务而斗争。只抓几个团的专职干部，不注意推动团的整个组织，这就影响了团与青年群众的联系，削弱了团的组织作用，也就降低了团的干部的作用。当然，为了完成某一项重要的任务，抽调一些团的干部并不是不可以的；但是党委在作这样的决定的时候，要考虑到确实有这种需要。在通常的情况下，无论如何，不应当把团的干部全部分配去作中心工作，更不应该让团的干部放下自己的业务工作去作其他部门的业务工作。
    要求团的干部作好中心工作，这是没有错的。但是，如果把团的业务工作和中心工作对立起来，不适当地指责要求开展团的业务工作的干部是“单纯业务观点”，却是不对的。在党委的统一领导下，团的系统领导的加强和业务工作的开展，不但不会影响中心工作，相反地，因为能够照顾青年的特点，适当地满足他们的要求，就可以更大地发挥团员和青年的积极性，更好地完成党的各项中心工作任务。
    根据已有的经验，党委领导青年团作好中心工作的基本方法应当是经常注意在方针、政策方面，及时地给团委以指示。在一定的时期里或一件大的中心工作中，向团的组织提出一定的任务和要求，给团的干部以进行业务工作的足够的时间，并且指导他们很好地安排自己的工作，帮助他们解决工作中的重要问题，给他们以必要的鼓励和支持，从而使他们通过团的组织，把全体团员和广大青年都发动起来，去完成这些任务。在这方面，今年四月十八日中国青年报刊登的河北蠡县党委改进对青年团的领导的经验，是可以供参考的。这个县里的党委，过去在领导青年团的工作方面是有严重的缺点的，只强调党的统一领导，忽视青年的特点，因而团的工作作的是不够好的。但是，在去年五月，他们学习了党中央关于加强党对青年团的领导的指示，改善了领导方法。从此以后，团的干部劲头大了，团的工作活跃起来了。团县委去年领导青年完成了玉米人工授粉六万六千多亩，超过党分配的任务总数的一倍；今年春天，又领导青年挖井四千五百多眼，占全县挖井总数的75％。
    领导青年团的干部在作好中心工作的同时作好团的业务工作，这也是党委的责任。党委应当经常关怀青年团的干部的进步，帮助他们提高思想水平和业务能力，健全和巩固团的系统领导。对于长期不作或者不安心作团的业务工作的干部，应当给以批评和教育。在吸收团的干部参加或列席党的会议，阅读党的文件和指示等方面，应当把青年团看成是一个独立的工作部门和系统，从工作需要出发，适当地加以照顾，以便使他们能够及时地了解党委的意图，正确地部署团的工作。如果团的干部向党委提出了不合理的要求，党委有责任对他们进行解释和教育，并且要注意珍视他们的积极性。
    （三）
    改善党委对青年团的领导，对于充分发挥团的组织作用虽然具有决定的意义，但是它不是唯一的条件。不少地方的团的业务工作开展不起来，是和团委领导上的缺点分不开的。有些团的干部，不主动计划和安排团的工作，党委让干什么，就去干什么，提不出问题和意见，或者是有意见没有勇气提出来。也有一些团的干部缺乏实事求是的态度，强要作自己力所不及的事情。例如青年团辽宁省建平县委与党委订了三个乡的包产合同，为了实现合同的要求，团县委的正、副书记和组织、宣传部长都到这三个乡里去了。这种作法显然是错误的，既然放弃了对全县团的工作的领导，自然就不可能使团的组织在整个中心工作中发挥应有的作用。甚至还有少数团的干部，他们对中心工作不辞劳苦（这当然是没有错的），而对团的工作采取应付的态度。这些同志有一种错误的论调，认为中心工作作不好，要犯错误，会影响对自己的提拔；团的工作作不好，顶大算个缺点，受点批评而已。因此，结论是：宁肯有缺点，不去犯错误。这种从个人得失出发的思想，往往给团的工作带来不应有的损失。
    因此，要想充分发挥团的组织作用，与改善党委对团的工作的领导的同时，还必须要求团的干部发挥最大的主动性。在每一个时期或者是每一件大的中心工作中，应当主动地把团的工作计划和干部力量的配置报告党委，请党委加以考虑，作通盘安排。要纠正一些团的干部对团的工作的一些不正确的认识和对团的工作的消极态度。一个团的干部，应当是既要作好中心工作，又要作好团的业务工作，要善于把团的业务工作和党的中心工作很好结合起来，通过作好团的业务工作去为中心工作服务。
