Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Ding reports: The first "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" National Music Week, which opened on August 1st and closed on the 24th, held over ninety concerts, performing nearly seven hundred works.

    National and folk music programs accounted for a large proportion of all performances. The white-haired ancient musician Guan Pinghu played the long-lost ancient piece "Guangling San" on a seven-stringed zither passed down from the Tang Dynasty. Pipa players Wei Zhongle and Li Tingsong, and erhu player Jiang Fengzhi all performed famous ancient pieces. The young Zhao Songting and Zhao Yuzhai enriched the expressive power of the bamboo flute and zheng with their original performance techniques. A group of bold innovators presented their improved folk instruments—the drum pipa, thirteen-hole curved flute, twelve-tone sheng, sheng hu, gehu, etc.—to the audience.

    Dozens of large-scale vocal and instrumental pieces appeared at the Music Week, along with their performers—large choirs of nearly a hundred people and orchestras of sixty to seventy people. Large choral works included "Song of Changbai," "Ode to the Motherland," "Long March Chorus," "Huai River Chorus," "Red Army Base Chorus," and "Happy Farm"; orchestral pieces included "Song of the Forest," "Spring Festival Suite," "The Story of the Yellow Crane," "Pixiu Dance," and "The Story of the Rose."

    Songs with a strong folk flavor and brimming with the breath of life were also outstanding programs at the Music Week. Some praised peace and the motherland, some eulogized historical or contemporary people's heroes, some sang of labor, youth, and love, and some ridiculed backward thinking. "Jialing River Boatman's Song," "Forest Boatman's Song Medley," "Leek Song," "Cuidongcui," "Only Green Leaves Can Match Red Flowers," and the Yunnan Shua Shan Diao, among others, were all successful works.

    The Music Week also featured music from movies, plays, and dance dramas, as well as operas. The excellent children's opera "Little Painter" from the May Fourth era also participated in the performances. Its author, 66-year-old Li Jinhui, personally served as artistic director.

    The works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, pioneers of Chinese socialist realist music, as well as those of excellent musicians from the May Fourth era, Huang Zi, Xiao Youmei, Liu Tianhua, Zhang Shu, Ren Guang, Mai Xin, etc., remained highlights of the Music Week. In particular, some mass songs from the War of Resistance Against Japan were still deeply moving.

    Cantonese opera actress Hong Xiannv, Shanghai opera actress Ding Shi'e, Peking opera actor Lou Zhenkui, and a cappella performances by other local opera actors; Xu Lixian's storytelling singing (tanci), Li Yueqiu's Qingyin, Liang Xiaolou and Wei Xikui's drum songs, and performances by other folk art actors all demonstrated the unique aspects of traditional folk singing methods.

    The Shandong Qinshu performed by young folk art actors Zou Huansheng and Han Fenglan allowed people to appreciate the new look of folk art after processing and improvement.

    The works and performances of more than two hundred singers, musicians, and musicologists, including those from over ten ethnic minorities, added brilliant colors to the Music Week. Korean composer Zheng Zhenyu, singer Fang Chushan; Mongolian storytelling poet Mao Yihan, singers Hazabu and Bao Yindelege, and veteran artist Serexi; Uyghur female singer Ayimunisa, Miao female singer Apao, and several singers who came from the Tibetan Plateau all received high praise.

    Young musicians also performed works created by composers for children.

    Many excellent works by famous musicians He Luting, Ma Sicong, Ding Shande, and others were selected by delegations from various regions as programs for the Music Week, and Ma Sicong and Ding Shande also performed violin and piano solos.

    Vocalists Ying Shangneng and Huang Youkui, who had not performed on stage for nearly twenty years, enthusiastically performed solos. The performances of famous singers Yu Yixuan, Zhou Xiaoyan, Lang Yuxiu, Li Zhishu, and Wen Kezheng all showed new achievements in singing style and performance skills. Jiang Ying, the wife of scientist Qian Xuesen, who returned from the United States last year, also met the audience of the motherland for the first time at a concert during the Music Week.

    Twenty-two-year-old pianist Fu Cong already enjoys international fame. Liu Shiren, the composer of "Ode to the Motherland," and Shi Yongkang, the author of "The Story of the Yellow Crane," are both graduates of the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music in 1954. Young singers Guo Lanying, Huang Hong, Dong Ailin, Jiao Yunyu, Zhang Yuenan, Fan Yulun, Li Shujun, Du Lihua, Ju Xiufang, and others have all been loved by audiences. Soprano Zheng Xingli, who had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union, and mezzo-soprano Luo Tianchan, who only recently began performing solos, have both attracted people's attention.

    The Music Week brought together the main forces of the national music community and was a gathering of musical heroes.

    全国音乐周上群英会演
    百花齐放演出近七百个作品
    据新华社26日讯　新华社记者沈鼎报道“百花齐放”的第一届全国音乐周从8月1日开幕，到24日闭幕，共举行了九十多个音乐会、演出近七百个作品。
    民族、民间的音乐节目占了全部演出节目的很大比重。白发苍苍的古乐家管平湖在一张唐代流传下来的七弦琴上弹奏了绝响已久的古曲“广陵散”。琵琶演奏家卫仲乐、李廷松和二胡演奏家蒋风之都演奏了著名的古曲。年轻的赵松庭和赵玉斋以他们独创的演奏技法，丰富了竹笛和筝的表现力。一群大胆的革新者把他们改良的民间乐器——鼓琶、十三孔曲笛、十二平均律笙、笙胡、革胡等和听众见了面。
    在音乐周上出现了几十个大型声乐曲和器乐曲，以及它们的表演者——近百人的大合唱队和六、七十人的管弦乐队。“长白之歌”、“祖国颂”、“长征大合唱”、“淮河大合唱”、“红军根据地大合唱”、“幸福的农庄”等大合唱；“山林之歌”、“春节组曲”、“黄鹤的故事”、“貔貅舞曲”、“玫瑰花的故事”等管弦乐曲。
    带着浓厚的民间风味和生活气息的歌曲也是参加音乐周演出的出色节目。有的歌颂和平、歌颂祖国，有的颂扬历史上的或者当代的人民英雄，有的歌唱劳动、歌唱青春和爱情，有的嘲笑落后思想。“嘉陵江号子”、“森林号子联唱”、“韭菜歌”、“嗺咚嗺”、“绿叶才能配红花”和云南的耍山调等等都是其中的成功之作。
    音乐周中还演出了电影、话剧、舞剧的音乐，以及歌剧。“五四”以来优秀的儿童歌剧“小小画家”，也参加了演出。它的作者——六十六岁的黎锦晖亲自担任艺术指导。
    中国社会主义现实主义音乐的先驱者——聂耳和冼星海，以及“五四”以来的优秀的音乐家黄自、萧友梅、刘天华、张曙、任光、麦新等人的作品，仍然是音乐周中的精彩节目。特别是一些抗日救亡运动中的群众歌曲，依然动人心魄。
    粤剧演员红线女、沪剧演员丁是娥、京剧演员娄振奎和其他地方戏曲演员的清唱；徐丽仙的弹词，李月秋的清音，良小楼、魏喜奎的大鼓和其他曲艺演员的表演，都显示了民间传统演唱方法的独到之处。
    青年曲艺演员邹环生和韩凤兰演唱的山东琴书，让人们欣赏了经过加工、提高的曲艺的新面貌。
    包括十多个兄弟民族的二百多个歌手、乐师和音乐家的作品和表演，给音乐周增添了绚烂的色彩。朝鲜族作曲家郑镇玉，歌唱家方初善；蒙古族说唱诗人毛依罕，歌唱家哈扎布、宝音德勒格，老艺人色拉西；维吾尔族女歌唱家阿依木尼萨、苗族女歌手阿泡和远从西藏高原赶来的几位歌手等都获得了很高评价。
    少年音乐家们也演出作曲家们为少年儿童们创作的作品。
    著名音乐家贺绿汀、马思聪、丁善德等人的不少优秀作品，都被各地代表团选为参加音乐周演出的节目，马思聪和丁善德还表演了小提琴独奏和钢琴独奏。
    近二十年没有登台表演的声乐家应尚能和黄友葵都热情地表演了独唱。著名歌唱家喻宜萱、周小燕、郎毓秀、李志曙、温可铮的表演，无论在演唱风格和表现技巧上都有新的成就。去年从美国回国的科学家钱学森夫人、歌唱家蒋英也在音乐周的一次音乐会上首次和祖国听众会面。
    年仅二十二岁的钢琴演奏家傅聪，已经享有国际声誉。“祖国颂”的作曲者刘施任和“黄鹤的故事”的作者施咏康都是中央音乐学院华东分院1954年毕业的学生。青年歌唱家郭兰英、黄虹、董爱琳、教蕴瑜、张越男、范裕纶、李淑君、杜丽华、鞠秀芳等人都已经受到了听众爱戴。刚从苏联留学归国的女高音郑兴丽和在最近才开始表演独唱的女中音罗天婵都引起了人们的重视。
    音乐周集中了全国音乐界的主要力量，是音乐界的一次群英会。
