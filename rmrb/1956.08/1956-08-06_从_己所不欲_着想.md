Thinking from "What You Do Not Wish Upon Yourself"
    Bǐng Chéng

A person who writes articles must also be a person who reads articles. One may be able to read before being able to write, and later be able to both read and write, and even when one can write, one still reads other people's articles.

If a writer can reflect on himself and think about what kind of articles he doesn't like, it would be somewhat helpful in improving writing style.

For example, when reading other people's articles, one sometimes thinks: This piece is well-rounded and steady, all the points are expected and relevant, of course it forms a chapter, but it seems like I've seen it somewhere before, and more than once, just with slightly different wording. From this, one can understand a simple principle: an article, whether large or small, profound or shallow, must contain something new and worthwhile to tell people, and it must be one's own. If it's not something new and worthwhile to tell people, why waste ink? If it's not one's own, why waste one's own ink?

For example, when reading other people's articles, one sometimes feels that they are "verbose," or too bloated, or too rambling. If those bloated or rambling parts were removed, the length could be shortened, but the substance would remain the same. From this thought, one can deduce that the formula "can × can not ×, do not ×" also applies to writing articles. Words that can be said or not said should not be said. Not being afraid of saying too much, and saying things that don't need to be said, is endless. Trying to say as many things as possible that don't need to be said, wasting one's own ink is a minor matter; what's serious is wasting the reader's energy and time. Pointlessly wasting other people's energy and time is almost a moral issue, wouldn't you say it's serious?

For example, when reading other people's articles, one sometimes really wants to find the author and ask him a series of questions. "Your article seems to mean this, and also seems to mean that, but what exactly do you mean? Why don't you use certain words in their customary usage? What exactly do you want to express by using these words? Why are some of your sentences not in accordance with our grammatical conventions? Are you trying to create some unique grammatical rules by doing this?" Thinking about these questions, it's easy to remember that the purpose of writing articles is for people to read, and clarity comes first. Word choice and sentence construction should pay attention to the social nature of language. It's not that innovation is not allowed, but innovation should be based on customary usage. Otherwise, if you "create" some "personal" language, readers will return a large pile of "whys" to you.

The preceding remarks begin with "for example," which of course means giving examples and not intending to be comprehensive. However, if just the few points mentioned above could be put into practice by some people, the writing style, even if it doesn't undergo a complete "transformation," would be considerably improved.

    从“己所不欲”着想
    秉丞
    写文章的人必然是读文章的人。在先能读未必能写，后来能读又能写，能写的时候还是读人家的文章。
    要是写文章的人能够反求诸己，想一想自己不满意怎么样的文章，对于改进文风多少会有点儿办法。
    譬如读人家的文章，有时候这么想：这篇东西四平八稳，全都是题中应有之义文，当然成一篇章，可是好像在什么地方见过，而且见过不止一回，不过字句有些儿不同罢了。从这上头就可以悟出一个简单的道理，文章无论大小深浅，总得是值得告诉人家的新鲜东西，还得是自己的东西。要不是值得告诉人家的新鲜东西，为什么要浪费笔墨呢？要不是自己的东西，为什么要费自己的笔墨呢？
    譬如读人家的文章，有时候觉得未免“辞费”，或者太臃肿了，或者太支蔓了，如果去掉那些臃肿或是支蔓的部分，篇幅可以缩短，实质还是一样。从这个想头推开来，就知道“可×可不×，不×”的公式也适用于写文章，可说可不说的话应该不说。不怕多说，可以不说的话也要说，那是没有底的。尽量说些可以不说的话，浪费自己的笔墨还是小事，严重的是耗损读者的精力和时间。无缘无故耗损人家的精力和时间，那几乎是道德问题了，你说严重不严重？
    譬如读人家的文章，有时候很想找到文章的作者，问他一连串的话。“你这篇文章仿佛是这么个意思，又仿佛是那么个意思，你的意思到底怎么样呢？你所用的某些个词为什么不照约定俗成的用法呢？你用这些个词到底想表达什么意思呢？你的某些语句为什么不合咱们的语法习惯呢？你这样做，是不是想独创一些语法规律呢？……”想起这些问话，就很容易想起写文章为的是给人家看，明确第一。遣词造句要注意语言的社会性，并非不容许独创，可是要在约定俗成的基础上独创。否则“创”出些“个人”的语言来，读者就会回敬你一大堆的“为什么”。
    前边的话用“譬如”开头，当然是举例的意思，不准备说周全。然而，就是前边提到的几点，假如有这么些人能够实践，文风即使不怎么“丕变”，也改进得很可观了。
