A Night of Battle
Xinhua News Agency reporters in Harbin (Collective Writing)

When the historically unprecedented flood threatened the city of Harbin, the people of the city fought against the flood day and night. The day was busy and tense, and the night was a sleepless night of battle. After more than ten days of flood prevention efforts, the night in Harbin is still brightly lit everywhere, and the people engaged in flood prevention are working tirelessly to increase the height and strengthen the dam projects. On the river embankments, in dangerous construction sites, and in soil extraction fields, people are racing against the flood, exchanging time, and overcoming the flood.

Here are some excerpts from what reporters saw at the flood prevention construction sites at night.

On Dangerous Sections of the Embankment

On the night of the 14th, reporters visited several dangerous sections of the embankment. On the East Embankment, one of the city's main dangerous embankments, the critical situation that reporters saw a few days ago has been reversed. After several days and nights of tenacious resistance by thousands of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, although the water level is now much higher than it was then, the speed at which the river embankment is increasing in height is faster than the rise in water level. Looking along the lights along the river, you can see that this section of the embankment has been raised by one meter compared to the original, and the embankment body has also been thickened. The flood prevention commanders who came to inspect all praised the PLA officers and soldiers for their high efficiency and good quality in reinforcing the embankments. At another dangerous section, the "Three No's" construction site, when reporters first came here, the water and the embankment were competing in length, and it seemed that the water was in danger of exceeding the embankment. Now the embankment is nearly two meters higher than the water surface. The changes in these dangerous sections of the embankment show that the flood prevention army has achieved great victories in the past ten days and nights of battle.

But people did not go to sleep because of the victory. On this night with a gentle breeze and stable waves, there were still tens of thousands of people on guard on the embankment. The embankment patrol members, with copper gongs hanging from their waists, vigilantly patrolled back and forth on the embankment, using the rows of lights. The sound of the patrol boat's motor occasionally broke the silence on the river surface. The loudspeakers on each embankment section continuously reported the new achievements of each combat unit. A section of the 80-meter-long embankment body at the mouth of the Majiagou River, a tributary of the Songhua River, collapsed the day before. After a day and night of intense rescue by hundreds of workers, citizens, and PLA soldiers, the collapse has been stopped, but in order to make this section of the embankment more solid, people are still running hundreds of feet away to transport soil to expand the embankment foot. A large embankment protecting the railway suddenly developed cracks. The front-line commander immediately grabbed the telephone next to the embankment and reported this emergency to the headquarters. Several tens of minutes later, the person in charge of the headquarters and rescue experts arrived, conducted on-site research, and immediately launched a rescue operation. Bags filled with soil were lined up on the dangerous embankment, and rescue tools were placed next to them for emergency needs.

Midnight arrived, and the shift change began. The clerks of the temporary supply station carried baskets full of food and drinks such as bread, sausages, and soda to meet people's needs. Medics with Red Cross backpacks carefully inquired whether there were any injured or sick people in each resting group. The female citizens, who were not allowed on the embankment at night, quietly sent boiling water along the embankment. A large truck pulled a steaming food cart to the construction site. A midnight feast completely dispelled people's fatigue and sleepiness, and they continued to fight energetically until dawn.

On the Guxiang Embankment

On the evening of the 14th, the people on the 3.6-kilometer-long Guxiang Embankment experienced more than ten nights of intense battle, rescued the key projects, and now entered the second line of defense to increase the height and strengthen the soil embankment.

3:00 AM on the 14th was an unforgettable moment of hardship. The black waves on the Songhua River, taking advantage of the strong winds, tumbled over the wave-breaking wooden rafts and impacted the embankment. The waves collapsed the embankment-protecting stones, and seven dangerous situations had already appeared on the Guxiang Embankment, and several hidden dangers had already seeped into the water. Watching the situation was very urgent. People cannot forget that during the great flood of 1932, a breach occurred on this embankment, and the river flooded the main urban area of Harbin, and the people suffered unprecedented disasters... The rescuers said: We must not let the old disasters repeat themselves. Therefore, when the construction site broadcasting station broadcast: Now the wind and waves are very strong, embankment protection and flood prevention comrades pay attention to rescue work, dozens of rescue workers and PLA soldiers jumped into the turbulent river without hesitation, they faced the icy waves, groped in the dark, and plugged the loopholes on the embankment. Unable to stand firm in the water, each person tied a rope around their waist, and the people on the embankment pulled them. After two hours of hard struggle, the loopholes were finally blocked, and the dangerous situation was rescued.

In the second section of the Guxiang Embankment, the river water was already two or three meters higher than the ground, and the embankment was a swampy area, and the river water seeped out through the embankment. It was very difficult to extract soil here, and the project was extremely dangerous. The more than 340-member heroic rescue team of the local state-owned Harbin Lumber Mill arrived here. They passed through a floating bridge dozens of meters long to extract soil from the depression. The floating bridge swayed and could not withstand the pressure. City model worker and worker Dang Guosheng jumped into the waist-deep mud to tie the floating bridge, time and time again, to ensure the passage of the floating bridge. In the evening, the 54 advanced producers of this factory who participated in flood prevention and the entire rescue team together completed the day's embankment reinforcement project ahead of schedule, and the seepage was brought under control.

Reporters walked down the more than seven-kilometer-long Guxiang and Daoli embankments. The embankments were brightly lit everywhere, and the second line of defense was built to be wide and straight. Wooden barriers had been installed on the Daoli embankment, and the newly built railway had been extended more than 50 meters towards the river bank, shortening the distance for transporting soil. The tense ramming and carrying of soil by the flood prevention people merged into one. On the opposite bank of the vast river, the lights of Sun Island, a scenic area, shone brightly, like a sleepless town standing in the night sky.

At the Sankongqiao Soil Extraction Site

When the flood prevention people were standing on the front line of the embankment and carrying out intense rescue, reinforcement, and heightening projects, the people at the Sankongqiao, Power Plant, and Pingfang soil extraction sites, which supplied these projects with soil, were also working day and night with extraordinary intensity.

At night, reporters came to the largest of these three soil extraction sites—the Sankongqiao construction site—for interviews. By the evening of the 14th, the dozens of miles of embankments in Harbin had swallowed more than 140,000 cubic meters of earth from this site. After walking through a dark and rugged path, what appeared before us was a magnificent labor night scene. More than a dozen 500- to 1,000-degree spotlights and hundreds of electric lights illuminated the three sections of the construction site as if it were daytime. More than a dozen lines of the Harbin Railway Station marshalling yard ran across the middle of these three sections, and the lighting equipment on this section of the line further increased the brightness of the soil extraction site. More than ten bonfires were lit in each section. Seven or eight broadcasting stations reported the labor achievements of each section and the young people's determination to defend Harbin from time to time.

On this night, the people participating in soil extraction were cadres from six universities and colleges in Harbin, as well as the Harbin Institute of Civil Engineering Science, the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture, the Bureau of Commerce, the Bureau of Taxation, and other eleven units, as well as the Heilongjiang Provincial and Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Communist Youth League. There were more than 3,000 people here, including university presidents, teachers, scientific researchers, doctors, nurses, actors, vice-chairmen of the provincial and municipal trade unions, and even cooks. They had been undertaking the night shift soil loading task at this site for seven or eight nights. Here, densely packed crowds filled bags and baskets with moist soil and shuttled back and forth to the ninety railcars parked on the railway.

At the third construction site, reporters saw three vice-chairmen of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions carrying soil and digging soil like young men. At this construction site, they also ran into Wang Jun, vice-chairman of the Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, who also participated in digging and carrying soil. Wang Jun's twelve-year-old son also followed his mother to participate in the labor. He was the only youngest person on this construction site, but he took a shovel like an adult and dug soil one shovel at a time, without any fatigue. This night was the fourth night he had followed his mother to participate in the labor.

At midnight, when the second set of forty-five vehicles was about to arrive at the third construction site, more than 60 young people from the Harbin Institute of Civil Engineering Science studied the preparations for this loading and decided to challenge the nearby Harbin Medical University. They proposed to complete the soil loading task in 70 minutes and ensure quality and no accidents. After the news was broadcast on the broadcaster, more than 200 people from Harbin Medical University did not show weakness either. They proposed to complete the same tonnage of freight car loading task in 60 minutes. When the second loading work began, the two units launched a heated competition. Harbin Medical University fulfilled its challenge conditions.

It was already past 12:00 midnight when we came out of the third construction site. Reporters strolled to a small house next to the railway. A staff member of the railway vehicle dispatch team told me that all the construction sites had completed tonight's loading task one and a half to two hours earlier tonight. This was already the sixth or seventh night that the loading task had been completed early. (Attached Picture)

    战斗的夜晚
    新华社驻哈尔滨记者集体采写
    当历史上空前未有的洪水威胁哈尔滨市的时候，全市人民夜以继日地和洪水作斗争。白天，是繁忙紧张的白天，夜晚，是战斗的不眠的夜晚。经过十多天的防汛战斗后，夜在哈尔滨仍然是到处电灯通明，防汛的人们不懈地为加高加固堤坝工程而紧张劳动。在江堤上，在险要工地里，在取土场上，人们正在和洪水竞赛，换取时间，战胜洪水。
    这里记录的是记者们夜间在防汛工地上看到的片断。
    在险要的堤段上
    十四日的夜里，记者巡访了几个险要堤段。在全市主要险堤之一的东大堤上，记者几天前看到的危急局面已经有了扭转，经过数千人民解放军官兵几个昼夜的顽强抗争，虽然现在的水位比那时又上涨了很多，但江堤增高的速度比水位上涨来得快，顺着沿江的电灯光看去，可以看到这段堤坝比原来加高了一公尺，堤身也加厚了。前来巡视的防汛指挥员们，都称赞解放军官兵在加固堤坝中效率高，质量好。在另一个险堤段“三不管”工地上，记者第一次来这儿的时候，水和堤争长，眼看水有超过堤坝的危险，现在堤坝已高出水面近两公尺。这些险堤段的变化情形显示防汛大军在过去十多个昼夜的战斗中，已经取得了很大的胜利。
    但人们并没有因胜利而去睡觉，在这个微风浪稳的夜里，仍有成千成万的人严阵以待地守卫在堤坝上。腰间挂着铜锣的护堤队员，借着成排的灯光，警觉地在堤上来回巡视着。巡查艇的马达声，不时划破江面上的沉静。各堤段的广播喇叭，连连地报道各战斗单位的新战果。松花江支流马家沟河口有一段八十公尺长的堤身，前一天发生了坍塌的险象。经过几百名职工、市民和人民解放军官兵一昼夜的紧张抢救，坍塌现象已被制止了，但为了使这段堤坝更加牢固，人们还在从好几百尺以外跑步运来泥土，扩大堤脚。防护铁路的一道大堤，突然发生了裂纹，前线指挥员马上抓起堤旁的电话机，把这个紧急情况向指挥部做了报告，几十分钟以后指挥部的负责人和抢险专家赶到了，就地经过研究，立刻展开了抢救行动，险堤上排列着一袋袋装满泥土的草袋，旁边放着抢险工具，以备抢险急需。
    午夜到了，轮班人员的休息开始了，临时供应站的营业员们，背着满装面包、香肠、汽水等食品和饮料的筐子供应人们的需要。肩上挂着红十字背包的卫生员，细心地查问每个休息的人群中有没有受伤和生病的人。晚间不被允许上堤的市民妇女，悄悄地顺着堤送来了开水。一辆大卡车拖带着热气腾腾的饭车驰向了工地。一顿午夜的饱餐，完全赶走了人们的疲劳和睡意，一直精力充沛地战斗到黎明。
    在顾乡大堤上
    十四日晚，三点六公里长的顾乡大堤上防汛的人们经历了十多个夜晚的紧张战斗后，抢救住险要工程，现在进入了第二道防线，进行土堤的加高加固。
    十四日晨三时是艰险难忘的时刻。松花江上的黑浪借着大风，翻腾越过防浪木排冲击着堤岸，波浪冲塌了护堤的石块，顾乡大堤已经出现了七处险情，几处隐患已经渗进了水。眼看着形势非常紧急。人们不能忘怀，远在1932年大水灾的日子里，就在这条堤上决了口，江水漫了哈尔滨主要市区，人民遭受着空前的灾难……抢险的人们说：不能让旧难重演。因此，当工地广播站播出：现在风浪很大，护堤、防汛同志们注意抢险的号召后，几十个抢险队员和人民解放军战士毫不犹豫地跳进水浪滔滔的江中，他们迎着冰凉的浪花，黑地里摸着和塞堵堤岸上的漏洞。水中站不稳，每个人腰间拴上一根绳，堤上的人拉着他们。这样苦斗了两小时，终于堵塞了漏洞，抢救了险情。
    在顾乡大堤第二工段里，江水已高出地二、三公尺，堤岸下是一片沼泽地区，江水透过堤岸渗出来。这里取土十分困难，而工程又极险要。地方国营哈尔滨制材厂的三百四十多人的英勇抢险队到了这里。他们通过几十公尺长的浮桥到洼地取土，浮桥摆动，经不起压力，市劳动模范、工人党国胜就跳进水深及腰的泥沼里扎绑浮桥，一次又一次，保证了浮桥通行。夜晚，这个厂参加防汛的五十四名先进生产者和全体抢险队一起已超计划完成了全天堤防加固工程，渗水被控制住了。
    记者沿着七公里多长的顾乡、道里堤岸而下，堤岸上到处灯光明亮，二道堤防都修到宽敞平直，道里堤岸上已安上木板障，新修的铁道已向江岸上延长五十多公尺，运土的距离缩短了。防汛的人们紧张的打夯声和担土声混成一片。在浩荡的江的对岸，风景区太阳岛灯光辉映，像不眠的市镇屹立在夜空中。
    在三孔桥采土场
    当防汛的人们站在堤防前线进行紧张的抢险、加固、加高工程的时候，源源供应这些工程用土的三孔桥、发电厂、平坊三个采土场工地的人们，也正在日日夜夜异常紧张地劳动着。
    入夜，记者来到这三个采土场中最大的一个工地——三孔桥工地采访。到十四日晚上，哈尔滨几十里堤坝已经吞去了这个工地十四万多立方公尺土方。走过了一段黑漆漆崎岖的小路后，眼前呈现的是一幅雄伟的劳动夜景。十几盏五百度到一千度聚光灯和几百盏电灯把工地的三个工段照耀得如同白昼。哈尔滨车站调车场十几条线路横贯在这三个工段中间，这段线路的照明设备，越发增加了采土场上的光度。各个工段燃起了十多堆篝火。七、八个广播站此起彼落地不时播送各个工段的劳动成绩和年青人保卫哈尔滨的决心书。
    这天晚上，参加采土的人们，是哈尔滨六个大学院、校和哈尔滨土木科学研究所、哈尔滨市文化局、商业局、税务局等十一个单位和黑龙江省、市工会、市青年团的干部。这里有大学校长、教师、科学研究人员、医生、护士、演员、省、市工会副主席以至炊事员等共三千多人。他们担当这个工地的夜班装土任务已经有七、八个晚上了。在这里密密麻麻的人群，装满了一袋袋、一筐筐湿润的泥土，穿梭般送往停放在铁路上的九十节车辆上。
    在第三工地上，记者看见黑龙江省工会联合会三位副主席和小伙子一样扛土、挖土。在这个工地上，还碰到了哈尔滨市工会联合会副主席王军，她也参加挖土、扛土。王军的十二岁的儿子也跟着妈妈参加劳动，他是这个工地里唯一年纪最小的人，可是他和大人一样拿着铁锹，一锹一锹的挖土，毫无倦容。这天晚上，是他跟着妈妈参加劳动的第四个晚上了。
    深夜十二点钟的时候，当第二次四十五节车辆快要到第三工地的时候，哈尔滨土木科学研究所六十多个年青人研究了这次装车准备工作后，决定向邻近的哈尔滨医科大学挑战，他们提出要在七十分钟内完成装土任务，并且保证质量和不出事故。这个消息在广播器传出后，哈尔滨医科大学二百多人也不示弱，他们提出要用六十分钟完成同样吨位车皮装车任务。当第二次装车工作开始的时候，这两个单位展开了热烈的竞赛。哈尔滨医科大学实现了自己的应战条件。
    从第三工地出来，已经是午夜十二时多了，记者踱到铁路旁小屋，铁路车辆调度组一位工作人员告诉我，这天晚上各个工地都提早一点半到两点钟完成今晚装车任务。这已经是第六、七个晚上早完成装车任务了。（附图片）
