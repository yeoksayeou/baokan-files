    The Great Cause of the Great People
    Soviet Writer Sabit Mukanov
    We three Soviet writers—Vadim Sobko, Vera Ketlinskaya, and I—traveled in central and southeastern China for about a month. Now that we have toured this great country, we are going to even more distant places—my comrades to the north, and I to the northwest, to Xinjiang.

    When I crossed the threshold of fraternal China, I decided to firmly record everything I would see on this great land. From the first day I arrived in the People's Republic of China, I kept a daily diary without interruption, and in twenty-six days, I filled two three-hundred-page pocket diaries.

    As I left China's capital, Beijing, for Xinjiang, I fell into contemplation: "What have I seen in China during the past days?" I opened my diary, every page of which looked at me with enthusiastic pleasure, because each page recorded the fraternal sincerity I encountered from my Chinese friends during the journey. All these friends I had direct contact with now appear vividly before my eyes, and as I write this article, I want to hug each of them tightly and kiss them warmly, just as I did when saying goodbye. I think I am happier than before, because now I understand China not from paper, not from journals and books, but through the vivid faces of my many friends, men and women of different ages. These people, whom I met and became good friends with in twenty-six days, I will always remember.

    We traveled from the Soviet Union to Beijing, and from there along the route: Beijing—Guangzhou—Wuhan—Shanghai—Beijing. In these cities, we visited many state and cultural institutions, toured historical monuments, admired the many amazing works of art created by the great Chinese people over thousands of years, visited factories and new construction sites, visited many agricultural production cooperatives, met with cooperative members and other individuals, listened to theater and concert performances, watched many films, and toured many scenic spots. All of these now vividly reappear before me.

    While leaving most of my writings about People's China for future completion, I still cannot help but mention the following two points in this short article: one is about the friendship between the two peoples, and the other is about the brilliant Chinese art, especially drama.

    Let's talk about friendship first. Initially, all I knew was that here, in People's China, people called us "Soviets." Whether we were traveling by car or on foot, whether in cities, villages, or anywhere else, I don't know how people recognized us as Soviets, but everywhere they greeted us with affectionate tones, looked at us with affectionate eyes, and shouted in unison: "Soviet... Soviet..." adding the words "Big Brother." Now, this friendly and intimate chorus that we heard everywhere in China is still pleasantly ringing in my ears, and it sounds very good.

    But this chorus is not only expressed in sound, but also echoes in deeds. I can cite many examples in this regard, but this article cannot accommodate them, so I will limit myself to one obvious fact here.

    On June 4th, we visited the construction project of the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan City. As everyone knows, Soviet experts also participated in this construction. I first went to engineer Silin Konstantin Sergeyevich. He had participated in the survey and design of the new bridge and is now also participating in the construction of the new bridge. This is a cheerful middle-aged man. After enthusiastically introducing us to the construction materials and work progress, he suggested that we talk to engineer Xiao Chuanren. At the same time, Silin also said that Xiao Chuanren is the pride of this construction project, because he is an active participant and backbone of the bridge's design and construction work.

    I thought this commendable Chinese comrade must be an old man. But I was wrong. Comrade Xiao Chuanren was only thirty-two years old, a handsome, articulate, and energetic young man. We learned a lot from talking with him: not only about the construction of the bridge, but also about the great river on earth—the Yangtze River (one-tenth of humanity lives on its banks)—and about its great construction prospects. From Comrade Xiao Chuanren's conversation, we learned that this great river has not only nurtured most of the Chinese people for thousands of years, but has also been the source of many natural disasters. Finally, it will be completely subdued by the steel arms of democratic China and obediently and faithfully serve the cause of a happy communist society.

    Xiao Chuanren is not only an expert and organizer of bridge work, but also a great thinker. His healthy and young, energetic mind is full of beautiful creative ideas, full of longing for the bright future of his great motherland and great people. Better yet, he, this talented young engineer, not only thinks, but also acts; not only acts, but also leads. He works well and is a good person. In his important position in the construction project, he is impeccable both in his work and in his dealings with people. His criticism of his colleagues is reasonable, humble, and polite, while also being pragmatic and demanding. All of this is good, but what is even more noteworthy is that when he talks about his work and his achievements, he attributes them all to Soviet engineer Kosigin Dmitry Grigorievich.

    "Because of being with Comrade Kosigin often, and because of his teachings and concrete help, I, this young engineer, learned how to lead large construction work," said Comrade Xiao Chuanren.

    "That's not the case," Comrade Kosigin, tall, quite old, with a full beard, humbly pointed out, "In fact, it's useless to teach a fool, but Comrade Xiao is very good because he is smart and capable."

    Hidden deep within these polite words are the roots of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, the roots of their mutual learning.

    When talking about the friendship between our two peoples, I cannot help but recall with excitement a little girl—Qin Qiquan. On the bank of the Yangtze River, she took off her Young Pioneer's red scarf and tied it around my neck. The gist of her words was: "I give this gift expressing my heart as a Young Pioneer to the Soviet Big Brother." The tone of these words was so touching that the emotions of us writers brought tears to my eyes. I couldn't find any other words to express my fatherly gratitude to her except to say "Thank you," and I couldn't think of any other words in those few minutes because I was so moved. I hugged her tightly with tears in my eyes, kissed her, and my heart was filled with joy, because I saw the bright future of a communist society on the face of this eleven-year-old Young Pioneer, and the unbreakable friendship of this society.

    Next, I would like to briefly talk about my impression of Chinese drama, especially the Han Opera I saw in Hankou.

    Let's talk about the Han Opera "Ahei and Ashima." It should be said that, in my opinion, there are many fantastical, non-realistic elements in Chinese drama, especially in Peking Opera. The value of "Ahei and Ashima" lies in the fact that, in this play, the realistic theme overwhelms the fantastical elements, and the plot does not have a special exaggeration of reality; it expresses the real life of ordinary working people, their pain and happiness, worries and expectations.

    The male lead, the shepherd Ahei, is played by Li Luoke, an experienced and superbly skilled genius actor, and the female lead, Ashima, is played by the young actress Hua Bilan. Her performance is full of convincing dramatic effect. She sings well and dances well. If she doesn't become arrogant and complacent in the future and continues to move forward, then without a doubt, she will gain even greater honor on the stage.

    Later, I talked to the staff of the theater troupe about my views on the play "Ahei and Ashima." In general, I feel that this troupe is advancing on the right path, delving deeper and deeper into realism.

    I don't know yet how to use the materials I obtained during my visit to China, but I can believe that I will use these materials to write something, because in my opinion, they are all interesting, and therefore, although very inadequate, they can still show the outstanding things that have appeared in socialist China from a certain perspective. I will write them, use various styles to write them, and write them most sincerely.

    伟大人民的伟大事业
    苏联作家  萨比特·穆卡诺夫
    我们三个苏联作家——瓦吉姆·索布柯、薇拉·凯特玲斯卡娅和我，在中国的中部和东南部旅行了大约一个月光景。当我们在这个伟大的国度已经游历了一遭以后，我们又要到更远的地方去——我的同志们到北方，而我则到西北，到新疆。
    我在跨进兄弟般的中国的门槛以后，就决定把我在这伟大土地上将要看到的一切牢牢地记下来。从到中华人民共和国的第一天起，我就逐日不间断地记日记，在二十六天当中，我已经把两本三百页的袖珍日记写满了。
    而当我离开中国的首都北京到新疆去的时候，我陷入了沉思：“在逝去的那些日子里，我在中国看到了一些什么呢？”我打开自己的日记本，它的每一页都用热情的眼光惬意地望着我，因为每页日记都铭记着我在旅途中从中国朋友那里接触到的那种兄弟般的诚挚的感情。所有我直接接触过的这些朋友，现在都栩栩如生地出现在我的眼前，而我，现在在写这篇文章的当儿，就像向他们每个人告别时候那样，真想一个个紧紧地拥抱他们，热烈地吻他们。我认为自己比以前更加幸福，因为我现在不是从纸上，不是从期刊和书本上，而是通过我的许多朋友，不同年龄的男人和女人的生动面貌，来了解中国。这些人，我在二十六天当中同他们结识并且成了好朋友，我将永远记着他们。
    我们从苏联到北京，并从这里沿着这样的路线旅行：北京——广州——武汉——上海——北京。在这些城市里，我们访问了许多国家机关和文化机关，参观了历史纪念物，欣赏了伟大中国人民几千年来创造的许多令人惊叹的艺术品，到过工厂、新建筑工地，访问了许多农业生产合作社，会见了合作社的社员和其他个别的人，听了剧院和音乐会的演出，看了许多影片，游览了许多名胜。所有这些，现在都活生生地再现在我的面前。
    在把自己关于人民中国的著述的大部分留待未来完成的时候，对于下面两个问题，我在这篇短文里仍然不能不说一说：一是关于两国人民的友谊，一是关于灿烂的中国艺术，特别是戏剧。
    先谈谈友谊。当初我只知道，在这里，在人民中国，人们都喊我们是“苏联人”。不管是我们乘车或步行，不管是在城市、乡村或其他任何地方，我不知道人们怎么会认出我们是苏联人，而且到处都是用亲热的声调招呼我们，用亲热的目光看我们，并且齐声喊道：“苏联……苏联……”，还加上几个字：“老大哥”。现在，我们在中国处处听到的这种友好而亲切的合唱，还在我的耳际愉快地响着，而且很好听。
    但是这种合唱不仅用声音来表现，而且回响在事业中。我可以举出这方面的许多事例，可是这篇文章无法容纳它们，因此我在这里只限于讲一件明显的事实。
    六月四日，我们在武汉市参观了长江大桥的建筑工程。大家都知道，苏联专家也参加了这项建设。我先到工程师西林·康士坦丁·谢尔盖耶维奇那里。他曾参加新桥的勘查设计工作，现在也参加了新桥的建筑。这是一个愉快的中年人。他向我们热心地介绍了建筑材料和工作进程以后，建议我们去跟萧传仁工程师谈谈。同时西林还说，萧传仁是这个建筑工程引以自豪的人，因为他是大桥设计工作和建筑工作的积极参加者和骨干。
    我想这位值得称赞的中国同志一定是个上了岁数的人。可是我猜错了，原来萧传仁同志只有三十二岁，是个端正、漂亮、健谈的年轻人。我们在同他谈话中了解到很多东西：不仅有关于大桥建设方面的，还有关于地球上一条伟大河流——长江（全人类十分之一的人住在它的两岸）的、关于它伟大的建设前途的事物。我们从萧传仁同志的谈话中知道，这条大江数千年来不仅哺育了大部分中国人民，同时也曾经是许多自然灾害的来源，终于，它要被民主中国的钢铁般的手臂彻底制服，并且驯顺地、忠实地为幸福的共产主义社会的事业服务。
    萧传仁不仅是大桥工作的专家和组织者，而且是个大思想家。他那健康而年轻的朝气蓬勃的头脑充满了美好的创造性思想，充满了对自己的伟大祖国和伟大人民的光辉前途的向往。更好的是，他，这位有才能的青年工程师不仅思考，而且行动，不仅行动，而且领导。他工作好，为人也好。他在担负建筑工程的重要职位时，无论在工作方面或待人接物方面，都是无可指责的。他对同事们的批评合情合理、谦虚而有礼貌，同时又是实事求是和要求严格的。所有这些都是好的，但是值得重视的还在于：他在谈到自己的工作，自己的成绩的时候，把它们都归功于苏联工程师科西金·德米特里·格里戈里耶维奇。
    “由于经常同科西金同志在一起，由于他的教导和具体帮助，我这个年轻的工程师才学会了领导大的建筑工作。”萧传仁同志说。
    “事实并不是这样，”身材高大、颇有年纪、长着络腮胡子的科西金同志谦逊地指出，“其实，要是笨人，教也是白教，可是萧同志很好，因为他聪明能干。” 
    在这些客气话中就深藏着中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊的根，他们互相学习的根。
    在谈到我们两国人民的友谊的时候，我不能不怀着激动的心情想起一位小姑娘——秦启全，在长江岸上，她取下自己少先队的红领巾，把它系在我的脖子上。她的话的大意是：“把我这件表达心意的少先队员的礼物送给苏联老大哥。”由于这些话的声调是那样动人，我们作家的感情使我流泪了。我除了说声“谢谢”以外，没有找到别的话来表达我对她的那种父亲般的感谢之情，而在这几分钟里面要我想出别的话语也是办不到的，因为我太感动了。我含着眼泪紧紧地拥抱她，吻她，而心里充满了快乐，因为我在这位十一岁的少先队员的脸上看到了共产主义社会的光辉前途，看到了这个社会的牢不可破的友谊。
    下面我想简单地谈谈对中国戏剧的印象，特别是关于在汉口看到的汉剧。
    我们就这样来谈谈汉剧“阿黑与阿诗玛”吧。应当说，照我看来，在中国戏剧中，特别是在京剧中，有很多幻想的、非现实主义的东西。“阿黑与阿诗玛”的价值在于：在这出戏里面，现实主义的主题压倒了幻想的成分，剧情没有对现实的特殊的夸张；它表现了普通劳动人民的现实生活，表现了他们的痛苦和幸福、忧虑和期望。
    男主角牧羊人阿黑由有经验的、演技精湛的天才演员李罗克扮演，女主角阿诗玛由年轻女演员花碧兰扮演。她的表演充满了令人信服的戏剧效果，她唱得不错，舞得也不错。如果她以后不骄傲自满，继续前进，那末毫无疑问，她将在剧坛上获得更大的荣誉。
    后来，我向剧团的工作者谈了我对“阿黑与阿诗玛”这出戏的看法。总的说来，我觉得，这个剧团在沿着正确的道路前进，在日益深入到现实主义中去。
    我现在还不知道怎样利用我访问中国时所得到的材料，但是可以相信，我将会利用这些材料写出一些东西来，因为照我看来，它们都是有趣的，因此，尽管很不充分，还是可以从某个角度表现出在社会主义中国出现的卓越事物的。我将要写它们，用各种文体来写，最诚恳地来写。
