    The First Hydrological Station Established on the Source of the Yangtze River—the Tongtian River

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch) The first hydrological station has been established on the Tongtian River, the source of the Yangtze River. On July 19th, the first water gauge was erected at Zhimenda, near Yushu, and flow measurements began. This is the first page of hydrological records in the history of the Tongtian River.

    The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission sent a group of hydrological personnel from Chongqing to the Tongtian River on June 8th to establish a hydrological station. After a journey of more than 2,800 kilometers, they crossed the Bayan Har Mountains at an altitude of 4,400 meters and sparsely populated grassland areas, arriving in Yushu, Qinghai Province, on July 10th. This group of hydrological personnel working in the uppermost reaches of the Yangtze River immediately began surveying station sites and selecting flow sections, and began surveying flow eleven days ahead of schedule.

    The Yushu Hydrological Station controls a catchment area of approximately 140,000 square meters on the Tongtian River, providing an initial understanding of the river source hydrology of the Yangtze River, which was previously unknown. The hydrological personnel have now advanced to Gangsang Temple in Zhiduo County, 200 kilometers upstream of Yushu, to continue surveying for station construction and have tentatively selected a second station site.

    长江源头—通天河上
    建立第一个水文站
    本报武汉电　长江的河源——通天河上，建立了第一个水文站。七月十九日，在玉树附近直门达竖起了第一根水尺，开始测量流量。这是通天河历史上有水文记载的第一页。
    长江水利委员会在六月八日派了一批水文工作人员由重庆前往通天河设立水文站。他们经过二千八百多公里的行程，翻越海拔四千四百公尺的巴颜喀喇山和人烟稀少的草原地带，在七月十日到达青海省玉树。这批到长江最上游工作的水文人员，一到便展开了查勘站址和选择流量段的工作，并且比原计划提前十一天开始勘测流量。
    玉树水文站控制通天河上约十四万平方公尺的集水面积，使原来一点不了解的长江河源水情得到了初步了解。这批水文工作人员目前又前进到了玉树上游二百公里的治多县岗桑寺，继续进行查勘建站工作，并初步选择了第二个站址。
