　　In the Classroom of Veteran Cadres
　　By our reporter Chen Ji

　　A little after five in the morning, as the sun was just rising, groups of veteran cadres, clutching briefcases and carrying satchels, converged on a red building.

　　This building was situated in the center of a large residential area for workers. Inside, dozens of classrooms were filled with chairs, desks, and blackboards for the teachers. On the walls of the corridors hung several oil paintings, alongside slogans like “Produce Automobiles, Produce Talent!” The entire setup resembled a school, both quiet and solemn. The advanced study class for leading cadres of the First Automobile Works was located here.

　　Ma Yi, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Materials Supply Department, was the first to enter the classroom. He had only attended elementary school and had worked in the county for a long time, learning to write simple reports, but had never touched physics or chemistry. When he first arrived at the automobile factory, he encountered many setbacks due to his lack of professional knowledge. People often brought him thick stacks of materials to review, but because he didn’t understand the specifications and properties of the materials, he made many laughable mistakes. His signature was even on some of those incorrectly purchased material orders! Each time he faced a setback, he felt the importance of learning. More than two years ago, he joined the advanced study class for leading cadres and began studying cultural and technical subjects. The first few times he did algebra problems, he broke out in a sweat; sometimes he frowned and thought all night but still couldn't hand in the assignment. At that time, the construction tasks were very demanding, and the supply of materials was even more critical. After working hard all day, he still had to do homework late into the night, and the next morning, he would go to class again. In those cold winter mornings, the sky was still dark, and he often was the first to rush into the classroom, guided by the stars. For more than two years, he never missed class without a valid reason and always completed his homework on time. He received a score of five in every subject and was awarded the title of “Excellent Student” several times. Now, he understands what properties different materials possess and has learned the mathematics, physics, and chemistry of secondary schools.

　　Han Guang, Deputy Director of the Collaborative Production Department, walked to the classroom door, greeting people with a smile. I first met him when I asked him about collaborative production issues. He methodically described the role of various collaborative products in automobiles. At that time, I really thought he was a veteran cadre who had long understood industrial knowledge; later, I learned that he used to be completely ignorant of industry. A comrade told me, "Director Han was an amateur when he first came here, but you can't say that now." Once, during an inspection, he noticed that the grooves of a V-belt were horizontal instead of vertical. He asked his colleagues in the department, "Vertical grooves provide stronger tensile force, so why are we buying horizontal ones?" After further research, they changed the order to vertical-grooved V-belts. This is an example of Han Guang applying the principles of mechanics learned in the advanced study class for leading cadres to his work. He had only attended junior high school, but now he is about to complete his secondary technical knowledge. It is said that he will soon be sent to the Changchun Automobile Tractor Institute for further study. Previously, Xu Qin, Director of the Process Department, studied here for more than a year. Because he studied well, he was transferred to Tsinghua University for advanced studies. A comrade told me, "Just wait and see, we will definitely produce several famous experts here in the future." It seems that this prediction is entirely possible.

　　At six o'clock, the bell rang for class, and the morning's hour and a half lecture began. In the classroom, only the teacher's voice could be heard. I flipped through a stack of drawings on a desk and found a well-drawn diagram that looked like it was made by an engineer. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be drawn by Shen Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Stamping Workshop. The first day I arrived at the automobile factory, I heard that Shen Zenghua studied business quickly, but I didn't know he was a good student in the advanced study class for leading cadres. A teacher told me, "Director Shen loves to ask questions when learning technology; if he doesn't understand, he goes to the machine to look; if he still doesn't understand, he asks the veteran workers and technicians. He learns one thing and understands one thing. If he doesn't understand, he always comes to us." In the spring of two years ago, he ended his long life as a secretary, came to the automobile factory from Shanghai, and became the director of the workshop. Engineers came to him every day, showed him drawings, and asked him for suggestions; he only saw parallel and intersecting straight lines and didn't understand what they meant. He was very distressed, remembering a sentence he had heard from a comrade who had been demobilized for a long time in Shanghai: "You can't run a factory well if you don't understand technology." Although some people said, "You can lead a factory even if you don't understand technology," he felt that the latter view was wrong. He strongly believed in a saying from a Soviet expert: If a workshop director sees that a die is broken and can only say, "Okay, take it for repair!" then anyone can be such a workshop director. A real workshop director should be able to specifically investigate why the die is broken, who is responsible, and how to prevent it. To investigate these issues, how can you do it without understanding technology? Shen Zenghua wanted to be a real workshop director and has been insisting on learning technology for almost two years, and now he understands general technical issues. Now, no matter what drawings he looks at, he can see them as three-dimensional objects. He is no longer afraid of not understanding drawings.

　　All three hundred and fifty veteran cadres in the advanced study class for leading cadres of the First Automobile Works share the same view as Shen Zenghua: As a leader of an industrial enterprise, you should understand technology. To understand technology, you must study. To understand what you study, you must have determination and perseverance. Many people also realized after studying technology that technology is not something mysterious; as long as you study it seriously, you can master it. When the advanced study class for leading cadres was first established in 1954, only a few dozen people participated. Some comrades listened to the first few classes, couldn't make heads or tails of them, and quit. Now they regret not having the perseverance in the beginning. Of course, it is not always smooth sailing for those who participate in learning for the first time. A general branch secretary, with a low level of education, didn't understand the lectures and was once demoted to a lower class. He once wanted to quit, but seeing that some comrades with even lower levels of education than himself were still studying well, he gritted his teeth and continued to learn. Now he feels that he is getting the hang of it. Some veteran cadres with busy work schedules find it really difficult to go to class every day. Some said, "In those winter mornings, the north wind was howling, the moonlight was bright, and I really wanted to sleep a little longer. But when I thought about the difficulties in my work, I got out of bed and went to the classroom." Some said, "We who are building the first automobile factory originally didn't have Sundays. We hardly waited for a holiday without meetings, and we really wanted to stroll around the streets. But when we thought that the homework was not done yet, we didn't want to go out and play." Now, they are all used to it, attending classes every day and reviewing every night, and they don't feel any difficulty. The director of the Technical Education Department told me, "Our veteran cadres here are already interested in learning technology. If you want them not to learn, they will all rise up in opposition." Today, they are studying physics, chemistry, algebra, drafting, metal technology, electrical engineering, engineering mechanics, and cutting principles. Soon, they are also preparing to enter night universities to study calculus and professional knowledge. They have a common determination: to truly and specifically lead the enterprise and no longer be a leader who can only give principle instructions.

    在老干部的课堂里
    本报记者　陈迹
    早晨五点多钟，太阳刚刚出来，一群群老干部手里夹着皮包，肩上挂着书包，不约而同地走进一座红色楼房。
    这座楼房坐落在一大片职工宿舍的中央。楼房里几十间教室，排满了椅子、桌子和教师用的黑板。走廊的墙壁上，挂着几幅油画，贴着“出汽车，出人材”的标语。一切布置，就像一座学校，又肃静，又庄严。第一汽车制造厂领导干部进修班就设在这里。
    基本建设材料供应处副处长马毅第一个走进了教室。他过去只读过小学，长期在县里工作，学会了写写简单的汇报，但是从来也没有摸过物理、化学。他刚到汽车厂的时候，因为不懂业务，碰过不少钉子。常有人拿来一大本资料，要他审查，因为不懂材料的规格和性能，出过不少笑话。那些错购的材料单上，也有过他的签字呵！他每次碰钉子，每次都感到学习的重要。两年多以前，他参加了领导干部进修班，开始学习文化技术。头几次做代数习题，逼出一身汗，有时候皱着眉头思考一晚上，也交不了卷。那时候，工程任务很紧张，材料供应更紧张。他忙了一天，深夜还要做习题，第二天一早，又去上课。在那寒冬的早晨，天还漆黑，他顶着星星常常第一个跑进教室。两年多了，他从不无故缺席，经常都按时做习题，门门功课，都得五分，曾经几次获得“优等生”的称号。现在，他已经懂得什么材料具有什么样的性能，也学会了中等学校的数学、物理和化学。
    协作生产处副处长韩光走到教室门口，笑眯眯地跟人打招呼。我第一次认识他，是去请问他关于协作产品的问题。他有条不紊地向我叙述了各种各样协作产品在汽车上的作用。那时候，我真以为他是个早就懂得工业知识的老干部；后来才知道，他过去对于工业完全是门外汉。有个同志告诉我：“韩处长刚来这里是外行，现在可不能这样讲。”有一次，他检查工作，发现三角皮带的纹路是横的，而不是纵的。他询问科内的同志：“纵纹路的皮带拉力强，为什么我们要买横纹路的？”后来经过研究，改订了纵纹路的三角皮带。这是韩光在领导干部进修班学了力学原理，应用在业务上的一个事例。他过去只读过初中，如今已经快学完中等技术知识。听说，不久他还要被送到长春汽车拖拉机学院去学习呢。在这以前，曾经在这里学习过一年多的工艺处处长许勤，因为学习得好，已经转到清华大学去深造了。有个同志对我说：“你等着瞧，我们这里将来总能出几个著名的专家。”看来，这个预言是完全可能实现的。
    六点钟，上课铃响起来，清晨一个半小时的讲课开始了。课堂里，只听见教师讲课的声音。我在一张桌子上翻阅一束图纸，发现一张画得很好的、像是出自工程师手笔的图样。仔细一看，原来是冲压车间副主任沈曾华画的。我到汽车厂的第一天，就听说沈曾华钻研业务很快，不过还不知道他是领导干部进修班的好学生。有个教师告诉我：“沈主任学技术，爱问；问了不懂，就到机器旁去看；看不懂，再问老工人和技术员。他学一样，懂一样。要是不懂呀，就老来问我们。”两年前的春天，他结束了长期作秘书工作的生活，从上海来到汽车厂，当上了车间主任。工程师天天找他，拿出图纸给他看，要他提意见；他只看见一条条平行的、交叉的直线，不懂得是什么意思。他很苦恼，回想着他在上海听见一位转业很久的同志说的一句话：“不懂技术，搞不好工厂。”虽然也有些人说：“领导工厂，不懂技术也可以。”但是，他觉得后一种看法是不对的。他很相信苏联专家说的一段话：如果一个车间主任看到冲模坏了，只能说：“好吧，拿去修理！”那末这样的车间主任，谁都能当。真正的车间主任就要能具体研究出冲模为什么坏，谁的责任，怎么防止。要研究这些问题，不懂技术，怎么行呢？沈曾华想要当一个真正的车间主任，坚持学习技术快两年了，已经懂得了一般的技术问题。现在，他不管看什么图纸，都能像看见了立体的实物。他已经不再害怕看不懂图纸了。
    第一汽车制造厂领导干部进修班的三百五十多名老干部，都和沈曾华抱着同样的看法：作为一个工业企业的领导者，应该懂技术。要能懂技术，就要学习。要能学懂，就要有决心、有毅力。许多人在学习技术以后也认识到，技术并不是什么神秘的东西，只要认真去钻研，就能够掌握它。1954年领导干部进修班刚开办的时候，只有几十个人参加。有的同志听了头几堂课，摸不着头脑，就退出去了。如今他们都在悔恨当初没有毅力。当然，初次参加学习的人也不是一帆风顺的。一位总支书记，文化水平低，听课不懂，曾经降了一班。他一度想退出去，但是看到有些文化水平比自己还低的同志还学习得很好，就硬着头皮学下去，现在已经感到有些门道了。一些工作比较忙的老干部，天天去上课，确实很困难。有的说：“那冬天的早晨，北风呼呼吹，月光亮堂堂，我真想多睡一会。但是想起了工作中的困难，我又从床上爬起，走进教室。”有的说：“我们这些建设第一个汽车厂的人，本来就没有星期天，好容易盼到一个没有会议的假日，真想到街上逛逛。可是一想到习题还没有做好，就不想出去玩了。”现在，他们都已经习惯了，天天听课，夜夜复习，也不觉得有什么困难了。技术教育处处长告诉我：“我们这里的老干部学习技术，已经有了兴趣。你想要他们不学，他们会群起反对。”他们今天学习着物理、化学、代数、制图、金属工艺学、电工学、工程力学和切削原理，不久还准备进夜大学，学习微积分和专业知识。他们有个共同的决心：要真正具体地领导企业，不再做一个只能作原则指示的领导人。
