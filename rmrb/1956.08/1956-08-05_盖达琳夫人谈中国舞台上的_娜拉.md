	One morning, I had the opportunity to visit the Norwegian playwright Madame Gederini, who was invited to our country.

	"Before I came to Beijing, I really wanted to know how China performs 'Nora', because Ibsen's works are not easy for Chinese actors far away from Norway to understand." The 65-year-old playwright revealed her concern about the Chinese production of "Nora" with this first sentence.

	After arriving in Beijing, Madame Gederini served as the artistic advisor for the China Youth Art Theater's production of "Nora", and enthusiastically spent almost every day with the Chinese actors and directors in the theater. Madame Gederini praised this performance of "Nora" in China. She felt that the actors in this play were all very well-chosen, whether it was Ji Shuping who played Nora, or Lan Ying who played the nanny Anna with few scenes, they both played their roles perfectly. She excitedly said: "From an artist's point of view, this production of 'Nora' is satisfactory. The Chinese actors are very cheerful and happy. These days in Beijing, I am as happy as when I am working with Norwegian colleagues."

	This old playwright, who has been engaged in drama work for forty-five years, is very frank, sincere, and strict and serious about art. She felt that the acting skills of the Chinese actors were beyond what she had imagined in the past. However, she also pointed out that sometimes the inner expressions of some actors are not deep enough. For example: In the last scene of "Nora", when something happens that damages Helmer's reputation and status, the "loving" couple falls out. When Nora suddenly realizes that she has been her husband's doll for eight years and firmly expresses her desire to leave her husband and go away, the inner emotions expressed by the actress playing Nora are obviously not strong enough.

	As I was about to say goodbye, Madame Gederini also enthusiastically expressed that "Nora" has been brought to the Chinese stage, and everything from the stage atmosphere to the set has been Norwegianized. She repeatedly said modestly: "I worked with Mr. Wu Xue to rehearse this play, so it is difficult to talk about its merits and demerits. I hope that the drama critics will evaluate it!"

    盖达琳夫人谈中国舞台上的“娜拉”
    孙世恺
    一天上午，我有机会访问了应邀来我国的挪威戏剧家盖达琳夫人。
    “我来北京以前非常想知道中国怎样演‘娜拉’，因为易卜生的作品对远离挪威的中国演员来说是不好了解的。”这位年已六十五岁高龄的老戏剧家头一句话就道出她关怀中国排演“娜拉”的心情。
    盖达琳夫人到北京后担任了中国青年艺术剧院排演“娜拉”的艺术顾问，几乎每天都热情地和中国的演员、导演在剧场里一起生活。盖达琳夫人向我称赞了“娜拉”这次在中国的演出。她觉得这出戏的演员都选择得非常适宜，不论是扮演娜拉的演员冀淑平，或是没有多少戏的保姆安娜扮演者篮樱，都演得恰到好处。她兴奋地说：“从一个艺术家的观点来看这次排演的‘娜拉’是令人满意的。中国演员的心情非常开朗愉快，这些日子我在北京，像和挪威的同行搞工作时候一样快活。”
    这位从事戏剧工作已有四十五年的老戏剧家十分坦率、诚挚，对待艺术是严格而认真。她感到中国演员的演技是过去想不到的。但是，她也指出有时有的演员的内心表情还不够深刻。例如：在“娜拉”最后一场，当一件有损海尔茂名誉和地位的事情发生，因此这对“相爱”的夫妇闹翻了。娜拉突然明白自己做了丈夫八年的玩偶，坚决地表示要离开丈夫出走的时候，扮演娜拉的演员所表达的内心情感显然还不够有力。
    我要告辞时，盖达琳夫人还热情地表示，“娜拉”搬上了中国舞台，从舞台气氛到布景都已做到了挪威化。她一再谦虚地说：“我和吴雪先生一起排演这出戏，很难谈它的好坏，希望戏剧评论家们来评价吧！”
