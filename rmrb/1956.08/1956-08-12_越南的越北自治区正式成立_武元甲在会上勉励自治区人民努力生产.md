Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: A new national autonomous region—the Viet Bac Autonomous Region—has been established in the rich and beautiful mountainous area of Viet Bac.

The opening ceremony of the founding conference was held today in Thai Nguyen City, the famous "Resistance Capital" of Vietnam. Approximately one thousand representatives of the various ethnic groups in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region and representatives from other parts of Vietnam attended. The ten-day conference is scheduled to discuss the tasks of the autonomous region, formulate regulations for the organization of the government, and elect the administrative committee of the autonomous region.

At the beginning of the conference, the representatives warmly applauded the delegation of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government led by Deputy Prime Minister Vo Nguyen Giap, the Vietnamese national delegation, representatives from other parts of Vietnam, the delegation of Soviet experts, and the delegation of China's Guangxi Province led by Qin Yingji. Qin Yingji of China was also elected to the presidium of the conference.

Vo Nguyen Giap spoke at the meeting first, pointing out that the Viet Bac mountainous area is one of the birthplaces of the Vietnamese revolution and an old base area during the period of resistance against war. The people of Viet Bac have made great contributions to the resistance against war. He said that the establishment of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region is a victory for the national policy of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese government. The purpose of this policy is to enable all ethnic groups to achieve equality, unity, progress, and prosperity.

Vo Nguyen Giap continued to point out that at present, the various ethnic groups in South Vietnam are still under the malicious division and cruel oppression of imperialist forces. Therefore, the establishment of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region is not only a victory for the people of northern Vietnam but will also have a significant impact on all fraternal ethnic groups in the country.

Vo Nguyen Giap finally encouraged the people of the autonomous region to work hard in production, develop the economy, and improve culture, so that the people can live a happier and more fulfilling life day by day.

The Viet Bac Autonomous Region established today covers an area of approximately 26,000 square kilometers, including the provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen (excluding Phu Binh and Pho Yen counties), Tuyen Quang (excluding An Binh county), and Huu Lung county in Bac Giang province. It has a population of more than 790,000, including 11 ethnic groups such as the Tay, Nung, Kinh, and Man.

Another autonomous region in Vietnam is the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region in northwestern Vietnam, which was established in May last year.

    武元甲在会上勉励自治区人民努力生产
    新华社河内10日电　一个新的民族自治区——越北自治区在富饶幽美的越北山区成立了。
    成立大会的开幕典礼今天在越南著名的“抗战首都”太原市举行，到有越北自治区各族人民的代表和越南其它各地代表约有一千人。预定要开十天的大会将讨论自治区的任务，制定政权的组织条例，以及选出自治区的行政委员会。
    大会开始时，代表们热烈鼓掌欢迎武元甲副总理率领的越南劳动党和政府的代表团、越南民族代表团和越南其它各地的代表，以及苏联专家代表团和由覃应机率领的中国广西省民族代表团，中国的覃应机还被选入了大会主席团。
    武元甲首先在会上讲话，他指出，越北山区是越南革命的策源地和抗战时期的老根据地之一，越北人民曾经对抗战作出了巨大的贡献。他说，越北自治区的成立是越南劳动党和越南政府民族政策的胜利。这个政策的目的在于使各族人民达到平等、团结、进步和繁荣。
    武元甲继续指出，目前南越各民族还处在帝国主义势力的恶毒分化和残酷压迫之下，因此，越北自治区的成立不仅是越南北方人民的胜利，而且也将对全国各兄弟民族起重大的影响。
    武元甲最后勉励自治区人民努力生产、发展经济、提高文化，使人民一天天生活得更加愉快幸福。
    今天成立的越北自治区面积约有两万六千平方公里，包括高平、谅山、北?、太原（富平、普安两县除外）、宣光（安平县除外）等省和北江省的右陇县，人口有七十九万多人，包括士、侬、京、曼等十一个民族。
