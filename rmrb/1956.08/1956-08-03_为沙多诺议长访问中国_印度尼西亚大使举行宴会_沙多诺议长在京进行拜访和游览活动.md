Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - The Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wirjopranoto, held a banquet tonight for Speaker Sartono and his wife's visit to China.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Speaker Sartono and his wife, as well as the Indonesian parliamentarians who came to China for the visit, attended the banquet.

Wirjopranoto said in his speech at the meeting that this gathering is very meaningful, because this banquet gives the Speaker of the Indonesian Republic's Parliament and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China the opportunity to meet, and this gathering can also symbolize the gathering of the people's will and sovereignty of the two countries.

Wirjopranoto said that it is a very obvious fact that the will of the people is the foundation of all activities of the government and its leaders. The primary desire of the people is to have lasting peace, which precisely means that the people are against war and all threats of war.

He pointed out that in the effort to strive for peace, the ten principles agreed upon at the Asian-African Conference in Bandung will play a significant role.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi then delivered a speech, saying that although Speaker Sartono and other friends only arrived in Beijing yesterday, we have already become very close friends. This harmonious and congenial atmosphere between us has a deep foundation.

Liu Shaoqi said that China and Indonesia have both suffered the painful experience of colonialism and have long had common experiences and demands. As newly independent countries, the friendly cooperation between the people of our two countries is very natural. The Chinese people are deeply confident in the healthy and developing friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. There is an old Chinese saying: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." More contact and visits between our two countries' parliaments, governments, and peoples can continuously enhance the friendship between the two countries.

Also invited to attend tonight's banquet were Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and members in Beijing, Vice-Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun and Li Xiannian, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Hu Yuzhi, Vice-President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, and heads of other people's organizations, Vice-Mayor of Beijing Xue Zizheng, and people from all walks of life.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, Speaker Sartono of the Indonesian Parliament and the Indonesian parliamentarians who came to China with him visited the leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China this afternoon and had talks.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi introduced the relevant situation of the National People's Congress to the guests, and the hosts and guests also exchanged views and held discussions on issues such as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Also present at the discussion were Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Wu Kejian, Yu Xinqing, and Xin Zhichao, Deputy Secretaries-General, and Zhong Qingfa, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia.

Speaker Sartono and his wife, along with the visiting parliamentarians, toured the Summer Palace today in the drizzling rain.
