    Due to my own low level of understanding, and being unprincipledly influenced by certain rigid rules and regulations in musical composition, I have had some contradictions and concerns in my creative thinking in recent years.

    Should I write popular songs? This is what workers, peasants, and soldiers need most at the moment. I wrote the interlude "Song of the Dockworkers" for the film "Gate No. 6." Before the film was even released, some comrades said, "Listen to Nie Er's 'Song of the Dockworkers', it's so good!" This kind of standard made me feel that before I was very familiar with workers' lives, it would be better to write something else. Then, should I write solo songs? But I was afraid of being said to be showing off skills for soloists, so I wrote them in a bland and tasteless way. No wonder a singer told me after performing my "Wearing a Big Red Flower" that she used to like singing songs I wrote, but this song disappointed her. Should I write choral pieces? For fear of being said to like complex forms and diluting the national style of the melody, I was timid in the handling of harmony and even included a solo section. When I wrote the interlude "For the Fragrant Flowers and Sweet Fruits" for the film "Youth's Garden," I used a little counterpoint to express youthful vitality, but some people thought it exceeded the level of the masses. Should I write symphonies? I was even more afraid of being said to be pursuing grand style, so in the process of writing the "First Symphony," I often thought, "Wait for the criticism." It was not until I saw Comrade Shen Yanbing's speech at the National People's Congress, which clearly pointed out that we need popular songs and also symphonies, that I felt relieved. During this Music Week, I heard many musical works of different content and form; these colorful and brilliant musical flowers gave me education and inspiration. My immature works also got the opportunity to be performed and listen to opinions; especially when I encountered frustration and difficulty in moving forward on the road of musical creation, it really gave me great encouragement. I sincerely feel that the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy advocated by the Party and Chairman Mao is wise, correct, and timely. In the future, I will boldly create more works for the people.

    The holding of the First National Music Week not only strengthened the unity of the national music circles and expanded the scope of exchange of advanced experience in musical creation, but also played a great role in liberating musical creative forces. However, this is only the beginning of a new stage of prosperous musical creation. I sincerely hope that at the time of Music Week, a symposium on organizational work can also be held to discuss the issue of organizing musical creation institutions in conjunction with the Twelve-Year Plan. Some comrades said that in some positions, the production relations have now developed to the point of restricting the productive forces. Composers in film music positions feel this especially deeply. Isn't this a problem worthy of attention?

    随想曲
    王云阶
    由于自己的认识水平低，无原则地受了音乐创作上一些清规戒律的影响，因而近年来在我的创作思想上有着一些矛盾和顾虑。
    写群众歌曲吧，这是目前最合乎工农兵需要的。我写了影片“六号门”的插曲“搬运工人歌”；影片还没有公映之前，就有同志说：“你听聂耳的‘码头工人歌’多好啊！”这种规格一来，使我觉得在没很熟悉工人生活之前，还是先写点别的为妙。那么，写独唱曲吧，但又怕说是为独唱家卖弄技巧，因而写得平平稳稳，淡而无味。难怪有一位歌唱家在表演了我的“戴起一朵大红花”之后告诉我：她过去很喜欢唱我写的歌，但是这首歌却使她失望。写合唱曲吧，为了怕说喜欢搞复杂形式，又怕冲淡了曲调的民族风格，在和声的处理上既胆小，还去夹上一段独唱。我写影片“青春的园地”中的插曲“为了花香果又甜”时，为了表现青春活力而采用了一点复音乐的手法，又有人认为超出了群众的水平。写交响乐吧，更怕说是追求大气派，所以在写“第一交响乐”的过程中，常常想“等着挨批评吧”。直到看见报上登载的沈雁冰部长在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言中，明确指出我们需要群众歌曲，也需要交响乐之后，我才放下心来。这次音乐周中，我听到了许多不同的内容和形式的音乐作品；这些色彩丰富、缤纷灿烂的音乐花朵，给了我教育和启发。我的不成熟的作品也得到了演出和听取意见的机会；特别是正当我在音乐创作的道路上遇到苦闷、举步艰难的时候，真是给了我莫大的鼓励。我衷心地感到党和毛主席所倡导的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的英明、正确和及时。今后我要大胆地为人民创作更多的作品。
    第一届全国音乐周的举行，不仅加强了全国音乐界的团结，扩大了音乐创作上先进经验的交流范围，同时也在解放音乐创作力方面起了很大的作用。然而，这还只是繁荣音乐创作的新阶段的开端，我衷心地盼望在音乐周举行之际，也能召开有关组织工作的座谈会，结合十二年规划，讨论组织音乐创作的机构问题。有的同志讲，某些岗位上现在已经发展到生产关系束缚生产力的情况了。这样的感受，在电影音乐岗位上的作曲家体会得特别深。——这难道不是值得注意的问题吗？
