    Promote the advanced producer movement in a deep and lasting way
    Nanjing Railway Sub-bureau conducts comprehensive investigation and research
    Carrying out specific work based on the specific situation of each employee
    (Our newspaper's report) Since the Nanjing Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Railway Bureau launched the advanced producer movement, many quota targets have been broken, and there have been many rationalization proposals. However, production tasks have not been completed well, and many key problems in production have not been resolved. For example, the problem of coal waste and inability to climb slopes in the locomotive section's transportation workshop has not been solved. In the first quarter of this year alone, more than 110 tons of coal were wasted, and the cost of coal usually accounts for 75% of the sub-bureau's total expenditure.
    In light of this situation, the sub-bureau's leadership decided to conduct an investigation and research work.
    They first investigated the various planned targets of each unit and grasped all the changes in the advanced and the backward. For example, in the locomotive section's transportation workshop, they found that among all the workers, 29 were originally advanced and are now even more advanced, 10 had changed from advanced to backward, 26 had changed from backward to advanced, 64 had generally caught up with the advanced, and 42 were backward.
    They continued their investigation and research, identifying each person's strengths and weaknesses. They found that advanced people were not advanced in every indicator, and backward people were not backward in everything; at the same time, they also discovered that some people who were previously considered advanced had already fallen behind, while some who had always been regarded as backward were actually advanced producers who had not had an accident for several years. For example, driver Li Fawen, whom the leadership previously considered to be fond of drinking and ideologically backward, was only now discovered to have a whole set of experience in climbing slopes. These examples were a great education to the leadership.
    After clarifying who was advanced and who was backward, they analyzed each worker's technical level, ideological awareness, and family life to find out why the backward could become advanced and the advanced could become backward.
    After finding the reasons, they helped workers with poor technical skills to improve their skills; helped people with ideological problems to solve their ideological problems; and also helped people with difficulties in their lives to overcome them in a timely manner. For example, Liu Wenjing, a dispatcher at Nanjing Station, used to feel that the leadership always regarded him as a backward element, so he gave up on himself and did not seek progress. This time, the leadership assigned assistant team leader and Party member Yu Haijian and branch committee member Sun Xingfa to specifically help him, and the general branch secretary also talked to him, which greatly moved him and expressed his determination to work hard; in late April, he alone proposed five rationalization proposals and also performed very well in production.
    After the investigation and analysis, the specific situations of some people with poor technical skills were clarified. Party organizations, administrative departments, trade unions, Communist Youth League workers, and technical personnel started from the different problems existing in the groups and individuals, and formulated a comprehensive plan for promoting advanced experience by using the method of supplementing what is lacking. The content of the plan included who would learn, what to learn, the date, purpose, and requirements of learning, the person in charge, the inspector, and specific measures. For example, when the Nanjing Locomotive Depot promoted Li Fawen's slope-climbing experience, it was determined that the operation section chief and the operation engineer would be specifically responsible for the promotion, and the expected result was to eliminate the accidents of not being able to climb slopes on the Ningwu Line starting from the second half of May. After the plan was formulated, a monthly implementation plan was also formulated, and workers were organized to consciously incorporate learning advanced experience into their individual or group plans.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, an inspection system was established. After the plan was formulated, the leadership also held a discussion meeting, inviting workers of the same type of work to exchange operational experience and introduce advanced operating methods. They also invited experienced people to demonstrate on each locomotive. In order to solve the problem of not being able to climb slopes on the Ningwu Line, the Nanjing Locomotive Depot successively organized three discussion meetings, inviting veteran driver Li Fawen to introduce his slope-climbing experience. Now the problem of not being able to climb slopes in this section has been basically solved. From April to July 29, 685 tons and 276 kilograms of coal have been saved.

### 让先进生产者运动深入持久地开展  南京铁路分局全面进行调查研究  针对每个职工的具体情况进行具体工作

    让先进生产者运动深入持久地开展
    南京铁路分局全面进行调查研究
    针对每个职工的具体情况进行具体工作
    本报讯　上海铁路局南京分局自从开展先进生产者运动以来，定额指标突破了很多，合理化建议也不少。但是生产任务完成得不好，生产上许多关键问题没有解决。如机务段运转车间浪费煤和爬不上坡等问题就没有解决。今年第一季度浪费了一百一十多吨煤，平时煤的费用要占分局全部开支的75％。
    根据这种情况，分局领导上决定进行一次调查研究工作。
    他们首先调查了每一个单位的各项计划指标，掌握了全部先进和落后的变动情况。像机务段运转车间就发现全部工人中，原来先进现在更先进的有二十九人，先进变成落后的有十人，落后变为先进的有二十六人，一般赶上先进的有六十四人，落后的有四十二人。
    他们又继续调查研究，找出了每个人的长处和短处。他们发现，先进的人不是每一项指标都先进，落后的也不是样样落后；同时又发觉以前一向认为先进的人有些已经落后了，而一贯被看成落后的人，有的倒是几年不出事故的先进生产者。如司机李发文，以前领导上认为他爱喝酒，思想落后，这次才发现了他在爬坡上有一整套经验。这些事例给领导上很大的教育。
    弄清楚谁先进谁落后以后，他们又从每个工人的技术水平、思想觉悟以及家庭生活等方面进行分析，找出了为什么落后的会转变为先进、先进的又会变为落后的原因。
    找出了原因以后，就帮助技术不高的工人提高技术；帮助思想有问题的人解决思想问题；对生活有困难的人，也及时帮助他们克服困难。如南京站调度员刘文静过去觉得领导上总把他看作落后分子，因此自暴自弃、不求进步，这次领导上指定助理班长党员余海建、支部委员孙兴发去具体帮助他，总支书记也找他谈心，使他大为感动，表示一定要好好干；四月下旬，他一个人就提出了五项合理化建议，在生产上也表现得很好。
    调查分析以后，对一些技术差的人的具体情况都摸清楚了，党组织、行政、工会、青年团工作人员和技术人员就从小组、个人存在的不同问题出发，以缺什么补什么的方法，制定出推广先进经验的全面规划。规划的内容包括谁来学，学什么，学会的日期、目的、要求，负责人、检查人和具体措施。如南京机务段推广李发文的爬坡经验时，确定由运用段长、运用工程师具体负责推广，预期效果自五月下半月起消灭宁芜线爬不上坡的事故。规划订出以后，还制定了每月实施计划，组织职工自觉地把学习先进经验订到个人的或小组的计划里去。
    为了保证规划的实施，又订立了检查制度。规划订好以后，领导上又召开座谈会，邀请同工种的工人交流操作心得，介绍先进的操作方法。还请有经验的人到各台机车上去示范。南京机务段为了解决宁芜线上爬不上坡的问题，连续组织了三次座谈会，邀请老司机李发文介绍他的爬坡经验。现在这个段爬不上坡的问题已经基本上解决。四月到七月二十九日已经节约了六百八十五吨二百七十六公斤煤。
