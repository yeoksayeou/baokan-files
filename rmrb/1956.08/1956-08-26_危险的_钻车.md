    Dangerous "Drilling Under Trains"
    Whenever passengers change trains at the Taolai Zhao Station, they feel uneasy. This station has neither an overpass nor an underpass, so passengers have to crawl under the freight cars parked between the two platforms to get from one platform to the other. The train conductors urge them on from behind: "Hurry up, hurry up, the train is about to leave!" So, mothers shout, children cry, and old people fall and get up again, it's simply a tense struggle. On May 3rd of this year, an elderly person broke their head while crawling under a train and fainted on the spot, only regaining consciousness more than an hour later. Some passengers have just crawled through, before even straightening up, and the train starts moving. Some children climb on the couplings of the carriages and are carried one station away by the train...
    To ensure the safety of passengers, the Taolai Zhao Station should find a way to build an overpass.

    危险的“钻车”
    每当旅客在陶赖昭车站换车的时候，心里便惴惴不安。原来这个车站既无天桥，又无地道，旅客要从这个站台到那个站台，只得从停满在两个站台中间的货车底下钻过去。列车员则紧跟在后面催：“快钻，快钻，车子快开了。”于是，妈妈喊、孩子叫，老人们摔倒了又爬起，简直是一场紧张的搏斗。今年五月三日，就有一位上了年岁的人在钻车时磕破了脑袋，当场昏了过去，隔了一个多钟头才醒过来。有的旅客刚钻过来，腰还没有挺直，车就开了。有的孩子爬在车辆的挂钩上，被列车带出一站之地……
    为了保障旅客的安全，陶赖昭车站应该设法修建天桥。	  王志仁等
