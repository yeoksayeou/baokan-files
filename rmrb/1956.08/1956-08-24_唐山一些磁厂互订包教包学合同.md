Tangshan, August (Tangshan Labor Daily) - Recently, the Dongquan Shun and Hongxing ceramic factories, the Yilai Ju and Zhiyuan Cheng ceramic factories, and the Xinxing and Gongjucheng ceramic factories in Tangshan City have signed mutual teaching and learning contracts to conduct inter-factory technical assistance. Other ceramic factories will continue to sign such contracts.

These factories all produce the same products and have similar equipment conditions. However, each factory has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of production management and technical operation methods, and the product quality varies greatly. For example, the first-class rate of large vats produced by Dongquanshun Ceramic Factory is 87.5%, while the first-class rate of large vats produced by Hongxing Ceramic Factory is only about 81%. The mutual teaching and learning contract between these two factories stipulates that Hongxing Ceramic Factory will learn from Dongquanshun Ceramic Factory's raw material formula and flame control kiln firing method to solve problems such as broken edges in the production of large vats. Zhiyuan Cheng and Gongjucheng Ceramic Factories will learn from the experience of Yilai Ju and Xinxing Ceramic Factories in making ceramic pipes to overcome the shortcomings of semi-finished products being crooked and cracked. These contracts also specifically stipulate the methods of teaching and learning, sending people to the other factory to study or practice within a certain period of time, frequently studying the problems that occur in production, and helping to solve them, so that backward factories can quickly reach advanced levels.

    唐山一些磁厂互订包教包学合同
    本报讯　唐山市东全顺和红星磁厂、义来局和致远成磁厂、新兴和公聚成磁厂之间，近几天来分别签订了包教包学合同，进行厂际技术互助。其他各磁厂也将继续签订这种合同。
    这些厂都有同样的产品，设备条件也差不多。但是在生产管理和技术操作方法上各厂互有优缺点，产品质量相差很多。像东全顺磁厂所产大缸的甲级率是87.5％，红星磁厂大缸甲级率只81％左右。这两厂的包教包学合同中规定，红星磁厂学习东全顺磁厂的原料配方和控制火焰烧窑法，解决生产大缸断沿等问题。致远成和公聚成两磁厂分别学习义来局和新兴两磁厂制陶管的经验，克服半成品歪裂的缺点。这些合同中还具体地规定教和学的方法，在一定的时间内派人到对方厂去学习或实习，经常研究生产中所发生的问题，并且帮助解决，使落后厂迅速达到先进水平。
