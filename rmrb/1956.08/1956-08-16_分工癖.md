    Division-of-Labor Obsession
    Li Jian
    Let's start with an example.
    Suppose you want to buy books. A magazine for your spouse, some picture books for the children, a textbook for your younger brother, and finally, a newly published "classic" for yourself. Now, please calculate, how many "stores" of Xinhua Bookstore do you need to visit? At least four Xinhua Bookstore branches. If you are not familiar with the situation, you might visit three branches just for one textbook.
    Needless to say, even within one branch, there is division of labor. Finding the book, issuing the invoice, paying the bill, picking up the book, and sometimes, you have to queue up for each of these.
    I personally heard two people grumbling in a bookstore. One said: "Buying books is not like seeing a doctor, why do they have to divide it into internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics... so much?" The other disagreed: "The hospital's divisions are all within the same hospital, but the bookstore's divisions make you run all over Beijing. Moreover, one person is unlikely to have four or five diseases at the same time, but I, on the other hand, have to buy four or five different kinds of books."
    Is buying books the only thing with this kind of difficulty? Of course not, let's talk about getting medicine when you're sick. Take the prescription to a traditional Chinese medicine shop, first take a number, wait to be billed, pay the money, and then you queue up to get the medicine. -- This is the new rule, supposedly "scientific division of labor."
    Let's talk about making clothes. The division of labor is: 1. Measure dimensions, 2. Choose fabric, 3. Choose lining, 4. Choose interlining, 5. Issue three or four invoices, calculate the total, 6. Pay the money and get a receipt. At the very least, you have to run back and forth five or six times. -- This is also a new rule, and of course, it is another "scientific division of labor."
    Examples can go on and on.
    It is said that the division-of-labor obsession has spread to the arts. The example is that song and dance should be divided: singers don't dance, dancers don't sing, and even Peking opera is tending to become mime and acrobatics.
    For the convenience of buying books, some people shout: "Long live Dong'an Market," because it is not very scientific here, there is no division of labor, and buying books is more convenient. Then, in the future, maybe someone will shout: "Long live Tianqiao," because there, perhaps, a little of the national tradition of singing and dancing can still survive.

    分工癖

    先举例。
    假如你要买书。给爱人买一本杂志，给孩子们买几本小人书，给弟弟买一本教科书，最后是自己想买一本新出版的“古籍”。这样，请你算算，要跑“几家”新华书店？最少是四家新华书店门市部。假如不熟悉情况，为了一本教科书，可能跑上三个门市部。
    不必说，一家门市部内还要分工。找书，开发票，付账，取书，有时还得一一排队。
    我亲自听到过两个人在书店里发牢骚，一个说：“买书又不像看病，干吗要内科、外科、小儿科……的分得这么多。”另一个不同意：“医院的分科同在一个院子里，书店分了科却要你跑遍北京城，况且，一个人不太可能同时生上四五种病，而我，却硬是要买四五种不同科别的书。”
    单单买书有这种困难么？不然，就讲生了病抓药吧。拿药方到中药铺，先拿牌子，等着算账，付款，然后给你排队抓药。——这是新规矩，据说是“科学化的分工”。
    再讲做衣服。分工是：一、量尺寸，二、选料子，三、选里子，四、选衬绸，五、开上三四张发票，结总账，六、付款拿收条。最少，你得来回跑上五六趟。——这也是新规矩，当然又是“科学的分工”。
    例子可以一直举下去。
    听说，分工癖流传到了艺术界，例子是歌舞要分工：歌者不舞，舞者不歌，连京剧也有变为哑剧和杂技的趋势。
    为了买书方便，有人喊：“东安市场万岁”，因为这里不太科学，没有分工，买书比较方便。那么，将来也许有人会喊：“天桥万岁”吧，因为在那里，也许还能苟延一点载歌载舞的民族传统。
