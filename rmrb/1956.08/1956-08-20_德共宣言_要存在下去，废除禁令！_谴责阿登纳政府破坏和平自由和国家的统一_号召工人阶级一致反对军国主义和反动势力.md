Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 19th: The "Neues Deutschland" of August 18th published the declaration of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party: "The German Communist Party Must Exist! Abolish the Ban!" The full text of the declaration is as follows:

A despicable thing has happened. Under pressure from the Adenauer government, the Federal Constitutional Court has declared the German Communist Party banned and ordered its dissolution.

The German Communist Party still exists and will continue to exist. This is required by the interests of the working class and the people.

The verdict against the German Communist Party was pronounced for the sake of German monopoly capitalists, militarists, and American financial groups. The people will never recognize this verdict against the German Communist Party, because it is detrimental to peace, freedom, and the reunification of the country.

The Adenauer government has been suppressing the German Communist Party since 1954, when it began implementing the extremely harmful policy of rearmament. Since it wants to complete conscription against the will of the people, it must deprive the German Communist Party of its legitimacy. Therefore, the Karlsruhe verdict is an unprecedented attack by militarists on peace, on the vital interests of the German people, and on European security.

The banning of a German and democratic party—the German Communist Party—and the deprivation of its members of parliament's mandates, shows how democracy is being trampled upon in the Federal Republic. It is a verdict against workers' rights, trade union rights, and the right to strike. Now, the entire German and world public sees what kind of anti-democratic regime is ruling the Federal Republic, and how much progress fascism has made. It has once again taken a big step on the road of 1933, the road of suppressing the working-class movement. By banning the German Communist Party, the Adenauer government has become the most reactionary government in Europe. The banning of the German Communist Party reveals that the rulers of the Federal Republic are irreconcilable enemies of German reunification. It is now clear that monopoly capitalists and militarists are hopelessly pursuing their so-called policy of strength, and still want to create a fait accompli before the end of the Adenauer era. Their adventurous and dangerous policy is a sign of the weakness of German imperialists. They are alarmed by the growing resistance of the working class and the people to militarism and conscription. Therefore, they want to eliminate the German Communist Party, which is one of the most powerful forces for peace and democracy.

However, the enemies of the working class and the people have miscalculated. The people know that those who are persecuted by the Adenauer government belong to the people.

The German Communist Party cannot be eliminated, and it can never be destroyed. It is flesh and blood with the German working class. The German Communist Party is deeply rooted in the working class and the people, because it represents the interests of the working class and the people.

At this dangerous moment, the German Communist Party calls for the realization of united action by the working class and collective action by all the people's forces against German militarism and monopoly capitalism, to end the deeply harmful Adenauer era. The German Communist Party will fight to defend the rights of the working class, to implement the action program of the West German Trade Union Federation, to fundamentally change the policies in the Federal Republic in order to move towards peace, democracy and social progress, and to build a peaceful, unified, and indivisible German Republic for our people that advances towards socialism.

Wherever there are the working class and the people, there are we, the Communists. We work there for the collective action of the workers and for marching forward together with our comrades in the Social Democratic Party. We Communists will always bravely represent the interests of the people in the struggle against conscription. Therefore, the working class will build a strong protective wall around us, a wall that the enemy's terror measures cannot break through.

The German Communist Party thanks everyone, especially the comrades in the trade unions and the Social Democratic Party. They have demonstrated their fraternal solidarity (with the German Communist Party) in the face of the threat of the ban. This guarantees that the working class and the people will more resolutely put forward their slogan: Give freedom to the German Communist Party! Abolish the ban! Restore the constitutional rights of the German Communist Party!

If the Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation do their best for this purpose, the ban on the German Communist Party could have been prevented in the first place, and can be abolished in the future. Therefore, it is necessary for some Social Democratic leaders to abandon their passive attitude, which will encourage reactionary forces and weaken the cause of peace and democracy as well as the position of their own organizations.

After the German Communist Party was banned, the Social Democratic Party and the trade unions now have a greater responsibility, together with the Communists, to prevent the Adenauer regime from further moving towards a militarist dictatorship. Due to the urgency of time and the enormity of the danger, brotherly joint efforts are needed.

Now, thanks to the creative power of a billion people, the world has embarked on the road of peace, democracy, and socialism. The German Democratic Republic has also completely eradicated imperialism and militarism and is building socialism. In such an era, Adenauer, Schroeder, Globke, and Heusinger actually believe that they can turn back the wheels of history.

They are all striving against historical development—Bismarck with his anti-socialist laws, Hitler with his bloody terror. Just as they have fallen, so will all those who strive to destroy Marxism, to destroy the doctrine of the victory of the working class, and the German Communist Party (the party of Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Thälmann) be defeated.

The German Communist Party will exist and will stand at the forefront of the working class and the people long after the Adenauer era has ended. The German Communist Party has always grown in struggle. It will also strengthen itself in this struggle. Those who judge the Communists today will be judged by the people tomorrow.

Now, comrades and friends, throw yourselves into the new struggle! Do not let those who want to make Germany without peace get peace! Do not let those who want to strangle peace and democracy get freedom! Do not let those who want to disturb the tranquility of our children, the sleep of our mothers, and the lives of our people get tranquility!

May the people of our beloved German nation have peace, freedom, and progress! Join the German Communist Party against militarism and reaction, for democracy and socialism! The people are with us, and victory will surely belong to us.

The Central Committee of the German Communist Party
Düsseldorf, August 17, 1956

    德共宣言“要存在下去，废除禁令！”
    谴责阿登纳政府破坏和平自由和国家的统一
    号召工人阶级一致反对军国主义和反动势力
    新华社柏林19日电　八月十八日的“新德意志报”发表了德国共产党中央委员会的宣言：“德国共产党要存在下去！废除禁令！”宣言全文如下：
    卑鄙的事情已经发生。在阿登纳政府的压力下，联邦宪法法院已经宣布禁止德国共产党，并且命令它解散。
    德国共产党仍然存在，并且将继续存在下去。这是工人阶级和人民的利益所需要的。
    对德国共产党的判决是为了德国垄断资本家、军国主义分子和美国大财团而宣布的，人民将永远不会承认对德国共产党的这一判决，因为它是不利于和平、自由和国家的重新统一的。
    阿登纳政府从1954年开始实行为害极大的重新武装政策以来，就对德国共产党施行镇压。既然它想要违反人民的意愿来完成征兵工作，它就得剥夺德国共产党的合法性。因此，卡尔斯卢厄的判决是军国主义分子对和平、对德国人民的切身利益和对欧洲安全的一项闻所未闻的进攻。
    禁止一个德国的和民主的政党——德国共产党，并且剥夺它的议员的委任状，这表明了民主在联邦共和国受到怎样的践踏。它是对工人权利、对工会和罢工权利的一个判决。现在，整个德国和世界的公众都看到一个甚么样的反民主政权在统治着联邦共和国，法西斯主义又取得了多么大的进展。它已经又一次大步跨上了1933年的道路，镇压工人阶级运动的道路。由于禁止德国共产党，阿登纳政府已经成为欧洲最反动的政府。禁止德国共产党这件事暴露出联邦共和国的统治者是德国重新统一的不共戴天的仇人。现在已经可以看得很明显，垄断资本家和军国主义分子毫无希望地在走着他们的所谓实力政策的道路，而且现在仍然想在阿登纳时代终止以前造成既成事实。他们的冒险而危险的政策是德国帝国主义分子软弱的表现。他们因为工人阶级和人民对军国主义和征兵的反抗日益增长而感到惊慌。因此，他们想消灭作为争取和平和民主的一支最有力的力量的德国共产党。
    但是，工人阶级和人民的敌人估计错了。谁遭到阿登纳政府的迫害，人民就知道他们是属于人民的。
    德国共产党是取消不了的，而且是永远消灭不了的，它同德国工人阶级是血肉相连的。德国共产党在工人阶级和人民中间是根深蒂固的，因为它代表的是工人阶级和人民的利益。
    在这个危险的时刻，德国共产党号召实现工人阶级的一致行动以及一切人民力量的集体行动，来反对德国军国主义和垄断资本主义，以结束为害不浅的阿登纳时代。德国共产党将为保卫工人阶级的权利，为实现西德工会联合会的行动纲领，为在联邦共和国根本改变政策以便走向和平、民主和社会进步，并且为我国人民建设一个向社会主义前进的和平、统一的不可分割的德意志共和国而斗争。
    凡是有工人阶级和人民的地方，都有我们共产党人。我们在那里为了工人的集体行动并且为了同社会民主党的同志们一同前进而工作。我们共产党人在反对征兵的斗争中永远勇敢地代表人民的利益。因此，工人阶级将在我们周围建立起一道巩固的保护墙，这道墙是敌人的恐怖措施攻不破的。
    德国共产党感谢大家，尤其感谢工会和社会民主党里的同志们。他们证明了他们在反对禁令的威胁中（同德国共产党）的兄弟般的团结。这保证了工人阶级和人民更坚决地提出他们的口号：给德国共产党以自由！取消禁令！恢复德国共产党的宪法权利！
    如果社会民主党和西德工会联合会为这个目的竭尽全力，对德国共产党的禁令起初是可以防止的，并且今后也是可以废除的。因此某些社会民主党领袖有必要放弃他们的消极态度，他们的这种态度将会鼓励反动力量，并且会削弱和平和民主的事业以及他们自己的组织的地位。
    在德国共产党遭到禁止后，社会民主党和工会现在在同共产党人一起阻止阿登纳政权进一步走向军国主义的独裁国家方面负有更大的责任。由于时间紧迫和危险巨大，因此需要进行兄弟般的共同努力。
    现在，由于十亿人民的创造性力量，世界已经踏上和平、民主和社会主义的道路，德意志民主共和国也已经彻底铲除了帝国主义和军国主义，并且正在建设社会主义。而在这样的时代，阿登纳、施罗德、格罗德克和豪辛格之流竟然相信他们能够扭转历史的车轮。
    他们都竭力反对历史发展——俾斯麦用他的反社会主义法律，希特勒用他的血腥恐怖。正如他们已经倒下去一样，凡是竭力摧残马克思主义，摧残关于工人阶级胜利的学说和德国共产党（李卜克内西、卢森堡和台尔曼的党）的人，也会遭到失败。
    德国共产党将存在下去，在阿登纳时代结束很久以后，它还将站在工人阶级和人民的最前列。德国共产党始终是在斗争中成长的。它也将在这场斗争中加强它本身的力量。那些在今天判决共产党人的人，在明天将受到人民的判决。
    现在，同志们和朋友们，投入新的斗争！不让那些要使德国没有和平的人得到和平！不让绞杀和平和民主的人得到自由！不让那些要搞乱我们孩子的安静、我们母亲的睡眠和我国人民生活的人得到安静！
    愿我们亲爱的德意志国家的人民得到和平、自由和进步！同德国共产党一起反对军国主义和反动势力，争取民主和社会主义！人民同我们在一起，胜利一定是属于我们的。
            德国共产党中央委员会
        1956年8月17日于杜塞尔多夫
