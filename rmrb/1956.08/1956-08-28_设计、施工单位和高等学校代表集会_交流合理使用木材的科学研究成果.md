Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. Representatives from sixty-one design, construction units, and universities in Beijing held an experience exchange meeting on the rational use of wood in design on the 24th and 25th. At the meeting, the Building Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Comprehensive Chemical Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry presented eight special technical reports, including "Research on Glued I-Beams" and "Application of Flitch Beams."

The special report on the physical and mechanical properties test of Picea jezoensis spruce, presented by the Building Research Institute, aroused everyone's attention. This institute spent more than half a year conducting over eight thousand tests and discovered that the strength of this type of wood, Picea jezoensis, had been underestimated by 10% in the past. This discovery will save one-tenth of the wood in structural design in the future. Conducting systematic physical and mechanical properties tests on wood is the first time this has been done nationwide. In the past, due to the lack of basic data on domestic wood, designers used estimation methods when calculating the strength of wood. At the meeting, everyone agreed that scientific research in this area should be strengthened in the future.

People were very interested in the round arch large roof truss with a span of 24 meters, which was successfully trial-produced by the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and the Building Research Institute using small pieces of wood glued together. This type of large roof truss can be made from second-class wood. Compared with the commonly used roof trusses of the same span, it can save half the wood. The glue used to glue this roof truss is the casein cement glue successfully developed by the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Technicians have conducted quality identification tests on the quality of this glue, and the bonding performance is very good. The cost of this glue is very cheap, less than one yuan per kilogram. Gluing a roof truss with a span of 24 meters only costs 25.4 yuan.

    设计、施工单位和高等学校代表集会
    交流合理使用木材的科学研究成果
    新华社26日讯　北京的六十一个设计、施工单位和高等学校的代表，在24日和25日，举行了在设计中合理使用木材的经验交流会。会上，建筑工程部建筑科学研究院、中国科学院土木建筑研究所、化学工业部综合化工研究所三个单位，提出了“胶合工字梁的研究”、“板梢梁的应用”等八个专题技术报告。
    建筑科学研究院提出的鱼鳞云杉物理力学性质试验的专题报告，引起了大家的重视。这个研究院用半年多的时间，作了八千多次试验，才发现过去对鱼鳞云杉这种木材的强度低估了10％。这个发现，使今后在结构设计中能节约十分之一的木材。对木材进行系统的物理力学性质试验，在全国还是第一次。过去，因为国产木材都缺乏基本资料，所以设计人员在计算木材强度的时候，都是采用估计的方法。会上，大家认为今后要加强这方面的科学研究。
    人们对土木建筑研究所和建筑科学研究院试制成功的用小木料胶拼成的跨度二十四公尺的圆拱型大屋架，感到很大兴趣。这种大屋架可以利用二等木料制成。它和目前常用的同跨度屋架比较，可以节省一半木材。胶拼这种屋架的胶水，是土木建筑研究所调制成功的酪素水泥胶。技术人员对这种胶的质量做过鉴定试验，胶结的性能很好。这种胶的成本很便宜，每公斤不到一元。胶拼一个二十四公尺跨度的屋架，只要二十五元四角。
