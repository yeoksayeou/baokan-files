    Baotou-Baiyun Ebo Railway Under Construction
    The Baotou-Baiyun Ebo Railway, built to support the construction of Baotou Steel, is being accelerated. In order to put Baotou Steel into production as soon as possible, the employees of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who are building the Baotou-Baiyun Ebo Railway, have launched a socialist production competition. The workers said: We will resolutely deliver the Baotou-Baiyun Ebo Railway to the state for use by the end of this year. This is a tractor fleet fighting on the Baotou-Baiyun Ebo line.

    建设中的包白铁路
    支援包钢建设的包头——白云鄂博铁路，正在加速进行建设。为了早日使包钢投入生产，修建包白铁路线的铁道部第三工程局职工展开了社会主义生产竞赛，工人们说：坚决把包白铁路在今年年底交付国家使用。这是战斗在包白线上的拖拉机群。　　　　铁道部第三工程局铁道工程报　苏振山摄
