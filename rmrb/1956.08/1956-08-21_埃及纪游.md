An Egyptian Travelogue

(VIII) Now is the Time for a Real Celebration

    In the center of Cairo stands a Roman-style building. In front of the gate are two fountains, spraying cool water in the sunlight. This is the Egyptian National Opera House. The theater was built in 1869, which is a tragic story.

    From 1859 to 1869, the Egyptian Ismail dynasty contracted foreign debts and levied forced labor internally to dig the Suez Canal. Hundreds of thousands of farmers toiled for ten years, and 120,000 skeletons were left on both sides of the canal. In November 1869, the king incurred more foreign debt to celebrate the completion of the Suez Canal and held a grand banquet for guests. This National Opera House was built to celebrate the completion of the Suez Canal. On a night in November of that year, the King of Egypt invited emperors and queens from France, Austria, Sweden, and other countries to watch a play at the theater. Dignitaries from European countries, along with their noble ladies and famous actors, all arrived. However, before long, the Suez Canal was seized by imperialists and further used as a suction pipe to plunder Egyptian wealth.

    But now, the sound of foreign soldiers' boots in the Suez Canal Zone is no longer heard, the flag of the British Empire has been lowered over the Suez Canal, and the Suez Canal Company has been nationalized by the government of the Republic of Egypt.

    From 1869, the Egyptians struggled for nearly a century and waited for nearly a century. Now is the time for a real celebration.

    When we were in Cairo, we heard that this National Opera House had not staged Egyptian folk songs and dances for a long time. During the period of the Egyptian feudal dynasty, needless to say, the court looked down on Egyptian folk songs and dances, and the emperors indulged in "Western civilization." Due to the long-term influence of colonialism, today, the Egyptian literary and art circles have not yet clearly found the direction for developing Egyptian song and dance art. In this regard, two opinions exist. One is to take the Western road and learn ballet, and the other is to excavate Egypt's artistic heritage and take the road of developing national art. The Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation performed continuously at the Egyptian National Opera House and was warmly welcomed by the Egyptians. People said that the development of Chinese national culture and art provided a direction for the development of Egyptian art. Egyptian Minister of State Guidance, Radwan, said: "After some time, when you come again, you will definitely discover our achievements in developing national song and dance."

    In Cairo, we heard the singing of the famous Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, who is famous throughout the Arab East. In this National Opera House, the Egyptian government specially gathered famous artists from all over the country to hold an Egyptian song and dance performance evening to welcome the visit of the Chinese artists. This was a very interesting evening. Dances like "A Day in the Countryside," which describes the life of farmers, and Egyptian dances like "A Desert Feast," which are full of poetic sentiment and strong life atmosphere, left us with a deep impression. For a long time, the Egyptian dances that appeared on the stage of the Egyptian National Opera House still lingered in my mind.

    埃及纪游
    冯之丹
    （八）现在是真正庆祝的时候了
    在开罗的市中心，矗立着一座罗马式的建筑物。大门前有两个喷泉，在阳光中喷射着清凉的水花。这是埃及国家歌剧院。剧院建于1869年，这是一个悲剧的故事。
    1859年到1869年，埃及伊斯迈皇朝外举国债，内征民役，开凿苏彝士运河。数十万农民进行了十年苦役，十二万付白骨被抛在运河的两岸。1869年11月，国王为庆祝苏彝士运河的凿成又举外债，大宴宾客。这个国家歌剧院就是为庆祝苏彝士运河的凿成而建立的。这一年十一月间的一个夜晚，埃及国王邀请了法国、奥地利和瑞典等国的皇帝及皇后到剧院观剧，欧洲各国的显贵带着他们的贵夫人和著名演员都到了这里。然而，曾几何时，苏彝士运河被帝国主义攫夺了，甚至进一步被帝国主义利用来作为掠夺埃及财富的吸血管。
    可是，现在，苏彝士运河区的外国士兵的皮靴声不再响了，苏彝士运河上空的大英帝国的国旗降下了，苏彝士运河公司已经被埃及共和国政府收归国有了。
    从1869年起，埃及人斗争了将近一个世纪，等待了将近一个世纪，现在才是真正庆祝的时候了。
    我们在开罗的时候听人说，这个国家歌剧院很久以来未曾演出过埃及自己的民族歌舞。在埃及封建皇朝时期，不用说，宫廷是轻视埃及自己的民间歌舞的，帝王们沉迷于“西方文明”。由于殖民主义的长期统治的影响，今天埃及的文艺界还不能很明确地找到发展埃及歌舞艺术的方向。在这方面，两种意见都存在，一种意见是走西方的道路，学芭蕾，另一种意见是要挖掘埃及的艺术遗产，走发展民族艺术的道路。中国文化艺术代表团在埃及国家歌剧院进行了连续的演出，受到了埃及人的热烈欢迎。人们说，中国民族文化艺术的发展给埃及的艺术提供了发展的方向。埃及政府国家指导部长拉德温这样说：“再过些时候，当你们再来的时候，你们一定会发现我们在发展民族歌舞方面的成就。”
    我们在开罗，听到过埃及著名的名歌演唱家奥木·克鲁松的歌声，她是整个阿拉伯东方都闻名的。就在这个国家歌剧院，埃及政府为了欢迎中国的艺术家们的访问，还特地集中了全国著名的艺术家，为我们举行了一次埃及歌舞的表演晚会。这是一个很有兴趣的晚会。像描写农民生活的舞蹈“乡村的一日”，像富于诗的情调和浓厚的生活气息的埃及舞“沙漠的祝宴”等等给了我们很深刻的印象。长久，长久，埃及国家歌剧院的舞台上出现的埃及舞还萦绕在我的脑际。
