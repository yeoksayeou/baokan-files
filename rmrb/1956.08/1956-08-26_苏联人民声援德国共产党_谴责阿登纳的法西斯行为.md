    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, August 25th: The Soviet people have been continuously publishing articles and giving talks in newspapers and on the radio in recent days, angrily condemning the West German authorities' fascist actions of banning and persecuting the German Communist Party.
    A veteran Communist Party member, Petrovsky, exposed Adenauer's deceptive tricks in "Soviet Russia Newspaper." He wrote that when Adenauer was in Moscow last year, he deliberately distanced himself from the Hitler fascists, and said that he would personally strangle the remnants of Hitler who brought endless suffering to the German people, but now it proves that Adenauer is following Hitler's old path.
    The Soviet poet Tikhonov said: "History will not repeat itself. Although some people yearn for the road of 'Mein Kampf,' they will not be able to follow it... In today's world, there is enough power to block the reactionary forces from taking the road to new fascism. This peace-loving force exists all over the world, including West Germany. They deeply understand that the German Communist Party cannot be eliminated, just as the German people will not be eliminated."
    Mikhailov, a steelworker in Moscow, said: Communism cannot be banned, just as the struggle for peace and the vital interests of the people cannot be banned, and the German working people cannot be banned from speaking and breathing.
    The Soviet people give proletarian internationalist support to the German comrades for the new difficulties brought about by the West German authorities' barbaric suppression. Dubinin, a worker at the "Red Viborg District" factory in Leningrad, representing the workers of Leningrad, said to the comrades of the German Communist Party: Our German friends, we stand with you. The Soviet people are convinced that truth and justice will surely triumph in your German land.

    苏联人民声援德国共产党
    谴责阿登纳的法西斯行为
    本报莫斯科25日电　苏联人民连日以来不断在报纸上和广播中发表文章和谈话，愤怒谴责西德当局禁止和迫害德共的法西斯行为。
    一个党龄很老的苏共党员彼得罗夫斯基在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上揭穿阿登纳的骗人花招。他写道，阿登纳去年在莫斯科的时候，特地把自己和希特勒法西斯划清界限，并说什么他要亲手把给德国人民带来无穷苦难的希特勒的余孽扼死，但现在证明阿登纳是在走着希特勒的老路。
    苏联诗人吉洪诺夫说：“历史是不会重演的。虽然有人向往‘我的奋斗’的道路，但却是走不上去了，……在今天的世界上，有着足够的力量可以堵塞反动势力走向新的法西斯主义的道路。这种爱好和平的力量遍及全世界，也包括西德在内。他们深刻地懂得，德国共产党是消灭不了的，正像德国人民不会被消灭一样。”
    莫斯科的炼钢工人米哈伊洛夫说：共产党是禁止不了的，正像禁止不了为和平、为人民切身利益的斗争，禁止不了德国劳动人民讲话和呼吸一样。
    苏联人民对德国同志因西德当局的横蛮镇压而带来的新的困难给以无产阶级国际主义的声援。列宁格勒“红色维堡区”工厂工人杜必宁代表列宁格勒的工人向德国共产党的同志说：我们的德国朋友们，我们同你们站在一起。苏联人民确信，在你们德国的土地上，真理和正义一定会胜利。
