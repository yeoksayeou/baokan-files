    Zhejiang Province Holds Second Party Congress
    (Our reporter Liu Fan reports from Hangzhou) The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province was held in Hangzhou from July 1st to 30th. 849 delegates attended the congress, representing more than 190,000 Communist Party members in the province.

    The congress fully promoted democracy and unfolded criticism and self-criticism. 111 delegates made oral and written speeches at the congress. The delegates criticized the lack of self-criticism in the draft work report of the previous provincial party committee and put forward suggestions. The enlarged meeting of the provincial party committee revised the work report based on the opinions put forward by the delegates.

    The congress believed that since the liberation of Zhejiang Province, all aspects of work have greatly developed. The total agricultural output value in 1955 was 166% of that in 1949, and the output of grain, cotton, and hemp exceeded the highest annual output in history. The total industrial output value in 1955 was 304% of that in 1949, exceeding 236% of the highest annual total industrial output value of the province in 1936. Now, Zhejiang has basically realized the cooperativization of agriculture, fishery, and salt industry, and has achieved a victory in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry, commerce, and handicrafts. These have paved the way for the socialist construction of Zhejiang Province in the future.

    The delegates also pointed out that after the country entered the planned economic and cultural construction, the provincial party committee's leadership failed to make comprehensive arrangements and take care of all aspects of work in a timely manner according to the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. For example, for a long time, although the provincial party committee grasped agriculture tightly, it neglected the leadership of industrial production, and even put forward the erroneous slogan of "agriculture driving everything" in 1954, placing coastal local industry in a subordinate position, which greatly affected the development of industrial production. In agriculture, the congress particularly criticized the erroneous policy of "resolutely shrinking" that was once adopted on the issue of agricultural cooperativization; under the guidance of this erroneous policy, 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives were shrunk, which seriously挫伤打击 the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. In agricultural production, the provincial party committee once simply focused on grain production, while neglecting the leadership of other cash crops and sideline production. Therefore, in recent years, except for the relatively rapid development of grain, cotton, and hemp production, the output of other crops such as silkworm cocoons, tea, and oranges has not recovered to the highest level before the Anti-Japanese War. Although grain production has increased in some areas, the total income of farmers has decreased, which not only affected social supply and the state's export plan, but also directly affected the relationship between the party and farmers.

    The delegates sharply criticized the subjective, bureaucratic, and commandist shortcomings and mistakes of the previous provincial party committee's leadership. The delegates believed that in recent years, due to the provincial party committee's lack of systematic investigation and research on specific situations, insufficient repeated consultation with lower-level organizations when determining certain major policies, tasks, and plans, and overly rigid regulations, some policies and tasks were not in line with actual situations. In the process of implementation, they did not humbly listen to the feedback and opinions of cadres and the masses to consider revisions, and even exerted pressure to forcibly implement them. The delegates criticized the provincial party committee's lack of democratic style, unsound collective leadership, and the problems of certain responsible comrades of the provincial party committee being strict with others, lenient with themselves, and粗暴 brutal.

    The congress pointed out that the emergence of these shortcomings and mistakes was due to the rather serious complacency in the leadership of the provincial party committee. They did not accept the historical lessons of Zhejiang Province's work and lacked a democratic, equal, and consultative attitude towards lower levels. Therefore, criticism from below was restricted, and criticism could not be expressed freely.

    The congress pointed out that in order to effectively overcome these shortcomings and mistakes, it is required that from the next provincial party committee onwards, party committees at all levels should establish a systematic investigation and research work system. The provincial party committee must deeply engage in actual practice and humbly consult with leading cadres at all levels, grassroots cadres, and the masses on the decisions of major issues. The agenda of the provincial party committee meetings and the standing committee meetings of the provincial party committee should not only discuss the central government's instructions, but also have more time to discuss major issues raised in real life. The provincial party committee and provincial-level organs should cultivate the ability to think independently and the spirit of boldness and responsibility in strengthening the research of actual work.

    The presidium of the congress actively supported the delegates' criticisms. The responsible comrades of the previous provincial party committee made a relatively profound self-criticism at the meeting, and the delegates present unanimously expressed their satisfaction.

    The congress elected the new provincial party committee members and delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Before the election, the delegates repeatedly discussed and reviewed the list of candidates, strictly criticized some candidates with shortcomings, and suggested that the presidium replace individual candidates; some members of the previous provincial party committee failed to be re-elected in this election.

    The congress finally passed a resolution and unanimously agreed to the supplemented work report of the previous provincial party committee.

    浙江省召开第二次党代表大会
    本报记者刘凡报道　中国共产党浙江省第二次代表大会于七月一日到三十日在杭州举行。出席大会的有849名代表，代表全省十九万多共产党员。
    大会充分地发扬了民主，展开了批评与自我批评。有111名代表在大会上作了口头和书面发言。代表们对前届省委工作报告（草案）缺乏自我批评的地方进行了批评和提出了建议，省委扩大会议根据代表们提出的意见对工作报告作了修改。
    代表大会认为，浙江省解放以来，各项工作都有很大发展。1955年农业总产值为1949年的166％，其中粮食、棉花、麻产量都超过历史上最高年度产量。1955年的工业总产值为1949年的304％，超过1936年最高年度全省工业总产值的236％。现在，浙江已基本上实现了农业、渔业、盐业的合作化，取得了对于资本主义工商业和手工业社会主义改造的胜利。这些给今后浙江省社会主义建设铺平了道路。
    代表们同时指出，在国家进入有计划的经济建设和文化建设以后，省委领导上没能及时根据国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，对各项工作加以全面的安排和照顾。比如长期以来，省委虽抓紧了农业，但忽略了对工业生产的领导，甚至在1954年提出了“农业带动一切”的错误口号，把沿海地方工业放在从属的地位，大大地影响工业生产的发展。在农业方面，大会特别批判了对农业合作化问题曾经采取的“坚决收缩”的错误方针；在这个错误方针指导下，一万五千个农业生产合作社被收缩掉，严重挫伤了干部和群众的社会主义积极性。在农业生产上，省委又曾单纯地抓紧粮食生产，而忽视对其他经济作物和副业生产的领导。因此，几年来，除粮食、棉、麻生产发展较快以外，其他蚕茧、茶、桔等作物产量都没有恢复到抗战前的最高水平。虽然有些地区粮食增加了，但是农民总收入却减少了，这样不仅影响了社会供应和国家出口计划，而且直接影响了党和农民的关系。
    大会代表尖锐地批评了前届省委领导上的主观主义、官僚主义、命令主义等缺点和错误。代表们认为，几年来省委由于对具体情况缺乏系统的调查研究、在确定某些重大方针、任务和计划的时候，和下级组织反复商量不够，规定过死，因而有些方针任务是不切合实际情况的，在执行中，又不虚心听取干部和群众反映的情况和意见，来考虑修改，甚至施加压力，强行贯彻。代表们对省委的民主作风不够，集体领导不健全，以及对某些省委负责同志的责人严、责己宽和粗暴等毛病提出了批评。
    大会指出，这些缺点和错误的产生，是由于省委领导上存在着相当严重的骄傲自满情绪，没有接受浙江省工作中的历史教训，对下级缺乏民主的、平等的、商量的态度，因此自下而上的批评受到限制，批评不能做到畅所欲言。
    大会指出，为了切实有效地克服这些缺点和错误，要求从下届省委开始，各级党委要建立系统的调查研究工作，省委对于重大问题的决定，必须深入实际虚心地同各级领导干部、基层干部和群众商量；省委会议和省委常委会议的议事日程中，不仅要讨论中央指示，而且要有更多的时间来讨论实际生活中提出的重大问题；省委会和省级机关要在加强实际工作的研究中培养独立思考的能力和大胆负责的精神。
    大会主席团积极支持了代表的批评，前届省委负责同志在会上作了比较深刻的检讨，到会代表一致表示满意。
    大会选出了新的省委委员和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表。选举前，代表们对候选人名单进行了反复的讨论和审查，对某些有缺点的候选人进行了严格的批评，并建议主席团调换了个别候选人；上届省委委员，有的在这次选举中落选。
    大会最后通过决议，并且一致同意补充后的上届省委工作报告。
