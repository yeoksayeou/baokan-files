Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd, Bangkok News: According to newspaper reports, Thai Army Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Defense Minister Nai Sarit stated in Parliament on August 16th, in response to questions from parliamentarians, that by the end of June this year, Thailand's expenditures in the Korean War (excluding army salaries) had reached a total of 229 million Thai baht.

Nai Sarit made the above remarks in response to questions raised by Nai Chen·Pulibo, the deputy leader of the Thai Economic Person Party and a member of parliament. He also revealed that a total of 119 Thai soldiers died in the Korean War, with 5 others missing and 10 injured and disabled. Currently, there is still one battalion of Thai troops (251 army personnel and 34 air force personnel) stationed in South Korea.

Nai Chen questioned what benefits Thailand had gained from sending troops to participate in the Korean War. By what right does the United States demand that Thailand repay the 2 billion baht debt incurred in the war? Is the United States' purpose in demanding debt repayment from Thailand to pressure Thailand to change its diplomatic stance on trade with China?

Nai Chen pointed out that the United States is trying its best to praise Thailand's participation in the Korean War as a heroic act, with the aim of exploiting Thailand in the future. He also pointed out that the United States' dispatch of soldiers and arms aid to Thailand contains the intention of occupying and binding Thailand.

    泰国参加侵朝战争吃大亏
    议员乃琛指责政府上了美国的当
    付出了重大代价还要被追索债款
    新华社23日讯　曼谷消息：据报纸报道，泰国陆军总司令兼副国防部长乃沙立八月十六日在议会上答复议员的质问时说，到今年六月底为止，泰国在朝鲜战争中支出的费用（不包括军队的薪水）已经共达泰币二亿二千九百多万铢。
    乃沙立是在答复泰经济人党副领袖、议员乃琛·莆里博提出的质问时发表上述谈话的。他还透露，泰国军队在朝鲜战争中共有一百一十九人死亡，另失踪五人，受伤残废的十人。目前还有一营泰国军队（陆军二百五十一人，空军三十四人）留在南朝鲜。
    乃琛提出质问说，泰国派遣军队参加朝鲜战争究竟得到什么益处？美国根据什么权利要泰国偿还在战争中所欠的二十亿铢债款？美国向泰国索债的目的是不是在压迫泰国改变同中国进行贸易的外交立场？
    乃琛指出，美国竭力称颂泰国参加朝鲜战争为英雄行为，其目的是希望在将来利用泰国。他还指出，美国派遣军人和以武器援助泰国，含有占领和束缚泰国的企图。
