Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th - The Jing-Shan and Jin-Pu Railways are currently threatened by flooding due to the convergence of five rivers in North China near Tianjin. All stations under the Tianjin Railway Bureau have established flood prevention headquarters, protection teams, or protection groups, organizing nearly three thousand employees into flood prevention teams. Each bridge has dedicated personnel to monitor water levels, and the tracks are patrolled day and night. All stations have prepared ample flood prevention materials and tools, and some have even set up dedicated trains already equipped with flood prevention materials. At the same time, they have contacted governments at all levels and agricultural production cooperatives along the lines, so that a large number of laborers can be mobilized for emergency rescue if necessary.
