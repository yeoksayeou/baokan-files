Xinhua News Agency, London, August 17th: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who is attending the London conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue, stated that Japan does not approve of using force to coerce Egypt. He emphasized that the Suez Canal issue should be resolved through peaceful means and believes that respecting Egypt's rights as a sovereign state is appropriate.

Shigemitsu made the above statement regarding Japan's basic policy on the Suez Canal issue at a press conference held last night. He stressed that Japan is very concerned about ensuring the principle of freedom of navigation.

Shigemitsu also said that the London conference contains very delicate issues, and Japan's position between the Asian-African group and Western countries is complex. Japan will carefully observe the proceedings of the conference and deal with it cautiously.

Shigemitsu also revealed that during the London conference, he will hold talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov at some point. The two were the heads of their respective delegations in the recently interrupted Soviet-Japanese negotiations in Moscow.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has told Shigemitsu that they "must have a private meeting" during their stay in London.

    强调尊重埃及主权和平解决运河问题
    新华社17日讯　伦敦消息：在伦敦参加讨论苏彝士运河问题会议的日本外务相重光说，日本不赞成用武力压迫埃及的想法。他强调苏彝士运河问题应该通过和平方法解决，并且认为尊重埃及作为主权国家所应有的权利是妥当的。
    重光在昨天晚间举行记者招待会，说明了日本对苏彝士运河问题的上述基本方针。他强调说明日本对确实保证自由航行的原则一事非常关心。
    重光还说，伦敦会议包含着非常微妙的问题，处于亚非集团和西方国家之间的日本的处境是复杂的。日本要好好地观察会议的进行情况，慎重地加以应付。
    重光并且透露，在伦敦会议期间，他将在某个时候同苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫进行一次会谈。他们两人是最近在莫斯科中断的苏日谈判的双方代表团团长。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯已经告诉重光说，他们在伦敦逗留期间，“必须进行一次私下会谈”。
