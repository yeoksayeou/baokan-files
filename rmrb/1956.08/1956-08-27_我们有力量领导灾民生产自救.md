Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 26th: The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee jointly issued "Instructions on Strengthening Production and Disaster Relief Work" on the 23rd.

This summer, Heilongjiang Province has experienced continuous heavy rainfall, causing a general surge in the water levels of all major and minor rivers. The main stream of the Songhua River experienced the largest recorded flood peak, resulting in over 600,000 hectares of farmland and more than 600 villages across the province being affected by floods. The instructions require all localities to promptly and properly resettle disaster victims and provide necessary relief. At the same time, within the agricultural cooperatives, mutual assistance among members should be promoted, and people in non-disaster areas should be mobilized to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and actively support the people in disaster areas. Ensure that every disaster victim promptly receives shelter and, with the active organization of disaster victims' self-help through production and government assistance, ensure that every disaster victim has enough to eat and warm clothes. The instructions emphasize the need to actively carry out self-help through production to ensure that disaster victims rebuild their homes as soon as possible. Farmland that can be salvaged should be quickly organized for rescue. Farmland that has not been affected or has been lightly affected should strengthen field management, strive to increase production and ensure harvests, and try to increase yields as much as possible. Farmland that is no longer possible to harvest should be drained in a timely manner to facilitate spring plowing next year. Based on the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat from the mountains, and relying on the water to eat from the water," vigorously organize and lead disaster victims to develop diversified production according to local conditions. In order to do a good job in self-help through production, it is necessary to rely closely on the organizational strength of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Because after the disaster, the disaster victims need to quickly carry out self-help through production, and also need to seize the time to build houses, and need to drain water and remove soil as soon as possible. In the case of many tasks, tight schedules, and many difficulties, it is particularly necessary to unite and cooperate, pool the wisdom of the masses, and give full play to the organizational role of cooperatives. Therefore, all rural disaster areas should emphasize collective production by cooperative as the unit.

The instructions pointed out that this year is the first year of agricultural cooperation, and it is very distressing to suffer serious natural disasters just when a bumper harvest is in sight. However, we have the strength to lead the people in disaster areas to help themselves through production, tide over the current famine, and rebuild their homes. It is hoped that all cooperative members will further promote the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" in the face of disaster. Every Communist Party member and Communist Youth League member in the disaster area should become a model for uniting all cooperative members and carrying out self-help through production together.

The instructions finally stated that party and government leading organs at all levels must specifically investigate the actual situation of disasters in their areas, specifically formulate plans for self-help through production, send personnel to the disaster areas, and specifically lead disaster victims to carry out self-help through production.

Yilan County Sets Out a Production Self-Help Plan
Disaster Victims' Income in Autumn and Winter Can Reach 1.5 to 1.6 Million Yuan
Xinhua News Agency, Yilan, August 26th: Farmers in Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, downstream of the Songhua River, who have suffered from floods, have now launched self-help activities through production.

The self-help production activities of more than 20 agricultural cooperatives in Tuchengzi District, the suburbs of Yilan Town, and Yinglan District, which were severely affected by the disaster, have formed a mass movement. At present, cooperative members are taking measures such as breaking ridges to divert water and digging pits to bail water in the fields every day to drain waterlogging; they are carrying out production increase and harvest protection work such as weeding and ditching on unflooded fields; and some people are entering the mountains to collect ginseng, hunt, collect mountain products, and engage in forestry production. One hundred and thirty-three people collecting ginseng in Tuchengzi District have already dug up 40 ginseng seedlings, including 10 with four-compound leaves and one with five-compound leaves, worth more than 3,000 yuan.

The self-help production activities of farmers in the disaster area of ​​this county were launched after the Yilan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county's economic departments jointly studied and formulated a self-help production plan for the autumn and winter seasons. According to the county's plan, the disaster-stricken farmers in the county can earn more than 563,000 yuan from increasing production and protecting harvests and sideline production before the autumn harvest alone. Coupled with winter harvesting and transportation, they can earn about 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. This can basically make up for the loss of flooded farmland, and the income of cooperative members is still guaranteed.

The 12,000 hectares of farmland flooded in Yilan County this time included approximately 6,000 hectares with no harvest at all, and the rest had varying degrees of harvest. The production morale of the disaster-stricken farmers once fluctuated. The Yilan County Committee of the Communist Party of China began to pay attention to self-help through production when the flood situation eased slightly. They implemented the method of education, resettlement, and production simultaneously in the disaster area, helping returning farmers rebuild their homes and helping them launch movements to rescue farmland and develop sideline production according to local conditions.

In the Hard Days of Fighting the Largest Flood in the Songhua River
Nearly 100,000 Cadres in Hebei Province Persist in the Struggle
Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 26th: Nearly 100,000 cadres in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei Province have displayed an indomitable spirit in leading the masses to fight the floods.

Cadres of party and government organs at all levels commanded flood prevention teams and fought floods day and night, and rushed to the scene to guide dike repair, flood control, damming work, and rescue of disaster victims. During the most tense times of the water situation in various rivers, Baoding Prefecture had more than 7,000 cadres leading more than 300,000 laborers to the dikes for rescue and reinforcement, and 11 members of the prefectural committee went to various places to direct the work in person. When Song Lian, deputy secretary of the prefectural committee, was directing the flood prevention and rescue of the Zhulong River, a strong storm broke the power lines and lost the tools for commanding the battle, so he ran more than ten miles in the dark and rain carrying the telephone to Suning County to borrow the line and continue commanding. Ping ?, deputy secretary of the Youth League Committee of Dingxing County, swam five miles in the dark to Daliu Village to rescue disaster victims. More than 1,700 disaster victims, 74 livestock, and 40,000 catties of grain in Daliu Village were rescued from danger under the day and night protection of these selfless cadres.

More than 30,000 cadres from economic and enterprise departments in the disaster areas of the province also actively participated in the rescue struggle. In addition to actively rescuing and protecting state property, they tried every means to overcome the difficulties of muddy roads and floods that prevented operations, and promptly supplied the disaster areas with what they needed. According to statistics from some counties in Baoding Prefecture, they carried or transported more than one million catties of grain and many daily necessities to the farmers.

In order to ensure the health of the disaster victims, a large number of medical personnel from state-run hospitals and joint clinics throughout the province went to the disaster areas to treat the disaster victims. A medical team of more than 5,000 people composed of thirteen counties including Zhuoxian and Dingxing worked day and night on the thousand-mile dike to treat migrant workers and disaster victims, so that more than 1,500 patients received timely treatment.

Fighting the Largest Flood in the Songhua River
The People of Harbin Achieve Victory
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 26th: At 3:00 PM today, the water level of the river in Harbin City was 118.79 meters, 1 centimeter lower than the warning water level, and the water level is still continuing to fall. At this point, Harbin City has been relieved of the threat of flooding.

The Harbin Flood Control Headquarters has issued a notice lifting the order to control vehicles and flood prevention materials. All units in the city are conducting an evaluation of meritorious personnel in the flood control struggle.

    我们有力量领导灾民生产自救
    黑龙江省发布加强救灾工作指示
    要求发挥农业社的组织作用
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电　中共黑龙江省委员会、黑龙江省人民委员会在23日联合发布“关于加强生产救灾工作的指示”。
    黑龙江省今年夏季连降大雨，各大小江河水位普遍猛涨，松花江干流洪峰连续出现了有记载以来的最大洪水，致使全省有六十多万公顷农田和六百多个村屯遭受水灾。指示要求各地及时妥善地安置灾民，给予必要的救济。同时在社内，提倡社员互助互济，发动非灾区人民发扬互助友爱精神，踊跃支援灾区人民。保证每个灾民及时得到住处，以及在积极组织灾民生产自救和政府扶助下做到每个灾民吃饱、穿暖。指示强调要积极地开展生产自救，保证灾民早日重建家园。凡是能够抢救的农田，应迅速组织群众进行抢救。没有受灾或受灾不重的农田，应加强田间管理，努力做好增产保收，尽量争取增加收成。已经不可能有收成的农田，应及时进行排水，以利明年春耕。本着“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”的原则，大力组织和领导灾民因地制宜发展副业生产。为了搞好生产自救的工作，必须紧紧依靠农业生产合作社的组织力量。由于受灾之后，灾民既需要迅速开展生产自救，又需要争取时间修建房屋，并需要及早排水脱地。在活计多、时间紧、困难多的情况下，特别需要团结合作，群策群力，发挥合作社的组织作用。因此，一切农村灾区，均应强调以社为单位，集体生产。
    指示指出，今年是农业合作化的第一年，而且正当丰收在望的时候，遭受严重的自然灾害是很痛心的。但是，我们有力量领导受灾人民生产自救，度过目前的灾荒，并且重新建立家园。希望所有社员在受灾困难的情况下更加发扬“同舟共济”的精神。灾区每个共产党员、青年团员应当成为团结全体社员、共同进行生产自救的模范。
    指示最后说，各级党、政领导机关必须具体调查本地区的灾害实际情况，具体制定生产自救的计划，抽调力量深入灾区，具体领导灾民进行生产自救。
    依兰县定出生产自救方案
    秋冬两季灾民收入可达一百五六十万元
    新华社依兰26日电　松花江下游黑龙江省依兰县遭受水灾的农民目前已经展开生产自救的活动。
    受灾严重的土城子区、依兰镇郊区和迎兰区的二十多个农业社的生产自救活动，已经形成群众性的运动。目前，社员们每天都在农田里采取破垅顺水，挖坑挑水的办法进行排涝；在没有被淹的田里进行拿大草、放秋垅等增产保收工作，还有一些人入山采参、打猎、采山货和从事林业生产。土城子区采参的一百三十三个人，已挖得山参四十苗，其中有四品叶的十苗，还有一个五品叶的。价值在三千元以上。
    这个县灾区农民的生产自救活动，是在中共依兰县委员会和县内各经济部门共同研究订出了秋冬两季的生产自救方案以后展开的。根据县的计划，全县受灾农民，光是在秋收前的增产保收和副业生产中就可收入五十六万三千多元，再加上冬季采伐和运输，大约可以收入到一百五六十万元。这样就基本上可以弥补农田被淹的损失，社员 的收入仍有保证。
    依兰县这次洪水被淹的一万二千公顷农田，其中颗粒不收的大约有六千公顷，其余还有程度不同的收成。受灾农民的生产情绪曾一度波动。中共依兰县委在水情稍趋缓和的时候，就开始注意生产自救工作。他们在灾区实行边教育、边安置、边生产的办法，帮助回乡的农民重建家园，并且帮助他们因地制宜地展开抢救农田和开展副业生产运动。
    在同洪水搏斗的艰苦日子里
    河北省近十万干部坚持斗争
    据新华社保定26日电　河北省水灾地区近十万名干部，在领导群众与洪水搏斗中发挥了百折不挠的精神。
    各级党政机关干部，夜以继日地指挥防汛队伍和洪水战斗，并赶到现场指导修堤抗险、堵口工作和抢救灾民。在各河水情最紧张的时候，保定专区曾有七千余名干部带领三十多万民工上堤抢险，十一名地委委员分往各地亲自指挥。地委副书记宋琏在指挥潴龙河的防汛抢救时，大风暴雨折断了电线，失去了指挥战斗的工具，就在黑夜冒雨背着电话机跑步十多里赶到肃宁县城借线继续指挥。定兴县青年团团委副书记平?在黑夜浮水五里赶到大留村抢救灾民。大留村的一千七百多名灾民、七十四头牲口和四万斤粮食，就是在这些舍己为民的干部们日夜抢护下转危为安的。
    该省灾区经济企业部门三万多名干部也积极参加抢救斗争。除积极抢救、保护国家资财外，他们想尽各种办法克服道路泥泞和洪水过大不能运行的困难，及时供应了灾区所需要的东西。据保定专区部分县的统计，就有一百多万斤粮食和很多日用品，是他们或背或挑送到农民手里的。
    为了保证灾民的身体健康，全省许多国营医院与联合诊疗所的大批医务工作人员，分赴灾区为灾民治病。涿县、定兴等十三个县组成的五千多人的医疗队，日夜工作在千里堤上，为民工、灾民治病，使一千五百多个病人得到了及时治疗。
