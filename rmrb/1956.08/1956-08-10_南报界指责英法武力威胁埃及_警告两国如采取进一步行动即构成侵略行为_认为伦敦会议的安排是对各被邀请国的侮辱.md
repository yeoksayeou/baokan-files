Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the Yugoslav newspapers "Borba" and "Politika" published commentaries on the 9th, criticizing the military measures being taken by Britain and France regarding the Suez Canal issue.

The "Borba" commentator wrote that the Western countries, especially Britain and France, have turned the Suez Canal issue into an international crisis, causing unrest worldwide, and it is now up to them to eliminate this unrest.

"Borba" wrote that the policy of exerting military pressure on Egypt has already damaged the reputation of Britain and France because they have violated their obligations to the United Nations to resolve all disputes peacefully and to respect the equality of all nations. But if it turns out that they are prepared to take even further action, then they run the risk of being accused of aggression. The nineteenth century is over, and repeating the events of that century is bound to have dangerous consequences.

In discussing the freedom of international navigation on the Suez Canal, the "Borba" commentator emphasized that the Egyptian government has not only declared verbally but also demonstrated through practical actions that it is implementing this principle. The assurances of a member government of the United Nations must be respected.

"Borba" believes that the first step must be to restore the military machinery of Britain and France from its current operational state to its normal peacetime status. The only way to resolve this issue is through negotiations on equal terms for all parties. In this regard, the important point is to revise the decisions regarding the scope of the conference discussions and the membership of the conference. The Suez Canal issue should be discussed by the United Nations because the United Nations is the most appropriate body. This should be an international conference and therefore must be held under the auspices of the United Nations, and its participants should be decided according to objective criteria. The purpose of each international discussion on the Suez Canal issue must be decided, and this can only be a free and equal exchange of views, and the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company must not be "pre-emptively" cancelled.

The "Politika" commentator said: The decision to convene a conference on the Suez Canal in London while simultaneously taking military measures is inconsistent with the general trend of world events. It arbitrarily predetermined the agenda and pre-selected the members participating in the conference, thereby giving the convening countries a natural majority. This is somewhat insulting to Egypt and every other country that received an invitation. If a conference is convened solely by one party to a dispute, and if fifteen of the twenty-four countries invited are members of Western military treaties, this conference cannot be called an international conference. If there is truly a consensus that it is necessary to convene a conference, then the conference should be allowed to decide what will be discussed on the Suez Canal issue, and how the discussion should be conducted to ensure that it is truly free and does not infringe on the sovereignty of any nation.

    南报界指责英法武力威胁埃及
    警告两国如采取进一步行动即构成侵略行为
    认为伦敦会议的安排是对各被邀请国的侮辱
    据新华社9日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，南斯拉夫“战斗报”和“政治报”九日发表评论，指责英国和法国正在就苏彝士运河问题采取的军事措施。
    “战斗报”评论员写道，西方国家、特别是英国和法国把苏彝士运河问题变成了一个国际危机，引起了全世界的不安，现在是由它们来消除这种不安的时候了。
    “战斗报”写道，对埃及施加军事压力的政策，已经使英国和法国的名誉受到了损失，因为它们违反了它们向联合国承担的以和平方法解决一切争端和尊重各国平等的义务。但是如果事实居然证明，它们准备采取甚至更进一步的行动的话，那末它们就有被指责为侵略者的危险。十九世纪已经过去了，重复那个世纪所发生的事件是决不能不引起危险的后果的。
    “战斗报”评论员在谈到苏彝士运河的国际航行自由的时候着重指出，埃及政府不仅在口头宣布，而且以实际行动证明，它在执行这个原则。一个联合国会员国政府的保证必须得到尊重。
    “战斗报”认为，首先必须使英国和法国的在开动着的军事机器恢复它的正常的平时状态。解决这个问题的唯一办法就是在所有各方平等的条件下进行谈判。在这方面，重要之点就是修改关于会议讨论范围和会议成员的决定。苏彝士运河问题应该由联合国来加以讨论，因为联合国是最适当的机构。这应该是一个国际会议，因此务必在联合国的赞助下举行，它的参加者应该按照客观的标准来加以决定。必须决定每一次关于苏彝士运河问题的国际讨论的目的，这只能是一种自由平等的交换意见，决不能“预先”取消苏彝士运河公司的国有化。
    “政治报”的评论员说：伦敦会谈决定召开关于苏彝士运河的会议，同时采取了军事措施，这是不符合世界事态发展的总趋势的。它武断地先行决定了议程，并且事先决定了参加会议的成员，从而给予召开国以一个自然而然的多数。这对于埃及和接到了邀请的其他每一个国家都是带有些污辱性的。如果一个会议仅由争端的一方召集，如果被邀请的二十四个国家中有十五个国家是西方军事条约的成员，这个会议就不能称为国际会议。如果真正是大家一致认为有召开会议的必要，那就应该让会议去决定在苏彝士运河问题上将讨论些什么，以及应该怎样进行讨论才能使讨论真正自由和不侵犯任何一国的主权。
