The draft of the Twelve-Year Science Plan lists the history of China's national economy from 1840 to 1949 as an important issue in economics, stating that it "includes the history of the development of Chinese capitalism, the history of modern Chinese land issues and land system reform, and the economic history of revolutionary base areas during the democratic revolution." In the important issues of history, the history of China from 1840 to 1949 is also listed, and it is believed that it should "systematically and comprehensively explain the evolution of Chinese semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and summarize the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle during this historical period." These two important issues are interrelated, but it is worth noting that neither of these two important issues points out or emphasizes the history of imperialist economic aggression against China; and to study the history of China's national economy from 1840 to 1949, it is impossible not to involve the history of imperialist economic aggression against China. From the Opium War to the eve of China's liberation, it was a full hundred years. In these hundred years, it was the period when imperialism gradually carried out economic aggression against China, making China gradually become a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Although this period has passed, the forces of imperialism have not been completely eliminated; and the impact of economic aggression on our national economy is profound and enormous. It is not very far from this period now, and we should promptly collect, sort out, compile and publish the historical materials of imperialist economic aggression against China, and first lay the foundation for studying the history of China's modern national economy.

The work we do to organize the history of China's national economy from 1840 to 1949 is more important than organizing the history of any previous period. But precisely this department of history is a relatively weak link in modern Chinese history. Before liberation, although some progressive writers made some outline descriptions of the history of imperialist economic aggression, it was not deep enough and comprehensive enough. After liberation, the research work in this area has also progressed very slowly. Many materials and archives of imperialist economic aggression—such as customs, banks, the circulation of foreign currency, foreign debt, stock exchanges, commodity exchanges, railways, shipping, passenger post, warehouses, raw material acquisition, manufacturing, commodity dumping, etc.—have not been seriously collected and sorted out, let alone systematically and comprehensively described.

Originally, capitalism and imperialism had a complete system of economic aggression against China. They first controlled our customs, grasping the throat of our import and export trade. Under the control of imperialism, the customs had such great power that it used customs revenue to manipulate China's finances; it managed coastal and river channels, controlled lighthouses and navigation marks, and even managed port affairs. Under foreign management, the customs has a history of nearly one hundred years from the establishment of the Customs Tax Department in 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty) to the liberation of China in 1949, so it has particularly rich archives and materials. In addition to the customs import and export tax regulations, customs revenue statistics, import and export trade statistics, import commodity classifications, export commodity classifications, and domestic trade local commodity re-export statistics that have been published over the years, there are also many secret documents. From these secret documents, we can see the imperialist conspiracy to manipulate our country's finances and the tricks to carry out economic aggression and even political and military aggression against China. These statistics, reports, and confidential customs documents are very important for studying the history of China's modern national economy, but since liberation, they have not been systematically collected, sorted out, compiled, and published. I suggest that to study the economic aggression of capitalism and imperialism against China, we should first start with collecting and sorting out customs data.

Secondly, there is information about foreign banks. Originally, imperialist countries wanted to set up banks in China as a hub for manipulating finance and exporting capital, and then, when the time was right, further jointly manage China's finances. The first to be established was the British HSBC (established before 1877), followed by the French Banque de l'Indochine, the German Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, the Russian-Asian Bank, the American Citibank, the Belgian Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. At first, these banks competed with each other; finally, they united to monopolize the capital market. The Four-Power Banking Consortium (Britain, France, Germany, and the United States) was organized first (1911), and the Five-Power Banking Consortium (Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia) was established later (1913). Finally, under the manipulation and oppression of international monopoly capital, it signed the so-called "Post-War Grand Loan" with our country's then Beiyang warlord government. This post-war grand loan is a typical loan for economic aggression by imperialist monopoly capital. It not only uses customs revenue as collateral, but also designates salt tax as collateral; it not only controls customs, but also further controls salt affairs; it not only strictly restricts the use of loans, but also further supervises our country's finances (foreign auditors are set up in the audit office, and payment vouchers must be signed by them and checked by bank representatives before withdrawals can be made). These banks established in China by imperialist countries also destroyed and attacked Chinese national capitalists and national industries at any time and any place. For example, the illegal auction of Shenxin No. 7 Yarn Factory by HSBC in 1935 is a typical example. Some of the archives and materials of these imperialist banks have been formally taken over by our country (such as the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank and the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank), and some are still left in China, but have not been formally taken over (such as HSBC). If we want to study the economic aggression of capitalism and imperialism against China, we should also promptly collect, sort out, compile, and publish the materials in this area.

Thirdly, there is foreign debt. Foreign debt is the most common tool used by imperialist countries to seize "privileges" through loans to carry out economic and political aggression. From the first Ili loan in 1865 (the fourth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty) to the Xinhai Revolution (1911), there were more than ten large and small loans and twenty industrial loans; from the Xinhai Revolution to the collapse of the Beiyang warlord government in 1927, there were sixteen foreign debts, plus the Japanese "Nishihara Loan"; from the establishment of the Kuomintang reactionary government in Nanjing in 1927 to the liberation of the mainland in 1949, there were more than twenty foreign debts. Finally, foreign debt changed from ordinary loan form to "US aid" form, and was further reduced to a tool for imperialism to carry out economic, political, and military aggression. The archives and materials related to foreign debt are still fully preserved in China, and should be promptly collected, sorted out, compiled, and published.

Fourthly, there is foreign currency. Capitalist countries often use their currency to circulate directly in various trading ports in China when carrying out economic aggression against China. The earliest to flow into China was the Spanish "Benyang", which was imported from the Philippine Islands in the 16th century. In the following hundreds of years, foreign silver coins flowed into China one after another; among the most common were the Mexican "Eagle Dollar", the American "Trade Dollar", the French Saigon Silver Dollar, the Japanese "Dragon Coin", the British Hong Kong "Standing Man Silver Dollar", and the Singapore Silver Dollar. These foreign silver dollars, along with the forces of capitalism, invaded China, manipulated finance, and became the masters of the country, until after the Chinese Guangdong Mint began to cast silver coins in 1887 (the 13th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), did their circulation gradually shrink. During the era of the Beiyang warlord government, the Japanese "Old Man Ticket" circulated in the Northeast; after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American dollar bills flooded various trading ports and economic center cities, and became the target of speculation. The circulation of these foreign currencies in China, as well as the physical objects and materials left behind, should also be promptly collected, sorted out, compiled, and published.

Fifthly, there are stock exchanges and commodity exchanges. The organization of exchanges, following the capitalist invasion of China, was first established in Shanghai, and soon spread to other trading ports. In the stock exchange, speculative trading of various securities is carried out; the securities include bonds and stocks issued by foreign capitalists in China, as well as bonds issued by the Chinese government itself and stocks of Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises. The manipulation of the market prices of the stock exchange is often in the hands of imperialist banks and large monopoly capitalists, and the customs officials sent by imperialism often use their powers to carry out large-scale securities speculation. The case of Robert Hart, the British Inspector-General of Customs, using "customs surplus" as collateral to create an atmosphere to manipulate the market price of the 96 Public Bonds and make a fortune is a prominent example. Commodity exchanges are also controlled by foreigners. Foreign merchants use their various conveniences in transportation and market connections to carry out the dumping of foreign rice, foreign flour, and foreign cotton through commodity exchanges, which plays a disintegrating role in China's rural economy. This part of economic data also needs to be promptly collected and sorted out by us.

Sixthly, there are railways, shipping, air transportation, and postal services. In terms of railways, most of the important railways in the country during this period were built with foreign debt, such as the Beijing-Fengtian, Shanghai-Nanjing, Guangzhou-Kowloon, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Beijing-Hankou lines, which were invested by Britain; the Tianjin-Pukou line, which was invested by Britain and Germany; the Zhengtai line, which was invested by Russia and France; the Bianluo line, which was invested by Belgium; the Chinese Eastern Railway, which was invested by Russia; and most of the railways in the Northeast, which were invested by Japan. Most of these railway loans designated railway revenue and their own property as collateral; they even designated additional tax revenues as collateral and seized railway management rights. In terms of shipping, in addition to manipulating our country's coastal navigation rights, foreign merchants also invaded our country's inland river navigation rights. China's largest inland river route, the Yangtze River, became an international route. Foreign merchants set up docks and warehouses everywhere, creating a shipping system. The foreign shipping companies in China include the British Taikoo Shipping Company, Jardine Matheson Shipping Company, Xiangtai Lumber Shipping Department, Asiatic Petroleum Company, Butterfield & Swire, Kailuan Mining Bureau, and Ewo; the Japanese Nissin Kisen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Dalian Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui & Co., Showa Shipping Co., and Yamashita Kisen Kaisha; the American Jiangjiang Company, Mobil Oil, and Texaco; the Italian Yihua Company and Zhongning Company; in addition, there are merchant ships from France, Denmark, Portugal, the Netherlands, Norway, and Chile. As for those who operate our country's coastal and ocean routes, there are even more countries and tonnages, which have not been calculated. In terms of air transportation, whether it is an airline organized by foreign merchants or an airline manipulated by foreign capital, they are also ubiquitous. The Eurasia Aviation Company, manipulated by the German Lufthansa, was established earlier, and the China National Aviation Corporation, manipulated by the American Pacific Airlines, was established later; by the end of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the notorious Chennault established the Civil Air Transport, transporting munitions and troops for the Kuomintang reactionaries everywhere, speculating and smuggling, doing everything. In terms of postal services, at the beginning, it was handled concurrently by the customs; it was not until after the Xinhai Revolution that it was completely under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, but the influence of the French was still quite large. In addition, there are so-called "passenger posts"; among the passenger posts, there are Western imperialist countries (centered on Dongjiaomin Lane) and Japanese imperialist countries (centered on Qingdao and Dalian). In terms of telecommunications, our country's telecommunications industry was initially monopolized by foreign merchants' water and electricity companies. These foreign-invested or managed enterprises in transportation, communications, and postal services can manipulate our country's national economy and people's livelihood and affect our country's political and military affairs, and are extremely closely related to our country's modern national economic history. Most of the archives and materials in this area are still left in China, and also need to be promptly collected, sorted out, compiled, and published.

Finally, there is the acquisition, manufacturing, and dumping of raw materials. The economic aggression of imperialist countries, on the one hand, regards China as a place to supply raw materials, and on the other hand, regards China as a market for dumping goods; at the same time, they use concessions to set up factories, use cheap raw materials and labor, manufacture in China, and then dump them to the inland. In terms of raw material acquisition, in addition to mobilizing the financial institutions, transportation institutions, and comprador personnel they control, they also use the power of bureaucratic capital (such as the Kuomintang reactionary government's Trade Commission) to purchase tung oil, raw silk, pig bristles, tea, and various minerals such as copper, tin, tungsten, and antimony at low prices. Imperialist countries directly seized mining rights in China and mined them themselves (for example, Japan in the Northeast mines, Britain in Tangshan, Mentougou coal mines, and Germany in Jingxing coal mines, etc.). In terms of commodity manufacturing, there is even richer information, among which foreign-owned yarn factories, silk factories, flour mills, and cigarette factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, and Guangzhou occupy an important position. In terms of commodity dumping, they use the customs they control to unilaterally stipulate our country's customs import and export tariff regulations to carry out general commodity dumping; they also use exchange rate policies to reduce exchange rates to carry out "exchange rate dumping." As a result, foreign goods are ubiquitous, on the one hand, hitting the industrial and commercial enterprises operated by Chinese national capitalists, making them unable to develop and falling into a dying state; on the other hand, destroying the side industries in rural areas, prompting the rural economy to go bankrupt. This aspect of economic data is extremely rich and complex, and also needs to be collected, analyzed, compiled, and published.

The above economic data from various departments are just a few examples, and are not enough to describe an outline. And among these departments, there are also close relationships, intertwined, and mutually communicative, forming a blood-sucking network of economic aggression. We suggest that in the draft of the science plan, this aspect of research should be strengthened, first collecting data, analyzing it, and sorting it out, and then compiling and publishing it. The data in this department may be called "Compilation of Data on Imperialist Economic Aggression against China," and the content is divided into (1) Customs, (2) Foreign Banks, (3) Foreign Debt, (4) Foreign Currency, (5) Stock Exchanges and Commodity Exchanges, (6) Railways, (7) Shipping, (8) Air Transportation, (9) Postal Services, (10) Raw Material Acquisition, (11) Foreign Factories, (12) Commodity Dumping, classified, sorted out, and compiled, and then published for reference in the study of China's modern national economic history.

Collecting data is the foundation for studying China's modern national economic history, and studying China's modern national economic history is the core issue in studying China's modern history. We hope that scientific research institutions will strengthen planning, organize research forces in various fields, widely collect data, and conduct research in a planned and step-by-step manner. In this way, we can hope to write a relatively complete "History of China's Modern National Economy" within twelve years, and make it close to the world's advanced scientific level.

    应该研究帝国主义对中国经济侵略的历史
    朱契
    在十二年科学规划草案中间，关于经济学的重要问题中，列出1840—1949年中国国民经济史一项，说明“包括中国资本主义发展的历史、近代中国土地问题和土地制度改革的历史、民主革命时期各革命根据地的经济史”。在历史学重要问题中，又列出1840—1949年的中国历史一项，认为应该“系统和全面地阐明中国半殖民地半封建社会的演变过程，总结这个历史时期的中国人民革命斗争的经验”。这两个重要问题，是互相有关联的，但是值得注意的是，在这两个重要问题中，都没有指出或强调指出帝国主义对中国经济侵略的历史；而要研究1840—1949年中国的国民经济史，不可能不涉及帝国主义对中国经济侵略的历史。从鸦片战争以后，到中国解放前夕，整整一百多年。在这一百多年中，正是帝国主义对中国一步步进行经济侵略，使中国一步步沦为半封建半殖民地的社会的时期。虽然这个时期已经成为过去，但是帝国主义势力还没有完全消除；而且经济侵略对我国国民经济的影响，是深而且巨的。现在离开这个时期还并不很远，应该及时把帝国主义对中国经济侵略的史料，加以搜集、整理、编纂和印行，先打下研究中国近代国民经济史的基础。
    我们整理1840—1949年中国国民经济的历史，比整理以前任何一个时期的历史都要来得重要。但是恰好这一部门历史，是中国近代史中间比较薄弱的环节。解放前，虽有若干先进作家，对帝国主义经济侵略的历史，作了一些轮廓性的叙述，但是是不够深入和不够全面的。解放后，这一方面的研究工作也是进展得很迟缓的。帝国主义经济侵略的许多资料和档案——如海关、银行、外国货币流通情形、外债、证券交易所、商品交易所、铁路、航运、客邮、堆栈、原料收购、制造、商品倾销等等——还没有认真加以搜集和整理，更谈不到有系统地和全面地加以叙述和描写了。
    原来资本主义和帝国主义对华经济侵略，是有它们完整的一套体系的。它们首先控制我们的海关，掌握我们进出口贸易的咽喉。海关在帝国主义控制之下，权力是如此之大，它利用海关税收，操纵我国财政；它管理沿海沿江航道，控制灯塔航标，甚至兼管港务。海关在外人管理之下，从1854年（清咸丰四年）设立海关税务司起，到1949年中国解放为止，有将近一百年的历史，所以它保存的档案、资料，特别丰富。除了已经历年公布的海关进口税及出口税税则，海关税收统计，进出口贸易统计，进口货物类编，出口货物类编，国内贸易土货转口统计外，还有许多秘密文件，从这些秘密文件中，可以看出帝国主义操纵我国财政的阴谋，对中国实行经济侵略甚至政治侵略、军事侵略的诡计。这些统计、报告和海关秘密文件，对于研究中国近代国民经济史都十分重要，但是解放以来，还不曾进行有系统的搜集、整理、编纂和印行。我建议要研究资本主义和帝国主义对华的经济侵略，首先应从搜集、整理海关资料着手。
    其次是有关外国银行方面的资料。原来帝国主义国家在华进行经济侵略，首先要在中国设立银行，作为它们操纵金融、输出资本的枢纽，到了时机成熟的时候，再进一步共管中国财政。最早设立的是英国的汇丰银行（在1877年以前已经设立），其次相继成立的有法国的东方汇理银行、德国的德华银行、帝俄的道胜银行、美国的花旗银行、比国的华比银行、日本的横滨正金银行。起初这些银行，互相竞争；最后联合起来，垄断资本市场，四国银行团（英法德美）组织在先（1911），五国银行团（英法德日俄）成立在后（1913），终于在国际垄断资本操纵和压迫之下，同我国当时的北洋军阀政府订立了所谓“善后大借款”。这个善后大借款，是典型的帝国主义垄断资本进行经济侵略的借款，不但以关税收入作担保，并且还要指定以盐税为担保；不但控制海关，还要进一步控制盐务；不但严格限制借款用途，还要进一步监督我国财政（审计处设立洋稽核员，领款凭单须经其签字，再经过银行代表核对，方得提款）。这些帝国主义国家在华设立的银行，对于中国民族资本家和民族工业，也随时随地加以摧残，加以打击，如1935年汇丰银行非法拍卖申新第七纱厂，即为一典型的例子。这些帝国主义银行的档案资料，有的被我国正式接收了（如日本横滨正金银行、德华银行），有的还有一部分留在中国，但未能正式接收（如汇丰银行）。我们要研究资本主义和帝国主义对华的经济侵略，也应该及时把这方面的材料加以搜集、整理、编纂和印行。
    再其次是外债。外债是帝国主义国家利用借款攫取“特权”进行经济侵略和政治侵略最常用的一种工具。从1865年（清同治四年）第一次伊犁借款起，到辛亥革命（1911）为止，凡有大小借款十余次，实业借款二十次；从辛亥革命到1927年北洋军阀政府崩溃为止，凡有外债十六次，另外日本“西原借款”一次；从1927年国民党反动政府在南京成立起，到1949年大陆解放为止，凡有外债二十余次。最后外债由普通借款形式变为“美援”形式，更沦为帝国主义进行经济侵略和政治、军事侵略的工具。有关外债的档案和资料，还全部保存在国内，应该及时加以搜集、整理、编纂和印行。
    再其次是外国货币。资本主义国家用经济侵略中国，往往利用它们的货币直接在中国各贸易口岸流通。最早流入中国的，是西班牙的本洋，还是十六世纪从菲律滨群岛输入的。此后数百年间，外国银币，陆续流入中国；其中最常见的，有墨西哥的鹰洋、美国的“贸易银元”，法国的西贡银元，日本的“龙番”，英国的香港“站人银元”，新加坡银元等。这一些外国银元，随着资本主义的势力，侵入中国，操纵金融，喧宾夺主，一直到1887年（清光绪13年）中国广东造币厂自铸银币以后，方才逐渐缩小它们的流通范围。到了北洋军阀政府时代，日本“老头票”，又在东北一带流通；抗战胜利以后，美国的美元钞票，又泛滥各通商口岸和各经济中心城市，并且成为投机的对象。这些外国货币在中国的流通情形以及所留下来的实物和资料，也应该及时加及搜集、整理、编纂和印行。
    再其次是证券交易所和商品交易所。交易所的组织，随着资本主义侵入中国，最早在上海成立，不久即传播到其他通商口岸。在证券交易所中，进行着各式各样有价证券的投机买卖；有价证券中，包括外国资本主义在中国发行的债券、股票以及中国政府自己发行的债券和中国工商企业的股票。操纵证券交易所行市的，往往是帝国主义的银行和大垄断资本家，而帝国主义派来的海关官员，也往往利用他们的职权，进行大规模的证券投机买卖。海关总税务司英人安格联利用“关余”作担保制造空气来操纵九六公债行市因而大发其财，便是一个显著的例子。商品交易所也操纵在外国人之手，洋商利用他们交通运输上和市场联系上的种种便利，通过商品交易所进行洋米、洋粉、洋棉的倾销，对中国的农村经济起着瓦解的作用。这一部分经济资料，也有待于我们及时加以搜集和整理。
    再其次是铁路、航运、空运、邮政。在铁路方面，这个时期内全国各重要铁路，极大部分是借外债所筑，如京奉，沪宁，广九，沪杭甬，京汉等线由英国投资；津浦由英、德投资；正太由俄、法投资；汴洛由比利时投资；中东铁路由俄国投资；东北极大部分铁路由日本投资。这些铁路借款，大多数指定以铁路收入及本身财产，作为担保；甚至于还要另外指定税款担保，并攫夺铁路管理权。在航运方面，外商除了操纵我国沿海航行权之外，更侵占我国内河航行权，我国最大的内河航路长江，变成了一条国际航路，洋商到处设立码头、堆栈，造成了一个航运系统。在中国的外国轮船公司，有英商的太古轮船公司、怡和轮船公司、祥泰木行轮船部、亚细亚火油公司、赉赐洋行、开滦矿务局、汇德丰洋行；有日商的日清汽船会社、大阪商船会社、大连汽船会社、三井洋行、昭和汽船会社、山下汽船会社；有美商的捷江公司、美孚洋行、德士古洋行；意商的义华公司、中宁公司；此外还有法国、丹麦、葡萄牙、荷兰、挪威、智利各国商船。至于经营我国沿海及远洋航路者，国别及吨位更多，还没有计算在内。在空运方面，不论外商组织的航空公司或是由外资操纵的航空公司，他们也是无孔不入的。德国汉沙航空公司操纵的欧亚航空公司成立于前，美国太平洋航空公司操纵的中国航空公司成立于后；到了国民党反动统治末期，臭名远扬的陈纳德，更成立民用航空大队，到处替国民党反动派运军火、运部队、投机走私、无所不为。在邮政方面，最早的时候，是由海关兼办；到了辛亥革命以后，才完全归交通部管辖，但是法国人的势力，还是相当之大。此外又有所谓“客邮”；客邮中间，又有西方帝国主义国家所办的客邮（以东交民巷为中心），及日本帝国主义所办的客邮（以青岛、大连为中心）。在电信方面，我国电信事业，起初也是由外商水电公司所垄断。这些交通、运输、邮电方面的外人投资或管理的企业，都可以操纵我国的国计民生，影响我国的政治军事，对于我国近代国民经济史，关系极为密切。这一部分档案及资料，还大部分留在国内，也有待于及时搜集、整理、编纂和印行。
    最后是关于原料收购、商品制造和倾销。帝国主义国家的经济侵略，一方面把中国看作一个原料的供给地方，另一方面又把中国看作一个商品倾销市场；同时又利用租界，设立工厂，利用低廉的原料和劳动力，就在中国制造，再向内地倾销。在原料收购方面，除了动员它们所控制的金融机关、交通运输机关和买办人员以外，更利用官僚资本势力（例如国民党反动政府的贸易委员会），低价收进桐油、生丝、猪鬃、茶叶以及铜、锡、钨、锑各种矿产。帝国主义国家，更直接在中国攫夺矿权，自己开采（例如日本之于东北矿产，英国之于唐山，门头沟煤矿，德国之于井陉煤矿等）。在商品制造方面，资料更为丰富，其中尤以上海、天津、青岛、沈阳、广州各地的外商纱厂、丝厂、面粉厂，卷烟厂，占重要地位。在商品倾销方面，它们利用所控制的海关，片面规定我国的海关进口出口税则，进行一般的商品倾销；更运用汇兑方面降低汇价政策，进行“汇兑倾销”，结果外国商品，无孔不入，一方面打击了中国的民族资本家所经营的工商业，使它不能发展，陷于奄奄一息的境地；另一方面摧毁了农村里的副业，促使农村经济陷于破产。这一方面的经济资料，异常丰富而且复杂，也有待于搜集、分析、编纂和印行。
    以上各部门的经济资料，不过举其大者，还够不上一个轮廓的描写。而在这各部门之间，又互有密切的关系，千丝万缕，互通声气，构成了经济侵略的一个吸血的网。我们建议在科学规划草案中，应该加强这一方面的研究，首先搜集资料、加以分析、整理，然后编纂印行。这个部门的资料，不妨称为“帝国主义对中国经济侵略资料汇编”，内容分为（1）海关，（2）外国银行，（3）外债，（4）外国货币，（5）证券交易所和商品交易所，（6）铁路，（7）航运，（8）空运，（9）邮政，（10）原料收购，（11）外商工厂，（12）商品倾销，分门别类，加以整理编纂，然后印行，以供研究中国近代国民经济史的参考。
    搜集资料是研究中国近代国民经济史的基础，而研究中国近代国民经济史又是研究中国近代史的核心问题。我们希望科学研究机关加强规划，组织各方面研究力量，广泛搜集资料，有计划、有步骤地进行研究。这样，我们才可希望在十二年内，写出一部比较完整的“中国近代国民经济史”，并且使它接近世界先进的科学水平。
