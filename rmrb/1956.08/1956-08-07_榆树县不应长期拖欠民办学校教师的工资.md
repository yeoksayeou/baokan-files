    Yushu County Should Not Delay Paying Wages to Teachers in Private Schools for Extended Periods
To the Editor:
    The phenomenon of Yushu County, Jilin Province, delaying the payment of wages to teachers in private schools is very serious. It is understood that twelve out of the county's (before the division of townships) twenty districts are in arrears with the wages of teachers in private schools. The former Daling District owed 1,930 yuan to eighteen teachers in private schools in 1955. From January to May 1956, ten teachers did not receive their wages, and the total arrears from 1952 to May 1956 amounted to 5,224 yuan. Li Yayu has been working as a teacher in a private school since 1952, and as of May of this year, he has received a total of 375 yuan in wages, which only accounts for 27% of the wages he should have received. Teachers in private schools have difficulty making ends meet due to the long-term non-payment of wages, and some teachers even have to borrow money and rice from others to survive.
    The fact that teachers in private schools cannot receive their wages in a timely manner is inseparable from the long-term lack of concern for the lives of primary school teachers by relevant departments in Yushu County, especially the education administrative departments. Teachers in private schools have repeatedly reported the unreasonable phenomenon of wage arrears to the education administrative departments, but they have not received due attention (now they have begun to resolve it). Some cadres mistakenly regard the reasonable demands of teachers for timely payment of wages as "individualism" and "excessive personal interests," and criticize and reprimand them. Teachers are part of the working class, and the remuneration they obtain through labor should be paid to them in a timely manner. It is hoped that the education administrative departments of Yushu County can solve this problem as soon as possible. Zhang Shuhua

### 榆树县不应长期拖欠民办学校教师的工资

    榆树县不应长期拖欠民办学校教师的工资编辑同志：
    吉林省榆树县拖欠民办学校教师工资的现象很严重。据了解，全县（划乡前）二十个区里就有十二个区拖欠民办学校教师的工资。原来的大岭区1955年就拖欠十八名民办学校教师工资1，930元，1956年1月至5月有十名教师没领到工资，从1952年到1956年5月共拖欠教师工资5，224元。李亚玉从1952年做民办学校教师，到今年五月止，共领到工资375元，只占应得工资的27％。民办学校教师长期领不到工资，生活很困难，甚至有的教师经常向别人借钱、借米过日子。
    民办学校教师不能及时领到工资是同榆树县有关部门，特别是教育行政部门长期不关心小学教师的生活分不开的。民办学校教师曾多次向教育行政部门反映拖欠工资的不合理现象，但是没有得到应有的重视（现在已经开始进行解决），有的干部把教师请求及时发给工资的合理要求，错误地认为是“个人主义”、“个人利益太浓厚”，给以批评和斥责。教师是工人阶级的一部分，他们以劳动所取得的报酬，应当及时发给他们。希望榆树县教育行政部门能够尽快地解决这个问题。　张树华
