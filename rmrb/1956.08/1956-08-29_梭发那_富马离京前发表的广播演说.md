Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, said in a broadcast speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station: "It is a great honor for me to lead a Lao delegation of friendly neighbors to China, representing a completely independent and autonomous country that is eager to consolidate and be respected for its independence." He said, "The Lao people do not participate in this or that bloc because they firmly believe that the happiness of mankind can only be built on the basis of peaceful coexistence among all nations. As long as its security is not threatened, it has never joined and will never join any military alliance. It desires to live in harmony with all peoples, especially with its neighbors.

The Prime Minister, in his broadcast speech to the Chinese people at the invitation of the radio station, said: "Among the people whose friendship we seek, the Chinese people occupy one of the most important positions. The friendly relations between Laos and its great northern neighbor are not new." He added, "Today we are restoring our past traditional friendship and firmly believe that the peaceful coexistence between our two peoples is built on the foundation of trust and friendship."

This broadcast speech by Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma was recorded by the Central People's Broadcasting Station before he left Beijing and was broadcast today. In his speech, the Prime Minister expressed his warm gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai for his kind invitation and was deeply moved by the spontaneous and courteous welcome of the Chinese people. In his speech, the Prime Minister also described in detail the historical origins and geographical situation of the Lao people and spoke of the Lao people's struggle for unity and independence. He said: "The desire for unity is not only the will of the leaders but can be said to be a desire from the depths of the Lao people's hearts." Then, the Prime Minister spoke about his recent talks with Prince Souphanouvong in Vientiane. He said: "After centuries of historical suffering and the final test of ten years of war, we have finally achieved unity and independence. We can now proudly say that the Kingdom of Laos is now a unified and independent country." He said, "Now, only some minor issues remain to be resolved, and these issues will not hinder the independence and unity of our country."

Finally, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma once again thanked the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their hospitality. He said: "I once again assure you that we will never forget the Chinese people's friendly expressions towards Laos. I am convinced that this renewed friendship will flourish and bring lasting peace to our two peoples."

    新华社28日讯　老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王在中央人民广播电台发表广播讲话说：“我率领着友好睦邻的老挝代表团到中国来，代表一个完全独立自主并且渴望巩固和使人尊重其独立的国家，这对我说来是莫大的荣幸。”他说，“老挝人民不参加这一个或者那一个集团，因为它深信人类的幸福只能建筑在各国人民和平共处的基础上。只要它的安全不受到威胁，它从来没有、将来也不会加入任何军事同盟。它渴望和各国人民，特别是和邻国人民和睦相处。
    这位首相在应邀向中国人民发表的广播讲话中说：“在我们寻求友谊的人民当中，占有头等重要地位之一的就是中国人民。老挝和它的伟大的北方邻国之间的友好关系并不是一件新的事情。”他又说，“今天我们重新恢复过去的传统友谊，并且坚信贵我两国人民的和平共处是建筑在信任和友好的基础上的。”
    梭发那·富马首相的这一广播讲话是他在离开北京以前由中央人民广播电台录音后在今天发表的。首相在讲话中对周恩来总理对他的善意邀请表示热烈感谢，并且对中国人民出乎自然的、彬彬有礼的热情欢迎深为感动。首相在讲话中还详细地叙述了老挝人民的历史渊源和老挝的地理情况，并且谈到了老挝人民为了争取统一和独立的斗争。他说：“祈求统一不仅是领导者的意愿，而且可以说是老挝人民心灵深处的要求。”接着，首相又谈到了不久以前和苏发努冯亲王在万象举行的会谈。他说：“经过了几百年的历史苦难，又经受了十年战争的最后考验，我们终于实现了统一和独立。我们现在可以自豪地说：老挝王国从今以后已经是一个统一和独立的国家了。”他说，“现在尚待解决的不过是一些次要的问题，这些问题是不会妨害我们国家的独立和统一的。”
    梭发那·富马首相最后再一次地感谢中国政府和中国人民的盛情款待。他说：“我再一次保证：中国人民对老挝的友好表示，我们将永志不忘。我深信这种重新恢复起来的友谊将会滋长繁荣，使贵我两国人民永享和平。”
