Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 12th: The People's Committee of Pingnan County, Fujian Province, recently awarded a bonus to Zhang Weirong, a member of the Liyangzhong Agricultural Cooperative in Shanling Township, to commend his heroic act of single-handedly killing a tiger.

On the evening of July 13th, Zhang Weirong went to the sweet potato seedling plot to cut seedlings when suddenly a tiger ran past him, biting a dog. He thought that if this tiger escaped, it would bring great disaster to the villagers. He immediately shouted to three cooperative members who were chopping firewood nearby, and they took their choppers and chased after the tiger separately.

When Zhang Weirong chased the tiger alone into the dense forest, the tiger turned around and pounced on him. Zhang Weirong immediately raised his chopper and hacked fiercely at the tiger's head. After being injured, the tiger pounced on Zhang Weirong even more fiercely. Zhang Weirong's head and hands were bitten by the tiger and were covered in blood, but he still held the chopper tightly and continued to hack at the tiger's head. Unexpectedly, the tiger pounced again, and the chopper fell to the ground. At this critical moment of life and death, he desperately grabbed the tiger's front paw with his left hand, clenched his right fist, and used all his strength to punch the tiger's nose. After punching for about twenty minutes, the tiger collapsed to the ground from exhaustion, and Zhang Weirong was also exhausted, his body injured, and he fainted on the ground. At this time, the other three cooperative members arrived and beat the dying tiger to death, and sent Zhang Weirong to the hospital for treatment.

After the news of Zhang Weirong's single-handed killing of the tiger spread, the Pingnan County People's Committee immediately sent people to the hospital to express their condolences and provided all his medical expenses.

    单身杀一虎
    农民张伟荣受奖
    据新华社福州12日电　福建省屏南县人民委员会最近授给山岭乡里洋中农业社社员张伟荣一笔奖金，奖励他单身打死一只老虎的英勇行为。
    七月十三日傍晚，张伟荣到番薯苗圃里去剪薯苗，突然有只老虎咬着一条狗从他身旁跑过。他想，若让这只老虎逃走，不知会给乡亲们带来多大的祸害。他立即喊叫附近砍柴的三个社员，拿着柴刀分头向老虎追去。
    当张伟荣一人追到密林中时，老虎回头向他扑来，张伟荣立即举起柴刀，向老虎头部猛砍，老虎受伤后，更加凶猛地向张伟荣扑来。张伟荣的头部、手上被老虎咬得鲜血淋淋，但他仍然紧紧握住柴刀继续向老虎头上乱砍，不料，又被老虎一扑，柴刀脱手落地。在这生死关头，他奋不顾身地用左手紧紧拉住老虎前脚，右手握紧拳头，用全身气力向老虎鼻子上打去，打了二十分钟光景，老虎疲乏倒地，张伟荣也已精疲力尽，全身负伤，昏倒地上。这时候，其他三个社员赶到，就把快要断气的老虎打死，把张伟荣送到医院治疗。
    张伟荣单身打死老虎的消息传出后，屏南县人民委员会随即派人到医院慰问他，并供给他的全部医疗费用。
