Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: A delegation of Japanese former military personnel arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. They are visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

The delegation consists of fifteen former Japanese military personnel, including three former Lieutenant Generals of the Army, one former Vice Admiral of the Navy, and nine former officers of the rank of Colonel.

Upon disembarking from the plane, the guests warmly shook hands with those who welcomed them. Saburo Endo, former Lieutenant General of the Army who visited China last year, introduced all members of the delegation to those who were welcoming them.

Saburo Endo said at the airport: "Friendly relations between Japan and China are very important for peace in Asia. Without friendship between Japan and China, there will be no peace in Asia, and the basis of this friendship is mutual understanding. Therefore, through this visit, we want to understand China well."

When talking about the preparations for this visit by the delegation, Saburo Endo especially pointed out that former Prince, former Prime Minister, and Army General Naruhiko Higashikuni and former Army Minister, Field Marshal Shunroku Hata had given great support.

Japanese people in Beijing, Togo Kameda and Kenta Kaneko, were also at the airport to welcome them.

The delegation arrived in Guangzhou yesterday. Xie Nanguang, Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Xiao Xiangqian, Deputy Secretary-General, went to Shenzhen to meet them and accompanied them to Beijing.
