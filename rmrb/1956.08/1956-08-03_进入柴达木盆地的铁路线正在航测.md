Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd – The railway line entering the Qaidam Basin from the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, specifically the section from Huangyuan in Qinghai Province via Dulan to Mangnai in the Qaidam Basin, is being surveyed by airplane. More than 3,000 square kilometers have already been surveyed aerially.

According to preliminary calculations, this section of the line is approximately 1,080 kilometers long, mostly on the sparsely populated Qaidam Basin. Because the climate here is very harsh, if manual ground surveys were used, not only would there be many difficulties, but the work efficiency would also be relatively low. Using aerial surveys can speed up the progress and select an ideal route for developing the resources of the Qaidam Basin as soon as possible.

    进入柴达木盆地的铁路线正在航测
    新华社兰州2日电　兰州—青海铁路进入柴达木盆地的铁路线，正在从青海省湟源经都兰到柴达木盆地芒涯一段的上空用飞机勘测。目前已经航测了三千平方公里以上的面积。
    据初步计算，这段线路约长一千零八十公里，大部分在人烟稀少的柴达木盆地上；因为这里气候很恶劣，如果用人工在地面上勘测，不但要碰到许多困难，工作效率也比较低。利用飞机勘测，就可加速进度，及早为开发柴达木盆地资源选择一条理想的线路。
