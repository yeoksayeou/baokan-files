    The First Large-Scale New-Type Petroleum Machinery Plant
    Construction Begins on Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant

    (Our newspaper reports) The earthwork leveling project for China's first large-scale, modern petroleum machinery plant—the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant—fully commenced mechanized construction in mid-July.

    Workers from the Lanzhou Earthwork Engineering Team of the Mechanized Construction General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, who are responsible for the earthwork leveling project of the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant, are driving earthmoving machinery across the vast construction site. The first phase, involving over 20,000 cubic meters of filling and excavation work for the factory front area and the third workshop, is nearing completion. The leveling of the main part of the plant area will be basically completed before the end of the year.

    In order to meet the needs of plant construction and prepare for construction work, the Fifth Engineering Office of the Lanzhou Engineering General Company, which is undertaking the construction task of the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant, is working with the plant preparatory office to carry out the 1956 construction organization design. The comprehensive processing plant serving the construction is also under intense construction. Among them, the cement warehouse, steel bar finished product warehouse, workers' dormitory, and office have been completed. The civil construction of the wood model workshop and steel bar processing workshop have been completed, and equipment installation is underway. Other facilities, such as the fine wood workshop and the concrete and mortar mixing station, will also be under construction soon. The dedicated railway line leading from the Lanzhou hub station to the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant will also be opened to traffic soon.

    The welfare area of the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant already presents a prosperous scene. Fourteen three-story single and family dormitories with heating and sanitary facilities have been completed, and dormitory construction is continuing. The poplar and locust trees planted around the dormitory blocks have also formed rows of green trees.

    第一个规模巨大的新型石油机械厂
    兰州石油机械厂开始动工
    本报讯　我国第一个规模巨大的、现代化的石油机械厂——兰州石油机械厂的厂区平整工程，于七月中旬全面展开机械化施工。
    担任兰州石油机械厂厂区平整工程的建筑工程部机械化施工总公司兰州土方工程队的工人们，正驾驶着土方机械驰骋在辽阔的施工现场。第一期厂前区和第三工场两万多立方公尺的填、挖工程即将结束，年底以前将基本完成厂区主要部分的平整工作。
    为了适应建厂需要，作好施工准备工作，承担兰州石油机械厂施工任务的兰州工程总公司第五工程处，会同这个厂筹备处正在进行1956年的施工组织设计工作。为施工服务的综合加工厂也在紧张建设。其中水泥仓库、钢筋成品库、工人宿舍和办公室已修建完成，木模车间、和钢筋加工车间的土建工程已经竣工，设备安装工作正在进行。其他如细木车间，混凝土、灰浆搅拌站等也即将施工。从兰州枢纽站铺向兰州石油机械厂厂区的铁路专用线也即将通车。
    兰州石油机械厂的福利区，已呈现一片繁荣景象，十四幢三层的有暖气卫生设备的单身和家属宿舍已经完工，现在宿舍工程还在继续修建；宿舍街坊四周种植的杨槐，也已绿树成行。
