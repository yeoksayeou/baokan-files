    Merger of Cooperatives (10)

    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    37 "Fire! Fire!" South Field Garden was already a blaze of fire, and the thick smoke obscured the moon. People rushed to the field garden with buckets and forks. Everyone at the meeting also shouted and rushed to put out the fire.
    38 Only to see Qiao Tianrui walking over with a handful of burning grain stalks, saying, "I just finished a meeting at the mutual aid group and just walked here when I saw someone running east, and then the fire started over there... Director Li, this grass smells like kerosene!"
    39 Fortunately, the fire was quickly extinguished. Li Baichuan asked Qiao Tianrui what kind of clothes the arsonist was wearing. Qiao Tianrui deliberately wanted to implicate Shuming, saying, "A fox fur hat, a yellowish-yellow upper body..." Li Baichuan stamped his foot, "Good! It's him!"
    40 Qiao Tianrui also told Li Baichuan: Deputy Secretary Ma of the district committee has arrived and is staying at Da Lunzi's house. It would be best to go find him early tomorrow morning. At this time, Yinghua was at the door of Gui Xia's house, asking Gui Xia to pass a note to Shuming, saying, "Don't let anyone see it. If there's a reply, get it to me right away!"

    37　“救火呀！救火呀！”南场园已是一片火光腾跳，浓烟把月亮也遮住了。人们挑桶抄叉，赶到场园去，会场上的人也全都呼喊着赶去救火。
    38　只见乔天瑞拿着一把带火的谷秸子走来说：“我在互助组开完会，刚走到这儿，见一个人往东跑了，接着那边就起了火……李主任，这草上还有煤油味儿！”
    39　幸而很快便把火扑灭了。李百川问乔天瑞，放火那人穿什么衣裳。乔天瑞故意要赖树明，说：“狐狸皮帽子，黄滢滢的上身……”李百川把脚一跺：“好哇！是他！”
    40　乔天瑞又告诉李百川：区委马副书记来了，住在大轮子家，最好明天一早去找他。这时，莺花正在桂霞家门口，叫桂霞递个条子给树明，说：“别叫人看见。有回条，马上拿给我！”
