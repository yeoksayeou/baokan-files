    “Troublesome” Letters
    Some organizations, fearing trouble, politely decline when they receive readers' letters forwarded by the newspaper office, saying they are not letters sent to them directly.
    If these organizations could examine the reasons why letters are not "sent directly" to them and eradicate those reasons, it would eliminate a lot of trouble.

    “麻烦”的信件
    有些机关怕麻烦，接到报社转去的读者来信时，婉转谢绝，说不是直接寄给他们的信件。
    这些机关如果能够检查一下不“直接寄给”自己的原因，并予以根除，这将消除不少的麻烦。
