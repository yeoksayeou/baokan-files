    "Mobilization"
    Nancun
    To get the masses to do what they should do and are capable of doing, it is usually necessary to mobilize them when they have not yet intended to do it or are not consciously aware that they should do it. "Mobilization" means doing persuasive education work so that those being mobilized act entirely voluntarily, without any coercion whatsoever.
    However, in some villages, "mobilization" has become synonymous with compulsory orders. When credit cooperatives absorb deposits from agricultural cooperative members, they first deduct the money that should be distributed to the members from the agricultural cooperative leaders, and then hold a large meeting to lecture the members on grand principles. The members can't even see or touch the money they are entitled to, and it's impossible to ask to keep three or five yuan to make a piece of clothing. This is called "mobilizing" deposits. When credit cooperatives want to expand their share capital, what should they do if the members don't have money? They launch a "tap potential" campaign, telling the members to hand over their saved cotton, timber, gold and silver jewelry. This is called "mobilizing" share expansion. Agricultural cooperatives freeze members' deposits in credit cooperatives, and even search members' homes to find out their assets, demanding that members contribute property. This is called "mobilizing" investment. …
    Since these practices are all called "mobilization," members are unwilling and inconvenient to object. The things that everyone is being mobilized to do are good things related to building socialism. If you are unwilling or you object, doesn't that show that you are backward? Who wants to wear a "backward" hat? Moreover, whether you are willing or not, the money is already in someone else's hands, and the property is right in front of your eyes, so what else is there to say? It's better to bite the bullet and say "agree" or "no objection" to avoid trouble. As a result, those doing "mobilization" work are very satisfied: without doing in-depth persuasive education work, they "completed the task" all at once. They don't think about how much dissatisfaction the "mobilized" people have, whether they have difficulties, and even less about what kind of consequences this will have.
    Now, many agricultural cooperatives are distributing advance purchase grain surplus payments or sideline income cash. The erroneous practice of forcibly deducting money from farmers and forcing farmers to invest has been opposed everywhere, and "after 'mobilization,' the masses volunteer" has once again become an excuse for a few people who are accustomed to compulsory orders. Throw away this excuse quickly, and let the word "mobilization" restore its original meaning!

    “动员”
    南村
    要群众做他们应该做而又可能做到的事，当他们还没有打算去做，或者还不自觉应该去做的时候，通常要对他们进行动员。“动员”，就是做说服教育工作，让被动员的人做事完全出于自愿，决没有半点强迫的意思。
    可是，在一些乡村里，“动员”变成强迫命令的代名词了。信用社向农业社员吸收存款，先在农业社的领导人那里把应分给社员的钱扣下来，然后开个大会，向社员讲一通大道理，社员连自己应分的钱都看不见、摸不着，要求留下三、五元做件衣服也不可能。这叫做“动员”存款。信用社要扩大股金，社员没有钱，怎么办呢？来个“挖潜力”运动，叫社员把自己存下的棉花、木材、金银首饰都交出来。这叫做“动员”扩股。农业社冻结社员在信用社里的存款，甚至到社员家里给社员查家底，要社员拿出财物。这叫做“动员”投资。……
    既然这种种作法都叫做“动员”，社员不愿意也不便反对。要动员大家来做的事都是有关建设社会主义的好事，你不愿、你反对，不是表明你落后么？谁愿意戴上一顶“落后”的帽子呢？而且，你愿意也罢，不愿意也罢，反正钱已经拿在别人手里，财物摆在眼面前，还有什么好说呢？倒不如硬着头皮说声“同意”或者“没意见”，免得麻烦。于是，这些做“动员”工作的人都很满意：用不着做深入的说服教育工作，一下子就“完成了任务”。他们却不想想被“动员”的人有多大不满，有没有困难，更不想想这样做会发生什么样的后果。
    现在，许多农业社都在分配预购余粮款或副业收入现金。强行向农民扣款、强迫农民投资的错误做法既已到处遭到反对，“经过‘动员’，群众自愿”就又成为少数习惯了强迫命令的人的借口。快把这种借口丢掉吧，让“动员”这个字眼恢复它原有的意思吧！
