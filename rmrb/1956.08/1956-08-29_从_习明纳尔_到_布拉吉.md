    From "Seminar" to "Bulaji"
    Yan Xiu
    A few years ago, some newspapers and magazines really made a fuss about the "Seminar" issue, as if some divine object had flown in from outer space, and getting it would solve all problems. According to my work, I should pay my respects to this Mr. "Seminar," but around 1953, at a conference discussing cadre education, someone was again talking endlessly about how "Seminar" this and "Seminar" that. I couldn't help but ask, "What is a Seminar?" This question caused a little unease, but it did help clarify the issue: this so-called "Seminar" is said to be the Chinese word for "self-study."
    Recently, newspapers and periodicals have been frequently discussing clothing issues, and I keep seeing "Bulaji," "Bulaji," and I don't know what it means, which is very puzzling. A few days ago, I happened to go to the women's clothing store outside Qianmen for a stroll, and then I understood that the entire store was full of "Bulaji" – "Bulaji" means women's dresses.
    I am not a national essence派 (staunch supporter of Chinese culture), advocating the rejection of all foreign nouns and terms. However, I am firmly opposed to this kind of nonsense. In Guangzhou, a ball is called "Bo," and underwear is called "裇 (She)," and as for going to some so-called "restaurants" or "饭馆 (Fanguan)" in Guangzhou to eat, it is even more of a pain, because the names of the entire menu are similar to "Seminar" and "Bulaji." Entering such a place is more infuriating than entering a foreign prison.
    Things that can only be transliterated, such as people's names, and forcibly turning them into Chinese names, such as translating Tolstoy as "Tao Si Dao," was vehemently opposed by Mr. Lu Xun. But that is not to say that all transliterations of foreign things are good, let alone that it is good to transliterate things that can be fully expressed by inherent Chinese language and characters. Let's look at a few examples. For example, 收音机 (Shouyinji) for radio is a translated meaning, which is correct and easy to understand, and everyone knows it; 麦克风 (Maikefeng) for microphone, transliterated, is terrible. 发动机 (Fadongji) for engine, translated meaning, everyone can understand; 透平 (Touping) for turbine, transliterated, is inexplicable. 国会 (Guohui) for parliament, translated meaning, understandable; 国家杜马 (Guojia Duma) for State Duma, transliterated, don't know what it is. 镜头 (Jingtou) for lens, everyone can understand; 蒙太奇 (Mengtaiqi) for montage, the more you explain, the less clear it becomes. Some people always like to say that the Chinese language and vocabulary are not enough, and we have to rely on foreign languages. Yes, we need to rely on them. However, these examples prove that we have not fully utilized the possibilities of our motherland's language and characters to express modern things and foreign things, while some people are desperately creating chaos and trampling on the motherland's language and characters.
    Suppose a female comrade is eating and reading under the light of an electric lamp, the following rather interesting question and answer may arise:
    What are you eating?
    葛瓦斯 (Gewasi). [Note]
    What are you wearing?
    Bulaji.
    What material is it made of?
    凡尔丁 (Fanerding).
    What are you doing?
    Studying (习明纳尔 - Ximingnaer).
    How wonderful! Our linguists, language reform workers, editors, and teachers! Lash out at this ugly phenomenon!
      [Note] Something seen on the signs of some cold food stores in Beijing.

    从“习明纳尔”到“布拉吉”
    严秀
    几年以前，有些报纸和刊物上，着实闹了一阵“习明纳尔”问题，好像是天外飞来了一件什么神物，得此，就可以解决一切问题似的。依照我的工作，是应该对这位“习明纳尔”先生表示敬意才对的，但是，大概到了1953年，在一次讨论干部教育的会议上，有人滔滔不绝地又在大谈其“习明纳尔”如何如何，我却忍不住问了一句道：“什么叫习明纳尔？”这一问引起了一阵小小的不安，不过这一问，对问题的澄清倒是有帮助的：所谓“习明纳尔”者，据说即中国话“自修”之义也。
    最近，报刊上经常讨论服装问题，又老是看见“布拉吉”、“布拉吉”的，也不知道是什么意思，甚是纳闷。前两天，偶然到前门外的妇女服装商店去逛了一趟，这才明白，原来整个门市挂的都是“布拉吉”——布拉吉者，即女装连衣裙之谓也。
    我并不是国粹派，主张拒绝外来的一切名词术语。但是，我坚决反对这种胡闹。在广州，球叫“波”，内衣叫“裇”，至于要到广州的有些所谓“餐厅”或者“饭馆”之类的地方去吃东西，那更是苦事，因为全部的菜单的名字，都是类似“习明纳尔”、“布拉吉”的东西，进了这种地方，比进洋监还要叫人生气。
    只能译音的如人名，勉强把他们变成中国人名，如把托尔斯泰译作“陶思道”之类，是被鲁迅先生所竭力反对过的。但不是说一切外来事物译音都是好的，更不是说中国固有的语言文字所能完全表达的东西硬要译音也是好的。试举几个例子看看。例如，收音机是译意，既正确又好懂，无人不晓；麦克风（扩音机）呢，译音，糟了。发动机，译意，人人可懂；透平（涡轮），译音，莫名其妙。国会，译意，可以理解；国家杜马，译音，不知何物。镜头，人人可懂；蒙太奇，越说越说不清。有些人总喜欢说中国的语言词汇不够用，非借重外来语不可。是的，要借重的。但是，上面这些例子，却证明了我们还没有充分利用我们祖国语言文字所具有的表达现代事物和外来事物的可能性，而有些人则拚命地在那里制造混乱，蹧踏祖国的语言文字。
    假设有一位女同志在电灯光下一面吃东西一面读书，就可能产生下面这样颇为有趣的问答：
    你在吃什么？
    葛瓦斯。〔注〕
    你穿的什么？
    布拉吉。
    用什么料子做的？
    凡尔丁。
    你在做什么？
    在习明纳尔。
    这多好看啊！我们的语言学家、文字改革工作者、编辑和教师们！对这种丑恶的现象进行鞭挞吧！

  种什么东西。
