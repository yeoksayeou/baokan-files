Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 27th: At a grand farewell banquet held here tonight, Prince Souvanna Phouma told representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou that he would bring the greatest love and enthusiasm of the Chinese people to the Lao people. He raised his glass to toast the eternal friendship between China and Laos.

The Prime Minister, at the beginning of his speech, said that after nearly ten days of visiting, they were now saying goodbye to the Chinese people in Guangzhou. He said that the richest content of their trip was the warm and friendly reception of the Chinese people. They saw the hard work of the people of this great country and the wise leadership of the leaders of the Chinese people. Prince Souvanna Phouma also said, "Your great economic, cultural, and social construction excites and impresses us."

Finally, he expressed his regret that his visit to China was too short and asked Mayor Zhu Guang to convey his warmest respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Chinese people.

The host of the banquet, Zhu Guang, first spoke at the banquet, saying that we believe that Prince Souvanna Phouma and the distinguished guests will understand during this visit to China that the Chinese people love peace and are eager to be friendly with all countries, especially Asian and neighboring countries. His Royal Highness the Prince emphasized in his speeches the Kingdom of Laos' policy of peace and neutrality and its position of supporting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and his willingness to develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with our country, which has given us a deep impression. Zhu Guang also said that we believe that the good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Laos, as well as economic and cultural relations, will be further developed on a new basis.

After tonight's farewell banquet, the guests watched Cantonese opera. The guests arrived in Guangzhou by special plane at just after 5:00 pm today.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 27th: Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Lao Royal Government delegation visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge here today while flying from Shanghai to Guangzhou on a special plane.

The guests, accompanied by Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and the person in charge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, took a special boat to visit the Yangtze River Bridge Water Area. Prince Souvanna Phouma, who studied engineering in his early years, spoke with Zhang Yuerui, an engineer accompanying him, in French, inquiring in detail about the depth and flow rate of the Yangtze River and the construction methods, and watched some pictures related to the bridge. The Prince praised the most advanced construction methods used in the bridge to the people accompanying him and said that the bridge would be very beautiful after it was completed.

The Lao guests also attended a casual banquet held by Zhang Tixue at the Deming Hotel in Hankou. At 3:00 pm, the guests boarded a special plane again and flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou.
