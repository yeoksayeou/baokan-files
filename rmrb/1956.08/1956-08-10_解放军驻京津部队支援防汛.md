Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Beijing and Tianjin areas are actively supporting the people of Hebei Province in their fight against the floods. The leading organs of the troops in the Beijing area had previously issued instructions to do a good job in flood prevention. For more than a week, the duty staff officers of the Beijing area troops headquarters have been recording the flood situation on maps day and night and reporting it to their superiors, as if they were recording enemy movements. On the night of August 3rd, when the Beijing Municipal People's Committee requested the troops to rescue thirty farmers trapped by the flood on a sandbar in the Yongding River, Major General Zeng Mei immediately instructed the duty room to organize the rescue. After consultation with relevant units, the Navy, Air Force, and Engineering Corps dispatched two amphibious vehicles, one large and one small rubber boat, one folding boat, and one small landing craft, under the command of Senior Colonel Gao Panshi of the Engineering Corps, departing at 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM respectively to the trapped area for rescue. During the day, an airplane was also dispatched to airdrop twenty bags of steamed buns to the farmers who had been trapped for three days and two nights.

    解放军驻京津部队支援防汛
    据新华社9日讯　中国人民解放军驻京津地区部队官兵正在积极支援河北省人民同洪水斗争。北京地区部队领导机关事前已发出了做好防汛工作的指示。一个多星期以来，北京地区部队司令部的昼夜值班参谋人员，像记录敌情一样每日每时地把洪水情况在图上标示出来报告给首长。八月三日夜，当接到北京市人民委员会要求部队援救在永定河沙岛被洪水困住的三十名农民时，曾美少将立即指示值班室组织援救工作。经与有关单位协商，由海军、空军、工程兵出动水陆两用汽车两辆，大小橡皮舟各一只，折叠舟一只，小登陆艇一艘，在工程兵高盘石上校指挥下，分别在午夜两点和早上五点出发到被困地区营救。白天还出动一架飞机向被困三天两夜的农民空投了二十袋馒头。
