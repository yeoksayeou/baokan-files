    Friendship in the Rapids
    Han Zi
    A good friend of mine experienced a dangerous event.
    He was swimming in the middle reaches of the Wei River, with two other comrades swimming ahead of him. They looked at the beautiful banks, drifting with the gentle and rapid current, planning to swim two or three *li* in one go. The water deepened, and they saw whirlpools at the bends, but they were brave and wanted to swim through! To dive through the deep pools was the highest fighting joy.
    My friend is not an excellent swimmer. He merely believed he could swim through, his technique lagging behind his courage. The first whirlpool dragged him down, he gasped, but immediately calmed down, remembered where he was, held his breath, pushed aside the waves, and surged to the surface. But immediately something grabbed his legs, he was submerged in the second whirlpool, and flung to the side, unable to get his bearings, seeing the most terrifying dark trap he could imagine, how he longed to see the green banks again. He told himself, "Don't panic, don't panic!", while kicking away the invisible hands grabbing him, and also trying to make his hand movements conform to the requirements of diving, he finally emerged from the water again.
    The vaguely visible whirlpool ahead was preparing to continue teasing him, he felt so tired that it was difficult to fight back, and wanted to ask for help from the comrades in front. He shouted loudly, "Wait a moment, wait a moment!" One of the comrades closer to him heard the shout and turned his head, but he only glanced blankly and then turned back to swim away. My friend saw hope but immediately felt discouraged, but he did not blame others, not everyone has the ability to save people in the rapids, and even less can one assume that this comrade did not offer a helping hand because of selfishness and cowardice... Then, be braver yourself, but the waves hit him, and he fell into the whirlpool again. There was no sound in the world, he only felt his body sinking, sinking, sinking, he knew he couldn't sink like this, because this was the final departure from the world he loved. With a final struggle, he rose to the surface, but he still didn't escape the whirlpool, remembering that the foremost comrade might be able to help him, he shouted loudly. When he poked his head out of the water again, he finally saw the foremost comrade swimming towards him, how happy, he was indeed swimming towards him, he felt that dear comrade was extending his hand to him with all his life's strength. He was no longer isolated and helpless, the whirlwind-like rapids were no longer his enemies, he was swept down, but immediately emerged more stubbornly, fighting excitedly and heroically. The closer the hand in front was to him, the more bravely he fought, the more confidence he had, and finally he swam out of danger himself. But he felt that it was the comrade who extended his hand that truly saved him, he could hardly find words to express his gratitude, only to remember this friendship in the rapids for a lifetime, thinking about how beautiful the person who gives hope is, and that he himself should be an inextinguishable small lamp in the night navigation.

    激流中的友谊
    菡子
    我的一个很好的朋友经历了一件危险的事。
    他在潍河中游水，另外还有两个同志游在他的前面。他们看着美丽的两岸，顺着既温和也湍急的水流，准备一口气游出两三里路去。水深了，在拐弯的地方，看见了漩涡，可是人是勇敢的，要游过去！能潜过深潭，有最高的战斗的愉快。
    我的朋友不是一个出色的游泳家。他仅是相信自己能游过去，技术比他的胆子小。最初的漩涡就把他拖下水去，他喘息着，不过立刻镇静了，想起自己在什么地方，就屏住气息，推开水浪，冲上了水面。可是马上有什么东西又抱住了他的两条腿，他淹没在第二个漩涡中间，并被甩向一边，摸不清楚水路了，看见的是他想像中最可怕的黑暗的陷阱，他多么渴望再看见那青青的两岸。他一面嘱咐自己：“别慌，别慌！”，一面用力踢开抱住他的无形的手，也尽量使自己手的动作，合乎潜水的要求，他终于又冒出水面。
    前面隐约的水涡准备继续作弄他，他感到疲乏得难以应战，就想求助于前面的同志，他大声喊道：“等一等吧，等一等吧！”离他较近的一个同志听见了喊声，回过头来，可是他只茫茫地看了一眼，就又掉头游去。我的朋友看见了希望但又立刻泄了气，不过他不怪别人，不是每一个人都具有在激流中救人的本领，更不能设想这个同志没伸过支援的手是由于自私和胆怯，……那么，自己更勇敢一些吧，可是浪花击打着他，他又陷入了漩涡。世界上没有任何的声音，他只觉得身体在向下沉去，向下沉去，他知道不能这样沉下去，因为这就是最后离开可恋的世界。他以最后的挣扎，升上水面，可是他仍没有挣脱漩涡，想起还有最前面的一个同志也许能够帮助他，就大声叫喊起来。他又一次从水中露出头来的时候，终于看见最前面的同志已向他游来了，多么高兴，确确实实是向他游来的，他觉得那个亲爱的同志在以生命的全副力量，向他伸过手来。他不是孤立无援的了，那旋风似的激流不再是他的敌手了，他被卷下去，但立刻就更顽强地冒出头来，亢奋而英勇地战斗着。前面的手愈离他近，他就战斗得愈勇猛，愈有信心，最后他自己游出了险境。不过他觉得真正拯救他的还是那伸过手来的同志，他简直找不出言辞可以说明他的感谢，只有一辈子记住这种在激流中的友谊，想着给人希望的人有多么美好，而自己也该是一盏夜航中不灭的小灯。
