    Don't Let Hair Turn White Waiting
    To the Editor:
    I am a mother of two children. My husband, Shi Xi, used to teach at Yixing County No. 1 Middle School in Jiangsu Province. In April 1951, I obeyed the unified allocation of the motherland and was transferred from East China to work in Changchun. The two children were left to my husband to take care of. During these long five years, my husband and I have had many emotional rifts due to long-term separation.
    We have also repeatedly raised opinions to the organization, hoping to be transferred to work together. In 1953, the leaders of my unit once tried to transfer him to the Northeast through the former Government Administration Council, but the leaders of Yixing County No. 1 Middle School ignored it. This March, both of us again requested a transfer through the organization. This time, the Yixing County Education Bureau and Yixing County No. 1 Middle School have both agreed to transfer my husband to work in Changchun, but the official documents were transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, which has been delaying a reply. After repeated urging, they recently sent a letter, always saying: "Work requires that he cannot be transferred." I really don't understand: why have my husband's direct leaders – the Yixing County Education Bureau and Yixing County No. 1 Middle School – approved it, but the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education does not agree? Are they unaware of the situation below? Or are they indifferent to the suffering of the masses?
    Editor, according to the regulations of the education department, job transfers must be done during the summer vacation. Now it is the summer vacation, but it looks like it will not be resolved this year. My husband is already forty-two years old. If we wait any longer, we may both have white hair when we meet.

### 不要让头发等白了

    不要让头发等白了编辑同志：
    我是一个两个孩子的妈妈，我爱人史希曾在江苏省宜兴县第一中学教书，1951年4月，我服从祖国统一分配，由华东调到长春工作，两个孩子留给我爱人负责照管。在这漫长的五年多的日子里，我和我爱人因长期分离，相互间在感情上有了许多裂痕。
    我们也曾经多次对组织上提意见，希望能调在一起工作。1953年我所在单位领导上曾通过前政务院调他来东北，谁知宜兴县第一中学领导上不理不睬。今年三月我们双方又通过组织要求调动，这一次宜兴县教育局及宜兴县第一中学都已同意将我爱人调来长春工作，可是公文转到江苏省教育厅，该厅一直拖延不作答复，经再三催促，最近才来信，总是：“工作需要，不能调动”。我真不明白：为什么我爱人的直接领导——宜兴县教育局和宜兴县第一中学都批准了，而江苏省教育厅却不答应，是他们不了解下情呢？还是对群众疾苦置若罔闻呢？
    编辑同志，按教育部门规定：调动工作一定要在暑假，现在正是暑假，但看样子今年还是解决不了。我爱人现在已经四十二岁了，再等待下去，见面时恐怕已白发双双了。
