Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd. Kaifeng, a city that was historically an inland river shipping port in our country, has now regained its position in inland river shipping. The Huiji River, a tributary of the Huai River that runs through the city, had been dry for more than twenty years, but has now been revived with the help of water drawn from the Yellow River through the Yellow River Siphon Project at Heigangkou in Kaifeng. The opening of the Huiji River to navigation connects the Yellow River and the Huai River. Wooden sailboats laden with various industrial and agricultural products can now sail from Kaifeng to various towns in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River.

Kaifeng is one of China's six ancient capitals. According to historical records, before the end of the Song Dynasty, there were four rivers here, including the Bian River and the Huimin River, and inland river shipping was very developed at that time. Later, due to repeated breaches and changes of course by the Yellow River, all four rivers were silted up by sediment from the Yellow River. In 1739, the Qing Dynasty used the old course of the former Bian River and manually excavated the Huiji River, which runs through the central plains of eastern Henan. However, due to the narrow river and shallow water, navigation here was not well-developed until before liberation. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, this river channel became silted and dried up. In 1953, the People's Government built the Yellow River Siphon Project at Heigangkou in Kaifeng, and then repaired the Huiji River channel, which had been silted up for twenty years. In mid-June of this year, water from the Yellow River began to be released into the Huiji River, and navigation on this river channel began to be smooth.

After this river channel is opened to navigation, it will bring great convenience to the exchange of industrial and agricultural products on the vast eastern Henan plain. The cost of using shipping is about three-quarters cheaper than transportation by car. In the future, with the expansion of the Yellow River diversion project and the continued deepening and widening of the Huiji River channel, the amount of Yellow River water released into the Huiji River next year will increase from the current 5.5 cubic meters per second to 50 cubic meters per second. By then, tugboats from the lower reaches of the Huai River will be able to reach Kaifeng directly; the waterway from Kaifeng to various ports along the Yangtze River will also be open.

### 把黄河和淮河连接起来  惠济河道又通航了

    把黄河和淮河连接起来
    惠济河道又通航了
    新华社郑州3日电　历史上曾经是我国内河航运码头的开封市，现在又恢复了它在内河航运方面的地位。横穿这个城市的淮河支流惠济河，已经干涸了二十多年，现在被从开封市黑岗口的引黄虹吸工程引进来的黄河水帮助复活了。惠济河的通航，使黄河和淮河两大河流连接起来。满载着各种工农业产品的木帆船，现在可以从开封一直航行到淮河中下游的各个城镇。
    开封是我国的六大古都之一。根据历史记载，在宋末以前，这里有汴河、惠民河等四条河流，当时内河航运十分发达。后来，因为黄河历次决口改道，这四条河道全被黄河里的泥沙淤平了。1739年，清朝曾借用从前的汴河旧道，用人工开挖成了这条横贯豫东中部平原的惠济河，但因河窄水浅，这里航运一直到解放前也没有很好通航过。抗日战争爆发以后，这条河道就淤塞干涸了。1953年，人民政府在开封市黑岗口修建了引黄虹吸工程，接着又整修了已经淤塞了二十年的惠济河道，在今年六月中旬开始把黄河水放入惠济河，这条河道的航运便开始畅通。
    这条河道通航以后，将给广大豫东平原上的工农业产品交流带来很大便利。使用船运要比汽车运输的价格便宜四分之三左右。今后随着引黄工程的扩建，惠济河河道继续加深加宽，到明年放入惠济河的黄河水将可以从目前的五点五秒立方公尺增加到五十秒立方公尺。到那时，来自淮河下流的拖轮可以直抵开封；从开封到长江各口岸之间的水路也将可以畅通。
