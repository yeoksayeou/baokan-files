	“If the Master does not speak, then what shall we little ones transmit?”
	Yan Xiu
	Once, for some reason—perhaps because he discovered that his disciples had too much "dogmatism"—Confucius suddenly said to his disciples: "Alas, I really don't want to talk much." Upon hearing this, Zigong became anxious and said, "Oh my, what will become of us! If you don't speak, what will we do?!" Confucius said: "What are you worried about! When has Heaven ever spoken? Doesn't the four seasons still operate there? Don't the five grains and all things still flourish and grow there? When has Heaven ever said anything!" ("The Master said: 'I wish to say nothing.' Zigong said: 'If the Master does not speak, then what shall we little ones transmit?' The Master said: 'Does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed and all things are produced. Does Heaven speak?'" – Original text from "The Analects") This dialogue is truly excellent, profound, humorous, and vivid. Reading it now, one still feels as if one can hear their voices and see their faces.
	Confucius was, after all, a great educator. It seems he did not approve of his disciples committing "dogmatism," he wanted them to use their brains and develop their own independent thinking abilities. But he did not talk bombastically, he only used sixteen characters to vividly and humorously oppose "dogmatism" and oppose intellectual laziness.
	Zigong's demeanor here is particularly laughable. But our modern Zigongs are too numerous. Aren't some of our scientific workers, theoretical workers, and writers very similar to Zigong here? In writing books, making speeches, and writing articles, they have no ideas of their own, no language of their own, and even less a style of their own. The paper is full of quotations with quotation marks and quotations without quotation marks. Everything must have a "basis," and this basis does not refer to the results of seeking truth from facts and independent research, but whether Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have said it somewhere, or whether Chairman Mao has said it somewhere. If they have said it, then there is a "basis," if they have not said it, then it is called having no "basis." In short: "If the Master does not speak, then what shall we little ones transmit?"
	Here a problem arises: there was no Marxism before Marx. If Marx and Engels had also adopted this attitude, then the "Communist Manifesto" would not exist, nor would "Das Kapital." Science and creation are two names for the same noun. Science is the enemy of blind obedience, superstition, dogmatism, and adherence to tradition, etc., but it is the brother of doubt, research, collecting materials, independent thinking, creation, and innovation, etc.
	Dogmatism is a gust of hot wind blowing from the tropical desert, and also a gust of cold wind blowing from the frigid desert. Regardless of cold or heat, the vigorous vitality is swept away by it: trees, flowers, plants, cattle, sheep, and humans, either freeze to death or wither. Isn't science, art, and theory all like this? If one only repeats what others say, only quotes scriptures and classics, only repeats the principles that predecessors have said thousands of times, and one is not satisfied with doing so oneself, but also forces others to do so, then what vitality is there to speak of? Isn't that as good as being alive but dead?
	After dogmatism becomes the trend, some people not only treat the works of Marxist masters as dogma, but also unconsciously some people emerge who rely on the name of Marxism to dogmatize science, and some people emerge who are sealed or self-proclaimed as petty popes. The result is: biology must depend on someone, history must depend on someone, literature must depend on someone, and philosophy must also depend on someone. Like fetishism, the land has a land god, the broom has a broom god, the stove has a stove god, the door has a door god, the fire has a fire god, the water has a water god, everywhere there are taboos, everywhere one can touch bad luck. In such a situation of "everything is unsuitable, everything is inauspicious," what fresh and lively things dare to appear?
	Comrade Mao Zedong said: "From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should sum up and inherit this precious legacy." ("The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War") I have not studied Confucius, so I cannot say what should be inherited. But it seems that, at least, this passage of Confucius must be inherited by us no matter what.

    “子如不言，则小子何述焉……”
    严秀
    有一次，不知为了什么原因——也可能是发现了他的弟子们“教条主义”太多了的原故——，孔夫子忽然对他的弟子们说：“唉，我真不想多说话了。”子贡一听了就发急道：“哎哟，怎么得了！你要不开口了，那我们怎么办呢？！”孔夫子说：“你急什么！天什么时候说过话呢？一年四季不是照样在那里运行吗？五谷百物不是照样在那里发荣滋长吗？天什么时候说过什么呢！”（“子曰：予欲无言。子贡曰：子如不言，则小子何述焉？子曰：天何言哉？四时行焉，百物生焉。天何言哉！”——原文见“论语”）这段对话实在太好了，深刻、幽默而生动。现在来读它，还觉得如闻其声，如见其人。
    孔夫子毕竟是一个伟大的教育家。看来他不赞成他的弟子们犯“教条主义”，他要他们开动脑筋，发挥自己独立的思考能力。但是他没有夸夸其谈，只用了十六个字就很生动、幽默地反对了“教条主义”，反对了思想懒汉。
    子贡在这里的神态，特别令人发笑。但是我们的现代的子贡却是太多了。我们的某些科学工作者、理论工作者、作家们，不是和这里的子贡很相像吗？著书立说、讲话作文，没有自己的思想，没有自己的语言，更没有自己的风格。满纸是有引号的引文和没有引号的引文，一切都要有“根据”，而这个根据并不是指的实事求是的、独立研究的结果，而是马、恩、列、斯在什么地方讲过没有，毛主席在什么地方讲过没有，讲过了的就有“根据”，没有讲过的就叫做没有“根据”。总之：“子如不言，则小子何述焉？”
    这里发生了一个问题：在马克思之前是没有马克思主义的，如果马克思和恩格斯也是采取这个态度，那么“共产党宣言”就没有了，“资本论”也没有了。科学和创造是一个名词的两种叫法。科学和盲从、迷信、教条、因袭等等是敌人，而和怀疑、研究、收集材料、独立思考、创造、革新等等则是兄弟。
    教条主义是热带沙漠吹过来的一阵热风，又是寒带沙漠吹过来的一阵冷风，不管冷和热，总之活泼泼的生机，遇着它就一扫而光了：树木啊，花草啊，牛羊啊，人类啊，不是冻死，就是枯死。科学、艺术、理论哪一件不是这样呢？如果只是人云亦云，只是引经据典，只是重复前人已经千百次地说过了的原理原则，自己这样做了还不够，还要强迫别人也这样做，那么，还有什么生机可言，还不是虽生犹死是什么呢？
    教条主义成了风气之后，有些人就不仅仅是把马克思主义大师们的著作当成教条，而且在不知不觉间出现了一些仗着马克思主义的名义来武断科学的人，出现了一些被封或者自封为小教主一样的人物。结果是：生物学要依某人，历史学要依某人，文学要依某人，哲学又要依某人。就像拜物教一样，土地有土地神，扫把有扫把神，灶有灶神，门有门神，火有火神，水有水神，处处都是禁忌，处处都可以触楣头。在这样“诸事不宜，凡事不吉”的情况下，有什么新鲜活泼的东西敢出现呢？
    毛泽东同志说：“从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，继承这一份珍贵的遗产。”（“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）我没有研究过孔夫子，说不出该继承些什么。但是看来，至少孔夫子的这一段话无论如何我们是必须继承而且非继承不可的。
