Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: Vice Premier Hong Myong-hui announced this evening that the Korean people have victoriously completed the industrial gross output plan stipulated in the post-war Three-Year Plan for the Recovery and Development of the National Economy four and a half months ahead of schedule.

Hong Myong-hui made this announcement when he delivered a report at the Pyongyang Municipal People's Celebration of the 11th Anniversary of Korea's Liberation held at the Moranbong Theater.

Hong Myong-hui said that by July 30 this year, the level of industrial production had exceeded 96% of that in 1949. As of the end of May this year, 70.6% of all farm households had joined agricultural production cooperatives. The irrigated area has been expanded by 90,000 cho (one cho equals 15 mu) since the war, and a bumper harvest is expected this year.

Hong Myong-hui also said that in the three years since the war, the state-stipulated retail prices of consumer goods have been reduced by more than half, and the monetary wages of workers have also increased. In the past three years, the state has funded the construction of residential buildings with a construction area of more than 3.6 million square meters. Recently, the Korean government has adopted new measures to increase wages and reduce prices.

In his report, he pointed out that the declaration of the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party encourages the Korean people to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Korean people advocate establishing a democratic unified government representing the interests of all Korean people through free elections in the North and South by peaceful means.

When talking about the international situation, Hong Myong-hui said that the Korean government and the entire Korean people fully support Egypt's measure to nationalize the Suez Canal.

After Hong Myong-hui's report, Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Ivanov, delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference.

Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and other leaders of the Workers' Party and the government attended today's conference. Leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations, as well as senior generals of the People's Army, also attended the conference.
