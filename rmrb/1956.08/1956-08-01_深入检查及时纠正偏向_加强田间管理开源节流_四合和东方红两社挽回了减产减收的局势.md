Xinhua News Agency Report: The inspection team of the Sihe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, recently inspected the quality of cultivation and field management operations of all production teams in the cooperative. The inspection team found that many production teams had falsely reported their achievements to the cooperative's management committee in the past.

The inspection team found: For example, the Second Production Team still had more than 140 mu (each mu equaling 1.5 city mu) of corn that had not been hoed a second time by July 16, but the leader of the Second Team reported to the cooperative that "all the second hoeing has been completed." The Twenty-first Production Team reported that "eighty mu of sorghum land has been fertilized," but in reality, only thirty mu had been fertilized.

Because of the false reports, about 500 mu of crops in the cooperative now have serious weed growth, which may lead to reduced production.

Based on the results of the inspection, the Sihe Cooperative criticized the production teams that made false reports. It severely criticized and educated certain people who had the mistaken idea of making false reports in order to show off their personal achievements, using the fact of crop neglect as evidence. Now, the production teams that have not achieved the original cultivation plan are concentrating their manpower to catch up.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Licheng County, Shandong Province, recently revised its production plan to strive for more than 90% of its members to be able to increase their income during the autumn distribution.

The cooperative recently inspected the implementation of the production plan and found that many agricultural and sideline production targets in the first half of the year had not been completed due to the original plan being too high and the lack of raw materials. According to the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, it is estimated that the total value of agricultural and sideline production for the whole year can only reach 520,000 yuan, which is more than 106,000 yuan less than the original plan. This would not guarantee that more than 90% of the members would increase their income.

In order to change this situation, the management committee of the cooperative decided to take urgent measures to open up production avenues and increase income. In terms of sideline production, it was decided to immediately resume production at the lime kiln, which had been closed for more than two months. The flour mill, which has good sales, will increase personnel and expand production, and all twenty-five machines in the straw bale group will strive to be put into operation. In addition, the cooperative has also increased sideline businesses such as processing flour for units outside the cooperative using electric mills, and contracting building houses outside the cooperative by construction teams, in order to increase cash income.

In terms of agricultural production, in addition to strengthening field management to ensure a bumper harvest in the autumn, it was also decided to raise more pigs, accumulate more soil fertilizer, and use less commercial fertilizer to reduce production costs.

After careful calculation, increasing income and reducing expenditure, the revised plan of the entire cooperative can generate a total income of 581,800 yuan. After deducting various expenses, it is estimated that the members can be allocated more than 370,000 yuan, and the remuneration for each work day will be about 1.88 yuan. In this way, more than 90% of the members may increase their income during the autumn distribution.

    深入检查及时纠正偏向
    加强田间管理开源节流
    四合和东方红两社挽回了减产减收的局势
    据新华社讯　辽宁省凌源县四合农业生产合作社的检查组，最近检查了全社各生产队的中耕、田间管理等作业的质量。检查组发现不少生产队过去向社务管理委员会汇报工作都有假报成绩的现象。
    检查组发现：例如第二生产队到七月十六日止还有一百四十多亩（每亩合一点五市亩）玉米没有铲二遍，但二队队长却向社报告说“已经全部铲完了二遍”。第二十一生产队报告说“已经有八十亩地高粱追了肥”，实际上却只有三十亩追过肥。
    因为虚报成绩，现在，这个社约有五百多亩地的作物有严重的荒芜现象，可能减产。
    根据检查的结果，四合社批评了假报告的各生产队，对某些人为了表现个人，假报成绩的错误思想和行为，通过作物荒芜的事实，作了严厉的批判和教育。现在，没有实现原订铲趟计划的生产队，正集中人力抓紧铲趟。
    据新华社讯　山东省历城县东方红农业社在最近修订了生产计划，争取90％以上的社员在秋季分配时能够增加收入。
    这个社最近检查了生产计划的执行情况，发现今年上半年有好多项农、副业生产指标因为原计划偏高和缺乏原料都没有完成。按照上半年计划执行情况预计，全年农副业生产总值只能达到五十二万元，比原计划要减少十万零六千多元。这样就不能保证90％以上的社员增加收入。
    为了改变这种状况，这个社的管理委员会决定采取紧急措施，开辟生产门路、增加收入。在副业生产方面，确定把已经停业两个多月的石灰窑立即恢复生产。产品销路较好的粉房，增加人员扩大生产，打草包组的二十五盘机子，争取全部开工。另外，还增加了用电磨为社外加工磨粉、建筑小组到社外包建房屋等副业，以增加现金收入。
    在农业生产方面，除了加强田间管理，保证秋季丰收外，还决定多养猪，多积土肥，少用商品肥料，降低生产成本。
    经过精打细算，开源节流，全社修订后的计划共可收入五十八万一千八百多元，扣除各项开支，预计社员可以分到三十七万多元，每个劳动日的报酬约在一元八角八分左右，这样，90％以上社员在秋季总分时就可能增加收入。
