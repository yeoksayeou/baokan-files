In the "Philosophical Series" published in New York, USA in 1955, there was a book written by Crouse entitled "Dewey's Nihilism." This was a sensational work in American philosophical circles after Harry Wells' "Pragmatism, Philosophy of Imperialism" (1954). This book is divided into three parts. The first part, entitled "Replacing Science," criticizes Dewey's instrumentalism. The second part, entitled "Replacing Art," criticizes Dewey's views on art as developed in his book "Art as Experience." Crouse exposed the close connection between the general philosophical premises of Dewey's doctrine and his artistic ideas. The author argues that Dewey's views on art, as well as his doctrine of experience, are irrationalist and subjectivist, and their purpose is to eliminate art. The third part of this book criticizes the educational theory described by Dewey in "Experience and Education." Dewey's educational theories have had a great influence in the United States. Crouse focuses on exposing the biological process of education advocated in Dewey's educational doctrine. His criticism of Dewey's educational doctrine has significant practical implications today.

The valuable aspect of Crouse's book lies in taking the criticism of pragmatism's doctrine of experience as the center of criticism. Furthermore, the characteristic of this book in terms of writing is that the author does not adopt a critical method of opposing his own views to Dewey's views, but instead uses a research and analysis method to peel away the layers and tear off Dewey's consistently self-proclaimed profound mask. There are benefits to using this method. Because Dewey, during his lifetime, always slandered others for not understanding his thoughts when answering criticisms of him, and said that his thoughts were distorted, etc.

    美国进步学者批判杜威
    1955年美国纽约出版的“哲学丛书”中有一本书是克劳塞写的“杜威的虚无主义”。这是继哈利·威尔斯著“实用主义、帝国主义的哲学”（1954年）之后，轰动美国哲学界的一部著作。这本书分三部分。第一部分以“代替科学”为题，批判了杜威的工具论。第二部分以“代替艺术”为题，批判了杜威在“艺术即经验”一书中发挥的艺术观点。克劳塞揭发了杜威学说的一般哲学前提和他的艺术观念之间的密切联系。作者论证了：杜威的艺术观点以及他关于经验的学说，都是非理性主义和主观主义的，其目的是要消灭艺术的。这本书的第三部分批判了杜威在“经验和教育”一书中叙述的教育理论。杜威的教育学说在美国影响很大。克劳塞着重揭发了杜威教育学说中主张的教育的生物化过程。他对杜威教育学说的批判，在今天有重大的现实意义。
    克劳塞这本书可贵之处在于以批判实用主义关于经验的学说作为批判的中心。再就是这本书在写作上的特点是，作者不采用拿自己的观点和杜威的观点对立起来的批判方式，而是用研讨、分析的方式，层层剥露，撕下了杜威一向自诩高深的假面具。采用这种方式有它的好处。因为杜威生前在回答别人对他的批判时，一向诬蔑人家理解不了他的思想，并说他的思想被人歪曲了等等。
