    Library development is an important indicator of a country's cultural and scientific level. In the march towards science, libraries are a necessary condition. Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call to bring China's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced levels within twelve years, cultural departments in various regions have gained a new understanding of the importance of libraries. Some provinces and cities have already made arrangements and taken specific measures; however, many other places have not yet taken action. Recently, the Ministry of Culture convened a National Library Work Conference, focusing on discussing library services for scientific research and exchanging views on the development plan for libraries. All relevant parties should act quickly to ensure that library work rapidly meets objective requirements.

    The tasks of libraries in the march towards science are roughly two: one is to provide books and materials for scientific research work, that is, to serve scientific research; the other is to popularize cultural and scientific knowledge and cultivate scientific reserve forces through the borrowing and reading of books and periodicals. Neither of these two tasks should be neglected. However, due to the different nature, foundation, reader situation and needs of different libraries, the distribution of surrounding libraries, etc., specific tasks of a library can be determined according to the time, place, and specific library conditions. Generally speaking, specialized scientific and academic libraries should focus on serving scientific research; county and city public libraries should focus on serving the general public and popularizing cultural and scientific knowledge; provincial and municipal public libraries should be determined based on specific circumstances. In short, it is required that within a region, both tasks of the library in the march towards science can be undertaken by libraries, each in its proper place, so that the needs of scientific researchers and the needs of the general public can be appropriately met.

    How can libraries serve scientific research?

    First of all, libraries should have the necessary collections. In recent years, the number of books and periodicals collected by Chinese libraries has increased significantly. According to statistics at the end of 1955, public libraries alone had approximately 30 million volumes of books and periodicals. It is estimated that the number of books in the libraries of the Academy of Sciences, universities, government departments, enterprises, institutions, and trade unions is much larger than the number in public libraries. These collections have three situations: 1. A large backlog. Among the approximately 30 million volumes in public libraries, about 10 million volumes have not yet been sorted and put on the shelves, and other libraries also have a lot of backlogs. 2. Some books have too many duplicates or are improperly distributed. 3. Books that have been sorted out cannot be fully utilized due to poor management, too strict borrowing rules, and cumbersome procedures. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to sort out and allocate existing books, improve management and borrowing rules, so as to give full play to the role of existing books and periodicals. At the same time, new books and periodicals should be supplemented in a planned way, especially searching for scientific classics and the latest books and periodicals from all over the world, and collecting valuable old books and periodicals from China's past to ensure the needs of scientific research.

    Compiling book catalogs and indexes, helping readers understand the collection, and making full use of the collection is also a necessary task for libraries to serve scientific research. The catalog is a tool for promoting books and helping readers find books, and it is a bridge connecting books and readers. However, the catalog work of libraries is very poor, and too few catalogs are compiled, so the phenomenon has emerged: on the one hand, books are waiting for people, and on the other hand, people cannot find books, which greatly affects the progress of scientific research. For example, paleontologist Yang Zhongjian spent two or three years looking for two reference articles, and it was not until this year that he found them in the library of the Academy of Sciences, and then completed his works. Obviously, if the library of the Academy of Sciences had compiled and printed a catalog, Yang Zhongjian's works would not have been delayed for two or three years. This shows the importance of catalog work. Therefore, libraries should actively and systematically carry out the compilation of catalogs and indexes. And the relevant libraries should contact and cooperate to compile special joint catalogs.

    The borrowing system and methods of books and periodicals should be improved to give readers as much convenience as possible. For scientific workers and academic workers, in addition to expanding the scope of borrowing, increasing the types of borrowing, and simplifying borrowing procedures, some provincial-level or above public libraries and specialized libraries with conditions should also set up special or expert reading rooms, expand interlibrary loans, build micro-reading equipment, carry out book copying, and so on.

    At present, the number of libraries in China is insufficient and the quality is not high, which needs to be actively developed to meet the growing needs; however, there is a certain limit to cadres and funds, and scientific research work is also developing gradually. Therefore, the development of libraries should adopt a positive and steady approach. On the one hand, according to the current situation, we should emphasize the full utilization of the existing foundation, strengthen, enrich and improve the existing libraries, give play to their potential, and provide them with the necessary cadres and funds to carry out the necessary basic construction to solve the current urgent problems. On the other hand, we should also see the vision of researching and designing library development, gradually carry out new construction work in a planned way, and gradually accumulate book information.

    The library system has many systems, and the nature and types are various, the distribution is very uneven, and there are many overlaps in the work. Therefore, comprehensive planning must be carried out to avoid blindness in development and duplication and waste in work. The cultural departments of various regions should take the initiative to understand the situation of all libraries in the local area, strengthen contact with them, and adjust them in terms of career planning. Libraries in other departments should also consciously take care of the comprehensive planning of the cultural departments.

    To do a good job in library work, we should mobilize and organize the forces of all parties to work together. We should mobilize and organize the forces of the cultural department system, the Academy of Sciences system, universities, and the libraries of various important enterprises and trade union libraries, change the past state of doing their own things, and achieve unified coordination, contact and cooperation in some major businesses to better serve scientific research and the public. We should mobilize and use the forces outside the library, such as scientists, professors, engineers, writers, etc., to learn about the needs and solicit opinions from them, and ask them to help formulate plans for supplementing books and compiling catalogs, find ways to purchase books, answer questions about books, conduct symposiums and lectures, etc., so that they can fully utilize the library and help the library's improvement. We should pay attention to training and improving the original cadres of the library and training new cadres to ensure the improvement and development of library work.

    向科学进军中的图书馆工作
    图书馆事业的发展，是测量一个国家文化科学水平的一个重要标志。在向科学进军中，图书馆是必要的条件之一。自从中共中央提出在十二年内使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界先进水平的号召以后，各地文化部门对于图书馆事业的重要性已经有了新的认识。有些省、市已经进行布置，采取若干具体措施；但还有不少地方没有行动起来。最近，文化部召开了全国图书馆工作会议，着重讨论了图书馆为科学研究服务的工作，并对图书馆事业的发展的规划交换了意见。各个有关方面应该迅速地行动起来，使图书馆工作迅速赶上客观的要求。
    图书馆在向科学进军中的任务，大致有两项：一项是为科学研究工作提供图书资料，也就是为科学研究服务；一项是通过书刊的借阅，普及文化科学知识，培养科学的后备力量。这两项任务是不可偏废的。但是，由于图书馆的性质不同，基础不同，读者情况和需要不同，周围图书馆分布情况不同，等等，可以因时、因地、因馆制宜，确定某一个图书馆的具体任务。一般地说，专门的科学学术性质的图书馆，应该以为科学研究服务为主；县、市的公共图书馆，应该以为广大人民服务，普及文化科学知识为主；省、市公共图书馆要看具体情况而定。总之，要求在一个地区之内，使图书馆在向科学进军中的两项任务都能够有馆负担，各得其所，使科学研究工作者的需要和广大人民群众的需要都能够得到适当的满足。
    图书馆怎样为科学研究服务呢？
    首先是图书馆应该具备应有的藏书。近几年来，我国图书馆所收藏的书刊大量增加，据1955年底的统计，单是公共图书馆就有三千万册左右的书刊。估计科学院、高等院校，政府各部门、各企业、事业以及工会等图书馆的藏书数量比公共图书馆的数字还要大得多。这些藏书有三种情况：一、大批积压。在公共图书馆三千万册左右的藏书中，约有一千万册还未整理上架，其他方面的图书馆也有不少积压。二、有些图书复本太多或者分配不当。三、已经整理出来的图书由于管理不好，借阅制度太严，手续太繁，因而不能充分利用。所以，目前最急迫的工作是清理和调配现有的图书，改进管理和借阅制度，以便充分地发挥现有书刊的作用。同时，还应该有计划地补充新的书刊，尤其是搜罗世界各国科学的古典著作和最新的书刊，并且收集有价值的我国过去的古旧书刊，以保证科学研究的需要。
    编制图书目录和索引，帮助读者了解藏书情况，使藏书得到充分利用，这也是图书馆为科学研究服务所必需进行的工作。书目是宣传图书、帮助读者查找图书的工具，是图书同读者联系的桥梁。可是图书馆的书目工作做得很差，编制书目太少，因而就出现了这样的现象：一方面是书等不着人，一方面是人找不到书，大大地影响科学研究工作的进行。例如古脊椎生物学家杨锺健两三年来寻找两篇参考文章，直到今年，才在科学院图书馆里找到了，于是完成了他的论著。很明显的，要是科学院图书馆编印了书目，杨锺健的著作就不致推迟两三年了。由此可以看出书目工作的重要。所以图书馆应该积极地有计划地进行书目和索引的编制工作。并且各有关的图书馆应该联系合作，编制专题联合书目。
    应该改进书刊的借阅制度和方法，给读者以尽可能的方便。对于科学工作者和学术工作者，除了应该扩大借书范围，增加借书种类，简化借书手续以外，有些有条件的省以上公共图书馆和专业图书馆，还应该设置专门的或专家的阅览室，扩大馆际互借，建设显微阅书设备，进行图书的复制工作，等等。
    目前我国图书馆数量不足，质量不高，需要积极地加以发展，才能适应日益增长的需要；但是干部和经费却有一定的限度，而科学研究工作也是逐步地发展的，因此，图书馆事业的发展，应该采取积极而稳步的方针。一方面应该根据目前的情况，强调充分利用现有基础，加强、充实和提高现有的图书馆，发挥它们的潜力，并给以必要的干部、经费，进行必要的基本建设，解决目前紧迫的问题。另一方面还应该看到研究和设计图书馆事业的远景，有计划地逐步进行新的建设工作，并逐渐积累图书资料。
    图书馆事业有很多系统，在性质类型上又是各式各样的，分布很不平衡，工作上有许多交错，因此必须进行全面规划，才能避免发展当中的盲目性和工作上的重复浪费。各地文化部门应该主动地了解当地所有图书馆的状况，加强同它们的联系，并且在事业计划方面加以调节。其他部门的图书馆也要有意识地照顾文化部门的全面规划。
    要做好图书馆的工作，应该动员和组织各方面的力量，协同动作。应该把文化部门系统、科学院系统、高等院校和各重要的事业、企业的图书馆和工会图书馆的力量通统动员组织起来，改变过去各自为政的状态，在一些主要的业务方面，做到统一协调、联系合作，更好地为科学研究服务和为大众服务。应该动员和运用图书馆以外的力量，如科学家、教授、工程师、文学家等等，经常从他们那里了解需要，征求意见，并请他们帮助制定补充图书和编制书目的计划，找寻采购图书的门路，解答有关图书的问题，进行座谈演讲工作，等等，做到使他们充分地利用图书馆，并帮助图书馆的改进和提高。应该注意培养和提高图书馆原有的干部和训练新的干部，以保证图书馆工作的改进和发展。
