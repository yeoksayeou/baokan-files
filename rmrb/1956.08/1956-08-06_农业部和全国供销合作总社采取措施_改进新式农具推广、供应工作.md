Xinhua News Agency, August 4th. The Ministry of Agriculture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have taken measures to improve the promotion and supply of new farm tools. In addition to revising the promotion and supply plans for double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows this year, it has been determined that the supply of double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows in the second half of the year will adopt a "free purchase, cash transaction" sales method. All forms of sales on credit are strictly prohibited, and various disguised forms of compulsory allocation are strictly forbidden. The amount purchased should be based on the actual needs and willingness of farmers, and the completion of promotion plans should never be forced.

Currently, hundreds of thousands of double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows have begun to be transferred to rural areas in the north to meet the needs of autumn and winter plowing.

In the first half of this year, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country sold a total of 784,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows, an increase of eleven times compared to the same period last year. The double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows that have been supplied to farmers, in areas where the models are suitable, the supply is timely, and a series of problems such as animal power, usage techniques, and parts supply have been resolved, have mostly been used for agricultural production. In most of the plains and dry farming areas of the north, double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows have played a significant role; more than 80% of them in the northeastern provinces have been put into agricultural production in a timely manner. In the paddy field areas of the south, the use of double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows is very poor, with a general usage rate of less than 40%, and some agricultural cooperatives have not used them at all. This is because the promotion and supply plans were too rash and did not meet the real needs of farmers; cadres in many regions, special districts, counties, and districts, without considering whether the local terrain and soil quality were suitable, and whether technical training and modifications for use in paddy fields had been resolved, simply took the wrong approach of compulsory allocation in order to complete the promotion task.

### 农业部和全国供销合作总社采取措施  改进新式农具推广、供应工作

    改进新式农具推广、供应工作
    新华社4日讯　农业部和全国供销合作总社采取措施，改进新式农具推广、供应工作。除目前正在修正今年双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的推广、供应计划外，已经确定下半年双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的供应，采取“自由买卖，现钱交易”的销售方式，一律不准赊销，严禁各种变相的强迫摊派现象，根据农民实际需要，自愿购买多少，就销多少，绝不强求完成推广计划。
    现在，数十万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁已经开始调往北方各地农村，以适应秋耕和冬耕的需要。
    今年上半年，全国各地供销社共卖出双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁七十八万四千多部，比去年同期销售数量增加了十一倍。已经供应到农民手里的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁，凡是型号对路、供应适时以及畜力、使用技术、零件供应等一系列问题得到解决的地区，绝大部分已经用于农业生产。在北方大部平原旱作地区，双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁发挥了显著的作用；东北各省有80％以上适时投入农业生产。在南方水田地区，双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的使用很不好，一般使用率在40％以下，有些农业社根本没有使用起来。这是由于推广、供应计划太冒进，不切合农民真正的实际需要；不少地区的专区、县、区干部不考虑当地地形土质是否适合，技术传授、下水田改装等问题是否已经解决，单纯为了完成推广任务，错误地采取了强迫摊派的作法。
