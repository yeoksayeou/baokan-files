Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 20th - Yumen Oil Mine has begun to test the latest achievement in petroleum exploration technology - atomic energy radioactive logging - at the Laojunmiao Oilfield. It is the first time for China to use atomic energy to explore for oil.

Recently, radioactive logging was tested inside the casing of a well, and the results were good. The geological conditions of underground sandstone and clay were clearly analyzed. The current radioactive logging tests use two methods: gamma logging and neutron logging. This involves putting a special downhole instrument into the well and using the natural radioactivity of the rock or the reaction to artificial radioactive elements to detect underground geology and oil-water layers. It has great advantages over general electrical measurements: measurements can be made in cased wells; changes in underground strata can be accurately measured when the mud resistivity is very low; and the oil-water boundary problem in oilfield development can be solved. In the past, these could not be completely resolved with the old technology. Before liberation, due to low technical level, the oil layer depth and oil layer quality of many old wells in the Laojunmiao Oilfield were unclear. Now, radioactive logging can solve this problem.

The radioactive logging test will last for three months. This test is jointly conducted by the Radioactive Logging Test Team of the Physical Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Geology and the Logging Brigade of the Geophysical Department of the Yumen Mining Bureau.

    玉门油矿利用原子能探测石油
    新华社玉门20日电　玉门油矿开始在老君庙油田上试验石油探测技术上的最新成就——原子能放射性测井。利用原子能探测石油，在我国还是第一次。
    最近在井下套管内试验放射性测井，效果良好，很明显地分析出了地下沙岩、粘土的地质情况。目前进行的放射性测井试验，用的是珈玛测井和中子测井两种方法。这就是把一套特殊的井下仪器放入井中，利用岩石天然放射性或对人工放射原素的反应，探测井下地质和含油水层情况。它比一般电测具有极大优越性：可以在下过套管的井内进行测量；可以在泥浆电阻率很低的时候准确地测出井下岩层变化情况；可以解决油田开采上的油水边界问题。这些，以过去的技术是无法彻底解决的。解放以前，由于技术水平低，老君庙油田许多老井的油层深度、油层好坏等都搞不清楚，现在利用放射性测井可以解决了。
    放射性测井试验将进行三个月。这次试验是由地质部物理探矿局放射性测井试验队和玉门矿务局地球物理处测井大队联合进行的。
