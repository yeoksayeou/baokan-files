    Cutting off one's nose to spite one's face
    In the Shanghai Turbine Factory, there is a row of single dormitories. In the past, after work, some of the workers living in these dormitories liked to turn on the radio and listen to music, while others liked to turn on a small desk lamp and read for a while. Recently, the power sockets in these dormitories have suddenly been removed. The radios are now mute, and the small desk lamps are blind, leaving only the electric lights hanging from the ceiling still lit.
    It is said that removing the power sockets was entirely out of good intentions. Because this can prevent electric shock, allowing the workers in these dormitories to be in an absolutely safe state.
    Faced with this ridiculous phenomenon, people can only ask those comrades who decided to remove the power sockets to think again: besides this "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face" method, is there really no other way to ensure the safety of the workers' electricity use?

    因噎废食
    上海汽轮机厂有一排单人宿舍。住在这些宿舍里的职工们，过去在下班以后，有的爱打开收音机听听音乐，有的爱点亮了小台灯看一会儿书。最近，这些宿舍里的电源插头忽然都被拆掉了。收音机哑了口，小台灯瞎了眼，剩下来的只有悬在天花板上的电灯还亮着。
    据说，拆掉电源插头完全是出于好心。因为这样可以防止触电，使这些宿舍里的职工们能够处于绝对安全的状态中。
    面对着这种令人哭笑不得的现象，人们只好请那些决定拆除电源插头的同志再想一想：除了这种“因噎废食”的办法以外，是否真的就没有别的办法保证职工们的用电安全呢？
